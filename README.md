# AlphaBridge
Analysis on the choice of the lead in the game of Contract Bridge.


--------------------------------------
## Modules:
This project is designed in modules, each of them has different usages:
1. data: Downloads .lin files from Vugraph in BBO [5] and parses files to create hdfs dataframe. Also functions to search for specific biddings

2. learning: Different approaches to try and learn through the data of expert players, using CNN and ML methods

3. reinforcement_learning: Uses reinforcement learning based on the articles [1][2], using the OpenAI gym [4] and DDS [3]

4. legacy: Old functions and datasets in the older format.


## Contents:
### Data
This is the data module. It contains:
1. bbo: Scripts to download the .lin bbo files and those files compressed as raw_lin_data_i.7z

2. parser.py: parses the .lin files and creates a hdfs dataframe.

3. store.hdfs: hdfs dataframe

4. tools.py, enum.py: auxiliary functions and auxiliry dicts, used by parsing

5. symmetry.py: symmetry proposed by a Bridge player, that would generate more data for the case of No trumps


### Learning
Folder with learning methods based on CNNs and ML:
1. 1nt.ipynb: Approach using Scikit learn machine learning machinery

2. CNN_version1_for_1NTPPP.ipynb: Approach using CNN with TensorFlow

3. Deep Learning: Approach using FFNN with TF

4. example_CNN: example of CNN using the new dataframe

5. template_use_data, path_jupy, template_use_data.py: Legacy.


### Reinforcement Learning
[TODO]


### Old
1. encode_and_parsing:

  a. encode: Encode and Decode the String representing the bidding to an array of numbers
  
  b. parsing: functions for reading the hands of players and determining the lead. Hands are encoded in 4 52-vectors of booleans representing the presence or not of the card, one for each player

2. parseHeading: Tools to decode the heading of .lin files according to HowToReadHeading

3. HowToReadHeading: Human decoding of .lin headings



## Bridge Vocabulary:
[TODO]

## Aknowledgements
