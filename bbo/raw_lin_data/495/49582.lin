mb|6H|nt|kit:  South will certainly double|pg||

nt|kit:  I would expect declarer will misguess the diamonds and go down|pg||
nt|kit:  When North shows up with the stiff heart|pg||
nt|kit:  Spades could be 6-3|pg||
nt|kit:  And even if they are 5-4, South could be 5-5 in the blacks|pg||
nt|kit:  So it seems likely that he will misguess, but we shall see|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h4|pc|hJ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|Psyck:  The two (or 3) extra cards that South is known to have in majors makes the @d finesse percfentage.|pg||

nt|kit:  So with South holding only 5 spades ...|pg||
nt|kit:  I don't know why declarer didn't ruff a club and ruff an spade before makin his guess|pg||
nt|Psyck:  69% to finesse @d if 5 card @s with S and 77% if 6 card @s with South.|pg||
nt|kit:  27 IMPs riding on this guess|pg||
nt|kit:  I am really surprised declarer didn't try to get a count for sure in spades -- as he could have done so at no cost at all -- very sloppy|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfj: sorry finger slipped|pg||
nt|Psyck:  a few hearts slipped beating|pg||

nt|kareno: best would be a club lead I think.|pg||
nt|kareno: South fell in love with his hand.  But that distribution is not going to work for him.|pg||
nt|kit:  West has interesting lead problem|pg||
pc|hK|nt|kit:  trump makes a lot of sense on the auction|pg||
nt|kit:  So how can declarer possibly come to 11 tricks|pg||
nt|kit:  Even if spades behave, only 5 clubs, 3 spades, 1 heart, and 1 diamond is 10 tricks|pg||
nt|kit:  So need 2 ruffs someplace in addition to everything else|pg||
nt|kit:  I guess it is possible if things behave due to the great trump spots|pg||
nt|kit:  More convenient to ruff 2 hearts in dummy, as need to take 2 spade finesses|pg||

pc|h2|nt|kit:  This lead looks pretty reasonable, as partner could have 4 hearts behind dummy's 4 hearts|pg||
