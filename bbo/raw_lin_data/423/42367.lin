mb|4S|nt|kit: yep|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dA|pc|d4|nt|kit: 4@S doubled looks like a likely contract for sure|pg||
nt|bettinakal:  Difficult to defeat 4!, needs a @h shift now|pg||
nt|warrens:  the defense needs to shift to @h's now|pg||
nt|kareno:  They's better get their heart trick fast!|pg||
nt|kit: But West might have bid 4NT|pg||
pc|d5|nt|bettinakal:  But how can West see that...Cant keep his hands from @c A|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|kit: After taking 2 diamonds, heart shiftt seems reasonable|pg||
nt|kit: If he trusts pard to have 7 clubs for vul vs. not preempt|pg||
nt|kareno:  Not after 3@c opener vulnerable|pg||
nt|villain:  unless partner has the Jof spades and the upper cut is the winner|pg||
nt|kit: seems like he has to cash 2nd diamond, as pard might have a stiff|pg||
nt|warrens:  agreed.  Kit's defense makes sense|pg||
nt|kareno:  I like bidding 4nt better than having to defend on this hand|pg||
nt|villain:  3 small hearts don't make 4N appealing|pg||
nt|kit: 4@S undoubled making, so full board swing on the defense here|pg||
nt|bettinakal:  West is for sure thinking.....|pg||
nt|warrens:  if he thinks declarer has the @h King, he could play for an uppercut, hoping partner has the @s J|pg||
nt|warrens:  this decision could decide the event|pg||
nt|kareno:  It's been nip and tuck all along|pg||
nt|warrens:  according to usbf.org, Gordon still leads by 0.61|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|pc|hK|nt|kit: wow!|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|nt|lrobb98:  some overcall with S hand here, very light....|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lrobb98:  action action.......|pg||
nt|lrobb98:  what to lead..1NT is so tough to defend....often 7 tricks turns into 5 or 6....|pg||
nt|lrobb98:  spade will beat it, if they take their tricks.....quickly..tough to do tho....|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: N thinking very hard about the lead|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c2|pc|c8|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|hK|nt|lrobb98:  remember a famous 1NT XX to finish..last oard..a major event several years ago, when smoke cleared 8 tricks on defense turned into 6.....|pg||
nt|lrobb98:  gier can try the J of spades, but Pepsi really has not much choice, at some point has to put up the K...holding....|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h3|pg||
nt|lrobb98:  incredible last hand coming up..|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d7|pc|d2|pc|d5|pg||
nt|lrobb98:  N has a tough play..we can see of course does not matter too much.....great try with K of diamonds tho|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dQ|pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d6|pc|h8|pc|s5|pg||

mb|1C!|an|2+|mb|1D|nt|bettinakal:  bidding here:  1@C - p - 1NT?|pg||
mb|1S!|nt|bettinakal:  didnt count on 1@d from S...    :)|pg||
nt|kareno:  Zatorski is in his thirties I'd say and Pachtmann a little older  Zatorski told me he's been playing for 15 years.  5 are Polish and Pachtmann is Israeli|pg||
mb|d|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|nt|kareno:  Big partscore battle here|pg||
mb|2S|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kareno:  I think Zatorski/Pachtmann are a new pair|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kit: West in 1NT doubled at other table|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sA|pc|s5|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|pc|s7|pc|s6|pg||
nt|warrens:  so, this will win a point back for Gordon.  winner of the last board wins the event.  if pushed, Gordon wins.|pg||
mc|8|nt|kareno:  Looks like it will make 1nt|pg||
pg||

mb|1C|an|Polish|mb|p|mb|1D!|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|lrobb98:  disciplined 1 spade bid here(it is the normal bid, but some jump..)....|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|lrobb98:  so do you bid 2NT or spades.....|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|warrens:  uh oh.  I don't this will make on any lead|pg||
nt|warrens:  except the 3 of @c|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|lrobb98:  a diamond could get ducked(unlikely but...)......|pg||
nt|kareno:  Any n/s plus ...|pg||
nt|lrobb98:  I am sure Pepsi will be very dissapointed when the H is off.....|pg||
nt|lrobb98:  2 spades would have probably won the event..push....|pg||
nt|kit: What if club lead ducked -- might North err and continue with a small club?|pg||
nt|lrobb98:  so if Pepsi(West) leads a diamond, N pops and leads a ??....or ducks, and what does S do??..great hand.....|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: clock has gone off several miutes ago|pg||
nt|warrens:  yes, possible, but I assume South will discourage clearly|pg||
nt|lrobb98:  right....|pg||
nt|kit: how would south discourage clearly with king-doubleton?|pg||
nt|kareno:  but not with the 8!!|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c8|pc|cA|pg||
nt|lrobb98:  that could be K8 doubleton of course.....interesting.....|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s6|pc|sJ|pc|s4|pg||
nt|kareno:  Well, that's a cry for a shift - but to what?  Hearts I guess.  |pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|sQ|pc|s7|pg||
pc|sK|nt|kareno:  The 8 is too big a card to throw here.. risky|pg||
pc|d8|nt|kit: Hard to see the defense getting anything wrong now|pg||
pc|d6|pc|s8|pg||
nt|kareno:  Now it's clear|pg||
pc|sT|pc|d5|pc|d7|pc|h2|pg||
nt|warrens:  yes, running @s makes it straightforward because South knows what to ask for.  he didn't have to be such a clear @h position|pg||
nt|lrobb98:  never know..its late, tired, and S is under a bit of pressure anyway.....|pg||
pc|s9|pc|d3|pc|h5|pc|h6|pg||
nt|lrobb98:  S has to be careful here to keep a club......|pg||
pc|s2|pc|h9|pc|h4|pc|h8|pg||
nt|lrobb98:  S could have pitched the A of diamonds, anything but his club.....|pg||
nt|kareno:  Amazing end to this tournament.  Specs you are so lucky!|pg||
nt|kit: South following good fundamental discarding principles -- keep winners, throw losers.|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c6|pc|cK|pc|c3|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d4|pc|d2|pc|dA|pg||
mc|8|nt|lrobb98:  great end..........|pg||

nt|vugraphzfc: teammates came running to table|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: lots of cheerin|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Vainikonis wins|pg||
nt|TopWizard:  Congrats to Vainikonis|pg||
nt|warrens:  very exciting, great bridge and a real test of endurance|pg||
nt|lrobb98:  the winners cheer and the losers say how about another hand.....deal the cards....|pg||
nt|kareno:  Love it!  Good night all - see you in Reno|pg||
