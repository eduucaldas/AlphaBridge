Two stalwarts of Australian bridge. The grizzled veterans will be wanting to teach the young pups a lesson or two.|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|nick jacob:  Sitting West is the baby-faced assassin, Matthew Brown -- also known as "The Ginger Helgemo." His partner is Michael Whibley, the finest theologian-turned-ecologist that NZ bridge has ever produced.|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  Both partnerships are playing 2/1 with a number of specialised gadgets.|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|nt|nick jacob:  Although the boys do play non-serious 3NT, I believe that was not an option here -- 3NT would have been a suggestion of contract.|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|nick jacob:  Matt B has done well to take the bull by the horns holding the diamond control that Whibley had denied.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|nick jacob:  This contract is reasonable. There are three suits that have options -- trumps, diamonds and clubs.|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  It feels as though if 2/3 of them behave, the contract should succeed|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dT|pc|d3|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  Today we see no demons in the diamond and spade positions, so it should make pretty handily|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  maybe Whibley will play spade ace, club king, club ace, club, intending to ruff, cross to the spade king, ruff clubs good and use the diamond ace as the entry to cash the fifth club for a heart pitch|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  this would be necessary if spades were 3-1 and clubs 4-2 with North holding the doubleton|pg||

pc|d5|pc|s4|pc|c9|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  of course, on a heart lead there is a lot more pressure in the play. So perhaps the contract is not so good. However it seems clear to lead a diamond from Beauchamp's hand|pg||
