nt|Lady007:  4@C then sets hearts|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Is this slam better than the one before? Difficult to judge really|pg||
nt|Lady007:  in situations where they are several possible trump suits, NS always play that 4@C sets the one in which you have the lowest possible game. In this case hearts|pg||

nt|Lady007:  Levin leads a trump, knowing that north has a singleton club and that there is nothing to set up in that suit|pg||
nt|nilsland:  it all depends of the feeling you get as declarer when dummy comes down |pg||
nt|Lady007:  he also has control of the hand, with so many HCP, so trump lead safest|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|fuquay:  This could be interesting --- NS need to get their clubs immediately to beat 3N|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bt:  interesting lead problem here|pg||
nt|bt:  majors are taken so maybe a club?|pg||
nt|bt:  he better ;)|pg||
nt|bt:  this auction is a typical @D lead usually, but with that club holding ...|pg||
nt|bt:  theory being that north didnt double 2@C, but when you have KQx his clubs are too bad to double|pg||

nt|nilsland:  misfit on both sides|pg||
nt|nilsland:  usually ends with 3N|pg||
nt|vugrapho1: they claim every hand from the first one:) |pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|2H|nt|Lady007:  2@C is GF relay. Its their only GF bid|pg||
nt|Lady007:  Unfortunately I dont play the same responses as they do so I am not sure about the continuation|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|nilsland:  so you have made some changes in the system after all, Marion :)|pg||
nt|Lady007:  2NT i think shows 8-10 points where A=3K=2Q=1 and 10 cards in 2 suits. no void|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|Lady007:  3@C asking|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the only other time i saw the 2@H overcall   DBL was described as 5-7 zz      where zz = what marion described|pg||
nt|Lady007:  and 3@H shows diamond side suit|pg||
nt|Lady007:  I think they keep the system here, as 2@H doesnt take away any steps (pass and double becoming the 2@D/2@H bid)|pg||
nt|Lady007:  and they actually had 2NT written down in their notes so I think my guesses are pretty good here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: adjustment to zz   singleton K=1  singleton Q=0    [marion please correct if i'm wrong]|pg||
nt|Lady007:  yes|pg||
nt|Lady007:  so south has 8 ZZ here|pg||
mb|p|nt|nilsland:  In a relay system  here. You cant find out if spades is weak or strong.|pg||
nt|Lady007:  Nystrom thinking now. He can ask again and then he will have to play 4@S (at least) if south has 64|pg||
nt|Lady007:  of maybe he can just bid 3NT and play that instead?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|Lady007:  but asking will still get him to 3NT if south has 55|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Lady007:  he figured that 3NT should be fine regardless|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h4|nt|Lady007:  lead is not really worrying declarer :)|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hK|pg||
nt|nilsland:  If S hand was AQJxx/x/Axxxx/Qx the bidding would probably be the same|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c3|pc|cA|pc|c2|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h6|pc|s4|nt|Lady007:  yes. impossible to find out below 3nt|pg||
nt|Lady007:  but a natural system wouldnt have helped you there either|pg||
nt|ahollan1: which system identifies  opponent's singleton @HQ and on-side @CQ?|pg||
nt|nilsland:  perhaps if N started with 2@C natural but I suppose he would bid 2@H|pg||

nt|ahollan1: tomorrow's vugraph line-up   http://championships.worldbridge.org/lyonwt17/bbo-schedule|pg||
nt|Lady007:  will South double? or is he warned by wests bid of the misfit?|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Lady007:  He reasoned west might also bid like this with 23 in the majors, or they can have a good minor fit|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ahollan1: unlike original 2@S=pass/correct   many now play that the 2@D bidder will 'correct' with 2N or 3@C  allowing ew to play in a minor|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|pc|hK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: OR  2@S bidder can have own @S suit which is shown by rebidding 3@S|pg||
nt|Lady007:  Interesting decision for declarer. He can play the queen, to prevent EW from playing more hearts directly. but the hearts might be 51 or he might get spades through, all not too attractive|pg||
nt|vugrapho1: johan shakes hands and goes away|pg||
