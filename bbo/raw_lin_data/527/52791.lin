nt|Lady007:  im a bit surprised East hasnt played back a heart yet. This wont be the first time his partner responds 1NT with 4+ support and no cards|pg||
nt|Lady007:  or does he see options that I dont see?|pg||
nt|Lady007:  the weird thing is also what happened to the spade suit|pg||
nt|Lady007:  north didnt support spades or didnt bid them|pg||
nt|Lady007:  ergo partner must have 4 spades|pg||
