mb|p|nt|kit: Annoying problem for North.  4@H was bid maybe to make, so they have a good save -- if 4@S is going down|pg||
nt|kit: If 4@S making, he wants to bid.  if 4@S going down, he wants to double.  But he doesn't know which.|pg||

pc|d3|pc|dJ|pc|d6|pg||
nt|kit: Good technique by all -- South plays jack to locate queen.  West ducks, to keep control of things and cut defensive communication.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|kit: Declarer would rather play South for Ax of spades, but the entries are awkward for that, so he may be forced to get the spades right.|pg||
nt|kit: Problem declarer has is that if he plays AK of hearts early, defense can draw third trump and declarer might be held to 4 hearts, 1 spade, 1 diamond, 1 club.|pg||
nt|kit: But if he doesn't play top trumps, he runs into some trump promotion risks.|pg||
nt|kareno: He won't want to ruff a diamond and weaken his trumps|pg||
nt|kit: He might win ace of diamonds, diamond ruff, club up -- basically planning on scrambling a lot of trump tricks.|pg||
nt|kit: playing a spade along the way to set up a spade trick.  Proper timing of all this is far from clear.|pg||
