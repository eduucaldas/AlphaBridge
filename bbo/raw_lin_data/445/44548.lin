nt|Vugraphzfh: The tempo of this auction suggests they aren't totally on the same page. Hampson said he wasn't sure about Greco's 2@S bid|pg||

nt|shuster:  N/S system notes here http://usbf.org/docs/2016usbc/acblcards/InfernalMachine2016.pdf|pg||
mb|p|nt|shuster:  so South should bid 2@S to ask about North's hand|pg||
mb|2S!|mb|p|mb|3S!|nt|shuster:  Since South has bid NT already, and North thinks NT likely strain, he doesn't want to describe the declaring hand for the defense|pg||
nt|shuster:  so has switched who is relaying|pg||
nt|shuster:  3@S shows 3325|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|shuster:  This gives south the option of 5@C, which would be -1|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfc: NS confirm that N has shown 3=3=2=5|pg||
pc|s5|nt|shuster:  North should probably not have continued the relay opposite 1NT and just bid 3NT.  A good reason to do what he did would be if his diamonds were in fact xx|pg||
nt|shuster:  if so, he wouldn't know whether to play NT or 4-3 major fit for example, but his partner would|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfh: Almost always off, but Precision plays 2@D as forcing|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h7|nt|ahollan1: even more than that  most play  TRF over 1@D:neb - DBL|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h8|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: And over 1@D (2@C) and 1@D (3@C)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and maybe the "neb" qualifier of "could be short" explains why raise = F1 after overcall|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Some over 1@D (2@S) too|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Yes, diamonds is more like a new suit than a raise|pg||
nt|ahollan1: makes me wonder if pairs who open 1@C=2+ also retain inverted raise after opp overcall|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Plus you have 3@D as a NF raise, and with limited openings you don't need to slice these things too fine. What's the difference between PRE and mixed opposite 10-15?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2 more letters to type mixed?|pg||
