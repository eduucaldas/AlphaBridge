nt|Vugraphzfh: I wonder how much Harris' double was influenced by the disaster on the previous board|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfh: One lose 11 is recoverable. A lose 11 followed by the roof caving in probably isn't|pg||

nt|3for3:  I assume it was a crash 'response' pass or correct|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Not certain. Might have been pass or correct if 1@D was CRASH. I couldn't read the alerts|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3:  Harris probably knew his partner had minors, was hoping for stiff spade, and 2 ruffs, Ace of Diamonds maybe a trick in the wash|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfh: But that's huge to hope for|pg||
mb|2H|nt|bucheister:  but it put no pressure on them|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Even if you catch the stiff and two trumps, that's only down one. And what actually happened is definitely possible|pg||

mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|Vugraphzfh: Compton fiddles with his bidding box, eventually pulls out 3@S with characteristic flair|pg||
