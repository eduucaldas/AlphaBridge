mb|p|nt|shuster:  so 2@S cuebid is 6-7 with four card support or 8-9 with 3 card support|pg||
nt|shuster:  still 3@H would have been sensible, to take away the 3-level from the opponents|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Cenk wrote "LR." It might be better to have given the explanation Michael just did, as E-W play such a non-standard system|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Even if you define that as a limit raise, seems like full disclosure would be to say 6-7 with 4+ or 8-9 with 3|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: JD pulls out 5@D, puts it back in the box|pg||
nt|shuster:  a slow 3NT is the worst thing he can do|pg||
nt|shuster:  someone needs to bid spades again if N/S are to go plus in a game|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: JD could cuebid, letting Brian bid 3@S|pg||
nt|shuster:  at the other table, South drove the 5-level in a competitive auction.  A little unlucky to go -1 in 5@S.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: And even if you then continue with 3NT, Brian can pull|pg||
mb|3H|nt|shuster:  I think 3@H is the call here.  |pg||
mb|d|nt|shuster:  it is only surprising it took so long.  And all this wiggling at the 3-level, perhaps E/W ought to reconsider the wisdom of the 2@S bid|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Oh and Cenk's double gives them plenty of room. Brian's 3@S bid will be voluntary now|pg||

mb|p|an|alerted|nt|shuster:  those overcalls that take up no room aren't usually a good idea|pg||
mb|p|nt|shuster:  but East is interested in slam, so doesn't stop off to take  a piece of 2@S|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: So this is a relay sequence now?|pg||

nt|shuster:  West will bid 3@C to show high short|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfh: @Sxx = short?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: I suppose relatively speaking|pg||
nt|shuster:  they don't go below this track, so XX would be a relay break by either player|pg||
nt|shuster:  although West "can't" have a penalty double of 2@S, so if he XX's they will know the wheels have come off|pg||
nt|shuster:  or if he X's, I mean|pg||
nt|shuster:  All those XX's should be read as X's instead|pg||

mb|p|nt|shuster:  which could be enough if they are the right 3... KQx of hearts and the @CA make a cold slam|pg||
mb|4H|an|3 controls|mb|p|nt|shuster:  so I predict they wind up in 5NT by the time they sort it all out|pg||
nt|shuster:  if sam asks with 4@S, the response will be 5@H, showing A or K of clubs, and an honor in hearts and diamonds|pg||
nt|shuster:  but no honor in spades|pg||
mb|4S|nt|poohbear:  notice that at the other table north's lead director was a dbl of 3 nt . this might have been better if he had 2 entries in separate suits since declarer might make without the help of the heart suit|pg||
nt|shuster:  E/W system notes can be found here: http://usbf.org/docs/2016usbc/acblcards/InfernalMachine2016.pdf|pg||
mb|p|nt|shuster:  West holding the @DK means they are off the @HAK|pg||
nt|shuster:  and East will sign off in 5NT over 5@H|pg||
mb|5H|an|alerted|mb|p|nt|shuster:  So East knows the 3 controls are the @DK and @CA now, so must bid 5NT|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: So 5NT making on the nose would be another 7 imps for Diamond|pg||
nt|shuster:  but at least he knows the @HQ is there, so the suit is stopped|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|shuster:  I'm surprised by this.  Is he taking a chance?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|shuster:  So West showed 2335, 3 controls, and high honors in all non-spade suits|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h2|pc|h3|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hJ|pc|h9|nt|shuster:  so East should know he is off the hearts.  I think he must have been gambling on the lead|pg||

mc|11|nt|Vugraphzfh: That's it, see you back at 3:45|pg||
nt|shuster:  looks to me like a case of operator error, not the system fault|pg||
nt|shuster:  cheers, thank you everyone and thanks for all the helpful input from the specs!|pg||
