mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: theoretically it is better to use 3@C to show the other major - then opener under less pressure|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: but low=low suit hi=high suit   [i.e. @C=@H  @D=@S]  is absolutely default by momentum|pg||
nt|kareno: It's okay to play it this way - then opener can bid 3@h to end the auction if he hates spades.|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|nt|kareno: That's why to play 3@d invitational and 3@s forcing|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c8|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ahhh but is 3@H bid because he hates @S or likes @H    if 3@C = @S  then Opener has 3@H/@S as bids that say  I like my choice  and 3@D = YOU MADE ME BID|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and losing extra step if showing INV raise of opener's M, then extra step gains nothing|pg||
nt|kareno: I'm sure that's fine but I'm too old to change low/low - I'd forget for sure wiping out any advantage gained.|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|pc|c9|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ahollan1: even bad agreement is better than no agreement    and  forgetting agreement is worst|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i also think default is for artificial bid to show other major = INV+  and bid of 4th suit = competitive|pg||

mb|1D|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: as passed hand - is 1@D enough with east hand?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if DBL focuses on majors and @D holding suspect - then absolutely 1@D is good enough|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think with BOTH hands originally passing - you would want to preempt even a little with east hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D from Fleisher??|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: he has already denied 4+Major "with values"  so maybe cue shows @H & @S with not great values|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i'm on very shaky ground here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now 3@S??   he has to show values sometime|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, partner is a passed hand so a jump is marked with the east hand.  Steve Beatty seems to be very nonagressive with those hands.|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|kareno: I certainly prefer east's bid in the CR|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe USBF & BBO will let us play the hand again with Beatty bidding 2@D|pg||
nt|kareno: :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: too right   2@D or 3@D both vastly superior to 1@D|pg||
