mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit:  South better lead his ace|pg||
nt|kit:  Problem is that South doesn't think a club is cashing, and he may fall from grace and lead a heart|pg||
nt|ritong: i think he will|pg||
nt|ritong: dummy very often has a @c void, here|pg||
nt|kit:  But he really shouldn't take this position, as heart lead could cost contract even if club isn't cashing|pg||
nt|ritong: and he has no opposition in @ss|pg||
nt|kit:  From his point of view, likely his partner has enough in spades to stop the run of the spades.|pg||
nt|ady: 5@CX+1   was 6 to Harris|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ritong: whew|pg||
nt|kit:  A heart lead is right only if partner has king of hearts and a trick in either diamonds or spades, and opponents void in clubs, and spades good enough to run -- too much of a parlay.|pg||
