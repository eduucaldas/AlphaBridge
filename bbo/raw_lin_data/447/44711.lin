mb|p|mb|p|nt|BobThomson:  He didn't realize they were playing big club, and his partner overcalled two clubs over one club|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS nv:1/2/3 & always 4th  Precision    vul:1/2/3 2/1 Relay|pg||
nt|medwards: These players play to win not to not lose so thisa should be very intertaing.|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|BobThomson:  He thought it was Michaels, and confusion ensued - they ended up throwing the board out and replaying it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so 1@D=10-15, 2+@D|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: all pairs for Diamond play a version of RM Lite [aka meck lite]|pg||
nt|BobThomson:  do EW play natural or Michales over the nebulous 1@d opening?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for Greco   (1@D:neb)-2@H = @H & @S|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: They play 1@d 2@d is nat vs a prec @d|pg||
mb|d|mb|2H!|nt|ahollan1: 2@H looks like good raise of @S|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ady: hi all|pg||
nt|smsj: He certainly has a good raise of @S|pg||
nt|BobThomson:  that should get them to 4@s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: usually when playing 2@H = michaels it is defined as limited and some other bid [ex: 3@C] = strong Michaels|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Dunno, Greco is in the tank. Both tables are on live feed. I encourage you all to watch it. |pg||
nt|ritong: hi everyone:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i bet Greco DBL now = art game try [maximal - since no roop for other game try]|pg||
nt|BobThomson:  If W can actually play 3@Hx, that would be best|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Grue and Hampson are still scribbling about the auction|pg||
mb|d!|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|ahollan1: maybe time of an old Kantar  either-or DBL|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: with hampson void saying -- i bet penalty this time|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|d9|nt|ahollan1: cute  i've never seen this maximal dbl used with best holding in opponent's suit|pg||
nt|BobThomson:  I think Greco will make this... but maybe not|pg||
nt|ritong: first board  first blood|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Moss DBL early roll of the dice?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is 2-day 120 board match|pg||
nt|ahollan1: each day 4x15 board segments|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Day 1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so board 1 of 120 setting the tone :)|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||

nt|BobThomson:  Grue-Moss have been setting this tone all week|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|h6|pc|c3|pc|h2|pg||
nt|ady: looks home now     8 trump tricks  and 2 hearts|pg||
nt|medwards: What ever happened to Louis Prima and Keely Smith?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Willenken DID use 2@H=michaels over Platnick Precision 1@D opener|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Platnick playing 3@DX|pg||
nt|ahollan1: after board 1 - i suggest we take a break|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 4th seat always Precision  |pg||
nt|BobThomson:  should be a routine 3NT|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Grue discusses his lead and decides that he should have probably led a trump, but he knew he was leading into his pard's real @d suit|pg||
nt|ady: easy 3NT   n/s|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: i finally get that right    in the beginning of the KO rounds i explained 4th seat exactly the wrong way|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: 1@C = 16+ unbal or 18+BAL  [1N vul = 15-17]|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: DBL is NOT penalty|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think just shows values with no better bid|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: They were joking about who knew how many @hs Greco had|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS  Precision nv:1/2/3 & always 4th|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: unless using windoze bbo  click on player name to access SSF [system summary form], Convention Cards and other|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ahollan1: normally DBL =  5-7  but some add  OR  8+ with no better descriptive bid|pg||
nt|BobThomson:  Probably eleven tricks here, though declarer might misguess spades and only make ten|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|Vugraphzfg: Grue is discussing the nature of what 1N over 1@s would have been and Grue says they usually start with double but 1N is Nat GF wit ha stopper|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: While other things would have been a nat gf, 2@c would have been 3 suited over 1@s|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: By Moss|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfe: N-S play a version of Meckwell Lite precision. E-W play a short club with transfer responses|pg||
mb|1D|an|2+|mb|p|nt|3for3:  NS open very light as can be seen, a balanced 10, even vulnerable.|pg||
mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|Vugraphzfe: Diamond and Platnick are a very longstanding partnership. They won the junior world championship together in 1991|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|3for3:  3nt seems likely either way|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: By contrast, I believe Ish and Chris are a relatively new partnership|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfe: E-W also open quite light. In the pregame discussion, Brian asked about their style. They open all 11s NV and many 11s vul|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Not as light as a precision pair, but not "rule of 20" either|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|3for3:  Platnick decides not to go for penalties, despite a good spade holding an overcall by a passed hand.|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfe: Brian may be blazing a new trail for *vulnerable second seat* openers. The trend among precision pairs is to open many balanced 10-counts when NV, but not commonly when vul|pg||
nt|3for3:  His values are concentrated in his long suits, so it is a 'good' balanced 10|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sT|nt|3for3:  normal spot, just a question of overtricks|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Note that JD conducted a careful choice of games auction, not just blasting 3NT when he found out about the spade stopper. 4@H could easily be right if there's a weakness in a ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: black suit|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|Vugraphzfe: Brian might misguess on the second round of spades, hooking into Willenken's @S9|pg||
nt|3for3:  that seems normal since east is a big favorite to hold the 9|pg||
nt|3for3:  Ish might shift to a club, since that is a straight forward route to 5 tricks, give partner ajx(x) of clubs|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pg||
nt|3for3:  or even Axxxx if he assumes Platnick has 11|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: I don't know about that. Would Brian bid 2NT with nothing in BOTH minors? He might give preference to hearts with @HAx|pg||

nt|3for3:  welcome, Jack Oest|pg||
nt|joest:  it might well go 3nt here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: The players joke about the screen--they have to put a wedge of paper in it to keep it from flopping around|pg||
nt|joest:  in which cash Ish might venture a double: "find my suit"|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|3for3:  that could be costly|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Welcome Jack|pg||
mb|p|nt|joest:  In a bidding contest you wouldn't bit 3NT with the north hand.   This obviously shows heart shortness so will catch a couble|pg||
nt|joest:  hi Oren|pg||
nt|3for3:  this will be easier to double|pg||
nt|joest:  or not  :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Many play the double of a shortness-showing (or fragment-showing) bid here asks for the lead of the FRAGMENT|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|3for3:  Ah, that could explain it|pg||
nt|joest:  well that would explain it then|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: The shortness is sort of the "normal" lead, so when you want an unusual lead, it's probably for the opposite major|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|joest:  but many play the 3heart call promises 3 in the other major :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|joest:  i suspect we'll see a @d lead?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Those who play it asks for the fragment play it regardless of whether it promises 3 or not|pg||
nt|joest:  similar agreements often apply when doubling splinters|pg||
nt|3for3:  If they play double asks for spade lead, Willenken should lead a heart.|pg||
pc|h5|nt|3for3:  Were their any alerts by the defending side, re:pass?|pg||
nt|joest:  Ace and then a low one does give declarer an option|pg||
nt|3for3:  pass|pg||
nt|joest:  could play low playing west for Hxx of hearts|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: No. I think this falls under the "negative agreements aren't alertable" category|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: I'm not generally a fan of that philosophy, but I wouldn't think of alerting a pass in this situation|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Brian asks about lead agreements|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hQ|pc|h3|pg||
nt|joest:  back at the dawn of bridge they might have wandered into 5@c   that would not have been so bad :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: 3@S showed 4 spades, by the way|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: 3@H was just heart shortness, irrespective to side-suit length|pg||
nt|joest:  Delmonte might also continue a low heart just to be sure there is no accident incase partner has @Hjxx although that seems unlikely on the auction it would seem tome|pg||
