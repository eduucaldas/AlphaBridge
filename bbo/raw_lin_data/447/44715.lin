nt|lrobb98:  Few players tend to downgrade their hand, most upgrade readily..but, on a set where things are off, the aggressive bidders, who usually do well, can lose quite a bit....the minus 200 and 300's hurt....|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Sometimes a "modern" push at -300 in a 22 HCP 3NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: at least one SSF or CC from this event specifically said  "frequent upgrade, never downgrade"|pg||
nt|pdlit: Are any of these contestants not aggressive bidders?|pg||

nt|ritong: since moss is passed, hampson goes for neutrality in a visibly aggressive spot|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfe: Unless, as a kibitzer points out, they both go down|pg||
nt|lrobb98:  can he read the lead??...was middle.....and shift......tough hand.....|pg||
nt|ritong: the @h8 comes undoubtedly from 8xx|pg||
nt|drewsky:  Greco will think that partner has only 3 spades from the lead.|pg||
nt|lrobb98:  with so many 10's/9's, this was a decent "light" game...|pg||
nt|ritong: say declarer has @s AK|pg||
nt|ritong: that means pard would have @c AK|pg||
nt|ritong: and giving a @s trick would add up to 8 tricks for the declarer|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfe: Hampson asks Brad about what a 1@S rebid by East would be. Brad says "Facing an UPH, always 5 @C or a 4-4-4-1. Opposite a passed hand, things are a little different."|pg||
