mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: voice talking about possible differences between immediate 3@S and delayed 3@S   good thing for partnership discussion|pg||
nt|ahollan1: should it be strength and/or @S length differentiation|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: They can't have that much of a difference for Chip/Marty because of their 2 way weak 2 bids for @ss|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Known as Chip is a passed hand|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: based on assumption that south would get 2nd chance|pg||
