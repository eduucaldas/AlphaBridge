mb|p|nt|ahollan1: and from spec    roster for 17 teams entered in Canadian team championship next week: http://cbf.ca/BWeek/16files/Roster_Av4.pdf|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S = 10-15, but 3rd seat can be [much] weaker and/or 4-card suit|pg||
nt|medwards: Does not seem to be the right time to open one spade here.|pg||
nt|ritong: why?|pg||
nt|medwards: Might keep N-S low|pg||

mb|3D|mb|p|nt|lrobb98:  When(if) they meander into 3NT, Eric could possibly X.....|pg||

nt|ritong: like @sKQ onside?|pg||
nt|ritong: and west a bit uncomfortable|pg||
nt|lrobb98:  The def gets their 5 before Joe gets his 9....Geoff will split his spade honors, probably, crucial in the timing...|pg||
nt|bettinakal:  Ohh yes 2 tricks in @s...but Opps lead @h, so they can set up @h before I can set up the extra black trick|pg||
