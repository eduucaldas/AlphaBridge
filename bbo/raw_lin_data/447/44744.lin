pc|hA|nt|ritong: but interesting opening lead problem|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h8|pc|h4|pg||
nt|odysseus69: it doesnt go down - my usual careless look at singleton diamond|pg||
nt|ritong: leading a singleton is dangerous by nature, especially an honor and even more so with trump singleton|pg||
nt|ritong: thus geoff's choice|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ritong: kind of periscope lead|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d9|pc|dA|pg||
nt|odysseus69: good partners have right ace|pg||
nt|odysseus69: why delay?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Brad takes his time|pg||
nt|kit: N-S bought it for 4@S undoubled in other room|pg||
nt|kit: So assuming this makes, which appears to be the case, badly needed IMPs for Fleisher|pg||
nt|odysseus69: why not a trump?|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s9|pc|s5|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s3|pc|c3|pc|sT|pg||
nt|ritong: one of moss' problems is, would hampson falsecard at trick 2 with @d QJ, risking to fool his pard? i would think no|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Brad asks about remainder count--told UD original count, standard remainder count|pg||
nt|kit: This doesn't feel right, since if trumps 3-1 he is going to get cut off from the good heart if he ruffs 2 spades in dummy|pg||
nt|kit: If North has stiff diamond and South Ax of trumps he never has a chance, so he must assume that isn't the case.|pg||
nt|kit: What I really don't understand is what he is thinking about now.  If he was playing ace of spades and spade ruff, he had to have his next play ready since he wouldn't learn ...|pg||
nt|kit: anything.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Brad apologizes for taking so long. Hampson is holding his head in his hands, Greco is leaning back, hands on his head|pg||
nt|drewsky:  On this line of play, Brad will need the finesse in daimonds|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Hi Drewsky|pg||
nt|drewsky:  good morning|pg||
nt|kit: He'll probably need it on any line with trumps 3-1.|pg||
nt|drewsky:  true dat|pg||
nt|ritong: on the other hand, north has chosen to lead from a blank ace  likely, he has not singleton @d and two trumps|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|kit: South doesn't know declarer as 5 trumps, so may go up ace and try for ruff|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|pc|c8|pg||

nt|ritong: yes kit, with the nice 6/4 it looks like you want to play  on the other hand, if 2@c rolls home it roughly means you have only 1@c loser|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ritong: and that makes five tricks vs 1NT|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Greco: "What's the trick count here?" Brad: "Three for the good guys." Greco: "That's you?" Brad: "Yeah"|pg||
nt|ritong: so perhaps he thought " this looks like 50/50, and a possible whacking is always possible"|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Those boards should be 3 & 4 respectively, not 4 & 5|pg||
nt|kit: Bascially, defending 1NT means contracting for 7 tricks in notrump.  With the East hand, do you prefer to "play" in 1NT or 2@C?  That is the issue.|pg||
nt|ritong: say greco has five @cs|pg||
