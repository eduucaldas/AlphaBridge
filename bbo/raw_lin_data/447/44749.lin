nt|ahollan1: my alter ego is going to focus on closed room where nobody is typing|pg||
nt|kareno: it is forcing if you would accept a game try based on spades or notrump.  That's binary.|pg||

nt|ahollan1: bathurst bid 2@D over the DBL  and buys the contract at 2@S|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c3|nt|adamw:  If it's onside the worst the defense could do would be to play @D, and that's what he has to play himself anyway.|pg||
nt|adamw:  But all considered likely a wash.|pg||
nt|adamw:  The @C9 could be a "practice finesse", since declarer is unlikey to score a third round trick even if Q or J is onside.|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|adamw:  GIB says it doesn't matter which club declarer plays from dummy at this trick.|pg||

nt|kareno: Agreed, Kit.  |pg||
nt|adamw:  One strategy for South is to bid 3@d then 4@d, in the hope that if his partner plays him for diamonds he might cue-bid 4@H.|pg||
nt|kareno: So on the auction, North has no more than 2 spades - I would just bid game in hearts as south|pg||
mb|3D!|mb|p|nt|adamw:  I agree, Karen. Best to avoid a possible misunderstanding since 4@H rates to make from either side.|pg||

nt|joest:  I don't play club systems that often and when I do this is what happens to me :) |pg||

nt|joest:  i agree oren|pg||
nt|joest:  2@d was 7-10 any or something like that oren?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Sometimes players "fake" a pass/correct bid to imply length or shortness in a certain suit, hoping to throw their opponents off|pg||
nt|dburn:  he has quite a lot of losers and some defensive-looking values - even facing hearts, he does not want to bid too much|pg||
nt|joest:  welcome david!|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Hi David|pg||
nt|dburn:  good evening|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: The double of 2@D was 6-7, any distribution|pg||
nt|joest:  I suppose that's fair but down 60 things like that faze you a bit less if you think you have an 11 card fit :)|pg||
nt|joest:  3@s does announce long hearts.  3@h you could be 33|pg||
nt|joest:  so 3@s does tip your hand more|pg||
nt|joest:  david do you ever play club systems?|pg||
mb|p|an|double would have been takeout here|mb|3S|nt|dburn:  I played one for about twenty years, yes|pg||
mb|d|an|takeout?|mb|p|nt|dburn:  and when I did, that double of 3@s was penalty|pg||
nt|joest:  ok.  would you have bid 4@c as south?  3NT looks tempting but you could be off teh whole spade suit|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Moss adjusts JLall's second double on the tray, as they were quite far apart. JLall points at it and starts laughing|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|nt|dburn:  this auction is tricky facing 6-7 with any distribution - South's second call is not obvious|pg||
nt|joest:  4@d looks as though jlall might still be looking for a fit - in case partner is say 1-3-4-5?|pg||
nt|joest:  but I suspect this may be uncharted waters -- even for them|pg||
nt|dburn:  but we used to treat 7+ as a positive, so I would have bid 3@d with the North hand - not that this would have helped matters much|pg||
nt|joest:  ic|pg||
nt|dburn:  here, though, no one knows that anyone has a six-card suit - this could easily be a floundering auction with no one having a spade stop|pg||
nt|joest:  so Im' presuming they could have passed out 3@s? so that double showed 'extras' within context?|pg||
nt|dburn:  and no one knows what 4@h means if South now bids it|pg||
nt|joest:  but from Bathurst's perspective, once he knows partner has clubs and presumably spade shortness it takes almost nothing to make 6@c|pg||
nt|dburn:  I don't think they are allowed to pass out 3@s|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: South's pass over 3@H I believe was forcing, but I suspect North's over 3@S would not have been|pg||
nt|joest:  How could that be Oren?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: South is captain, and North is limited. How can North force South?|pg||
nt|joest:  North forced to bid over 3@h but not over 3@s?|pg||

nt|ahollan2: but on  6  fleisher couldn't resist trying 3N  which is doomed|pg||
nt|dburn:  Moss may be wondering whether to put up the king, which might be needed if South had the singleton queen|pg||
nt|dburn:  in truth, I don't think it matters what he plays, but of course he does not know|pg||
nt|joest:  that would put Bathurst on quite a weak hand for the bidding but if had this same hand with stiff Q you're right Moss would need to hop king right now|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Moss folds his cards and sighs|pg||

nt|ahollan1: bathurst in 4@D|pg||
nt|reisig: 3@s ...some great shot!|pg||
nt|kit: Bidding will help declarer pick up spades -- but he needs to use his lone dummy entry wisely|pg||

pc|sK|pc|s3|pc|s5|pc|s4|pg||
nt|kit: South really does figure to have AK of hearts for his double of 3@S, so if have to play him for ace-doubleton of clubs|pg||
nt|kit: Or can finess 10 of hearts, which works.|pg||
nt|kit: there is some control problem -- if he cashes queen of diamonds, he can get tapped out.  If not, it might get stranded.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if heknows AK of hearts on his right, then he could start clubs low from hand|pg||
nt|kit: So it looks like maybe he does have to finesse 9 of hearts|pg||
nt|marlowepi: I mean tyhat would be an option|pg||
nt|kit: If he leads spade honor now, North might to best to cover -- but that isn't obvious|pg||
nt|kit: Perhaps he should have taken first round spade finesse to keep better control of things.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: what i am saying is that there is a decision I think. If his RHO has any ace-third of clubs, he isnt dependent on the  ten of hearts|pg||
nt|kareno: He can't afford to pitch a heart- must develop that trick.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: If his RHO has ace-to-3 in clubs he can take 8 black tricks and a D unless it is too late for me here|pg||
nt|kit: A case could be made for playing heart to queen now.  Anything South does will be helpful.|pg||
