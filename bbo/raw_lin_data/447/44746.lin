nt|adamw:  In slam declarer would likely cash the top spades, then if the Q didn't drop decide whether to take the @C hook or play for a black suit squeeze.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: some use 2@H as 14+ and 2N as 12-13  but this approach seems better to me|pg||
nt|adamw:  The defense might lead a club early to remove that option.|pg||
nt|kareno: After driving the heart - but can 2 ducks in hearts foil this?|pg||
nt|adamw:  Not in 6@d they couldn't.|pg||
nt|kareno: Anyway, slam is not appealing opposite a balanced hand without 4 diamonds|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ducking twice in 6  as non-optimal as ducking trick one in grand|pg||
nt|kit: In 6@D, assuming passive lead I think declarer will lead early jack of clubs, and when not covered go up ace and take spade finesse|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfe: This makes sense with the 4@S KC for diamonds. N-S use "Corresponding Wood" when both minors are in play but neither agreed: 4@H = KC @C, 4@S = KC @D|pg||
