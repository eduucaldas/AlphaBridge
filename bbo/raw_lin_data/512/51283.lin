nt|fabsayc:  0 rebid problem after opening 1@C, i have never understood why you want to preempt partner|pg||
pc|d6|nt|chip:  The N hand isn't worth 2N, but at this Vul it is often useful to show your hand before the favorable opponents start preempting you.|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d9|pc|dK|pg||
nt|kit:  Declarer doesn't have a decent place to start.|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  fair point, Chip, though their most likely preempt suit is hearts, and you can cope with that fairly comfortably after a 1-level opening via X|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hQ|pc|h2|pc|h4|pg||
nt|chip:  True, but after say 1C-2H-P-3H-X covers a wide range. Also, will lead to playing S from the weak side (as would 1C-P-1S).|pg||

pc|c2|pc|cT|pc|cA|pc|c4|pg||
nt|kit:  If declarer leads a club to the 8, he will do reasonably well -- but still not making.|pg||
nt|chip:  Note, I'm not saying 2N is best, just that I have seen lots of hands where it is the winning decision (I lost a trials match by opening hand like that 1C, it went P-1D-1H and now we could no longer make a game, other table bid 2N-3N, no H lead, |pg||

nt|chip:  N threw E in to get a 2nd spade lead at the other table.|pg||
nt|kit:  He pretty much has to set up club trick it looks like.|pg||
nt|chip:  for down 1.|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  yes back in my weak NT days, which was over a decade, I almost never got a bad result from opening 1N. but there were scads of bad ones when we opened a strong NT hand with one of a suit|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  largely for similar reasons|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|d7|pc|s5|pc|cK|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s9|nt|chip:  That is one of the main reasons I gave up weak NT's. Also, oddly, transfer respnses to a club work much better with strong NT than weak.|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|h5|pg||
nt|kit:  Now spade back, and East will know by now he can exit with a heart safely.|pg||
nt|kit:  But on the jack of clubs, East will be squeezed, and if declarer reads the position he can get out for down 1.|pg||

nt|kit:  I have no clue why North is taking these actions|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  2S looking a bit better in light of next round call|pg||
nt|kit:  Anyway, even if East passes West will certainly double, as he knows his ace of hearts isn't worth much on offense.|pg||
nt|chip:  Well, forcing himself to take a phantom advance save isn't so great.|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  he was trying something clever with 2S, which backfired when the suit was raised|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  now he felt this was the clearest way to tell partner that hearts was their suit, period|pg||
