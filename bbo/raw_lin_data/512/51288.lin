nt|ady: club lead could be awkward if trumps 4-1|pg||
nt|kit:  He has 3 trumps, the balance of power, and the opponents are at the 4-level.  Still, maybe the danger of a double fit should have slowed him up.  I don't think state of match means anything.  He thinks he is doubling a sacrifice.|pg||

mb|2H|nt|ahollan1: 4 of 6 players on team hamman were hoping for 3-peat  after winning Senior World Championships in 2015 & 2016     |pg||
