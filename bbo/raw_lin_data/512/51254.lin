pc|sK|pc|s4|pc|d4|pc|s5|pg||
nt|kit:  He will be ruffing the last diamond with the 9 of hearts -- the question is whether to try ruffing a spade first.|pg||
nt|chip:  system triumph for EW. Other table never got H into the picture.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: system and the decision to open with a strong club|pg||
nt|chip:  it is possible double dummy to go down, but not likely|pg||
nt|chip:  would you open 1C Kit with E hand?|pg||
nt|kit:  Hi Chip.  Yes, I definitely would.  Partner won't know you have this much playing strength if you open 1@S.|pg||

nt|vugraphzfd: ew in the other room  aker-simson  play  rm precision  [aka meckwell]|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: so   simson opens east hand 1@C  and aker artificially forces to game while showing 5+@H|pg||

pc|h7|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
nt|chip:  Think I'd have led a club as W. N likely has a void, and more likely to be in H then clubs. Also, with Q, more likely to build a trick.|pg||
nt|richr48703:  the overtick was important ?|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s9|pc|sQ|pc|s5|pg||
mc|13|nt|fuquay:  Starting with A of spades actually could make things trickier if spades are 4-0|pg||

nt|fabsayc:  exclusion time?|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi:  Last hand sort of a poster child for methods that let you explore possibilities of a heart fit after 1S-1N. Or for that matter, old-fashioned go-as-you-please methods that countenance a 2H response to 1S|pg||
pc|h7|nt|fabsayc:  i dont think north came close to doing his hand justice|pg||
nt|chorush: I dont know about exclusion but I do know that 6 spades is an excellent contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: i was taught to rebid 4@D with 46 and good suit|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pc|h9|pg||
nt|chorush: Yes, but you might do that with the Qxx of hearts rather than the AKx|pg||

pc|c4|nt|Vugraphzff: Simson lets us know he is going to need some time before he plays to trick 1|pg||
nt|kit:  This looks like a very unlucky hand -- if 2@H is going down, that is|pg||
nt|chip:  don't think I would pass 2H with N hand. Afraid of missing game.|pg||
nt|kit:  On 3 rounds of clubs West can discard a diamond, then it gets sticky|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c2|pg||
pc|s8|nt|chip:  declarer off 2@c, 2@h and @d, but may have to lose a 6th trick.|pg||

pc|s5|pc|sJ|pc|sA|pg||
