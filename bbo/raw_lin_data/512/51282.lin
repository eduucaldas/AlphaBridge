nt|ahollan1: and there is one of the limiting factors for 2@S     a) if passed hand, then probably not 6  b) if unpassed hand and weak jump shifts then not that hand type   etc|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d5|nt|drewsky:  Lets suppose east had opened 2@H, then I suppose the popular choice with the south hand would be 2NT. The rules are precise: You ARE allowed to overcall NT with a small singleton, but you cannot OPEN 1NT with a small singleton. STrange Rules |pg||

nt|drewsky:  I dont like 1NT here. I would open 1NT if my stiff was in spades.|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: Zia asks if 1@s shows 5 and Graves nods|pg||
mb|3H!|an|splinter (but he wrote more)|nt|ahollan1: jump reverse = splinter|pg||
nt|drewsky:  Exactly. its the rebid problems that are the issue.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: since 1@D-1@S-2@H = natural and forcing   the jump reverse can have artificial meaning|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe 3@H can be short @S OR short @C|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Becker wrote something in addition to splinter, but in very tiny letters.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 3@H absolutely shows 4-card @S fit  it is just a question of what else is shown|pg||

mb|4H|nt|drewsky:  but NOT these guys|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2nd option   3@H = split range  either weaker or stronger than 4@H splinter   [thx Warren]|pg||

mb|p|mb|6H|mb|p|nt|kit:  6@S is a decent contract|pg||
nt|drewsky:  However, south will have to guess which minor to attack on a nuetral lead. |pg||

nt|kit:  As far as I can tell, North thought specific kings while South thought number of kings -- I can't see what else could have gone wrong.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Graves explains that  Becker showed a "big splinter with 4 spades" Zia: "he showed no kings in the minors?" Graves: "I'm not sure" Becker: "I thought 5NT asked for kings ... ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: specific kings and 6@h denied a minor king"|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ahollan1: in the early dayz of contract bridge there was larger than life figure who would berate his teammates for bidding grand slam  EVEN IF IT MADE|pg||

pc|s2|pc|h7|pc|s8|pg||
