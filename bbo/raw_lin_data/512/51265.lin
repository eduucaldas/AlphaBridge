nt|kit:  2@C opener, and West might jack it up |pg||
mb|2C|nt|shuster:  I'm guilty of having that agreement too, but I think a transfer scheme is better|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|an|ask|mb|d|mb|p|nt|kit:  I really don't understand the 2@D call.|pg||
mb|3C|nt|shuster:  establishing a force with the West hand might not be the best way to blow the opponents out, as you run the risk of partner doubling something.|pg||
nt|ritong: i guess it s a baby psych|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit:  Why give the opponents room to get in cheaply?|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  hi all|pg||
nt|shuster:  Precision 2@C openers can disguise some pretty good hands.  No reason to think the opponents can make game when you hold an ace.|pg||
nt|kit:  Now East for N-S to get to 4@H|pg||
nt|kit:  easy|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Garner thinking.|pg||
mb|4C|nt|shuster:  For E/W, the opening 2@C promised six clubs|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|ritong: apparently the psych did not work:)|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit:  Of course 4@H hasn't made yet|pg||
nt|ritong: although...|pg||
nt|kit:  And 5@D certainly won't make, so hard to argue with success.|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  If a raise to 3C is a genuine invitation, W was doubtless reluctant to relinquish control of the auction. 2D leaves opponents more room but keeps more control in the W hand, and also 2D might not be bid over.|pg||
pc|s9|nt|shuster:  I think they use 2NT as either a preemptive raise in clubs or GF 2-suiter|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  W has to pick a way to bet|pg||
nt|kit:  I don't know what the definitiion of the double of 2@D is, and maybe N-S didn't either.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|shuster:  http://usbf.org/docs/2017usbc/acblcards/AkerSimson.pdf|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|shuster:  Well, enough of a smokescreen to drive N/S into a doomed contract and a potential game swing|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  as precision is not a rare system worldwide, presumably any USA2 Team will know what a double of a Precision 2C-2D sequence is by the time le rideau se leve a Lyon|pg||
nt|shuster:  If North thought double showed diamonds, then he also thought South was cuebidding in support of diamonds.  Maybe South thought double was takeout and he was trying to get North to pick a major|pg||
nt|ritong: hi gandalf|pg||
nt|shuster:  So I guess Simson's 2@D call really did the trick here, getting N/S onto different pages in their notes.|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  lower than 3C, but far more scope for confusion that a raise, which sharpens focus for adversary|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Garner still thinking.|pg||
nt|shuster:  If I ever pulled that 2@D call, partner would still be doubling everything they bid.|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|pc|s5|pc|sA|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: I could have asked Zia about Garner's double, but I didn't want to bother him (even though he's dummy).|pg||
nt|ritong: wise|pg||
nt|marlowepi:  he is very shy and reticent anyway|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Now Simson thinking.|pg||
nt|ritong: having lost two relatively makeable games, he might be in biting mood|pg||
