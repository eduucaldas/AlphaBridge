nt|3for3:  Or Jeff might|pg||
nt|shuster:  the auction turned the screws on East.  3NT is gone, but West should have enough to raise to 5@C.  He might even cuebid along the way.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Brenner asks Aker about the 4@c bid, but of course I can't read the tiny tiny writing on the note :)|pg||

mb|4S!|nt|3for3:  Hm, might be another misunderstanding?  |pg||
nt|3for3:  Aker thinks 4@C is blacks?|pg||
nt|shuster:  4@S would be fine on a heart lead.  I think a diamond would beat it.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Now I have read the note - I think there's a misunderstanding here - Aker wrote that 4@c is 5+-5+ clubs & spades|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Now Simson is writing a note, perhaps having been woken up by the 4@s bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|shuster:  East will probably realize his error when 4@S comes back to him.  One great effect of screens is that you can sometimes recover from a misbid by realizing it.  Or not.|pg||
nt|rduran1216:  I don't think E has any right to move over 4S|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Aker: "so 4@c was clubs and spades and 4@s was forward going?" Simson: "yes - that's our agreement"|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hA|pc|h9|pc|h5|pg||
nt|shuster:  The hand would be complex with 4-2 spades even with 1-1 clubs, so I think declarer will probably play for 3-3 spades.  He'll still need to navigate the club suit.|pg||

nt|shuster:  perhaps the director can look into that, as the same board being fouled twice in one day is a good indication that board is defective.|pg||
