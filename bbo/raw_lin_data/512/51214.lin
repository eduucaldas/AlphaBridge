nt|vugraphzfe: various|pg||
nt|ritong: west's hand is a simple raise in my book|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|chip:  playing light openings suspect Kit  will agree.|pg||
nt|ritong: but east should try(or even blast 4@s facing a constructive raise)|pg||
mb|p|nt|fuquay:  Although the spots are good|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Zia:  these guys get the cards on every hand; I told them I wanted to sit EW but they wouldn't let me.  Bridge is much more fun when you have the cards|pg||
nt|chip:  mostly a question of bringing hearts into the picture (could be much better if 9 hearts) or to not give away info.|pg||

nt|ritong: i was expecting a @s to the A because of the @s7|pg||
nt|ritong: @s A then @s 10 picks up Q9xx or Q8xx|pg||

nt|chip:  Of course NS don't know anything about E hand (advantage of not telling in the bidding).|pg||
nt|ritong: they have a small indication when opener did not try for NTs  he has not a balanced hand|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h6|pc|h5|pc|h9|pg||
nt|chip:  EW had an accident at the other table and got to 6S. NS preemted a bit in D, and EW lost blackwood, then miss guessed to bid slam (lots of wasted values).|pg||
pc|sA|nt|fuquay:  Hamman --- Bramley bid a slam off two aces on Board 23 to tighten up the match|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: well garner has seeen zia's overcalls previously|pg||
nt|chip:  S loves to bid over 1N at this Vul, so N had to worry about a rather light hand.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: Zia is going through his methods over this 2@D, as they are not a praticed partnership|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|vugraphzfe: on seeing dummy Zia comments "we could play 3NT"   Garner asked what Zia would have bid with Garner's hand.  "your bidding is perfect"|pg||

nt|chip:  fraction comes from carryover from the RR match between the two teams.|pg||
mb|1N!|an|10-12|nt|chip:  Hamman had a carryover of 8.67. With out that the match would be even closer.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: this is a good 10-12 NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|chip:  yes, might well upgrade to 1D. But perhaps thinks it is good to make a bid that won't be made at the other table to get a swing.|pg||

pc|dK|pc|d3|pc|d8|pc|dA|pg||
nt|chip:  club or A and a trump best. spade (won't be led) worst.. Though this lead not so great either.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfe: 8 of diamonds here is suit preference|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c7|nt|chip:  Other table might start 1D-P-1S-2H. Then a spade lead could let 4H make. That combination still probably not enough for Gupta: 300 here and 420 at the other table is only 12 So still lose by .67. Of course the BBO score is not official.|pg||

pc|h5|pc|hQ|pc|h8|nt|chip:  other table in 4H on same lead. first two tricks the same and trump played at the other table. So likely a swing to Gupta, but not enough. Hamman will win by roughtly their carryover of 8.67.|pg||

nt|herbie22:  however, I might not be being fair...if club ace was on, defense would have to cash the diamond, so it was unclear|pg||
