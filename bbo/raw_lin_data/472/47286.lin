mb|1C|mb|d|nt|athene: the old-fashioned wisdom was to redouble with the north hand just to show strength|pg||
nt|vugraphzmr: The Gold Cup is the most prestigious knockout tournament in the calendar in Great Britain|pg||
nt|athene: but when partner has opened 1@C especially, it's almost pointless trying to look for a penalty|pg||
mb|r|mb|1D|mb|1H|nt|athene: the opponents will almost certainly have somewhere to play at the 1-level|pg||
nt|athene: and if you angle all your bidding towards that end, it can make it a lot harder to bid your own hands constructively|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|ritong: i totally agree|pg||
nt|athene: many top pairs now just try to "ignore the double" and use the extra space to bid their own hands effectively|pg||
mb|3C|nt|ritong: although 2@c is a little beyond me, here|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes using transfers|pg||
nt|ritong: probably 1@h undersaid " long @cs"|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|ritong: south would pass over 1@d with a flat hand|pg||
