nt|roswolf:  thanks to our great operator =well done|pg||
nt|paulg:  only 3 imps to England, but another missed opportunity for Scotland|pg||
nt|vugraphzht: The second stanza starts at 21.25 UK time.|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  that is in 25 minutes, so a short time for the Scots to regroup |pg||
nt|roswolf:  thanks too to paul for his company and perceptive comments i hope you all enjoyed the show|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|roswolf:  restart for the second half will be in approx 20 mins time|pg||
mb|2S|nt|paulg:  I must admit that I'd double with the South hand, five hearts to the ace is sufficient for me|pg||
nt|roswolf:  i would double as north now|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|paulg:  although it's no surprise that Danny Kane has higher standards than me|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|paulg:  Kane has a great hand for a takeout double, unfortunately it would probably be penalty|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|paulg:  but it's had the desired effect of pushing them higher|pg||
