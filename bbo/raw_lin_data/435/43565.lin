mb|p|mb|p|nt|pjs_ch:  almost, but in second seat and with clubs the preemptive value is little, so perhaps ?|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  this contract gets very awkward because the club suit in declarer's hand will be cut off |pg||

nt|pjs_ch:  ah - he does|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pjs_ch:  making thisis not impossible as the heart position may show up as he ruffs diamonds|pg||

pc|hA|pc|c5|nt|pjs_ch:  very hard not do this|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|pg||

nt|pjs_ch:  if the defence had cashed two spade first - that line would not have been available.|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  interesting question as to which !AK to lead first|pg||

nt|pjs_ch:  B10|pg||
mb|1H|nt|pjs_ch:  another potential swing here|pg||
mb|d|mb|2H|nt|pjs_ch:  and the bidding started the same way in theother room but there it was 5-card majors|pg||

mb|p|pc|hK|nt|pjs_ch:  since 5@Hx made (on a slightly unfortunate lead) this can only be better for WALES|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  but making this won't be easy|pg||
pc|s4|pc|h4|pc|h6|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  he needs tricks on both diamonds and clubs and neither will give him good news|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  at least the spades are breaking 3-2|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  if he gets out for just -200 then WALES  will double their lead to 24 imps|pg||

pc|d4|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  he might just ignore his partner's signal here for club and play a passive heart|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  this is the last board, restart time is 25 past the hour|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  and there will be a second 16-board stanza|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  we lack the results on B1 and B2 at this table so although the total shows WALES ahead by 12|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  the truth may be different from that|pg||
mc|9|nt|pjs_ch:  of course Pownall here is thinking how easily they would have beaten 5@H and what a bundle|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  of imps he is going to lose on this board|pg||

nt|pjs_ch:  Welcome everyone to match 1 of the second weekend of the 2016 Camrose series|pg||

pc|c3|pc|c8|pc|c4|pc|d6|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  all players have long experience and were heavily involved with 5 years ago this same match|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  happened and then WALES wnet on to collect the Camrose trophy for the first time ever|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  3N here looked an easy contract until the clubs turn out to break 4-1 and now there are only 7 top tricks and two more are needed|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  Mike Tedd needs one from both diamonds and spades and the defence can counter|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  that only if they attack spades in time|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  the @H3 discard will at least guide Paul Denning away from that suit|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  and it does mean most of North's points will be accounted for - he can't have much|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  more than 8  hcp to bid only 1N and not bid at the 2-level|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  it all comes down to working out who has the @SQ|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  but the Denning-Thomas system card says reverse attitude on discards which means ?? that the @H3 encourages hearts|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  WALES have just registered 8 imps on board 11 where Plackett stole the contract in 3@S-2|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  while Paul played carefully here to make 4@H|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  somethign seems stuck here :(|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  on this hand at the other tables NS made 3N for +600 but by SOuth|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  in which case a diamond lead is likely and declarer end up giving up a club  to the safe hand and |pg||

mb|1S|nt|pjs_ch:  here's a tricky one but successfully negotiated in the other room|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|pjs_ch:  they bid a totally natural (when do we say that?) 1@S-5@D-6@D|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pjs_ch:  seems an odd chocie to make, bidding 3N with a 0283 shape and never rebidding the diamond suit|pg||

mb|1S|nt|pjs_ch:  England-Scotland might emerge when we move onto board 1 after this one|pg||
mb|3H|nt|pjs_ch:  four card majors rear their head here - WBU has 3 pairs playing that style|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  and I think WALES has none|pg||
mb|3S|nt|pjs_ch:  the 3@H here from John is limited, in that a 2@S bid would cover a good raise|pg||

mb|4H|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pjs_ch:  the 3@S bid here is very wide ranging and this version might be a disappointment to declarer who surely is bidding to make|pg||
