nt|ahollan2: rewording because of lots of feedback    i meant world class bidding to penalize  [not the bidding that got ew into trouble]|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfd: last deal of this 1st quarter.  We will start shortly after the other table finishes this set.  They are a couple of bds behind this table|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfd: I forgot to change the profile name; did so on bd 1.  Kate will be here this evening|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@C = 2+@C //  2@C = FG, a) BAL  b) @C  |pg||
nt|stc:  2@c by E may avoid the deadly @c lead|pg||
nt|stc:  but even so, they are not home|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@d covers a few hands // 2@H aks // 2@S = weak nt, some worthless doubleton|pg||
nt|stc:  J@d would bea  VERY friendly lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Madala tells Brog he (Madala) can have any suit, but not 5 card suit.  When a diamond is led, Madala says "that one I have"|pg||

nt|pilogen:  North can switch to a small @c and still beat it|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
