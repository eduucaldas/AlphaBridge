nt|mrdct:  a tradition at youth week is immediately after the teams event, the winners play a 4-board sudden death playoff against a team of experts for the Cliff Wake Trophy|pg||
nt|mrdct:  scoring was switched to BAM a couple of years ago|pg||
nt|mrdct:  congratulation to the Edgtton Team who are the 2016 Australian Youth Teams Champions|pg||
nt|mrdct:  and congratulations also to runners up - Cooper who put up a good fight|pg||
nt|mrdct:  the origin of the "Cliff Wake" name for the trophy was a hand-writing misinterpretation for a country congress where the "Griff Ware" team appeared on the entry list as "Cliff Wake"|pg||
nt|mrdct:  for Cliff Wake we have Nye Griffiths and Andy Hung|pg||
nt|mrdct:  Nye was on last year's Australian Open Team|pg||
nt|mrdct:  Andy has won multiple national open titles and is the bulletin editor at this event|pg||
nt|mrdct:  part of the tradition is the winners trophy is engraved with all players' names misspelt; usually humourously|pg||
nt|mrdct:  i'm not sure who we have in the other room - i suspect it might be James Coutts from NZ who is helping out at these championships|pg||
nt|mrdct:  the tension is killing me - i hope we haven't got a technical problem|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: we'll get going in a minute or two|pg||
nt|mrdct:  I'm told the other Cliff Wake pairs is James Coutts and rising star from NZ, Matty Brown|pg||
nt|mrdct:  max henbest is from melbourne and adam edgtton is from sydney|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|mrdct:  a @d partscore for EW here is about all that makes|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mrdct:  but in BAM scoring some street away from minor suit contracts|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mrdct:  looks like we lose a @s and 2@c|pg||
nt|mrdct:  potentially 3@c|pg||
nt|mrdct:  at the other table we have James Coutts and Matty Brown for Cliff Wake|pg||
nt|mrdct:  overtricks are obviously crucial|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: hung in deep thought|pg||
nt|mrdct:  with the @s87 andy might play for a miracle @S109 tight in north|pg||

pc|s7|nt|mrdct:  one thing about BAM is it's very slow as every trick is vital|pg||

nt|mrdct:  undo that comment|pg||
nt|mrdct:  coldn't avoid the 3rd @c loser once def started playing trumps|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s2|nt|mrdct:  on a good day when you bid 4@h with a hand like this the opps feel they are being robbed and bid 4@s|pg||
nt|mrdct:  intereting position - whilst he has a free finesse, he needs to be in dummy to take @d hook|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mrdct:  so he'll probably rise A|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s3|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d8|pc|d6|pc|dT|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|c5|pg||
nt|mrdct:  the challenge for the def now is to keep declarer away from dummy to take a @s hook|pg||
nt|mrdct:  11 tricks now on the @s finesse|pg||

nt|mrdct:  nice play, gets rid of the @dK to clear the decks to get to dummy|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|mrdct:  9 top tricks and the @hA onside for 10 so should be a push|pg||
nt|mrdct:  another tradition with this event is that every table will have at least a dozen kibitzers. look out for the photos in tomorrow bulletin|pg||
nt|mrdct:  http://www.abfevents.com.au/events/ayc/2016/bulletins.asp|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d8|pc|dK|pg||
nt|mrdct:  i guess there is a danger of only making 9 here if you try to double hook @c and in the menatime opps set up a @d trick and have the @hA|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c8|pc|cJ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|mrdct:  @CK standard play here to look like he doesnt have the Q|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|hT|pc|d3|nt|mrdct:  north migh tbare his @cQ|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|s2|pc|h3|nt|mrdct:  assuming the finesse will be repeated at BAM|pg||
pc|d6|pc|h9|pg||
pc|s5|pc|h5|nt|mrdct:  if this is a tie - we go to one-board sudden death|pg||
nt|mrdct:  would've been quite a spectacular play for north to bare his @CQ|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hA|pc|h6|pc|h8|pg||
nt|mrdct:  another cute thing here is east can pitch a @h here and endplay north|pg||

mb|1C|nt|mrdct:  last board of the match now|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1H|mb|1S|mb|d|nt|mrdct:  i think this will get to 4@s|pg||
mb|1N|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mrdct:  but trumps sit poorly and @dK offside so some work to do|pg||
nt|mrdct:  north will make a belated @s raise now i think|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mrdct:  west migh tdbl at BAM|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct:  yep|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mrdct:  at IMPs you'd let it slide and not give away the trump position, but at BAM you need to be more ruthless|pg||
nt|mrdct:  youth week continues tomorrow with the Pairs Final and the Wednesday to Saturday is the selection trials for the 2016 U25 team|pg||
pc|h5|pc|c8|pc|cA|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|pc|hQ|pc|h2|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|pc|h7|pc|hK|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hT|pc|s2|pc|h4|pg||
nt|mrdct:  10-pairs have qualified for the selection trials.  they play a round-robin of 20-board matches scored against datums from another event|pg||
nt|mrdct:  top two pairs are on the team and then 3rd/4th playoff head-to-head for the final berth|pg||
nt|mrdct:  brd 29 was a push|pg||
nt|mrdct:  30 looks good for edgtton|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d5|pc|dQ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|mrdct:  trump looks clear now to cut down the ruffs|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|nt|mrdct:  so 4@sx-3|pg||
nt|mrdct:  although that could easily be replicated in the other room|pg||
nt|mrdct:  we'll see soon|pg||
nt|mrdct:  on board 30 in the other rrom EW are in 2@hx|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sT|pg||
nt|mrdct:  which can afford to go -2 but has chances to make|pg||
nt|mrdct:  so 30 will be a win for Edgtton|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|d8|pc|s9|pg||
pc|c2|pc|s5|pc|c3|pc|c4|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d7|pc|c6|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pc|dT|pc|s8|pg||
pc|c5|pc|d2|pc|cK|pc|c7|pg||
mc|8|nt|mrdct:  hnag on def didnt draw trumps|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: just one off|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: ill change it in a sec|pg||
nt|mrdct:  so gets out for -2 which might be good for Edgtton|pg||
nt|mrdct:  -1 or -2?|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: just one|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: doesn't matter anyway|pg||
nt|mrdct:  so def was butchered a tad there|pg||
nt|mrdct:  giving the Edgtton team an excellent chance to take the double|pg||
nt|mrdct:  likelt 2.5-1.5 win to Edgtton|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: it was -2 actually...|pg||
nt|mrdct:  *likely|pg||
nt|mrdct:  yeah that's what it looked like|pg||
nt|mrdct:  the two pairs on the Edgtton team would be heavy favourites to make the Australian Youth Team this year, but there are three other serious contenders so an exciting few days awaits|pg||
nt|mrdct:  thanks for watching everyone|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: they made 2Hx in thwe other room, so the trophy goes to Edgtton|pg||
nt|mrdct:  i know max has won this event before as the trophy is engraved with "Maxine Henwest"|pg||
