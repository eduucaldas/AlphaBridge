nt|medwards:  Looks like an action hand|pg||
mb|1H|nt|Schafer:  3@d or 4@d?|pg||
nt|Schafer:  Prob 3 R v W at IMPs|pg||
nt|ahollan2: 1@H=10-15|pg||
mb|2D|mb|3C|nt|Schafer:  Or 2@d|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|meargent:  either 2 or 3 @Ds seem fine|pg||
nt|kareno: Hi Joey :)|pg||
nt|Schafer:  It looks like a preempt to me|pg||
nt|meargent:  :)|pg||
nt|kareno: Walt :)|pg||
nt|Schafer:  Hello|pg||
nt|medwards:  I might consider biding three diamonds with that hand over one heart|pg||
nt|kareno: Lots of distribution |pg||
nt|meargent:  too much defence not solid enough suit|pg||
nt|medwards:  I agree not perfect but...|pg||
nt|Schafer:  Anyway, they are at 3@s which looks to be down 1 and nothing higher is making|pg||
nt|meargent:  3 is fine 4 aint|pg||
nt|Schafer:  So Passing is best here|pg||
mb|4D|mb|5C|nt|kareno: I think at adverse it is more of a preempt.  Partner would expect more in transferable values.|pg||
nt|meargent:  3@Ss forcing|pg||
nt|medwards:  Yes pass before the doubling starts|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: trying to keep the bids coming in twos so the players don't hear anything behind screens|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Schafer:  3@c is a GF.  How can 3@s be forcing when the opponents are in a GF?|pg||
pc|d9|nt|kareno: That's perfect, Ben!!|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dK|pc|c3|pg||
nt|Schafer:  I don't think he wanted 3@s to be forcing|pg||
nt|kareno: I agree - it is not forcing, but very invitational|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Schafer:  he can make this Dbl-Dummy|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c5|pc|c8|pg||
nt|meargent:  me i would bid 4@Ss if 3@Ss wasn;t forcing|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c6|nt|Schafer:  Guess the @h and ruff out the @dA|pg||
nt|medwards:  Yes|pg||
pc|h4|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|Schafer:  You would bid 4@s w/ Norths hand over 3@c?|pg||
nt|kareno: He may well misguess the heart.|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h7|nt|Schafer:  That goes for 500 w/ perfect defense (and not hard to get it right0|pg||
nt|kareno: He's sniffing ... Stella could help him if she were there :)|pg||
nt|Schafer:  Meckstroth has been guessing well today|pg||
nt|meargent:  i would|pg||
nt|meargent:  bid 4@Ss and not be the least embaressed except thinking I was 2 strong|pg||
pc|hK|nt|kareno: With ace of hearts in addition to the known diamond suit, south may have bid 5@d|pg||

nt|kareno: How many hearts, vul?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|Schafer:  Rodwell in 4th seat so....|pg||
nt|Schafer:  Probably 2@h after the 1NT overcall|pg||

nt|kareno: Interestingly I play 'our system on after 1nt overcall'|pg||
mb|1N|mb|3H|nt|meargent:  VOILA|pg||

nt|kareno: If he can sneak a diamond... but south will climb on a diamond and cash the spade.|pg||

nt|Schafer:  Seems like the only shot to make it|pg||
nt|kareno: He has now got many ways to go down |pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: Jeff is playing the hand -- they turned the board around|pg||
nt|Schafer:  ok|pg||
nt|meargent:  @C finess only shot|pg||
nt|medwards:  So am I plus can not believe the duck looking at a set|pg||
nt|kareno: Can you make sure they turn the rest around or was it just this one board?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: it's just this board|pg||
nt|vugraphzfc: hopefully|pg||
nt|Schafer:  That's why Eric played the Jack, he thought the chance of the @dA being onside was Zero.  Not almost Zero but zero|pg||
nt|meargent:  S had east down in own hand so quacking the @D was suprising|pg||
nt|kareno: I'm sure you can check with them, Ben.|pg||

nt|kareno: Eleven tricks to start with in notrump|pg||
nt|Schafer:  Yes, I agree.  Rodwell will pick @s|pg||

nt|Schafer:  Not so clear|pg||
nt|meargent:  whatever slam is excellent|pg||

nt|eamongall: it will no doubt be similar contract in other room and same break |pg||

nt|Schafer:  Maybe North wants to give them a Fielder's Choice with 6@h|pg||
