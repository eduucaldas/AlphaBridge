mb|p|mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|nt|vugraphzfv: Hi John :)|pg||
mb|1H|mb|2S|mb|4H|mb|4S|nt|Schafer:  Looks like 4@sx is -300 and 5@h makes.|pg||
nt|Schafer:  So 4 IMPs riding on NS|pg||
nt|Schafer:  NS's decision here.|pg||
nt|Schafer:  Actually, 5@h can do down with a @D lead|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|Schafer:  5@D will make.  Ralph is smart, he's trying to plkay 5@c here instead of 5@h|pg||
nt|Schafer:  Hopefully Nick will be onboard and offer 5@d|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d4|nt|Schafer:  Even a @s lead allows a @D shoft so I don't think NS will make this|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d8|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|jgc:  Agreed, unlucky for Katz that the preemptor has a third @H|pg||
nt|Schafer:  Will Ralph take the @H finesse?  |pg||
nt|Schafer:  I think he knows what's up and will try @hA and a @h|pg||
nt|Schafer:  Neither work but...|pg||
nt|jgc:  I think he'll go A and another, hoping for no ruff|pg||
nt|EOK: n going minus in 5H (of course)|pg||
nt|jgc:  Besides even if @HK is with E, the @CK will be with W|pg||
nt|Schafer:  But @hKxx onside doesnt' work, the @sA can be off|pg||
nt|Schafer:  He can lose a ruff trying to avoid it|pg||
nt|Schafer:  It's hard to turn down the finesse here.|pg||

mb|1S|nt|3for3:  I am told they play "polish club", so 1@C can be clubs or strong|pg||
nt|ahollan2: 1@C = forcing, multi-purpose  a) BAL, 12-14  b) 5+@C, unbal, 16+  c) any 18+|pg||

pc|d4|nt|3for3:  This looks cold, even with the diamond ruff.  Had Weinstein opened 2@S, I suspect EW would be in 4@Sx|pg||
nt|3for3:  Jansman can't afford 2 @D ruffs, so cannot take finesse as cards lie|pg||

pc|h3|nt|ahollan2: east hand was much better in other room as declarer|pg||
nt|chip:  other table opened a strong club as W and got to 3S. This will go down 2 or 3, so a 2-3 more imps to Rosenthal|pg||
nt|Schafer:  If he plays the @HJ here and it wins he has 8 tricks|pg||
