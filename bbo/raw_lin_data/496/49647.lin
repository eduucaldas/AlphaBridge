nt|ahollan2: most signalling for meckwell is reverse: count, attitude, suit pref, smith    there are exceptions  but i only know about 1  [so far]|pg||
nt|odysseus69:  better not pick spade|pg||
nt|dburn:  the two is OK|pg||
nt|dburn:  if declarer ducks he loses a club ruff and if he wins he has no entry to the long spade after drawing trumps|pg||
nt|odysseus69:  you are right david - change your name to Gib|pg||
nt|dburn:  but the nine is fatal, since then North can be strip-squeezed|pg||
nt|dburn:  the contract was made at the other table, so this is a chance for Nickell|pg||

mb|p|nt|grebrof:  pass 2@h-X and then 3@h made no point in the bidding contest|pg||
mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|ahollan2: 2@H = 5+@S|pg||
mb|3C!|mb|p|nt|warrens:  Rodwell will find out about the 3 aces and @S support, will he find out that Meckstroth has 4 @C's?|pg||
nt|grebrof:  they really count Js in America :)|pg||
nt|ahollan2: they have changed rebid structure over 1@C-1@H   but obviously now 2@S = BAL 11-13|pg||
nt|ahollan2: i'm just not sure if it clarifies meck's @S length|pg||
nt|warrens:  I think he would upgrade without the J of @D's.  I don't know if he'd open 1@C without either red jack.  Al, do you think AKQJx, xx, x, KJxxx would merit 1@C?|pg||
nt|odysseus69:  am betting they reach 6 spades|pg||
nt|grebrof:  this reminds me of some 20 years ago, we played weak NT and my P opened 1nt with Qjx-QJx-QJx-QJx-QJxx- at some point you have to have a max for a minimum hand when holding 5-5 - but this might be their agreement. N had 14hp in my mind|pg||
nt|dburn:  easier to open 1@c when you have spades - @sx @hAKQJx @dxx @cKJxxx might open 1@h|pg||
nt|warrens:  what are the odds of 2-2 or stiff Q?  about 52%, I believe|pg||
nt|dburn:  a fraction more|pg||
nt|dburn:  but not a very large fraction|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|warrens:  so, it's just a borderline slam.  At this point, he'd like to be in it if they are at the other table|pg||
nt|grebrof:  2-2 48 - 3-1 about the same - stiff Q 12%? 60% something|pg||
nt|Wollies: ok|pg||
nt|dburn:  not sure what North knows - if partner could have @cAx it would be a better slam|pg||
nt|dburn:  2-2 40%, stiff queen 1/4 of 50%|pg||
nt|grebrof:  52.5% fdor stiff Q together with 2-2 tha balcony tells me|pg||
nt|ahollan2: i am sure that the upgrade to 1@C is based somewhat on the relay structure  which i wish i knew :(|pg||
nt|grebrof:  53.13% is the highest bidder @@thebalcony|pg||
nt|ahollan2: mentioned yesterday  philosophy seems to be    upgrade often, downgrade never|pg||
nt|Psyck:  Suitplay.exe says 53% for 5 @c tricks.|pg||
nt|Psyck:  .1304|pg||
mb|5N|mb|p|nt|odysseus69:  too many things for Meckstroth to show - despite poorb spades he will drive slam|pg||
nt|kareno: Pick a slam..|pg||
nt|dburn:  of course, if South had @hAx and @dAxx it would be a five-or-seven hand|pg||
nt|warrens:  4@C must have been a natural bid, so Meck knows there is a double fit|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|odysseus69:  so he knew about club suit|pg||
nt|grebrof:  I was asked today how many numbers does have "one or more an even number" from 1 to 1000 - a question in matematics - answer is 844 ((I did not figure it out))|pg||
nt|ahollan2: after 2@H  the ONLY bid i am sure about is  5N = pick-a-slam|pg||
nt|grebrof:  2 imps lost?|pg||
nt|Psyck:  Easier to write a software program than working out the math of that problem :)|pg||
nt|warrens:  N/S in 3NT on  27, going down on a @D lead, so another 6 imps to Nickell|pg||
nt|ahollan2:  27  [3@HS+]  schwartz in 3N north  lead @Dx|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ahollan2: or what warren said|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|kareno: They may lose a little but 6@c and 6@s are really the same contract with these cards.  They need the club suit.|pg||
