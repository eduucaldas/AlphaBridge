mb|1N|mb|3C|mb|d!|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: another undiscussed situation probably|pg||

nt|msipus: If Kiril put a DBL in 99% of times it is TO|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: yes of course, but the question is does Vesna come from the same school, and/or does she know what school kiril comes from|pg||
mb|p|nt|msipus: on this board she knows it is TO cause holding KJT @C :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3N rather pucjy facing a passed hand, but N has shown 3-level values, and she is uncomfortable either passing or putting all eggs in the spade basket, and wants to do something ...|pg||

pc|s4|nt|msipus: interesting lead from W|pg||

nt|marlowepi: conditions|pg||

nt|marlowepi: table  (or 7132) and  the whole suit can be run if E can get in., and also increases the chance that a club will yield the ninth trick|pg||
nt|msipus: I like Kirils DBL here especially if 1nt could be 17 Hcp|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes of course X is clearly the correct technical bid. But in a context of no discussion/substitution/first-time partnership, it is sometimes necessary to make a second-best call in ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: order to avoid a potential dissaster. They have both been doing that in this match, in fact|pg||
nt|marlowepi: though not always (e.g. the 2N bid by N when slam was played in partial)|pg||
nt|msipus: I agree passive bidding in hard situations are the best option :)|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|marlowepi: goig back to the opening lead, one understands the lack of a club lead. But a spade but be most pyers' last choice|pg||
pc|s6|nt|msipus: so PASS is always a good option where you dont know how will your p understand you and especially if you dont expect a game here|pg||

mb|p|nt|marlowepi: sometimes the straightforward obvious bid when you have agreements is very dangerous when you dont|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2D!|nt|msipus: Kiril will surely go to slum here |pg||
nt|msipus: he can hope just N will not pass his GF|pg||
nt|marlowepi: A useful tip for new partnerships: aside from deciding what conventions you will play, very early on you should establish a set of guidelines for making  bids, and interpretations ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: of bids, when you are in undiscussed territory and you beleive that both of you know that|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|msipus: :)|pg||
nt|msipus: Marshall look|pg||
pc|d3|nt|marlowepi: well here is a perfect example of a case where a player makes a bid which is correct in his only system but about as dngerous as a bid can be|pg||
nt|msipus: two times in 9boards|pg||
nt|msipus: so who is guilty now Marshall :)|pg||

nt|marlowepi: 4th-suit GF is a much more common agreement than XYZ, so it was maybe a more practical and safer choice than 2D intended as GF|pg||
nt|msipus: Kiril plays always XYZ|pg||
nt|marlowepi: what he always plays isnt important in the current situation|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d6|pc|d9|pg||
nt|msipus: so this board is very expensivefor NS|pg||
nt|msipus: but look if you have5minute to agree with your partner what should you agree|pg||
nt|msipus: I always agree what CB we play|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2C was a safer bid. If his partner thinks it is GF, great. If she also thinks they are playing XYZ, she will bid 2D and then Kiril gets to bid again|pg||

nt|marlowepi: by the same token, S might have bid 3D here, as a sort of "safety play" in case Kiril was on the XYZ wavelegth. But  it is so irresistible to think "in the present context, partner ...|pg||
