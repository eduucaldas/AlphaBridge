nt|lady007:  they cannot play the same board because the swedish player MIGHT have seen it because he was late|pg||
nt|vugrapho1: but i cant vgr it :(|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Can't be the same when the board has been displayed on the internet.|pg||
nt|lady007:  as all the boards are on bbo|pg||
nt|lady007:  yes. so you can all take a  short break|pg||
nt|bebechira: they are playing brd1 ..reshuffled by TD at the moment|pg||
nt|lady007:  in the last European championships there was a misduplication and we had to play a replacement board. Our Estonian opponents opened 3@D white/red in 3rd seat, and it became completely impossible for us to bid to the lay down 6@S. |pg||
nt|lady007:  we took 800 instead. but without the opening it would have been super easy to bid the slam|pg||
nt|lady007:  so it was a really bad result|pg||
nt|lady007:  but at the other table there was a misunderstanding and they bid to their 7crd heart fit in 6@H instead of 62 spades in 6@S|pg||
nt|lady007:  1 down|pg||
nt|lady007:  nobody could see the board because it was not duplicated|pg||
nt|lady007:  so everyone congratulated us that we did so well to take 800 when there wasnt a slam|pg||
nt|vugrapho1: they play another board |pg||
nt|lady007:  good moment to get kicked out by my internet .... didnt miss much :)|pg||
nt|vugrapho1: because one player was late|pg||

nt|vugrapho1: hands were already on the web |pg||
nt|vugrapho1: i dont know, it was on the other table|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder if anyone is recording hand so that official record [lin file] will let us see replacement board|pg||
nt|lady007:  probably not|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So either Sylvan or Wrang was late. Odds are 60-40 for the former.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Joanna - is this a pre-dealt replacement or did players shuffle?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: TD shuffled.|pg||
nt|vugrapho1: TD|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems to me there should be contingency plan that helps preserve historical record :(|pg||

nt|lady007:  2@C is too high for them to continue the relay |pg||
nt|lady007:  so now they continue naturalish bidding|pg||
nt|lady007:  Nystrom is thinking if he should go for penalties|pg||
nt|lady007:  remember that he knows that partner has 2+ clubs|pg||
nt|lady007:  But he is red against white and a slam might be possible|pg||
nt|yuval10:  6NT seem like the best contract here, if N doesn't settle for penalty, that is|pg||
nt|lady007:  if there is a slam then 2@Cx will never win you enough|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|lady007:  This zz points are very special. If you assume west has the queen of clubs. Then south should have either AK of spades, @SA @DK for his 5 points|pg||
nt|lady007:  (or more of course)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: de wijs overcalled with west hand after  2@C-P-2@D-3@C   but over 6@D SOUTH  did not believe his own lead director  so @Sx away from King and 6@D made|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4S!|mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|nt|yuval10:  in the other table def. finds their @c ruff in trick 2 but appearently the contract was already doomed due to the 4-1 trump break|pg||
nt|lady007:  There are only 11 tricks in 6@D|pg||
nt|lady007:  because you cannot lead up to th queen of spades as you will suffer a club ruff|pg||
nt|lady007:  yes in NT you can make 12 because the king of spades in onside|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nyström may go for 6NT.|pg||
mb|5N!|mb|p|mb|6D|mb|p|nt|lady007:  Yes but this is wrong of course if partner has 2 clubs and 4 diamonds|pg||
nt|lady007:  he is hoping partner has king of spades|pg||
nt|lady007:  no|pg||
nt|lady007:  now he has to decide|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: any guess about alert of 4@S?|pg||
nt|lady007:  even queen of hearts he might have bid|pg||
nt|yuval10:  if he knows P has 2 @c's then he might've suspect a @c ruff is a possibility|pg||
nt|lady007:  there is no direct ruff|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not with North as declarer.|pg||
nt|lady007:  as he is the declarer|pg||
nt|lady007:  only problem is with 33 in the minors. 42 and you want to play 6@D for sure|pg||
nt|lady007:  the 2@C bid propelled them to the slam, otherwise I am sure they would not have bid it|pg||
nt|vugrapho1: He did not say anything about the alert (4@s) |pg||
nt|yuval10:  indeed but sometimes as you said you need to let W in with the K@s , just like here|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dT|pc|d3|nt|lady007:  because now north knows the queen of clubs is onside|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|lady007:  but its a bad slam and it will go down|pg||
nt|lady007:  I think 4@S is weaker than 4@D (non serious/serious not just with 3NT but also 4m)|pg||
nt|lady007:  but not 100% sure|pg||
nt|lady007:  or maybe just alert because its a cuebid|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|lady007:  there is no endplay in clubs because declarer cannot even take 1 club finesse|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lady007:  as east has 4 trumps and he will ruff|pg||
pc|d7|nt|lady007:  therefore the endplay is for the 11 tricks|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|lady007:  trick|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i hope the 1st explanation is right   i hadn't heard that possibility before of using 4@D/cue to differentiate serious/non-serious|pg||
nt|lady007:  I think it is quite common/usefull. I use to play that 4@D is weaker, but probably better the other way around|pg||
