nt|athene: they play transfer rebids perhaps|pg||
nt|athene: so 1nt rebid can be natural or clubs?|pg||
nt|mug: they did many moons ago|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mug: nothing on the card|pg||
nt|athene: if you play this, and drury, and ghestem and gazilli, you avoided ever being able to bid clubs naturally your whole career|pg||

pc|c8|pc|c4|pc|cK|pg||
nt|athene: playing on clubs gives you the advantage it will eventually establish another entry to dummy|pg||

mb|2S!|mb|3H!|nt|panja:  NS can make 12 tricks on @S guess......competition in @D@S for NS vs. @H@C for EW|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the hand is exception to Ed Manfield's rule that the 5-level belongs to the opponents  [so don't bid 5-over-5]|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ritong: i was typing " sneaky pass by hampson":)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S = @H & @C/@D|pg||
nt|panja:  all suits are not equal....so South's Diamonds will likely stay unattended|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Ghestem users learn about double fit right away|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Ghestem specifically shows all of the 2-suiters|pg||
mb|4D|nt|panja:  what does 3@H indicate?  |pg||

mb|3S!|an|michaels|nt|mug: E/W also have a big fit|pg||
nt|athene: par is 7@C/@Hx EW i guess|pg||
nt|mug: many pairs play 4@C/@D Leaping Michaels here|pg||
nt|mug: and 3@S either asking for a spade stop, or showing a giant two-suiter|pg||
mb|d|nt|mug: how high this gets may depend on whether Lall can bid diamonds|pg||
mb|4C!|an|p/c|nt|athene: if Forrester bids 4@H Lall may just keep his own counsel and bid 4@S|pg||
mb|4D|nt|mug: a tactical bid first from Forrester, concealing his heart fit|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|mug: now North is booked at least to the five-level|pg||
mb|5H|nt|athene: not quite sure what 4@C was up to - isn't there a danger it just got passed out with 4@H cold?|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: i suppose he reasoned that if west does have clubs, the hand is such a big double fit there will be more bidding|pg||
nt|mug: Robson would have doubled 4@D with diamonds, so Tony knows the double fit|pg||
nt|athene: but i am not wholly convinced|pg||
nt|mug: may well bid on, I feel|pg||
nt|athene: if west had been able to bid 4@C rather than 3@S, east would know what was going on right from the start|pg||
nt|mug: victory on these hands is not always to the most scientific|pg||
nt|vugraphc1: east thinking|pg||
nt|mug: Turkey losing to Kuwait is a bit of a shock|pg||
nt|mug: that rubber-stamps Monaco's passage|pg||
nt|mug: and USA are also safe|pg||
mb|6C|nt|mug: I think if Lall doesn't bid, KB will|pg||
mb|p|nt|mug: he hasn't shown his @DAQJx yet|pg||
nt|mug: Lall has made two free bids after his weak two, so the 6-6 is to be reckoned with|pg||
nt|vugraphc1: west holding 6@h|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|6S|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mug: wrong player bidding IMO, but I suppose the opponents bidding told him the double fit|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mug: let's see if he can make it|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c3|pc|c7|pg||
nt|athene: if you know west is at least 5-5, 6@D is better than 6@S, because you find out his shape and know to finesse spades|pg||
nt|athene: but in 6@S you can't very well investigate diamonds because you might lose a ruff|pg||
nt|athene: but over 6@H of course there is not so much option|pg||
nt|mug: @C3 from East is count|pg||
nt|athene: would east have bid so high with 2-4-2-5?|pg||
nt|mug: if he believes West to be 5-5, it's a toss-up which singleton he holds, isn't it?|pg||
nt|mug: and he can't test diamonds for obvious reasons|pg||
nt|mug: if they were 3-0 E-W would have taken a ruff|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cJ|pc|c4|pc|s5|pg||
nt|athene: yes, west equally likely to be 1525 or 2515, but east more likely 3415 than 2425 on the bidding|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s9|pc|sK|pc|s3|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s4|nt|mug: @SK, @S10 and think|pg||
nt|mug: just maybe he will place Forrester for a singleton for his high bidding|pg||
nt|mug: so play him for 3-4-1-5 rather than 2-4-2-5|pg||
nt|mug: as Bill says|pg||
nt|mug: last hand for me, by the way, thanks all|pg||
