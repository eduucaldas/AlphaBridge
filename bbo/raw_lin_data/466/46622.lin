pc|s7|pc|s3|nt|lokaty: 5@H is a good ac. but to win 4@S You need to guess @C which is not obvious.|pg||
nt|athene: north bid 5@H because he has a pure hand with 4 hearts where he might have only 3|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|athene: but this is sort of why it might be better to bid 3@H the first time, to avoid the "last guess"|pg||
nt|athene: but Larry Cohen's book has not been translated into Polish, i think :) they don't go in for this so much in my experience|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Then perhaps it would have been better to let partner decide if he bids 3@H, It's not obvious what he would do, but I think 5@H.|pg||
nt|athene: i guess 4@S would depend on guessing clubs right - helgemo *might* have picked the offside king on the bidding, but it's quite a tall order|pg||

nt|athene: another 5422 in the right range for 1NT, but this is so pure, with nothing in the doubletons....and 5 clubs 4 spades is likely to develop very easily anyway starting 1@C|pg||

mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: on a diamond lead declarer probably doesn't want to duck, for fear of a heart shift|pg||
nt|athene: then the defence would get 3 hearts set up to go with their diamond trick in the bag|pg||
nt|athene: against weaker players you can always hold up because they never switch, but that doesn't apply here :)|pg||
nt|athene: of course the same applies on a heart lead|pg||
nt|athene: don't duck; a diamond shift would be worrying|pg||
pc|h2|nt|MrAce:  I don't think he will duck any red lead but if he does, it is far from obvious to find the shift for defense|pg||

pc|d8|pc|d4|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|athene: some might be surprised at south's lead decision|pg||
nt|athene: a couple of factors there:-|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|athene: firstly, north didn't overcall 1@D over 1@C so he isn't going to have 5 decent diamonds|pg||
pc|d6|nt|athene: secondly, on this bidding, declarer's diamonds can easily be as good as (or better than) his hearts|pg||

nt|athene: ok, slightly surprising from east there - i would have expected him to carry on probing with 3@H to keep 3NT in the picture|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@D shows a limit raise. Helness didn't know about the strong clubs, so he bypassed 3NT.|pg||
nt|athene: admittedly, 4441 is not a good notrump shape|pg||
nt|MrAce:  I expected the same auction William suggested|pg||
nt|athene: but still, 9 tricks is so much easier than 11|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But the problem is that if he bids 3@H, Helgemo will not bid 3NT without something in spades. Perhaps he can bid 3@S if they have that agreement.|pg||
nt|MrAce:  11 trick is much harder when pd has values in your stiff suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But what if he has spade values and nothing in clubs?|pg||
nt|athene: yes but even 1@D-2@D;3@C-3@D;3@H-3@S; now 3NT from east doesn not look comfortable knowing the lead is coming through partner's clubs|pg||
nt|MrAce:  Helgemo would bid 3 NT with this holding|pg||
nt|MrAce:  xxx vs xx(x) is more than enough to play 3 NT|pg||
nt|athene: it might look as though you have 3 sure major-suit losers in 5@D|pg||
nt|athene: but declarer would, if he picked the cards, have the option of leading a small heart towards dummy|pg||
nt|athene: then if south goes in with the king, two spades go away from dummy on the @HAQ|pg||
nt|athene: the trouble is, declarer only has a 4-4 trump fit, so even if he could do all that, he wouldn't have enough trumps to ruff all his losers, after drawing trumps|pg||
nt|MrAce:  Can EW make 4@S on a 4-3 fit?|pg||
nt|athene: the other option in 5@D is to play on spades and try to use east's long spade to discard a heart from west|pg||
nt|MrAce:  I don't think they can bid it now but...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Do we know what 3@C is? |pg||
nt|athene: with the @S10 falling, you can sort of do that, but you are still short of a trump, aren't you?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Other than extra values?|pg||

mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h5|nt|athene: ok well that makes life easier|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 3NT was indeed the contract at the other table on 6. 1 overtrick and 1 IMP to Poland.|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1S|nt|athene: but even when diamonds are 5-2 they don't always find the ruff|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|athene: or they might be blocked|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|MrAce:  but TD can change the making 5@D at this table |pg||
nt|athene: against that, sometimes you make 10 in NT...it's close|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But we believe that there is a ruling pending from this table. Possible missing alert. We shall see.|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|MrAce:  or did he decide already?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I doubt it.|pg||
nt|MrAce:  ok|pg||
nt|athene: 3-3 diamonds very useful here|pg||
pc|h4|nt|Walddk2: EW lead 3rd and 5th against both suit and notrump.|pg||
nt|athene: this is interesting... if he wants to preserve a sure entry to hand he must rise with the @HA|pg||
nt|athene: even assuming the diamonds come in, that still only gives him 8 sure tricks, but west can get endplayed somehow|pg||
nt|athene: playing low in dummy looks better|pg||
nt|athene: mainly because you want to get rid of east's heart honour|pg||
nt|athene: so he can't ever get in|pg||
nt|Walddk2: @H4 could be from 5 if Helgemos has QJ764(2).|pg||
nt|Walddk2: *Helgemo|pg||
nt|athene: yes, of course if helgemo led from QJxx, playing low wins immediately|pg||
nt|athene: he isn't going to have more than four hearts for a 1@C opener though|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But West can hardly have 5 hearts when he opens 1@C.|pg||
nt|MrAce:  in order to endplay W he may need to play low now, wins if the lead is from QJxx as well. He is just not sure yet how to create an entry to hand after setting diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: i think playing low in dummy is right|pg||
pc|hA|nt|athene: because since you need to endplay west anyway for the 9th trick, you can use that as your entry to the diamonds|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Not easy to see at the table.|pg||
nt|MrAce:  Helgemo will find it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Any bets?|pg||
nt|athene: maybe Helgemo is considering playing the @HQ|pg||
nt|athene: but he can be fairly sure which big cards declarer has, so the @HQ does not really gain over the diamond|pg||
nt|Walddk2: There is one more hurdle if he really finds it. He must unblock @HQ later.|pg||
nt|MrAce:  if he knows the count of @Ds, @D back now can not cost|pg||
nt|athene: the problem with this line is that declarer needs diamonds to break 3-3 anyway|pg||
nt|athene: and if they are 3-3, that means west always has a safe exit card in the third diamond|pg||
nt|MrAce:  if he believes declarer has 6@D, he has to play E for @HK or @C K|pg||
nt|athene: i don't think declarer would bid 3NT without both those kings, surely?|pg||
nt|athene: if he had a weakish hand with six diamonds it looks much more natural to bid 3@D over 2NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Helgemo is a pro, so he should find it I am told :)  Oh, well ...|pg||
nt|athene: also as a kibitzer points out, east is surely going to give honest count in diamonds here|pg||
nt|athene: since he knows his partner will have a critical decision and needs all the help he can get|pg||

pc|d3|nt|athene: Helgemo did have one thing to go on - declarer took quite a while to rise with the @HA at trick 1|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Can spare a heart now.|pg||
nt|athene: if he just had say @HKxxx in hand, it would be much more clearcut to rise|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Then unblock the queen when @HK is cashed.|pg||
nt|athene: when he takes a long time it is surely because his hearts are worth a lot more if he plays low in dummy|pg||
nt|MrAce:  T1 hesitation of declarer does not mean much though, it is proper to take time to let 3rd player plan the defense|pg||
pc|c9|pc|s8|nt|athene: i think it was a longer-than-usual pause for this declarer|pg||
nt|athene: but hard to be sure of course just looking at VG|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: @C9 was probably an error. Now Helgemo can be endplayed instead.|pg||
nt|MrAce:  One of the topics that I seen in BW being discussed, and most top players complain about fast T1 play by declarers.|pg||
nt|athene: now declarer can exit a club|pg||
nt|athene: and if helgemo plays the @HQ you duck|pg||
nt|athene: was very, very hard for the defence - they have to keep fluidity in hearts and clubs|pg||
nt|athene: to make sure east can get the lead|pg||

nt|athene: north probably doesn't have to be exactly 44 in the majors for that auction, though - maybe some hands with more length|pg||
nt|MrAce:  ok thanks|pg||
mb|d|mb|1S|an|3 cards|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|2D|nt|Walddk2: Going back to board 11 for a minute. 5@C can't make on a spade lead when trumps are 2-0.|pg||
mb|2S|mb|3H|nt|athene: this is weird|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: east didn't want to bid 2@H over 1@S, but he wants to bid 3@H over 2@S|pg||
nt|MrAce:  2@S was probably bid to desable 2@H by East|pg||
mb|p|nt|MrAce:  disable*|pg||
nt|athene: i think south would double 3@H at MP for one off|pg||
pc|h6|nt|athene: if you were making 2@S it's a full board swing to double 3@H one down|pg||
pc|hK|nt|athene: east is lucky to escape double here|pg||
nt|MrAce:  that's the thing, he is not sure they are making 2@S|pg||
nt|athene: when i said "south would double at MP for one off" i didn't mean 3@H *IS* going only one down :)|pg||
nt|MrAce:  assuming he knows N has only 3 card @S|pg||
nt|athene: i meant, south might expect it to go one down, and hence, double at MP, but not at imps|pg||
nt|MrAce:  i am talking about MP too |pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h2|pg||
nt|athene: north having only 3 spades makes defensive prospects much brighter of course|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|pc|dK|nt|MrAce:  can be too close if we exchange @C and @H J|pg||

pc|h4|pc|h7|pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|MrAce:  but I got your point, you have to defend your values at MP |pg||

nt|MrAce:  all I know is, do not DBL GIB in similar auctions regardless of scoring :) |pg||

pc|s3|pc|s9|nt|athene: not if your partner is GIB|pg||

nt|MrAce:  yes|pg||
nt|athene: he often gets excited when you double opponents|pg||

pc|dJ|nt|athene: 1@D opener would maybe lead to 1@D 1@S; 2@C - 2@S pass|pg||
nt|athene: but even there west has to use the soft pedal|pg||
nt|athene: if you play weak jump shifts then 2@S on that auction is constructive|pg||
