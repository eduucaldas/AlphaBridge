nt|roswolf:  1@H was showing spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzem: More problems - had records were wrong :(|pg||
nt|mdgraham:  at a guess, 1@h=spades, 1N=18-19 not necesarily balanced, 2@D either general FG or enquiry|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|roswolf:  i think 1nt just denied 3 spades|pg||
nt|roswolf:  2@D may have been a puppet bid to bail out ultimately in 2@S|pg||
nt|roswolf:  east knew where he wanted to play:)|pg||

mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham:  had a comment that S might pass the 12-count, but it looks like a normal, if light, opener. And if you read The Bridge World, you see a lot of flat 11's opened|pg||
nt|roswolf:  5@c seems a lot here|pg||
nt|roswolf:  north should double but he may bid on because of the colors|pg||
