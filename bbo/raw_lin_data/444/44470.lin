pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: 1N-2@S = Size Ask  so that would deny 4M|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h9|pg||
nt|ahollan1: looks like 29 will be a push    with defense unable to defeat 4@S at either table|pg||
nt|aardv:  on board 29, you right-side the contract by playing with Kx exposed to the lead, so they won't cash @HA first|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the other match both tables play  29 in 5@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with 4 to play   Allfrey leads Gidman by 5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: script writers like having close matches|pg||
nt|aardv:  meanwhile, 3NT is sure to make here, declarer sets up his heart tricks, so he can't lose three clubs|pg||
pc|c3|nt|aardv:  a small club now is the only possibility|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ahollan1: reminder to audience  this is 1st year where  IF  the unbeaten team loses in the semi-finals, they do NOT get 2nd chance in this otherwise Double Elimination event|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think that is an unfortunate change|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm sure it has to do with the schedule for finals|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but still|pg||
nt|aardv:  they can play club club, but west is known not to have @HAK and @CAQxx, so declarer can't go wrong|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in previous years - and still in the finals - the unbeaten team had option of extra 8 boards if trailing after 32 boards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Roland clarifies  that option only available ONCE|pg||
nt|ahollan1: which makes sense because they had their 1 loss after 32 boards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: still good recommendation from spec   in semi-finals, perhaps there should be a "carryover" for being undefeated|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c9|pc|cA|nt|ahollan1: i suppose if that is used to win semi-final, then they have no 2nd chance in final|pg||

mb|1C!|nt|ahollan1: 1@C = forcing  a) BAL, 11-13  b) any 17+|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1H!|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: as we've been discussing  NO EXTRA BOARDS in semi-final this year|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@H = 8+ hcp, 4+@S, not 6+M FG  [2M-1] |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C = art FG|pg||
mb|3C!|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i think 2@H would have also established game force while showing 5+@H|pg||
nt|aardv:  6NT is a not unlikely contract, might have chances in more than one suit|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i don't know the follow-ups in context of the overcall when hanlon already guarantees 5+@S|pg||
mb|4C|nt|aardv:  the entries are a bit awkward, but it's hard to learn exactly what the combination chances are in the auction|pg||

nt|ahollan1: crouch-zorlu already past 5@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: finals scheduled to start in 80 minutes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2 to play in other match  Allfrey leads Gidman by 3|pg||
nt|aardv:  this seems like a straight choice - if you rise ace you need the clubs to come in.  if you don't, you need either black suit, but no spade ruff|pg||
nt|aardv:  i think there are only 12 tricks in spades on a passive lead|pg||
