pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: haven't talked about it in long time   "frozen suit" is one where the side that leads the suit takes one LESS trick than if the opponents lead the suit|pg||
nt|aardv:  technically declarer can always take three tricks in clubs.  if he can see through the backs.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: backward finesse only seen in literature   never [well, hardly ever] in real play|pg||
nt|marlowepi: doesnt need to touch the suit thanks to the hearts|pg||

nt|aardv:  heather dhondy played one against me last year|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ahollan1: world champions qualify under "hardly ever"|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d8|nt|marlowepi: actually a bit more common than you suggest, but depends on declarer being able to count opp's points so usually a function of the auction  ...  but then so many other things in ...|pg||

pc|h5|pc|h9|nt|aardv:  in practice, @CJ won't be covered when @C10 is in the right place, unless the defence knows that declarer knows where the queen is|pg||

nt|aardv:  i take that back: this is indeed Mike's system, modified by agreement|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|marlowepi: yes that is what i was trying to suggest|pg||
mb|d|nt|aardv:  and that was a good hand for the system, since 4@S was much more challenging with the bad break|pg||
nt|ahollan1: assuming Gold really made the system bid :)|pg||
nt|aardv:  4@S came down to the heart guess|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|ahollan1: so RDBL just good hand for original pass|pg||
nt|marlowepi: when it ain't your day, nothing goes your way|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Snapdragon DBL = LHO opens, partner overcalls, RHO shows 3rd suit   then  DBL = length in 4th suit and [at least] tolerance for partner's suit|pg||

nt|marlowepi: thanks all :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: impressive win|pg||
nt|aardv:  that's a first win in this event for gold and bell - well done|pg||
nt|aardv:  thank you everyone|pg||
nt|aardv:  for anyone who can't tear themselves away: there was a suit combination earlier, J9652 opposite K83 for three tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzem: We're off to the champagne reception |pg||
nt|aardv:  if the suit is 3-2, you want to finesse against two of the honours.  and you want both finesses to be against he same hand, so you lose only to the wrong HH doubleton. (and not to the wrong H4 or H7, which you would if you finessed against both)|pg||
nt|aardv:  so the obvious line is small to the 8, then small to the king|pg||
nt|aardv:  but running the 9 on the first round is just as good against 3-2 breaks|pg||
nt|vugraphzem: Cheerio|pg||
nt|aardv:  and when RHO has singleton Q or A, running the 9 is better|pg||
nt|aardv:  enjoy the champagne|pg||
