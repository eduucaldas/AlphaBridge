mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|nt|stigw: With the 2 cl being natural GF, North clearly had extras enough to invite. At the other table probably more doubtful.|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dQ|nt|stigw: There you are, and nothing seems to could defeat this (even if cl are 4-1 and H ace wrong).|pg||
nt|Chick: a little care is needed here ... he may have to ruff 2 spades (not in this case, but he'll worry) and thus needs to keep entries|pg||
nt|Chick: he needs a spade to pitch the 3rd heart|pg||
nt|stigw: Not so easy to top the sp-suit, so we hold our breath.|pg||
nt|stigw: If Black can "signal length" in sp, declarer has something to contemplate.|pg||
nt|stigw: 3 times sp from start with a ruff will end all his problems, but its not obvious.|pg||
nt|Chick: finessing spades is a 50% play.  3-3 spades or the Q fall is 52%|pg||
