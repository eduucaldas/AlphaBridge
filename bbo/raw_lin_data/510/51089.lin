mb|p|mb|p|nt|affe82:  needed @hx2 and @c switch from e I think to threaten. Then she would still make if playing @s s for what I think is percentage|pg||

pc|d2|pg||
nt|affe82:  if not in 4@s, 5@s - the @d void in e's hand might trip some pairs up though|pg||

nt|affe82:  on @cQ I was expecting|pg||

mb|2S!|nt|pjs_ch:  B2|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  this opening shows spades and a minor|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  it is hard not to imagien ending in 3N, but Fil should double first just in case partner has something useful|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|pjs_ch:  2N here is the start of a weak sequenceto 3@H|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pjs_ch:  the doubler would often bid 3N here with 20 hcp, so there are a few to spare here|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cT|nt|pjs_ch:  it's going to be hard work despite 26 hcp as there aren't the entries ot lead up to the clubs and diamonds|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c8|pg||

pc|c7|pc|c5|pc|c2|pc|cQ|pg||

nt|affe82:  was more interesting than Yvonne is letting on, at least for decl!|pg||
mb|3H!|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|bt:  a good sac was found at the other table|pg||
nt|bt:  repeated trump leads might have beaten this|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s7|nt|bt:  now, trump to dummy, spade ruff, club ruff, spade ruff, heart to tummy and another spade ruff would have been enough|pg||
nt|bt:  but declarer didnt win in dummy|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|h2|nt|bt:  there is a minor suit squeeze though|pg||
pc|h3|nt|affe82:  N needs to cash @dA to not get caught, no?|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hA|pg||
nt|affe82:  2@h, 3@c and @d will endplay N i think now|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cQ|pc|c6|pc|c2|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|nt|bt:  i think he should have ruffed spade on the second trumpd|pg||
nt|affe82:  communication lost for squeeze|pg||
nt|bt:  trump, then a diamond|pg||
nt|bt:  so eventually one down unless I am missing something|pg||
nt|affe82:  @h9, @s to @hA, AKx@c and @d seem it would work often where decl were|pg||
nt|affe82:  so it seems|pg||
nt|affe82:  need to draw all trumps before @d above obv|pg||
nt|bt:  on the trump shift at trick 2, declarer can play the 9 and go about his dummy reversal|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|pjs_ch:  1N by Di here is the opening on all 14-16 balanced|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3C!|mb|p|mb|3S!|mb|p|nt|pjs_ch:  North will shows hearts & clubs over which South's artificial 3@S shows 3cd hearts but no club support|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  the 3@D and 3@H responses would have shown 4+ clubs|pg||
mb|4H|nt|pjs_ch:  the first along with 3 hearts, the second without 3 hearts|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pjs_ch:  Sorry - I gave the EW names wrongly a minute ago : East  = P = Padraig, West = M = Micheal|pg||
pc|d2|nt|pjs_ch:  the lead offers a chance to ditch a spade loser but if the lead was a fourth best diamond, the third round|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  would not cash and setting up the clubs could get awkward|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dT|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c5|pc|cQ|nt|pjs_ch:  if the diamonds are known to be 3-3 then ignoring the clubs and relying on heart entry to the long diamond wouldd|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|pc|c2|pc|cK|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  work.  But this is good play, tackling the important side suit first|pg||
pc|c4|pc|d5|nt|pjs_ch:  Micheal here playing the card he is known to hold, gives declarer a slight concern|pg||
pc|h7|pc|c9|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|nt|pjs_ch:  it's a bit worrying if that was East's second diamond from two |pg||
pc|d8|pc|d6|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  but here's the good news and now ditching the spade looks reasonable|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dJ|pc|sJ|pc|h3|pg||
pc|h8|nt|pjs_ch:  the best the defence can do is clear the hearts but it'll be 11 tricks either from long club or long diamonds|pg||

nt|pjs_ch:  with a certain two losers in diamonds and a very likely spade loser, Filip's best chance|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  might be to finesse this and ditch a club,  but  :(|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pjs_ch:  if it reaches him, this could be a 14-16 opener for Filip|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|pjs_ch:  3@S here shows a short club, ideally in a 3-suited hand; it's a slight overbid here|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|pjs_ch:  but being descriptive is often helpful|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D!|nt|pjs_ch:  North won't want 3N, and 4@D shows any hand with one major suit (4@C would show 0 or 2)|pg||
mb|p|nt|pjs_ch:  and they should meander to 5@D now|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pjs_ch:  (more quickly than I expected)|pg||
mb|p|nt|pjs_ch:  or maybe they play a simpler set of responses to 3@S  :)|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  a trump lead is standard on these auctions, even though it findd the queen for declarer|pg||
pc|hT|nt|pjs_ch:  the lack of a trump lead might of course suggest holding the queen ...|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|pjs_ch:  leading from QT9x into the NT opener here has risks, so there is a hint that the @HQ is offside|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  not that it will matter to declarer in the long run|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  if diamonds as 2-2 then it is just downto the spades, but if they are 3-1 then North must|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  be careful to ensure the chance to ruff both losing hearts|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  holding back the @HJ would have saved the need for one of those ruffs|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  but for all declarer knows,the @HT lead might have been a short suit, and heart ruffs|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h8|pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||

nt|bt:  marion went for option 1|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|3D|nt|bt:  this will be a normal TRF D/neg D auction|pg||
nt|bt:  D is presumably 4+@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4C|nt|bt:  whereas 1@S denies spades, a common treatment nowadays |pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|bt:  one good point, when competing where you have no chance of buying the contract, maybe you can handle the lead!?|pg||
mb|p|nt|affe82:  this makes if decl plays for Hx in trumph suit it seems to me|pg||
nt|affe82:  or am I missing something Lasse?|pg||
nt|bt:  well, they dont necessarily get a club trick, do they?|pg||
nt|vugraphzej: Marion is asking lots of questions |pg||
nt|bt:  not sure the explanation will match the bid :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|sA|nt|affe82:  e is a passed hand , i assume 2@d was a good raise in @H|pg||
pc|s6|nt|affe82:  at least he is close to that|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sT|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bt:  good is in the eye of the beholder|pg||
nt|bt:  i think the spade play by east here should be suit preference, what do you think fredrik?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|bt:  so 9=higher suit, hence @H|pg||
nt|bt:  marion doesnt have a losing line any more|pg||
