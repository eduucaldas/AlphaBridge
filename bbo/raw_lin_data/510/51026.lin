mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|affe82:  needed @hx2 and @c switch from e I think to threaten. Then she would still make if playing @s s for what I think is percentage|pg||

mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h2|nt|bt:  west trusted the opponents and didnt show his|pg||
nt|bt:  we can compare this to wademarks good raise on the previous hand|pg||

pc|s3|pc|sJ|pc|s7|pg||
nt|bt:  a good sac was found at the other table|pg||
nt|bt:  repeated trump leads might have beaten this|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|pc|cQ|pc|h5|pg||

nt|affe82:  communication lost for squeeze|pg||
nt|bt:  trump, then a diamond|pg||
nt|bt:  so eventually one down unless I am missing something|pg||
nt|affe82:  @h9, @s to @hA, AKx@c and @d seem it would work often where decl were|pg||
nt|affe82:  so it seems|pg||
nt|affe82:  need to draw all trumps before @d above obv|pg||
nt|bt:  on the trump shift at trick 2, declarer can play the 9 and go about his dummy reversal|pg||
