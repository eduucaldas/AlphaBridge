nt|kit: forgot off ace of hearts|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|kit: so even 5@D doesn't make.  But 4@H does, if they can stop there.|pg||
nt|kit: Difficult problem for North.  She has well above game-forcing values, and has been unable to show this so far.|pg||
nt|kit: But she can assume South would have raised immediately with 3-card support, and things don't look so good opposite a doubleton.|pg||
nt|kit: At other table South opened 2@S, which would probably be a more popular choice.|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c7|nt|kit: This will be doomed, and actually go down extras as declarer's best play will be to take spade finesse.|pg||
