nt|chip: probably too much bidding by S on such a soft hand. Still, if N were 5-4-3-1 instead would have a chance. None here.|pg||
nt|chip: from the lead declarer places W with the A or K of clubs, so expects E to have both major suit kings.|pg||

nt|ritong: some people (like me) use 1@s as a forcing bid, after 1@c 1@d 1@h, equivalent to a fourth suit|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|ritong: so, opener, with 4@s , has to bid them|pg||
nt|chip: sensible if don't respond 1D with 4S and a non-inv hand.|pg||
nt|ritong: at a level related to their strength|pg||
mb|2C|nt|chip: with good fit and friendly clubs, 4S makes.|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ritong: 2@s minimum, 3@s 1NT range, but 4@s would be clumsy if responder has not four cards|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|ritong: thus, the 3@h bid, which is close to really unuseful, except to show some obscure 6/5, can be used to show 4 cards in @ss and game strength|pg||
