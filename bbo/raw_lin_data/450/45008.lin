nt|jaker:  yes, that's an interesting position. my partnership usually leads rusinow, but 10 from Aq109x as an alarm clock|pg||

nt|kit: Good point -- if you lead the 10 from AQ109x partner may be misled but he won't go wrong.|pg||

mb|4C|mb|4H|nt|chip: normally routine to bid over this double as W, but perhaps versus this N it is percentage to just p.|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: hard for East to not drive to slam now|pg||
mb|4N|nt|chip: 6H requires not finessing spade at trick 1, then guessing heart Q.|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: And it is a pretty good slam, but probably won't make|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|chip: I think that is unlikely to happen, though possible.|pg||

mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: It may seem routine to play South for queen of hearts on the bidding, but perhaps not|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|kit: If North has king of spades slam will always be making (unless hearts 4-1) so assume South has it.|pg||
nt|kit: Is that an argument for playing North for queen of hearts, particularly when North doesn't lead a singleton which she might have on the auction?|pg||
nt|chip: other table NS never bid and S led a trump, so hand over.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|chip: also, S raised to 4C on Kxx of clubs and not a lot of shape. Maybe less attractive with spade K and heart Q?|pg||

nt|kit: In other words, the next time that preempt goes for 1100 there are 17 IMPs to draw from the preempt piggy bank and the bank will still have some IMPs left over.|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1N|nt|chip: here could have been a huge penalty if W had DBLed instead of bidding 4H.|pg||
mb|d|nt|chip: and agaisnt this pair, that is probably what she should have done.|pg||
nt|kit: Yes, but sometimes frisky preemptors really have their bids.|pg||
mb|2C|an|T/O but with 3+ !cs|nt|chip: I suspect part of bidding was to protect K of clubs.|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|chip: It is possible, but the a priori odds are well against it (particularly, since then they would often open 1).|pg||
nt|kit: 4@H is the winner here, but may be difficult to get to.|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|jaker:  they might work out to get diamond ruffs against hearts after this start|pg||
nt|chip: looks like 4H can be beaten by D ruffs. will they find them?|pg||
nt|kit: Nicely done.  Now defense will have to go for diamond ruff rather than trying to cash 2 clubs.or tapping dummy|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|sQ|nt|jaker:  would you consider doubling as west to try to alert partner to the void? could backfire, but big upside|pg||
nt|kit: Tapping dummy on third round of spades works when West has 10xxx of hearts|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sT|pc|s3|pg||
nt|kit: If East overtakes, cashes ace of clubs (discouragement from West), cashes ace of spades (and West drops jack) that might do it|pg||
nt|chip: 3 rounds of spades immediately still keeps the defense live.|pg||
nt|chip: on the lead should be clear declarer has all three missing kings.|pg||
nt|chip: of course W thinks partner has the D K for her NT overcall.|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s8|pc|sK|pc|s9|pg||
nt|kit: Now East has spade count presumably, and West has shown some club length, so maybe East can get this right|pg||
nt|chip: likely partner has 2 or zero D's.|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|pc|c2|pc|c7|pg||
nt|chip: moment of truth. 16 imps in the balance.|pg||
nt|kit: Now declarer has needed club entry to hand if dummy is tapped, so East has to go riight now|pg||
nt|kit: What is West's 2 of clubs?  Attitude or suit-preference?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|kit: Nicely done!!!|pg||

pc|d4|pc|h5|pc|d2|pg||
nt|kit: 16 IMPs were riding on that shift|pg||

mc|9|nt|chip: suggestion W might have tried leading the spade J at trick 1 as an alarm clock play.|pg||
nt|kit: why wouldn't that look normal from QJx?|pg||
nt|chip: they don't play rusinow versus suits.|pg||

nt|kit: I don't think East should let this go quietly.  She already knows that North doesn't really have a 3NT bid, so should double and scare North back to 4@D.|pg||
nt|chip: 3N probably same down 1 as 4D, though can be beaten 2 on a spade lead (but likely cash out for down 1 then too).|pg||

nt|robinswr: therefore you have to rebid 2nt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: heavy sarcasm    2N must be default with 2@S rebid guaranteeing 6+@S|pg||
nt|swanson:  This is an in-between hand for South after a 5-card major opening.  Really not quite enough to force to game, but too much (with the good 5-carder) to invite, either.|pg||
