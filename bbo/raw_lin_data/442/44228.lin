mb|1S|mb|p|nt|BroLucius:  Even if you play5-card majors, most players are not willing to bid a Jacoby 2NT with only 3-card support.|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|dburn:  3NT possible, if closely defined|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|dburn:  but 2@c is the fallback these days|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|BroLucius:  Yes, 3NT not so attractive when you know there is a 5-3 fit. More of an Acol response on that shape, perhaps. |pg||
nt|dburn:  game-forcing, usually clubs but sometimes just balanced|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  2@C must forcing to game.|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|paulg:  we are now in the scary part of 2/1, both hands fairly unlimited|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|BroLucius:  North has a minimum but she describes her shape so that partner can judge whether the diamond shortage is good news.|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  Do you think South might have considered 3NT, David?|pg||
nt|dburn:  indeed - or, of course, just in case partner actually has clubs despite having bid them|pg||
nt|dburn:  3NT in auctions where a major has been agreed is often played as conventional - if it were natural and offering a choice of games, sure South might bid it|pg||
pc|d7|nt|BroLucius:  At the other table, it was a mundane 1@S - 2@D - 2@H - 4@S.|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  The cards lie well but, of course, declarer does not know that.|pg||
nt|dburn:  not toally clear what's best after ruffing the diamond - maybe a club, maybe a heart|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  Perhaps a club looks normal, since the @D10 helps you in that suit later.|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  @H10|pg||
nt|dburn:  the auction, though, has been helpful to the defenders - if you play a club to the king and it wins, you still don't know what to do|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  Many pairs like to lead 2nd best from spot-cards and 4th best from honours.|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|nt|paulg:  the lead looks like second highest and the @dK tells you the layout|pg||
nt|dburn:  ruff, club to king, three rounds of hearts looks workmanlike, or perhaps workpersonlike|pg||
nt|dburn:  but now declarer can pretty much rely on a ruffing diamond finesse - West ought to have played the ace, not the king|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  Can she be thinking of discarding? Or just what to do on the next trick?|pg||
nt|dburn:  back later - off to the Portrush yacht club, a few miles up the road from the actio here|pg||

mb|1C|nt|BroLucius:  Nothing much wrong with the England bidding at the other table, but they went four down in 3NT.|pg||
mb|3D|nt|BroLucius:  Both Souths have bid a full 3@D despite the vulnerability. Well done!|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|paulg:  Conservative pass from Helen Kane, but the same result|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|pc|dK|nt|paulg:  East-West have a conservative style and full strength openers, so I agree that double is best. The hand with shortage should strain to take action.|pg||

nt|BroLucius:  A 4-trick difference will have the analysts interested when they lookat the score-card on the archive tomorrow.|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|BroLucius:  Declarer will be close to double-dummy, when South shows 3 clubs in addition to her 7-card diamond suit.|pg||
