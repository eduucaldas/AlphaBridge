mb|5N|mb|p|nt|paulg:  I think Willard is considering whether it is worth asking for @dQ ...|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|mb|6D|mb|p|nt|paulg:  Willard can still not see 13 tricks, very tough hand even when East opens|pg||

nt|paulg:  Yes, that is a reasonable view|pg||
nt|barnets: West bid 6@D with a slight pause|pg||
nt|barnets: but still East could justify|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  if you were going to bid 7@d, then over 5NT is the best time just in case partner tanks|pg||
mb|p|pc|h6|nt|dburn:  2@s because 3@d would show extras in the French style, or maybe because it would guarantee four diamonds, or both|pg||

mb|4C|nt|dburn:  or East can bid 4@c, South can bid 4@s and North can pass it|pg||

nt|queequeg: all live matches: http://wbchampbulletin.org/live-matches/|pg||
nt|dburn:  but pass should mean something also, I guess|pg||

mb|1H|nt|Walddk2:  I recommend that you follow Helgemo's play overall. That's profitable in the long run.|pg||
mb|1S|nt|paulg:  Monaco v Spain appears to be tied, so this isn't even the closest match|pg||

pc|d3|nt|Walddk2:  and a weak NT.|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Spain-Monaco 176-176 with 4 to go.|pg||
