nt|OleBerg:  3ut is a winner with open cards|pg||
nt|stigw: Best to stay low in a prtscore, but difficult and where ?|pg||

nt|bettinakal:  Last board of this session, next session in 1Â½ hour??|pg||
nt|stigw: The last chance for Denmark to improve the score before the break.|pg||
nt|kit: Chance for Denmark if they bid this vul game|pg||
mb|1H|mb|3C|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|stigw: Can they bid and make game here (should clearly be in Hearts then) ?|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bettinakal:  4@h can make, a maximum of 3 losers, 2 in @s and a @c|pg||
mb|p|nt|stigw: They did. It only remains to make it !|pg||
pc|d8|nt|kit: I think can score 1 spade 1 club, 2 diamonds and 6 hearts on any reasonable line of play|pg||
nt|kit: And now 3 diamond tricks, so can make 11 tricks.|pg||
nt|bettinakal:  this lead might make it easier for decl|pg||
nt|bettinakal:  can now set up dummy|pg||
nt|stigw: With no cl-support from Zia Meck had a difficult opening lead, and diamonds look "touch and go" !|pg||
nt|stigw: But Zia will with-hold his D Q, so it might not be that big a help.|pg||
nt|kit: I wonder if 3@H call was limit raise -- if not, the 4@H bid seems aggressive|pg||
nt|kit: How can Zia hold off -- 8 might be from K98|pg||
nt|stigw: Reading it right, he can cash 2 times di, and enter the table with club ace to cash the 3rd diamond and throw his club.|pg||
nt|stigw: When he leads the 8 from 983, it cannot be from K98, I guess.|pg||
nt|kit: I'm sure it can be|pg||
nt|kit: Actually, declarer may go up ace of diamonds to play a spade|pg||
nt|stigw: Their methods might not reveal, if Meck has got 1,2 or 3 cards in Diamonds, so Peter certainly has a problem.|pg||

pc|sA|pg||
nt|stigw: This was the most unfortunate way to play it.|pg||
nt|kit: But with the misguess, declarer could be in trouble.  He will need trump end-play, and may not be able to ruff himself down without some help.|pg||
