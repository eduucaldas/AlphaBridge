nt|ahollan1: question from spec for the panel   what are reasons for de wijs bidding 5@C rather than 5@D|pg||
pc|h4|pc|s2|pc|s3|pg||

nt|bettinakal:  we all have lesson in patience today, watching Muller, a real thinker...some say it is "cheating" all this thinking, others says it is BRIDGE   :)|pg||
nt|vugrapho2: Both, De Wijis and Muller wrote that s @h+@d|pg||
nt|kit: oh, then 5@C is fine -- show the club control, and give partner a chance to bid 5@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: some were hoping 5@D suggested 56 with slam try but most agree with what i expected to hear from Kit -- 5@D denies @C control|pg||
nt|kit: Not obvious how to play this, as danger of being forced|pg||
nt|kit: I think cash 2 top hearts, ruff club, and take diamond finesse |pg||
nt|kit: Danger in taking heart finesse is if it loses and another spade forces the long hand, then it gets dangerous|pg||
nt|bettinakal:  that plan will really hurt if trump 4-1, but he might not make it anyway, if 4-1 in @h|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for  20  since 5@C=cue  east 5@D would also be cue - NOT suggesting @D as alternative trump suit|pg||
