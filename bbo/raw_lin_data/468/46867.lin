mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|d|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|barnets: See how the non standard preempt wil cause a swing|pg||
nt|bettinakal:  Hi all, first board of 2nd session and Northe tries to see which way the wind blows|pg||
nt|barnets: North thinking of doubling here but some pairs play X means I want to save |pg||
nt|bettinakal:  now a days it is impossible to penalise...I miss the good old days  :)|pg||
nt|barnets: looks like dec has 8 tricks in spades at least|pg||
nt|vankan:  Both 3@h and 3NT are (how shal I put that carefully) rather non standard, but the reault will be non standard too|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|barnets: So question is what does X mean ?|pg||
nt|vankan:  If Brink now bids he falls into his own trap|pg||
nt|barnets: to this pair in their agreements|pg||
nt|vankan:  I do not know in sequences like these. They used to play dbl is I wish to bid on, but lately they changed that. |pg||
nt|vankan:  But that is in constructive sequences|pg||
nt|vankan:  Sequences that start witha preempt like that can hardly be called constructive|pg||
nt|barnets: here is an example 3@H 3@S4@H4@S X means i wish to bid on unless you can beat it|pg||
nt|barnets: this is a similar auction|pg||
nt|barnets: as 3N is a bid partner does not now his values|pg||
nt|vankan:  Probably figuring whether to take -500 or -590|pg||
nt|barnets: when the partners values are unknown X is I like to bid on|pg||
