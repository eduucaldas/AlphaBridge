mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|athene: perhaps he was concerned that his partner's main suit was clubs - in that case 3@D might make things very awkward for him|pg||
nt|athene: and might take them past the best spot of 3NT|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|athene: passing the double was an option of course - but it's very committal and needs east to have a hand at the defensive end of a t-o double to be right|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps there's more to the EW bidding than meets the eye, but it seems very tentatitve to me, given they have 11 solid tricks and only the black aces stop 12|pg||

nt|athene: because firstly, you can signal so as to make it look you are out of partner's suit even when you aren't|pg||
nt|athene: and it doesn't matter if partner is in on the deception or not|pg||

mb|1C|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|athene: notice how Zia doesn't try to show his hand "scientifically" as a 2-suiter|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: some might consider 3@D or something over 2@D to show both majors, which does give you the best theoretical chance of finding a good fit|pg||
nt|athene: but he would much rather put maximum pressure on, take as much space away as possible, and tell the opponents less about the hand|pg||
nt|athene: also he knows his partner probably doesn't have an unbalanced hand (since he has surely some values and he passed over 1@C)|pg||
nt|athene: so it is not so likely you need to be in hearts rather than spades|pg||
nt|athene: the only time you really want to play a 6-5 in the 5-card suit is when partner has something like 4 of those and only 1 of the other|pg||
nt|athene: and north probably balanced so that's not the issue|pg||

nt|athene: west showed up with @DA to six and @CQJ|pg||
nt|athene: and the @SQ implied from east failing to over-ruff|pg||
nt|athene: so maybe Zia thought ok, with the @HQ as well he would open|pg||
nt|athene: but still i am wondering what layout he is playing for where this is necessary|pg||
nt|athene: just ruff a club looked obvious|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h9|pc|h4|nt|athene: i guess he's worried about west having @SQ9xx but in that case he is likely to be short in hearts anyway|pg||
nt|athene: maybe playing him for @SQ9xx @Hx @DA1098xx @CQ?|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|athene: sorry @Hxx|pg||
nt|athene: kibitzers are suggesting east having @SQ9xx and refusing to over-ruff|pg||
nt|athene: but in that case you want to go for a sort of trump coup; maybe just cash @HAK early and try to ruff hearts|pg||
nt|athene: the heart finesse is just a pointless risk|pg||
nt|athene: and also if east has the @SQ you can't be sure from the HCP count that west doesn't have the @HQ anyway|pg||
nt|athene: so basically it's all very puzzling|pg||
nt|athene: often what happens is you think for hours then it turns out he didn't finesse the jack at all :)|pg||
