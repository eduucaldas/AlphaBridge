mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|pjs_ch:  We are starting with boards 15-16 here to allow the other table|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|pjs_ch:  to get ahead and to allow comparisons|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|pjs_ch:  Not a bad hand for East - a balanced 28 points doesn't come up very often|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|pjs_ch:  not clear what 4@C is here, not everyone has things organised for this sequence|pg||
mb|6N|mb|p|nt|pjs_ch:  but the total point count is being recognised and West has landed|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  them in a sensible contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzah: I'm not sure they know either|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|d5|nt|pjs_ch:  this contract should be an easy make, losing just one club|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  East's only worry will be a bad club break, and cashing the AK|pg||
