nt|vugrapha1: 2 more score to come in from the closed room|pg||
nt|loganrun:  This NS pair have been their best for VQP and probably think with board 31, they are down this set by 5-8 imps|pg||
nt|kim_f:  1 imp with 2 boards to go|pg||
nt|kim_f:  quite nail biting isn't it|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: in the closed room south is declaring a contract on 31 (that's all i can see from here)|pg||
nt|loganrun:  They will be surprised with the closeness one way or another|pg||
nt|kim_f:  for sure|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: here comes the result on 31|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: ooh - game swing to VQP|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: so Pennant need 11 IMPs on this one|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: bidding and making 4@s won't be enough|pg||
nt|kim_f:  ouch|pg||
nt|kim_f:  that looks like the sealer then|pg||
nt|loganrun:  Well done (reservedly) to VQP|pg||
nt|kim_f:  yes well done to the underdogs|pg||
nt|loganrun:  Perhaps the underdogs but not by as much as many may think|pg||
nt|loganrun:  Bye all|pg||
nt|kim_f:  well it proves that pairs who play regularly together do have an edge|pg||
nt|kim_f:  and the VQP team are all regular partnerships|pg||
nt|kim_f:  whilst only ebery/gold have had a lot of playing experience together|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: board 32 result coming in now|pg||
nt|kim_f:  thanks Dave|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: board 32 was flat|pg||
nt|kim_f:  so VQP team by 11|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: so VQP have won!|pg||
nt|kim_f:  gratz to them|pg||
nt|kim_f:  thanks everyone|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: best of luck to this most deserving team at the ANC in July in Canberra where they will be the Victorian Open Team|pg||
