nt|nils123:  An interesting contract of 3@d, you are most likely to end up giving defense AK of club, AJ of @h and still have to play the diamonds |pg||
nt|nils123:  we did see this diamond position in the first match, i guess a double finesse thru north is the best way of playing this suit|pg||

nt|nils123:  Todd-Moir have had some nice moments in this match, i kind of like this 6@h bid, even as it is a bit wild. |pg||

mb|p|nt|nils123:  Bune did nice to give it a try, i think i would bid 3N|pg||
nt|vugraphzcs: I'm told 2nt is a Gazilli version. 2nt show 5-5+@H and @Cs, 15+hp|pg||
mb|4D!|mb|p|nt|Luffe12:  Looks like some sort of GF-sequence|pg||

nt|Luffe12:  Just looking at Gazilli right now - a lot to memorize, but playing 2/1 it makes a lot of sense|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|nils123:  well done bye the danes to push this board|pg||
nt|nils123:  i dont think Gazilli have anything to do with 2/1|pg||
nt|nils123:  it is a very strong convention for rebidding the opener hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzcs: T-M confirms whas Buus-Thomsen said. Except it's 16+hp:)|pg||
