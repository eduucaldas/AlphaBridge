nt|lady007:  http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/BPinfo/OpenTeams/Austria/AUTOT_SIMON-TERRANEO.pdf|pg||
nt|lady007:  and NS CC|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|nt|lady007:  1@C strong, 2@C natural and GF|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|lady007:  now east is asking for wests exact distribution and strength|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lady007:  4@D was a puppet to 4@H, to show a sign off in some suit|pg||
nt|lady007:  any other bid would have been a slam try or keycard asking for some trump suit|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|lady007:  east was probably not sure if west had the queen of clubs, and didnt want to risk playing 5@c off two aces and a sure trump trik|pg||
nt|lady007:  trick|pg||
pc|h6|nt|lady007:  so now they have ended up in 4@S. declarer has to be carefull not to be shortened in trumps|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hK|pc|h9|pc|h7|pg||
nt|lady007:  as we can see 3NT would have been a lot easier, but thats the problem sometimes with relay sequences: you cant find out the exact position of the honors under 3NT|pg||
nt|lady007:  so east didnt know if west had the king of hearts (and even if he did, they would have wrongsided NT)|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s2|pc|sT|nt|lady007:  and he didnt want to play 3NT when west has two little hearts|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c4|pc|c7|nt|lady007:  De Wijs finessed the jack of spades in the first round, so he still has a trump left in his hand to take care of a heart return|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
pc|sK|nt|lady007:  if he had played a spade to the king, and later a spade to the ten, NS could have forced him to ruff in the dummy (its played by the short side)|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|pc|s9|pg||
nt|lady007:  NS doing well to cut his communications|pg||
nt|lady007:  He cant draw trumps now and then enjoy his clubs|pg||
pc|c2|nt|lady007:  if they play another club, the contract would be down for sure if north held the QJ of diamonds. now declarer has to guess|pg||
nt|lady007:  can he cash another club? or should he play a diamond to the ten directly and hope for Qx or Qxx onside|pg||
nt|lady007:  even if he cashes another club the diamond queen has to be onside|pg||
nt|lady007:  I think he suspects that south has 4 spades|pg||
nt|lady007:  because he was thinking when it went spade to the king, and the 9 dropped from north|pg||
nt|lady007:  but he doesnt know if south has 962 or 62 of clubs|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cJ|pc|cK|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s4|nt|lady007:  and I dont think he is sure about the heart position either|pg||

pc|d4|pg||
nt|lady007:  The Terraneo/Simon CC does not define a range for their weak 2 bids. But it says that it can be 5crd and the style is depending on vulnerability and position. That makes me wonder if this hand is not a little too strong|pg||
nt|lady007:  but of course you also put pressure on the opponents and white/red you have more points to win when they make a mistake, then to lose when you end up wrong yourself|pg||
nt|lady007:  to have a chance to defeat 3@S, Muller should switch to a club. However, that might persuade declarer to play the spades from the top, and then he will make an overtrick|pg||

nt|lady007:  wild hand coming up here|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|4H|an|,|nt|lady007:  NS can make 3 spades and EW can make 5@H. Both sides have a huge fit so the bidding is not likely to stop anytime soon|pg||
nt|lady007:  did south overcall 4@H or 4@S? maybe 4@H shows a good 4@S overcall|pg||

mb|5S|nt|lady007:  Now its become a guessing game|pg||
nt|lady007:  4@s is a good raise in @H. Not sure if it already asks for keycards ( i think not)|pg||
nt|lady007:  it might be good for EW to just bid slam at this vulnerability. Its unlikely NS will let them play it when they have a very cheap save|pg||
nt|lady007:  the are more likely to take -500 then risk -1430|pg||

nt|lady007:  they will take their -500 'insurance', which I am sure the Dutch think adds upp nicely to their 200 in the other room|pg||
nt|lady007:  I have some sympathy though, for the bid|pg||
nt|lady007:  and also well done (in a way) to Muller- de Wijs. I think Muller was not even convinced 5@S was going down and was probably hoping for just this, that NS would bid slam|pg||
nt|lady007:  North thinking about if he should duck the club, finesse the spade, etc. He is hoping for spades to be 2-0 because otherwise 6@H is down|pg||
nt|lady007:  but as we can see it doesnt matter much how he plays it|pg||
