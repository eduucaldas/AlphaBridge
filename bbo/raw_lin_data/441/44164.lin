nt|vugraphzef: "If you can win 3nt then you could also win 5@c" says Knut Blakset|pg||

nt|ahollan1: the alert is because non-forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|OleBerg:  Their agreement is that 2@S is slightly constructive but non-forcing, so the lower range of the hcp-interval is to cater or unbalanced hands|pg||
nt|OleBerg:  Will East try an "impossible" reverse of 3@D?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: there was auction in Q3 where 2@S was forcing, but that was after 2nd hand overcall  2@C-(2@D)-2@S|pg||

nt|jesperdall:  Schaltz just needs to find a way to 25 imps more than the Konow - and they all count!|pg||
nt|vugraphzef: should the Schaltz team play a little different in this last segment than they normally would -- or is the 25 imps not enough to change their strategy?|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  Being behind by only 25 imps, they will play normally for a start|pg||
nt|sommer:  well, b 29 MIGHT be a possible 12-13 imps swing in 6@C, S|pg||

nt|ahollan1: that was written on many whiteboards at my last job|pg||
nt|OleBerg:  But a few call it MalmÃ¶-leads, especially if you are allowed to lead the top from xxx. You may consider it blasphemy, but they still do. :)|pg||

mb|1D!|mb|2C|nt|nilsland:  With a slam here Schaltz may get a little closer, but not enough|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unlike schaltz-christiansen  Dorthe-Peter sometimes play 1N=10-12|pg||
nt|stigw: Can they reach 6 sp here, that would be a worthy greeting from the runner-up.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so 1N = BAL  and range that does not fit opening 1N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: last 2 sets we've see a lot of Kingletons and singleton Queens|pg||
nt|stigw: Very difficult to see, that this is in fact a "double-fit".|pg||
nt|OleBerg:   1@D is (14) 15-17 bal|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right   because opening 1N at these colours would be 10-13|pg||
nt|stigw: Diamonds probably dosnt promise diamonds, so how to find out of all this with your waisted cl K ?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for schaltz-christiansen  1@D always a weak [but not quite mini] NT|pg||
mb|4D!|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|OleBerg:  4@D likely SA-Texas, transfer to spades|pg||
nt|OleBerg:  A 4@H bid by north might have helped|pg||
mb|4N!|nt|OleBerg:  But then again, if South finds another bid, North will be unstopable|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: extra credit if you can tell why use of 4@C/@D as transfers is called South African|pg||
