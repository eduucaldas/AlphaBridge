nt|stigw: 5 cl a making sacrifice !!!|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  I guess south will take te push to 5@s with his spade support...|pg||
mb|3H|nt|stigw: And 5 H also profitable against 4 sp making.|pg||
nt|vugraphzef: very difficult to get to 5@cs isnt it?|pg||
nt|vugraphzef: or maybe even impossible :)|pg||
mb|d|an|extra|nt|nilsland:  only a club ruff beats 5H DD|pg||
nt|stigw: Ill say impossible, but 5 H also ok as a sacrifice, and N/S might veruy well carry on.|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  South has less than zero defense against 5@h, so it's 4@s or 5@s - I guess|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  What does north's double show?|pg||
mb|4D|nt|stigw: Dennis will probably go to 5 sp over 5 any, so a sure + to Schaltz here, I guess.|pg||

nt|jesperdall:  Looks like a simple 3NT with the diamonds behaving|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  Now, on the previous board - who would bid 5@c directly as North?|pg||
nt|stigw: Game in 3 nt or diamonds, but how strong or weak is 2 nt ?|pg||
mb|4C!|an|transfer to !d|mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|nt|stigw: Adamsen goes for diamonds, understandably but not the easiest way to success.|pg||
nt|vugraphzef: 2nt = 20-21|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  Hmm, I would take my chances in 3NT as north...|pg||

pc|hK|pc|h4|pc|h7|nt|stigw: I personally play this sequence as a slam suggestion, yes - there you see. He should just have bid 5 cl as a transfer to 5 di - at least when  sp Aace as here is in the "wrong" ...|pg||
nt|stigw: hand.|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s2|nt|stigw: The only chance was to find sp ace in West's hand. Now down 1 I guess.|pg||

nt|nilsland:  with another lead 3-3 in clubs and 4-4 in spades is enough|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|stigw: Mats is right, but the diamond break and distribution was lucky, so 5 di (or perhaps 3 nt) was preferable.|pg||
mb|3S|nt|nilsland:  of course Stig - it was a horrible slam|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  So: Schaltz lose 6 on board 30, and wins 13 on 31...best guess, that is|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dQ|pc|d7|pc|d2|pc|dA|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  A bit timid to bid only game here on this auction as south, but well judged|pg||
nt|stigw: After that posiible gain to Schaltz we should have a "breather" here in 4 sp. Now overtricks possible.|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  Would any of you make a slam try as south after 3@s by partner?|pg||
nt|vugraphzef: these two teams also played eachother in the semifinal in 2014 |pg||
nt|vugraphzef: that match was decided in the FINAL BOARD|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h4|pc|hA|nt|stigw: If South hade cued in 4 di, he would have received a club lead, so after all a good decision just to bid 4 sp.|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|pc|c4|nt|nilsland:  depends on the strength of 3S I think, here it seems to show only an unbalanced minimum|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h5|pc|c9|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  I agree - I think 3@s shows a good minimum with 4 spades|pg||

pc|c6|pc|c5|pc|cA|pc|c2|pg||
nt|stigw: He didnt believe his own eyes here, might have made 13, but 11 is good enough (its imps. not pairs).|pg||
pc|h9|nt|vugraphzef: in the other semifinal Konow is up by 37 imps|pg||
nt|vugraphzef: and the lineup in that match is:|pg||
nt|stigw: My evalutation is, that Schaltz has regained the 4 imps they were behind, so quite open now (seen from our table).|pg||
nt|vugraphzef: Open: Konow-Askgaard vs HC Graversen - Poul Clemmensen|pg||
nt|vugraphzef: Closed: Houmøller-Schaffer EW vs Dennis-Morten Bilde|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  I agree, Stig, with you imps assesment - very even match!|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  Dennis thinking hard - "what if the spades are 4-1?"|pg||
nt|vugraphzef: IF - and I say IF this match ends with a draw -- the four extra boards to be played|pg||
