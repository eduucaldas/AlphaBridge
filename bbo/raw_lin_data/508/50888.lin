nt|bagman:  The defense cashes the clubs and declarer takes the rest (probably later asking how the hearts were because NS can make 4@H if the hearts run)|pg||
pc|c5|nt|bagman:  EW have a chance to block the clubs|pg||
pc|s7|pc|cT|pc|s4|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 14-16|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|runnerup:  3nt doesnt look so easy but has been made|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc:  defense slipped at other table|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|fabsayc:  declarer was allowed to set up a club trick, and then defense failed to lead spades|pg||
nt|runnerup:  @s in time but not seen in other table ,,maybe difficult here also|pg||
nt|bagman:  At the other table, declarer ducked the first club (7 from hand) won the 2nd and played back one more; West returned a heart|pg||
nt|ahollan1: last board for segment 6 of 8    last 2 sets of 15 starts in 50-55 min|pg||
nt|fuquay:  There do not appear to be enough entries for S to set up hearts on his own|pg||
nt|runnerup:  this helps one trick but declarer in other table didnt take,,but other @c honour ,now he wanted that |pg||
pc|c2|pc|c9|pc|cA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: warning:  there is a board from segment 5 that is being reviewed  so  running score may be different when you get back|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i do not know any details|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c3|pc|cT|pc|c5|pg||
nt|bagman:  Both players are minimum, the hands do not fit well, there is shortage of tricks and shortage of communications; a very difficult 3NT to make|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hK|pc|h8|pc|h6|pg||
nt|bagman:  and it needs little help from the defense|pg||
pc|d9|nt|runnerup:  open cards he is home now |pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|nt|fuquay:  And he certainly got some by being given a club entry to dummy|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan2: or what McKenzie said|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: Rosenberg: "Missed a game [4@H]." Lall laughs: "Should've staymanned." Rosenberg: "Someone tells me always to do that, but I forget who"|pg||

nt|bagman:  Both players have minimums and the hands do not fit well; it looks like this goes down mostly due to lack of tricks and lack of entries|pg||
nt|bagman:  West needs to stay away from the critical (red) suits|pg||
nt|bagman:  West can assume that declarer has doubleton @H and another 4 card suit|pg||
nt|bagman:  He can be pretty sure that attacing declarer's 4 card suit is going to be fatal|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: No, South can have 3 hearts on this auction. 3NT allows him to pass with 3 hearts. Pepsi has another way to show 5 hearts and force Rosenberg to pull with 3|pg||
