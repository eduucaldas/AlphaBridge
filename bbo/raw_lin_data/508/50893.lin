pc|hJ|pc|h9|pc|h3|pc|h2|pg||
nt|fabsayc:  i think only going down 1|pg||
nt|ritong: when pard doubles 1NT after having passed 1@d, it means that his shape did not allow a direct take out double, ergo @d opposition  i would thus duck the lead|pg||
nt|kit:  That cost an undertrick.  I don't understand the duck.  Might not partner have the queen?|pg||
nt|kit:  Even if not, I don't see how duck can gain.|pg||
nt|fabsayc:  Martel does not know declarer has only three clubs|pg||
nt|kit:  I think he has to assume that.|pg||

nt|ahollan1: open room has finished play|pg||
mb|5H|nt|kit:  Once West shows up with 2 hearts, the double club finesse is quite reasonable, after which East will be squeezed in the black suits|pg||

nt|rduran1216:  there's a 100% chance they get to 6D in 2 more bids|pg||

mb|5N|nt|ahollan1: 5N =  you pick|pg||

mb|p|mb|6D|nt|Vugraphzfv: Which is a quite proper thing to do if your screenmate's bid came out quickly|pg||

mb|3D|nt|fabsayc:  who bid 3@D|pg||
nt|kit:  North very optimistic here I think, and could result in getting doubled.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C = 2+@C    //   1N = 18-19   [vul 1N opener would be 15-17]|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: Greco looks quizzically at Fleisher about 3@d. Fleisher shrugs his shoulders.|pg||
mb|d|nt|ritong: geoff preparing the axe|pg||
nt|kit:  With takeout double behind the strong hand, looking for a thin major-suit game seems too optimistic.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit:  Now N-S will certainly be doubled wherever they land.|pg||
nt|fabsayc:  takeout double of 2@D was fine, accomplishs the goal with little risk|pg||

nt|rduran1216:  I think with Axx of diamonds and knowing partner didn't bid over 1Cx, South will pass,...he certainly should|pg||

nt|drewsky:  Fleisher lands on his feet, again ! I guess sometimes its just your day.|pg||
nt|rduran1216:  yeah just gotta play for 3-3 spdaes|pg||
nt|fabsayc:  hampson does not have a lock, but he has to suspect this is down|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfv: Chip told Geoff that 3@d then 3@s had to be 5413 or 5404|pg||
nt|kit:  Looks like he has 7 trump tricks and a trick in every other suit.|pg||
nt|fabsayc:  how does he get back to hand for second diamond ruff|pg||
