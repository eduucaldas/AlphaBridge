mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|Skorchev: 3@D is a nice bid; DBL cannot be a choice in non-vul part-score in teams|pg||
nt|andreakis:  simple cue, W is playing 5@D doubled on the other table|pg||
nt|andreakis:  on a singleton club lead it is a good contract, but needs some good card reading skills|pg||
nt|Skorchev: entry problems to take @C finesse twice may lead to 1 off in 5@D|pg||
nt|Skorchev: still a lot depend on the defence|pg||

nt|andreakis:  expensive|pg||

nt|jni33:  In my opinion Bas Drijver - Sjoert Brink beats the rest of the world :)|pg||
nt|Skorchev: the standard approach is to bid 2NT=good bad (12-14 or 18+) and direct bid at 3L shows 15-17|pg||
