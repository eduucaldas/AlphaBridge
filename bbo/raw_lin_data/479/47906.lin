mb|1C!|nt|dagold:  Hello everyone. Good morning still just about|pg||
nt|marlowepi: welcome back to the 15th edition of oChampions Cup|pg||
mb|1H|nt|marlowepi: Your commentating team will be led by the great Enhglish international David Gold|pg||
mb|d!|an|!s|mb|r|nt|dagold:  the host nation are struggling and will be hoping for some good results from here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this match pits the Lavazza squad against the host country's national team|pg||
nt|dagold:  Thanks Marshal|pg||
nt|dagold:  is 1@c strong?|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|2H|nt|marlowepi: i must be off to another room Enjoy !!|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: no they play 2+|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: basically natura;|pg||
nt|dagold:  Kiril Marinovski is Bulgarain but has lived in Croatia for sometie|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|dagold:  he is one of their best players|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S hand compatible with strong club, and in Kiril's home country of Bulgaria almost al the elite play Precision|pg||
nt|dagold:  Goran Borevkovik has been one of their top players for many years|pg||
mb|p|nt|dagold:  It looks like 2@d may have been an invented reverse|pg||
mb|p|nt|dagold:  but I a unsure|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that is my assessment aso|pg||
nt|marlowepi: also|pg||
nt|dagold:  South has done well to stop in 3@c after the negative double|pg||
nt|dagold:  this should be an easy make with the well placed spade Ace|pg||
nt|marlowepi: would you double with the N hand david (or bid 1S in a different method) ?|pg||
nt|dagold:  I would pass|pg||
nt|dagold:  with only 5 points, heart length and my strength largely in opps suit|pg||
nt|marlowepi: me too. woud bow the dust off a green card and place it in the tray|pg||
nt|dagold:  I wont miss anything. the time to stretch is with short hearts. Txxx x Axxxx Jxx|pg||
nt|dagold:  for example is a clear double|pg||
pc|h4|nt|dagold:  well, if you are passing Marshal|pg||
nt|dagold:  I think it is a pass |pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|pc|hT|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, useful shape and such points as we have will be working, and are even convertible for defese|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d8|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
nt|dagold:  Kiril did well here to stop frankly|pg||
nt|marlowepi: there are circles in which "Marshall passed" ends the discussion :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: ok gotta go|pg||
nt|dagold:  bye|pg||
nt|dagold:  we dont know if Dennis Bilde agrees since i the other roo after 1@c west overcalled 2@h|pg||
nt|dagold:  it is a mmatter of style between 1 and 2|pg||
nt|dagold:  neither is right or wrong|pg||
nt|dagold:  The italian style with preepting is quite sound and pure especially when not at the most favourable vulnerability|pg||
nt|dagold:  Diego Brenner is brazilian|pg||
nt|dagold:  but he plays the italian way|pg||
nt|dagold:  Bocchi is of course one of the italian legends|pg||

mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dagold:  Interesting that Bocchi did not cater to clubs with 4N but he would have no safetyin doing that|pg||
nt|dagold:  as 5@c might be a 4-3 fit|pg||
nt|dagold:  partner being say 2533|pg||
nt|dagold:  Not entirely sure why this was doubled|pg||
pc|d4|nt|dagold:  but Bocchi will love the dummy and is playing for an overtrick|pg||
nt|dagold:  Goran has a lot of points to be fair to hi|pg||
nt|dagold:  and his minors will produce two tricks|pg||
nt|dagold:  but Kiril is defensively broke|pg||
nt|pilogen:  Is there an endplay in case N holds @HQxx?|pg||

nt|dagold:  I tend to bid but seem to get plenty of the wrong|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s8|nt|dagold:  5@h might get you to a slam if partner is huge. I suspect 5@h is weaker than 4N then 5@h for them|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sA|pg||
nt|dagold:  other room also in 5@H doubled so it is flat if defence doesnt do anything sill|pg||
nt|dagold:  silly|pg||
nt|dagold:  I guess both norths wanted to protect possible plus in 4@s|pg||
nt|dagold:  and liked their well placed looking minors|pg||
nt|dagold:  Q!x heart a worry as opps have bid 5@h missing it and it's dropping|pg||
nt|dagold:  bocchi conisdering the 3-0 heart breaks|pg||
nt|pilogen:  Bocchi is figuring out a line in case @H don't split|pg||
nt|dagold:  doeshe need to play diamond acediamond ruff|pg||
nt|dagold:  that sort of thing|pg||
nt|dagold:  we can see it is making on simple line|pg||
nt|dagold:  but he has to consider the not unlikley 3-0 split|pg||
nt|dagold:  this is what seperates the really good players. they consider everything|pg||

nt|jni33:  and a real "trust in partner" bid from Giorgio Duboin|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in general, partner should not be preempting our side (esp with nonvul opps passing) with anything except a one-dimensional hand, or else a hand than can take control comfortably ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: once S does what he has been instructed to do.|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cJ|pc|cA|pc|c5|pg||

nt|jni33:  and the defence making sure that this goes down with 2@s tricks for East|pg||
nt|marlowepi: moral of the story: when it is not clear whether to overrule partner, don't do it. This principle has many applications in bidding and defense|pg||
nt|jni33:  North certainly had a "one-dimensional hand" .. unless South had a @h-suit :)|pg||

pc|s7|nt|dagold:  the lucky heart layout meanshe can make this. Diamonds work for him also|pg||

nt|dagold:  I just think he will work it all out|pg||
nt|dagold:  there is some info, spade overcall and raise means east has a high card outside spades by the look of trick 1|pg||
nt|dagold:  and that card is surely the diaond king|pg||
nt|dagold:  the heart jack is QJ doubleton or stiff jack|pg||
nt|dagold:  probably|pg||
nt|dagold:  because people are afraid of playing from JX|pg||
nt|dagold:  these are the type of things declarer is considering|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|h2|pg||

nt|pilogen:  With Kxxx in dummy and the A in declarer's hand the J will not give away anything anyway|pg||

nt|dagold:  might from jx if declarer has at9. psycologically people do not like playing from jx|pg||
nt|dagold:  but I agree it cannot be ruled out|pg||

mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: on the surface, 2S seems an uncharacteristically risky bid by W, but perhaps they play that a double would not be about spades, or maybe tW was not sure how it would be taken|pg||
nt|jni33:  NS bidding their suits naturally when gameforcing ... thats why S started with 1@s showing 4+@d |pg||
nt|ady: heart position gives this play|pg||
nt|jni33:  with a weaker hand not able to force to game South would have bid 1@d instead - showing 4+@hs|pg||
nt|jni33:  after the 1@c opening|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well bthe spade situation aso favors N as declarer|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi david :)|pg||
nt|jni33:  South might think about 5@c instead of 3nt ..or?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: since N did not bid NT directly over the doube, S might well do so|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but i think he will pass|pg||
nt|marlowepi: as little as this makes 3N right:|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Kxx   Ax   xx   QTxxxx|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N might have more :)|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|sommer:  with the same luck even 6@C makes|pg||
mb|4H|nt|jni33:  Giorgio has reached for the bidding box several times :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: on a trump lead i think you have to guess the diamonds|pg||
nt|jni33:  you are able to see that on the live streaming on Youtube at this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiulKq6zxjU|pg||
nt|jni33:  In my head I might get a thought that South has made a slamtry now .....|pg||
nt|marlowepi: assuredly|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N has an 11 count, and so bhe could have a consideraby better hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jni33:  after passing 2@s and only bidding 3@c ... then I suppose North has denied a considerably stronger hand Marshall|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i may be missing something but in slam it looks like you have to get the diamonds going, and in that respect the flimsy 2S bid by W may end up serving the defenders very well|pg||
nt|marlowepi: wel i didnt mean 19 points|pg||
pc|s7|nt|marlowepi: i meant he could have a sixth club and another card|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this hand wil require some thight|pg||
pc|d6|nt|marlowepi: thought|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dQ|nt|marlowepi: but i predict he will essentially just concede two diamonds before paying trumps|pg||
nt|sommer:  the only lead, which sets 6@C is a @H. It takes away an important transport to hand for 11 tricks only ..guess for +1 here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this hand is tricky both in the bidding and the play but rates to be more or less a push. Or as we say in Croatian: "koliko trud za nista" (so much work for nothing)|pg||
nt|jni33:  West is thinking a lot here .... do you know the EW carding Marshall? ... what is @d2?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: standard count i think|pg||
nt|jni33:  if count ...then is it a even or odd?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: odd|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi Povl. I assume you are referring to a double-dummy analysis? In practice it seems N would be likely to pay the overcaler for both diamond honors rather than try to ruff out Kcc ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in the silent E hand|pg||
nt|jni33:  in the closed room 6@c went down on a @s lead .... West had bid 1@s (after 1@c - pass - 1@d)|pg||
nt|sommer:  sure|pg||
nt|jni33:  and declared tried to finesse @d AK in the West hand |pg||
nt|marlowepi: well the fate of my prediction heps explain why i shunned the profession of soothsayer|pg||
nt|sommer:  the restrickted choice, will make you miss the @Hposition|pg||
nt|sommer:  after this long thought in W, N will NOT play for both H in W;)|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|marlowepi: one might apply restricted choice in a local club game, but in this event it would mean next to nothing that W wins first diamond with ace|pg||
nt|jni33:  @d2 might not be count then?|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|sommer:  does he have both?:)..nope|pg||
pc|dA|pc|c5|pc|d7|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s9|pc|c4|pc|s2|pg||

pc|d3|pc|h4|pc|c9|pg||
nt|pilogen:  That settles it|pg||
pc|d4|nt|dagold:  this type of deal illustrates how difficult it is to defend when you simply dont know what declarer has|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dK|pc|d5|pg||
nt|dagold:  Bocchi has yealded the contract here|pg||
nt|dagold:  he must have felt diego could not have heart acefor his switch|pg||

mc|9|nt|dagold:  so a big chance for JT3 to reclaim the lead|pg||

pc|c3|pc|c7|pc|c2|nt|sommer:  a red squeeze vs E is possible (as I see it)|pg||
nt|ady: east may have problems later holding 4 in both red suits|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe, if EW are cooperative on defense and take aces early on|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|sommer:  S can duck a @H by himself..2@S tricks are possible too|pg||
nt|marlowepi: since the aces are both in 3 card holdings it is a bit more likely that they might do so,, but in general it is stronger defense to duck aces early|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c5|pc|cJ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|sommer:  run @S' twice will produce 2@S tricks, right?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W might have ducked the second club, too, to try to control when the fourth round of that suit would be played and thus maybe protect his partner from pressure|pg||
