mb|3C|mb|3S|nt|bettinakal:  again notice non vul aggressive bidding for North|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cA|nt|bettinakal:  that 4card @h suit looks only like a 3 carder, so nobody cares about that suit|pg||

mb|1S|mb|2H|nt|bettinakal:  this is a 1@d opening, IMO ....an other story if P was a passed hand|pg||
nt|bettinakal:  looks like EW play this bid as non forcing  2@h...do have a lot of advanges to play like that|pg||
mb|3N|mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4D|nt|bettinakal:  but when playing negative DBL's you have to dbl first, bcs 2@h shows 5+@h and 10+hcp...so dbl first and then bid @h is weak and many @H in negative dbls|pg||
mb|5C|mb|d|nt|bettinakal:  I guess 3NT is not natural....|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|nt|bettinakal:  both sides can make 11 tricks with their good fitting hands|pg||

pc|h3|pc|hQ|pc|hA|pc|h6|pg||
nt|bettinakal:  the problematic suit (in this safe good contract)  is @S....When S shown @d, best chance in @s is to play S for either both big @s or a tophonour second|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pc|d6|pc|d9|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c2|pc|cA|pc|c5|pg||

mb|3C|mb|p|nt|bettinakal:  the Dbl from South = @s   seems they would bid 1@S denying @s, just show points|pg||
nt|lusobrasil: Hi again  everybody|pg||
nt|lusobrasil: 144,91  Come Farsi |pg||
nt|bettinakal:  N is counting losers on hands like this....11 cards in 2 suits...HCP doesnt work well on strong distributional hands|pg||

nt|lusobrasil: 128,07  Double Dutch |pg||

pc|hA|nt|bettinakal:  with 4@c card|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|pg||
nt|bettinakal:  if @cK onside looks like 3 aces and 5 tricks in clubs.....now when @cK is wrong, this contract need a lot of help from the defence|pg||
