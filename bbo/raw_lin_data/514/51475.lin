mb|p|mb|p|nt|lmilne:  Good afternoon to Nick Jacob from NZ, an Open level representative at the last Bermuda Bowl|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  he plays on the vulnerability a little - if partner bids, he is usually happy. however, when partner passes, as here, he's not thrilled|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c7|nt|lmilne:  I think he was expecting it to be often taken out at these colours|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  although 990 feels like a dreadful result, the double only cost 1 IMP. the lead was the difference|pg||
nt|rogerclee:  well, it is still pretty difficult to go down on a club lead|pg||
nt|lmilne:  Sadly we don't have the play from the other table due to the technical problem|pg||
nt|rogerclee:  so not sure how that result was achieved but it will mean singapore will win a large pickup|pg||

nt|lmilne:  7 tricks for the defence here: 4 clubs, 2 spades, and the king of diamonds|pg||

nt|bjacobs:  hi there|pg||
nt|lmilne:  Declarer will have to make something of the clubs here. He will be thinking about ruffing the third club high, but worried about hearts 4-1|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  I guess first Whibley has to avoid playing a spade or a diamond, which would provide the second discard|pg||
nt|vugraphzdy: I haven't missed the play - it just hasnt happened yet!|pg||

mb|1D|mb|1H|nt|vugraphzdy: Is that over all 3 zones?|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|lmilne:  Otherwise, 2nd through 5th (excluding Australia and New Zealand who are from another zone) play off for two more spots for the Bermuda Bowl/Venice Cup/Seniors' Bowl.|pg||
nt|lmilne:  No, just Zone 6. Zone 7 is just Australia and NZ this time so two free spots. I won't comment on the fairness of it|pg||
nt|rogerclee:  small point of interest on the previous hand for non-expert players is that it is a good play problem on entry management|pg||

nt|lmilne:  I know Ron Klinger plays 2@C any invite, 2@D any GF responding to 1M, which might be something similar to here|pg||
nt|rogerclee:  their convention card says "2@C = inv ask" but i don't have any details|pg||

nt|lmilne:  OK, sorry for my lack of faith. John Yoon is pretty reliable in the operator's seat|pg||
nt|rogerclee:  not the line i would have expected but i think the singleton 9 of spades will mean declarer must still come to 3 spades and a heart here|pg||
nt|lmilne:  GIB thinks this is making, still|pg||
nt|vugraphzdy: although i did swap spots on 4@s earlier|pg||
nt|lmilne:  I think Whibley's next play will take some time|pg||
nt|vugraphzdy: He definitely looks like he's about to tank|pg||
nt|lmilne:  So, how can this go down|pg||
nt|lmilne:  Even the @S 6 is annoying|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  Yes, the spade spots are unhelpful for the defence|pg||
nt|lmilne:  Even @S 5, 6, 9, Q is fine for declarer. Heart, heart. What can Whibley do?|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  Ace and another spade to kill the heart ruff?|pg||
nt|lmilne:  And declarer makes 3 spades and the @H Ace|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|nt|rogerclee:  unintuitive counter if whibley had been dealt the 9 of spades in the 6-card ending -- @SA and a LOW spade would be down 1|pg||
nt|rogerclee:  i believe|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|lmilne:  Length in the opponent's suit often a danger, and Whibley listens to the omens. This time partner has four trumps and a singleton for him, however|pg||

nt|lmilne:  Some Australian pairs switch the meanings of the 2@C and 2@H rebid with the weak hand, so North will have either shown 5/4 with clubs or 6+H depending on the variant|pg||

mb|2H|nt|vugraphzdy: I was looking at another table - don't know if this is some both majors thing or just natural|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  Well we have some experience with this :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  Why are E/W always not vul versus vul?|pg||
nt|lmilne:  Japan has dropped to 3rd as China are storming against Kuwait|pg||
nt|lmilne:  If NZ manage to hold the lead for another 8 rounds, this will be Whibley's year|pg||
nt|rogerclee:  5@Hx might be a bit undignified if they get there|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|bjacobs:  They deserve favouritism.  I believe in last year's World Open Teams, NZ were the only team from this competition to make the final rounds|pg||
nt|rogerclee:  5@Dx is better but brown might be unwilling to sit for it with a singleton|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lmilne:  And they beat the number one qualifiers, France who were European champions. Over a long match too|pg||
nt|rogerclee:  but probably should|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs:  What do you think of South's decision?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdy: I suspect I just heard whibley say "he's normally got five"|pg||
pc|d5|nt|bjacobs:  Or non-decision|pg||
nt|lmilne:  Brown will need to finesse here to have much of a chance|pg||
nt|lmilne:  Well, Lam refused to be pushed. I am sure some would bid 4@S. It's scary at the colours|pg||
nt|lmilne:  But of course you might be getting robbed|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  I'm sure I'm resulting, but the three small hearts ... partner might be short there?|pg||

nt|lmilne:  It looks like Brown is triyng to set up a couple of clubs to cash and then start ruffing, I think|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  It's an incredibly tough position for South, but he's lost a vulnerable game|pg||

nt|lmilne:  Yes. Sometimes you need to let yourself be pushed. Chalk this one up to the system|pg||
nt|lmilne:  70% system for the problem, 30% south for passing|pg||
