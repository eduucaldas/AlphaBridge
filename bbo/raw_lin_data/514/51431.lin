nt|lmilne:  My guess is 6@S-1, 13 IMPs to Australia. Not because I am partisan, but because Mill would never lead the @D Ace and it would likely go down|pg||
nt|lmilne:  On a trump lead, declarer has lots of trouble. The second heart and diamond get ruffed. There are not enough tricks unless declarer draws trumps and somehow makes something of the diamonds|pg||
