nt|nick jacob:  so a fast start for New Zealand. There's a chance for Australia to pick up on this board though - a diamond lead would shoot 3NT|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  impossible to find on this auction|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  let's step back to the first board, Roger|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  what do you reckon about the E/W auction?|pg||
nt|rogerclee:  sort of a miracle layout to be honest as the north hand lacks an entry so west has the time to build his necessary side suit trick|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  declarer might be tempted to try to sneak a heart trick in before playing clubs|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c2|pc|c7|pc|cK|pg||

nt|nick jacob:  but instead he takes the straightforward approach and will be rewarded|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|h5|pg||
pc|cA|nt|nick jacob:  my feeling about board 15 is that E/W revealed too much during the auction. To recap, they had a 2-way Checkback start, where 2@D over 1NT asked for major suit length|pg||

pc|cT|pc|d6|pc|h7|pc|h2|pg||

nt|nick jacob:  had they been able to bid 2@C (puppeting 2@D) before jumping to 3NT (showing 5332 and a choice of games) it would have been more tempting to lead a spade as north|pg||
pc|c8|pc|d8|pc|s8|nt|nick jacob:  this has become very interesting|pg||
nt|rogerclee:  don't think whibley would have led a spade in any case, seems like bad technique with hearts known to be behavingly poorly, which generally calls for passivity |pg||

nt|nick jacob:  of diamonds|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  and the lead of the @D8 precludes South from holding a singleton|pg||
nt|rogerclee:  normal technique would have been to play a diamond up at once, planning to ruff a diamond in the east hand and then drawing trumps, later poking around for the overtrick|pg||

pc|dA|nt|nick jacob:  even better if you have a way to show 5M and 3oM directly|pg||

nt|nick jacob:  Thomson had a difficult lead problem. without information he would have led the @DA with no problem, but with the information about South's diamonds, he had to decide between a trump lead, the @HJ lead or the natural diamond lead|pg||

nt|nick jacob:  well Liam, I was going to call you Nostradamus before based on your prediction powers, but now you've outdone yourself :)|pg||

nt|rogerclee:  another line of play is heart ducked, diamond ruffed with the ace, 9 of spades -- down 1|pg||

nt|lmilne:  you don't know the diamonds are 5-2|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  don't you? cashing the second diamond is a bit of a strange play|pg||
nt|lmilne:  You can guess but West might defend the same way with less diamonds and still the @S Queen bare|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  sorry, strange play if he doesn't have a doubleton|pg||
nt|lmilne:  West played 5, 8 in diamonds|pg||
nt|rogerclee:  not too big as you can still make if east has @SQxxx on a trump coup most of the time if that is the layout|pg||
nt|lmilne:  from J9875|pg||
nt|rogerclee:  and you need to play someone for the @SQ anyway|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  but on 5-8|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  he would give a diamond ruff|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  if he was looking at four diamonds himself|pg||
nt|lmilne:  true|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  I think Beauchamp's 5-8 signal can only be from a doubleton or 5|pg||
nt|lmilne:  Thomson might have led K, A with doubleton diamond as well|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  this is true|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  but based on what we have seen I think they have kept their agreements to a minimum|pg||
nt|lmilne:  East led a heart at the other table|pg||
nt|lmilne:  so this is flat or a swing out for NZ|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  looks like they're only in 2@S|pg||
nt|rogerclee:  minor argument against ruffing high and playing the 9 of spades is you might go down 2, cant afford to cash the AK of clubs pitching a diamond first since you need to preserve the club entry for a hypothetical trump coup|pg||
pc|s9|nt|nick jacob:  the difference in 1NT ranges meant that Peake did not invite on the South cards|pg||
