mb|4S|mb|p|nt|nick jacob:  my guess is that N/S play 1@S as forcing|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  this hand is a little unlucky for their system. Being able to jump-shift into 2@S would make Margaret Bourke love her hand in support|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  instead she has to choose the practical approach of showing her values and shape with 2NT|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  I think Sue Lusk could try 3@S over 2NT. I would imagine that should be forcing|pg||

nt|nick jacob:  at some stage, North will win the @SK, play a diamond to her partner, who will probably cash the @HK to get a count card, the @HA, and give a club ruff for down 2|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|nick jacob:  at the other table, South made a very wimpy 3@D overcall. I don't really understand that at this vulnerability. I would be closer to overcalling 5@D|pg||

nt|nick jacob:  it is important for E/W to bounce back after that. They haven't had a bad set by any means. 21 was a normal result and 20 is a very good grand slam.|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  I don't think natural 4NT has enough utility, but your mileage may vary|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  not saying it should be RKCB but you are at a very high level and need to resolve strain and level for three suits|pg||

nt|nick jacob:  as little as the @SJ or @S10 would be enough for the promotion|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  this is an excellent slam for North/South|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  however entries are slightly difficult for stripping the hand|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  the club lead gives the required extra entry|pg||
mb|4C|an|  |mb|d|nt|nick jacob:  but a heart lead prevents stripping out the hand, finishing in South to take a spade finesse|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  obviously on this hand it is necessary to strip the hand and play a spade from North|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  but on many layouts this would fail|pg||
mb|r!|mb|p|nt|fabsayc:  i was looking at that, i think your right, nick, all a bit double dummy however|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  if Jacob were to lead a heart, one successful line would involve stripping out clubs and leaving the third heart. with East holding a doubleton, she has no heart to return upon winning the first round of spades|pg||
mb|4D!|mb|p|mb|5C!|mb|p|nt|nick jacob:  The pass over 1@D looks a bit surprising. They cannot bid 3@C which would show an intermediate Jump. as a result it looks like 2@C or 4@C. I would just overcall 2@C|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  spec helpfully pointed out that East can just return a club after the strip|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|nick jacob:  the ruff and discard doesn't help declarer. She only has one trump in dummy to ruff a spade, and they don't break|pg||
