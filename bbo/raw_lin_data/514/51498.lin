mb|1D|mb|1H|nt|bjacobs:  I don't know E/W, but N/S are a long-standing highly rated partnership: Denny Sacul and Frankie Karwur|pg||

nt|vugraphzdy: K Yamada appeared on vugraph on the first day of this tournament|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  The key to this hand is right now.  South needs to continue diamonds, otherwise he may get endplayed|pg||
nt|kaz08833:  hehe i played very poorly that time :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  The question is: could North hold @D763?  That @D10 falsecard may have been timely |pg||
nt|kaz08833:  bill it's easy|pg||
nt|kaz08833:  there is an asking play|pg||

nt|vugraphzdy: They have written "same"|pg||
nt|vugraphzdy: But dont know if they have special agreements here|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  So there you go.  As it turned out, West might have been better off dropping the @D3|pg||
mb|2C|an|11-15, 6+!c or 5!c4M|nt|bjacobs:  That feels consistent with North having @D1076.  It's a subtle game|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|pc|c9|nt|bjacobs:  Interesting play problem here|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  Should South attack hearts or diamonds?  Or can he do both?|pg||
nt|kaz08833:  2NT will go down if EW find S trikcs|pg||

pc|dK|pc|d4|pc|d3|nt|kaz08833:  now down 1 at least|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  I think this is the righut play by Karwur.  He doesn't know that E/W have 4 spades, they may not have.  And now he can duck a heart, and hope to lose only 5 tricks in total|pg||
nt|kaz08833:  but there might be some problem W shd find their S tricks|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  4 spades tricks, I mean|pg||
nt|vugraphzdy: E/W play natural signals and discards|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h4|pc|h7|pc|h9|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  Whereas if he had attacked hearts with the @HA and @HK (with diamonds in reserve), he was open to losing 3 spades, 2 hearts and 1 diamond|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  should hearts prove to be 4-1|pg||
nt|kaz08833:  another asking play, CASH SA|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  Yes, perhaps West should get this one right, if he can visualize South's 5-card heart suit|pg||
nt|kaz08833:  if S has only 4H NS doesnt have 8 tricks|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|pc|hQ|pc|h3|pg||
