mb|3D|nt|cuttysark: Some sort of game try|pg||
nt|dburn:  3@d may be an attempt to get a heart lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|nt|dburn:  or, it may be an honest "I need help in diamonds"|pg||
mb|4S|nt|cuttysark: It's a god enough game - heart finesse or @DH10 onside |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Good|pg||
nt|dburn:  or it may be natural, but that is always a last desperate resort in this pair's methods|pg||

nt|dburn:  at any rate, Bell raised it in case it was natural, and East led what he was always going to lead anyway|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Looks like a help suit game try to me, but I bow to your superior knowledge|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|dburn:  so far so bad, but declarer won't have given up hope yet - the diamond position could be favourable|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Robson switched to @SA other at this point|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c7|pc|s9|nt|dburn:  very reasonable - but it looks as though East can actually play anything at all and still beat the hand (maybe @cJ would be unusccessful)|pg||

nt|dburn:  no, there isn't|pg||
nt|dburn:  at least, not yet|pg||
nt|vugraphzea: if east had ducked @S then @DA not play @DQ @H and now spade would endplay E.  But didnt happen :>|pg||

nt|cuttysark: I am expecting a 7 imp gain for the baddies|pg||

nt|dburn:  here, 3NT was not as good a spot as 4@s by some way|pg||

pc|h9|nt|dburn:  somewhat speculative opening lead, this|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Deceptive, but thinks hearts are breaking nicely|pg||
nt|dburn:  declarer, of course, won't know that it's from this holding, so will not necessarily be able to capitalize|pg||
