mb|1H|mb|p|nt|pjs_ch:  Wales are fighting to get started in this competition, having lost all four stanzas to date|pg||
mb|p|nt|pjs_ch:  Ireland also lost their first two stanzas - to Scotland, whom WBU trounced in the last match|pg||
mb|2C|nt|pjs_ch:  NS play a Polish-club style, where 1@H is a 5cd major but limited to about 17 hcp|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|pjs_ch:  which allows North to pass in this case|pg||
mb|2D|mb|4C|nt|pjs_ch:  East has quite a strong overcall here and must expect the opponents to have a hidden|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  spade fit when his partner hasn't bid the suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|pjs_ch:  few of us woudl actually have kept quiet with West's hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|sK|nt|pjs_ch:  looks like it might be one too high here, and 3@C on the second round would have shown a good hand too|pg||

nt|pjs_ch:  the count signal (@S2) has told Hugh not to expect any more tricks there|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  usually this @H2 would be a suit preference card  but here he hardly wants partner to play diamonds|pg||

mb|2S|mb|4H|nt|iain sime:  Sorry, Ireland now lead.|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|iain sime:  4@H a transfer to 4@S by the opposition here (unless opener has < 3 spades).|pg||
mb|d|nt|iain sime:  3@H would have given a problem.|pg||

nt|pjs_ch:  B16|pg||
mb|p|nt|pjs_ch:  we have started with boards 15-16 here to allow the other room to get ahead, and to give us|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  comparisons when we get to our third board (B1)|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|2H|nt|pjs_ch:  1@C opener here is either a weak NT hand or a strong hand, presumably the former|pg||
mb|2S|mb|3H|nt|pjs_ch:  2@h is primarily preemptive but does take vulnerability into account|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pjs_ch:  4@S here is a two way shot, might make or might be a good sacrifice|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  it's going to turn out a close thing, since declarer has 3 clear losers and must just guess the clubs to make game|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s7|pc|s3|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  the spade an heart shape will be visible to declarer so it will depend on whether he cn|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  can pick up the diamond shape from the carding of the opponents|pg||
pc|d2|nt|pjs_ch:  it will be hard work to hide the shape, and here the fourth best diamond lead is a big indicator|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  the contract would have been off by force (tks, A) on a heart lead and a club switch|pg||
nt|pjs_ch:  imagine leading your partner's suit to beat the contract !!|pg||
