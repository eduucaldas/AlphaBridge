mb|3S|mb|p|nt|Schafer:  3@S by Hamman?|pg||
nt|Schafer:  Not 2@S|pg||
nt|kareno: I would play that as a splinter|pg||
nt|Schafer:  Right|pg||
mb|4S|nt|Schafer:  I can't imagin they aren't playing 2/1|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kareno: Hope their understandings are clear.  Apparently yes|pg||
pc|h3|nt|Schafer:  Well, not that good.  They missed a pretty good slam, didn't they?|pg||
nt|kareno: I don't know what they're playing - but it's not necessarily 2/1.  Maybe strong club...|pg||
nt|Schafer:  He might cash @SAK then try ruffing finesse and make 5 but it's a good slam.|pg||
