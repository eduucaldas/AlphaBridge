mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|reisig: Bid more ..or not?|pg||
nt|kareno: 3@s shows 4@s and 5@h.  It gets hearts declared by the strong hand if there's a fit|pg||
pc|d8|nt|kareno: I would not.  This is a game of tricks and overtricks and NEVER putting a board out of reach|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d6|pc|d2|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d3|pc|dQ|pc|d7|pg||
nt|phil:  they also pay a slam bonus at MPs and BAM too - South's hand is awfully good for hearts|pg||
pc|dA|pc|h5|nt|kareno: He could have cuebid under game that might have gotten north to cooperate.|pg||
pc|h9|pc|d4|pg||
nt|reisig: J109xx ...is not Jxxxx|pg||
nt|phil:  yeah - North would jump on the slam bandwagon after 4@d|pg||
pc|h2|nt|reisig: We just judge in diff ways|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
nt|kareno: South I mean - after 3@s could have made a move in diamonds.  |pg||
pc|dJ|pc|h7|nt|reisig: Not enough ..in my opinion (for 4@d)|pg||
pc|hT|pc|dK|pg||
nt|phil:  I dont think 3N over 2N is particularly crazy either|pg||
nt|kareno: I didn't say 'should,' I said 'could.'|pg||
nt|reisig: Did someone say ..the bar is open?|pg||
nt|phil:  only in certain counties RR :)|pg||
nt|reisig: ROFL|pg||

nt|jrssd: BTW - pls ask Q or make comments, as these vugraphs are for YOU!|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|pc|h4|nt|jrssd: if South were really lucky, he's make 7|pg||
nt|jrssd: but even 6 was not a good slam|pg||
nt|jrssd: well, maybe 6N by North|pg||
nt|jrssd: yes, 6N by N is a good spot - no worse than picking up the Hearts|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s2|pc|sA|pc|s8|pg||

pc|cT|nt|Vugraphzfh: yes barometer|pg||
nt|reisig: The players can't "know" the scores ...so we don't either|pg||
nt|phil:  I dont think there is a running total, but if there's an ambitious kibitzer keeping track, please pass along the score|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c4|pc|cA|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s5|pc|sT|nt|kareno: Geoff Hampson makes a neutral lead - doesn't want to give up anything on defense.|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|reisig: Tough ..from here ...I'd play @d 7|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: Greco into the tank|pg||
nt|kareno: I've gotten at least two conflicting answers so we'll have to wait for something concrete.  Apparently teams can compare between rounds which means they would know how they are ...|pg||
nt|kareno: doing.|pg||
nt|phil:  I predict he will shift to the beer|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfh: it is true they have been comparing beteen rounds|pg||

nt|phil:  pretty unusual - you generally dont have time to breathe between rounds|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cK|pc|c3|pc|c9|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c2|nt|kareno: Hamman makes a deceptive play, starting spades, the opposition's best suit|pg||

pc|c6|pc|s4|pc|d8|pc|d5|pg||
nt|reisig: This is ..not clear cut!|pg||
nt|kareno: USBF will publish standings after the session.|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jrssd: ah, I'm told that NS play Smolen over 2N|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h3|pc|hQ|nt|jrssd: so 3@S showed 4@S, 5@H|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|jrssd: running clubs wd squeeze the South hand|pg||
nt|jrssd: so I thk decl will play @Ds|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|pc|c5|pc|c2|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cT|pc|cK|nt|jrssd: South cd run the clubs, discarding Spades, but then the defenders wd play Spades to squeexe South|pg||

pc|cQ|pc|c4|pc|d9|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|jrssd: but I'm wrong|pg||

mb|2S|mb|p|nt|kareno: Specs are all cute - can't answer each when the comments come in so fast but :)|pg||
mb|3D!|mb|p|nt|kareno: Spec says, 'and bob hamman said if someone had to play as declarer for his life he would have picked Meyer Schleiffer'|pg||
mb|4C!|nt|reisig: I'd pick someone else :)|pg||
nt|kareno: I played once with 'the butcher' and he was a fabulous player and a very nice man.|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kareno: He got that nickname at the bridge club in LA where he would answer the phone, 'butcher shop.'|pg||
pc|cK|nt|kareno: And a LOT of hands got butchered in that rubber bridge club :)|pg||

mb|2C|nt|jrssd: does anyone know the EW range at this vul?|pg||
nt|jrssd: good lord - that's a sort of terrible bid - everyone cover your eyes|pg||
mb|4C|nt|jrssd: it won't matter on THIS hand, but wow|pg||
mb|5C|nt|jrssd: of course I shd know - I invented "Schuler Doubes", and I WOULD make a Schuler Double with the South hand|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|jrssd: west will pull |pg||
nt|jrssd: but I've been wrong a lot today|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jrssd: will W cue 5@D on the way, so to speak|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d6|pc|dT|pc|dA|pg||
nt|jrssd: so this will be down 500, to lose the board the opps wd have to bid the slam|pg||
nt|jrssd: this cd work out fine for EW, because the probalble slam of 6@H is beaten by the @S lead|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|pc|s8|pc|c2|pg||
nt|jrssd: as expected, the FINE defense on the last hand won the board for EW|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|pc|dJ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|jrssd: interestingly, South attacked spades, and got the opps to play @Ds!|pg||
nt|jrssd: this must be the last hand|pg||
pc|s9|pc|c8|nt|jrssd: tks for the Q and comments - I wish the discussion were open when there's only one commentator...|pg||
