nt|jrssd: very rude of Lauria to bid South's long suit|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|medwards: Forced South into nebulus action|pg||
nt|jrssd: will EW find the @C fit?|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|medwards: So lost Opportunity for E-W|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dQ|pc|dA|nt|jrssd: I could see 5@C MAKING by East|pg||
nt|jrssd: if South tried to cash a 2nd @H|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|medwards: Possible but Ralph in a very good defender|pg||
nt|jrssd: yes, and North will give a LENGTH signal|pg||
nt|medwards: Yes|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cQ|pc|cK|pc|c4|pg||
nt|jrssd: this would be a standard Count situation|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  South too flat and no 4-card major - plus vulnerable facing passed partner|pg||
mb|p|pc|c7|nt|yorkbeach:  as expected same result in other room on 1|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  declarer confident of 6 tricks - plus chance of 7 if @sK with South and break friendly|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if South had K-8 or K-9 doubleton, option to finesse on 3rd @s|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  here there do not seem to be any sensible losing options in the spade suit|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cJ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  playing on diamonds is likely to give the defenders a 3rd @d trick|pg||

pc|cT|pc|c3|pc|cA|pc|c5|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jrssd: if anyone wd be tempted to Dbl with the South hand, it's a really bad idea|pg||
nt|jrssd: no major, 3334|pg||
pc|s9|nt|medwards: Looks like four heart tricks squeezing dummy|pg||
nt|jrssd: Is it too early for anyone to ask Q? That's what the commentator are here for!|pg||
nt|medwards: But no! strange lead|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|sT|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|medwards: Just because the suit is bid dooes not mean you can not lead it|pg||
nt|jrssd: North didn't want to break any suits (where he held unsupported honors)|pg||
nt|medwards: So declarer does it.|pg||
nt|jrssd: BTW, a Club lead would be the worst, do you agree Mike?|pg||
nt|medwards: Yes it acomplishes nothing|pg||
nt|jrssd: sometimes there's truth in old bridge sayings: "Only hacks lead from Jacks"|pg||
nt|medwards: Very true |pg||
nt|jrssd: and a lead from an unsupported Jack is Very likely to give up a trick|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s5|pc|s7|pg||
nt|medwards: Is this a Zia play?|pg||
nt|jrssd: Jeff Meckstroth does this a LOT|pg||
nt|medwards: South killing entries to WEst's hearts.|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s4|pc|sJ|pc|s8|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  EW could get into trouble here|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if Seamon raises to 2@h and Levin X|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|reisig: I'll bet he Passes over 2@H!!|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  vulnerable nad facing a pssed partner, Levin goes quietly|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  non vul would probably have been in auction|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|reisig: Trump lead is normal|pg||
pc|s9|nt|yorkbeach:  yes if you are expecting dummy to have exactly three trumps and a ruffing value|pg||
nt|reisig: Maybe .... I'm not :)|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  West likely to have scattered values because if his values were concentrated in one suit he might have opened in 3rd seat|pg||

nt|Vugraphzff: plus a slight mistep on defense (pitching a diamond)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|medwards: Yes|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|jrssd: with 3 low Clubs I don't think North will try for NT|pg||
nt|medwards: Apparently, there are no running scores|pg||
nt|jrssd: but we'll see|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|ahollan2: historically  there is a 1 to 2 round delay before updated leaderboard is made available|pg||
nt|medwards: THx|pg||
nt|ahollan2: then TD needs to give results to Jan who then manually enters onto  www.usbf.org|pg||
nt|medwards: 2NT maybe an ask|pg||
nt|jrssd: Thank you Al!!|pg||
nt|ahollan2: but this IS being played in Barometer format so that players are aware of their standing|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: I think it is natural.  I could have missed an alert, but I think natural is the style for this pair|pg||
nt|jrssd: Al, does your knowledge extend to this 2N bid?|pg||
mb|3D|nt|jrssd: thanks Joe :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: they know their own score (often) but not others'|pg||
nt|medwards: Thanks Joe|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzff: not even their own when either pair is running late|pg||
nt|jrssd: 3@D hints that 2N was conventional?|pg||
nt|ahollan2: sorry  2N = nat, NF   [hope that matches Joe's explanation]|pg||
