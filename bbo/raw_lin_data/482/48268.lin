mb|p|nt|jni33:  after partner passed |pg||

nt|ahollan1: i am ballast|pg||
nt|jni33:  hahaha|pg||
nt|jni33:  Tokay - Sementa in 3@s on board  16 in the other room ... making the score 1-0 Lavazza|pg||
nt|jrssd: if you suspect that there are no more winners by force, often(!) right to give the ruff-sluff, ESPECIALLY when trumps may be breaking badly|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|h6|pc|d6|nt|jrssd: perhaps, but not if big disparity in suit quality|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think strong suggestion that 4@H is 4-bagger|pg||

nt|jni33:  Dennis has moved more or less permanently to Norway ... I wonder why he left his beautyful Denmark .... might have been something very important dragging him to Norway|pg||
