nt|medwards: Yes|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: i like 1s or 4s more than michaels personally|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we thought McCallum would match Steve's 4@S|pg||
mb|4N|nt|Vugraphzfc: and michaels gets them in some trouble here|pg||
mb|p|mb|5S|nt|robinswr: this is why you don't bid Michaels with 7 spades partner is going after your minor|pg||
nt|swanson:  Can kibitzers double?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: i think S should pass 4s anyway probably though...|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: would your choice of bid for north be different if south unpassed hand?|pg||
nt|robinswr: partner should be 6-6 for his 4@s bid|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: looks like down 3 here|pg||
nt|swanson:  Declarer should lose 1 club, 1 spade, and 3 diamonds.  Lots of out cards for the defense.|pg||

nt|warrens:  I wwould have expected a strong 4225 hand|pg||
nt|ahollan2: last board of this segment|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Sokolow: "Kerri, did you have 3 @hs?" Levitina: "4"|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|warrens:  with shortness, I expect a splinter. with 18 balanced, I expect 3@S|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2S|nt|warrens:  but 4@S could also be a good 18 or 19 since partner made a free bid|pg||
nt|ahollan2: on  12  would you make negative DBL after 1N-(3@D)?|pg||
mb|p|nt|warrens:  yes I would |pg||
nt|ahollan2: does Sokolow actually think she can make 1@S?|pg||
mb|4S|an|RKC for !hs|nt|warrens:  partner rates to me short in @D, so a likely fit|pg||
nt|ahollan2: 4@S must be RKC @H|pg||
nt|ahollan2: that is one benefit of cue guaranteeing fit|pg||
nt|ahollan2: maybe other room will show us how bidding goes after   P-1@H-4@S-??|pg||
nt|warrens:  slam can be made by finessing the @C and squeezing north|pg||
nt|warrens:  only a @C avoids giving away the slam at trick one|pg||
mb|p|nt|warrens:  only 12 bad choices|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: On the earlier hand where Sanborn bid Blackwood and then 5NT, there was some laughter afterwards about the fact that she couldn't count (they were off a Keycard), so this time she ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: counted twice :)|pg||

nt|warrens:  so, big decision now|pg||
nt|warrens:  Sokolow did a perfect job of implying 7042|pg||
nt|ahollan2: can't believe 1@S and out with any of north's possible hands|pg||
nt|warrens:  and Molson held enough @D's to give the same impression|pg||
nt|warrens:  with 7051, seems like 4@S was more likely|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Sokolow did think for a very long time over 4@s and surely Sanborn knows it was she, because Levitina was just answering keycards|pg||
nt|ahollan2:  14  Baker started with 3@D rather than Seamon-Molson 1@D|pg||
nt|ahollan2: Shi-Palmer really had no chance to get past 4@S|pg||

nt|ahollan2: McCallum overcalled 2@H Michaels|pg||
nt|warrens:  I give all the credit on that one to Sokolow|pg||
nt|warrens:  if she had led a @C, I'm sure Sanborn would have made it on the squeeze endplay|pg||
nt|warrens:  if she had pitched 2 @D's, she would have made it|pg||
nt|warrens:  and if she had overcalled 2@H or 4@S, I think she would have made it|pg||
