mb|3N|mb|p|nt|bjurn:  so NS has found their @D fit|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|bjurn:  3N wasn't really what S was hoping for|pg||
nt|bjurn:  but have too good cards to be pessimistic about slam|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|6S|mb|p|nt|ahollan2: be honest   over 2@C  do you rebid 2@D or some number of @S??|pg||

mc|13|nt|bjurn:  so when both @S and @D are friendly easy 13 tricks|pg||
nt|Psyck:  it is common to show side suit when not min hand, but it is not as clear with solid 7 card @s|pg||

nt|bjurn:  it makes it easier for p to value his cards when going high|pg||
nt|bjurn:  if N didn't know about the 4c @D suit|pg||
nt|bjurn:  would he know that @DKQ was 2 tricks or maybe only 1?|pg||
nt|ahollan2:  26  tokay stopped in 4@S !!!|pg||
nt|bjurn:  a top is 50 MP per board?|pg||
nt|Walddk2:   http://www.bridgeguys.com/Conventions/exclusion_keycard_blackwood.html|pg||
nt|ahollan2: final board of the championship is  30|pg||
nt|bjurn:  well, the leading pair has 2910 MPs atm|pg||
nt|bjurn:  dividing that with 98 boards|pg||
nt|bjurn:  gives about 30|pg||
