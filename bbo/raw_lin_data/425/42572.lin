nt|debrose:  Tough decision for Ben on the first round of diamonds.  Would declarer really make that sneaky play with AKT98xx, paying off to stiff honor in South|pg||
nt|debrose:  Then again, would declarer make the play with the actual holding, which was also paying off to a stiff J or stiff Q in South|pg||

mb|1D|nt|debrose:  When you see claims, that doesn't mean there was a claim at the table at that point|pg||
nt|warrens:  almost a pure 50% slam here|pg||
nt|debrose:  It often means the vugraph operator lost track of the play - likely because it started going very fast - and didn't record the last few tricks|pg||
mb|1H|mb|d|nt|kit: A lot better than that I think Warren, taking squeeze possibilities into account.|pg||
mb|r|mb|2S|nt|debrose:  So they wait for the claim and then enter it as such.  For example, on the previous deal, declarer after drawing trump must have ruffed out the @HQ and then claimed making 6 (with the @DT as an entry).  |pg||
nt|debrose:  He didn't claim at the point we say play end|pg||
nt|debrose:  *saw* play end|pg||
nt|warrens:  squeeze chances do improve the odds, but requires reading the position.  anyway, odds went down after East opened|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|kit: Intelligent spllinter by Souht -- and could get them to slam|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|warrens:  an interesting self-splinter.  I didn't expect that.  are we 100% sure that North will understand it as such?|pg||
nt|debrose:  Yes, of course sometimes there is an actual claim at the point at which the operator claims - just not always - please no more questions and comments about this, just thought I'd share that with those who might not realize|pg||
mb|4N|nt|kit: what else could it mean?|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|mb|6H|nt|warrens:  natural, I suppose|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: Not so sure this will make in practice, as East pitches after dummy in all suits|pg||
nt|warrens:  East does seem to be guarding 3 suits (if the defense starts with 2 rounds of @d's)|pg||
nt|warrens:  declarer's 8 of @c's is the key to the hand|pg||
nt|kit: So unless declarer plays East for 4 clubs, which I don't think he will on the auction, he may take the club finesse|pg||
nt|kit: But when West shows up with KJ10 of diamonds, he may place East with queen of clubs for opening bid|pg||
pc|h3|nt|kit: Yes, we all can see that squeeze works due to 8 of clubs -- but remember, declarer isn't looking at all 4 hands|pg||
nt|warrens:  agreed.  and a @c shift by the defense kills the squeeze anyway.  I think declarer will win this in hand and play a @d|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hT|nt|kit: There is a line which makes when East has any Qxx of clubs|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|kit: Run all hearts, cash ace of spades, cross to ace of clubs, and throw East in with king of spades|pg||
