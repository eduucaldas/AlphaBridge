nt|ahollan1: on the actual auction is it double dummy to hear 4@C-PASS?  opener figures to have short @S which means 2 or 3 @H|pg||
nt|kit: But here with West known to have long hearts that is very unlikely|pg||

mb|1S!|mb|3D|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: not sure why there was a U21 Playoff -- i thought only ONE U21 team going to 2016 World Championships|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Possibly the USBF realizes that specific placing (that is, Koppel being 3rd place/Olsen 2nd) may be helpful in the college admissions process|pg||
nt|debrose:  Al, there was a playoff for 3rd place - I don't know for sure why, but I speculated on the reason earlier today|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Plus, it's just not satisfying to go home with that ambiguous "3rd/4th place" moniker|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: ;)|pg||
mb|p|nt|debrose:  The USBF does not usually have a 3rd place playoff in a trials.  However, since all these very young players were in Atlanta anyway, it seems to make sense to give them the experience of another big match|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i was just thinking   good experience|pg||
mb|p|pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: right Debbie -- kept the kids from playing in the streets|pg||

nt|debrose:  As I told some Europeans earlier, since we are so spread out in the US, it's hard to get people together in one place for live training and practice|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cK|nt|ahollan1: pictures of winners will be displayed  at  http://usbf.org/index.php|pg||
nt|debrose:  All these kids participate in the USBF online junior training program, but it is rare that they get to practice live with coaches present|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't there also a U16 team going to Italy? The playoff may  help determine who to send.|pg||
