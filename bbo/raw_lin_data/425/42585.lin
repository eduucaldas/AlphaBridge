nt|dendac1:  oh wait! the auction isnt over|pg||

nt|dendac1:  greg gets a D lead, but 9 toppers|pg||
nt|debrose:  Especially if they suspect they are far behind in the match, redouble seems like it might have good imp odds going for it|pg||

nt|dendac1:  4Sx looks 800 if they run|pg||
nt|debrose:  That may well be the case, but what I meant is that from North's point of view, it's hard to see how W can have a hand that knows he's beating this, as opposed to gambling|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|debrose:  Gambling that  a diamond lead is not only best, but good enough to beat the contract|pg||
pc|s6|nt|debrose:  anyway, it doesn't seem like E thought it called for a diamond lead|pg||
nt|dendac1:  greg didnt know he was beating it, just thought D was best shot.  didnt consider that north had a blue card in his box|pg||
