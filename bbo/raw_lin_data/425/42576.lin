mb|p|mb|1H|an|5+ 10-15|nt|ahollan1: best reason - it goes down|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H = 10-15|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: A flat board, which Kaplan-Brescoll can't complain about.|pg||
nt|vugraphzff: One of the best precision auctions |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@H = very wide range   but i thought Kaplan would take different approach with his collection|pg||
nt|kit: pretty hard to imagine a slam opposite a limited opening bid.  What could partner have?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|kit: And if no slam, what contract other that 4@H?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: because 1@H is limited, big clubbers can jump 1M-4M with normal preempt or even opening bid with 3-fit and no slam ambition|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d9|pc|d4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i was thinking possibilities opposite short @C   but maybe needs too much of a perfecta|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and there 1M-2N = INV+  so that may complicate ability to learn all that must be known|pg||
nt|ahollan1: THEIR|pg||

mb|2S|mb|3S|nt|vugraphzff: 4@H appears to be going down on continuous @H leads|pg||
