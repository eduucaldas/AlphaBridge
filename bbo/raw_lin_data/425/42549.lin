mb|4S|mb|5H|nt|vugraphzfd: i am not sure about the convention cards, but you can view their system summary forms here |pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: http://usbf.org/index.php?option=com_entries&event=43&task=list|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|OosmanB: Dbl by Kevin was snapdragon / fourth suit double|pg||
nt|OosmanB: A useful convention, but it 5@h might not be a good "save" as the hand is|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: the live video link is not available at the moment|pg||

nt|OosmanB: For perhaps newer players and juniors, Rosenberg here isn't really bidding 5@H because he think it'll make, he likely thinks its down just 1 or 2 tricks, and a score of -100 / -300 ...|pg||
nt|OosmanB: would be a gain against their very likely 420|pg||
