mb|5S|mb|p|mb|5N|mb|p|nt|jacksond:  When West had top two clubs and Spade Ace it was certain that East had a heart control for 5C|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Can make 7 by squeezing S in red suits? Very unlikely that Nickell would lead a diamond, but does that break it up?|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfg: right now director is called and consulted by S|pg||
nt|jacksond:  Given that EW in other room missed  the small slam this is a big board.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: before 7C bid, E called and talked with director, and than with N|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: they are away from the table, so I can't hear what is discussed|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: S is back, thinking what to do|pg||
nt|jacksond:  So maybe Les will have to make 7 and then have it corrected to 6C +1. That would be a freeroll for NS|pg||

mb|d|nt|jacksond:  I dont think there can be an adjusment to the contract now that South has bid 7H. Is that correct?|pg||

nt|kareno:  Good 6@c here for e/w|pg||
nt|ritong: weinstein's hand is really good|pg||
nt|kareno:  4@s by east would cement the slam|pg||
nt|ritong: he might make another move than a simple raise|pg||
nt|fuquay:  If E bids strongly they might even sniff toward a grand slam (which would be unsuccessful)|pg||
nt|kareno:  Can south get caught in a red suit squeeze?|pg||

nt|kareno:  I think I got there first :)|pg||
nt|ritong: but what is his pard's hand to pick 5@c so brutally?|pg||
nt|fuquay:  Although that is playing S for KQJ@H and @DK while a finesse requires only @DK with N|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfk: the lead may clarify the heart position|pg||
nt|fuquay:  Of course (we have active spectators today), we really want to play 7@C by E since this prevents a killing @D lead|pg||
nt|kareno:  And would n/s save again?|pg||
nt|fuquay:  If NS save, I guess that they would go down 4 but misjudged defense could make it less|pg||
nt|fuquay:  That would be down 4 at 6 --- a save of 5@S would go down 3|pg||
nt|ritong: how would you envision pard's hand after 5@c, guys?|pg||
