mb|3S|nt|fabsayc:  how high will this go|pg||
nt|shuster:  Some players use "Non-leaping Michaels" here|pg||
nt|shuster:  where a 4m overcall would show that suit and hearts|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|shuster:  Without that tool, I'd be hesitant to bid 4@D, favoring 5@D as a two-way shot.|pg||

nt|shuster:  thats why 1@S on 28|pg||
nt|shuster:  Strangely, North PASSED in the other room|pg||
nt|MrAce:  now 5@D is slam inv with @D control while 5@H would be same without @D control I believe |pg||

nt|fabsayc:  what about Hammans 2nt|pg||
nt|shuster:  Its decidedly an underbid, even if their range includes 22|pg||
nt|shuster:  6H looks to be a favorite on an unobstructed auction.  Had North preempted diamonds, that would make the club hook more likely to succeed, but also increase the likelyhood of 5-2 spades offside and 3-1 hearts offside.|pg||
mb|4D|nt|shuster:  Berk is considering whether to texas or transfer-raise, a mild slam try|pg||
mb|d|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|shuster:  seems he has settled on Texas.|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|2C|mb|2D|nt|shuster:  this is quite a swing board.  The result in the other room being 50 for E/W... E/W will need to make a doubled contract for the match|pg||

mb|2H|mb|2S|mb|3H|nt|MrAce:  how about 4@S doubled?|pg||

nt|phil:  pretty clear to lead @sA isn't it? |pg||
nt|MrAce:  yes|pg||
nt|shuster:  yes, they have located the @SA lead for South.  In the other room spades were never rebid, so the lead would have been less obvious.|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|2C|mb|2D|mb|2H|nt|shuster:  this time the big fit is in the minors.  It is interesting to see the twists a competitive auction can take when the majors are out of the picture.|pg||

mb|3D|mb|5C|mb|5D|nt|shuster:  N/S are on for 3NT or 4@C.  E/W can make 5@D if the defense fails to find the spade ruff|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|shuster:  4@S has diffferent problems and is an interesting contract that I"m not going to waste my few remaining brain cells analyzing...|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|shuster:  Spec says you can make 5@C on an endplay.  Might be possible.  We'll see if he can do it in six to hold the damage to -1.|pg||
nt|shuster:  On these huge fitters, it is often right to bid one more rather than defend.  It is hard to lose a lot of imps for going -1 |pg||
nt|shuster:  Fredin bid one more... Now Berkowitz must consider... that if partner can't double 6@C - is it going to make?|pg||
nt|fabsayc:  could hammans pass be forcing, is not clear|pg||
mb|p|pc|dK|nt|shuster:  Its the last board and Fredin has no idea that the other room still has about 2 hours to play|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|pc|d5|pg||
