nt|shuster:  South really wanted to rebid 3NT, but North had already grabbed the NT, exposing the @CK to the lead.  I like to invert 3@S and 2NT here, so the weak hand doesn't grab the NT AND you have an extra level to explore for slam if there is a fit.|pg||

nt|shuster:  even 5-2-2-4 is a good grand, needing at most the hearts to come in|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|d|nt|fuquay:  t is a matter of probabilities --- on the hands that W has for which 7 is not cold, there is probably some play for seven|pg||
mb|p|nt|shuster:  Sign off in six is absolutely shocking.|pg||
mb|1H|nt|fuquay:  If you combine that with the chances that it is cold, the probabilities strongly favor bidding seven|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D!|an|gf 4!h|nt|fuquay:  Here 6 requires guessing hearts correctly --- they did not bid 6 in the other room|pg||
nt|shuster:  Notice Levin's simple 1@H.  There is a strong indication here that partner has an "Extra values" double and might hold non-traditional distribution.  You don't want to excite a strong by jumping.|pg||
nt|MrAce:  so NS does not play S hand as 3@H bid over dbl|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil:  yes Greg especially since he should start at looking at hypothectical 5@s (332) which are most likely and make 7 a spread|pg||
