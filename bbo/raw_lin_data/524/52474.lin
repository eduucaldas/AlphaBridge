pc|d5|pc|d7|pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|s6|pc|h8|pg||
nt|fuquay:  This will do as well --- the opponents will have to play spades|pg||

nt|fuquay:  Note that Bercuson's play of the @HQ qill not help Rodwell with the count|pg||
nt|fuquay:  There is a lesson here --- Rodwell knows this is a bad board but he still working as hard as he can to avoid losing even more IMPs|pg||
