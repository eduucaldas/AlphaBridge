nt|assault1NT:  declarer should have a complete count at that point|pg||
mb|1C|nt|assault1NT:  yes, playing diamonds immediately would result in 10 tricks|pg||

pc|dJ|pc|dQ|nt|hakanberk:  This 3NT looks untouchable (though having the QT of diamonds drop doubleton certianly helps) |pg||

pc|d8|nt|assault1NT:  low diamond is interesting, presumably trying to coax a duck from North's @d10xx|pg||

nt|assault1NT:  so, some wild swings earlier in the segment but the boards seem to have settled down|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|nt|hakanberk:  Georgia Tech has a commanding lead at this point as time is running out for Chicago. We'll see what comeback the can mount in the last few boards|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|hakanberk:  1NT here versus 3D at the other table. A tame board again but we'll see how they fare in this contract |pg||
