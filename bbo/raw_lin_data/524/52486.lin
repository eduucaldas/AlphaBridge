nt|fuquay:  yes|pg||
nt|phil:  many play 3@h to show 5-4 in the minors and 3 in the other major. Hanlon's hand is perfect for that|pg||

mb|4N|nt|MrAce:  yes, had W held void, knowing which red Ace E has could be important|pg||

mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|mb|6C|mb|p|nt|fuquay:  In 6@C declarer may think a long time before deciding which @C to ruff the @D with ---- it makes no difference today|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|hT|nt|MrAce:  i don't think he would care much with double of 4@H, unless Levin joked|pg||

nt|kareno:  That's bad news for the Nickell team.|pg||
nt|fuquay:  Unfortunately, since he has options, it will probably take a while for him to decide which option to take|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pc|h8|pg||
nt|kareno:  I hear Meckwell are in slam in notrump|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d3|pc|d7|nt|phil:  North knows the hearts are on his left so underleading the @hK is a safe shot|pg||
nt|fuquay:  Yes, 6N in the other room|pg||
nt|MrAce:  6 NT can not make|pg||
nt|fuquay:  It looks like Hanlon does not want to trust Levin's double|pg||
nt|eamongall: Hanlon is well able to play bridge ...he beat me by 200 imps once |pg||
nt|phil:  sorry, my comment didnt notice the x of 4@h|pg||
nt|fuquay:  Since 3@H showed a singleton here, it was relatively safe for Levin to make a "fake double" of 4@H and so it is reasonable to be suspicious|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|fuquay:  As suggested by a spectator, declarer may now take two rounds of trumps leaving a high one in dummy|pg||
nt|fuquay:  If trumps split 3-2 then do a high ruff|pg||
nt|fuquay:  If trumps split 4-1 rely on the ruffing @H finesse|pg||

nt|MrAce:  true|pg||
nt|phil:  they can get it off the top but the tap looks more lucrative|pg||
nt|eamongall: Les did not really need to get involved on this hand |pg||
nt|fuquay:  The takeout ouble was very aggressive, but how many pairs do you know that would able to take advantage and double the 2@C?|pg||
nt|MrAce:  i thought steve had an auto negative double, you think he needs more than that to double?|pg||
nt|kareno:  Credit to Steve Weinstein for the action double|pg||
nt|eamongall: taking advantage is 500 or 800 ...doing nothing against 2@Cs is 200 or 300|pg||
nt|phil:  indeed - doubles in these low-level skirmishes need to be thoroughly discussed|pg||
nt|kareno:  In the first set, Meckwell were victims of that sort of double several times|pg||
nt|fuquay:  One posssibility here is to win, play a @S, get a ruff, play a @D, and then play another @S |pg||

nt|MrAce:  well if he ducks declarer will set hearts and he has entry to dummy. so he needs to win the A now |pg||
nt|phil:  theres no diamond guess anymore|pg||
nt|fuquay:  Best is to go up A and play a @D|pg||
nt|MrAce:  you mean small @D? |pg||
nt|eamongall: no doubt Steve knows that ...just checking if he can duck |pg||
nt|MrAce:  yes|pg||
nt|fuquay:  Might as well be small|pg||
nt|fuquay:  But even if E guesses right he only gets three more tricks|pg||
nt|phil:  diamonds is far better than giving a spade ruff. I think he just loses control|pg||
nt|MrAce:  he wont give @S ruff if he flies A|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|nt|kareno:  Running out of boards.|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|MrAce:  Kit is right, had Steve won the @D K and played a spade it was down |pg||
nt|eamongall: well I think he had 11 via @Hs and a X ruff |pg||
nt|phil:  I do not think thats true Timo|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4D|an|non serious?|nt|phil:  but I have wrong before|pg||
nt|phil:  doesnt he have 10 tricks (3S +5H + 2D) with the count rectified? |pg||
nt|MrAce:  he would be in hand with no @H, no @S KQTxx@C and Ax @D|pg||
nt|MrAce:  how was he suppose to make it? |pg||
nt|MrAce:  seriously|pg||
nt|MrAce:  because he won the 3rd @S with J and he went down once he played @DQ |pg||
nt|phil:  youre talking about - win @sQ / lose @dK ? |pg||
nt|MrAce:  i am talking about what Kit said|pg||
nt|phil:  anyway back to the action|pg||
nt|MrAce:  win the @DK and play @S |pg||
mb|p|nt|phil:  good hand for last train. |pg||
nt|fuquay:  Anyway, we are on board 28 and E seems to be thinking a long time here|pg||
nt|phil:  4@h simply says, I have have that club card you are worried about but cannot move toward slam myself|pg||
nt|ritong: he s supposed to bid 4@h showing the @c control pard denied, right?|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|ritong: oops|pg||

mb|1C!|an|14+ balanced|mb|p|mb|2H!|mb|p|mb|3D!|an|5+ spades; 4+ diamonds|nt|shuster:  even if he had divined to play a club ruff, then @SK, the @HAQ, he must guess whether to play for the diamond finesse or the @HJ to stand up.|pg||
nt|shuster:  Seems like there were a lot of different lines of play and almost all of them go down.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfk: after thinking, Meck just completed his description of 3@D:  5+ spades and 4+ diamonds|pg||
mb|3H!|an|3-2 in Rod's suits|mb|p|nt|shuster:  27 does rate to be a push.  If it is another game swing to Mittelman, that means 24 imps with 3 boards to go.  |pg||
