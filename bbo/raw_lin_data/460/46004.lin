nt|MrAce:  Some good players among kibs says it was obvious from the auction that Helgemo had 5@H+4@S, it could be helpful to play @C K and try to see if they will give count |pg||

nt|vugraphzfk: sA was played before second club|pg||
nt|lrobb98:  against 4 spades, the lead of the stiff beats it..simulations have shown that, even with 4 trumps and a tap suit, it is more often right to lead your stiff......there was a BW article on this |pg||
nt|MrAce:  I think the play continues but operator as he said, missed the @SA being played already |pg||
