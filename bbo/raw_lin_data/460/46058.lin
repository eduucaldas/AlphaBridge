nt|ady: suit a bit broken for 3@D   but difficult choice|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: the problem is  you have strength for jump rebid with 6 cards in your suit and only 3 in responder's suit|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|cK|nt|ahollan1: you want to show both, but standard bidding requires either overstating fit for partner or focusing on your suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: which is sometimes not as strong a suit as you like to have for jump rebid|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ahollan1: so Cole was developed in the Washington D.C. area in the 1980s   i don't think it ever really spread beyond mid-atlantic area|pg||
nt|runnerup:  if no gazilli or similar convention used ,,3@d will be bid in many tables with hand like this|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and Gazzilli hugely popluar because of Italian pairs success|pg||
nt|MrAce:  There was  similar topic in Bridge Base Forums and the suit by opener was worse than this.  Most top players like Justin Lall, Frances Hinden voted for jump rebid.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in scandinavia there is a version called Haxan|pg||

nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|ritong: this lead changes context|pg||
nt|MrAce:  Brad will not duck|pg||

nt|ady: would probably play ace and king of clubs in that case with still spade entry|pg||
nt|MrAce:  if he does this will lead Michael to drop the @CQ |pg||

nt|ritong: merci a tous  last segment soon|pg||
nt|ritong: estimation 10 minutes|pg||
nt|MrAce:  one thing about @S finesse, E would take play @H, Brad would win and play another @S, that would leave Michael to guess Qx @C offside to make, or onside|pg||

nt|RDS Reno: S shd NOT take the @C finesse.  Can afford to lose a @C to W, but not E.  Play for @C Q onside or Qx offside.|pg||
