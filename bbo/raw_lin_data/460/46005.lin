nt|Vugraphzfh: I'm sure it was all artficial relay, with some 3-2-1 points shown|pg||
nt|Psyck:  It is OK Al, we will just assume 2NT was a general game try & 3@c shows shortness or something|pg||

nt|ritong: he better clearly set @cs|pg||
nt|ritong: his plan bneing RKC next|pg||
nt|kareno: Curious why not 2@s.  He has already denied 3|pg||
nt|MrAce:  setting @C s will allow Multon to learn the cards he need when keycards.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan6: i wasn't watching play of  12 in 5@HX   not sure if score correct  or even possible|pg||
nt|ritong: he probably envisaged 4@c over 2@c|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|ritong: but that would prmise 5+ imo|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|nt|MrAce:  i think 2@D was a xfer bid, I am just guessing though |pg||
nt|ahollan6: ahhh  defense never established @C trick and @D set up|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|ahollan6: i think NS do play strong jump shifts   but people who know Soloway rules won't do that with 2nd suit unless it is Partner's suit|pg||
nt|ritong: apparently martens considers that his @d short is known|pg||
nt|ritong: my feeling is they both are playing with fire here|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|nt|Psyck:  Well the RKC appears to be for @c & not @s, which is good|pg||
nt|ahollan6: why didn't Martens show 3@S over 2@D??|pg||
nt|MrAce:  not knowing the system in this auction it is hard to tell where they are headed|pg||
nt|ahollan6: oh  2@C as gazzilli   makes sense|pg||
nt|reisig: Want a bet?   7@s|pg||
nt|ahollan6: then 2@D just says 8+points and 2@H = min with @H & @C   [other option for gaz 2@C is any strong han]|pg||
nt|MrAce:  I also suspect something like Gazilli or similar version of it |pg||
nt|MrAce:  because 2@H by Martens tells us 2@D was not regular 4th suit |pg||
mb|7S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|MrAce:  there you go, they found it. |pg||
nt|Psyck:  Rich has better table presence than those at the table|pg||
nt|ahollan6: 7@S + 100 honors beats 7N|pg||
nt|MrAce:  :)|pg||
nt|ahollan6: and i think makes 14 tricks so there is that too|pg||
nt|reisig: The play will be FAST|pg||
nt|ahollan6: oh  i was looking at 1 overtrick by ruffing @D  but can setup @H for 15th trick|pg||
pc|sT|mc|13|nt|MrAce:  coming up board maybe interesting too, EW managed to stay in game where slam would be cold on a finesse.|pg||
