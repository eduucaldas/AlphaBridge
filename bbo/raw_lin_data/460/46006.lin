nt|MrAce:  It makes it right for people who are playing the final. Who are we to tell them what is right? :) |pg||
mb|p|pc|h8|nt|ahollan6: i think 2N is same as 2@S-P-2N  but know that some play it as transfer  to show [depending upon agreement] a) @C  b) @C lead dired and fit  b) @C or @C lead direct with fit|pg||
nt|ahollan6: first time i read an issue of Bridge World it described the 2N bid that forced 3@C|pg||
nt|pdlit: an excellent point Timo; they are there and we are here|pg||

nt|ritong: reasonable to assume both @cK and @d A are onside|pg||
nt|ritong: but, also reasonable to assume @cs break poorly|pg||
nt|ahollan6: match is scheduled to end with  30   usually checking the Movie you can determine final board of the set|pg||

nt|ritong: i ruff A, @s to my hand and @d|pg||

nt|ahollan6: other room  2@D-P-2@H[pass/correct]-P//2@S-DBL  multon splintered with 4@H|pg||
nt|barnets: they can only go plus i think or get a push at worst|pg||
nt|ahollan6: does this force Martel to find profitable 5@H save?|pg||
nt|ritong: now, optimizing overtrick(s) is a bit too much for my lil brain|pg||
nt|medwards: Ruff and play club ten?|pg||
nt|chorush: The only contract I would be certain of the right line is 6 spades|pg||
