mb|p|nt|Dagold:  yes|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Dagold:  looks like Nab mmay have denied 3@s with 2N|pg||

nt|Dagold:  club queen lead could be interesting|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Dagold:  Queen then JACk|pg||
nt|Dagold:  NAB might go wrong|pg||
nt|vugrapho2: if only mr. Hackett's finger was to the left :)|pg||
nt|Dagold:  Paul catering to a singleton King which seems unlikely on the bidding|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c9|pc|c4|pg||

pc|c5|pc|c8|pc|c3|pg||

pc|h9|pc|c6|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d8|nt|Dagold:  he was hoping for 3@c, 1@h and a trick from partner|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d2|pg||
nt|Dagold:  a decent shot|pg||
nt|Dagold:  so Nabhas 4 spades (the 5-1 break means overtaking is only 4S tricks)|pg||
nt|Dagold:  1C|pg||
nt|Dagold:  2 diamonds and 1H|pg||
nt|Dagold:  he can safely make 2H tricks|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|s6|pg||

nt|Dagold:  NAB did not have to double with KJT of @h but he did well|pg||

mb|4N!|mb|p|nt|Dagold:  but I think after soe thought he will just settle for game|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@H instead of 3@H?|pg||

nt|dagold:  The reason that Price should double 6@d imo is two fold. Get a non-heart lead and take it two off if partnerhas a trick-say a club ruff|pg||
