nt|andreakis:  good point, Stefan|pg||
nt|Skorchev: althoug there is a lack of points and Vul vs not, some may people may not bid ... not our Croation friends tho :)|pg||

mb|1D|nt|marlowepi: an even better principle is:  Unless you are fairly confident that something else is better, go ahead and lead your partner's suit|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|andreakis:  1@D is unbalanced 5+ @D or (441)4 with 4@D|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2H|nt|andreakis:  leading partner's suit is also always good for partnership harmony|pg||
nt|marlowepi: game should be trivially beaten here|pg||
mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|andreakis:  I agree Marshall|pg||
nt|andreakis:  but still a nice win for Bulgarian team|pg||
mb|3C!|mb|3H|nt|marlowepi: yes and not only partership. there are responsibilities to the team. If leading partner's suit doesnt work out and some random aternative would have worked, there wil not be ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: repercussions for morae, and probablly not on the scoreboard either|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|andreakis:  I occasionally tend to lead what I think is good, but time has persuaded me differently|pg||
