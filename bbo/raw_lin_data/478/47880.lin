mb|2S|mb|4C|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: east has a lot of defence to spades so he won't want to sacrifice, but when he doesn't double, west might sacrifice |pg||
nt|athene: the underlying issue here is, how aggressively does east double?|pg||
nt|athene: if east doubles 4@S quite aggressively then surely west can now sacrifice|pg||

nt|athene: a common misunderstanding would be|pg||
nt|athene: north bids 4@H natural|pg||
nt|athene: but south thinks spades are agreed|pg||
nt|athene: and thinks "my 4@D denied a cub control, so if partner bids 4@H which is a control-bid for spades, he has to have a club control too"|pg||
nt|athene: and you get into all sorts of difficulties|pg||
nt|vugrapho2: but south can always rescue the situation by passing 4@H or am I wrong?|pg||
nt|athene: basically, it's good to know what trumps are before you set off on slam exploration|pg||
nt|athene: well south can't pass 4@H if he thinks it's a control bid agreeing spades|pg||
nt|vugrapho2: 3@H showed some sort of fit :)|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|athene: also here south should know 4@H was natural|pg||
nt|athene: because he has @HAK|pg||
nt|athene: so it can't be a control bid|pg||
nt|ahollan2: i think Marty Bergen taught    if you don't raise with 4-card support -- you don't have 4-card support|pg||
pc|c5|nt|athene: so yes, on this hand, south could/should perhaps have passed 4@H just to avoid a catastrophe|pg||

nt|athene: so even if double is not purely penalty it ought to be quite a defensive hand|pg||
nt|athene: but this hand is a good example of why top pairs are slow to double 2M - you have to budget for the occasional misdefence|pg||

mb|d|mb|p|nt|ahollan2: thru 7 boards   onstein has taken a 16+7 VP lead over  heimdal |pg||
nt|sommer:  don't we all ALWAYS want to bid an 80 % grandslam??|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|Authau: even 72%|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|sommer:  ...uff, that will go down in 28 %;)|pg||
nt|ahollan2: hideous hog helped me ignore % when he said    you have to bid the bad slams that make, because so many good ones go down|pg||
nt|vugrapho2: is this set full of doubleton Qs offside needed for contract? :)|pg||
nt|Authau: 3@h ?|pg||
nt|athene: hmmm, i was expecting the simple, honest 3@C over 2@D|pg||
nt|athene: just saying "I have a hand too good to overcall 2@C first time"|pg||
nt|ahollan2: sorry   1@H = 11-15, 5+@H, maybe equal or LONGER @S|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|sommer:  yes, I betted on the other table, that N would go down in 3NT..."noone" believed me ;)|pg||
nt|athene: if he cues then bids clubs that surely has to be game-forcing|pg||
nt|athene: so either he is never going to bid clubs or he thinks he has a game-force|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hK|nt|sommer:  what??|pg||
nt|Authau: lol|pg||
nt|vugrapho2: or he won't simply bid the game :)|pg||
nt|vugrapho2: bridge is an easy game :)|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h9|pc|h5|pg||
nt|Authau: and never bid his long suit|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|pc|hT|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|sommer:  maybe Multon banks on, Zim is not playing his best right now ??|pg||
nt|ahollan2: van prooijen did not open 3N   the table crashed so operator was playing catch-up|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sommer:  thats a way to score 6 imps for sure|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|pc|s4|pg||
nt|sommer:  ..or maybe only 5 with doublefinesse @D|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cT|pc|c4|pc|c2|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cQ|pc|c8|pc|c3|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|vugrapho2: Pierre started calling cards in French :)|pg||
nt|sommer:  NOW, he will not doublefinesse;)|pg||
nt|vugrapho2: up untill this board he was saying in English :)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|vugrapho2: maybe just under pressure because TD is near the table|pg||
nt|ahollan2: as long as multon is not screaming in french - we're ok|pg||
nt|vugrapho2: guys running late|pg||
nt|athene: :) garozzo-belladonna had an agreement, that when dummy went down, if it was good contract, declarer said "thankyou", but if dummy had got the system wrong and it was a disaster, ...|pg||
nt|athene: he would say "grazie"|pg||
nt|sommer:  yes:)|pg||
nt|athene: one time garozzo put down dummy after a long precision club auction and belladonna absentmindedly said "grazie" |pg||
pc|hJ|pc|c5|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ahollan2: i had never heard that bill - thanks!|pg||
pc|s6|nt|athene: and garozzo jumped to his feet and cried "grazie!? what do you mean, grazie?"|pg||

pc|sK|pc|d3|pc|s7|pc|s5|pg||
nt|ahollan2: i should have waited for the punchline :)|pg||
nt|vugrapho2: you jinxed him|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d2|pc|dT|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|sommer:  besides, I bet it was "Blue club" not precision|pg||
nt|vugrapho2: Multon started complaining in French :)|pg||
pc|h2|pc|c6|mc|10|nt|athene: i think it was Precision because B-G only played as a pair late on in the Blue Team career|pg||
nt|ahollan2: belladonna-garozzo played superprecision |pg||
nt|vugrapho2: final board|pg||
nt|sommer:  My Danish friend Dennis Bilde bid and made 7@h with Duboin;)|pg||
