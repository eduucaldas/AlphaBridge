mb|1D|mb|1H|mb|d|mb|2H|nt|MrSigma: let's see if NS can reach 3@D|pg||
nt|eieio:  NS can make some number of diamonds|pg||
nt|eieio:  However, North's diamond holding is weak for 3@D|pg||
mb|d|nt|eieio:  Support double?|pg||
nt|MrSigma: supposed to be although he already knows they at most have 7 cards fit in @S|pg||
nt|eieio:  Some players play 1@D-1@H-Dbl = 4 or 5 spades|pg||
mb|3H|nt|MrSigma: maybe he just wanted to encourage his partner to play 4-3 fit 2@S|pg||
nt|eieio:  North's hand is ideal|pg||
nt|eieio:  It's OK to play 2@s if the opponents have a 9-card fit|pg||
nt|eieio:  the law of total tricks will support that|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|MrSigma: 4D still makes|pg||
nt|eieio:  South just tries to visualize his partner's hand|pg||
nt|MrSigma: they reached their par|pg||
nt|eieio:  3 spades, probably singleton or void @h given the opponents' bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|eieio:  therefore 5 or 6 diamonds|pg||
pc|hA|nt|eieio:  par should be 5@D=|pg||

mb|p|nt|eieio:  EW were in 1NT-1 in CR|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|eieio:  EW hands have communication issue, 1NT is very tough contract|pg||
nt|eieio:  I'll say 1NT-1 in CR is a good result for NCCU|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|eieio:  West must be hoping that partner has 3@h|pg||

pc|c5|pg||
nt|MrSigma: I think it is very hard for both the declarer and the defender to picture how the cards lie|pg||
pc|c6|nt|eieio:  declarer can take 2@H via a finesse 2@D, @CKQ the crossruff|pg||
pc|c2|nt|eieio:  East can't get in the draw trump after this trick|pg||
pc|sK|pc|cT|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|sA|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s3|pc|h2|pc|s5|pg||
pc|h3|nt|MrSigma: making 3 after E cashed the Q of @S|pg||
pc|h7|nt|eieio:  Declarer should be able to take 9 tricks via mark finesse in spades|pg||
nt|eieio:  will be fun if W refuses to cover here|pg||
nt|MrSigma: but if W ducks now, the declarer has slight chances to get the wrong way|pg||
nt|eieio:  To take 9 tricks, declarer has to overtake to cash @DAK|pg||
nt|eieio:  Yes, and that could be 2 tricks difference|pg||

nt|MrSigma: maybe S will lead the @D?|pg||
nt|vanilla3M:  I think he shd now since North open 1@D (which could be 2 though)|pg||
mb|p|nt|wkc:  NS play precision, so more likely S will lead a @C|pg||
nt|MrSigma: NS is playing Precsion, so 1@D only promises 2 cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|MrSigma: amazing pass to me|pg||
pc|d6|nt|MrSigma: as I predicted, he led the @D|pg||
nt|vanilla3M:  I think operator misclaimed or misplayed at other table|pg||
nt|wkc:  ok, he got me|pg||
nt|MrSigma: maybe W often inv with only 6-7?|pg||
nt|vanilla3M:  the movie showed 3NT= but claimed -2|pg||

pc|s2|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|MrSigma: I don't see any reason put the J of @D|pg||
nt|wkc:  if declarer notice that, he could play low from board|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|pc|s4|pc|s3|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|vanilla3M:  Since there is no entry back to hand. finesse K of @h would be better|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d8|pc|c5|pg||
nt|wkc:  and on the second round of @D, maybe S will play 4, then declarer could try to rise the K|pg||
