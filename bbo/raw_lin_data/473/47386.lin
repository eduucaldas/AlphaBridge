mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h6|nt|gracelin: 1NT is 14+ to 17, 3C asks for 5-card majors|pg||
nt|gracelin: The match will be 80 boards play in 5 segments|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hK|nt|gracelin: 3 sets today and 2 sets tomorrow|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer has 8 tricks now but on a heart return the diamond has a block situation.|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hQ|pc|h5|nt|gracelin: declarer may need to use CK as entry for the 5th heart as well as the 9th trick|pg||

pc|s2|nt|gracelin: he hopes diamonds are 2-2, with 3-1 the 4th round would have to be won in dummy.|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s9|nt|gracelin: declarer is now making this with 3S/2H/4D. |pg||
nt|gracelin: north can beat this by shifting to CJ on 2nd trick.|pg||
nt|gracelin: but it's not obvious|pg||
nt|gracelin: don't think it's south thinking. Probably it's the operator cannot follow the play.|pg||
nt|gracelin: Guess declarer will take 9 tricks in the end|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
mc|9|nt|gracelin: Indeed declarer took 9 tricks even he cannot score the 5th diamond|pg||
nt|gracelin: South's H6 leadwas not 4th best, so north might consider to shift to CJ at 2nd trick |pg||

nt|gracelin: declarer might take 5 top tricks plus two ruffs for 7 tricks|pg||
