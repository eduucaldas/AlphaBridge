nt|lmilne:  I haven't commented on Gold's opening bid - first seat anything goes but I'm not sure what the idea is after one opponent has passed. Obviously preeempting can win though|pg||

nt|lmilne:  Lazer is more likely to cooperate with any tries now that his hand his been limited|pg||
nt|ritong: which is why ranging your hand should be a major preoccupation in any situaton|pg||
nt|ritong: +i*|pg||
nt|lmilne:  if the @DAce is led, the play will be simple, but even a defensive heart ruff should not trouble a declarer in slam|pg||
nt|lmilne:  I'm impressed that she can be 100% sure that 1@H will not be passed. perhaps spades first would have simplified the auction, allowing a 3@H bid now|pg||

nt|lmilne:  I would pass here in Lazer's position. with so much in partner's shortage and so little outside. he does have club support however... he could be 3352|pg||
