nt|paulg:  Many of us will be watching the England v Ireland rugby match being held just down the road, later this afternoon|pg||
nt|paulg:  Hopefully less fighting at the RAC Club in London.|pg||
nt|paulg:  The Allfrey team representing England, the Moran team representing Ireland.|pg||
nt|paulg:  Information on the event, including an explanation of the scoring, at https://lederertrophy.wordpress.com/|pg||
nt|paulg:  There are 48 VP to be split between the teams: 30 VP based on the IMP score, 18 VP on BAM/point-a-board|pg||
nt|paulg:  9-board matches|pg||
nt|aardv:  hello Paul.  it says 10-board matches on the website - is that wrong?|pg||
nt|paulg:  Looking at the results it does look like 10-board matches|pg||
nt|paulg:  there are also two different explanations of the scoring, one for 9-board and one for 10-board matches ;)|pg||
nt|paulg:  The scoring for this event is explained here - https://lederertrophy.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/2016-lederer-scoring1.pdf|pg||
nt|paulg:  so 10-board matches, 50 VP split between the teams, 30VP on the IMP score, 20VP on BAM/point-a-board|pg||
mb|1C|an| |mb|p|mb|1S|an| |nt|paulg:  Moran normally plays with Rory Boland, I wonder Ireland are just five players this weekend|pg||
nt|aardv:  1@C is North's normal opening with a weak NT|pg||
mb|d|nt|paulg:  Allfrey-Robson play a short 1@c opener with transfer responses|pg||
mb|1N|nt|aardv:  1@S is like a 1NT response|pg||
mb|2H|mb|3C|nt|paulg:  Slightly dangerous for Robson to compete when his partner may have two clubs and five diamonds|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cK|nt|aardv:  2@H was an imaginative effort|pg||
nt|paulg:  I suspect Hanlon expected Moran to have a takeout double of 1@c rather than just spades?|pg||
nt|aardv:  with the point-a-board element, the players will be very aggressive on part -score deals at love all|pg||

pc|cJ|nt|aardv:  three off was available to the defence if North had risen with the ace of diamonds and played three rounds of trumps ending in South, so he could cash club tricks.  I'd be amazed if anyone found that defence.|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|aardv:  1@H transfer to spades|pg||
mb|p|pc|s6|nt|aardv:  1@S will often be passed out, so East came in with values but no shape|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sJ|pc|s5|pg||
nt|paulg:  East cannot have a pure penalty of 1@s when he did not overcall, so he'll normally be balanced with less than a 1NT overcall|pg||
