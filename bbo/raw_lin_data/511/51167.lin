mb|1H|nt|herbie22:  of course North may get involved in diamonds....|pg||
nt|herbie22:  or perhaps some other way (double of a raise)|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D!|an|short !d's 4+ !h's; limited splinter|nt|herbie22:  Maybe North will double and double?|pg||

nt|herbie22:  First of all, what would double of 4D mean...for some...lead clubs|pg||
