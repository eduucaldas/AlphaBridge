nt|ahollan1: meck won't sit|pg||

nt|ahollan1: telepathically ask partner how many @H he has??|pg||
nt|kit: hi everybody|pg||
nt|warrens:  hi Kit|pg||
nt|warrens:  if you assume the 4@h bidder has a singleton, then there are no good slams|pg||
nt|warrens:  there would be either a ruff, a natural trump trick, or a tap|pg||
nt|kit: I can't see making a move on the North hand -- partner could have basically nothing,|pg||
nt|shuster:  If you knew the opponents had an 8-card spade fit, saving is clear|pg||
mb|p|mb|5H|nt|shuster:  but the opponents might be in a 4-3 fit on this auction|pg||
nt|kit: Ah -- was East who was thinking|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|shuster:  I suspect that is what East was considering|pg||
mb|5S|nt|kit: Now -- are N-S in a force?  Probably|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: gordon v coren  berkowitz passed 4@S   bates saved 5@HX gained another 8   coren leads by 98|pg||
nt|warrens:  South's pass is forcing since the preempt was facing a passed hand|pg||
nt|kit: Pretty good decisions by all it looks like|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|warrens:  agreed|pg||
nt|shuster:  East was a passed hand and West a (possibly heavy) preempt, so N/S should probably consider this a force|pg||
nt|shuster:  when a preemtor leads his own suit, their singleton is usually in trumps|pg||
nt|shuster:  declarer is aware of this and will assume 4-1 spades|pg||
nt|kit: Probably right to ruff, play one high trump from dummy, and then knock out ace of clubs|pg||
pc|s7|pc|h3|pc|h7|pg||
nt|warrens:  isn't it safe to play two rounds of Trump, then play on @c's?|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|s5|pg||
pc|cK|nt|warrens:  I take it back, this is better|pg||
nt|kit: I suppose it is okay|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c5|nt|kit: I just saw that this approach has to make and stopped thinking.|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|kit: actually no, 2 rounds of trumps isn't safe.  Trumps 4-1, East wins, plays third trump, and if East has doubleton club you lose a heart|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s4|pc|s6|pc|h5|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|kit: odd that he now plays the second trump -- seems like danger could still exist.|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 2@D = BAL, 8-10|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S natural and ASK|pg||
nt|shuster:  perhaps East should show 4333 with this honor structure.  Knowing when to lie about your shape in response to a relay is an inexact science at best|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N = 4@S  and i think 4(432)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ah  explanations from operator confirm|pg||
nt|kit: Play in 6@S might be interesting.  Natural to attack hearts with heart to queen.  But South wins, returns club, and now have to guess between club finesse and heart pickup.|pg||
