nt|kit: Likely 4NT by West now, showing secondary club suit.|pg||

nt|ahollan1: in other room DelMonte east DBL of 4@H  then Willenken 4N    now playing 5@DX|pg||
nt|kit: Tough problem for West.  Queen of diamond could be falsecard from Qxx, in which case may be necessary to continue diamonds to beat contact.|pg||
nt|kit: But if queen of diamonds is singleton, then diamond continuation fatal (they play standard signals here).|pg||
nt|kit: I think from his point of view best chance is to continue diamonds -- difficult to see 3 tricks on the side if declarer has stiff diamond.|pg||
nt|kit: And setting up jack of diamonds doesn't necessarily cost a trick anyway -- depends on which way declarer is 4-3 in blacks, and exact spade position.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Kit  in your partnerships   what does 3rd hand play to trick 1|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d3|nt|kit: worth noting that both South's chose 3NT instead of 9-card heart fit, due to strong minors.|pg||
nt|kit: so often 9 tricks are easier than 10.|pg||
nt|shuster:  declarer doesn't know the cards are so friendly.  He'd like to lose the first round of hearts to the king to keep entries fluid|pg||
nt|shuster:  if, for example, he wins and leads a low heart toward the jack, it loses, and a second diamond comes back, the hands could be severed on 3-1 hearts.|pg||
nt|kit: Note that even if they had led clubs, declarer would definitely have 5 hearts, 2 diamonds, and 2 clubs|pg||
nt|shuster:  one attractive line is to lead the @HQ from dummy at trick two.  A club from dummy is also possible.|pg||
nt|kit: Can't declarer just lead a club at trick 2 and claim?|pg||
nt|shuster:  yes, by leading a club at trick two, he can then make so long as hearts aren't 4-0 offside|pg||
nt|shuster:  and sometimes even then|pg||
nt|aardv:  can he?  they win and play a diamond back.|pg||
nt|shuster:  yes, not cold|pg||
nt|shuster:  the natural play for me would be the @HQ from dummy.  If @S AQT is offside and LHO has both the @CA and the @HK, I go down that way.|pg||
nt|kit: I win, cash another diamond, 1 club, and play jack of hearts.  What can they do?|pg||
nt|shuster:  win the @HK, cross to the @SA and run two diamonds?|pg||
nt|kit: Or maybe don't cash the diamond.  It is pretty secure.|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d4|pc|d6|pg||

nt|kit: a spade.  I don't take 2nd diamond.  Yes, in a very bad variation I could go down.|pg||
