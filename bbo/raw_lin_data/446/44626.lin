nt|kit: And if he does, then what?|pg||
nt|warrens:  possibly a X here asking his partner to compete|pg||
nt|kit: But wouldn't a double imply 4 hearts?|pg||
nt|warrens:  he doesn't know if his partner is 4-5 or 5-4, so it's a tough position|pg||
nt|kit: Agree -- the main problem for this defense vs. 1NT|pg||
mb|d|an|desire to compete|mb|r|an|spade fit|nt|warrens:  know West can show 3@s|pg||
nt|warrens:  I think XX shows 3 trumps and a max|pg||
nt|warrens:  Platinick can now bid 3@c or 2NT.  I think 2NT should show 4-5 and 3@c 4-6.  with 5@h's, he would just bid @h's.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Hurd points out we have played 3 bds in 45 minutes|pg||
nt|kit: That makes sense.  At any rate, now that spade fit is shown East will compete to 3@S, which is comfortable.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|warrens:  Wooldridge might think his partner has a doubleton @h on this auction and could bid again|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfc: as you see, Wooldridge bid 4@S|pg||
nt|kit: and the fatal but logical heart lead, so East's aggressiveness will pay off.|pg||

nt|odysseus69: small club works well|pg||
