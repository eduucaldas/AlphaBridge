nt|ronsmithsf:  big or 3@D?|pg||
nt|kit: East can consider passing, but risky.|pg||
nt|ronsmithsf:  3N?|pg||
nt|reisig: Risk/reward situation|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|ronsmithsf:  what do you know|pg||
nt|kit: He isn't too likely to defeat 2@S 2 tricks, and may have a partial anyway, so passing not right|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: Well, this is a surprise -- after partner wouldn't invite over 1NT|pg||
nt|kit: But it could be the winner.|pg||
nt|ronsmithsf:  usually people play the reopening 6-8 pts|pg||
nt|ronsmithsf:  That's why I called it|pg||
nt|kit: South's best lead, oddly enough, is declarer's suit -- diamonds.|pg||
nt|ronsmithsf:  he will probably stay away from @s|pg||
nt|kit: yes, he has to know declarer is ready for spade lead considering his holding.|pg||
nt|runnerup:  almost all leads will give 9. trick ..so balancing was risky business|pg||
pc|h6|nt|kit: You don't expect to be balancing the opponents into 3NT when they stop in 1NT.|pg||
nt|kit: This probably gives declarer his ninth trick.|pg||
nt|reisig: A reasonable shot ..@h |pg||
nt|kit: AJxx or AJ10x probably the most dangerous of all holdings to lead from, and so it proves here.|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h8|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|ronsmithsf:  I agree! leading from A 4th into a no-trump opener not usually good|pg||
nt|rduran1216:  hard to blame steve though, trying to find partner's side card|pg||
nt|kit: but if that is partner's side card, he doesn't need to lead it.|pg||
nt|runnerup:  sure ,,still borderlne decision ..you have only 3 red cards ,,and almost certain that they have more strengt than you side  |pg||
nt|ronsmithsf:  a case for leading conservative since you know they have less than 26 HCP and partner is now known to b light|pg||
nt|rduran1216:  that's probably true|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|d8|pc|s3|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer may still have to guess the spades for his ninth trick, as if he misguesses defense gets 2 spades, 1 diamond, 2 hearts|pg||
nt|rduran1216:  J of hearts now I'd think|pg||
nt|kit: Yes, that seems clear.|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|pc|h5|pc|h4|pg||

pc|h3|pc|s7|pc|h2|pc|hT|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h9|pc|c5|pc|s5|pg||
nt|kit: South will cash heart, exit with diamond, and will come down to spade guess.|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ronsmithsf:  Steve not playing Richie for 2 Queens|pg||
nt|kit: after this, declarer can with jack of clubs, cash diamonds, and what do defenders keep?|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|cJ|pg||
