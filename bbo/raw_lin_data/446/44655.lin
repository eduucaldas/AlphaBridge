mb|p|mb|1D|an|2+|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|vugraphzfb: Will East splinter? Or go through 2@C (GF)?|pg||
nt|rduran1216:  West is going to love a 4D bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: By the way, most Precision pairs have modified the GF/INV bids over 1@D-1@H-1@S|pg||
mb|4D|nt|vugraphzfb: Instead of a more normal XYZ base, they use 2@C as a GF and 2@D for the invites|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzfb: because over a GF, opener needs to be able to bid 2@D to show 5+ in the nebulous context|pg||
mb|p|pc|c3|nt|vugraphzfb: So 2@D becomes an invite in one of the majors, although some modify this further|pg||
nt|3for3:  Good morning, from Las Vegas|pg||
nt|medwards: Hi|pg||
nt|rduran1216:  this lead will put pressure on in Brian's mind, but as we see everything is friendly here|pg||

pc|c4|pc|cT|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|medwards: Interesting lead|pg||
nt|3for3:  The 'unbid' suit. |pg||
nt|rduran1216:  I think in this auction it's pretty normal|pg||
nt|3for3:  Although 1@D could easily be a doubleton here, even 4225, for example|pg||
nt|rduran1216:  you know RHO lives in diamonds so you need to be active, and it would take monster hearts in partner's hand for a heart to be better|pg||

nt|odysseus69: going back to my favourite question- does everyone open on West|pg||
nt|smsj: I do|pg||

nt|ritong: reliable*|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|pc|c4|pc|s5|pg||
nt|smsj: Ah. Well its' a fairly narrow range of hands that can make 5@C and not 3NT, probably more fall in the reverse.|pg||
nt|ritong: 2@s showing four @hs  3@d showing 0454|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d4|pc|d2|nt|odysseus69: are defence allowed to lead trumps against 5 clubs|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|ritong: courtesy of mike passell|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Sorry - I have put the meanings of 3@d and 3NT into the bidding diagram twice and for some reason they go away - 3@d showed 04(54) and 3NT showed specifically 54 in diamonds|pg||

nt|vugraphzfb: If JD game-forces, we should be able to see how they unwind all the shapes after FSF|pg||
mb|2H|nt|rduran1216:  I wonder if S bid 2S in other room|pg||
nt|3for3:  I know Platnick has spent a lot of time on this exact auction|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S!|mb|p|nt|vugraphzfb: OK, so he uses 2@S to show hearts|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|3for3:  if Diamond finds out he is 0454, will he choose 3nt, or 5@C?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: I've played 2@S = three spades OR exactly 8 minor-suit cards|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Hence 1=4 in the majors|pg||
nt|rduran1216:  game's look down like the titanic|pg||
mb|3S!|mb|p|nt|3for3:  Or, even 4@H|pg||
nt|rduran1216:  no offense to our viewers who are boat accident survivors|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sA|nt|3for3:  Defense does have to be a little careful here.  |pg||
nt|3for3:  Presumably Diamond has not shown a 5th spade, but if Fireman continues spades, 3NT can make|pg||
pc|d4|pc|s5|pc|s7|pg||
nt|rduran1216:  Kranyak, who is very good at bridge, won the spade lead and played a diamond to the 9!|pg||

nt|vugraphzfb: Did that work out for him? Defense still OK from that start|pg||
