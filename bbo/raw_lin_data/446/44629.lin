nt|rduran1216:  you have a bid for that shape...1S|pg||

nt|kevsters: probably declarer should have continued playing spades once he started, now if bathurst plays a heart things get very annoying|pg||
pc|h3|nt|kevsters: still some endplay possibilties to save a trick or two, but definitely down here|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hJ|pc|hT|pg||
pc|d5|nt|vugraphzfb: Declarer went down in slam on 10, so 13 to Diamond instead of 12 to Fireman|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: He misguessed the hearts|pg||
nt|kevsters: yep greco had to shift to a trump and correctly did so, putting wooldridge to the guess|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|ahollan4: 1@S = 10-15|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfc: 4@S is wide ranging opposite the limited opener|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ahollan4: 4@S = wide range   can be pure preempt, 3-fit with minimum opening bid  and others|pg||
nt|ahollan4: that don't have slam interest|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s7|nt|ahollan4: drat  Joe got there first|pg||
pc|s9|pg||

nt|vugraphzfb: OK, last board of the segment. Back at 6:10 mountain time (8:10 NY time) for the last set of the day|pg||
nt|rduran1216:  certainly 7|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|kevsters: jlall possibly counting the JS, then adds up to 8|pg||
nt|rduran1216:  you mean 5:10 california time?|pg||
mb|2N|an|GF spade raise|mb|4H|nt|kevsters: yes|pg||
nt|kevsters: favorable 4h bid|pg||
nt|kevsters: a lot of pairs dont have agreement about competition over jacoby 2nt, which makes competing especially attractive|pg||

nt|kevsters: very strong play by fireman to play low from dummy at trick 1|pg||
nt|medwards: Bols tip|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|kevsters: should probably attack clubs now|pg||
pc|hA|pc|s9|pc|h4|pg||
pc|c6|nt|kevsters: unfortunately seems like he will run out of entries to his hand playing this way|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cQ|pc|c4|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: This is actually a cost from playing against a pair without agreements. If JLall knew 4@S implied heart shortness (or offense), he could duck|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: as KB wouldn't have a stiff|pg||
nt|kevsters: true, but that's a little like saying we shouldnt play stayman because the opponents may gain info from it|pg||
nt|kevsters: of course maybe we shouldnt :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: But that's a counterpoint to preempting high here|pg||

nt|vugraphzfb: OK, that's it for this set|pg||
