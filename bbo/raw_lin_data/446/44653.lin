mb|3N|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: Ether E (at the colors, especially if EW were playing a strong club) or S hands might open the bidding in some quarters|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|d5|nt|kit: Very enterprising 3@D call by West, which put opponents under a lot of pressure|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dQ|pc|d3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: This is probably first among the innumerable reasons why a conservative opening-bid style is dangerous rather than safe.  Those who hold a "French Passed Hand"  very often have to ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: decide later on whether to keep sitting on their values or alternatively to overbid in an attemoot to catch up|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d9|pc|dJ|pc|c2|pg||
nt|kit: It is true that N-S could have collected 300 vs. 3@D, but difficult to do.  And if they did, no big loss.  But look at the upside -- N-S have a disaster, as happened.  Worth ...|pg||
nt|kit: thinking about.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Yes the 3D call has the added advantage  -- and this may have been foremost in Ishmael's mind when he did it  --  that it prevents the opening bidder from using a support double ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: (as opposed to a mere 2D raise or even a cue)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: welcome kit :) should have said that long ago :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Bates may have bid 3N just to embarrass me because I dismissed this hand as a desultory partscore deal :)|pg||
nt|kit: Bates did have a real problem, particularly if he couldn't make a penalty double of 3@D (which is the way many play).|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c3|nt|marlowepi: I think double is the most attractive choice no matter what it means. Partner can;t take the penalty interpretation all that seriously since opps have gone to the 3 level ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: voluntarily and are NV|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and we do have two aces and a king facing a fourth-seat-unfavorable opening|pg||

nt|ahollan1: a) moss did not alert|pg||
pc|c4|mc|9|nt|ahollan1: b) granovetter knowing NS 2 systems and they have context sensitive defense  did not ask which 1@C was used|pg||

mb|3H|mb|d|nt|kit: East finding all this hard to believe|pg||
mb|p|nt|warrens:  hi Kit, hi all.|pg||
nt|kit: Is this double penalty?  Most don't play it that way.|pg||
nt|warrens:  I think he can't risk passing|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|kit: Clearly not -- I guess is is just going to follow with 4@S|pg||
nt|kit: Or more now.|pg||
nt|kit: West's initial takeout double marginal|pg||
nt|warrens:  I expect 4@h next|pg||
mb|4H|nt|warrens:  :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: remember East will be convinced that West has a heart void, so slam looks very possible to him.|pg||
nt|warrens:  now, as long as Ish thinks this shows a fit, he'll bid 4@s|pg||
nt|kit: Bad idea to bid slam when they stop in partial at other table (which they did)|pg||
mb|5D|nt|marlowepi: 2H not exactly classic but within many people's parameters. X by W minimum but normal. Not a big fan of 3H by N, which  from a competitive perspective is likely to be a waste of ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: "breath" so  with this strength it is probably best for it to include desire for a heart lead,, or else to be a suggestion of saving at 4H over an opposing 3N.|pg||
mb|p|mb|5S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h6|nt|marlowepi: Against some folks, 3H by N might have the advantage of taking the 3-level cuebid away, but that is solved rather easily by a X (as here)|pg||
nt|kit: This is ugly, but with everything behaving it looks like he will have his 11 tricks.|pg||
nt|warrens:  now he's got some work to do, but the cards are favorable.  based on the bidding, he's pretty safe ruffing the second @h low|pg||

mb|2N|mb|p|nt|kit: East has difficult rebid|pg||
nt|kit: 3@C doesn't seem sufficient, 2NT is misdirected, etc.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe NV, but the suit quality is mediocre for that, and the 1D bid behind him  --  plus the dull shape  --  lend it perhaps too high a risk/reward ratio|pg||
nt|warrens:  2NT seems practical|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: I think I would have just forced to game with 2@H so as to improve the chances of finding the right strain.|pg||
mb|p|pc|s4|nt|marlowepi: perhaps a slight overbid, but I would bid 2H 4SGF if available|pg||
nt|marlowepi: especially at IMPs, generally worth overbidding if that will allow a full exploration fo strain|pg||
pc|h4|pc|s8|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|kit: At other table East opened 2@C (their canape), South naturally overcalled 2@S, and went for 500.|pg||
