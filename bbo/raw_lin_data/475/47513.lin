nt|athene: north didn't double 2@S so south looks elsewhere|pg||
pc|c4|pc|s5|pc|cJ|pc|c6|pg||
nt|athene: interesting falsecard from North at trick 1 - he knows the position is going to be revealed so his partner will know what is going on|pg||
nt|athene: but declarer might well now think south has the @CQ|pg||
nt|athene: so another club now and he might finesse the @C9|pg||
nt|sunsamvar:  hi. back now|pg||
nt|athene: you might argue that south would never lead a club here with the queen and give declarer a free finesse, but he might if he started with @CQJxxx, and he hopes to make his long ...|pg||
nt|athene: club?|pg||
nt|sunsamvar:  Yes Roland... very generous prizy money... courtsey HCL|pg||
nt|athene: also there is a lot of psychology - if declarer will refuse the finesse, then you CAN do it with the queen|pg||
nt|athene: if you can see that is the only chance to beat the contract, and a second club trick is irrelevant anyway because declarer will have enough tricks in time using the diamonds|pg||
nt|sunsamvar:  HCL is one of the biggest software companies in India |pg||
nt|sunsamvar:  The Chairmans is Shiv Nadar and he was the title sponsor for the 42nd World Championship in Chennai a year ago.|pg||
nt|athene: some people are suggesting south might switch to a small heart|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: playing standard methods of course north can't have the @HQ if he has @CKQ, as he passed 1@S|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h9|nt|athene: but with strong club maybe he could|pg||

pc|d3|nt|sunsamvar:  N had a good case to correct to 4@H here. what say U Will ?|pg||
nt|athene: i think it was a relay auction|pg||
