nt|gracelin: Lian won yesterday's R32 by 3 imps.  Will their lucks continue today ?|pg||
nt|gracelin: Looks like a diamond partial for NS|pg||
nt|kareno:  But e/w can compete in hearts of east overcalls - but not appealing, vulnerable|pg||
nt|gracelin: Looks like in 3D declarer only lose one trick in every suit.  But he lacks the entries for a double finesse in trump.|pg||
nt|kareno:  Maybe they are taking a break?|pg||
mb|1D!|mb|1H|nt|gracelin: NS are playing Precision now.  1D doesn't promise length|pg||
mb|d|mb|2D!|nt|kareno:  Well, too much competition will put e/w quite minus.|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|gracelin: withg two extremly balanced hand, Guess they woin't bid beyond 2H|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: East has an easy SJ lead, and know not to duck HA.|pg||
nt|gracelin: so the defense may prevail to get -1 as in the other room.|pg||

pc|s6|pc|s4|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s3|pc|s7|pc|d3|pg||
nt|gracelin: The winning line is to ruff the 3rd spade, play a club to CK and run D9.|pg||
nt|gracelin: But that's a bit double dummy.  CQ could be on|pg||
nt|kareno:  But the overcall will deter him|pg||
nt|gracelin: He could count West to hold 10 HCP for his 2D cue with a 4333 pattern.  So the HCP division is East 8, West 10|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|pc|d4|pc|d2|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dQ|pc|d9|pc|dT|pg||
nt|kareno:  Well, he is accepting defeat - the club loses.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|gracelin: East maybe squeezed between heart and club(if he pitches a club, declarer can play CK, CJ) in the end.|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hQ|pc|c8|pg||
nt|gracelin: but wonder declarer will play that way.|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h9|pc|d5|pc|hT|pg||
nt|gracelin: now a trump to West will see the squeeze work|pg||
nt|kareno:  If he plays the jack of clubs off dummy now, that is a play called by the French 'le buffalo,' and I made it once in Paris at the club to everyone's delight, even the victims :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: If declarer guesses the layout, he could also go to CK to ruff a spade, then endplay West with a trump|pg||
nt|gracelin: Essentially, he has to guess who has CQ|pg||
nt|kareno:  That works too - |pg||
nt|gracelin: He has no chance to make the le buffalo now :(|pg||
nt|kareno:  So I'm told in Denmark that is called a Chinese finesse|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c5|pc|cK|pc|c2|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s8|pc|d8|nt|kareno:  Here in the States it is called a backward finesse or reverse finesse|pg||
