pc|h4|pc|h8|nt|paulg:  yes, amusing that some might open the East hand with a weak 2@d but his partner has a Flannery opener too|pg||

nt|paulg:  3@c was inventitive, but has value if East becomes declarer in hearts as you might expect|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Platnick put screen down to ask something, not sure, but I think it was what DBL of 3@c by either partner would be|pg||
nt|paulg:  it might look clear to lead a spade to knock out the entry to the hearts ... but Lee might expect North to have six clubs and expect that there is a trump entry anyhow|pg||
nt|paulg:  he might decide that a small diamond is more likely to get closer to five tricks, because it seems to need a lot|pg||

nt|runnerup:  north was not worth of 3 @c maybe |pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: Platnick has summoned the director because Hamman did not alert the 2@d bid and Platnick says he might not have bid had he known it was Flannery -- he assumed it was a weak 2@d bid|pg||
