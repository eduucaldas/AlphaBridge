nt|warrens:  I don't see any way to beat this the way he played it.|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|warrens:  what does South play after winning, something neutral?|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|warrens:  I think only a @h return beats it.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|kit: Could be a critical lead here|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c4|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|kit: Now real tough problem.  What does partner's 4 of clubs mean here?|pg||
nt|warrens:  I assume it's suit preference and he played a middle, neutral, club|pg||
nt|kit: If he can read the club position, small diamond looks best.|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dJ|nt|kit: Keeps control of things.|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d6|pg||
nt|warrens:  has to play another @d now|pg||
nt|kit: Apparently he couldn't read the club position.  But I don't see how this can be better than a small diamond, unless he fears declarer has a stiff diamond.|pg||
nt|kit: I'm sure all those middle spots which East is playing are supposed to mean something, but I don't know what.|pg||
nt|ritong: denying a @s feature, maybe|pg||
nt|kit: But he has a spade feature|pg||
nt|ritong: which, with this dummy, looks key|pg||
nt|warrens:  I agree, Kit, I like a small @d, but he doesn't know the @c count|pg||
nt|kit: That's the question -- does he know the club count|pg||
nt|kit: If he lays down the ace of spades, East better play the queen to deny the king.|pg||
nt|kit: Then West will know to play a diamond, and at least get down 1 out of it.|pg||

mb|2C|an|Natural|nt|ahollan1: 2@C = 10-15, 6+@C|pg||
nt|chorush: if Berkowitz didnt overruf the spade and play a diamond he made 5, so I assume he did|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: seating rights   high seed gets to make first choice or pass|pg||
nt|ahollan1: then picks are 1,2,2,1|pg||
nt|swanson:  I wonder if this is too good for a non-vul opening in the N-S partnership.|pg||
mb|3H|an|Natural, forcing|mb|3S|nt|chorush: one team selects a segment 1-6 that it has rights, then other team selects two segements, then first team 2 segments, the the other team the one that is left|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@C-2@H = F1   not sure what inferences added with jump to 3M being FG|pg||
nt|ahollan1: perhaps -- THIS IS TRUMP|pg||
nt|swanson:  I thought North might even double 3@S, suggesting the misfit.|pg||
nt|chorush: it takes a spade lead and continuation, either now or after winning the ace of clubs to beat this|pg||
pc|sA|nt|pdlit: opening lead small @d or @dA and small?|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s8|pc|s2|pg||

mb|3S|mb|4C|mb|4S|mb|5C|nt|kit: If North passes and South doubles, declarer might work out the club position and get out for down 2.|pg||

pc|dT|pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ritong: talking about controls, do you think that 4@h by south over 4@c would gurantee @h control?|pg||
