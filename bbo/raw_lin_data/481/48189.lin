mc|11|nt|ahollan1: well belladonna did start out playing roman  and garozzo was from different city|pg||
nt|kareno: That or vice versa - actually I forget but one of them ALWAYS opened 2@d and the other ALWAYS 1@c|pg||
nt|ahollan1: restart time controlled by when other room finishes  then 10-15 min break|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i got to kibitz belladonna-forquet in a Reno Regional|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they were playing a version of Precision at the time  and 1st hand was an opening 2@D bid|pg||
nt|kareno: Lucky you!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unlucky  they had talked about switching meaning   one thought they agreed to the change the other thought they decided to wait|pg||
nt|ahollan1: disastrous board -- never a word spoken   opponents were a wreck for the rest of the set|pg||
nt|kareno: You couldn't mistake one for the other!  Giorgio was a huge bear of a man and Benito a tidy small one.|pg||
nt|swanson:  Andrew Gumperz and I will be doing voice commentary for the final set.  Not certain which room.|pg||

nt|RDS Reno: For the non-expert specs:  Since 2@D by E would have been a strong bid (a reverse), 3@D was a splinter bid ... Heart support, single diamond, strong hand.|pg||
