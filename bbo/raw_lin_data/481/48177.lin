nt|ahollan2: the reason meck asked about 3@D  is that EW play 2-way stayman|pg||
nt|ahollan2: 1N-2@D = FG stayman   1N-2@C = nf stayman|pg||

mb|3N|an|stiff spade|mb|p|nt|kareno: As do I.  Here my 3@d would be invitational|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Schermer alerts 3NT (I think--he pointed to it at least), but Chambers did not. Maybe he explained to Meck, though|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan2: EW initial action are more sound than most  so it still makes sense to use 2-way stayman opposite a stronger 1N than the rest of us use|pg||
nt|ahollan2: and easier to remember|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|Vugraphzfd: E-W play transfers by PH, not 2-way stayman|pg||

nt|ahollan2: ok  thx Oren   i'm updating my FD file now - that makes it OFFICIAL|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Meckstroth is asking questions aloud, both Schermer and Chambers are explaining. Maybe not exactly proper procedure, but fairrly common|pg||
