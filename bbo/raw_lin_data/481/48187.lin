pc|s2|pc|s4|pc|s6|pg||
nt|runnerup:  not many ,,but this is better than it looks like seeing only ns's cards ..east opened ..west passed|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sK|pc|sA|nt|kareno: Still east's hand will be behind declarer's|pg||

nt|ahollan1: other table still playing  28|pg||
nt|kareno: So, specs, you can wait for scores, go to the other room or just do as I will - take a nap and reclaim your seat in a few hours.|pg||
nt|runnerup:  tx all bye|pg||
nt|kareno: This room should remain open until the last scores filter in.|pg||

nt|ahollan2: which movie had live chess pieces and when one was taken, the winning piece would take out sword and decapitate?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe 3N here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: discussing that they make many tricks in hearts - Drew: "thought I had a normal weak 2 bid"|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: 5d also possible|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Drew: "I couldn't open 1@s, that's ridicuious ... if I was 6-4 I would have"|pg||
mb|1N!|mb|d|nt|ahollan2: everyone saying harry potter   but i was thinking something from the 1960s|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfb: now Drew is counting their tricks in hearts - or maybe losers,i'm not sure|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|s6|nt|RDS Reno: Even 6@D if no @H lead|pg||
nt|ahollan2: that 1N response was a game killer for NS|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Last board of this half. We will resume with the second half at 7:00 Orlando time, about 3 hours from now|pg||
nt|jrssd: looks like the 1N bid stole the pot, so to speak|pg||
pc|s5|nt|swanson:  South hand is maybe a bit strong for 3@D.  Rodwell did better at the other table, first passing 1@S doubled, then bidding 3@D.|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cJ|pc|cA|nt|ahollan2: even without it  i think meckwell did great job to reach 3N|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|pc|c2|pc|c9|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|dK|nt|ahollan2: or what John Swanson said  [must differentiate from John Schuler]|pg||
pc|h3|pc|cT|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Drew: "I had good support for you, Ralph" Katz: "no, I had good support for you"|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|pc|c8|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|jrssd: its obviously close to us, but partnership style is crucial in these borderline situations. How moch strength does Nort h need for the immediate double?|pg||
nt|swanson:  The North cards look much better knowing that partner has good spades (along with five diamonds).|pg||
nt|RDS Reno: Now another @S ... @D Jack will score|pg||
pc|s2|nt|marlowepi: some would overcall 2D imediately. that group includes me|pg||
nt|swanson:  You probably don't miss many games.|pg||
mc|10|nt|marlowepi: length in RHOs suit is sometimes thought a bad thing but i disagree. increes nchance of good trump support, and LHO canony ruff in front of dummy|pg||
