pc|dK|pc|d7|nt|swanson:  It was not necessary to cash a diamond - declarer's diamond(s) were going anywhere.|pg||

nt|RDS Reno: Since W's 1@C bid was artificial, N's 2@C bid was natural.|pg||
nt|swanson:  Without knowing the ins and outs of the E-W system, comments about how the bidding show go are a bit speculative...|pg||
nt|swanson:  but, it seems to me that West didn't really get the nature of his hand across to partner.|pg||
nt|swanson:  Maybe double of 2@C, then spades would be better.|pg||
nt|swanson:  I suppose the delay denies a singleton diamond.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Delay is Melman in the tank|pg||
nt|RDS Reno: N should be able to set up either his clubs or dummy's diamonds, escaping for -1|pg||
nt|swanson:  If West had not cashed the diamond ace, he could play a third spade (after declarer leads a diamond).  That forces declarer to take a ruff which doesn't held establish either suit.|pg||

pc|d8|pc|d2|pg||
nt|RDS Reno: The non-heart lead is quite puzzling.|pg||
