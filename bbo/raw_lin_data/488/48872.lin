nt|jesperdall:  Which Hanlon will play even faster than 3NT on the previous board|pg||
nt|vugraphzkg: NS not a regular partnership - so I am not absolutely sure how many agreements they have - but I am sure they have agreed to play KISS |pg||
nt|vugraphzkg: KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) :)|pg||
nt|jesperdall:  3NT was makeable with an impossible view in spades, finessing the nine|pg||
