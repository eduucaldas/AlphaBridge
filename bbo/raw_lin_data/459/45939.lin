pc|d5|nt|athene: running the @CJ will do it - if west wins |pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|nt|athene: if north runs to 2@D, west might well re-open that with a takeout double|pg||

nt|athene: not sure it will catch on|pg||
mb|p|mb|r|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: can you check the result from 3NT, operator?  probably just made 9 tricks not 12?|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|athene: another SOS redouble coming up from Helgemo now|pg||
nt|athene: ...or maybe not, if South bids some number of NT now|pg||
nt|athene: this situation is actually quite a well-known source of misunderstandings|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: the issue is:-|pg||
mb|r|nt|athene: when south passed 1@HX, did that set up a force?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: because that can affect the meaning of subsequent doubles|pg||
nt|athene: i wonder if Helgemo's auction showed diamonds at least as good as clubs (and with clubs better he would bid 1NT to run away, rather than redouble?)|pg||
nt|athene: the problem with that is, you lose the option of playing 1NT|pg||
mb|3D|mb|d|nt|athene: now obviously north must think that his side is in a force|pg||
nt|athene: otherwise he would just pass 2@D|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: the problem with these auctions, where someone passes a takeout double for penalties (as south did here after 1@hX) is that you haven't guaranteed the balance of the HCP|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Street had to borrow a pass card from Helgemo|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: so if the opponents then run away, you may not know what is forcing|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d9|pc|d2|pg||
nt|athene: declarer has a lot of work to do here|pg||
nt|athene: in theory he might be able to come to 4 hearts 3 spades and 2 clubs|pg||
pc|cT|nt|athene: but the defence have so much control, they ought to be able to scupper him somehow|pg||
nt|athene: maybe get their club trick set up before he can get it away on the long spade|pg||
nt|athene: Helness has the advantage that he knows (from the bidding) pretty much exactly what shape his partner has|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|pc|cK|pg||
pc|d5|nt|athene: ok|pg||
nt|athene: this is sort of a scissors coup|pg||
nt|athene: trying to kill west's entry to his club|pg||
nt|athene: but west can win this and play a spade and get a spade ruff|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dT|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|athene: this is a jolly interesting hand :)|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c2|pc|c6|pc|cA|pg||
nt|athene: ok, Helgemo failed to find the killing spade shift|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|hQ|nt|athene: very rare for him|pg||
nt|athene: never mind - Helgemo is a cheery fellow; i am sure he will survive this emotionally|pg||
nt|vugraphzfv: Thinking|pg||
nt|athene: i am getting a lot of queries about the word "scupper"|pg||
nt|athene: maybe it is just a British-ism|pg||
nt|athene: it means to destroy, wreck, defeat|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h5|pc|h9|pc|hT|pg||
nt|athene: Helness perhaps wondering what order to play his heart spots to tell his partner he has messed it up|pg||
nt|athene: now just a small spade from hand looks simplest|pg||
nt|athene: as the cards lie he can also ruff the @DJ, draw trumps and play spades, as east is out of diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: east can hold up his @SK for a while, but not long enough|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dK|pc|h8|pc|d4|pg||
nt|athene: if declarer takes two spade finesses, both holding, he won't take a third!|pg||
pc|hK|pc|d3|pc|c7|pc|h6|pg||
mc|9|nt|athene: firstly because he doesn't need a third spade finesse; secondly because helgemo would have responded with the @SK|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: now we are caught|pg||
nt|chorush: sound bidders would think the hearts too skimpy for a vulnerable v NV overcall; the modern tendency is to bid on everything|pg||

mb|2S|an|?|mb|p|nt|chorush: IMO Zimmerman's hand too strong for 3 hearts. In the US, 3NT usually shows solid hearts and not quite this good a hand. So what will he do. He cannot risk bidding 2NT|pg||
