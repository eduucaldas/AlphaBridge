mc|10|nt|Vugraphzff: we are out of boards since the other room has been so slow.  Calling director to see what he wants to do.|pg||
nt|swanson:  From experience, directors solution is to throw out the boards.  It's sort of like when a horse gets injured.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: we will wait to see the progress at the other table.  For now we are on a break.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i thought the rule was that only the slow table got to take a break|pg||
nt|kareno: I was on a committee once where Paul Soloway took a pee break and they went into overtime.  We asked if he had any ulterior motive for taking the break and he shrugged and said, "I ...|pg||
nt|kareno: had to pee."  end of story|pg||
nt|ahollan1: did someone write that line for him?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry  couldn't think of anything funnier [or at all funny?]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: as good a time as any to mention  long dinner break at halftime|pg||
nt|swanson:  An ethical question.  Let's say your opponents have been excessively slow and has been noticed by the director.  Do you slow down your play so that they will be penalized?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php   shows schedule calculated to your electronic device's timezone|pg||
nt|kareno: NO and that was the point of the Soloway committee - his opponents were penalized and claimed he only took the break to get the penalty.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: John hits upon one reason "chess clocks" not a real solution to slow play problems|pg||
nt|swanson:  It's possible that your side's bids and plays created difficult problems for the opponents that didn't happen at the other table.  The problem is very subjective.|pg||
nt|swanson:  I'm in favor of chess clocks in bridge.  Each side has so much time regardless of the difficultiy of the deals.  After that, penalties are automatic.|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  25 [4@SE-2] Diamond 5@DX - 500   another 12 for Fleisher|pg||
nt|kareno: I agree - no one should be able to force a session into overtime because of overly slow play.|pg||
nt|swanson:  Regardless of the board situation, after this much delay it should be possible to get boards 29 and 30 to this room for play.  They could even be duplicated by hand if necessary.  It's my lunch time.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: flip side   fast players covering for slow players is also wrong  so this is brutally difficult problem|pg||
nt|kareno: Why is that wrong, Al?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: John  one of my issue with clocks is  who gets charged when questions are asked?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think if slow play is bad, then it is bad regardless of pace of opponents|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i fear slow players go unpunished because faster players make session time look ok|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm being asked if 29 & 30 might be thrown out because other table slow|pg||
nt|ahollan1: did Joe mention that possibility?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if so  i HATE having fast table leave and possibly having to come back to play last 2 boards|pg||
nt|swanson:  By not allowing this table to play the boards now, it insures the maximum time to complete the set (if it is completed).|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: yes, that is the possibility, not a near certainty.   They don't like a board being played at only one table, so they pull boards in case the slow table doesn't catch up.  Bd 29 ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: and 30 are not here now|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: director here giving us 29.  We will play that board now.|pg||

nt|Vugraphzff: so director will allow 29 to be played in both rooms, regardless of how long they take in other room.  (Apparently no one is concerned about my dinner:))|pg||

mc|11|nt|ahollan1:  27 [6@HS=]  platnick stops in 5@H|pg||
nt|swanson:  Next hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: that was fast|pg||
nt|ahollan1: reminds me of boot camp where the mantra was         Hurry Up And Wait|pg||
nt|kareno: And no one bid 5@s - Heitner's Law rules!!!|pg||
nt|swanson:  Rather than play 30, maybe E-W and N-S could each select one of the previous boards to be replayed.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: much cooler today|pg||
nt|swanson:  The loss for the 800 set on board 26 was minimized because E-W at the other table bid to 3NT with paltry assets and didn't get a club lead.|pg||
nt|swanson:  If board 29 was taken from the other room, then returned in the short time it took to play it here, the other table will know it was (evidently) flat.|pg||
nt|swanson:  The 55 IMP lead enjoyed by Fleisher at this point is substantial - especially against a team which is playing well.|pg||
nt|swanson:  We have seen larger margins overcome, but it still unexpected.|pg||
nt|kareno: All true.  Diamond needs somehow to change the flow of this match|pg||
nt|swanson:  The 'Diamond' team will be representing the U.S. in the world championships the fall in Poland.  So let's hope they have a lot of fight left in them.|pg||
nt|swanson:  this fall|pg||
nt|kareno: I'm sure even if they lose here (to a fine team by the way) they'll be ready for Wraclaw|pg||

mb|p|mb|4N|nt|swanson:  I think they owe it to us to bid it, seeing how long we have waited.|pg||
nt|kareno: Spade finesse and correct choice of minor (without setting up diamond first).  Yes, 12 tricks but not appealing slam|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: 2@H was bal 14+|pg||
nt|kareno: Specs - I do see the spade finesse :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: did i say 2@H = 12-13??    |pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: might get a spade lead as well|pg||
nt|kareno: Next spec who tells me about the spade finesse gets a demerit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it is 14+   some flip-flop meaning of 2@H/2N   it always makes more sense to me to play 2@H as weaker   i should look at hand before describing those bids :(|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s3|pc|s5|nt|swanson:  If so, then 5@S could be used as signoff, forcing 5NT, and an immediate 5NT can be used to investigate a suit fit.|pg||
