nt|odysseus69: interesting hand to start - will declare from North maybe|pg||
nt|kareno: I've watched Hampson and Greco through many sessions - they are not only a great pair but also honest and very forthcoming about their system and implications of their bids.|pg||
nt|jgc: It did - Patrick was president of IBPA for 14 years and editor for 20 years before that|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|kareno: And of course Moss/Grue an exciting partnership to watch.|pg||
mb|4S|nt|odysseus69: I played with him, in the same team and against him for 50 years- he was full of life in June in Budapest|pg||
nt|jgc: Patrick died early Thu a.m. A few days earlier, cheerful as ever, he was insisting they release hin from hospital so that he could make his regular Thu eve bridge game|pg||
