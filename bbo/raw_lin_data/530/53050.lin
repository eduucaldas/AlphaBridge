pc|s3|pc|sQ|pc|s6|pc|s2|pg||

nt|lmilne:  For those asking, Raptop 1NT is an artificial 1NT overcall showing a long minor and a four-card major. Of course the cost is not being able to bid a natural 1NT|pg||

nt|vugraphc1: If the official playing time is exceeded, and the players do not agree which team was slow, TDs will look at camera imagery and assign penalties|pg||

nt|ahollan2: by the time feedback from draft - readers all thought zz was the real name|pg||
nt|ahollan2: so it stuck|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|lmilne:  Nice one, Al|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ahollan2: now  zz = AKQ = 321 points|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N!|nt|sommer:  congrats to USA2, tnx all|pg||
nt|lmilne:  So this is a big last hand for us to finish the match|pg||
nt|ahollan2: 1N = 15-17|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|nt|lmilne:  It looks impossible, but for France to win this they will need to score net 2250 which will require something redoubled, two down I think|pg||
mb|5N|nt|lmilne:  7@D is the bidding challenge contract|pg||
nt|sommer:  it's realy great to be able to bid 7@D with these cards|pg||
nt|sommer:  5+1+5+2=13|pg||
nt|Psyck:  Robson-Gold in the Transnationals bid this: 1N-2@h-3@s-4@c-4@d-4N-5@h-6@c-7@d-P|pg||
nt|lmilne:  7@D is possible to bid with imagination. And Moss isn't lacking in that department|pg||
mb|p|nt|lmilne:  Fantastic, thank you for that auction|pg||
mb|7S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lmilne:  Wow, what drama|pg||
nt|lmilne:  France are going to lose by 2 IMPs.|pg||
nt|vugrapho1: ty all for be with us! |pg||
nt|lmilne:  What a finish. |pg||
nt|ahollan2: 4@H re-transfer after super-accept // 4N=RKC  // 2 KC no Q // 5N = we have all 5 keycards + Q - try for grand slam|pg||
pc|s6|nt|lmilne:  Congratulations to your 2017 Bermuda Bowl champions, USA2: Marty Fleisher, Chip Martel, Brad Moss, Joe Grue, Jacek Pszczola and Michael Rosenberg, NPC Jan Martel!|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|h3|pc|sJ|pc|s9|pg||
pc|sT|pc|h5|pc|s4|nt|ahollan2: if my math correct -- this ends as 2 imp win for usa2|pg||
nt|sommer:  17 imps only|pg||
nt|eamongall: you are correct Al ..and even a double of 7@S ..is still same 17 imps |pg||

nt|lmilne:  This will be a sinking feeling for Moss and Grue, who may think they have lost it on the last board|pg||
nt|lmilne:  Indeed, the last board was possibly a swing out as well|pg||
nt|sommer:  ...it ends as close it has been all the way... 3 very amusing days with a lot of great bridge, tnx for that|pg||
nt|medwards:  Yes very entertaining|pg||
nt|lmilne:  As so often these days, it came down right to the very end|pg||

mb|p|mb|4C|nt|kit:  And finishing off with a slam -- grand is close, but doesn't quite come in.|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|nt|kit:  Unless you are good enough to get to 7@D, that is|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ahollan1: and in 2016  he was on winning team in world championship senior team|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5H|nt|ahollan1: oops  1982  rosenblum  not bb|pg||
