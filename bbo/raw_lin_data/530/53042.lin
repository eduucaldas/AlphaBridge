nt|bobholl: or is he thinking whether the underlead migth cost :)|pg||
nt|kareno: The common wisdom is that with the ace the shift comes quickly.  He must be deciding which red suit to lead|pg||

nt|kit:  QJ of diamonds look like 2 more tricks on defense than on offense|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|hK|pc|c4|pc|h3|pg||
nt|kareno: He needed short nine of hearts|pg||
nt|bobholl: if you count those @D for 2 does partner promise 3 tricks (the fact that 2 @D X isn't game makes it easier)|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|nt|kit:  The opponents have to take 8 tricks to make 2@D.  Where are those tricks coming from?|pg||

nt|belerophon: il aurais pu trouver l entame d@d , meme apres l'intervention ( apres passe et vert ) de son p .|pg||
nt|Bernard25: l'Imp qui manque va devenir important!!!!!!|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  This is also an interesting board.  If North is known to bid 1@S on that hand, then South should lead his suit!|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  i.e. diamonds|pg||
nt|aardv:  i wonder if East might have momentarily been on the wrong system when he opened 1@D|pg||
nt|ahollan2:  15  combescure opened 2N = 19-20|pg||

nt|belerophon: Este apris la mauvaise ligne , mais Fred n'as pas trouvé le switch |pg||
nt|bjacobs:  All right, I'm going to have a nice lie down.  Moss handed the contract back, but reasonably, South thought North had the @SQ|pg||
nt|belerophon: il ne connait pas les 5@c chez le declarant faut dire |pg||
