mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|lmilne:  Mihov had a very similar hand on the first board of this set|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  you might be able to help me understand this. Does the first seed set the bracket, as in choose their semi-final opponent from a quarter-final matchup? And if both USAs advance, that takes priority over the first seed's selection?|pg||
mb|d|mb|2H!|nt|lmilne:  I believe the bracket is set to match the Americans at the QF stage|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  okay thanks, that makes sense|pg||
nt|lmilne:  I watched the video where the teams chose their opponents and it looked as though it was done automatically|pg||
nt|lmilne:  2@H = good raise of spades|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|nick jacob:  here Karakolev has found the eight-card fit. he still doesn't have enough to barrel into game. but he could involve partner with a delicate 3@D bid|pg||
mb|3H|nt|nick jacob:  I'm a little surprised Cornell didn't compete to 3@S over 3@D|pg||
nt|lmilne:  Does 3@D show a heart fit? It's still possible for the hearts to be a 4-3 fit|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  agreed, it is a murky bid|pg||
nt|lmilne:  Mihov seems sure that partner doesn't have four hearts and five-plus diamonds, at least|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lmilne:  For some Precision pairs, this would certainly not suggest an eight-card heart fit|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  he possibly isn't aware of the game-interest connotations|pg||
nt|lmilne:  If Cornell bids, I think he will buy it|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  even for some Standard pairs, too|pg||
nt|lmilne:  Which would be a win for NZL. If NS bid on to 4@H, a loss, and if Cornell passes, an IMP or two to Bulgaria most likely|pg||
mb|p|nt|lmilne:  Interesting to manage 4@H though - you do have to pick up the diamonds. And if the @SA is knocked out early, you might have to pick it|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|lmilne:  You can actually make 11 tricks by drawing two rounds of trumps, then running diamonds to throw spades|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C|nt|nick jacob:  West's hand is a little tricky to bid after a 1@S overcall|pg||
nt|lmilne:  Indeed. I have heard of some pairs - perhaps Auken/Welland? - using jump bids to show awkward two-suited hands, a novel treatment|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2D|nt|lmilne:  Diamonds will be better for EW - they won't find out they are off a keycard and the queen of trumps (for hearts) :)|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|nick jacob:  it is useful to have a meaning for these jumps, especially over a frequently short 1@C|pg||
nt|lmilne:  EW might well play this in 4@H though|pg||
mb|p|nt|lmilne:  West has an awkward problem. Bit extra for just 4@H|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  this might not be a bad time for Bach to pull the trigger|pg||
nt|lmilne:  That said, 4@H should show a good hand here. With a limited hand and 5-6 shape, West would probably start with 2@H the previous roudn|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  vulnerable opponents have competed to 3@S; likely partner has minimal wastage|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  yes this is true|pg||

nt|lmilne:  Perhpas 5@H here? Not too hot, not too cold?|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  it's a little scary though, you may bypass your better contract|pg||
nt|lmilne:  I doubt Ashley will risk a double, worried about all pass|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  partner can hardly raise to 4@D on a weak NT|pg||

nt|lmilne:  You can watch Cornell agonise with us: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sW2_AgWejTA|pg||
nt|lmilne:  5@H is a big old bid, isn't it?|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  very important to reassess this hand. It started as a terrible 4333. the opponents bid and raised the @SQJx, where partner is void. partner seems to hold 0562 or longer|pg||

mb|6D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|nick jacob:  partner is basically forcing to 6@D opposite no heart support, too|pg||

mb|1S|nt|nick jacob:  okay that's better|pg||
nt|lmilne:  The Suction we've all come to know and love|pg||
nt|lmilne:  It will be harder for East-West to find 7@C if they don't know they have clubs|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  so this should show either 5@H or 4@S 4+@C|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  the double, that is|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  Cornell has an excellent hand opposite either shape|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  they typically bid as naturally as possible|pg||
nt|lmilne:  At the other table, Bulgaria found their clubs, but only bid them to the five level. It's very hard to offer up a likely 1100 by saving at the seven level, vulnerable|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  I wouldn't be surprised to see a 3@C bid from Cornell, or a 2@D cuebid|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  obviously he has no values for the latter|pg||
nt|lmilne:  The big fit (of some sort) and the lack of values would argue for a jump|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|nick jacob:  well I didn't want to believe it, but I did suggest it so I'll take the blame|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|nick jacob:  Ash has no interest, and Cornell will have found a way to not discover what suit his partner holds|pg||
nt|lmilne:  3@D is interesting - possibly denying three spades? and a little bit conservative given Mihov's hand strength|pg||
nt|lmilne:  Karakolev is not passing this though|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  what would be your choice on his hand?|pg||
nt|lmilne:  A jump to 3@H would have been ideal on Cornell's hand, if it showed a hand that is worth 3@H opposite hearts or 4@C opposite clubs|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  maybe just a simple 4@D to setup some cues|pg||
