nt|Vugraphzfg: All three Diamond pairs play a version of Meckwell Lite Precision. I've played some with Platnick, so I know at least some of the secrets|pg||
mb|r|an|hearts|nt|Vugraphzfg: Transfers after 1@D (X) are virtually universal among the American precision pairs. Can't think of one who doesn't play it|pg||
mb|1N|nt|3for3:  NS 2/1...NS are two of the more conservative players in the event|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfg: Platnick's double of 1NT would have been support, I believe, but he wants an escape to use it. If partner has 4 hearts and a bad hand, they need to have a place to land|pg||
pc|h5|nt|Vugraphzfg: Kamil: "I have no trumps for you. I'll try to stick to the distribution you need."|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hJ|nt|3for3:  Becker will duck 2 hearts and kill the West hand...just a question of overtricks from there|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfg: E-W play very standard carding methods, but one twist they do is 3rd/5th in partner's suit, I think|pg||

pc|h7|pc|hA|pc|hQ|nt|Vugraphzfg: Becker: "You play standard suit preference?" Platnick: "Yes"|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|3for3:  Platnick has 13 HCP, but could easily have 11(10), so Becker cant be sure that Diamond is broke now|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Just a note on the E-W methods. The Diamond team never opens their artificial 1@D with fewer than 10 HCP. Different directors will give different rulings, but the players believe ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: that is illegal because you can't agree to play an artificial 1-level opening less than 10 HCP|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d9|pc|dK|pc|d3|pg||
