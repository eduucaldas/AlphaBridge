nt|Vugraphzfg: Yes, this looks like a clear Drury bid to me|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: I think Kamil forgot he was a passed hand momentarily. He put 2@S on the tray for a second and then took off the top three cards|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Probably tired. Played all the boards yesterday and the first two sets today|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Becker and Kamil have been the work horses of a team that was originally going to play 4-handed without them!|pg||
nt|fuquay:  It is interesting that he would have thought the hand worth only 2@S if he were unpassed put is worth Drury as a passed hand|pg||
nt|fuquay:  but|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Not that interesting, imo. Most players' Drury range starts at the upper end of a constructive raise--and some go lower|pg||
nt|3for3:  Agreed Oren.  There are plenty of hands that fit that divide|pg||
nt|3for3:  With drury you can show extras and finish at the 2 level opposite a minimum.|pg||
nt|3for3:  Not so if you show a LR in most methods...though some like 4 seat drury!|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Maybe it's different in a very sound style (Kamilesque) but for anyone who opens some 11-counts, you just won't have a HCP limit raise much as a passed hand, so very utility in ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: playing Drury the same range as your UPH limit raise|pg||
nt|3for3:  Do we need to check Becker's pulse?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Diamond asks if Becker has called a card already. Becker: "I fell asleep, thanks for waking me up." Diamond: "Seriously?" Becker: "No. I'm just having a lot of trouble here."|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Diamond: "Sorry, just making sure|pg||
nt|3for3:  Diamond and Becker on opposite sides of the screen, I assume|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Yes|pg||
nt|3for3:  I assume Becker is wondering whether to take his club pitch on the heart.|pg||
nt|fuquay:  If someone would tell Becker that spades split 3-2 (even if honors were split) he would not be taking so long :)|pg||
