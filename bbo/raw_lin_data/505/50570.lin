nt|warrens:  I'm not sure why Kamil played the 10 of @S here, but Becker has to decide if it's a singleton, in which case a shift might be in order, or a doubleton|pg||

nt|warrens:  his partner has shown up with @SAK, @DKQ and @CJ.  I think he can't have the @H K.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: He would be 4=1=4=4 though, so failure to open 1NT isn't a lock inference|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Kamil apologizes, puts his head in his hands|pg||
nt|warrens:  well, he could be 4144 in theory and have decided not to open 1NT with 16 (AKxx, K, KQxx, Jxxx), so it's not completely clear what to do|pg||
