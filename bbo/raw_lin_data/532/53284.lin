mb|3H|mb|p|nt|vugraphzew: Board 8 was 4H made|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham:  we can all see that 3NT makes, as the club finesse is onside and the spades are 4-4, but that doesn't make it a good contract |pg||
nt|vugraphzew: 'We'll get there' said Clench|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s3|nt|mdgraham:  unless your view of a good contract is one that makes|pg||

pc|s5|pc|s9|pc|sK|pc|s4|pg||
nt|mdgraham:  however, this was not an expected stopping point|pg||
nt|aardv:  This auction makes no sense to m|pg||
nt|aardv:  e|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|h5|pc|s6|pc|sT|pg||
nt|mdgraham:  suspect E thought 3@D was forcing after the (presumably) 4SF 2@s|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d5|pc|dQ|pc|d2|pg||
pc|d8|nt|aardv:  yes indeed|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dA|pc|d9|pg||
pc|dK|pc|h7|pc|dT|pc|d6|pg||
nt|aardv:  but from West's point of view, East had surely denied three hearts|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cJ|pc|c2|pc|c6|pg||
nt|mdgraham:  in which case, she was likely just denying a spade stopper|pg||
pc|cK|pc|h4|pc|c7|pc|c3|pg||
pc|s8|pc|hT|pc|sQ|pc|c5|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mdgraham:  however, given the result at the other table, whether this makes or not is largely irrelevant|pg||
nt|aardv:  2@S fourth suit really has to be GF|pg||
pc|c4|pc|h2|pc|h6|pg||
nt|aardv:  it won't make|pg||

nt|dburn:  same thing, really|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s2|pg||
nt|dburn:  mind you, this game might not have been bid without the pre-emptive opening|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s9|pc|sJ|pc|s4|pg||
pc|sK|nt|dburn:  2@d showed a bad weak two in a major, not by any means a misdescription|pg||
nt|joefawcett:  I don't know who would be more upset, Sally or Tony.|pg||
pc|c6|pc|sA|pc|sT|pg||
pc|s6|pc|h3|pc|s8|nt|joefawcett:  Apparently everything is set for match two to be on vugraph.|pg||
nt|dburn:  is this still the first match?|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|joefawcett:  Yes.|pg||
nt|vugraphzex: still the first match|pg||

mb|1C!|mb|p|nt|mdgraham:  good slam for EW - 6@d or 6NT|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|aardv:  how many boards are they playing David, how many have they played, and what's the score?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4D|nt|vugraphzew: Sorry don't know score|pg||
nt|vugraphzew: This is the last board|pg||
nt|mdgraham:  now 4@h from E and they should be there|pg||
nt|aardv:  thanks|pg||
nt|vugraphzew: Too busy trying to get things up and running|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|nt|mdgraham:  wrong prediction....|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|aardv:  4@H might have been offering 3-card support|pg||
nt|mdgraham:  maybe, but personally I think 4@d set trumps |pg||

nt|mdgraham:  cash-and-claim|pg||
nt|vugraphzew: If I caan I'll try to get the scores after the last board|pg||
nt|aardv:  you probably thought 3@H was forcing on the previous hand|pg||
nt|aardv:  thanks|pg||
