mb|1C!|mb|d|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|nick jacob:  Lavazza picked up 11 by staying in game when slam was okay, though odds against,  on board 6|pg||
mb|2C|mb|d|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|nick jacob:  these are the positions you want if you're an Oceania fan, though. different contracts, more possible swings|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|nick jacob:  although they'll need a lot more swings in the next 26 comparisons to keep this match alive|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s2|nt|nick jacob:  good decision from Whibley to advance with 1NT over the frequently short 1@C opening|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  had Brown's @CK been the @DK, 5@D would have had a real shot. here, though, Whibley is basically confined to playing for @DKQ doubleton|pg||

nt|nick jacob:  on board 6, the natural 2@D overcall may have caused South to downgrade his hand|pg||
