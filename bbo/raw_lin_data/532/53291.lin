mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn:  board 11 being flat, in 1NT down two here and 3@s down two in the other room|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s5|nt|dburn:  Brown not even inviting game, just in case partner has the usual filth for an opening bid these days|pg||

nt|dburn:  well, partner has a pretty decent hand and the lie is quite favourable|pg||
pc|d4|pc|c2|pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|dburn:  but the defence can get five tricks before declarer can get nine|pg||
pc|s4|pc|c4|pc|s9|pc|sA|pg||

mb|1H|mb|2D|mb|2H|nt|joefawcett:  The internet connection at the Young Chelsea is quite flaky.|pg||
nt|dburn:  not much of an overcall, that|pg||
mb|3H!|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d6|nt|dburn:  trouble is, the bidding might persuade West to lead a diamond|pg||
nt|dburn:  but the defence can still prevail as long as it does not panic|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|joefawcett:  Even on that lead it could be two down.|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d3|pg||
nt|joefawcett:  Sorry, one down as David says.|pg||
nt|dburn:  declarer should play clubs and hope the defence does panic and shift to spades|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h8|pc|hA|nt|joefawcett:  Maybe a @C next to try and induce a @S error.|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h2|pc|hK|pc|hT|pg||
nt|dburn:  but this is not going to induce a misdefence, since the defenders can see there is no communication to set up a club now|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|pc|dA|nt|dburn:  so West's overcall will show a profit in that it induced East's double - doubtless West would not have ventured 2@d with @s7 instead of @s8|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c9|pc|c4|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|c2|pc|h5|nt|joefawcett:  Apparently it made in the other room after East ducked the @S10 (not confirmed yet).|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c6|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|sT|nt|dburn:  in that case the profit will be limited to a single IMP, since down one would be 12 without the double and will be 13 with it|pg||

pc|d4|pc|dT|pc|dK|pc|d3|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d2|nt|dburn:  not that South was going to bid 4@h, of course|pg||
pc|dA|pc|c9|pg||
nt|joefawcett:  Flat board after two down in 4@D in the other room?|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|s4|pc|d9|pc|c5|pg||

pc|c7|pc|cJ|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
nt|dburn:  but North is resolutely throwing losers and keeping winners, always a difficult defence for declarer to counter|pg||

nt|dburn:  West would doubtless have overcalled with that, but East is exercising iron discipline|pg||
mb|3S|nt|joefawcett:  5@C also makes for E/W.|pg||
nt|dburn:  so is South - that looks like a 4@s bid to me|pg||
nt|dburn:  but maybe they are using four-card majors, though even so...|pg||
nt|joefawcett:  In the other room they splintered.|pg||
nt|dburn:  yes, of course they did - who wouldn't?|pg||

pc|c2|pc|c7|pg||
nt|dburn:  that may be down three|pg||
nt|dburn:  which will put Kater on the scoreboard at least|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|dburn:  Brown may be nervous of playing ace and a heart - she knows no one has @hKQx or she would have been doubled, but @hHxx is possible|pg||

mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|joefawcett:  One off, as was 4@S.|pg||

mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sA|nt|dburn:  seems normal, unless East wants to take a shot at 1@c doubled, but the vulnerability is against that|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s8|pc|s5|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|pc|s7|nt|dburn:  South might have to go up with the ace if declarer leads a low club towards the nine|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cA|pc|c9|nt|dburn:  but that would just be to prevent an overtrick|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dA|pc|d4|pc|d3|pg||
nt|dburn:  she made the right club play, but unfortunately the wrong spade play conceded the overtrick anyway|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h4|pc|hQ|pc|h3|pg||
nt|dburn:  reasonably enough,  mind - she probably needed a couple of spade tricks to beat the hand at all|pg||

nt|dburn:  so no overtricks after all|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d9|pc|dQ|nt|dburn:  there was one at the other table, so Kater will pick up an IMP, but that's a lot too little a lot too late|pg||

mb|4D|mb|p|nt|dburn:  Idon't think East intended 2@c as natural, but West must have thought it was|pg||
mb|5C|nt|dburn:  and East, who has pretty good support for clubs for someone who was just control-bidding, is now looking for six|pg||
