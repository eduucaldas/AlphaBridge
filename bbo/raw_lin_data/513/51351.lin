nt|mike_G:  Warne - Bergdahl (who used to play together until this year) were getting some bad results after opening 2@C/@D|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D!|mb|1S|mb|2C|mb|3S|nt|mike_G:  That South got to make 3NT looks silly but I suspect that 3NT normally promises a spade stopper over the double|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mike_G:  Actually, 6@C goes down on two rounds of spades from the defence|pg||
pc|s9|nt|mike_G:  That takes away an entry to dummy and diamonds can't be set up|pg||
nt|mike_G:  All of that is hypothetical as NS stop in 5@C|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sK|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|mike_G:  After his negative 1@D maybe North could have tried 4@S over 3@S?|pg||
nt|mike_G:  If the @SQJ was the @HK or @DQ, slam would be great|pg||
nt|mike_G:  But I do think that 1@D is 0-9 so he is not quite maximum|pg||
