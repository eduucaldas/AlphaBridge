nt|ritong: right  i also doubt they will stop that low here|pg||
nt|chip: yes, or 4H. though I guess opposing bidding suggested things weren't splitting.|pg||
nt|dburn:  or 3NT for the matter of that|pg||
nt|ritong: they might have some two suited azggressive opening for south|pg||
nt|dburn:  my experience of juniors is that just because they do a lot of bidding, there is no particular reason to expect bad breaks|pg||
nt|ritong: now, say south opens 1@h, may go 1@h 2@d double 3@d swish|pg||
nt|chip: actually, 3N is a game that could make (if guess D's).|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|2D!|nt|ritong: but, as expected, they do have some blitz stuff|pg||
mb|4D!|nt|dburn:  looks like a Multi|pg||
nt|dburn:  rather than Ekren, showing boh majors|pg||
nt|chip: seems so, though looking at S hand could have been majors.|pg||
nt|chip: guess 4D is D+ major.|pg||
nt|dburn:  so 4@d is diamonds and a major|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|dburn:  whether or not it is forcing I do not know, but...|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn:  ...North will now assume South has spades....|pg||
nt|dburn:  or may do, at any rate|pg||
mb|4S|mb|d|nt|chip: is DBL by N here pass/correct?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn:  it's a question of whether his double now is pass or correct|pg||
nt|chip: I guess not or he could do that rather than bid 4S.|pg||
nt|chip: was rather lucky to hit 4 card support.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ritong: sort of|pg||
nt|dburn:  indeed - this could have been a lot worse|pg||
pc|dT|nt|chip: for once USA will win imps for doubling the opponents (assuming they can collect their tricks).|pg||
nt|dburn:  I think East should have led a trump - not sure if it makes any difference, but it looks a more workmanlike lead|pg||

nt|dburn:  mind you, he may have been hoping that partner could push a trump through from his side - the opponents won't always have a 4-4 fit on this bidding|pg||
nt|chip: I'd have thought most likely N had 3 and S 5.|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|ritong: six on a very windy day:)|pg||
nt|chip: and a 14 card suit?|pg||
nt|chip: or is that the windy part?|pg||
nt|ritong: it is|pg||
nt|ritong: roughly south is supposed to hold some form of weak 2@s|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h8|pc|sA|pc|cT|pg||

nt|dburn:  3-5 is barely possible, but the actual disaster is a far more frequent occurrence|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|mb|3H!|mb|p|nt|ritong: isn t that a clear simple raise|pg||

nt|chip: down 2 in 3S was not great declarer play. Looks like 8 top tricks and heart guess for 9.|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cJ|nt|chip: my guess is that 4S will go down only 1, so Netherlands will gain 3 imps.|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C|nt|dburn:  again, East-West did pretty well to stay as low as they did|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|2C|nt|ritong: this time east has an abvious penalty pass, for a change|pg||
nt|dburn:  though I suppose that 1@h overcall slowed things down a bit|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ritong: doubling 2@s shows a penalty hand for @hs imo|pg||
nt|dburn:  actually, South at the other table opened the bidding|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn:  so East-West were disinclined to venture very high|pg||
