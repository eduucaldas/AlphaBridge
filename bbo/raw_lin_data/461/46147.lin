mb|1C|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|grebrof: an option is to play the @sJ at trick 1, but when the @s 10 is in the dummy, that didnt seem enterprizing|pg||

pc|h3|nt|grebrof: 3rd hand opening deserves that suit lead - I would never dbl with Ns hand, but ok|pg||
nt|jbgood:  will that induce declarer to go wrong in trumps?|pg||
nt|grebrof: declarer might play N for the @s Q|pg||
nt|Vugraphzmt: will see in a moment, if he get's trumps right, declerer should ride home with 2@c and 2@d loosers|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h9|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|pc|s3|pc|h5|pg||
pc|c6|nt|grebrof: some speculates that N will be endplayed in @ds, but I think S will play @D when in on both AK of @cs|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|pc|c9|pg||
pc|dT|nt|jbgood:  rarely a double made for declarer to find the trump queen - so most like just double on points - but ...|pg||

pc|d6|pc|d3|pc|dQ|pc|d9|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dJ|pc|h7|pc|d4|pg||
nt|grebrof: another thing is that S will be marked with a dblton @d now, so maybe @s are 2-2|pg||
pc|d8|nt|grebrof: but...|pg||
nt|grebrof: what now?|pg||
nt|jbgood:  declarer getting the picture I think |pg||
nt|grebrof: N K or Q of @h - A, K or Q of @C + KQ of @ds - S starting to look favorite to hold te @s Q|pg||
nt|jbgood:  N likely to have a heart honor - does he have the club queen or the spade queen? |pg||
pc|sA|nt|grebrof: next card can be worth 300.000nkr the balcony says - well, this is not the only card where a "mistake" has been made, but this is all in or all out|pg||

pc|d2|pc|d9|pc|dQ|pc|d4|pg||

nt|grebrof: not sure what Ns rush was playing @ds - could be an enourmous loss of tempo|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d5|pc|dK|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|grebrof: now declarer has a sure @d trick|pg||
nt|jbgood:  communication problems makes the club finese through N a must since declarer needs 2 entries to establish hearts and cashing them|pg||

nt|grebrof: you would never see declarer play on @ds like that without the help he got|pg||

mc|9|nt|Vugraphzmt: we have a big bridgemate problem, so big that score slips are handed out|pg||
nt|jbgood:  4@c was well bid - if prd has a spade stack he is likely to double 4 spades, and if not, you still can save (as he did)|pg||
nt|grebrof: the balcony gives 100% blame to E, so we finally agree on something|pg||
nt|jbgood:  :)|pg||
nt|grebrof: bridgemate server broken down - results will be updated later|pg||

nt|grebrof: updated after 108 boards - we have played 111: http://bridge.no/var/ruter/html/9901/2016maritsveaas.htm|pg||
nt|Vugraphzmt: why not entertain us a bit while waiting? do you know any bridge related jokes? or funny stories? the best ones will be published if break wiil be long enough|pg||
nt|grebrof: I know only one joke, but I dont remember it now|pg||
nt|Vugraphzmt: firstly the break was just a 5 minutes break to refresh and get rid of any delays we had, but now it's more about fixing bridgemates|pg||
nt|Vugraphzmt: main TD: we are almost ready to start playing. All players be ready in 5 minutes|pg||
nt|grebrof: the finale results will be scored later since the bridgemate server broke down|pg||
nt|grebrof: so they have to be scored manually - like we did it in the "old" days|pg||
nt|jbgood:  just 3 more rounds to go - we are due for an exciting finish|pg||
nt|grebrof: 3 rounds the old way is just charming I guess - bridgeplayers are getting lazier every day|pg||
nt|grebrof: people are saying this only happens in Norway - I dont think so - at least here we can understand who wins when the scores are at a website|pg||
