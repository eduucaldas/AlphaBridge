pc|s8|nt|grebrof: most people lead to the short hand first, but here you have entryproblems after drawing trumps, so maybe the @c 9 will run. my guess is 11|pg||
pc|h9|nt|grebrof: cashing 1 high trump in hand first would have been better|pg||

mc|10|nt|Vugraphzmt: 4 minutes til next round|pg||
nt|jbgood:  live result entries indicates that NS came out on top in this battle|pg||
nt|grebrof: if your object is to play 4rounds of @s, cashing A or K in trumps seems better - if ruffing the 3rd (like I thought he would), better not to cash any high trumps first|pg||
nt|grebrof: http://bridge.no/var/ruter/html/9901/2016maritsveaas.htm|pg||
nt|grebrof: EW you mean|pg||
nt|grebrof: not by a lot thou|pg||
nt|grebrof: 12 tricks 3nt was worth 75%ish - the others 60-70% for EW|pg||
nt|jbgood:  sure was rather average - I "misread" one of the results:(|pg||
nt|Vugraphzmt: we're still missing EW, director is urging players to take places, so we should start soon|pg||
nt|grebrof: I have to start on my toes to count the misreading parts from this last week - this is much more difficult that people think - thankfully we arent only critizised|pg||

mb|p!|mb|2C|mb|2H|nt|jbgood:  my guess is that your guess is correct:)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|grebrof: what was Ss pass? are they playing some kind of limited Major bids?|pg||
nt|jbgood:  with 3 cards in the majors, not everybody would balance in the W seat - but unlikely that any other player will be in that pos|pg||
nt|Vugraphzmt: there was some discussion on both sides of the screen, but unfortunately I couln't overhear a thing|pg||
nt|jbgood:  looks like a strong club by NS since S passed|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|grebrof: in Denmark and Sweden they are more likely to have systems where 1Major is 9-14 or something like that. obviously works out fine|pg||
