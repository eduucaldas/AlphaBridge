nt|vugraphzgj: Hello everyone|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|kareno: Lots of distribution today.  Still a close match though it turned around in the last two boards of the previous set.|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|mikeh:  3C is always a suspect jumpshift, so 4H here should be passed|pg||
nt|vugraphzgj: Jeff is now in the tank|pg||
nt|mikeh:  the danger is that S has those 2 aces and can't be sure partner isn't, for example, Ax AKQxxx x KQxx|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|kareno: Six isn't very good but will make with a good heart guess.|pg||
nt|mikeh:  one possible treatment is to use 3D over 3C as a waiting bid|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|mb|6C|mb|p|nt|kareno: Spade lead will beat an unlikely 6@c|pg||
nt|kareno: Is this a relatively new partnership?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgj: Yes|pg||
nt|kareno: In a practiced one this should not be a difficult auction|pg||
nt|mikeh:  Jeff Blond has been playing the CNTC, off and on, for many years, but I don't know Davidson|pg||
nt|vugraphzgj: been friends for years..but never played in anything like this together|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|dQ|nt|mikeh:  even a diamond lead causes problems, unless N makes an inspired heart play|pg||
nt|mikeh:  he needs to use a second entry to hook the clubs a second time|pg||
nt|vugraphzgj: this may take awhile :)|pg||
nt|mikeh:  it will no doubt be slow at this trick, but in reality there isn't much to the play. He needs clubs 3=3, with East holding at least one honour|pg||

nt|kareno: The defense to Roman 2@d is pass and lead trump|pg||
pc|h7|nt|kareno: That play will toughen up a defender!|pg||
nt|mikeh:  two points here: S can play the 10, because of the 3rd best lead, and declarer is in no hurry to play the K, since he knows where the Ace is|pg||
nt|kareno: No one underleads aces?  |pg||
