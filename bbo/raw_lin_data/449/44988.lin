mb|p|nt|swanson:  6NT (rather than 6@S) protected the red suit tenaces (if North was missing either king).|pg||
nt|swanson:  protects|pg||
nt|marlowepi: for many players the N hand is just too good for 2S, clearly this N is one of them|pg||

nt|chip: yes, I did a Bridge Today article on opener bidding 3C on all minimum hands (as responder usually then just bids 3N and gives away no info).|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|marlowepi: true but that was awfully committal. X for example was cheap and assuredly not penalty|pg||
mb|p|nt|agumperz:  right|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|d|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: One thing is however undeniable. Had S passed, N would not have bid 5D at her next turn and probably they would have ended in 3N, giving N a chance to follow to the first trick ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: with the spade knave|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|vugraphzfj: so far an identical auction, question is can EW stay out of 3n|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|swanson:  Thanks everyone - our expert vugraph operator Kevin Rosenberg, fellow commentators Marshall Lewis, Chip Martel, Andrew Gumperz.  Plus BBO, USBF, vugraph organizer Jan Martel.|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|nt|marlowepi: they certainly should after 3D-3H-3S|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: now perhaps EW are in a familiar type of uncertainty  .. have they definitively agreed a strain or are there still multiple balls in teh air?|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: Sokolow: "sorry, I couldn't read the 8 of hearts" |pg||
nt|ritong: ah yes  it did|pg||
nt|chip: 6C is better than 3N I think.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in context of checkback mechanisms - i don't understand OBLIGATORY 1@S rebid over 1@H when holding 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: none of this is real - all memorex|pg||
nt|ahollan1: last board of the set|pg||

nt|chip: well does allow you to find a spade fit when responder is too weak to look over 1N. However, I think having 1S promise shape is a better method.|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|d|nt|ahollan1: thru Q3  Wittes 139 vs OSMO 60    [different boards]|pg||

pc|d8|nt|ahollan1: and this is why a BBO software solution is needed|pg||
mc|7|nt|Vugraphzfb: Sorry!|pg||
nt|ritong: 50 years of routine can not vanish that easily|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: we'll probably start again shortly after the other table finishes.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: having to undo all AND remember AND reenter auction is too brutal -- especially since you then lose ability to record the play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nuke 1 bid, insert a pass, replace 1 bid  would be great improvement for operator|pg||
nt|ahollan1: open room on final board - with same auction thru 3@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but Cappelletti rebid 3@S where Seamon-Molson bid 3N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: winners of today's 60-board matches advance to SemiFinal with 1 day off|pg||
