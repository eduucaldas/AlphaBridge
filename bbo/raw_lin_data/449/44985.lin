mb|p|mb|2S|nt|ritong: 2@h then 4NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: east accepting|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: well|pg||
mb|p|pc|h3|nt|chip: 3N may seem conservative, but note that E has a max and slam is 50-50. Take away D9 and worse than that.|pg||

nt|chip: EW were lucky on 27 for staying out of a good slam that went down. Here unlucky missing a 50-50 one that makes.|pg||
nt|ritong: for what it is worth, EW next room made an inviting auction with the same basic elements|pg||
nt|chip: now making 7 to save an imp (10 instead of 11).|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: last board of the 1st half|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|an|GF|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|ahollan1: great job as always from our operator Kevin Rosenberg|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|swanson:  Maybe 4NT invite by West and accept by East?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and thanks to John Swanson for jumping in to TYPE  [a 4-letter word] |pg||
nt|vugraphzfj: we'll most likely be swtiching amtches next half assuming it stays closer than this one|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|mb|6N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: but still just a short break, right?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfj: im not sure|pg||
nt|ahollan1: schedule says  restart in 20|pg||
nt|swanson:  From West's point of view, this could easily be on one of two finesses (and therefore a 75% slam).|pg||
nt|vugraphzfj: seems doubtful to me but maybe|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but i'm looking at wrong event :(|pg||

nt|vugraphzfj: odd AH lead|pg||
pc|c8|nt|vugraphzfj: but does give DIsa some losing options|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so i'm with Kevin in believing we'll see the other match for 2nd half|pg||

nt|ahollan1: btw  Open rom is just starting  27   so if you're not ready for late lunch break - you can go there for a few|pg||

nt|ahollan1: but Jan is operator in the slow room  so we'll have to wait to hear about 2nd match|pg||
