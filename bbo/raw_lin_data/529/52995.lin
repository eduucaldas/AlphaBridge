mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C|nt|fabsayc:  Zia having opened 2@S showed the void over 4NT but they still stopped in 6|pg||

mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|ahollan1: martel 2@S would have been constructive   i was not sure if he would do that or open 3@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h5|nt|fuquay:  Here 3N goes down with a @S lead and duck --- very unlikely; could also go down on club misguess; 2N is dull :)|pg||

pc|cT|pc|c7|pc|cQ|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|c4|nt|CorpLaw:  at other table, N overcalled hearts, so S wasn't expecting W to have 2 stoppers in H, and N might have only had 1 spade|pg||

nt|ahollan1: windoze  movie does not show  bidding/play for other room  but  browser movie does have that info - sure hope the archive uses the latter|pg||

nt|ahollan1: last board  of the set|pg||
nt|ahollan1: segment 3 of 8 starts in 50 minutes|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C!|mb|p|nt|serhat:  Specs asking how about minors last hand. -A7 @S and void @H = high possibility of one of the minor most of the time. So I believe it was all to do with a of @s and H void to bid 7s|pg||
mb|1H!|an|!s|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@C = 2+@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H = 4+@S|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|fuquay:  Here NS at the other table found the 6@D.  It looks like a good but hard to find contract.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N = 17-19, can have 3@S|pg||
nt|fuquay:  Makes if @D are 3-2 and @S no worse than 4-2|pg||
nt|stc:  not sure that they bid 6@D|pg||

pc|c3|nt|stc:  in OR the french were in recovery mode after 3NTX|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S forced // 3N = 5@S, COG  [choice of game]|pg||
nt|stc:  and indeed they recovered|pg||
nt|fabsayc:  1d-1s-2h reverse might have got them to slam in standard|pg||
nt|vugraphc1: toilet break|pg||
nt|serhat:  nice 6@D other room|pg||
nt|ahollan1: very nice auction from bessis-volcker|pg||
nt|fuquay:  There are other chances as well, e.g., 4-1 @D and 3-3 @S or a favorable @HA lead or other things|pg||
