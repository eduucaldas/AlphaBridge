mb|p|nt|nick jacob:  Congratulations to Whibley-Brown, Cornell-Bach, and Ware-Tislevoll. They followed up becoming the first New Zealand team to qualify for the Bermuda Bowl knockouts to win their very first knockout match. Shades of Iceland, 1991... but we'll see|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  tomorrow :)|pg||
mb|1N|mb|2H|nt|nick jacob:  They play France in the semifinal. France dominated New Zealand in the round robin match this time. But they will be nervous. After all, New Zealand pulled off an underdog victory against France in the Ro16 in Wroclaw last year. Expect fireworks|pg||
mb|d|nt|nick jacob:  Commiserations to the Dutch squad. They have a mix of youth and experience and I expect this team to keep getting better. van Lankveld-van den Bos, de Wijs-Muller, and Nab-Drijver played with great skill and spirit.|pg||
nt|bobholl: congratulations pity cliff richard not there to sing it to the kiwis|pg||
