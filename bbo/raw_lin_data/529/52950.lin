mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit:  Scary hand for East. He knows if he bids he will be raised to game.|pg||

mb|3S|mb|p|nt|kit:  In addition, opponents will make 3D if they get the clubs right (which they will)|pg||

nt|ahollan1: should have typed faster|pg||

nt|fuquay:  But as a spectator pointed out, he is probably going down if 3 heart losers|pg||
