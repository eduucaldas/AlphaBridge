nt|fuquay:  Here 6@D makes with 2-2 @D, or 3-1 @D and 3-3 @C |pg||
nt|ahollan2: i.e.  if 2 suiter you started by showing the shorter suit|pg||
nt|ahollan2: other table playing  16|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|fuquay:  or stiff @D Q of course|pg||
nt|patricck:  Yes, 6@D is quite good contract|pg||
nt|bobholl: a lot better than 3NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|nt|patricck:  2-2@D or 3-1 with singleton Queen happens 52.5% of the time|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|vugraphc1: In 52.5% of the time, it works every time :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|6D|mb|p|nt|patricck:  Some of the time when the diamonds are  -! not singleton queen you get to make with a 3-3 club break anyway|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|c2|nt|patricck:  I'm going to say 6@D will make about 65% of the time|pg||
nt|bobholl: and on a @S lead it is even made with @C 42|pg||
nt|ahollan2: exactly 50%|pg||
nt|fuquay:  @S lead takes out an entry|pg||
nt|ahollan2: it makes or it doesn't|pg||
nt|bobholl: yes sry|pg||
nt|rogerclee:  the additional chance is actually a heart lead with the person with 3@d also having 4@C|pg||

nt|stc:  ooops|pg||
nt|ahollan2: after short @C lead  not surprised he played for @D3-1|pg||
nt|serhat:  will he lead singleton with Qxx?|pg||
nt|stc:  dec read correctly the lead as a single and decided to take the finesse|pg||
nt|ahollan2: but  would he lead stiff with @DQxx|pg||
nt|ahollan2: garozzo said  if you don't lead singleton you don't have one  [or it is singleton trump]|pg||
nt|stc:  a very expensive decision, minus 10 instead of plus ten|pg||
nt|ahollan2: @CJ seems best|pg||
nt|ahollan2: to break up possible squeeze|pg||
nt|patricck:  South prob has an Honor sequence in their major. Wouldn't you be more likely to lead that than a singleton when holding @D Qxx|pg||
nt|ahollan2: i think @S or @CJ    but biased by seeing all the cards|pg||
nt|stc:  only a small @c may give the slam, be will NOT play a small @c|pg||
nt|ahollan2: maybe even @H5  works   but @H10 is BAD for defense|pg||
nt|Authau: and 10@h which drives to a squeeze|pg||
nt|ahollan2: i got that out just before  slew o private chat|pg||
nt|Authau: (double)|pg||
nt|stc:  10@h also |pg||
nt|patricck:  with 19 boards t go in the match this looks like a pivotal moment|pg||
nt|stc:  kibs are right double sqz after 10 @h|pg||
nt|ahollan2: to ALL who are sending messages  --  no double squeeze if moss retains @H10|pg||
nt|rogerclee:  @HT will result in a strange squeeze. declarer comes down to ax kqxx in the blacks with 2 trumps in the dummy. on the first trump, north must pitch a spade, so east pitches a club and south gets squeezed on 3 rounds of clubs.|pg||
