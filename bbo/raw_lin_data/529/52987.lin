nt|nick jacob:  transfers over 1@C can be excellent, but you need to have firm agreements|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  for me, 1@C-1@S; 1NT-3@C is GF with 5+@D and 4+@C, a perfect description|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|nick jacob:  now they are in the same boat as the Bulgarian N/S pair|pg||

mb|p|mb|4C|nt|nick jacob:  I know that Cornell loves to play 4@C as RKCB, but here with no suit agreed it seems likely to be natural|pg||
