nt|nick jacob:  we call these sorts of slams 50%|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  they make or they don't|pg||

nt|bobholl: 6@C is best slam i guess|pg||
nt|sommer:  MÃ¼ller played 5@C very nice... this isn't quite as well played|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  he was trying to avoid the heart finesse, but I think that was an illusion|pg||
nt|bobholl: and there isn't a push ??!!|pg||

mb|4C|mb|p|nt|sommer:  4N to play|pg||
mb|4D!|mb|p|nt|patricck:  At least there IS one more set. If this was a s stanza match of 80 boards NZ would be quite frustrated with the last 3 boards being such solid EW games, no real chance of a swing|pg||
nt|patricck:  Expected this to die in 3NT, where are they going now?|pg||
nt|bobholl: 6@C i fear|pg||
nt|sommer:  I'm not sure about 2@C/2@D from E..I play them like double "new minor" .. but for sure 2@D was GF|pg||
mb|4H!|mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|nt|sommer:  ..maybe 1@S promises an unball hand!|pg||
nt|sommer:  ..6NT is terrible...but making!!!..so is 6@D|pg||
nt|sommer:  6@H on Moysian is a winner too|pg||
nt|patricck:  6NT does make on a 3-3 diamond break and the heart finesse. That is 18% and there are only two entries to the West hand, so you need the K@H to be doubleton or tripleton, so it is more like 10%|pg||
nt|bobholl: i hear meckwell bid and made 6@H|pg||
nt|sommer:  nice|pg||
nt|patricck:  nice result...... but was he happy when he saw dummy?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|patricck:  whichever of them was declarer that is|pg||

nt|bobholl: sry don't know al hollander told me|pg||
nt|bobholl: that migth make on nose|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sommer:  may be easy enough ...|pg||
nt|patricck:  6@H is certainly better than 6NT |pg||
nt|ferlema: 5th World Youth Open Championships running scores & all info here  http://youth.worldbridge.org/wyoc-lyon-2017-august-20th/|pg||
nt|sommer:  why is 6@H better than 6NT?|pg||
nt|bobholl: can trump 1@C|pg||
nt|sommer:  I cant see that|pg||
nt|patricck:  can ruff a club in the short hand|pg||
nt|sommer:  cab he?|pg||
nt|sommer:  ..can..|pg||
nt|patricck:  at least gives other options in the play|pg||
nt|bobholl: 8@H higher than 6 :)|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|dJ|pc|d3|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h9|nt|patricck:  yes, I see on the actual hand that the 5-1 club break means that can happen, but just looking at the EW hands alone there are more options to the play in 6@H than 6NT|pg||
