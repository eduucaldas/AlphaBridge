nt|nick jacob:  his holdings in the minors are very poor in context|pg||

nt|nick jacob:  this is the sort of board that doesn't go your way when you are down 36 IMPs on the set|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  Rombaut will at least bid slam. I guess he will bid 5@H en route.|pg||

nt|nick jacob:  what would you expect from 3@H then 4NT?|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  compared to a direct 4NT|pg||
nt|lmilne:  direct 4NT, perhaps just extreme shape|pg||
pc|sT|nt|nick jacob:  so this should be a strong 55, right?|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  I don't even think this qualifies|pg||

pc|hK|pc|h7|pc|h2|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  also, he didn't have a hand that was particularly excited about 3NT opposite both minors. of course, he probably felt he had to bid it if his partner held long clubs in a traditional stopper ask.|pg||
nt|poohbear: Perhaps the one chance to beat this is a low @c and hope partner has the 10 . Looks like 10 tricks on a @s play|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hQ|pc|h8|pc|h3|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  could he possibly beat the contract with this play, too?|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  only one entry to the East hand makes communications very awkward. however, either defender will have to give him access at some point, so perhaps it is better to play a club now|pg||
nt|poohbear: yes if partner has the @s J but with both @cs on declarer might be forced to make it|pg||
