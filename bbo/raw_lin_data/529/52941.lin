mb|3D|mb|3H|nt|MAXLAM:  Nous sommes bien partis. Mais si vous regardez lâÃ©volution des matchs des 1/4 de finale vous constaterez que la fable du livre et de la tortue est toujours dâactualitÃ©.|pg||

nt|nick jacob:  it could be right to play either major. basically, you want to play the one that breaks.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|vugraphc1: Sex change time |pg||
nt|nick jacob:  had spades broken, but not hearts, you could play on loser-on-loser lines in diamonds and make with hearts 4-1 offside|pg||
nt|MAXLAM:  liÃ¨vre*|pg||
nt|lmilne:  The French found an interesting treatment here - 2@S showing hearts so that the overcaller would be on lead. |pg||
nt|lmilne:  Another situation where that works well is after Stayman is doubled. Having the doubler on lead can be very effective|pg||
nt|vugraphc1: I prefer showing a stop, and rightsiding a contract that way|pg||

pc|dJ|pg||
pc|c6|nt|nick jacob:  yes, there are a couple of ways to do it. sometimes you have a positional stopper that you want to right-side, other times you are anti-positional and want responder to play it|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  having some flexibility is good|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  Brown gives suit preference on the diamond.|pg||
nt|lmilne:  For the non-French speakers "NS are very aggressive, which we have seen can have consequences"|pg||

mb|1S|nt|lmilne:  Some might have doubled with Brown's hand, but there is less reason to opposite a passed hand. More danger, game less likely|pg||
nt|besbes:  L'Ã©quipe de Nouvelle-ZÃ©lande est une Ã©quipe trÃ¨s dangereuse et il y a fort Ã  parier qu'ils vont tenter des tas de choses, peut-Ãªtre pas immÃ©diatement.|pg||

nt|besbes:  Ce 2SA est surement le soutien le plus fort, l'Ã©quivalent dans notre systÃ¨me d'un cue-bid Ã  saut.|pg||
nt|vugraphc1: Bessis enquiring about different ways to show support by Brown, such as 3@D and 3@H|pg||
nt|MAXLAM:  Pas de Majeures Ne pas rÃ©veiller le loup qui dormirait ou anticiper l'ouverture en 4Ã¨me pour compÃ©titer|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  It can be quite complex to learn all these auctions. Although they usually play 2NT as a raise, with two two-level cuebids, and two three-level cuebids available, there is no need for it to be a raise.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|cA|nt|lmilne:  There are a few situations where 2NT needs to be natural, and I think this is one of them|pg||

nt|vugraphc1: Volcker looking confused|pg||
nt|lmilne:  All will become clear shortly|pg||
pc|s5|nt|lmilne:  Brown might have become aware at the second point that something fishy was going on. This is not a normal auction.|pg||
nt|lmilne:  Luckily NS have not missed a vulnerable game this time|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  it's pretty typical with 5@S and 3@H and not enough to raise to 2@H|pg||

nt|MAXLAM:  I agree one may think there's someting fishy|pg||
nt|lmilne:  I will simply say that it is rare for East not to have raised to 2@H the first time with anything resembling an OK hand |pg||
nt|lmilne:  That seems controversial though so we can move on|pg||
