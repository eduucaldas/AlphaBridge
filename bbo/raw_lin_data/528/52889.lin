nt|nick jacob:  I think Whibley will bid 4@H over 3@S|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  they open very light at nil, and he can picture the spade shortness opposite|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  of course, E/W could have only an 8 card fit, which is his concern|pg||

nt|lmilne:  Last two boards of the day|pg||
mb|1D|an|heart|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lmilne:  Brown trying an offbeat 1@C. I think they can open 1@D with this hand but he might not want to with a poor suit and poor hand|pg||
mb|d|nt|nick jacob:  he's trying to maneuvre himself into the hot seat|pg||
mb|r|nt|nick jacob:  get those sexy declarer skills going|pg||
nt|lmilne:  Pass by Brown suggesting no three card fit, so I expected Whibley to pass out 1@S. But he has chosen to compete|pg||

nt|nick jacob:  this has actually worked out beautifully for the Kiwis|pg||
nt|lmilne:  This is not a bad contract.|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  after the last few boards, the Dutch have decided to drop the hammer|pg||
pc|sT|nt|nick jacob:  the Kiwis use the old trick of derping around in the auction before finally landing in a good spot|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  this is looking pretty juicy|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  Whibley does have to navigate some uncharted waters|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  but he will find that there aren't any shoals to scupper his ship|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|lmilne:  van den Bos had the points but I'm not too sure about this penalty double of 2@H. Seems like it was based on momentum, feel... but not necessarily logic|pg||
pc|d7|nt|lmilne:  the last double worked a treat and who knows, maybe this one will too?|pg||
