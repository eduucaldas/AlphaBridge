mb|1C!|mb|p|mb|2C!|mb|d|mb|p|nt|lmilne:  Drijver's choice to run the @HQ after taking his discard was not unreasonable and would have often worked. At the other table, declarer got a spade lead, and led a heart towards the Q at trick 2|pg||
mb|3S|nt|lmilne:  2@C = inverted minors, strong raise. Not sure if forcing to game or simply invitational or better|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|lmilne:  Double will be takeout style, with the emphasis on finding a spade stopper for 3NT|pg||
nt|lmilne:  Cornell doesn't have a good bid. 4@C is somewhat safe, 4@H might be OK (but partner probably doesn't have hearts with you) and Pass is worth consideringa s well|pg||
nt|lmilne:  The other table got to 3NT for a quick two down|pg||
nt|lmilne:  I was surprised by their auction: 1NT (9-12) P 3NT from West. |pg||
nt|fabsayc:  takeout or not, its a scary bid with that shape|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|lmilne:  Perhaps West at the other table didn't think his hand was good enough to make 5 minor, and hoped for the best in 3NT. |pg||
nt|lmilne:  Cornell choosing the safe option.|pg||
nt|lmilne:  NS look like a fair shot to make 10 tricks in spades, so passing was not going to work well|pg||
nt|dburn:  surprised at no redouble to show three-card club support - thought that was the modern game|pg||
nt|lmilne:  Hadn't heard that one. I think for most pairs down under redouble would show strength and look for blood.|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lmilne:  Ashley Bach not heeding the weak sound of pass, then 4@C, but the final contract is the same|pg||
nt|dburn:  new favourite at Plumpton|pg||
nt|lmilne:  This is a much better contract than 3NT. The NS bidding preempted the auction but prevented a silly contract.|pg||
nt|dburn:  mind you, he hasn't made this yet - the minor-suit splits are a bit awkward|pg||

pc|s5|pc|s9|pc|sT|nt|nick jacob:  getting tapped twice will mean that he can't test for @HJxx offside|pg||

nt|nick jacob:  but he will be able to pick up @HJx offside via the show-up squeeze|pg||

nt|nick jacob:  not after he loses to the @HA, they play another spade|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|lmilne:  I'll make a bold prediction that this one will go down to the wire. Both teams are very keen to make it to the next stage: NZL for their first ever BB semi, and Netherlands in an effort to re-claim the Bowl that they won in 2011.|pg||
mb|d|nt|lmilne:  Time penalty|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  Slow play in the first set|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  This is an excellent position for Cornell|pg||
nt|lmilne:  Official, the penalty was 20 IMPs, divided 13 against NZL and 7 against Netherlands, for a net 6 IMP swing to the Dutch.|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  anyone up for XX? If he does, he may regret it on a spade lead|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  thanks Liam|pg||
mb|r|nt|lmilne:  OK, action stations|pg||
mb|p|nt|nick jacob:  I'm told that X suggests a spade lead in the Dutch methods|pg||

nt|nick jacob:  I do not believe so|pg||
nt|ellapatto:  no such thing as doubt in nz|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  I for sure would be going for at least 400 on this hand|pg||
nt|lmilne:  Bach has doubt, unless he is just enjoying the moment|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  Bach doesn't really have anything too out of the ordinary|pg||
nt|lmilne:  If this double from Drijver works, luck will be with him. Catching partner with two spades including the 9 is pretty nice|pg||
nt|lmilne:  Bach possibly wondering if redouble could be for rescue. It could be a match-decider if it is and he passes.|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|nick jacob:  I need more partners like Ashley... save me from myself|pg||
nt|lmilne:  Back to placidity|pg||
nt|lmilne:  5@D is a better contract, it looks|pg||
nt|lmilne:  Will Cornell try for slam? Bit optimistic I think.|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  slam? I think he'll pass|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lmilne:  He didnt come to the Bermuda Bowl to pass|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  hahaha it is a bit much to redouble and pass it in partscore|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  now we have a director call|pg||
nt|lmilne:  "Partner doubled vul at the three-level, I have 14 points, let's play 4 minor" said no one ever|pg||
nt|ferlema: 43rd World Bridge Teams Championships running scores & all info here: http://youth.worldbridge.org/wbtc-lyon-2017-august-20th/|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  This is the second time Drijver has called the director in the middle of an auction, and left the table to talk to the director|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  in this match|pg||
nt|lmilne:  I'm sure everything is slow. But it hasn't been fast all match. |pg||
nt|lmilne:  It's not at all clear what Bach was considering when he was thinking. Whether to pass, what redouble means, whether to bid 5D instead of 4D (on a different hand of course)...|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  The director call is almost certainly about the tempo of the XX and the slow pull|pg||
mb|p|nt|lmilne:  Of course, but who pulls 3NTXX quickly in this auction?|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  I think this is really frivolous, but it is a BB quarterfinal so better to be safe than sorry I guess|pg||
nt|lmilne:  That's one way to think about it - I would rather just play cards and not distract myself|pg||
nt|lmilne:  But I am sure Bob has a good reason to call|pg||
nt|fabsayc:  what makes you guys think the double of 3nt called for a spade lead|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  there's a lot of emotion at the table. tight match, lots of pressure. Bob will be taking his time to relax and work out the best lead.|pg||
nt|fabsayc:  thank you kibitzers, apparently its on their convention card|pg||

nt|nick jacob:  Yes it's very close. I think doubling over spades is always a bit tougher on these hands. You lose the safety blanket of the one level, and you can't outbid your opponents when partner has shape|pg||

nt|nick jacob:  it's a bit of a bluffing situation. He can see the @H97x in dummy, so he knows that they can't take two hearts by traditional means. requires some subterfuge.|pg||

pc|s3|pc|s9|nt|lmilne:  Indeed, Nick...|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  would much rather go a couple down here and make 1@HX. as it stands, they'll have to make this to limit the damage|pg||
nt|lmilne:  Normally playing the same strain in both rooms is only good if you have successfully psyched|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  sometimes 1NT can be good at Nil, too. but yes it's usually bad|pg||
nt|lmilne:  So a great score comes in for the Dutch in the other room. East did well to pass his partner's takeout double of 1@D, and then capitalised for a nice penalty|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|nt|nick jacob:  I think the swing owes more to West than East for making a takeout double with 54 in the majors rather than a 1@S overcall|pg||

nt|nick jacob:  a rare loser for Suction... though I'm sure Ash will find a way to put a positive spin on it :)|pg||

nt|lmilne:  Perhaps not? 8 tricks still looks unlikely actually|pg||
pc|c6|pc|sT|pc|h2|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|lmilne:  South accurately pitches a spade to prevent a spade ruff|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|nt|lmilne:  I suspect that Cornell would have had a chance if he had ruffed the diamond rather than running it to hand. He could have made a spade ruff then|pg||
