mb|p|mb|p|nt|bjacobs:  Well in the context of the auction, it must be suggesting a club contract as an alternative to hearts|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  I think it would have been perfect with say 2-5-2-4 shape|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  I'm assuming a support redouble and all that jazz|pg||
nt|lmilne:  Yes, some sort of takeout, despite the major suit fit known|pg||
nt|lmilne:  Nine-card fits are pretty good if you can find them|pg||
nt|lmilne:  Schwerdt can see that the 5-3 heart fit will have issues with such poor trumps|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lmilne:  Germany a chance to go plus in both rooms for a final swing in|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hJ|pc|h3|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  he may have to squash the @CJ to make this|pg||
nt|lmilne:  Yes agree|pg||
nt|lmilne:  @CKx with West not enough, so he may go for it|pg||
nt|lmilne:  It's that or bare King with East|pg||
nt|lmilne:  (after a heart is ruffed)|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  Yes, @CJxxx with West, say 4144 shape.  all possible|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h5|pc|c4|pc|h8|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  which of the two is more likely?  Is there a way to work it out?|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sQ|pc|s2|pc|s7|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d3|pc|d8|nt|bjacobs:  They both play trivially, if you guess the right one|pg||
nt|lmilne:  Declarer won't want for West to have short clubs after he shows up with short hearts|pg||
nt|lmilne:  want to play for*|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d2|pc|d5|nt|bjacobs:  so it's either 4162 or 4144, each with the @CJ|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  time to decide|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cJ|pc|c2|pc|c6|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d4|pc|hQ|pc|c7|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  Have to ay, 4144 seemed more "obvious" |pg||
nt|lmilne:  True. and East could have been 4441 as well|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  it was all consistent.  An interesting little play problem on an interesting little deal (bidding and play)|pg||
