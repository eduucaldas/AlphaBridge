nt|lmilne:  even if the defence tap the dummy in clubs, Bach can ruff back to hand in hearts (now that he has cleared the path), draw trump, and run diamonds|pg||
nt|lmilne:  So the best play from Nab will be a heart or a diamond, rather than a club which will lead to 11 easy tricks.|pg||

mb|p|nt|lmilne:  South is hoping to run the diamonds with a few useful fillers. |pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|lmilne:  A heart lead, or a club lead and a heart switch, will kill this|pg||
mb|p|nt|lmilne:  Will North run? He doesn't know much about his partner's hand|pg||
nt|lmilne:  Or will Bach bid to 4@S first?|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  Both West and North have very difficult decisions|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  Bach having all this extra spade support and no defense may well take insurance. Except he will be thinking that his spade lead will have good chances of beating the contract.|pg||
nt|lmilne:  North can see that on a spade lead, there will be two stoppers and 3NT should come home|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  Maybe Drijver will redouble for doubt?|pg||
nt|lmilne:  So I think he will pass this out if he gets the chance|pg||

nt|lmilne:  Big heart telling North it is safe to underlead the @DAK if he has it to go for another ruff|pg||

nt|lmilne:  North will do well if he cashes the @S Ace here. If he doesn't, 4@S may make|pg||
nt|lmilne:  South will be tempted to rise with the @SK on the first round, having shown it in the auction|pg||

mb|3S|mb|d|nt|lmilne:  16 IMP swing on that defence. Onto the next board.|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  I actually think Nab shouldn't have given such strong preference for diamonds. It meant that he could not tell whether or not his partner wanted to switch to clubs, say.|pg||
mb|4S|mb|5C|mb|p|nt|lmilne:  At the other table, West was able to overcall 4@C, showing clubs and hearts|pg||
nt|lmilne:  Bach either didn't have that available, or wasn't sure his hand was strong enough - fair enough|pg||
mb|p|nt|lmilne:  5@C can be made without guessing diamonds if East sets up West's heart suit, so this looks like it will make. North has a good dive in 5@S|pg||
nt|ferlema: 5th World Youth Open Championships running scores & all info here  http://youth.worldbridge.org/wyoc-lyon-2017-august-19th/|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D!|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|nick jacob:  Cornell and Bach will have some work to do to push this board.|pg||
mb|p|nt|nick jacob:  Against 4@H, the defense needs to play three rounds of clubs to promote an extra trump trick.|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|lmilne:  4@H looks the normal contract here for EW. 1@D = 4+ hearts|pg||
nt|fabsayc:  actually 3NT looks as promising as 4@H|pg||
nt|lmilne:  Yes, and West may offer it now. But whether Cornell will pass is a different matter|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  It will be hard for Cornell to stick 3NT with his singleton, but the Ace does make it tempting|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|nick jacob:  As spec points out, the difference in West playing the contract will mean that North will have to find the club lead.|pg||

pc|d5|nt|nick jacob:  I don't think Cornell would ever pass 3NT, regardless of the speed of the 3NT. Partner's range is 11-14 and it doesn't look like the sort of hand where you are going to be able to set up both hearts and clubs in time.|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  it wouldn't be unreasonable for Ash Bach to play a low heart now. That would give Bob Drijver a chance to score the @HJ via promotion.|pg||
nt|fabsayc:  i argue the over way, Nick, I try to avoid weak 4-4 fits with limited values|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  fair enough, Martin. 9 is often easier than 10|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hJ|nt|lmilne:  OK, cheers then sighs for the Dutch|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  East-West don't have any knowledge of a double fit either. For them, the 1@C-then-2@H raise could still have a singleton club|pg||
nt|lmilne:  If Bob had hopped up and played on clubs, 4@H would be doomed, but declarer can play the Queen and should survive from there|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  which argues for considering 3NT|pg||

nt|nick jacob:  and it will be a brutal position for Bach to read|pg||
nt|lmilne:  I don't think the defence can do it now. North can make the @HK but then south's @H10 is finessable. But still needs doing|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  if the Dutch do play three rounds of clubs, scoring the @HK... won't declarer think that North holds @HKJ10 for the duck on the first round?|pg||

nt|lmilne:  Now Cornell will need to play a spade, or a diamond then a spade. He is most likely thinking about blowing partner's trump trick...|pg||
nt|lmilne:  Whether a low one or the Ace is best|pg||
nt|lmilne:  Partner won't usually turn up with many trump tricks on this auction. But Cornell is trying to find a route to four tricks|pg||
nt|lmilne:  West played the @C2 at trick one, consistent with suit pref for diamonds|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  I think once Cornell knows of the strong diamond preference, he can play spades himself|pg||
nt|fabsayc:  what bothers me is why heart 7|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  Drijver probably wouldn't have a 4@S bid without the @DA and without solid trumps (missing the Ace)|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  that's just reverse count Martin|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  upside down for the North Americans :)|pg||

pc|h4|nt|lmilne:  Dirjver will be thinking along the lines of: 'If I play clubs now, and they set up the diamonds, they might take 1 club, 4 diamonds and 2 spades before I can get a heart.' I think he will try to get one heart and go for clubs|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lmilne:  Low heart, didn't predict that.|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hA|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  not that the 9 promises 3+ -- just that East would not lead from a doubleton spade when he knows his opponents have 7+ spades and it could blow the suit|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|lmilne:  In the common modern style, raising to 2@H will allow partner to bid 4@H aggressively, so 1NT is the middle road - making a noise, but not showing too much|pg||
nt|lmilne:  When you subsequently "show preference" to hearts, partner thinks you only have two, which slows down the auction|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  at these colours, the big advantage is shutting E/W out of their game|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|lmilne:  Much better to bid 1NT and go for the shut-out than pass and tell the world you're penniless|pg||

nt|lmilne:  Less risky when partner has points of course|pg||

nt|fabsayc:  cornell does not believe in the bluff 1nt, which actually makes more sense to me on this hand|pg||

nt|fabsayc:  same vuls as when Nab did it|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  but it does mean he will be under pressure to act|pg||
nt|lmilne:  Yes, a 1NT response would have meant less incentive to bid later|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  there is an appreciable difference to doing it with a heart fit compared to having a spade fit, I think|pg||
mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|nick jacob:  but yes, over North's raise, Cornell will need to show his spade support at some stage|pg||

nt|nick jacob:  I think there is a 0% chance of seeing the @SQ switch|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  impossible for Bach to play Cornell for this hand|pg||
nt|lmilne:  @S 10 covered by jack, king, ace. Run all the hearts. West comes down to KJ of clubs and a high spade. South produces the killing @S8|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  given no raise at any point|pg||
pc|sT|nt|lmilne:  West would probably throw all their spades and hope, and the @S8 would take the tenth trick. If that happens, call me Nostrodamus|pg||
nt|fabsayc:  to avoid the squeeze, needed to shift trick 2|pg||
nt|lmilne:  South has a lot of information. If he finds this play I think we can all be rightfully impressed |pg||
nt|fabsayc:  seeing the value of spade 8 is the hard part|pg||
nt|lmilne:  Specs are telling me the strip squeeze has been found in other matches. That's why we watch this stuff folks|pg||

nt|nick jacob:  he was helped by a 2@S raise from partner|pg||

nt|KiwiBridge:  could have been worse :)|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  we're coming up to the last board. another 81 to go, and if they're anything like the first 15, it's going to be a tight, grulling match|pg||
nt|bobholl: now lets see wheather the kiwis can bid like the tarzan people did at the other table|pg||
mb|2N|nt|fabsayc:  the good news for spectators is the wait for next set is shorter|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  It's a real pleasure getting to see the Kiwis playing another long knockout match on the world stage. We had our first two knockouts ever in Wroclaw, so we're enjoying a good run of form|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: whether sry made same mistake yesterday :):(|pg||

mb|p|mb|6S|nt|bobholl: simon checking the bidding|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|patricck:  but you never know at this game. I once defended 3NT that I thought was a sure pickup because they had missed a slam and team-mates passed it in. Sad, but true|pg||
pc|h2|nt|patricck:  they were playing forcing pass and the tray wasn't pushed far enough under the screen and the person in 3rd seat also made a forcing pass thinking he was in 2nd position|pg||
