mb|3D|nt|lmilne:  France qualified first again here. They did not choose New Zealand.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|nick jacob:  I believe the Kiwis have a 6 IMP penalty for slow play in the first set.|pg||
mb|p|pc|hK|nt|nick jacob:  tough but fair I think. Early on the Dutch were also a little slow, but the vast majority was Cornell-Bach|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hT|nt|lmilne:  Cornell-Bach were extremely slow in the first and finished well after session time, so unless the director in charge decided that Netherlands were equally to blame, there had to be a penalty|pg||

nt|nick jacob:  I was going for the sleight of hand approach|pg||

mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4C!|nt|nick jacob:  correction -- 10-13 1NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|nick jacob:  2NT showed 4@S, 3@S sets spades|pg||
nt|lmilne:  I like this. Normally 1NT is the strong hand. When you can have 9 or 10 points, not so muchl.|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  I would hazard a guess that they're cuebidding now, but I could be wrong. The Dutch pairs are on the cutting edge of bidding theory.|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|lmilne:  I play a different structure over 1NT 9-12 involving 2@D forcing 2@H, then most bids show hearts, 2@S shows spades forcing. Also fairly effective|pg||
mb|4H!|mb|p|nt|KiwiBridge:  If you've studied bridge history, you will have heard of the Blue Team and the amazing Benito Garozzo, was great to see him on video last night although losing to the Kiwis, he is still amazing at 90 years|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  Van den Bos could have asked for shape over 2NT, but decided to set spades instead. He already knew that Van Lankveld could not hold 4@H, so there is guaranteed ruffing value|pg||
nt|lmilne:  So, do we like 6@S? Not terrible, but not making this time double dummy. A heart lead would not be unreasonable|pg||
nt|lmilne:  NZL in 5@S at other table|pg||
nt|lmilne:  Whibley will have a lot of information by the time he gets to the point where he needs to lead a card|pg||
mb|4N!|mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|nt|nick jacob:  looks percentage to stay out of slam. still not cold if the heart finesse works, and if it fails you're in poor shape|pg||
mb|5D!|mb|p|nt|lmilne:  Trumps an issue as well|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|nt|lmilne:  They are on their way. All the keycards. |pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lmilne:  I don't think they can stop now, but perhaps van den Bos knows more than I|pg||
mb|p|nt|nick jacob:  Had 4@H been a cuebid, Van den Bos would be very confident about slam. I believe it is just a last train bid confirming interest in slam|pg||
nt|lmilne:  Right-siding the spades may be worth a lot of IMPs now.....|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  thorny holdings in every off-suit suggests a passive approach; possibly the @CJ?|pg||
nt|lmilne:  The general advice is to lead aggressive against slam. Hopefully for the Kiwis all those little bits and bobs will steer Whibley away from the heart.|pg||
nt|lmilne:  I can imagine myself going for it though|pg||
nt|lmilne:  He won't lead a spade - he knows his partner has the queen|pg||
nt|lmilne:  But he also knows partner has no Aces, I think - the opps have gone to slam missing the trump queen|pg||

nt|lmilne:  16, my apologies - 17 for a major suit or 7NT vs 100|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|lmilne:  Spec makes a good comment - if the spades were solid, grand would be good|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|nick jacob:  yes agreed. grand has amazing chances, especially from North|pg||
nt|lmilne:  But with the 3-2 break needed, this is a stretch. Which is what NZL likes given that it makes|pg||
mb|2H!|mb|p|mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|nick jacob:  we saw a diamond lead in the closed room, which people have been known to finesse... not today, though|pg||
mb|3C!|mb|p|mb|3N!|mb|p|mb|4C!|mb|p|nt|nick jacob:  had clubs not split 3-3, he would have had a double squeeze if West held four clubs|pg||
mb|4H!|mb|p|nt|nick jacob:  East would be squeezed between hearts and the @DK; West between hearts and the fourth club|pg||
mb|4N!|mb|p|mb|5H!|nt|nick jacob:  had East held four clubs, he could have chosen to play for the double squeeze (with West leading a sneaky diamond away from the King) or, more likely, the heart finesse|pg||
nt|nick jacob:  so once the spades come in, grand is really excellent. but a heart lead changes the play (no double squeeze) and spades coming in is only 68%|pg||
mb|p|mb|5N|mb|p|nt|nick jacob:  of course, you could run a double squeeze with CLUBS as the pivot suit. only one opponent can guard the clubs, but as long as the red menaces are split, with West holding the @HQ, you'll be okay|pg||
mb|6S|nt|nick jacob:  I think the heart double squeeze is a little better|pg||

nt|nick jacob:  and the already seen @DK|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|nick jacob:  It is pretty old school for North to be unable to find a bid over 1@H, but that's what happened at the other table|pg||

nt|nick jacob:  so this is a pretty strange approach from West|pg||
