nt|Lady007:  I dont think there was any hurry to play a second diamond|pg||
nt|Lady007:  and if he doesnt play one back, Nystrom knows he shouldnt cover the diamond|pg||
nt|Lady007:  even if Nystrom has the ace, there is no rush. Unless it was a clever low diamond from Ax|pg||
nt|Lady007:  but even then 4@H will always go down|pg||
nt|Lady007:  Nystrom certainly thinking it over well. The problem with covering is also that he has no entry|pg||
nt|Lady007:  even if declarer has Kx Kxxxx Axx xxx he still has a chance to get the spades right|pg||
nt|Lady007:  or Ax Kxxxx Axx xxx|pg||
nt|Lady007:  he will almost surely get the spades right with that second hand, so covering the diamond wont even help|pg||
nt|Lady007:  At the other table the defense started the same I think, but Pepsi didnt cover in this position|pg||
nt|Lady007:  East could have doubled with 4126. But surely overcalling 2@C on KQJxxx is a good alternative as well|pg||
nt|Lady007:  with 4162 they would double for sure as they play equal level conversion (where converting a club bid to diamonds doesnt show extras)|pg||

nt|ahollan1: rosenberg lead was @S7  but south had shown 5134 shape|pg||
nt|Lady007:  5@C can always be made double dummy (finesse spades, cash 2 hearts and ruff a heart, and play 2 rounds of clubs to endplay east) but would likely go down on another lead|pg||
