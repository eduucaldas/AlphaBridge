nt|ahollan1: i've never been very good at answering questions like -- you chose the wrong opening bid - what do you do now|pg||
pc|s5|nt|yorkbeach:  fair enough |pg||
pc|s2|pc|sA|nt|yorkbeach:  would you have opened a 14-16 1NT on this North hand|pg||

nt|ahollan1: http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  you have a 10 more than average but a doubleton queen|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think NS actually play 1N=13.5-16   but this choice is more Tom Hanlon than system|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  Thomas might have cashed the @hK before returning the @s|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  the system card on the BGb site says 14-16|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but it doesn't say which mechanism is used to count to 14 :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzhm: See Wales made 4 less tricks in 4@H on board 15|pg||

pc|d9|pc|dQ|pc|d6|pc|d5|pg||
