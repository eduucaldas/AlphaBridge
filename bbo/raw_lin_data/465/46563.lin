nt|lady007:  2@H showing invitational or better with 5+ clubs|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lady007:  These transfers in competition are becoming increasinly popular. You really want the overcaller to be on lead instead of giving his partner an easy lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: extrapolating on 2@H bid   they flip-flop so that 2@C would show 5+@H [but only 8+hcp]|pg||
nt|lady007:  also it gives you more space with major suits (2@D to show hearts), which is regarded more important than space with minor suits |pg||
nt|lady007:  yes I am not sure if 2@C or 2@D shows hearts. Because 1@D only shows 2+ diamonds 2@D might not be natural either|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Marion since it is flip-flop [or switch] rather than transfer, do you think reason is extra bidding space?|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h3|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|lady007:  for instance they can stop in 2@H if west has 8 points and 6 hearts|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ahollan1: i always thought it was similiar to use of 2-under transfers over NT openers and the best way to play unusual vs unusual|pg||
nt|lady007:  so it kind of combines the advantages of 2@H as non forcing, as well as it gives you the chance to bid again with a strong hand, so an advantage of 2@H as 1Rf|pg||
nt|ahollan1: you want partner to have a step bid to differentiate from forced actions|pg||
nt|lady007:  (but this doesnt always work so well, as partner has shown 7+ hcp it makes it sometimes difficult in later auctions, whereas your range is more defined after a non-forcing or 1roundforcing 2@H bid)|pg||
pc|c9|pc|s3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm asked so will explain   after 1M-(2N:minors)  historically 3@C=@H 3@D=@S  easy to remember|pg||
nt|lady007:  yes, if you bid 2@C or 2@D to show hearts, partner can bid 2@H meaning that he doesnt have something special (usually weak NT without good support), while you have no good bid with that hand after a forcing 2@H bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but theoretically better to have 3@C = other major  3@D = fit   that way partner can rebid Major when there is good reason  otherwise make waiting bid when not good M nor fit for ...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: responder|pg||
nt|lady007:  but before everyone starts playing this, remember that no conventions come for free!! firstly, giving more space for one suit makes that you have less space for another. also you have to discuss the follow ups very well|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thinking planning ahead and having agreements -- sounds fishy to me|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sT|nt|lady007:  yes and you have to remember it as well. its dangerous because 2@H here for instance doesnt look like such a strange bid at first, so its easy to forget that it shows clubs|pg||

nt|lady007:  same bidding at the other table|pg||

nt|lady007:  At the other table the EW system makes them open 2@C (20-21 bal or any GF), and NS have just gotten to 4@S before EW have gotten to say anything. West thinking now|pg||
nt|lady007:  yes but he cuebid 4@S as well|pg||

nt|ahollan1: sure   -  just looking at 4@C in isolation  [and coupled with your guess about 4@C-4@D = nat]|pg||
nt|lady007:  a bit unlucky for the Dutch pair at the other table. Slam is very good of course but just happens to go down. As I said earlier, all this high level preempts often works for you (especiall when you are non vulnerable and they are vulnerable) but|pg||
nt|lady007:  sometimes it works against you|pg||
nt|lady007:  as here|pg||
nt|lady007:  I dont mind the NS bidding at the other table at all, instead I would most likely have bid the same. But I am quite sure EW would have gotten to 6@C otherwise|pg||
nt|ahollan1: conclusion:  sometimes preempts work, sometimes preempts don't work, sometimes preempts make no difference|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lady007:  They were a little ahead of EW here since they opened only with 2@C (as opposed to 2NT). The Swedes play a transfer style response there on the 2 level so West could have shown his entire shape and most likely they would have bid the slam)|pg||

nt|lady007:  NS can make 7@D but not 7@H|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|lady007:  I think they will get there if they can bid undisturbed|pg||
mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|lady007:  but east will bid at least 1@S|pg||
nt|lady007:  yes 1@S it is|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good-o   now Marion can explain impact of overcall on Relays|pg||
nt|lady007:  1@H denies a shortness and showes 4+ zz points (A=3, K=2, Q=1)|pg||
mb|2D|nt|lady007:  in 7@D you can discard a club from north on the 5th heart|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4+zz or 5+zz?|pg||
nt|lady007:  sorry 5? zz|pg||
mb|3S|nt|lady007:  2@H showing 5+H. Now west ruins the rest of the relays|pg||
nt|lady007:  not very nice :)|pg||
nt|lady007:  2@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: zz originally meant as place holder - author did not know what to call what many now refer to as AKQ or 321 points|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|lady007:  not sure how they deal with intervention but looks like balanced hands pass and unbalanced hand bids with transfer|pg||
nt|lady007:  (lsimilar to uncontested)|pg||
nt|lady007:  4@S showing a big heart raise|pg||
nt|lady007:  7@D looks impossible to bid now|pg||
nt|lady007:  these hands are much easier on the BBO bidding practise :)|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|lady007:  Upmark doesnt want to use blackwood because the answer wont make him much wiser|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|lady007:  this is an important lesson, dont bid blackwood unless you have a plan over all possible responses|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lady007:  he has a minimum for his 1@C opening (remember he already showed 16+ and 5+ hearts)|pg||
nt|lady007:  but NystrÃ¶m has a great hand with very good controls so he bids the slam|pg||
nt|lady007:  other room also playing 6@H|pg||
nt|lady007:  they got to bid uncontested after the start of 1@H-2Nt but also didnt find the 4-4 diamond fit there|pg||
nt|lady007:  these hands are always very difficult|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|lady007:  to not play your 54 fit major, but instead 44 minor|pg||

nt|lady007:  Here we see once again that the Dutch NS at the other table put maximum pressure on their opponents by jumping in with 3@S at their first opportunity|pg||
nt|ahollan1: last board of the match/day|pg||
nt|ahollan1: great fun having Marion here!|pg||
nt|lady007:  here 2@C is natural, and 2@D asking|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C = 10-14(15) 6+@C|pg||
mb|3S|nt|lady007:  yes thank you as well Al!|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@D RELAY|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S = rude|pg||
nt|lady007:  but Upmark wont give his opponents an easy ride either|pg||
nt|lady007:  3@S looks very expensive buts it often not easy to double these kind of bids|pg||
nt|lady007:  because nobody really has shown a suit yet, doubles are take out and showing a good hand|pg||
nt|lady007:  also the good trump suit protects you, not easy to make a penalty double on Qxxx (if it would have been available)|pg||
