nt|djneill:  2 ways to make - diamond ruffs or setting up @c with @h entry - failing that unlikely squeezes|pg||
nt|djneill:  if North wins @sA and switches to @h seems a @c-@d squeeze on South would work|pg||

nt|MrAce:  awesome 7@S save which may lead to 7 NT |pg||
nt|warrens:  good point|pg||
nt|ahollan1: which EW player can introduce @S??|pg||
mb|5N|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: at one point, i thought NS played DBL = 4+@H 4+@S  but now i think just 4+@H|pg||
nt|warrens:  I think the X showed @H's and South is making a grand slam try asking for 2 of the top 3|pg||
nt|MrAce:  is this good old Josephine?|pg||
nt|MrAce:  I doubt it|pg||
nt|MrAce:  must be something to do with @S void|pg||
nt|warrens:  North is surprised since he also has the @S Ace.  hard to believe the opponents never bid their 10 @S's|pg||
mb|7H|nt|ahollan1: pick-a-slam doesn't make sense to me  so i think excellent time to use Josephine [Culbertson]  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: now known as Grand Slam Force|pg||
nt|warrens:  look at South's hand.  if you're partner made a constructive bid showing @H's, wouldn't you consider bidding 5NT Grand Slam Force?|pg||
nt|warrens:  your*|pg||
nt|ahollan1: show of hands -- does anyone remember Baron Grand Slam convention?|pg||
nt|warrens:  I'd love to see Greco come out with 7@S now|pg||
