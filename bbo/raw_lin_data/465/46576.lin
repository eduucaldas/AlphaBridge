nt|stigw: I predict 1 down, but I have beeen wrong before (repeated times to be honest).|pg||
pc|s4|nt|lady007:  Hi all|pg||
nt|lady007:  Interesting problem for south in the 4th position, with only 10 points and a void in spades he must have been worried that the opponents can make a partscore/game in spades. But then again you have good playing strength as well so thats why |pg||
nt|lady007:  he opened|pg||
pc|s5|nt|stigw: The deal was passed out in the other room, I see, so a swing is sure - but little or big ?|pg||

nt|stigw: Look good for declarer when cl J appears, but is it enough ?|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cJ|nt|lady007:  I think most likely one down. North will make 2 spades, and then they will make a heart and a diamond|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c7|pg||
pc|cT|nt|lady007:  declarer cant draw all the trumps to cash his clubs or NS will run the hearts|pg||
pc|c6|pc|h9|pc|s2|pg||

nt|lady007:  yes but now he will lose 2 diamonds instead, because of the 9 of diamonds in north and 87 in south|pg||
nt|lady007:  as long as they dont touch them|pg||
nt|stigw: 2 diamonds and one trump, I think, but the defence must stay away from diamonds, and North might be endplayed perhaps.|pg||
nt|panja:  @HK seems to be the most likely next play..|pg||
nt|lady007:  He knows he has a spade trick coming and that his partner has the ace of diamonds|pg||
nt|lady007:  he doesnt know of course who has the 10 of diamonds and is hoping it is his partner!|pg||
nt|stigw: South has to keep his 13 th Heart I think (if not it might make).|pg||
nt|panja:  if South held the @DT, even a @D now would defeat...but North does not need to depend on that|pg||
nt|lady007:  yes if south has the @DT its probably 2 down anyhow|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|lady007:  North was worried that he would get endplayed with the last spade if they play too many rounds of hearts|pg||
nt|lady007:  to play a diamond|pg||
nt|lady007:  but I think the endplay didnt work anyway|pg||
nt|lady007:  maybe|pg||
nt|lady007:  but now there are for sure not enough entries|pg||
nt|panja:  Without the double, this hand would have got finished much faster...|pg||
nt|stigw: Sp Ace, heart ruff, and then a diamond to the Jack - how will that end up ?|pg||
nt|panja:  without any A or K in the unbid suits, the dbl looks a bit speculative too me....|pg||

nt|lady007:  well. I like the double. Remember his partner bid twice on a ten count|pg||
nt|lady007:  and still it would have been 500 if the tencount had included the ten of diamonds or the ten of clubs|pg||
pc|sA|pc|c5|nt|panja:  give the @DT to East...and NS would have been risking a game swing for extra 100 with that double|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|lady007:  Brink/Drijver also have a very agressive style if it comes to doubling: they like the 3 or 5 imps extra from 200 or 300 and believe one should double more often|pg||
pc|s9|nt|lady007:  of course every now and then it also makes but as long as it pays off in the long run|pg||

mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5C!|mb|d|nt|lady007:  West has a lot of points in hearts, so the splinter doesnt fit well. But he also has very few losers in the other suits so he will go for the slam|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|stigw: Yes, the heart void want perhaps the most exciting message to hear, but the hearts allow discards of all the club losers, so OK:|pg||

nt|lady007:  now he can even make 7|pg||
nt|panja:  with Clubs taken care of, Declarer will spend some time to wonder how he should play trumps...to cater to a 30 break|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|mb|d|mb|2C|mb|2S|mb|3C|nt|stigw: 3 cl in the other room might perhaps have been made with very good guessing.|pg||
mb|p|nt|stigw: Let's see if Brink can do better that his counterpart !|pg||
nt|panja:  will this make? the 3@C contract?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|panja:  needs @C played from Dummy twice|pg||
nt|panja:  if EW cash their winners and play a third Diamond....|pg||
pc|dK|nt|stigw: A double finesse in clubs is needed, but has he got the entries to do that, I think yes ?|pg||
nt|panja:  S will have to fineese against @HJ..to make...|pg||
nt|panja:  to get an extra entry to Dummy|pg||
nt|lady007:  or ruff the 3rd heart in the dummy|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|pc|d7|pg||
nt|stigw: He can also ruff the 3rd heart, so no need to finesse in H I think.|pg||
nt|panja:  y.....@H 33 break..about 36%..finesse...50%....as against that, you have to weigh something being off and going down two|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sJ|pc|sK|nt|lady007:  Hx onside normally is a much better chance, but after the double, if it is take out (and not 'points') the odds change of course|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dT|nt|panja:  nice defence...|pg||
nt|lady007:  yes but if the hearts are 42 you need to ruff one anyway|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|stigw: East's take-out double suggests, that he has length, i.e. 3 cards, in clubs.|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|lady007:  (or finese the jack)|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s6|pc|s3|pc|s7|pg||

pc|s5|pc|sQ|pc|sA|nt|lady007:  play a lot heart to the ten and double finesse the clubs seems a little bit too much too ask imo|pg||

nt|lady007:  vulnerable undertricks when you play an undoubled partscore arent exactly free either|pg||
nt|stigw: The sp attack wont make any difference in our original analysis.|pg||
nt|panja:  the dbl of 1Nt..is almost like a dbl of 1@H...|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lady007:  he can also play a heart to the king and then queen of clubs-king-ace|pg||

pc|c6|nt|lady007:  the didnt ruff the 3rd heart, but then again east had played the jack because he didnt want his partner to ruff (if partner doesnt have the jack of spades you want declarer to take a spade finesse in your stiff king)|pg||

nt|lady007:  I think EW at this table had a chance. East knows no more clubs are cashing (@C2 should be from 5crd left) and could play the @HJ 'for free'. west can then ruff with the jack of spades 'for free'. But of course this is easier said than done|pg||

nt|lady007:  and maybe not completely for free either. Imagine east has the stiff ace of spades and declarer at some point plays low to the king, then you will get an uppercut for 2 down if you had saved your jack|pg||
nt|vugrapho2: graversen to Drijvej: just relax|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|3D|nt|lady007:  I get a lot of comments from specs. If the king of spades is singleton, you can then play all your trumps and will make for sure on a double squeeze and you dont have to guess the diamonds|pg||
mb|3H|nt|panja:  Skew 1Nt...a good choice with the side K/Q's|pg||
nt|lady007:  also, if west has the king of spaces maybe east has the queen of diamonds and you go down anyway|pg||
nt|lady007:  1NT: 9-12|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|lady007:  3@D preemptive, normally 6crd suit|pg||
nt|panja:  looks like 3@D is sign-off, and 4@C is with support in @D...trying to guide a lead against possible 4@S contract..|pg||
nt|stigw: East should have had a weapon to show a weak hand with 1 of the Majors, now they are left in the dark.|pg||
mb|4D|nt|lady007:  4@S is actually a great contract, but its doomed with both the ace of diamonds and king of spades offside|pg||
nt|panja:  the 4@C lead direction would be vital on slightly different layouts..|pg||
nt|stigw: As 4 Sp should be 1 down, it might not be so damaging not to get that suit mentioned at all.|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lady007:  A little bit inconsistent of west to first bid 3@H and then 4@H|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|stigw: Adventurous bid from Graversen here.|pg||
nt|lady007:  will it pursue Brink to take the save?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lady007:  yes, he is not taking any risks|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|stigw: tHIS SHOULD END UP POSITIVELY FOR THE DANES NOW.|pg||

mb|5D|nt|panja:  funny how @S suit never got a mention|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lady007:  its possible 2 down on 3 rounds of hearts. But I think he will guess the clubs|pg||
nt|lady007:  Ok. 5@D is always 2 down on 3 rounds of hearts|pg||
nt|stigw: They went to 5 sp in the other room I see ! That was at least 1 to many.|pg||
pc|hK|nt|lady007:  as east can overruff dummy on the 3rd round|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h4|pc|h7|pg||

pc|hA|pc|hQ|pc|h5|pc|h9|pg||
nt|stigw: Yes, and starting a "climb-back" !|pg||
nt|panja:  I guess he will cash the @SA first...|pg||
nt|stigw: Sp Ace before Heart I recommend.|pg||
nt|lady007:  Interesting how much one should falsecard as declarer. By playing the 7 he cleared up the card that east played, as the 4 can no longer be from 4578 (but that was unlikely anyway)|pg||
nt|panja:  not putting all eggs in the basket of finding @DK with East|pg||
nt|lady007:  so it could only be a doubleton (highest one from 3 small. important lesson: always signal with the clearest card you can afford. DONT play the 4 from 843 or whatever if you play upside down. play the 8!!)|pg||

nt|lady007:  they might have had a chance for 2 down had east ducked the heart|pg||
nt|stigw: Yes, Sp Ace and a di-shift wont "rock the boat", if South playes low. Best to have ducked the first Heart from East.|pg||
