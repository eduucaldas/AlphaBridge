mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|lady007:  I think the hand is a little weak, at second seat red against white|pg||
mb|2N|mb|3H|nt|lady007:  south coming in with 2NT now to show the minors|pg||
mb|p|nt|tias:  I think that red vs white i would open 2@d multi, but other positions would be 3@s|pg||
nt|lady007:  2@D was multi, usually a weak 2 in a major. 2@H was pass or correct, as would have been 3@H. so to bid her hearts naturally, west had to go through 2@H|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lady007:  Ok. Danish style. :)|pg||
