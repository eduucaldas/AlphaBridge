mb|p|mb|1H|mb|2C|nt|jrssd: but the defense had the right idea|pg||
mb|2D|an|5+ spades|mb|p|nt|jrssd: that has to be 2@S|pg||
nt|jrssd: the hand is JUST strong enough to bid 2@S|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Grabel looking confused.  I assume 2@D shows spades|pg||
nt|jrssd: otherwise, a negative double wd be right|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: many pairs are playing transfer responses after the overcall|pg||
nt|jrssd: really, the 2@D bid stands?|pg||
nt|medwards: Apparently a Transfer|pg||
nt|jrssd: the beauty of using transfers is that East can get in the auction with weak hands as well|pg||
mb|2S|nt|jrssd: just like after a 1N opener|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d5|pc|d2|nt|medwards: Defense can not attack Clubs|pg||
nt|jrssd: interesting, if not playing transfers, East would be 2@S and West wwould raise to ...?|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dK|pg||
nt|jrssd: EW could be "forced" into bidding game|pg||

pc|hA|pg||
nt|jrssd: I think this is a case where transfers hurt them, in an unexpected way. Opinions?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: screen was up and now down again with Weinsteing expanding on whateveer he said earlier|pg||
nt|medwards: Yes it seems that way|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: hurt them because Grabel forgot, I think -- the "expected" reasons :)|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|nt|ritong: tough for east  they may have a way to suggest slam without going too high|pg||
nt|phil:  presumably EW have a way to show a balanced slam try in spades. |pg||
mb|2H|nt|ritong: for instance, transfer then 4M, mild invite|pg||

nt|ritong: instead of direct 4M or equivalent(texas, etc)|pg||
mb|4N|nt|phil:  this is a bulky sequence. |pg||
mb|p|mb|5S|mb|p|nt|phil:  others play "re-transfers" after 1N 2H 2S....so East could set hearts and create a GF|pg||

nt|ritong: everything friendly|pg||
pc|h4|nt|phil:  Ross and Howie missed game on 2 so a point back to Nick|pg||
nt|phil:  tricky hand to play at BAM. We can see clubs fall for 13, but if clubs are 4-2, you have to fall back on the diamond hook which also works. At IMPs, it might be best just to ruff a heart for  12|pg||
nt|ritong: i think levin will optimize the make  the slam is far from obvious to bid|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hT|pc|hA|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h2|pc|hJ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|ritong: now, optimizing the make is far from obvious too:)*|pg||
nt|phil:  you'd hate to make a good guess for slam and then fail. Its far from obvious to bid this. |pg||

nt|phil:  easy for a good player, but notice the technique of not taking the "free" finesse of the @sT|pg||
nt|phil:  you would promote a trump trick if the shift was from @s9xx, since you have to ruff the heart with the K|pg||

mb|1C|an|2+|mb|p|mb|1H|an|spades|mb|p|mb|1N|an|17-19|mb|p|nt|jrssd: transfers after a (natural) 1@C opener are quite popular among experts|pg||
mb|2H|an|more spades|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|jrssd: often 1@C is opened on all balanced hands not in 1N range|pg||
mb|p|nt|jrssd: so 1@D shows an unbalanced hand|pg||
nt|jrssd: or at least Tends to show an unbalanced hand|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|jrssd: now 3@H?|pg||

nt|Vugraphzff: before passing the tray Nickell asked that the bids stay out when the auction ends|pg||
