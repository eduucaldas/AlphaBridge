mb|r|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jrssd: unfortunately, NS will continue to 3N with Spades well stopped, only to find Hearts running against them!|pg||

nt|jrssd: the 2nd (and much more work) is to count|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|jrssd: Count everything - high cards, distribution.|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|jrssd: pay attention to the opponents carding - they are telling YOU a story as well|pg||
mc|9|nt|jrssd: yes, counting is hard work. But everyone in this tourney does it.|pg||
nt|jrssd: in this event, and the final, anyway|pg||
nt|jrssd: There was a hand yesterday where Russ Grabel defended beauitully, but only because he was counting|pg||
nt|jrssd: well, I was wrong about the result - West wanted the Heart honors as entry to his Spades|pg||
nt|jrssd: and even the contract - EW had a big misunderstanding|pg||
nt|jrssd: at the other table|pg||
nt|jrssd: but they won the board!|pg||
nt|jrssd: wow|pg||
nt|jrssd: never expected 4C as a final contract|pg||
nt|jrssd: looks like East thot 2@C was natural...|pg||
