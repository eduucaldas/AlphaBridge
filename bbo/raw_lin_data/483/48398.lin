nt|dburn:  normal BAM double, but may need to be careful with the defense|pg||

nt|dburn:  maybe not - don't think declarer can make from here even if he knows the layout, but of course he's just hoping spades are 3-2 and he has four spades, a heart, two clubs and two diamonds|pg||

nt|Vugraphzff: Board-a-Match is such a strange game, isn't it?|pg||

nt|dburn:  Demuy should probably claim rather than think, but maybe he has done|pg||
