nt|vugraphzfg: diamond lead bad, spade lead good|pg||
mb|2S|an|size ask|mb|p|mb|3C|an|max|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Schafer:  bart will lead a @S|pg||
nt|Schafer:  I thought the @S3 would be on the table already|pg||
nt|kareno: Seems automatic|pg||
nt|Schafer:  Mayeb he's asking for explanation|pg||
pc|s6|nt|vugraphzfg: no thinking of which spade|pg||
nt|Schafer:  Declarer will probably play on @d|pg||
nt|Schafer:  If he plays a low @D at T2 Bart needs to hop to beat it two.  Is that obvious?|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|Schafer:  If declarer has a Dbl @S stop bart should duck the @D|pg||
nt|pdlit: at the end of 6, these teams were  1 and  2; |pg||
nt|Schafer:  No but he has 8|pg||
nt|Schafer:  Thats down 1|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: not likely anymore as Bramley got .5|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c4|pc|c5|nt|Schafer:  A low @D at T2 and hop is down 2|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c9|pc|cA|nt|Schafer:  Thats down 2|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|Schafer:  On no sorry|pg||
nt|Schafer:  Down 1|pg||
nt|pdlit: and Di Franco got 1.5|pg||
pc|h2|nt|Schafer:  He's playing @H anyway so....|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pc|h7|pg||
pc|hT|pc|d3|pc|h3|pc|h8|pg||
nt|dburn:  reasonably enough - the spades might, after all, be blocked|pg||
nt|Schafer:  Yeah, I like your play best Jack.  @C to dummy, @DQ.  You might make it and as good as any play to go down 1.|pg||
nt|Schafer:  I odn't know why the @SK isn';t on the table|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c8|pc|c7|nt|dburn:  because it would be out of turn|pg||
nt|Schafer:  as soon as they get in|pg||
nt|dburn:  South ducked the second heart|pg||
nt|kareno: They could have been in|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|c2|pc|s3|pc|cK|nt|Schafer:  Hamman must have had something in mind with the duck|pg||
nt|Schafer:  I don't see it|pg||
nt|dburn:  he did not know the spade position|pg||
nt|raccoon99:  he is trying to find a way to let it make|pg||
nt|Schafer:  Right but if they aren't running you clear @S and wait|pg||
nt|pdlit: did he really duck w/the 8?|pg||
nt|Schafer:  Whats the gain for duck?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: I think so. He doesn't flash his cards much.|pg||
nt|Schafer:  He must have something in mind, I dont knwo what it is|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: no, the 8 is in his hand. Solrry|pg||

nt|raccoon99:  like i said, he is trying hard to let it make|pg||
nt|Schafer:  What?|pg||
nt|Schafer:  Thats not possible|pg||
nt|kareno: Not possible.|pg||
nt|kareno: Diamond maybe|pg||

mb|p|nt|Schafer:  I thought he would have led "low" from a five card suit.|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzfg: Diamond has come roaring into 3rd|pg||
nt|Schafer:  One of the 98xx's I'm sure|pg||
nt|vugraphzfg: www.usbf.org for running scores|pg||
pc|s9|nt|Schafer:  They can only make 1NT EW but they sure have lots of winners|pg||
pc|s3|nt|Schafer:  The defense needs to NOT play suits for declarer|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|Schafer:  Leading the @CQ is the winner but....|pg||
nt|Schafer:  And they all win|pg||
nt|Schafer:  But he might play @C from hand to use them later for other finesses|pg||
nt|raccoon99:  he will lead the club nine|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cT|pc|c4|pc|c7|pg||
nt|dburn:  again, that would be out of turn|pg||
nt|Schafer:  Now he gets two dummy entries in @C|pg||
pc|c2|pc|h3|pc|c8|nt|vugraphzfg: good result for bramley at other table|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|dburn:  still, he will do well to take 11 tricks, which he needs to tie the board|pg||
nt|Schafer:  He's not getting 11|pg||
nt|Schafer:  I don't think|pg||
nt|raccoon99:  i agree, 10 tricks would be best at this point|pg||
nt|dburn:  well, North at the other table put @sJ on the first trick, and declarer later successfully ran @s7 to the ace|pg||
nt|Schafer:  He's going ot make 3|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|pc|hJ|pc|h5|pg||
nt|Schafer:  That didn't happen here|pg||
pc|c5|pc|s2|nt|Schafer:  If Hamman throws a @D he will let delcarer make 4NT|pg||
nt|dburn:  true, but there are reasons it shouldn't have happened there also - but it has been a long week, and these players are under lots of pressure|pg||
pc|c9|nt|Schafer:  That's the worst NS could do|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|Schafer:  Bart will play a @C or a @H and hold them to 3NT|pg||
nt|Schafer:  Even a @D is fine but not sure why he would od that|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|nt|raccoon99:  we now have a psudo endplay|pg||
