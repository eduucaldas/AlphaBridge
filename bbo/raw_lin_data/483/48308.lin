mb|1D|mb|3C|mb|d|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  Weinstein 4-4 in majors and non-vulnerable|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  guess for Levin|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  chunky 4-card @d suit probably choice at IMPs - but maybe not at this scoring|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  the pause has given the opponents an idea that if he bids 3M it is on a 3-card suit, though I suppose he could be thinking of bidding game|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  passing the X is not riduculous but surely anti-percentage at this vulneraibility|pg||

nt|medwards: Yes|pg||
nt|jrssd: when a partnership is designing defense to 1N, have to decide whether to interfere with weak hands or stress hands with game possibilities|pg||
nt|jrssd: ah, yes, EW landed in 3N|pg||

mb|1C|mb|p|nt|jrssd: one of the reasons that Swiss teams surplanted BAM was that weaker teams could not win|pg||

nt|Vugraphzff: back for more action is abour 15 minutes|pg||
nt|jrssd: with enough distribution|pg||
