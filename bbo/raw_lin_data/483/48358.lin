pc|dA|pc|d4|nt|jrssd: even if West was short in Diamonds, East prob doesn't have an entry|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|s3|nt|jrssd: guarding against Kx or singleton @DK|pg||

pc|h8|nt|dburn:  I suppose Li might have passed 3NT - West probably would not have led a club, even though it would be best for him to do so|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|pc|h3|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jrssd: if Diamonds aren't splitting, a likely red suit SQ vs EAst|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cA|pc|c8|pg||
nt|dburn:  still, a heart which is what West would have led instead would work OK|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|dburn:  6NT not so shabby either|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|dburn:  normally you'd have five diamonds, three clubs and two of each|pg||
nt|jrssd: will be a bid dissapointment that he doesn't have 5 @D tricks|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|dburn:  but when the diamond break comes to light you'll probably take four clubs anyway|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|jrssd: 2@S was a general force, didn't promise 4 spades|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|jrssd: yes, playing the short Diamond hand for the long Clubs|pg||
nt|dburn:  3@s ditto - North doesn't have a lot of extras|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|nt|dburn:  but South does|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|nt|dburn:  he won't know about @dJ, so he might settle for slam in clubs|pg||

pc|h8|pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h7|pg||
nt|jrssd: but will want to guard against a 4-1 split, so will finesse on 2nd round|pg||
nt|jrssd: will try to guess (from the lead) which player is more likely to hold 4 trumps|pg||

nt|dburn:  hard for East-West to stay low, though|pg||
nt|jrssd: don't thk East will accept tho|pg||
mb|p|nt|jrssd: accept the transfer|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|dburn:  no, he won't - this is not a good sequence for these methods|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jrssd: what do you thk would be a "standard" auction?|pg||
nt|jrssd: 1@C - 1@D - 2@H ?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|dburn:  not silly to bid 1@c-1@d-1@h (sic) - 2@d - 2NT - 3@d - pass, but no one bids like that|pg||

nt|dburn:  well, maybe - it wouldn't make, of course. In the very old days the bidding would have been 1@c all pass, and who's to say they were wrong?|pg||

pc|d2|nt|dburn:  Bart Bramley, captain of the EW team here, coined a splendid phrase in one of his articles when he remarked that a pair "bid to a normal but hopeless game"|pg||
nt|dburn:  he didn't mean hopeless on the actual layout - he meant hopeless on any layout|pg||
