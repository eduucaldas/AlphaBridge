pc|c2|pc|c6|pc|c7|pg||
nt|jrssd: if NS lead their best suit (@S) they will set up the long Spade in dummy|pg||
nt|jrssd: Hi Mike!|pg||
nt|medwards: Hello|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|pc|cK|pc|h4|pg||
nt|jrssd: yes, these deals are often a matter of bidding 1N first|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|s9|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|medwards: That is very true|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dK|nt|jrssd: but if you design a defensive bidding sysem that allows the North hand to bid, you'll lose the ability to bid many more frequently occurring hands|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|pg||
nt|jrssd: does anyone have a link for results?|pg||

nt|jrssd: we'll just have to enjoy the mini-competition of each round|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: yes, bridge is a strange game/sport in that respect|pg||
pc|h7|nt|Vugraphzff: looks like most effective defense|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hK|pc|h2|pg||
pc|dA|nt|medwards: ACBL has been critized all week because of non info|pg||
pc|d6|pc|s5|pc|d7|pg||
pc|sA|nt|jrssd: saw such a beatiful defense yesterday. All logical, but beatuful|pg||
mc|6|nt|jrssd: cashout time|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Nickell claimed his tricks and folded up|pg||
nt|medwards: So N-S scores 50 in stead of 90.|pg||

nt|medwards: LoL|pg||
nt|medwards: Good comparison|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C|nt|jrssd: another race to 1N?|pg||
mb|1D|mb|3C!|an|7-9 4+ clubs|nt|jrssd: (for those outside the US, the cable companies are the most hated companies in the US)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|nt|jrssd: AT&T is now your kind and generous grandmother in comparison|pg||
mb|p|nt|jrssd: well I'm told cable companies are not so hot in Europe either!|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|medwards: Would you pass the West hand at BAM?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jrssd: now THIS is a trump suit!|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c6|pc|c2|pg||
nt|medwards: I think I would. But seeing all hands it is not at hard to do.|pg||
nt|jrssd: but with @D splitting, NS can't afford to draw trumps|pg||
nt|jrssd: sry, Mike|pg||
nt|medwards: I still think I would the Double not knowing the hands at this form of scoring.|pg||
nt|medwards: Pass|pg||
pc|cT|nt|jrssd: ah, penalty dbl of 3@C|pg||
nt|jrssd: no, not a single Ace or King|pg||
nt|medwards: But I am an old BAM player.|pg||
nt|jrssd: not even a sure trump trick|pg||
nt|jrssd: but all you are risking is ONE point!|pg||
nt|medwards: No but the clue is partner has a good hand and declarer has handing charges|pg||
nt|jrssd: of course if the NS hands each contained a red singleton...|pg||
pc|h7|pc|cK|pc|c5|pg||
nt|jrssd: but I do see your point Mike, and it IS close|pg||
nt|medwards: Woyld be stange bidding if that were true|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d3|pc|dT|pc|dA|pg||
nt|medwards: Would not even think of passing at any other form of scoring|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sT|pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|jrssd: preserving an entry to the closed hand|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|nt|medwards: So good debate|pg||

nt|jrssd: things are going pretty well for declarer|pg||

mc|7|nt|jrssd: just not enough entries to hand|pg||
nt|medwards: Intereasting hand|pg||
nt|jrssd: yes, it really was|pg||
nt|jrssd: declarer played very well|pg||
nt|jrssd: but can it be made?|pg||
nt|jrssd: I USED to have a program that read the windows screen, then ran a double-dummy analyzer on it|pg||
nt|jrssd: not GiB - I could change leads and cards played, etc|pg||
nt|jrssd: took a screen shot, then used OCR to "read" the cards|pg||
nt|jrssd: but with the Windows interface going away...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: they are starting bd 4 but I can't until the other table from the 1st round match is finished-- Versace and Lauira are here|pg||
nt|jrssd: BTW, is anyone running the web interface on Firefox?|pg||
