pc|c3|nt|dburn:  this probably wasn't the exact bidding, but the result doesn't look too bad for MOSSOP with NS able to make 4@s|pg||
nt|dburn:  or maybe not - down at the other table|pg||

nt|dburn:  strict fourth best, by the look of that|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: probably right, but hard to hear (or read when he occasionally scribbles something :))|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|nt|dburn:  might lead him to stick in the jack|pg||
nt|dburn:  and did - the ten might have led him not to, and the 9 from 109+ would have been fatal for the defense|pg||
