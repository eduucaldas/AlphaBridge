mb|p|nt|Lady007:  West opened 2NT in 3rd seat, showing 55 in the minors and an opening hand|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Lady007:  knowing that west had only 2 hearts, the only chance for south was that he started with AT doubleton. (and also he needed the ace of hearts to give him an opening hand)|pg||
nt|Luffe12:  Lead @s 3|pg||
nt|Lady007:  spotlights on north here|pg||
pc|h7|nt|Lady007:  but too difficult to find the spade lead|pg||
pc|h3|nt|Lady007:  at the other table declarer had no chance. West lead the king of diamonds, and only after winning the ace of hearts, shifted to his singleton spade. He then got a ruff and declarer still had to lose another trump |pg||
