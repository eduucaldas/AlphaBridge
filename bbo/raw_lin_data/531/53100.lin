nt|rv:  unless opps are clearly in Inv sequence, competition is more important than lead directing, this is my philosophy|pg||
nt|thak:  agreed, TO dbl a lot more useful, and a lot more frequent|pg||

nt|rv:  my co-panelist Sandeep Thakral is pding Vivek Bhand in same event|pg||
nt|rv:  surprisingly Kaustabh Nandi and Samir Basak are not playing that event|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|d|mb|2D!|nt|rv:  this year with Indian Government sponsoring bridge team for next yr's Asian Games preparation, BFI has decided to hold Pairs based trials, 3 best pairs will represent Indian team|pg||

mb|d|mb|2H|nt|thak:  KN is going to play with KB, his regular pd lately|pg||
nt|vugraphzcw: I am sorry 2@d = 4 card supp|pg||
nt|thak:  the format of interstate didn't allow them to play together|pg||
mb|3C|mb|4H|mb|5C|mb|p|nt|rv:  normally folks play Xfers here, 2@d is bettter raise (8+), 2@h is weaker raise, 3@d is played as Mixed or 4 card LR (from passed hand 2n is played as 4 card LR+ and 3@d as Mixed raise), jjump to 3@H is played as pre-emptive raiise|pg||
mb|p|nt|thak:  pushed them to a contract that can make?|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv:  in modern competitive bidding, folks have 4-5 different ways to show support|pg||
nt|thak:  if manages to drop @D K|pg||
nt|thak:  xfers make sense opp 1/2 seat opening|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|h4|pg||
nt|thak:  but from a passed hand, differentiating 3 or 4 card support lot more important, chances of you having a long suit not all that great|pg||
nt|thak:  given you didn't preempt|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c5|pc|c6|pc|cK|pg||
nt|thak:  and 4 card openings in 3rd/4th are frequent|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|pc|hQ|pc|h9|pg||
nt|rv:  yes 2 level bids typically show 3 carrd support and any bid which coommits pdship to 3 level show 4 card support|pg||
nt|thak:  so knowing the 4th card can make all the difference|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s8|pg||

nt|thak:  @SQJ, @HKQ and @CK|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|thak:  in light of 2@H bid|pg||
pc|d2|nt|thak:  very unlikely to hold @DK|pg||
nt|rv:  can still make, if he drops @DK|pg||
nt|thak:  also, W needs it to justify 2@D bid|pg||
nt|rv:  @C9 entry|pg||
nt|thak:  which shows 9-11 hcp|pg||
nt|rv:  Buddy, was there scoring error yesterday?|pg||
