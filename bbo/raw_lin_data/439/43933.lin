nt|kareno:  Rubber bridge for the spec who asked is dealing out hands and playing for money - result of 100 down for instance pays 100 points times the stakes.|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s6|nt|ritong: the main difference being that the results are not compared with anything|pg||

nt|kareno:  Al's reference was to the fact that 4 out of the five top cards in a suit contract in the same hand counts 150 extra|pg||
nt|kareno:  And all five in the same hand counts 150|pg||
nt|kareno:  four counts 100 sorry|pg||
