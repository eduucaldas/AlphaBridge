nt|kareno:  Fleisher could have worked out the clubs.  If Zia had 6@s and 4@h and a diamond, then he could have no more than one more club and it would drop on the queen|pg||

nt|warrens:  it was possibly t make that hand double dummy, but hoping for 3-3 @h's was more likely than finding South 6-4 and playing for a squueze|pg||
nt|kareno:  e/w can make 4 or 5 diamonds.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfh: they have decided 2N is  GT in S, 3S is weak raise. without double, 3C is best spade raise possible|pg||
nt|kareno:  I agree |pg||
