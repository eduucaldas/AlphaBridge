pc|cJ|mc|10|nt|Mikael_W: well, think this way. Vanderbilt is so tough tournament that you cant be sure you EVER get the chanse to play a final again, why give up now then when there is a chanse|pg||
nt|Mikael_W: even if it is 0,0005%|pg||
nt|Dinos1: thx all, bye|pg||
nt|Mikael_W: 100 IMP on 30 boards is a loooong looong shot! But there IS a shot!|pg||
nt|Mikael_W: less then 7 IMPs a board, and there can be alot of swings out there|pg||
nt|Mikael_W: I´m not saying that I belive it, just saing......|pg||
nt|Mikael_W: 7 IMP/board is simple math, 105 IMP and they ONLY need 103 :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: The match is over.  thanks for being here.   The finals tomorrow between Lavazza and the winner of Cayne vs Rosenthal starts in about 14 hours from now, 11 AM local time|pg||
nt|Mikael_W: If I remember right there was a match yeterday that was 60-0 in 15 boards|pg||

nt|pdlit: i think Cayne up by 28|pg||
mc|10|nt|ahollan1: they have already opened those tables so BBO shows [before entering the room] Cayne +20 over Rosenthal|pg||
nt|ahollan1: +22|pg||
nt|pdlit: 102 imps is a huge deficit for 15 boards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: huge deficit regardless of number of boards|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Decision time:  W/D ... or play on?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that affects your paycheck Richard -- you don't get a vote|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: W/D = Withdraw.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Yesterday, in Q2 of 4, I believe, Sementa found a real pretty progressive squeeze.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: open room on trick 3 of final board|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Here was the ending (@H are trumps):  Ax x - x ... Qx - - J9 ... x - 10 Qx ... Jxx - K - ......|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Declarer led his last heart, and his LHO had to pitch a spade.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: So declarer pitched a @C from dummy, and RHO pitched a @S|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Then declarer led a @C to dummy, and RHO had to pitch another @S|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: A2 of spades took the last 2 tricks.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: It's official:  Bertheau has withdrawn ... so Lavazza advances to the finals.|pg||
