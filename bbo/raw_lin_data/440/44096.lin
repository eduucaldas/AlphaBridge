mb|p|mb|p|pc|cK|nt|game over: I think 2@d is diamonds and a major unless they changed their system recently|pg||

nt|chmitty: Auken playing for the partner to hold something like Q9xxx in @c and unblocks the suit at trick 1 !|pg||

mb|d|nt|game over: on good days (from North's POV) five--of-a-minor is a good contract if South has most of his points in the minor suits, but opposite average hands he wants to stay low|pg||
