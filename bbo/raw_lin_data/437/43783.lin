mb|3C|nt|dburn:  but 2@s gives East some room - 3@s would have been tougher|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: nobody asked and no answer given|pg||
nt|dburn:  but you can understand why Hanlon didn't want to bid to the level of the fit with his 12-loser hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzfb: now say diamonds |pg||
mb|p|nt|meargent: a preemptive 3@Ss by north might have caused difficulty for EW|pg||
