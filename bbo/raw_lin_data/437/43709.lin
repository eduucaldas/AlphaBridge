mb|5H|nt|rv: options are 5@h/6@d? don't see what bid of 5n will achieve?|pg||
mb|p|mb|5S|nt|rv: 5@h gives outside chance for bidding grand, still I would be very surprised if they get there|pg||

nt|rv: I would like to credit Rana rather than blame Solani|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rv: if opps lead was true card, his play is clearly best|pg||
nt|rv: as some specs say he could have cashed 2@ds and then maybe played on @cs|pg||

mb|p|nt|rv: taking small extra chance of 5-1 @ds onside|pg||
