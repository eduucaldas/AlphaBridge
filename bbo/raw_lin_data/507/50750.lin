nt|lmilne:  it can definitely be beaten on the @DK lead but that's not likely|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: Looks tempting to play diamonds before drawing all the trumps. but you only need two entries to lead up twice in diamonds, and those can be the third spade and the @HA|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|an|12-15 no 4cM|mb|d|mb|p|nt|lmilne:  heart to ace. if you play a diamond you go down via ruffs, so you play club to cut communications. they play heart, you ruff|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: Yes, looks like you can only draw two trumps before leading a diamond. then South can win, put North in with the @CA, and get a @D ruff|pg||
