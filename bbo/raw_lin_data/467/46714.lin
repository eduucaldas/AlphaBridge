mb|3D!|nt|athene: hmmm not sure what 3@D is|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: why would east not just bid 3NT there?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|athene: south sorry :)|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|athene: west in the other room opened 2@D showing both majors so got the spade lead |pg||
pc|hT|pc|hJ|pc|hK|nt|athene: perhaps 1NT - 2@C; 2@H - 3NT does not promise four spades for NS|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|athene: so he has to bid 3@D to check back just in case his partner has four spades|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h4|pc|hA|pc|s5|pg||
pc|h9|pc|c4|pc|c5|nt|athene: declarer can knock out the @HQ first then set up his spade|pg||
nt|athene: the defence can never get spades or diamonds going|pg||

pc|d4|pc|dA|pc|d8|nt|athene: east would have done much better to keep the third spade|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|athene: then if declarer played this way the defence could take the @SJ8 now|pg||
nt|athene: east wanted to keep three clubs so as not to give any clue to a possible guess in clubs|pg||
nt|athene: that is often a consideration, but keeping the spade was more important this time|pg||
nt|athene: declarer could have prevailed still but it would have been tougher|pg||

nt|athene: in 4@H, after spade lead and ruff, you can ruff a winning diamond to get to dummy and finesse trumps ;)|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  But making it is a puzzle.  If he chooses to force himself to dummy to take the heart hook, down he goes|pg||
nt|3for3:  choosing 2@Sx wouldn't have been so bad either|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  The winning lines seems to be to play for East to have 5 diamonds, and simply lead hearts from hand|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s5|pc|s6|nt|kemsho:  He can also try to ruff a fourth soade in dummy and down he goes|pg||
