mb|p|pc|d3|nt|East4Evil:  he will likely pick up the spades|pg||

mb|2H|mb|p|nt|MrAce:  Platnic had the advantage of opening a precision 1@S with 10, playing natural balanced 10 is not the most encouraging hand for an opener|pg||

nt|East4Evil:  The USA was left over, so here we are|pg||
nt|roghog:  Helgemo took @dA and played @cQ at once, a spec tells me. very good shot, that|pg||
mb|d|nt|East4Evil:  true, the @dA was a dummy entry|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|East4Evil:  I am not sure of the N/S system, but 2@d is probably weak with 1 major|pg||
nt|East4Evil:  and 2@s is pass or correct|pg||
nt|roghog:  West decides he is too strong to bid 3@c over the Multi|pg||
nt|East4Evil:  a bit conservative from N, but maybe he thinks he can buy the contract at a lower level|pg||
mb|p|nt|East4Evil:  either that or N/S agree to play VERY aggressive favorable preempts|pg||
nt|roghog:  The Multi was invented in the UK. Europeans won't be able to use it any more after Brexit...|pg||
mb|3H|nt|East4Evil:  :)|pg||
mb|d|nt|East4Evil:  2nd X from greco is takeout|pg||
nt|East4Evil:  I guess the first one was too, but here he's decided he can show all his suits|pg||
mb|p|nt|roghog:  the problem with double - rather than 3@c - is that you haven't shown those nice @c|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|East4Evil:  4@d seems wimpy to me on this auction, but Hampson may not like his shape, even with 6 diamonds and the spades over N|pg||
nt|roghog:  Dutch spec tells me British players won't be allowed to use Muiderburg Twos any more. Hmmm, we need another referendum|pg||
nt|East4Evil:  You'll need a new name for the @d9 too|pg||
nt|East4Evil:  or Europe will anyway|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|hA|pc|hQ|nt|East4Evil:  I agree with Greco here; he's done enough, and his partner can hear the bidding too|pg||

nt|MrAce:  they are playing 4@D, the previous board |pg||
nt|pilogen:  East shows a minimum balanced hand and West does not get excited|pg||

nt|MrAce:  i would not bid 2@S even if i was % 100 sure he has 2 of them |pg||
pc|h6|pc|hT|nt|pilogen:  Also, if your style is to raise @Ss on 3 card support and a suitable hand|pg||

pc|c9|nt|pilogen:  This rules out a complete crossruff|pg||

nt|East4Evil:  the risk of a X is that you don't really feel that great when partner leaves it in|pg||
nt|East4Evil:  the hand screams offense rather than defense, and partner rates to have spade length on this auction|pg||

nt|roghog:  oooh, you beardist....|pg||

nt|ahollan1: ahhhhh   now we understand why Greco had problem|pg||
nt|vugrapho3: and after 3s from s n told that his partner probably forgot system|pg||
nt|roghog:  how can we play properly when they forget their system, complain the defenders|pg||
nt|roghog:  it was convenient for South to forget their methods, the defenders point out to the TD|pg||
nt|East4Evil:  ouch, that's a tough one to point out|pg||
nt|East4Evil:  it sounds someone accusatory|pg||
nt|East4Evil:  *somewhat|pg||
nt|roghog:  TD departs and will decide in due course, having calmed things down|pg||
