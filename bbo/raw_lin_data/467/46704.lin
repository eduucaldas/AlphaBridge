nt|vugrapho1: board 5 - result stands|pg||

nt|Walddk2:  And thanks to all kibitzers for coming this morning in Europe.|pg||
mb|1D|nt|jallerton:  Thanks Roland|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2:  Restart at 13.15 CET, in 1 hour and 37 minutes after a break for lunch.|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|jallerton:  east may game force with these nice pips in black suits, vuln|pg||
nt|bjacobs:  this looks like a straightforward game in spades|pg||
nt|vugrapho1: North and East are analizing last hand|pg||
nt|vugrapho1: Helgemo: next board please :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|an|GF|mb|p|nt|jallerton:  even if he invites, west has an easy acceptance|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Even if he invites via 2@C, Helhemo will accept.|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|Walddk2:  2@D is a GF relay.|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|grebrof: Helgemo shows his whole shape|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Indeed. Only 3442 possible now.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H is consistent with their opening strategy    lowest suit first    so 2@D-2@H = 4@H, maybe 3@S  and 2@D-2@S presumably 3@S, not 4@H|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c8|pc|cK|pc|c4|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Yes, 2@D asks for cheapest information first.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: when Helness jumps to 3N he said  not interested in other major, so must have 5@S|pg||
nt|grebrof: with less controls, I have seen bypassing the 4card @h suit, so he probably shows a max of 12-14 now|pg||
