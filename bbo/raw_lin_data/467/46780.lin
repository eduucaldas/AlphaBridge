nt|roghog:  specs tell me it's obvious a @h is coming now|pg||
nt|athene: hello|pg||
nt|athene: if west does lead a heart, the standard idea is to lead small to say he has interest in hearts|pg||
nt|athene: and big to say he is just trying to get his partner in to return a diamond|pg||
nt|roghog:  @h3 blocks them|pg||
nt|athene: notice how Robson did his best to conceal his diamond strength, going up with dummy's queen, which he would do with @DKxx in hand |pg||
nt|athene: if he played low in dummy, east would not be able to produce a card of any size at all, and the position would be revealed|pg||
nt|athene: yes, the low heart has the danger of blocking them - that might be what West is worrying about|pg||

mb|2S|mb|d|mb|p|mb|3C|nt|ady: e/w mightg get to 4 spades    not likely to be successful|pg||
mb|3S|nt|Walddk2:  Bakhshi is unually strong for this.|pg||
nt|panja: 3@S is the par now..|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|4C|nt|panja: yes, a strong preempt, fresh vs vul...giving up on exploring some borderline games like this one...|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2:  There is no range on their CC, but we have seen a 5 count before, so maybe 4-10.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2:  On 18, Gold had a 5 count.|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|panja: Declarer needs to get to South hand to play a trump...so most any lead will defeat this|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  He is there after trick 1 but it's probably not enough.|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s2|pg||
nt|panja: if he guesses @C right..Gold will cash a Spade and shift to @H...@S3 encouraging...note|pg||

nt|athene: 2@C looks obvious for south here but he knows opponents have at least an 8-card spade fit and he might be considering passing as the best way to keep them out of it|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|athene: the trouble is that 1NTX at these colours might be too expensive a way to keep opponents out of their spade fit :)|pg||
nt|roghog:  fortunately @c are a safe haven|pg||

nt|athene: a good start for declarer to attack hearts first, as north can't attack clubs, but he still can't prevail|pg||
nt|athene: just too much work to do|pg||
nt|athene: even if you eventually did manage to discard dummy's @C7 on a heart|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
nt|athene: north will now be considering whether he needs to play a club, playing his partner for the @CQ|pg||
nt|roghog:  where a South's points? which black Ace?|pg||
nt|athene: if robson has the @CQ and @SA then a club lead looks obvious, to set up the club trick before declarer can draw trumps and throw the @C7 on a heart|pg||
nt|athene: but of course there is the danger south doesn't have the @CQ, so you have to consider if it's actually *necessary* - and that's quite a bit harder|pg||
nt|athene: you have to count declarer's tricks and work out if he has enough trumps to perhaps draw just 2 rounds of trumps and then take the pitch|pg||

nt|Aurora:  Many thnaks@H to all commentators & operator and kibitzers. Next session will start in about 1h and 10 min.|pg||
nt|athene: Forrester might also think Robson needs the @CQ to make up the HCP for his opener :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Since W is known to have 5 hearts, perhaps S would not have played high-low in that suit holding club queen|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h8|pc|sQ|pc|c5|pg||
nt|athene: it takes quite a bit of analysis to see that the club shift was not necessary|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|athene: basically declarer *just* runs out of steam, i think|pg||
