nt|athene: but if Forrester knew what it was he would surely pass instantly|pg||

nt|athene: robson has to put all fond thoughts of 3NT out of his mind and concentrate on the task at hand|pg||
nt|athene: well, you might as well overtake the @DQ first time|pg||
nt|ahollan4: that was upmark's unsuccessful line|pg||

nt|Walddk2:  All matches from the Open series will be on BBO for segment 2 as well, starting at 14.00 CET.|pg||
mb|1S|mb|3H|nt|Walddk2:  Last segment today still to be decided.|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|Walddk2:  4@H strong spade raise.|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|Walddk2:  Grand slam is quite good.|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2:  It only requires spades 2-1.|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Maybe Osborne could have done more. 5NT perhaps?|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cA|pc|c6|nt|roghog:  tricky, didn't like his @s. but his partner did bid 5@d|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan4: DBL=FG, no better bid|pg||
mb|4D!|nt|marlowepi: it seems to me that if E had kept one more diamond in dummy and one fewer heart, then he could have made 3N  on a double winkle endplay hybrid|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N!|mb|p|mb|5D!|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: must look at it again later, meanwhile, back to the ranch|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C|mb|1S|nt|ahollan4: we are back to 3 sessions per day   saturday 4 and sunday 2 were aberrations because of sunday marathon in wroclaw|pg||
mb|2D|mb|2S|nt|marlowepi: 5m a bit playable by N but fails|pg||
nt|athene: Robson does have a 6-loser hand so might well push too far|pg||

pc|s2|nt|marlowepi: good lad|pg||
nt|ahollan4: did 3@D show @H?     what would 3@H show??|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D showed hearts but let Muller play it|pg||
nt|athene: much more courteous|pg||
nt|marlowepi: NS still in danger|pg||
nt|athene: this is touch and go|pg||
nt|athene: the defence only have four obvious tricks - one in each suit|pg||
nt|athene: but maybe they can come to a second diamond if they play trumps|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sK|pc|s3|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sT|pc|cQ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|athene: declarer might not pin the @h9 either of course|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hA|nt|athene: north can take the ace and play a diamond back|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h4|pg||
nt|athene: to kill the entry to the hearts|pg||
nt|athene: but if Robson plays ace and another diamond, declarer gets a diamond ruff|pg||
nt|athene: so the defence have to duck a diamond to the king|pg||
nt|athene: then if declarer plays another diamond north can win and play a trump|pg||
nt|athene: and the hearts are blocked|pg||
nt|athene: even if declarer gets them right|pg||
pc|c4|nt|athene: not easy at all; looks quite natural to attack dummy's three small|pg||
nt|athene: maybe Forrester thought Robson could have only four clubs for the bidding|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|pc|c2|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|athene: ok, declarer returns the favour|pg||
pc|d4|nt|athene: he had to win this in dummy and lead the @H10|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s7|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|d8|pc|c3|pc|s8|pg||
nt|athene: maybe east is playing for the @HQ to fall - playing south for 1-3-5-4 so north to have @HAQ doubleton|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|d6|pg||
nt|athene: but with that shape he would surely have doubled 2@S|pg||
nt|athene: not 2@D - 3@C - *then* double|pg||

pc|h3|pc|hQ|pc|hK|pc|c5|pg||
