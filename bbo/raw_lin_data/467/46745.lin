nt|fabsayc: declarer still has to guess well to make|pg||
nt|ivan696:  video feed from this table: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nmkaSD7sUE|pg||
nt|dank: To make this legitimately, Manno needs to draw 2 rounds of trumps and play a heart|pg||
nt|dank: but the defense is a little tricky even if he plays 3 rounds of trumps|pg||
nt|starkist: other table played in 1n n/s, plays well|pg||
nt|dank: Manno deciding between @DAK then heart, or @DAK and a diamond I suspect|pg||
nt|fabsayc: at this pace we will lose more than 2 boards :)|pg||
nt|dank: possibly also @C to dummy to try to guess spades|pg||
nt|starkist: 1@h modern x p 1n|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|d9|pc|d6|pg||

pc|sT|pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pc|s5|pg||
pc|c3|nt|dank: feels like a club shift now will make declarer's life very difficult but the club blockage may see him home|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|pc|c8|pg||
nt|dank: Notice Fergani's shift to the @C3, chances are E/W play 3rd/5th leads after trick 1|pg||
nt|dank: so Pollack should be able to deduce the club position and thus declarer's exact distribution|pg||
nt|dank: So he will be able to duck one round of hearts if declarer tries that now|pg||
nt|dank: of course declarer also "knows" East is 2-5-4-2 by the same information|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cK|nt|dank: so he may find a winning line here|pg||

nt|ahollan4: hand shuffling has occurred too many times this week  -   i hope WBF learns from this and comes up with a real solution that creates a reliable historical record - and hopefully ...|pg||
nt|ahollan4: display for audience|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|pilogen:  The match started 15 minutes late|pg||
mb|1H|nt|pilogen:  So they will not play the first two boards that where shown in vugraph|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|starkist: don't they need a td ruling before playing last set?|pg||
nt|pilogen:  Maybe they had it and we do not know|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|starkist: takes time|pg||
nt|starkist: more than the 20 minute break|pg||
nt|rcerreto: if there's a ruling pending, I'd think it has to be solved *before* playing the last set|pg||
mb|p|nt|rcerreto: and we'd like to know the result|pg||
nt|starkist: double here worked out ok|pg||
nt|pilogen:  That meay be impossible with kust 20 minutes between rounds|pg||
mb|p|nt|rcerreto: N had the right view bidding NT and not @c|pg||

nt|fabsayc: at MP, maybe|pg||
nt|dank: No way not me, not at these colors. what about you|pg||
nt|dank: Partner is a passed hand to boot, it just seems like asking for trouble|pg||
nt|swanson:  I suppose, opposite a passed partner, game is unlikely.  Better odds to stay out.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i dont like west hand, lack of aces again for 5@D or 3nt|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|dank: on the actual deal you buy 4 card support, 2 aces and a singleton, partner will likely raise you to 4@S, and you will go for -500 against thin air.|pg||
mb|3S|nt|swanson:  I suspect 2NT is a transfer to diamonds and 3@C says I like diamonds.|pg||
mb|d!|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: and hopefully double shows singleton spade|pg||
