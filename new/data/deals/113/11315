nt|sfoxa:  and we have 1 VIP-spectator at the table - Pim Vaders - the EBL officer responsible for Small Feds arrived yesterday |pg||
nt|lestergold: grounds are that south can only see 4 tricks for the defence on contionuing hearts and there is room for partner to hold a long dim suit to the K so i agree but how many would ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: switch at the table|pg||

nt|mcarroll: 2@H = @H and a minor, weak?|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: +21 on 1@C|pg||
nt|viren169: probably 4@S going off|pg||
nt|haans: NS must find the slam now|pg||
mb|p|nt|ryskiel_: minimax 5 @D x|pg||
nt|rodal f: Still they have a nice sac EW|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 5@S a good save|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: +1 sorry|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: 1st blood to Lithuania|pg||
nt|haans: OR opened 2@D Multi show NS started lower|pg||
nt|xenya: good effort by Monaco in the other room|pg||
nt|haans: really not much of a slam|pg||
mb|2N|nt|haans: none will know whos saving|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: Jisenic showed weak hand with 3@S|pg||
nt|haans: finesse in spades + @HQ|pg||
mb|3D!|mb|d|nt|rodal f: Would said all wrong for NS if there hand were the oposit?:)|pg||

nt|haans: good start|pg||
nt|haans: esxcuse me they dont need @S finesse'|pg||
nt|xenya: somehow i don't think NS will find it easy to get to slam now|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|haans: yes NS has best cards|pg||
nt|rodal f: There 4@S seems of now|pg||
nt|haans: strong case to support hearts|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: I can t be prophet 5@S can cost 800|pg||
nt|mcarroll: As quite rightly pointed out, 5@S not a good save if opps find an initial @D lead, but I reckon a @H or @C lead more likeky|pg||
nt|mcarroll: likely|pg||
nt|haans: dbl did not make it easier|pg||
nt|xenya: can S visualise singleton @D in partner's hand?|pg||
mb|4D|nt|viren169: 2@S=12-14 with 4 spades|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Joe Shair|pg||
nt|xenya: unless E raises @Ds...|pg||

mb|4H|nt|haans: 4@H a make?|pg||

mb|4S|nt|haans: lots of guessing in OR|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi Vladimir, Haans.|pg||
nt|xenya: maybe all that bidding by EW simplifies NS's task|pg||
nt|haans: Noodle: 4@d = case of unsolicited opinion  lol  maybe north will like his hand more now|pg||
mb|5H|nt|ryskiel_: @D ruff beat 4 @H|pg||

nt|rodal f: Normaly E are slaminviting now|pg||

pc|d7|nt|ryskiel_: direct @D ruff can help decleraer|pg||

nt|santyclz: (Except in @hs, I mean.)|pg||

pc|hK|nt|viren169: not an easy guess...|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|santyclz: Slam is no bargain needing to pick up the @hq and the bidding indicating bad breaks.|pg||
pc|h9|nt|haans: i do like petter N passing 3@D tio show support in Hearts Harder for opps to lead diamonds|pg||
mc|12|nt|xenya: neither has N i think -- perhaps his off- shape 2N (if natural) was the main reason why they didn't bid it |pg||

mb|p|nt|mamos: and EW will have a decision ove r5C|pg||

nt|viren169: maybe 4@S wasnt right|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: imps to NS|pg||
pc|c7|nt|haans: nope EW|pg||

pc|c9|nt|mamos: looks as West offerd the choice to East  - I think I prefer 5@S to Dbl but 5 level is always difficult|pg||

pc|h9|pc|hA|nt|vugraphzxh: they all discussed if 3 nt was makeable after a heart lead :)|pg||
nt|viren169: Ukraine and Lithuania both in 5th and 6th position resp currently|pg||

nt|vugraphzxh: Sorry but I have on my list Tolja Oloc|pg||
nt|haans: ok|pg||
nt|viren169: missed opportunity to add a few more imps|pg||
nt|viren169: another game here - 4@S|pg||
nt|haans: at least 2@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|ryskiel_: but North can help partner discards spades in 3-2 order|pg||
nt|mcarroll: W has a true Yarborough|pg||
mb|p|nt|ryskiel_: is makeable after small spades towards Queen after 2 times @H duck|pg||
mb|1N|nt|rodal f: At N|pg||
nt|mcarroll: And bids it courageously|pg||
nt|haans: good Yarborough bad is 7 tops|pg||

mb|d|an|2 collors|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Janis Bendiks|pg||
nt|doks: hi all|pg||
nt|doks: good 6@D in open room, now everything up to LIT team|pg||
nt|viren169: unlikely for E/W to get into the auction here. A free run should get N/S to 4@S|pg||
nt|haans: DBL|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: pass mean no five card major|pg||
nt|xenya: curious hand -- 2@C just made looks like a good score for Monaco -- at first glance|pg||
nt|santyclz: Everybody agree s has a 2-suiter?|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|haans: if you say so |pg||
nt|santyclz: Like several of the kibs, I'm still looking for his 2nd suit.|pg||
nt|haans: ask him later|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|vugraphzxh: that's more or less what they decided :)|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: for all kobitzers - I don t play ace of spades but small towrds Queenn|pg||
nt|viren169: another reversed maj bid... not seen this before... does anyone know the advantages/disadvantages for this system?|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: hi - sorry - have some duties|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Ryszard|pg||
nt|haans: Hi Ryszard|pg||
nt|vugraphzxh: now Saulis is explaining his bid|pg||
nt|xenya: now NS are walking on very thin ice|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzxh: On another  list Orac sorry....|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Probability of getting a hand with a 7 as the highest card must be millions to one?|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
mb|p|nt|doks: W apparently treat 4@D as NF, |pg||
nt|ryskiel_: when I play for money I receive such Yarborough much moore often then one on milion|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Good afternon Joe - Hans and Ryszard. Hi all specs:)|pg||

nt|santyclz: We finally got a vote from a kib that s has a 2-suiter!|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ryskiel_: after 2 times hearst and @D switch contract should be beaten|pg||
nt|haans: E has 14 hcp @DK must be right|pg||
nt|haans: and endplay coming|pg||
pc|dK|nt|rodal f: K&R tell 8.25 for E http://www.jeffgoldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=q3+k874+10862+a73|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: advantage from transfers is additional round of bidding|pg||

pc|d3|pg||
nt|xenya: i'd hate to be N's shoes here|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ryskiel_: I sympthize East in his discards troubles|pg||

pc|s4|nt|haans: not often you see that now|pg||
pc|s3|nt|rodal f: If so 9IMP for NS|pg||

nt|rodal f: BBO-TV: http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|athene: in the other room north took the "textbook" line of passing the 1@D opener |pg||
mb|3D|nt|athene: he can't have been too pleased to hear his partner's sandwich 1nt overcall (promising the unbid suits)|pg||

nt|xenya: end of the line?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: 5@D looks a long way off|pg||
nt|mamos: especially after 2@D|pg||
nt|viren169: not easy for East to move over 2@D|pg||
nt|rodal f: A possible swing here. 3@D quickly run home by late @H play|pg||
nt|haans: a make if play spade right|pg||
pc|c6|nt|athene: it's routine to open with shortage - even a doubleton|pg||
nt|doks: 1NT shows 4@H|pg||
pc|cT|nt|athene: but with three, you have to ask:- why didn't partner do something over 1@S?|pg||
nt|viren169: maybe not!|pg||
nt|xenya: he can pitch a @S on the @CK, so always a make i think|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: either he has utter rubbish or he has spades|pg||

nt|haans: yep|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt is good as the @CK can't be held up|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: I don t like reopen double wit 3 cards in opps suit and no atrengh advantage|pg||
nt|rodal f: W woun't like his X when he see all cards. Es pass can't be for penalty as long as he have K53 himself. PASS all times|pg||
nt|haans: still only 50% game|pg||
nt|viren169: shame...|pg||

nt|haans: yep but minors anre minors :)|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hQ|nt|athene: but of course just looking at the NS cards you don't want to be in 3nt because you expect a heart lead to kill the entry to the clubs|pg||

nt|peachy: ok, I dont know their system, thanks!|pg||

nt|haans: Monaco running|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|xenya: losing a club, a diamond and 2 hearts|pg||

nt|peachy: Hello Hans|pg||
nt|doks: hi Hans|pg||
nt|haans: 2@S could cost to much|pg||
nt|doks: I agree, but I know her too long and familar with her methods :)|pg||
nt|haans: make it simple show support|pg||
nt|peachy: or bid 2D, nat and forcing I assume|pg||
nt|doks: now everything is up to EW aggreements|pg||
nt|haans: minor suit slams harder to find|pg||
mb|p|nt|doks: @D easy can be best suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Hopefully something will happen so we get handball resault Ryszard:) Makes it funnier for specs and us|pg||
nt|doks: in open room E and N passesd, W 1@C was Polish style and later W show good hand with 5@H|pg||
nt|peachy: 2NT alerted so I assume it shows H support?|pg||
nt|doks: if W open his ugly 11 count is hard to stop below 6th level|pg||
nt|haans: do youi know if they start from scratch |pg||
nt|rodal f: Larry the law workes here|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: They have got to 6@C in Open|pg||
nt|viren169: 15-17 NT?|pg||
nt|frankaus: 2@C likely to be 5 card ask|pg||
pc|h8|nt|athene: sester isn't scared!|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: for @H lead??|pg||
nt|haans: very good double|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Yes, Sester wants a heart lead :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Asking for @H, but non at pard:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzxh: Seryi is asking about what double means|pg||
nt|athene: south knows the hearts are going nowhere so the question is simply how good west's minor is that he is hoping to run|pg||
nt|rodal f: Spec say: Shure 4@H now|pg||
nt|vugraphzxh: As I understood, he explaiined is just a double considering partner's opening|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: it disclosed after West rebid|pg||
nt|haans: more the hard a certainty|pg||
nt|haans: 4@H = singoff|pg||
nt|doks: now E see all 5 Aces, what to do?|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: then 2 NT should be GF with @H support|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: he should ask for 6th Ace|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: seems 11 imps for Lithuania|pg||
nt|santyclz: W forgot to alert his 4@h bid as a transfer to @ss (by the opps).|pg||
nt|rodal f: Total NS EW have 19 trumps. NS have 10 tricks ans EW 9 by best defence|pg||
pc|h3|nt|peachy: I think you are right Ryszard|pg||
nt|haans: ask aces find the Q + kings|pg||
nt|haans: well done there|pg||
nt|vugraphzxh: Orac allerted 3 clubs....|pg||
nt|haans: i prefer 2@S = no spade suit only show stopper in spade|pg||
nt|haans: never never support|pg||
nt|haans: respones lighter and lighter|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
pc|hT|nt|athene: i would have said, looking at west's minor suits, he is surely worried that they lie well for declarer|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|athene: he isn't hoping north can lead hearts through and he can lead spades back|pg||
nt|athene: that's just fantasy|pg||
nt|athene: how many hearts are in this deck?|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: at least 15|pg||
nt|doks: But @D K is at least 3times more valuable, then others, so need good methods here|pg||
nt|mamos: i dont find flat 8 counts very productive oppoite 15-17|pg||
nt|viren169: pass is probably best over 15-17|pg||
nt|haans: nor me|pg||
nt|viren169: maybe they are playing 16-18|pg||
nt|haans: losíng to bid|pg||
nt|haans: declarer will like @DJ|pg||
nt|santyclz: Good hand for leading the @dQ...|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed :)|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ryskiel_: most danger for West-East is to land in 7|pg||
nt|haans: no @DK no grand|pg||
nt|peachy: I think they stop safely, have not shown aggressive bidding in this match, why start now:)|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: can be 4 NT asking for aces???|pg||
nt|doks: 6@H and singlleton @D and grand still good|pg||
nt|haans: i would assume 45@S asking|pg||
nt|haans: 4@S|pg||
nt|doks: if W asking Aces, he is very brave|pg||
nt|haans: they may go down in 2|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: no15-17 I listen|pg||
nt|viren169: would you bid 2@C with a 44xx shape and an 8 count over 15-17 NT?|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ryskiel_: 4 @S looks as a cue bid|pg||
nt|haans: holy ...|pg||
nt|mcarroll: The Scientific Method :)|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c4|pg||
nt|haans: do like the body|pg||
nt|frankaus: if opener has 4@H then game is quite possible|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: @DQ is for overtrick|pg||
nt|xenya: but 10 tricks are always there it seems|pg||
nt|haans: why not playing safe clubs may get a trick|pg||
nt|santyclz: True it's the only way to go down but it's estheticly pleasing.|pg||
nt|xenya: unless he decides to play a small @D now, of course|pg||
nt|haans: dont say that :)|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: declearer normally planned to ruff one club in dummy|pg||
nt|xenya: seems so, yes|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Walddk4: This is bad enough on a spade lead. Levenko has plenty of entries|pg||
nt|athene: heart to ace, diamond to @D10|pg||
nt|rodal f: There are a chance for 9. @H for A and @D hooed by 10|pg||
nt|Walddk4: If he does that, yes|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: was it heart lead directing for declearer?|pg||
nt|athene: south should have seen that his clubs and diamonds mean west's 6- or 7-card minor is very happy|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I am more inclined to think he will finesse the queen|pg||
nt|rodal f: hooked|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: i think 4 NT was "keep ball in air..."|pg||
nt|doks: so rest in 6@H, next board|pg||
pc|c6|nt|athene: but perhaps south doubled to try to induce the run to 4@H|pg||
nt|peachy: has to hope two rounds of spades lives|pg||
nt|haans: ruff 2 diamonds|pg||
pc|c8|nt|doks: In this board one team even manage to pass 2@D, so not biding cold slam in other room stil give 10 IMPs|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|viren169: lots of specs like 2@C with 4-4 in the majs|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c9|nt|haans: called dummy reversal|pg||
nt|haans: yes only think that can make be respone to 1nt if looking for major game|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c3|pg||
nt|Walddk4: well done|pg||
nt|rodal f: Serious Roland? After Ns opening|pg||
nt|viren169: otherwise a pass... I tend to agree with that strategy|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|pc|hQ|nt|ryskiel_: now in BaM I as declearer change contract on 6 NT|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: in matchpoints 8 PC is a problem, in imps I think we sholud try to agreed mayor suit|pg||
nt|rodal f: But don't need it. Will get a auto hook in @D Just need to be careful and quit @D8 in time|pg||
pc|s8|nt|viren169: likelyhood of 4-4 fit is over 60%|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sA|nt|haans: say that again and they bid with 7|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|athene: very lucky 3-3 with the @DJ onside|pg||
nt|frankaus: so here play 2@C NF stayman , 3@C puppet style GF stayman , works 4 me|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: now Saulis can count closed hands and @DQ is possible to play first|pg||
nt|haans: @CK playing @H @DQ endplay|pg||

mb|3H!|nt|athene: very hard for NS|pg||
nt|haans: good 2@H|pg||

mb|p|nt|santyclz: A Kaplan special.|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mcarroll: Having closed the eyes and bid 6 on last hand can they do it again?|pg||
nt|viren169: a bit thin on values|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: they are both on the borderline of entering the auction|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Ah this time they Blackwood|pg||
nt|mamos: I dont like 1@D and then 3@D  if you think 3@D is a good idea do it bfore they find a fit|pg||
nt|frankaus: transfer advances is the next leap forward in bidding evolution IMO|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: MonikaB: no dbl would mean no majors, 1spade would mean 4 hearts|pg||
nt|viren169: I like these reverse majs!|pg||
mb|p|nt|doks: pre onece again|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: Maja is brave player|pg||
nt|haans: par is 5@Sx|pg||
nt|doks: You even don't know how brave|pg||
nt|peachy: power of dblfit ew, only W knows it|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|athene: but each has a weak major which makes a double unattractive|pg||
nt|mareczek: 3@s slightly conservative|pg||
nt|doks: in open room 1@H-3@D showing supp in @H and 4@H|pg||
nt|haans: agree bid all you can then pass|pg||
nt|xenya: 4@H is definiyely more normal than the 3N in the OR|pg||
nt|santyclz: Back in the middle ages he wrote a Bridge World article about play J from J9.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mareczek: partner should also be on black suits for the double of 2@d|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Undo required|pg||
nt|haans: S bid 6@S?|pg||
nt|frankaus: @H = 5  spades i guess|pg||
pc|c7|nt|vugraphzxh: OK|pg||
nt|frankaus: 2@S = 4 card support|pg||
nt|mamos: a nice start for declarer|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: 1 @H show 4+@S|pg||
nt|haans: and finesse in spades|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|rodal f: Or well done by EW.|pg||
nt|peachy: i dont like this bidding, no matter how successful|pg||
nt|doks: so now par is reached|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s4|nt|ryskiel_: 3rd floor bid is lucky for Ukrainians|pg||
nt|haans: 3 imps to Lithunia|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: 4|pg||
nt|haans: yep 4|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: four for Latvia|pg||
nt|doks: or even 11 if E bid 6|pg||
nt|mareczek: if N bids 4@s immediately, East has first problem... he would probably bid 5@h|pg||
nt|peachy: E might still overrule, slam is only on finesse|pg||
nt|mareczek: then pass.  pass and 5@s|pg||
nt|haans: 2 finesse one iin clubs|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mareczek: another problem for East - he will probably pass - good values, spade singleton|pg||
nt|haans: 1@H overcall may @DK be wrong|pg||
nt|rodal f: Still it's a bit harder line to play it. Belive 10 tricks by the layout|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|d8|nt|peachy: has diam, dont need club|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mareczek: and pass.  pass. West also has not an obvious bid - spade ace, diamond fit... can bid 6|pg||
pc|dK|nt|athene: Karpov didn't pre-empt in the other room|pg||
nt|peachy: but of course after Hfin lose, then has to guess cl|pg||
nt|mareczek: but still happy end for NS|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: Rubins sightseeing deeply|pg||
nt|haans: claiming time from opps|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But declarer has no choice when @CA is offside|pg||
nt|haans: nope|pg||
nt|Walddk4: He needs the diamond finesse|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes, the only way is the best way|pg||
nt|haans: sometimes the winning way :)|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|xenya: yes Joe, and it works suprisingly often|pg||
pc|c9|nt|viren169: looks like we may have a lesson in restricted choice...|pg||

pc|d4|pc|dJ|pc|d2|nt|mcarroll: Well as pointed out by specs, if trumps ar 2-2 @D finesse not required, which argues that declarer might have tested trupms first as a @D lead fro E when in wit the @CA would ...|pg||

nt|viren169: nicely done...|pg||

nt|mareczek: we will see if the Monaco policy - playing club contract on both lines will pay well :)|pg||
nt|haans: best choice|pg||
nt|rodal f: By that end I would not have done:) Else YES|pg||
nt|haans: if 1nt non forcing 2@C did show four|pg||
nt|santyclz: Playing weak nt's I'd open n, not otherwise.|pg||
pc|c7|nt|athene: now north will find the @HQ and @CK and bid 7@H|pg||
nt|haans: 5@S = queen?|pg||
nt|athene: 5@S asks for @HQ; south will bid 6@C showing @HQ, @CK i imagine|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Then came @CA and another|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Which is correct no matter who has @CK|pg||
nt|haans: many would consider 1nt murder|pg||
nt|rodal f: Running scores for the new specs: http://www.polbridge.pl/wyniki/2009/zagr2009/Vilnius/sf2009leaderb.html|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: good start for defence|pg||
pc|c3|nt|rodal f: Sr. Bidding was not ended in OR. 6@H the end there|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|athene: now north will bid 7@H, or possibly 8@H|pg||
nt|haans: to late|pg||
nt|peachy: shouldnt make|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|santyclz: It has preemptive value, the only excuse for opening that trash.|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ryskiel_: decl hav nt 9 tricks|pg||
pc|d4|nt|rodal f: 6@C confirm the Q+K@C|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|athene: well done|pg||
nt|athene: i wonder if they would have got there if west had pre-empted|pg||
nt|rodal f: Well done it is:)|pg||
nt|athene: polish club can be very fragile after intervention|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: 9@H is makeable too after J@C finesse|pg||
nt|haans: N did not show @SK|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|athene: in the other room it looks very much like a standard Precision auction|pg||
nt|doks: 2@D, 2@S and @C K for defence|pg||
nt|haans: defense know nothing|pg||
nt|rodal f: The 4@S was wourt 2 VP So a swing by 4VP|pg||
pc|h5|nt|peachy: W attack spades, no 9|pg||
pc|h7|nt|athene: where north has to bid a negative 1@D first and then catch up|pg||
pc|hK|nt|rodal f: Ok. We make some extra level. But what to give as bonus at level 8 and 9?:)|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|athene: but this is a horrible idea|pg||
nt|peachy: ok, now 9:)|pg||
nt|doks: still only 8 tricks|pg||
nt|haans: right you are all only 8|pg||
nt|peachy: should be 8, but who knows|pg||
nt|doks: unfortunatly for NS, but maybe this is not the end|pg||
nt|viren169: need to switch to a spade pretty soon..|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: why Seryj don t continue diammonds?|pg||
nt|viren169: too late...|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: now 9 tricks|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c5|nt|haans: Saulis do know|pg||
nt|xenya: good switch by S -- now N plays trumps for down a lot|pg||
pc|h8|nt|viren169: not sure I like trump lead on that sort of auction|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c6|nt|athene: if you have a positive, show it right away|pg||
pc|s2|nt|haans: as Roland say this contract can not be made|pg||
nt|viren169: and the trump continuation doesnt seem right...|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: easy defence changed on very bad defence|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: decl is 1st underpressure of discards|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|nt|haans: spade to block that suit|pg||

mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  was this law inspired by some of Mollo stories?|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  it sounds like this|pg||
mb|4C!|nt|lestergold: i think it was one of Burn's occasional wry witticisms|pg||

nt|lestergold: botyh majors im told otherwise of course the bid wouldnt make sense|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|pc|dA|pg||
nt|lestergold: but i never assume anything my law is at least one bid per session doesnt make sense|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|pc|h3|pc|h2|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s6|nt|lestergold: but im a minnow not to be compared with the late Ludwig|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s2|pg||
nt|lestergold: another law is that at least one comment by a commentaor per session doesnt make sense either|pg||
nt|lestergold: i usually make sure that this law is upheld|pg||

nt|mareczek: thanks a lot, see you in a few minutes|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  so, the play here is over, see you in about 20 minutes by other cute match - Belarus (2nd now) vs. Lithuania-2 (dangerous 4th position)|pg||
nt|lestergold: whenevr i play a fancy convention a suitable hand doesnt come up so i prefer to play strong double ace partner|pg||
nt|lestergold: another of my laws is this the more conventions ap asir has on their card the more inappropriate ba bids are made|pg||
nt|lestergold: in otherwords kit is a license to bid badly|pg||
nt|lestergold: i my club there qre a number of players who will always make only one type of slam try- they wheel out the old black even with oids|pg||
nt|lestergold: voids|pg||

nt|ryskiel_: but they probaly ended in 3 NT|pg||
nt|viren169: East has made it difficult for N/S |pg||

nt|ryskiel_: dble-2@H-3@C-3 NT|pg||
nt|haans: never difficult to bid 3n|pg||
nt|rodal f: I'm ready for the next (last for today) match. My 4.5l tea waiting for me:) Next start as soon as possible. See u all|pg||

mb|2H!|nt|santyclz: Thanks, Frank.  Bye.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ryskiel_: such result (38:19) is named in Poland "piggy draw"|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Did East overtake partner's @D10??|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I don't understand a word|pg||
nt|frankaus: 26+ zars so opening by E is recomended|pg||
nt|viren169: Now the club A is likely to be wrong but Declarer will just have to close their eyes and duck and hope!|pg||
mb|2S|nt|rodal f: Last board are up. Thx to the supperb vug operator Juste, EBU - BBO and al there helpers, sponsors - The Lithunian Bridge Federation and there helpers - specs for ure inputs|pg||
nt|mareczek: 1@d probably Precision style|pg||
nt|haans: who understand|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: East needs to insert the 8 and play back the Q to make life a little difficult|pg||
nt|haans: they must have talked about balancing doubles|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ryskiel_: now result looks as in 1st quarter Basketball match|pg||
nt|athene: should be flat board here|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: Both teams behind|pg||
nt|mcarroll: The movie shows the overtake - but I in company with a legion of specs would like confirmation?|pg||
nt|frankaus: 3NT by S it's easy to duck 1 @H then hope|pg||
nt|santyclz: I don't think even Roland would bid and make 6 on this.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Leving Vald? Nice to meat u again and wi'll do later:)|pg||
nt|haans: some say that sow 5-5 forcing|pg||
nt|haans: show|pg||
mb|4S|nt|athene: defence set up diamonds, declarer knocks out a black ace and defence cash six|pg||
mb|p|nt|doks: 3@H in real life is little high, but no problems here |pg||
nt|haans: well done|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: 2 NT could be very ekspensive bid when North have something as Qx @H|pg||
nt|viren169: yes well done on the bidding...|pg||
nt|haans: true|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: 3@H to agressive|pg||
