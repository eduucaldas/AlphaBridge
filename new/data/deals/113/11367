nt|haans: and we start with a part score|pg||
nt|sharkey: NS can make 4@C I think|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D!|nt|haans: EW some spades?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: starting with a multi|pg||
mb|2N|nt|brolucius: I expect East will pass, after due consideration.|pg||
nt|brolucius: He is a bit light for 2NT and a double is not attractive with only two hearts.|pg||
nt|ardf10987: may be... anyway, if he wants to do something, may be 2nt is the best available alternative..|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Yes, 2NT was best available.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East has a good idea of which suit West has got|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mareczek: 2@s weak 5@s and 4 in minor|pg||
nt|mareczek: so 2\pass is reasonable|pg||
nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mareczek: pass|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer will not play the king, of course, since there is no reason whatsoever to place West with the @HA.|pg||
nt|sharkey: surprised S passed|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Better to hope that you can ruff out East's @HA and set up a discard for a loser.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hello again|pg||
nt|haans: that i did not understand|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ardf10987: I dont know if some defence is better than others, but playing spades seems normal... tu cut ruff in dummy for 2° suit...|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h8|nt|brolucius: East has nothing attractive to do, but (let's hope) he will soon select something or other. Yes, a trump.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: looks like N also had some knowledge....|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|mareczek: trumps now, and trump after @d ace|pg||
nt|mareczek: reduces declarer to 9 tricks|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and as I was about to say, on this hand it would be a good idea to lead it too|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|nt|sharkey: no - N's opening though I understand...|pg||

nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||

pc|c7|pg||

pc|cT|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|h5|pc|d5|pc|s3|pg||
nt|xenya: playing WJS, it might be easier -- 1@D -- 2@S -- all pass|pg||
pc|c9|pc|h3|nt|ardf10987: If some declarer has to be "reduced", why not me... (over 100kg) :) I would be happy :)|pg||
pc|s2|pc|d7|pg||
nt|brolucius: I mentioned earlier that E/W were unlikely to concede an early 13 IMPs. It seems that Vainikonis is equally determined not to concede even 1 IMP.  His trump plays have worked well.|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dQ|pc|dK|nt|sharkey: I haven't seen a 2@C opener like this before - normally shows an opening hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i see that Newton's eleventh Law holds here too---if you lead from KQT the dummy will hit with Jxx (or longer). |pg||

mb|p|nt|brolucius: I liked also East's 3@C, although it has not worked out as he intended.|pg||

nt|mareczek: 1@c - Polish club - natural 15+, balanced 12-14 or strong - 18+, any distribution|pg||
nt|xenya: what's that?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome Ryszard|pg||
mb|2S|nt|haans: Gdansk must mean polish team?|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: they play last month in Pula so probably they stealed some flags|pg||
mb|p|nt|mareczek: 2@d - majors|pg||
nt|sharkey: Anything higher than the 2 level spells problems here|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: in 15 South play 3 NT and lost 1 down before after @S lead|pg||
nt|xenya: we saw this hand a few minutes ago -- it was 3N by NS 2 off|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: They might not mind the wrong flag for that result though|pg||

nt|mareczek: trump lead once again?|pg||

nt|sharkey: 1@D denies 4 card Major?|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|brolucius: West has been a bit passive in the auction. Why should 3@C not be a worthwhile spot? I realise that his partner is likely to be 12-14 balanced but he may hold some clubs in that.|pg||
pc|h8|nt|Walddk2: Marshall, I can tell you that we took good care of Obama and that he is on his way back now|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hJ|nt|xenya: 1@C must be Polish -- weak NT or some strong hand, 1@D -- negative response, but i have doubts about the 1@H rebid|pg||

mb|p|nt|brolucius: South should bid something now. Either 1@S or 2@D.|pg||
nt|wojela2: 2@d = one major suit|pg||
nt|xenya: on 14, Euro AGRO were rather lucky to bid and make 4@S in the other room -- 6 imps to them |pg||
nt|wojela2: bold bid, but based "the balance of the table"|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Unusual for a Polish pair to play 12-14 NT. Maybe they don't|pg||

mb|p|nt|ryskiel_: lazy board we can relaxed|pg||
nt|wojela2: careful defense beats 4@h|pg||
pc|cA|nt|wojela2: it is rather easy for east to find it|pg||
nt|xenya: i don't understand that -- and more importantly, neither did N|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c4|nt|mareczek: once again trump lead would be most effective|pg||
nt|haans: rode the five hundred|pg||
nt|ralfwil: After the nt-opening S must find @hJ - or?|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|xenya: and it did make -- perhaps it's not so easy to beat, if at all posssible|pg||
nt|mdgraham: maybe an upgrade - no threes or fours either |pg||
pc|h4|pc|c5|nt|brolucius: Some pairs would double 1@D only when they held both majors. With one major, they would bid it (on 4 cards or 5). That might help E/W to contest on some hands instead of selling ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: out to a diamond fit.|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|haans: lucky them|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and no 10's|pg||
nt|marlowepi: added a point because no matter what suit is led he can win the trick if everyone plays a small card|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s6|pc|sK|nt|sharkey: Why didnt East bid 5 NT confirming all key cards?|pg||

pc|h6|pc|hQ|pc|h9|pg||
pc|s9|pc|c8|nt|brolucius: This is the second deal in a short space of time where E/W have sold out at the two-level to an 8-card trump fit. Most experts hate doing that.|pg||

pc|c3|nt|brolucius: I see. You make as many bad bids as possible, hoping that it will work well?|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mareczek: 2@c = twosuiter with hearts, at least 5-4, 7-11 PC|pg||
nt|mareczek: like Astro|pg||
nt|haans: ty|pg||
nt|mareczek: NS play also similar 2@d - twosuiter with spades|pg||
nt|sharkey: ty Marek|pg||
nt|sharkey: ok|pg||
nt|mareczek: hi everybody from Vilnius|pg||
nt|haans: stay on Marek|pg||
nt|mareczek: I will try tu support you|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzxk: they are having problems now|pg||
nt|vugraphzxk: director is here|pg||
nt|sharkey: Not sure what East's 3@D meant|pg||
nt|haans: uonly director can help you here :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: may be Daiva can find out|pg||
nt|haans: id say asking for stopper. Normally you show stopper in one of their suits |pg||
nt|haans: so east did wrong?|pg||
nt|sharkey: I dont know - S has relayed with 2@D |pg||
nt|sharkey: NS in the optimal contract - advantageous lead - why call Director - must be EW|pg||
nt|haans: just a relay meaning some acceptance for dim but do not show that suit|pg||
nt|haans: 'if dim are your suit you may pass'|pg||
nt|sharkey: No - S has 17 HCP|pg||
nt|vugraphzxk: 3clubs were alerted bad|pg||
nt|sharkey: He'll bid 3 NT alone|pg||
nt|vugraphzxk: partner thought that with diamonds|pg||
pc|c8|nt|brolucius: Better 1NT - 2@H and... if you want to look for IMPs, bid 4@H.|pg||
nt|brolucius: The cards lie very well for declarer.|pg||
nt|vugraphzxk: http://www.polbridge.pl/wyniki/2009/zagr2009/Vilnius/sf2009frunda2.html running scores for both matches|pg||
nt|brolucius: Monaco collected 10 IMPs (a 4 and a 6) by competing one level higher on the boards where we saw E/W here sell out to a two-level fit.|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ryskiel_: @D4?|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|d3|nt|marlowepi: many would bid just 2H with the E hand, more would try 2C intending to rebid 3H. by i do not mind the slight overbid because it is simple and practical. true, it could lead to a ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: simple practical minus score, but IMPs is about the big reward|pg||
pc|d6|pc|s3|pg||

nt|ryskiel_: 3 NT North-South?|pg||

nt|Walddk2: http://www.polbridge.pl/wyniki/2009/zagr2009/Vilnius/team/vilteamrunda4.html  for running scores|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 6@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|sharkey: We didnt get the whole story - sry|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|brolucius: Yes, no problem. We could see what was going to happen. He could make the low trumps for 620.|pg||
mb|2C|mb|2S|nt|brolucius: 2@S is enough, facing a passed hand.|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: yes, the solidity is important, and not even mainly for protection. one of the ways that the jump rebid can win big is when partner has a moderately good responding hand but ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: shortness in our suit. then he will be hesitant to bid on over a weaker sequence and an easy game could be missed|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|sharkey: Don't know if that decision will stand - strange|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Pass would be too greedy, perhaps allowing competition in clubs.|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: On some deals, it would work well to win with the ace, so West could not ruff a diamond honour on the second round. Here the defenders have plenty of communication, though.|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: 1NT South because 2/1 is GF|pg||
nt|xenya: the @S lead makes it easy|pg||
pc|h6|nt|sharkey: last board - 10 or 11 tricks|pg||
pc|h7|nt|vugraphzxk: problems with connection|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ralfwil: 6@s needs @cA in front and a 3-2 split, so I doubt|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Walddk2: Slam is not a bargain, though, so it's quite normal to stay out of it|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ryskiel_: Jagniewski-Kwiecieñ play very artificialy system with many relays|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
