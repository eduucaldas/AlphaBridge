nt|athene: anyway|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 28 high between them, but they can't make 3NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|mb|p|nt|jwit: 3NT most likely spot here, but can be defeated|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Walddk2: http://www.freewebs.com/fpbridge/CNEO_Final_2009_R6.pdf  for standings before the last round|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: yes, NS should take the @HK and four diamonds|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|jwit: Basically on a heart finesse or very favorable diamonds|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Weak NT for E-W we now see|pg||
mb|2C|nt|Walddk2: so the rebid shows 15-17|pg||
nt|athene: if the defence begin with four rounds of diamonds, south will get squeezed in the majors|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: of course declarer would have to read it, though|pg||
nt|athene: assuming south bared his @HK on the run of the clubs|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|athene: you might just about be able to get it right, perhaps|pg||
nt|athene: if you get a count of the distribution, you might decide that north would have bid over 1@S with @S10 @HKxxxx @DAKxx @Cxxx|pg||
nt|athene: i'm not sure why west bothered with checkback|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Suicidal with such a lousy suit, but he might have, yes|pg||
nt|athene: doesn't he just want to play in 3nt always?|pg||
nt|jwit: North would be wise to shift to a heart at trick 5 to make it more difficult|pg||

pc|d5|pc|d7|pc|dA|pc|d9|pg||
pc|d8|nt|athene: declarer might still refuse the heart finesse|pg||
nt|athene: he is ok if spades are 3-3 OR there is a spade-heart squeeze|pg||
pc|c7|pc|s2|pc|hT|pg||
nt|jwit: Without a heart shift, it will be  a lot easier however.  Declarer will have an opportunity to test two rounds of spades|pg||
pc|h2|nt|Walddk2: I think he will play for the squeeze now|pg||
nt|jwit: Moment of truth|pg||
nt|athene: the spade discard from south on the last diamond is quite revealing|pg||
nt|athene: these pitches are very often from a 5-card suit|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jwit: Yes, in retrospect, South would have been better off pitching a club|pg||

nt|calabres: schedule of these broadcasts on BBO Vugraph. A warm welcome too to my fellow commentators. Ty all.|pg||
nt|daman: but he has to duck the @Hs twice|pg||
nt|xenya: no i think |pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|athene: but these bids always seem on dubious grounds theoretically|pg||
nt|sybarra: likely to go down  |pg||
nt|xenya: at least legitimately|pg||
nt|gambit: 4 clubs, 3s, 2H , diamonds block ?|pg||
nt|xenya: needs some help from the defence|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|xenya: @DJ beats it now -- well done|pg||
pc|d2|nt|haans: low in NT :)|pg||
pc|d6|nt|daman: looks like 5th|pg||
nt|garnetts: at trick one |pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|dT|nt|mmmakela: surely|pg||
pc|d7|nt|calabres: Our Vugraph Operators are Mariana Leitão in OR and Frederico Palma in CR. Wish you a good work.|pg||
pc|dK|nt|april7: -50 instead of +500|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ady: was easy to avoid A@H lead with ace and king of diamonds|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d5|nt|ady: yes Q@D makes the defence clear|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|xenya: declarer could have tried to cash his club winners first -- but that doesn't help as the cards lie|pg||
pc|d8|nt|athene: now another club|pg||
nt|athene: just in case partner has something like @HQx remaining|pg||
pc|c3|nt|haans: some say high starting with QJ8|pg||
pc|s2|nt|april7: if its 4th he need not, but it could be a falsecarding|pg||
mc|8|nt|athene: actually a diamond might be preferable |pg||
nt|athene: but it doesn't matter much as the cards are of course|pg||

mb|p|mb|4H|nt|athene: does he have higher aspirations, or perhaps just not sure if NT is right (stiff diamond with partner for example)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jwit: That was the danger in bidding 2S, but surely East should have bid 3H rather than 4|pg||

pc|d6|pc|dQ|pc|d7|pc|d8|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|april7: E could X 1SA as if would be in direct position because nonvuln.|pg||
nt|xenya: all quite normal so far|pg||
nt|april7: 8 tricks in NT also|pg||
nt|xenya: bur W might elect to bid 2@S now?|pg||
nt|april7: but 2NT would be for minors probably|pg||
nt|daman: what would we bid with the West hand?|pg||
nt|xenya: that's the question|pg||
nt|daman: not easy|pg||
nt|april7: 3@C or2NT for minors!|pg||
nt|xenya: on th eother hand, E rates to have 4@Ss?|pg||
nt|daman: yes|pg||
nt|april7: both contract work though @D and @C|pg||
nt|gambit: 11 easy tricks |pg||

nt|gambit: colder than my ex-wife's heart (as someone once said) :) |pg||
nt|xenya: i take a short break -- will get coffee|pg||
pc|d6|nt|daman: maybe    if East was going to bid    he should have bid 2NT|pg||

nt|mmmakela: have u updated your months Frank?|pg||
nt|ady: getting too high here|pg||
nt|garnetts: Luckilly the cards will forgive this five level transgression|pg||
nt|garnetts: luckily even|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ady: I assume on n/s methods  north promised no more than he has     so south has taken the bidding too high|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|mmmakela: not very exciting brb cig br|pg||
nt|gambit: hopefully Cap will play faster than Guerreiro leads |pg||
pc|c2|pc|c7|nt|april7: now W has 10 tricks|pg||
nt|april7: 2 aces and a 5card suit!!!|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c4|pg||
nt|garnetts: easier in the old days to bid 2@H and then 4@H to show a minimum jump shift and a solid suit|pg||
pc|c6|nt|rodal f: Each 4th in the month so I have forgotten. Sorry. My work:)|pg||

mb|1S|mb|2D|nt|athene: it's pretty rare with north's hand you ever want to play in anything but clubs, i think|pg||
mb|3C|mb|3D|nt|Walddk2: The usual question: what do you call KQJ109832?|pg||
nt|athene: right :)|pg||
mb|3H|nt|Walddk2: Trumps!|pg||
nt|athene: well, if they bid 6@C (unlikely), east can be a hero with a heart lead|pg||
mb|5D|mb|5H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|apocalipse: no easy life for opponents against Diegues|pg||
pc|dK|nt|Walddk2: This should not make|pg||
nt|athene: this hand will illustrate the big problem when you play an 8-4 hand in the short suit - you get forced and it's hard to bring in the side suit|pg||
nt|athene: lots of hands like this in Marike Van Der Pas's Bols Bridge Tip|pg||
nt|athene: i might have spelt her name wrong :)|pg||
nt|athene: but the tip was very good|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Marijke|pg||
nt|athene: it said, if you have a long suit, make it trumps :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The rest was fine|pg||
pc|h2|pc|d5|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|c6|pg||
nt|athene: my guess is, north was hoping his partner had a fifth heart, which would make things much more comfortable|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Dias will surely tap dummy again|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and then it's good night to the contract|pg||
nt|athene: yes, holding 4 trumps against a 4-4 fit, you just make 'em ruff|pg||
nt|athene: even if it's a ruff-and-discard, it often works out well|pg||
pc|c5|nt|apocalipse: oops|pg||
pc|d2|pc|c7|nt|athene: west failed to play high-low from doubleton?|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|athene: so east assumed it was declarer who had the missing club|pg||
nt|apocalipse: I'm not sure but I think they play reverse signals|pg||
nt|athene: ok|pg||
nt|jwit: Seems very strange if that was the case, that declarer would be playing a club at trick two|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I echo that|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Then he would simply play for trumps to be 3-2|pg||
nt|athene: declarer will be wondering what shape west had to bid 5@D at unfavourable|pg||
nt|athene: surely he had to have a singleton in hearts OR clubs - and it wasn't clubs|pg||

nt|xenya: i'm back now -- and just in time for a bit of fun it seems?|pg||
nt|gambit: good hand for negative free bids|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: to show a spade-diamond two-suiter he might have to transfer to spades first and then he never gets the suit lengths across|pg||

nt|sybarra: *then|pg||
nt|april7: let see whether they reach it|pg||
nt|mmmakela: now VERY hard|pg||
nt|garnetts: 4@S should go one off unless west starts with the A@C |pg||
mb|4H|nt|sybarra: I can do that   and appears to be what he is doing |pg||

nt|granguru:  Not easy to see it during the bidding in a nat system|pg||
nt|mmmakela: some dbl|pg||
nt|ady: un unlucky contract  ace of clubs wrong   and a definate trump loser|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 3@D presumably shows enthusiasm for diamonds|pg||
nt|tweety1: I am open any bets|pg||
nt|mmmakela: bet no 6|pg||
nt|haans: some odds for 3nt|pg||
nt|mmmakela: being down|pg||
nt|hawe45:  You can only handle @D 4-1 with the length in North|pg||
nt|gambit: not a great contract, but perhaps inevitable after that neg doube...|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: I would also know by my pard's bid whether pard has good @D's or not |pg||

nt|mmmakela: 5 clubs it will be my bet|pg||
nt|garnetts: David would you double 1@S with the east hand?  I admit I might |pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|athene: this could get murky; which suit does 4@C agree?|pg||
nt|sybarra: @D |pg||
nt|daman: now another @H|pg||
nt|gambit: Was it Al Roth who said that? |pg||
pc|cK|nt|haans: overcalls have no definite values|pg||
nt|mmmakela: but if W opens 1 @D as I would've then diff story|pg||
nt|haans: as it is not MP bidding clubs seems most logical|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sybarra: the XX is first round control |pg||
nt|athene: we can see it agrees diamonds but east might not be in on the joke :)|pg||
nt|chemical_b: hi Shirley, hi all :)|pg||
nt|granguru:  redouble shows @SA|pg||

nt|mmmakela: i won!!!!!!!!!!!!!|pg||

pc|s2|pg||
nt|xenya: 2 off now|pg||
nt|tweety1: Actually I open 2nt with E's hand  so tell all:)|pg||
pc|s7|nt|athene: right - as i suspected east thought 4@C agreed spades|pg||
nt|xenya: not very likely|pg||
pc|s5|nt|hagz: WOW|pg||
pc|h7|nt|athene: these "two suiter" auctions are real deathtraps without a lot of discussion|pg||
nt|granguru:  As said ..a tough hand to bid|pg||
nt|granguru:  to try with your favorite partner|pg||
nt|april7: if E had only 2 @S cards, then S goes down!|pg||
nt|april7: I mean in 7|pg||
nt|granguru:  2@S and 3@H|pg||
nt|mmmakela: so for the perfectionists: is 10 the right card to play? what u want to find out /deceive/? opposed to playing Q/J?|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|athene: after 3@S, a simple way to play is that 4@D = good for diamonds, 4@C/@H = good for spades|pg||
nt|athene: it doesn't really matter how you play as long as you agree SOMETHING|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Did 2@H really go 2 down on board 2?|pg||
pc|c5|nt|Walddk4: It's close to impossible|pg||
nt|athene: but cue-bids when it's not clear what trumps are cause so many disasters all the time|pg||
nt|athene: yes, 2@H went down on the defensive crossruff|pg||
nt|athene: declarer tried to get pitches on spades so south got a ruff and then an overruff with the @H9 too|pg||
nt|april7: best lead for EW ofcourse, ducking is best and finding J of @C S would succeed, if not ....but now S played himself down 2|pg||
pc|s6|nt|athene: i think north could have doubled 7@D there personally :)|pg||
nt|athene: imagine if your teammates have a disaster and go -1 in 6@D...it's nice to bring back +500 and 9 imps in|pg||
nt|ady: if you double with west hand and you find a worthwhile contract ok    but if opps eventually play you have given them a hint of the distribution which may be fatal|pg||
nt|garnetts: I thought that lead might cost and it has |pg||
pc|c6|pg||

nt|jwit: Tough call.  I don't like double too much though.  Opponents rate to have a 10 card fit, and with a little distribution, could even be  a double game swing hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4NT for me, two places to play|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and with tolerance for diamonds, I can even accept that|pg||

nt|rodal f: Belive E will show his @S. If so there are chance for 11 tricks|pg||
nt|garnetts: Taking a leaf from the late Joe Amsbury's book|pg||

nt|garnetts: 2@D is dreadful |pg||
nt|gambit: yikes! for Meckwekk, an easy 1S call |pg||
mb|d|nt|tweety1: sure 6 @s if no @d lead|pg||

nt|daman: this is a baby slam    sure to be a push|pg||
nt|haans: do they know what bids mean?|pg||
pc|c8|nt|april7: its a very conservative 4@H though imo!!!|pg||
nt|ady: at last the spades hve arrived|pg||
nt|ady: now e/w need to save|pg||
nt|garnetts: This is a forcing pass situation |pg||
nt|garnetts: west should bid 5@C I think--his defensive tricks are in his sides suits --and the K@D seems wrong |pg||
nt|garnetts: pass is not an option but I bet he wishes he had passed instead of opening |pg||
nt|gambit: this will be a quick claim |pg||
nt|gambit: well, would you believe a slow calim? |pg||
nt|xenya: +650 is par -- 4@SX costs only 500 -- well done by both sides |pg||

nt|ady: -200 was the cheapest at this stage|pg||
nt|garnetts: well at least the defense is easy--but maybe South has not finished yet |pg||
nt|gambit: trying to see if there is a scissors coup, like spade trick 2 , but that invites disaster |pg||
pc|h4|nt|tweety1: so good for EW|pg||

pc|s2|nt|garnetts: although another club lets this through|pg||
pc|s5|nt|athene: declarer unblocks right away in case the defence take out the @CA entry|pg||

nt|athene: yes, they took the alternative route in the auction, of transferring to spades then bidding diamonds|pg||
nt|ralfwil: another 4@h|pg||
nt|mmmakela: W shd see the need to cash the A|pg||
nt|haans: 6@H|pg||
nt|mmmakela: where did that odds come from|pg||
nt|mmmakela: sry priv|pg||
nt|garnetts: When the opps overstretch like this and you have a chance to beat it--it is much more painful when you don't |pg||
nt|garnetts: preys on your mind |pg||
nt|gambit: why not 10 tricks....did I miss something? |pg||
nt|xenya: was 11|pg||
mb|1C|nt|athene: i am not sure that's necessarily a better way to bid the hand, but not bidding slam certainly was better :)|pg||
nt|daman: 4@H here for EW|pg||
nt|april7: 4@H for a change by W losing 2 @C tricks only|pg||
nt|ady: n/s  can make 4@H in spite of 4-1 split    |pg||
nt|garnetts: awkward for NS if west opens 2@S --they need to get to 4@H not 3NT --not easy |pg||
nt|ady: ace of spade right  and diamonds 3-3 helps|pg||
nt|xenya: losing a @H and a @S|pg||
mb|1H|nt|mmmakela: but no 6 NT|pg||
mb|d|nt|granguru:  or 5@H if you wish|pg||
nt|hawe45:  E/W can make 3 @H - so they will bid 4...|pg||
nt|ady: 2@S opening dubious vul?|pg||
nt|garnetts: Vul or nor 2@S should be bid |pg||
nt|garnetts: It hardly ever gets punished and is pretty disruptive|pg||
nt|gambit: ok|pg||
mb|2D|nt|athene: east should look for game with that hand|pg||
nt|april7: easy 5@H but 4 @S only 1 down|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Seems as a spot and a coffe board|pg||
nt|ady: will south act?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: AJ10x is worth a lot more than 5 hcp|pg||
nt|april7: Truscott, but not strong enough|pg||
nt|gambit: what an un-inspired lead direct ...yikes! (1d) |pg||
nt|xenya: interesting hand|pg||
nt|gambit: obviously non-forcing |pg||
nt|xenya: EW may think they have enough values for game...|pg||
nt|gambit: @D|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|haans: if 2@H show 4 = off they go|pg||
nt|garnetts: This should be easy to get to @H now--more dubious over 2@S |pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: also, you know where all the missing strength is|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ralfwil: now 4@h from S and N can reach 5@h|pg||
nt|rodal f: Inviting:)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: is E worth it?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  To me, East has NO invitaion opposite a 15-17 NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: If opponents save|pg||
nt|granguru:  4@S can go down with a @C lead.. then after @Sa @Druff and @C ruff|pg||
nt|april7: S won't finess, he has a discard in K of @D|pg||
nt|april7: he will play for crossruffn|pg||
nt|april7: ywlc|pg||
mb|3C|nt|xenya: so they'll bid on and on|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: For me North was worth a transfer break--very toopy and good shape too|pg||
nt|gambit: please not 3NT ....|pg||
nt|xenya: very awkward for them|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|athene: in fact it wouldn't be ridiculous to force it to game rather than just invite|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: but they are getting there whatever|pg||
nt|mmmakela: AGREE|pg||
nt|rodal f: Half. The AK block in @C|pg||
nt|gambit: true, tough interference, lots of vlaues, crappy fit, I predict 4C is the end |pg||
nt|xenya: seems they are too high already|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Values in the doubleton - does not work well|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: 11 imps for Tiago Canelas on 3, where by some miracle EW made 3N |pg||
nt|mmmakela: all about hearts now|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|haans: and easy can not take 4-1|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: south decided if north could not break to call it a day    not unreasonable  4@H is fortunate as it is  and the hearts couid have been facing a doubleton |pg||
nt|garnetts: as a spec has pointed out EW can afford to be conservative as things are going there way--which is why maybe NS should have been more aggressive here|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  It will not go down - it will go MANY down|pg||
nt|xenya: good stop but no cigar|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|nt|athene: interesting falsecard with the @CQ|pg||
nt|rodal f: Was W wourth the 3NT? That's woorse for me. 16HP but....|pg||
nt|mmmakela: doesn't matter about the outcome, E shd just sign off in 2 @H|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ady: still early days to do anything abnormal 10 imps behind|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ralfwil: best play is now to set up the @d suit|pg||
pc|d6|nt|athene: south knows his hand is under the spotlight so tries everything he can to hide his strength|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hJ|pc|hQ|nt|garnetts: yes but the hands they did well on are not in the mix yet I think|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|april7: N ducked @H twice|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|nt|april7: at the end E will overruff with his ace|pg||
nt|mmmakela: or pass 1 nt|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h8|pg||
pc|h4|pc|cK|pc|dT|nt|gambit: Cap might have contented himself with a gentle raise instead of 2@H as that just added fuel to the fire |pg||

pc|d7|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|nt|garnetts: very nicely defended |pg||
nt|ady: on hand 4 where n/s sacrificed over a non making 5@H  they still gained 9   4@H was played in OR|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: They are in 6@S next door. No chance with this lie|pg||
nt|jwit: EW will have to be careful to make 4S, especially with a heart lead|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|jwit: 6S does seem rather ambitious|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: So does a slam try with 17 and 4333 opposite 12-14|pg||
nt|jwit: You look at these two hands, and wonder how they can get to 6 spades in both rooms|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|nt|Walddk2: Even that lead won't let it through. Just goes to show how poor the slam is|pg||

nt|athene: yes, i think east got carried away by having lots of controls|pg||
pc|s5|pc|d5|nt|athene: controls are nice, but you need tricks too|pg||
nt|jwit: With the combined values of these two hands, you really need a 9 card fit to make it a decent slam|pg||

nt|athene: it looked natural for south to retain @CJx though|pg||
nt|athene: when dummy is down to @HA singleton|pg||
nt|april7: looks like 6@S but.......|pg||
nt|xenya: one of the reasons why it may be dangerous to open a weak 2 on a 7-carder|pg||
nt|april7: 6 or 7 @H, that is the question!!!|pg||
nt|tweety1: part score battle|pg||
nt|hawe45:  To me, South has a 15-17 NY|pg||
nt|rodal f: I agree with u Markku. E don't want to play 3NT normaly. But if W had his max(17) and @H support. Could have been the @CQ and not the J|pg||
nt|mmmakela: so -5 in red in vol 3 nt without opps bidding and no freak hands|pg||
nt|garnetts: yes they will not have figured on that I suppose |pg||
nt|gambit: hmmmm|pg||
nt|xenya: all i can say is that i would have certainly got a minus on the last hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: thats true too|pg||
nt|ralfwil: another slam in @h but only on N(!) (@s ruff)|pg||
mb|1C|nt|athene: north might open 1@D, hoping for 1@D - 1@H - 3NT|pg||
nt|athene: but what he might get is the dummy in 1@D|pg||
nt|mmmakela: now intersting maybe|pg||
nt|rodal f: A hand for Roland again. 20-20|pg||
nt|ady: e/w likely to make 3NT    but will they get there?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|ralfwil: and with this bidding sequence they are on the right way|pg||
nt|haans: 4@H possible|pg||
nt|mmmakela:  4 @H ?|pg||
nt|ady: fortunate diamond position for e/w  south unable to stop the run of the suit|pg||
nt|garnetts: The dreaded lehbensol--I am afraid I would just have bid 3NT as east and hoped for the best |pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: bet he's lurking around somewhere..|pg||
mb|2S|nt|athene: of course, no-one ever passing 1minor openers these days|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 @D? |pg||
nt|haans: opps do help  NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i think 3@D would be a huge underbid|pg||
nt|athene: 3NT gets the hand across|pg||
nt|sybarra: that works also |pg||
mb|3H|nt|ralfwil: ??? 6@s ???|pg||
nt|tweety1: not on @c lead|pg||
nt|rodal f: 14-16 or upgraded to 15 by the middlecards?|pg||
nt|garnetts: I think South is wonerinf if he can jsutify a 3@S bid--and I am not convinced North can justify 2@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: wondering even|pg||
mb|4S|nt|athene: top club, @C9, spade switch maybe|pg||
nt|haans: Nortyh pass i did not undersand|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|nt|mmmakela: i'd upgrade|pg||
nt|rodal f: Me to:)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: looks like 16 to me|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: what about 7 @S now???5NT would be Josephine for @H and then one might be able to bid 7|pg||
nt|rodal f: I'll check|pg||
mb|5H|nt|athene: hmmm...not sure i like the @C4, whatever their methods...doesn't west want to play either a BIG one (@C9) or a SMALL one (@C2)?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: I'd never give up as south here|pg||
nt|ady: J@H switch might beat this|pg||
nt|garnetts: This an occasion where 3@D needed to be played by west--but East can play to drop the K@D as South needs it to justify not just an opening but a think too lol|pg||
nt|ady: will need to avoid the diamond finesse   so that might provoke an overtrick|pg||
nt|gambit: wading into treacherous waters |pg||
nt|xenya: all invitations from E will be firmly turned down by W -- but...|pg||
mb|6S|nt|haans: the more spades you have the less partner have|pg||
nt|mmmakela: the program doesn't see the merits of dias suit|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hQ|nt|athene: now declarer has to decide whether to cash out for one down or try and sneak a trick through|pg||
nt|mmmakela: it's guts 16|pg||
nt|rodal f: 15 flat at S hand: http://www.jeffgoldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=KJ10+K2+10987+AK95|pg||
nt|gambit: no invite, not a sound countract and the card Gods, extremely unkind to EW on this one|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mmmakela: automatic 2nd dbl|pg||
pc|h8|nt|garnetts: East should drop it now |pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|sybarra: yikes  think I would run off a bunch of @D's first |pg||
nt|sybarra: tried to sneak a @s|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c5|pc|c3|pc|cK|pg||
nt|april7: a very unfortunate decision by S|pg||
nt|xenya: perhaps some misunderstanding here -- i mean the 4@S bid|pg||
nt|xenya: no doubt W meant is as a bare minimum, but E might have had other ideas?|pg||
nt|xenya: the good thing (for EW) is that even 4@S might not make here|pg||
nt|vugraphzaq: S is thinking|pg||
nt|gambit: 3@H probably help suit, 4@S acceptance, then perhaps a cue bid allowing room for cooperation|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c6|pc|s2|nt|athene: if you run diamonds then they know they can't let you have a spade because that gives you nine|pg||
nt|garnetts: well done can claim now |pg||
pc|cT|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hK|nt|sybarra: true|pg||
nt|april7: E  showed both minor suits so W is likely to have a lot of @S cards|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h2|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sybarra: didnt he lead the K?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: what shd N bid Hans ?|pg||
nt|haans: North more likely to have KJx inn spades|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|nt|athene: yup|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe low better?|pg||
nt|haans: he have cards to 3@H|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|athene: well, he was trying to look like a man trying to build an entry to dummy, maybe|pg||
nt|haans: or 2nt leb|pg||
nt|mmmakela: NOOOO with 3|pg||
nt|ady: one of the occasions when a 4-1 split is better than 3-2|pg||
pc|s5|nt|haans: you 3@H to make them bid 3@S going down|pg||
nt|mmmakela: One day I promise I'll write a book about appreciating playing strength as opposed to traditional point count even in 1 NT openings......|pg||
nt|rodal f: A spec asked me if Nunes is Claudio. Some who know?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: not THE claudio|pg||

mc|9|nt|odysseus69: good morning all|pg||
nt|xenya: on 6, EW in the OR did very well to stop in 3 @S, just making -- 8 imps|pg||
nt|gambit: on the 4@C hnad (going minus) EW stopped in 3@S at the other table on their 4-4 and made it |pg||
nt|gambit: 4-3 fit |pg||
nt|gambit: perhaps discussing help suit tries |pg||

nt|athene: it's not as though west has @DKx, when he might well duck the @SK|pg||
nt|xenya: another solid game|pg||

nt|garnetts: reasonable heart slam |pg||
nt|ady: 6@H  a make for e/w|pg||
nt|odysseus69: good morning David squared|pg||
nt|garnetts: west might open with 1NT which would not make so attractive a proposition |pg||
mb|1S|nt|athene: declarer was pretty sure where the @SA was|pg||
nt|athene: he could have tried a diamond to the @D10 and a small spade, but when the @D10 holds that's pretty revealing|pg||
nt|april7: another 3NT but going down on very bad breaks everywhere|pg||
nt|odysseus69: i bet they get there|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: basically the defence have to be very sleepy to let that one through|pg||
nt|athene: after the heart switch at trick 2|pg||
nt|april7: another unfortunate 4 @H contract|pg||
nt|mmmakela: anybody upgrading now|pg||
nt|xenya: not another spade slam i hope|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|mmmakela: he did!|pg||
nt|odysseus69: this new 2C convention may work|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: @h is a polular suit to play. now only 3@h on EW|pg||
nt|hawe45:  North - without any reason|pg||
nt|garnetts: Hard to be critical of that as a 1@S rsponse would make a rebid awkward|pg||
nt|gambit: deja vu - all over again?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|athene: wow, almost a repeat performance here!|pg||
nt|athene: a monster with diamonds facing not very much with @HJ10xxx :)|pg||

nt|haans: not my cup of tea|pg||
nt|rodal f: As hard as EW have bidded before I precume NS to end in 3NT:) A nice contract|pg||
nt|ady: seems to be fashionable to open 1NT on 5-4-2-2 shapes|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: but this time game will make|pg||
nt|athene: now east isn't sure whether to show the fifth heart or the spade stop, maybe|pg||
nt|ralfwil: popular..|pg||
nt|odysseus69: i like to play that 3H is now forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: East will invite|pg||
nt|odysseus69: however most play as invitational|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: on their way|pg||
pc|h4|nt|rodal f: 12-14? And Santos gave up by the 10|pg||
nt|ady: forced now as 5@S will come|pg||
nt|xenya: 25%?|pg||
nt|gambit: good pass by East, though tough not to be tempted |pg||
nt|xenya: slam i meant|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ralfwil: I had doubled on S in this sequence|pg||
nt|haans: and we see The LAW in action|pg||
nt|garnetts: You and Chris Dixon play all such raises as forcing and have done for years --and I adopted it too--it is an excellent idea--|pg||
pc|h9|nt|hawe45:  9 easy tricks here|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|daman: good auction|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mmmakela: the destructing value of 1 NT is underapreciated, IMHO any excuse to open 1 NT is a good one!|pg||
pc|d4|nt|athene: this is interesting for north actually|pg||
nt|athene: if he puts declarer with the @SK, he might try and play against dummy|pg||
nt|athene: giving declarer the @SK is his ninth trick|pg||
pc|s3|nt|april7: take K and finesse in @C!!!|pg||
nt|daman: impossible for this to make|pg||
nt|april7: but its a good try|pg||
nt|rodal f: Y|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|athene: he might play his partner for the @HK and @CQ and exit a diamond|pg||
nt|daman: maybe if S blocks the @Hs|pg||
nt|garnetts: I think you play 1@H 2@D 2@H 3@H as forcing too |pg||
pc|s7|nt|athene: admittedly that gives declarer very little for his negative double|pg||
nt|haans:  some blood|pg||
nt|odysseus69: chris likes the Dixon game try - with the invitational hands just bid game|pg||
pc|d7|nt|daman: I would have played the @H Jack|pg||
nt|gambit: easy elimination and favourable lie mean 11 tricks |pg||
pc|sA|nt|april7: N will not lead ace after @C Q, but still not possible to make|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|xenya: well having walked under the ladder...|pg||
pc|s4|nt|athene: but sometimes your only chance to beat a contract is to play declarer for not having his bid :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Specs might can tell if NS use 12-14 at non vul.|pg||
pc|sT|nt|april7: S can't make a mistake!!!|pg||
nt|april7: the last hand was ofcourse very unlucky but selfinflicted !!!|pg||
pc|sK|pc|d5|pg||
nt|haans: some reasons to play @HA|pg||

nt|odysseus69: however we do not play 2/1 |pg||
nt|Walddk4: You can get both, the American way|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1NT  2@C  ;  2@H   3@S   balanced slam try with heart support|pg||
nt|Walddk4: same applies over 2@S response. The opposite major is a slam try|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Then you still have the natural invites|pg||
nt|garnetts: another adjunct to that is 1H  2@C 2@D  2@H should always show two--that was a method I also though very useful |pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Here is a slam on a (failing) finesse|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|jwit: Another possible slam.  This one better.  Basically on a spade finesse|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good thing they have set spades as trumps. Then they will discover that they are off two keycards if they investigate|pg||
nt|jwit: Once again though, they don't really have the values for a slam, and certainly not after they find they are off two keycards|pg||
nt|athene: if south splinters in diamonds, north will upgrade, surely|pg||
nt|athene: but lack of keycards so they are stopping in 5 anyway|pg||
mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: and 5@S it is next door|pg||

nt|mmmakela: brb, cigarrette and Koskenkorva|pg||
nt|rodal f: Better keep for the lungh torpedo:) A small ....... are also ok|pg||
nt|odysseus69: not clear what was best line- and any reasonable line works|pg||
nt|gambit: now NS finally get a hand |pg||
mb|1C|nt|athene: 1@S - 1NT; 2@D - 2@S; and north will make another try, surely|pg||
nt|mmmakela: only 2 aces missing|pg||
nt|haans: he did know as we did HE did not like it|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: I agree--another hand type I do not like--after say 1@D 1@H waht is the best rebid with the South hand?  |pg||
nt|ady: if Q@D  had not dropped   might have finessed 10@C   and plaayed to ruff 2 spades|pg||
nt|xenya: interestingly, 6@S was also bid on 7 in the OR... -- perhaps there is more to the hand than meets the eye?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|athene: perhaps just a gentle 3@D |pg||
nt|haans: 6@S or 6@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: now south will probably just pass it|pg||
nt|april7: 4@S 1 down and 5@D at least 1 down|pg||
mb|2S|nt|sybarra2: and e/w have wrong colors to come in |pg||
nt|xenya: now do you double or bid 2@D as W?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: the hearts are a worry for 3nt when partner has ten cards in the pointed suits|pg||
nt|april7: N should bid 3 @S not 2|pg||
nt|mmmakela: time to take an sight check Hans|pg||
mb|4D!|nt|xenya: S will do it for him|pg||
nt|haans: right u are 5@S max|pg||
nt|ady: might get to 4@H here    going down|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: no..|pg||
nt|garnetts: 2NT is showing the hand type and point count--but if you feel you must support hearts how many?  |pg||
nt|gambit: 2 balanced hands over-stretching, and maybe the state of the match |pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|april7: 2@D is a better bid and later X of 2 @S showinf preference for other szuits|pg||
nt|april7: most of zthe times 6-3-3-1|pg||
nt|april7: because with5-4-3-1 X is best|pg||
nt|april7: only @C lead kills the contract of 4@S,@H lead gives S the time to set up the J of @D|pg||
nt|odysseus69: happy with 4H Davids?|pg||
mb|4N|nt|ralfwil: no lead can defeat @s|pg||
nt|mmmakela: ew has nice 6 dias|pg||
nt|rodal f: Let's see if ure right now Hans:)|pg||
nt|ady: yes  |pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: 5 even nicer|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I lead a @D from South|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Now 660|pg||
nt|garnetts: Likely to arrive even if you rebid 2NT--fell obliged to remove 3NT to 4@H |pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|athene: wow|pg||
nt|athene: south likes his @SQ and @CA|pg||
nt|athene: but then we saw on board 4 that south doesn't underbid :)|pg||
nt|sybarra2: abd @S are 3/3  can N handle it?|pg||
nt|sybarra2: *and|pg||
nt|ralfwil: discard a @h instead|pg||
nt|ady: passive club best|pg||
mb|5S|nt|athene: 4 top losers|pg||
nt|athene: @DA, @HA, two trumps|pg||
nt|athene: now the @HQ goes away on a club - he might make it|pg||
nt|rodal f: Y. No squize on here|pg||
nt|odysseus69: any chance of dropping heart king?|pg||
nt|garnetts: that trump lead makes matters interesting--|pg||
nt|garnetts: Would east lead from Kxx--maybe we all might fancy that lead |pg||
nt|ady: possible to get heart right|pg||
nt|odysseus69: the failure to return a heart may tip declarer|pg||
nt|ady: with this in north hand and playa diamond seems best|pg||
nt|garnetts: possibly but hard to explain if the were 3-2 with split honours |pg||
nt|ady: win|pg||
nt|ady: 10@C  played now would give extra entry|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra2: cant he get the @H queen away?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: can E pull in these zones|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: that failure to return a heart would be suspicious if he had won with the K--not so much with the Q as he will know partner has the king |pg||
pc|dK|nt|haans: and NS win|pg||
pc|d7|nt|haans: he did see clubs losers|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dJ|nt|sybarra2: its his only chance |pg||
nt|athene: when you know declarer has 5-5 in spades and diamonds, perhaps you should lay down the @HA on opening lead|pg||
nt|mmmakela: N's bidding maybe shd tip off to pull, I don't know|pg||
pc|d3|nt|odysseus69: if he won with the king declarer would be sure to drop the Q|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|athene: but of course there are many layouts where that would be catastrophic - @HKx with declarer, or ruff and @HKQ set up in dummy for club pitches, maybe|pg||
nt|athene: opening leads are basically just evil|pg||
nt|mmmakela: the worst leads in general:Jxx Jxxx 10xx Jx against any contract|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ralfwil: But this play.....|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sJ|pc|s2|pg||
nt|april7: suicide!|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ralfwil: S defeated it himself|pg||
nt|garnetts: looks like he is now forced to play for the drop|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hA|nt|ady: a small possibility that if a 2nd heart finesse is taken  west might at that point be end plaayed and have to play a spade|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|april7: E didn't raise, with 4 trumps you always should consider, but at teams its questionable with so weak hand|pg||
nt|april7: in desperate situation S should play @D even from hand!|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a card blindness|pg||
nt|garnetts: unless he plans to ruff a diamond|pg||
pc|s5|nt|odysseus69: he could ruff a diamond back|pg||
nt|ady: no    Lara has taken care of that|pg||
nt|gambit: Winder if W can play the 9@C when declarer starts with the K, providing a losing option ....|pg||
pc|d8|nt|athene: hmmm...he gets forced now|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s9|pg||
nt|sybarra2: doesnt have time to do it all |pg||
nt|athene: even with trumps 3-3, he can't do it|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h8|nt|april7: now S realized the mistake he made|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h5|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s3|nt|jwit: And also very few tricks|pg||

nt|rodal f: 19HP at NS but best spot on|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|april7: @C void|pg||

mb|d|nt|april7: W will probably X, which is wrong imo|pg||

nt|odysseus69: this one looks like 1NT but maybe they play weak nt|pg||

mb|2S|nt|sybarra2: N finding the opening bid "interesting"|pg||
nt|daman: they can make 5@D  EW|pg||

mb|p|nt|daman: some would bid 4@D|pg||
nt|xenya: with 2@C or something|pg||
nt|april7: 10 tricks in @S also except on @C lead and @H back and so on |pg||

nt|gambit: 2@S could be brutal, E too quick to bid 3@C |pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: i don't like to splinter with only 3 trumps|pg||

pc|d3|nt|ady: a great lay of the trumps  in spade contract     could even make 10 tricks guessing diamond jack|pg||
nt|garnetts: strange hand because 1NT would have ended it and so in my view should 1@S but they get to a dodgy 3 level--but great like of the cards|pg||
nt|odysseus69: i thot that playing forcing nt South had a clear pass over 2S - however the sun is shining for 4S|pg||
pc|d7|nt|sybarra2: pitch to clubs on the hts |pg||

pc|h6|pc|dA|pc|d5|pg||

pc|s8|nt|mmmakela: I have a good theory about prebalances; ask me at mmmakela@@yahoo.com|pg||
pc|s6|pc|c3|pc|sT|pg||
nt|athene: when you have a big trump holding but no shortage, it's often bad news in defence|pg||
nt|athene: because declarer if he reads the position can cash lots of side-suit winners and you end up with nothing but trumps|pg||
nt|athene: these clever sort of plays abound in textbooks|pg||
pc|sK|nt|athene: perhaps if south had doubled, it might have tipped declarer off to the trump break (what else can south hand?)|pg||
pc|s7|pc|c4|pc|c5|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|athene: his 2@S in a forcing auction, not giving partner a chance to double 2@D, did show a weak hand|pg||
nt|xenya: 3@H is a good stop i think, even though 10 tricks can be made|pg||
nt|april7: E should go 1 down on good defence, that means N should play the 9, because S has a natural trump trick anywaybut E must play trumps carefully, not Q or J at first round|pg||

mb|p|nt|rodal f: SR. 2 sets more|pg||

nt|rodal f: Calgary for me at some minuts. Sr|pg||
nt|ady: more chance of 6NT by west     not easy to find a heart lead from north hand|pg||
nt|odysseus69: these days with many playing transfer responses to 1C you get a lot of swings caused by declaring from different side|pg||

nt|april7: finding Q of @C and J of @D there is a small chance|pg||

mb|3H|mb|p|nt|athene: meanwhile, EW got another five imps from board 9, when south in the other room sensibly passed 1@S 1N 2@D 2@S 3@D, rather than blasting the optimistic 4@S|pg||

nt|xenya: i wish i knew what all that bidding is about|pg||
nt|rodal f: If a @H NS still only have 11 tricks or?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But something is blocking - one down!|pg||
pc|s6|nt|rodal f: A hook can be made in @C|pg||
nt|mmmakela: if they are both offside|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Please giv me a wake-up call, if this will make...?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|haans: do not understand 3@S still a weak 2?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: if a weak 2 in nv/v can be that good I change pd sry|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|mmmakela: it will|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Communication is too bad - one down even double-dummy, I dare say|pg||
nt|xenya: that was a classic auction -- but it does look like 8 tricks is not the limit here|pg||
pc|d2|nt|granguru: declarer could try to endplay S with @H waiting for him to lead from @SK ..not the case here|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dQ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|granguru: defense can now run only 3@Hs|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|tweety1: 3@s =  II am regretfull :)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: sry missed 1 C in W|pg||
nt|rodal f: Specs coming now:) @C are........|pg||
pc|hK|nt|calabres: We are finishing the event. My special thanks to BBO and Roland Wald for these broadcasts on Vugraph. A big hug to all commentators in Open and Closed Rooms.  Clap clap clap to our ...|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h6|pg||
nt|granguru: with the @C discard declarer can take all those cards out from the defensive hands before playing @H|pg||
nt|xenya: thanks Luis|pg||

nt|jwit: So West really found a great bid|pg||

nt|calabres: Last Segment will start at 15:00 GMT - 16:00 CET.|pg||
nt|ady: 2@H opening from Santos could be painful|pg||
nt|odysseus69: and another|pg||
nt|xenya: still two more boards to play?|pg||
nt|vugraphzaq: sorry 2|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: not very interesting!!|pg||
nt|ady: slam for e/w here   6NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|athene: 6nt is best here, but no-one can be criticized for ending in 6@H, i guess|pg||
nt|sybarra2: not easy to land in 6 nt |pg||
nt|athene: well, east does have a lot of hcp|pg||
nt|xenya: and one of them is certainly not without interest|pg||
nt|vugraphzaq: 15 and 16 to play here|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: on board 10 -800 in 1@sX|pg||
nt|ady: Santos did not open |pg||
mb|2S|mb|d|nt|sybarra2: its not matchpoints |pg||
nt|rodal f: And a coffe board|pg||
mb|4S|nt|sybarra2: sp likely E will prefer @H's|pg||
nt|xenya: in the OR, EW got a tad too high, but declarer managed to make |pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|haans: more misdefense now when they never stop in partscore :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: a somewhat surprising (to me) push on 12 -- NS in the OR also stopped in 1@S making 4|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|nt|athene: interesting that both Easts started the same way - transfer to hearts, then 3@C|pg||
nt|ady: assoon as a heart is played  there should be a quick declaration|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i wonder if it's some artificial scheme?|pg||
nt|xenya: should be flat|pg||
nt|rodal f: Resault after 4 round: http://www.freewebs.com/fpbridge/CNEO_Final_2009_R4.pdf|pg||
mb|p|pc|c2|nt|athene: more likely they had to invent a club suit as otherwise it's hard to develop the bidding|pg||
nt|athene: unless you have some specific way to show a 6-card heart suit and a slam-going hand|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cA|pc|cK|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|nt|haans: @S8|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|pg||
nt|xenya: the auctions in both rooms were practically identical|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sT|nt|haans: @S8 is worth a trick|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s9|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dA|nt|haans: And we say thank you to the Vugraph operator Mariana Leitao You has been doing an impressive job |pg||

nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Bill Frisby|pg||
nt|athene: hi good afternoon everyone|pg||
mb|1D|nt|jwit: NS make 5 of a major|pg||
nt|apocalipse: Hi Bill|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: it looks appealing to just bid 4@S with south|pg||
mb|3C|nt|athene: 3@C is a mixed diamond raise i assume|pg||
nt|jwit: I'm assuming 3C is some sort of a mixed raise|pg||
nt|apocalipse: 3C! invitational in diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: you can bid 4@S with south and then if they bid 5@D you are intending to bid 5@H unilaterally, i guess|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|jwit: Don't think they will bid 5D at this vulnerability on two relatively flat hands|pg||
nt|athene: diegas won't expect his opponents to be able to make 4 of a major, much less 5, when he has three aces and his partner has invitational values|pg||
mb|d|mb|3H|nt|jwit: I like 4S better than 3D.  3D gives the opponents more time to explore options on a possible very distributional hand|pg||
mb|4D|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hA|pc|h5|nt|jwit: Of course from South's point of view, give partner the right minimum, and slam is possible.  Jxx of spades and Ax of hearts for example|pg||

pc|d2|pc|d4|pc|dK|pc|s3|pg||
mc|11|nt|athene: yes, but even if he has this, it's asking a lot for him to realise it and bid a slam|pg||
nt|jwit: Agree Bill|pg||

nt|xenya: more 7-card suits...|pg||
nt|vugraphzaq: ty all it was a pleasure have you all here with us|pg||
mb|1D|nt|athene: possible to play 4@H here after 2NT, if west tries Puppet Stayman|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @D-ruff kills 4 @S|pg||
nt|rodal f: Last board up by this evening. Turney start at 12.30CET tomorrow for 2 more rounds|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra2: 3 nt not worst contract in the world either |pg||
nt|mmmakela: seems this needs THE lead to beat it|pg||
nt|ritong: 3NT is cold, and might be bid directly|pg||
nt|ritong: i would, in any case|pg||
mb|2D|nt|xenya: this might be interesting|pg||
nt|april7: did W play the 5 from J52?|pg||
nt|ritong: ole|pg||
nt|odysseus69: great result for e-w in open|pg||
nt|xenya: i always get nervous when i get a hand like S's|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ady: e/w  shoud reach game    but  may not make    |pg||
nt|ady: thx all|pg||
mb|d|nt|mmmakela: me too as we all in the panel|pg||
mb|4H|nt|hawe45:  With a @D-lead against 3 NT, you are forced to play North  for the @S Queen - and succeed|pg||
nt|rodal f: On the cellulare Henri?:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: yes, i m a kind of wired guy|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But a @C-shift would be interesting|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|odysseus69: North must have failed to switch to heart jack after diamond to 9|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|cT|nt|haans: 4@H no make with @CA lead |pg||
pc|cA|nt|haans: sorry overruff|pg||
pc|c6|nt|athene: 4@H can probably come to 11 tricks for a flat board|pg||
nt|granguru:  last hand of the 3/7 set|pg||
nt|vugraphzaq: last hand here, we´ll come back at 5.30pm|pg||
nt|vugraphzaq: ty all|pg||
nt|ritong: declarer should draw three @hs, in case someone shows out|pg||
nt|ritong: that would severely impact the @s break odds|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|athene: i assume in 3nt it was a spade lead and declarer cleared clubs and NS continued spades rather than taking the @DAK to hold it to ten|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|pc|hQ|pc|h3|pg||
pc|hT|nt|athene: declarer will play diamonds here for a pitch of the @C10, maybe|pg||
nt|xenya: shrewd pass by S -- but a very fortunate lie allows N to make 3|pg||
nt|april7: thank you all and bye till next time we meet|pg||
nt|ritong: now, it s ok|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h4|nt|ralfwil: thanks all and bye for now|pg||
nt|mmmakela: all regular pdships agree with this EW biding?|pg||
nt|ady: e/w have done well      west seems to have bid very carefully here  may get a swing   may be in game going down in OR|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|xenya: prudent pass by S -- couldn't N have something like AQxx in @Hs? |pg||
pc|sA|nt|xenya: the lead also helped i think|pg||
nt|granguru:  bye friends|pg||
mc|11|nt|ritong: since declarer evidently would have finessed to south, because if he finds another @d contract is safe|pg||
nt|rodal f: By for the night all. Been nice to be here. THX specs and commentators + at LEAST  the exelent vug operator|pg||
nt|rodal f: Also a thx to the Portugese federation and BBO by all there helper and BBO's sponsors|pg||
