nt|ahollan1: I did hear from one of the players -- O'Rourke 15  Nickell 55|pg||
mb|3H|mb|3N|nt|jallerton: Interesting, S competed to 4@d but bids 3NT "on the way" in case partner has a @d fit and can pass|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: quarter scores, 1 match to play: Nickell 55 - ORourke 15; Cayne - Sutherlin; Pszczola 5 - Katz 36; China 5 - Diamond 19;|pg||

nt|daman: heck of a balance by Hampson|pg||
nt|jallerton: I'm surprised N didn't pass - maybe he thought partner was 6/4 in the minors|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: The Cayne - Sutherlin match had not finished when we restarted|pg||

nt|Vugraphu1: EW discussing the sequence - decide that this had to show an unbalanced hand, likely hearts and clubs|pg||
mb|1D!|an|precision|nt|ahollan1: Hampson coming off decent 3rd place finish in recent Yeh Bros Cup -- but Greco wasn't in Australia for that|pg||

nt|jbgood: defense not on the same wavelength|pg||
nt|caitlin: I would have expected heart lead from Wang|pg||
nt|jallerton: I think S might be able to infer the shape|pg||
nt|jallerton: @dA at trick 1 looks like a singleton opposite|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and @S suggests  about to crossruff|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Greco has been studying, sighing a little, thinking - we aren't frozen or anything (even I am not, since the players nicely moved the table around so I'm no longer under the AC)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: I believe Eric [Greco] and Hampson [Geoff] BOTH have reputation for going into the tank|pg||

nt|jallerton: I suspect they are in a game forcing auction now|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Zhuang & Greco making signals with their fingers - couldn't figure out what at first, but Zhuang was asking Greco what his shape was on the last hand :)|pg||

nt|Vugraphu1: 1@h was alerted on both sides but no one asked and no explanation, so I can't tell you exactly what it is - where's Walter Johnson when we need him? (probably playing)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu1: Walter is the Meckwell expert and same for this pair|pg||
