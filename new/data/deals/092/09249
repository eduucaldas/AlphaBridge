nt|othered1: If you told me they were playing this system,I might find 6@D easier to bid, but it's still not a great spot|pg||
nt|vugraphzkf: strong club, 4 card major with reverse canape written on their CC|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|othered1: with 4@S,north has taken this off the @D track, at least temporarily|pg||

mb|p|mb|4H|an|rkc !D|nt|dburn: winning is as winning does - could not Weinstein have made four?|pg||
