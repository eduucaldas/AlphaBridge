mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dan_ehh: interesting lead problem now|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North may find the club lead now |pg||
nt|ralfwil: Or a small @d?|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: norrth's suits have all been bid except for @C so maybe he will indeed find it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@C either natural or any 16+   2@D  8+   3@D natural game-force|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: small @d will probably work too as declarer should play the 9 and not the jack|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Which in fact cuts all communications to W:s hand|pg||
nt|jbgood: and may be a reason to put in the jack..|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: still a possibility to fall back on @S maybe?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North is having quite a long think about his lead.|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: no real reason to expect @Hs to behave well enough so on a @D lead might win the ace and try the @S finesse|pg||
pc|s6|nt|dan_ehh: interesting choice..|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|pc|s3|pg||
nt|jbgood: but a @d lead was not very tempting|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Israel the holders. 2 of the 3 pairs competing again this year (Segev-Tal replaced by Fisher-Schwartz)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and Ofir replaced by Padon|pg||
nt|dan_ehh: 3 original playes|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|pc|c8|nt|ralfwil: can this lead create a bad view of the @s distribution?|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Some people, of course, would have asked lots of questions about the 2@C bid - "Oh, so it doesn't show clubs then?" - one advantage of screens |pg||

pc|hA|pc|d3|pc|d2|pg||
