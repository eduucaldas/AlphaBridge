nt|jvage: He reasonably expected a bit more from North|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|vugraphzmj: and board 16 is a bad one for interface|pg||
mb|2H|nt|vugraphzmj: it isn't yet compared|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|mtvesuvius: yes, so they need imps quickly|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|mtvesuvius: unfortunately it looks like they won't have much to work with on the next few boards|pg||
nt|yke: I dont see any boards where they can win imps|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|yke: so BBE wins|pg||
mb|p|nt|mtvesuvius: probably|pg||
nt|vugraphzmj: and if 4@h goes down?|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mtvesuvius: then it will be interesting :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mtvesuvius: it always is interesting, but it will be exciting to watch then :)|pg||

pc|d2|pc|d9|pc|dQ|nt|bridge_one: Olsen valuate his @S very weak after 1nt by East - good choise|pg||
nt|jbgood: a pass of 2 @h would have been even more profitable|pg||

pc|cK|pc|cJ|pc|s3|nt|jbgood: game is difficult to bid after E's inbid. I think S should try 3 @c|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@H isn't forcing, so 3@C can be a reasonable choise|pg||
nt|jbgood: right - if he wanted to force he had to double first|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Now for North a big problem ! 3@H 3@S 4@H ?|pg||
nt|robinswr: doesn't 2hearts show six?|pg||
nt|jbgood: I think bidding spades 2 times is enough with a NT on your back|pg||
nt|bridge_one: uhmm, i suppose 5 cards are sufficient - and remember we are in individual, so no high agreements|pg||
nt|jbgood: often Steve - but...|pg||
nt|vugraphzer: http://nbfdata.bridge.no/Turnering/default.asp?Fil=dnof|pg||
nt|sharkey: this hand also shows how powerful the Aces are in bridge|pg||
nt|bridge_one: however 4@H need to make 5@C, so J in @c must be second or @C 3/3|pg||

mc|8|nt|hedyg: last board of this match|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: somehow they need to manage 3 IMPs on this last board|pg||

nt|vugraphzmj: or maybe 2 is enough, for total-points or a tie-break|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Thanks Hedy, Yke and Adam :)|pg||
