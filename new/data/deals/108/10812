nt|elbec: welcome to this semifinal between Italy and USA|pg||
nt|chick: or 3 :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: E is one of the several good Drijver brothers:) Bob I think|pg||
nt|gulyas: OK, confirmed, its Bob|pg||
nt|gulyas: 2@C either a multi of some sort, or a major 2 suiter (but my guess is, its a multi variation)|pg||
nt|gulyas: 2@S was pass or correct|pg||
nt|chick: which means W may need to decide if 3@S could be a real suit|pg||
nt|gulyas: the double was just showing a good hand I would think, and I have no clue what 3@S would want to mean:)|pg||
nt|gulyas: OK, I am told that 2@C was in fact BOTH majors|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Joe Shair|pg||
nt|gulyas: 5-4 and up|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi folks.|pg||
nt|gulyas: hey Joe:)|pg||
nt|jstokes: will likely get to slam now; will make with a heart lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzur: 2 rounds,each rounds 14 boards|pg||
nt|gulyas: Italy Red beat France in an easy match, whereas USA Blue had to sweat it out and win by 1 IMP against Greece|pg||
nt|elbec: manno di franco play weak NT, with a "Nightmare" approach|pg||
nt|ady: west has too much defence to pre-empt   and not enough for game |pg||
nt|frankaus: i would think W has too much to sac and too little to make game opp a min 5/5|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherdano:  this seems like the normal auction|pg||
nt|elbec: second section of semifinal between italy and usa|pg||
pc|s6|nt|april7: without a @S lead are 5 @C possible but 5@D bye NS are in|pg||
nt|april7: 6@C though is a good save by EW|pg||
nt|mdgraham: some might have bid 2@D over 1@H with the North hand - king to six not to be sneezed at |pg||
nt|santyclz: Re Daniel.|pg||
nt|andyv:  Hi Ozgur and Daniel|pg||
nt|gulyas: hello everyone, welcome to the second half of the QFs |pg||
nt|gulyas: which was a surprise since they won the prelims by a huge margin|pg||
nt|vugraphzur: HÝ ALL WELCOME|pg||
nt|elbec: this is going to be expensive for USA|pg||
nt|frankaus: snap :)|pg||
nt|ady: south worried   but has to trust |pg||
nt|mcarroll: We all think the same so|pg||
pc|s3|nt|gulyas: USA Blue topped the field after 13 rounds, by a huge 46VP margin, so they are the hot favourites here|pg||
nt|garnetts: No reason for west not to lead a heart--|pg||
nt|garnetts: The contract is safe anyway|pg||
nt|gulyas: altho a @S lead would have been more testing|pg||
nt|frankaus: i dont recommend preempting with 2 Aces in any event|pg||
nt|ady: might be able to get an end play for down 1|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mdgraham: easy 3NT first up|pg||
nt|gulyas: hello all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Istanbul.09/Asp/RoundTeams.asp?qtournid=724&qroundno=10  for standings after 10 rounds. First 8 after 13 rounds advance to the quarter-finals ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: tomorrow|pg||
nt|mdgraham: NS getting to 5@D now|pg||
nt|jstokes: East wondering if the @HK is worth anything (it is :))|pg||
nt|gulyas: hey Joe:)|pg||
nt|jstokes: Hi Daniel|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|gulyas: N will pull that|pg||
nt|gulyas: he does have a 6card support and a void after all:)|pg||
nt|gulyas: so then obv 3@S was SHOWING stop, since the opps have 2 suits|pg||
nt|gulyas: hello Andy, Ozgur|pg||
nt|andyv:  good contract|pg||
pc|sK|nt|cherdano:  North is 5-5 but has bad suits and the wrong shape to act over 2@H in the passout seat|pg||
nt|gulyas: yes, well bid by NS|pg||
nt|ady: first the bad news|pg||
nt|april7: 1 down probably|pg||
pc|s4|nt|gulyas: hmm|pg||

nt|don paulus: ciao :)|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|gulyas: :)|pg||
nt|april7: and no defensive values at all and is vul. so a pullwould be obvious, but I also think the X was not the best bid|pg||
nt|gulyas: I agree with that too|pg||
nt|chick: Hi Joe :)|pg||
nt|gulyas: and hoping for 3NT with @H stop, but that all was messed up by S's 4@S bid|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Istanbul.09/Asp/RoundTeams.asp?qtournid=724&qroundno=12  for standings after 12 rounds. Top 8 after this round advance to the quarter-finals ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: tomorrow|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi Corielia.  |pg||
nt|chick: I don't know about "messed up", NS down at least a couple :)|pg||
nt|gulyas: it would be hard to read that it takes a @D lead to beat slam|pg||
nt|frankaus: and further sac at 5 level green V green is rarely a huge sucess|pg||
pc|h6|nt|gulyas: so currently, Italy Red are 5th, Australia 9th, both fighting for qualification|pg||
nt|gulyas: it is so good that it actually makes:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  :)|pg||
nt|jstokes: diamond lead will be successfull but seems impossible to find|pg||
nt|gulyas: with the lucky lie of cards (@Cs 3-3) the losing @D can be discarded|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hK|nt|april7: rather 6@D than X i would suggest|pg||
nt|gulyas: a good convention here would have been the so called Polish double by N (showing an interest in some OTHER suit but the one he bid and got cued on)|pg||
nt|sybarra: going nicely for declarer |pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|gulyas: well, their well thought out defence was messed up:)|pg||
pc|d7|nt|gulyas: Greecoura is a Greek team, they finished 5th in the preliminaries|pg||
nt|andyv:  nothing to the play|pg||
nt|gulyas: I assume USA Blue picked them as opponents for the QF|pg||
nt|andyv:  and the USA team chose them for this round.|pg||
nt|rgdruru: hi|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|nt|april7: but one should not be to greedy|pg||
nt|garnetts: well it would be more testing but will still make --provided declarer holds up and takes two finesses into east|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|gulyas: it looks like NS loses at least 1 trick in each suit|pg||
nt|santyclz: Quite a x by w with his powerhouse.  Looks as if it will work out well though.|pg||
nt|gulyas: it would still have been a 50-50 shot at best for S to find out which minor to lead|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d4|nt|garnetts: would have to take it on a spade lead|pg||
nt|gulyas: probably|pg||
nt|gulyas: he is afraid that all finesses are off|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|santyclz: Excuse me, *her* powerhouse.|pg||
nt|chick: well, E did double and then cuebid even with W's pass|pg||
nt|april7: S should have returned @D second trick and not playing @S|pg||
pc|h9|nt|gulyas: he did refuse one finesse already...|pg||
pc|c3|pc|h5|nt|mdgraham: declarer will not be certain who has the long clubs - if he thinks East has them, he will play diamonds normally - if West, he may run @DJ  |pg||
nt|gulyas: so if he ducks this, he gets a @H play, and the defense will have 5 tricks|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|gulyas: forcing dummy is a good idea, that way they cannot use the side suit in @Hs|pg||
pc|h8|nt|gulyas: so if @Ss are 6-2, he has to take it|pg||
nt|gulyas: but he got it right|pg||
nt|garnetts: Might go off if he plays east to have bared a notional K@D in the end game|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/VGData/minirama.html  for running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|gulyas: he also might go off if he tries to endplay E|pg||
nt|ady: elominate hearts  and spades and end play south with KX clubs|pg||
pc|c5|nt|mcarroll: Same bidding in Open|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|gulyas: 4@H would have been 1 off probably|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|gulyas: they are lucky this went down at all|pg||
nt|gulyas: with @Ds 1-1|pg||
nt|gulyas: unless they find the @S ruff|pg||
nt|chick: this is going to be a big swing to start the round ... wonder how it will affect morale for the rest|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3S does not exactly seem automatic in reply to a reopening double, but it certainly has worked out well here|pg||
nt|gulyas: declarer sighs of relief when he sees the @C discard|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|gulyas: he will just play them normally, it is not likely that W plays @Cs that way if he had 5 of them|pg||
nt|mdgraham: either of which will work|pg||
nt|gulyas: right now, the @D finesse looks safe|pg||
pc|h4|pc|c4|pc|d5|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c2|pc|c6|nt|gulyas: oh-oh, he is going for the endplay|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ady: nicely  done|pg||
pc|d6|nt|garnetts: Strange hand but he played it well--the operation was a success but the patient died |pg||
pc|s5|pc|d8|pg||
nt|chick: W has a problem... can't draw trump and still get back to his hand for clubs, will still have to lose a @D|pg||

nt|Walddk4: tomorrow|pg||
nt|andyv:  same contract in OR|pg||
nt|garnetts: I think decalrer deserved that for a fine line of play--but east will be gutted|pg||
nt|gulyas: the only time he cannot take the @D finesse was if @Ss were 4-4|pg||
nt|elbec: same lead in the open room|pg||
nt|elbec: and same result...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: club ten dropping on second round would also see the slam home'|pg||
nt|frankaus: could S work out to unblock !K or is that too much double dummy|pg||
nt|frankaus: @CK|pg||
nt|mcarroll: This board looks good for Italy as S is in 4@H dbl in Open|pg||
nt|chick: the @D9 proved very useful|pg||
nt|april7: the 3@H bid was premature also|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3H a bt aggressive fcing a nonvul 2D bidder. might turn plus into minus for no reason. opps have not competed yet and may not do so over 2H or 2S as they do not know you have a ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: real fit. you can always go to 3M later if need be|pg||
mb|3C|nt|gulyas: but if the @Ss ran, he had 9 tricks from top|pg||
nt|mdgraham: still, if @SJ had fallen, he would have had nine on top|pg||
nt|april7: an easy 3NT by NS|pg||
nt|andyv:  E hand a deceptively poor opener|pg||
nt|gulyas: 3 aces is always a good opener|pg||
nt|gulyas: right|pg||

nt|gulyas: so I don't totally agree with you there|pg||
nt|elbec: good result for NS in open room|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|gulyas: EW can try 3NT, but it fails if it gets a @D lead|pg||
nt|gulyas: but yes, it was E who did the last wrong thing|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 6@H a lucky make|pg||
nt|ady: n/s likely to play 3NT    may fail on a spade lead   must be low from west|pg||
mb|p|nt|elbec: 12-14 no trump|pg||
pc|d2|nt|cherdano:  and 2NT artificial?|pg||
nt|nulda: North player - Michal Kopecky - had a bid success at San Remo a month ago|pg||
nt|nulda: 5th place in Open Pairs category|pg||
nt|cherdano:  that is a nice result indeed|pg||
nt|nulda: 2NT relay|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that 1@C opening is not so much skinny as anorexic |pg||
nt|mdgraham: as Daniel said,,passing 5@Cx with a void and six card trump support just looked wrong|pg||
nt|april7: 9 or 10 tricks, depending on the play|pg||
nt|vugraphzur: nt:12-14|pg||
nt|jstokes: club lead seems best for the def; might hold it to 7 tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: screeching in with 9 tricks |pg||
nt|chick: I don't like the 3@C preempt here|pg||
pc|d6|nt|andyv:  no spot cards make the hand poor|pg||
nt|gulyas: spot cards are bad, agree there|pg||
nt|andyv:  @d lead almost called for on this auction|pg||
nt|gulyas: lets see if S finds the killing lead|pg||
nt|gulyas: unless pd has a @H honor...|pg||
nt|gulyas: but I agree, @Ds should be led|pg||
nt|andyv:  sometimes you have to trust the opps|pg||
pc|dK|nt|gulyas: weird|pg||
nt|gulyas: 2@C as we have seen is both majors, x probably showing a wk NT worth hand, or any strong hand|pg||
nt|gulyas: since this time its 13 balanced, she passed the forward-going 3@C|pg||
nt|gulyas: this looks like 4 tricks off the top, but with the @H ruff also coming, it will probably go down|pg||
nt|gulyas: oh-oh|pg||
nt|elbec: 1nt is 5+@s|pg||
nt|elbec: 2@c is any 15+|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|andyv:  this will be over quickly|pg||
nt|april7: lucky 9 tricks|pg||
pc|d3|nt|nulda: 3s minimum |pg||
nt|gulyas: with trumps not behaving, 2@S is the limit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but you can't imagine South passing now|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 5 imps, as 6@Cx-2 in the Open Room|pg||
nt|garnetts: The killing lead --if South gets it right|pg||
nt|elbec: 2@d is 8+|pg||
nt|elbec: 2nt is 15/17 with 4@c or 4@d|pg||
nt|frankaus: 2Nt should be passed out |pg||
pc|d5|nt|cherdano:  and South has second thoughts about inviting?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: o\_/ hand|pg||
nt|chick: excellent duck|pg||
nt|santyclz: Lovely.  Tough play.|pg||
nt|ady: yes    |pg||
nt|chick: first seat with 4 hearts|pg||
nt|april7: 11 now|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure I do either with 4 @H  but then I am old fashioned|pg||
nt|april7: and only 6 @C|pg||
pc|dA|nt|cherdano:  on a diamond lead South will set up clubs and a club ruff for an easy +650|pg||
nt|nulda: just two aces to give|pg||
nt|vugraphzur: Nab is calling TD after 4@s|pg||
nt|cherdano:  oh - if north bid a slow 3@S then there may be a problem|pg||
nt|nulda: I dont think, there should be a problem|pg||

nt|Walddk2: tomorrow|pg||
nt|nulda: 4@s normal bid after 2s of N|pg||
nt|gulyas: well, if N's bidding suggested an 11-13 range, I would|pg||
nt|gulyas: duck is a good move, now he just needs to have his entries to take all the finesses he needs|pg||
nt|marlowepi: since this is more or less a nothing hand, i have some thoughts on the previous deal, regarding multi vs a weak two....|pg||
nt|elbec: I'm doublechecking|pg||
nt|mcarroll: If they are to be in game S has to bid it - N can never make a positive move|pg||
nt|ady: yes   agree    but game would likely fail|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|cherdano:  yes but why did South bid 2N?|pg||
nt|gulyas: S only trusted his own suit, and that backfired|pg||
nt|gulyas: he has to take this and return it, or duck the 1st round|pg||
nt|frankaus: J, 2T's, 2 9's reminds of my rubber bridge hands|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, too many flaws, the worst of which is an insufficient offense-to-defense ratio|pg||
pc|s3|nt|gulyas: since N's @S10 can be the setting trick|pg||
nt|gulyas: oh|pg||
nt|don paulus: guess got to go down here|pg||
nt|rgdruru: yes, 2 down|pg||
nt|elbec: it seems that 2nt is 6+@h ...|pg||
nt|elbec: 3@c is asking|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Seems that both teams may be playing similar systems as they are replicating this bidding in Open|pg||
pc|sA|nt|gulyas: I guess it didn't:)|pg||
pc|s9|nt|garnetts: Nothing else to do actually--but he found it|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|elbec: 3@d is without singletons|pg||
pc|c2|nt|nulda: probably slam trying :)|pg||
nt|chick: but it also cuts off communication for the heart ruff|pg||
nt|elbec: 3nt is even number of aces|pg||
nt|vugraphzur: 2n 15+ 6@H or 5332|pg||
nt|vugraphzur: 3n 5332|pg||
nt|vugraphzur: 3@D no sing|pg||
nt|elbec: ok so I have not the updated release of their system :)|pg||
pc|c6|nt|andyv:  a big pick up for Blue as OR stopped at 3@c|pg||
nt|gulyas: 7 IMPs to the US team instead of 5 the other way|pg||
nt|gulyas: the Greeks cannot afford too many mistakes like this|pg||
nt|andyv:  the lead is tough and K@d was the only entry to S's hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  as one spec points out, the contracted was also right sided|pg||
nt|andyv:  contract|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Correction, on 17 S pulled the double of 4@H to 4@S also doubled and no improvement|pg||
pc|cA|nt|gulyas: good save there|pg||
nt|garnetts: that is very poor play |pg||
nt|gulyas: N can still work this out|pg||
nt|gulyas: take it and play a @C|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|garnetts: but North might save the day |pg||
nt|marlowepi: the weak 2 left the stroing hand in passout seat, and this made it unlikely that EW would reach the slam--the 3S bid by E was very aggressive. in contrast, multi allowed the strong ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hand to double directly, so now 3S by E was much easier. something to think about|pg||
mc|11|nt|cherdano:  that would be a little aggressive :) |pg||
pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|nulda: 1d natural or 15-17 NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N!|nt|nulda: 3NT probably|pg||
nt|nulda: should be made on diamond finesses|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C!|nt|elbec: not if he plays ace and king like it happens in closed room|pg||
nt|nulda: 2NT probably asking for spade support|pg||
nt|nulda: 3c denies|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|jstokes: for many 2NT is potentially a weak hand and 3@H here is not forcing -- not sure how they play|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c3|pc|c7|nt|nulda: not a happy contract |pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|pg||

nt|nulda: yes|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cQ|nt|mildredb: hi, Henri :)|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c9|pg||
nt|ritong: 3NT has excellent chances with this layout, tho|pg||
nt|thenapster: hello everybody|pg||
nt|ritong: say a relatively natural @c lead, declarer has few options|pg||
nt|elbec: now he can make it on a ruff ruff play|pg||
nt|nulda: GIB says its makable now|pg||
nt|mildredb: kibs saying they think it can make, seems to me that declarer will have to go -1|pg||
nt|ritong: but east found a devilish @h lead other room|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cJ|nt|nulda: even after a trump now?|pg||
pc|c5|pc|s8|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|pc|dK|pc|d4|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sT|nt|jstokes: could take 1@C, 1@S, 2@D and 6 trumps (ruffing spades high)|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|mildredb: should make now :)|pg||
pc|h9|nt|nulda: yes one spade, one diamond and 6 spades on cross ruffs|pg||
nt|mildredb: win @H in dummy - cash @S and then @D to A and high crossruff|pg||
nt|nulda: 6 tricks on cross ruffs |pg||
pc|h3|nt|jstokes: got it right|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hT|pg||
nt|mildredb: must cash @S|pg||
nt|nulda: must take Q of spades now|pg||

pg||

nt|cherdano:  btw, the swing on board 1 was caused by East's action over 1@S - he overcalled 1NT in the other room|pg||
nt|chick: lots of good inferences to make ... well done!|pg||
nt|santyclz: This looks like fun.|pg||
nt|gulyas: since he decided to overcall with that pile, at least he should have known that THAT suit is well stopped|pg||
nt|gulyas: oh well|pg||
nt|gulyas: 11 tricks is not likely, was it not 10?|pg||
nt|don paulus: other room was @s lead|pg||
nt|marlowepi: both six clubs and four hearts are also flaws, but the worst is too much defense ESPECIALLY at favorable vul where pd will be MOST likely to save|pg||
nt|chick: lucky it made, lucky E had a @S stopper|pg||
mb|1D|nt|cherdano:  which looks very reasonable to me|pg||
nt|nulda: they play 1@h 14-20 5+|pg||
nt|vugraphzur: sorry all connection problem|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: we always have some wood in stock:)|pg||
nt|gulyas: EW can make 4@S|pg||
nt|chick: now there's one convention I really dislike|pg||
nt|gulyas: NS can save in 5@D, going for 300|pg||
nt|santyclz: 5@d?|pg||
nt|andyv:  6@C, 2@S, 2@h and 1@D|pg||
nt|garnetts: The same lead in the OR but South returned a club and failed to lead a third round|pg||
nt|elbec: 1nt is 12-14|pg||
nt|elbec: 1@c is 15/17 balanced, 15+ with 4+@c or any GF|pg||
nt|mcarroll: And one trick seems to have goten lost - only 1 down|pg||
mb|1S|nt|gulyas: oh, ok, sry|pg||
nt|elbec: 1@h is 4+@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Best kind of sac.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@H presumably hearts and a minor|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so 4NT for the minor|pg||
nt|gulyas: 4@S just makes|pg||
nt|gulyas: and so does 5@C:)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it looks as if it takes a diamond lead to beat 6@C|pg||
nt|gulyas: ouch|pg||
nt|elbec: would have you passed with west hand?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: gotten|pg||
mb|2H|nt|cherdano:  so maybe North is tempted to bid more than 3@H here?|pg||
nt|gulyas: these teams are currently 8th and 6th, respectively, so they are both in the heat of qualifying (top8 Qs)|pg||
nt|andyv:  W felt he had to do something but 5 card minor suit overcalls at 2 level rarely gain anything|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: 5@D would be sensible, it is almost certain that EW has a Vul game, and this will go for 300 max|pg||
nt|gulyas: this is when u gently lean over and ask 'no more @Cs, partner?':)|pg||
nt|garnetts: 2@S is very agressive--prefer double to show spades with at least tolerance for clubs|pg||
nt|don paulus: hard to stay out of game - all key cards wrong|pg||
nt|april7: might end up in 3NT perhaps making with double finesse in @D|pg||
mb|2S|nt|gulyas: this is where your wk2 should show the best hand: 2nd seat, vul against not|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: I guess NS should sacrifice, all the way to 6@S:)|pg||
nt|april7: another 3NT but a litle more tricky|pg||
nt|gulyas: so even a 7 card suit is acceptable here |pg||
nt|cindy:  hi all|pg||
nt|jstokes: Hi Cindy|pg||
nt|gulyas: hi Cindy|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure I want to be in 3 nt |pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3N down i think|pg||
nt|april7: 26points though|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 5 tricks on club lead|pg||
nt|april7: with double finesse in @D and @C lead 9 tricks available|pg||
mb|3D|nt|gulyas: N, with no defense whatsoever outside @Ss could go to 5@S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East will lead a club, surely....and be somewhat narked by the outcome|pg||
nt|april7: now its easier again for N|pg||
nt|gulyas: now he has 9 tricks|pg||
nt|gulyas: his suit lacks the intermediates, so its a soso overcall (with a passed pd, I would pass)|pg||
mb|p|nt|nulda: in CR 4spades made from EW|pg||
nt|gulyas: yes, the so-called snapdragon double|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Probably not - basically I think the quicker you can interfere with conventional opening bids the better|pg||
nt|elbec: 2nt is the balanced hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you have to lose a diamond, which gives them five tricks on club lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: the screeching of brakes......|pg||
mb|3H|nt|april7: I think N has still to find J of @S|pg||
nt|gulyas: 4@H makes here too |pg||
nt|garnetts: They may well have this sorted but I would certainly have bid 4@S as East if my partner had bid 2@S|pg||
nt|elbec: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: 3@C,3@D,2@H,1@S should be enough:)|pg||
nt|elbec: and defence is quite easy|pg||
nt|elbec: but 2nt is quite an awful contract|pg||
mb|3S|nt|april7: he can finesse J of @C|pg||
nt|gulyas: same contract in the OR|pg||
nt|andyv:  in mp I might bid the hand... I just don't see it's value in imps esp. when vul|pg||
nt|gulyas: vul against not is very dangerous|pg||
nt|elbec: even if playing doubledummy with this lead|pg||
nt|elbec: he can make 10 tricks!!!|pg||
nt|april7: only 4 on @C lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: 4@S would have been 500, so it was a good call to let it go|pg||
nt|ady: 2nd bids of both appear shortages|pg||
mb|3N|nt|santyclz: I'm conflicted about that, n having limited his hand with 1nt should usually leave such descisions to his pd, but this may be an exception.|pg||
nt|gulyas: E will take his 4 tops, thank you very much, and folds up soon after|pg||
nt|chick: must cash all tricks right now|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes - Koike's partner may mention to him that one of the rteasons to overcall is to indicate a lead to pd|pg||
nt|april7: 3 @C and ace of @S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if you time the play right & make the right choices. but if you go all out for Ds the opps have 5 tricks|pg||
nt|april7: you don't lose a @D|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: E might develop10th trick by playing @S|pg||
nt|april7: but E will probably lead @D now|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: not necessarily, can finesse @D twice, for 1 club, 5 diamonds, 4 hearts ... and defense can take 3 clubs and the @SA|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherdano:  maybe North could have raised to 3@H right away|pg||
nt|mdgraham: @DJ looked a bit safer|pg||
nt|mcarroll: or transfers?|pg||
nt|vugraphzur: franchý's 2@C gf any others is relay|pg||
nt|ady: heart lead best    but should still make|pg||
pc|h9|nt|nulda: W a bit two strong for 2s I suppose, 1s would be better|pg||
nt|cherdano:  to allow partner to bid 4 with extras|pg||
nt|santyclz: Unlucky might very well get out for -1 if played by s.|pg||
nt|frankaus: now 10 looks to be making|pg||
nt|ady: now easy 9 tricks     maybe 10|pg||
nt|april7: I said double finesse in @D|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i must have misunderstood the previous ramarks--i thought the suggestion was that declarer get 4 tricks from Ds|pg||
pc|hA|nt|gulyas: E could have saved the day with a NF 2@H, but it could be wrong on other hands|pg||
pc|h6|nt|andyv:  W will do well to go -2 on this|pg||
nt|elbec: he doesn't want to play @h|pg||
nt|mcarroll: again unanimity|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|cherdano:  yes the heavy jump caused EW to miss game here|pg||
nt|andyv:  dbl dummy, W cashes one more @S, switches to @h, and after 3 rounds, then leads @s|pg||
pc|dA|nt|gulyas: nice suit pref by discarding the @HJ|pg||
nt|chick: true, but wasn't much other choice anyway :)|pg||
nt|elbec: 1 off|pg||
pc|d4|nt|jstokes: friendly club position prevents any problems for declarer here|pg||
pc|d2|nt|gulyas: yes, thats what I meant|pg||
nt|andyv:  good switch|pg||
nt|chick: harder now, because they didn't give him a club trick|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|dK|nt|gulyas: so Bob knew he could not open up a trick in @Cs|pg||
nt|gulyas: N could have had @CA and @SK in theory|pg||
nt|gulyas: and pd with @CKT|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d6|nt|cherdano:  Ozgur, was 2@S explained as weak?|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|dT|pc|h2|nt|mcarroll: But as he only has a single @H that only postpones making a favourable lead for decaler|pg||
pc|s4|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c6|nt|marlowepi: and my poin was that declarer does not get 5 diamonds, or even 4 without creating fifth trick for defense|pg||
pc|cT|nt|gulyas: now @H ruff, and then the @S to promote another trump trick|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes|pg||
nt|andyv:  good d|pg||
nt|garnetts: It is 500 but not clear cut to double perhaps --can be a useful investment for a couple of imps if they go on and go off|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|april7: now its down ofcourse|pg||
pc|hT|nt|nulda: 13 IMPs for NS|pg||
nt|vugraphzur: yes 2@s was weak|pg||
nt|cherdano:  yes a big swing to the Japanese-Czech team|pg||
pc|s7|pc|h3|pc|h4|pg||
nt|don paulus: flat board|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|gulyas: that could have been possible|pg||
pc|s2|pc|hK|pc|h5|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h8|pc|s5|nt|april7: on @C lead declarer could have made 1 @S,4@H 3@D and 1 @C trick|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|andyv:  a push |pg||
nt|gulyas: so, the same defense, the same result here|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sT|nt|ady: now 9   another diamond|pg||

mb|2S!|mb|d|nt|brolucius: Un peu en retard, Henri...|pg||
nt|ritong: aucun probleme:)|pg||
nt|thenapster: 2d its either hearts or either diamonds and GF|pg||
mb|p!|nt|elbec: 2@s is 6+@h or 5332 or 5+@h 4+@c|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Very racy 1@S overcall at the other table. Not really recommended when you are taking away no bidding space.|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|elbec: 2nt was either 6+@h or 5332|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mildredb: should be a few imp p/u for ItalyRed|pg||
nt|thenapster: can take 1 imps here|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer can finesse diamonds into the safe hand, who cannot effectively play clubs.|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s8|pc|sQ|pg||

pc|s4|pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s9|pg||
mc|10|nt|ritong: so 19 imps with 12 boards to go  anything can happen|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3NT was OK on a club lead because the @CK would have been the 9th trick.|pg||
nt|vugraphzuq: Kopecky is calling TD|pg||
nt|brolucius: After a club lead, you would test the hearts, falling back on the diamond suit if hearts did not produce 6 tricks.|pg||
nt|elbec: i can't wait to watch next hand|pg||
nt|elbec: it looks like 5@s can be made...|pg||
nt|brolucius: Perhaps you will have to.|pg||
nt|vugraphzuq: Di franco alerted 2Nt: 5@h+4@c|pg||
nt|brolucius: So, North is claiming he would otherwise have led a club, presumably.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Well, it only makes a difference of 1 overtrick.|pg||
pg||

nt|chick: you're right, I was thinking N was the dummy :)|pg||
nt|gulyas: but with @S KQx, S was going to double|pg||
nt|elbec: let's see what happens now|pg||
nt|elbec: it looks like a very tight match since the beginning|pg||
nt|elbec: @h game for ew here|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 3NT by S in Open so @H lead more likely and may not make|pg||
mb|1H|nt|cherdano:  which is, as far as i know, the only transnational team in this transnational youth Championship|pg||
nt|cherdano:  Now that is an ugly 11 count|pg||
nt|cherdano:  in the North hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzur: ducked the d|pg||
nt|santyclz: True there wasn't much choice, but making pd figure something out when you know the answer and can tell him is an *error*.|pg||
nt|chick: Right on, Joe :)|pg||
nt|elbec: ew make 4@s|pg||
nt|elbec: but it's very hard|pg||
nt|frankaus: easy 3nt game here |pg||
mb|1S|mb|2C!|nt|april7: a @H partscore for EW,2@H and 3@D for NS|pg||
nt|gulyas: a really ugly 11 count, I am surprised W did not open:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: splinter|pg||
nt|don paulus: not many entries in E|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes plenty of tricks but missing 2 Aces|pg||
nt|frankaus: will Paparo seach for slam?|pg||
nt|april7: 4@H or even 3NT by EW|pg||
nt|april7: W will now id 2 @H and E will give him the 4th|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: I noticed that, just didn't know why|pg||
nt|andyv:  3N seems the likely spot|pg||
nt|jstokes: both Norths open, which gets them to the good game|pg||
nt|elbec: ok 1@s is better :)|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|mdgraham: we have seen worse openings|pg||
nt|gulyas: agree|pg||
nt|ady: 10 likely tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: so 2 @D= what? |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: better hand than 2 @H?|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|nulda: 1d 11-20 nat or 15-17 bal|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good morning to Oliver Clarke|pg||
nt|gulyas: finally a boring hand in 3NT:)|pg||
nt|chick: made even more boring by the lead :)|pg||
nt|gulyas: yes, 3NT it should be|pg||
mb|p|nt|nulda: why not 1h?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: good lawfuls|pg||
nt|mdgraham: sorry, good lawful 4@D raise|pg||
nt|gulyas: 3@S showing @S stop here|pg||
nt|garnetts: Almost certainly but will not always be the case --|pg||
mb|2N|nt|oliverc: Good morning everyone|pg||
nt|gulyas: I don't know how 2@H would have fared...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i would open too, but if they pass it is still 100% to get there|pg||
nt|mcarroll: They are in 3NT in Open - which should also make - @D finesse helps of course|pg||
mb|p|nt|jstokes: yes, with such a good fit, i agree|pg||
mb|3N|nt|cherdano:  i am corrected - team 42 also is transnational, with 4 different nationalities|pg||
nt|nulda: do not give an invitation to Macura, I know|pg||
nt|gulyas: a very disciplined pass by E on the 16 cound|pg||
nt|gulyas: *count|pg||
nt|elbec: interesting bidding|pg||
nt|elbec: 1nt could be any GF|pg||
nt|elbec: but I dont' know|pg||
nt|elbec: 2@c asks|pg||
nt|frankaus: 3@S now slam try|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherdano:  I kind of like 2NT|pg||
nt|cherdano:  with all those queens|pg||
nt|cherdano:  NT may well play better than hearts|pg||
nt|oliverc: well this contract will get everything it deserves|pg||
nt|gulyas: lead a trump and watch it fall apart|pg||
nt|april7: @H lead is best and E will go 2 down|pg||
nt|gulyas: asking for pd to bid 3NT with a @D stop|pg||
nt|andyv:  question of how to play the @CS... cash Ace first or dbl hook?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: probably making - can engineer a club ruff in the West hand|pg||
nt|april7: then only 1 down, but canot make it|pg||
nt|gulyas: cashing the A is the safety play|pg||
nt|andyv:  this takes all the pressure off|pg||
nt|don paulus: @s for @h ?|pg||
nt|don paulus: 6 @s|pg||
nt|elbec: 2@h 5+@h|pg||
nt|ady: speedy 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: really bad hand W has|pg||
nt|mdgraham: trump lead often best on these types of auction |pg||
nt|gulyas: as long as he doesn't put up the @CJ but ruffs out the Q, he can get home in 2@H (no trump lead)|pg||
nt|april7: but he is in 3@H|pg||
nt|gulyas: that will not make|pg||
nt|gulyas: the only excitement would have come from playing in 4@S, but that would have made as well|pg||
nt|andyv:  S might have dbld 3@s to suggest lead but his @Ss weren't terrific.|pg||
nt|sybarra: a bit scary given the club stopper |pg||
nt|vugraphzur: 2@D: 5+ @D or @D values with @H support|pg||
pc|c9|nt|elbec: 4@d should be @h fixed and cue-bid in @d (and not in @c, and maybe also not in @s)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: looks like this will result in tying the match at 2 all|pg||
nt|frankaus: hard to stop - 5@S - 5NT?|pg||
nt|ady: 5NT  may have difficulty|pg||
nt|april7: on a @C lead W has to run home|pg||
pc|cK|nt|gulyas: don't see why he should bid 1@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzur: 2@C no 5m no 4@H no good 6@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzur: 2@H trs to 2@S|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Depends on NS getting their 2@S tricks|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|gulyas: the good news is, now declarer has 8 tricks|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|gulyas: he should have let the opps venture into 3-4@S and go down|pg||
nt|santyclz: It wouldn't have occurred to me.  1@s would have, but I would have resisted.|pg||
nt|gulyas: other room, a huge result for Australia|pg||
nt|gulyas: especially since 3@D is not making|pg||
nt|santyclz: Lead can't be right, that's what I would have led.|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|garnetts: Yes--might have doubled 2@H to suggest a TOD without spades maybe--but very disciplined --K@D looks better to me |pg||
nt|gulyas: the bad news is, there will be no more|pg||
pc|h8|nt|mdgraham: not the best of starts for the defence|pg||
nt|april7: but without a X its 2 imps save|pg||
nt|chick: lol|pg||
nt|gulyas: most ppl would have tried 1NT or 2@C there|pg||
pc|h3|nt|gulyas: so a doubled overtrick is unexpected:)|pg||
nt|gulyas: over 1@H|pg||
nt|frankaus: dell done in the bidding - it should get home|pg||
nt|frankaus: not east tho|pg||
nt|ady: yes   8 major suit tricks    can devlop 3 minor suit tricks|pg||
nt|frankaus: 4@S 4@H 2@D 1@C|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yep|pg||
nt|ady: have to take care  not to cash hearts too quickly  as east has 5 hearts|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|sybarra: and dashing now |pg||
pc|hT|pc|hJ|pc|hA|nt|frankaus: surely will try @D first in case they are 3-3|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|gulyas: I would have led a @H, but that still would not have helped:)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|gulyas: but with only a half stopper, and a really crummy 5c suit, I agree with the pass|pg||
pc|h9|nt|santyclz: I'm of the old school that if an overcall doesn't take away any space it should be on full values.  The more space it takes away the less solid it has to be.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I suspect that the double of 3@D was intended as take-out |pg||
nt|andyv:  claim time|pg||
nt|gulyas: long, bad @Ss|pg||
pc|c7|nt|nulda: two down probably and 6 IMPs back to the Netherlands|pg||
nt|ady: clubs 5-1 also is good for declarer  as defence cant taked 2 clubs and 1 diamond on a club lead|pg||
nt|frankaus: some communication prob if not careful|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|h7|pc|s5|nt|ady: only worry  is if east has A109X of diamonds and ace of clubs|pg||
nt|ady: 10@D  from west good news|pg||
pc|s7|nt|cherdano:  although given the NS agreements, i dont think it is so attractive - opposite 15-17 balanced you will get to game anyway, and opposite an unbalanced hand diamonds or hearts may still play better|pg||
nt|mcarroll: E has no good return|pg||
nt|ady: heart is the most awkard    but contract has to make as they lay|pg||
nt|mcarroll: At least this is letting the Open Room catch up|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|april7: W might make so experiments now trying to endplay N|pg||
pc|h5|nt|gulyas: probably|pg||
nt|garnetts: WEell 2@C is dreadful in my view--1NT has all of the wrong feel too--this east looks like a well coached player to me|pg||
pc|s2|nt|gulyas: one trick running away here too? no|pg||
nt|vugraphzur: sorry not 2@D 2@C is|pg||
pc|d3|nt|gulyas: 2 down, and 12 IMPs to Australia|pg||
nt|elbec: if di franco ducks the diamonds, they're going to make only 11 tricks|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|d2|nt|elbec: first duck|pg||
pc|d8|nt|april7: now they lose 4imps|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d9|pg||
nt|oliverc: I can't see any reason NOT to bid 1@H over 1@D|pg||
nt|oliverc: and I can't see ANY reason to bid 3NT over 2NT :)|pg||
nt|nulda: as I said, do not give an invitation do Milan Macura, you can bid a game itself instead|pg||
nt|cherdano:  yes the south hand looked good UNTIL partner suggested NT|pg||
nt|cherdano:  as long as East keeps his club here he is fine|pg||
pc|s9|nt|cherdano:  but of course he should pitch a heart to beat the contract two tricks|pg||
pc|dT|nt|gulyas: both are having problems there, agree|pg||
nt|elbec: well done|pg||
nt|frankaus: claim|pg||
pc|sA|nt|oliverc: jeepers|pg||
nt|ady: now no problem|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|april7: no experiments|pg||
pc|h4|nt|nulda: oh a trick escaped for the defense now|pg||
nt|frankaus: lucky to get out that sticky spot|pg||
mc|9|nt|gulyas: still, 2 IMPs to France who went to 3@S and made an overtrick with some help|pg||
pg||

nt|jstokes: easy to see how they might be confused by the 2NT bid, since it was available only because of north's double|pg||
mb|1H|mb|1S|mb|4H|mb|4S|nt|elbec: their cc says that 2nt shows 6+@h or 5332|pg||
nt|jstokes: but that must be 2NT instead of 2@S|pg||
nt|brolucius: On the face of it, 5@S should have been OK.|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Perhaps someone can look at MOVIE and tell us how they went down at the other table.|pg||
nt|ritong: we miss a pass|pg||
nt|elbec: he played @d to the king|pg||
nt|ritong: huseyin?|pg||
nt|thenapster: west trying to play on AX daimond on north|pg||
mb|5S|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|elbec: same bidding|pg||
nt|thenapster: trying to play J to the K,playing the clubs and after that diamond for ruff and discard|pg||
pc|c8|nt|brolucius: He would have been a hero if it had worked. How unlucky...|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ritong: north will play this for a singleton|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cK|pc|c9|pc|c6|pg||
nt|ritong: so the contract basically relies on @d hook|pg||
nt|thenapster: i guess that Di franco going to play the same way like in the CR|pg||
nt|brolucius: I don't expect so.|pg||
nt|elbec: I guess he will easily finesse the q@d|pg||
nt|thenapster: me too,but this is my feeling|pg||
nt|brolucius: North might hold @DA-Q-x, for one thing.|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s5|pc|sK|pc|s2|pg||
nt|elbec: even because somebody holding Ax plays the ace on the jack...|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|h5|nt|ritong: yes, so he played for Qx with south|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|c5|pc|h2|pc|cJ|pc|c3|pg||
nt|thenapster: true,my fault|pg||
nt|ritong: as david said, a bit trying to become a hero|pg||
nt|elbec: finesse....|pg||
nt|brolucius: If North held @DA-x, he would have the opprtunity to unblock it on the first round, so you should not play him for that holding when he plays low.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mildredb: he'll play @S to hand , cash @C and ruff @H & then decide|pg||
nt|ritong: although Axx works|pg||
pc|h4|pc|s7|pc|h6|pg||
pc|c7|pc|hT|pc|d4|pc|c4|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hJ|pc|s6|pc|h7|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d2|nt|ritong: drumroll|pg||
nt|brolucius: A clear mistake to rise with the king, as I see it.|pg||
nt|thenapster: now he must play small,he knows north have 1sp and 4clubs|pg||
nt|ritong: if we assume north had 6 @hs, you are right D|pg||
nt|thenapster: if he have 5 heart south have 7|pg||
pc|dK|nt|brolucius: It is easy for players of this standard to unblock from @DA-x as North. He has a count on the hand.|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d7|pc|dQ|pc|d3|pg||
mc|10|nt|thenapster: but when i feel something,i know|pg||

nt|mdgraham: two solid suits|pg||
nt|gulyas: oh-oh, disaster struck on the prev board in the OR|pg||
nt|andyv:  in OR, E was declarer and S had no trouble finding @S lead|pg||
nt|gulyas: E did overcall 1NT in the OR|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Oliver Clarke|pg||
nt|gulyas: hello Oliver|pg||
nt|garnetts: Hi Oliver |pg||
nt|oliverc: hi everyone|pg||
nt|elbec: still 1-0 after 4 boards|pg||
nt|ady: east likely rto open|pg||
nt|chick: counting to 13 is overrated ... I like a partner who can count to 9 :)|pg||
nt|april7: in pairs 4@H are better  though|pg||
mb|1H|nt|nulda: so how good is not to tell your 4 card major|pg||
mb|1S|nt|april7: 4@S just making,5@C on trump lead 1 down|pg||
nt|april7: in 4@S E must find the J of @H though|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South can get two ruffs, though|pg||
nt|april7: only 1|pg||
nt|gulyas: I would ruff out @Ds and make 5@C|pg||
nt|gulyas: they went to 6@D, which would not have been too bad, but then REDOUBLED!|pg||
nt|garnetts: North got in first lol|pg||
nt|garnetts: 3@S look OK to me as South to keep hearts out|pg||
nt|jstokes: and here we have the worst possible 8-card suit|pg||
nt|jstokes: how many diamonds from west?|pg||
nt|april7: might go up to the 5 level|pg||
mb|4H|nt|cherdano:  2@H probably shows 6 spades|pg||
nt|nulda: 1c 18-20 bal or 11+nat or 21+ anything|pg||
nt|oliverc: Well if EW are defending that poorly, South's decision to raise to game fully|pg||
nt|oliverc: justified, I suppose|pg||
nt|nulda: yes they play transfers in competitive bidding|pg||
nt|sybarra: but we are playing teams so make the contract |pg||
mb|4S|nt|cherdano:  NS in the other room got pushed to 5@S|pg||
nt|cherdano:  after East jump-overcalled 2@H|pg||
nt|nulda: probably 4h from N|pg||
nt|mdgraham: @DA, @D ruff, @HA, @D ruff|pg||
nt|gulyas: you have the @C8 as an entry too:)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but possibly academic as South might lead a top club against 4@S, if he let EW play it there|pg||
nt|april7: y 5@C can be made|pg||
nt|andyv:  N taking a very conservative approach with his hand|pg||
nt|oliverc: yes|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he almost has din just in one suit|pg||
nt|marlowepi: gin|pg||
nt|jstokes: and 4 great poker hands|pg||
nt|marlowepi: three seems like an odd number of diamonds to bid|pg||
nt|elbec: i agree. |pg||
nt|elbec: another good result from italy|pg||
nt|ady: 1NT?|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|april7: so 5@S is a good save|pg||
nt|gulyas: now, that was 1000 away|pg||
nt|gulyas: his @S suit is really bad quality|pg||
nt|gulyas: but overall, a nice hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes, but rest of hand quite excellent for 2@s opener|pg||
nt|gulyas: both 4@H and 4@S has merit, but they are not making on the actual layout |pg||
nt|garnetts: I wonder what the double of 2NT meant|pg||
nt|gulyas: but NS has to find the immediate @C ruff to beat it|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not at all clear to bid if you ask me |pg||
nt|gulyas: and EW needs the @D ruff to beat 4@S, more or less|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it does provide for E having a big onesuiter of his own, but then W hand is not likely to be too useful|pg||
nt|jstokes: he may be worried that partner has a big one-suiter (and therefore, possibly short diamonds)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: see my last remark|pg||
nt|elbec: in open room|pg||
nt|rgdruru: they can make 7nt|pg||
nt|ady: n/s may end in 2@S|pg||
nt|frankaus: clear opening IMO 28 zars|pg||
nt|april7: 6@H good save against 5 @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: and 12 to CKIS |pg||
mb|5S|nt|nulda: another chance for NS to stop in game|pg||
nt|gulyas: 5@C a real sacrifice this time|pg||
nt|chick: sad|pg||
nt|gulyas: an agressive t/o dbl over 2NT I would think|pg||
nt|gulyas: found the right hand with pd|pg||
nt|mcarroll: It will be interesting to see how the bidding develops here|pg||
mb|d|nt|oliverc: ...and will probably make 11 tricks, too, just to rub salt in the wounds|pg||
nt|nulda: 5s from N hand should be make|pg||
nt|cherdano:  North decided 4@S was enough - with the added benefit of protecting his @HAQ on the lead|pg||
nt|gulyas: if he had a decent @S suit (say, KT98 instead of K765), I would agree|pg||
nt|elbec: in open room bidding wasn't "world class"|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: 5@S makes on the trump finesse|pg||
nt|gulyas: I wonder if this is a lighter double here|pg||
nt|gulyas: I am sure he would like it to be:)|pg||
nt|oliverc: that would make sense|pg||
nt|elbec: nice contract bid (and doubled) here|pg||
nt|elbec: 4nt was ace asking for west and quantitative for east|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|gulyas: 5@Cx will go 2 down most likely|pg||
nt|gulyas: unless N decides to do something foolish:)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: nice 5@C bid|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 5@S is not a good save. 800 on best defence|pg||
nt|gulyas: N thought S had a great hand, whereas he was just running with his 7 carder and nothing else|pg||
nt|elbec: it's true|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think will be up to N given the stiff @S in that hand |pg||
pc|c9|nt|santyclz: Lawful 20 tricks?|pg||
nt|vugraphzur: franchý called director|pg||
nt|gulyas: S was not so sure, so he pulled |pg||
nt|garnetts: Can hardly be anyhting else--you know this 2NT bid led to this--why bother with it |pg||
nt|gulyas: N could think that after 2NT, this is a forcing situation|pg||
nt|oliverc: muddying the waters, perhaps|pg||
nt|gulyas: so then x is just weakness|pg||
nt|gulyas: but S could clearly see that N is probably very short in @Cs|pg||
nt|april7: this will be a disapointment|pg||
pc|c2|nt|andyv:  and another imp for the Greek team|pg||
nt|gulyas: actually 6@D is not a bad contract from the right side|pg||
nt|andyv:  can't get rid of the clubs|pg||
nt|gulyas: discard it on the @Hs|pg||
nt|andyv:  now he can|pg||
nt|gulyas: we will see if 4@S will be beat|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i am not keen on the double without a trump trick and without an expectation that 4H would make|pg||
nt|elbec: I don't know ew bidding system... maybe koike knows that his pard has a 3343 and it takes the right decision to bid only 6nt|pg||
nt|mcarroll: with a 20 count opposite an opening bid, 6NT seems a bit unilateral to me - giving up on investigating the grand|pg||
nt|elbec: 24|pg||
nt|elbec: count|pg||
nt|sybarra: for N/S  yes|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mcarroll: sorry misklik|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|nulda: in CR 5s was played from S hand, so one down|pg||
nt|gulyas: now overtake with the A, return a @S...|pg||
nt|gulyas: double fit is always extra|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South can't know that North has six diamonds, but overtaking was possible. Not likely to lead from Kx against this auction |pg||
nt|andyv:  yes, had to open my eyes:)|pg||
nt|rgdruru: 6@h for meckstroth i think|pg||
pc|cT|nt|vugraphzur: litte break|pg||
nt|cherdano:  probably a good idea for EW|pg||
nt|cherdano:  of course EW don't take any blame for the loss on this board - their teammates taking the push to 5@S was the costly decision|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c8|nt|chick: I say never redouble a slam.  (unless you have 13 spades)  The opponents are nuts to double unless they have something you don't expect (and I never assume the opps are nuts) :)|pg||
nt|ritong: at least they know who will offer the drinks when they are qualified|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|gulyas: as long as N doesn't want to play a hero, they will have their 4 tricks|pg||
nt|gulyas: oops|pg||
nt|chick: Hi Henri :)|pg||
nt|ritong: :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Salut Henri.|pg||
nt|gulyas: that helps:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  so it's a push|pg||
nt|oliverc: Franchi may well not find the Diamond lead, but Paparo should surely find the switch|pg||
nt|oliverc: at trick 3|pg||
pc|s7|nt|april7: I meant 5@H|pg||
nt|gulyas: 800 doesn't sound like a good save:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  almost 1am here:)|pg||
nt|gulyas: oh:)|pg||
nt|gulyas: well, with trumps 3-0, he may not be able to take all the tricks he wants|pg||
nt|gulyas: has to take the @S finesse as well|pg||
nt|gulyas: 2dik|pg||
nt|andyv:  he should be ok...@s hook is marked and even if it loses no problem|pg||
nt|gulyas: oops, sry|pg||
nt|gulyas: right|pg||
pc|s5|nt|Walddk5: http://psbridge.gotdns.com/bbo/allvug/  - Vugraph Hand Records (PDF)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|gulyas: well, sometimes they ARE nuts and you have to punish them, but it is not too often|pg||
nt|oliverc: wd|pg||
nt|elbec: best lead for manno|pg||
nt|don paulus: will be a relief to see stiff K @h|pg||
nt|elbec: rodrigo what is the best line in your opinion?|pg||
nt|murat e: declarer worried now but soon he will be happy unless he plays heart jack from dummy|pg||
nt|elbec: not if he plays jack of hearts :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Not unreasonable to play East for K10x|pg||
nt|don paulus: well ... if he does not have the 10 ...|pg||
nt|elbec: but he should start with 9 of @h|pg||
nt|Walddk4: who would cover that from K10x?|pg||
nt|elbec: nobody|pg||
nt|elbec: but it would be a nice move|pg||
nt|elbec: to play king with k10x|pg||
nt|elbec: delete my last sentence|pg||
nt|elbec: :)|pg||
nt|elbec: too hot here :D|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Try F6|pg||
nt|elbec: :)|pg||
nt|elbec: nice|pg||
nt|Walddk4: then you get a blank screen|pg||
nt|unclejohn: if he's SURE @CK offside, the !A, @H to Q, hope for @HK onside and either friendly @Hs or 3-3 @S and 4-3 @S|pg||
nt|unclejohn: @HA|pg||
nt|murat e: practically club finesse is useless w not expected to underlead fm king of clubs to the strong hand|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome Bart Bramley|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ady: will hold to 8 tricks now|pg||
pc|h7|nt|gulyas: that was silly|pg||
nt|gulyas: right, he can see pd has 1 @D max|pg||
nt|cindy:  no and they would have been in real trouble if it gets sent back|pg||
pc|sA|nt|marlowepi: it is true that it rates to go down, but 300 is not going to happen all that often, and 100 is not worth much versus 50|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|chick: lol kibs are saying it's no fun unless you punish the double :)|pg||
nt|oliverc: quite|pg||
nt|april7: W has no choice must finesse for Q of @D|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hT|pc|s6|nt|chick: it's 100% true, bridge is supposed to be fun :)|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|gulyas: once my pd redbled a slam to make me concentrate more on declarer play:) the opps led the suit that would set me, but then failed to cash their winner and I made with a squeeze:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i dont think N has a double, he had no assurance of making 5H and since it was he who bid it, not S, i dont exven think he should even have a particularly high expectation of ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: making it|pg||
nt|april7: in teamy 6 @H is a better bid, couldn't cost to much but X might be very expensive as we see|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|gulyas: he may even be able to crossruff his way home|pg||
nt|andyv:  he plans to xruff everything now|pg||
nt|oliverc: incisive defence, nicely done|pg||
pc|d2|nt|gulyas: so, yes, bridge can be fun a lot of times|pg||
nt|vugraphzur: fay claims before darkadakis play|pg||
nt|unclejohn: i mean 3-3@Ds and 4-3 @Ss, then can pitch both clubs|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i wouldnt do that either. it is not like either 5S or 6H rates to makes. S did not cuebid. 6H might go for 500 when 5S was failing. i would just pass and hope both sides can make ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: only 10 tricks|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
nt|gulyas: those @S tricks were not going anywhere|pg||
nt|garnetts: good 8@H to ask for a @D --but was perhqaps obvious |pg||

mb|p|nt|murat e: however it was north who bid 5 hearts|pg||
nt|thenapster: oh no,big problem|pg||
nt|ritong: ?|pg||
mb|5C|nt|brolucius: South will be lucky to find that 4@H went down, minimising his loss. |pg||
nt|jstokes: maybe not so big, given that 4@H went down in the other room|pg||
nt|ritong: spilled coffee ion your keyboard?|pg||
nt|nulda: they are not satisfied with 4|pg||
mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|thenapster: so Macura have to guess the hearts to make it|pg||
nt|brolucius: How else was North meant to bid a minimum raise to game?|pg||
nt|ritong: this is quite a bit of luck|pg||
nt|elbec: previous line in 5@s is winning if N has Axx. |pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, that's true. |pg||
nt|ritong: yes, we said that a year ago:) but does not fit with the bidding|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ritong: why would north bid 5@h with 5431?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer must aim to ditch two clubs and limit his losers to one in each red suit.|pg||

mb|p|nt|andyv:  a disaster in the OR on this board|pg||
nt|gulyas: a grand bid and made in the OR|pg||

nt|elbec: maybe only 14 :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: only 14, no squeeze|pg||
nt|cindy:  15 is something like 14 :)|pg||
nt|elbec: 12-14|pg||
nt|april7: Qx or Ax both would have worked if @C would have been eliminated first!!!|pg||
mb|1H|nt|oliverc: easy major suit game here|pg||
mb|1S|nt|santyclz: As Martin Johnson points out, though, a @h at the end would have saved a trick.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Istanbul.09/Asp/RoundTeams.asp?qtournid=724&qroundno=12  for standings after 12 rounds. Top 8 after this round advance to the quarter-finals ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: tomorrow|pg||
nt|andyv:  N tried to sign off in 3@d after a strong @c opener but S continued to 3N|pg||
nt|marlowepi: esp for 1NT|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|nulda: 2c both majors 44, 6-13 points|pg||
nt|andyv:  @d lead to prevent @c ruff|pg||
nt|gulyas: 1@D will not go 5 down, I am sure:)|pg||
nt|garnetts: can overbid it maybe|pg||
nt|oliverc: maybe they can get too high|pg||
nt|cindy:  yes :)|pg||
nt|don paulus: W pass or 2 nt ?|pg||
mb|2D|nt|nulda: 2d relay|pg||
nt|cherdano:  6-13, quite a wide range!|pg||
nt|andyv:  7 tricks in the bank now|pg||
nt|ady: 6@C   on trump finesse|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: two eminently sensible auctions|pg||
nt|elbec: other IMPS coimg for italy|pg||
mb|2S|nt|gulyas: both 2@H and 3@D makes|pg||
nt|april7: on a first round @H finesse S can make now 10 tricks|pg||
nt|marlowepi: would anyonbe open 2C with S hand? i would|pg||
nt|elbec: west was kind of shy here|pg||
mb|p|nt|nulda: 1st and 2nd hand a bit better (written in their CC)|pg||
nt|santyclz: A bad hand for the weak nt.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Istanbul.09/Asp/RoundTeams.asp?qtournid=724&qroundno=10  for standings after 10 rounds. First 8 after 13 rounds advance to the quarter-finals ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: tomorrow|pg||
nt|andyv:  and a new leader|pg||
nt|oliverc: plenty of scope for West to fall in love with their hand|pg||
nt|cindy:  not sure|pg||
nt|gulyas: its a great 22|pg||
nt|cindy:  it is true|pg||
nt|marlowepi: cant rebid satisfactorily after 1D|pg||
nt|cindy:  are they playing step responses ?|pg||
nt|jstokes: very hard to show the minors after a 2@C opening; great hand, though and will be hard to identify 13+ tricks after this start|pg||
nt|cindy:  no problem getting to 7 with 2@C and steps|pg||
nt|gulyas: if you play control responses, it takes 2 bids to get to grand:)|pg||
nt|cindy:  not sure you need to worry about the @c suit|pg||
nt|cindy:  yep|pg||
nt|marlowepi: its not the point count, its the fact that you can make 3N opposite many hands that will pass, and you cant rebid adequately after 1D|pg||
nt|cindy:  im sure now, marshall.  yes, just treating it as a one suiter|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i dont see the problem in showing the minors. 3D shows diamonds, and clubs are probably not important|pg||
nt|ady: I think will end in 5@C|pg||
mb|2N|nt|santyclz: The @d fit remained undisclosed.|pg||
nt|gulyas: this looks more like 8 tricks|pg||
nt|elbec: they should play inverted double...|pg||
mb|p|nt|elbec: what do you think about 4@d bid?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the case for 1D would be stronger if there were a way to rebid that put the minors in proper perspectiuve, but there isnt|pg||
nt|cindy:  i think it is fine|pg||
nt|cindy:  they are in a game force and 4@d describes hand imo|pg||
nt|unclejohn: in theory he's off only 2 trumps and 3 side aces, but there are just a few "handling charges" - down 2 more likely|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I agree|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mcarroll: Yes 6 more imps in|pg||
nt|elbec: let's see if he manages to make 8 tricks|pg||
nt|elbec: defence in open room wasn't perfect|pg||
mb|p|nt|nulda: 2s minimum, 5 cards|pg||
nt|andyv:  8 for sure, mayb be 9 with 2 spade pitches|pg||
nt|jstokes: what else other than 4@D|pg||
nt|elbec: here they are|pg||
nt|jstokes: here they are in slam, but grand seems difficult to me on this auction|pg||
nt|jstokes: unless Fay just bids it|pg||
nt|elbec: he will bid it|pg||
nt|elbec: he has lots of extra values|pg||
nt|elbec: all @d high trumps|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, i dont know about that "what else besides 4D?"  3N might be the last makeable game. N hasnt promised much at all at that point, and 3S just says "can u bid 3N?"|pg||
nt|elbec: kq of spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|murat e: interesting play 5 obvious tricks for the defence and sixth will come from somewhwer or not....|pg||
nt|elbec: let's see what happens|pg||
mb|p|nt|cherdano:  i am surprised North didnt try for game|pg||
nt|oliverc: ...and no fairytale if they do, since North has the wrong singleton @H honour|pg||
nt|elbec: i don't like 6nt here...|pg||
nt|cindy:  was 5N pick a slam ?|pg||
nt|jstokes: I assume it was pick a slam -- would he bid it with the queen of clubs instead of the king?|pg||
nt|elbec: 5nt asks for high trumps, Josephine style|pg||
pc|s3|nt|april7: 10 or 11 tricks if S finesses J of @H, because @D suit breaks well|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i wonder what 2S ver 1S would have mant?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|cherdano:  oh i see 2s showed a minimum|pg||
nt|gulyas: 4@D, 2@S, 2@C|pg||
nt|andyv:  yeap|pg||
nt|gulyas: they may get too high now|pg||
nt|oliverc: no. should stop there|pg||
nt|cindy:  i dont think so elbec|pg||
nt|gulyas: somebody should have blackwooded here...|pg||
nt|vugraphzur: 5nt was pick a slam|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N could easily have:  xxx   Axxxx   9x  Qxx. now 3N is stone cold but you have to guess to make 5C|pg||
nt|don paulus: interesting @d position|pg||
nt|ady: re-bid of 2@C alerted   did not show clubs   3@C next bid confirmed clubs|pg||
nt|frankaus: i think they are showing S's shape|pg||
pc|sT|nt|nulda: Michal has to have good brakes to stop in 2|pg||
nt|oliverc: (5@H)|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|gulyas: you should use the 6c keycard bw here|pg||
nt|oliverc: or 5@S|pg||
nt|garnetts: they must take the A@D |pg||
nt|frankaus: so 6@C would not supprise me|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this lead (the 3 spot) is a big comfort to S, who otherwise would have feared that 3 rounds of spades would not stand up|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dT|nt|oliverc: apparently 7@S in the other room|pg||
nt|gulyas: 7??|pg||
nt|oliverc: so I'm told|pg||
nt|garnetts: North may not see it that way|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d6|pg||
nt|gulyas: this is going down a lot now|pg||
nt|gulyas: I guess they don't use BW at all|pg||
nt|gulyas: well, with a @S lead, this is going down a lot|pg||
nt|garnetts: Hadn't noticed the South void--lightner comes into play|pg||
pc|d2|nt|gulyas: but it was brave from N to come in with that hand after 1NT|pg||
nt|unclejohn: i'm revising to down 1, and might actually make now with a winning @D guess|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|nulda: so another swing to Japan-Czech team, well done up to now|pg||
nt|gulyas: oh-oh|pg||
nt|garnetts: can switch to spades though--6@S |pg||
nt|gulyas: but didn't|pg||
nt|gulyas: now this will be 500|pg||
nt|oliverc: Any feelings on 6@H by East after West's sign-off?|pg||
nt|garnetts: Yes--crazy|pg||
nt|gulyas: agree:)|pg||
nt|gulyas: he just liked his 3 aces too much|pg||
nt|oliverc: unforgiveable, I feel|pg||
nt|frankaus: wd|pg||
nt|ady: have arrived|pg||
pc|dK|nt|gulyas: showing his A9xxx as a suit to play...|pg||
nt|gulyas: will N find the @S lead? should not be too hard|pg||
nt|gulyas: doh|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|gulyas: 6 more to Italy Red|pg||
pc|d9|nt|frankaus: all making slams are well bid :)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|cherdano:  West would have done better to start with the @DK, rather than a low @D|pg||
nt|gulyas: now the @DJ to ask for a @S?|pg||
nt|gulyas: hmm|pg||
nt|gulyas: well, still 2 down if he gets his ruff|pg||
nt|murat e: w must play ace and small club..|pg||
pc|d5|nt|unclejohn: that play should mark the red aces with east|pg||
nt|murat e: a cunning move to recover..|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|ady: if slam is not bid in OR  the position of K@C is around 26 imps swing|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the best plan is to play 3 rounds of diamonds planning to ruff in dummy, high if necessary. but that means EW can knock out club ace after first trump, which in turn means that S ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: will have to cash all the spades. if not for the lead, S would fear a six-card suit with W since he overcalled vul on a jack-high suit|pg||
nt|april7: S went for a bad solit in @D and wanted to ruff the 4th with 9 or 10 giving up 2@H and 1 @D|pg||
pc|c6|nt|unclejohn: east's @D shift strongly suggests his actual holding - why else break the suit?|pg||
nt|murat e: again it shows us that doubling opponents in two of a major is not reccomended|pg||
pc|cA|nt|gulyas: maybe the juniors don't smoke any more, or use matches:)|pg||
nt|garnetts: 5@H would likely go off too then --oddly no one doubled 7@S so they will gain for that if it goes 2 off---strange game|pg||
nt|gulyas: I mean really, what was N thinking??|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not thinking I imagine|pg||
nt|gulyas: he is lucky it goes down at all|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c3|pg||
nt|cherdano:  so his partner can win the second diamond|pg||
nt|gulyas: 2 down, which is not too bad since EW can make a few overtricks in @H partials|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|nt|cherdano:  and play a club through|pg||
pc|c5|nt|gulyas: well, 8 to the Greek, leading 10-8 now|pg||
nt|garnetts: I knew once i said the bridge was good--this little exhibit comes along lol|pg||
nt|don paulus: as it intended as penalty ?|pg||
nt|murat e: ý think now he counted points and will know dia ace w east|pg||
nt|don paulus: was|pg||
nt|elbec: they play reverse double|pg||
nt|elbec: so manno's double wasn't penalty|pg||
nt|marlowepi: even when diamonds prove to be 33, declarer still has to play trumps and give EW the lead, at which point they knock out club ace|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|oliverc: the trump promo still there, though|pg||
nt|chick: down 2 not vul is a decent result|pg||
nt|gulyas: I hate to say this, but I did not agree then either:)|pg||
nt|gulyas: S could have helped with the @DJ|pg||
nt|garnetts: flat board|pg||
nt|oliverc: yes|pg||
nt|gulyas: but he thought the @S ruff was obvious|pg||
nt|gulyas: so did we|pg||
nt|oliverc: clearly not obvious enough|pg||
nt|garnetts: both sides richly rewarded for their efforts|pg||
nt|gulyas: only person not sure was N...|pg||
nt|gulyas: agree, neither team deserved anything for their showing on this hand|pg||
nt|oliverc: Is West really going to bid 3@S with KQ stiff?|pg||
nt|vugraphzur: n seemed unhappy about @D 2|pg||
nt|unclejohn: @C8 will be key to keeping control|pg||
nt|murat e: takinh heart ace was another error|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s6|pc|cT|nt|cherdano:  yes but they needed two trump promotions :)|pg||
pc|s8|pg||

nt|gulyas: bye|pg||
nt|santyclz: Enjoy, Daniel.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|murat e: otherwise north has to throw dia king under the ace|pg||

nt|elbec: but i'm sure he'll guess it|pg||

nt|santyclz: Of course at their age I was playing "western rabbit" in which all 10hcp hands were mandatory openers.|pg||
nt|gulyas: these are the hands where you can get VERY frustrated with pd|pg||
nt|jstokes: 2@S likely shows diamonds and a decent hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it would not enter my mind to pass the W hand. but if 2D is multi and 1D doesnt even show Ds, i guess it is ok|pg||
nt|cindy:  no but arent you happy when after the second bid you know about the major suit aces and the club king|pg||
nt|jstokes: more than happy, Cindy :)|pg||
nt|cindy:  agree   looks like an opening hand to me too|pg||

pc|d7|nt|marlowepi: astonishing final pass by american E on  5 with 19 HCP and a partner who has jumped in response to a TO douuble|pg||
nt|marlowepi: about as astonishing as pass by N over 2S here|pg||
nt|don paulus: slam try ?|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the problem comes when partner plays you for full values -  see for example board 12|pg||
nt|gulyas: right, pd will raise u to game with 12 counts, and will go down|pg||
nt|gulyas: 170 in the OR|pg||
nt|gulyas: not the best defense there|pg||
nt|oliverc: All the EW pairs there will be breathing a sigh of relief to get out with a push|pg||
nt|garnetts: This one is fairly normal--little to be said about it|pg||
pc|d4|nt|cindy:  lol  yes to both|pg||
nt|elbec: now 3@s should be @s stop|pg||
nt|cindy:  a double would be nice now|pg||
nt|cindy:  at least|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S is going to offer to take Michaels off the card if N is going to pass on this hand when S uses it|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Well bid|pg||
pc|d9|nt|gulyas: this could make, 4@S+2@D tricks to start with|pg||

pc|dA|nt|andyv:  I would have passed|pg||
nt|gulyas: almost identical bidding here to the OR|pg||
nt|gulyas: 8tricks is the limit I would say|pg||
nt|garnetts: The defnec need to steer clear of @D's to hold it to the least number of tricks|pg||
nt|cindy:  wow|pg||
nt|elbec: maybe he knows that only a @h lead sets 6@c!|pg||
nt|murat e: they need to bid and make slam here|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|murat e: need to....|pg||
nt|unclejohn: can't make slam - this is the best they could do|pg||
nt|april7: 2@H should make but also 3 @D even with a @C ruff|pg||
nt|hoz: why deservedly?|pg||
pc|s6|nt|gulyas: a @C trick will develop eventually|pg||
nt|mdgraham: did West really overcall 1NT in the Open Room? That seems remarkable|pg||
nt|rgdruru: they can make 6 with this lead|pg||
pc|s4|nt|cindy:  N's mouth and fingers stapled shut no doubt|pg||
nt|marlowepi: for all he know (over 2S) the hand belonged to NS in 4S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: or eys|pg||
nt|marlowepi: italy has crushed foe after foe in this event. you aint going to beat them with the green card|pg||
pc|sT|nt|elbec: will end with all the tricks since he can't make club finesse|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|nt|gulyas: declarer has to get the @Ds right to even make this|pg||
nt|mcarroll: playing from E makes def more difficult, but I would expect declarer to make 8 tricks only|pg||
pc|h4|nt|april7: defence should make 6 tricks only|pg||
nt|gulyas: here is the 7th trick|pg||
nt|april7: no|pg||
nt|april7: for NS or EW???|pg||
nt|gulyas: well, has to take the @D finesse still|pg||
nt|gulyas: I mean for declarer|pg||
nt|april7: yes|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|mcarroll: on 22 they stopped in 5@C in Open|pg||
nt|frankaus: not home yet need to be careful|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|nt|gulyas: declarer will end up with an extra overtrick or 2 here|pg||
nt|andyv:  nothing prevents E from being 3-3-2-5 on this hand and, with a 10 count little reason to use garbage stayman|pg||
nt|elbec: not now|pg||
nt|elbec: yes, I agree with you|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hT|pg||
nt|chick: I don't think S should spend the @HA yet?|pg||

pc|s3|pc|s7|pc|sJ|nt|nulda: a towel into the ring|pg||
nt|nulda: the Czech Team has a couch from Netherlands - Ine Gielkens, former woman representative of Netherlands|pg||
nt|chick: pitch the club and get some club ruffs with the smaller trumps|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|gulyas: by NOT playing a @D to the K|pg||
nt|unclejohn: slam is anti-percentage, need @C finesse AND @H guess|pg||

nt|april7: 1NT by S|pg||

nt|mcarroll: scored as -1 3 imp swing|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: 1@S -1NT 2@H  2@S 3@H???|pg||
nt|elbec: my bridge teacher used to say: 1down no down, 2 down down, 3 down no bridge. what about 4 down? :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: against a possibly short club, it is debatable was the 2@C cue is - it can be played as natural. |pg||
pc|hT|nt|april7: but S passed already, so no 3@H anyway|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H playable  but should fail   - good spot|pg||
nt|marlowepi: what is the NT range?|pg||
nt|april7: why so aggressive, deserves to go down on @H lead|pg||
pc|h4|nt|nulda: in GF now|pg||
nt|oliverc: If NS bid to 3NT on  4, expect them to get to 6@S here :)|pg||
nt|gulyas: well, you need to have SOME sort of a forcing bid|pg||
nt|santyclz: Agree with 2@c, but should then backpedal.|pg||
nt|april7: but S would have made 3 @H|pg||
nt|marlowepi: incidentally a heart lead probably does not set slam on the previous hand---in fact E rates to make all 13 tricks on that lead|pg||
nt|murat e: other match is very close now and here the american team desperately needs something good|pg||
pc|h8|nt|andyv:  identical auction|pg||
nt|gulyas: 4@H would be 500, so well done both sides|pg||
nt|andyv:  play will be over at trick 1|pg||
nt|garnetts: pretty standard 1NT contract here |pg||
nt|gulyas: I have seen worse 3NT attempted here:)|pg||
nt|garnetts: I absolutely loath that 1@S rebid--saw it in action recently and they played 2@c ON A 3-3 FIT|pg||
nt|gulyas: 1NT should be his rebid|pg||
nt|elbec: looking at open room results, us could apparently gain something only on the last 4@s|pg||
nt|elbec: but you never know|pg||
nt|rogerclee: not true, 25 and 26 are possible partial swings|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|mdgraham: However having a general cue-bid available is a good idea, so even against short clubs 2@C is useful as a cue  |pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/VGData/minirama.html  for running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|unclejohn: a string of plus scores keeps the pressure on|pg||
nt|chick: and very likely will|pg||
pc|h2|nt|nulda: splinter bid|pg||
nt|nulda: cue-bid|pg||
nt|cherdano:  the 4@C cuebid should make south put on the brakes|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|oliverc: no sign of that LOL|pg||
nt|elbec: not easy to make 10 tricks here|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|gulyas: so, no matter how short 1@C can be, 2@C should always be a cue|pg||
nt|garnetts: What happens with the East hand when they play 1NT losing the first five or six diamonds with 5@C laydown|pg||
nt|jstokes: 3NT would be much easier|pg||
nt|jstokes: at least with clubs breaking -- maybe 3NT not so great on club lead|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|cherdano:  if he can read it as shortness|pg||
nt|ritong: for our possibly unaware specs, "carryover" is a part of the acquired score in qualifications when you play the same team again|pg||
nt|elbec: same contract here|pg||
nt|elbec: but played by west and with a @c lead|pg||
pc|hK|nt|nulda: S has no brakes, as u should have seen before|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 1nt rebid 18-19 range|pg||
nt|santyclz: Uh oh, wheels fell off in the open room.|pg||
nt|chick: a big swing for SKAWINA if they make this|pg||
pc|h6|nt|gulyas: this a good example of not having the same wavelength abt the values in overcall|pg||
pc|h7|nt|cherdano:  but now he will find out about the missing keycard and queen|pg||
nt|gulyas: if its OK to overcall with the S hand, N should not bid more than 2@C followed by 2@S|pg||
nt|santyclz: Agree 100%, Daniel.|pg||
nt|gulyas: now he is going down a lot|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes. homework failure|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North obviously took 2@D as showing a full value overcall|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|gulyas: another homework problem there|pg||
nt|chick: and they should|pg||
nt|gulyas: it depends how violent West is:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2NT would be a reasonable gamble by S on the second round|pg||
nt|marlowepi: better with ten of hearts obviouly|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mcarroll: At least the Open had interference here they were just optimistic|pg||
pc|d3|nt|nulda: 2 out of 5 without the Q, even S found the brake pedal|pg||
nt|cherdano:  but maybe it is rather North who bid too much here|pg||
nt|cherdano:  he is minimum in their style, has a void in partner's suit|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|cherdano:  and made two cuebids after a reverse|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Istanbul.09/Asp/RoundTeams.asp?qtournid=724&qroundno=9  for standings after 9 rounds. First 8 after 13 rounds advance to the quarter-finals ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: tomorrow|pg||
nt|cherdano:  this is a bit of speculation of course as we don't know their exact agreement|pg||
nt|nulda: so 3 more RR matches in the afternoon|pg||
nt|gulyas: since N could be any strong hand, all S showed was his pattern, not his overall strength|pg||
pc|h9|nt|cherdano:  5@S is already uncomfortably high|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It is, but cards are very friendly|pg||
nt|cherdano:  how would you play it though? any 4-1 trump break is dangerous|pg||
nt|oliverc: You're asking the wrong person  -  Roland would be in 7 here LOL|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Win the club, cash two top spades ending in hand. If no queen, work with hearts. If West has four trumps I am still ok. Can't do anything if East has Q10xx anyway|pg||
nt|oliverc: sounds right|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Unblock @HQ first of course|pg||
nt|cherdano:  you still run into problems with spades 4-1 onside i think roland|pg||
nt|cherdano:  say you ruff a heart,how you dont have an entry back to hand|pg||
nt|cherdano:  i think you should play @DK earlier|pg||
nt|cherdano:  to set up a diamond|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Can't I lead a spade up later? Requires that West has four hearts along with four trumps|pg||
nt|april7: N gets an uppercut in @S now|pg||
nt|fabsayc: how to make now?|pg||
nt|chick: start by winning the spade lead :)|pg||
nt|frankaus: re|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|nt|santyclz: Every journey...|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|cherdano:  seems better to knock out @DA earlier, to get the @DQ as entry back to hand|pg||
pc|dK|nt|april7: tricky now,@S King and @C J discrding the @H loser|pg||
nt|april7: or overruffing and discarding later|pg||
pc|d5|nt|fabsayc: i want to go back and play 3nt|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mcarroll: E has no entry to the @DS|pg||

pc|dJ|nt|santyclz: Or 4@s and play any card other than the q on the @d return.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: really?|pg||

pc|s4|nt|elbec: yes 2 more trumps|pg||

nt|chick: looking more and more like down now|pg||
nt|santyclz: Of course, the q is the normal play, I'm not disputing that, it's just unfortunate.|pg||
nt|elbec: west is squeezed|pg||
nt|marlowepi: about a third of the 14 point hands i hold look at least a little like upgrades, but it would never occur to me to open 1N on this N hand if playing 15-17|pg||
pc|sK|nt|santyclz: As for whether s should overcall, I think so.  I, at least, need all the help I can get on opening lead.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|marlowepi: really?|pg||

nt|cindy:  green = go   yeh  yellow seems more logical|pg||
nt|jstokes: but he still has one diamond, doesn't he, and that is all he needs|pg||
nt|elbec: and so he plays ace of diamonds and diamonds|pg||
nt|elbec: and 10 of diamonds is good now|pg||
nt|elbec: and he discards a spade|pg||
nt|marlowepi: then S pulls another trump from his discard pile|pg||
nt|elbec: discarding a club from the dummy|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes ten of D is good, but E has it|pg||
nt|elbec: if west discard a diamond|pg||
nt|ady: 2 red aces|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I go with 5@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: he really has no reason to bid on|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  or the Zias of the world|pg||
nt|gulyas: with THAT hand?? ouch|pg||
nt|andyv:  I guess we didn't should loud enough, Dan|pg||
nt|garnetts: Might get there if South bids 3@C and over 3NT continues with 4@D|pg||
nt|elbec: 3@c is stayman|pg||
nt|frankaus: sure they will find they miss 2KC|pg||
nt|marlowepi: everyone agree with the TO X?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: looks like a pass to me|pg||
pc|h5|nt|elbec: no no|pg||
nt|elbec: sorry|pg||
nt|gulyas: sry folks, have to go, and I was not much of help:(|pg||
nt|cindy:  bye|pg||
nt|chick: nah, not with two 3 card majors|pg||
nt|april7: I don't|pg||
pc|h2|nt|oliverc: over 3@S or 4@H, does South have much reason to continue beyond 4@H, with the|pg||
nt|oliverc: likelyhood of wasted values in Spades|pg||
nt|garnetts: The 3@S seems might odd to me |pg||
nt|jstokes: bye Daniel, thanks|pg||
nt|elbec: ace of clubs and queen of diamonds|pg||
nt|gulyas: sometimes work gets busy:(|pg||
nt|gulyas: nye|pg||
nt|gulyas: bye|pg||
nt|marlowepi: so long daniel. maybe exit with Q of D?|pg||
nt|elbec: 3@d shows one major|pg||
nt|elbec: 3@h shows @s|pg||
nt|elbec: and 3@s fixes spades|pg||
pc|hA|nt|oliverc: no nasty surprises here|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|chick: in the other room, N passed 3@H|pg||
nt|santyclz: Are they searching for 3nt or q'ing for a possible @c slam?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: priority is best game|pg||
nt|fabsayc: since neither has made forcing bids|pg||
nt|gulyas: totally flat hand, even 4@S was too high as we could see in the OR|pg||
nt|gulyas: yes, I will exit with her:)|pg||
nt|frankaus: wd|pg||
pc|h7|nt|cherdano:  except for this lead!|pg||
nt|elbec: that's the solution|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|oliverc: freely cue-bidding 1st or second round controls|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but E can exit club|pg||
nt|murat e: this bid usually implies a weak hand w 6 spades|pg||
nt|frankaus: this wont take long - i expect|pg||
nt|ady: see if west can duck first round of hearts|pg||
nt|ady: not guaranteed     if east wins first heart with the queen and switches to a trump this can go down|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h3|pg||
nt|fabsayc: lovely double by drijver|pg||
nt|garnetts: 4@C showing the first round control would leave South thinking his partner has little in the way of wasted spade values|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s7|nt|andyv:  he saw the white, not the 1100|pg||
nt|garnetts: I do not think that 4NT here should be blackwood|pg||
nt|oliverc: wow|pg||
nt|garnetts: If North bid the grand it might even make on the A@S lead|pg||
nt|oliverc: naive to lead the A@S after the 4@S bid|pg||
nt|garnetts: I have been told 4NT is blackwood--which doesn't shock me--just that it is a poor use of the bid in this auction |pg||
nt|gulyas: what is N thinking abt?|pg||
nt|gulyas: he really has nothing extra|pg||
nt|murat e: but north having 5-5 in the blacks decided to block opp red suit bids and bid 3 spades|pg||
pc|sT|nt|nulda: E must try the king|pg||
nt|cherdano:  yes no other hope|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|oliverc: no problem really. what chance South has QJxx(x)|pg||
nt|oliverc: omg|pg||
pc|hT|nt|gulyas: doh|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|fabsayc: hmm|pg||
nt|santyclz: Uh oh.|pg||
nt|oliverc: Juniors  -  no fear|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h6|pg||
nt|gulyas: the same 12 tricks here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i thought he had a wire on this hand, apparently not|pg||
nt|ady: trump|pg||
pc|h9|nt|chick: hopes to prevent spade ruffs?|pg||
nt|oliverc: Thanks all. I have to go|pg||
pc|d4|nt|garnetts: I go on a very old principle that having shown your hand with the rebid of 2NT --blackwood is best left to partner--as are decisions  baout whether to bid the grand|pg||
nt|gulyas: I can understand that:)|pg||
pc|s9|nt|gulyas: I did not like the 4@S, but nv vs vul, I can see that - 5@S is unheard of|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|ady: nice defence from west|pg||
nt|hoz: anyone agree with 2NT (after redouble)?|pg||
nt|chick: depends on their agreements .. what would an immediate 2N show?|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|nt|don paulus: 1 off also ?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 1N is probably enough, but 2N doesnt bother me|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d6|pg||
nt|nulda: so first IMP for Netherlands|pg||
nt|mcarroll: This is now becoming interesting|pg||
nt|ady: can make on a cross ruff now|pg||
pc|c4|nt|santyclz: Krysa couldn't believe it.|pg||
pc|c3|nt|gulyas: right|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ady: east needed to switch to a trump|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sJ|nt|andyv:  with N hand I'd have passed 2@s and waited to see if pd made any other moves|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|ritong: out of the schneider, but very painful anyway|pg||
nt|oliverc: very efdinitely|pg||
nt|marlowepi: passing and doubling 2H with the N hand is not the way to get maximum firepower out of that collection|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|c2|nt|santyclz: (And a source of tricks.)|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s6|pg||
nt|frankaus: still looks -1|pg||
pc|sA|pc|dJ|pc|d8|pc|d5|pg||
pc|c5|nt|gulyas: this pretty much settles the winner of the match|pg||
nt|garnetts: North bid his hand not once but 3 times|pg||
pc|c9|nt|ady: ruff with 6|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c8|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cT|nt|chick: making an overtrick it seems|pg||

nt|nulda: so difficult for the italians to play in spades now|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: They do OK in clubs too.|pg||
nt|elbec: 5@c is a very tough contract|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jstokes: wow|pg||
nt|ritong: my guess is he has 5@h -1 on his conscience and is on tilt|pg||
nt|nulda: oh|pg||
mb|p|nt|murat e: macura stole spade suit from them|pg||
pc|h5|nt|nulda: must be made|pg||
nt|jstokes: 8 easy tricks|pg||
nt|brolucius: If 2@C did show both majors, then this misunderstanding seems to be West's fault.|pg||
nt|elbec: 6hearts and 2 ruffs|pg||
nt|murat e: 16 imps|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|nt|ritong: donnerwetter|pg||
mc|8|nt|Walddk2: What a turnaround. At some point in the previous set Italy were up by 40 IMPs|pg||
pg||

nt|Walddk2: yes, 680|pg||
nt|Walddk2: N was entitled to @HJ|pg||
nt|mdgraham: we come to the last deal|pg||
nt|chick: with two boards to go, it's back to a close contest again |pg||
nt|chick: oops one board to play|pg||
nt|gulyas: I cannot see how this pair can come back from this morally|pg||
nt|garnetts: Must think his partner is both hard of hearing and/or blind|pg||
nt|gulyas: even tho there are still boards to play, S just wants to be out of there|pg||
nt|ady: very nice from west  playing low to first heart|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|fabsayc: skawina probably needs another swing to qualify|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|santyclz: Looks like everybody's 3nt.|pg||
mb|d|nt|andyv:  this board created some excitement in the OR|pg||
nt|april7: tricky hand, 6@C makes and 6@H goes down,lets see what EW will play|pg||
nt|andyv:  W will find a very disappointing dummy...trick will be to stay low|pg||
nt|cindy:  S is going to have to lead a @c to beat 4@h i think|pg||
nt|april7: almost 6 @S|pg||
mb|4H|mb|d|nt|nulda: 2 spades from NS|pg||
nt|nulda: 3 spades go down definitely|pg||
nt|cherdano:  3@D is a good preempt here with 3-1 in the majors|pg||
nt|nulda: but 3d should go down too|pg||
nt|oliverc: but we said that about the 3NT, nulda|pg||
nt|josj: and even more i the oher match on BBO :)|pg||
nt|josj: in|pg||
nt|josj: what about 7NT on a vienna coup?|pg||
nt|andyv:  and 6N is off the top|pg||
nt|andyv:  7N on vienna:)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: they were in 10th place, 5 behind the 8th and last qualifying spot|pg||
nt|andyv:  this should help:)|pg||
nt|murat e: only a spade lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 9 corrected to 12 tricks|pg||
nt|andyv:  W doesn't have a great hand to balance with|pg||
mb|4S|nt|andyv:  Hi Avram and Jos|pg||
nt|gulyas: will S reopen?|pg||
nt|andyv:  he did|pg||
nt|gulyas: yep, I see now:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  they can make 3@d|pg||
nt|gulyas: how abt 3NT?:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  who?|pg||
nt|gulyas: well, off 5 tops, but almost:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
nt|cindy:  yes @s|pg||
nt|murat e: same lead in open room|pg||
nt|cindy:  failed to see that @s dub in S :-)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|nulda: 3d one down I would bet|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Transfer to 4@H|pg||
nt|gulyas: has to get @Ss right to make 3@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: There are two sequences possible. 1N-4@C-4@H and 1N-2@D-2@H-4@H.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Unless the latter is a slam try.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: partnerships can have fun deciding which sequence means what|pg||
nt|gulyas: the latter shows some slam interest in my book|pg||
nt|murat e: north took sp king cashed club ace then strangely played another club|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sunit: 88/91 now|pg||
nt|april7: hi, but would you like to be in 7NT? 6 @C is enough, but they will also play 6@H like in OR|pg||
nt|josj: nope...|pg||
nt|andyv:  no, 7 is for hands you want to make the newpaper column on|pg||
nt|ady: n/s  can make 9 tricks in spades   and 10 if hearts are not played before club towards king|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ritong: reasonable action from macura|pg||
nt|andyv:  bidding should help there|pg||
nt|gulyas: interesting, with AK and AKQ in 2 suits, W leads - a trump:)|pg||
nt|ady: thats that|pg||
nt|frankaus: wow the killing lead|pg||
pc|h8|nt|santyclz: Killing lead.|pg||
nt|josj: that's why I hope someone will bid 7 :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and the double of 6@H too for that matter|pg||
nt|gulyas: a nice triple squeeze really|pg||
nt|gulyas: that double is uncalled for|pg||
nt|april7: S should not X, they might run to NT|pg||
nt|andyv:  dbl of 6@h in OR seemed suicidal, but neither W or E budged...almost like a deer caught in the headlights|pg||
nt|murat e: and contract was made|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|april7: yes, absolutely|pg||
nt|Walddk4: same happened in the other match|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 6@C in one room, 6@HX in the other|pg||
nt|april7: but will E pass 6@C???|pg||
nt|andyv:  missing a control, W may opt for 6@c |pg||
nt|april7: he really should!!!|pg||
nt|april7: Q of @C a very big card!!!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 5@S is a convenient response to RKCK. 2 aces and trump queen. He has that whether hearts or clubs are trumps :)|pg||
nt|april7: decisive board!!|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|cherdano:  yes first three tricks|pg||
nt|april7: W might opt for 6NT?|pg||
nt|mildredb: :)  didn't know there was a Mildred!  |pg||
nt|andyv:  W hasn't shown any support for @hs... time for E to reevaluate the Q@c|pg||
nt|april7: is 5NT a proposition to play?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Istanbul.09/Asp/RoundTeams.asp?qtournid=724&qroundno=11  for standings after 11 rounds. First 8 after 13 rounds advance to the quarter-finals ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: tomorrow. One more round of Swiss after this, in about 30 minutes|pg||
nt|andyv:  no, sounds more like we have all the controls|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Again the other hand is playing the NT here|pg||
nt|frankaus: not that hard when u have AK A outside|pg||
pc|dA|nt|cherdano:  and @DAQ|pg||
nt|oliverc: http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Istanbul.09/Asp/RoundTeams.asp?qtournid=724&qroundno=9|pg||
nt|nulda: so 5 more Imps to J-C theam|pg||
nt|elbec: they can make it|pg||
pc|d5|nt|april7: then they might play 7NT , but W knows a control is missing|pg||
nt|nickd: no, after club jump ace asking is with @c suit|pg||
nt|andyv:  so, RKC was for @cs here|pg||
nt|andyv:  and E shows the k@s|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Oh well, goodbye to 6@C and 6@H. I think the Greeks stop in 6NT|pg||
nt|april7: then 7NT is possible and a good player will make it|pg||
nt|gulyas: or 7@C:)|pg||
nt|ritong: @c to the 9?|pg||
nt|don paulus: this smells like they want a ruff :)|pg||
nt|murat e: declarer in dilemna|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|cherdano:  hi Henri!|pg||
pc|sA|nt|gulyas: how do you know? even if W has those above mentioned honors, cannot E have the @SQ? he would still pass all the way|pg||
pc|s3|nt|nulda: 64-1 and 25-0|pg||
pc|s2|nt|cindy:  blue needed that|pg||
nt|frankaus: still need to cash out|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|ritong: he accepts to pay double partscore swing, knowing he has a good score sheet, and if 4@s is on, pard will probably bid again|pg||
nt|nickd: well at least 5 imps for greek team:)|pg||
nt|gulyas: S not happy, he wanted a @H contract:)|pg||
nt|ritong: of course|pg||
pc|sT|nt|andyv:  now we can see how well declarer plays this... S can be squeezed in the majors|pg||
nt|gulyas: and after you find out his 6@H, 3@D, and at least 2@C cards, I am not sure you will get it right...|pg||
nt|andyv:  well, declarer will soon now W's distribution, so he may go for the 4-2 odds on the @sQ|pg||
nt|gulyas: right|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|Walddk2: Thanks all, back in 1 hour and a wee bit. Enjoy your breakfast, lunch, dinner, nightcap, whatever|pg||
nt|ritong: on the other hand, he avoids a big accident|pg||
nt|cherdano:  you would pass and jump to 4@S over a reopening double?|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|ritong: in that specific context|pg||
nt|nulda: I have to go to work unfortunately in the afternoon, so good luck for the Czech juniors :)|pg||
nt|ritong: otherwise, i bid my hand with 3@s|pg||
nt|nulda: it would be nice to see them in the play-off|pg||
nt|cherdano:  they are on their way Vladimir!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They are almost there already|pg||
nt|ritong: they will|pg||
nt|marlowepi: what was double of 2H? why not 2S? is that negative?|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s8|pg||
nt|nulda: I hope so|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You don't think he will make it, Nikos?|pg||
nt|andyv:  either way, a nice gain for the Greek team|pg||

nt|jstokes: Japan-Czech has specialized in big comebacks -- still not over, of course|pg||
nt|nulda: such a swing|pg||
nt|elbec: good hand in open room for Japan-Czech|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|elbec: ns can make 2@s|pg||
nt|brolucius: Not much luck involved in the recent swings. It has been a question of 'justice done'.|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|nulda: 2h shows 5 spades, I think|pg||
mb|d|nt|jstokes: although showing the majors with 4-6 and finding partner with 4 good hearts seems a bit luck|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s5|pc|s6|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s4|nt|nulda: so it needs good nerves now for NS |pg||
pc|s7|nt|brolucius: West should really wait for a second double before venturing 4@H on that hand. But the bid could have worked.|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|nulda: 2h and one diamond for NS could not escape :)|pg||
pc|c8|nt|nulda: so 4 IMPs probably|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c9|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|brolucius: The range for a third-seat 2@H is quite wide, so declarer may still hope that the @DA is onside.|pg||
nt|murat e: can take cl ruff|pg||
nt|brolucius: It will be another deserved swing in the bidding for N-S, since it was the 2@H opening that cause the problem (aided by South pre-emptive jump).|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|nt|gulyas: with only @Hs and @Ss left, he would have had to give a @H trick or open up @Ss|pg||
nt|gulyas: playing a @H off dummy was not a good idea|pg||
nt|gulyas: 5530 is a nice pattern|pg||
nt|gulyas: 2@C?? why not 3 or 4?|pg||
nt|garnetts: 3@C seems righ on the East tickets to me|pg||
nt|gulyas: whats the point in 2@C? I cannot see it|pg||
nt|garnetts: not that keen on 4@C too balanced |pg||
nt|gulyas: anybody who plays ghestem should be shot:)|pg||
nt|garnetts: I would rather psyche 1NT than bid 2@C |pg||
nt|marlowepi: better for W to pass, as is usually the case when preempt hand faces strong bal;anced|pg||
nt|ritong: really?|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: amazing that N did not open 1S|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|andyv:  3@h must be non forcing |pg||
nt|gulyas: probably|pg||
nt|andyv:  it certainly isn't pretty:)|pg||
nt|gulyas: I have not heard of a sys that lets you do that, but I may be too young:)|pg||
nt|garnetts: 3@C might be Ghestem or some other vile convention|pg||
nt|gulyas: if somebody stole my 3@C bid, I would rather bid 4@C than 2|pg||
nt|marlowepi: though many disagree, i think weak 2s with 7 card suits are a bad idea|pg||
nt|cindy:  they have 2@d available also though  right ?|pg||
nt|cindy:  im such a big mouth it looks more like 3@s to me|pg||
nt|ritong: di franco can t have passed this|pg||
nt|vugraphzur: sorry|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: lev2, yes, but lev3?|pg||
nt|ritong: np|pg||
mb|2H|nt|andyv:  @S lead gives the most trouble to 4@s|pg||
nt|gulyas: draw trumps and play @Ds?|pg||
nt|andyv:  have to|pg||
nt|garnetts: what is the point of 2@D?  If you must bid then 2@H surely|pg||
nt|gulyas: I mean, what more do you need? a good, semi-solid 7c suit, nothing outside... doesn't that scream PREEMPT?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: for me availability of mnulti has no bearing on this. 3S or pass, and i vote for pass. |pg||
nt|vugraphzur: 3@D :singleton in a minor|pg||
nt|ritong: they will probably fall back on their feet|pg||
nt|don paulus: great job Ozgur as this is 1st time we notice you are there :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|gulyas: if that is trouble, I am willing to do that every day:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  other lead, like @h, allows the @c ruff|pg||
nt|vugraphzur: 4@C : void|pg||
nt|murat e: south gave information about bad trump break|pg||
nt|ritong: play a better spot than 6nt and lose some imps|pg||
nt|ritong: basically 2|pg||
mb|p|pc|cT|nt|gulyas: now, whoever messed up the sys is at fault|pg||
nt|andyv:  immaterial now... i think S should have raised holding an A and a stiff... potentialy 2 tricks for pd.|pg||
nt|garnetts: I agree actually if I cannot bid 3@C then pass or 4@C is OK or 1NT|pg||
nt|gulyas: 1NT is funny:)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 3NT has good chances|pg||
nt|marlowepi: though probably all auctions lead to a partscore in hearts|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|gulyas: well, 4@S needs some work here|pg||
nt|garnetts: You would thnik west has a very reasonable double of 4@S wouldn't you?  |pg||
nt|gulyas: running scores for other matches: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/VGData/minirama.html|pg||
nt|gulyas: well, if pd can have this rubbish, I would just hide and not double:)|pg||
pc|c8|nt|gulyas: if 3@H was NF, N should have bid game|pg||
nt|ady: this will be fail on bad split|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|nt|gulyas: if S was forcing, he should not have passed:)|pg||
nt|ritong: here we go|pg||
nt|don paulus: got to find Q @d anyway|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|andyv:  and if non forcing how bad can the bid be?|pg||
nt|andyv:  6 to the Q and out?|pg||
nt|gulyas: I still doubt it could be worse than this|pg||
nt|gulyas: N, with a partial fit in @H should be able to see game somehow|pg||
nt|gulyas: maybe his earlier 5@S bid backfired:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: recommended auction:  PPP 2N P 4H P 4S end|pg||
nt|cindy:  ok  next|pg||
nt|cindy:  push|pg||
nt|marlowepi: transfer then cue also acceptable|pg||
nt|mcarroll: The lead changes hands?|pg||
nt|vugraphzur: 2@H: 4@C 15-17|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|s4|nt|elbec: @h lead wasn't maybe the best one|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ady: Martin right   4@S best|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|gulyas: but I can see your point, he has all suits, good trumps, and a void in pd suit|pg||
nt|april7: trump is best now, otherwise E can make 10 tricks|pg||
nt|marlowepi: or possibly NS might end with a small minus in 3S|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Coffee obviously working|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h8|nt|garnetts: My partner overcalls and I have that then they can play in 8@S --well if it makes then as they say in French  T'ant pis|pg||

nt|mcarroll: 16 imps to Japan/Czech in l;ast 2 boards and anothe potential double digit here|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  hope they don't play flannery:)|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N!|nt|josj: ty Roland|pg||
nt|gulyas: the only tight match, to everybody's surprise is the USA-Greece match|pg||
nt|gulyas: US by 1 if I can read right|pg||
nt|garnetts: This is likely to end in 4@S and although it is possible to defeat it will likely make|pg||
nt|murat e: a potential win for americans on this board if rebids clubs now|pg||
nt|ritong: although i certainly would open west hand 1 NT, and tons of others too i guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: welcome Jos, Roland:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: I have barred commentators for less|pg||

mb|p|pc|hQ|pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|gulyas: its not my fav, but I happen to play it now, it has its place in a str@C sys|pg||
nt|ritong: so here comes the expected swing|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|gulyas: 2@S is not a bad contract either|pg||
nt|garnetts: Declarer can set up the long club on the J@C lead unless the defence finds the @D swict which is not obvious|pg||
nt|gulyas: Poland played it in 4@Sx and ended up with an overtrick on bd 27|pg||
nt|sybarra: this doesnt look like it plays all that well |pg||
pc|h4|nt|garnetts: That must have taken some effort Daniel  :)|pg||
nt|ady: this looks way overboard|pg||
pc|h6|nt|marlowepi: yes, but N already stepped out of character when he forook the green card on the first round of bidding, dont expect him to do it twice in a row:)|pg||
nt|elbec: indeed|pg||
pc|h8|nt|marlowepi: 1S was not a well conceived choice|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think it playes well enough to make 7 tricks|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|gulyas: yes, from both sides:)|pg||
nt|elbec: with @c lead he could arrive to 8 tricks|pg||
nt|elbec: all the red suits break 33|pg||
nt|mcarroll: This could be the third double digit gain in a row for Japan/Czech|pg||
nt|ady: spec asked how many boards in the final?|pg||
nt|vugraphzur: 3x16|pg||
pc|d6|nt|marlowepi: unless perfect defense|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pc|d2|pg||
pc|c6|nt|marlowepi: really W should have held up the heat ace|pg||
pc|c5|nt|gulyas: I think having a bad set is catching in the French team|pg||
nt|garnetts: I cannot think of any hand where I would choose to lead from Jxxx rather than J10x|pg||
nt|gulyas: they climbed all the way to SIX @Ss on this one|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mcarroll: Only 6 imp swing|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dK|pc|dA|nt|gulyas: agree there again|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|garnetts: If they made 11 last time this must be a spread lol|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cJ|pc|c4|pc|c8|pg||
nt|garnetts: By the way this is case where North probably should have played the K@D at the first chance |pg||
nt|ritong: and two boards to go|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ritong: next hand is a slam|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h9|nt|andyv:  cash out time|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||

pc|c9|pc|d8|pc|d4|pc|s5|pg||
nt|andyv:  oh oh|pg||
mc|6|nt|ady: west can be end played|pg||
nt|marlowepi: second diamond was a serious error. N should have been able to read club spot as low. even so, S should have returned his lowest club, not second lowest|pg||

nt|ritong: well declarer is marked with long @cs, no opposition with 10xx|pg||
nt|brolucius: A diamond lead was hard to find indeed after South's 1@D response at the other table.|pg||
nt|jstokes: heart seems normal lead, especially if 1@H only showed points, not hearts|pg||
nt|ritong: @hs are in dummy|pg||

mb|3C|nt|garnetts: Good gadget here transfer to 2@S |pg||

mb|3H|nt|gulyas: 5@D not terrible, if you can get away with 1 trump loser you are OK|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 2 trump tricks  and a spade to lose|pg||

nt|gulyas: a crummy suit and a minimum?:)|pg||
nt|gulyas: if he goes on to 3NT, I would whack it with the S hand|pg||
nt|garnetts: This might make if the defence are not careful which they seem to be on that lead|pg||
nt|gulyas: trump lead is good enough to beat it|pg||
nt|gulyas: but @H lead would have gotten to several down...|pg||
nt|gulyas: he can take 9 tricks on a crossruff, thats all|pg||
nt|garnetts: I think I agree with people suggesting 4@S is perhaps the best spot--but so is a partscore |pg||
nt|garnetts: Win the K@C pass the J@D would be my line |pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: 4@S far too expensive|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  or N|pg||
nt|ritong: however, they first need to declare 7|pg||

nt|marlowepi: attack on the unbid suit would work better, or 9 of Ds but latter is tough to find|pg||
pc|h9|nt|mcarroll: A flat board for a change|pg||
nt|april7: difficult to defeat, W must step in with ace of @D and switch to @S and E must continue @S, let see what will happen|pg||

pc|hA|pg||

pc|c9|pg||
pc|cA|nt|marlowepi: esp diff to defeat if N takes first 9|pg||

nt|april7: now @Hfinesse is necessary|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|c8|nt|andyv:  and pass would indicate some @c tolerance|pg||
pc|h8|nt|marlowepi: the wimpy, uselss 2S bid should have achieves\d its usual destiny.....E should double 3S (responsive) and then probably 500. an opening 3S fetches double-pass-4H for a HUGE win|pg||
pc|d6|nt|unclejohn: it's academic now, but the trump sqz is the best chance for 7 - run 4 trumps and clubs ending in north, then either ruff out the spades or drop east's diamonds|pg||
nt|ritong: ya rite|pg||
pc|h3|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N!|nt|gulyas: USA Blue taking a comfortable lead, simply by not making so many mistakes|pg||
nt|ady: but good sac against 4@H|pg||
nt|marlowepi: there is much to be said for opening 1H at these colors on S hand|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|garnetts: I must say that the k@C then a @D to the ace and the Q@D covered would have made it|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  and ty Ozgur for a great job.|pg||

nt|ritong: but jeremy chickened out|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c3|nt|garnetts: well he did this time and might have that time--but I agree things might look different |pg||
nt|gulyas: last board of the match here|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|gulyas: yeah, playing low really made no sense|pg||
nt|cindy:  this looks like 6 tricks only|pg||
nt|ady: spec observed 5 clubs can make  playing on spade suit|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|gulyas: spec tells me 500 was Michilsen's reward for x-ing the 3NT last hand, btw|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|andyv:  it's interesting how that hand just seem to have a life of its own|pg||
nt|andyv:  looking at both hands, you might not want to even be in 1n:)|pg||
nt|gulyas: I could not agree more with that double|pg||
nt|jstokes: winning decision again by west not to bid|pg||
pc|s4|nt|elbec: it's not a bad game|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mcarroll: Its a pretty good game unless W leads @CS|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|gulyas: honestly, the level of play was not too high this match so far, but maybe its still too early in Turkey as well:)|pg||
nt|gulyas: hopefully we will have better bridge in the 2nd half of the QFs|pg||
nt|andyv:  and there has to be a lot of nervous tension amongst several of the players who aren't used to this big of stage.|pg||
nt|elbec: 9 tricks|pg||
nt|mcarroll: (9 tricks now|pg||
pc|cK|nt|elbec: two impressive 3nt are bringing back italy ahead of japan-czech|pg||

nt|brolucius: So, the club lead worked out just fine. And (for a change) no IMPs changed hands.|pg||
nt|nulda: passed out in CR|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Juniors??|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C!|mb|1D|nt|brolucius: Thank goodness this was not the last board. (It would be the dampest squib ever). Oh, someone has opened here.|pg||
mb|1S|nt|nulda: Michal and Milan have written in their CC in the column Passed Hand "WE DONT PASS"|pg||
nt|ritong: cowboys:)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|Walddk2: double possible now, showing hearts|pg||
nt|brolucius: South could show the hearts by doubling here (in some systems, but it depends on whether 1@C was natural).|pg||
nt|Walddk2: known as Snapdragon|pg||
mb|p|nt|ryskiel_: 4@S makeable on NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|murat e: spades will win the battle can make even 4|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ritong: @hs + tolerance for pard s suit i guess|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ritong: but rather exactly 5 @hs|pg||
nt|ritong: the idea being, when you bid them, you have 6+|pg||
nt|brolucius: North is nervous of raising spades, having opened on just 9 points.|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: But he did pass on the previous round. South should remember that.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: But you can only bid them if you have tolerance for diamonds|pg||
mb|p|pc|c9|nt|murat e: this is one down|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cQ|pc|cT|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, alas|pg||

pc|s8|nt|ritong: no suspense on the last board|pg||
pc|s5|nt|murat e: 16 imps italian team will need on last board|pg||
nt|brolucius: If this does go down, the few IMPs gained could be priceless, with a poor board perhaps awaiting the team in the lead on 16.|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|nulda: 16 IMPs for the last board |pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@HXX making :)|pg||
nt|nulda: still nervous|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That's what Italy need now|pg||
nt|nulda: good result for Italy in the CR on board 16|pg||
nt|ritong: you never know what can happen when BOTH teams think they need points|pg||
nt|ritong: but not the case here|pg||
nt|nulda: I should go to my private club to play, but I cant now, come on boys|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s4|nt|elbec: does anybody know it official score is the same of BBo score?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|elbec: if*|pg||
nt|ritong: it never is|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|brolucius: It usually is.|pg||
nt|ritong: BBO can t afford to be "official" scorer|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ritong: yes, david, 95% of the time score is exact|pg||
nt|nulda: 4h doubled vuln. is 790+200 = 990 (just 15 IMPs) is that ok?|pg||
pc|h2|pc|s6|pc|sK|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yet again, North-South at this table have gained a few IMPs from their bidding. They will be well pleased with their set (I will not mention any 5@H contracts).|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h3|nt|elbec: only 14 IMPs|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h9|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They need a doubled overtrick for a tie, redouble for a win|pg||
nt|ritong: i wonder what happened to him on board 6, by the way|pg||
nt|ritong: taking an other bid over 4@h is really strange|pg||
nt|ritong: but afterwards, it conducted him to overcall 2@c with a terrible hand 6@h4@s|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d7|pc|dQ|pc|dK|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h4|pc|hK|nt|ritong: and score +670 two seconds later  so what do wwe know|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But remember, score may be off by 3 imps, was td call may be 1 imp and possible misclaim worth 2, both were in favor of j-c|pg||
mc|8|nt|brolucius: Anyway, we await some drama on the very last board.|pg||
nt|elbec: also in board 9 there was apparentely a mistake|pg||
nt|nulda: so come on boys, 15 IMPs |pg||
nt|brolucius: At least they have been granted a board where there is a chance of some action. (Or so we are told)|pg||

nt|Walddk2: also thanks to our many excellent commentators|pg||
nt|nulda: JUNIOR WORLD CHAMPIONS - Milan and Michal|pg||
nt|ritong: although this might produce 13 imps, and we are not absolutely sure about the real score|pg||
nt|nulda: I hope its correct|pg||
nt|ritong: for one, a TD appeal on one overtrick|pg||
nt|brolucius: That's right. It is well worth landing this vulnerable game and ten, perhaps, hoping for some action off the table.|pg||
pc|h9|nt|Walddk2: Finally, our appreciation to the WBF and TBF for ensuring that this wonderful inaugural event is brought to BBO vugraph. Murat Molva, Ata Aydin, M. Fahir Üzümcü and Cengiz Arigun ...|pg||
