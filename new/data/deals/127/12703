nt|sybarra: hello Raija :)  welcome  and hi Mike :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|mdgraham: Good evening all. Welcome to the second half   |pg||
mb|2S|nt|athene: this all comes down to how much trouble south can cause with his trump holding|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Mike 1|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: Hi Shirley|pg||
nt|sybarra: W hand looks like one of mine :(|pg||
nt|davidstern: Hi Shirley|pg||
nt|vugraphzcu: EW play 5cM strong NT, NS 5CM strong NT as before|pg||
nt|lestergold: some very good players here|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: If you diagnosed the trump position 4@H can be made here|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome David :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzcu: welcome back all|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: East's nickname is "Binkie" |pg||
nt|lestergold: Callaghan highly respected one of england';s top player s heather Dhondy a very prominent respcted player Hallberg world class|pg||
nt|davidstern: Even with the bad spade break 4@S has some chances|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d2|nt|mdgraham: also the name of Death's horse in the Terry Pratchett Discworld books|pg||
nt|lestergold: and Ewart I do not know as well but I believe considered a good player|pg||
pc|dA|nt|davidstern: I played with Brian Callaghan in a team in San Remo - good team mate|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dK|nt|davidstern: Gunnar seems to be selling his hand short|pg||
pc|s4|pc|d6|pg||
nt|athene: @HA and another is down immediately; the missing @H8 might influence declarer's decision a bit, perhaps|pg||
nt|vugraphzcu: 3@h shows 1-4-4-4|pg||
nt|athene: there are lots of ways to play this heart suit - you might lead small from west and then judge what to do|pg||
nt|ralfwil: The bad communications will perhaps make playing trumps with 2 losses|pg||
nt|athene: for example lead to the @H10 and then if that loses to the @HJ, finesse south for the @HK too|pg||
nt|athene: if you think north will fly in with the @HK when he has it (especially @HKx) this gives you decent odds|pg||
nt|athene: but at this level you expect north to play low even from @HKx, most of the time|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree with that William|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and at least from Coyle|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hA|nt|peachy: not any more|pg||
pc|h3|nt|patricck: That line still effectively gives you better odds than the Ace and another play, but Ralf is right....there are communication issues here as well|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|lestergold: Callagahn's nickname is Binky h e invented Binky points a c0omplex fine tuning variation on Miltons |pg||
nt|davidstern: Passed 1@C then simple preference|pg||
nt|peachy: he was giving leeway for balancer|pg||
nt|davidstern: And he looks a little like a Binky|pg||
pc|s3|nt|peachy: but I would not have been able to do it....|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sA|nt|athene: the other interesting play is, if declarer leads to the @H10, you win the @HK as south|pg||
nt|athene: then he might lay down the ace, and you have your two trump tricks|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|lestergold: if anyone can find a way of making this , Halberg might|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|pc|s9|pc|sT|pg||
nt|patricck: the 8@H popping might make him suspicious about that, but would still be a nice play|pg||

nt|davidstern: Yes if they played perfectly why would we turn up and play against them|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: fencing better ......|pg||
nt|davidstern: 3@S by N/S|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i am not a big fan of 2@C as found in the other room|pg||
nt|athene: what's wrong with 1nt?|pg||
mb|1H|nt|Walddk2: Better than 2@C|pg||
mb|1N|nt|athene: unfortunately for EW, east might be a bit too weak to go stayman so the hearts might be lost|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: When you bid 2@C with a hand like that, there is a risk that you will miss a 4-4 heart fit because advancer is not strong enough to bid|pg||
nt|athene: i guess a fair 7-count is enough facing a 1nt overcall - that's a good 15 up to about 18, isn't it, for most people?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: no time to get the clubs going, but this lead is still very nice for declarer|pg||
nt|patricck: lets face it 4@H wouldn't necessarily have made anyway...delcarer still had to guess the trumps|pg||
nt|athene: no-one ever leads his partner's minor after a 1nt overcall|pg||
nt|athene: you don't even need a stop:) let alone a double stop :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: In my opinion it´s not impossible to ask for majors on E and perhaps play a major contrace on 4-3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: "Partner, I opened 1@D. Next time I'll open 1@S, then perhaps you will lead a diamond"|pg||
nt|lestergold: I think Binky's erropr was actually the worst|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mdgraham: because you can go for a beer afterwards, David - there's a decent pub just round the corner |pg||
nt|lestergold: altho Gunnar got more things wrong|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|davidstern: Ah you chose the one and only AUstralian who doesnt drink|pg||
nt|vugraphzcu: Binky and Heather had a carding discussion after the hand - maybe there was more on the pervious hand than met the eye|pg||
pc|s9|nt|athene: i have a lot of sympathy for north - i think his lead would be the majority choice|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|d2|nt|patricck: your partners respond well to sarcasm Roland? :)|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d8|nt|athene: usually south has a weak notrump and spades works out a lot better than diamonds|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not when 1@D shows 4+ as it does for this N-S pair|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
pc|c4|nt|davidstern: Yes clearly count in clubs|pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: sure, diamonds are more of a real suit than clubs, by a long way|pg||

mb|d|mb|p|nt|athene: interesting to see that NS have adopted a vaguely specialised defence to the loose 1@C opener|pg||
nt|athene: since 1@C might not be clubs, i suppose it's fair that double might not be takeout of clubs :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzcu: W: "they play a lot of kit for people their age"|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@C acceptance|pg||
nt|lestergold: Binky isnt even considering the possibility of playing in spades bearing in mind that on a good day 4S might even be on|pg||

pc|d3|pg||
pc|d6|nt|Walddk2: Once East passes, E-W are out of it because a 5-card major system dictates South to bid 3@S. Simpson did not have that option as N-S here play 4-card majors|pg||
nt|athene: the bidding would all have gone the same way, for example, if west had the @CK|pg||
nt|patricck: If partner was weaker so you just pushed them up one level to 3@S why would you want to tell him to lead a @C?|pg||
nt|davidstern: There are certain words on VG that I check twice before pressing the send key|pg||

mb|2C!|mb|p|mb|2D!|nt|Walddk2: Our gratitude to TGR's Bridge Club for bringing this event to BBO vugraph. Nick Sandqvist has been instrumental in setting up a fine show|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: this is a good example of how, when partner pre-empts and you have a very weak hand with a big fit, just bidding 4 can be more destructive than bidding 5|pg||
mb|3N|nt|sybarra: puppet auction coming up? |pg||
nt|davidstern: What would a 2NT opening bid be?|pg||
nt|peachy: i think he upgraded|pg||
nt|davidstern: 6NT plays like a pianola|pg||
nt|davidstern: I wish he was the checkin clerk at my airline if he upgrades that|pg||
nt|lestergold: but as a percentage slam it barely evenqualies for a roland slam|pg||
nt|vugraphzcu: needs a few things right doesn't it?!|pg||
nt|davidstern: EVERYTHING wualifies for a Roland slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: the point is, if you bid 5, and last player bids 5 over you, that shows a decent hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: but if you bd just 4, and they bid 4 of a major over it, that can be anything|pg||
nt|athene: because people will bid 4 of a major far more freely than 5|pg||
mb|p|pc|hJ|nt|davidstern: Just hearts 3-03 with king onside nothing else|pg||
pc|h7|nt|lestergold: including which finesse to take the club or the spade finesse|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hA|pg||
pc|s8|nt|Walddk2: After Simpson has shown no ace, I think he could bid 6@D over 5NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzcu: Apparently has shown 1 keycard|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Partner made a grand slam try opposite no ace. Come on, show him something|pg||
nt|athene: 5@C must have shown one keycard|pg||
nt|vugraphzcu: Curiously|pg||
nt|athene: since 5nt was a grand slam try|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Isn´t 7@c possible on 5nt?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|lestergold: for the twelth trick that is|pg||
nt|davidstern: OH and no bad diamond break of course|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sybarra: looks like straight stayman auction |pg||
nt|lestergold: and hearts playing for three tricks providing you play the winning option and not double finesse|pg||
nt|lestergold: no its a horrible slam|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|patricck: looks like Hinden may have come back from 25-0 down at the half, but there are still 3 boards to score in the other room|pg||
nt|davidstern: So we agree qualifies for Roland|pg||
nt|sybarra: sure it isnt too good for R?|pg||
nt|lestergold: im not sure it m,ay well be below 12.85% |pg||
pc|c2|pc|c8|nt|athene: south is a little worried about his weak trumps and lack of keycard|pg||
pc|cT|nt|lestergold: you start off with below 50 for diamonds behaving then you have to calculate a massive cut for hearts not playing for three tricks then factor in the black suit finesse position ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: pretty decimated percentage|pg||
nt|davidstern: I really dont think this is worth my brainpower let's just say it is a sheit slam|pg||
nt|vugraphzcu: not to mention a shortage of entries to try things from dummy|pg||
nt|lestergold: give it to Henry Bethe he wil give you a percentage to three decimla places in ca split second|pg||
nt|lestergold: you wont ever bother to check if he is right|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|h2|nt|Walddk2: Oh, did he show one by mistake?|pg||
nt|athene: i think if you have already shown one more ace than you have, you tend not to co-operate with grand slam tries :)|pg||
nt|athene: i assume he took a view and showed one deliberately|pg||
nt|vugraphzcu: Colin saying that he lied about his keycards|pg||
nt|athene: just hoping his partner didn't have the @DA|pg||
pc|hK|nt|Walddk2: Thanks all and good night|pg||

nt|lestergold: but declarer has time to develop  long spade|pg||
pc|d9|nt|athene: (4-5-4-0 good hand)|pg||

pc|dK|nt|mdgraham: can set up a long spade even without a ruff|pg||

nt|Walddk2: I think 3@H is better over 2NT; then he'll get the club cue bid he is looking for|pg||
nt|patricck: agreed Roland|pg||
nt|athene: these advance cue-bids are very dodgy - in my experience partner never knows what is going on - but here it worked out ok|pg||
nt|athene: south might just decide to bash in the slam over 2@H - the point being, you will make it even if you are off @CAK, a lot of the time|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|athene: a spec suggests that 2@H agrees hearts so it's easy from there|pg||
nt|patricck: It is a reasonable slam, although one that might easily go down on some days.....with the magic @C position of course today it doesn't really matter what declarer chooses to play ...|pg||
nt|patricck: for he will be alright|pg||
nt|athene: but the point is, south might have various strong hand without five hearts, for 2@D|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|an|15-17|mb|p|nt|athene: interesting... 1@D rather than some red-suit bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ralfwil: 12 tricks after a @h lead and 11 after a @d lead|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|athene: i mean 1@D rather than some bid showing a 2-suiter|pg||

pc|d4|nt|athene: ok, i suppose you might argue that north doesn't really have so much in reserve, but i just sort of expected him to bid four on this sequence|pg||

nt|davidstern: FIve is a strong result on this hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzcu: yes could easily lose a diamond trick as well as 2 trumps|pg||
nt|davidstern: yep|pg||
nt|davidstern: I would mark it as a 90% matchpoint score|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hK|nt|patricck: was expecting more action than that.....wondering if EW would take their sacrifice, not whether NS would bid their game|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h5|pg||
nt|athene: jump raising to 3 of a major usually means "bid game unless you actually psyched your response"|pg||

nt|athene: well, a chance for Hinden|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I don´t know if I shall blame N or S....:)|pg||
nt|po-s: no but the king is good enough to throw one diamond on|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|athene: slam for EW here|pg||

nt|ralfwil: Is it Willie Coyle as N?|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|athene: ok, fair enough|pg||
nt|athene: 3-level pre-empts in these positions can lead to a lot of missed slams|pg||

nt|athene: because responder has to bid 3nt on a really wide range of hands |pg||
nt|lestergold: hm 3H by North i think i would have preferred to take my chances defending with only one trick to contribute offensively|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d2|nt|athene: and opener tends to pass unless he has a real freak|pg||
nt|patricck: Not really much else you can do as East...you have a little in reserve for your 3NT bid, but what else can you do?|pg||
