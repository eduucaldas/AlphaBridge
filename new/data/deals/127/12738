mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk3: In the other room, the 1@H response showed spades. N-S in this room do not play transfer responses to 1@C|pg||
nt|dburn: same contract in both rooms - by the same side|pg||
pc|d8|nt|Walddk3: which, by the way, are becoming increasingly popular worldwide|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not sure if that helped or hindered roland--would fancy having to play 1NT as North |pg||
nt|ady: east decided on a neutral lead|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dT|pc|dA|pg||
nt|dburn: very much the style these days to lead passively against 1NT|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d7|pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|garnetts: surely a club looks right now?|pg||
nt|dburn: probably didn't matter much what he led - the defence has eight tricks on almost all imaginable lines|pg||
nt|ady: looks likekly -2 for a flat board|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pc|s2|pg||
nt|dburn: still, if that lead happened to be from @d8753, declarer might regret not having unblocked the six of diamonds|pg||
nt|garnetts: just as well he didn't then  lol|pg||
nt|dburn: not that East should play the seven on the second round, of course, but if he was intent on signalling for spades...|pg||
nt|dburn: now, he had better not do something manic like shifting to @hK|pg||
nt|ady: lack of a club switch with 2 small in dummy shoud mean east can switch to a club  where west should have at least one high card|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dK|pc|d3|pc|d6|pg||
pc|d4|nt|dburn: another diamond is also OK, to remove the late entry to the spades|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ady: east remains neutral|pg||
pc|c7|pc|s7|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s4|pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
pc|hK|nt|dburn: nor should he have won that trick - the defence may not get @hK now|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|pc|hA|pg||
pc|s6|nt|garnetts: you can take this passivity too far |pg||
pc|s3|pc|sT|pc|c3|pg||
pc|s9|pc|h6|nt|dburn: oh, well - he was leaving it for a round before doing something manic|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|nt|dburn: but West's discard of @c3 may not have helped much - don't know what signals they are playing, but whatever they were, they didn't work|pg||
nt|garnetts: lol|pg||
nt|Walddk3: The Junior Camrose series, initially for those under 27, but now for those under 25, was launched in September 1971 in Glasgow. Scotland won. Members of that team, Sandy Duncan, ...|pg||

nt|garnetts: South will not enjoy this |pg||
pc|hK|nt|dburn: this auction was rather shorter - that is a pretty lopsided weak 2@d, but still...|pg||
nt|garnetts: I agree--bad suit good defence |pg||
nt|garnetts: I think that too defensive a hand causes partner to misjudge too often as well |pg||
nt|dburn: declarer will need to play this pretty well to get out for down only two, but that will still be 11 IMPs or so to England|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hT|pc|h9|pg||
nt|ady: should keep to down 1    but nothing on for e/w|pg||
nt|dburn: somewhat harsh - 2@d was not great, but it wasn't the worst crime ever committed at  the bridge table|pg||
nt|dburn: down one? how will he manage that? down three looks a more lively possibility|pg||
nt|ady: certainly dont need to play well for down 2|pg||

mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|d|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|asnuttyas: I would much rather come in the 1st round at the 1 level before opps have found their fit / misfit|pg||
pc|d8|nt|paulg:  yes, the opponents have exchanged a lot of information to come in at that point on such a weak suit|pg||
nt|asnuttyas: It just asks for -500 on a part score hand|pg||

pc|c6|pc|c5|pc|cA|pc|cJ|pg||

pc|c2|nt|ady: same side playing 1NT again|pg||
nt|Walddk3: I agree with Morgan's pass over the weak NT, but I know some would double. He has no attractive lead|pg||
nt|garnetts: Many a  South would have rolled the dice --not sure its right though|pg||
nt|dburn: but it is a serious mistake not to double with those South cards|pg||
nt|dburn: facing a passed partner there is more case for going quietly, but still not much - they will steal from you all day if you do that|pg||

nt|dburn: I prefer not to pass when I know I have the best hand at the table|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|garnetts: They will I agree--but I think that double over 1NT should say I have a decent lead --whereas double under it is partners lead and this hand becomes more suitable |pg||

nt|vugraphzdj: This match is quite tense. The two favourites for the event, evenly matched in the pre-tournament betting. Both know that a big start will put th other under a lot of pressure.|pg||
nt|garnetts: North can switch to the K@S to avoid ambiguity when he gets in |pg||
nt|ady: defence should manage now    looks like flat result|pg||
nt|dburn: the point is that partner does not have to pass 1NT doubled - better that he should play some part score if he has a long suit than that we should have to concentrate like demons ...|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c7|pc|c2|pg||

pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
nt|garnetts: The pass of 2@H is confusing  me though--why shouldn't South have 3?  |pg||
nt|Walddk3: They also have a habit of letting the same team stealing the contracts at both tables. Third time it happened in this set|pg||
nt|dburn: perhaps with 3-3 in the majors South is supposed to try to play in the minor first|pg||
nt|dburn: since North more likely to have 4-5 than 5-4 in the major-minor|pg||
nt|garnetts: Call me whatever youy like --but I would not play this convention over a weak notrump and even if I did I would pass the North hand |pg||

nt|garnetts: what with three Davids and two Chris Owens we will get even more confused --Good morning David|pg||
nt|vugraphzdj: 4S explained as mild slam try|pg||
nt|Walddk3: We have 21 Davids on the panel|pg||
nt|ady: good morning|pg||
nt|garnetts: Now West knows 5@C is a waste of breath--East cannot cooperate with an aceless hand |pg||
nt|Walddk3: Not sure what 5@C could achieve when Atthey knows partner is aceless|pg||
nt|dburn: perhaps East could have bid 5@h, but if partner makes any form of slam try and you have four aces, you should not really need him to make another one before you bid a slam|pg||

nt|garnetts: well one of my ex parters used to say if partner makes a slam try and you have the AK of trumps bid one--we can extend that to holding 4  aces |pg||
