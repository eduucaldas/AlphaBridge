nt|sssvablue: Stripe tailed double?|pg||

nt|jtr: Surely he wont redouble?|pg||
nt|sssvablue: Of course I have partners who make striped tailed doubles in the balancing seat|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Weichsel is probably tempted to redouble, but that will let Stewart run|pg||
nt|jtr: 7@h now would be an amusing bid lol|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Weichsel should not redouble, he doesn't want them to run|pg||

nt|sssvablue: I believe by partnership agreement they just make the next available bid|pg||
mb|3N!|mb|p|nt|reisig: They just want to avoid having Russ play any @d contract|pg||
nt|gosia: level too low for double|pg||
nt|sssvablue: why scare them away from nt?|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: I'm told that Ekeblad has shown 4@s, 5@c and 2 small red doubletons|pg||
nt|Vugraphu5: that is correct|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: What? Ekeblad skipped 3@H and 3@S!|pg||
mb|p|nt|sssvablue: That seems intuitively obvious from the bidding :)|pg||
nt|gosia: Peter hoping for 4-4 @h's|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Ekeblad showed 5422 with two small doubletons in red suits. Thanks to Pam Granovetter|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: This is where NOT making the lead directing double pays off :)|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h4|nt|sssvablue: except if you have to double to tell yourself what to lead |pg||
