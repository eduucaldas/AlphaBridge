nt|daman: leading to selsct USA 1|pg||
nt|jstokes: Hi Doc, Hans|pg||
mb|1D|nt|lestergold: not want Welland wants to hear|pg||
nt|haans: natural bidding by both pairs|pg||
nt|lestergold: a non vul wjs|pg||
nt|lestergold: at least it will warn him off game|pg||
nt|cherdano:  quite a powerful hand for a weak 2|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: hello all  |pg||
nt|lestergold: exciting hnad but this will be a push|pg||
nt|joest: hi all|pg||
nt|daman: hey Jack|pg||
nt|panja: hi all|pg||
nt|daman: hi Panja|pg||
nt|daman: wonder if South will bid 3@C|pg||
nt|joest: i think that is a good lead directing effort|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sybarra: welcome back to Whilte Plains NY |pg||
mb|2C|nt|raghavan: If opp miss taking C it will disappear making 5 |pg||
nt|cindy:  hi all|pg||
nt|raghavan: making 6|pg||
nt|lestergold: will make 5 |pg||
nt|daman: hoping partner has a decent @S suit|pg||
nt|daman: McCabe Adjunct|pg||
nt|joest: would you boost to game as east?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|lestergold: should make the 8 spades is an enormous card|pg||
nt|daman: they tend to have the goods when they open a weak 2 in first seat|pg||
nt|cherdano:  well apparently Weinstein also thinks he has extras|pg||
nt|haans: 9 hcp good body 3nt close?|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: hi shirley. should i be moe or larry? wait, wrong trio, sorry|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: Willie here again. Hi to all and enjoy.|pg||
nt|sybarra: hi Willie :) |pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi willie & shirley & specs|pg||
nt|marlowepi: fortunately, Michael is a far better player than speller (see his profile card)|pg||
nt|sybarra: Willie will fix |pg||
nt|daman: the hesitation is not with North I suspect|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: same lead in the other room,  |pg||
nt|marlowepi: thx willie|pg||
nt|sybarra: both N's provided a good lead director  (just kidding)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: sorry about that..was in a hurry and started a bit late; needed to catch up.|pg||
nt|onebid: ask you know who - Bart said all|pg||
nt|daman: volunteering a minus|pg||
nt|daman: Robinson will figure East has a 2 suiter for his bidding and will give his partner a couple of ruffs|pg||
nt|cherdano:  so this should be -2|pg||
nt|daman: I suspect so|pg||
nt|jstokes: now should be easy to reach the making 3N|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: hi judy|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: EW play a 2/1 with Strong NT and NS play a Strong @c and 14-16/15-17 NT|pg||
pc|d3|nt|joest: close call nv knowing a club lead is coming|pg||
nt|daman: difficult not to boost once partner bids|pg||
nt|raghavan: Texas transfer  4D to 4H|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I do´nt like this transfer. why not check 3nt?|pg||
nt|jstokes: 4@H is ok as well|pg||
nt|haans: looks like a make|pg||
nt|ralfwil: -1 with a @c lead|pg||
nt|haans: soon on nt basis|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: NS's CC: http://usbf.org/index2.php?option=com_teamforms&task=display&pop=1&page=0&fid=407&pid=111|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: EW's CC: http://usbf.org/index2.php?option=com_teamforms&task=display&pop=1&page=0&fid=567&pid=109|pg||
pc|d9|nt|marlowepi: np, just kidding|pg||
nt|joest: after two high clubs and a low one, garner has a problem|pg||
nt|haans: singel|pg||
nt|raghavan: difficulty-2S +1D+1club losers|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: This doesn't have much play, 1@s 2@h and at least 1@c loser|pg||
pc|d8|nt|panja: ruff high, finesse @D, back with a trump, another finesse..if the third club is high|pg||
nt|panja: @h at trick two might give decl more trouble|pg||
nt|joest: right you need to know if diamond king onside|pg||
nt|panja: well, you hope..|pg||
nt|joest: a trump on the go might have been better but who would not lead partner's lead director?|pg||
nt|joest: true|pg||
nt|daman: bad for partnership morale if you do that|pg||
nt|panja: well...N has @S and @D, partner bid Clubs, why not a trump lead?|pg||
nt|joest: just pointed out ot me that if AKQ of clubs on the right and rho is a passed hand, then diamond king must be on|pg||
nt|joest: Woolsey on his way to one down in 4@h in the open room if I read the position right|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|lestergold: three spades and a bullet for n/s thats all|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Cohen's 8@d is Suit Preference for @h|pg||
pc|s4|nt|raghavan: Judy, cindy|pg||
nt|haans: do you agree with that bidding?|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sK|pc|s2|pg||
nt|xenya: not a happy contract|pg||
nt|xenya: W responded on minimum values and E overbid a little|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|raghavan: If he plays D, he will get ruff|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dA|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|jstokes: yes, the ruff now will beat it --and there you go|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Yes, and the 6-1@d split will really doom this|pg||
pc|hT|nt|cindy:  hi all|pg||
nt|joest: i guess panja b/c these things are easier to see looking at all four hands than in real life: plus the chance  a third round of clubs might bring your @h10 into play|pg||
nt|panja: @S and @D he is looking at, @C bid he heard...nothing based on all four hands|pg||
nt|panja: this is not one of those things that is a double dummy idea|pg||
pc|h5|nt|marlowepi: some specs may question the TO double, but NS probably play the style of "equal level conversion", which means that S can double and then bid diamonds without showing a great hand|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h2|pg||
nt|raghavan: yes along predicted line|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Since this is USA2, the losers of this match are out, and the Winners will advance to play the winners of the Nickell-Jacobs match|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hA|nt|xenya: on almost any split , he must lose a trump, 2 @Hs and a club|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|pg||
nt|xenya: as it is, BC will do well to get out for down 2|pg||
pc|s9|nt|panja: still, it is just an idea, I am not suggesting that @C lead is wrong, just that trump thought is possible|pg||
nt|joest: diamond hook and club ruff|pg||
nt|daman: meckwell are in 4@S doubled with the NS cards|pg||
nt|joest: 10 possible imps for Welland|pg||
nt|joest: cannot affor to cash anothe trump because after ruffing a diamond and ruffing a club you would have to fatally tap dummy to return|pg||
nt|joest: hook the diamond, ruff a club|pg||
nt|daman: he has a count on North's hand pretty well|pg||
nt|joest: then ace of spades ruff a spade|pg||
nt|daman: unless he falscarded in trumps|pg||
nt|joest: then a low diamond|pg||
pc|sT|nt|mtvesuvius: The loser of the Fleisher-Robinson match will get another chance also... They would play the winner of the winner of this match vs the winner of the other USA2 match... It's a ...|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: whole complicated mess really :)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|cherdano:  so due to the @DQ play, East escaped for -1|pg||
nt|daman: yep|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|h8|nt|joest: i think that works|pg||
nt|daman: yes|pg||
nt|daman: tough hand|pg||
nt|joest: but at some point he will need to duck a diamond|pg||
nt|panja: so, essentially, secure low ruffs and then duck a Diamond...|pg||
nt|joest: at this point he could ruff a spade|pg||
nt|joest: ruff a club|pg||
nt|panja: but then, could @HT be a falsecard?|pg||
nt|daman: unlikely|pg||
nt|joest: then duck the diamond|pg||
nt|joest: that is pretty could stroking |pg||
nt|joest: good|pg||
nt|joest: I think garner is playing the ten as a true card or he wouldn't be taking this long|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hQ|pc|h6|pg||
nt|panja: but then, even if @HT is a falsecard, @D would be 33 in that case, @C ruff, @SA and ruff and then small @D is good|pg||

nt|raghavan: Intesting hans are up Mike?|pg||
nt|lestergold: basically a 50% non vul slam|pg||
nt|pbundy: Hi Roland - specs|pg||
nt|pbundy: I just came from a photographic journey to white plains - MUCH excitement there, as you can imagine|pg||
nt|raghavan: Hans I do not agree with bidding|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: All the Cohens get confusing here|pg||
nt|xenya: a small consolation is that 3@S also fails -- and it's not easy to stop lower|pg||
mb|2N|nt|onebid: Hi everyone - I'll stay until another commentator shows up|pg||
nt|lestergold: welcome Judy|pg||
nt|onebid: Hi Cindy, Dr. R|pg||
nt|raghavan: Ok Judy |pg||
nt|daman: West passed in the OR|pg||
nt|haans: nope dont understand it|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 4@s is a good contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: a swing possibility then|pg||
nt|cindy:  im sure they have a way to show both majors   4@d perhaps|pg||
nt|dcbutler: hi peg|pg||
nt|lestergold: Hi Peg|pg||
nt|pbundy: Hi Dave - Hi Mike|pg||
nt|lestergold: roland slam here|pg||
nt|jstokes: not hard to envision a hand with weaker spades where 4@H is right -- not this hand, however|pg||
nt|raghavan: He could have bid transfer to H and bid 3NT which W will leave and make|pg||
nt|ralfwil: or check so partner can show his @s|pg||
nt|haans: direct 4@S now|pg||
nt|haans: maybe a little to strong|pg||
nt|jstokes: way too strong for me|pg||
mb|3C|nt|lestergold: 3dims does the job|pg||
nt|cindy:  many use 3@d to ask for a @d stopper|pg||
nt|onebid: maybe 4@D a bit of a push at equal non-vul?|pg||
nt|cindy:  with a long club suit|pg||
nt|daman: I think they play Flannery|pg||
nt|joest: I can attest that east-west LOVE 2@d openers|pg||
nt|joest: this is a transfer to 3@c|pg||
nt|joest: either a lead director or about to play it in clubs|pg||
nt|raghavan: no his hand is power house after P openshe will go slow |pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree Hans - with 2 kings and a singleton @c|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Yes, and that is where they are playing in the OR|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: transfer to spades - I|pg||
mb|3D|nt|cindy:  pretty good hand|pg||
nt|onebid: I do Cindy|pg||
nt|joest: Wildavsky can bid a 'direct' or 'delayed' 3@h|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 2NT is 21-22|pg||
mb|p|nt|pbundy: this is how i generally handle my nine card suits|pg||
nt|lestergold: only needs club finesse and dim q dropping too good for roland but too bad for these nasty cards|pg||
mb|3N|nt|lestergold: every reason to make a try |pg||
nt|lestergold: even game is off|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: I prefer a 4@c - cue|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: good forward going|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Cindy|pg||
nt|cindy:  hi :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: now ahe know a finesse at worst |pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy:  on their way|pg||
nt|haans: 4@D mantatory|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: and I would assume Berkowitz upgraded :)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|daman: seems reasonable|pg||
nt|jstokes: Willenken cooperating but he has a really awful hand for spades|pg||
nt|xenya: and rightly so|pg||
pc|d3|nt|panja: without any ace, the double is a bit too light|pg||
pc|dT|nt|lestergold: yep hes got lucky!|pg||
nt|onebid: or could have had K@S and no aces|pg||
nt|cindy:  im a big believer in leading aces vs small slams|pg||
nt|lestergold: the 4d bid was pointless by west|pg||
nt|onebid: agree Mike|pg||
nt|lestergold: only helped them on their way|pg||
nt|cindy:  spec points out they heard that yesterday :-)|pg||
nt|onebid: I meant K trump|pg||
nt|cindy:  would think W wouldnt bid 4@d unless he wanted the lead|pg||
nt|raghavan: Only way is to finesse S - It succeeds here|pg||
nt|joest: but let me ask you this: if it went 3@d pass pass back to you would you be happy you'd passed?|pg||
nt|joest: if Weinstein goes up ace, Wildavsky may drop the queen|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|raghavan: E wants a Spade lead ? Mike|pg||
nt|xenya: by contrast, this plays pretty well|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|nt|cindy:  at least they have the fear factor in their favor|pg||
nt|lestergold: cant blame west for bnidding it and will probabbly be a push |pg||
pc|hA|nt|onebid: preempts exist to make it harder for opponents. Most of the time the damage is done - why get involved. Might push them to slam|pg||
nt|joest: or not|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W might have ruffed with a higher heart|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4d wa never gonna take up much spade only encourages them |pg||
nt|ralfwil: But I hadn´t opened on E....|pg||
pc|c2|nt|panja: not happy, but 200- has to be weighed against a possible game...and the chance of missing it|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lestergold: i handle em as follows i count themand find that there were only eight!|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|raghavan: He cashes seeing D length in dummy|pg||
nt|raghavan: cashes HA|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Yes, and it's worth noting that they don't use puppet here, since I assume that all hands with 5 card majors and that strength are opened with a Strong @c|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c7|pc|cQ|nt|lestergold: space|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|cT|nt|lestergold: frankly 5d is of course enormous in the 70% plus reion|pg||
nt|joest: g-w on track for +200 here|pg||
nt|joest: garner must have the spade ace|pg||
pc|c5|nt|lestergold: not spade|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d7|pg||
nt|cherdano:  South tried to play "safe" in diamonds|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: The @c suit comes in, and Q@H could drop potentially|pg||
pc|c9|nt|pbundy: yes; not a bad buy in dummy|pg||
nt|joest: if Wildavsky had both aces + hearts he would have bid at once|pg||
pc|c6|nt|lestergold: curse my fingers|pg||
nt|pbundy: and - even with the diamonds not breaking, still on a club hook|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|pg||
nt|lestergold: well if he didnt buy something in dummy then north south would have almost certainly had a game|pg||
nt|xenya: for 11th trick|pg||
pc|c8|nt|raghavan: claim time|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: The 2009 USBC will determine which two teams will be representing USA in the Bermuda Bowl to be held in São Paulo, Brazil, in late August and early September|pg||
pc|d6|nt|cindy:  well if N was going to jump to 4@h, 4@d prevents that|pg||
nt|joest: well done|pg||
nt|panja: y, brilliant @S shift|pg||
pc|d5|nt|onebid: mine too Mike:(|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|xenya: he will take a finesse though -- i think|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hQ|pc|h4|pc|h7|pg||
nt|pbundy: absolutely - tho dummy could have had more "stuff" and just have been wrong "stuff"|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|xenya: wrong as usual...|pg||
pc|s3|nt|vdoubleu: .|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h8|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Cohen is almost Squeezed, but since Dummy must play first he won't be|pg||

nt|2hplus4: Why should he suggest @C with that hand VUL v NOT|pg||
nt|bobh1: it is common to play that this double asks for a lead|pg||
nt|bobh1: i think where that agreement exists it would ask for a @s lead not a @d lead|pg||

mb|p|nt|cindy:  hey debbie :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: so i know it well|pg||
nt|panja: B93, 3Nt does not seem to be all that easy...|pg||
mb|2C|nt|sybarra: 2 @C looks like majors |pg||
nt|marlowepi: i am the token male in this event|pg||
nt|daman: I think so too|pg||
mb|p|nt|pbundy: yes - tho i would be slightly tempted to open this hand 1@D rather than 1NT|pg||
mb|3C|nt|lestergold: 4h i agree at this vul|pg||
nt|raghavan: Deal 1 = In open room, EW stopped in 3H making so 5 IMP|pg||
mb|p|nt|pbundy: some chance of missing a major suit game if partner has 7 or 8 and passes 1NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: even double dummy clubs lead cant dent it|pg||
nt|dcbutler: problem is that gets you to 2N opposite pard's 6 count with no major|pg||
nt|lestergold: however probably will only make it on the nose|pg||
nt|pbundy: that is true|pg||
mb|p|nt|debrose: Presumably 2@C shows majors.  I  recommend using a defenses to 1N which include 2@C for majors, rather than 2@D or 2@H as so many do|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: what's the advantage of using 2C for the majors?|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5h only costs 500|pg||
nt|lestergold: but west has some defence|pg||
nt|onebid: and a flat hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5s now  cold|pg||
nt|raghavan: CQ falls|pg||
mb|p|nt|debrose: This allows advancer to bid 2@D with equal length in the majors to allow overcaller to bid the longer suit (or stronger with equal length)|pg||
nt|panja: @s9 might be the best lead|pg||
nt|cherdano:  East has strong desire to suggest NT with this hand|pg||
nt|cherdano:  and West is obviously fine with that, having supported with 3@S|pg||
nt|xenya: 5@C might make here but it's too much to ask for|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: EW usually open soundly, and so if you see agressive bidding later in the auction, that is the reason|pg||
nt|xenya: i mean getting there|pg||
pc|dA|nt|joest: nice spade spots for Doub|pg||
nt|joest: eventually it's hearts, his apparently weakest suit, that will ride to his rescue|pg||
nt|daman: this is the best spot|pg||
nt|cherdano:  meanwhile the lead is down to 23 IMPs|pg||
nt|daman: EW are chipping away|pg||
nt|cherdano:  looks like it comes down to the spade guess |pg||
nt|haans: so they did also find hearts :)|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Getting to 5@s would take some serious overbidding|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 5@c*|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lestergold: or heart sets up for club discard in any case|pg||
nt|onebid: hard to see any other result|pg||
nt|raghavan: yes Hans|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d4|pg||
nt|lestergold: and another way of avoidin g a club loser!!|pg||
nt|panja: the best @C play should AK and back..but that will lose badly here..but what else is available?|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
pc|s7|nt|daman: exactly|pg||
pc|s3|nt|onebid: kibs can check movie to see how OR made 4|pg||
pc|sK|nt|marlowepi: of course, if opponents get wise to all that they may just stop opening 1NT :)|pg||
nt|debrose: I'll live with that:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: when Michael gets in, play a spade.|pg||
nt|debrose: Perhaps a question I get asked more than any other from my bridge students is whether to open 1 of a major or 1N with a balanced hand of the right strength|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|joest: plenty of time to play clubs later|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|lestergold: 15-17 no trump south cannto upgrade the hand is maxi but nothying to upgrade and yes occasionally u miss a good major game but not often|pg||
nt|joest: seems to me that Garner has little choice but to play back a heart|pg||
nt|daman: cannot go wrong|pg||
nt|cherdano:  yes|pg||
nt|cherdano:  he didnt duck because he was afraid of a @H switch|pg||
pc|c2|pc|s4|pc|s5|pg||
nt|debrose: There are many factors to consider, but I usually open 1N, and I think you'll observe most top level players tend to do so|pg||
nt|debrose: Rosenberg's hand is perhaps the clearest type to open 1N with - the rebid problem over 1@H/1@S is just impossible|pg||
nt|debrose: With 17 pts. one might overbid 2N, and with 15 might underbid 1N.  So with hearts and 16 HCP there is the most reason to open 1N|pg||
pc|c5|nt|haans: they must agreed on that before bidding :)|pg||
nt|haans: bud in my mind 4@S is a little odd|pg||
nt|raghavan: playing SJ will avoid OT|pg||
nt|raghavan: yes  fit for invitation|pg||
pc|c3|nt|daman: this is going to roll home    Weinstein just doesn't know it|pg||
pc|cA|nt|pbundy: i once had a partner who rarely opened 1NT with both (decent) majors.  particularly at matchpoints, he had the belief that missing major suit fits cost tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: u open a diamond and ebid 2n and u often over reach urself|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|panja: @s8 will surely be covered with the T..and that would endplay Garner|pg||
nt|panja: 8 tricks on top now, Declarer needs only one|pg||
nt|cherdano:  @S8? really?|pg||
nt|daman: @S 8 was strange|pg||
pc|c4|nt|cherdano:  not really - |pg||
pc|cT|nt|lestergold: it has its points Peg|pg||
nt|pbundy: well; in theory, if you open 1@D, some fair amount of the time partner will respond in a major|pg||
nt|lestergold: ur view|pg||
nt|pbundy: oh - not even "my" view ... "a" view|pg||
pc|cK|nt|debrose: Of course we'd rather have an stronger doubleton, but such is life.  These days I see a lot of experts opening 1N with a five card major AND two doubletons.   |pg||
nt|marlowepi: in my methods i don;t get dealt that hand. or else i just open 1NT whenever it looks like 1NT. somehow it seems to work out|pg||
nt|pbundy: the ten of diamonds and 9 of spades might sway me on this one|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if i get dealt the rpoblem hand, i say i only have 12 cards. chance of a redeal giving me similar hand is infinitesimal|pg||
nt|raghavan: curtains - made 5|pg||
pc|h3|nt|debrose: I like methods which allow one to choose which hands to be dealt.  Can you send me your system notes please Marshall?|pg||
nt|lestergold: a virwe im sure shared yes|pg||
nt|jstokes: prob with inviting here is that it all depends on the fit; if partner has little in clubs, you want to be in game; vul, I think just bid it|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hQ|pc|h5|pg||

nt|Vugraphu6: Katz failed to alert 1H as spades...there is discussion|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Is E not worth 3@S knowing partner is short in @H|pg||
nt|2hplus4: Perhaps that explains it|pg||
nt|bobh1: people who play transfer responses to 1@c usually do play 1@h=@ss here|pg||
nt|bobh1: double is @hs and 2@s is often both majors, like a neg double|pg||
nt|bobh1: i'm sorry 1@s is both majors|pg||

nt|Walddk5: most don't. Open one browser window per table|pg||
mb|p|nt|debrose: While generally I tend to be more interested in the cardplay than the bidding, I find I often can't think straight when Michael's in a close match|pg||
nt|joest: we'll see if Wildavsky opens light |pg||
nt|joest: and keeps his opponents out of spades|pg||
nt|panja: EW might pick up a partial swing here|pg||
mb|1H|nt|debrose: So I'll just see Cindy say good def and take her word for it :)|pg||
nt|cindy:  it was :)|pg||
nt|cindy:  this is a good 2@s bid too debbie :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: but 5d an excellent save even at this vulnerability|pg||
nt|pbundy: yes it is, mike|pg||
nt|ralfwil: for me 2nt on E is showing a hand with 4-card support and defensive values|pg||
nt|haans: 4@H in no time and then what?|pg||
nt|raghavan: in theory,EW has game in H let us see|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: is 1n an upgrade?|pg||

nt|lestergold: at this vul he might well|pg||
nt|lestergold: not much risk|pg||
mb|1S|nt|lestergold: but also it wont stop e/w either|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/w can make 5 of course as spade and club finesses both right|pg||
nt|dcbutler: in the two USA2 round of 16 matches, Jacobs leads Cohler by 18 and Strull leads Oxdil by 2 after one of four segments |pg||
nt|pbundy: except for fleischer/nickell match, all pretty exciting|pg||
nt|lestergold: but i dont thin k south will get too excited with his q  two jacks and no singleton|pg||
nt|pbundy: and, needless to say, i would never count out the nickell team|pg||
nt|lestergold: i wouldnt count out any team who reached this semi final|pg||
nt|pbundy: all of us have seen that team overcome enormous deficits|pg||
nt|cherdano:  light opening|pg||
nt|daman: if you look at the play in the other room...the @S* cost an IMP|pg||
nt|daman: @S8|pg||
nt|henryb: they are opening the bidding lighter and lighter|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: has made it awkward tho|pg||
nt|onebid: 4@H needs some play|pg||
nt|joest: so the auction from the open will be duplicated|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Val Westheimer|pg||
mb|3S|nt|lestergold: i think boyd will plead 5th ammendment and remain silent|pg||
nt|dcbutler: EW play a lot of transfers, here 2D shows hearts|pg||
nt|lestergold: no im wrong|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: 8 was to the best i cud see|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Hi all:-)|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: Yes Mike may prevent EW reaching Hgame|pg||

nt|mtvesuvius: Hi Val :)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|haans: no chance for cross ruff|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Val|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy:  a breather hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: the hearts unlucky but the club finesse onm so will only lose 2h an a spade in practice|pg||
nt|raghavan: oh still E bids|pg||
nt|lestergold: so an easy read for welland after all|pg||
nt|lestergold: ride|pg||
nt|lestergold: i meant to type|pg||
nt|cherdano:  yes it seems like the right play|pg||
nt|ralfwil: He was afraid of a better @c contract on EW|pg||
nt|raghavan: Why has not W X this thinking they may go club which he cannot X|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: thanks Steve|pg||
nt|cherdano:  so an undeserved IMP to Robinson :)|pg||
nt|daman: not really undeserved|pg||
mb|p|nt|pbundy: yes - and one of those hands where you cannot go wrong in the play|pg||
nt|panja: all agree with the 2@H choice? anyone for pass?|pg||
nt|daman: deserved|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|lestergold: i dont think so|pg||
nt|lestergold: east too good cant isk missing vul game because opps are playing favourable vulnerability tactcis|pg||
pc|d2|nt|onebid: unlikely S will lead spade - so easier for declarer|pg||
nt|pbundy: as some of my partners would say:  "bundy-proof"|pg||
nt|lestergold: no losing options of course |pg||
nt|dcbutler: hard to sac on this vulnerability|pg||
nt|lestergold: Peg u are too modest for a bridge player |pg||
nt|haans: or @H void |pg||
pc|dA|nt|daman: I see 8 tricks|pg||
nt|henryb: the question on this hand is whether Robinson can eventually endplay Weinstein into giving him his ninth trick|pg||
nt|daman: right Henry|pg||
nt|cherdano:  they play standard carding so East will probably switch|pg||
nt|henryb: since he has eight winners snd threats in both majors, I am sure he can|pg||
nt|daman: he will play @Cs first|pg||
nt|cherdano:  he won't have problems guessing East's shape|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: B. Cohen upgraded his hand for his short @cs, unfortunately that meant that his partners entire hand was wasted|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Good afternoon to Mike Gold|pg||

nt|lestergold: in open south spyched i cee a heart they ignored it|pg||
nt|onebid: no, more likely conventional|pg||
nt|daman: East might play them for him|pg||
pc|d8|nt|pbundy: well; thank you but i see myself ALL the time!|pg||
nt|pbundy: tho i will say i saw an absolute world class player go down in 3nt yesterday with 9 tricks on top|pg||
nt|pbundy: even after the set, he didn't realize he had done it|pg||
pc|d3|nt|pbundy: fatigue and concentration are no small parts of the game|pg||

nt|onebid: I'm easily amused |pg||
nt|onebid: Now you have 3 commentators - off to kibitz:)|pg||
nt|raghavan: Mike N made bid of 2S in OP that means bid of 1H by south is conventional probably transfer to higher suit |pg||

nt|vdoubleu: And Larry was happy to trun down the invite|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: mulit=single major |pg||
nt|cindy:  even then i DONT like it :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: which my guess that was |pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: will find out and let you know ASAP.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the late great Grant Baze had a great website, on which he shared this bit of wisdom:|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: identical auction to the open room|pg||
nt|pef: bad news for ew is that clubs split 5-1, good news is that north doesn't have a spade to ruff with, very tempting for robinson to bid one more here|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: Heart K is favourable so makes|pg||
nt|lestergold: and i  due course the same 4 losers and another pusk|pg||
nt|lestergold: well northcan ruff a club that is if he had a trump --- pity!!|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 4@c is pushing the limit, but the favorable @H situation will help somewhat|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: 3H = mixed raise.|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|cherdano:  assuming 2NT was non-forcing, that is|pg||
nt|daman: and here we are|pg||
nt|daman: I see 9 tricks|pg||
nt|henryb: maybe more since Weinstein is marked with virtually all the highcards|pg||
nt|daman: yes|pg||
pc|s5|nt|lestergold: another no-brainer contract|pg||
nt|pbundy: i myself would be fearful that slam is makeable|pg||
pc|s4|nt|lestergold: makes on many layouts when HK is wronmg too|pg||
nt|lestergold: dm 3/3 or ruffing spade in dummy|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|lestergold: so are they thats why they didnt push to 6h!|pg||
nt|pef: well, he does have an ace, but I agree it's close.|pg||
pc|c3|nt|daman: not a bad advance|pg||
pc|c4|nt|daman: in the meckweel match  both tables were in 3NT  -300|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|cindy:  makes 4 now|pg||
nt|lestergold: now likely make 4|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|lestergold: the acs divided and the heart ace doesnt always stand in these situations|pg||
nt|xenya: this needs some delicate handling|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Yes, very|pg||
nt|xenya: but i think declarer will prevail -- he might as well tale a @H finesse now|pg||
nt|xenya: *take|pg||
pc|dA|nt|marlowepi: he recalled a panel at a Nationals with many experts fielding many questions, and he said he always remembered and came to cherish the answer given by the late great Bobby Goldman ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in answer to this question:|pg||
nt|lestergold: point is north does  not expect to beat 5s but he let them play it|pg||
nt|lestergold: to little uside in bidding on|pg||
nt|lestergold: massive downside|pg||
nt|pef: Not sure if I agree with that.  I think the upside potential is at least close to the downside potential.  give partner a doubleton diamond for example and that's 7 probably imps|pg||
nt|pbundy: to me, part of the problem is what DO you do if they now bid 6?  do you decide that they made an error, and simply defend?  or - have you now pushed them to a slam that will ...|pg||
nt|pbundy: succeed?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|marlowepi: "what is your least favorite convetnion"|pg||
nt|debrose: drumroll....|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lestergold: for an imp drop in the ocean|pg||
nt|cindy:  not that easy to hold to 3|pg||
nt|raghavan: Now should cash S or else|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|panja: playing to drop @CJ or K stiff?|pg||
pc|d8|nt|marlowepi: and bobby said: "any meaning of a constructive 2NT bid that isn;t natural"|pg||
pc|d9|nt|raghavan: he gives S|pg||
pc|dK|nt|cindy:  right|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
pc|d5|nt|cindy:  3 still|pg||
nt|lestergold: last hand wires crossed|pg||
pc|h8|nt|raghavan: claim time|pg||
pc|c2|nt|debrose: That's interesting Marshall.  I believe I play a lot more natural 2N bids than most experts do these days, but do play Lebensohl here|pg||
nt|raghavan: yes|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: At this point the @h has to be on for him to make|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: He might have been afraid that, if the heart finesse were off, extra undertricks.|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h5|nt|debrose: As with so many areas of bidding, the key is being on the same wavelength as partner|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Correct, and it would result in -2 if off I believe|pg||
nt|xenya: well S got into the auction and N is likely to have @C AK as the play went|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h2|pg||
nt|joest: so now down to 25|pg||
nt|henryb: there went one overtrick|pg||
nt|daman: same contract from the other side in the OR   @HJ lead   @D switch|pg||
pc|d6|pc|hT|pc|c7|nt|cindy:   i feel strongly about a lot of things (dont for example :)) but not 2N|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|h6|nt|marlowepi: absolutely.......and then hope that the computer deals the right hands for your methods :)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|debrose: You'll always get hands where you wish you'd agreed to a different meaning, but might survive those.  Having partner pass your artificial bid thinking it was natural is rarely ...|pg||
nt|debrose: pretty|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||
pc|dT|nt|xenya: so @HK seems to be marked with S|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Now the @d gets ruffed and he guarantees his contract|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Good job, careful.|pg||

nt|raghavan: Push|pg||
nt|pef: while it's not impossible you might push them to 6s, I think it's likely that if that pair was going to bid 6 they would have done so already|pg||
nt|joest: appears to be a pretty routine spade game|pg||
nt|daman: Billy Cohen made 3NT in the OR|pg||
nt|xenya: nicely done, yes|pg||
mb|1N|nt|cindy:  skinny 3N at other table|pg||
nt|lestergold: might be a swing here|pg||
nt|lestergold: playersd do not like doing this because if they get it wrong its so expensive that is why robinson preferred to let sleeping dogs lie|pg||
nt|panja: 4@S for NS..should be easy..a likely push|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|pef: well, we'll have to ask him--I bet at least as much of his reasoning was he thought there was a real chance they'd beat 5s, not that he thought 6s was making|pg||
nt|lestergold: not always the case in thesde haviliy competitiv auctions|pg||
nt|pbundy: i have a strong suspicion that east started with @S :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: but north is dealer\??|pg||
nt|pef: you don't think north has a mandatory 1s psych in first seat?|pg||
nt|pbundy: call me crazy - but - |pg||
nt|joest: weinstein will definitely respond 1NT|pg||
nt|joest: ok i give|pg||
nt|daman: uncle|pg||
nt|jstokes: transfer response to 1@C|pg||
nt|raghavan: may bi part score|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: north's weak nt hand and south's hand are not always bid to a game|pg||
nt|pef: another 11 card spade fit for e/w|pg||
nt|lestergold: this isnt the british juniors|pg||
nt|dcbutler: might have worked pretty well on this hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: oops|pg||
mb|2S|nt|joest: would you volunteer 2@s here?|pg||
nt|raghavan: heart by W  shows spade suit|pg||
mb|d|nt|debrose: It is pretty Standard to play this particular negative double as exactly 4-4 in the majors.  |pg||
nt|pbundy: that is quite true, david :)|pg||
nt|pef: so a grand slam on a (failing) club finesse|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2d?? if im coming in give it at least the 3d|pg||
nt|pbundy: i wonder why robinson didn't begin with some   of diamonds?|pg||
nt|pbundy: i guess he preferred the spade psych :) :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: cute|pg||
nt|pef: would have led to an interesting auction|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 6s is against the wall and roland is in 7|pg||
nt|pef: many years ago, when psyching was much more prevalent in high level bridge, people had to develop methods to deal with frequent psychs|pg||
nt|pbundy: a spec informs me that 2@D was precluded by the dreaded flannery|pg||
nt|pef: in fact, we're probably all old enough to remember when the convention card had a place to check "frequent psychs"|pg||
nt|pbundy: that is why 3@D was invented|pg||
nt|pbundy: tho at these colors, that's a little much|pg||
nt|haans: very popular bidding |pg||
nt|xenya: 1N -- 14-16?|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Yes, 14-16 here|pg||
mb|p|nt|debrose: Occasionally it might be 4-5 with a weak hand.  So bidding a major in this auction most definitely does not promise 5|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n probably coming now|pg||
nt|lestergold: altho south is a passed hand|pg||
nt|raghavan: If bid makes with good D and SAQ and K of other suit|pg||
nt|cindy:  N knows S must have very good @ds to come in red|pg||
nt|pef: a little?|pg||
nt|pbundy: part of why i spurn flannery.  |pg||
nt|daman: routine 2@S bid|pg||
mb|3H|nt|lestergold: auction far from over|pg||
nt|pef: you mean so you can open 2d with 4 counts in first seat?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: not a good contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|debrose: Rosenberg is violating the "Law of total tricks" here, because of his honors in partner's first "suit"|pg||
nt|sybarra: in the other room as W opened 1 @D |pg||
nt|debrose: and his three little diamonds tell him partner has at most a doubleton and he has nothing wasted there|pg||
nt|lestergold: 10 imps on the way back toWelland|pg||
nt|cindy:  and a hand not suitable for a preempt   |pg||
nt|lestergold: very different auction in the open room|pg||
nt|lestergold: after this the gap not an unsurmountable 32 or so|pg||
nt|raghavan: Cindy is it unsuitable because of a Major in hand? |pg||
nt|cindy:  it would be for me but I'm told they play 2@d is a 3 suited hand|pg||
nt|cindy:  so 2@d was not an option|pg||
nt|raghavan: oh|pg||
nt|raghavan: Cindy it is only opening 2D it is 3 suiter -|pg||
nt|raghavan: not any overcall|pg||
nt|cindy:  opening 2@d|pg||
nt|raghavan: yes Opening 2D = 4414, etc almost like precision except the short suit can be anyone|pg||
nt|lestergold: i assume opening 2d would deny a 4 card major|pg||
nt|raghavan: need not be singleton D|pg||
nt|lestergold: south cant open that in classical weak 2 stule in front of partner|pg||
nt|raghavan: No their CC says 11-15, 4441, 5440 etc|pg||
nt|raghavan: any shotness|pg||
nt|lestergold: so a different reason but of course he didnt open 2d becasue it would have had a different meaning in their style|pg||
nt|raghavan: It becomes overcall|pg||
nt|henryb: 1@d = 4+ hearts; 1@s denies three @h|pg||
nt|cherdano:  1@S probably shows an unbalanced hand|pg||
nt|daman: 3@C = invitational|pg||
nt|henryb: and promises real clubs|pg||
nt|daman: right|pg||
nt|henryb: Boyd will be okay against all games if he can avoid a @d lead|pg||
nt|cherdano:  they may get to 5@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: what is delay? technical/|pg||
nt|panja: considering dbl could be just 9...I would pass one round, as N|pg||
nt|daman: most of us would bid|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: B. Cohen wasn't too happy to have to make a bid here, let alone declare this|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|joest: in the other room Woolsey did not rebid 2@h.  Cohen double raised Smith's 1@s to 3 and Smith passed|pg||
nt|henryb: I do not think Robinson is trancing|pg||
nt|raghavan: e 5D may be a save of 3 IMP|pg||
nt|raghavan: oh |pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: That lead gives him some options though|pg||
pc|dA|nt|Vugraphu8: adam|pg||
nt|raghavan: stopped in 3S|pg||
nt|haans: 3@S 1 down|pg||
nt|jstokes: and will do well to make 3|pg||
nt|haans: @H9 may help|pg||
nt|ralfwil: looks more like -2 with lack of entries to the table|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Will be happier now, w/non-spade lead|pg||
pc|d3|nt|dcbutler: EW in the other room sold to 5DX on the previos hand, so Welland is within 9 imps|pg||
nt|pef: so much for the "master suit"|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|panja: not unreasonable..|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: David had no reason to lead anything else here.|pg||
pc|d9|nt|lestergold: im not sure i likem the old black here slam would be cold if west's 8 points outside spades were kq of hearts and K of clubs|pg||
nt|cherdano:  now this has a chance|pg||
nt|lestergold: but there are  communication problems|pg||
nt|raghavan: At some time S may be on lead helping declarer|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d4|nt|pef: now trying for a grand slam, asking aobut the k of clubs|pg||
nt|lestergold: what east should have done is make a bid that tells partner he is looking for a cue in hearts or is missing something that he needs from him|pg||
nt|lestergold: roland is egging him on!!|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|debrose: He would not expect his decision to work well when partner had xxx clubs, but that is very much against the odds|pg||
nt|debrose:  perhaps Gary can get out for down one when 3@D was making anyway|pg||
nt|joest: i know I would kick the extra point|pg||
nt|henryb: I think it is cold now|pg||
nt|daman: yes|pg||
nt|daman: on a @H lead he would have to play it wide open|pg||
nt|henryb: @sAK, @s ruff, @dA, @s ruff with @cK, @d and ruff the fourth @d with the trump 9|pg||
nt|xenya: perhaps E's sequence showed just what he had -- strong takeout double|pg||
pc|s6|nt|lestergold: and west now will decline holding xx club|pg||
nt|lestergold: south club switch surel;y dclarer must lose spade 2 clubs 2 hearts|pg||
nt|ralfwil: another @d and it´s up to declarer|pg||
pc|s4|nt|joest: a fifth trump and an ace|pg||
nt|panja: I would think S should bid 2@H first..3@S deemed slightly weaker?|pg||
nt|joest: partner has what he's supposed to have and I'm cold|pg||
pc|sK|nt|lestergold: of course if he doesnt thn a ht will take care of a club loser|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|pef: excellent prediction :)|pg||
nt|dcbutler: probably 5C showed 1 keycard, 5D asked for the Q of trumps, 5H showed it plus the K of hearts|pg||
nt|pef: robinson margin likey now to increase by the whims of fate|pg||
nt|pbundy: note that boyd wisely didn't X clubs to let them know any potential hooks were losing|pg||
nt|pbundy: i would highly doubt they'd be in the grand then|pg||
nt|lestergold: well commentator's curse|pg||
nt|lestergold: but he will regret that he didn listen to my comments!!!!|pg||
nt|pef: something must have come off the wheels there--hard to understand welland 7s call|pg||
nt|raghavan: He needs 2 ruffs of D to improve|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Now Berkowitz has to return a @d to beat this, since Larry would score his T@H then|pg||
nt|xenya: hence the disciplined pass|pg||
pc|d6|nt|vdoubleu: Good play|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Now Larry sees the possibility, and will return the @d... Nice play|pg||
pc|h3|pc|d7|pc|dT|pg||
pc|h4|nt|pbundy: he could have tried 5@H if he still wanted to look|pg||
nt|pbundy: oops; i mean 6@H|pg||

mb|4S|nt|debrose: Of course there is no passive lead with this hand.  A diamond from Txx could easily blow something in that suit|pg||

nt|debrose: How about you Sylvia?|pg||
nt|cherdano:  this might be a swing to Robinson eg if Doub opens 3@S|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|pg||
nt|lestergold: it is a reasonable contract played by west especially|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Cash club first?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|bbramley: i would have led like he did - good old 4th best - 2nd choice is a high club - last choice is any other suit|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: No, then the @c can be pitched on a @d|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Right, he has to cash his @c first :)|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Hard to see that from Ron's perspective|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Yes, he cannot envision the exact play yet I don't think|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Neither can Larry:)))|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: But I thk he will fall into this.|pg||

nt|mtvesuvius: Now anything but a @c return and this makes|pg||
pc|d4|nt|joest: why didn't he work the spades first in case they were 4-2?|pg||
nt|panja: good idea for def now is @D to @DK and small back|pg||
nt|joest: Doub would go up queen|pg||
pc|dT|nt|daman: that would tie his knickers in a knot|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Although it's still a bit double dummy, becuase he lacks entries to his hand :)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|daman: cash the @C Queen to get count from partner|pg||
nt|cherdano:  East is dummy|pg||
nt|daman: :)   really|pg||
nt|daman: then play another @S|pg||
nt|daman: -2 in the OR|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|sT|nt|vdoubleu: Does not need more than 1, because after West ruffs the diamond he will not be able to get partner in.|pg||
pc|h4|nt|bbramley: also a good @S shift - clarifies another suit for his partner|pg||
nt|joest: garner would play the jack if he had it|pg||
nt|panja: he must play @DQ...|pg||
nt|daman: beware of ....bearing gifts|pg||
nt|panja: with J with W, he would have played the J|pg||
nt|joest: a three trick swing here|pg||
nt|daman: up Simba (with apologies to Tarzan)|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s9|pg||
nt|debrose: Yes good point.  Often when defending 1N in particular, knowing you will get in again, it is better to lead something through declarer while you have the chance rather than cashing ...|pg||
nt|debrose: out|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: Neil should have continued spades before clearing the clubs.|pg||
nt|lestergold: maybe 9|pg||
nt|lestergold: now!!|pg||
nt|raghavan: Spade play now|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @c10 is a nice card on W for 3nt on W! on east a @d lead is killing|pg||
nt|xenya: that's an exciting hand :)|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Back to -1 once Larry decided to play for 2-2 trump|pg||
pc|dK|nt|debrose: On some hands that has to be weighed against the potential benefit of forcing declarer to make another pitch|pg||
nt|raghavan: yes 1 IMP|pg||
nt|daman: bravo|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d6|pc|d7|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh 1 imp yes but in the oppositie direction|pg||
nt|raghavan: yes|pg||
nt|lestergold: commentator's curse strikes with a vengeance|pg||
nt|lestergold: !!!lol|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sybarra: now to unblock |pg||
pc|d8|pc|dQ|nt|panja: that is 8 tricks for NS, with just 18 HCP|pg||
nt|joest: nice try by the d tho|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|lestergold: actually  back to the push |pg||
nt|lestergold: well im tird and there are enough of u so i will bid u all good day and take a break very enjoyable and ingteresting session so far|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: It is all so easy for us, seeing all 4 hands.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lestergold: but these cards should have been bid to 3n its a normal vul game|pg||
pc|c7|nt|vdoubleu: We are all so clever:)|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mtvesuvius: It's certainly tougher at the table :)|pg||
mc|9|nt|lestergold: no back to the imp to welland|pg||

nt|bbramley: very unlucky result for N/S in the Closed Room - 6@D is excellent|pg||
nt|lestergold: with west's strength south could hardly hope to play to beat 1!|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4s makeable on finding the dim|pg||
nt|pbundy: painful board on the grand; opponents were only in GAME|pg||
nt|pbundy: so - bidding for 13 instead of 12 was particularly costly.|pg||
nt|dcbutler: amazing how often that happens|pg||
nt|migry: it is often the case that a small slam is enough to win the board|pg||
nt|pbundy: of course - had the finesse worked, we all would have applauded their boldness and good fortune|pg||
nt|joest: will weinstein restrain himself?|pg||
nt|joest: I'm telling you they LOVE 2@d|pg||
nt|xenya: as Adam pointed out, communications were a problem for declarer, if he wanted to ruff a @H|pg||
mb|3H|nt|lestergold: and 4s not a bad contract here frankly|pg||
nt|joest: you have to know your customers :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6c looks makeable|pg||
mb|3N|nt|sybarra: 2 @S=hts and a minor |pg||
nt|bbramley: although with the Michaels bid they could be certain that one (or both) of their suits would split poorly|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes and got the michaels bid in the other room also |pg||
nt|henryb: looks like a straightforward game|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Agressive preempt:)|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: West is a bit heavy for a 3NT call here actually|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Since even KQxxx xx Qxx Axx makes a grand|pg||
mb|p|nt|bbramley: note that (in a vacuum) 6@D is superior to 6@S because with 3-2 @Ds it's cold without needing a @H trick|pg||
nt|lestergold: notautomatic to bid it but east has a very powerful hand|pg||
nt|raghavan: makes 6C|pg||
mb|p|nt|bbramley: declarer can ruff a club in the north hand, draw trumps and run spades for 12 tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: just a weather note from DC,  huge thunder and lightening storms AGAIN, |pg||
nt|sybarra: about the 6th day in a row |pg||
nt|bbramley: my flight home to dallas was supposed to go through DC, but they switched me to go through Chicago|pg||
nt|raghavan: 2c? by S|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/  for BBO-TV. Watch the play in all vugraph rooms at the same time, even while playing or in the lobby. No download needed. Some need Flash Player 10, ...|pg||
nt|Walddk5: most don't. Open one browser window per table|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: oh yes can be beaten thx spe bhy club lead dim switch and ruff|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2c by south vulnerable ?|pg||
nt|haans: mu not easy to find|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|lestergold: i dont think so!|pg||
pc|s2|nt|raghavan: Yes Mike we both think alike on this|pg||
nt|lestergold: especially after south jumps to 3s maybe??|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4s|pg||
nt|lestergold: i mean|pg||
pc|s6|nt|debrose: This sort of double of an artificial two-suited bid normally just shows "values", typically without a fit for partner|pg||
nt|sybarra: not a bad spot, and N will be delighted to see ak of @C |pg||
nt|pef: yeah, pretty shocking the kit and fred stopped in 4s--they must consider that a sure loss|pg||
nt|pef: plus, it denied us a chance to declare a new leader|pg||
nt|pbundy: i sometimes wonder how different the game would be if the players always knew current scores|pg||
nt|pef: this board looks like a pretty dull 4h|pg||
nt|pbundy: i agree; kit and fred probably do think they suffered a loss on that one|pg||
nt|lestergold: now they may well get there|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: This will be a pretty easy hand, 5@d 2@s 3@h|pg||
pc|dA|nt|raghavan: see the effect of X of S -|pg||
nt|pbundy: nice to come back and find out you've actually picked up 11|pg||
nt|pef: 3s a splinter raise in support of hearts|pg||
nt|pbundy: an agreement that is important to remember!|pg||
nt|pef: and that came right after they settled for 5dx on the previous board, so they'll be very surprised a net gain on the two|pg||
nt|migry: they have many ways to support spades after the opening - so there is no danger here|pg||
nt|pef: he's a passed hand and presumably would have used drury with a spade limit raise or the like|pg||
nt|joest: and all this bidding has nudged n-s precariously high|pg||
nt|daman: down in flames|pg||
nt|joest: they will start with three rounds of @ds I'm guessing|pg||
nt|daman: North had to think his partner had one @D at most|pg||
nt|joest: best might be to overtake and switch to the club ten on this layout but that is not obvious|pg||
pc|d9|nt|haans: 3@S-3NT-?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|pef: hmm|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|xenya: a tad heavy, yes, but it's a good practical bid i think|pg||
pc|d4|nt|pef: not quite so dull, but luckily for them 5h will succeed|pg||
nt|joest: from Weinstein's perspective Garner might have had QJx so what was the point?|pg||
nt|joest: pretty clear the club layout so I think Adam will pop king|pg||
nt|joest: but he still has a mess on his hands: potential spade misguess, surprising return diamond, another club through etc.|pg||
nt|joest: theyhave come to rest in2@s next door|pg||
pc|d3|nt|cherdano:  quick push here|pg||
nt|lestergold: now south can bid 4c|pg||
nt|raghavan: yes |pg||
nt|haans: but why opener may be short|pg||
nt|ralfwil: N can be weaker than 15P och this bidding sequence|pg||
nt|haans: on hcp|pg||
nt|raghavan: once 4C - no stopping 6|pg||
nt|ralfwil: so a little bit difficult for S|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d5|pg||
pc|d8|nt|pef: some specs are thinking 4s was blackwood for hearts|pg||
pc|dT|nt|lestergold: well still off|pg||
nt|pef: and 5h was an erroneous response|pg||
nt|pef: welland may have thought 4s was a mistake and he was correcting|pg||
nt|pef: well at any rate, I fully take back my "dull 4 hearts" comment|pg||
nt|pbundy: and i reiterate; always good to be on very firm ground when you play exotic treatments|pg||
nt|lestergold: well a lost opportunity|pg||
nt|haans: totally new bid|pg||
pc|dK|nt|cindy:  i dont see the need to bid at all with S hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh no!!!|pg||
nt|pef: willenken probably got it right and 4s was blackwood for hearts with welland showing 2 key cards|pg||
nt|pbundy: yes, that would be my guess, peter|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes Mike, but Ns bidding is not showing his nice values|pg||
nt|lestergold: i disagree with 4s stansby has already shown a self supporting spade suit in effect it was time to show his good 3 card club support|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|cindy:  especially when pd is passed hand|pg||
nt|raghavan: Now finding DQ is important|pg||
nt|lestergold: i agree with u Sindy its diabolical vulnerable|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry  Cindy |pg||
nt|raghavan: They might not have gone to game|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c3|nt|debrose: chambers was probably planning to support spades, but when partner bid NT that looked good to him|pg||
nt|jstokes: it's close to me; Stansby pulled in a bit with only an 8-card club fit; even with the extras N has, slam needs a little good  fortune|pg||
nt|lestergold: north also i agree has been very conservative but north was void in partner's suit that was why he held back|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|joest: i'm guess he'll return a trump|pg||
nt|panja: must play a @S now..on a @H..one trick now, and one on squeeze|pg||
nt|joest: if he returns a heart he gets squeezed but no way he does that|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: It certainly is, it just gives up on some slams, but they are unlikely enough for it to be correct I think|pg||
pc|d7|nt|joest: now the question is will Wildavsky give up all chance to make it|pg||
pc|s4|nt|raghavan: low spade now|pg||
pc|c5|nt|pbundy: now it is critical for e/w to hunker down and not let emotion get the better of them|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|lestergold: the double will find the dim Q and im sure this will be another 10 imp to welland|pg||
nt|pbundy: very easy to do so with 2 boards like the grand and this one|pg||
nt|pef: yeah, roy welland needs to take a deep breath--that's two very costly misbids in a row|pg||
nt|migry: i'm sure they'll handle it well |pg||
nt|dcbutler: probably a good time for a time out|pg||
nt|pef: looks like they may be taking one|pg||
nt|migry: they should|pg||
nt|pbundy: chris had a fine hand; controls critical|pg||
nt|pbundy: i agree, migry|pg||
nt|pef: that's actually a good tip.  nothing prevents you from taking a short break (well except time pressure) when a couple bad things happen in a row|pg||
nt|pef: personally I think splintering on the west hand is an overbid with his side holding qj and qj--partner needs a huge hand--even more than he had--for slam to be good|pg||
nt|migry: not sure what the bids meant in the last one - but i don't think welland should have splintered anyway with the soft values in @c and @d|pg||
nt|pef: we seem to think simultanously alike, migry|pg||
nt|migry: :)|pg||
nt|migry: u type faster tho|pg||
nt|pbundy: migry; i agree.  |pg||
nt|pbundy: stuff on the outside very soft...|pg||
nt|pef: you mean that I type faster, peggy?|pg||
nt|pbundy: you may type faster than migry|pg||
nt|pbundy: but not faster than i do, i would guess|pg||
nt|migry: basically the hand is worth 3 points |pg||
nt|migry: i admit to using 2 fingers only :(|pg||
nt|pef: is even bidding 4h on that hand automatic--at mps you might bid only 3 with such soft values|pg||
pc|h9|nt|debrose: By "values" I mean about 10+, maybe a good 9.   How would you think of that Shirley?  Bart?|pg||
pc|c9|nt|bbramley: in 6@D declarer can test trumps before ruffing a @C - if 4-1 then can draw trumps and hope to guess @Hs|pg||
nt|ralfwil: as the cards lie, 12 tricks in @s|pg||
nt|lestergold: brb|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|sybarra: should be values and I can punish one of his suits (usually the unknown suit) |pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h8|nt|raghavan: H e has to play low spade since if W has |pg||
nt|xenya: tough to bid slam intelligently after the pre-empt|pg||
pc|hA|pc|s5|pg||
nt|joest: so the maniacal east-west bidding will pay off|pg||
nt|joest: to the tune of 5 imps|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sK|pc|sT|nt|bbramley: yes, the dbl shows values - in the other room south showed @S support immediately, which is acceptable also|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Overtricks matter;)|pg||
pc|s9|pc|h5|nt|lestergold: kill point|pg||

nt|raghavan: another 10 IMP to Welland|pg||
nt|pbundy: really?  i am impressed with those two fingers!|pg||
nt|pbundy: i think with that shape 4@H is automatic|pg||
nt|pef: so out of nowhere the lead is now up to a significant 38 imps|pg||
nt|migry: the cat helps occasionally|pg||
nt|joest: wow|pg||
nt|joest: a potential slam here|pg||
nt|panja: just about a 50+% slam now|pg||
nt|joest: they have already pulled up in 4@h at the other table|pg||
nt|joest: not that this is a slam to write home about...it's just that it passes the acid test|pg||
nt|daman: acid or litmus?|pg||
mb|p|nt|pbundy: at least - ultimately getting there, one way or another|pg||
mb|1N|nt|bbramley: well, lucky or not, this match just got a lot closer|pg||
mb|p|nt|pbundy: lol, M|pg||
nt|migry: still a long way to go|pg||
nt|pef: I guess to be fair we should point out this is a real marathon event|pg||
nt|joest: both|pg||
nt|daman: West would not have raised to 2@S only|pg||
nt|haans: 3nt not an easy play|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 14-16 here|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: now a chan for more honey for welland if they find this excellent save|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: 4th from longest and strongest  or this will work also |pg||
nt|sybarra: I like this lead better|pg||
nt|pbundy: yes, many, many more boards in this match|pg||
nt|daman: ahhh|pg||
nt|joest: 2@c = art one round force|pg||
pc|h5|nt|lestergold: 5h costing 3000 against the infrangible 5c|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Easy game here:)|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Notrump ranges often affect swings alot... this one may be an unfortunate loss for NS|pg||
pc|h3|nt|pef: in fact, the robinson team has been playing nonstop since saturday--they came out of the round robin|pg||
nt|pbundy: and, needless to say, irrespective of which team fails in this match - still possible that the "loser" will be USA  2|pg||
nt|pef: as did the fleisher team in the other match|pg||
nt|pef: this may be unique that two of the semi-finalists (and the two in the lead) came from the rr|pg||
nt|dcbutler: i think the round robin actually started last Friday|pg||
nt|joest: is this the auction?|pg||
nt|daman: maybe 2@D is a constructive @H raise|pg||
nt|daman: you were right Jack|pg||
nt|joest: 2@d = 8+ HCP|pg||
pc|hK|nt|bbramley: and another swing coming - N/S have the first 8 tricks here for 200 and 7 more imps for meltzer|pg||
nt|debrose: We've seen a lot of the Schermer-Chambers NT defense system here.  It probably does not include a way to show clubs at the 2 level|pg||
nt|debrose: I think many would bid 3@C at favorable|pg||
nt|sybarra: we know his 2 @C shows majors |pg||
nt|raghavan: S will support clubs now - is it not cindy|pg||
nt|lestergold: gonna be hard for west to come in now|pg||
nt|jstokes: no one likes playing 2NT; he hopes for a good club fit and maybe his hand will take some tricks|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|joest: I think it is 1@h-1@s, 2@c-2@d|pg||
nt|joest: 2@s = 16+ HCP and three card spade support|pg||
nt|daman: Nickell now only down by 21|pg||
nt|henryb: so both matches heading towards a closer finish than we might have looked for earlier today|pg||
nt|henryb: Jacobs is still up by 26 with six boards to compare|pg||
nt|cherdano:  West must be thinking here obviously|pg||
nt|cherdano:  he would survie a slam try|pg||
nt|daman: he might just barge into it on his own|pg||
nt|daman: but when he sees only 2 key catds he might bail out|pg||
nt|raghavan: If H comes clubs can be developped|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Looks rather easy after a @h lead|pg||
nt|jstokes: good decision by martel, it seems|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Win with @hQ and play @cQ|pg||
nt|raghavan: S will play twice towards D QJ for entry after driving out C AK|pg||
nt|jstokes: of course, if Willenken had a second heart it wouldn't be so good|pg||
nt|haans: hearts 5-1 is great|pg||
nt|haans: 6-1|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|lestergold: but its favourable vulnerability abd he has nice 2 suiter|pg||
nt|joest: are you sure Howard did not start with 1@s?|pg||
nt|daman: yes|pg||
pc|c6|nt|lestergold: pity one of them bid by south!|pg||
nt|lestergold: ht lead double but then theyll go to 5c|pg||
nt|pbundy: i think that 6@S is makeable here without a club lead........  am i correct?|pg||
nt|daman: cards*|pg||
pc|cA|nt|bbramley: the modern style is to get in there, like pepsi did at the other table, but that jockeyed E/W into 3@D, which they made|pg||
nt|lestergold: not surely goona stand this|pg||
nt|pbundy: the hand that is short in spades is the hand that is shorter in diamonds|pg||
nt|pef: yes, you are right, started on friday, so seventh consecutive day of play|pg||
nt|panja: only an asking bid in Spades can tell W about @SAK|pg||
nt|henryb: I don't think so with only an eight card trump fit|pg||
nt|daman: he was hesitating for a reason|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|c2|nt|raghavan: Mike - are a prophecy teller|pg||
nt|lestergold: not difficult looking at north's hand|pg||
nt|daman: they are well on their way to slam with this auction|pg||
nt|joest: 2NT asks shape|pg||
pc|c8|nt|debrose: Perhaps he was hoping to defend NT successfully with the opponents vulnerable - something good to consider when overcalling over 1N in general|pg||
nt|migry: 6 can be made|pg||
nt|jstokes: 4@S alsoin the open room on Bd 8, where 6@C was makeable|pg||
nt|raghavan: Ralf declarer plays as u say - HQ why not H J|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Just to hide the @hJ|pg||
nt|raghavan: W thinks E may have another Heart But his counting is wrong |pg||
nt|ralfwil: But I think @cQ is better, just to win the trick|pg||
nt|ralfwil: both hands will duck and another @c mahes the defence helpless|pg||
nt|raghavan: Suppose E after CA, attacks Spade|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: Chris is thinking a long time on this play.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: with a long @h on W he probably is short in @c. That´s why|pg||
nt|xenya: 5 imps to Welland on 5 when NS in OR stopped in 2@S -- could have been 7 the other way if had S made 4@S here|pg||
pc|cT|nt|pbundy: and - a spec kindly informs me that zia made 6 on a heart lead - after bidding it|pg||
nt|henryb: partner could have cued with a very suitable hand. In fact he might have cued with the hand he has|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|panja: tough to bid the slam if A could be @DA|pg||
nt|joest: 3@h = 3-6|pg||
nt|xenya: on 22 sorry|pg||
mc|8|nt|raghavan: I mean the X|pg||
nt|lestergold: weak pard with weak suit he believes west's double|pg||
nt|joest: as Jackie Gleason used to say....|pg||

nt|raghavan: another push|pg||
nt|pef: lucky that you can draw one more round of trump and then pitch three clubs|pg||
nt|pbundy: no, i don't think so|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: will this be 3NT by NS|pg||
nt|haans: 6NT?|pg||
mb|1D|nt|debrose: five-card majors, six-card minors, I've even seen some six-card majors:) |pg||
nt|sybarra: this hand looks like it should make 2 @H |pg||
nt|ralfwil: the first slam 6nt..|pg||
mb|1H|nt|joest: a quick Stayman auction to 4@h|pg||
nt|lestergold: b|pg||
mb|p|nt|bbramley: 2 unstopped minors is a mild defect compared to some of the NT openers that we've seen|pg||
nt|xenya: 4@H makes here -- on a magic layout|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Yes if you can guess the clubs, which, after opening bid...|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Yes, but it's certainly not a game I'd want to be in|pg||
nt|xenya: now what do you bid as N?|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: I'd bid 2@d, but 4@H may be a better tactical bid|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Obviously, adam, cuz it makes:)|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: LOTT:)|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: The Law|pg||
mb|4C|an|Fit showing|nt|Vugraphu8: quick?|pg||

mb|p|nt|sybarra: on the @S guess I think |pg||
nt|vdoubleu: They are there.|pg||
mb|4H|nt|bbramley: if neil makes this the match will be tied!|pg||
nt|lestergold: should be bid but making is another matter thye cards are spitting here|pg||
nt|raghavan: 33 points + 10 controls  with NS slam in NT|pg||
nt|haans: close to 7 now|pg||
nt|haans: but an easy blackwood|pg||
nt|jstokes: i'd expect everyone will bid 6N on this one (but I've been wrong before)|pg||
mb|p|nt|migry: which is the right @h to lead?|pg||
nt|pef: yeah, I guess you are right|pg||
mb|p|nt|pbundy: on this auction, i might try the queen|pg||
nt|pef: none of them on this lie of the cards :)|pg||
nt|migry: :)|pg||
nt|pbundy: declarer more likely to have the king and hope partner can get in with another heart|pg||
nt|pbundy: 9 of clubs works super :)|pg||
nt|pef: yeah, and such an obvious lead on that auction :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: dims clubs makes even as long as they are in 6|pg||
nt|haans: we all have been wrong (and very) :))|pg||
mb|p|nt|bbramley: good guess on lead|pg||
nt|debrose: With a K-J guess and nothing else to go on it is often right to play the opening leader for the Ace|pg||
nt|bbramley: even with @S guess there's still a club problem|pg||
nt|debrose: Because he might have led the suit with the Queen, but would "never" from the Ace|pg||
nt|debrose: This is especially true when he is known to have an unattractive holding in the suit he actually did lead|pg||
nt|daman: tah dah|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Fit jump with only 4, that's kind of interesting :)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|lestergold: commenttaor's curse im a chronic suffere|pg||
nt|raghavan: Chip has to show his strength|pg||
nt|haans: were is the ace ask now?|pg||
nt|jstokes: I think, though, these boards are not being played in any other match. Is that right?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3nt?? |pg||
nt|jstokes: 3N seems fine to me -- he hasn't anything extra for his jump shift, and N could be quite weak|pg||
nt|raghavan: 1D and 3C has not fully shown south hand and N too has not|pg||
nt|jstokes: to me shouth has shown his values; without the great diamonds he wouldn't have a jump shift|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If N has shown a @h suit or stopper, so OK, but otherwise?|pg||
nt|haans: ace ask would get every thing right|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: but it got them there, that's what counts|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|debrose: I've been asked what happened to Zia, etc.|pg||
nt|pef: hard to see how this can make|pg||
nt|pbundy: it is|pg||
nt|pef: in fact all roads seem to lead to down 2 even with the relatively favorable heart lead|pg||
nt|xenya: now let us see if gets @Cs right -- not easy by any means|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|pg||
nt|joest: i'm guessing garner starts spades, before or after hooking a heaert|pg||
nt|joest: heart|pg||
pc|sK|nt|jstokes: who needs Blackwood :)|pg||
nt|raghavan: Oh great|pg||
nt|ralfwil: for me 3@h in 4-suit forcing|pg||
nt|lestergold: i need a few of these in my money games|pg||
nt|haans: well done Martel   BUT why? :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: we don't need no stinking Blackwood, sayd Chip.|pg||
nt|lestergold: but its the opps who always get them |pg||
nt|jstokes: everything is forcing after the jump shift, so no need to invent a bid.  But martel might have an awkward hand and not want to go past 3N|pg||
nt|haans: we do not bid 4th to force but to ask do you have a stopper here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: with @hKJ10x on N there could have beeb a guess, but now @hKQ|pg||
nt|ralfwil: been....|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s8|pc|s4|pg||
nt|debrose: I guess because those matches are two day matches, so they are playing the 4th of eight sets, the organizers decided it would be more excited to put the USA 2 bracket on tonight|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n on min values normal auction but one finesse the dim is working but another 4 finesses are all wrong|pg||
nt|migry: looks like declerer sd try his luck in the @c suit|pg||
nt|panja: y|pg||
pc|sA|nt|cindy:  W has his doubling shoes on    good dbl|pg||
nt|lestergold: a tiger double! i lioke it as a money player i approve|pg||
nt|lestergold: of course lead directional|pg||
pc|s6|nt|pbundy: yes, it seems like the straightforward way|pg||
nt|pef: the only alternative would be to play for both spades onside and then some sort of endplay|pg||
nt|joest: norths lead of a diamond from xxx suggests he has stuff outside he wants to protect|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s5|pg||
nt|lestergold: but he heard the limited auction so he knows there isno redouble on the way and he knows they are most unlikely to make|pg||
pc|sT|nt|lestergold: a heart up now for an overtyrick attemot|pg||
nt|haans: why not support @C then ask|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|pef: now east needs to return a low spade or the diamond to beat it 2|pg||
nt|pbundy: i'm afraid i must leave every one - the dentist calls :(|pg||
nt|pbundy: have fun - and see everyone later!|pg||
nt|pef: bye, peggy|pg||
nt|pbundy: thanks peter & migry and david :) :)|pg||
nt|dcbutler: thanks, Peg|pg||
nt|pef: would say have fun, also, but hard to believe that can be true at the dentist|pg||
nt|migry: bye :) we'll miss you|pg||
nt|pbundy: bye|pg||
nt|pef: willenken thinking "a heart, a heart, my kingdom for a heart"|pg||
nt|dcbutler: Nickell has the margin down to "only" 78|pg||
nt|migry: i think welland is thinking that more than willenken|pg||
pc|s2|nt|pef: at the other table, south opened only 1d (he does only have 19) and played in 3d down 1|pg||
nt|migry: good play - giving nothing away|pg||
nt|pef: so at this point welland probably going to gain 3 imps|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h2|pc|h3|nt|debrose: These players are playing the last set of an elimination match.  The loser is out of the event.  This is true of the other two vugraph matches as well|pg||

nt|sybarra: http://usbf.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=section&id=27&Itemid=224|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|debrose: The fact that the USA I bracket semi final matches are not especially close now could also be a factor, but given that they have another whole day of play anything could happen ...|pg||
nt|debrose: there|pg||
nt|lestergold: and that will be norh's only ray of sunshine that dim now its all horrid|pg||
nt|cindy:  n/s has like no tricks|pg||
nt|cindy:  on this def|pg||
nt|lestergold: no tricks unless then defencwe feeling generous|pg||
nt|cindy:  well 8 :)|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hJ|nt|lestergold: but these boys have a deficit to catch up so they wont be very generous today|pg||
nt|pef: if he had ducked the club to west at that point, he would have gone down only 1--it takes a bit of time to see why, but try it and wyou will|pg||
nt|raghavan: claim time|pg||
pc|hA|pc|d5|pg||
nt|bbramley: a third @D would have been fatal - this will reduce declarer to the same @S guess, which he'll probably get wrong for the reasons debbie cited|pg||
nt|sybarra: does the @H lead from E indicate give away the @S position |pg||
pc|h4|pc|d6|nt|debrose: Will he think Cohler might have balanced with the same hand with the spade Ace instead of Queen I wonder?|pg||
nt|xenya: will he play E for 18 hcp?|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|bbramley: i don't think so - with @SQ10 the trump shift would be equally attractive|pg||
nt|cindy:  getting crunch time|pg||
nt|lestergold: east will know to give nothing away|pg||
nt|lestergold: keep off them clubs all he needs to do|pg||
nt|joest: spade ruff, finis|pg||
pc|d7|nt|cindy:  well how about another heart   W must have club A for the dbl|pg||
pc|d8|nt|bbramley: yes, there are bidding inferences to consider as well|pg||
nt|lestergold: musnt play dim because he needs to leve pard with an exit card|pg||
pc|h5|pc|d9|pg||
pc|h7|nt|raghavan: Double dummy running C 10 helps|pg||
pc|dT|pc|h9|pc|d4|pg||
nt|debrose: Since he knows Cohler has only three spades, a spade lead wouldn't have been an option with this hand.  Either of the other suits more attractive|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh hes setting up hts in any case so doesnt matter|pg||
nt|raghavan: not now- first|pg||
nt|xenya: the moment of truth|pg||

nt|pef: now there a legitimate 2nt opener|pg||
nt|daman: 5 more to go|pg||
nt|henryb: but now S will probably declare @h -- maybe|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: 6n by north same |pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: tks|pg||
nt|joest: im guessing Doub will Q 3@h as a limit raise|pg||
nt|daman: yes|pg||
nt|haans: 3@C showing lead|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: It would ahve helped him if he cashed his last @h in hand|pg||
mb|3H|nt|sybarra: Willie?|pg||
nt|debrose: my general point was with nothing else to go on play opener leader for Ace - here he ended up with quite a bit else to go on|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: I asked and Neil claimed for down 1.|pg||
nt|sybarra: ugh,  tired puppies|pg||
nt|debrose: thx for clarifying that Willie.  I wonder what happened|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: In open bid 3NT only|pg||
nt|lestergold: or by south for that matter|pg||
nt|daman: whack|pg||
nt|joest: i'm not sure who has a double here|pg||
nt|joest: Doub if anybody|pg||
nt|panja: dbl 3@C and then go to @S if they bid @H...but now, penalty is difficult to figure out|pg||
nt|raghavan: Hands look like Tailor made - this for 4H|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: although they may land in 3nt with about the same result as the prior board|pg||
nt|henryb: and West does not have a lead problem|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: so may be swing if they reach 6C|pg||
nt|lestergold: well as we have seen before 505 slam its red or black on the roulette table with no 0 or double zero|pg||
nt|raghavan: Now easy to reach 6C what do u Cindy & Mike say|pg||
nt|lestergold: well they have a massive combination of cards apart form the lonely heart K!|pg||
nt|cherdano:  he does have a lead problem!|pg||
nt|henryb: well not in my opinion, and certainly not against four|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Brd 25, 5@d, undoubled in OR|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|debrose: If the play is as we saw this will get corrected eventually.  A misclaim can be costly, but can't force you to lose tricks you can't really lose|pg||
pc|s3|nt|Vugraphu8: I believe he lost 1 spade, 1 heart, 2diamonds and 1 club.|pg||
nt|debrose: With some partners I use this 2N response to show a "semi-positive" in clubs.  Perhaps that's how they play it here|pg||
nt|daman: oh no|pg||
nt|joest: well east-west had their necks out there on the chopping block, that's for sure|pg||
nt|daman: what is he hoping for with a 3@S bid from partner?   as it is, he will buy a trmenous dummy|pg||
pc|s2|nt|cherdano:  well i agree |pg||
nt|xenya: so a new leader|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|debrose: But I wouldn't bid 3@C over that with the South hand, and it's a pretty obscure treatment, so I'm guessing they were showing controls?|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: I don't believe I am allowed to say anything about it to the players.|pg||
nt|debrose: I don't know the rule, but I think you shouldn't say anything Willie.  It will get sorted out|pg||
nt|debrose: Lots of guesses about the system from specs:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: thxs for the information.|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 clubs for all we know was stayman|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: It will still be a big pickup for Welland though|pg||
pc|h4|nt|raghavan: overtake pl|pg||
pc|h2|nt|bbramley: my guess is 2NT=3 controls, 3@C=stayman|pg||
nt|raghavan: Adam pushing|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4s cant be support or spades here must be a cue cos clubs already agreeed|pg||
nt|lestergold: well theyv eha da fe poor results and know they cannot sit on thei laurels with the lead slippin away|pg||
nt|panja: too much activism perhaps, they escaped the penlaty, but not a losing lead|pg||
nt|joest: now that there's no diamond ruff anymore...|pg||
nt|joest: it's a losing lead if Wildavsky guesses what to do|pg||
nt|panja: well..@HA, @S to K, @H ruff and then @S finesse..I would think|pg||
nt|daman: that would be OK|pg||
nt|panja: but he must be thinking of 41 trumps|pg||
nt|daman: because of the non @D lead|pg||
nt|panja: y|pg||
nt|panja: and then the @H ruff might lead to a later force..|pg||
nt|panja: so..he has to weight that|pg||
nt|daman: nah   he'll just play @Ds|pg||
nt|joest: he might try to protect against 4-1 spades by heart to the ace, spade hook, heart ruff, spade hook|pg||
nt|joest: that seems very reasonable to me|pg||
nt|daman: he is ruffing the @H with short trumps in dummy|pg||
nt|panja: well..if @S are 41...he will get forced|pg||
nt|joest: fromhis perspective no diamond lead might mean no diamond stiff, hence a trump stiff|pg||
pc|hA|nt|vdoubleu: So it wld seem, another 5 IMPs to Welland|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4n sign off/|pg||
nt|pef: sorry, I guess with hearts 33 and a non club lead 3nt fetches, doesn't it|pg||
nt|dcbutler: yes - doesn't someone have a theory that it's better to lead from your 4 card suit than your 5 carder?|pg||
nt|pef: although it is possible that after aj of hearts holding, he may use the two diamond entries to lead toward the kq of clubs, taking 2h, 2c, 4d, and 1 spade|pg||
nt|migry: no:) there is a theory that it's better to lead from a 3 card suit than from a 4 vard suit|pg||
nt|pef: he'll have to judge on the play of the hearts whether they are splitting|pg||
pc|hK|nt|debrose: I just noticed Chambers doesn't have a standard 2@C opening.  Sorry, if I'd realized that I wouldn't have even tried to guess. |pg||
nt|daman: here he goes|pg||
nt|jstokes: as expected, 6N in other room on the last hand|pg||
nt|haans: @CK = do not play @D|pg||
nt|raghavan: To avoid ambiguity, S could have played C 10|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h8|nt|debrose: the responses|pg||
nt|debrose: Willie, just curious.  Are they writing explanations to things or doing the whisper thing?|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: They are writing and I cannot see it.|pg||
nt|sybarra: they write in little light pencil scratchings |pg||
nt|Walddk6: They should provide operators with binoculars I think|pg||
nt|debrose: Thanks. |pg||
nt|sybarra: some players hand opertor the sheets of paper,  many do not |pg||
nt|sybarra: *operator|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: Even if I receive the paper, i cannot read the writing in many cases.|pg||
nt|sybarra: been there done that |pg||
nt|debrose: So here we see yet another fourth best from longest and strongest opening lead.  And again it's the best lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: as I said,  little scratchings |pg||
nt|debrose: Got it willie, don't even bother trying with Michael's|pg||
nt|migry: they r in 2@h in the other room so if he makes it that will be a much needed pick up|pg||
nt|pef: just on the percentages the ace of clubs onside is more likely, but he may get some clues.  robinson/boyd will try to avoid giving them|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|lestergold: no blackwood|pg||
nt|pef: so at this level, this is quite an interesting contract to play|pg||
nt|migry: 2@h went down |pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: south has CJ pen card from last trick|pg||

nt|mtvesuvius: -3 in 5@d I think, Val :)|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Yes, top cashers|pg||
mb|1N|nt|lestergold: with that layout im not sure if 6c makes|pg||
nt|panja: good 6@C, about 50+%|pg||
nt|daman: chance for a slam|pg||
nt|raghavan: Old dictum - with eight ever and with nine never finesse|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: now that's an aggressive 3d preempt vul.|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Finally an easy hand for Larry.|pg||
mb|3C|an|Puppet Stayman|nt|debrose: It's normal to reach 3N here, which makes on a couple of finesses|pg||
nt|migry: X or 3@s?|pg||
nt|daman: a bit more breathing room|pg||
nt|haans: but one ruff what now??????????|pg||
nt|jstokes: as you can see, EW open (virtually) any 11 count|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|lestergold: anothyer 3n with spitting cards|pg||
nt|joest: so we'll see the Doub-Wildavsky inverted machinery|pg||
nt|daman: Cohen opened 1NT in the OR|pg||
nt|haans: and 1@C may be short so why a direct 1nt|pg||
nt|lestergold: will north stand it?|pg||
nt|lestergold: frigid of course|pg||
nt|jstokes: N certainly has his bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: pass is indicated|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|lestergold: if n/s stay out of it they may gain some imps|pg||
nt|dcbutler: same auction in the other room|pg||
nt|pef: I'm quite surprised boyd passed 3 vul. at imps|pg||
nt|panja: I dont think NS would like to try this....3N it would be|pg||
nt|lestergold: downside of opening hands on a pile of festering garbage|pg||
nt|lestergold: and west is lucky that partner's ten of clubs measn his qj clubs is working!|pg||
nt|haans: decl may be squeezed|pg||
nt|raghavan: "Welland CC says - open with 11, aggressive bids and may not have what is promised by bids"|pg||
nt|lestergold: admkittedly favourable vulnerability but ive seen a lot of bad results in this competition with people being over aggressive at these colours|pg||
nt|haans: 1nt may go down best lead|pg||
nt|jstokes: yes, one needs to give partner room -- this East hand was just too good for Willenken to avoid the X|pg||
nt|lestergold: i measn something qwrong when east has every inch of his business double and would have without the ten of clubs walking inot 1n+1 doubled!|pg||
nt|xenya: on 26, a natutal lead by Berkowitz let 3@H make|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: and so far they are not even in the auction|pg||
nt|raghavan: opp are bidding till now|pg||
nt|joest: on that last hand, one wonders about Weinstein's 4@h call with bad hearts and all his values in the opponents suits|pg||
nt|raghavan: not now 5 clubs + 2 Aes|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: would you guys pass on the south hand in these conditions?|pg||
nt|migry: south did the right thing to pass - he is "expected" to hold 7-8 points and this is what he has including the useless K@d |pg||
nt|pef: yes the k of diamonds may be worthless, but |pg||
nt|daman: missed opportunity|pg||
nt|jstokes: heart shift now will beat it (but not really a possibility)|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Pretty easy hand :)|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Around the ranch, Robinson 83-33 over Fleisher|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Nickell 38-25 over Jacobs|pg||
pc|d3|nt|raghavan: good|pg||
nt|cindy:  i would open the N hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: but here comes the n/scaval;ry charge|pg||
nt|henryb: bidding is risky: Weinstein's minors might be reversed. Perhaps Weinstein should only bid 3@s|pg||
pc|d7|nt|sybarra: operator tired also |pg||
nt|migry: i wd always pass with the south hand - probably double with North|pg||
nt|lestergold: how can it go off clubs established for 5 clubs and two acs|pg||
pc|d6|nt|sybarra: missing a pass ? |pg||
nt|lestergold: north hand has merits as an opener but not mandatory Cindy!|pg||
nt|cherdano:  or a self-splinter with 4@D?|pg||
nt|daman: 3 more after this and 18 IMPs to tie|pg||
nt|henryb: I think that could show a weird 2-suiter, say 6-6|pg||
nt|henryb: 3@s would set trumps and let partner cue with a suitable hand|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|debrose: 2@S here should just mean nothing else to bid.  Either no spade stopper, or in this case not eager to play NT from your side|pg||
nt|bbramley: the @S lead will scare declarer, but he doesn't have much choice about how to play|pg||
nt|cindy:  no :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: well a few imps back |pg||
nt|lestergold: e/w 's spirited auction has kept them out of a no play game|pg||
nt|cindy:  thats what happened at other table...N opened|pg||
nt|dcbutler: i agree - move the king to another suit, and bidding game seems auto red at imps|pg||
nt|daman: he got them to do what he wanted    his partner just didn't lead his singleton|pg||
nt|panja: nuisance call, hoping to escape and land a punch in the process...he almost succeeded|pg||
nt|joest: in fairness the range is so wide that when Doub only raised to 3 Weinstein wasn't sure whose hand it was|pg||
nt|joest: but 4@d on the way can't be crimed|pg||
nt|haans: and spade stopper|pg||
nt|jstokes: could have taken 1D, 3H, 2S and a club double dummy|pg||
nt|lestergold: what if north doesnt hold up gets on and establishes his 7 tricks|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If dummy had only @s10, 1nt had been unbeatable|pg||
nt|lestergold: is he still squeezed out of a trick/|pg||
nt|jstokes: kibs pointing out that declarer will have some pitching problems on the diamonds|pg||
nt|raghavan: yes probable|pg||
pc|s8|nt|debrose: Although North seems to think South showed something in spades.  What would he do with xxx, T9x, Kx, AKQxx?|pg||
nt|debrose: Maybe he figures they have noplace better to play opposite a hand like that, though 4@H seems possible|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes he does havwe problem didn see it at fist|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sK|nt|panja: correct @C play here would be @CA and then small to J?|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: pitch 1 h and 1 spade.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but this @s10....|pg||
nt|jstokes: then loses 3 spades, 3 diamonds, and a club|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|lestergold: well there is the reason why its not a mandatory opener|pg||
nt|joest: anyway this hand shouldn't take very long|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|nt|bbramley: i like to bid suits where i have something rather than suits where i don't - i might bid 3@C or 3@D|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|bbramley: anyway, north also has nothing better to bid|pg||
nt|debrose: North had no good bid, and I guess didn't want to distort his hand in some other way.  I don't think it's really playable to agree 2@S shows anything more than xxx in spades|pg||
nt|debrose: like Bart said:)|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|bbramley: when you're already in a game force it's normal to assume that responder has some natural descriptive bid available|pg||
nt|raghavan: South with 14 could have said 2NT|pg||
nt|haans: spadde first then hearts|pg||
pc|s6|nt|debrose: Maybe.  I specifically have the agreement with regular partners that 4th suit in 2/1 auctions is assumed not to be anything much in that suit |pg||
nt|debrose: Taking two finesses into the six-card spade suit is not a pleasant prospect for declarer, but as Bart said not much choice.|pg||
nt|debrose: There's a little something in the fact that Rosenberg didn't overcall - but could easily have one king|pg||
nt|debrose: I'm asked about the 2@H rebid, and it's noted that the rebid was 2@D in the other room.  There are lots of ways to treat opener's rebid in this auction - too complicated to get ...|pg||
nt|debrose: into now I think|pg||
nt|debrose: Though if Cohler, who certainly has no attractive discard, takes long enough perhaps we could write a book on the subject |pg||
nt|bbramley: more significant is that the tank strongly suggests that cohler has both red kings|pg||
nt|Vugraphu8: Cohler is thinking for a long time now. Schermer might draw some logical conclusions from this long wait.|pg||
pc|s7|nt|lestergold: sometimes partner does not have a fit with one of ur black suits and he adds up his points and insists onm game|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|bbramley: same start in other room|pg||
nt|haans: they get the cent now|pg||
nt|lestergold: will west be sure now that a psade is correct|pg||
nt|lestergold: Martel concealed his 6clubs|pg||
pc|sT|nt|joest: not with hearts wide open|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sA|pc|s5|pg||
nt|daman: finesse a @C and claim|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|lestergold: well done|pg||
pc|c5|pc|h4|nt|xenya: E under pressure now|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|debrose: Lots of comments/complaints from specs.  Cohler is generally a fast player and people should realize how different it is for the players from us looking at all the hands|pg||
nt|raghavan: got it|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c7|pc|cK|nt|bbramley: now, after the @HK pops up on the 2nd round, declarer can cash @DA before leading up|pg||

nt|panja: it must be right to pull?|pg||

pc|h8|nt|ralfwil: 9 tricks..|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|debrose: I don't think scoring mistake, if there was one, on 55 was made by operator.  he told us he heard neil say down one.  but fact remains if he made the tricks, that will be changed.|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx to Willie, our wonderful operator in White Plains |pg||
nt|debrose: sorry, folks, can't answer all the comments/questions.  appeciate the good wishes and advice thx|pg||

nt|lestergold: on spade switch|pg||
nt|migry: east denied 3 cards in spades |pg||
nt|migry: so 2@s now shows a doubleton|pg||
nt|pef: well that's an ugly contract|pg||
nt|migry: no idea why west had to bid at all with 6 points and no fit|pg||
pc|d4|nt|joest: in a just world one of the spade honors might be in the opening bidder's hand :)|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|pef: 8 points, but who's counting|pg||
nt|daman: Thanks to Arend Bayer and Henry Bethe for their insights|pg||
nt|xenya: tricky hand -- even on this fortunate lie|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sybarra: and thx to Debbie and Bart for joining the commentary and sharing your thoughts on these hands |pg||
nt|raghavan: upside qown signals|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Yes|pg||

pc|d5|nt|vdoubleu: Larry is busy trying to figure out red-suit honors|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: yes, and he knows Larry is ruffing this|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Does Larry know that?|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: :)|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: He might be placing declarer w/KQxxx of hearts + Diamond A|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: That's possible... it's much easier from up here :)|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: If that is what he has, then no need to ruff this.|pg||
pc|h4|nt|cherdano:  thank you everyone|pg||
nt|daman: thanks to USBF for permitting us to show these matches on BBO|pg||
pc|dK|nt|lestergold: or ten on ace of spade switch!!!|pg||
nt|joest: this was not the right moment for that play!|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: If.....but David gave diamond 2|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|lestergold: cashing out|pg||
pc|h5|nt|joest: 12 potential imps to close on if Weinstein can now make this|pg||
nt|panja: x ruf seems to be the best way forward|pg||
nt|panja: @D ruff, @H ruff, @D ruff, @CK, @C ruff, @D ruff with @SA..and a @H through @SKQx...|pg||
nt|joest: yes|pg||
nt|panja: with the crystal ball that we have of course|pg||

nt|sybarra: will let them compare |pg||
nt|debrose: I have confirmation Cohler won.|pg||
nt|sybarra: so congrats to Cohler |pg||
nt|debrose: On board 55 declarer did indeed misguess the spade by playing the King from dummy, not the Jack as the play record shows|pg||
nt|sybarra: hate to see anyone lose in this close a match |pg||
nt|sybarra: ok, now we know |pg||
nt|ahollan1: today was first day of usa1 semi-final --- no unplayed teams anymore|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s8|nt|panja: N had to force W with a @D..but I guess E had a reasonable line|pg||
