mb|d|nt|eleni: @h@h Kalimera se olous|pg||

mb|3C|nt|yuval10: you can see the next matches of today here:|pg||
nt|star6ija: 1h-1s|pg||
nt|andersk: 2/4 leads is wht we Norwegians call, svensk fordeling|pg||
nt|chick: a good example of why you should preempt (2N for minors) and then let partner make the rest of the decisions|pg||
mb|p|nt|collins64: good morning|pg||
nt|yuval10: http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_plugins/forum/forum_viewtopic.php?26046.0 post_26060|pg||
nt|bagman: Sementa likely to pass this as S could not open|pg||

nt|yuval10: we're due for some interesting matches|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|nt|yuval10: N in the OR also opened 1@h |pg||
pc|d8|nt|yannis3012: begining with a difficult 3nt to make|pg||
nt|star6ija: 17-18 direct 1 N, 19-20 via 1h|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|peachy: EW system is 4-card majors, light style 14-16 and 15-17NT. NS is Transfer Walsh 15-17NT|pg||
nt|athene: tricky hand to play - ruffing diamond finesse is a possibility|pg||
nt|bagman: There are lot's of high cards out and E passed and W opened weak|pg||
nt|athene: the problem is that ruffing diamond finesse might not be that useful, even if the king is with east|pg||
nt|athene: because if the @DQ is covered you have to use the @CA to get back there for a fast pitch of the heart|pg||
nt|athene: and that gives up on a double club finesse|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer wants a quick discards and wants to play the clubs for one loser|pg||
nt|athene: it's possible he might put all his eggs in one basket and take a normal diamond finesse; i.e. lead to the queen|pg||
nt|bagman: W  has shown up with @HKQ, does he have @DK and @CH?|pg||
nt|athene: the other issue is, you aren't necessarily going all-out to make|pg||
nt|athene: if it risks incurring two or three additional vulnerable undertricks|pg||
nt|bagman: S vulnerable he needs to make as many tricks as possible unless he has 9 safe|pg||
nt|bagman: He has likely 3 spade losers and a club|pg||
nt|athene: not at all an easy decision for south here|pg||
nt|athene: i prefer to open these hands 2@S first time|pg||
nt|athene: passing might appear safer but you often end up having to take more of a risk later at a higher level|pg||
nt|bagman: If he takes the straight diamond finesse, he needs to play @S to the Q|pg||
nt|athene: he knows the points are split fairly evenly between east and west|pg||
nt|bagman: Hoping for Jx KQxxx Kxx Qx or similar leaving E AKx xx xxx Kxx|pg||
nt|athene: west has weak-2 and east can't open - that doesn't leave much room for variation, with 21 hcp missing|pg||
nt|athene: the only problem is, there are a lot of variations in which cards each defender has|pg||
nt|bagman: If he places KQ of hearts and @DK west, he is quite restricted to place the rest for a make|pg||
nt|andreasw:  only lead is @S if u dont want to give any trick's|pg||
nt|haans: South do not liked it|pg||
nt|othered1: hi!|pg||
pc|d3|nt|lmeili: 4N shows 6 4?|pg||
nt|ziff:  Looks like the par contract|pg||
nt|yuval10: so no swing in a rather dangerous board |pg||
nt|yuval10: Israeli open for instance opened 1@c and played it wrong-sidedly, going down 1|pg||
nt|aldek: it can be made, but unlikely|pg||
nt|cameron_1: yes|pg||
pc|d5|nt|roswolf: another thinnish game reached|pg||
nt|haans: landed fair|pg||
nt|poohbear: trump lead and its over|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: yes not easy|pg||
nt|haans: Hi Barry wlc|pg||
nt|poohbear: sorry|pg||
nt|poohbear: dont mean to chat|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: hi barry|pg||
nt|udo: 4 @H fails , even finding @H Queen doubleton is not enough|pg||
nt|udo: no entries for the 2 top-spades for diamond discards|pg||
nt|brolucius: East expects six hearts for a 2@H rebid that bypasses so many alternative rebid. Hence the raise.|pg||
nt|udo: hm, only 2 clublooses|pg||
nt|udo: losers|pg||
nt|othered1: with @CJ on, this does make (6@H, 2@S, 1@D, 1@C)|pg||
nt|udo: small @H to jack will be enough|pg||
nt|othered1: or win in dummy, pitch @C, hook rounded suits|pg||
nt|othered1: sorry, pitch @D|pg||
nt|udo: or 2 discards after heart to the jack|pg||
nt|othered1: (Ignore me, I'll awaken shortly)|pg||
nt|udo: jack of clubs is the important card, and it is well placed|pg||
nt|udo: same here:)|pg||
nt|udo: good morning ED:)|pg||
nt|tomi2:  I think they should not have bid that game, IMO east should have passed 2@H|pg||
nt|brolucius: At last I have managed to find a Lauria-Versace convention card. The 2NT response on Board 1 was a limit bid in partner's major. More often nowadays, 2NT shows a game-forcing ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: raise.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|andreasw:  u can also selved @d self but would problebly go wrong|pg||
nt|aap00: now decl have to guess @c - sur ehe will|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: good lead by East |pg||
nt|haans: a killer|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|haans: i do not like prempts over prempts|pg||
nt|h_karluk: they missed 6@d by N|pg||
nt|lesh: the dbl is asking for the type of hand and 3@c is min hand with 6+clubs|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hA|nt|andersk: a push now, 1 NT RD would been interesting|pg||
nt|andreasw:  solved|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|jameslee 2: on the other room hand 1 the lead was a small @S in 4@H |pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: kalimera se olous|pg||
nt|star6ija: J@h was better continuation|pg||
mc|8|nt|ady: should get home here     club loser will disappear|pg||
nt|davidb: S should play cl  to defeat|pg||
nt|ady: might beat it now with a club switch|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer seeks an entry with the @HJ.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We have something for the history books after this mornings round. Italy has lost back-to-back matches! No-one can remember when that last happened. Los 10-20 to Hungary last night ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and 14-16 against Hungary today|pg||
nt|tomi2:  was his intention to duck the 10 or overtake?|pg||
nt|othered1: EW system is described as Swiss-ACOL.   I'm not sure how limited the 2@H bid was.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Duck, I expect, to set up the @HJ (or avoid losing a trump trick). Unlikely that they would duck @HQ - but possible at this level.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We got the names right now, thank you operator|pg||

nt|mcarroll: They certainly play fast!!|pg||

nt|shevek: both pairs play 2/1 GF ; cc at: http://tinyurl.com/29ud57z|pg||
mb|1S|nt|star6ija: something like 5@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: a heart pip shourt of a good slam here   can make by dropping A@H doubleton|pg||
nt|bagman: 5@C on the heart finesse|pg||

nt|haans: all you need for slam is no clubs lead :)|pg||

mb|2S|mb|2N|nt|eweber: unluckily we still don't have running scores from group B in the Open|pg||
nt|motu: DBL is 6-8|pg||
nt|boyklas: 1@h is a transfer to @ss|pg||
nt|lmeili: easy 3N for EW|pg||
nt|boyklas: nvul, would you have bid 3@s now?|pg||
nt|motu: not my style|pg||
nt|ady: if in a slam 6@C is the best spot    6@H down quickly on a club lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: true but slam is a little far fetched if you ask me|pg||
nt|davidb: N practically looks at 8HCP|pg||
nt|bagman: 3NT on the same|pg||
nt|star6ija: and to guess heart position of course|pg||
nt|aldek: operator, what has happened?|pg||
nt|Walddk12: Welcome to Murat Molva|pg||
nt|MolvaM: hello everyone|pg||
nt|andreasw:  again 3nt is better then 4@s|pg||
nt|shevek: 3@s = 6 cards, Max|pg||
nt|andreasw:  Hello Murat|pg||
nt|shevek: hi Murat|pg||
mb|4S|nt|mcarroll: So no problem then :)|pg||
nt|udo: everybodys choice?|pg||
nt|brolucius: The play on the last deal is one that you often see in book (sacrificing a trump trick to gain an entry to two winners). Less often at the table.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lmeili: not me|pg||
nt|roswolf: hearts will be the chosen trump suit i'm sure|pg||
nt|MolvaM: hi :)|pg||
nt|andreasw:   Haraldsson got scared?|pg||
nt|shevek: well stopped|pg||
nt|MolvaM: if 3@s shows max, then north must go 4@s no?|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: pre vs pre + un vs un are useful toys|pg||
nt|ady: should not be if in a slam|pg||
nt|roswolf: maybe not -|pg||
nt|bagman: Now S must do something|pg||
nt|athene: it might be hard for NS to diagnose they hold a diamond stopper betwen them|pg||
nt|brolucius: In that example he probably had a trump loser anyway.|pg||
mb|p|nt|eweber: and the result of round 2 is not yet online|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 1@D has multiple meanings, could be negative|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 1NT is a strong NT |pg||
nt|eweber: 18-20|pg||
nt|Gerben42: maybe 17 because white / red they play a mini NT|pg||
nt|roswolf: we will see now|pg||
nt|santyclz: 4@s e-w looks interesting.|pg||
nt|bagman: Looks like NS end in a club partial|pg||
nt|athene: many pairs would be able to bid with south's hand first time|pg||
nt|shevek: sry, I see now it shows 6@s and minimum|pg||
nt|aap00: 1@c = precision?|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: not a good position of the key cards seems will go a few down |pg||
nt|haans: needed the 7th hearts for 3@H bid|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|star6ija: Bulgarians are in 3N in the open room|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Vladimir and Ivan vs Thor Erik and Thomas|pg||
pc|c3|nt|bagman: good for them as the heart finesse is off|pg||
nt|athene: for example playing transfers you could bid 1@S there to show values but deny a major|pg||
nt|athene: assuming your 1@C is not raise-able, as is the case for most people these days :(|pg||
nt|bagman: I wonder what 1NT would have shown by S |pg||
nt|star6ija: board 1|pg||
nt|mcarroll: A swing so as 3NT makes on 1|pg||
nt|shevek: with Max he'd bid 3 in a new suit|pg||
nt|MolvaM: makes sense then|pg||
nt|Walddk12: We'll have the name corrected soon. I asked our coordinator to go to the room|pg||
nt|Walddk12: Some operators don't look at their screen|pg||
nt|andreasw:  let's say Magnusson had show,n max would u bid 4@s or 3nt?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 4@s for me|pg||
nt|shevek:  Haraldsson : http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=3371|pg||
nt|MolvaM: running scores at....|pg||
nt|andreasw:  u dont really have ace's and king's and the minor suit's is not wery good in 4@s i think i would bid 3nt and let p decide|pg||
nt|MolvaM: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/runningscores/asp/roundteamsconditstatclassicmod.asp?qtournid=819&qshowflag=1|pg||
pc|c2|nt|lmeili: if N bids 3@s after X, declerar might guess wrong of @d|pg||
nt|boyklas: double by west was take-out or establishes GF?|pg||
nt|motu: t/o|pg||
nt|lmeili: except guessing @d all other ways work|pg||
nt|haans: or costly ...|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|lmeili: @d AK then @h|pg||
nt|bagman: The diamond length often makes up for the missing stopper|pg||
nt|athene: south really likes his hand after his partner's free 2@C rebid|pg||
nt|bagman: Interesting 3@H|pg||
nt|bagman: cannot be natural|pg||
nt|athene: he is looking for 3nt - prepared to play 4@C if necessary|pg||
nt|haans: cue-bidding makes slam harder to make :)|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: the bid is on the limit ·3@H |pg||
nt|haans: but all will get higher|pg||
nt|andersk: this will be an easy make |pg||
nt|lesh: Probably he is going to play @d to the ace and a spade|pg||
pc|s2|nt|roswolf: north does bid the slam how is south's luck today?|pg||
nt|ady: may get this right     west will show with singleton club|pg||
nt|davidb: W  overcall will make the guess in H tuff|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup agree david|pg||
nt|roswolf: i expect this to go down|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: seems  a 4@H -1 |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: with some chance for declarer he will take a good thinking |pg||
pc|s3|nt|Walddk12: Name corrected|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sK|pg||
nt|bagman: 5@C is a good bet|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Where are we going now? is 4@S Keycard?|pg||
nt|haans: nope cue no dim con|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Thanks|pg||
nt|mamos: this looks like a hand for topping up the caffeine|pg||
nt|shevek: Iceland lost their 1st match vs Italy (14-16) and then went on winning the next 10|pg||
nt|ftpe: bidding seems like strong club|pg||
nt|lesh: not the best line though|pg||
nt|andersk: opps|pg||
nt|lesh: he is going down now|pg||
nt|chick: that's what I would have done, Jivko, not sure why he would not|pg||
nt|andersk: @H now and underleading @H back|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cT|nt|Gerben42: Netherlands had a bad start vs Ireland, whereas Russia started with a small win vs Sweden, a competitor for a Bermuda Bowl spot|pg||
nt|shevek: Wales is running 6th|pg||
nt|MolvaM: seems many norths could just blast 4@s after hearing pd open a weak 2 here|pg||
pc|s5|nt|haans: 5@H risky|pg||
nt|xenya: @SA followed by @SK and another spade would have defeated it -- previous hand |pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|lmeili: when @d QJ does'nt fall, still the chance @h 3-3 or Tx, and @c K on side|pg||
nt|bagman: It needs the heart finesse|pg||
nt|aap00: 1@c = strong, 1@s = looks like "bal GF", some relays|pg||
nt|ftpe: yes|pg||
nt|haans: few entries to dummy|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: getting worse after K@H|pg||
nt|haans: well only non vul|pg||
nt|brolucius: Only 1 IMP to Germany for the fancy play in 4@H. Semanta advanced with 2NT on the East cards, after the same start, and 3NT was bid and made.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: guys, was that a hidden camera joke? I meant 2nd trick a low spade towards dummy|pg||
nt|andersk: Or @C|pg||
nt|lesh: if the king of spades is 3rd in East, he needs A@h to be in West|pg||
nt|lesh: the small spade makes no sense|pg||
nt|h_karluk: I think today is Monday June 28, 2010, so obviously not April one, whatever|pg||
pc|d9|nt|aap00: playing @dQ, not 10 correct - you can discard 3d @d by @c|pg||
nt|aap00: decl has to guess @s and "find" 1 more trick: it can come either from @d or @h |pg||
pc|dA|nt|shevek: maybe they shouldn't be so keen not vul|pg||
nt|ftpe: declarer knows who has king he know|pg||
pc|d3|nt|motu: what about restriced choise|pg||
nt|mcarroll: S looking for N's entry for a @D ruff|pg||
nt|haans: many austrians have played Blue Clubs for 30 years|pg||
nt|MolvaM: specs tell me 3@s shows a no-singleton hand and a bad-bad hand|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: true|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|santyclz: Certainly rates to be a much quicker hand in @cs than @ss.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Now has the problem of guessing the trumps to make 5|pg||
nt|aap00: thk no real chance to go wrong|pg||
nt|ftpe: he will win for sure, but migth take some time :)|pg||
nt|xenya: no -- he will play for @SKxx in the W hand|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d7|nt|yuval10: good def. so far|pg||
nt|yuval10: let's see what line declarer will take....|pg||
nt|davidb: has to play 3 D now - might help (Q D )  the guess|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|d5|pg||
pc|s7|nt|collins64: it looks like it'll be +1 for Belgium here|pg||
nt|star6ija: to make or not to make|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sQ|nt|haans: we have all learned yes on 8 no on 9|pg||
nt|star6ija: that is the question|pg||
nt|lesh: what it seems to be a flat board turn out to be a possible swing|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: Greece lost a trick here|pg||
nt|collins64: not anymore |pg||
pc|d6|pc|dJ|nt|rigas_karo: still|pg||
nt|yannis3012: yes. greek women are losing 10-0 after three boards from russia , one of the favourites|pg||
nt|andersk: -2 for a push|pg||
nt|ady: going down|pg||
nt|shevek: yes, a bid of 3@c/@d or@h over 2NT would show a Max with a shortage|pg||
nt|MolvaM: I see several 4s making with this board in other matches|pg||
nt|andreasw:  i have seen worse 2@s opening before|pg||
nt|brolucius: It may seem a bit light to bid 2NT on a 10-count, but both responders were allowing for six trick-producing hearts ion the opener's hand.|pg||
pc|s9|nt|haans: not beg difference|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|Gerben42: Netherlands is |pg||
nt|Gerben42: hosting the next Bowl so pre-qualified, but must improve to be in the medal race|pg||
nt|eweber: well, the tournament is not really over yet :)|pg||
nt|Walddk12: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/Events/ebl/2010ostend/default.asp  for convention cards and other useful information|pg||
nt|yuval10: making now|pg||
nt|yuval10: for a double-partial swing|pg||
nt|haans: big|pg||
nt|star6ija: ehhh.|pg||
nt|star6ija: nice guess|pg||
nt|star6ija: saved some IMPs|pg||
nt|aap00: J was last chance|pg||
pc|cA|nt|h_karluk: The Bamberger pair was good at their own sys, got many victories|pg||
nt|xenya: but it's odds in to play for the actual spade disitribution|pg||
nt|xenya: odds on *|pg||
nt|aap00: no squeeze chances, so N has to guess - play on @dJ onside or @hK remaining bare|pg||
nt|ftpe: and both works :)|pg||
nt|aap00: y |pg||
nt|tomi2:  2004 yes, 2008 not|pg||
pc|h5|nt|rnmalik: yep|pg||
pc|c6|nt|andersk: actually quite interesting start|pg||
nt|ziff:  @CJ is a bitextreme if he wants to look like someone with a singleton @D|pg||
nt|lmeili: so J@c from JTxx?|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|andersk: Croatia NS aggressive style|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: hand 2 3@D contract also & same lead 4@D |pg||
nt|haans: Fallenius do no like it|pg||
pc|c7|nt|eweber: the open series is being played in two groups for a whole week|pg||
pc|h4|nt|motu: well done|pg||
nt|aap00: certainly, after @sJ odds were on playing for KJx|pg||
pc|s8|pc|c4|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: nice defense K@D well done |pg||
pc|h2|pc|hJ|pc|hK|nt|Gerben42: this was a good stop by NS - with so many HCP, 4NT might be too high|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ziff:  Whatever he wanted to do, he didn t fool Michael|pg||
pc|h6|nt|eweber: the best teams will qualify for the 9 rounds of final in the last 4 days|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 4NT from N is okay though...|pg||
pc|h9|mc|9|nt|lesh: Ace of spades and a spade could be a line as well|pg||

mb|p|nt|othered1: Action in the other room may get some of that back|pg||
nt|barnets: bulgaria have good pos here|pg||
mb|1C|nt|mcphee: they sure do|pg||
mb|1D|nt|jillan:  they had avery active bidding at th eother table and ended up in 4@S doubled, which made with an overtrick|pg||
nt|jillan:  strong @C|pg||
mb|1H|mb|d|nt|othered1: west seem to have treated his hand as worthy of a Drury-type bid and east may have anticipated shorter support, even with the jump to 4|pg||
nt|othered1: or more h igh card values|pg||
nt|jillan:  according to the system 1@H from S shows 4+@S|pg||
mb|3H|nt|othered1: And here the transfer has let EW find their @H fit at the lowest possible level|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: assuming double did show @H|pg||
nt|mcphee: we have a nice aggressive table:)|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|barnets: in other room east opened 1@H south played 4@SX west led the @CA and switched to a heart|pg||
nt|othered1: south thinks that with north's strong bidding they likely can run @C.  North corrects|pg||
pc|dK|nt|barnets: so e/w lost a @D trick|pg||
nt|jillan:  the @C opening is natural, more or less, promises at least 2 @C|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dJ|pc|d9|pg||
nt|othered1: so 9 imps to Bulgaria|pg||
nt|barnets: @DJ reverse attitude or rev count|pg||
nt|barnets: heart seems next|pg||
nt|barnets: though east cant see norths clubs|pg||
nt|barnets: he knows the @DQ will be set up for discard|pg||

nt|h_karluk: quite easy 5@d there|pg||

nt|jameslee 2: a good 4@H contract coming along |pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2:  hi all|pg||
mb|2C|nt|motu: hi tomi|pg||
nt|ziff:  Hi Tomi|pg||
nt|chick: yes, jivko, but @DA and small trump still doesn't hurt in that case|pg||
nt|lesh: if the small @s wins, then you have a problem|pg||
nt|andersk: over 3rd and 4th hand openings EW play a drury|pg||
mb|d|nt|motu: 2@D is 15-19 with any onesuiter or 20-21 NT|pg||
nt|lmeili: wrong side to play @s|pg||
nt|motu: 2@S is 9+ any hand|pg||
nt|andersk: Sorry Im late, was dinner here:)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: however there's transportation problem|pg||
mb|p|nt|eweber: I assume the final will be played with 10 teams given the number of 9 rounds|pg||
nt|h_karluk: its ok, welcome back|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi Anders|pg||
nt|yuval10: can they reach 5@c here?|pg||
nt|roswolf: in the other room|pg||
nt|ady: kib has asked for the link for the running score|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 10/11 tricks in @H |pg||
nt|lesh: if you were ducked by 3rd K@s in East you have are in trouble. You have to decide what to do.|pg||
mb|2S|nt|haans: 1@D normal trf|pg||
mb|4H|nt|Gerben42: no its played with 18 teams, you dont replay the teams in your group|pg||
nt|star6ija: some prospects for making|pg||
nt|cameron_1: David has a much harder time in his 5@d |pg||
nt|aap00: say u have 6 for KJx vs 4 for J10x, but believe that 50% times W will play K with KJx => 3 vs 4 remaining|pg||
nt|haans: normal today|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 1@D meaning  4 card @H|pg||
nt|lesh: but still a trump finess seems to be the best line|pg||
mb|4S|nt|lmeili: if @c lead & guss wrong of @s|pg||
nt|yuval10: S has good values with A@c and K@h but can she ask about N's distribution|pg||
nt|paulg:  http://tinyurl.com/ebc-open-b   http://tinyurl.com/ebc-open-a   http://tinyurl.com/3yl8spu  for running EC scores|pg||

mb|d|nt|andersk: Will be interesting to see if they find the deefence|pg||
nt|andersk: Hi Martin, Hamdi:)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i wonder west's defense to this one|pg||
nt|andreasw:  1nt force?|pg||
mb|p|nt|andersk: I beleve 2 @C is drury with 3 card|pg||
nt|aap00: no cards for 6 |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 2@S shape & points |pg||
mb|p|nt|eweber: and of those 10 teams 6+NL will play in the Bermuda Bowl|pg||
nt|andersk: Has to switch @D or @C noe, I predeict @D|pg||
nt|ady: this needed a major suit lead |pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: quiet lookin partial, declarer probably making 9 tricks|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 3@H  6 card |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 4@H end |pg||
nt|lesh: unfortunately for E/W 4@s is making|pg||
pc|cA|nt|yuval10: did well here, and in the OR as well|pg||
nt|MolvaM: running scores http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/runningscores/asp/roundteamsconditstatclassicmod.asp?qtournid=819&qshowflag=1|pg||
nt|MolvaM: norths 2@c could be the gazilli convention that several pairs play these days|pg||
nt|MolvaM: showing either a natural @c rebid or some sort of strong hand|pg||
nt|ftpe: hearts 5-2, so only 5 spades here|pg||
nt|aap00: so 4 is reasonable contract|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer has some sort of chance to ditch a diamond on one of the black suits. A diamond finesse and a heart break would then give him a chance.|pg||
nt|brolucius: South's signal on the top-club lead deterred Lauria from cashing his other high club, thereby giving declarer a diamond discard. Buit the @DK is wrong anyway.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Vladimir was in Warsaw Poland in 2006 and in Antalya 2007 with reasonable ranking, however this time surprised to his line|pg||
nt|h_karluk: *Antalya Turkiye|pg||
pc|c4|nt|h_karluk: he is supposed to count and protect himself endplayed|pg||
nt|roswolf: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/runningscores/asp/roundteamsconditstatclassicmod.asp?qtournid=820&qshowflag=1|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, 11 tricks|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|eweber: o.k., sorry|pg||
nt|davidb: good stop as 3NT -only 8 tricks|pg||
nt|santyclz: 6 imps to France on board 2 for going + in both rooms.  |pg||
nt|othered1: it's difficult to stay out of this game, unless west opens strong NT and east chooses not to act, vulnerable.|pg||
nt|lesh: should take much longer before claiming|pg||
nt|andersk: Kinda stragne 2 @C and 4@H bid from Charlie here, I would prefeer 4@H over 1 @H opening, isnt that what the hand is wurth?|pg||
nt|lesh: certainly 4@H would do the job. I dont think North would dbl|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|andersk: agree|pg||
nt|ftpe: he now|pg||
nt|aap00: in brd 2 W(!) pushed to 3nt... |pg||
pc|h7|nt|h_karluk: declarer for sure would try long string|pg||
nt|haans: the more @D he plays the better defense|pg||
nt|h_karluk: we will see |pg||
pc|hK|nt|andersk: 990 now|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|chick: bypassing drury may have some kind of subtle implication about strength|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Gerben42: changed from last time and will change again next time I guess|pg||
nt|andreasw:  3nt 11 trick's finessing @d|pg||
nt|othered1: i.e, it's a game virtually everyone will get to|pg||
pc|s4|nt|athene: lauria's negative double over 2@D warned south off getting involved with his spade suit|pg||
pc|sA|nt|aap00: for me strange, with 10hcp and passed pd |pg||
nt|haans: not easy clubs finesse|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|lmeili: if S ducks @dA|pg||
nt|bagman: I would guess that declarer discards a club on the hearts and gives 2 spades and 2 hearts|pg||
nt|athene: Sementa is prepared to lose his @HK to hold declarer to one heart winner rather than two|pg||
nt|bagman: Sementa's duck gives defense 3 spades instead of 2 spades|pg||
nt|brolucius: A high spot-card (@C7) is discouraging, against both suit and NT contracts. (Reverse attitude).|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mcarroll: I agree - lets the defence signal very comfortably|pg||
nt|h_karluk: the only possibility to make this a thrown-in play with misdefense of West|pg||
nt|aap00: so, "well deserved" -5 impls|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|haans: @H6 even|pg||
pc|s5|nt|peachy: NS 1H opening might not be everybody's choice, but they play 4-card majors, light style|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|peachy: oops, he overcalled!|pg||
nt|ziff:  I must confess that I would not sell the E hand as 9+, but Entscho s judgement has always been somewhat different....|pg||
nt|h_karluk: pitch the spade and lose the board|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|MolvaM: this is a 630 or 660 hand for the field to rest their grey cells|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Thor Erik was in San Remo 2009, i guess evil made him do that double|pg||
pc|d2|nt|andersk: will probably go down|pg||
pc|s8|nt|athene: he will carry on with the time-honoured antidote to a 4-4 trump fit - keep leading trumps|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer can play N to have AQx and make now 10 tricks|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|peachy: ignore everything I said, please :)|pg||
nt|bagman: Or W can let N to have @SQ|pg||
nt|athene: declarer probably thinks the club is offside|pg||
nt|athene: he will try and endplay north|pg||
nt|athene: duck another spade now, perhaps|pg||
nt|bagman: The @C-finesse working is an extra bonus|pg||
nt|andersk: maybe, I cant see what damage ¤@H direct might couse|pg||
pc|c6|nt|xenya: i'm told there are no commentators in the open room, so I think i'll switch over there|pg||
nt|ftpe: now he plays safe|pg||
nt|aap00: oh, yes me too |pg||
pc|c3|nt|haans: they do not show count|pg||
nt|andersk: Time to give @c count for East now|pg||

nt|barnets: north in other room is not having  agood game he took out his partners X of 5@D to 5@S|pg||
nt|barnets: a quite horrible decision|pg||
nt|jillan:  yes they played 5@S doubled when EW bid 5@D, and went 2 down|pg||
nt|othered1: 1N = 5 other minor, 4 in a major|pg||
nt|othered1: 5+ other minor, that is|pg||
nt|mcphee: do not most play pass and pull as a stronger action in that position as well?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|mb|d|mb|2H|nt|othered1: 2@C presumably looking for the major?|pg||
nt|othered1: Perhaps 5+ in either, not other minor, as a spec suggests, though their card seems ambiguous.|pg||
mb|2S|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d8|pc|dK|pc|d4|nt|barnets: better judgement all round here|pg||
nt|barnets: at this table|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|jillan:  not at all so much firework from NS as in teh other room|pg||
nt|othered1: this may be tough to hold to 3, needing a duck of @SA and @H shift|pg||
nt|mcphee: playing on @S will set up 2 @H discards|pg||
nt|othered1: OK, the official description, "if opening 4+ cards then other minor; if less then Any ( we played team trials vs their team)"|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s2|pc|s8|pc|sK|pg||
nt|mcphee: nice move to not rise A@S|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|othered1: or maybe declarer can keep north off lead to setup @H for @C pitch|pg||
nt|mcphee: that seems to be his next best option|pg||
nt|jillan:  needs to duck 2@H to do that|pg||
nt|othered1: two high @H, but up ace on low.|pg||
nt|jillan:  or rather the Kand Q I mean :)|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|pc|h6|pg||
nt|jillan:  he must know that S has the @C A so it seems like the right play |pg||
pc|hK|nt|othered1: If south has KQJx, then declarer must take and lead low towards 10 later.|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h7|pc|h3|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mcphee: some concern of a possible @H ruff I guess|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hJ|pc|h9|pg||

nt|brolucius: We will see if Italy can avoid bidding game on the values for Board 4.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: passed hand, both vul, inappropriate|pg||
nt|chick: I'm not a drury fan at all myself :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|andersk: finally some that plays it, I have for 18-20 years|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: a contract in @D by N-S wil se where they get too |pg||
nt|haans: many kibs say why not finesse in clubs And right but only an overtrick|pg||
nt|h_karluk: it's not a vicious toy, esp revd|pg||
mb|2C|nt|eweber: with no bulletin online so far informations spread slowly|pg||
mb|2D|nt|roswolf: this could be a thin slam|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: a 7/2/2/2 Nt by East interesting |pg||
nt|haans: Finals words: willwats: could ruff out the q if 2nd,3rd or 4th,  finesse only neccassary if 5-1 or 6-0|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: block 2@D  by S so no transfer by West|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: North looks like a 3@D bid|pg||
nt|udo: nice 4 @H for EW|pg||
nt|lesh: N/S might appear to be in 4@s|pg||
nt|h_karluk: it helps you to know 3 or 4 cards support and to test whether sound or light opening there|pg||
mb|2S|nt|peachy: fast pace at this table|pg||
nt|cameron_1: X?|pg||
nt|shevek: coffee hand, brb :)|pg||
mb|3D|nt|eweber: 2@c precision style again|pg||
nt|lmeili: looks like 12 tricks in NT|pg||
nt|cameron_1: seems trange|pg||
nt|mamos: prsumably majors|pg||
nt|mamos: and or values   "competitive"|pg||
nt|cameron_1: i was referign to David's initial choice of 2@c rather than X|pg||
nt|mamos: from an english poerspective these Queens all look to be in the wrong places  opponents hands rather than theirs|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: no he stayed still Vul danger|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but use it moderate , 10 goodish or minimum 11 required|pg||
mb|4S|mb|5D|nt|haans: lavinthal|pg||
nt|yuval10: 4@h here is actually easier, but 4@s will prevail, too|pg||
nt|yuval10: in 4@h you can discard 2@s's over the KQ@c|pg||
nt|tomi2:  do you play 1@S as 5 cards here?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: iceland lies at the top of the table with 2 more days to go|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 1 more match today and 6 matches the next days|pg||
nt|MolvaM: top 9 ranked teams will qualify for the second stage|pg||
nt|MolvaM: then teams will play a round robin with the teams coming from the other group|pg||
nt|ftpe: south is looking for 6 spades, but cant win here|pg||
nt|haans: 3@C full of danger|pg||
nt|haans: 2@D may have been trf|pg||
nt|haans: more logical|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: not in this position |pg||
nt|haans: but bidding @D twice is?|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: but one never knows in this game |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: what a parnership can bild up |pg||
nt|psridhar: Hi all|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: big think there by N |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: hi |pg||
nt|haans: only 40 hcp exist|pg||
nt|psridhar: two high class pairs facing each other -should be an absorbing contest|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 5@D can be made true will see where he ends up|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: but for the @S finesse had a good chance to make it.|pg||
nt|roswolf: never likely to be bid though|pg||
nt|brolucius: You see how light South's 2@S response is. Everyone does that nowadays, to allow partner to compete if he has extra trump-length. In the Bad Old Days, a raise to 2@S was considered ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: a 'free bid' (particularly in the USA) and promised a king's ransom.|pg||
nt|udo: and 4 @S NS  |pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: if thats not a minimum hand I never saw one|pg||
nt|davidb: normal  450 . will be flat all over I believe|pg||
nt|haans: yes both both clear for second rr|pg||
nt|brolucius: Italy has reached game on 4, I am told.|pg||
mb|d|nt|mcarroll: Lebensohl|pg||
nt|andersk: must be the best weak 2 ever|pg||
nt|yuval10: 4+|pg||
nt|tomi2:  Hackett raised to 3@S with only 3 cad support. I play a cuebid by overcaller as 3 card support raise with maximum here, so 3@S would always be 4 cards for me|pg||
nt|yuval10: seem like a nice agreement|pg||
nt|yuval10: you have to play over the @h's in 4@s|pg||
nt|yuval10: Alfredo Versace is going down in 4@s in his match|pg||
nt|udo: 4@H is ok played from W|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: yepsry|pg||
nt|yuval10: means that this contract isn't so easy |pg||
nt|mamos: this all looks odd|pg||
nt|MolvaM: while the results from their own group will be carried over|pg||
nt|xenya: well if N just had @HA instead of the King... |pg||
nt|lesh: 2@c prec, 2@s non forcing.However South has a decent hand he tried 4@s|pg||
nt|lesh: it also put pressure on the oppoinents and they might as here bid 5@d|pg||
mb|5S|nt|eweber: 2NT was nat, nf|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I would open 1 @S with that hand|pg||
nt|ady: apart from spades behaving  would need to guess diamond rightr   a poor slam|pg||
nt|Walddk1: http://tinyurl.com/ebc-open-b   http://tinyurl.com/ebc-open-a   http://tinyurl.com/3yl8spu  for running Euro scores |pg||
nt|andersk: might settle for -1 here, If @S lead, @H lead -2|pg||
mb|d|nt|peachy: with trumps not splitting, this will be tough to play, unless of course EW bids again (I doubt it)|pg||
nt|wygbe1: 6d is pretty  good, but the cards are not friendly|pg||
nt|lmeili: 3@c says 9+ red cards not min hand|pg||
nt|lmeili: tx Rado, 3@s may show sington @c|pg||
nt|tomi2:  what would you lead here?|pg||
nt|lmeili: probably @d, not @s not @h not @c|pg||
nt|tomi2:   seems to cause communication problems, but I cant Imagine to lead a @D from jxx|pg||
nt|motu: i guess i would lead a@H|pg||
nt|tomi2:  seems like a good idea too, in case S has also a singleton you cut this communication|pg||
nt|ziff:  I hope for a @D (obviously), but would lead a @H myself|pg||
nt|motu: with 3@C showing 9 red cards a @D lead looks unatraktiv for me|pg||
nt|haans: Blue Clubs with 5-c M|pg||
nt|cameron_1: I guess Tom chickened out and assumed David was under pressure picking a short major, even so|pg||
nt|ftpe: rigth|pg||
nt|ftpe: 3 spade is probably min and 3-carder in sp|pg||
nt|haans: holy ...|pg||
nt|udo: 4@S NS is beatable NS, but only with the unlikely @D lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|star6ija: running scores in this group on http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/runningscores/asp/roundteamsconditstatclassicmod.asp?qtournid=819&qshowflag=1|pg||
nt|xenya: not much to the play here, declarer losing a heart and a club|pg||
nt|ftpe: y|pg||
nt|udo: and @H switch|pg||
nt|udo: otherwise 1 @H goes on the ace of clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|lmeili: he hears |pg||
nt|cameron_1: I think the problem started with Daid's initial choice of 2@c|pg||
nt|cameron_1: rather than X|pg||
nt|aldek: or pass|pg||
nt|cameron_1: the ebu didnt pay it table money to watch him pass|pg||
nt|mamos: hmm   |pg||
nt|aldek: they never pay|pg||
nt|MolvaM: current ranking|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: I dont think even 5 makes|pg||
nt|peachy: but 5 Is certainly reasonable bid, |pg||
nt|andreasw:  and endplay is up|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: there we go 5@D X all |pg||
nt|h_karluk: 5@d likely doubled off three, unless @cK works in some way|pg||
pc|dA|nt|brolucius: South can visualize a club ruff after the E/W club bidding.|pg||
nt|andersk: even better to get 200|pg||
nt|chick: turning a small plus into a big minus :(|pg||
pc|d8|nt|haans: good opening VUL|pg||
nt|andersk: I open 2 @S, but my openings are 9-13|pg||
nt|MolvaM: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/runningscores/asp/roundteamsconditstatclassicmod.asp?qtournid=819&qshowflag=1|pg||
nt|psridhar: If north had raised diamonds at his first turn -3d over 2S- he would have avoided bidding at 4 level on his own , like he did here|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: the card play to position of the AQ@H guess|pg||
nt|tomi2:  Lauria cold pitch the @HQ|pg||
nt|tomi2:  @SQ|pg||
nt|andersk: 500|pg||
nt|andersk: sorry|pg||
nt|lesh: well 5@s isnt the best call|pg||
pc|dK|nt|Gerben42: Rudakov removed because of the @S problem, not because of his good suit|pg||
nt|wygbe1: play off 3 top clubs pitching h's and let e ruff|pg||
nt|peachy: declarer is likely to adopt that line, but then he has to deal with the H, S and club losers in hand|pg||
nt|peachy: might turn out too tuff|pg||
nt|wygbe1: yes, the line that works is to just ruff the 2 low clubs in dummy and draw trumps, finessing against d jack|pg||
nt|wygbe1: even that could run into difficulty|pg||
nt|h_karluk: oh yes, now i liked more Lawrence's Law of total tricks |pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|andersk: If not I open 1|pg||
pc|h9|nt|haans: dim 2-2 big plus|pg||
nt|haans: @HQ double right|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: he guess correctly seems like @D 2/2 helps sure does|pg||
nt|haans: 2nd opinion: ronsheffy: makes!!!|pg||
nt|tomi2:  so versace now could signal a spade in his ruff|pg||
pc|hK|nt|brolucius: An even discard (@D10) is discouraging in that suit.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|andersk: yes|pg||
nt|peachy: In any case, they avoided the hopeless slam in this room.|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|Gerben42: the 4-1 break means that 2@S NS wont make either|pg||
nt|wygbe1: the slam is actually not bad with reasonable splits, but here the splits are not good|pg||
nt|chick: the Law of Total Tricks doesn't work very well above the 4 level|pg||
nt|lesh: 2 bad boards for Bulgaria so far|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Lawrence advocated 5 level belongs to opponents|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ftpe: declarer playing safe using club ace, afraid off ruffs|pg||
pc|d3|nt|brolucius: @S7 reverse count. (High = odd).|pg||
nt|udo: -1 can be a good save,,lets see hwats happens in the other room|pg||
pc|d2|nt|MolvaM: since scores are carried over it is necessary to do well against the other teams in yr group to have a good chance of winning the vent|pg||
nt|MolvaM: event|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|sK|nt|udo: 4@S will make most of the time, i would say|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|yuval10: now duck @s perhaps|pg||
nt|psridhar: cant finesse dia for fear of h ver ruff|pg||
nt|tomi2:  north now did not know who has the @SJ and versace played his lowest club for the ruff to avoid playing back a small spade, because he wasnt unsure too|pg||
pc|s2|nt|andreasw:  still wrong claim in  board 4?|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|Gerben42: running scores group A: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/runningscores/asp/roundteamsconditstatclassicmod.asp?qtournid=819&qshowflag=1|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Trump now is the winner, but difficult to find|pg||
nt|lesh: 2down and the plus scored turned into a minus|pg||
pc|s7|nt|star6ija: @s also|pg||
nt|star6ija: Marashev can find @h switch easier|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Absolutely|pg||
pc|d7|nt|haans: endplay in @D|pg||
nt|haans: easier i N would have played @DJ|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 750 for Israel |pg||
pc|sA|nt|Gerben42: group B is broken|pg||
nt|wygbe1: for example, with 22 d and 43 clubs, the slam spreads - |pg||
nt|wygbe1: even with 31 d and 43 clubs has play|pg||
nt|peachy: right. And if it does make, vul slam is expensive to miss|pg||
nt|andersk: Most 1 @S opening does not have 6 tricks, almost incredible that he opened weak 2|pg||
nt|yuval10: will be very hard if @s's are 4-1|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|MolvaM: well 630 is a possible score too|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|nt|tomi2:  gogoman should ruff the heart now with the queen and wait por partners spade tricks later|pg||
nt|yuval10: has N ruff with the 9@s now the contract would've gone down|pg||
nt|tomi2:  we have good and bad news from German open team. Good news is, that declarer managed to get 10 tricks in spades in this board. Bad is, that they bid slam...|pg||
pc|cA|nt|peachy: This is the second hand in this match where stopping lower gains for NS,  they did it inBd 2|pg||
pc|c5|pg||

mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jillan:  well done so far, now all he has to do is make it :)|pg||
nt|othered1: Anyone else think west's 4@S bid was a bit precipitous in the CR, or did east's 2@C bid tend to deny that pattern?|pg||
pc|c6|nt|mcphee: i think 4@S in the other room was a lazy way to reach a game|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|pc|c2|pg||
nt|barnets: but east did have a sing spade -- bidding 1n-- probably unexpected|pg||
nt|othered1: I'd have more sympathy with the 4 S bid had east rebid 1N, natural (if allowed in their system)|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dA|pc|dK|nt|jillan:  he DID rebid 1NT|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|barnets: what was 1N?|pg||

nt|othered1: Right.  Sorry about that.|pg||

pc|d2|nt|barnets: so west knew he my be opp a 1-4-4-4 hand|pg||

nt|mcphee: i prefer the NT rebid to 2@C in fact|pg||
nt|barnets: alll going well here|pg||
nt|othered1: In many precision-based styles, the 1@D opening, 2@C rebid has a lot of ground to cover, so they're eliminate this hand by requiring a 1N rebid.  Not this pair,  however.|pg||

nt|athene: 7@H here - let's see if they find it|pg||
nt|andreasw:  he had 11 trick's|pg||
nt|udo: otherwise,,5@C is cold for EW|pg||
nt|udo: not cold,,but on @H s coming in|pg||
mb|1C|nt|boyklas: it seems that we have some connection problems|pg||
nt|h_karluk: board 6 and 23-0, wonder a recovery possible|pg||
nt|yuval10: not an easy game at all, it was|pg||
nt|yuval10: and now for a goulash hand|pg||
nt|tomi2:  I think 1@C is 2+@C for the German pair|pg||
nt|bagman: In the late 80's  passing out a deal was nearly impossible|pg||
nt|athene: EW might be able to create some confusion|pg||
nt|athene: with 11 -card spade fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|collins64: Mike is going to open 2@c with a weak major 2-suiter|pg||
nt|h_karluk: echo|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Gerben42: weak 2 in @D|pg||
nt|Gerben42: refreshingly natural|pg||
nt|eweber: there is a tiny little chance of an endplay vs South|pg||
nt|wygbe1: guess i missed something, down 1 looked pretty easy|pg||
nt|yuval10: really hard to predict what the final outcome here will be|pg||
nt|tomi2:  am no fan of double and no fan of redouble here. what contract does Della Monta want to play doubled, iff ops bid it?|pg||
nt|yuval10: X from S is dangerous in the sense that sometimes P will pass and you have very few defensive tricks for him|pg||
nt|tomi2:  yes|pg||
nt|roswolf: another straightforward board|pg||
nt|bagman: p-p|pg||
nt|athene: 2@S must be a takeout |pg||
nt|bagman: S is confident in his methods|pg||
nt|athene: takeout of spades|pg||
nt|fokal: 2@d shows @s , strong or weak|pg||
nt|fokal: hi all by the way|pg||
nt|athene: maybe 2@S is specifically michaels|pg||
nt|bagman: Is it T/O or 2-suiter?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi.|pg||
nt|athene: many pairs play "leaping michaels" over these bids, so 4@D would be reds|pg||
nt|bagman: hi|pg||
nt|fokal: so I guess 2@s shows a two suiters for sure|pg||
nt|athene: maybe NS don't play that or maybe south prefers to treat his hand as a 3-suiter|pg||
nt|bagman: N has an easy raise of the q-bid :)|pg||
nt|bagman: if methods permit such treatment|pg||
nt|hawe45:  So - I was late from another match|pg||
nt|athene: north pretty much just wants to RKCB in hearts|pg||
nt|athene: but he might have to set hearts first|pg||
nt|MolvaM: double now?|pg||
nt|andreasw:  1@s and 4@h after 3nt|pg||
nt|udo: 7@D|pg||
nt|udo: or NT|pg||
nt|udo: lets see|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is natural to bid 4@H rather than 5@C because it is a trick less. When the opponents go to 4@S and you want to bid at the five-level, you have a free choice between hearts and ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: clubs.|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: i agree with those 2 arguments you made|pg||
nt|shevek: neither side can make game|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 3nt seems not makable|pg||
nt|tomi2:  lauria only needs to find partner with two aces here, should be possible to find|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ziff:  In a marked contrast to our table Scotland and Italy have won 40 and 46 IMP in 5 boards.....|pg||
nt|lmeili: they should reach to 4@h, 1@c-1@d , 1N 2@c|pg||
nt|tomi2:  sometimes pd will jump to 2 level with 4 cards only and you have a hard bidding later|pg||
nt|tomi2:  os della Monatas hand now worth a raise to 6?|pg||
nt|yuval10: i believe W must add now....P is willing to play in the 5 level ALONE when he's VUL, and you have AK A?|pg||
nt|tomi2:  AKtx of trumps and the ace in their suit?|pg||
nt|yuval10: *she's|pg||
nt|yuval10: very likely that we'll see a sacrifice from NS|pg||
nt|tomi2:  if S bids 5@D now w has a difficult bid|pg||
nt|yuval10: Pass forcing?|pg||
nt|tomi2:  E-W are clearly in a forcing pass situation, but do you pass with TWO small dias?|pg||
nt|roswolf: unless n/s get carried away|pg||
nt|davidb: yes  no  great  boards yet...|pg||
nt|ady: can make 6NT    6@S  beaten on heart lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: the axe might descend here|pg||
nt|davidb: ??  aces...|pg||
nt|bagman: Ok, now let's see how the void is shown|pg||
nt|cameron_1: might chooce 4@s since Drijver's X was prob snapfragon style i.e. 2@s 5@c|pg||
nt|aldek: double showing clubs and a doubleton spade|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: it's never easy to bid a grand slam which depends on a void (i.e. where you are off an ace)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: still a possible 5 imps missed|pg||
mb|4S|nt|eweber: but NS can escape by cashing their tricks|pg||
nt|lmeili: 2@h 3@h|pg||
nt|haans: close to spade raise|pg||
nt|yuval10: you have to do something with this AKTX trump and A@h|pg||
nt|cameron_1: choose a game i guess, a little strange because most use that to claim "ownership" and show a good hand|pg||
nt|mamos: what strength was 2@h   do we know - forcing ?|pg||
nt|mamos: will england bid on ?|pg||
nt|andreasw:  3nt should not win yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: he ruffed H with the Q, unnecessary|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like another boring hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: empting to Dbl with S hand|pg||
nt|peachy: tempting|pg||
nt|andersk: If 5@C makes, then 3 NT makes too|pg||
nt|bagman: If N can ask aces, S can bid quite a lot|pg||
nt|athene: did south think 4nt was asking for the minor?|pg||
nt|fokal: sementa has no idea of the @s void , he might try to protect his K of @s|pg||
nt|fokal: by bidding NT|pg||
nt|bagman: Now 5@S, I guess|pg||
nt|fokal: obvisously S interpreted 4NT as 'what is your minor , partner ? '|pg||
nt|athene: they might scramble into the grand if south finds 5@S now|pg||
nt|hawe45:  What was 2 @S exactly?|pg||
nt|bagman: It's bad to have your misunderstanding on a grand slam deal|pg||
nt|athene: but if there really has been a misunderstanding it's asking a lot to recover and go on to bid a tricky seven|pg||
nt|athene: 2@D showed spades, weak or strong (or some monster balanced)|pg||
nt|athene: so 2@S was obviously a cue - whatever they play that as|pg||
nt|hawe45:  So 5 @S now might do...|pg||
nt|cameron_1: i imagine tom was happy not to have to guess over an immediate 4@s from Brink|pg||
nt|MolvaM: thomas bids what he hopes he can make|pg||
nt|MolvaM: reasonable bid but doesnt work today|pg||
nt|MolvaM: but maybe pushes opps to 4@h|pg||
nt|xenya: 2N promises 20+|pg||
nt|Walddk2: His suit might not be solid :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|rigas_karo: 4@s in 5-1 fit in the oper room, probably +1|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: looks like an easy 3NT|pg||
nt|boyklas: its difficult to find the Jxx after this bidding, except if he lead it|pg||
nt|ady: should south double if they get to 6@S    might remove to 6NT|pg||
nt|psridhar: difficult to bid 5d on their own last bd- needed push from oppo|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: a part score 2@S by West|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so W missed to find 4/4 hearts fit|pg||
pc|d8|nt|wygbe1: yep it is|pg||
nt|Walddk12: Good morning to Paul Hackett|pg||
nt|wygbe1: and it was |pg||
nt|ady: problem is not there|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w were merciful but have missed the boat somewhat|pg||
nt|cameron_1: it is usally right to bid on know double fit hands|pg||
nt|tomi2:  but he should not bid 4nt too fast, because it could be keycard for spades, and partner would sell @SAK and no @CA as two aces|pg||
nt|andersk: 4@S is makeable, but <i do not understand why Charlie didnt look for @H suit first|pg||
nt|andersk: need to do something good in @s to make|pg||
pc|d5|nt|tomi2:  not hackett should bid 5@H rather than double I think|pg||
nt|ady: sorry    blind spot    2 aces missing|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: can go -1 with a good defence timming|pg||
pc|dA|nt|rigas_karo: well this is an easy way :)|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Morning everyone|pg||
nt|peachy: Good morning Paul|pg||
nt|wygbe1: morning|pg||
nt|yuval10: very interesting sequence to work with your partner|pg||
nt|bagman: When a misunderstaning occurs, it's difficult to recover, because neither player knows what the misunderstanding has been|pg||
nt|athene: even if both players suspect, neither one can be sure his partner is in on the secret|pg||
nt|bagman: If N thinks that S has 1 ace and @S-void, he still cannot bid the grand|pg||
nt|athene: these sort of auctions are where top pairs really have to put in the time away from the table|pg||
nt|athene: because there are lots of imps riding on these hands|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|boyklas: thats true|pg||
nt|athene: even if they don't come up all that often|pg||
nt|Walddk2: OK|pg||
pc|d3|nt|Gerben42: this contract will be no problem, will duck once to guard against 5-2 @C|pg||
nt|ziff:  2@Sx would have been 3 down at least on a @D lead or switch, but not easy to find, and 620 are available|pg||
nt|star6ija: 11 tricks|pg||
pc|d2|nt|paulhac:  It is a playable game just but not with the trump break they did well to only go 1 off in the othere room|pg||
nt|lmeili: after 1@c 1@d what is 1N shows? some player holds 7 HCP as E they may not inv to game|pg||
nt|andersk: this will be -2 or more|pg||
nt|MolvaM: what about 5@c?|pg||
nt|udo: @D agreed now ?|pg||
pc|d4|nt|brolucius: 5@H, cue-bid denying a club control. Now 6@C will show first-round club control.|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|wygbe1: playing for 50 hearts, could set up spades and run them through south for down 1, losintg ak of spades and 2 hearts|pg||
nt|h_karluk: -3|pg||
nt|h_karluk: just play off top hearts|pg||
nt|andersk: I know - 3 double dummy, but they dont see all cards:)|pg||
nt|rodvenn: In practice 3@h is a good bid|pg||
nt|h_karluk: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_total_tricks|pg||
pc|s8|nt|Gerben42: sry always 2nd stopper|pg||
nt|eweber: just heard the second match of the Dutch was 11-19 vs Spain|pg||
nt|aldek: 4@S was close as well|pg||
nt|tomi2:  with 5@H he committses himself to 6 level even if partners @C were QJT, or does 4@S also show @C control?|pg||
nt|udo: hard now|pg||
pc|s4|nt|motu: depends on vul|pg||
nt|h_karluk: true|pg||
nt|yuval10: now only 2 down....can't be good for the leaders|pg||
nt|xenya: 12 tricks |pg||
nt|ftpe: yes|pg||
nt|ftpe: south should play club|pg||
nt|brolucius: Versace may think: 'I must have club ace to suggest a grand slam (with another spade cue-bid), so this is more accurate, showing @SK too.|pg||
nt|lesh: have to guess right|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ziff:  undo?|pg||
nt|motu: vul 1nt is 18-19 non vul 20-21|pg||
nt|udo: as?  josephine ?|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|andersk: @H 9 for @D switch|pg||
nt|haans: Q and J for @D switch|pg||
nt|h_karluk: no|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @hQ for @s switch|pg||
nt|andersk: Do you good people understand the 5@C raise?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: if we are talking abt std signals|pg||
nt|andersk: I would probably try 3 NT|pg||
nt|h_karluk: by N?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: yes lots of game plus - but slam minus  hands|pg||
pc|d9|nt|eweber: results of round 2 are online by now |pg||
nt|eweber: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/10Ostend/asp/roundteams.asp?qtournid=820&qroundno=2|pg||
nt|eweber: England leading the group with 50(!)|pg||
nt|eweber: Russia 13th with 27|pg||
nt|eweber: NL 17th of 19 with 17|pg||
nt|othered1: But first south recues @S, guaranteeing some kind of @C control, I'd think|pg||
nt|udo: 5@S is ?|pg||
nt|brolucius: He would just bid 6@D with second-round club control.|pg||
nt|tomi2:  5@S = both black aces|pg||
nt|udo: i am told @S king and first round club|pg||
nt|brolucius: Well, he has already shown @SA, hasn't he? (With 4@S).|pg||
nt|tomi2:  probably with no @SK he'd bid 6@C|pg||
nt|brolucius: Indeed.|pg||
nt|udo: and 6@D with second round @C controll?|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mamos: England have done well on this board I feel|pg||
nt|othered1: And Lauria selects the highest scoring (and unbreakable, if partner has 1@D) spot.|pg||
pc|d6|nt|haans: Bulgaria do not play Blue Clubs but Precision|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: dangerous but works here |pg||
nt|psridhar: true 3h makes -but two eight card fits deterred the pairs from venturing into 3 level -THE LAW :)|pg||
nt|tomi2:  problem is again, waht does he bid with no club control? 5nt is nonforcing?|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|boyklas: 4C at te open room? not 4S?|pg||
nt|lmeili: tx, that means they'll reach 4@h any how|pg||
nt|andersk: Need AQxxxxx and almost nothing more for it to be makeable|pg||
nt|roswolf: israel avoided the slam on bd 3 in the other room and so gained 11|pg||
nt|star6ija: yes|pg||
nt|star6ija: no trump is 14-16...and some new gadgets over 1@c openning|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mcarroll: In a word - No - I do not understand it|pg||
nt|andersk: 3 NT is my choise|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hard to reach there|pg||
nt|andersk: hard to reach 3 NT?|pg||
nt|andersk: Just pull it out of your bidding box:)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: can you make a sample bidding?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: LOL|pg||
nt|h_karluk: it should be played by N|pg||
nt|aldek: could not do better|pg||
pc|c7|nt|mamos: surely not|pg||
nt|mamos: not @hK|pg||
nt|xenya: but declarer can either get @Ds righ or squeeze N in the reds |pg||
nt|rodvenn: that is not the law as I understand it|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c5|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 9 tricks.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: welcome again.|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c9|nt|rigas_karo: West bid 4@s over 2@h|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: but maybe he bid 4@c to indicate @c +@s and east (reasonably) passed with singleton @s|pg||
nt|collins64: no Filippos opened 2@h with his 6-card J|pg||
nt|andersk: I understan that 3 @S is a tempting bid|pg||
nt|star6ija: this sequence showed 4-4-4-1 singleton not defined, 2N was relay and 3@c showed @d singleton - 4@h denies control outside|pg||
nt|aldek: the operator is in trouble, it seems|pg||
nt|mamos: vugraph op???????   you there?|pg||
nt|xenya: for the same result|pg||
pc|s2|nt|collins64: and West bid 4@c with his 55 passed by East|pg||
nt|boyklas: ok, 10 imps for greece|pg||
nt|cameron_1: seems right result|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|rodvenn: two 8-card fits make you compete to the 3-level according to the law|pg||
pc|sA|nt|andersk: understand|pg||
pc|s5|nt|peachy: good line to keep it down 1q|pg||
nt|haans: will lose 2 clubs|pg||
pc|h5|nt|peachy: 1|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|wygbe1: looks like that is the line adopted|pg||
nt|peachy: without the Dbl, it is not as obvious|pg||
nt|andersk: I type too fast:)|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: to take opps out of the 8 card fit |pg||
nt|haans: 8 carder outside of the law|pg||
nt|h_karluk: thanks to Marty and Larry, sorry for wrong remembered that devised by Mike|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s7|nt|lesh: wrong guess which leads to -1|pg||
pc|h7|pc|sK|pg||
mc|9|nt|jameslee 2: chance for West|pg||
nt|rodvenn: 8 carder is at the core of the law. This is where it starts|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: guessing @C is home |pg||
nt|psridhar: the law says there are as many tricks as there are trumps|pg||
nt|haans: hard to belie he get this chance|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: a good think & decision wil he put the Q@C or not ?|pg||
pg||

nt|jillan:  so a 12 dfor Bulgara who evens out the score|pg||
mb|1S|nt|jillan:  the other table played in 2@S doubled 2 down for 500 to EW|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|r|nt|jillan:  but would you prefer to be in 4@H?|pg||
nt|othered1: Things look favorable for 4@H EW, even on forcing @S defense|pg||

mb|2S|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|mcphee: nope 4@H it is|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jillan:  so we get to see an interesting plat - we hope :)|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|jillan:  play|pg||
pc|s2|nt|othered1: GIB might make an overtrick.  Flesh and blood declarer, who doesn't peek like GIB does, has other considerations -- 10 tricks.|pg||
pc|s7|pc|h4|pg||
nt|jillan:  he needs to set up D |pg||
nt|barnets: well dec plays @CAK and another|pg||

nt|bagman: He needs to guess 3 things: a) 5@D shows the 2nd suit, b) S has 2 aces, c) S has @S-void|pg||
nt|athene: well there's no way anyone is guessing all that|pg||
nt|athene: what they need is some way for north to agree hearts|pg||
nt|athene: then it's relatively easy|pg||
nt|athene: but slam auctions are hard when no-one knows what trumps are|pg||
nt|bagman: I'm sure they'll go back to the drawing board after this match|pg||
nt|santyclz: Perhaps 3@s over 2?  |pg||
nt|athene: it's sort of like trying to build the top story of a house of cards and then fill in the first layers later|pg||
nt|psridhar: of course it is genral precription -law can go wrong at times|pg||
mb|1S|nt|lesh: a peaceful 4@h here, but lets see|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i guess slam @h|pg||
mb|d|nt|wygbe1: several roads to down one, as long as declarer assumes s has all the trumps|pg||
nt|yuval10: NS in the OR found the 6@d sac.|pg||
nt|roswolf: bd2 was flat when 4@S was also allowed to make|pg||
nt|fokal: on 6@h it seems clear to me that north couldn't make a move|pg||
nt|star6ija: operator, please try to follow the moves more precisely|pg||
nt|cameron_1: flat borad|pg||
nt|mamos: multi|pg||
nt|ftpe: ew migth go to 4 he here|pg||
nt|h_karluk: in practice very hard to reach, given layout diamonds favorably placed|pg||
nt|chick: Hamdi, the LoTT was originally devised by Vernes.  Cohen and Bergen popularized it, and Lawrence is the one who wrote "I fought the Law ..." disputing it's value :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: unless Sweden gifts some seems Austria's this team couldn't scratch something useful|pg||
nt|haans: standard bidding in 2nd hand no 2@H|pg||
nt|yuval10: so "only" 5 imps to Austria|pg||
nt|mamos: i think youd want to be in game|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 5c has much chances if declare can manage the 4-0 split|pg||
nt|tomi2:  7@D could be in danger of some ruff, not likely, but why take the risc...|pg||
mb|1N|nt|peachy: 4H rolls now,, on lucky spade sit|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Although the K@S is right the K@D is wrong so 4@H is an excellent contract|pg||
nt|peachy: EW have a paying sacrifice, rare at Vul|pg||
nt|andersk: Might be possible to bid game here|pg||
nt|bagman: If North was confident that 4NT was RKCB in hearts, that was a good bid; no need to re-cue with 3@S|pg||
nt|fokal: but maybe S could (should ?) have bid something else than 6@h|pg||
nt|haans: the law is not the law just suggestions :)|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: another part score hand |pg||
nt|udo: guess after 3 NT Lauria gave him club A or King|pg||
nt|brolucius: If North has a club more and a diamond fewer, he would be delighted to hear of the @SK, which would give a second club discard.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: not guilty Maam :) i was living in an ocean away and the internet was not invented. i was just thirsty and eager to buy any foreign bridge book, thanks |pg||
mb|2S|nt|motu: 1N is 9+  with 4cMajor possible as you can see|pg||
nt|ftpe: ahh, not any longer :)|pg||
nt|chick: 1N should warn S off from doing anything unilaterally and dramatic :)|pg||
mb|d|nt|paulhac:  Isnt it 800?|pg||
nt|peachy: oops|pg||
nt|peachy: I think I need another cup of coffee!!!|pg||
nt|wygbe1: if n had just shown limit raise values for hearts, they would be in the easy 4h contract|pg||
nt|paulhac:  6@D is only on the K@D 50% almost|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Without a heart ruff|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 4 cards M 4th seat|pg||
nt|andersk: looks like NT has to be played by S, but 5@D makes|pg||
nt|h_karluk: quite gross dissortion|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT   for n/s looks normal|pg||
nt|athene: well, it was only good if he was confident and he knew his partner was confident it was, too :)|pg||
nt|athene: that is one strange double of 1@C|pg||
nt|bagman: In confusion, it's often a good idea to bid something, which can be passed )|pg||
nt|fokal: X from sementa seems artificial|pg||
nt|haans: why did S not bid 3@H|pg||
nt|xenya: my assignment was for Closed Room|pg||
mb|p|nt|rigas_karo: double is transfer for @h?|pg||
nt|fokal: some kind of transfer ?|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes'|pg||
nt|haans: believe it to much and you go wrong|pg||
mb|p|nt|boyklas: maybe|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: should be|pg||
nt|wygbe1: i really think it is wrong to make a neg x with a fit for opener's major, this auction is one example of why |pg||
nt|yuval10: if N bids 3NT here def. must find the @d lead/switch|pg||
nt|bagman: I have never declared a splinter, but my partners have on some occasions |pg||
nt|xenya: sorry private|pg||
mb|p|nt|udo: 1@H is transfer ?|pg||
nt|lesh: well a trouble for S now|pg||
pc|hK|nt|rigas_karo: i think anastasiadis will claim 7 tricks here..|pg||
nt|rnmalik: can NS make a slam?|pg||
nt|andersk: @C lead|pg||
pc|h2|nt|collins64: after minor opening and opponent's double they play transfer|pg||
nt|yuval10: 5@c is cold, so many imps here on the line perhaps|pg||
nt|MolvaM: hands seem to be quiet, compared to the previous match|pg||
pc|h9|nt|boyklas: take 5D, 1S, 1H and leave|pg||
nt|lmeili: though 6@d makable, i would prefer for 3N|pg||
nt|tomi2:  they are on their way to 6@D it seems :)|pg||
nt|motu: 4@D is aceasking|pg||
nt|tomi2:  not 4@C?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: no matter @c lead|pg||
nt|andersk: @C A AQ in @S and @H J|pg||
nt|haans: 5@D jump may be based on previous bidding|pg||
nt|MolvaM: no 7600 distribution so far :)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  sry was away for a bid there:)|pg||
nt|ftpe: well ew had play for 4 hearts, but ns bougth contract in 2 cl on 4-3 fit|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|eweber: Imp scoring doesn't seem to work, 5 Imps for Russia until Board 4, if I count correctly|pg||
nt|h_karluk: quickly jettison loser|pg||
pc|cA|nt|motu: 4@C would be aceasking for @S|pg||
nt|tomi2:  but is @S suit possible after not raising?|pg||
nt|lmeili: 4th step shows how many key cards?|pg||
nt|tomi2:  2+@Dq|pg||
nt|motu: 2+ trump Q|pg||
nt|lmeili: tx|pg||
nt|h_karluk: to spades|pg||
nt|h_karluk: overtakes K and enjoys|pg||
nt|roswolf: with the diamonds 3-2 no problem|pg||
nt|udo: must be|pg||
nt|udo: 11 tricks,, next:)|pg||
nt|brolucius: 1@H must have been a transfer but I cannot see anything about it on the conv-card that I have up.|pg||
pc|c4|nt|paulhac:  Best lead but he could have led anything|pg||
nt|MolvaM: u didnt miss much andreas|pg||
nt|andreasw:  great:)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: declarer tries to protect himself against the 2 diamond honors being offside|pg||
nt|MolvaM: so he just gave up a heart trick that he could establish by taking his @hA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes it is, X would have shown hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They play transfers after interference|pg||
nt|udo: last time i played them ( San Remo),, they played transfers|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think a tad stretched 2@s works better than X there|pg||
pc|c8|nt|MolvaM: the computer dealt hands makes everyone paranoid a little bit after a while|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: good starting duck by S in  trick 1 |pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|bagman: AK and a low heart?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|motu: everything is possible here:)|pg||
nt|athene: just the five obvious tricks to lose here|pg||
pc|hA|nt|eweber: no miracle in the 4@h contract, but an imp for Russia anyway|pg||
nt|tomi2:  so 1 kexcard is missing and they stop in (a bad) game - I am no fan of this auction...|pg||
nt|chick: or a simple 2@H overcall|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|lmeili: at least it makes even guess wrong @s|pg||
pc|d9|nt|h_karluk: just needs to play a trump|pg||
nt|h_karluk: say East played Ace and switched back to @c|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ruff with K|pg||
nt|athene: red ace-kings and a diamond ruff|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: no entrys in West to develope the @D |pg||
nt|h_karluk: well aren't we ready to play at least 3 level in any suit ? |pg||
nt|chick: EW potentially had 3N, so a disaster for NS is not a given|pg||
nt|lesh: a possible 800, South has to be careful|pg||
pc|dA|nt|collins64: about the previous deal, you always have to discuss before is it or not GF 4@c overcall after weak 2@h opening|pg||
nt|MolvaM: now he can do his throw in|pg||
pc|d5|nt|h_karluk: @h A  favorably placed|pg||
nt|MolvaM: which he didnt need actually :)|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|athene: no chance for the defence to get a trump promotion going and i don't see why declarer should take a backwards trump finesse|pg||
nt|xenya: S showed 5-4 in the minors, but clubs could longer than diamonds, so N had to guess -- hence his pass over 2@C|pg||
pc|cK|nt|collins64: West had a very nice hand with 19HCP and East Pass with 2 Kings and a 7-card Q10 suit|pg||
nt|rnmalik: oops|pg||
nt|haans: we all see the clubs finesse|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c6|pg||
nt|andersk: wrong slam|pg||
nt|andersk: normal line|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 10 @C could come in play |pg||
pc|hJ|nt|collins64: x Kxx Q10xxxxx KJ|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: if 4@c is not GF easts is reasonable however, he thinks the hand is a misfit, and his K@h can be a wasted value|pg||
nt|andersk: a lucky make|pg||
nt|andersk: since @H K is together with 3 card @S|pg||
nt|rnmalik: no on a @H finesse can make 7. @D lead would force him to take a finesse.|pg||
nt|andersk: I must be sleeping, 6 is alw cold|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: Sorry for the rush for the previous deql now we are align with the players|pg||
nt|rnmalik: ok and thanks.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but still may go down|pg||
nt|davidb: board  6  was classical  SPL   -suit preference lead -  high H for D |pg||
nt|ady: ooops     Patchman trying to protect possible entry and clear the hearts|pg||
nt|andreasw:  ok 9 trick's |pg||
pc|h7|nt|motu: i do not see why E went beyond 3N since 2N shoed allready extras|pg||
nt|ziff:  Not easy to bid, as W may have 5 @D and @SA instead of KJ, making slam pretty good|pg||
nt|bagman: No trump promotion but the old fashioned tap|pg||
nt|bagman: Now a heart and ruff with 9 ?|pg||
nt|haans: best not is spades|pg||
nt|aldek: who should bid 4, east or west?|pg||
nt|rodvenn: not vulnerable you should, according to the law, always compete to the 3-level holding 8 against 8. They make, you go one down in the typical example|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Ivan needs subway tickets to enter the table and that doesn't help much|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ziff:  Hope springs eternal, as they say, but I agree that it was agressive|pg||
nt|athene: he is more likely to ruff with the queen surely|pg||
nt|MolvaM: but its good for discussions after the match with yr teammates: "I could have made it even if both @d honors were off"|pg||
nt|haans: Body in clubs very good|pg||
nt|rodvenn: of course you may feel that your hand has intermideate cards in their suit which makes you take another course|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|eweber: I don't count correcly, 4:1 is correct|pg||
nt|h_karluk: now trump promo possible|pg||
nt|bagman: what would you do then?|pg||
nt|cameron_1: i think they play the method 3m=non max lin linked M and 3M=max in other M|pg||
nt|mamos: I dont think West can    |pg||
nt|haans: endplay in hearts|pg||
pc|sT|nt|rnmalik: No @H finesse 6.|pg||
nt|andersk: East will get a trumph raise|pg||
nt|ftpe: will be poor result for ns i think|pg||
pc|h5|nt|andersk: unfortunate for the sweeds|pg||
nt|h_karluk: the declarer should play a trump to K before touching @h|pg||
nt|cameron_1: so it was up to tom|pg||
nt|udo: hm,,,,was this the best line?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|rnmalik: tricky hand after very good lead of @D. we have seen all cards so easy for us.:)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3@S in E is key to its making without finesse also which is % wise low.|pg||
nt|andersk: Austrians|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ruff and do that - now or never|pg||
nt|haans: and a make???|pg||
nt|h_karluk: not really|pg||
nt|h_karluk: if pitches and plays a trump to table goes down to @c shift|pg||
nt|h_karluk: if ruffs and plays a trump to hand always makes, thinner than a hair line|pg||
nt|haans: best play was not to cover|pg||
nt|Walddk12: Good morning to Peter Crouch|pg||
nt|xenya: quite poor, yes|pg||
nt|xenya: 2@D is certainly better, although i'm not sure it makes |pg||
nt|lesh: 500 now, against 4@h it is a good result|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|motu: with a decent hand and 5-5 W will make move over 3nt|pg||
nt|h_karluk: as we see all cards easy, i doubt same for him/her|pg||
pc|s7|nt|andreasw:  :) *i could*|pg||
nt|lesh: here is nothing East can do to prevent South from taking 3more spade tricks|pg||
pc|c7|pc|sJ|nt|ziff:  If 2N showed extras, yes|pg||
nt|mamos: same auction exactly in OR|pg||
nt|haans: well done|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|xenya: best he could do was play the @SQ|pg||
pc|d8|nt|h_karluk: that's off one|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: he is full off 10/9 cards fos Nt contract lovely deal |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|h_karluk: fifty fifty, 3 tricks for EW also|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ftpe: well|pg||
nt|ftpe: ew migthy bid 4 he|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|andersk: had to start with a small @D from dummy, to avoid truph promotion|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|haans: kick them when they are down|pg||
pc|d4|nt|xenya: 3 off now|pg||
pc|c2|pc|d7|pg||

mb|1C|nt|jillan:  well played and judged|pg||
mb|p|nt|jillan:  they played 4@S one down in the closed room|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mcphee: 4-6 and a 6 card suit might find them stopping below game|pg||
nt|jillan:  2@S shows 6@S and 0-4 points|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mcphee: 0-4|pg||
nt|mcphee: ty Rado:)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|othered1: so east has a relative maximum|pg||
nt|jillan:  the Bulgarians are starting to do very well here after a slow start|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mcphee: so at least 5 imps to Bulgaria|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h7|pg||
nt|mcphee: and a new leader|pg||
nt|othered1: by playing solid bridge, too|pg||

nt|collins64: if it is NF|pg||
nt|paulhac:  England takes the lead for the first time.|pg||
nt|andersk: unlucky board for the Austrians|pg||
nt|h_karluk: west still should refuse to overruff for a late trump promo possibility|pg||
nt|yuval10: and she did|pg||
nt|roswolf: overtrick imps to ireland|pg||
nt|bagman: sure, Q works when there is a legal chance for beat|pg||
nt|bagman: 9 works only as deception|pg||
nt|andreasw:  again board 4 is wrong!!!|pg||
nt|shevek: quite a few declarers went down in 3NT here|pg||
nt|MolvaM: andreas maybe you shld forget the past and move on :)|pg||
nt|xenya: strange -- perhaps the real play was different|pg||
nt|udo: i am not yet awake, but i doubt it|pg||
mb|1H|nt|roswolf: 2 suiter i think|pg||
nt|roswolf: they multi with a 1 suiter weak 2|pg||
nt|bagman: or is it actually so?|pg||
nt|andreasw:  neeeverrr:)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 3@c shows what?|pg||
nt|shevek: no, not from here !|pg||
nt|MolvaM: both minors?|pg||
nt|shevek: 3@c = 5-5 in the minors|pg||
nt|andreasw:  it should|pg||
mb|p|nt|collins64: another 2@c opening in North|pg||
nt|athene: will south double 2@H or bid 2@S?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|andersk: Italy running good in Bridge, but currently out of the world cup|pg||
nt|star6ija: 3N is possible here|pg||
nt|aldek: I'd say west should bid on the base of the quality of the spades, an ace and a singleton|pg||
nt|cameron_1: i agree|pg||
nt|andreasw:  i will go a few times and be back after 10 second's have to see score's from danaish match:)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  danish*|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 3nt would be nice if thomas knew about the @hK with partner|pg||
nt|MolvaM: good luck andreas|pg||
nt|andreasw:  5@d is also a winner:p|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: other room playing 5@D X also on hand nº 5|pg||
nt|udo: or was it best saftey for 10|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I would be reluctant to question any line by Lauria :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|collins64: both majors at least 44|pg||
nt|boyklas: i think he judged that the hand shouldnt be to game with the singleton S and the KH wasted value after showing C+S|pg||
nt|bagman: If partner has Txx left, both the 9 and the Q work; what about other holdings?|pg||
nt|ftpe: boring cards again|pg||
mb|2C|nt|star6ija: stubborn @s stopper|pg||
nt|haans: 14-16 nt|pg||
nt|psridhar: is South's pass forcing? |pg||
nt|udo: me too,,,therefore i asked only:)|pg||
nt|othered1: for 10 tricks, I don't see better|pg||
nt|brolucius: The players in the Open Room are not exactly burning the baize with their playing speed, They are three boards behind already.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 7 boards and 24 IMPs exchanged, interesting|pg||
mb|p|nt|jameslee 2: East a take out 2@D on a dangerous 1Nt X|pg||
nt|lesh: probably E will bid 2@s or 2@h|pg||
mb|2S|nt|paulhac:  IF East had been the overcaller one could say that Spain were unlucky|pg||
nt|h_karluk: well, sorry i disagree that was unlucky|pg||
nt|roswolf: south will no doubt transfer and offer his pard a choice of games|pg||
nt|shevek: you can watch any match here :)  http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|andreasw:  thx mucht|pg||
nt|andreasw:  3@h slam invit?|pg||
nt|shevek: looks like it|pg||
nt|andreasw:  no best slam with @d AK out:)|pg||
nt|shevek: but 5@d is not a make|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 5d seems ok since defence cannot take their club ruff with a small trump|pg||
nt|rodvenn: Very good bridge to reach 5 @d in both rooms. |pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: or the score is wrong -- that happens from time to time|pg||
nt|lesh: but over 2@h West might blast to a game|pg||
mb|4S|nt|chick: don't think a major suit game is possible|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: 2NT might have been alerted, otherwise I don't understand it|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 5@d good|pg||
nt|shevek: actually might make|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: second X pass out |pg||
nt|psridhar: this can be set 800|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: quite  a few down -3/-4 could be the result|pg||
mb|p|nt|wygbe1: probably lebensohl|pg||
nt|santyclz: The 6@h+1 ended as a push.  Neither n/s was able to overcome the preempt.|pg||
nt|star6ija: happens... :)|pg||
nt|shevek: yes|pg||
nt|haans: easier to play 2@D doubles not game sore if make|pg||
nt|psridhar: if defense can find the club ruff-they will get plenty of opportunities for the ruff|pg||
mb|p|nt|lesh: well looks like over 2@s as well :)|pg||
nt|chick: perhaps with a club finesse to dump a heart, this could make|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ftpe: he will try ruff 2 di at hand|pg||
nt|lesh: the defence has to be careful|pg||
pc|s8|nt|eweber: in board 4 NL managed to win 4 by making 2@d, so 5:4 for them now|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Lebensohl or transfer Lebensohl. Transfer Lebensohl would show both monors|pg||
nt|peachy: even down 1, this be small gain for England|pg||
nt|peachy: and it could slip home|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Which is Jason and which is Justin?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ty|pg||
nt|chick: now very hard to make|pg||
nt|h_karluk: seems clubs hook needed|pg||
pc|s7|nt|haans: ERROR|pg||
nt|haans: no @C8|pg||
nt|h_karluk: operator, undo please|pg||
nt|haans: not|pg||
nt|mcarroll: All one way traffic at the moment|pg||
nt|haans: better :)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yep|pg||
nt|ady: 2 minor suit aces to lose|pg||
nt|shevek: can't score a ruff on top of AK|pg||
nt|lesh: he didnt has the entry ,however the small spade gave it|pg||
nt|h_karluk: then ruff hearts and try devil's coup|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|athene: the auction in the other room looks like an interesting twist on leaping michaels - you bid 4 of the minor you haven't got|pg||
nt|athene: that is perhaps sensible if you play the bids as forcing|pg||
nt|bagman: Thx all. I need to go now, see you again.|pg||
nt|bagman: bye|pg||
nt|santyclz: Thanks Pekka.|pg||
nt|athene: bye thanks|pg||
pc|h2|nt|eweber: quite many warm up boards so far|pg||
nt|haans: @HK good play|pg||
nt|chick: really?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|collins64: @s to the J and it's over|pg||
nt|wygbe1: that lead may allow it to slip home|pg||
nt|andreasw:  so 11 trick's:)|pg||
nt|shevek: yes|pg||
nt|MolvaM: it seems the 5-5 minor gadget worked for the wales pair|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 3nt could well go down on spade lead|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|athene: it looks at first as though declarer might be able to hold his losers to two trumps from here, if he guesses right, but there's just too much work to do, i suppose|pg||
nt|lesh: well the declarer didnt want to take advantage|pg||
nt|chick: hehe|pg||
pc|d4|nt|star6ija: 12 tricks may be taken now|pg||
nt|haans: @S7 count even|pg||
pc|d9|nt|paulhac:  This looks like the only lead to give the contract|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Thanks Paul|pg||
nt|paulhac:  We think Justin is East|pg||
nt|haans: all cards from for Austria but no score i believe|pg||
nt|shevek: not if declarer ducks once?|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes he sould still go down|pg||
nt|andreasw:  would*|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d3|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ziff:  We can see that the contract is cold, but declarer can see only 8 tricks|pg||
nt|athene: ok, this is just doing his work for him|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d5|nt|rigas_karo: nothing else here i think, @s to the K and claim|pg||
nt|collins64: yes West need to lead A@h to beat the contract|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: there is nothing he can do if @s are 4-1|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|hA|nt|brolucius: Declarer would have had time to set up the clubs after a heart lead from West.|pg||
nt|tomi2:  for me it is quite impressive how many teams did not bid the grand in 6 till now|pg||
pc|h3|nt|tomi2:  bulgaria in 5@D, Norway in 6@D|pg||
nt|othered1: east doesn'thave the most comfortable of pitches|pg||
pc|h7|nt|lesh: going down now|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|boyklas: claim|pg||
nt|lmeili: pretty safe to win @hA if the lead from 4th, set up a @d trick as 9th |pg||
nt|xenya: 9 tricks now on a cross ruff|pg||
nt|chick: so a grosvenor duck by N sets this :)|pg||
pc|hT|nt|athene: spade force looked the natural play - perhaps Duboin was worried about forcing declarer too much and helping him into a trump coup against north's known heart length|pg||
nt|haans: Fallenius do not like it :(|pg||
nt|psridhar: Fredin must be ruing his decision to upgrade his hand to 1NT opening|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|boyklas: i think its not reasonable to lead the AH|pg||
nt|collins64: for sure|pg||
nt|ftpe: solid play|pg||
pc|s9|nt|rigas_karo: certainly not!|pg||
nt|haans: flat|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|tomi2:  San Marino should agree on their 2/1 follow ups too, 3@D was not a great score|pg||
pc|dT|nt|udo: 5 imps italy in board 5,,,NS bid on to 5 @S ,,against the probably making 5@C|pg||

nt|jillan:  this went 2 down. But what about 5@C?|pg||
nt|mcphee: strange finding 5@D after N showed @C in the other room|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1D|mb|1S|nt|othered1: South put the pressure on in the CR, but EW have to scramble to make 3 (easy as cards lie)|pg||

nt|mcphee: 5@C looks cold|pg||
nt|barnets: it is|pg||
nt|jillan:  so a chance for Norway to get sompoints back|pg||
mb|d|mb|1N|nt|barnets: i tthink they will find it if north bids clubs|pg||

nt|jillan:  yes S has no reason to jump away here|pg||
nt|othered1: 5@C is cold and EW need to cash to hold it, double dummy at least.|pg||

mb|3D|nt|othered1: seems to give the opponents tons of room|pg||
mb|3S|mb|4C|mb|p|nt|othered1: pointed out that 1N would go down 7|pg||

mb|5C|nt|barnets: now brogeland has a chance|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: great bid|pg||

nt|barnets: 2-0 holland|pg||
nt|jillan:  and maybe EW could have made it a bit harder for them?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|othered1: But a lawful 3-level bid by east may have made it difficult to find @C if south rebids @D at 4-level|pg||

pc|s8|pc|sK|pc|sT|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sJ|nt|mcphee: so 11 imps into Norway basket|pg||

nt|lmeili: that was a heavy penalty!|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: If I have good information they finish 20 minutes late in that match|pg||
nt|tomi2:  10 VP for 20 minutes? thats a lot|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: restarting here|pg||
nt|athene: which means duboin can't have had a count on the diamonds - if he knew declarer had four he would have bashed out that @S10 like a shot|pg||
nt|athene: the standard counter to a 2-suiter being to force declarer|pg||
nt|andreasw:  then a @d to ace and a @s back |pg||
nt|haans: yes dirty upscore|pg||
nt|psridhar: might hv worked on some other layout |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: yes 800 always dangerous|pg||
nt|lesh: here we go :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 5@c/@d ok|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: israel made 3nt on bd 4 for another game swing|pg||
nt|ady: partial here in spades   Ireland need to keep low|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes may well get too high|pg||
nt|psridhar: Fredin will briefly consider 3nt b4 bidding 4s when he finds out his pd has unbal hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: There was no follow-up to discuss. North jumped to 3@D, South thought it was a WJS and passed|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: apparently the rooms are connected now|pg||
nt|Gerben42: white vs red NS are very agressive, but as we have seen vuln. they are middle of the road|pg||
nt|eweber: 3@s is not exactly what you'd dream of with the South hand...|pg||
nt|Gerben42: best to not dream but pass with a happy face|pg||
nt|eweber: I assume West is the one who is taking his time here|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Great to see the Irish at the top of the leader board|pg||
nt|josj: as far as I know, they were about 30 mins. late and were eventually fined 3 VP each|pg||
nt|tomi2:  getting informed that they got 3 VP back each|pg||
nt|tomi2:  thx|pg||
nt|athene: ok :)|pg||
nt|aldek: England on the board|pg||
nt|andreasw:  @d to king and alot of @s trick's|pg||
nt|shevek: south can only get in once (@dK)|pg||
nt|ftpe: that opening will probably bring them to 6 spades|pg||
nt|xenya: on 7, the Estonian EW in the other room got to 4@H -- not a bad contract really, but down on foul trump split -- 1 down and 7 imps to Russia|pg||
nt|ftpe: in 6 spades he has to guess spade queen, but best chance is playing on sp 2-2|pg||
nt|haans: 10-13|pg||
mb|1D|nt|mcarroll: Unfortunate lie of the cards, but will be the same in the other room  one assumes|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hmmm?|pg||
nt|athene: my guess is they put the board on the table upside down|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hand reversed?|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: ty vugragher |pg||
mb|1S|nt|boyklas: FG raise with D?|pg||
nt|boyklas: or 14+ Bal?|pg||
nt|haans: that 1@S overcall???|pg||
nt|xenya: i don't think 6@S is such a great contract -- problems in spades and diamonds|pg||
nt|ftpe: agree, but they will get there after ligth open, |pg||
nt|xenya: well the 3@H bid makes it easier to solve the spade problem|pg||
nt|haans: Fredit pass??????|pg||
nt|udo: Ed,Tomi,Roland,,thks so far,,,have to leave for work:)  would like to stay here..|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thanks Udo|pg||
mb|2C|nt|ftpe: after 3 he better chance to play north for Qxx in sp|pg||
nt|haans: ERROR|pg||
nt|brolucius: Work? What is that?|pg||
nt|tomi2:  then they should discuss their first round of bidding as well :)|pg||
mb|2D|nt|collins64: 2NT is GF with @d|pg||
nt|collins64: GF with 4+ @d|pg||
nt|boyklas: 6D makes here|pg||
nt|collins64: 3NT 12-14 balance|pg||
nt|boyklas: with the AH in his place|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: difficult decision for South here|pg||
nt|andersk: 3 NT?|pg||
nt|peachy: operator doing great job, keeping up with the fairly fast pace at the table|pg||
nt|pitiful:  4@h not timid|pg||
nt|xenya: yes|pg||
nt|udo: i will send u an E-Mail, david|pg||
nt|brolucius: Thx.|pg||
nt|lesh: what might appeared to be a sacrifice for N/S it will be a makable game :)|pg||
nt|chick: 3@D is enough|pg||
nt|lesh: they need to find @c support|pg||
nt|lesh: 1@d has to be alerted I think|pg||
nt|lesh: they play prec :)|pg||
mb|5D|nt|rigas_karo: it is safe to bid once again but |pg||
nt|rnmalik: very tempting:)|pg||
nt|mamos: good pressure from South|pg||
nt|othered1: Bye, Udo.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i choose 3@h cue here|pg||
nt|chick: right, 3@C is a better bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|collins64: if Mike bid 4@d, Isabelle 4@h they'll play 6@d|pg||
nt|eweber: if anyone of the players|pg||
nt|yuval10: not everyone's X perhaps|pg||
nt|ady: this might cause Irland to get too high|pg||
mb|p|nt|rigas_karo: 4@d or 4NT?|pg||
nt|roswolf: the boards have been swingy - Italy - slovakia 46-0 after 4 boards shows how|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Vul, not for the fainthearted!|pg||
nt|mamos: at least a couple off|pg||
nt|cameron_1: but flat vs. 3@s so|pg||
nt|cameron_1: flatish|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes but N takes the firsst @D trick|pg||
nt|MolvaM: good stop|pg||
nt|andreasw:  first|pg||
nt|xenya: no slam now -- just collecting your money i think...|pg||
mb|p|nt|andersk: opps|pg||
nt|andersk: cold 4 @H|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 4@H +1|pg||
nt|athene: not sure i like unusual 2nt with 6@D4@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: :)|pg||
nt|athene: partner usually bids clubs with equal length which isn't at all what you want|pg||
nt|athene: notice how south can't bid stayman intending 2@S (sign-off) over 2@D|pg||
nt|athene: they obviously play that as something cunning|pg||
nt|athene: we have seen they have lots of relay auctions after stayman so you do lose the ability to bid it on rubbish hands|pg||
nt|shevek: 8 declarer made 3N and 8 went down|pg||
nt|shevek: declarers|pg||
nt|MolvaM: so it must have been a 50% contract :)|pg||
nt|shevek: true, needs accurate defence|pg||
nt|shevek: lol  murat|pg||
nt|xenya: or... who knows?|pg||
nt|lesh: he has to guess Q@d now, but it is difficult and probably -2|pg||
pc|sK|nt|pitiful:  some play middle encourages and high or low sp in this situation|pg||
nt|shevek: to be fair some went down in 6@d :)|pg||
pc|sT|nt|collins64: he made the wrong choice|pg||
nt|boyklas: all the problems comes here for S because he doesnt know the H or the C Quebid|pg||
nt|boyklas: and he make go down even a 5D|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: at least the did well to avoid 6NT :)|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: 5@d by North is safe|pg||
nt|collins64: Belgium is back after the previous deal|pg||
nt|collins64: Dehaye weak NT forced them to play 4@h for one down|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: very weak NT :)|pg||
nt|boyklas: Manolis choosed to play at the 5-3 fit and not at the 4-4, firstly was thinking that he is playing at th 5-4 fit|pg||
nt|collins64: the bidding was 1NT 8-11 Pass 3@c X and he bid 4@h with his 5-card Q@h and his 4-card 8@s|pg||
nt|ady: they might make this  getting 3 diamond tricks|pg||
nt|lesh: A@s and @d switch|pg||
nt|h_karluk: straightforward play also possible|pg||
nt|chick: against the odds to drop the @DQ, but W may lead trump now to protect against a spade ruff|pg||
pc|sA|nt|dburn: perhaps he should have signalled for a heart|pg||
nt|aldek: and now @DQ|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|collins64: did he actually play the K@h|pg||
nt|boyklas: i dont think so.|pg||
nt|andersk: probably @H 9 lead|pg||
nt|rnmalik: suit worth bidding is worth leading.:)|pg||
nt|haans: most would say "thats not fair"|pg||
nt|davidb: should make on the  D suit |pg||
nt|athene: if north has a pretty good penalty pass here unless he thinks the double is really really offensive|pg||
nt|santyclz: The "DNPA" (does not promise anything) stayman has a lot going for it, but gives up a lot on big hands.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Entame atout - et bonne chance...|pg||
nt|haans: @H to ace to avoid @S ruff|pg||
pc|d4|nt|rigas_karo: strange|pg||
nt|andersk: should make now|pg||
nt|paulhac:  And the other room is 2 boards ahead|pg||
nt|andersk: the famous "almost 1k"  +990|pg||
nt|roswolf: i am told gib says the game can make -in practice i am confident it wont|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Sorry - trump lead - and good luck, I meant|pg||
nt|star6ija: 8+points, 5+@hs|pg||
nt|chick: OR, E could make a brilliant overtake of the spades and lead a trump :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: if ther declarer decided to play straightforward that doesn't make a sense|pg||
nt|chick: unfortunately, that gives away the location of the @DQ, so S might just try for the drop now|pg||
nt|h_karluk: *the|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|peachy: so even faster there|pg||
nt|ady: problem is the tap with the clubs|pg||
nt|star6ija: :)|pg||
nt|haans: claiming time|pg||
nt|lesh: well East is forced to switch to @d, having or no @d|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mcarroll: Although playing safe after the double 4 is the probable outcome|pg||
nt|psridhar: actually 3nt is superior cont-4s may fail if h ace was wrong|pg||
nt|othered1: Lauria and Versace seem not to have adopted the modern support double.|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Possibility only if declarer guesses the entry to W hand.|pg||
nt|athene: Mari shamefacedly trying to shift some diamonds in with his clubs, courtesy of a black pen|pg||
nt|brolucius: Speculative double from East.|pg||
nt|othered1: Their doubles show extras, I believe.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They prefer to use double for something else. One can survive without support doubles you know|pg||
nt|tomi2:  eas has @CAQ in their opened suit, @DA, @SQ and partner made a constructive call vulnerable|pg||
nt|brolucius: Kibitzers suggest lead-directing double (similar to Lightner). But not obvious to me, nor to West.|pg||
nt|lesh: Q@D :)|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|hawe45:  This trick is VERY important, North|pg||
nt|othered1: I survive very well without them in almost all partnerships that don't have hours to discuss their ramifications.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|yuval10: nice guess by declarer|pg||
nt|davidb: D to the 9 = 10 tricks|pg||
pc|s4|nt|xenya: down 4 if W just cashes his high cards now|pg||
nt|ftpe: wow, 3 he in open room :)|pg||
nt|xenya: he will have to do it sooner or later |pg||
nt|ftpe: + 50 not much when close to 1430|pg||
nt|xenya: well E didn't open there, and that made all the difference |pg||
nt|psridhar: not after the X of course|pg||
nt|haans: yep 3nt a make|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Ouf|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ady: I think can be made playing a diamond to the 9 after Q@S|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes intra finesse position|pg||
nt|pitiful:  still a nice pick up for n-s|pg||
nt|pitiful:  even without the double|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|nt|athene: still 800|pg||
nt|ftpe: rigth|pg||
nt|xenya: of course, you could argue that EW might have got in later in the auction, but it's easier to say...|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But less than 500 will be difficult|pg||
pc|c9|nt|xenya: by the way, i think the E hand is an opener|pg||
pc|cT|nt|mcarroll: Back to +1 after no trump shift|pg||
nt|haans: do not like this |pg||
nt|h_karluk: push next board please|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|Walddk2: Be careful Ed, David may have to look that word up too|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer has three minor-suit stoppers to knock out.|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|rnmalik: In the OR K@D was led.|pg||
nt|chick: yes but not forced to overtake the @S, that he would do only if a @D lead was needed from E|pg||
mc|9|nt|davidb: normal finesse..|pg||

nt|hawe45:  Aarathon, better|pg||

nt|mcarroll: Preempting pd |pg||
nt|star6ija: 4@hs on the horizon|pg||

nt|lesh: *@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2:  still waiting for first German imp - very good bridge by Bulgaria so far - they are one of the favorites for a medal for sure!|pg||
nt|roswolf: sympathy|pg||
nt|athene: one thing worth a quick mention about that last hand - people who like to pass initially and then balance if opps' bidding dies out at a low level - it's really not as safe as it's ...|pg||
nt|athene: made out to be|pg||
nt|mamos: half way and England supporters are hoping for a better second half|pg||

nt|chick: that's an interesting idea ... E try to look like he wants a @C ruff :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: however 3rd seat, why not|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ady: you assume Geoffrey east has discarded winning clubs holding K@D?|pg||
nt|haans: asking for transfer|pg||
nt|star6ija: and 4@h by the West|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: S is in the dark now.....|pg||
nt|MolvaM: passed hand 3@h promises @s support I believe|pg||
nt|shevek: yes, what I call "a fit-showing non-jump"  :)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: wales got 10 imp from the 5@d hand|pg||
nt|lesh: South needs to pass now|pg||
nt|h_karluk: pass saves the day|pg||
nt|lesh: he doesnt have the Aces to raise ,but ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 3@s didn't promise a rose garden|pg||
mb|p|nt|motu: 2@H = 11-14 6+@H or 5@H + 4c minore|pg||
nt|Walddk12: Bocchi landed 6@H on this deal after a top diamond lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: if P has a trick in @c, say KQ , and a singel @d so 5@h means -1 over -1|pg||
nt|yuval10: *might means, to be exact...if a @h goes through, which is not|pg||
nt|davidb: I have  sympathy  as well  as an Israeli..|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: seem we are playing a tennis match noty a bridg match 3/0 still after 6 boards |pg||
nt|chick: nah, 3@S is a clear preempt, S has nothing to carry it on|pg||
pc|d3|nt|rnmalik: support X.|pg||
nt|Walddk12: There is a legitimate line. Bocchi did not find it, but the defence erred|pg||
nt|MolvaM: a very terminologic approach shevek :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i bet with a constructive hand Vladimir would be able to give much tempting calls|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|haans: 1@H mostly bal |pg||
nt|roswolf: well in the heat of battle anything can happen|pg||
nt|xenya: i think EW have said all they had to say -- now it's NS's turn|pg||
pc|d2|nt|eweber: this may have been another 2 Imps for NL|pg||
nt|athene: just because opps don't have game values between them doesn't mean they can't crucify you at the 3-level|pg||
nt|lesh: an easy -1 |pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|haans: poles toughts us this|pg||
nt|pitiful:  not many would not want to show that @h suit|pg||
nt|xenya: but pass by S looks clear now|pg||
nt|brolucius: Attitude leads against NT, so the low club shows a suit that will be worth pursuing.|pg||
nt|othered1: would south have taken the same line without the double, which pretty strongly put the @CQ offside?.|pg||
nt|lesh: @c switch is not that difficult|pg||
nt|lesh: or playing small :)|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cA|nt|peachy: 1H showed spades|pg||
nt|ziff:  This could be tricky...|pg||
pc|c7|nt|boyklas: long suit game try, and accept with 4-3-3-3|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|pitiful:  maybe 4@h would not be natural for n-s|pg||
pc|c3|nt|santyclz: It's particularly unsafe to balance when the opponents haven't shown a fit.|pg||
nt|tomi2:  I am just thinking about how the play went, if GromÃ¶ller ducked @DA two times|pg||
pc|c9|nt|haans: do not believe in 4@S|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 3NT, 5@C,2@D, 2@S losing 4 @H|pg||

nt|rnmalik: Interesting hand but difficult to bid 6.|pg||
nt|andersk: interesting hand, slam possible to make (@C lead puts a pressure on declearer)|pg||
nt|eweber: I assume we still have the 5:4, but not sure about board 7|pg||
nt|tomi2:  hard to follow the cardplay, but operator, pls try to be sure about the number of tricks they made :)|pg||
nt|haans: again :(|pg||
nt|roswolf: a real solo flight of fancy|pg||
nt|hawe45:  3 NT???|pg||
nt|athene: unusual to play 3nt with a 5-3 spade fit and both hands unbalanced|pg||
nt|MolvaM: declarer could be in difficulties if trumps were 4-1|pg||
nt|lesh: possible 1nt contract now|pg||
nt|chick: a lot of swings, but still staying a close match :)|pg||
nt|lesh: and more boards to go :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 50 % tie, let's wait|pg||
nt|h_karluk: aha, 29-24, score changed BG new leader|pg||
mb|1D|nt|athene: my guess is 3nt was "serious" and also "seriously misunderstood"|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 4@S contract ohter room hand nº 7 |pg||
mb|d|nt|ady: just 2 aces  in a spades contract|pg||
nt|andreasw:  3nt is makeable here|pg||
nt|xenya: another 10-point opener -- also quite reasonable i think|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 4@S hand nº 8|pg||
nt|haans: natural of balanced hand|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: the 800 hand |pg||
mb|1N|nt|roswolf: hmm a 4 card major opening|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: seems to be turning into a rout. 57 imps in the bag and probably another 11 from board 10, so68-0 at half-time?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 58 excuse me|pg||
nt|haans: we must assume pen dbl not possible|pg||
nt|yuval10: lebensohl now, i persume|pg||
nt|star6ija: partscore board again|pg||
nt|MolvaM: at this point, iceland and italy are the runaway leaders of the group|pg||
nt|ftpe: agree|pg||
nt|othered1: 1N 11-13|pg||
nt|lesh: whoever bids it - plays it :)|pg||
nt|chick: seems like a clearcut pass to me :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|boyklas: at the OR 2H is playing|pg||
nt|pitiful:  4@s looks a possible spot here|pg||
nt|xenya: but N's 2@D looks ugly to me|pg||
mb|d|nt|yuval10: guess not|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Hre we are - allez les bleus|pg||
nt|athene: some people think the double jump after t/o double should be pre-emptive|pg||
nt|athene: others play it as limit bid; i.e. better than single jump|pg||
nt|athene: clearly Mari is in the second camp|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 2@S by EW?|pg||
nt|xenya: 4@D is 4 down|pg||
nt|psridhar: 1c opening with 2cl and 5 dia?|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: South could reopen the bidinng with 1nt =9-14|pg||
nt|tomi2:  in the OR Sementa did not put so much trust in parters overcall and bid 5@H vuln with that 3.5 defensive tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  13 tricks possible at any lead, I think - taking for given, that the @D-finesse is working |pg||
nt|MolvaM: 22VP ahead of the 3rd ranked france|pg||
mb|p|nt|andersk: 2@HX is probably -2|pg||
nt|andersk: 3 NT makes tho|pg||
nt|andreasw:  E-w in trouble here|pg||
mb|p|nt|rigas_karo: impossible to guess the @c position here|pg||
nt|Gerben42: also flat |pg||
nt|peachy: transfer again in N|pg||
nt|haans: good body everywere|pg||
nt|shevek: 4NT two places to play|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: pass out easy to see how mauch|pg||
nt|tomi2:  but he was not doubled|pg||
pc|hT|nt|yuval10: 2NT from S most likely would've make her declarer, as N would've bided 3NT anyway|pg||

nt|h_karluk: Jivko, did u mean 1N by W?|pg||
nt|chick: 1N by anyone :)|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|shevek: 5@d = @d + @h|pg||
nt|shevek: a bit high here|pg||
pc|h2|nt|yuval10: at least 10 tricks here|pg||
nt|MolvaM: do we agree with the double of 4@s?|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: this will be down 1|pg||
nt|Gerben42: a perfect fit here|pg||
nt|star6ija: and 3@d|pg||
nt|star6ija: NS|pg||
nt|andreasw:  not at all|pg||
nt|xenya: but 4@H should be easy|pg||
pc|s6|nt|andersk: looks like the names have been corrected|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Is it true?:)|pg||
nt|mamos: lots of work|pg||
nt|pitiful:  DG will need to guess the trump suit|pg||
nt|mamos: that lead directing opening has resulted in the best lead|pg||
nt|pitiful:  yes a good effort by north|pg||
nt|pitiful:  some might pass the north hand surprisingly|pg||
pc|sK|nt|rnmalik: The contract I mean.|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: that's what I got from thr CR|pg||
nt|athene: if east suspects the 1@H is a psyche he can't be so sure about the diamond finesse|pg||
nt|shevek: I would pass every time|pg||
nt|brolucius: One heart loser goes on the @CA, so slam depends on picking up the trump. But no reason to think they will bid it.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|paulhac:  With the clubs 3-3 there is no obvious defence|pg||
nt|h_karluk: have no idea why did not touch spades before diamonds|pg||
nt|andersk: SVK- ITA 2-1|pg||
nt|andersk: 10 min left|pg||
nt|haans: i think he did not have a clue were @SJ was :)|pg||
nt|athene: but more likely it's just a shaded opener|pg||
nt|othered1: EW's card mentions "distributional asking relays," which may be in effect here.|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|boyklas: he may play well the S, if he play small to the A and see the KS drops he can play small to T now the JXX cant be played|pg||
nt|andreasw:  me to|pg||
nt|lesh: well I supposed a pass by South but when he opened N/S ended in 1nt :)|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ady: claim soon|pg||
nt|star6ija: trump lead is the best for EW|pg||
nt|lesh: so they were first to bid it:)|pg||
pc|c8|nt|star6ija: well done|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|Gerben42: making many tricks|pg||
nt|shevek: at least!  :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: You might not get a heart lead.|pg||
nt|othered1: and east's cheapest bid style h ere surely looks like a relay auction.  Don't have translation,  however.|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|pitiful:  still if he did he would probably be on lead to 4@s anyway|pg||
nt|pitiful:  Gold would open Rolands favourite flannery|pg||
nt|mamos: yes there are two "f" words we mustnt mention this week|pg||
nt|pitiful:  I am rather depressed by the scoreline, hopefully our dutch friends will start doing something wrong soon|pg||
nt|haans: 9-11 as first passed|pg||
pc|c5|nt|andreasw:  lol|pg||
pc|c9|nt|boyklas: he made it|pg||
pc|c2|nt|tomi2:  I guess west showed 4 3 2 4 :)|pg||
nt|chick: W could have overcalled 1N and been first :)|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: belguim picked up another 8 imps in board 10|pg||
nt|collins64: no|pg||
nt|boyklas: why no?|pg||
nt|mamos: Gold doesnt have many clues as to the outstanding values|pg||
nt|brolucius: And other chances when someone holds @SQ-x-x. Yes, it is a good slam.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: new strawberried peanut butter M&M time |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|collins64: why A@c|pg||
nt|haans: well played|pg||
nt|pitiful:  still at least we are better than them at football|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s7|nt|hawe45:  Carefully played to discard a @H|pg||
nt|cameron_1: are you sure?|pg||
nt|mamos: South holding @HK makes it morelikely that North has @sK   but still needs to finesse 10|pg||
nt|othered1: But NS will  have an exact description of west hand and west will be declarer so @H lead very likely from both sides.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Well done to bid it!|pg||
nt|tomi2:  lauria will lead @HK with his likely trump trick|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|pitiful:  that was just to see how many messages I would get :)|pg||
nt|pitiful:  quite a few|pg||
nt|pitiful:  ...|pg||
nt|mamos: i think you should stick to Bridge Peter|pg||
nt|pitiful:  and no I do not play for Spurs|pg||
nt|pitiful:  perhaps I need to put that in my profile|pg||
nt|dburn: his problem is that he thinks (from the opening bid) that North has the ace of clubs|pg||
nt|pitiful:  this is very tough for TT|pg||
nt|pitiful:  DG sorry|pg||
nt|dburn: in which case he needs to cater for the possibility that North will play the fourth round of diamonds|pg||
nt|dburn: so perhaps he will cash hearts, hoping to pitch West's remaining diamond|pg||
nt|dburn: of course, if he had played a low heart to the queen instead of running the jack, as he probably should have done, he would have a quick entry to dummy now|pg||
nt|ftpe: yes|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cA|nt|mcarroll: Trump continuing the good work|pg||
nt|MolvaM: next question. do you agree with 4nt?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: with 4-4=|pg||
nt|andreasw:  i would pass|pg||
nt|shevek: as I said, I would pass in all positions  lol|pg||
nt|andreasw:  :)|pg||
nt|tomi2:  @C lead would be fatal, but I can't imagine this|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so Jivko, just curiosity, you didn't consider 1N overcall by W?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|jameslee 2: 8 more for Israel so score 11/2|pg||
nt|psridhar: that dia 3 by Fredin in the 3rd round of dia=sps for h ( 2 for cl and 4 for spd)- obediently Fallenius shifts to H for d2 wd|pg||
nt|tomi2:  west will take his time to think of the best play in trumps|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, double dummy he can make it, but the players don't have the hand records|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|haans: now he must try spades|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h9|pc|hK|nt|hawe45:  Claim|pg||
nt|dburn: but he would doubtless have used that to play for North to hold @sKx rather than @sK10x|pg||
nt|lesh: it depends on their methods and the decision of the player. 1NT could be 5@c and 4M, or as here he prefered DBL instead of overcalling 1nt as 15-17|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|shevek: flat hand, give it a go, sure pass|pg||
nt|h_karluk: oh that makes sense, thanks|pg||
nt|lesh: I dont know how E/W play 1nt overcall|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|rnmalik: 10 tricks. No damage done.|pg||
pc|sT|nt|rnmalik: sorry-11.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: There is no sane player who would insert the 10|pg||
nt|othered1: now west has to  hope that north also holds 4+@D to pitch both @H|pg||
nt|tomi2:  he will try for singleton king of clubs with south maybe ?;)|pg||
nt|brolucius: God is Italian in this room. But he will not be Italian in the other room, if they reach the good slam too.|pg||
nt|tomi2:  god was a German yesterday, that is quite fair :)|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s3|pg||
nt|star6ija: but seems declarer will prevail anyway|pg||
nt|pitiful:  crikey @s 10|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, if they disallow legitimate goals, it's not easy to win football matches|pg||

nt|jillan:  first rule of kibbitzing|pg||
nt|barnets: In wales italy west opened 2@D north bocci X east bid 6@C when it went back to B he bid 6@D X then back again 6@H|pg||
nt|othered1: 6@D is really excellent, since with @D split you have safety play in @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|jillan:  oh, action packed in the Italy Wales match. Juniors playing?|pg||
nt|barnets: east x this and he could not do the @Ds and went down1|pg||
nt|barnets: bocchi is that well known junior|pg||
nt|jillan:  yeah, like 30 years ago|pg||
nt|othered1: is 1N another Raptor-type?|pg||
nt|barnets: you cant make either red slam|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|nt|othered1: right but what are the odds against 6@D?|pg||
nt|jillan:  it is very well done to reach 6H with the S hand, |pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|nt|barnets: but you cant make it|pg||
nt|jillan:  if either red suit was divided more evenly, ithad some chance|pg||

mb|7H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jillan:  but looking at the NS hands would you think that EW hands are likely to be more evenly distributed?|pg||

nt|andreasw:  poland reach slam here just not 6@h but 6@d:)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|rnmalik: 3NT for Ns.|pg||
nt|tomi2:  in the OR Piekared prefered a double here to 2NT|pg||
nt|tomi2:  ending up as dummy in 2@D, not the contract he was dreaming of|pg||
nt|athene: i am not sure where they went wrong but clearly a wheel came off somewhere|pg||
nt|pitiful:  another lead directing bid|pg||
nt|dburn: I suspect the play went quickly at the end - some of those cards were doubltess not played to the same trick|pg||
nt|shevek: I just had a glimpse at the poles playing in 6@d|pg||
nt|shevek: you too :)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  :)|pg||
nt|lesh: I wonder what 1NT is|pg||
nt|chick: 3 suit takeout?|pg||
nt|lesh: I suppose N/S will land at least at 5th level, but then E/W might bid 6@c and then ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: say didn't begin w art 1@c, 3 aces outside, so that's DD slam of EW players, what a homework, ty teacher!|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: EW possibly in trouble now|pg||
nt|xenya: perhaps W was concerned about bad splits in the balck suits and 4-1 @Hs, but all was well|pg||
mb|3D|nt|andersk: Est overcalled 1 @S in open room, and South 2 @S, quite strange bidding, anyway NOrway playing 5 NT in open room|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Looks like 4@H should make|pg||
nt|tomi2:  Wladow knows about partnes @C qualitiy, so he won't lead a club now ;)|pg||
nt|mamos: Gold keeps his 1@D openers up to strength :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 5@C looks difficult with a trump trick and A@S off  and diamonds bottled up|pg||
mb|3H|nt|andersk: 2-2|pg||
nt|andersk: no|pg||
nt|andersk: offside|pg||
nt|andersk: incredible match on TV too:)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 6@d may have communication problems.... between parters :)|pg||
nt|lesh: probably 1nt was 3 suits and that's why North decided to pass over 3@d|pg||
nt|lesh: and possible 5@c bid by West now if 1nt is what we suppose to mean|pg||
mb|3S|nt|lesh: but still it will be very agressive |pg||
mb|p|nt|eweber: but still, with 210 and 170 on my score card I wouldn't feel to good, it may not cost but surely won't bring in...|pg||
nt|andersk: even more exsiteing then bbo|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT hopless if they lead hearts   |pg||
nt|andreasw:  lol|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: dangerous reopenning here |pg||
nt|psridhar: thin 4s for EW , a lucky make -but imposs to get there unless pushed|pg||
nt|haans: but most of us would|pg||
nt|psridhar: South does have a good hand, cant fault him for reopening|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: what will North try to bid ?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think a similar example was in one of Ian Fleming's 007 JB books|pg||
nt|h_karluk: trappy sample|pg||
nt|lesh: I dont think North will pass|pg||
nt|lesh: South has showed 0-5 and 6+ spades but ...|pg||
nt|chick: N's hand is far too good|pg||
nt|chick: almost slam in hand|pg||
nt|lesh: 4@h is making|pg||
nt|chick: only problem is ... can he overcome his fear of 4-1 or 4-2 trump split in a red suit|pg||
mb|3N|nt|paulhac:  Putting South to the test|pg||
nt|star6ija: 2@d game forcing|pg||
nt|tomi2:  he is mathematican and we often see him going for overtricks in games where he can go down, when he thinks odds are better than 95%|pg||
mb|d|nt|rigas_karo: maybe he thought declarer hand 6421|pg||
nt|andersk: same lead as open room, probably 11 and a push|pg||

nt|peachy: somebody took a long time, I assume|pg||

mb|p|nt|rnmalik: This board.|pg||
nt|peachy: and cant be but South|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|star6ija: 2N no 3@ss|pg||
nt|psridhar: note that S does not have values like unsupported king or queen sitting under the NT opener-he has a 'pure' hand|pg||
nt|chick: now a XX|pg||
nt|lesh: dangerous call|pg||
nt|chick: "pick another suit"|pg||
nt|lesh: he can even make 5@d|pg||
nt|lesh: 4@h and 5@d making but 3nt not |pg||
nt|chick: he can make 6H if he plays E for something like 4414 or 4405 ... losing 1 heart and no diamonds ... or am I missing something?|pg||
mb|4D|nt|paulhac:  E/wWhave done well to hold the loss to 5 Imps|pg||

nt|lesh: he can but it is impossible to bid|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i whispered he could pass to 3NX but seems was busy a lot and did not hear me|pg||
nt|chick: entry for @D finesse is a problem|pg||
nt|chick: and 6@C EW is makeable too, I think|pg||
nt|lesh: slams are makeable but it is diffucult to reach. |pg||
nt|chick: I dunno, I'd still keep trying to reach a red slam with N's hand|pg||
nt|lesh: from the bidding you know what 4@h are 4-1 at least and there is 4th @d in West|pg||
nt|chick: yes, that's what is scaring N into serious caution|pg||
nt|lesh: your partner is 0-5 points with 6+ spades|pg||
nt|lesh: you dont expect him have K@hxx and 109x in @d|pg||
nt|chick: and nothing wasted in @Ss :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|star6ija: still some communication problems|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: problems are arriving for N-S |pg||
nt|psridhar: but 3C x is painful all the same|pg||
mb|5C|nt|collins64: no Mike show count on J@d lead 7 cards so not possible |pg||
nt|MolvaM: to protect the @cQ and against bad breaks,|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: got of to a bad lead    but still defence can recover  South will need to play a low heart when in with A@S   and north will have to read the position|pg||
nt|star6ija: decided by the defense|pg||
nt|andreasw:  Magnusson in control here and chose 6@h|pg||
nt|tomi2:  if he exited with a heart, Versace could have won the Jack and give partner a @D ruff to "get back" the 2 imps Kirmse was working for, but we don't know the cards exactly|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: the lead was i think another sols flight of fancy|pg||
nt|shevek: good choice|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes had Mag bid a cue Harald would bid 6@d and Mag had to make a choise|pg||
nt|andreasw:  after 4nt from harald ofcourse|pg||
nt|MolvaM: spade lead?|pg||
nt|andreasw:  small @h lead but could cost the beating trick|pg||
nt|MolvaM: and then another spade (when in with @hA) could create problems|pg||
nt|andreasw:  i would lead the @c|pg||
nt|MolvaM: declarer must refrain from cashing diamonds|pg||
nt|lesh: opps|pg||
nt|chick: N did well not to double :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: okay, if the input is correct now i belived much to that old saying in BG. "The wolf has a thick neck, because he does his job on his own. "|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: :)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  worst lead would be @D|pg||
nt|lesh: that's better|pg||
nt|h_karluk: agreed|pg||
pc|dA|nt|eweber: y and board 10 was a good 16 opposite 8 here|pg||
nt|peachy: NS in the other room preempted themselves from 4H, it can happen|pg||
pc|c2|pc|d5|nt|collins64: !2 on dummy singleton 3@d for declarer and Mike played 4@d and discard 5@d|pg||
nt|collins64: 2@d|pg||
nt|boyklas: belgium plays 3NT at the OR|pg||
nt|boyklas: in board 11|pg||

nt|boyklas: no by west, its one down at least|pg||
nt|Gerben42: Rudakov getting out for -1|pg||

nt|psridhar: Fredin may get his 800 'back' !|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: we can see in trick 1 how East encorouge with 2@S |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: many players still  have not change to a small card to say your parner we want that suit again |pg||
nt|psridhar: defense shd try to avoid the trump endplay|pg||

pc|c3|nt|star6ija: @h to the queen and home|pg||
nt|xenya: in the other room EW got to an inferior 4@S contract, which, however, had ther advantage of being makeable|pg||
nt|haans: here Fredin does not have a clue what E have|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|tomi2:  wladow will need to set up an extra @D trick now|pg||
nt|haans: South needed @CT and @C lead to bid more|pg||
nt|h_karluk: true, world soccer championship also exciting for many nations|pg||
nt|shevek: duck again|pg||
nt|MolvaM: now take @hA and push another @s|pg||
mc|12|nt|lmeili: !J |pg||
nt|ady: now home    a likely swing for Israel|pg||
nt|ftpe: yes, a little lucky|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|barnets: so to go wrong south must have KJxx in trumps|pg||
nt|othered1: That could be one of the most interesting (if you find ghoulies interesting) hands of the event.|pg||
nt|barnets: and with this holding north would start @HA anyway|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|jillan:  2@C shows 22+ points OR distributional values|pg||
nt|barnets: a spec says KJ9 may be enough so just possible|pg||
nt|mcphee: it would be sad to see those trump on dummy, if so is always hooking E for Q, I think odds highly favor dble|pg||
nt|jillan:  he needed a 4th haerat or at least KJx|pg||
nt|jillan:  heart|pg||
nt|mcphee: KJ9 on dummy would be sad|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|barnets: ok bob thats 2-1 for the guys|pg||
mb|3H|nt|othered1: Looks like south hasn't upgraded his hand.  9 control points and a 5-card suit might lead others to do that.|pg||
nt|jillan:  3NT here?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|jillan:  which makes because E has Qx in @C?|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mcphee: no Jill, because is one of the boys:)|pg||
nt|jillan:  yeas indedd both minor doubleton Q's|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|jillan:  I hink it is, becasue of the minor queens|pg||

nt|eweber: no blood|pg||
nt|vasmar: 4@hearts by E-W will be probably the contract here|pg||
nt|ady: part score hand   Israel likely to play either 1NT   or 2 diamonds|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Easy money|pg||
nt|santyclz: Pearson is rolling...|pg||
nt|hawe45:  2 passed boards out of 12|pg||
nt|xenya: brb|pg||
nt|ftpe: another boring board, 3 nt ew|pg||
nt|psridhar: Fallenius needed to retain that dia for 1100|pg||
nt|h_karluk: neat decision for EW|pg||
nt|chick: it's so annoying to have a hand like N's and not get to play the contract :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|haans: Is soccer and English term and not American?|pg||
nt|andersk: amercan|pg||
nt|andreasw:  4@c wins|pg||
nt|MolvaM: the slam brought 13 to iceland|pg||
nt|MolvaM: open room stopped in 3nt|pg||
nt|shevek: Wales didn't bid the slam|pg||
mb|1C|nt|Gerben42: 5 imps for NL I predict|pg||
nt|haans: ty|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: last hand with the diamonds well hand South might have ducked the first spade  and if spades continued  north night have played the 10 on the 2nd round as a suit preference signal|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 2s shows?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: a normal weak 2?|pg||
nt|andreasw:  in my book it would be to strong for a weak bid|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, the boards in this set haven't been overly exciting so far|pg||
nt|ftpe: 2 diamond multi i guess, hard with only 5-carder and minimum|pg||
mb|1D|nt|santyclz: On the other hand, that was an awfully quacky hand, even with 15 "Pearson Points" (hcp + number of @ss.)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: a knowledgeable spec tells me: maybe invitational (or almost) with spades|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: other room playing in hand nº 12 just 2@S  (no reopening call ther by South ) |pg||
nt|psridhar: 800 just may not be a disaster if only the Israelis stumble into 4s making|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: so swing coming for sweden|pg||
mb|p|nt|vasmar: 2 diamonds and one heart for a routine 620|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, I just played through their defence on 10 (using the MOVIE feature).|pg||
mb|2N|nt|andersk: 3-1 to Slovakia|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2:  I like this 1nt bid|pg||
nt|motu: me too|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 3-1|pg||
nt|MolvaM: semi invitational? |pg||
nt|h_karluk: another DD slam there|pg||
nt|lesh: 1@c 16+ , 1@d 0-7, 2nt is 22-23|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|paulhac:  Possible swing here as 4@S should make but not guaranteed|pg||
nt|roswolf: good point david|pg||
nt|MolvaM: or barely invitational  :)|pg||
nt|shevek: looks like some weakish non-fit bid|pg||
nt|xenya: 3rd seat... -- still a bit too aggressive to my taste|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 5@D -1 |pg||
nt|psridhar: gr8 contract -the Herbsts hit back !|pg||
nt|haans: 5@D was a bit to much|pg||
nt|psridhar: sry is 5d down 1?|pg||
nt|psridhar: yes 2 aces and a spd for d1|pg||
nt|haans: 2 aces and a spade|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: there we are 18/12 for Sweden a string come back after they went down 2/11 |pg||
nt|haans: only reason i can find is try to get board 12 back|pg||
nt|lesh: 23-24 sry :)|pg||
mb|3H|nt|Gerben42: this looks at least -1|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulhac:  Now its all over|pg||
nt|tomi2:  he will be rewarded with friendly breaks all around except of hearts - the best knws he can get. but Smirnov made 4@H so there will ne no huge swing|pg||
nt|haans: different versions of walsh transfer in sweden we bid only 1nt with S hand|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: still a lot to say by both teams |pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@S shows a @H raise and @S shortness |pg||
mb|3S|nt|pitiful:  6@C is a playable spot here|pg||
nt|ftpe: i fully agree|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Unusual with an ace|pg||
nt|othered1:   An unusual treatment.|pg||
nt|lesh: 3@c pupet, 3@H no 4M, 3@s trf to 3nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: E had a difficult lead decision|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Why doesÂ´nt East bid 2 @H in the first round|pg||
nt|haans: NORTH hand|pg||
nt|othered1: both with A and with stiff in partner's suit.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|andersk: Italy is out of the world cup|pg||
nt|yuval10: good morning|pg||
nt|vasmar: good morning Yuval|pg||
nt|star6ija: I think they managed to play in same directions aiming to be shown on the Vugraph :)|pg||
nt|haans: 1@S to show 2 3 spade no extra|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2@C was forcing to game, so I suppose a 2@S continuation covers all the spade raises.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@H over 2@H would be a @H raise and @D shortness|pg||
nt|othered1: and with no side shortness?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Let me ask giammi|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: now at least 2|pg||
mb|p|nt|eweber: while this one would only promise a swing if the open NS pair weren't playing strong NT, but they are|pg||
nt|ady: now 6 easy tricks    I am sure a 7th will come|pg||
nt|shevek: I'm told 2@s is 8-10 , 6@s|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: nice K@C helping card showing to secuence & giving parner a relax moment to tell him your lead made no damagge to defence|pg||
mb|p|nt|pitiful:  safe play by declarer|pg||
nt|mamos: making safe|pg||
nt|pitiful:  leaving trump in dummy to ruff @s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2NT= asking for min/max and distribution. Denies @S raise, may have @H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So they go through 2NT with a balanced heart raise|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|boyklas: 5C at boar 12|pg||
nt|rnmalik: would require some play.|pg||
nt|andersk: this contract is not makeable|pg||
nt|pitiful:  i saw symonds play the other night for Surrey|pg||
pc|s6|nt|haans: do not understand low spade|pg||
pc|s2|nt|boyklas: boar|pg||
nt|shevek: I think it also suggests shortage in @h|pg||
nt|chick: can make 6, but I predict only 5 ... will set up @Ds, they will knock out the other @S stopper, and he won't dare take the @H finesse|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|collins64: Mike 14 HCP opening is not going to run good here|pg||
nt|eweber: wow, another 11 for NL|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Spade lead looked normal|pg||
nt|athene: lauria-versace got some way towards 4@H - just not all the way|pg||
nt|pitiful:  you mentioned flash boys|pg||
nt|lesh: with doubleton Q@d and Q@c and @H finess working he can even make 12 tricks|pg||
pc|dK|nt|peachy: 3Nt was better since hearts 4-4, but one never knows|pg||
nt|chick: hmm, now he may have to take the @H finesse|pg||
nt|lesh: however,what is more important is to make your contract|pg||
pc|dA|nt|rnmalik: cannot rule out an error by the defense.|pg||
nt|eweber: 26:4 now|pg||
nt|MolvaM: the iceland pairs doing extremely well in the event|pg||
pc|d7|nt|MolvaM: one pair ranked 1st in butler with 1,66 imp/board|pg||
nt|MolvaM: other 2 pairs also high with 0,84 and 0,3 plus|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 1,66 imp average over 100 boards is phenomenal|pg||
nt|xenya: well at least it served as a lead director|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|Gerben42: thanks to the 3@S opener|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|boyklas: Dehaye didnt find the S lead so again some imps for greece|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 8 tricks|pg||
pc|s8|nt|h_karluk: yesterday i was in Florence SC, USA sectional, a young lady offered me for an interview to their local TV channel. Her question was "what's the best thing in this game". I think ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 'try to improve your judgement skills' was a fair answer.|pg||
pc|s4|nt|Gerben42: 3NT is a claimer|pg||
nt|roswolf: israel made 4@S ON 9 BUT had some opp bidding to help them|pg||
nt|shevek: iceland lost their 1st match to italy (14-16)|pg||
nt|shevek: after that won 10 in a row|pg||
nt|andreasw:  must have been a good match|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|Gerben42: looks they finally start scoring|pg||
nt|eweber: right, over 2@s life is so much easier!|pg||
nt|peachy: yes indeed it did, having stuff in all other suits|pg||
nt|othered1: ty|pg||
nt|othered1: lost of possible variations here, including a cross-ruff with thos good trump spots|pg||
pc|d4|nt|rigas_karo: discrding the diamond costs a trick, -1 now|pg||
nt|lmeili: E ll be squeezed|pg||
nt|andersk: 3-2|pg||
pc|d3|nt|lmeili: not now|pg||
nt|andersk: OMG|pg||
nt|xenya: only 10 tricks now -- in the other room, i think, a spade was led|pg||
pc|dT|nt|mcarroll: 3-=2!!!|pg||
nt|andersk: stil 1,5 minutes left|pg||
nt|andersk: 2,5 minutes left|pg||
nt|ady: now 7|pg||
nt|shevek: this one looks like yet another one :)|pg||
nt|othered1: Declarer is looking for best way to 10 tricks, not for an overtrick|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|Gerben42: if they win 22-8 they have 39, which is not great but getting back in|pg||
nt|ady: tried for 9|pg||
nt|MolvaM: for me a good match is when I win it|pg||
nt|brolucius: If this sort of deal appears in a problem book (where you are meant to see if you can deal with bad breaks in hearts and/or clubs), I usually turn the page to see the answer ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: straight away. I suppose - somewhere in the  universe - there is a hard-working bridge player who spends ages trying to work out the answers to such problems.|pg||
pc|sT|nt|andersk: this will be 1 or 2 down|pg||
pc|h8|pc|s9|nt|collins64: Mike is very lucky here !!  not a very good defence |pg||
nt|athene: hard with 8-card fit and two balanced hands i suppose|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|s7|nt|Gerben42: of course Russia will have something against that|pg||
nt|haans: ERROR|pg||
nt|haans: ACE|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|andersk: 3 down now|pg||
nt|haans: ERROR|pg||
nt|othered1: North is one of those players who seems to get the answers without turning the page,  however.|pg||
nt|brolucius: He has worked hard at the game in the past, you can be sure.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Lauria probably turns the page and says: this answer is wrong.|pg||

nt|pitiful:  5@c a nice spot here|pg||
mb|d|nt|shevek: Unfortunately losing 2@h - 1@d - 1@c|pg||
nt|lesh: 4@h and 4@s are making,just need to be reached|pg||
mb|3C|nt|roswolf: could be passed out?|pg||
nt|roswolf: no east protects|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes is down|pg||
nt|MolvaM: well dont be sure|pg||
nt|xenya: aha!|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: lets go for the next board |pg||
mb|4C|nt|vugraphzng: the CR send me -2 will check|pg||
nt|andersk: ok|pg||
nt|brolucius: E/W play the weak 1NT, as we saw a deal or two ago, so they open 1@D here.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: at least the auction heated up some :)|pg||
nt|eweber: no double?|pg||
nt|tomi2:  1@S might have longer clubs than spades, I hope he alerted this :)|pg||
nt|andersk: stoppage time now|pg||
nt|haans: Cullin have it|pg||
nt|ady: very thin balance|pg||
nt|athene: now we have to find the club lead|pg||
nt|pitiful:  Roland is probably glued to the cricket at this moment|pg||
nt|MolvaM: elimination possibilities|pg||
nt|haans: 5@D looked like beginner bridge|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: all nicely placed & good distribution , makes 6@H |pg||
mb|4H|nt|collins64: 5@c just made for Greece|pg||
nt|santyclz: Protecting the @hAQ.  Didn't see that coming.|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt not a bad shot - even when a minor-suit lead is right for the defence it's going to be hard for east to find it|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: West trying to disturb bidding |pg||
nt|h_karluk: x and cue|pg||
mb|p|nt|vasmar: small diamond lead :)|pg||
nt|pitiful:  2@s will play ok|pg||
nt|MolvaM: academic now|pg||
nt|xenya: back to life|pg||
mb|p|nt|ziff:  No insider jokes please :)|pg||
nt|tomi2:  maybe there will be an appeal and in september they will decide...|pg||
nt|haans: 5@D a make 2|pg||
nt|andersk: OMG ITALY MISSED FROM 5 meters 5 min over stopppage time|pg||
nt|haans: 6@D a make if @H lead|pg||
nt|yuval10: small @s would've been great|pg||
nt|yuval10: then they force declarer|pg||
nt|haans: more likely that E have the Q rather than A = weaker hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzng: NO DOUBLE APPARENTLY|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: sorry for upcqse|pg||
nt|Gerben42: Rudakov didnt know what 5@D showed in defense and Khven didn't count on @DA I guess|pg||
nt|paulhac:  An OK slam|pg||
nt|lmeili: how to show longer @d than @s?|pg||
nt|mamos: was 2@h single or two suited ?  the latter I think|pg||
nt|shevek: phantom got in the way|pg||
nt|MolvaM: tahts the problems with phantoms|pg||
nt|shevek: won't cost much though|pg||
nt|MolvaM: they should stick to hanging out in the operas|pg||
pc|cA|nt|shevek: will get away with -50|pg||
nt|shevek: instead of +50|pg||
pc|c3|nt|vugraphzng: seems to be clqi;end for -2, correction will come later if needed|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Diamonds 3-3 or doubleton J|pg||
nt|andersk: I have to go for a few|pg||
nt|tomi2:  he upgraded his hand to 18 with those aces and kings|pg||
pc|c5|nt|vasmar: now small diamond works also|pg||
nt|vasmar: if S misguesses|pg||
nt|ady: low diamond lead will beat this|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|eweber: non vul doubling for -1 is a bad bargain when the contract may be made, none of them knows about the opther one's quick tricks|pg||
nt|ady: thlow spade lead also good enough|pg||
nt|mamos: just Hearts I'm told|pg||
nt|andreasw:  they were not in 4@s|pg||
nt|shevek: phantoms , yes :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Ivan was good enough to find it, grats|pg||
pc|h6|nt|peachy: nicely judged|pg||
nt|peachy: as it is, 12 tricks|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Unless he takes a diamond finesse|pg||
nt|peachy: if they duck club, it will be testy|pg||
nt|brolucius: If yo use 12-14 and 15-17 as your ranges for 1NT and the 1NT rebid, a jump rebid of 2NT shows 18-19. They must do something different since West has only 17 here.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Hardly worth an upgrade, with those intermediates, it would seem.|pg||
nt|tomi2:  @S2 gives you the count of the spades, they should behave 4-4|pg||
nt|othered1: Giving an extra Work point or two when  you have only aces and kings is reasaonable, perhaps mandatory|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ady: heart contract for 9 tricks best  |pg||
nt|haans: he had been thinking|pg||
nt|mcarroll: They dont listen to you Hans :)|pg||
nt|haans: see that|pg||
nt|haans: why not clubs to 9|pg||
nt|star6ija: 3rd hand plays high?|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|rigas_karo: well, at least this is NV :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: might be a few twists and turns though|pg||
nt|star6ija: no entries for dummy|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 4@H+2 =480 |pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|andersk: ty|pg||
nt|Gerben42: @H ruff is -2 |pg||
nt|yuval10: she indeed misguessed|pg||
nt|athene: small club after the @DA gives declarer a nasty moment but the odds must be to rise king|pg||
nt|athene: west would indeed lead low from @CQJxx, knowing the suit has to run, but it's more likely he simply has the ace|pg||
nt|aldek: non-vulnerable could be very weak|pg||
nt|mamos: not a great bid then imho   it made any exploration of the hands here impossible|pg||
nt|shevek: Thomas would've bid 4@s if it came around|pg||
nt|andreasw:  and then u could bid 5@c with the risk of being dbl but still u never now|pg||
nt|shevek: true, they bid it to make|pg||
pc|d4|nt|shevek: flat board|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Give the hand to K&R and ask what it's worth|pg||
pc|dK|nt|haans: @H to Q and they forget to take two @D|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 3@D we can take it as a trial bid |pg||
pc|d2|nt|haans: they did forget|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|peachy: good lead, gives nothing away|pg||
nt|lesh: thanks everyone, I have to go|pg||
pc|h7|nt|pitiful:  well if that is your style and it works well for you you tend to stick to it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Kaplan & Rubens Hand Evaluator|pg||
nt|tomi2:  we will need some undo here|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h2|pg||
nt|ady: no way to make unless north discards 2 clubs when hearts are run|pg||
nt|chick: thanks Jivko@H@H|pg||
pc|h8|nt|vasmar: plenty of tricks now for N-S nut not enough ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 18.3 on the K&R so an upgrade was fine|pg||
pc|c7|nt|rigas_karo: @d now for -3|pg||
nt|yuval10: big board for Germany|pg||
nt|ady: south likely to discard 2 diamonds and a club|pg||
nt|roswolf: well i think this can make by force but timing needs to be exacrt|pg||
pc|hT|nt|brolucius: Declarer went against Restricted Choice in the heart suit.|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|paulhac:  He may be able to work out the distribution in which case he may well go off|pg||
nt|peachy: cashing spades to get information on shapes and discards, not sure if it will help him|pg||
nt|santyclz: I'm sure I could convince myself to go wrong there.|pg||
nt|athene: now Mari gets squeezed in the minors|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: sweden made another 5 Imp,s move on board 13|pg||
nt|h_karluk: c u Jivko|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|tomi2:  couldnt he first duck out a club?|pg||
nt|brolucius: 10-x or J-x with South was more likely than J-10-x.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, as a matter of principle they don't read books by Englishmen. They beat them in football instead|pg||
nt|tomi2:  :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: A matter of Principle.|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ziff:  Don t listen, Phoebe, it is about an appeal in Germany in another sequence where a possible canape was not alerted|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mcarroll: Has to keep @D3 as 2nd @D entry to dummy|pg||

nt|pitiful:  some might pass warts and all|pg||

nt|jameslee 2: & they are playing 3NT N-S|pg||
mb|2S|nt|haans: 1@H correct?|pg||
nt|yuval10: board 12: 13 imps for Austria, when Germany played 6@c and misguessed the trumps|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: 1@C was strong, and 3@H creates big problems|pg||
nt|peachy: 1S showed either diamonds, or balanced|pg||
nt|pitiful:  the comeback has started on board 13|pg||
nt|mamos: sorry I have to leave   thanks all  England 5 imps   the fight back begins|pg||
nt|pitiful:  unlucky 13 for the dutch?|pg||
mb|3H|nt|Gerben42: 4@H and still no suits have been shown|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like another routine game for EW?|pg||
nt|tomi2:  other table will make this becasue NS lead 2/4/6 and a 6 card suit not bid is unlikely|pg||
mb|p!|nt|rnmalik: For minors-non vul against vul.|pg||
nt|haans: bidding are correct operator say|pg||
nt|pitiful:  this is going to be ugly but could be at most tables|pg||
nt|dburn: what is Gold doing?|pg||
nt|aldek: this will be bloody|pg||
nt|dburn: bidding 4@h in case partner didn't hear him bid 3@h?|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe this is a misprint - it's hard to believe that East really bid like this; perhaps 4@h was really 4@d|pg||
nt|pitiful:  initially David was not enjoying the auction, now it is Tom's turn to join in|pg||
nt|othered1: If you're going to take a line like west's, why not just play @S back at NS right away?|pg||
nt|tomi2:  2/3 of German top pairs play negative free bids|pg||
mb|3S|nt|rigas_karo: i think he could go 2 down actually if he cashed one round of trumps after north overuffed with the A@h|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Negative free bids, like 2@C here, are popular in some places|pg||
nt|chick: 4 of either major should make|pg||
mb|p|nt|vasmar: Spade lead and continuation may set it i think|pg||
nt|andreasw:  not if @h AJx sit's by west and @s K on east:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|collins64: it looks like it was a quick pass from North|pg||
nt|ady: anyone know what 1@H is    not alert?|pg||

nt|ziff:  No double, no trouble|pg||
nt|pitiful:  how many down?|pg||
pc|c5|nt|eweber: and probably no chance to find the 2nd fit|pg||
nt|motu: hard to dbl for N|pg||
nt|MolvaM: now a non heart lead could bring overtrivk|pg||
nt|andreasw:  will bring a overtrcik but a @h lead look's fair|pg||
nt|andreasw:  then again east could have dbl 1@h|pg||
nt|andreasw:  for the lead|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: a part score 3@C |pg||
pc|cA|nt|MolvaM: would that just ask for a lead or show a real suit?|pg||

nt|brolucius: Lauria, Versace use non-forcing responses in a new suit over a take-out double.|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|yuval10: over @s lead, S needs to signal what she has|pg||
nt|yuval10: for me it's 7@s indicating @d|pg||
nt|ady: 4 tricks or 8 on heart finesse |pg||
nt|dburn: well, he has six tricks|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 9 tricks |pg||
nt|haans: know that @H wrong|pg||
pc|h6|nt|peachy: Not sure what subesequent bidding showed. |pg||
nt|hawe45:  South throws trick away|pg||
nt|athene: NS lead attitude against notrumps - definitely favoured amongst the top italian players|pg||
nt|dburn: so I guess that's four down|pg||
nt|pitiful:  i was thinking 3|pg||
pc|hK|nt|vasmar: true|pg||
nt|yuval10: will help P not to play @c here|pg||

pc|hA|nt|vasmar: she must continue spades now|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|dburn: yes, but you're not defending|pg||

nt|dburn: oh, sure - no one ever believes how bad the contract actually is|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|pc|hQ|nt|Gerben42: 13 tops now |pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|dburn: for example, Brink may not believe he can give Drijver a spade ruff, because that would mean East's bidding is completely berserk|pg||
nt|pitiful:  surely not Ace|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ziff:  The contract could be cold, or he might give away the position|pg||
nt|vasmar: now it makes easily|pg||

nt|tomi2:  I am a fan of nfb, but not sure everybody agrees :)|pg||

nt|andreasw:  yes and should be reach easy|pg||
nt|xenya: bordering on a slam though, as the cards lie|pg||

nt|tomi2:  4@C asking for keycards, all aere ther|pg||
nt|ziff:  Let s hope for 7 then (only the Germans, of course, Bulgarians are allowed to hope for 5) ;)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  2 @C might be the solution|pg||
pc|sA|nt|paulg:  4@d an unusual bid with 4-4 minors, but unlucky to suffer this fate compared to 4@c|pg||
nt|paulhac:  This looks expensive for the Spanish|pg||
pc|s7|nt|tomi2:  so havong AQ of dia himself and QJ of hearts he virtualy sees no loser ;)|pg||
nt|motu: 5@C ask for kings|pg||
nt|yuval10: @h lead likely, then many tricks for declarer|pg||
nt|vasmar: only spade lead can embarass declarer but not seriously|pg||
nt|pitiful:  i am told 1 unfortunate south played in 6@s doubled on the previous board|pg||
nt|dburn: did he make it?|pg||
nt|pitiful:  and one east 6@d redoubled !|pg||
nt|pitiful:  well you might have made it David|pg||

nt|shevek: wonder why not 1NT|pg||
nt|andreasw:  what about @h?|pg||
pc|s6|nt|vugraphzng: There are information that on board 9, it was not put in the right direction in the other room, expect modification|pg||

nt|motu: 5@D= @DK|pg||
nt|lmeili: so he has no @h k?|pg||
nt|tomi2:  @H8 lead vs slam would work nicely, if you have "top of nothing" on your card :)|pg||
nt|ady: now may make an overtrick|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: anoter part score hand |pg||
nt|psridhar: Fredin is quite active making 3 bids ( so far) on his aceless minimum|pg||

nt|peachy: a counteroffer|pg||
nt|peachy: sry guys|pg||
nt|santyclz: Not in @ds.  A good sign.|pg||
nt|tomi2:  the field is relatively close and Germany is around 15VP in front of 10th, so it would also be important to score well against the non-qualifiers too|pg||
mb|3N|nt|rnmalik: Interesting hand.|pg||
mb|p|nt|andersk: Not any boards from live page updated from this match, yet. I have a feeling 2 boards are misscoored, for +3 IMP to Croatia|pg||
nt|rnmalik: would require good play to make this contract.|pg||
nt|paulg:  As well as starting much later on Saturday, you'll only have 16 board matches in the Seniors|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  Presumably to allow more time for a decent bottle in the evening|pg||

nt|vasmar: another 2 imos in board 15 for germany|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 1@H = 4 card @S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In the finals the 9 teams from one group will play against the 9 from the other group and an aggregate score is calculated|pg||
nt|tomi2:  Italy and Iceland have quite confortable leads, they can try to relax in matches agains teams, that will be relegated for sure and save some energy and avoid time penalties (don't know if penalties are also carried into 2nd RR)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Six teams will qualify for the Bermuda Bowl - the top six in the second round-robin. At the moment the field is split into two, so around the top 3 in each section may be seen as ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: the top contenders at present. But there is some luck involved in which of your scores are dropped after the first round-robin.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Penalties are carried forward if both teams qualify, not if only one of them|pg||
nt|chick: with the diamond finesse working and a good guess in clubs, he can make 6|pg||

nt|jameslee 2: 4@S= 10 tricks |pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's stated in the bulletins|pg||
pc|s4|nt|santyclz: N might have been contemplating a @h raise there.|pg||
nt|xenya: seems any reasonable line will succeed here|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|rigas_karo: ruff a @c, @s and claim... next board|pg||
nt|eweber: many diamonds with NE here|pg||
pc|sK|nt|Gerben42: this will somehow make I gues|pg||
nt|Gerben42: even though only 8 tricks are clear, all those 10 will trouble EW|pg||
pc|s8|nt|vasmar: but now she has to find diamonds|pg||
nt|andreasw:  im hopefully not:)|pg||
nt|ftpe: sotuh knows that north has 0 points|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am told that Netherlands qill qualify for BB as hosts. So there may be 6 more Euro qualifiers, making 7 in all.|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|d2|nt|andersk: that was well playes|pg||
nt|andersk: played|pg||
nt|eweber: Drijver no longer has to worry about a @d through his 10|pg||
pc|d4|nt|Gerben42: but has to take care of communication to make his 9th trick|pg||
nt|Gerben42: might get stranded with @HA|pg||
nt|eweber: playing @h first might help, but both J and K are wrongsided|pg||
nt|ady: trying to steal 7the trick|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|andersk: fortunate @C split|pg||
nt|rnmalik: safety for 4-1 break.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: duck and -1|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|xenya: declarer misguessed hearts of course but he can't misguess diamonds|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d9|nt|rigas_karo: actuallt q@s and @d, declarer has to guess what to do for the overtrick, but both lines work|pg||
nt|yuval10: she know S is short.... but she can have a singel J or Q as well|pg||
pc|d3|nt|xenya: so 3 diamonds, 3 spades, 2 hearts and a club |pg||
nt|brolucius: I usually invent a few new words each session. 'qill' will be useful next time I play Thelma at Scrabble.|pg||
pc|dK|pg||

nt|othered1: probably play transfer responses, with double 4+@S|pg||

pc|c3|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|barnets: even if dec tries fro a club disc|pg||

nt|jameslee 2: 4@H= 10 tricks |pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|rigas_karo: with a @h lead, the paly will be very fast...|pg||
nt|motu: i guess he can find the @D position|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @D-shift from North looks needed|pg||
nt|athene: the defence have to lead diamonds at some point|pg||
nt|athene: before declarer gets the clubs going and throws two diamonds on spade and the last club|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Good pass by Magnusson|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A Zia double. "Try to double every time you have the queen in their suit; they will then play your partner for it"|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2:  official scoresheet says 3nt-1 and the play looks like|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Oh, I am asked to tell what the USA1 team is. I will, of course|pg||
mb|p|nt|eweber: a festival for the weak NT players who find their @s fit :)|pg||
nt|athene: not at all easy for north to lead from Qxx round to Jxx though|pg||
nt|haans: He asked and got NO|pg||
nt|pitiful:  this is a nice spot for e-w|pg||
nt|ftpe: 3 nt was hard bid|pg||
nt|xenya: normal to bid 3N on 25 points, but the game is very thin|pg||
nt|ftpe: punish will come, even if lucky lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Fleisher-Kamil, Weinstein-Levin, Stansby-Martel|pg||
nt|tomi2:  I am not a fan of redoubles with hands that have only one thing to say... "I have support and some values". Redouble for me should mean "I want to double the opps" but it is so unlikely for W that he will get opps...|pg||
nt|brolucius: If you play negative bids over a double, you need to use redouble more - I guess.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Funnily enough this is all about @HQ, is it now?|pg||
nt|othered1: I prefer redouble denies fit, unless game force.|pg||
nt|tomi2:  more often opps will preempt you in spades and partner will not know about your fit when its his turn to bid. You should have a bid in your system to show a constructive or invitational raise directly|pg||
nt|tomi2:  best again is to use transfers :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: transfers are useful in many sequences but no-one ever seems to write a magazine article about them. (Must prefer to keep the advantages to themselves...)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Gromöller is a hot favourite to go down. He must lose two spades and one diamond, and why would he play South for @HQ after the take-out double?|pg||
mb|p|pc|cK|nt|rnmalik: and thought well:)|pg||
nt|tomi2:  my gues is: his intention was "pd pls bid 3nt with a spade stopper"|pg||
nt|athene: it could easily give tricks away|pg||
nt|athene: i assume that @D4 is the @H4|pg||
nt|hawe45:  East found the shift|pg||
nt|andreasw:  if denmark wins now free beer for all|pg||
pc|cA|nt|xenya: N was sort of endplayed on the lead -- any suit he might lead (except @Cs) gives away a trick|pg||
nt|psridhar: are they saving vul vs nv on a 4-4? looks 500 to me|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|paulg:  12 tricks looks a lot at the other table|pg||
nt|haans: play clubs at sonest|pg||
nt|haans: soonest|pg||
nt|vasmar: i think that in hearts there are a lot of tricks for N-S|pg||
nt|pitiful:  should make 10 on the layout|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|santyclz: @c back looks safer than @d.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Still tempting though|pg||
nt|shevek: coffee hand is when you need to go to the bathroom and pretend you go to the kitchen :)|pg||
nt|chick: in any case, EW found a makeable game|pg||
nt|chick: won't be easy with the awful trump split, but he has a lot of resources outside of trump|pg||
pc|c5|nt|haans: true always is|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: good 4@S if -1 =200 for a 420 opps |pg||
pc|cT|nt|paulhac:  Looks like 12 on this lead also|pg||
nt|vasmar: now 1NT will go 1 off probably|pg||
nt|vasmar: 4 hearts + 3 Aces|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: but seems a 500 againtx a 420|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mcarroll: not enough dummy entries to trap @HK so will lose 2@D,1@S and the @HK|pg||
nt|haans: sweden DOWN|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3@D should be gf and if so west could have bid 3@S when a slam would be reached|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|athene: declarer really played a diamond, not a trump, at trick 2?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Doesn't seems likely.|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|rnmalik: Cant play @S that would squeeze the hand.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|eweber: ... or play 1@c|pg||
nt|lmeili: wd!|pg||
nt|MolvaM: coffee hands are the type of hands that allow you to go and get a cup of coffee from the kitchen without worrying about what extremely clever remark you can do here as commentator|pg||
nt|tomi2:  he knows now @DQ in north, so not many points left for south. maybe some bad clue, but better than no clue ;)|pg||
nt|othered1: north might have ruffed to play @S through, at possible cost of trump trick|pg||
nt|tomi2:  I am told that the systematic meaning of xx is "10+, often no @H fit", hmm|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Club exit won't help declarer|pg||
nt|brolucius: Clever line of play.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: North rates to have more hearts than South after the double, so it would be against the odds to finesse through South|pg||
nt|brolucius: More important to have your hand in the bulletin than to actually win the match.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Versace could easily have had @CQ instead of @HQ|pg||
nt|tomi2:  spades should be 4-4|pg||
nt|othered1: Whne I play @DK from dummy, south's lead was from J10xx|pg||
nt|tomi2:  dias are 2north and 3 south|pg||
pc|h3|pc|c2|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 1@C is forcing for me :)|pg||
nt|eweber: for those who don't know, Gerben preferably plays Fantunes|pg||
nt|tomi2:  so if clubs are 4-4, north has longer hearts, if 5-3 south has longer hearts|pg||
pc|s6|nt|haans: and he should have|pg||
nt|andreasw:  for me it's smooking hand:)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  smoking|pg||
nt|ftpe: 1 nt opening showing 15-17, having 8 as prd, pass is rigth i think, max. is 25 and 8 had no extra|pg||
pc|s3|nt|tomi2:  and having 4 spades is enough for an Italian player to double, can't remember an Italian TO double on 4144 :)|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sT|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|roswolf: i think west was a bit lazy here|pg||
pc|d3|nt|eweber: good duck from East here|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, i think E overbid -- possibly for tactical reasons though|pg||
pc|d6|nt|tomi2:  interesting positions, I got 10 msg now with THE best line|pg||
nt|tomi2:  @HQ is a nice falsecard|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Brilliant|pg||
nt|tomi2:  makes GromÃ¶ller believe Lauria has the 3rd heart|pg||
nt|tomi2:  so @D pitches will not work|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|ady: will make 12 tricks in spades as they lay|pg||
pc|d7|nt|Walddk2: Gromöller will think Lauria has the last trump|pg||
pc|d9|nt|tomi2:  but would have Lauria played the @H9 from 984?|pg||
nt|brolucius: South knows that declarer has a void club, otherwise he would have led towards the @CK.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Would Versace have played a heart from Qxx?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He did|pg||
pc|dA|pc|h4|pg||
nt|ftpe: what tactical reason?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|paulg:  when dummy goes down your first thought would be about making the contract, not two overtricks|pg||
pc|h9|nt|paulhac:  True|pg||
pc|c7|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|roswolf: lots of swings in this match|pg||

nt|Walddk2: He could have endplayed Versace with a diamond, but he was deceived by the @HQ return|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is a great hand!|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer could have made by playing a good diamond, for a spade discard if South did not ruff. But he placed the last trump with North. |pg||
pc|sA|nt|mcarroll: and Down again!|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|s4|pc|c8|pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|eweber: in the Open they just bid 1@d 3@s 5@d all pass in board 14|pg||
nt|haans: normal in sweden lead your next highest card|pg||
mc|10|nt|chick: nicely done|pg||

nt|barnets: I saw 2 clubs in the dummy there need an eye test|pg||
nt|jillan:  the black suits I mean|pg||
mb|1H|nt|jillan:  look at the protocol..... very black...|pg||
mb|1N|mb|2C|mb|2S|nt|jillan:  can heNS make 5@C? can EW make 4@S|pg||
nt|barnets: yes |pg||
nt|jillan:  ys to both :) :) :)|pg||
nt|othered1: right|pg||
nt|barnets: they make 6@C except on trump lead|pg||
nt|othered1: @DK and trump shift also works, I think|pg||
nt|barnets: no they dont trumps are 3-0|pg||
nt|jillan:  how? will he eat one @S?|pg||
nt|barnets: so if he ruffs twice east has a trump trick|pg||
nt|barnets: so 5 is the limit|pg||
nt|jillan:  Ã think, as I said, there are 2 ways of making 6C... 1. Eat a @S,,  2. put one @S in with the clubs and try and get away withit|pg||
mb|3S|nt|barnets: thats a good analysis jill just like the hog in victor mollo|pg||
mb|4S|nt|mcphee: not clear to let them play 5@C is it?|pg||
nt|othered1: Is this the third or 4th hand on which Raptor 1N overcall has appeared?|pg||
nt|jillan:  one of my best analysis|pg||
nt|barnets: better than my original|pg||
nt|barnets: one|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mcphee: i guess it was clear to them:(|pg||
nt|jillan:  so both sides reached their right contract.....|pg||
nt|barnets: yes well done|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|pc|d6|pc|d3|pg||
pc|c5|nt|barnets: so we have had quite a close match|pg||
pc|cA|pc|d7|pc|c2|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s3|nt|jillan:  high scoring though AND it is not over yet....|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||
nt|jillan:  5 imps per board|pg||
mc|11|nt|barnets: for some reason norway X 5@C on this hand|pg||

nt|hawe45:  Good bidding system to find 6 @D|pg||
nt|athene: yes, very hard|pg||
nt|santyclz: This is the penultimate bd of the session.  Thanks to the EBU, for providing this for us.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Penultimate - does that mean, that they doÂ´nt play it...?|pg||
nt|athene: the auction in the other room is about how you would expect|pg||
nt|athene: east shows a monster balanced|pg||
nt|athene: west staymans for 4-4 heart fit and then just bids 3nt|pg||
nt|santyclz: Thanks to our operator, Jean-Jacques Thiry, great job!|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: Apparently they replay the board 9, wait for this one soon|pg||
nt|hawe45:  7 @D is not so bad, @C King dropping or @S-hook|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - or a black suit-lead...|pg||
nt|athene: you don't want to play 7@D on a hand like this where it's really likely they will not even bid 6@D in the other room|pg||
nt|shevek: sry andreas but they are 47imps behind with 2 boards to go|pg||
nt|MolvaM: u must have a note on yr cigarette package|pg||
nt|xenya: anyway once E has bid something, they were destined to end up in 3N|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 2 for sweden |pg||
mb|1H|nt|rnmalik: @C/@H Aces were correctly placed.|pg||
nt|vasmar: 4@S here depend on heart play after a club lead|pg||
nt|ftpe: east should pass i think|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 25/22|pg||
nt|tomi2:  great deal, yes|pg||
mb|2D|nt|Gerben42: after only 3@S it is very pushy to go to 5@S|pg||
nt|vasmar: sorry they always make|pg||
nt|roswolf: 1nt may be tried|pg||
nt|andreasw:  so no beer,s:(|pg||
nt|MolvaM: smoking makes you miscount the trumps|pg||
nt|shevek: he did say he doesn't want to get old :)|pg||
nt|ftpe: 8 poor points|pg||
mb|3C|nt|xenya: yes, good idea|pg||
nt|iyer7550: we could be seeing a lot of bidding on this hadn|pg||
mb|d|nt|rnmalik: 3NT a big hand in N.|pg||
nt|Gerben42: looks like sure 300 vs uncertain 400|pg||
nt|hawe45:  That logic can not be right at both tables|pg||
nt|athene: 2@D = spades or 24+ notrump|pg||
nt|santyclz: Thanks to my fellow commentators:  William Frisby (England), Hans Werge (Denmark) and those who joined us for parts of the session.|pg||
nt|shevek: aggressive bidding by NS|pg||
nt|ftpe: page 2 in beginners book|pg||
nt|ftpe: 26 for game :)|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mcarroll: If they bid 4, defence always take their 4 minor suit tricks|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 2 boards left|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: maybe :)|pg||
nt|haans: xx standard here|pg||
nt|pitiful:  e-w can make 3@s assuming south does not try to cash @c ace|pg||
nt|pitiful:  2@s|pg||
nt|xenya: but maybe he felt that EW in the other room would bid games at the slightest excuse |pg||
mb|5C|nt|roswolf: i would have competed in hearts on the south hand via lebensohl|pg||
mb|d|nt|paulg:  nasty lead|pg||
nt|paulhac:  This could go a lot down|pg||
nt|paulg:  could easily play South for a 6-4 hand, and leading his second suit|pg||
nt|tomek: cz, jak widzisz|pg||
nt|vasmar: the overtrick on a ruffing finesse in hearts |pg||
nt|pitiful:  double showing a good raise is increasingly popular here|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: this might be some artificial sequence|pg||
nt|chick: 3N seems like a good spot, I'm surprised that N didn't trust his partner |pg||
mb|p|nt|andreasw:  should make here unless N-S will find the @c switch|pg||
nt|shevek: they're busy playing @ss though|pg||
mb|p|pc|dK|nt|vasmar: now the contract is not safe anymore...|pg||
nt|santyclz: Thanks to BBO and Roland Wald for providing this service to bridge lovers worldwide.|pg||
nt|santyclz: And finally thanks to you, the kibs, who drive the whole process.|pg||
nt|tomi2:  Germany gained 5 imps on that non forcing freebid deal and two others in 16|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|nt|santyclz: Vg in your timezone: http://online.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php  Make it your home page!|pg||
nt|santyclz: There are currently only 14 tables on vg. http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/   lets you watch as many vugraph rooms as you want - one window per table|pg||
nt|santyclz: (Of course a 60" monitor would help.)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Looks like one too many|pg||
nt|haans: 23.45 central time next session|pg||
nt|haans: 13.45 |pg||
nt|xenya: so he didn't want to create swings|pg||
nt|haans: 10 tricks with @D 3-3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Spec suggests that Versace should have been in the Italian football team. He can play|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|ady: west wants to clear trumps and then run diamonds|pg||
nt|ftpe: and he didnt :)|pg||
nt|xenya: right :)|pg||
nt|tomi2:  he is too young for this!|pg||
pc|c5|nt|shevek: declarer might sneak 2 @s tricks and 2@h|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2NT= 6+@C-4@D|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2NT shows the diamonds without going past 3@C if that should be partner's preference.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|paulg:  good lead, although a spade would have had the same effect|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Unless defence set up a @C for declarer, they should come to 2@Hs and 2@Cs|pg||
nt|ftpe: after this lead down i think|pg||
pc|d7|nt|eweber: 1NT was nf, so much is known|pg||
nt|vasmar: i don't know if N-S play a 2x1 system and if 3@s would be stronger than 4|pg||
nt|shevek: here....|pg||
nt|psridhar: with 3 kings and a 5 card suit that N hand is a limit raise with 3 trumps to me|pg||
nt|haans: NEWS: rona: madala opened 1@s and his p bid 3@ds//they ended up in 4 spades making|pg||
nt|iyer7550: on a spade lead 3nt will be in big trouble. |pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 5@D made so 9 to Neth.|pg||
nt|shevek: done|pg||
pc|sT|nt|athene: well done|pg||
nt|psridhar: such games are bid freq these days|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: news : on the oter room playing 4@S with a @H leaad|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ady: israel got 7 on board 14 in the thin 3NT    Ireland played a part score in hearts|pg||
nt|andreasw:  so 10 trick's|pg||
nt|xenya: but this is going to be a huge swing to Estonia|pg||
pc|sA|nt|tomi2:  don't know where N found a raise to 6 here|pg||
nt|vasmar: probably she thougth that 4@s was a conservative approach|pg||
nt|shevek: can play @hQ now and claim|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|rnmalik: when in hand @CQ and !K@C to force W to play Ace @C|pg||
nt|vasmar: unmakeable|pg||
nt|vasmar: only Kx in hearts onside|pg||
nt|drkvas: v well done|pg||

pc|h2|nt|rigas_karo: small @c now can could could problems|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: *could create some problems|pg||
nt|star6ija: now we have position for endplay|pg||
pc|h8|nt|star6ija: if S refuse to play @hs|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
mc|12|nt|ady: good defence by north|pg||
nt|andreasw:  danish team playing same contract with same spade but at trick 3 a club switch same|pg||
nt|iyer7550: noo the suit is blocked. if the spade ace is knocked out there is no chance. |pg||
nt|chick: I play @CA, then !Q and overtake|pg||
nt|iyer7550: ok u r right. |pg||
nt|chick: 10 tricks with 8 clubs and 2 aces|pg||
nt|iyer7550: yes 3nt was a safe spot but would not have been doubled. |pg||

nt|roswolf: and to my fellow commentators the 2 Davids|pg||
nt|santyclz: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/10Ostend/Information.htm is the tourny web-site.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Unusual to say the least?|pg||

mb|p!|nt|vasmar: this is tha last board|pg||

mb|p|nt|eweber: did I say a few?|pg||

mb|p|nt|reisig: A great comeback by Germany!|pg||

nt|pitiful:  save|pg||
nt|mamos: 4@S now|pg||
nt|pitiful:  a great board to finish the match|pg||
nt|mamos: even at this vul?|pg||
nt|pitiful:  if e-w do get pushed to 7@h will he make it|pg||
nt|pitiful:  9 back to England on 17 |pg||
nt|pitiful:  south wisely did not overcall |pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes|pg||
nt|haans: yes many are not happy if you do not bid a game that need two finesses|pg||
nt|tomi2:  www.bbotv.com is the link for watching several tables at once, now Sementa is in 4@H but Smirnov lead @CA (after Piekarek found two unforced bid with his ace- and kingless hand)|pg||
nt|chick: yes, 11 tricks is possible, but on a spade lead, I would just cash my 10 tricks and go home :)|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|santyclz: 2@d or a @c splinter?|pg||
nt|cumino: bilanciatone senza cuori|pg||
nt|rialc2: secondo te non ha tentato il fit a @H?|pg||
nt|pitiful:  and e-w did well to bid and make 5@c|pg||
mb|1H|nt|rnmalik: 4@S or 3NT, both the contracts make for NS.|pg||
nt|xenya: spade was led in the OR i'm told|pg||
nt|xenya: W was declarer there|pg||
nt|ftpe: diffcult to lead ace di|pg||
nt|xenya: the @S lead by N looks normal enough, so i withdraw my criticism|pg||
nt|ftpe: withdraw accepted :)|pg||
nt|xenya: and it looks like another disaster for the Russian team is coming|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: are you going to raise to "a lot"?|pg||
nt|paulg:  a kib suggests at least taking the ace of diamonds to cash five clubs first and then play a diamond ... which saves a trick|pg||
nt|haans: the delay after W bid is because SE are on other side of screen|pg||
nt|ftpe: more imps for estonia here, dont think he can manage|pg||
nt|tomi2:  Piekarek ruffed the 3rd @D with no thought to play a skade, now Sementa will get the @H right I think|pg||
mb|1S|nt|rigas_karo: last hand, good luck to both teams for rest of the tournament|pg||
nt|eweber: looking back all the big imps were won by style, board 8, 9, 14|pg||
nt|paulhac:  True|pg||
nt|tomi2:  now he committes himself to 4 level if pd has no @H fit?|pg||
nt|vasmar: for now Austria gets the lead after the unlucky slam of german|pg||
nt|psridhar: abt 25 % game i reckon ( dia 4-2 wih spd 2-2 also ok)|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: 2nd opinion: Rado: 2@H weak 5+@H4+m 3@C pass or correct|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: Last hand Sweden - Israel hope Spect enjoyed , Thx to Vugragher ; coments by hanns , psridhar &    hope to see you  later on |pg||
nt|psridhar: THX ALL THX JAIME|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: next match 13.00   & 16.15   thx to Spectators te most important in BBO |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: good match by both teams as expected very close result |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 13.00 / 16.15 paris time ty Hans |pg||
nt|psridhar: that 3S bid is really stretching too far...N thinking of 4s now|pg||
mb|p|nt|motu: wladow does not know bids like 2NT in such situations|pg||
nt|vasmar: but board 19 will give back the lead to Germany i beleive|pg||
nt|MolvaM: last hand of the match here now|pg||
mb|p|nt|pitiful:  doubled was the stripe tailed ape|pg||
nt|mamos: wow  was that striped ape do you think|pg||
pc|d5|nt|lmeili: never argue with DR Waldow :)|pg||
nt|reisig: disaster coming|pg||
nt|haans: dont ask|pg||
nt|vasmar: S is happy to pass|pg||
nt|roswolf: east will pass?he is normally very reluctant to pass an invitation|pg||
nt|mcarroll: on 19 4@S was made in Open, to account for most of the lead held by Bulgaria|pg||
nt|pitiful:  or at least he will claim that later|pg||
pc|d9|nt|cumino: sry|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: @s @h @d @c last hand  Bye from Ostend @c @d @h @s|pg||
nt|iyer7550: looks like norway will score a moral victory|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mamos: lol|pg||
nt|MolvaM: many thanks to all our commentators and our specs for their valuable guidance|pg||
nt|haans: 3@S must have been premptive|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|andersk: calm finish, so the results as it stands now, is 15-15 in VP|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Its Stayman Jim, but not as we know it?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ady: might be 1 too high    depends on view in trumps|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: very much so 0-6  4 card is the maximum preempitve |pg||
nt|psridhar: but that 3s worked in pushing Freding into the startosphere 4D|pg||
pc|dK|nt|tomi2:  trump lead|pg||
pc|dT|nt|xenya: N doubled on slender values but 4-4-4-1, and S was happy to pass|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|eweber: if I weren't an aggressive bidder I would consider to convert after watching this match :)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  i would like to back to board 4 and 11 tricks was made!!!!!:)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: thanks andreas, nicoleta|pg||
nt|chick: This is the last board for this table,  3 yet to score|pg||
pc|c3|nt|pitiful:  great hand to finish with|pg||
nt|pitiful:  well done to the dutch, they played very well|pg||
nt|pitiful:  after a slow start they are motoring |pg||
nt|mamos: the idea is you double 5 Level to stop them bidding Six then if they redouble you vanish to your save like a stripe tailed ape vanishing up a tree|pg||
nt|aldek: anyhow, great entertainment|pg||
nt|pitiful:  thanks to all watching|pg||
nt|pitiful:  bye now|pg||
nt|mamos: yes thsanks all|pg||
nt|aldek: till next time|pg||
nt|nyg8:  5HX was striptail monkey - i.e. stop then from gettnig to 6|pg||
nt|psridhar: bd 19 Sweden did reach their 'game'|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: both match are no time penalty 3 minutes left |pg||
nt|haans: bye all see you :)|pg||
pc|c6|nt|athene: thanks all...|pg||
nt|maribelxx: another reason for the day being quiet is midsummer... all shops are closed, no public transport, people flee from cities to spend a few days in the country|pg||
nt|chick: Thanks to our excellent vugraph operator,  Michel Machiels, for a great job!!  :)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|rnmalik: good bridge, 20 boards and such little difference.|pg||
nt|paulhac:  North might well have bid over 2@H|pg||
nt|ady: good guess|pg||
nt|maribelxx: sorry :(|pg||
nt|santyclz: Thanks all, see you soon.|pg||
