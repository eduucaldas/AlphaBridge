pc|s9|nt|xenya: this auction and the final contract look quite logical (except the double perhaps)|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|eamongall: I think best for EW was to play 3@Cs ..|pg||
mb|2H!|mb|p|nt|eamongall: those 2@DX and 2@CX often have enough to escape |pg||
nt|sharkey: showing 4@H and longer minor?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|sT|nt|jbgood: you should have a very good reason to pass a take-out double, not sure E in the CR had that|pg||
nt|sharkey: More IMPs to Narvik...|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sA|pc|s7|pg||
nt|eamongall: in Ireland its called anti ...in USA suction ... (although I don't know rest of system)|pg||

pc|cK|pc|cJ|pc|c2|pc|c6|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|eamongall: and you are still wrong side of declarer|pg||
nt|eamongall: multi landy I am told .... thats a fine defence to NT |pg||
nt|sharkey: Kibs confirm 2@H shows 4@H and longer minor...|pg||
nt|jbgood: I passed 2@c doubled five 5 good trumps after my prd had neg doubled in a European Chship once - was an uptrick:(, |pg||
nt|jbgood: sry - I thought you referred to the bidding in the CR Carl|pg||
nt|eamongall: I know folk who reuse their multi stuff as defence to NT ...also folk who play 2@Cs for majors only ....but very few in Ireland are sophisticated enough for both at same time |pg||
nt|sharkey: sry - no|pg||
nt|jbgood: this 3@h is the modern way of playing multilandy - a 4 card major and a longer minor|pg||
nt|jbgood: 2@h|pg||
nt|eamongall: JB ... I can beat that ... I held @HKQ8754 and them trumps and a bidding partner ..and a lady by the name of Irene Robinson cruises into 4@Hs ...well what should I do |pg||
nt|sharkey: Narvik have come out smoking this half and really put the pressure on Topbridge.  Although they're ahead at halftime they may sense the tide's turning here...|pg||
nt|jbgood: you should ask her out for dinner:)|pg||
nt|eamongall: the lady made it ... (no uptrick) and the Deep finesse indicates 10 tricks available |pg||
nt|eamongall: oh yeah I doubled |pg||
nt|sharkey: if she was good looking your defence may have suffered....|pg||
nt|sharkey: Reistand's in the tank....|pg||
