nt|granguru: in 1961 the number of players of a team was ilimited|pg||
nt|beto: Any of these champiosnhips were held in Chile John?|pg||
nt|granguru: 1951*|pg||

nt|othered1: Another flat AKA opposite an opening bid.  In last set those hands got to 1N|pg||
nt|granguru: 1951. Santiago, Chile. Players were Alfonso Agûero Antonio Carrasco Carlos Doren Jorge Guzman Antonio Herrera Jorge oVALLE Jorge Suarez and Julio Subercaseaux (founder of the main ...|pg||
nt|granguru: bridge Club in chile:Club Snatiago)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|othered1: Admitted, here north has implied some length in pointed suits|pg||
nt|duschek: But then, perhaps not that attractive holding six to the ace-deuce and two doubleton queens on the side|pg||
mb|p|pc|s3|pc|s7|pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|granguru: The tie was in Montevideo and Punta del Este in 1964|pg||
nt|othered1: west has to win second @C and shift to @H.  Not all that clear on auction|pg||
pc|dK|nt|fabsayc: wrong sided this contract, defense should be easy|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d3|nt|granguru: If my memory does not fail me they were Roberto Asriel Jorge Guzman esteban Casian Roberto Kaufman and Eric Simons|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|s6|nt|beto: need to duck clubs twice, but then defence has to manage to swith to a @H when west wins the 2nd club|pg||
nt|Walddk2: When was the last time Brazil was not in a final?|pg||
nt|beto: i dont know roland|pg||
nt|granguru: The another winner was Argentina|pg||

nt|othered1: Hi, Kit!|pg||
nt|othered1: some pretty good play so far, including the defense here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: spade finesse for down 1|pg||
nt|duschek: Duck a diamond for a make, say several kibitzers|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not much chance that will work|pg||
nt|duschek: Except West still has a heart, sorry|pg||
nt|fabsayc: requires hearts 5-2 and probably a prior error|pg||
nt|beto: well on a @D duck defence can cash its @H|pg||
nt|duschek: At least I am not just quiet :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But it is indeed a legitimate chance|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It doesn't work here but it might have|pg||
