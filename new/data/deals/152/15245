pc|dT|nt|dimi: true|pg||
nt|Walddk3:  The overall score before this round is USA 85   65 Europe. 100 points wins the cup.|pg||
nt|dimi: Great performance by the USA so long, will be really hard for Europe to come back|pg||

nt|irwinbo: surely a loss for the u.s. on 3|pg||
nt|haans: defensive mistake at other table?|pg||
nt|sybarra: landed on his feet as one would expect of Rodwell |pg||
nt|yvesj49: with big help......|pg||
mb|p|nt|westjava: wlc back:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrh: players are allowed to look at their system cards ....|pg||

mb|1H|nt|rv: this might buy contract here as well|pg||
nt|spooky: 2@H=8-11|pg||
mb|p|nt|spooky: with always 6@H|pg||
nt|irwinbo: minus 800 in the other room  you never know|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Operator, please enter scores on 15 and 16 manually when you get a minute|pg||
nt|sybarra: (just a joke) |pg||
mb|1S|nt|haans: many double here to say somthing about other suit (normally lead lowest suit)|pg||
nt|jcwla: 12 "berry" suit here: A-10, K-9, Q-6, J-5, T-4, 9-2, 8-1.  In second seat red you might want 18.|pg||
mb|2D|nt|spooky: aggresive 3@S bid|pg||
nt|rv: not sure if Levin has enough to bid 3@s in direct seat|pg||
nt|westjava: Europe leads now|pg||
nt|yvesj49: probably 3@s by East|pg||
nt|henryb:  Will North balance?|pg||
nt|henryb:  No|pg||
nt|pef: we're back folks|pg||
mb|2S|nt|Walddk5: http://www.buffettcup.com/Home/tabid/53/language/en-GB/Default.aspx  is the website for the competition. Please visit the site for Daily Bulletins, Running Scores, the convention ...|pg||
nt|Walddk5: cards for the Individual and other information|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Then we need Simon to enter scores manually in MOVIE|pg||
nt|pef: it looks like the last board was a push|pg||
mb|3D|nt|mamos: a helpful start |pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3nt looks the final resting place|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: only think wrong with slam here is lack of aces :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: straight 6 tricks after @S lead. |pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: Borgeland might have converted plus to minus here|pg||
nt|spooky: he probably did|pg||
nt|spooky: 3@H was a preemptive raise, so 3NT bid is strange, probably Levin is wondering what's going on|pg||
nt|rv: only  7 tricks on double dummy defense, in reality I expect Brogeland to make 8 tricks here|pg||
nt|rv: if Weinstein had doubled which he could have, I am sure Levin will lead a minor|pg||
nt|spooky: if Levin leads a @S, and Brogeland plays spade back directly, Levin needs to switch @D|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Good score in OR.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: will be working for the 7th.|pg||
nt|henryb:  may well make seven as cashing spades will squeeze North|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: and lack of fit|pg||
nt|yvesj49: good lead|pg||
nt|yvesj49: declarer has no chance|pg||
nt|jcwla: The surprise lead, eh?|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s4|nt|rv: I expect Levin to get this right and win another point for US here|pg||
pc|sK|nt|spooky: not a point, -1 is still a 0.5|pg||
nt|rv: yes sry even the board|pg||
nt|rv: @c lead would have fetched a point, on @s lead best case scenario for L-W to half the brd|pg||
nt|haans: assume 4@D first 4nt after = do not show @DA|pg||
nt|haans: yes that 2|pg||
nt|yvesj49: 1@d 2@s and 1@c |pg||
nt|sybarra: yeah sure.....|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|haans: did Helness really bid canapé|pg||
nt|westjava: some thing like, after 2@C GF|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3NT not even certain - communication problems- but probable make|pg||
nt|jcwla: Just as Goldie Hawn in "Seems Like Old Times" was "not outside eating chicken, that's for sure," this contract ain't gonna produce 1430, that's for sure.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Seems like the wires got crossed.|pg||
nt|pef: europe is up 2 to 1 in match A and 3 to 2 in match C, so this round may signal a badly needed comeback for the Europeans|pg||
nt|pef: I believe the score here is 1.5  to 1.5 but we'll see|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hK|pc|hA|nt|ady: with spades 3-3   and hearts 3-2  this looks like 12 tricks|pg||
nt|westjava: 10 tricks after @D lead|pg||
nt|haans: playing clubs to KQ|pg||
nt|yvesj49: yes very surprizing lol|pg||
nt|pef: actually 1 to 1 the way it's being scored|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|westjava: 3@C, 3@D, 4@S|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s2|nt|rv: if Brogeland runs the @h suit, Weinstein has enough opportunities to signal @ds|pg||
nt|ady: might now run 8@S  |pg||
nt|jcwla: So on 2, where Duboin went down 4 in 3@H, in the OR it went 2@H around to a double by von Arnim and 2@S by Nunes, making 3 on a 3-3 fit for not enough.  A win to USA there.|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|pef: hampson can make 5 here for the win, but he'll have to guess remarkably well in trumps to do so|pg||
nt|pef: sorry, I mean to make 4 for the tie|pg||
nt|rnmalik: you mean Jill|pg||
nt|pef: and it's jill levin playing the hand|pg||
nt|pef: yeah, time to get my glasses :)|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|nt|rv: srtange|pg||
nt|spooky: oh,,,|pg||
nt|spooky: didn't expect that|pg||
nt|rv: can't be true|pg||
nt|rv: Weinstein has disc @s and played lo-hi in @hs, not sure if all this indicates @d preference to @cs|pg||
nt|rv: this is assuming Levin wins @SA|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Mike Gold|pg||
nt|rv: Hi Mike|pg||
nt|lestergold: Good afternoon all|pg||
nt|lestergold: Hi venky and Roland|pg||
nt|spooky: he played spades 6-5 and @H 7-J, don't think there was suit preference somewhere, not sure tho|pg||
nt|spooky: Hi Mike|pg||
nt|lestergold: and gernbrand |pg||
nt|rv: thinking aloud, would it helped Weinstein to play @Hj and @hx to indicate @d preference|pg||
nt|rv: not sure of their SP methods, many partnerships play smith-echo or rev smith-echo in nt contracts to indicate continuation of suit or shifts in obvious / non-obvious suits|pg||
nt|rv: I am sure Levin-Weinstein have detailed defensive agreements, this deal will test those agreements|pg||
nt|rv: he needs to win @SA though:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: I see i have arrived at the kill point|pg||
nt|spooky: winning @SA is not the problem I think.. i think he is wondering what to switch|pg||
nt|rv: yes Mike, you can give your perspective on carding agreements|pg||
pc|d3|nt|rv: I much like play suggested by Hop, play second @s early|pg||
nt|spooky: wow, it's made now|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dT|pc|d7|nt|odysseus69: going for maximum|pg||
nt|westjava: now 2@C, 3@D, 1@H and 4@S|pg||
nt|odysseus69: spaded best now from South|pg||
nt|odysseus69: better-cash heart|pg||
nt|odysseus69: no score for board 3 from open room - did I see 4Dx -2|pg||
nt|henryb:  Now North is in real trouble|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|haans: ½ a point|pg||
mc|9|nt|pef: well now that won't happen, so a win for europe on the board and they go up by a board with 2 to go|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|nt|kiwi_joker: EW should finish in 4@S here|pg||

mb|p|nt|haans: 4 card M|pg||

nt|henryb:  2@c "inverted; shows about 10+ points in support of clubs, no four+ card major|pg||
nt|rnmalik: yes @H lead and 10 @D to Ace@D, making five.|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mamos: Jason didnt open the South hand  at another table    |pg||
nt|spooky: I wouldn't pass with a 7crd suit in this situation.. would you?|pg||
nt|lestergold: my dog says he would rebid 7 card suit|pg||
nt|rv: I expect another brd for Europe here to tie the match|pg||
nt|rv: I would bid 2@s as well with Levin's hand, his hand not worth much except in @s strain|pg||
nt|rv: really surprised by his pass|pg||
nt|ady: 3@H should make e/w with A@S right|pg||

nt|yvesj49: yes|pg||
nt|yvesj49: or guessing the @s 4|pg||
nt|yvesj49: Queen|pg||
pc|hK|nt|kiwi_joker: Duboin's pass of 3@S influencd by the type of scoring, I guess (BAM). Certainly a hand you'd want to be in game on, in IMPs|pg||
nt|odysseus69: suicide bomber just arrived|pg||
nt|haans: best you can say about that double: Ricking the boat|pg||

nt|ady: good afternoon Hedy|pg||
nt|rv: irrespective of Pairs, Teams or Individual, you won't regular MPs or IMPs, all scoring is on BAM style 2-1-0 per board converted to Buffet Points|pg||
nt|rv: Hi Hedy|pg||
nt|hedyg: Levin could have left Weinstein in hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzrh: its called "Brains" in these parts ...|pg||
nt|yvesj49: ??|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|haans: america closing in|pg||
nt|odysseus69: disrupting the oppo from 1NT is a popular pairs idea but there are limits and this is really stretching the concept|pg||
nt|haans: some say in MP you lose it you let them play 1nt|pg||
nt|haans: thats why DONT|pg||
nt|odysseus69: I was interested to see what Helgemo would lead v 1NT - Helness spoiled it|pg||
nt|westjava: even DONT or CAPP, I didnt bid any thing with E hand|pg||
nt|haans: give the 1100|pg||
nt|westjava: a disaster|pg||
pc|dT|nt|mamos: defence had some chance of keeping this to nine  tricks on Club leads  but ten more likely|pg||
nt|rv: Geoff Boycott's|pg||
nt|sybarra: will need to guess the qx of spades I think to make this |pg||
pc|d5|nt|haans: discard a dim|pg||
nt|chick: from N's point of view, E may not have an entry to the last club|pg||
nt|haans: but does not no if to play @D or not|pg||
pc|dK|nt|haans: right|pg||
nt|haans: @D = jump this suit|pg||
nt|chick: I wonder what the @D3 actually means in their signal system|pg||
nt|haans: you do not kill the diamond suit yourselve if good in diamond|pg||
nt|rnmalik: It has to be a shift and @S looks reasonable.|pg||
nt|chick: that's the question Rashed, does it just ask for a shift, or does it indicate which suit.   |pg||
nt|chick: and if you were sitting S, which suit would you want to signal for?  :)|pg||
nt|haans: Weistein can have max 2 hearts|pg||
nt|rnmalik: imo 3NT makes as the cards are.|pg||
nt|henryb:  this is a "6 or 4" hand|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|haans: Weinstein|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Cant pitch any of the majors please.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|lestergold: lol|pg||
nt|spooky: this board will be a win to europe to tie this match.|pg||
nt|rv: he needs to make all tricks to salvage this brd, even Houdini can't do that|pg||
pc|s9|nt|rv: this form of scoring is toughest to play, even more so than MPs where field evens you a bit|pg||
pc|h8|nt|chick: Keep in mind that this is BAM, which means an extra trick wins the hand.|pg||
nt|chick: This is the most tense form of bridge, because even a tiny mistake can make the difference in a full win or loss of the board point|pg||
nt|jcwla: It just got easier.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I am result oriented:)|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|rv: of Weinstein doesn't know the result in OR and is trying his best to make the best of a inferior contract|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think he must have had the same thoughtas 3 commentators|pg||
nt|rv: most bridge events is not palyed in Barometric style of scoring, hence players don't know result till they play all deals in a session/round/segment|pg||
nt|rv: are not played|pg||
nt|spooky: I played board a match once, and it's really fun, but you have no idea what they do at the other table, because everybody is trying to score the point every board..|pg||
nt|rv: yes Hop, this form of scoring is most definitely bleeding-edge, a bit tougher than even MPs where field does protect you to some extent|pg||
nt|ady: should quicken now|pg||
nt|rnmalik: A@H and another would restrict the declarer to the contract.|pg||
pc|sK|nt|yvesj49: lol simon after work now only diet coke lol|pg||
nt|pef: not making 5 now|pg||
nt|rnmalik: no|pg||
nt|pef: as long as east covers one of the diamonds|pg||
pc|c6|nt|chick: so would just about any other lead, I think.  She has played this beautifully to make the opps help|pg||
nt|henryb:  IMO 3N is easily down after a spade lead|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Take 3@S and a @C.|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|sybarra: K of @D with Rodwell  might get easier,  |pg||
nt|vugraphzrh: dropped QS ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: On 3, the auction of 1NT-swish duplicated in the OR but Nunes failed by 1, so another win for USA.|pg||

nt|rv: every match in Teams and Pairs is worth 4 Buffet points, this round has 3 matches and worth 12 Buffet points|pg||
nt|rv: if BAM score is tied at 6-6, each team gets 2 Buffet points each, else winning team in a match in a round gets 4 BPs|pg||
nt|chick: dummy was irrelevant by then|pg||
nt|haans: agreeing to 800 good bridge :(|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|sybarra: and last bd of this first set in the indy |pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|yvesj49: indy car ?|pg||

mb|2C|mb|p|nt|rv: Bufett and not buffet, it says I am hungry:)|pg||
nt|haans: well done|pg||
nt|westjava: now, an easy bid and play in 4@S|pg||
nt|odysseus69: can declarer find spade queen for the overtrick - thats what this board is|pg||
nt|westjava: yes|pg||
nt|haans: but he wont|pg||
nt|westjava: by dropping:)|pg||
nt|yvesj49: SIMON you can drink a beer in 5 minutes lol|pg||
nt|drewsky: Not strange. Sementa reasoned that if Rodwell, who has already showed up with the king @D, might have repsoned with the Queen of @S as well|pg||
nt|vugraphzrh: these guys are playing really fast ...|pg||
mb|3N|nt|hedyg: no way to find the @H lead that beats this|pg||
nt|drewsky: how can he make it on any lead, Hedy ?|pg||
nt|hedyg: no he cant sry, Nunes wont cover the @d|pg||
nt|rv: @ds are 3-0 else this lead will sell|pg||
nt|haans: 1 down 200 p|pg||
nt|haans: good lead|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 5Cx is a save and they may well try that|pg||
mb|p|nt|spooky: good results for Europe from the open room|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: i assume 1n here ... both minors?|pg||
nt|spooky: I guess natural? |pg||
nt|yvesj49: Q@d strange acrd i meant drew|pg||
nt|sybarra: this table is sprint speed for sure |pg||
nt|yvesj49: card*|pg||
nt|henryb:  Last board at this table. Both other matches are still early and in doubt|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mamos: West's play of the Club combination was something improving players might like to consider --- making three tricks in the suit by leading towards his honours twice|pg||
nt|rv: now declarer rates to go 2 down?|pg||
nt|westjava: yes,a good save|pg||
nt|jcwla: 6-board sets of 25 minutes -- a little slice of heaven.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Seemingly a freeroll for Europe here.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|spooky: it can be both... |pg||
nt|rv: I think Weinstein bid it as natural|pg||
nt|lestergold: natural pasrtner makes takeout doubel i have two other suits bid neither?|pg||
nt|rv: showing 5-7 hcp with @s stopper|pg||
pc|d2|nt|kiwi_joker: diamond pips are interesting|pg||
nt|spooky: he didn't know which 1 to bid?|pg||
nt|haans: rare 4@C with 2 defensive tricks|pg||
nt|odysseus69: now declarer may get spades right- North sounds like a singleton somewhere|pg||
nt|rnmalik: would lose 2 Aces, am I right?|pg||
nt|stigw: 4 H might have beeen a good sacrif.|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|mamos: declarer has some work to do |pg||
nt|sybarra: and watch this one get claimed rather quickly also |pg||
nt|yvesj49: you have extra if you play fast ? lol|pg||
nt|jcwla: Thx Roland, Simon, Shirley, Yves, Rashed, Drew, all kibs.|pg||
nt|sybarra: extra time for the beer :)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|jcwla: Well, there may come a time when E has to take the @SA or lose it.|pg||
pc|d6|nt|rv: well done|pg||
nt|lestergold: well landed in only sane spot|pg||
pc|dK|nt|lestergold: push|pg||
nt|irwinbo: would all of you bd 3nt opposite a modern 3d bid?|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|dT|nt|westjava: 1 point to europe:)|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|rv: 3-3 after 6 brds scored, good close match exciting for specs|pg||
nt|haans: yes 4@C may be a suicide|pg||
pc|h2|nt|drewsky: 100% to bid 3NT|pg||
nt|haans: or not|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|rv: second seat pre-empts are generally sound, but at these colors could be shaded|pg||
nt|rv: if 3@d red in second seat, I would bid 3n|pg||
nt|drewsky: The biggest reason to bid 3NT is that the opponents mught compete in hearts|pg||
nt|rv: at these colors, I will consider a pass|pg||
nt|ady: you lack quick tricks out side diamonds     even if there is sokid diamonds oppsoite   KQJ etc   it seems either a club or heart trick will leave you 1 short|pg||
nt|drewsky: The opponents are cold for 5@C....don't make it easy for them to get there|pg||
nt|ady: club or heart lead |pg||
nt|rv: Fantunes rate to take this atleast 2 down at this stage of play, so Europe may not lose on this board|pg||
nt|ady: thats different if you are bidding to keep them out|pg||
nt|rv: in my experience of watching top level Vu graph, Fantunes are exceptionally good defenders even amongst the elite|pg||
nt|pef: very aggressive 3NT call by levin.  but looks like it will be justified with only 3 hearts available and the spade finesse working|pg||
nt|pef: so looks like this match will end up being a tie|pg||
pc|hA|nt|hedyg: Fantunes play reverse Smith |pg||
nt|yvesj49: ty jordan|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mamos: this was just always going off in the real world |pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: yes, no chance now. Needed to find a double-dummy line of playing trumps (leading high ones from hand to pin East's 9) to keep trump losers to one|pg||
nt|drewsky: Its a 2 way bid...I might make OR they might make.....but I am sick if I let them get to 3@H|pg||
pc|h5|nt|sybarra: I suspect we are back fairly quickly |pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|yvesj49: he could drink a big one lol|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Would lose a @C and a @H.|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h6|nt|rv: in last round, we had match between Zia-Hamman, Meckwell against Fantunes, Von Arnim-Auken decided on last board|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hT|pg||
nt|rv: Drew has a point|pg||
nt|jcwla: On 4 in the OR, B. Levin made the 3@S rebid predicted in here, and Meyers passed, so already a win for Europe.|pg||
nt|yvesj49: 4 is quite agressive|pg||
nt|jcwla: Oh was corrected to down 1 in here, so actually a win for USA.|pg||
nt|yvesj49: with modern light openings|pg||
nt|yvesj49: eric is about squeezing|pg||
pc|h9|nt|jcwla: It's 5 where USA lost the board in the bidding - Rodwell's understandable raise to 3@D over 2@D was not duplicated by Nunes, so Meyers' second double produced 2@S by Levin, then ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: 3@H over Nunes' delayed 3@D.  Meyers did not raise and 3@H the final contract so a win to Europe.|pg||
pc|s4|pc|hQ|pc|h8|pg||
nt|ady: auction was the same in OR except east doubled the 3NT    |pg||
nt|yvesj49: 3 rounds of @s|pg||
mc|9|nt|rv: I expect Fantoni to end-play declarer for 3 down|pg||
nt|hedyg: declarer is squeezed now|pg||
nt|rv: declarer is squeezed and he may concede 2 @h tricks in the end in addition to 4@cs and a @s|pg||
nt|pef: so the match does end up tied.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Thanks all,|pg||
nt|vugraphzrh: next match tomorrow|pg||

mb|p|nt|rv: For those who have just tuned in. Number of boards in the Teams has been cut down from 14 to 12 per session as the players have requested longer breaks. Start times unchanged |pg||

nt|haans: holy ...|pg||
nt|mamos: nine tricks in OR looks a good score|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mamos: defence has  secured a trick in each suit now|pg||
nt|rv: much needed board for US in this match|pg||
pc|h4|nt|hedyg: the singleton J@C did it|pg||
nt|chick: I was in Wales once, and my general impression was "if you don't like the weather, wait 5 minutes, it will change"  :)|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|pg||
nt|mamos: needed to make sure of a Diamond trick  before the Hearts got going|pg||
nt|rv: another push board?|pg||
nt|lestergold: not much to play long dim takes care of spade|pg||
nt|spooky: still needs to find teh @HQ, but don't see a reason to missguess it|pg||
nt|rv: yes, I presume Brogeland will play with the odds and drop @HQ|pg||
nt|rv: only consolation for Fantoni is that he would have lost the board even if he had passed 1n since his counterparts reached 3n 1 down in OR|pg||
nt|rv: he was in lose-lose situation though he didn't know it|pg||
nt|hedyg: right|pg||
nt|rv: can defense take it 3 down for 800, I suspect 500 is the limit|pg||
nt|rv: don't think Fantoni can escape for 200?|pg||
pc|h6|nt|westjava: 6 cards of @H and 6 point, do you bid 2@H, Victor?|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hJ|nt|lestergold: would be eccentric to do otherwise with no information from the bidding|pg||

nt|rv: likely result is 500 for N-S after @SA, @s ruff, 2@ds, @CA and 2 more @hs?|pg||
nt|hedyg: likely slow result you mean?|pg||
nt|rv: :)|pg||
nt|westjava: ty Simon|pg||
pc|s3|nt|rv: this result is good for neutrals, 4-3 in favor of Europe, close match is much more exciting for all kibitzers|pg||
nt|rv: to all folks who are just getting tuned into this event, no of boards in all matches reduced to 12 from 14 on account from all players to have more time for breaks in between ...|pg||
nt|rv: rounds|pg||
nt|rv: starting time for all rounds as published|pg||
nt|rv: I am sure we would like to tell Fantoni that he has lost the board irrespective of what he does from hereon in this deal:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzrh: you may be confused with Ireland ....|pg||
nt|chick: hahahaaa|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s8|pc|sQ|pg||

pc|hA|pc|hT|nt|haans: Weinstein can count|pg||

nt|lestergold: weinstein has given Brogeland chance for overtrick but its a sort of grosvenor|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|rv: since @ds are 3-3, the play of @h suit will determine the destination of BAM point on this deal|pg||
pc|h8|pc|d4|pc|c2|nt|hedyg: he lost the board as soon as Levin passed 1NT anyhow|pg||
pc|d6|pg||

pc|c3|pc|cT|pg||

pc|c7|pc|cQ|pc|c5|nt|pelu: but still 1-0 for Europe|pg||
nt|chick: this is a guess, but with S bidding, she will most likely play him for the A|pg||
pc|c9|pg||

mb|1S|nt|rv: as they say, Grosvenor always works|pg||

nt|odysseus69: my philosophy is over 2 clubs to bid as high as possibe so defintely |pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: well  East though he'd put declarer to the test by leading a smal club  but North had an easy choice and thats definitely a two foot putt missed by the Europeans|pg||

mb|2S|nt|rv: thanks|pg||

mb|p|nt|rv: 2@h shows majors just @hs?|pg||
nt|westjava: ok ty|pg||
nt|mamos: NS seem to have a score which is unbeatable again  |pg||
mb|4H|nt|lestergold: safe to play club so dont really understand the play|pg||
nt|spooky: looks like majors|pg||
nt|rv: looks like both majors (possibly DONT convention)|pg||
nt|rv: Brogeland's double of 2@s should be weak t/o here|pg||
nt|rv: he had passed 1n originally|pg||
nt|daman: should be a push|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: Saelensminde thinking of passing this with all major values/length|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: this one won't make|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: nope|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: dummy was all that weinstein could reasonably expect. But he needed clubs to run for 5 tricks|pg||
nt|mamos: it will be interesting to see if this auction is duplicated at other tables|pg||
nt|mamos: South has no room to manouevre|pg||
nt|rv: anyone for 4n by Levin or Weinstein?|pg||
nt|pelu: same contract in OR - but X there|pg||
nt|chick: The 2@SX-1 on bd 20 was a push|pg||
nt|chick: This cannot make, so X will win the board|pg||
nt|haans: OR North played 2@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: yep|pg||
nt|vugraphzrh: no actual bidding ..|pg||
nt|daman: endplayed on opening lead|pg||
pc|h6|nt|rv: this will get cracked|pg||
nt|lestergold: understandable at these colours even cracked it gains if only 1 off|pg||
nt|rv: Brogeland competing at these colors must have decent values|pg||
pc|h8|nt|lestergold: what??|pg||
nt|spooky: no double surprising|pg||
nt|rv: looks like N-S forgot to double E-W in 5@s in OR|pg||
nt|drewsky: The problem for N-S is that north cannot make a forcing pass, therefore his double shows 'cards' and south must use his judgement. The double is not penalty|pg||
nt|ady: might go down 2|pg||
nt|rv: yes I agree drew, could either of them more likely Weinstein bid 4n?|pg||
nt|haans: part scores gold in BAM |pg||
pc|hJ|nt|lestergold: world champs allowing themselves to be robbed|pg||
nt|rv: can't believe that, distinct lack of trust in partner?|pg||
nt|spooky: this will be a win to USA|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|s8|nt|pelu: Match A US +1, Match C Europe +! and here exp 4-4|pg||
nt|daman: best lead for the D|pg||
nt|daman: and now an early coup|pg||
pc|sT|nt|drewsky: SImple principal: Partner has balanced and pushed the opponents up one level, so why double and punish him ?|pg||
nt|lestergold: encroyable|pg||
nt|pelu: C = +1 for EU|pg||
pc|sK|nt|westjava: this is USA board, 3nt cant -5|pg||
nt|odysseus69: part of the problem with this form of scoring is that if the result is known from the other room the hand becomes irrelevant sometimes|pg||
nt|haans: yep minus for kibs |pg||
nt|westjava: like this hand:)|pg||
nt|haans: TD should be allowed to tell skip this board you win/lose|pg||
nt|odysseus69: however for purists we can still watch for good technique in bidding play and defence|pg||
nt|westjava: from the top players in the world!|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|daman: do we have a running score?|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|pc|sQ|nt|spooky: Drew it's Board a Match, everything is needed to get a win|pg||
nt|rv: in this forming of scoring, pass is really strange, at IMPs I can live with pass|pg||
nt|lestergold: because 50/100 not enuf at point aboard |pg||
nt|lestergold: at imps pass  is fine|pg||
nt|spooky: is it never 300 if you have AK AK in majors? :)|pg||
nt|rv: passing is being too wimpy in my opinion|pg||
nt|drewsky: Well, if they were vulberable, I can see trying for 200 instead of 100, but there is not as much value in trying for 100 over 50.|pg||
nt|lestergold: you cannot pass when your partner has shown some values u have ak ak k and they are at 3 level and knope at these colours they rae bound to be taking the mickey|pg||
nt|rv: more interesting question, could defense have taken 6 tricks here?|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|kiwi_joker: I must run, see you next time|pg||
mc|11|nt|lestergold: no but it may well be 2 off and then you definitely make more than 100 ur way and u must get 300 to compensate|pg||

nt|chick: Since Auken's 1@D was totally artificial, S may expect N to have led from @D109(8)|pg||

nt|rv: this form of scoring (BAM) ensures most of boards are interesting|pg||
nt|rv: much better than IMPs|pg||
nt|spooky: BAM makes boards more exciting, every 10 points are important, so it takes more energy, so you are totally tired at the end of the day|pg||

nt|rv: I expect Europe to hit back on this board, I can't see Bobby Levin making 11 tricks here|pg||
nt|lestergold: trying to guess how 11 tricks were made in open room|pg||

nt|haans: key1809: easy 6d :) ME: rite u r|pg||

nt|haans: grossly outbid|pg||
nt|pelu: 5@D in OR|pg||
nt|scotty: You might have a chance to make if N had, say @cKx.  You could ruff 2 spades AND set up the fifth club|pg||

mb|p|nt|westjava: carbon copy bidding|pg||

nt|haans: Helgemo|pg||

mb|p|nt|odysseus69: no problem now|pg||

pc|cJ|nt|mamos: well done|pg||
pc|cK|nt|rv: re all|pg||
nt|rv: looks like Brogeland has avoided dreaded @d lead|pg||

nt|rv: best defense here is win @hk and back @H?|pg||
nt|rv: even if he ducks this, I can't see declarer coming to 11 tricks|pg||
nt|rv: declarer may score 1 more trick on endplay on West, but he will still be a trick short for 11 tricks|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|h3|nt|rv: his only options were to double 3@c or bid 3@d, he couldn't pass|pg||
nt|drewsky: Agree he cannot pass, but perhaps his first call of 2@D got him into this predicament|pg||
nt|hedyg: quite so Drew|pg||
nt|rv: maybe he was regretting his original bid of 2@d as suggested by Drew|pg||

nt|rv: did he actually throw @HK?|pg||

nt|pelu: 6@D at all 6 tables! wd|pg||
nt|rnmalik: and can make 7. Am I right?|pg||
nt|scotty: Interestingly, you can take the spade finesse either way - the spots allow for a ruffing finesse.  But with West having the stiff @d, you would play her for it|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk5: OK, so USA wins this match. I make it  USA  46    Europe  38     after this set|pg||

nt|daman: can pitch a @C on a @D if not areful|pg||
