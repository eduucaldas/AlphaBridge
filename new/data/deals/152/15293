nt|Walddk4: Welcome back, Tez|pg||
mb|1S|nt|cicus: while we are waiting, a spectator told me Deep Finesse said 5@C could not be made on a hand where Zaleski played 4@H on 6-0|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello all,  i think I am early |pg||
mb|3H|nt|haans: right now :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: 1 strongish NT is certainly possible here, if your system allows it.  Mine doesn't with M 2-2.|pg||
nt|andersk: In Lithuania many probably play polish club, right?|pg||
nt|vugraphzsc: Results can be seen here  http://www.pzbs.pl//wyniki/turnieje/2010/wilno/team/teamleaderb.html|pg||

nt|cicus: hi Shirley, you are not, you can take my playe , have to go soon|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: 6@S makes imo.|pg||
nt|haans: but not 6@H|pg||
nt|rnmalik: No:)|pg||
nt|othered1: looks like a transfer to @S|pg||
nt|vugraphzsc: I think it wasnt|pg||
nt|othered1: There's a case for defending with south hand.  They have bid one of your long suits.|pg||
nt|cicus: *place|pg||
nt|haans: re Shirley|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: would have expected North to do something, even if 1@d could be only three cards|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Rehi!|pg||
nt|rodal f: 4@H would been interesting by a @H lead. Would N duck the first @D? But now they play 3|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Shirly:) Nice to see u again.|pg||
pc|c8|nt|haans: life is not fair|pg||
nt|othered1: Perhaps we should ask what 1@C implied|pg||
nt|haans: to many aces for a clubs lead|pg||
nt|cicus: even if he does not duck NS have a trick in each suit|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cT|nt|rnmalik: EW doing their best to push them to 6.|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  no alert, but W looks angry|pg||
nt|vugraphzsc: Sorry it was alerted|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|ybob: short 1 trick i think|pg||
nt|vugraphzsc: And it was a transfer to spades|pg||
nt|andersk: strange 2 NT, imo|pg||
nt|othered1: Very aggressive, if natural (unless it shows 17-18 or so)|pg||
nt|ybob: upgrade |pg||
nt|dburn: but it probably would not matter all that much what he did|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||

nt|haans: no extra trick|pg||
nt|haans: @CA throwing a spade|pg||
pc|c5|nt|andersk: upgrade when you got a double behind you, still strange|pg||
nt|othered1: 8 tricks and needs help for a chance at 9|pg||
nt|ybob: maybe 1@H shows values too 7+ and E shows 18 hcp bal|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr. Privat|pg||
pc|c9|nt|andersk: I dont count as well as you, Ed!  I can only count 6 tricks|pg||
nt|rodal f: A @S can run at @D or?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|haans: well not easy|pg||
nt|cicus: this will require a lot of work by declarer|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|haans: Hej Frank Rødal|pg||
nt|rodal f: If @CA was used at trick one. For 10. Am I wrong?|pg||
nt|vugraphzsc: declarer ducked first club|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Sveta:) Nice work so fare.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|rnmalik: 2 Aces and a K with N and pass. Otherwise difficult to visulise the hand with S.|pg||
nt|othered1: It's strong, I'm told, which explains the 2@C bid|pg||
nt|jacksond: 1c =11-13 balanced or any 17+|pg||
nt|Walddk4: yes, two-way club|pg||
nt|vugraphzsc: 1 Club is 11-13 bal or 17+|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But strong when he bid 2@C|pg||
pc|sK|nt|april7: hello everybody and good afternoon|pg||
nt|ralfwil: W had no good lead, without helping declarer|pg||
nt|othered1: A natural auction might let you out a level or two lower|pg||
nt|cicus: the lead help|pg||
pc|s9|nt|haans: some say never lead singel with singel trumph|pg||
nt|othered1: north shows his "entry" in @D?|pg||
nt|sybarra: isnt it a bit scary to lead low here?|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 4@h looks like 10 tricks and a save in 5@c looks correct|pg||
nt|othered1: I think it's take it or lose it in @D right now.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: sry 5@d - misclich - a bad keyboard|pg||
nt|ralfwil: look at this  - MISCLICK:)|pg||
nt|othered1: doesn't it look like @D underlead is the only likely way to beat it?|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|pc|hQ|nt|rnmalik: absolutely correct.|pg||
nt|ybob: i think 2NT probably denies 3@S|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|h_karluk: The cards shown wont give South players much joy|pg||

pc|cA|nt|othered1: I was including the eventual @H trick, perhaps prematurely|pg||
nt|Walddk4: McGann-Hanlon have been the anchor pair in Ireland for a long time but missed out on selection for the Europeans this summer|pg||
pc|c3|pc|s2|nt|ybob: S know J@C on N|pg||
pc|s6|pg||

nt|garnetts: true they have given up on me --too many overcalls with flat 11 counts at the two level |pg||
nt|viren169: How high will West go?|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|garnetts: OK I admit it--I would have tried 4@H here |pg||

mc|8|nt|garnetts: a good score for EW or should be |pg||
nt|garnetts: east needed to bid 5@D for the lead as that beats 5@S   --5@C was eccentric |pg||
nt|viren169: I meant 5@S is 1-off...|pg||
nt|viren169: I think 5@S is always -1 with spades 3-1|pg||

nt|april7: weak 2 opener|pg||
nt|haans: re all|pg||
nt|ybob: can declarer have J @C and play A at trick 1 ?|pg||
nt|andersk: yes, If he is afraid a switch, but this time, no!|pg||
nt|othered1: Unlikely, and at matchpoints something on which to act,perhaps.  But it's nice to ensure you beat games at imps|pg||
nt|ybob: with JXXXX and JXX its impossible|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, Tez|pg||
nt|othered1: does east open "any 11?"|pg||
nt|vugraphzsc: Results here  http://www.pzbs.pl//wyniki/turnieje/2010/wilno/team/teamleaderb.html|pg||
nt|haans: 4@H |pg||
mb|3H|nt|april7: and 4@S  probably by N going down on a @D lead|pg||
nt|rodal f: 4@S will come but will EW take the sac?|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: np :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello all |pg||
nt|jacksond: the other 1c  now |pg||
nt|sybarra: but 4 @H could be -1 I think |pg||

nt|sybarra: and rehi Hans :) |pg||
nt|mdgraham: good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|cicus: now I suggest X|pg||
nt|cicus: not easy, of course, 3@H might be the limit of the hand|pg||
pc|d4|nt|april7: even by S after @H leadds and @D switch|pg||
nt|othered1: That vulnerable overcall feels dangerous to me.|pg||
nt|andersk: 1 NT is my kinda style:)|pg||
nt|ybob: i like X but ...|pg||
nt|othered1: it's 14+.  If within my range, certainly.|pg||
nt|rodal f: We all are it seems:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: besides 4 @H always "transfers" to opps 4 @S |pg||
pc|d2|nt|ralfwil: For me an opening on S - yes|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|haans: Hi Mike|pg||
nt|sybarra: hi Mike :)  welcome|pg||
nt|ybob: always with 4/4 M´s|pg||
nt|tez: if 1nt is 15-17 i prefer to open 1nt|pg||
nt|othered1: I'd upgrade if my 1N was 12-14|pg||
nt|othered1: But 3N should be bid using most methods.  NOrth's hand isn't exactly a distributed 10-count, it's an opening by old Culberston standards.|pg||
nt|tez: polish players mostly lead 2-4|pg||
nt|cicus: and if X then 3@H, what does it mean?|pg||
nt|haans: normal|pg||
nt|haans: forcing|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|april7: @D ace and J for @H shift|pg||
nt|h_karluk: owerwhelming defence|pg||
nt|othered1: Nice stop in a makable spot|pg||
nt|cicus: yes, I agree|pg||
nt|rodal f: The interesting thing was if EW made there sac at 4@S|pg||
nt|cicus: even when it is wrong for them|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sybarra: thats better |pg||
nt|sybarra: assuming Q |pg||
nt|othered1: He'll go after @H tricks|pg||
nt|haans: but long way to 5@C so ...|pg||
pc|s6|nt|haans: for beginners 3NT did show spades or he should not have bid Stayman|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|sybarra: oh well |pg||
nt|haans: double finesse in @D|pg||
nt|sybarra: why not take the @C hook? |pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|haans: well can you see a better bid for Kartanas? :)|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s7|nt|cicus: I don't think 5@C can be made|pg||
pc|sA|nt|sybarra: what am I missing |pg||
nt|haans: OT just falling|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe I played too loing with Aunt MInnie |pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|haans: no hearts so ...|pg||
nt|cicus: maybe NS simply do not have a plus score available|pg||
nt|cicus: at a game level|pg||
pc|sK|nt|tez: take this trick and after it there is 2 way.First play @dT or A of @h|pg||
pc|h2|nt|haans: bobholl: was it canape or just inspired ME: good question no answer|pg||
pc|c2|nt|haans: not winning bridge stopping at part score|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I think your Aunt Minnie had the right idea|pg||
nt|sybarra: of course she always played for 2/2,  (when the experts went down)  she cracked me up |pg||
nt|mdgraham: it is a safety play, of sorts, catering for @CK singleton offside|pg||
nt|othered1: Agree. |pg||
pc|sQ|pc|h3|pc|c4|pc|d3|pg||
nt|dburn: less dangerous when East is a passed hand, and West's opening is very likely to be a weak no trump|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|rodal f: Not shure if it's wrong.|pg||
pc|c3|nt|haans: good play|pg||
nt|othered1: Wow, did Versace really not cover?|pg||
pc|c6|nt|tez: it was dangereous and really very interesting|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|haans: can end with endplaying South|pg||
nt|sybarra: Pszczola=Pepsi,  since no one can say his name  (or spell) |pg||
nt|andersk: the downside is to miss a Major fit, the upside is that you show strength, so If pard have enuff to invite or enuff to game, he will staymanbid, and you find the majors|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d6|pc|h4|nt|cicus: hard to stop with 2 12-HCP hands, that's true|pg||

pc|d8|nt|rnmalik: Once I saw Staymen Convention misused against a NT-2@C, with a hand having 5+@C 3@D, 3@H and 2@S. P on 2 @C bid 2@H and 3NT by responder and now the opener bid 4@S and went to bid ...|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 6. The lesson unless you have a major please dont use staymen.|pg||
pc|h7|nt|haans: only good choices|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|othered1: I'm more concerned with having my head handed to me than I"m missing a better partial, even though the latter is quite likely with this shape|pg||
mc|10|nt|cicus: my remark was an answer to the transfer remark by Shirley|pg||
nt|rodal f: Loosers are the EW but NS to take them before EW have @D tricks?|pg||

pc|h3|nt|suketbombi: yes  on a @S lead declerer wud have been scared of East hand but he well placed now|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|othered1: wonder if south could have doubled negatively on second round?|pg||
nt|andersk: I would|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|april7: EW could try for slam, |pg||
pc|h6|nt|ralfwil: I think a @c switch is the best defence|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|andersk: FIFO|pg||
nt|cicus: 1@H and 1@C to lose, spades do  not matter|pg||
pc|d8|nt|othered1: Even with the ominous @S stiff, I'd double, t hen backpedal the rest of the way|pg||
nt|dburn: no doubt he could have done, but perhaps he feared a light opening bid opposite|pg||
nt|andersk: Fast In Fast Out|pg||
nt|ybob: i like a pass from S and W over 2@C|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
pc|c9|nt|andersk: why do you want a ruff with KTx in @D?|pg||
nt|othered1: maybe two ruffs|pg||
nt|ybob: other move was K @D|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|pc|cK|pg||
pc|hT|nt|haans: down to NT play|pg||
nt|dburn: perhaps what he wants to do is force declarer to draw trumps, so that his side can cash more than two club tricks|pg||
pc|h8|nt|andersk: 2 ruffs, when partner passed 2 @C, I doubt it|pg||
pc|h9|nt|sybarra: can E get the ruff?|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|haans: easy play|pg||
nt|suketbombi: may end up lossing 2/3 imps on this bd west by no strech of Imagination had an Vul vs NV over call with that hand|pg||
nt|haans: rite u r :)|pg||
nt|suketbombi: i wonder why he did not to for 800+|pg||
nt|rnmalik: claim time.|pg||
nt|othered1: a low ruff and later trump trick, rather|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d7|pc|d5|nt|april7: if possible to show singleton @C, but W to strong in singleton suit, so invitation rejected|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am told  pszczo³a=bee in english:)|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|dburn: or perhaps he hoped that West's third trump would be a little higher than the four, so that he could promote it with a fourth round of clubs|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d9|pc|dQ|nt|mdgraham: rehi all - connection problem|pg||
nt|mdgraham: would you reopenas Wrest, Shirley?|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes |pg||

pc|c2|nt|suketbombi: 2@Cs @DS 2@S 3@Hs can be easily collected by defence if not more|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk4: After this match there will be a major break for lunch. Restart in 2 hours and 50 minutes|pg||

pc|dT|nt|dburn: still, he got there anyway|pg||

pc|s3|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but is makeable if S can find the @c  distribution|pg||
nt|othered1: Right, but if they get it, south has to guess the position.  Lack of 8 will keep declarer from running 10|pg||
nt|cicus: but then why did he duck the 2nd @H?|pg||

pc|s4|nt|dburn: perhaps it did, but the auction could have been at the three level by the time it came back, and he wasn't really worth 3@h|pg||

mb|p|nt|rnmalik: Sorry a @S and a @D.:)|pg||

nt|ybob: surely 2@C = GF |pg||

nt|dburn: well, not sure whether the methods were at fault or whether North could have bid more slowly|pg||
nt|othered1: Or south's judgment, if north was showing good @H, good @C|pg||

nt|haans: Did Olanski give opps a cluibs?|pg||
nt|rodal f: If som don't know how BAM work.   Same score at bought tables give 0,5point. If a table score 110 and the other play NT and score 120    Then the 129 make 1.0 for there team|pg||

nt|garnetts: 4@S is the best contract here--but very difficult to find |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome back to Dimi Markaris|pg||
nt|viren169: 6@S is on...|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|garnetts: Yes but lucky to make |pg||
nt|viren169: as the cards are|pg||
nt|viren169: they will reach 6@D|pg||
nt|dimi: Hello Roland, Gad and David|pg||
nt|garnetts: 6@D looks like a good contrcat but likely to go off on a club lead|pg||
nt|viren169: Hi Dimitri|pg||
nt|garnetts: Hi Dimitri|pg||
nt|viren169: usually 4-4 fits are better than a 5-3 fit, but not here|pg||
nt|garnetts: Interesting 3@D bid|pg||
mb|5C|mb|d|nt|viren169: yes... but probably bidding shape out|pg||
nt|garnetts: Playing 2/1  this might suggest extra values |pg||
nt|viren169: if 2@H is GF|pg||
mb|p|nt|viren169: some play it as shape showing... |pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|viren169: the @C lead is secured!|pg||
nt|rnmalik: x of @C may keep NS in 5@D.|pg||
nt|garnetts: Matter of agreement--personally I like to keep the bidding low--2@H over 1@S is always a problem because it takes up so much space |pg||
nt|rnmalik: and it has.|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|viren169: Yes I agree...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Terrible contract at matchpoints|pg||
nt|garnetts: 5@D looks like a vile matchpoints contract|pg||

pc|d4|pc|d2|nt|dimi: the good news he can make it|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|pg||

nt|suketbombi: yes |pg||
nt|haans: again np|pg||
nt|rnmalik: a partial, EW might gain at 2@S or 3 max.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: are we sure off one?|pg||
nt|vugraphzsc: Yes we are |pg||
nt|mdgraham: no problem Justas|pg||
nt|dburn: now, if 4@h were a picture bid - I have everything in clubs and diamonds, nothing outside - South could take a shot at Blackwood|pg||
nt|dburn: sorry, clubs and hearts|pg||
nt|ybob: i think 2NT shows @C and over 3@C from S, N can try 3@H and then 4@H ...|pg||
nt|othered1: That was my suggestion above (picture bid), methods I prefer.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: my keyboard again entries...|pg||
nt|cicus: a spec tells me: its everywhere where polish TDs are running tournmnts- like in Vilnius and Pula|pg||
nt|cicus: no new pairs|pg||
mb|1S|nt|haans: rite boring deal|pg||
mb|p|nt|ybob: nice Ed !!|pg||
nt|andersk: I agree with that David, however 2 NT is a much better bid. |pg||
nt|cicus: thx for the info|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I think so, Sveta will change the EW names soon|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3D|nt|ralfwil: Har inte följt med så noga,så du kan ha rätt|pg||
nt|ralfwil: sry private|pg||
nt|tez: while u are playing 7@s u must play Q first for against JTXX|pg||
nt|ralfwil: another slam. 6 or 7@s?|pg||
nt|tez: if west has JTXX u have no chance|pg||
nt|othered1: right and it ends up that the nice @H break compensates for the ugly break in @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: A fine approach.  But one of those 2/1 auctions where you agree in the post mortem, but that's after the patient has expired.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and she is doing that right now|pg||
mb|4D|nt|haans: doubles hanging loose here :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think this auction wrong|pg||
nt|haans: got you :) but chicken out|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: only father and son arrived now, the whole family is here :)|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|sybarra: East is not finding this bidding fun |pg||
nt|othered1: 7@S is good enough to bid, I think, especially since you're confident they'll be in at least small slam in OR|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Lauria  Giubilo|pg||
nt|haans: 4@S better|pg||
nt|rodal f: Wrong major contract to come?|pg||
mb|5C|nt|suketbombi: yes also admire the agression of E_W in other room to be in 6@H:)|pg||
nt|haans: again a Kartanas bidding scoring Gold|pg||
nt|othered1: 2N looks like just a "stall" to let partner bid out his hand, perhaps with @D support.|pg||
mb|p|mb|6D|nt|april7: loks like 4 @S and making by cross ruff, due to distribution|pg||
nt|vugraphzsc: 2 Diamonds was alerted but after the pass |pg||
nt|h_karluk: to me 1d-1s, 2s better but maybe they've a different CC than mine|pg||
nt|othered1: Assuming, of course, that we're not into relays|pg||
nt|ralfwil: to make 7, S has to play in a correct tempo and use his entries well|pg||
nt|cicus: hmm, 4@H was down, can he make 4S?|pg||
nt|haans: new try?|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: NS cannot play 3 rounds of @S, then E might go down|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  2@d was either 12-14 or 18+ with 4 spades|pg||
nt|h_karluk: close to be doomed but not sure|pg||
nt|h_karluk: may just concede three tricks well|pg||
nt|april7: 3@H,3@C by ruff, 3@D by ruff and 1 natural trump trick,or 2 @D ruffs|pg||
nt|h_karluk: a space to pitch @c loser to @h|pg||
nt|mdgraham: same as next door|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: spirited stuff by East here, who seems to like bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: oh, he can't :)|pg||
nt|haans: blood|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sybarra: this should end up a push |pg||
nt|othered1: This south will consider how he makes 7 with 4-0 split and won't go wrong.|pg||
nt|haans: are Parol really asked?|pg||
nt|cicus: it seems to me 4@S was on with some very good guessing|pg||
pc|cA|nt|othered1: But 7 is tricky to bid.  That 5th @S in north hand is invaluable.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: that is to make the correct ruff in @h and keep entries on hand|pg||
nt|ralfwil: unlucky with the @s split compensated with 3-3 in @h|pg||
nt|othered1: anyone translate the auction?  Is it relatively natural?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: looks very natural for me|pg||
nt|tez: maybe 2nt shows @sfit|pg||
nt|tez: if not..bad bid|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sybarra: club now,  might get ruff later by S |pg||
nt|mdgraham: defence can get @HA, trump and a club ruff|pg||
nt|sybarra: but oh well  |pg||
nt|othered1: NS probably were making 3@H on the auction, maybe even 4|pg||
nt|cicus: right slam contract|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|april7: cash all high cards and then cross ruff|pg||
nt|tez: ohh noo|pg||
nt|haans: little unluck|pg||
nt|cicus: however, will probably go down|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|d8|nt|mdgraham: but not now|pg||
nt|cicus: e.g. the @D opening has to be taken immediately to avoid the ruff|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|haans: sad when your ruff with your trumph tricks|pg||
nt|rnmalik: part of the game:)|pg||

nt|rnmalik: next please.|pg||
nt|haans: North may get atrick for @CT|pg||
nt|ralfwil: astonished if not 7@s now|pg||
nt|rodal f: Playable since @S is 3-3 but need the right way handle for the @D color|pg||
pc|d4|nt|april7: @S was not the best idea but defence helps|pg||
nt|cicus: would be normal to cash the high trumps|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ralfwil: but not now|pg||

nt|tez: ny=NT|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|pg||
pc|s7|nt|h_karluk: i say nice opps:)|pg||

nt|Walddk4: you will see the player names|pg||
nt|dburn: perhaps they were, since West would doubtless have led a spade - but even so, South might have lost a trick in the suit anyway|pg||
nt|ybob: wasted values QJ@S, J @H , J @C and J @D here|pg||
nt|othered1: east would have been on lead against @H|pg||
nt|dburn: so he would, sorry|pg||
pc|s3|pg||

pc|s4|pc|sA|pc|s6|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ralfwil: now @sQ is importaht|pg||
pc|sT|nt|othered1: Is it meaningful that north bid @D, his long suit, first and got to 7@S, while in OR @S were bid first and they got to 6?|pg||
nt|cicus: but West's bidding is a textbook example of what not to do|pg||

nt|dburn: even though he would not be on lead against 3@c|pg||
nt|andersk: I noticed the 3 @CX should have been made at the other table, with that deefence that was played|pg||

mc|11|nt|viren169: and some think automatic to open 1@H|pg||
nt|viren169: any views from the panel?|pg||
nt|viren169: I have to admit, I am in the Pass camp.|pg||
nt|dimi: partner will never anticipate 2 Aces with a weak two opener, that might be a disadvantage|pg||
nt|garnetts: OK--1@H is fine with me as two aces make it a poor weak two--too much defence--so 1@H is fine |pg||
nt|viren169: Yes... I agree|pg||
nt|garnetts: As a rule--although if partner has passed exceptions can be made--never pre-empt with two first round controls |pg||
nt|viren169: Good rule...|pg||
nt|garnetts: In my view this includes hands with an ace and a void |pg||
nt|viren169: Why is that David?|pg||
nt|garnetts: Worth noting that top players with 6-4 shapes tend to open three rather than two--Norman Selway opned 3@H with 10xxx  KQJxxx xxx void and robbed the oppo |pg||
nt|garnetts: The reason is that when partner is evaluating whether to try for a slam she will not think you have two first round controls |pg||
nt|rnmalik: http://www.pzbs.pl/wyniki/turnieje/2010/wilno/wilpairs.html  for running scores.|pg||
nt|viren169: I see...|pg||
nt|garnetts: Flawed pre-empts like that can afford to enter having passed first or second in hand --and partner will know you have one |pg||
nt|viren169: I suspect Norman Selway robs a lot of opponents because he is good player!|pg||
nt|garnetts: Well he is--but he also flouted the rule about not having the other major |pg||
nt|viren169: Good rule to have in your kit-bag|pg||
nt|garnetts: My main point is that first and second seat discipline is needed --3rd seat do what you like |pg||
nt|viren169: Yes... tend to see that a lot more nowadays|pg||
nt|garnetts: 4th seat is another matter --needs discussion |pg||
nt|viren169: 5th and 6th seat?|pg||
nt|viren169: What do you suggest in 4th seat?|pg||
nt|garnetts: Interesting might play 2@D as strong and 2@H and 2@S as 12=15 with a six card suit |pg||
