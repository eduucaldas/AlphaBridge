pc|h5|nt|hedyg: http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/  for BBO-TV. Watch all  vugraph rooms at the same time, even while playing or in the lobby. No download needed|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or Fleisher-Kamil|pg||

nt|ahollan1: all other pairs playing big club|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: you're right :)|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||

mc|12|nt|kareno: Why didn't he pitch that last diamond from dummy?|pg||
nt|kareno: I guess he did :)|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 2@H was Kokish  either strong with @H or very big NT hand|pg||

nt|Walddk3: Chuck will get player names up as soon as he gets a minute|pg||
nt|daman: I don't think the Moss squad will be sitting on their hands waiting for breaks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Chuck will enter names when he gets a chance|pg||
nt|ahollan1: west is Sylvie Moss, North Sasha Cohen, East Migry Campanile, South Rozanne Pollack|pg||
nt|mariner1: slam chance here NS|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|mariner1: can make 7 finding Q@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: splinter to 4@C?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: jump shift to 3@D??|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 7@H 7@S or 7@D all can make (all on Q@D hunt)|pg||
mb|2N!|mb|p|mb|3D|nt|ahollan1: real key from Sasha's point of view is the @D suit|pg||
nt|mariner1: Key Card now|pg||
nt|daman: Moss team in 6@S on Board 81 in CR|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@C from Pollack as Exclusion would be great treatment|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Sasha can't ask -- needs to know way too much that KC won't tell her|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: we have Closed Room up now|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|daman: redouble or 5@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: superfluous dbl -- gives NS more room to sort things out|pg||
nt|mariner1: Moss in Closed Room bid the 6@S on board 81|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wow|pg||
mb|p|pc|s4|pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: 5@C already said -- no @C loser -- Pollack worried about a) trump  b) missing grand|pg||
pc|s2|nt|daman: I would have bid 5@D    S must have first round @C control|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dK|pc|dA|nt|mariner1: now S has to sort of guess about N's @S quality|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i like 5@D too george -- but more because Pollack KNOWS Cohen can't cue in red suit|pg||
nt|daman: missed a big chance to put the opps away|pg||
nt|daman: if they bid the grand in the CR     watch out|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 13 tricks not certain -- need good things to happen in a red suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and decent trump split|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and guess which good thing happened :)|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d9|pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: so for the puritans, just a question of whether 6@S arrived at convincingly or not -- which gets an extra 5 points :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: Al no style points?|pg||
nt|daman: my guess is if you were in 7 and had to play it wide open?  you would end up making on a high crossruff after pitching @Ds on the @Hs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is there a sure line for 12 tricks?|pg||
nt|mariner1: well most lines work|pg||
nt|daman: and ruffing @Cs along the way    East cannot get out of her own way on the play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm not sure george -- that seems to rely upon @H 33  surely better to try @D first|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s9|pc|sJ|nt|daman: they are in 7 in the other room|pg||

pc|h9|pc|h4|pc|hA|nt|daman: 7 will make on a dummy reversal with 2 @C ruffs I believe|pg||
nt|ahollan1: send out a call for Michael Rosenberg and Bart Bramley -- what is BEST line for 12???|pg||

nt|hedyg: tststs|pg||
nt|hedyg: does this mean the 3@d would have been nf?|pg||
nt|scotty: no|pg||
nt|kareno: In 2/1 no, it would not.|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: he was temporizing, look for support|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: No, unless specifically agreed|pg||
nt|kareno: 2NT was 100% forcing.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2/1 pairs out there -- make sure you discuss whether your 2M rebid promises 6+ suit -- don't assume and it is not standard|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: I don't play it promises 6, just a min. hand|pg||
nt|kareno: Slam is too much of a reach here.  |pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|hedyg: EW play "5 card majors, semi-forcing NT, Eastern Scientific style"|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Not much works for declarer|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: it barely makes 4NT|pg||
mb|5N|mb|p|nt|scotty: in fact 4N can be defeated, I think|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@h was making with 98 dropping|pg||
nt|kareno: Diamond king makes 3nt just fine.   but 4nt is too high with the spade that will no doubt be led.|pg||
mb|6D|mb|d|nt|scotty: Even 51h, maybe|pg||
nt|scotty: 5@h|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2 hands in a row using 5N Choice of Slam|pg||
nt|kareno: So they have stretched a bit too far here.  West has a pretty hand but east doesn't fill the diamond gaps needed.|pg||
nt|hedyg: welcome back Michael :)|pg||
nt|kareno: Michael :)|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Hi Michael :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we're into the final 30 boards to determine which team will be USA2 in the Sao Paulo Brazil Bermuda Bowl in late august/early sep|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Breaking News. The next World Bridge Series will be held from October 116, 2010, at the Marriott Hotel in Philadelphia. This will be the first time this Championship has been held ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: in the United States for 16 years|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Zia wants the extra IMP or 2|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/Events/wbf/2010philadelphia/default.asp  for more information|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Fleisher team has been playing since day 1 - when round robin began|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Wow, fantastic! Thanks Roland :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: except yesterday|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Nickell team began in USA1 Semi-Final where they were beaten by .... Fleisher|pg||
nt|scotty: West's 4@d bid looks attractive, but he needs 3 key cards to make 6@d - and partner might have tried 3@d with a hand that suitable|pg||
mb|6N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|scotty: So maybe West should content himself with 4N over 3N|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Zia had to double this also I think|pg||
pc|h9|nt|kareno: That's no better! but not doubled.  Hmmm.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Nickell team now playing 4-handed  Freeman went home sick :(|pg||
pc|h2|nt|kareno: Recurrence of heart problems if you know?|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Did they find out what was wrong?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure of ailment|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: they found out|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: what is it?|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: but it's not up to me to broadcast ailments|pg||
nt|kareno: West marked with only one heart.|pg||
nt|hedyg: did Fleisher think double was a Lightner?|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Probably... that would explain 6NT.|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|scotty: West was influenced by their 2M opening style which is very sound - maybe he expected E to open that with this hand|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 8-12 According to their CC|pg||
nt|kareno: Too much outside of hearts!!|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c2|pc|cA|pc|c7|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|pc|dA|nt|hedyg: agree|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|hedyg: that would show a better suit|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: I would open that 1@h without thinking :)|pg||
nt|scotty: The slam West was most likely to miss by going low was 6@h, excellent opposite Axx, KJ10xxx, x, Axx and fair opposite @hKJ9xxx|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: But then I also pre-empt on trash|pg||

nt|scotty: On @d lead in 6@d, you are basically cold if @d, 2-2 OR hearts 4-4 OR @hQ with W and hearts 5-3|pg||

nt|ahollan1: hard to convert to penalties at this vul|pg||
nt|scotty: Really tough hand to play|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: This will be a tough hand for Kamil, since he has extreme entry problems, and has alot of work to do|pg||

nt|scotty: How did Hamman know that?|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: He doesn't, but I don't think it can hurt to win?|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|s7|pc|s2|pc|s4|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Zia does best to duck to maintain communications|pg||
nt|scotty: It would hurt to win first heart if declarer knocked out partners club trick, then later your @d trick - since partner would have no hearts to clear them|pg||
nt|hedyg: why not play @d for an entry to hand?|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pc|h2|nt|barnets: no im in europe for 3 weeks|pg||

mb|p|pc|d6|nt|kareno: You always want to force your opponent to make the last guess.|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|scotty: I don't think West's double would be the popular choice in the MSC - though it would certainly get votes.  I think 2N would be the top choice|pg||
pc|c6|pc|d6|nt|ahollan1: 2N much easier if 3rd @S|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Not really, especially at this vul... Partner could still in theory have QTxxx or something... 2NT is strangely appealing with the West hand|pg||

nt|hedyg: Zia really wanted a @d to play @c|pg||
nt|kareno: That was such a shout for a diamond lead, not a spade, so Zia could get trumps on the table.|pg||
nt|vugraphu4: zia pitched the @d3 somewhat angrily|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yet another @H looks best now|pg||
nt|hedyg: it is frustrating when your partner ignores your cards|pg||

pc|d8|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d2|pc|d4|nt|scotty: Advantage of 2N was that he was 5-4 the "right" way, so if partner with 3-3 bid 3@c (as he usually would) he'd find an 8-card fit|pg||

nt|hedyg: why did he switch?|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hT|pc|hK|pc|h4|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Now K@D and 9@d through|pg||
nt|scotty: Zia switched to a heart hoping his partner had the jack.  He did not want to let declarer elope with small trumps easily.  He has no idea what the spade situation is|pg||
nt|scotty: Or little idea, anyway|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Nickell 26-3 this set|pg||

nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|scotty: Partscore is quite a prediction.  N-S have 24 HCP and a 6-card suit|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Anyone for a 1NT opener from North (specs are interested :))|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: teams can agree to restart early -- do don't rely upon the posted schedule|pg||

pc|sT|pc|s3|nt|mtvesuvius: @s will let this through|pg||
nt|hedyg: would, Adam, would!|pg||
nt|kareno: Why should west not lead his partner's suit?  |pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: would* :)|pg||
nt|scotty: But would anyone even THINK of the @hQ lead if dummy had @hA10x facing Kxx and a spade lead were successful?|pg||
nt|kareno: Generally when you overcall it is because you want your suit led.|pg||
nt|hedyg: W has no excuse to lead anything else|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Right, @s seems to be a normal lead|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: East DBL or 1@S -- they've only been discussing that since takeout doubles invented in late 1920s -- don't hold your breath for a definitive answer until next millenium - and maybe ...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not then|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: East could have doubled 1@d, that would give an option of a @h lead|pg||
pc|c4|nt|kareno: East can't do anything now - heart lead would give up trick nine.|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cJ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|scotty: I think Meckwell prefer to double with the East hand.  I never know what to do.  if you double, you might miss a 5-3 spade fit (and you are not strong enough for further action) If ...|pg||
nt|scotty: you bid 1@s...well, you saw what happened here |pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, but I generally overcall and so do many players - it's a matter of style.|pg||
nt|kareno: I generally overcall, intending to take further action.|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hT|nt|hedyg: for the exciting last segment|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: didn't this make with an overtrick?|pg||

nt|mtvesuvius: ok, thanks all :) |pg||
nt|hedyg: it did|pg||
nt|hedyg: bye for now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: dbl with 4@S & 5@H makes more sense to me than 5@S & 4@H  [because partner MAY bid 1@H with 3@H & 3@S]|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: ok, thx all :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they're starting last board in other room now|pg||
nt|scotty: Also, the "SLOW" N-S auction - 1N, 2N 3N was more suggestive of a spade lead.  Had N jumped to 3N, now you picture the possibility of long @d, and you might attack somewhere else ...|pg||
nt|scotty: (though normally you'd at least like to have a 5-card suit)|pg||
