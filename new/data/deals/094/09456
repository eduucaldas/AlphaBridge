nt|oosmanb: what did i miss 3@H made??|pg||
nt|oosmanb: interesting hand here, was watching this in OR|pg||

nt|westjava: 2@D opening,4414 or 5 cards @C|pg||
nt|vugraphzmx: misunderstanding about opening bid|pg||
nt|rial: 2D, is a Kokish opeing bid, short in @D or @S|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|vugraphzkt: Checkback|pg||
nt|lestergold: no reason to bid a nt slam with a combined 30 points|pg||
nt|henryb: 2@d is fewer than 16 points and a singleton or void in @d with no 5 card major|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzmx: W assuming that 2@D = weak|pg||
nt|henryb: no|pg||
nt|westjava: hi Henry:)|pg||
nt|henryb: Hi|pg||
mb|3C|nt|vugraphzkt: max 2 3 4 4 shape|pg||

nt|vugraphzmx: welcome back|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|werge: So 5 @H now|pg||

pc|s5|nt|ketoprak: claim..?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|oosmanb: wants @S lead?|pg||
nt|oosmanb: or a -90 imps dbl?|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|farrukh: good dbl for 2 imps minimum|pg||
pc|c4|nt|oosmanb: well @S lead is the only double dummy lead on which you can not make|pg||
nt|oosmanb: according to GIB|pg||
nt|lestergold: the double is the sort of bid which normally attracts a redouble and make|pg||
pc|cT|nt|lestergold: luckily for north no one can redouble and few would make either|pg||
nt|werge: @D to the 10 = 12 tricks|pg||
nt|werge: Squeeze they call it|pg||
nt|lestergold: but with north showing spade length why should east play north for dim length too?|pg||
nt|werge: Almost...|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pg||
nt|granguru: N should have played @DA|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s6|nt|werge: @D to the ten is only real hope for two tricks in that suit|pg||
nt|oosmanb: @S and @D is best shot i think|pg||
nt|granguru: the known card|pg||
nt|ketoprak: agree|pg||

nt|ketoprak: hi Kang|pg||
pc|d9|nt|oosmanb: but if north ducks you can not make|pg||
