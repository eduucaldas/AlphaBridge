mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Smart can|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr Lost con but ended up as exspeted|pg||
mb|4S|nt|bjacobs: Smart was really stuck over 2@D I suppose|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think 2NT is textbook stuff|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Bagchi "see red" (the vulnerability) and bids 3NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Doesn't that show 11-12 with a C stopper?|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: if you double 2@H please hide  = no more bidding|pg||

nt|bjacobs: Yes ... tougher if you take a point or two away|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now, let's see|pg||
mb|p|nt|benjent: No danger, but 3NT is a (marginally) better/safer contract than 4@S. And a lot safer than 6@s|pg||
nt|rodal f: Use 11-14 NT openings so this show 15 - 17(18)|pg||

pc|h4|nt|rodal f: Was a spot for 6@S here. Still tough @S are 1-4|pg||
pc|hK|nt|april7: the X was also wrong, because E makes it now and W WAS FORCED  TO CONTINUE BIDDING ANYWAY|pg||
