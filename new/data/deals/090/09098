nt|athene: hi everyone|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@H or 1NT? 1@h for me|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Commentators are Henry Bethe, Peter Gill, William Frisby and Alan Shillitoe|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: ff|pg||
nt|athene: yes, 1nt if in range|pg||
nt|the saint: I'm a 1NT man|pg||
nt|Walddk2: ff = Liz Scott, our operator :)|pg||
nt|jtr: Nope|pg||
nt|henryb: 1@h for me too; two flaws for 1N: light on HCP and worthless doubleton|pg||
nt|vugraphzjh: f|pg||
nt|jtr: Diane|pg||
nt|the saint: I would proably upgrade that one to a 15-17|pg||
nt|petergill: Both these pairs played together in the same event a year ago. |pg||
mb|1H|mb|d|mb|3H|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: 3@H weakish|pg||
mb|p|pc|h8|nt|Walddk2: Correction. Our operator is Diane Greenwood, married to a certain David G|pg||
nt|Walddk2: who is also with us now|pg||
nt|athene: if you open 1nt it might well go all pass|pg||
nt|athene: you don't mind losing your heart fit when it means opps lose their spade fit|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|nt|the saint: And It looks like I will make 1NT if it does|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|athene: club lead, knock out @HA|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c7|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
pc|s5|nt|petergill: 3@h can be beaten. To beat 3@S, you might have to punch dummy's trumps with repeated @h leads|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s3|pg||
nt|athene: good 5-card suit and no bad hcp mean i would happily open 15-17 1nt with north|pg||
pc|c4|nt|athene: people can put it through the K&R evaluator if they like - i am sure it will come out as about 15|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c2|pc|c8|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s6|pc|s4|nt|athene: and the other room conducted the auction we were suggesting|pg||
nt|the saint: I would have thought EW would do better to play on @D. @C seems to risk losing control if things misbehave|pg||

pc|hK|pc|c6|nt|petergill: Yes, and if a diamond is led at Trick 2 to the king, North might have to duck (a very hard play to find) to muck up the entries and beat 3@H|pg||
mc|8|nt|petergill: Ruffing that @H by West was a big error|pg||

nt|daman: here we go|pg||
nt|daman: should be a competitive major suit partscore battle|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ralfwil: For me Wests hand is perfect for a rise on an invitation with the aces.|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: 3@S by W possible|pg||
pc|c4|nt|daman: so much for that|pg||
pc|c7|nt|dburn: maybe he should have bid it, but it's easy to understand why he did not|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
nt|mamos: Not many Wests would pass after 1@H|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|nt|ralfwil: interesting second bid on S. If they are playing a 5-card major opening 2@h shows a 6-card suit or?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 2C would not be universal |pg||
nt|eggy: just one of the "never" (type 3) camp I guess|pg||
nt|mamos: lol|pg||
nt|daman: NS will make 8 tricks at least|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ralfwil: How many of you should bid 1@s on N? |pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|mamos: I have to say I hate 2@C here |pg||
nt|oliverc: 1@S every time for me|pg||
nt|mamos: and me|pg||
nt|daman: Hi David|pg||
nt|mamos: declarer off to a comfortable start|pg||
nt|april7: E could have made a DONT bid|pg||
nt|daman: only if that is part of their system :)|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|nt|ralfwil: that´s my opinion too|pg||
nt|eggy: just standard I think|pg||
nt|mamos: 2@C is just an overbid IMHO|pg||
nt|oliverc: on the other hand, north is a passed hand, so limited|pg||
nt|eggy: and then South would bid 2S I suppose|pg||
nt|dburn: and only if he were a certifiable maniac|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
nt|eggy: ah - or pass|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Not for me if it was 4315 (@c6 is a heart)|pg||
nt|april7: NS play weak NT so DONT not possible|pg||
nt|daman: that too|pg||
pc|h8|nt|odysseus69: or pass 1S|pg||
pc|c3|pc|hQ|pc|h4|pg||
pc|h7|nt|mamos: anyway 2@H is going to survive with perhaps an imp to Ireland|pg||

pc|c8|pc|c6|pc|cJ|nt|eggy: really?|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|c9|nt|dburn: meanwhile, though, North has done pretty well with his 1NT opening - if they choose 1@h at the other table, East-West may well compete in spades|pg||
pc|s7|pc|cQ|pc|cT|pg||
nt|daman: 1NT seems normal though|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ralfwil: kind defence|pg||

nt|athene: east might have a 2@S toy in his bag for this hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: While you all were discussing this, Sharp forgot to lead the good @c to pitch his @h loser and went down|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: Bd 1: anyway, that was a very complex card play hand, in which many good foursomes would play "ping pong", passing ownership of the contract from one side to the other|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: I firmly believe S should ALWAYS bid 2@c over 1N|pg||
nt|athene: this can go down if east switches to a club after the spades|pg||
nt|petergill: Me too. |pg||
pc|s3|nt|athene: the defence can get 5 spades, @CK and @HA|pg||
pc|s6|nt|athene: i am sure west will be able to signal encouragement in clubs on the fourth and fifth spade|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||
pc|s9|nt|petergill: 5/4 1x - 1NT (non forcing) - if the 4 card suit is lower than the 5 card suit, 100% of the time I rebid it. |pg||
nt|the saint: Or pitch lots of low diamonds|pg||
pc|sT|nt|athene: or of course he might signal discouragement in diamonds :)|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s7|pg||
pc|sK|nt|athene: yes, 5-4 is a suit shape|pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: N-S might play Gazzilli, so 2@C is artificial|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|athene: but you should still rebid|pg||
pc|s8|pc|h4|nt|henryb: which is why you should not open 1N with 5-4|pg||
pc|c6|nt|henryb: or at least avoid it|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|s2|pc|h5|nt|athene: a subtle @C6 from west|pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: hmmm couldn't he do something louder?|pg||
nt|athene: like @C7- @C3 if playing standard discards|pg||
nt|henryb: like the 7?|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|athene: or @C3 - @C7 if playing upside down|pg||
pc|d7|nt|jtr: Bear  Put the first names in the profile only please|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d6|nt|athene: bingo|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|petergill: I once read an article by a mathematician who mathematically "proved" that 2524 shapes should not be rebid 2@C after 1@H - 1NT. Which only goers to show that mathematicians are ...|pg||
nt|petergill: usually no good at bridge - the article was rubbish. |pg||

pc|dA|nt|Walddk2: http://bridgewebs.com/cgi-bin/bwg/display.cgi?pid=display_news&club=brunswick  for the tournament website|pg||
pc|c3|pc|d5|nt|athene: i always shout at partners who play the 6 as "High" from something like 8762|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|athene: they have a strange desire not to waste the 8 :)|pg||
nt|petergill: Agreed, West must play @C7 not @C6|pg||
nt|the saint: Trick is coming back though. NS not capitalised|pg||
nt|athene: play the @C7, then a smaller club to show that the first one was big!|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cK|pc|cT|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|h7|pc|dJ|pc|hT|pc|hK|pg||
mc|6|nt|petergill: Or @D2 on the 4th @S, then @C7 on the 5th spade, as partner is sure to be looking at the discard on the 5th spade, but might miss the discard on the 4th spade. |pg||
nt|the saint: South pitched off her long suit|pg||
pg||

mb|p|nt|mamos: 3NT looks a more likely contract|pg||
mb|1H|nt|april7: another partscore @S fpr EW and @H NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: clearly depends on standard for 2D opener in 2nd seat vul|pg||
nt|daman: NS will bis to 2@H and EW will probably balance in @S|pg||
mb|1N|nt|daman: bid*|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|april7: now 2@S by E? perhaps|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: same start next door - then over 2NT south bid  3D - whatever that meant|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: noooooooooooooooooooo|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: well whatever 3@S means it showed a good hand|pg||
nt|daman: wrong hand|pg||
pc|d6|nt|eggy: Presumably it is Blue Club style here|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d8|pc|dA|pg||
nt|ralfwil: probably an endplay on E for 10 tricks|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|pc|hJ|pc|h3|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h8|nt|daman: another profit for NS|pg||

nt|april7: S tries to go down|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c2|pc|cK|nt|dburn: East probably ought to have risked 2@s, but that's the kind of action that comes with experience|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sT|pc|sK|pc|s7|pg||
nt|april7: no|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|h9|pc|c3|nt|dburn: meanwhile, though, South probably ought not to have been playing like this, but...|pg||
mc|8|nt|dburn: ..she survived, I guess|pg||

mb|p|nt|petergill: Well, N's discards made East's @d exit relatively safe. |pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|henryb: another hand to bid 1M-1N-2@c|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|petergill: These two countries are not the favourites to win this U25 international event. |pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|petergill: 2@S now, or 2!1D?|pg||
nt|athene: east's 2@D suggests this is a Gazzilli sequence|pg||
nt|henryb: 2@s for me|pg||
nt|athene: so 2@C = clubs or 17+; 2@D = 7/8+|pg||
nt|the saint: This is not a Gazzilli sequence|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@D or 2@S by E I meant?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: No, it's natural, not Gazzilli|pg||
nt|athene: ok it appears all natural and honest-as-the-day is long|pg||
pc|c7|nt|athene: it would be more normal to rebid 2@S rather than 2@D, with east's hand|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|pc|c4|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@D should be a 6 card suit or a nice-textured (e.g. KQJ10x) suit which is playable oppsite a singleton, tending to deny 2 spades. |pg||
pc|d7|pc|d3|nt|athene: with a suit like @DKJ1098 you might be more inclined to offer diamonds as trumps|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d6|pg||
nt|athene: as they might be worthless if they aren't|pg||
nt|athene: but two quick tricks are just fine for a spade contract|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dJ|pc|h2|pc|d5|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s3|pc|s4|pc|s2|pg||
pc|s7|nt|petergill: 2@D and 2@H are slightly different by East on this sequence - 2@H has to be bid on more 5 card suits in case 4@H game is on in a  5-3 @H fit. |pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|pc|sT|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cA|pc|c8|pc|c5|pg||
nt|henryb: South seems to be in a conspiracy to let East make maximum|pg||
pc|sK|pc|d9|nt|athene: well, perhaps:- but the other side of that coin is that east's 2@H ought perhaps to promise six, so you can get to aggressive 4@H contracts on 6-2 or 6-3 fits|pg||
pc|cT|pc|s8|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@C and 2@D are non- forcing of course - in Standard Bidding, any 1NT bid by anyone (i.e any of the four players) reverses the usual forcing status of new suit bids. |pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|pc|h5|pc|h7|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h8|pc|h4|pc|hT|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d2|pc|s9|pc|c2|pg||
pc|dT|nt|henryb: One can sacrifice 2@d contracts and play that 2@d shows 5@h and 2@h shows 6|pg||
pc|d4|pc|h6|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|d8|nt|petergill: William - except that the guy who gave me the 2@D/2@H advice is a current World Champion, so I like his advice. |pg||
mc|6|nt|the saint: IMPs to Wales as West got completely carried away over simple preference in the other room|pg||
nt|henryb: no imps as the board is a push|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@S might have gone -1 anyway, but is more likely to score up 110. |pg||

nt|mamos: NS found their good save here|pg||
nt|eggy: It seems that Jones & Bell had doubled 3D on hand 1|pg||
nt|eggy: somehow|pg||
nt|daman: I don't think experienced players would enter the auction as East David|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|mamos: 5@S now?|pg||
nt|mamos: 4NT B/wood?|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: or 3S or pass or 6s or 5S or...|pg||
nt|odysseus69: that wont stop east|pg||
nt|april7: 4th hand might balance|pg||
mb|1N|nt|eggy: I think I prefer that to the open room decision|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: no stopping East anyway|pg||
nt|odysseus69: i prefer 3S|pg||
nt|eggy: They will need to save 7 I suppose - |pg||
nt|eggy: but after the think, unlikely to save against 6 if West passes|pg||
nt|daman: right|pg||
mb|2C|nt|odysseus69: over 6s-pass - west should bid grand|pg||
nt|ralfwil: The disadvantage with 5@s is that E can draw the right conclusion |pg||
nt|oliverc: quite|pg||
nt|mamos: and West for that matter |pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree Victor!|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|eggy: I think that N should still bid and see what they do|pg||
nt|daman: partner rates to have 3@H's|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: http://bridgewebs.com/cgi-bin/bwg/display.cgi?pid=display_news&club=brunswick  for the tournament website|pg||
mb|3S|nt|daman: similar auction to board 2|pg||
nt|april7: since it was not a fit, 4th hand didn't balance|pg||
nt|dburn: well, you might bid 2@s over 2@h on the auction as it was, but I agree that it was a position in which neither side might have a great fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|oliverc: East pass here showing the void?|pg||
nt|daman: what was West thinking?|pg||
nt|mamos: EW a little over enthuisiastic here|pg||
nt|daman: East had his bid|pg||
nt|mamos: !|pg||
nt|daman: is that an undo operator?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ralfwil: now they must save in 7@s|pg||
nt|odysseus69: has to bid 7S now |pg||
nt|odysseus69: North not South|pg||
nt|eggy: He knows he must save 7 too, but Westmay think N must have a trick to bi 6S|pg||
nt|odysseus69: North has adopted the worst approach possible|pg||
mb|p|nt|eggy: But North puts the problem back to S :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|d5|pc|dA|nt|ralfwil: Here we have a combination of doubles P shows NO  or two defensive trick and S can now see that @cK probably is on side for declarer and must save|pg||
nt|april7: to high this time|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mamos: a double figure swing to England|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|Walddk4: For your information commentators and other spectators: three of the players at this table are young ladies. Only East is not. Pls remember (he/she)|pg||
nt|april7: lucky lead though for only 1 down|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dJ|nt|dburn: assuming that it was East and not North who bid 4@s, he certainly has his bid. West, on the other hand...|pg||
pc|h2|pc|d3|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c6|nt|daman: this will be another gain for Wales|pg||
pc|c2|nt|odysseus69: sorry- dont agree - North should simply bid 1 more spade wherever the oppo go|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|april7: might have made a short suit trial, denied by E|pg||
nt|daman: West was  trying to see if there was a star in the East (and I don't mean her partner)|pg||
nt|dburn: ...well, after this start she needs only spades 3-3 and a favourable club position|pg||

nt|daman: yawn|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|oliverc: I must confess I would be tempted to PASS over West's Double here. Bidding some|pg||
nt|oliverc: huge number of Spades immediately on such a weak hand can just make life easy|pg||
nt|oliverc: for Opps. Left to themselves, it's unlikely E/W will bid 7@H here.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If @cK was on N he had to double, showing a supposed trick |pg||
nt|vugraphzjj: cards played wrong - N kept diamonds|pg||
nt|odysseus69: yes - I still like 3S although I have been experimenting with xx|pg||
nt|dburn: put it this way - if I could allow my opponents to play a grand slam on a finesse on every board of a match, I would expect to win that match by a large margin|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 5@D can't stand a trump lead I think|pg||
nt|athene: that's a very aggressive 1@C opener|pg||
nt|athene: with no aces and a shape which is likely to be difficult to show|pg||
nt|henryb: I would not open as West because of the awkward rebids|pg||
nt|petergill: I would Pass, rather than open 1@C and rebid 2@C over the most likely response. but I know many experts who would open 1@C or 1@D.|pg||
nt|the saint: 2@D now, then Spades later if necessary to show 6-4 good hand|pg||
nt|athene: when partner, annoyingly but expectedly, responds in spades|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|athene: east obviously thinks 3@S is forcing - let's see if west agrees.....|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|the saint: Old-fashioned Acol-style bidding, this is only invitational|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 3NT, all pass, @h lead , -1 looks most likely |pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i have seen many pairs fall into a trap on this auction - in Acol, 3@S is just invitational|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No Henry, there is a U25 (Junior Camrose) and a U20 (Peggy Bayer). Ladies are welcome to compete in either|pg||
nt|athene: i think that playing weak jump shifts you should play it as forcing|pg||
pc|h4|nt|petergill: Me too|pg||
nt|henryb: Ah. I thought the Peggy B was a junior Lady Milne|pg||
nt|the saint: Not convinced EW are playing Weak jump Shifts|pg||
nt|athene: so 1@C - 2@S is about 3-7; 1@C - 1@S; 2@C - 2@S is 8-11; 1@C - 1@S; 2@C - 3@S is 12+ GF|pg||

pc|cK|nt|athene: ahhh the Bourke Relay|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s3|nt|petergill: Pass - 1@S - 2@C - 2@D - 3@D ... might lead to a happier contract. But that involves lots of unyouthlike conservative bidding. |pg||

pc|hQ|pc|s9|nt|the saint: Playing 12-14, you need to 2/1 on any hand that would want to be in game opposite a 15-17 NT. Too mauch danger of it going 1x-1NT- Pass (on a 15/poor 16 count) otherwise|pg||
pc|dT|nt|Walddk2: 5@D did not get the required trump lead next door. Tough from A10 I suppose|pg||

nt|petergill: Henry is right. If you are serious about your bridge, I think you should play (1) if opener rebids a 3rd suit, then 4th suit artificial and forcing (2) if opener rebids 1NT, 2@C ...|pg||
nt|petergill: (and/or 2@D perhaps) forcing and artificial, and (3) if opener rebids 2@C having opened 1@C, 2@D = forcing and artificial |pg||

pc|cA|nt|petergill: Ok, South and I differ this time, I'm all for leading partner's suit. |pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c8|pc|s2|pg||
pc|c9|nt|Walddk2: I think there are 30+ defences to 1NT. I recommend that you play either Meckwell or Woolsey against a strong NT, but a few other defences are also playable. Some are not, though. ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Capp is one of those|pg||
pc|d8|pc|h2|pc|d2|pg||
pc|c3|pc|d3|pc|h4|pc|d7|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s8|nt|henryb: I agree with you, Roland; I think Capp is unplayable against everything|pg||
nt|athene: the main consideration when choosing a defence to 1NT is whether you want to keep X as penalty-oriented (i.e. a strong hand)|pg||
nt|petergill: but her lead did not cost any tricks at all - 430 on any play. |pg||

pc|dT|pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
nt|athene: if you are prepared to give up the penalty double then Lional is the best i think (X = spades + another) but it's not widely-known|pg||
nt|the saint: Could East have not run the @S9? The Spade lead did potentially pick up the suit for declarer|pg||
mc|10|nt|petergill: Lionel|pg||
nt|athene: if you want the penalty double then 2@C = majors, with perhaps 2@D = 1 major|pg||

pc|dK|nt|mamos: NS have no losers but a lot of work to do|pg||
nt|daman: what possible reason would he have to continue after 4@H?   he would pass|pg||
nt|april7: 3@H or 4@H, which is stronger?|pg||
nt|mamos: yes the WElsh team also have played in the JC and PB for some years|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|dT|pg||
nt|daman: 3@H|pg||
nt|daman: leaves room for exploration|pg||
pc|h3|nt|odysseus69: 6H is enough although cards friendly for grand |pg||
nt|ralfwil: 13 tricks are easy with 2-2 in @h and 3-3 in @c|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hT|nt|april7: so E with 7 controls might invite for slam|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||

pc|dJ|nt|eggy: do you think 3S guarantees a void?|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d8|nt|eggy: otherwise 4NT would be rather imprecise i think|pg||
nt|april7: after a further Cue by W another cue by E|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|mamos: 6@C would have been interesting but the @d overcall cut the suit out|pg||
pc|sK|nt|dburn: should not bid either of them over 3@h - East has judged this pretty well|pg||

mb|p|nt|petergill: Its inventor is the late Lionel Wright from New Zealand|pg||

nt|athene: as the Chinese say:- "may you play in interesting contracts"|pg||
mb|2N|nt|henryb: not on this hand|pg||

mb|4S|mb|p|nt|henryb: ty Roland|pg||
nt|the saint: Oopps. Sorry Diane|pg||
nt|the saint: And Henry|pg||
nt|petergill: Well done by Northern Ireland - other than South's conservative Pass on Bd 10 costing 6 imps, Ruth and Kerri have conceded very few imps at this table. |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Next match in 20 minutes:  JC  NI vs Scotland|pg||
nt|Walddk2: correction|pg||
nt|Walddk2: NI vs England|pg||
nt|henryb: I guess Drury has not made its way to Wales|pg||
nt|Walddk2: NI vs Scotland in round 4|pg||
nt|petergill: 2NT by the passed hand = max pass with support|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|s3|nt|henryb: yes; we think that is what Drury was invented for|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well Henry, Wales is not a nation as such, so perhaps Doug Drury never went there?|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s7|pc|s8|pg||
nt|petergill: South passed 1@s because the vulnerability and shape were both most unsuitable for 3@H. |pg||

nt|henryb: I understand, but it has porous borders (even I crossed them once or twice) so one would think the news of Drury might have made it there in the fifty odd years since its invention|pg||
pc|hT|nt|petergill: Drury might be almost routine in America, but it is far from universal elsewhere in the world. |pg||

pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h9|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c7|pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dQ|nt|henryb: I would say that Drury is the third or fourth most useful convention, after Stayman, negative doubles and Blackwood|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: drury was frowned on in england by some sections of the bridge population at one time|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|sA|pc|h4|pc|s4|pc|c5|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|athene: since people realised you could open 1@S in 3rd on something like @Sxxx @Hxx @Dxx @CKQJxxx with it|pg||
pc|h8|nt|henryb: and comes up more often than Stayman or Blackwood|pg||
pc|s9|nt|petergill: Europeans do not have to play everything that comes from America. I think the Irish should be free to forgo Bergen Raises, and even skip eating McDonalds if they want to. |pg||

mc|10|nt|Walddk2: Thx all|pg||
nt|athene: thanks everyone...|pg||
nt|henryb: Perverted minors are also a great improvement and fairly frequent |pg||
nt|petergill: Bob Hamman shares Henry's views - he once put Reverse Drury at the top of his list of favourite conventions, I think|pg||
nt|henryb: bye all|pg||
nt|petergill: I would rate playing 2@H - 3@D and 2@S - 3@d as artificial raises as being more important than playing Drury. Yet how many Americans play that 3@D idea which is fairly common in ...|pg||
nt|petergill: parts of Poland?|pg||

nt|oliverc: lol|pg||
nt|odysseus69: cards again friendly for 4S- an unlikely spot|pg||
nt|daman: final board of the set now|pg||
nt|april7: it depends whether 3@D is gameforce or just raise to at least 3@H|pg||
nt|mamos: last board now|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|april7: another 4@S by EW|pg||
mb|3H|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|mamos: Yes Victor I was thinking EW might get too high but if they do they may make game :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: I don´t like weak nt with a 5-card major|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|odysseus69: happy with 1Nt rather than 1S?|pg||
nt|oliverc: I hve a religious aversion to 1NT here :)|pg||
nt|eggy: I would usually, but I think this a suit oriented hand|pg||
nt|mamos: thanks to the spectators and to your commentators , George Avram David and Steve|pg||
nt|mamos: thanks to the players and Philip our operator  Good job|pg||
nt|april7: thank you all and bye till next time we meet|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mamos: The Spade suit has good texture  prefer 1@S|pg||
nt|ralfwil: perhaps with 5 small in the major|pg||
nt|eggy: Not that I'd be totally happy if East responds 2D|pg||
nt|mamos: thanks to NIBU especially Sandie the match organiser and BGB|pg||
pc|h9|nt|mamos: i think playing 15-17 it's different - but prefer 5 card Stayman then as well|pg||
nt|mamos: lastly thanks to you all for spending time with us on BBO|pg||
pc|hT|nt|odysseus69: there are 2 schools of thought - (1) all 5-3-3-2 hands in range should open 1NT and (2) touchy-feely- some yes and some no|pg||
nt|oliverc: what about (3) Never!! ?? LOL|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s3|pc|sK|pc|s7|pg||
pc|s2|pc|d3|nt|odysseus69: those in the always 1NT school include Andrew Robson and Chris Dixon|pg||
pc|sA|nt|odysseus69: plaaying strong NT the choice is not available|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If W opens with 1@s EW probably had reached 4@s|pg||
nt|mamos: The score is still 0-0 because we have no comparisons yet - I guess that there will be quite a few imps swapping hands in a moment|pg||
nt|odysseus69: I am a touchy-feely but in the interests of partner harmony I have decided to go with 1NT for a while but I am keeping a note now |pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|pc|d2|pc|d8|pg||
nt|oliverc: I must confess, opening the West hand with 1NT when 2@C isn't 5-card Stayman|pg||
nt|oliverc: seems a little self-defeating to me|pg||
nt|odysseus69: I suspect that even with 1S opener they would have stopped in 3S which looks enough|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d9|pc|d4|pc|dT|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hQ|pc|hJ|pc|h3|pg||
pc|c7|nt|odysseus69: 4S looks as if it needs heart finesse + 3-3 hearts - although in practice the spade position helps|pg||
