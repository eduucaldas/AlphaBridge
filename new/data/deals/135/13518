nt|rhelle: excuse my typos, please|pg||
mb|1H|an|!C + !H or !S|nt|rhelle: 1@s from North shows 4+@s and 0-5 points|pg||
mb|d|mb|2C!|an|pass / correct|nt|rhelle: but he may like his hand, and upgrade it to 6-8 - and pass|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|rhelle: ah, they switched the meaning of X and 1@s (the way I play it)|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle: so X = 0-5 with 4+@s|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rhelle: this looks like it will just make - East won't gain the lead to play a @h through|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|pc|sT|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sA|pc|s7|pc|d4|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|nt|rhelle: that looks more likely :)|pg||
mb|2H|an|!Ss + minor, weak or strong|nt|rhelle: with 55 majors South has to open 1@h|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rhelle: I guess East will know what suits his partner has|pg||
nt|rhelle: and North is smelling blood|pg||
nt|rhelle: of course, NS can't make much themselves - so defending looks a better option|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|an|not forcing|mb|p|nt|rhelle: Maybe North's double created a forcing situation, where X = takeout and pass = forcing|pg||
nt|rhelle: I dare say that most people would play X as penalties now|pg||
mb|d|an|takeout|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rhelle: it's also possible that X showed some strength, and pass is simply NF - their notes don't mentio it|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|rhelle: will he lead a low trump?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|rhelle: South will take the ace and switch to a trump - double quick|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hK|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Kalita getting some drinks for the players|pg||

mb|1N|an|GF relay|mb|p|nt|rhelle: and I thnk there are lots more to come - let's see if they can bid 7|pg||
mb|2C|nt|rhelle: 2@C = natural|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D!|mb|d|nt|rhelle: 2@d = relay, 3@d = exactly 5-3-4-1|pg||
nt|rhelle: 5-3-1-4, sorry|pg||
nt|rhelle: ah - he wins 2 steps, so he'll bid 2NT now|pg||
nt|rhelle: passs = 1, XX = 2, rest is as normal|pg||
mb|2N|an|5!s 3!H 1!D 4!C|mb|p|nt|rhelle: 3@c = strong relay, 3@d = weak relay|pg||
nt|rhelle: I think North is not interested in points; just controls|pg||
nt|rhelle: so I guess he'll bid 3@c now|pg||
mb|3C!|mb|p|nt|rhelle: 4@c shows 6 controls|pg||
nt|rhelle: (A=2, K=1)|pg||
mb|4C|an|6 controls A=2 K=1|mb|p|nt|rhelle: and that will exite North; a single K wouldn't count, so now he knows the 3 aces|pg||
nt|rhelle: he'll start to scan for key cards now, to discover the @hQ|pg||
mb|4D!|mb|p|nt|rhelle: 4@d starts the spiral scan|pg||
mb|5C|an|showing !S!C!H A/K denying 2nd !S honour|nt|rhelle: 5@c shows top cards in @s, @c and @h erspectively, and denies a 2nd @s honour|pg||
nt|rhelle: which is good news|pg||
nt|rhelle: 5@s asks|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D!|nt|rhelle: 5@d, sorry|pg||
mb|p|mb|5H!|nt|rhelle: 5@h denies a 2nd top honour in @c|pg||
mb|p|mb|5S!|nt|rhelle: but now a snag appears|pg||
mb|p|mb|6C!|mb|p|nt|rhelle: ok :)|pg||
nt|rhelle: 6@c shows a 2nd @h honour|pg||
mb|7C!|an|he knows the hand now|nt|rhelle: so North will bid 7@c now|pg||
nt|rhelle: impressive !!!|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cJ|mc|13|nt|rhelle: interesting ... if the X hadn't appeared, they would have had 2 steps less - not enough to find the @hQ|pg||
pg||

nt|imp_jan: how?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: *their, of course :)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ralfwil: a possible 6@d on EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: 4@h and a minor suit?|pg||
nt|mcphee: do not play A@C?|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|yuval10: 2@h suppose to be good raise with 8+ points|pg||
nt|sybarra: and E asking for minor |pg||
nt|ralfwil: and now it´s easy to find @cQ in 6@d|pg||
nt|yuval10: how many @s's now?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 4@s I think:)|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|sybarra: needs a @D lead or shift after hts, to beat 3 @S |pg||
nt|chick: I don't think E has enough controls to carry on to 6, but N might push him to it with 5@S|pg||
nt|yuval10: who's thinking now, i wonder|pg||
nt|yuval10: probably East|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Yes and we can find that with our cuebids - no problem|pg||
mb|2H|nt|sfoxa:  one more example of BD system|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: This could be regular Stayman|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: And Drijver figuring out how high he should bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: 4@d will go down 1, the defence isn't suppose to be any difficult|pg||
nt|sybarra: well....that was fleeting |pg||
nt|mcphee: i got here at the end as you did so was only a fast look|pg||
nt|imp_jan: ineteresting|pg||
nt|mcphee: well 100% it is getting ruffed|pg||
nt|imp_jan: agree|pg||
nt|imp_jan: book play then|pg||
nt|fabsayc: could be but i am betting against that|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: It just went irregular|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3c secondary transfer, that part i understand|pg||
nt|iceblue: whats the range of 1NT?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: 15-17|pg||
nt|ralfwil: sry private|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|imp_jan: good analysis!|pg||
mb|3C|nt|frankaus: g'day all|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: Welcome to Frank Budai from Down Under :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: and 3s singleton|pg||
nt|iceblue: 2@S after 2@S shows INV with 5cards+ @S, not promise @Hs|pg||
nt|yuval10: after the bidding i guess it won't be too hard to find the Q@c|pg||
mb|3H|nt|sybarra: ok now for -2 maybe |pg||
nt|yuval10: probably|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|nt|fabsayc: all part of a method developed in sweden called scanian|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|mcphee: this will depend on the @D guess which I expect E to make correctly|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: Maybe 3@D instead of X by N would've been more descriptive?|pg||
nt|mcphee: i like dble|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  with N hand, @s lead looks better|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: more ways to win|pg||
nt|imp_jan: prefer dbl indeed, south cld have wests spades and pass|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: True enough|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: looks makeable from this seat, but in practise i doubt will suceed|pg||
mb|5H|nt|sfoxa:  this time, declarer's work is even harder|pg||
mb|p|mb|5N|mb|p|nt|mcphee: yes N showed his 5@H with no game interest, so dble is just a "lets compete" bid|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzgp: q|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|yuval10: don't know what was the urgency to play @c now from S|pg||

nt|rhelle: 3@d + 3 open?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C!|an|16+|nt|rhelle: I don't think I've ever seen so many aces and kings disappear :)|pg||
nt|rhelle: especially as a wrong @c guess would sink the contract|pg||
nt|rhelle: here declarer won't do that, of course - without the @c Ace North will have only 15 points max|pg||

nt|yuval10: and all the cards lie perfectl for them|pg||
nt|yuval10: so many tricks available|pg||
nt|mcphee: might play 6@S |pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: I figured N wouldn't like a 3@C bid by S, but with Kx it's not the worst that could happen and X allows p to pass as well|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: :)|pg||
nt|frankaus: nows the volcano dust in poland? planes flying?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: Yeah, though the plane the Polish took was delayed, don't know because of what|pg||
nt|yuval10: but i bet declarer would've got it right anyway|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  time for NS to demonstrate bidding after 1NT (if no strong club system)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|iceblue: i am serarch in Ecatsbridge, hope we could get there CC|pg||
mb|d|nt|sybarra: looks like we are playing 16 bds. this set and OR started with 15 16 |pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: At the end of the weekend flights should be resumed as scheduled|pg||
nt|frankaus: that would be nice|pg||
mb|2C|mb|2S|nt|mcphee: S has a very suitable hand for the @S slam|pg||
nt|fabsayc: maybe too good for off shape 1nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzgp: Yeah, I think this one counts as reversable :)|pg||
mb|3D|nt|frankaus: looks like transfer advance to @H|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: TD just took the EW cc, possibly to upload/copy it...|pg||
nt|iceblue: mb 2 way re-drury?|pg||
nt|chick: sure, and S knew declarer would get it right if missing the Q, so might as well try for the @CA|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like they'll reach 2/3NT here, cards are badly placed for them|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: and a "happy" 3 nt fro E,  or 4 nt quanti?|pg||
nt|yuval10: i don't think he'll sell out so quickly|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 @H maybe then  to keep it going |pg||
nt|sybarra: can make 6 @D with the right guesses |pg||
nt|yuval10: the 2 pairs from Israel in this tournement will both represent Israel in the upcomming European championship in Ostende, Belgium|pg||
nt|sybarra: would 3 @D be forcing  I am not sure of their system |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  agree, 5-4 with such reverse - is OK|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceblue: 2@D shows 4+cards @S|pg||
nt|frankaus: ah drury i'm told|pg||
pc|sT|nt|yuval10: along with a 3rd pair, Ilan and Ofir Herbst|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok quanti,  (I should stick with first thought) |pg||
nt|yuval10: W has a minimum, i'm not sure he'd like his KJ doubleton @h either, and his 5 cards suit isn't too good either|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Welcome to Andy Vinock|pg||
nt|mcphee: hi Andy|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: Welcome to the studio Andy :)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  moreover, several pairs (playing non-forcing stayman) have agreement that 1NT opening promises at least 3-2 in majors|pg||
nt|iceblue: 2@S=light opening|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|nt|fabsayc: 2@S is a trap, as really there is no sound game|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: Yes, I've got the cc here now|pg||
pc|dK|nt|yuval10: pass is very reasonable , unlucky that it all breaks so well|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 nt is logical place to play |pg||
nt|sybarra: some days (many for me) it doesnt break this well |pg||
nt|sybarra: the minor suit breaks make this hand |pg||

pc|s3|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|imp_jan: but what can he do, he is not the captain of the bidding|pg||
nt|andyv:  asking for 2nd rd control?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: @C2 for a @D return, I think|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: Or at least showing @D values|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  W has to be brave enough|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  underlead his @d ace|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: @DA-@Dx works as well, no?|pg||

nt|mcphee: S has misunderstood 6@C|pg||
nt|mcphee: either that or a caddy is sitting in for this hand:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  looks like 5N may have been pick a slam from S's perspective|pg||
nt|mcphee: it is beginning to seem that S did not thing 4N was rkc|pg||

mb|1C|nt|andyv:  all games for EW seemed doomed|pg||
nt|andyv:  maybe 4@s has the best shot|pg||

nt|iceblue: must be, S would dble if play STR 1@C|pg||
mb|d|nt|mcphee: that is true, but I think this must be 3N not 4|pg||

mb|2C|nt|mcphee: likely @S lead|pg||
nt|imp_jan: remember brd 2, where @CQ shld have ducked by decl?|pg||
nt|andyv:  lead certainly doesn't hurt|pg||
nt|mcphee: well it will all come down to the @D suit in any case|pg||
nt|imp_jan: in the other match barel ducked indeed!|pg||
nt|mcphee: looking like 2-4 leads for the Poles|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: Only vs NT, vs suit they lead odd|pg||
nt|imp_jan: though in the middle of the game, decl got a spade lead, and eventually made 4@H dbl|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: Or so it seems from previous boards|pg||
nt|mcphee: is this really 4N Bas?|pg||

mb|p|nt|Vugraphzgp: Waldemar plays with the NS pair in North American tournaments frequently|pg||
