nt|brolucius: Most players would open 1@H on the East cards, because it is a good suit to mention (the main test when you are thinking of a light opening).|pg||
mb|1N|an|16-18 "balanced"|mb|2H|nt|cuttysark: But you can often overcall a good major at your second turn, thus avoiding the stratosphere|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dA|nt|brolucius: Hard to understand why West did not raise to 2@H at the other table.|pg||
nt|andyv:  with big club bidders, the value of preempting out of their comfort zone may make opening 1@h even more appealing|pg||
pc|d4|nt|cuttysark: Probably thought he would do better defending 1NT|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Because they play canape|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is an absolute miracle that East had the chance to mention his hearts on the second round. Obvious to open, I would say.|pg||
nt|andyv:  hand plays very well for declarer|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: 1@H is either 5332 @Hs or 4@Hs 5 minor|pg||

pc|d2|nt|sybarra: they just drew the wrong pards,  e and n should be pards, and S and W  (for the suits they have) |pg||
pc|d8|nt|sybarra: this will be a challenge,  not sure I can see 9 tricks  |pg||
nt|sybarra: I can find 8   |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  2-suits overcalls are recommended for all the time - if you aren't strong enough, opps will play knowing your shape exactly |pg||

pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: We will see if the defenders can take their six winners in the black suits. It may not be easy.|pg||

nt|yuval10: how many @s's now?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 4@s I think:)|pg||
mb|4S|mb|5D|nt|sybarra: needs a @D lead or shift after hts, to beat 3 @S |pg||

pc|c7|nt|fabsayc: is it obvious to play clubs before trumps, not clear to me|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: W's @HK shouldn't be in E, because S could've given N a @C ruff if it was|pg||
nt|frankaus: trying for short @C K|pg||
pc|c5|nt|sfoxa:  if clubs are 2-2 - doesn't matter (if 4-0 - too)|pg||

mb|2N|an|!cs or !Ds|mb|p|nt|andyv:  macho dbl by W|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Ginossar waits to bid over the strong club auction so show a better hand than bidding right away|pg||
mb|3C|nt|andyv:  now 3@d?|pg||
nt|andyv:  3@s|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, but he still has not named his suit!|pg||
nt|cuttysark: North employing some sort of lebensohl|pg||
mb|3S|nt|andyv:  i would have shown the majors and then bid @s with the W hand... I don't like waiting around|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: I would have bid 1@S immediately. No matter that it might be weak. It will not be passed out and you can bid strongly thereafter.  If partner raises, you can bid game.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Doesn't look as if spades will play all that well either|pg||
nt|andyv:  one entry to dummy|pg||
nt|brolucius: You can see from East's pass that he places West with a giant hand after these manoeuvres.|pg||
nt|brolucius: East's pause, I meant.|pg||
nt|andyv:  may get expensive if E raises|pg||
nt|brolucius: Even so, I don't think East has enough to advance.|pg||
nt|andyv:  with K@d probably a dead card, E should give up the ghost but vul is tempting him|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 1NT quite strong - and he has a 4-3-3-3 working not-very-much count. |pg||
nt|cuttysark: Mind you, this is the man who jumped to 2@S on a 3count|pg||
nt|brolucius: A vulnerable 2@S over 1NT (on the second round) would show a strong hand, so by doubling and then bidding 3@S, West is saying 'Go on with anything at all useful'|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  good pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Nothing in the East hand is at all useful, as he has concluded.|pg||
pc|h4|nt|andyv:  this lead certainly doesn't hurt W|pg||
pc|h2|nt|andyv:  I guess Simon felt he needed to make an attacking lead|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Had to lead something|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: he asked about the @Hs and they concluded that with this hand you would show majors and then @ss|pg||
nt|cuttysark: So West's sequence was more successful than he perhaps deserved|pg||
nt|andyv:  so, if I were playing, I'd never get a @h lead... have to put that in my book|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: seems like EW are not on the same line on that or W thinks this is a single suiter|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s9|pc|s3|pc|s2|pg||
pc|s5|pc|c6|pc|sJ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|brolucius: Better to bid 1@S and then 3@H, so that partner can note the absence of a 'both majors' call and place you with 6-4.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: SHowing both majors when 6-4 is dangerous - especially when you have 4 hearts|pg||
mc|9|nt|brolucius: Yes, and his spades are pretty good too.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: partr bids his 3-card suits upwards as East did here, and you never know what to do next|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes, all depends on partnership agreements|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: some discussions now, I guess they will call the director|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: as they just did|pg||
nt|brolucius: North must feel that the explanation on what West would have done with hearts affected his choice of opening lead.|pg||
nt|andyv:  doesn't seem like N has much to stand on|pg||
nt|brolucius: A heart seemed a reasonable choice anyway.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Some players take the attitude that you have nothing to lose by calling the director. (Not these players, I am sure. It is a general comment.)|pg||
nt|andyv:  W can interpret his hand anyway he wants.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, and he can bid it how he wants.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: There are times when you might want to call the director to protest about partner's bidding|pg||
nt|andyv:  N has a director call only if E was aware about something in the auction and failed to disclose it|pg||
nt|andyv:  my partners do that all the time|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You call the director when you feel that you might have been damaged by a 'wrong' explanation; then you present your case and let the TD make a ruling, now or later. That is normal ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: procedure|pg||
nt|andyv:  I only get procedural penalties|pg||
nt|Walddk2: There is absolutely nothing wrong with calling the director|pg||

mb|p|pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|c2|nt|Vugraphzgp: Not many people do it, but some open 19 BAL with 2NT systematically, which would probably lead to a 4@S contract in S|pg||

pc|s6|pc|s9|nt|sybarra: is "lucky"  but well bid by them |pg||
nt|Gerben42: 2@C forced 2@D then 2NT shows some big hand|pg||

nt|Gerben42: ruff the @C lead and play @H7?|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
pc|s8|nt|sfoxa:  as an option, yes|pg||

pc|s3|pc|sK|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|c7|nt|Vugraphzgp: Looks like Brink was master after all|pg||
nt|Gerben42: well done in probably the longest Dutch auction in history by a pair not playing Tarzan|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  modern agressive bidding makes W open 1@c, but thereafter E has to put on system or imagination to believe in that partner's @c |pg||

nt|Vugraphzgp: lol Martin|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c9|pc|cT|pg||
pc|h6|nt|yuval10: N did 1 trick more than expected, but it was still not enough|pg||
pc|h7|nt|Gerben42: Drijver responded 1@D, then bid 2@C puppet and jumped to 2NT, that reduced his hand type to "strong @D"|pg||
nt|Gerben42: so now the question is if you play one round of @D before the @H or not|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  can allow it|pg||

mb|1D|mb|1S|nt|sybarra: probably a cheerful quiet pass from W |pg||
nt|sybarra: or does S bid again?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: 5@C in S would probably be made, 5@C in N would probably go down, funny things, leads.|pg||
nt|yuval10: hard to pass when your P free-bided with 4@h and you have 20 points. S is also considering the fact his partner is a passed hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: a lot to think about |pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: I agree|pg||

mb|p|nt|Gerben42: 5@C a control bid, just how N didnt mean RKC|pg||

nt|Vugraphzgp: If 2@C is either weak @D or strong, 3@D is probably barrage, right?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|yuval10: very good decision by S|pg||
nt|andyv:  with vul, W has to invite|pg||
nt|mcphee: only see 8|pg||
nt|iceblue: 4@H is the best?|pg||
nt|fann4: A light overcall by E, vul too, but the 5431 shape and @DK make it better|pg||
mb|d!|nt|Vugraphzgp: I think the fact that Pachtman had already passed was important in Ginossar's decision to pass 4@H|pg||
nt|yuval10: W also did very well here to bid only 3@s, knowing that he has a very good def. against 4@h|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 2@C can be weak from Pachtman? the auction suggests otherwise|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: BD being shown 'nother way to slam :)|pg||

nt|fann4: N should have 5@D for this action, so 3@D safer than 2NT now|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|mcphee: E being minimum will give up|pg||
mb|3D|nt|Gerben42: better than @S anyway|pg||
nt|Gerben42: probably worth 2 IMPs|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: just unsure how Pachtman knows Ginossar didnt have a singleton @C|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|fann4: So N rescues himself to 3@D - he could be facing a doubleton opposite.|pg||

pc|dA|nt|Vugraphzgp: Waldemar plays with the NS pair in North American tournaments frequently|pg||

mb|2S|mb|p|nt|val44: I think they play 3s is xfer to 3NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mcphee: perhaps they play a weaker NT ranger there, like 13-15|pg||

nt|mcphee: dummy lacks entries to pick up the @D suit I think|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: Now it's Jansma's turn to take a brb|pg||
nt|andyv:  may have to win first S i dummy and  immediately finesse the J@d|pg||

nt|mcphee: so now we know the K @H is onside|pg||
nt|andyv:  he's looking for his @s amongst all the black cards|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgp: The 6@S with xxx opp. AQxxx lost 13 IMPs to a 4@S+1 OR|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes, they had a more old fashioned auction in the OR|pg||

nt|Vugraphzgp: Now only -1 though|pg||
nt|ralfwil: why not a @s lead?|pg||

pc|c6|pc|s3|pc|cA|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s5|pc|s6|pg||
nt|brolucius: Maybe single-suit escape. East bids 2@C and West then passes or bids his suit (a guess, of course).|pg||

mb|p|pc|d7|nt|brolucius: The 4@S bid was OK. I am still trying to understand the 2@S bid.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: It is cetainly a bold bid, but I have a feeling the double is some sort of 2-suiter or maybe shows spades, so the jump is pre-emptive|pg||
nt|andyv:  4-1 @s break should scuttle this contract|pg||
nt|andyv:  it said dbl was the majors|pg||
nt|cuttysark: majors, but not necessarily so strong|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Just needs heart 3-3 and spades 3-2. Not a bad game :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3@S by West might have been read as increasing the barrier, not a genuine try, so West has to go the whole way to game (as he saw it).|pg||
nt|andyv:  true, W has a good hand so only question is what did he expect for E's 2@s bid.|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  this contract isn't too pretty|pg||

pc|h8|nt|andyv:  can't understand E's 4@h bid (if 2@s denies 3@hs)|pg||
nt|cuttysark: West is about to explain that the lack of Support Double means he cannot have 3 hearts. Can't imagine what East is going to say|pg||
nt|andyv:  maybe S took it as a good @h raise|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: East explained it to North|pg||
