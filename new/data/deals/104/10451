nt|ady: North is short  of tricks    may feel the need to finesse 10@D|pg||
nt|ady: if he takes this finesse can make with an end play on east|pg||
nt|raghavan: Ha and CAQ are with E so take 3 Spades and 2 Diamonds - let us see what E will throw- anyhow may end 1 down |pg||
nt|ady: only problem is dedclarer may be squeezed before east if he cashed the diamonds|pg||

mb|p|nt|ralfwil: For me it looks like a @d lead is the onlyway to make|pg||
mb|3C|nt|ady: declarer should have played a low diamond at trick 2 and ruffed  and taken discard   if west had dducked the 2nd diamond would have gone down     a kib spooted this|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: if N is 13-15, W will bid 2Nt |pg||
nt|raghavan: If NT = 13-15|pg||
nt|ralfwil: WD EW!|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|xenya: i'm not sure about that 3N...|pg||
mb|3N|nt|don paulus: kind of gambling|pg||
nt|xenya: what do you think?|pg||
nt|raghavan: 2C+2D+ SA and a ruff|pg||
nt|vugraphztn: Niels is known to be a "bidder" :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Good evaluation by West with his three small hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: common for 1M-2NT to show limit raise + |pg||
nt|raghavan: well bid without much fuss|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that is, a raise to 3M or better|pg||
nt|ady: seems 2NT here is a limit raise or better |pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|xenya: both N and E are it seems|pg||
nt|mmmakela: I kind of like it so pass?|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Mike from Uk here hi Vladimir hi Makela|pg||

mb|p|nt|suketbombi: six@S a good contract wud be push here|pg||
nt|lestergold: this could go well if declarer runsthe 9 of dims now|pg||
nt|ady: will need to establish a diamond trick for the 8th|pg||
nt|raghavan: correctly stopped in 2NT = 3S+3H+2C |pg||
nt|raghavan: Hi Mike - gald to work with you again'|pg||
nt|ady: will eventually lose 1 daimond trick in addition|pg||
mb|p|pc|cT|pc|c4|pc|c2|nt|ralfwil: or find @hAx|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|raghavan: e Ave, lead that . since declarere may have singleton K in that suit|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s7|nt|lestergold: presumably the dim play is completely marked by the bidding and lack of lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  5@h would have been a decent save|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|april7: W will discard 2 @S on KQ of @D and ruff a @H in dumy|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hQ|pc|hA|nt|xenya: E just might have passed over N's pass, but i think he would have raised all the same|pg||

nt|pab1: hi all|pg||
nt|stew: they should have an easy road to 4H and no higher|pg||
nt|pab1: 2NT some type of good Heart raise.  |pg||
mb|3D|mb|4H|nt|pab1: West is minimum in high cards, but should accept because of his extra shape and Aces|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jimkrek: they play that as a good heart raise with shortness-John cd have relayed to ask|pg||
nt|Vugraphu2: Drew asks whether if Onstott asked for splinter it would be coded, and Onstott says yes|pg||
nt|pab1: Note Berk's Vul vs Non-Vul 3D bid.  Usually pretty safe when the opps have a fit and are on their way to game.  Might help partner with the lead|pg||
pc|h3|nt|jimkrek: though they might not have worked it out over 3ds:)|pg||

nt|ady: part score hand    lijkely 1NT e/w|pg||
nt|ralfwil: happy to find @sA on side|pg||
nt|april7: but the way the defnce was he didn't need it|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: part score hand |pg||
nt|xenya: missed that somehow|pg||
mb|2D|nt|lestergold: e/w cold for heart game!|pg||
nt|lestergold: but hard to reqach|pg||
nt|ralfwil: after @hQ he must have bad thoughts about @sA|pg||
nt|april7: 1NT by N and E will X and then we will see|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ady: diamond contract for e/w looks best|pg||
nt|xenya: we know what 2@C means!|pg||
mb|3D|nt|xenya: @Ds or a strong hand, i've been told|pg||
nt|april7: XX = @C?|pg||
nt|andyv:  south will bail out in @cs|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mmmakela: Mike is it allowed to have a weak option in 2 @C strong in UK?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: awkward for North over 1NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: unless he has a natural 2@D available....|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: not that 2@D is likely to be much of a success|pg||
mb|p|nt|suketbombi: lead down to 41 imps here but then there is a 1100 on bd 32|pg||
nt|raghavan: May lead C|pg||
nt|lestergold: i dont think so|pg||
nt|mdgraham: redouble can be used as a puppet to 2@C, in order to play in 2 of a minor |pg||
nt|april7: if its not forcing , W should pass|pg||
nt|mdgraham: which allows 2@C to be stayman, as other bids as system on |pg||
pc|h3|nt|ady: no-trump opening kept e/w out of bidding|pg||
nt|lestergold: wello best defence will see this about 2 off|pg||
nt|lestergold: but e/w can make a dim contract|pg||
nt|lestergold: not normally|pg||
nt|mmmakela: neither in Finland|pg||
pc|h2|nt|suketbombi: 47|pg||
nt|raghavan: Invitation which W will refuse |pg||
nt|ady: n/s  better in spades    but south has no good reason to bid|pg||
pc|h8|nt|lestergold: yet as cards lie 5 frigid|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3nt on W, but they will find their 4-4 in @h?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but a quiet finish to the auction|pg||
nt|andyv:  that's surprising|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|ady: this can go down 3 on best defence|pg||
nt|lestergold: cash in right order maybe 3 off with a trump promoted|pg||
nt|xenya: who is to blame here, if anyone?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: must admit I wd've bid 4 as E|pg||
nt|lestergold: no one|pg||
nt|april7: but only 2 @D are in|pg||
pc|sA|nt|raghavan: Ca and High C|pg||
pc|s4|nt|suketbombi: sorry even now it is 59 too many diartractions here|pg||

nt|Vugraphu2: Drew: "only time it's not coded is when it goes 1N-2N, then bid singleton?" Onstott: "no, always coded"|pg||
nt|pab1: could have been held to 7 tricks, for an IMP|pg||
nt|stew: still no blood this set|pg||
mb|p|nt|pab1: Onstott times the play correctly for the overtrick -- starting Spades while there were enough entries to the dummy|pg||

mb|1D|nt|april7: 4@S to be made with Q of @H as entry to @S finesse|pg||

mb|p|nt|don paulus: repeat @h now ?|pg||

nt|april7: best lead though not t:)o be found is Q of @C|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|lestergold: this sequence guarantees that east does not have heart support|pg||
nt|raghavan: Don it is not repeating - going all the way to game|pg||
nt|mdgraham: oh well, so much for that prediction|pg||
nt|ady: South has some good defense with partner in the bidding|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ady: borderline double from south 2nd time round    shows hearts|pg||
nt|lestergold: a vulnerable effort with that ropey spade suit 3h i think a level too high|pg||
nt|ady: this finesse would help|pg||
nt|wolwerine: As you can see NS play a light style with overcalls|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|lestergold: it served itsb purpose pushing n/s probably too high|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3h a rather unsound back in|pg||
nt|lestergold: could have been humungously horrid east could have an even better hand with a spade misfit|pg||
nt|vugraphztn: both pairs play in the first division in Denmark - and have all 4 been playing for Denmark|pg||
nt|raghavan: Thanks Jan|pg||
nt|vugraphztn: NS has especially been very good in pairs tournaments|pg||
nt|ady: no doubt the 9@S  will later be finessed|pg||
pc|s5|nt|andyv:  or small @c and @h switch|pg||

pc|s8|nt|raghavan: Jan can u tell us what system they play - I know weak NT + what?|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Maybe Røn could have investigated after 6@C. Plenty of room. I agree with Knut|pg||
pc|dK|pg||

pc|c2|nt|raghavan: Knut - your brother is really aggressive - worth it|pg||

nt|andyv:  yeap|pg||
mb|4S|nt|suketbombi: 3nt by NS but unlikely to be there 4@H dn 1  seems to normal|pg||
nt|mmmakela: sure maybe "commanding" was an overbid|pg||
nt|wolwerine: Ligner 500|pg||
nt|wolwerine: Looks like 500|pg||
nt|andyv:  not just say it, he was adament about it.|pg||

nt|xenya: back to down |pg||

nt|ralfwil: How did NS go down in 4@s on board no 33?|pg||
nt|vugraphztn: 1NT - 3 NT  :)|pg||
nt|wolwerine: I guess North was trying to make up for board 32|pg||
nt|vugraphztn: players back|pg||
mb|1D|nt|april7: NS might reach 3NT and again going down|pg||
nt|vugraphztn: 3NT makes on last board|pg||
mb|3C|nt|raghavan: EW to play in 4H |pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|april7: N might bid only 2NT??|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|april7: or 2@H inquiring again about stopper|pg||
nt|april7: S needn't have A STOPPER IF HE BIDS !Nt|pg||
nt|andyv:  any reason for S to accept?|pg||
nt|wolwerine: Northe is not pushing NV|pg||
nt|april7: NO|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: e/w   likely to play in 4@H    will have to guess well to male|pg||
nt|ady: make|pg||
mb|p|nt|raghavan: DK may be the lead - let us see|pg||
nt|april7: but after 2@H S bids only 2 NT and >N passes|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cA|pc|c2|nt|ady: I would think down 1|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
pc|h4|nt|wolwerine: Maybe West should double - he knows they need points|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree with X. also with @dA|pg||
pc|h2|nt|april7: but even 2NT doesn't make|pg||
pc|hA|nt|raghavan: Play Club A and DK - declarer may think that N has shown all points- S may have HQ|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|pc|d2|nt|wolwerine: Normally you would be satisfied with 50 or 100, but West knows they are behind and the boards are running out|pg||
