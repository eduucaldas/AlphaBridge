nt|oleberg: NS play a strong club system|pg||
nt|Walddk2: N-S play Realy Precision, E-W natural|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Relay  even|pg||
nt|jcwla: There's precise and then there's really precise.|pg||
nt|oleberg: Called "Rele presisjon" in Norway and Denmark, and "Wiking Club" internationally.|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|ady: e/w have 11 tricks in hearts    n/s could dac in spades|pg||
nt|jni33: One table has already played board 1. Result was: N 5@s DBL made 9 tricks .. 300 for EW|pg||
nt|ady: sac|pg||
nt|ady: not easy fpr west|pg||
nt|hawe45:  The problem by bidding 5 @H now - if it can make, partner raises|pg||
mb|5H|nt|hawe45:  Could one pass with the East-hand now?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5@H is a view at these colours. Not obvious|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Exactly Hans|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That's why 5@H is not automatic|pg||
nt|jcwla: Felt did not come here to def 4@S w/this hand.|pg||
mb|p|mb|6H|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: as you said Hans|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I would have done the same as Rasmussen|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ady: great result for n/s|pg||
nt|jcwla: Here's a case where any time taken may unintentionally suggest "pls don't raise."|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|sT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not really here|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|s4|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But the slam is not so bad - @D Jack could bevhave|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Walddk2: They are playing with screens and South and West are on the same side|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c8|pc|c3|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cK|pc|cT|nt|Walddk2: So East can't know who paused when the tray comes back to her|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
mc|11|nt|Walddk2: That's the advantage of playing with screens|pg||
nt|ady: I dont thin it takes much of a guess who was thinking|pg||
nt|jcwla: Well -- maybe -- 4@S more common over 2@S than 5@H over 4@S|pg||
nt|ady: east bid her hand honestly   cant ask for more than that|pg||
nt|jcwla: right|pg||
pg||

nt|jni33: One table has already played board 2. Result was: N 4@h made 9 tricks .. 100 for EW .. lead was @c 3|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D!|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 4@H is a normal game; it can't make, happens|pg||
nt|ady: n/s might get to a tricky 3NT|pg||
nt|jcwla: My kind of trump layout.  Oh well maybe 3NT.|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|ady: 2@H forcing?|pg||
nt|oleberg: No, invitational|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Invitational I think as they play weak jump shifts|pg||
nt|oleberg: They open light on unbalanced hands|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: strong invitation|pg||
nt|oleberg: 11S confimed an unbalanced hand|pg||
nt|oleberg: 1@S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But David, openings can be 9-10 counts in their methods|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Ah, I see - 12 againt 12 is not enough for game, that requires 26...|pg||
nt|ady: stayed out of trouble    but 3NT might have slipped through|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s9|pc|sA|pc|sK|pg||
nt|oleberg: 1@D is always balanced, anothe reliable source tells me. And he is right of course|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I would be ashamed NOT bidding this 4 @H|pg||
nt|oleberg: Always unbalanced, was what I meant|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ady: would 3@H from north have been forcing  or a stronger invitation?|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hJ|pc|h6|pg||
nt|oleberg: Forcing|pg||
nt|Walddk2: After this match they will break for dinner. Restart at 19.30 local time, in 2 hours and 10 minutes|pg||
nt|oleberg: Normal treatment in Denmark|pg||
nt|ady: ok|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Makes sense when a jump to 2@H over 1@D shows a weak hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Then 1@H followed by 2@H becomes invitational, and followed by 3@H game-forcing|pg||
nt|jcwla: Do they open a lot of junk?  For this to be inv'l.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: yes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 9-10 counts frequently as I said before|pg||

mc|9|nt|ady: difficult to bid the north hand with either Q@C  or K@S less   would that have been a  weak jump shift  first round?|pg||

pc|sJ|nt|Walddk2: But seriously, she thought she could defest 5@H|pg||

nt|oleberg: They might be in a forcing sequence, bidding game vul. vs not.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This is 850 - 5 @S D only 800|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bjarnarson must think hearts are 5-0|pg||
nt|oleberg: Or she might have thought they were|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Oh - 500|pg||
nt|ady: and 5@H  undoubled  better still|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Is South in the room? Tell him, that East can NOT overruff...|pg||
nt|ady: n/s do have a mircacle fit   but does everyone like 4@H \/|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Another area that needs further discussion. Whether 4@S on this auction establishes a force when followed by a pass. To me 100% not|pg||
nt|jcwla: "Like" not the first word that comes to mind.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: People tend to see forcing pass ghosts all over the place|pg||

pc|c8|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Here I think one should play the first trick immediately - because the situation is quite different, whether South plays the @S Ace og NOT!|pg||

mb|2S!|nt|hawe45:  But the greatest og slams it is|pg||
nt|ady: minor suit position great for e/w|pg||
nt|jni33:  Snorri Sveinsson - Skafti Jonsson made the slam against Peter Lund and Steen Møller|pg||
nt|ady: 2@S  again invitational?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think so|pg||
nt|jni33: Grethe Hecht and Margrethe Rykow went one down against  Nadia Bekkouche - Trine Binderkrantz|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's not worth more opposite at least nine cards in the minors, is it?|pg||

nt|Walddk2: I don't think Rasmussen has described her hand very well until now|pg||
nt|oleberg: I dont like 2@S. AK,A is to powerfull. 2@S might be bid on a solid suit and a side king|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Agree - I hate it, but...|pg||
nt|oleberg: Remember that EW doesn't open 9 and 10 counts|pg||
nt|oleberg: I meant semi solid. Like KQJxxx|pg||

nt|Walddk2: One declarer went down, remember|pg||
nt|oleberg: It seems difficult to figure the winning line out|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ady: probably played a 2nd spade which got ruffed|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This should only make double-dummy|pg||
nt|oleberg: A natural lead. unfortunately for the defence, it removes declarers option of playing on spades|pg||
nt|oleberg: I still think it will be down, but it is probably the best lead for declarer.|pg||
nt|jni33: I would have preferred a @d lead if I had been declarer |pg||
nt|hawe45:  To makee, you need @D and ! by North as they actually are|pg||

nt|hawe45:  WhatÂ´s wrong with 4 @S (N/S)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: not much - only two down|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I think so|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|jni33: what about DBL instead of 2@h?|pg||
nt|oleberg: Not that it matter a lot, but South's pass might contain up to 9 hcp, with distribution unsuitable for a bid.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: One can be rather weak for a balancing double, so partner should not punish you by bidding too high|pg||
nt|oleberg: Balanced hands with 2 spades, for instance|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A free 2@H shows values|pg||
pc|s4|nt|oleberg: I like double instead of 2@H|pg||
nt|jni33: but DBL shows @c too ?|pg||
nt|ady: may now only make 10 tricks|pg||
nt|oleberg: Partner should be absolutely free to double on three hearts|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Ed Shapiro says that West also had the option of bidding 3@H at her first turn. I like that better than double|pg||
nt|oleberg: And it might be important to know whether you have 7 or 8 hearts|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|pc|hA|pc|d8|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That would also protect @SK|pg||
