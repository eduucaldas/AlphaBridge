nt|Walddk2: Hamar is located on the shores of lake Mjøsa, Norway's largest lake, and is the principal city of Hedmark county. Vikingskipet (the Viking Ship) became world famous for hosting the ...|pg||

nt|h_karluk: too many rules, 15, 19, 20 imho experts good at that|pg||
nt|baardolav: Simonsen have to get rid of the D ace now... to avoid endplay|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d8|pc|dQ|pc|d3|pg||

mb|2D|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: speaking of my own "Time to think about their alternatives are clear or not" |pg||
nt|baardolav: 6spade is on here for EW|pg||
nt|h_karluk: a very light opening at 1st seat|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not a great slam and certainly not if played by East|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i guess pass pass and 2@c or 2N (depends their CC) would better|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: What's wrong with a weak 2, Hamdi?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You are NV against V|pg||
nt|chick: how can W find out what he needs to know for a slam?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 1st seat, i do not like to deceive my nonpassed partner|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: If opener is allowed to bid his suit, you have lost the advantage of opening a Multi 2@D|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i may not find 21 at all times|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|pc|h6|pc|h8|pg||

nt|h_karluk: i only see a spade tenace there, side suits bleak|pg||
mc|12|nt|h_karluk: however my review, my opinion|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@C maximum unspecified major (3@D asks which and you bid the major you don't have). 3@D weak with hearts, 3@H weak with spades|pg||
nt|sybarra: most use 3 @C/3@d to show hts and sp max (I thought) |pg||
nt|sybarra: that is more interesting Roland |pg||
pg||

nt|sybarra: yes I can see |pg||
nt|baardolav: I use that setup, and then you also can show AKQxxx too|pg||
nt|baardolav: in both suits before 3nt|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: i forgot, long years passed, i think we were playing multi including 4441 good, so 3 level bids over 2N were really impressive|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|baardolav: 4441 is not common any more|pg||
pc|h4|nt|h_karluk: sure, in the states i didn't see any multi fan here (district 7)|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h8|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|chick: that's because the ACBL (in its infinite wisdom) has made multi a restricted convention|pg||
nt|sybarra: in the states, Hamdi,  multi is not permitted |pg||
pc|sK|nt|baardolav: to open in multi :)|pg||

nt|Walddk2: You'll get 8 years in the district jail in Raleigh if you try to open a Multi|pg||
nt|baardolav: strange lead... try to find partner when he have all the HCP missing|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|pc|sT|pc|s8|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cT|pc|cK|pc|c7|pg||
nt|santyclz: Multi is considered a "gateway" convention, leading to things like "forcing pass."|pg||
mc|10|nt|h_karluk: however, i think 2@d Multi allowed in higher level, i m qualified for GNT, after Morgentown (sorry if misspelled) who knows|pg||

nt|baardolav: 2nt makes with a natural h lead... 3 goes down... for sure... a lot down... because he have to make the spadefiness early|pg||

nt|h_karluk: <double dummy> underleading from @d A even 2N would put declarer into enough pressure, that's why i said "This can make 2N but it can also go down"|pg||

nt|h_karluk: that's cool|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c5|pc|c9|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's a lucky 3NT. 6 tricks in the minors and two aces. Then you can endplay East to give you an extra trick in a major|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|pc|cJ|pc|c3|pg||
