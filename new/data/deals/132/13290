nt|mdgraham: Good morning all|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Good morning|pg||
mb|5C|nt|sharkey: looks like EW can make 4@S...|pg||
nt|cuttysark: An exciting board to start|pg||
mb|5H|nt|sharkey: W has a problem now - 3@C may have been better than x|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I am quite impressed with the 1@H overcall - don;t think I would bid such a bad suit in the sandwich position|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  Hello, Liz. Hi to all.|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d3|nt|cuttysark: A fast auction to the normal spot: South rebids her spades to show at least 5, North denies support|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ady: negative diamond lead looks best|pg||
nt|vugraphzxs: Good morning|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Indeed - seems to attack communications and wait for tricks in the other suits|pg||
nt|garnetts: Good morning all |pg||
nt|ady: good morning David|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Spades lie quite well for declarer, who will probably look for tricks there|pg||
nt|cuttysark: (and good morning, Louis and Davids)|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Swift auction to the gran slam -|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Looks like 2 down, a small save against 400|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sharkey: View N has @SK) the spots are good enuff to pull trumps|pg||
nt|sharkey: @SK9|pg||
nt|jcwla: Looks like 4NT is the ask, 5@S shows two with the @CQ, 5NT shows the presence of all key cards, and 7@C is made with the side source of tricks.|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mdgraham: agree. A 1@S overcall is an attractive possibility, as that is the suit you would like partner to lead|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ady: seems only realistic play is QX spades with east|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|cuttysark: She is unlucky in her finesses|pg||
nt|jcwla: 15 tricks at notrump, but at IMPs the most important thing is to get to the grand.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Indeed, if all the aces are present it is hard to imagaine a hand with no play for the Grand|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ady: diaond continuation seems best|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hA|pc|h6|pc|d6|pg||
nt|cuttysark: But 5@S may be more expensive if they find the heart ruffs, so she has done well|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|garnetts: this works quite well |pg||
pc|hK|pc|c5|nt|ady: best now to cash diamonds and king and another spade|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sharkey: natural @S trick...|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sA|nt|cuttysark: Communication very difficult - it would be so much easier if her clubs were like dumy's spades|pg||
nt|garnetts: cashing diamonds and hearts priot to exiting with the last heart is as good as anything|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I think I would prefer a takeout double|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s9|nt|ady: all sees to lead to down 1|pg||
pc|s6|nt|sharkey: ruff @C @SQ and @D finesse...|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|c2|nt|garnetts: they do but what else can you do apart from stopping in a partscore |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  Hello Mike. Can only add, that if they could have a method to show both majors in this position...|pg||
pc|s7|pc|c6|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Hoping for the doubleton queen - not much else to play for, as you said at the start|pg||
pc|s5|pc|c8|pc|sT|pc|c7|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|cJ|pc|d4|pc|c9|pg||

nt|sharkey: 1 NT by E - may be final contract?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Maybe after minors it is not so clear - 2@D Michaels?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Anyway, she has reduced the lead by 3 imps|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|garnetts: true but there was a more obvious end play |pg||
nt|ady: 4@S an excellent game for e/w|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sharkey: dont think NS will enter into the fray VUL|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: not enamoured with the 2@C overcall prefer 1NT |pg||
nt|cuttysark: Looking at the NS hands, 4@H is pretty good - sinks on the 4-1 break|pg||
nt|ady: even with spade king offside can make if getting diamond position right|pg||
nt|garnetts: 4@H is unlucky to fail |pg||
mb|1N|nt|sharkey: S thinks otherwise|pg||
nt|cuttysark: When I was commentating yeserday there were a lot of slams - here we go again|pg||
nt|mdgraham: The trick here is to avoid the 7-level|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  Players are getting more and more aggressive entering against strong 1N openers|pg||
mb|2C|nt|cuttysark: Now West needs to set up a game-forcing auction, set hearts as trump, and find out that partner has the right controls|pg||
mb|2D|nt|jcwla: Nice 4@S bid here to help them avoid getting too high with W not holding any @S's.|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: well well !!!!!!!!!!|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 3@H is a Fit Jump - shows clubs as well as hearts|pg||
nt|sharkey: View S and E totally combine for 30 HCP+ S is lucky to catch this good a dummy|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Important to discuss the difference between 3@S and 4@S after a 2-level response|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|cuttysark: In Acol she could make a strong jump shift to 2@S, then bid 4@H to showthis hand|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South raising to 3@D would make things awkward - now West can cue-bid 3@D|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|ady: west came in late    will be pleased with dummy|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: When opponents have a double fit.... so do you|pg||
mb|4N|nt|henryb:  I am not sure it is wise. On this hand South will make 110, but she would have made 100 on defense|pg||
mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Asking about spades she will find that the queen is missing and avoid the Grand...|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: And, having bid all 5 denominations, she finally reveals her heart support at the 6-level!|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mdgraham: well, AK10x is adequate support|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dQ|nt|garnetts: I acnnot believe that she played a club--will south be able to read it |pg||
nt|ady: down now with diamond played|pg||
nt|garnetts: South will think she has six spades maybe--|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Norths diamond lead must be a singleton |pg||
nt|cuttysark: (Easy for me to see, I guess, but why else lead dummy's suit?|pg||
nt|jcwla: I would take 3@S as setting trump and asking for control bidding.  A jump to game seems more of this type of hand: nothing but @S's but an opener rather than a preempt.|pg||

nt|cuttysark: If you put your mouse over the Closed Room contract you see their auction|pg||
mb|1D|nt|sharkey: Well, Reess team need IMPs so have to do something.  So far this worked out|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Flat board. Auction at the other table did not really address the spade issue, it seems.   |pg||
nt|cuttysark: QUite similar  but over 1NT West could bis a forcing 3@H|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|sharkey: Misfits coing up...|pg||
nt|jcwla: Rebid 2@H or 2@S here?|pg||
mb|2S|mb|3C|nt|cuttysark: Another brave bid, from South this time|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: 5th highest lead clarifies the count in diamonds for everyone|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I prefer 2@H because that may be where we want to play - I would need better spades for 2@S|pg||
nt|jcwla: Yeah, the @S's look like five, don't they?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: some might have competed with 2@S with east hand   vulnerability may have beeb influential|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sfoxa:  yes, S can hope to find at least 1 fit|pg||
pc|c5|nt|cuttysark: I wonder what that double means - if penalty it is a big view|pg||
pc|c9|nt|sharkey: EW can make 5@D I think; have to work on @S suit - not @H.  3 NT easier....|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Hi all|pg||
nt|henryb:  E-W can make game, but only game in either red suit. I agree with Canonne that West is worth a reverse, but it may be hard to keep Clement from overreaching to slam|pg||
nt|sharkey: hi Hamdi|pg||
nt|sharkey: W forced to bid 3 NT now?|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|garnetts: a bit of a coffee hand now---maybe a lot of players would double 2@H with the East hand--I would have risked 2@S |pg||
nt|cuttysark: A low club lead and a couple of heart ruffs would have been an exciting defence|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cJ|nt|sharkey: After West's reverse 3@S must be forcing....|pg||
nt|sharkey: sry - East's 3@S|pg||
nt|henryb:  Clement obviously thought 3@s was forcing. Canonne thought she had done enough opposite a misfit|pg||
nt|sharkey: this may not make either....|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c6|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s4|pc|s2|pc|sK|pg||
nt|cuttysark: But even this useful looking spade position is not enough for declarer - cannot ruff 2 diamonds without establishing East's @S8|pg||
pc|dA|nt|jcwla: A common adage is not to double partscores into games at IMPs unless expecting a two-trick set - hard to see how E could have that level of confidence.|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dT|pc|d2|pg||
nt|henryb:  I agree with Canonne, and think that Clement should make a more positive noise over 3@h|pg||
pc|dK|nt|sharkey: @C and more @C will doom declarer|pg||
pc|d3|pc|h2|pc|d5|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Clear to compete in 4th seat - not so clear in the middle of a live auction when South could still be very strong|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d8|pc|s7|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s3|pc|sA|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|henryb:  she after all has three diamonds for her partner's six card suit and @hAx for the five card suit|pg||
nt|h_karluk: there are two forms of reverse, normal and high, counting eleven in red suits with a minimum that's not close any of that. 2@d could be more reasonable rebid.|pg||
pc|d7|nt|jcwla: The one thing you don't want to do on a board such as this is bring back -470.|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|sT|pc|h8|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h9|pc|h7|nt|sharkey: perhaps better open 1@H instead to avoid rebid problem|pg||

nt|szalay: I like to bid more with 74|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: but QJ in @S is a negative factor|pg||

nt|cuttysark: I guess there may be more action at the other table...|pg||
nt|ady: e/w should end in 4@H|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think that one should open 1@d, and that partner should make allowances for a high card stretch when opener shows 5-6|pg||
nt|sharkey: Levy lucky in CR - need @S lead to set this|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it could have been worse - NS might have been in hearts on the 6-2 fit |pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: set 4@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: 1@D-1@H-1@S-2@C (forcing)-2@D -- now E may take over and get them to the @D slam.  @H's also possible but less likely.|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  actually, if QJ @d would have been third...|pg||
mb|1C|nt|h_karluk: 24/16 and interesting score on CR. Wait a minute please, Arent there 2x2 losers on M suits please?|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: And EW could make 2@C|pg||
mb|1S|nt|garnetts: This hand is everyones 4@H contract--a spread too|pg||
nt|sharkey: on Bd 2 where S ventured 2@S EW played 1 NT down 2 in CR; thus no gain from daring 2@S overcall|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: play should be quick|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 2NT opener - possibly upgraded to 20 because of the good suit - makes it very easy to reach the easy game|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I am told they are playing in 3@S in the other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: West may decide to show her doubleton heart now|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|sharkey: East on lead - @S lead not too attarctive...|pg||
nt|henryb:  At the other table East chpse to lead a club against 4@h and one of the spade losers was quickly thrown away|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|nt|sharkey: Some may have raised on West's cards to ensure @S lead....|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Looks like an accurate stop - provided the defenders cash their clubs there are 5 losers|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ady: defenders will need to cash their 2 diamond tricks when in with A@H  or there will be an overtrick|pg||
pc|s2|nt|cuttysark: Or not :)|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s8|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|h_karluk: Say you stop in 3@h and your opps find killing @s lead, then you proud of yourself and smile about nice stop. However, once you reached the fat that impossible 4 made then you ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: think that's not fair. Sometimes good bidding punished while bad bidding rewarded|pg||
nt|jcwla: I like the 3@S -- knows they have a safe home in @D's and E may (and did) really want to hear about the @S card there.|pg||

nt|h_karluk: *fact|pg||

nt|jcwla: dividends.|pg||

mb|4H|mb|4S|nt|mdgraham: 4@h transfer to 4@S|pg||

mb|5D|nt|garnetts: 3@C?  |pg||
nt|ady: if east competes n/s will surely go to 3@S|pg||

mb|p|mb|5S|nt|cuttysark: best to support partner at the 6-level when there is a slam on|pg||

nt|ady: this comes home with diamond finesse right|pg||
nt|jcwla: I wonder whether 3@H is invitational or forcing.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: The jump to 3@H is unusual nowadays - many play 2@H as forcing and 3@H as a splinter|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East now has a problem that she didn't want|pg||
mb|6S|nt|cuttysark: Indeed - when partner doubles at her second shot there is a reason why she did not double first time - hand is flawed|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  If she guesses right to go up and continue the suit she will have good defensive chances|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: "The 5-level belongs to the opposition" - or was that "When in doubt, bid one more?"|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: 3C and 2 M losers for EW|pg||
nt|sharkey: West's 4@C opening VUL CR not my first choice....|pg||
nt|jcwla: 2@S very reasonable at red on white; Zia likes to have side queen-doubletons because "they never play the preemptor for them."|pg||
mb|1H|nt|garnetts: modern game suggests a double is right here|pg||
nt|garnetts: if partner bids 2@C will likely have five |pg||

mb|3C|nt|garnetts: if she had 3 clubs when a low one was led ducking was right --cannot remember if she had 2 or 3 |pg||
mb|3D|nt|mdgraham: one of those exciting things - if West had opened 1@D, NS would not have bid to 3NT |pg||
nt|cuttysark: 5@C is beaten y leading 3 rounds of diamonds, and so promoting a trump trick.|pg||
mb|3S|nt|garnetts: if partner has A@C then fine if not then she has the K@D |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: You can look it up - go to Movie and click on the result|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  in 5@c, W leads @d triple and promotes @c Q |pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Looks a normal 2@H - she has enough to keep the bidding open in case partner is quite strong|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: over D 2H F/NF , that's the question |pg||
nt|henryb:  I too would bid 2@c, but E-W had an ENORMOUS number coming on defense|pg||
nt|jcwla: W's 2@S rebid should show this type of hand and these extras.|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Tough problem for West now|pg||
nt|cuttysark: One of my 'things' is that if you want to open light in 3rd seat you should have a good suit, one you want partner to lead|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mdgraham: very sensible|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sharkey: I play it NF - Forcing on 1 level only|pg||

pc|sK|pc|s4|nt|ady: seems like 3NT some sort of relay?|pg||
nt|garnetts: she had 3 so ducking was best --Thanks Liz|pg||
nt|jcwla: W has an awfully good hand even in context but gives partner some leeway and another really nice auction by E/W.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I guess 5@C is not too bad a contract, but the singleton ace would be better if it were the ace of hearts|pg||
pc|s5|nt|cuttysark: East-West have realised that they have two club losers, and stopped safely in game|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Could 3NT be the dreaded Serious Slam Try?|pg||
nt|sharkey: many play 2@H after 1@S - Dbl - 2@H shows good @S raise|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so that might help to avoid minor suit competition|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|pc|cK|pc|c9|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cQ|pc|c4|nt|henryb:  I think the modern approach is to play forcing at the one level and transfers at the two level. This sacrifices the natural 2@c response but gaains lead directing raises and the distinction between constructive and weak raises of opener's suit|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|nt|sharkey: West elected to bid 2@C after pd's Rdbl,  Normally bidding after pd's Rdbl shows a weak opener|pg||

nt|cuttysark: North now committed to slam, hoping there are not 2 spade losers|pg||

pc|s6|pc|d8|nt|cuttysark: Maybe we should unblock @HK before ducking the diamond|pg||

nt|cuttysark: But all wil be well|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  so 2@h looks better, but it's definitely matter of style|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Reess team gaining a number of small swings |pg||

nt|ady: 3NT   better as 5@C  might go down if 10@S was with east and a spade led|pg||
nt|sharkey: 10 tricks - next....|pg||
nt|sharkey: or may be only 9|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|cuttysark: South could bid 3NT now to show a half stopper: with a real stopper she would bid 3NT last time|pg||
nt|ady: not sure what 3@S shows?|pg||
nt|jcwla: With the nice fits 4@H makes in comfort while 5@C goes down just one.|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: East has taken partner very seriously - I presume 2@C must show at least invitational values|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  seems so|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes. Hard to see why East doubled 3@C otherwise.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I am surprised South did not double with her club support and 2 aces|pg||
mb|4C|nt|cuttysark: Doubt, I guess :)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  afraid of 4@h?|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|garnetts: good point Liz---I imagine 3@S is alittle like fifth suit forcing |pg||
nt|garnetts: not sure what to do|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: I guess this can be made - but it does require a few good views|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|cK|nt|garnetts: well done |pg||
nt|ady: seemed to have reached a reasonable spot|pg||
nt|mdgraham: maybe I will be in a minority, but personally I think 1NT-all pass is just fine|pg||
nt|mdgraham: still, if 1NT is 16-18 West might pursue a game if there is a major suit fit|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  it's definitely better than 3NT, but W has to demonstrate magician skills to prevail|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c9|nt|garnetts: it is an effective  sequence |pg||
nt|ady: no spade lead an easy ride|pg||
nt|garnetts: claim time after this trick |pg||
nt|ady: must say the pace of the game for this event has been very good|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Noticeable that the French players do not slow down the game - a pleasure to watch|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|mdgraham: opposite a 15-17 strong NT, dubious|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Hugh Kelsey had a theory that partner would ahve a 4card major more than half the time, so it was worht using Stayman to improve the partscore|pg||
nt|cuttysark: But that only works when Stayman can be weak|pg||
nt|mdgraham: hmm 4333 and 4432 hands will surely have majors half the time and minors half the time?  |pg||
pc|h3|nt|cuttysark: East is thinking about her defence now - but there will be no post mortem between deals|pg||
nt|garnetts: The sequence is interesting because it would seem that 3@C showed real support and denied foru spades or South would have tried for game there |pg||
pc|h2|pc|hT|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c3|nt|h_karluk: as M leads barred, maybe @c J would be better to start, how about in same layout N has @c T..wow|pg||
pc|c5|nt|sfoxa:  sometimes even 4-3 major is played better that 1NT on 18-20 points|pg||
nt|cuttysark: He had some mathematical proof - but it rarely seems to work at the table :)|pg||
pc|h4|pg||

mb|p|nt|sharkey: I think 2 NT describes her hand very well|pg||
mb|2H|nt|cuttysark: I am trying to construct a sequence to slam! West needs to show a game-forcing 3card raise now|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: it is true that 6@C relies upon club position on this hand but it would not if West hand another spade--so when a slam is at worse 50% you should be i n it|pg||
nt|sharkey: Struggle to make this|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ok w had bal 11, how abt opener, bal/unbal, limit/reverse values? so i recommend 1D for W|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 2@D to play in partner's major|pg||
mb|3H|nt|cuttysark: 2NT an attemtp to compete in the minors|pg||
nt|jcwla: W did not raise initially (some would have) but now does not sell out, showing both minors with longer @C's with 2NT.  Now N has a dilemma with a flat hand.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: I wonder if 3@H is forcing in their methods - after all, they could show a 3card limit raise without mentioning spades|pg||
nt|cuttysark: West cannot go past 5@H because she has no diamond control|pg||
nt|ady: tht that was the n/s method   e/w the same?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Perhaps East is worth a jump to 3@C at her second term - the spade bid has improved her hand|pg||
nt|garnetts: I meant 6@H not 6@C |pg||
nt|cuttysark: (Term=turn)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|cuttysark: Presure again - shee needs to guess clubs to make this if they switch to spades|pg||

nt|h_karluk: i am just curious to get an answer about opener's rebid, 1D gives him a good chance to describe well rebid|pg||

nt|h_karluk: if uncontested easy, if competitive still X|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 2N still in the box sir :)|pg||
nt|cuttysark: You need to find the 5card major - they must be using oredinary Stayman|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Or even ordinary|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|ady: part score hand    e/w can make 9 or 10 tricks in clubs|pg||
nt|garnetts: interesting choice of bids for East |pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|sharkey: pros and cons for most conventions. you assumption you want the 11-12 HCP hand to take charge - by bidding 2 NT you let the other hand decide|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: I prefer 1@S to 2@C --hate two level with only five cards |pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: I hate to overcall a minor when I have a good 4-card major, so I am afraid I would double and hope partner did not bid diamonds|pg||
nt|garnetts: Double also an option |pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Or indeed, bid 1@S as you suggest, David |pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: I don't think our suggestions would get us any higher than the actual overcall :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: 4@S actually has real chances |pg||
pc|s4|nt|h_karluk: while minimum 23 is at our side why i am supposed to be in a hurry ?:)|pg||
nt|jcwla: Many want both extras and five clubs for 3@C so S settles for the 2@S rebid and hears the @D control she wanted.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Another slam - though the heart break makes this one 'interesting'|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Good lead|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  good decision by W - after such bidding, @s could be the weakest point of NS|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  anyway, it attacks communications|pg||
nt|cuttysark: It is nromally right to lead the major after a 1M response - or dummy's second suit, but that is not tempting from Ax|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  agree with non-@c lead|pg||
nt|cuttysark: One thing sure - South has diamonds well covered|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East knows South has two cards higher than the four, so may well return @S10 after the ace|pg||
pc|s8|nt|jcwla: Looks like a 0314 response and S will likely next ask for the @SQ with 5@D.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mdgraham: (Rule of Eleven)|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|cuttysark: But when you bid a Moysian 4-3 they often break 5-1 or 6-0 - too much to handle :)|pg||
pc|sT|nt|sfoxa:  9 imps for reess in board  13 - passed 1NT next door|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 'Normal' to return 4th highest, but here imprtoant not to make it easy for declarer to duck |pg||
nt|cuttysark: Still needs to regain the lead if South takes @SK now|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|nt|cuttysark: Now she can discard one heart and ruff the other and make her contract|pg||
nt|garnetts: even a 4-2 break has chances here |pg||
nt|h_karluk: say there's a competitive auction then our side has numerous advantages|pg||

nt|h_karluk: say there's not then ou side kept economy of space sir:)|pg||
nt|sharkey: 4@S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: going for diamonds |pg||
pc|s2|nt|garnetts: that is possible--haven't analysed it too closely--just looked as though it was not much wors that 4@C |pg||
nt|jcwla: With the hidden extras and only the @SQ missing among key cards, S takes a shot at slam - now to make it.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: With @SQ North would either bid 6@S, or cuebid a spare king - or even bid 5NT|pg||
pc|s9|pc|hT|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|hJ|pc|s6|nt|ady: if you play a diamond to establish a discard  another trump can be played and a 3rd trump when losing a heart|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Yes - you would play the heart first in case the hand with @DA had only 2 spades, but it doesn't work on this layout|pg||
nt|ady: yes    strange the even 3-3 spade break not good in this case|pg||
