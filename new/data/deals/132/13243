mb|p|nt|jni33: nice to have a so sound take-out dbl after 6@c - pass - pass :)|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1D|nt|oleberg: West is a very strong player, but also very solid.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Next slam|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|oleberg: It is like Rolanf said: It is not a guess|pg||
nt|mr murray: he will talk about that hand long after the sun goes down. :)|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|4C|nt|Walddk2: The slam is 40%, so below par|pg||
nt|mr murray: he wishes he took roland adviseand passed and then never stopped bidding |pg||
nt|jni33: Board 17: We only have one result so far ... W 6@c made 12|pg||
nt|vugraph814: 6@d?|pg||
nt|jni33: sr it was 6@d|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6@D yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Don't you need diamonds 2-2?|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I'd rather be in 6@D than 4NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And Larsen has a solid suit|pg||
nt|oleberg: A little hard to lead the @CK, the potential thrumph suit for a slam|pg||
nt|mr murray: guess straight flushes dont count in bridge like they do in poker.|pg||
pc|hT|nt|Walddk2: @CK won't defeat 4NT|pg||
nt|oleberg: Only as excuses for bidding :)|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h3|pc|hA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But was it necessary to bid 3NT so fast?|pg||
nt|mr murray: as soon as he plays diamonds he will claim.|pg||

nt|peachy: surprise play, to me|pg||

pc|dJ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|mr murray: my bid would have been 2n/t if forcing leaving room for partner to bid 4 spades if he wants. 3n/t says this is it.|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|s6|nt|oleberg: Still difficult to judge such things|pg||
pc|h6|pc|c5|pg||
nt|oleberg: The @HJ in East would make 3NT superior.|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s7|nt|mr murray: maybe 2n/t not forcing. If that the case 3n/t is probably right|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Well, the queen is some  kind of fit opposite 6+ cards|pg||

nt|oleberg: It is likely, that 2@S only showed 5|pg||
mb|1H|mb|2D|mb|d|nt|mr murray: key was if 2n/t was forcing after 2/1 in clubs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If it doesn't show 6, your rebid is wrong in normal methods|pg||
nt|oleberg: Tell that to Lars :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: He wrote that himself in 1991|pg||
nt|peachy: in 2/1, if thats what they play, matter of style. My style is that it doesnt show six|pg||
nt|mr murray: dont have their system in front of me. Does anyone know?|pg||
pc|d4|nt|oleberg: They are not a regular partnership|pg||
nt|mr murray: my style is that it always shows 6|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|pc|d5|pg||
nt|oleberg: But it is quite common in Denmark, that people who play 12-14 NT's, only shows 5 spades here.|pg||
nt|mr murray: if 2/1 = game force no need to distort distribution with minny or maxi hands|pg||
nt|vugraph814: they play 15-17nt's|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They would solve the problem if they open 1NT|pg||
nt|peachy: matter of style, in my preferred style 2NT shows both unbids stopped|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Then 5332 is out of the question when you rebid 2@S|pg||
nt|oleberg: Then I'm almost certain it showed 6|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|pc|h5|pc|h9|pg||

nt|mr murray: if it showed 6 then Larsen should definitely find a bid to allow him more leeway to bid 4 spades|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2S!|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|peachy: this NT bid could drive them to wrong slam|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is bad news for Bilde. Now she knows partner has a stiff heart|pg||
mb|3C|nt|peachy: Roland, I must have missed inference. How?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So she needs very good clubs opposite for slam to be worth bidding|pg||
nt|oleberg: She will drive it to slam. Partner only needs AK of clubs, for the slam to be reasonable|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Did she not show 5-4 in the minors and a spade stopper?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What can that spade stopper be when you look at the South cards?|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Qxx|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|peachy: that inference available if dioamonds always longer in this auction|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No-one would bid 2@C with 4-4 I hope|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|s2|nt|mr murray: I think she should have gone after 4th suit and raise|pg||
nt|mr murray: she has so many controls|pg||
nt|mr murray: more rhan she needed for her auctionj|pg||
nt|jni33: 1@d is always unbalanced |pg||
nt|Walddk2: GIve me one hand that would open 1@D with four and rebid 2@C with four|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They don't exist|pg||

nt|jni33: I dont know the bidding at the other table ... sorry|pg||

nt|jni33: there might have been some implications?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|2C|nt|Walddk2: Could be but EW are V against NV|pg||
nt|mr murray: cant see a good reason to guess trump suit correctly|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The overcall here does not give a clue|pg||
nt|oleberg: Or maybe a diamond lead making the @DJ and @DQ appear in trick 1, giving away the distribution|pg||
mb|2N|mb|4C|mb|4D|nt|jni33: and for certain E does not lead a single @s :)|pg||
nt|oleberg: Or maybe a thrumph lead|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cA|nt|oleberg: Everything seems far-fetched|pg||
nt|vugraph814: just kidding|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, can happen to the best. Thomas Bessis led a singleton trump yesterday against a slam|pg||
nt|oleberg: Maybe they felt they needed a swing|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c8|pc|c9|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And sure enough, he found partner with Qxx|pg||
pc|c5|nt|mr murray: singleton trump leads only work sometimes. Not very often. When they are only lead to beat contract it is wonderful.|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: He only had 12 hcp and you need 13 to open|pg||
mb|1H|mb|1N|mb|2D!|nt|oleberg: Probably shows a sound raise|pg||
nt|mr murray: his shpe was bad also. zero cards in majors. 10-3-0-0 distro also poor.|pg||
nt|mr murray: :)|pg||
nt|jni33: Board 23 has been played twice. Both other Tables played 2@h in West .. one won 6 tricks and one won 7 tricks|pg||
nt|mr murray: he will talk about that hand until the cows come home which is never |pg||
nt|oleberg: Bilde will act, either now, or when it comes back|pg||
mb|d|mb|r|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|d|nt|oleberg: Fine redouble, at least if it doesn't create a force. But it shouldn't.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|oleberg: redouble probably suggests partner competes|pg||
mb|p|nt|oleberg: But he has already bid his hand. And then some.|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Did South not also do that with her first double?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: She has overbid twice in my opinion|pg||
nt|oleberg: Maybe the first double simply showed strength|pg||
pc|h2|nt|Walddk2: Yes, and then what more does she have to add?|pg||
nt|jni33: Lone explains both doubles as Take-out|pg||
pc|h7|nt|Walddk2: She is absolutely minimum for her first double|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|mr murray: good pull. Leaving partscore dbles in is bad for ones complextion. too many -670's floating around. This was easy with 5 card suit.|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|pc|dJ|nt|oleberg: And then maybe she thought that Lebensohl was on, North showing a good 3@D|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mr murray:  too many t/o dbl's are left in|pg||
nt|jni33: Lone did not alert 3@d ... at least I didnt see it and Mathias didnt |pg||
pc|c6|pc|d3|pc|dA|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hT|pc|h3|nt|peachy: sad ending for NS|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|jni33: and we usually see everything :)|pg||
nt|mr murray: Lars was pretty conservative. I would dbl with 3 almost sure tricks and partner opening the bidding|pg||
nt|oleberg: Well, it is "only" the foul lay in diamonds, that defeats the contract.|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|pc|cT|nt|oleberg: Not a good contract, but not that silly.|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|oleberg: Mild overbidding indeed.|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|jni33: and the foul lay in @d was first shown when Lars made the DBL .. and then it was too late|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d6|nt|peachy: I find South's mild overbidding understandable, they are red and pd overcalled 1NT|pg||
nt|oleberg: But still overbidding|pg||
nt|mr murray: going to pay a steep price this time|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe she was unlucky to find diamonds 4-1, but that is cancelled out by the fact that both heart honours were onside. So all in all they were not that unlucky|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|mr murray: very true|pg||
nt|jni33: then you win some and you loose some - and I have seen a lot of examples where NS bidding style worked the other way :)|pg||

nt|jni33: but a finesse in @d with the @d 6 might have been a solution .. but thats not for real ?|pg||

mb|d|nt|Walddk2: Peter now playing for the seniors|pg||

nt|Walddk2: No way East could have found a club lead|pg||
mb|d|nt|dburn: maybe, but if I were South I would not transfer here - why let the opponents see my distribution?|pg||
