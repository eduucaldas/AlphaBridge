nt|marlowepi: I suspect DeepFinesse could make 4S EW, but in practice 140 seems most likely in that denomination|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s3|nt|marlowepi: well, i think it is close at these colours|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|athene: deep finesse enjoys two-way queen guesses :) not to mention deep trump finesses|pg||
pc|dK|nt|peachy: Sort of lucky that West didn't balance, they would have ended in a biddable but unmakeable game|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|pc|d6|pg||

pc|h9|pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|athene: i think it's an interesting area of bidding theory what the optimal minimum is for a double of 1nt in 2nd and then in 4th chair - do you play ultra-sound in 2nd and then quite a ...|pg||
nt|athene: lot lighter after 1nt p p ?, or what?|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c4|pc|cK|pc|c5|pg||
nt|athene: say, 16+ in second and then 12+ in 4th|pg||
nt|athene: and does it change with the strength of the 1nt?|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|pc|s4|nt|marlowepi: N has to lead a D and S must switch to a heart i think|pg||
pc|h6|pg||

mb|2H!|an|spades|nt|roswolf: 2@D = SPADES AND ANOTHER I THINK|pg||

nt|ralfwil: 3nt has perhaps a chance, but not 4@s|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|garnetts: I agree Roland but with AQ stiff it is a reasonable bid as long as it cannot be passed |pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s play a standard 5 card major system i think - relatively uncommom in acol land|pg||

nt|garnetts: but he sin't  doing that |pg||
nt|garnetts: Must admit I cannot see much wrong with 1@H and if I had managed to bid 2@H --then 3@D wouldn't have been on my mind |pg||
nt|yo_yo: 2@H would be a 6 card suit with me|pg||
nt|blum1956: hi all|pg||
nt|ady: hi|pg||
nt|garnetts: In the balancing position here 2@H should be say a decent six card suit and a reasonable hand --what used to be called intermediate |pg||

pc|d8|nt|roswolf: oops|pg||
pc|d5|nt|Walddk2: This line is scary. It's not a good idea to shorten the long hand when you also have fit in a side suit|pg||
nt|garnetts: West should hold his cards up lol  |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nothing bad will happen here, but on a different layout ....|pg||

nt|yo_yo: (partially self - funded)|pg||
nt|lestergold: so is he considering the possibiolity that North has qx @c|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I think E is thinking about playing N with @cQx|pg||
nt|mwigor: if he has a complete count (i havent been watching then @hK @d9 is best|pg||
pc|s8|pc|c5|pc|sJ|nt|ady: west will get a count after north shows with 3 trumps   but with singleton Q@D cannot go wrong  in any event|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: 2nt is a scramble i assume, saying "i have 4333, you play the damn thing"|pg||

pc|cJ|pc|c3|pc|c2|pc|cQ|pg||

pc|h8|pc|hA|pc|h7|pc|h2|pg||
pc|c4|pc|s3|pc|cK|nt|marlowepi: i dont see why, exactly. N is top of range with a likely double spade stop. if S had enough to force to 3 level, i would want to be in game|pg||

pc|s4|nt|haans: bidding today make them go to 3 level|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Strange lead|pg||
nt|garnetts: Likely think that it is too balanced and the suit is too weak at red|pg||
nt|sybarra: and clubs are 3/3 |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|pelu: hi all|pg||

nt|ady: Q@C well place this will get home   also diamonds 4-4   |pg||
nt|garnetts: I think both NS judged well --one to pass as South and the other to upgrade the North hand---but the final decision to stay in 3NT is a poot one--South gave North a choice and 4@S ...|pg||
nt|garnetts: should have been bid |pg||
nt|yo_yo: easy make on  @C lead|pg||
nt|blum1956: Today more and more players open weak two with 6-card whatever quality one is|pg||

pc|h3|nt|lestergold: 3N is of course a normal and goo contract very unlucky that apart form spades all other 3  Qs badly placed for dclarer|pg||

nt|athene: 4-4-1-4 isn't that great when partner doubles 1@D, i don't think|pg||
nt|athene: having matching shortages means you have slow losers and nowhere to throw them|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I only see 3|pg||

pc|hT|pc|h7|pc|h8|pc|h5|pg||

pc|d7|pc|h9|pc|d4|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|athene: a 4-4 trump fit just isn't that many trumps if you start proceedings by drawing three rounds of them|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No, but @SQ could have been on. His line is not unreasonable|pg||
nt|peachy: the alternative was to let them score club ruff with the K|pg||
nt|marlowepi: depends on the tempo situation, which was bad here|pg||
nt|athene: i suppose Garvey could have had an opening bid for his opening bid - it has to happen sooner or later, surely? :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It doesn't happen often|pg||

pc|s6|pc|sQ|pc|sT|nt|marlowepi: he was in 3rd seat, seems a normal 1D to me...LTC right, playability in 3 seats, probably wants a D lead...not a thing of beauty red, but it also stops a strong club opening|pg||
mc|10|nt|Walddk2: As John Matheson points out, if @SQ is onside it is OK playing on clubs as he can then afford a ruff|pg||

pc|h8|nt|roswolf: but after the great lead the follow-up was disappointing|pg||

nt|athene: that was indeed an oversight|pg||

mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3D!|nt|Walddk2: At trick 8 when a low club was led off dummy he must rise with the ace|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|marlowepi: no reason not to that i can see, the suit is block. and S more or less telegraphed the spade situation|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: the 3@D bid suggests that south can't bid 3@H, natural and forcing, over 2@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: a bit of a contorted auction now|pg||
mb|p|pc|cK|nt|othered1: so I guess 4@H wouldn't have been a picture bid, either.|pg||
nt|athene: when you use 4th suit forcing to show a strong raise in partner's suit, it's easy for the message to get lost, because it can sound as though you just looked for a diamond stop and ...|pg||
nt|athene: then settled for the 4-3 heart fit|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not sure about that. this auction says S couldnt bid 3H because he wouldnt want to pass 4H if N bid it over 3H|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|pc|c8|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|pc|h2|nt|marlowepi: i dont think it is a very good use for that 4th suit auction to provide for bailing from 3N to 4H on a 43|pg||

pc|d7|nt|marlowepi: i think S did indeed have a way toi do that, and we saw it|pg||

nt|sybarra: or maybe 4441 |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nah|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He would never double with that hand|pg||
nt|othered1: Mightn't he think north may be thinking that south had something for the vulnerable opening bid, even 3rd hand?|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: The 470 was worth 8 IMPs, 110 at the other table|pg||
mb|3S|nt|garnetts: I like 1NT a lot more--because I hate double |pg||
nt|garnetts: If North doubles South might lead the K@H |pg||
nt|garnetts: Very well done by John here |pg||
nt|blum1956: was West's double of 1NT strong or 1-suiter? Probably strong|pg||
nt|blum1956: otherwise East shoud not pass by 2@c|pg||
nt|garnetts: I did not like the 2@D bid--why not just pass and leave it to partner?  Unless it showed a desire to play in 1NT xx|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i dont think you have to alert a penalty double of 1NT|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but other penalty doubles are now alertable|pg||
nt|garnetts: West double was penalty oriented I am fiarly sure |pg||
nt|garnetts: essential to have that option against 12-14 0r weaker |pg||
nt|blum1956: anyway EW are in serious trouble|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Looks like 3N doesn'thave much play at all on @H lead.|pg||

nt|blum1956: perfect lead!|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: only 2@D on 14 HCP???????????????|pg||

nt|lestergold: 50% i mean|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mcarroll: I agree, especially when you see where double leads to|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: The double may help NS here.  Why double when you are quite likely on lead?|pg||
nt|sybarra: S would love to have the ace to send it back |pg||
nt|Walddk2: I said it before and I will say it again. The EBU must require that all convention cards are submitted and then put on display on the website. It is unreasonable that commentators ...|pg||

nt|othered1: Most don't get terribly deep into relay development|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It took me 5 minutes to download the comprehensive version of the EW CC|pg||

mb|1N|nt|haans: at last a penalty double bid as penalty taken as penalty|pg||
nt|garnetts: transfer weak twos --interesting |pg||
nt|blum1956: looks like for EW more hands are suitable for a weak two|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@H   NF|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not a pretty fit|pg||
mb|2S|nt|Walddk2: Patterson could also have rebid 2@S which is also non-forcing|pg||
nt|sybarra: an understatement Roland |pg||
nt|othered1: Possible for NS also to  play @H, if EW decide not to enter the auction.  But that's not the modern approach|pg||
nt|roswolf: this sort of hand shows the bow and arrow nature of these responses - remember opener is limited by his failure to open 1@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: Tosh asking what hands Patterson wouldn't bid 2@h|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You know you are in trouble when the opponents start drawing trumps|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But down in 50's|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes indeed|pg||
nt|sybarra: we call it "only 50's"|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: Holland 3@C  for major|pg||

pc|h8|pc|hQ|nt|Walddk2: This is quite funny; an opener with no entry to his hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If this can be called an opener of course, but it is for them|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|garnetts: in my view it does |pg||
nt|blum1956: It is fair when there is some strong option covered by the same bid|pg||
nt|ady: 4-1 spade split no problem with clubs behaving|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Mrs Bakhshi thinks it's a multi |pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: Ah!  Yes, looking at the wrong part of the card :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: On baord six they missed 7@H because the 5@D bids was exclusion blackwood and they could not locate the Q@H it seems |pg||
nt|ady: could they not have bid 5NT  immediately rather than 5@D?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes 5NT  asks about top honours|pg||
nt|ady: or maybe he tht Q@H not needed with a 6 or 7 card suit headed by the ace|pg||
nt|garnetts: That is my view David---seems that neither South worked out the potential--in Both rooms North showed six hearts--what else is needed--maybe just knwledge of the ace of trumps--who ...|pg||
nt|garnetts: cares about the queen when you ten including the AK |pg||
nt|yo_yo: a former team mate to Cameron Small so it's doubly satisfying for her I guess :)|pg||
pc|d5|nt|Walddk2: David Bird must be a happy man today. His county, Hampshire, won the 20/20 trophy|pg||
nt|garnetts: Do not mention 20/20 after Somerste lost yesterday sensitive issue here--especially if Jane is watching |pg||
nt|garnetts: You will make her mad Roland|pg||

nt|athene: i believe 2@H might be a weak jump overcall in either major|pg||
nt|athene: anchor suits? we don't need no anchor suits! i ain't gotta show you no stinkin' anchor suit!|pg||
nt|athene: of course no-one watches black and white films these days but never mind|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hard decision on that hand on opening lead. as spades are shorter they should maybe get the nod, but dfar from clear. perhaps E went for the longer stronger suit because he wanted ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: to attack based on his partner's presumed trump length. but that strategy is not as advantageous against a 44 fit|pg||
nt|othered1: Surely NS have discussed counteractions to this|pg||
mb|3D!|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: yes, they play the Fred C. Dobbs convention|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|othered1: Why was 3@D alerted?|pg||

nt|Walddk2: What is going on here?|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|vugraphzda: Perhaps they play Leb here? |pg||
nt|athene: south thinks that 3@D is a transfer to hearts|pg||
nt|athene: north thinks it shows diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: this sort of thing is why E-W like playing their cunning bids :)|pg||
nt|othered1: but why  alert a natural, forcing bid?|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: They are obviously not on the same wavelength|pg||
nt|athene: ok, maybe they play transfers here so 3@D is a transfer to hearts which is staymanic i.e. showing four spades|pg||
nt|peachy: unfortunate mixup|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Allerton thinks partner has hearts and that 3@D was a transfer|pg||
nt|Walddk2: My guess|pg||
nt|othered1: Does north know what west showed?|pg||
nt|athene: i think if people are playing these against you you really have to discuss your bids over them|pg||
nt|athene: it's weird as NS are sometime-teammates of EW so they know all about this germ warfare|pg||
nt|marlowepi: novel concept, bill|pg||
nt|vugraphzda: Allerton sitting head in hands|pg||
nt|othered1: But if not alerted, n orth is allowed to forget.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it fell off?|pg||
nt|athene: what is novel? having some partnership agreements as to the meanings of bids?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They are playing with screens|pg||
nt|vugraphzda: perhaps with screens people are too happy to let their emotions show|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes:)|pg||
nt|peachy: I think they have screens, do they?|pg||
nt|othered1: Screen NW to SE?|pg||
nt|athene: well it makes for a more boring, but perhaps more successful, game|pg||
nt|vugraphzda: SW/NE|pg||
nt|marlowepi: soon will be playing with screams|pg||
nt|othered1: did east alert north?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: whom are you calling swine, Ant? :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzda: i.e. south aand west are screenmates|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Just like in bridge|pg||
nt|othered1: right, so it's up to east to alert north.|pg||
mb|6N|mb|p|nt|peachy: Plenty of boards for NS to catch up after this accident|pg||

nt|sybarra: sort of why not? shortening some one some where|pg||
nt|roswolf: why - when opps bid this way insults are deserved|pg||
nt|othered1: Only very slightly nsulting.  This hasn't exactly been a confident auction|pg||

nt|blum1956: West must establish a trick in a minor suit  to discard his 4th heart|pg||

mb|1D!|mb|p|mb|1H!|an|!S or inv bal|nt|Walddk2: Frances Hinden (Finch) and Jeffrey Allerton (jallerton) are two of our regular vugraph commentators. They are also a pair away from the table|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S!|an|no 4cm|mb|p|mb|1N|an|natural|nt|marlowepi: N was barred somehow?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is also an interesting contest in the sense that N-S and E-W have been and still are team-mates in other team events|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3N by W is best, club king and then spade queen give best hope to defense i think|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cK|nt|peachy: I think it is better to just say "inv bal" or whatever, "Natural" really isn't one of the options in the opening anyway|pg||

nt|Walddk2: It does not say after interference|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: although the chance of south having club length is a lot higher when he can't support north's majors of course|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c3|nt|roswolf: maybe not|pg||
nt|othered1: If that's multi, there are lots of different defenses to it.   Some let  you make a takeout "double" of @H immediately, but west's @S holding might be inadequate|pg||

pc|cK|nt|lestergold: no play of course for a push|pg||

nt|blum1956: 3@d is much better|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c7|pc|h2|pg||
nt|yo_yo: tempting to bid 3NT with the north hand now|pg||
nt|lestergold: twice as many bnids to reach 3N in open room that was the only difference|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|nt|ady: now overboard     unavoidable once North bids 2@D   south can really only raise|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d4|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: they have gone back to a more standard strong club basis but they keep the swapped majors in the response to 1@D|pg||

nt|athene: invitational even|pg||
nt|athene: sorry they used to play 1@S = 5+ hearts|pg||
pc|h7|nt|athene: they changed their system because the EBU changed the licensing regulations|pg||
