nt|brolucius: Declarer had 10 top tricks and needed a diamond ruff (or 3-3 diamonds) to bring it to 11. So, even if he placed the @DQ with East, I don;t think he could make 12 tricks.|pg||

mb|2S|nt|vinbtech: with his 6151 distribution|pg||
nt|chick: This is the last board of this session.   We will return in 1 hour with the next (last for today).|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vinbtech: surely N will now close shop with 4H !|pg||
nt|capercliff: are they going too high?|pg||
nt|vinbtech: or is it W who has pulled the shutters ? lol|pg||
nt|capercliff: can set up the Q@d for a @c pitch?|pg||
pc|c9|nt|ady: but still only 11 tricks  will need to draw 2 trumps to enjoy Q@D   so can only ruff 2 spades   |pg||
