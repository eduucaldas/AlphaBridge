pc|c6|pc|cJ|pc|h2|pg||

nt|bridge_one: but need to play for Qx in @D|pg||
nt|bridge_one: East know 5@H out and 1 @S, so i think he will play AK@D|pg||
nt|loganrun: Declarer is not home and may well go wrong here|pg||
nt|bridge_one: East is thinking bec North open 2@S, so normally not 4@H in the hand - this means @d 3/3 ...|pg||
nt|bridge_one: @h win findind North with the same card, but 3@d and KQ in @H - playing @H the suit is bloked|pg||
nt|bridge_one: so can misread the hands|pg||
nt|bridge_one: playing for this layout in North: @S7 @HKQ (orAQ) @DQ73|pg||

nt|xenya: still some work to do for declarer|pg||
nt|xenya: and playing trumps was not a good idea|pg||
nt|bridge_one: could play to ruff 2@s, but choose another way (take A@C ruffing)|pg||
nt|loganrun: North was not counting - on the first card - West is almost certainly known to have 4 spades and at least 5 hearts - club shortage is a real possibility|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like he is down now -- setting up a club trick without touching trumps would have worked -- but not easy|pg||
nt|bridge_one: North having a passed hand in front think impossible to find AK in @D in South after K in @s|pg||
pc|c8|nt|pamela: nice spot..  can have a bit of fun running the hearts once Ace sp out|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|nt|bjacobs: I can't agree with that.  4@S is a horrible contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: One way to resolve North's problem would be to have a natural non-forcing 2@S bid available over 1@H|pg||

nt|bjacobs: West has a clear opening bid, no?|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Hard to avoid 3NT, I agree. The layout could have been better for declarer|pg||

nt|bjacobs: Could well be, but I don't think East was thinking that this was a very thin game at all|pg||
nt|roswolf: still when both teams have the same philosophy it doesnt matter|pg||
nt|vugraphzan: E still thinking|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c9|pg||

nt|bridge_one: 2@S seam strange, but using 2@d IV suit GF is fine, because the partner can bid pas (2,3@S, and with sgl/void in @S can bid 3@c with 5 cards or 2Nt with 4)|pg||
nt|loganrun: Strykier knows when to bid 5 card majors (1NT on 5 last time and 2S this time)|pg||
