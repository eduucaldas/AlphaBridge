nt|Walddk3: Operator error|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Welcome back to Robin Barker|pg||
nt|frankaus: 9 wil be a great score|pg||
nt|haans: Operator any new about  scores from Oslo?|pg||
nt|haans: Results: http://nbfdata.bridge.no/Turnering/default.asp?Fil=1049f100828  :(|pg||
nt|haans: may end with a double|pg||
nt|bvdahl: I was surprised they didn't use neg x's in that spot|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|bvdahl: this could get bad for whoever gets the contract|pg||
mb|1N|nt|Walddk3: Do you know how to correct, Tore?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: wk 2s|pg||
mb|d|mb|2C|nt|haans: FOSS Grand Tournament  2010 http://privat.bluezone.no/rayh/Bridge-filer/FBK/FredrikstadBK.htm|pg||

nt|lestergold: Good morning haans et al|pg||
nt|bvdahl: very common in Norway|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: 1 N=n 8-11 HC!|pg||

mb|2D|nt|sharkey: View pd's pass not sure everyone wud Dbl with North's hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|rmb1: West is enormous opposite a strong NT|pg||
nt|frankaus: south rather skinny for me at theses colours|pg||
nt|rmb1: Not clear to players who can make what, so keep bidding|pg||
mb|3C|nt|blum1956: Do thay have methods to discover the @d fit?|pg||
nt|sharkey: S must be thinking slam...|pg||
nt|baardolav: here ns will reach...? 5 or 6?|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: true|pg||
nt|haans: neg double better than Lebesohl|pg||
mb|p|nt|blum1956: 5@s will cost NS 500|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: N said they owned 4. level! But not 5.:)|pg||
nt|bvdahl: 3 NT might be he only way to not get x|pg||
nt|haans: yes 1@D may be perfect opening|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: may be defense error in  spades|pg||
pc|h3|nt|cuttysark: Needs a lot - 2 working aces and good trump splits - but hey...|pg||
pc|h5|nt|rmb1: Looks like 4NT RKCB, 5@S 2A+@SQ can this be right?|pg||
nt|haans: 4NT quant say many advanced playes|pg||
nt|bvdahl: looks like 2 + 2 + 3 + 1|pg||
nt|bvdahl: can there be some endplay in spades/diamonds against north for 9?|pg||
nt|sharkey: 1. round of the day - both pairs need to work on their slam bidding |pg||
pc|hA|nt|rmb1: So do I but what is 5@S|pg||
nt|blum1956: No they do not. At least E seems to have answered RKCB|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|haans: some say both neg x + lebesohl|pg||
pc|h7|nt|haans: 2+Q|pg||
nt|baardolav: Not doubled... this slam will score more than the other EW slam one down|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hK|nt|rmb1: South's skinny 2@S may not deliver the one trick North needs|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d8|nt|vugraphzpu: We are very gratefull for getting sponsors. That makes it easier to run a good tourney. This year Vognservice, Lislerud, Fredriksstad blad, sa (Sarpsborg arbeiderblad), COWI A/S, ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: AS Demokraten and Felleskjøpet are supporting us! |pg||
nt|jbgood: nice to see so many newspapers sponsoring bridge!|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dA|pg||
nt|lestergold: spade better i think|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dJ|nt|blum1956: Now 12 tricks are easy. More probable 13 as S is squeezed automatically|pg||
pc|dT|nt|haans: @D8 and you are off|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hJ|pc|h2|nt|blum1956: A huge gain while playing MP's|pg||
nt|blum1956: E should be satisfied with 12 tricks therefore he gets 13|pg||
nt|rmb1: Declarer will cash 4 @H and 4@D and South will have to establish @C5 or unguard @SK.  Declarer will just cash his winners for +1|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: Something got wrong, dev took his trx in d odd h and at table in tr 12 had s4 to the king |pg||
nt|haans: is he claiming now?|pg||
nt|rmb1: But the duplication of shape in the minors should mean -1|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|haans: Hi Baard Hi Mike Hi Kath|pg||

nt|vugraphzpu: There turned ut endplay so N had to play spade.One down|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c3|pc|c6|nt|frankaus: looks like -1 none the less  what 50 scores is a real mystery 2 me but a + should br ok|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sA|nt|cuttysark: 4@C is quite a clever bid - takes away opponents cuebid and invites penalties - but it should also have some defence to a major suit contract |pg||
pc|sT|nt|rmb1: North must hope South has @DJ|pg||

nt|vugraphzpu: Now there is 52 pairs with eager bridge- players gathered in the "Music house" at Greaker, a village in Sarpsborg. Cloudy wether, perfect for sitting inside, warm and cosy and ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: compete. Not mud- bicycle as some other "crasy Norwegian" are running today, from Rena, crossing some mountan and ending at Lillehammer. |pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: Hi, my name is Tore Farbrot. I m member of Fredrikstad BC, autoriced TL and fond of bridgeplaying. |pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: Ready again, trouble with start sesj 3|pg||
nt|baardolav: 1-1 |pg||
nt|cuttysark: But who would trust an opponent?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i guess 4@H -1?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|baardolav: never trust the opponents...|pg||
mb|1D|nt|vugraphzpu: all col 1. rnd?|pg||

mb|p|nt|haans: and we have a psych :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3N-1 also|pg||
nt|bvdahl: 3 NT N, I would think, and E will need to find club shift when he gains entry in hearts...and W cant afford to pitch any clubs|pg||
mb|1H|nt|haans: :(|pg||
mb|p|nt|blum1956: clear 4@h|pg||
nt|baardolav: but someone have agreements on 3x-- Double-- 3nt weak pre, raise more cards|pg||
nt|haans: part score i say|pg||
mb|1N|nt|yo_yo: undo|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: good 1nt opening i say|pg||
nt|blum1956: Is it time to pass?|pg||

mb|p|nt|haans: Results: http://nbfdata.bridge.no/Turnering/default.asp?Fil=1049f100828  :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: S showed 14-16 HC|pg||
nt|cuttysark: This looks rather like another failinf contract in 3NT but it may be tougher to defend|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: 2d= forcing ch Back?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpu: Hi, and welcome to follow the leaders table from the FOSS- tourneys. Each sessions last for ab 2 hours. There will be 4 sessions today. Its an open pair tourney with MP and Swiss, ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: table 1 is the leaders table. Hope you will have much fun while watching us . |pg||
nt|bvdahl: can east play D7 on the lead...?|pg||
mb|p|nt|baardolav: So the 3opener can be part of the Decition to make a pre on 5level|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Looks like it - South has made the most descriptve bid available|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 16+9 = game surely|pg||
nt|lestergold: 25 combined|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: 10 trx made|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 10 tricks that's good going|pg||
nt|lestergold: a good time to 'underbid'!|pg||
pc|s5|mc|10|nt|haans: not my bridge|pg||
nt|rmb1: What is double by East? @S+@C or just "values"|pg||
nt|haans: 3@D = one minor 3@H which 3@S clubs|pg||
nt|haans: we will soon find out|pg||
nt|haans: nope|pg||

mb|p|mb|3S|nt|blum1956: And now?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: 3H= Max+ 4+h|pg||
nt|sharkey: Hard to make any contract today....|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Even 2NT looks impossible here|pg||
nt|baardolav: Livgaard choose 1d instead of 1nt... so the NTbid will be on the strong hand... maybe not the lucky choise this time|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: finding anything more?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Doesn't feel right to bid 1NT with 3 suits unstopped - but it's all in the lead :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: 2 or 3 NT looks like the par contract here|pg||
nt|bvdahl: i think 3 NT makes in practice|pg||
nt|lestergold: easy slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: Land on a pin head in 4@C ?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|baardolav: yeah... true|pg||
nt|cuttysark: At pairs it is right to pass with the flat 6 count|pg||
nt|haans: hearts lead and soon doen|pg||
nt|haans: done|pg||
nt|sharkey: Now right to duck @H lead...|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Alwasy easier to make 9 tricks in 2NT than 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: 5th highest lead should give a clue|pg||
mb|4N|nt|rmb1: I hope East thanked West for the rather good dummy!|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: always underbid when trumps suit no good :)|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: 5@D = 0 or 3 KC  probably|pg||
nt|haans: in my book 2nt is not forcing|pg||
nt|lestergold: combined 33 6@s good 6N doubtful|pg||
nt|yo_yo: and does East sign off in case it's 0?|pg||
mb|6S|nt|haans: OR http://nbfdata.bridge.no/Turnering/default.asp?Fil=1049f100828|pg||
nt|rmb1: Showing a good 4@C bid|pg||
nt|frankaus: we call this walking the dog here|pg||
mb|p|nt|blum1956: Not the best result for NS, even 6@c doubled has been OK |pg||
mb|p|nt|baardolav: should play low there solberg|pg||
nt|haans: innovative play :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: @H lead give 1 take 3|pg||
nt|yo_yo: in my book it's 98% forcing|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: 5d= 0-3|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|frankaus: hoping 4 the X|pg||
nt|bvdahl: 11 or 12 now depending on if E has the courage to finesse clubs in the end.|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|nt|cuttysark: Smith peter should tell East not to continue hearts - if they play that convention|pg||
nt|haans: and the sun goes down|pg||
nt|baardolav: this is going to be a sad board for  NS...|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|sharkey: so off 2|pg||
nt|yo_yo: TY tore|pg||
pc|sA|nt|rmb1: Nothing to this @D and @HA to lose|pg||
nt|rmb1: Now we wait for the next pair(s) to arrive|pg||
nt|haans: 6@H no @D lead|pg||
nt|haans: finding hearts would not have been easy|pg||
nt|blum1956: No, still one diamond to go away|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: Siv Thoresen- Jonny Hansen are one of the expected favourite pairs! Siv is playing at the norw lady team, is norw champ in mix- NM last year with Jo-Arve Ovesen and is a tough opps ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: to meet! Jonny had wery good results from this year Festival at Lillehammer and among other has been winner tow years on row in Fredrikstad-tourneys together with Arve Farstad!|pg||
nt|haans: kibs say no slam I stabnd corrected|pg||
nt|rmb1: More example of 4-4 fit at the six level being better than 6-4.  As in the infamous Springold 0346 hand|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s2|pc|s3|pg||
pc|s4|nt|haans: 98% is nf in my book|pg||
pc|c2|nt|haans: you got @HK free |pg||
pc|sT|nt|bvdahl: 6 NT's make also. Cash all tricks except @CA and endplay north in @H|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|c5|nt|yo_yo: 99 then|pg||
pc|c4|nt|haans: :)|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|sharkey: not sure they'll be alone - some may even go down more|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|rmb1: If East resisted doubling and West lead a major that would be -400|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|bvdahl: yes, but normal contract and probably normal lead|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c6|nt|haans: :)|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|haans: not all will lead @H|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Those who stretch to 3NT will surely be at least -2|pg||
nt|haans: some may even be in game|pg||
nt|sharkey: not easy to make more than 6 tricks - at the table|pg||
pc|c3|nt|blum1956: E's double of 3NT looks too ambitious. If 3NT goes down the score should be perfect even undoubled.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: And perfectly normal contract - on a kinder day game makes easily|pg||
nt|haans: BBO Schedule your time: http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php |pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: Nxt rnd are starting now!:)|pg||
pc|c9|nt|frankaus: lots of gr8 bridge - hope we see more |pg||
nt|blum1956: sometimes one doubles in such a position in order to make S run to 4@c while 3NT making. From E's point of view this time it should hardly be the case|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: Knut Molander- Geir Andersen are probable the very best pair from our district today. Both have good results, Knut has been norw champ as senior several times. |pg||
pc|sQ|pc|d6|pg||
mc|12|nt|yo_yo: wow that's a great play if anyone finds it, Baard|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: nxt rnd start ab 5 min from now! |pg||
nt|lestergold: cant really be found in practice because club finesse is preferable to playing north for being out of diamonds|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: Johnny Moen- Olav Hjerkinn is a very experienced pair from Ski BC, both old friends of mine. Tough players as well|pg||
nt|haans: you make most endplays double dummy|pg||
nt|yo_yo: how many pairs are there  tore?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: Jorunn Feness- Kjell Ole Kopstad are very good players with many excelent mix- tourney results together. Have played steadily here, missing last year we regret! |pg||
nt|haans: 50|pg||
nt|bvdahl: I think the endplay is the % play when you see the spades are 4-1|pg||
nt|yo_yo: how many women?|pg||
nt|haans: assume a lot :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: it would be if you could read the diamond distribution but i do not see how you could achieve that|pg||
nt|yo_yo: a lot?  that's unusual|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|bvdahl: when you cash all the tricks, you know N has 3-5 clubs, which makes the average 4|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think you would go into the tank and take a club finesse in reality|pg||
nt|bvdahl: so clubs are likely to be 4-3 in norths favor whijch makes hom the favorite to have the king|pg||
nt|lestergold: otherwise you look very stupid when all that happemns in that when in with heart a diamond is cashed|pg||
nt|bvdahl: the odds are in favor of N having the king, so why finesse?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: the distribution might become clear on the presumed @D lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: because the odds are not infavour of north having only three diamonds|pg||
nt|bvdahl: besides, N will probably pitcj a D on spades, and then you will know for sure he has 5 clubs|pg||
nt|lestergold: unless as kath says you have good reason to place north with only three diamonds even on lead i doubt it|pg||
nt|bvdahl: you will know he has 1 sp 4 h 3-5 d's and 3-5 clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: We are very gratefull for getting sponsors. That makes it easier to run a good tourney. This year Vognservice, Lislerud, Fredriksstad blad, sa (Sarpsborg arbeiderblad), COWI A/S, ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: AS Demokraten and Felleskjøpet are supporting us! |pg||
nt|lestergold: defence would try and onscure theior distribuition|pg||
nt|bvdahl: what do you pitch on 4x spades in north?|pg||
nt|bvdahl: you have to let one diamond go|pg||
nt|bvdahl: then, in 3 x diamonds you will see that N is 1435|pg||

mb|1D|nt|blum1956: Let us recall the board where EW made 6NT with an overtrick. There exists a good method to show the spade support and FG values after 2@c Stayman and 2@s responce. You just bid 3@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|bvdahl: EW might have the highest contract in 2 spades|pg||
mb|1N|nt|haans: weak spade a killer|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: Opps nr 8 now, NS leder pair|pg||

nt|baardolav: well it is almost same as 2small|pg||

nt|haans: Repeat Stayman normal in Norway|pg||
nt|haans: mostly 15-17 or Big Clubs then 14-16|pg||

nt|haans: right track|pg||
nt|yo_yo: declarer is suspicious|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|blum1956: Why not 1NT then?|pg||
nt|rmb1: Looks like a weak/mini opening NT and 1@C includes balanced 15+|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|blum1956: I would risked 6@c havin S's hand|pg||

nt|cuttysark: Combined 23 count - not usually enough for 5 of a minor|pg||
pc|s2|pg||

nt|lestergold: north must of course attack the entries to dummy|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Tore i dont understand what that means|pg||

nt|haans: how to handle @H|pg||

nt|vugraphzpu: Sry no TL internet conn , so results are available first after finishing sessions|pg||
nt|haans: 110|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|blum1956: will S believe the @c10 is a honest card?|pg||
nt|frankaus: is this a real restricted choice ??|pg||
nt|rmb1: No.  I think it would be right to play @C10 from 10x, so parnter can score his potential Q|pg||
nt|haans: asking to you have singel in their suit|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Could he not double to show a better hand?|pg||
nt|baardolav: in my book 4@d is a clear fight... for invite bid something else|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cT|nt|rmb1: @SJ was a good try (worth thinking about) but the spade pips are good enough for declarer|pg||
nt|blum1956: Now 9 tricks|pg||
nt|haans: @SJ psyching play|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|blum1956: Clearly he may deduce the @c10 is not a singleton as the defence should set the contract by the @sK in the 2nd trick. But it may be doubleton|pg||
nt|frankaus: at this level @Ct is mandatory|pg||
nt|frankaus: from Tx|pg||
pc|cA|pg||

pc|h4|nt|bvdahl: now 10, on a club lead probably 8|pg||
pc|h2|nt|haans: an endplay :)|pg||

pc|hA|nt|blum1956: bravo!|pg||
nt|frankaus: good "nose"|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hJ|nt|cuttysark: I agree - rebidding your suit is usually the weakest option|pg||

nt|baardolav: 1spade - 2spade - 3spade... not invite ... same here|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Indeed - the idea that bridge could be fun!|pg||

nt|cuttysark: 4@D is indeed pushing them up - but you do have other ways to do that - bids that might help partner decide what to do|pg||
nt|baardolav: 23 HP... lets see theyr metods|pg||

nt|vugraphzpu: AS Demokraten and Felleskjøpet are supporting us! |pg||
nt|cuttysark: South is taking his time counting his points - always wise to check when you have so many|pg||
pc|d7|nt|rmb1: The truth about EW NT ranges starts to emerge :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: Trans, d= h|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i like that 2@H bid, tempting to jump to £@H|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 3|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but horrible distribution 4333|pg||
pc|d8|nt|cuttysark: Wow - that looks a very cautious position|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I would certainly bid some number of NT, partner would transfer, we would reach 4@H|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|hK|nt|blum1956: What is the correct opening by W 3rd in hand? 1@h which he chose or some kind of weak 2?|pg||
nt|haans: is that winning MP?|pg||
nt|bvdahl: would be a good hand to play walsh. Then S could re bid 1 NT|pg||
pc|h9|nt|frankaus: 1H 4 me  -i never open weak with 2 aces|pg||
nt|bvdahl: in walsh 1D denies 4 card major if not strong enough to fore to game later|pg||
nt|bvdahl: force|pg||
nt|bvdahl: so with 12-14 and 4 card major, opener can re-bid 1 NT|pg||
pc|h5|nt|blum1956: @sA is clearly the best lead|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|blum1956: even vulnerable 3rd hand?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|baardolav: yeah... and this time 3@d will not be a good score when 4@h makes easaly|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hA|pc|hT|pg||

nt|rmb1: The concensus among spec is that 2@D = one major (one vote for @H or (@S + m)|pg||

nt|haans: and a make|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|haans: the call it Multi-Landy the most popular NT defense nowdays|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: West can't be exited...|pg||

nt|haans: do not understand that 3@C whats to gain|pg||
nt|sharkey: Game invite I assume|pg||
mb|3S|nt|bvdahl: of course, look for fit in spades first. I was a bit quick|pg||
nt|haans: @CT golden|pg||
nt|bvdahl: but now 6 NT surely|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|Walddk3: It surprises me that you have not seen that before, Robin|pg||
nt|Walddk3: k|pg||
nt|rmb1: When partner transfers to play in 8xxxx its good to have some support|pg||
nt|bvdahl: but that risks giving up the heart suit|pg||
nt|haans: URKK|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk7: 3NT is plain silly|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: for a good 50%|pg||
mb|p|nt|bvdahl: yes, should be bid with 12 tricks at all tables|pg||
nt|bvdahl: but -1440 can never be a + for EW|pg||
nt|haans: want it to me invite but have not sais invit in spades|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 3@S looks clearer here - he has not bid 2@S immediately, so limited, encouraging partner to bid game if he actualy has 4 spades|pg||
nt|sharkey: 3@H alerted?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: He might as well bid 4@S at once as push partner into a corner and then bid it|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: 3h= trial bid|pg||
nt|yo_yo: N has to lead @C but i bet he doesnt|pg||
nt|bvdahl: 4 spades is down id NS attacs clubs in time, i think|pg||
nt|bvdahl: if|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sharkey: So both E & W are trying...|pg||
pc|h6|nt|haans: inviting with no stop buttom|pg||

pc|h5|nt|rmb1: All the aces are over NS kings, its going to be a battle|pg||
nt|haans: did have a good bid in 3@S|pg||
nt|bvdahl: yes, 3 spades would surely be a better bid|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|frankaus: i expect this will fail|pg||
nt|cuttysark: We call it passing the buck|pg||
nt|yo_yo: is there a trump promotion?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: K@H then another @H?|pg||
pc|d9|nt|rmb1: I have seen it before, played it and like it.  But op said 2D=H|pg||
nt|Walddk3: 2@C both majors  2@D  one major  2M  that major + a minor|pg||
nt|Walddk7: If Kopstad bids again over 3@C, he should choose 3@S|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3 rounds of hearts can create a guess for declarer when the T@s ruffs in|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d3|pc|d2|pg||
nt|rmb1: At least North can make his clubs|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Then they will avoid the ridiculous 3NT|pg||
nt|bvdahl: well, in the end they found the right spot :)|pg||
nt|haans: halve pom|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s6|nt|haans: some may bid 4NT as Blackwood taken as invite|pg||

nt|cuttysark: Yes - fortunately there is no diamond ruff|pg||
nt|haans: be a good boy say nthank you opps|pg||
nt|sharkey: I just can't see West has any extras... agree with Liz East shud probably take the plunge and bid it himself|pg||
pc|d7|nt|blum1956: I'd probably bid 2@c majors on the previous board. The standard for S is to bid 2@d with majors equal in length or 3-2. Then N bids 2@h|pg||
nt|bvdahl: it could be, but he can finess the @s9|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pc|dK|pg||

pc|s2|pg||
nt|bvdahl: anyone for balancing 2@H on north's hand?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Balancing is good - but I really hate this 5332 shape and the cards are just wrong|pg||
nt|sharkey: not me - showing my age...|pg||
nt|baardolav: I am balancing|pg||
nt|sharkey: also - pd always shows up with x or xx in @H when I do|pg||
nt|haans: balancing should have a singelton or else pass|pg||
nt|baardolav: if partner have a single heart he would bid first round with his points:)|pg||
nt|bvdahl: I think I would balance. More variance, but I think you'll gain in the long run|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Balancing works here because you can escape for 1 down - but how luvky is it to find partner with 4trump and good fillers, and they cannot ruff a spade?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: Johnny Moen- Olav Hjerkinn is a very experienced pair from Ski BC, both old friends of mine. Tough players as well|pg||
nt|haans: balance and go down what fun it that|pg||
nt|sharkey: Why not bid with S hand - showing Majors?|pg||
nt|haans: couse p would bid 2|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Going down has to be fun - or we would not play :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: After all - pd has some points|pg||

nt|baardolav: if you will not go down... then you have to go home|pg||

nt|bvdahl: I think with 5@c in north's hand it is possible to get -4 with a singleton @d lead|pg||
nt|sharkey: rite Baard|pg||
nt|lestergold: my experience here is that they probab;y make 4@s when you have so much in partner's long suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: there is alaso the arguiment is taht god gace you a singleton in order to lead it for a ruff|pg||

nt|sharkey: West hasnt shown his @D support at all|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: Gerber are not popular nowdays|pg||
