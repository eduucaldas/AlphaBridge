nt|vugraphzpu: some misunderstanding NS|pg||
nt|olliebol: well ew on their way to three nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: South has shown some values, and North has shown a NT range (?)|pg||
nt|baardolav: I was going to say a standard 4spades here... but it will be 5|pg||
nt|baardolav: If Eide Lomsdale have their blackwood agreements ok|pg||
nt|Walddk1: http://nbfdata.bridge.no/Turnering/default.asp?Fil=1049f100828  for standings after yesterday's 2 sessions|pg||
nt|sharkey: Not often slam is bid after opps open bidding - lacking two aces here|pg||
nt|Walddk1: I believe it's a new tournament today|pg||
nt|sharkey: hei Tore|pg||
mb|p|nt|blum1956: Even if you open 1NT the result will be the same|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Also 2 sessions of 32 boards|pg||
pc|h5|nt|olliebol: said i....|pg||
nt|olliebol: couldnt guess this contract|pg||

pc|h4|pg||
pc|cK|nt|Walddk3: 4th best from your longest and strongest strikes again|pg||
nt|baardolav: Well some blackwood lessons after torney?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|vugraphzpu: Sorry, had disturb. and missed two trix. Gives only result.|pg||

nt|haans: not wrong try|pg||
nt|haans: we all done worse|pg||

pc|c9|pg||
pc|hK|nt|Walddk1: Format is matchpointed pairs|pg||
pc|h6|nt|vugraphzpu: Sry 3 d-4! |pg||

pc|hA|pg||
nt|Walddk1: http://nbfdata.bridge.no/Turnering/default.asp?Fil=1049f100829|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hQ|nt|rmb1: EW have discovered their @H suit|pg||
pc|s8|pc|h7|pg||
nt|cuttysark: In which case going down in slam is only one of may ways to achieve a poor score|pg||
pc|sT|nt|blum1956: But that is MP's so one setting trick less may cost|pg||
nt|rmb1: Declarer has the rest for -1|pg||
nt|haans: claiming time|pg||
nt|cuttysark: And checking your Balckwood agreements is only one of many things you should do at the start of each session :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: Yesterdays results are found here http://nbfdata.bridge.no/Turnering/default.asp?Fil=1049f100828|pg||
nt|sharkey: 5@C either showed 0,1 or 3 or 4 KC I think - dont understand 6@S|pg||

nt|blum1956: Smth went wrong? Why just made?|pg||
nt|blum1956: OK|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Operator error|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Welcome back to Robin Barker|pg||
nt|frankaus: 9 wil be a great score|pg||
nt|haans: Operator any new about  scores from Oslo?|pg||
nt|haans: Results: http://nbfdata.bridge.no/Turnering/default.asp?Fil=1049f100828  :(|pg||
nt|haans: may end with a double|pg||
nt|bvdahl: I was surprised they didn't use neg x's in that spot|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: good afternoon from Manchester |pg||
mb|p|nt|bvdahl: this could get bad for whoever gets the contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk3: Do you know how to correct, Tore?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: wk 2s|pg||
nt|olliebol: hello Kath|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|haans: FOSS Grand Tournament  2010 http://privat.bluezone.no/rayh/Bridge-filer/FBK/FredrikstadBK.htm|pg||
nt|haans: neg double after NT slowly (slowly) on its way up|pg||
nt|lestergold: Good morning haans et al|pg||
nt|bvdahl: very common in Norway|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: 1 N=n 8-11 HC!|pg||
nt|haans: just wait a hundred years :)|pg||
mb|1D|nt|sharkey: View pd's pass not sure everyone wud Dbl with North's hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|rmb1: West is enormous opposite a strong NT|pg||
nt|frankaus: south rather skinny for me at theses colours|pg||
nt|rmb1: Not clear to players who can make what, so keep bidding|pg||
mb|1N|nt|blum1956: Do thay have methods to discover the @d fit?|pg||
nt|sharkey: S must be thinking slam...|pg||
nt|baardolav: here ns will reach...? 5 or 6?|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: true|pg||
nt|haans: neg double better than Lebesohl|pg||
mb|p|nt|blum1956: 5@s will cost NS 500|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: N said they owned 4. level! But not 5.:)|pg||
nt|bvdahl: 3 NT might be he only way to not get x|pg||
nt|haans: yes 1@D may be perfect opening|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: may be defense error in  spades|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|cuttysark: Needs a lot - 2 working aces and good trump splits - but hey...|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 1@S would be 4th suit forcing so difficult to find the 4-4 @S fit|pg||
nt|olliebol: guess ew play 1@s as fourth suit here so no @s bid from east|pg||
pc|d8|nt|rmb1: Looks like 4NT RKCB, 5@S 2A+@SQ can this be right?|pg||
nt|haans: 4NT quant say many advanced playes|pg||
nt|bvdahl: looks like 2 + 2 + 3 + 1|pg||
nt|bvdahl: can there be some endplay in spades/diamonds against north for 9?|pg||
nt|sharkey: 1. round of the day - both pairs need to work on their slam bidding |pg||
pc|dK|nt|rmb1: So do I but what is 5@S|pg||
nt|blum1956: No they do not. At least E seems to have answered RKCB|pg||
nt|olliebol: rite:)|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|haans: some say both neg x + lebesohl|pg||
nt|yo_yo: I actually play it as natural in this position|pg||
pc|d9|nt|haans: 2+Q|pg||
nt|baardolav: Not doubled... this slam will score more than the other EW slam one down|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dT|nt|rmb1: South's skinny 2@S may not deliver the one trick North needs|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|d6|nt|olliebol: not a bad idea here at all|pg||
pc|h3|nt|vugraphzpu: We are very gratefull for getting sponsors. That makes it easier to run a good tourney. This year Vognservice, Lislerud, Fredriksstad blad, sa (Sarpsborg arbeiderblad), COWI A/S, ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: AS Demokraten and Felleskjøpet are supporting us! |pg||
nt|jbgood: nice to see so many newspapers sponsoring bridge!|pg||
pc|c4|pc|dA|pg||
nt|lestergold: spade better i think|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s3|nt|blum1956: Now 12 tricks are easy. More probable 13 as S is squeezed automatically|pg||
pc|sA|nt|haans: @D8 and you are off|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|pc|s6|nt|blum1956: A huge gain while playing MP's|pg||
nt|blum1956: E should be satisfied with 12 tricks therefore he gets 13|pg||
nt|rmb1: Declarer will cash 4 @H and 4@D and South will have to establish @C5 or unguard @SK.  Declarer will just cash his winners for +1|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: Something got wrong, dev took his trx in d odd h and at table in tr 12 had s4 to the king |pg||
nt|haans: is he claiming now?|pg||
nt|rmb1: But the duplication of shape in the minors should mean -1|pg||
nt|yo_yo: although some easts would respond 1@S to avoid confusion |pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|haans: Hi Baard Hi Mike Hi Kath|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hi everyone|pg||
nt|lestergold: Hi Kath|pg||
nt|baardolav: Heyy|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c7|pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: There turned ut endplay so N had to play spade.One down|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|h6|pc|sJ|nt|frankaus: looks like -1 none the less  what 50 scores is a real mystery 2 me but a + should br ok|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|d7|mc|6|nt|cuttysark: 4@C is quite a clever bid - takes away opponents cuebid and invites penalties - but it should also have some defence to a major suit contract |pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: Sry -2|pg||
pg||
qx|o3|st||md|1SAQJ5HA6DT7CAKQT3,S6HKQ84DA532CJ975,S98432HJ7532DJ6C6,SKT7HT9DKQ984C842|sv|e|nt|frankaus: there is an interesting book by peter hall - competative biding at pairs - well worth a read if u find a copy in ur clubs library|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: Now there is 52 pairs with eager bridge- players gathered in the "Music house" at Greaker, a village in Sarpsborg. Cloudy wether, perfect for sitting inside, warm and cosy and ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: compete. Not mud- bicycle as some other "crasy Norwegian" are running today, from Rena, crossing some mountan and ending at Lillehammer. |pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: Hi, my name is Tore Farbrot. I m member of Fredrikstad BC, autoriced TL and fond of bridgeplaying. |pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: Ready again, trouble with start sesj 3|pg||
nt|baardolav: 1-1 |pg||
nt|cuttysark: But who would trust an opponent?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i guess 4@H -1?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that wont be good , i think 2@S makes|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|baardolav: never trust the opponents...|pg||
mb|1S|nt|vugraphzpu: all col 1. rnd?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: maybe get @C away  |pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: and we have a psych :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3N-1 also|pg||
nt|bvdahl: 3 NT N, I would think, and E will need to find club shift when he gains entry in hearts...and W cant afford to pitch any clubs|pg||
mb|4C|nt|haans: :(|pg||
mb|p|nt|blum1956: clear 4@h|pg||
nt|baardolav: but someone have agreements on 3x-- Double-- 3nt weak pre, raise more cards|pg||
nt|haans: part score i say|pg||
nt|olliebol: nice four @s here on the @s finesse|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: Prec NS|pg||
nt|yo_yo: with me that would be a good @C suit , 4 card @S support and game going hand|pg||
mb|4S|nt|yo_yo: undo|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ah not here then|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: good 1nt opening i say|pg||
nt|blum1956: Is it time to pass?|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: 4@h may be a chance here|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: Results: http://nbfdata.bridge.no/Turnering/default.asp?Fil=1049f100828  :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: S showed 14-16 HC|pg||
nt|cuttysark: This looks rather like another failinf contract in 3NT but it may be tougher to defend|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: 2d= forcing ch Back?|pg||
nt|olliebol: well it looks they agree with you|pg||
pc|dK|nt|vugraphzpu: Hi, and welcome to follow the leaders table from the FOSS- tourneys. Each sessions last for ab 2 hours. There will be 4 sessions today. Its an open pair tourney with MP and Swiss, ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: table 1 is the leaders table. Hope you will have much fun while watching us . |pg||
nt|bvdahl: can east play D7 on the lead...?|pg||
nt|bvdahl: don't thnk that was prec|pg||
pc|d7|nt|baardolav: So the 3opener can be part of the Decition to make a pre on 5level|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Looks like it - South has made the most descriptve bid available|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 16+9 = game surely|pg||
nt|lestergold: 25 combined|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: 10 trx made|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 10 tricks that's good going|pg||
nt|lestergold: a good time to 'underbid'!|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|haans: not my bridge|pg||
nt|rmb1: What is double by East? @S+@C or just "values"|pg||
nt|haans: 3@D = one minor 3@H which 3@S clubs|pg||
nt|haans: we will soon find out|pg||
nt|haans: nope|pg||
nt|bvdahl: not easy|pg||
nt|bvdahl: must continue d's now, I suppose|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: Already endplayed!:)|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|rmb1: NT is where you want to play, judging the level is less clear (if in doubt 3NT :))|pg||
nt|frankaus: looking 4 the majic 200|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: NS is leading afte 4. rnd|pg||
pc|dT|nt|blum1956: No way to go down |pg||
nt|cuttysark: Many pairs would reach this contract in fewer bids....|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Will West be inspired to lead a club?|pg||
nt|baardolav: no one bid club and spade... it is down with spade lead too?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: EW examinds the bidding|pg||
pc|d5|nt|frankaus: rewarded with 800 :)|pg||
nt|blum1956: Did N have just this idea when he passed 2@h? If yes - this is a magic bridge|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|bvdahl: best way to avoid endplay is to duck :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: feness just needs to get to hand twice to finesse @S|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hA|nt|baardolav: Q now|pg||
nt|cuttysark: If he ducks @SQ East should switch; if he doesn't, they can clear spades|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|pg||
nt|baardolav: Lomsdale forgot using the Q|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|nt|haans: more @D was easy|pg||

pc|s2|pc|s7|pc|sJ|pc|s6|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: EW ahead with  31 points over NS|pg||
nt|haans: Gjenstatt Stayman Geo BIR nr 2008|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: Jorunn Feness- Kjell Ole Kopstad are very good players with many excelent mix- tourney results together. Have played steadily here, missing last year we regret! |pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: W is thinking!!!!!|pg||
nt|cuttysark: But he then ducked the first heart, a good play that should compensate for not unblocking @SQ|pg||
nt|baardolav: yes... true|pg||
nt|olliebol: maybe east could have falsecarded the ten there|pg||
nt|yo_yo: good idea ollie|pg||
nt|olliebol: suggesting kx|pg||
nt|yo_yo: or in @C|pg||
nt|bvdahl: well, if pd has stiff J.... ;)|pg||
nt|olliebol: can cost a trick of course|pg||
nt|yo_yo: feness keeping us in suspense here|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: N thinking!|pg||
nt|yo_yo: which is more likely,  double @S or doubleton @C|pg||
nt|yo_yo: he has to think|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ah it's a lady north|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: N is female!!!!|pg||

pc|s4|pc|sT|nt|baardolav: now one down... too...|pg||

nt|yo_yo: 2 nice boards against the leaders for Jorunn |pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|rmb1: NS will probably bid to 5@C|pg||

nt|vugraphzpu: 3H= Max+ 4+h|pg||
nt|sharkey: Hard to make any contract today....|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Even 2NT looks impossible here|pg||
nt|baardolav: Livgaard choose 1d instead of 1nt... so the NTbid will be on the strong hand... maybe not the lucky choise this time|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: finding anything more?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Doesn't feel right to bid 1NT with 3 suits unstopped - but it's all in the lead :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: 2 or 3 NT looks like the par contract here|pg||
nt|bvdahl: i think 3 NT makes in practice|pg||
nt|lestergold: easy slam|pg||
pc|cA|nt|rmb1: Land on a pin head in 4@C ?|pg||
nt|olliebol: highly agressive opposite a passed p the 1nt bid|pg||
pc|c3|nt|baardolav: yeah... true|pg||
nt|cuttysark: At pairs it is right to pass with the flat 6 count|pg||
nt|haans: hearts lead and soon doen|pg||
nt|haans: done|pg||
nt|sharkey: Now right to duck @H lead...|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Alwasy easier to make 9 tricks in 2NT than 3NT|pg||
pc|c7|nt|cuttysark: 5th highest lead should give a clue|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|rmb1: I hope East thanked West for the rather good dummy!|pg||
pc|h4|nt|haans: always underbid when trumps suit no good :)|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hK|nt|yo_yo: 5@D = 0 or 3 KC  probably|pg||
nt|haans: in my book 2nt is not forcing|pg||
nt|lestergold: combined 33 6@s good 6N doubtful|pg||
nt|yo_yo: and does East sign off in case it's 0?|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|haans: OR http://nbfdata.bridge.no/Turnering/default.asp?Fil=1049f100828|pg||

nt|frankaus: we call this walking the dog here|pg||
nt|yo_yo: will declarer take the @D finesse?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|blum1956: Not the best result for NS, even 6@c doubled has been OK |pg||
pc|d3|nt|baardolav: should play low there solberg|pg||

nt|bvdahl: 11 or 12 now depending on if E has the courage to finesse clubs in the end.|pg||

pc|d8|nt|sharkey: so off 2|pg||
nt|yo_yo: TY tore|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|rmb1: Nothing to this @D and @HA to lose|pg||
nt|rmb1: Now we wait for the next pair(s) to arrive|pg||
nt|haans: 6@H no @D lead|pg||
nt|haans: finding hearts would not have been easy|pg||
nt|blum1956: No, still one diamond to go away|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: Siv Thoresen- Jonny Hansen are one of the expected favourite pairs! Siv is playing at the norw lady team, is norw champ in mix- NM last year with Jo-Arve Ovesen and is a tough opps ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: to meet! Jonny had wery good results from this year Festival at Lillehammer and among other has been winner tow years on row in Fredrikstad-tourneys together with Arve Farstad!|pg||
nt|haans: kibs say no slam I stabnd corrected|pg||
nt|rmb1: More example of 4-4 fit at the six level being better than 6-4.  As in the infamous Springold 0346 hand|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d9|pc|s4|pc|dT|pg||
nt|haans: 98% is nf in my book|pg||

pc|h6|pc|cK|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 99 then|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|haans: :)|pg||
pc|h7|nt|sharkey: not sure they'll be alone - some may even go down more|pg||
pc|h2|nt|rmb1: If East resisted doubling and West lead a major that would be -400|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|bvdahl: yes, but normal contract and probably normal lead|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h9|nt|haans: :)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|haans: not all will lead @H|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Those who stretch to 3NT will surely be at least -2|pg||
nt|haans: some may even be in game|pg||
nt|sharkey: not easy to make more than 6 tricks - at the table|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|blum1956: E's double of 3NT looks too ambitious. If 3NT goes down the score should be perfect even undoubled.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: And perfectly normal contract - on a kinder day game makes easily|pg||
nt|haans: BBO Schedule your time: http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php |pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: Nxt rnd are starting now!:)|pg||
pc|s6|nt|frankaus: lots of gr8 bridge - hope we see more |pg||
nt|blum1956: sometimes one doubles in such a position in order to make S run to 4@c while 3NT making. From E's point of view this time it should hardly be the case|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: Knut Molander- Geir Andersen are probable the very best pair from our district today. Both have good results, Knut has been norw champ as senior several times. |pg||
pc|sA|pc|sQ|pc|s3|pg||
nt|yo_yo: wow that's a great play if anyone finds it, Baard|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: nxt rnd start ab 5 min from now! |pg||
nt|lestergold: cant really be found in practice because club finesse is preferable to playing north for being out of diamonds|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: Johnny Moen- Olav Hjerkinn is a very experienced pair from Ski BC, both old friends of mine. Tough players as well|pg||
nt|haans: you make most endplays double dummy|pg||
nt|yo_yo: how many pairs are there  tore?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: Jorunn Feness- Kjell Ole Kopstad are very good players with many excelent mix- tourney results together. Have played steadily here, missing last year we regret! |pg||
nt|haans: 50|pg||
nt|bvdahl: I think the endplay is the % play when you see the spades are 4-1|pg||
nt|yo_yo: how many women?|pg||
nt|haans: assume a lot :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: it would be if you could read the diamond distribution but i do not see how you could achieve that|pg||
nt|yo_yo: a lot?  that's unusual|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|bvdahl: when you cash all the tricks, you know N has 3-5 clubs, which makes the average 4|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think you would go into the tank and take a club finesse in reality|pg||
nt|bvdahl: so clubs are likely to be 4-3 in norths favor whijch makes hom the favorite to have the king|pg||
nt|lestergold: otherwise you look very stupid when all that happemns in that when in with heart a diamond is cashed|pg||
nt|bvdahl: the odds are in favor of N having the king, so why finesse?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: the distribution might become clear on the presumed @D lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: because the odds are not infavour of north having only three diamonds|pg||
nt|bvdahl: besides, N will probably pitcj a D on spades, and then you will know for sure he has 5 clubs|pg||
nt|lestergold: unless as kath says you have good reason to place north with only three diamonds even on lead i doubt it|pg||
nt|bvdahl: you will know he has 1 sp 4 h 3-5 d's and 3-5 clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: We are very gratefull for getting sponsors. That makes it easier to run a good tourney. This year Vognservice, Lislerud, Fredriksstad blad, sa (Sarpsborg arbeiderblad), COWI A/S, ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: AS Demokraten and Felleskjøpet are supporting us! |pg||
nt|lestergold: defence would try and onscure theior distribuition|pg||
nt|bvdahl: what do you pitch on 4x spades in north?|pg||
nt|bvdahl: you have to let one diamond go|pg||
nt|bvdahl: then, in 3 x diamonds you will see that N is 1435|pg||
nt|lestergold: I am always looking for these doubled ummy endplays I am usually disappointed perhaps Balicki dlecaring |pg||
nt|haans: Welcome to Ørjan Bakke and Beir Hanssen (novices) |pg||
nt|bvdahl: so it is 5-2 in favor of N having the king|pg||
nt|haans: Berit|pg||

mb|2S|nt|blum1956: Let us recall the board where EW made 6NT with an overtrick. There exists a good method to show the spade support and FG values after 2@c Stayman and 2@s responce. You just bid 3@h|pg||
nt|yo_yo: weak 2@S?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes|pg||
mb|3D|nt|bvdahl: EW might have the highest contract in 2 spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: weak spade a killer|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: Opps nr 8 now, NS leder pair|pg||
nt|olliebol: unfortunately ns got the same singleton|pg||

mb|p|mb|5C|nt|haans: Lunum not happy but good score|pg||

nt|baardolav: well it is almost same as 2small|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpu: 4 col forcing|pg||
nt|blum1956: Not easy to check for a @cQ using RKCB. Other method needed|pg||
nt|haans: EWE does not have 4@H|pg||
mb|5D|nt|haans: or 3@C repeat Stayman |pg||
mb|p|nt|blum1956: What kind of NT range do all these people have?|pg||
nt|haans: Repeat Stayman normal in Norway|pg||
nt|haans: mostly 15-17 or Big Clubs then 14-16|pg||
nt|bvdahl: but difficult to find now|pg||
nt|bvdahl: I would bid 3 h's on Norths hand|pg||
nt|yo_yo: not easy to play |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzpu: bt pairs ab -16 last rnd!|pg||

nt|yo_yo: i like the cuk|pg||

nt|bvdahl: :)|pg||
nt|haans: right track|pg||
nt|yo_yo: declarer is suspicious|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|blum1956: Why not 1NT then?|pg||
nt|rmb1: Looks like a weak/mini opening NT and 1@C includes balanced 15+|pg||
nt|haans: some play it weaker|pg||
pc|sT|nt|blum1956: I would risked 6@c havin S's hand|pg||
nt|baardolav: or +2|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Combined 23 count - not usually enough for 5 of a minor|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|haans: did hear you :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: north must of course attack the entries to dummy|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Tore i dont understand what that means|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h2|nt|lestergold: ay the same toime putting declarer to a guess|pg||
pc|hA|nt|cuttysark: But North has excellent cards - maybe he should push|pg||

pc|h4|pg||
nt|bvdahl: if pd is void in spades, 6@d can't be far off....|pg||
pc|h3|nt|haans: most would bid 2@D MIchael and 4@H soon|pg||

nt|yo_yo: but horrible distribution 4333|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Wow - that looks a very cautious position|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I would certainly bid some number of NT, partner would transfer, we would reach 4@H|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|blum1956: What is the correct opening by W 3rd in hand? 1@h which he chose or some kind of weak 2?|pg||
nt|haans: is that winning MP?|pg||
nt|bvdahl: would be a good hand to play walsh. Then S could re bid 1 NT|pg||
nt|olliebol: in fact give it one good try(4@s) and leave the rest to partner|pg||
pc|hK|nt|frankaus: 1H 4 me  -i never open weak with 2 aces|pg||
nt|bvdahl: in walsh 1D denies 4 card major if not strong enough to fore to game later|pg||
nt|bvdahl: force|pg||
nt|bvdahl: so with 12-14 and 4 card major, opener can re-bid 1 NT|pg||
nt|yo_yo: the lady in the spotlight again|pg||
pc|h2|nt|blum1956: @sA is clearly the best lead|pg||
pc|h7|nt|blum1956: even vulnerable 3rd hand?|pg||

nt|bvdahl: but -1440 can never be a + for EW|pg||
nt|haans: want it to me invite but have not sais invit in spades|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 3@S looks clearer here - he has not bid 2@S immediately, so limited, encouraging partner to bid game if he actualy has 4 spades|pg||
nt|sharkey: 3@H alerted?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: He might as well bid 4@S at once as push partner into a corner and then bid it|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: 3h= trial bid|pg||

nt|Walddk7: If Kopstad bids again over 3@C, he should choose 3@S|pg||

pc|h2|nt|olliebol: not any more i guess|pg||

mb|p|nt|blum1956: It was possible to defend this 1NT - E should have played the @sQ in the 3rd trick|pg||
nt|bvdahl: 3 NT with club lead...?|pg||

nt|blum1956: A small @S lead could be somewhat confusing for the declarer as the club switch looks dangerous|pg||

nt|yo_yo: it's so annoying when the mini NT scores a victory :)|pg||

nt|haans: odds for that|pg||
nt|haans: 3@H to rock the boat|pg||
pc|sT|nt|bvdahl: anyone for balancing 2@H on north's hand?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Balancing is good - but I really hate this 5332 shape and the cards are just wrong|pg||
nt|sharkey: not me - showing my age...|pg||
nt|baardolav: I am balancing|pg||
nt|sharkey: also - pd always shows up with x or xx in @H when I do|pg||
nt|haans: balancing should have a singelton or else pass|pg||
nt|baardolav: if partner have a single heart he would bid first round with his points:)|pg||
nt|bvdahl: I think I would balance. More variance, but I think you'll gain in the long run|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Balancing works here because you can escape for 1 down - but how luvky is it to find partner with 4trump and good fillers, and they cannot ruff a spade?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: Johnny Moen- Olav Hjerkinn is a very experienced pair from Ski BC, both old friends of mine. Tough players as well|pg||
nt|haans: balance and go down what fun it that|pg||
nt|sharkey: Why not bid with S hand - showing Majors?|pg||
nt|haans: couse p would bid 2|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Going down has to be fun - or we would not play :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: After all - pd has some points|pg||
nt|bvdahl: always fun the endplay at trick 11 to make only -500 :)|pg||
nt|bvdahl: to find, I mean|pg||
nt|baardolav: if you will not go down... then you have to go home|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: Odd-Roger Nielsen- Didrik Ueland is among the youngsters in "Tempoknektene", eager for play. Promising pair. |pg||

nt|haans: i would|pg||
nt|bvdahl: one heart|pg||

nt|cuttysark: Hard to visualise a god sacrifice from North - if partner has only 4 clubs it is more like 800|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|blum1956: Again 4NT should be quantitative in my mind|pg||
nt|rmb1: It seems difficult to find both members of a partnership agreeing 4NT is quantitative|pg||

pc|hA|nt|lestergold: an argument for taking insurance an bidding the 'phantom' here|pg||
pc|h4|nt|blum1956: And that is a problem for E as he/she has  good hand but no aces. The problem was solved by answering some kind of Blackwood, I guess|pg||

nt|bvdahl: I think with 5@c in north's hand it is possible to get -4 with a singleton @d lead|pg||
nt|sharkey: rite Baard|pg||
nt|lestergold: my experience here is that they probab;y make 4@s when you have so much in partner's long suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: there is alaso the arguiment is taht god gace you a singleton in order to lead it for a ruff|pg||

nt|yo_yo: i sympathize with that bid but I cant see it making|pg||
nt|yo_yo: this is getting murky|pg||
mb|d|mb|2N|nt|blum1956: After W did not bid any number of diamonds E may lead a club wich gives declarer a chance|pg||
mb|d|nt|haans: swinging the hammer|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i hope he didnt bid it in annoyance at the last hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: no skweeze|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: sry - he has not|pg||
nt|bvdahl: You can consider bidding 4 NT over pd's x|pg||
mb|p|nt|olliebol: bidding is going out of hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|bvdahl: ha can see a cl ruff for pd now|pg||
nt|bvdahl: @C ruff|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i think the double was penalty suggestion|pg||
pc|s4|nt|lestergold: very unlucky this 4/1 spade break|pg||
nt|yo_yo: not take out|pg||
nt|olliebol: it was opening and clubs |pg||
pc|s2|nt|haans: MP the land of doubles|pg||
nt|cuttysark: It does seem odd never to mention your 5-5 fit|pg||
pc|s9|nt|blum1956: I think @sA is the best percentage play|pg||

pc|s6|pg||
nt|blum1956: This time lucky double|pg||
pc|sK|nt|haans: sqz in spade and dim|pg||

nt|sharkey: +200 may pay well though|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|olliebol: but due to clubs 33 dec can come to 7 tricks if def doesnt find @d shift|pg||
nt|yo_yo: has Ingunn suggested @C the way she played @S?|pg||
pc|d4|nt|bvdahl: the x cannot be based on spades. Seem likely that E has at least 4 card support in one minor|pg||
nt|bvdahl: yes, the result will probably be ok|pg||
pc|h7|pc|sT|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jbgood: overtrick coming in|pg||

nt|blum1956: well, still this is MP's so one should not blame the declarer much for his play hoping for good distribution of the adverse honors|pg||
nt|bvdahl: 4 h's make EW it seems|pg||
nt|cuttysark: This deal does not look like fun|pg||
nt|yo_yo: -200   "the kiss of death"|pg||

nt|blum1956: 5@c is makeable while 3NT not|pg||

mb|p|nt|frankaus: some unauthored info now|pg||

nt|lestergold: here the wjo helped them reah a game they may not have reached|pg||
mb|p|pc|cA|nt|haans: weak NT at its best in MP land|pg||
nt|rmb1: Spec asks "why not 3@C" because diamonds are so much better and partner did not negative double|pg||
nt|bvdahl: hehe, not so hard, it seems|pg||
nt|haans: rite u r|pg||
nt|haans: not even Rekstad can understand he have 2 aces|pg||
nt|bvdahl: 4 cl makes EW|pg||
nt|olliebol: is this a mixed raise?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ah they had a bid available|pg||
pc|c2|nt|rmb1: @S is a better 7 card "fit" because they break 3-3|pg||
pc|c8|nt|haans: best lead for decl :)|pg||
nt|bvdahl: not so much to the play. Should be 10, not more not less|pg||
nt|haans: hurrah|pg||
nt|haans: but i see 5|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|haans: best MP contract|pg||
nt|olliebol: i think so a little bit preemptive plus some defence|pg||
pc|cK|nt|bvdahl: yes|pg||
pc|c4|nt|blum1956: 3@c id not what N likes to hear from S. Still he bids a game which will go down|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Tore what was 3@D?|pg||
pc|c7|nt|haans: 60 hcp out|pg||
nt|bvdahl: not sure I agree|pg||
nt|bvdahl: I think E has shown his hand after the x|pg||
nt|haans: was dynamic biddin|pg||
nt|yo_yo: surely they will reach game, opening bid + opening bid = game|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4@h off probably|pg||
pc|s3|pg||

pc|sA|nt|yo_yo: which is obviously is|pg||
pc|s6|nt|haans: last word: elektron78: lol...H ruff|pg||

pc|s2|pc|s8|pg||
pc|s4|nt|haans: and can enter with @H9|pg||
nt|bvdahl: yes, but presumably 3D showed a decent hand since he didn't use lebensohl|pg||
nt|bvdahl: amd then showed more with x|pg||
nt|cuttysark: A spade now will certainly take it off|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|pc|s9|pg||
nt|haans: and more for 5@C|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c9|pc|h5|nt|bvdahl: too much, perhaps.. :)|pg||

pc|cQ|pc|s7|nt|haans: still no spade trick to them|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
mc|11|nt|yo_yo: Feness unlikely to lead @S when his partner bids @C|pg||

nt|lestergold: what! still bidding|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|haans: let them kontinue spade|pg||

nt|haans: did assume 4@H as que|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: she won at last!:)|pg||

pc|sA|nt|yo_yo: rather feness than me playing this hand!|pg||
nt|haans: that 2nt not good bridge|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: 2N = forcing|pg||

pc|s9|pg||

nt|yo_yo: joanna lumley in the land of the northern lights|pg||
nt|olliebol: i guess he will invite|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|s3|nt|rmb1: 6@S needs @HA onside.  But will NS get in their way|pg||
nt|blum1956: Ron Klinger calls it 5-loser hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: Alert on N 1.p|pg||
nt|olliebol: both pass and three no look a little bit extreme but there you go|pg||
pc|s5|nt|blum1956: After E did not pass 2@d W may bid 3NT|pg||

pc|s2|nt|rmb1: How many losers does he call East's hand|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sK|nt|blum1956: E cannot be sure that W's hearts are not leaded by the Q|pg||
nt|rmb1: Should make|pg||
nt|blum1956: Only 15 HCP missing so @hQ is almost surely with S. No problem in the 2nd trixk for the declarer|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ugh|pg||
pc|s7|nt|rmb1: How he wants 4NT artificial|pg||
nt|bvdahl: need D ruff to set 4 spades here|pg||
nt|yo_yo: this time the lady might get a verbal reprimand :)|pg||
pc|c5|nt|haans: not that hard |pg||
pc|s4|nt|rmb1: 5@H asking for @H control?|pg||

pc|d3|pc|d7|nt|haans: @C2 = even|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|blum1956: probably for @sQ|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|s6|nt|blum1956: (if the !Q were with N, the declarer should take the second trick with the @hK and play the @sK|pg||
nt|olliebol: @s 44 and @d 32 means nine now|pg||
pc|h4|pc|sT|nt|haans: :(|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|c2|nt|haans: i would have played Q on the QA lead = Q = i have J or it was singel|pg||
nt|haans: dark night|pg||

nt|haans: hi all welcome|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Last board today|pg||
nt|bvdahl: so he could have just played the Q after pulling trumps. Either N has A stiff, or S has it which creates entry to dummy|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Many thanks to Tore Farbrot, operator and organizer. Well done!|pg||
nt|haans: :) We´ll meet again :) bye all|pg||

mb|2H|nt|vugraphzpu: Har prøvd alt, hans PC for moderne, får ingen internet- linje opp.:(|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|blum1956: The declarer should have ruffed a club, discarded two clubs on diamonds and then play a heart to the Ace using the chance that @hA is singleton with N|pg||
nt|haans: @DJ wrong|pg||
nt|bvdahl: yes, that is what makes it interesting ;)|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Bak at 10.10 local time tomorrow|pg||

pc|h5|nt|bvdahl: I know|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|pg||

pc|c3|pc|cQ|nt|blum1956: hi|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pg||
nt|yo_yo: agree,  West could have rubbish ?|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hJ|pc|hT|nt|bvdahl: good score for EW I think|pg||
nt|haans: handle spade good|pg||
nt|bvdahl: yes. A heart shift would have been better|pg||
nt|haans: or lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: Last: 3 s jump are shortage. Normaly with 3 h|pg||
nt|bvdahl: South should ask himself if W would bid 3 NT with only the ace of spades...|pg||
nt|haans: agree|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: Nxt rnd with Brown- Bang as are sitting steady NS, and Buer- Strand, 3. pl so far EW. They are clever players from Hurdal/ Jessheim. Now 3 pairs are in front, 4. a godd part ...|pg||

nt|blum1956: the club misguess costed a lot|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: Actualy W played c to A and finessed h 10! |pg||
nt|olliebol: but they can have the understanding that direct bidding is a sound hand|pg||
nt|olliebol: ok so far these round ladies and gentleman|pg||
nt|yo_yo: thanks Ollie & Tore|pg||
nt|olliebol: big tx to Tore and Kath|pg||
nt|yo_yo: do we know who is leading?|pg||
nt|olliebol: and of course to bbo and the organisers of this tournament|pg||
nt|vugraphzpu: Very fast playing, 7+ min left before next rnd. The leader list is Feness- Kopstad +200, Uran- Harr +176 and Hansen- Haraldsen +177, then p 36 4 37 10 41 |pg||
nt|olliebol: so its a three horse race|pg||
