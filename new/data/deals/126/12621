nt|chmitty: they signal with the 2nd highest card|pg||
nt|lestergold: we know that there are often ambiguities in this position even wit a reg pard|pg||

nt|lestergold: well is ther any other hope in any case?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Fantoni must be maximum for his leap to 3NT opposite a 2@H range asking|pg||
nt|lestergold: shouldnt on the lead be suit preference priority is to show information in the known long asuit buid and led|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1NT in the balancing seat shows 11-15 for them|pg||

nt|lestergold: in these situations especially part score I do not automatically lead partner's suit when I hold A or K unsupported |pg||

nt|lestergold: another of your beloved 20/20s Rolan!!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, pass it out|pg||
nt|chmitty: :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That would be 3 IMPs to Zimmermann|pg||
nt|lestergold: well this is a more genuine candidate for a pass out|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Are they going to listen now?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No|pg||
nt|lestergold: west will open nv|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nunes can open 2@H 10-13 5+ cards in their methods|pg||
nt|lestergold: he likes his spades and his shape|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Ah, 2@H would also show an unbalanced hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So he needs a singleton or void|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: fantoni goes to pie|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: to what??  lol|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|d|mb|2S|nt|Walddk2: EW might have won the board now|pg||

mb|3C|mb|p|nt|chmitty: not so sure|pg||
nt|lestergold: Nubes unlike closed room doesnt wait for auction to fizzle out|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Fantoni will bid but will let him play there?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: yes|pg||
nt|chmitty: if Fantoni is let to play in 3@c he has a lot of reasons to make 9 triks|pg||
pc|s4|nt|Walddk2: That's also my guess|pg||
nt|lestergold: I think very good chance that he will get the clubs right|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sJ|pc|s6|pg||
nt|lestergold: west is odds on to have short club|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s5|pc|s2|pc|sA|pg||
nt|chmitty: East final pass probably denies 4 cards in @d ... so fantoni already knows 4@s + 5@d by West|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|nt|chmitty: and he can test the @h|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He is but could just as well be 4252|pg||

nt|vugraphzxr: je vous rappelle que se sont les 1/2 finales de la DN1 open |pg||
nt|djneill: bonjour laure|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: Bonjour, Hi|pg||
nt|djneill: semifiinals, sorry|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: :)|pg||
nt|djneill: welcome all, if you don't know, North-South are one of the top 3 pairs in the world, if you ask anyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: the two semi finals are : zimmerman - delfour and Laffineur- Chemla|pg||
nt|djneill: ok great thanks laure|pg||
nt|djneill: Zimmerman will be appearing in the NEC cup in a few weeks, with fantoni-nunes and balicki-zmudzinski on board|pg||
nt|djneill: so this is just a warm-up|pg||
pc|c3|pc|sQ|pc|s9|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4252 not possible as that would give East 44 in the majors, and he would have responded 1@H|pg||
nt|chmitty: true :) so ....|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dJ|pc|d6|pc|dT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We do appreciate private messages, but if you could keep it to less than 100 a minute, it would be nice|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: Guilaumin has a club in his hand|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d8|pc|d4|pc|c4|pg||
nt|chmitty: he has to take the direct finesse|pg||
nt|lestergold: if now he plays three rounds of hearts he will have count|pg||
nt|lestergold: has risks of course|pg||
nt|chmitty: that would be one off Roland|pg||
nt|chmitty: final uppercut|pg||
nt|chmitty: he has to mahe his decision after @h ace|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes doesnt work of course|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c2|pc|cK|nt|chmitty: I believe he is going to play K@h @h to the ace, then @c10 ... and think|pg||

nt|chmitty: so ... Roland I could not find if they play extra boards or not|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: and the last !!!!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Merci Laure, you were great!|pg||
nt|chmitty: @h |pg||
nt|lestergold: you were wrong west started the bidding and west gained|pg||
mb|1S|nt|vugraphzxr: Is not finish on the other room|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|lestergold: and e/w were always likely to gain in this auction|pg||
nt|lestergold: /hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|djneill: East bids 1@s over North's 1@h, which must not promise 5+@s, maybe X then would just show "something" but no other convenient bid|pg||
nt|chmitty: can he make 9 tricks ?|pg||
nt|lestergold: as they make 2 or 3 in the master suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If he makes this, we have a tie|pg||
pc|d5|nt|chmitty: 9 he can't ... he has to make 8 to tie the match|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We don't know how many extra boards they will be playing|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dT|pc|dK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and we don't know if we have a file or not|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am not optimistic I must confess|pg||
pc|s2|nt|vugraphzxr: And the last board|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sA|nt|djneill: South's 3@d was just noise saying "I wasn't completely broke but I'm not maximum"|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sQ|pc|sK|nt|djneill: North was suprisingly restrained, at imps - but 6 losers - if South could cover 3 South would have accepted game|pg||
nt|djneill: if E-W don't attack @s they will not get any... going away on the @d's|pg||
nt|djneill: East's club lead should indicate length (maybe lowest from odd number) so Weset might find the switch|pg||
nt|djneill: West knows any @d honors are working for North|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: i remind you 3 segments of 16 boards for the semi final|pg||
nt|djneill: West can hope to get 1@c, 1@h, but at most 1 @d, needs to set it so needs to switch now|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|djneill: yes thanks Laure, this is a bad score, but just the first of three segments|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s6|pc|d3|pg||

pc|dQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He is not home just yet|pg||
nt|lestergold: this is not laydown|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|nt|lestergold: could be double part swing|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What a thriller this has been|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3000 specs will agree|pg||

nt|lestergold: i mean double part score going down swing|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h7|pc|h3|nt|djneill: West still has a shot, if he can ruff the 3rd @d if East switches to @s in time, but North is playing well here - East is marked for @cK and now @dK, so likely West has @hQ|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|chmitty: well done :)|pg||

pc|c6|pc|cK|nt|djneill: Zimmerman appears next Feb. 9 in the NEC cup with Fantoni-Nunes and Balicki-Zmudzinski in tow, should be exciting|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|djneill: Fantoni used the @d suit to locate the @hQ and also be a little stealthy - if E-W think North does not have the @dA, then they may be reluctant to play @s - it's good to be Fantoni|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: BYe every body i will see you in few minutes (10 for be precise)|pg||
nt|djneill: ok thanks all, next segment starts in the next several minutes|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: see you soon :)|pg||
nt|djneill: ciao, I mean au revoir|pg||
nt|po-s: does anyone know if Zimmermann is aiming for the French team in Ostend?|pg||
nt|po-s: or who has been selected...|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: the french selection had already start and zimmernan will begin in1/4 final|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe they count total points|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: ....|pg||
nt|lestergold: well got a bullseye there|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We are in the dark as much as you are, specs|pg||
nt|chmitty: Laure any idea of waht is going on now ?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And there is still that ruling on board 3|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: so|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: i will stay here|pg||
nt|chmitty: @h merci|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: and i wil bring you some news|pg||
nt|Walddk2: There is an appeal I am told|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: when i get it |pg||
mc|8|nt|rodal f: Onliest thing to say is that childs should have been away from the table by some board:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So presumably the director has made a ruling|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and someone has appealed|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Board 3 it was|pg||
nt|Walddk2: When 6NT made although NS had two aces|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: in french sorry|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: Points totaux|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thats OK|pg||
nt|chmitty: I'm told by one of our top french directors that they count total points|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Ah, total points they count|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: so i wil wait with you|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't like the idea of total points, but I am not an organiser in Paris|pg||
nt|lestergold: that sounds liekm acontradiction in terms.. organiser in paris ... sorry just joking....|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I mean, the final will start 10:30 tomorrow, and it's 20:50 now. It's not that there isn't enough time to play extra boards|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We are 2100 idiots looking at a blank screen. Not sure if there is a remedy|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2099 if you please dont include me|pg||
nt|chmitty: I'm told that, in case there is an appeal, and the appeal does not change the ruling, it would be 8 extra boards nevertheless|pg||
nt|chmitty: while if there is no appeal, it is total points count :) strange ??|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We can't go into detail regarding board 3, because we don't know which explanation was wrong, if any|pg||
nt|chmitty: for sure, 4NT was explained as a RKC blackwood on one side of the screen, and natural on the other side|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They are counting total points like mad now one would assume|pg||
nt|chmitty: Last news : there is an appeal :) so it's gone to take some time|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We are French but not completely mad, says a spectator. No comment|pg||
nt|lestergold: well i will bid you all goodnight thx to my big chief Roland and thx to exc operator but above all thx to the many alert and expert specs who have made this session particularly ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: enjoyable|pg||
nt|chmitty: and after the appeal, in case the score stays as it is nox, 8 more boards|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So there is time to create a file if they want|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I doubt that they have one|pg||
nt|chmitty: but they are good organizers :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thanks Mike|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: qo|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: so|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: on point total delfour wins but !!!|pg||
nt|chmitty: delfour ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: zimmerman fait appel|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: no|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: pour le moment delfourn a pas gagné|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What was the rulling on board 3, Laure?|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: il y a une commission d'appel|pg||
nt|chmitty: We don't know, Roland, they are in the appeal room|pg||
nt|Walddk2: There must be a ruling|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They can't hear an appeal without a ruling|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: dont worry i m staying with you!!!|pg||
nt|chmitty: As Zimmermann is not happy with it, it must be that the score stays|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This can take time|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think you can walk your turtle, safely|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Is it a tie I am asked. hrmpfff¤|pg||
nt|Walddk2: en teidä miksen kääntänyt jätkää, says a Finnish spectator and he is right too|pg||
nt|Walddk2: For new specs. We have a tie, but an appeal is being heard. If the director's ruling is upheld, they are going to play 9 extra boards. We do not know when though. Between now and ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: midnight is my guess|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's 21:05 in Paris now|pg||
nt|chmitty: Now, you can understand Fantoni's point of view on board 3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 8 extra boards|pg||
nt|chmitty: if 4NT was alerted RKC to him, difficult to imagine they play deliberately 6NT with 2 missing aces|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We do not know why N-S were unhappy with board 3 (other than they did not defeat it)|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: ca discute|pg||
nt|chmitty: Ok ... I'm asked lot of questions and I answer in French|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Marshall will translate I hope|pg||
nt|chmitty: 4SA a probablement été alerté comme Blackwood par EST, qui est ducôté de FAntoni deriière le paravent|pg||
nt|marlowepi: ok i will|pg||
nt|chmitty: et 5SA alerté comme un blackwood aux rois|pg||
nt|chmitty: alors que Guillaumin a fait des enchères quantitatives naturelles|pg||
nt|chmitty: Maintenant, Fantoni peut aussi penser en voyant son as de @s et le roi au mort que 4SA n'était pas blackwood|pg||
nt|chmitty: et il aurait du se méfier|pg||
nt|chmitty: je pense que la commission laissera le résultat :) mais je prends des risues|pg||
nt|Walddk2: L'important dans la vie ce n'est point le triomphe, mais le combat, l'essentiel ce n'est pas d'avoir vaincu mais de s'être bien battu|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: ca discute severe|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Always remember that :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The important thing in life is not the triumph but the struggle, the essential thing is not to have conquered but to have fought well|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If 5NT is a grand slam try, Fantoni knows that things have gone wrong for them|pg||
nt|chmitty: of course|pg||
nt|chmitty: that's why I believe the ruling will not be changed :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Meanwhile, I can explain the rules of cricket if you wish :)|pg||
nt|chmitty: please do ... does it take all night long ?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You have two sides, one out in the field and one in. Each man that's in the side that's in goes out, and when he's out he comes in and the next man goes in until he's out. When ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: they are all out, the side that's out comes in and the side thats been in goes out and tries to get those coming in, out. Sometimes you get men still in and not out. That happens ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: when the captain of the batting side decides to declare the innings.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: When a man goes out to go in, the men who are out try to get him out, and when he is out he goes in and the next man in goes out and goes in. There are two men called umpires who ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: stay all out all the time and they decide when the men who are in are out. When both sides have been in and all the men have been out, and both sides have been out twice after all ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: the men have been in, including those who are not out, that is the end of the game!|pg||
