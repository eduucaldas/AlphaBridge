nt|finch: EW are one of the world's slowest pairs, so don't expect the play to go very fast|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rhelle: 2NT is top heavy in this sequence, since EW play effectively a 13-15 NT|pg||
nt|rhelle: so they pass balanced 12 counts if they are bad|pg||
nt|rhelle: no easy lead for North - may well start with a @d|pg||
nt|danilo1: would 3@H be sign-off?|pg||
nt|roswolf: i fancy a black suit|pg||
nt|rhelle: I'm not sure|pg||
pc|d3|nt|roswolf: well predicted rob|pg||

pc|h2|pc|hA|pc|h6|pc|h9|pg||
nt|finch: As long as NS start on clubs either now or after winning the next heart this is going off|pg||
nt|finch: They can't afford to defend passively for too many tricks|pg||
nt|rhelle: Yes, and with the singletom King in dummy, that's not hard to find|pg||
nt|dburn: true - if one defends passively for too many tricks, one may find that there aren't any tricks left|pg||
nt|roswolf: true|pg||
nt|rhelle: one indeed runs that risk, one does :)|pg||
nt|dburn: one can imagine a BOLS Bridge Tip - don't defend passively at trick twelve|pg||
nt|danilo1: @C10 easier from South, but @S J is good as well .. 2@S + 3@H + @CA |pg||

nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|roswolf: frisky auction in the other room|pg||
nt|finch: I'm not sure where West thought he was getting four defensive tricks from in the other room|pg||
nt|dburn: odd business in the other room - West seems to have doubled 4@h when it was not clear that he should double 7@h|pg||
nt|rhelle: true - even so, 4@h is a HE-MAN bid|pg||
nt|danilo1: this may be big swing ... 4@S only -1|pg||
nt|finch: He knows the 4@H was a guess, but there's nothing about his hand that suggests it's going off|pg||
nt|roswolf: TARZAN club|pg||
mb|4H|nt|rhelle: here everyone knows that West is limited to 15, so that makes bidding much easier|pg||
nt|roswolf: and here the same action|pg||
nt|dburn: if West does bid 4@s, as well he might, North will have a close decision|pg||
mb|4S|nt|rhelle: Yes, but the inference may be different - against a normal system bidding is much riskier|pg||
nt|dburn: unless he plays double as "I would like to bid 5@h but I don't mind defending"|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|finch: 5@D must show heart support from North. He can't otherwise have a hand that passed over 1@S and now wants to bid.|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|dburn: but he felt strongly enough about driving to 5@h that he bid 5@d on the way|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|finch: South may be thinking of his @CAQ when he converts to hearts - correctly|pg||
nt|danilo1: but 5@H will make ... West (on lead and in trick with @HK) cannot play @C ... so @C is going to be discarded on @D ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: 5@H good view but no cigar|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|rhelle: The only lead to beat it would be the @dK :)|pg||

mb|1N!|mb|p|nt|dburn: haven't seen Bauke play this fast in ages - mind you, there is not all that much at stake in the match|pg||

nt|rhelle: actually, there is - they may well play each other in the rest of the tourney|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|rhelle: and the carry-over is important|pg||
nt|rhelle: their NT is 12.5 - 15; they pass bad 12 counts|pg||
nt|dburn: although looking at the table, I suppose that if either team suffered a serious walloping they could be in jeopardy|pg||

nt|finch: Even with all of that, it's not easy: two rounds of trumps, two diamonds, trump to hand|pg||

nt|sybarra: 3 @D cue? or?|pg||
nt|sybarra: ty Rob |pg||
nt|danilo1: if East now bids 3@S ... following 4@C may be key-cue|pg||
nt|danilo1: *following 4@D|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is wqhere a relay system comes into its own|pg||
nt|rhelle: so East will think this over - he has a minimum 1@c opening, but the hands fit perfectly|pg||
nt|rhelle: he knows partner has 9-11 points,|pg||
nt|rhelle: so it's just if they are in the right place|pg||
nt|finch: if West has x Kxxx Axx Q9xxx then even 5@C is in jeopardy. It is very hard to bid this type of slam|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|nt|finch: Most slams have some high cards somewhere that aren't working|pg||
nt|finch: I suppose even this one has the @CJ and @SQ wasted|pg||
mb|4D!|nt|rhelle: I'm not sure what 4@c is|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|roswolf: true|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: DONR THINK SOUTH BID AT THIS LEVEL|pg||
nt|sybarra: not red anyway |pg||
mb|4N|nt|rhelle: If I have to hazrad a guess, I think 4@c means that he wants to know if West has concentrated strength|pg||
nt|vugraphzwa: sorry i am flying|pg||
nt|rhelle: as they are in a GF situation|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@D == yes or no?|pg||
nt|finch: Unless 4@C was keycard, given the shapes are known?|pg||
nt|rhelle: 4NT would be a great hand without anything in @s|pg||
nt|rhelle: so now East has to decide |pg||
nt|sybarra: so if he had @S's he would bid @S?|pg||
nt|rhelle: no, he has already shown a singleton @s|pg||
nt|danilo1: could East see West's distribution via relays?|pg||
nt|rhelle: but he denies a singleton honour|pg||
nt|rhelle: the point of the hand is no asted values in @h|pg||
nt|rhelle: wasted|pg||
nt|rhelle: and I think 4NT may well be the key bid - my money is on East bidding it|pg||
nt|danilo1: can he ask for cue-biding after worked out distribution?|pg||
nt|rhelle: that's what he did - see above|pg||
nt|sybarra: clearly we know it is E  thinking,  ......tray is in East court|pg||
nt|rhelle: interesting point ... he doesn't need the @cQ of course|pg||
nt|danilo1: s, than 2 @D cues should be enough ... if West no @CQ, may still have 5 @C, and for the worse, on @C finess|pg||
