nt|cindy:  W should be able to recognize that|pg||
nt|marlowepi: which means W  must lead a red non-ace|pg||
nt|cindy:  theyve fallen asleep   i hear crickets|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W might well lead a trump against 4H, but he also might play E for a stiff spade and a trump entry, and lead a spade, inwhich case 4H is easy|pg||

mb|p|nt|othered1: rehi, everyone!|pg||

nt|mamos: game for ew|pg||
nt|mamos: although North doesnt think so|pg||
mb|2N|nt|andyv:  Hi Deyan:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzym: that 3@D bid gives chance to EW to find the 5@D save|pg||

mb|3H|mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Roberto Martínez|pg||
nt|ybob: Hi all :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: Hello, Roberto|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: although 4@S is a bit double dummy|pg||
nt|othered1: normal auction, so far, good suit in south making up for 1/2 point high card shortness|pg||
nt|andyv:  I think S hand worth more than an invite|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: Welcome back to Rado Radev|pg||
nt|rado: hello:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: Hello, Rado|pg||
mb|p|nt|ybob: Hi Deyan|pg||
nt|andyv:  they may be pushed into it... although it looks like NS are out of ammo|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@s looks too expensive now|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: he can make 4@S |pg||
pc|s6|nt|vugraphzym: has to play small @C to earn an entry|pg||
nt|andyv:  2N is a mp bid|pg||
pc|sT|nt|Walddk4: Hello Ed and Andy|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and Deyan, our operator|pg||
nt|othered1: west reasonably passed over 1N.  Not sure if it was judgment or a systemic lack of an appropriate call (i.e., double has a conventional meaning)|pg||
nt|othered1: HI, Roland!|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: Hi, Roland|pg||
nt|andyv:  good morning everyone|pg||
nt|andyv:  but N sees losing the first 3 tricks and still not sure where rest of tricks are coming from|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: good part score for EW|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: N can make 6@S and 4@C |pg||
pc|sJ|nt|andyv:  as it turns out|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|ybob: nice bid 3@S :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: looks like it can make|pg||
nt|othered1: I don't agree.  depends on actual 1N range and non-vul considerations aren't all that different from matchpoints.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|othered1: Hi, Andy!|pg||

pc|d4|nt|andyv:  this hand going painfully slow...and I can imagine NS not happy the way things are unwrapping|pg||
nt|andyv:  i don't need that excuse Mike:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  looks like E may have trapped himself in his hand and was unable to get @hs started?|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: yes at the end he had to play A@H and a @H|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: but I didnt understand how that happened|pg||
nt|lestergold: My geography was not my best subject at school could you enlighten me as to which countries these respective teams belong to?|pg||

pc|s4|pg||

mb|2N|mb|p|nt|rado: 2NT natural FG with extras since 3NT would be minimum FG|pg||
mb|3D|nt|cindy:  East doing good to not reveal big club fit|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|cindy:  they can be outbid so why help the opps with more info|pg||

mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5N|an|even KC with void|nt|rado: S had minimum hand for the opening so quiet 4@h|pg||
nt|cindy:  5N shows two and a void|pg||
nt|rado: an 5NT 2 KC + void|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not sure about that pass by E. 5C puts on a lot of pressure as S has not named a suit yet and 4N is by passed|pg||
nt|rado: 6@C Q trump ask maybe now|pg||
nt|cindy:  yeh, i agree marshall   5@c or pass giving away no info|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: of course the number could be huge but 2220 is a pretty big number too, so is 1440|pg||
mb|7H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rado: from N's cards S must have all missing honours outside his void to have opening|pg||
nt|cindy:  unlikely N is ever doing anything but bidding a grand anyway|pg||
pc|c6|nt|marlowepi: from E point of view game NS is 95% so put the scimitar to their throats|pg||
nt|rado: just placing 16-17 HCP in 3 suit|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|h4|pc|h5|mc|13|nt|marlowepi: that may be true but doesnt affect the bidding decision that E faces|pg||

nt|Walddk4: N-S  Romania    E-W  Bulgaria|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: Stara Zagora is the organiser of the event.It is in Bulgaria. And the other team is from Buchurest (Romania)|pg||
nt|lestergold: thx Roland|pg||
nt|andyv:  3N looks playable for EW|pg||
nt|star6ija: nice distribution|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzym: EW are playing precision|pg||
nt|star6ija: 7@c is possible, but...|pg||
nt|mamos: grand certainly looks a possibility|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: he put 1NT and then changed it :)|pg||
nt|othered1: Dayan, do you know their NT opening ranges?|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: I think it is 15-17|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|vugraphzym: 2@C should be @S and another suit|pg||
mb|1H|nt|rado: W has minimum neg dbl here|pg||
nt|othered1: this should go very quickly -- you have a 20-count and partner jump supports  you . . . |pg||
nt|andyv:  AQ10xx suit will almost always produce 4 tricks and 5 tricks a good portion of the time|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: 3N by West probable diamond lead and no sweat|pg||
nt|andyv:  if 2N is invite, it is a heavy one|pg||
nt|andyv:  but, matter of style, I guess... I like being aggressive with those hands.|pg||
mb|4C!|nt|star6ija: as Roberto pointed out the timing is very important in such boards - as we like to say in Bulgaria "1 second careless = dead for the rest of your life" :)|pg||
nt|rado: E has a choise rebiding weak @H, 3 cards 2@S or upgrading to 2NT protekting minor Kings|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Good morning to Ed Shapiro|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S!|nt|andyv:  wow....wonderful!!!|pg||
nt|andyv:  oops:)|pg||
nt|othered1: 4@S?  |pg||
nt|othered1: Fast arrival?|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: 2NT should be invitational hand yes|pg||
nt|rado: hi Ed|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, everyone, from chilly central Pennsylvania, USA|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: Hi, Ed|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  good morning everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: Good morning, Andy|pg||
nt|andyv:  E sequence usually reserved for hands that are just short of game forcing  bids|pg||
nt|lestergold: any lead except a club helps and no one is kicking off with the stiff club ace|pg||
nt|star6ija: this 2@s bid from S is not good option... in this vulnerability strong club has to be sa descriptive as quickly as possible|pg||
nt|mamos: have Ns agreed a suit?|pg||
nt|star6ija: @Ss? :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: I think 1@C is natural, star6i|pg||
nt|mamos: was 1@C strong or nat?|pg||
nt|star6ija: if so ok|pg||
nt|andyv:  NS sure have a lot of points on this hand|pg||
nt|othered1: Agree for playinig for 9 tricks.  But it's likely you'll be playing for 10 in @H with flat hand v. flat hand|pg||
nt|othered1: 7N is off the top and playing 7 elsewhere is just running risk|pg||
nt|andyv:  then bid 2@c and jump to 3N;)|pg||
nt|othered1: That's the auction you find in the post-mortem, but not at the table by either the players or commentators.|pg||
mb|5N!|nt|lestergold: even a spade lead sets up a spade trick for declarer|pg||
nt|andyv:  Ed, ever have hands where you just have too many bids?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ybob: :)|pg||
nt|star6ija: theyare trying to strike back immediately|pg||
nt|othered1: very rarely, but in my partnerships (the few that remain) we define things very tightly.|pg||
nt|andyv:  the N hand would give me a headache here|pg||
nt|othered1: 5N?  2 keys, plus Q, plus void?|pg||
nt|andyv:  looks like it|pg||
mb|6C!|mb|p|nt|sharkey: Good morning|pg||
nt|andyv:  this auction will run out of steam quickly|pg||
nt|mamos: North thinks it's Hearts :)|pg||
nt|star6ija: 7@cs depends on some precautions which should've benn made by declarer|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: it will be interesting if 6@H are bid wheather E will double :)|pg||
mb|6D!|mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Hello Andy and Carl|pg||
nt|andyv:  Hi Carl and roland|pg||
nt|ybob: down 2 AK @S low @C , later ruff @S|pg||
nt|andyv:  3@s would have set trump and asked for cue bids|pg||
nt|mamos: ugh|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: 7@S* looks the minimax|pg||
nt|mamos: well it makes but this has not been a good auction imho|pg||
nt|star6ija: 12 tricks are easy|pg||
nt|othered1: I like the 1@H response, to get a natural rebid from partner.|pg||
mb|7H|nt|andyv:  all roads lead to 9 tricks, Mike? :))|pg||
nt|othered1: second best spot, but safe here.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  they got there.... good thing this isn'|pg||
nt|andyv:  isn't a BAM event:)|pg||
pc|dT|nt|andyv:  and Deyan:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: it didnt run out of steam that quickly :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  they decided to bring it to a boil:)|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - this auction not for the faint hearted...|pg||
nt|andyv:  so, the question is why E didn't simply open 4@s if that was what he was intending to bid all the time?|pg||
nt|lestergold: well ironically a club lead and declarer has to do abit of guesswork|pg||
nt|andyv:  probably no over tricks|pg||
nt|rado: lack of communications between NS will help declare for 8 tricks|pg||
nt|othered1: this will claim as soon as both follow to one trump|pg||
pc|d2|nt|andyv:  this can go down 500 easily|pg||
nt|ybob: 4/2 @S shows even and interest @C|pg||
nt|star6ija: but @d now will bring the contract home|pg||
nt|othered1: Right -- a hand worth 2@C in playing strength but with inadequate high cards for the call.|pg||
nt|othered1: maybe even 9|pg||
nt|rado: sure with @S suit favourable|pg||
pc|d3|nt|othered1: I thought that was standard, but east's action here is what I see regularly at the table.  Times changed, I guess.|pg||

mc|13|nt|andyv:  I don't think so Ed.|pg||

nt|lestergold: well South should be content with 2H his pard hasnt made an unassuming cue bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: n/s too high at 2H!|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6 losers 2 spades 2 dims a club and a dim ruff|pg||
nt|lestergold: admittedly north's raise with two trumps and a collection of quacks under the openiong bid wa pretty pointless|pg||
nt|andyv:  true|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: 3@C a relay?|pg||

nt|lestergold: you pass with north because you o not want to see pard's expression when you table that as dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: N thought for a long time and passed|pg||
nt|lestergold: and his partner could be splinering as it was it was close to a splinter|pg||
nt|ybob: 5@H = 300 |pg||

mb|p|nt|andyv:  N 1N opener hit pay dirt|pg||
nt|sharkey: "looks like 1 NT - open 1 NT"|pg||
nt|andyv:  agree... i like 1N with N cards....too awkward to describe hand if you open 1@D|pg||
nt|sharkey: Leromain picked up another 5 IMPs when W opened 1 NT in OR and played there|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: he just claimed|pg||
nt|ybob: 2@H = 5+ @H  13/16 pts |pg||
nt|ybob: WOW|pg||
nt|othered1: but it's a good one, I think|pg||
nt|andyv:  gave up a club trick so I'm no so sure how good it is|pg||
nt|othered1: gave up a trick?|pg||
nt|andyv:  it hasn't yet but it's frozen the suit so N can never lead it|pg||
nt|othered1: What other lead beats it?  South wins @D and plays another @C before east can drive last @S, no?|pg||
nt|andyv:  now E can play the hand straight up|pg||
nt|mamos: 43 imps have changed hand son Boards 1-3 so -300 may be the flattest board yet|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: you can go down in 5@S|pg||
nt|ybob: defeat 5@S|pg||
nt|andyv:  7@c great contract except for 4-1 break|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: and still you can make |pg||
nt|othered1: very careful auction by west.  an immediate 6N, just quantitative, would appeal to many|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes|pg||
mb|4D|nt|othered1: Nice pass by east, for play in @D, but 3N is there for the taking.|pg||
nt|lestergold: well this is 2 off at least|pg||
nt|ybob: good lead|pg||
nt|rado: yes due unvaourable trump break|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  all 7@c requires is 1 @s ruff|pg||
mb|4N|nt|sharkey: in my book N hand a clear 1 NT opener|pg||
nt|lestergold: a trump lead would have been  reasonably murderous|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: It's good to have very tight agreements when  you embark on an auction like west's.|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|othered1: is 4N a sign-off?|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: looks like RKCB|pg||
nt|othered1: coiuld be, or west could be cue-bidding in rank order.|pg||
mb|5S|nt|othered1: what, then, is 5@S?|pg||
mb|d|nt|othered1: playing K may mislead south|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't think anything else beats it... I just don't understand leading from Jx of a minor when pd has opened a major.  Why not lead pd's suit?|pg||
nt|othered1: inspiration counts|pg||
nt|andyv:  it would also make me open suits that I don't want the lead because I know pd will never lead my suit:)|pg||
nt|othered1: I don't hate that lead at all.  South does have enough @H length that he might decide to try to attack elsewhre|pg||
nt|andyv:  would you hate the lead if the club honors were split?|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: some talking about the bidding between W and S|pg||
mb|6N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sharkey: 4@H OR as well|pg||
nt|mamos: well not many points here but the contract looks a good one|pg||
nt|rado: facing 5th fit and heraing 4@C values + fit @D lead is logical|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Pays your money, takes your choice, it says.|pg||
nt|andyv:  end result was disappointing (to the specs and us, that is)|pg||
nt|othered1: Wow, after the double, that @SJ promotes.  Wonder if west had alternatives to 6N?|pg||

pc|dK|pc|d9|pc|d7|nt|andyv:  now he leads a @h?|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|andyv:  game set and match|pg||
nt|lestergold: two bad bids Andy|pg||
mc|13|nt|othered1: But maybe north should have enouraged @C at trick 1, or if they play upside down signals south should have continued|pg||
nt|andyv:  J@c turned out to be a good lead... S had to follow thru|pg||
nt|othered1: did north discourage or did south ignore it?|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: N could have ducked @D to hand and then it would have been down 1|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: W went out|pg||

nt|lestergold: mind tyou what has west promised and east is close to min for his precision opener|pg||
nt|rado: if 2@C was artifital ( max pass or similar) S missed a chanse for lead directing DBL|pg||
nt|andyv:  ok, what am I missing here?|pg||
nt|andyv:  S has 2 points and his pd took 2 bids?|pg||

nt|mamos: and despite some favourable lies of the cards North still goes 2 off|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  N tried to fine tune the last hand too much|pg||

mb|1D!|nt|vugraphzym: I think E explain sth about the 1@D bid |pg||
nt|vugraphzym: but cant hear and I dont understand romanian :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  4@s the most likely one|pg||
nt|andyv:  auction should end at 2@s|pg||

mb|3N|nt|andyv:  :)|pg||

nt|star6ija: this is a typical example of "Partner, only me and not you know that 3N is more expensive than 2 or 1" from both sides of the table - invitation with 8 points and accepting with 15|pg||
nt|ybob: hand  with 50 hcp to E|pg||
nt|rado: some will open even 4@S at this vulnerability|pg||
nt|Walddk5: I am one of those|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: 3N best, as independent of @S suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: This NS pair like to get in at the 1-level.  Some, if playing weak jump overcalls, might have bid 2@D on morth's hand.|pg||
nt|lestergold: wahtr about ending at 2C|pg||
nt|lestergold: easty might venture in |pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: 1N seem useless and gave west the free cue-bid|pg||
nt|ybob: I think they play jump overcall 12/16|pg||

nt|rado: 5@D down due to @S ruff, 5@s ok|pg||

nt|andyv:  no appealing lead for S but still found the suit his pd wouldn't bid:)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|lestergold: 2d meaning Andy?|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|othered1: I like intermediate jumps, but not at this vulnerability.|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: he explained it is a "forcing bid. Nothing about @D"|pg||
nt|lestergold: checkback?|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mamos: this time I have more sympathy with NS|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: I actually like the 3NT by N :) he has terrific 15|pg||
pc|c3|nt|othered1: Thanks, I've seen hand 13, which went by before I arrived.|pg||
nt|ybob: :9|pg||
nt|ybob: :)|pg||
nt|othered1: 6@D or 6N is simply on finesse|pg||
nt|ybob: better 500 to NS|pg||
pc|c8|nt|sharkey: in my book 1 NT rebid wud show 18-19 and Dbl the actual hand|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|andyv:  if they play variable NT, this might have a different meaning for them|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - obviously|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3C looks makeable|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@d has to be some type of checkback, but 2@s looks like sign off|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c2|nt|othered1: So, slam and no slam are both reasonable|pg||
nt|andyv:  6@d not even on a finesse|pg||
nt|othered1: really?|pg||
nt|andyv:  and 6@s can't make|pg||
pc|cT|nt|andyv:  but otherwise I agree..1N shows about 18-19|pg||
nt|andyv:  this has a chance now|pg||
nt|sharkey: N willing to push to 4@H here - to much when pd didnt superaccept I think|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|othered1: how do you make 6@D without finesse?|pg||
nt|andyv:  you are right...need the @c hook to dump the @s|pg||
nt|andyv:  early morning disease...stupidity|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: cant you discard your @C on hearts|pg||
nt|andyv:  but still have a @h and @s loser if you do that|pg||
nt|othered1: yes, then lose @HA and @S|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: I see|pg||
nt|andyv:  and there we have it|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3N with qxx of dims somehat foolhardy|pg||
nt|rodal f: Squize at N now:)|pg||
pc|s8|nt|lestergold: defence can only cash first 7 triks|pg||
nt|andyv:  conceivable for EW to take the first 7 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: you can find results after 3rd round here -> http://bridge.bg/ranking163.html|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|lestergold: dimaond lead guaranteed|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: is the 4 the right @D to lead ? |pg||
nt|lestergold: even if for any reason declarer was allowed to win this trick its cold off|pg||
pc|s6|nt|lestergold: I think so|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: cant you block the suit ?|pg||
nt|andyv:  i think 4@d is ok here|pg||
nt|andyv:  but J@d better|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes you can but doesnt matter with east havinmg an entry and if east hasnt an entry the contract would make|pg||
nt|andyv:  suit will block up period|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: I would have led the J or even the K probably|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|othered1: This can put EW right back into the match, if OR pair takes the other side of the 50-50 shot.|pg||
nt|othered1: Or could lose a couple of imps if they play 6N|pg||
nt|andyv:  I'm trying to find the part of the auction which shows the @d fit has been found|pg||
pc|sA|nt|andyv:  ugh|pg||
nt|lestergold: stuill only 8 tricks for declarer|pg||
pc|s9|nt|othered1: 6@D, choice of slams?|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: I think 5@D might suggest @D game but not sure|pg||
nt|othered1: allowing a trick 1 claim|pg||
nt|andyv:  that sounds plausible|pg||
nt|rodal f: :(|pg||
pc|d3|nt|andyv:  ugh|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: and I dont like this 4@H bid by N because still S can have only 3@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: there is possible endplay now|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: no there isnt sry|pg||
pc|sT|pg||

pc|d5|pc|d7|nt|othered1: 5?|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|andyv:  backward squeeze:)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|othered1: Board 4 was a swing when NS played 2@H in OR, making and holding loss to 5 imps v. the EW 2@H here -300|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d9|nt|sharkey: but things happen...|pg||
nt|andyv:  E needs to learn patience on defense|pg||

pc|h4|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h2|pc|h6|nt|mamos: but here North hopes that West has all the values in @D and that the NS hands will fit   I think this is a bit unlucky|pg||

nt|lestergold: east has to play pard for K three dims to beat it|pg||
pc|cA|pc|d6|pc|c9|pc|c5|pg||

nt|lestergold: East playing pessimism bridge|pg||

nt|lestergold: frigidised|pg||
nt|andyv:  E is not playing bridge... just throwing cards now|pg||

nt|lestergold: then what was partner getting in with to lead his presumed QJ( of spades through with|pg||

nt|lestergold: Andy you are trying hard to be polite straining at the seams Id say|pg||
nt|andyv:  See Ed...board 5 was a swing board:))|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  empathy, Mike... we've all been there and done things at the table that later on we have no idea what we were thinking about.|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|vugraphzym: I think S's hand was pretty good and there was a finesse on and still down 1|pg||
nt|ybob: slam time|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D!|nt|andyv:  wonder if EW are playing non forcing free bids...that would explain double instead of 1@S bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: not clear who is buying this hand 3h N/S limit already reached|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: yes - some of it not suitable for the Family Hour :)|pg||
mb|1H|an|RF|nt|andyv:  12 imps picked up on Board 7 as strangely, they didn't get to that fine 4@h contract:0|pg||
nt|lestergold: c|pg||

mb|p|nt|lestergold: 3S a brave effort vul all on his own|pg||
mb|1S|an|relay|nt|lestergold: oh|pg||
nt|rado: but he decided to jump reverse immy|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: 2@C a variation of New Minor Forcing...?|pg||
nt|sharkey: 2@D I mean|pg||
nt|ybob: i prefer play 10 from dummy to invite another @D round|pg||
nt|andyv:  E came here to bid:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: prtner has promised a good hand with a good 6 card suit he happens to have neither|pg||
nt|andyv:  5@d very playable|pg||
nt|lestergold: but if west is going to bid it should be 4s|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5D needs a lot of good guessing|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2c a dim  heart and a spade to be lost on a bad day|pg||
nt|andyv:  only @d hook... but if N covers 10@S immediately, 5@d will go down|pg||
nt|ybob: yes|pg||
nt|othered1: after west supports @H, east will push the rest of the way|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: no way they can miss the slam now|pg||
nt|rado: facing strongest sequence available E has to check key  cards only for grand:)|pg||
nt|othered1: East's black honors are key in an auction like this.|pg||
nt|andyv:  always welcome Frank|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|andyv:  i play it as forcing|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: 5@D goes down with a @C switch aftrer K @H|pg||
nt|rado: rkcb for @H maybe|pg||
nt|othered1: Only question for east may be whether a black suit might be more solid than @H.|pg||
nt|ybob: 5@H = 2+Q @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|star6ija: this is a nice event... actually it started in the year of 2005 as Balkan Championship|pg||
nt|othered1: with west having a possible pitch on the @D.|pg||
nt|rado: AQJx Qxx x AKJxx might be W's hand:)|pg||
nt|ybob: i play 6Nt with E hand|pg||
nt|othered1: That's what I was considering|pg||
nt|rado: so after KC reply some pick a slam bid would be nice|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: W is holding his head|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: he seems not to understand 4@S bid|pg||
nt|othered1: if you have a pick a slam call available after setting trumps with RKC|pg||
nt|ybob: kickback ?|pg||
nt|rado: if E had 4-4 in Majors with FG he may bid 4@S directly, so now he has more|pg||
nt|ybob: i dont like a 4º suit in a Fg sequence|pg||
mb|2N|nt|vugraphzym: W alerted 3@C|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4d may have a more realistic chance of a plus score|pg||
nt|andyv:  if they find the switch...pd doesn't always have 5 for his 3 level raise|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: now he alerted and explained RBC|pg||
nt|rado: btw other room stoped at 4@H|pg||
nt|rado: so a swing expected|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: agree Andy - 2@H may have been non-forcing|pg||
nt|andyv:  looking for @c slam?|pg||
nt|othered1: I'll settle for a 1-imp loss of 5 when I stop short of the grand.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Thx Andy, the humorist by swings|pg||
mb|3H|nt|sharkey: has it chances... but will probably fail|pg||
nt|star6ija: Mr Toni Rousev from Stara Zagora, supported by some local enthusiasts helped the idea to come true|pg||
nt|sharkey: how many nations participate Momchil?|pg||
nt|andyv:  NS used their rabbit's foot on this auction|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  slam asperations died a quick death|pg||
nt|sharkey: this may be trouble too...|pg||
nt|star6ija: 2 years ago Balkan Championship started to change its locality... Bucarest year ago and Novi Sad (Serbia) - November this year|pg||
nt|lestergold: partner can show count|pg||
nt|othered1: In other room, I think east didin't give enough value to the black honors|pg||
nt|andyv:  tough to stay out of gameon this one but well done by EW|pg||
pc|c7|nt|othered1: A little lucky that 6@H is so playable,  6N didnt seem to be under consideration.  Guess ruffing out long @C suit was possible|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: and still looks like they are going down|pg||
pc|c4|nt|andyv:  if N is listening:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: or dont they have such sophisticated kit|pg||
nt|andyv:  ok, Mike, pay up:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: pay up?|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: they are playing only 4 :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: although if W didnt have J of @C a club switch would have been vital even in 4|pg||
nt|andyv:  still, they should try to defend it properly|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ybob: What if W hand was AQJX QXX Q AKJXX ?|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|star6ija: we have record concerning the number of the participants this year|pg||
nt|andyv:  probably want to take @c hook thru N|pg||
nt|ybob: or AQJX QJ X AKJXXX|pg||
nt|othered1: 23 highs and misfit isn't automatic to push to game.|pg||
nt|andyv:  need @d switch|pg||
nt|othered1: won't @C back also work?|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||
nt|andyv:  what do you do on j@s then?|pg||

nt|sharkey: @D10 shud enforce @S signal|pg||

pc|d9|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
nt|star6ija: 12 teams from Bulgaria, Romania, Serbia, Greece and Sweden take a part in the competition|pg||
nt|rodal f: No. 10 then on one original trumh trick at @S with a new pitch in @D|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|andyv:  mainly not to make it easy for @s shift|pg||
nt|sharkey: not at all|pg||
pc|h3|nt|andyv:  and W just managed to go down in 4|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh dear|pg||

nt|ahri: but i'd do it on a worse hand than this, without Q@d for example|pg||

nt|lestergold: at least it would have been an attemopt to make the contract|pg||
nt|othered1: That second hand with QJ tight in @H isn't possible -- 3@H would be criminal in my eyes|pg||
nt|ybob: bid you 4@C with this hand ?|pg||
nt|othered1: 4 boards to go in a very tight match|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|andyv:  N also had 2 pitches on the club... their system doesn't allow them to tell pd what suit to shift to?|pg||
nt|andyv:  S is betting N's major is not @s|pg||
nt|othered1: 3@H -p - p- dbl?|pg||
nt|othered1: multi may work OK here, avoiding 3-level dive, not that 2-level will be a pleasure, either.|pg||
mb|2H|nt|othered1: NS should get to a quick 4@H here.  EW competition won't be effective, as 4@S isn't a good save|pg||
nt|othered1: If south doesn't bid it, north will accept an invite|pg||
nt|andyv:  now, this is a grand that will be fun to get to|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: I play 2@H as takeout of @S, wonder if east does, too.|pg||
mb|3C|nt|star6ija: hello everybody :)|pg||
nt|othered1: If so, a high @D contract is possible|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: personally, I don't think the second hand is worth a jump shift|pg||
mb|3D|nt|othered1: 3N?  Sound preemptive raise?|pg||
nt|andyv:  I guess so|pg||
nt|andyv:  now 4@h?|pg||
nt|othered1: but what, then is 3@C?|pg||
nt|andyv:  a suit|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|andyv:  wow, the 1N opener going further down the scale|pg||
nt|andyv:  to the illegal zone in the ACBL|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: looks like 9-11 in green vs red|pg||
nt|sharkey: I think pitching @D from the top shud have conveyed the message Andy|pg||
nt|sharkey: N passed...|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: they missed the slam in the other room as well btw |pg||
nt|othered1: Hi!|pg||
nt|lestergold: declarer needs to duck this club |pg||
mb|p|nt|star6ija: this is popular convention in Serbia... shows limited raise to 4@hs (4+ trumps) and Ace outside|pg||
nt|andyv:  won't happen|pg||
nt|lestergold: I didnt think he would|pg||
nt|othered1: and forcing?  2@H must not have been just for takout.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|lestergold: Hi everyone held up at the dentists sorry|pg||
nt|ybob: Hi|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: ty.  specifying side Ace could be very useful|pg||
mb|4D|nt|andyv:  I agree Carl...I'm just amazed that with all the pitches they couldn't come up with the right answer.|pg||
nt|sharkey: must be different range 3rd hand opening 1 NT?|pg||
nt|ybob: now ? 3@S or 4@C ?|pg||
nt|andyv:  W won't let this stop here|pg||
nt|othered1: West wisely continues|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: real @H support, providing an easy, natural rebid makes the difference to me|pg||
nt|othered1: how does west possibly get across such good support, 4-cards long?|pg||
nt|othered1: RKC could come up short the @DQ.|pg||
nt|andyv:  I thought 4@h bid was an obvious choice for that|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ybob: ??|pg||
nt|othered1: do we know why 2@C was alerted?|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: it shows at least 9 minor cards|pg||
nt|ybob: m´s i think 9 + cards|pg||
nt|othered1: ty|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: it can be 5@C and 4@D|pg||
nt|ybob: playing strong @C i prefer rebids 3@C shows 5 / 5 m´s max|pg||
nt|othered1: I'll be surprised if south bids again, on the misfit without knowing of extra @C length.|pg||
nt|ybob: hard to S|pg||
nt|ybob: HX  X  5/6@D  4@C ...|pg||
mb|p|nt|ybob: 3@D shows 5+ @D 4@C ...|pg||
mb|4S|nt|othered1: I'm more comfortable making an immediate strong bid on the south hand, like 2@H, if available.  Prevents decisions like this one, since partner would know of possible slam interest ...|pg||
nt|othered1: right away.|pg||
nt|lestergold: and now an avalanche of tricks for the defence|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: Hi Robert and Ed|pg||
mb|4N|nt|andyv:  in the ACBL, any NT that has a range of less than 10 cannot use any conventions with it (xfers, stayman, etc)|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|nt|vugraphzym: J of spade confused the declarer|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: he must be wondering who is lying|pg||
nt|andyv:  EW seem to be getting bogged down again|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: a brave pass of the second round takeout double denying much high card strenth|pg||
mb|7D|nt|lestergold: ducking wouldnt have helped tho|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  I guess they knew what they were doing:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  nicely done|pg||
nt|ritong: impressive|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: S asking about the bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: can set up a @C but there's no useful pitch|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: but as cards lie 3S has no play|pg||

nt|othered1: Another just about exactly 50 percent game.  NV staying out isn't hopeless, but nowadays pairs bid games.|pg||
nt|othered1: yes, very well done.  Wonder what all that bidding meant, however, especially 3@C|pg||
mb|1N|nt|othered1: If north weren't a passed hand, south might have tried a responsive double, pretty aggressively|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@s EW|pg||
mb|3H|nt|othered1: south may have choices here, including a gambling 3N.|pg||
mb|3S|nt|othered1: looks like a professional 1N.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well an interesting 20/20 hand here|pg||
nt|andyv:  it has everything you want in a NT bid, Ed:)|pg||
mb|4C|nt|star6ija: normally, restrictaions in regular clubs should be made in accordance with the most recent Contract Bridge Laws|pg||
nt|othered1: if you play (really) weak jump shift responses, north might h ave qualified.|pg||
nt|rado: seems E believes in reopening|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: No  high level contracts making here for anyone|pg||
nt|othered1: Do you double with east's hand?  Or bid 1N?  or pass?|pg||
nt|ybob: i prefer 1NT over X|pg||
nt|ybob: X with 4333  dont like|pg||
nt|rado: if K@S was in other suits could dbl|pg||
nt|lestergold: 1N whats the problem a balace 11|pg||
nt|othered1: My choices would be pass, 1N and dbl in that order|pg||
nt|othered1: We rarely trap at these colors|pg||
nt|lestergold: pass is allowed at unfavourable but normal balance range is 11-14|pg||
nt|othered1: 3N can go for 500|pg||
mb|4S|nt|othered1: only 4?|pg||
nt|star6ija: it would be interesting how Ivanova will deal with 4@h here|pg||
nt|andyv:  Hi Momchil!|pg||
nt|othered1: Do you play pass of the redouble as penalty?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzym: yes he bid 4@D|pg||
nt|ybob: p p p ?|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2H fo N/S maybe 2/3 dims or E/W|pg||
mb|p|nt|rado: 2@H has a play|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: W alerted 2@D|pg||
nt|ybob: becuase E is passed hand i prefer 1NT , pass , never X|pg||
nt|rado: maybe transfer?|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2D presumably an intended transfer to hearts|pg||
nt|othered1: 2@D looks like a misentry|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: yes but E didnt understand it?|pg||
nt|lestergold: or as u say a misentry|pg||
nt|lestergold: something is seriously remiss at any rate|pg||
nt|rado: but N is happy|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: mind you with the 5/0 heart break 2h may well be unmaneagable|pg||
nt|lestergold: if passed it will be a misery|pg||
nt|rado: and surely will find the lead|pg||
pc|h5|nt|sharkey: im thinking ACBL which different in many respect than European standards|pg||
nt|andyv:  lots of club games in the states make up their own rules... mostly to keep the paying customers happy|pg||
nt|star6ija: hello, Andy :)|pg||
nt|othered1: south to the rescue|pg||
nt|lestergold: South is still there wantinmg to say i really do have a mountain pard|pg||
nt|othered1: But there was no reason for south to know the wheels were coming off EW|pg||
nt|lestergold: giving west a chance to er em show his er second suit!!|pg||
pc|h6|nt|andyv:  the bigger ones adhere to the ACBL standards|pg||
nt|othered1: Bidding 2@H is normal, despite suit disparities, planning to rebid @S, showing extras for sure|pg||
pc|hT|nt|star6ija: @d lead ould be helpful for declarer|pg||
nt|lestergold: if east wakes up he may not give preference by bidding 3D|pg||
nt|othered1: I think the redouble opposite a passed partner showed the strength adequately, but the double did imply the shape|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|ybob: cant win 4@D or 4@H|pg||
nt|andyv:  ask and you will receive:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: north wants out of this auction badly|pg||
nt|ybob: 2@H  -1 surely|pg||
nt|lestergold: looks like one offski|pg||
nt|othered1: or 2|pg||
nt|lestergold: surely a spade lead then 3 losers in each major unavoidable|pg||
nt|othered1: this won't be trivial to play|pg||
pc|c2|nt|star6ija: this is fine policy|pg||
nt|sharkey: i have to leave now - ty all - enjoyed|pg||
nt|sharkey: bye|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty Carl...see you soon|pg||
nt|othered1: In OR, east knew to stay out, after south opened 1@C (presumably big)|pg||
nt|lestergold: declarer lucky with the minors no losers unless there is an 'accident' in dims|pg||
nt|lestergold: like ducking when north switches to a diamondafter ruffing the third spade needs presence of mind here|pg||
pc|cA|nt|othered1: I think north was timid, if south's 2@C openings aren't a joke.|pg||
nt|othered1: quite helpful -- splits here make this far from easy but that lead softens things up for declarer|pg||
nt|andyv:  now can play it off the top|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|lestergold: defence should probably make 3 spades a club and 2 heart tricks|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|othered1: @Dshift now beats, n o?|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h7|nt|star6ija: Leroumain's team is going to finish the match a little bit agressively|pg||
nt|andyv:  putting pressure on declarer|pg||
nt|othered1: declarer has to be careful, but 10 tricks look easy, even with @C tap here|pg||
pc|hA|pc|s7|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|star6ija: they made compensation to 3@ss contract which is cold on the actual laydown|pg||
nt|andyv:  should make 3@h tricks |pg||
nt|othered1: was south's play of @H10 as opposed to 9 meaningful? |pg||
pc|sA|nt|lestergold: maybe 2 off with dim ruff reentry with club and another diamonjd effectively promoting anothet trump|pg||
nt|othered1: should north ruff here?|pg||
nt|lestergold: now ruff the winner|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pg||
nt|ybob: -1 now|pg||
nt|lestergold: no imagination !!|pg||
nt|lestergold: absolutely but not many would see the no cost play of ruffing and playing a diamond|pg||
nt|andyv:  apparently not to N|pg||
pc|d3|nt|othered1: let me retract easy.  East on several lines|pg||
nt|lestergold: that would deserve a prize at this level|pg||
nt|andyv:  but, why didn't S play the A@h instead of the 10@h?|pg||
nt|andyv:  when W ruffs, that should get the message across pretty loudly|pg||

nt|ybob: best defense was 2 round @C from S|pg||
nt|othered1: of course, going plus was the primary NS objective|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@h by N?|pg||
nt|ybob: S cant have 14 cards so play first A @D if K not drop K@C was stiff|pg||
nt|lestergold: well an unlucky game here in hearts for N/S with the black suit Ks both worth the square root of ZIP|pg||
mb|p|nt|star6ija: 2N-3@d|pg||
nt|star6ija: 4@s :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  if you were investigating for slam... but are you with this hand?|pg||
nt|andyv:  despite all the inexactitudes, we have a very tight match|pg||
mb|4S|nt|andyv:  think EW will bid that high?|pg||
nt|othered1: I agree on best defense|pg||
nt|andyv:  it's close|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  support dbl|pg||
nt|ybob: easy 4@S here|pg||
nt|othered1: I'd be afraid to act as east.|pg||
nt|lestergold: I cant cope with that many syllables this time o the morning Andy|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: This is a no-brainer to 650|pg||
nt|andyv:  E has had the afraid gene taken out of him|pg||
nt|othered1: now 4@D?|pg||
nt|andyv:  outstanding score by EW in the OR|pg||
nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: however equally well E/W cards play quite well in dpades perhaps not quite enuf for game tho|pg||
nt|othered1: Things are looking good for Beograd, but there's still that grand to bid on board 9|pg||
pc|hK|nt|othered1: My partners might think I had something and overcompete|pg||
nt|lestergold: an outstandingly bad double in the open room|pg||
pc|h2|nt|othered1: so far looks like Precision.  Is that what they play?|pg||
nt|ybob: yep|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: yes they play precision|pg||
pc|h4|nt|andyv:  yeap... making this auctiom more complicated than needed to be;)|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|andyv:  would you pull dbl with E hand?|pg||
pc|d4|nt|othered1: 3@D did stop slam and west might have had a normal looking @C lead, so I guess it was worth the risk|pg||
pc|dT|nt|andyv:  i think it's clear to pull|pg||
nt|star6ija: if 2@s is GF... pass is correct option|pg||
nt|andyv:  pd passed 1@D and you have maybe one defensive trick|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't think 2@s can be GF...probably a limit raise with 4|pg||
nt|mamos: North South are having a nightmare set|pg||
pc|d2|nt|othered1: so 2N showed @Sxxxxx|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: 2NT is 5332 I suppose|pg||
nt|star6ija: no... 2N is waiting|pg||
nt|ybob: 2@S dont ask trump suit|pg||
nt|star6ija: no it doesn't|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: this might be the desisive deal|pg||
nt|lestergold: well i do not claim to understand this auction which is totally absurd but will make a profit in tis case|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ogoksel: They play 1NT 6-12|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|nt|star6ija: as far as the hand is passed it just tries to define better game|pg||
nt|lestergold: this straight off on top|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|andyv:  @d switch now|pg||
nt|lestergold: North must think they are playin 1N forcing and south doesnt|pg||
nt|ybob: 7 imps|pg||
mc|11|nt|mamos: even when they gained imps by 6NT the TD took it away in the other room|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: EW are playing very good |pg||
nt|andyv:  in OR, S opened 3@c and got the auction to the 5 level where he decided to dbl.|pg||
nt|andyv:  and finally, last board|pg||

nt|andyv:  ty Deyan for an outstanding job|pg||
nt|star6ija: and again possible swing|pg||
nt|star6ija: bravo, Dido :) nice job|pg||
nt|star6ija: and thanks to Andy and to all kibitzers for joining us|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: This is the last deal of this round. Tx all for watching and special thanks to the commentators. We'll be back in 14CET.Thats in 2 hours 20 min.|pg||
nt|andyv:  and ty Momchil (and Carl too).|pg||
nt|andyv:  coming up to our final board of this set|pg||
nt|andyv:  and our final board of this match.|pg||
nt|lestergold: and a tricky 4S which can and indeed was defeated in theopen|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty Mike, Deyan and all the specs who have joined us.|pg||
nt|lestergold: it can also be let thru|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: Last board of the round. Tx Mike and Andy. We'll be back at 13CET with the last round of the round robin.|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: This is the last board of the event. Thank you all comentator and kibtzs.|pg||
nt|andyv:  many thanks to our operator, Deyan, for an excellent job.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: some of my club members play this form of bidding style it usually means why consult partner when i can guess a bid all by myself|pg||
nt|andyv:  Ed, it's been a pleasure as always.|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ybob: 3NT = cold from E|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: This looks like a wash, so Ankara's lead will stand up.|pg||
nt|othered1: North really likes to have his bids.|pg||
nt|andyv:  And thank you to all the specs who make these events so enjoyable for all of us.|pg||
nt|othered1: Thanks, Andy, it's mutual.  And thanks, Deyan, for the fine presentation.|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|ybob: from W @D leads can defeat|pg||
mb|2S|nt|othered1: 6@D is really excellent|pg||
nt|andyv:  thank you Deyan for an excellent job.|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: wrong again.|pg||
nt|lestergold: what on earth are they playing at?|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: well then this is the decisive one|pg||
nt|Walddk5: 2@S should show a sound opener with six good spades in the balancing seat|pg||
nt|othered1: What did 2@S imply?  Looks intermediate to me, but north didin't see it that way.|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: it seems Beograd will make it to the final|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Just what South has, so North should bid again|pg||
nt|othered1: You wouldn't open AKQJxx, xx, xxx, xx?|pg||
nt|lestergold: i was thinking how close this was to a Roland slam|pg||
nt|ogoksel: 2@S shows 11-15 but N is not sure about that i guess|pg||
nt|ybob: 2@S in 4º shows 11/13 6º to me|pg||
nt|andyv:  with the bad break in @hs it looks as if NS did well to make 4@h in OR|pg||
mb|3H|nt|star6ija: hope to see you in 2 hours for next round of this very interesting competition |pg||
nt|othered1: OR found grand slam also, so this match is constructively over.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: in any thx excellent operator and very much enjoyed our double act Andy look forward to working with u again sometime|pg||
nt|lestergold: I'm gong back to bed for a nice kip|pg||
nt|andyv:  same here Mike...it was fun and some pretty zany boards kept us awake:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: indeed|pg||
nt|andyv:  their sequence a little easier to understand:)|pg||
mb|4C|nt|andyv:  as a spec pointed out, 4H may be optimum contract|pg||
nt|othered1: but there's no reason for EW to know best positioning|pg||
nt|ybob: hard to humans not win 1º trick with K @D|pg||
nt|othered1: 3@D (4th suit still forcing?)|pg||
nt|star6ija: very nice comeback to Rossenovo team, who was 18 IMPs behind in first 2 boards|pg||
nt|star6ija: this 1@d bid could be very expensive|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: This is the last board for today. Thank you all. Tomorrow we start at 9CET.|pg||
nt|lestergold: playing tis system with a chicken uinderbidder is kamikazi|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: 12-15 in my book|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4N|nt|vugraphzym: looks very easy to make|pg||
nt|star6ija: this will probably end plus one and 11 IMPs Cernato are just to come|pg||
nt|star6ija: and it was|pg||
nt|andyv:  thank you Ed and Momchil and all the specs who make these events fun and entertaining.|pg||
nt|othered1: wow, that was ineffective|pg||
nt|lestergold: youth bridge usually has some fun for specs and commenttaors but thre has been somje good signs of talent here|pg||
nt|andyv:  this should make|pg||
mb|p|nt|star6ija: now even to overtricks are possible|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: 602 126 889|pg||
nt|othered1: I wonder what would have happened on the grand slam if north at one table or the other had decided to preempt to the 3 level on the 7-bagger at those colors.  Could it have played ...|pg||
nt|othered1: their, doubled and down much less than the grand?|pg||
nt|othered1: played there|pg||
nt|andyv:  we won't know it feels to me that E would have simply bid 3N then|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: 5@C may survive for a nice pick-up, but can they get there?|pg||
nt|othered1: with only the @HQ possibly duplicated, east has so many tricks it feels timid not to make another move.  Of course, I don't know what west has shown exactly|pg||
nt|lestergold: isnt this leada bit damaging|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Looks like NS may give a bunch back here, but it  won't be enough.  EW here did have their chances with sounder play.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|othered1: Need good partnership to handle shortness cue-bids in partner's known long suits.|pg||
nt|ybob: disagree with 4@S|pg||
nt|othered1: that's another way to put it :)|pg||
nt|othered1: No, NS stopped quickly enough to survive this, I think.|pg||
nt|andyv:  not sure why S didn't simply xfer and then bid @ds to show the 2 suits|pg||
nt|andyv:  with this lead, yes|pg||
nt|othered1: maybe they don't play transfers?|pg||
pc|h8|nt|othered1: That should end it firmly.|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h5|pg||
nt|andyv:  could be but I thought they did earlier... maybe an illusion|pg||
nt|andyv:  they do... look at board 1:)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|star6ija: two|pg||
nt|andyv:  guess @hs right and as one spec points out, without @s lead, can make 6|pg||
nt|andyv:  at least the play won't take long|pg||
nt|lestergold: only 8 tricks on top here|pg||
pc|c2|nt|lestergold: hi Roland been taking ur name in vain again|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|pg||
nt|othered1: West doesn't see it my way, but without detailed system and style notes, it's hard to be sure where the rot set in|pg||
nt|ybob: i prefer bid 3@S over 3@C ...|pg||
nt|othered1: I agree with 3@S.  You bid 4th suit to set up forcing bid in @S, so why not bid hand out?|pg||
nt|ybob: where are extra cards from W ?|pg||
nt|othered1: 4@C bid, in casual partnerships, might have been seen as having strong preference and good support for @C that justified 4th suit auction.|pg||
nt|othered1: I personally think west had to respect the 5@C sign-off (if that'swhat it was.)  But he may be taking a shot against an expected @CAxxx in the east hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: This is the last board. Tx for all specs and kibtzs. We'll be back in 10 min for the last round of today|pg||
nt|andyv:  they may actually pick up an imp here|pg||
nt|andyv:  very little EW can do to stop them |pg||
pc|d8|nt|othered1: West may think they aren't in a good position in this match.|pg||
nt|ybob: AXXX needs trump 2/2 in unbal hand sure, lost A @D ...|pg||
pc|d5|nt|othered1: Unusual for me to have less for my bid than most, but I think 10-13 (or bad slightly better) works well.|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cK|nt|star6ija: once again :) big thanks everybody for joining us - see you in 2 PM CET (2 hours since now)|pg||
nt|othered1: Onthe other hand, a round robin is very much like a single match of great length, so shooting to win this match may not be best overall strategy|pg||
nt|andyv:  probably 5-7 hand with @d support and stiff @h|pg||
nt|ybob: i open 1@S and rebid 2@S with 14/15|pg||
pc|cA|pc|h4|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|andyv:  W might have been worried about a 4-1 @h break|pg||
nt|andyv:  or was trying to get his name in the papers by smothering the 10x of @hs;)|pg||
nt|star6ija: 13th trick will save 1 IMP eventually|pg||
nt|star6ija: yup|pg||
pc|h9|nt|andyv:  looks like a push board |pg||
nt|lestergold: no play that i can see Andy|pg||
pc|c4|pc|hK|pg||
pc|d2|nt|star6ija: yes and this was the proper way to avoid the danger if 4 were with S|pg||
pc|d3|nt|andyv:  good night all from Los Angeles|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: thanks all see you in 2 hours 10 min . |pg||
nt|vugraphzym: good night andy :)|pg||
nt|star6ija: iF n DUCKED WITH 4TH kING... jACK IS THE LOSING OPTIN|pg||
nt|star6ija: this is the last board from Round Robin :) stay with us for upcomming semifinals and final|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: This was the last deal of the round robin. We start 1/2 finals at 15CET|pg||
nt|mamos: the rout is complete :(   sorry for NS this has been a disatrous set|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: are You hungry?|pg||
nt|vugraphzym: We'll be back at 15CET with the 1/2 finalist|pg||
