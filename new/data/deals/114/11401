nt|daman: related*|pg||
nt|brolucius: A big hand to welcome us all to the event.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We will probably see Angelini's version of Precision at this table|pg||
nt|lml: hello Sabine|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think both pairs play 2/1|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: Good Morning =) Buon giorno|pg||
nt|sharkey: so almost half way and a close match it is|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Victor is probably disappointed that we won't see Acol in action|pg||
nt|hedyg: depends if you want to watch something different lol|pg||
nt|daman: Alfredo is nice to watch :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: Buon pomeriggio a tutti! Good evening to everybody! =)|pg||
nt|brolucius: And the tight scoreline is a bonus.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: N-S play Precision a la Angelini|pg||
nt|ritong: ciao roberta|pg||
nt|andyv:  Good morning, Roberta:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: NS CC: http://www.ecatsbridge.org/documents/files/ConventionCards/2008Pau-european/OpenTeams/Italy/angelini-sementa.pdf|pg||
nt|hedyg: i have no idea what system EW play, but we will see|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Angelini will likely open 1NT passed to West|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yesterday we had several deals where the points were divided 20-20 (not usually a good sign for entertaining viewing). I see here that the Great Dealer has made it 21-19 for a ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: change. Ah, yes.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: who will double, presumably|pg||
nt|andyv:  strong finish in the last 4 boards in the previous round surged Padova ahead|pg||
nt|mariner1: Hi all|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you can have my share of the danish wine when it comes, rob|pg||
nt|bridge_one: of course Gazzilli (1Maj 1NT, 2@C=gazzilli to introduce natural hand or many strong hands)|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S NS seems easy enough here|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes 18/19 (20)|pg||
nt|cicus: there was a hand yesterday when the bidding was at 5@D with Fantoni thinking|pg||
nt|cicus: I went to have dinner and when I returned he was still in thoughts|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Team Villa Fabbriche from beautiful Tuscany, Angelini from (also beautiful) Rome|pg||
nt|daman: and we're off.....|pg||
nt|daman: Hi Avram|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2008MindSportGamesBeijing/Open/Italy/fantoni-nunes.pdf|pg||
nt|ralfwil: The same players an the session before?|pg||
nt|mariner1: EW in @S partial here|pg||
nt|brolucius: If you needed to pick up 90 IMPs in 16 boards, you would not wish to see the opponents' seats occupied by Nunes/Fantoni.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|daman: want a big hand?   clap clap clap|pg||
nt|mariner1: very close match after this many boards|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: =) ty|pg||
nt|haans: Padova Bridge are not a team to run over|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and they're off|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1@D = 4 cards|pg||
nt|jcmax: Will w show his 2-suiter over a 1@S opening?|pg||
nt|april7: Hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 10-15  5+ diamonds, unbalanced|pg||
nt|ralfwil: as...|pg||
nt|cicus: this does not look like a deal of fireworks|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: So 1@C  16+|pg||
nt|daman: uh oh|pg||
nt|hedyg: 12 -15 NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good morning Liz and David|pg||
nt|bridge_one: both team are playing in the best formation|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The gap even bigger in the women's final. Catania up by 98 IMPs|pg||
mb|3H|nt|jcmax: How many rounds have been played so far?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@D  0-7|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: BUONA SERA A TUTTI!!!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Semi-finals now, knockout|pg||
nt|hedyg: NS CC http://www.ecatsbridge.org/documents/files/ConventionCards/2008Pau-european/OpenTeams/Italy/angelini-sementa.pdf|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A surprise|pg||
nt|andyv:  xfer to @hs apperently|pg||
nt|bridge_one: gazzilli convention was invented by ... mister Gazzilli :)|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Good morning, Roland and everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 10-13  sorry|pg||
nt|bridge_one: also 9|pg||
nt|sybarra: it is unbalanced |pg||
nt|bridge_one: Pulgo is a slow player|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Pulga|pg||
nt|roswolf: nortth should raise@S|pg||
nt|bridge_one: technically very strong|pg||
nt|daman: East will bid his @Cs no matter what|pg||
nt|sybarra: I bid on with 652... |pg||
nt|hedyg: no slam here|pg||
nt|andyv:  a possible 6@h hand that won't make|pg||
nt|brolucius: No, some say that the Great Dealer does not approve of bridge being played on a Sunday and therefore provides a moderate collection of deals.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 4@H seems simple enough here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: or his two half-suits?|pg||
nt|april7: 4@S down from the top and 4@C makable by EW|pg||
nt|sybarra: (maybe be wrong) but shape is tooooooooooo  good |pg||
mb|3S|nt|hedyg: looks like a transfer|pg||
nt|andyv:  Angelini replaced by Lauria|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No point in my opinion since it's not your hand. Then all you achieve is to give the show away|pg||
nt|cicus: now a somewhat unlucky 4@H to begin with|pg||
nt|cicus: gm Liz and David|pg||
nt|april7: what does 21d opening sow?|pg||
nt|daman: most of us would open the East hand at the one level notwithstanding|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@S for NS, 4@C for E/W|pg||
nt|roswolf: I think everyone would but over 5@S at some point!?|pg||
nt|roswolf: was rdbl conventional?|pg||
nt|cicus: a spade partial to be expected, I guess 2@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: looks like 3 NT has some good prospects here EW|pg||
nt|cuttysark: no contract is comfotrable when they hold all the aces|pg||
nt|daman: I don't think the auction will reach 5@S|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ralfwil: 32 hp on EW - let us see what happens|pg||
nt|daman: doesn't seem to be a slam in sight|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nunes doubled a 12-14 NT in the other room|pg||
nt|andyv:  W looking at the security of the @h suit instead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: North escaped to 2@C and is playing there|pg||
nt|bridge_one: a strong player in 60/70|pg||
nt|bridge_one: from Milan|pg||
nt|april7: what's 2@D opening?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i think Rinaldi will bid 4@h now , instead 4@S|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@D 5+@D 9/12|pg||
nt|april7: tu|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think I might have bid 4 @H on the way |pg||
nt|roswolf: if it just shows a max pass + spade support then north should bid on now|pg||
nt|daman: North's hand is significantly devalued on the auction|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 10-13 (good 9) it reads on their CC|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: 2@H will result in a minus for EW|pg||
nt|jtr: Good morning people|pg||
nt|andyv:  specs already active...a slightly worse 6NT that might make|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@c relay?|pg||
nt|brolucius: West can more or less tell that a slam cannot be better than a finesse, facing a passed hand.|pg||
nt|hedyg: 15-17 NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's not so much a question of Sunday, more like what *time* on a Sunday|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: that makes|pg||
nt|andyv:  misfit may slow them down|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Only 11 tricks on this layout. No squeeze|pg||
nt|brolucius: Five hearts, a diamond and a spade - one down.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If they switch to spades in time|pg||
nt|daman: I'm sure they will|pg||
nt|Walddk2: TRue, but hearts could have been 2-2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It is not fair to start in the middle of the night|pg||
nt|brolucius: North decides that there is not much point in raising to 2@S immediately, since South bid only 1@S in response to the negative double. South would have bid 2@S if he had anything ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: approaching what is needed for game.|pg||
nt|cicus: i'm up since 7 in the morning|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  3 or 4N likely spot|pg||
nt|daman: do we know what system EW are playing/|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but a throw in for 12 - or?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: undo please|pg||
nt|odysseus69: whenever I commentate I notice that every man opens balanced 11 - I wonder if the disease has spread to wwmens bridge|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It has, mostly because N-S can't attack spades. The suit is frozen for the defence|pg||
nt|andyv:  should be -1 but @h leads may create more problems for declarer|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4@H could be better to give at the pattner more information about to decide after a 5@c by West|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1NT by E would deny 4 @hs|pg||
pc|cT|nt|hedyg: 2NT=22-24|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N or 4@S plays ok,,,,,,,|pg||
nt|mariner1: dbl of course takeout|pg||
nt|andyv:  a Roland slam missed|pg||
nt|roswolf: maybe but for a sac it is good since opps hands have improved|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes, Roland 13 is the limit of 2open by E/W|pg||
nt|mariner1: same spot in Open Room|pg||
nt|jcmax: good view by Lauria. Game might have play opposite a perfect hand. But perfect hands are so rare. He has played so long, he knows that very well :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I don´t like the pass on 1@s from N|pg||
pc|c4|nt|andyv:  I like 3N by S|pg||
nt|odysseus69: nice easy game to start|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - the 9s and 10s coming into play here|pg||
nt|hedyg: Angelini will want to show AK@C?|pg||
nt|daman: a plus for NS    but, probably a push|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@d showed @hs thus the 3@H bid|pg||
pc|c7|nt|lml: 3NT is a fine contract |pg||
nt|jcmax: hmmm good double fit , I am not so sure it is not EW's hand|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@S is 6 cards|pg||
nt|marlowepi: agree totally roland but we all know that many top players don;t worry so much about that|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Indeed - I predict a flat board|pg||
nt|cicus: I expect a push, though|pg||
nt|andyv:  3N asks |pg||
nt|brolucius: No, with the singleton diamond, game could have been there. |pg||
nt|cicus: surprise, surely S was expected to bid 2@S?|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|lestergold: well we dont need 6 of us to analyse the play on this hand|pg||
nt|daman: you can reheat your coffees     this contract is in no danger|pg||
nt|brolucius: West had a bit to spare for his sequence, but the singleton spade entitled him to take a gloomy view of his hand.|pg||
nt|hedyg: especially on a @D lead?|pg||
nt|mariner1: D lead is right into the jaws|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, but could Angelini know that?|pg||
nt|jcmax: Here is an example wher the @DJ in either hand would just make a huge difference.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: good afternoon Rob, Bob, Andy and Hans|pg||
nt|mariner1: sure looks like 2 losers to em|pg||
nt|mariner1: me|pg||
nt|bobh1: hi ralf|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: hi Ralf|pg||
nt|andyv:  good morning Ralf:)|pg||
nt|haans: hejsan Ralf|pg||
nt|jcmax: But since NS are bidding all the way to 4@S it doesn't matter anyway :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: pd never has the perfect hand|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|daman: low from xx   2/4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You can actually make 12 tricks on any lead, but you need to guess well|pg||
nt|lestergold: north kinder mullered in the majors and end played|pg||
nt|hedyg: voila|pg||
pc|h9|nt|jcmax: There would be 12 tricks on normal breaks.|pg||
nt|lml: he has so many top tricks it doesnt much matter about the diamond lead|pg||
nt|daman: better switch to @Ss|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, but he can't afford to cash the other top honour|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes but more difficult|pg||
nt|daman: he can see the dummy|pg||
nt|hedyg: if he cashes another @c they lose the 1 @s trick|pg||
nt|brolucius: ...any particular question?|pg||
nt|andyv:  cue|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@d cue|pg||
pc|h3|nt|hedyg: no Roland, he could not and should be happy to play 4@s IMO|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the popularity of two-suited bids, and the tendency to use them whenever possible regardless of which side stands to benefit more, is well-established|pg||
nt|jtr: Do you also predict tonight's lottery numbers Liz?|pg||
nt|peachy: bidding might not be the same, what do you think?|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes a squeeze and endplay for 12 now|pg||
nt|daman: a @S is normal|pg||
nt|hedyg: wow wd|pg||
nt|andyv:  W sequence did show some slam interest|pg||
nt|hedyg: 5@D= 1 keycard (odd nr), here ace @D|pg||
pc|dA|nt|jcmax: But it is always extremely difficult to evaluate in the bidding. Especially when the suit never gets mentioned.|pg||
nt|jcmax: if the defence switches to diamonds in time that is|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A priori. 3-1: 50%  2-2: 40%  4-0: 10%   so you have not really been unlucky|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I shall predict if you like David, but I am usually wrong|pg||
nt|xenya: EW stopped in game in OR -- a chance for the trailing team?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He doesn't even know if they have a fit. Pass seemsøå¨'ø'|pg||
nt|Walddk2: ¨|pg||
pc|d8|nt|Walddk2: Versace could have had  Qxxxx  xx  xxx  KQx  and then 3NT isn't exactly a great spot|pg||
nt|odysseus69: North wondering whether declarer is trying to steal 1 club trick- clearly they dont lead 4th highest|pg||
nt|daman: South should be commended for not leading the @H King|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4NT would be even nr, any bid above is an odd nr|pg||
nt|andyv:  W doesn't know about @sK|pg||
nt|hedyg: Fantoni looking at his K@s.......|pg||
pc|d2|nt|brolucius: Is that Angelini or Versace sitting North?! Nice switch.|pg||
nt|cicus: even after a 1H opening the final contract is likely to be 4@H|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Yes, I did not predict the 4@H opening|pg||
nt|jtr: Well, that would exclude some combinations anyway|pg||
nt|andyv:  ignorance helped this time:)|pg||
nt|brolucius: If 4@S asked for controls, it does not seem that East has any reason to overrule partner.|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3NT denied a @s control, so 4@s is not cuebid, juust relay|pg||
nt|hedyg: just*|pg||
nt|brolucius: If 3NT denied a spade control, then East's lack of a sign-off has already shown a spade control in his own hand.|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|brolucius: 6@C was not too bad a contract. You can take both major-suit finesses (counting 11 tricks if one wins) and perhaps ruff a heart to bring the total to twelve.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: The lead indicates that he has something in majors|pg||
nt|daman: the @D 3 is a Slavinsky lead I am told|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 11 if declarer can sneak a spade|pg||
nt|bobh1: slam much worse than a hook since there are usually 2 @s losers|pg||
nt|daman: as some would|pg||
nt|hedyg: it should yes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: pretty clear|pg||
nt|Walddk2: d.... cat!|pg||
nt|cicus: all is well but questionable actions by NS on the 4th round of bidding|pg||
pc|dK|nt|hedyg: with xx he would sign off|pg||
nt|xenya: good point, if we read the auction correctly|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|hedyg: yes wd|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes, that's why it's a Roland slam|pg||
pc|d5|nt|jcmax: in this kind of situation knowing the count is very important|pg||
nt|bobh1: 4@s decent spot|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Angelini-Versace N-S in the open room. Fantoni-Nunes sitting out|pg||
nt|bobh1: at imps anyway|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, 2@C was strange.|pg||
nt|poohbear: :)|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|brolucius: With a loser in each major suit, declarer needs to take the club finesse. Yes, he has.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Very good lead. Fantoni has no choice, though|pg||
nt|haans: well done buy S|pg||
pc|s4|nt|sharkey: yes - S will duck|pg||
nt|jcmax: it is important for e now to know the W had an original 5-card suit|pg||
nt|sybarra: would be easy to do |pg||
nt|daman: I am told in the OR    NS are in 5@H doubled|pg||
nt|roswolf: that wont make|pg||
nt|daman: so a big pickup for Fabrbriche|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sK|nt|hedyg: wow now|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 11|pg||
nt|mariner1: Andy Roland slams make :)|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|mariner1: well the @HA play works :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  so he tell me:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  tells|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mariner1: they just defy the odds :)|pg||
pc|h7|nt|Walddk2: He seems to know|pg||
pc|hT|nt|hedyg: now they get all their tricks|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|hedyg: @C finesse and @s|pg||
pc|c9|nt|haans: now small spade|pg||
nt|daman: 11 IMPs to be exact|pg||
nt|april7: claim now|pg||
nt|sybarra: they need a LOT of bid pick ups |pg||
nt|daman: the rally begins.....|pg||
nt|mariner1: might have won the opening @S in dummy and lead @c|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I would have won in dummy and played a diamond to the ace and another, so that must be wrong|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|haans: sad :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: that would have worked also|pg||
pc|c5|nt|andyv:  Fantoni didn't believe 4-1 @hs would be with N|pg||
pc|cA|nt|hedyg: no, @s first|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer develops the spades, not worried if South overruffs from a natural trump trick.|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|pc|c2|nt|lestergold: now no entry left in west for any squeezes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't understand much of this|pg||
nt|cicus: hi Barry|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|andyv:  @d|pg||
pc|d4|nt|brolucius: If the original double guaranteed four spades, then 2@C was OK - to pick up a possible 3-3-4-3 shape with South.|pg||
pc|c6|pc|d6|pc|d9|pg||
nt|daman: cashing out|pg||
nt|hedyg: now @c finesse and ruff @s|pg||

nt|cicus: as for opening 4@H , I expect somewhat risky actions from the underdogs|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: and we did not get any score here|pg||
nt|andyv:  I imagine made 5|pg||
nt|daman: there will definitly be a swing    depends on who is on the winning end|pg||
nt|andyv:  multi 2@d|pg||
nt|lestergold: We are back in business in the slam zone again|pg||
nt|andyv:  and another slam hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: this time its infrangible|pg||
nt|daman: would any of us open 1@H?|pg||
nt|daman: there's that word again|pg||
nt|brolucius: Not after a multi opening. Way too good in most people's books, but not for E-W here.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes I had opened 1@h|pg||
nt|lestergold: i prefer a heart to weak 2- too much outside tehheart suit|pg||
nt|daman: too many syllables    gives me a headache|pg||
nt|hedyg: might not have been exactly as we saw|pg||
nt|Walddk2: East discarded a diamond? Then declarer pitched a winner?|pg||
nt|mariner1: Open Room is in 6@S there|pg||
nt|andyv:  with this vul, even 5@d has to be considered|pg||
nt|brolucius: Twelve tricks can be made in spades.|pg||
nt|haans: 2@D|pg||
nt|jcmax: Lauria I meant :)|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Another 4@H maybe - needs a spade lead to make|pg||
nt|jtr: 4@h looks normal to me in 3rd position|pg||
nt|april7: thats an easy 4@H without competition|pg||
nt|roswolf: a choice of games here|pg||
nt|daman: 4@H?  or 3NT?|pg||
nt|sybarra: likely to pick 4 @H |pg||
nt|bridge_one: sry, i told both team with the best formation - no true - in open room Versace Angelini (i thought Versace Lauria)|pg||
nt|mariner1: well @D postion helped after all|pg||
nt|hedyg: great hand in S|pg||
nt|haans: 6@H|pg||
mb|1D|nt|bridge_one: Failla Attanasio, plying in open room, are clients of BBO - each day Failla play here|pg||
nt|jtr: Here also maybe|pg||
nt|hedyg: i would not pass|pg||
nt|haans: easy to bid|pg||
nt|mariner1: 6@S except for a small issue - 6 @H except for another issue|pg||
mb|1S|nt|brolucius: Commentating.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Double seems normal now|pg||
nt|andyv:  opposite a passed pd, 4@d still leaves a bit too much room to N/S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Most top pairs play take-out double through at least 4@H|pg||
nt|brolucius: It would make the game more interesting if Hedy helped the team that is behind.|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: LOL|pg||
nt|cicus: again, as usual, no upgrade from Fantoni|pg||
mb|d|nt|ralfwil: 6@h on a finess|pg||
nt|brolucius: North might hold 3-3-3-4 shape, a 9-count with no stopper in hearts.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now a possible, hopeless 3NT, bid by Versace-Giubilo in the open room|pg||
mb|3S|nt|lestergold: my weak 2s dont have ak combos outside the trump suit not in forn of  partner im avers to missing gamers|pg||
nt|andyv:  should show max w@hs|pg||
nt|daman: ogusty|pg||
nt|brolucius: West might bid just 2@S, meaning that will be high enough if partner has spades. But they play their multi quite strong (as is apparent), so West bids 2NT with 16 points in case a ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: game is there by sheer power.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree Mike|pg||
nt|lestergold: slam there better than 50%|pg||
nt|Walddk2: or negative doubles if you like|pg||
nt|hedyg: and now?|pg||
nt|hedyg: S has a good hand for playing in @s|pg||
nt|daman: unlikely he will pass|pg||
nt|cuttysark: One of the stronger 1@H overcalls I have seen|pg||
nt|april7: W could overcall 1@S, modern style, but doesn't consume biddingspace|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@c= 14+ nat or 15+ balanced|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@h= @s|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@c= f1|pg||
nt|haans: spec do not like spade lead :)|pg||
nt|jcmax: very good choice of opening bid by giubilo here|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Quite good, yes, but is it worth bidding at the five-level?|pg||
nt|hedyg: however on the bidding @ss might well be 4-1 or even 5-0|pg||
nt|mariner1: 6@C by S?|pg||
nt|mariner1: nice call|pg||
nt|jcmax: it will not be easy for NS to judge the exact right level now|pg||
nt|mariner1: 6@C suggesting a major slam|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It takes a very good day to make it|pg||
mb|4S|nt|lestergold: club finesse or no spade lead too|pg||
nt|andyv:  may get there now|pg||
nt|daman: West might not expect such a good hand|pg||
nt|daman: sorry  :(|pg||
nt|andyv:  dbl again|pg||
nt|bobh1: this one about the same as the last one with one difference|pg||
nt|andyv:  2N=slam killer|pg||
nt|haans: 2@D 18-19?|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@H or 3N both have play here|pg||
nt|cicus: good idea, that double|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now 2@C by North i think is conventional, similar roudy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now Giubilo will double 6@H for the lead|pg||
nt|hedyg: K&R (KQ8654 KJT83 6 7) = 14.00 |pg||
mb|d|nt|hedyg: 1@H could be bid with 0 hcps|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Fantoni has shown 0-11 so far|pg||
nt|andyv:  they will push it to 3@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: a little more work to do here|pg||
nt|daman: I would be a bidder|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I would also pass and bid 5@S now, even considering six|pg||
nt|mariner1: all of Roland's slams are serious (to him) :)|pg||
nt|bobh1: slam makes|pg||
nt|jtr: This is getting unpleasant|pg||
nt|cuttysark: East has done well - he wanted to play in spades!|pg||
nt|cicus: Fantoni is waiting with the axe but Nunes will not cooperate|pg||
nt|Walddk2: At some point he will if they keep bidding|pg||
nt|cicus: there is chance the defence slips though|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: defence on top and this looks tough|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Seems nobody bids their 5-card suits nowadays|pg||
nt|cicus: Rinaldi may not take 2@S as a transfer|pg||
nt|cicus: 2@H, I mean|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: if west makes a try tho east will accept|pg||
nt|hedyg: George pls stop clicking on the commentator's curse button|pg||
nt|brolucius: Six too much, surely?|pg||
nt|bobh1: the hook is on and the @ss are guessable|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 12 tricks on a finess and solving the @s|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@H seems like an unusual call here|pg||
nt|andyv:  anyone know what 4@h is?|pg||
nt|haans: no takers :)|pg||
nt|bobh1: clearly @cs with slam interest lol|pg||
nt|andyv:  a spec says 5@c slam try|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty|pg||
nt|bobh1: 4@s u mean rob|pg||
nt|mariner1: oops yes 4@S|pg||
nt|haans: why not 1D lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Double is the so-called Lightner Double|pg||
nt|jcmax: I am being asked whether W should dbl 6@C conventionally in order to get a different lead|pg||
nt|brolucius: I was not following such a low part score at this time in the morning!|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|sharkey: agree|pg||
nt|odysseus69: I suppose a heart to Jack and diamond to Q|pg||
nt|sharkey: Even if W gets 2 @S tricks cannot see making|pg||
nt|sharkey: may be then - two @D tricks|pg||
nt|bobh1: 4@h might also|pg||
nt|jtr: Odd|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4333   109x in @C AJ10 in @D may be 3Nt better for N|pg||
nt|daman: nice bid|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3@S is rather too high, with potential losers in every suit. 2@S is a good stop.|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes, but would you pass with N hand in balancing position?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Oh dear, that was meant to be private. My secret is out.|pg||
nt|cicus: although it is not likely that E won't switch to a @D after 2 rounds of @Ss|pg||
nt|cicus: we have already known that David|pg||
nt|brolucius: Known, or suspected?|pg||
nt|cicus: known, definitely|pg||
nt|brolucius: Well, I will surprise you then, by watching this 3@C closely.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|brolucius: South's double of 3S was dubious, with two kings in unbid suits.|pg||
nt|daman: the double of 3@S might give him pause to think partner would have values outside @Ss|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@s by W would have gotten a 5@d bid|pg||
nt|jcmax: Intersting the @S suit never got mentioned here. But I guess no need if there is no fit.|pg||
nt|daman: hah!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes David, therefore "considering"|pg||
nt|bobh1: i'm judging by his hand not what i know of their system|pg||
nt|mariner1: Open Room is in 3N here|pg||
nt|bobh1: 4n probably says no interest|pg||
nt|andyv:  i play 4@s as 4-4 minors slam try makes sense to use 4@h as a 5 card minor suit slam try|pg||
nt|bobh1: so NS will get credit for trying but no actual imps most likely|pg||
nt|ralfwil: For me 4nt is what I want to play if partner has any other vision|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in the old days this 3C bid would mnean N knew where their fit was|pg||
nt|mariner1: same spot in Open Room|pg||
nt|Walddk2: "I have a void, partner, find it"|pg||
nt|haans: not clubs not hearts find it|pg||
nt|hedyg: @s more likely than @D|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and not diamonds after South showed both majors|pg||
nt|jcmax: In my opinion no, already because it may have the effect that he will be on lead himself and couldn't dbl for a 1S lead then|pg||
nt|mariner1: in Open Room a @c was led as W was on lead|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lestergold: onbiously they are used to opening heavy multis|pg||
nt|cicus: N relieved|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Lauria will surely lead a spade|pg||
nt|hedyg: not sure why W doubled in OR|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|hedyg: just find A@C in W and ruff 1@H for 6|pg||
nt|daman: Rusinow leads|pg||
nt|mariner1: kibbers suggesting @S lead into 6n makes the slam easier|pg||
nt|haans: 4nt can never be blackwood but maybe Turbo|pg||
nt|mariner1: well now its into 4N|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@D over 3@C would ask for full layout|pg||
nt|cicus: I don't think he felt very optimistic at 2NT vulnerable|pg||
nt|april7: 10 or  11 tricks depends on @D play|pg||
nt|jcmax: Depending on what a dbl of 6@C would have meant in this partnership the dbl over 6@H now could have a very specific meaning|pg||
nt|Walddk2: These guys never get it wrong|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mariner1: Q@S on and 3 3 means no issue here except how many he makes|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3Nt is more probable that 4@S|pg||
nt|jcmax: In case anyone is wondering why N bid 2NT instead of just 3NT, he was probably catering to his partner holding a 6-card @S suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Would seem natural to set up a couple of heart tricks first. He can always come back to spades|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I should pass as N|pg||
nt|hedyg: all his strength is in @c|pg||
pc|c2|nt|andyv:  six no picnic with small @c lead from W and we saw some similar action yesterday those type of leads|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i dont think he will attack spades right away|pg||
pc|c8|nt|daman: nicely done|pg||
nt|jtr: Why not double 2NT?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Can't understand the 2@S bid - if they can open 1@C with 5 diamonds why not give South the chance to rescue himself?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You have to avoid a spade or club lead if you want to defeat 4@H|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I mean the 2@H bid of course|pg||
nt|andyv:  can't win if you pass with those hands|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|brolucius: Pretty neat, anyway, to reach a slam after a multi opening.|pg||
nt|jtr: We knew:)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|sharkey: Since @H is the communication 4th @H may become good|pg||
nt|haans: N may have corrected to 6nt|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jcmax: East's pass over 1@H is also interesting. In my view passing with that kind of hand makes it so much easier for the opponents to come into the bidding|pg||
nt|brolucius: Perhaps he rated Pass and 5@S (removing the double) as stronger than an immediate 5@S. But I'm not sure whether the hand is worth such a meaning. He has few honors in the majors.|pg||
pc|c3|nt|andyv:  4N seems like a shot in the dark... i'd have liked to know about the K of @d on this hand|pg||
nt|cicus: now he makes exactly 3|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Board 1 was flat (as I perdicted :))|pg||
nt|cicus: a healty 6 IMP for Angelini|pg||
nt|cuttysark: North may as well go for the ruff - if decalrer had a second diamond loser he would discard it|pg||
nt|cicus: even if he misses that, S also knows to give N a ruff|pg||
nt|jtr: Spec points out that the @c play could be risky|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i would take by North first trick|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, depending on their agreements, he might also have been interested in knowing if his partner had a diamond fragment to show|pg||
nt|bobh1: now perhaps shift attention to the other major|pg||
nt|jcmax: The opponents are both ducking. Usually a very good idea when ther is no obvious line of defence. Let declarer play something and at the same tim disrupt his communication a bit.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think the case for taking the first trick in dummy is strong. he wants E to be on lead next, noit W|pg||
nt|bridge_one: for this reason was more easy for declarer to keep 2 entry in the dummy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: On the other hand; he is not particularly concerned about a diamond switch|pg||
nt|jtr: I am not sure though|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is the Haman rule,  IF you can play 3 nt.....|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not enough tricks in 6NT |pg||
nt|haans: it is that :)|pg||
nt|milton_se: certainly not an easy make|pg||
nt|cicus: Although I did not know from what contract you follow a hand|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Good morning all - sorry I'm late|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good morning Liz. You did not miss anything fancy|pg||
nt|cicus: gm Liz|pg||
pc|h3|nt|hedyg: do you think this was a pass and pull auction?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|andyv:  he has his 10 tricks and will gain an 11th by just cashing out|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3NT is the right contract here|pg||
nt|daman: he now has a one way @D play because of transportation issues|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ritong: unclear|pg||
nt|marlowepi: what i did NOT say was that the ace was the best play|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Q@S is correct to give the idea to have doubleton|pg||
nt|bobh1: creating the illusion that @ss are foul|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe. i would be concerned about a diamond switch|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Interesting @SQ|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes very interesting|pg||
nt|jcmax: Lauria is a very tricky player! :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: trying to get declarer to change his line|pg||
nt|sybarra: and it works |pg||
pc|c6|nt|daman: yes|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|brolucius: The @H9 lead seemed to make it clear that declarer was about to establish discards on his heart suit. A diamond switch was indicated, wasn't it?|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ritong: but the idea is important|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Looks safe wenough in 3@H?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|hedyg: and play another @H now|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|Walddk2: which he duly did|pg||

nt|Walddk2: or East|pg||
nt|jcmax: There seem to be a lot of 2-suiters.But we have yet to see someone bid one|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S EW has play|pg||
nt|mariner1: can also be beat best defense|pg||
nt|bridge_one: both down if play game|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|andyv:  Rinaldi should have listened to me:)|pg||
nt|mariner1: Q@H drops so 10 @H in pocket, Q@C in pocker.......|pg||
nt|jcmax: The question is: Can EW find out they have a @S-stopper if N bids @S|pg||
nt|cicus: another easy game - Villa not favoured by the dealing machine|pg||
mb|3D|nt|hedyg: that is when you went flying|pg||
nt|april7: without ruffing value E should pass|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5422 is an acceptable pattern for 1NT, not 5-4 in the majors though|pg||
nt|mariner1: pocket|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We could be in for another Gazzilli auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: 1@H would show 14+ points, so Fantoni has to open at the two-level.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Which system do E-W play? Livorno Diamond?|pg||
nt|mariner1: @S lead causes issues if W plays it|pg||
nt|jcmax: But it seems EW are not playing strong club, because now West opened 1@D|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nightmare-ish I suppose|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Michaels and inflation |pg||
nt|sharkey: NS can make 4@C here|pg||
nt|sharkey: Of course 3 NT no problem without @S lead|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 2C=majors- 2D- you pick|pg||
nt|ritong: any imp counts, players like versace play to optimize every board reasonably|pg||
nt|brolucius: With four tens, even a timid bidder such as myself would have opened the North hand.|pg||
nt|daman: 11 HCP   4 10's   2 1/2 quick tricks    would anyone open the North hand/|pg||
nt|andyv:  3N will end it|pg||
nt|mariner1: have to play S for the AJx @D and that is not intuitive|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If only we had their CC, but we don't|pg||
nt|eugenio123: anyway it doesn't seem hard to reach to 4@h|pg||
nt|cicus: I'd probably give it a try myself if I did not regularly played a strong club|pg||
nt|roswolf: i dont like the double by north - perhaps trying to get the last board and set back!?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The open room has it|pg||
nt|brolucius: How delightful to see someone passing the North hand.|pg||
mb|4N|nt|mariner1: 2@S here showing @H and a minor|pg||
nt|april7: needs a 4th @C and a @H less to X|pg||
nt|haans: cue twice|pg||
nt|hedyg: movie says = maybe entries by Roberta were not quite right|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: 4h for sure here|pg||
nt|daman: Roberta said she will correct it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: she has|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n makes too|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3NT also OK.|pg||
nt|daman: thanks Roberta|pg||
nt|mariner1: well there goes the 1@C arguement :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: Kib informs me they bid slam OR as well previous board|pg||
nt|odysseus69: East rushes to pick hearts|pg||
nt|ritong: even if they are not super happy with the contract:)|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N is the spot Open Room|pg||
nt|andyv:  reality gets in the way of these slams|pg||
nt|bobh1: fantoni nunes avoided the bad slam on the first board|pg||
nt|bobh1: wonder if they will bid the one that makes|pg||
nt|haans: slam do not feel natural|pg||
nt|bridge_one: pass by West probably bec open in 3th position|pg||
nt|jcmax: In Italy I believe Ghestem is quite popular, so this may actually specifically show @S+@D|pg||
nt|bobh1: 2n maybe shows some values in the context of having passed|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I am giving it a go at the moment, but it rarley comes up :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes and a lack of aces should devalue the hand too|pg||
nt|bridge_one: dbl means 4@s - with 13hcp need|pg||
mb|5C|nt|ralfwil: 3-3 in @s and find the @dJ will make|pg||
nt|andyv:  W may invite with 4N|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2N asking the minor probably|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: As played by the (in)famous Lanzarotti-Buratti many years ago|pg||
nt|odysseus69: so 2 east West pairs upset by last- 2 N/s pairs jubilant|pg||
nt|daman: I would open|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I would, I am afraid|pg||
nt|jtr: I guess he completes the transer with a weak NT|pg||
nt|cicus: I expected a transfer here|pg||
nt|eugenio123: now I wonder what is 2@h ,they should play transfer |pg||
nt|andyv:  but 4-5 is for Roland:)|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: I UNDESTANDED|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Looks like a weak NT to me :)|pg||
nt|milton_se: he may be as old as us :)|pg||
nt|cicus: 3@H nonforcing, I think|pg||
mb|5D|nt|mariner1: When logic and proportion, Have fallen sloppy dead, And the White Knight is|pg||
nt|mariner1: talking backwards, And the Red Queen's "off with her head!", Remember what|pg||
nt|mariner1: the dormouse said :|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now, is this a transfer or not (look at board 18)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: shows 5-5|pg||
nt|brolucius: This rebid promises five hearts. It is another weakness of standard systems that 3@H can sometimes be a strong hand with only four hearts. Responder may then have to guess what to ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: do next.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: I noticed Minardo bid 1@H over 1@D|pg||
nt|haans: bid slam on this and you will never win|pg||
nt|mariner1: "Bid those Roland slams" :)|pg||
nt|bobh1: i don't think Fantunes will bid this one either|pg||
nt|andyv:  they didn't|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes Ghestem would pinpoint the suits|pg||
nt|jtr: Looks like it is lol|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Pulga thinks it is|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Maybe it is a constructive, not forcing bid? Unlucky that it has wrongsided the game|pg||
nt|cicus: are you sure David  1@D showed @Hs?|pg||
nt|peachy: they may still not be on same wavelength|pg||
nt|jtr: Looks like it|pg||
nt|cuttysark: North thinks it is a transfer. He likes transfers?|pg||
mb|6H|nt|odysseus69: 200 only|pg||
nt|sharkey: beats 130|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Don't be afraid, open|pg||
nt|brolucius: No need to apologize for making a sensible bid.|pg||
nt|daman: OMG  if Roland would open?   then it has to be right :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  they invinted 10-12 NTs for timid bidders|pg||
nt|hedyg: right! we would all open|pg||
nt|andyv:  invented|pg||
nt|hedyg: primes and great spots|pg||
nt|hedyg: plus a 5 card suit|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I know some players who would reach 3NT on the East-West cards|pg||
nt|april7: but its not always good!!!|pg||
nt|jcmax: But as the cards lie 5@D would also make|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Very tough to diagnose the combined spade stopper|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: whenever I do that I end in the 3-3 but they are headed to 3NT here|pg||
nt|daman: I am informed that 1@D promises a 4 card major  otherwise a weak NT 12-14   fixed by the system    is that true?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Meanwhile, E/W have bid the hand commendably - realising that they had no middle cards and staying low.|pg||
nt|mariner1: then 2N asking range?|pg||
nt|bobh1: bad trump break|pg||
nt|bridge_one: normally the pairs who play ghestem in Italy use the exclusion rule (so 3@C means no @C)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i think they use micheal's|pg||
nt|jcmax: My own partnership has recently switched from unspecified 2-suiters to ghestem. We believe in many situation it is just so important to know the 2nd suit|pg||
nt|jtr: Some play that you complete with any minimum hand|pg||
nt|eugenio123: what's going on?|pg||
nt|cicus: S gives up|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
mb|7H|nt|bobh1: if they were down more going in maybe|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the disvantage to play ghestem is to lose 3@C preemptive overcall|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@H is significantly better than 4@S was at the other table|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not a triumph for Gazzilli|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: but 100 on EW|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: ty daman|pg||
nt|daman: what 100 are you referring to Ralf/|pg||
nt|hedyg: must be a relay bid|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N fails on a @S lead from N|pg||
nt|jcmax: if it was Ghestem, then 2N would most likely ask for the range. 3@C would be MIN. And who would disagree with that?:)|pg||
nt|jtr: Well, something is going off|pg||
nt|cicus: he does not want to play 6@H doubled|pg||
nt|jtr: Another discussion will ensue|pg||
nt|cicus: taing away Fantoni's time|pg||
nt|hedyg: should Nunes invite opposite 12-14?|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: understanded =p|pg||
nt|mariner1: Open Room in 5@D here|pg||
nt|ritong: Qx facing Jxx is relatively easy|pg||
nt|ritong: for 0xx is not really possible|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: board 3|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@h down 2|pg||
nt|daman: ok|pg||
nt|sharkey: don't see that N can Dbl this - too risky|pg||
nt|cicus: *taking|pg||
nt|eugenio123: I don't know if they can respect the contract, I guess they can't|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Spectator: Are these guys experts? I understand the question, but they usually are. Everyone can have misunderstandings|pg||
nt|cicus: BTW it seems to me 1@D was some negative reply|pg||
nt|jtr: Nothing makes sense to me|pg||
nt|eugenio123: I know both of them ( Pulga Rinaldi ) and they used to play well|pg||
nt|jtr: Except that 2@h was misunderstood|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Maybe they are not a regular partnership? This does not look like a complicated position|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes, when your pd plays them well|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: N should win and swithch to @Ss -- might be tough|pg||
nt|hedyg: played by W and @s lead in OR|pg||
nt|ritong: QJ for 10xx|pg||
pc|cT|nt|lml: I dont think it was a relay I just dont think he had another good bid|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am told that the E-W names are not really what we see.  East is Minaldo with an  L,   West is Matteucci. Could you check that please, Roberta?|pg||
nt|tendenz: Hi all, 1@H is 3+ cards, 1@S is 3+cards, because they cannot bid 1nt. 1nt is an artificial answer, transfer for @C (weak or strong)|pg||
nt|lml: thanks ... makes sense|pg||
nt|jcmax: Oh so good to have an expert on the system, grazie!!!!|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: itè possible... they can't tell me their name, ty|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They can't?|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty Aldo :)|pg||
nt|jcmax: Is North really pondering over the lead now?|pg||
nt|andyv:  at least 8 tricks in NT|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Sorry, have to leave. so thanks all and bye for now|pg||
nt|xenya: now it's easy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This was the tempo Fantoni needed to set up the diamonds|pg||
nt|hedyg: bye Ralf, ty|pg||
nt|xenya: bye Ralph|pg||
nt|haans: always hard to correct 3nt |pg||
nt|ritong: but here, no overcall|pg||
nt|mariner1: 11 and maybe 12 here|pg||
mc|13|nt|tendenz: You wellcome, I usually play with Matteucci|pg||
nt|hedyg: ah!|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: ty|pg||
nt|ralfwil: In the old days with manual given hands, they always sait that the queen always watched the jack|pg||
nt|andyv:  qj8x....tough lead|pg||
nt|haans: and soon @HQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In the other room declarer went down in 5@D when he pitched a heart on the 3rd round of spades|pg||

pc|s7|pc|s4|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Excellent slam (by my standards). I would be surprised if they don't bid it|pg||
nt|daman: casual*|pg||
nt|hedyg: bd 19 OR in 4@H|pg||
nt|mariner1: nw a slam NS|pg||
nt|cicus: mentally|pg||
nt|eugenio123: it seems to be an easy hand|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Not a great start for Vill Fabbriche - too early in the morning?|pg||
nt|cicus: here comes a good result for them|pg||
nt|roswolf: this hand will be a tempter for n/s|pg||
nt|sybarra: tempting for what?|pg||
nt|andyv:  in OR, N on lead led a @s and declarer went after @hs rather than @ds... down 1|pg||
nt|cuttysark: More Gazzilli in the other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 3N NS here as well|pg||
nt|roswolf: a disaster|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: It should be called a GIB (or Deep Finesse) slam, not a Roland slam.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: You would, of course, take the double diamond finesse Roland - maybe a small entry problem?|pg||
nt|daman: it might be possible with a strong club auction    but a 2@C auction?   do they have the room?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No entry problem|pg||
nt|andyv:  a finesse and a dbl finesse....yes... good slam, Roland:)|pg||
nt|mariner1: now|pg||
nt|daman: there are 4 sessions of bridge left    Fabbriche needs to slowly cip away at the iceberg to the tune of 20 IMPs per session    a tall order but Padova almost did it yeaterday|pg||
nt|sybarra: it just doesnt fit |pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3Nt down with K@S in West - otherwise could be make if opps don't play @H|pg||
nt|daman: chip*|pg||
nt|hedyg: if he goes after @ds and S plays Q@H he is down 2|pg||
nt|hedyg: after the @s lead|pg||
nt|haans: 4-4 in spades would ha be enough|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@H has play here|pg||
nt|brolucius: A spade lead beats 5@D, setting up a spade trick before the club discard is available. |pg||
mb|1H|nt|Walddk2: 1NT 12-14 (in theory)|pg||
nt|andyv:  everyone likes 6@c.....i make bets they don't find that one|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: http://www.bridgewithdan.com/systems/grainger_lavee_nightmare_2005.pdf    Nightmare as played by Grainger-Lavee from Canada|pg||
nt|mariner1: could see action here if anyone gets frisky|pg||
nt|sharkey: Battle of the part scores coming up|pg||
nt|bobh1: vulnerable to a @c ruff but not on this layout|pg||
nt|mariner1: 6@C has an issue with a @D lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: this kind of misfit seems to get people overboard|pg||
nt|milton_se: maybe tough to stay out of 5D|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 1@D = hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@H usually 3-card support|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: ho il co,puter cn tqstiera francese... è tutto messo nel posto sbagliato.... uff|pg||
nt|jcmax: non preoccuparti roberta.:)|pg||
nt|mariner1: well seems no one will on this auction|pg||
nt|odysseus69: conservative 3D bid unless it sahows full values|pg||
nt|Walddk2: even 4@C is too high|pg||
nt|sharkey: N's making up for it by overbidding|pg||
nt|carleone22: oynuyosun su topu :)|pg||
nt|jcmax: This will not be easy to bid in my view|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Franchi Montanari are juniores|pg||
nt|jcmax: we can all see slam makes. But how should it be bid?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: many asked about that|pg||
nt|daman: South should pass|pg||
mb|2H|nt|daman: a classic Roland slam|pg||
nt|brolucius: Let's see if West can visualize a slam now...|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3NT is an alternative contract.|pg||
nt|cicus: tough. hard to evaluate @CKQ not knowing partner's shortness|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: 4H not a hopeless contract to b in but would fail here maybe by even two tricks|pg||
nt|andyv:  nice fitting hands and a very nebulous 4@h which might be bid if E/W were vul|pg||
nt|jcmax: do we know how strong the 1NT opening is?|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1NT 12-15|pg||
nt|mariner1: they can beat 2@H however should N dbl? not to me|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think he should pass|pg||
nt|mariner1: just a little different dist EW and this would make|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am lost|pg||
nt|sharkey: S thinking slam...|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 4H?|pg||
nt|sharkey: How many points in this deck of cards?|pg||
nt|sharkey: N not done - or...?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1@D 4cards|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes kibbers are calling for 6@D|pg||
nt|jcmax: The key issue is probably the singleton @S|pg||
nt|bobh1: 6@d makes not 6@c|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@H does not necessarily show hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 3@d might make|pg||
nt|sybarra: calm heads prevailed here|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2nt or 3@C would be bid by a sizeable section of players when they should just pass|pg||
mb|2S|nt|odysseus69: will west lie|pg||
nt|hedyg: Roland said jacks should be worth 1/2 hcp|pg||
nt|andyv:  1@h=xfer to @s|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@s now is usefull for all ...|pg||
nt|bobh1: to figure that out you'd need to see the opp's hands|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3Nt 4@c i think|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now a push|pg||
nt|brolucius: You would have to offer odds of six T-shirts to one, to get any takers.|pg||
nt|andyv:  i'd have to borrow them from Roland|pg||
nt|brolucius: If South leads a low spade, this will make life easy in 3NT.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: conservatism will pay here|pg||
nt|lestergold: need t uess spade to make 9 tricks|pg||
nt|brolucius: When there was a slight pause, I thought the players were taking a smoking break. This reminded me of an item of news today that RyanAir were going to sell no-smoke cigarettes on ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: their flights (£6 for 6), which give you some nicotine when you suck on them. I wonder if this product will be allowed at bridge tables.|pg||
nt|mariner1: nice discilined pass|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@C shape inquiry|pg||
nt|cicus: 30 HCP balanced, but @S109 makes a big difference|pg||
nt|brolucius: You said you had 16 yesterday.|pg||
nt|andyv:  moi?  never!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now he confirms hearts|pg||
nt|haans: hearts or max|pg||
mb|4S|nt|daman: I understand Roberta |pg||
nt|daman: do you have shares in that stock david/|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, she said (I guess) that all the scoring problems are due to using a French computer.|pg||
nt|sharkey: My assumptions about part scores is wrong|pg||
nt|daman: I put my money on 3 NT    maybe 4NT at most|pg||
nt|jcmax: So now N bid 3@S. does S know this is the A? I would say not and expect 3NT|pg||
nt|bridge_one: fix @C interst for slam|pg||
nt|bobh1: if 3@c is anything close to natural, N has a nice hand|pg||
nt|bridge_one: and now 4@c|pg||
nt|bobh1: 4@c now would tend to say that 3@s was the A|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Spade  5|pg||
nt|andyv:  i was still into cokes... didn't realize everyone changed to t-shirts:)|pg||
mb|d|nt|sharkey: the battle that is|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not sure why they are not bidding the hands they are dealt, says a spectator. He may have a point|pg||
nt|odysseus69: they are playing a game with which I am not familiar- a famous quote|pg||
nt|hedyg: so he really has very little|pg||
nt|mariner1: there is a replay of the Tour @D'Italia on TV now so all I need is some pasta and|pg||
nt|mariner1: vino :)|pg||
nt|cicus: they can try 4@H which also fails|pg||
nt|cicus: 1NT was limited to 9 HCPs|pg||
nt|brolucius: On @CJ lead, it seems that 3NT makes. If North wins with the ace, declarer has nine tricks. If he ducks, declarer can develop a second heart trick.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: it was too  much to bid vulnerable without a clear fit|pg||
nt|andyv:  3N|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I offer a beer if less than 10 tricks|pg||
nt|andyv:  same contract in OR so only wondering if any imp swings|pg||
nt|andyv:  martini, Ralf|pg||
nt|jcmax: Since EW no doubt will get to 4@H, maybe we can discuss the right technical play of the @H suit here|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcmax: it depends on what double means. Optional would be good here promising at least 3@H and the majority of hcp. The Polish like to play that way.|pg||
nt|bobh1: i'm guessing 11|pg||
nt|haans: seems fair|pg||
nt|haans: 11|pg||
nt|brolucius: My lawyers will check the transcript from yesterday.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Fantoni refuses to cue bid with an aceless hand|pg||
nt|jtr: Checking for the @s Quee soon i guess|pg||
pc|c5|nt|hedyg: sure|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Disappointing. They can't win if they don't bid their cold slams|pg||
nt|daman: J10's are worth 3/4 of a point|pg||
nt|hedyg: puppet sequence|pg||
nt|andyv:  W has nothing to offer|pg||
pc|cT|nt|sharkey: perhaps they're counting Vienna points?|pg||
nt|brolucius: A brave gamble, George. Do you have Scottish ancestors?|pg||
nt|daman: none|pg||
nt|hedyg: must have|pg||
nt|daman: 100% Irish|pg||
nt|bobh1: lauria is tricky but not that tricky|pg||
nt|mariner1: Open Room EW are in 4@H DBL here|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now 4@S means A, otherwise another bid|pg||
nt|jcmax: don't underestimate him! )|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i dont know if they play turbo with @C trump|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|cuttysark: We are not mean - just careful|pg||
nt|andyv:  meanwhile on board 19, S did get to 4@hs|pg||
nt|jtr: How do we play this @s suit?  Odds must be close|pg||
nt|cicus: spades lie most favourably, even after a @D ruff you won't lose 2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: How would you play the hand on say a club lead?|pg||
nt|cicus: take in hand and lead a small spade to 10|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Playing the spade suit for one loser is not the only problem|pg||
nt|haans: be right|pg||
nt|jcmax: How to play any suit among other things depends first of all on how many tricks one needs in that suit.|pg||
nt|cicus: hand is simply too hard to solve|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Where it is clear that no-one has 4 spades it is correct to lead an honour - lead small so as not to give declarer 3 tricks when he has 4|pg||
pc|h6|nt|andyv:  odd line of play|pg||
nt|hedyg: opposite 12 really not enough|pg||
nt|brolucius: Surprise, surprise!|pg||
nt|daman: the difference between a Scotsman and a canoe?     A canoe tips|pg||
pc|h9|nt|bobh1: wrong slam from the wrong side|pg||
nt|bobh1: unlucky for them|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 6@C depending by the auction - impossible North can have cards to make 7, and North must have one hoght card in a minor to bid in this way|pg||
nt|bobh1: from any side but from this side lead is obvious|pg||
nt|bridge_one: @D lead is possible after the auction|pg||
nt|bridge_one: West know @H is stopped by south (3NT),|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Ace and small to the queen is best|pg||
pc|hK|nt|bobh1: i think when your hand is that barren you have to get desperate|pg||
nt|cicus: if good news, ruff @D otherwise go for hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You also need a 12th trick from somewhere|pg||
nt|jtr: Well you have other chances if you just pick up the @ss|pg||
nt|jtr: @hs or @ds|pg||
nt|cicus: I did not think it was so hard though|pg||
nt|brolucius: A surprising lapse by the Italian maestros. The last pair you would expect to reach such a contract.|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|daman: weird|pg||
nt|bridge_one: playing for doubleton in @s in South|pg||
nt|jtr: Lets see how the master tackles it anyway|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Slowly?|pg||
nt|cicus: let's see how Fantoni does it, I assume he's going to choose best line|pg||
nt|milton_se: now we know how they will spend the afternoon ...|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jcmax: This is unlucky in my view. It should be better odds to play in your longer suit. But now it is lucky again because the @D was not led.|pg||
pc|s7|nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|jtr: @ss 3-2 with an honour onside then you can set up the 5th @h|pg||
nt|cicus: they have already had a misunderstending 2 days ago, playing in 5@D instead of cold 10 tricks at NT|pg||
pc|sK|nt|lestergold: now off?|pg||
nt|daman: yep|pg||
nt|lestergold: fantunes wont let this make now|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I don´t understand declarers choice in 2@h|pg||
nt|lestergold: it was an obvious danger why not play safely for his contract|pg||
nt|hedyg: i trust Lauria|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree David! some kind of misunderstanding|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Anyway, it will be a flat board now|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok, and Roland too|pg||
nt|Walddk2: there is another line that is as good as the one I suggested|pg||
nt|Walddk2: low to the queen first|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and if it loses, finesse on the way back|pg||
nt|haans: you look funny if N had single K|pg||
nt|brolucius: West must have shown a strong @H/@D hand, but if 4@C was then a cue-bid agreeing diamonds, it was an amazing overbid.|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|cuttysark: Lead suggests hearts are not breaking|pg||
pc|dK|nt|bobh1: is it garozzo who says "always lead your singleton"|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i would lead @S the same - difficult @D lead will work after the auction|pg||
nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
pc|d4|nt|Walddk2: I once tried to buy something in England for a £5 note issued by the Bank of Scotland. "No way, we don't accept foreign currency", said the salesman|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|brolucius: Racist jokes would cost you a suspended prison sentence over here. |pg||
pc|s8|nt|lml: +100 will be a fine score|pg||
nt|hedyg: happened to me too :(|pg||
nt|jtr: If an honour pops up by Sotuh then you can ruff a @d|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s3|nt|lestergold: it is amazing to see this sort of error at this level|pg||
nt|bobh1: by the time he reaches the decision in @hs he will have 9 in the bag|pg||
nt|jtr: 4-2 is ok|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We have a ruling on board 18|pg||
nt|jtr: Oh?|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|cicus: really?|pg||
pc|d9|nt|brolucius: Your fault for accepting the note in the first place. I wouldn't.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Tell us more|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The percentage is roughly the same. 70%|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ralfwil: But with @hH, there was no hurry with @cA|pg||
pc|d8|nt|daman: baffles the mind|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|c3|nt|Walddk2: By the way, they don't have to accept Scottish notes in England. The banks must, though|pg||
nt|andyv:  8@s|pg||
nt|bobh1: and his table presence will enable him to get he @hs right|pg||
pc|h2|pc|c4|nt|andyv:  something's gone awry|pg||
nt|lestergold: only the contract|pg||
nt|daman: yes  undo needed|pg||
nt|lestergold: input error operator?|pg||
nt|cicus: something wrong here|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|sharkey: so 500 to Baroni-Golin|pg||
nt|andyv:  it would be suicidal to take @h hook...but W's tank certainly clearing up the picture|pg||
nt|Walddk2: ruling on board 18. 3@H-1 becomes 3@Dx-2, so not 7, but 12 IMPs tor Angelini. |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Wrong explanation|pg||
nt|jtr: Now just @hs 4-2 as i said|pg||
nt|cicus: hmm|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I hear that in Itay they have done away with Appeals Committees|pg||
nt|jtr: Wow i dont understand that ruling|pg||
nt|cicus: wrong or not, Nunes should have X-ed 2NT, he has it set in his own hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So you may add 5 IMPs to the Angelini score. We can't do that through the software|pg||
nt|brolucius: There was another deal in this match where declarer needed the king and queen of a suit to fall singleton, to make his slam.|pg||
nt|milton_se: high C of course|pg||
nt|cicus: and did they fall?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Unfortunately not, on that occasion.|pg||
nt|cicus: there were 3 out in the suit :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: No it was around 5 or 6, as here.|pg||

nt|daman: Roland took my bet on the final contract   he owes me another BBO T-shirt (autographed, of course)|pg||
nt|haans: E did no play any diamonds|pg||
nt|bobh1: will this gain an imp?|pg||
nt|andyv:  2 imps|pg||

nt|cuttysark: A second opinion?|pg||
nt|sybarra: ooops no |pg||
nt|sybarra: push |pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  needed E/W hands flipped for squeeze|pg||
nt|haans: good play in spades|pg||
nt|hedyg: did she?|pg||
nt|ritong: was it daniela?|pg||
nt|mariner1: 6@H ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: wel congrats anyhow :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: good point Victor - S was probably so sure 5@C wud make the thought didnt occur to her|pg||
nt|cuttysark: They had better accept my notes in England!|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i would be surprised if benito's principle was quite as general as that. more likely:  lead your side-suit singleton when you have 2-3 trumps|pg||
nt|cicus: well at the Bermuda Bowl plaers were discouraged fom appealing|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@C  14+ with clubs or 15+ balanced. Forcing|pg||
nt|jtr: 5@d was quickly defeated next door|pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s seem to have got a little too high for no real reason in the other room|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: If anything interesting happens on this deal, I am a Dutchman.|pg||
nt|andyv:  get the shoes out, David|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N has play EW|pg||
nt|lml: its always nice to have a new toy|pg||
nt|jcmax: Anyway, I was saying that in my view the Poles are the best in this world at doubling cooperatively. The Italians are good when one has a takeout dbl that the other one can pass.|pg||
nt|hedyg: Fantoni did not bother to play @c when in with A@s, he switched to @H, might go down in 4 @H now|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2NT usually played as forcing to game (in spades) nowadays. Some used to play it as at least a game-try.|pg||
nt|andyv:  E defense a bit soft... should have taken @d and led back @s|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Yes, but there the TDs consulted|pg||
nt|cicus: true|pg||
nt|cuttysark: One wonders why 5@D rather than 5@C|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@S  0-11  no 4-card major|pg||
nt|jtr: East could maybe have given the option with 4NT on the bidding next door|pg||
nt|cicus: west bid a natural 1@D in OR|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@s X vs failing 4@H|pg||
nt|andyv:  N/S may get pushed to 4@s|pg||
nt|andyv:  cards certainly don't suggest they bid it freely|pg||
nt|mariner1: do not think this is biddable though...........|pg||
nt|haans: bal 18-19|pg||
mb|1H|nt|cicus: 2@C for me now would be majors|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 5@C/@D down always|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1Nt weak for E/W|pg||
nt|mariner1:  a true Roland slam|pg||
nt|jcmax: In a slam ofc. There was big discussion at the time whether Roland's 2nd line was right or his 1st. The 2nd wouldn't have worked. Luckily she chose the 2nd, we won the match and ...|pg||
nt|jcmax: later the whole event. Small difference. :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  1S xfer to NT|pg||
nt|sharkey: Back to good ole 3 NT|pg||
nt|andyv:  which is what happened in OR... now S doesn't have 9 tricks without risking contract|pg||
nt|jcmax: I know only one thing: it is impossible to always find the winning lead.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: may be pass|pg||
nt|jtr: Lauria found a great lead I wonder why South didnt bid 4@h for the lead?|pg||
nt|cicus: 1NT does that for them, hopefully|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Have they discussed 1NT I wonder|pg||
nt|jtr: South is wondering too|pg||
nt|peachy: I was just about to wonder the same|pg||
nt|cuttysark: North seems determined to test partner's knowledge of the system|pg||
nt|peachy: it must be frustrating for all 4 players when one side is on shaky footing|pg||
nt|cicus: it is entirely plausible with the S hand that N has a strong NT|pg||
nt|cicus: but he is going to check for a major anyway :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: A great word: missklikkato!|pg||
mb|1S|nt|cuttysark: How? by doubling?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Maybe 3@D is natural and he can roll out the cuebid whatever it means|pg||
nt|hedyg: but here N did not bid|pg||
nt|brolucius: Hard to imagine N/S getting into the bidding now, even if West were to pass 2@H (which is unlikely).|pg||
nt|hedyg: all pass 2@D with N hand?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes!|pg||
nt|jcmax: No, it wasn't Daniela, it was Andrea Rauscheid.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: eay 3N here |pg||
nt|daman: it was corrected to -1|pg||
nt|mariner1: not a lot here for anyone|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: sorry|pg||
nt|cicus: depends on agreement, now 3@D is surely something unnatural|pg||
nt|Walddk2: N-S are making it very hard on themselves I think. It's tough enough to play against these guys, so when you add self-inflicted pressure, you are in dire straits|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Yesterday we had Wet, Wet, Wet. Today it is Dire Straits. Switch to the music channel|pg||
nt|andyv:  i never pass, Hedy so you know it's an unfair question|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol sry|pg||
nt|milton_se: was about to say the same :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: sorry|pg||
nt|cicus: it is a past perfect tense form of misklikkare|pg||
nt|brolucius: Past participle.|pg||
nt|cicus: that's it|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Do you think double was a transfer to spades?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|cuttysark: many pairs play that East must show his singleton here - but the final contract would be the same|pg||
nt|brolucius: East's 4S (on a relatively good hand) rather suggests that West had not already forced to game.|pg||
nt|ritong: caviezel estimated that his @cs were not worth a mention|pg||
nt|jcmax: N will not be unhappy to have stopped so low when he sees dummy|pg||
nt|cicus: should show 4+|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  sorry, 10 tricks|pg||
nt|bobh1: another 3n|pg||
nt|mariner1: W showing good discipline|pg||
nt|ritong: okay|pg||
nt|cicus: as in a hand before|pg||
nt|cicus: hand 1|pg||
mb|5D|nt|odysseus69: cards friendly here|pg||
nt|andyv:  this time passing is a winner|pg||
nt|andyv:  and Villa should get a few imps here|pg||
nt|brolucius: N/S will be pleased to have been shut out of the bidding when the heart break comes to light.|pg||
nt|haans: if 3nt was 5-5 in M on you go|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3NT= 5-5 majors|pg||
nt|ritong: cuz daniela made a great match vs french teal in final|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Her surname at the time; later she became Andrea Reim, isn't that correct?|pg||
nt|ritong: team*|pg||
nt|brolucius: Some play that 1@S (by responder) shows 4 or more and that a negative double denies four spades.|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  sorry, David...Hedy corrected me:  clogs|pg||
nt|jcmax: yes, correct|pg||
nt|cuttysark: They appear to be dicing with death here|pg||
nt|cicus: 1NT probably denies 3 spades|pg||
mb|5S|nt|cuttysark: Not a difficult game, this one|pg||
nt|jtr: They reached the correct contract What a surprise:)|pg||
nt|cicus: S may have intended his pass as forcing|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm e/w got too high too|pg||
nt|april7: 1 down|pg||
nt|bridge_one: anytime to be aggressive don't work|pg||
nt|hedyg: quick switch to @s|pg||
nt|andyv:  tempting against these two to bid 4@s with N hand over 4@h... you just have to believe they make everything they bid:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@c sets @h and shows a good hand (4@h wld be min),  4@d trf|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Fortunately West has only 5 hearts, and di not lead one|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am told: N/A play dbl 4/5 @s and 1@s take out without @s|pg||
nt|brolucius: N/S|pg||
nt|cicus: a stopper is as strong as it sounds|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: anybody bid 2@d in E?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: this one is declarer-proof|pg||
nt|jtr: Not that it is particularly good|pg||
nt|mariner1: Open Room also in 4 in W though|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: you can have another cup of tea David|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am still waiting for something interesting to happen on the deal. Only then, will I seek some suitable forfeit.|pg||
nt|andyv:  better be quick!|pg||
nt|brolucius: They will get it right. I am sure.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: NOT leading a dim might hold this to 9 tricks|pg||
nt|lml: East might have opened|pg||
nt|andyv:  6 boards...6 pretty flat hands....Angelini lucky to be even at this point|pg||
nt|haans: @D lead|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mariner1: Q@D being off is key to total tricks here|pg||
nt|lml: I would open 1@d|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sharkey: The first IMP exchange occured on board 4 - Posillipo picking up 5 IMPs - the missed undertrick costing 2 IMPs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The club layout is so nice that you can make all four tricks|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@d may be different fron normal transfert|pg||
pc|sK|nt|daman: we all thought the last hand was easy and look what happened|pg||
nt|brolucius: Obvious that discards were coming on the diamonds and North's @C8 will have been discouraging.|pg||
nt|andyv:  i would play A@s and @s... don't want pd to even think about @c return|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Count 8 tricks, take 8 tricks :)|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|ralfwil: my guess is 10. S is endplayed |pg||
nt|tendenz: me too|pg||
nt|jcmax: if it's natural it seems like a good idea. would it be natural?|pg||
pc|d6|nt|lestergold: indeed we werent expeting declarer to play a misere line tho|pg||
nt|tendenz: it's natural|pg||
nt|daman: pretty simple|pg||
nt|hedyg: Nunes was a tad too strong for the 2@d opening, maybe that is why he bid 4@h|pg||
pc|d7|nt|marlowepi: as opposed to the other kind|pg||
pc|s4|nt|roswolf: now they will a spade ruff as well|pg||
nt|brolucius: Good bid in 3rd seat, even so.|pg||
nt|hedyg: nonsystemic|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@h great contract|pg||
nt|andyv:  Fantoni's fault for not having the 10 of @hs|pg||
nt|hedyg: did the 2@H bid promise the 10?|pg||
nt|andyv:  only if it meant making the contract!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No, but you forgot to guide them|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3rd seat 2@D opening is 6-13|pg||
nt|brolucius: Which is why North could not contemplate 2@S (weak over weak).|pg||
nt|andyv:  I agree...2@s would lead to some serious partnership discussions afterwards|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|sT|nt|mariner1: 18-20 2+ or natural|pg||
nt|ritong: what are we doing with cards in hand, manoli?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Surprising he did not try to slip through a club to the king. Worth a try.|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@hs made in OR|pg||
nt|cicus: but makes|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Lucky that both diamonds are onside, and dummy has enough club entries for the double finesse|pg||
pc|s9|nt|lestergold: they dont have an embankmant in italy to sleep on|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a @c lead had made it more difficult for declarer to take more than 9 tricks|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@D probably a Stayman|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|hedyg: open 1@D. bid 2@ds...|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|odysseus69: wont be able to repeat club finesse safely|pg||
nt|jcmax: @C lead here is excellent because it doesn't give declarer anything from the start. and he doesn't have a lot of dummy entries to play towards his hand|pg||
nt|cicus: but leaD Does not matter here|pg||
pc|d8|nt|april7: not really, will be more|pg||
nt|andyv:  in the OR, W opened 1N and N was able to get @ss in the 2nd round|pg||
nt|haans: playing safe|pg||
pc|dT|nt|mariner1: 18-20 would be balanced we saw|pg||
pc|s7|nt|lestergold: u know that place where bridge players who dont draw trumps endup sleeping on|pg||

nt|jcmax: I can only repeat what I said 3 minutes ago :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N makes or should make NS|pg||
nt|cicus: fat scores for EW|pg||
nt|jtr: Luck, as ever, favours the team playing better|pg||
nt|jtr: And 4@s here is certainly lucky!|pg||
nt|cicus: extremely , and still on a guess !|pg||
nt|cuttysark: needs a good guess in clubs: East cashed two red aces, then underled, but Lauria got it right (doesnt he always)|pg||
nt|jtr: ah possible|pg||
nt|jtr: Spec says maybe 1NT X|pg||
nt|cicus: I wonder if Nunes upgrades|pg||
nt|jtr: Great looking 14|pg||
nt|cicus: this is an excellent 14 count|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, he might open 1@C|pg||
nt|jtr: Compared to that crap 11 of Fantoni's|pg||
nt|cicus: I noticed he does not usually upgrade though|pg||
nt|cicus: they like their 1NT opening|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the multiway transfert are used a lot in the last times|pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks straightforward too|pg||
nt|hedyg: you might like to check out Dan Neill's write-up of the Fantunes system: http://bridgewithdan.com/systems/Fantoni_Nunes.txt|pg||
mb|1D|nt|Walddk2: They both do frequently, so 11-14 is more like it|pg||
nt|haans: after 2 round of @H know that|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: i mean you put yourself in Fantunes pasta machine and they make bolognese fo u quickly|pg||
nt|daman: whew|pg||
nt|mariner1: many precision pairs use a @H relay over a neg @D response to show the|pg||
nt|mariner1: different NT range by opener|pg||
nt|mariner1: another quiet 1N EW here?|pg||
nt|tendenz: 1@c is 15 or more nightmarish|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@S a lucky make|pg||
nt|daman: I'm glad this is a close match (hope that doesn't curse one team)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Spare me from those who would find an excuse not to open 2@S on the South cards.|pg||
nt|ritong: right david  the way he played that hand, we can safely say that manoli is not very easy with vugraph|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S NS|pg||
nt|cicus: now it is less easy for NS|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No more transfers, please|pg||
nt|jtr: Some people are unused to defending against a weak NT|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Surely this is a double??|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@s may be 10/12|pg||
nt|haans: did not ruff a spade|pg||
nt|brolucius: East's redouble, at the other table (over North's negative double), is usually played as showing a high honour doubleton, so partner can lead the suit. With heart support, you ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: would give some sort of raise instead.|pg||
mb|1H|nt|roswolf: north may pass at the score to generate a swing|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcmax: I only would expect NS to bid to 3NT if S for some reason had chosen to open 3@C|pg||
nt|jtr: Surely this is a pass?:)|pg||
nt|eugenio123: I hope rinaldi passes|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Rinaldi checking to see if this is a transfer|pg||
nt|jtr: lolol|pg||
nt|cicus: hmm, I was sure E takes some rescue action|pg||
nt|sybarra: unfurtunately not best idea this time |pg||
nt|brolucius: When you are deciding whether to bid on a hand such as North's a good rule is: Pass with good spades only when you intend to pass a re-opening double by partner.|pg||
nt|jcmax: Will Lauria transfer to @C or pass?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|andyv:  3N|pg||
nt|cuttysark: maybe he knows you are commentating Henri :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: LOLOL|pg||
nt|ritong: possible|pg||
nt|ritong: although i do not pretend to be the meanest guy:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But Fantoni's pass is|pg||
nt|sybarra: *unfortunately|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i am not sure 2@s 10/12 (with 2@D weaker multi) but many pair in Italy use this system|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the cards of N/S are in perfect fit|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes|pg||
nt|april7: N might inquire about a singleton if possible, and finds the perfect fit to bid 4|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 1@S a relay to 1N?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@S denies a 4-card major|pg||
nt|odysseus69: well done East responding|pg||
nt|jtr: West will maybe?|pg||
nt|hedyg: prefer 1NT by N?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ralfwil: another easy 3nt|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@C is Gazzilli|pg||
nt|bridge_one: also E/W play 4@D|pg||
nt|milton_se: y, but H lead is still correct if South has KJx|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Either natural or any 16+ hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Pass = less than 8 hcp|pg||
nt|ritong: concurrence is severe...|pg||
nt|brolucius: I see that you have co-commentated with David Burn, then.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3Nt not so long to make - with Jxx in @c North would try, perhaps|pg||
nt|marlowepi: even the most macho N would be unlikely to overcall 1NT with the N hand:)|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Maybe they play a compulsory redouble - East will pull now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: weak hand with both minors|pg||
nt|Walddk2: redouble is forced|pg||
nt|eugenio123: maybe now they play inverted dbl so rinaldi may bid dbl|pg||
nt|jtr: Not so easy to catch them now|pg||
nt|cicus: I play T/O X-s in this situation|pg||
nt|jtr: Some play X as specifically 3 cards|pg||
nt|cicus: this hand qualifies :)|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mariner1: @c lead helps the defense|pg||
nt|hedyg: he might not lead @c now|pg||
nt|brolucius: Not quite, on that hand, but I would on other hands.|pg||
nt|andyv:  and the conservative style pays off again|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Don't know why Golin did not blast 4@S before|pg||
nt|brolucius: East's double of 1NT, in the pass-out seat, was quite a clever move. It was based on his @HA-Q-J lying over the heart bid. It went unrewarded on this occasion. |pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  NT 12-14?|pg||
nt|lestergold: cards vey favourable indee for e/w reverse north and south and Fantunes would be making chopped liver of them|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You don't want to invite with that hand, do you?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: thats too conservative unless forcing|pg||
nt|ritong: inter alia, yes|pg||
nt|andyv:  W returned 3rd @s in OR, now same squeeze except this time in @D and @h for 11 tricks|pg||
nt|andyv:  bidding was much more vigorous in the OR by both sides|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well you dont get too many free gelatos from these two|pg||
nt|daman: maybe a little spumoni|pg||
nt|ralfwil: W must watch his communications|pg||
nt|brolucius: I did not realise this was a cookery broadcast.|pg||
nt|andyv:  should go after @ds first|pg||
nt|lestergold: you dont realise a lot of things David|pg||
nt|brolucius: This is true.|pg||
nt|lestergold: you play against fantunes you get ur goose cooked|pg||
nt|daman: and all the hands are not chopped liver|pg||
nt|lestergold: some of them are schmaltz herring|pg||
nt|daman: don't be so wishy-washy Henri   take a view|pg||
nt|andyv:  you got your @d lead, Haans|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|xenya: Versace's 5@D in the OR looks an overbid to me|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mariner1: 3@C should be no problem here|pg||
pc|c4|nt|cuttysark: You could feel this coming on - he willnot be comfortable with this contract|pg||
nt|andyv:  2nd dbl not recommended for faint at heart|pg||
pc|c8|nt|Walddk2: This is getting one-sided|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and may not go the distance (96 boards)|pg||
nt|cicus: only good thing for Fabbriche is that there are 4 1/2 segments left to play|pg||
nt|cuttysark: To be fair, this is not a great game|pg||
nt|bridge_one: ok, 2@S is weak , not 10/12 for N/S - so natural the pass by N|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think it's forcing|pg||
nt|odysseus69: yes 4s is a bit lucky but East is very minimal|pg||
nt|hedyg: W in OR felt obliged to rebid ( 3 @S) , N doubled ( is that not penalty?) and S bid 5@d|pg||
nt|andyv:  certainly needed some luck to bring it in|pg||
nt|andyv:  S actually bid 4@d and N raised to 5|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, 5@D looks to be too much. He has already shown good values with the double and he has no diamond support.|pg||
nt|xenya: no, S bid only 4, but N raised|pg||
nt|andyv:  probably out of annoyance that pd pulled his dbl:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: well with 2 aces that was the least he could do|pg||
pc|h4|nt|Walddk2: Must be since Baroni cue bid|pg||
nt|sharkey: W may take 4@D as cue... - since no @C cue no damage|pg||
nt|jcmax: In my view N has no reason whatsoever to bid 3N on this auction. Partner is super maximum for bidding3@C now. but he just didn't have a different bid|pg||
nt|eugenio123: I don't understand 2@s, if they play t/o dbl he should've bid dbl, if they don't he should've bid pass ( in my opinion )|pg||
pc|hK|nt|cuttysark: Versace taking his trick|pg||
nt|haans: better leads when you see all the cards|pg||
pc|h3|nt|hedyg: Versace would love to lead trump..|pg||
nt|brolucius: Nor would 3NT be... and he had to do something. North will claim the credit for this large number. 'You liked my 3@S bid, partner?' |pg||
pc|h2|pg||
mc|9|nt|jcmax: The @C suit constitutes a suit combination where many players bang down the ace and then play another one. The correct technical play is actually to finesse twice.|pg||

nt|odysseus69: anagram (nearly) for lollipops|pg||
nt|andyv:  so far,not a part score day|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the fact that partner suppoirted the suit does not really strengthen the case for a diamond lead. first, dummy is likely short, so declarer has diamond length. secondly, you want S ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: to have WASTED DIAMOND STRENGTH --if the hand is pure you are not likely to beat the contract|pg||
nt|bridge_one: playing 2@S weak AQJ10 and Q10xx out are a very good hand - |pg||
nt|brolucius: And he had bid 4@D instead of 3NT, suggesting a hole in the diamonds.|pg||
nt|hedyg: i hate it when pd pulls my penalty double|pg||
nt|andyv:  if pd had a 4 loser hand, he certaily bid it very weakly:)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|mariner1: EW just need to stay low here|pg||
nt|andyv:  and 4@h seems to be the order of the day here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 10-13  5+ diamonds, unbalanced|pg||
nt|roswolf: when you are well behind in a match i have a principle to never be max for my bid but always to upgrade - this way you can generate some action without risking too much|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 2@S now would be invitational with 4+ cards. He may have a better option, not sure|pg||
mb|2C|nt|lestergold: Roland has been hacking into the dealing bot again|pg||
nt|lestergold: why did I say that?|pg||
nt|ritong: ugh|pg||
nt|brolucius: East will not have the worst suit ever for 1@S, since we once saw on BBO an overcall on 6-5-4-3-2. Oh, he has bid Michaels instead.|pg||
nt|mariner1: no games however someone could be shoved up|pg||
nt|cicus: no excitement here, a flat-loking 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: grand here?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 7 in 3 different way here|pg||
nt|mariner1: well that is a shove :)|pg||
nt|haans: how to know 3 defensive tricks in @D?|pg||
nt|hedyg: double looks right|pg||
nt|ritong: a kind of all in move, yes|pg||
nt|mariner1: phantom save coming?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|brolucius: You did not point out, Mike, that Nunes has doubled in the 'sandwich position'.|pg||
nt|lestergold: thats enough food - Ed|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6NT can make double dummy, but I doubt that it will in real life|pg||
nt|ritong: worse|pg||
nt|daman: would we all bid 2@H?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Quite so - but this may excape the axe if West bids 2@S|pg||
nt|mariner1: 7@H 7@D or 7N|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Doesn't look like it. He does have good cards, but not oposite a singleton spade|pg||
nt|eugenio123: 4@S should be easy to be bid|pg||
nt|cicus: seems 5@H save goes for 500|pg||
nt|eugenio123: after he knows the support|pg||
nt|sybarra: and versace upgraded and our table did not  |pg||
nt|roswolf: therefore i would have opened 1@S NOT 2|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with a trick (A@S) and 6/4 good 1@s seam more correct that 2@S|pg||
nt|andyv:  sever 2/1 bidders just fainted|pg||

mb|p|nt|haans: p may even be short in spades|pg||

nt|hedyg: hi Adam :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Adam:)|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Adam|pg||
nt|brolucius: There is some play for a min-suit game but, as we see, the diamonds are badly placed. Also, entries to the South hand are limited.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The average age of commentators will be considerably lower after Adam arrived|pg||
nt|hedyg: as in S hand is limited|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: QJx@s though gives 5@c a small hope|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
nt|marlowepi: actually stopping in 7 is an underbid|pg||
mb|4N|nt|fabsayc: undo|pg||
nt|lestergold: but what has roland been up to?|pg||
nt|andyv:  1N seems to do better justice to the W hand|pg||
nt|sharkey: Of course - :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, 2@H looks good. I ahd not noticed the 5-5 shape.|pg||
nt|mariner1: no slam but very close|pg||
nt|bobh1: most tricks in @hss but since they only give you credit for 13, 7n|pg||
nt|jcmax: This should theoretically not be ifficult to bid. There is a fit and W can just ask for aces and place the contract|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i thought west would bid 4@D over 2NT to give the close suit|pg||
nt|andyv:  but automatic @d lead from W should dash all that|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3@D is often played as forcing, but no here (I guess).|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: although I think declarer is 1 entry short|pg||
nt|hedyg: can they stop after 2@c?|pg||
nt|brolucius: In fact a reverse facing a two-level response is usually forcing to game whatever responder does next (except pass...)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@C is not GF. They do not play 2/1|pg||
nt|xenya: that's what S must be hoping for, Hedy|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Next set in 3 hours. Lunch break after this (board 32)|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 5@C looks a better save|pg||
nt|hedyg: the only way i know to stop is if S bid "stop" 2@c|pg||
nt|brolucius: They have stopped safely, but I am surprised. North had a great hand for a club contract.|pg||
nt|mariner1: and the Shadow knows....... :)|pg||
nt|haans: Franchi did fool them|pg||
nt|cicus: Villa may gain 1 IMP by leading a heart|pg||
mb|5C|nt|ralfwil: after 1@h - D i had prefered 1nt as W, not 1@s|pg||
nt|lestergold: spec has spotted it|pg||
nt|ritong: justto hear part repeat @hs  no, thanks|pg||
nt|lestergold: itsa 20/20 hand|pg||
nt|lml: 4@H is close|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes close but no cigar|pg||
nt|lml: I would be disappointed not to be in it until I discovered the break|pg||
nt|mariner1: since E is limited and so is W should the even be thinking game?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: villa Fabriche might have gained an imp by leading a diamond|pg||
nt|peachy: they might get a very short lunch break|pg||
nt|andyv:  well, i'd be off looking for a slam on this one:)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Indeed.|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: they must have some method of showing stronger hands... perhaps a 2NT type reverse-lebensohl?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Perhaps that is why you are commentating, rather than being 74 IMPs down in this match.|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: i means that KQJ10xx x xx K10xx it is ok for 2@S, but AQJ10xx x xx Q10xx can be dangerous|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, presumably @@'s sequence id the weakest possible|pg||
nt|xenya: *S's|pg||
nt|andyv:  maybe they don't have 1N available?|pg||
nt|brolucius: As little as @CK-Q-x-x-x-x in the South hand might give you a good play for game.|pg||
nt|andyv:  or it was taken out of the bid box?|pg||
mb|6S|nt|sharkey: Need a @D lead to have a chance to set 6 NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: Roland is watching his minions commentate|pg||
nt|lml: well they did well to avoid the game anyway|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@d doesnt|pg||
nt|brolucius: South has followed a strong sequence. I would have bid just 3@H (=a raise to 2@H) on the first round.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The vugraph schedule web page has been updated, so you can get an impression of what's on offer in the weeks to come (broadcasts that we are aware of that is)|pg||
nt|jtr: Yes, it has been rather slow|pg||
nt|cicus: raise on 3 small is dubious if 2@S can be 4 so there may be other inferences|pg||
nt|peachy: 2S can indeed be 4 cards, per sys card|pg||
nt|hedyg: did he? certainly X was penalty|pg||
nt|jcmax: I don't think dbl was penalty, but just showin some values. Parnter is free to bid on with a dsitributional hand.|pg||
nt|haans: W did not know they had real clubs|pg||
nt|jcmax: And that's exactly what Lauria did.|pg||
nt|haans: franchi bid 4@S on balanced hand|pg||
nt|brolucius: West would have opened 1@S with @SA-Q @HA @CA, so slam was very unlikely. Would need three aces and six spades to the ace. But then West would not have opened 1NT.|pg||
mb|7S|nt|sharkey: 4 NT quantative here?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If declarer avoids a diamond lead and she guesses hearts, she is in fine shape. On a diamond lead she is destined to go down|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@H*|pg||
nt|andyv:  N has nothing to cue...will stop at 4@h|pg||
nt|mariner1: S trying for a slam|pg||
nt|roswolf: true|pg||
nt|hedyg: i think they play 1NT= 5 @ss|pg||
nt|hedyg: not real @cs? what else can 3@c mean?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I hate leding doubletons - glad to see it is not working well here :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: this segment takes a wild turn|pg||
nt|daman: Padova prends le devant par trois longeurs     Padova takes the leas my 3 IMPs (lengths)|pg||
nt|daman: lead*|pg||
nt|marlowepi: after the 1H response, 7 should be a foregone conclusion|pg||
nt|bobh1: i think you hav 17 tricks in @hs with reasonable breaks|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: no slaminterest |pg||
nt|bobh1: ho hum|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@S maybe some sort of range?|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@C here was a slam check|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that's enough tricks to make a heart grand on this board and to defeat an opposing heart game on the hext one|pg||
nt|bridge_one: may pair use the rule that after two round od cue 4Nt is cue also|pg||
nt|marlowepi: there should be an escrow account:)|pg||

pc|d4|nt|sharkey: agree|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I guess most did already|pg||
nt|eugenio123: probably it is 4th just with @d support|pg||
nt|cicus: I wonder what X would have been , maybe penalty?|pg||
nt|hedyg: but then he could bid 1@s= 0-4 @ss|pg||
pc|h3|nt|daman: would it be the upset of the year if Angelini lost?|pg||
nt|brolucius: What was the point of South's double? Getting too high is his fault, as I see it (although no doubt Angelini will apologise for it.)|pg||
nt|bobh1: hopefully 4n is some kind of KC inquiry|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe there is a tournament prize for the longest auction|pg||
pc|dT|nt|brolucius: No idea why Nunes doubled instead of bidding 1@S.|pg||
nt|sharkey: @H set as trump here I think|pg||
nt|mariner1: N worried about making game after seeing dummy|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4Nt key cards here, not cue|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|daman: we all know you cannot spell Mike|pg||
nt|lestergold: now its george he spelt onions minions|pg||
nt|hedyg: many Italians play Ghestem in which case @S/@C was known in E, so Versace could bid 3@H or unusual vs unusual with a better hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if so, that 2S bid was awfully wasteful...|pg||
pc|s6|nt|odysseus69: goooing to get trump lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  it would seem logical|pg||
nt|brolucius: What does 2@C show then, Hedy? Do you have their convention-card before you?|pg||
nt|hedyg: well we dont have their system so just guessing|pg||
nt|hedyg: sry, no|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sA|pc|s7|pg||
nt|hedyg: had to keep that 10 @H|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 5H= 2 without Q probably|pg||
nt|sharkey: @D lead|pg||
nt|jcmax: Looking at the final stage of this auction I am quite sure we don't have a clue what anything meant :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: i dont think the squeeze works|pg||
nt|jcmax: It doesn't look to me there will be a squeeze, because declarer only can hold a singleton @S in dummy, so it doesn't help him when N discards a @S honour in the end.|pg||
nt|hedyg: in the 5 card ending there is 1@s and 4 @ds in dummy and N keeps A@s and 4 @ds, S must keep 10@d|pg||
pc|sK|nt|jcmax: If one of the @D honours was in declarer's hand the squeeze would work, because there would be an entry back to his hand|pg||
pc|sT|nt|Walddk2: That would be strong|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Excellent Irene Baroni!|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - offensive vs small slams|pg||
nt|sharkey: Trump lead vs Grand|pg||
nt|odysseus69: good lead- the old rule about attacking against small slams still works (sometimes)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And those who claim that you must never lead away from a king against a slam will get food for thought|pg||
nt|sharkey: If S makes this West should hide her cards more carefully....|pg||
nt|odysseus69: i was doing a doing a disservice to womens bridge by suggesting a trump lead|pg||
nt|cuttysark: This 4@H bid contrasts with getting to 2@H opposite a re-opening: even if South has shown a good hand, he did not start with 2@S|pg||
nt|andyv:  dbl could have been two things...1) able to punish one of their suits and 2) a limit raise in @hs with only 3|pg||
nt|april7: why that way|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes|pg||
pc|s8|nt|lml: hes still okay in 3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: GIB will likely tell you that there is an overtrick, but the thing is that GIB plays with all cards in view|pg||
nt|daman: I would find it difficult to criticize Alfredo|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|daman: wow|pg||
nt|brolucius: Wow, South bid 4@S at the other table. I prefer a double to that.|pg||
nt|lestergold: well its interesting how these chaps no when to avoid bidding their six card spade suits|pg||
nt|brolucius: 1@S (10)         Double (5)         4@S (2)|pg||
nt|ritong: matteucci kindly warned|pg||
nt|haans: now sure :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: now he can relax|pg||
nt|bobh1: feeling better now|pg||
nt|marlowepi: wd. i'd have gotten there in more antedivluvian fashion|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Walddk2: Humans should go down|pg||
nt|sharkey: We'll all make an overtrick from here so not surprised that GIB agrees with us Roland|pg||
nt|odysseus69: might as well play diamond now|pg||
nt|roswolf: really this looks a strange line|pg||
nt|april7: @H now!!!|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lml: and 4 was unlikely anyway on repeated club plays|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes, but could have made 10 tricks|pg||
nt|andyv:  OR apparently doesn't play lebonsohl over reverses.... S simply bid 3@d over 2@s|pg||
nt|hedyg: even if he had 10@d|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|Walddk2: First hurdle is to guess spades. That is not obvious|pg||
nt|Walddk2: hearts rather|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, he could bid 2@S with a sound raise to 3@H and a direct 3@H with a lesser hand (which is what he held).|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|lestergold: yep nunese smelt a misfit anhe read SJ Simon'sold book|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not sure about that|pg||
pc|cK|nt|marlowepi: i think i know what 7H meant|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes Sabine, may be they used any gadgets here :)|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: It's also possible that 1NT they use as a GF relay|pg||
pc|c5|nt|andyv:  it looks like Alfredo was hedging his bets|pg||
nt|brolucius: There are so few opportunities, we should criticise him while we can! |pg||
nt|hedyg: he could bid 2@s to show a limit raise|pg||
nt|hedyg: sry David, i was too slow|pg||
nt|andyv:  if that's what they play|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I think North did too much with a minimum 5-3-3-2 opposite an invitational bid at best|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@s could also show a @s stopper|pg||
nt|andyv:  and invite values|pg||
nt|jtr: Playing this way in case @ss 4-1|pg||
nt|brolucius: Leading doubleton honours is even worse. I am sure you agree, Liz.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|hedyg: spec suggests 2@c= i have nothing|pg||
nt|andyv:  and 2 bids may be limited... could be a treatment|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 4@s on S must be some kind of suicide....|pg||
nt|hedyg: well, he had that as well|pg||
mc|13|nt|Walddk2: I don't think anyone will agree with this line|pg||

nt|jtr: With the opening bid, yes|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I think perhaps only West can make 6@D :)|pg||
nt|april7: generous by Fantoni!!!|pg||
nt|roswolf: i do hope so!|pg||
nt|andyv:  meantime, a push board:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  Roland, close your eyes|pg||
nt|andyv:  S has a F.....y bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: Versace did bid 3@H and is playing 4 @hs|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Leading Ax or Kx scores the ocasional triumph. The others are for the birds (unless partner bid the suit...)|pg||
nt|cicus: time running out for VF, 8 to go, 88 to gain|pg||
nt|brolucius: A 5-4 scoreline after eight hands. Not exactly riveting fare.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: The leaders will not object|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: indeed :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  5@h and 5+ other (not @s)|pg||
nt|brolucius: The big hands at the start of this session represented a false dawn. Disappointing collection since then.|pg||
nt|daman: Angelini closing the gap    the rally is on|pg||
nt|hedyg: @d lead makes no difference if he plays @H immediately, no entry to the N hand for the 3rd @d|pg||
nt|sharkey: Since @C finesse was to be taken anyway and if 3-3 @D loser would go away|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@C is that is natural|pg||
nt|odysseus69: unlucky grand- would be sick to go down|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I might even open 5@C at these colours|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You know that West is very strong when it goess pass pass to you|pg||
nt|hedyg: never bet with Roland, he is always right :(|pg||
nt|daman: he owes me 27 of them|pg||
nt|andyv:  vul too much for E|pg||
nt|bobh1: prob 4@h -1|pg||
nt|andyv:  agree|pg||
nt|mariner1: S can count losers,,,,,,,,, I say no slam :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: no game|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Hedy Grey believes 2S was a nebulous reverse. 2N asked & 3H confirmed a big heart raise|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N EW easy|pg||
nt|sybarra: having been an operator,  sometimes they hide the cards   |pg||
nt|sybarra: so operator has difficulty seeing all the cards sometimes |pg||
nt|april7: finally a push|pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks a limit raise|pg||
nt|hedyg: a funny bid?|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: indeed|pg||
nt|andyv:  Hammon likes it... so must have some value:)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Fortunately North has spared us a possibly awful sight.|pg||
nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: lol|pg||
nt|hedyg: how do you bid this opposite a weak NT?|pg||
nt|andyv:  slowly|pg||
nt|hedyg: smolen gets you too hugh|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: how weak is the question|pg||
nt|hedyg: check the CC Adam :)|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  if 2@c is start of invite sequence, then that's my choice|pg||
mb|2S|nt|cuttysark: Quit while you are ahead - that's the Scottish advice|pg||
nt|ritong: :)|pg||
nt|milton_se: this will be a test of the brakes|pg||
mb|d|nt|lestergold: if the bidding does not die quickly then someone will come to grief here|pg||
nt|ritong: might be bloody|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2NT was borderline, especially facing a passed hand.|pg||
nt|lestergold: thats why roland keeps on dealing 20/20s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@C is too wet|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 4 or 5 depending on your temperament|pg||
nt|sharkey: Think I wud have picked 4@C|pg||
nt|daman: those autographed by Roland are worth much more on eBay|pg||
nt|mariner1: well so much for no game :)|pg||
nt|haans: tell opps nothing some chance|pg||
nt|jtr: South may try something?|pg||
nt|sybarra: fit jump |pg||
nt|april7: no limit raise, gf!|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm each to their own|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4@D a splinter (in Italoy always limited at 11/12 hcp)|pg||
nt|sybarra: splinter/no splinter (fit) |pg||
nt|brolucius: One method is to play 1NT - 2@C - 2@D - 2@H as invitational. |pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: They are currently fetching a Scottish £5 note.|pg||
nt|andyv:  makes the defence a lot easier|pg||
nt|bobh1: ew can make 3@s so 4@h is par contract|pg||
nt|mariner1: Will E save here? Phantom?|pg||
nt|andyv:  can't get to 3@s if you don't bid it:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  he passed 1N...why in the world would he bid now?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: a fantunes passed hand  they open light|pg||
nt|ralfwil: this will be interesting. What do you think about pass on S?|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3h a transfer to spades no doubt|pg||
nt|daman: whack 3@S|pg||
nt|ritong: guess west likes it|pg||
nt|lestergold: what i think is for once fantunes are in serious trouble|pg||
nt|mariner1: I like 2@S with the @c fit|pg||
nt|cicus: a transfer?|pg||
nt|jtr: lolol|pg||
nt|cicus: my best score in 8 boards have been 79-0, but not against Fantunes |pg||
nt|brolucius: 1NT - first application of the brakes.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Perhaps 3@H now.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 2@S was 6 4 I think|pg||
nt|jcmax: NOw this is an auction I understand!|pg||
nt|mariner1: promised 4@H and 6@D|pg||
nt|cuttysark: one way to create swing is a bit of judicious underbidding, but single-figure swings are no use to Villa Fabbriche now|pg||
pc|c5|nt|daman: I'm sure they've been in trouble before|pg||
nt|lestergold: well e/w might be able to get close to 3N but in reality this is likely to cost the great executioners|pg||
nt|lestergold: cos they werent likely to bid 3N on ther combined 20|pg||
nt|brolucius: Do North or East have anything to think about?|pg||
nt|ritong: no|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4H looks like too much work|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6@D would be a fair shot by West now|pg||
nt|odysseus69: wet wet wet- tell all Roland- another of your specialities|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 5D is wet too|pg||
nt|daman: at least|pg||
nt|marlowepi: right on, sister|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes, may be 2@S multiway rever - it is used but may pairs in Italy|pg||
nt|peachy: have mercy on S.. :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: a splinter in any suit?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: no i think @S|pg||
nt|april7: for me game hand!|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i prefere to use hight splinter with void and 3@S generic with a sgl|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1@H 3@s = splinter any sgl|pg||
nt|brolucius: That means you have to transfer with 2@D with the same shape and fewer points.|pg||
nt|cicus: would be too simple|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|brolucius: The only real decision was whether North stuck 2NT. That was a quite possible action on his hand.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Isn't that a band, Victor, or was?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: now 5H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Wet Wet Wet  I mean|pg||
nt|odysseus69: sure- I knew you knew - I was expecting a history with some of their hits|pg||
nt|sharkey: If E bids 5@H West will bid again!|pg||
nt|odysseus69: and how|pg||
nt|sharkey: and she'll bid too much... |pg||
nt|sharkey: So either an underbid or an overbid - can't see them landing in 6 of anything|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@C is transfer to 4@H  Namyats or similar|pg||
nt|mariner1: N has no where to easily go except away|pg||
nt|brolucius: Pass - second application of the brakes.|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ritong: ouah|pg||
nt|ralfwil: ?????|pg||
nt|andyv:  I guess E did|pg||
nt|jtr: Tough situation in 4th for big balanced hands|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: playing a weak NT however it is often quite useful to use 2@h as p/c|pg||
nt|mariner1: no entry to dummy hurts|pg||
nt|cicus: W trying to create a swing|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|c2|nt|lestergold: east not showing too much respect for his partne here|pg||
nt|andyv:  now the work begins|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Victor knows about Wet Wet Wet because the members are Scottish. The band was formed in Clydebank in the early 80's|pg||
nt|andyv:  everyone pass the W hand?|pg||
nt|andyv:  cash two @s and switch to @c|pg||
nt|bobh1: south african |pg||
nt|andyv:  agree, Adam|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: even with 4-4 hands very weak|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok i admit i am lost now|pg||
nt|andyv:  need to bail out more often |pg||
nt|brolucius: But South had a chunky 11 points, so he is entitled to give a full-blooded game try with 2NT on the second round.|pg||
pc|cT|nt|brolucius: I think so.|pg||
nt|jtr: Immediate 1NT is usually 11-14ish|pg||
nt|cicus: yes, I was cruel on him, I know how miserable he is feeling now|pg||
nt|jtr: I am surprised he didnt rebid 2NT but maybe their methods differ|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Some play 11-16 over a major in case partner responds to a double at the 2-level and you have to bid 2NT with 15|pg||
nt|milton_se: nice fertlizer by Nunes|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ritong: lol|pg||
nt|lml: going to make |pg||
nt|hedyg: i think best defense can beat it|pg||
nt|mariner1: another close dbl...... better to pass and hope the confusion causes a set|pg||
nt|lml: he has to play diamonds to make I think|pg||
nt|lml: if they play trump|pg||
nt|andyv:  looks like relay to 3@c and 3@d may show this hand|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: this auction would be fun to interpret|pg||
nt|hedyg: i am trying|pg||
nt|xenya: i can see them reaching 4@H now -- not a bad contract actually|pg||
nt|mariner1: well he could overtake K@D with A@D|pg||
nt|brolucius: South now expects North to have little wasted in diamonds. Unlucky!|pg||
nt|cuttysark: He will also be disappointed to find there are 3 trump losers|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it is well now that sabine and daniela play a completely natural system with no fancy artificialities:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well known|pg||
nt|cicus: yes, the 2@D preempt worked wonderfully|pg||
nt|ralfwil: In my opinion 3@h is enough on S and N will raise to 4@h with a better hand|pg||
pc|h6|nt|lestergold: I cannot see why east has puled this double|pg||
nt|ritong: go and get em fulvio|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes|pg||
nt|bridge_one: normally in Italy the first rever is multiway|pg||
pc|hA|nt|brolucius: Slow as ithe bidding was, East should have thought longer before pulling partner's double. Surely Double and Double had only one meaning?|pg||
nt|lml: I would have ducked the spade though|pg||
nt|sharkey: Actually 7@H is not an overbid - just extremely unlucky it doesn't make|pg||
nt|jtr: I play 11-15 with a range enquiry|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but they could use also a polish style, where 1@H 4@d = i want play 4@h |pg||
nt|cuttysark: Another way to create swings is to make penalty doubles - perhaps South should hae tried a double here|pg||
pc|h2|nt|cuttysark: I am sure some will bid, but I am chicken|pg||
nt|hedyg: especially since i dont know why N did not pass 2NT|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am not generally impressed by those who make a lot of bids. Those who make a lot of tricks... I respect them more.|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: on the @d finesse and a non-@s ruff basically... not great odds|pg||
nt|hedyg: except if they play 10-12 NT|pg||
nt|andyv:  not a ba contract that will fail|pg||
nt|andyv:  bad|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Would not be unreasonable to lead a diamond, and then ....|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: I think 2NT might have been a relay to 3@c, Hedy|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: and 3@d showing 4=5 majors Inv. maybe|pg||
nt|andyv:  it looked like a relay and 3@d showed a smolanish hand|pg||
nt|brolucius: If Culbertson were alive today, he would be saying "I don't see North's two-and-a-half honor tricks. No wonder they got too high!"|pg||
nt|cicus: that was surely penalties for the, and he had to bid hearts sooner or later|pg||
nt|cicus: *them|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|brolucius: And East had brilliant defence against spades himself, a singleton club and two trumps. |pg||
nt|andyv:  but I'm not sure it was GF|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|lestergold: this is all about now whether east can restrict his iamond losers to only one|pg||
nt|ritong: a small @d is coming that s for sure|pg||
nt|lestergold: there are4 black suit tricks available in dummy but communications are very bad |pg||
nt|brolucius: East is lucky that there is any play for game their way. He could not expect West to hold three hearts when he said that he wanted to defend.|pg||
nt|ritong: unless he tries the @c hook to pitch a @s|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Perhaps a @c finess and a @s discard followed by @d10 can make anything|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: minaldo is thinking........ |pg||
nt|ritong: who would not|pg||
nt|lestergold: well a club hook followed by a spade discard sill leaves a lot of diamonds to deal with- he could then afford to lose 2 dimaonds but not three|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, that is why i suggested " a @d now"|pg||
nt|andyv:  David, is that before or after the 800?:)|pg||
nt|brolucius: If you are a chicken, Liz, what does that leave me to be?|pg||
nt|hedyg: what do you want to bid on the 4 level?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|hedyg: now more @hs|pg||
nt|andyv:  and a game finally doesn't make!|pg||
nt|cuttysark: That makes you some person|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Pulga has to find three discards and he won't like that|pg||

nt|lml: tough hand for declarer and defenders.|pg||
nt|mariner1: a lesson in not making close dbl's|pg||
nt|hedyg: or beat it if you do|pg||
nt|mariner1: you only gain 1 imp if beating it one anyway|pg||
nt|andyv:  since they opened 3@s:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: however you lose the natural minor bids|pg||
nt|cuttysark: If you want to bid, you need that convention|pg||
nt|brolucius: Not very valuable.|pg||

nt|brolucius: Is that the hour of madness, where you come from?|pg||

nt|marlowepi: hedy adds that this nebulous reverse was invented by Garozzo, and that he even plays it himself:)|pg||
nt|jtr: Speeding thinks up thank God!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Let's see if Fulvio upgrades this hand to 1@H (14+)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The alternative is 2@H  10-13|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: North actually :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  by N (as someone else also corrected me!)|pg||
nt|hedyg: not so calm|pg||
nt|mariner1: oh the 2@C on 9 is DBL in Open Room|pg||
nt|milton_se: why not? hadn't denied an opening hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: well they are down 36:0 this segment so 1 imp would be nice|pg||
nt|sharkey: Shud E have bid 7@H with 6 trumps only - after pd bid 6@H on her own?|pg||
nt|jtr: Nicely bid next door|pg||
nt|peachy: i think too good for 2H (10-13)|pg||
nt|april7: I think you can't fool opps.always, if you have the right cards, they can't take your tricks away, better to give right informations to peven if Opps know about it|pg||
nt|cicus: why did he not bid 2@D over 1@S?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: from an income to -500|pg||
nt|hedyg: keep 3 NT as option?|pg||
nt|hedyg: no|pg||
nt|brolucius: I booked in for this session because I thought it might be all over by the 6th session. Shows what I know.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: No, 4@D is sensible|pg||
nt|ritong: of course, the danger is part has the right hand for 3 nT to be the last winning game|pg||
nt|brolucius: Absurd to hope for 3NT, as I see it. Much more important to pre-empt.|pg||
nt|andyv:  board 8 will be a push|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Seems they never upgrade|pg||
nt|eugenio123: I dislike 2@h|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Let's ask K&R|pg||
nt|haans: 1@Sx?|pg||
nt|mariner1: 1@S interests S|pg||
nt|jcmax: South's heart is beating igher now. Oh, maybe I can double them later!|pg||
mb|1S|nt|andyv:  question was whether first Dbl asked for pd's 2nd suit and 2nd dbl was penalty or coop since it was in front of @s bidder|pg||
nt|brolucius: Thank goodness the West hand was not dealt in an American event.|pg||
nt|mariner1: at the risk of 5|pg||
nt|lml: I think if he ducks the spade he can make it after three rounds of hearts on the diamond club squeeze|pg||
nt|mariner1: ot more if the dbl gave the line|pg||
nt|mariner1: or|pg||
nt|lml: but he does have to duck the spade|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@H?|pg||
nt|ritong: but all in all, giving an exact picture of your hand asap is certainly the reasonable option|pg||
nt|haans: i think 2 3 imps is nothing|pg||
nt|cicus: I think 15.5|pg||
nt|hedyg: you can count on our specs to correct us :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  Hard for S to stay out of trouble on this one|pg||
nt|andyv:  they are very good at it!|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: EW cold for 4@S|pg||
nt|bobh1: i have a feeling fireworks are about to go off|pg||
nt|bobh1: not on this hand|pg||
nt|jcmax: it is solely designed for use when playing on bbo vugraph, so no commentator has any idea of what we are doing and therefor cannot criticise us|pg||
nt|bridge_one: true, the idea was of Garozzo, for juniores team|pg||
nt|cicus: or so|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@c 9/13 5+@c|pg||
nt|roswolf: interesting auction in the other room to a poor contract|pg||
nt|brolucius: You are moving into my special territory, Andy, getting the declarer wrong. I once got the trump suit wrong too (as 825 kibitzers pointed out).|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: lol|pg||
nt|andyv:  hee hee|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Giubilo's 3@D in the other room showed 5-5, good hand but not game-forcing|pg||
nt|haans: hard to x 2@D|pg||
mb|1N|nt|lml: the defense had its chances after that|pg||
nt|mariner1: can S pass this?|pg||
nt|lml: I couldnt|pg||
nt|lml: even if it was allowed|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 10 tricks in hearts, E-W have a save in 5mi|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Anyone but me who prefers 1@H to double?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 10 tricks in hearts - 9 in minors so potential for small swing - |pg||
nt|sharkey: I'm with you Roland|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, sorry. This is 4th of 5. But could have been over by the 5th session. That's what I should have said.|pg||
nt|andyv:  4@h can go for a ride|pg||
nt|brolucius: Now 4@S by West if South passes.|pg||
nt|hedyg: lightner doubles on the 4 level?|pg||
nt|bobh1: pretty good 1n|pg||
nt|mariner1: E would have a real problem pulling trumps here|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: another 3nt on EW|pg||
nt|peachy: in the given sys, I would have chosen 1H, but I trust Fantoni knows better what they have to do|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 14.70|pg||
nt|cicus: but that using that count an opening bid starts from about 13 points|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 2N shows 5+spades, invitational plus|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.jeffgoldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=AJ+AJ98xx+Kxx+xx|pg||
nt|jtr: and now?|pg||
nt|jcmax: Except that some players believe in the rule: If they dbl you on the 1-lvl.....RUN!!!!!|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes!!!|pg||
mb|2C|nt|mariner1: well he has a ratty 13|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 4@S is not so cold - beaten by 4 rounds of hearts (thank you)|pg||
nt|ritong: !!|pg||
nt|hedyg: no!|pg||
nt|hedyg: well..wow|pg||
nt|mariner1: EW could get to high here maybe|pg||
nt|hedyg: same here, 2@c would show a good hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  even 2/1 bidders would have hard time staying of 3@d|pg||
nt|andyv:  3@s|pg||
nt|hedyg: you dont?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: doubling 2 NT establishes a forcing situation, imho|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes.|pg||
nt|ritong: if west wants his pard to bid his second suit, he simply passes 3@s|pg||
nt|andyv:  agree, but still makes the 2nd dbl questionable|pg||
nt|andyv:  ok, i'll go with that|pg||
nt|brolucius: Look at it this way: how on earth can West take the (huge) penalty against 3@S other than by doubling at every opportunity?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Looks like that there is no doubles for penalty in modern bidding.....|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Im  with the double|pg||
nt|cuttysark: West has taken a vow of silence|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|ritong: caviezel really is pessimistic|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Who needs a diamond stopper|pg||
nt|jtr: A shrug and 3NT:)|pg||
nt|jtr: 4@s looks best actually|pg||
nt|ritong: especially when trumps are @cs|pg||
nt|jcmax: I am not telling. You might use it against me. :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's not obvious to do anything with Giubilo's cards|pg||
nt|milton_se: xx  AKs  Exxxxx xxx -- would you bid?|pg||
nt|brolucius: 4@S is middle-of-the-road action, facing a vulnerable weak two-bid.|pg||
nt|cicus: yes|pg||
mb|3S|nt|mariner1: looks more like 10|pg||
nt|lml: hes vulnerable|pg||
nt|lml: East is hoping hes going to pull to spades|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@s making|pg||
nt|lml: but 3NT not making|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if only they could invent something like that for declarer play:)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now dbl by South was takeout of course|pg||
nt|andyv:  are we sure about pass?|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: an advantage of using Gazilli or playing a strong club-type system is that your Jump shifts now can show a good 5-5 hand but not GF|pg||
nt|Walddk2: yes, it's NF|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  if first dbl is GF, then pass would also be forcing... just depends on agreements|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is not GF. It suggests interest in penalising the opponents. (Like redouble over a double).|pg||
nt|ritong: GF might be atad exaggerated  let s make it " board is ourse, don t let em get away with it"|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes.|pg||
nt|andyv:  OK...next:))|pg||
nt|andyv:  if suits are 5-5 why would you prefer @ds to @ss?|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: i think after 3@H he can guess the @ss|pg||
nt|andyv:  A@s followed by high club|pg||
nt|brolucius: A generous adjective.|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@s is cold and might even get doubled|pg||
nt|jtr: Wow he heard me!|pg||
nt|haans: but who many of us have not? I would|pg||
nt|cuttysark: This was a genuine chance for Villa Fabbriche - how about 3NT?|pg||
nt|brolucius: They must take a diamond ruff now.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: I wonder what the double means|pg||
nt|lml: if anything|pg||
nt|lml: I sometimes play it means dont lead a heart|pg||
nt|sharkey: 5@C good sacrifice|pg||
nt|haans: 3nt winning bridge|pg||
nt|mariner1: guess this always makes with careful play|pg||
nt|bobh1: not sure they can beat this|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: =D|pg||
nt|peachy: impressive\|pg||
nt|haans: you are never happy|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mariner1: don't lead anything except a @H :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  can't beat it |pg||
nt|bobh1: the defense has too much to do|pg||
nt|jtr: Wonders of thought transference|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2NT shows 5+ spades, invitational or better|pg||
nt|bridge_one: North could try a DBL again instead 3@D|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|hedyg: he has an honour in @D|pg||
nt|brolucius: No doubt 3@D promises five diamonds, giving North the option of passing. By passing (rather than bidding 3@S) he makes sure that the auction stays at the three-level.|pg||
nt|andyv:  if N passes with that hand, probably should have passed 1@s:)|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: and as it turns out, 3@d is an excellent contract|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sharkey: i have to leave - enjoyed - ty all|pg||

pc|sQ|pg||
nt|hedyg: he wanted to X 4 @s maybe|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lml: and that is a good meaning on this hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  hard to beat 3N when declarer starts with 8 tricks|pg||
nt|bobh1: if they try to set up a @h or @c trick, that will give declarer his 9th|pg||
nt|andyv:  E will hook @h and claim|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes it has play|pg||
nt|april7: finally a swing for NS|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ralfwil: there is an old expression in sweden 3nt will always be right|pg||
pc|cK|nt|andyv:  D not too creative|pg||
nt|ritong: or very brave  accepting possible double game swing that way is temerity, imho|pg||
nt|jcmax: Yes, it is quite good with maximum point count and a decent 5-card suit. The KJ bare in @S is a minus though.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's different for Sabine anyway, because her 1@S does not promise more than four cards|pg||
nt|haans: and loooooooooooong m|pg||

pc|h4|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mariner1: @D would not have been my pitch holding A@C|pg||
nt|hedyg: he better cover this|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Why not play a small @h from the table and @h9 from the hand?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer false-cards the @D5, from @D7-5-3, in a desperate attempt to stave off the ruff. |pg||
nt|cuttysark: My spies point out that another way to creat a swing is to play in a different game, perhaps slightly anti-percentage|pg||
nt|brolucius: I don't like the idea of responding 3NT at all. There is plenty of chance of a swing in 4@S, as we have just seen.|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Good morning to Thomas Gotard|pg||
nt|tomi2: hi all|pg||
nt|brolucius: West played @C6 and then @C7. If that denied a doubleton (as is normal), then East's 3rd club is hard to understand. |pg||
nt|bobh1: kit woolsey likes to say: bidding 3n is a dirty job but somebody has to do it|pg||
nt|jcmax: Always good not to go down. Especially when vulnerable. Even though +90 isn't much, it still feels good.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: @H lead would beat the contract, but impossible after the auction|pg||
nt|xenya: was safe to duck? |pg||
nt|andyv:  it was safe, I just don't think he did|pg||
nt|brolucius: Good bidding at the other table.|pg||
nt|hedyg: was safer not to duck|pg||
nt|jcmax: Yes, Hedy, that is very good advice. Except when your trump holding looks vulnerable to you getting endplayed. Then it is often a good idea to lead a short suit to try and score ...|pg||
nt|jcmax: ruffs and avoid the trump endplay|pg||
nt|hedyg: right|pg||
nt|brolucius: When you are not immediately down in the red suits, you can play for a swing (in 4@S) by finessing East for @SQ-x-x.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: this is an interesting hand maybe|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: we all gone to same school|pg||
nt|roswolf: and this hand could have its moments too|pg||
nt|xenya: about the same i think :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  3 or 4@h by N?|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 2@s :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: S did not open in OR, harder here|pg||
nt|brolucius: You should perhaps check (with a 2NT enquiry) whether partner has @SK-Q. If so, then 3NT might be possible. |pg||
mb|4C|nt|andyv:  another 4@h hand|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@D showing the balanced 18-19|pg||
nt|andyv:  they haven't been that creative so far, Adam:)|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: I think 4 though... depends on pre-empt style though|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3@C is a good shot.|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@H would be nice now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They will do very well to bid a slam from here|pg||
nt|andyv:  i'd prefer a higher bid with the N hand...3@c gives opps way too much space|pg||
nt|brolucius: It shows heart support and suggests a club lead if East plays some contract. (More usual on a suit headed by A-Q.)|pg||
nt|mariner1: part scores only here|pg||
mb|4S|nt|brolucius: Did he not realise that there was no need to answer to doorbell?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Would anyone overcall 1@S here?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Boderline.|pg||
nt|ritong: very envisageable|pg||
nt|hedyg: i would not, bad suit and too many @ds|pg||
nt|brolucius: In other words, not quite borderline.|pg||
nt|cicus: good start to a club partial|pg||
nt|cicus: would be even better if X wer T/O now|pg||
nt|andyv:  6chp, opps have @s suit and pd has a weak hand... you aren't buying this contract|pg||
nt|hedyg: double is almost never penalty|pg||
nt|andyv:  unless 2@h can contain @ss|pg||
nt|cicus: 1@C 14+ unbal or 15+ bal|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: promise my pard bids 3@s over that and i come in|pg||
nt|mariner1: running scores at http://www.federbridge.it/g2bwrama/ftpout/minirank.html|pg||
nt|hedyg: it shows hcps|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 3N EW any lead if they find it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@C is Precision-ish, 10-15 with 6 clubs, or 5 clubs and a 4c major|pg||
nt|lml: or both|pg||
nt|brolucius: You certainly wouldn't overcall 1@H if your suit was hearts. 1@S does at least take away space.|pg||
nt|hedyg: remember that pd is a passed hand now!|pg||
nt|cicus: it seems it is|pg||
nt|bridge_one: East know West with less of 10 hcp if unbalanced, so can easy pass also with 4@s notvuln|pg||
nt|roswolf: 1@S = conventional?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i am not sure about 1@S|pg||
nt|brolucius: I prefer 3@H to double, even if they are on the same wavelength as to its meaning.|pg||
nt|andyv:  this bidding just makes it easier for E/W to evaluate their hands... Nunes should already know that Fantoni has a stiff @c|pg||
nt|cicus: 1@D shows herts|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  2N invite with 4 ... could be better hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  this could be costly|pg||
nt|bobh1: in this case is better|pg||
nt|roswolf: or just a psyche|pg||
nt|bridge_one: could be also 4cards ....|pg||
nt|cicus: 0-11|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|andyv:  and overbidders delight hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@S is on as it is|pg||
nt|tomi2: both, south and west try to show a constructive raise via 2nt / the cuebid|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i presume 1@s conventional after the auction|pg||
nt|bridge_one: or 6@S weak or less of 4@s|pg||
nt|bridge_one: many use 1@H 1@s 0/4 cards|pg||
nt|brolucius: Too much, surely. |pg||
nt|hedyg: only -4|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: wow... Fantoni will have to take the plunge I think|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Fantoni's hand getting better every time N and S make a bid|pg||
nt|andyv:  and now, the stiff @h is shown to Fantoni|pg||
pc|c9|nt|brolucius: 3@S was a bit risky, but East was short in hearts and felt he had to act. The story may have a happy ending.|pg||
nt|bobh1: even white he should drive to game at imps|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Duplicating the auction in the other room, (apart from the transfer)|pg||
nt|hedyg: forcing pass?|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: pass and pull to 5@s perhaps is what he will do now?|pg||
nt|haans: last time you said that 4@S + 5@C was bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: LOL|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ralfwil: After elimination, E can play @d and anoter to the @dQ|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@d relay|pg||
nt|lml: brb|pg||
nt|mariner1: and no way to beat this as the card lay|pg||
nt|hedyg: no, can just take 4@hs on lead|pg||
nt|april7: thats for minors probably|pg||
nt|bridge_one: and 1@h 1Nt 5@S |pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm nice auction this:)|pg||
nt|mariner1: seems N migth have pushed back here with his distribution|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 4 spades cold- 5H down 2 - but no need to save when they dont bid it|pg||
nt|andyv:  E is border line... but with prime cards... good 3@s bid|pg||
nt|bobh1: there is no % languishing in 3@h at imps|pg||
nt|mariner1: and N will lead which @D?|pg||
nt|andyv:  depends on the range of 2N bid|pg||
nt|haans: game still need 50% nonvul?|pg||
nt|bobh1: at this table they know the match is close|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes|pg||
nt|ralfwil: what else than P from E?|pg||
nt|bobh1: at the other,fantunes probably think they are still behind|pg||
nt|andyv:  true, no reason for him to suspect that they've gained any ground.|pg||
nt|bobh1: as the number of boards dwindles, this mind set could be a factor|pg||
nt|marlowepi: guessing shoes|pg||
nt|jcmax: Now where s could double for the @S lead, declarer will have to guess the @C suit|pg||
nt|april7: a lot of points are involved here, everybody is bidding|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@c after DBL is natural|pg||
nt|roswolf: well south should know what is going on|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i presume Fantoni will bid 3@S now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, as a slam try|pg||
nt|brolucius: N/S had caused plenty of problems and 4@S might well have been passed out. A shame to give them a second chance with 5@H.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|cuttysark: The diamond length is an asset. I bid|pg||
nt|cicus: such is when you are too quick, Liz :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: no :) pass|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I don't like opening 2@S with a 7-card suit anyway...|pg||
mc|11|nt|ritong: question is : whay will nunes play after the trump ace|pg||
nt|haans: but the master never seem deperate |pg||
nt|bobh1: a @c to the K is my favorite play but i don't think is percentage|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, you should certainly start with the jack|pg||
nt|april7: E suspects something, the strongest person here|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Fantoni passed bec the partner passed at 2Nt telling not a good hand |pg||
nt|bridge_one: West know the partner full of high cards in @d after the sequence|pg||
nt|jcmax: not very enterprising action here|pg||
nt|cicus: neither do I|pg||

nt|ritong: when, as our friend ralf underlined, north is known with exactly 2@ds|pg||
nt|mariner1: yet another 3N EW|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@C 15-17 bal, 15+ with clubs or any 22+|pg||
nt|lml: looks pretty good to me|pg||
nt|cuttysark: you should Michaels with good suitw when playing the hand will be advantageous. Strength not important|pg||
nt|ritong: seems that R & i agree|pg||
nt|brolucius: Are you a worried man?|pg||
nt|haans: 3nt no make|pg||
nt|marlowepi: these calculations are affected somewhat by the fact that NS are nonvul and S is a passed hand. in other words, the spades are probably 5-4. if they were 6-3, W would have more ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: options because if N has D ace then dummy is reachable|pg||
nt|cicus: an easy play|pg||
nt|cicus: :)|pg||
nt|jtr: All plays are easy to him:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: another distributional hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  and the lead down to a precarious 66|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  more fun for the specs this way... another point made by spec... If S had K@d, that would have been a 12 count and he would have opened 1N|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Not Michaels when it can only help opponents to know the distribution|pg||
nt|mariner1: can EW make 4@S on the Moysian here?|pg||
nt|sybarra: better for n/s to have some swing hands|pg||
nt|andyv:  OR playing like they have a dinner date|pg||
nt|hedyg: VF up 4 imps this segment|pg||
nt|brolucius: This is a dud hand, but it would be too stressful if every hand was eventful.|pg||
nt|andyv:  not for the specs:)|pg||
nt|brolucius: If you caught a huge fish every time you cast your line, fishing would not be so popular.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: making 3nt on EW is a good score in OR|pg||
nt|brolucius: With such a huge gap in the scores, this set has had the air of a training session - lacking tension. Still, always a pleasure to watch Nunes/Fantoni. |pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: seems like a flattish board though|pg||
nt|mariner1: 1@S by E?|pg||
nt|jcmax: it might be Bob, but I promise you when you play 60 deals every day for two weeks in the end the percentage plays will pay off|pg||
nt|bobh1: especially graifying when the Q drops under the K|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 6@D are ON here |pg||
nt|hedyg: 12-14 NT|pg||
nt|jcmax: Since several kibs asked: Yes, I think it is possible to dbl 2@C with the N cards|pg||
mb|1H|nt|daman: all things considered the padova team is playing OK|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2Nt 4way xfert|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 10-13  5+ diamonds, unbalanced|pg||
nt|jtr: slammish again|pg||
nt|sybarra: it they swing in right direction |pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1@C 2 more cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 1@s no majors|pg||
nt|Walddk2: yes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@H relay, at least invitational|pg||
nt|andyv:  Hedy won't even need to advise the boys on this one|pg||
nt|andyv:  well, maybe now....|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 2@s wouldn't be pretty... I think they can get it for 500 on a tap?|pg||
mb|2C|nt|brolucius: Apart from removing that double, which cost much more than the current deficit.|pg||
nt|daman: they are only playing the best|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1NT = strong NT|pg||
nt|hedyg: can they bid the grand?|pg||
nt|andyv:  Lew Mathe rule:  bid it when it's right|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@D fit in @D|pg||
nt|Walddk2: any shape|pg||
nt|cicus: and it is making again|pg||
nt|april7: could be only 3 imps if S passes 3@C|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@d multi weak i suppose (or multiway with 6@H)|pg||
nt|april7: N could also bid 2@H if 2@D is multi|pg||
nt|bridge_one: if transfert for @h then can be weak or GF (no limit)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: normally|pg||
mb|d|nt|ralfwil: best lead with a 4-card @h|pg||
nt|andyv:  looks that way...definitely consider passing in MP:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: 10@c drops|pg||
mb|4H|nt|brolucius: They play Precision, remember.|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N does look to be where they will land|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: matteucci si è sbagliato cn gli assi e si è scusato subito|pg||
nt|haans: west did pass|pg||
nt|bobh1: i don't think any game makes|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W should love his hand now|pg||
nt|cicus: with he normal @D play|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@c=i prefere to play 3@c that 2@h|pg||
nt|roswolf: similar start to the other room|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: declarer is locked in dummy and cannot overtake the 9@c... assuming Fantoni holds his 7@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: borderline whether to bid one|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|mariner1: 5@D has a shot|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4@D i amn't weak|pg||
nt|daman: if Fabbbriche could manoeuver a couple more gains in this session the deficit would be much more manageable |pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1@c pass 2@D/@H transfert are played from many pairs in Italy|pg||
nt|roswolf: this wont play well but may be better then 3@H|pg||
nt|daman: might be down 1|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes, maximum one down at 3@c|pg||
nt|april7: in OR S was not disciplined|pg||
nt|daman: EW can make a bunch of @Ss|pg||
nt|daman: on a good day?  game|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: yes but a lot of work to do in game|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 1@S=5+@Hs|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Importat to find the spade fit|pg||
nt|haans: do not think they have system for 5m|pg||
nt|andyv:  pressure will really be on EW now and they should know it|pg||
nt|ralfwil: the same contract as 3nt as I see it|pg||
nt|mariner1: on 11 EW Open Room are in the 4@H|pg||
nt|cicus: @SJ a great card,|pg||
nt|cicus: in OR @DQ took a trick , obviously|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2NT  no singleton   3@C  relay   3@D  3262|pg||
nt|bridge_one: West know opps are weak, so he can bid his suit|pg||
nt|brolucius: Surely West cannot think of passing the double when he has J-6-2 in the trump suit. Partner's double is for take-out and he might be 1-4-4-4.|pg||
nt|andyv:  nice analysis|pg||
pc|c6|nt|lml: is this a coffee break type hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: leading for pd with a weak hand, hoping to hit his suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: An excellent example. 4-4 plays better than 6-3. 7@S makes, 7@H does not|pg||
nt|andyv:  S has shown 5+@hs and 4@s so far|pg||
nt|haans: certain they have 11 as loser|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 5@C perfect - no key maximum hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@s not alerted, i am guessing @s + minor|pg||
nt|andyv:  not in imps... way too costly if you are wrong|pg||
pc|cA|nt|bridge_one: solid @D , so 3@D seam correct|pg||
nt|cicus: 3NT making is quite a good result in OR - I can't see a sure way for 9 tricks|pg||
pc|c3|nt|odysseus69: more wet|pg||
nt|ritong: ciao a tutti  had great fun wish you the same|pg||
nt|brolucius: Is it? Hearts seems to play OK.|pg||
nt|haans: they need a break?|pg||
nt|cicus: of course you might guess the @CQ|pg||
nt|cuttysark: North led hearts in the other room, so he finesses clubs into the safe hand|pg||
nt|cuttysark: With the diamond finesse in reserve|pg||
nt|brolucius: With hearts not led, declarer may play on diamonds first. |pg||
nt|brolucius: If the diamond finesse loses and South persists with spades, you can continue diamonds.|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|tomi2: nrth's bidding does not look like 11 hcp with 3 card fit to me|pg||
nt|odysseus69: nor to me|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not in seven, David|pg||
nt|brolucius: Au revoir, Henri!|pg||
nt|jtr: with any 3?|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|hedyg: but cannot make 13 tricks in @H|pg||
nt|hedyg: bye Riton|pg||
nt|andyv:  and 8+ hcp|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I can defeat 7@H - unless I revoke|pg||
nt|andyv:  bye|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, I see. But 7@S is borderline with J-10-x-x-x missing.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: yes|pg||
nt|cicus: any 3 spades :)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mariner1: so SSD takes the lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  Angelini up by 10 now and time running out quickly|pg||
nt|april7: only a 2 imp swing|pg||
mc|12|nt|andyv:  choice of leads here|pg||
nt|mariner1: well can N shift to a @c|pg||
nt|mariner1: @H continuation makes the game|pg||
nt|ralfwil: the best E can do now is playing @h10|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think so. He knows hearts can't be running with 109xx in the dummy|pg||
nt|roswolf: but the right way!|pg||
nt|april7: against Fantoni,is that the right way???|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the best card from dummy|pg||
nt|roswolf: against the leaders|pg||
nt|april7: ok|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Play finished in the closed room. They will get a longer dinner break|pg||
