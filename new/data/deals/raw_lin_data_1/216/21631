mb|p|mb|1S|nt|copeyj: He liked AAK I suppose|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N!|an|f1r|nt|dburn: oh, sure - ace-ace-king is an opening in any position at any vulnerability, but happened not to work well that time|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|copeyj: I think they play transfers over 1M-1N|pg||

nt|copeyj: Maybe 2@C was @D or balanced|pg||
nt|vugraphzvt: 2@s described as doubleton spade or poor hand|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Discussion of flushing kind of obviates any possibility of dry wit...|pg||
pc|s9|nt|copeyj: @S lead will not trouble the scorers I don't think - lose at most 2@H 2@D 1@C|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|d4|pg||
nt|henryb:  David, it depends on who you are. Roth in his heyday would not open three bare aces and 4-3-3-3 shape, or even 5-3-3-2 unless the 5 card had A10 at the top|pg||
nt|dburn: no one knows - attributed to several people, none of whom probably said it first|pg||

mb|2S|nt|oosmanb:  Hi everyone|pg||
mb|p|nt|clinch: Douglas Piper and Alex Wilkinson for Scotland; Peter Crouch and Derek Patterson for England|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|oosmanb:  2@D was multi. 4@C was : Bid one UNDER your major, and then South can declare it|pg||
nt|oosmanb:  Playing 4@C this way, (and 4@D = bid your major) allows responder to protect his holdings|pg||
pc|dA|nt|eamongall: Good evening folks |pg||

pc|s7|nt|vugraphzvu: yes, 4@c would show a stronger hand with @h|pg||

nt|eamongall: and Peter Goodman a regular visitor to Dublin (maybe he lives here) ...but afraid I don't know Pownall in person |pg||

nt|vugraphzvu: according to the system file 3+ @H or 5+H if GF|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hQ|pc|h6|pg||
nt|eamongall: McDonagh  has represented Ireland in the recent past at Senior level with Pat McDevitt ... I think Heneghan is making his debut here for Ireland |pg||
pc|hA|nt|clinch: Some guesses in the red suits here - first was wrong|pg||

pc|s2|nt|clinch: A club from Wilkison would have been interesting, but didn't happen|pg||

nt|clinch: Patterson now can't afford to lose two heart tricks; he will probably exit with a diamond and Piper will be somewhat stuck for an exit card|pg||

nt|santyclz2:  Steve Robinson gave a definition of a constructive raise the other day which I hadn't hear before but which makes a lot of sense:|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|santyclz2:  A constructive raise is a hand that would accept at least 1 game try.|pg||
nt|copeyj: 1@S showing 5+|pg||
nt|copeyj: Wonder what north's poison will be|pg||
nt|copeyj: many pairs play 2@S as natural here, even if he were considering it|pg||

mb|p|pc|c3|pc|cA|pc|c8|pc|c6|pg||

mb|1C!|an|strong, artifical|mb|p|nt|eamongall: of course we can all see @S finesses and endplays with @C but this is teams and over a 32 board match an imp here or there is less crucial then going down in a game |pg||
mb|1D!|an|negative|nt|clinch: Part-score hand now; EW make 3@s; NS 4@d|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: 2D is either 6+ D no 4cM and 10-13 or 5-9 with 4+D and a 5cM|pg||

mb|p|nt|copeyj: Yes Henry|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed - there are enough club spots to set up a second trick there to dispose of a diamond, but...|pg||
nt|copeyj: the @C pips are up to the task|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  (If you guess @cs on a @c lead -- which shouldn't be too difficult.)|pg||
nt|copeyj: Presumably 3@C a 3 card limit raise|pg||
mb|3H|an|concentration of strength|mb|p|nt|copeyj: I confess I might have opened 2N with south in a natural system|pg||
nt|dburn: mind you, with that 4-1 trump break, can you keep control while setting up that club?|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|dburn: I mean, if you take a heart ruff on the table and draw trumps, then East will force your last trump with a heart when he wins the second club|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  20.80 http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=akj93+ak7+1054+a8|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  play for 6@s|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if you avoid a @h loser, just the @cA to lose|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: bidding is pointing towards a heart lead   so better stop in game|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: I think 1C was conventional|pg||
nt|ady: ok   so 1@C had not promised clubs|pg||
nt|timb: The splinter should slow things down!|pg||
nt|timb: 1@C usually balanced or clubs|pg||

mb|2N|an|!d|nt|eamongall: good choice by Peter Goodman to remain quiet as Heneghan surely would have got noisy over @Hs |pg||

nt|vugraphzvu: dont think delberto will take too long with this one|pg||
mb|3S|an|3!s and values|nt|vugraphzvu: with the K@S lead|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  North is about to find out that South's second suit is spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  and this sequence has protected the @dAQ|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  North is sure to look for a slam once he finds out South's second suit is spades rather than clubs|pg||
mb|4H|nt|clinch: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  maybe I should have said 'if' rather than 'once' :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: not clear if 3@s is systemically 3+@s or exactly 3...|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if North uses RKCB with @h inferentially agreed, the response will reveal 2 key cards missing|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: I *think* 3@s has shown exactly 3@s as N bid 2N, not 2@s|pg||
mb|4S|an|Kickback|nt|ady: must assume 4NT in this sequence not rkc|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: 4N was asking something...impossible to read the Robson scrawl|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  South may be trying to work out whether 4@s is a cue with @h agreed or an attempt to play there|pg||
mb|4N|an|1 or 4 key cards|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  it seems 4@s was a keycard ask, so 4NT = 1 or 4|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: Crouch did write he *thought* 4@s is RKCB, so we may be in the unknown here|pg||
mb|5H|nt|ady: not suprising with Robson having 2 small of a suit not bid or cu bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  using the bid at the 4 level one denomination above the trump suit is kickback|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: though he has confirmed N should not have 4@s on the bidding|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  so 4@s is the ask with @h agreed, 4@h with @d agreed etc|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  play will be quick here|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  on 2 England gained 2 IMPs|pg||
pc|s5|nt|timb: This should be quick - a DT&C deal (Draw Trumps and Claim)|pg||

mb|p|nt|clinch: On the other hand they did bid the 4@s missed by Scotland earlier|pg||

pc|h7|pc|h2|pc|hK|pg||
nt|timb: I'm getting old because I'm not a fan |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  South might not make a try even facing 15-17 with his 4333 shape|pg||
nt|ady: the Crouch 1 spade bid in this room put paid to that|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: 1N may have 5cM or 6cm|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|nt|timb: of that negative double by North; Ugggggggggggggggggh|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|clinch: 4@d is the limit here, and will quickly be made|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|ady: north a little busy there  with a hand that may not respond to an opening|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sT|pc|sA|nt|ady: Robson a little unfortunate to find so much in hearts opposite   and diamond finesse wrong|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|ady: that apart  the spades are far from solis    might often lose 2 tricks|pg||
nt|ady: solid|pg||

pc|c7|pc|c4|nt|emre kaya: 150 yaparsa EW e iyi yapamazsa Ns a|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|timb: I think East would always make a strong raise in spades (2NT) and most would then bid 4@S with the West cards without bidding 3@D (following the great SJ Simon's advice of bashing ...|pg||
nt|timb: games)|pg||
nt|ady: yes    action was reasonable|pg||
nt|timb: Now Andrew R has to guess the trumps for down one|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: Robson asking S if they play 15-17 NT...and about lead styles|pg||
nt|ady: Q@S  instead of KQ@H   and 4 spades is on diamond finesse through the opening bid|pg||

nt|santyclz2:  Good morning.  Welcome from the beautiful Poconos where the ski areas are rueing the beautiful weather.|pg||
nt|copeyj: E/W 14-16 NT, 5cM, nebulous @C and 1@D is unbalanced|pg||
mb|2H|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Joe Shair|pg||
nt|copeyj: 2@H is constructive weak 2|pg||
nt|dburn: there is not much skiing around Hyde Park, but the weather is not atrocious|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: 4@S on for N/S|pg||
nt|copeyj: E/W have 9 tricks in @H I think|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|copeyj: 2NT perhaps semi psychic from Forrester|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D!|an|feature|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|dburn: Forrester attempting a diversion in an effort to convince North-South he has something|pg||
nt|copeyj: 3@D naturalish|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cA|nt|dburn: North-South duly convinced, although that really was a bit feeble by Goodman|pg||
nt|copeyj: It has worked, and now @S switch needed to avoid it making|pg||

nt|santyclz2:   6/4 distribution with aces both suits is a powerful hand.|pg||
pc|c3|pc|d5|nt|dburn: if the bidding had been 2@h-pass-4@h, North would have bid 4@s - as it was, he could have bid 3@s and left it to partner, so to pass was...|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cK|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  for the final 3 boards we have a comparison|pg||
nt|ady: good result for England   4@H -1 in OR|pg||
mb|2H!|an|weak|nt|yorkbeach:  4@s looks good for NS|pg||
mb|d|nt|emre kaya: e biraz|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S appears to make|pg||
mb|4H|nt|clinch: Looks as though 3@s might have made, so good judgment all round|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: so 1@d here is limited and denies a 4cM, may not necessarily have @d|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  NS did not get in the bidding in the other room|pg||
mb|4S|nt|clinch: We have comparisons for the last three boards, and 4@h one down looks likely to be duplicated here|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: solid 6@H here    diamond finesse for 13 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: 2@d here confirming a @d suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|timb: I like to play that the double of 2-level artificial pre-empts promises 15+p|pg||
nt|clinch: Will need to avoid a @c lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: looks like 15/16 both strong results for eng though|pg||
mb|p|nt|timb: It's not optimal for every situation but it seems reduces our sides guesses|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: nice bid by Derek there|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cA|nt|nurkumkale: :)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|VUGRAPHZVH: sry|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
nt|clinch: Having looked at it, It may be possible to make 4@h if the diamond position is judged|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ady: oops    swing for England|pg||
nt|ady: many imps on K@D|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s5|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|ady: South not pleased with the lead|pg||
nt|frederic:  and now even less :)|pg||
nt|timb: Surely 5@H, asking for a spade control would be better the we'd have 5@S (1st), 6@C, 6@H (no @C control) is better than a RKCB guess|pg||
nt|ady: 14 imps for england|pg||
nt|ady: same opening   but south passed in OR    11 HCP  including Q@H   not unreasonable|pg||

mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  If Eddie describes something as 'nice' it means obvious|pg||
mb|p|nt|clinch: So here Scotland got optimistic|pg||
nt|clinch: Not unreasonably|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: it had some play. lets see how N/S bid it|pg||
nt|clinch: Will surely start with some kind of forcing spade raise|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: on a club lead do you need spades 1-1 (or an inspired hook) H 3-3 and the Q@H onside... not too much|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: double partscore there making up for some of it|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C!|an|strong, art|nt|ady: if diamond finesse right 11 imps the other way   25 imps swing|pg||
nt|ady: north might have entered in CR   even so on last hand|pg||
mb|1S|nt|clinch: Don't think hearts need to be 3-3 if trumps are picked up, but they do if not!|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: ah yes, sorry. so its not the worst slam then|pg||

nt|vugraphzvu: non-vul they play wonderbids|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ady: double?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|yorkbeach:  at this vulnerability tough for NS to bid 4@s|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ady: would lose 500|pg||
mb|d|nt|clinch: Patterson hasn't quite got his hand across yet!|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: i guess this will keep them out of slam though|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  we have seen a few successful sacrifices at adverse vulnerability|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  needs to get defenders to break (or return) a @h|pg||
nt|ady: this may cost as 3NT  with bad club split  going down|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  do not what Shields is thionking about at this vulnerability|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  well judged :)|pg||
nt|ady: A@S lead as good as any|pg||

nt|emre kaya: doðu jülide yardýmcý|pg||
nt|eamongall: We note the debutant Heneghan hogging the bidding with his 3 card suit |pg||
nt|eamongall: I played a match with Heneghan as Team mate one time and spent the week wondering how he blew a trick in 4@Hs ... they were 6@Hs-1 against me ... |pg||
nt|copeyj: game down on @C lead though and cant imagine wilkinson leading anything else|pg||
nt|clinch: Yes, and 5@s is a very unlucky contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: fingering a heart.....|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: now the Q@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: asking lots of questions and thinking still|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: crouch says he cant have a shortage, and with that he settles on K@C|pg||
pc|sT|nt|nurkumkale: teþekkürler|pg||
nt|clinch: Nervy times for Scottish viewers - can open eyes now|pg||
nt|clinch: So will be 3 IMPs to England nonetheless|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|pg||
nt|eamongall: including 4 trump tricks despite missing trump ace ... opponents were gone to bar on that hand |pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: oooh, 3@h E here|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  north and East are on the same side of the screen|pg||
pc|c3|nt|eamongall: Turned out Heneghan had declared 4@S on a 3-1 fit making 10 |pg||
pc|c8|pc|cA|pc|s7|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  so in theory it could have been North who was thinking|pg||
nt|ady: just keep away from hearts  and 500 in the bag|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if declarer can strip the minors before playing a @h to the 9, that will endplay East|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  but if he ruffs 2@d in dummy, a ruff and discard will no longer be an option|pg||
nt|ady: may go go for 800  as no quick entry to play a diamond towards the king|pg||
pc|hA|nt|vugraphzvu: guess he will play A@H, AK diamond and exit a club?|pg||
nt|vugraphzvu: on a good day Q@C with E|pg||
pc|h3|nt|eamongall: this hand will take a while ... wondr how long before McDonagh realises Heneghan Hogged his hand |pg||

nt|vugraphzvu: director pacing...time trouble|pg||
nt|ady: could be some problems in 4 spades  with heart leads  and a tap   and spades 4-1|pg||
nt|clinch: I think most clubs would see a lot of 510s on the traveller for this one|pg||
