nt|hedyg: hey Yuval :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Hedy Grey, Vladimir Ivanov and Yuval Yener|pg||
nt|xenya: Hello Yuval|pg||
nt|hedyg: and to Roland :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|yuval10: this is a rematch of the last round of last year's European Open Championship|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|yuval10: Israel has won that match, but Italy has won the Gold medal nontheless|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c3|pc|c2|pc|cT|pc|cA|pg||
nt|yuval10: i don't agree with 3@h holding a singel @s and really an un-impressive hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: he has an ace and a king...that is not just 7 hcps|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c5|pc|cK|nt|xenya: what is the best line here?|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c7|pc|h3|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|yuval10: still not close, and he can't be sure his K@c is working either|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hQ|pc|h2|pc|h6|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h4|pc|hA|pc|h8|pg||
pc|c6|pc|d3|pc|dT|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d2|pc|dA|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok lets discuss the lead...|pg||
nt|yuval10: nice Q@h from South , he can see the 9 tricks of declarer. For no avail this time|pg||
pc|d6|mc|9|pg||
qx|c17|st||md|3SAT7HQJ4DKJ87CQ53,S8HA952D542CK8642,SK952H86DA963CJT7,SQJ643HKT73DQTCA9|sv|o|nt|othered1: well if south bids only 3@H on this hand, north might raise on that excellent 11|pg||
nt|bvdahl: I think I agree that 4@h is probably best in the long run...|pg||
nt|iceking: yes and you usually make overtrick so given that 3@H has to be underbid|pg||
nt|jillan:  Will he upgrade this to 8 points|pg||
nt|jcwla: Was dead to rights on beating 4@C but 4@D not so much, whatevah...|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and we have 2 more boards of today's schedule|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  5@d against 5@h?|pg||
nt|garnetts: tight match |pg||
nt|stewball: this is another example of the inefficiency of a 2nt opening..I've always thought that its the hardest opener to deal with in standard|pg||
nt|jcwla: Has S fully shown this hand?  Or did it take some mention of @D by N for S to know just how great it was?|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: maximim weak pass by north|pg||
nt|jcwla: I guess if 8-card suits are almost always trump then 9-card suits must always be trump.|pg||
nt|bobholl: this should be no problem ...|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sfoxa:  2 next boards, we'll compare the scores, but please disregards the results - it's pair event with IMPs scoring across the field|pg||
nt|rmb1: Roland would be proud of 6@D here|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|sharkey: The @DQ the key here|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  this time, NS have all the power, but may overboard well|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  in @s game, NS have to guess @d right|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  next door, Lauria-Versace bid 3NT and made 11 tricks after @s lead from E|pg||
mb|2H|nt|sfoxa:  yes, they are 26-34 as for now |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  http://www.bridgemoscow.ru/tournaments/results/slava11/slava11t16r7.htm|pg||
nt|hedyg: no puppet here|pg||
mb|p|nt|kjadams: declarer should win the race to 7 tricks here.|pg||
nt|stewball: Lauria chose 1@h in the OR--I;m with him|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|jillan:  the 2@S opening bid shows 0-7 and 5+@S is this to strong|pg||
nt|ybob: Q@D and @C finesse to 8 tricks, M lead was down|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  unexpected end of auction|pg||
nt|hedyg: this might keep them out of slam?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  NS have to be sure they have no 2 losers in @s now|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: this is makeable looking at all hands|pg||
nt|rmb1: I guess 2NT is the other room was natural, many would play it as artificial: scramble (or lebensohl)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  W was really lucky to find @cK in partner's very few points|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: 2@C some Gazzili type bid|pg||
nt|garnetts: hmmm  They both did well to keep low |pg||
pc|d8|nt|sfoxa:  W was on th right track|pg||
nt|hedyg: N has no @s stopper and S doesnt like his K@S anymore|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sfoxa:  same start. |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  W's @s holding is not bold enough, IMHO, to convert passed partner's dbl into penalty|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  S would hardly make the contract, but @d game by EW is missed|pg||
nt|hedyg: so lets try to play in @c.......|pg||
pc|dA|nt|jcwla: Identical auction.|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|d3|nt|bobholl: you have to be very sure that 4@C isn't a cue |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|sfoxa:  7th trick had been stolen|pg||
pc|dK|nt|sharkey: Lauria misguessed @DQ OR|pg||
nt|sharkey: The old adage of the Q behind the J......|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  bad news|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|sfoxa:  so the result|pg||
nt|hedyg: pass over 3@s X denied stopper|pg||
nt|kjadams: The Imp comparisons you see in Movie show vs the Open room, but this is an IMP Pairs competition scored across 8 tables.|pg||
pc|d5|nt|bessi2: indeed Sælensminde lead a @h vs 2N but followed low when Lauria played towards the Q of @d|pg||
nt|rmb1: At some stage West will have to play another @H to get his ruff|pg||
pc|d6|nt|sfoxa:  as for now, tha matter of course follows the same way as next door|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  trump return?|pg||
nt|sharkey: West has a chance to go wrong - dont know pd has @SK...|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  both red suits don't look promising for lead |pg||
nt|sharkey: agree|pg||
nt|sharkey: EW dont have a good round so far...|pg||
nt|bobholl: will put J|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  may be, only 4@h from S show negative and 4@c - cue with some values in @s, whereas rdbl - 1st class comtril in @s|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  *control, sorry|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@s was a slam invite in @H|pg||
nt|hedyg: would probably not bid 4@c without at least the K@S or a singleton|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|hedyg: since N denied control|pg||
pc|c9|nt|sfoxa:  in OR, W got @h A and cashed @d K to receive a signal from partner. E must have been discouraged @d and W hoped to beat contract with @s continuation|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sfoxa:  now, for instance|pg||
nt|rmb1: Getting urgent :)|pg||
pc|cK|nt|othered1: east, of course, wasn't looking at 52 cards|pg||
nt|sharkey: Looking at dummy's @D suit a @D return wudnt be likely anyway|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  exactly. now it's up to N|pg||
pc|s8|nt|sfoxa:  same position appears here|pg||
nt|toobad: We shall try again|pg||
pc|s2|nt|iceking: he had to do something, his line seems fine to me |pg||
nt|iceking: didnt really have any suit to go for, no spot cards anywere|pg||
nt|othered1: agree|pg||
nt|iceking: Not clear for north what is best now|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  simple matter of guessing correctly|pg||
nt|sharkey: All going their way will probably finesse the "right" way|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  in the  7, EW made 3nt after !Q lead|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  next door|pg||
nt|garnetts: 2@C in both rooms was a sort of relay (Gazzilli) and 2@S showed less then 8 points |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  right moment to let contract making|pg||
nt|rmb1: Last chance|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  W hardly expect partner to have 6-card suit|pg||
nt|mareczek: I think that the problem was: after redouble with better hand (maximum of negative 0-8) bid immediately, or pass, and bid in the next round|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sfoxa:  thoug, I wouldn't blame N for one more move  |pg||
nt|kjadams: now we just have declarer playing safe.|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  what about on more @d now?|pg||
nt|kjadams: though 3rd diamond might embarrass south hand!|pg||
pc|d7|pc|c2|pc|d9|pc|h7|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s7|nt|sfoxa:  practical approach - each imp counts|pg||
pc|h2|pc|s5|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cT|pc|cA|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sA|pc|h5|pc|s9|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cJ|nt|sfoxa:  but this result looks like average  - NS can hardly stop in 5@d|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  last board of this round and next one round coming soon. |pg||
nt|mareczek: jump to 3@d should show probably 6+@d|pg||
nt|jcwla: No trump lead makes it likelier that S has something like Q-third.  If decl had the J and didn't get trump lead would probably put S on it.|pg||
pc|hK|pc|c5|pg||
nt|kjadams: have to play the 3rd diamond before the club to force a heart pitch.|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|othered1: @H10 earlier would have worked better|pg||
nt|jcwla: Maybe in a perfect world but those look close enough to 6 for me.|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C|nt|yuval10: seem like 4@h is making here when everything behave|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|hedyg: 2@c didnt promise majors|pg||

nt|othered1: No argument, just an observation|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hi Anita|pg||
nt|iceking: yes i know it look silly but it really wasnt i think|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  ok, applause and several imps to Brink|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  so, last board of the round|pg||
nt|jcwla: BTW it didn't come into play on this hand but if S gets to open this hand and it's in range for 1NT that is my choice.  You often hear "no need to bid 1NT when have a convenient @S ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: rebid" but so often it is not the case, you end up not able to show the hand.|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  present in return for board  27|pg||
nt|hedyg: with A or void XX|pg||
nt|hedyg: last board now of this match|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  last board of the round. scores to be found here in a while http://www.bridgemoscow.ru/tournaments/results/slava11/slava11t16r.htm|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|sfoxa:  last board of this round|pg||
nt|bessi2: looks like 4@s should make easily enough as the cards lie so a good result for Brogeland-Sælensminda in the open room|pg||
nt|hedyg: thank you Yvan, great job :)|pg||
mb|2N|mb|3H!|nt|sfoxa:  thanks to all the  specs for watching and providing with hints, great thanks to our operator, job well done!|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  N may well dream about @d small slam if partner has the right values|pg||
nt|rmb1: I guess NS will reach 3NT (eventually) and make +3|pg||
nt|bobholl: 6@C very fine contract but diffcult to reach after multi|pg||
nt|hedyg: we will be back in ca 25 minutes|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@s by N...|pg||
nt|hedyg: and 4@c by S?|pg||
nt|bobholl: may be :)|pg||
nt|mareczek: multi 2@d weak two in a major|pg||
mb|3N|nt|sharkey: Big round for NS and Lauria-Versace struggling next door|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  next door, NS managed to win 6@c after @h lead |pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: 1@C simular to magic @D|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  with such a superfit, EW have a lot of aces to concede |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  if RDBL shows @d honour, NS here wouldn't  have their life as easy|pg||
nt|hedyg: 6@s is on too |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  is 6@s worse?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: 6@S protects the K@H but is on a guess in @D plus @s finesse|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@s is too final imo|pg||
nt|hedyg: or does it just mean no fit in @d?|pg||
nt|hedyg: anyhow Bessis has a great hand now|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3@S surely F so gives up on slam|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  Does S hand deserves one more bid after "final" 4@s ?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and one more round of today's schedule is coming soon, after short break|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  S hoped for his own play when bidding 1@s, not 2 |pg||
nt|vugraphzyv: thx everyone )|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  next round follows right now, so stay tuned|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  currently, NS are providing 40-20 and keep the lead|pg||
nt|garnetts: strikes me that 4@D now would sort this |pg||
nt|hedyg: surely yes, it is a great hand after the 4@s bid|pg||
nt|mareczek: dbl of 3@h, what do you think should be?|pg||
nt|kjadams: 2N natural and 3H pass or correct.   3N preempts East from showing suit.|pg||
nt|mareczek: hearts or points?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|iceking: even the same |pg||
nt|stewball: Drijver judged to pass 2@c in OR|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sfoxa:  when EW will find sacrifice (very cheap this time), N would better assess his values and score small plus in 4@s dbld|pg||
nt|hedyg: they make it look so easy :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: another fast arrival bid by Volcker|pg||
nt|bobholl: @D 32 is enough so no @D guess|pg||
nt|bobholl: or just trump 2@H |pg||
nt|hedyg: clearly N refused to cuebid anything else so Bessis should pass|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  not easy contract at all. especially after @c lead threatening with ruff|pg||
nt|hedyg: they are not scared|pg||
nt|bobholl: may be N should have tried a "natural" 6@C says spec but that isn't natural i fear |pg||
nt|hedyg: and surely would show 1st rd control in @c|pg||
nt|bobholl: true and with the single @D not attractive|pg||
pc|h8|nt|jcwla: Variations on a theme here.|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  hm, not so S. definitely, no expecting partner with such @s values|pg||
nt|rmb1: Hi|pg||
nt|garnetts: Just been told that is Brink's birthday |pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|mareczek: I think that 2@s solved all problems of N|pg||
nt|mareczek: his problem now is 6 or 7?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  Ns hand deserves one more move|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  S can have at all valueless hand, kind of xxxx QJx xxx xxx - but only this case is really bad for N|pg||
nt|mareczek: I think that rdbl was "bid your suit" and 2@s promises some values in this case|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  3@c must have been very precise with its meaning|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  kind of "maximal hand, both majors. @c values"|pg||
nt|rmb1: This is the last board of the round, thanks to all involved in bringing us this event including my fellow commentator Sveta|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  so N denies his dream|pg||
nt|hedyg: 5@H = fit in @s and 1st rd ctrl in @H|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ybob: 5@H defeat 500 with @D leads from S ( played by E) , hard to do|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  will N find @h lead?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  thanks to our operator Ivan - half a job well done!|pg||
pc|s4|nt|sfoxa:  the only chance for defence|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  hello Robin, welcome to the last board of the round|pg||
nt|garnetts: They did not get a Diamond lead against 6@C next door |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  we'll have 3 more rounds after lunch break|pg||
pc|s9|nt|jcwla: No way, this is cheap insurance time, nobody knows who is making what and they're not going to voluntarily allow a possible double swing.|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  careful now! E has to play @c, not @d  in return|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  next one is coming soon|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|sfoxa:   let's add spices to this game! - Zaleski|pg||
nt|kjadams: double of 3H works when partner has 4H, but otherwise it just lets west in on the hand.|pg||
nt|mareczek: no nie|pg||
nt|mareczek: sorry, priv|pg||
nt|jcwla: Whatever you've agreed.  If haven't agreed, natural for now and we make the agreement after the hand.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|jillan:  maybe S should have ducked that|pg||
nt|bessi2: interesting defence here|pg||
pc|c2|nt|rmb1: Next round at 14:30 CET (13:30 GMT) in 1 hour 40|pg||
pc|c7|nt|rmb1: Sorry.  I thought we had started the next round early :(|pg||
nt|garnetts: Nor here either |pg||
nt|mareczek: unlucky choice of Zmudzinski|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|bessi2: he must play a spade from dummy now if he want to avoid a guess|pg||
nt|jcwla: This is the last board of this segment.  Thanks to Roland, Ivan, John and Marek, and all kibs. |pg||
pc|cJ|nt|mareczek: thanks a lot, bye :)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  good partner finds correct lead, very good one - finds one more trick in the suit |pg||
pc|c4|nt|sfoxa:  idea about cashing @c ace seems better - if partner discourages, E has possibility to switch to @d|pg||
pc|c8|nt|iceking: yes looks clear duck trick one |pg||
nt|jillan:  gives W entries to play @C from dummy|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|bessi2: and now another diamond and declarer must guess|pg||
nt|ybob: was better play K@D and @S to hand|pg||
nt|bessi2: well.. east must not ponder too long though|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  but N has to establish his @h trick or attack the @ds|pg||
nt|mareczek: but it is hard to imagine that opponents can have only 3 cards in one of majors|pg||
pc|c9|nt|bobholl: now he has a @D guess :(|pg||
nt|hedyg: what for? LOL|pg||
nt|sarkar_suk: :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: sry K of @H is grown :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty Sveta and Bob :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: see you all in 15 minutes|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  ty Hedy, see you soon|pg||
nt|bobholl: tya cu later|pg||
pc|c6|nt|sfoxa:  current standing to be found here http://www.bridgemoscow.ru/tournaments/results/slava11/slava11t16r8.htm|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  cashing 2 more @s grants declarer with the contract|pg||
pc|cA|nt|iceking: will just use it to play @C to Ten i assume|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|rmb1: spec says 3@C = max with both majors (2NT = min with both)|pg||
nt|mareczek: so the heart was sensible option|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|pc|dA|nt|jillan:  now I see why....'|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  even this ruff doesn't prevent declarer from making|pg||
nt|sharkey: no - a push|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|kjadams: down 1.|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|vugraphzyv: we will start next round in 1 hour 22 minutes|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  see you. thanks to all|pg||
nt|kjadams: passing 2C was the winner on this hand.|pg||
pc|cT|nt|sharkey: This is the last board of this round - 14 more rounds to follow.  We'll be back soon|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  should admit, you joined the most interesting board of the round :)|pg||
pc|sT|nt|othered1: looks like the normal play|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|jillan:  normal result|pg||
nt|othered1: south m ade two odd plays there|pg||
nt|jillan:  10 or eleven tricks|pg||
nt|rmb1: Lots more bridge on BBO today|pg||
nt|kjadams: 4H would likely make by north south, so not really a loss for Multi.|pg||
nt|mareczek: N nie musia³e mieæ czterech pików, adam mia³ ich sporo|pg||
nt|mareczek: sorry again|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h5|nt|sfoxa:  NS lost a bunch of imps, but can find consolation in retaining pair's moral. Leading partner's suit. |pg||

nt|jcwla: Strange stuff here.  |pg||
pc|h6|nt|jcwla: Anyway, thanks Sveta and Ivan and all kibs.  For now, from Los Angeles, so long.|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  from both side, I'd say |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  thank you Jordan|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  thanks to all the specs and special "bravo" to our operator - one should try this jib once to understand :)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  see you tomorrow|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  *job, sorry|pg||
mc|10|nt|vugraphzyv: thx everyone)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  ty, Ivan!|pg||
nt|garnetts: thanks all   ttfn been interesting |pg||
nt|rmb1: The open room auction was more constrained, having to start at 3@D|pg||
nt|jcwla: For now, from Los Angeles, so long.|pg||
nt|kjadams: This is such an outstanding event.   The organizers must be thanked for bringing this quality field together.|pg||
nt|kjadams: kib asks.. what is Slava cup|pg||
nt|mareczek: thanks all|pg||

mb|1H|nt|vugraphzyv: hello|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  re-hi|pg||
nt|vugraphzyv: Hello|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  Polish experience vs. Dutch drive|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  EW may well land in 3NT having 25 points, but the mission of collecting 9 tricks may be impossible |pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: 20-20 hand.  W has no call over 1@S.|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  EW can hardly win the bidding, although... |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  let' see|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  Hello to all - round 6 of Slava Cup is about to start|pg||
nt|jcwla: Nothing like a slam to start things off.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Marek Wójcicki|pg||
nt|mareczek: hi all :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hi Marek, Roland, John, Ivan.|pg||
mb|4N|nt|sfoxa:  N showed @h and @c two-suiter and E seems to be happy to dbl|pg||
mb|p|nt|mareczek: Gromow Dubinin play strong club, Precision style|pg||
mb|5C!|nt|iceking: dont think S should upgrade his hand |pg||
nt|mareczek: Herbst brother play natural system with transfer responses after 1@c opening|pg||
nt|bobholl: could be 3NT NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: south upgrades to 12, OK with 2.5 honor tricks, I guess|pg||
mb|5D!|nt|iceking: make little sense to me|pg||
nt|sharkey: 3 NT a challenge - 4@S better|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  anyway, not a coffee-board for a start|pg||
nt|sharkey: nope - East may have overbid slightly - a little to good for 3@S over 3@H.  Needs to take @H finesse I think|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  definitely|pg||
nt|sharkey: West looking at @SQ and @HA....|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  his 10th trick|pg||
nt|mareczek: Herbst brothers, sorry|pg||
nt|mareczek: they both use the same system :)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  current standing is here http://www.bridgemoscow.ru/tournaments/results/slava11/slava11t16r.htm |pg||
nt|rmb1: Only nine tricks in spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: 5-3-3-2 shape bad suit cant see the reason|pg||
nt|jillan:  with a system as this I agree with Magnus|pg||
nt|jcwla: A false preference to 2@S would be better, perhaps those @H's looked like six to N.|pg||
mb|5H!|nt|sfoxa:  welcome to the 3rd round of Slava Cup http://www.slavacup.com/tournament.htm|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and current standing of Top-16 http://www.bridgemoscow.ru/tournaments/results/slava11/slava11t16r.htm|pg||
nt|kjadams: this missing heart Q will stop this at 6.|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: well judged|pg||
nt|jillan:  would need at least another 10 LOL|pg||
nt|othered1: I guess 1N was just generic point-showing, so south had to bid|pg||
nt|iceking: assume now S has shown 12-13hcp with 5@S |pg||
nt|mareczek: Dubinin assumed that partner does not have @dxxx|pg||
mb|5N!|nt|iceking: N took a very good view stop now, i would be little bid interested in 3nt looking at his hand|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  getting fit, W will bid game|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  EW did their best to win the bidding|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  agree. but even now, N can manage his tricks|pg||
nt|garnetts: 3@S is clearly showing a spade shortage |pg||
mb|6C!|nt|sfoxa:  at the tournament web-site, one can find the participants lists (quite impressive) and results for both groups - Top-16 and Top-40|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  Brink-Driver won round 1 and are still doing well|pg||
nt|jcwla: Not even a false preference in this case.|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  tournament is being played in 2 groups - Top 16 includes mostly international stars (Lauria-Versace, ex.)|pg||
nt|garnetts: Something of an overbid in my view|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and Top-40 - mainly Russian players, but with invited guests as well|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: difficult decision now but anything is good|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Good afternoon to Hedy Grey|pg||
nt|hedyg: hello :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: hi Bob :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: and hello to Yvan , our operator |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  looks like organizers intended to provide each nation with BBO-starring opportunity here, whereas Open room is occupied by Lauria-Versace |pg||

nt|hedyg: pls dont send our specs to the OR :(|pg||

nt|hedyg: 4 very talented young players|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  definitely|pg||
mb|6H|nt|sfoxa:  NS - one of the best Russian pair, national representetatives lot of times|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  helping hand from defence?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  for 10th trick|pg||
nt|rmb1: Help = playing diamonds for declarer|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  when in dbld partscore, always lead trump - this regulation rarely sucks |pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  looks impossible|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Even 2 is too high|pg||
pc|d7|nt|othered1: Our operator, William Hernebrink, advises sys on after W 1@h, 1NT on 1@c 8-11 balanced hand |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  3@h by NS looks good, even @h game is possible with non-accurate defence|pg||
nt|rmb1: The Polish specs agree it is not possible|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  hi John|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and hi John :)|pg||

nt|hedyg: even being last in this field is excellent :p|pg||
nt|kjadams: Love to know what 5N requested.    Certainly Jxxxxx would be a good Grand...|pg||
nt|jcwla: For most 5NT would confirm the presence of all keycards and the queen of trumps.|pg||
mb|1C|nt|jillan:  ormally not good when one puts on the breaks all the time and the other one has the gas pedal well footedf|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@C by N now, can be 15-17 balanced|pg||
nt|garnetts: 4@S will depend on how the spade suit is tackled |pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: alot of pdships actually work like that|pg||
nt|kjadams: but not after the Queen ask and denial|pg||
mb|1H|nt|sfoxa:  with 25 points, EW have no game to play, but NS can compete till 3@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: Likely 3NT|pg||
nt|bobholl: wheather he open 3 or 1@C they will reach 3nt|pg||
nt|stewball: 3nt coming|pg||
mb|1S|nt|garnetts: it is a complete guess |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  one more example of contemporary style - 1@d opening|pg||
nt|hedyg: too good for a 3@c opening|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Any game here's a challenge.... - perhaps 4@H the better|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|sfoxa:  NS have enough for the game, but bidding it looks easier than making|pg||
nt|hedyg: 6@c is on with the @d finesse|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzyv: Hello to all|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and EW - famous and experienced pair from the Netherlands |pg||
nt|bobholl: after the double 6@C looks good|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  rather marked with dbl|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|sharkey: Assume 2@D transfer to 2@H|pg||
nt|garnetts: actaully I am talking rubbish--need a coffee--you can't really get it wrong can you?  |pg||
nt|hedyg: now he just has to make it|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzyv: very cold)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  this time, looks easier as in previous board|pg||
mb|2N|nt|sfoxa:  looks like|pg||
nt|jcwla: A pretty moth-eaten vul opener but nothing sits too badly here.|pg||
nt|rmb1: or not|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  commentator's curse :)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  I'd opt for 3nt as well, but...|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  this time, another red suit must be ruffed to bring success for defence|pg||
nt|rmb1: Declarer can probably survive a @D ruff by South|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  For S, it's hard to imagine @d ruff is of no use this time|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  so, the right time to stick to the bridge table for round the day :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: or as Michael Barel says setting up the 5th @s|pg||
nt|hedyg: marked is assuming , W could well have the Q@D |pg||
mb|3H|nt|sharkey: 4@S may be ok too|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  NS can overboard easily|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  first board played was a good illustration of normal matter of course: bid what you have and lead what you have. Suppose, it will be repeated several times.|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: south looks at this fine spot and is happy he's not vulnerable|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  yes, both @h and @c are 3-3|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  altough without it, EW would hardly bid game|pg||
nt|bobholl: as he has the @H queen :)|pg||
nt|kjadams: Even with poor guessing this one should come home|pg||
nt|stewball: declarer doesnt know everything is sitting perfectly\|pg||
nt|kjadams: 9 with bad guesses, 11 with good guesses.|pg||
nt|stewball: @s seems to be 4/4 that will help|pg||
nt|kjadams: Lot's of speculation that it's extra length ask.   Seems reasonable, but can't confirm.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|sfoxa:  they are over 3nt, seemingly 4@h finishes the bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: I agree Sveta--everyone opens this sort of hand these days--except me--I prefer Roth-Stone ideology where first and second seat bids are sound |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  I can find 1 losing option: playing @sJ in the first round of the suit|pg||
nt|rmb1: Presumably East will run the 10 once he has checked his calculations|pg||
nt|hedyg: a question of timing now|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  as a kibitser pointed out, S like his hand much more than it's worth|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and only @h lead will beat this contract|pg||
nt|rmb1: Open room playing faster (3 boards scored).  Open room NS did not let through 4S on  27.  10IMP to Dutch|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  even  now, @h return creates problem for declarer|pg||
pc|d6|nt|othered1: and not doubled|pg||
nt|iceking: i would have liked N to bal with 1nt here instead of dbl|pg||
nt|sharkey: Trump lead best|pg||
nt|sharkey: But East on lead|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  attempt to pitch @d losers on @c will reduce W trump holding destined to 2 tricks anyway with this @h split|pg||
nt|sharkey: This plays better from N - else @S lead wud also disrupt communicarions|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  even with E hand, trump start looks better than any other|pg||
nt|sharkey: *communications|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  with @h continuation after @sA|pg||
pc|d3|nt|sfoxa:  declarer sees a lot of possibilities, I suppose|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  so, the question is which one to choose?|pg||
nt|sharkey: This is IMP scoring and the scores from all 8 tables are included.  On the Movie button you'll see the score from the other BBO table, but the IMP score may not be correct.|pg||
nt|sharkey: I think all options are losing ones Sveta|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  we are aware of it, not so declarer|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  let's see, how it goes. Should admit, trump lead created the biggest bundle of problems for declarer|pg||
pc|d7|nt|hedyg: and he has it right|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  juicy result for NS|pg||
nt|mareczek: 2@c - they play double checkback, so 2@c showed any invitational hand|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h8|nt|garnetts: South is trying to find a way of defeating this --but he can see there is virtually none by now unless a club trick is on the way |pg||
nt|jcwla: This hand could conceivably depend on W's rebid after 1@H - if W is on lead to NT, has an easy @C lead that might make the difference.|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|bobholl: but 5th @S will develop|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|jcwla: N that is.|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|nt|sfoxa:  this time, altough, both declarer and defence are on the thin path. 8 tricks aren't the question, but if somebody bids game...|pg||
pc|s9|nt|sfoxa:  @d lead was a kind of trap for declarer - playing this suit by himself, he'll rather find @d A onsite |pg||
nt|rmb1: Yes @H now succeed for defence|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  even @s brings a trick now |pg||
nt|rmb1: Oh|pg||
pc|c4|nt|othered1: Did the double distinguish between possible hands?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  that way seems better than other options|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cT|pc|c6|pg||
nt|kjadams: club shift found in time|pg||
pc|c8|nt|sfoxa:  case closed|pg||
pc|c3|nt|hedyg: i doubt everybody will bid this slam|pg||
pc|c9|nt|bobholl: i guess only 1/3|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|hedyg: if that many|pg||
pc|c7|nt|sfoxa:  altought the battle isn't over|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cQ|pc|s5|pg||
pc|h4|nt|sharkey: East @S duck may be expensive|pg||
nt|sharkey: Makes now - huge score to Drijver|pg||
nt|rmb1: This was good enough.  But declarer could succeed on the unlikely line of ruffing a @C honour, discarding @H10 on @DK|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  exactly|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|nt|iceking: probably just takout, 1@C though is limited to max 17hcp so with this pattern and texture of the hand i would have bid 1nt playing this system|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hK|nt|sfoxa:  S has to return @c to make declarer feel uncomfortable|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hT|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mareczek: I think that S should bid 4@s splinter after 3@d|pg||
nt|mareczek: than NS could stop before slam|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  yes, would have been better|pg||
pc|s7|pc|cJ|nt|sfoxa:  that is expensive indeed|pg||

pc|s4|nt|yuval10: the X by South looks quite reasonable, when you have most of the points ( as he figured out by N's X ) , it's hardly a good tactics to let opps play in their 8 cards fit|pg||

mb|2C!|nt|sfoxa:  oh. I'm wrong.  but can't agree with considering N's hand as destructive one|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@H=@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: what should w bid here|pg||
nt|iceking: 3@H maybe |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  contemporary openings became lighter till impossible - S hand wasn't opening worth in accordance with Acol standartds |pg||
nt|mareczek: http://www.bridgemoscow.ru/tournaments/results/slava11/slava11t16r2.htm|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  this one looks better|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  this wouldn't prevent EW from bidding high, suppose|pg||
mb|p|nt|mareczek: running scoers|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  EW would better to stop low|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@S denies 4 cards|pg||
nt|kjadams: Interesting point John.   Smith in that case would say I am known not to have the Jack, therefore encouraging is extra length.   Still requires sound agreements.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: N Splinter bid 4@H - as suggested by kib|pg||
nt|mareczek: scores|pg||
nt|garnetts: Spotlight on South now |pg||
nt|stewball: i think the NS action in the OR guaranteed they would bid slam|pg||
nt|stewball: propelled them|pg||
nt|kjadams: not to have T. |pg||
nt|stewball: 4@s now?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Roberto Martínez|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  as for me, 2 aces isn't my dream hand for Multi (desctructive) opening|pg||
nt|garnetts: well done |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  once more - lucky NS, this time with @h split |pg||
nt|garnetts: I think the North hand is too good for a weak two--nearer to a strong two in my view lol :)  |pg||
nt|hedyg: here without transfer bids N could hardly enter the bidding|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jillan:  3NT should make....|pg||
nt|jillan:  or could anyhow|pg||
nt|othered1: This hand might work better without the 2@C opening -- a common result with a minor 1-suiter|pg||
nt|Walddk2: scroll back :)|pg||
nt|iceking: horrible hand in any system|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes Ed, but what is your rebid after 1@D  1M?|pg||
nt|hedyg: A@s and 3 @ds|pg||
nt|bobholl: they have to defend carefully to beat it|pg||
pc|h5|nt|sharkey: Today I think all players would open 3rd hand - many also 1. & 2. hand|pg||
nt|ybob: Hi Roland, hi everyone|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  hello Roberto|pg||
nt|ybob: Hello :)|pg||
nt|ybob: what is 1@D by S ?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  good question|pg||
nt|ybob: i agree with 1@H but i like pass 1@S|pg||
nt|ybob: 1@D = no 5M|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  declarer has no chance to play @c wrong, and 1 trick in @s is enough|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|othered1: 2 other major|pg||
nt|othered1: easy|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|iceking: 2sp probably over 1@H if you open 1@D |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Ah, Italian style|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Excellent treatment|pg||
nt|iceking: i cant see open this east hand 1@D |pg||
nt|jillan:  me neither|pg||
nt|sharkey: 10 or 11 tricks here - coffee time...|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  oh, really - 3rd hand allows that. I disregarded this "pecularity".|pg||
nt|ybob: pd shows 5@S so this shows limits values|pg||
pc|h8|nt|sharkey: EW may have missed a good sac|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  all in all - @s game is cool|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  agree, 1@s looks better even with 2cards by W|pg||
pc|h6|nt|jcwla: Not my idea of a red weak 2 in @H's with 12 "berries": A 10 K 9 Q 6 J 5 T 4 9 2 8 1 -- would want more like 18.  And yet again S defers to N's "hearts."  Really surprised @S's not ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: mentioned at all, deep position.|pg||
nt|kjadams: possible auction confusion here?|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|iceking: problem doing so is you have such a powerful hand, you will need rest of your bidding trying to recover |pg||
nt|Walddk2: I can because a jump in the other major is artificial as I play it|pg||
nt|bobholl: now 3 @D|pg||
pc|d4|nt|iceking: and usually end up just guessing |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Can be a hand too good for a 3@D rebid|pg||
nt|ybob: 5 tricks by EW|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and points count should help avoid @h finess |pg||
nt|hedyg: a slow 3@ds :)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|othered1: Actually, in Kaplan-Sheinwold, it can go 1@D -1M - 3@D forcing|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  guessing @c right ends declarer's problems, even if not, he can escape finding W with short @h but 2 trumps only|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  oh! I'm wrong|pg||
nt|kjadams: well done|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ybob: now K ?|pg||
nt|ybob: K shows 3@C and good time to play another @S from N|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  NS have to attack @d in time|pg||
nt|ybob: @D will play from S|pg||
nt|ybob: K@C , @S, and S low @D |pg||
nt|stewball: next|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|jcwla: Evidently.|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c8|nt|iceking: but it doesnt show a hand to good for 1@D opening:)|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|othered1: showing a hand you'd have opened 2@C if suit were a major and you have hand an extra natural bid along the way.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I try to avoid opening 2@C with a long minor, especially diamonds|pg||
pc|d6|nt|othered1: have had|pg||
nt|rmb1: A Roland slam, missed and not making 12 :)|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dJ|pc|d5|pg||
nt|iceking: i agree its the worsed seq after 2@C opening|pg||
nt|othered1: If you generally open old-fashioned soundly, you get some edges on the big hands . . |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  EW have piece of luck as well - S is holding @s 6 ( not 10) fourth|pg||
nt|hedyg: i dont think he can avoid 3@H losers|pg||
pc|c9|nt|mareczek: 4@c + 4@s + ruff + @hAK +@dA = 12|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Sigurbjörn|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  EW are granted wit 1 trick|pg||
nt|bessi2: hi all|pg||
nt|ybob: hi :)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  hello|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sfoxa:  after all, 12 tricks are here|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  good move by N - his only chance is @s, not @d|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c7|pg||
nt|othered1: If I jump shift without a fit, the field likely would have opened 2@C|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sharkey: After previous hand de Wijs and Muller may still be "shell shocked"|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  cheap escape|pg||
nt|hedyg: or 3@cs :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: i think he makes or 2@C 3@H or 2@H 3@C losers|pg||
nt|hedyg: i am not sure what a @s from E would have provoked as defense|pg||
nt|bobholl: @S 8 growing :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: there was no entry to the S hand so playing K@s was np|pg||
pc|cT|nt|sfoxa:  yes, Marek, you are correct|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  last board of the round. next one is starting soon, so stay with Russian frost! thank you for watching and sharing your ideas|pg||

mb|1C|nt|jcwla: If they bid and make a bunch of spades against you on that last one, crawl back in bed.|pg||

mb|1S!|nt|ybob: good result to Ew, NS win 8 tricks NT|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and the number of boards played provides you with pros and cons of your approach. |pg||
nt|rmb1: 4@C lead directing with @H fit ?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|kjadams: You will find two events there.    A "top 16" which is what we are watching.|pg||
nt|kjadams: It is invitational only and has only superstars|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: i guess you overcall 1@S |pg||
nt|othered1: impossible because east won't let it play|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  after all, yes. good for EW|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  this trump suit is better in W's point of view|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Each round consist of 8 board and the scoring is on IMPs converted to VPs - max score per round is 60-0|pg||
nt|jcwla: From the nature of this W bed it looks like E probably meant the 2@C on prev hand as xfr cuebid.|pg||
nt|jcwla: bid not bed.|pg||
mb|d|nt|othered1: Wow, east is really walking t his|pg||
nt|Walddk2: As the cards lie, EW can make 5@D|pg||
nt|iceking: and should make|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If you guess diamonds|pg||
nt|bobholl: only a @H lead keeps 3NT on 9 tricks|pg||
nt|hedyg: imo Gino thought Bessis had 4 cards in @H|pg||
nt|stewball: an uncomfortable 3@d i'm sure|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Top spot, 3NT by N|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  makes sense in that meaning namely|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  could help E decide either to defend or not|pg||
mb|2N|nt|sharkey: West's 2@D is transfer to @H - either to play or GF I assume|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  hm, will S decide to convert this dbl into penalty?|pg||
nt|sharkey: No - dont think so - choice between pest and cholera....|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  it would be useful for NS, but hardly possible|pg||

mb|p|nt|othered1: Now east is sure to guess @D|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  Round 4 of Slava Cup in progress. torunament site http://www.slavacup.com/tournament.htm|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  don't be surprised with the opening - 1@c can include 5332 with 5@d, 1@d opening - unbalanced hands|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: East bid 5@D all by himself|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  defence can prevent declarer from 9th trick, but it isn't obvious|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  now S has to cash @c A and continue @h |pg||
nt|hedyg: everybody will lead @h|pg||
pc|c8|nt|sfoxa:  bearing in mind, W may pass in the first round and re-open with DBL thereafter, EW can land into 3@d - not so easy to beat|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  W can beat 4@s underleading @h ace, and even without this lead, defenders will take 1 heart and 2 club tricks|pg||
nt|kjadams: 8 tricks if guess clubs.|pg||
pc|c7|nt|jillan:  he got HIGH from the last hand >)(|pg||
nt|iceking: neither table overcalled 4@S |pg||
nt|sharkey: NS are off to a good start and won't take unnecessary risks I think|pg||
pc|cK|nt|othered1: I guess I thought east was walking this before I saw the other table's actions.  Inconceivable that I"d sell to 3@D|pg||
nt|iceking: i bid in my world is just clear-cut |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  matter of overtricks|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|stewball: this will require very careful play |pg||
pc|s7|nt|sfoxa:  exactly|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  but the matter of course would be rather the same (2@h instead of 2@d for pairs not using transfers)|pg||
nt|garnetts: excellent play to lead the @D earlier but it wont help |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  3 clubs, sorry|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sK|nt|rmb1: Yes.  So 5@H is a phantom|pg||

pc|h9|nt|sfoxa:  actually, we should disregard the scores here - it's pair tournament with IMPs scoring across the field|pg||
pc|hQ|mc|5|nt|sharkey: This is a Pair Contest with IMP score.  EW and NS all play on the Dutch National team and are pitted against each other first round|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  these pairs faced each other last year in Ostend representing their countries|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  actually, Top-16 of the Slava Cup consisted of top stars of nations |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  after 3 rounds, the NS are 4th and EW- 3rd, as you may guess|pg||

nt|kjadams: spade finesse first since that has reentry if fails.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sharkey: Surprised W didnt bid game Game  - Vul Bonus being 500|pg||
nt|sharkey: Not a good round for EW|pg||
nt|mareczek: 5@c looks like sensible |pg||
nt|mareczek: contract|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  declarer has to work hard to escape to 1 down only|pg||
nt|bobholl: may be he loses 3 @D :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@s was cold so np to go off|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  he got a chance|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  not at ll, but E can rely on several pts by partner - 1NT was passed by N |pg||
pc|d3|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  to collect 9 tricks in 3@d is much easier than in 3NT|pg||
nt|kjadams: If north has king and ducks, back to guessing.|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|iceking: he is very lucky not going minus  420 here vs his own 650  imo|pg||
nt|jcwla: "For the rich they sing."|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sfoxa:  wow! they are more ambitious |pg||
nt|mareczek: even after club lead it makes...|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  E has to establish @d s to win|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  looks like their agreement worked as well|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Walddk2: Are we heading for a major upset? Boye B's are hot favourites despite the 21 IMP handicap they sustained|pg||
nt|mareczek: E takes in hand, cashes @dA, crosses toi the dummy with @cQ, ruffs diamod high, draws trumps and concedes @d|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  now it's possible to score 4 ruffs in dummy|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|cA|nt|othered1: but some of us dont like to get our shorter suit into the auction as an initial action.  West likely thought he's have another chance, then just chose to "stay fixed."|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|nt|othered1: Some fix.|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|iceking: Is there a link Roland to Boyes fan club|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cK|nt|sharkey: As Sveta pointed out a creative 3 NT from W may also have worked on @HQ lead|pg||
nt|garnetts: the cards again lie well |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  @s return can create communication troubles, but slightly ones only|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|bvdahl: I'd bet anything that Boye B would be winning after scoring the first 38 IMP's of the match|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|nt|bobholl: made now :)|pg||
pc|dK|pc|c5|pg||
nt|hedyg: huge chance|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c6|nt|sfoxa:  good S's move - keeping communication line open |pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s6|nt|mareczek: position of @cJ is good for declarer, but she cannot be sure|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  W can't be sure about winning option - he has a lot of |pg||
nt|kjadams: note that the finesse in clubs would not help, so Ace and another played.|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s2|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  each discard means rejecting an option|pg||
pc|h3|nt|sfoxa:  yes, it's very interesting, how would she proceed|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hK|nt|bessi2: normal result for n-s but if I were to pick a pair most likely to score +620 it would be Lauria - Versace|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  @c return looks better - making table one more card (and option) shorter|pg||
pc|hA|pg||

nt|iceking: these hands we been getting are wild|pg||
nt|othered1: Not the worse slam ever seen here.|pg||
nt|othered1: worst|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I'd be in grand|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  they have 3 more boards|pg||
nt|mareczek: livescores|pg||
mb|p|nt|ybob: 9 tricks NT here|pg||
nt|jcwla: The N hand looks about average for my pds when I have the S hand.|pg||
nt|kjadams: Never see Adam misguess the Queen when it matters, only for the overtrick.|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|sfoxa:  that's the way squeezes are working :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|bvdahl: without a @c lead, 6@h is cold|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|iceking: cant really see how you miss slam here|pg||
nt|othered1: 5 or 7 hand, but only on @C lead. |pg||
nt|Walddk2: New philosophy, I only bid the slams that make|pg||
nt|bvdahl: so it is not really a 5 or 7 hand, is it?|pg||
nt|rnc: It looks like bad coaching from the captain. Who to blame? Me of course, since I'm the guilty one...:)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  do they still playing with you, such a lucky guy? :) |pg||
nt|garnetts: Everything normal here|pg||
mb|1S|nt|iceking: no you should play 6 on @C lead you can play @D 2 times and pich @C|pg||
nt|mareczek: dbl. = "pass or correct"|pg||
nt|mareczek: now NS in troubles|pg||
nt|mareczek: even 3@h after trump lead does not look well|pg||
nt|ybob: 1@S= neg X without @S |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  but here EW should find their way to 3NT|pg||
nt|mareczek: once again strong club|pg||
mb|d|nt|bvdahl: yes|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  lie of the cards is better for NS than for EW, but EW have more power|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  so it goes...|pg||
mb|r|nt|bessi2: not familiar with n-s system here but suprising to see a 1@c and not 1@d opening|pg||
nt|ybob: they play 1@C p 1@D = no 5M|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  S should consider his @h lenght as a stopper and bid game|pg||
nt|ybob: 2@H bid now|pg||
nt|jcwla: Beautiful hand to lead from... meanwhile the Rabbi is busy this set.|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  can't imagine SO helpful hand from defence to allow declarer making it|pg||
nt|hedyg: the leaders bid 6@c as well|pg||
nt|bobholl: wasn't young bessis afraid he was stolen from :)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  S must have been embarraced a little bit|pg||
nt|mareczek: when S will show diwmond suit, will N go to the slam?|pg||
nt|kjadams: I really dislike that redouble.   your partner gives you the chance to preemt, you take it.|pg||
nt|mareczek: I think 3@s wouldwork better than rdbl|pg||
mb|2D|nt|bvdahl: so 6 is more or less 75%|pg||
nt|othered1: in 2/1, west would be 80 percent of the way to slam.  In EW''s acol style, it may not be|pg||
mb|p|nt|fluff: preempt with 4333 ?|pg||
nt|mareczek: N knows that somebody must be joking|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|othered1: 4@D? |pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@D probably a fragment|pg||
nt|Walddk2: or maybe just a cue bid|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  S has got one more chance to bid|pg||
mb|d|nt|mareczek: yes...|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  lesser evil|pg||
nt|stewball: not a lot of imps in these hands so far|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  looks like average, but each option - 10, 11 or 12 tricks - is possible |pg||
nt|kjadams: a puppet stayman auction.   Right system for these cards.|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  rather not 10|pg||
nt|jcwla: Against big club if ever but in any case - what is the XX?  And still another X?|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: doesn't that normally imply shortness in 4th suit?|pg||
nt|rnc: Cue, I'm told (sitting 2 mtrs from the table)|pg||
nt|iceking: good bidding with no extras w will bid 6@H now |pg||
nt|rnc: Should be short, in my opinion|pg||
nt|bvdahl: in the CR, EW used 5 bids to get to 4@h. Here they might use less than that to arrive in slam...|pg||
nt|bvdahl: 5 bidding rounds|pg||
nt|othered1: Quite a comeback for Vintage.|pg||
nt|iceking: east bidding in closed room looks just surreal |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  this one doesn't looks very special|pg||
nt|sharkey: should be off as dummy very short of entries.....|pg||
nt|mareczek: they have found the contract which is difficult do double|pg||
nt|mareczek: East knows that they have 5 tricks|pg||
nt|mareczek: should play spade after @cA|pg||
nt|mareczek: otherwise, declarer can play @sJ|pg||
nt|mareczek: and if W will not cash the spades, EW can be in troubles|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  to create problems for declarer,N have to lead opp's suit - @s|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  @c lead appears helpful|pg||
nt|jcwla: Would you have passed throughout as S, Sveta?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  first lead well choosen - E is known to have more points than W, so N hopes to find partner with some values|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  even without @c swith now, declarer has to concede 4 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  5@d is good as well|pg||
nt|ybob: S prefer wait to bid NT if pd has H stiff|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  well done!|pg||
mb|3H|nt|sharkey: Dont see how East can avoid @D loser|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  would have considering this option, but triple, not only twicr|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  *twice, sorry|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  this time, @s lead had worked as well|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  but the most interesting point - this contract could be made|pg||
nt|mareczek: usually in this position East's bidding causes the most suspicions|pg||
mb|p|nt|ybob: now pass|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|iceking: ok iam trying to see what extras W has someone help me|pg||
nt|bvdahl: good philosophy. Bid the contract that makes|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  with @d split 3-3, one @d finess and one ruff is enough|pg||
mb|d|nt|Walddk2: If the Vintage team advance the good news for us is that Hed and Andersson will be available as operators for future broadcasts :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: If it's Rosenkranz style I dislike it with the queen (even tho that is part of the book treatment).|pg||
mb|r|nt|Walddk2: Although we don't need them when we have William and Magnus. They are great!|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  what should be S's next move?|pg||
nt|bobholl: 9 of @D|pg||
nt|bobholl: or Q|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  that's great|pg||
nt|hedyg: Thomas is afraid of nothing :p|pg||
nt|hedyg: 10hcps out of 16 in opps suits|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|sfoxa:  no dbl - no trouble, will S think seeing the dummy|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  squeeze can really work, if S have been playing small @s at the first trick keeping 10@s as a menace at the table|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|rnc: Don't forget there is a Consolation Cup too. But I might bench them to do the broadcasting... :):)|pg||
nt|othered1: That's strong willed of them -- I might be out the door, never to return (during this event.)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  but not this time, yes|pg||
nt|sharkey: can only get to dummy by playing @H - thus no ruff|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  alas|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  helpful hand from defence?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  not from this players, though|pg||
nt|sharkey: B has shown @C by X I think - S may contionue with @CK and more @C|pg||
nt|sharkey: *N|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  start was good from both sides. let's see the next move |pg||
pc|s6|pc|s2|pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|sfoxa:  is 5 high enough to be promoted? yes, it is. |pg||

nt|bobholl: thomas had gldly missed his @D 9 :)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|sfoxa:  first attempt to gain 9th trick failed|pg||
nt|bobholl: gladly|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|kjadams: unfortunate that North did not support diamonds at some point.|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h4|nt|sfoxa:  4 @d rounds force 4 discards from dummy, hence @c  |pg||
