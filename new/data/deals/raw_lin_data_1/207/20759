nt|vugraphznu: Buongiorno a tutti!|pg||
nt|gluckenval: Un po' più semplice il cammino dell'Olanda che ha battuto l'Islanda per 233-142 ma con l'incontro in ghiaccio dopo soli 3 segmenti. |pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|cumino: COme stile con le carte di Nord si può o aprire o passare e poi dichiarare molto. Io preferisco la seconda. |pg||
mb|1H|nt|caruga: anche io ma Norb invece no|pg||
mb|1N|mb|2S|an|weak|mb|3N|nt|katar: buongiorno :)|pg||
nt|katar: speriamo di non soffrire troppo stamani :)|pg||
nt|toniemme: ciao tutti..|pg||
nt|cumino: 1SA ovest è stato favorevole a Norby, il 2@S suo è debole, se no avrebbe contrato|pg||
nt|toniemme: hai problemi legarti all'età?..vuoi antidolorifico?|pg||
nt|katar: ehehehe no no tranqui :)|pg||
nt|remo: ciao a tutti dal Mottarone|pg||
nt|caruga: farà freschino...|pg||
nt|toniemme: urka presenza di alpini e assimilati...|pg||

mb|4C!|mb|d|mb|4D|nt|toniemme: Remo pare Modugno...e intanto sud fa scegliere a Nord in quale colore giocare a livello 4...|pg||
nt|remo: S mostra il doppio fit...:)|pg||
nt|katar: buona dichiarazione di Madala che lascia la scelta a norberto di chimare 4 picche se è quinto o 4 quadri se ha la 6/4 o 7/4|pg||
nt|tax456: a me sembra che si guadagna sta mano .di la giocano 3sa i nostri e vanno 1 down|pg||
mb|p|nt|toniemme: 4@D è realizzabile...|pg||
mb|p|nt|remo: anche quattricche, no?|pg||
nt|tax456: att fiori è piu dura|pg||
nt|toniemme: oggi vi sento meno agitati e nervosi eppure i nostri devono recuperare.......|pg||
nt|katar: si si tutte e due si fanno, non c'è rischio di fuorigioco a picche enè di surtagli|pg||
nt|cumino: Il passo di Drijver su 3SA contrati dal suo è abbastanza coraggioso per usare un eufemismo. Se W aveva J!J facevano le prime 9|pg||
nt|cumino: J@H|pg||
nt|tax456: infatti una piccola assicurazione ci sta|pg||
nt|tax456: magari le contra..|pg||

nt|xenya: hard to tell where all that will end|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: I will enter the bids 2 and 2 |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: so that the players have no chance to know who might be fast or slow at the other side of the screen|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: what about a good practical bid|pg||
nt|desinka: welcome|pg||
nt|ady: 2@D shows one of the major suits|pg||
nt|ady: Nortj will be very surprised its spades|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 2nt=Lebensohl|pg||
nt|ady: 1NT with stiff king not usual|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Herbsts play Nat, Acol based, Major 5, better minor|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 1@C natural but may be a two card suit|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hi Traian.|pg||
nt|bobholl: they won't bid 3nt anymore i guess :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: FREAK hand for north first up|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: Somers and Both both from Belgium according to their badge|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi naresh|pg||
mb|3N|nt|vugraphznv: hi all - and wlc to Veldhoven|pg||
nt|lechcold: witam|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: hi Victor|pg||
nt|lml: hello|pg||
nt|lml: this auction is following the same lines as in the Open Room|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: it is Stansby taking a pause here|pg||
nt|lml: the trick will be the opening lead against a 6 level contract by north south|pg||
nt|panosk: gd morning to all|pg||
nt|ady: 2NT  leb   3@D direct would be forcing to game I would think|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: We have some huge technical problems with the PC and internet connections here in the closed room|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: SORRY for that|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: We are getting some technical assistance- and will try to be back very soon |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: we know you are doing all you can Jan, no worries|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: I do|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: And the bidding on Board 18 in this room went |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 2@h opening from E|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: DBL by S|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 3@h (preempt)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: pass fromN|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Pass from E|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: DBL by S|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: then N bid 4@c|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: going down 2|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: South thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: he took the pass card out|pg||
nt|fabsayc: fallenius may cue bid 4@S|pg||
nt|hlortz: both sides can make a lot of tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: a relatively peaceful hand, for starters?|pg||
nt|hedyg:  EW CC: http://tinyurl.com/66ttlf5|pg||
nt|szalay: wd u reopen as West?|pg||
nt|barnets: playing 3N in open|pg||
nt|kit: Pachtman knows his partner is short in hearts.  What he doesn't know about is the club fit.  But he can see 9 tricks.|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: South in the tank|pg||
nt|barnets: same bidding in open south passed|pg||
nt|kit: if South finds a 4@C call, North can reasonably bid the slam.|pg||
nt|kit: But bidding 4@C is a pretty big position I think.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: and likely pass here too. S has no bid for that matter.|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: he is still thinking|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Can't NS make 6@C?|pg||
nt|kit: of course they can|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: hi Geoffrey|pg||
nt|roswolf: i might have overcalled 1nt as east|pg||
nt|nkgupt: hi david,geoff|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3nt is somewhat of a punt|pg||
nt|ady: north bidding his shape if not his hcp|pg||
nt|roswolf: who needs points!?|pg||
nt|ady: better than 4@H  they may have got to with a free run|pg||
nt|roswolf: if south doubles the azurri may run but if he doesnt then they might make|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: Bulgaria bid 6@S in Open Room|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Round 10 and Israel are performing well while Bulgaria are lower in the table than their recent form|pg||
nt|odysseus69: the dreaded xxx opposite xxx as stopper- 3H from West should show values|pg||
nt|xenya: this may well make on a spade lead|pg||
nt|desinka: hello Panos:)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 2@C GF relay|pg||
nt|roswolf: apart from the hcp he has an empty hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: south with both majors(though weak) is strangely silent|pg||
nt|gracelin: Hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|star6ija: hello everybody :)|pg||
nt|ady: it appears the contract n/s is 6@S    not all bid in 1 go|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: dzien dobry|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Then ???  3NT - Pass???|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: @sA in hand|pg||
nt|xenya: which is likely|pg||
nt|lml: in the OR they led the @SA|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and N still dont know what majorsuit S has|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: he passed slowly :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: hi|pg||
nt|lml: its fun to watch my friends play from Canada play the talented Israeli pair|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, and why not?|pg||
nt|lml: do you think Stansby should double for a diamond lead?|pg||
nt|lml: is it possible to figure this out?|pg||
nt|ady: north must still think hearts south suit|pg||
nt|kit: perhaps he should get a small bonus for thinking :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: lol true|pg||
nt|roswolf: t/o dbl of hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|lechcold: ze Szwecj¹ nigdy nie by³o ³atwo i czêciej oni nas lali ni¿ my ich...zobaczymy|pg||
nt|lechcold: witamy naszego vugrafa:)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Barel chose the natural option|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@H is not so clear as a cue bid, not sure the intent|pg||
nt|ahollan1: IMPs for Netherlands from carryover of head-to-head match in Round Robin|pg||
nt|gracelin: China is behind by 37 imps but there are 48 boards to go.  So all is not finished yet.|pg||
nt|roswolf: well they shouldnt|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm a quick defeat likely|pg||
nt|ady: cannot make on any lead    just 8 tricks|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ryskiel_: witam w kolejnym dzisiejszym meczu, ostatnim|pg||
nt|ady: 4@D down 1 on best defence|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Bulgaria at the moment in 9th |pg||
nt|ady: must set up 2 heart tricks before clubs are established|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: so they would need some VPs to get in the top 8|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: "You often have singletons opening 1nt?" asks S|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: dziñ dobry - witam w przedostatniej rundzie RR - dru¿yna polska spotyka siê z reprezentacj¹ Islandii|pg||
nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: hi Vladimir|pg||
nt|bobholl: didn't north know it was natural ?|pg||
nt|roswolf: ok a slow defeat|pg||
pc|d3|nt|lml: theoretically this should go one down, 1 heart, 1 spade and 2 diamonds|pg||
nt|odysseus69: and now doomed for 1 down in 5D|pg||
nt|hlortz: pass or correct type bid perhaps with 5@D in reserve if needed|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Traian|pg||
nt|hedyg:  NS CC: http://tinyurl.com/67anzfx|pg||
nt|szalay: I think 2@S is likely move now|pg||
nt|hantveit:  |pg||
pc|d5|nt|rnmalik: 3@C a better spot for NS.|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: South is still a junior, don't know his age exactly|pg||
nt|panosk: gm Dessy|pg||
nt|panosk: gm Pim|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: gm|pg||
nt|oosmanb: losing 1@H and 2@C should be very quick for sementa|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: action to start with :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other tables visible without login via http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php   one window per table|pg||
nt|roswolf: well that was aggressive|pg||
nt|bobholl: east not feeling to happy now :)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Hi everyone|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: West: i should have passed 2@h when he puts dummy down|pg||
nt|jbgood: so that explains the double:)|pg||
nt|panosk: it was easy that will make it easier|pg||
nt|skaftij:  3nt could have been a bit difficult to defend against, might need to overtake @C Q and lead a @S through|pg||
nt|olegario: not much can be done, they have gone a bit too high up|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: hi Olegario...welcome|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Now the defense is easy|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Hi olegario :-)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: both pairs  upside-down count & attitude|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ady: both sides have great fits   but both limited to 9 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Never says W and laughs|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: E agrees // we newer has .. did I have one :)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|vugraphznv: declarer claiming 12 tricks -- but Versace rejects - only 11 tricks he says|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 2@C shows 5+ @H , 10+|pg||
nt|odysseus69: they have screamed for club lead so no chance of anything else|pg||
nt|desinka: yes, seem like a flat board to me|pg||
nt|olegario: Hello skaftij :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this looks like a crazy double to me, getting a diamond ruff wont set 4@S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i meant on its own, he does not know about partners spade ace|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: K@C out diamond switch and spade ace and again diamond|pg||
nt|bobholl: hi oosman |pg||
pc|c3|nt|lml: Lindop has to rise on a spade to the jack now|pg||
nt|jbgood: NS's system card: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2011Veldhoven/BermudaBowl/Australia/edgtton-gosney.pdf|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: a kib tells me he is only 19|pg||
nt|desinka: seems|pg||
nt|hlortz: i woud have thought south would bid 5@C 2 way bid make or cheap save|pg||
nt|hlortz: best lead!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: my point was fredin does not even know one club is cashing|pg||
nt|hlortz: very true|pg||
nt|hlortz: takes @H ruffs to beat 5@C|pg||
nt|roswolf: lead should sign post the correct line|pg||
nt|gracelin: surprised that Madala is not bidding at all with 5-4 major and 6 pts.  NS seems to be making 2S|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed patrick but need some imps back early i feel|pg||
nt|roswolf: maybe too much wine last night!?|pg||
nt|gracelin: sure, Geoffrey, a most difficlt task, but not hopeless.|pg||
nt|roswolf: so much of this game is momentum thus giving you a feel good factor|pg||
nt|gracelin: however, with clubs not breaking, EW can't make even 1NT.|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: I saw him in the bar last night, but he wasn't drinking alcohol|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N = NF   2@C=a) 10-13, (3)4+@C  b) 14-15, not 55|pg||
nt|bobholl: i don't know their ranges but 3 nt is surely too high|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 4@c showed that N has a 3-5-5-0 hand and minimum|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: N has described a weak 5530|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm|pg||
nt|ahollan1: as with Round Robin,  all matches in all events playing the same boards|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so 2@H = 5@S 4@H  14-15|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry Dennis already entered those explanations|pg||
pc|cT|nt|gracelin: is Madala still below 18?|pg||

nt|jbgood: 2@h was 8-11, that is why S dared to double 2@s|pg||
nt|skaftij:  In OR, Baldursson playing quietly in 1NT so first blood to Iceland|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Quarter Final & Semi Final matches  96 boards|pg||
nt|roswolf: all going swimmingly|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: ah team discipline is good then maybe just drinking the npc's brand of coffee|pg||
nt|bobholl: after a 12-14 nt they didn't probably discuss that 3@D is to play|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Somers pass was alerted|pg||

nt|ryskiel_: USA 2 ogra³o W³ochów...jak poradzi sobie z nimi nasza dru¿yna?|pg||

pc|c7|nt|lechcold: na drugim stole Buras-Narkiewicz vs Hurd-Wooldridge|pg||
nt|ady: defence got of to good start  so down 1|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|lml: maybe not ... I guess he will still come to 2 diamond tricks|pg||
pc|cK|nt|kiwibridge: Brink presses on|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: can ruff 3@C in dummy |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: exiting first hand // a gameforce relay bidding here - and an Ice-relay bidding in then open room|pg||
nt|nkgupt: -1 may not be a bad score ...4@s is making i think|pg||
nt|nkgupt: by @c's can be forced only twice|pg||
nt|ady: would be easy with 7-5 to have bid higher   Netherlands might have the edge on this hand getting a plus|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes it might but is it biddable with west making a strong noise - doubt it myself but the azurri are a law unto themselves|pg||
nt|roswolf: a spec observes "kept EW out of 4@h"|pg||
nt|bobholl: Bas is feeling the pressure already :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: btw the home support for team orange is awesome judging by the messages i receive:)|pg||
nt|nkgupt:  |pg||
nt|ady: only danger for Netherlands  in OR  they some way get to 4@H|pg||
nt|bobholl: or lose to 170|pg||

nt|bobholl: ah ha clarification from a kibitzer pass promised 8-11|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ady: good save against 3@S|pg||
nt|xenya: N's decision to play 3N rather than 4@S with a 4-3-3-3 shape is understandable but quite unlucky|pg||
nt|runnerup: hi all|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Markku|pg||
nt|runnerup: hi vladimit|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: director here|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: i will explain everything at the end of the hand|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: director in the room with us|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: hi Ruud and yes indeed Iceland have also bid grand|pg||
nt|boedhy:  can you go wrong|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Hi Ruud|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: not as they lie, but you could have on Qxx trumps offside|pg||
nt|boedhy:  you cannt draw trumps i think|pg||
nt|boedhy:  ah iceland went down after two times trump|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and Iceland went down 1 in the closed room|pg||

mb|p|nt|xenya: i wonder how it was made|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S=natural, one round force     or   2@D Relay ??|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: if both USA 1 and USA 2 qualify for the Semi-Finals they have to play against each other|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@S suggested too    i'm too tired to think of that on my own|pg||
mb|1H|nt|athene: hi good afternoon everyone|pg||

nt|xenya: yet more action on this one|pg||
nt|lml: 4@H is not a terrible contract but it wont make here|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 1@D=a) 0-7 HCP  b) 8+ HCP, 0-1 controls|pg||

nt|mdgraham: good afternoon all|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: hello Mike|pg||
nt|bobholl: west has 2@H raise with q's and j's|pg||
nt|hantveit: 4h is a goo contract. in practice on h 2-2 or stiff q = 52%|pg||
nt|ady: e/w will finish in 4@H   and should make in spite of 4-1 trump split|pg||
mb|3S|an|16+ with 4!H|nt|ady: 11 tricks looks ok for e/w|pg||
nt|stoffers: So, Italy has started in great fashion (as usual), but iceland has some work to do|pg||
nt|lml: 5@C probably can't either|pg||
nt|lml: well double dummy you could draw one trump|pg||
nt|lml: and ruff the fourth spade|pg||
nt|xenya: i think both contracts are makeable, DD |pg||
nt|panosk: interesting board competition wise|pg||

nt|ady: sure they will be content with game|pg||
nt|hantveit: good, I have som problems with my keyboard and the letter d|pg||

nt|odysseus69: an alternative route is for East to raise NT - the xxx in clubs suggests a problem which existed|pg||
nt|lml: well we might find out about whether Martel can make 5@C in a minute|pg||
nt|lml: I think it is pretty double dummy but maybe he will find it|pg||
nt|xenya: still the bidding just  might put S |pg||
nt|lml: to make 5@C you draw one round of trump and ruff the fourth spade in dummy|pg||
nt|xenya: on the right track|pg||
nt|xenya: in 4@H|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: and E had an easy pass|pg||
nt|xenya: presenting declarer with a 9th trick|pg||
nt|runnerup: mean while slam -by guessing @d -like 50% -yuo finess rigth way -makes this time|pg||
nt|gracelin: sme West may cobnsider this hand suitable for 4D over 1S to show a strong 6-4.|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT   easier    but should be ok|pg||
nt|roswolf: team orange started with a 2 imp carryover from the RR|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|lml: south might have bid double |pg||
nt|jbgood: both these pairs play transfers after 1@c .... and some more|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: West didn't alert 2@C|pg||
nt|panosk: many advocate 2@D 1st and then double if u have to|pg||
nt|desinka: yes, but with Qx@S .. in vuln..|pg||

nt|ahollan1: wijs-muller   playing Tarzan Precision  also reached 4@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: our EW pair play  Ice-Relay  aka  Icelandic Relay|pg||
nt|barnets: trump lead will beat this |pg||
nt|kit: key which suit Levin leads.  If he leads a club, I don't think 3@H will make.  If he leads a diamond, it will make.|pg||
nt|gracelin: still others may want to try 4C Splinter|pg||
nt|roswolf: maybe but sensible bridge is the order of the day on most hands if you get some freakish distributions then comes the time for flair and imagination|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Ok just been told, only non vul, 2 openings are 0-7 at least 4 cards, pass = 8-11|pg||
nt|bobholl: luckily 2.33 just in case :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: needs a little care|pg||
nt|roswolf: you may need the 0.33:)|pg||
nt|ady: could be that declarer expecting heart length with south    |pg||
pc|d3|nt|ron_sc2002: hello|pg||
nt|panosk: i agree 2@D seems beter with this hand |pg||
nt|desinka: now...hard contract|pg||
nt|oosmanb: has 6 top tricks needs to develop 1 more|pg||
nt|skaftij:  hard to infer that East can have this hand from EW Convention card|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I think the % play is two finesses, but I confess I'm not sure|pg||
nt|hantveit: a boring wash on this one|pg||
nt|bobholl: they won't find their @D ruff for -2 i guess|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lml: but I suppose the vulnerability was a disincentive|pg||

nt|alnanda: test|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT  will be reached by n/s|pg||
nt|ady: e/w do well to play 3NT|pg||
nt|oosmanb: N might have overcalled with QJ10xx and South raised with Axx so Kxx@s also doubtful|pg||
nt|bobholl: true i wouldn't bid it too :)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|lml: David Lindop is thinking how many spades|pg||
nt|desinka: hi David|pg||
nt|ahollan1: assume DBL=4+@S  but some pairs   specify 4/5|pg||
nt|roswolf: south shows where the hcp are|pg||
nt|mdgraham: tricky hand for East - we can see that 3NT is ok, but East can't|pg||
nt|bobholl: @H 44 so 3nt makes |pg||
nt|roswolf: transfer responses for the dutch>|pg||
mb|p|nt|desinka: and Al|pg||
nt|ady: best spot appears to be 4@S n/s|pg||
nt|rnmalik: N debating between stayman or transfer. Stayman better imo.|pg||
nt|jbgood: 4@h down on the trump break - but N will save if they bid it?|pg||
nt|boedhy:  a very good lead from Brink played this game down with any other lead it will be close|pg||
nt|ady: I would think 9 or 10 tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice splinter|pg||
nt|gracelin: the opening makes it less appealling for EW to bid a slam.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=11-15 HCP, 2+@D|pg||
nt|roswolf: no|pg||
mb|1N|nt|lml: he is vulnerable ... but he decides on total tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: so just 2 imps on 2 wildish hands|pg||
nt|ady: typical Sementa opening in 3rd seat|pg||
nt|mdgraham: picture West with Jxx in spades for example|pg||
mb|p|nt|ron_sc2002: N is thinking about 4@S|pg||

nt|ady: hi Dessy|pg||
nt|star6ija: we are watching the best bulgarian pair recently...for more than 20 years they are almost non-stop part of the Bulgarian National Team in the top international forums|pg||
nt|star6ija: hi, Desita :)|pg||
nt|desinka: the best one.. but lets see the contract..|pg||

nt|lechcold: skok Martensa bezkompromisowy, ale mo¿e wepchn¹æ EW w szlemika, którego po³o¿enie wymaga..sami widzicie czego:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but splinter will help Brink declare|pg||
nt|roswolf: light but shapely opening - yes e/w will do well to score game|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H=4-fit|pg||
nt|bobholl: other room in 4@S|pg||
nt|hantveit: yes, and 5c, but 3nt more likely|pg||
nt|hantveit: shoul make 4s too|pg||
nt|hantveit: should|pg||
nt|bobholl: threy made it indeed|pg||
nt|hantveit: 3h=single H|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|ron_sc2002: 4@H is not making but in this vul it is hard for N to let it go|pg||
nt|boedhy:  for both teams still alot at stake|pg||
nt|fabsayc: should make 5 here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i am assuming he wont risk heart ruff by playing for club ruff|pg||
nt|gracelin: Leaving to their own, 6C is a reasonable contract.|pg||
nt|gracelin: but of course, not making here.|pg||
nt|roswolf: true and making 12 tricks might be iffy|pg||
nt|gracelin: this shud be easy enough and probably 11 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznv: Versace claims 12 tricks after the lead -- they are playing quick here |pg||
nt|boedhy:  Brasil strugling to get to the first 8|pg||
nt|oosmanb: South will correct to 2@H|pg||
nt|xenya: 6@D not so bad (last hand) but may be a bit tricky due to 4-1 @D|pg||
nt|runnerup: this secvense helps to let 4 @h -make easyly -south has all cards -also 3nt|pg||
nt|xenya: tempting for N to go on|pg||
nt|ady: that really should be penaly now|pg||

nt|ahollan1: well that won't work|pg||
nt|skaftij:  What a shot!|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed and it does go off but not enough perhaps|pg||
nt|gracelin: the lead maybe referred to as Canape lead.  You bid your longer suit but lead your shorter one.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: the bid worked out well|pg||
nt|ady: would have tht 3@S from north  6 card suit |pg||
nt|ahollan1: Italy off to amazing start winning 96 of possible 100 VPs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but 3@S gets raised without primary support|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: they seem to be the in form team :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: North in the tank|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so suit not good enough for 3@S|pg||
nt|ady: lack of 3@S has made it difficult to reach the best spot|pg||
nt|star6ija: Martel has to repeat the @ss|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i was wondering if Chip Martel would bid 3N instead of 3@D|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: ok ale ja skorzysta³em z okazji by co podszczypn¹æ - jak to mam (mom?) w zwyczaju|pg||
nt|oosmanb: and they'll win it there probably|pg||

mb|3N|nt|lml: north-south are too high|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 2nt 20-22|pg||
nt|ahollan1: a bit unlucky  but  Drijver expected better hand from Brink -- and certainly not @HA|pg||

nt|oosmanb: Just been given EW CC by a well informed kibitzer: ty Johan|pg||
nt|roswolf: inv raise coming|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: hi everybody|pg||
nt|ady: that mey sound like a cu  agreeing diamonds|pg||
nt|star6ija: now it is ok...repeating them immediately would have shown more solid colour|pg||
nt|kit: I don't think so -- in general, 4 of a previously bid major is offer to play I believe.|pg||
nt|ady: rather than trying to show 6 card suit not shown earlier|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: now South in the tank|pg||
nt|kit: But if Stansby is thinking, then there may be some doubt|pg||
nt|desinka: yes, agree.. but now Martel's p may think abt @ds fit..|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Kit - do you know how Martel-Stansby treat 4th suit after jump shift?|pg||
nt|star6ija: 5@s is still safe double dummy I think|pg||
nt|kit: no I don't, Al|pg||
nt|panosk: looks it wont make|pg||
nt|boedhy:  The Netherlands offcourse the higher the better because then you get to pick your opps|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Muller made 4@S on  2|pg||
nt|ady: this could be very expensive   spade lead and diamond through|pg||
mb|4S|nt|boedhy:  as we can see 4@h is close tho...|pg||
nt|boedhy:  and in natural bidding you can end in @h and with 16 opposite 8 think many will be in game...|pg||
nt|boedhy:  but a @h lead against 4@h is killing too|pg||
nt|alnanda: yes 4@h is posible altough hard way to make|pg||
nt|ady: that lead wont upset declarer    but any lead likely to be good for south  except maybe a low spade|pg||
nt|andersk: Hi Oosman, Jan:)|pg||

nt|andersk: Looks like down, even if he gets the sp right! |pg||
nt|andersk: EW only has to avoid dummy to get entry to the 3rd and 4th sp|pg||
nt|xenya: had N chosen to advance more slowly (5@C?), they might have stopped in 5 |pg||
nt|roswolf: well the usual game try|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i am not sure what a double of 4@S would have been, but maybe similar to the double of 3@c earlier, saying "i want to bid on"|pg||
nt|boedhy:  think with making 3@d is a good result|pg||
nt|ady: will be enough on best defence|pg||
nt|roswolf: now the spade switch|pg||
nt|ady: Semenra will do better not to cover the high spades|pg||
nt|ady: diamond from west  devasting   3 rounds of trumps|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes a big opportunity for china|pg||
nt|ady: could be around down 5|pg||
nt|roswolf: the bell tolls for someone|pg||

nt|ahollan1: that also gives access to BBO Voice commentary of both tables of China v Italy|pg||

nt|ahollan1: tough after 4@C to decide between science and blast|pg||
nt|bigtrain: hi|pg||
nt|hantveit: Looks like angelini got a tilt there. Boye is a good partner in thouse situations, I am sure he backs up his partner not. |pg||
nt|hantveit: now|pg||
nt|oosmanb: However they have declared that they frequently bid 3 card @H/@S after 1@c/1@D opening|pg||
mb|1S|nt|athene: i would open 2@C with east's hand for sure|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: then south might try 3@C maybe|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Hi Udo and wlc :)|pg||
nt|udo: i am at work, but will try to comment sometimes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N would be 12-14|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 2nt= 20-22|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=2+@D  a) unbal 10-15 HCP  b) Bal 11-13|pg||

mb|1N|nt|ron_sc2002: E hand is 3 loosers|pg||
nt|lml: he decided his spades were too weak for that|pg||
nt|udo: 3@D = inverted,,weak raise with good support,,quite common agreement nowadays|pg||
nt|jbgood: S contemplating some slam invite? |pg||
nt|boedhy:  guys are playing very fast :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: now 4S for EW with the ood H guess.  Will be easy if south overcalls or doubles.|pg||
nt|gracelin: good|pg||
nt|ahollan1: live video and voice commentary from onsite vugraph room http://www.wkbridge2011.com/en/live|pg||
nt|hantveit: when partner is doing something increddible bad, the best partners is backing him up, the worst are yelling.|pg||
nt|bobholl: they have a (very) good pair on the other table|pg||
nt|bobholl: 6@H a better slam than 6@S|pg||
nt|hantveit: I am not familiar with NSs system, but in natural 2D is a goo bid on souths han|pg||
nt|hantveit: if partner bids 3D, you say 3S as force, partner can insist on 4D with 4+ dia|pg||
nt|bobholl: agree completely|pg||
nt|hantveit: a@h|pg||
nt|hantveit: great, thank you, it only took me 6 years to learn that|pg||
nt|hantveit: operator, please tell them to not rush|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Sorry, the director came, Angelini had 14 cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: what bid do you like by south?|pg||
nt|barnets: needs a spade lead here to set 3N e/w|pg||
nt|pbundy: hi everyone :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this big club 1@D bid is NEVER  54 minors|pg||
mb|2S|nt|athene: 5@C perhaps|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: 4@S can go down while 4@H is always making|pg||
nt|athene: north must suspect that east has hearts, so why not give him a bit of a problem?|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: yes 5@C is a good save|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: west's pass showing some values I think|pg||
nt|lml: a matter of style|pg||
nt|athene: hello good morning everyone|pg||
nt|udo: hello|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Hi all|pg||
nt|xenya: still 2-0 -- i think it will be a record across the matches on those boards|pg||
nt|lml: I guess double makes sense with four spades and a not great club suit|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Italy-Netherlands 0-25 on the same 2 boards|pg||
nt|boedhy:  will end in 4@h making probably|pg||
nt|bt: grue and lall doing their best to give up small imps at the other table, all of us swedes are grateful|pg||
nt|bt: and hi everyone|pg||
nt|runnerup: 5 @s still good against 5 @h here -so little battle |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S=4-fit, 11-13|pg||
nt|bobholl: strange 8-11 and strange 12-14 nt :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|kemperg: hi all|pg||
nt|lechcold: tym razem 1@C Wujotowy|pg||
nt|boedhy:  plus 1 even |pg||
nt|ady: Bulgaria got 6 immps on hand 1   losing 50 in 4 diamonds   5@D doubled in OR   300|pg||
nt|ady: obvious down 1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Iceland stops in 5@S on  3|pg||
nt|ady: 6@H might fail|pg||
nt|roswolf: wow going for slam|pg||
nt|ady: would be unlucky|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Can it be 10-14 NT?|pg||
nt|oosmanb: They play multi when Vul|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: I am not crazy about 3NT even if it shows good clubs and a spade stopper|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 6 @s + 3 @h are a risk to open 2@s weak|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: you might miss the @h fit|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 3nt was not alerted|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=limit raise or better   2N=strong NT|pg||
nt|star6ija: it is maybe inverted minor and 2N showing 15-17?|pg||
nt|alnanda: there is no difficulty reaching 4@h, i think..|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: noooo Jan is catching up after the tech problems|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: These guys are good, and VERY FAST |pg||
nt|ryskiel_: najbli¿szy prawdy by³ maciej12 poda³ 45imp...wynik by³ 415-376|pg||
nt|runnerup: normal thimg to do is ofcause bid 4 @s -if they know that to be ok -and let ns deside after that -so maybe 5 @h =|pg||
nt|barnets: 3@D israel in open|pg||
nt|ady: but 3-0 heart split and needing a club ruff may be too much|pg||
nt|bobholl: luckily it was NV :)|pg||
nt|brgpro: yes that could be the reason, he could discard a @D on the 4th @h if E had any|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: even without being a convention it suggests that kind of hand|pg||
nt|xenya: more realistic|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: West dbls 3@D now, but director tells them to wait for safety|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Well, we will find ou later how 3nT was made erhaps duck a @d|pg||
nt|fabsayc: welcome Lars|pg||
nt|hantveit: so, a penalty for ew.|pg||
nt|roswolf: remember we can see ALL the cards the players only 26|pg||
pc|hA|nt|athene: south just hopes his partner doesn't do anything uncooperative, like bidding clubs :)|pg||
nt|lechcold: 1N 18-20|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3D is a spade raise- exactly what this promises varies from partnership to partnership|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: East doesn't accept|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: so bidding is as displayed, only North doesn't see it yet|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Pushed to North now|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: North has to decide the final contract now|pg||
nt|oosmanb: does 4@H need @s guess or no?|pg||
nt|skaftij:  1H showing @ss|pg||
nt|skaftij:  In OR, Wijs did not enter with @h bid on bd3, allowing Einarsson to support with 2@s iso 4@s|pg||
nt|bobholl: oh oh|pg||
nt|brgpro: assume E has only 2@d|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ron_sc2002: board 19 same play for a push|pg||
nt|lml: nice bid by south ... well done ...|pg||
nt|athene: but inverted raises tend to have both minors|pg||
nt|udo: yes. so X looks ok,,,,pass is also dangerous|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and tends to be bad hand for slam|pg||
nt|stoffers: some might bid 2@d on Duboins hand here, me included. He may regret it now when partner leads clubs|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Same lead in the OR.|pg||
nt|wild card: hi|pg||
nt|wild card: this looks like a makebale contract|pg||
nt|wild card: *makeable|pg||
nt|lml: this may work out well for Israel|pg||
nt|lml: pretty aggressive bidding by this team so far|pg||
nt|xenya: and how|pg||
nt|lml: in the OR Weinstein overcalled 2@C instead of doubling|pg||
nt|xenya: i predict some 14 imps to Israel on this one|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: MArtel has found a book|pg||
nt|lml: its a style thing but the club suit looks pretty weak to me|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and has started reading in it|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Director call|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: West didn't pass, but the tray wa spushed to the North side already|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and North bid already and SW saw it when the tray was pulled back|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Director walked away, i Didn't hear his ruling..|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Tray is at WestSouth side now|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Think director went to get some help|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 2nd director here: they said it's more complicated|pg||
nt|jbgood: in the meantime i go for a coffee|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Norths 3@S is treated is as a bid of turn|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: without screens|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: East can accept 3@S or let the tray go back to Fredin|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: East asking what the total consequences ar|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: if west passes, north bids 3@s and auction proceeds as normal|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: if west doesn't pass, then if north bid @S's (at any lvl) south has to pass 1 round|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: If west doesn't pass and North bids something else than @S south should pass the rest of the auction|pg||
nt|andersk: interesting 4@H here|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: same here :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: china lost 3 imps on bd17 2@S-1 by the chinese south in the other room|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer is unlikely to misguess H position now.|pg||
nt|gracelin: south also has a tough lead.  3 Aces and a singleton trump, all unappealling|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it is either balanced  or   5minor 4Major|pg||
pc|h9|nt|athene: 4@C isn't giving east any problem|pg||
nt|lml: he liked the stiff spade and the club fit|pg||
nt|lml: so will south cuebid the @HK?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S=shortness|pg||
nt|boedhy:  so were back now..|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: And we are back live now|pg||
nt|boedhy:  and first imps for iceland|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Board 18 was a 4@c down 2 in N|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: well done Jan and thanks|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and a 4@s making on board 19|pg||
nt|boedhy:  yes well done Jan|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Now we are LIVE again - and 2nt showed a 3 or 4 card @s support|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: nice to see some totally natural bidding :)|pg||
nt|xenya: so Sweden are off to a flying start in this match -- very important for them  as they are currently 9th, closely followed by Australia and Japan |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Ashley in the tank now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but Muller did bid @H:)|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  5 @s is not easy to make without a @c lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes bidding defensive does have downsides too|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer needs to use his high trump to play the red suit.  Club can be led from either hand.  So better win and start a red suit.|pg||
nt|hantveit: why not 3!AH |pg||
nt|bobholl: the  1nt is just to play opposite 8-11 so not well defined|pg||
nt|oosmanb: CC says Nonvul TP if pd passed|pg||
nt|oosmanb: So he wants to play 1NT. thats it.|pg||
nt|bobholl: he 'd better lead a @H otherwise made |pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|boedhy:  think this will go down so 8 imps or so to iceland|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: and thanks 350 specs for hanging in there with us :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: a great start for the "hometeam" |pg||
nt|boedhy:  yes and an important match it is. |pg||
nt|jbennet: An x with void hearts dangerous.|pg||
nt|pbundy: a possibility that the extreme trump break may give declarer a problem here - IF they do indeed declare in 3@H|pg||
nt|hantveit: 3 aIh|pg||
nt|hantveit: see, I lost it again|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3@H would have been much better|pg||
nt|hantveit: 3a@h|pg||
nt|bobholl: indeed|pg||
pc|h4|nt|star6ija: Trendafilov will attack hearts now|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: he is asking questions at moment|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW lead 2nd/4th against suit and nt     upside down signals focusing on count|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: so we have to wait and see|pg||
nt|ady: diamonds 3-2  and hearts 4-4   this should roll home|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Lets say, @D to the Ace, small @D ruff, small @S to the Ace and another @D ruff, @S to J and @D ruff and @SK. Do we get to 10 tricks?|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: I cant see the title of it|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: South annoyed|pg||
nt|boedhy:  there is.....|pg||
nt|boedhy:  strange bidding form south 2@c round forcing|pg||
nt|hantveit: I am slow, but I think I got it now|pg||
nt|hantveit: @C|pg||
pc|h5|nt|vugraphznv: bulgaria scored 10 on the slam hand|pg||
nt|jbgood: he would rather have seen a redouble:)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: South to toilet now|pg||
nt|bt: thanks martin|pg||
nt|hlortz: hello Lars yes sweden has picked up a few so far|pg||
nt|xenya: 8 teams qualify for the quarterfinals -- and this is the last round|pg||
nt|ahollan1: similiar situation here|pg||
nt|kit: scary stop when vul 3NT is so close.|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: after Levin put the cards down...North said YOU HAVE SOMETHING :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: true|pg||
nt|ady: have stayed out    have done well   may get a swing|pg||
nt|ady: 6@H  well with the odds|pg||
nt|gracelin: when north can only contribute S6 on first trick, south shud know declarer's trumps are all high.|pg||
nt|grebrof: maybe Angelini sponsored them as well|pg||
pc|h7|nt|odysseus69: here the KJ of clubs are waste paper- |pg||
nt|boedhy:  if you end up 4th you will get the best team form 5-8 as opponent for instance USA1|pg||
nt|bt: so on the pedestrian heart lead decl has 8 tricks, now he has 9|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: another potential good board for sweden|pg||
nt|runnerup: this cant be bad for Sweden either|pg||
nt|barnets: exact same bidding in open room|pg||
nt|bobholl: sry not made but you never can tell|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Is @H lead really findable?|pg||
pc|hK|pg||

nt|andersk: @C lead, then If he hooks a @D switch for -1|pg||
nt|oosmanb: interesting on a @c lead|pg||
nt|andersk: maybe cullin leads @H|pg||
nt|xenya: that's right |pg||
nt|gracelin: thoug declarer has only 3 obvious loser, he might not have 10 trick since he cannt ruff the 4th D.  North will overruff.|pg||
nt|jbennet: but 3 sP is a choice|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: i would have overcalled 1@H with the north hand but pass is ok if your partner is there for you with a double|pg||
nt|kemperg: the only lossing line?|pg||
nt|wild card: yes|pg||
nt|wild card: but now he's down|pg||
nt|jbennet: which is the one recommended.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|stoffers: no problem...sementa found a @d nomather what :)|pg||
nt|antoniz: witam serdecznie|pg||
nt|lechcold: 4@H wychodzi...obrona mo¿e jedynie utrudniæ puszczaj¹c karo|pg||
nt|lechcold: witam|pg||
nt|lechcold: z uwagi na ograniczon¹ liczbê dojæ do sto³u, trzeba jednak rozegraæ bardzo trafnie|pg||
nt|garden2005: czesc Antoni|pg||
nt|lechcold: no nie wiem czy taki zadowolony:)|pg||
nt|ady: could make if hearts with south    9 tricks available    but defence have 5|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: they are very friendly at the table|pg||
nt|oosmanb: can switch though, to kill dummy's entry, THAT is findable|pg||
nt|bobholl: but does he suspect a@s single |pg||
nt|oosmanb: Can be pretty certain since with dblton he mightve run from dbl?|pg||
nt|oosmanb: however |pg||
nt|oosmanb: what if pd has AJxx|pg||
nt|oosmanb: @D|pg||
nt|bobholl: he can have that off course :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: but a @D a@H and 7 @S = C|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|lml: wow ... well done north south|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or was it USA lost 10|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: lol|pg||
nt|yuval10: if you say the name it'd probably turn into a best-seller in a moment :)|pg||
nt|bt: grue had a brain melt in 6@C doubled and lall gave up a second spade finesse, thanks|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: sorry - zwyciêzc¹ konkursu by³ marian 12 anie maciej12|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|andersk: no chanse to set now|pg||
nt|oosmanb: ? If pd had J@D along with A. then top 4@D and 2@C tricks?|pg||
nt|bobholl: south took a profitable gamble :)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: switch K@H and J@d|pg||
pc|sA|nt|alnanda: i think 2@c is drury|pg||
nt|bobholl: may be 2@H only showed a minimum but it's strange anyway|pg||
nt|hantveit: yes, but it is hard when we do not know the system. But they should be able to find a 4-4 fit in @H|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Angelini found the 13th card on the floor from last game, maybe that is why he threw away the clubs|pg||
nt|oosmanb: although that doesnt even leave 8-11 with East|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ron_sc2002: agree.. partner probably wont bid again so better to make pressure on E and bid directly 5@C|pg||
nt|fabsayc: on heart lead he makes also|pg||
pc|s4|nt|lml: would all of you have got to 6@C?|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: tricky too bid|pg||
nt|lml: it sure is|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: now the live scores is down so hope we get that back soon|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm should be made ok i think|pg||
nt|gracelin: srry, I a, wrong.  Declarer does have 10 tricks.  He can pitach the 4th D on a good club|pg||
nt|mdgraham: rehi sry lost connx|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Best lead is @d probably|pg||

nt|ahollan1: on 18  other table 5@C going down  so 11 for Sweden|pg||
pc|d2|nt|xenya: in 10 minutes or so he will be brought back to cruel reality|pg||
nt|lml: south asked for a heart earlier|pg||
nt|boedhy:  ah trying to make it...|pg||
nt|pbundy: no useful pitch - and a ruff high appears to doom the contract also|pg||
nt|pbundy: not to mention some clubs which must be disposed of......|pg||
nt|jbennet: a narrow escape. for -1. |pg||
pc|d8|nt|lml: with the high spade|pg||
nt|yuval10: he saw KJ@d KQ@s in N, K@h can't be with him as well|pg||
pc|dT|nt|athene: north might have intended 4@C to say "you can save in 5@C if you like"|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: some more imps coming up for sweden|pg||
nt|runnerup: looks like another 10 |pg||
nt|hantveit: It must be the @c ace|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|lml: an established partnership like the Herbst have it easier because they know what to expect from each other|pg||
pc|c4|nt|boedhy:  well their is the advatage of being known as a good player......|pg||
pc|c2|nt|rnmalik: played on @S and @H 3/2. |pg||

nt|ahollan1: deWijs may open west hand 1N  [or PASS]|pg||

nt|lml: 12 well deserved imps to give Israel the lead|pg||
nt|kamyk: gdyby @CA sta³...|pg||
nt|jbennet: he might deduce south having 2623 from start|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  19  [4@HN=]   Fallenius in 2@H|pg||
nt|jbennet: that couldnt have been s surprise.|pg||
nt|pbundy: had he known the layout, a club pitch might have been more opportune|pg||
nt|ahollan1: strongly recommend    buckle up   this will be a bumpy set of boards|pg||
nt|jbennet: the hearts were huge huge favourite to be 4-0.|pg||
nt|hantveit: then it makes more sence, but he must have lost if after the opening...|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lml: yes it does but Stansby doesnt know that yet|pg||
nt|boedhy:  but Campos now kowes never to trust Brink anymore|pg||
pc|d3|nt|vugraphznv: he did not ruff yet|pg||
nt|jbennet: but on the other hand there is no way to deep finesse in D lacking 1 entry.|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dK|pg||
nt|lml: he is about to find out though :)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ady: smalltrue  there was a defence   smalll club at trick 2  possible but difficult|pg||
nt|boedhy:  something i could have told him on beforehand|pg||
pc|c5|nt|jbennet: in fact it was 99 % sure that hearts were 4-0.|pg||
nt|jbennet: if not then east only possible distributon were 4324|pg||
pc|c9|nt|vugraphznv: claiming losing a @s and a @H|pg||
nt|panosk: what a struggle for a mere 2@S part score|pg||
nt|panosk: 2@H sorry|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: if he makes it lose 2 imps goes it down 7 imps|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|jbennet: and no sane player would sit for 3 h x with 4-c support in clubs and only xxx in hearts.|pg||

nt|bobholl: nice position @D K :)|pg||

nt|kerasidis: hi all|pg||
nt|anton72: i guess ...both M |pg||
nt|mdgraham: in which case, North may have meant 2@S as a (case a) transfer-accept of hearts (b) well, don't know really|pg||
nt|anton72: no way to ending in 2 @s if partner know 5+ @h i think|pg||
nt|anton72: or may be you are right ...good accept for hearts ...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: semi-force|pg||
nt|pbundy: a bit surprised that east did not show a 2 suiter here - particularly given the colors|pg||
nt|brgpro: if Versace doubles, they would be in game...so |pg||
nt|roswolf: the clubs must be orange flavoured here|pg||
nt|brgpro: 3NT or 4@H, Lauria is considering...but never 3@H i believe|pg||
nt|roswolf: fair comment jack|pg||
nt|brgpro: pass?|pg||
nt|bobholl: may be even pass :)|pg||
nt|ady: 3@C looks down 1 on a spade lead    bu East might be more ambitious|pg||
nt|brgpro: that is a big decision...although that is the winning one perhaps|pg||
nt|roswolf: now pass frightens me|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: in the Open Room they did start with a weak 2 using multi ... that may have made it a bit harder|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @S were 3/2, you mean @Hs.|pg||
nt|boedhy:  3crd support|pg||
nt|oosmanb: moderately straight forward hands so far, and almost all the tables playing v fast|pg||
nt|barnets: Israel bid to 5@C here with little values 20 hcp e/w|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 20:20 both sides and partial.|pg||
nt|anton72: anyway sweden can get a big gain here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and it looks lie 4@h has a good play on this lie, but I don't think they'll get there|pg||
nt|pbundy: double now?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't know the 2@C rebid :(|pg||
nt|bobholl: never pretty in comparisations doubled partscore made :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: im sorry, north wasnt thinking. Just forgot to pass for him:)|pg||
nt|ady: might try 3NT    that  should come unstuck|pg||
nt|roswolf: would perhaps put off breakfast for the vampires |pg||
nt|brgpro: we knew that|pg||

nt|brolucius: 2@S shows a sound heart raise.|pg||
nt|brolucius: The double shows some spade support (or a doubleton honor) but denies the values to bid 3@S.|pg||
nt|hlortz: and theres always the guilty pleasure in seeing others go wrong - gives us hope :)|pg||
nt|bt: now fallenius should get diamonds in there to involve partner|pg||
nt|brolucius: Indeed.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 4@D now?|pg||
nt|brolucius: North has a great fit for both red suits, as you see.|pg||
nt|bt: luckily for sweden fallenius would normally, only god knows what fredin would do with that hand|pg||
nt|bt: not even god actually|pg||
nt|bt: fredin has a great mind but for us mortals its hard to understand|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: if they bid this slam i will say again..woooow|pg||
nt|jbennet: 3h probably some sort of semi fit in spades. a hand unsuitable to rebid 2 NT.|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 25hcp|pg||
nt|runnerup: 5 @d better than 4 @s -if you loose  one @d|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C = good raise of @H|pg||
nt|xenya: will they get to 4? I'm not sure|pg||
nt|ahollan1: many pairs use 1N as the "cue"|pg||
nt|kit: Very aggressively bid to 5@C in other room -- might make, might not.|pg||

nt|roswolf: transfer|pg||
nt|gracelin: 1S shows D|pg||

nt|roswolf: not much on for n/s|pg||

nt|roswolf: 4@s MAY BE ANOTHER SPOT NOW|pg||
nt|roswolf: if rdbl showed Hx in spades|pg||
nt|ady: some play that re-dbl showing at least doubleton honor in spades   others play good general values|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 2@c not alerted on both sides|pg||

nt|mdgraham: I'll get the CC from the ecats site and see if I can found out - give 5 mins|pg||
nt|anton72: 1 imp in the air ....|pg||
nt|anton72: but what ..1 by 1 ....|pg||
nt|oosmanb: some play rdbl there as Hx in @H|pg||
nt|oosmanb: But if 1@h could be 4 cards, rdbl as support looks good|pg||
nt|nkgupt: he sure knows when to underbid :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: great lead now find the @D ruff|pg||
nt|roswolf: these guys may do strange looking things but they usually result in positive imp results|pg||
nt|brgpro: with this lead, 3@h is not the winning one but pass|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ady: likely 11 tricks with nice lay of diamonds and spade split|pg||
nt|stoffers: Einarson with a huge hand after whats shown here, i would rather bid 3@s than 3@d|pg||
nt|ady: noticed Zack 's 3@D     presumeable at that point weaker than pass?|pg||
nt|boedhy:  can he read the 5 he should|pg||
nt|jbennet: west will rule out 3NT as a playable spot. |pg||
nt|xenya: with NS silent. bidding this slam would have been a real feat|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Ola Rimstedt let me know that in the open room they play 6d|pg||
nt|runnerup: if you dont loose any @d -you make 6 -but here -important to loose no @d -whenr you are short of trumps also |pg||
nt|xenya: i wonder how many tables will reach it -- not too many i think|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: so may be the kiwis can take some badly needed imps back|pg||
nt|szalay: cheap and effective|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Johnsson helping NS get back into game exploration|pg||
nt|szalay: 3@C-3@H-4@H?|pg||
nt|bobholl: ns still don't know the bad @S|pg||
nt|kit: East opened the bidding there -- here, they won't get so high.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: a common approach in "Brit 1@c" is for 2@c by South to show the majors and 2@d to show one major |pg||
nt|jbennet: but in view of souths 3 cl bid.|pg||
nt|grebrof: 2nt now from Boye I guess|pg||

nt|runnerup: there is a way to put a @d loose away so take care of @h by dummys trumps -but now -after @c lead there is no way to go down |pg||
nt|xenya: now, of course, EW may find a save in @C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but @S only 3 losers    and  that's ok in 4@H|pg||
nt|skaftij:  costs 500|pg||
nt|gracelin: when opponents play these transfer responses, one shud take advantage of that.|pg||
nt|bobholl: west again with 2 nt ? secondary @D |pg||
nt|bobholl: don't like to double with no @H|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: zreszt¹ jak oceni³ Gawry kontrê Kality to ja wiem ale nie powiem|pg||
nt|boedhy:  for a quick 1 off..|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well we knew this was coming, if i bid 4@H my intent is to pull any doubles|pg||
nt|bt: i think fallenius could have done better here|pg||
nt|barnets: a spade was led against 5@C that gives 4 spade tricks and dec only needs 2 @D ruffs|pg||
nt|barnets: so will make for sure|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Levin explaing : 3c is his worst hand :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: explaining|pg||
nt|brolucius: Hi to the kibitzers!|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, some play that pass is weaker than 3@C.|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2@D showed a sound raise to at least 3@C. 3@C instead would have been pre-emptive.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or  just thought too good for 2@S :)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lml: needing a club finesse you really dont want to be in the grand but ...|pg||
nt|ady: nice cheap trick to begin|pg||
nt|rnmalik: yet to see a routine game hand:)|pg||
nt|jbgood: so no double - and a small win for Sweden|pg||
nt|panosk: club ruff if in diamonds that is|pg||
nt|ady: e/w taken the non vul save|pg||
nt|boedhy:  yeah|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: you were right :)|pg||
nt|bt: you have to make your mind up if you want to involve partner or do guesswork, sometimes informative bids helps opponents also|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice bid showing @D help|pg||
nt|skaftij:  3@d suits brink|pg||
nt|szalay: no more time to bid it|pg||
nt|roswolf: agreed|pg||
pc|h5|nt|xenya: Martel's pass shows equal length in the majors |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: and 3@H got it in the OR|pg||
nt|skaftij:  in OR, North doubled 5@d and South pulled to 5 @H|pg||
nt|skaftij:  That went to East wko bid the par contract, 6@d|pg||
nt|skaftij:  North then bid 6@h, certainly reasonable |pg||
nt|jbennet: 2 clubs more likely to an improvised call (not willing to rebid AQ-nano-sixth.)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|antoniz: sk¹d znam ten tekst?|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: z autopsji Antoni z autopsji:)|pg||
nt|antoniz: :):)|pg||
nt|ady: notice 3nt slipped through in OR|pg||
nt|panosk: gd call|pg||
nt|ady: on that lead making 200 anyway|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes|pg||
nt|ady: 5@H   just making  flat     tht Italiaans may well have been in 6|pg||
nt|roswolf: declarer might not believe the even spade break|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|panosk: 7 imps to Sweeden|pg||
nt|oosmanb: switch to @D probably, looks like only chance |pg||
pc|s6|nt|lml: so south knows they are off the @CQ from the keycard response|pg||
nt|udo: @D discard?|pg||
nt|lml: this looks like at least a small pickup for USA|pg||
nt|szalay: wd|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but i think @CA undisclosed   Brink gets to game, but maybe Drijver should have bid it|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
nt|jbennet: and indeed it worked fine, |pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't recall if i mentioned    both pairs  upside-down count & attitude|pg||
nt|jbennet: enabling NS to figure out the good fit.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: indeed it worked out very well   i particular like the way the auction put @SK in West hand|pg||
nt|pbundy: although it may not be 100% certain to grue that the club 2 is a singleton|pg||
nt|hantveit: angelini did not dear say 3D|pg||
nt|bobholl: brave :)|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|stoffers: But, bad splits and game not making today- quite lucky for him|pg||
nt|ady: best defence down 3   but 4@H should make|pg||
pc|sA|nt|bt: 4@D is good if its your contract and gets partner involved, it was on this hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: can someone please give me the running scores link|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Drijver hand did NOT have to be this pure|pg||
nt|bobholl: they stopped just in time |pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|athene: as expected, bocchi bid 5@C and reaped a large reward|pg||
nt|hantveit: agree, I do not like to double with void either. 2nt showing 6 clubs an 4d would be my choice|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lml: the canadians were a bit lucky|pg||
nt|lml: 6NT by north can go down if the spade and clubs are offside|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Likely ruff and would bank on @D finesse, whick is correct.|pg||
nt|ady: in fact sorry this is down 2|pg||
nt|ady: e/w have the club pips to restrick to 1 loser|pg||
nt|bobholl: on a @S switch they only make 3 now 4 i guess|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|lml: from south 6@C is better |pg||
nt|lml: with the @SQ protected|pg||
nt|odysseus69: North had a chance to double 2C but resisted - |pg||
nt|xenya: -1 on the lead?|pg||
nt|boedhy:  think 3@s will make also|pg||
nt|brolucius: I have only just come back from a week-end away, so I don't even know which teams qualified.|pg||
nt|barnets: in 5@C dec takes care of his 3 diamond losers by ruffing 2 and pitching one on the long spade|pg||
nt|barnets: after a spade lead|pg||

nt|ady: down 1 in 3|pg||
nt|brgpro: 2|pg||
pc|cA|nt|rnmalik: wd.|pg||
nt|ady: no take out double in OR   and 2@C response from west   system bid  I would think   then eventually 3NT    low spade lead|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: indeed me too another 7|pg||
nt|hantveit: angelini woke up now, and this might be the advantage with boyes double. He has points. 2nt is more defensive|pg||
pc|c8|nt|athene: if he plays a trump now, the roof comes in; south just draws trumps|pg||
nt|lechcold: tak czy siak -12|pg||
nt|roswolf: now he will|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ron_sc2002: and the defence made the same to beat 5@H|pg||
nt|ady: however entries are scarce  so still may be down 3|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|jbgood: N showing confidence in prd's discards|pg||
nt|bobholl: K of @D getting count now ?|pg||
nt|hantveit: looks like -2 |pg||
nt|hantveit: can just play 3 times @d|pg||
nt|hantveit: dia A, partner ask for more dia|pg||
nt|bobholl: may be only -1 (KQ@C take care of @S|pg||
nt|hantveit: east must hold xx in clubs after the 3 club bid|pg||
nt|hantveit: I do not think it is enough time bob, east might ruff the third club with a low heart|pg||
pc|s4|nt|lml: as the cards lie of course nothing can hurt a grand|pg||
nt|jbennet: think west is thinking of guarding agaist sp 5-1. (if they were then winning the lead in dummy had been fatal).|pg||
nt|pbundy: he simply may not have wished to lead away from AQ in hearts or the like|pg||
nt|oosmanb: friendly layout|pg||
pc|sT|nt|athene: but roofs coming in hurt less when it's just 50s :)|pg||
nt|garden2005: ka¿dy pisze i myli to co mu siê wydaje, analizy musz¹ byæ szybkie ... mo¿na czasem sie pomyliæ :) nie upieram siê, ze mam racjê|pg||
nt|lml: I think so|pg||
nt|bobholl: 5 even|pg||
pc|s2|nt|gracelin: the Chinese NS in closed room is playing Precision.  South will start with a strong club and north maybe game minded.|pg||
nt|ady: down 2|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|udo: should be only 1 more trick for versace|pg||
nt|ady: setting up a 3rd diamond trick in case spades break badly|pg||
nt|ady: if east eventually enters with 3rd round of spades to west hand and runs J@C   south can win and playQ@d  sett up the 10  but no good to east who has 4 clubs|pg||
nt|bobholl: but will angelini find the @S shift (he should off course)|pg||
nt|hantveit: east will surely play spade first time he can|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: I think odd is encouraging|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lechcold: ja te¿:)|pg||
nt|ady: sorry there was a take-out dbl|pg||
nt|roswolf: this cardplay in defence is of the highest order|pg||
nt|ady: still gain|pg||

nt|jkotor: cos szkodzi grac atu na oddanie waleta?|pg||
nt|jkotor: sorry, priv|pg||
nt|lml: unless somehow Stansby can engineer an endplay on south|pg||
nt|xenya: the defence might slip though|pg||
nt|boedhy:  so 2 imps for the netherlands|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: no well still OK for NL|pg||
nt|bobholl: or 3 sry|pg||
nt|oosmanb: :)|pg||
nt|oosmanb: cant finesse|pg||
nt|oosmanb: unless he thinks K@D off and Q@S on |pg||
nt|oosmanb: nice defence to put declarer on the spot|pg||
nt|bobholl: if the @S Q and @D K are interchanged :)|pg||

nt|ryskiel_: ale roznie zapiszê bo ciekawe|pg||
nt|odysseus69: yes South doubled 1D in OR- even you and I would have doubled David - old and conservative as we are|pg||
nt|ady: lol|pg||
nt|lml: Stansby took a reasonable shot single dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Ginossar asks if its possible to play a little faster|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: almost played one hour and only 5 boards completed|pg||
nt|boedhy:  and with 5@c going down good result i think for the Netherlands|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Last night I spoke with the icelandic pair in this room for some time|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: they had a testmatch some time ago against the Netherlands|pg||
nt|boedhy:  and did they tell anything interesting..|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and was beaten quiet heavily|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: another fast one|pg||
nt|andersk: maybe the will get an early dinner today:)|pg||
nt|bt: i get lots of messages but i cant comment on all, but i try :-)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: any rubber bridge players out there??|pg||
nt|gracelin: EW play 15+ - 18 1NT|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: :)|pg||
nt|hantveit: a very good result for east west here. bringing some confidence back to angelini.|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: score remains on board 3|pg||
nt|bobholl: wow indeed nice defence|pg||
nt|roswolf: our first slam hand|pg||
nt|brgpro: finally a 6|pg||
nt|ady: slam in either major|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: well, north threw a trick, yes|pg||
nt|athene: he could have kept @DJ and the heart winner|pg||
nt|famus: Hi all|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: rozdanie of course|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=14-16|pg||
nt|barnets: dec lost a spade ruff |pg||
nt|gracelin: Guess this East hand qualify for good 15|pg||
nt|pbundy: someone asked me on the last hand if i would have bid vul with east's hand:  no!  but at these colors, i would have entered|pg||
nt|hantveit: a 21/19 fight these hands are more important then many believes|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: if south had ventured 2nt over 2@H that might have pushed EW into 3@H-1, but it was a bit hard with a 3 count|pg||
nt|antoniz: wietne szkoleniowo|pg||
nt|ady: problem for north  if he does double 2@C   then they will reach the making game|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 6D doomed but where will this end?|pg||
nt|barnets: in 5@C|pg||
nt|bobholl: 1 or 4@H ?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ron_sc2002: 2NT maybe is a fit-inv|pg||
nt|athene: bocchi overcalled 1@H as expected|pg||
nt|athene: on  20|pg||
nt|athene: and got @SA, spade lead, which made it easy|pg||
nt|athene: spade ruff threatened so he just bashed out ace and a trump|pg||
nt|famus: the last bd created a swing bcoz Rashid chose to lead @SA--a @D lead wud've given Bocchi losing options|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: I put in the bidding 2 and 2 // and at the moment it is Lauria thinking over 4@s from N|pg||
nt|ady: possible to get overboard   but 6@D should fail|pg||
nt|brolucius: Well, I was disconnected and missed that competitive auction. I will look at it via the MOVIE button.|pg||
nt|barnets: he had it made by not finessing clubs|pg||
nt|barnets: but took club finesse and lost a ruff|pg||
nt|yusufb: oda bole hareretlimi|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=14-16|pg||
nt|hantveit: 10 tricks in minor as the dia are behaving|pg||
nt|bobholl: or namyats :)|pg||
nt|brgpro: how expensive is 7@d?|pg||
mb|3D|nt|udo: 2NT transfer @C ?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: transfer to @C.|pg||
nt|roswolf: well then 1nt is obvious:)|pg||
nt|anton72: good sacriface from OR by England ladies|pg||
nt|bobholl: don't know their range but seems a bit strong to me|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: I think the explanation is @C or @H, but not sure|pg||
nt|bobholl: who is saving against whom ??|pg||
nt|brgpro: 1400...|pg||
nt|brgpro: almost the same|pg||
nt|roswolf: doesnt look too difficult to reach although the @D barrage may confuse things|pg||
mb|4D|nt|lml: I would call the north hand a mixed raise ... 2@D suggests a limit raise to me|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 2nt = @h fit|pg||
nt|udo: looks like:)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: invitational values|pg||
nt|udo: thx|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: explained from Versace to Masood|pg||
nt|ady: around 1NT  loooks likely|pg||
nt|wild card: what's the range of 1NT?|pg||
nt|lechcold: wejcie hmhmhm...graniczne:)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: some play that 4D =D and H|pg||
nt|brolucius: I see that Fallenius failed to take Lars' advice and show his second suit - paying the price.|pg||
nt|skaftij:  2@c = majors|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=@H & @S|pg||
nt|brolucius: East knows of only 8 trumps between the hands, but may take the push to3@H on a 5-5 hand. |pg||
nt|roswolf: 5@D looks a likely spot|pg||
nt|roswolf: if east bids of course|pg||
nt|bobholl: 5@C would be great now|pg||
mb|5D|nt|athene: yes, uncontested 1@H-2NT is limit with 3 or 4 cards; clearly a raise here too|pg||
nt|lml: its pretty close between the two choices|pg||
nt|famus: Hello Udo & William|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS 1N=12-14 EXCEPT  3rd seat vul = 15-17|pg||
nt|wild card: thx|pg||
nt|odysseus69: but not here|pg||
nt|odysseus69: North said "content"|pg||
nt|anton72: 5 @d is cool .....even 6 could me made without @h lead and right guessing @c|pg||
nt|roswolf: alot of folks wanted south to bid 6@D|pg||
mb|6S|nt|lml: more spades from west|pg||
nt|lml: a lot more it appears|pg||
nt|athene: hi|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Hello all|pg||
nt|stoffers: Rising with King best now|pg||
nt|stoffers: Hi there Denmark :)|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Sort of :-)|pg||
nt|ady: off beat pre-empt has caused havoc|pg||
nt|runnerup: here also a nt game sits|pg||
nt|bobholl: poor n will have to bid 3@H|pg||
nt|oosmanb: good question :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: no ok   north likely considered his hand to flat to look for anythin more than game|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 1nt opening is 14-16|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: but maybe N didnt like his distribution 3343|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and just bid 3nt|pg||
nt|kit: is this just club values or a game try?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Game try, I suppose.|pg||
nt|ady: 5@C  a make     5@S   a save non vul against vul|pg||
nt|ady: or 5@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: some use 2@d from south to say no pref|pg||
nt|oosmanb: 10 tricks in 4@H for EW but importantly cant make 5@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|ron_sc2002: Pass is clearly forcing in this situation|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: E with 6-5 will bid again|pg||
nt|ady: I meant for n/s   but e/w got there first|pg||
nt|boedhy:  And in that board we see the other site of Brink bidding a daring 5@c drove the opps to high|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: they are a very good pair never the less|pg||
nt|boedhy:  they are pleased with the way there are playing in the tournament so far ...|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: so the Iceland team knew this would be a VERY VERY difficult match|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: why not 3@C instead of 2@H|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: = and so far they were absolutely right|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Skaftij types faster|pg||
nt|kit: Either way, West has easy 3@H call.|pg||
nt|hantveit: can they double again?|pg||
nt|bobholl: so 4@S is automatic over 4@H at this vulnarabilty|pg||
nt|bobholl: now sjoert wanted he had bid 5@C|pg||
mb|7D|nt|ron_sc2002: @S's are not breaking so it will go down|pg||
nt|athene: 5@C one down assuming they cash out correctly, but it's hard to get these hands perfectly right|pg||
nt|athene: east didn't think he had any defence at all so 5@H was not unreasonable|pg||
nt|athene: he didn't expect to be cashing two heart tricks against 5@C on this auction|pg||
nt|udo: diificult set of hands so far,,,,,,,,cold 6 @S diif to bid earlier,,,here 6@H on @C finesse|pg||
nt|odysseus69: next door North expressed his happiness|pg||
nt|ady: yes|pg||
nt|jbgood: even 2 down after perfect defense (2 club ruffs) will lose an imp for Sweden|pg||
nt|bt: well commentators all of us suggested @D bids, but he is the one playing the world championships so ...|pg||
nt|andyv:  1     ITALY  3582   NETHERLANDS 342    USA 2 3424   ISRAEL 314.35   USA 1 310.56   ICELAND 308.57   NEW ZEALAND 2998   CHINA 295.5|pg||
nt|brolucius: Swap West's black suits, so his K-Q were assisting partner's help-suit, and he might have gone to 4@H.|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Levin said 3c was game try... and said I havent seen you rejecting a game try in 3 years loool|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer has limited dummy entries -- but if South leads a club that will make his life easier.|pg||
nt|gracelin: maybe due to the 5-card major.  Some still reject to open 1NT with a good 5-card M|pg||
mb|d|nt|famus: has to sac|pg||
nt|athene: versace's pass over 5@S clearly encouraging his partner to bid on|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: N has bid 6@s|pg||
nt|udo: sacrifice is successfull, but not so clear for me|pg||
nt|famus: EW different league--to say the least!|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and now Lauria thinking again|pg||
nt|udo: if he bids 6 @S,,wd|pg||
nt|star6ija: complicate decision for Martel|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Aronov will open 1N and Stefanov will bid  so  nobody stopping in 1N|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: looks like..he is thinking|pg||
nt|ady: 2@D down 1    but difficulty for north to do anything|pg||
nt|star6ija: no...Stefanov will pass|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Kit -- does DBL now show 2@D?|pg||

nt|ady: 14-16 no-trump I am told so even more reason for north to just go to game|pg||
nt|brolucius: Always a good idea to bid NT as soon as possible with a balanced hand. Here North rebids 1NT to show 11-14.|pg||
nt|xenya: this looks like a normal 3N|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Weinstein: i almost bid it|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes but an ok spot has been reached|pg||
nt|anton72: verry pesimistic bidd here by E-W|pg||
nt|bobholl: s didn't double 2nt so pass quickly|pg||
mb|p|nt|andersk: this should be another fast board for makeing maximum partscoore|pg||
nt|hlortz: good result ew in OR here |pg||
nt|xenya: EW in trouble now|pg||
mb|p|nt|star6ija: I expected this bid|pg||
nt|xenya: a club lead beats 4@S...|pg||
nt|lml: I am going to guess that this hand wont be played that quickly|pg||
nt|fabsayc: when opponents have the ranking suit, show your second suit, when they dont is less important|pg||
nt|roswolf: nice brings both minors into the picture|pg||
nt|hantveit: yes, if he bids 4, I think boye will double|pg||
nt|bobholl: boy will have to choose ruff's or lead @C|pg||
nt|ady: 7@D  gains an imp|pg||
mb|p|nt|skaftij:  Only lived in Denmark last 31 years, being an Icelander|pg||
nt|boedhy:  well i think you want to be in 4@h with such strong @h|pg||
nt|skaftij:  a lot of bidding by EW, but this will make|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N scramble?   i.e. no preference|pg||
nt|szalay: sure|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 20  [3@HX]    Fredin 4@H undoubled|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: bertheau looking at lall and the X as if he is asking if it asks for a special lead|pg||
nt|pbundy: not sure where west could consider running - if indeed that's going through his mind|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Lall saying no|pg||
nt|hantveit: club to ace, club 4 to king and dia ?|pg||
nt|brgpro: 1 imps is an imp...|pg||
nt|nkgupt: 1imp save:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: 7@D is a bit OTT|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ady: 3 clubs a possibilty   but not obvious for north with small values|pg||
nt|lml: North-south can set up a diamond for a club pitch now|pg||
nt|xenya: but naturally enough, a @D has been lead|pg||
nt|lml: Just to make it clear to a few who asked.  On a club lead you win the club and you cant set up diamonds fast enough|pg||
nt|lml: east-west keep leading clubs and will set up a trick before you can get a diamond discard going|pg||
nt|lml: on any other lead north-south can play diamonds first|pg||
nt|boedhy:  @s lead|pg||
nt|boedhy:  will make this |pg||
nt|boedhy:  the @h are also helpfull in 3nt offcourse|pg||
nt|boedhy:  1@s 4@h 2 in each minor|pg||
nt|runnerup: little under point -but makes like it is -something to play and bid|pg||
nt|brolucius: Oh yes, with 11 losers and x-x-x in the help suit?|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: all laughing|pg||
nt|kit: I think declarer will use his one and only dummy entry for a club finesse.  That works, but he will have to lose 3 trump tricks for down 1.|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: South thinking|pg||
nt|barnets: so you think it is right to give up on making the contract kit ?|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: cards on the table|pg||
nt|kit: South has a problem here -- he can't be sure his partner has only 3 spades, unless they always bid higher with 4.|pg||
nt|barnets: rather than try to make it|pg||
nt|kit: why does that give up?  Can't somebody have Ax of hearts?|pg||
nt|barnets: yes Ax hearts is good enough|pg||
nt|anton72: i think W can continued with DBL over 2 @h|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if you are unfamiliar with screens    NE are on one side and SW on the other side of the divider|pg||
nt|ahollan1: all questions are directed to screenmated|pg||
nt|jbennet: must have been a misunderstanding here.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and  BOTH players alert partnership bids|pg||
nt|pbundy: i don't think that justin can even go wrong on the lead - vis a vis being able to beat the contract|pg||
nt|jbennet: x followed by pass should not be forcing. |pg||
nt|ahollan1: it sure looks like 2N was for minors|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 2N wasn't alerted|pg||
nt|jbennet: therefore 2NT should not be natural but competitive for miors|pg||
nt|bobholl: i can only say it wins 1 imp probably but if w had bid 7@S :)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|udo: parscore reached|pg||
nt|star6ija: he cannot afford to leave opps here as far as 2@d could be made as well as 3@cs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: correct   Aronov-Stefanov NT=14-16|pg||
nt|antoniz: +1 imp|pg||
nt|lml: a diamond lead makes it a piece of cake :0|pg||
nt|oosmanb: 4@h-3  in board 5?? Might be entered wrong|pg||
nt|bt: in the open room grue was very aggressive and paid a heavy price|pg||
nt|brolucius: The top 8 teams in the round-robin, at end of play tonight, will enter the quarter-finals of the knock-out stage.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: pairs need to define whether or not DBL creates force -- and if so, up to what level|pg||
pc|c7|nt|famus: wd--wonder whether the other room wud b pushed to limits|pg||
nt|athene: shouldn't be hard to find the diamond ruff|pg||
nt|athene: ok, might be harder now|pg||
nt|athene: lauria doesn't know his partner has quite so many clubs|pg||
nt|kemperg: sorry lost connection|pg||
nt|ady: taken the plunge     looks like 2 spade trricks and 2 diamonds     |pg||
nt|panosk: still talking about last hand privately sorry :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: anyway the 1S opening let them stop in time.  Seems to lose nly 1S, 2H and 2D, but maybe 1 3rd D.  Declarer shud have covered DK|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|lml: Baxter is heading to dummy for a diamond pictch on the heart  and a spade play|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: exactly!|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: so he does not have to take the @d decision|pg||
nt|lml: there may be a trump promotion on a diamond play now |pg||
nt|stoffers: Ah, nice|pg||
nt|lechcold: 11 lew jeli rozegramy kara przed kierami (konieczne z uwagi na blokadê kar)|pg||
nt|boedhy:  only problem is if somebody has 5@s so will hold up once|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: live scores back thanfully, see all matches here http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm|pg||
nt|runnerup: entryes are difficult |pg||
nt|skaftij:  This will need a @h guess at least|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Duboin and Hou showing each other the hands|pg||
nt|gracelin: club shift is most damaging now|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|boedhy:  will make this |pg||
nt|boedhy:  still not working on my mac..|pg||
nt|brolucius: The team cominb 1st can choose their opponents from those 5-8. The team coming second has the next choice, etc...|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: creative lead by Cornell|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: dbl by bertheau on 2@s would have been penalty he says|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems to me most play DBL forces at 2-level|pg||
pc|d7|nt|athene: but still i think @DK shift is ok|pg||
nt|athene: if the @CQ got covered|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so maybe it will be 1N in the other room|pg||
nt|xenya: S had better duck this and see what happens|pg||
nt|roswolf: and found|pg||
pc|d2|nt|boedhy:  but with the @h 4-1 you better not be in 3..|pg||
nt|boedhy:  http://www.wkbridge2011.nl/live/scorebord-bermuda-bowl|pg||
nt|oosmanb: I thought that would be flat at all 60+ tables|pg||
nt|fabsayc: with some restrictions, top four teams get to select their opponents from the other four|pg||

nt|lechcold: ...pika, by stworzyæ rozgrywaj¹cemu jak¹ grobê|pg||
nt|odysseus69: what action over 3S? double or 4H?|pg||
nt|ady: would you not prefer double  than 4@H Victor  and then possibly bid  diamonds if partner responds clubs?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: kibitzer rightly suggests that West should think again when 4H is doubled|pg||
nt|boedhy:  this works on my computer|pg||
nt|skaftij:  a cunning low @s?|pg||
nt|brolucius: If you are 4th, you usually find yourself with some stiff opponents that none of the other top 4 wanted to face.|pg||
nt|kit: Well, this sure isn't what I expected|pg||
pc|sK|nt|bt: this is a soft result by ew but bidding game and making it was not in the cards|pg||
nt|brolucius: Can someone post the web-address for the ruinning scores?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|skaftij:  nope|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: @CK asked for count there i would imagine|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Should make comfortably|pg||
nt|jbgood: easy to go wrong in defense - but Fallenius thought it through|pg||
nt|hantveit: no rush to overtake club q as boye holds HK|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|stoffers: yes, will just make now|pg||
nt|ady: that at least gives a chance of reaching a good spot   or possibly 3@SX|pg||
nt|andersk: I dont think so, I looked at bidding and it seemes like Fredin Falleinus had a misunderstanding!|pg||
nt|oosmanb: oops|pg||
nt|jbennet: DD 3NT unbeatable.|pg||
nt|jbennet: but east doesnt know it. |pg||
nt|runnerup: east is worried that 1s are not 3-3 .that is one problems out of fju|pg||
nt|jbennet: awkward communication problems. |pg||
nt|jbennet: east doestn know that NS is unable to take 3 d tricks.|pg||
nt|jbennet: west..|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed -- if he cashes @CK now and crosses to @SQ to take two clubs, what will he discard from dummy? |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: they made in the open room|pg||
nt|ahollan1: was he supposed to start @C firsr?|pg||
nt|yusufb: salvoda direktore bunlar kayda alýnsýn demiþ|pg||
pc|hK|nt|athene: they play upside down|pg||
nt|ady: might make an overtrrick as it has gone|pg||
nt|ady: cards lay well for declarer |pg||

nt|bt: we have 5 teams battling for last two spots|pg||
nt|brolucius: Thanks to the kibs who sent me the link.|pg||
nt|xenya: so this appears to be a poor line|pg||
nt|jbennet: if he cashes club ace and enters hanf with sp Q then no make.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @S9 promised 10  [Rusinow]|pg||
nt|pbundy: nystrom can get up to 8 now ...|pg||
nt|jbennet: this is en axample why top pairs should emphasize NOT on slam bidding in undisturbed auctions, but to define thier methods in common competitive situations. suck as this one.|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: nystrom asking how light 2@c can be|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: grue saying he does it on 'sick' hands|pg||
nt|pbundy: my guess is he is weighing whether or not to go for 8 tricks - or cash out|pg||
nt|ahollan1: almost always shows 13 cards|pg||
nt|pbundy: if the diamond is off - won't be pretty|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 21  Fredin opens intermediate 2@S and plays there|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that was hand with the slow auction to perfecta 4@S|pg||
nt|jbennet: note that 2NT balnacing bid was well chosen enabling ew to find laydown 3 cl|pg||
nt|pbundy: a report from a relative of one of the players that they are declaring 2@S in the other room|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|nt|lml: so no problems now|pg||
nt|odysseus69: yes prefer double but I have become modern??? and play 4D=D and H|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|lml: it is terribly hard to see that a diamond would help from the south hand|pg||
nt|lml: declarer has a chance to make it even if south ducks the club as many you suggest|pg||
nt|lml: but probably wont|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: small @d lead would have been great by N|pg||
nt|lml: baxter can throw a club on the heart and guess diamonds|pg||
nt|lml: anyway this is now a push|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|boedhy:  @d back costs a trick|pg||
nt|jbennet: good shot so far .|pg||
nt|gracelin: if he ruff spade first he can establish a spade winner to discard one of the losers.|pg||
nt|hantveit: -1 now|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|wild card: in the other room, west raised his partner to 3NT immediately|pg||
nt|wild card: a good bid in my opinion although we can see 3NT won't make on this board|pg||
pc|h6|nt|xenya: now declarer "knows" @Ds are 3-3|pg||
nt|panosk: E will be worried momentarily about a @D ruff but he soon be relieved|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm also watching that room via  http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|brolucius: New Zealand are the only real surprise in the top 8 at the moment. Well done to them.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|star6ija: first blood US, unless Aronov steal 8th trick|pg||
nt|boedhy:  but with the @s with open is understandable otherwise you can see the 4 @h in hand|pg||

nt|boedhy:  another good result for Brink Drijver...|pg||
nt|ady: likely 4@H|pg||

nt|kamyk: gdyby to by³a @S D...|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 6 boards in 75 mins is painfuly slow|pg||
nt|xenya: still down but only 1|pg||
nt|xenya: same idea|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Sorry, wrong claim at first|pg||
nt|roswolf: -3?|pg||
nt|bobholl: 1 down is good bridge|pg||
nt|nkgupt: isnt the S bidding (preempting) his hand in pieces....think always a bad policy|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: smolen and 4@S i guess, here|pg||
nt|wild card: by staying somewhat lower, south africa gained 3 IMPs, getting the lead in this match|pg||
nt|barnets: that was a flat board same result in open|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: losing 2 clubs and 1 diamond|pg||
nt|bt: not that u guys care about that|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=2+  and is forcing|pg||
nt|ady: very swing hands so far    but only 4 imps in it|pg||
mb|1C|an| |nt|rnmalik: 4@H a likely contract for NS and makeable as the cards are placed.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: however 5D should not escape from a double|pg||
nt|jbgood: very good result for the Aussies here|pg||
nt|boedhy:  The youngsters (ok 30) are among the top 5 in the world|pg||
nt|runnerup: 4 @s looks makeable but deeds some guesses|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: time penalties are looming in this room|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=10-15 HCP, 2+@D    |pg||
nt|bobholl: 1nt 3nt i guess|pg||
mb|1H|nt|vugraphznv: West noticed 4@S was cold last board|pg||
nt|boedhy:  are they in @h that plays better|pg||
nt|skaftij:  in OR, South had a heavy 2NT available, showing minors|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: another doubled contract made in the open room|pg||
nt|runnerup: spades must be handled -by odds ,but @h must be ducked once -and then you have chances|pg||
nt|hantveit: yes|pg||
mb|d|an|!S|nt|athene: ok, some cunning system :)|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: they play some convention here..but they will end in 4@S|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: I am not really sure what 2@D is maybe forcing stayman|pg||
nt|lml: the spade bid will deter East|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am recording the rugby, so no scores, please.|pg||
nt|bt: and grue lall decided 7@C was good here|pg||
nt|brolucius: 30 points but the hands do not fit too well, and the cards lie poorly too.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can't upgrade here because 3rd seat vul and 4th seat always 15-17|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=@D   go figure|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2 only (2 imps carry over)|pg||
mb|1N|an|!H|nt|athene: the EW convention card just says stayman, transfers, 3x = shortness but obviously 2@D has some other possibilities|pg||
nt|ron_sc2002: madala allowed to play 4@C in the last board|pg||
nt|famus: til now in all their outings Italy has been on a rampage|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: I guess Versace said to the whole table :)|pg||
nt|athene: north had a borderline double of 1@H|pg||
nt|jbgood: yes - since N had no entry to give prd a diamond ruff|pg||
nt|boedhy:  Ah de Wijs made an uptrick|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: they in NT also 1 imp|pg||
nt|boedhy:  looking at that scoreboard the first 6 temas are pretty save..|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Yes N 5@d doubled|pg||
nt|gracelin: Chicken, I expected 4S|pg||
nt|roswolf: so did i|pg||
mb|p|an|<3 !S|nt|ron_sc2002: so Italy is already in 20-0 after 6 boards|pg||
nt|athene: wow - not often you get pushed to 5major, go one down, and gain an imp|pg||
nt|athene: my guess is, east in the other room did not bid 4@H because he was worried about pushing opps into a making 5@C|pg||
nt|athene: but that is not usually a good strategy - better to assume opps will do/have done the right thing|pg||
nt|athene: that way at least you don't fall below par|pg||
nt|lml: so what do you like with east|pg||
nt|lml: seems like we have found the actual auction|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: now for east; what shall he do with 1@s bid in N?|pg||
nt|lml: still should east bid?|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: thinking.......by E|pg||
nt|wild card: the four diamonds in the north hand make it liekly for partner to be short|pg||
nt|boedhy:  and you can see why in these 6 boards|pg||

nt|ady: yes  2 imps   there was a 2 imp carry over|pg||
nt|brgpro: X=4+@s and pass denied 3?|pg||
nt|brgpro: 1NT must be some kind of @h raise|pg||
nt|brgpro: a good 2@H it looks|pg||
mb|2S|nt|wild card: four spades is not too far off actually|pg||
nt|rnmalik: AQ@C and @S Ace nicely placed. Key cards for the contract.|pg||
nt|jbgood: brb|pg||
nt|skaftij:  a @s lead did nothing to embarass declarer|pg||
nt|bt: aha rugby is tomorrow, the nz team hopes for bridge and rugby at that time|pg||
nt|xenya: another opportunity for NZ?|pg||
nt|roswolf: but this has scored a goal methinks|pg||
nt|gracelin: NS can make 6C if knows to drop Q, In reality, making 5C will be a solid result|pg||
nt|gracelin: and 3NT is equally good.|pg||
nt|roswolf: wow they might get there now|pg||
nt|mdgraham: rehi lost connx again :(|pg||
nt|bobholl: if you play gazilli you could pass now relxedly but now ??|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: you just must trust your teammates bid their cards properly|pg||
nt|lml: not surprised east thought|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: not a bad lead for n/s|pg||
nt|athene: is this pause him considering doubling now, or lauria considering doing something?|pg||
nt|athene: ok|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: it was Lauria thinking|pg||
nt|antoniz: czeæ Grzesiu:)|pg||
nt|jbennet: is 4 sp really makeable against best defence??|pg||
nt|hantveit: 9 tricks in closed|pg||
nt|bobholl: unlucky lead but reasonable|pg||
mb|3H|nt|vugraphznv: that was a hesitating 3@S bid..|pg||
nt|udo: in 21 italy took all their tricks ( down 4) against this 2 @S,,and they played it doubled,,so another 12 imps|pg||
nt|ady: unsafe balance for north in my opinion|pg||
nt|xenya: at last an easy hand|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: looks like south bid 4N as to play|pg||
nt|boedhy:  ah there is some low level bidding|pg||
nt|brolucius: Oh, it's tomorrow.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, we are away for the week-end and I set the recorder.|pg||
nt|garden2005: mamy potencja³ i naboje?|pg||
nt|runnerup: now @h possition is clear -so helps to play|pg||
nt|gracelin: actually 4S maybe doubled for 800, but might also push NS into reaching a wrong contract.|pg||
nt|roswolf: it cant cost south to make one voluntary squeak ans bifddding 4@C gets them to the races|pg||
nt|roswolf: this certainly does|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: east I feel only woth an invite opposite    but west would have accepted|pg||
nt|ady: is this also 14-16 no-trump Jan ?|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 15-17|pg||
nt|oosmanb: board 6 has some interesting auctions at other tables|pg||
nt|andersk: Better cash he's 6 tricks, If he looses a club trick early he might go 4 down|pg||
nt|skaftij:  seems to North that his @s will not be pulling weight|pg||
nt|garden2005: no jak teraz @h? siê czuj¹|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: tak Grzesiu...niestety naboje co drugi lepy|pg||
nt|kamyk: chyba nieporozumienie: Gawrys przyj¹³, ¿e 3BA, to m³ode|pg||
nt|garden2005: Gawry móg³ daæ 4@s po 3NT, ¿e ma dwa kolory|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: w³¹snie Grzesiu s³yszysz wystrza³ lepym nabojem|pg||
nt|kamyk: to przyk³ad, co znaczy sta³a para - ona ju¿ tam kiedy by³a; para zestawiona nawet z dobrych graczy w trakcie przygotowañ wszystkiego nie zdo³a omówiæ|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3@S is stronger than 4@S and promises some values (at least one control somewhere).|pg||
mb|p|nt|star6ija: the law of the total trumps :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 6 trumps for NS...|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Hmm, can you concede tricks that you cannot possibly loose?|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: he wrote -100|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Don't know the law too well|pg||
nt|stoffers: Nor really, but operator or players watching arent to say anything |pg||
nt|xenya: you can make 6 here -- but you don't want to be there|pg||
nt|boedhy:  aggresive but controled bidding,  combined with perfect play and some luck :)|pg||
nt|ady: thx   15-17   but even so vould be facing a poor heart holding   west has a nice toppy hand with good hearts|pg||
nt|jbgood: Hi David and Lars! I can assure you that the kiwi team has the right focus on today's matches:)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: seven would have been fine if south had diamond ace rather than KQ|pg||
nt|bt: how did england do? wales was 4th i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: When North cannot cue-bid in hearts, declarer will know of one hole in his hand.|pg||
nt|brgpro: this is already too high|pg||
nt|ady: looks 1 over the top|pg||
pc|c6|nt|skaftij:  but...|pg||
nt|skaftij:  4 imps to Iceland probably|pg||
nt|fabsayc: even then is thin though with only 8 trumps|pg||
nt|brolucius: The text-books advise you not to bid a grand if there is any chance that the other room will miss the small slam. They also have some advice (I forget it at the moment) about how ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: many aces you need for a grand slam.|pg||
nt|garden2005: w ocenie od zg³aszaj¹cych mi na priv Kibiców, Gawry nie mai³ na 5@d|pg||
nt|runnerup: ok -partscore board ?|pg||
nt|jbennet: how is 4sp makeable?? |pg||
nt|skaftij:  1@c Relay Precision|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D looks like a checkback |pg||
nt|skaftij:  Sry|pg||
nt|gracelin: I don't see any reason declarer should guess to drop HQ doubleton offside.|pg||
nt|roswolf: impressive bidding judgment -truly World Class|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and the lead has changed|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2nt is best :)|pg||
pc|c5|nt|vugraphznv: Duboin picked 3 times the 3@S bid..|pg||
nt|famus: can he hit @cs?|pg||
nt|kemperg: EW play sound 1 openings|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 2NT ask and Alfredo now bid 3NT, max no shortness|pg||
nt|lechcold: po tym ataku no problem|pg||
nt|odysseus69: notice that Zack did not get carried away and bid only 3S where others might have bid game|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: West trying to speed up, they are 2 boards behind|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: South sorry, think for being slow|pg||
nt|bt: anyway i think lall bid way too much at the other table|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't think it has come up yet   EW  1st discard = odd/even|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW leads  2nd/4th|pg||
nt|kit: I don't think South should be showing any encouragement -- he has a dead minimum 2@C opener|pg||
nt|brolucius: North thought he was too strong to sign off in 4@S, with two kings in his hand.|pg||
nt|barnets: playing 3N i open after south rebid 2N|pg||
nt|roswolf: italian flair patrick:)|pg||
nt|gracelin: let's see :)|pg||
pc|c9|nt|stoffers: If one of the pairs finds out they will ofcource correct the score|pg||
nt|kit: This is a good example of control bid crazy, when controls aren't the problem.  Tricks are.|pg||
nt|barnets: and did not bid spades at all|pg||
nt|hantveit: I prefer @h|pg||
nt|hantveit: if you find partner with KQxx or KJxx in a major suit. It dos not really help you if it is @S|pg||
nt|bobholl: berry (westra) says 4th best from your longest :)|pg||
nt|hantveit: sounds like a wise guy :)|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|lechcold: silny trefl u Szwedów..dalej pewnie masa sztucznoci, których nie znam:(|pg||
nt|lechcold: ale skoñczy siê na 3BA:)|pg||
nt|lechcold: Panie 48:0 po 6 rozdaniach vs. Maroko:) mo¿e to oznaka prze³omu?|pg||
nt|lechcold: kierowy by³by morderczy|pg||
nt|boedhy:  NS can make 3@c tho|pg||
nt|xenya: well N had passed over 3@S -- no reason to be clever now i think|pg||
pc|s7|nt|brolucius: You can see the other auction by putting your cursor over the Open Room result.|pg||
nt|bt: unless their firm agreement is that 5NT in all auctions is "pick a slam"|pg||
nt|runnerup: you lose 1 @s -1 @h -throw one to @c k -and 1 @c ofcause|pg||
nt|xenya: especially as he should know @Hs are likely to be 3-3 for his side|pg||
nt|brolucius: Now they surely stop in 5@S.|pg||
nt|roswolf: in practice this may well be the decisive hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: the first 6 bds have been full of drama|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2 chances to attack @D|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|famus: a natural @s lead -wont get them anywhere|pg||
nt|ady: if this lead is from length the 9@C will ensure only 2 club losers  so the game depends on A@D right|pg||
pc|s3|nt|vugraphznv: 3@H = 15+  5-5 , rest goes without saying|pg||
nt|stoffers: Duboin knowing about a diamondlooser now (no 4@d)|pg||
nt|lechcold: bardzo trafny rebid Gawrysia|pg||
nt|kamyk: gdyby Gawrys powiedzia³ zwyczajnie 2@D, to co sie licytuje z kart¹ E? Mówi¹c 1BA uproci³ rozdanie.|pg||
nt|ady: tricky defence here|pg||
nt|ady: need to win A@S   andplay 9@H|pg||
nt|odysseus69: looks like 9 tricks whatever defence does- cant get club ruff and 2 heart tricks|pg||
nt|boedhy:  alot of comment on this remark.|pg||
nt|bvdahl:  can't win this without help from defense|pg||
nt|kit: they should, but it is too high.|pg||
nt|bobholl: world champion 1993 :)|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|athene: protecting the @DK on the lead doesn't really help EW any|pg||
nt|jbennet: even if taking right view in spades and hearts no way to handle the 2nd heart loser. |pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry, i missed it    Fredin DID  DBL 3N on 22|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't know if NS play Smith   their CC doesn't really describe carding very well|pg||
nt|bobholl: i don't see a way to prevent 1 down|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ryskiel_: czy Volva produkowane pzrez Szwedów s¹ te¿ sztuczn¹ metod¹ robione?|pg||
nt|jbgood: may be a double game swing if he takes the heart finesse and finds the trump|pg||
nt|bt: anyway the ns auction at the other table was one of those toughies and they failed, it is good for my team so i am happy|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: tylko nie w pika|pg||
nt|garden2005: jedne z komentarzy do rozdania: "mia³ powiedzieæ 4@H  a jak P ma m³ode to przeniesie siê 5@C na 5@D  a tak to du,,,,,,,,! " :)|pg||
nt|garden2005: witamy Cezarego Balickiego :)|pg||
nt|garden2005: ech.... zasypalicie mnie ju¿ tyloma propozycjami innej licytacji G-K, ¿e nawet nie wiem która przytoczyæ ... ka¿da jest lepsza ni¿ ta co siê zdarzy³a|pg||
nt|brolucius: North would of course bid 6@S with the @SK.|pg||
nt|kit: Better I think to find out if you have strength for slam at 4-level and worry about controls at 5-level rather than other way around.|pg||
nt|barnets: would you rebid  2@S or 2N with south hand ?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Close.|pg||
nt|barnets: 2N is the winner|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|lml: once south plays the clubs he now knows he has the contract|pg||
nt|kemperg: @D had been down|pg||
nt|athene: small trump, ducked, now?|pg||
nt|famus: got to switch @d second chance|pg||
nt|athene: then the defence retain control|pg||
nt|athene: if versace continues trying for club ruff they can go @CK, @HA, club|pg||
nt|udo: @D needed to beat this|pg||
nt|athene: a diamond shift works too yes|pg||
nt|farrukh: Both ways to beat it. Either @h duck or @d shift|pg||
nt|udo: yes,,,|pg||
nt|athene: in fact having the @HA gives the defence so much control, they can always prevail|pg||
nt|athene: even if they just give a tempo away with a spade, that is fine too|pg||
nt|athene: because then if versace played a club, north could play a diamond and later give his pd a ruff|pg||
nt|famus: Tahir thinking|pg||
nt|athene: and if versace plays a trump, north just DUCKS and that's the end|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: S asks Versace if he has shown 6@hs - and Versace tells him that he has shown that|pg||
nt|famus: @D cant be a losing option--even with @h K with pd|pg||
nt|athene: well, a diamond might be wrong sometimes|pg||
nt|odysseus69: well spotted David|pg||
nt|ady: got the first bit right|pg||
nt|odysseus69: might well find H9|pg||
nt|ady: still not that great a game even with a suitable hand with west|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: games that win are good games :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Here North was able to ask for key cards, so there was no problem. Sweden gained advantage from their spade pre-emption at the other table.|pg||
nt|kit: I agree close -- either could work out.  Probably 2NT a favorite on balance.|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: North said : do not go down in 5|pg||
nt|kit: Granted 5@S somewhat unlucky to go down.  But with better bidding they wouldn't have been facing the bad luck.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Give North the other black jack and it would be not so bad.|pg||
nt|hantveit: sounds like an old wise guy|pg||
pc|dK|nt|athene: for example if partner has the @DA and you need to set up a spade and have declarer misguess diamonds?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Moysian fit = 4-3   is this Mini-Moysian  or is that 4-2 fit|pg||
nt|roswolf: a swing of 25/26 imps |pg||
nt|hantveit: :)|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|famus: wud he duck???|pg||
nt|ady: 1 trump out of the way|pg||
pc|h2|nt|stoffers: 6 (lucky) imps to Iceland on bd21, they take what they get against opponents like this|pg||
nt|boedhy:  think i wouldnt have passed with north although i opened light|pg||
nt|barnets: yes the @CJ needs to be a spade|pg||
pc|h6|nt|athene: nowhere to put the diamond losers anyway|pg||
nt|athene: hard to find that duck|pg||
nt|famus: swing|pg||
nt|kemperg: he knows @CA with partner, so @DA on leader|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: ju¿ wiem ¿e Volvo produkuje siê teraz w Chinach, wiec na pewno sztucznie|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Sorry everyone I must leave now, thanks to all the organizers|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ahollan1: on  6 the auction was 1N-all pass|pg||
nt|star6ija: Karaivanov would be surprized realizing that Trendafilov still is not shorter in trumps than him|pg||
nt|jbgood: but still a big gain for Australia|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|athene: actually maybe it was not that hard|pg||
pc|c7|nt|runnerup: maybe -too dfficult -because rigth 2 @s to defence|pg||
pc|cT|pc|h5|nt|lml: he can probably afford a heart now for the uptrick ... we know it will work|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: S had @s 4 in his hands to play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  6   Muller in 2N|pg||
nt|barnets: this is a big swing for usa|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|brolucius: East was unable to read the opening lead of the @S9.|pg||
nt|xenya: think i'll get coffee|pg||
pc|h3|nt|famus: Tahir must b cursing himself for not switching @ds--this is turning into a rout|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Better :-)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: yes sorry|pg||
nt|brolucius: Not that it matters.|pg||
nt|bt: decl has 12 easy tricks now and a bundle of imps to sweden|pg||
pc|h8|nt|athene: if his partner has the @DA, the contract is always dead|pg||
nt|ady: should be in game   but I dont feel east should be the one to deccide if there an invitational method|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|lml: or a spade|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: nice play|pg||
nt|udo: i think he should find the duck,,,he knows @D are running most of the time|pg||
nt|lechcold: prawdopodobnie Szwedzi nie byli w stanie zbadaæ co maj¹ w treflach|pg||
nt|runnerup: so no attack to Nyström for pushing ns to game|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: director in the room ....we will not finish all the boards i think|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|boedhy:  but then west at some point would have bid his @s and making 3 is no problem so think this will be a push|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: s³owem wylosowali z³¹ sekwencjê sporód wielu lepszych|pg||
nt|ady: will need to untangle the spades|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|vugraphznv: i think i missed somethink|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: something|pg||
nt|brolucius: It may all hand on the meaning of 3NT. If that is serious or non-serious, that would effect how strongly North should bid - whether he was worth going past 4@S with his second ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: king.|pg||
nt|kit: If declarer believed king of spades is singleton he might have had a double-dummy line to make on trump end-play.  But Levin could easily play king from Kx.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|brolucius: On a lucky day you would make 6@S; today you go down in 5@S.|pg||
pc|h9|nt|athene: and if declarer has the @DA, it is clear that playing ace and another trump just releases control and allows the diamonds to run|pg||
nt|ady: club ruff coming soon|pg||
nt|ady: needs to ruff high|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup cant understand why he didnt draw a 2nd round of trumps|pg||
nt|ady: if they are in a position to draw a 3rd round would go down   had not developed enough tricks|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|d5|nt|athene: this is very often a problem for the defence - whether to draw trumps or not|pg||
nt|lml: declarer in 4@H makes an easy 5 |pg||
nt|barnets: like the belladonna hand v Kantar|pg||
nt|roswolf: wd|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer is one trick short to exercise the show-up squeeze, when West need to keep his D and discard one Heart.|pg||
nt|roswolf: declarer will get a coubt on the hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: count|pg||
pc|d9|nt|athene: when declarer is trying for a ruff but has a threatening side-suit as well|pg||
nt|athene: and underleading or ducking the ace of trumps is often the key|pg||
nt|ady: diamond play has helped declarer|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dT|pg||
pc|sA|nt|star6ija: this appear to be dreat swing for Bulgaria|pg||
nt|star6ija: great*|pg||
nt|barnets: in the final  |pg||
nt|brolucius: Kamil rebid 2NT to win a big swing.|pg||
nt|barnets: when Kantar could have played the K from kx|pg||
nt|barnets: in 7@C|pg||
nt|barnets: very similar idea|pg||
nt|barnets: well spotted|pg||
pc|s2|nt|boedhy:  but west would have bid @s so this will be a push i think|pg||
nt|hantveit: woul it not be better to play hearts at once, while you still had club communication?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ady: not good this   vul|pg||

nt|rnmalik: Can EW bid and make 6@C?|pg||
nt|lechcold: cztery pasy raczej niemo¿liwe na drugim stole:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL=takeout of @S|pg||
nt|szalay: semiforcing, probably|pg||
nt|ady: routine 3NT for n/s|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: may get too high here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: after 1N-2@C//2@H-2N   does he pass or try 3@H?|pg||
nt|antoniz: cztery pasy to ¿art?|pg||

nt|psyck:  EW: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2011Veldhoven/BermudaBowl/Israel/barel-zack.pdf|pg||
nt|psyck:  Results & Live Scores: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm|pg||
nt|panosk: thx CK|pg||
nt|psyck:  Israel 4th & Sweden 9th as per current running scores|pg||
nt|hantveit: looks like 3 clubs is hard to make.|pg||
nt|bobholl: @C lead and 4@H down|pg||
pc|hA|nt|star6ija: drury?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry  yes 2@C=Drury  3+ fit|pg||
nt|lml: 1NT is of course the weak variety|pg||
nt|lml: I think South will bid ...what do you think|pg||
nt|xenya: S may well get in now|pg||
nt|lml: I say this from there style|pg||
nt|lml: their|pg||
nt|psyck:  The Results site occasionally goes down due to load, just keep trying later (it worked for me now)|pg||
nt|boedhy:  good defence again on the last board by the way|pg||
nt|boedhy:  2@s pp d p2nt 3@s all pass|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: I just have been asked to turn off the heat again|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: "Super" said Brink / and started singing "Super Trouper" -- "is that from Iceland" he then asked :)|pg||
nt|boedhy:  Yoou must ask Drijver if his hormons are bothering him :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: :) Jan being worked hard'|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: No its not -- its from Sweden -- ABBa|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and then S continues singing --- I think he is a better bridgeplayer than singer|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: I cant see exactly what Duboin wrote|pg||
nt|brolucius: The young USA2 team is some 30 VPs ahead of USA1.|pg||
nt|bt: sweden might play 3@C in both rooms here|pg||
nt|bt: which is generally a bad concept|pg||
nt|runnerup: good 6 @s -with tricks not so many points -and sing @c -agains Ace -so a very good -unbeatable one|pg||
nt|vahaboglu: @cJ ataðýn blokasyonu mu olur|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm  was that a little chicken?|pg||
pc|hT|nt|athene: and the italians don't like 1NT with a 5-card major, for some reason|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=a) some game interest  b) mild slam try|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: South writing explanations|pg||
nt|ady: 2 level high enough|pg||
nt|antoniz: oby nie szlemik na impasie Damy trefl|pg||
nt|lml: wrong again ... shucks|pg||
nt|ady: but not neccessarily making     lay out bad|pg||
nt|bobholl: strange pass |pg||
nt|ady: club lead to beat 4@H   can get 2 ruffs |pg||
pc|h8|nt|ahollan1: 2@H would be strong game interest, nothing about @H|pg||
nt|star6ija: 2@d shows maybe normal openning... or long suit game try|pg||
nt|ady: e/w   busy here|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: the bulgarians like the red cards|pg||
nt|ady: as usual   honor 10 of  suit in dummy when leading the Queen|pg||
nt|panosk: key place is 8th that leads to quarterfinals but its early to say|pg||
nt|boedhy:  no spade lead.... |pg||
nt|skaftij:  It is quite a task, both to operate and to comment, you are doing a great job Jan|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: i was wondering why he did not discard the heart loser and looked into his hand and was missing lol|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: all bids are alerted|pg||
nt|gracelin: China recovered 13 imps on the hand EW stopped in 3NT with their 30 HCP after south opened 1S.  Italians went down in 5C in other room.|pg||
nt|jbennet: again agressive auction EW will now lose their laydown 4 sp (or 5d)|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|stoffers: Good operator, thx|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: also without saying, so i'll change now that he has 110|pg||
nt|stoffers: Yes, wd|pg||
nt|wild card: if they bid it, I guess they'll make|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: i am not Jan loool|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: móg³ te¿ jedna lewê uratowaæ w rozgrywce|pg||
nt|ady: diamond lead especially   with major high cards badly places   not easy|pg||
nt|roswolf: in which case after the last hand here the match is suddenly tight with 40 bds to go|pg||
nt|bobholl: even DD i can't see a normal way |pg||
pc|hK|nt|lml: the hands fit well for a heart slam ... but spades will make too on the break|pg||
nt|lechcold: vugraf nam powie co siê sta³o |pg||
nt|ryskiel_: nie podniecajcie siê, na pewno nie nast¹pi³y 4 pasy|pg||
nt|lechcold: miejmy nadziejê|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: probowalam napisac do vugrapha na drugim stole, ale nie jest zalogowany|pg||
nt|psyck:  Italy, Netherland, USA2 the top 3|pg||
nt|panosk: 6@H or NT are both cold the thing is to be there|pg||
nt|boedhy:  and with the way Drijver played his @h telling his partner he had a trick in @c|pg||
nt|oosmanb: wow probably 6@C now|pg||
nt|andersk: good bidding here. |pg||
nt|xenya: Sweden and NZ are currently neck-in-neck, with Japam trailing by 1VP|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it does indeed look as if Dhondy's 2@d (after 1@c-1NT) was spades and another - if so, that would explain Senior's 2@s, if not why she didn't bid 2@h en route|pg||
nt|anton72: Dhondy bid 2 @c ....|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: sorry|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|wild card: but after this start that will be too hard|pg||
nt|xenya: in the other room, NS pushed EW to the 3-level|pg||
nt|kit: Levin's aggressive preempt keeps N-S out of spades -- but that is good for N-S.|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3@D did its work.|pg||
nt|kit: But still probably unable to make 3NT.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: very good result for England next door|pg||
nt|pbundy: there seems to be some misunderstanding here - no?|pg||
nt|brgpro: pass...i won't but it is a good judgement here with the @c ruff coming, 4@h is -1|pg||
pc|h7|nt|star6ija: do they?|pg||
nt|ady: well stopped|pg||
nt|jbgood: another imp for the overtrick|pg||
nt|skaftij:  :-)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Jan is in the open room|pg||
nt|szalay: trump|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2nd/4th leads mean  LOW from worthless doubleton|pg||
nt|szalay: to be honest small trump is the best lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: clarification just in case other North Americans are in the room|pg||
nt|bobholl: despite the unlucky lead this won't make|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW made it easy to stay low|pg||
nt|star6ija: why then they did not use them during the previous board :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: lol..i think they discussed it|pg||
nt|star6ija: yes sometimes the silence is golden|pg||
nt|skaftij:  1NT = 14-16|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: aha, interwencja sedziowska|pg||
nt|lokaty: z³e rozdania by³y i sêdzia przy stole naprawia b³¹d|pg||
nt|antoniz: dziêkujemy:)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: aha, kibic mowi, ze pomieszaly sie rozdania 8 i 9|pg||
nt|boedhy:  Drijver is only 30 but he was old when he was 20....|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Your profile says otherwise|pg||
nt|antoniz: dwie|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3@d aldo suggests a singleton somewhere|pg||
nt|bobholl: very inspired pass by sjoert|pg||
nt|brgpro: now a @s for -2|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|lml: a hard slam to reach but I thought they might|pg||
nt|lml: south has to do something other than 4@h I suppose|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: too difficult to find out that either of them has enough entries|pg||
nt|brolucius: Lars, you have any idea of how/why West should bid 3@C? Did he pull the wrong card from the box?|pg||
nt|hlortz: yes sweden had a misunderstanding looks like 2@H/1@D[precision] was michaels as many play 2@D/@d as natural |pg||
nt|bt: they play some 2 Major jumps as 4 of that suit and a longer minor|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2@H showed hearts and another suit or at least that is what west thought|pg||
nt|bt: west played that convention|pg||
nt|brolucius: Usually best, I find, to treat 1@D as natural initially - even if it may be short.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Clever of the US North to keep quiet on his amazingly good clubs.|pg||
nt|bt: they only played together for 10 yrs, har to get (1m)-2M right :)|pg||
nt|bt: hard|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer ducks to break communications between West and East.|pg||
nt|kit: In other room Fleisher violated and opened 1@H on the strong 4-card suit -- to his regret, as he wound up in 3@H.|pg||
nt|anton72: verry bad lead by E ...but result is perfect for ENG|pg||
nt|mdgraham: of course, 4@hx would not have been so hot without the 2-2 trump break|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lml: one of the good things about passing is that you are not defending 4@S|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Anders we spoke too soon|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: ends in 5@s|pg||
nt|xenya: now it should make|pg||
nt|pbundy: perhaps grue thinks 2@C shows diamonds?|pg||
nt|jbennet: but on the other hand...|pg||
nt|jbennet: 12 tricks available in clubs.|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ahollan1:  7  Weinstein in 2N West|pg||
nt|boedhy:  So his hormons could be bothering him|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: what do you mean?|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: do you see my profile as Jan?|pg||
nt|kit: At both tables E-W were temporarily in 3@D whih doesn't make.  But very difficult for N-S to know that.  That is why preempts can be effective.  Even when they seem to get you to a ...|pg||
nt|kit: bad contract, they can still work.|pg||
nt|barnets: if east shifts a club dec may make the hand|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer will play for hearts 4-2, because of the 3@D bid, which leaves West with more non-diamonds than East.|pg||
nt|kit: How can it ever make?  4 hearts, 1 diamond, 1 clubs, 2 spades at most I think.|pg||
nt|barnets: by takiing 4 heart tricks|pg||
nt|brolucius: Looks like it.|pg||
nt|barnets: and enplayinq west in spades|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Then 2@C showed @C + @S|pg||
nt|ady: made in OR    chance for China|pg||
nt|gracelin: I don't see 6H making on this one.|pg||
nt|roswolf: north doing a lot of bidding - i would have given up on slam long ago|pg||
nt|gracelin: he does have a standard 2 opening and south gave a raise.|pg||
nt|gracelin: also some sign of life with the 3NT bid (rather than 4H).|pg||
nt|jbennet: 11|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 22 looks like Hurd will be down 2 in 3NX|pg||
nt|pbundy: even with a diamond out and a spade switch?|pg||
nt|jbennet: and only 10 if defence attack spades when being on lead|pg||
pc|dA|pg||

nt|pawel90:  3BA to Åredni kontrakt|pg||
nt|lml: I think Stansby can hold his losers to 3 black cards|pg||
nt|ady: of to the best lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: a test of south's cardplay|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: :) I think he can play|pg||
nt|roswolf: yu|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|roswolf: fine judgment you mean:)|pg||
mc|9|nt|barnets: for 3 spade tricks|pg||

nt|kamyk: ostatnio w Wilnie ktos mówi³ pó³¿artem, ¿e na Krzysztofów powinno siê graæ kontrami karnymi - oni faktycznie sie kulom nie k³aniaj¹:)|pg||
nt|xenya: so 1 imp to USA1|pg||
nt|lml: quite tight bridge by both teams|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: trying to get some time back|pg||
nt|boedhy:  very quick play so far|pg||
nt|ady: e/s have a slam|pg||
nt|oosmanb: probably some "polite" words being exchanged in Italian now|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: not after the board -- it was during the board -- I dont speak italian so I am not able to translate|pg||
nt|hlortz: some teams cant afford a coach :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: director back in the room|pg||

nt|xenya: i retract, sorry|pg||
nt|szalay: no|pg||
nt|szalay: small trump|pg||
nt|szalay: after cash AK|pg||
nt|kit: end-play for down 2 and a push|pg||
nt|ady: still 10 back for China   keeps them in the hunt|pg||
nt|pbundy: this could be a danger hand for USA  2, tho - if the spade switch is not found, 11 tricks are there|pg||
nt|pbundy: as we just saw.........|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  23  [3NW=]  Hurd 2@D East|pg||
nt|hantveit: interesting in closed as they failed 3nt by two tricks|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3nt is very optimistic|pg||
nt|roswolf: more distribution here|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w outgunned though|pg||
mb|1C|an| |nt|lml: and canada went ahead ... but with a lot of luck|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 10-12 1NT|pg||
nt|lml: they bid spades which was not the best slam|pg||
nt|lml: but the suit broke|pg||
nt|antoniz: Pawe³ to normalny kontrakt|pg||
nt|bt: ns took 10 tricks at the other table in clubs, and gained 5 imps, strange game this|pg||
nt|brolucius: A close friend of mine, Marc Smith, was coach to the young Thailand team in a recent world championship. (They had to practice in a  nearby horse-racing stadium, due to lack of ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: facilities). His great moment was when his proteges defeated Meckstroth/Rodwell's USA by a good margin!|pg||
nt|szalay: and 3@S, a ruff and 2 trumps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1st seat favorable  1N=9-12|pg||
nt|gracelin: Something must be wrong there. China kept on giving Bocchi chances and Bocchi gracefully rejected everytime.|pg||
nt|nkgupt: other tbl 4@h from S so almost impossible to defend|pg||
nt|brgpro: will make a game in @H for NS|pg||
nt|bobholl: other room 4 @H in south no @C lead :)|pg||
mb|1H|nt|athene: comes up a lot, generates swings|pg||
nt|athene: NS might be in a lot of trouble now they have gone past their 8-card fit|pg||
nt|pawel90:  wolalbym 5@c graÄ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: favorable means  you not vul   opponents vul|pg||
nt|skaftij:  2M=M+m (54),|pg||
nt|ahollan1: also called "green"|pg||
nt|pbundy: for those wanting plenty of swings and action - here it is....|pg||
nt|hantveit: yes, we look at all the cards, but it looks like a pass on easts hand on 1nt|pg||
nt|ady: all shapely except north  4-3-3-3|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: well done |pg||
nt|lml: to get to slam :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: indeed, nice bidding in open room|pg||
nt|udo: 2@D or 2 @H ?|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H a make e/w|pg||
nt|panosk: gd result for Sweeden a bit fortunate too|pg||
nt|runnerup: this will be another push one way or another (3 @c=) |pg||
nt|mdgraham: quite a good West hand, with two aces and four trumps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D is NOT 1-suited --  that hand opens 2@D|pg||
mb|1N|an| |nt|vugraphznv: blame me |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: :)|pg||
nt|star6ija: Weinstein did it well in board 7...almost equalized it :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: there's a lesson there about signalling with card you can't afford to play|pg||
nt|ady: another part score hand   clubs likely|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: the rest of the play correct...except the ten instead of the 5 at trick 2|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is thepressur of thecBB QF|pg||
nt|bobholl: "muiderberg" 5@H 4+ minor would have been nice in S|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Might be what 2@H means|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@H seems predestined|pg||
mb|p|nt|wild card: fleisher showing a 12-14 hand with four spades, I presume|pg||
nt|rnmalik: For NS 3 NT can make.|pg||
nt|boedhy:  board 24 again sorry to say but a very good result for the boys|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: on this board David or ?|pg||
nt|ady: thats 7 tricks in the bag|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: How strong is it asks W|pg||
nt|boedhy:  could have made it tho...|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: S answars "Usually 15-17"|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Jan, you could give Sementa a piece of paper to alert and explain his statements :)|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Very aggresive 3NT in OR|pg||
nt|kit: Double is responsive I believe.|pg||
nt|brolucius: 1@C 12+ points and 3+ clubs.|pg||
nt|ady: playable 4@H   but does not make|pg||
nt|ady: could be some more imps for China|pg||
nt|gracelin: and Italy in other room also went down in the 4S that need a good guess in Heart which became easy after south's double.|pg||
nt|hantveit: prec?|pg||
nt|bobholl: they bid 1nt 3nt too optimistic in east|pg||
nt|brgpro: they play mini NT here|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|lml: 6NT isnt terrible.  It just needs the spade finesse|pg||
nt|boedhy:  not easy to see which line is best but ruffing 2 @c in dummy was possible...|pg||
nt|szalay: I prefer to play this DBL rather 'cards' than pure penalty|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 7 boards 46 imps|pg||
mb|p|nt|udo: will end in 3 NT, i think|pg||
nt|famus: well this wud certainly propel them higher than desired|pg||
nt|boedhy:  10 opposite 11 and a quick 9 tricks|pg||
nt|boedhy:  yes 3@s down one|pg||
nt|boedhy:  could have been another 4 imps |pg||
nt|boedhy:  and those boards tend to add up...|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: I dont think thats a good idea at the moment|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  8  playing Tarzan Precision  Muller passed 1@S so Einarsson balanced 2@H|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Not the best dummy you saw|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2nd hand  doubleton @S led thru Q to partner's AKJxx|pg||
nt|kit: That will get E-W to hearts|pg||
nt|roswolf: COME BACK   FANTUNES -all is forgiven|pg||
nt|gracelin: so China is only down 17 and there are still two slam swings to their favor.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: they opened 1NT showing 16-18 in the open room|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|wild card: I see no reason for south to try something, at most 24 points in the combined hands|pg||
nt|wild card: and I count only 8 tricks in 3NT|pg||
nt|wild card: on a diamond lead|pg||
nt|ady: likely to end in 8|pg||
nt|anton72: unlucky values and numbers of diamonds in E |pg||
nt|mdgraham: so 3@h=good raise to 3@S (alas, on this lie one too high) - and 4@s is two too high |pg||
nt|ahollan1: we were told possible adjustment to hand from 5th set|pg||
nt|bobholl: 4@H just fails by 1 trick|pg||
mb|p|nt|udo: but cards dont lie very nice|pg||
nt|famus: 3NT|pg||
nt|athene: @CJ lead would be very nice|pg||
nt|skaftij:  and reached it|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 2@C  gazilli,  2@S less than 8  no 3@S|pg||
nt|skaftij:  2@c = 15+|pg||
nt|lml: but of course this is the normal contract|pg||
nt|xenya: but very tough to bid it|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Running scores in Bermuda Bowl http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Microsite/RunningScores/ASP/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?redirect=1&qtournid=881 |pg||
nt|skaftij:  and agressive 2@h bid here vul |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: correct score on 24 now|pg||
nt|xenya: 3@C= means that 1@C should be 3 down|pg||
nt|runnerup: no -they will get + 150 -200 now -wd|pg||
nt|roswolf: that dbl looks  a tilt double|pg||
nt|gracelin: south will be better off to take out this|pg||
nt|roswolf: i wouldnt|pg||
nt|gracelin: his opening was shaded and he has distribution.|pg||
nt|gracelin: on perfect defense, the decision is 790 Vs. 800|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the problem is that EW have, basically, two balanced hands|pg||
nt|anton72: yes u are right ...even K @d onside still not enough|pg||
nt|pbundy: which hand might that be, al?|pg||
nt|brgpro: so 1NT rebid is 13-16?|pg||
nt|roswolf: wearing orange tinted glasses bob:)|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: or natural|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: wow....rzeczywicie siê nie k³aniaj¹...|pg||

nt|lechcold: zw³aszcza, jeli s¹ dobrzy technicznie i odporni na ciosy|pg||
nt|lechcold: najlepszy przyk³ad to Meckwell|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Brink will struggle here|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: if north played 3nt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: he'd either open 1N with 12-14 or rebid 1N to show strong NT|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 1 spade and 2 trump tricks|pg||
nt|oosmanb: ok some play in 3Nt here|pg||
nt|kit: 2@H is safe.  3@H treacherous.  4@H, reached in other room, hopeless.|pg||
nt|hantveit: no way to stop here either|pg||
nt|bigtrain: certainly makes bidding with east easier to understand|pg||
mb|3D!|an|choose between 3NT and 4!H|nt|antoniz: Swietny wist|pg||
nt|pawel90:  na czesciowke z kontrÄ w atu. teraz bez wielu.|pg||
nt|oosmanb: but @h are friendly, @C ace is on|pg||
nt|oosmanb: but he might try to find J@S instead of playing on @h 3-3, lets see|pg||
nt|xenya: lack ot entries to dummy though|pg||
nt|bt: looks like a nice game but on a diamond lead it gets difficult, south is under a lot of pressure though|pg||
nt|garden2005: ja wiem, ¿e Kalita i tak by wygra³ - pochwali³em Jonssona za skrócenie rozdania i za ewentualnego impa|pg||
nt|jbennet: EW now might feel that extraordinary measures are called for.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we weren't told :(|pg||
nt|pbundy: i am guessing not............|pg||
nt|pbundy: a suggestion it might be the last hand where grue declared 2@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: (nice for declarer, i mean) :)|pg||
nt|ady: can set up the hearts    but no entry with clubs 4-2   so should make just 9 tricks|pg||
nt|boedhy:  http://www.wkbridge2011.com/en/live/scorebord-bermuda-bowl this link will work i'm told|pg||
nt|sybarra: hoi Ruud and all |pg||
nt|boedhy:  hoping to get off for 2 down or so..|pg||
nt|brolucius: This affected the draw for the KO-stage and in fact allowed England to progress to the final.|pg||
nt|bt: fredin is famous for leading aces against 3NT|pg||
mb|4H|nt|famus: tuff transportation prblms|pg||
nt|athene: probably heart lead now, ducked|pg||
nt|udo: great lead,,,,,,,amazing how often they find best lead|pg||
nt|famus: duck 100%|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: GREAT to watch such leads :)|pg||
nt|famus: dont blame NS to be in 3NT--how much they go down is moot|pg||
nt|ady: if west played 4@H  a trump lead may beat it|pg||
nt|boedhy:  sorry have to go back in 20 minutes|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: non vul so no worries really|pg||
nt|szalay: 8 of @H is mighty card|pg||
nt|xenya: well this makes -- but you need to pull out the right card each time you are on lead|pg||
nt|pbundy: it was scored as 110 - but from the play, i'd thought he'd gone down 1|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: this looks to make with no problems with the clubs working|pg||
nt|ady: clubs 4-1|pg||
nt|boedhy:  Hi Sybarra cover for me..|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: E had @h A in his hand - puts it back|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: I do not know why|pg||
nt|gracelin: there is no way to misguess on this one and Shi is a very reliable player.|pg||
nt|pbundy: WRONG prediction again here by yours truly!|pg||
mb|p|nt|anton72: in W possition I prefere to play and bid 2 NT inv + |pg||
nt|mdgraham: the jump to 4@s is optimistic, but change a couple of cards in the West hand, and put @dA onside, and it might very well have play |pg||
nt|bobholl: @C are terrible but @S are fine|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 500 here without much bother; that's fine when your game is touch and go|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes you lose 3 imps if they make the thin 4@S in the other room|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: they should know their defensive signals at this level|pg||
nt|boedhy:  not easy to see that he could play a @h back...|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i tend to think this lead would work more often than any other|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2@C was a worthwhile bid because it might allow North to complete to 3@C if he held three clubs.|pg||
nt|gracelin: anything but a spade return may see 990, with all dummy's spades going on the good clubs, after 2 round of trumps|pg||
nt|bobholl: invite and not a definitive answer|pg||
nt|brgpro: 3@D shows @h fit and @d values which sounds like music to S|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT a possibility played by North     likely to make 4@H as well|pg||
nt|brgpro: can make 5 in fact|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed - even us mortals might bid the same:)|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|skaftij:  yes|pg||
nt|bt: the thought here is that if you want to beat this kontrakt, A@H has to "work" for the defence|pg||
nt|brolucius: On a 'failed Stayman' auction, where responder looks for a major and does not find one, you should favour a major-suit lead. Don't worry that responder has a major. Worry instead ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: that declarer will be well-stocked in the minors. |pg||
nt|bt: odds changes slightly when one of the opps hands are very strong like here|pg||
nt|bt: declarer will go to dummy, take a spade finesse and aouth will eventually be squeezed down to his underpants|pg||
nt|bt: south|pg||
nt|brolucius: I have just written a book 'Winning Notrump Leads', with Taf Anthias, where we analysed (by computer) opening leads after a variety of auctions ending in NT. That was one of our ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: findings.|pg||
nt|hlortz: just give w  fewer @H and one more @C say and the lead would be a great success|pg||
nt|brolucius: After an auction of 1NT - 3NT, it is nearly always right to lead a major suit.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Even 10-x in a major is better than K-J-x-x in a minor.|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: fallenius is thinking|pg||
nt|fabsayc: better to win?|pg||
nt|brolucius: At the other table Grue led the @D4.|pg||
nt|bt: fallenius knows partner has nothing else, maybe @DJ|pg||
nt|bt: yea at the other table south was pressured on 5 diamonds|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if he ducks woolridge will eventually have the option of throwing him in with third heart|pg||
nt|brolucius: Surely South knows from the bidding that West holds @HQ-x-x.|pg||
nt|brolucius: North would not lead the ace from A-J-x-x|pg||
nt|bt: he must place partner with @DJ thats when there is a possibility to beat this|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he might but wont continue with jack|pg||
nt|runnerup: but ew seems to make 3nt also |pg||
nt|xenya: and club shift helps|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  8  deWijs playing 2@S West|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Jonsson was endplayed at trick 2|pg||
nt|szalay: right card means = pull trumps and play finesses?:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: during the pause   i think it significant to note that  all 6 USA teams advanced to KO|pg||
nt|szalay: all we know for right penalty double needs 8 of @H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and in Bermuda Bowl  4 of 6 European Teams advance|pg||
nt|szalay: 4 from 7|pg||
nt|szalay: Holland is European, I was told|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh that's right  extra team for host country|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for those with very short days this time of year   Iceland, Netherlands and Sweden all advanced|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Israel and Italy   --  i miscounted  5 of 7|pg||
nt|szalay: btw|pg||
nt|jbennet: Thet must have been aware of that they just missed a laydwon game. allowing opponents to play 4 cl making instead  of scoring +400 in 5d. |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: bertheau saying 4@d is shortness|pg||
nt|bobholl: opposite 16-18 in imps i bid it also indeed|pg||
nt|bobholl: that helps :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: a smidgeon|pg||
nt|brgpro: this lead made life easier|pg||
nt|ady: overtrick  now likely|pg||
nt|brgpro: so they played @h game from the short side, made the @C ruff impossible to find|pg||
nt|ady: would also make on other possibility  ace A@S|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes the azurri take the lead|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ady: east south Jan   making a joke|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: ahhhh -- I did not understand that :)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lml: he should make an uptrick on the lie of the cards|pg||
nt|szalay: Israel is european, as well|pg||
nt|anton72: then over Fionas 3 @s .... or 3@d ...easy can pass|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|athene: but sometimes you gain 12 when it goes off|pg||
nt|athene: those are good odds for just taking the money|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: a nie RodStroth?|pg||
nt|psyck:  You can also find live scores in this link: http://www.wkbridge2011.nl/en/live/scorebord-bermuda-bowl|pg||
nt|ady: kib suggesting 3NT  very much a gamble|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Duboin promissed 6@H, 3@S and 15+ points|pg||
nt|ady: that unfortunate for Italy|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ryskiel_: zaraz zaraz co tu siê dzieje?|pg||
nt|ady: seems K@H lead may beat it now  exceot north may later be squeezed in the minors|pg||
nt|odysseus69: not everyone will open on East which will make it tough to reach game - pass and double Norths 1nt response gets to hearts but maybe not game|pg||
nt|sybarra: one sec and will come back  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S made so Netherlands double partscore pickup on  8|pg||
nt|ady: doomed |pg||
pc|h3|nt|oosmanb: nope @h straight away!|pg||
nt|gracelin: declareris of course worried about a 4-0 trump breaks.  But he will soon find out it's not the case.|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes but he might misplay because of the "pressure"|pg||
nt|gracelin: HA is the normal play now, but declarer may think deeper|pg||
nt|roswolf: really as long as he doesnt panic this is a cinch|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would set up his side suit - as per general principles|pg||
nt|gracelin: Shi is not the man to panic.  He played the last 3 Bermuda Bowls and reached semifinal in 2009.|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes which is why Bocchi's malaise is so evident|pg||
nt|gracelin: The Chinese team beat the defending Champion Norway in the QF.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|star6ija: there are some diffivulties|pg||
nt|lechcold: mo¿e byæ:)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now spade to jack seems so normal|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 24   Hurd-Wooldridge find @D fit -- but not @S      5@DX|pg||
nt|jbennet: The only explanation why east didnt pass 4 sp with weak trumps and only 1 ace.|pg||
nt|jbennet: must have been that he hoped for a miracle.|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: well, nystrom thought that his unlimited partner made a slam try|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: maybe only needing the club cue|pg||
nt|hantveit: NS, can just push dia every time|pg||
nt|hantveit: or change to clubs now, whatever you fancy|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|athene: some might be wondering why it's so obvious for east to duck his @HA there at trick 1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  8 Aronov in 4@S|pg||
nt|ady: diamonds taken quickly anyway|pg||
nt|runnerup: without @d lead-or switch  -which is difficult|pg||
nt|ady: should be another 5 to china|pg||
nt|brgpro: this board could easily be another push|pg||
pc|h9|nt|boedhy:  @s @c ducked and @d to the 10 for 6 tricks|pg||
nt|mdgraham: difficult hand - Q10xx Axx xx Axxx and game simply depends on @dA onside, assuming trumps 2-1|pg||
nt|bobholl: n has to find @C switch now|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ady: rallying a bit|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|bt: that was strange|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|athene: if you have the ace over KQ it's just standard to duck at top level|pg||
nt|athene: it hurts declarer's transportation|pg||
nt|athene: and also helps your own|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: Upmark jest lekko wpuszczony|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: oni graj¹ w BA nie wychod w singla Wikingu|pg||
nt|lechcold: tylko odejcie kierem stwarza jaki problem|pg||
nt|panosk: double dummy ie spade lead 4@H dont make|pg||
nt|xenya: got to believe in his luck|pg||
nt|ady: still could just get the heart wrong|pg||
nt|hantveit: had to find it for -3, but would still be down with dia|pg||
pc|hA|nt|athene: now EW can cash two hearts any time west gets in|pg||
nt|athene: if east won the first trick he couldn't attack hearts any more|pg||
nt|athene: and declarer would have a sure trick and an entry|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: no right prediction this time Ruud :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: maybe the result but not the line of play|pg||
nt|pbundy: i thought he did, too - but nystrom seemed a bit minimum to me.......particularly opposite diamond shortness|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: nystrom did alert as cuebid, not specifically shortness|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ady: now give up a spade if finesse wrong |pg||
nt|ahollan1: levin-weinstein never bid where karaivanov-trendafilo wore out their red cards|pg||
nt|oosmanb: good play, since he knew K@D was the only time he'd get to dummy if A@S is with West|pg||
nt|oosmanb: @S can wait @H could not|pg||
nt|oosmanb: still some work to do!|pg||

nt|brolucius: 4@S is not a silly contract but the cards lie unluckily for N/S.|pg||
nt|bt: at the other table i think the bids were normal until north bid 4@S, @HQx is really bad on that auction|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @H & @S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=no pref|pg||
nt|ady: 11 tricks a good return in OR|pg||
nt|hantveit: looks hard to get more then 9 tricks if ew play spade and spade early|pg||
nt|bobholl: boye will lead @H i guess|pg||
mb|1H|an| |nt|athene: you would like to just bid blackwood except you might get too high|pg||
nt|brolucius: England was not fancied by the bookies, but what do they know?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in context of strong 1@C  --  1Major - 4Major is very wide range|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: god guess:)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: good|pg||
nt|hantveit: and spade in trick 2?|pg||
nt|bobholl: east wondering what's the colour of west |pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: some people play 4@D shows this sort of hand -very strong suit with support for partner|pg||
nt|athene: ok i am told 4@C asks for keycards|pg||
nt|athene: if so, north won't be taking so long :) just a matter of counting four steps|pg||
nt|athene: i think 4@C is a splinter in fact|pg||
nt|athene: and north has the well-known problem|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: N shut his eys and looks to the ceiling... thinking|pg||
nt|athene: he has some extras but his only available cue-bid goes past game|pg||
nt|lml: so can west find the diamond lead ... the @DQ|pg||
nt|lml: north should bid 4@H here|pg||
nt|lml: I wonder what 2NT would show?|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: N not convenient with partners bid, 4@h seems logical|pg||
nt|lml: I guess 19?|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: can't say, I assume so|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: pass or correct for N|pg||
nt|lml: the Canadians had a bit of a strange auction on the previous board to end in 1@S|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 3nt and 4@h should not make|pg||

nt|yuval10: the KO stage is of course an entierly different thing, and the US teams, with all their experience, will surely have some edge|pg||
nt|lml: Israel has been doing very well ... tough fighters too|pg||
nt|oosmanb: dont know if 2@S makes for NS but its close |pg||
nt|garden2005: próba ¿¹d³a|pg||
nt|roswolf: west courageously sallies forth|pg||
nt|gracelin: I think West went to far by bidding 3D, showing D plus a major, at this Vul.|pg||
nt|gracelin: too|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: sorry|pg||
nt|roswolf: aaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh|pg||
nt|ahollan1: could be opening bid with 3-fit that has no slam interest|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 1@s is limited here, hence the jump to 4@s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: as well as what standard players hold for 1-4|pg||
nt|bobholl: he simply asks him :)|pg||
mb|1N|an|0-10 with 4-4 M|nt|kit: difficult hand to handle here.  As it turns out 6 of either major makes with both majors 3-3.|pg||
nt|barnets: lucky major suit division here both 3-3|pg||
nt|ady: very favourable lay for n/s|pg||
nt|nkgupt: 3 finneses in :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ryskiel_: a w RP?|pg||
nt|boedhy:  doubleton @c helps but the good @d arent that much help|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes. The 5th trump is worth a couple of points, to compensate.|pg||
nt|brolucius: My comments are struggling to make it to the Netherlands, appearing after a time-delay of a few seconds. Perhaps someone is censoring them on the way.|pg||
nt|szalay: 3@D now, I think|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: South already passed|pg||
nt|roswolf: practical bidding|pg||
nt|ady: maybe diamond lead   free finess for a club pitch|pg||
nt|roswolf: might have been an excitinf auction the original thiugh:)|pg||
nt|gracelin: neither 3NT nor 4H makes.|pg||
nt|anton72: yes Dhondy open 1 @c 2 + cards ..and both swedish afraid from clubs :)|pg||
nt|anton72: go in 1 NT or in 2 @c|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: still, he has such a nice hand, i think he SHOULD go past game|pg||
nt|ady: nast lead for north|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: complimenting Bjarni on his average dummy putting :)|pg||
nt|antoniz: mo¿e by³o otwarcie !NT?|pg||
nt|sybarra: Brink finding 4 @C bid "amusing" |pg||
nt|olegario: Hello all, Thank you leao! olegario from Belo Horizonte, Brazil|pg||
nt|sybarra: and will W bid spades? or diamonds?|pg||
nt|ady: east may have trouble keeping trump control to bring in the diamonds|pg||
nt|ady: north considering playing the king|pg||
nt|bt: we have the same contract here, east will lead @HA and west discourage, then diamond shift|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2@H usually forcing. If so, 3@H must mean a big two-suiter (or a splinter agreeing diamonds).|pg||
nt|barnets: Israel bid to 3N in open|pg||
nt|kit: I think Weinstein should just bid 4@S and end it.|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Weinstein thinking...|pg||
nt|brgpro: so 1NT shows 7-10 both majors|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: right, so i can believe THIS is keycard|pg||
nt|ahollan1: does 1@D imply unbalanced hand?|pg||
nt|lechcold: by³o|pg||

nt|lechcold: :)|pg||
nt|lml: and we duplicate the auction in the OR|pg||
nt|yuval10: same bidding as in the OR here|pg||
nt|lml: :)|pg||
nt|lml: pretty clear to make 3 except if stansby gives a trick away on a diamond lead for an overtrick|pg||
nt|jbgood: the queen of spades was lead in the OR - and the slam made|pg||
nt|boedhy:  some sort of maximum now |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: they found a 44 fit|pg||
nt|skaftij:  EW CC does not reveal their escape methods|pg||
nt|bt: its not only that Qx is bad, its a minus value|pg||
nt|ahollan1: very few pairs have ability to show @D at 2-level over 1N opener|pg||
nt|brgpro: S will pass|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: i was wrong, it is 0-10 with 4-4 majors not 7-10|pg||
pc|d9|nt|lml: south is not going to make this|pg||
nt|star6ija: should be|pg||
nt|lechcold: a to nie sz³o|pg||
nt|leao:  they're way too high now|pg||
nt|sybarra: all of them! |pg||
nt|ahollan1: tarzan did NOT DBL 4@H on  9|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Iceland got to 4@h on bd 9, undoubled though|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Al you are too fast!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: tarzan =  wijs-muller   sounds like name of movie's tarzan from 1930s/40s  Johnny Weissmuller|pg||
nt|szalay: who was Hungarian:)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Hungarian??   i know he was olympic swimmer  but didn't know heritage|pg||
nt|szalay: we know it:)|pg||
nt|bobholl: 5@S is already a tad high|pg||
nt|brgpro: but if it is 0-6, he would pass 1@H|pg||
nt|ady: likely 9 tricks here|pg||
pc|dT|nt|famus: U bet--but these guys are creating same feelings in every team they've encountered so far:)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Lauria lays down @hs and @cs claiming 7 tricks|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: przecie¿ nie obowi¹zuje cisza wyborcza..|pg||
nt|kamyk: stary dylemat - kontrowac takie 4@C, czy nie; raz sie sobie pomo¿e, a raz im...|pg||
nt|boedhy:  4@c they wil have agreed on|pg||
nt|xenya: i'm cerrtain 3N will make on 9 in the other room|pg||
nt|brolucius: Excellent point! Yes, he needs the @DK set up before the clubs give a discard. |pg||
nt|runnerup: minor games are down with ruffs in other minor -if you has ny way to find such games|pg||
nt|dburn:  the English defenders had better be less afraid of clubs|pg||
nt|anton72: @d switch?....|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ryskiel_: grali 1 BA - 3 BA|pg||
nt|brolucius: Exactly as Lars predicted.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Mind you, East should see that it is the main chance of beating the contract (if no trump trick is available). |pg||
nt|bt: every now and then i find a diamond in the rough, right?|pg||
nt|barnets: west passed in open  same bidding|pg||
nt|brolucius: A sensible auction.|pg||
nt|kit: Somehow that West hand just doesn't look like notrump to me.|pg||
nt|hantveit: must play spade to duck, and later take spade and play dia... hard to hold it too 9|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|lechcold: 3 by³o szwole¿erskie:)|pg||
nt|leao:  hard to diagnos a double now|pg||
nt|brolucius: Also, on occasions partner would 'come again' over 4@S.|pg||
nt|roswolf: how many hcp does 2nt show 21-22?|pg||
nt|bobholl: kib's remark a good save against 5@H but i guess that's not making|pg||
pc|c5|nt|boedhy:  so maximum with @s and maybe even cue|pg||
nt|boedhy:  aiiiiii....|pg||
nt|oosmanb: on same lead?|pg||

pc|c2|nt|lml: of course hearts could have behaved better|pg||
nt|boedhy:  not good|pg||
nt|boedhy:  but Brink should go on I think|pg||
nt|boedhy:  Iceland missed it|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: indeed they did'|pg||
nt|bt: without diamond king west encourages|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: góral mo¿e przynieæ niedu¿y zysk, ale czy musi?|pg||
nt|xenya: not a contract to be in when you are late|pg||
nt|barnets: dec needed 1 major suit to break to make 3n so was fortunate|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|lml: if south had opened a strong 2@C what would have happened I wonder|pg||
nt|antoniz: czyli 2NT graæ musieli,trudno|pg||
nt|pawel90:  raczej sami bÄdziemy wistowaÄ|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: can he make it?|pg||
nt|skaftij:  1 NT showed 14-16 so W could have a minor jack |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: south in deep thought|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: cards on the table|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: back in hand now|pg||
nt|skaftij:  South has 2 entries to dummy in @c so will play towards @sAJ since East is known to have @SKQ|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and back on the table they go|pg||
nt|skaftij:  but he does not know te @c layout yet|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: cards in hand|pg||
nt|kit: exactly -- 4@S can stand some bad splits.  3NT maybe not.|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: weinstein : i am not claiming but i will show you my hand loool|pg||
nt|gracelin: 20-21, with 22-23 they open 2D and rebid 2NT.  with 23+, 2C then 2NT|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|wild card: this contract will purely depend on a heart decision|pg||
nt|antoniz: idzie 6kier,to dobrze|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 4 pasy zostaly na razie wpisane, bo w rozdaniu bylo tylko 48 kart|pg||
nt|jbgood: but in @cs always 2 club losers|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: only a @C lead lets it make..|pg||
nt|jbgood: so 17 imps for Sweden|pg||
nt|garden2005: kiwki i wolnoamerykanka ... czy tak powinnimy wygrywaæ?|pg||
nt|szalay: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Weissmuller|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hiding @D2  so that @D8 is hard to read   [upside-down attitude]|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and the israeli boys in one voice: you make everything lool |pg||
nt|roswolf: ty patrick|pg||
nt|gracelin: 2D opening can also be a weak two in either major|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer doesn't know the bad trump split yet.  He's working on how to make on 3-2 break|pg||
nt|roswolf: dont think this is ever makeable i fancy -2|pg||
nt|gracelin: The other room is commentated by Italian. They must not like what's going on.|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ahollan1: thanks  quick scan of notes made me think 1@C or 1N with all balanced hands up to 19 HCP|pg||
nt|ady: set up the long diamon   got 4 diamonds  2 hearts and 1 spade|pg||
nt|lechcold: dwie nadróbki...dobrze ¿e m³odzie amerykañska nie popêdzi³a do szlemika kierowego|pg||
nt|ady: heart now|pg||
nt|skaftij:  A @d to dummy may risk 2@h 1S and 2@d for the defense. Declarer does not like it until he sees @c situation|pg||
nt|skaftij:  but he will play a @c to dummy|pg||
nt|brgpro: maybe 10|pg||
pc|h2|nt|skaftij:  after escape method , he will infer that  @C are 4-2, west showed 4+@C-4+@H|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
nt|lml: I like a spade play now ... @SQ or jack|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 4@c maybe after 2@c opening|pg||
nt|ady: running the 9 guaranteed 7 tricks  and in the event did not cost|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: claim and toilet break|pg||
nt|ahollan1: as expected Aronov going down 2 in 4@S on  8|pg||
nt|ady: usa got 6 imps on hand 8 where Bulgaria were to high in 4@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thru 6 boards   in Bermuda Bowl  Guadalupe leads Iceland by 19 imps|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and we are back|pg||
nt|wild card: and I think it best to play the jack|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer's main line is to ruff a club and discard one on the good spade. but he also worry about D ruff|pg||
nt|roswolf: well the ether will certainly be full of hot air tinged with woe no doubt - but they are allowed a bad set sometime:)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|athene: if you had a choice of 3@S or 4@C to splinter, 3@S looks better, as partner has more room over it|pg||
nt|lml: good play|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: tough for W now|pg||
nt|rnmalik: agree.|pg||
nt|wild card: but if he plays the jack, the contract will fail, as we see|pg||
nt|wild card: N did show two aces though|pg||
nt|wild card: and if he had had a singleton hearts, he might have had a bid over 1@d|pg||
nt|rnmalik: imo it is a pure guess.|pg||
nt|wild card: looking only at the heart position, I guess it's better to play the jack|pg||
nt|wild card: wins if south has AQx in trumps|pg||
pc|s5|nt|athene: but anyway, they got there|pg||
nt|boedhy:  well done|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: its a very good one and nothing much to the play|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: so well done NL another derserved big plus|pg||
nt|boedhy:  no problems in the play so 13 imps to the netherlands...|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: very well bid by NS here|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: really "communicating" |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Iceland have been pushed down to 6th and this won't help|pg||
nt|skaftij:  clubs is only chance - he knows D finesse is wrong|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: cards back on the table|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: cards stil placed on the table and thinking...|pg||
nt|garden2005: zazwyczaj taki styl reprezntuj¹ pary, ktore maja kompleks ni¿szoci i próbuj¹ w pokerka zagraæ|pg||
nt|bobholl: one more match in 15 minutes :) have fun|pg||
pc|s6|nt|leao:  Campos will try to get tricks anyway he can now :)|pg||
nt|boedhy:  although if he tries to ruff a @c ... but the @c queen should bother him|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Iceland has a tough "program" for the day|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: has to play Israel in the last match this afternoon|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: only needs 1 @C ruff so playing trumps safe|pg||
nt|runnerup: this was down -not any more?|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: the time is almost up and 6 more boards to play|pg||
nt|nkgupt: same contract from S OR|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: mo¿e tylko 200?|pg||

nt|roswolf: they are only mortals not gods!|pg||
nt|gracelin: sure. like 2007 against S. Africa|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|xenya: S had a difficult decision to make, and he banked on 5 hearts with N -- N could have just 4, Al?|pg||
nt|ady: same 11 tricks    a push|pg||
pc|h6|nt|xenya: on any lead i guess|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: the director in the room|pg||
nt|xenya: so they will be penalised, which is good news for Japan, who are trailing NZ by 1VP|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: mr Slavek Latala|pg||
nt|dburn:  but this is setting up winners for declarer|pg||
pc|h8|nt|runnerup: he ruffed too high -so back to minus|pg||
nt|dburn:  not enough of them, fortunately, but...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: only six|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: actually lall returned @d10 earlier|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|lml: probably down 2|pg||
nt|lml: declarer has 7 top tricks and probably has to come to a black suit trick|pg||
nt|lml: a balck suit queen|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: no entries to the dummy|pg||
nt|wild card: well done robert stephens|pg||
nt|lml: nice try to set up a heart by no luck|pg||
nt|gracelin: Even God may not be able to save Madala on this 4H :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: the italian lead is only 9 and bds 23-25 have not been scored yet|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lml: Martel might rise on the club to lead a diamond through|pg||
nt|lml: makes it easier on partner|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: every team desperate to make the top 8 as we near the end of the RR|pg||
pc|h9|nt|vugraphznv: the 1@h interference by W in the other room made it more difficult|pg||
nt|mdgraham: still, Manchester City were quite happy with six yesterday |pg||
nt|anton72: i am happy for citizens too :))|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the United fans weren't..... |pg||
pc|hT|nt|ady: last hand  if the cards shown on the screen were correct then 10 tricks were there   north has discarded too many diamonds|pg||
nt|leao:  good news, the king is on side, but bad news is it's Kxxx|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Secured 1 down|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|bt: decl needs @CK onside then east doesnt have @SQ|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: They lost another 7 on board 7|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: sorry board 22|pg||
nt|gracelin: thjis culd be a huge set for China, but don't forget there are still 32 boards to go.|pg||
nt|roswolf: 38-3 to china this set after bd22 - with more imps to come|pg||
nt|roswolf: this set reminds me of the leaning tower of pisa|pg||
pc|s8|nt|lml: dont you like good partners like that|pg||
nt|bt: it wasnt magic, lol|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he is guesseing the spades because of lack of entries|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: lol|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: it seems so|pg||

nt|gracelin: But I am sure the bet station still give higher odds for Italy to win.|pg||
nt|gracelin: I woud have led S10 instead of a club.|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes but italy will be grateful there are at least 2 full sets after this one|pg||

nt|bobholl: 1 imp gain for italy (other room @C lead from west)|pg||
nt|brgpro: this should buy the contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: missing @HJ10xx you cash the single honour first because you can only pick up 4-0 break one way|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 2H both majors - popular weapon|pg||
nt|yuval10: you can read more about the Bermuda Bowl, particularely the US teams and the Israeli one too, plus expert analyzes, on www.bridgewinners.com|pg||

nt|jbgood: 6 boards to go here|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 1N=15-17  EXCEPT  1st seat favoralbe|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: if you had the 10 you would cash the honour from hand first as you can pick up Jxxx in either hand|pg||
nt|athene: japan might get their first imp there, if East in the other room leads his ace against six|pg||
nt|athene: (i am sure bocchi madala will reach six)|pg||
nt|lml: well Baxter's choice of 2@S turned out to be a good choice although perhaps south would still have bid 3NT|pg||
nt|lml: so Canada has the lead again|pg||
nt|lechcold: 3BA to Splinter karowy jak s¹dzê|pg||
nt|antoniz: splinter karowy|pg||
nt|leao:  \i expect board 24 will show a tidy profit for the Netherlands|pg||
nt|sybarra: they can beat 4 @H  but have to take their tricks  |pg||
nt|bt: now some people can bid 2@S strong on that hand, wouldnt that be nice?|pg||
nt|brolucius: In NT it is a 5-or-7 hand, depending on whether the clubs come in. 7@S much better, because you can establish the clubs against a 4-1 break.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this looks like a very biddable grand slam|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2@H now would suggest diamond support, because he is a passed hand.|pg||
nt|bt: west can splinter in diamonds, east blackwood and 5NT maybe?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 7@S needs almost nothing|pg||
nt|hlortz: ew had a rather hasty auction in OR   seems like there might be some bids between 2n and 6n imo |pg||
nt|bt: credit to the 2@H opening at the other table|pg||
nt|garden2005: przepraszam za gubienie literek, obiecujê poprawê|pg||
nt|dburn:  unclear, this - East-West at the other table got to 4@h, which they might or might not have been going to make|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that is the most brutal part about being vugraph operator -- players who don't let you see cards played|pg||
nt|pbundy: this seems like a boring one - but - with these 4 you never know!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H game force|pg||
nt|jbennet: Interesting hand if north had bid 3NT. |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: they have a discussion if Sjoert has 7 or 6 @D since they have a 2@D opening as weak with @D|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: if they can take the club finesse and make 11 in 3nt|pg||
nt|stoffers: A lot of dull boards this set|pg||
nt|odysseus69: north will be shaking but impossible to find 2Hx|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT  slight over statement    but 2NT could be much weaker in balancing seat  and very good stops in hearts   just have to play partner with enough  to make game   7 or 8 points ...|pg||
nt|ady: may do|pg||
nt|yuval10: Israel is currently being featured on the front page there|pg||

nt|xenya: 1@DX -1 might not be such a bad result for Israel |pg||
nt|oosmanb: wow nice hand|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Very nice. Easy when you see all hands, the players need to do this again and againn for days and tiredness creeps in|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: West said : only this partner|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3@D pre-emptive, of course, since he can cue-bid with a good raise.|pg||
nt|hlortz: that was a factor certainly|pg||
nt|bt: i think 4@D makes it a lot easier here|pg||
nt|runnerup: perhaps the lack of time made swedish do that little slip in defence|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: nystrom seems very fast...|pg||
nt|kit: 2@H a good 2@S raise I believe.|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 2h=9-11 3 spades|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Levin just wrote it down|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S would promise 6+|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: well, i have to guess sometimes. is an interesting game :)|pg||
pc|c9|nt|lml: I am not sure about that last result ... looked like 2 down not 1 down|pg||
nt|star6ija: I do not expect they to go further than 3N|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh oh |pg||
nt|ahollan1: hard to penalize this|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but DBL would work very well|pg||
nt|skaftij:  well the gain is only 50|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: i asked them and the claim was for 1 down, 1 also though like 2 down|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: I asked them|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C=ART FG  a) @C  b) 4@H  c) long @S|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: impodajny to ten mecz nie jest|pg||
nt|yuval10: me too Linda, those are very strong 2 teams|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: as I said earlier -- they were being beaten heavily in the test match |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Running scores > http://www.wkbridge2011.nl/nl/live/scorebord-bermuda-bowl|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, that is usually the case. 4@D does not show more than 4@S. It shows one of the reasons WHY you are worth 4@S. |pg||
nt|bt: if north bids 5@D it would have been tough|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: bertheau for sure slower than nystrom|pg||
nt|kit: 2NT probably some weak competitive hand, while a 3-level call would be constructive.|pg||
nt|brolucius: I wonder if he could have doubled to show hearts.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Seems clear to show them now.|pg||
nt|kit: maybe double shows only 4 hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: South in the tank now|pg||
nt|dburn:  but my vote would be for "not", since I can't see a tenth winner for them|pg||
nt|jbennet: BBO lead.|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ahollan1: he actually has 2 of the 3 options covered|pg||
nt|stoffers: We want action and blood :)|pg||
nt|wild card: not the first time we see a transfer on one level today|pg||
nt|ady: this might be 1 too high|pg||
nt|odysseus69: now it becomes interesting|pg||
nt|ady: only 9 obvious tricks including K@S|pg||
nt|sybarra: E may bid again and he did |pg||
nt|skaftij:  risk is losing double digit imps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry  dummy has 3@C  looked like 2 before|pg||
nt|ady: 1 too high|pg||
nt|ady: in hearts I meant|pg||
nt|roswolf: can e/w cash their tricks here|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|udo: i played against Lauria-Versace 3 or 4 times,,,when they are on a run,, u feel pressure every second|pg||
nt|athene: slam is not so bad here, if played by north to protect the @CK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D asks|pg||
nt|star6ija: 2 and a half :)|pg||
nt|antoniz: brawo Krzysztofy,piêknie i skutecznie|pg||
nt|lechcold: co siê musi udaæ, w koñcu to Mistrzostwa Swiata:)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: looks like making 10 with @S start|pg||
nt|ady: I believe the 2 heart opening shows 5 hearts and 4 spades|pg||
nt|odysseus69: can do it - spade and South must play 10 then 2nd spade (9) and can establish spade trick|pg||
nt|odysseus69: or can end play North|pg||
nt|ady: I think J@S  may be right|pg||
nt|ady: J@S    if south covers with the queen   then king    come back to east and low spade|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ady: 3NT  best spot|pg||
nt|ahollan1: :)|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: szczêliwie ju¿ po dwóch przebitkach karasi rozdanie siê koñczy|pg||

nt|olegario: ohoh now :) too high up again|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: after the lead declarer claims making 5|pg||
nt|oosmanb: 5@d makeable as the hand is|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: so no play here :)|pg||
nt|kit: I can't imagine what South could do but bid 4@H|pg||
nt|roswolf: china need to keep their foot on the italians throat - score the imps now and dont delay|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|athene: but south has the diamonds so it would have to be 6nt (or 6@S, but that is not likely)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@H=4@H    totally new concept|pg||
nt|lechcold: 3@H = 5@S-4@H|pg||
nt|yuval10: i'm very much impressed with how the Israeli team are playing here, and we must not forget it's a rather young one, most of them age nearly 40|pg||
nt|lml: there is no reason for south to pull with JX of diamonds|pg||
nt|jbgood: a slightly different auction gave more room for NS than in the OR - and may land in thispartial|pg||
nt|panosk: looks like a gd contract |pg||
nt|panosk: lead will provide 9th trick|pg||
nt|boedhy:  I can imagine why. They play solid easy bridge as we can see from these boards|pg||
nt|boedhy:  so normally the better team wins then....And I think the Netherlands are a bit better ...|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: very solid indeed|pg||
nt|szalay: boring 1 off|pg||
nt|ahollan1: early World Championships were scored Total Points|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so here  NS would be net +50 after 100 honors|pg||
nt|ahollan1: honors died when Imps came into use|pg||
nt|kit: But now I know.|pg||
nt|brolucius: How can they miss a 5-4 fit in the 'other major'?|pg||
nt|barnets: 2n clearly misunderstood|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 2nt was competitive at the 3 level|pg||
nt|kit: This is a major mixup.  South apparently thought 3@S asked for a spade stopper.  North thought 2NT then 3NT showed notrump.|pg||
nt|dburn:  still, North bid 5@d just in case either it made or 4@h would have done|pg||
nt|jbennet: banging down an ace. |pg||
pc|d3|nt|odysseus69: all reasonable plays produce a 10th trck|pg||
nt|bt: 5nt then 7@S looks easy now|pg||
nt|brolucius: Now after all the key cards are known 5NT will invite a grand and West will accept with those clubs.|pg||
nt|gracelin: they tried here, but with trumps 4-1, probably dwn.|pg||
pc|d7|nt|famus: 6NT wud be great|pg||
nt|athene: north may now offer 6@D|pg||
nt|athene: but it's tricky|pg||
nt|athene: good hand but no aces|pg||
nt|lechcold: karach:)|pg||
nt|jbgood: well - looks as if 2@h was gf...|pg||
nt|leao:  rite, if they dont take their 4 tricks kickly they wont take them at all|pg||
nt|brolucius: Even if it meant 'two places to play', it seems it was misjudged with 5 cards in the other major.|pg||
nt|roswolf: ouch not a good time to save|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this might make, if North just cashes @sAK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@D is non-serious slam try|pg||
nt|jbennet: not entirely cast-iron.|pg||
nt|pbundy: as we saw just a few boards ago, getting to the five level would make it far less boring|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 3NT over 3@s would be natural grue says|pg||
nt|pbundy: w/d by n/s not to get too high|pg||
pc|dK|nt|udo: nice bid by South,,now North shoudl accept,,, he has a clear max|pg||
nt|wild card: interesting question is, what would redouble instead of 1@s mean|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: I believe 1@s did show a 3crd|pg||
nt|wild card: and does dbl on 1@h show a takeout hand (like this), or something in hearts|pg||
nt|lechcold: bardzo ostro|pg||
nt|pawel90:  trzeba karo trafiÄ|pg||
nt|antoniz: trafi karko i super|pg||
nt|leao:  not a chance now|pg||
nt|desinka:  looks like flat board to me|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 11 tricks|pg||
nt|ady: yes|pg||
nt|desinka:  EW play kind of polish club|pg||
nt|barnets: south should have x 2@H or bid 3@H|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Shi thinks the same I think, talking chinese I think, don't understand anything|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|lechcold: podzia³ kar i trafienie palcówki potrzebne|pg||
nt|xenya: hmm|pg||
nt|lml: Matel has to pick a major with 3-3|pg||
nt|desinka:  depends from the vuln|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but i always wonder what it would be like to revive them in a duplicate setting|pg||
nt|barnets: that is clear|pg||
nt|ady: A@C lead did not cost  but continuation did|pg||
nt|ady: but contract always there|pg||
pc|s2|nt|skaftij:  Is it Ilan or Ophir who is South?|pg||
nt|brolucius: No, he has just shown the @CK. I was not expecting that.|pg||
nt|bt: now if east thinks and does bid 6@S ...|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 5NT not only asks for kings, also for a trick source which woolridge has|pg||
nt|brolucius: Makes no sense if West bids 7@S now. Why not on the previous round?|pg||
nt|bt: i thenk the us2 coach should do some work here|pg||
nt|garden2005: bêd¹ p¹czki|pg||
nt|xenya: this will also take some time -- before it goes down|pg||
pc|sA|nt|famus: swing|pg||
nt|athene: well, this might make|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and now the lead // who would lead a @c|pg||
nt|athene: lauria did not double 3@C|pg||
nt|athene: but the italians don't double these bids very often|pg||
nt|athene: so versace might still lead a club|pg||
nt|famus: i bet a @c lead|pg||
nt|udo: @C looks like he natural lead........maybe a @D|pg||
nt|athene: i think it's close between club and spade|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: he is not "that great"|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Ilan is south|pg||
nt|bt: if east thought and then bid 6@S they are toast|pg||
nt|ady: now losing 300    4 imps  instead of gaining aroound 5   still easier to decide from here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and might very well do just that, as there are no entries to dummy for the spade finesse |pg||
nt|mdgraham: now if the diamonds had been 2-2....|pg||
nt|dburn:  this isn't the clearest opening lead in the world, either|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh  then 4@D just a cue    thanks Dennis|pg||
pc|s3|nt|vugraphznv: :)|pg||
nt|udo: 13 now|pg||
nt|panosk: see how long he thinks to make sure of finding the correct plan even in a seemingly straightforward contract?|pg||
nt|roswolf: on bd 24 the chinese stayed low in 4@H AND just made it|pg||
nt|roswolf: the chinese have scored 62 unanswered imps in 6 bds|pg||
nt|dburn:  so there is some chance declarer may lose only one club|pg||
nt|jbennet: only overtricks at stake.|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|famus: might lose an imp or two here--coz the Ita wud b in 6NT if at all|pg||
nt|ady: this will likely make in spite of bad split|pg||
nt|yuval10: that won't be a big success for USA1|pg||
nt|lml: so this is how you can end in a 3-3 fit friends even when you are great players|pg||
nt|boedhy:  Against aggresive teams as India for instance yesterday you can loose because of some slem boards who happen to make|pg||
nt|runnerup: one down next -save time |pg||
nt|roswolf: however you can never write off the azurri|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ady: ok now|pg||
nt|odysseus69: all over - now 11 but he wont want to get greedy again|pg||
nt|yuval10: with the natural @h lead the contract seem like drifting at least 3|pg||
nt|xenya: W didn't know E had the @D10 when he ran|pg||
nt|lml: I like a trump lead and so does South!|pg||
nt|lml: it was a reasonable action by Stansby but it worked out badly|pg||
nt|hlortz: and 6@s must be in temo or 7S ot allowed|pg||
nt|hlortz: /tempo/|pg||
nt|brolucius: Well, they got there but no 'points for style'.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: here i dont think tempo matters since 5NT confirmed all the key cards|pg||
nt|anton72: they can give entry :) in clubs ...last one :)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|leao:  300|pg||
nt|ady: can cash the diamond now or have it later     east will finesse 10@D for 11 tricks|pg||
nt|ady: yes    may be 500   depemding on how it goes |pg||
nt|roswolf: these hands are so dipirting yo play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 24   5@DX was down 1|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ady: defence just has trump tricks|pg||
nt|boedhy:  will not make this|pg||
nt|gracelin: will be more on the 790 hand.|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|szalay: as 1 kib said: good save vs. 4@S|pg||
nt|dburn:  something like that|pg||

nt|boedhy:  So I thought today i do something different|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: then I will complement them - have never seen them play "in real life" before - but so far they have played brilliantly|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes but you cant let these guys build up a big lead -they are great front runners|pg||
nt|gracelin: the 1S bid solved West's rebid problem.  The Chinese don't raise on 3|pg||

nt|ady: minors behave for 6@C    but likely to finish in 3NT|pg||

nt|brolucius: Break or not, it is illogical to realise that 7 is there when partner signs off but not before.|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: no there was not|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Brink 2@H more constructive than 2@D["multi"]|pg||
nt|brgpro: X shows 3@s|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ahollan1: surely East runs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C probably @C and another|pg||

nt|barnets: same bidding in open passed out|pg||
nt|imp_jan: f = 128|pg||
nt|brolucius: West sees no advantage in a splinter 4@H on such a weak hand. It would give North an extra option.|pg||
nt|nkgupt: upto 9 tricks for EW|pg||
nt|jbennet: but the key to get it right of course to duck the first d, getiing a siganl from p on the 2nd |pg||
mb|d|nt|lml: west didnt bother with stayman with a 4-3-3-3 hand|pg||

nt|fabsayc: an old chess maneouvre, you repeat the position to gain thinking time|pg||

nt|hlortz: so while illogical i guess its legal if no UI|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: what would you lead|pg||
nt|xenya: not now perhaps|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: all bids are alerted of course|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the only 2-suiter NS can show is @H & @S|pg||
nt|brolucius: He had classic hand for a 4-card overcall: good values, good 4-card suit, and length in opener's suit.|pg||
nt|gracelin: north might bid 2NT to sow a good raise.  but he is stronger than that.|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznv: he looks more relaxed now|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: West you didn't. maybe something good|pg||
nt|boedhy:  ai|pg||
nt|brolucius: The Great Dealer thinks we have just ben treated to a grand slam, so we should (as a penance) watch some - usually very slow - 1NT contract. |pg||
nt|skaftij:  With 2@h contrsuctive, North should raise|pg||
nt|ahollan1: balancing 2@H  when 2@D would be more constructive|pg||
nt|brgpro: Lauris thinks he has a chance if @sK if on|pg||
pc|c3|nt|wild card: well, you already have told you're low on points, and you'll never make your hearts in a spade contract|pg||
nt|boedhy:  played too quickly there|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: sr FOLKS -- should never have complemented them -- always ends this way when I do -- SORRY |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: lucky for NL 5C was allowed to make OR|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i got it wrong 1st time  --  actually  2@D stronger than 2@H|pg||
nt|skaftij:  true|pg||
nt|kit: Levin working on the clubs, so will have some tricks if opponents draw trumps.|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|ady: some play re-double in east seat compels 2@C  which east would pass with what he had  or if a higher suit would then bid his suit |pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW have 3 ranges for 1N   at fav  1/2=9-12  3/4=11-14  otherwise 15-17|pg||
nt|odysseus69: interesting bidding in OR- having bid 2H over the double South revalued and bid 4H after 3D|pg||
nt|jbgood: fine contract for a push - he will not risk the club finesse - and three club tricks the reward|pg||
nt|ady: this could bring in some imps for Bulgaria|pg||
nt|brgpro: Lauria|pg||
nt|nkgupt: N did open a nat 1@d? :)|pg||
nt|ady: south should be able to signal which switch|pg||

nt|pbundy: he is aware they have some unfortunate results|pg||

nt|athene: will he try finessing the @S9 for a dummy entry?|pg||

nt|ady: bad situation in either minor might have meant slam going down|pg||
pc|d8|nt|udo: i see only 7 tricks actually|pg||
nt|famus: that 1 imp is becoming more illusive with each passing board--sounds like poetry!!:)|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ady: it appears west is trying to sign off but east is persisting|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm referring to 1N   not the 2@H accept of transfer|pg||
nt|nkgupt: dont think wud make even on @h continuation|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|kit: North doesn't know 4-card overcall, so he may think it necessary to tap dummy again.|pg||
nt|pbundy: so was i :)|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|athene: @SK there was safe, wasn't it? i guess not if east had @SQ109xx, but is that really possible?|pg||
nt|jbennet: as it happened also trump continuation had been enough.|pg||
nt|ady: take the 2 diamonds    then can sit back|pg||
nt|ady: no   4th spade would be a problem|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ady: tht this was glong to be played in clubs    but this will also come home|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: down now - right|pg||
nt|kit: But North got it right -- holding declarer to 3 ruffs in dummy.|pg||
nt|barnets: same def so far in open|pg||

nt|kit: Oh, Soouth overtook to play a spade.  Good play.  South knew the story.|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ehsana: hello all :)|pg||
nt|ady: spade ruff   will beat this |pg||
nt|desinka:  lucky - 6@C/6@D are almost the same in this positions of the cards|pg||
nt|ady: not down in clubs    6NT would have made as well|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: I would like 6@c a lot more|pg||
nt|desinka:  for sure|pg||
nt|bt: i think we have sweden-nz in the last round also|pg||
nt|brolucius: I usually find that it is a close decision between looking out of the window and watching a 1NT contract (but some say that this is an eccentric view).|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ady: not guaranteed    west only bid once  and did not rebid diamonds|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|lml: so probably 4|pg||
nt|lml: and likely a push or an imp in it|pg||
nt|odysseus69: wests 3D bid has received criticism from spectators- rightly so- his hand is poor defensively so shouldnt give oppo 2nd chance|pg||
pc|h3|nt|vugraphznv: a spade to the @s J|pg||
nt|athene: lauria decides to give up on the heart finesse since it might be wrong anyway and even if right, very hard to get to take it twice|pg||
nt|famus: Hi EA--can u tell us who was their coach--i forget the name??|pg||
nt|athene: even if the @S10 is onside|pg||
nt|ehsana: Kokish's  reps in Karachi|pg||
nt|famus: ah ok--ther are people looking here for those reps:))haha--joking|pg||
nt|athene: if the hearts are breaking, then it is advantageous to cash them|pg||
nt|star6ija: how he will go probably wrong|pg||
nt|ady: can make   ruff high and draw   and play on either red suit  |pg||
nt|star6ija: I think chances are greater for ruffing with the 8 here|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: fingers on the ten...not on the table|pg||
nt|ady: have to guess|pg||
nt|lml: Martel is getting his long suit going right away|pg||
nt|panosk: if spade finess doesnt work ruff another heart in dummy|pg||

pc|cK|nt|famus: with two entries it wud've fetched him more to return @hs--but Lauria does it for him|pg||
nt|ehsana: hink Lauria is giving all up|pg||
nt|athene: but if they aren't breaking, cashing them just sets up a trick or tricks for a defender|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: finesse @ss now|pg||
nt|udo: @S to 9 and still interesting|pg||

nt|mdgraham: 2@D=18-19 balanced, no 5cM|pg||
nt|jbennet: perhaps fatigue are creeping in.|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Sometimes very difficult to decide between NT and a 5-3 major fit. I usually solve the problem by always playing in the major. |pg||
nt|mdgraham: can EW hammer this?|pg||
nt|dburn:  probably not - no one can ever double anything these days|pg||

mb|p|nt|bt: i follow kantar-eisenberg on that|pg||

nt|ahollan1:  in Venice Cup    Netherlands LEADS USA1 by 1|pg||
nt|pbundy: very exciting, al!|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: they were trailing by 40 2 sets ago|pg||
nt|jbennet: this convention 1H being also nebulous.|pg||
mb|2N|an|!H|nt|athene: NS play multi - maybe he thinks that hand is too strong for weak-two but too weak for 1@S|pg||
nt|wild card: board 10, EW in the open room also bid 4@h, got a diamond lead, declarer misguessed trumps but still got home after a wrong defence|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: West asks about the time|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 20/25 min offcial|pg||

nt|dburn:  you see what I mean?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: :(|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think rebid will be    2@C=4@H  unbalanced|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: spades best for n/s   difficult to find now|pg||
nt|boedhy:  looking at it more deeply he had to choose if partner had the @c or @s ace|pg||
nt|skaftij:  the 4-1 break make 4@s difficult|pg||
nt|ahollan1: most play support DBL only thru 2@H|pg||
nt|szalay: but over 2M it shows extras|pg||
nt|pbundy: dennis - that is why i am quite often loathe to write off ANYONE in these competitions|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry missed it   2N= 4@H 6@D|pg||
nt|pbundy: matches can swing by a lot without tons of boards to go|pg||
nt|jbennet: might work when you sit and home and bid hands as pracitse with no opponents|pg||
nt|jbennet: east probed for game  with 2 sp and then respected his p decision. |pg||
nt|brgpro: will stop in 4 i bet|pg||
nt|roswolf: thiws might well be bid|pg||
nt|jbennet: west might well try a splinter bid.|pg||
nt|ady: 2NT good hearts|pg||
nt|jbennet: or show his 2nd suit , |pg||
nt|brgpro: 4@d is at pd's throat...hard to judg, i think 3@c is perhaps his choice|pg||
nt|bobholl: it is a 50% slam so :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: maybe 4@D if that splinter is allowed in the system|pg||
nt|jbennet: to show 2nd suit not a bad idea at all, he might get a good flop. 3235 or 4234 with suitable cards|pg||
mb|3S|an| |nt|rnmalik: Part of the game:)|pg||
nt|lml: on the lie of the cards e-w can do pretty well in a minor|pg||
nt|xenya: much depends on how NS treat this sequence...|pg||
nt|lml: but no way to know that|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Jorgs bidding doesnt match their CC|pg||
nt|skaftij:  2NT = FG raise|pg||
nt|brgpro: think he will introduce his 2nd suit|pg||
nt|bobholl: guess that tarzan will get to 4@H|pg||
nt|jbennet: yes totally agree, 4d leaves no room for p.|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: or maybe he just thinks his spades are not good enough for a weak-two|pg||
nt|athene: i bet bocchi is not so demure|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: seems a cross ruff game here|pg||
nt|lml: the problem is that the defence is overrruffing|pg||
nt|lml: he has five top tricks so he needs to make 3 little diamonds|pg||
nt|lml: he can make a ruff of a small club|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: hard to do so with this layout|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  11  Stefanov in 4@H on the Moysian|pg||
nt|star6ija: actually declarer after correct guess in @ss has to keep all his @ds in dummy|pg||
nt|xenya: and it appears 3@S was just a signoff|pg||
nt|bt: so if u have like 26 hcp and 53, get to the major, u need the extra ruff|pg||
nt|ady: 3@S?|pg||
nt|brgpro: rather than a crowded 4@d|pg||
nt|brgpro: 3@s=@c|pg||
mb|4H|nt|vugraphznv: I wrote what Jorgensen wrote to N|pg||
nt|skaftij:  4@d void probably|pg||
nt|bt: with 28 or more get to nt|pg||
nt|brolucius: Also, there is no threat of an adverse ruff in NT, of course.|pg||
nt|bt: at least thats my interpretation of how they played, must ask them|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 1@S according to cc is GI-relay [15]|pg||
nt|barnets: USA building a strong lead - now by 38|pg||
nt|brolucius: As often happens, we are assigned a penance of 1NT after an exciting board.|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes regaining your composure is necessary once you have been through the wringer|pg||
mb|p|nt|pawel90:  5@D byÅo tanie|pg||
nt|sybarra: has a bit to handle however |pg||
nt|leao:  6 even, without  @d lead |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: of course and that is what he has :)|pg||
nt|boedhy:  will not make this...|pg||
nt|boedhy:  have to go have fun all|pg||
nt|skaftij:  running scores |pg||
nt|skaftij:  http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Microsite/RunningScores/ASP/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?redirect=1&qtournid=881|pg||
nt|runnerup: now @d lead needed|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Jonsson asked if he has to much|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Baldursson answer is: yes|pg||
nt|barnets: north in closed room made an imiganative bid of 4@C over 1N rebid|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is easy for text-books to tell us not to allow a bad board to affect our subsequent play. This advice is all too difficult to follow, as we have seen here.|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: they are laughing about the lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: more from Venice Cup  USA2 trailing Indonesia by 21|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that match is on BBO |pg||
nt|jbennet: in real life with agressive opponents however: The subsequent bidding may be ruined. |pg||
mb|p|nt|wild card: south apparently wants to know whether to play 3NT or 4@s, and that's an easy decision for north|pg||
nt|lml: a spade lead will not be helpful to the defense|pg||
nt|oosmanb: @c ruffs would give alot of defensive tricks.. 2 ruffs A@H A@S 2@D|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no i dont know what that means :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am told by a kibitzer that a recent analysis showed (in world championship play) that 3NT played better than four of a major when the hands are balanced. He says that Glyn ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: Liggins (of England) was the author. |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: they have 25 minutes left|pg||
nt|brolucius: I have not read it, but it would be interesting to see.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: on this hand south has no reason to play 4@H for sure|pg||
nt|kit: jack of spades lead a thoughtful shot -- but not for this hand. |pg||
mb|p|nt|panosk: tough contract lets see how he deals with it|pg||
nt|panosk: prefer semi forcing 2@D with W hand|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: bye Ruud and thanks from all of us'|pg||
nt|jillan:  interesting results so far in the Venice Cup BOT American teams are down. USA 2 against Indonesia 198/219. USA 1 against Netherlands 171/172|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Indonesia just picked up more  leading by 34|pg||
nt|jbennet: this time south decidednot to overcall 1 sp (clearcut).|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the round robin  1) USA2  2) USA1   so these are big upsets|pg||
nt|jbennet: giving EW room to scientifically find out that 6h was there for taking. |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: players not explaining, so i can't tell you what 3@d or 3@h means|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 25  [5@SE-1]   Wooldridge in 4@S|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: probably bertheau is relaying|pg||
nt|roswolf: never close to the slam|pg||
nt|bobholl: pity that the position of @C A decides and not judgement / technic|pg||
pc|s2|nt|rnmalik: Natural 4@S but appears difficult to make on J@D lead.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3C for 5 card major|pg||
nt|leao:  yes, he has a bit of work to do|pg||
nt|sybarra: only 6 with j10 of spades dropping|pg||
nt|leao:  rite|pg||
nt|leao:  @d and @d?|pg||
nt|bt: i also never look for a major w 4333, its just so i dont waste my energy deciding or give up information |pg||
nt|runnerup: @s lead |pg||
nt|ahollan1: we're only 5 boards ahead of the other table    almost always happen for Grue-Lall|pg||
nt|brgpro: 3@c by W would have been @d|pg||
nt|brgpro: so 3@s=@c|pg||
nt|brgpro: i was told|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ady: think this will end in game|pg||
nt|ady: not slam|pg||
nt|mdgraham: EW have a Note 3 defining continuations after 2@D, but there's not much I can see about what they do after interference  |pg||
nt|dburn:  still, this isn't down yet|pg||
nt|dburn:  if if South gives North a ruff it will be, but otherwise there are chances|pg||
nt|ahollan1: typically  relays get  exact distribution then total controls [A=2 K=1]  or for this pair  zz points  A=3 K=2 Q=1|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: nystrom writes 3@s = 'i think 1462' |pg||
pc|s9|nt|wild card: 3@h conventional, I've seen Americans do that before|pg||
nt|wild card: with both @dA and @cK offside, he will go down|pg||
nt|wild card: and 3NT might be made|pg||
nt|brolucius: It seems to imply that responder should bid Stayman (rather than make a transfer bid) when he is 5-3-3-2 with a 5-card major and sound game values. |pg||
nt|barnets: south is still thinking what that means|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|ady: could go wrong   |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: score board 28 corrected...|pg||
nt|odysseus69: has to rise with spade ace after d finesse loses|pg||
nt|ady: then play for K@C with north|pg||
nt|ady: if he plays clubs now and north wins and plays a 2nd spade  will again have to play the ace|pg||
nt|odysseus69: much debate - should he play clubs or diamonds|pg||
nt|ady: diamond finesse now looks normal|pg||
nt|ady: club can wait|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Zack shaking his head.. perhaps thinking about board 25?|pg||
nt|ady: good duck of spade from south|pg||
nt|leao:  nope|pg||
nt|ady: looks good for 10 tricks|pg||
nt|chick:  and the Venice Cup for those interested:   http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Microsite/RunningScores/ASP/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?redirect=1&qtournid=882|pg||
nt|andersk: well I do not lead @H A|pg||
pc|c7|nt|lechcold: ten Grue jest bardzo grony|pg||
nt|sybarra: but not a slam "we" want to be in |pg||
nt|andersk: 4 sp makes|pg||
pc|c4|nt|vugraphznv: it did|pg||
nt|jbgood: so one imp for Sweden most likely|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: he did not play|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  11  [3@C S -1]  Muller in 4@S east|pg||
nt|barnets: by a pssed hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Lall DBL  must made Bertheau's hand HUGE|pg||
nt|jbennet: south probably judged that they were ahead enough in this match. |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: bertheau was telling the same|pg||
nt|jbennet: so the otherwise normal overcall of 1 sp  was not necessary. |pg||
nt|ahollan1: from what i've seen on vugraph   DBLs during relay sequences are huge LOSER|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL  not only gives relayers info about opp hands   but  worse  gives them extra space|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: USA picked up 12 imps on 25, as did the dutch women in their match against usa2|pg||
pc|cK|nt|lml: he is trying for the crossruff but it wont work for him|pg||
nt|leao:  lol... agree|pg||
nt|brolucius: Few people do that, though.|pg||
nt|hlortz: south has both xtra high cards and no aces - that points me to 3n also|pg||
nt|bt: so 3nt was slam invitaional presumably|pg||
nt|mdgraham: although if partner has defined a balanced 18-19, double can be used as penalty - but maybe that's hopelessly old-fashioned|pg||
nt|dburn:  although if North forces dummy with a diamond, there will be too much for declarer to do|pg||
nt|dburn:  not that diamond, mind you - but West may not believe that she can run it|pg||
nt|mdgraham: why @DK? North won't lead from @DAQ - and the ace might be singleton  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: board 32 is final board of the match -- actually it is board 96|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: against usa1, that was|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|ady: west might have pushed with 5@C   and taken a view if east cu 5@D|pg||
nt|wild card: he can discard 3 clubs now|pg||
nt|wild card: but after @d10, I doubt he will depend on the heart finesse|pg||
nt|lechcold: przepraszam, priv:) ale Joe Grue, naprawdê jest grony|pg||
nt|kit: Not that anything else is particularly better.|pg||
nt|roswolf: an overtrick is on here|pg||
nt|brgpro: side suit|pg||
nt|jbennet: so west did indeed show 2nd suit. Surprsingly east bid only bid 4h. |pg||
pc|c2|nt|jbgood: but not when W didnt cach the club ...|pg||
nt|bt: hurd has no clear lead here, i would try that too|pg||
nt|bt: i dont think this auction makes ducking @DA a difficult play|pg||
nt|nkgupt: 3@s-4@d(if cue) W might have givenn one more try|pg||
pc|c6|nt|leao:  goig for the forcing defense|pg||
nt|sybarra: may end up making only 5 |pg||
nt|leao:  well, he's in 4, so no problem|pg||
nt|boedhy:  hi all back|pg||
nt|sybarra: re hi Ruud |pg||
nt|boedhy:  not much imps going on i see|pg||
nt|boedhy:  board 24 only|pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 24  |pg||
nt|leao:  ruff, @d to dummy and @d back.... if W ruffs, he'll be ruffing pards trick|pg||
nt|boedhy:  yes that was a extreme result|pg||
nt|leao:  yes, Miguel felt the urge to show pard he had @h as well, instead of leading pards suit|pg||
nt|sybarra: are we losing connection or is Bas thinking?|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: bas is thinking|pg||
nt|leao:  looks like hes thinking|pg||
nt|olegario: sure now trying for an extra trick which may not happen|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe not after 4-1 trump split|pg||
nt|mdgraham: although Norht might have pre-empted with seven diamonds|pg||
nt|dburn:  now, declarer will do well to get out for down one|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ady: premature Q@C|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3NT much easier - if I had 5 card Stayman would I use it? dont tink so|pg||
nt|fabsayc: you mean so you dont have to lead?|pg||
nt|runnerup: i just cant see that north has any rigth to bid to 3 @c -but he did (i think south agrees)|pg||
nt|xenya: can make by setting up hearts|pg||
nt|skaftij:  ith 3-2 spades 4 spades also off after 3 rounds of diamonds|pg||
nt|barnets: 5@C is final contract|pg||
nt|brolucius: There are four more sessions of 16 boards, so there is no need to push hard after a couple of bad boards.|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: jakby dali graæ|pg||
nt|panosk: hoping for spades 3-3|pg||
nt|andersk: now even easier|pg||
nt|brolucius: Why is ducking something that West should consider?|pg||

nt|vugraphznv: 2@d= 5@s5@h|pg||
nt|ahollan1: inverted 2@D    |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: [sorry  or unbal 5+@C 15+ HCP]   1@H=4+@S|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Bulgaria need the points much more than Israel who were 3rd over night|pg||
nt|ady: no good fit for n/s   heading for 3NT   |pg||
nt|ady: not wild about overcall   |pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@s only one down?|pg||
mb|2S|an|16+|nt|ritong: not mentioning @h Kxx, always a small problem to hold Hxx in other major|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but i forgot Martel was allowed to bid|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT  making here n/s|pg||
nt|panosk: if you cancell out 2 slams one gained and one lost for each team the vast majority of imps were scored by part scores|pg||
nt|boedhy:  Not goo dfor Brasil tho who should imo be possible to end up in the top 8 is getting difficult |pg||
nt|ady: 3@C  must show diamonds|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 3@c is a transfer to 3@d|pg||
nt|ady: 10 tricks in diamonds|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H a possibilty for n/s|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 5@C the limit for EW|pg||
nt|xenya: as expected, 3N on 9 was made in the OR -- 10 imps to Italy|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Dubion had PASS out of the box more than once - and chooses to stay with it|pg||
nt|bardo: no il +1 non c'è stato|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is good to see that there are some hands where 2@H is opened on both sides of the Atlantic.|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would bid 1nt on west's hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: wouldnt stop north bidding but would give pard some info|pg||
nt|gracelin: he set up a trap.|pg||
nt|roswolf: south may pass here?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@H is obstructive|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: ok, NS system in the other room put west on lead against the slam, so japan didn't get their imp |pg||
nt|brolucius: East OK for a diamond pre-empt, as I see it. No need to worry about a big heart fit because N/S would then have a big spade fit.|pg||
nt|barnets: he has a ruffing finesse in spades|pg||
mb|3D|nt|skaftij:  But not likely to go beyond 2@s|pg||
nt|leao:  NS have 4@s|pg||
nt|leao:  and EW do not have 4@h|pg||
nt|bt: ew overcompeted here in the other room|pg||
nt|roswolf: the trap wasnt sprung|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, Madala made a discipline pass.|pg||
nt|pbundy: this would be my lead here, too :)|pg||
nt|jbennet: looks like +140.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: interesting|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Play in @h. low to 8 first |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Zero leads|pg||
nt|ady: is 1@D forcing?|pg||
nt|roswolf: west will be a bit jaundiced|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: the cards lie very well for north-south|pg||
nt|ehsana: DBL was nota good option ??|pg||
nt|wild card: this will probably force p to bid 4@s, he will ask for keycards|pg||
nt|yuval10: the logic is to enable partner to bid with a big hand and /or 2 suiter hand in which he doesn't open 2@c with |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: West: I hop I don't have to much|pg||
nt|panosk: * Israel sorry|pg||
nt|skaftij:  When entering dummy second time, run the 10|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: will west offer notrumps, or just bash in 4@S?|pg||
nt|athene: he surely must bid SOME game, with a good 17 count facing drury|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: why not?|pg||
nt|athene: versace going for singleton heart with his partner and an immediate knockout|pg||
nt|ady: would need a club ruff to beat 4@H   but n/s not in the bidding|pg||
nt|bt: this is the type of auctions where north has to base his action on south having some values, like 6-7 hcp|pg||
nt|brolucius: Look at the Open Room bidding, by putting your cursor on the Open Room result (top left). East broke a fundamental rule of bidding by going to 4@H, He had made a limit bid and knew ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: little of what partner held.|pg||
nt|skaftij:  hmm|pg||
nt|kit: Weinstein would have some chances if Levin's ace of hearts were ace of diamonds.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Playing 'ace for attitude, king for count' leads, North could lead the @SK to ask partner to unblock any honor he might hold, otherwise to give count. This would allow North to ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: judge if the @SQ was falling from West.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: confession    i would lead @D|pg||
nt|jbennet: and now a possible +200.|pg||
nt|roswolf: they will have been in worse partscores|pg||
nt|ady: west should tell his partner not to be concerned for overtricks|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ahollan1: curiously  most tables will have identical auction even though very different inferences|pg||
nt|star6ija: have to go now , see you at 4:45 CET for the next Bulgaria's hard fight agains Poland|pg||
nt|star6ija: bye|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: bye|pg||
nt|ady: bye|pg||
nt|ady: need to take some care here   defenders each had a side suit singleton|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: cards on the table..thinking|pg||
nt|kamyk: ale by³ to sensowny plan - krótki @DK u wchodz¹cego|pg||
nt|lechcold: dziwna gra|pg||
nt|yuval10: and in worst case you play 2NT with the points equal between both sides|pg||
nt|sybarra: does Campos sit?|pg||
nt|sybarra: nope |pg||
nt|szalay: I think weak openings survive cause weak overcall is coming|pg||
nt|skaftij:  lost opportunity for Iceland|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i've only ruled out @H lead|pg||
nt|kit: North does have a problem here -- but as the hand is, anything but king of spades defeats the contract.|pg||
nt|ady: north surprise at 2NT with what he has in spades|pg||
nt|roswolf: some good some bad and some indifferent bridge but boy very exciting too|pg||
nt|nkgupt: italy likely to loose a few on this one|pg||
nt|bobholl: hope sjoert won't guess to lead a @S|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|jbennet: will defenders kan take all their 6 tricks?. |pg||
pc|c2|nt|skaftij:  this can be defeated with 3x @s after takin @cs|pg||
nt|boedhy:  so south didnt bid anything yet (thats a first) and his partner bids 4@s and he has thid hand....|pg||
nt|ahollan1: trump makes a lot of sense |pg||
nt|skaftij:  good lead|pg||
nt|xenya: and a lot of tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: especially with West showing at least invitational strength|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@d=good raise to 2@h, as they are playing transfers after the double |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: they do, both explained it as good @H raise|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so East may well bid 4@h now, knowing the good fit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and then NS may save....|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 4@D sounds strange to me... what should it mean, cant be to prepare a sac against 4@S since you would pass 3 probably...|pg||
nt|dburn:  4@d shows diamonds|pg||
nt|dburn:  and offers a possible contract|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: yes but why would you do?|pg||
nt|dburn:  I know there are very few bids in the modern game, but this is one of them|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: might|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that's revolutionary, 4@D showing diamonds|pg||
pc|cK|nt|famus: i think it was the right thing to do|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, and @h K might be a falsecard with KJx|pg||
nt|ehsana: 4S has a chnace now|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and declarer will make this one - is my guess|pg||
nt|ady: another chance for Bulgaria|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3S shows 4S and 5H - Smolen is what I thnk its called|pg||
nt|leao:  no 5@s with d lead|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: evryone is saying 6@C on the major squeeze|pg||
nt|skaftij:  that will take care of (A)Qxx in North|pg||
nt|brolucius: He could hardly hope to shut out a spade fit if North/South held one.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think he can make this but is not easy|pg||
nt|runnerup: so he took @s finess after all|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|skaftij:  At last some action :-)|pg||
nt|lml: the problem here is getting to the 1 point hand|pg||
nt|yuval10: also of course it makes life tougher for opps|pg||
nt|barnets: so fleishers imagination brought in 10 more tricks for usa|pg||
nt|barnets: 10 more imps |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 51-5 this set|pg||
nt|barnets: i meant|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: big set for the americans|pg||
nt|barnets: fleisher Kamil were very effective in round robinthird in Butler scoring|pg||
nt|brolucius: North might instead have led the @S10, since he expected West to hold a spade stopper and the lower lead might work well when South held only two spades.|pg||
nt|grebrof: even 2@s could have been 3@s, but the suit is kinda thin and maybe even short nowadays when you dbl with any opening hand|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so game missed :(|pg||
nt|bobholl: well this is the best lead for that|pg||
pc|cA|nt|xenya: can be made on this lead|pg||
nt|lml: once they didnt lead hearts it can be made if you guess all|pg||
nt|yuval10: he just play A@s and J@s|pg||
nt|lml: you need to tap the dummy at trick two|pg||
nt|ady: n/s do have 10 tricks in clubs|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|athene: east a little worried about diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: @CK lead not all that appealing on this auction|pg||
nt|athene: west likely to have a strong notrump sort of hand; it could easily cost|pg||
pc|c6|nt|odysseus69: new leader|pg||
nt|yuval10: of course easier said than done|pg||
nt|kit: Weinstein works out that there is no miracle layout, so sets up his diamond trick to minimize the damage.|pg||
nt|barnets: the butler scoring scores your result with every other pair playing in opposite direction|pg||
nt|ady: 10 tricks|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|ady: 1 top trump helps|pg||
nt|lechcold: 130 i -2 impy|pg||
nt|leao:  best decision. shug go 2 off|pg||
nt|boedhy:  ah finally he bids|pg||
nt|barnets: and gives a rough idea how each pair is playing|pg||
pc|c4|nt|wild card: probably he wasn't considering anything else than 6@s, but east had some questions about the auction or kept the tray for a couple of seconds|pg||
nt|rnmalik: No play, can cash a @C otherwise make 7.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: trump lead is very appealing on this bidding so duboin might play north for the @SQ from the failure to lead a trump|pg||
nt|ady: west not leading a heart as north had shown 5 hearts  4 spades and a game going hand with 3@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm told that Brink is allergic to PASS cards|pg||
pc|cT|nt|famus: is he going to hook @s straight away?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: unfortunately the bidding didn't help them diagnose the obvious squeeze :) 1 to me|pg||
nt|xenya: i can't make out NS's auction at all|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: looks like  11  Stefanov may actually make 4@H in the Moysian fit|pg||
nt|ady: small trump best|pg||
nt|odysseus69: look it up - i will ask|pg||
nt|ady: but e/w have the same in diamonds|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in college systems were invented to ensure i was on opening lead|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ady: cant see how that helps defence|pg||
nt|lechcold: zarówno 1BA jak i pas na 1BA jako mi siê nie podobaj¹:(|pg||
nt|boedhy:  think 5@s is makeable...|pg||
nt|sybarra: club club  maybe|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West will not be pleased with this, I think - but they will score more than if they defended 4@sx  |pg||
pc|d9|nt|athene: on the other hand the threat of a club ruff might make him just bash out @SAK|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Now, it be even go 2 down|pg||
nt|skaftij:  East will surely ditch a @h|pg||
nt|odysseus69: what is the range of 1NT - 14-16 i guess but sure to find out in a moment|pg||
nt|ady: 11 in OR     maybe an extra heart as they lay|pg||
pc|d8|nt|leao:  not with @d lead and @h back :)|pg||
nt|boedhy:  they cannt get there @d tricks|pg||
nt|bt: are the nz team allowed to do that "haka" before their matches? seems like they did against usa1|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|ady: best for declarer to play 2nd round of clubs from east hand|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: in the tank now|pg||
nt|ady: of course we can see that   easier|pg||
nt|skaftij:  2 times @c|pg||
nt|brolucius: I remember someone sending me a message saying that it was ridiculously unfair on the players for the Butler ranking to be published. Amazing view. |pg||
pc|d7|nt|pawel90:  1BA pokazuje bilans przynajmniej|pg||
nt|lechcold: aczkolwiek mo¿na znaleæ uzasadnienie dla obu odzywek..|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Seems that goes for Drijver as well|pg||
nt|roswolf: AH THANK YOU for the implied compliment - Plato the Phiosopher|pg||
nt|roswolf: a solid result for the azurri|pg||
nt|roswolf: probably:)|pg||
pc|dT|pc|h2|nt|odysseus69: 14-16 confirmed|pg||
nt|panosk: eventually will play diamonds and that is his problem, how to?|pg||
nt|leao:  if he goes for a xruff he may go -1 only|pg||
nt|leao:  rite... always -2|pg||
nt|gracelin: The turbulance seems to be over for he Italians.  They start to play solid bridge with sound judgment as usual.|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: he needed to float @S to make  but hard to picture Martel's shape|pg||
nt|ady: ruff a heart  then a@C and a club|pg||
nt|lml: this is a very sensible line|pg||
nt|yuval10: and naturally you play AK@s and go down|pg||
nt|xenya: wrong...|pg||
nt|ritong: :)|pg||
nt|barnets: maybe that was fro a player who was performing poorly|pg||
nt|brolucius: Might as well say that you should not announce the football results if a team has lost by more than four goals.|pg||
nt|ady: now 11|pg||
nt|brgpro: interesting rebid after a prec 1@c and 1@d response from pd in OR. will E pass on that?|pg||
nt|bobholl: 2 @D is also ok with me :)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ryskiel_: czy kto mo¿e zna termin V Kolumna...to co z wojny hiszpañskiej w 36 roku|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ady: yes I believe in smollen  3@H  after stayman and 2 diamond response would have been the same   but not game forcing?|pg||
nt|lml: it just doesnt work|pg||
nt|barnets: :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: need to play well in the next 2 sets|pg||
nt|roswolf: do the dutch wear clogs when they are happy?|pg||
pc|hT|nt|kit: Of course for the Butler there is some luck involving which pairs you play against, but for the most part the luck evens out and it is a pretty good representation of how things ...|pg||
nt|kit: went at your table.|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|brolucius: Very good, Lars.|pg||
nt|jbennet: but probably it will still be 140|pg||
pc|d6|nt|athene: he has to duck to preserve the entry to the fourth club|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: signaling is asked by N now to E|pg||
nt|ehsana: better this way on this holding|pg||
pc|dK|pc|s4|nt|athene: in the other room bocchi-madala DID play 6@D|pg||
nt|athene: and DID get a club lead|pg||
nt|athene: but|pg||
nt|athene: their system meant north was declarer|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|ady: now definately should get club right|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but still going down, isn't he?|pg||
nt|ady: but should not have cashed the diamond|pg||
nt|ahollan1: must lose 2@C and 1@S |pg||
nt|ady: a@C  and club before the K@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and NS already have 1 trick|pg||
nt|rialc2: vedo che, praticamente, ci sono state solo manche (da ciò lo score "perfetto")|pg||
nt|skaftij:  on bd 29, Baldursson in 5@s, let rge @d lead run to 9 so 11 or 12 tricks|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|athene: but now the defence get the @DK set up too fast|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or stansby scores @S & @D|pg||
pc|c9|nt|jbennet: right guess?|pg||
pc|h7|nt|famus: doesnt show on the scoreboard?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: fine defense|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just forgot to DBL|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|xenya: or do they just bid their 5-card suits and raise on 3 -- still that doesn't account for N's final raise|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Does not make sense that 2@s should be forcing if 2@d is strong|pg||
nt|skaftij:  so South should just pass|pg||
nt|roswolf: they are putting the boot in here|pg||
nt|ady: 26 imps swing on position of A@C  hand 13|pg||
nt|roswolf: :):)|pg||
nt|jbennet: in fact the heart switch could have costed a trick had declarer finessed.|pg||
pc|d5|nt|brolucius: It is true that the '3rd pair' in a team may play only against the weaker opponents and get an unmerited boost to their score. But that doesn't matter much to anyone.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: how do you think he does it?    i don't know|pg||
pc|s5|nt|athene: he is just hoping for 3-3 hearts now|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s2|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|kiwibridge: Muller in 5@C OR no swing|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h6|nt|ady: I am told 3@H would be forcing to game   but 5 spades and 4 hearts|pg||
nt|odysseus69: David i dont think we qualify as expperts on Smollen|pg||

pc|cA|nt|wild card: 5@d needs attentive declarer play|pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: Do zwrotu 2@H@H i@C...|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: He is showing 2 suits, but couldn't read which one is specified|pg||
nt|ady: keep out now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: everybody recognizes Pinball Wizard|pg||
nt|nkgupt: that time better to count the eggs i suppose|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: but you know the dutch saying :)|pg||
nt|jbennet: so on this board the numer of tricks changed froma start defender 6: declarer 7: after the heart play from west defenders: 5 declarer:8.|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ritong: opening 1NT has other virtues than showing 15/17|pg||
nt|ady: too high e/w|pg||
nt|ady: 11 tricks for n/s in hearts   though e/w have a good save in spades|pg||
nt|xenya: or S|pg||
nt|bt: well he better take it oout then|pg||
nt|brolucius: North showed spades, so East had a 1@S bid for take-out. Double would mean something else.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|vugraphznv: Tournament Director has arrived and tells they have 10 minutes left|pg||
nt|davidstern: Keep sell and see you soon|pg||
nt|xenya: bye David, thanks :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: mb|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|pawel90:  ja muszÄ lecieÄ, dziekuje wszystkim|pg||
nt|lechcold: 3@C to podwy¿szony Puppet Stayman chyba|pg||
nt|kamyk: 3@C to pewnie pytanie o st, pi¹tkê|pg||
nt|antoniz: tak|pg||
nt|kit: But normal 4@S contract reached, and with no bad splits appears to make easily.|pg||
nt|brolucius: 40 years ago, or so, it was thought ungentlemanly to give the name of the declarer if he had made a stupid play and done down. Also ridiculous. Continuing the football analogy, can ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: you imagine the Times reporting that 'one of the Arsenal players missed a penalty in the 52nd minute'?|pg||
nt|kit: well, if I'm writing up a match and somebody makes a bad play, the world will know exactly who.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think Mike Lawrence in seminal book of Overcalls was first to suggest IN WRITING   situational strength of jump overcalls|pg||
nt|brgpro: just learned!|pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: 10 tricks claimed very shortly |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: a normal 3nt|pg||
nt|skaftij:  good sacrifice|pg||
nt|lechcold: prawie na jedno wychodzi:)|pg||
nt|leao:  this shud make and be flat|pg||
nt|boedhy:  thats true but then again it depends were you stand |pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe even I could make this one|pg||
nt|brolucius: I suppose the writer did not want his own mistakes written up later.|pg||
nt|brolucius: North's double is a take-out double and South has the usualy two duties: to choose a trump suit (or NT) and to show the strength of his hand. Here 2@S would not show his extra ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: strength. |pg||
nt|ady: ended quietly|pg||
nt|gracelin: trump lead?|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes they punt the game regardless|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer can work on either clubs or diamonds as both suits break favorably for declarer.|pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks ok with the even breaks|pg||
pc|s5|nt|lml: do you like bypassing diamonds|pg||
nt|lml: it did work to get them a diamond lead|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: lead is asked @d 6|pg||
nt|athene: it's definitely not a bad 15 count|pg||
nt|wild card: I guess he'll lead Q of @c|pg||
nt|ady: need A@D right     predictably both rooms in game|pg||
nt|yuval10: running scores :  http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Microsite/RunningScores/ASP/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?redirect=1&qtournid=881|pg||
nt|brolucius: South's double will be a Support Double, showing 3-card support for partner's spades.|pg||
nt|bt: wow usa clearly wants to choose sweden|pg||
nt|barnets: I think that is right - some writers go out there way not to though|pg||
nt|gracelin: Italy got one swing by making 4H on the hand Bocchi shift to D to set it.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: opening bids are getting lighter|pg||
pc|s2|nt|wild card: plenty of time to shift to a heart later on|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Q alright but @D:)|pg||
nt|ady: -300 in 4@S    dont thin n/s can be sure of 5@H|pg||
nt|ady: they have taken the push|pg||
nt|runnerup: do more + for Sw..|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|ady: north pened a tactical lead direct 1 spade in 3rd seat to get the right lead if defending|pg||
nt|odysseus69: in OR South found a response to 1H - there is an old system called Acol- where 2H opener shows 8 or more tricks|pg||
nt|yuval10: a touch-and-go game, the Q@s makes this contract an excellent one|pg||
nt|brolucius: E/W have found their club fit.|pg||
nt|bt: that 1@S takeout was just horrendous and his poor partner has to play it|pg||
nt|jbennet: what a shot from south.|pg||
nt|jbennet: positive thinking.|pg||
nt|jbennet: and it will probably make,too.|pg||
pc|s9|nt|lml: ducked it ... cool|pg||
nt|ehsana: 2H shows 4spades|pg||
nt|ritong: that too|pg||
nt|udo: style is to upgrade much more often than the other way|pg||
nt|athene: three aces and the @H10 makes up for 4333|pg||
nt|leao:  if i can, u surely can :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 6nt looks cold|pg||
nt|skaftij:  kibs point out that AQxx cannot be handled |pg||
nt|skaftij:  EW play "HÃ¤xan"|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: east in the tank|pg||
nt|skaftij:  West has shown about 15-17|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: stil thinking|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Haraldsson will be reluctant|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: they bid it in the open room|pg||
nt|skaftij:  otoh, they bid agressively|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: east is stil in the tank|pg||
nt|skaftij:  With 12-14 and @c, West would bid 2@c and revert to 2@h over 2@d I think|pg||
nt|ritong: thank you, pard|pg||
nt|bt: thing is we all make horrendous mistakes but it is partnerpreserving to play them yourself|pg||
nt|brolucius: East could not really hope to win the auction to good effect when his partner could not speak over 1@C. So, wiser to pass.|pg||
nt|bt: not only is woolridge upset over his partners bids, he also have to play a really awful contract|pg||
nt|brolucius: East is expecting better clubs opposite because he asked partner to choose between the red suits.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he could have doubled 1@H to get in the auction safely 1@S should have good shape including clubs on actual auction|pg||
nt|szalay: bald is very agressive today|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H denied 4-fit|pg||
nt|roswolf: TRUMP LEAD as expected by us commentators|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer will probably win in hand to start D|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|lml: I like the small club|pg||
nt|lml: lets see if it gets north|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: perfect play the small @c|pg||
nt|xenya: not likely to make -- but you never know|pg||
nt|bt: thing is only real suit shown by ns is spades so a take out is for all other suits|pg||
nt|jbennet: east had a chance to x 3NT |pg||
pc|s4|nt|kiwibridge: this is cruisy should be well in time|pg||
nt|skaftij:  running scores|pg||
nt|skaftij:  http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Microsite/RunningScores/ASP/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?redirect=1&qtournid=881|pg||
nt|skaftij:  pick a slam?|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: now west turn|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: in the tank|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Some tell me West may have shown (17) 18-19|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Or they guess|pg||
nt|skaftij:  With no obvious fit, East lacks intermediates|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: west stil thinking|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 6@c for iceland on board 12|pg||
nt|bt: anyway thanks hurd!!|pg||
nt|bt: you can come here anytime|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lml: had north wanted south on lead for something he may have ducked|pg||
nt|lml: looks like north will get a spade and a club for +1|pg||
nt|lml: for Baxter|pg||
nt|lml: Israel made an extra uptrick on the previous board to come back to a 9 imp deficit|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: +1 it seems to me|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: but N is thinking a lot|pg||
nt|lml: my guess is he will shift to a heart|pg||
nt|lml: it wont matter|pg||
nt|lml: second choice is another diamond|pg||
nt|lml: who thinks a heart?|pg||
nt|desinka:  yes|pg||
nt|desinka:  +1|pg||
nt|brolucius: Let me take this opportunity to thanks our splendid VG operator, Pim. Excellent session and we very much appreciate your efforts! |pg||
nt|runnerup: only one left so Sweden seems to be in|pg||
nt|gracelin: north didn't see D8 was played ?|pg||
nt|roswolf: YES the match tightens again|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: maybe I didn't...|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|vugraphznv: i do :-)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: would like to see auction after  P-1N[9-12]|pg||
nt|odysseus69: when you have to open 1 heart you hold your breath |pg||
nt|mdgraham: I see West opened 1NT next door, with the 4441 shape   |pg||
nt|jbennet: now that would have alerted west not to panic.|pg||
pc|h6|nt|vugraphznv: Declarer just layed his cards down claiming 11 |pg||
nt|skaftij:  But Easts "quacks" are after al in PD's suits|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|athene: right about now, in fact|pg||
nt|skaftij:  bd 30, Lauria in 3NT in OR|pg||
nt|ady: happy A@S with west    split aces  hopefully now|pg||
nt|panosk: just a diamond ruff in dummy needed here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in venice cup   Netherlands over USA1  now +13|pg||
pc|h3|nt|udo: @S 3-2,, @H finesse,,all is fine|pg||
nt|udo: no @C ruff|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Kibs tell 5NT pick a slam|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: well they picked one that makes lol|pg||
nt|skaftij:  this will pull the match like 16-14 in Iceland favour|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: a looot of explanation going on|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: both sides of the screen|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: stil explanations|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: now North is settled after so much talk and is ready to lead|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: nope..cards on the table..... and thinking|pg||
nt|skaftij:  sry missed that Israel raeched the slam too, I get so many comments, thx|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: his head is burried inside his palms|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Better than 6NT|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: now...asking more questions|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: ....more questions lol|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: back to thinking ....do not go away|pg||
nt|skaftij:  With bidding like this and pauses like,  everyone is aware that the contact may be touch and go. They hate to give the match away on the penultimate deal|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: stil thinking|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this auction would be game force by unpassed hand|pg||
nt|skaftij:  HS can organise a ruff|pg||
nt|skaftij:  NS|pg||
nt|ady: can affford the finnesse|pg||
pc|h7|nt|wild card: now the heart ruff is lost|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @H back would have yielded a ruff as well.|pg||
nt|leao:  he has to extract the @d ace b4 pulling trumps|pg||
nt|oosmanb: bath coup'esque |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: finaly a spade landed on the table|pg||
pc|hK|nt|wild card: and it's only 300|pg||
nt|boedhy:  his @h are too good so no problems indeed|pg||
nt|xenya: so 4 or 5 to Sweden|pg||
nt|ady: lots of tricks now      4 spades   1 diamond   and  3 clubs|pg||
nt|gracelin: now defenders can play 3 round of trump so declarer might need to finesse CQ for a H pitch.  The D8 lost to D10 maybe damaging.|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|brolucius: Many thanks also to my fellow commentators, Lars and Henry. It was an enjoyable session.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the 1@C opening showed 2+, conceivably can have 5 diamonds also if balanced|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice shift|pg||
pc|h5|nt|vugraphznv: this is not good|pg||
nt|lml: that club play is a problem|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer uses the two trump entries to dummy to lead twice towards his club honours.|pg||
nt|gracelin: eclarer needs to finess in club now, or he is down|pg||
nt|gracelin: I am sure the Italian in other room will make this 4S, so if Shi goes down here, the match is almost even|pg||
nt|gracelin: play and defense are areas that the Italian have a big advantage ove other teams.|pg||
nt|roswolf: http://www.worldbridge1.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Results.htm for link to results|pg||
nt|gracelin: they think harder and deeper.|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ahollan1: the other room just started bidding  13|pg||
nt|nkgupt: sud be 2 imps on priv as they r in 2@d|pg||
pc|sT|nt|yuval10: Israel's next match is against Italy, very tough day for them, they've done great so far|pg||
nt|sybarra: but the 4/1 @H break is just pesky |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: so, remove the 2 slam swings and Iceland would have a narrow lead, that's how close it really is|pg||
nt|ady: and 1 heart|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|barnets: Israel have played well in round robin and this is their poorest set shown so far|pg||
nt|brolucius: He is not particularly worried about suffering a club ruff, because he needs to set up the suit anyway, and a ruff may be with a natural trump trick.|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|pc|dA|nt|roswolf: but do they think on the right lines?|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|sK|nt|lml: he still has nine tricks though|pg||
nt|boedhy:  yes drijver will probably get a @h trick at the end|pg||
nt|leao:  hell have to time it carefully|pg||
nt|leao:  but miguel is a careful player :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm so sorry   thought Baldursson rebid 3@D|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ady: 1 imps for Italy|pg||
nt|gracelin: good.  Shi also realized that he must take the club finesse to make.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|panosk: thinking if he can do anything about possible bad breaks but he cant so here you are|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|lml: and that will be a push|pg||
nt|lml: heading to an uptrick |pg||
nt|ady: decided against   quuen could come down in 3|pg||
mc|9|nt|lml: it appears|pg||
nt|oosmanb: not quite bath coup but he won 2 tricks when he deserved 1 in @S|pg||
nt|oosmanb: so should make 7 now|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes indeed|pg||
nt|gracelin: on H return, declarer shud ruff in hand and ruff to establish D|pg||
nt|roswolf: easy from here|pg||
nt|gracelin: and even if he ruffs in dummy, CK will be ruffed out so no problem either. |pg||

nt|vugraphznv: N to the bathroom...|pg||

nt|ahollan1: final board of the match -- for this table|pg||
mb|p|nt|skaftij:  This is the last match today|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: director is here to watch time for the last board, but I don't think they will be punished because of the 10 min for the director call|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: probably both teams will make the last 8 and they deserve it|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: may hope is that Australia will make the last 8 as well :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: see previous explanation of 1@D|pg||
nt|skaftij:  seems South would have been better placed with a 2@h overcall|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Thanks to all the commentators and kibs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=10-15 HCP, 2+@D|pg||
nt|jillan:  any chance 40 imps + can ride on it :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: after this match there will be an appeal over a board of the previous set|pg||
mb|1D|nt|athene: now south has the choice of 2@S, weak takeout|pg||
nt|athene: or 2@C "weak stayman"|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: DBL = 4 or 5 @s|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H for e/w looks the spot|pg||
nt|panosk: next match will start in about an hour|pg||
nt|boedhy:  last board|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: yes all other matches finished|pg||
nt|runnerup: 500 here is good for Nz  but not enougth -ns has to guess well to make any game (3nt)|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Thanks Kevin, excellent operator|pg||
nt|brolucius: Many thanks also to Barnet and Kit, my fellow commentators, for their insights into the play.|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Weinstein asking about the double|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: North asking about the 2c bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but good news is that appeal is moot|pg||
nt|jillan:  which one do you know|pg||
mb|d|nt|skaftij:  Thank you all kibs for good comments, I was not able to bring all forwards |pg||
nt|ady: thx Harold  and specs|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: next match at 13.45 hours|pg||
nt|lml: somebody asked about whether the players know about the running score|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H a make n/s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: common treatment over Michaels showing Majors  is to use 2@H/@S to show stronger hands in @C/@D   and 3minor just competitive|pg||
nt|szalay: or: 3m: INV|pg||
nt|szalay: 2@H/2@S: either weaker OR stronger|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i haven't seen that treatment|pg||
nt|szalay: we call it COMB|pg||
nt|ady: thx Geoffrey  and Karen  and all specs  |pg||
nt|vugraphznv: i still don't know what board it is about|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: 5@h is a decent save against 4@S|pg||
nt|athene: 1@S would be a general takeout without spades|pg||
nt|ehsana: 4S ..1 off seems coming up :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 1@s = 3@ss|pg||
nt|ritong: 1@s is excatly what he has|pg||
nt|skaftij:  thanks to our magnificent operator|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Bob|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Last hand of this match. Thanks to our operator Natalia and specs for watching some absorbing bridge.|pg||
nt|jaapfr: big win on last board expected for Swedes|pg||
nt|antoniz: dziwny splinter|pg||
nt|lechcold: dziwny|pg||
nt|jaapfr: although 5@D can then only 3 imps win|pg||
nt|lechcold: miejmy nadziejê, ¿e nie bêdzie nieporozumienia|pg||
nt|jaapfr: or 3nt|pg||
nt|antoniz: 3NT jest dobre|pg||
nt|lml: they dont but they can usually have a feel for how they are doing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems flawed in that it gives opponents extra space when cue can be weak|pg||
nt|ady: low heart lead    should hold declarer to 4 tricks if defence is awake|pg||
nt|brgpro: we end up with a quiet game here in @s|pg||
mb|2N|nt|athene: maybe if he bids 2@S now over 2red from his partner, that is invitational|pg||
nt|lml: 2NT... the 2 lowest suits|pg||
nt|ritong: garbage with 3@ss|pg||
nt|athene: so double isn't just exactly 4 spades, as in standard methods|pg||
nt|ady: got there quickly    nust know I would like a cup of tea|pg||
nt|ahollan1: vul 1@C includes weak NT as well as some strong hands|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: thx all for watching|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: this is the last board of the day, we restart at 10.30 tomorrow|pg||
nt|oosmanb: This is the fastest session I have ever seen on vugraph|pg||
nt|roswolf: a tricky bd to finish with|pg||
nt|gracelin: Thanjks Geoff and Karen.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: thx Traian|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Thanks, last board for the day here|pg||
nt|skaftij:  3@c must show @d and @s|pg||
nt|wild card: Last board of this match. Next round will start at 13:45 local time (in somewhat more than an hour)|pg||
nt|wild card: is that correct Natalia?|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: yes|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Think so.|pg||
nt|yuval10: answer is of course not|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Thanks everyone, and join us for the next segment|pg||
nt|xenya: 3N is only 400|pg||
nt|szalay: not true|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Thx Geoffrey and Patrick|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: We will be back in about 50 minutes, but I don't know which matches will be on|pg||
nt|roswolf: this has been a fascinating fight|pg||
nt|ady: destines for spade game|pg||
mb|3N|nt|athene: and if he does that north will go to game for sure with a maximum|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder why East bid 4@H instead of 1@D transfer|pg||
nt|jaapfr: sorry in Polish dzien dobry|pg||
nt|ady: all games failing for e/w|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H the best     but fails|pg||
nt|ady: now at  the only making contract |pg||
nt|ady: west considering passing I would think|pg||
nt|sybarra: hate to rebid that ht suit, but really no choice|pg||
nt|leao:  4@h?|pg||
nt|boedhy:  dbl from south standard these days |pg||
nt|boedhy:  I think with all the light opening going on you should have more ...|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Ruud was great company, but it is you the spectators who really make it for us, so thanks @H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: how did that PASS get in there?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: a steal for Israel here|pg||
nt|skaftij:  tough to find the slam|pg||
nt|lechcold: dzienn dobry:)|pg||
nt|lechcold: dzien:)|pg||
nt|lml: in a match like this it isnt always as clear till you compare|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: East almost played @h3|pg||
nt|panosk: vugraph schedule in your own local times http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php|pg||
nt|boedhy:  and there a daring 2nt from west... 3nt from east??|pg||
nt|boedhy:  @s lead........???|pg||
nt|sybarra: I dont play a neg. X quite that lite,     |pg||
nt|leao:  hungry 2NT|pg||
nt|ady: good save 5@D e/w|pg||
nt|ady: may take the push to 5@H|pg||
nt|runnerup: ok looks 9 on top |pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: so who is to blame?|pg||
nt|ady: because I want my cup of tea|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: lol ...for sure|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even assuming weat holds weak NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: weat???   that was supposed to be weSt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  13  Levin in 6@S East|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: wow..|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: that will be worth some imps to usa|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and that after Stefanov opened 3@C|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: south stil thinking ...do not go away|pg||
nt|ahollan1: from other room  "Eighteen minutes left, TD telling the players to be a bit quicker. Levin: "Good one when I'm in 6@S""|pg||
nt|ady: play of 6@S easier after £@C opening|pg||
nt|ady: 3@C|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: we will restart in 50 mins from now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Daily Bulletin always shows the lineup of vugraph matches for the day   http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Veldhoven.11/Bulletins.asp?redirect=1&|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: please rejoin us for more wonderful matches from veldhoven|pg||
nt|lechcold: po tym wicie nie ma problemu z wygraniem 2@S|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Drijver and Brink are a great pair and have had an excellent set here|pg||
nt|ady: Italians maybe showed majors on the same auction in west seat|pg||
nt|gracelin: defending 3D is best.|pg||
mb|p|nt|skaftij:  in OR, still playing no 30|pg||
nt|skaftij:  possible swing to Italy |pg||
nt|wild card: swift surrender by NS|pg||
nt|lechcold: 5@D ³atwo mo¿na po³o¿yæ|pg||
nt|ady: specs suggesting diamond lead  and 4@C is down   but  can still make|pg||
nt|xenya: classic reverse by N on 6-3 |pg||
nt|lml: well he has 7-3|pg||
nt|xenya: tes, 6+|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and a @d among the @hs|pg||
nt|xenya: could be just 6 i meant|pg||
nt|xenya: now S has a great hand for partner|pg||
nt|skaftij:  2B-2NT = trnsf; according to CC|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Levin pointed the finger to the 3s bid and then it gave it a finger down lool|pg||
nt|mdgraham: either the connection is broken or someone is going for a world-record think|pg||
nt|jbennet: he can now bid 3 sp (establishing game force).|pg||
pc|dK|nt|rnmalik: Could make 3NT, 6@D+1@C+2@S=9.|pg||
nt|leao:  it was a very agressive neg x, agree|pg||
nt|boedhy:  think I would lead the @d jack...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Brink only 7 HCP  but pure fit for partner's majors|pg||
nt|brgpro: what...|pg||
nt|ady: surprise choice|pg||
nt|brgpro: i take back what i said...|pg||
nt|jbennet: which was the normal bid. 3NT was a alfa male bid. |pg||
nt|brgpro: 3nT-1 it looks like|pg||
nt|bobholl: for me too :( @C K wrong :(|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lml: how do you allocate it?|pg||
nt|lml: we have "both|pg||
nt|lechcold: @CA - lavinthal pikowy i dalej wiadomo|pg||
nt|lml: Weinstein and Levin did well to get to the best slam|pg||
nt|oosmanb: 6@C is on with A@D right|pg||
nt|oosmanb: and 6NT for same reason|pg||
nt|oosmanb: 6@c additional chance of ruffing @S good|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, it's a good 6@C |pg||
nt|bt: one thing about sloppy play though, its difficult to get back to good bridge|pg||
nt|brolucius: They must play that 2@C promises a major. So, West is able to bid 3@S to show a weak hand and a spade fit.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: double must be a two-suiter by passed hand|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: what you wanted to know Anton?|pg||
nt|anton72: result|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: a link to the running scores?|pg||
nt|anton72: or whats happened |pg||
nt|anton72: no|pg||
nt|anton72: runing scores stay in board 9 from 40 minutes|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: ah i see now too, i dont know what happend...|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lechcold: a i bez tego nie ma jak tego graæ|pg||
nt|jaapfr: yes would be beauty @CA x@S @C for down 1|pg||
nt|lechcold: dziwne decyzje obu naszych graczy|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: nie sympatyzujê ze Splinterem z rêk¹ S....kompletnie nie sympatyzujê|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Jassem chyba pomylil sie w systemie|pg||
nt|antoniz: ja te¿ nie|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Martens zrozumial 3@s jako splinter @h|pg||
nt|lechcold: ale mecz przegramy:(|pg||
nt|kamyk: zamiast podsumowania: jak sie tak patrzy na BBO, to sporo widaæ...|pg||
nt|lechcold: by³o kilka naprawdê bardzo ciekawych rozdañ|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: jutro przekazy z meczu Polaków o 13.30 i 16:45 - tak jak dzisiaj zapraszam z ca³ej si³y...mo¿e wreszcie zobaczymy prawdziwych polskich husarzy|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: o 13.45 :)|pg||
nt|antoniz: do us³uszenia jutro,dobrej nocy:)|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: o 13:45 dziêkujê Nataly...pewnie nei wiecie ¿e opeartorem jest nasza dziewczyna - Natalia Bana od pewnego czasu mieszkaj¹ca w Holandii|pg||
nt|kamyk: powiem za Wañkowiczem: Dziekujê Uprzejmie, Przybêdê Akuratnie:)|pg||
nt|yuval10: makes this and it finished 40:36 and 16:14 for Israel|pg||
nt|odysseus69: looks like 1 down but lets see|pg||
nt|ady: difficult to guage|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @C lead @C ruff doesn't gain anything|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed you can be too macho|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|ritong: the light overcall drives to the wrong lead, seems|pg||
nt|ritong: or not|pg||
nt|skaftij:  I don't know what 4@c meant, maybe finding best denomination|pg||
nt|ady: what but 1 club and 2 spades   assume Zack will ruff high a 2nd diamond?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: ok now|pg||
nt|odysseus69: thot he might play on hearts which fails|pg||
nt|ady: took the save non vul against vul|pg||
nt|ahollan1: natural trump trick|pg||
nt|szalay: Aof@s, @hs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS got one wrong|pg||
nt|nkgupt: so the first set team orrange doing remarkably well ...extending their lead from 2 to 20|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|lml: and Lindop|pg||
nt|sybarra: think I might also |pg||
nt|boedhy:  dont think he would have led that against 3nt...|pg||
nt|leao:  and that was the 8th trick|pg||
nt|pbundy: hard to decipher the wasted values and lack of fit|pg||
pc|h5|nt|lml: and Baxter|pg||
nt|lml: votes each way|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: jeli to tak mia³o byæ, to jednak nie bêdê wkuwa³ systemu M-J:)|pg||
nt|lml: I think North might have tried 6@D here|pg||
nt|panosk: our thanks to our very able operator Pim, great job indeed|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: AFR Points: A=3, K=2 and Q=1|pg||
nt|oosmanb: dont need A@D onside for 6@C like I said, @S can be ruffed good with K@H entry. 4@S 6@C 2@H|pg||
nt|oosmanb: but 6NT does need it so 6@C better|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: S has shown 5-3-3-2 and 5 AFR points with the 3nt bid|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: I havent seen an explanation of the 4@d bid|pg||
nt|xenya: let's see how well their relay system will work here|pg||
nt|skaftij:  This might be a pickup to Iceland|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: saved by e|pg||
nt|skaftij:  N temted|pg||
nt|skaftij:  tempted|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: north in the tank|pg||
nt|skaftij:  in OR, @d King was led|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: probably a double will come after|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: stil thinking|pg||
nt|skaftij:  @s Ace aganst 4 @h here, if bid would make declarer task more difficult|pg||
nt|ady: this could be a swing for Italy   4@S making|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lml: yes the 2NT bid was a killer|pg||
nt|lml: I think west is more to blame myself|pg||
nt|lml: I wonder what they would have played the double of 2NT|pg||
nt|yuval10: so USA1 will preserve 10 imps over the last board, still 16:14 Israel|pg||
nt|lml: he didnt cuebid over 3@H|pg||
nt|ady: in fact can make setting up spades    just 2 sspade losers|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: last board of this match - and tomorrow the Round Robin continues|pg||
nt|skaftij:  nope|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: and passes|pg||
nt|anton72: ok ...TY Vincent |pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: thank you to Panos|pg||
nt|panosk: not as good as 4@S but it ll make|pg||
nt|panosk: thank you Pim|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: good victory the Netherlands|pg||
nt|skaftij:  420 + 140?|pg||
nt|skaftij:  11 imps|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: it will be close to a draw|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: both teams happy i would say|pg||
nt|garden2005: atak atutowy dawa³ jakie nadziej?|pg||
nt|antoniz: kara zlokalizowane|pg||
nt|kamyk: pora na po¿egnania - do lepszych czasów (tylko w naszym bryd¿u, to one ju¿ zdaje siê by³y) |pg||
nt|ryskiel_: dziêkujê kolegom za ten ciê¿ki tydzieñ, mo¿e jeszcze seniorzy dadz¹ nam okazjê |pg||
nt|ryskiel_: dziêkujê wszystkim kibicom, |pg||
nt|jbennet: if p over 3sp had insisted on 3NT, then south could pass.|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|psyck:  Running Scores: http://www.wkbridge2011.nl/en/live/scorebord-bermuda-bowl|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: next round in 1 hour approx|pg||
nt|xenya: i don't think most of us understand this auction|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: A=3point, K=2points Q=1point|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: the 4@s bid showed 2K and 1Q |pg||
nt|garden2005: bez pracy nie ma Karolu ko³aczy... tak jest od wieków |pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: 11-58 is in Vips?|pg||
nt|ady: maybe not after this hand|pg||
nt|brgpro: why Brink chose to X rather than a bit heavy 1@s...|pg||
pc|c2|nt|vugraphznv: 4@C fit for at least 1 with good hand |pg||
nt|skaftij:  Jonsson had the chance to defeat, just missed|pg||
nt|skaftij:  bd 30 OR|pg||
nt|ady: good start from north    thats kept it to down 2|pg||
nt|brgpro: will go down 3 here|pg||
pc|d8|nt|lml: he really has a pretty good playing strength hand|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: still 6 matches left for the teams to qualify for the quarterfinals|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: top 8 will advance|pg||
nt|ady: I thin might have done better playing diamonds   forcing dummys trumps  to try and nulify the spade suit|pg||
nt|ady: difficult to beat this now|pg||
nt|ady: diamond led would have been better for defence|pg||

nt|gracelin: What a set !, China recovered 50 imps against ITALY to take the lead.|pg||
nt|gracelin: tks all and bye|pg||
nt|roswolf: sets up the match nicely|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Bocchi and Madala didn't look worried yet when they saw the score...|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: Closing down now, see you later|pg||
nt|jbennet: D followed by 3 sp=" I have good hand with spades which is too strong for an overcall"|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ritong: same goes for comments.please calm down.|pg||
nt|runnerup: yes i can see 11 in notrumps -true but 500 will win some imps -|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: 25-4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: trump leads beat 4@H|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: 3@h was a real pressure bid over the nebulous 1@d|pg||
nt|ady: 11 tricks in spades|pg||
pc|c6|nt|lml: if you play 3@S is not forcing maybe you could but that is hard|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: na Ciebie Karopl zawsze mogê liczyæ:) |pg||
nt|ady: so another imp for Italy|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|harmon: .|pg||

nt|ady: Sememta hoping for another slip up to come to 6 tricks|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|harmon: Baxter has clear 3h bid competition in spades|pg||
nt|harmon: 3s is forcing|pg||
nt|boedhy:  but there you see even another disadvantage for the double...|pg||
nt|garden2005: dziêkujê równie¿ za wspólne kibicowanie :) do zobaczenia|pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: Dobrze, ¿e nie zrobili nadróbki...|pg||

nt|xenya: Match A Open Room will be kept open to announce the quarterfinal pairings|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Brink-Drijver have been very solid  and when speeding, haven't been caught|pg||
nt|brolucius: Indonesia South (Venice Cup) bid 4@S on the South cards.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: versace plays the @DQ to make it look as though he has nothing in diamonds in hand|pg||
nt|lml: so a pickup for the usa|pg||
nt|ady: but I dont thinks so|pg||
nt|ahollan1: indeed it was   full credit to Nystrom|pg||
pc|hK|nt|athene: still, Bocchi-Madala should wander into this game without much trouble|pg||
nt|lechcold: mecz skoñczy siê 16:14 dla nas|pg||
nt|lechcold: wynik chyba lepszy niz gra|pg||
nt|lechcold: i jak na historiê naszych potyczek ze Szwedami  -ca³kiem niez³y|pg||

nt|sybarra: do we have link to scores/standings?|pg||
nt|xenya: well done indeed|pg||
nt|oosmanb: Grazie a tutti|pg||
nt|skaftij:  A lot of missed opportunities by Iceland. But the match is far from over yet, still 80 boards to go|pg||
nt|roswolf: nor do i|pg||
nt|ady: has shown too much  |pg||
nt|ady: so 37 imps for Italy half way|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h9|pg||

nt|roswolf: still a close match|pg||
nt|vugraphznv: thank you all, goodbye|pg||
nt|roswolf: bye for now|pg||
nt|nkgupt: for me a ssimple 1@s|pg||
nt|ady: I expect 12 back to Italy|pg||

nt|bobholl: i am sure :(|pg||
nt|brgpro: yes, 12|pg||
nt|ady: thx all|pg||
nt|brgpro: thanks en bedankt|pg||
nt|jbennet: that however 3sp would start a coopeation. Whereas a unilateral decision will express his dominance in the flock.|pg||
nt|jbennet: so the 3NT did indeed confirmed his alfa male status.|pg||
nt|jbennet: to the prize of -10-11 IMP:s|pg||
