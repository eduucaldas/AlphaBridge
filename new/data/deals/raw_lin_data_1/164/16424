mb|1S|mb|3C|nt|diablo666: Actually 10 in clubs normally just mean that you don´t like the suit, rare with Lavinthal in these positions in Sweden.|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|greerm: good evening, this is the first CAmrose cap for Willie Hamilton, brother of Ian, we wish him well|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: NS can make 3N pretty easily|pg||
pc|cK|nt|paulg:  pretty similar systems for both pairs, 5-card majors, strong 1NT and three weak 2s|pg||
nt|greerm: Willie has also represented Northern Ireland at fencing in I think the Commonwealth Games|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|nt|bridge_one: the lead J@S is a surprise holding QJ10987 in @H|pg||
nt|justin c: a @h and a @S to lose here|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|po-s: EW can sacrifice in 4D or S|pg||
nt|chick: If they think the 3N is making, yes :)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|odysseus69: dummy was a disappointment - |pg||
pc|c8|pc|cQ|nt|bridge_one: but South think to find a suit better that @H, because his K in @C is very bad after 3@C by W|pg||
nt|garnetts: at least there is no money involved |pg||
nt|odysseus69: with a banced 15 it is normal to bid 3NT over 3D - but sometimes it can lead to a big penalty though not here|pg||
nt|odysseus69: difficult to find a discard from dummy|pg||
nt|odysseus69: diamond looks best|pg||
nt|garnetts: would you have expressed an opinion about 3NT Victor ?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: i am too much of a coward - but you would be there David - what do you think about club king as alternative lead|pg||
nt|garnetts: I think it best for the usual reasons |pg||

pc|h2|pc|hA|pc|h7|pc|h6|pg||
pc|s7|nt|bridge_one: the question is: the opps probably have 9 tricks - the lead @H try to beat the contract finding any good layout - the lead @S need to find more cards |pg||

nt|justin c: hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: they are so aggressive that is possible to see 3@H now|pg||
nt|paulg:  normal high level bridge, three passes to you and then no-one passes before your next call|pg||
nt|chick: first they have to get into the bidding|pg||
nt|peachy: Second seat Vul maybe kept Salisbury from opening|pg||
nt|peachy: not unreasonable at all, when the suits are minors|pg||
nt|po-s: if he bids 3C I will leave|pg||
nt|peachy: heh PO|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|odysseus69: I dont know much about the Welsh pair. They will do well to restrainIrelands leading pair|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|bridge_one: in money game DBL now for sure |pg||
nt|justin c: quality that counts Mark|pg||
nt|po-s: thanks, I maintain it is a difficult hand to find slam on|pg||
pc|s4|nt|bridge_one: in IMP competition need to be more safe|pg||
nt|justin c: speaking of quality, this 3NT contract lacks it|pg||
nt|justin c: horrible contract, but neither N nor S can remotely put a red card on it|pg||
nt|garnetts: Nothing exceptional here|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not clear cut is it?  |pg||
pc|s8|nt|paulg:  3@c is a brave call as Sime was not guaranteed a fit (Matheson might hold five hearts for example)|pg||
nt|greerm: helpful lead|pg||
nt|paulg:  blame the 2@s bidder|pg||
nt|justin c: so i guess this will just drift several off|pg||
nt|odysseus69: very respectful of partners balancing action|pg||
nt|garnetts: Probably done well to pass as 3NT needs the diamond finesse and thats certainly not clearcut |pg||
nt|garnetts: this contrcat needs the same view I suppose too|pg||
nt|garnetts: I am afraid that I would have overcalled with 2@S earlier |pg||
nt|po-s: even without an opening by West|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|greerm: when the other 3 suits look dangerous too|pg||

pc|c4|nt|garnetts: have to say a club looks so obvious I wouldn't even think about it |pg||

nt|diana1: hi all and welcome to the first match in this year's Camrose series - the home internationals|pg||
nt|sheila a: South's hand is pretty poor but NV she figured it was worth a pre-empt|pg||
nt|greerm: not a brilliant contract but...|pg||
nt|paulg:  impossible for anyone except Deep Finesse or GIB to find the @cK lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: there is no lead that will do any good here--and a spade costs |pg||
mb|6N|nt|Walddk3: Welcome to Lars Andersson|pg||
nt|bridge_one: N/S are playing strong @C or not ?|pg||

nt|justin c: no game for EW with the @SK wrong|pg||
mb|p|nt|po-s: just forcing probably|pg||

nt|paulg:  we have seen a lot of two-suiters tonight, perhaps the theme of the weekend|pg||

nt|vugraphzxz: ok we are back! lost the play on 19, sry|pg||
nt|garnetts: well played :)|pg||
nt|justin c: 3NT for EW here|pg||
mb|p|nt|diana1: the pre-empt worked well|pg||
nt|paulg:  the play on 19 would have been uninteresting, we can live without it :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzxz: figured as much :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: North has a clear 3@S opening in my view these 6-4 hands usually play well and the spades are pretty good |pg||
nt|odysseus69: will South double 3 hearts?-|pg||
mb|1C|nt|diablo666: Skara playing their first year in "Elitserien" doing a fantastic job, a true outsider looking to win.|pg||
nt|paulg:  1NT is 14-16|pg||
mb|1D|nt|diana1: the Northern Irish pair play a pretty basic system with weak NT and 4-card majors|pg||
nt|odysseus69: if he does willNort pass|pg||
nt|peachy: NS play Acol and 4-card majors|pg||
mb|1H|nt|garnetts: yes and about as difficult to make as the last one |pg||
mb|1S|nt|paulg:  Charles and Vi Outred play a system developed by Charles, something akin to Polish Club|pg||
nt|sheila a: NS are likely to bid too high with that tasty @c suit|pg||
nt|garnetts: If NS get to some number of no-trumps there is a classic intra finesse position in clubs |pg||
mb|2C|nt|bt: it is like fc copenhagen winning the champions league|pg||
nt|Walddk3: :)|pg||
nt|bt: oddswise|pg||
nt|diana1: why do I never seem to get suits like that?:)|pg||
nt|paulg:  as it happens a direct 5@c would work as West would lead a spade, but now wrongsided|pg||
nt|greerm: promise 3H maybe|pg||
nt|paulg:  tough for Willie now, doubling with a void always a concern|pg||
nt|justin c: y indeed|pg||
nt|garnetts: 2@S or 3@S Victor?  |pg||
mb|p|nt|sheila a: 2@d showed both majors, 2NT obviously some kidn of transfer|pg||
nt|sheila a: Question is what 3@c showed|pg||
nt|paulg:  East has made a vulnerable overcall of a strongish 1NT, so I think pass rather than double is prudent over 3@c|pg||
nt|diana1: I think most people these days treat 14-16 NT as a strong NT|pg||
nt|greerm: difficult for east too|pg||
nt|paulg:  impossible for East|pg||
nt|vugraphzxz: double explained as promising 3 @Hs|pg||
nt|garnetts: Lets see if they can do it in defence |pg||
nt|justin c: close to 3NT for NS|pg||
nt|garnetts: this will tell us |pg||
nt|odysseus69: the ultra conservative approach continues|pg||
nt|garnetts: I bet he would bid 4@H over 3@S |pg||
mb|2D!|mb|d|nt|greerm: seems a simpel 1 off, anyone see anything lese?|pg||
nt|justin c: too early for difficult contracts|pg||
mb|2H|nt|Walddk3: Give us Man Utd|pg||
nt|bt: what are the chances of that roland?|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Non-existent|pg||
nt|bt: seems board 23-24 are slightly favorable for skara|pg||
nt|bt: well skara is winning here so|pg||
nt|odysseus69: i like 3S bur expected 2|pg||
mb|2S|nt|chessmaste: Looks like the same ten tricks too|pg||
mb|3H|nt|diana1: very hard for Vi to imagine that Charles has also 3 losing @hs|pg||
nt|sheila a: I suppose she might have made a try for 3NT, not that it helps on this hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bridge_one: North can make 1Nt if opps play 4 round in @H also with return @D guessing @C figure|pg||
nt|garnetts: my current pet idea 6-4 with a reasonable six carder open three|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d5|nt|xenya: but this might make|pg||
pc|dA|nt|odysseus69: he knows where the king of clubs is so ak of hearts then ace of clubs|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sQ|nt|bt: the natural play works|pg||
pc|sK|nt|diana1: so early on in the match she is probably going for what she thinks is the safest thing|pg||
nt|paulg:  all the reasons are there to make North declarer on this hand, but it just did not work here|pg||
nt|garnetts: I think that west should bid 1@D rather than pass--playing a system where 1@C can be short alolows you to respond on garbage when you have short clubs  |pg||
nt|odysseus69: oops- bad play|pg||

pc|h5|nt|bt: no probs yet for skara but ...|pg||
pc|d8|nt|justin c: with @S1098 can afford to try the @C finesse, still safe |pg||
nt|justin c: going a few off in a 3-2 fit at 100 a trick is an expensive business|pg||
nt|odysseus69: club ruff was a stand out - bad play all  round|pg||
nt|garnetts: Now three clubs and exit with a @D or a spade |pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s3|nt|Walddk3: Maybe you could tell the audience where in the world Skara is located (other than in Sweden)|pg||

nt|bt: i dont know?|pg||
nt|bt: where is it?|pg||
nt|bt: :-)|pg||
nt|diablo666: Skara is about 150 km northeast of Göteborg.|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sT|pg||
nt|bridge_one: for north need to find A in @C in East - then now @D is correct|pg||

pc|c5|nt|diablo666: Nopr, wrong side of Lake Vänern :) .|pg||

nt|greerm: but when dbl promises 3H, then he had a different decision|pg||
nt|justin c: did N think dec had another trump there?|pg||
nt|justin c: lets move on|pg||
nt|garnetts: looks like a routine 3NT making lots |pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Dan Neill|pg||
nt|garnetts: The last hand dec had no choice but to get the spade right because he could count North's points--the ace of spades he would open |pg||
nt|djneill:  hi all|pg||
nt|justin c: hi Dan|pg||
nt|garnetts: Hello Dan |pg||
nt|garnetts: hmmmmmmmm|pg||
nt|odysseus69: north was marked with KQJ of spades - the QJ of diamonds so could not have king of clubs. |pg||
nt|garnetts: true but then South could not have been suitably manipulated as he was |pg||
nt|odysseus69: wise not to double!!|pg||
mb|1H|mb|2D|nt|justin c: agreed he should get the @S right|pg||
mb|d|nt|sheila a: This is the slight downside to the Multi, in that it's easier for E to come in over 2@d than 2@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|greerm: 3NT?|pg||
nt|justin c: but the chances of doing so were dramatically improved by N endplaying S|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|garnetts: this theme came up in the first set--do you guys think 1@S is best or 2@C?|pg||
nt|garnetts: Canape opening |pg||
nt|garnetts: interesting |pg||
mb|p|nt|diana1: very true|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: likely to finish in a partcsore --1NT or 2@S |pg||
nt|justin c: 2@C for me|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|greerm: not the greatest dummy but has chances|pg||
nt|greerm: in theory 4@C 2@S 2@D and 1@H |pg||
nt|greerm: can the defence chalenge that?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3NT should end it now|pg||
pc|sK|nt|justin c: 3NT or 4@S here i think|pg||
nt|chessmaste: 4@S is possible|pg||
pc|s6|nt|paulg:  i don't think they can, but a few concerns for declarer|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|paulg:  the upside is that West may not have a cue bid available|pg||
nt|garnetts: Norman did well to avoid 2@C |pg||
pc|c2|nt|greerm: he that hesitates is lost ?|pg||
nt|garnetts: strange auction on Board three in the OR  and they failed to double the final contract and still gained 5 imps |pg||
nt|odysseus69: The Irish South must have heard your tip David - he opened 3D with 6-4 on board 2 and picked up 5 imps|pg||
pc|c9|nt|bt: we had an undo. makes more sense now. maybe there should be a bid for the west hand|pg||
nt|djneill:  I like 2@c as well|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|garnetts: well I agree I much prefer 2@C |pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|justin c: for one thing, 2@C to be followed with 2@S is more economical than 1@S then 3@C, as here|pg||
nt|garnetts: he did--but I wouldn't bid it with a side major unless partner had passed laready |pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|nt|justin c: intra the @S suit :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: Yes I forgot we all overbid here nbecause we are such great card players these days |pg||
nt|chessmaste: Will not be easy - at the very least needs an intra finesse in spades  |pg||
pc|sT|nt|sheila a: I think if partner bids one major have to use the other as a cue|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Always easy to overbid from the commentators seat|pg||
nt|garnetts: If plays the intra he likely looked --he will surely try and ruff a club and try ace and another spade|pg||
nt|chessmaste: I suspect he will struggle whatever he does|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c8|nt|garnetts: He surely did not play the Q@H  |pg||
nt|vugraphzxz: yes :)|pg||
nt|chessmaste: A cunning fasle card Mr B. |pg||
nt|justin c: helping declarer to finesse the @H10 later|pg||
nt|garnetts: it was a bit windy not to double 4@C |pg||
pc|c3|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|garnetts: maybe that is a better idea than helping partner--|pg||
pc|c4|nt|xenya: 2@C by W would have been the winner, but perhaps that is not allowed by their system|pg||
pc|d2|nt|garnetts: He must be so glad he played that Q@H now |pg||
pc|c5|nt|bt: people usually dont work much on 1X-(1N)-?? in their system, pretty common auction|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|greerm: looks like defence can make it difficult but not quite difficult enough|pg||
nt|greerm: @C now only postpones it|pg||
nt|paulg:  a club now would force declarer to guess the layout|pg||
pc|d9|nt|bridge_one: N/S have @D, greter that @C|pg||
nt|garnetts: and does show the five four shape you actually have--C plus S  not the other way round |pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|nt|odysseus69: veer windy- partner opened 3D vulnerable in 2nd seat and it looked like 4 tricks in his own hand|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|garnetts: he has to play a club --no option |pg||
nt|chessmaste: No reason to play the king here - unless you are on declarer's side|pg||

nt|justin c: looking for 5-3 @H fit|pg||

nt|diana1: pity Burns didnt bid 2@c to show sme sort of a weak hand with majors as then Lindsay may have found a 3@s bid which does very nicely|pg||

nt|garnetts: that will not take any prisoners either |pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
pc|s2|nt|justin c: 5 imps to England for playing 3@D instead of 3NT brd 2|pg||
pc|s4|nt|garnetts:  I think 3NT after 3@D likely shows 4-4 majors and that leaves 3@H as a relay|pg||
nt|justin c: 3@h, i am told, denies 4@H but does not promise 4@S|pg||

pc|s3|nt|sheila a: Yes, that would have worked better|pg||

nt|garnetts: an old fashioned 3@C raise--it used to be a transfer to 3NT (:)) but in good style strongly suggests playing in the suit|pg||
pc|s8|nt|djneill:  South was listening clearly|pg||
nt|odysseus69: do we know what 3C meant?|pg||
nt|garnetts: K@S is surely obvious--since you doscouraged with the six --then you know partner has only two :) |pg||

nt|odysseus69: most of world are opening balanced 11s (not me or Maddocks)|pg||

mb|1H|nt|bt: i thought this was the 1@S = i have 13 cards|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1@S suction - so one suit hand in @C or two suit @D+@H|pg||

mb|p|nt|garnetts: back to my usual comments about opening bad 11 counts |pg||
nt|odysseus69: maybe they play Drury- if so North would be troubled- but ok|pg||
nt|garnetts: not much I do understand about the bidding these days --but if 3@D is a splinter they have done well |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|garnetts: I am getting too old --I have never liked drury much either |pg||
pc|cJ|nt|paulg:  could be blamed now :)|pg||

pc|cK|nt|garnetts: what is 3NT supposed to mean?   3@S I get but 3NT?  |pg||
nt|odysseus69: 5 clubs now enough|pg||
nt|odysseus69: maybe thinking about 4 clubs but not a good idea|pg||
nt|odysseus69: partner marked with 4-4-1-4 now|pg||
nt|garnetts: what is 3NT then?  Am I being stupid?  |pg||
nt|odysseus69: i thinh- only 4 hearts|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c2|pg||
nt|greerm: 6-5 come alive |pg||
nt|garnetts: No need to play a 4-3 fit--why risk it |pg||
pc|hK|nt|paulg:  2NT is a minor pre-empt, so they may play some form of kokish|pg||
nt|djneill:  David are you saying that East can use the information from the opening now to find the big honors?|pg||
nt|justin c: 9 imps to wales for making 3NT on brd 20|pg||
nt|justin c: intra finesse in @C, as predicted|pg||
nt|justin c: (east doubled the opening bid, making that the indicated line)|pg||
nt|garnetts: partly yes--also it makes life hard for partner knowing when to compete--and also leads to too many abd contracts |pg||
nt|garnetts: no objection in third seat though |pg||
nt|justin c: certainly reassuring on this board to know the @HA is in S, so you have an entry for @S tricks|pg||
nt|garnetts: there was an earlier hand where North had a nine count after partner opened but did not compete on board 19 |pg||
nt|peachy: this lead COULD have been brilliant on another layout|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|bridge_one: 4@S with A A and Q of trump is conservative|pg||
nt|bt: y i agree, was a sweet hand|pg||
nt|diana1: yes I think they do|pg||
nt|sheila a: If Vi knows this is from 3 she can duck|pg||
nt|garnetts: I see what you mean--3@S shows maybe five hearts and 3NT  4-4-4-1   nice |pg||
pc|h2|nt|odysseus69: trump lead would solve all|pg||
nt|garnetts: the lead isn't exactly damaging is it |pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|paulg:  still only four tricks for the defence ... really need to lead both blacks suits to trick one|pg||
nt|djneill:  I think South can consider many things here, it is hard to know which is best|pg||
pc|c7|nt|bt: i assume west didnt splinter because of @CA singelton, and east then assumed no shortness, thats the only explanation for 4@S on such a prime hand|pg||
nt|paulg:  and, naturally, continue both blacks suits when in with the diamond|pg||
nt|garnetts: well a @D was |pg||
nt|garnetts: it would have inconvienced east --make him need to get hearts right I think |pg||
pc|c4|nt|garnetts: EW using reverse attitude|pg||
pc|h4|pc|c3|pg||
pc|hA|nt|paulg:  it's clearly a very good hand when partner shows four in one of your suits|pg||
pc|h5|nt|justin c: this is where the auction helps him|pg||
pc|d2|pc|c5|pg||
nt|chick: being brilliant by underleading an A against a suit contract should be reserved for the newpapers|pg||
pc|d8|nt|bridge_one: Ax in @D is very strong figure over 2@d by West|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d3|pc|dJ|pg||

nt|paulg:  1@c is 11-13 balanced or any strong hand .. Lindsay will think he knows which|pg||
nt|paulg:  generally best to pass with very strong hands|pg||

nt|justin c: NS could get into trouble here|pg||
nt|garnetts: you should work out why a @D back is best--North clearly must have two or three clubs only so play partner for the right @D holding |pg||

nt|diana1: it says on their convention card that 2@c over a strong 1@c opening is natural|pg||

mb|p|nt|toobad: must be playing 5 card stayman|pg||
nt|vugraphzxz: IH suddenly realises he has pulled 1NT by accident|pg||
nt|paulg:  West about to bid an invitational 4NT?|pg||
nt|garnetts: 3NT or 4@H ?  |pg||

mb|4D!|nt|justin c: so i guess 1@C-3@C is something truly awful|pg||
nt|garnetts: why the second double--3@C better isn't it?  |pg||
nt|odysseus69: double looks a bad idea - why not 3C|pg||
mb|p|nt|greerm: spec tells me 1NT was 15-17|pg||
nt|garnetts: I like to get in and out quickly with this hand type--3@C makes them find fit at that level 21D might let them in more easily |pg||
mb|4S|nt|paulg:  2@c was 5-card stayman|pg||
nt|garnetts: I agree with Mark 3NT looks like a good shot now |pg||

mb|p|nt|toobad: stretcher please??|pg||

mb|p|nt|sheila a: The Outreds routinely open light so Vi has to invite with her 12 count|pg||
nt|chessmaste: All over for the defence now|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: it looks as if McGann has overbid his cards and Hanlon may raise|pg||
pc|s5|nt|bridge_one: playing 3Nt instead 4Nt is a advantage|pg||
nt|greerm: out alive :)|pg||
nt|paulg:  nice auction from West ... this must show some slam interest with no diamond control|pg||
nt|justin c: grab this, pitch a @S on the @CA, and pull trumps|pg||
nt|odysseus69: he knows his partner|pg||
nt|garnetts: To me this looks like a very strong sequence by East--the second double and then 4@C  |pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|nt|bt: can discard a sapde and a club, what next|pg||
nt|diana1: they are obviously playing transfer responses to 1@c here and the 1@s bid denies 3@hs |pg||
nt|paulg:  not so obvious I'm afraid|pg||
nt|diana1: 3@ss rather|pg||
nt|justin c: there are preemptive raises, and preemptive raises|pg||
nt|justin c: not a bad idea to give p a clue what is happening|pg||
nt|justin c: for instance, he has 18-19 bal, and needs to know whether to bid 3NT now|pg||
nt|justin c: kibs asking - 1@C showed 3+ @C|pg||
nt|garnetts: true--if he has then bid it in my view--having all this extra system burdens the mind for the play and serves leiitel useful purpose |pg||

nt|justin c: @H10 i think|pg||
nt|justin c: planning on forcing the S hand|pg||
nt|djneill:  @h would kill a red squeeze against East in some situations (@hA is communication)|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|paulg:  1@h shows any 12+ and 1@s shows 11-13 balanced|pg||
nt|diana1: I know that David and Rex in the other room do |pg||
nt|paulg:  then 2@h is a transfer to spades followed by invitational 2NT|pg||
nt|diana1: ok|pg||
nt|sheila a: some work needed here|pg||
nt|paulg:  this would not be a good hand for lead of 10 showing 0 or 2 higher honours|pg||

mb|p|nt|garnetts: needs care on a spade lead |pg||
mb|2N!|nt|paulg:  3@c is 9-12 HCP with 3 spades|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 1C is Polish - either weak balanced or strong club|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: I know--but it would have been a good time to try 1@H wouldn't it?  |pg||
nt|odysseus69: I suppose that East was limited on last since he didnt open 1 club|pg||

mb|3D!|nt|garnetts: It did not occur to me that North might double |pg||
mb|p|nt|sheila a: E must have known he was giving up the chance of ever getting his A@h so he was relying on partner to have a lot of tricks|pg||

pc|s4|pc|sA|nt|diana1: the play here shouldnt be too difficult although no entries to dummy|pg||
nt|garnetts: Kx looks like a dead holding --so why bother---West might have re booted this and then the double really costs |pg||
nt|justin c: very speculative double|pg||
nt|chessmaste: He is lucky his @D K is a trick - or is he? If East held the ace 6@D would be making.|pg||
nt|garnetts: you get away with this to an extent when the opps forget to use the blue card |pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|c3|nt|greerm: Ian needs to play @H for 1 loser, with no clues?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|djneill:  South was hoping North could bid NT, maybe with Qxx, better sided|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cK|pg||

pc|c6|pc|h3|pc|c8|pc|c4|pg||

pc|d2|pc|d3|nt|diana1: so he can afford to throw a @s and a @h|pg||

nt|djneill:  other table East bid 2@s vulnerable, whew|pg||
nt|garnetts: brave bid--and got rewarded |pg||
nt|justin c: 4@S only here|pg||
nt|garnetts: THis type of hand could be dealt with by opening 2@C and rebidding 4@S maybe |pg||
nt|garnetts: nasty  hand for NS |pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: Hi Roger - do u know where find the CC of players ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzxd: N-S is playing 1@C 16+, 1@D natural, 5c M, 2@D multi, 2M = 10-13 6+|pg||
nt|greerm: 3NT by NS now|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Another easy game here|pg||
nt|garnetts: I would be pretty annoyed giving away 150 for no reason |pg||
mb|1N|nt|diablo666: Nope, sry. Staffan will check it out...|pg||
nt|paulg:  2@c shows diamonds, or a 5-card major with 4-card minor|pg||
nt|paulg:  they have been very solid since the accident on  22, probably give them confidence for the rest of the weekend|pg||
nt|chick: I'm not sure that S should have "super" accepted ... that @DK wasn't carrying it's weight and that left S with a measly 12|pg||
nt|peachy: 14-16|pg||
mb|p|nt|sheila a: not the world's best 4 card minor|pg||
nt|diana1: :)|pg||
nt|paulg:  there could be blood if East doubles|pg||
nt|sheila a: Lindsay may be wondering if partner has @s|pg||
nt|garnetts: If I had been west it would have been 400 |pg||
nt|odysseus69: dont expect too much action by N/S|pg||
mb|p|nt|greerm: or 4@H maybe|pg||
nt|garnetts: unless some oficious busybody tells me its not allowed these days |pg||
mb|p|pc|c4|nt|bridge_one: ty staffan|pg||
nt|justin c: Erichsen agrees with you, anyway|pg||
nt|justin c: we will find out if Selway does presently|pg||
nt|garnetts: so it appears --I am humbled :)  |pg||
nt|djneill:  Selway related to Soloway?|pg||
nt|justin c: easy to reflect with that N hand that you have a trick or two for a partner who can make 4@S without your help|pg||
nt|chick: I count a lot of losers here|pg||
nt|peachy: this cant make|pg||
pc|c3|nt|paulg:  wow, that is a big pass by East|pg||
nt|sheila a: I guess most would play x as pass or correct by E in this situation?|pg||
nt|diana1: it really is - has to do something|pg||
nt|chick: 4 clubs, 2 hearts, maybe a diamond, and maybe a spade|pg||
pc|cA|nt|greerm: 2NT?|pg||
nt|justin c: takeout double here, will lead to 4@H by W|pg||
nt|garnetts: good barrage by NS |pg||
nt|garnetts: well does east absolutely promise four hearts?  I think not |pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|djneill:  West is feeling not bad about setting chances, for a little bit|pg||
pc|c7|nt|greerm: that might deny 2@H in which case N will pass|pg||
nt|paulg:  sometimes in these auctions someone just has to bid notrump even with Jxx|pg||
pc|c9|nt|odysseus69: looks like he needs hearts 2-2|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|bridge_one: many pair use the open of 4@C, in first and second position, with long suit in ! closed and A or K out - here the advantage to play natural|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|greerm: i meant bid 3NT|pg||
nt|garnetts: same hand a heart less and spade more--what would you do?  |pg||
pc|cK|nt|paulg:  this is unlikely to take long|pg||
nt|justin c: @h can still be right in 4-3 fit|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Good point - double cannot guarantee four hearts|pg||
nt|justin c: with short @H hand taking the @S force|pg||
nt|justin c: agreed, X covers a lot of ground|pg||
nt|justin c: not a lot else East can do with quite a lot of hands here|pg||
pc|cT|nt|bridge_one: long suit in @H|pg||
pc|h5|nt|justin c: personally, I am not wild about opening 2@C on hands like this|pg||
nt|djneill:  and there it went|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
pc|c5|nt|chick: he can set up some hearts, but meanwhile the spades are going to be established for the defense, too|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s3|nt|bridge_one: note the force of intermediate cards in the trump suit|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|diana1: double is probably the best thing as he is happy enough if his partner passes or bids spades|pg||
nt|garnetts: This might not make either --needs accurate play |pg||
pc|c2|nt|justin c: i think you need defensive strength too|pg||
pc|s7|nt|paulg:  given the carnage that may ensue, this is probably the safest spot for EW|pg||
nt|garnetts: unlucky if you venture into the five level |pg||
pc|s2|nt|djneill:  best defense is a good offense, so South has a lot of defense|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|chessmaste: The 4-1 heart break is a blow for declarer|pg||
nt|chessmaste: He must now change tack |pg||
pc|h2|nt|sheila a: maybe he was worried that he had insufficient defence if partner was quite weak??|pg||
nt|justin c: outvoted as usual :)|pg||
nt|justin c: problem one, north has no idea when he should bid on over 4@S here|pg||
pc|h9|nt|garnetts: The late John Collins first used this idea--and i thought he was right when I first saw it and still do |pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|pg||
nt|garnetts: that will mean he gets the @D length right though--so a @D to the K --simply play the k@D first then lead towards  the ace |pg||
pc|hT|nt|paulg:  except opponents are already limited, so can easily be your hand|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Is on track now|pg||
nt|garnetts: Liggins can ruff or not as won't matter now --Mortons Fork |pg||
nt|garnetts: drink the water and die or don't drink the water and die |pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pc|sT|pg||

nt|chick: that won't make N very happy, he already had visions of slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  some pairs will be in 3NT on these cards|pg||
mb|2C|nt|djneill:  West could have had this hand the previous board, given South's 2@c opening theorty|pg||
nt|justin c: slam excellent if N had @HK and a minor suit A|pg||
mb|d|nt|garnetts: I was thinking weak two |pg||
nt|justin c: rather than his actual @DK @CA|pg||
mb|p|nt|justin c: ok - this one is a 2@C opener :)|pg||
nt|djneill:  no no, open 1@d, in case opps bid 4@s :-)|pg||
nt|peachy: Tedd had a way to show both majors, apparently we went with the Dbl (Assume penalty) instead|pg||
mb|2S|nt|paulg:  fewer will be in 2@s|pg||
nt|garnetts: west has a clear cut 4@S now I think|pg||
nt|justin c: y|pg||
nt|peachy: *he |pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: 2Nt i suppose raise with 4 cards, but can be weaker that Jacoby 2Nt|pg||
mb|4S|nt|justin c: wonder what would have happened if S passed 2@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|sheila a: This should be more straightforward|pg||
nt|paulg:  a quieter hand as everything behaves|pg||
nt|diana1: looks like an easy enough 4@hs especially as the @ds are breaking|pg||
nt|justin c: you have defensive stuff here, the oppo are vul|pg||
nt|chick: I thought X didn't describe his hand well at all|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|justin c: nothing v appealing for W to do|pg||
pc|cK|nt|garnetts: Just out of curiosity waht would an initial 3@S show?  |pg||
nt|djneill:  true|pg||
nt|peachy: well, he has it set in his own hand but only 1 trick|pg||
nt|peachy: by one trick|pg||
nt|chick: exactly, and vul with a hand like that, I'd want to be declaring|pg||
nt|peachy: I have to admit I would have started describing my hand|pg||
pc|sT|nt|justin c: presumably a stronger hand than this|pg||
nt|garnetts: well actually the sequence 2@C 2@D 3@d is always difficult |pg||
nt|justin c: it is|pg||
nt|justin c: for many, this denies a M|pg||
nt|djneill:  East was not expecting to play this one|pg||
pc|c6|nt|diablo666: West showing extra values with no short suit, a bid that shows a positive attitude towards life :) .|pg||
nt|bridge_one: only 1 key cards in East, perhaps better 4@S over 3@D (but i don't know what means 3@D, could be conventional bid)|pg||
nt|chessmaste: I am not sure a simple 2@S is right on the East hand - maybe 3@S - unless they think that is weak|pg||
nt|garnetts: or weaker?  |pg||
nt|justin c: (using 2@C-2@D-3M as 4M and longer @D)|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|hA|nt|greerm: standard lead with 5 trumps |pg||
nt|chick: this should make, draw trump, ruff the 3rd heart, then pitch diamonds on hearts, ruff the 3rd diamond|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|nt|garnetts: I agree with Mark here--I like 3@S to be this hand type--no point in pre-empting with 3@S |pg||
nt|justin c: i dont know the EW bidding methods here|pg||
nt|justin c: but i think that 3@S would be a strong 1 suiter|pg||
nt|justin c: question is whether this is 'strong'|pg||
nt|justin c: it is if your p promises to produce the @SK and an A|pg||
nt|chessmaste: The other question you need to ask is if I bid 2@S will partner pass on many hands where we have a play for game?|pg||
nt|justin c: y, was wondering what, if anything, West would do if S had passed|pg||
nt|justin c: of the first 7 boards, 6 were flat|pg||
nt|justin c: slam decent here for EW|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@D 14/15 no shortness (this inf., by kibitz, so TY :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: Yup--that is why I do not like 2@S |pg||
pc|hK|pc|h6|pc|h4|nt|chessmaste: Whenever West has modest spades he will be likley to pass, even with decent high card strength.|pg||
nt|garnetts: There was a case for a penalty double of 3@H --but usually you cannot do that as west |pg||
nt|chick: only works because trumps split|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hQ|pc|s7|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|chessmaste: That is why I would be inclined to overcall 3@S - then partner does not have to worry so much about trump support|pg||
nt|garnetts: I mean it means somehting else like a game try in spades |pg||
pc|s2|nt|garnetts: that was needed --good switch |pg||

nt|paulg:  weak 5-6s are always worrisome though|pg||
nt|garnetts: Liggins will regret bidding 3@H now I suppose |pg||
nt|djneill:  lucky red breaks|pg||
nt|garnetts: This is an interesting hand --two first round controls in North hand |pg||
nt|djneill:  what a close set it has been|pg||
nt|garnetts: Dec might have done better to keep three diamonds in dummy and lead the Jack|pg||

nt|justin c: 3NT making for EW here, just about|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Not recommended in The Mysterious Multi|pg||
nt|peachy: 1D = 10-16 balanced|pg||
mb|p|nt|sheila a: would either of you be tempted to open 1@s?|pg||
nt|justin c: (available from all good bookshops :) )|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: South has a fine multi--North does not--an offensive weapon should not have two cast iron defensive tricks --and also the three cards in spades is an issue |pg||
nt|garnetts: swing to Wales here|pg||
nt|peachy: UNbalanced, sorry|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  against my religion to open 1@s|pg||

nt|justin c: 8 imps to wales for bidding 3NT on the board where N had long @C to the AQ and the @CK was doubleton onside|pg||

nt|greerm: West is pretty powerful now|pg||
nt|greerm: needs little but needs exact cards|pg||
nt|paulg:  unless his partner has the @dA, would need to discard partner's hearts on his clubs|pg||
nt|chessmaste: 2NT without a stopper is ambitious|pg||
nt|garnetts: I also agree with 2NT--even though it might well not work out well here|pg||
nt|justin c: hard to like double with the south cards|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|greerm: now Ian must guess that his void isn't working|pg||
nt|toobad: hard not to make a try|pg||
mb|p|pc|s8|nt|peachy: Many ways to raise hearts in this hand, I would have chosen a more descriptive one, either splinter or bid 1S to look for doublefit|pg||
pc|s2|nt|garnetts: maybe 3@H says I do not have a real stop --they can then grope |pg||
nt|garnetts: I have played that myself |pg||
nt|justin c: even after an indecently thorough grope, nowhere to go|pg||
pc|s9|nt|paulg:  this looks very normal and the fortunate spade and club positions means that it will always make|pg||
nt|greerm: 5@C is 0/3 I presume|pg||
nt|garnetts: west might not lead a heart--but he shoudl because he has nothing else much |pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|paulg:  and the fortunate diamond position|pg||
pc|h7|nt|diana1: so this lead lets him get rid of his @s loser|pg||
nt|paulg:  but I expect it will be flat across the event|pg||
nt|diana1: yes probably|pg||
nt|paulg:  the North hand has no entry to cash the spade|pg||
nt|toobad: yes|pg||
nt|greerm: key lead|pg||
nt|garnetts: not the best sequence of bids I have ever seen |pg||
pc|h2|nt|greerm: off now, i think ok on any other lead but suppose @HK natural|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|garnetts: but likely to make |pg||

nt|justin c: 10 imps to england when a @S was led against 4@H from @SKJxx|pg||
nt|justin c: (the one where a @S went on the @CA if you didnt cash @S immediately)|pg||
nt|garnetts: I think it was a well deserved swing then |pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  solid opener from Vi Outred that shows a limited hand with either clubs or diamonds|pg||
nt|paulg:  good result for NI in the Open Room|pg||
mb|1N|nt|sheila a: are you thinking of 1@d, Paul?|pg||
nt|paulg:  oh, she's decided it is 11-13 balanced ... which of course it is|pg||
nt|diana1: 3NT was missed in the other room with NS playing in 3@d|pg||
nt|paulg:  i don't think Matheson and Sime will bid the slam|pg||
nt|toobad: it would be a stretch |pg||
nt|peachy: 14-16|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|paulg:  even more solid then|pg||
nt|greerm: 2@S anyone?|pg||
nt|paulg:  3-card limit raise|pg||
nt|toobad: fit jump?|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  2@s showing a 3-card limit raise is very popular with the 5-card majorites here|pg||
nt|garnetts: we do try to argue for leads we really would make and not just those that work when we can see all of the hands |pg||
nt|garnetts: should be totally flat in 4@S |pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  very hard to bid 3NT when the opposition show hearts|pg||
nt|sheila a: is everybody playing transfers?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|justin c: 2@C = 4@H and another, or 5+@H|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|greerm: 13 imps to NI|pg||
nt|justin c: 2@D trying to play in the side suit, if there is one|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  the double showed 12-14 balanced|pg||
nt|garnetts: blimey |pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|nt|justin c: 2@H, just @H|pg||
nt|garnetts: 2@C appears to mean I have a long suit somewhere |pg||
pc|dT|nt|sheila a: the auction does kind of suggest @h are 4-4|pg||
nt|paulg:  unless 1@d was a transfer to hearts|pg||
nt|sheila a: 1@d might have been a sort of responsive double|pg||
nt|paulg:  yes, or just denying a 5-card major?|pg||
nt|sheila a: Vi wondering if there are 9 on top|pg||
nt|paulg:  to be honest I'd be wondering if there are 7 on top|pg||
nt|sheila a: Charles has bid quite strongly but clearly there were other, stronger bids he could have made|pg||
nt|diana1: as you said before Paul it is easy when we can see all 4 hands|pg||
nt|paulg:  if there is one leading style I abhor, then it is MUD in partner's suit|pg||

nt|frankaus: g'day all|pg||
pc|s4|nt|justin c: @S leads here?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|paulg:  a lot depends on what the redouble showed .. it may have been diamonds or a range|pg||
nt|garnetts: that double is far too agressive in my view although it might work |pg||
nt|garnetts: if you are going to lead that then double |pg||

pc|c4|pc|h6|pg||

nt|chick:  ** CAMROSE LIVE RESULTS ** http://bridge.silvertexter.eu  then browse results then 1o3.txt|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: I like the negative redouble here as east promising 0 or 1 in partner's suit--pass and double with balanced values |pg||
nt|chessmaste: 2@C looks like a transfer to diamonds|pg||
nt|garnetts: hearts break spades on  side -not reall problems in 3NT|pg||
mb|2N|nt|sheila a: 1@d is unbal with either minor, 1NT is a game force|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: West must be considering slam possibilities|pg||
mb|3C|nt|toobad: D or S?|pg||
nt|greerm: no reason to think of a @D|pg||
nt|greerm: hard to see how this will make, but 8 tricks there so....|pg||
nt|toobad: needs help|pg||
nt|greerm: defence might let him set up a @H trick ?|pg||
nt|diumraid: ** CAMROSE LIVE RESULTS ** http://bridge.silvertexter.eu  then browse results then 1o3.txt|pg||
nt|justin c: very fair, not set|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|paulg:  the defence has to be quite careful to beat this I think|pg||
nt|garnetts: Normal lead normal contract J@H normal play @C to the Q--then we can all go back to sleep for a while |pg||
mb|p|nt|greerm: North will have to find the @D suit soon|pg||
mb|3N|nt|paulg:  needs to switch to diamonds|pg||
nt|garnetts: I am truly amazed that West passed 4@S in the OR--must have failed to pay an entry fee |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|greerm: home now|pg||
nt|garnetts: the "@D bid did not have much appeal to be honest and anyway south has ignored it |pg||
nt|peachy: 1C was 11-13 balanced, or any 17+|pg||
nt|chick: looks like the same 11 tricks|pg||
pc|d7|nt|paulg:  in some relay systems south would have shown nothing about her hand on this auction|pg||
nt|paulg:  and it would do her no good at all this time|pg||
nt|sheila a: Unless West is put off leading a @s and tries a @c ...|pg||
nt|chick: especially with that lead|pg||
pc|d8|nt|chessmaste: That was a good (inspired?) decision by North to pass 3@H|pg||
pc|dA|nt|justin c: this is the last board of this set|pg||

pc|dK|nt|greerm: missed the "obvious " squeez that we can see|pg||
nt|garnetts: totally agree--North seems to be agressive mostly then suddenly makes a very conservative pass |pg||

pc|hK|nt|chessmaste: Still, South did not bid 2@S which would have shown a strong raise, so he knew the dummy would be modest|pg||
nt|garnetts: ttfn |pg||
pc|h6|nt|sheila a: hard to see any more than 7 tricks for declarer|pg||
nt|diana1: the EW played in 3@c-2|pg||
nt|diana1: 3@c-1|pg||
nt|sheila a: Sime judged to pass the W hand over 1NT|pg||
nt|sheila a: which made things simpler|pg||
nt|paulg:  if Vi takes theis and plays a spade, then West may feel it is necessary to cash @cA for down one|pg||
