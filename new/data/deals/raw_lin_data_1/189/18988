nt|barnets: 5@S will go quietly down 1|pg||
mb|d|nt|Walddk2: To to make at least|pg||
nt|jfaria:  a very close match, 1 imp diference|pg||
nt|galadriel: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|psyck: 2@s likely a weaker raise with 2@h a good raise|pg||
nt|glen: E has two choices: X, or 3@H|pg||
nt|psyck: with @sAx, @dK, @c doubleton, a sensible 2@s even with doubleton i suppose|pg||

mb|p|nt|tsadek: west need fit +K@C then he ask for aces|pg||
nt|pelu: here I prefer "Nt as transfer to @D (and 2@S for @C)|pg||
nt|jfaria:  weak nt and a rubish stayman by n|pg||
nt|vugraphpl8: http://www.poznan2011.pl/|pg||
mb|p|nt|glen: expect 2NT to be @D transfer, and 3@C = likes @Ds|pg||
nt|glen: and now W has to decide is it a good day for not vulnerable games|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: so 3@H = singleton|pg||
nt|pelu: diff when u have 2 singletons :)|pg||
nt|rado: hi all:)|pg||
nt|rado: @D lead and @S underlead Ak will beat it but unlikely|pg||
pc|cK|nt|jfaria:  just in time for an exciting board :)|pg||
nt|galadriel: Well, 5@S will make|pg||
nt|jfaria:  who could bid it?|pg||
nt|glen: W may think his 4@Ss means that E has a singleton or void|pg||
nt|jbgood: red card means not so quiet<.9|pg||
pc|c3|nt|galadriel: Do you think North should bid one more? Or is he worried to push them into makingslam?|pg||
nt|thenapster: hi all:)|pg||
nt|psyck: true, but as u said, since NV, he passes|pg||
nt|barnets: just 2 imps|pg||
pc|c6|nt|vugraphpl8: http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/osw2t1-1.htm|pg||
nt|psyck: Hi Lotan|pg||
nt|thenapster: we are going to see very agressive style by the Danish pair|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|jfaria:  NS found a good suit and 3nt looks noraml|pg||
nt|pelu: so a X from the hand with no tricks|pg||
pc|cA|nt|vugraphpl8: http://www.poznan2011.pl/|pg||
pc|c8|nt|pelu: NL in 7@d in CR|pg||
nt|pelu: standard bidding : 3@D tranfer, 3NT pass/correct, and 4@C = cue with good @hs|pg||
nt|vugraphpl8: now it's ok|pg||
pc|c4|pc|s7|pg||
nt|vugraphpl8: LEV: sory partner|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|galadriel: From is point of view, 6 of minor could be on|pg||
nt|glen: hi Krishna, Lotan|pg||
nt|psyck: will be tough to match the aggresion of Meckwell sitting same seats other table :)|pg||
nt|thenapster: :)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|galadriel: his|pg||
nt|jfaria:  think the light opening by W succeeded|pg||
pc|s3|nt|glen: what was that about fines for slow play, how about fines for slow bidding?|pg||
nt|tsadek: I like Verhees bid of 3@S in closed room , Force his pd to bid 4@C with K@C|pg||
nt|pelu: not easy when two players from so dif nations and diff style play together|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|jfaria:  my connection is so slow that i fear commenting one game after the one is played :(|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C|nt|Walddk2: and we welcome yet another Bessis, brother/son, Olivier|pg||
nt|brolucius: A very rare situation. Not many sons would partner their father at this level.|pg||
mb|1D|nt|brolucius: I could have survived around 8 boards, partnering my mother, but no more. |pg||
nt|fokal: hi all|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|fokal: yeah, me neither :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: 1@D, rather than a double, is the modern action on the North hand. He plans to double (if available) next time round.|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|henryb:  I, on the other hand, take great pleasure in playing with my son as often as circumstances permit|pg||
nt|athene: south could have bid 2@D over the double|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think I would double on my first turn. Any views, panel?|pg||
nt|henryb:  X|pg||
nt|brolucius: Many players would have raised to 2@D on the South cards. Why not?|pg||
mb|3D|nt|athene: it's normal to bid a 5-card major first time rather than double, but not so sure about a 5-card minor|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|fokal: red against white, he didn't want his partner to go wild|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d2|pc|d5|pc|dK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He has a great hand if they have a fit|pg||
pc|h3|nt|fokal: which whould surely have happened here|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2@D doesn't show any more than that, because he can cue-bid 2@C to show a sound raise.|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h7|nt|athene: well there's quite a bit of room between 2@D and wildness; partner should be able to show a good hand below the stratosphere|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d3|pc|d8|pc|dT|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h8|pc|hQ|pg||

pc|h5|pc|h6|pc|dA|pc|hK|pg||
nt|fokal: with N hand , it would be still hard to stop quitely in 3D|pg||
nt|henryb:  Some of us might say "when I have very little, I bid very little - Pass"|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|brolucius: Or 'when I have a fit, I raise!'|pg||

nt|jfaria:  obviously N was afraid of doing something weird|pg||
nt|galadriel: These high level decisions are so difficult|pg||
nt|jbgood: couldnt agree more, Peter|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|glen: we the mention of meckwell we are now down to 2 specs|pg||
nt|psyck: lol|pg||
mb|1C|nt|rado: again some action with all hands non-balanced|pg||
nt|rado: N may bid @C 1st hoping to introduce @S later by DBL , or direct start with DBL|pg||
mb|d|nt|pelu: I am told that some play that 3@H = 3+ @hs and 3Nt a mild slam-invite|pg||
mb|p|an|.|nt|vugraphpl8: http://www.poznan2011.pl/|pg||
nt|vugraphpl8: all bbo tables - http://www.bridgebase.com/mobile/index.php?r=348267|pg||
nt|pelu: a lot of @Ds NS on a non @D-lead|pg||
mb|1D|nt|thenapster: the danish pair is playing 4h in borad number 1...probably 5 imps for the amercians as a start|pg||
nt|bigtrain: alot = less than 11 though  :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: yes 10 :)|pg||
nt|pelu: what now 3@D by N or more?|pg||
nt|jbgood: 2@c perhaps? take it that is just forcing|pg||
nt|pelu: Bessis-bessis in 3@d|pg||
nt|bigtrain: obvious;y needs to advance with some care as 1@D is suspect|pg||
mb|4C|an|.|nt|jfaria:  @d keep being a safe rescue for nt oppeners .)|pg||
mb|p|nt|alok_daga: Hi all|pg||
nt|galadriel: They will get to 3NT here|pg||
nt|galadriel: which is a tricky contract|pg||
nt|galadriel: plenty of HCP but no real source of tricks|pg||
nt|jfaria:  y, trick power in every suit|pg||
nt|jfaria:  probably will get a favourable lead|pg||
nt|jbgood: he did bid @cs...|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|rado: hi|pg||
nt|barnets: if they dont lead trump|pg||
nt|pelu: as I see: ned a @D lead to defeat 4@d|pg||
nt|barnets: they may make 10|pg||
nt|pelu: @D lead in OR|pg||
nt|barnets: they made just 3|pg||
nt|jbgood: after this sequence a trump lead stands out here too|pg||
nt|jbgood: but Rod hasnt passed yet|pg||
nt|pelu: not so easy for West to play @D wery aften first @CA - and then too late|pg||
nt|jbgood: a kib says: He thinks now to bid 3NT...:)|pg||
nt|pelu: but the 4@C bid sh help him|pg||
nt|barnets: that would not work|pg||
nt|pelu: 3Nt could be the winning spot - not here, but thats I dont like 4@C and prefer 3@c by N|pg||
mb|4H|nt|pelu: but with 6HCOP East could never invite for slam - so prob a misunderstanding - we will prov know later|pg||
nt|athene: hi good morning everyone|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|nt|glen: some partnerships have given up game invites on the N type hands, just blast 4@S and hope the unknown nature of the hand can help|pg||
nt|psyck: 4@h had play, but mostly double dummy, so as you say, likely -1|pg||
nt|thenapster: not a good descion to bid 4cl..that will go -3 instead of 3sp down|pg||
nt|glen: it don't like 4@C on the 3-2-2-6|pg||
mb|p|nt|glen: here the 3@h and then 4@S indicates a stonger idea|pg||
nt|jfaria:  big swing first board|pg||
mb|p|nt|brotherp: hi all|pg||
nt|brotherp: lets see if Denmark can come back|pg||
mb|p|nt|glen: but hard for N to find the perfect cards in the S hand for slam|pg||
nt|pelu: will EW start X now?|pg||
nt|barnets: looks like they are too high|pg||
nt|pelu: no|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|glen: good duck at trick 1|pg||
nt|pelu: pl Kibs - can u tell: was 3Nt slaminvite or just Pass/correct?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: what the heck is a zt penalty?|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|glen: greco-hampson (in another match) reached 3@S|pg||
nt|galadriel: They got X'd in 5@S in other room for 850|pg||
nt|jfaria:  double game swing outch!|pg||
nt|galadriel: Interestingly, it was South who competed to 5@S|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Both pairs play Precision. I think I can find EW's CC, one moment|pg||
nt|bigtrain: sorry|pg||
nt|bigtrain: privaye|pg||
nt|bigtrain: private|pg||
pc|sK|nt|glen: now what does S do?|pg||
nt|jbgood: no need to say this will not make - but all of a sudden you see defenders going astray - not here though|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|d4|nt|jbgood: nice return|pg||
pc|d2|nt|glen: and their opps did likewise|pg||
pc|d5|nt|brotherp: hi joao|pg||
nt|pelu: S could play @ss himself for a trrick to @s9|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|h3|nt|thenapster: so 5-0 for Maheffey after the first board of the segment|pg||
nt|psyck: The @h's not dgood enuf, so while the 1st endplay worked, 2nd will not help |pg||
nt|psyck: so likely -2 now|pg||
nt|thenapster: yes|pg||
pc|h4|nt|alok_daga: the last hand,a pretty hand 2 defeat 5hrts,wud require gud defence|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2009BermudaBowlBrazil/bermudabowl/norway/groetheim-tundal.pdf|pg||
pc|h7|nt|jfaria:  with a @d lead things would have been harder|pg||

nt|jfaria:  hi Wiebe|pg||

nt|jfaria:  "wrong sided" in open got a @d lead|pg||
nt|glen: yikes to that X|pg||
nt|twcho: I guess they are not native German but immigrants from other countries|pg||
mb|5D|nt|glen: wow|pg||
nt|pelu: if so, then 4@s stronger than 3@s|pg||
nt|glen: or in this case, reverse wow|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the funny thing is the light to wild openings don't seem to ever work, one wonders the attraction|pg||
nt|alok_daga: Query,wud u sell 2 a 2dmnds or xle from Easts hand?P marked with strength|pg||
nt|rado: Declarer mau like @c continuation|pg||
nt|athene: @CA10 is pretty good support|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: :)|pg||
nt|psyck: it would not occur to me for sure at this vul|pg||
nt|athene: given partner has bid the suit twice|pg||
nt|fokal: here they can make 6 @c (even 7 ! ). Can they reach it ?|pg||
nt|fokal: 4 @c will defnetly help|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: sure they will bid 6@c|pg||
nt|athene: 4@D rkcb?|pg||
mb|d|nt|fabsayc: east does not have a second bid|pg||
nt|rado: 3 rounds of @C now|pg||
nt|jbgood: a bit too much by doubling first and then 3@s afterwards?|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: its difficult - I dont expect many tables will bid this slam|pg||
nt|brotherp: declarer will go after @h's|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 4@C surprises me a bit with 5422 minimum...  thats why i expected 3@D|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 4@D = rkc|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 4NT = 2 no Q|pg||
nt|barnets: now rod has to guess hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|jfaria:  E and N bidding @h first meaning @s |pg||
mb|p|pc|sA|nt|galadriel: West would be ruffing with his natural trump trick|pg||
nt|pelu: Smirnow from Russia and Piekarek from Poland|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|nt|pelu: how can u ask with void in H?|pg||
nt|athene: i guess meckstroth decided that after his partner showed extras *and* rebiddable clubs, 5@C was going to be safe, despite the poor diamond holding|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|jbgood: so i was wrong - again:)|pg||
nt|bigtrain: they don't have exclusion available in the auction|pg||
nt|barnets: low heart ?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|fokal: everybody told, 6 they bid for sure|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s7|pc|d6|pg||
nt|barnets: maybe the 6 is better|pg||
nt|barnets: than the J|pg||
nt|barnets: wanting east to bounce|pg||
nt|barnets: with the ace|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Thomas played the 6 in tempo|pg||
nt|jbgood: will he find it?|pg||
nt|barnets: if he plays the J easier for east to play low|pg||
nt|jbgood: E has bid as if he owns the deck - so perhaps he may have @h A and Q|pg||
nt|barnets: with the ace of course|pg||
nt|pelu: but the both play for Germany now|pg||
nt|barnets: east has shown a very strong hand on bidding|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Declarer knows East has the @SAK, and by inference has the minor suit kings - no club switch|pg||
nt|barnets: and west a little something|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Yes Mark, but East has not revealed @SQ|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Would West raise with just four trumps and maybe a couple of queens? He might|pg||
pc|h6|nt|alok_daga: If u follow Mike Lawrence he shud be competing!|pg||
nt|galadriel: last trick for the defence|pg||
pc|h7|nt|jfaria:  1 imp back|pg||
nt|Walddk4: He could have @HA instead of the two queens|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
nt|brotherp: short of a chinese finesse|pg||
nt|athene: hard when your useful void is in partner's first-bid suit|pg||
nt|fokal: let me tell to the kibs, that the players don't see the 4 hands , even the world masters|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cQ|nt|psyck: unless they play weak NT, S could have invited after 2@s|pg||

pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||

nt|brolucius: There were two huge problems on the previous board: (a) bidding 5@D and (b) making 5@D. They achieved both.|pg||

mb|1H|nt|athene: it's possible, but he might have done something more|pg||

nt|athene: he didn't really imagine he would actually score up 5@D|pg||
nt|brolucius: If you play Support Doubles, a 2@H rebid denies three spades.|pg||

mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|nt|fokal: 5@d making with 13 facing 3 points, good result !!|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|fokal: lol , dthey were already lucky enough|pg||
nt|athene: north didn't want to pull the double to 2@S given east had bid those but it was surely a possibility|pg||
pc|dK|pc|h6|pc|d4|pg||
nt|athene: one interesting point of carding is when you lead an honour for a ruffing finesse|pg||
nt|athene: how do you show your solid sequence and give suit preference too?|pg||
nt|henryb:  I am not sure they can beat this|pg||
nt|fokal: yes good point|pg||
nt|athene: many good pairs play Q/10 is high and J/9 is low|pg||
nt|fokal: by the way here in 2 @h it seems declarer needs to find the @c Q|pg||
pc|c8|nt|fokal: but N might help by playing @s|pg||

mb|1S|nt|alok_daga: Shud be dead push,this brd|pg||
nt|thenapster: 16+|pg||
nt|athene: rodwell just decided to go with the odds - that one of partner's keycards was the @HA|pg||
mb|2D|nt|psyck: S passes to show some 0-4 maybe|pg||
nt|glen: S will pass as many times as legal on the auction|pg||
nt|bigtrain: well i guess they could jump to 5@H but that commits them to slam :)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|pelu: Denmark and Hungary (against Monaco) bid 6@s|pg||
nt|glen: how good was the 6@H contract?|pg||
nt|glen: with @D KT doubleton, was nice layout|pg||
nt|rado: now some quiet board 4@S for just|pg||
nt|brotherp: sort off a @s-partial for NS; wonder if they will enter the bidding though|pg||
nt|barnets: south made a X of 2@H that put huge pressure on partner|pg||
mb|p|nt|tsadek: 6@H will be great from N side|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1@C = 16+|pg||
mb|p|nt|glen: or runout to @Cs|pg||
nt|psyck: most play some artificial bids on strong @c, but 1@d not alerted|pg||
nt|glen: EW is a sponsor-pro partnership, and they tend to try to keep things error free, let the meckwells win the imps|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@D = nat|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: 2@S overcall might cause a little more trouble|pg||
nt|fokal: well I have to say that it's quite surprising that they didn't reach that slam after the 4 @c bid, but I was still though to give value to the void in partner suit|pg||
nt|athene: but he decided the risk/reward ratio not good enough|pg||
mb|p|nt|galadriel: This may not be everyone's opening|pg||
nt|jfaria:  6 on a finesse?|pg||
nt|galadriel: And will probably get them to slam|pg||
nt|jfaria:  well EW got kucky with a light opening first board|pg||
nt|galadriel: My view is that, if it is your partnership style to open these hands, that's fine, but the system must have good brakes|pg||
nt|jfaria:  hard to stY OU NOW, WITH W HAND|pg||
nt|jfaria:  sry capps|pg||
nt|glen: oh, S did not run out|pg||
nt|jfaria:  Denmark must feel loosing some ground but they r dealing with avery tuff pair in this room|pg||
nt|pelu: ok a bet: this time NS will bid slam :)|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@H is nat (coincidentally) asking|pg||
mb|2S|nt|bigtrain: meckwell are fairly conservative slam bidders|pg||
nt|athene: "there are lots of ways to win imps with +680" as meckstroth says in his book :)|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2NT = any 3fit|pg||
mb|d|nt|rado: :)|pg||
nt|psyck: yeah, quite a view|pg||
nt|psyck: S not liking his options at all|pg||
nt|psyck: 3@c could be too high, with 2@d going down|pg||
nt|pelu: 2 @D ruff will set up @D then no need to find @cQ|pg||
mb|p|nt|glen: he could now bid 1@C - that would get partner to stop these doubles and play the contract|pg||
nt|jbgood: the axe in this room too|pg||
mb|p|nt|jfaria:  nebulous @d opening in precision|pg||
mb|p|nt|jfaria:  all this must be scientific and of c forcing|pg||
nt|galadriel: I guess 2@C is GF|pg||
nt|vugraphpl8: http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/or321t7-2.htm|pg||
nt|Walddk5: 1@H is 4+ spades or a GF relay|pg||
nt|brotherp: meck bid game as expected in the open room; Denmark need to get something going|pg||
nt|barnets: so can he make it ?|pg||
nt|jbgood: yes - this may just make - for a double game swing|pg||
nt|barnets: he can afford 2 trump losers and 3 clubs|pg||
nt|pelu: but for sure I like the 2@s bid better than the agrressive pass by Thomas in OR|pg||
nt|jbgood: yes - much better |pg||
nt|barnets: h does not have atrump to lead|pg||
nt|barnets: that is always bad|pg||
nt|barnets: as a trump lead is standout|pg||
nt|pelu: @H lead and then @D to A and @Dq?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|Walddk1: 2 segments of 14 boards in the R32, R16, QF and SF. 3 x 16 in the finals on Wednesday|pg||
nt|glen: it is like the pass over 1@D showed some values|pg||
nt|psyck: i dont understand 3N at all, N already showed his hand|pg||
nt|brotherp: and this is not what they need - although u might say opps have missed game (5@D seems unbiddable though)|pg||
nt|bigtrain: meck has a rule...  the 480-50 rule|pg||
nt|barnets: sorry wrong hand on lead|pg||
nt|jbgood: even if he goes 1 down it is a tenner gained|pg||
nt|barnets: just 5 tumps to lead :)\|pg||

nt|galadriel: I somehow don't think that will happen...|pg||
nt|thenapster: no dbl no trouble|pg||
nt|psyck: 3@c could have even made with @h fin , this is prayerless|pg||
nt|brotherp: difficult for West to rightly appraise the bare @h Ace|pg||
pc|d9|nt|fokal: 4@s was rkcb in @h ?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: meck has a rule - "the 460-50 rule" it's much better to be +480 then -50|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 580-50|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 480-50|pg||
pc|d4|nt|jfaria:  good thing 4 N nerves, he must stil be depressed by B15|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|pelu: need on 3 entries: @S-ruff, @HA and later @CK|pg||
pc|d2|nt|rado: Defense should continue @H to stop overtrick now|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 4@S is RKC here|pg||
nt|pelu: this 2 teams realy like to entertain kibs - 111 IMPs in 1. segment, and here we go again|pg||
nt|jbgood: the difference between going 1 down and making is a mere 6 IMPs|pg||
nt|april7: hand and 2 aces*|pg||
nt|barnets: well @D hook @D ruff is 4 @HA ruff is 6 and 2 trumps are 8|pg||
nt|pelu: GIB: 8 tricks in @S for Ns - and GIB is better than me :)|pg||
pc|s3|pc|d3|pg||
nt|jfaria:  can see nothing besides @d hook|pg||
nt|galadriel: Nor can I|pg||

nt|galadriel: there|pg||
pc|s5|nt|galadriel: Also, if you click on movie you can see all the results of the match - click on open room|pg||

pc|c3|nt|alok_daga: Mansfield proved right yet again,5level belongs 2 opponent.5hrts=1dwn thus this 300 the best they cud do|pg||
nt|alok_daga: actually on cl Q lead 4hrts also dwn?|pg||
nt|thenapster: nope|pg||

nt|thenapster: like the semi finals..|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|pg||
nt|pelu: diff - even with open cards - to find more that 7 tricks for N|pg||
nt|jbgood: it is makeable, but first hurdle is clubs|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cQ|nt|athene: sometimes you delay playing the critical suit to find out which defender might have Jxxx|pg||
pc|cK|nt|thenapster: thats the way it was in the mixed i played last week|pg||
nt|brotherp: next hand|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|athene: here he is always going to play king then ace of spades so can only pick up four with rodwell, so that doesn't really apply|pg||
nt|athene: but it doesn't hurt anyway|pg||
nt|pelu: 11 IMP to Bessis from board 2: here NS bid and made 5@D (here 4@h-1 by EW)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: In the women's final, Turkey are walking all over the mighty Dutch ladies. 51 IMPs up! And in the seniors, Grenthe (France) is 50 ahead against Pharon (England/Sweden)|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h5|pc|hK|pc|h3|pg||
pc|c8|pc|d9|pc|cT|nt|glen: once declarer takes the first 5 tricks here, there is a shortage of more tricks|pg||
nt|psyck: The biggest upset in R32 was Texan Aces (silver & bronze winners in previous Euro opens) defeating Monaco Z (Helgemo, Helness, Balicki, Zmudzinski,...) by a narrow 2 imps after ...|pg||
nt|psyck: trailing by 34 imps in 1st half.|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|glen: 6 tricks|pg||
pc|d4|nt|glen: but here it looks like a @H, 3@C, @S and a @D for the defense|pg||
nt|glen: aside from the @S Q|pg||
nt|glen: what the something, the texans (not from texas) won?|pg||
nt|glen: they were getting killed when Z was in|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dQ|pc|dA|pg||
pc|s9|nt|jfaria:  J @c is only a iluson as an entry|pg||
nt|barnets: west should have ret a heart|pg||
nt|jbgood: looks like it is a sure downer now...|pg||
nt|barnets: but still ok|pg||
nt|vugraphpl8: so our final is the most exciting|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|nt|glen: that leaves Monaco A holding the flag|pg||
nt|psyck: The sponser of Texan Aces lives in Texas USA & is called Texas...they had a lucky comeback indeed|pg||
nt|psyck: It is a completely Indian team with Texas also of Indian origin|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|pelu: wd by East - if he dont ruff easy win|pg||

pc|c5|nt|psyck: :)|pg||
pc|h2|pc|d5|pc|s3|pg||
pc|dK|nt|pelu: but only what we could expect from 2 topteams|pg||
pc|h6|nt|jfaria:  and Skorchev must be really unhappy with N defence|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d7|pg||
mc|8|nt|jbgood: 15 imps back|pg||

mb|1C|an|.|nt|fokal: great job by smirnoff-piekarek to bid and make 5 @d|pg||

mb|p|mb|4H|nt|pelu: if max 18 the very optimist 2NT?|pg||
mb|p|nt|glen: declarer will punch out the @S ace|pg||
nt|jfaria:  think they r very closee to bidding this one|pg||
nt|brotherp: 2@S might be clubs; and 2NT might be pre-accept with an honor....but then again not knowing their agreements that's just a wild guess|pg||
nt|jfaria:  2@s = @c and now S is describing his shape i'm told|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2NT is natural invite|pg||
nt|pelu: ok that make sense|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i believe Meckwell play 2nt response to 1nt opener as asking for a 5-card major, but maybe 1nt on this sequence denies a 5-card major|pg||
nt|bigtrain: excuse me///  noticed 4th seat|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 18-19|pg||
nt|bigtrain: no it doesn't|pg||
mb|p|nt|brotherp: seems impossible for south to bid 6 ..not holding any ace|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@D = 3fit 5-7|pg||
pc|c7|nt|jfaria:  a mild slam try by S but that's it|pg||
nt|jfaria:  killing lead|pg||
nt|jbgood: club lead in the other room made things sort of easy|pg||

pc|c3|nt|pelu: the slam in 24 (6@h) bid by 11 out of 26|pg||
nt|rado: declarer will need Opps to touch @D suit to make this otherwise down 1|pg||

pc|cA|pg||

nt|vugraphpl8: sr 5 d|pg||
nt|vugraphpl8: sry|pg||

pc|hA|nt|glen: and end with more than enough tricks|pg||

pc|h9|pc|h7|nt|pelu: now u owe me a drink, Glen :)|pg||
nt|galadriel: So, Tundal will get his ruff and must score a @D trick to st it|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hK|pg||
nt|galadriel: set|pg||
nt|bigtrain: meckwell's NT ranges are 14-16 1/2/3NV & 15-17 3V/4|pg||
pc|cK|nt|galadriel: 8 boards to play, and nothing in it - very exciting!|pg||
pc|c6|nt|pelu: or 2 :)|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c5|pg||
nt|bigtrain: thus since this is fourth seat 1@C-1@D//1NT = 18-19|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cT|nt|barnets: this is not best|pg||
pc|h8|pc|c9|pg||
nt|athene: declarer only has 8 obvious tricks but east can be thrown in to lead a diamond, i guess|pg||
nt|barnets: now a spade is down|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s5|nt|pelu: some kibs ask for the play in the match for 3. place - I looks like they are not playing the same boards - it when the running score tells so|pg||
nt|barnets: rodwell had a difficult decision |pg||
pc|s9|pc|sK|pg||
nt|alok_daga: Reqd passive defence|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@H and @S = endplay on E|pg||
nt|pelu: still endplay for 9 tricks|pg||
nt|athene: when the @SK gets ducked you tend to assume east is more likely to have the ace|pg||
nt|fokal: with the fast duck, declarer might think as of @s is onside. |pg||
nt|jbgood: Piekarek - Smirnov still bidding  3 next door|pg||
nt|fokal: yes. But the position is not clear|pg||
nt|fokal: cashing could easily go wrong|pg||
nt|athene: east can see that if he wins the @SA he will probably get thrown in with a spade later|pg||
nt|pelu: Ns in 6@c B3|pg||
nt|jbgood: and 6@c reached in OR|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d3|nt|athene: so he ducks to try to just deceive declarer|pg||
nt|barnets: whether to play two top hearts|pg||
nt|barnets: or cross and finesse|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|pg||
nt|fokal: wd rodwell|pg||

nt|Walddk2: It's in 2@S by N-S|pg||
nt|fokal: oh ho|pg||
nt|fokal: they didn't escape in 2NT then :)|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Although the final is longer than the other rounds, it is not THAT long. Still very difficult to peg back a lead of 3+ game swings.|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|athene: do NS play that completing a transfer shows a fit, or denies a fit, or ambiguous?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They were unable to after pass, pass, pass :)|pg||
mb|3N|nt|fokal: shows|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: if you are going to play it specific i think 3@S here should deny a fit, that way you only force to game when at least you have a 5-3 fit|pg||
pc|h5|nt|brolucius: Something in that, Bill, but it is incredibly rare for 3@S to be passed.|pg||
nt|athene: but probably either way is better than the traditional 3major = most hands|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h6|pc|h4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Board 20 may cost Bessis half a flat in Mayfair, London. 2@S is makeable|pg||

nt|jfaria:  So the Danes bid game on board 18, not a good game but one that makes :)|pg||
nt|brotherp: opportunities yet again|pg||
nt|athene: when you lead the @SK you are pretty much sure to have KQ or so|pg||
nt|athene: so a defender over you with the ace can duck and he knows it probably won't cost|pg||
nt|barnets: but it could be a singleton|pg||
nt|barnets: easy for us all here to make it|pg||
nt|barnets: seeing 4 hands|pg||
mb|2N|nt|galadriel: precision style|pg||
nt|jfaria:  precision 2@c|pg||
nt|thenapster: flat 3nt here|pg||
nt|glen: meckwell could very well open this S hand 1NT|pg||
nt|ritong: in the other room, east opened the bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: but if the defender under you has the ace he might be a bit more worried|pg||
mb|3H|an|.|mb|p|nt|pelu: so 3 board and 32 IMP :)|pg||
nt|athene: if you had only KQx, say, then it might cost a trick|pg||
mb|3S|nt|fokal: Thomas was looking for a @s weaker than the 2 but he only had the Jack|pg||
mb|p|nt|glen: it seems that NS use 1NT as a game force relay|pg||
mb|3N|nt|fokal: so he had to cash it :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|glen: they will ask 84 questions, then reach 3NT|pg||
nt|ritong: making things a bit easier|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 19-20 2NT here|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: an interesting treatment indeed|pg||
mb|p|nt|galadriel: 3NT can't make on a @S lead|pg||
nt|jfaria:  @s lead.. only count 8 tricks|pg||
nt|galadriel: But after 1NT- 3NT in other room, East led a natural @C|pg||
nt|jfaria:  my mac is rather slow today|pg||
nt|jfaria:  big swing|pg||
nt|thenapster: so south will show 11-14 with 5332 and north will bid 3nt|pg||
nt|glen: 3NT is interesting, with 8 top tricks|pg||
nt|psyck: doesn't matter here, but we will wait & see if it makes a difference in the coming deals|pg||
nt|glen: specs voting for XX to play here|pg||
nt|psyck: he can simply play @h for 9th trick in 3N on this bidding rather than trying @d|pg||
nt|brotherp: reaching 6@H seems likely now|pg||
nt|ritong: west*|pg||
pc|dA|nt|galadriel: This auction gave West the chance to overcall @S|pg||
nt|galadriel: Ah!|pg||
nt|glen: now E is feeling the heat|pg||
nt|psyck: E wondering what the 2@h x was all about|pg||
pc|d5|nt|pelu: only 3 top-losers in 4@s but not 10 tricks|pg||
nt|glen: E hunting for a number here|pg||
nt|jfaria:  again the slow approach may help E to bid on|pg||
nt|brotherp: 6@H very interesting - after D!A lead u might play for the C!K to be offside - making for a very complicated hand|pg||
nt|brotherp: looks like a possible trump-squeeze ending|pg||
nt|barnets: a spec asks did east really play a low @D with KJ|pg||
pc|d8|nt|brotherp: w ending with @s J9 , 1 trump and 2 clubs|pg||

nt|brotherp: btw sorry for the comments with the ! ---still not completely used to the interface|pg||
nt|jfaria:  that would be a line for  a jr on a jamed VG :)|pg||
nt|brotherp: east has a very big hand looking at the bidding|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|galadriel: now it's ok|pg||
nt|glen: he passes in reasonable tempo to keep his pd's options open|pg||
nt|psyck: S opens @h, they gf, pd surely can't be wanting to penalize 2@h...but E is the one with @h void :)|pg||
nt|barnets: it seems very odd|pg||
nt|barnets: when he had it down 1|pg||
nt|vugraphpl8: yes he really played small diamond with KJ|pg||
pc|s8|nt|glen: gives up beer card early, never a good idea|pg||
nt|psyck: specs get their wish|pg||
nt|glen: in polish methods, to save beer card, the lead the @D 2|pg||
nt|glen: *they lead|pg||
pc|s3|nt|glen: if N can open that hand type in 3rd seat, S should not bid bidding 3@H on a 3-3-3-4|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s2|pg||
nt|galadriel: I can understand West - he had a second 5 card major - may have been a surprise for declarer, who obviously had a @S stop|pg||
pc|c6|nt|glen: its hard to see W taking 6@H tricks here|pg||
nt|jfaria:  Lev told his story|pg||
nt|brotherp: still lev might go for beauty and play the trump-squeeze way|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|nt|rado: good stop by EW, 5@C needs @D finesse|pg||
nt|alok_daga: prediction.this brd will cost IMPS|pg||

nt|jbgood: @d = overtrick, @s = , @c = o/t |pg||

pc|s7|nt|glen: i have no idea why the @D switch was tempting|pg||

nt|fokal: you could almost make 3NT in EW here, but you don't have the point and opponants might play in @s|pg||
mb|3D|nt|henryb:  The first set, over 100 imps in 16 boards, was high scoring. They are not slowing down|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: North reluctant to raise on that shape. I am not surprised. Wow, he has bid 4@S.|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 4@S must be an advance sac - but against what?|pg||
pc|dT|nt|athene: is he worried opps will suddenly discover 4@H or something?|pg||
nt|henryb:  against the cold 3N or 5@d E-W|pg||
nt|fokal: In 3NT ew, you have to guess the heart |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Oliv, is 2@S forcing?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I guess not|pg||
nt|fokal: no it's weak with @s|pg||
nt|henryb:  In 3N also|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@S with that shape at love all is some view|pg||
nt|brolucius: Very surprising.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Lucky not to be doubled|pg||

mb|p|nt|pelu: 800 if !§H10 - but only a diff of 2IMP|pg||

nt|thenapster: looks like 1400|pg||

nt|alok_daga: seems xxle=bid your next suit,thus 2dmnds=dmnds+another.cant think of anything else|pg||
nt|glen: 11 high card points, game unlikely|pg||
nt|brotherp: smooting lead for declarer|pg||
nt|pelu: a very lucky layout for EW - when @HQJ drop there are 11 tricks for EW in @d|pg||
nt|ritong: unexpected|pg||
pc|c7|nt|barnets: this could make|pg||
pc|c2|nt|brotherp: kind of hands and leads u want being ahead|pg||
nt|jfaria:  hugly cards in Lev's hand, but good position of K @S still a hope|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|rado: maybe our kibs from Netherlands will help?|pg||
nt|psyck: OK, now I understand what Lotan meant when he said we can expect some aggresion by NS|pg||
nt|brotherp: not finessing risky with @d 6-2|pg||
nt|jfaria:  think E is in control|pg||
nt|brotherp: wonder if he can read @d 4-lead|pg||
nt|bigtrain: trick slams are the toughest to bid|pg||
nt|fokal: oups|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|jfaria:  at this time i guess E already knows about W @h |pg||
nt|galadriel: strong @C auctions are very useful in these hands as they allow lots of room for exploration|pg||
nt|jfaria:  indeed|pg||
nt|athene: maybe if Rodwell had bid 4@C or 4@H over 3NT (good hand for spades) they might get there|pg||
nt|bigtrain: he's not good enough for 4@C but he could make the bid if he had a better hand|pg||
nt|jbgood: everything friendly here, so will make them all|pg||
nt|fokal: does 3 @s shows support ?|pg||
nt|athene: if he would super-accept 3@H with most 4-card support then i think he is really max for spades|pg||
nt|jbgood: or "may" perhaps more correct|pg||
nt|fokal: and 2NT is 20-21 ?|pg||
nt|athene: if you just count points he only nas 19 but really that is not your average 19 count|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 19-20|pg||
nt|fokal: ok|pg||
nt|jbgood: kibs suggest 4@c over 3 NT... N's hand very suitbale|pg||
nt|fokal: in that case he is maximum indeed|pg||
nt|pelu: only 4@H in OR so 13 more|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cJ|nt|jfaria:  with no oposition i guess they will reach 6|pg||
nt|galadriel: the @H10 is a big card :)|pg||
nt|jbgood: think it will - he cannot play S for 5 hearts?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|jfaria:  better in @h, any imp may become precious|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|galadriel: Indeed|pg||
nt|athene: ona  4-1 spade break you might still survive in slam even on a diamond lead - need @CK onside and the four trumps to have 3 hearts|pg||
nt|pelu: 45 IMP after 4 boards - that only prove, that also top-players make mistakes - and it has been some difficult board|pg||
nt|athene: then you can get both of south's diamonds away in time|pg||
nt|athene: the key to slam being so good is having two long suits to run, and a 4@C cue would not show that, but if he could bid 4@H showing a trick source and a big hand for spades...that ...|pg||
nt|athene: might do the job|pg||
nt|barnets: must guess hearts|pg||
pc|cT|nt|glen: 3NT in the other room is one of those few 3NT contracts where there are 8 tricks, but almost no hope of 9|pg||
pc|s3|pc|h4|nt|athene: but then of course south would be worried about the @CAK :)|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|galadriel: well done|pg||
nt|jfaria:  no swing in sight|pg||
nt|jfaria:  correction, can make 7|pg||
nt|galadriel: They had one more round of bidding here|pg||
nt|jfaria:  just guessing, but after the happy finding of K@h declarer will play for a split in the reds missing|pg||
nt|brotherp: luckily everything works|pg||
nt|fokal: agreed athene|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s5|nt|jfaria:  he must pray|pg||
nt|pelu: NS can take the fist 3 tricks and then rest for decl|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sA|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|pc|h2|nt|psyck: I would double 1@c too with decent holdings in other suits, but bidding again would occur to very few|pg||
nt|barnets: still a guess|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|jfaria:  putting @d Q with N|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h7|pc|hA|nt|jfaria:  and God is on his side|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|galadriel: A kib is just reminding me that EW were on the Norwegian team that won the Bermuda bowl, so they are no strangers to pressure|pg||
pc|hT|pc|c5|pc|h6|pc|h9|pg||
nt|pelu: very normal - when u have 8 tricks in yopur hand - u hope for the 9. by partner - I like 3Nt by East|pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|nt|fokal: good point|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Phew, I got the 16 IMPs right, no correction needed|pg||
nt|brolucius: At least the 2@H doubled and made has lept the score interesting. We could still be in for some dramatic ending.|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2H|mb|2S|nt|henryb:  With everything onside, and @h breaking, I guess 4@h can be made|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Another bold re-opening double.|pg||
nt|athene: the layout which is nice for 4@H is also nasty for 2@SX|pg||
nt|henryb:  Or they can collect 500 here|pg||
nt|athene: not that P. will pass, surely|pg||
nt|Walddk2: IMPs flying around the room. Another two-digit swing coming on 21|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 10 or 11 to Bessis|pg||
nt|brolucius: That is partly because some of the bidding has the air of a match-point game.|pg||
mb|2N|nt|fokal: it was expected , with the 1100 score|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|brolucius: 2NT probably a scramble bid.|pg||
nt|henryb:  even 3N will make|pg||
nt|dburn: not sure what East is supposed to make of this - is Lev showing a good hand?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Exactly. It is difficult for him.|pg||
nt|brolucius: That is one of the problems with borderline re-opening doubles.|pg||
nt|athene: if east thought 2nt was lebensohl then west's bidding 3@H rather than 3@C as requested, must show a good hand, i suppose|pg||
nt|athene: but 2nt is a scramble for most people here, surely|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: well, East seems to think West has something at least|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In the women's final, Turkey are walking all over the mighty Dutch ladies. 51 IMPs up! And in the seniors, Grenthe (France) is 50 ahead against Pharon (England/Sweden)|pg||
nt|dburn: and I suppose on this occasion West has enough|pg||
nt|athene: @CK, @SA, @DK onside and trumps 3-2 - you don't need the trumps 3-2 though do you? singleton honour would be ok as well?|pg||
nt|brolucius: It doesn't seem a very good auction. A re-opening double sometimes assumes that partner will have some values (because the opponents have stopped low). When partner has those ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: expected values, he should not go on bidding until the cows come home.|pg||
nt|fokal: they had a misunderstanding about the 3 @h bid|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, it was not clear, after the double.|pg||
nt|fokal: for E it showed power, I think|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|pelu: 2@H overcall (alomst) OK - but why did East bid on in CR? - and here??|pg||

nt|jbgood: difficult to find the @h lead|pg||

nt|pelu: ok 8 toptricks - better played by S (@hJ in dummy) - if u need u can finess in @c|pg||
nt|jbgood: not that it would have mattered much|pg||

pc|h5|nt|alok_daga: prediction proved wrong,4clubs=+6 IMPS|pg||

nt|fokal: no, even if you are rooting for someone, you can still be fairplay|pg||
nt|brolucius: The 1100 comparison has been added to the score, so that makes it a more healthy lead.|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: put it down neatly?|pg||

nt|brolucius: Only necessary if partner would not raise with three trumps.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Then you have to guess.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Surely too dangerous for North to bid at IMPs.|pg||
nt|fokal: low honnors are good for NT, but here I though he would have found it easier to make @s tricks in a @s contract than in a NT contract|pg||
nt|athene: well, i don't think events so far have shown any of the players to be quivering cowards|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: so pass isn't guaranteed|pg||
pc|c5|nt|brolucius: No-one has ever accused me of being quivering.|pg||
nt|athene: if his clubs had been weaker i think he would have been more inclined to chance 2@D|pg||
nt|athene: the point being he expects a club lead against 1nt|pg||
nt|fokal: he knows he has a good scoresheets, and he knows as well that he has been toying with our "beloved and repected father"  's nerves|pg||

nt|brolucius: I was about to say the same.|pg||
nt|brolucius: As long as they are in the next set.|pg||

nt|jbgood: 44 imps turned over after 4 boards:) (and 5)|pg||
mb|1H|nt|fokal: 10 tricks doesn't seem possible|pg||
nt|jbgood: Peter - it looks like we are to see another combinded century this half too...|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: combined:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphpl8: maybe|pg||
mb|2H|an|.|nt|vugraphpl8: http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/or32runda1.html|pg||
mb|p|nt|fokal: don't|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: if decl play @D10 out of hand only down 1|pg||
nt|pelu: N is endplayed|pg||
nt|pelu: fore sure 11 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|glen: operators trained to entry two bids at a time, here W passed quickly, N thought|pg||
nt|galadriel: These high level decisions are so difficult - and can be soo costly|pg||
nt|vugraphpl8: http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/or321t7-2.htm|pg||
nt|jfaria:  we all know that :(|pg||
nt|ritong: a super rare auction|pg||
nt|pelu: 9 boards - 82 IMPs - I hope that there are no children here - too much blood :)|pg||
nt|barnets: and this will make|pg||
nt|vugraphpl8: w said that s passed because he wanted to go to bathroom|pg||
nt|barnets: nice pass|pg||
nt|vugraphpl8: * s went to bathroom|pg||
pc|h3|nt|barnets: south will put down 6 trump tricks|pg||
nt|barnets: in dummy|pg||
nt|ritong: if rod guesses right|pg||
nt|jbgood: did 2@h show spades & diamonds? or could he have a club side?|pg||
nt|pelu: kibs tells me: "parental control" on this match :)|pg||
nt|barnets: only lead to give dec a guess|pg||
nt|ritong: oui|pg||
nt|barnets: which trump to play|pg||
pc|hA|nt|glen: the @H lead sets up 4@S, 2@H and 1@D|pg||
nt|psyck: those who open 1@c with 44 in minors have an outside chance to get to 2@c here|pg||
nt|glen: before declarer can set up his 7 tricks|pg||
nt|fokal: ok corrected|pg||
nt|vugraphpl8: bad claim|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jfaria:  more imps coming 4 NS|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|galadriel: Even the experts get them wrong sometimes, which is a great comfort to allof us :)|pg||
nt|vugraphpl8: sry|pg||
pc|s2|nt|pelu: ok last board - tx to my fellow commentators - an to a group of very active kibs :), and spec tx to the polish IT-operators who are doing an outstanding job - and finaly to out ...|pg||
nt|pelu: ecelent operator at the table|pg||
pc|s5|nt|glen: the problem for N is that he did not show a great 14 high card point hand with 2NT|pg||
nt|pelu: np - u are doing fine|pg||
pc|sA|nt|brotherp: difficult to beat|pg||
nt|brotherp: how about the !J lead (ducked) :>|pg||
nt|brotherp: @S-J that is|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|brotherp: d! suit nicely divided for declarer|pg||
nt|brotherp: @d-suit|pg||
pc|s3|nt|fokal: yes, thx|pg||
nt|fokal: N has to play @cs till he still have the @d stopper|pg||
nt|athene: it might look obvious to us to set up the clubs with a diamond entry|pg||
nt|bigtrain: but he has to play a small @C now|pg||
nt|athene: but rodwell may be worried that declarer has @CJ9xxx|pg||
nt|fokal: and I'd say that for his point of view, it's quite clear|pg||
nt|bigtrain: to keep an entry|pg||
nt|fokal: I'm guessing he is hesitating betwenn K of @c and small @c|pg||
nt|bigtrain: that is if declarer can devine the @HQ is doubleton|pg||
nt|fokal: true athene|pg||
nt|fokal: though I don't know meckwell way of signaling|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 10 is attitude here|pg||
nt|bigtrain: rev attitude that is|pg||
nt|fokal: so it can be from 10x|pg||
nt|bigtrain: y|pg||
nt|fokal: it usually is from 10x actually|pg||
nt|pelu: then better lead @CK (for count)|pg||
nt|fokal: hum|pg||
nt|athene: @C10 is consistent with @C10x so not at all obvious to rodwell that he can set up the clubs|pg||
nt|fokal: are you sure the 10 doesn't show the 9 on the Q lead ?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|fokal: (which can be from QJ ?)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|brotherp: so 8 tricks will be there now..lets see if pepsi can work some magic|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|dT|nt|glen: those who open 1@C and are not playing 2+ etc,|pg||
nt|psyck: right, which is why i said outside chance only|pg||
nt|glen: now it looks like NS will cash out, since playing @Cs would not be right|pg||
nt|glen: however sometimes the defense thinks 1NT always has 2-3@S for 1NT|pg||
nt|pelu: I am told that by NS Q ask for count, and K for suit preference|pg||
pc|d5|nt|pelu: easy 8 trick - 2 @S ruff and just wait (need to take @HK also|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|pg||
pc|sT|nt|vugraphpl8: http://www.poznan2011.pl/|pg||
nt|pelu: disc @DK|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ritong: we all see that declarer has potentially 6 trumps and two aces   however, if east has underled @h J, there is a choice to make, on the lead and perhaps later|pg||
pc|h7|nt|vugraphpl8: bye|pg||
nt|pelu: but after a free bid by Jansma he could try once more|pg||
nt|glen: Balicki, with N hand for Monaco/Poland, overcalled 1@H and later bid @Ds|pg||
nt|fokal: ok now declarer can make it if he set us @s and guess the q of @h|pg||
nt|ritong: @hJ10|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|d2|nt|galadriel: Well I have alot of sympathy with David Bakshi ( South in other room) for upgrading this hand|pg||
nt|glen: running scores: http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/or16runda1.html|pg||
nt|fokal: ok to late for setting up the @s :)|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|bigtrain: absolutely because the Q shows either QJx (less than 4) or KQx(x) or AQJ(x) or AKQx(x)|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|brotherp: we can all see that it's easy now: just play north for the @s-king|pg||
nt|brotherp: but pepsi might be inclined to place @S-king in the south-hand|pg||
nt|jfaria:  and play 4 athrow in?|pg||
nt|brotherp: and then there are some funny throw-in squeeze kind of positions|pg||
nt|brotherp: yup|pg||
nt|jfaria:  lets see|pg||
pc|c4|nt|pelu: if J10 of Qhs in East S cant make, så prob he will play for aytual layout|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|brotherp: and he even might look at the @s 2 as a funny discard|pg||
nt|brotherp: i see; that's more logical (@h 8 discard)|pg||
nt|brotherp: askgaard guessing for @c J9 or @S q now|pg||
nt|dburn: weird sort of position, this|pg||
nt|jfaria:  if N plays a @s Pepesi must put the king|pg||
nt|dburn: even @cJ9 won't help him|pg||
nt|brotherp: and he can see @H 8 discard was more or less forced and not lavinthalish|pg||
nt|brotherp: depends on where pepsi places the @S K|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|brotherp: but would north not play a spade if he didnt hold the king....|pg||
nt|ritong: well, if i decide that east has @h J0, i play the 9 on the lead and claim|pg||
pc|cA|nt|bigtrain: with QJxx he would lead the J|pg||
nt|fokal: oh ok|pg||
nt|bigtrain: not true... Q gets attitude|pg||
pc|c3|nt|pelu: I would need notes at the table :)|pg||
pc|c9|nt|pelu: or can he?|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|c7|nt|glen: we don't have the beer garden scores in yet|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cT|nt|jfaria:  I mean, if N plays a @s he must have the king for Pepsi win|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|galadriel: (Ithink) he showed 18-19|pg||
nt|jfaria:  so u must play him for holding the K|pg||
pc|s7|pc|h4|nt|brotherp: y.. but then if he doesnt play a spade it does suggest the king|pg||
nt|brotherp: windows behind windows|pg||
nt|jfaria:  my point :)|pg||
nt|jfaria:  lol|pg||
nt|dburn: how will declarer make the contract, if South has the king of spades?|pg||
nt|brotherp: really nice poker hand -- the 'same-ness' between poker and bridge cant be stressed enough|pg||
nt|brotherp: cross with the club and play the heart|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed - but if that would work. North would have played a spade, not a club|pg||
nt|brotherp: we discussed that.. but north might be holding uncomfortable holdings like Jxxxx|pg||
nt|brotherp: so he wouldnt 'always' play a spade without the king|pg||
nt|brotherp: they might all feel like this will be the match-clincher|pg||
nt|brotherp: 5 more boards to go in a tight match|pg||
pc|h9|nt|brotherp: mmm|pg||
nt|brotherp: now S!A seems obvious|pg||
nt|brotherp: @sa|pg||
nt|dburn: not much more obvious than it seemed before - why should South not have started with three spades and three clubs?|pg||
nt|brotherp: catering for the squeeze i mean (if south holds this distribution with @sK)|pg||
nt|brotherp: pepsi might be playing north for the club length however and still go for the throw-in squeeze|pg||
nt|brotherp: if south has 3-3 blacks he can play SA and duck a spade (they only have 1@H to cash)|pg||
nt|brotherp: but obvious was really to rash|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
mc|9|nt|ritong: now that he s got a third side trick, all this becoomes academic|pg||

mb|1H|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|athene: i guess 3@H pushes EW into 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|fokal: a bit strong, I was about to say|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: was that really 1@H? 3@S suggests it was 3@H|pg||
nt|fokal: true|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h4|nt|Walddk2: Must be 3@H|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hT|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hJ|pc|h5|pc|hK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You sure Joanna?|pg||
nt|brolucius: I was about to applud 3@H, instead of a feeble 2@H, but had to cancel the comment when they showed 1@H.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It makes little sense that the player with a pre-empt opens at the 1 level, and the player with an opener pre-empts|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Please explain|pg||
nt|dburn: I expect North opened 3@h|pg||
nt|athene: a typical defensive problem for north here - return a club or a heart?|pg||
nt|dburn: but the bidding cards have been back in the box for some time|pg||
nt|fokal: a @h seems too radical|pg||
nt|athene: give partner @SK10x and nothing else, or @SQx and @CA, and the heart is necessary?|pg||
nt|fokal: yes|pg||
nt|athene: or @SAJ and out...etc|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Our excellent operator could have seen 3@H as 1@H. Sometimes the bidding cards are half hidden when playing with screens|pg||
pc|c5|nt|Walddk2: so she is excused if that is the case|pg||
nt|athene: of course the problem is as soon as you start trying to imagine hands for partner to justify a particular line of defence, you can always come up with some|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|pc|c2|pg||
nt|fokal: of course she is excused :)|pg||
pc|c6|nt|athene: but that doesn't mean it's the percentage action|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|vugraphpl5: you right|pg||
nt|vugraphpl5: sorry for mistake|pg||
nt|dburn: so will Thomas be, if he really played @cQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No worries mate as the Aussies would say|pg||
nt|brolucius: The operators have been excellent in this (very long) event. How they manage it hour after hour is amazing. An exhausting task.|pg||
nt|fokal: on board 25 they reached a game we didn't expect|pg||
nt|fokal: we though about 3nt and 5 @d but they played and made 4 @h|pg||
nt|athene: on 24 you mean?|pg||
nt|dburn: I doubt we thought about 5@d - that was a 3-3 fit|pg||
nt|brolucius: 24.|pg||

nt|jfaria:  my sympathy goes with yours Anne|pg||

nt|vugraphpl8: td|pg||
nt|vugraphpl8: 2H should be transfer on spades and this is a problem|pg||
mb|p|nt|jfaria:  there seems to be a problem with Lev's system. Operator can tell exactly what it is|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: we hit those light openings so hard they were intimidated to open :)|pg||
nt|psyck: Michal, pls correct to 1NE-1|pg||
nt|glen: its tough when the almost seniors bid more than the young ones|pg||
mb|3H|mb|3S|nt|glen: now there's a young 1@S opening|pg||

mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|vugraphpl8: I told that Lev forgot that 2H was transfer on spades|pg||

pc|h5|pc|h4|pc|hQ|pc|hT|pg||

nt|jfaria:  so it looks that the result of board 24 is in dispute|pg||
nt|vugraphpl8: yes |pg||
pc|hA|nt|fabsayc: the ninth trick on the lead|pg||
nt|psyck: well, the 3rd seat opening may have kept them out of slam, not sure if they'd get higher uncontested though|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|jfaria:  nothing special on this one, G/T runnig out of hope|pg||
nt|glen: anybody for 6@H?|pg||
nt|psyck: W may have needed to open for EW to bid slam|pg||
nt|glen: some specs vote for 7@H on the layout|pg||
nt|jbgood: 2 @s would have been easy - 3 a bit more challenging, but ...|pg||
pc|h7|nt|jfaria:  that will add some drama to final boards|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|jbgood: i think the spade lead ducked was a defensive winner|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cA|nt|alok_daga: how gud can this nt be?QJ tight in 1 suit,1 suit barren.agreed 1cl 1sp response presents problems but 1nt?|pg||
nt|athene: in theory declarer has four spades, four diamonds and the @HA but he can never untangle all four diamonds|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|pg||
nt|bigtrain: hard to see how he will make this|pg||
nt|athene: surely that was ace and another trump|pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: small trump gives declarer TWO tricks - he can play three rounds of diamonds then ruff a heart and play the thirteenth diamond :)|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|nt|rado: will will make 10 since W cannot lead 2nd @H now|pg||
nt|alok_daga: the steamroller at work,22 IMPS lead|pg||

mb|4C|mb|p|nt|brolucius: His high cards are pulling full weight.|pg||

mb|p|pc|d2|nt|brolucius: West could not have done any more.|pg||

pc|cK|pc|c6|pc|c3|pg||
pc|d9|nt|dburn: but what he did was completely normal - in the play, at any rate; I'm still not sure about 4@c|pg||
pc|c9|pc|h5|pc|d3|pg||
nt|dburn: but if South had five cards in either minor, it was right for North to be competing|pg||
nt|athene: yes north was imagining 1-3-(54) with south i suppose|pg||
nt|athene: but surely with that shape south would have bid more than 2@D over the double|pg||
nt|brolucius: Unusual for North to bid so high with extra points and only 4-4 shape.|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe he would, but he was raising a potentially three-card diamond suit|pg||
nt|dburn: so no guarantee that he would bid 3@d with, say, 1=4=3=5|pg||
nt|brolucius: Nor 2@D.|pg||
nt|athene: ok, but why not bid 3@C rather than 3@D, then?|pg||
nt|fokal: 2 @d shows 4 card sometimes 5 never 3|pg||
nt|athene: lets you find some magic club fit without unilateral 4-level adventures|pg||

nt|alok_daga: assume 3hrts,3nt meant some sort of shortage|pg||
nt|jfaria:  tuff, only 2 boards left |pg||
nt|galadriel: For running scores http://www.poznan2011.pl/|pg||
nt|ritong: this contract looks cosy|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|nt|glen: N nicely goes with a safe lead|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, major suit lead would have saved time for us though|pg||
nt|psyck: They stayed out of slam last deal other room too|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c4|pg||
nt|psyck: so it still remains a relatively low scoring affair with no double digit swings|pg||
nt|jfaria:  3nt in open this may get too close|pg||
pc|cK|nt|glen: rodwell also opening 1@S to keep it young|pg||
nt|athene: 7@C is a big bid with no trick source|pg||
nt|jbgood: a tall order|pg||
nt|bigtrain: needs trumps 2-2 if trump lead|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes even a nine-card trump fit isn't enough, if that is all you have|pg||
pc|c6|nt|jbgood: and everything falls into place|pg||
nt|athene: lots of specs are saying he does have some spades|pg||
nt|athene: yes, but he knows his partner has a spade void|pg||
nt|fokal: he can win by ruffing 3 @s|pg||
nt|athene: so it will take a fair bit of work to get the spades set up|pg||
nt|bigtrain: but needs trump do to the fact he has only 1 entry|pg||
nt|athene: 4-3 spades and 2-2 trumps means everything is happy of course|pg||
nt|athene: but it's not exactly a laydown grand|pg||
nt|fokal: but it seems he need @cs 2-2|pg||
nt|pelu: some strange results on result page: Board 2 (open) 5@D - 1 on BBO scored as +600, Board 6 bridgemate: only 2Nt +1 not 3Nt making (here i this room)|pg||
nt|bigtrain: could play for both @S onside if he doesn't think trump splits|pg||
nt|athene: there are various options in spades like @SHx with north (ruff one then ruffing finesse)|pg||
nt|athene: or just the double ruffing finesse against south, yes|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i'm offerring an alternative line|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Yesterday, Zia ventured 'Zia's Rule': "Don't lead a trump against a grand slam", he said|pg||
nt|bigtrain: it diesn't work buthe may choose it since the other option is trump 22 and @S 43|pg||
nt|vugraphpl8: http://www.poznan2011.pl/|pg||
nt|athene: :) well the rule "ALWAYS lead a trump against a grand slam" is definitely a bad one|pg||
nt|bigtrain: or KQx in @S|pg||
nt|athene: but maybe zia has gone too far the other way|pg||
nt|pelu: the rule is: dont lead trump if pd has QJ :)|pg||
nt|jbgood: we can all see everything is nice, but the lead surely looks like a singleton...|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c8|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ritong: 9 on top now|pg||
nt|ritong: 3 trumps 4@ds 1@h 1@s|pg||

pc|h2|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|vugraphpl8: http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/or321t7-2.htm|pg||
nt|galadriel: I think the Bulgarians are a young team- some have played for the national open team and some for National Juniors|pg||
nt|galadriel: Maybe a spec can tell me if I'm wrong|pg||
nt|pelu: a 2. @H trick will make the contract|pg||
nt|ritong: perhaps a @d lead would have reduced this to 8|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h7|pc|h4|pg||
nt|galadriel: Ah, ok this is a Junior pair|pg||
nt|jbgood: may even get 10 now - hearts friendly|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
pc|sK|nt|psyck: he doesn't want to run @d's before testing @s as no convenient discards|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s7|nt|pelu: 2 x yesterday in slams decl missing QJxx, trumps were 2-2 and both times fines for down 1|pg||
pc|sA|pg||

pc|c4|pc|c3|pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1D|an|.|nt|athene: will meckstroth double 4@S?|pg||
nt|athene: i think for most people if you bid 4@H then double 4@S it just says you have a good hand for 4@H; not especially with spades|pg||
nt|jbgood: right Henri - was cold from the start|pg||
nt|barnets: run of 27 imps now n/s|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphpl8: :)|pg||

nt|vugraphpl8: http://www.poznan2011.pl/|pg||
nt|athene: ok wow - i was expecting double from west|pg||
nt|jbgood: so was I|pg||
mb|1N|nt|galadriel: Only South is Junior National|pg||
nt|jfaria:  wc b|pg||
mb|p|nt|glen: 4@S here doesn't work since @Hs play for two losers, and @Ds need for @C discards or there is a @C loser|pg||
nt|thenapster: and 3nt from south in heart lead also some problems|pg||
nt|brotherp: still a match it seems|pg||
mb|p|nt|glen: not sure what 2@C shows, if it did not show @Ds, might get a @D lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|jfaria:  what is 3@s |pg||
nt|jfaria:  another lsot game|pg||
nt|athene: well he can surely double this :)|pg||
nt|ritong: anyways, as walter underlined, every trip trip starts with one step|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|fabsayc: 2@D asks size and spade length by steps|pg||
nt|pelu: kibs tells that they watched 5@d making, so "just" wrong in bridgemate - and we prob have the correct score here on BBO :)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|brotherp: what happened to the td-board where lev made a bidding error?|pg||
pc|h6|nt|fokal: too bad , 4S may have won|pg||
nt|athene: a bit unlucky for EW perhaps; sometimes 5@C will work out much the best|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|glen: 2@C may be a game force relay bid|pg||
nt|psyck: i thought they play 1N as gf relay :)|pg||
nt|jbgood: i hope you kibs appreciate that i cannot answer all private chats... just too many|pg||
nt|pelu: so 8 IMP - the average is only 7,46|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|nt|glen: that was over 1@H|pg||
nt|psyck: but maybe that is only on 1@h open|pg||
nt|glen: to allow for 2@HXX|pg||
nt|jfaria:  still moe if board 24 results in some kind of penalty|pg||
nt|athene: still they can't really complain about their luck too much after the previous board|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hK|pg||
nt|psyck: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphpl8: running scores - http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/or16runda1.html|pg||
nt|glen: the @D queen is played to hide the location of the @D jack from W|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ritong: looks like a supplementary favorable board for the trailers|pg||
nt|jbgood: 98 imps changing hand so far this segment - and more here|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|jfaria:  in open they r playing 4@d wich can make|pg||
nt|brotherp: 4D seems difficult; while 3@s seems 1 off at least|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c4|pg||
nt|psyck: so 2@c gf here & 2N further enquiry maybe|pg||
nt|ritong: good move by joe piekarek|pg||
nt|jbgood: of course 2@d in the OR was not what the audience would have landed in:)|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hT|pc|hA|pc|d4|pg||
nt|glen: now E can win this, play a @D, and get a @H through dummy|pg||
pc|c2|nt|thenapster: now e-w can attack the clubs|pg||
nt|glen: which has 1@S, 2@H, 1@D and 1@C|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jfaria:  4@d making in open|pg||

nt|vugraphpl8: running scores -http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/ofrunda1.html|pg||

nt|dburn: so opening at IMPs is the antithesis of matchpoint bidding|pg||
mb|1N|nt|brolucius: One way of describing it.|pg||
nt|fokal: another distributionnal hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|athene: well it's good to see NO flat boards so far this segment (and no likelihood of any in the near future)|pg||
nt|fokal: they play 2 @s as natural non forcing ??|pg||
nt|dburn: unusual these days to see a natural takeout facing a strong no trump|pg||
nt|brolucius: The cards lie well for a club contract.|pg||
nt|athene: i think west bid 2@H and north bid 2@S|pg||
nt|dburn: that could easily be|pg||
mb|3H|nt|athene: if you play double of the transfer as t/o of the suit, then the cue can be michaels|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|fokal: yeah, seemed more like it :)|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|athene: you can make 6@C here, can't you? what with things breaking nicely|pg||
nt|fokal: he was planning to bid @c even at the 5 level from the start|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|fokal: other wise he would have bid 2 @s I think|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: or of course you can make 4@C+2|pg||
nt|brolucius: Difficult decision for South, although we can all see the favourable breaks.|pg||
nt|athene: how about 4@C leaping michaels over 2@H?|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d5|pc|c3|pg||
nt|athene: it's surprising how many situations lend themselves to leaping michaels :)|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h7|pc|hT|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h8|nt|brolucius: Usually a singleton in partner's main suit is no asset (unless you have 5-card support).|pg||
pc|c2|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|fokal: :) don't think they've discussed about this|pg||
nt|dburn: it's surprising how many situations lead themselves to support doubles also, but this does not mean you should play either convention|pg||
nt|athene: good case for it after e.g. (1@S) pass (2@S) 4@C and so on|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|brolucius: Michaels not so wonderful with a 6-card major, since that will often make the better trump suit (difficult for partner to judge).|pg||

mb|p|nt|bigtrain: big @C, little @D|pg||
mb|4H|nt|galadriel: Many thanks to Michal our VG operator - great job!|pg||

nt|thenapster: so only diamond lead have to duck like you said|pg||
nt|pelu: they are in 5@C now|pg||
nt|ritong: over opponent's transfer, bidding their suit can have two meanings, to be decided with your regular pard  either two suiter or general take/out|pg||
nt|dburn: or even 4@h - I guess that will make|pg||
nt|ritong: hello david|pg||
nt|pelu: but even 4@h make|pg||
nt|barnets: north gives south choice of games|pg||
mb|p|nt|glen: @D duck is hard on a layout where N might have singleton @D and 1-2@Cs|pg||
nt|brotherp: good lead|pg||
nt|brotherp: and easy 2 off|pg||
nt|brotherp: seems to clinch victory for the mahaffey-guys|pg||

nt|jbgood: and game bid narrows the gap further|pg||
pc|dA|nt|jfaria:  yeap, regardless of result concerning b 24|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@C = 6-7 <4@S|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@S for me is @H + minor, but Meck is not sure|pg||
pc|d3|nt|bigtrain: 2@S scrambling|pg||
nt|athene: doesn't 2@C deny even 3 spades?|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@D that is|pg||
nt|athene: i thought they bid 2@D with 5-7 and 3 spades|pg||
nt|bigtrain: yes...  mistyped|pg||
nt|fokal: might be funny if in the other West does what some kib said , doubling 4 @h, and the auction ends up in 4 @hX|pg||
pc|d9|nt|glen: unless the @D 9 holds|pg||
nt|thenapster: yes|pg||
nt|glen: and the polish @D 3 lead is best|pg||

nt|bigtrain: <3...  still dark here :)|pg||
pc|h2|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Large margins in the other two finals. Women: Turkey + 27 vs the Netherlands, and seniors Grenthe (France) +32 against Pharon (England/Sweden)|pg||
nt|barnets: 5@C is better|pg||
nt|dburn: I expect he is sure - he is just not sure which game will play better|pg||
nt|pelu: a very lucky misunderstanding - strange NS has been partners for many years|pg||
nt|barnets: as it makes with hearts 4-2 and clubs 2-2|pg||
nt|jbgood: since thay cannot attack diamonds repeatedly, the 3-3 split in trumps and 2-2 clubs makes this "easy"|pg||
nt|ritong: are you sure it is a missund, peter?|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|ritong: what about a possible 6/2|pg||
nt|pelu: if @Hs 4-2 u would all say: bad bidding:|pg||
mb|2N|an|.|nt|pelu: S can see that its not a 6-2|pg||
nt|fokal: it was in deed bad bidding, but lucky|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|barnets: 6@S a good contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: if nor a misunderstandingm then just bad bidding - what do u prefer?|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|bigtrain: 1@S = 5+@S|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@S shows exactly a 3fit|pg||
mb|3N|nt|athene: 2nt takeout, typically 6@H 4minor i guess|pg||
nt|ritong: neither|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: with 5-5 he would just bid his minor|pg||
nt|fokal: need pretty much @d K onside|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S=14-16 HCP, some void|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|ritong: i prefer they stop the bleeding:)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|barnets: or@CA lead|pg||
nt|bobholl: east won't like this|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: club ruff to beat 3@S, but even if east doesn't go for that, there is still a guess|pg||
mb|p|pc|d7|nt|bigtrain: i think 3@H was going down though|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: was it?|pg||
nt|jbgood: yes - on a di lead the big heart in S would give 1 down|pg||
nt|athene: you can lead a trump from dummy and then afford to ruff high|pg||
nt|bigtrain: even without that there isn't enuf communication to do everything|pg||
nt|athene: ah sorry no of course|pg||
nt|vugraphpl8: http://b.poznan2011.pl/ot/of1t1-1.htm|pg||
nt|bigtrain: with only 1 entry you can't lead towards both red suits|pg||
nt|jbgood: even if E goes for a club ruff he will be endplayed |pg||

pc|c2|pc|h5|pc|d3|pg||
pc|d4|nt|fokal: endplayed ? without cashing the last trump ?|pg||
pc|c6|pc|s4|pc|dT|pg||
nt|pelu: look at the bidding in OR : 1@S - 3@D - 6@S - and no comments from me :)|pg||

nt|brolucius: That was a board to remind us that a match is not over until the 'fat lady sings'.|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|2H!|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dA|nt|athene: 2@H is 5@S4@H less than invite?|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2@H no doubt weak with both majors.|pg||
nt|athene: 5@S4+@H that is|pg||

pc|d7|pc|dK|nt|fokal: on trump lead you do the @d finesse play back a trump to dummy, another finesse then As of @d D ruff and K of @c to discard a @h. You should make it indeed. (even with @s 3-1 , you ...|pg||
nt|fokal: just don't play the As of @d)|pg||

nt|ritong: barnet, you crow!!|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jbgood: even though Smirnow means somehting like "with peace" or the like:)|pg||
nt|barnets: that put the kiss of death on them|pg||
pc|c3|nt|jbgood: *--ov|pg||
nt|brolucius: It was hardly East's fault that the slam was missed, so why was West angry?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: their 2@H and 2@S responses are very close   but 2@H can include hands with longer @S|pg||
pc|cT|nt|jbgood: we are way ahead of the OR - last one of this segment now|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i'm a bit surprised taht roddy didn't bid at this colour|pg||

nt|jbgood: in 25 mins|pg||

nt|pelu: W is a angry young man :) and easy to blame partner :)|pg||
nt|vugraphpl8: he doesn't blame partner|pg||
pc|dA|pc|s4|nt|pelu: prob W feel that East is too strong to bid only 3@D|pg||
pc|d6|nt|fokal: do they play, sr |pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s2|pc|sA|pc|sQ|pg||

nt|fokal: here|pg||
nt|pelu: D normal = 5 card+ suit|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cQ|pc|c6|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s8|nt|fokal: maybe rodwell could have done something, wwhite against red|pg||
pc|d4|nt|jbgood: looked as if the @d 10 should be given the trick  - for an overtrick...|pg||
nt|pelu: ok Hi all and tx to our fine operator Michal - and to kibs with a lot of comments |pg||
nt|jbgood: bye for now|pg||
