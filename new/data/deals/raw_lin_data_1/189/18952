nt|blum1956: 14-30 with me|pg||
nt|vugraphpl3: welcome all and enjoy. @H :)|pg||
nt|blum1956: Probably Rusev should believe North and look for partner's minor suit|pg||
nt|blum1956: 2@h being a 2-suiter|pg||
mb|5H|nt|glen: W played with Trendafilov in the 2009 Bermuda Bowl, so Rusev is a new trend|pg||

nt|blum1956: East will be disappointed by the result|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hJ|pc|h2|pg||

nt|glen: and a big swing here|pg||
pc|c2|nt|bjacobs: Hard to blame East - he found the winning decision not to double 4@S|pg||
pc|cT|pc|sT|nt|blum1956: yes|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|pc|s5|nt|bjacobs: I think Bakhshi's decision was just too good|pg||
nt|benjy:  would you guys all bid with the south hand?|pg||
mc|11|nt|bjacobs: doubt it|pg||
nt|blum1956: I would not|pg||
nt|glen: i would not, so I would not be +850|pg||

nt|jfaria:  a very close match, 1 imp diference|pg||
nt|galadriel: Hello everyone|pg||
mb|5D|nt|tsadek: west need fit +K@C then he ask for aces|pg||
nt|pelu: here I prefer "Nt as transfer to @D (and 2@S for @C)|pg||
mb|p|nt|glen: expect 2NT to be @D transfer, and 3@C = likes @Ds|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: so 3@H = singleton|pg||
nt|pelu: diff when u have 2 singletons :)|pg||
nt|rado: hi all:)|pg||
nt|rado: @D lead and @S underlead Ak will beat it but unlikely|pg||
mb|p|nt|jfaria:  just in time for an exciting board :)|pg||
nt|galadriel: Well, 5@S will make|pg||
nt|jfaria:  who could bid it?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|galadriel: Do you think North should bid one more? Or is he worried to push them into makingslam?|pg||

nt|galadriel: From is point of view, 6 of minor could be on|pg||
pc|d4|nt|galadriel: his|pg||
nt|jfaria:  think the light opening by W succeeded|pg||
pc|d5|nt|glen: what was that about fines for slow play, how about fines for slow bidding?|pg||
nt|tsadek: I like Verhees bid of 3@S in closed room , Force his pd to bid 4@C with K@C|pg||
nt|pelu: not easy when two players from so dif nations and diff style play together|pg||
pc|dK|pc|s2|pg||
pc|d6|nt|pelu: 5@H ask for @DQ - better 5Nt ask for @C-cue|pg||
pc|s4|pc|dA|pc|d8|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d6|nt|bjacobs: In a way, it would have been better for East to "misjudge" and double 4@S for penalty, if partner will rip it|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Then N/S would find it much tougher to compete to 5@S|pg||
pc|d4|nt|glen: the only twist to that natural auction was N rebid 1NT, not 1@S with a 4-3-3-3|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d5|pg||
nt|blum1956: 26 points but a poor contract|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Good start by Townsend, killing the diamond suit|pg||
nt|blum1956: anyway easily making when knowing all 4 hands|pg||
nt|benjy:  any ideas on the correct line?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: wait for West to make a play first|pg||
nt|benjy:  win the diamond return and take a spade hook?|pg||
pc|d7|nt|blum1956: the hand is selfplaying probably|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d2|pc|dA|pg||
nt|glen: one approach is to lead towards the black QJx's|pg||
nt|bjacobs: In isolation, that is surely the right way to play QJx opposite Axxxx|pg||
nt|benjy:  Declarer may suspect the @D suit is 6-2 from the hesitation to continue|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|pc|sA|nt|benjy:  if @D are 5-3 then leading towards both QJx will surely lead to deafeat|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|bjacobs: that's why I suggested "in isolation"|pg||
nt|blum1956: he better had ducked the @sK|pg||
nt|glen: yes, i'm surprised how fast he took it|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|pc|hQ|pc|h5|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, he didn't want to lose a trick and allow the third diamond to be played|pg||
nt|bjacobs: pretty complicated hand|pg||
nt|benjy:  if he ducks a @H now then i don't think he can go down|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think he'll more likely return to a black suit play|pg||
pc|h6|nt|blum1956: he still is not sure diamonds are 6-2|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|bjacobs: Karanaivanov trying to temp declarer into a cover ... nice play|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
nt|blum1956: very clever play|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sJ|pc|s7|pc|s4|pg||
nt|blum1956: now there is only 8 tricks|pg||
nt|bjacobs: well, Townsend played it well, but West's play was just too good.  We've seen a couple of brilliant efforts in the first two hands|pg||
nt|blum1956: perfect defense by the Bulgarians|pg||

nt|jfaria:  obviously N was afraid of doing something weird|pg||
nt|galadriel: These high level decisions are so difficult|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|nt|rado: again some action with all hands non-balanced|pg||
nt|rado: N may bid @C 1st hoping to introduce @S later by DBL , or direct start with DBL|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|vugraphpl8: http://www.poznan2011.pl/|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|alok_daga: Hi all|pg||
nt|galadriel: They will get to 3NT here|pg||
nt|galadriel: which is a tricky contract|pg||
nt|galadriel: plenty of HCP but no real source of tricks|pg||
nt|jfaria:  y, trick power in every suit|pg||
nt|jfaria:  probably will get a favourable lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rado: hi|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cQ|pc|c4|nt|glen: some partnerships have given up game invites on the N type hands, just blast 4@S and hope the unknown nature of the hand can help|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|glen: here the 3@h and then 4@S indicates a stonger idea|pg||
nt|jfaria:  big swing first board|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s9|nt|glen: but hard for N to find the perfect cards in the S hand for slam|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|glen: greco-hampson (in another match) reached 3@S|pg||
nt|galadriel: They got X'd in 5@S in other room for 850|pg||
nt|jfaria:  double game swing outch!|pg||
nt|galadriel: Interestingly, it was South who competed to 5@S|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Both pairs play Precision. I think I can find EW's CC, one moment|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s5|pc|s6|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|glen: and their opps did likewise|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cK|pc|c6|pc|c3|pg||

mb|1H|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: you are being harsh ... the @HK play guaranteed 2 tricks in the suit if that jack was originally doubleton|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: it's still not clear to me why declarer was making if he had ducked the 2nd heart|pg||
nt|blum1956: 3 spades and 2 tricks in each other suit|pg||
nt|glen: what do you lead from E hand on this bidding?|pg||
nt|benjy:  Q@S|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c2|pc|c4|pc|cK|pg||
nt|glen: ah, i thought @C jack was an option|pg||
nt|bjacobs: right but back on the other hand, you still have to exit twice to West, who can set up 2 heart tricks and one of each|pg||

nt|galadriel: I thought it was 9 only|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|alok_daga: Qx,Qx,hardly an opening hand,M also 2 2|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Michal, you sure?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|pelu: here NL had 5½ bidding-round to find 4@S with 6@s almost cold|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Only 1 IMP in it, but that could be important with the scoreline this close|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Corrected now|pg||
nt|vugraphpl8: sry bad claim|pg||
nt|Walddk5: np|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|glen: in the other room EW made six bids without @S, but then accidently bid the suit to play there|pg||
nt|rado: we've seen many wild openings those days:)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|glen: the 4@S bid here will be enough to get to slam now|pg||
nt|glen: even though EW are just temporary italians, they will use roman keycard blackwood|pg||
nt|pelu: for sure ita not easy to find out that the hands fit so well|pg||
nt|glen: Q. what is 2NT, A. unknown to us, but likely forcing game try, that in this case is a slam try|pg||
pc|c5|nt|tsadek: 2NT want to know 2@S with 3card or 4card|pg||
nt|pelu: 2NT could be invit+|pg||
nt|tsadek: 4@S max 4card @S|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|alok_daga: True,Rado,the openings r getting wilder by the day|pg||
nt|galadriel: Thanks :)|pg||

pc|d2|nt|glen: wow|pg||
nt|pelu: if so, then 4@s stronger than 3@s|pg||
nt|glen: or in this case, reverse wow|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the funny thing is the light to wild openings don't seem to ever work, one wonders the attraction|pg||
nt|alok_daga: Query,wud u sell 2 a 2dmnds or xle from Easts hand?P marked with strength|pg||

pc|sT|nt|jfaria:  E and N bidding @h first meaning @s |pg||

pc|s9|nt|glen: the question of slam is where is the @D Q|pg||
nt|blum1956: East chose 1NT rather than 2NT, this decision preventing his side from bidding of the 6@c contract which fails as the diamond finesse does not work|pg||
