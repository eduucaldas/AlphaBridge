pc|sA|nt|patricck: Welcome everyone|pg||
nt|neobas: I must admit I have heard of the NS players but not the EW players|pg||

pc|d2|pc|d5|pc|dT|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|karesz: club back wasthe strongest, i think|pg||
nt|petergill: Nice duck by Zoller|pg||

pc|dK|pc|d3|pc|d4|pc|d7|pg||
nt|petergill: Was hard for South to place @HK - @H5 from West did not have to be low encourage |pg||
nt|psridhar: basically 1N all pass doesnt afford much info abt defenders hands as the 4 suit auction at other tbl did|pg||
nt|petergill: Declarer correctly ducks @DA to retain the major tenace in the suit, usually that is the best technique|pg||
nt|bjacobs: West would lover to be able to place both the @H8 and @D9|pg||
nt|psridhar: w iss considering a @c i thk|pg||
nt|karesz: j @C|pg||
nt|petergill: I think the play of @H10 (instead of a @d through) strongly suggests that East holds @H8|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, and even if declarer has it, the tricks are his by right anyway|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So I reckon a heart here is probably best|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|petergill: I think @CJ is extremely unlikely - what if declarer has AKx in clubs?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|bjacobs: But Zoller goes for creativity|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pg||
nt|karesz: Wow! Bill you ar right not tos ee your teammates!!! :):):(|pg||
nt|petergill: ???|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Best to live in ignorance :)|pg||
nt|petergill: Was it @SA not @SJ? Or was @SJ won by S?|pg||
nt|psridhar: @s jack created only one trick ( for decl) but the deuce created 3 for defndders|pg||
nt|karesz: yesssssssssss!|pg||

pc|c3|pc|cQ|pc|cK|pc|c8|pg||

nt|vugraphzyj: N signaled with the 9@s... and gave a trick away...|pg||
nt|sybarra: that hand may get some discussion .....|pg||
nt|rmb1: so we are in for an exciting day!|pg||
nt|roswolf: i have been doing bbo commentary for a long time and that was truly unbelievable|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|an|prec|nt|april7: here EW might go go overboard but perhaps they will stay in a good 3NT contract|pg||
nt|sybarra: in the recap |pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|april7: 6@C is a possible contrACT|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: 6@C is a lucky contract, but not 6@D|pg||
mb|1H|nt|roswolf: indeed think west should pass here|pg||
nt|neobas: I don't like the 3NT rebid tbh|pg||
nt|neobas: I usually play it as solid diamonds and a bit too much to open a Gambling 3NT|pg||
nt|april7: no W is thinking about a 6 @C contract and will have the luck to make it if he decides to do it|pg||
nt|neobas: Anyone for 3@D?|pg||
nt|roswolf: but 4@C may be ok provided they could stop in 4NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: 3@D is the more normal rebid...  I don't think 3NT is such an ugly choice tho|pg||
nt|rmb1: I can't find convention cards on line: I think this is a picture of East http://www.bridzs.hu/node/184/52|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is sane so far|pg||
mb|1S|nt|roswolf: AH AH|pg||
nt|neobas: "My @C are more solid than your @D"|pg||
nt|roswolf: now a major cue?|pg||
nt|neobas: :)|pg||
nt|april7: now 4 @D and then 6@C perhaps|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: 1nt?|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: Signaling Rule  2:  Never signal with a trick.|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: now e/w should get to 6@C|pg||
nt|sybarra: and   1 is?|pg||
nt|panja: 1@S pass might be the best spot...|pg||
nt|roswolf: we shall see|pg||
nt|panja: would have been difficult to make 7 tricks in 1Nt|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|rmb1: Another auction you do not see that often (with opener passing 1S)|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|nt|roswolf: must avoid 6NT|pg||
nt|patricck: 6@C can be beaten on a @H lead as long as when the Q@S is run on the first round of the suit South ducks|pg||
nt|april7: W should ofcourse pull trumps before giving up a @S|pg||
nt|roswolf: that would be tough i think|pg||
nt|april7: 6NT possible except on @H lead,but S will lead @H ofcourse|pg||
nt|patricck: sorry, stupid of me, diamonds don't need to be set up in clubs|pg||

pc|c8|pc|c5|pc|cQ|nt|april7: 3NT by E shouldn't be with a singleton @C from W's point of view ofcourse|pg||

nt|petergill: Sorry, i was wrong. Smith Echo is by Curtis Smith|pg||
nt|vugraphzvw: Board 1, there was a lead out of turn by Lakatos, that's why you only see the result|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Smith is a rare surname, so not that easy to find :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, that's the problem when you have a name like Smith?  All your inventions are likely to get plagiarized|pg||
nt|bjacobs: He should have called it the Curtis echo|pg||
nt|karesz: Psmith (p does not sound)|pg||

nt|psridhar: 2@h WAS weak |pg||
nt|vugraphzvw: what's the preoblem, we play weak two's, don't we? :)|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@H is active, but not vul opposite a passed hand, seems to have a lot going for it. |pg||
nt|bjacobs: South could try 4@H, but what could North do?|pg||
nt|petergill: From W's point of view, opponents must have game or slam on, so it's a good time to preempt them|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So it seems to me that South will have to bid it on his own, which doesn't seem easy|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|psridhar: South has to work out what Pd has for passing 2@H and then leaping to 3@s|pg||
nt|bjacobs: North vainly looking for something to cue?|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@S is just right, maybe a tad conservative, and should lead to 6@S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, @DQ must be worth gold, and the 5th spade|pg||
mb|4N|nt|psridhar: usually that shows @s length and not much HCP outside|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Excellent auction|pg||
pc|cA|nt|petergill: Someone had to bid 4NT, and if South wasn;t going to, then North had to bid 4NT- North could hardly have a better hand for his Pass of 2@H etc|pg||
