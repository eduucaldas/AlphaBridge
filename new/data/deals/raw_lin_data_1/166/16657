nt|roswolf: Hove is damp but otherwise back to the action|pg||
nt|roswolf: do we know the systems?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our operator is Hanna|pg||
nt|panja: hi Hanna|pg||
nt|rmb1: starting out at paved patios between victorian terraces - it would spin from the off |pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzvx: hi all|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w will reach 4@H here|pg||
nt|rmb1: With the @DA onside there should be no problem making 11|pg||
nt|roswolf: n/c play precision with a lot of relays i am reliably told|pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s|pg||
nt|xenya: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzvx: NS plays precision|pg||

nt|sybarra: or??|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello Cornelia,  welcome|pg||
mb|p|nt|neobas: Hey all, welcome to some Israeli junior bridge|pg||
nt|roswolf: the first board is not the place for a psychic adventure|pg||
nt|rmb1: With the first pass being alerted (now withdrawn) I thought we were in for an exciting day|pg||
nt|bobh1: cam|pg||
nt|sybarra2: hi all |pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Cam:) Normaly not to comment this segment. Next I'm signed up.|pg||
pc|hT|nt|rodal f: Sr. Privat|pg||
nt|karesz: hi shirley may i join to you?|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|nigel_k:  4@h will just be showing a good raise to 4@s so North doesn't have enough to bid further|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Which is just as well since 10 tricks are the limit|pg||
nt|shevek: *I would prefer 4@h by East|pg||
nt|daman: NS will probably end up in 3NT or 4@H|pg||
nt|lestergold: Morning George. Csaba and specs|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|peachy: website http://www.bridzs.hu/verseny/20102011_orszagos_csapatbajnoksag_elodontok_donto_bronzmeccs   but it is in Hungarian|pg||
nt|vugraphzvx: hi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzvx: i missed the first board|pg||
nt|vugraphzvx: sry|pg||
nt|chick: Hello Everyone :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West will not be disappointed with the @cQ in dummy  |pg||
nt|vugraphzvx: i will claim the result|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hi everyone from a rain sodden Manchester|pg||
nt|mdgraham: nothing new there, then|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it's an odd double |pg||
nt|peachy: Hello Kath|pg||
nt|yo_yo: lovely name :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: asks for a heart lead, I guess|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it didnt do a lot of good |pg||
nt|yo_yo: here's one pic : http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=14233|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it was a good idea, just in case partner took it into his head to lead something else |pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|rmb1: Less likely to make 11 in 4@S (so much for predictions)|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@S as a final contract?|pg||
nt|rmb1: This is the second 16-board stanza of 4 in the semi-final, finals tomorrow|pg||
nt|ady: good lay of the cards for 4@S|pg||
nt|daman: Hi Mike|pg||
nt|gambit: off-beat 1NT opening will work out OK |pg||
pc|dA|nt|patricck: Welcome everyone|pg||
nt|neobas: I must admit I have heard of the NS players but not the EW players|pg||
nt|patricck: I believe 1NT is the best bid on the North hand, tho I know it is't to everyone's taste|pg||
nt|april7: hello everybody and good afternoon|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the other semi-fianl wasa 33-33 after 16 boards |pg||
nt|nigel_k:  The problem is that 4@h could be far too much if partner has heart shortage|pg||
nt|shevek: 7-5 still....|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  But with some heart support or good diamonds opposite the East hand is huge|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and 5@h is only -1, if E can play @d the right way|pg||
nt|shevek: yes always 9 tricks in @h for EW, so even 5@h would be a good sacrifice|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d3|nt|Walddk4: http://www.israbridge.com/home/results/2011/jun11-f.pdf  for standings after round 8|pg||
nt|Walddk4: N-S leading by 10 miles|pg||
nt|Walddk4: E-W are young ladies|pg||
nt|neobas: I think it is fair to say the Israeli U21 and U26 teams have good chances of medals at every youth competition so we should see some good bridge here today|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|bobh1: not the best suit to attack, although he has induced declarer to misguess|pg||
pc|dT|nt|shevek: always 2 losers in @d, one club and 1 heart|pg||
pc|dK|nt|rmb1: No there was a swing on the last board 38-33 to GAMAX|pg||
nt|lestergold: only lead to give contract|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d6|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ah, sry|pg||
pc|h9|nt|nigel_k:  You might start with @dQ, or more likely a low diamond from dummy then guess right on the next round|pg||
nt|lestergold: so often the case|pg||
pc|h2|nt|roswolf: this was a real auction - sacre bleu!|pg||
pc|h8|nt|gambit: oh|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|bobh1: lol|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ralfwil: If E bids 4@h on the first round he can follow up with 5@d......|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  It would depend who you think has short @d|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|nt|gambit: the precious 9 spot|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|daman: didn't have a lot of options and chose to be aggressive|pg||
nt|karesz: yesterday my team lost to Gamax, so i wish Gamax won|pg||
pc|h4|nt|neobas: Declarer had 3@S 1@H and 3@C so needs three ruffs|pg||
pc|h5|pc|c5|nt|patricck: shouldn't be a problem|pg||
nt|chick: should do the @S first, then don't have to guess how high to ruff|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|rmb1: Declarer will be feeling more comfortable now he has found both kings|pg||
nt|gambit: sounds like a good sport |pg||
mc|11|nt|sybarra2: might be making too many?|pg||

nt|roswolf: in the other room north's agricultural effort got what it deserved|pg||
nt|jwit: But that will fail as well|pg||
nt|beno b: 4@h is cheaper than 3nt|pg||
nt|roswolf: by lots|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|jwit: Not by lots, by 1 lol|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|beno b: did nit show 5 @h|pg||
pc|s3|nt|beno b: bad suit looks to be 4 long only|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think this is crazy|pg||
nt|roswolf: was 1nt 15-17?|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s4|pc|s9|pg||
nt|vugraphzvw: yes|pg||
nt|jwit: You know I actually don't mind South's treatment, bidding stayman rather than transferring with bad 5 card major.  Treat it as a four card major.  If partner has 4,play 4 of the ...|pg||
nt|jwit: major, otherwise 3NT.  Won't work out here though because of 2-2 spades.|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|pc|hK|pc|h8|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|beno b: with Hs in the short suits and very bad 5carder this is a reasonable option|pg||
pc|d6|pc|h3|pc|hA|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sK|nt|roswolf: then why bid game with a yucky minimum - another gross overbid|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|s2|pc|h5|pc|sT|nt|jwit: I guess he fell in love with his five card diamond suit|pg||
nt|beno b: the coulours are tempting|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|cA|nt|roswolf: i know vul games need to be bid but....|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c4|pc|c3|pg||
pc|s6|pc|d7|pc|s7|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|s8|nt|jwit: You know if either hand had a third spade, game would have been excellent|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h9|pc|dT|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cT|pc|c2|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|h4|nt|roswolf: yes but with south not showing his 5 carder how can you judge what the hands fit like|pg||

nt|vugraphzyj: N signaled with the 9@s... and gave a trick away...|pg||
nt|sybarra: that hand may get some discussion .....|pg||
nt|rmb1: so we are in for an exciting day!|pg||
nt|roswolf: i have been doing bbo commentary for a long time and that was truly unbelievable|pg||
nt|xenya: action here|pg||
nt|xenya: perhaps|pg||
nt|rodal f: A bit more interesting board.|pg||
nt|vugraphzvx: hi all|pg||
nt|xenya: hi Csaba|pg||
nt|peachy: This is the first board of the 4th segment|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but South could have reopened with 2@d - or even 2@h|pg||
nt|peachy: 49 was...|pg||
nt|shevek: good point Ralf|pg||
nt|ralfwil: N is probably short in @d|pg||
nt|bobh1: so they played ping pong in the @H suit|pg||
nt|karesz: every single point counts|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|vugraphzvx: im ready with the names :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: here EW might go go overboard but perhaps they will stay in a good 3NT contract|pg||
nt|sybarra: in the recap |pg||
nt|rmb1: 1@C strong artificial (I guess)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Csaba, so not Hanna:)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I prefer dbl as S. not 1@s|pg||
nt|shevek: 1@s is the correct bid by south|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  1@s for me too|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|ady: nothing much here    |pg||
nt|vugraphzvx: no :)|pg||
nt|daman: EW should reach the @H game      NShave a useful vulnerable sacrifice|pg||
mb|3N|nt|april7: 6@C is a possible contrACT|pg||
nt|peachy: Looks like EW play prevision|pg||
nt|shevek: the idea is "don't double if you don't want partner to leave it in sometimes"|pg||
nt|lestergold: routine 4@h e/w not the right colours for save in 4¬s|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: 6@C is a lucky contract, but not 6@D|pg||
nt|ady: need to stop around 1NT|pg||
nt|peachy: precision|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: indeed think west should pass here|pg||
nt|neobas: I don't like the 3NT rebid tbh|pg||
nt|neobas: I usually play it as solid diamonds and a bit too much to open a Gambling 3NT|pg||
nt|april7: no W is thinking about a 6 @C contract and will have the luck to make it if he decides to do it|pg||
nt|neobas: Anyone for 3@D?|pg||
nt|roswolf: but 4@C may be ok provided they could stop in 4NT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: is North worth a positive (if 1@c is strong)?|pg||
nt|ady: west may compete|pg||
nt|rodal f: Not easy to find a @D lead from W if 5@S|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  West has chosen to show a limit raise which is about right I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: 3@D is the more normal rebid...  I don't think 3NT is such an ugly choice tho|pg||
nt|rmb1: I can't find convention cards on line: I think this is a picture of East http://www.bridzs.hu/node/184/52|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is sane so far|pg||
pc|s3|nt|roswolf: AH AH|pg||
nt|neobas: "My @C are more solid than your @D"|pg||
nt|roswolf: now a major cue?|pg||
nt|neobas: :)|pg||
nt|april7: now 4 @D and then 6@C perhaps|pg||
nt|gambit: great lead for the def|pg||
nt|bobh1: he knows his pd has support for @Ss|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|roswolf: 1nt?|pg||
nt|xenya: even 4@S goes down here on an inspired @D lead...|pg||
nt|ralfwil: not on a 3-suiter. We can miss all possible fits|pg||
nt|daman: 4@S is only -1|pg||
nt|gambit: 3H was pass or correct |pg||
pc|s4|nt|chick: Signaling Rule  2:  Never signal with a trick.|pg||
nt|shevek: east bid 3NT dutyfully|pg||
nt|daman: makes with @Ss 2-2|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|roswolf: now e/w should get to 6@C|pg||
nt|sybarra: and   1 is?|pg||
nt|panja: 1@S pass might be the best spot...|pg||
nt|roswolf: we shall see|pg||
nt|panja: would have been difficult to make 7 tricks in 1Nt|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this looks like a normal pass for South now|pg||
nt|ady: cam ,ake 9 tricks in hearts|pg||
nt|lestergold: might weven make but at these colours they tend not to be bid|pg||
nt|gambit: finesse, spades, next hand |pg||
pc|h2|nt|rmb1: Another auction you do not see that often (with opener passing 1S)|pg||
nt|rmb1: In the other match, 1@C was an little as an ordinary 16, so North is probably not worth a positive|pg||
pc|hA|nt|rodal f: Easyer if E doubble|pg||
nt|xenya: now... -- no, almost impossible to find...|pg||
nt|vugraphzvx: Lakatos is thinking|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|roswolf: must avoid 6NT|pg||
nt|patricck: 6@C can be beaten on a @H lead as long as when the Q@S is run on the first round of the suit South ducks|pg||
nt|april7: W should ofcourse pull trumps before giving up a @S|pg||
nt|roswolf: that would be tough i think|pg||
nt|april7: 6NT possible except on @H lead,but S will lead @H ofcourse|pg||
nt|patricck: sorry, stupid of me, diamonds don't need to be set up in clubs|pg||
nt|chick: Signaling Rule  1:  Every card is a signal (whether you mean it or not)|pg||
nt|peachy: well, I take it back, I really dont know|pg||
nt|chick: prevision is good too :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: if opps dont attack clubs in time....|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you come across lots of new things on BBO|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and 1@d-1@S=GF is sure new to a lot of us|pg||
pc|s5|nt|rodal f: Well. @H10 give a signal. Might it'll come|pg||
nt|xenya: great!|pg||
nt|daman: it was up to South over 1NT   if he passes they never get in|pg||
pc|sK|nt|rodal f: Yes. Well done|pg||
pc|sA|nt|april7: well done!|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm that was cool|pg||
nt|neobas: NS will dislike the lucky slam this early|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes they will feel luck isnt with them|pg||
pc|s8|nt|yo_yo: new to me, yes|pg||
pc|c3|pc|sT|nt|april7: 3NT by E shouldn't be with a singleton @C from W's point of view ofcourse|pg||
nt|roswolf: possibly|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|chick: kinda depends on what 1@D means|pg||
nt|mdgraham: probably 13 cards, some of them high ones |pg||
nt|peachy: kib says 'short diamonds, may have both majors'|pg||
nt|chick: cute :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzvx: EW plays precision|pg||
nt|sundiszno: hi all from the site|pg||
nt|peachy: He said already earlier, but I remember from earlier sessions (IFRC) that EW played precision|pg||
nt|peachy: ohm there it is, thanks Csaba|pg||
nt|peachy: Hi Magyar|pg||
pc|s6|nt|sybarra2: oh dear way too many|pg||
pc|d5|pc|s7|nt|jcwla: Hi all.|pg||
nt|lestergold: and who comes in with that scrappy spade suit and a mere ace and king|pg||
nt|bobh1: he did save a trick by not trying the @d hook|pg||
nt|gambit: and more|pg||
nt|gambit: squeezing the dummy |pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|roswolf: defence on the ball i think|pg||
nt|panja: difficult part will come up after cashing @DJ|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North might have unblocked there|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Walddk5: Welcome Jordan|pg||
pc|h5|nt|sybarra: weclome Jordan,  good to see you agian |pg||
nt|sybarra2: will be a bit messy|pg||
pc|h6|nt|chick: Hi Jordan :)|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|bobh1: or is it -3 either way?|pg||
nt|bobh1: E may be wondering why he didn't hook a @D|pg||
nt|bobh1: and conclude he lacks the Q|pg||
nt|gambit: J perhaps |pg||

nt|beno b: N played well to save an ndertrick|pg||
nt|roswolf: a clear slam to bid but the danger is bidding the grand|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm i suppose that's fair grrumphh|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|jwit: My regular partner and I play 4D here would show a void|pg||
mb|2N!|an|4+!H GF|nt|roswolf: the mirror major suit distribution may not be easy to diagnose|pg||
mb|p|nt|jwit: 2NT a rather interesting call!!!|pg||
nt|sundiszno: that is Jacoby|pg||
nt|roswolf: in the other room there was a @D barrage which helped keep n/s low|pg||
nt|jwit: Still interesting with that distribution|pg||
mb|4D|an|void|nt|sundiszno: 4+@h and GF|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: yes i prefer to bid @S|pg||
nt|jwit: I would opt for a splinter, or better yet, a void showing splinter|pg||
nt|beno b: 4@d: void, I guess|pg||
nt|beno b: N is surprised to hear a void in his singleton|pg||
nt|sundiszno: north hasn't got a void|pg||
nt|roswolf: now this is the sort of auction i envisaged might lead them to bid the grand|pg||
nt|beno b: but this willslow doen his interest in grand|pg||
nt|sundiszno: 'st he is checking the system in his head: is this REALLY a @d void? :)|pg||
nt|beno b: difficutl bidding situation|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No that partner is void in diamonds, Nikolits's hand wold be better with one diamond more and one black card less|pg||
nt|beno b: n can see that coontrols are not enough|pg||
nt|Walddk2: *Now|pg||
nt|beno b: tricks are needed as well|pg||
nt|sundiszno: yes, small diamonds in nikolits's hand are tricks, small clubs are loosers|pg||

nt|jwit: Good judgement being content with the small slam|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|h2|pc|h6|pg||
nt|beno b: N should have chceked back somehow|pg||

nt|jcwla: 20/20 hand|pg||
nt|xenya: incidentally, E could bid 5@D instead of 5@H, making things easier for partner |pg||
nt|sundiszno: we had some technical problems with the dealing machine, especially it is broken, so we dealt this set by hand|pg||
nt|sundiszno: if there'll be a misdeal, you won't be able to follow that, sorry for the inconvenience|pg||

nt|karesz: single opposite sicane|pg||

mb|d|nt|roswolf: on bd1 in the other room the sane 4@H was reached and earnt 1 imp for royston|pg||
nt|panja: y|pg||
nt|rmb1: I don't like 2@S on 2 aces|pg||

nt|sundiszno: hungarian style :)|pg||
nt|shevek: 2@s a bit timid?|pg||
nt|karesz: chicane=void|pg||
mb|r|nt|lestergold: predictable auction here|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: the colours have dampenes west's ardour|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Hasan A Zaidi|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3NT best|pg||
nt|yo_yo: maybe 3@H isnt forcing so he has to go thro 2NT?|pg||

nt|peachy: know|pg||
nt|daman: yes    top tricks|pg||
nt|gambit: what should South call? |pg||
mb|4S|nt|ady: south balance with suitable shape   only 8 hcp   but passed in first seat|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Game needs 2-2 spades and a correct diamond guess so no more than about 20%|pg||
mb|p|nt|famus: hello everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzvx: yeah, it is|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I think 2@s is ok because you expect some of those cards will not be working|pg||
nt|shevek: on @h lead no need to guess @d|pg||

nt|sybarra2: here we go|pg||
nt|karesz: What this 4 @s mean? asking for aces?|pg||
nt|gambit: cheapest control? |pg||
nt|karesz: i think it was RKC and the answer is 2 aces from 5 and void |pg||
nt|sybarra2: better have agreements on this |pg||
nt|bobh1: they have to diagnose the @C loser|pg||
mb|6H|nt|daman: words cannot express how I feel about the 1NT rebid|pg||

nt|daman: nmf|pg||
nt|yo_yo: I agree with your sentiments George|pg||
nt|gambit: @C by N?|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: weak NT and stayman|pg||

nt|mdgraham: and succeeds in his mission - push 'em up|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Hasan and well come|pg||
nt|xenya: NS cam make 6@D on this layout|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Hasan|pg||
nt|xenya: what about 3N? |pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Kath|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: looks like S downgraded his hand...10 with 4333..|pg||
nt|roswolf: ah that explains the bidding which is remarkably sane|pg||
nt|xenya: again, good lead|pg||
nt|rodal f: The same help @DKX as needed in 6@D, but need to find @HQXXX in 6|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: not me|pg||
nt|bobh1: well they avoided a trap i think|pg||
nt|gambit: nicely done by NS|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ady: needed a club lead and heart return|pg||
nt|bobh1: not sure why, but they did|pg||
nt|sybarra2: this should work |pg||
pc|d6|nt|roswolf: i cant wait to see the next e/w effort!?:(:)|pg||
nt|peachy: Q was the right play, to guarantee entry to hearts, which on rare occ could break 5-0|pg||
pc|d4|nt|vugraphzyj: IMPS |pg||
nt|lestergold: not likely to produce a swing this hand|pg||
nt|daman: it remains to be seen if the same auction happens in the OR|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but they right sided the contract |pg||
nt|daman: yes   landed on their feet|pg||
nt|yo_yo: not that it matters on this hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: cant fail on any reasonabole auction all roads lead to 3N|pg||
nt|karesz: so @h as trump they play 4 @s RKC|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|sybarra2: only a club loser|pg||
pc|hK|nt|panja: this will just make I guess..it needs backward @H finesse to make 9 tricks|pg||
nt|mdgraham: hmmph-  wanton waste of the @D7|pg||
nt|shevek: and on @d lead you know who has the ace :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: east will always seek a diamond guard from west and west will be the no trumper|pg||
pc|hT|nt|april7: otherwise losing 2 @S if K is singleton with W|pg||
nt|panja: strictly...pinning @HT...rather than backward finesse|pg||
nt|roswolf: would be cool play though|pg||
pc|h3|nt|neobas: NS were actually on the Israel U26 squad that took the gold medal in Philadelphia last October|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|famus: this lead wud be a killer--as long as W unblocks|pg||
pc|h6|nt|panja: @D4 on last trick was a bad play..and @D continuation here is worse|pg||
nt|peachy: due to good spadespots + Q, declarer can go after the overtrick without jepardizing contract|pg||
pc|d3|nt|famus: didnt come to that|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|pg||
nt|karesz: he can make with 4-1 @s, if club is working|pg||
nt|sybarra2: can we have commentators claim?|pg||
nt|karesz: :):)|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sT|pc|s3|pc|s5|pg||
nt|xenya: if S plays a small @D from hand, E should throw th 8, giving declarer a losing choice -- play for 108 in the E hand|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sJ|pc|sA|pc|s7|pg||
nt|rmb1: I don't think there will be a late enty to dummy to cash @D7 at the end :)|pg||

pc|c3|pc|c5|pc|cA|nt|xenya: but this is immaterial now|pg||

nt|rmb1: Some one on BBF recommended leaving @D7 in dummy with no interest in the beer card, but hoping the defence would think you were interested|pg||
nt|xenya: two healthy results for GAMAX|pg||

mb|1S|nt|chick: (with a passed partner besides) :)|pg||

mb|d|nt|mdgraham: here's a Roland slam|pg||
nt|ady: as they lay a sllam is on for east west   can actually make 13 tricks with diamond position|pg||

mb|p|nt|rodal f: 19HP EW for best spot|pg||
nt|peachy: rhis hand looks dull to me|pg||

mb|p|nt|sybarra: may nt|pg||

mb|p|nt|april7: missunderstanding?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: must be natural 2@C, not drury|pg||
nt|daman: yes|pg||
nt|sybarra2: did pard have leb as option?|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: you would want to play 3NT here...a ot of work to make 5@D|pg||
nt|sybarra: may not have been my choice|pg||
nt|roswolf: and 3@C probably denies a fit|pg||
nt|panja: good scheme|pg||
nt|rmb1: Is East worth one try?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: one would think so - but maybe 4@C would be natural|pg||
nt|shevek: dbl = tko of @h|pg||
nt|lestergold: difficult rebid for east so chooses to defend|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: Difficult/dangerous/fearless for South to bid 10xxxxx at the 3-level VUL|pg||
nt|peachy: good guess Kath :)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mdgraham: it also depends on what 2NT-4@h means. This sequence may suggest slam-try vlaues  |pg||
nt|shevek: very gutsy...|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s4|nt|april7: if 2@D is nonforcing; S should cue the @C|pg||
nt|peachy: Breathtaking bravery vulnerable|pg||
nt|yo_yo: looks like Dumbovich has converted a plus score to a minus|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Those kind of doubles are dangerous because RHO might redouble and you don't have much defence|pg||
nt|shevek: vulnerable too....|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Especially when you're not even sure a diamond lead will be best|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|panja: the thought itself is dangerous|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ady: I used to play a direct raise to 4@S after 2NT was this kind of hand  but  the west hand would not have gone any further |pg||
pc|h2|nt|peachy: Maybe W didn't double because his partner opened in third seat, potentially dogpoo|pg||
nt|mdgraham: interesting turn of phrase... |pg||
pc|h3|nt|shevek: declarer can pitch a @s on the 4th club|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|ralfwil: declarer must play on @s and not @c finess to make (discard a @c on 4th @s)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|rodal f: Why did S want to be in? @C from N would been best|pg||
nt|daman: on this side of the pond the East hand would be opened with Flannery 50% of the time    a very popular convention here|pg||
pc|h4|nt|rmb1: There is room to play this sequence, or 4 level transfer, or direct 4@S as a mild slam try|pg||
nt|yo_yo: we are struggling with south's name, we cant abbreviate it|pg||
pc|h5|nt|rmb1: Less so if partner can flash @HAKx|pg||
nt|mdgraham: agree with West, though. Why double opposite a third-hand opener and possibly struggle to get 200? Not worth it   |pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|chick: Spell it "south" :)|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Or a club on the fourth spade :)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sybarra2: and another claim coming up|pg||
nt|karesz: do U want to claim again Shirley?|pg||
mc|9|nt|patricck: I guess it depends how fast and loose you play the 1 level overcall...  |pg||
nt|roswolf: a spec says "not supporting with North is ridiculous" i agree|pg||
nt|april7: but  still forcing or not,that is the question!!!|pg||
nt|roswolf: true but you must bid the full value of your hand|pg||
nt|neobas: I like to play it as nf, can always cuebid with good hands|pg||
nt|april7: so, cue!!|pg||
nt|roswolf: agree|pg||
nt|patricck: The 6@C slam was worth 10 Imps to team 1|pg||
nt|mdgraham: useful to have a distinction between 2NT-3@h (xfer)-3@s-4@s and 2NT-4@h-4@S|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it's against our principals to let them play at the one -level but what else?|pg||

nt|rodal f: 3@D ask for hold I belive. |pg||
nt|sybarra2: wouldnt we all like to know what we do as commentators and specs?|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s have performed very solidly thus far - no doubt now the commentators curse will strike|pg||
nt|rmb1: EW have only an eight card fit but maybe do not know about the dounble fit in @C which makes 3@H more attractive|pg||
nt|xenya: accurate prediction, Hasan|pg||
pc|sK|nt|panja: well..East opened 1@D..|pg||
nt|roswolf: fair point robin|pg||
pc|s5|nt|roswolf: one of my rules when playing against juniors is in defence ALWAYS be prepared that they are MINIMUM for their bidding|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pg||
nt|panja: sorry..1@C|pg||
nt|famus: a @d ruff ought to see this home|pg||
pc|s9|nt|jcwla: Well, I think the value shown by that sequence changes when pd has shown 9-11 or so as here, have to be able to search for best game.|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT on the same finesse as 6@C  on the spade lead|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sA|pc|s8|pg||
nt|daman: they bid like this at the club on a lazy Tuesday afternoon|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|roswolf: probably phoney|pg||
nt|panja: East opened 1@C...and it is supposed to be natural...|pg||
nt|rmb1: But 1@C only shows four in the sleepy back-waters of Acolland (e.g. Devon and Sussex)|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|gambit: amzing how that thought is lost on so many, and it is too easy to be critical from up here in the crow's nest, I like to have fun commenting, think I will go download some of ...|pg||
nt|gambit: Edgar's great vuG quotes...|pg||
pc|h5|nt|peachy: As opener, I would have passed Rdbl, but ithe XX was alerted so they may have a specific agreement on it|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|april7: S can make 3@D so no swing|pg||
pc|c5|nt|jcwla: Nice thoughtful X by N of the 3@D.|pg||
nt|rmb1: Can cash @CA to drop the king and then @D finesse|pg||
nt|ralfwil: perhaps 1@s with 10 black cards is a little bit weak|pg||
pc|c2|nt|chick: perhaps, but should E not bid 3@H over the X?|pg||
nt|famus: but GAMAX seem to b on a roll--in the other room|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but homon hasnt a regular 2@S bid|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|yo_yo: well they missed their game|pg||
pc|h9|nt|yo_yo: depends on getting the trumps right|pg||
nt|lestergold: double fit slams are hard to reach on limited point counts unless you p[lay things like fit jumps|pg||
pc|h2|nt|yo_yo: not easy to find a 2nd suit fit when first is agreed|pg||
nt|daman: Meckwell would be digging for the grand by now|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|famus: a @s back n a @c pitch by declarer|pg||
nt|rodal f: Y. 3NT and @H lead for +2|pg||
nt|sybarra2: we have such a specila view and too easy to criticize (imo)  |pg||
pc|cK|nt|ady: suppose cpould cchoose to finesse diamond   pr cash ace and king of diamonds   and when queen does not appear  take club finesse|pg||
pc|c4|nt|jcwla: I agree Cornelia, I would.|pg||
pc|c8|nt|neobas: If I would have opened the E hand I would have preferred to raise to 2@S|pg||
pc|sT|pg||

nt|roswolf: good point Bas|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2 in Hove Sussex robin!!|pg||
nt|panja: this should have been a case where natural opening and support redouble helps a side in cometing to 3 level|pg||
nt|rmb1: Another slam.  Surely right to bid this one|pg||
nt|ady: another slam|pg||
nt|mdgraham: certainly swing potential in the last two boards|pg||
nt|yo_yo: slam time|pg||
nt|yo_yo: easy to make, difficult to bid |pg||
nt|peachy: Is E hand too gor Precision 2C?|pg||

nt|shevek: of course easy when you see the cards :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzvx: Lakatos said he is sorry|pg||
nt|shevek: thx Csaba :)|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  If North's lead is honest and South has four clubs I would bet on 3424 rather than 4414 and North 4135|pg||
nt|lestergold: boring 3n here|pg||
nt|daman: don't we think East would have become quite enthusiastic had west bid a routine 3@C?|pg||
nt|gambit: Like "Declarer could try a non-working squeeze." |pg||
nt|bobh1: continuing in the partscore skirmish vein|pg||
mb|1C|nt|peachy: Six controls is a bit of an overload for a 11-15 opening|pg||
nt|peachy: Szots agreed, he upgraded it to 16+|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: Jordan, what would you play the 3@DX to mean if you were South?|pg||
nt|roswolf: this might be a trappy hand for e/w|pg||
nt|shevek: Galim got 3 imps in bd !|pg||
nt|shevek: 1|pg||
nt|shevek: it was honest I thought|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|ady: this one secure   just a heart loser if cashed|pg||
nt|famus: chance for oystan -if they can hit 5@cs and manage it|pg||
nt|xenya: this might be interesting|pg||
nt|famus: Roysston|pg||
nt|shevek: they lead 3/5|pg||
nt|ralfwil: is this correct bidding?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: depends what it shows,  does it promise a suit or is it a trial bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: would we know too if our partners bid it|pg||
nt|bobh1: EW have the high cards but no fit|pg||
mb|1N|nt|daman: it would typically be a suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: because of ruffingvalue in @D!!!|pg||
mb|2N|nt|roswolf: anothe flippant although "system"bid|pg||
nt|april7: look at that!!|pg||
nt|neobas: I recently started playing 2@H as both Majors and I must say I really do like it|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this looks eminently biddable. Highly likely that Blackwood will appear at some point |pg||
nt|xenya: may be not so easy to locate the @C fit|pg||
nt|famus: 2@cs wud /shud excite N|pg||
nt|xenya: easy enough :)|pg||
nt|famus: might splinter in @hs|pg||
nt|xenya: or pass|pg||
nt|shevek: 3@s, really Csaba?|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Did they play it upside down?|pg||

nt|vugraphzvx: lead @c|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: A or K|pg||
nt|roswolf: this might not be a pleasant spot|pg||
nt|shevek: so 5@d played by south?|pg||
nt|bobh1: NS have a fit but it is in the suit E opened|pg||
nt|gambit: "After all, E/W have a clear majority of the points (21)" |pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: trump lead should be the norm here..|pg||
nt|rmb1: Previous stanza (different team) 1NT=12-16, 2@C GF relay|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North could simply ask for aces over the 1NT opening, whatever their methods are for that |pg||
nt|ady: north hand seems right for a direct ace asking bid and then appropriate level in diamonds|pg||
nt|vugraphzvx: yes|pg||
nt|shevek: ok|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: great pass by North, but it didnt help much that E wusely upgraded, they have better contract available as we all see, tough at the table|pg||
pc|h6|nt|patricck: NS can make 4@S with the A@C onside and the Q@S probably being picked up, but it was never very likely they could bid it|pg||
nt|roswolf: as north i would have thought i must invite here -any idea about the range of 2@H?|pg||
nt|neobas: 6-10 probably|pg||
nt|roswolf: ok then not to invite|pg||
nt|xenya: perhaps not the best choice, 2@D|pg||
nt|famus: very conservative|pg||
nt|daman: or at least looking for help in the suit|pg||
nt|yo_yo: so you cant make a 3 card trial bid?|pg||
nt|daman: sure|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sorry for a bit late and hi to all specs + Kath - George and Mike|pg||
nt|daman: and that's OK too|pg||
nt|bobh1: its 23 Edgar|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lestergold: 11 tricks next case please|pg||
nt|karesz: at least 9 tricks now|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|chick: assuming 3@H is showing a stopper, 4@C looks right for S|pg||
nt|chick: these are juniors, anyone want to bet on 3N?  :):)|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am betting on 6 @D |pg||
nt|jcwla: If I had one bid for my life as S it would be 6@C.|pg||
nt|sybarra: or 6 @C |pg||
nt|chick: all the kibs are voting for 5@D|pg||
nt|mdgraham: still, NS have presumably paid their entry fee, so they will want to make as many bids as possible|pg||
nt|rmb1: More IMPs back to Dumbovich on  18: 4@H-1 by NS 6IMPs|pg||
nt|ady: agree Mike   this auction should be around 4 bids|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|roswolf: the attitude signal (reverse I am told) wont help south much here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes indeed - 4@d was just right |pg||
nt|yo_yo: great bid by south puts the cat amongst the pigeons|pg||
nt|lestergold: 10 sorry|pg||
nt|daman: so  if West bid 3@C     what would have bid as East?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hi there, still dont know how old you are!|pg||
nt|gambit: but the quote was 21  Tobias |pg||
nt|karesz: heart to the 8|pg||
pc|h2|nt|neobas: I don't think I know any juniors who don't play weak 2 openings haha|pg||
nt|sybarra: will we hear 6 '@C?|pg||
nt|sybarra: or 6 @D?|pg||
nt|sybarra: or just 5 @D.... |pg||
nt|sybarra: my bet is on 6 @D |pg||
nt|sybarra: I like 5 @S as suggested by a spec |pg||
nt|jcwla: It is hard to imagine N not going on - a jump like this, right or wrong, should show this type of hand - including worry about @S that N knows is no problemo.|pg||
nt|chick: I think 5@D, N is still not sure how good S's clubs are|pg||
nt|sybarra: more I think about it 5 @S is right |pg||
nt|jcwla: And primo @C's.|pg||
nt|jcwla: N may fear that has shown better @C than actually has but that ship has sailed.|pg||
nt|sybarra: N should know 6 level is ok,   dont you think?|pg||
nt|jcwla: Totally.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: hmm - this seems to be over-complicating things|pg||
pc|h7|nt|panja: not the best lead..but a daring good continuation|pg||
nt|roswolf: good switch though|pg||
nt|daman: Hi|pg||
pc|h8|nt|rmb1: Hope South recognises this is the end of the auction|pg||
nt|mdgraham: This hand is ideal for one of Roland's unfavourite conventions|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|rmb1: In open room, NS bid to 3NT on  3 but only -1 for flat.  On  4, NS got in to the auction and reached 4@H-1 for 5IMP (out)|pg||
nt|famus: 3@hs in my opinion wud be more interesting|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|sybarra: so 5 @S should be safe cue|pg||
nt|rodal f: N with a bit to good @C by J10XXX, this time?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jcwla: WD - this is an art not a science so I think they deserve full marks.|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree,  but did "we" miss 7?|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hK|pg||
nt|yo_yo: we better change the name!|pg||
nt|peachy: As long as N doesn't play a heart now, doesn|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 4@D looks attractive|pg||
pc|c8|nt|april7: one disadvantage is it might cut down game investigation|pg||
nt|sybarra: and would you want to be there?|pg||
nt|ady: got there a few bids later|pg||

pc|s9|nt|yo_yo: very difficult for  EW to find their @C fit  after the preempt|pg||

nt|famus: a grand cming up|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: a nice red suit sac on the cards!?|pg||
nt|panja: a 3-loser hand with N..can he show both his suits in one go here?|pg||

nt|panja: on @C|pg||
nt|bobh1: apparently S ducked|pg||

nt|sybarra2: or should be be in 7?? |pg||
nt|gambit: interesting hand|pg||
mb|1H|nt|roswolf: a good hand for ghestem perhaps!?|pg||

nt|famus: if no further intervention--Grand might b bid|pg||

mb|p|nt|sybarra: thx see all later |pg||
nt|bobh1: 7 is too much|pg||

mb|1N|nt|rmb1: "a good hand for ghestem" is there such a thing!  (fine convention when both partners remember/agree)|pg||
nt|roswolf: south will support @S and then north punts the slam is a likely scenario|pg||
nt|panja: S has only 1 bid..and he found it|pg||
nt|rmb1: In previous stanza 1NT in 3rd was not wide range 14-16|pg||
nt|xenya: Gerber?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Belive so|pg||

nt|rmb1: Transfer break to losing doubleton (?)|pg||
nt|ady: north showing a heart fit and shortage  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: the double improves South's @DK|pg||
nt|rmb1: Now 4@D retransfer :)|pg||
nt|ady: certain to bid game I would think|pg||
nt|rmb1: 1N=2D=3D=4D=4H is always a test of partnership understanding|pg||
nt|bobh1: I imagine 2@C is Gazzilli|pg||
mb|3C|nt|jcwla: I would sooner 1@H , those @S are four, not five.|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is practical|pg||
nt|famus: 4@cs has set the suit--there u go|pg||
nt|vugraphzvx: it was orkc|pg||
nt|shevek: leaping michaels|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  World's weakest ever leaping Michaels|pg||
nt|lestergold: i feel 2n coming on and 2 off|pg||
nt|daman: a @H lead would be inspired|pg||
nt|lestergold: not difficult to lay down A@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: so its ok!|pg||
nt|jcwla: But with @H 4-4 no problem.|pg||
nt|panja: a 2-suiter overcall might have made this too complicated....simple 1@S was far more effective|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Winkler has to lead one and Geller wont go up with A or K|pg||
nt|gambit: I sure hope 3@C is forcing|pg||
nt|bobh1: even if not N will not pass it|pg||
nt|bobh1: he has a huge hand|pg||
mb|6C|nt|roswolf: another good auction by n/s|pg||
nt|famus: 4@hs 03|pg||
nt|gambit: Is Gazilli related to Garrozo?|pg||

mb|p|nt|roswolf: agreed prakash|pg||
nt|lestergold: even if nmaybe only 1 off now if west c ashes out|pg||
nt|sybarra2: apparently|pg||
nt|karesz: i think 2 @c was natural|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: y, brb|pg||
mb|p|nt|neobas: I don't see why Fisher didn't bid 1@H|pg||
nt|neobas: North might still have 4@H?|pg||
nt|bobh1: if 2@c was natural it was the underbid of the century|pg||
nt|sybarra2: over 1 nt forcing.... 2 @C could be only 3 clubs right?|pg||
nt|karesz: yes|pg||
nt|bobh1: only 2@Cs if 4522|pg||
nt|gambit: trump lead?|pg||
nt|karesz: it was underbid, so came 6 @c to show the power!!!!|pg||
nt|sybarra2: does it really matter?  except for style pts?|pg||
nt|bobh1: i'd like to know whether 2@Cs was really natural...i doubt it|pg||
nt|gambit: What does 2@C Gazzili show?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|rmb1: play should be quick|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not likely to want to play in 4@d having been doubled in 3@d|pg||
nt|famus: well bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: or will he try another spade i dont think it will work|pg||
nt|karesz: with 3rd K @s onside 13 tricks are easy|pg||
nt|bobh1: depends on how you play it but it is forcing and artificial (sometimes)|pg||
pc|d5|nt|rmb1: On  19, North lead @HK against 3S, +1. 1IMP to Dumbovich|pg||
pc|d2|nt|roswolf: agreed|pg||

nt|lestergold: north might know what to do now|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|yo_yo: upside down attitude?  2@H?|pg||
nt|bobh1: shows either a normal 2@c rebid or some stronger hand|pg||

pc|c4|nt|april7: I think he shouldn't, in my system:)|pg||
nt|neobas: Why?|pg||
nt|neobas: Maybe 2@H|pg||

nt|gambit: 4@S|pg||
mb|4C!|an|cue|nt|jcwla: Do you force to game or invite?|pg||
nt|rmb1: On  5 in open room, neither side found their major suit fit and NS bid 3@D= over 3@C|pg||
nt|famus: 5@cs penalty-wud result in 5@hx--looks like|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@H by South?|pg||
nt|gambit: 4@c should be a cue bid or even nat, not gerber |pg||
mb|d|nt|rodal f: With a OK sac in @C EW, but...|pg||
nt|gambit: now South can double |pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: Another EW auction done in by the commentators curse|pg||
nt|ady: 20-20   2@D looks like majors    seems a bit flat  with a good ration of the points in diamonds|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes|pg||
nt|mdgraham: probably 4@h-4@s now|pg||
nt|sybarra2: W should maybe bass for the XX form E?|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: Ah no. the auction is still alive!|pg||
nt|rmb1: 2@D = majors or S+another?  Pretty ugly looking either way|pg||
nt|xenya: but perhaps the auction will be peaceful, with EW silent|pg||
nt|gambit: Ewill place the contract in game |pg||
mb|4S|nt|famus: xfer|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: on bd 4 "the other room" bid and made 5@D!|pg||
mb|p|nt|karesz: 6 @s can be made after @c lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: may well get Q@H wrong|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  It can easily be a hand where nobody makes more than 8 tricks in anything and they have an easy double|pg||
nt|shevek: I like south's overcall|pg||
nt|lestergold: cant see this 2N makling|pg||
nt|gambit: with double finesses in hearts....not a sound spot unless miles behind and in need of the Hail Mary...|pg||
pc|c4|nt|rmb1: not now|pg||
nt|ady: not now|pg||
nt|famus: E must come in soon with Cs b4 too late|pg||
nt|shevek: if you ever overcall with a 4-card suit, this is the hand|pg||
nt|shevek: length in their suit and AKTx|pg||
pc|cA|nt|roswolf: might play in 4@H|pg||
nt|patricck: KaplanRuben hand evaluator thinks the west hand is worth 17.95. Despite the lack of filling 10's and 9's I thought 1NT might not be enough|pg||
nt|yo_yo: North needs a ruff|pg||
nt|peachy: S.J.Simon says "when in doubt, bid one more".  NS should have listened. Or else, they have No Doubt and happy to defend 4S|pg||
nt|yo_yo: North is happy to defend but he has to beat it|pg||
pc|c8|nt|xenya: don't think he can do that|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|april7: 5@D will most probably go down on this distribution|pg||
nt|roswolf: I wonder how strong east's bidding is !?|pg||
nt|jcwla: Once pd shows four, wild horses couldn't keep me out.  Might not make but we will never know during the auction and for one extra trick we get 300 extra points.|pg||
nt|chick: switch the @HKQ with the @DAJ and it's not nearly as good a contract|pg||

nt|rmb1: East just blasted slam via blackwood (after 4-level transfer)|pg||
nt|peachy: First seat favorable can logically take liberties, because the odds are he is preempting opponents (two of them) more often than partner (1 of them)|pg||

mb|3N!|an|sirius|nt|shevek: hi Patrick|pg||
nt|bobh1: cant see a slam opposite a limit raise|pg||
nt|bobh1: so hopefully 3N is natural 18-19|pg||
mb|p|nt|neobas: E not thrilled by the 3@D response|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@S IS DANGEROUS|pg||
nt|neobas: I play 4@S here as a Namyats, I think the hand is worth more than that|pg||
nt|april7: if 3@D is positive, why not 4NT by E!!!???|pg||
nt|neobas: All depends on methods|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed |pg||
nt|roswolf: west should blackwood hinself i think|pg||
nt|april7: it only depends on aces and ofcourse sometimes which|pg||
nt|april7: 4NT by W doesn't serve much|pg||
nt|roswolf: sorry that adds a different dimension|pg||
nt|neobas: 4@S looks to show 9 tricks with @S as trumps|pg||
nt|april7: interchange ace of @H with ace of @C and down you go|pg||
nt|april7: not really, @C would be 3-3 for discard!!|pg||
nt|patricck: well, that would still be a slam that I would want to be in|pg||
nt|roswolf: silver lining|pg||
nt|april7: ofcourse, we all went already down in certain slams:):)|pg||
nt|roswolf: west must bid on 2 aces are golddust on this bidding|pg||
nt|patricck: with A@C the 3-3 break unnecessary except on a diamond lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzyj: Hila is thinking... seems not sure what to do here...|pg||
nt|chick: I teach the rebid is 2@H if the suit is strong, 2@C if it is not|pg||
nt|peachy: heh :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: homonnay can visualize game if his partner has a major|pg||
mb|4S|nt|peachy: @C = 16+ any|pg||
mb|p|nt|neobas: wow|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup it has|pg||
nt|rmb1: X = 3 card support|pg||
nt|ady: dbl support  showing 3 hearts|pg||
nt|peachy: 1C|pg||
mb|5C|nt|roswolf: le junior punt works here|pg||
nt|rmb1: NS didn't use Ghestem earlier so I suppose we have to allow them an F-convention|pg||
nt|roswolf: and the finesse of the spade 10 is marked|pg||
nt|rodal f: Still I would have goone for a balance X at last board.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3@d? why not 2nt?|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: well done|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: not the strongest of suits for South to bid|pg||
nt|shevek: there are a few better contracts indeed|pg||
nt|lestergold: but here we can visualise a part score going down...|pg||
mb|5H|nt|neobas: Never argue with success :)|pg||
nt|april7: W must continue with the 2 aces, E has only 19 points, could easily have more|pg||
nt|patricck: EW don't get any plus scores except when they bid slam :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: quick claim|pg||
nt|april7: well done|pg||
nt|jcwla: Light opening by S.  Double a reasonable choice by W.  N might have bid @S.  Nobody has anywhere to go over 2@C.|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: many play 2N here as Lebensohl style, as relay to 3@C for a weak hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: 1 trick given|pg||
nt|lestergold: but not enuf|pg||
mb|p|nt|famus: will make now|pg||
nt|xenya: on 38, NS in the other room did bid all the way to 5@C -- down 1 and 6 imps for the trailing team|pg||
nt|peachy: I dont have their conv card, it is Precision, but what responses etc they play, I do not know, nor of their NT opening range|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@c a slight upgrade, but the spade suit is good |pg||
mb|p|nt|pjs_ch: there could easily be game on here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hello Patrick|pg||
nt|vugraphzvx: yeah, its lebensohl situation|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Also partner will usually bid clubs with 4-4 in the minors|pg||
nt|karesz: he can see slam...|pg||
mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  If it was scrambling|pg||
nt|rodal f: Same as yesterday Kath. Nice cards for specs and hard onec for the players|pg||
nt|bobh1: or he may go down|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ady: again cards lay wellfordeclarer|pg||
nt|karesz: he will make with @C J onside!|pg||
nt|bobh1: i guess the @C J in the slot will save him|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ady: may well make11tricks|pg||
nt|peachy: they found the best contract, IMO|pg||
nt|shevek: thx Csaba, yes|pg||
pc|h7|nt|peachy: FYI, operator is typing in explanations, please scross over the bids to see them|pg||
nt|peachy: scroll|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hJ|nt|yo_yo: you have to admire the bidding:0|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h8|pg||
nt|ady: hand 22   6@D made with an overtrick|pg||
nt|peachy: 'Best' is relative.  If East decides to play spades to be 4-2 and cashes the jack of spades, hoping one of his kings is an entry, he may go down about four tricks.|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c4|pc|cK|nt|famus: yes thats wht i predicted--some imps to roy on that board|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|rmb1: South opened a nebulous 1@D and West did not lead a @H|pg||
pc|c5|nt|bobh1: he's not totally sure that's his only play|pg||
nt|karesz: but @D A at N would be enough as well|pg||
nt|bobh1: could be the @S Q is dub|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c2|nt|roswolf: for lurkers|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|shevek: north's doubles are known to be a bit thin (see bd 4 )|pg||

nt|rmb1: On  8, EW played in 4@C-4 after East bid 1@S - looks like a misunderstanding.  12IMP to GAMAX and the lead|pg||
nt|xenya: but on the next board (39) EW failed to bid grand -- 12 imps to GAMAX|pg||
nt|famus: 5@s @dA and @hA= -1|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it's an easy game to play badly |pg||
nt|peachy: It is typical Precision bidding philosophy: one side asks, the other answers, opposite of natural bidding where hand qualities etc. are often shown instead of asked|pg||
nt|peachy: the match remains tight, the 4th segment started at 116-117, now again only 1 IMP difference|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Ew bid their @C game in the OR on 54|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: but it feels wrong to pass as North, doesn't it?|pg||
nt|shevek: agree|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I agree with the bidding and would have gone -500 probably|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 6-5 come alive|pg||
nt|gambit: whew.......next time, bid more economicaly |pg||
nt|bobh1: good play exonerates dubious bidding|pg||
nt|karesz: but listen to South very good lead: second @C|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|april7: after 2@S OPENING ew MIGHT ALSO REACH $1h AND ALSO GOING DOWN|pg||
nt|april7: 4@H ofcourse|pg||
nt|roswolf: this should end up in 4@H but e/w may stay low|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: this is a more solid double, but a problem for 4th hand|pg||
nt|shevek: 3@s maybe?|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: looks like a NT hand but if partner really is short in spades your A7 looks a limited stop|pg||
mb|1C|nt|chick: are NS playing weak NTs?|pg||
nt|peachy: on 54, however, they missed slam|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  With lebensohl there are two ways to 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: W can't pass now|pg||
nt|shevek: nice bid|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I would choose whichever shows the shakiest 3NT bid|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: for most Lebensohl players 3@S would promise a 4cd heart suit|pg||
nt|shevek: pass says "I'm happy with a @s lead"|pg||
nt|ralfwil: looks like EW can make 4@h on 4-3|pg||
nt|vugraphzvx: pass means he hasnt better idea then @s lead|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: yep - that or 5@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzvx: yes|pg||
nt|ralfwil: also on 4-3|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: or the boring 5@C|pg||
nt|shevek: west might bid 4@h now|pg||
nt|vugraphzvx: *than|pg||
nt|shevek: since no @s stopper|pg||
nt|ralfwil: easiest 5@c |pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I think West should definitely bid 4@c because someone can bid hearts later|pg||
nt|shevek: might sound like a cuebid later :)|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: Will 5@C crumble witht he 4-1 break?|pg||
mb|p|nt|neobas: Surely W will bid 4@H|pg||
nt|lestergold: well not in this auction it never even got born|pg||
nt|gambit: Good play certainly helps justify optimistic or foolhardy bidding |pg||
nt|gambit: E praying for a balncing bid from N |pg||
nt|bobh1: I would respond with the W hand|pg||
nt|gambit: me too, 1@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 1@h=spades...?|pg||
nt|peachy: as lucj would have it, slam missed gained 13|pg||
nt|peachy: luck|pg||
nt|shevek: 4@s is like passing the ball|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But I hadn´t passed on the dbl. at least 3@s|pg||
nt|shevek: what do YOU reckon pd?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: as N:)|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: West must be scared that 4@C is NF and he has extra values|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I think 5@c is ok as long as you are careful to retain West's small club to ruff with|pg||
nt|shevek: choose a minor?|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  East can still use 4NT to pass the buck one more time|pg||
nt|karesz: Galim made 3 NT in the other room so leads by 234 IMPs|pg||
nt|gambit: not 1@H, not 1NT |pg||
nt|karesz: 34 Imps|pg||
pc|d2|nt|patricck: NS need to play an early club to beat 4@H|pg||
nt|roswolf: easts pass was odd imo but may pay dividends|pg||
nt|lestergold: needs a defensive error tho for 3n  to make|pg||
nt|bobh1: me too 1@D|pg||
nt|gambit: another exciting hand |pg||
pc|d4|nt|karesz: but he can make 7 tricks|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|roswolf: this wont play well|pg||
nt|shevek: @cA, @c ruff, etc....|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: wrong suit and the singleton is on lead|pg||
nt|ralfwil: you got it Patrick:)|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  But there are still 11 tricks after that|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: but a club ruff lets it through as spade loser goes on fourth heart?|pg||
nt|bobh1: ud get to 2N|pg||
nt|bobh1: instead of playing in your 5 card fit|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hJ|nt|xenya: this can be defeated but not so easy |pg||
nt|famus: shud b -1 with proper ddef|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|roswolf: if they keep their t/o dbls up to strength - there is a real argument they should pass 3@H BUT the girls have induced the phantom|pg||
nt|april7: 4@H ven makable if @C are not opened|pg||
nt|patricck: If North's 2@S said he didn't like spades much then South bought a very lucky hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: south's bid is ill disciplined|pg||
nt|april7: what should S lead against 4@H?|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|shevek: south remembered that he "passed" for a @s lead :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Can't see how that error will come.|pg||
nt|yo_yo: the speed suggests that the obvious @S isnt so obvious to north|pg||
pc|hA|nt|roswolf: south shouldnt have reopened i think but then i can understand the temptation to do so|pg||
nt|peachy: 1@C = 16+, the rest alerted and I don't have info, syscards are available on the hungarian website, but only in hungarian |pg||
nt|vugraphzvx: we know that about west: he has 5@s bal or 5@s+ club suit|pg||
pc|h5|nt|lestergold: im not expecting one!|pg||
pc|h6|nt|nigel_k:  Tough problem for declarer|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|peachy: The operator in the other room told that the score on board 53 is incorrect here. 4D made. Operator made an error in claiming.|pg||
nt|vugraphzvx: 4@s bid = choose a minor|pg||
nt|yo_yo: well done|pg||
nt|lestergold: dead in water|pg||
nt|vugraphzvx: winkler asked am i in nonvul :)|pg||
pc|hT|nt|famus: tuff under lead @d|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hK|nt|rmb1: Tricky to make 3@H on this layout|pg||

pc|h9|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mdgraham: ty|pg||
pc|sA|nt|patricck: probably would lead a dimaond and the contract makes|pg||

nt|ralfwil: must clean trumps now and play on @h|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s5|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sQ|nt|roswolf: there is an argument for a @D but a top heart is natural|pg||
nt|april7: duck first @D!!|pg||

nt|kareno: Without a diamond lead it can make as well with a winning spade view|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup but should be a swing back to gamax|pg||
nt|jwit: Yes, but not that easy with diamond preempt form East.  Would expect spade shortness there and not with west|pg||
nt|beno b: this is probably an argument against this w2|pg||

nt|daman: this auction just went off the rails|pg||
nt|daman: 4@S seems obvious over 4@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzvx: 3@h is shortness|pg||
nt|yo_yo: if 4@C was the ace and a slam try  he will go on|pg||
nt|daman: and then Easley|pg||
nt|lestergold: doesnt make sense east is emnormous opposite what west has promised|pg||
nt|rodal f: After the 1@D as @H and @S opening|pg||
nt|vugraphzvx: i dont know the others|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: 5@C much to expensive!!|pg||
nt|chick: and an excellent job by Yotam :)|pg||
nt|shevek: they'll stop in 3NT|pg||
mb|3D|nt|daman: doesn't 5@D deny the @S Ace?|pg||
nt|vugraphzvx: Winkler passed with angry|pg||
nt|lestergold: could be a nail in Gamax coffin|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: For sure.|pg||
nt|shevek: if they don't ... :)  they shouldn't open flat 11 in 2nd seat vulnerable anymore |pg||
nt|nigel_k:  From South's point of view, North could still have as many as 15 HCP|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  He may stop but it would be a big position|pg||
nt|daman: so they could be off 2 Aces hypothetically|pg||
mb|4S|nt|famus: time for a drink here--cheers all--am today for irish whisky|pg||
mb|p|nt|pjs_ch: big difference between 11 hcp and 15 in bidding a slam|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|neobas: Oh, right, miscounted haha|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it does seem a slightly odd treatment, having 3@s here pre-emptive. Maybe 1@s followed by 2@s would be more constructive|pg||
nt|peachy: Dumbovich is an active bidder, we have evidence plenty in this match.  Kibitzer messages are highly disapproving of 3S and I agree|pg||
nt|peachy: Moreover, both opponents are passed hands so there was not much to preempt anyway|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it's good to be an active bidder actually, very annoying for opposition|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: South presumably knows there is no fit|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: he could always try with a quantitative 4N|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  They can probably find a tenth trick somewhere as long as they get no higher than 4NT|pg||
nt|shevek: minors don't split, so anything higher than 3NT is too high|pg||
pc|d4|nt|gambit: lots of work and no over-abundance of dummy entries |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|shevek: ok, they earned the right to do it again :)|pg||
pc|dK|nt|pjs_ch: sounds like they found out just enough just in time|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|shevek: EW happy to see such a strong dummy I bet|pg||
nt|shevek: the opening hand is well hidden|pg||
nt|gambit: Q@H|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|neobas: -1100 instead of -500 :)|pg||
nt|rmb1: Claim +1|pg||
nt|bobh1: this hook would not really help him if it works|pg||
pc|h6|nt|shevek: they might even misdefend now allowing an overtrick or two:)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|shevek: like, why play the ace??|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|april7: was this a certain safety play?? I don't think so!!|pg||
nt|neobas: We're restarting in about 40 minutes everyone :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: told 2@s= 5@s+4@h  inv |pg||
nt|chick: 3@S is obviously a weak hand long suit, and they are in the best contract ... other spade bids may have meant stronger hands|pg||
nt|chick: so without knowing their CC, it's hard to disapprove|pg||
nt|daman: cloaim 7|pg||

nt|beno b: E created the problem by opening another suit|pg||
nt|roswolf: perhaps not on reflection|pg||
nt|beno b: not rreturning @s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The problem arose at trick one because EW lead 3rd. If leading 4th East had an easy duck|pg||

nt|mdgraham: what's to disapprove? 3@S made|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: is North here weak enough to open?|pg||
nt|daman: that was not a good demonstration of bidding prowess|pg||
nt|lestergold: and George that was a good demonstration of guarded understatement|pg||
nt|gambit: the diamond lead was a trojan horse, a poisoned fruit |pg||
nt|bobh1: actually it was a gift|pg||
nt|bobh1: which S declined to accept|pg||
nt|gambit: Only if you unwrap it |pg||
nt|bobh1: without the @D he has entry problems|pg||

mb|p|nt|mdgraham: call me a result merchant - :)|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I like it better than his last hand|pg||

mb|1D!|nt|roswolf: e/w will play a partscore 3@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|pjs_ch: East is quite a powerful hand for a weak two|pg||
mb|1S!|nt|rmb1: or not|pg||
nt|roswolf: MAYBE NOT!! |pg||
nt|roswolf: PRESUMABLY east couldnt conveniently bid on his hand|pg||
nt|rmb1:  11 was indeed a small swing to GAMAX. EW 2@S-2 4IMP|pg||
nt|yo_yo: NS heading for a tough 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: now i wonder what S's double meant |pg||
nt|xenya: and what is he to do now?|pg||
nt|vugraphzvx: i think its card showing double|pg||
nt|chick: well, mike, any contract that makes when all others go down is a good one|pg||
nt|mdgraham: seriously, I agree - but maybe South had no other way to bid his hand in the NS system  |pg||
nt|shevek: yes, two aces!|pg||
nt|ralfwil: what else than 41S from N?|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ady: only bid other than passforsouth|pg||
nt|daman: to me he might have had   xx KQxx xxx AKQx|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Belive color since E told a major. But seems to be a bit hard here|pg||
nt|gambit: only a heart gives up nothing immediately, all other leads potentially costly (iF S accepts his gift) Note none of us suggested he rise a trick 1, later of course it was easier to ...|pg||
nt|gambit: spot|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: only 3!|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: South has rescued North here|pg||
nt|vugraphzvx: they called director|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: North might have thought he onyl had a working 7 count|pg||
nt|vugraphzvx: EW called him|pg||
nt|shevek: some hesitations, huh?|pg||
nt|vugraphzvx: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzvx: hesitation|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: Establish one @D for =|pg||
nt|ady: should  not have any problems |pg||
nt|peachy: When 2S was conventional, I would rather have bid 1S thaaaaaaan 3|pg||
nt|mdgraham: sorry all, I have to go now. Looks like an exciting finsih....|pg||
nt|shevek: north had a 3.5@s bid|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: not clear that a slow 3@S shows extra values; it might as easily be short of values|pg||
pc|cK|nt|shevek: agree patrick|pg||
nt|gambit: 3@D, this was not the hand to press on that moth-eaten suit|pg||
pc|cA|nt|lestergold: too tough me Kath-|pg||
nt|lestergold: its a misfit with the cards spittimng to boot|pg||
nt|yo_yo: East has to avoid a major |pg||
nt|yo_yo: j@D looks right|pg||
nt|lestergold: but likely to be flat as only in a bidding comp do u avoid 3n with a combined 26 miltons|pg||
pc|c2|nt|rodal f: 3@H should have costed here. If X for color next X from S=cards and N pass|pg||
nt|xenya: unfortunately 5@D has no play here -- tough luck|pg||
nt|peachy: sure does, thanks so much Mike|pg||
nt|lestergold: 1 trick gifted|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that probably lets it in|pg||
nt|lestergold: lets uin the 8th trick but where is the 9th|pg||
nt|yo_yo: impossible to defend|pg||
nt|rodal f: Can't see more then 8 |pg||
nt|lestergold: not i Kath tell us how it makes|pg||
nt|yo_yo: east will come under pressure|pg||
nt|yo_yo: will be forced to give away a @H trick|pg||
nt|lestergold: cant see a heart trick crated|pg||
nt|lestergold: however defenders must certainly be careful with their discards|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|rmb1: sneaky |pg||
nt|mdgraham: Thanks all.|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: a slow pass gives clear UI, but less so for a slow 3@S|pg||
nt|shevek: the director will let the score stand|pg||
nt|lestergold: east totally guards the hearts|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|rmb1: @H5 now !|pg||
pc|c6|nt|xenya: yes, Franks, 3@HX would have cost 800 it seems |pg||

nt|famus: shud've covered that pips were good--double dummy is makeable|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ady: 3@H  mean  |pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|shevek: so they don't play with screens I gather ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzvx: there is screen|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: declarer still needs ot establish a minor suit|pg||
nt|gambit: 4 trump losers....ouch |pg||
pc|h3|nt|ady: club to king and diamond seems normal|pg||
nt|famus: if E returned a high @h back|pg||
pc|h2|nt|yo_yo: Geller hoping the @C break|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|pg||
pc|s3|nt|nigel_k:  With North and East on the same side and East having an automatic pass the screen doesn't help|pg||
nt|shevek: I don't see the problem if there are screens|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|pc|s7|pg||
nt|peachy: What do you think of W pass?  If 3S showed a monster (Dbl, then bid suit, opposite silent partner) I think West might give a thought to 3NT|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i think 3@S is probably Forcing|pg||
nt|yo_yo: difficult to choose between 4S and 3NT for West|pg||
nt|yo_yo: What happens if E doubles again?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But irrespective of bidding a hesitation will make that only a obvious bid from S can be accepted|pg||

pc|h9|nt|xenya: GAMAX leads by 25 imps at this point. Considering a likely game swing on 45, Royston will have their work cut out for them in the last segment. |pg||

nt|yo_yo: he will surely switch |pg||
nt|peachy: *switch, pardon my repeated typos, I have two fingers in each hand numb :(|pg||
nt|chick: with declarer leading spades back, hard to imagine not switching to a club|pg||
nt|chick: I'm told that the low @S3 was suit pref for clubs|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes, confusious say:  when 2 lead same suit, one wrong|pg||
nt|gambit: nice 10/9@H|pg||
nt|gambit: E spots are skinnier than Twiggy |pg||
pc|h4|nt|roswolf: play should be quick|pg||
nt|peachy: We have a World Champion in the audience, he says it also goes down on spade continuation|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|karesz: Twiggy! Who remembers Twiggy?????????|pg||
pc|s9|nt|rmb1: Can finesse West for @SQ10 and @DQ9 for lots of tricks|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s6|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|rmb1: An  12 was a gain to GAMAX again! When EW bid up to 4@S-1|pg||

nt|yo_yo: now ruff 2@S ?|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d7|pc|dA|nt|ady: north's pipps in spades high|pg||

nt|roswolf: dont think so he will cash an ace and then cash out spades|pg||
nt|panja: he should|pg||
nt|rmb1: the luxury of having two aces to cash to look at dummy|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||

nt|panja: withouth a singleton.. and with AKA..N should not|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|ady: 7@H a make played by west     club ruff available if east plays|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|roswolf: well he has|pg||
nt|rmb1: splinter with stiff ace will not help West value his hand|pg||
nt|rmb1: 4@S is kickback RKCB for @H|pg||
nt|ady: not my cup of tea  1@H from west  15 tricks available in no-trumps here|pg||
nt|rmb1: Gain for Dumbovich on  27 bidding and making 4@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: 1S = 11-15, could be sghir (Precision)|pg||
mb|3H|nt|rmb1: Although North knows South has @D, he can't bid 4@D directly as that may be a forcing relay|pg||
nt|roswolf: now this throws oil on the fire|pg||
nt|rmb1: 5NY showing a void|pg||
nt|rodal f: Belive puppet is on by this type of 1NT opening|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: 2@H here ought to be a 6+ cd suit, so 4@H seems the obvious choice|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: hogs might try 3N, I suppose|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: wd|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: wd|pg||
nt|rodal f: This also can be -1|pg||
nt|karesz: N had @s stopper in the other room....|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|peachy: Nooo, 1D is that|pg||
mb|d|nt|roswolf: wow incroyable|pg||
nt|panja: this will make...|pg||
nt|roswolf: a huge result for n/s|pg||
nt|panja: If W wanted to dbl, he should have doubled first time|pg||
nt|bobh1: this prob shows a partial stopper|pg||
nt|karesz: see this double!|pg||
nt|bobh1: 5@D prob ok also|pg||
nt|sybarra2: scary bid is 3 nt |pg||
nt|bobh1: if they can work out that they have a @S stopper here, I'm impressed|pg||
nt|karesz: Kemény can think this double shows @S ace|pg||
mb|5D|nt|ady: in the OR    west did not open and  north opened 3@S    east doubled and westresponded 4@H passedout|pg||
nt|yo_yo: big loss for Dubovich on 58 when he cashed that A@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|famus: @d lead wud result in the decision on @h guess|pg||
nt|famus: most likely @sj|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: same lead as in other room, fetched the J and A|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: 11HP=max now at S so a push? The @H quest, but odd for a hook.|pg||
mb|p|pc|sA|pc|s3|nt|yo_yo: why use stayman and then ignfor the 4-4 fit, i wonder|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sK|pg||
nt|karesz: a heart now|pg||
nt|gambit: double promised 13 cards, and 3 spades ...or ......|pg||
nt|bobh1: marked i think|pg||
nt|gambit: heart attack for sure|pg||
nt|karesz: N has to find the @C J|pg||
nt|gambit: E probably trying to imagine why his partner doubled|pg||
nt|bobh1: @H could be dangerous also...alternative is a trump|pg||
nt|bobh1: but a @H is the right play|pg||
nt|gambit: looking a dummy's clubs I think E will play a heart|pg||
nt|karesz: w have threw the @s 9 asking @h|pg||
nt|gambit: Or would that be count? (probably not given the auction and the K@S falling) |pg||
nt|bobh1: i agree it is suit preference...tell your pd what he needs to know|pg||
nt|karesz: but for count 8 is enough|pg||
nt|gambit: E needs W to have something in hearts, he knows his value, such as they are limited |pg||
nt|bobh1: presumably he will know the count when declarer's honor falls|pg||
nt|bobh1: so tell him something he doesn't know|pg||
nt|karesz: but North can make always: with the @c finesse or playing for 3rd J|pg||
nt|sybarra2: with udca did that show club?|pg||
nt|gambit: His team has narrowed the gap, down from -46 to -36, he doesn't know that...|pg||
nt|bobh1: or he knows the count from the auction|pg||
pc|c4|nt|gambit: There has to be some common sense, West's card was perhaps lazy, how could he want a club unless E was short? |pg||
nt|bobh1: he is looking at the South hand isn't he?|pg||
nt|gambit: Yes.|pg||
nt|karesz: Bob! Lakatos played the @D A at the first tricks in 4 @s|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cA|nt|rmb1: Surely East should take-out.  If West had a balanced hand he would double 3NT and then 4@D.|pg||
nt|roswolf: agree |pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|gambit: Now, after that long pause, it is clear his switch was hardly automatic, unfortunately |pg||

nt|beno b: unusual combination|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2@S overcall would be better to allow south to judge better though south can bid say 3@H p/c|pg||
mb|2H|nt|beno b: 2@s would show @s+ a minor|pg||
nt|roswolf: bidding artificially can have drawbacks|pg||
nt|jwit: I would bid 3S now as South|pg||
nt|roswolf: ty peter i suspected that but natural overcalls in a major have a lot to commend them|pg||

mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: another overbid imo but typical of the hungarian style|pg||

nt|roswolf: east has been there before|pg||
nt|sundiszno: do you think that hungarian style is overbidding?|pg||
pc|h9|nt|jwit: Yes 3S would have been the killer, as EW can't make 4H|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes |pg||
pc|hA|nt|beno b: esepcially after seeing that EW may not have a game to bid|pg||

nt|peachy: North-South have shown throught the match that they are active bidders|pg||
nt|yo_yo: no that's if they preempt a major|pg||
nt|peachy: This one sure gives E a problem|pg||
nt|chick: I don't ... yes I know the theory that you are preempting 2 opponents and only 1 partner, but with a Hxx in a major, it's going to cost when partner has that major, like here|pg||

mb|2H|nt|roswolf: scheduled restart in 20 mins approx|pg||
nt|peachy: Doing it in second seat with this kind of hand could be hazardous to your score, partner is odds-on to have a good handm there is already one passed opponent....|pg||
nt|yo_yo: in France 4@c = 2suiters red colours  4 @d= 2majors suiters|pg||

mb|p|nt|roswolf: they may have overbid this one|pg||
nt|panja: 4@H..hanging partner for showing support..|pg||
nt|ady: a thin 3NT here  assume  north 2@C shows 5 clubs and a 4 card major    or 1 suited clubs?|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: looks like 4@S must be close to making here|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: although other room went off|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: maybe it's just too high|pg||
nt|shevek: too much work to do?|pg||
mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  Very difficult hand to analyze but I think nine is the limit|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: as expected, 13 imps to GAMAX on 45|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|yo_yo: oh dear South wasnt in on the joke|pg||
nt|daman: this is the last board of this session|pg||
nt|gambit: I fail to see why 3@D should get S excited, it should have slowed him down|pg||
nt|karesz: unlucky game:  single cards opposite kings|pg||
pc|h9|nt|roswolf: @D are 3-3 it is not all over yet|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Worse played by South if they lead a trump|pg||
nt|pjs_ch: with only 2 tricks outside you need to make 8 trumps or set up the hearts|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ady: does not  appear to have much chance|pg||
nt|rmb1: -2|pg||
nt|ralfwil: makeable now|pg||

nt|pjs_ch: that lead actually gives declarer a (welcome) diamond trick|pg||
nt|ralfwil: discard @c|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|yo_yo: I said earlier, you need an understanding partner if you bid like this|pg||
nt|chick: This will be the final nail in the Dumbovich coffin|pg||

pc|d9|pc|dJ|nt|ady: has started well|pg||
nt|shevek: @cK led in OR|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
nt|peachy: South of course doesn't know the running score, he might have tried to get a swing, perhaps he would not have doubled early in the match,|pg||
nt|chick: All I can say Kath is that if I ever have the pleasure of playing with you, I hope you are this understanding a partner :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: errr  not always :)|pg||
nt|peachy: 6D would have been making, neither side found it|pg||
nt|chick: the question is, would they have found 6@D without the preempt?|pg||
nt|sybarra2: thx all have to dash to brunch  see you later today for NEC |pg||
pc|c7|nt|yo_yo: South wants to lead @D   like his partner didnt on the last board|pg||
pc|c3|nt|pjs_ch: I always learned that KQ was given to you to solve the lead problem|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c4|pg||
nt|peachy: So my speculation of why this was doubled, could have resulted in them "running to diamonds and then bidding slam|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cJ|nt|roswolf: but is now|pg||
