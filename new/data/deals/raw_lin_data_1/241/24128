nt|Walddk2: 1@C is mainstream in Denmark with 4-4 in the minors|pg||
nt|pitiful:  many pairs now play double of 1m really just shows interest in Majors not other minor|pg||
pc|d8|nt|pitiful:  why is 1@c mainstream in Denmark Roland|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Because we bid 4-card suits up the line|pg||
nt|pitiful:  also many would play raise to 2@h in this auction just trying to keep opponents out|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Then you won't miss any fit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Walsh is not popular as responses|pg||
nt|runnerup: overbid -perhaps north had too much of  his points in @d -very difficult to eat all those @d|pg||

mb|1S|nt|Walddk2: ARF hates leads from a king|pg||
mb|1N|nt|pitiful:  because he bans you from leading from a kIng|pg||
