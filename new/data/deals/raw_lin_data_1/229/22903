nt|penseur9: well spoted Ralf|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|algraves:  there is something about third hand high these days|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|algraves:  in the pairs I underled ace against suit three times.|pg||
nt|algraves:  the first two were well reasoned but spectactularly unsucessful|pg||

mb|p|pc|d8|pc|d3|nt|algraves:  the third I did catch KJX in dummy with partner having Queen Alas he stuck in the 9 and declarer won the ten,  oh well|pg||
nt|ritong: the point is, when south gives deliberately a @s trick, he has TWO entries left, so @cs won t work out, so he has to play for the misdefence|pg||

nt|ralfwil: once again, be careful with your entries, |pg||
pc|h3|nt|algraves:  two working cards for partner in a " 30 point deck " type hand ( ie opps rate to have two points in hearts and partner is short|pg||
pc|h9|nt|dkkello:  4+1+3+5   - 1   should be ok|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h2|pg||
pc|d7|nt|santyclz: Another close contract.  The @d 7 stands up as a 2nd stop so this looks makeable.|pg||
nt|kemperg: too late for me, 12 and now 13 tricks without finesse|pg||

mb|1C|an|17+ any|nt|runnerup:  3 possible slams makes here|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  The favorable minor suit breaks mean that all sensible slams make. |pg||

mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|henryb:  6N is best: it makes whenever @c behave or when @d behave and the @sQ is onside|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|henryb:  In 6N you start with 2@s, 2@h, 3@d and 2@c = 9|pg||

nt|vugraphzae: West is still in 'the box'|pg||
mb|4C|nt|henryb:  This auction from E is probably a @c slam try|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|nt|henryb:  Many "modernists" would play 4@c by W as "minorwood" eg RKCB with clubs agreed.|pg||

mb|6D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzae: No|pg||
nt|henryb:  6@d is better than 6@c, surprisingly. needs only 3-2 diamonds and no immediate club ruff.|pg||
nt|vugraphzae: East explains that this sequence from her shows slam interest|pg||
pc|h2|nt|henryb:  and spades not 6-2|pg||
pc|h3|nt|runnerup:  on they way to 6 @d ok -looks best 1 ruff 2 @s 2 @h and 5 @d +2 @c can be made without @c behaving -entry problems but all well |pg||
