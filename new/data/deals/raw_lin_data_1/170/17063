mb|p|nt|ritong: they probably have a general agreement that doubling an artificial bid shows the suit|pg||

nt|iceking: so maybe S should not leave in 3nt|pg||

mb|2H|nt|iceking: another option was for S just bid 3nt himself|pg||

mb|3N|nt|iceking: not really N knows pd has some values 3@D wasnt forcing |pg||
mb|d|nt|peachy: ahh, it was alerted, i missed it|pg||
nt|iceking: even its forcing i think N still has to act |pg||
nt|athene: west knows his partner can't possibly have both black suits stopped AND a diamond fit|pg||

nt|iceking: and S bal with 4@S|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|athene: east thinks the @SK is likely a trick in defence to spades so he isn't going to be saccing i would not think|pg||
nt|athene: difficult for helgemo though - he hasn't got anything in the black suits at all - how much defence can his partner have?|pg||
nt|iceking: i cant see any reason Geir should bid here|pg||
nt|athene: maybe you pass on the grounds that 5@D is not going to be cheap|pg||
