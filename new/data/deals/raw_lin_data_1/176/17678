mb|p|mb|1S|nt|pelu: a good board - in bidding (problem with 3@d) and the unic@sueeze position to set up @D7|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Last Lars made a mistake was in 1994, so we'll forgive him|pg||

nt|poohbear: Would you transfer over a direct 3NT overcall Steve?|pg||
nt|robinswr: preempts are designed to give opponents problems|pg||

mb|p|nt|woozle: I prefer (strongly) 2S with this shape and a minimum...I must show the fit at some point|pg||
nt|woozle: With a stronger hand, 2C then 2S is fine|pg||
nt|pelu: yes but when u pass in S u are free to bid more that 1 time|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, but South was stuck as they play 5443|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|hawe45: DK will hope for 1 IMP here|pg||
nt|woozle: With south a passed hand, passing 1S is fine|pg||
nt|woozle: Fagerlund's skewed 3C overcall will strike gold...NS can make 5C (but not 4H)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am asked if they have 15 cards. No, 5443 stands for opening with 5 spades, 4 hearts, 4 diamonds and 3 clubs (only with 4333)|pg||
mb|1D|nt|Walddk2: 16 cards even|pg||
mb|1H|nt|hawe45: You want 500?|pg||
nt|woozle: 800 if you like|pg||
nt|pelu: after 2@S from N he can have 4-4 in major or 3-5 as here - in both cased S can bid 3@H over 2@S wth almost an opening hand|pg||
nt|woozle: h, ruff, c, h ruff, spade to come|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Are E-W on the same wavelength I wonder|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Walddk2: If 3@D is a hand like this, 5@D is silly at these colours|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45: One points out, that 800 is possible. - but one loser in each suit should be all|pg||
nt|woozle: Mortensen needs a beast of a hand to make 5D, and this is a poor vulnerability to bid things you don't intend making|pg||
nt|woozle: Orkoneva's good 4D bid permits Fagerlund to double 5D|pg||
nt|woozle: With two aces, Orkoneva should be happy with this development|pg||
nt|woozle: making 5H or 6C is farfetched|pg||
nt|pelu: can go for 800 - if only 500 Ok with the chance to push NS in 6@cs = -2 / +10|pg||
mb|3C|nt|pelu: see!|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: Orkoneva, who won the auction with his last bid, loses it with this one|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why do you think 5@D was bid? To make?|pg||
mb|3S|nt|hawe45: What a brave 5 @D-bid from Maria...!!!!!|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|hawe45: Will she find the defence...?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Results merchant!!|pg||
nt|woozle: For Mortensen, 5DX is a dreadful position - -500 can be against a failing game. Only the opponents' appalling judgement saved her|pg||
nt|hawe45: Probably this boeard might switch some medals...|pg||
nt|pelu: the problem for S is that he expect a weaker hand and 7 card @C by partner - N should have bid 2@C|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@C?|pg||
nt|pelu: over 1@D|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I will pretend that I did not see that|pg||
nt|woozle: North is at favourable, so expecting seven is absurd. And north did double 5D - and 6C is almost certainly down|pg||
nt|hawe45: @C-lead out of question - so odds are 2-1|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I fear a club|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Leaning back .....|pg||
nt|pelu: what wrong with 2@C over 1@D?|pg||
nt|hawe45: I would lead the @S Queen, asking partner to take the @D Ace (also...)|pg||
nt|woozle: The horrible thing about this board is that somebody will score well for terrible bidding...we just don't know who yet|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That's junior bridge for you, never a dull moment|pg||
nt|pelu: a @D cant cost|pg||
nt|woozle: I'm feeling really old here|pg||
nt|hawe45: The double was a BIG mistak!|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: any assertions about which suit "can't cost" are ridiculous|pg||
nt|Walddk2: phew|pg||
nt|woozle: might be vital to cash two spades, or two hearts, or to cut down ruffs|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|d|nt|woozle: Orkoneva starts with 1NT, a mild underbid with the good controls and good five card suit|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|woozle: Mortensen's best start is the ST, and I think it's suggested by the auction|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, a major after 1NT  3NT|pg||
nt|hawe45: Major-lead anytime from the West-hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: Dummy is unlikely to have a major, but could have a lot of cards in one or both minors|pg||
nt|hawe45: Normally such a lead costs the contract|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|woozle: Mortensen ignores the warning signs and leads a diamond...at least it doesn't directly cost a trick|pg||
nt|pelu: @S9 would be my lead|pg||
nt|woozle: To appreciate the true horror of the lead, notice how bad a club lead would have been...and there's no reason to hope for longer  diamonds than clubs opposite|pg||
nt|Walddk2: As you please, but a spade|pg||

nt|poohbear: what would you do when it goes p p dbl ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfa: Helness asks for the convention card and is now studying it|pg||
