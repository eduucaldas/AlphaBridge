nt|psridhar: interesting deals ,,the French sure have a good program in their dealing m/c :)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|doctorone: Declarer may have figured out though that E held 4@c as he held only 3@h|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: 4@H likely to be reached|pg||
pc|hA|nt|vugraphztt: ur wlc|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|fann4: A flat hand.|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h6|pg||
nt|po-s: Maybe declarer should have guessed (in spite of no cover). West opened 1 diamond, had shown four hearts and 3 spades - If East has four diamonds he might have bid 3 diamonds - or ...|pg||
nt|po-s: not doubled to start with|pg||
nt|ritong: west has no choice, since 2@d would probably show @hs|pg||
nt|psridhar: declarer will lose a trick each to 3 key cards |pg||
pc|dT|pc|dJ|pc|dQ|nt|ady: without a club lead   could make 12 tricks|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|fann4: It's extremely unlikely N would underlead an ace in this position, but what can it cost declarer to try the K?|pg||
nt|psridhar: bd10 Multon managed down 1 for a push|pg||
nt|fann4: 4@S also on bd 11 in the OR.|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hT|pc|h2|pc|hK|pg||
nt|othered1: Anyone for passing 2@C?|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ritong: moi|pg||
pc|s4|nt|hedyg: except Multon went -1 on 1NT while Laffineur went -1 on 4 @S :p|pg||
nt|fann4: so what's the best play here for 1 loser in trumps?|pg||
nt|jkotor: A:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: flip a coin|pg||
nt|psridhar: guessing a finesse is the right play here-2 small singletons vs 2 honors with N , so play of ace is slightly inferior play|pg||
nt|psridhar: issue is only when N has stiff @s|pg||
nt|psridhar: 4 singletons are possible|pg||
nt|psridhar: two small |pg||
nt|jkotor: and 4-0 is only 1 distribution|pg||
nt|psridhar: two honors|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ady: maybe not   can set up spades without using an entry|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|nt|doctorone: me 2|pg||
nt|psridhar: one small card already appeared|pg||

nt|hedyg: these boards !Finally thanks to the Federation Francaise de Bridge for their support, especially to Claude Dadoun  who was instrumental in organising these broadcasts |pg||
nt|hedyg: special thanks to our specs for joining and for your kind and helpful comments,we hope you enjoyed the show|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 1NT  contract for n/s|pg||
nt|hedyg: we will be back in 42 minutes|pg||
nt|jkotor: to avoid guess when 3-1, normal play is A@s first :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|othered1: how  many @S with north?|pg||
nt|Walddk3: 2@S|pg||
nt|psridhar: they have 25 HCP here , but what game can they make? 4@h?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ritong: zero|pg||
nt|hedyg: 12-14 NT|pg||
nt|fann4: The % to make 7 tricks is the same, playing 10 or Q, but you get an extra trick when Kx is onside, so that's the better play.|pg||
nt|jkotor: sorry, i ve somehow seen xx trumps in dummy :)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|hedyg: Roudinesco says play ace|pg||
mb|3C|nt|ritong: bingo|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Passing is a crime|pg||
nt|doctorone: 2@s by N seems enough given his lack of distribution|pg||
nt|othered1: I like 2@S|pg||
mb|3S|nt|psridhar: how about 5@c |pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|fann4: Ace first cannot be correct.|pg||
nt|jkotor: any difference between Q and T? (Q better when N stiff J, T when N stiff K)|pg||
mb|4C|nt|Walddk3: Don't we all want to take the 2 level away from the opponents?|pg||
nt|othered1: West is really conservative here|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|nt|ritong: pham plays weird today  maybe the spotlights are in cause|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Has to guess which suit breaks 3-3 for his 7th trick|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: and misguessed|pg||
nt|hedyg: @cs looked a LOTTTTTTTT better than @d|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: thats a lead director |pg||
nt|psridhar: but unlikely to beat|pg||
pc|s8|nt|hedyg: i was looking at the wrong hand sry, only 6 cards|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|psridhar: W should know that X asked for some lead other than @s|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|doctorone: Would you all pass 2@c as W?|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|hedyg: and @H just looked bad|pg||
nt|psridhar: but perhaps figured out his @d holding is such that a ruff is not going to help|pg||
pc|cT|nt|psridhar: similar lead director X in other room fetched an OT|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c2|nt|Walddk3: Not moi|pg||
nt|othered1: No, since game possbilities are still live|pg||

pc|h5|pc|hA|pc|h8|pc|h7|pg||
nt|Walddk3: But he got one more chance. He could have doubled 2@S|pg||
nt|psridhar: on winning ace E had to tap out a trump from dummy with a @s to stop the OT here|pg||
nt|psridhar: playing a @h is too hopeful|pg||
nt|psridhar: Fantoni had 11 always , now poised to make 12|pg||
nt|hedyg: are you sure of the overtrick?|pg||
nt|hedyg: i'm not|pg||
nt|fann4: But still 1imp to LAFF it seems.|pg||
