nt|yorkbeach:  if someone has a url to a better Meckwell card, please let us have it|pg||
nt|dburn: not sure why - dummy nothing to be ashamed of|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: meckstroth's hair is wet like he took a shower during the extended break between quarters|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  was one table late to finish in the first set?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: and wooldridge is twitching slightly, cards below the table|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: meckstroth's table finished an hour early - and nickell's table finished a few minutes late|pg||

nt|vugraphzfd: rodwell: sorry|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  there was a lot of sorrys on Tuesday night too|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  is this for being slow?|pg||

mb|2H|nt|bobh1: EW can make 3N|pg||
nt|roswolf: hate the opening but it is welland's style|pg||

mb|p|nt|bobh1: in this case it will work well i think|pg||
nt|bobh1: very conservative by bart|pg||
nt|roswolf: he mixes it up as much as he can|pg||
nt|roswolf: perhaps he has seen roy bid before|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Welcome!|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: Hello Everyone|pg||
nt|daman: I wonder what their 2NT range is|pg||
mb|2N|nt|copeyj: good hand for robinson - and my guess is 2@H a control response|pg||
nt|bobh1: i think i would rather bid 3N than 1N|pg||
nt|roswolf: keeping something in reserve often works well|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: will he come out of the bushes?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Operator, W name is Cohler|pg||
nt|tejjyid: this is one tough event|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Hi guys, welcome|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|roswolf: with a good lead east doesnt need any heroics|pg||
nt|marlowepi: as well it should be....preparation for an even tougher one|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@S slef splinter, probably singleton or void|pg||
nt|daman: welcome to the first session of the Round of 8|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|tejjyid: "..auction simplified for your convenience" :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N can be extra bullish since no double over 3D|pg||
nt|daman: the @S 7 lead     most pairs lead 2nd highest from a bad suit|pg||
nt|daman: this auction makes no sense unless a 2NT opener is 21-22|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Nickell says 2N here is 18-19. He must have down graded|pg||
pc|h7|nt|roswolf: 3nt looks the resting place|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hmm, grue method seems too vague to me|pg||
pc|h4|nt|roswolf: :( my first wrong view of the day!?|pg||
nt|copeyj: looks like a puppet stayman auction with N showing 3@s or 4@S or 4@H and south then showing 4@H maybe?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 6@d can be made with 2 finesses of 3|pg||
nt|roswolf: a pass too many |pg||
nt|roswolf: south bid 3@S i think operator|pg||
nt|ralfwil: also 6nt as @c are 3-3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: thus D lead less likely|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hK|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|h3|nt|marlowepi: agree that jumps should show specific handtypes. otherwise they can just be plastic bags over partner';s head....sorry for the gruesome metaphor:)|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  1@d|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: rodwell points at 2@D then waves it off|pg||
mb|2H|nt|kit: Once again, the rush to overcall 1NT rather than bid a 5-card major.  Not my choice.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: "just natural"|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|barnets: optimum contract reached|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  Meckstroth follows the adage that neither side vul is a good time to compete the part score|pg||
nt|fann4: Many pairs play a raise of partner's minor after a 1NT overcall is take out for the majors, but not Meckwell.|pg||
nt|kit: Meckstroth right to compete holding a stiff heart.  It is seldom right to sell out at 2-level with shortness in their suit.|pg||
pc|h7|nt|fann4: tks|pg||
nt|barnets: but 1D could be 2|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  absolutely|pg||
nt|kit: probably because partner hasn't actually bid a minor|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: meckstroth murmurs mm-hmm|pg||
pc|h8|nt|vugraphzfd: out of character|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  better 'uhn'|pg||
nt|fann4: Others play bidding the other minor is the major 2 suiter.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: normally always mumbles thanks in the same muted tone of voice|pg||
nt|barnets: so that does not apply here|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: whether he is pleased or displeased by dummy|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  better than 'uhn' I meant|pg||
nt|dburn: may be grateful not to have bought the dreaded 2=4=2=5 in the dummy - easily possible with a strong club|pg||

nt|fabsayc: hi folks|pg||
mb|d|nt|ralfwil: :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|roswolf: another routine 3nt|pg||
nt|roswolf: no trap pass by west|pg||
mb|d|nt|roswolf: north keeping his powder dry|pg||
nt|bobh1: his first obligation is to show support i think|pg||
nt|marlowepi: excellent hand for transfer advances of overcalls|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfg: Hi |pg||
mb|2H|nt|roswolf: the axe may fall|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E showed a lot of restriant here|pg||
nt|lml: oddly this plays better from south|pg||
mb|2S|nt|roswolf: no way- 1nt?|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: with a combined 28 count?|pg||
nt|copeyj: am sure this must be 3N|pg||
nt|ralfwil: after that bidding, I lead like W - a @h|pg||
nt|copeyj: the operator just having a few teetghing problems Geoff dont worry|pg||
nt|copeyj: looks like N/S play transfers over 1@C|pg||
nt|roswolf: it seems our declarer on 61 made 12 tricks losing 1 imp!|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm n/s might have had a juicy penalty here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: neg X might be a popular choice|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk7: http://usbf.org/docs/vugraphs/USBC2011/Bracket.php?stage=Roundof16  scores after 90 of 120 boards|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Lall in the tank. Thankfully. I could use the time|pg||
nt|fabsayc: single dummy, 4@H and 3nt look roughly equal to me|pg||
nt|tejjyid: it's possible to play Lebensohl type manouevres here, but that 3NT looks like "leave me alone"|pg||
nt|tejjyid: North presumably denied 3cd @H by not support X'ing|pg||
nt|tejjyid: South can easily visulaise something good in @D though AK, A and @D support would make slam at least plausible|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Hopefully this set they play a little faster|pg||
nt|fabsayc: dream on|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Nickell in the tank atm. He has coffee this set!|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: My hands very often looks like easts:)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: surprised by the lack of a -ve type X from East|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he has 4 honour cards and may as well have none|pg||
pc|hA|nt|marlowepi: very friendly lie|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|nt|tejjyid: nice auction|pg||
nt|tejjyid: (if it stops here)|pg||

nt|bobh1: hi|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi ee|pg||
nt|roswolf: ed|pg||
nt|roswolf: ed|pg||
nt|othered1: I wonder if double by south might have been for takeout with convertable values?.|pg||
nt|bobh1: yes i'm sure but he was close to it anyway|pg||
nt|bobh1: can't blame him for passing tho|pg||
nt|roswolf: but 50 imps down n/s need to take their opportunities|pg||
nt|roswolf: also they need to show they cant be pushed around too much|pg||
pc|cK|nt|roswolf: sometimes you need to play the man and not the ball|pg||
nt|othered1: but ifyou expect partner to take it out to say, 5@C, you could be converting a plus into a substantial minus.|pg||
nt|bobh1: if he knew his pd had the @H A he would ov|pg||
nt|bobh1: but they rated to have it|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Cohler is definitely thinking about the @c lead|pg||
nt|tejjyid: NS cashing in their optimism|pg||
pc|c5|nt|Vugraphzfg: And there it is|pg||
nt|tejjyid: well, good bidding meets good defence|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|pg||
pc|cA|nt|roswolf: at least at duplicate it doesnt cost you money!:)|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://usbf.org/docs/vugraphs/USBC2011/Bracket.php?stage=Roundof16  half-time scores in all matches|pg||
nt|fabsayc: dummy is known to have black cards, defense will likely need two club tricks|pg||
nt|tejjyid: East also has to guess :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and 3nt suggested spade king, so a pitch coming in that suit|pg||
pc|c6|nt|roswolf: we are assuming this is being played in 3NT BTW|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cT|pg||
pc|c3|nt|bobh1: also if the @ss were a litlle different double might give them a road map|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|fabsayc: frankly i think east should get it right, if there was ever a case for ace underlead, this is it, and defense has little on no chance if south has club ace|pg||
pc|h4|nt|roswolf: ralf - sorry for the typos:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: is the contract really 1nt,operator?|pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|nt|vugraphzfd: many 1@D openings at this table, first one not to be alerted as 2+|pg||
nt|dburn: not everyone's opening bid - may have to work hard to stay out of 3NT now|pg||
mb|2H!|an|INV+ D raise up to 15 HCP|nt|kit: inverted raise should do it.|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  very good intermediates|pg||
nt|barnets: if you area good guesser 5 minor works|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|yorkbeach:  case for opening 1@c as that is the suit you want led and where you like a fit|pg||
nt|dburn: 4@s probably best, if you are going to guess that well|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: I prefer 1@D -- partner knows that is more likely to be a real suit.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: joel's initial explanation not clear to jeff or to me but he clarified it|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  hard to stop out of game after East opens|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  good point|pg||
nt|dburn: so far, so bad, but maybe there is some science to come|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: hurd still as a statue staring at tray|pg||
nt|dburn: if 2@h was not game-forcing, then presumably 3@d just showed a minimum|pg||
nt|kit: Don't know what 2@H was.  But seems like Hurd should have a way to show his shape, or at least the heart shortness.|pg||
nt|kit: Now they are just guessing.|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  explanation was an inverted @d raise|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|fann4: In the CR (Closed Room) EW have stopped in 3@D after an initial pass by East.|pg||
nt|barnets: good decision|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if you play 2@d as the inverted raise, opener can rebid 3@h to show the short @h|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  not that you would with a dead minimum|pg||
nt|kit: Well, they avoided the notrump trap.  But how does he know his partner doesn't have KQx of hearts or something like that.|pg||
nt|dburn: well, he could do that after 2@h also|pg||
nt|fann4: Well, this can make with some good guessing of the minor suit queens.|pg||
pc|h6|nt|barnets: now we will see how he guesses|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  now we see whether East can guess as well in the play as in the bidding|pg||
pc|h9|nt|dburn: I don't think there was anything particularly scientific about this - Hurd just backed his judgement, and right he was|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  presumably West had some natural NT responses available|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
pc|h4|pc|d7|pc|h8|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  cannot easily pick up 4 @d with N, so logical to play S for the @dQ|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer has to guess both minors right to make this, and little to go on.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: I dont have full details of their system|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|d3|pc|d4|pg||
nt|fann4: The @H ruff helps declarer now to find the @DQ.|pg||
nt|dburn: well, if diamonds are 4-1 he is going to find it uphill going|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  then N for the 1cQ on the theory of split queens :)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  @cQ|pg||
nt|barnets: and then he may go for split qs|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: after their win last night directors asked them for copies of their CC|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d5|pc|d9|pc|d6|pg||
nt|fann4: Halfway there now|pg||
nt|kit: 4-1 diamond split he is down anyway -- nextround of hearts would finish him.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: which, if provided, have not been digitized and put online|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  no rush to play @c|pg||
nt|fann4: Coffin's Queen Locator would help|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: Q in front of J in the minors - or was Crane's rule the other way round?|pg||
nt|kit: he needs to make a spade play also, which from his point of view is another guess.|pg||
nt|barnets: the theory was if the cards had not been shuffled well|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  at lower levels of the game East leads the @cJ and overtakes if South does not cover or fumble|pg||

nt|roswolf: i trust e/w provided n/s with a written defence:)|pg||
nt|copeyj: and XX from Chambers probably seeking clarification from partner|pg||
nt|othered1: Remember the odd 1@C opening.  And EW lead standard J, so it was fully reasonable to play west for J10|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfg: It wouldn't be particularly harmful here though. You just have to know when to make the junior bid :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|ralfwil: I dont´t agree with 3@c either|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: Well I can't disagree with it - I simply don't know what it meant - if it was forcing in @C then it seems a fair description of the hand|pg||

pc|s4|pc|sT|pc|sQ|nt|roswolf: north must think the world is crazy and lets e/w get on withir|pg||

nt|lml: you are going to want to let the opponents play hearts for the max tricks here|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|copeyj: will locate the @CQ I think|pg||
nt|iceking: my grandfather moved to iceland from canada when he was 17 so iam like 1/8th canadian:)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if you came to canada and paid the 25$ exit fee we count you as Canadian|pg||
pc|c7|nt|othered1: When you open by agreement on hands that once would have been considered semi-psyches, your later bidding has to allow for it.|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cT|nt|ralfwil: and 2@h dbl is 500|pg||
nt|copeyj: they were never going to x 2@h though Ralf|pg||
nt|copeyj: who was going to penalise that?|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|roswolf: on 78 3nt made in the other room|pg||
nt|ady: hoping  doubleton honor diamond with west|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ralfwil: there is always an option|pg||
pc|s6|nt|roswolf: most americans play sound weak 2s and therefore  i think declarer will play for the outside strength to be with east who did rdbl|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sA|pg||
nt|daman: better to cash|pg||
nt|iceking: this tourney is such a grind |pg||

nt|Vugraphzfg: But with all the spots it doesn't matter who plays them|pg||

pc|cK|pg||
pc|s9|nt|tejjyid: I think Joe's X says enough for Mike to hit 4@S, in my style anyway |pg||

nt|daman: 3@D +3 at this table    6IMPs to Nickell|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  wonder if Zia is watching|pg||
mb|1D|nt|kit: West was afraid that declarer had worked out where the queen of spades was, but it didn't make sense -- if declarer knew that, he would just have dropped the queen-doubleton|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  'if they dont cover they dont have it' has worked twice |pg||
mb|2C|mb|2H|nt|kit: So the jack of spades shouldn't be from AJx.|pg||
mb|p|nt|fann4: in the OR, same overcall, but E doubled and N is playing 2@Cx, and is in 800 territory.|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|fann4: In fact probably going for 1100 there.|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  and if declarer is taking a backward finesse (with AJ9) covering still does not help|pg||
nt|kit: yes, Hurd might have chosen to make a negative double -- works incredibly well here.|pg||
nt|fann4: So the negative dbl  worked much better, as it turns out.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: hurd yawns.  jeff drinks some water.  eric writes a question|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  do we know how strong 2@h is?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|fann4: Not sure if they play negative free bids here.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: I didn't see it alerted.  so presumably forcing|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: they may play negative free bids -- don't know.|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: presumably Kokish had not managed to persuade his players not to overcall with hands like that|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|vugraphzfd: and presumably strong enough that wooldridge thought 3NT would have better play than 3@H|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  hard to avoid losing 3@c 1@d + 1-2 @s|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c5|nt|dburn: "see what happens - you go for 1100" - "no you don't - you push the opponents into a hopeless 3NT and beat them a couple"|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|dJ|pc|d6|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cT|pc|s4|pc|c4|pg||
nt|fann4: With 3N going a likely 2 down this is going to be a 16 imp swing to NICK and a new leader, running off 27 unanswered imps.|pg||
nt|barnets: the key is whether to X as east|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if declarer reads N for a singleton @s, he might get out for 1 down|pg||
nt|barnets: if 2@H is forcing x and then 2@h shuld be not|pg||
nt|fann4: CR now reduced to 'only' 800|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: eric closes the window and writes a question|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: I can't see around Hurd what the answer was|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|h2|pc|d5|pc|c6|pg||
pc|c9|pc|h7|pc|s7|pc|c7|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: he likes to lean forward with his elbow/forearm on the table|pg||
nt|fann4: So a mere 14imps|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: Rodwell now with his cards on the table.  asks: mind if I see that again?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: but joel does not cooperate|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: meckstroth: we always do that. you can always look at the last trick. that's our policy|pg||
nt|kit: Rodwell should work out the reason his partner doesn't pitch a heart is that his partner is protecting 10xxx|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  a @s would be necessary if West had a heart but not the @sA|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: rodwell asks if 2NT was forcing.  joel said no|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  do we know whether South has encouraged @s?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: I don't know the exact ages of any of these players.  they're not juniors officially anymore|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: yes,I phrased that badly.  NS haven't been juniors for decades though they were champions even then|pg||
nt|kit: Rodwell is afraid his partner will be pseudo-squeezed -- but that shouldn't happen.|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  S threw his lowest @s first, which is encouraging (reverse attitude)|pg||
pc|sT|nt|kit: Once Meckstroth sees that declarer has 5 minor-suit winners, he will know that the only hope is declarer is void in hearts.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: he even threw @S4 clearly with his hand not hovering on top of it!|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: normally he is the worst player in the room at letting me see|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if North does not unblock on @d, declarer has a gambit for down 1|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: sometimes I have to peek into his hand to check|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|nt|vugraphzfd: when there is time, and sometimes I have to guess|pg||
pc|s2|pc|d2|pg||
nt|barnets: new leader in the match|pg||

pc|sQ|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfg: it was. I fixed it|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: battle of part scores here|pg||
nt|copeyj: South will (I guess) bid 2@S showing a fit now?|pg||
nt|copeyj: and W might bid 3@h|pg||
nt|roswolf: maybe but i think the outside values outside the majors were clearly marked with east|pg||
nt|roswolf: surprised no opening by roy as west -he must respect the colors some of the time|pg||
nt|tejjyid: thx, sorry|pg||
nt|lml: 4NT = 2 places to play the hand|pg||
nt|daman: might hard to pass the North hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Might even be 3, it's a general t/o|pg||
nt|lml: here north will convert clubs to diamonds to clarify|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Yeah, the system is lagging. So it's hard getting the right bids in|pg||
nt|iceking: oh didnt see this would happen|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|copeyj: so this pair play XX as 3 cards maybe?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Passel shows a strong sense of rubber bridge pragmatism|pg||
pc|d2|nt|roswolf: an extension of support doubles -interesting idea|pg||
pc|dK|nt|roswolf: did north bid 4@H I DONT THINK SO|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|roswolf: now he sticks his neck out|pg||
nt|bobh1: barts hand is suddenly very prime|pg||
nt|roswolf: east no doubt is required to hold a good hand when he bids like this|pg||
nt|othered1: and he's right to get in -- they make a bunch of @H as cards lie|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i am surprised passell did not use texas transfer, should play better from east|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|nt|bobh1: roy may not be done|pg||
nt|roswolf: now that is self restraint|pg||
nt|bobh1: unless he was barred by the huddle|pg||

pc|s2|nt|roswolf: what does east need to raise a 20 count?|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|roswolf: must have done|pg||
nt|copeyj: 4@h retransfer is not so unlikely|pg||
nt|copeyj: this is a bridge too far I think|pg||
nt|ralfwil: easy on a @h lead, but a @c?|pg||
nt|othered1: Guess almost unfettered aggression cuts both ways|pg||
nt|daman: looks like the same 800|pg||
nt|fabsayc: could be 800|pg||
nt|daman: 5 more IMPs for Nickell on Board 19    double partscore swing|pg||
pc|d4|nt|copeyj: true - can just pitch @C to set up @HK for a pitch|pg||
nt|ralfwil: discard a @c|pg||
nt|roswolf: well as west i wouldnt lead a @H but a trump could be correct - not here though|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes the rdbl on 2@h could have warned W to lead a @h|pg||
nt|roswolf: in the other room north opened 2@S -probably a weak 2 wsuiter and that led to not bidding game|pg||
nt|copeyj: although game not a thing of beauty anyway|pg||
nt|iceking: 4 tricks for north isnt that down 4|pg||
pc|d9|pc|c3|pc|d6|pg||
nt|roswolf: roy welland does like to mix it up but this time it backfired|pg||
nt|tejjyid: thi will be more fun forNS than playing 4@H, anway|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think 5|pg||
nt|iceking: he asked for @H now so will get 2 ruffs east will get one more @D ruff the ace of @S and one @C trick in end 1100|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Katz is thinking about a @s from the looks of it|pg||
nt|iceking: iam sure Nickells @D 4 meant something|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Yup|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Maybe he's thinking about if Nickell signaled a stiff @h or @hK|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Don't think he imagined a void|pg||
pc|h7|nt|copeyj: has to win this in the dummy and draw trumps|pg||

nt|iceking: so good start for Nickell here |pg||
pc|h9|nt|copeyj: AJ@H K@S J@C and Q@D might be an opening bid with some shape (singleton @C)|pg||

nt|barnets: oops|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: Jeff mutters sorry and they move on|pg||
nt|kit: and it all happened -- meckstroth thought his partner had the diamond guard|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzfd: meckstroth shakes his head|pg||
nt|barnets: same leader|pg||
mb|1D!|mb|d|mb|1H|an|!S|nt|kit: He had several inferences to get it right though -- Rodwell should have shifted to a heart from Kx.|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|an|denies 3+ !S|mb|p|nt|dburn: 1@h = spades|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  could Rodwell have shown @h with the way he played the minors?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  suit preference|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|kit: Rodwell had to know Meckstrong had 10xxx of hearts exactly, so if declarer had a stiff heart Rodwell would have shifted to a heart.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: I don't know what he could have shown in their methods but I entered the carding correctly that time|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h5|nt|dburn: the trouble with all of this is that West might lead a low heart and do in the suit for the defence|pg||
nt|dburn: which he did|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hJ|pc|hK|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sK|pc|s4|pc|s9|pg||

nt|vugraphzfd: Joel sets down his hand and leans forward|pg||
pc|c2|nt|yorkbeach:  is the @h8 reverse current count?|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cT|nt|dburn: so while there will not be a new leader, there will be a new non-leader, so to speak|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  East must judge who has the @c8|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  if West has it, no need to try a @h|pg||
nt|kit: how can it hurt East to lead a spade in any event?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: shuffling @H2 and @H7|pg||
pc|h7|nt|kit: Then it is declarer who has a discarding problem|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  West needs the remaining values for his X|pg||

nt|daman: a breathless push|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: a more sedate hand|pg||

nt|iceking: this was really very easy hand to defend |pg||
mb|1D|nt|roswolf: a peaceful 1nt!?|pg||

nt|iceking: he must just have had some blackout|pg||
mb|d|nt|lml: 5@H|pg||
mb|1S|nt|copeyj: looks that way :)|pg||
nt|ady: 6@C   should be reached|pg||
nt|lml: 6@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: pass by Katz denies as little as 3 card @H support|pg||
nt|lml: Nickell doesnt need 3 card support though|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i know but it happens a lot when you have too many good options|pg||
mb|1N|nt|copeyj: favourable lie of cards here - no @S guess to get wrong, @H 3-3|pg||
nt|tejjyid: is a 3@H stopper probe reasonable from East here?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Mahaffey really wants to bid 3nt..|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 3NT sems unilateral - I presume 3@D from West denied a good fit, so you can't run @D tricks|pg||
nt|daman: commonly referred to as a support double    which was invented by Eric Rodwell...who is playing in this match at the other table|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: a double would have shown 3 card support and a raise to 2@H would guarantee 4|pg||
nt|lml: I wonder if 3@H is forcing since it is alerted|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk5: http://usbf.org/docs/vugraphs/USBC2011/Bracket.php?stage=Roundof16  for all scores after 75 boards|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: E says 3@d = I like it.|pg||
nt|tejjyid: well, as unilateral bids go, this one looksto have good chances|pg||
mb|p|pc|cQ|nt|daman: South failed to bid 2@C   made a MP bid of 1NT instead|pg||
pc|cK|nt|tejjyid: presumably 1st round @D control|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i dont think opening 2nt makes slam bidding easier, but of course grue's double does|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: It's forcing, the table confirms|pg||
nt|lml: it seems a reasonable way to play it and keeps some room open to look for better things|pg||
nt|lml: North has an ugly lead.  What would you pick?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: trump|pg||
nt|daman: trump|pg||
pc|cA|nt|tejjyid: 3@D says LIke? Thn East claerly has to go on|pg||
nt|lml: cute|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: 3@s is some kind of wide ranging hand also|pg||
pc|c6|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfg: Alert: Dont want to play it|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 5nt pick a slam|pg||
nt|iceking: low @D return now maybe|pg||
nt|daman: the @C 7 was suit preference|pg||
nt|iceking: pd seldom has stiff @D as N didnt suggest @D|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: the @c7 def doesn't led the low @d return theory|pg||
nt|daman: but a low @D would be cool|pg||
pc|s6|nt|iceking: yes but even so east should think himself what shape pd has|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sK|pc|s4|pg||

mb|1S|nt|barnets: then west would have been ok|pg||
mb|2D|nt|kit: big accident in closed room|pg||
nt|dburn: well, there is one good thing about going down three in a slam - maybe you couldn't make a game|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  indeed|pg||
nt|fann4: In the CR, EW hoisted themselves to 6@S, after a competitive auction, luckily undoubled.|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  Meckwell might manage a X if there is a repeat|pg||
nt|kit: West bid twice on the yarb, and East took him seriously.|pg||

nt|bobh1: a @H slam|pg||
nt|fabsayc: depends what 3@S shows, and 6nt is an alternative|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Lall asking for claim lessons lol|pg||
nt|daman: he cudda ruffed out the ace   like in the OR|pg||
nt|daman: they're not on the same page    same as first session|pg||
mb|1S|nt|roswolf: i think so and in a long event mental fatigue should be avoided|pg||
nt|daman: West will overcall 1NT|pg||
mb|2D|nt|tejjyid: aggressive by Norh, but he has the@Hshortage to encourage him|pg||

nt|daman: geez|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfg: He passed for sure.|pg||
nt|daman: I can never get it right|pg||
nt|iceking: little rusty def here last 2 boards |pg||
nt|iceking: no real harm though both fine results|pg||
mb|2S|nt|roswolf: slam likely to be bid here!?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: 3@s showed a minor|pg||
nt|iceking: 3 options for Nickell here 2@S-3@S-pass|pg||
nt|daman: the defense of 3NT on Board 20 was less than spectacular|pg||
nt|daman: in the OR|pg||
mb|3S|nt|copeyj: 2@S is about 10-13 for N/S|pg||
nt|bobh1: @s lead beats it|pg||
nt|iceking: what should Katz bid here 4@H maybe|pg||
nt|iceking: depends on there agreemeants|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: might bid 4@d|pg||
nt|fabsayc: lead directing for me|pg||
mb|4H|nt|daman: pass was a big reach|pg||
nt|daman: it creates a playing field full of moguls|pg||
nt|iceking: oops are in strong seq so usually bids here from east should be naturalish shape showing, incase pd wants to compete |pg||
nt|iceking: east ofcourse has a incredible strong hand compare to NS bidding|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i dont think you can really tell who is strong to make fine differences in meaning|pg||
mb|5D|nt|roswolf: intermediate  opening - far too strong for a weak 2|pg||
nt|copeyj: nice fit - stiff @D opposite AXXX|pg||
nt|fabsayc: then 4@D to me showed diamonds, has to more we don't know|pg||
nt|lml: I dont think he can because he needs the entry to finesse hearts.  They got a trump lead in the OR|pg||
nt|daman: now he should bid 2@D|pg||
nt|daman: oh no|pg||
mb|5S|nt|ralfwil: and non vul too:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: is S thinking?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Yup|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Knowing how aggressively NS overcall, I'm surprisd Lall can consider a move over 4@S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: south should be celebrating|pg||
nt|marlowepi: just be happy you find spades|pg||
nt|iceking: so now the question is does 4@H set up forcing situation|pg||
nt|fabsayc: for that reason i would have doubled 3@S to confirm strong hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and avoid partner bidding 5|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Nick bid with the yarb again. so maybe 4@h does do so|pg||
nt|iceking: bidding should end here i cant see N dbl this|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to John Gowdy|pg||
nt|daman: Hey John|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Hi|pg||
nt|daman: another Canadian|pg||
mb|p|nt|gowdy: hi |pg||
nt|iceking: with so many@D and no spade spots i doubt he will dbl but he might|pg||
mb|6S|nt|tejjyid: 4@D was alerted as showing @C|pg||
nt|ady: trump lead normally would beat this|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: 4@d showed @cs. Was the alert|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: He was probably tihnking about if N was 6-4 or something|pg||
nt|daman: what is going on?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: George.. You might be jinxing E/W :)|pg||
nt|daman: no jinx|pg||
nt|daman: lol   look at this|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: transfer to something? but why not transfer to @H |pg||
nt|bobh1: bramley adpting roy's opening style now|pg||
nt|fabsayc: ok i missed that obviously, but 6nt is always a possibility|pg||
nt|daman: they were saved|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: well it isnt clear to lead a diamond.  It sounds like West has them wired|pg||
nt|daman: we should expect to see a semblance of normal bridge|pg||
nt|lml: sometimes when you make a strange bid the defence does help out|pg||
nt|lml: because they believe you|pg||
nt|daman: they save you from yourself|pg||
nt|daman: he will x 6|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: it sounded like Nickell had a diamond trap pass|pg||
nt|iceking: he still cant really dbl|pg||
nt|daman: I whack|pg||
nt|iceking: why you dont trust them:)|pg||
nt|daman: no|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|tejjyid: true if N *is 4261, that's nice|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ralfwil: this coiuld be played in one minute|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2@D presumable artoficial gf|pg||
nt|bobh1: i suspect roy will bid the slam|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes and the spade lead will be almost automatic|pg||
nt|bobh1: they have wrongsided it|pg||
nt|roswolf: since east will declare 6@H|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cA|pg||
nt|bobh1: all these transfers sometimes backfire|pg||
nt|daman: my partner overcalled and I have 4 trumps to an honor plus an Ace|pg||
pc|sA|nt|tejjyid: I guess 5NT might leave the grand open as an option as well|pg||
pc|d8|nt|roswolf: far too quick:)|pg||
nt|bobh1: now perhaps doub will not know why he is getting the @S lead he requested|pg||
nt|roswolf: well the spade lead highlighted now|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N overcalled at favorable and was forced to bid over 4HX. way too pushy to move|pg||
pc|s2|nt|roswolf: 90 secs:)|pg||
nt|copeyj: John Matheson points out that West dodged a bullet by not doubling with his dbleton @S and a 13 count|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|iceking: the good news 5@S was never makeing |pg||
nt|iceking: even 4@S probably dont make|pg||
pc|cK|nt|lml: south thinks west has diamonds too|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: If not many @d, at least the KQ|pg||
nt|lml: even KQ10x|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: point is, from S he only cares about the KQ, @hs are good with an entry|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: or even just the K@d|pg||
nt|lml: might switch to a club I guess.  he needs tricks|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: he's probably going to switch to a @c hoping to catch the A with p|pg||

nt|bobh1: i was wrong|pg||
nt|roswolf: well roy got this hand right|pg||
nt|lml: yes|pg||
pc|c2|nt|gowdy: and thats why X works  if 5 goes down |pg||
nt|iceking: 6@Scould easy make here i dont really fault Bathurst|pg||
nt|iceking: lets remember this pair ew are usually sound bidders |pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c9|pc|d3|pg||
nt|tejjyid: right; there's nice, and there's realistic|pg||
nt|lml: West could afford to put in a club middle card|pg||

pc|d4|pc|d9|pg||

pc|h2|pc|hA|pc|h6|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hK|nt|iceking: katz bidding indicates something like 6-5-0-2 shape and Nickells 5@S indicates good fitting Honors|pg||

mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  yes|pg||
nt|kit: I have always felt it makes more sense for the 2@S call to show 6 -- so you don't have to bid them again.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: hurd sits back to let me see rodwell's note (briefly) but not long enough to decipher it|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  North's trumps will provide an entry|pg||
nt|fann4: CR in 4@H 1 off|pg||

nt|vugraphzfd: meckstroth leaves explanations on the pad just long enough for joel to read|pg||

nt|dburn: 3NT would have been OK also, somewhat luckily|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  and with @h 3-3 10 tricks |pg||

nt|vugraphzfd: rodwell confirms that 3@D shows a @S rebid and 3@H is natural|pg||

nt|lml: maybe he did finesse the heart?|pg||
nt|iceking: normal end up in 4@H here|pg||
mb|2S|nt|Vugraphzfg: S tossed the @cK|pg||
nt|lml: okay thanks|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: doubt it Geoff looking at that 2@D call|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this double is effectively a short suit game try, but quite optomistic|pg||
nt|daman: yes   I agree|pg||
mb|4H|nt|roswolf: yes not a thing of beauty|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Double is not a SSGT|pg||
nt|fabsayc: what is it?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Alerted as willing to play 3@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: is it down on @D lead |pg||
nt|fabsayc: run to 10 then|pg||
nt|iceking: makes then|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: am sure this will be passed|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Cohler: I have too much" as dummy comes down|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: well that confirms no 2/1|pg||
nt|iceking: and might do it|pg||
pc|d9|nt|Vugraphzfg: We're about to find out|pg||
nt|iceking: even N doesnt guess this,,, its going to be not that easy defend this|pg||
pc|dA|nt|roswolf: 3@C or 2nt scramble would have been my choices instead of 3@D|pg||
nt|lml: well West couldnt help with a heart lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Dan is asking about leads|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Nickell explains if E has a choice, he should unblock the suit if possible|pg||
nt|lml: this is just an unfriendly hand for north south as the double suggests|pg||
nt|daman: it must be South who is hesitating|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Theyre all thinking|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks doomed|pg||
nt|copeyj: unlikely to make with @DQ offside, @CA offside|pg||
nt|lml: so do you play the double asks for a heart lead in this auction?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|iceking: on board 22 not same tempo in open room,,, bidding ended in 5@D dbled down 1|pg||
pc|sA|nt|roswolf: THIS MAY WELL PLAY QUITE WELL|pg||
nt|ady: again a trump lead best    but does not beat this one|pg||
pc|sK|nt|copeyj: thats one hurdle dealt with|pg||
nt|iceking: Katz should figure this out, i assume Nickell will return @S 8 so he should have @D void|pg||
nt|iceking: he still though needs to guess what other H pd has like if he has Qx in @H not @C king he will need to play for upper-cut|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|copeyj: has chances now|pg||
nt|roswolf: well defence may help of course|pg||
nt|copeyj: just needs to avoid 3 @C losers|pg||
nt|copeyj: 4 @C losers I mean|pg||
nt|copeyj: likely to be a swing to Welland|pg||
nt|copeyj: 3 imps or 7 imps depending on whether he makes or goes down 1|pg||
nt|daman: I do|pg||
nt|iceking: so this is not over by no means|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s7|nt|roswolf: THE @D9 is a very good card|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ralfwil: and well earned.I dont like 1nt on E|pg||
nt|bobh1: yes and it seems that getting to @Cs would be worse|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i still think grue will have a singleton club around 95% of time for his double|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|daman: a command   not a suggestion|pg||
pc|dK|nt|fabsayc: and not 4 diamonds, so in effect both explanations the same|pg||
pc|d3|pc|cT|nt|copeyj: not much choice in 2/1 Ralf|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|copeyj: unless you play 3@D as natural invitational|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cA|nt|lml: they are going to have to cash out|pg||
pc|c9|nt|tejjyid: I'm thinking NOrth covered the @SJ|pg||
nt|lml: well not as long as nickell doesnt take the third club|pg||
nt|daman: he can't make more than 7 tricks|pg||
nt|lml: not yet anyway|pg||
nt|iceking: ok well defended |pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|iceking: really well done give them credit|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s4|pc|c4|pc|h8|pg||
nt|fabsayc: kind of halfway signals but they worked|pg||
pc|c2|nt|daman: yes  very nice|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cJ|pc|h3|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: They claimed 5 after drawing trumps|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: And now all left for a smoke|pg||
nt|tejjyid: such a healthy game :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: smokers do it faster|pg||
nt|ady: going for a coffee|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I guess no-one lights the filters of their cigarettes (under stress) any more|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: they're back, 2 of them anyway|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I have to say that the flavour of a burning Kent filter was particularly nasty|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Seamon is going on about a headache. Hopefully he makes it through the set|pg||

nt|kit: is 4@S really a better contract?  Put the ace of spades in East hand and it would be another story.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: hurd clung to @C7 discard as he was clinging to cards late last night when Bathurst's lead was dwindling|pg||

nt|vugraphzfd: rodwell whispers question.  can't hear hurd's reply|pg||
nt|fann4: That's what I meant.|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  If West had the other black king, 6@d would be much better|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|nt|vugraphzfd: sometimes hard to hear his calls|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  only 2 points in partners suits|pg||
nt|barnets: not sure you cant make 6 @D|pg||
pc|d2|nt|kit: Of course East doesn't have to drive to slam when he gets raised.  He can Q-bid and let West look at his hand.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: meckstroth: "that's all?"|pg||
nt|barnets: If they dont lead the @SA ace that is|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: echoing grue from last set|pg||
nt|barnets: You can ruff a heart draw trumps cash hearts and lead the @S q|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer doesn't have 9 sure tricks, but the club suit will produce.|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfg: Game time|pg||
nt|iceking: we see alll hands looks easy from here, but Katz had some guessing to do it was not all clear |pg||
nt|daman: they are in 4@S on 23 in the OR|pg||
nt|fabsayc: is east hand a 2@C opener|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: another hand of untold promise|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: or any 3-card minor (not 2@s reverse)|pg||
mb|1H|nt|copeyj: not a very exciting hand here - unless they can get 3N played by W and avoid @C lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: i would have opened the north hand|pg||
nt|ady: partial |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Yeah you're right|pg||
nt|daman: only my mother would open 2@C|pg||
mb|1S|nt|roswolf: not likely|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: whoops|pg||
nt|daman: whack|pg||
mb|3D|nt|roswolf: now how will north catch up?|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: transfers over 1@C opener might get you there with E opening 1@C but thats it|pg||
nt|lml: 2@h might have got through|pg||
mb|4D|nt|roswolf: well that left nothing to spare|pg||
nt|daman: it won't now|pg||
nt|lml: he had to start with it|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: in the game now|pg||
nt|ady: could the diamond be short|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: yes|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes|pg||
nt|tejjyid: ifyou compare this to 93,West has just made a very heavy simple raise|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: 2+ limited|pg||
nt|ady: thx|pg||
nt|daman: right|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: They're going to settle for 2@d. Katz doesn't want to start a double war.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: can i have her phone number :)|pg||
mb|4N|nt|roswolf: 4@S ?|pg||
nt|copeyj: 2N probably some kind of relay|pg||
nt|roswolf: well a quick-1|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: As 4@d come down in dummy, Nick says: "That's the good news"|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|nt|roswolf: THIS WILL BE PASSED|pg||
nt|lml: well at least he has 1 dummy entry|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: so|pg||
nt|lml: which will give him a second one later|pg||
nt|lml: sorry I was looking at 3 spade ...senior moment|pg||
nt|lml: what would you do now with the south hand assuming you were not looking at four hands|pg||
nt|lml: I might switch to clubs|pg||
nt|lml: @SK and then clubs?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: He's probably thinking about if he can score his @hQ or not. So I think he's temped to play a trump. Not so much a @c when he sees no dummy entry to play towards hand yet|pg||
nt|lml: hard to play a trump|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: yup|pg||
nt|lml: but maybe|pg||
mb|6D|nt|copeyj: spotlight to robinson|pg||
nt|copeyj: 3@D probably 3@S maximum hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: a heart is possible|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 1@D openings require lots of special understandings in strong club auctions|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: likely to be a game swing to Welland|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|copeyj: who are opening up a bit of a lead|pg||
nt|copeyj: am sure I would have led @H too|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes bad start for robinson |pg||
nt|ralfwil: no!  not for me! leads from 1087x and from J862 is forbidden if there isn´t a very good reason|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: i think they were the primary reason Garozzo abandoned Precision|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: 2@s just says he can't double 1N. They don't seem to have a lot to do this auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: good play|pg||
nt|lml: wow if Katz put up the @SQ which really doesnt cost much he can do very well|pg||
nt|iceking: agressive spot|pg||
nt|daman: I don't think there are 12 tricks|pg||
nt|daman: even if S leads a @H|pg||
nt|daman: lol|pg||
nt|fabsayc: that is the problem with opening 1|pg||
pc|sA|nt|tejjyid: yes, I like to remove all the balanced hands into 1NT - of course that creates other issues|pg||
nt|ady: initial trump lead best|pg||
pc|s5|nt|copeyj: still I believe the Robinson team can bring in the recent Cavendish pairs winners Kit Woolsey and Fred Stewart in the next stanza|pg||
nt|bobh1: i think N was inconsistent in the auction at best|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes and @C is his strongest suit|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: He thought about it, and after the 5 min tank, he probably should have too.|pg||
nt|daman: Nickell    retakes the lead|pg||
nt|iceking: so with trump return now this looks hopeless|pg||
nt|iceking: there have been alot of unclear carding here so far |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Actually. This is the first time they are in the lead this match|pg||
pc|c5|nt|lml: I think he should have the cost is very little|pg||
nt|lml: and the award vrey big|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cJ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|daman: yes   it was a tie earlier|pg||
nt|iceking: ugh zagorin just gave it Katz didnt read it didnt even give it a thought|pg||
nt|gowdy: :) the @C Q may have been a better choice|pg||
nt|daman: I have to leave you now    it's been fun      see you tonight|pg||
nt|iceking: have fun at the hockey match|pg||
nt|iceking: isnt that always the case if Canadian needs to leave in hurry there is some ice hockey going on|pg||
nt|fabsayc: club lead from king was normal so cashing spade ace first i can see why Katz misguessed|pg||
nt|gowdy: could  be curling as well|pg||
nt|fabsayc: only Vancouver team still in stanley cup of hockey|pg||
nt|iceking: Curling is forbidden in iceland actually we have law against that sport|pg||
pc|d4|nt|roswolf: it is often right to fall back on ancient principles|pg||
pc|d7|nt|lml: then its easy for us to say :)|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ady: covering heart not good|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|pc|c7|nt|ralfwil: and 9 easy tricks now. N is squeezed|pg||
nt|copeyj: has 9 top tricks now and will make 2 overtricks I think when @SQ drops doubleton and N is squeezed|pg||
nt|roswolf: the lead will then be up to 40|pg||
nt|gowdy: :)|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: This was much to lose with either the Q or T play. If he guesses right then he has an entry that opps will eventually give him.|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s4|nt|lml: he needs the entry then so he can play hearts .. not sure a late entry is that good|pg||
pc|dK|pc|s9|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: He needed 33@hs i think. the late entry for @cs was just as a good|pg||
nt|fabsayc: they use brooms so is witches sport|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|pc|h3|pc|h5|pg||
nt|lml: if he plays hearts from his hand he has to lose 2 hearts, a club, 2 spades and 2 trump no matter what|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: After this board they need to pick up the pace|pg||

nt|vugraphzfd: nods, moves a card in his hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: folds his hand, says sorry|pg||
nt|kit: Rodwell will probably just lead a low trump, and wait for his partner to get in ad put a trump through, giving declarer only 2more tricks.|pg||

nt|roswolf: is 1nt 12-14?|pg||
nt|bobh1: yes|pg||
nt|gowdy: the key here is if W should have bid 4@D  perhaps game  with 3NT or perhaps even 3 @H  would be better|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: 3N or 4@S for N/S|pg||
nt|iceking: would have been better control of the bidding had ew used gazzilli maybe|pg||

mb|3N|nt|roswolf: a routine bd|pg||
nt|roswolf: then 3nt never in the picture|pg||
nt|othered1: And rather orthodoxly|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: we have some yes's and some no's.  the fear of the yes's is partner will bid and create a minus|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: Les Bart predicts Robinson will bid 4@S courtesy of having no sure entry to the @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: i much prefer a direct 3@C unless that has a special meaning|pg||

nt|lml: I wouldnt bid again but I would think I might be had|pg||
nt|lml: yes :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: if p cant dbl 4@s to show something, you shouldn't bid anything with that hand. N has a very good pass|pg||
nt|iceking: over 1@S i meant|pg||
nt|gowdy: 4@D had slam intentions|pg||
nt|iceking: maybe 5@D would have been better picture bid of W hand|pg||
pc|c9|nt|iceking: or just 3nt give it up|pg||
nt|iceking: problem ofcourse with 5@D as they play, 3@D might have been some fragmeant bid |pg||
nt|iceking: or what do they bid with some monster @H hands i assume 3@D or 3@C|pg||
nt|fabsayc: club lead interesting by Katz, figuring if partner cant bid he has to have openers suit|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: A lot of people would double with W's hand for the blacks|pg||
nt|fabsayc: does not show blacks|pg||

pc|sT|nt|ralfwil: Many players can rebid nt with a singleton in partners major. I don´t like it|pg||

nt|iceking: nothing Katz can do here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Can't blame the man for trying|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Kevin and Katz discuss the hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i know this won't be popular, but i think their should be penalties for a single long pause either in bidding or play|pg||
nt|gowdy: he needs P to have the @d q and @H A and @C a or k 6   thats alot|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: If the table players dont mind, we shouldnt either.|pg||
nt|iceking: he also knows pd had kj @C and AK @H he really cant have much more, so should probably see the hand is over|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: There has been a director call|pg||
nt|fabsayc: you are stealing opponents time when they need to think|pg||

nt|ady: n/s will do well to play 3NT|pg||

nt|fabsayc: actually south can still have 4 clubs as well|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Why don't they work well? if he's 3442 then it doesnt matter. If Grue had 4@h he'd bid 3@h here|pg||
nt|imp_jan: now south knows he can play diamonds after the dbl|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ady: needed a minor suit lead  for this to make|pg||

nt|vugraphzfd: meckstroth leaves the enclosure|pg||

nt|iceking: depends little what 2@S meant|pg||

mb|p|mb|5C!|an|2 keycards no !CQ|nt|vugraphzfd: hesitated with 5@C card|pg||
nt|imp_jan: how to avoid the grand..|pg||
nt|kit: 5@C 2 without queen|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  can North find out about the @hQ?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  Kit is right|pg||
nt|kit: North will not bid grand -- too much handling even if partner has right hand|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  would need perfect cards|pg||
nt|imp_jan: unlikely yes, with so few points|pg||
mb|p|mb|5S|nt|kit: 8 club tricks, 3 heart tricks 1 diamond trick is all for sure even if Rodwell has queen of hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: making a try for it|pg||
mb|p|mb|5N|an|no !HK or !HQ|mb|p|mb|6C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: in addition, and very important, on this sort of hand the small might not be bid at other table.|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  well bid|pg||
nt|imp_jan: wd|pg||
nt|fann4: On bd 28, EW in a good 5@C doubled for -300 likely.|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  the @h8 will help if declarer runs short of tricks on a crossruff|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: hurd still thinking.  cards held at arms length below the table then (uncharacteristically) raised to chest level|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  trump lead often right against a 3-suiter|pg||
nt|kit: declarer has 3 red-suit tricks, so needs 9 trump tricks on the crossruff.  That means 4 ruffs in one hand.  Looks like he can handle it.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: jeff shifts in his seat.  rodwell looks cool, not at all nervous about the contract|pg||
nt|fann4: Trump lead looks so right here.|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|yorkbeach:  interesting choice to lead the J|pg||
nt|fann4: yes|pg||
nt|barnets: good lead but dec will ruff 4 spades in dummy|pg||
nt|kit: I think a silly choice personally|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  has East really led the J?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: yes|pg||
nt|barnets: he does not know that he has an extra heart trick|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: I can usually tell red from black and spots from face cards|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c4|nt|barnets: with the 8 coming good in dummy|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|kit: perhaps he is trying to persuade declarer clubs lie differently from how they are|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|pc|hA|pc|hT|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|pc|c2|pc|s9|pg||
nt|kit: so I take it back -- if opponents in 9-card fit, makes some sense.|pg||
nt|kit: If the 10 of hearts is honest he can draw the last trump and make on power in the heart suit.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: rodwell nods. talking to himself again|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: raised his brow after @HT dropped|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h5|pc|hK|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: looked askance at hurd after playing @HK|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d5|pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dJ|pc|c5|pc|dT|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s7|nt|kit: now he can draw last trump and claim.  Why isn't he?|pg||
pc|c6|pc|s8|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dQ|pc|c7|nt|barnets: miscounted|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  high ruffs now|pg||
mc|12|nt|kit: very strange -- he must have missed a heart spot.|pg||

nt|daman: just a routine push|pg||
nt|daman: 1@S doubled would have been interesting|pg||
nt|iceking: long way to go, its to early play tired bridge now|pg||
mb|1C|nt|tejjyid: maybe more defensible if you play specific 2 suiters, that's true|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: again we see an 11 point special|pg||
nt|daman: this is the penultimate board of this first session|pg||
mb|1H|nt|roswolf: north in the spotlight again|pg||
mb|1S|mb|d!|an|3!h|nt|iceking: slam time but will they get there|pg||
mb|3S|nt|bobh1: and roy will have to restrain himself|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 5@C by south?!|pg||
mb|4C|nt|fabsayc: 4@S wont work, would agree hearts|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: He does one better with 4@c.. They might get there now|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceking: depends a little what dbl means|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Doesn't promise extras|pg||
nt|iceking: if its just normal support dbl N could have 4-3-3-3 hand|pg||
mb|4D|nt|tejjyid: EW will be regretting 109 & 110 right now|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: 2@H?|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes mere mortals may sniff a slam|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: 4@d might be RKCB|pg||
nt|iceking: i doubt they can miss slam now|pg||
nt|iceking: no matter what 4@D means|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Yup, table confirmed. It's rkcb|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Dan is still in the tank tho. He doesn't know to show the @s void or not|pg||
mb|5D|nt|iceking: iam not big fan of rkcb everytime here, imo it takes away alot of natural quebidding seq that could be importand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: agree 110%|pg||
nt|iceking: instead you shoud use turbo when @C are trumps|pg||
nt|iceking: should|pg||
nt|iceking: in my opinion|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: this looks like a not so exciting 4@S unless I have missed something|pg||
nt|roswolf: well 5@D was a decent sac|pg||
nt|copeyj: sure it was 500 against 620|pg||
nt|copeyj: worth finding but not a big deal in scheme of things|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3 imps is manna when you trail by 50|pg||
nt|copeyj: true!|pg||
nt|ady: can get home    but if a spade is led and dducked  defence can switch to a diamond|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: This tank can only help N/S here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: can you explain how that works magnus|pg||
mb|7C|nt|iceking: Italians use Turbo instead of RKCB imyself only use it when @C are trumps, it means in quebidding seq you show even or odd number of aces instead of asking, it starts in 4@S from ...|pg||
nt|iceking: either side |pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: investigating|pg||
nt|tejjyid: although I think they were booked to lose on those at this table becasue of the other table results, but not as much as 25|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i have a feeling we are not stuck on this play|pg||
nt|lml: I have to leave you all now.  Dont get unto too much trouble|pg||
nt|daman: later|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Thank you|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bobh1: just guessing but it seems all of roy's bids are transfers|pg||
nt|roswolf: i wish we knew what this auction meant|pg||
nt|ady: needs to take first trick if either diamond or spade led  to be sure of making   not easy|pg||
nt|daman: this is not as good as 4@S  especially if the defnese finds time to play @Hs|pg||
nt|iceking: this was the danger |pg||
nt|fabsayc: meanwhile bathurst has bid 7 essentially on his own|pg||
nt|iceking: if 4@C is natural nf competive i think N just gambled 2 much here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if you dont have precise rules for void showing, you get into these problems with low level blackwoods|pg||
nt|iceking: if 4@C is natural forcing its maybe calculated risk from north to bid 7|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: There's been another TD call|pg||
nt|fabsayc: that is why i proposed 5@C to start with, huge fit limited hand|pg||
nt|iceking: this table needs more love to manyTD calls here:)|pg||
nt|gowdy:  If5 @D showed 2 with void   he was hoping for more in  @H I guess|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: N and E aren't getting along|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: 5@d was 2 w/ Q. It didn't show a void|pg||
nt|iceking: i dont see any squeeze potential here|pg||
nt|iceking: even W has @S ace and 4@H|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|roswolf: yes that is most likely bob|pg||
nt|bobh1: 6@D by E might have had a shot until doug's double|pg||
nt|gowdy: then 7 is far fetched|pg||
nt|imp_jan: strange lead|pg||
nt|iceking: its 4card ending 4 @H in dummy w just keeps 3@H and @S ace i cant see it|pg||
nt|odysseus69: good evening all|pg||
nt|iceking: so this looks like no play |pg||
nt|imp_jan: why not leading low?|pg||
nt|gowdy: N called  the D on Ralph for taking too much time  gloves are off in my book !|pg||
nt|iceking: agree rather standard lead low trump|pg||
pc|c2|nt|daman: 3NT can be held to 9 tricks on a @H lead I think     having said that.....EW would lose an IMP|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: It can still be held to 9|pg||
nt|daman: yes|pg||
nt|daman: specs   the world knows 3NT can be held to 9 on a low @C back|pg||
nt|daman: North might play the @C King and cross his fingers|pg||
pc|c4|nt|roswolf: 1C-1S=art. GF - a spec informs me|pg||
nt|ady: just been pointed out 9 tricks   assuming of course get clubs right|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|s5|nt|fabsayc: transfer then second suit should be looking for best game not a slam try, apparently cohler thinks otherwise|pg||
pc|s2|nt|daman: maybe North is thinking about the @D suit|pg||
pc|c6|nt|roswolf: the dbls have warned e/w off|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|ady: not in 3NT  the dizzy heights of 6@C|pg||
nt|fabsayc: probably a low spade is safest lead|pg||
nt|tejjyid: it would be nice tobe abale to try forslam and stop in eiterh 4NT or 5@C though - you can see whay Cohler likes his hand|pg||
nt|tejjyid: My feeling is that the jump to6@C has bit twice though|pg||
pc|dA|nt|tejjyid: so, maybe 4@D was the bid that goaded West onwards|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d6|nt|daman: no way|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dJ|pc|c3|pc|d5|pg||
nt|daman: did he do that Dan?|pg||
pc|s6|nt|fabsayc: 4@D ok, 4@S way too much|pg||
pc|s3|pc|c9|pc|s9|pg||
nt|tejjyid: oposite a limited hand (NT opening) perhapsEast has the responsibility to slow things down|pg||
pc|d8|nt|copeyj: So we are coming to our last board|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|c7|nt|Vugraphzfg: He did it|pg||
nt|daman: stole an IMP|pg||

nt|vugraphzfd: last board of the set.  next set begins in 75 minutes|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|kit: The key to playing that sort of hand is:  assume you draw trumps, then score the rest of your trumps separately.  Count those winners, add in your side winners, and that will tell ...|pg||
nt|kit: you what you need to do.|pg||
mb|2H!|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzfd: thanks commentators for your analysis and thanks specs for joining us|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: director pokes his head in, sees we're on the last board and departs|pg||
mb|d|nt|kit: seems like Wooldridge has to bid 3@D and just get to game.|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|kit: hmm -- isn't this a penalty double?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzfd: I don't know.  they both alerted it|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|nt|dburn: not clear this will make|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: hurd audibly calls club|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|kit: safety play of ace of spades bigwinner here, but if king of spades onside it could be big loser.|pg||
nt|dburn: declarer's problem is how to avoid a spade loser, two diamonds and a diamond ruff|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: EW playing 14-16 NT in 1st-2nd and 3rd NV|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s4|pc|s2|pc|sK|pg||
nt|kit: Now, can Rodwell find the killing shift?|pg||
nt|dburn: ace and another spade would lose if South started with @sKxx|pg||
nt|imp_jan: playing for 10 bare..|pg||
nt|kit: far from obvious|pg||
nt|imp_jan: wonder what @S4 was|pg||
nt|fann4: As it happens, a @C continuation also beats it.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: rodwell hands behind his head then folded in front of him then arms crossed|pg||
nt|fann4: Woops, NS in 7@C in the CR on bd 29.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: busy at the table compared to meckstroth or their opponents|pg||
nt|dinos1: with @h honor S cd play higher @s|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed - what with the 4-1 trump break, declarer won't have time to establish diamonds if he draws trump|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|c6|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s3|pc|sA|nt|kit: provided South wins the first round of diamonds|pg||
nt|dburn: and if he doesn't draw trump, he will lose that ruff later rather than sooner|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|kit: and North doesn't discard too many clubs.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: hurd scratches his head and sighs|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d9|pc|d4|pc|dK|pg||
nt|kit: Meckstroth will know what to do now.|pg||
nt|dburn: well, he can play either minor|pg||
nt|fann4: Same thing here, either minor will set 4@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: meckstroth fakes to play a card twice|pg||
pc|c5|nt|dburn: and a club may be a better idea, in case declarer is 3=3=5=2|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  agreed|pg||
pc|s5|nt|fann4: So NICK poised to pick up 16imps on the slam hand.|pg||
pc|c9|pc|h5|pg||
pc|d3|nt|kit: Better not duck this -- if he does, contract will make.|pg||
nt|fann4: Now the defence has to be spot on - @DA and another.|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: rodwell again talking to himself|pg||
nt|kit: a club will work also -- but must grab ace of diamonds|pg||
nt|vugraphzfd: looks at his cards, looks back at dummy|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d8|pc|d2|pg||
nt|fann4: yes, @C fine too.|pg||
pc|cT|nt|kit: I think he will play club|pg||
pc|s7|pc|h8|nt|kit: he doesn't think his partner has a doubleton diamond|pg||

nt|fabsayc: i think they mostly bid this slam because trailing|pg||

mb|2C|nt|roswolf: a sensible decision by north to go quietly|pg||

nt|iceking: i take that back |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: We'll be back at 345pm PST or 645pm EST|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ady: dont like the east opening on flat 11  especially as diamonds not guaranteed|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|iceking: dbl as some forward going hand would be usefull here|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: congratulations to bathurst team, deserving winners|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Last board, thx all. We'll be back tomorrow|pg||
nt|daman: this is very perilous|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|bobh1: adam would have been better off bidding 5@C immediately|pg||
nt|roswolf: agreed but east has a "law2 decision|pg||
nt|daman: whew|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: rehi!  given what EW bid on, he may have thought it was his hand.|pg||
nt|roswolf: "law"|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: I'm not sure what 3@c showed|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Though 4NT = 18-19 NT|pg||
nt|daman: a better auction with 3334      would be 1@C - 2NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: someone forgot to double|pg||
nt|fabsayc: thanks again to our operator anam|pg||
nt|iceking: 3@D would be natural nf here so 3@H probably 2wayish natural or invitational strenght|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ady: seems they have got diamonds |pg||
nt|fabsayc: an extension of the only game try principle|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|tejjyid: trump lead? :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: mahaffey might have bid slam here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: He thought well and good about it but then came to the green card|pg||
nt|fabsayc: diamond ace lead for me|pg||
pc|c3|nt|iceking: so now he just needs to make this |pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|tejjyid: seems more realistic|pg||
nt|tejjyid: or maybe a @S, try & build a 3rd trick|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ady: does opening mean 4+ diamonds?|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|nt|othered1: goiong for 200 against a making 4@H could be a meaningful pick-up|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|iceking: Gib says +1|pg||
nt|fabsayc: spade to ace is actually normal to avoid diamond ruff|pg||
nt|dburn: yes, but GIB would drop the king of spades|pg||
nt|iceking: i would also looking at all hands|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d4|nt|tejjyid: excellent idea -maybe it will catch on :)|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|pg||
nt|dburn: and a spade to the ace is not the best way to avoid losing a diamond ruff - suppose South had three spades to the king|pg||
nt|iceking: we are all genius here looking at all 4 hands:)|pg||
nt|gowdy: Ive got to play with this gib guy  never goes down when he sees all the hands|pg||
nt|dburn: or two spades to the king, and three diamonds|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Ive seen a gib revoke before :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the safety play is not 100%|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dQ|pc|dA|nt|roswolf: bye for now|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Thanks all we'll be back soon|pg||
pc|d7|pg||

pc|d9|pc|d8|pc|s4|pc|d5|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c6|nt|fabsayc: diamond underlead for the set |pg||
nt|daman: he will lose 1 in the wash     push|pg||
pc|c7|nt|daman: see you soon|pg||
nt|dburn: the "safety play" is actually more dangerous than the finesse|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s8|nt|tejjyid: or, maybe it won't - how many down is this?|pg||
nt|ady: a poor result of a part score hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Everyone left again|pg||
nt|tejjyid: that's all I think|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Grue is slightly nervous|pg||
nt|fabsayc: suggesting an alternative bid to 2@D is hard|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Yeah that's it for play |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: We'll be back soon|pg||
nt|tejjyid: thx op|pg||
nt|ady: thx all|pg||
nt|fabsayc: thanks anam, spectators, commentators and organizers|pg||
nt|tejjyid: the alternative to2@D mightbe not opening 1@D on poor balanced 11's|pg||
nt|fabsayc: indeed :))|pg||
nt|tejjyid: however, swimming against the tide|pg||
nt|tejjyid: after 105 boards, a margin of30-od imps realy is pretty tight|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if whales can swim anywhere anytime, why not bridge players|pg||
nt|tejjyid: imagin if every 8 board match you played was decided by 3 imps - you'd have no nervous system left|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I actually gave up opening balanced 11's after 20 years, butthen I gave up altogether soon afterwrds, 'cos I never gotany openign hands..|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I need a new space bar...OK, back soon folks forthe final boards|pg||
pc|sA|nt|tejjyid: nice|pg||

mc|9|nt|Vugraphzfg: thx all|pg||
nt|tejjyid: terrific matc, hope to see you all tomorow|pg||
nt|fabsayc: after the spade ruff, a diamond lead would avoid the uppercut|pg||
nt|fabsayc: gn all|pg||
nt|iceking: thx everyone back in some time|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Ty all|pg||
nt|dburn: "sorry, partner, couldn;t make it - spades were 3-2 onside, most unlucky"|pg||
