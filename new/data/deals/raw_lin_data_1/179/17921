nt|fabsayc: welcome back, 15 boards to go in this marathon|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: in this case it will work well i think|pg||
nt|bobh1: very conservative by bart|pg||
nt|roswolf: he mixes it up as much as he can|pg||
nt|roswolf: perhaps he has seen roy bid before|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|copeyj: good hand for robinson - and my guess is 2@H a control response|pg||
nt|bobh1: i think i would rather bid 3N than 1N|pg||
nt|roswolf: keeping something in reserve often works well|pg||
mb|2H|nt|roswolf: will he come out of the bushes?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Operator, W name is Cohler|pg||

mb|p|mb|3S!|an|Strong hand, no description|nt|roswolf: with a good lead east doesnt need any heroics|pg||
nt|marlowepi: as well it should be....preparation for an even tougher one|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@S slef splinter, probably singleton or void|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|tejjyid: "..auction simplified for your convenience" :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N can be extra bullish since no double over 3D|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: 3nt looks the resting place|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hmm, grue method seems too vague to me|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: :( my first wrong view of the day!?|pg||
nt|copeyj: looks like a puppet stayman auction with N showing 3@s or 4@S or 4@H and south then showing 4@H maybe?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 6@d can be made with 2 finesses of 3|pg||
nt|roswolf: a pass too many |pg||
nt|roswolf: south bid 3@S i think operator|pg||
nt|ralfwil: also 6nt as @c are 3-3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: thus D lead less likely|pg||

mb|p|mb|2H|nt|roswolf: another routine 3nt|pg||
nt|roswolf: no trap pass by west|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: north keeping his powder dry|pg||
nt|bobh1: his first obligation is to show support i think|pg||
nt|marlowepi: excellent hand for transfer advances of overcalls|pg||

mb|p|nt|roswolf: with a combined 28 count?|pg||
nt|copeyj: am sure this must be 3N|pg||
nt|ralfwil: after that bidding, I lead like W - a @h|pg||
nt|copeyj: the operator just having a few teetghing problems Geoff dont worry|pg||
nt|copeyj: looks like N/S play transfers over 1@C|pg||
nt|roswolf: it seems our declarer on 61 made 12 tricks losing 1 imp!|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm n/s might have had a juicy penalty here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: neg X might be a popular choice|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk7: http://usbf.org/docs/vugraphs/USBC2011/Bracket.php?stage=Roundof16  scores after 90 of 120 boards|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Lall in the tank. Thankfully. I could use the time|pg||
nt|fabsayc: single dummy, 4@H and 3nt look roughly equal to me|pg||
nt|tejjyid: it's possible to play Lebensohl type manouevres here, but that 3NT looks like "leave me alone"|pg||
nt|tejjyid: North presumably denied 3cd @H by not support X'ing|pg||
nt|tejjyid: South can easily visulaise something good in @D though AK, A and @D support would make slam at least plausible|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: My hands very often looks like easts:)|pg||

nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Ed Shapiro|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, everyone!|pg||
nt|bobh1: hi|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi ee|pg||
nt|roswolf: ed|pg||
nt|roswolf: ed|pg||
nt|othered1: I wonder if double by south might have been for takeout with convertable values?.|pg||
nt|bobh1: yes i'm sure but he was close to it anyway|pg||
nt|bobh1: can't blame him for passing tho|pg||
nt|roswolf: but 50 imps down n/s need to take their opportunities|pg||
nt|roswolf: also they need to show they cant be pushed around too much|pg||
pc|c4|nt|roswolf: sometimes you need to play the man and not the ball|pg||
nt|othered1: but ifyou expect partner to take it out to say, 5@C, you could be converting a plus into a substantial minus.|pg||
nt|bobh1: if he knew his pd had the @H A he would ov|pg||
nt|bobh1: but they rated to have it|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Cohler is definitely thinking about the @c lead|pg||
nt|tejjyid: NS cashing in their optimism|pg||

nt|tejjyid: well, good bidding meets good defence|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|pg||
pc|d3|nt|roswolf: at least at duplicate it doesnt cost you money!:)|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://usbf.org/docs/vugraphs/USBC2011/Bracket.php?stage=Roundof16  half-time scores in all matches|pg||
nt|fabsayc: dummy is known to have black cards, defense will likely need two club tricks|pg||
nt|tejjyid: East also has to guess :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and 3nt suggested spade king, so a pitch coming in that suit|pg||
pc|d8|nt|roswolf: we are assuming this is being played in 3NT BTW|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d4|pg||
pc|dA|nt|bobh1: also if the @ss were a litlle different double might give them a road map|pg||

pc|h7|nt|fabsayc: frankly i think east should get it right, if there was ever a case for ace underlead, this is it, and defense has little on no chance if south has club ace|pg||
pc|h6|nt|roswolf: ralf - sorry for the typos:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: is the contract really 1nt,operator?|pg||
nt|copeyj: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2009BermudaBowlBrazil/bermudabowl/usa1/robinson-boydrrevision.pdf is the card for N/S|pg||

nt|roswolf: a healthy swing to robinson|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Seamon shakes head after the A@C comes down|pg||
mb|2S|nt|tejjyid: doing enough to maintain doubt in declarer's mind|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: in the other room, the trap pass of 3@D worked|pg||
mb|4S|nt|othered1: Why 1@C?  was he treating it as balanced?|pg||
nt|ady: e/w have a comfprtable 3NT|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|bobh1: not sure why Roy doubled|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: perhaps x is transfer to 1@S|pg||
nt|othered1: to show @S in a transfer style?|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: so here the operator is just putting in the final contract to help us catch up|pg||

nt|copeyj: looks likely that N/S play X of multi as 12-15 bal or strong|pg||
nt|roswolf: i trust e/w provided n/s with a written defence:)|pg||
nt|copeyj: and XX from Chambers probably seeking clarification from partner|pg||
nt|othered1: Remember the odd 1@C opening.  And EW lead standard J, so it was fully reasonable to play west for J10|pg||

mb|p|nt|fabsayc: par here is 4@SD, down 1 or 2|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|roswolf: more probably showing some moderate support for both majors|pg||
nt|copeyj: I have to say - as someone who has been playing against a multi since I first started playing duplicate bridge, I do not understand the status it has in the US - I believe it is ...|pg||
nt|copeyj: outlawed in many events isn't it?|pg||

mb|4C|nt|copeyj: I have no idea what 3@C meant - but it seems like N/S were on the same page which is what matters|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||

mb|4H|nt|bobh1: cannot believe bramley's bidding|pg||

mb|p|nt|ralfwil: I dont´t agree with 3@c either|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: Well I can't disagree with it - I simply don't know what it meant - if it was forcing in @C then it seems a fair description of the hand|pg||
nt|copeyj: it could have been staymanic too|pg||
nt|ralfwil: must find @cQ to make|pg||
nt|roswolf: well it seemed to work ok but the 4-1 trump break is an unwelcome complicatiojn|pg||

mb|p|nt|tejjyid: maybe more defensible if you play specific 2 suiters, that's true|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: again we see an 11 point special|pg||
mb|1N|nt|roswolf: north in the spotlight again|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|bobh1: and roy will have to restrain himself|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|s3|nt|tejjyid: EW will be regretting 109 & 110 right now|pg||
pc|s4|nt|bobh1: 2@H?|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes mere mortals may sniff a slam|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|copeyj: this looks like a not so exciting 4@S unless I have missed something|pg||
nt|roswolf: well 5@D was a decent sac|pg||
nt|copeyj: sure it was 500 against 620|pg||
nt|copeyj: worth finding but not a big deal in scheme of things|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3 imps is manna when you trail by 50|pg||
nt|copeyj: true!|pg||
nt|ady: can get home    but if a spade is led and dducked  defence can switch to a diamond|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: This tank can only help N/S here|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sK|nt|roswolf: investigating|pg||
nt|tejjyid: although I think they were booked to lose on those at this table becasue of the other table results, but not as much as 25|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i have a feeling we are not stuck on this play|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|pg||
nt|bobh1: just guessing but it seems all of roy's bids are transfers|pg||
nt|roswolf: i wish we knew what this auction meant|pg||
nt|ady: needs to take first trick if either diamond or spade led  to be sure of making   not easy|pg||
mc|11|nt|roswolf: yes that is most likely bob|pg||
nt|bobh1: 6@D by E might have had a shot until doug's double|pg||

mb|p|mb|2H!|nt|chorush: they got to 3NT at the other table so its over unless this is a very unusual hand|pg||

mb|d|nt|iceking: none vul nothing can happen|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|vugraphzfd: this hand is interesting on its own independent of the determined match result|pg||
nt|iceking: east hand good enuff for 3@H quebid if they play it as stopper asking,, then pull to 4@C over possible 3nt from pd|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|chorush: that sounds like a reasonable way to bid it|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|iceking: if you play 4minor as micheals 3@H would be the bid here,, at least in my books|pg||
nt|iceking: this east hand really doesnt need much for slam |pg||

mb|p|nt|tejjyid: right, it's not the worst slam youve been in when you are 40 behind|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think they mostly bid this slam because trailing|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: 7-4 shape led both rooms to open 4@H|pg||
nt|copeyj: thanks to you too, Geoffrey|pg||
nt|roswolf: another feisty hand|pg||
mb|2C|nt|Vugraphzfg: Sorry, connection dropped|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Made 5 last hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: a sensible decision by north to go quietly|pg||
nt|bobh1: EW can make 5@H in theory|pg||
mb|2D|nt|bobh1: prob will end in 5@C doubled|pg||
nt|roswolf: support dbl|pg||
nt|roswolf: showing 3 hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: 4@h looks easy, so thanks Geoffrey,Simon and specs. Bye for now:)|pg||
mb|3C|nt|ady: dont like the east opening on flat 11  especially as diamonds not guaranteed|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: congratulations to bathurst team, deserving winners|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Last board, thx all. We'll be back tomorrow|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|bobh1: adam would have been better off bidding 5@C immediately|pg||
nt|roswolf: agreed but east has a "law2 decision|pg||
mb|5C|nt|othered1: rehi!  given what EW bid on, he may have thought it was his hand.|pg||
nt|roswolf: "law"|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: someone forgot to double|pg||
nt|fabsayc: thanks again to our operator anam|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: seems they have got diamonds |pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: trump lead? :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: mahaffey might have bid slam here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: He thought well and good about it but then came to the green card|pg||
nt|fabsayc: diamond ace lead for me|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|nt|tejjyid: seems more realistic|pg||
nt|tejjyid: or maybe a @S, try & build a 3rd trick|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ady: does opening mean 4+ diamonds?|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|sA|nt|othered1: goiong for 200 against a making 4@H could be a meaningful pick-up|pg||

pc|d2|pc|dJ|pc|dK|pc|dT|pg||
nt|tejjyid: or, maybe it won't - how many down is this?|pg||
nt|ady: a poor result of a part score hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Everyone left again|pg||
nt|tejjyid: that's all I think|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Grue is slightly nervous|pg||
nt|fabsayc: suggesting an alternative bid to 2@D is hard|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: Yeah that's it for play |pg||
nt|Vugraphzfg: We'll be back soon|pg||
nt|tejjyid: thx op|pg||
nt|ady: thx all|pg||
nt|fabsayc: thanks anam, spectators, commentators and organizers|pg||
nt|tejjyid: the alternative to2@D mightbe not opening 1@D on poor balanced 11's|pg||
nt|fabsayc: indeed :))|pg||
nt|tejjyid: however, swimming against the tide|pg||
nt|tejjyid: after 105 boards, a margin of30-od imps realy is pretty tight|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if whales can swim anywhere anytime, why not bridge players|pg||
nt|tejjyid: imagin if every 8 board match you played was decided by 3 imps - you'd have no nervous system left|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I actually gave up opening balanced 11's after 20 years, butthen I gave up altogether soon afterwrds, 'cos I never gotany openign hands..|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I need a new space bar...OK, back soon folks forthe final boards|pg||
pc|h5|nt|tejjyid: nice|pg||
mc|10|nt|Vugraphzfg: thx all|pg||
nt|tejjyid: terrific matc, hope to see you all tomorow|pg||
