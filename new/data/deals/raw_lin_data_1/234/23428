mb|1N|nt|bigtrain: 1@S id guess|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: John Hurd's light opening is typical of the aggressive young NS pair|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: i assume he made 2@C on 92?|pg||

nt|3for3: ??|pg||
pc|c2|nt|dburn: "fasten your seat belts - it's going to be a bumpy ride"|pg||
mc|7|nt|bobh1: ok we missed two hands, both slams|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: computer problems sorry|pg||
nt|bobh1: this will go down as declarer can't do anything with his @Ss|pg||
nt|bobh1: a reasonable shot to open 4@C but unfortunately they can't make anything|pg||
nt|3for3: ahhhh|pg||
pg||

nt|petergill: Back on Bd 46 - the maths indicated to play N for @CJ, but N's choice of a @D switch instead of a @C switch was possibly mildly suggestive of N having @CJ (or possibly not, at this ...|pg||
nt|petergill: World Class level of play) |pg||
nt|bigtrain: 16+ any|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: 1@S = 5+@H GF|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: another slam|pg||
nt|athene: 1@C 16+, 1@H is spades or 11-13 balanced|pg||
nt|athene: rodwell will want to go for penalties now|pg||
nt|athene: whether his partner has spades or a balanced hand, defending 2@DX looks quite appetising|pg||
nt|athene: even at this vulnerability|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to David Edwin|pg||
nt|ady: hi all|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1NT = control ask|pg||
pc|s4|nt|bobh1: this one a grand|pg||
nt|bigtrain: hi david|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: alerted|pg||
nt|dburn: and I am informed that Curtis Cheek in the West seat at the other table made exactly the same play|pg||
mc|10|nt|barnets:  not enough only 500 against 650|pg||

qx|c5|st||md|3SAT82H64DAK6CAK86,SK543HAT9853DT53C,SJ96HKQ7D9CQJ9753,SQ7HJ2DQJ8742CT42|sv|n|nt|ady: grand in clubs|pg||
nt|athene: but that is a bit of a forlorn hope if rodwell really has his 16 hcp|pg||
mb|3N|nt|3for3: 3nt here]|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: 1@C = 16+ any|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets:  here 5 major the limit again with clubs lying well|pg||
nt|athene: EW can survive 5@S here although it shouldn't come to that|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves:  1@C strong of course, 2@C positive I presume with long clubs|pg||
nt|athene: maybe 3@H from grue, double from meckstroth|pg||
nt|athene: lots of suggestions for Grue here|pg||
nt|barnets:  should he bid 4@H east may x and west 5@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: sorry lost connect contracr was 4s w making 7|pg||
nt|barnets:  the third in hand opener is quite normal for any of these guys|pg||
nt|athene: making 7? that's a lot|pg||
pc|d2|nt|bobh1: hamman has support but not enough values for a direct raise|pg||
nt|algraves:  forcing NT, one of the hand types is a weak heart raise|pg||
nt|petergill: Al is right that the lack of aces and kings is a negative factor|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1@S = natural GF|pg||
nt|ady: last hand   several kibs suggest east ducks 2nd heart    will give declarer some problem|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D would have been @D & @H    not sure if 1@D also show both|pg||
mc|11|nt|ady: nice trump support|pg||
nt|algraves:  4@D key card in @C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: suspect just @D|pg||
nt|bigtrain: how about france?|pg||
nt|dburn: well, 33% of that|pg||
nt|3for3: spade to queen|pg||
nt|3for3: club hook|pg||
pg||
qx|c6|st||md|4SAKT652HQDAT65C95,S83HKT42DKQ92CK72,SJ94HAJ753DJCJT63,SQ7H986D8743CAQ84|sv|e|nt|bobh1: apparently he made it|pg||
nt|bobh1: not sure exactly how :)|pg||
nt|bobh1: maybe he just claimed and they conceeded|pg||
nt|algraves:  he played a second Club first of course|pg||
nt|algraves:  Always difficult to bid those type of grand slams because you can talk yourself into a conservative position|pg||
nt|ady: part score hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: contract here is 3n by south|pg||
nt|athene: this might go (2@S) X 3@C lebensohl 3@H 3@S 3NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Sabine Auken and Paul Marston recommend that you lead from your four-card suit rather than from the five-bagger. They would have defeated it|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: well if north bid 3@D rather than 3@C actually that is more likely|pg||
nt|ady: part score hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzew: last board here, we ll resume in 30 min for the last set today|pg||
mb|4S|nt|bigtrain: the battle of the mjors coming up|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: n/s may get toohigh|pg||
nt|algraves:  requires partnership trust and \ or personal courage|pg||
nt|algraves:  so the loss on board 49 was 4 imps when Meckwell played 2@H making|pg||
nt|ady: 9 tricks in spades on the lay|pg||
nt|bigtrain: serving nother neb|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: south has a useful hand   decent spades with 2 outside aces|pg||
nt|petergill: On Bd 49 at other table, Jeff Meckstroth overcalled the Precision 1@D with 1@H, as his two small spades and likely (possible) spade lead or switch after short 1@D opener and his ...|pg||
nt|petergill: minimum values opposite passed hand made 1NT unattractive |pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets:  spector gained 10 imps on board 63 when n/s bid game here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=semi-force|pg||
pc|dK|nt|algraves:  They have a way to invite in @S shoiwing 5|pg||
nt|algraves:  so this shows that hand|pg||
nt|algraves:  invitational with @S 5|pg||
nt|3for3: ok, next board for me to misanalyze|pg||
mc|11|nt|barnets:  so the lead now is 65|pg||
pg||
qx|c7|st||md|1SAJ2HK32DAQ74CT74,SK7543HA4DK95CKQ8,SQT9HT8765D863C62,S86HQJ9DJT2CAJ953|sv|b|nt|algraves:  he was able to build the 8 spot in @D sorry |pg||
nt|algraves:  for his 9th trick|pg||
nt|athene: what? didn't he have it made?|pg||
nt|barnets:  west is endplayed hobsons choice|pg||
nt|barnets:  either a diamond for dummy|pg||
nt|ady: now had an end position if west had any doubleton diamond honor|pg||
nt|bigtrain: it s forcing IF not 5332 min|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i remember 1st time  someone used 5NT  Grand Slam Force  and stopped at 6 level   or "Negative" DBL  that actually shows values|pg||
nt|bebechira: da... ar trebui sa facem romanian commentary in this room :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: well...juma-juma|pg||
nt|bebechira: lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: so its both forcing and not forcing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: our game doesn't do a very good job of matching up english with conventions|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: another part score hand    |pg||
nt|ady: 9 tricks for e/w in spades|pg||
nt|barnets:  south pitches his club loser|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 16+ any|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: west will be surprise to find his side in game|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: alerted|pg||
nt|3for3: good slam here|pg||
nt|bebechira: asa ca daca doriti sa comentati in romaneste....please go-ahead :)|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|bobh1: Wooldridge is light but that is the modern style especially with a decent major|pg||
nt|algraves:  yes Peter , very difficult sometimes for our operators to see exactly what happened|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves:  and 9 for NS in @H|pg||
nt|petergill: On Bridgwinners website, about 70% of readers picked Spector to win this match. I was in the minority when I voted for Nickell to win. |pg||
mb|p|nt|gheo1954: inca o dona unde se da lupta pentru partiala. |pg||
pc|d4|nt|bigtrain: this shows about 22-23|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed - may not be so easy to bid, but Hurd and Wooldridge may have the right set of spanners|pg||
mc|9|nt|dburn: sorry, wrenches|pg||
nt|gheo1954: curat pasul|pg||
pg||
qx|c8|st||md|2SAKJ84HADKJ98CAT2,SQ9653H7DT74C7653,ST2HKQT9865DA62CQ,S7HJ432DQ53CKJ984|sv|o|nt|petergill: I'm not sure if this was a mix-up|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: 2@H is intermediate|pg||
mb|1H|nt|algraves:  the big club players these days have developed a keen eye for what auctions make it hard for the opponents to bid accurately|pg||
nt|algraves:  for instance on that hand some standard experts would raise to 2@H to make their game auction easier in case partner has strong hand.|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 1@H ony choice|pg||
nt|ady: part score hand     e/w  might win the auction in hearts|pg||
nt|bigtrain: needs a bit more to bid 2@H|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 2@D is michaels|pg||
nt|dburn: likely flat, because Meckwell have lots of wrenches, but still...|pg||
nt|3for3: featherweight opening by hurd|pg||
nt|3for3: I guess he likes his shape and good spot cards|pg||
nt|dburn: not exactly a Mike Tyson overcall by Hamman either|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2:  Down 2?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Spector has found the 4-1 split  |pg||
nt|3for3: 3@D a fit jump, likely|pg||
nt|3for3: 4@S will be too|pg||
mb|1S|nt|petergill: 2NT showed exactly 3 spades, hence E knew that they had a 5-3 spade fit. I'm not sure how West asks for @HQ|pg||
nt|dburn: 3@d must be something special - can't believe it's just diamonds and clubs; what about hearts?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: i can't see what was written|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|algraves:  playing precision you know partner is limited so game in unlikely unless partner can start jumping aroudn|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C = 16+ unbal  18+ bal,   2@D = game force 5+@D|pg||
nt|athene: nice @S10 makes 3nt very comfortable here|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 97 might be misscored|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: thanks|pg||
nt|3for3: 4nt ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: how about x for the flexibility|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves:  so 1@S muddies the waters a little bit more than 2@H|pg||
nt|petergill: I think with his good 19 count, West intended 5@S as a queen ask, but when it's Hamman who passes 5@S, one tends to think that Hamman is usually right |pg||
nt|algraves:  we are not quite sure what the deeper meaning of the last bid was. but 6@H or 6NT are easy makes so an opportunity for Spector|pg||
nt|algraves:  I bet they are irritated though. That much we know for sure|pg||
nt|barnets: 5@D also ok|pg||
nt|ahollan1: negative DBL by north is much easier IF 1@D=4+@D unbal|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i took care of it :)|pg||
nt|bigtrain: operators don't listen|pg||
nt|bigtrain: really can't|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: rodwell doesn't want jeff to declare..lol|pg||
nt|bebechira: 4 pici au fost optimiste :)|pg||
mb|3D|nt|algraves:  just to finish for board 20 , I suspect that declarer also took the 4th club and then led a diamond to his QT. The defense had no answer to that line|pg||
nt|petergill: EW are splitting up later this year. Hamman will play with Justin Lall in another team and Levin-Weinstein will replace Zia - Hamman in the much-heralded famous Nickell team |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 6@D in the picture   doubt they'll play 3N|pg||
nt|barnets: 3N is not a success n/s|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: favorable|pg||
nt|3for3: doesnt want to chance a pass|pg||

mb|p|nt|algraves:  Grue likes to open NT type hands with NT more so than almost any expert around these days|pg||
nt|ady: should be 11 tricks on the lay|pg||
nt|algraves:  4@H is defined as non constructive |pg||
nt|algraves:  by agreement|pg||
mb|5S|nt|athene: 5@D not that nice on a heart lead is it?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: back to sleep Al|pg||
nt|barnets: just duck it and it will make|pg||
nt|athene: sure but it gives you a guess|pg||
nt|3for3: or 590 on a bad one|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: and might go down in 5 on a bad day|pg||

mb|5N|nt|ahollan1: Rodwell did not have weak 2@D in arsenal    they play 2@D opener = 3-suit short @D|pg||

mb|p|nt|algraves:  North is 3 HCP short of there , albeit loose , standard. but they make a nice stop after the 2NT start|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: best for north to duck 1st heart|pg||
nt|ady: then switch to a club|pg||

nt|vugraphzew: da|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: 3@S cold|pg||

nt|vugraphzgf: Serap Kuranoðlu geçen yýl polonyada düzenlenen Avrupa Açýk bayan Milli Takýmlar þampiyonasýnda birinci olan takýmdaydý|pg||
mb|d|nt|bobh1: is what i meant to say|pg||
nt|petergill: South had a tough bid - Axx in clubs looks poor for 1NT because|pg||
nt|bigtrain: since with 55 or 65 he bids 2@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves:  Cheek hopes that Grue has similiar spades as last hand|pg||
nt|barnets: north would like to x for a spade lead but south may have none|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: S told W he had no idea about XX.. conflicts with N explanation|pg||
nt|bebechira1: it seems we restarted :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzgf: Erol Turan dbl atarken uzun süre düþündü |pg||
nt|vugraphzgf: 4@c neydi diye sordu, Serap Kuranoðlu blokatif olarak alert etti|pg||
mb|5H|nt|algraves:  it is possible that South, after being told the Mecks pass was not penalty decided just to pass and let Rodwell start bidding , sure he would not be passing for penalty|pg||
nt|3for3: which they don't, of course|pg||
mb|d|nt|vugraphzfk: Director was already in room and is discussing situation with Eric|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: with longer clubs North would balance with 1NT, not Dbl|pg||
nt|algraves:  well said|pg||
nt|petergill: Time now to bid 3NT|pg||
nt|algraves:  so on the next round, having limited his hand with 1@D he can suggest max values with a club card|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: not sure, but I think this suit is fractionally the wrong side of the odds to run|pg||
nt|bebechira1: just a reminder : real score is Logos 32 TopBridge 20 :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1:  68  Spector opened weak 2@D  playing 5@D west -- but @C lead|pg||
nt|bigtrain: why can't you beat 3NT?|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ady: will likely be a flat result|pg||
nt|petergill: South has tried to get North to declare 3NT if North has KJ or Qx or J10x or J9x or the like in clubs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: opening lead against Zia's 3N was @S9|pg||
nt|barnets: this  should be down 2 for 5 imps to spector subject to appeal|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|algraves:  so two down|pg||
nt|algraves:  yes it is normal to bid two balanced hands with lots of points to 3NT|pg||
nt|algraves:  occasionally the bridge spirits throw the defenders a bone|pg||
nt|algraves:  exactly|pg||
pc|c2|nt|petergill: Very well bid by NS|pg||
nt|algraves:  excellent bidding to a laydown game|pg||

pc|c6|pg||

nt|petergill: NS won world junior championships 7 to 13 years ago, so would now be in their early 30s|pg||
nt|athene: returning a small spade would keep control of the suit but it is unlikely declarer has a useful pitch later on the @SJ anyway|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  68  5@D did make so  now swing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @SK, @DA, @CJ-K-A, @SJ   now has play for overtricks|pg||
nt|bigtrain: neb @D coming up from meck|pg||
nt|ahollan1: "neb" =  2+@D  10-15 hcp|pg||

nt|gheo1954: asta e gulas|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@D=10-15 hcp, 2+@D  |pg||
nt|ady: 3NT   for e/w best by east|pg||
nt|bebechira: 4 pici |pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|bobh1: another light opener, this time without a 5-card major|pg||
nt|ady: 5@D  on hand 38  down 2 in OR    |pg||
nt|algraves:  at the other table declarer did take a more complex line of play on 38 and this time, the simple line was best|pg||
nt|algraves:  note that Souths entire auction was pointed towards 3NT by his partner|pg||
nt|ahollan1: opening bid structure is identical for both pairs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and comparable agressive approach|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C only one-round-force, right?|pg||
nt|bebechira: o sa liciteze sigur|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ahollan1: not sure if DBL = 4@S or 4/5@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 2@S    invitational it seems|pg||
nt|algraves:  when planning your auction always focus on the likely games|pg||
nt|bigtrain: only NF if 3@C is the rebid|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: They will probably avoid 6@H if they find they lack an ace plus @HQ |pg||
nt|ady: typical flat 11 opening these days|pg||
nt|bebechira: 1 pica|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: Grue has a secret weapon to defenc 3NT   and 3 spades looks difficult|pg||
nt|algraves:  and if possible any positional considerations|pg||
nt|barnets: in 2@HXX defense have to be careful to actually beat it|pg||
nt|dburn: I make it 11/12ths of the 2-2 breaks and 1/4th of the 3-1s, and I am too tired to do that in my head but I believe it to be less than 50%|pg||
pc|h4|nt|bebechira: 2 pici-4 pici ?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: not sure if Meck's RDBL  showing @H honor  or just cards|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: oops..wron game contract..this should be beaten|pg||
nt|3for3: that looks right|pg||
nt|3for3: more effective lead here by hamman|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ahollan1: RDBL = 2@H|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|algraves:  of course he was happy to play partscore if partner did not have extra values|pg||
nt|petergill: Bidding to 6@C is not crazy, but is doomed by the club break|pg||
pc|s5|nt|bobh1: Zia was a bit light for 4@S, but it worked because in induced N to save|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: 28-2 set for Nickell|pg||
nt|gheo1954: banal|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|bobh1: looks like 4@S depended on an inspired @C play|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 11 tricks|pg||
nt|barnets: 4! down 1 on ruff|pg||
nt|barnets: 4@S down on ruff|pg||
nt|algraves:  Yes I think the logic of 4@S is clearly a big diamond fit|pg||
nt|bigtrain: cn tap declarer out also|pg||
nt|bigtrain: can|pg||
nt|algraves:  but South was not on the same page presumably|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: there;s no certainty,, but the odds are good..rodwell can overtake and play d..he should suspect ns diamond fit for 4s jump|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: if clubs are continued, meck can make a similar judgement based on the auction and club shortage in N|pg||
nt|nightbell: +1|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|ady: spector doing well this session   might get more imps here|pg||
nt|barnets: this will likely make just 7 tricks|pg||
nt|bigtrain: roddy could have arranged either partner to play this contrct|pg||
nt|3for3: tho a spade will lead to a quick set far more often....|pg||
pc|h6|nt|petergill: South seems to have bid out his shape. I'm not sure what the bids at the 3 level mean|pg||
pc|h7|nt|bobh1: 10 imps to nickell on the prev board when Kohler didn't cue bid and they stopped at the 2-level|pg||
nt|barnets: in other room west opened 1@H and this made it more difficult|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h9|pg||
nt|algraves:  that is key card in Hearts|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i'll bet he makes 10 tricks|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|vugraphzfk: hurd is thinking about the hand not this trick|pg||
nt|3for3: might be thinking where to win this trick :)|pg||
nt|dburn: meanwhile, they are rattling through the deals here but the other room are no slowcoaches - Meckwell flattened 6@s and won 2 IMPs for playing 5@h where Zia might have beaten 5@d|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: probably should win in hand and lead small spade for maximum possibilities..of course everything works|pg||
nt|dburn: not that 5! had eleven on top exactly|pg||
nt|dburn: sorry, 5@h|pg||
nt|3for3: For those who missed last set, there is a potential appeal that would be worth 11 imps to Spector.  Differing explanations on opposite sides of screen.|pg||
nt|dburn: very tough hand for Hurd at the table - easy for us, but he will be thinking "what can I do if the diamonds don't run? what if West has the @sK?"|pg||
pc|d4|nt|algraves:  I suspect that 3NT was " forward going "|pg||
nt|petergill: so 5@H is two keycards and no queen of @H|pg||
nt|ady: maybe only 9 now|pg||
pc|dK|nt|3for3: doesnt he have 9 sure ones?|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|petergill: so N considers 5@H or 6@C|pg||
nt|barnets: for n/s to bid any diamonds|pg||
nt|3for3: no, i cant count|pg||
nt|dburn: I think only eight, but as I said, I am tired :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzgf: Sonuçlar için http://clubs.vugraph.com/jeofizik/calendar.php|pg||
pc|c6|nt|algraves:  he knows that Zia has a singleton for his bidding|pg||
nt|algraves:  yes many pairs have followed the Italian style of responding after overcalls which involves picking out specific invitational or better type hands so that if the opps pre empt in the overcalled suit, then partner is well placed to compete|pg||
nt|petergill: and chooses well|pg||
nt|algraves:  2 no Q |pg||
nt|petergill: Well bid by NS, I think|pg||

nt|ady: J@C   looked better at trick 2   to protect diamond position|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|algraves:  yes I think the logic was that North had encourged but denied a @S control so 4@C showed a @S control on the side, hence the Key card ask|pg||
nt|algraves:  Note that the math of slams is that you dont want to be in slam off an ace and the Queen of trumps because then it is 50 50 in theory that you make|pg||
nt|algraves:  sometimes it is a little more because you have 9 trumps|pg||
