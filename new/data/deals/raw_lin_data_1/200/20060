nt|benjy: well some might bid 3NT over 2@H, particularly juniors|pg||
nt|sybarra: we seem to be the "speed" table |pg||
nt|benjy: Pass is a very odd choice|pg||
nt|runnerup: very|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  So i think NS have some - in this round (30 %)|pg||
nt|benjy: if partner re-opens with a X what do you bid? 6C|pg||
nt|sybarra: the way the cards sit,  5 @C makes also doesnt it? |pg||
nt|benjy: yes|pg||
nt|nilsland:  when you makes the odd choice you better be right :P|pg||
nt|bgo: seems like thats the end of Fryklund/Hernebrink Chanses for Gold|pg||
nt|sybarra: e/w had a rousing round,  stealing the pots on almost every hand|pg||
nt|runnerup: and south missed 1 trump trick -that makes this a bottom |pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure what the rush was to cash the @H's |pg||
nt|benjy: There wasn't one|pg||
nt|runnerup: he had 3 trump tricks from start but missed 1 off them |pg||
nt|benjy: Come on other pairs, hurry up :)|pg||
nt|benjy: Andreas can you make an announcement for everyone to speed up please?|pg||
nt|runnerup: meanwhile we are waiting--is this a balanced hand -to bid 2nt ?-quite near anyway|pg||
nt|sybarra: which hand? |pg||
nt|sybarra: N? |pg||
nt|runnerup: souths|pg||
nt|benjy: Well you don't usually have 8 playing tricks for a 2NT overcall!|pg||
nt|sybarra: I would just bid 3 @C |pg||
nt|benjy: So personally i prefer 3C|pg||
nt|sybarra: pard can bid 3 @H |pg||
nt|sybarra: asking |pg||
nt|sybarra: and I can bid a happy 3 nt |pg||
nt|runnerup: if you bid 3 !@c partner easyle passes or -this time he has @c support ,but if not|pg||
nt|sybarra: or if pard passes,  I am not that upset playing 3 @C  |pg||
nt|benjy: I don't mind 3NT, partner will pass 3C and 2NT on some hands where game is making|pg||
nt|benjy: Unless you play that as a balanced hand, personally i don't|pg||
nt|sybarra: I just think letting that suit (@C) go unbid is criminal |pg||
nt|sybarra: esp. having the hts over opener|pg||
nt|runnerup: 2nt -partner bids 3 without @c support with some 10 points .but 3 @c he can pass-i dont say 3nt in either case makes ,but if @c  is for 6 tricks ..|pg||
nt|nilsland:  3 N seems to be a fair chance, if partner is a passed hand it should be even better :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: likely ht lead, and you will not fear a ruff |pg||
nt|vugraphzqc: So last 5 boards. NS are leaders with 24 points (top is 18 / board) EW are 6th place|pg||

pc|h4|nt|nilsland:  another 13 tricks|pg||
nt|runnerup: 7=50% here|pg||
nt|sybarra: fantunes type 2 bid |pg||

nt|henryb:  although I suppose on a @d lead, it is a 5 or 7 hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|runnerup: how many times you just bid 7 and look 2/ 3 makes -here only 6 -so this will go -1 --but 6 --ok that makes|pg||
mb|2C|nt|benjy: wow that is some pass as south|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|benjy: incredible to pass that|pg||
mb|3C|an|Clubs + another suit|mb|p|nt|benjy: Is 2@C GF Andreas?|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  yes|pg||
nt|benjy: Then that is a definite 1@C opener for me|pg||
nt|sybarra: we have seen other unusual bids by S |pg||
mb|3D!|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|nilsland:  Pass is not that unusual - why open such hands with 10 hcp?|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|sybarra: ooops zooming past 3 nt |pg||
nt|benjy: a pure 6/4 shape with no rubbish and a great suit|pg||
nt|henryb:  Unless you could open 2@d|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|gronkvist:  No that is weak M|pg||
nt|benjy: I would not dream of passing that, can we do a poll amongst the commentators?|pg||
nt|nilsland:  Beacuse of the good suit you can often come in later|pg||
nt|vugraphzqc: N having a GF hand I would never pass 3N as S|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  I pass in natural sys|pg||
nt|nilsland:  I pass|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  1@D|pg||
nt|sybarra: and playing multi,  you dont have 2 @D available |pg||
nt|henryb:  I consider it marginal; with the @sK instead of the @hK I would open|pg||
nt|nidhoegg1:  I could open on souths hand, but I would not open 2c on norths hand|pg||
nt|runnerup: who bids 6 now -how about @s -not so easy|pg||
nt|bgo: i open|pg||
nt|granguru:  7@S?|pg||
nt|vugraphzqc: oh opening bid :)  I open 1@d too|pg||
nt|sybarra: hi Roland :) |pg||
nt|benjy: I would need a gun to my head to pass the south cards|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|Walddk2:  Hi|pg||
nt|sybarra: we have had lots of fun here! |pg||
nt|henryb:  I take it France is running late?|pg||
nt|sybarra: this maybe last playable spot?|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Youngsters arealways fun to watch|pg||
nt|benjy: I agree one might come in later but it's not always so easy if the opponents pre-empt|pg||
nt|runnerup: so we found 3 times on 7-level and all makes-in a row|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|henryb:  6@d is cold, and reasonable|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  N opens normally in 1 C with this hand. |pg||
nt|sybarra: we have seen some misunderstandings,  great plays, some not so great plays etc |pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|nt|thesai:  hello all, NS are they twin?:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzqc: where will this end?|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  But he will not to miss another slam :)|pg||
mb|6N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|henryb:  cold as the cards lie, reasonable to bid|pg||
nt|runnerup: this is ok|pg||
nt|benjy: I bet north doesn't think this is making!|pg||
nt|nilsland:  should be played from North but will make anywaly|pg||
nt|henryb:  this is a little trickier, especially if W leads a @h|pg||
nt|vugraphzqc: North took 4@d as cue with @h supp.  3@d I couldn't hear because of stupid train going bye|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  A @h lead  now is thrilling|pg||
nt|runnerup: just take ace and @s away -makes|pg||
nt|vugraphzqc: leader has 3@h taken out|pg||
nt|benjy: Surely he will lead a @S no?|pg||
nt|vugraphzqc: but shifted to spade|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sybarra: "thrilling"  maybe gives S a heart attack  |pg||
nt|nidhoegg1:  it would seem odd if w found a heart lead|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s4|pc|s5|pg||
nt|vugraphzqc: well he picked it out first...  then he started thinking :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: this what you call "all in" |pg||
nt|benjy: hehe|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d3|nt|nidhoegg1:  unlucky =)|pg||
nt|nilsland:  It worked out well to pass the south hand :) If you open you have to hold back later :)|pg||

mc|12|nt|sybarra: bet that is top or near top |pg||
nt|vugraphzqc: so last board coming up, I'll keep the room open for a while after tho|pg||
nt|gronkvist:  So a good tips to a junior boy is to find a good girl to play this tournament if he wants to win.|pg||
