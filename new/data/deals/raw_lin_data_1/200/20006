nt|psyck: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|bobholl: easy 4@H to start with |pg||
nt|othered1: A routine strong NT auction, perhaps, but today 4th seat 1N openers are relatively rare,  as someone finds a reason to open in front of them|pg||
nt|bobholl: p p p  1nt  p 2@D superaccept 4@H|pg||

nt|marlowepi: welcome back all|pg||
nt|marlowepi: @H|pg||

nt|vugraphzcp: welcome all|pg||
pc|h2|nt|psyck: wonder what 2N was for them|pg||
nt|psyck: apparently a raise of some kind looking at the 4@s rebid|pg||
pc|hK|nt|othered1: Can west be t hinking?  Partner was a passed hand|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cK|pc|c8|nt|othered1: this will be a very routine 5.|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d6|nt|psyck: going for some xruff maybe|pg||
nt|psyck: that may not work well if he loses 2@s, 1@h, 1@d|pg||
nt|psyck: as cards are, his best chance would be to get @d fin right|pg||
nt|marlowepi: looks to be a dull 3N|pg||
nt|bobholl: simple 3 nt with 9 (or 10) tricks|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d7|pg||
nt|danilo1: 8 topp tricks ... but guess any lead by West will find ninth one (difficult to immagine @C lead)|pg||

nt|bobholl: nice 4@h|pg||
nt|bobholl: but not made (yet)|pg||
nt|psyck: not a great game with only 1 entry to dummy & not enough tricks|pg||
nt|bobholl: j@H now is best|pg||
nt|psyck: would often go down even with @h fin on, & no chance here|pg||

nt|vugraphznq: all players agreed it was a good lead:)|pg||
nt|granguru:  vul W should bid 3@H|pg||
nt|psyck: apparently he did try the x ruff & went down as suspected|pg||
nt|bobholl: 6@D on 6@H good save|pg||
nt|bobholl: and a likely push|pg||
nt|a_a_a_a_a: hi|pg||
nt|othered1: Lots of room for differing actions on this  hand, beginning with east's possible opening bid|pg||
nt|marlowepi: lots of options for the auction here|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: welcome all|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|zebutin: mighty try even 7@D|pg||
nt|othered1: anyone know their 1N range?|pg||
mb|1C|an|polish !C|nt|skjaeran:  Agree|pg||
nt|granguru:  over 1@C|pg||
nt|psyck: the correct side will start bidding @d soon :)|pg||
nt|othered1: Looks like their  headed to a @S fit|pg||
mb|1S|nt|zebutin: just 5@D for 4nt?|pg||
nt|psyck: 4N better|pg||
nt|zebutin: can't bid 4nt over 4nt...but maybe would tell hand better...|pg||
mb|p|nt|danilo1: if West decides for 3@H ... not easy life in North|pg||
nt|granguru:  2@h is the conservative approach|pg||
nt|psyck: looks all canape style|pg||
mb|2S|nt|bobholl: both sides have to be carefull not coming too high|pg||
nt|othered1: Left to their own devices  here, these are non-trivialNS  hands to bid without interference.|pg||
nt|bobholl: west could bid 2nt min ors now :) but would do that only in pairs :)|pg||
nt|othered1: Assumihng the hand doesn't pass out, possible if east doesn't choose to open the flat aceless 12|pg||
mb|p|nt|skjaeran:  Rasmussen is a little more cautious.|pg||
nt|bobholl: s doesn't know the strength of N|pg||
nt|bobholl: at this vulnarabilty and playing 12-14 most would i guess|pg||
nt|othered1: I guess they must play this double for takeout.|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: maybe W should just bid 3N looking at the misfits|pg||
nt|psyck: EW play Strong @c with Canape (including responders bids) I'm told|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|zebutin: 6@D seems little stretched for me|pg||
nt|othered1: Possible for Luxembourg to play @D in both rooms|pg||
mb|3C|nt|granguru:  North had it easy|pg||
nt|psyck:  well 2@h still gets them a plus|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: welcome all|pg||

nt|vugraphzcp: Running Scores http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11SanMarino/minirama.html|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru:  A new Moysean fit at work|pg||
nt|bobholl: one should discuss if pass is Forcing in this case |pg||
nt|othered1: west took that as natural, a good move as cards lie|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|d3|nt|psyck:  sry, i was wrong|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  Looks like 4@s is making to me|pg||
nt|psyck:  yes, i thought it had def, guess not|pg||
nt|granguru:  y as @s are 3-3 @C and @C forces to play @S10 and rely on a good @s dsitribution|pg||
nt|granguru:  a @D return is out of the question|pg||
nt|psyck:  even @h lead does not defest 4@s|pg||
nt|granguru:  a @H looks better. declarer plays @SK and a @c himself |pg||
nt|psyck: S knows his minor cards are golden|pg||
pc|d4|nt|danilo1: thk will guess @SJ ... even if defense starts with 3 rounds of @C (since East did not bid 3@H - having @CAK, declarer will probably read 7-card @H in West)|pg||
nt|psyck: 5@c -1 on trump lead|pg||
nt|zebutin: yes, Kxxxx and Q in @C must be good cards for partner|pg||
nt|bobholl: west takes no risk (@H could be 11) but not to probable after 7@D :)|pg||
pc|dT|nt|granguru:  making the same play|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  Another @h and a @c ruff, going down.|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|nt|skjaeran:  Def keep a high club.|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|psyck: lead was easy on the bidding|pg||
nt|psyck: NV, may as well go down in 6 than in 5 :)|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|h6|nt|psyck:  ...i did not realize the strength of the @d suit, so thought @h lead would beat 4@s|pg||
nt|granguru:  well e knows @s are 3-3 so he tries to promote a @s trick for himself|pg||
nt|granguru:  @s10 permits to win all @s|pg||
nt|bobholl: wow not best defence|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h5|pc|h8|nt|granguru:  I explained myself wrongly before sorry|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|danilo1: so .. declarer should now read 7-card @H in West+ @DA |pg||
nt|othered1: best defense likely would have started by south leading the long suit |pg||
pc|d6|pc|d2|pc|dA|pg||
pc|s3|nt|granguru:  claim time already|pg||
pc|s5|nt|marlowepi: not sure about this line, as opposed to setting up a diamond, but with right view in hearts D wont be needed|pg||

pc|cK|pc|s7|pg||

nt|Walddk2: We are in San Marino, one of the smallest countries in the world|pg||
nt|henryb:  Hi Ed, Bob|pg||
nt|othered1: North has a  hand that big @C systems handle quite well.|pg||
nt|bobholl: very good 7@H and biddable if S can show his singleton @C|pg||
nt|othered1: HI, Henry!|pg||
nt|bobholl: think any reasanoble line will let 4@S make|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru:  a small @c first improuves a little defense options|pg||
nt|Walddk2: San Marino is a state situated on the Italian peninsula on the eastern side of the Apennine Mountains. It is an enclave surrounded by Italy. Its size is just over 61 km2 (24 sq mi) ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: with an estimated population of over 30,000. Its capital is the City of San Marino. San Marino has the smallest population of all the members of the Council of Europe|pg||

mb|1D|nt|bobholl: raptor would be pretty to have in W |pg||

nt|bobholl: sry N :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Not quite a 2@C bid, because  you run out of rebids pretty quickly|pg||
nt|phil: yes, declarer gets a good count on the hand when the 3rd diamond is played. I do think its stronger for North to duck that heart though, don;t you think? |pg||
mb|1H|nt|sunsamvar: BRAVE 1 NT BY e|pg||
nt|psyck: http://td.bboitalia.it/sanmarino/|pg||
nt|bobholl: yes but it will make nevertheless|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: P cud be yarborough|pg||
mb|2D|nt|psyck: some like sandwich NT (for other suits) & some like nat NT (since opps often open & respond light & steal you blind)...|pg||
nt|othered1: 7 is an excellent spot and may be biddable.  |pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|granguru:  as W may open the @h suit..but still the hand cant be beaten after a @c lead|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  Not sure if x show2 4 or 4+ @s|pg||
nt|psyck: Roland has the 'R' convention closely trailing the F & G conventions in the list of avoidable ones|pg||
nt|bobholl: 1nt x on a @S  lead :) wouldn't have found that :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: @S guess solved now so will make|pg||
nt|phil: me neither :)|pg||
nt|phil: but even on a heart, there arent a lot of tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|sunsamvar: 2@S transfer and 2nt acceptance|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sunsamvar: true CK but still a brave bid at unfav vul :)|pg||
nt|psyck: playing NT as nat in that position, I would also bid 1NT|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi all, sorry i am late:):(|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S had not an obvious pass for some of us|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sometimes a 53 major suit fit is not the key to the city. here 5C is a much more comfortable spot|pg||
nt|marlowepi: double dummy it looks like W can get home, but there is work to be done|pg||
nt|marlowepi: as the cards lie, even 6C is more comfortable than 4S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W has every reason to think long and carefully here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: though soon we may start wondering if the screen door has been raised:)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mathat: 3 @c is the best cont for N S loose 2 @c 1 @s and 1@d|pg||
nt|bobholl: on their way to 7 i guess|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cJ|pg||

pc|dK|nt|skjaeran:  Opposite for me|pg||
nt|granguru:  modern bidding abnadoned the x meaning 4@s|pg||
nt|granguru:  now the main purpose is to force the overcaller to lead at any cost|pg||
nt|danilo1: I like this way ... 1@S 5+ has advantages|pg||
nt|othered1: This would be a v ery easy Blue Team Club auction, where south would show an ace and a king on his first response, then @H fit, then cue-bidding should focus on t he value of the ...|pg||
nt|othered1: @SQ|pg||
pc|d2|nt|skjaeran:  Anyway, I'd rebid 2@s with the west hand.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|othered1: 5@S-7@H?|pg||
nt|bobholl: de wijs muller would reach this surely with their tarzan precision|pg||
nt|othered1: I like the 5@H bid|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|d5|nt|psyck: too big a hand, & opps could be very light NV, even if it is a poor spot, opps may not always be able to pen you...also if I don't intend to bid 1N here, may as well switch to ...|pg||
nt|psyck: sandwich NT than Nat|pg||
nt|othered1: In an a uction like this, where one hand is much stronger than the other,  I submit 5@H is a showing bid, n ot an asking bid about anything.|pg||
nt|henryb:  It would be even easier for any relay-based method where North would discover that South was 5-4-2-2 with 6 "A-K-Q" points, a high spade (A, K or Q) a high heart and a high club. |pg||
pc|s3|pc|d4|nt|othered1: Sure, relays handle hands like this trivially|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|s2|nt|granguru:  so x means 4+ @s normally and 1@s is art no major|pg||
nt|psyck:  yes, 1@s should deny 4 carder if x shows 4|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: was it better for south to duck the @C sacrificing a trick but killing the suit|pg||
nt|othered1: wonder what 5N is supposed to say?|pg||
pc|s6|nt|granguru:  yes 1@s is still standard...young people are changing it|pg||
nt|bobholl: if s still interested N has an easy 7 @H bid|pg||
nt|othered1: well done..|pg||
nt|henryb:  Whatever the bids meant, well done!|pg||
nt|othered1: I must leave for a while,  Bye for now.|pg||
nt|bobholl: well bid and play will present no problem with @S 32|pg||

pc|c6|pc|c5|pc|cQ|pc|cT|pg||
nt|granguru:  using all kind of transfers at the one level in order to force overcaller to lead as much as possible|pg||

nt|danilo1: did it really happen?|pg||

nt|bobholl: make your choice 1 2 3 4 @H or 1@S :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes, white on white...a little unusual but 11 card fits can do that|pg||
mb|3D|nt|bobholl: this is cheaper :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: yes, 1@h double a good idea at the vul & with passed hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the real criterion in such decisions is: if we do push the opps to 5H, are they likely to go down? if not, less attractoive to save, esp with 2 likely defensiove tricks|pg||
nt|andyv:  I wonder how many pairs have 4@h to play in this situation|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sorry, i said that inside it:):(|pg||
mb|3N|nt|zebutin: yes...i must admit i couldn't have passed with Wests hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bobholl: 5@H is cheap |pg||

nt|phil: 1 looks sort of obvious to me even if you play wide ranging preempts|pg||
nt|bobholl: 6@H goes for 800 so better pass :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not sure about that D by N. maybe 4H is better, planning to correct spades to NT for minors|pg||
nt|phil: with a void heart, its unlikely the w/r opponents are bidding 4@h, so maybe the mild overbid of 4N is best? |pg||

pc|s9|nt|psyck:  4@h could make even if you get trumps wrong|pg||
nt|bobholl: only objection against double is only 3 @S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i like any plan that strongly emphasizes the minors, as pd is likely to have a fit. i think the double was based on the fear that S had 18 balanced and that 3N was the only game. ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: narrow target to try to hit|pg||

nt|marlowepi: but club toward dummy is an extra chance at no cost|pg||
nt|andyv:  seems to be the normal thing to do|pg||
nt|marlowepi: should be a big pickup as EW make 4S|pg||
nt|frangos007:  another very interesting hand|pg||
nt|ugis: hello everyone|pg||
mb|1N|nt|psyck: NS will go down in some contract here i suppose|pg||
nt|andyv:  unless you have 2 timid rabbits sitting E|pg||

mb|p|nt|bobholl: 6@H in east is the optimum contract :)|pg||
nt|blewah: both pairs play big club|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3Dmaking is likely outcome|pg||
nt|frangos007:  the trick is to stay only in 4@S|pg||
nt|ugis: Estonia has taken an early lead here|pg||
mb|2S|nt|psyck: luckily not possible to misguess @s|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2C ?|pg||

mb|d|nt|chrisky: 6NT also....|pg||
nt|blewah: exclusion rkcb now?|pg||
nt|bobholl: 4@D voidwood would be pretty now |pg||
nt|blewah: 5@d|pg||
nt|blewah: or yes 4@d, depending on their agreement|pg||
nt|bobholl: why 1 @S 3rd hand a multi or weak two looks better|pg||
mb|3C|nt|marlowepi: 1H ? why not X ?|pg||
nt|andyv:  not my call but might find the 4-4 fit for whatever value it has here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: unless that shows 64 in S/H respectively, it seems eccentric|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: 4@H no aces and the optimum contract in the best hand :)|pg||

nt|bobholl: now double in N ?|pg||
nt|bobholl: don't understand either|pg||
nt|andyv:  contract, however, is normal enough|pg||
nt|frangos007:  4NT is for the minors, which after the takeout double usually promising 4@H, shows a void in spades|pg||
nt|ugis: probably N could have bid smth over 3c..|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|nt|bobholl: and s 3@S now ?|pg||
nt|frangos007:  N might double this, expecting strength from partner|pg||

pc|s8|pg||
nt|bobholl: i would feel prettier as W after 4 or 5@D but may be that's save atracting |pg||
pc|h9|nt|bobholl: me and my partner would have done not that good on this one 1nt 2@C and than 4@H :)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|zebutin: for some 3@H over 2@D might tell solid suit/wants to play in @H and asking for cue bids|pg||
nt|blewah: maybe W should've bid 3@h but he probably wanted to show support in @s 1st|pg||
nt|bobholl: has he shown this much playing strength ?|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, jumps in GF auctions should show solid suit (they were in GF after 1@s i think)|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hT|pg||
nt|bobholl: may be i direct 4/5 @D would agree @S :(|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|blewah: yes, that would be the intention too|pg||
nt|frangos007:  going for the possible overtrick?|pg||
nt|frangos007:  trying to discard losing club if @HA is with North, perhaps|pg||
nt|frangos007:  i think the bidding makes clear the @SK is with N and he should have tackled trumps immediately|pg||
nt|frangos007:  it's all down to getting the trumps right|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ugis: only diamond ruffs beat 4 spades|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|blewah: W just wanted to knoe keycards in @s excluding in @d|pg||
nt|frangos007:  this might help declarer now to make +1|pg||
pc|hA|nt|blewah: *know|pg||
nt|psyck: W should have made a simple practical bid of 6@h at some time, once pd responded @s & opps bid @d, he can place @s control with pd|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think declarer should lead the @hJ next|pg||

mb|p|nt|bobholl: bit strong for a NV 2@H isn't it ?|pg||
nt|bobholl: how do you guess the singleton @D as east ??|pg||
nt|bobholl: he just tries to get the contract cheap :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  @s is a strange (to my eyes) choice|pg||
pc|d6|nt|phil: tempting to pass with those club tricks|pg||
nt|bobholl: 1nt looks sound enough but on a @S lead not that good :)|pg||
nt|ugis: 2h = weak 2, 5 card suit possible|pg||
pc|dK|nt|blewah: setting up @h suit and assume captaincy with a void is usually tricky|pg||
nt|bobholl: on any lead but small @D at least 1 down|pg||
nt|marlowepi: easy to go wrong here|pg||
nt|ugis: 8 tricks if they manage to ruff a diamond|pg||
pc|d2|nt|bobholl: 3@S a good tactical choice |pg||
nt|phil: yep|pg||
nt|andyv:  3@c should be forcing|pg||
nt|andyv:  W may opt for 2@s or 4@h|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|bobholl: 7@D goes for only 500 :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  especially since it does not clue partner in at all|pg||
pc|hT|nt|psyck:  3N could be in trouble with the @c break|pg||
nt|danilo1: Hi all|pg||
nt|psyck: which is why i suggested that W should give up chances of grand & settle for the practical way to reach 6|pg||
nt|bobholl: east afraid of his weak @S i guess|pg||
pc|h3|nt|phil: still OK|pg||
pc|h2|nt|henryb:  If you were going to bid 4@s, why not bid 4@c on the way?|pg||

pc|hK|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Harald Skjæran and Danilo Stojanovic|pg||
nt|bobholl: so far for good tactics :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: contrary to expectations, 4S failed in the other room on  19, so Montenegro lost 4 instead of gaining 9|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4H sort of a practical call, though once in a while you miss a slam|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|bobholl: very good @D Q keeps communication and not a ruff yet :)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Walddk4: and to CK|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  Hi all|pg||
nt|psyck:  e.g. a @s lead duck all around would probably beat 3N|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 100 better than -180 but 140 is better|pg||
pc|c7|nt|bobholl: it worked in the end :)|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|blewah: yes, practical bid is a good one if you haven't discussed science with p|pg||
pc|h4|nt|psyck: after 2@d-3@h-3@s cue- he still has option of exclusion key card ask of 5@d|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|frangos007:  3@H not the easiest of contracts - this will need to be played well|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|pg||

pc|d8|pc|d7|nt|skjaeran:  Established communications to defeat the contract|pg||
nt|psyck: even if S did not want to bid 2@h on 1@h other table (in case it showed better hand?) he should have bid it on 1@S|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d3|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|zebutin: yes i think on previous deal you easily can find 7 if you have that in cards, if you start with 3@H|pg||
pc|dA|nt|frangos007:  W might have tried to get her ruff|pg||
nt|frangos007:  in spades, but perhaps she expects to make her @SQ anyway|pg||
nt|frangos007:  declarer now worried about repeated club forces|pg||
nt|frangos007:  so not easy to draw last trump|pg||
nt|frangos007:  he might easily lose complete control and end up several down|pg||
pc|d4|pc|s3|pg||

pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|s6|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but the very fact that the W auction is odd should give N the clue about how W was able to perpetrate  an inconsistent shortness -- W had to know that there was heart shortness in ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: one of the EW hands, and  so N should realize their defensive prospects are probably quite limited|pg||
nt|frangos007:  perhaps West was always going to bid 4@S, but it might just have got passed out|pg||

nt|ugis: might missguess now - it is more likely that N has the A of diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: strange lead if P couldn't bid 1 @S |pg||
nt|henryb:  a strange lead given that partner could not make a negative double |pg||
nt|andyv:  but the vul is right|pg||
mb|p|nt|frangos007:  this is now pushing E/W into dangerous territory|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  great commenters think alike|pg||
pc|h2|nt|skjaeran:  Not the worst of slams, but should stop below the 6-level.|pg||
nt|mathat: 4 @c mb|pg||
nt|marlowepi: apparently 3C was forcing|pg||
nt|ugis: and it takes some nerves for S to play small diamond twice :)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|frangos007:  West far too aggressive for me|pg||
pc|hA|nt|blewah: i would have entered in the 2nd chance too, Seppo|pg||
nt|psyck: it is a good slam, should be bid both rooms|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N dicing with death|pg||
nt|bobholl: in @C only 4 :(|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|frangos007:  almost certainly one down, might be more|pg||
nt|frangos007:  difficult for declarer to guess the heart queen correctly, after this bidding|pg||
pc|hK|nt|bobholl: 2 entries to the @D now|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he is betting as though his majors were  xx    Axxx|pg||
pc|s2|nt|frangos007:  but might get the trumps right|pg||
pc|h4|nt|psyck:  good slam in fact, need little more than one of the fin working |pg||
nt|bobholl: should yes but will ?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: again N refuses to bid 3N|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|mathat: to pass|pg||
nt|ugis: N should play A and 10, not K|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: Running Scores http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11SanMarino/minirama.html|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c6|nt|phil: I thought South was endplayed into it|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|skjaeran:  I'm told 2NT asked for aces.|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3nt is so often superior to 5 of a minor and not only in pairs :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  value of trump switch is non existent...S needed to make an attacking move|pg||
nt|ugis: so that declarer places hK with S|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|bobholl: @S lead and 1 down :(|pg||
pc|sK|nt|psyck: yes, several chances, none of which work here|pg||
nt|psyck: except @d lead :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E had no real reason to double 3S, which only gives more options to NS. on this auction W was already going to  lead a spade eevn with a void|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i understand the 2H rebid by S in context, but there is something wrong when one has to rebid the same 5332 nothing hand to avoid defending. N should have bid|pg||
nt|frangos007:  now now :(|pg||
pc|sA|nt|skjaeran:  By a reliable source|pg||
nt|granguru:  so 2@c must be a relay according @h|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|frangos007:  not now|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|skjaeran:  3NT asked for cuebids|pg||
nt|bobholl: will try to ruff out @H Q and than @D finesse :)|pg||
nt|ugis: sorry, 10 tricks allways :)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|frangos007:  he might have tested North by trying the @HJ instead|pg||
nt|frangos007:  he should have developed hearts anyway, trying to limit his spade losers|pg||
pc|s4|nt|granguru:  i would guess 2@d is a bal hand|pg||
nt|skjaeran:  3H=2 without Q|pg||
nt|granguru:  3n IS A NEW ASKING|pg||
nt|danilo1: thk on 5@D ... Sould shoud bid slam (or 5@S) ... already shown no slam interest before|pg||
nt|psyck: @h drop, @d fin, squeeze, all in vain|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|andyv:  agree...and N's silence makes it difficult if not impossible for S to find the right switch|pg||
nt|ugis: thought he has a spade loser :)|pg||
pc|s5|pc|h5|nt|bobholl: guess this is a 70% slam or so|pg||
pc|sT|nt|psyck:  with @hq & @cK known to be missing, N did not fancy the slam|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|zebutin: if declarer would see all cards, might just try running the @D J|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c8|nt|frangos007:  heart to the 10 or J keeps your losers down|pg||
nt|frangos007:  whether it wins or loses|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|pg||
pc|d2|nt|frangos007:  if it wins, you come back to the ace and repeat the finesse|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dK|nt|zebutin: would opponent really cover from Q9xx?|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|andyv:  however, no damage done as contract does seem normal enough|pg||
pc|c4|nt|zebutin: but ofc that is impossible line in real life, giving 0% chance instead of some good real chances|pg||
nt|bobholl: sry somewhat less |pg||
pc|hT|pc|cA|pc|c7|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d9|nt|psyck:  but on this seq, with @dQ, S could go on after 5@d|pg||
nt|frangos007:  diamond to force the last trump would have been best, claim now|pg||

nt|marlowepi: maybe not for long|pg||
nt|frangos007:  yes, need to find the grand here|pg||
nt|rnmalik: good result from CR for Lithuania.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Not exactly a great grand slam, but it makes|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: unless their EW bid this dodgy grand, the match will be closer soon|pg||
mb|1S|nt|marlowepi: hi roland:)|pg||
nt|frangos007:  amazing number of grand slams in these champinoships - i played two in a single session yesterday :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: just normal result of random deal generator|pg||
mb|2C|mb|2D!|nt|marlowepi: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|wygbe1: good time to splinter|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W palpitating after that 2D call by pd|pg||
nt|wygbe1: with 4c|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|marlowepi: not clear to me that splinter is key to city. W has a lot to tell and a lot to find out|pg||
mb|3H|nt|frangos007:  you really shouldn't bid a grand on a finesse, especially if you are ahead|pg||
mb|3N|nt|marlowepi: S might have stretched a bit with 3C to take a cuebid away from W, but he really has no reason to suspect that there is so much in the cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|wygbe1: this is why i prefer 4c to 3c |pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's a little worse than a finesse, spades 5-1|pg||
nt|frangos007:  West might be expecting a little more from east, so he might push|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sometimes when you are ahead it CAN be right to bid it, because your opponents might seize that chanceof a big gain|pg||
nt|frangos007:  agreed|pg||
nt|marlowepi: however sometimes when you do that (especially when your fit is in a minor), it turns out they had a train wreck and ended only in game (or even a partscore sometimes)|pg||
mb|4C|mb|d|mb|5D|mb|p|nt|frangos007:  yes, and if they stopped in game, bidding a grand instead of a small slam results in a very small imp gain when in fact you are taking a big risk|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hJ|pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h8|pg||
nt|wygbe1: i guess you might as well bid 7 because either 7 will make or 6 will go down on h lead (unless spades are 51 with k onside)|pg||

nt|frangos007:  this was risky but declarer escaped lightly|pg||
mb|p|nt|frangos007:  2@D might have made anyway|pg||
nt|vugraphzcp: Running Scores http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/11SanMarino/minirama.html|pg||
mb|1S|nt|bobholl: the necessaty of 3@C is not clear to me :)|pg||
mb|3C|mb|3D|nt|psyck: which is still a good enough % to bid it|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: ew not precision ?|pg||
nt|frangos007:  4@S by West is makeable, but need to get the clubs right or develop clubs before diamond tricks need to be lost|pg||
mb|4D|nt|psyck: 2@d multi & 3@h pass/correct I presume (I prefer 3@s to 3@h)|pg||
nt|henryb:  Is this an upgrade to 15 - 17 or within range|pg||
mb|p|nt|frangos007:  bad spade break makes the hand not easy to handle|pg||
nt|frangos007:  might get 3NT here|pg||
nt|ugis: one of the boards where either 5 or 7 diamonds can be made :)|pg||
mb|5D|nt|zebutin: maybe polish club or something...?|pg||
nt|blewah: i think they did|pg||
nt|frangos007:  which always makes|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  If its 14-16, South should surely have passed|pg||
nt|bobholl: no slam interest and don't tell opponents too much |pg||
mb|7D|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: N conservatism works here|pg||
nt|frangos007:  I do not agree with 3@H - should be practical - West has indicated a minimum opening hand|pg||
nt|frangos007:  i really do not understand what he is considering|pg||
nt|frangos007:  the 3NT bid is automatic, imo|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: 3@c was an overbid, S expected more with pd|pg||
nt|psyck: ya, i assumed strong @c when i saw Bd 20|pg||
nt|marlowepi: mildly astonishing 10-IMP gain for Montenegro on  20 when NS in other room did not reach 4S. S had a super hand for spades but underbid it  drastically|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: guess a strange upgrade|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ugis: 7 because partner denied cue bids in H and C?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|frangos007:  ah well :)|pg||

pc|sT|pc|sJ|nt|henryb:  Perhaps small countries have to bid aggressively :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@h xfer to @s...with so many values outside of @s suit, passing 1NT is not all that bad.  But, temptation of J109xx suit too much to overcome|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s3|pg||

mb|1N|nt|frangos007:  2NT ?|pg||
nt|ugis: thx|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: now contemplating 4nt at this vulnarabilty ?|pg||
nt|othered1: I'd act, short of @S, probably overcalling 3@H.  Partners are ready for very aggressive action with shortness  in  their suit|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|bobholl: he 's got 21/2 @H imo so double and than 2@H|pg||
nt|frangos007:  well, 3@C not the best bid in my opinion|pg||
nt|ugis: the second segment starts in 40 min|pg||
mb|2S|nt|zebutin: making 9 tricks it seems, when Qx in diamonds drops|pg||
nt|psyck: thx all|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  looks like 3N|pg||
mb|3N|nt|frangos007:  but the final contract is correct|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: got lucky in the lead here, there were several other better spots to play in|pg||
nt|bobholl: he will lead @C now against 5@D :)|pg||
nt|frangos007:  with diamonds breaking favourably, declarer should make, though his hand is short of entries|pg||
nt|frangos007:  but he might try winning in dummy and playing three rounds of diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: most of us would open 1D, so that if they auction goes like this we can say 3C at our third turn|pg||
nt|frangos007:  or the club finesse - either of which works|pg||
mb|p|nt|ugis: after the magic 7d I expect a very close score after the first segment|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ugis: S is a little worried about the spade position here|pg||
nt|ugis: and of course he does not know the hearts are 3-3|pg||
nt|ugis: so it will take some time to declare this one - but, as the cards lie, he can not go down|pg||
