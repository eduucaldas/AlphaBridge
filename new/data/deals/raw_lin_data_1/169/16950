nt|sybarra: hello Stephen and all |pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.ayrshirebridge.co.uk/|pg||
nt|toobad: another|pg||
nt|dburn: London buses, these - you wait all day for a slam, then three come along at once|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  a bit of a 5 or 7 deal on a @s lead|pg||
nt|mamos: mmmmm|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed, but in six you might cash two clubs and play hearts|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  except the doubleton @dQ may come to the rescue|pg||
nt|dburn: perecentages not at all easy to calculate|pg||
nt|mamos: have you got an envelope handy David?|pg||
nt|dburn: though certainly you should not neglect the extra chance in diamonds, so not a "true" five or seven hand|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  must have got the clubs wrong at the other table|pg||
nt|toobad: You seem to have drawn the short straw with your connection Stephen|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C!|mb|p|mb|2D!|mb|2H|nt|mamos: hi all|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|idc: rehi all|pg||
nt|vugraphzwq: Temperemental connection...hopefully be fine now :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzwq: back to spelling classes...|pg||
nt|idc: Thanks for catching up|pg||
nt|dburn: not surprising, perhaps, in view of weak 2@s opening by South|pg||
nt|toobad: the thing to do, if you are only in 5!!|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  midly surprised that East did not add on a point for the 10-9 of @h |pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: http://tinyurl.com/6et3wdn  for results|pg||
nt|idc: Stephen is our operator, network troubleshooter & parttime commentator|pg||
nt|idc: a man of many talents|pg||
nt|vugraphzwq: mmm...|pg||
nt|idc: I see East rather panicked in 3NT last hand, played @d from hand and went one down|pg||
nt|vugraphzwq: play lost in connection error|pg||
nt|mamos: 15-17 1NT|pg||
nt|toobad: a quiet pass by west|pg||
nt|mamos: EW seem to have been too passive here|pg||
nt|sybarra: West not a fun hand to lead from |pg||
nt|mamos: and are maybe a bit lucky that game is not making their way|pg||
nt|toobad: d would be good, but prob AS|pg||
nt|mamos: as it happens West  cannot do much harm |pg||
mb|p|nt|toobad: W will be endplayed a lot on this hand|pg||
nt|toobad: great start for defence|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c6|nt|dburn: still, no one will bid a slam now|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  a poor contract|pg||
nt|dburn: well, it does have the merit of nine on top|pg||
nt|vugraphzwq: well...it does have 9 top tricks :)|pg||
pc|cK|nt|yorkbeach:  unfortunate :(|pg||
nt|dburn: which is not as poor as some of the 3NTs I have seen|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hJ|pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||
nt|idc: we'll see the results of those fiorst two boards at the end of the match|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mamos: someone might have doubled this contract|pg||
nt|toobad: a c now |pg||
nt|jcomyn: hiya - here we have Richard Boyd and hugh gormally fo ireland. Richard works in the cbai office and hugh is the grandson of well known official kay downes.fraid I dont know the ...|pg||
nt|jcomyn: english players|pg||
pc|hK|nt|yorkbeach:  well counted - getting late!|pg||
pc|h6|nt|idc: from now on, will have comparisons from the other room|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|d6|nt|vugraphzwq: Sry...Lost the play... was 4HX and was 4 off...|pg||
nt|mamos: both from the  NE Tom from Yorkshire and Chris from Darlington   |pg||
nt|toobad: E should have played the 10|pg||
nt|vugraphzwq: Connection seems more stable now|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|idc: I've often been in 3NT with 9 top tricks; and sometimes for my side|pg||

nt|sommer: hi all|pg||
mb|1N|nt|vugraphzzn: sry, there seem to be some tech probs|pg||
nt|vugraphzzn: we ll restart in a couple of minutes|pg||
mb|3C|nt|roswolf: and a testing board to start|pg||
nt|daman: very much so    EW will surely reach 4@H|pg||
nt|daman: if permitted|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: I was wondering what we would bid at the table with the South hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: blacks v reds and the spades normally win|pg||
nt|daman: what would we bid as North?   if anything?|pg||
nt|roswolf: i might have tried 3/4@S but 4@C looks right to me|pg||
nt|vugraph814: we have had some PC problems - they are playing board 1 - result in a little moment - SORRY|pg||
nt|smoller: Welcome here. This is first part of the playoff for the Danish Team Championships|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Hello Moller and Povl|pg||
nt|Walddk5: and all specs|pg||
nt|smoller: The 4 best teams from 1. division (a round bobin with 12 team) play semis today and final tomorrow|pg||
nt|sommer: the bidding didnt go like this..just short to the final contract. Makeabale with @Clead and 2 ducks..guess 9 tricks are soon coming up|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Just in time - hi alla|pg||
mb|p|pc|hJ|pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h6|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cK|pc|cA|nt|roswolf: looks like 3 losers assuming a spade switch|pg||
nt|liv71:  claim:)|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|daman: S will win the @C and play a @S|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|daman: and now West has no other play but to duck|pg||
nt|daman: for -1|pg||
nt|monde9: :)|pg||
pc|c7|nt|monde9: sry priv|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c8|nt|hawe45:  Bad timing this 3 @C - with game in @H|pg||
mc|11|pg||
qx|o2|st||md|4SKJ7654H3DA75CKT4,S83HAQT854DKQ3CA7,STHJ762DJT64CQ862,SAQ92HK9D982CJ953|sv|n|nt|mamos: ouch -800 on board one not a help to nerves|pg||
nt|idc: Hard to see this one not being flat as well|pg||
nt|Walddk5: After this round there will be a long break for dinner. Restart at 20.00 local time, in about 3 hours and 15 minutes|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  EW have a lot of high cards but poor shape and two top @d losers|pg||
nt|mamos: bet you didnt expect @d9 to win last trick|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  vulnerability is going to make this board less interesting than it might|pg||
nt|dburn: one thing about these players - they have a refreshing attitude towards getting on with the game|pg||
nt|idc: v 4@h North needs to switch to @d at trick 2, continued @c in OR and declarer had 10|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  yes - we should be finished in time to watch the highlights of the 1st world cup game|pg||
nt|toobad: no time penalties!|pg||
nt|toobad: lightening play lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzwq: :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: does other room result look right?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|toobad: sounds good Guthi|pg||
nt|idc: A point of technique on this hand:|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  2NT agrees spades|pg||
mb|2H|nt|sybarra: looks goofy |pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: in 4@s on say trump or @h or @c lead: draw trump, eliminate side suits finishing in dummy|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  card also says that 2NT shows slam interest - maybe West thought he was not good enough |pg||
nt|idc: then a @d to Q and claim - South endplayed even if they began with AK @d|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  true - but most of the time South has dxA-K he will lead one|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  @dA-K|pg||
nt|vugraphzwq: seems to think he has now :)|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|idc: Of course, they might have led one from @dAK, but no reason not to play it properly :)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  Do not understand this bidding|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|toobad: n might pass this, nope|pg||
nt|mamos: oh its the terrorist 2@c|pg||
pc|c4|nt|yorkbeach:  North will need to switch to a @d at trick two to stop the overtrick|pg||
nt|idc: spotlight on North then...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/6et3wdn  results |pg||
pc|c7|nt|idc: Many players go through this stage in their bridge careers|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  West is hoping for a 6th @s but optimistic even then|pg||
nt|idc: Lose patience on potential slam hand and use Blackwood |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  West should have responded 2NT and so not felt the need to take control later|pg||
nt|dburn: chance for Northern Ireland - right defence not all that far-fetched|pg||
nt|sybarra: lebs |pg||
pc|cQ|nt|idc: Yes, the 2@c bid left them stuck a little over 2@s|pg||
nt|mamos: West is worth no more than a "sound raise " to 4@S  some pairs play 3NT shows this sort of hand as  response to 1M|pg||
nt|vugraphzwq: declarer not looking too aghast...|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|idc: not overtrick - for the contract|pg||
nt|dburn: and it might even stop the contract|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mamos: Jones's 2@C shows a weak hand without Clubs |pg||
nt|vugraphzwq: i think they said it was minors|pg||
nt|sybarra: and includes one major?|pg||
nt|mamos: or with Clubs or something|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cT|pc|cA|pg||
nt|dburn: sadly, though...|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|pc|h9|pc|h3|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|sybarra: I play leb everywhere....so expect the same from rest of world I guess|pg||
nt|mamos: Im told that it's 0-5  with a 4 card major|pg||
pc|cK|pc|s3|pc|c6|pg||
pc|d7|nt|mamos: Copeyfish apparently |pg||
nt|sybarra: so a scramble 2 nt apparently |pg||
nt|sybarra: scramble=just start bidding 4 (+) card suits up the line |pg||
pc|dK|pc|d6|pc|d8|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h6|pc|hK|pc|s5|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dA|nt|toobad: S through for a ruff|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mamos: so wehave England declaring Clubs in both rooms|pg||
pc|dQ|mc|10|pg||
qx|c2|st||md|4SKJ7654H3DA75CKT4,S83HAQT854DKQ3CA7,STHJ762DJT64CQ862,SAQ92HK9D982CJ953|sv|n|nt|daman: he needs to find a singleton KQ of @Ds to make :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: not often that is found|pg||
nt|daman: nope|pg||
nt|liv71:  lazy 6S?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|2H|nt|daman: won 11 IMPs    4@H only in the CR|pg||
nt|roswolf: that non classical weak 2 may produce some action|pg||
nt|daman: Laffineur now up by 19|pg||
nt|roswolf: they have momentum|pg||
nt|daman: Clubs were never mentioned in the CR after a multi auction|pg||
nt|roswolf: but never write off team Z|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|roswolf: e/w frozen out|pg||
nt|roswolf: but they will do well to avoid a largish minus|pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s i mean|pg||
nt|daman: largish must be a British word|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|daman: great stab for a lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: actually scottish because of the ending|pg||
nt|smoller: 1@H is transfer responce, 2@H natural with a strong hand|pg||
mb|p|pc|s5|nt|daman: here comes the tap|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sT|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|pc|h4|nt|smoller: Do not believe the running score, there has not been any boards to compare (I guess)|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|h9|nt|hawe45:  Maybe East should have played just one @D before @H K|pg||
pc|d7|nt|Walddk5: Welcome back to Steen Moller|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|pg||
nt|hawe45:  With another @C.layaout, he woiuld go down|pg||
nt|Walddk5: and welcome to Hans Werge|pg||
nt|smoller: Hello All.. Esp. mr. Werge|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I got the message...|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|roswolf: with the heart finesse right he may try to make his trumps separately|pg||
pc|h7|pc|d8|pc|s4|pg||
pc|hT|nt|daman: that would be wise|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|s2|nt|sommer: the 12 imps are transfered, Steen|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|c2|nt|daman: I see 8 tricks|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Big trouble -. this discard...!|pg||
nt|smoller: This is the second quarter of one of the semis playoff matches in Demarks open teams|pg||
nt|smoller: Pharmaservice had a carry over of 12 IMPS. almost all gone now|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cT|pc|cA|pg||
nt|daman: sorry   9|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup 9|pg||
nt|sommer: half of the 24 imps Pharma won in the initial match|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d4|pc|d2|pc|dA|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c7|pc|c6|nt|smoller: Thank you Povl. There is a carry over from the round robin - 50% if you finish above your opponent, 33% otherwise|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|sommer: yes, Pharma won 21-9|pg||
mc|9|nt|smoller: And they may have a loos on board 1, playing 3@C +2 instead of 4@H|pg||
pg||
qx|o3|st||md|1SAT62HT84DQ7CAJ65,SJ954HK5DJ652C843,SKQ3HAQJ6DA4CKQ97,S87H9732DKT983CT2|sv|e|nt|yorkbeach:  cannot find what 3NT means on their card|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  three rounds of clubs at other table too|pg||
nt|dburn: not sure about that @c8 - seemed to be a half-way house between shwoing count and discouraging|pg||
nt|dburn: but a more usual attitude @c5 might have got the job done|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  foul @d split here|pg||
nt|idc: if playing attitude perhaps she thought @cT might have suit preference overtones|pg||
nt|idc: sorry, meant reverse attitude|pg||
nt|dburn: if playing attitude, your cards do not have "suit preference overtones" - this isn't Humpty Dumpty bridge|pg||
nt|idc: just discouraging with 5 clearly best if normal attitude|pg||
nt|idc: it is if I say it is!|pg||
nt|toobad: Scotland on a roll|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2D!|nt|jcomyn: real junior start both contracts for the high jump|pg||
nt|toobad: 5d would have been worth a shot there|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|6N|nt|vugraphzwq: E thinking ominously but passes...|pg||
nt|vugraphzwq: 2@D  = GF|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: not even you john|pg||
nt|vugraphzwq: OK ...Let's hope connection holds up a little now :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  East was probably wondering whether West is showing a hand too good to open 1NT|pg||
nt|idc: Thanks Stephen - a slight overbid then if GF|pg||
nt|idc: In the other room, SOuth led @s2 v 3NT, and North put in @s9|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  only 8 tricks in view (and that is with @h 3-3)|pg||
nt|idc: so the 10 won trick one|pg||
pc|c3|nt|idc: Any thoughts on North's dbl?   I quite like it opposite a passed hand|pg||
pc|c7|nt|yorkbeach:  the right shape certianly|pg||
nt|dburn: don't mind it at these colours, but might tip declarer to a line he would not otherwise find|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|h8|nt|dburn: still, it's a bidders' game, and North-South certainly play it that way|pg||
nt|mamos: might misplace @SK|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mamos: The English EW  are both experienced and perhaps less "excitable" than many JUniors  Id expect a reasonably steady performance from them|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  yes = declarer needs to duck the 1st @s really|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|toobad: should be 2 off |pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|dburn: could very well do|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  South dozing|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mamos: Robertson may make this   but even 1 off will be a couple of imps|pg||
pc|c2|nt|yorkbeach:  double dummy I can see how to make it: knock out the @hA, cash @h/@c winners and exit with 3rd @d|pg||
nt|dburn: not really - declarer wasn't going to run the four, although he would have made some kind of history if he had|pg||
pc|c5|nt|idc: A guess declarer may be able to put pressure on North, who is holding most of the defensive values|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  declarer is leading twice towards the hearts in case North has A-x|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|sybarra: close to making but 1 off seems right |pg||
pc|c9|nt|yorkbeach:  declarer might have to duck a spade to North to keep an entry|pg||
pc|d8|pc|cA|pc|c8|pg||
nt|toobad: if he runs 10c he will make it|pg||
pc|h4|nt|dburn: still, maybe he should have done - four diamonds, three hearts, one of each black suit...|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
pc|h6|nt|idc: All eggs in 3-3 @c split basket, not that I can blame West for that|pg||
nt|idc: hmm, North should have covered that|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  would have been better to play second heart here|pg||
nt|dburn: ...but he needed more time and more entries than he had to set those up|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hT|pc|d2|pg||
pc|c6|pc|d5|nt|mamos: this will work|pg||
nt|sybarra: how about eliminate spades and play club |pg||
pc|cQ|pc|dT|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s7|pc|s2|nt|sybarra: duck if not covered|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|dburn: it will - very obscure|pg||
nt|mamos: North going to be embarrassed on second top @d|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|yorkbeach:  nothing is certain with juniors|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s6|nt|toobad: bingo|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|dburn: and very pretty - well done West (if he does it)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  N needed to play more quickly here|pg||
nt|dburn: this is a kind of three-suit strip squeeze without the count|pg||
nt|idc: yes, when you are going to be under pressure best to plan early so you can make crucial discard smoothly|pg||
nt|dburn: and one of these days, I expect to see a full discussion of the topic by Julian Pottage|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  mind you - once South turns up with the @sK North's shape becomes pretty well marked|pg||
nt|sybarra: yeahhhhhhhhhhhh |pg||

nt|Vugraphzyf: NS don't have a Weak 2@H so 3@H can be unusual....|pg||

nt|daman: raise|pg||

mb|3S!|nt|roswolf: ONLY 5|pg||

nt|Vugraphzyf: not alerted here|pg||
nt|roswolf: west may/should raise - he has shown a yarborough|pg||
nt|daman: ty Lou|pg||
nt|ady: good afternoon all|pg||
nt|daman: Hi David|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi david|pg||
nt|ady: hi George|pg||
nt|daman: 5@H would SHOW a @H control so 5@S must be asking for one|pg||
nt|ady: Hi Geoffrey|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  They will probably end up in 6 @C, which is much better than 6 NT|pg||
nt|smoller: The notes on the conventioncard dont mention 3@C and 3@S|pg||
nt|hawe45:  N and S are both bridge-teachers, so I am confident!|pg||
mb|3N!|mb|p|mb|4D!|nt|ady: will need the diamond finesse   but will no doubt make |pg||
nt|daman: Laffineur pick up anothe 6 IMPs on Board 2|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H!|nt|roswolf: well that got there |pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: on bd2 team Zlost more imps when 3@S went off in the other room|pg||
nt|daman: Fantoni is not a fast player|pg||
nt|daman: this may take a while|pg||
nt|smoller:  is not a good idea when North has that spade holding|pg||
nt|smoller: * 4@H is not....|pg||
nt|sommer: quite easy to take 9 tricks, tho|pg||
mb|5C!|mb|p|nt|roswolf: really needs the @D finesse ruffing it down in 3 looks wrong|pg||
nt|smoller: I am lost, not being a bridge teacher ant more|pg||
nt|smoller: *any more|pg||
mb|6C|nt|smoller: Even 7@C can be made|pg||

mb|p|nt|ady: hi Hedy|pg||
nt|sommer: ..but hard to bid slam in the defence with small values, so maybe not biddable|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|daman: 9 toppers in NT|pg||
nt|hedyg: most of us would say the @c suit is not good enough for a 2@c bid|pg||
nt|smoller: I litle difficult to bid with a void facing nothing, but the ops bidding may help|pg||
mb|2H!|mb|p|nt|daman: more if @Hs aren't led|pg||
nt|hedyg: @hs get into the picture easily if you play raptor NT|pg||
nt|sommer: 4@C now|pg||
nt|sommer: the 2@C bid helps..imo|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Disciplined pass from North in first round|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ady: can make 4@S from here    |pg||
nt|daman: I suspect the hesitation here is with North?|pg||
nt|ady: 5@D also can make   but difficult  fortunate|pg||
nt|Vugraphzyf: no Fulvio in the tank|pg||
nt|hedyg: double by Fantoni was t/o, do we bid 3@H as E?|pg||
nt|daman: thanks Lou|pg||
nt|Vugraphzyf: West and South on same side of screen|pg||
nt|daman: right   I knew that|pg||
nt|ady: likely n/s will play 4@S|pg||

nt|sommer: ..5@H - 6@S?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|smoller: Yes, he has decided to bid slam|pg||

nt|sommer: yes, and if he has 0, it is not in @C:)|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d9|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w migh have been bidding too much which might have scared n/s into stopping|pg||

nt|smoller: well you said exclusion a while ago, Povl|pg||
nt|sommer: yes..just explaned to the kibz..you knew:)|pg||
nt|smoller: I guess its called voidwood these days|pg||
nt|sommer: that too, yes|pg||
pc|h5|nt|smoller: this is going to be a fast one|pg||
nt|smoller: There is no danger in trying the (unsuccesful) spade finesse|pg||
pc|hA|nt|roswolf: i understand the reason for raising as north but there was a case for passing imo|pg||

nt|daman: he didn't want to have the pain of missing a vul game that made|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hJ|nt|hedyg: the 2@d bid was a case for passing|pg||
nt|hedyg: misfit is rarely good|pg||
nt|roswolf: true and it can be made with open cards i think|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes by pulling A@S|pg||
nt|daman: 3@S was a bold and imaginative bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: in character with Tom|pg||
nt|ady: Kib suggested after 2 rounds of hearts  diamond switch|pg||
nt|daman: can you imagine    EW were not in the auction at all in the CR|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes i can, unlike French players to overcall with the E hand|pg||
nt|ady: not everyone overcalls 2@C with east hand   so then e/w wont be in contention|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes the winning line is quite plausible on further consideration|pg||
nt|daman: but it's not unlike Italians to overcall 2@C?|pg||
nt|hedyg: less so|pg||
nt|daman: so it seems|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c9|nt|vugraphzzn: nicely played for 4 tricks|pg||

nt|mamos: hmm  3NT with two eight card major fits    i dont think the Scots will play 3NT|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  Looks like NS can make 11 tricks in either major|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  3NT is not exactly ironclad|pg||
nt|mamos: no  4@h seems more likely|pg||
nt|dburn: well, what with the hearts as they are, I guess you'd make it ... still, it is perhaps not the best contract|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  4@h is hardly laydown either but I prefer that|pg||

nt|vugraphzwq: not alerted but presumably a game try|pg||
nt|dburn: why - can they beat three hearts?|pg||
nt|mamos: i was wondering if it was alerted but remembered that its EBL regs|pg||
mb|5S|nt|jcomyn: why does s not push vul opps|pg||
mb|d|nt|toobad: s should be bidding 3c|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Our operator is Stephen Peterkin, welcome to you too|pg||
mb|p|mb|6H|nt|dburn: come to that, can they beat four hearts?|pg||
nt|idc: Take your point David but I was worrying that any pair who think South has a game try|pg||
nt|vugraphzwq: no doubles alertable in Scotland...|pg||
nt|idc: may also think North has an accept :)|pg||
nt|dburn: not "on top" - suppose East led his singleton spade against 6@h|pg||
nt|idc: even the 3rd best slam, 6@s, should be ok|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe the best contract is six hearts by South, but that might be a bit difficult to organise|pg||
mb|6S|nt|yorkbeach:  @h lead best as cards lie|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  but West may score a @c ruff to make up the club trick lost on the lead|pg||
nt|mamos: @CQ   is an interesting lead|pg||
nt|idc: I guess the -2 in OR came when South didn't have trump control to set up a long club trick|pg||
nt|dburn: he may, but this lead may also have lost a tempo - declarer would have problems keeping control on a heart lead|pg||
nt|mamos: (is fearless the code?)|pg||
nt|idc: whereas this lead should give him that, so perhaps -2 for a flat board|pg||
nt|sybarra: and a likely push |pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: just pesky that spades are 4/1|pg||
nt|toobad: not under enough pressure in 2... 3 would have been more interesting|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: @cQ would have worked better|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jcomyn: make a lot of tricks in clubs|pg||
nt|dburn: played by North, this might be closer to a five or seven deal than the previous candidate|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  interesting that West did not double 5@c|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  South is trying to work out whether 6@c shows no kings or the @cK?|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h9|nt|idc: good catch - I suspect that he was asleep (understandably given the hour)|pg||
nt|mamos: surely 5NT asks for Kings  odd time for \south to be thinking|pg||
nt|toobad: i think they are all just v tired|pg||
nt|toobad: 7 now!!|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  given how quickly they play, it would have been possible to arrange the schedule for an earlier finish |pg||
nt|dburn: seven? if North believes South's bidding, she should bid at least eight|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and ew will almost certainly bid 3d|pg||
nt|mamos: Diamonds plays well for East  -- and a heck of a lot better thaN @s|pg||
pc|hK|nt|dburn: not ridiculous to try for game with the South cards - those kings look well placed (though one of them isn't)|pg||
nt|toobad: wow|pg||
nt|mamos: it is exhausting watching Junior bridge emotions fluctuate wildly  brilliance turns to idiocy and then back again in a twinkling  |pg||
pc|h3|nt|yorkbeach:  anyone who has been following the snooker, it is heading for a last frame decider between Selby and Maguire - not that we want to stop you from watching here :)|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|mamos: THOUGH THIS IS NOT SO GOOD|pg||
nt|mamos: sorry|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  East did well to read the lead|pg||
pc|cT|nt|mamos: East could just have tried to cash top cards because North had to ruff with winners|pg||
nt|toobad: good to see Richard thinking about best defence|pg||
nt|idc: except for 'brilliance' you could be talking about any of my games|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c6|nt|idc: Well, no UCB 2@d by partner, so it is a little pushy|pg||
nt|dburn: facing three trumps to the queen and clubs headed by A10 or K10, game would have reasonable play|pg||
nt|dburn: so trying for game is only mildly fearless|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  considering what some people overcall on non-vul these days South was hugely better than he might be|pg||

nt|idc: If you have a penalty dbl of 3NT, I think you also have one of 4@c|pg||
nt|mamos: in a way the result does suggest that South was hopelessly over optimistic|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  with 26 HCP EW figure to reach game|pg||

nt|idc: I like that: both sides wanted to play in 3NT|pg||
nt|dburn: but if North-South had been allowed to play 3NT, they would on best defence have achieved an above-par result of minus 600|pg||
nt|dburn: good bid|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  yes 5@h 2@c 2@d|pg||
mb|d|nt|mamos: yes if the double showed Diamonds quite surprising not to try a little push|pg||
nt|dburn: a good save against the 630 available to their opponents|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  let S know that a @c return is futile|pg||
nt|dburn: not that East should have bid it by himself, but maybe he could have asked West's opinion|pg||

nt|yorkbeach:  yes thanks Stephen|pg||
nt|mamos: lots of flat boards in this set |pg||
nt|dburn: well, lots of no-swing boards|pg||
nt|toobad: there will be some chat about this set in the bar!!|pg||
nt|mamos: though they dont feel flat  in fact bloody bumpy|pg||
nt|dburn: some of them do not really merit the epithet "flat"|pg||
nt|toobad: another imp|pg||
nt|sybarra: and this is last hand for this set |pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: well done North|pg||
nt|toobad: a little bit of help never goes amiss|pg||
nt|jcomyn: an aul 3nt|pg||
mb|1S|nt|idc: Sandra Claridge representing BGB and the SBU (match manager Fiona Abbott)|pg||
nt|idc: Another fun one|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I can see that a partnership between Marc Smith and David is not about to happen - Marc loves raising with three|pg||
nt|dburn: still, 11 and 12 have yet to be scored, and Northern Ireland have about 20 IMPs worth of plus positions in those|pg||
nt|idc: Some Easts may feel they are too good for a 3@c rebid, so some will get to a game|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  last board here|pg||
nt|dburn: well, this may temper East's enthusiasm|pg||
nt|idc: Last board today.   Thanks to Stephen Peterkin, our Vugraph operator,|pg||
mb|2D|nt|idc: for allowing us to bring you the vugraph presentation|pg||
nt|toobad: will N bid 2S?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  hope EW do not have the misunderstaning about whether this is a fit jump that we saw earlier|pg||
nt|idc: BGB and their representative Sandra Claridge and Fiona Abbott the Match|pg||
nt|mamos: is there a chance of beating  game here?|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: and as always, BBO itself and you specs for turning up and putting up with myself & fellow commentators|pg||
nt|dburn: is that forcing?|pg||
nt|vugraphzwq: no...|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Restart in 2 hours and 20 minutes. Should be enough time for dinner|pg||
mb|2H|nt|toobad: 2h reverse|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  looked routine until 3@c|pg||
nt|mamos: why didnt she just bid 3NT?|pg||
nt|idc: I trust it will also be enough time for the two npcs in this match to return from medical treatment|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  wish I knew|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|idc: but it has made for an exciting match for us watching|pg||
nt|dburn: pity, really. See you in a little while.|pg||
nt|Walddk5: I can understand her way of thinking. Two empty suits, she was scared of notrump|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  it must be frustrating for the npcs|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  they see what the piars can do in practice matches but when it comes to the real thing...|pg||
nt|Walddk5: They are very inexperienced and playing in front of 500+ specs is pressure|pg||
nt|dburn: good grief|pg||
nt|idc: Manager for the Scottish Bridge Union for letting us cover the event.|pg||
nt|idc: And to my fellow commentators, David, Julian and Mike.|pg||
nt|vugraphzwq: E unsure about 2@H|pg||
mb|4D|nt|dburn: mind you, it might make - South leads a spade, North plays the king, East drops @cQ, etc|pg||
nt|mamos: not sure how they will defeat this|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  hard to get to dummy to get the @c wrong|pg||

mb|p|nt|daman: now they're in trouble    -36 with 7 boards remaining|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|jlall: another pretty boring hand, should be a spade partial for NS, though in the aggressive times in today I could imagine them overreaching to game|pg||
mb|2D|nt|vugraphzzn: bet  E wished to open the 1st time he got the chance|pg||
nt|jlall: I think north should just double here, a bad 15 opposite a passed hand vul is pretty dangerous to bid 1N, and he's 4-4 in the majors|pg||
mb|p|nt|jlall: will be tough to get too high now|pg||
mb|2H|nt|roswolf: transfer|pg||
nt|ady: this looks flatish|pg||
nt|vugraphzzn: only 1@s?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|sommer: around 8 tricks in NT|pg||
nt|smoller: Here we have a nice slam in diamonds - not depends on much more than a succesful double finesse in diamonds|pg||
nt|hawe45:  And 2 NT forcing, naturally|pg||
mb|3D|nt|hedyg: 1@d=@H|pg||
nt|sommer: ..maybe just made|pg||
nt|sommer: just made only with @Dlead, I guess|pg||
nt|wolwerine: Much better on Norths hand - always bid NT when you have Dx in a suit!|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: right:)|pg||
nt|smoller: Maybe 6NT played by North has additional chances|pg||
mb|3S|nt|wolwerine: And here you have it in two suits...|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Good afternoon everyone|pg||
mb|p|nt|jlall: I think 1@S is ok, he is definitely maximum but usually if you have a game partner can still bid over it|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Sry for delay|pg||
mb|4C!|nt|Vugraphzyf: 3@H deny 3 cards in @H|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Hello Sten and Stig!|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 12 tricks|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes every imp will count now|pg||
nt|ady: they might have brought off a slam with east declarer|pg||
nt|Vugraphzyf: Michel Bessis leaves|pg||
nt|jlall: i'd like bidding more if he had 5 spades and 4 diamonds|pg||
nt|smoller: Hejsa Ralf|pg||
nt|hawe45:  DoÂ´nt call me Stig - only the W is common|pg||
mb|4D|nt|jlall: and he has done well to stop low on this layout|pg||
mb|p|nt|wolwerine: But normal to bid 1@S of course|pg||
nt|jbennet: good point. |pg||
mb|4N|nt|sommer: 1NT from N would show 11-14, so thats what he had|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|nt|jbennet: everybody bids 1 sp.|pg||
mb|7D|nt|ralfwil: Hello Hans. |pg||
mb|p|nt|jjbrr:  i also like 1@S, but i might be inclined to raise to 2@S originally with the N hand|pg||
nt|smoller: ohhh|pg||
nt|hawe45:  All depends on the trump-suit - and with the @D 9 with A-Q 10, the double finesse will be the way, RÃ¸n makes this slam - I wrote before seein the end of the bidding...|pg||
nt|smoller: 5@D would for many player show 0 or 3 keys (1430)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Has he counted the @S King?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: looks as the only chance is a stiff @dJ on E, but isn´t|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Or what about the "safe" @D-lead!!!!!|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h2|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|dA|nt|sommer: sort of endplayed on the table now!|pg||
nt|jbennet: but 1 NT is probably the action that would give in average better results.|pg||
nt|sommer: ..must he discard a @S to make?|pg||
nt|smoller: He must guess to throw @S3|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|sommer: @H now and -1!|pg||
pc|d3|nt|jbennet: on this occasion bidding 1sp yealded a minus result. |pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d2|pc|d5|pg||
nt|jlall: I think that is a style thing, some people prefer to raise to 2S with most hands that have 4 directly as kind of a preempt, the classical style is that that shows extra values and ...|pg||
nt|jlall: a game try opposite a max 1@S though|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dT|nt|hedyg: claim 12|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ralfwil: will go down also after a trumph lead|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|s7|nt|jbennet: 1NT bid would most likely have produced a plus score.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jlall: hard to argue with this auction in my opinion, they got to an intelligent contract|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|pg||
pc|s4|nt|smoller: Really Ralf?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  What did I hear Graversen say: "Against stronger opponents, I would have lead a @d..."|pg||

nt|idc: It'll be past the players normal bedtime so not sure what to expect|pg||
nt|mdgraham: good afternoon to all|pg||
nt|toobad: England have 125 and Scotland 89, so Scotland need a maximum victory here to stand any chance of a Junior Camrose win|pg||
nt|mamos: this looks like being the decisive match in this year's Junior Camrose|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: Heh, I'm remembering the only time I was npc for a Junior Camrose - I think they stayed up a *little* later than this|pg||

nt|toobad: which players might that be??|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra2: hi guys |pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: rith and Kerri just played a great match against England  bridge of the highest standard  it may be hard to keep that up|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|mamos: hello all|pg||
nt|idc: My lips are sealed, expecially when it comes to how the bar in the college got broken into overnight|pg||
nt|toobad: they have my full confidence|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  expecting 4@c splinter|pg||
nt|mamos: well Scotland have one more match in hand so something like 21-9 or more to Scotland will leave things pretty level|pg||
mb|1N!|mb|p|nt|mamos: but if England win or hold their own they certainly will be in a strong position|pg||
mb|2S!|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 3NT?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes|pg||
mb|3N|nt|toobad: they only made 11 in the other room on 8 too........ 12 not easy|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: lucky break in trumps. always 4-1 when i bid this one|pg||
nt|mamos: 2Nt is probably the value bid but West would surely bid game|pg||
nt|toobad: assuming Scotland get 25 from their match in hand|pg||
nt|mamos: not sure 4@h is right|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: oh dear|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: West will feel he has some of his hand still to bid but I think you really just have to pass 4@s|pg||
pc|dT|nt|sybarra: not sure you shouldnt let pard play 3 nt |pg||
nt|mamos: Diamond leads may leave declarer struggling|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dA|nt|mamos: this should make s!A was oinside  but  the opening lead will make declarer feel more comfortable|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|jcomyn: not to mention sa over the k|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d6|nt|yorkbeach:  slightly surprised that West did not open 2NT|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  not that 2NT is a great bid|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  with diamonds 3-2 and the king onside, this has play|pg||
nt|mamos: @DK onside but 4-1 trumps will be too much|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  entry situation dictates ruffing hearts rather than clubs|pg||
pc|d9|nt|yorkbeach:  declarer may ruff third heart high and lose a trump trick|pg||
nt|idc: Mind you, I've seen worse slams, if spades were 3-2 it would be making on this layout in @d|pg||
nt|mamos: im a simple soul  i'd have started with top Club|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  me too|pg||
nt|toobad: me too|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|nt|idc: on @cK lead, declarer would have to ruff 2 @c in dummy I think|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  @d back looks best|pg||
nt|mdgraham: expected @DJ there|pg||
pc|c3|nt|toobad: if he finesses 10 d might get hairy|pg||
pc|c8|nt|dburn: I have some sympathy with the actual opening lead; it is generally unprofitable to lead the suit in which some opponent has splintered|pg||
nt|idc: both high, so would fail on this @s split|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|mamos: declarer in charge I think|pg||
nt|mamos: oops |pg||
pc|d5|pc|dK|pc|d2|pc|s6|pg||
pc|c6|nt|jcomyn: that play shows inexperience|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|c7|pg||
nt|dburn: mind you, West did open 1@d, so leading that suit may not be a great idea either|pg||
nt|sybarra: think he is still one short|pg||
nt|toobad: indeed|pg||
nt|mamos: @dJ   looks normal and seems to defeat  contract  declare in control now|pg||

nt|roswolf: and 6bds left|pg||
nt|hedyg: and 6 boards|pg||
nt|jlall: it is worth noting that 2@D by south in this auction will have longer @D than spades if one is longer, so with 3-3 north would pass, becuase with 5 spades south could comfortably ...|pg||
nt|jlall: rebid spades knowing his partner has 3+|pg||
nt|hawe45:  You are right, I fear..|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: sry :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: n/s in the other room were pushed too high|pg||
nt|roswolf: this doesnt look good for team z|pg||
nt|ady: leaders had a bad result in CR   |pg||
mb|p|nt|jbennet: again open 1 NTlike a man.|pg||
nt|smoller: Yes he is, damn...|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|wolwerine: 1 NT would have been 12-14|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But what about just taking your 13 top-tricks???|pg||
nt|smoller: Yes, of course|pg||
nt|hawe45:  5 @S, 2 @H, 5 @D and a @C - come om?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|roswolf: ouch final nail in coffin time maybe|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|jlall: I am kind of surprised south passed, again it is a more classical style to pass with that hand and certainly fine but not really typical at the top lvels anymore|pg||
nt|jjbrr:  also surprised at the 2@H rebid|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: now got worse|pg||
nt|hedyg: well, thats it then|pg||
nt|roswolf: much worse|pg||
nt|daman: turn out the light      the party's over|pg||
nt|jlall: yes, his hearts are quite strong but he is balanced|pg||
nt|jjbrr:  but in this case it works out well|pg||
nt|jjbrr:  i see 1@H was artificial|pg||
nt|jlall: 1N is probably a better contract, but both are easy here|pg||
nt|jjbrr:  so 2@H is his first chance to bid @H naturally, although again i'm surprised they dont play transfers here.|pg||
nt|jbennet: ok.|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|roswolf: but we havent picked over the entrails yet!|pg||
nt|jlall: i think 1H was natural but promised 8+ and 1D would be 0-7, not sure though|pg||
nt|jlall: do you know raluca?|pg||
nt|vugraphzzn: yes, and promises at least 4 cards|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - and let Ralf ruff something, itÂ´s a exercise...|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ralfwil: agree Hans - nice counting:)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I will never be able to understand, why you doÂ´nt open the East-hand with 1 @C - NEVER!|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Someone helped me, Ralf|pg||
nt|smoller: You are too oldfashioned Hans|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but I have told my partners that a lead from Jxx and 10xx into the dark is forbidden.....|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Not dark - sun over DK|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|jlall: ok, so not that different from standard, just a little bit stronger|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hK|pc|h7|nt|sommer: just made, I guess|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|roswolf: surely a small spade was indicated|pg||
nt|hawe45:  About 5-5: If you open  1 @C, you normally will be able to show your 5 @S later. When you open 1 @S, you never will tell about the 5-card-@C|pg||
pc|c2|nt|roswolf: now is this the time of miracles|pg||
nt|ady: no defence as they lay|pg||
pc|cK|nt|jlall: lots of interesting possibilities on this hand for the overtrick|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jbennet: yet. if playing 15-17 NT. then opening 1NT on norths hand will  be the odds-on winner. |pg||
nt|jbennet: and in fact nowadays lots of players would indeed open 1 nT with north's hand|pg||
nt|sommer: could be, yes, despite the 5 controls may turn towards suitplay (in @S)|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|smoller: In the old days the bidding went: 1@C-1@D, 1@S-1NT, 2@S-3@C|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Yes, Steen -  and which contract is the better?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|jlall: double dummy declarer could do what is known as an intra-finesse, playing low to the 9 in clubs, and then running the Q, picking up Tx or Jx onside. Of course this is double dummy |pg||
pc|s9|nt|jlall: and it is normal to play for the king onside|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sommer: now 2 ways to 8 tricks..@S ruff or @H3|pg||
nt|jbennet: 10 years ago such action would have been considered outrageous. (its a kind of evolution process) 1NT with 5242 in the early days was sort of "mutation"|pg||
nt|sommer: :)|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|sommer: did he realy go down?|pg||
nt|jbennet: but it proved to be a positive mutaiton since 1NT created long term plus-imps|pg||

nt|mamos: certainly had chances  if trumps handled differently|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  a better slam this time|pg||
nt|mamos: West knew what he was doing|pg||
nt|toobad: good vision|pg||
mb|1D|nt|jcomyn: agree|pg||
nt|mamos: we'll see|pg||
mb|p|nt|toobad: you should volunteer for coaching John and slow them down dramatically!!|pg||
mb|1S|nt|jcomyn: oh no not overcal;l vul on that garbage|pg||
nt|mamos: good start for Scotland|pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  we might have another splinter sequence|pg||
mb|2S|nt|toobad: its the style!!|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: if East plays auto-splinters, that would be a very good description|pg||
nt|toobad: some start ........... first 2 boards|pg||
nt|mamos: 1NT looks less likely to let oppo in|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: he wasnever taught that|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  with his Dad, Jonny Richards is playing them I am sure|pg||
nt|mamos: 1@d trf|pg||
nt|sybarra: apparently Morgan does not believe in "any 10" opening |pg||
mb|p|nt|yorkbeach:  hello everyone|pg||
nt|idc: If that's a weak 2, I doubt I'd do anything but pass as East|pg||
nt|idc: Hi Julian|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Nice Maior he has|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  Becky must have seen how well the cards lie!|pg||
nt|Walddk5: (sorry)|pg||
nt|mamos: and 3NT is not a good idea  (even if it makes)|pg||
nt|idc: Naughty step for you Roland if we have any more of those puns|pg||
nt|idc: The cards certainly do lie well for declarer|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  2@s is weak but max is 11|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Wales have a complete dearth of juniors such that they have had to make an U25 side out of their U25s and U20s. Accordingly, no Wales in the Peggy Bayer (U20)|pg||
nt|idc: That explains the enquiry from East then|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I am not sure whether this pair could play in U20s|pg||
nt|idc: for many Juniors, an 11 count is an average strength 1 opening :)|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  Harris-Richards could play U20s this year|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://tinyurl.com/6et3wdn  for results|pg||
nt|idc: I guess West is thinking of coming again, holding 6-4 shape|pg||
nt|idc: looks like both 4@s and 5@d are making too|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  I think it must be a connection problem|pg||
nt|idc: I used to have partners with connection problems - between their bids and their actual hands|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  West may have been thinking but not this long|pg||
pc|c8|nt|sybarra: 1 @H=3 hts usually|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mamos: Im afraid that Juniors learn from their olders and not betters :)|pg||
nt|toobad: i'm coaching for Lady Milne and one of them overcalled a worse suit than that 2 weeks ago|pg||
nt|dburn: is his Dad allowed to play in the Junior Camrose?|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  With a full 15 HCP outside of clubs, West should insist on a slam|pg||
nt|sybarra: am told that I was wrong,  could well be dblton or fewer |pg||
nt|mamos: Pass loks a little odd nonetheless|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mamos: I like East's 3NT  bid  good practical no nonsense bridge |pg||
nt|jcomyn: well i can tell you the irish coach will choke him for doing that|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  no but Simon Richards is playing in the WBU team in the Camrose|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cQ|nt|idc: I wonder what the 5@s response shows?|pg||
nt|vugraphzwq: E looking puzzled...|pg||
nt|toobad: me too|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  East is a little mystifed as he is looking at the @sQ|pg||
pc|cT|nt|yorkbeach:  West is presumably trying to show extras|pg||
nt|idc: indeed, I expect West has shown the @sQ and East is wondering if two Queens of @s will threaten slam|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|s4|nt|idc: You may have heard the expression "duplication of values" - I guess both E & W having @sQ counts as that|pg||
nt|dburn: perhaps he was not sure of the percentage play with @sAQ109xx facing @sQxx|pg||
pc|s5|nt|idc: rehi all|pg||
nt|toobad: confidence shaken after first board, i think|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think pass did look odd|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s8|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  West should have done the asking|pg||
nt|idc: expect so; we've all been there|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sybarra: wonder what 1 nt would show after 1 @H on that sequence |pg||
nt|mamos: i think dbl  makes it more likely that 1@H shows three cards |pg||
nt|sybarra: probably a reason N didnt bid it|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s3|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|toobad: long day |pg||
pc|sA|nt|dburn: but I expect West just got confused; pity, because then so did East|pg||

pc|s6|pc|d2|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h2|pc|h7|pg||

mb|2H|nt|jbennet: interesting now.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: no miracle this hand      140 in CR a decent score|pg||
nt|jlall: a low heart would work well but it is not attractive when marina shows that suit|pg||
mb|3D|nt|roswolf: they may well reach 4@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: now what?..EW have been warned about 3NT here|pg||
nt|jbennet: can they reach 4 sp?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jlall: on the other hand...nothing is attractive|pg||
nt|smoller: I see among the specs IB Chr. BanK - how is the situation in Qatar?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: is it possible for E to show his @s after 2@h?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|roswolf: 1@C nat 1@D = HEARTS|pg||
nt|jlall: a spade is obviously a disaster but doesn't seem terrible, the only "passive" lead is a club but with rosu showing 5+ of those that is actually dangerous (imagine partner with Qxx ...|pg||
nt|jlall: for instance) and will not accomplish anything|pg||
nt|jlall: ok, good start for the defense!|pg||
nt|jjbrr:  a low @H lead is a great start for NS|pg||
nt|jlall: great lead|pg||
nt|jbennet: laydown.|pg||
nt|sommer: 4@S is, yes|pg||
nt|smoller: Disciplined pass from South|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||

nt|sommer: W cant go on, can he??|pg||
nt|jbennet: 5 d however is decent spot (which is probably were they going to land unless......... |pg||
nt|smoller: well, if they stop?|pg||
nt|jbennet: east 4 sp is a suggestion to play|pg||
nt|wolwerine: Maybe West thinks 4@S was cuebid|pg||
nt|jbennet: if east were interesed in slam, then he have lots of other bids to make.|pg||
nt|wolwerine: But then East should bid 4@D|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hQ|nt|smoller: yes, 4@D waiting for a heart cuebid|pg||
nt|jbennet: 4 spade should tell west "not interested in slam abut have good spades that can normally stand Hx as support"|pg||
pc|hK|nt|wolwerine: Souths double got East-West out of 3 NT, but without the double North would lead a club|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|hedyg: as a matter of fact 1@c here was not natural but rather 15+ balanced|pg||
nt|jlall: declarer won the first trick rather than ducking because he feared a diamond shift|pg||
nt|jlall: rightly so|pg||
nt|jbennet: would he really??|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c9|nt|jbennet: lead a club?|pg||

nt|toobad: after 3d a 3h bid would gather a 3s cue and then i think 6h is a good punt, but they knew it was on a hook at best|pg||
nt|sybarra: unless someone just blasts into it |pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  card does say 1st discard is suit preference|pg||
nt|jtr: Was very tough|pg||
nt|yorkbeach:  better to have a defensive misunderstanding when only an overtrick is at stake|pg||
nt|mdgraham: hmm 3NT|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|lestergold: obviously no heart lead in open|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you would guess East led clubs and the defence continued them when in with @DA|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mamos: cards lie very well for EW  here|pg||
nt|toobad: H contract EW and D NS .... competitive auction|pg||
nt|lestergold: problem qith 4@c bid it could be interpreted as cue bid agreeing diamonds|pg||
nt|stewball: good lord\|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: for jrs. (always optimistic)  remarkable patience |pg||
mb|2S|nt|lestergold: i stick to my view that north with his great hand but poor spade suit wants to go slowly|pg||

pc|h9|nt|jlall: well|pg||

pc|h2|pc|hQ|pc|h3|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jjbrr:  the @D lead is a bit scary for S|pg||
nt|sommer: looks like W will make this because, he's sort of forced to go the right way in @D!|pg||

nt|roswolf: n/s here have fielders choice|pg||
nt|jlall: EW do actually make a game here though it is quite lucky|pg||
nt|jjbrr:  so double dummy it looks like 4@H makes. @h 2-2, @CK onside, @D3-3|pg||
nt|smoller: Why not double now?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: can N make a X for the unbid suits?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sommer: not strong enough|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzyf: Thomas alerted 4NT as minors|pg||
mb|2S|nt|hedyg: ohhhh?|pg||
nt|roswolf: well he has a preference!|pg||
nt|hedyg: a slight preference|pg||
nt|jjbrr:  but i think they're better off staying low and going plus in a partscore|pg||
nt|wolwerine: I think they play double shows diamonds|pg||
nt|sommer: now?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzyf: now Thomas said to Fulvio " this is NOT minors!" ..|pg||
nt|roswolf: might end up in a doubled contract i suppose|pg||
nt|sommer: nope|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|roswolf: might pass and that works too|pg||
nt|uttam: g eve all|pg||
nt|jlall: 2N i view as kind of a bluff, when you have this west hand you can easily imagine the opponents cold for 4S|pg||
nt|sommer: even 4@S had chances!|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  @S-lead -. come on|pg||
pc|d8|nt|jlall: so you might confuse the matter|pg||
nt|jlall: and if your partner has a strong hand, you might make a game|pg||
nt|jjbrr:  3@S i think should score well, probably -1, given the opps should make their contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzzn: do u agree E has a min hand?|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|wolwerine: North-South play transfers in this situation. |pg||
nt|sommer: ok, yes|pg||
nt|wolwerine: Not good here , but also a good 3@C by East. |pg||
pc|d3|pc|d5|pg||
pc|h2|nt|roswolf: red card will be applied to any bid from now|pg||
nt|ady: decent slam|pg||
pc|h6|nt|jlall: i don't know their style, but for me it is defintely not a min hand white|pg||
pc|hT|nt|roswolf: this gets it off safely|pg||
nt|hedyg: fast lead for Fantoni!|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dK|pc|d4|pc|d7|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hK|nt|jlall: that would be a real max for me :) thats the great thing about bridge, there are many different winning styles|pg||
nt|jjbrr:  I would categorize it as medium. The shape isnt good. the suit isn't great. but it hasn't a strong outside feature which lifts it up.|pg||
nt|jlall: my impression of romanians is that they are very aggressive though so I am surprised by that evaluation|pg||
nt|vugraphzzn: i dont see how this is a min hand, in any system:)|pg||
nt|jlall: is it possible they play 2D as weak multi and 2M as constructive?|pg||
nt|jlall: some people play that, in which case east is a min|pg||
nt|vugraphzzn: at this table we have the old school:)|pg||
nt|sommer: this is one of the good 6's, you like to have a few of|pg||
pc|s4|nt|wolwerine: South would of course have doubled 2@C for take out|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|roswolf: well if east had switched to a minor declarer mightget home|pg||
pc|d9|nt|hedyg: there is no squeeze|pg||

pc|sT|nt|jlall: of course|pg||
nt|vugraphzzn: nop, they dont play 2d weak M|pg||
nt|jlall: raluca do you know if their CCs are posted somewhere? For Romanian championships do you have to submit an electronic CC before hand?|pg||

nt|lestergold: well after opps have missed two cold slams you dont want to be optimistic just sit tight|pg||
mb|1H|nt|mamos: godness knos what 2@c meant at other table but it scored what it deserved|pg||

nt|jtr: Yes, North could have a single @c|pg||
nt|stewball: looks like east is inviting by relay|pg||

pc|d7|pc|s9|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mdgraham: one problem with these hands is that if 3@C is forcing South can't really tell whether North has 6-7 useful hcp or a poorer hand|pg||

nt|hedyg: how do you win 46 imps in 2 bds?|pg||
nt|jlall: they must just be very sound then :)|pg||
nt|jlall: ah finally, an action hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzzn: not really:))|pg||
nt|jlall: EW have a huge result in the other room|pg||
nt|vugraphzzn: no, i dont have their CC online|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Close to a missed @S-GAME|pg||
mb|1C|nt|jlall: ok :(|pg||
mb|1D|nt|roswolf: well i think we can safely congratulate team Laffineur on a very good win - well done|pg||
nt|roswolf: win each board by 4000 point difference|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I have seen players make 4 @S on cards like these|pg||
mb|1H!|nt|Vugraphzyf: 2@D = 5 @H in a weak hand|pg||
mb|3D|mb|4S|nt|hedyg: have never seen 4000, is that possible at all?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jlall: 6D and 6H both make, 6H being a bit better because you might make with 3-2 trumps if the CA is off (and you rightside it, or they don't lead a club)|pg||
nt|jjbrr:  I would expect most table to end at 4@H only, but 6@H obviously is a very good score|pg||
nt|jlall: but very tough to bid|pg||
nt|hawe45:  With a good guess, 5 @D is 3 down|pg||
nt|hawe45:  West must lead the @D King, couldÂ´nt be wrong after Easts support|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Are the players still at the table...?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: very normal contract here..guess a fast flat board|pg||
mb|p|nt|jlall: i agree|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jlall: jeremy do you like 2@H or would you jump?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|sommer: coffee anyone?|pg||
pc|h9|nt|jjbrr:  i like to go low on this type of auction and bid 2@H only|pg||
nt|jlall: i confess id be tempted :)|pg||
nt|jlall: the void is very nice, but having no aces is bad|pg||
nt|jlall: assuming 4D shows strong diamonds, east still has a problem because he doesn't know which shortness west has...if it is short clubs he can basically claim slam, short spades and he ...|pg||
nt|jlall: has some issues...i expect him to move though|pg||
nt|jjbrr:  the dbl by S makes E unhappy, because AQxx of @S looks less exciting... but W gets very excited with his hand|pg||
nt|jlall: maybe with a 4@S cue hoping to get a club cue from partner, or maybe he will be less scientific hoping to not give away the lead|pg||
nt|jlall: still after the double if you're off cashing clubs probably south has them both so I would not be attempting trickery here :)|pg||
nt|jlall: and of course you could be off the first THREE clubs on a bad day, though that seems pessimistic|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|jlall: come on Rosu, 4@S :)|pg||
pc|s9|nt|smoller: Dont go away, last hand is a slam (maybe)|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|nt|jlall: west admits to his club control|pg||
nt|jjbrr:  looks like theyre off to the races|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|jlall: east will bid at least 5@D here|pg||
pc|s2|pc|d9|mc|11|nt|roswolf: yes i once conceded such a score 7@HXX = IN ONE ROOM AND 7@SX Iin the other both making on a ruff and discard at trick 1 in each room|pg||
nt|jlall: well|pg||
nt|jlall: west concerned still by his lack of aces, doesn't like the void after 4@S, and has no @HK either|pg||
nt|jjbrr:  in my style i would cuebid 4@C first to show first or second round control; 5@C after 4@S would show first round control|pg||
nt|jlall: east concerned about bad trumps with the likely bad split...|pg||
nt|jlall: still might stop here|pg||
nt|jlall: i will boldly predict a pass from east :) maybe he shouldn't with the AK of trumps though|pg||

nt|lestergold: oh i may have spoke too soon|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well :) there's quite a bit on this one|pg||
nt|toobad: this should be fun|pg||
nt|lestergold: if theirm partnership style allows south to double with his pile of mgrabage then north should not float it|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mamos: East has messed up here I think|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I predict the p[layers will be consulting the back of the 2@d bidding card if this makes|pg||

nt|stewball: carding problem for \NS|pg||
pc|dK|nt|sybarra: how could you on that bidding?|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mamos: still  only 140 in the OR so no great harm done |pg||
pc|d6|nt|yorkbeach:  yes that is right the North East won the Tolle|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4 tricks in the side suits and north will be endplayed in the trump suit|pg||

nt|toobad: none at all |pg||

nt|jlall: 4C obviously is short clubs, is 3S obviously short spades? it should be but you need the agreement|pg||
nt|jjbrr:  if 3@C was a pattern bid, might that have worked better, in general?|pg||
mb|p|nt|iq007:  inspired double for Popescu to reach 4@h on the previous board|pg||
nt|jlall: it wouldnt have really helped though, east would have been quite turned off by short spades, i was liking their auction until the 5H bid|pg||
mb|4H|nt|iq007:  they really need some VPs as they are the last team in the group|pg||
nt|iq007:  the last two teams from each series go to B league|pg||
mb|d|nt|roswolf: great slam here i dont think|pg||
nt|hedyg: hmm 9@s 2nd entry to N |pg||
mb|p|nt|iq007:  and the first 2 from each series advance in the semi-finals|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Bad luck here to those who bid 5 @D...|pg||
mb|4N|nt|jlall: bidding 4S is quite strong but typical these days|pg||
mb|p|nt|jlall: south will catch a raise of spades and just punt out game|pg||
nt|smoller: Surely void showing|pg||
nt|sommer: on their way now|pg||
nt|sommer: can it make with @C's 5-2?|pg||
nt|wolwerine: South has many losers, maybe he just bids 4@H|pg||
nt|smoller: No, a passed hand in North and wasted poins in diamonds|pg||
nt|sommer: yes, a quiet 4@H seems right|pg||
nt|sommer: ..but for sure 6 is tempting!|pg||
nt|wolwerine: But what about East? Is he thinking about 4 NT?|pg||
nt|sommer: S KNOWS, N cant have both @SK, @HK and @CA|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|hedyg: hard to find the @H lead|pg||
nt|jlall: or not!|pg||
nt|jlall: i find norths pass strange, do you disagree?|pg||
mb|p|nt|smoller: Or 5C|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  The bad luck is very different|pg||
pc|h2|nt|hedyg: A@S|pg||
nt|jjbrr:  I admit I woul bid 2@S after the dbl|pg||
nt|jlall: those jacks are pretty bad but its still 7 points, 3 spades, a ruffing value, white/red...|pg||
pc|h8|nt|sommer: N would have opened with @Dvoid and those 3 top cards|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|jlall: hah, even the delayed raise does it...I think east pushed them there though|pg||
pc|hA|nt|hedyg: now?|pg||
nt|hedyg: should be automatic|pg||
nt|jjbrr:  well. they've made the last guess, which has some merit in competitive auctions.|pg||
nt|jlall: I am not sure why east bid 4@D either|pg||
nt|vugraphzzn: yes, and i also think that supp part in @s is holy:)|pg||
nt|jjbrr:  and in this case does quite well.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|hedyg: if you dont play the A@S you never know what is going on|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|jlall: when RHO bids 4@D you just bid 4@S since it might be a save if 4@D makes, and who knows you might make... if RHO passes it's different, he still might have bid though expecting ...|pg||
nt|jlall: partner to have 2 spades and some values, likelyy in clubs given the auction|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|wolwerine: Actually North did open in the orther room|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jjbrr:  note the other table did quite well with the NS cards also; not sure why EW were so timid. Is 5m very expensive insurance?|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c5|nt|hedyg: Quantin played A@S after J@C ducked|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|iq007:  What are your choices here? K lead or small @c?|pg||
nt|iq007:  If the K is lead you are subject to a bath coup (declearer will play small to remain in control)|pg||
nt|iq007:  small-big is 2-0 until now :)|pg||
nt|iq007:  it depends also on what signals have you discussed with your partner, I prefer to give attitude on Q lead and count on K lead|pg||
nt|zensuni: 2@c by Chelu doesn't make @c lead too appealing though|pg||
nt|rocketer: K@C|pg||
nt|iq007:  So from KQ I can lead both K or Q, Q from something like KQx and K from strong holdings which asks unblock, then count|pg||
pc|d3|nt|zensuni: K definetely looks better if @C lead, or rusinow Q|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dJ|nt|sommer: yes, saw that..then it's impossible to avoid the "good" slam|pg||
