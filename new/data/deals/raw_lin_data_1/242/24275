mb|d|nt|grebrof: 1@h showing +4 @s|pg||
mb|1S|nt|grebrof: 1@s now I think|pg||
nt|phil: I suppose x is takeout of spades, instead of just hearts|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|grebrof: about the @s lead - we all get inspired at times + it earned an IMP, so....|pg||
nt|phil: there's two ways to play here - one is the 'old way' which x is hearts and 1S is a takeout. The newer way is double is takeout of  spades and 1S is Michaels|pg||
nt|grebrof: http://bridgewinners.com/|pg||
nt|grebrof: the live results are dead|pg||
nt|grebrof: or they were earlier|pg||
nt|warrens:  not a great looking 3nt, but they made it at the other table, helped by a @H lead and the very favorable @C position|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|warrens:  my guess is that Rosenberg raises to 2 and W passes|pg||
nt|phil: declarer can easily go wrong in clubs by taking an intrafinesse|pg||
nt|grebrof: anyone just bidding 1nt at E?|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|warrens:  ok now we'll see if they can make this from the W hand|pg||
pc|s5|nt|warrens:  Yes, spectators, I was only half right.  W decided to bid the non-vul game.  |pg||
nt|grebrof: I think W has a nice hand when P can raise to 2|pg||
nt|phil: this looks impossible even if he gets clubs right|pg||
nt|phil: he does know the major shapes of NS - he does not know the minors|pg||
nt|warrens:  I think S comes under pressure on the run of the clubs|pg||
nt|phil: to the specs - an endplay gets you to 8 - where's 9? |pg||
nt|jaapfr: but how can  he go wrong in @C?|pg||
nt|phil: by playing North for Tx|pg||
nt|grebrof: maybe this time he will play the J?|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sQ|pc|s4|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sT|pc|s6|pc|sK|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i expect a push though|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|pc|hJ|nt|warrens:  S can be endplayed twice.  once in @C's|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|phil: well this won't do it|pg||
nt|jaapfr: if he played a small @C:)|pg||
nt|warrens:  hoping to find AQ of @H's with South|pg||

nt|penseur9:  last board of his segment|pg||

nt|penseur9:  thanks to Jane Ball, our great operator for a job well done..|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C|nt|barnets: a prior sout is twice as likely to have @CKQX as !KQ oubleton|pg||

nt|phil: big board for Zia / Chip here|pg||
nt|grebrof: 1 partscore and the other 15 are games bid - not all made - thats teams all right|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1H|mb|d!|mb|2H|nt|grebrof: dbl +4 @s|pg||
mb|d!|mb|p|nt|phil: not 4-5 spades? |pg||
nt|grebrof: dbl 3@s|pg||
nt|grebrof: yes, 4-5|pg||
nt|phil: yeah|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  You need a diamond ruff as your 10th trick, so you must hope to sneak a trump through West|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|Walddk2:  Which Martel did in the open room|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|phil: you can reverse the dummy somewhat but the wrong hand has the 4th club|pg||

mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jaapfr: what a sneaky way to make 4@S in OR|pg||
nt|phil: the theme is "play the suit you do not want the opponents playing"|pg||
pc|d8|nt|phil: maybe Zia is rubbing off on him :)|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|pc|d5|pg||

nt|grebrof: many ways this was the better line|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sQ|pc|s9|nt|warrens:  oops|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|jaapfr: referring to the martel line of play|pg||

mc|10|nt|ryskiel_: iez³y tryk?|pg||
