nt|penseur9:  sorry private|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: waiting for players to sit?|pg||
nt|007 joosth: they are at table  but dont have  a board|pg||
nt|jbennet: east have the chance to come in cheaply with 1sp. enabling wast to compete to 2sp. (west would show a good raise)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I'll try to get the NS CC from ecats |pg||
nt|007 joosth: i believe we first have to sing the french anthem|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: a lot of permutations here in bidding|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: did Indonesia officially surrender then?|pg||
nt|vugraphzns: We are delayed because of the presentation of the Champions of the Venice Cup.|pg||
nt|vugraphzns: After 5 of the 6 sessions Indonesia gave up while France was leading by 93 imps.|pg||
nt|007 joosth: well they started now|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1S|mb|d|nt|jbennet: if east decides not act on 1 d, then EW are favoruties to stop on 2 level.|pg||

mb|2N|mb|p|nt|007 joosth: so other system instead:)|pg||
nt|007 joosth: same meaning|pg||

nt|jaapfr vg: hoi Dan|pg||
nt|mdgraham: a journey of 65 imps starts with a single step (or something like that) |pg||
mb|p|nt|007 joosth: good heart game and club sacrifice here|pg||
mb|2H|nt|jaapfr vg: even 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: weak two, usually 6 cards, 4-9 hcp|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: with the lucky @S 3-3|pg||
nt|3for3: of course, for east west the 'sacrifice' is somewhat unlucky not to MAKE|pg||
nt|007 joosth: a club-contract in W would be great|pg||
nt|jbennet: "this hand illsaustrates the use of "rule of 11"'|pg||
nt|jbennet: useful little decision tool. |pg||
nt|mdgraham: 11 cards in two suits=bid?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|jbennet: "when holding 11 cards in 2 suits u bid on the 11 trick level" (in a guessing situation with no specific info)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|007 joosth: time to get in now?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr vg: just 4@H|pg||

pc|sK|pc|s8|pc|s4|pc|sT|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: if W can not come in after 2@H (which I understand) very tough to bid after 4@H|pg||
nt|3for3: passing throughout with 65 white doesn't give me a warm fuzzy|pg||
nt|007 joosth: also in one of the last TBW someone made a 3C call with something like east-hand|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|pc|cQ|nt|jbennet: but to be fair it takes lots of guts to act on easts hand.|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 3@H  clever  preempt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm sorry  Grue 3@H = Michaels|pg||

mb|d|nt|rhelle: 4@s now?|pg||
nt|ady: part score hand 3@H   for e/w|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: unusual 1NT|pg||
nt|roswolf: a pass from west at green - must be inconvenient for his system|pg||
nt|ahollan1: jump cue = mixed raise|pg||
nt|ahollan1: mixed =  shapely hand too good for simple raise, not good enough for invitational raise|pg||
nt|ady: does not seem to good for a simple raise for me|pg||
nt|ady: not clear cut for north to go as far as 4@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: note that you do NOT preempt a preempt  so Verhees has no bid|pg||
nt|barbyh: how can he pass this?|pg||

nt|007 joosth: when this style of preémpts an invitational bid by N looks better|pg||
nt|3for3: i like the game blast.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes - but if you intend to get to game, bid 4@s directly and let them find a blind lead|pg||
nt|007 joosth: in Holland we all do at this moment:)|pg||
nt|3for3: sometimes you find lho with the rest of the points, and he gets in trouble.  BIG trouble|pg||
nt|kareno: Particularly at favorable vulnerability - could prompt an injudicious entry by opps.|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: with N hand you can not believe 4@S is not making|pg||
nt|kareno: GMTA Danny :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: @D10 = odd number (from CC), although may have SP overtones (hearts)|pg||
nt|3for3: so, it could be count. or suit preference...or maybe even attitude.  the |pg||
nt|3for3: give your partner the card he needs style is VERY difficult to play...|pg||

nt|007 joosth: attitude is impossible when only 1 diamond left in dummy|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: very unlikely he reurns a @C now|pg||
nt|007 joosth: :)|pg||
nt|kareno: First would be attitude or count, second would be SP as I play.  I don't use many count cards on defense.|pg||

nt|calabres: .|pg||
nt|ady: yes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5-10 HCP, 6+@S|pg||
mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|ady: 6-6- west  though   can be highly contested|pg||
nt|ahollan1: interesting choice of 1@C rather than 1@D    system must dictate the opener with 44 minors|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N relay|pg||
nt|ady: needs an ear;y club attack to beat 4@S|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|rhelle: 2@d is very aggrassive, even by De Wijs's standards|pg||
nt|roswolf: no half measures for west|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle: don't try this at home :)|pg||
nt|ady: USA 3 imps on hand 1   4@C -1   and 2nd board could be ok for USA as well|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=0-2@S, <FG,  NF   F1 unless 5332|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so PASS=5@S(332)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C = min, unbal |pg||
mb|3S|nt|ahollan1: so  i don't know what vP was doing :(|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think vP was supposed to bid 2@D|pg||
nt|ady: would not some type of raise in spades be sounder here?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: not much on here    e/w have the balance and a spade fit    but tje 2 level in jeorpardy|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: when the players came in the room, the discussion between Zagorin and de Wijs was about the banana of Zagorin, if de WIjs will get the last or the first bite :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: vanProoijen can locate shortness or signoff in 3/4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: good afternoon all|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thought  deWijs might [keyword] bid 3@S to confirm 4-fit, but  doesn't like @CK or red suit holdings|pg||

nt|vugraphznt: Brink: Sorry...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: steps to show  min/max  unbal/bal|pg||
pc|sA|nt|rhelle: since declarer has 4 sure losers; 2 in each major, the double @c finesse will have to work|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW  carding  upside-down count & attitude  odd/even discard|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ady: could make 4 |pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|roswolf: yes more american imps likely|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ady: this has its difficulties|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in udca  @S4 is ENCOURAGING|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Bathurst checking if EW play 2nd/4th through declarer, and rest of signals|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ady: could be duplicated    unless a sacrifice at the 5 level with n/s cards|pg||
nt|roswolf: sorry folks comment to a spec re previous bd|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|rhelle: and lo and behold ... today, it does :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: lots of questions re the pass of 1 nt by N on first board,  anyone have any insights? |pg||
nt|rhelle: yes, I do|pg||
nt|rhelle: 1NT = good 12 - 15. North has 10, with a 3343|pg||
nt|roswolf: it does show that everyone is watching carefully:)|pg||
nt|harmon: only chance to beat this is with swindle win 1st dwith ace|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s6|nt|rhelle: so a max of 25, and the risk of going off in 2NT for a non vulnerable game|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx that should settle the cannibals down|pg||
nt|rhelle: I'd pass that hand as well|pg||
nt|ady: Netherland may lose around 6 on hand 17  where they stopped in 1NT  with 25hcp|pg||
nt|ady: can pick up club suit for 1 loser playing west for 1 high hnor and 10   doubleton|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and indeed they do lead 2nd/4th thru declarer|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ahollan1: 1@S-2@S = 4-fit   1@S-2@D=art invite maybe 3-fit|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|ady: spades also become good|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ady: can still make 4|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ady: and heart position favourable|pg||
nt|ahollan1: must guess if this is @C position or deWijs @CKQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: either way  Muller figures to hold @HA|pg||
nt|ady: will not need to pin the 10C!  in west hand   rather than play for KQ doubleton|pg||
nt|ady: now|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ady: no club played|pg||

nt|barbyh: no|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW finished set 5 of 8 very late   does anyone know if there were any time penalties?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ahollan1: well that removes all doubt|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ady: has to ruff a spade  so not only needs the J@H with west   but 3-3 split   which it is|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ahollan1: on 18  Grue in 4@H|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|ady: you cannot though enjoy the sspades as that means drawing 2 more trumps   and that will lead to down 1|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cJ|nt|ahollan1: expect that to go down for 5 imps to Netherlands|pg||

mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2N|an|21-23|mb|p|nt|jaapfr vg: DD 6@S makes but would be a Roland slam|pg||
nt|3for3: bathurhust treated his hand as balanced...|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|kareno: Normal to do that.  Especially with a long minor|pg||
mb|d|nt|jaapfr vg: a Roland slam means less than 10% chance a priori|pg||
mb|p!|mb|p|nt|3for3: holdings like KQ dub in partner's transfer suit often play better in the 52 fit...|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: pass of the double probably shows two spades |pg||
pc|h3|nt|jaapfr vg: glad we do not play 6@S whilst kibs tell me it will fail even DD:)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: a fanciful contract :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: even 3nt can fail|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: DD=double dummy seeing 52 cards|pg||
nt|3for3: bathurst will duck a heart, then likely play clubs from top; if so de wijs needs to duck king, play not found in CR|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: yes agree x@H @HK @CK ducked and declarer sure down|pg||

nt|mdgraham: this is one of the prices you pay when you play transfers - most of us do, but it does allow opps the chance ot make a lead-directing double|pg||
nt|kareno: @c k just in case of lucky singleton queen.  Singleton ace is of no help.|pg||
nt|007 joosth: K of clubs now may be, but it can be ducked|pg||

nt|jaapfr vg: not the same Tez?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: there is also the point, made by several specs, that it is just possible East has @HK1073|pg||
nt|jbennet: there is a flaw with that reasoning KJ97xx with north|pg||
nt|jbennet: east might have popped up with the 10 Or queen).|pg||

pc|h3|nt|roswolf: after all that 4@H seems far too boring|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H   likely stopping place|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but 4@S looks to be better contract|pg||
nt|ahollan1: since no transportation |pg||
nt|ahollan1: and @H stoppers going away very soon|pg||
nt|ady: hard to make     bad communications    K@C   looks best shot|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe try  win @H, @S to Ace, @C finesse hoping for Qx in west??|pg||
nt|mathat: mow make if take the 2nd @h and play K @c|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ady: 6@C  good contract   but fails on bad trump split|pg||
nt|rhelle: if you look at the NS hands of board 17 in isolation, and you'd give a score in a bidding competition, you score 10 for 1NT|pg||
nt|rhelle: 6@c: you have a sure @d loser, and a 2nd @s loser if the @dA is wrong. So not so great ...|pg||
nt|ady: Netherlands done well to keep out of alsm|pg||
nt|rhelle: and that is only if the @sK is right|pg||
nt|ady: e/w have 9 tricks in spades with their combined 16 hcp|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ahollan1: vP DBL could include strong NT   so  Verhees DBL instead of @H |pg||

nt|ahollan1:  18   2@H-4@H   yawn|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|nt|sybarra: thought he might duck in both hands |pg||
nt|rhelle: Of course, 6@c looks good even when the @sK is offside - if the @d A is onside|pg||
pc|c5|nt|rhelle: but on a @s lead, it gets decidedly less good|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|ady: now all over |pg||
pc|h7|nt|ady: problems|pg||
pc|hK|nt|rhelle: now declarer has some problems, and needs to start looking for his 9th trick|pg||
nt|frankaus: now what ?|pg||
nt|rhelle: I'd say, start by setting up a 2nd @s trick and advance the @s J|pg||
nt|ady: K@D best chance  |pg||
nt|ady: I think needs an error in defence|pg||
nt|rhelle: East has to duck, otherwise you have another entry to dummy|pg||
nt|ady: J@S   east can just win and return a heart  and no problem then for defence|pg||
nt|ady: does not have to duck   just clear hearts|pg||
nt|frankaus: many ways home from here|pg||
nt|rhelle: I hear various lines of play from the kibitzers.|pg||
nt|rhelle: To be honest, I'm not sure about any of them|pg||
nt|sybarra: but so much easier from this vantage point, dont you think?|pg||
nt|ady: wests play of 10@H  seems odd    maybe a view graph error|pg||
nt|rhelle: Declarer has noted the @h discard on the 1st @c|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: no error, W started @H 10...|pg||
nt|ady: well seems to be an error in defence  10@H lead|pg||
nt|rhelle: Where are the points? the 3rd hand 1@h doesn't promise the world|pg||
nt|sybarra: Muller thinking of every possible distribution,  knowing the @C and (maybe) hts|pg||
nt|frankaus: even from  up here the way forward is not clear|pg||
nt|frankaus: all the kibs and gib make it :)|pg||
nt|petergill: Bauke Muller is trying to work out why East played @H9 at Trick 1. With QJ98x, East would overtake @H10, in case it was a singleton.|pg||
nt|rhelle: declarer seems to have 9 tricks; 3@c, 2@d, 2@h, 2@s|pg||
nt|rhelle: but how to get them before the defence has 5?|pg||
nt|frankaus: welcome petergill|pg||

pc|hT|nt|ahollan1: other room   19 also 3@C south|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|nt|petergill: Hi. The defence makes no sense to South. That's why Bauke Muller, normally slow and thoughtful, is even mroe slow and thoughtful now |pg||
pc|c8|nt|ahollan1: hang on   didn't wooldridge need to duck?|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now 4@C 2@H 2@S 1@D|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: yes|pg||

nt|petergill: 3NT is easy, and 5@D looks OK, but if N doubled 3@C (t/o) to try to get to 3NT, S might pass and 3@CX would be cheap save|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: it did and anothe 13 imps to team america as i predicted:)|pg||
nt|ady: last hand bad for USA   3 hearts could have been beaten and 3@S making|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ady: very controlled auction |pg||
nt|ady: but now it looks n/s may get too high|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: looks like 1 spade and 2 trump tricks    |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C  Puppet 2@D   a) to play 2@D  b) some invitation|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: Have to pick @SQ (unlikely but not impossible) to make 6@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  20  Grue also in 2@D|pg||
nt|petergill: In 2@D, Joe Grue will not go -4, more like -200, I predict|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: that's part of  2-Way Checkback   aka  2-Way NMF   aka XYZ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EW obviously discussed this auction   with  2N showing minors|pg||
pc|c7|nt|rhelle: the 3@h bid proved very effective in stopping EW reach their cold game|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but XYZ applies in other sequences that don't end in 1N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: remember opener only promised 4@C|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ady: 4@S   good contract    case for west to try 4@S    though cant say automatice|pg||
nt|barbyh: 2nt is realy to clubs|pg||
nt|barbyh: relay|pg||
pc|cA|nt|petergill: Other room also in spade partscore|pg||
nt|petergill: West could have played @SJ instead of the third @d, to escape for -200, I think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Grue in same end position in 2@D  so -400 probably a push|pg||
nt|petergill: with trumps 4-1, declarer will need absolutely inspired play to make this contract|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Muller thinks there was a break in tempo |pg||
nt|vugraphznt: and asked for a director|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: North didn't see it|pg||
nt|petergill: Easy for us with all 52 cards visible, but almost impossible to make 6@D looking at 26 cards|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: before the 5@D bid|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Bathurst thinks it was the fastest bid he made in the auction..|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  20 was pushed|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Bathurst leaves to the toilet now|pg||
nt|ady: 2@H   alert 10-15 pts   4+ diamonds??|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: North alerted it like that|pg||
nt|ady: may not be good news when he returns|pg||
nt|petergill: We all saw for ourselves how long it took for S's 5@D - though if we were all polled, we would estimate different amounts of seconds - such is the nature of human memory.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Zagorin: not the dummy I Hoped|pg||
nt|ady: so some sort of misunderstanding|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@S denied @H control  so Zagorin 5@C not only shows the @C void but ALSO @HA|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Think south decided to show his hand like this..|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: I couldn't read SW explanation|pg||
nt|petergill: If S did have a 4th @D, then 6@D would be a decent contract. |pg||
nt|rhelle: so, single dummy, how to play this?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Brink-Drijver start with 1@D [usually 5+]  -  2@C Relay, INV+|pg||
nt|rhelle: 9 top tricks. Where to find 3 more, and lose only 1?|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Zagorin doesn't know how to play yet, according to his body language|pg||
nt|ahollan1: neither do we|pg||
nt|rhelle: maybe take the ace, @h to the 9?|pg||
nt|rhelle: aiming to ruff 2 @h in dummy|pg||
nt|petergill: Maybe he has a chance. Does the 3@C overcall suggest @SQ? More importantly, if East turns up with 4 @D's and 3 @hs when KQ drop and obv only 2 @C's then @SQxxx onside cannot be ...|pg||
nt|petergill: picked up for 4 tricks so the only hope might be Qx doubleton in spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: try to think of the hand as if you were at the table and DO NOT know @SQ falling doubleton|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N was lebensohl or  good/bad???|pg||
pc|sK|nt|jcwla:  great article on 4-5 minors openings: http://www.districtsix.org/Articles/Article%202006-02.aspx   |pg||
pc|s3|nt|rhelle: this switch does not paralyse declarer|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ady: attempt to ruff 2 hearts  which as it happens wont be neccessary  and bank on spade finesse   4th spade discarded on club|pg||
nt|rhelle: if you ruff 2@h in dummy, you only need the @s finesse|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|sA|nt|vugraphznt: Drijver asked if they do it often bid 1NT with a 4crd Major|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s6|nt|ahollan1: wow   other room  Grue in 3@CX|pg||
nt|petergill: he plans to ruff two hearts in dummy then try to pick spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or deWijs to hold @HH10?|pg||
nt|ady: would be betterof without 10@S   which gives the losing option|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@CX should make 6 or 7 or so tricks, one would think|pg||
nt|rhelle: there is also the option of another @h finesse now ... to get rid of the losing @s|pg||
nt|petergill: If de Wijs inserts @H10 on the next @h from dummy, it's tempting to finesse the jack|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Muller probably plays @HK @HQ randomly|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but perhaps @HK would give Zagorin pause|pg||
nt|rhelle: by now West knows that East has the @h KQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: how's that Rob?|pg||
nt|rhelle: so inserting the @h 10 is a doable false card|pg||
nt|rhelle: very unlikely that declarer would finesse the H9 in trick 2, missing only 10 and Q|pg||
nt|petergill: Many lines were possible e.g. if declarer could tell that clubs are 6-2 not 7-1 (at this vul, 7 card clubs might bid 4@C not 3@C), then alt line of ruff club and finesse @S10, ...|pg||
nt|petergill: eventually making on crossruff which needs 1-4 @D, was possible.|pg||
nt|rhelle: if Bauke had the Ace, he'd cash it now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the meantime   the other room, which started 10 minutes after us, is already on board 22|pg||
nt|petergill: We learnt yesterday (Wooldridge's 6@S) that predicting the outcome of the play of slams like this one is difficult|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Muller taking 1 of his famous pauses..|pg||
nt|ahollan1: prediction is very difficult ... especially of the future|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: I heard he is looking for inspiration in those|pg||
nt|rhelle: Muller no doubt hesitating between a trump and a @c|pg||
nt|petergill: Yes, he's wondering why declarer pitched a spade at Trick 1|pg||
nt|rhelle: a trump to stop 1 ruff in dummy|pg||
nt|rhelle: or a @c to force declarer|pg||
nt|petergill: This long think, if read correctly by an opponent, might clue a Grue-like declarer into thinking that E does not have @SQ|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: it looked like he is about to play a @D|pg||
nt|petergill: with @SQ, E might exit more quickly in @d or @C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the Transnational Quarter Final  with 8 boards to score  Gordon over [heavy favorite] Angelini  by 31|pg||
nt|rhelle: assuming what Muller has based on his pauzes is a very dangerous business, I think|pg||
nt|petergill: I think a @d exit is normal now, as if you have a singleton club. Or perhaps exit with @S3?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wooldridge on track to make 5@HX on  2  via double finesse in @C|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|wstuart: Well, the 4-5 minor opening here has no choice - NS are playing a strong @C so the @D is nebulous.|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ady: club lead may beat 4@S    but inlikely to lead club|pg||
nt|wstuart: When N rebids 2@C, he shows longer @C than @D.|pg||
nt|roswolf: SOLID SCORE FOR TEAM AMERICA|pg||
pc|s9|nt|petergill: All the pauses he has done when I've been commentating have been very revealing about the cards he has in his hand, if the oppoent is a Grue, a Hamman or a Meckstroth (i.e. someone ...|pg||
nt|petergill: who can read such things)|pg||
nt|rhelle: interesting ... maybe the Dutch coaches should analyse that|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|ady: 11 to USA   hand 2   5@HX   and made   conceeding 300  at this table|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d4|pc|d5|nt|petergill: Declarer is wondering whether to play @S to dummy for @h hook, or play @HA|pg||
nt|petergill: has gone for former|pg||
nt|rhelle: that, incidentally, is the power of somebody like Helgemo|pg||
nt|rhelle: he always plays at the same pace - you never knows when he has a problem|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in senior bowl   USA2 has opened up 31 imp lead over France|pg||
pc|d2|nt|petergill: the act of crossing to dummy makes @H hook likely - reasonable play on the bidding, simply unlucky|pg||
nt|ahollan1: why not play @H10,  the known card ??|pg||
nt|rhelle: the 8 ... Now West played low-high, techically and even number|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Zagorin saying somethin got de Wijs, and looking under the screen, all de wijs does is grin|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Zagorin: ... it's amazing|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Zagorin shaking his head|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: looking at Muller, maybe he is a poker player and tries to read EW|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Peter -- any comment about @H8 instead of @H10?|pg||
nt|petergill: I've sat EW and followed Bauke Muller around the room EW in pairs tournaments and can guarantee that he does NOT always play at the same slow pace - he takes his time only when he ...|pg||
nt|petergill: thinks he night have a problem. On many rounds, he was finished on time as EW. |pg||
pc|d9|nt|petergill: On this bidding, West had reason to believe the honours would be over his @SA and @CK and @DA - and right he was - but East had just enough for 4@s to be making|pg||
nt|petergill: @H8 could be from K108x. |pg||

nt|jaapfr vg: agree Mike (players and operators must be very tired whilst even some commentators are)|pg||
nt|007 joosth: nothing to add Jaap :)|pg||
nt|jbennet: if he decides spades are 5-3 then he will abandon clubs and enter hand with D and take h heart finesse.|pg||
nt|kareno: He is up to eight tricks.  Hearts present two possibilities (neither comes in) for a ninth trick.|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: 12 days 48 boards exclusive analyzing and system discussions = food for a long recoveryperiod thereafter|pg||

mb|1N|nt|ady: kibs suggesting 3NT   might make       but would make     possible on the lay|pg||
nt|rhelle: I'm sure - after the 6@s disaster yesterday, he doesn't want his opps to keep making close slams|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Brink-Drijver play  3@D-3@S as non-force   not a common treatment|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i typed  before seening   3@C-3@D   so  obviously 2N was for some 1-suiter|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 14-16|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|rhelle: North may well pass this, with a doubleton @s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good point --- probably only at this vulnerability|pg||
nt|petergill: USA2 might be trailing, but like Nickell in past Bermuda Bowl Finals USA2 has the opportunity to play their top four on the last few segments of the Final, whereas Netherlands does ...|pg||
nt|petergill: not seem to have a top four, has 3 top pairs|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: East's Pass of 3@S was very normal indeed|pg||
nt|wstuart: The Americans are not playing well, but they keep winning IMPs.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Grue answered only with like 8 HCP when he doesnt bid game after example 1@H-1@S-3@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: great steal from Bathurst|pg||
nt|rhelle: that preempt worked very well|pg||
nt|ady: good one for USA|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 3@S  absolutel limit|pg||
nt|ady: spades awkward for defence|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ahollan1: 2@S=5@S invite|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 19   4@S made  7 more to USA2|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ahollan1: that opens up  1N-2@H//2@S-2N as artificial to show 2 suiters [and other things]|pg||
nt|ady: with 5 spades and 4 hearts  and no game ambition would just transfer?|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ahollan1: yes|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|sybarra: 12 -14 nt doubtful|pg||
nt|ady: but defence should still prfevail even with jack going up|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4th best lead    Smith at trick 2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Smith helps reveal declarer's falsecard|pg||
nt|barbyh: has not a prayer of making|pg||
nt|ady: always difficult not to play jack in that position    lead  could be from KQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: when not needed to win or show count in declarer's suit --  standard Smith   Hi says  I like the opening lead   Lo says  I don't like the lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: many pairs play Reverse Smith  [think upside down attitude]|pg||
pc|h3|nt|rhelle: 1NT is very aggressive with the North hand|pg||
pc|h2|nt|petergill: 4@D opening at this suitable vulnerability on 8 card suit seems normal to me, but |pg||
nt|ady: this hopeless|pg||
pc|hA|nt|rhelle: 1@d would have been a reasonable alternative|pg||
nt|roswolf: west took a cautious view of his hand - quite rightly at these colors|pg||
nt|ady: looks ligh making 10 tricks|pg||
nt|rhelle: and to add to the insult, he finesses the @c :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not until you see location of @SQ|pg||
nt|ady: to be fair if the spades came in then would make|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|sybarra: system wise,  not sure|pg||
nt|rhelle: 3rd and 4th hand, the restrictions are lifted, as there are no more relays|pg||
nt|petergill: 1NT 12-15|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|rhelle: a GOOD 12 :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: right,  sorry,  said 14 |pg||
nt|petergill: vul in 4th seat 1NT would be 14-15, not vul 12-15|pg||
nt|petergill: NS System Card http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/ConventionCards/2011Veldhoven/BermudaBowl/Netherlands/muller-dewijs.pdf|pg||
nt|petergill: It looks like the @d ruff will hold them to 9 tricks, if West rises on the first heart - he may not|pg||
nt|rhelle: at first glance declarer looks to have 10 tricks. However, after the @d lead, he can choose to lose an extra trump or suffer a @d ruff|pg||
nt|rhelle: so I predict this contract will just scrpe in|pg||
nt|rhelle: *scrape*|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|nt|petergill: West is thinking BOTH - do I play partner for a singleton @D - and - do I rise when a @H is led from dummy later?|pg||
nt|ady: just down 1 now|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: easier to duck @SJ  playing 3rd/5th leads|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sQ|nt|ahollan1:  4 Hurd 3N north|pg||
nt|ady: north straight in   to clear openers suit|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @SA @S3 to show @C entry|pg||
pc|s8|nt|vugraphznt: think he finessed on the speed of Wests lead|pg||
nt|ady: so 11 back to USA|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in college we decided since all invitational bids were accepted we'd change system to make them SLAM tries|pg||
pc|dA|nt|petergill: in 2nd seat, there's 50% chance that partner (not your LHO) has the best hand, in which case 4@D might bypass a good 3NT|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ahollan1: i guess it doesn't matter|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d8|pc|d6|nt|petergill: hence West's very smooth low play on the 1st @H - it was the only chance to beat 3@H|pg||

nt|mdgraham: 2NT opened at both tables, but by different players |pg||
nt|3for3: you dont see that often!|pg||
nt|jbennet: but IF they play 3sp as showing both minors.|pg||
nt|kareno: Sounds like a Bridge in the Menagerie story :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: a 12 imp win NS here in potence|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: potentially|pg||
nt|007 joosth: difficult to understand why you should go for 5 or 6 m|pg||
nt|kareno: 2nt range no doubt 20-21 but many these days just add one to the inconvenient balanced 19 and open 2nt|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: a business man goes to 3nt though:)|pg||
nt|3for3: 3@S would be a relay to 3nt....presumably to show some minor hands...but should south go that route?|pg||
nt|jbennet: and north then bids 3NT then south might find a pass. Another way is to use some sort of stayman|pg||
nt|3for3: no, karen.  the range IS 19-20|pg||
nt|vugraphzns: remember a few hands ago they play 2@C 2@D 2NT as 21-23|pg||
nt|mcphee: although N can ask for major shortness|pg||
nt|kareno: I would just bid 3nt on the theory that 'some make some don't' but eleven is a LOT of tricks to need to take.|pg||
nt|007 joosth: the Hamman rule says:  bid 3NT when in doubt about strain|pg||
mb|3S|an|forces 3N|nt|jbennet: but south migh ask for majors.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|jaapfr vg: business woman:)?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: puppet stayman, transfers, and 3@S->3N available|pg||
nt|kareno: :)|pg||
nt|jbennet: so now 4D.|pg||
nt|kareno: If it's 19-20 as a spec told me, then it's the normal bid.|pg||
mb|4C|an|!D|mb|p|nt|jbennet: and North would then bid 4NT type of "drop dead" call|pg||
mb|4D|an|unsuited for !D|mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jaapfr vg: how not to get @SA @CQ and a @D kibs?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this 3@s as a puppet to 3NT can be useful in describing various minor-suit oriented handtypes, but you should still have 2Nt-3NT=to play    |pg||
nt|007 joosth: you have to lead the spade...|pg||
nt|3for3: needs to take his ace of spades, else declarer could guess the hearts and have no major losers.|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: any 5m is 99% doomed at tr 1|pg||
nt|jbennet: if 4 clubs was mainor suit smolen|pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: ok DD if non @S lead @HA @HQ and ruffing out @HK to trow a @S is the 1% lol|pg||
nt|mdgraham: awkward hand to lead from|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@c showing diamonds (after the puppet) means that the strong hand (the 2NT opener) becomes declarer  |pg||
nt|jbennet: however 5 d just migh scrape home. |pg||
nt|jaapfr vg: note that 5@D gives E an akward problem in leading (sorry kibs I was too fast in concluding 5m was down)|pg||
nt|007 joosth: so maybe play 4C as diamonds  and 4D as clubs    3S as both minors|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mdgraham: the danger with 3NT, from South's point of view, is that it is not too good if North has (say ) Qxx in a major|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 3N or stayman?|pg||
nt|ady: only 8 obvious tricks in 3NT|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|petergill: so Warren's point about the safety play is good - to protect against Q10xx in either hand|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@D invitational or better with clubs|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 3@D preempt     they also have bid to show weak hand with @D & @C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@H shows 4@S|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: N has the 3@s bid almost at the table -- but stops|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: and got a 3nt instead|pg||
nt|ady: dont think this can be made on a heart lead despite specs claims that it can|pg||

mb|p|nt|roswolf: but it can misfire|pg||
mb|p|nt|wstuart: All of their matches have been total slugfests, if you will, in the bidding.|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 3NT missed here|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: sorry 11-15|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 21 [3@D+1]    Muller overcalled 1@S with 3@D    Bathurst in 4@S North|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: And i think he wrote that 3@H was Stayman|pg||
nt|ady: if Q@H played and ducked  then (@C switch |pg||
nt|ahollan1: yeah  calling it Stayman  saying shows 4@S  equivalent|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: but I am not sure -- and N does not have a very nice handwriting :)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|warrens:  laydown on a @H lead, but not so easy on a @S lead|pg||
nt|ady: this maif fail  on a spade lead|pg||
nt|rhelle: True - but I predict the @h10|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|sybarra: oh well commentators curse in action again |pg||
nt|ady: need to be a good guesser|pg||
nt|warrens:  do N/S play 4th best or attitude leads vs nt?|pg||
nt|petergill: Still very likely to make 3NT on @S lead, by playing towards @HQJx twice|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL could have been  Strong NT  [2@H]   so again  delayed @H bid from Verhees|pg||
pc|hK|nt|petergill: More on Bd 21: when experts play bridge back home, they often falsecard to try to trick you. But when they represent their country, falsecards early in the play, like West's first ...|pg||
nt|petergill: spade, are much much less common because experts when repping their country feel some need to play "properly", to not be the person who costs the game. Hence trusting that early @S ...|pg||
nt|petergill: pip = good pip power. |pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|rhelle: they play better seeing 13 cards that I do with all 52 :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is fallout of playing Raptor NT overcall|pg||
nt|ady: now needs switch|pg||
nt|ady: should know  cannot bring in hearts with only 1 outside entry|pg||
nt|ahollan1: duck kills West @H suit  but  @C switch a different grief for declarer|pg||
nt|ady: USA   must  get these situations right from now to have any chance|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Wooldridge knows North  2/3@S   and J9xx in dummy dangerous   seems to point to @C shift|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but they see things deeper than I do :(|pg||
pc|c9|nt|sybarra: lots of clubs played and discards not fun for n/s |pg||
nt|petergill: attitude leads to NT|pg||
nt|rhelle: interesting; there is a double @d finesse as well that can be taken|pg||
nt|petergill: so W does not know if @s are 4-4 or 5-3 - good point, Warren|pg||
nt|warrens:  with attitude leads this is much harder|pg||
nt|ady: well played Wooldridge|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now declarer needs East to hold @SAK     i think|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c4|nt|roswolf: indeed - they certainly turn over the imps|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Bas looks like, come on Sjoert... |pg||
nt|ady: does need either KQ clubs onside   or doubleton honor   as defence do have 3 spade tricks|pg||
nt|ady: thats why I feel  3@H better that double by south|pg||

pc|d6|nt|ahollan1: 6 to play in transnational QuarterFinal   Gordon 72  Angelina 34   both teams have former world champs, but Angelini  Fantunes & Meckwell|pg||

nt|roswolf: on bd 4 usa in 5! @H|pg||

nt|roswolf: in the other room|pg||
nt|barbyh: they wont have any trouble defending this|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d9|nt|rhelle: Yes, EW play attitude against NT, so declarer has no clue about North's @s length|pg||
nt|warrens:  now declarer hopes to learn something from the discards|pg||
nt|petergill: N can pitch 2 @h's and then one more card (=?) if clubs are run|pg||
nt|warrens:  one reasonable line is a @d to the 9, then try a @D to the Q the next time|pg||
nt|ady: likely to play diamond finesse   for contract|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my guess is that immediate @H bids from Verhees say  just 1 place to play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: where delayed auction says 2 places  and that is why vanProoijen pulled|pg||
nt|ady: may just cost a couple of imps playing clubs rather than hearts|pg||

nt|rhelle: well, 2 @h to QJ is 75%|pg||
nt|rhelle: @d to Q is 50%|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ahollan1: EW play Rusinow leads against suit & nt   i.e.  lead 2nd of touching honors|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ady: yes   that does cater for J10 diamonds onside   but in this case might go more down|pg||
nt|petergill: North not vul has passed over 1@C ---> 5 card suit a bit less likely|pg||
nt|rhelle: but that is only if you know @s are 4-4 ...|pg||
nt|warrens:  down more doesn't matter much non vul|pg||
nt|rhelle: remember kibitzers, NS play attitude leads. So the @s2 indicates an honour, not length|pg||
pc|s6|nt|petergill: I think W has deliberately timed his club cashing sequence so N has to discard twice before South discards --> N's problem a little bit tougher|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|warrens:  @D to the 9, then to the Q is 62.5%, so a @H to the QJ means you're more than 80% sure N has only 4 @S's|pg||
nt|petergill: W from the attitude lead knows N has @SQxxx or @SQxxxx so he wants North to discard before S, as S has easy @s discards|pg||
nt|petergill: N has (cunningly?) kept his @H discard until last, to try to look more like a man with 5332 shape|pg||
nt|rhelle: the big strength of NS is their incredibly tight defence|pg||
nt|petergill: (I think) N knew he had to make 2 more discards, so he released the @D (less comfortable discard) before the @H, to make the position less clear to West. |pg||
nt|petergill: If S releases another @S, W can play @H safely unless N has @HAK |pg||
nt|ady: whats the betting here?|pg||
nt|rhelle: I'm going for -1 :)|pg||
nt|petergill: red card discard, else this makes easily|pg||
nt|rhelle: but I'm heavily biased|pg||
nt|petergill: I was wrong - spade discard ---> @S can rise @HA on @H of dummy |pg||
nt|petergill: NS first discard   odd = encourage|pg||
nt|rhelle: Yes, but taking those discards at face value is a direct route to the poorhouse|pg||
nt|petergill: @S point was right, because then @S have broken 4-4, so S cannot throw a @S|pg||
nt|petergill: NS UDCA with 1st discard odd encourage|pg||
nt|ady: 10@H lead in OR    so no problem|pg||
nt|warrens:  we can see by this auction that W's distribution is concealed, making it harder for the defense (and putting us to sleep as we wait)|pg||
nt|petergill: so N's @D6 and @S's @S3 discard were really telling declarer as little as possible|pg||
nt|ady: Netherlands might go in front |pg||
nt|rhelle: Muller is of course known for his phenomenal thinks|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ady: down 2    very nice defence|pg||

nt|vugraphznt: was about last hand :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: everyone either bid or implied @H|pg||
nt|rhelle: tough hand to play. If South has the @hK, North must have everything else - and then it's hard to make|pg||
nt|petergill: Correction - only Oz Open (q/f finished) and Parimatch (one board to go, 60+ imps ahead) have won the Transnat quarters - the other two matches have 4 or 5 boards to go|pg||
nt|ady: will certainly make if taking the right view now|pg||
nt|rhelle: So I think that he will finesse @h - easier than to rely on than lots of other things behaving|pg||
nt|ady: A@D and heart finesse|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that Gordon v Angelini match is on BBO right now --  of the 8 players, 7 have won at least one world champtionship|pg||

nt|vugraphznt: EW lead attitude against NT|pg||

nt|3for3: why? it is not like north had some other great lead teed up|pg||

nt|mdgraham: following on Jaap's point, if pard cues 2@h and then 3@H, there is a good case for treating that as GF; so West may have thought that 3@S was forcing. Even though 3@S is a pinpoint ...|pg||

nt|ahollan1: weak 2@D?    usually shows 6, but at these colors|pg||

nt|petergill: Bd 27: If South was 4333 shape, then 3NT might have been better than 4@S, but reaching 3NT seems difficult|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle: Actually, the 1@h opening on substandard values may help NS in staying low|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N asks Features    haven't seen that treatment in a while|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ady: more likely e/w could make game in hearts    but 4 losers with A@D wrong|pg||
nt|rhelle: 2NT = 4-card limit raise|pg||
nt|petergill: I think they have 40 minutes for 5 hands - in my opinion, South has been the slowest player at this table|pg||
nt|ady: vulnerability wrong for a 5@H save|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but Bathurst also saw vulnerability when he bid 3@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=semi-force|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|sybarra: I think the 1 @C alert is "could be 2" |pg||
mb|p|nt|bbramley: i'll have to get up to speed on the N/S system - not sure exactly what the bids mean - looks sort of like Polish so far|pg||
nt|sybarra: but he always is slow |pg||
nt|ady: but they have taken it|pg||
nt|ady: wrong again|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: hmm   i wonder how they differentiate 3@S & 2N   thought 1 might show 3@H|pg||
nt|ady: nothing going for USA|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: The fact that we're seeing so many transfers (2@H showing spades) in the WC Grand Final is food for thought for those who don't like such methods|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sybarra: and that might e also Bart |pg||
nt|bbramley: i think 1@D=0-7, then natural|pg||
nt|bbramley: if so, i'm a little surprised south did not upgrade to a positive with his good suit|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 1@S was asking. 1@D was or 0-7 or something with both majors or a 3rd option i dont anymore|pg||
nt|rhelle: with 3@d, North shows values. South opts to defend, so North is happy with that|pg||
nt|ady: so the USA in game in both rooms  and more imps for Netherlands|pg||
nt|rhelle: Yes, this looks like -1 and 6 IMPs to NL|pg||
nt|petergill: For the Transnational, the format in yesterday's Daily Bulletin (number 11) overrules any format on the website|pg||
nt|ady: 6 imps   so close to 6 imps behind|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sure with 4-fit in 1462|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Kit Woolsey might argue for lead of 3 card suit |pg||
nt|ady: USA    get lucky   heart lead no chance|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ady: unfortunately 4@H should fail last hand e/w   and 3NT|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sK|pg||
nt|rhelle: South should now play the @sK, in case declarer needs to find the @cQ|pg||
nt|ady: but always likely to get to 3NT   and likely to make  |pg||
pc|s6|pc|s5|nt|ahollan1: blame Jeff Rubens series of articles in Bridge World,  Useful Space Principal  for expanding use of tranfers beyond bids over 1N opener|pg||
pc|s8|nt|bbramley: OK - 1@S forced 1NT, then 2@H was a transfer|pg||
nt|bbramley: so he transferred to play the hand himself :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: this might be a bit difficult to handle |pg||

pc|c6|pc|cK|nt|ady: 5@S could make    but in some danger    has done well to take the penalty|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|pg||
nt|rhelle: Clever @sQ by North - he's hiding the Ace|pg||
pc|sA|nt|wstuart: It's possible for the Dutch to win 6 on the last board.  4@H -1 will be -50.|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ahollan1: for all specs who are asking     3@S wouldn't occur to me either|pg||

mb|p|nt|sybarra: should be doable right?|pg||
nt|ady: good spade slam on 11 card fit|pg||
nt|rhelle: I'd say, looking at the sequence in the other room, that the result justifies the means :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2-3-6... |pg||
nt|wstuart: OK, they did start 10 minutes later than this table, to be fair.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=good 12-15|pg||
mb|1H|nt|sybarra: pussilanemous bid by S |pg||
nt|ady: east has nice hand  but will not be able to buy tje hand under the 7 level|pg||
mb|2S|nt|sybarra: maybe 10 of @H as only entry |pg||
nt|rhelle: 4@s is a bit pessimistic though|pg||
nt|ady: maybe expecting further action  |pg||
nt|petergill: At other table, S led @D4 which worked well|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the other room 1N was 14-16|pg||

nt|ahollan1: confession time   i would never choose @D lead over @C|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: director left after last board, directly slow again|pg||

nt|petergill: from to NT|pg||
mb|d|nt|sybarra: pussilanemous is the word,  "weak in the knees"  timid etc |pg||
nt|rhelle: Unless Muller is playing a deep game|pg||
nt|ady: tranfer to hearts?|pg||
nt|wstuart: This is likely an inv+ xfr to @H/|pg||
nt|wstuart: Generally attributed to Jeff Rubens, often called Rubensohl (or transfer Lebensohl by some).|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H=4+@H  if 2suit, 2nd is LONGER|pg||
mb|3S|nt|bbramley: very light opening - in the modern style, or a very old-fashioned style, if you will - his hand qualifies easily by losing trick count, if not by honor count|pg||
nt|ahollan1: when you give up a trick after lead from Jxxx it usually doesn't come back   but  giving trick away after lead from K often does come back|pg||
nt|ady: cash out for down 1 on club lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bbramley: this is a poor setup for the N/S methods - north has been preempted into showing his second suit at a high level|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe he wants to get doubled in 6 spades |pg||
nt|rhelle: no XX?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wow   i didn't know KTxx was on the list|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Bathurst writing a lot, Zagorin just sitting not alerting..|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: semi alerts 2@C now|pg||
nt|ady: agressive move by north|pg||
nt|petergill: Dbl = penalty, shows max passed hand, acc to their System Card|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=12-14 bal or  1@S444|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: or 5 ?|pg||
nt|warrens:  wow, a striped tale X|pg||
nt|sybarra: no XX,  "we" are happy |pg||
nt|ady: good value for australians|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just announced in voice commentary    Senior Bowl  France leads USA2 by 4+fraction  just a few boards to play|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  25  also  5@HX|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry  our room wasn't doubled|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sybarra: stripe tail ape...preventing 6 sp bid|pg||
nt|petergill: 1050 to 1430 = 9 imps|pg||
nt|ady: Brink has a pretty useless hand for spades  especially on ace king and another spade opening|pg||
nt|wstuart: South surely has a dead maximum for his 14-16 1NT opening.  Facing the inv+ xfr, he has a clear 4@H bid.|pg||
nt|ady: this will fil   so dutch will dow ok here|pg||
pc|h5|nt|vugraphznt: Grue: good luck, this time I mean it...|pg||
nt|ady: fail|pg||
nt|wstuart: It was a 1NT overcall, so he's not at a max.|pg||
nt|wstuart: Still, he has a fine hand with a fit, nice controls and a 5 card suit.|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Brink has no idea if he is on time.. he asked they have 55 min for those last boards|pg||
pc|h7|nt|bbramley: of course, it's usually a poor setup to have a light opener into a misfit|pg||
nt|sybarra: but sometimes pards clubs are more like his spade suit |pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|sybarra: or spade suit is more like the club suit I should say |pg||
nt|bbramley: yes - opening on distro is always optimistic, hoping for a fit|pg||
nt|sybarra: and you probably roll for 6 spades|pg||
nt|bbramley: he has 3 trumps to lose and the @H ace off the top, and there may be a handling charge|pg||
nt|sybarra: the taps maybe the difficulty |pg||
nt|bbramley: although if he runs some diamonds, west may be tempted to compromise his trump holding (but i doubt he will)|pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 12, 2 @S only went down 1 in other room,  for 3 imps |pg||
nt|bbramley: USA2 nibbling away...|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d2|nt|sybarra: and we have a looooooooooooonggg way to go |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C forced 2@D   and 2@S signoff|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ady: maybe double after passing something in their methods|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|ady: Hurd may have tht diamond defensive with west   and only 4@S from Muller    |pg||
nt|rhelle: Now North will reason that EW have a @c fit - and that West will have the @d. So he'll pay a @d to the 10|pg||
nt|sybarra: gee they split 1/1 |pg||
nt|petergill: Then 2@C shows usually 4!+ clubs, u run into your lowest suit. Dbl of 2@H is t/o|pg||
nt|ady: everyone in the action|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5 imps to Netherlands for making 10@H  [5@HX]|pg||
nt|ady: 5 imps for Netherlands hand 25    5@HX  making|pg||
pc|sA|nt|bbramley: from declarer's perspective, all he needs is 3-3 trumps and a winning guess|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry  2@C forced 2@D   2@S = 1-suit invite|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|nt|sybarra: yes give W the East cards and probably home |pg||
nt|sybarra: (the spade cards)  |pg||
nt|bbramley: other room stopped in 2@S and made 140, so this should be 6 imps more for USA2|pg||
nt|ady: win and trump|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|petergill: This is fairly normal - I too play it - that you dbl with a max passed hand, taking pressure off partner's need to make marginal pen dbls when u are passed hand |pg||
nt|ahollan1: not uncommon for passed hand balancing DBL to be Woolsey   4-major and 5+minor|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or 1-suit @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: especially for pairs that play Mini-Landy in 2nd seat|pg||
nt|petergill: North's Dbl backfired as it (unluckily?) pushed EW out of their poor 1NT contract into a better spot|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Mini-Landy = Woolsey but with DBL=Penalty|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ady: hoping to bring in club suit   and lose 1 club and 2 hearts|pg||
nt|ady: thats is the end of that|pg||
nt|ady: sorry  Al   you type faster|pg||
pc|h4|pc|sK|nt|ahollan1: 26 a quiet  2@S East|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|rhelle: but what did East double on? Even at my level, this is suspect|pg||
nt|petergill: Redbl ---> 1600 to 1430 = 5 imps the other way, I think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so sorry   Multi-Landy  not Mini|pg||
pc|c5|nt|petergill: Now that East knows @DA is offside from the opening lead, he can perhaps ruff out the short @DA and make 2@S for a big gain|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c9|nt|bbramley: this room has finally slowed down enough to let the other room get ahead - that will give us comparisons :)|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|warrens:  on a XX, wouldn't Hurd reconsider?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in Senior   France now leads USA2 by 2|pg||

nt|rhelle: However, North's second card will be problematic. If it's a @d, it's made|pg||
nt|sybarra: everyone says @D,  my movie shows club |pg||
nt|petergill: As the card lie, normal(?) defence of @HQ to ace then @DK back defeats 6@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so expect East  5(332)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 4@S after long tht or no long tht  west would surely pass|pg||
mb|4H|nt|sybarra: will S try 3 @H?|pg||
nt|bbramley: yes|pg||
nt|ady: save for n/s in the minors|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: I would win the trump and put N to the test by playing @CK at Trick 2|pg||
nt|warrens:  now, N has to rise on a small @C lead from W, which I think is easy to do looking at dummy's @H's|pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry bd 30 a diamond |pg||
nt|ady: mine shows a diamond|pg||
nt|petergill: Club lead might beat ..... 4@S?|pg||
nt|ady: 6@S  an excellent spot    only down on heart lead and diamond return|pg||
nt|petergill: but is double dummy, @H lead is very normal|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: the E hand looks like the ones I have been holding recently |pg||
nt|bbramley: none vul is best for competing - i'm surprised he didn't, altho he already bid twice and his partner was there|pg||
nt|sybarra: enough!! |pg||
nt|ady: yes   club lead   cant get back and forth|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: yes - when i was a hippy at university abd did something silly like this against Boris Schapiro - he called it a hippy bid and said i would learn someday - never forgot that|pg||
nt|wstuart: Well everyone, I have to go play live bridge myself now.  Have fun and we'll see you tomorrow (or late tonight for those of us on the west coast of the US.)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we don't need no stinkin' invites|pg||
nt|ady: diamonds really   not clubs|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure how EW differentiate Joel Wooldridge's sequence from immediate Michaels|pg||
pc|c2|nt|rhelle: This is though|pg||
nt|ady: bye|pg||
nt|ady: north a bit quiet in this auction|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ady: tricky   must play ace|pg||
nt|rhelle: very well played!|pg||
nt|ady: abd must resist diamond|pg||
nt|ady: yes|pg||
nt|ady: north was awake|pg||
nt|petergill: @CK at Trick 2 could be a singleton king so might be taken, whereas the low club is more certain to draw the unwelcome ace (if @DK was onside)|pg||
nt|rhelle: South played the @c9, an even number|pg||
nt|warrens:  no way he'll play a @D.  W can't have been missing both minor aces|pg||
nt|rhelle: So my money is on another @c, to try and cut communications|pg||
nt|ady: race to 7 tricks    defence can take 4 diamonds and 3 hearts|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ahollan1: @DA asks attitude|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: de Wijs, you really got 6? to Bathurst (but Zagorin didn't hear)|pg||
nt|petergill: 6NT would be crazy to be in - you can bid only your own 26 cards, not bid the 52 cards. |pg||
pc|h2|nt|ady: but of they fail  declarer can take 4 clubs and 3 spades |pg||
pc|hA|nt|bbramley: looks like down a couple, but still a good save vs. the 140 that south could make in hearts|pg||
nt|sybarra: and the OR made 4 |pg||
nt|sybarra: W always on lead, to probably gives a trick somewhere |pg||
nt|bbramley: they may have gotten desperate trying to beat 3|pg||
nt|sybarra: to=so |pg||
nt|rhelle: both a @c and a @c are good - even a @h works as West can't get rid of 3 @ds|pg||
nt|ahollan1: would Bathurst bid 4@H with singleton Ace?|pg||
nt|petergill: S and W are on same side of screen - N and E on other side of screen|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h6|pg||
nt|roswolf: this has just propelled e/w to slam - i trust south has flowers in his hair:)|pg||

pc|d3|pc|d7|pc|dA|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|bbramley: vs. 4@H: possible make even against passive defense if declarer reads the position|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|warrens:  I don't believe it.  what was he playing for?|pg||
nt|rhelle: this is costly - and North has to be careful to not let it affect him|pg||
nt|petergill: NS play UDCA|pg||
nt|ady: played well    and then lapsed|pg||
nt|ady: not much further problem   will lose a spade|pg||
nt|ady: much better spades thant hearts?|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Wooldridge now writing some questions to Verhees|pg||

nt|ady: lol|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice defense|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|bbramley: well done - he made it - now that's a good save - so 7 imps and new leader|pg||
nt|ady: I am sure they would have bid a slam  slowly or quickly|pg||
nt|ahollan1: deWijs hand nice --- for cribbage, poker|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: another DBL that could [keyword] include Strong NT|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|rhelle: Yes, of course, sorry ... the 9 is an ODD number|pg||
nt|roswolf: you never know david - momentum of the auction is relevant|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=game force|pg||
nt|ady: good slam by the Netherlands OR|pg||
nt|petergill: Well bid and well played by Sjoert Brink and Bas Drijver at the other table|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|rhelle: whereas South had an EVEN number of Clubs|pg||
nt|roswolf: south's imagination is working overtime if he thought about bidding here|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: 2@C is something more than 5+@D but couldn't read what was written|pg||
nt|ahollan1: RDBL = 4+@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: this should make |pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: perhaps spades as well|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe not|pg||
pc|cA|nt|warrens:  So, South meant the 9 to show a @H card and N took it as an odd number|pg||
nt|drewsky: It all depends on their defensive agreements...if the 9 of @C was count, then south erred. However, many experts us tend to play suit prefernce|pg||
nt|rhelle: fortunately, NS will sit out the next session|pg||
nt|ady: can make|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D lead director?|pg||
pc|c5|nt|petergill: I think N played W for AKQJxxxxx void x Kxx, but that seems unlikely on the bidding - but he has to trust his partner's count card|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if RDBL=@S  i would think Grue DBL=3@S|pg||
nt|ady: what is 3@H  game try   or barrage after east re-doubled?|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c6|pg||
nt|petergill: South has some extras not shown by 3NT - North might pass. |pg||
nt|ady: Netherlands extending the lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS open very light, so Zagorin doesn't think he has enough to bid over 3N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: beats me     i think they're groping after somebody on wrong page with either RDBL or DBL|pg||
nt|ady: already too high with diamond ruff|pg||
nt|ahollan1: either way   EW auction again putting maximum pressure on opp|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Dutch stop in 3@S on 27  [4@S-1]|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ady: 3@D  making    4@C  down 1    -50   ok|pg||
nt|roswolf: on 9 the expected 10 imps when the dutch made 3nt|pg||
nt|rodal f: B27 some IMPs for The Dutch. 3@SW at OR.|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c4|nt|bbramley: @C9 is a handy card here|pg||
nt|ady: diamond could never be right   unless his partner had the ace    which seems impossible|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: surprised Grue didn't falsecard|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c9|pc|cJ|nt|bbramley: he'll get at least 4 spades and 1 of each, probably an extra club when west tries to cash them|pg||
nt|warrens:  I agree, Peter, it had to be something like that, but that means playing W for a pretty crazy bid non-vul|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr. Was privat|pg||
nt|ady: sorry   should be down 1|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but maybe so many spots out that still @D6 likely doubleton|pg||
nt|ahollan1: tommorow vugraph will be last 2 sessions of our match  and  [i think] 2 sessions of Transnational finals|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dQ|nt|ahollan1: both matches will play same boards|pg||
pc|d3|nt|sybarra: maybe an imp for n/s  |pg||

nt|ahollan1: no  not falsecard with 9  -- i was thinking 5 or 4   |pg||
pc|dT|nt|ady: trying to get shortened    but singleton diamond in South hand stops that line|pg||
nt|ahollan1: vs 3@S on 27   south gets writeup if he switches to @Dx from @DAx   that beats 3@S for a tie if declarer misguesses|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+ unbal 18+ bal     lots of controls so upgrade?|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: The investment in advanced bidding technique by Brink and Drijver, compared to the natural American auction, was the main reason for that swing. |pg||

mb|p|nt|ady: kib suggested 3NT       but that also should fail|pg||

pc|h4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1st session of Transnational Final has already started|pg||
nt|ady: 10 tricks|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|rhelle: As south, you can 'see' that North must have a virtual yarborough|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems normal to shift to @Cx|pg||
nt|petergill: low club now looks normal to me|pg||
nt|petergill: too|pg||
nt|twcho: sorry @c loser|pg||
nt|petergill: Then @DQ - king ..... |pg||
nt|ahollan1: many specs also pointing out @D ruffing finesse to ditch 3rd @C|pg||
nt|petergill: so this looks like more imps to Netherlands|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2 more sets in Senior Bowl and Venice Cup    Bermuda Bowl plays 2 more today and 2 sets tomorrow|pg||
nt|vugraphznt: Bathurst thinking about @H2|pg||
nt|ady: might do it by ruffing out K@D  and coming back with a heart and discarding a club in east hand|pg||
nt|petergill: if North ducks @DQ in normal tempo (unlikely, normal is to cover in case S has the jack), then |pg||
pc|h6|pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: great analyst  says  "thus, ACE and a club may get declarer to misguess who has the doubleton"|pg||
