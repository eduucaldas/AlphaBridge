nt|psyck: the preemption seems to have worked other table with some overbidding|pg||
nt|ady: good afternoon all|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|zebutin: for me 4@H seem little stretched|pg||
nt|psyck: it indeed was|pg||
nt|zebutin: 1@S is 8-11|pg||
nt|sybarra: are you in croatia Matt?|pg||
nt|minimeck: This is a junior tournament, so expect alot of fireworks here, both pairs are pretty agressive :|pg||
mb|1S|nt|zebutin: and 4+ cards unbalanced (or 5+ balanced)|pg||
nt|minimeck: today is actually my birthday, 26 now too old :x|pg||
nt|sybarra: :(|pg||
nt|runnerup: a grand to start |pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: so Koistinen has maximum for their bidding|pg||
nt|moonbeam42:  Two matches to go and both teams have a good shot to make the cut|pg||
mb|2C|nt|ady: no players names yet|pg||
mb|p|nt|minimeck: it's ok, time for our young stars for their chance in the spotlight|pg||
mb|2D|nt|psyck: will play 3@h undoubled here|pg||
nt|sybarra: I thought you might be close to the "edge" |pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: this most likely goes 3 or so down, so small pickup for Finland|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is pretty much a cake walk for declarer,  not much to say |pg||
nt|minimeck: While this appears to be a flat four hearts, NS in the open room got a bit carried away, are now rotting in 4@s x , which appears to be 5 or 800|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: balanced 7points (essentially 6 with Jxx in @D) isn't usually something you want to bid 4with against partners t/o double, even though partner does have short @D...|pg||
mb|p|pc|sA|nt|MolvaM: hi Ian|pg||
nt|vugraphzmy: hi all|pg||
nt|ianmcc: hi all|pg||
nt|minimeck: given we have a nice close nit group here (few kibs so far) feel free to message with questions or comments :)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|wiki: loosing 2 @S @H and @C  or two|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Hi all|pg||
nt|MolvaM: hi valerie westheimer :)|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Hi Murat|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Hopefully we will get the names up soon|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: I mean so we can click on them|pg||
pc|s5|nt|zebutin: at the other table N bid only 2@D at first, and when partner raised to 3@D found more from pre-emptive hand and bid 4@D...|pg||
nt|psyck: I would have opened 3@d too|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|runnerup: hi all|pg||
nt|runnerup: looks quite hard decision to defende 1 @d .instead of play some @s or nt -contract|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 4@s no hope here|pg||
pc|d2|nt|vdoubleu: No p;ay here|pg||
nt|galois85:  good morning everybody|pg||
nt|runnerup: there was not enougth room to be sure so only 6@d bid|pg||
nt|moonbeam42:  Grand looks pretty good with these cards.  KC did not really solve the problem W had, though|pg||
nt|santyclz: E never showed his void - that makes the grand unbiddable.|pg||

nt|MolvaM: welcome to peter lund|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|runnerup: ok|pg||
pc|c7|nt|psyck: @h9 should have alerted dec to the trump position|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Well he stole 1 trick|pg||
nt|ady: nice lay    just 2 diamonds to lose in 4@H|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cA|pc|c2|pg||
nt|wiki: @H ruff possible|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Hi Peter|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s7|pc|h8|pc|s2|pg||
nt|psyck: don't particularly like the @h9 play but N had a tough guess on what to play. Declarer should have probably started @c after winning @hK|pg||
nt|zebutin: @C suit has some chances for defence too... if S ducks couple times with A, might be enough to make Jansons finese @C 10|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ady: hi Andrea|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dA|nt|ianmcc: pls who is where - the flags are wrong?|pg||
nt|minimeck: at the other table for the US we have a very young pair in their first international competition, the pressure of the worldwide audience is not easy|pg||
nt|sybarra: the rest of kibbers do not know what they are missing,  I find the jrs. and youth tourneys much more fun|pg||

nt|zebutin: so AUNI takes the early lead with small pickup|pg||
nt|sybarra: hi Traian :) |pg||
nt|bebechira: Pete and Shane are a relative new partnership|pg||
nt|minimeck: welcome Traian|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: id call that lucky 4 hearts|pg||
nt|galois85:  clearly flags are inverted here|pg||
mb|1C|nt|runnerup: @c lead needed here ( from KJ( to beat 4 @s maybe |pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: 1@C is 15-17nt or 12-16 unbalanced hand|pg||
nt|ianmcc: hi all|pg||
nt|moonbeam42:  1@c is strong (both pairs for the US are playing a precision style)|pg||
nt|runnerup: game fails with natural @h lead here|pg||
mb|1S|nt|minimeck: indeed, :) needed the trump suit to cooperate there. they will take it|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: may be this will end in 1 spade|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: both tables chose 1N to 2@c overcall|pg||
nt|MolvaM: opatija fotos http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.230364477010280.54898.224083290971732|pg||
mb|1N|nt|penseur9: Hi Markkhu|pg||
nt|minimeck: 3nt on a @s lead here appears doomed|pg||
nt|bebechira: the Edgettons in the open room are superstars in our part of the world...|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: usually not 6th club in 1nt, but tells strength quite closely, and shape not too much off...|pg||
nt|minimeck: appears they failed to find the club shift on board 21 so first blood to the americans|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|wiki: EW is bidding very differently in open and closed as close open all 8 or more|pg||
nt|zebutin: not even singelton or two|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, both ok |pg||
nt|minimeck: indeed, will be interesting to see if east raises to 2|pg||
nt|minimeck: do EW play a strong club variant of some sort (with limited openings)?|pg||
nt|ady: with clubs 3-3  3NT easy for e/w|pg||
nt|santyclz: S is pretty minimal for his 1@c bid, maybe they can stay out of game.|pg||
mb|2S!|an|3!s min|nt|zebutin: Koistinen knows that 16 is max for Nyberg... but must have something good for jump to 3@H in zone|pg||
nt|bebechira: Nabil will play in Veldhoven in the open team... the youngest ever :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|minimeck: an interesting trend in junior qualifiers recently, going to 10 board round robin / swiss matches, very few boards with a world championship on the line, :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: very true|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: hi Andre'|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: They seem to be getting too hugh here|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: high|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: They can bail out at 4@c & make that|pg||
nt|pelu: diff to stop with 16 opp 8|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: True|pg||
nt|minimeck: and a practical 2@c bid here by lankveld, will find a very nice place to play |pg||
nt|vugraphzmy: No, but probably 1@s is limited|pg||
nt|vugraphzmy: 1@d is better minor|pg||
nt|minimeck: grazie mille Fabio @h we are in good hands with our operator this morning|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: so well bid on both rooms, might be imp difference for either way, if declarer just takes 6@C+@H+@D+@S|pg||
nt|ady: east will have to give preference to spades  but then west should bid 3NT|pg||
nt|exerdar: 3nt cold but, difficult stop on 3nt with 5-5 M|pg||
pc|cK|nt|zebutin: or if defender tosses 1 diamond away, declarer fineses and takes 6@C, @S, @H , 3@D|pg||
nt|psyck: The winner of this 12 board semifinal will play one of the Finnish teams in the 12 board Finals to follow after this.|pg||
nt|zebutin: or declarer can double finese in @D, but I honestly don't see that happening...|pg||
nt|ianmcc: he lead kindly but still should fail|pg||
nt|bebechira: not a lot of room to "recover"  if you make a mistake :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzmy: :) I hope for you :)|pg||
nt|ady: only preference bid for spades   and with a moderate suit west should bid 3NT    east can always convert to spades with a better holding|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c2|pc|c3|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: But if they get to game (in clubs) probably the heart lead has been pin pointed now.|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: A lot of work to do here, in 4@s|pg||
nt|pelu: hard gamble by W|pg||
pc|cA|nt|vdoubleu: yes|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: This might help|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: i must admit i had passed out 1 spade|pg||
nt|runnerup: 4 @s is about 50% -so should be didden,because without @h lead it has extra chance -like jxx in @d like it is|pg||
pc|c9|nt|ianmcc: pls change names - these are last tim's|pg||
pc|c5|nt|exerdar: hearts 3-3 this good news for declerar|pg||
nt|ady: will have to play well to make this|pg||
nt|exerdar: if just gives 3 spades ,he can do it|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|c6|nt|zebutin: after opponents have bid @D as their suit, Nyberg might have void in that, so @D A isnt pulling all the weight it could be...so disciplined pass|pg||
nt|zebutin: with @S return still 3 tricks coming for defence, which would be 7 imps for finland|pg||
nt|bebechira: we will have 10 rounds of Swiss... and then QF,SF and F|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c8|pc|d2|pg||
nt|minimeck: indeed, Maximo really decided to simply deny them the contract with the balancing 1nt here|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: but 3 clubs is a very nice spot|pg||
nt|minimeck: certainly a stretch but that is their overall style of bidding|pg||
pc|sA|nt|janhamhurg: cash 2 spades and crossruff 6 tricks|pg||
pc|s2|nt|minimeck: QF and SF 3 16 board segments, with a final of 4 14 board segments and (3rd place playoff of 3 segemnts) at least they went to all day matches for the semis and quarterfinals|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|pg||
nt|pelu: didn't N see the bidding - on their way to 3Nt buit no @H-stop|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s9|pc|sT|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|sK|nt|vdoubleu: South was on lead, &, apparently not.|pg||
nt|pelu: W didn't accept the help (3x@D) and disc a @h|pg||
pc|s6|nt|runnerup: @h guess needed and done|pg||

pc|d5|nt|minimeck: it is also interesting to note only 27 teams entered the event as opposed to 40 in istanbul, I was somewhat suprised by the decreased attendence given the location in europe|pg||

mb|4H|nt|penseur9: will EW find their @D fit?|pg||
nt|minimeck: spectator raises the issue of the economy as a possible reason, very true, I personally know of a few teams who had to go to the extreme in terms of raising funds to go*|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ianmcc: slam for N/S|pg||
nt|ady: part score hand    e/w can make 9 tricks in hearts  |pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: this table playing much faster than other table, they have almost taken the 2 deal lead up, so soon no comparisons from this table...|pg||
nt|pelu: 4 losers in 4@h/@s|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|play4fun55:  a good 4 h e/w|pg||
nt|minimeck: and the Netherlands will win 5 back as EW in the open bid their way up to 2nt |pg||
nt|janhamhurg: anyone 2 dia here?|pg||
nt|minimeck: they open very light, i would imagine Garcia da rosa not liking his options here, i predict a shoulder shrugging pass|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 12 imps is alot for winning 3 clubs...|pg||
nt|minimeck: not the best discarding by ferro, came down to K10 of diamonds allowed them to run both suits|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 5 down is a havy disaster|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: now i douth it|pg||
nt|ianmcc: cheap slam|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: In hearts, start with spade ruffs|pg||

nt|ady: this at least down1|pg||
pc|d2|nt|penseur9: double dummy a good NT contract for east/west|pg||

pc|d7|pg||
nt|bebechira: well said Matt... 27 teams... a very disapointing number for a world event......|pg||
nt|minimeck: should arrive at 4s here, after the 2@c multi purpose GF|pg||
nt|minimeck: will be interesting with the 4-0|pg||
nt|minimeck: and another very bold balancing NT here by NS|pg||
pc|d4|nt|runnerup: 3nt looks down in practice @h lead,,-while 5 or even 6 @d -open cards are on|pg||
nt|bebechira: but we entered 2 teams... so this shows that we are doing very well.....lol...|pg||
nt|minimeck: throwing all caution into the wind :)|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dT|nt|zebutin: declarer could maybe get 9 tricks for all important imp, but most likely going to be even board|pg||
nt|bebechira: hi ian :)|pg||
nt|ianmcc: hi traian|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Here comes the spade 8 on the track.|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: do you like it?|pg||
pc|s3|pg||

pc|sT|pc|sK|nt|minimeck: yes, two strong teams at that :)|pg||
nt|bebechira: our goal is 1st and 2nd place|pg||
pc|sA|nt|henryb:  shouldn't be that difficult: five side winners and cross ruff away|pg||
nt|minimeck: do they also have the rule here regarding semifinals and two teams from the same country (as with the bermuda bowl and USA1/2)?|pg||
nt|bebechira: good point , lol|pg||
nt|henryb:  Probably|pg||
nt|minimeck: will hit the jackpot, however, with p's double heart stopper, to me personally the risk seems far greater than the reward|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|psyck: sooner or later we will have one big board which will decide the match :)|pg||
nt|runnerup: this has chance to make ,but probably fales -ew can make 110 in @s but not easy to come in|pg||
pc|s9|nt|bebechira: i will give a link with a teriffic youtube video made by Maz ( east here)|pg||
nt|ady: 2@S would show this type of hand   but west heart suit poor  when going to at least the 3 level|pg||
pc|s6|nt|play4fun55:  4 makes on a nice dummy reversal|pg||

pc|h5|pg||
nt|wiki: Linden is  now very conservative / not bidding 2 @D|pg||

nt|zebutin: atleast Koistinen is honest...|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|nt|zebutin: now most likely takes 1 round of spades and tries @H ruff...|pg||

pc|h6|nt|minimeck: in the previous event Tebha represented pakistan, following in Zia's footsteps now with the USA|pg||
nt|minimeck: ARG URU, really showing an agressive intent in these matches we have seen so far, yesterday against japan they recieved a speeding ticket on the first board |pg||
pc|hK|nt|zebutin: now with @C finese could thros @H to strong @C|pg||

nt|wiki: ok  still the marks wrong|pg||
nt|zebutin: to me 2 rounds of @S at that point seem stricly worse than just 1 round and play @H A + H (because if you get ruffed with last @S, you still have 1 @S in dummy to ruff last @H ...|pg||
nt|zebutin: with)|pg||
nt|zebutin: but wasn't really more at stake than 1 imp again...|pg||
nt|ianmcc: very cheap slam|pg||
nt|bebechira: the Aussies playing this event with 2 teams|pg||
nt|ianmcc: both very good teams|pg||
nt|bebechira: this has to show the depth of our youth |pg||
nt|bebechira: agree Ian...fantastic teams|pg||
nt|bebechira: a lot of superstars in the teams|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: 3NT might make here by South, on a spade lead|pg||
nt|minimeck: i do like the choice made at the other table however, with a 3rd seat opener of 1d, that seems much more preferable to the balance|pg||
nt|ady: spade slam here|pg||
nt|exerdar: a slam board.. every slam possible withouth hearts:)|pg||
nt|ady: should get there if south opens 2@C|pg||
nt|exerdar: ofcourse nt|pg||
nt|santyclz: Must have returned the @c.|pg||
nt|moonbeam42:  I guess they returned the @cQ|pg||
nt|runnerup: this looks like 6 @c |pg||
mb|1C|nt|MolvaM: the official event page http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Opatija.11/Opatija11.htm|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|wiki: maybe we can live with these  still 9 deals, sorry|pg||
nt|pelu: yes 1Nt - 3NT|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Did he really make 9 tricks on 23?|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: Hi folks.|pg||
nt|bebechira: the cheap slam scored 13 for us :)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|janhamhurg: 4 hearts makes on a spade lead, but will be difficult on a dia or a cl lead|pg||
nt|exerdar: 4nt ?|pg||
nt|moonbeam42:  Yeah, I think she did|pg||
nt|Walddk4: she, sorry|pg||
nt|santyclz: It's possible the way the play was shown. |pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: may not be so easy to reach a slam after 1 spade opened|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|penseur9: a strong @H contract here for EW|pg||
nt|ianmcc: cards lie well for 3NT|pg||
nt|minimeck: not sure if EW have changed their NT ranges, would have expected a 2nt opener from brescoll here, 1@c will work much better :p|pg||
nt|moonbeam42:  at the other table, 1N went down 2|pg||
nt|moonbeam42:  A nice start for US|pg||
nt|santyclz: The defense here was "suboptimal".|pg||
nt|runnerup: but can they find @c here |pg||
mb|p|nt|vdoubleu: :)|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: He should play all to make this and will.|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: E/W got this one cheap, might even make, or @D H lead making comfortably...|pg||
nt|zebutin: 3nt seems like normal spot to be in, might have some difficulties with entries for @C, but when @D 10 drops has always sure entry|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 4@h might need a good guess  in clubs|pg||
nt|sybarra: are you fond of 2 nt with W?|pg||
mb|p|nt|wiki: 6 @C is on and  needs 1/1 clubs  which is odds or @h finesse  also you can try to get cover on @DQ|pg||
nt|bebechira: Juzz has a very good feel at the table.... i think he will make this|pg||
nt|ianmcc: maybe not - perhaps a discard on @d|pg||
nt|moonbeam42:  Any guesses as to what 2@c here was showing?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Looks like "pointed top" suits - @s and @ds.|pg||
nt|santyclz: That's just a guess though.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|bebechira: 2 aces and a trump|pg||
nt|bebechira: in theory lol|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|runnerup: previos hand number 2 both rooms made 4 @s -which should have been beaten -no guess in @h helps if south takes his ace and playes a small @c to his partner to play @s |pg||
nt|penseur9: the lead will decide how many extra tricks|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ady: 4NT does not really get the imformation of great diamond cards  and the Q@C   and nothing opposite the singleton heart|pg||
nt|moonbeam42:  Hard to bid 6 with only one ace|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|ianmcc: this helps. Now the discard a real possibility|pg||
pc|s7|nt|minimeck: 3nt a good spot on this hand|pg||
nt|minimeck: Welcome everyone, sorry for delay on commentator :)|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Matt and Göran|pg||
nt|gsper:  Hi|pg||
nt|vugraphzmy: we are waiting you minimeck :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: Two suits of the same shape, a CRaSh-like bid.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|play4fun55:  still some work to be done|pg||
nt|ady: now may get there|pg||
nt|galois85:  what is E thinking about?|pg||
nt|ady: better west refraains from the double of 3@H  when he will be on lead |pg||
nt|exerdar: probably south is thinking|pg||
pc|s4|nt|bebechira: 10 boards matches... not a lot of boards to recover the bad ones :)|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|zebutin: or without @S lead has always sure entry in @S suit|pg||
nt|minimeck: currently our 4th and 5th place teams here, should have no problem making here :)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|janhamhurg: 3 no looks fine|pg||
nt|minimeck: and indeed that is where they will play it :)|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: lol your lead:)|pg||
nt|minimeck: i expect a spade lead here from west, although he has some choices, no winning options :p|pg||
nt|runnerup: 4 @d could have been 800 with best defence ,but now 420 |pg||
pc|cJ|nt|wiki: I thin 4 @D is splinter|pg||
nt|wiki: luckily we have very qualified operator|pg||
nt|minimeck: although a diamond is more logical|pg||
nt|minimeck: given the fact if his partner had any real spades he likely would have opened in 3rd seat|pg||
pc|c7|nt|wiki: well done ladies|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|wiki: you have problems only if  clubs are 2 0 with W  East can easily be endplayed|pg||

nt|runnerup: that @d fit 7-3 was found in other table -some help from defended ofcause by double to 3nt -spades badly|pg||

nt|bebechira: they missed a vulnerable game...it will be expensive |pg||
nt|minimeck: i should correct my self, not really garbage, an 0-5-4-4 9 count, but. when opening hands like that, have to draw a line somewhere :)|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 4 spade / 5 dia, who will make the bidding?|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|nt|penseur9: we're back|pg||
nt|zebutin: cards sitting extremely well for E/W, so @H making 11 tricks if they play at it|pg||
nt|psyck: another good result for Latvia here|pg||
nt|psyck: looks like some misdef other room|pg||
nt|ianmcc: routine 4@s E/W|pg||
nt|minimeck: slam time NS|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Maybe North shld bid a simple 3N|pg||
nt|santyclz: "Midnight swiss" weak 2?|pg||
nt|runnerup: is south going to pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: 4@C most likely Namyats,promising foor hand in @H|pg||
nt|henryb:  Assuming that is a weak weak 2, I would pass as S|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: this deal will extend the lead significantly|pg||
nt|zebutin: seems like defence could get 2@S, @C, @D, @H in 5@D, so they might have slipped a little|pg||
nt|vugraphzhm: a little :)|pg||
nt|psyck: :)|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 3 spade is ok now i thk|pg||
nt|minimeck: interesting choice of 3@d here, pumping the pot to make it tougher on north|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: vulnerable 3 dia is perfekt|pg||
nt|moonbeam42:  They're invulnerable.  Gotta get int here :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: 4@h a chance for E/W|pg||
nt|pelu: pd could have a @H-suit :)|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Because how most play, 2NT & then 3NT=COG=choice of games|pg||
nt|minimeck: will be interesting to see the defense on a possible 3nt by west|pg||
nt|gsper:  Nasty D with that distribution, but what else?|pg||
nt|minimeck: good test here for donati, playing lebensohl a very tough bid even|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ianmcc: likely play in 3|pg||
nt|play4fun55:  isent 6 spade on?|pg||
nt|sybarra: just looking,  can he handle everything?|pg||
nt|minimeck: should be simple to bid this one|pg||
nt|henryb:  May be hard after 3@hX4@h|pg||
nt|minimeck: with a free 4s from partner?|pg||
nt|sybarra: and never mind the vulnerability |pg||
nt|minimeck: but certainly no clear options here, besides a blast, spec offers 5c?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|wiki: par contract / NS can make 2 @S|pg||
nt|bebechira: ace of clubs lead in the open room.... gave the vikings 12 back :(|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Not much of one--a heart suit|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: it shows a distributional hand so pd can act as here well done|pg||
nt|minimeck: max pressure now by Bos, hard for south to restrain himself|pg||
nt|minimeck: the decision by HOP to show a GF hand here paid off|pg||
nt|ady: n/s may play 1NT     may not make|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ianmcc: needs @d lead I fancy|pg||
nt|bebechira: Shane in the tank...good sign or bad sign?|pg||
nt|henryb:  Its not that easy, Matt. Partner's A might be in @h|pg||
nt|minimeck: looking for grand|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|zebutin: well, after @H lead defence was quite badly situationed|pg||
nt|psyck: they did well to x anyway, no so easy here|pg||
nt|zebutin: not many good returns from W|pg||
nt|zebutin: foor = good...|pg||
pc|d2|nt|zebutin: most likely making 10 tricks after finese of @C|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Oh srry, you are right|pg||
nt|galois85:  2@c seems harder with clubs 1-4|pg||
nt|henryb:  But I suppose you have some game ambitions if N has @h|pg||
pc|dK|nt|wiki: and D by S|pg||
nt|minimeck: kib informs me they don't play a typical lebensohl, some sort of relay with 3c showing a minimum w/ 4s|pg||
nt|minimeck: an effective treatment here :)|pg||
nt|ady: 2@C   a better spot   has chances|pg||
pc|d5|nt|runnerup: looks standard +1  if @c switch found -or +2 if not|pg||

pc|hK|nt|bebechira: 11 imps/board... good pace|pg||

nt|janhamhurg: tough x here, suxessfull but not my choice|pg||
nt|minimeck: very agressive x, holding his hand i wouldn't be suprised if they were making slam|pg||
nt|minimeck: alas 3 trump tricks in hearts for EW in the open room, to keep the damage to a probable 2 imps|pg||
nt|ady: good ruffing values in clubs|pg||
pc|h6|nt|zebutin: @S Q is right + @C A right, so this should roll home|pg||

pc|d4|nt|ianmcc: South stays passive, good lead|pg||

nt|vugraphzmy: W has taken A@d before, and after choise @s|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: even playing strong club that is too much|pg||
nt|minimeck: that will give north quite a quandary now|pg||
pc|sK|nt|wiki: in closed somebody was very aggressive N or S not sure which one|pg||
nt|runnerup: normal @s game against 5 in minor 500 or 800 ,but ew not in perhaps|pg||
nt|henryb:  4@s is youthful exuberance|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|nt|psyck: both tables found dbl with South hand, i may not have|pg||
nt|ianmcc: no only 7 but West unhappy|pg||
nt|vugraphzmy: n/s plays polish club|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 3NT likely makes|pg||
nt|ady: diamond lead likely from south hand|pg||
nt|ady: east will try to cash 2 spades and enter west hand with a heart ruff to discard a diamond on K@S   as it can be seen this will not go well|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|zebutin: for other semifinal match http://www.bridgemoscow.ru/tournaments/results/rig11/rig11tmsr.htm for scores|pg||

nt|bebechira: nope|pg||
nt|henryb:  that's good for declarer. He will have to guess well on a low @d shift|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: and then 4 dia, now its ugly|pg||
nt|gsper:  Let's see if that D can scare EW out of 3NT.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|wiki: S should have passed 2 @H  I have decided now|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: the suit is to bad to jump|pg||
pc|h5|nt|wiki: in closed room I mean|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: put the spade jack into the heart suit and all is ok|pg||
nt|minimeck: will have trouble coming home here, couldn't diagnose the spade fit after the jump|pg||
nt|minimeck: and it does indeed, 2 spades should have little trouble but 3nt is ice cold on this layout|pg||
nt|gsper:  Yes! Of course, they might have missed it under their own steam.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|runnerup: 1nt or 2 @h looks ok no more -some opens 1nt -passed-not here|pg||
nt|vugraphzhm: They are playing precision|pg||
nt|minimeck: both both east and west here caught at the top of their range, somewhat difficult to get to game here|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|runnerup: this has no chance|pg||
pc|h6|nt|wiki: it is always more difficult on 2 level|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: well still if north would rebid 3 spades|pg||
nt|minimeck: even guessing the trump suit are still two losers|pg||
nt|minimeck: perhaps north was concerned that 3s was nf|pg||
pc|hT|nt|zebutin: declarer seems to be losing @C, @H and 3@D|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: then they should work on theire system:)|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|penseur9: chances increased by the @C lead :)|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|minimeck: upgrading the west hand to 1nt opener is an option, however|pg||
pc|dK|nt|play4fun55:  I would have opened a 20-22 2 nt in South, but I guess they play 21-22 2 nt ?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|galois85:  double dummy can be done 6@c: take diamond leading with ace, then q@s for the king, club finesse and then a@h and heart finesse, but seeing just 26 cards seems better to ruff an heart for discarding the @d on the @sK...|pg||
pc|d2|nt|runnerup: lead was bad but doent help this ho,e|pg||
nt|zebutin: they have played faster and have only 2 deals left to compare|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|sA|nt|wiki: I think N expected S to have about 18/20 hp|pg||
nt|wiki: now @C and throw @Ss|pg||
nt|moonbeam42:  NS had an unimpeded auction to 6@c in the OR on board 24|pg||
nt|santyclz: N has the right minor suit card.|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s7|nt|santyclz: Except on a @clead if the q is played.|pg||

pc|h4|nt|vdoubleu: Hope we get some swingy hands soon:)|pg||

nt|penseur9: hi Joe|pg||
pc|sT|nt|minimeck: extra undertricks will not end up costing too much here|pg||

pc|c4|nt|santyclz: Gm Andre.|pg||
nt|ianmcc: close to making? picks up anyway|pg||
nt|ianmcc: @c 10 causes problems|pg||
nt|minimeck: other table simply went 1@s 1nt float|pg||
nt|vugraphzmy: difficult to bid 3NT... @d raise is unbiddable|pg||
nt|minimeck: should be able to make 11 tricks now, for an imp|pg||

mb|4S|nt|psyck: lol|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: those boys are hot|pg||
nt|minimeck: Multi 2@d by south here, chance for a small pickup if they put on the brakes here, a pretty decent game, however|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: the 2 teams here are placed 9 and 10 and close til the KO|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Yes, but as we have all seen, a lot can change & usually does.|pg||
mb|p|nt|play4fun55:  yes, 4 h is a nice resting place, but can they get there?|pg||
nt|play4fun55:  2s must show 5+ s & a minor|pg||

nt|minimeck: interesting to see how much upgrading is done by juniors, south decides his 14 is good enough|pg||
nt|ady: 7@S  not much of a save|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: ns can now find @h but is it good ? or will ew play in 2 @s|pg||
pc|s8|nt|wiki: Los Tollos is kind of spanish, but in finnish Tollo is how could I say it nicely, very wise guy maybe even stupid|pg||
nt|zebutin: @S finese is on and that suit is 3-2, so 6@H, 6@S or 6nt seem to be on|pg||
pc|s5|nt|sybarra: we should shout louder for your team Traian |pg||
nt|bebechira: true... louder please|pg||
pc|sA|nt|wiki: not very wise guy |pg||

pc|sJ|pg||
nt|santyclz: N-s are certainly trying.|pg||
nt|penseur9: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzhm: 1D opening is usually 4+ cards in diamonds in an unbal distribution|pg||
nt|minimeck: bold 3@h by bos, but in the end looks to be headed for a push|pg||
pc|s4|nt|zebutin: im predicting 10 tricks, so 130 difference for 4 imps|pg||
nt|minimeck: one of the big benefits of opening NT, make it tough for the opps to come in on alot of hands|pg||
nt|runnerup: sorry youth so at least 3 @s|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|bebechira: we will note score many VPS from this one it seems...|pg||
nt|sybarra: interesting treatment of 3 @S |pg||
nt|minimeck: should have no trouble here to make 420|pg||
nt|sybarra: not every partnership plays this treatment|pg||
nt|henryb:  or even 450|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ady: there is a safety play in diamonds   but I dont think this will make if diamonds are 4-0  even picking the suit up for 1 loser  as would have difficulty  using the hearts|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|runnerup: ns has 7+ tricks in nt -but this looks strange contract and too high|pg||
nt|vugraphzhm: for NS|pg||

nt|ianmcc: X doesn't work|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: every bid was an overbid here so 1 off is the logical result...|pg||

nt|ady: hand 16 Italy played 3NT  when 6@C failed   so Italy gained 13 imps  unfortunate for Turkey|pg||

mb|2H|nt|kaapo:  There's also a play-off for third place going on between Pojat and AV Maria|pg||

mb|4H|nt|wiki: We have some Tuulas friends from Amsterdam here so maybe if you get some results you could tell also those|pg||
nt|henryb:  3 Shirley|pg||
nt|gsper:  Difficult to predict how many tricks in a @D contract.|pg||
nt|minimeck: south has nice hand over unusual 2nt :) indeed only two losers but could declarer handle the 4-0|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: 1@S not alerted? interesting choice with 109x only in @S...|pg||
nt|zebutin: 3nt little lucky, but when @H 4-4 makes|pg||
mb|p|nt|ianmcc: @cQ max|pg||
nt|minimeck: should be a cruise to 4h here|pg||
mb|p|nt|galois85:  must dbl o?|pg||
nt|exerdar: 3c possible too|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|henryb:  14+17 < 33|pg||
pc|sA|nt|wiki: that is normal finnish michaels highest and one of the lower /  2 NT forcing |pg||
nt|sybarra: and basically yuckky with no running suit |pg||
nt|gsper:  If 2NT were of the solid kind, S could have tried 3NT, which may make.|pg||
nt|minimeck: heart lead certainly best, might be able to establish spades|pg||
nt|minimeck: if east covers the jack|pg||
nt|gsper:  I am happy that I don't have to plan the play here.|pg||
nt|ady: 2@H  dubious overcall   1NT  might be better|pg||
pc|s4|nt|runnerup: 4 @h can be beaten 3nt looks ok |pg||
nt|ianmcc: likely to make|pg||
nt|play4fun55:  this will be a close encounter. |pg||
nt|ianmcc: @c9 only chance|pg||
nt|pelu: the transfer overcall can give somme good informations, but also give opp a lot of space and extra bids|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Yes|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|runnerup: even 4 @s down :)|pg||
nt|zebutin: 2@C maybe some gazilli variant, so 2@H denies 8+ or so hcp... |pg||
nt|psyck: EW play strong @c, so no gaz|pg||
nt|vugraphzhm: it is a some kind of gazilli|pg||
nt|psyck: E just tried a tactical approach|pg||
pc|h5|nt|zebutin: 3@C most likely puppet stayman and 3nt denying 4 or 5 card majors|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: well. if the club king was the dia king 6 is easy|pg||
pc|h2|nt|pelu: difficult lead from W|pg||
nt|vugraphzmy: w thought a lot|pg||
nt|pelu: a brave pass after his weak opening|pg||
nt|galois85:  too much values in spades and too less hearts, I agree with david|pg||
pc|hA|nt|penseur9: yes 3nt definitly best contract here|pg||
nt|pelu: not a opening for me|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Yes|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Not the best lead for the defense here.|pg||
nt|minimeck: as cards lie 12 tricks available in the 4-3 fit :)|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|h4|nt|runnerup: if red lead -ruff should be found|pg||
nt|zebutin: good lead, not everyones choice surely to lead from K98x to strong hand|pg||
nt|play4fun55:  j of spade in dummy is a golden card|pg||
nt|minimeck: might need to duck the heart, but that seems a very risky proposition|pg||
pc|c9|nt|runnerup: south declaring it helps|pg||
nt|ady: this should be at least down 1|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ianmcc: he'll likely scramble 8 trix|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|pelu: 1 tricks for S|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: sorry, but i woulnt think about 6 spades at the table so i dont consider it here seeing all the cards:)|pg||
nt|minimeck: as you said, must find something to analyze on a hand like this|pg||
nt|minimeck: but your correct, too often commentators can be unfair looking at all 4|pg||
nt|vugraphzmy: W have shown his distribution after a relay sequence|pg||
nt|minimeck: bos thinking about making a move here perhaps, with distribution shown not the worst hand he could have|pg||
nt|runnerup: entry problems but makes ofcause|pg||
pc|h7|nt|wiki: Linden is sitting like stone I think he moved once in 1973 in bridge table but we were playing night robber that time|pg||
nt|zebutin: with any other lead atleast 10 tricks for declarer|pg||
pc|h6|nt|wiki: and he smiled once in 1984 / he is a real poker face|pg||
nt|kaapo:  I try to fetch the bronze match result also|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: but still east doesnt know about the vasted king of clubs|pg||
nt|minimeck: opposite a min still throws in the towell|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: so after all the choice to pass was  alittle lucky|pg||
nt|ady: diamond switch overtaken  and a trump back |pg||
nt|ady: not easy|pg||
pc|hT|nt|minimeck: indeed, could have been cold if he had the diamond king, decided wasn't going to go fishing for that|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: but a nice system they play|pg||
nt|minimeck: ARG URU will have to regroup after this match, now tetering on the q-zone|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: in nat system you need a jacoby 2 notrump for those hands|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|zebutin: no x, N is just happy that for once opponents are playing in her (?) 6 card suit|pg||
nt|ady: got the right idea|pg||
pc|s2|nt|minimeck: plenty of tricks here, i rekon usa wouldn't mind a few flat boards to walk out with 22 VP|pg||
nt|minimeck: almost impossible to do that in practice, risk going down when normalish breaks can be cold|pg||
pc|s3|nt|penseur9: here we go :)|pg||
nt|minimeck: play should go relatively quickly here|pg||
pc|sK|nt|henryb:  that's actually the wrong way to play hearts with known long spades in East|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|minimeck: will trust pard's carding now for -1|pg||
mc|12|nt|wiki: so S  will be here ok for 2 down I think|pg||

nt|petka: scandinavian style that shows extras with diamond splinter. Hard to stop below 5 if this is such a bid|pg||
nt|minimeck: or not|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|henryb:  Would you raise 2@h to 3 vul, Matt?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|wiki: looks like 5 imps more so 2 imps still and a nice board coming next|pg||
nt|runnerup: ns in bidding and ew quite lazy|pg||
nt|petka: I guess not|pg||
nt|bebechira: 2???????|pg||
nt|sybarra: whoaaaaaaaaaaa |pg||
nt|sybarra: optimism??? |pg||
nt|minimeck: opp my p's 14 16 no, but perhaps|pg||
nt|bebechira: i was thinking flat as 620 flat|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ianmcc: 5 Ok anyway|pg||
nt|play4fun55:  I think they have one loser in every suit in 4h|pg||
nt|play4fun55:  in d even 2|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 2 in @d?|pg||
nt|bebechira: lol|pg||
nt|bebechira: now Pete has to make it|pg||
nt|henryb:  Shirley, you can't (should not) pass partner in a possible 4-2 fit|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Way too high|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: West could have the hand he actually has.|pg||
nt|pelu: 4@S? - I was just between 2@s and 3@S :)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|zebutin: either 5@S or 5@C make, anything over 5@S is little tougher...|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|wiki: we have lost some specs to spingold  /  why |pg||
nt|zebutin: 4@H = 4@S for me...not 4@H...|pg||
nt|ady: I was well out|pg||
pc|c9|nt|zebutin: just say i had couple @H mixed with my @S suit if partner asks...|pg||
nt|psyck: 4@h also ok, helps pd make a choice if opps bid further|pg||
nt|sybarra: I was passing any 2 level bid,  maybe I am the old fogey here|pg||
pc|c8|nt|play4fun55:  2 losers in the d suit|pg||
nt|ianmcc: now 0 in @s|pg||
nt|play4fun55:  true|pg||
nt|play4fun55:  :)|pg||
nt|ianmcc: so this is a good contract but finesses don't work|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Yes|pg||
pc|d4|nt|petka: a popular style is 3C=minimum, 3D=extras with no splinter, 3H=club splinter, 3S=diamond splinter etc|pg||
nt|runnerup: this is 500 agains 3nt =600,but in 5 @c you must quess well|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|zebutin: yes, you are better positioned after 4@H if opponents bid on|pg||
nt|zebutin: on the other hand opponents know more about your hand, which might affect defence...so everything has upside and downside...|pg||
nt|minimeck: cailau decides to call it a day in 3h, will make 4 with the ace of @s luckily onside|pg||
nt|gsper:  I wonder why N did not bid 2NT over 2@S.|pg||
pc|d7|nt|zebutin: most likely defence will take their 2 @H tricks|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: But, maybe Juniors lacking experience get excited when they see a lot of points.|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d2|pc|d3|pg||
nt|wiki: 4 @S is not bad contract but...|pg||
pc|hK|nt|henryb:  You look for a 4-3 major by bidding 2@h over 2@d|pg||
pc|hA|pc|d5|nt|wiki: played by east I think it could be on|pg||
nt|zebutin: and after that declarer just tests spades and clubs and claims|pg||
nt|zebutin: Latvians did well to reach 6@H at deal number 7 on other table too, so no swing for Finland|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|dA|nt|penseur9: this should prove costly for EW|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok sure  and hope he plays 2 @S |pg||
nt|minimeck: we will see how emmons views the south hand, he has been extremely agressive thus far|pg||
pc|s9|nt|play4fun55:  since they use transfers over 1 club, would not a jump to 3 nt by East be a reasonable way of giving W a choice between 3 nt and 4 h ?|pg||
nt|pelu: we are not juniors, Valerie :)|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Which serves them well in other areas of bidding.|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Ni, sigh, unfortunately..|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: No|pg||
pc|h2|nt|santyclz: USA won 4 imps on the 2@S-3 hand when the Italians got x'd in 3@Ds.|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|dK|pc|h5|nt|pelu: @HA and @H = safe for 9, the winning chance is @DKQ stiff, |pg||
pc|h4|nt|minimeck: with 6-4 he wanted to show the clubs, k10 and stiff ace, can't blame him|pg||
nt|ady: this may scrape home with spades 3-3   |pg||
nt|ady: now 9 tricks|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|wiki: no, it cannot be made when @D is singelton |pg||
nt|kaapo:  Last two boards underway. Thanks Wiki for comments (and that no-one called Wiki so that he was free to commentate) and Anni for operating! :)|pg||

nt|runnerup: @d was never even mensioned|pg||
nt|vugraphzhm: EW are playing precision NS are playing natural|pg||
nt|psyck: Auni missed game on board 12, which will narrow gap|pg||
nt|bebechira: yes...thats the question on the lips of the nation|pg||
nt|sybarra: and last hand of this set |pg||
nt|minimeck: will see if harrison is tilted enough to open 2h here :x|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: lol:)|pg||
nt|minimeck: certainly not an auto-1@s at those colors, with only k9xxx|pg||
nt|minimeck: rare to find a junior who passes a 12 count these days|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: here 3 clubs should not make|pg||
nt|minimeck: last board of the set here, a tight match |pg||
nt|minimeck: lunch break for the players after this round, next set scheduled to resume in 1 hour 20 minutes|pg||
nt|gsper:  Seems a quiet board, though I know people who would get too high in @S.|pg||
mb|1H|nt|penseur9: they weren't very "precised" in previous hand :)|pg||
nt|ianmcc: 4@h no good here|pg||
nt|MolvaM: next match starts in 50 minutes. if our commentators are available, pls let me know. thx|pg||
nt|bebechira: ruffing with the ace of hearts was spectacular but inefficient|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: Yes|pg||
nt|minimeck: really? seems 4 for the defense to me|pg||
nt|ady: last hand of the session     thx all thx specs|pg||
nt|moonbeam42:  Another possible slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|minimeck: might just go 1nt float|pg||
nt|runnerup: club lead seems to make problems |pg||
mb|1S|nt|wiki: Paganus already won the Cup of Finland this week so they are hot seniors|pg||
nt|runnerup: looks like 4 @h but ..|pg||
nt|penseur9: easy to get in trouble here|pg||
nt|petka: I am informed that in norway the 2NT response system i outlined is not very popular, so 3S is still an unknown|pg||
mb|p|nt|runnerup: north considering pass/3nt / 4 @h|pg||
mb|2C|nt|penseur9: standings just updated at http://www.bridgemoscow.ru/tournaments/results/rig11/invitational/rig11invr.htm|pg||
nt|psyck: so score difference will be in single digit...|pg||
nt|ianmcc: now that's interesting|pg||
nt|minimeck: club or heart lead best from percario, but 7 tricks all day long either way|pg||
nt|ady: 2@C    showing majors|pg||
nt|ady: 2NT  transfer to diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|zebutin: 2@H seem to be maximum for E/W|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx Henry, Matt and Traian,   |pg||
nt|janhamhurg: right  imeant 130 should not be allowes sorry|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: and of course thx to our operator !  great job |pg||
nt|minimeck: pleasure as always, both USA teams very well positioned out of the gates, the competition will continue to be very stiff at the top of the swiss|pg||
nt|vugraphzmy: ty :)|pg||
nt|minimeck: Fabio will also look to see Italy 1 remain very strong as well :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: Great job Fabio,  we know we will see you through out the week |pg||
nt|exerdar: 2nt lebenshol  >>3@c auto|pg||
nt|ady: or as suggest 2NT  leb  |pg||
nt|runnerup: but all well @h 3-3 and q of @s falling so 6 @s makes|pg||
mb|p|nt|minimeck: (not that he would ever lead a heart) this will give an uptrick for france|pg||
pc|dK|nt|pelu: no p - and if S has to play @D then @D9 well placed for decl|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mrdct: 5@d probably 2 down with no entry to south to take a @d finesse|pg||
nt|exerdar: 3@d now to play|pg||
nt|ady: n/s have 9 tricks in spades|pg||
nt|ady: north will not settle for 3@D   has done well not to get overboard|pg||
pc|d3|nt|wiki: I think Linde can take his 9 so congrats to Paganus again|pg||
nt|ianmcc: open room did well to stop in 3@h|pg||
nt|ianmcc: hi Dave|pg||
nt|mrdct: west may get a @d trick promoted|pg||
nt|moonbeam42:  many relays here after 1@s showed positive hand (GF) with @h|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|zebutin: this doesn't seem to be enough gain still...|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, unfortunately not|pg||
nt|zebutin: sorry 3@H... though 3nt is interesting|pg||
pc|hA|nt|santyclz: Looks like there are 10 winners in @hs, 3 5 1 1. |pg||
nt|santyclz: Actually 11 with the long @h in e.|pg||
nt|psyck: Last deal, finals starting in maybe 15 minutes|pg||
nt|minimeck: hope to see everyone back for the next set, very tight still in the Q zone, should be very exciting!|pg||
nt|gsper:  Can that @D4 have been suit preference, or was it just another card?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mrdct: rock and hard place for declarer here|pg||
nt|minimeck: interesting choice here|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx also specs,  always fun to hear from you |pg||
pc|h5|nt|henryb:  Apparently Japan received a 1 VP penalty at the start of this match - perhaps late arrival at the table?|pg||
nt|vugraphzmy: well|pg||
nt|minimeck: interesting, that would be very suprising to me|pg||
nt|vugraphzmy: 1st round well commented at my table|pg||
nt|minimeck: 1nt, however, can be set :) |pg||
nt|ady: no reason for south to have bid 1 more   has bid his values|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|exerdar: 3clubs and @d  for defance ,game'll go down|pg||
nt|exerdar: for running skores:|pg||
nt|exerdar: http://www.worldbridge.org/tourn/Opatija.11/microSite/RunningScores/ASP/RoundTeamsConditStatClassicMod.asp?qtournid=894|pg||
nt|moonbeam42:  1N was asking about values and 2@c showed min values.  2@d was shape relay, but that's about as much as we know|pg||
nt|moonbeam42:  Oh, well, I guess the operator can fill in details :) and clearly, we dont' know what we're talking about |pg||
nt|vugraphzmy: south know all distribution|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|pc|cT|nt|zebutin: didn't see that one coming, but seems that has 4@H+4@D + couple @S tricks....opponents can take 2@C + 2 aces when ever...|pg||
nt|ianmcc: just 8|pg||
nt|play4fun55:  should just scramble home|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: so some imps back|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mrdct: if he doesn't draw trumps east gets a @c ruff|pg||
nt|vugraphzmy: y|pg||
pc|c2|nt|blum1956: Yes, LAtvia is in 2@s on board 10 which surely makes (@sA lead). Congratulations Latvia!|pg||
nt|psyck: no scope to recover here, so it will be Latvia-Finland final|pg||
nt|blum1956: So Kauko Koistinen - Clas Nyberg (winners of the invitational pairs) and Ugis Jansons (runner-up) secured more medals (this time in teams)|pg||
nt|mrdct: south may have done better to play @c5 to mask east's count|pg||
nt|ianmcc: good|pg||
nt|mrdct: but justin howard has read it|pg||
nt|minimeck: this will make with the club positioning|pg||
pc|c5|nt|wiki: it takes a momen finding clubs 3  0 but  he can do it|pg||

nt|henryb:  I am not fond of Brescoll's auction. 3N over 3@d would seem to be indicated|pg||
nt|exerdar: thx all|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT  went down in OR  on hand 19|pg||
pc|d7|nt|zebutin: wd for E/W|pg||
nt|zebutin: not so easy to stop in 3nt when you have 8 card major fit and 3-1 in other major|pg||
nt|mmmakela: club lead beats 3 nt|pg||
nt|zebutin: yes, not so easy to find one from AQxx though|pg||
nt|zebutin: this table is ready, so thanks for all for watching|pg||
nt|santyclz: In many precision systems when responding to asking bids, you only show ace, k or q as an honor.|pg||
