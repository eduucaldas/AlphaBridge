nt|malipivo:  I am also crossing fingers to Netherlands as Ms. Ticha, a Czech player, is playing there.|pg||
nt|andyv:  3@d may have been a stretch but the double by W is hard one to believe since he can't see too many defensive tricks...almost feel like he meant it as responsive|pg||

pc|d8|pc|dQ|nt|malipivo:  Leading a diamond is difficult for South.|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|toniemme: dalle prime due licite parrebbe chiaro che a Sud piaccia "decidere" i boards in fase licitativa...fortuna vuole che il compagno non abbia 8 o 9 punti..cosa del tutto possibile|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 1NT in OR|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: we have 2 top junior pairs playing here|pg||
pc|h7|nt|xenya: @S switch needed here|pg||
pc|hA|nt|andyv:  5@h can be made as the Ace of @h is stiff and declarer should be able to work out the club situation (E will run out of space to hold too many clubs)|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h3|pg||

nt|malipivo:  They avoided it: 3!nS.|pg||
nt|snigill: a decent hand south has got there|pg||
nt|copeyj: possible 4@S here for N/S - we have all been in worse contracts but with @C 5-1 and trumps 4-1 this doesn't seem to stand much chance|pg||
nt|xenya: yes|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: wild bidding in OR here, EW ending in 6@h|pg||
mb|1D|nt|uni_dennis: NS play 1@S = 0-4@s, 1NT would be 5+@S|pg||
mb|d|nt|kiwibridge: we'll check that score for you|pg||
nt|malipivo:  from spec: 1@S=0-4 @S F1R|pg||
nt|andyv:  E does have an interesting problem here|pg||
nt|the_clown:  would you bid with the E cards?|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: after N opened 3@c|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2H|nt|copeyj: would be nice to be able to bid 3@C invitational 5-5 here I suppose - perhaps this 2@C is gazilli|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|kiwibridge: 1@D = @H|pg||
nt|malipivo:  East is probably considering reopening.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  4@h looks as a make.|pg||
nt|jafa: Important match for both teams, Denmark currently occupy the last qualifying spot (8th) while Australia are in 2nd and within striking distance of the leaders|pg||
nt|andyv:  you hate to sell out, but wrong vul|pg||
nt|the_clown:  I guess 2N is invit+ with 4 card support|pg||
mb|4H|nt|malipivo:  This is going to be a match to be remembered!|pg||
nt|malipivo:  OR: Declarer thinking a lot.|pg||
nt|copeyj: if that is the case then 2@C shows @S/@C 11-15 or any hand 16+|pg||
nt|snigill: 4 spades is a very good contract but...|pg||
nt|nickf: :)|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 1@D 4+, but could be 3 (4432 only i think)|pg||
mb|5D|nt|malipivo:  3@c looked as a fine contract.|pg||
nt|copeyj: and 2@D probably says we are going to game opposite the strong variety|pg||
nt|snigill: bad bridge not to reach there|pg||
nt|the_clown:  and could be based on a very good fit and fewer HCP|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: they found the save against 4@h|pg||
mb|d|nt|toniemme: il contro di nord potrebbe essere ..entrambi i nobili oppure almeno 4 carte di cuori..almeno utilizzando le due più normali accezioni del contro sull'intervento di 1@D..|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: spec says 1@h with 4@h-4@s, so 1@d can be done with 3 in a 4333 (better minor)|pg||
mb|p|nt|uni_dennis: EW can make 3@C|pg||
nt|andyv:  aggressive game will go down....one finesse works, the other doesn't|pg||
mb|p|nt|the_clown:  y W has all the time in the world to switch to a @c|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  Hearts are easily developed here, but transportation is a major problem.|pg||
nt|jafa: Milne will need to switch to a club when in with the AD|pg||
nt|jafa: only one chance|pg||
pc|hA|nt|malipivo:  After two rounds of heart ducking.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  A club ruff would be 4th trick to the defence.|pg||
nt|the_clown:  ah I missed that declarer can get to dummy with a @s ruff|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: though with @c ruff this can be 800|pg||
pc|h9|nt|adonis18:  a monumental earn for the danes:)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|toniemme: 10 assi per il giocante che non avrà problemi nonostante trovi il resto delle @S diviso 4 e 1..|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||

nt|luffe12:  appears that the board was won at other table|pg||
pc|cA|nt|malipivo:  I am counting upto 8 tricks.|pg||
nt|andyv:  so 10 imps on board one to denmark|pg||
pc|c2|nt|hackenbush: if anybody's gonna bid it's West with the stiff diamond and the black suits|pg||
nt|xenya: maybe E was worth a cue  instead of 4@H|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c4|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: not that difficult for E|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: after 3@c by N|pg||
pc|sA|nt|malipivo:  A spade and another room|pg||
nt|malipivo:  So even 3@h might go down.|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s7|pc|s3|pg||
nt|copeyj: this is a slightly fortunate result for China in that you would want to play 4@S I think - but no game makes on this layout|pg||
nt|snigill: should be 7 tricks with this hans south should be more willing to play trumos rather than nt don´t you think?|pg||
nt|snigill: trumps|pg||
nt|cc469: W should not be thinking this long|pg||
nt|luffe12:  odd defense - why not continue clubs right away - nothing runs away|pg||
mc|8|nt|malipivo:  East is defending well, to be fair.|pg||
nt|andyv:  not much left to the hand...@h finesse off|pg||
nt|andyv:  interesting play of 9@c by W...maybe they play MUD in the middle of hand?|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: only 3 down now|pg||
nt|xenya: he has a whale of a hand -- suppose he bids 3@S, then W with Kxxxxx in hearts might cooperate with 4@C|pg||

nt|malipivo:  from spec:|pg||
nt|malipivo:  its wrong score from other room... defence cashed AKS and AK trump out 170 impossible it was 2 down probably so 3 imps|pg||
nt|cc469: partner opened 1NT and with 2 aces S felt he had to double|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: in battle for 8th place Singapore is playing Egypt, so they might score big |pg||
mb|2H!|nt|malipivo:  This is hard to pass or just invite.|pg||
mb|p|nt|toniemme: le francesi tirano fino a 4@S (notare che est decide di licitare le @S..e non le cuori:):)..e 5 punti ci portano a condurre il match..|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Here is a problem, Vugraph operators are making small mistakes not following the plays correctly all the time.|pg||
mb|2S|nt|kiwibridge: the scores are back in sync now the 1st 3 are all flat|pg||
nt|malipivo:  So the score in the scoreboard is usually the right result.|pg||
mb|p|nt|toniemme: on entrambe le sale West interviene con 1SA...leggermente discitibile..si rischia di perdere il fit ideale..|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: thin DBL by E here, but N has too may @hs to pick up something|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 3@c was made on board 3, so 5 imps to NL|pg||
nt|malipivo:  4@h is there|pg||
nt|andyv:  3N seems to be the spot|pg||
mb|3H|nt|malipivo:  The other room is also in 4@s, but from South's side.|pg||
mb|p|nt|jafa: interesting pass by Adam, but 1NT should play well enough|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: and they were only 3VP behind Denmark before this round, so a good result is needed here for Denmark|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|toniemme: nonostante le @S favorevoli non c'è modo di fare più di 9 prese ..come del resto hanno fatto le francesi in sala apeta|pg||
nt|malipivo:  And the majority of hcps is marked.|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: easy 11 tricks|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Board 4: East in 2@c.|pg||
nt|hackenbush: unless diamond lead, but just 1 trick|pg||
nt|malipivo:  It is confusing a lot.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  We were discussing several virtual endgames the other days.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Declarer will go down in 4@h, nothing is working for him.|pg||
mb|p|nt|cc469: 1 down|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: and they are on the right track for that|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  As declarer is missing @d98, yes, exactly.|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|uni_dennis: on @d lead you can pitch the @s loser on the @c|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|malipivo:  The other room in 2@cE.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  It is tempting to be in !n contract E-W, well, East is weak in diamonds and there are no side entries.|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  As a fan to slams, this one is close, but missing two aces.|pg||

nt|malipivo:  They are transferring to a diamond contract. 3@d it is as in the other room (they play it from East hand).|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D!|nt|kiwibridge: looks like 2@C was GF|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: N using 4th suit to make a GF raise in @hs, 3@h over 2@d would be invitational i guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: and 2@H on 5 gives Argentina the 1st imps of the match|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: bd 4 2@c -1 in OR|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 4@C should show @h fit. with @s N can bid 3@s and with @D support he can bid 4@d|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: France in OR also in 6@h after N started with a GF 2NT (3+fit) bid|pg||
mb|4N!|mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|nt|jafa: 9 tricks here if declarer plays on clubs|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 2@h +1 looked a bit strange as well, as declarer still had to lose a trump|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|nt|toniemme: on entrambe le sale sono le francesi ad assumere l'iniziativa...ovest in terza posizione apre leggera e con scarsi requisiti distribuzionali..qui sulla bicolore @D @C sud ripete la ...|pg||
nt|toniemme: quinta di @H...non bellissima ..|pg||
nt|toniemme: avrebbe fatto meglio a passare..talvolta il compagno ha 5 carte di fiori..|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: so the captains have to check the scores after this match|pg||
nt|cc469: good decision by E imo as his hand has no enties for his p in NT|pg||
nt|andyv:  if they bid 7, they  better know a good rabbi|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: in OR South recieved a @d lead, but luckily for Denmark this will always make|pg||
mb|p|nt|jafa: although communications are awkward|pg||
mb|p|nt|uni_dennis: more and more pairs use some sort of relay over a 1M opening|pg||
pc|c8|nt|uni_dennis: would work fine here as N will then here the 2641 shape and then he has a very good slam hand|pg||
pc|cA|nt|malipivo:  It will be interesting to check the results from other tables.|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: but natural bidding works out just fine on this one|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|jafa: if he plays a club to the king and then a diamond to the queen and ace, the defenders would be able to knock out his last entry to hand|pg||
nt|jafa: but with the AD in S, all is well|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|andyv:  I don't have a CC for any of the pairs so I don't know the reason for bidding 2@c instead of 1@h with the N hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  he'll fly with the ace|pg||
nt|andyv:  spec tells me 2@c is game forcing with any hand...thank you|pg||
pc|hK|nt|malipivo:  If I start swapping hands on a deal like this I get a slam or two, but not today? Hm, I am unhappy for time beging. :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|malipivo:  The previous board was an opportunity for both teams, West balanced and 9 hcps could strike harder, I guess.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  There is a potential loser in every suit.|pg||
nt|xenya: Denmark will need to do very well to retain the lead|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 4@h played by S in OR, after N showed 5+@h with 2@c instead of 2@h|pg||
mb|4C|nt|malipivo:  In real bridge finding a King singleton is pretty difficult task.|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  As I see slams everything, this might be one.|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: in N the defense can start with 3 rounds of @s for a @d pitch and then the @D ruff will mean -1|pg||
mb|4H|nt|uni_dennis: in OR 4@h made|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: because it was played by S |pg||

nt|cc469: pretty tough for E to pass 3@S|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: singapore meanwhile 38-0, so 24-6 and they overtook Denmark|pg||
mb|p|nt|uni_dennis: if you don't support, partner does not believe you have fit after 1@h - 1@s // 2m - 2@h|pg||

nt|uni_dennis: looked like -1|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: you always feel you want to bid more if you don't show your 5-5 immediately|pg||
mb|d|nt|jafa: conservative initial pass from North|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|jafa: South want to play 3NT opposite a Diamond stopper, or 4H opposite a 5card heart suit and doubles to get more information|pg||
mb|3N|nt|malipivo:  I must say 3!n is pretty difficult.|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  I am thinking about 3@h.|pg||
nt|cc469: 3@H is a little timid|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: was N doubling for penalties here? South thinking it was take-out?|pg||
mb|p|nt|uni_dennis: take-out DBLs by NS here|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  It happens on this tournament, that vugraph operator makes a mistake and the play is actually different.|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 3NT will go a few off|pg||
pc|s5|nt|hackenbush: he can more comfortably sit this 2@cx|pg||
nt|xenya: this lead might give declarer a chance|pg||
pc|s6|nt|malipivo:  Board 7: now official site is +170 so it seems right 10 imps to argentina|pg||
nt|hackenbush: Hop|pg||
nt|cc469: 4@H by N was an easy bid on this auction|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: or did N know he was making a take-out DBL and thought he had enough to bid 3NT if S bid 3@C|pg||
pc|s3|nt|richardt: suppose it gets home|pg||
pc|s4|pg||

pc|cK|nt|uni_dennis: to make 2@S 3@h 2@D 1@c and maybe another @S|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: or @C|pg||
nt|xenya: N's double looks like cards from out here|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: don't know why E choose @s lead with this @s holding, looks like they agreed never to lead West's suit|pg||

nt|andyv:  Denmark clinging by 3 VPs to the 8th and final qualifying spot|pg||
pc|c3|nt|andyv:  Singapore, which is currently 9th is beating Argentina 45-5 after 8 boards|pg||

pc|h6|pc|c7|pg||

nt|uni_dennis: now 2 more trump tricks|pg||
pc|s2|nt|malipivo:  I will uncover that I am a fan of slams but also of 3!n contract, so I would be fighting in 3!n on this deal, likely going down.|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: if N had cashed before @ds then declarer could have ruffed a @h before exiting in @d, thus losing just 1 trump|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: meanwhile 2@dX was 3 off on bd 6 in OR|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: so 12 imps to Netherlands|pg||

nt|uni_dennis: but i doubt W would lead it|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s8|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: EW could have 'saved' in 4@s, that would only fail on a @c ruff as kib says|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|andyv:  S may have some difficulties with the 4-1 @d break.  He should ruff a @s early for his 10th trick|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|pc|d6|pg||
nt|toniemme: sud scarta la dama per confondere le acque nel saco est avesse la settima a @D non saprebbe chi degli altri due giocatori sia singolo..|pg||
pc|d5|nt|xenya: it doesn't|pg||
pc|d7|nt|toniemme: sud non gioca atout ma è fortunella a non prende la promozione in atout..|pg||

pc|dT|pc|c5|pg||
nt|cc469: I guess he's hoping @HQ is onside|pg||
pc|sK|nt|cc469: blackwood enquiry showed 2 aces without the @HQ|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|pc|s6|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Defence must be careful to cash @cA in time.|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|c3|pc|s7|pc|sT|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Otherwise 3 spades provide enough winners.|pg||
pc|c4|nt|toniemme: speriamo nel claimm..|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c2|nt|uni_dennis: maybe W should have shown a 4-card support instead of a simple raise|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|hT|nt|malipivo:  Well, if it is really 3@d, it shall be doubled.|pg||
nt|xenya: oh yes, it does make, sorry :)|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pc|h2|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|nt|uni_dennis: then E could have bid 4@s with his singleton @h |pg||
pc|cT|nt|malipivo:  3!n might go down on a perfect defence|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: looks like Singapore is going to score the maximum against Egypt and since Denmark got a penalty of 0,5 VP (don't know why) Denmark must score 23-7 in this match|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: so need to win by 31+ imps if i'm correct|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|malipivo:  But doubling is risky as opponents will try to escape or are aware of bad suit breaks.|pg||

nt|uni_dennis: in the youngsters section the next teams will qualify:|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  well, 2@s would be on if it stays this way|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Board 10: 2 imps at stake as 2 overtricks mean 60 points. Players scored maximum in this room.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  In a possible heart slam, defence must cash diamonds soon, as spade finesse (@sT) and also double finesse in clubs (@cQJ) provide enough winners to discard a @d6. Otherwise it would be 6@h+1.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  But this is a theory.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Let's think about 7@dX N-S, how many tricks it would go down?|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: Australia need something now|pg||
nt|toniemme: il 3@D di nord mette sassolini sulla strada licitativa delle nostra..nell'altra sala il barrage dxi passo non ha sortito effetti..|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: Poland, France, Israel, Sweden, USA 1, Australia, England and Italy|pg||
pc|c9|nt|toniemme: non facile per west passare..vero che p non ha fatto cue bid..ma basterebbe avesse picche decenti perché slam non sia disprezzabile..|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 3@C usually 5-5 already, so supporting @c looks best|pg||
nt|malipivo:  If E-W would attack diamonds at every opportunity, @cT might score the 5th trick for defence.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  OR, E-W in 6@h.|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: though there is a battle for 8th between Italy and China (now 4VP the difference half way this set)|pg||

nt|hackenbush: he didn't ask himself which defensive tricks he was planning to take|pg||

pc|h4|nt|toniemme: ora grazie alle fiori favorevoli e alle cuori 44 10 prese sono sul tavolo.....non possiamo lamentarci:):):):)|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: will make 10 tricks now for 2 imps|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|rossoneri:  Any idea how they are going to do the draw for the quarter finals?|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|pg||
nt|toniemme: le avrebbe fatte anche con cuori 5 e 3 dato che NS si aggrappano alle quadri avvinte come edera..|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c3|pc|d2|pc|c7|pg||
nt|andyv:  claim time|pg||
pc|hT|nt|malipivo:  East is considering duck in the endgame.|pg||
pc|h9|nt|malipivo:  If you are using GIB (I am not), it is likely two down.|pg||
pc|hA|pc|c8|pg||
nt|toniemme: forse pareggiamo il board...:):)|pg||
nt|xenya: NS had a pleasant choice between  2@SX  and 3N -- admittedly, neither is too easy to reach |pg||
nt|uni_dennis: for the quarter finals nr.1 can choose from 5-8|pg||

nt|malipivo:  welcome back!|pg||
nt|malipivo:  OR, Board 11, 5@cS=|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: israel currently behind against USA2, so Netherlands are reclaiming the top spot|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|malipivo:  I would call it "phantom endplay".|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 6@h/6@D will make here|pg||
mb|2N|nt|malipivo:  5@hX looked like -3 only|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: australia will finish 3rd |pg||
mb|p|nt|uni_dennis: on a finesse|pg||
nt|malipivo:  a pure slam? nice!|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: probably end up in 5@h after discovering the lack of 2 keycards|pg||
mb|3C|nt|kiwibridge: not much to the play but 14 valuable imps|pg||
nt|andyv:  now only 1 VP seperates Denmark from Singapore which is having it's way with Argentina, 71-5|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: and france or china 4th and 5th, but they probably have to play against each other anyway if nobody picks them|pg||
mb|p|nt|toniemme: urka ..pagata la 1100....se surcontra potremmo pareggiare il board:):)|pg||
nt|toniemme: forse voleva un asso in più per surcontrare???:):)|pg||
nt|malipivo:  or "phantom throw-in" if East really played @dA and another diamond|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|malipivo:  Hm, these are dangerous waters for Argentina.|pg||
nt|hackenbush: need some operator undos here|pg||
nt|malipivo:  operator: it shall be east-west, we believe|pg||
nt|malipivo:  from spec: according to the dutch coach the operators don't speak english and don't understand bridge...|pg||
nt|malipivo:  It remainds me someone I wake up with.|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: my guess is that EW bid this way, so 2@c Drury and E chose not to investigate slam potential|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: and will make 12 tricks or maybe 13 if S doesn't lead @c|pg||
nt|malipivo:  and now it looks we are frozen :(|pg||
nt|malipivo:  The other table is actually running.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  from spec: Operator is trying to lead from the wrong hand:)|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: they are playing bd 10, van Lankveld did indeed bid 3@h after 1@s - pass - to show a 4-card raise in @s |pg||
nt|malipivo:  let's do our homework in the meantime, how many tricks in 4@hN?|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: so they might save in 4@s there or push them up to an interesting 5@h|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: van den Bos already bid 4@s|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: and 5@h by south, dbl by East|pg||
nt|malipivo:  5@cX would be expensive, 7 tricks|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: well, if the dutch juniors don't bid it, it will be a bad contract indeed :)|pg||
nt|malipivo:  yes, undoubled :)|pg||
nt|malipivo:  they have at least one trick in clubs|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 5@hX on bd 10: @d lead, @s switch, now declarer has a chance to ruff 3@D in dummy|pg||
nt|malipivo:  4@hN would be -9, 900, 5@cX -4 for 1100|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: 5@hX was made so 6 imps to Argentina|pg||
nt|malipivo:  that's good news|pg||
nt|malipivo:  According to my experience, this table will crash down and will be reopened. Let's see.|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: in the meantime, let's tell something about the tournament|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|toniemme: ovvio che imtervento di 1sa non sia da fare ..ma qui sono stati commessi errori gravi che anche se non eclatanti come quello di aperta ci costano una tombola..|pg||
mb|p|nt|cc469: 12 tricks available in @Ds or NT|pg||
pc|s3|nt|malipivo:  If you are using older BBO version, there shall be "Movie" button.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  This is not our first timer at this tournament as we see Axx(xx) opposite Kx as a potential for ruffing.|pg||
nt|rossoneri:  USA1 and Italy seem secure in their 6th and 7th spots|pg||
pc|s6|nt|malipivo:  Any voters for 5@c as sacrifice?|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: USA1 and Italy are 6th and 7th, and battle for 8th is between Denmark and Singapore|pg||

pc|h4|pc|c3|nt|malipivo:  even overtaking @dQ with @dK seems reasonable|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: there will be carry-over to the quarter finals|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: depending on the result between the teams in the Round Robin|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|h5|nt|rossoneri:  Will be interesting to see how this affects the decision of the top two teams in selecting their choice of opponents|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: the carry-over is half or one third of the IMPs|pg||

nt|jafa: ; )|pg||
nt|toniemme: qui 3SA meno 3 parrebbe erroraccio invece è frutto di carte avvelenate per la linea EO..|pg||
nt|malipivo:  2@d-4, that's misunderstanding of some king, specs and I have no better explanation|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: transfer|pg||
nt|malipivo:  *kind|pg||
mb|3H|nt|malipivo:  Well, 10 imps to Israel.|pg||
mb|p|nt|uni_dennis: meanwhile we forgot to watch the play, 3N was made in the other room after a @c lead, and 2 off here, so 13 to France|pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  2@D was transfer to @H, east forgot it|pg||
mb|p|nt|uni_dennis: this will be a double partial as 3@h makes|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c2|nt|uni_dennis: but both sides can only go to 5-level|pg||
nt|andyv:  N has a lot of work to do...he may try cashing the A@h, and play a @c to K and ruff a @h|pg||
pc|c8|nt|kiwibridge: all of a sudden we have imps galore and much blood|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thats more like it :)|pg||
nt|jafa: 3NT is the spot here, hopefully Edgtton and Milne are on the same wavelength regarding the 2S bid|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: nice 4@c bid by W here|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|malipivo:  sacrifice at 5th level may be real|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: got them to 5 level, but still an easy make|pg||
nt|andyv:  then he can hope for K@s to be Kx onside or @cs to be 3-3|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|jafa: many pairs play it as a natural shaping out type call, showing 3145 or similar|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s7|pc|s5|pg||

nt|jafa: i don't think Milne expected this|pg||

mb|1S|mb|2C|nt|toniemme: uno slam non brutto...ORRIBILE...il board sarà pareggiato a 3SA e dopo attacco a picche lisciato il giocante farà circa 12 prese:):)|pg||
mb|3H|nt|andyv:  interesting treatment of the majors by W|pg||
nt|jafa: 1S is no 4cM, or 5+D and a strong hand|pg||
mb|3S|nt|uni_dennis: looks like 5@c is a good save for -300|pg||
nt|rossoneri:  hard for N to sacrifice looking at 2 aces and the Q of @H though|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: and could well be 500 or more|pg||
mb|4H|nt|cc469: I find 2NT opener by E unnecessary - |pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: I think we need some undo's|pg||
nt|toniemme: notate come gli interventi in barrage siano una caratteristica tutta francese..le nostre al massimo sbarrano a livello uno..|pg||
nt|christinas:  dangerous board, they might get to 6H!|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|cA|pc|c6|pc|c3|pc|c7|pg||
nt|andyv:  as pointed out by spec, in OR, it looks as if NS went off 1 in 4@s, not 2 if you look at the vugraph movie.|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: so, this will be a push and denmark will need to find 15 imps on the last 2 boards as singapore is on a 25 now|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|nt|toniemme: ora dopo 5 giri di fiori speriamo che ovest legga il finale...un pinto è sempre un punto..!!!:):)|pg||

pc|sQ|pg||
nt|andyv:  informed by kibitzer that 1@s showd @D or a big hand|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|h2|nt|malipivo:  It was useful free finesse as East is marked with longer hearts.|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|h4|pc|c5|pg||
nt|christinas:  it can only make if declarer ruffs 2 diamonds, pitches a diamond and spade on the AK of clubs, plays the K of hearts and guesses to finess the nine|pg||

nt|malipivo:  Let's hope there won't be any slam.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  It shall be not as @sKQ are missing.|pg||
nt|christinas:  Denmark need a big win here. Australia not in trouble, but Denmark play France in the last match and Singapore, who are 9th, play Egypt|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|uni_dennis: 3@h a retransfer, to sign-off in 3@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  and Singapore did blitz Argentina |pg||
mb|p|nt|malipivo:  Even if North is holding @hK, slam is off.|pg||
nt|johnjones:  A diamond lead (or S, and a D shfit) will hold a heart contract to 11 tricks.  |pg||
nt|uni_dennis: even without the @d ruff they can set up a @c for -1|pg||
pc|hA|nt|uni_dennis: good lead this. wow! can give 2 ruffs now|pg||
pc|h3|nt|malipivo:  The fourth diamond won't disapper.|pg||

pc|h5|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|jafa: this lead simplifies things for declarer, but there were always 10 tricks|pg||
nt|malipivo:  spec suggesting there is on endplay on @sK, my next homework|pg||
nt|malipivo:  Nicely stopped at 4th level.|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|nt|STRIK3R: that endplay is given that North play @d finesse and finding KJ double in east before endplaying East on K of @s, possible to do, but not given|pg||
nt|andyv:  with @s suit behaving, declarer will have no trouble on this hand|pg||
nt|christinas:  France lead 22-8 in VPs against Netherland|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|malipivo:  from spec: During this set, it seems that playing with to much relays makes it hard to remember, two big bidding missunderstandings in the other room.|pg||
nt|malipivo:  ruffing a diamond is not helping as @sQ is getting trick anyway|pg||

nt|uni_dennis: for those who just logged in. these juniors aren't really playing this fast|pg||
mb|p|nt|christinas:  But still excitement regarding the top spot. Israel are current leaders, but Australia and Netherlands can challenge their spot|pg||
nt|andyv:  am  VPs1   ISRAEL 3562   NETHERLANDS 3493   AUSTRALIA 3454   FRANCE 3375   CHINA 3276   USA1 3237   ITALY 3068   DENMARK 2919   SINGAPORE 28710   BULGARIA 272    CHINA HONG KONG 27212   USA2 25813   ARGENTINA 25714   CANADA 24415 |pg||

mb|p|pc|c4|nt|malipivo:  Last, but not least, our thanks go to our Vugraph operator!|pg||
nt|christinas:  Denmark and SIngapore are the only competitors for the magic 8th spot|pg||
pc|c2|nt|andyv:  and, as you mentioned, it looks as if Denmark will have the tougher draw in the 19th round|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|toniemme: nord intervianea 2 picche e costringe il livello 3 alle nostre..come in sala aperta..board presumibilmente pareggiato..|pg||

nt|uni_dennis: so this looks like a push board and denmark will fail to qualify for the quarter finals |pg||
mc|10|nt|andyv:  well played on @h suit|pg||
nt|andyv:  N will have to be careful not to squeeze himself on the 4th @h|pg||
nt|pelu:  he has 8 tricks|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Peter!|pg||
nt|pelu:  sorry wrong :)|pg||
nt|christinas:  Denmark will surely lose on this board, but I think he will make 2nt|pg||
nt|andyv:  you came just in time to be wrong...I like that:)|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: choice of opponents will be interesting|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: NL has good results against Italy (+28 imp), USA 1 (+19) and Singapore (+12)|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: so they might choose USA 1 or Italy|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: NL - CHina was -7 so they will not choose china|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: israel scored against Italy (+37), Singapore (+2) and USA 1 (+24) and China (+8)|pg||
nt|rossoneri:  We might have a strange situation of Netherlands and Israel both not picking Singapore....|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: australia will not want to pick China as well (+13), but do want USA 1 (+55) or Singapore (+23), italy (+6)|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: so looks like france - china anyway|pg||
nt|rossoneri:  might see Australia-Singapore then|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: maybe netherlands will pick Singapore anyway, so Australia have to play Italy|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: i actually think netherlands will pick Italy|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: the italian team isn't as strong as in the european champs last year (madala was playing), and good carry-over of 10 imps|pg||
nt|rossoneri:  I'm assuming that the Italians are not going to appeal a decision in yesterday's match vs Singapore, because that might affect Singapore's final placing.|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: i think if they wanted to appeal they should have done so already|pg||
nt|rossoneri:  Long story, but there was a changed ruling and this ruling was delivered this morning, as I was told. Not sure how fast the appeals go through to be heard...|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: ok, i expect: Netherlands - Italy, Israel - Singapore, Australia - USA 1, France - China|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: and if Netherlands can choose for semis as well they pick the winner of australia-USA1|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: in the girls competition Italy hold up in 4th place, so Netherlands, Poland, France and Italy in the semi finals|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: starting on thursday|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: in the youngsters Italy held off China with a good win against israel, so italy 8th there|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: with poland, France, USA1, Sweden, ISrael, Australia and England also qualifying|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: the quarter finals consist of 4 rounds of 14 boards, starting 10.00 local time|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: that is half an hour earlier then we are used to, so we have to wake up even earlier|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: but 2nd session start at 7am CET|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: that's for the dutch, french, italian, polish kibitzers|pg||
nt|uni_dennis: i'm afraid we won't hear the line-up for the quarter finals anytime soon, so bye for now and see you all back tomorrow!|pg||
