nt|sfoxa:  2 more imps in play in this board|pg||
mb|1N|nt|runnerup: 2 top loosers in @d and north bid that suit -still not lead -can cost 2 imps|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3D|nt|santyclz2:  They right-sised it in the other room, didn't get the @d lead.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|tomi2: that contract is both, unlucky and wrongsided|pg||
nt|gluckenval: lead in the partner's suit is a jolly good idea :)|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  (sided)|pg||
mb|4H|nt|psyck: a little offshape, but 1N is the least lie|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|runnerup: 3 @h can be down with @s ruff -3 @d -or 3nt -as looks here has no luck / south -maybe by north -@h lead|pg||
nt|tomi2: he needs to open a sidesuit to try the finesse|pg||
mb|p|nt|wstuart: 1NT is reasonable with the west hand.  Either passing or 1NT could win.|pg||
nt|psyck: unfortunately not the best this particular hand|pg||
nt|wstuart: Those of you who are thinking about 2@C, however, need to rethink;  that would be a clear error.|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, should have 6 decent cards for 2@c|pg||
nt|ritong: fantoni is praying now|pg||
nt|ritong: he s on lead vs NTs|pg||
nt|jacksond: hearts agreed|pg||
nt|runnerup: but looks that west is only asking-so should know to bid 4 @h|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  A lesson here about the value of x'ing artificial bids.|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  We've all seen x's on these auctions even by the person who will be on lead.|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  the worst thing that may happen - EW will play 6@h from E hand and S, hearing partner didn't double 2 @d bids, will lead NOT diamond|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  sorry, no|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Sorry, private.  Does anyone know about the 3/4th place match?|pg||
nt|runnerup: just have to guess if they have agreedeed this till the end -at least some thinking progressing|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|nt|psyck: or 5 very good ones if no other better bid|pg||
pc|s4|nt|sfoxa:  will N keep silence now?|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|Zmud99: Next Match 12.40 : Vainikonis ( Gawris Kowalski Romanski Olanski ) VS White House ( Bertens Bakkeren Jansma Paulissen )|pg||
nt|runnerup: 3. time and still no x|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ritong: now fantoni is sweating|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ritong: but phew|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ritong: 3|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|psyck: NS did well to buy the contract in 3@d after EW found @c fit other room|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cA|nt|psyck: but will lose imps with the result here|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  They don't believe in lead-directing x's.  Partner is supposed to work it out.|pg||
pc|c9|nt|psyck: declarer losing trump control now|pg||
nt|stoffers: Will strugle here, 6 or 7 tricks. @h up then spade best|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|psyck: 10 board matches, next one in about 20 minutes|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|pc|dA|nt|gluckenval: no entries|pg||
nt|stoffers: @d promotes now|pg||
nt|stoffers: If he plays spade now, declearer can play small club in the ending getting a free finesse|pg||
nt|stoffers: So, @d is best|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|gluckenval: Alex found it|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  so, 2 imps go to NS|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|nt|runnerup: ok -at least not vulnerable -so cheaper|pg||
pc|h5|nt|runnerup: wrigth tears of sweat to Nunes|pg||
nt|ritong: fine shot by nunes  worth 2 imps|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|psyck: you can see the team members in the links posted by Wayne above, but we do not have results of other matches at present|pg||
nt|stoffers: Well done|pg||

nt|stoffers: Multon didnt lead partners suit last board, for the cost of 5 imps|pg||
nt|runnerup: no game here either -but 3nt looks starnge versus 4 @h|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|wstuart: Ah, life in the strong @C lane.  Since south is limited to about 16 HCP, he can sytemically open lighter.|pg||
mb|p|pc|sA|pc|s5|pc|s8|pc|s4|pg||
nt|gluckenval: it happens... frequently|pg||
nt|stoffers: Whats the range of 3@h?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  agree, both 3nt and 4@h are down, but heart game looks natural|pg||
pc|hT|nt|sfoxa:  though, declarer still has a lot of problem|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  no entry to the hand for @h finess|pg||
nt|runnerup: 4 solid loosers|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and playing @h from top may help another day, but now it leads to down 2 and one more push|pg||
nt|ritong: and more|pg||
nt|ritong: he knows that east did not underlead @c K|pg||
nt|ritong: dummy's suit|pg||
nt|ritong: so, chances of a singleton are close to 100%|pg||
nt|ritong: except if east has all the remùaining high cards|pg||
nt|ritong: but he passed first|pg||
nt|ritong: so, nhe bnecessarily has a "neutral" lead elsewhere|pg||
nt|ritong: hence, @c = singleton|pg||
nt|ritong: now, perhaps it is right to give @c K immediately|pg||
nt|ritong: in order to limit loss to one down|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sfoxa:  even this way leads to 2 down|pg||
pc|hA|nt|wstuart: East's DBL was responsive, showing values and some of the other suits.  |pg||
nt|runnerup: Welland -team has now got 2 swings -that partial -3 @d here and spades in 10 -otherway other room and where you had 12 in @d by good guesses -5 @d +1 -so White house needs some ...|pg||
nt|runnerup: good |pg||
nt|ybob: hard to defeat , only @D now and later if Q@H duck by S|pg||
nt|ritong: since it is REALLY uneasy to give up that early, it takes ages|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|wstuart: There are some fancy methods here which I bet EW are playing where 2NT byt the t/o DBLer shows exactly 4@H|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s7|pc|sJ|nt|runnerup: defenders has 4 all the time so -i would say difficult to make with only 1 entry to table|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  spade back, as indicated, and push in the board|pg||
pc|sK|pc|c5|pc|h4|nt|wstuart: It is a method I believe was created by Eric Kokish.|pg||

mb|p|mb|2S|nt|stoffers: 3@c is 6+ cards and invitational here|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz2:  Another failing close game.|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  3nt look better than 4@h, if you are going to play the game|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|ritong: this a particularly light 1@h, for them|pg||
nt|ritong: but nunes could not stand 1NT opening|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  this lead brouth a shadow of hope to declarer|pg||
nt|ritong: for those among you who discover fantunes, they have revolutionary ideas about openings|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  2nd time this round Nunes has opened an 11 hcp 1 of a major - have they changed their system?|pg||

nt|stoffers: Maybe even 2, but will get tapped on that lead|pg||

nt|imp_jan: another slam|pg||
nt|imp_jan: missed in the OR|pg||
nt|wstuart: 6@H by *west* is very good.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: they might get to it|pg||
nt|imp_jan: and 6 n|pg||
nt|wstuart: by east is pretty decent|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Now 4 and 3...|pg||
mb|2D|nt|ritong: depends on romanski's decision over 1@h|pg||
nt|imp_jan: not easy to bid though|pg||
nt|ritong: or the equivalent|pg||
nt|stoffers: he shows interest, yes|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  all in all, if NS doesn't go high next door, board  13 is a coffee-board )))|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  here Fantoni did his best to avoid @s guessing|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  experts show themselves in pecularities|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|wstuart: How many @H will he bid?|pg||
nt|ritong: now, good chance|pg||
mb|2H|nt|wstuart: This will likely propel west into bidding some more.|pg||
nt|imp_jan: to be honest, i wld have bid 4@h as well as east ...|pg||
nt|wstuart: I like 4@H - it should show a good distr hand but not particularly strong in HCP (wihch would have started with 2@S).|pg||
nt|imp_jan: exactly|pg||
mb|p|nt|imp_jan: wow|pg||
nt|ritong: well, he has everything to try that|pg||
nt|imp_jan: 4n, whatever that is (RKC?, general slam try?)|pg||
nt|ritong: especially @c KQx|pg||
nt|wstuart: Likely RKC for @H.|pg||
nt|wstuart: East will think his @S void is useful, so will make a response above 5@S|pg||
nt|ritong: he has three keys, otoh|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|wstuart: I don't know what their methods are - typical is 5NT is 2 and 6m is 1.|pg||
mb|p|nt|wstuart: with a void in that suit, but there are many variations which are both reasonable partnership specific.|pg||
nt|imp_jan: amazing 5@S by north btw|pg||
nt|stoffers: Slam makes here, but hard to bid and quite lucky|pg||
nt|runnerup: 4 @s has some play but ,,|pg||
nt|hedyg: precision 2@c= 10-15 5+@c +4M or 6+@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|wstuart: This fits with DOPI - Double = 0,  Pass = 1, 5NT = 2, 6@C = 3, which is what he has.|pg||
nt|stoffers: Would they bid the same way if dubinin had QTxx in @H?|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@d relay|pg||
pc|h9|nt|wstuart: Many pairs choose to play DEPO at 5 of their suit and beyond (D = Even, Pass = Odd)|pg||
nt|imp_jan: wd ew, especially by apolinary kowalski|pg||
nt|Walddk2:  Kras ... found an amazing lead against 4@S in the other room, small club!|pg||
pc|h3|nt|wstuart: Suppose south lead a low @D - would you play low or put up the @DK as declarer?|pg||
nt|santyclz2:  Optomistic invite with all those soft values.|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  Final consists of 3 segments 16 boards each, so 2 last boards of the session|pg||

nt|Walddk2:  1 IMP could be worth 10,000 euro|pg||

mb|p|nt|ritong: nothing good can happen  they are definitely too high|pg||
nt|wstuart: A little too high.  They were getting 6:5 IMP odds on the game, but it requires a good deal more than just a finesse, so it is an odds-off contract.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|s6|pc|s3|nt|imp_jan: it is obvious that ew lack a spade control which explains the lead by noth|pg||

pc|h8|nt|hedyg: 2@d showed @H|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@c= @c|pg||
nt|ritong: and dubinin doubles because of his void plus the ace in case of run to Nts..|pg||
