nt|vugraphpld: Exciting competition between two english teams|pg||
nt|psyck: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphpld: they both play 4 Major and weak NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|2H!|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|ralfwil: Hello Joanna and Krishna|pg||
mb|3H|mb|d|nt|vugraphpld: redouble was alerted but lat either as balanced or transfer hand|pg||
nt|psyck: & which one does he have? :)|pg||
mb|3N|nt|chick: Hello Everyone :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphpld: propably transfer for @C:)|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|ralfwil: an overbid from E in my opinion. 1nt is enough|pg||
nt|vugraphpld: East has alerted the redouble of Partner after 3rd round of bidding|pg||
nt|psyck: they played a relatively more normal transfer bid on 1M-(x) other table|pg||
nt|psyck: agree Ralf|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: but maybe the redouble confused her as much as it did us|pg||
nt|vugraphpld: the standard lead against NT 2nd or 4th|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: and also a danger with that stiff @cA|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cJ|pc|cA|nt|Walddk8: Welcome to David Greenwood|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but cash @cA and play @d8?|pg||
nt|jtr: Hello people|pg||
nt|Walddk8: and Victor Silverstone|pg||
nt|vugraphpld: hello|pg||
nt|odysseus69: hi all|pg||
nt|chick: We're starting out with a straightforward 4@S|pg||
nt|chick: The spade suit is the interesting one here ... declarer needs to guard against QJxx, and that means taking a first round finesse in spades|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c2|nt|ralfwil: helloDavid and Victor|pg||
nt|odysseus69: South better rise on d8|pg||

pc|c4|pc|c8|nt|jtr: Hi guys|pg||
nt|Walddk8: and our lovely operator, Joanna :)|pg||
pc|s7|pc|cT|pg||
nt|odysseus69: easy to duck dQ|pg||
pc|s6|pc|h2|nt|psyck: a less imaginative @dQ than the @d8 as suggested...|pg||
nt|ralfwil: what do you think about @d8 in trick3?|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s4|pg||
pc|c6|pc|h4|pc|s8|pc|cQ|pg||

nt|oliverc: A@D after the A@H and then lead Ace and a small @S. If South wins, more likely to|pg||
nt|oliverc: find the A@C with North and South might have been endplayed anyway|pg||
nt|brotherp: funny result in open room|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello all and welcome back|pg||
nt|psyck: Hello everyone|pg||
mb|p|nt|brotherp: weak nt or maybe upgraded because of the nice features|pg||
nt|brotherp: tactical decision needed by East|pg||
nt|brotherp: 3@d anyone?|pg||
nt|bobholl: marion thinks long :)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: sure...and an unusual aution in other room|pg||
nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
mb|1S|nt|roswolf: a good weak 2?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: good player, though|pg||

nt|peachy: Results website http://www.poznan2011.pl/  where running scores are available.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: part score in clubs best for e/w if they can find it|pg||
mb|3S|nt|brotherp: dbl showing a 4 card major and a longer minor; quite a common treatment in NL|pg||
nt|roswolf: in the slam zone just about|pg||

nt|ady: hi Dan|pg||
nt|djneill:  hi edwin|pg||
pc|h5|nt|roswolf: but 6@C is no thing of beauty |pg||

pc|h7|nt|roswolf: again all very normal|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: pas seems to turn out ok|pg||
nt|brotherp: remarkable decision imo; anyway 2@h will handle nicely also - barring the unfindable trump lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: dicey spade suit |pg||
nt|sybarra: but I would open the hand also |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|roswolf: not really many hands of interest - the dealing computer on strike perhaps!?|pg||
nt|bobholl: paulissen contemplating and still thinking|pg||
nt|roswolf: with no poor breaks any reasonable line works|pg||
nt|roswolf: still he has to plan for a rainy day|pg||
nt|bobholl: he has only 9 tricks if everything breaks without a @D ruff so i guess he'll try that|pg||
nt|bobholl: gib says 11 tricks but he sees 52 cards (just like we :))|pg||
nt|roswolf: probably cdonsidering the diamond guess|pg||
nt|bobholl: meike (wortel) THINKS LONG AND LEADS A @h|pg||
nt|brotherp: excellent lead :>|pg||
nt|sybarra: some jacoby-ish kind of raise |pg||
nt|vugraphpl9: hello|pg||
pc|hK|pg||

pc|d4|nt|stc: yes, many play Stayman in this position|pg||
pc|d2|nt|bobholl: now @H and @D ??|pg||
nt|roswolf: trump now will cause a bit of anguish|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@S prob @C-support, but singleton @DQ?|pg||

pc|dA|nt|Walddk1: You got an e-mail like everyone else. It states  A  closed room|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dJ|nt|bobholl: @C now and another @D ?|pg||
nt|bobholl: he is lucky that the @S 6 is now high enough|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes|pg||
nt|bobholl: will play @C now surely|pg||
nt|bobholl: but if yuo switch @D A and @C Q ??|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|andyv:  operator, are we sure about the @h play?|pg||
nt|Walddk1: THis is match D as stated on the banner|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h8|pc|h2|pc|hA|pg||
nt|roswolf: well i think he is thinking far too much - especially when there is an obvious line|pg||
nt|ady: 2@C  conventional   but naturally west gratefully passed|pg||
pc|s2|nt|roswolf: yes indeed|pg||
nt|peachy: We are all here tp serve the kibitzers so if you have a comment or question, just message one of us|pg||
pc|s4|nt|brotherp: funny position; only 2 more trumps for ew now|pg||

nt|odysseus69: unlucky 6 hearts|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but declarer didn´t take a count when played @hQ. should exit with a small @h for -1|pg||
nt|chick: South is fortunate that the spades split 3-2, otherwise could have lost a spade trick too|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|psyck: good enough slam here needing not much more than @h break|pg||
mb|1N|nt|vugraphpld: pass was changed to 2@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: crikey - Callaghan on the lager again|pg||
mb|2C|nt|psyck: they stopped ealily other table after N's hand was not improved by the splinter|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Brian Callaghan has been playing in his mixed team mode throughout this event|pg||
nt|dburn: but this isn't a deal where he wants to keep the opponents out of slam|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 6nt on N after a @s lead!|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|odysseus69: another way of saying he is bidding on peanuts|pg||
nt|dburn: still, it's hard to keep Mrs P out of things|pg||
nt|dburn: Senior won't think he's being asked to bid six with spade control - just evaluate his hand|pg||
nt|dburn: which is pretty useless in context, given that he doubled at the three level already|pg||
nt|psyck: with his not so great holding in red suits, will pass|pg||
nt|odysseus69: just what Brian Senior wanted t hear- he knows he should bid 6 but will he?|pg||
nt|dburn: he knows he shouldn't bid six - how can he?|pg||
nt|vugraphpld: Brian looks very confused|pg||
nt|vugraphpld: the cards are next to bidding-box now and he looks at the wall:)|pg||
nt|psyck: well 5@h bid should be clear as natural & a slam try|pg||
nt|odysseus69: he has 2 and half goodies|pg||
nt|psyck: hope the paint on the wall dries off soon|pg||
nt|odysseus69: I would expect him to bid 6 - 5H is a very big bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|ralfwil: He can expect a bad split in @h on the bidding. |pg||
nt|vugraphpld: he explained 5@H to EAST as strong hand:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: this auction got awfully high awfully fast|pg||
nt|chick: 6@H had no chance, and 6@S even less |pg||
mb|3N|nt|dburn: just in case East thought it was pre-emptive, perhaps|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|odysseus69: the diamonds split Ok - but its the hearts that matter|pg||
nt|ralfwil: after @cA I think S can make|pg||
nt|dburn: not clear - maybe a club back will leave declarer an entry short|pg||
nt|psyck: not clear how she can avoid 2@h losers|pg||
nt|dburn: she can contrive an endplay in most cases, but I am not sure about all cases|pg||
mb|p|pc|d6|pc|d3|pc|d8|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|odysseus69: lets wait and see- i think can do it now|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h5|pc|hJ|nt|ralfwil: can make now|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dK|pc|d2|nt|ralfwil: nooo|pg||
nt|odysseus69: not now|pg||
nt|dburn: but she ought not to use that club early|pg||

nt|pelu: Hi all - we have a match from Group A, where all 6 teams still can win - there are only 9VP from No 1 (Pony) to No 6|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty Kacper:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: only 50's  |pg||
nt|ady: good score for e/w|pg||
nt|psyck: E has a choice of openintgs|pg||
mb|1S|nt|pelu: spec when West will open 1@s|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is a slam zone hand|pg||
nt|psyck: any level of @s (1/2/3/4) could be right at this vul|pg||
nt|vugraphpl9: running scores http://b.poznan2011.pl/mxt/r16runda1.html|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|bobholl: 3 !! not afraid|pg||
nt|pelu: ok :) wrong - again :(|pg||
nt|andyv:  interesting problem for N|pg||
nt|stc: 12 tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe see another 2 @S here |pg||
nt|psyck: a very light 2@h overcall|pg||
nt|roswolf: so lastarrival is actually 4 imps ahead?|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: final contract prob 5@H|pg||
nt|roswolf: north leaps to what he thinks he can make|pg||
nt|vugraphpl9: running scores http://b.poznan2011.pl/mxt/rrleaderb.html|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes the vul is tempting|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like a routine 4@H |pg||
nt|sybarra: that was certainly optimistic, and probably down an extra in 4 |pg||
nt|fabsayc: slam in hearts will look good till you test trumps|pg||
nt|vugraphpl9: Yes|pg||
mb|3C|nt|roswolf: west might have opened|pg||
nt|roswolf: lots od defence in the east hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  pass probably the right move|pg||
nt|ady: 6@H wrecked by bad trump split|pg||
nt|psyck: N naturally smells slam after that bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: same auction both tables|pg||
nt|brotherp: difficult play hand yet again|pg||
nt|roswolf: south takes the push|pg||
nt|pelu: W sh X on her 2 Aces now|pg||
nt|roswolf: the northpersons will stamp on this now|pg||
nt|andyv:  S has a couple of lines and both work (duck club and, if no @h switch, lead @d or lead @s and use 2nd @s to pitch @d|pg||
nt|vugraphpl9: I have to restart|pg||
mb|4D|nt|Walddk2: South African Texas = hearts|pg||
nt|roswolf: west passing 1@S is optimistic|pg||
nt|roswolf: wow|pg||
mb|d|nt|roswolf: yup boring bd to finish with|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.bridgeguys.com/Conventions/TexasSouthAfrican.html|pg||
nt|psyck: W could bid more , but guess he thought he had a lot of defensive cards too & could maybe bid more later|pg||
nt|roswolf: ty we will need to keep correcting for our specs|pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks a very odd auction|pg||
nt|peachy: The Running Score link also has incorrect halftime score for this match|pg||
mb|4H|nt|pelu: I exp 5-level - wrong - again :(|pg||
nt|stc: with thje 10 @d in NS the slam would be quite fair - how to localize this ??|pg||
nt|oosb: Hi everyone, hi Shirley|pg||
mb|p|nt|brotherp: @c lead more or less kills the defence ...impossible to play the 9  it seems|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: can afford to lose 2 spades it seems|pg||
nt|roswolf: logically should pass now|pg||
nt|psyck: the @s ruff forces 2@h & 1@d losers now|pg||
nt|psyck: on a passive @c lead, dec may have had a chance to lose only 1@h|pg||
mb|4N|nt|pelu: 4-5 defensive tricks and pd did open|pg||
nt|kastan88: Previous board (11) all credits going for Bep Vriend fast 4@H arrival, must be good result for Dutch team, as both 4@S and 5@C are good sacfrifices against 4@H |pg||
nt|xenya: i don't think NS will go any higher or EW will sacrifice in 4@S|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Welcome to Oosman|pg||
nt|mcarroll: the splinter does nothing for N so may dissuade them from slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: are thw men sitting north and west?|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|roswolf: is this the right board?|pg||
nt|peachy: 3D undoubtedly had specific meaning|pg||
nt|peachy: *4@D I meant|pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks a disaster|pg||
mb|5N|nt|stc: 4@s is a bad save|pg||
nt|stc: and they avoided it, wd|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: -1 or -2 |pg||
nt|pelu: 3x@D best defense now|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello Oosman welcome|pg||
nt|oosb: Ive played against EW, a very solid junior pair|pg||
nt|roswolf: will n/s diagnose the situation?|pg||
nt|roswolf: passing now may be the best idea|pg||
nt|peachy: I did not much like 3C, if 11NT was forcing and 3C gameforcing, the way many play|pg||
nt|roswolf: but 4@D looks absurd i would play it as a splinter!!|pg||
nt|peachy: Of course, 3C could have been a more limited bid with 5-5. I am starting to believe it was not GF|pg||
nt|roswolf: ah a spec suggests v4@D was rkcb - that might make more sense|pg||
mb|6C|nt|pelu: down 2 on best defense|pg||
nt|sybarra: this can be beaten |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: need to cash ak in both minors|pg||
nt|sybarra: however |pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: as has been pointed out, easy 12 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: the heart J may worry declarer ..|pg||
nt|brotherp: well the @c lead took care of most problems; on a spade or trump lead this looks like an uphill struggle for declarer|pg||
nt|bobholl: @H 41 may be she thinks|pg||
nt|bobholl: than @DK is needed for 3d @S|pg||
nt|roswolf: north will axe|pg||
nt|roswolf: ok he was just as confused as i|pg||
nt|peachy: Nah, Puerre will be happy with plus if it is coming|pg||

pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|roswolf: on bd 15 the french e/w made 4@S!|pg||
nt|peachy: That was a feat indeed, I thought 3@S was makeable (though it did go down here)|pg||
pc|d9|nt|pelu: ???|pg||
nt|kastan88: Today we broadcast Mixed Teams. 90 teams are divided in groups of 6 and play a complete Round-robin of 10 boards.|pg||
nt|sybarra: with this lead one minor will disappear, |pg||
nt|ady: could be a good score for Duckdates  keeping out of trouble|pg||
nt|roswolf: THEREFORE zIMMERMANN LEAD BY 6 UNOFFICIALLY|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|bobholl: nasty surprise in @H won't make anymore|pg||

nt|ady: club oart score on hand 1 woth 6 imps   2NT down in OR|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: this seems an easy grand to bid|pg||
mb|1C|nt|andyv:  22 was interesting as to what N should do...he passed 4@h but 4@s certainly had some followers|pg||
nt|sybarra: part score battle here |pg||
nt|psyck: 12-14 NT i guess|pg||
nt|psyck: 3N now should end it|pg||
nt|vugraphpl9: Maybe x is penalty?|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: I'll let you announce the actual score every now and then, Geoffrey, so we won't both do it |pg||
mb|2D!|nt|roswolf: strong club in vogue here|pg||
nt|roswolf: no reason not to play in the club partscore|pg||
nt|sybarra: another 2 level contract likely |pg||
nt|vugraphpl9: trapping pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: despite the pre-empt perhaps not:)|pg||
nt|bobholl: 4@C explained as @D better(:)? than 4@D |pg||
nt|roswolf: can west do anything more than raise to 6?|pg||
nt|bobholl: 5@D why not ?|pg||
nt|andyv:  big club fit but 5@c probably won't make|pg||
nt|psyck: true, N had the option for pen x|pg||
mb|2H|nt|pelu: 5@c a nice game - not 3NT|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3nt looks favorite|pg||
nt|roswolf: north playing in 2/3nt would be a travesty|pg||
nt|oosb: even balance of hcp|pg||

nt|vugraphpl9: Of course but...|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Welcome back|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hello to Oliver Clarke|pg||
nt|roswolf: the shown score is wrong - LastArrival lead by 4 imps at halftime|pg||
nt|roswolf: therefore the present unofficial score is +6 to Zimmermann|pg||
mb|3C|nt|roswolf: but what next?|pg||
nt|roswolf: but in a Mixed event i suppose predictable:)|pg||
nt|stc: in fact anyway @c to the A is better|pg||
nt|xenya: 4@S on a @H guess here|pg||
nt|oosb: 3@D for EW seems ok, |pg||
nt|sybarra: first ones to 1 nt |pg||
nt|ady: heart lead will wreck 3NT   kill the entry to clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: east is very minimum|pg||
nt|oliverc: hi everyone|pg||
nt|andyv:  very passive bidding by NS|pg||
nt|kaapo: North didn't have a good opening call|pg||
nt|oosb: this might struggle on @C lead|pg||
mb|3D|nt|bobholl: jan will have to take the risk he daoes|pg||
nt|roswolf: no maybe @C will prevail|pg||
nt|andyv:  no, but did have a reopening dbl|pg||
nt|sybarra: a 2 clubs for n/s played by S |pg||
nt|oosb: I see a lot of tricks for defence|pg||
nt|oosb: correction 3@D had 5 losers, 1@s 1@H 2@C 1@D, so -1|pg||
nt|fabsayc: thinking is overbid|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: and how adventurous does E feel?  (not very)|pg||
mb|5D|nt|roswolf: 3nt from north will put the question to south|pg||
nt|sybarra: wise choice|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: if west is there with a punt - sowhat|pg||
nt|roswolf: well good luck comes to his aid|pg||
nt|oliverc: A fairly predictable final contract|pg||
nt|oliverc: Nothing likely to disturb this|pg||
nt|sybarra: isnt it nice when pard leads your suit? |pg||
mb|p|nt|oliverc: South effectively endplayed on the opening lead|pg||
nt|pelu: no some of the men know the game and can pass :):)|pg||
nt|roswolf: not often though|pg||
nt|kastan88: how high EW going with their hearts 5@H or even 6@H after possible 5@S? NO, just gave up|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: on a @D-lead EW can take the first 7 tricks|pg||
nt|andyv:  anyway, pass probably right as 4@s wont make (5@c was made in OR)|pg||
nt|ady: South has done well to keep out of bidding  |pg||
nt|roswolf: now sfter bd16 +18 to Zimmermann|pg||
pc|s5|nt|roswolf: my first prediction was right|pg||
nt|roswolf: still south may run the club Q|pg||
nt|pelu: why not 3@H by S and not 3@S to tell her hand?|pg||
nt|roswolf: north  i meant|pg||
nt|roswolf: fair comment peter|pg||
nt|pelu: yes but then he sh be in 6@C :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: that's true|pg||
nt|pelu: and on a @S-lead close to make :)|pg||

pc|d2|nt|roswolf: run the queen or play the ace?|pg||
nt|andyv:  in OR, N did open|pg||
nt|kaapo: Yes, 1@D|pg||
nt|oosb: or leads his own suit :)|pg||
pc|d7|nt|roswolf: but bidding a making grand after a preempt is always a good achievemnt so well done|pg||
nt|jtr: Hi guys|pg||
nt|psyck: i thought they may not be playing pen x after weak nt, but pass it stranger if no clear agreement|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|oosb: and happens to find AK with you|pg||
nt|oosb: @h shift after @C for max damage|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|xenya: but 2N can be beaten with careful defence|pg||
nt|fabsayc: why heart 10|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Board 2 NS pushed to 5 @H|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes somewhat self-inflicted|pg||
pc|h5|nt|Walddk4: welcome back to Wiebe de Jong|pg||
nt|pelu: remember the 1@S hand? in OR West open 1@S - and EW in 4@H -3|pg||
nt|roswolf: i like running the queen since opps sometimes dont cover anyway|pg||
nt|xenya: not any longer|pg||
nt|stc: defense had 6 quick tricks but.... |pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure of carding, but udca  just looks like first @D was not correct or not read correctly |pg||

nt|wilkinsona: Hi again|pg||
nt|bobholl: making fun about ducking the @C twice|pg||
nt|oliverc: hi|pg||
nt|andyv:  and despite misguessing the @c, S had enough time to set up @d for @h pitch|pg||
nt|xenya: once E has discarded a club|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|bobholl: good @D switch|pg||
nt|sybarra: and can aford a small @D now|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|jtr: Pushed themselves|pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks doome|pg||
nt|roswolf: doomed|pg||
nt|peachy: heart or spade lead would ket it make, but 100% sure those are not coming from South now|pg||
nt|roswolf: club looks natural|pg||
nt|peachy: so his choice is trump or club|pg||
nt|peachy: *her, it is Sylvie|pg||
pc|hK|nt|roswolf: needs the heart switch - |pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|pc|hA|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm north trying a psychological line|pg||
nt|pelu: Easy for W - he can see the singleton in dummy|pg||
nt|roswolf: now passive defence will win the day|pg||
nt|ady: tht that might happen   unforunate to find such a bad trump split    on a good day 6 makes |pg||
nt|jtr: Well, E/W interfered and South felt she had to show her strength|pg||
nt|roswolf: oh no:(|pg||

nt|andersk: not easy to bid this slam, |pg||

nt|jtr: Horrible hand|pg||

nt|sybarra: think it is |pg||
nt|ady: may get ambitious and look for club slam|pg||

mb|p|nt|brotherp: cruel @d duplication|pg||

nt|roswolf: 12 tricks should be possible now|pg||
nt|roswolf: but not on a club continuation after winning the diamond ace|pg||
nt|psyck: well, not likely to get to 6 anyway, so some game normal|pg||
mb|4H|nt|andyv:  sorry, 9 to france ( was looking at OR results):)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: bidding the liability?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: tricky hand |pg||

nt|sybarra: yeah well sometimes like that |pg||
nt|oosb: @d nice and friendly, @H too|pg||
nt|oosb: But I wouldve passed too, so Sawicka wins imps from me on this one|pg||
nt|sybarra: Kacper,  is S the man or the woman?    |pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: North has nothing much to add|pg||
nt|psyck: hmm, @s's @d's a little too good for 6@d to make|pg||
mb|p|nt|brotherp: impossible @c lead needed it seems|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: chance of a club ruff perhaps|pg||
nt|sybarra: overtake?  and club? |pg||
nt|sybarra: easy for us to see from here|pg||
nt|jtr: Nicely stopped  Not an easy hand at all|pg||

pc|cK|nt|brotherp: even on a d-lead declarer still has a lot of work to do|pg||

nt|ady: part score hand|pg||
mb|2C|nt|sybarra: pard only balanced |pg||
nt|sybarra: its game on a 21 count |pg||
nt|oosb: 4@h and will be over in a jiffy|pg||
nt|sybarra: (combined!) |pg||
nt|psyck: or maybe they play strong NT vul|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: results on http://www.nbbportal.nl/27000/districtscompetitie_2.html|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to another Peter, Goodman from Wales|pg||

nt|petepunt: morning all|pg||
nt|ampelman: 1@c=16+ any|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|brotherp: seems like 4@h made needs some defensive cooperation|pg||
nt|brotherp: which they got in the open room|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: the 4 hearts played elsewhere does not look that attractive|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@H X kostede 800|pg||
nt|jtr: Do they do partscores in Bulgaria?:)|pg||
nt|vugraphpl9: There was no alert|pg||
mb|p|nt|oliverc: no|pg||
mb|3C|nt|roswolf: rehi|pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks a decent slam|pg||
nt|bobholl: For results: http://tinyurl.com/44xdakb   this one shorter?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: 5 diamonds seems ok|pg||
nt|brotherp: 5@d really in the picture now|pg||
nt|pauleger: I won´t raise to 3@c here as well|pg||
nt|pauleger: though partner may have 17 count|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hi all.|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Welcome to Jordan|pg||
nt|granguru:  excellent location of cards for EW|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 @D a transfer |pg||
nt|fabsayc: west timid|pg||
nt|andreasw:  so 2nt min-max ask?|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: a big swing in B3: in OR Fredin-Michielsen stopped in 4@H with 13 tricks from top in 7NT - the problem: a 2@C opening - also calles the "slam-killer" :)|pg||
nt|ampelman: X=points|pg||
nt|pelu: only :)|pg||
nt|peachy: The change in first half score is the result of a TD ruling that went in team Z's favor|pg||
mb|3N|nt|brotherp: well a @c lead would sink 5@d ...and North might have started with @c Ace |pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w seem to have bid recklessly here|pg||
nt|granguru:  cross ruf can produce a lot of tricks|pg||
nt|stc: last making contract|pg||
nt|oosb: close to 6, but no cigar|pg||
nt|vugraphpl9: exactly|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: yes, as spec says ...|pg||
nt|bobholl: 5 @D was the contract to be in but paulissens pass is understandable|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: and another spec points out the attractions of 3N|pg||
nt|bobholl: 5@D goes down also on 3@C |pg||
nt|brotherp: in the end the 4@H contract in the open room was made because North continued spades when in with the @hA|pg||
nt|bobholl: @C disappearing on @D|pg||
nt|brotherp: with South holding 3@d's that was just enough|pg||
nt|petepunt: tough 3rd bid for North,  but 2@H looks better|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Operator, East's name is spelt  Kuzselka|pg||
nt|pelu: there are 12 tricks - but only with @hs 3-3|pg||
nt|granguru:  so a @D lead is this hand demanding|pg||
nt|granguru:  10 tricks|pg||
nt|jcwla: Often the case on a preference auction.|pg||
nt|stc: was 2@s|pg||
nt|ady: might have tried 2NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|stc: over board|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: 6nt likely|pg||
nt|petepunt: 4NT feels the right spot though|pg||
nt|psyck: ya looks like some kind of ask|pg||
nt|psyck: 2N, like 4m, is never to play :)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  :)|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|roswolf: can be made on a minor suit squeeze i think|pg||
nt|roswolf: 5nt pick a slam probably|pg||
nt|bobholl: 6@D easier|pg||
nt|roswolf: might bid a grand i suppose|pg||
nt|kaapo: North may have shown 15-17 NT now, if they play weak NT as seems likely|pg||
nt|andyv:  with no side entries, E might have tried to find partner|pg||
nt|andyv:  with @s suit behaving, declarer should have no problems making contract|pg||
nt|ybob: by any player ,4@C , 3@H at least 1@S ...|pg||
nt|sybarra: well we get to see the play from other side now|pg||
nt|ybob: lead @H|pg||
nt|psyck: i'm told it is a common treatment in France to play 2N as puppet to 3@c with various hands & 3N rebid showed 4@d & short @c|pg||
pc|s3|nt|roswolf: this is more gentle|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes think it will be 10 of ht lead|pg||
nt|ybob: only lost if play @D to A at trick 2|pg||
pc|s5|nt|pauleger: wonder why N puts in @s4 with nothing in @d|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|kaapo: And the diamond suit is also behaving for the declarer|pg||
nt|oosb: Although its right sided now|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 @S cue |pg||
nt|sybarra: or forcing or whatever you want to call it |pg||
nt|sybarra: she is bold,  (we have seen)  does she bid it?|pg||
nt|oosb: So if they end up in 6@H itll make, (defence cant mangae @s ruff or @c tricks)|pg||
nt|oosb: known 9 card fit|pg||
nt|peachy: TD = Tournament Director|pg||
pc|c5|nt|roswolf: 7@D CAN be made by the backward finesse in trumps which pins the 10 +9|pg||
nt|roswolf: hardly likely though unless south shows his hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: this may be a long think|pg||
nt|bobholl: it is and understandable :)|pg||
nt|bobholl: s said he'll ask what he shows afterwards :)|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ampelman: 3NT seems to have 8 tricks on the first look|pg||
nt|oosb: Disciplined pass|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes and wins in the long run |pg||
pc|cA|nt|pelu: game need @DA + @SQ in S , so nice stop by EW|pg||
nt|granguru:  Declarer can try for 11 playing @h first but he risks a @D rerturn|pg||
nt|sybarra: just this hand it doesnt  |pg||
nt|ady: 3@C makes e/w|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|sybarra: oops |pg||
nt|ybob: danger now :(|pg||
pc|h9|nt|roswolf: this will take some time to play|pg||
pc|hT|nt|bobholl: can be made after giving up 1@H and than a @D @C squeeze on n|pg||
nt|granguru:  return*|pg||
nt|vugraphpl9: misunderstanding about 3@C - N said is automatic.|pg||
nt|vugraphpl9: S forgot it.|pg||
pc|hK|nt|oliverc: I have to go. Thanks everyone|pg||
nt|ybob: he doesn´t  hear me |pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|xenya: it looks as if either W doesn't have the 3@S bid or E the raise |pg||
pc|cT|nt|ybob: another @H|pg||
nt|sybarra: speak louder :)|pg||
nt|ybob: 10 @S is bad return|pg||
nt|vugraphpl9: quick claim|pg||
nt|vugraphpl9: And talk about the auction|pg||
pc|c3|nt|petepunt: usefull to play 4n as quant after going through 4th suit as many othet forcing bids avail|pg||
nt|oosb: Cant play with a KC and Q@H missing, pass will win in the long run|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|stc: a good observation from specs : penalty X not allowed in Mixte|pg||
mc|12|nt|roswolf: i am sure declarer will ultimately play for the squeeze|pg||

nt|andersk: and 6 NT is actually much better (tx Ulf)|pg||
nt|andersk: :)|pg||
nt|chick: 6N requires only that either of the majors splits reasonably enough for 5 tricks.  In trump, if the trump suit splits badly, you are down.  In NT, you just try the other suit ...|pg||
nt|chick: instead.|pg||
mb|p|nt|psyck: yes, I guess a major lead was not tempting though E denied majors|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a passive lead after this bidding|pg||

nt|vugraphpl9: running scores http://b.poznan2011.pl/mxt/swleaderb.html|pg||

nt|oosb: I guess it showed both majors??|pg||
nt|vugraphpl9: To KO stage goes 27 teams from A and 5 from B|pg||
nt|mcarroll: the 1@S bid may keep the opps out of the 24 point gamble on 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|pauleger: Willard: http://www.eurobridge.org/scripts/person.asp?qryid=3855|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes this will end up in game i fancy|pg||
nt|pelu: DD u can make 3NT on a @S-lead - but ...:(|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is thin in the extreme and probably needs to guess the hearts which i think is highly unlikely|pg||
nt|pelu: agree |pg||
nt|stc: and considering to bid 3 !|pg||
nt|ybob: lead @H to limited 10 tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: not a fan of 3 @S either but not sure of their methods|pg||
nt|ybob: underlead a@C later to  E and ruff @H return|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no tricks in no trump|pg||
nt|peachy: EW will do well to take a plus here now that the diamond lead has been found by NS and 3NT becomes "out of the question"|pg||
pc|cK|nt|Walddk4: running scores at  http://r.poznan2011.pl/mxt/rrleaderb.html|pg||
nt|ampelman: should make|pg||
nt|granguru:  excellent bid by NS|pg||
nt|ady: no good played by east|pg||
nt|psyck: 6@s should be reached in comfort as they have enough extras|pg||
pc|c2|nt|granguru:  @H ruff is already establish with the lead|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ampelman: losing 1@h 1@c 2@d|pg||
nt|pauleger: Zimmermann: http://www.eurobridge.org/scripts/person.asp?qryid=4458|pg||
nt|granguru:  established*|pg||
nt|kaapo: Well, the rest of the bidding looks rather odd|pg||
nt|jtr: They did  Well done|pg||
nt|jtr: Now to make it|pg||
nt|mcarroll: best spot for  EW|pg||
nt|psyck: NT has additional chances with red suit breaks|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|petepunt: East suspects the 4-3 fit :)|pg||
nt|kaapo: This lead might help quite a lot|pg||
nt|andyv:  and may have been reason not to bid 2@d (if that weren't conventional)|pg||
nt|kaapo: Will defence find their @S tricks?|pg||
nt|andyv:  but S's first bid seemed to be 1N so they must have some system nuances that we aren't aware of|pg||
nt|stc: a good lead|pg||
nt|xenya: note the cautious 2N by W -- apparently he has seen partner's openings before |pg||
nt|fabsayc: best but probably down also|pg||
pc|s7|nt|roswolf: hmm n/s didnt even try for the slam bonus|pg||
nt|ewj: I|pg||
nt|petepunt: lot to do here.|pg||
nt|ady: contract may depend on heart guess  |pg||
nt|psyck: 6@c odd key cards with a void|pg||
nt|vugraphpl9: N seems to be surprised|pg||
pc|s5|nt|bobholl: in this bidding the critical singleton @C is not shown|pg||
pc|sK|nt|andyv:  to induce E to continue @ds|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|ady: will struggle |pg||
nt|jtr: North starting well by concealing the @sQ|pg||
pc|sA|nt|granguru:  declarer will soon claim 10 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphpl9: N: We have no agreement|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|nt|bobholl: he claims with beer card as the last one @D7|pg||
nt|vugraphzhd: Small break now|pg||
nt|vugraphzhd: Standings after 10 of 22 rounds: 1st: Drijver Brink +72 2nd Schollaardt-wortel +42 3rd Jansma-Paulissen +27 4th Cornellisse Krijgsman +23|pg||
nt|kaapo: Well, hard for east to attack spades|pg||
nt|andyv:  and now it doesn't matter|pg||
nt|sybarra: almost only hope |pg||
nt|ybob: not neccesary played 10 °@H , declarers can play it later|pg||
nt|psyck: not a good idea to bid 6@c then, with no agreement N is in the dark about the number of key cards|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes poor judgment not to show it|pg||
nt|stc: 9@s not best idea|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Welcome to Hedy Grey|pg||
nt|hedyg: hi :)|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Hedy|pg||
nt|oosb: well done agian|pg||
nt|fabsayc: that wont fool declarer|pg||
nt|fabsayc: q10x lead of ten not realistic|pg||
nt|jtr: North did not know that|pg||
nt|mcarroll: It may have - and encouraged the @H misguess|pg||
pc|c7|nt|petepunt: He needs to play N for the AJ@S for many reasons|pg||
nt|granguru:  now @S is a better discard...just in case Mass|pg||
nt|granguru:  Maas is permitted to ruff twice in dummy|pg||
nt|stc: salut|pg||
nt|vugraphpl9: Now they have :)|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cT|nt|andyv:  and a big swing for Denmark|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|ady: east has 9@S    10@S  led    surely not from Q10X|pg||
nt|jtr: Q108 it is the right card|pg||
nt|mcarroll: True  - in which case the @H play is puzzling|pg||
nt|fabsayc: in any case he now has pitches for club loser|pg||
pc|hK|nt|granguru:  only 10 tricks again|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h8|nt|petepunt: SHe has started very well here :)|pg||
nt|pauleger: ducking the first @h seems better, if East has an entry in @c|pg||
nt|ady: chance with both hearts good|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|stc: surprise, surprise|pg||
pc|s3|nt|pelu: now W can claim|pg||
nt|pelu: E :)|pg||
nt|vugraphpl9: and she did|pg||
nt|ybob: now declarers could be lost if E had 10xx @S and 2 @C|pg||
pc|s9|nt|petepunt: but bad @C break will not be good news|pg||
pc|d4|nt|roswolf: this looks -2 which wont be sufficient compensation for the opposing game|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|jtr: Nice|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|pauleger: then you only got 3@c2@d2@h tricks|pg||
mc|7|nt|petepunt: have to setle for 2 off now|pg||

nt|andyv:  in OR, W led a @h vs. 1NT and S had to attack @ds |pg||
nt|vugraphpl9: Multon calls TD|pg||
nt|andyv:  EW don't quite have a stopper in @hs|pg||
nt|andyv:  I wonder if it's in regards to the 2@c bid|pg||
nt|kaapo: Perhaps there were different explanations|pg||
nt|kaapo: But we'll what's going on I'm sure|pg||
nt|ady: good score for Penfold|pg||
nt|jtr: She had it made if trumps were 3-2 so did very well to get that right|pg||
nt|roswolf: 53-19 to team Z unofficially|pg||
nt|peachy: This hand a good example of effectiveness of lead directing overcalls|pg||
mb|1C|nt|xenya: how's that?|pg||
nt|ybob: by E|pg||
mb|d|nt|roswolf: leaping michaels would have been handy here|pg||

nt|vugraphpl9: He did.|pg||
nt|hedyg: hey Kacper :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: if it was -1 could you pls correct the score?|pg||
nt|vugraphpl9: it was to fast for me...|pg||
nt|ybob: p 1@S|pg||
nt|andreasw:  3-4@s by e-w seems like ending cotract?|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: they dont come without risk, of course, but in my opinion they are a long term winner|pg||
mb|1S|nt|roswolf: a hand where you dont want to be declarer|pg||
nt|pauleger: 1@d shows @hs|pg||
nt|pelu: what will Gunn Heolness bbid now?|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@C by east would have delighted west more|pg||

nt|roswolf: true|pg||
mb|p|nt|ybob: operator ?|pg||
nt|sybarra: here we go|pg||
nt|psyck: E will have more ambitions than a partial|pg||
mb|2S|nt|vugraphpl9: sorry :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@S E/W HAS PRACTICAL CHANCES|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: look at the @S-suit - against 4@h S lead @SK - and N took @SA to play @H = only 3 @S-losers for E|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@D or 2@C by West - I prefer 2@c|pg||
nt|ybob: np :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: for new players,  note the play of trumps,  cashing ace in case an honor drops singleton |pg||
nt|ady: e/w need to stay in 1NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|brotherp: ns are playing some kind of strong club|pg||
nt|kaapo: EW have many possible games here. 3NT was one of the unlucky ones|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx Kacper for all of your hard work |pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: This should go down a couple.|pg||
nt|sybarra: 5 @C great contract |pg||
nt|oosb: Must play 5@D or 5@C|pg||
nt|jtr: Another awkward hand to play|pg||
pc|s6|nt|roswolf: this is a horror hand for e/w to bid|pg||
nt|roswolf: well west should bid 6!?|pg||
nt|sybarra: no 3 nt without ht stop |pg||
pc|s4|nt|sybarra: but must avoid 6  of minor|pg||
nt|ady: need to initially play on clubs|pg||
nt|fabsayc: club 8 or 9?|pg||
nt|andreasw:  @s q well placed for 10 tricks tho|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|roswolf: winning the auction might work out very well anyway|pg||
nt|sybarra: this will be a challenge|pg||
nt|ybob: defeat easy|pg||
nt|psyck: but getting to hand for @s fin not easy|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|pelu: in OR 2@C and then 2@S = 4. suit - so the NS didnt know the @S-suit by decl|pg||
nt|roswolf: you should as west be able to bid 3@D nf here|pg||
nt|pauleger: I would expect more points or more shape for a 2@s bid|pg||
nt|granguru:  8 tricks for a coorect defense|pg||
nt|granguru:  correct* damn|pg||
pc|h5|nt|bobholl: he showed 5@H 4@D and a minimum|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@S is winning place|pg||
nt|ampelman: losing 2@s 2@c 1@d ?|pg||
nt|pelu: 4 black losers|pg||
nt|oosb: yes, but a very good auction so far|pg||
nt|psyck: wonder if will try @s or @h from dummy|pg||
pc|hA|nt|bobholl: tricky play |pg||
nt|bobholl: with 52 cards open not difficult but |pg||
nt|brotherp: best lead|pg||
nt|bobholl: jansma does that (too) often :)|pg||
nt|petepunt: may even lead @H here|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes that is as maybe but a 6-0 fit is usually to be avoided|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 @D = cue at this point |pg||
nt|oosb: 5@C coming up|pg||
pc|h6|nt|wilkinsona: plenty of chances though|pg||
nt|petepunt: @C suit is interesting here|pg||
nt|andyv:  5@c not that easy so 4@c should net EW a plus|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|kaapo: 2@D was some variant of multi, showing a weak hand with long major (possibly with other options)|pg||
nt|kaapo: 3@H showing some support for both majors|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes, and 3@h was p/c|pg||
pc|s7|nt|brotherp: think Verhees will play West for the @dJ...keeping the dangerous hand of lead|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: looks logical|pg||
nt|bobholl: but how to cross ? open up the @H for defenders ?|pg||
nt|kaapo: True, @C 4-1 makes life much harder|pg||
nt|andyv:  some play that as invite in @s and some play it as furthering the preempt|pg||
nt|hedyg: no 5@c bid from E, worried about pushing opps to slam?|pg||
nt|sybarra: and W hitting the deck |pg||
pc|sA|nt|oosb: Excellent|pg||
nt|sybarra: no ht cue,   |pg||
nt|sybarra: this will not take long either |pg||
pc|h2|nt|psyck: @c too risky, i'd have tried @h|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm not an expected switch|pg||
nt|sybarra: great auction  |pg||
pc|sK|pc|h4|nt|psyck: now 1@h, 1@s, 4@c losers with dummy dead|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s9|pg||

pc|hT|nt|roswolf: yes he needs to st up the side suit|pg||

pc|h9|nt|petepunt: will need to use a little deception to make this one|pg||
nt|psyck: @d now i guess|pg||
pc|c7|nt|granguru:  -1 now|pg||
nt|ybob: j @D ?|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|pauleger: W may try an elimination|pg||
pc|hK|pc|cT|nt|brotherp: only some ego-points to be won by divining the black suit distribution now|pg||
pc|c3|nt|granguru:  no -22|pg||
nt|hedyg: could have made 12 tricks here|pg||
nt|sybarra: or heart, heart?|pg||
nt|sybarra: and count by S  (showing 5 card)  hence the switch |pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is now straightforward|pg||
nt|granguru:  -2|pg||
nt|andyv:  here the 2@d opener made playing the @c suit easier|pg||

nt|ady: looks ok with clubs behaving and K@D onside|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|andyv:  inspiration|pg||

nt|kaapo: Trying to make up for board 26 perhaps|pg||
pc|cT|nt|granguru:  if N ducks @D once there is no hope to win the hand|pg||
nt|jcwla: A good hand to be playing invitational 3@D over 1@H.|pg||
nt|ady: could be a good score if e/w land in the right spot|pg||
pc|cA|nt|bobholl: 3nt a good save against 4@S funny :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup bridge is a strange but wondrous game|pg||
nt|bobholl: on a @H lead anyway :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: Or 1NT forcing followed by a @D rebid.|pg||
nt|sybarra: that seems better |pg||
nt|sybarra: so how do we feel about j of @D  lead?|pg||
nt|sybarra: unlikely to see |pg||
nt|oosb: would be brilliant|pg||
nt|oosb: but Q@C more likely than @d, if its non @H at all|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree|pg||
nt|oosb: however, could East have bid 2@D when pd anti dbled?|pg||
nt|sybarra: j of @D throws hand into a cocked hat |pg||
nt|oosb: I guess not, since you dont want to end up in 2@H X|pg||
nt|oosb: would still make though|pg||
nt|sybarra: I would not bd 2 @H,  could be 5 on my left|pg||
nt|oosb: agreed|pg||
nt|sybarra: and my right opened |pg||
nt|sybarra: makes me shiver |pg||
nt|oosb: Perhaps N also confused about the 2@H and 3@H bids|pg||
nt|oosb: (I am)|pg||
nt|psyck: dec can give up a @s, draw trumps & claim|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ampelman: 5@d looks fine|pg||
nt|pelu: for sure no X - %@D making easy|pg||
nt|pelu: 5@d|pg||
nt|jtr: Well done|pg||
nt|ady: well done|pg||
nt|fabsayc: only worked because west overstrength|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|oosb: Sawicka was really trying to get Kx to bid 3NT maybe|pg||
nt|sybarra: her name looks like the expensive crystal  yes? no?|pg||
nt|sybarra: E name I mean |pg||
pc|s2|nt|bobholl: nice balance from gert jan (paulissen)|pg||
nt|brotherp: still Paulissen is there so EW reach their part-score in clubs|pg||
nt|granguru:  some 2/1 players changed system in such a way that a repeat of the same suit as here is no more GF|pg||
nt|kaapo: 4 spades, 2 clubs, 2 diamonds and a heart would be 9|pg||
nt|ybob: @D lead = 10 TRICKS|pg||
nt|sybarra: N just not defending with void |pg||
nt|sybarra: God gave you singletons to lead right?|pg||
nt|jtr: Yes discounted the vital @dK|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ybob: :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  or the @hJ|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|bobholl: but i saw 2nt as balance (may be wrong)|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|sybarra: so "we" will play this moysian |pg||
nt|oosb: Swarovski?|pg||
nt|oosb: kind of :)|pg||
pc|c9|nt|jcwla: Another workable treatment here.|pg||
nt|sybarra: now we see a H! lead |pg||
pc|cK|nt|pauleger: W will have to exit somewhere now|pg||
nt|andreasw:  about to claim :)|pg||
pc|c8|pc|h3|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes  thx all,  |pg||
nt|sybarra: N hiding the 2 |pg||
pc|s4|nt|henryb:  Hard for allerton to place partner with a stiff club|pg||
pc|c5|nt|granguru:  defense is giving some help|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
nt|xenya: so EW have got to best strain here, but as Hedy said, they were always in the position to do so, even if E had passed 3rd in hand |pg||
pc|d2|nt|ybob: can lead fron QXX @C ???|pg||
nt|henryb:  Leslie needs to lead a heart now to beat this|pg||
nt|sybarra: is it that difficult?  leading an "odd ball" suit |pg||
nt|ybob: from|pg||
pc|d3|nt|brotherp: Jansma doesnt know trumps are 2-2 so looking for the best way to play diamonds|pg||
nt|psyck: all lines work, @c ruffs or giving up a @s or whatever|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|s5|nt|roswolf: east will be squeezed for the overtrick|pg||
nt|pelu: only down 1 in 4@h = 11 for Norway|pg||
pc|s8|pc|c3|pg||
nt|oosb: Connector picked up 10 whole imps for their elegant auction|pg||
nt|vugraphpl9: UDCA so doesn't matter|pg||
nt|vugraphpl9: I think :)|pg||
nt|oosb: And will get more here I predict|pg||
pc|sT|nt|granguru:  now the second @D permits to re-enter dummy |pg||
pc|s6|nt|andyv:  really?|pg||
nt|vugraphpl9: yes|pg||
pc|h4|nt|oosb: E can just sit back and guard @D now, its all she has! |pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|granguru:  but declarer went for the finesse that didnt work|pg||
nt|andyv:  so W may be relying on bringing in the @h suit|pg||
pc|d7|nt|pelu: so "only" down 1|pg||
nt|henryb:  no, I guess they still get a heart|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dA|nt|andyv:  I don't understand putting not putting the J@c in.  It seemed like a no cost play|pg||
nt|andyv:  sorry, NOT putting:)|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|d5|nt|bobholl: now N thinks he's endplayed :)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|vugraphzhd: A very short break now|pg||
nt|roswolf: east letting a club go early|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d9|pg||
nt|granguru:  as he/she could make just 1 @H finesse |pg||
nt|andyv:  so declare was relying on the @h suit...and 7 imps to Zimmermann|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d6|pc|cJ|pc|dT|pg||
pc|h2|nt|roswolf: but declarer should read the position easily|pg||

nt|petepunt: this has been a good come back by fredins team here|pg||
nt|pelu: a biddinbg misunderstand - and unlucky lead chanced 650 to 1090|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm not sure east would take out if west stood it - a golden rule seems to be to leave such decisions to the better player(ahem ie the man):)|pg||
nt|pauleger: Team Langer closing the gap|pg||
nt|kaapo: Well, that's one way :)|pg||
nt|stc: Some swing potential here|pg||
nt|ady: hand 6   where east did well to make 3@D    3NT made in OR|pg||
nt|vugraphpl9: short break|pg||
nt|roswolf: 55-19 unofficially|pg||
mb|1S|nt|roswolf: this is a bits and pieces hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: more distribution|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|roswolf: this is a Mixed Competition and it has its own dynamics|pg||
nt|pelu: remember Board 17, where u would like W to bid 3@D NF - W in OR could that and are npw playing a hopeless 3@D|pg||
nt|granguru:  hand 17 should give some to Jankova|pg||
mb|p|nt|pauleger: E has a normal pass, but E/W are cold for 3NT|pg||
nt|pauleger: good hand for 2 suiters even with 5-4|pg||
nt|kaapo: He could also play @H to J, cash spade and end play south|pg||
nt|andyv:  3@c some type of constructive raise|pg||
nt|stc: or a flat 4@h ?|pg||
nt|oosb: this will cause more problems for W |pg||
nt|oosb: but Piotr passes smoothly|pg||
mb|2H|nt|brotherp: precision 1@d|pg||
nt|roswolf: well a direct raise to game isnt stupid|pg||
nt|pelu: I have been told that 1-3 from the group go to A-swiss and 4-6 to B-swiss, then 27 from A and 5 from B to Knock-out - is that correct??|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: that sounds usual|pg||
nt|vugraphpl9: Yes|pg||
nt|pelu: wild cards in this sektion|pg||
nt|vugraphpl9: running scores http://b.poznan2011.pl/mxt/rrleaderb.html|pg||
nt|roswolf: the limit for both sides is the 5 level|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 nt now in other room a bit agressive|pg||
nt|petergill: Steph Jacob is playing with her son Nick. At the other table, Tom Jacob is playing with Susan Humphries. All are from Auckland. Nick and Susan are youth players in their early ...|pg||
nt|petergill: twenties.  |pg||
nt|ybob: very nice :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: nah just pass |pg||
mb|3N|nt|brotherp: asking 2@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobholl: spades a bit unpretty|pg||
nt|pelu: the key-pælay in 4@s in OR was in trick 3 - after 2x@S N played @h7 - and @HK from East - all over|pg||
nt|roswolf: north really cant bid more|pg||
nt|jcwla: I don't know what the 2NT range is but a queen and a jack opposite a big hand is going to play about as well as one would expect it would.|pg||
nt|andreasw:  alot of possible games to end p in here but 3nt likely|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  very difficult not to make 5 on this hand|pg||
nt|oosb: run of @d will hurt West|pg||
nt|sybarra: must say, imo,  the ladies have been the agressive ones at this table |pg||
nt|oosb: and the guys have been very composed :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes|pg||
nt|oosb: interesting hand this one|pg||
nt|sybarra: may used to their ladies |pg||
nt|sybarra: *maybe|pg||
nt|fabsayc: auction mysterious on that board|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: the rebidable singleton..|pg||
nt|ady: something to spare here wven with 4-0 spade split|pg||
nt|fabsayc: ruff two clubs, lose two trumps, not much of interest here|pg||
nt|jtr: Worried about entering hand maybe|pg||
pc|s5|nt|roswolf: the vul sac in 6@DX was very tough to find|pg||
nt|pelu: so 6@d x is the par-contract|pg||
nt|vugraphpl9: \|pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks an uphill struggle|pg||
pc|sA|nt|pelu: wrong Q by N :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: this should be ok|pg||
nt|granguru:  E should have asked Stayman or just passed|pg||
nt|ybob: nice spot 3@D|pg||
nt|sybarra: thought n/s might start doubling |pg||
nt|Walddk1: Jeffrey Allerton must have moved to Scotland overnight. Las week he lived in Surrey, England, and he is as English as can be|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Paula Leslie, however, is from Scotland originally|pg||
nt|sybarra: or maybe I should say "understand" |pg||
pc|s2|nt|brotherp: not so easy to lead @d's now|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: now west was -2 elsewhere, how can East do?|pg||
nt|bobholl: e has shown 4414 or 4405 so easy :)|pg||
nt|brotherp: and another lead seems to let the contract through|pg||
nt|pelu: @hQ will defeat 4@s|pg||
nt|Walddk1: But has been living in London for about 10 years|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ..and this seems to...|pg||
nt|brotherp: still West passes 3NT knowing the shortness; so club lead looks attractive|pg||
nt|pelu: for me 4@D is not bridge red against green and opp stop in 3@s|pg||
pc|hK|nt|pelu: sorry he made 3@D :(|pg||
nt|psyck: W will be in trouble after @h fin & @d run|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ampelman: after the 3@h bid the @hQ lead is too tough to find|pg||
nt|pauleger: 3NT in the open room. Don´t really know, if E showed 14-16 there or upgraded her hand to a 15-17 NT, however, W directly jumped to game|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no diamond lead so diamond ace will survive|pg||
nt|ady: Penfold pair have played well in this room and will be disappointed to be down|pg||
pc|h6|nt|bobholl: 4@H 2@C 3@S may be |pg||
nt|brotherp: small spade or small club both seem attractive|pg||
nt|oosb: Wow Lesniewski|pg||
nt|oosb: contained the damage|pg||
nt|oosb: with a 3@C bid that went undoubled|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|stc: E has the wrong single @h, give him the J or 10...|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|nt|pelu: what is 3@H?|pg||
nt|oosb: for only -200, vs the 600 that opps had|pg||
nt|oosb: he probably thinks he won 9 imps|pg||
pc|h7|nt|vugraphpl9: nobody alerted|pg||
nt|ampelman: no alert so natural ?|pg||
nt|vugraphpl9: iI think so|pg||
nt|roswolf: semi-bluff|pg||
nt|ampelman: lead-prohibator :)|pg||
nt|granguru:  not a bad idea to establish a @S |pg||
nt|jcwla: Bidders who thread the needle and stop short of game on hands where it is truly impossible to tell how many tricks will make nevertheless make bids like this where it's just down 2 ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: from now until doomsday.|pg||
nt|xenya: the 9 would also do|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|dburn: why is it "not bridge" to try for plus 130 instead of minus 140?|pg||
nt|hedyg: hoping just for the 9@H..|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|stc: W seeking the 9|pg||
nt|hedyg: i have another red 9, can i try that?|pg||
pc|d8|nt|jcwla: Would be a lovely idea to establish a @S - maybe on board 20.|pg||
pc|dK|nt|oosb: wd!|pg||
nt|sybarra: wow, great guess |pg||
nt|oosb: by both defence and declarer|pg||
nt|oosb: super|pg||
nt|vugraphpl9: scores from all tables http://b.poznan2011.pl/mxt/r16runda1.html|pg||
pc|d2|nt|bobholl: small @D ?|pg||
nt|brotherp: think so; in the bidding and play East's 4441 is known so...|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well south knows his partner has 4 diamonds...|pg||
nt|brotherp: still a lot off guessing to be done by van Prooijen|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: perhaps the diamond 9...|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|petergill: The defence to 3NT at other table is not a good advertisement for leading low from xxx in partner's suit to 3NT|pg||
nt|mcarroll: now down to 10 tricks|pg||
nt|peachy: This could maybe make too, keep W in the lead when giving up tricks :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes indeed -a lit dd though|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c6|nt|bobholl: k@D @C looks best|pg||
pc|c8|nt|jtr: they have board 8 which may be a gain|pg||
nt|psyck: not the count is rectified too|pg||
nt|psyck: *now|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|petepunt: or to try for -420 v -170 :)|pg||
nt|peachy: yes, that's why I put in the smiley, I guess I should have been more clear about it|pg||

nt|psyck: nmay just make 1 o/t though in just 3n|pg||
pc|h8|pc|d3|pg||
nt|pelu: West find partner with the best possible cards - and still down 1 - could easy cost 500 to bid 4@D|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s6|nt|sybarra: N is scary!|pg||
pc|s8|nt|vugraphpl9: squeeze|pg||

nt|hedyg: the lady is multiple European and World Champion. didnt get there by ooops|pg||
nt|henryb:  Indeed it is|pg||
nt|petergill: I think I bid 4@S|pg||
nt|ady: any chance of 4@H n/s gone with 4-1 trump split|pg||
mb|2H|nt|bobholl: jan (jansma) asks why east thougth so long :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: south should raise the ante|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Too much for 3@S|pg||
nt|kerasidis: hopefully with minimum values could reach 3nt|pg||
nt|psyck: N decides he has a @h stopper|pg||
nt|andreasw:  4@d now by s?|pg||
nt|psyck: yes, looks like S wants to make a move to slam|pg||
nt|kerasidis: why should ....taking positive answer|pg||
nt|roswolf: writing has been on the wall for a long time - the td ruling slayed them|pg||
nt|peachy: Only four more boards to go, lead too large to make up for Last Arrival team|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Running scores at  http://b.poznan2011.pl/mxt/rrrunda2.html|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@C cue?|pg||
nt|pauleger: interesting 3@c bid|pg||
nt|pauleger: propably a good @d raise|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3nt seems fairly cold for e/w|pg||
nt|roswolf: is 1086 a stop!?|pg||
nt|vugraphpl9: I am not sure but Kopecky said 2s is transfer to nt :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  natural seems to be even a better treatment...less info given to opps|pg||
nt|kaapo: Yes, Multon hits declarers @D suit once again|pg||
nt|sybarra: and tx Oosman,  great to have you join us |pg||
nt|psyck: N will likely bid 5@c now as pass/correct|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes... and S might go for it anyway|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|roswolf: north gets that sinking feeling|pg||
nt|stc: that's why i said, hard to believe...|pg||
nt|hedyg: http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=8697|pg||
nt|hedyg: she had an easy entry to hand with AK@D|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Partner doubled at the 3-level vulnerable|pg||
nt|ybob: 4@C and later 4@S ?|pg||
nt|sybarra: enjoyed being with you |pg||
nt|oosb: Thank you to the team in Poznan for bring us this vugraph and  to BBO, Roland and the entire team|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: West found partner with what West could expect - a bog-standard weak no trump with two low spades|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's not a great 11 count with KQ doubleton|pg||
nt|jcwla: That's not what a little birdie told me.|pg||
nt|oosb: Likewise shirley :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: and to the specs,  great funa and comments!|pg||
mb|3D|nt|petepunt: its a shocking 11 count :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  1N opener had interesting effect of preventing N from showing the @h suit...compare to the auction in OR|pg||
nt|ybob: pd can have 4432|pg||
nt|fabsayc: likely spot|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: ok spade cue|pg||
nt|ampelman: 3@d is minimum, I guess|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@C or 4@D?|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Yes, 4@C is not ideal but nothing is|pg||
nt|henryb:  shouldn't that show @s and @d? or a hand too strong for a direct 4@s?|pg||
nt|sybarra: and at the moment N is hopeful |pg||
nt|petergill: 4@C followed by 4@S suggests 4 spades and a @d suit in my opinion|pg||
nt|petergill: -300 or -200 beats -400|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Maybe a strong 4@S only. Depends on agreement as is the case with everything in this game|pg||
mb|4H|nt|stc: still wining the match and having a good position for the KO rounds|pg||
nt|kerasidis: nice swing|pg||
nt|psyck: N knew the minor, so bids it himself|pg||
nt|psyck: not sure that is a good idea, maybe he wanted to put opener on lead though|pg||
nt|andreasw:  unless @c lead should be a quick claim|pg||
nt|psyck: S tried to be too scientific other table, should just have bid game after x & cue|pg||
mb|p|nt|pauleger: if W has AJ here, you should not put in the @s K here|pg||
nt|pelu: still hard fight for the first 3 places in this group: 62-61-60-60-57-54 VP's|pg||
mb|p|nt|pauleger: a hand, where it is good to lead 2nd from 4 small|pg||
nt|jcwla: Wow.|pg||
nt|vugraphpl9: oh...|pg||
nt|oosb: Boring contract compared to the treat we've had|pg||
nt|oosb: not straight forward though|pg||
nt|fabsayc: although 3nt looks as good|pg||
mb|p|nt|brotherp: finally an easy hand|pg||
nt|oosb: nice lead by Natalia!|pg||
nt|mcarroll: both look -1 to me|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i can make 3nt from this seat|pg||
nt|jtr: So can i|pg||
pc|d8|nt|mcarroll: a bit double dummy though|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|nt|roswolf: blood will flow|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty Kacper for a great job as the vugraph operator|pg||
nt|vugraphpl9: :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty Kari and specs...another round to start in a few mintues|pg||
nt|andyv:  minutes:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  meanwhile S has all sorts of problems here|pg||
nt|kaapo: Maybe Madsen enters dummy in clubs to play towards @SA again|pg||
nt|sybarra: bet we switch to play B |pg||
nt|Walddk1: If I don't have one, I prefer a direct 4@S|pg||
nt|sybarra: as W shows out|pg||
nt|henryb:  I would probably have duplicated the action at the other table: 3N|pg||
nt|Walddk1: In order to avoid confusion|pg||
nt|petergill: 3.5@S seems ideal, now that I think about it. |pg||
nt|ybob: agree 3.5 @S|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Want to borrow  ½  ?|pg||
nt|Walddk1: 3½@S|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok I am prejudice,  but at this table the ladies have been the stars |pg||
nt|sybarra: and compliments to the guys for staying in their seats |pg||
nt|oosb: will let that slip this time, on behalf of all the guys|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|roswolf: NOW 4NT|pg||
nt|pauleger: with stiff @dQ it looked obvious to swith to @h|pg||
pc|c3|nt|bobholl: they play polish @C so N knows S is strong |pg||
nt|bobholl: jan is thinking long not normal for him|pg||
nt|oosb: :)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|roswolf: 6@D by default|pg||
nt|roswolf: everyone is pointing out that by ducking a spade 3nt is defeated - in practicethat means a small spade lead from north which might well not be found|pg||
nt|ady: yes   great diamond lay out   dont even need club finesse which is right|pg||
pc|cA|nt|bobholl: not that easy he still has got a lot of losing @D|pg||
nt|brotherp: not knowing the friendly distribution though Schollaard will spend some time figuring out the savest way|pg||
nt|petergill: A problem with 3NT: If West was not vul, 3NT looks good, but a vul 3@C preempter is too likely to have an entry, and then -400 or -500 will be an ugly score, a lot of the time. ...|pg||
nt|petergill: Though @C10 might make 3NT good. |pg||
nt|oosb: because they were excellent indeed|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree,  they were great "catchers" |pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|roswolf: well done|pg||
nt|ampelman: 4@h was the bid east wanted to here|pg||
nt|ampelman: hear|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h5|nt|roswolf: especially if west bid it -|pg||
nt|kaapo: But East can win @SA, play heart to king and then 3rd heart after ace|pg||
pc|h3|nt|dburn: so far, so bad|pg||
nt|sybarra: and that is important also |pg||
nt|vugraphpl9: next round starts in 30 minutes|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|roswolf: easy claim|pg||
nt|hedyg: last board of this match, we will be back in 1 hour and 45 minutes for more fun|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h9|nt|roswolf: this looks only -1|pg||
nt|jcwla: Kopecky may be going to the desk.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Well, anyway, this completes the rout.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Thanks Roland and John, and all.  For now, so long.|pg||
nt|vugraphpl9: last board, thx and see you tomorrow|pg||
nt|ady: thx all|pg||
nt|jtr: Better take the @ss now|pg||
nt|vugraphpl9: running scores http://b.poznan2011.pl/mxt/swleaderb.html|pg||
nt|jtr: although ruffing @cs wont work|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|brotherp: setting up clubs sure is|pg||
nt|andyv:  finally went for the 3-3 @ss|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|petergill: Steph Jacob is playing this well, trying to remove East's exit cards|pg||
nt|petergill: I think all four Aucklanders have played rep bridge for NZ. |pg||
nt|petergill: I think Stephanie might even escape for minus 100, an excellent outcome really|pg||
nt|ybob: two rounds @S and wait ...|pg||
nt|jtr: needs to run this|pg||
nt|ady: hand 8   5@D  made with an overtrick in OR |pg||
nt|jtr: otherwise east can ruff in and cash @ss|pg||
pc|hA|nt|xenya: thanks everyone|pg||
pc|s4|nt|roswolf: cashing a top honour is more attractive|pg||
