mb|p|mb|1N!|an|12-14|mb|2H!|nt|brolucius: E/W's 1NT opening covers some unusual shapes (such as 5-4-2-2) because of their opening bid structure. Here East happens to be 4-3-3-3.|pg||

mb|d|nt|brolucius: 5@C does not look attractive because it has gone past 4@S, which could easily be a better contract.|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Maybe he could but decided against|pg||

nt|Walddk2: http://eurobridge.org/competitions/09Paris/Paris.htm  for the tournament website|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, but doubling 3@S just because you hold x-x-x in the suit is not necessarily a good idea.|pg||
