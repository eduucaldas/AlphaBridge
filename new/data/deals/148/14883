nt|ritong: basically, french style is 15/17 NT  here pilon "tacticalled" a bit|pg||
pc|cT|nt|peachy: Jo Anne:)|pg||
nt|ritong: due to positioàn, vulnerability and a not-so-bad hand|pg||
nt|peachy: I think upgrade w West hand is a popular thing|pg||

nt|ritong: bompis has a tough decision|pg||
nt|peachy: worth the same as AJxx|pg||
nt|ritong: all he knows is his pard had not enough to call 3@s|pg||
nt|casenjo:  I like those 10's and 9's, they certainly help NT hands|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c5|pg||
nt|casenjo:  Pretty big boost with Sontag's distribution|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|peachy: diamond lead is likely, to set it|pg||
pc|dA|nt|peachy: o should have said "obvious" not likely|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d6|pg||
pc|s5|nt|casenjo:  Sometimes it is better to have a method where the 'big hand' is not on  lead, and the other hand needs to guess what to lead.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ritong: not certain they made a reasonable decision, since 5@c is likely one off versus one off in 4@h, but if this goes down as it should, at least at first glance, result will be OK|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s9|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sK|nt|casenjo:  Other times, you like to begin by endplaying the big hand at trick 1, when he has to 'lead away' from honors|pg||
nt|peachy: this is a nice hand in evidence for those who oppose transfer overcalls|pg||

nt|tempid: Certainly shortened the play of the hand by taking the @d finesse early.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|casenjo:  Possibly, it went down 2 in the Cayne room|pg||
nt|ritong: sontag had an alternate choice with 2@d|pg||
