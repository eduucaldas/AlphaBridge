nt|roswolf: a bit unnecessary to go -3 though|pg||
nt|ady: bad start for England    |pg||
nt|paulg:  there was an aggressive takeout double by East in the other room, otherwise it is hard to see how EW get into the auction|pg||
nt|henryb:  That was in 1970 $ which were worth about five of todays in purchasing power|pg||
nt|jtr: If it was a bluff (rather than a misunderstanding) then well done South|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: Good afternoon everyone and welcome back to Hamar in Norway for the annual Olrud Easter Festival.|pg||
nt|athene: well NS can make ten tricks in hearts here but i don't see many pairs bidding 4@H|pg||
mb|1S|nt|chick: http://www.bridgesenteret.no/|pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s managed to jam the bidding somewhat|pg||
nt|ady: 3@S   unlcuky to go down in OR|pg||
nt|roswolf: in the other room|pg||
nt|athene: south will surely not want to bid 4@H - she will imagine that is just going to push EW into a making 4@S|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@H should make, with the double making @CA easy to locate |pg||
nt|ady: might even stretch to 4 here|pg||
nt|athene: she might consider some sort of fit bid in clubs perhaps|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|athene: west is just going to bid 4@S anyway, whatever south does, surely?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: Steam age Acol bidding next door  But well stopped anyway|pg||
mb|2C|nt|chick: Swiss Teams, 12 rounds of 8-board matches. This is a match from round 12.|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  harder to avoid losing this AK if you bid a slam|pg||
mb|2H|nt|chick: Our operator today is Andre Hagen, hi Andre :)|pg||
nt|chick: Your commentators are Baard Olav Aasan and Carl Mathiesen, Norway, Ralf Willquist, Sweden, and I am Cornelia Yoder, USA.|pg||
nt|baardolav: Hello all|pg||
nt|chick: Hamar is on the shores of Lake Mjosa, the largest lake in Norway.|pg||
nt|petepunt: tendency to dbl on east hand these days whereas originaly players would pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: the axe might fall|pg||
nt|ady: yes 4@H can make   |pg||
nt|roswolf: no just a couple of imps probably|pg||

nt|ralfwil: Hello Marshall|pg||
nt|chick: Welcome Marshall|pg||
nt|petergill: A @d lead might beat even 2@S, as the cards lie|pg||
nt|jtr: East may make a move now|pg||
nt|jtr: Depending on the inference of 4@s|pg||
nt|jtr: For me it shows something like AKx, xx, xxx, KQxxx|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  this looks a more standard auction|pg||
nt|lark20: Should make for a small swing to Scotland|pg||
nt|petepunt: N,  likely to misguess @C after the x|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|ady: North can hardly be confident of 2 trump tricks and south has no double of 4@S opposite a weak 2|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|ralfwil: -1 after a @d lead|pg||
nt|petepunt: S had tough 2nd bid|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|nt|henryb:  In my world partner would have a hand like AKxx xx xx KQJxx|pg||
nt|jtr: They should stop anyway But a @h lead beats it|pg||
nt|jtr: Pedant:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|baardolav: A good start for Smith's|pg||
nt|petepunt: 2N might have put her partner of 5@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|lark20: Hearts can be discarded on Diamonds|pg||
nt|henryb:  Good spades, good clubs, no red controls|pg||
pc|d2|nt|marlowepi: 2S clearly not GF as otherwise N would probably bid just 2N|pg||
nt|jtr: Not unreasonable to lead a @h if you think|pg||
pc|dT|nt|petergill: At the other table, Sandra Penfold didn't open a weak 2@H, perhaps influenced by the theory: "never open a weak two when you have a limit raise or better in the other major"|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|rmb1: Difficult for NS to double, neither North or South can rely on partner for any defence|pg||
nt|mikeirl: H discardwouldbebetter|pg||
nt|vugraphzgz: ok...|pg||
nt|bg: oops now N has a chance if she guess the clubs|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mikeirl: better|pg||
pc|sA|nt|jtr: They are likely to be off 2 keycards and nothing else|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s4|pg||
pc|c7|nt|petepunt: after 3 rounfs of @D N may be abke to work this one out ?|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cJ|nt|petepunt: East has 3433 or 4432 shape is the Q|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|athene: i think it's good to have lots of spades when you open a weak-2@H - it means you can beat opps when they get into spades (as they are wont to do after you open 2@H) :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|woozle: tight spade game for EW, perhaps...or a small heart partscore for NS|pg||
mb|1H|mb|2D|nt|jferg: or 5dias for e/w|pg||
nt|jferg: going 2 off|pg||
nt|woozle: West has an awkward hand over 1H...an expert panel would probably have plurality pass, a significant minority for 2D, and maybe rogue votes for 1S and double|pg||
mb|2N!|an|good 4 card raise|nt|Walddk3: http://www.ebu.co.uk/results/2010January-July/LadyMilne/results.htm  for results and standings after round 3|pg||
nt|woozle: 2NT from Jagger, which I presume is a heart raise of some kind|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|jferg: 3s on the way to 4d.s|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|woozle: Brown raises only to 3D..perhaps she's seen her partner's overcalls before...but it looks like a feeble effort to not remove any level of heart bids from the opponents|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|h2|nt|woozle: NS buy the hand in 3H, which should go down one as long as West keeps their mitts off the ace of diamonds|pg||
nt|toobad: a v wet pass there from Rosario|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h9|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h6|nt|woozle: I disagree...West had already overbid her offensive potential with 2D...but East appears to me to be on valium|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|woozle: Nice descriptive pitch from Brown though, which should avoid accidents like an untimely diamond shift|pg||
nt|toobad: E has made a free 3d bid . i wd push with 3S|pg||
pc|c3|nt|jferg: disagree on the discard opening up sapdes gives a trick|pg||

nt|athene: 3NT looks very reachable here for NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: perhaps not so easily makeable|pg||
mb|1H|nt|petergill: So far, three games needing finesses to work so far, but the finesses have been failing. |pg||
nt|jtr: 4@s here but not easy to reach|pg||
mb|p|nt|petepunt: many would come in with S,  but pass is good|pg||
nt|jtr: Brown may double|pg||
nt|jtr: More as a way of finding a sacrifice if they bid 41hs|pg||
nt|jtr: 4@hs|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|rmb1: 3NT looks reasonable when both black kings are over the aces, but difficult to bid or play|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed n/s missed the boat in the other room - in their sequence i wonder whether 3@D was intended to be forcing?|pg||
nt|paulg:  i guess it's a matter of style, but I'd probably respond 1NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: perhaps questionable whether S should remove to 4S given total lack of help in red suits & great concentration in blacks....bid N had exploratory options at the three level that he ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: shunned, so to S it may have sounded like he was being warned off|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|roswolf: was east's pass alerted!?|pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s may well play walsh|pg||
nt|jtr: Ah she is going to show a raise to 3@h|pg||
mb|3H|nt|petergill: At the other table, Moore followed the modern practice of opening on almost anything when in 3rd seat with fav vulnerability|pg||
nt|roswolf: 15-17 rebid by north|pg||
nt|athene: interesting that east didn't bid 2@C over 1nt in the other room - perhaps they play that as majors or something|pg||
nt|paulg:  and I'd probably try to play 1NT this time|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 3NT looks worth a punt, vul at imps|pg||
nt|petergill: but Susan Stockdale might prefer to explore|pg||
nt|athene: if south follows an invitational sequence to 3@D north might bash 3nt in on the strength of the diamond fit|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: e.g. 2@C - 2@D - 3@D|pg||
nt|athene: playing 2-way checkback|pg||
nt|roswolf: fair comment|pg||
nt|henryb:  If so, why not just bid it?|pg||
nt|jtr: 9 losers doesnt warrant it|pg||
nt|jtr: Because an immediate 3@h is weak|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|c3|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is invitational i think|pg||
nt|athene: for any specs unfamiliar with this method, south's 2@C forces 2@D, after which all her bids are natural and invitational|pg||
nt|athene: south's 2@D over 1nt would be artificial game force|pg||
nt|petergill: For profiles of the players, click on the player's name at http://www.ebu.co.uk/|pg||
nt|roswolf: and 3nt looks eminently reasonable for north|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT  likely to make|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed it is the practical shot|pg||
pc|h5|nt|marlowepi: N does not have enough side strength to start with a trump, but queen of spades is probably a better shot than small|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hQ|nt|petergill: The likely club lead to the ace, then 9@C back, leaves declarer awkwardly placed|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think Stockdale might have doubled 2@c|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|roswolf: this will be the first major swing to someone|pg||
pc|hA|nt|athene: on a club lead, if north works out what is going on, her only chance is to play west for the @SA, as otherwise east has an entry for her good clubs|pg||
nt|petergill: On the @d's, East is likely to discard a spade, a heart and either: two clubs or "one club and the last spade" - very interesting hand|pg||
nt|ady: not quite true    could also play east for A@S and rise with KC on club return|pg||
nt|athene: but north also has the option of winning the @CK on the second round of the suit and trying to keep west off lead|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h6|pc|s5|pg||
nt|ady: no sorry  could not make in such a case|pg||
pc|h3|nt|petergill: So playing 3NT at the other table, where the bidding had made West likely to have @SA, would be easier than playing 3NT at this table, with no revealing EW bidding|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|nt|henryb:  In fact should have|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|d5|nt|athene: if the clubs get set up, north can't e.g. try @HA, heart to the @H10, as even if that forced the @HK, west could still put east in with the @SA|pg||
nt|petergill: A spade can be spared from dummy|pg||
nt|athene: so basically north has to play west for the @SA anyway|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ady: looks like must make now|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
nt|roswolf: ?|pg||
nt|petergill: Not true - there is also the possibility that East gets squeezed if East has @SA, @HJ and the clubs|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d6|pc|d8|pc|d7|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|pc|sT|nt|jtr: accident possibilities|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|cT|pc|d2|nt|petepunt: easier if S had bid as @C to ace more marked|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|pg||
nt|jtr: oh dear|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|pc|s8|pc|s7|pg||
nt|ady: would put money on this making|pg||
pc|s6|pc|h7|nt|jtr: I wonder if E/W play Rusinow leads?|pg||
pc|s9|nt|petergill: Me too|pg||
nt|athene: yes but playing east for @SA and @HJ is surely less tempting that just playing west for @SA?|pg||
nt|athene: *than just|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|petergill: West is discarding like a person with @SA|pg||

nt|vugraphzgz: it's a bit small |pg||
mb|1H|nt|jtr: anyone care to check?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|athene: if east counts declarer's hcp, she knows she has @SAK (in which case she has nine tricks) or @HA anyway|pg||
nt|rmb1: Difficult for EW to paint a false picture for declarer|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|baardolav: The leaders, Levbird,  need 16 VP to secure the victory of this tournament|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: True|pg||
nt|paulg:  i find it hard to believe that North made 4@s on this hand|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I am sorry to say that this has been mis-scored in the open room|pg||
nt|jtr: Apparently not which makes South's play strange|pg||
nt|jtr: 4@s seems lay down|pg||
mb|3S|nt|Walddk4: 620 EW it should have been but nothing happens when I message the operator|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: need careful defense to 3N|pg||
nt|athene: it was hard for NS to get into the auction in the other room, but North solves their problem here|pg||
nt|paulg:  ok, thanks Roland|pg||
nt|lark20: That is more like it. Thanks|pg||
mb|4S|nt|marlowepi: would have, anyway|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3C NF?|pg||
nt|petergill: Fiona Brown's 1@H overcall on four cards is infinitely superior to a takeout double with only two spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 4 card suit overcall by Fiona has got n/s into the bidding|pg||
nt|athene: i guess this might be an imp for 140 vs 100|pg||
nt|paulg:  Another style question is whether to raise 1@s or bid 2@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  it should not make a lot of difference here, as East will normally raise clubs and you might then support spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzgz: surely good enough to raise spades later|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: maybe declarer has too much work to do to get the overtrick|pg||
nt|henryb:  really?|pg||
nt|jtr: ah declarer didnt play the @hQ at trick one|pg||
pc|h6|nt|athene: although she has a pretty good idea of the trump layout|pg||
nt|jtr: oh maybe you cant do it anyway|pg||
nt|jtr: Not easily anyway|pg||
nt|henryb:  well, you can: @hQKA, @c to J and A, @h ruff, @dA, @cK, spades|pg||
nt|jtr: or just @ss then @c|pg||
nt|jtr: Declarer wont know the lead is a singleton|pg||
nt|henryb:  The suggested line above is better as it does not need the muracle spade position|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ralfwil: For me it looks like 4@h is the best contrace  - while I can see all cards|pg||
nt|athene: from the 1nt bid|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|paulg:  yes, I think it is East's pass that is a little pessimistic |pg||
nt|jtr: Playing for @hs 5-2 and ruffing a @d seems reasonable|pg||
pc|c7|nt|baardolav: 3@c is non forcing... 5@c is not a bad contract, need the @c 3-3, like 3nt...|pg||
nt|chick: was a nice bid by S, considering his void in @Cs, but unfortunately the trump split sinks this contract|pg||
nt|petergill: Fiona lives with Hugh McGann from Ireland - Hugh would not be impressed if she didn't bid 1@H at the highly suitable vulnerability|pg||
nt|ady: best to play clubs now|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cJ|nt|jtr: Wow great play|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|ady: establish toe 2 club tricks before ruffing any further diamonds which would allow east to discard clubs|pg||
nt|athene: yes, when the third round of clubs stands up declarer has 140|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|nt|lark20: The pass prevented west being able to raise spades "later"|pg||
pc|d9|nt|jtr: No, that wont work actually|pg||
nt|jtr: You cant finesse the @hs and the @s|pg||
nt|henryb:  what won't work?|pg||

nt|jtr: Spec points out a low @s was better play|pg||

pc|s2|nt|athene: ruff this high to prepare a finesse of the @H9 maybe|pg||

mb|d|mb|1H|nt|woozle: I like the sentiment of 1NT, but this is a very good 18|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|1N|nt|jferg: agree worth upgrading with the good 5 card suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: Seale continues with 1NT...we'll never know if she always intended to bid this or if the 1H bid put her off|pg||

nt|jtr: Low @s would have catered for that possibility|pg||
nt|henryb:  yes David|pg||
nt|jtr: Lots of value from that hand|pg||
nt|jtr: That is the first time you have agreed with me in 30 years:)|pg||
nt|henryb:  no; the second I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: did well to bid and make 4@H in OR|pg||
nt|athene: well done to bid game on 23 hcp and no long suits - but it should be flat|pg||

mb|p|nt|paulg:  I was watching vugraph a couple of weeks ago when Michael Rosenberg was commentating|pg||
mb|1N|nt|baardolav: It feel like a bad start for Livebird... going down in two games now|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes|pg||
nt|paulg:  he said he never passed out an opening bid in fourth|pg||
nt|paulg:  independent of how many spades he had|pg||
nt|henryb:  am still on first cup of coffee|pg||
mb|d|nt|jtr: There had to be a reason|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: playing ACOL, i think the idea is, if you open 1minor and give a single raise to partner's major, that is always a good hand, as you promise a strong notrump or an unbalanced hand|pg||
nt|paulg:  Many use the Pearson Rule .. points + number of spades should be at least 15|pg||
nt|paulg:  this hand meets any criteria for opening|pg||
nt|jtr: this will make if they stick it|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 23 + 3 for the singleton + 1 for the doubleton = 27, once the fit is found|pg||
nt|athene: so partner is encouraged to move quite aggressively here|pg||
nt|rmb1: I don't think the heart pips were good enough to allow North to ruff high.|pg||
nt|athene: it's very different from a strong notrump structure where west typically has balanced rubbish for this|pg||
nt|roswolf: east may try a trial bid|pg||
nt|athene: on the previous hand? north could ruff with the @H10?|pg||
nt|petergill: The 4-1 trump break might make the play of 4@h tricky|pg||
mb|r|nt|marlowepi: maybe, but it is routine to get to game on both hands, and all games fail|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: So will this|pg||
mb|2C|nt|roswolf: but i prefer the game raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|baardolav: -9 on 2@c two down...|pg||
nt|henryb:  I only see 6 tricks for declarer, and seven for the defense|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|petergill: South led a club at the other table|pg||
nt|petergill: This lead is much more promising for the defence|pg||
nt|henryb:  4@h, 2@d and a @c|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jtr: Isnt South in trouble on the 4th @c?|pg||
nt|henryb:  Maybe S can be strip squeezed|pg||

nt|chick: Results and standings at http://nbfdata.bridge.no/Turnering/default.asp?Fil=olrud2010swiss|pg||
nt|athene: yes, declarer would surely like to lead diamonds towards dummy and get a spade discard|pg||
nt|jtr: I guess they can unblock the @ds|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think East is in trouble before that|pg||
pc|c8|nt|marlowepi: yes, a very likely play in the club suit since W did all the bidding|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|pg||
nt|vugraphzgz: 3@D is SP apparently|pg||
nt|jtr: Yes if South holds up the @c|pg||
pc|d9|nt|petergill: I think declarer needed to duck that spade|pg||
nt|petergill: and she might be in trouble now|pg||
pc|dK|nt|marlowepi: he is planning to take club finesse|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|pg||
nt|baardolav: Dont think so... Ovesen have already shown the @s Q|pg||
nt|chick: might as well, even if he knows it will likely fail|pg||

nt|paulg:  but perhaps not as SP as the @d2? :)|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c9|pc|c2|pg||
nt|petergill: In very big trouble now|pg||
pc|cT|nt|athene: and @HJ as over-ruff for very easy one down|pg||
nt|athene: i think declarer was a little too hasty to win that first trick|pg||
nt|ady: should go down now|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|athene: surely spades 4-2 was far more likely than 5-1 - especially in view of no 1@S overcall from north|pg||
nt|ady: yes  taking first spade not good|pg||
nt|athene: (who as we have seen isn't overly scared of bidding things)|pg||
nt|petergill: Susan will play another spade, but Susan likes to think things though before she does the play she intends to do - a good habit, in my opinion|pg||
pc|c6|nt|marlowepi: it is clear to play ace of clubs on the bidding, the question is why not do it before the heart|pg||
pc|h2|pc|c7|pg||
pc|s2|nt|marlowepi: when he led a heart toward dummy instead of starting on his die suit, which would be normal technique, it looked like he was planning to finesse clubs|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sK|nt|ady: England going further ahead|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|marlowepi: probably he was trying to slip a heart past first in case diamonds were 4-1|pg||
nt|vugraphzgz: 9@C is throw losers|pg||
pc|hA|nt|petergill: @SQ = reverse suit pref to deny @CK/@CA, to say she prefer @D to @C |pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|pc|h7|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pc|h8|pc|s5|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he probably has to lose the lead twice, so if he can sneak the heart by he gains a tempo|pg||
nt|marlowepi: "die suit" = side suit:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: the defence took full advantage of declarer's carelessness|pg||
nt|petepunt: n/s play 4 card majors so 1N is understandable response|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|nt|jferg: 1nt or 2h for e/w|pg||
nt|woozle: England gained six imps on board three, when Stockdale and Brown defeated 3H in the replay|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|woozle: West apparently doesn't raise hearts with this hand type, and the three card support remaind a secret until dummy appears|pg||

nt|petergill: Some people don't like to lead doubletons|pg||
nt|athene: game-tries which tell the defence anything at all about declarer's hand are a losing proposition in my opinion|pg||
nt|petergill: Me - I don't know why that is so|pg||
nt|roswolf: in the other room e/w took liberties and were punished|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|petergill: East missed that South pitched her last @D on a spade|pg||

nt|mikeirl: a splinter would be reasonable here|pg||
nt|paulg:  that's very independent of you Beryl|pg||
nt|petepunt: 3N needs unlikely 10@H lead to trouble it|pg||
nt|jtr: 3@hs looks useful|pg||
mb|3D|nt|marlowepi: unlucky for 4H to fail, though the double is a warning about the spades. 5C a phantom that E is likely to bid|pg||
nt|lark20: Sorry Paul|pg||
nt|paulg:  West has an awkward hand to bid, and it may get murky now with 4th suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  one option is to start with a strong 2@h response, although the diamond support is poor for this|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: EBU should get on the scoreboard now|pg||

nt|ady: EBu recover a few imps here|pg||
pc|d7|nt|petergill: I would have bid these cards as they were bid at the other table, showing my strength via 1NT as West. Chros Duckworh's 2@D bid will do better than my choice of 1NT|pg||

nt|marlowepi: if E had the 4th diamond i think S could succeed|pg||

nt|marlowepi: anyway that is probably what he will play for|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i am not sure when it would be that W would play the spade queen|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h7|pc|hT|nt|petergill: I suppose Axx in an opponent's bid suit can be dodgy, rarely being more than one stopper, so Chris's 2@D bid might have more merit than my 1NT choice. |pg||

nt|jtr: Maybe 6@s is slightly better but impossible to bid|pg||
mb|1S|nt|rmb1: Heart suit is worth degrading|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: with hearts 4-4 n/s can make 3NT    only normal chance of game|pg||

nt|henryb:  somehow 6@s by East looks a lot better than 6@h by W|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|nt|athene: but if you play some cute bid to show 18-19, you probably try to treat as many hands as possible as 18-19 balanced|pg||

nt|roswolf: should be a flat board nevertheless|pg||
nt|jtr: Were you geting more coffee?|pg||

nt|jtr: @c lead and @hs are 4-1 might beat it|pg||
nt|henryb:  In 6@s declarer wins the opening lead, draws trumps and ducks a heart|pg||
mb|5C|nt|baardolav: Seems like The Livebirds have their worst result in this last match... |pg||

mb|5D|nt|bg: can beat this 2 tricks with a club start|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: 2@S forces 2nt and denies 4 spades (the idea being to avoid responder ever playing it)|pg||
nt|jtr: KQJxx@hs and a few things would make that ok|pg||
mb|6C|nt|ady: can make 5@D  by playing Q@C  but an unlikely lay|pg||
nt|petergill: South = 19.4 HCP according to the useful tool http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=AQ8+J95+AKJ74+A3|pg||
nt|petergill: i.e. the Kaplans - Rubens Evaluator|pg||
nt|athene: this method of having a 2@C/2@D bid to show 18-19 balanced or thereabouts is quite popular amongst the top italian pairs - i think they do it to take some load off their 1@C opener|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: 6NT is a good 2nd to 6@s|pg||
nt|jtr: West thinks @ss are the keycard suit it seems|pg||
nt|henryb:  yes, and with the @d double, she will surely prefer @s or NT to @h|pg||
nt|jtr: NT i think|pg||
nt|jtr: Which might also make if @hs are 4-1|pg||
mb|6S|nt|marlowepi: that last swing was probably caused by the 2D bid, which allowed E to bid in leisurely fashion. a more space-consuming jump would have put a lot of pressure on E|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i.e. the idea is it isn't especially good when you open 2@D but it is better when you open 1@C and it can't be strong balanced|pg||
nt|lark20: I think their 1NT rebid is 15-17|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: and it allows the jump 2NT rebid by opener to be artificial, and if playing a weak 1NT (as NS do) it takes pressure off the 15-19 NT rebids  |pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  yes, the spade shortage is a minus, but most other things are positive|pg||
nt|bg: why would S duck?|pg||

nt|chick: Thanks to our excellent operator Andre Hagen, and to the event organizers Finn|pg||
nt|petergill: At the other table, Nevena Senior (South) doesn't like to stay out of game - the rather nice dummy wasn't enough|pg||
nt|athene: south's 4@S in the other room was a bit of a 2-way shot i suppose - with so many spades, you don't want to agonize over 4@H/4@S decisions, so just solve matters right away|pg||
nt|jtr: Defence can take a few here|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|chick: Brandsnes and Kaare Kristiansen, for bringing this fine event to BBO!|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Bye!|pg||
nt|ady: e/w have an easy 3@H contract   but are unlikely to be allowed to play there|pg||

nt|lark20: Very strong|pg||
pc|s3|nt|paulg:  many would play that 3@c shows the black suits here|pg||
nt|djneill: identical weak 1NT opening both rooms, South has distribution but likely no convention to show that - double reserved for penalty|pg||
pc|sK|nt|paulg:  having passed up the opportunity to bid 3@c on the first round|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Seems like 3NT is cold unless you find the double dummy lead of @DQ|pg||

pc|s8|nt|athene: west could have done something over 1@S here|pg||
nt|petergill: though Nevena was bidding 4@S partly as an advance sacrifice against a possible 4@H|pg||
nt|roswolf: agreed|pg||
nt|athene: she does have a total maximum for a passed hand, and both unbid suits, and it's love all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It got a heart lead in the other room snd should really have made|pg||
nt|petepunt: some would bid 2N jacoby and 3@C singleton|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|marlowepi: i agree carl. i don;t know where E though he would find 9 tricks in NT on that auction--or even 8|pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: wow, no double of 2@S either|pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks finis -e/w are too passive|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|baardolav: Need a double now...|pg||
nt|petergill: Chris Duckworth, at the sutiable vulnerability, might have doubled 1@S, or 2@s, for take-out|pg||
nt|athene: partscores aren't just for matchpoints - they can be 6-imp swings too|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|rmb1: Helpful lead for declarer, should make 9 tricks now|pg||
pc|sT|nt|petepunt: S will feel she has not done enough|pg||
pc|s7|nt|marlowepi: 2S is 10-13? if a standard weak 2, it is a bad idea with two aces, especially at these colors. if N wants a swing, as he should, 1S would be just fine|pg||
nt|ady: South took a sensible view that and ace and a jack and a poor 6 card suit would be unlikely to produce a game opposite around 16 hcp and possible only 2 spades|pg||
pc|c7|nt|Walddk4: Declarer lost the third club to East who switched to a low diamond|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Declarer played low and had five top losers|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Only chance is @DA onside|pg||
nt|paulg:  on this auction it is clear that the @dA is onside|pg||
nt|paulg:  but I guess Punch opened 1@H|pg||
nt|Walddk4: @DQJ onside is not a valid point, because then the defence has five natural tricks when East switches to @DQ|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Blind spot when declarer followed small|pg||
nt|paulg:  yes, playing the @dA is only line|pg||
nt|jtr: @d was led next door apparently|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|marlowepi: actually i would open 1S in any seat at any colors and any stage of match|pg||
pc|s5|nt|petepunt: a fair slam|pg||
pc|d3|pc|c2|pc|c8|pg||
nt|sharkey: Eide's 2@S opening is a REAL weak 2 - compare with Svendsen's Muliti Vul 9xxxxxx..... a match or two ago|pg||
nt|sharkey: agree Marshall|pg||
nt|marlowepi: for me a "real" weak two does not have 2 aces, nor is it 64 in the majors|pg||
nt|baardolav: I belive Eide Houmøller playes a weak multi and 2@h 2@s is 8-11 or someting like that|pg||
nt|chick: we also saw a previous weak 2 with two aces|pg||
pc|s2|pc|h2|pc|c3|pc|h7|pg||
nt|lark20: If west's multi can be as high as 11 points, she couls have DA instead of CQ and DQ|pg||
nt|jtr: @c10 clearer suit preference|pg||
pc|hK|nt|petergill: At this vulnerability, you only lose 3 imps when both 2@S and your contract are "minus one"  -50 and -50 = 3 imps out |pg||
nt|paulg:  but easier here ... now thinking about club safety plays ... and decided that there was not one|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h8|nt|Walddk4: Not a heart surely|pg||
nt|vugraphzgz: yes a heart|pg||
nt|paulg:  i hope people don't multi with AKxxxx and an ace|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: techniocally then, the and does fit the range, but tactically it is a very dubious idea to open 2S with that sort of hand. |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Did she really pitch a heart?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|sharkey: Also - why open weak 2 with Axxx in @H side suit?|pg||
nt|bg: wonder why N did not show a club control instead of 4 hearts?|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hA|nt|athene: now declarer hasn't time to get the heart away on the long diamond|pg||
nt|athene: assuming a fairly swift heart switch from someone|pg||
nt|ady: as long as North shows some spade support I dont think e/w will buy the contract in 2 or 3@H|pg||
nt|petergill: If spades were 2-2, we commentators might use different words to describe NS's (and even West's) decisions.  |pg||
nt|rmb1: I'm sure declarer was pleased when spades were 3-1|pg||
nt|athene: 4@S might not make even with trumps 2-2 - you need the diamonds to be sort of happy|pg||
nt|petergill: @DA then @D to jack and king would have been slightly better|pg||
nt|athene: you could lose @H, @C, @D, @D|pg||
nt|vugraphzgz: she did - but East really did play a @D|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|paulg:  Macdonald is a very competent declarer ... and needs to be given how aggressively this pair bids games|pg||

mb|d|nt|jtr: Confucius he say, "Both sides play in same suit one mad"|pg||

nt|djneill: East, with a weak 1N opening, doubles 1NT not as support, but "are they kidding I'm the strong one"|pg||
nt|henryb:  This is the last board of the set. Thanks all for watching, and we will see you back at 2:15 English summer time|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: But still 5 or 6 IMPs to Scotland|pg||
mb|2N|nt|petepunt: 1 off possible|pg||
nt|djneill: West responded with 3 HCP, but playing weak NT, there is safety with light responses - opener will have strength or distribution|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: the big bidding issue here is whether south is obliged to cue if it doesn't raise the level of the contract|pg||
nt|rmb1: Next match at 11:50 BST (15 minutes).  Live streaming TV at http://www.ustream.tv/channel/lady-milne-trophy|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@s is easy on a club lead (which should be ducked), harder on a trump lead |pg||
nt|djneill: West reveals the joke?|pg||
nt|jtr: NI have a good potential swing on board 12|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i.e. is north saying "cue a red suit please" or is she saying "cue if you like your hand"|pg||
nt|djneill: ok how does 2N fare here|pg||
nt|jtr: 3@c makes more sense with West's hand|pg||
pc|d4|nt|rmb1: EBU still have a good result on board 12 to score up|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes north just wants to make a mild slam suggestion and other times she only needs to know about a particular control|pg||
nt|petergill: that's Chris Duckworth in the left of the live streaming, for the 20 or 30 viewers|pg||
nt|athene: this sort of problem is why people play "serious 3nt" and things like that|pg||
nt|petepunt: sry always there|pg||
nt|djneill: North is thrown in a few times, one of the downsides of having a strong hand|pg||
nt|jtr: A @d lead givesd an entry to pick up the @cs|pg||
nt|jtr: But North has to give away at least one trick on the opening lead|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d8|nt|petergill: and her screenmate on her right is Susan Stockdale|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|petergill: Good lead. |pg||
nt|roswolf: both England pairs have played well and deserve their healthly lead|pg||
nt|petergill: And unlike the other table, where East bid hearts, declarer has no clues about the @h layout|pg||
nt|petergill: This could be a good board for the EBU|pg||
nt|petergill: The club cue bid on her left put Nicole Cook off the club lead - she has done well to lead trumps|pg||
nt|athene: i don't see any way declarer can play completely safely for ten tricks on this lead|pg||
nt|athene: for example you might try winning in hand and taking the heart finesse with the idea that even if it loses you can throw two clubs on the hearts|pg||
nt|athene: but this risks ruffs in both red suits so it's hardly 100%|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes this may be a fight but declarer should prevail|pg||
nt|ady: could try a heart finesse while there is K@S entry  but risks a diamond switch and ruff|pg||
nt|petergill: In some variations of the play: at some stage, East needs to put a heart through before the @d's are set up|pg||
nt|athene: similarly you can't just draw all the trumps and attack diamonds because the defence will play a club|pg||
nt|athene: and you are a tempo behind, and may lose @D @D @C @C|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Thanks to our operator and Beryl and Paul|pg||

nt|petergill: When East wins @HK, what will East switch to? It's not clear at all, looking at 26 cards. |pg||
nt|ady: spade switch from East would certainly beat the contract|pg||
nt|petergill: A spade is clearer looking at 52 cards than when looking at 26 cards. What if North has A9x in spades?|pg||
nt|ady: even without the spade switch still likely to go down|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: shit|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: yes a spade might be costly but you know north probably hasn't got four so partner has at least four|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: of course east may take a bath - but this is an international match|pg||
nt|ady: only switch to give it is a diamond|pg||
nt|petergill: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bath_coup for those who don't understand the bath references|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w play reverse carding?|pg||

nt|henryb:  there is a strong case for playing that though|pg||
nt|Walddk5: http://www.ebu.co.uk/results/2010January-July/LadyMilne/results.htm  for results and standings after round 3|pg||
nt|jtr: They used to play my system but dont play regularly enough nowadays to remember it all|pg||
nt|mikeirl: direct 6c would be good|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|roswolf: a very passive switch|pg||
nt|petergill: I like her club switch - it looks safest, looking at 26 cards. |pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|jtr: Oh well, who can quarrel with success?|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c6|pc|c3|nt|petergill: but it gives declarer some chance of an eventual endplay, perhaps|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|ady: passive for the moment  but will again have a problem when in with Q@D|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: the double diamond finesse isn't such a bad choice, in view of the 2@H bid, but it will work very badly here|pg||
pc|c9|nt|roswolf: staying passive on these hands is often wise - let declarer do the work|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mikeirl: luckly start NI|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|ady: now declarer can get home on and end play|pg||
nt|henryb:  we all can. The Aces in their heyday would have fined N-S for this result|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c8|pc|cK|nt|jtr: How much?|pg||
nt|jtr: worth it for $50|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|rmb1: Needed to play @S when in with @DQ|pg||
nt|petergill: I think Fiona will strip the hand then lead a spade to the jack. The alternative line is to play East for @SA|pg||
nt|ady: dont think passive on this hand good enough|pg||
nt|athene: yes, declarer can cash things and strip west's non-spade cards then duck a spade to her|pg||
nt|paulg:  a hand where you will make more tricks in 1NT than a higher contract|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: but there are lots of losing alternatives (such as a diamond finesse)|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d7|nt|paulg:  you'd probably finesse the clubs if you were higher|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|roswolf: still not clear|pg||
nt|rmb1: Declarer can read West for spade honours after weak jump overcall by East|pg||
nt|athene: north can't get a count on the distribution - east could have another spade in place of the @D10|pg||
nt|petergill: North has to guess who has @SA, in order to make. If East had @SA and thus 11 HCP, she might overcall 1@H, not 2@H, though Cook is opposite a passed hand, so it's not clear. |pg||
nt|roswolf: agreed|pg||
nt|petergill: Declarer first has to pick @d's|pg||
pc|dK|pc|s2|pc|d8|pc|dT|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think $50 for South|pg||
pc|d5|nt|jtr: Per @h?:)|pg||
pc|s4|pc|h2|pc|h3|pg||
nt|ady: now down|pg||
pc|d6|nt|roswolf: should be |pg||
pc|h6|nt|athene: i think declarer was inclined to put east with the @SQ from her repeated refusal to lead one|pg||
