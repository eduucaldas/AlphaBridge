nt|brolucius: Not a big fan of 3NT on a hand with that potential elsewhere.|pg||
nt|brolucius: With eight clubs and a king, you are much closer to 5@C than your normal 3NT opening.|pg||
nt|lestergold: that call likes like a slam missing bid on classic uses of that bid|pg||
nt|brolucius: A kibitzer tells me that he would lead the @HQ from the East hand. Ah...|pg||
nt|diablo666: It´s a difficult lead, but not an impossible.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Whar else...?|pg||
nt|lestergold: however as it happens you don ot really want to play anywhere other than 3N|pg||
nt|hawe45:  What|pg||
mb|5C|mb|d|nt|ritong: leading the highest card of your hand might be a good martingale, but dubious:-)|pg||
nt|po-s: west might TO-"double" with 4C|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 5@c is right sided but wrongly doubled!!|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Shows that 3NT is a silly bid to show a solid suit. If 3NT is the spot, it's usually wrong-sided|pg||
nt|brolucius: West will not enjoy the appearance of the dummy.|pg||
nt|po-s: well---- HQ.HQ, HQ|pg||
nt|hawe45:  North must feel well now - about two extra tricks in the bag|pg||
nt|lestergold: but here 5@c wouold be wrong sided played by north ironically|pg||
mb|p|nt|diablo666: will only cost 1 imp :) .|pg||

mb|p|nt|ady: 2@H open room so will be a push|pg||
pc|h5|nt|sybarra: do we have running scores Jacco?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: last time i saw Owen in Tri City (West Columbia) sectional, he is 21 y.o., educating in Economics branch in NC State College|pg||
pc|h4|nt|xenya: well EW can make 6@D|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|szalay: ok, u can try 6@D, but its terrible...long run I dont suggest slams with 30 hcp and 2 balanced hands|pg||
nt|szalay: bid your games, take your tricks (by Hamman) is good advice in any level|pg||
nt|sybarra: I take it this is the "slam try" sequence |pg||
nt|szalay: with aceless 11, with Qx @C I wd just say 3N, confess|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: I think east made a slamtry here, that is what i heard from the explanation from west|pg||
nt|szalay: a bit starnge 3@C rebid except its forcing (doubt it) with 9 top tricks|pg||
mc|13|nt|szalay: if it was slamtry, West wd accept for sure|pg||

nt|lestergold: looks to me as if 4@s is one off|pg||
nt|brolucius: What masterstroke is South thinking of?|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|hawe45:  If East cashes 3 x @H - West is squeezed in red suits - for 10 tricks|pg||
nt|brolucius: "Surely there must be some other bid than 4@S on this hand..."  Oh, my comment was out of place. He has bid 5@S.|pg||

mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|szalay: if u go to normal games: go as fast as u can...dont give them chance to interfere|pg||
nt|sybarra: probably a preemptive @D raise coming |pg||
nt|szalay: why not 4@H with passed pd?|pg||
nt|frankaus: Ax no the best stopper in the world often better played from Qx side|pg||
nt|szalay: slam is unlikely, @H are good, so?|pg||
nt|sybarra: but unlikely to keep e/w out of 4 @H |pg||
nt|sybarra: you had the one with the picture |pg||
mb|4S|nt|sybarra: the website|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like 12 tricks for me....previous hand|pg||

nt|h_karluk: so far EW 5@c-1 and NS 4@s -1|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|sybarra: and E with 4333....|pg||
nt|szalay: wd u bid 5@D over 1@D-4@H-?|pg||
nt|sybarra: this may go 2 @H all pass |pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: yes but that is a blog|pg||
nt|ady: n/s likely to play 2@H|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|nt|yuval10: 4@s is some bid by N, P has a very good support though|pg||
nt|yuval10: and now probably bid 5@s ?|pg||
mb|5S|nt|sybarra: ir 2 @C all pass |pg||
mb|d|nt|szalay: why not double by South?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: best spot for n/s is clubs  but unable to get there|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: traffic light is red pays to be conservative|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh well what do I know |pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: e-w gave them all the chance|pg||
nt|xenya: they might get to a hopeless slam now -- and they did|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 @S?  rkk ? |pg||
nt|szalay: u can beat 5@C if u play some special (lavinthal, roman) signal over A of @S|pg||
pc|hA|nt|szalay: I think first step to trap was 1@H...after that they came deeper and deeper|pg||

pc|h3|pc|hT|pg||

pc|s5|pc|sQ|pc|s6|pg||

pc|h8|nt|sybarra: oh well |pg||
pc|h4|pc|s2|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @d9 was indeed a slip in defense - either @hJ or small @c would work better|pg||
pc|s3|pc|c5|pc|sT|nt|xenya: if E has @CA and a spade honour, slam is quite good -- perhaps too much to ask for? |pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hQ|pc|s7|pc|c3|pg||
nt|ady: sorry did not see 2@C bid   but was presumably a transfer to 2@D |pg||

nt|szalay: btw udca is better, cause u cant do this kinda "automatic mistake"|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: but E did bid 5@C -- seems that's what W was eager to hear|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: South could have 18+ balanced or any 5-4, passing would be a gamble|pg||
nt|yuval10: cards lie very favourable for them|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|szalay: I think a tipical mistake to correct in junior age by coach(es): stop slam-greedy|pg||

mb|p|nt|frankaus: put me down as a pass with Wests hand - aceless 4333 even with 14 i would pass|pg||

nt|Walddk2: All results (including butlers and hand records) at www.nbbportal.nl/1003/ > 'competitie'|pg||

nt|szalay: best defence is: cash 3 winners and @C|pg||
pc|c8|nt|szalay: in my book that is a slamtry in M, balanced|pg||
nt|szalay: to lose balanced slamtry with 6bagger is gap, anyway|pg||

nt|szalay: no ruffing finesse is suggested|pg||
nt|szalay: no 100% line, and could be lead from doubleton, but that is the best line, imho|pg||
nt|h_karluk: because you have 2 aces and 3 times trumps, whenever you are in can easily work to cut a ruff|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|xenya: Poland got the 11 imps back quickly, when they stopped in game on 2 (6@H was the contract here) |pg||

pc|d7|pc|dT|pc|d2|pg||

nt|szalay: btw with bare KQ I suggest to take fist with King..but: if pd doesnt continue after Q-K: doesnt have more|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|szalay: in my humble opinion this level of the play is not good at U20 yet|pg||
nt|frankaus: -470 is not a good number on a scoresheet|pg||
nt|szalay: I think at least 8 serious mistakes in 8 bds|pg||
nt|ady: 20-20 again   no fit    |pg||
nt|ady: whoever plays likely to go down|pg||
nt|yuval10: very quick session it was|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|ady: this has esculated|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|szalay: 2@D: NF (std Polish approx.)|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: 3@C was @S raise|pg||
nt|sybarra: undoubled, that is good news |pg||
nt|ady: even undoubled  east west will lose several imps|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: OR led @d, let's see if they'll lead it again here|pg||
nt|yuval10: perhaps will opt to a @s|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d7|pc|dT|pc|d2|pg||
pc|d3|nt|szalay: I confess I could pass as East automatically|pg||
nt|szalay: over 1@C|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sybarra: may make 6 now |pg||
pc|d5|nt|frankaus: pass is the hardest bid to master in bridge :)|pg||
nt|szalay: light openings and overcalls they style can live cause another side|pg||
nt|ady: heart shift  best|pg||
nt|rnmalik: no other choice I think|pg||
nt|ady: hand 16 where west was down 1 in 4@H doubled   in OR  n/s made 4@D re-doubled|pg||
nt|ady: was 11 imps for world team|pg||
nt|rnmalik: compensation here for NS might gain some|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c7|pc|c3|pc|c6|pg||
pc|h5|nt|szalay: u wont punish for light openings cause light overcalls and vica versa|pg||
nt|szalay: why not to take @C in hand?|pg||
nt|szalay: to start @D ruff?|pg||
nt|frankaus: maybe planning on a dummy reversal|pg||
pc|hT|nt|sybarra: he may be thinking same thing,  maybe played too fast |pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hQ|pc|s2|pc|h3|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ady: now K@C and club|pg||
pc|d8|pc|h4|nt|szalay: to take trick first and think thereafter isnt a good omen|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|sybarra: why not pitch ht|pg||
nt|sybarra: or is that the exit card?|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s7|nt|rnmalik: @H pitchwas better but kept an exit card|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|szalay: why Ten?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that was the question|pg||
pc|sA|pg||

mb|2H|mb|d!|mb|3H|mb|4C|mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hK|nt|lestergold: after the heart return he had to use spade entry to dummy to lead clubs from dummy tghereby losing three spades a club a diamond and a  heart|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|pc|h9|pg||
nt|ralfwil: no chance in 5@c without a mistake in the defence|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Playing carefully only one down here - by minor-luck|pg||
nt|Walddk2: All results (including butlers and hand records) on www.nbbportal.nl/1003/ > 'competitie'|pg||
nt|brolucius: The N/S bidding made life awkward for E/W. East's fifth club was not compulsory.|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4@c was not forcing surely?|pg||
nt|vugraphzef: I think X was explained as GF|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5@c simply an overbid|pg||
nt|lestergold: game forcing with that 7 count!?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Oh, they are playing a strong club system and the double forced to game?|pg||
nt|diablo666: East stretched the first time, 4clubs was forcing.|pg||
nt|brolucius: I see. Well, that is fair enough.|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h5|nt|lestergold: i wouldnt have thought that east's hand warranted a game force opposite a precision club opener|pg||
pc|hA|pc|c3|pg||
nt|ritong: big @c is fragile when preempted, nil novo sub sole  hello everybody|pg||
nt|hawe45:  East is quilty with 51 % - West the rest|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c7|pc|c4|pc|c2|pg||
nt|hawe45:  2 x @C and 4 x @D now|pg||
nt|diablo666: Can´t see why west should be blamed at all.|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c8|pc|cK|pc|c6|pg||
nt|lestergold: i agree west has a n enormous hand|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Depends on system, if he has (allready) showed reverse-stranght, he has nothing to add|pg||
nt|hawe45:  strenght|pg||
nt|brolucius: East may have been a point short of forcing to game, but the alternative of a pass might have been an even less accurate description. Sometimes you have to choose between too much ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: and too little.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Perhaps I could agree with 5@c if a @s was a @c (For sure he had put a @s among the @c:))|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Or maybe two...|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|pc|dA|pc|d7|pg||
nt|lestergold: hands like east's need caution i usually find my strong partner has a singleton club and my hand is reduced to a working K|pg||
nt|brolucius: I thought we were told that the auction was game-forcing, in which case he could not possibly pass 4@C.|pg||
nt|diablo666: East can´t pass 4 clubs once he has X:ed 2hearts, 4c is forcing....|pg||
nt|lestergold: here all his kings were working and it wasnt enuf for game|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d9|pc|dK|pc|d8|pg||
nt|hawe45:  In fact the 10th trick is very lucky|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dT|pc|dQ|nt|lestergold: swop K@d with K@h and the contract would have been totally absurd|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|d5|pc|h4|pc|cJ|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|s4|nt|brolucius: Yes, they had a minor-suit fit and no stopper in the opponents' strong suit, so easy to get too high.|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sJ|pc|sK|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h7|nt|diablo666: I think we will see more 24hcp games by both sides :) .|pg||

nt|vugraphzeg: last hand of this session|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: actually this is an u25 tournament not u20 as one of the commentators mentioned|pg||

nt|szalay: I know its U25|pg||

nt|ady: thx all|pg||
nt|sybarra: Thanks also to our specs who give us helpful comments and some humor!|pg||
nt|szalay: does West have way to show @D lead?|pg||
nt|szalay: or may be HIS lead, even better:)|pg||
nt|ady: if west is on lead to 3NT  may choose a heart when east has shown majors|pg||
nt|szalay: a bit optimistic, but acceptable 5@C|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|sybarra: Thanks also to our specs who give us helpful comments and some humor!|pg||
nt|sybarra: we are back in about 1/2 hour |pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: yes play went very fast here so that is why|pg||
nt|szalay: fast play seldom means good|pg||
nt|frankaus: fine operating Jacco <clap> <clap> <clap> <clap>|pg||
nt|szalay: I think South has INV with @Cs, lets say 3@C is normal or 2N...|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|vugraphzeg: it was west thinking but i try to do 2 bids at a time|pg||
nt|sybarra: this looks like it should make |pg||
nt|szalay: r u sure?|pg||
nt|xenya: i wonder|pg||
nt|szalay: 1@S, 1@H and how many @Cs?|pg||
nt|ady: looks like west has mis understood partners bid|pg||
nt|szalay: its Molenaar's double session|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: west might have explained this as weak with @d|pg||
nt|h_karluk: imho 5@c unbelievable|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: possibly 3@s would come|pg||
mb|4H|nt|szalay: I think its going down for @S lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: yikes!!  here we go again|pg||
nt|szalay: 6@C for sure|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: East wasnt passing, I could tell you that|pg||
nt|xenya: E seems to have taken partner's 4@C too seriously|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: E likes his hand|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|szalay: if u travel across the World, better to agree 2suiter overcalls|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: the problem was the semi natural 1@c openingbid i think|pg||
nt|szalay: if a bid (semi)natural, better to treat it as natural, eg. to play (1m)-2m as Michaels vs. prepared 1m yet|pg||
nt|sybarra: likely to misguess hts here also |pg||
nt|h_karluk: obviously - east players happy with that 7 hcp|pg||
nt|yuval10: maybe too much for a 4-3-3-3 hand|pg||
mb|5C|nt|szalay: but grand slam try with missing ace was a mistake, anyway|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: 1430, I guess|pg||
nt|xenya: admittedly, he does have a great hand|pg||
nt|szalay: nbo pressure for N-S now|pg||
nt|szalay: the real issue is 3m is nat or stopper asking|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|szalay: time for @S switch yet, and likely 2 off|pg||
nt|szalay: c u in 30 minutes|pg||
nt|szalay: byebye|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|h5|nt|frankaus: bed time here back latter in day european time|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: yes this happened, north couldnt play south for 4@D|pg||
nt|xenya: i doubt that -- W's clubs are too small|pg||
nt|xenya: setting up @Ds would mean seetting up trump tricks for N|pg||
nt|sybarra: cu frank @H |pg||
nt|xenya: but i overlooked the fact that the defence had presented E with a trick -- now he certainly can make 11 and must be thinking how to get 12  |pg||

pc|c4|nt|szalay: 2 off: +3|pg||
nt|ady: sorry  has to be less than 3 down |pg||
