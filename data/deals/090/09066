mb|1H|mb|p|nt|jtr: Then the Chinese gained 50 IMPs|pg||
mb|1S|nt|athene: welcome back everyone|pg||
mb|2D|nt|jtr: Start with a slam|pg||
mb|3H|nt|athene: north has a huge hand for a Precision 1@H|pg||
nt|jtr: Tough to bid though|pg||
nt|mdgraham: They have put together some massive sets over the years - I remember a 76-0 demolition in one of the Venice Cup matches|pg||
nt|athene: south will be thinking of 6@H now|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|mb|6D|nt|mdgraham: so is North, by the look of it|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: hi Peter|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 6@H may well be doubled for a spade lead|pg||
nt|athene: i thought the normal way to show a void in response to RKCB was to bid 5NT with an even number of keycards|pg||
nt|jtr: Not so tough for these ladies it seems|pg||
nt|petergill: NS play Strong Club|pg||
nt|petergill: hence 3@H, since 1@H was 11-15|pg||
nt|athene: i thought 6@D would show a diamond void and an ODD number of keycards|pg||
mb|6H|nt|mdgraham: which will not, unfortunately, do any good |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: well, i am sure they know what they are doing|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, I'd have doubled for a spade lead, and would be -1210|pg||
nt|athene: even without a spade fit, north has the most she can possibly have for 1@H, so as soon as her partner shows any slam interest, she is going there|pg||
nt|petergill: Well bid, 4NT RKCB, 6@D two key cards plus @D void. |pg||
nt|mdgraham: the @CQ is a bonus|pg||
nt|vugraphzhp: 6@d = @d void with 2 or 3 keycards.|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: thirteen tricks now if she wants them|pg||
nt|jtr: 2 OR 3 seems odd|pg||
nt|athene: yes, that seems a bit silly|pg||
nt|mdgraham: doesn't seem a bit silly - seems totally unplayable|pg||
nt|athene: you might easily be missing a grand slam with south showing 2 or 3 keycards|pg||
nt|vugraphzhp: i think so too, but that's what explained.|pg||
nt|petergill: Without @CQ in her side suit (source of tricks), South would not have encouraged a slam - she would have bid 4@h instead of 4@D. |pg||
nt|athene: if you are ever going to have ambiguous responses they have to be widely differentiated so partner knows what you have|pg||
nt|athene: hence 0 or 3 keycards, 1 or 4|pg||
nt|jtr: Sensible lead in a way|pg||
nt|jtr: East knows South is likely to have only 2 or 3 trumps and the ruff may be important|pg||
nt|athene: i wonder if there was any significance in west's failure to double diamond bids|pg||
nt|athene: forcing dummy might well be right to prevent the establishment of a black suit|pg||
nt|jtr: South responded 2@c next door and they were much better placed|pg||
nt|athene: i try to persuade my partners not to lead trumps against small slams|pg||
pc|h8|nt|athene: the only excuse for so doing is it's right :)|pg||
pc|h9|nt|petergill: Both teams of six not surprisingly have their top four players in action for this vital last 16 boards of the grand final|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|jtr: Concerned about 4-1 @cs|pg||
nt|jtr: and 3-1@hs|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s3|nt|jtr: yes i thought she might do that|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sA|pg||
nt|jtr: Leaves options open and may be important for a squeeze|pg||
nt|petergill: "Fluffy" on BBO forums has a good problem in the top-listed Forum thread about whether to lead a trump against a slam of not, ref www.bridgebase.com then forums. Fluffy (in the ...|pg||
nt|petergill: Latin team) missed the Finals by 1 imp in the NEC Cup.     |pg||

nt|cliveo: The Irish team have already built up a large lead; they are on 56 VPs after three matches, 9 VPs ahead of three teams in equal second, England A, England B and Northern Ireland. ...|pg||
nt|cliveo: Wales are not far behind on 43. So if Wales win they are back in the hunt. It's an important morning for them|pg||

nt|mariner1: no games here,,,,,,,|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzgj: sorry - sleeping|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 5-5 in clubs who cares any more?|pg||
nt|cliveo: As you can see, the Irish have an aggressive opening style|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and 4-4 in D by opps|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 5-4|pg||
mb|3S|nt|cliveo: Which makes it difficult for them to find their 5-5 club fit|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and us ordinary mortals go 1S-1Nt-2C and bops your uncle|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: a conservative pass by N|pg||
nt|mariner1: hi Al :)|pg||
nt|woozle: of course, NS didn't even think about such a foolish game|pg||
mb|4C|nt|henryb: Not so conservative when partner's range is 14-16|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we're at it again, aye Rob|pg||
nt|mariner1: not a lot of action expected on this board.|pg||
nt|woozle: might make 5 if East doesn't return a diamond|pg||
nt|mariner1: take that back, 4@H has play|pg||
nt|mariner1: not that they will be in game ever here|pg||

mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5H|nt|ahollan1: i don't think i've Moscito from anyone other than Pan Asian players [including Australia & New Zealand]|pg||
mb|p|nt|cliveo: Although in a 6-1 fit, and the suit breaking 4-2, Garvey can make this contract if he plays on hearts or clubs|pg||

pc|d2|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h9|nt|henryb: I wonder why people insist on winning the @dK. The @dQ is more deceptive actually|pg||

pc|h4|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sK|pc|h7|pc|s3|pg||

pc|s4|pg||
nt|mdgraham: to be fair, after (say) 1N-p-p-2@S, it's not clear that South would go on |pg||
nt|athene: i believe Mark Horton was one of the first people to espouse this style - it's just much harder to bid game into a live, unlimited auction|pg||

pc|c9|nt|petergill: When the opponenns bid at fav vul, and are young (well, in their thirties) and dashing bidders like Furuta and Chen are, they might well be "stealing" from you. |pg||
nt|athene: actually i think the 1nt rebid did the damage - if east passes south will bid 1nt and now north will be more likely to bid game|pg||

mb|1S|mb|1N|nt|Walddk4: Good morning David, Phil and Clive|pg||

nt|woozle: that might silence everybody|pg||
nt|mariner1: even 7@S|pg||
nt|mariner1: ruff out 2@D and claim|pg||
nt|ahollan1: I sure hope 2@H is transfer showing contructive @S raise or better|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: mm both thought of bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: hi all|pg||
nt|cliveo: However, Kurbalija stopped the spades being introduced|pg||
nt|woozle: or not...3D is an interesting effort|pg||
mb|2S|nt|woozle: probably about down one|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i must say -- 1@D was flawless|pg||
nt|woozle: 3D might get some partscores right, but it carries big risks, like missing spade games|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but even if it does - this doesn't look like best way to start describing the hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: ok|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Hi Sharyn and John|pg||
nt|sharynr: hey Roland and John :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hi Shariyn|pg||
nt|vugraphzgj: having a few connections problems.  Going to try taking computer back into room now it is connected!!|pg||
nt|sharynr: John, would you have bid over 2D?|pg||
nt|sharynr: with the south hand, that is /|pg||
nt|jcomyn: plenty of hcp but distribution not helpful|pg||
nt|sharynr: I agree|pg||
nt|jcomyn: depends on partner. Not sure|pg||
nt|jcomyn: keep attacking trumps|pg||
nt|sharynr: well the "math" seems to lean toward passing...since the most you can expect is a bad 9 from pard|pg||
nt|sharynr: I wonder if there is still a connection problem|pg||
nt|jcomyn: looks likely|pg||
nt|henryb: this should be 2 down|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes it does seem an unusual call|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil_20686: Al together too early for bridge IMO, alarm felt awfully early this morning :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Forrester - Bakhshi  E-W  for England|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Adamson - Martin   N-S  for Scotland|pg||
nt|mariner1: can they find the nice slam here?|pg||
mb|p|nt|cliveo: Interestingly, both England and Scotland run trials to select their teams, and have not had a good result in the Camrose for some years with this method, whereas the Republic of ...|pg||
nt|cliveo: Ireland have picked the same team year in, year out, and have not been beaten for some years|pg||
nt|vugraphzgj: connection problems :(|pg||
nt|cliveo: You will find that every year, the composition of the English and Scottish teams is totally different from the previous year|pg||
nt|cliveo: Indeed, England won the silver medal at the Beijing Mind Games and yet only one pair from that team is playing this weekend|pg||
nt|jcomyn: club|pg||
nt|woozle: pass would have likely scored +50 - diamond lead, spade switch|pg||
nt|mariner1: so 2@H had to have been @S support|pg||
nt|ahollan1: without knowing all the NS agreements -- this sequence sounds like 3@D=game try|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm just assuming transfer responses over the Takeout DBL|pg||
nt|mariner1: I like the 2@H treatment here....|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i like it for game investigation, but looks cumbersome for slam invite|pg||
nt|ahollan1: North doesn't know if jump was because of @D honors - or shortness|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|cliveo: If Garvey wins and switches to a club this should go one off|pg||
nt|sga1: No looks -1|pg||
pc|d5|nt|cliveo: Adamson-Martin are one of the top lady Scottish pairs, and have done very well to win their place. The Scots, in fact, have three ladies in their team as Liz McGowan is playing ...|pg||
nt|cliveo: with David Liggatt|pg||
pc|d8|nt|phil_20686: It has always been my feeling that straight teams trials will seldom produce the best team|pg||
nt|ady: the hearts in the South hand are not strong enough to win twice  otherwise 4@S could go down|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sga1: sry u r right|pg||
nt|henryb: 3@c, 2@h and a @d|pg||
nt|sga1: Not any more|pg||
nt|woozle: now maybe club, club, third club for the trump demotion|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what is bug's option?   Neg DBL -- but no rebid after 3@H, PASS hoping for reopening double - then ?3@S?|pg||
nt|woozle: I'd pass, then 4S|pg||
pc|sA|nt|jcomyn: and one off|pg||
nt|henryb: but now may make|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@H must be 1st or 2nd round control - and very discouraging for North - who now knows 4@S was based upon @D shortness rather than honors|pg||
nt|mariner1: does S see slam now?|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s4|pg||
nt|Walddk4: what about a trump lead?|pg||
nt|xenya: i don't see how S could bid slam, aceless|pg||
nt|mariner1:  this board could be a big key in match,,,,, since 6 and 7 also make if bid|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|cliveo: I agree with Phil|pg||
nt|Walddk4: That would be very inconvenient for declarer|pg||
nt|ahollan1: welcome to no-man's land  2   [ 1=2N,  2=5Major,  3=3Major,  4=4minor]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Hsiangwen hears an auction that screams for a trump lead and does so -- then looks at the rest of his hand|pg||
pc|s9|nt|mariner1: trump lead as good as any here........ he looks Zugzwang on the opening lead|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ady: Forester m  ust be carefull to p lay 8@H 2nd time if playing from hand|pg||
nt|phil_20686: does not matter, North has no smaller ones left in any event|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but doesnt 4S make|pg||
nt|henryb: will in fact|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now we know double dummy that declarer can take all the tricks -- but at Imps -- first find line to ensure 11 tricks|pg||
nt|mariner1: he heard the @H cue so no @H and @c nor @D looks attractive|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|mariner1: 1st mistake would be assuming you have 4 @c tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or even 2 :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: true|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ady: does not matter as AJ109 now in north hand|pg||
nt|cliveo: Some people might think this defence is routine, but time after time the Irish are so accurate in these situations|pg||
pc|sT|nt|xenya: actually it's not a great slam, looking at NS's hands|pg||
pc|h4|pc|d3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and as here -- how do you feel if 3@C all pass?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: point for the audience -- sometimes preempts make bidding tough|pg||
nt|woozle: 3C all pass is fine - you're facing club length and probably make nothing|pg||
nt|woozle: A crossruff probably falls into 9 tricks here|pg||
nt|woozle: although West's diamond 8 may be a problem on the fourth round of hearts|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|phil_20686: North should probably have played one of the JT9 as a matter of technique on teh first round of hearts, but a minor slip|pg||

nt|athene: i.e. west can't have a great hand with spades (no 1@S overcall)|pg||
nt|athene: but she MIGHT have a great hand with hearts|pg||
nt|athene: probably showing hearts naturally isn't an issue so much over a 5-card major|pg||
nt|athene: but when opener has bid a minor it might well be|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: North goes for the throat|pg||

nt|petergill: Hong Li is ranked 9th in the world, for women's bridge.|pg||

mb|d|nt|sharynr: NS stopped low enough, East must have been disappointed in the closed room, defending 2@H with an overtrick|pg||

nt|woozle: very good play once the heart ace is onside|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: here we go early on a 9-count|pg||
nt|cliveo: John, can you tell us where Garvey and Carroll are based, and whether they play in competitions together outside of internationals?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: still should have been 1 diamond left to dispose of round loser :(|pg||
mb|5D|nt|phil_20686: How close do the panel think this is to a 3@c bid?|pg||
mb|p|nt|cliveo: Once again the aggressive tactics of the Irish have kept the Welsh out of the bidding, though the Welsh have 24 points and a probable heart game|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil_20686: Feels close to me, the Kx@s looks like a big holding now|pg||
nt|ady: 6 NT  or 6@C   or 6@S all make    not 6@D|pg||
nt|cliveo: We all know how fine a player Tony is, but he is a particularly strong declarer|pg||
nt|ady: there is a danger of 6@D here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I don't think so|pg||
nt|ady: if Martin gets diamond preference   he might back peddle with a jack high suit|pg||
nt|phil_20686: North will offer 6@c as a matter of course, almost irrespective of how the auction develops|pg||
nt|henryb: 5@d is also reasonable|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i like the 3-card @S raise|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Kieran wins the cupie doll -- i hoped someone would mention 1@C with balanced and transfer responses|pg||
nt|woozle: I usually play 2NT after 1x-1y:2y as a 1-round force, after which 3 card raises bid out shape|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N is overbid - punishes partner for opening sub-strength distrbutional hands|pg||
nt|mariner1: my guess is he played out all the trumps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but reopening DBL with that @H holding is .... non-optimal|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: yes TG is in England and JC works in Dublin. No they dont play too often outside internationals. In fact John won the Irish Masters playing with Adam Mesbur|pg||
nt|ahollan1: have any of you played the follow-up to determine if opener has made 3 or 4 card raise?|pg||
nt|woozle: my style rebids 1NT (or opens 1C and plays transfer responses) - I like the raise to suggest four so that partner can jump to game more often|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|Walddk4: N-S are women   Sheila - Anne|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mariner1: Q@H is an imaginative lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure anybody follows this anymore, but I learned bidding after reopening DBL to first subtract a King, then bid accordingly|pg||
pc|hK|nt|cliveo: I think it unlikely they will bid a slam as with the first set yesterday evening, the cards do lie well for declarer|pg||
nt|phil_20686: (provided only that they get to the 6 level)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hmm -- i hadn't seen the 1 round force treatment before |pg||
nt|ahollan1: duh -- 2N as 1-round force|pg||
nt|mariner1: I like to play 2@C asking over a major, outlawed by ACBL until recently|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that makes West a solid 1N bid|pg||
nt|mariner1: p did bid them so reasonable..... and N has no entry|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|mariner1: sort of like drury in but also in 1st and 2nd seat|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Rob -- you mean like Gazzilli?|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h2|nt|ady: now South should get the message and if going to the 6 level  clubs rather than diamonds|pg||
nt|cliveo: what do we make of the 3@d bid - agreeing the suit, or a cue-bid? or even something else?|pg||
nt|mariner1: no|pg||
nt|woozle: 4S now has an overtrick on the menu|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|phil_20686: This hand shows the powed of the mixed cue, the k@c is such a big card in the north hand, Many club players still play cues as ace showing, which is inferior|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's natural where I come from|pg||
nt|phil_20686: she just showed a GF raise in diamonds|pg||
pc|hT|nt|sga1: They r playing 2@s as Baron.|pg||
nt|sga1: I mean 1N - 2@s|pg||
pc|h8|nt|henryb: declarer should actually play a second high heart, then @cA and a @c. |pg||
nt|mariner1: he has time to setup the @c for 2 tricks now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: at this vulnerability - with that @H holding, East knows that West does not have strong hand hoping to defend, so pass and defend well for 100 a trick is much better plan|pg||
pc|c4|pc|d6|pg||
nt|phil_20686: could even be 4@d depending on their agreement for inverted minors|pg||
nt|phil_20686: and that pass was unexpected|pg||
nt|cliveo: Well that shows how much we understood of their sequence!|pg||
nt|cliveo: Perhaps the key is that 4@c was not alerted, whereas 2@h, 3@s, 4@h and 4@s all were|pg||
nt|phil_20686: Pass is clearly anti-system, after that many cue bids, but south is worred about her poor diamonds, and opted to get out in a positive|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: we saw a very similar hand last set|pg||
nt|athene: 4333 18 count|pg||
nt|petergill: Liu Yi Qian took 9 years off after playing for China from 1992 to 1995, hence her "lowly" ranking of 30th best female in the world. |pg||
mb|1S|nt|athene: then south has a borderline decision|pg||
mb|1N|nt|athene: but might well apply the axe of judgement|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@S Precision, 11-15, 5+ @S|pg||
mb|d|mb|2D|an|transfer|nt|athene: indeed the axe is wielded|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|athene: but E-W have an 8-card heart fit, and you aren't allowed to double people in an 8-card fit at the 2-level, so they are safe|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: why aren't you allowed to double?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: it's against the law|pg||
nt|athene: also to be fair it's rarely right|pg||
nt|petergill: Both these Chinese pairs play Precision. Precision was invented in the early 1970s in China by C.C. Wei with assistance from his wife Kathy. |pg||

mb|p|nt|ady: part score in diamonds   |pg||
nt|cliveo: to return to the question of selection, and I know how difficult it is because I was chairman of a rugby selection committee for over 5 years, there has been a lack of consistency ...|pg||
nt|cliveo: in the selection of the England teams. For example Bell and Byrne were not selected for the U28 team in Beijing, and yet have been selected for the England B open team, where ...|pg||
nt|cliveo: indeed they showed their ability yesterday with a very good first 16 boards against the A team|pg||
nt|jcomyn: these tactics won buckets of imps against Scotland - or is it bouquets of imps|pg||
nt|cliveo: Again, they have 24 points between them, but this time Rees was able to get into the action before the Irish had a chance!|pg||
mb|1D!|an|NEG|nt|mariner1: @c good lead|pg||

mb|p|nt|jcomyn: gone crazy again|pg||

nt|mariner1: now S in a spot|pg||
nt|xenya: i certainly would |pg||
nt|mariner1: yes 4 @S looks reasonable to me too......|pg||
nt|ahollan1: declarer much better off if he knows about the @C10 lead - i.e. can it be from interior sequence or not|pg||
nt|ahollan1: IF possibly interior sequence, @C6 would have been good shot -- 2 minutes ago|pg||
mb|2D!|an|TRF|nt|cliveo: The bidding sequences of our top players are so different to the sequences played at our local clubs that it is very difficult for aspiring players to learn from the experts|pg||
nt|mariner1: @D lead here makes this tough|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: then 3C 2425?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ady: 1@H  re-bid shows spades I think|pg||
nt|henryb: harder if you play 2/1 gf. but then you respond 1N|pg||
nt|sga1: yes.|pg||
mb|p|nt|cliveo: I agree, otherwise the sequence makes no sense|pg||
nt|phil_20686: I have always found it easy - just ask, top players are normally happy to help, and they all played natural systems once|pg||
nt|jcomyn: will they find it again?|pg||
nt|cliveo: If the Irish keep up their impressive form on defence, this contract will be 1 off after the first four tricks|pg||
nt|jcomyn: Tommy may lead a S however|pg||
nt|cliveo: And as we can see, Ireland got 11 IMPs back on Board 3 through the aggressive tactics of Garvey and Carroll in this room|pg||
nt|vugraphzgj: Carroll tried to lead OOT but Rees stopped him :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: sure he did before CJ hit the table|pg||
nt|vugraphzgj: exactly|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: which Ace is the problem|pg||
nt|jcomyn: looking for a signal|pg||
mb|p|nt|cliveo: yes, but unless you meet the top players personally to speak to them, that is not available to the ordinary club player|pg||
nt|jcomyn: quick arent they|pg||

nt|cliveo: Convention cards for all the pairs playing this weekend can be found at http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2007/camroseteams.htm|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ahhh -- non-transfer moscito|pg||
nt|woozle: West has plenty of controls, maybe 3H showed a min|pg||
nt|ahollan1: of all the red suits -- that @H3 and @HQ were the only ones NOT worth consideration|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ady: 3@D  was a bit pushy on such a tepid suit   |pg||
nt|ahollan1: Kieran - are you a Mosciot convert?|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|sga1: on a trump lead and continuation, real problem for declarer.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or even Moscito|pg||
nt|woozle: No, but I have played relay before|pg||
nt|woozle: looks fairly vanilla|pg||
nt|ahollan1: are these basically Symmetric Relay based?|pg||
nt|woozle: looks like symmetric|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jcomyn: oh dear he let me down|pg||
pc|cA|nt|woozle: Not sure about the last two bids by West though - he's loaded with controls, I would have thought he'd be taking up more steps|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|pg||
nt|henryb: now a @h towards dummy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: while bidding continues - my favorite relay story -- 1st hand of 2007 Reisinger, kibitzing Burgess-Marston|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they used ALL bids between 1@C and 2N -- BOTH opponents ran out of PASS cards|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|Walddk4: Good morning to Jim Hay from Scotland|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ahh: morning everyone |pg||
nt|woozle: My favourite, B-M again, is where they relayed to the five level without skipping a step. At that point, Burgess realised that they were both relaying, figured out what he'd shown ...|pg||
nt|woozle: and what Marston needed to keep bidding for so long, and placed the contract correctly|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hK|pg||
nt|henryb: should have pitched @c|pg||
nt|ahollan1: more than bidding accuracy, relay may gain more just on increasing blind opening lead syndrome|pg||

nt|cliveo: their results|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|h9|nt|woozle: It's often inferior when the replier has extra playing strength, or when the described hand is going to be declarer|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|cliveo: there are obviously a lot of good people in Scotland then|pg||
nt|ahh: pleased to see our debut girls holding their own against   Englands strike  pair |pg||
nt|cliveo: unfortunately Jim, the 11 IMPs were due to an error by the English at the other table|pg||
nt|ahh: they bid the wrong slam |pg||

nt|woozle: Usual theory is to lead dummy's three card suit...leading dummy's short suits against 3NT is always doomed|pg||

nt|woozle: although 3NT may appeal to East, and it dies a quick death if fruitman finds a big heart|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharynr: I guess NS play sound overcalls|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: 5@D is pretty good|pg||
nt|cliveo: how would you rate the 3NT by Sime-Matheson on board 4?|pg||
nt|ahh: is that a weak strong jump or a strong weak jump ?|pg||
nt|sharynr: and NS did wel to score plus here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in [more] obnoxious days -- we would have described 2@S as "showing the values for a 2@S bid in this sequence"|pg||
nt|mariner1: he may cash a @H to look I would|pg||
nt|woozle: AKx often a great lead against 3NT|pg||
pc|h3|nt|jcomyn: boy oh boy|pg||
nt|cliveo: Surely Kurbalija hasn't passed here?|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|cliveo: yesterday, Townsend-Gold described their jumps as 'strongish', but they had 13 points|pg||
nt|cliveo: At my club even the LOLs would be jumping on the table|pg||
nt|cliveo: OK, that makes more sense|pg||
nt|sga1: Only 2@c makes for NS.|pg||
nt|henryb: and Wast will rescue North|pg||
nt|sga1: He did.|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ahh: hopefully better than the 1st board they played yesterday |pg||
nt|sga1: With a ratchet suit, he bids again after doubling.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S looks like automatic response to me -- but if you take away a King, then bypass the suit|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|ahh: 3nt -3|pg||
nt|Walddk4: why?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: oh, not this one|pg||
nt|ahh: ok it was  just only -2 |pg||
nt|phil_20686: I think openeing Sime's hand with that suit is poor|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 3NT is an awful contract, but it makes|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You actually need spades 6-3 with no entry to the long suit|pg||
nt|cliveo: does it definitely make on a @s lead?|pg||
nt|phil_20686: or the @d finesse working|pg||
nt|phil_20686: but that is anti-% given the bidding|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Right Clive, North can switch to hearts after 2 rounds of spades|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But will that happen?|pg||
nt|woozle: Big missed opportunity for NS|pg||
nt|xenya: 12 tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: move a small @C from declarer's hand to smal @S -- and 4@S is much better contract than 4@H|pg||
nt|mariner1: I suspect 11 :)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|cliveo: A kibbitzer has suggested two rounds of @s and a @h switch defeats the contract|pg||
pc|s6|nt|cliveo: Yes, it is easier in double dummy!|pg||
nt|cliveo: If Garvey makes all the right guesses, this is a good vulnerable save against a making non-vulnerable game|pg||

nt|sharynr: but VERY difficult to get there|pg||

nt|jcomyn: Howya Ciaran|pg||
nt|sharynr: hopefully we will see some bridge soon|pg||
nt|jcomyn: Dublin|pg||
nt|cliveo: In fact the last undertrick only cost 2 IMPs because of the result in the open room|pg||
nt|jcomyn: when he isnt off playing poker somewhere|pg||
nt|vugraphzgj: Garvey is shaking his head|pg||
nt|woozle: big double-fit hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i have some descriptions of the line -- weird is one with acceptable letter count|pg||
mb|p|nt|cliveo: In the open room, Board 5, they are playing in 3@d, so another swing to England|pg||
nt|woozle: NS make 3C or maybe 3S...EW make 11 tricks in either red suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 2@H Micheals now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the downside of Michaels -- North doesn't know - and in fact doubts there is a @C fit|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|jcomyn: excerllent slam here|pg||
nt|henryb: double by N?|pg||
nt|mariner1: EW can make 4@H....|pg||
nt|woozle: I'm not much of a fan of this style of Michaels - I'd have no idea whether to take another bid. 1S leaves you with much better information about your partner's hand|pg||
nt|mariner1: even 5@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|cliveo: It does show that with modern technology pairs can be very effective even though they live significant travelling distances from each other|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes they do a fair bit of work on the internet - the whole teram doers|pg||
nt|cliveo: We can see the Welsh pair got a good result in the open room|pg||
nt|jcomyn: team does|pg||
nt|woozle: 2S: Anything you can cue I can cue better|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ahh: if you always made the best opening lead  you would be worlds number 1 player for sure |pg||
nt|cliveo: Their international results show that hard work pays dividends, too|pg||
nt|jcomyn: not if 6H is bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Italians use Ghestem -- where they would show the 2 specific suits in one bid [but don't ask me which]|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: same start in open room|pg||
nt|woozle: Going fancy could cost a bit - 4H would have probably bought it; 3D might let North back in|pg||
mb|2C!|an|Relay|nt|cliveo: At the moment, when Bakhshi-Forrester play in a game, Sime-Matheson play in a part score, and vice versa|pg||
nt|cliveo: With any other pair, one would say highly unlikely. But with the way Garvey and Carroll have bid so far this session, who knows?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 5s pushes them to 6H|pg||
nt|cliveo: Rees may live to regret his bid|pg||
nt|henryb: no. we seem to be in the business of rescuing the opponents when they are in trouble|pg||
nt|sga1: He preferred 2@h|pg||
mb|d|nt|sga1: :)|pg||
mb|r|nt|jcomyn: and finish|pg||
nt|sharynr: and he buys very well!|pg||
nt|cliveo: Although, 6@s is a good save over 6@h :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: unless dbl of course|pg||
mb|2D|nt|ahh: this could have been sneaky 3nt on @S lead |pg||
nt|cliveo: we have a player in the north east called Bill March. If you ever find a lead other than fourth highest of your longest and strongest against 3NT you get many congratulations!|pg||
nt|ahh: but on non @S lead not so hot |pg||
nt|mariner1: I would bid a game as W|pg||
nt|ahollan1: endplayed at trick 1 :(|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: oops again|pg||
nt|cliveo: A lot of IMPs depend on Carroll's next bid|pg||
nt|mariner1: EW have 3N here no problem.. number of tricks only issue|pg||
nt|xenya: i can see 10|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: this is not good at all|pg||
nt|cliveo: And unfortunately for Ireland, in the negative column|pg||
mb|d|nt|mariner1: Zugzwang on the lead again :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Paul Marston would say - lead @H instead of @S -- Canape Leads - very interesting article from way back in last millenium|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: how could he know that his diamond honours are working... maybe there's some kind of clue|pg||
mb|2H|nt|jcomyn: this a lotta imps|pg||
nt|jcomyn: TG will be shaking his head again|pg||
nt|cliveo: A club from Garvey takes the contract two off|pg||
nt|cliveo: Provided Carroll then plays a diamond to the Ace and there is a second club ruff|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: only a @c continuation allows 6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: looks as thought West would have bid 2@S over 2@H or 1@S|pg||
nt|woozle: 2H over 1S might work as an asking bid - asking the opponents how many spades your partner has|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|cliveo: Not surprisingly, he played the Ace of diamonds first. Now will he find the club?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: he better|pg||
nt|cliveo: If he does, they lose 12 IMPs. If he doesn't, 17|pg||
nt|cliveo: Assuming, of course, my maths is correct!|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|jcomyn: 17 it is|pg||
nt|mariner1: so time for Joey here :)|pg||

pc|s5|pc|s4|nt|cliveo: According to their convention card, 3@s shows a singleton|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS can make 5@C|pg||

pc|sA|nt|ady: 4@S cetainly made life difficult for e/w|pg||

pc|s8|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes 4@H should make too|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what did 3@S accomplish?  was it a probe for 3N?   |pg||
nt|mariner1: takes @c lead to beat 4@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ok 3@H - but the inevitable 4@S down on @C ruffs|pg||
pc|sT|nt|cliveo: Anyone have any idea what 3NT means?|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|cliveo: I think generally the top Scottish players tend to be less aggressive at pre-empting than the top players from the South of England|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|mariner1: time for 3N|pg||
nt|mariner1: on 16 3@S here they bid 4 @S in Open...... made 5 here|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sharynr: playing for a heart diamond squeeze would do it, yes|pg||
nt|ciaran: probably cashed out and made 12 when @HQ dropped|pg||
nt|sga1: N may have realised and passed 5@s.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: checkback?   blast 4@H |pg||
pc|c9|nt|jcomyn: true although the first half of Ireland v EBU hands were dull enough|pg||
nt|cliveo: Yes, with the exception of one session where there was a succession of part scores, there has been a lot to keep us interested|pg||
nt|vugraphzgj: I'm wearing out my alert button :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hmm or 3@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: South really doesn't want to play @H unless Opener has 4 -- so I prefer checkback if it is available|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c3|pg||
nt|ahh: practical shot from Ann|pg||
nt|ady: 11 tricks in hearts     spade lead will come   so no chance of a slam slipping through|pg||
nt|cliveo: Ann is consistent in her bidding style with long suits|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hope they dont get any rushes of blood to the head here|pg||
nt|cliveo: In the other matches, England are losing to Northern Ireland, whereas the England B team have a comfortable lead over Scotland|pg||
nt|xenya: S might be considering a @D conract -- well both 3N and 5@D make|pg||
nt|mariner1: BTU mixed is about to take the lead|pg||
nt|mariner1: 16 was a 9 imp swing and a new leader, still very close|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what do you think of north's 2@S bid?  i'm trying to decide if 3@H or 3@C had merits [i.e. why introduce bad 4 card suit when partner known not to hold 4@S - else negative DBL]|pg||
nt|mariner1: danger here is S is trying to talk himself out of something.........|pg||
nt|ahollan1: are either of these 'mixed' NS players female?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ahh: opps bidding warned her off getting too high |pg||
nt|phil_20686: Slam looks awfully far away if partner cannot find a bid over 2@s, so no real danger in just bidding game|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and i meant blast 4@S|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4 of either major works|pg||
nt|mariner1: do not know|pg||
pc|s6|nt|henryb: I must confess I would not overcall 4@h. I think North's hand is far too strong|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mariner1: has to avoid 2 @H losers|pg||

nt|vugraphzgx: S: female N: Male|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|jcomyn: I smell 4NT|pg||
nt|cliveo: England have had a very poor record in recent years at the Camrose and now we have the B team leading the A team!|pg||
nt|cliveo: Indeed as the scores stand at the moment, the England B team is hot on the heels of Ireland|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes but you wouldnt call the EBU weak now would you|pg||
pc|s2|nt|xenya: oh |pg||
nt|ahollan1: thanks operator!|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|nt|cliveo: You say that John, but interestingly Bell and byrne, for example, were not considered strong enough to play in the U28 team at Beijing, but were selected for this event|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and has to avoid losing transportation before @S established|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|xenya: walking on thin ice now? |pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm intrigued by this hand -- have absolutely no idea about potential nuances|pg||
pc|cK|nt|cliveo: I am not criticising that selection, because Byrne in particular has a very impressive record with a wide variety of partners, but in our Premier League his team did not qualify ...|pg||
nt|cliveo: for the A division|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ahollan1: definitely best that East is on lead |pg||
pc|c5|pc|d2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: cashing @DA doesn't hurt at all - @S makes setting up that suit easy -- @C pitch @D|pg||
nt|mariner1: well they found a spot.....|pg||
pc|s9|nt|mariner1: 17 produced 1 imp so now a 3 imp match|pg||
pc|d6|nt|phil_20686: right i will take this opportunity to get some ribena|pg||
nt|jcomyn: so there yar and they beat England in the first round|pg||
nt|mariner1: so in control now|pg||
pc|sT|nt|sga1: absolutely. Basically a 4 loser hand only with rough LTC.|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|cA|nt|cliveo: It does show how difficult a selector's job is, and I have great sympathy with them because I was once chairman of a rugby selection committee for five years, and received the odd ...|pg||
nt|cliveo: criticism myself|pg||
nt|ahollan1: among other things -- did RDBL suggest a @H stopper or just stronger hand|pg||
pc|d8|nt|henryb: but then at my table the auction would start P-1@h-1@s-2@h|pg||
nt|xenya: i would assume the latter|pg||
pc|d7|pc|c4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: me too - so south never did show a stopper -- a puzzlement|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|h3|pc|dQ|pc|cT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice try with @HQ but it won't matter|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dK|pc|s4|nt|ahh: a junior drinking ribena  what on earth has the world come to ?|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i would have tried @H ruff first --- does it matter in the end?|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|nt|jcomyn: yes selectors are NEVER right especially in bridge asd we are all the best players in the world|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|xenya: perhaps S just didn't have time to show the stopper -- looks like 3@C shows shortage and 3@S completed the description of her hand |pg||

nt|petergill: NS play UDCA, lead 3/5 (suits) and 4th (NT), so @S8 was discouraging |pg||
nt|mdgraham: -170 on  56 may have been "least minus" for EW - if they do bid 4@H, NS are likely to "save" in 4@S over it - and that would take very sharp defence to have a chance of beating it  ...|pg||

nt|ciaran: at the other table|pg||
nt|vugraphzgj: still no connection - working in office |pg||
nt|sharynr: will make 4@h here, unless takes a @h finesse into North!. otherwise, a strip and endplay coming.|pg||
nt|sharynr: butopps can foil that by cashing spades |pg||
nt|ciaran: May go wrong if N opens 2S|pg||
nt|jcomyn: Hughe is not as green as he is cabbage-looking I assure you|pg||
nt|cliveo: We were discussing this during another match yesterday, and the conclusion was that the consistency of the Irish selection has a lot to do with its success|pg||
nt|jcomyn: ah part score at last|pg||
nt|vugraphzgj: East aplologising for not bidding six!|pg||
nt|henryb: as well he should|pg||
nt|ahollan1: result says +420, but I still prefer 4@S|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S here also|pg||
nt|xenya: this might be  costly|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: an easy 6NT|pg||
nt|phil_20686: I am a very old 22 year old, i like sherry and scotch in small doses|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|sga1: yes.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the very best NS can hope for is a push|pg||
mb|p|nt|cliveo: a teetotal scottish junior? whatever next!|pg||
nt|ady: not much difficulty here|pg||
nt|phil_20686: i think 5N will come out of the box here|pg||
nt|cliveo: yes, it would be a major surprise if they don't play in 6NT|pg||
mb|1H|nt|jcomyn: not selected Clive - they murdered the winners of our prelim trials in the final trial|pg||
nt|henryb: 6@h cold from N chair|pg||
mb|p|nt|cliveo: If the Welsh pair outbid the Irish on this board in the open room, it is difficult to believe Garvey and Carroll will be outbid!|pg||
nt|cliveo: whatever the methods are, the same team has played for some time|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes five years now|pg||
nt|sga1: Now we see 5@c again with a good hand.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but lose 12 much more likely|pg||
mb|2C|nt|mariner1: can NS make 4@S here?|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, but somehoww not too likely|pg||
nt|xenya: the push i meant|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: I dont think west should be encouraging a grand slam with that shape    likely to be at least a vital queen or king missing|pg||
nt|cliveo: I know top players don't like to use blackwood, but anyone who reached a grand on this hand needs to revisit their bidding system|pg||
nt|ady: they wont play lower than 6NT  thats for sure|pg||
nt|cliveo: your B team seemed to perform creditably in the last two Camroses, so it isn't as if you have no other good players|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil_20686: I think it depends largely on partners shape, if he has a 5 card suit grand rates to be fairly good I think, at any rate, with a poor min east is not accepting|pg||
nt|sga1: What these guys r bidding?|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S is not likely either|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: true we have some verfy good players down the line, |pg||
nt|cliveo: Goodness me! Garvey-Carroll outbid on a part score!|pg||
pc|sA|nt|cliveo: I have to say, it seems odd to me when you have such a strong team, that you have trials|pg||
nt|henryb: They play in a different world from that you and I inhabit|pg||
nt|mariner1: I agree on last hand Al, 4@S much safer spot..... NMF or checkback would have|pg||
nt|mariner1: worked|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N - showing the @D stopper :)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|jcomyn: not really clive Hanlon and McGann outbid|pg||
nt|vugraphzgx: Sorry for the connection problem.|pg||
nt|sybarra: nothing you can do :(|pg||
pc|s8|nt|phil_20686: Bakshi agrees with Edwin - that is good enough for me :)|pg||
nt|ahh: its more basic than that Phil if he doesnt have all the bullets  grand is poor |pg||
nt|sharynr: if he knows all the cards like we do, he can do the strip and endplay because of the doubleton diamond K|pg||
nt|ciaran: i guess if the previous hand - KT9xxx xxxx xx x or so was a 2S, this is a 1S :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: anyway Tom is playing it and he is even less green if a little more cabbage-looking - no he is not Annie don't worry|pg||
nt|mariner1: on 19 S opened 3@D and it went SWISH in open :)|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|phil_20686: yes, but he didnt try to investigate with a combined 35-37 count|pg||
nt|ahh: if he has all the bullets theres a hole somewhere else |pg||
nt|vugraphzgj: play did not take long !|pg||
nt|cliveo: an interesting sequence. Let's say Forrester held something like A@s A@h Axxxx@d and AK@c, then 7NT would be a spread|pg||
nt|jcomyn: just joking|pg||
nt|jcomyn: he didnt go down did he?|pg||
nt|ciaran: Maybe bidding 4H is a bit pushy when partner could not act over 1S? |pg||
nt|sharynr: apparently he did|pg||
nt|vugraphzgj: official score sheet reads -1|pg||
nt|ciaran: Seems normal to go one off misguessing hearts|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 9-what Ciaran|pg||
nt|ciaran: :) maybe Tom hasn't read that book|pg||
nt|jcomyn: there we go teaching beginners and Tom ignores us|pg||
nt|cliveo: I think other players should have to demonstrate they have the ability to outperform the current team at this level|pg||
nt|cliveo: Though I know a lot of people disagree with me on selection methods|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well the players at home want trials and after all it means a 96-board practice before the camrose|pg||
nt|sga1: i believe so looking at their bidding.|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h9|nt|woozle: 2H herebeatable, but not on a diamond lead|pg||

nt|xenya: previous hand -- if W had refused to ruff the @CA, the contract would have been beaten?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i agree - shows self sufficient suit|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, i agree Al|pg||
nt|ahollan1: too right Vlad -- force declarer to pitch winner and the she has to ruff next trick|pg||
nt|mariner1: 19 was a double set swing and 5 more imps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: presumably 4@D is cue-bid, just coincidence that he has length -- and south knows off at least @SA|pg||
nt|mariner1: 20 may see us with a new leader though|pg||
nt|xenya: still match is very close|pg||
pc|h7|nt|cliveo: Wrong again . He knows Carrolls opening style though|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well s have to be 2-2 and when does that happen these days|pg||
nt|sybarra: will not be cheap |pg||
nt|santyclz: A lot of cards offside in the save.|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes|pg||
nt|sybarra: too many |pg||
nt|woozle: sorry folks, back after my internet dropped out|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ugly hand to lead from|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jcomyn: 3 to the Q offside and bingo|pg||
nt|cliveo: A lot, yesterday!|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome back, S made the 4 @H's when we all dropped out |pg||
pc|h4|nt|mariner1: yes and @c makes the contract easy......|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|ahh: Phil will not know what a redouble card looks like  for the good of the junior captains blood pressure we take them out of the bidding box |pg||
nt|cliveo: Does everyone agree with Bakhshi's redouble?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: do you want to be in it though?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: I suppose all slams that make are good slams|pg||
nt|cliveo: As the late John Collings said, any slam that makes is a good one|pg||
nt|cliveo: Glad we agree :)|pg||
nt|henryb: be back in a moment. Coffee time|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now 4@H and a disciplined pass by north gets cheers from all|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well done!|pg||
nt|xenya: nicely done|pg||
pc|dK|nt|woozle: South showing poor technique leading the top of a doubleton trump|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d3|pc|d2|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mariner1: well on 20 NS bid all the way to 2@S....... which will score imps but not enough|pg||
nt|xenya: a @D lead might have been awkward for declarer|pg||
nt|mariner1: that in Open|pg||
nt|ahollan1: natsuki - claim early, claim often [before anything goes wrong :) ]|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mariner1: I am assuming they make 2@S though|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ahh: yes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with doubleton trump, i would have tried @D instead of @C -- but leading from Jack is usually bad too|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|s6|nt|woozle: making six now, with two diamonds pitched on clubs|pg||
nt|sybarra: can not make 6 |pg||
nt|sybarra: *now|pg||
pc|s7|pc|h5|nt|cliveo: This sort of hand is why bridge is not a good spectator sport|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|cliveo: Obviously Phil can't answer this question :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @SK to preserve entry to dummy -- another fine play|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|nt|phil_20686: depends on their agreements i would probably just have bid 1@s|pg||
nt|cliveo: We can all see that the contract is very easy to make whereas Garvey does not know the layout of the cards|pg||
pc|h8|pc|d5|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: either odd-even or upside-down attitude -- but @H3 sure looks like "i like @H"|pg||
pc|sT|pc|h6|nt|jcomyn: he does now|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|cliveo: Perhaps Roland should work towards having edited highlights, match of the day style!|pg||
pc|d7|nt|cliveo: how should they find the heart fit then?|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ahollan1: a matchpoint animal would have hooked diamond|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ady: re-double seems normal  especially with singleton@D|pg||
pc|d9|nt|sga1: 11 tricks for NS|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|dT|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|nt|sga1: He shud cash @h A. He can count.|pg||

mb|3C|nt|mdgraham: silly double, then|pg||
nt|Walddk3: but|pg||
nt|jtr: lol|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk3: a heart was led to the ace|pg||
nt|jaapfr: or normally never?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk3: a heart was not returned, but ....|pg||
nt|Walddk3: it did not matter, contract was still 1 down|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|Walddk3: but ...|pg||
nt|athene: if this goes on much longer, sun ming will regret her "careful" play in the 6@H slam last set, which gave up an overtrick and cost an imp|pg||
nt|Walddk3: West lost it in the endgame and 6NT rolled in for 1680 to N-S (Japan)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jtr: last but i think|pg||
pc|sK|nt|Walddk3: instead of 500 to China|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|c2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: (That's enough Buts. Ed.)|pg||
nt|Walddk3: so China lost 16 IMPs instead of gaining 12|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d2|nt|athene: so par bridge all round then :)|pg||

pc|h2|pc|s3|pc|c7|pg||
nt|athene: she won't know that 2nt going down was such a bad board|pg||
nt|petergill: That was Bd 13 in Segment 1. Then on Bd 29 (Bd 13 in Segment 2), a different Chinese West dropped 26 imps in the card play of 6@H, although this time her cardplay seems best but ...|pg||
nt|petergill: unlucky.    |pg||

nt|jcomyn: but much of the entertainment is watching the score hand after hand|pg||
nt|santyclz: The @h guess wasn't too tough.|pg||
nt|sybarra: and 12 imps to n/s on bd 20 |pg||
nt|woozle: Now, 4S maybe making overtricks...a useless board for the trailing team|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good claim :)|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ahh: Bakshi hand from last board has rotated 90 degrees |pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: this is like a rugby match that has a stream of scrums in the middle of the field with nothing happening|pg||
nt|cliveo: this looks like a routine 4@h contract but with the fun and games we've had at this table, who knows|pg||
mb|3C!|an|3!h, INV or better|nt|ahollan1: i wonder if Zia would have played @S10 at trick 1|pg||
nt|mariner1: this is the penultimate board of the match........... score still very close|pg||
mb|3N|nt|cliveo: Although as we can see, 4@s is a good save|pg||
nt|jcomyn: lets all bid each others suits|pg||
nt|cliveo: Carroll has opened another hand that most people would pass|pg||
nt|cliveo: And presumably Garvey has made some sort of game force in @h|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes but saving can be very dangerous when opps dont agree|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3@D would be my call......|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that sure would have slowed down the play|pg||
mb|4H|nt|phil_20686: your hearts don't look good with the hearts on your right, i would rather have AJxx or similar, a true finesse, conversly, your spades have improved, and your hand isnt really good ...|pg||
nt|phil_20686: enough to penalise at the one level - you don;t want to discourage the opposition from competing to 3@H - I would know what to do to that|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't understand East's DBL either|pg||
nt|mariner1: W certainly should think it shows something in a major|pg||
nt|mariner1: this is the penultimate board of this session........ next session in 30 minutes|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahh: all the girls love Tony |pg||
nt|cliveo: A distinguished kibitzer has pointed out that 4@s is not good on a @s lead|pg||
nt|cliveo: Do we know what 3@d means?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgj: no|pg||
nt|mariner1: be sure to check the vugraph schedule, lot of good one there -|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://online.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php - BBO Vugraph Schedule (set|pg||
nt|mariner1: up to show times for your area)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what system/convention has East bid 2@D?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahh: he always has lots of @D|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H  likely spot    will fail to bad trump split|pg||
nt|ady: re-doubled showing 3 hearts|pg||
nt|ahh: xx = 3 @H ?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: usuall extras whoich he dont have|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sick == this will actually work|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seeing dummy makes @H shift easy|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ahh: too quick for me David |pg||
nt|xenya: EW can make 5@C here |pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@D must show @c and @S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: top & bottom?|pg||
nt|xenya: but unlikely to bid it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: top & another??|pg||
pc|d3|nt|jcomyn: I think this may well be bid nowe that Tommy thinks hand is better than it is|pg||
nt|cliveo: I see obviously not a minimum 1@h opener!|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and TG will think his CK is well placed|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mariner1: yes when I saw the DBL did not occur to me it was penalty :)|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|jcomyn: oh well thats it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice @CA - now @D finesse|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|xenya: still a 6-imp swing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i haven't seen either of those treatments in a long time|pg||
pc|s7|nt|cliveo: No, he is well attuned to the Carroll opening style|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or not :)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ady: dont like the spade bid with 3 small  and 4 clubs to the ace|pg||
nt|ady: unusual with my typing|pg||
nt|jcomyn: you have obviously been watching this pair closely|pg||
nt|cliveo: You've been giving me a good inside line on their style!|pg||
nt|mariner1: we have a close match again...... 4 imps|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|ahh: i like this  10 bds in   5 flat boards    best scottish performance for ages |pg||
nt|phil_20686: i don't think norths double here is all that clear, perhaps they are nervoud about getting bullied out of the auction as happened to their team mates against the irish.|pg||
nt|cliveo: reverting to our theme on board 10, it is unlikely Bakhshi will expect N to hold 4@h|pg||
nt|ahh: i think its a clear double by passed hand |pg||
nt|cliveo: I don't disagree|pg||
nt|phil_20686: (and may encourage partner to sac whn its wrong) - would like to see north have more shape and not not Txxx as one of her two suits|pg||
nt|ahh: no sacrificing at  green all   by 2 passed hands |pg||
nt|cliveo: the point is, that with competitive bidding being much more aggressive these days, you don't have to assume that just because someone doubles the suits break badly with the length ...|pg||
nt|cliveo: inthe opposite hand|pg||
nt|phil_20686: you don't sac over game only jim, could easil sac in 2s-1 against 2h-1 with the north hand|pg||
nt|ahh: in Aberden if someone makes a take out double it just about guareentees length in the suit opened|pg||
nt|phil_20686: i think he will now, no one is leading a doubleton diamond on this auction surely|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but this 2 imps to BTU-cheng|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|nt|cliveo: Let's hope the scrums end shortly and we move back to some open play!|pg||
pc|hA|nt|henryb: this has few chances, but remembering the 3@c contract ...|pg||
nt|sga1: Actually it will make.|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4 boards to be score however none look like big swings|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good @S exit|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|d5|nt|ahollan1: closed room coming to the misplayed vul 5@D hand now|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ahollan1: @S10 may/should have suit preference overtones - confirming @H|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|sga1: Now home.|pg||
nt|sga1: Sry No.|pg||
nt|henryb: really? loks like 2@s, 1@h, 1@d and one @c to lose|pg||
nt|sga1: He has to finesse @h now.|pg||
nt|henryb: and only eight winners|pg||
pc|hT|nt|phil_20686: this does not look to be a great switch|pg||
nt|ahh: not the best time for a trump switch sadly |pg||
nt|ady: play ace and another    still no chance|pg||
nt|ady: trump switch ok   |pg||
nt|ahh: even ducking is ok |pg||
nt|ady: yes|pg||
nt|ahh: then can overruff   and play 2 more |pg||
nt|cliveo: although it might not cost giving the contract to Forrester, it seems a really strange switch when partner is known to hold hearts, and if there is a tenace position you are ...|pg||
nt|cliveo: risking giving a trick away|pg||
nt|phil_20686: still a diamond, or a spade return, would lead rather less riskily to -1|pg||
nt|phil_20686: swap the K and A of hearts, and you have just let through the contract by letting him ditch his spade honours on the top clubs|pg||
pc|d6|pc|h7|nt|ahollan1: 2nd chance to take @D finesse rejected -- i guess declarer ok with @H suit being frozen|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|phil_20686: spade losers that is|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes I said earlier they were only in 2@S there|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s8|pc|h9|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ahollan1: trading @S trick for @H trick|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c2|pc|c7|pg||

mb|3N|nt|ahh: no xx they might run |pg||
nt|phil_20686: xx after i have rebid my suit at the 4 level, yes, im confident they will not run :)|pg||
nt|ciaran: McGann likes lead directing third hand openings. |pg||

nt|phil_20686: i wasnt seriously suggesting it :)|pg||
nt|ahh: Sheila |pg||
nt|cliveo: Ann can make an overtrick now if she goes up with K@h and plays the K@s - bit double-dummyish though|pg||
nt|ahh: you see why we remove junior redouble cards now ?|pg||
nt|phil_20686: got to preserve the two for your overtrick|pg||
nt|phil_20686: 2@h that is|pg||

nt|mariner1: ALL the Taipei Operators have been EXCELLENT!|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ady: yes    4H entry|pg||
nt|cliveo: It looks as if Rees should make this for another 5 IMPs to Wales|pg||
nt|cliveo: They are building up a significant lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well - there goes the @H trick|pg||
nt|mariner1: @c lead helps a little here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: except West can't get back to hand|pg||
nt|mariner1: so maybe we will see a swing|pg||
nt|mariner1: S needs to ruff an assumed @D back and underlead @H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no - i think defense still prevails|pg||
nt|mariner1: Many thanks to the NTU Cup folks with Jarron Shih being instrumental, and all the|pg||
nt|mariner1: student organizers for helping BBO bring us the vugraphs......|pg||
nt|xenya: EW  have 12 tricks here but can't quite take them|pg||

nt|mariner1: Vladimir Ivanov (Russia), and Roland Wald (Denmark).....I am Rob Brown|pg||
nt|mariner1: (USA)........|pg||
pc|dK|pg||

nt|mariner1: yes agreed put the Q@H on table|pg||
nt|mariner1: not like you are wasting a trick|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but still @HAK|pg||
nt|mariner1: I mean playing Q@H does not waste a @H trick,,,,,,, so 8 was not well thought out|pg||
pc|d4|nt|jcomyn: this is far from a vintage Irish display I have to say|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now Rob has me thinking -- maybe i could be from another country - i hear good things about New Zealand, except they have winter -- oh well|pg||

nt|mariner1: learning signal takes a lot of play though...........|pg||

mb|3C|mb|p|nt|jtr: They might bid it now too|pg||

nt|cliveo: competition as seriously as the Republic of Ireland?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ciaran: interesting hand - 4S is an ok spot but no good on this layout|pg||
nt|cliveo: As you can see, the Irish pair made 3NT in the other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: daresay he has to bid it|pg||
nt|cliveo: And yet Garvey could have let them play in 2@d|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sharynr: and 4@d will make as well|pg||
nt|jcomyn: lucky|pg||

nt|henryb: to 4 no less|pg||
pc|c9|nt|ahh: no i think so far as Scotland is concerned  we have a very small pool of talent |pg||
nt|jcomyn: and copper time|pg||
nt|cliveo: for the second time in this set, EW with 24 points have virtually been shut out from the auction|pg||
nt|henryb: well done|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|jcomyn: chopper|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ciaran: the lack of entries to south means that the clubs can't be picked up.  (assuming no early ruff for E)|pg||
nt|cliveo: Some welcome points back for the Irish team|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jcomyn: well I wouldnt pass 2D with the W hand|pg||
pc|sK|nt|cliveo: but therefore you would expect much more consistency in the selection process|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|jcomyn: Club switch demanded|pg||
nt|sharynr: having doubled 3@S i dont see why he has to bid at all, when his partner did not cooperate|pg||
nt|ciaran: Hugh looking for an early ruff  - leading suit preference 2|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|cliveo: What it does demonstrate is that if a pair plays a very aggressive style against you, your methods are put to the test|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ahh: and we hold pair trials  which encourages different pairings  getting in the team |pg||
nt|ady: england in 4@H  not doubled board 12|pg||
nt|cliveo: yes, I know some people violently disagree with me, but I think this process is seriously flawed|pg||
nt|henryb: I think 4@s could be beaten if N ducks the first @s|pg||
pc|sA|nt|jcomyn: Tom u mean or is it|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|ciaran: yes - Tom!|pg||
nt|cliveo: I am sure that Rees-Kurbalija will look at some of these hands and work out that they need to revisit their actions against very aggressive opponents|pg||

nt|petergill: I think North should have cashed @HK before giving the ruff - South inferred that North could not have @HA and not cash it. |pg||
pc|d6|nt|petergill: China increase lead from 3 to 4 imps with 4 boards to go. |pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes - she tried to give Norh a diamond ruff|pg||
nt|jtr: North made 2 mistakes in my opinion|pg||
nt|petergill: NS play UDCA|pg||
nt|jtr: Not winning the @cA first was also one|pg||
pc|h6|pc|d7|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s3|pc|s4|pc|sT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: also, the @C7 was led back - not the 2 or 3|pg||
pc|s2|nt|petergill: @C7 was suit pref for hearts, but NS is the pair that has had to play the whole match, I think. |pg||
nt|jtr: chinese found 3 NT on board 61|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|nt|petergill: Playing thoughout 64 board Grand Finals after a long tournament can be exhausting|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so we are all (commentators plus about 820 specs) that both North and South might have defended differently there   |pg||
nt|jtr: This is actually making but somewhat lucky|pg||
nt|petergill: 3NT well done on Bd 61|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h7|nt|petergill: Excellent bidding to 3NT by Liu Yi Qian, so China should retain a small lead with 3 boards to go |pg||

nt|ciaran: Lucky escape for Ireland then - looked like it would be just one off, so the revoke did not cost much|pg||
nt|cliveo: interesting, it might suggest that McGann Hanlon have done a little more work in this area|pg||
nt|cliveo: but Rees and Kurbalija are a fine partnership and I'm sure they will look at their methods closely|pg||
nt|jcomyn: no W bid 2NT and E 3|pg||

nt|cliveo: And Shields bid 4@s which ended the auction|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|cliveo: a kibbitzer has suggested Ireland only has 6 players but their B team performed very creditably int he last two Camrose matches, and if my memory serves me correctly beat our ...|pg||
nt|cliveo: England A team in a critical match last year|pg||
nt|ady: 2nd double|pg||
nt|phil_20686: Its self fulfilling clive, if you send the same 6 players to every tournament, then they will be vastly more expereinced than anyone else|pg||
nt|ady: pass brings in the points|pg||
nt|ahh: the harsh truth is that our top pairs dont work hard enough on their games |pg||
mb|p|nt|cliveo: The way this auction has progressed, one would expect the Welsh pair to bid 4@h and if the Irish pair bid 4@s one would expect them to be doubled|pg||
nt|cliveo: But my predictions have been wrong before, of course|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes but here I think nobody knows who has what at this stage|pg||
nt|cliveo: however, Rees and Kurbalija have a much more conservative style than Garvey and Carroll, so I would expect them to believe they have some defence|pg||
mb|3H!|an|4!s|nt|phil_20686: this is the kind of auction that might demonstrate your point|pg||
nt|phil_20686: all top class players should real 2@s as natural, nearly all club players would try 2NT at this point|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|phil_20686: I rest my case :)|pg||

pc|h3|nt|cliveo: Mind you, the way the bidding has proceeded, Kurbalija may well go off in 4@H. It looks like he needs the @s finesse, and on the bidding he may expect Garvey to hold the K@s!|pg||
nt|cliveo: At least we will know on trick 1 whether he is likely to make or not|pg||
nt|henryb: perhaps. N-S are cold for 4@h|pg||

nt|ciaran: Looks like another one that will be pretty quick|pg||
mb|3N|nt|cliveo: of course you can! who will be your partner?|pg||
nt|phil_20686: paul Gipson|pg||
nt|ady: I am sure forrester will push to the 5 level    5S too high for n/s|pg||
nt|ahh: what we need is our recognised top players to recover from Pauitis  work on their games regroup and come back stronger |pg||
nt|jcomyn: indeed|pg||
nt|henryb: South will propel himself to 3N and deservedly go two down. Lucky actually since one down would be much worse|pg||
mb|p|nt|cliveo: Pauitis?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|cliveo: Well Mcgann Hanlon stayed out of game on a combined 26 count|pg||
nt|henryb: 1@h is an artificial force, 1@s is a further negative|pg||
pc|c5|nt|phil_20686: He is refering to the European chamionships in Pau|pg||
nt|cliveo: I once opened a 7-6 hand 1NT, albeit in 3rd position, in a match against Yorkshire|pg||
pc|cK|nt|jcomyn: as Monty used to say Just the Ten|pg||
pc|c4|nt|phil_20686: Do we all feel that 2@s is correct here?|pg||
nt|henryb: wow, unless that is forcing|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|cliveo: for about 5 years afterwards, whenever I played a Yorkshire pair, I got asked about the shape of my 1NT bids|pg||
nt|henryb: oh. I miscounted. Only a very good 20|pg||
nt|henryb: I had counted 24|pg||
pc|h6|nt|phil_20686: some people might double with xxx, but I like to get my fit on the table|pg||
nt|henryb: so a good stop. +90 is excellent.|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ahh: well yesterday every NT bid seemed to have at least 1 singleton |pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|cliveo: I am told in the other room N responded 1@s|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|nt|cliveo: Results site can be found at: http://www.swanseabridgeclub.org.uk/Camrose2009/rankinglistcopy.htm|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ahh: if you bid 4 card suits up the way 1@S is 95%  5 card |pg||
nt|ahh: 4333 being only exception out with your NT range|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|dburn: if you hold the mouse over open Room on the screen, you do not need to be told|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ahh: any body got any idea of running score ?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|dburn: that is, the cursor rather than the actual mouse|pg||
nt|cliveo: yes, but it is nice to acknowledge friendly and helpful kibitzers!|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this is beginning to look awful bad for Ireland|pg||
nt|dburn: oh, indeed|pg||
nt|vugraphzgj: anyone know the scores in the other matches?|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d9|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hQ|nt|ahh: tables have not been linked since bd 9|pg||
nt|phil_20686: 2@s gains when this comes back to you at a high level of diamonds, your hand is not worth 4 or probably not even 3@s if 3 or 4 @d comes back to you|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h8|pg||
pc|dJ|mc|10|nt|cliveo: yes, it is amazing what some people do with their 1NT openers. I once played a 48-board match against an English international (who shall remain nameless) who opened 1NT against me ...|pg||
nt|cliveo: 6 times and he was never in the point range on the front of his convention card|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C|nt|jtr: Many thanks to our hard working operator, Nobuyuki Hayashi,  Great job!|pg||
nt|jtr: Our appreciation to the sponsor NEC, the JCBL and Akito Omasa for their co-operation in allowing us to present this excellent event.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes indeed|pg||
nt|athene: there's a case for 1@D or 3@D with south|pg||
nt|vugraphzhp: you're welcome:)|pg||
nt|jtr: And finally thanks to my fellow commentators for leading us through these hands|pg||
mb|4D|nt|petergill: Furuta dropped a trick due to nervousness, forgetting that @Da had not gone|pg||
nt|athene: south added the two possibilities together :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: Would you be nervous if you were playing?|pg||
mb|p|pc|cK|pc|c3|pc|c8|pc|c2|pg||
nt|athene: with such a pure hand (no defence) south wants to put a bit of pressure on|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|petergill: I was in our seesaw Nationals Final a few months ago on BBO, where the lead changed for each of the last five hands.  |pg||
pc|c6|nt|jtr: South bids the par contract in one go!|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sA|nt|athene: but often, a very aggressive pre-empt like this can just push opps into a thin making game they weren't otherwise going to bid|pg||

nt|Walddk3: Thx all|pg||
nt|athene: thanks all|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@S -1 would be 4 imps|pg||
nt|mdgraham: bye for now, thanks all|pg||
nt|petergill: if at the other table!|pg||
nt|petergill: or 3@s -1 if @h ruff can be found - we have a thriller on our hands at the other table|pg||
nt|petergill: congratulations to the players on both teams for a fine day's bridge|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Lets rush to the closed room|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Bye for now|pg||
nt|petergill: Congratulations to the China LongZhu National Women's Team on winning a major Open event. Their sponsor LongZhu should be delighted. |pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|phil_20686: Yes thanks to Jim too of course, and BBO for providing this service|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Choose your game here. 3NT, 4@S, 5@D|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this is the biggest defecit I have seen by Ireland in 5 years|pg||
nt|cliveo: This is the last board of the session. Thanks very much to my co-commentator John Comyn, and to Sandie Millichip, our ever-efficient operator. (Hope I've spelt the names ...|pg||
nt|cliveo: correctly!)|pg||
nt|vugraphzgj: it's only 1/2 time|pg||
nt|dburn: 56-21, I believe|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ahh: i got a friendly spec to tell me |pg||
nt|cliveo: yes, congratulations to the operator who has been very accurate throughout|pg||
nt|vugraphzgj: :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: last hand of this segment. Thanks to Sharyn and Ciaran and well done over there with so many problems|pg||
mb|4D|mb|d|mb|p|nt|cliveo: Sandie Millership, sorry|pg||
nt|jcomyn: very interesting morning Clive|pg||
nt|golfsquash: yes, 56-21|pg||
nt|vugraphzgj: it's been spelt worse.  use your imagination!|pg||
nt|cliveo: agreed John, it has been magnificent entertainment, and I have enjoyed your witty and incisive comments|pg||
mb|4S|nt|Walddk4: I am not friendly, and I was the one who told you|pg||
nt|ahh: of course its Sandie not Sandy |pg||
nt|ahh: welcome to Grumpy |pg||
nt|ahh: hi Roland |pg||
nt|ady: 4@H a good spot|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahh: and thanks |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: forester wont be interested with his poor  heart suit and AK clubs|pg||
nt|jcomyn: oh no|pg||
nt|jcomyn: or maybe not|pg||
nt|henryb: looks like making two without breaking a sweat.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|phil_20686: Sandie is teasing us|pg||
nt|jcomyn: clubs 3-3 might help|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but not a lot|pg||
nt|ciaran: Thanks all|pg||
nt|jcomyn: mind both finesses wrong is unlucky|pg||
nt|ciaran: No - does not seem to be a 12th trick available.|pg||
nt|jcomyn: unless some misdefence of some description although cant see it|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ahh: or not :)|pg||
nt|cliveo: A flat board to finish - have a good lunch everyone!|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d9|pg||
nt|henryb: Anyway, I hope all 38 of you enjoyed yourselves. Thanks to the Welsh Bridge Union for arranging this, to the players for subjecting themselves to scrutiny|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ahh: still cuing away |pg||
nt|henryb: To Simon Richards for a tough job well done, and to BBO for making it all possible|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d6|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|ady: I am surpriesed     this is a poor contract|pg||
nt|cliveo: If Forrester takes all the right views, he could make|pg||
nt|vugraphzgj: very late alert|pg||
nt|ahh: no law against bidding poor contracts |pg||
nt|phil_20686: well well, more imps to scotland i expect, i feel west has a sign off over his splinter with AK opposite shortage -  he has bid his hand at that point I feel|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ahh: no law against them making either |pg||
nt|ahh: i am sure ARF will listen and learn Phil |pg||
nt|cliveo: if he makes it, we will probably see an article in the Daily Telegraph. With an anonymous declarer, of course!|pg||
nt|ahh: :)|pg||
nt|ahh: ARF = Antony   R  Forrester |pg||
nt|cliveo: When I lived in Wakefield as a young man, I was very fortunate that the Forrester family often fed and watered me. I saw Tony's mum Jean recently. Indeed, my wife and I played with ...|pg||
nt|cliveo: ehr in a teams competition. Though she is in her early 80s, she still plays a mean game, and indeed we almost won the competition|pg||
nt|ady: he may try to ruff club suit good     this line may fail    can make bringing the spades in  and doing the right thing with hearts|pg||
nt|ahh: this board will take some time |pg||
nt|cliveo: yes, he needs to get the @h suit right. If he does this, his success depends on whether he plays the @h suit or the @c suit|pg||
nt|cliveo: sorry, @s suit or @c suit|pg||
nt|ahh: has to decide what he wants to pitch on @D as well |pg||
nt|phil_20686: well we have heard of Tony's Declarer play, but if he makes this one i will be impressed, surely 3-3 clubs and this heart layout is the best chance?|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|pc|c8|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|pc|sK|pc|s2|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ahh: going to take @S finesse ?|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sJ|pc|sA|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c5|pc|c2|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|phil_20686: he is figing himself the extra chance of Kx@s onside i beleive|pg||
nt|cliveo: isn't playing on @s suit a better percentage?|pg||
nt|phil_20686: giving*|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cT|pc|c4|nt|henryb: North can get squeezed for an extra overtrick now|pg||
nt|henryb: pitch a @c, @hAK and the @dK|pg||
