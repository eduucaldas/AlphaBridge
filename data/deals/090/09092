mb|1N|mb|2C!|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|vugraphzht: hi all!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.slavacup.ru/results/slava.html  for Jan Romanski's excellent scoring programme|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's an advantage if you can read Cyrillic|pg||
nt|xenya: Swiss Butler. 16 rounds of 8-board matches. This is Round 12 -- last one today |pg||
nt|bobh1: hi all|pg||
nt|othered1: rehi, everybody|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hello Ed, Bob, Hans and Vladimir|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|werge: hi|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h6|nt|werge: On a @H-leaf, you must have good signals to defeat this 3 NT|pg||
nt|xenya: Your commentators are Ed Shapiro (USA), Hans Werge (Denmark) and Rob Brown (USA). I am Vladimir Ivanov from Russia|pg||
nt|werge: King and another @h|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h2|pc|h9|pg||
pc|h8|nt|xenya: and also Bob Heitzman (USA)|pg||
nt|werge: Small @H = I have the @c-suit|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|othered1: Finding the shift from AQ would be quite a fine play.  But @H back is provocative|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|c2|pc|c6|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c7|pc|cK|pc|cT|pg||
nt|werge: That´s bridge...!|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|othered1: very well done.  But the @H play does tend to indicate that declarer had 9 tricks|pg||
mc|6|nt|bobh1: shifting to @c's is easy on the rueful rabbit theory--if HH is playing @h's then we shouldn't be|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Still, you need to find it|pg||
nt|othered1: A spec suggests "had declarer attacked clubs himself, hand is over"|pg||
pg||

mb|1C!|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|vugraphzht: 2@c = 10+ hcp, 5+@cs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Many approaches after an inverted riase|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|Walddk2: Some play 2@D now as a balanced minimum, others 2NT, and EW here 3@C it seems|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dT|nt|othered1: must east raise to confirm >2@C?|pg||
nt|vugraphzht: if east have 12-14 weak nt type of course not|pg||
nt|xenya: it's not really an inverted raise -- EW are playing Polish Club, so E can have no clubs at all|pg||
nt|bobh1: some play that inverted raises are forcing to 2n or 3 of your minor|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d7|nt|bobh1: especially at imps this is popular|pg||
nt|xenya: 2@C is just 5+, 10hcp+|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But if East doesn't have at least 2 clubs, he has an 18+ hand|pg||
nt|xenya: yes|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c2|pc|c5|pc|c8|pg||
nt|bobh1: right--E doesn't promise @c's but he rates to have them simply because he didn't start with a different suit|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|pc|cA|pc|cT|pg||
pc|c6|pc|s6|pc|c9|pc|cK|pg||
nt|xenya: any 18+ count is opened 1@C|pg||
nt|bobh1: understood vladimir|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|pc|s3|pc|s7|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Playing natural, I think it's best to have 2@D as the 12-14 bal hand, 2NT as 18-19|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s2|pc|s8|pc|s4|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s5|pc|sA|pc|d6|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|d9|pc|d4|pc|h5|pg||

pc|d5|pc|d8|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|pc|h2|pc|h8|pg||
nt|bobh1: not any more|pg||
nt|vugraphzht: ups sorry all|pg||
nt|vugraphzht: fasy play piekarek have discarded @d|pg||
nt|vugraphzht: fast|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|xenya: why, Roland?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 20-20|pg||
nt|xenya: ah|pg||
nt|werge: I hope, that 2 @D is not everybody´s choice...?|pg||
nt|othered1: 2@D might not be everyone's cup of tea|pg||
nt|bobh1: i don't mind 2@d |pg||
nt|xenya: i do|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Let me ask Everybody|pg||
nt|bobh1: especially opp a passed partner|pg||
nt|werge: Do´nt you prefer to have a @D-suit?|pg||
nt|xenya: very strongly|pg||
nt|bobh1: i prefer better @d's but this is a good hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|bobh1: and the @h length hints that pd will be short there|pg||
nt|bobh1: plus the @h Q is promoted in value|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h9|pc|h6|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|werge: Why not let the poor opponent play - as we have his suit under a certain control|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and the spade shortage hints that partner will be long there|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bobh1: some kibs are agreeing with me, others telling me I'm nuts|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|pc|s9|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Everybody says he has no strong feelings, Hans|pg||
nt|bobh1: while it is true that partner might be long in @s's, the opponents might have a @s fit and 2@d makes it harder for them|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|nt|werge: With A Q 10 x - I go for the money|pg||
pc|h8|pc|c8|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|nt|bobh1: also you'd rather discourage your partner from mentioning his @s's if he has them|pg||

nt|bobh1: what do you mean by "however" Ed?|pg||

nt|othered1: getting away with a overly risky action|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|c7|pc|d7|pg||
pc|sA|pc|dT|nt|othered1: west, who opened the bidding, hasn't shown up with many high cards so far, so declarer's line seems reasonable|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2N!|mb|p|mb|3H!|nt|othered1: I'm surprised south uses the same start to the auction as last hand.  Major difference in support, if that's a focus of the bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S!|nt|bobh1: European-style jacoby|pg||
nt|vugraphzht: 3@h = 14-16 hcp, unspecified singleton|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N!|mb|p|nt|vugraphzht: 3@s = where|pg||
nt|bobh1: 3n=farthest suit|pg||

mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bobh1: S decides--stiff @h is bad for me|pg||

pc|d4|pc|d3|pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|nt|bobh1: a kib pointed out that no singltons in the N hand would be useful so perhaps S should just sign off rather than divulge info unnecessarily|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|nt|werge: Why - his partner could´nt have a penalty double|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and not 8+ hcp with spades|pg||
mb|2N|nt|bobh1: because 6-4 hands often play pretty well and he had both majors|pg||

mb|2C|mb|p|nt|othered1: Lots of HCP and a major misfit.   could be interesting how quickly it can be determined|pg||
nt|bobh1: W tries an inverted "raise" anyway|pg||
nt|xenya: W has a choice between 2@C and 2@D|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|othered1: isn't it better to bid in natural length order?|pg||
nt|xenya: very possibly|pg||
mb|3H|nt|bobh1: 4@h is fine, both majors are copacetic|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Wonder why east in a strong auction would bid out of order.  Canape isn't part of this, is it?|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bobh1: 6@h is not so fine|pg||
nt|xenya: misunderstanding?|pg||

nt|bobh1: I'm sure E put the 6@h card on the table very firmly|pg||
