pc|s2|pc|sT|pc|sK|pg||
nt|xenya: this is not easy to make|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this is a case of damage control for declarer, not to go down a lot|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|pc|hT|nt|fabsayc: north needs to win this trick|pg||
nt|fabsayc: otherwise declarer can switch to diamonds effectively|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 4 rounds of 8 boards remain|pg||
nt|xenya: well it seems declarer simply can't take 7 tricks before the defence get their 7|pg||
nt|fabsayc: they can if he ducks|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d6|pc|d3|pc|d5|pg||
pc|cT|nt|xenya: a tricky hand -- as many 1NT contracts are -- for example, now he goes 2 down|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Wise men say that many auctions are decided at the 2-level|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c3|pc|c2|pg||

nt|Walddk2: You are extremely unlucky to go down in 2@S but you will|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Must play a red card now|pg||
nt|bobholl: @H now will lead to 1 down|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Otherwise declarer will score a low trump and make it|pg||
nt|fabsayc: as usual comes down to who has shortened trumps the fastest|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Because West gets endplayed|pg||
nt|xenya: right|pg||
nt|bobholl: so @D lead was the best after all|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Ilan won't lead a club, only question is which red card|pg||

mb|1D|nt|xenya: declarer would have done better to play a club instead of the @DA, to try sever the defenders' communications |pg||

mb|2N|mb|p|nt|bobholl: with @C Jack lead 3nt won't make :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now 3@S to finish the painting|pg||
nt|fabsayc: declarer can duck if club to jack |pg||
nt|Walddk2: First, South will be on lead, and second, declarer can still make after club to the jack|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|bobholl: for us easier than at table |pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: actually may beat hand with spade switch if club ducked|pg||

nt|mich-b: Very nice @CJ by North|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Indeed, very hard to duck|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h5|nt|mich-b: East would duck that if he could see all cards|pg||
nt|fabsayc: we already analyzed that to death|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||

mb|2S!|nt|mich-b: big hand here ..but looks the bad breaks will be a problem for any possible declarer|pg||
nt|vugraphzht: 2@h = @h + minor|pg||
nt|vugraphzht: 2@s sorry|pg||
mb|d|mb|3H|nt|mich-b: I am not fond of 2@S Michaels with 6 @Hs|pg||
nt|vugraphzht: 5+/5+|pg||
nt|mich-b: I would prefer to overcall 2@H , i think|pg||
nt|fabsayc: especially those particular hearts which are self supporting|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: the alice in wonderland double|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i.e. it means exactly what i say it means|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|hA|nt|mich-b: Well, I am sure South is surprised at the final contract|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and happy too|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|nt|mich-b: think seems to be likely to go down 1|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|mich-b: Hmmm...maybe he should have kept that @H3 in dummy ? ....|pg||
nt|fabsayc: might manage down 2 with a diamond ruff|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hQ|nt|xenya: yes, it might not make, and perhaps it's the best EW could do on this hand|pg||
nt|mich-b: now he will need to guess @Cs, and then play @D to the !J , to escape for down 1|pg||
pc|d3|pc|h8|pg||

nt|vugraphzht: here can be a mistake|pg||
nt|vugraphzht: sorry if so|pg||
nt|mich-b: After West discarded 2@Ds , declarer was safe playing this way|pg||

nt|mich-b: I am wronf, again....|pg||
nt|bobholl: but without a @C lead may make|pg||
nt|mich-b: wrong|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i can not think of a reason to bid 4@H, can anybody|pg||
nt|bobholl: the 3 small @S are nice|pg||
nt|mich-b: yes- I think he convinced himself that pd will have a singleton @S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: partner can bid 4 if he has the singleton|pg||
nt|mich-b: but really, if south had a singleton @S ,it was his duty to bid 4@H|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|s7|pg||
nt|fabsayc: club shift should be clear now|pg||
nt|bobholl: now @C switch may be found|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why the rush? Diamonds are blocked for declarer|pg||
nt|xenya: well their hands do have some material for 4@H, and defenders err occasionally|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I can't see he can make it on a trump switch either|pg||
nt|bobholl: seeing 52 cards gives huge advantage|pg||
nt|xenya: as it happens, almost any return now will beat it|pg||
nt|bobholl: on trump switch and @D continuation it will make 5@H 4@D and a @C|pg||
