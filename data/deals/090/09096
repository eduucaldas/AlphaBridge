nt|fabsayc: i can not see an improvement on starting the spades immediately|pg||
nt|xenya: welcome to Martin Johnson from Canada|pg||

pc|sK|nt|chick: what do you suppose 1@C meant|pg||
nt|xenya: might be a tricky contract though|pg||
nt|hausigel: defense needs to be very careful|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bobholl: tricky to defend too|pg||
nt|mich-b: this lead assures declarer of 2 @S tricks|pg||
pc|s5|nt|hausigel: I would prefer a low spade, for instance|pg||

nt|lestergold: hi Mike fom UK here|pg||
nt|mich-b: this will bring his total to 8 (including the @HQ)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: welcome newcomers|pg||
nt|mich-b: but the defense should have 2@S , 2@C , 1@H|pg||
nt|hausigel: hi mike, hi martin|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d3|pc|d5|pc|dT|pg||
pc|s9|pc|d2|pc|s3|nt|xenya: the defence will likely get 4 more tricks now -- a @S, a @H and 2 @Cs|pg||
nt|fabsayc: of course my screen may fossilize first|pg||
nt|bobholl: east is thinking ahead but it takes much time|pg||
nt|hausigel: maybe he is trying to figure out if declarer can have @HKQ and partner the @CK|pg||
nt|fabsayc: only if he gets cute with club queen lead will defense be in trouble|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|xenya: he seems to have sorted things out|pg||

nt|fabsayc: lol|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|pg||
nt|hausigel: he knows declarer has @DA and @HQ|pg||
pc|c5|nt|fabsayc: apparently the solution is too obvious|pg||
nt|mich-b: well defended by EW , avoiding the traps|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, still well done|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzht: the only pair playing it on this tourney :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: Leo, you misinformed us|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|hausigel: +1, likely|pg||

pc|c2|pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d4|pc|d2|pc|d6|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|lestergold: i think he will simply cash out safely|pg||

pc|d3|pc|c4|pc|dA|pc|dT|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|h7|nt|werge: Risky - with the lead @C 2?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: there was no risk if he ducked first club in dummy|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mich-b: Would anybody find a bid with East?|pg||
nt|mich-b: Double? 2@D?|pg||
nt|hausigel: I vote for 2@D|pg||
nt|xenya: i would settle for 1@S|pg||
nt|othered1: I wouldn't, but it's understandable|pg||
nt|mich-b: I vote for Double|pg||
nt|fabsayc: balancing with west hand is always a nervous thing, but easier versus a limited opener pair|pg||
nt|mich-b: 2@D 2nd choice|pg||
nt|mich-b: would not pass|pg||
nt|bobholl: 1 vote for double from me but not enthousiastic|pg||
nt|xenya: passing is out of the question|pg||
nt|mich-b: well , we wouldnt be making polls when there are enthusiastic choices|pg||
nt|hausigel: West is afraid NS will find a better contract - maybe even game - after balancing|pg||
nt|lestergold: at this vul only i think a disruptive lead directional no trump inhibiting 2d overcall is acceptable|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think pass is well within reasonable|pg||
nt|hausigel: he expects a huge @D fit|pg||
nt|lestergold: but only at green against red|pg||
nt|othered1: Could west be considering how many @S to bid?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: what!|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pc|s2|pc|d6|pg||
nt|mich-b: Well , so whose fault is it?  West? East? percentages?|pg||
nt|xenya: too clever in my opinion|pg||
nt|lestergold: i thought someone would be tto high on these cards not this!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: consistency of style|pg||
pc|h4|nt|othered1: That's taking a very deep position by west and I'd judge 90-10 west for missing @S partial.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: you have to act directly if partner will not protect|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h2|pc|h3|pg||
nt|lestergold: you cannot justify a pass at this vulnerablity with a six card boss suit and a void to boot|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c2|nt|lestergold: highly against the odds|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|h8|nt|hausigel: actually, I think the void is a point for passing|pg||
pc|h5|nt|bobholl: they can't prevent 8/9 tricks|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|d5|pc|s7|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|hausigel: you dont want to see North rebid 3@D next, after balancing in spades|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lestergold: at match points i might be an interesting view but you need sop little from pard to make a lot of tricks that  passing must b wrong at imps|pg||
nt|bobholl: if you play 2@S as weak in 4th position (questionable) i would bid it|pg||
nt|lestergold: not winning bridge to take such a cautious view at the one level- normally llowing opps to play at one level is just giving in and letting them make an easy plus score|pg||
nt|april7: E must play low to save a trick|pg||
nt|fabsayc: why?|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d8|nt|april7: W ruffs and N loses another @C trick|pg||

nt|lestergold: deals like this are not fait to commentators|pg||
mb|3N|nt|lestergold: not fair|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|hausigel: with East as declarer, he would make 11 tricks after heart lead...|pg||
nt|fabsayc: could be right to play hearts before third spade|pg||
pc|c3|nt|xenya: unless they decide to go too high of course|pg||
nt|bobholl: 3 nt c or 3nt +much|pg||
nt|hausigel: but now 9 is the limit|pg||
nt|othered1: south's non-overcall of the @C opening, let north find the contract-holding lead|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cQ|pc|c6|pg||
nt|bobholl: NS will gain (many east open 1nt )|pg||
nt|fabsayc: north needs to hide the club length|pg||

nt|fabsayc: which can be a disadvantage of 4th best leads|pg||

nt|fabsayc: wow, i spilt the coffee pot|pg||
nt|xenya: :)|pg||
nt|chick: and so playing S for 4 spades?|pg||
mc|7|nt|lestergold: sorry i fell on floor cleaning myself up|pg||
nt|chick: S should have made a clearcut signal for even number of spades|pg||
nt|lestergold: no more coffee preduictions in this bridge school|pg||
nt|hausigel: it wouldnt help declarer if South had 4 spades, right?|pg||
nt|othered1: Given that these pairs were first and second at beginning of the set, that could be an event-determining swing|pg||

nt|xenya: and, of course, to all the spectators, who, i hope, enjoyed the show.|pg||
nt|hausigel: interesting bidding problem for North. will he hide the @H fit?|pg||
nt|bobholl: they reversed 1@S and 1NT ?|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: he should not hide heart fit cos spades are ntogood enuf to depend upon for no trumps|pg||

nt|othered1: north looks like a single raise to 2@H to me, but judged to make the invitation call despite the flat hand and bad trumps|pg||
