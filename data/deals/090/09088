nt|xenya: what happened?|pg||
nt|vugraphzht: the board was seen on big screen in playing area :) so it is cancelled :)|pg||
mb|1D|mb|d|nt|april7: contract shouldgo down on careful defence|pg||
nt|vugraphzht: Gromov - Dubinin are playing precision|pg||
mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|mdgraham: that is unfortunate|pg||
mb|2D|nt|vugraphzht: accident|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 2 NT now|pg||
nt|mmmakela: or 3?|pg||
nt|april7: should be able to realize 9 tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: 2N might not convey the strength of his hand?|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: and double is probably not penalty here |pg||
pc|hA|nt|xenya: so he opted for a somewhat crude 4@S...|pg||
nt|mmmakela: that was unexpected |pg||
nt|mdgraham: odd no 1NT overcall|pg||
nt|mmmakela: too good for 1 NT overcall imo|pg||
nt|april7: 15-18|pg||
nt|xenya: which has the advantage of being makeable|pg||
pc|hK|nt|april7: 1NT is a better bid than X|pg||
nt|xenya: thanks to 3-3 @Ss|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|pg||
nt|xenya: at least it looks like it might make|pg||
nt|mmmakela: I like dbl followed with NT, E might not originally have dias suit|pg||
nt|xenya: some work to do no doubt|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c7|pc|c5|nt|april7: if E continues @H S must pull trumps and play @D from hand, E will than be andplayed|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cJ|pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
nt|xenya: solving problems for declarer?|pg||
nt|april7: now its an easy going|pg||
nt|mdgraham: good imaginative switch. East defeats the contract if West holds @S10xx|pg||
nt|xenya: well not quite|pg||
nt|april7: could develop an uppercut, but W doesn't have the 10 of @S|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, great switch, Mike|pg||
nt|mmmakela: if guesses spades after more clubs|pg||
nt|mmmakela: W shd know HA was not singl, if so underleads CA|pg||
nt|mmmakela: K*|pg||
nt|xenya: declarer is facing a guess in @Ss anyway -- even on a neutral return?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: now E can't be short in spades I guess|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cQ|pc|s8|pc|sK|pg||
nt|april7: E opened the bidding, so J in E more likely|pg||
nt|mmmakela: now J under the Q|pg||
nt|mdgraham: good spot - leaves open a finesse of the @S7|pg||

mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|4S|nt|april7: 4@S is a good contract but goes down on @C ruffs|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|april7: not easwy to find this defence|pg||
nt|mdgraham: which, on the bidding, may be found|pg||
nt|april7: actually should lead ace of @C|pg||
nt|mdgraham: although with spades as they are they will find the ruff anyway|pg||
nt|xenya: there is no rush for EW to find the ruff -- they can do it later|pg||
nt|april7: but W doesn't know it|pg||
nt|mdgraham: however West does not know that |pg||
pc|h5|pc|hT|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||

nt|mdgraham: ty, that makes a difference|pg||
nt|mdgraham: however I think East will dind the club return|pg||
nt|vugraphzht: and 3@c promises 4@cs|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c5|pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
nt|mdgraham: now the @C2...|pg||
nt|april7: Lavinthal|pg||

nt|vugraphzht: rudakov - khven have no agreement is 2@h natural or not|pg||
pc|d2|nt|xenya: well i'm saurprised|pg||
nt|mdgraham: hmm- it would seem that with ten spades EW might somehow have bid the suit - bit I don't see how, if you will pardon the feeble attempt at a pun|pg||
nt|vugraphzht: so maybe it's the one of Alexander's reason to pass|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|mdgraham: reckon East has enough to double as a competitive measure? |pg||
nt|xenya: with the W hand you simply must mention @Ss at the 2 level |pg||

nt|vugraphzht: last board in this round, thanks all and we'll be back in 10-15 minutes|pg||
nt|xenya: The last board is coming up, and a few words of gratitude are in order. First, a big thank you to our excellent operator Leonid Bayakchev -- great job! Our appreciations go also to ...|pg||
nt|xenya: Pavel Portnoy, who has been extremely active in organising the tournament throughout its existence, the sponsors and all those who helped bring this event to the BBO audience. ...|pg||
nt|xenya: Thanks to my fellow commentators Mike, Markku, and Avram for donating their time and expertise to guide us through this set|pg||
nt|xenya: And, of course, to all the spectators for their witty and helpful comments.|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|xenya: Hope you enjoyed the show|pg||
nt|vugraphzht: 16+|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p!|nt|vugraphzht: Pass = 5-7 hcp, and some hearts|pg||
mb|3H|nt|xenya: We will be back in 10-15 after this board is over|pg||
mb|4S|nt|xenya: 10-15 minutes, not hours|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: 5@C makes, but how to find out?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this must be South thinking - East surely has no reason to |pg||
nt|xenya: the previous board may turn out disastrous for EW|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Gromov has a problem here. If he believes N-S have 8 hearts between them, Dubinin must have some diamond values for his strong club|pg||
nt|mmmakela: will E make 1 move?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So he may bid again ... only to find that they are too high|pg||
nt|mmmakela: well 4 @S did show min I suppose, but E has 2 prime cards and W shd be void in hearts|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|h7|nt|Walddk2: The point is that Dubinin could have bid 3@S with a good hand, so 4@S suggests that he is minimum for his 16+|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|mmmakela: good judgement|pg||
nt|Walddk2: or even less if he has many spades like here|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s9|pc|s4|pc|h9|pg||
nt|xenya: or W could double, then bid spades -- with a really huge hand|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sT|pc|sK|pc|c4|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d3|nt|april7: 9!|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Somewhat lazy not to insert the 10|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Anyway, just an overtrick. Matters little at IMPs|pg||
mc|11|nt|Walddk2: Thx all, bye for now|pg||
nt|xenya: bye for now|pg||
nt|vugraphzht: thanks all|pg||
