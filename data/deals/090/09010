nt|Walddk2: Just goes to show how strong this field is|pg||
nt|migry: and how much luck u need in this type of event|pg||
nt|jtr: Well over 100+ boards luck should even out to an extent|pg||
nt|jtr: Luck is not only getting errors from your opponents though|pg||
nt|jtr: It is also how well the hands fit your system|pg||
nt|jtr: We saw Meckwell 'unlucky' with a couple of 14-16 NTs yesterday|pg||
nt|migry: maybe it has something to do with the fact that 14-16 is not the best range:)|pg||

pc|cJ|pc|h9|pc|c9|nt|jtr: only 8 tricks otherwise|pg||
nt|dburn: Not sure about that discard - maybe just discouraging in hearts|pg||

pc|cQ|pc|cK|pc|c8|pc|d5|pg||
nt|jtr: At IMPs he would have switched for sure|pg||
nt|fred: Perhaps some NS pairs will discover the diamond flaw and play in 5@C, down 1|pg||
nt|fred: 4@S is also a reasonable contract|pg||
nt|dburn: Now van Cleeff may exit with a club, playing declarer for an original @dKx|pg||
nt|fred: You would think he partner would have been able to say "I like diamonds" by now|pg||
nt|dburn: That would be consistent wih the rest of the defence, and would in truth not be an unreasonable play|pg||
pc|c7|pc|d4|pc|d8|pc|cT|pg||
nt|migry: if declarer wd have had the K@d wd have played clubs before|pg||
nt|dburn: He can tell that if declarer has nothing in diamonds, he is in for an awful result anyway|pg||
nt|migry: wht wd he run for 9 tricks with the K@d?|pg||
nt|fred: True he would have continued clubs if he had a @D stopper|pg||
nt|fanny4: Also, would he have bid 3N with 16 pts, all those controls, and a good @C suit?|pg||
nt|dburn: He almost certainly would not. But at the end of a long and tough event, players sometimes miss such inferences|pg||
nt|jbgood: just what we were saying in the press room Jeff|pg||
nt|fred: he might have bid 3NT with 16HCP especially at matchpoints. Good rule for these guys is to never play your partner for anything when he opens 1@D.|pg||
nt|dburn: We;;, facing a non strong-club opening, even a 16 count might bid 3NT|pg||
nt|fred: I was in Tenerife for most of the tournament and I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the EBL on running a fantastic event.|pg||
nt|fred: The location was perhaps the best I've ever seen, and the organization was sensational.|pg||
nt|jbgood: After Roland made a googly in the hall outside the pressroom and two Italian waiters were hospitalized, we have not been disconnected once in Tenerife! Pardon my Crickish:)|pg||
nt|migry: it's always great when the playing area is inside the hotel where all players r staying|pg||

nt|fred: Meck may well have a chance to make the surprise club lead against 3NT|pg||
mb|d|nt|jbgood: Less than 0.2 points between the leaders now - and the brothers di Bello have retaken the lead! |pg||
mb|3N|nt|dburn: as, I confess, am I - does Brink expect 3NT to make facing a passed partner?|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|fred: The vulnerability and matchpoint scoring make that call more attractive|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ritong: yes, with his hand will often be -50 in a field of 90|pg||
nt|dburn: Indeed - usualy a good idea to play 1NT not vulnerable at matchpoints, since it doesn't matter how many tricks you make|pg||
nt|fred: So NS are in 1NT instead of EW. This may be a "nothing hand" at IMPs, but deals like this one can easily describe matchpoint contests.|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hT|pc|hK|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cJ|pc|cK|nt|fred: If Rodwell had passed, I suspect that Meck would have led a club against 1NT|pg||

pc|sT|pc|s4|pc|sQ|pc|s7|pg||
nt|dburn: but successful matchpoint players try hard to be the first to 1NT when not vulnerable in competitive auctions|pg||
nt|fred: I could see EW coming to 6 tricks in 1NT for -100. If that is a common result, then Meck will have to win 8 tricks for +120 to score well|pg||
