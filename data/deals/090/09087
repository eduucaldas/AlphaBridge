nt|xenya: Hello everyone and welcome to the 7th annual Slava Cup Invitational Pairs held in Moscow.|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|vugraphzht: hi all!|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: Swiss Butler. 16 rounds of 8-board matches. This is Round 7.|pg||
nt|pelu: hi|pg||
nt|vugraphzht: hi all|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hi|pg||
nt|pelu: 3@C - 4.suit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Obviously, 5@D is OK on the lie of the cards, but you would prefer 3NT by East |pg||
nt|vugraphzht: Rudakov is former russia junior team member, young expert|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: I wonder if 3@D is forcing here - yes, it looks like it.|pg||
nt|vugraphzht: and Maxim Petrovich Khven is many times Russia Open team member, very strong player|pg||
nt|pelu: prob 2@D GF|pg||
nt|vugraphzht: yes GF|pg||
nt|xenya: Your commentators are Peter Lund (Denmark), Bill Jacobs (Australia), Roland Wald (Denmark), Hans Werge (Denmark) and Mike Graham (England). I am Vladimir Ivanov from Russia.|pg||
nt|pelu: the A-team :)|pg||
nt|pelu: dif to pas |pg||
nt|bjacobs: So easy for there to be a laydown slam from West's viewpoint.  Eg give partner 3 aces|pg||
nt|xenya: and Ralf Willquist (Sweden) -- sorry Ralph |pg||
mb|4C|nt|bjacobs: So on she goes|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: even 2 aces|pg||
nt|xenya: Our operator is Leonid Bayakchev -- welcome|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Loathsome for East|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 4NT and fold your cards?|pg||
nt|pelu: 4@C ? cue bid?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no now, Bill :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well at least he can glare a bit ... is that allowed?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: a danger here is that East may think 4@C is natural and raise it |pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|ralfwil: agree Bill. 4NT must be a final bid|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ...or make a cue bid....|pg||
nt|pelu: now 4Nt is RKC|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but will convert to 5@d|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|xenya: they will do very well to stop in 5@D|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North is starting to get interested in this auction|pg||
nt|xenya: not sure E is amused|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East thinks, "was 4@C natural?"|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well if 4@C was a cue (I don't think it can be natural, when 3@C was not bid), and so was 4@H, then this is clearly an ace ask|pg||
nt|pelu: for sure not |pg||
nt|vugraphzht: something like this|pg||
nt|mdgraham: agree, with both minors West would bid 3@C followed by 4@c |pg||
mb|5C|nt|mdgraham: (with a strong hand, of course)|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|xenya: excellent!|pg||
nt|pelu: 5@C = 1 or 4 (1430)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a "cat-landing" soft on the feets|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d6|pc|d2|pg||
nt|xenya: just the sort of hand where Polish Club works out very well|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not sure you can beat 3NT as the cards lie|pg||
nt|vugraphzht: 18-20 i think because of 1NT opening = 15-17|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, any strong club, really|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|s6|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and North declined to transfer to 2@H with his soft values  |pg||
pc|hT|pc|h5|nt|bjacobs: So an impressive stop, but due to the strange layout, there doesn't seem to be any stopping 9 tricks|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c5|pg||
nt|bjacobs: If West cashes the heart, the long heart in dummy is trick 9.  If she doesn't cash the heart, she doesn't get it|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h7|pc|s9|pc|c6|pg||
nt|pelu: on a @C lead decl has to play @D before setting up @C-trick|pg||

nt|ralfwil: I mean, he won the contract but not tne score|pg||
mb|1H|nt|pelu: u invest 4IMPs to gain 13 - often 5@D only cost 300-500|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|pelu: 3@S - or 3@D (mini-splint)|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: A big splint, a bit of a stretch imo|pg||

nt|vugraphzht: showing 5+/5+ and max|pg||
pc|c7|nt|Walddk2: This is an interesting hand. He can make it, but he may not|pg||
nt|pelu: but a good contract - but diff to make with this lay-out|pg||
nt|pelu: has to take @CA and play @H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: One way is to win in the dummy and lead a heart up|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|c5|pg||
nt|ralfwil: now S must be careful with entries and play on @h for a @c discard|pg||

pc|hK|pc|h6|pc|h9|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cK|pc|c2|nt|Walddk2: Another way was to win in hand, enter dummy with a trump and lead a heart up. More or less the same thing|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|h4|pc|h3|pc|h7|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s2|pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Then spurn the spade finesse later|pg||

nt|xenya: and, of course, to all the spectators for their witty and helpful comments.|pg||

pc|s6|pc|sK|pc|s3|pc|s4|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The jack works if partner has KQ, but the 8 works if partner has Q9 or K9|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the jack only works if North has underled KQ...|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The rule of 11 tells South that declarer has one higher card ...|pg||
