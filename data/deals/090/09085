nt|april7: 6@H tricks,2 @S tricks 2@C tricks an 1 @D = 11|pg||
nt|xenya: you can set up 5th spade, finesse in clubs, do some cross fuffing -- or get a @D lead?|pg||
nt|xenya: why 2 @C tricks?|pg||
nt|april7: no @D lead possible and if S will not stay low|pg||

pc|s2|pc|sJ|pc|s4|pg||
pc|h7|nt|xenya: this might need some good timing|pg||

pc|d5|pc|d2|pc|s8|pc|d4|pg||
pc|d8|nt|xenya: yes, but he may be looking for a way to make it against 4-2 @Ds|pg||
nt|april7: now change of plan?|pg||
nt|xenya: now, with a spade trick under his belt, he feels much more confident|pg||
nt|april7: he can't try to cash @S J before trumps are drawn, so he will have to rely on @S 3-3 and @H 3-2|pg||
nt|xenya: but still no sure plan|pg||
nt|april7: he might cash only 2 trumps and then try @S|pg||
