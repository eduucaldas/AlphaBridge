nt|Walddk4: We have 6 tables in progress now. Same as we had from the European Championships in Malmo last summer
raija: sorry, Juuri-Oja, i think their son is kibitzing here with us
Walddk4: Our server can't take any more
raija: so that is a real bridge familt!
wiki: is our operator Juuri-Oja also??
Vugraph113: "Pommin varmat " is the other team  which means?
wiki: Bomb sure|pg||
nt|Vugraph113: Pirjo Juuri-Oja has played all competitions in all 35 easter bridge tournaments!
Walddk4: Please welcome Jouni Juuri-Oja, another fine Finnish player
raija: i believe ew play a strong club system
raija: hei hei Jouni :)) 
wiki: yes  Blue club
raija: and if i remember correctly NS are playing Finnish standard
raija: which is 15-17 NT with 2-way stayman and 4 card major openings|pg||
nt|wiki: they have informed  Bart Simpson Club but I am not sure
raija: they didn't use that yesterday
wiki: maybe they have discussed again :))
raija: :)))
raija: and the standard carding in Finland is upside down
raija: so is the count, but very often they use italian signals for the first discard|pg||
nt|raija: operator, wld you pls tell us what are we waiting for
wiki: In Helsinki we had a beautiful spring to-day  sun and + 9
raija: sounds VERY tempting :)
Vugraph113: sure, we are waiting the result from the closed room, only minute I suppose
wiki: yes - you are sitting there in the cold :)
raija: okie, they are playing the board first in the closed room and then we get to see it|pg||
nt|raija: and as we remember from yesterday Valta-Vihtila is the other pair of the team Defenders
raija: Erkki left Pirjo home and took a mirror with him instead
raija: does he often do that, Jouni?
Walddk4: Good afternoon to Richie Reisig from USA
Walddk4: He knows Raija quite well I am told
reisig: hei hei :))
raija: :)))
raija: hei hei boss :))|pg||
nt|Vugraph113: Sorry, seems we have wrong deal here. We'll investigate
wiki: If I remember right Pirjo wants to sit East - at least Easter time
raija: somebody looked at webcamera and said that it shows Pirjo as west
wiki: so wrong again:((
wiki: Hi Richie
reisig: hiya Wiki:))
raija: it only costs one coke to Roland, wiki
wiki: I think they have a deal with Richie - keep me out of that|pg||
nt|reisig: but -you were elected in
raija: Erkkila must be a very creative player to psyche with that hand
wiki: Let us hope that we get the right deal  and suitable to this bidding
Vugraph113: ok, this is board 29 in fact :)
raija: ok, let's start all over|pg||
