nt|swanson: This would usually be an easy 4@S game but we see there is a little problem.|pg||
nt|vugraphzhp: NS big club, EW 2/1.|pg||

nt|bjacobs: The impossible overtake, heart through for 2 tricks, and diamond will beat the contract|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But of course, South has no idea he needs to do that|pg||
nt|swanson: Two rounds of diamonds give the defense a trump tricks.  I don't believe that declarer can avoid two heart losers in addition.|pg||

nt|vugraphzgx: EW are using MOSCITO|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: competition here - who wins?|pg||
nt|cliveo: The Irish team have already built up a large lead; they are on 56 VPs after three matches, 9 VPs ahead of three teams in equal second, England A, England B and Northern Ireland. ...|pg||
nt|cliveo: Wales are not far behind on 43. So if Wales win they are back in the hunt. It's an important morning for them|pg||
nt|henryb: one of those hands that many nowadays open with 1N|pg||
nt|woozle: transfer openings?|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
mb|3C|nt|jcomyn: transfer |pg||
nt|mariner1: this should be interesting then,, MOSCITO is entertaining|pg||
nt|ahollan1: here we go again -- same lineup -- still no Moscito expertise|pg||
nt|mariner1: Hi All and Welcome to the NTU Cup 2009 from Taipei. This is the 1st session of|pg||
nt|mariner1: the finals. The two teams are both from NTU.|pg||
nt|mariner1: Our commentators are Al Hollander and Vladimir Ivanov ........... I am Rob Brown|pg||
nt|mariner1: hi Al and Vlad :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: very close match with 12 boards to go --  but my bet is on BTU|pg||
nt|mariner1: I am backing Al|pg||
nt|xenya: wise|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Vlad - do you see any Moscito players in Russia?|pg||
mb|3H|nt|sharynr: hello "crowd"|pg||
nt|henryb: I understand it but I see no reason not to open 1@c and rebid 1@s|pg||

mb|p|nt|jcomyn: dont think so|pg||
nt|jcomyn: N bids 2H I suspect|pg||
nt|cliveo: The Irish have almost become unbeatable in this competition and it will be a tough task for Rees and Kurbalija, particularly as they had a very hard set against Bakhshi and ...|pg||
nt|cliveo: Forrester last evening|pg||
nt|woozle: 4S NS is playable, and there are 5/6 honours onside making it cold|pg||
nt|xenya: i don't think so|pg||
nt|mariner1: no games here,,,,,,,|pg||
mb|5C|nt|vugraphzgj: sorry - sleeping|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 5-5 in clubs who cares any more?|pg||
nt|cliveo: As you can see, the Irish have an aggressive opening style|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and 4-4 in D by opps|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 5-4|pg||
mb|p|nt|cliveo: Which makes it difficult for them to find their 5-5 club fit|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and us ordinary mortals go 1S-1Nt-2C and bops your uncle|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: a conservative pass by N|pg||
nt|mariner1: hi Al :)|pg||
nt|woozle: of course, NS didn't even think about such a foolish game|pg||
mb|d|nt|henryb: Not so conservative when partner's range is 14-16|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we're at it again, aye Rob|pg||
nt|mariner1: not a lot of action expected on this board.|pg||
nt|woozle: might make 5 if East doesn't return a diamond|pg||
nt|mariner1: take that back, 4@H has play|pg||
nt|mariner1: not that they will be in game ever here|pg||
nt|xenya: cold actually?|pg||
mb|p|nt|cliveo: exactly|pg||
nt|jcomyn: oh well what would we know|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|dK|nt|ahollan1: i don't think i've Moscito from anyone other than Pan Asian players [including Australia & New Zealand]|pg||
pc|d2|nt|cliveo: Although in a 6-1 fit, and the suit breaking 4-2, Garvey can make this contract if he plays on hearts or clubs|pg||
nt|cliveo: So far so good|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d4|pg||

nt|xenya: both pairs playing Moscito here?|pg||
pc|s5|pg||

pc|h2|nt|mariner1: is Oz they are playing transfer and relay MOSCITO these days|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hQ|pc|h6|pg||
nt|henryb: I wonder why people insist on winning the @dK. The @dQ is more deceptive actually|pg||

mb|1N|an|18-20|nt|bjacobs: Probably 4@H is the contract you want to be in here, but that's not easy to diagnose|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|bjacobs: As it turns out, 3NT will make, even with the heart finesse failing|pg||
nt|athene: i am sure they will play 3nt|pg||
nt|swanson: Both 4@H and 3NT are on for N-S here.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: even if north had bid 3@H over 2NT (showing 5 hearts and offering the choice between 4@H and 3NT) south would have gone for the latter|pg||
pc|c2|nt|bjacobs: On board 1, North stole the spade suit in the CR, so E/W reasonably tried their other 8-card fit.  Disaster!|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cJ|pc|cA|pg||
pc|dA|nt|swanson: East chooses a club lead because South has shown four spades (evidently) with his 2@C call.|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|pc|d4|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d9|pc|dK|pc|d7|pg||

nt|athene: three spades, @HK, and and club, with clubs 4-4 all along|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c9|pg||

nt|cliveo: Well done. So though Ireland were in an inferior contract to Wales it has only cost them 1 IMP|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think moscito would have opened East 1N -- so probably back to 2/1 pairs |pg||
nt|mariner1: Vlad we had MOSCITO pair here last session, do not know now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: transfer makes so much more sense to me|pg||

mb|p|nt|phil_20686: Good morning Everyone|pg||
nt|cliveo: This time points evenly divided, looks like a heart spade battle|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hah - I beat Kieran to the follow-up|pg||
nt|woozle: anybody's partscore here -EW in clubs or maybe hearts; NS in diamonds or maybe spades|pg||

nt|henryb: 1@d P 1N 2@s?|pg||
mb|p|nt|cliveo: Good morning everyone|pg||
nt|henryb: no, weak NT and some sort of @c out|pg||
nt|woozle: is 3C weak?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on NZ pair in Beijing played 2-under transfers with other things looking Moscito like|pg||
nt|mariner1: in Oz,,,,,,, my typing is horrible these days|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S makes..... and even 6@S|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Good morning David, Phil and Clive|pg||
nt|ady: good morning|pg||
nt|woozle: that might silence everybody|pg||
nt|mariner1: even 7@S|pg||
nt|mariner1: ruff out 2@D and claim|pg||
nt|ahollan1: I sure hope 2@H is transfer showing contructive @S raise or better|pg||
mb|3C|nt|jcomyn: mm both thought of bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: hi all|pg||
nt|cliveo: However, Kurbalija stopped the spades being introduced|pg||
nt|woozle: or not...3D is an interesting effort|pg||
mb|3N!|nt|woozle: probably about down one|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i must say -- 1@D was flawless|pg||
nt|woozle: 3D might get some partscores right, but it carries big risks, like missing spade games|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but even if it does - this doesn't look like best way to start describing the hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: ok|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Hi Sharyn and John|pg||
nt|sharynr: hey Roland and John :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hi Shariyn|pg||
nt|vugraphzgj: having a few connections problems.  Going to try taking computer back into room now it is connected!!|pg||
nt|sharynr: John, would you have bid over 2D?|pg||
nt|sharynr: with the south hand, that is /|pg||
nt|jcomyn: plenty of hcp but distribution not helpful|pg||
nt|sharynr: I agree|pg||
nt|jcomyn: depends on partner. Not sure|pg||
nt|jcomyn: keep attacking trumps|pg||
nt|sharynr: well the "math" seems to lean toward passing...since the most you can expect is a bad 9 from pard|pg||
nt|sharynr: I wonder if there is still a connection problem|pg||
nt|jcomyn: looks likely|pg||
nt|henryb: this should be 2 down|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes it does seem an unusual call|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil_20686: Al together too early for bridge IMO, alarm felt awfully early this morning :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Forrester - Bakhshi  E-W  for England|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S  the limit|pg||
nt|cliveo: Both teams had a poor start yesterday, England losing 17-13 to their B team and Scotland 25-3 to the Republic of Ireland|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Adamson - Martin   N-S  for Scotland|pg||
nt|mariner1: can they find the nice slam here?|pg||
mb|p|nt|cliveo: Interestingly, both England and Scotland run trials to select their teams, and have not had a good result in the Camrose for some years with this method, whereas the Republic of ...|pg||
nt|cliveo: Ireland have picked the same team year in, year out, and have not been beaten for some years|pg||
nt|vugraphzgj: connection problems :(|pg||
nt|cliveo: You will find that every year, the composition of the English and Scottish teams is totally different from the previous year|pg||
nt|cliveo: Indeed, England won the silver medal at the Beijing Mind Games and yet only one pair from that team is playing this weekend|pg||
nt|jcomyn: club|pg||
nt|woozle: pass would have likely scored +50 - diamond lead, spade switch|pg||
nt|mariner1: so 2@H had to have been @S support|pg||
nt|ahollan1: without knowing all the NS agreements -- this sequence sounds like 3@D=game try|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm just assuming transfer responses over the Takeout DBL|pg||
nt|mariner1: I like the 2@H treatment here....|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i like it for game investigation, but looks cumbersome for slam invite|pg||
nt|ahollan1: North doesn't know if jump was because of @D honors - or shortness|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|cliveo: If Garvey wins and switches to a club this should go one off|pg||
nt|sga1: No looks -1|pg||
pc|s6|nt|cliveo: Adamson-Martin are one of the top lady Scottish pairs, and have done very well to win their place. The Scots, in fact, have three ladies in their team as Liz McGowan is playing ...|pg||
nt|cliveo: with David Liggatt|pg||
pc|s5|nt|phil_20686: It has always been my feeling that straight teams trials will seldom produce the best team|pg||
nt|ady: the hearts in the South hand are not strong enough to win twice  otherwise 4@S could go down|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|d8|nt|sga1: sry u r right|pg||
nt|henryb: 3@c, 2@h and a @d|pg||
nt|sga1: Not any more|pg||
nt|woozle: now maybe club, club, third club for the trump demotion|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what is bug's option?   Neg DBL -- but no rebid after 3@H, PASS hoping for reopening double - then ?3@S?|pg||
nt|woozle: I'd pass, then 4S|pg||
pc|d9|nt|jcomyn: and one off|pg||
nt|henryb: but now may make|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@H must be 1st or 2nd round control - and very discouraging for North - who now knows 4@S was based upon @D shortness rather than honors|pg||
nt|mariner1: does S see slam now?|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d4|pg||
nt|Walddk4: what about a trump lead?|pg||
nt|xenya: i don't see how S could bid slam, aceless|pg||
nt|mariner1:  this board could be a big key in match,,,,, since 6 and 7 also make if bid|pg||
pc|h9|nt|cliveo: I agree with Phil|pg||
nt|Walddk4: That would be very inconvenient for declarer|pg||
nt|ahollan1: welcome to no-man's land  2   [ 1=2N,  2=5Major,  3=3Major,  4=4minor]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Hsiangwen hears an auction that screams for a trump lead and does so -- then looks at the rest of his hand|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mariner1: trump lead as good as any here........ he looks Zugzwang on the opening lead|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ady: Forester m  ust be carefull to p lay 8@H 2nd time if playing from hand|pg||
nt|phil_20686: does not matter, North has no smaller ones left in any event|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but doesnt 4S make|pg||
nt|henryb: will in fact|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now we know double dummy that declarer can take all the tricks -- but at Imps -- first find line to ensure 11 tricks|pg||
nt|mariner1: he heard the @H cue so no @H and @c nor @D looks attractive|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|mariner1: 1st mistake would be assuming you have 4 @c tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or even 2 :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: true|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ady: does not matter as AJ109 now in north hand|pg||
nt|cliveo: Some people might think this defence is routine, but time after time the Irish are so accurate in these situations|pg||
pc|c5|nt|xenya: actually it's not a great slam, looking at NS's hands|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and as here -- how do you feel if 3@C all pass?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: point for the audience -- sometimes preempts make bidding tough|pg||
nt|woozle: 3C all pass is fine - you're facing club length and probably make nothing|pg||
nt|woozle: A crossruff probably falls into 9 tricks here|pg||
nt|woozle: although West's diamond 8 may be a problem on the fourth round of hearts|pg||
mc|11|nt|phil_20686: North should probably have played one of the JT9 as a matter of technique on teh first round of hearts, but a minor slip|pg||
pg||

nt|athene: north just needs two heart stops or one heart stop and @SK/@DA|pg||
nt|bjacobs: He'd trade the KQJ of diamonds for the ace|pg||
nt|athene: with all those quick tricks, 3NT looks appealing for north|pg||
nt|swanson: Maybe neither North or South should have been thinking notrump off this auction.|pg||

nt|Walddk4: I don't think so|pg||
nt|ady: if Martin gets diamond preference   he might back peddle with a jack high suit|pg||
nt|phil_20686: North will offer 6@c as a matter of course, almost irrespective of how the auction develops|pg||
nt|henryb: 5@d is also reasonable|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i like the 3-card @S raise|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Kieran wins the cupie doll -- i hoped someone would mention 1@C with balanced and transfer responses|pg||
nt|woozle: I usually play 2NT after 1x-1y:2y as a 1-round force, after which 3 card raises bid out shape|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N is overbid - punishes partner for opening sub-strength distrbutional hands|pg||
nt|mariner1: my guess is he played out all the trumps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but reopening DBL with that @H holding is .... non-optimal|pg||
mb|3S|nt|jcomyn: yes TG is in England and JC works in Dublin. No they dont play too often outside internationals. In fact John won the Irish Masters playing with Adam Mesbur|pg||
nt|ahollan1: have any of you played the follow-up to determine if opener has made 3 or 4 card raise?|pg||
nt|woozle: my style rebids 1NT (or opens 1C and plays transfer responses) - I like the raise to suggest four so that partner can jump to game more often|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: N-S are women   Sheila - Anne|pg||
mb|4C|nt|mariner1: Q@H is an imaginative lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure anybody follows this anymore, but I learned bidding after reopening DBL to first subtract a King, then bid accordingly|pg||
mb|p|nt|cliveo: I think it unlikely they will bid a slam as with the first set yesterday evening, the cards do lie well for declarer|pg||
nt|phil_20686: (provided only that they get to the 6 level)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hmm -- i hadn't seen the 1 round force treatment before |pg||
nt|ahollan1: duh -- 2N as 1-round force|pg||
nt|mariner1: I like to play 2@C asking over a major, outlawed by ACBL until recently|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that makes West a solid 1N bid|pg||
nt|mariner1: p did bid them so reasonable..... and N has no entry|pg||
mb|4H!|nt|mariner1: sort of like drury in but also in 1st and 2nd seat|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Rob -- you mean like Gazzilli?|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|nt|ady: now South should get the message and if going to the 6 level  clubs rather than diamonds|pg||
nt|cliveo: what do we make of the 3@d bid - agreeing the suit, or a cue-bid? or even something else?|pg||
nt|mariner1: no|pg||
nt|woozle: 4S now has an overtrick on the menu|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil_20686: This hand shows the powed of the mixed cue, the k@c is such a big card in the north hand, Many club players still play cues as ace showing, which is inferior|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's natural where I come from|pg||
nt|phil_20686: she just showed a GF raise in diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|sga1: They r playing 2@s as Baron.|pg||
nt|sga1: I mean 1N - 2@s|pg||
pc|dA|nt|henryb: declarer should actually play a second high heart, then @cA and a @c. |pg||
nt|mariner1: he has time to setup the @c for 2 tricks now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: at this vulnerability - with that @H holding, East knows that West does not have strong hand hoping to defend, so pass and defend well for 100 a trick is much better plan|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d9|nt|phil_20686: could even be 4@d depending on their agreement for inverted minors|pg||
nt|phil_20686: and that pass was unexpected|pg||
nt|cliveo: Well that shows how much we understood of their sequence!|pg||
nt|cliveo: Perhaps the key is that 4@c was not alerted, whereas 2@h, 3@s, 4@h and 4@s all were|pg||
nt|phil_20686: Pass is clearly anti-system, after that many cue bids, but south is worred about her poor diamonds, and opted to get out in a positive|pg||
nt|ady: crouch & Liggins in 6@D   swing for Scotland |pg||
pc|d6|pg||

nt|vugraphzhp: sorry two down.|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C|an|strong|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|swanson: 6NT is frigid here.  THis one N-S will bid easily.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|bjacobs: Right, they have the magic 33|pg||
nt|vugraphzhp: every bid alerted, but no explanation so far.|pg||
nt|athene: if you guess the clubs right you can make 13|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|athene: the simple way is to lead @CK then @CJ, crushing the @C9|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|nt|swanson: 7NT could be made, but the percentage play in clubs (for four tricks) is to finesse the jack.|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: then you can finesse against west's @C8|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But that would not be the right play in isolation would it?|pg||
nt|athene: but even if you just play @CK then club to @C10, there's a double squeeze|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It seems to me that the second club should be a low one to cater for @CQx|pg||
mb|4S|nt|athene: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: if you play @CK then club to @C10, then run winners, neither defender can hold three spades|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|vugraphzhp: South showed 2-3-5-3 shape, 15+|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|mb|6C|nt|bjacobs: I think that double squeeze needs to be combined with a double vienna coup?  Take the AK of hearts in the process|pg||
nt|athene: if east leads a "safe" club against 7NT he will regret it :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzhp: 4@s = RKCB in @D, 5@h = 2 w/@dQ, 6@c = @ck|pg||
nt|athene: north needs to know about the lower honours in the minors (@CQ, @DQJ) for 7 to be good|pg||
nt|vugraphzhp: every North's bid is asking. |pg||
mb|p|mb|6H|mb|p|mb|6N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|swanson: He now needs to ask the opponents who has the @CQ.|pg||
nt|vugraphzhp: 6@s = no outside queens.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Was it Buller who could always sniff out queens?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Someone once planted a hand where he needed to find a queen, but BOTH defenders were given that card|pg||
nt|athene: John Crawford i heard that story about|pg||
nt|bjacobs: After looking at his opponents' body language, he barked: "OK, what joker put the extra queen of clubs into the deck?"|pg||
nt|swanson: Supposed the old-timer P. Hal Sims was great at locating queens.  A hand was once stacked with him declarer, giving both opponents the mssing queen - and he guessed it!|pg||
nt|bjacobs: OK, Sims|pg||
nt|swanson: Doesn't make any difference - I don't believe it anyway.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I am told that Barry Crane used to insist that his partners played for the queen to sit over the jack|pg||
nt|athene: @C9 lead isn't impossible on this bidding - all east knows is that south is 2-3-5-3 with a good hand|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Works here ...|pg||
nt|athene: queen is over the jack in the minors, under the jack in the majors|pg||
nt|vugraphzhp: Now East is asking the meaning of the bid, and wondering about his lead.|pg||
nt|athene: that was Crane's method|pg||
nt|bjacobs: OK.  Sooner or later I will tell an accurate story|pg||
nt|swanson: Crane had a rule (which partner's had to follow) Q over J in majors and the other way around in the minors (ot the opposite - I don't remember).|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I like the way John is telling the stories after me.  Only difference is that he gets them right ...|pg||
pc|d5|nt|athene: i play a relay system similar to this and the biggest advantage you get is not finding impossible slams, but making it hard for opps to defend when they know nothing at all about ...|pg||
nt|athene: declarer's hand|pg||

pc|d4|nt|swanson: Prooijen rejected the percentage play in clubs - and is right.   His other chances will come in.|pg||

nt|henryb: you may be able to avoid the @s finesse|pg||
nt|ahollan1: don't tell me -- @C spots good enough for no loser|pg||
nt|mariner1: in a match this close every trick counts|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i may have convinced myself that North should forcing NT regardless of vul|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: don't be surprised if +150 loses a couple of imps [compared to 1@H going down 2 or 3]|pg||
mb|1C|nt|henryb: can they avoid a really silly game?|pg||
nt|woozle: indeed, after the c8 switch|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: EW can make 4@S with CAREFUL play......|pg||
mb|1S!|nt|ady: part score in diamonds   |pg||
nt|cliveo: to return to the question of selection, and I know how difficult it is because I was chairman of a rugby selection committee for over 5 years, there has been a lack of consistency ...|pg||
nt|cliveo: in the selection of the England teams. For example Bell and Byrne were not selected for the U28 team in Beijing, and yet have been selected for the England B open team, where ...|pg||
nt|cliveo: indeed they showed their ability yesterday with a very good first 16 boards against the A team|pg||
nt|jcomyn: these tactics won buckets of imps against Scotland - or is it bouquets of imps|pg||
nt|cliveo: Again, they have 24 points between them, but this time Rees was able to get into the action before the Irish had a chance!|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: @c good lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wow - red vs white, 2.5+ cover cards -- i think i'd try 4@S|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ady: 3 @D limit|pg||
nt|jcomyn: Spelt Filip I believe sorry about that|pg||
nt|cliveo: Don't worry, there are very few Welsh speakers about|pg||
nt|woozle: 2h rebid is 4 hearts, longer clubs?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Bo -- can you translate?|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil_20686: Do we know what these bids mean?|pg||
mb|4C!|nt|jcomyn: gone crazy again|pg||
nt|sga1: Yes. they may play 3@d.|pg||
nt|mariner1: now S in a spot|pg||
nt|xenya: i certainly would |pg||
nt|mariner1: yes 4 @S looks reasonable to me too......|pg||
nt|ahollan1: declarer much better off if he knows about the @C10 lead - i.e. can it be from interior sequence or not|pg||
nt|ahollan1: IF possibly interior sequence, @C6 would have been good shot -- 2 minutes ago|pg||
mb|p|nt|cliveo: The bidding sequences of our top players are so different to the sequences played at our local clubs that it is very difficult for aspiring players to learn from the experts|pg||
nt|mariner1: @D lead here makes this tough|pg||
mb|4N|nt|woozle: then 3C 2425?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 1@H  re-bid shows spades I think|pg||
nt|henryb: harder if you play 2/1 gf. but then you respond 1N|pg||
nt|sga1: yes.|pg||
mb|6C|nt|cliveo: I agree, otherwise the sequence makes no sense|pg||
nt|phil_20686: I have always found it easy - just ask, top players are normally happy to help, and they all played natural systems once|pg||
nt|jcomyn: will they find it again?|pg||
nt|cliveo: If the Irish keep up their impressive form on defence, this contract will be 1 off after the first four tricks|pg||
nt|jcomyn: Tommy may lead a S however|pg||
nt|cliveo: And as we can see, Ireland got 11 IMPs back on Board 3 through the aggressive tactics of Garvey and Carroll in this room|pg||
nt|vugraphzgj: Carroll tried to lead OOT but Rees stopped him :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: sure he did before CJ hit the table|pg||
nt|vugraphzgj: exactly|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: which Ace is the problem|pg||
nt|jcomyn: looking for a signal|pg||
mb|6N|nt|cliveo: yes, but unless you meet the top players personally to speak to them, that is not available to the ordinary club player|pg||
nt|jcomyn: quick arent they|pg||
nt|sharynr: :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: H3 may ask for a Club - dont know|pg||
nt|mariner1: EW play MOSCITO|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: now some sort of control ask?|pg||
mb|p|nt|cliveo: Reverse attitude?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: perhaps|pg||
nt|jcomyn: now DA and again signal|pg||
nt|jcomyn: process of elimination|pg||
nt|cliveo: According to the convention card, a high card is discouraging|pg||
nt|cliveo: Convention cards for all the pairs playing this weekend can be found at http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2007/camroseteams.htm|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ahhh -- non-transfer moscito|pg||
nt|woozle: West has plenty of controls, maybe 3H showed a min|pg||
nt|ahollan1: of all the red suits -- that @H3 and @HQ were the only ones NOT worth consideration|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 3@D  was a bit pushy on such a tepid suit   |pg||
nt|ahollan1: Kieran - are you a Mosciot convert?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sga1: on a trump lead and continuation, real problem for declarer.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or even Moscito|pg||
nt|woozle: No, but I have played relay before|pg||
nt|woozle: looks fairly vanilla|pg||
nt|ahollan1: are these basically Symmetric Relay based?|pg||
nt|woozle: looks like symmetric|pg||
pc|sT|nt|jcomyn: oh dear he let me down|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|woozle: Not sure about the last two bids by West though - he's loaded with controls, I would have thought he'd be taking up more steps|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|d4|nt|henryb: now a @h towards dummy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: while bidding continues - my favorite relay story -- 1st hand of 2007 Reisinger, kibitzing Burgess-Marston|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they used ALL bids between 1@C and 2N -- BOTH opponents ran out of PASS cards|pg||
pc|d6|nt|Walddk4: Good morning to Jim Hay from Scotland|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ahh: morning everyone |pg||
nt|woozle: My favourite, B-M again, is where they relayed to the five level without skipping a step. At that point, Burgess realised that they were both relaying, figured out what he'd shown ...|pg||
nt|woozle: and what Marston needed to keep bidding for so long, and placed the contract correctly|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|dK|nt|henryb: should have pitched @c|pg||
nt|ahollan1: more than bidding accuracy, relay may gain more just on increasing blind opening lead syndrome|pg||
pc|d9|nt|xenya: claim 11|pg||
pc|d3|nt|cliveo: Good morning, Jim. Has the sun risen in Aberdeen yet?|pg||
nt|ady: good morning|pg||
nt|jcomyn: I see defence was found in open room|pg||

nt|cliveo: their results|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|h3|nt|woozle: It's often inferior when the replier has extra playing strength, or when the described hand is going to be declarer|pg||
pc|s2|nt|cliveo: there are obviously a lot of good people in Scotland then|pg||
nt|ahh: pleased to see our debut girls holding their own against   Englands strike  pair |pg||
nt|cliveo: unfortunately Jim, the 11 IMPs were due to an error by the English at the other table|pg||
nt|ahh: they bid the wrong slam |pg||

pc|hA|pc|h8|nt|cliveo: Yes, Garvey has again been accurate in his defence, and I think the contract is still going off|pg||
nt|woozle: Usual theory is to lead dummy's three card suit...leading dummy's short suits against 3NT is always doomed|pg||

nt|athene: 5@D doesn't look expensive at all for E-W|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2 segments of 16 boards|pg||
mb|4D|nt|athene: i am not sure the low club off dummy second time is necessarily better|pg||
nt|athene: leading the @CJ pins doubleton @C8 or @C9 with east|pg||
nt|athene: leading low club works better with doubleton @CQ with west|pg||
nt|swanson: There is no way West will allow the opponents to play four of a major - don't know why he didn't bid 5@D immediately.|pg||
nt|athene: but you do have to pick the position |pg||
nt|athene: if you play restricted choice you lose to @C98x with east for example|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Looks like N/S need to push on to 5@H if 5@D is bid|pg||
mb|4H|mb|5D|nt|athene: south will surely double 5@D|pg||

mb|5H|nt|athene: wow ok|pg||
mb|p|nt|swanson: Verhees has too many hearts to double 5@D.|pg||
nt|athene: having 4 hearts outweighed the generally defensive honour structure of the hand|pg||
nt|athene: for any kibs who aren't familiar with "inverted doubles"|pg||

nt|athene: (so very common after a strong club and positive)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|dT|nt|athene: basically, over 5@D|pg||

nt|swanson: I ma inforrmed that 2@D may have been a two way bid - either diamonds or not diamonds.  |pg||
nt|swanson: am|pg||
nt|athene: it shows either a hand which just wants to penalty double 5@D, or, if he then pulls it, a strong slam try|pg||

nt|cliveo: Yes, they did|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but he is not passing|pg||
nt|vugraphzgj: John asking about Rees's 2@c - told it is 3 card @s support|pg||
nt|cliveo: Sorry, more up-to-date convention cards can be found at: http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2009/camroseteams.htm|pg||
nt|sga1: NS will buy the contract.|pg||
nt|henryb: fortunately North will rescue him|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right - why risk establishing dummy's suit when dummy has all of those entries|pg||
nt|mariner1: on14 they only bid to 4@S in Open so no big swing,,,,, maybe an imp or 2|pg||
mb|4H|nt|Walddk4: 2@D presumably intermediate|pg||
nt|woozle: although 3NT may appeal to East, and it dies a quick death if fruitman finds a big heart|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharynr: I guess NS play sound overcalls|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: 5@D is pretty good|pg||
nt|cliveo: how would you rate the 3NT by Sime-Matheson on board 4?|pg||
nt|ahh: is that a weak strong jump or a strong weak jump ?|pg||
nt|sharynr: and NS did wel to score plus here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in [more] obnoxious days -- we would have described 2@S as "showing the values for a 2@S bid in this sequence"|pg||
nt|mariner1: he may cash a @H to look I would|pg||
nt|woozle: AKx often a great lead against 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: boy oh boy|pg||
nt|cliveo: Surely Kurbalija hasn't passed here?|pg||
pc|c6|nt|cliveo: yesterday, Townsend-Gold described their jumps as 'strongish', but they had 13 points|pg||
nt|cliveo: At my club even the LOLs would be jumping on the table|pg||
nt|cliveo: OK, that makes more sense|pg||
nt|sga1: Only 2@c makes for NS.|pg||
nt|henryb: and Wast will rescue North|pg||
nt|sga1: He did.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ahh: hopefully better than the 1st board they played yesterday |pg||
nt|sga1: With a ratchet suit, he bids again after doubling.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S looks like automatic response to me -- but if you take away a King, then bypass the suit|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ahh: 3nt -3|pg||
nt|Walddk4: why?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: oh, not this one|pg||
nt|ahh: ok it was  just only -2 |pg||
nt|phil_20686: I think openeing Sime's hand with that suit is poor|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 3NT is an awful contract, but it makes|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You actually need spades 6-3 with no entry to the long suit|pg||
nt|cliveo: does it definitely make on a @s lead?|pg||
nt|phil_20686: or the @d finesse working|pg||
nt|phil_20686: but that is anti-% given the bidding|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Right Clive, North can switch to hearts after 2 rounds of spades|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But will that happen?|pg||
nt|woozle: Big missed opportunity for NS|pg||
nt|xenya: 12 tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: move a small @C from declarer's hand to smal @S -- and 4@S is much better contract than 4@H|pg||
nt|mariner1: I suspect 11 :)|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|cliveo: A kibbitzer has suggested two rounds of @s and a @h switch defeats the contract|pg||
pc|dA|nt|cliveo: Yes, it is easier in double dummy!|pg||
nt|cliveo: If Garvey makes all the right guesses, this is a good vulnerable save against a making non-vulnerable game|pg||
nt|vugraphzgj: sorry thought I had clicked on X but must have been slightly off|pg||
pc|h9|nt|mariner1: so now he makes extras|pg||
nt|ahollan1: here -- the long/strong trump suit it getting tapped|pg||
pc|dT|nt|phil_20686: He would be absolutely correct, but could be letting it through if east has Kxx@Hrather than Kx|pg||
nt|ahh: well for sure this start will not beat it |pg||
nt|mariner1: on 14 4@S only made 4@S so Mixed won an important imp|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but all roads would lead to 4@H so - i'll defer to Vlad and Rob to examine the play|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|woozle: 11 tricks, unless he gets greedy and tries to endplay South|pg||
pc|hA|nt|cliveo: I have to say, I find this quite remarkable. It is well outside my ability range to find this sacrifice|pg||
nt|henryb: He may be forced at the two level after doubling. I would be|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h3|nt|ahh: reasonable with no entries to try and help partner beat it |pg||
nt|phil_20686: i think a @c is what i would have led on this auction|pg||
nt|jcomyn: thats their style clive|pg||
nt|cliveo: Mind you, he still has to get the diamond and heart position correct|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|hK|nt|jcomyn: oops|pg||
nt|cliveo: Now the methods have cost them. But not much, unless he gets the hearts wrong as well|pg||
pc|d9|nt|xenya: not much to examine here|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hJ|pg||
mc|11|nt|cliveo: In fact, we can see that the Irish pair bid to 6@c going one off, so this is going to be a bad board for Ireland whatever happens|pg||

nt|bjacobs: Most modern conventions were invented by Rodwell|pg||

mb|2C|an|FG relay|mb|p|nt|athene: your two hands (penalty interest or slam try) are very different|pg||

nt|jcomyn: when he isnt off playing poker somewhere|pg||
nt|vugraphzgj: Garvey is shaking his head|pg||
nt|woozle: big double-fit hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i have some descriptions of the line -- weird is one with acceptable letter count|pg||
mb|2C!|an|wkD or strong1suit or BAL20+|nt|cliveo: In the open room, Board 5, they are playing in 3@d, so another swing to England|pg||
nt|woozle: NS make 3C or maybe 3S...EW make 11 tricks in either red suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 2@H Micheals now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the downside of Michaels -- North doesn't know - and in fact doubts there is a @C fit|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|jcomyn: excerllent slam here|pg||
nt|henryb: double by N?|pg||
nt|mariner1: EW can make 4@H....|pg||
nt|woozle: I'm not much of a fan of this style of Michaels - I'd have no idea whether to take another bid. 1S leaves you with much better information about your partner's hand|pg||
nt|mariner1: even 5@H|pg||
mb|2S|nt|cliveo: It does show that with modern technology pairs can be very effective even though they live significant travelling distances from each other|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes they do a fair bit of work on the internet - the whole teram doers|pg||
nt|cliveo: We can see the Welsh pair got a good result in the open room|pg||
nt|jcomyn: team does|pg||
nt|woozle: 2S: Anything you can cue I can cue better|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahh: if you always made the best opening lead  you would be worlds number 1 player for sure |pg||
nt|cliveo: Their international results show that hard work pays dividends, too|pg||
nt|jcomyn: not if 6H is bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Italians use Ghestem -- where they would show the 2 specific suits in one bid [but don't ask me which]|pg||
mb|3D|nt|jcomyn: same start in open room|pg||
nt|woozle: Going fancy could cost a bit - 4H would have probably bought it; 3D might let North back in|pg||
mb|d!|nt|cliveo: At the moment, when Bakhshi-Forrester play in a game, Sime-Matheson play in a part score, and vice versa|pg||
nt|cliveo: With any other pair, one would say highly unlikely. But with the way Garvey and Carroll have bid so far this session, who knows?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 5s pushes them to 6H|pg||
nt|cliveo: Rees may live to regret his bid|pg||
nt|henryb: no. we seem to be in the business of rescuing the opponents when they are in trouble|pg||
nt|sga1: He preferred 2@h|pg||
mb|3H|nt|sga1: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: and finish|pg||

nt|cliveo: Although, 6@s is a good save over 6@h :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: unless dbl of course|pg||
mb|4C|nt|ahh: this could have been sneaky 3nt on @S lead |pg||
nt|cliveo: we have a player in the north east called Bill March. If you ever find a lead other than fourth highest of your longest and strongest against 3NT you get many congratulations!|pg||
nt|ahh: but on non @S lead not so hot |pg||
nt|mariner1: I would bid a game as W|pg||
nt|ahollan1: endplayed at trick 1 :(|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: oops again|pg||
nt|cliveo: A lot of IMPs depend on Carroll's next bid|pg||
nt|mariner1: EW have 3N here no problem.. number of tricks only issue|pg||
nt|xenya: i can see 10|pg||
mb|4S|nt|jcomyn: this is not good at all|pg||
nt|cliveo: And unfortunately for Ireland, in the negative column|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: Zugzwang on the lead again :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Paul Marston would say - lead @H instead of @S -- Canape Leads - very interesting article from way back in last millenium|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: how could he know that his diamond honours are working... maybe there's some kind of clue|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: this a lotta imps|pg||
nt|jcomyn: TG will be shaking his head again|pg||
nt|cliveo: A club from Garvey takes the contract two off|pg||
nt|cliveo: Provided Carroll then plays a diamond to the Ace and there is a second club ruff|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|mariner1: only a @c continuation allows 6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: looks as thought West would have bid 2@S over 2@H or 1@S|pg||
nt|woozle: 2H over 1S might work as an asking bid - asking the opponents how many spades your partner has|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c7|pg||
nt|cliveo: Not surprisingly, he played the Ace of diamonds first. Now will he find the club?|pg||

nt|mariner1: thanks Kieran|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well done on both sides|pg||
nt|xenya: provided he had one of course|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|phil_20686: they could do with some cheering up after yesterdays match :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: some hands we have this morning|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nite Kieran|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS have 3N if they get there|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@H bid with Qxx would have been weird|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharynr: will not most likely take @S and @h finesses ?|pg||
nt|cliveo: Denning/Shields will have been disappointed to have missed the slam as they are usually accurate on this type of hand|pg||
nt|henryb: wierd!|pg||
nt|sga1: I was saying for Board 7.|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|ahh: quite happy sniping from the side lines and helping our juniors |pg||
nt|cliveo: After all the excitement of the past boards, this looks like a routine 4@s contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzgj: they've been great hands all weekend|pg||
nt|henryb: I know|pg||
nt|sga1: ok|pg||
nt|xenya: true but might happen|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H!|nt|sga1: 6@s may be bid by East in competition.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S!|nt|mariner1: time for 3N|pg||
nt|mariner1: on 16 3@S here they bid 4 @S in Open...... made 5 here|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharynr: playing for a heart diamond squeeze would do it, yes|pg||
nt|ciaran: probably cashed out and made 12 when @HQ dropped|pg||
nt|sga1: N may have realised and passed 5@s.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: checkback?   blast 4@H |pg||
mb|1N|nt|jcomyn: true although the first half of Ireland v EBU hands were dull enough|pg||
nt|cliveo: Yes, with the exception of one session where there was a succession of part scores, there has been a lot to keep us interested|pg||
nt|vugraphzgj: I'm wearing out my alert button :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hmm or 3@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: South really doesn't want to play @H unless Opener has 4 -- so I prefer checkback if it is available|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|ahh: practical shot from Ann|pg||
nt|ady: 11 tricks in hearts     spade lead will come   so no chance of a slam slipping through|pg||
nt|cliveo: Ann is consistent in her bidding style with long suits|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hope they dont get any rushes of blood to the head here|pg||
nt|cliveo: In the other matches, England are losing to Northern Ireland, whereas the England B team have a comfortable lead over Scotland|pg||
nt|xenya: S might be considering a @D conract -- well both 3N and 5@D make|pg||
nt|mariner1: BTU mixed is about to take the lead|pg||
nt|mariner1: 16 was a 9 imp swing and a new leader, still very close|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what do you think of north's 2@S bid?  i'm trying to decide if 3@H or 3@C had merits [i.e. why introduce bad 4 card suit when partner known not to hold 4@S - else negative DBL]|pg||
nt|mariner1: danger here is S is trying to talk himself out of something.........|pg||
nt|ahollan1: are either of these 'mixed' NS players female?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahh: opps bidding warned her off getting too high |pg||
nt|phil_20686: Slam looks awfully far away if partner cannot find a bid over 2@s, so no real danger in just bidding game|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and i meant blast 4@S|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4 of either major works|pg||
nt|mariner1: do not know|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: I must confess I would not overcall 4@h. I think North's hand is far too strong|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: has to avoid 2 @H losers|pg||
nt|xenya: N's name looks like a female one|pg||
nt|mariner1: a pair of I don't have this suit cue bids :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzgx: S: female N: Male|pg||
pc|c3|nt|jcomyn: I smell 4NT|pg||
nt|cliveo: England have had a very poor record in recent years at the Camrose and now we have the B team leading the A team!|pg||
nt|cliveo: Indeed as the scores stand at the moment, the England B team is hot on the heels of Ireland|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes but you wouldnt call the EBU weak now would you|pg||
pc|c4|nt|xenya: oh |pg||
nt|ahollan1: thanks operator!|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cT|pg||
nt|cliveo: You say that John, but interestingly Bell and byrne, for example, were not considered strong enough to play in the U28 team at Beijing, but were selected for this event|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and has to avoid losing transportation before @S established|pg||
pc|dA|nt|xenya: walking on thin ice now? |pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm intrigued by this hand -- have absolutely no idea about potential nuances|pg||
pc|d9|nt|cliveo: I am not criticising that selection, because Byrne in particular has a very impressive record with a wide variety of partners, but in our Premier League his team did not qualify ...|pg||
nt|cliveo: for the A division|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: definitely best that East is on lead |pg||

mb|p|mb|3N|nt|swanson: Personal opinion is that systems which are totally destructive are detremental to the game.|pg||
mb|p|nt|swanson: There is certainly room for argument in long team matches.|pg||
nt|athene: 6@C is a reaonable contract here|pg||
nt|athene: reasonable|pg||
mb|4C|nt|swanson: I can't seem West bidding on - partner could have too much wasted in diamonds.|pg||
nt|athene: right|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|nt|athene: well east has a monster now|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: @SQxx and @CAQ are as much as he can possibly have in the black suits|pg||
mb|4S|nt|swanson: East should bid a slam now.|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: east was obviously worried they were off @HAK|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Didn't know about the heart control?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: this is where italian control bids are better|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think the whole world should have converted by now to bidding 1st and 2nd round controls|pg||
nt|athene: if west can bid 4@H over 4@D, showing first or second-round control, then east has to bid slam|pg||

nt|ciaran: looks like 1N going -1 on board 7 |pg||
nt|jcomyn: nothing to this|pg||
nt|ciaran: at the other table|pg||
nt|vugraphzgj: still no connection - working in office |pg||
nt|sharynr: will make 4@h here, unless takes a @h finesse into North!. otherwise, a strip and endplay coming.|pg||
nt|sharynr: butopps can foil that by cashing spades |pg||
nt|ciaran: May go wrong if N opens 2S|pg||
nt|jcomyn: Hughe is not as green as he is cabbage-looking I assure you|pg||
nt|cliveo: We were discussing this during another match yesterday, and the conclusion was that the consistency of the Irish selection has a lot to do with its success|pg||
nt|jcomyn: ah part score at last|pg||
nt|vugraphzgj: East aplologising for not bidding six!|pg||
nt|henryb: as well he should|pg||
nt|ahollan1: result says +420, but I still prefer 4@S|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S here also|pg||
nt|xenya: this might be  costly|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: an easy 6NT|pg||
nt|phil_20686: I am a very old 22 year old, i like sherry and scotch in small doses|pg||
mb|1D|nt|sga1: yes.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the very best NS can hope for is a push|pg||
mb|p|nt|cliveo: a teetotal scottish junior? whatever next!|pg||
nt|ady: not much difficulty here|pg||
nt|phil_20686: i think 5N will come out of the box here|pg||
nt|cliveo: yes, it would be a major surprise if they don't play in 6NT|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|jcomyn: not selected Clive - they murdered the winners of our prelim trials in the final trial|pg||
nt|henryb: 6@h cold from N chair|pg||
mb|p|nt|cliveo: If the Welsh pair outbid the Irish on this board in the open room, it is difficult to believe Garvey and Carroll will be outbid!|pg||
nt|cliveo: whatever the methods are, the same team has played for some time|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes five years now|pg||
nt|sga1: Now we see 5@c again with a good hand.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but lose 12 much more likely|pg||
mb|2N|nt|mariner1: can NS make 4@S here?|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, but somehoww not too likely|pg||
nt|xenya: the push i meant|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: I dont think west should be encouraging a grand slam with that shape    likely to be at least a vital queen or king missing|pg||
nt|cliveo: I know top players don't like to use blackwood, but anyone who reached a grand on this hand needs to revisit their bidding system|pg||
nt|ady: they wont play lower than 6NT  thats for sure|pg||
nt|cliveo: your B team seemed to perform creditably in the last two Camroses, so it isn't as if you have no other good players|pg||
mb|3S|nt|phil_20686: I think it depends largely on partners shape, if he has a 5 card suit grand rates to be fairly good I think, at any rate, with a poor min east is not accepting|pg||
nt|sga1: What these guys r bidding?|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S is not likely either|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: true we have some verfy good players down the line, |pg||
nt|cliveo: Goodness me! Garvey-Carroll outbid on a part score!|pg||
mb|3N|nt|cliveo: I have to say, it seems odd to me when you have such a strong team, that you have trials|pg||
nt|henryb: They play in a different world from that you and I inhabit|pg||
nt|mariner1: I agree on last hand Al, 4@S much safer spot..... NMF or checkback would have|pg||
nt|mariner1: worked|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N - showing the @D stopper :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: not really clive Hanlon and McGann outbid|pg||
nt|vugraphzgx: Sorry for the connection problem.|pg||
nt|sybarra: nothing you can do :(|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil_20686: Bakshi agrees with Edwin - that is good enough for me :)|pg||
nt|ahh: its more basic than that Phil if he doesnt have all the bullets  grand is poor |pg||
nt|sharynr: if he knows all the cards like we do, he can do the strip and endplay because of the doubleton diamond K|pg||
nt|ciaran: i guess if the previous hand - KT9xxx xxxx xx x or so was a 2S, this is a 1S :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: anyway Tom is playing it and he is even less green if a little more cabbage-looking - no he is not Annie don't worry|pg||
nt|mariner1: on 19 S opened 3@D and it went SWISH in open :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil_20686: yes, but he didnt try to investigate with a combined 35-37 count|pg||
nt|ahh: if he has all the bullets theres a hole somewhere else |pg||
nt|vugraphzgj: play did not take long !|pg||
nt|cliveo: an interesting sequence. Let's say Forrester held something like A@s A@h Axxxx@d and AK@c, then 7NT would be a spread|pg||
nt|jcomyn: just joking|pg||
nt|jcomyn: he didnt go down did he?|pg||
nt|ciaran: Maybe bidding 4H is a bit pushy when partner could not act over 1S? |pg||
nt|sharynr: apparently he did|pg||
nt|vugraphzgj: official score sheet reads -1|pg||
nt|ciaran: Seems normal to go one off misguessing hearts|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 9-what Ciaran|pg||
nt|ciaran: :) maybe Tom hasn't read that book|pg||
nt|jcomyn: there we go teaching beginners and Tom ignores us|pg||
nt|cliveo: I think other players should have to demonstrate they have the ability to outperform the current team at this level|pg||
nt|cliveo: Though I know a lot of people disagree with me on selection methods|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well the players at home want trials and after all it means a 96-board practice before the camrose|pg||
nt|sga1: i believe so looking at their bidding.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: nasuki gets lucky to find @S tolerance!|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hT|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|santyclz: Just check for waiters with red ties.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i hate to sound that critical - especially since we don't even know if NS have a checkback mechanism, but it is good point for discussion|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c8|nt|woozle: 2H herebeatable, but not on a diamond lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: did he make 4 @H on last hand?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgx: yes|pg||
nt|woozle: good antennae|pg||

nt|sybarra: well done to S and "my" agressive N |pg||
nt|santyclz: Thanks!  We were on tenterhooks.|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C|an|strong|nt|athene: yes, but even with 4nt as blackwood, you are more worried about unbid suits than bid suits|pg||

mb|p|nt|cliveo: Another potential slam hand!|pg||

nt|ahollan1: used winners to pull a round of trump while maintaining control -- good play|pg||
mb|p|nt|cliveo: But they will do well to bid it with only a combined 20 count|pg||
nt|jcomyn: anyone for 1S on S hand - not me|pg||
nt|cliveo: routine for this pair, surely?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes lol|pg||
nt|cliveo: without the intervention Garvey-Carroll have methods to distinguish between voids and singletons; I don't know if the double changes that, but probably not|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: dangerous interference now|pg||
nt|cliveo: 3NT would have shown a void without the double, probably still does|pg||
nt|ahollan1: over 2/1 game force, should 3@H show solid suit and/or extra high cards?|pg||
mb|1S!|nt|phil_20686: grand only needs to be 57% to be a winning proposition, if you are sure your opposition will be in at least small slam, as here|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil_20686: the magic of imps :)|pg||
nt|cliveo: assuming they are playing 20-22 you could throw in j@d and a Q and still have all the other cards I mentioned|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes it does|pg||
nt|cliveo: I think Garvey will be very interested in moving forward now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i believe moscito uses 1@C as 15+ in 1st/2nd seat but 16+ in 3rd/4th -- but i won't swear to that|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS staying out properly here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the point is -- 1@S is limited by failure to open 1@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i know my vote - what say Vlad and Rob?|pg||
nt|mariner1: this|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|sybarra: the Save?|pg||
nt|mariner1: and I don't like 3@H no matter what it shows :)|pg||
nt|xenya: previous hand -- if W had refused to ruff the @CA, the contract would have been beaten?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i agree - shows self sufficient suit|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, i agree Al|pg||
nt|ahollan1: too right Vlad -- force declarer to pitch winner and the she has to ruff next trick|pg||
nt|mariner1: 19 was a double set swing and 5 more imps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: presumably 4@D is cue-bid, just coincidence that he has length -- and south knows off at least @SA|pg||
nt|mariner1: 20 may see us with a new leader though|pg||
nt|xenya: still match is very close|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|cliveo: Wrong again . He knows Carrolls opening style though|pg||

nt|xenya: nicely done|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c9|nt|mariner1: well on 20 NS bid all the way to 2@S....... which will score imps but not enough|pg||
nt|xenya: a @D lead might have been awkward for declarer|pg||
nt|mariner1: that in Open|pg||
nt|ahollan1: natsuki - claim early, claim often [before anything goes wrong :) ]|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|mariner1: I am assuming they make 2@S though|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ahh: yes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with doubleton trump, i would have tried @D instead of @C -- but leading from Jack is usually bad too|pg||

nt|jcomyn: but much of the entertainment is watching the score hand after hand|pg||
nt|santyclz: The @h guess wasn't too tough.|pg||
nt|sybarra: and 12 imps to n/s on bd 20 |pg||
nt|woozle: Now, 4S maybe making overtricks...a useless board for the trailing team|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good claim :)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ahh: Bakshi hand from last board has rotated 90 degrees |pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: this is like a rugby match that has a stream of scrums in the middle of the field with nothing happening|pg||
nt|cliveo: this looks like a routine 4@h contract but with the fun and games we've had at this table, who knows|pg||
mb|2C|nt|ahollan1: i wonder if Zia would have played @S10 at trick 1|pg||
nt|mariner1: this is the penultimate board of the match........... score still very close|pg||
mb|p|nt|cliveo: Although as we can see, 4@s is a good save|pg||
nt|jcomyn: lets all bid each others suits|pg||
nt|cliveo: Carroll has opened another hand that most people would pass|pg||
nt|cliveo: And presumably Garvey has made some sort of game force in @h|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes but saving can be very dangerous when opps dont agree|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3@D would be my call......|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that sure would have slowed down the play|pg||
mb|2D|nt|phil_20686: your hearts don't look good with the hearts on your right, i would rather have AJxx or similar, a true finesse, conversly, your spades have improved, and your hand isnt really good ...|pg||
nt|phil_20686: enough to penalise at the one level - you don;t want to discourage the opposition from competing to 3@H - I would know what to do to that|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't understand East's DBL either|pg||
nt|mariner1: W certainly should think it shows something in a major|pg||
nt|mariner1: this is the penultimate board of this session........ next session in 30 minutes|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahh: all the girls love Tony |pg||
nt|cliveo: A distinguished kibitzer has pointed out that 4@s is not good on a @s lead|pg||
nt|cliveo: Do we know what 3@d means?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgj: no|pg||
nt|mariner1: be sure to check the vugraph schedule, lot of good one there -|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://online.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php - BBO Vugraph Schedule (set|pg||
nt|mariner1: up to show times for your area)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what system/convention has East bid 2@D?|pg||
mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|ahh: he always has lots of @D|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H  likely spot    will fail to bad trump split|pg||
nt|ady: re-doubled showing 3 hearts|pg||
nt|ahh: xx = 3 @H ?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: usuall extras whoich he dont have|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sick == this will actually work|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seeing dummy makes @H shift easy|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahh: too quick for me David |pg||
nt|xenya: EW can make 5@C here |pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@D must show @c and @S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: top & bottom?|pg||
nt|xenya: but unlikely to bid it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: top & another??|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: I think this may well be bid nowe that Tommy thinks hand is better than it is|pg||
nt|cliveo: I see obviously not a minimum 1@h opener!|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and TG will think his CK is well placed|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mariner1: yes when I saw the DBL did not occur to me it was penalty :)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|jcomyn: oh well thats it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice @CA - now @D finesse|pg||
pc|d4|nt|xenya: still a 6-imp swing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i haven't seen either of those treatments in a long time|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|cliveo: No, he is well attuned to the Carroll opening style|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or not :)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ady: dont like the spade bid with 3 small  and 4 clubs to the ace|pg||
nt|ady: unusual with my typing|pg||
nt|jcomyn: you have obviously been watching this pair closely|pg||
nt|cliveo: You've been giving me a good inside line on their style!|pg||
nt|mariner1: we have a close match again...... 4 imps|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ahh: i like this  10 bds in   5 flat boards    best scottish performance for ages |pg||
nt|phil_20686: i don't think norths double here is all that clear, perhaps they are nervoud about getting bullied out of the auction as happened to their team mates against the irish.|pg||
nt|cliveo: reverting to our theme on board 10, it is unlikely Bakhshi will expect N to hold 4@h|pg||
nt|ahh: i think its a clear double by passed hand |pg||
nt|cliveo: I don't disagree|pg||
nt|phil_20686: (and may encourage partner to sac whn its wrong) - would like to see north have more shape and not not Txxx as one of her two suits|pg||
nt|ahh: no sacrificing at  green all   by 2 passed hands |pg||
nt|cliveo: the point is, that with competitive bidding being much more aggressive these days, you don't have to assume that just because someone doubles the suits break badly with the length ...|pg||
nt|cliveo: inthe opposite hand|pg||
nt|phil_20686: you don't sac over game only jim, could easil sac in 2s-1 against 2h-1 with the north hand|pg||
nt|ahh: in Aberden if someone makes a take out double it just about guareentees length in the suit opened|pg||
nt|phil_20686: i think he will now, no one is leading a doubleton diamond on this auction surely|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but this 2 imps to BTU-cheng|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dA|pg||
nt|cliveo: Let's hope the scrums end shortly and we move back to some open play!|pg||
pc|c3|nt|henryb: this has few chances, but remembering the 3@c contract ...|pg||
nt|sga1: Actually it will make.|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4 boards to be score however none look like big swings|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ahollan1: good @S exit|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: closed room coming to the misplayed vul 5@D hand now|pg||
pc|c9|nt|ahollan1: @S10 may/should have suit preference overtones - confirming @H|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sga1: Now home.|pg||
nt|sga1: Sry No.|pg||
nt|henryb: really? loks like 2@s, 1@h, 1@d and one @c to lose|pg||
nt|sga1: He has to finesse @h now.|pg||
nt|henryb: and only eight winners|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|phil_20686: this does not look to be a great switch|pg||
nt|ahh: not the best time for a trump switch sadly |pg||
nt|ady: play ace and another    still no chance|pg||
nt|ady: trump switch ok   |pg||
nt|ahh: even ducking is ok |pg||
nt|ady: yes|pg||
nt|ahh: then can overruff   and play 2 more |pg||
nt|cliveo: although it might not cost giving the contract to Forrester, it seems a really strange switch when partner is known to hold hearts, and if there is a tenace position you are ...|pg||
nt|cliveo: risking giving a trick away|pg||
nt|phil_20686: still a diamond, or a spade return, would lead rather less riskily to -1|pg||
nt|phil_20686: swap the K and A of hearts, and you have just let through the contract by letting him ditch his spade honours on the top clubs|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ahollan1: 2nd chance to take @D finesse rejected -- i guess declarer ok with @H suit being frozen|pg||
pc|s7|pc|c6|nt|phil_20686: spade losers that is|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes I said earlier they were only in 2@S there|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
pc|c5|pc|h2|pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: trading @S trick for @H trick|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|c7|pc|s3|nt|mariner1: right still -100|pg||

mb|1N|mb|d|an|4M + 5m|nt|swanson: North has probably shown a four card major and a longer minor with the double.|pg||

mb|2H|an|spades|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|swanson: The West hand is amazingly poor for four good trumps and 17 HCP - especially with North known to hold hearts.|pg||

pc|c5|pc|s6|pc|s8|pg||
nt|athene: but can still be endplayed even then|pg||
nt|swanson: He needs to rise the the @DA and lead the @CJ - then he is OK.|pg||
pc|d7|nt|athene: declarer can still run the @H9 round to him?|pg||
pc|d8|nt|bjacobs: Yes the endplay was very tricky ... declarer had to not draw trumps to effect the ruff-sluff option later|pg||

nt|jcomyn: not the ideal time for funnies|pg||

nt|athene: when both sides play the same contract, one of them is sure to be breaking Burn's Law|pg||

nt|swanson: West knows that he want to remove as many of dummy's diamonds as possible.  The reason to not lead them however is seen here.  It is better to have partner lead trumps.|pg||
nt|athene: declarer might hope to elope with one more club ruff in hand|pg||

pc|d5|nt|cliveo: What it does demonstrate is that if a pair plays a very aggressive style against you, your methods are put to the test|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ahh: and we hold pair trials  which encourages different pairings  getting in the team |pg||
nt|ady: england in 4@H  not doubled board 12|pg||
nt|cliveo: yes, I know some people violently disagree with me, but I think this process is seriously flawed|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: since his partner is a passed hand|pg||

nt|Walddk2: http://www.jcbl.or.jp/game/nec/necfest.html  for the tournament website|pg||
nt|athene: well he didn't double 1@D|pg||
nt|swanson: THe trouble with passing 2@C is that It is tough to think that you can buy the contract there.  Better to raise clubs I think.|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|3C|nt|bjacobs: 3@C is touchy|pg||
nt|athene: if east had responded a major, then there is the possibility that north's delayed double is full strength but just flawed|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: (i.e. short in east's major)|pg||
nt|brgpro: will beat this|pg||

pc|s6|nt|brgpro: after @dA lead, S will find a @h switch|pg||

pc|s7|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||

nt|phil_20686: Its self fulfilling clive, if you send the same 6 players to every tournament, then they will be vastly more expereinced than anyone else|pg||
nt|ady: pass brings in the points|pg||
nt|ahh: the harsh truth is that our top pairs dont work hard enough on their games |pg||
mb|p|nt|cliveo: The way this auction has progressed, one would expect the Welsh pair to bid 4@h and if the Irish pair bid 4@s one would expect them to be doubled|pg||
nt|cliveo: But my predictions have been wrong before, of course|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes but here I think nobody knows who has what at this stage|pg||
nt|cliveo: however, Rees and Kurbalija have a much more conservative style than Garvey and Carroll, so I would expect them to believe they have some defence|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil_20686: this is the kind of auction that might demonstrate your point|pg||

nt|athene: another strong club for north|pg||
nt|athene: and they should get an uncontested auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Well the last board of the segment has arrived|pg||
nt|swanson: Maybe a strong NT?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Let me find the notes for my speech ...|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|athene: ah right yes|pg||
nt|athene: they play 15-17 don't they|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Many thanks to Nobuyuki Hayashi, NPC of Japan Open, for the excellent operating.  |pg||
nt|vugraphzhp: 15-17|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: diamond lead won't hurt declarer too much|pg||
pc|d6|nt|bjacobs: And also well done to Roland, William, John and Jack for the excellent commentating|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dQ|nt|bjacobs: Finally, thanks to NEC for sponsoring the event, and our appreciation to the JCBL for bringing this prestigious tournament to BBO vugraph. Akito Omasa has been instrumental in ...|pg||
nt|bjacobs: setting up a fine show|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|swanson: Declarer has good chances.  The opponents have no suit to attack.|pg||
nt|athene: thanks everyone...  the next segment is in about half an hour, right?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The second half of the semi-finals starts in just over half an hour|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 40 mins|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|s7|nt|bjacobs: 35 minutes past the hour.  We are in Japan, so the cards will be pulled from the board in 35 minutes past the hour|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Unlike other countries (no, I won't mention them)|pg||
nt|brgpro: the @h 7 and 6 are huge too in this bd|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|athene: for example @h9 - @H10 - @H - @HK|pg||
nt|athene: @H9- @H10 - @HJ - @HK|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hT|nt|brgpro: so is @d9|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sT|pc|sA|pc|s5|pg||
nt|athene: west really misses that @H6 now - the @H5 just isn't cutting it|pg||
nt|swanson: Not to mention the club spots.|pg||
nt|brgpro: yes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In half an hour there will also be a live broadcast from Israel. The final of the Open Teams at the International Festival in Tel Aviv|pg||
pc|sK|nt|brgpro: that's why E cld unblock the J when a @c is played to dummy|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d2|nt|brgpro: i think he is going to make this|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d3|pg||
nt|brgpro: a lot of ways to go home. ( can set up either black suit)|pg||
nt|athene: yes for sure|pg||
pc|s4|nt|athene: might throw the @H7 from dummy just for style points|pg||
pc|d7|nt|swanson: Both East and dummy are getting a bit pinched with these spade leads.|pg||
pc|h4|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|brgpro: i mentioned @h first because W was more likely to switch that suit|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Could dummy get endplayed with @H7?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What happens if West returns a low heart now?|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|athene: SMALL heart now ducked to the @h7|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That @H7 pitch William suggested might be more than just style ...|pg||
nt|athene: the unblock was actually necessary amazingly enough|pg||
nt|athene: i was just babbling, didn't see any of this|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But can the defence possibly work this out?|pg||
nt|brgpro: but W is tempted to play the 8...trying to pin the 7,,,|pg||
nt|athene: it all comes down to who has the @H6|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|nt|bjacobs: Half way there - now Teramoto|pg||
nt|swanson: Can't dummy successfully lead the @CK after winning the @H7 (not that either will happen).|pg||
nt|athene: leading the @CK doesn't work as east can win, cash the @HA and return a club|pg||
nt|swanson: Right.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good column hand this|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h7|pg||
nt|athene: cool!|pg||
nt|bjacobs: A defence to die for|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Remind me to never play against Takayama and Teramoto|pg||
nt|athene: all the bridge teachers here quickly steal this hand for their private debased uses|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But it will appear in the Daily Bulletin first|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Barry Rigal, one of the editors, is in the audience|pg||
nt|bjacobs: He's typing into Word at the moment, I bet|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Right Barry?|pg||
nt|brgpro: now he starts thinking...just needs to do it 2 minutes ago...|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That's harsh ...|pg||
nt|brgpro: a careless mistake|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I have seen worse|pg||

nt|bjacobs: East gets himself off the endplay ... it's all too beautiful for the defence|pg||
nt|brgpro: Ricco van Prooijen is usually a careful player|pg||
nt|athene: great hand to finish the set|pg||
mc|8|nt|Walddk2: But this is poetry in motion|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thanks all|pg||
nt|brgpro: he is also a full time poker player|pg||
nt|brgpro: if he is as careless at the poker table....|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|nt|phil_20686: Yes thanks to Jim too of course, and BBO for providing this service|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Choose your game here. 3NT, 4@S, 5@D|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this is the biggest defecit I have seen by Ireland in 5 years|pg||
nt|cliveo: This is the last board of the session. Thanks very much to my co-commentator John Comyn, and to Sandie Millichip, our ever-efficient operator. (Hope I've spelt the names ...|pg||
nt|cliveo: correctly!)|pg||
nt|vugraphzgj: it's only 1/2 time|pg||
nt|dburn: 56-21, I believe|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahh: i got a friendly spec to tell me |pg||
nt|cliveo: yes, congratulations to the operator who has been very accurate throughout|pg||
nt|vugraphzgj: :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: last hand of this segment. Thanks to Sharyn and Ciaran and well done over there with so many problems|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|cliveo: Sandie Millership, sorry|pg||
nt|jcomyn: very interesting morning Clive|pg||
nt|golfsquash: yes, 56-21|pg||
nt|vugraphzgj: it's been spelt worse.  use your imagination!|pg||
nt|cliveo: agreed John, it has been magnificent entertainment, and I have enjoyed your witty and incisive comments|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: I am not friendly, and I was the one who told you|pg||
nt|ahh: of course its Sandie not Sandy |pg||
nt|ahh: welcome to Grumpy |pg||
nt|ahh: hi Roland |pg||
nt|ady: 4@H a good spot|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|ahh: and thanks |pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|ady: forester wont be interested with his poor  heart suit and AK clubs|pg||
nt|jcomyn: oh no|pg||
nt|jcomyn: or maybe not|pg||
nt|henryb: looks like making two without breaking a sweat.|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil_20686: Sandie is teasing us|pg||
nt|jcomyn: clubs 3-3 might help|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but not a lot|pg||
nt|ciaran: Thanks all|pg||
nt|jcomyn: mind both finesses wrong is unlucky|pg||
nt|ciaran: No - does not seem to be a 12th trick available.|pg||
nt|jcomyn: unless some misdefence of some description although cant see it|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahh: or not :)|pg||
nt|cliveo: A flat board to finish - have a good lunch everyone!|pg||
mb|p|pc|d2|nt|henryb: Anyway, I hope all 38 of you enjoyed yourselves. Thanks to the Welsh Bridge Union for arranging this, to the players for subjecting themselves to scrutiny|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ahh: still cuing away |pg||
nt|henryb: To Simon Richards for a tough job well done, and to BBO for making it all possible|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ady: I am surpriesed     this is a poor contract|pg||
nt|cliveo: If Forrester takes all the right views, he could make|pg||
nt|vugraphzgj: very late alert|pg||
nt|ahh: no law against bidding poor contracts |pg||
nt|phil_20686: well well, more imps to scotland i expect, i feel west has a sign off over his splinter with AK opposite shortage -  he has bid his hand at that point I feel|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ahh: no law against them making either |pg||
nt|ahh: i am sure ARF will listen and learn Phil |pg||
nt|cliveo: if he makes it, we will probably see an article in the Daily Telegraph. With an anonymous declarer, of course!|pg||
nt|ahh: :)|pg||
nt|ahh: ARF = Antony   R  Forrester |pg||
nt|cliveo: When I lived in Wakefield as a young man, I was very fortunate that the Forrester family often fed and watered me. I saw Tony's mum Jean recently. Indeed, my wife and I played with ...|pg||
nt|cliveo: ehr in a teams competition. Though she is in her early 80s, she still plays a mean game, and indeed we almost won the competition|pg||
nt|ady: he may try to ruff club suit good     this line may fail    can make bringing the spades in  and doing the right thing with hearts|pg||
nt|ahh: this board will take some time |pg||
nt|cliveo: yes, he needs to get the @h suit right. If he does this, his success depends on whether he plays the @h suit or the @c suit|pg||
nt|cliveo: sorry, @s suit or @c suit|pg||
nt|ahh: has to decide what he wants to pitch on @D as well |pg||
nt|phil_20686: well we have heard of Tony's Declarer play, but if he makes this one i will be impressed, surely 3-3 clubs and this heart layout is the best chance?|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d3|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|pc|s7|pc|s9|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hT|nt|ahh: going to take @S finesse ?|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sT|pc|sK|pc|s5|pg||
pc|sA|nt|phil_20686: he is figing himself the extra chance of Kx@s onside i beleive|pg||
nt|cliveo: isn't playing on @s suit a better percentage?|pg||
nt|phil_20686: giving*|pg||
pc|d6|pc|c3|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|henryb: North can get squeezed for an extra overtrick now|pg||
nt|henryb: pitch a @c, @hAK and the @dK|pg||
pc|s6|pc|c4|pc|h4|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|pc|hA|pc|h7|pg||
pc|d8|nt|henryb: this works also|pg||
nt|henryb: bye all|pg||
pc|d9|nt|phil_20686: actually|pg||
nt|cliveo: but maybe the combination of playing the two suits is the better play|pg||
nt|phil_20686: i never considered a cross ruff|pg||
pc|h5|pc|c2|pg||
nt|cliveo: if unsuccessful on this occasion|pg||
pc|c5|nt|phil_20686: if the clubs break like this he can often make on a cross ruff|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ahh: this is tough needed to pitch @S |pg||
nt|ahh: pich @C please |pg||
nt|ady: can make now on a cross ruff     cards lay well|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Not really|pg||
nt|cliveo: not if Sheila ditches a @c|pg||
nt|ady: yes   |pg||
nt|ahh: no  north beats by pitching @C |pg||
nt|ady: should have ruffed a diamond|pg||
nt|ahh: yes|pg||
nt|phil_20686: i think this defence is fairly easy to find?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: From our vantage point, sure|pg||
nt|cliveo: not so easy single dummy|pg||
nt|ahh: it always is from here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Try it at the table, Phil|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|ahh: exactly |pg||
pc|cJ|nt|phil_20686: I feel vindicated :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: in front of 300 specs|pg||
nt|cliveo: well done|pg||
mc|8|nt|ady: but surely better to ruff a diamond|pg||
nt|phil_20686: yes i think so|pg||
