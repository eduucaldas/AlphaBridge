nt|Walddk2: JC England 40, (2 matches) Wales 24 (2): Scotland 22 (2), Northern Ireland 20 (1) ROI 14 (1)|pg||

mb|2N!|mb|p!|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|odysseus69: 2d=S=another- 2NT for 3C|pg||
nt|daman: I would   always when I have a 5 card suit |pg||
nt|Walddk2: For commentators who may not know: North and West are ladies, so please remember "she"|pg||
nt|bobh1: this is a good 5-card suit and a v prime hand|pg||
nt|odysseus69: now maybe 3S???|pg||
nt|bobh1: i think S has to pass|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|odysseus69: pass looks right|pg||

mb|1N|nt|mamos: Tom (Dessain) and Dom (Maloney) made a good start in their opening set against Ireland earlier|pg||

nt|ralfwil: majors or Astro?|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|cindy: 2@d could be a lot of things|pg||

mb|p|nt|april7: 3@S by W possible|pg||

mb|p|nt|dburn: maybe he should have bid it, but it's easy to understand why he did not|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mamos: Not many Wests would pass after 1@H|pg||
nt|cindy: a low spade wont be good|pg||
nt|ralfwil: A high @s is needed|pg||
nt|mamos: no I think this will make|pg||
nt|cindy: dont think he will lead high|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sJ|nt|ralfwil: interesting second bid on S. If they are playing a 5-card major opening 2@h shows a 6-card suit or?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 2C would not be universal |pg||
nt|eggy: just one of the "never" (type 3) camp I guess|pg||
nt|mamos: lol|pg||
nt|daman: NS will make 8 tricks at least|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ralfwil: How many of you should bid 1@s on N? |pg||

nt|mamos: declarer off to a comfortable start|pg||
nt|april7: E could have made a DONT bid|pg||
nt|daman: only if that is part of their system :)|pg||
nt|mamos: Englasnd have stopped in 3@C in open Room so a swing straightaway for the home team|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|nt|ralfwil: that´s my opinion too|pg||
nt|eggy: just standard I think|pg||
nt|mamos: 2@C is just an overbid IMHO|pg||
nt|oliverc: on the other hand, north is a passed hand, so limited|pg||
nt|eggy: and then South would bid 2S I suppose|pg||
nt|dburn: and only if he were a certifiable maniac|pg||
pc|cA|pc|d4|pg||

pc|c8|nt|dburn: meanwhile, though, North has done pretty well with his 1NT opening - if they choose 1@h at the other table, East-West may well compete in spades|pg||

pc|s3|nt|Walddk2: A method that uses 2@D to show both majors is unplayable, full stop.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: who thinks this will make?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You need a bid to ask for the longer major and you can't over 2@D|pg||
nt|jtr: You followed "unplayable" with a comma!|pg||
nt|bobh1: on the first board, NS got to 3n in the other room; it was S who promoted his hand, forcing to game after a 1n opening|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes I did, hope you don't report me to Mr. Bird|pg||

nt|marlowepi: once S does not open, N does not like his hand for game, especially with a lot wasted in hearts. maybe he would pass out the double at matchpoints, but even then EW are nonvul, and ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if W has a stiff stpade it could be ugly for NS (esp. if S has spade ace)|pg||

nt|eggy: but after the think, unlikely to save against 6 if West passes|pg||
nt|daman: right|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: over 6s-pass - west should bid grand|pg||
nt|ralfwil: The disadvantage with 5@s is that E can draw the right conclusion |pg||
nt|oliverc: quite|pg||
nt|mamos: and West for that matter |pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree Victor!|pg||
nt|cindy: i think S was about 99% to have four spades|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|eggy: I think that N should still bid and see what they do|pg||

mb|2N|nt|Walddk4: http://bridgewebs.com/cgi-bin/bwg/display.cgi?pid=display_news&club=brunswick  for the tournament website|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: similar auction to board 2|pg||
nt|april7: since it was not a fit, 4th hand didn't balance|pg||
nt|dburn: well, you might bid 2@s over 2@h on the auction as it was, but I agree that it was a position in which neither side might have a great fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|oliverc: East pass here showing the void?|pg||
nt|daman: what was West thinking?|pg||
nt|mamos: EW a little over enthuisiastic here|pg||

nt|daman: is that an undo operator?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: now they must save in 7@s|pg||
nt|odysseus69: has to bid 7S now |pg||
nt|odysseus69: North not South|pg||
nt|eggy: He knows he must save 7 too, but Westmay think N must have a trick to bi 6S|pg||
nt|odysseus69: North has adopted the worst approach possible|pg||
pc|sA|nt|eggy: But North puts the problem back to S :)|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s8|pc|s3|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well, a more optimistic contract this time..|pg||

pc|d4|nt|ralfwil: Here we have a combination of doubles P shows NO  or two defensive trick and S can now see that @cK probably is on side for declarer and must save|pg||
nt|april7: to high this time|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mamos: a double figure swing to England|pg||
pc|dT|nt|Walddk4: For your information commentators and other spectators: three of the players at this table are young ladies. Only East is not. Pls remember (he/she)|pg||
nt|april7: lucky lead though for only 1 down|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: thats a good switch|pg||
pc|hA|nt|dburn: assuming that it was East and not North who bid 4@s, he certainly has his bid. West, on the other hand...|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|pc|h3|pg||
pc|h9|nt|daman: this will be another gain for Wales|pg||
pc|h8|nt|odysseus69: sorry- dont agree - North should simply bid 1 more spade wherever the oppo go|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|april7: might have made a short suit trial, denied by E|pg||
nt|daman: West was  trying to see if there was a star in the East (and I don't mean her partner)|pg||
nt|dburn: ...well, after this start she needs only spades 3-3 and a favourable club position|pg||

pc|d2|nt|daman: yawn|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|oliverc: I must confess I would be tempted to PASS over West's Double here. Bidding some|pg||
nt|oliverc: huge number of Spades immediately on such a weak hand can just make life easy|pg||
nt|oliverc: for Opps. Left to themselves, it's unlikely E/W will bid 7@H here.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If @cK was on N he had to double, showing a supposed trick |pg||
nt|vugraphzjj: cards played wrong - N kept diamonds|pg||
nt|odysseus69: yes - I still like 3S although I have been experimenting with xx|pg||
nt|dburn: put it this way - if I could allow my opponents to play a grand slam on a finesse on every board of a match, I would expect to win that match by a large margin|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|eggy: So what do you do if they do bid 6/7 spades after you pass?|pg||

nt|Walddk4: I would expect more for a 3@H overcall. What about you, guys?|pg||
nt|eggy: I seemed to have arrived at a "sprightly" overcall|pg||
nt|odysseus69: double is penalty so choice is double -only 300- 3NT or 4S- |pg||
nt|oliverc: 4NT?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: would never consider 3H even when I was young|pg||
nt|mamos: East West bid  quite soundly so East will expect a fair hand opposite I think|pg||
nt|odysseus69: sorry- 500 for 3Hx - the preferred option|pg||
nt|mamos: 4@H ?|pg||
nt|oliverc: If West is showing a probable 5-5 with a Minor, East must surely be interested in a|pg||

mb|p|nt|daman: Hastings Pudding|pg||
nt|april7: thats straight forward bidding|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mamos: just a couple of levels too high|pg||
nt|april7: 2down but 4@S is a make|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3D is the value bid, but it takes up a lot of space. for that reason many pairs play a 2C rebid by the opener as artificial|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: club switch by defence needed|pg||

nt|mamos: I think that we must remember the inexperience of the players here but WEst just played too quickly here @H switch could hardly fail unless declarer had nine tricks|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Kelsey has written a very good book: Killing defence|pg||
nt|marlowepi: true. kind of hard for declarer to have nine though, after he ducks clubs twice|pg||

nt|mamos: England supporters will feel this is a poor performance :(|pg||
nt|marlowepi: me too. why let opps in cheaply with 1H? and if they bid more hearts, it may get awkward to show spades. you could miss 4S|pg||
nt|cindy: 1@s is my style|pg||
nt|cindy: but i dont like 2@s by N|pg||

nt|ralfwil: What bid from N will make 1@d a bad bid?|pg||
nt|cindy: spec seems to disagree with my thinking|pg||
nt|mamos: 1@S  is my choice and I know that many disagree but i think it's winning bridge|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it is not N i am worried about. it is W|pg||

nt|marlowepi: if you could guarantee me W would pass i might bid 1D|pg||

nt|cindy: have to get that spade bid in at the 1 level|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: however this may be -2 vs 2 hearts made so no harm done maybe|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but even then it might be critical to play spades from my side to protect hearts king|pg||

nt|mamos: 3@H  didn't go off   oh dear oh dear|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: ah we missed board 10|pg||
nt|april7: cuebid|pg||
nt|april7: almost 6|pg||
nt|eggy: I suppose that NI must be about the most experienced team this year Mike|pg||
nt|daman: should just jump to game now|pg||
nt|daman: signing off|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|april7: then E might continue|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: the trouble with Easts 2 spade bid, its difficult for the west hand to stop|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|eggy: certainly the 3 mowen hace been in the JC for the last 4 years|pg||
nt|marlowepi: NS can do a lot of damage to this, buti cant double|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this auction can;t be right, can it?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Is this right Helen?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Is this right?|pg||
nt|mamos: so 3NT sahowed a @S stop     .......|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: :(   no problem |pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: lots of undos|pg||
mb|p|nt|eggy: women|pg||
nt|mamos: it's very hard to do vugraph operation thanks to our op she's done great|pg||
pc|d8|nt|mamos: NS have no losers but a lot of work to do|pg||
nt|daman: what possible reason would he have to continue after 4@H?   he would pass|pg||
nt|april7: 3@H or 4@H, which is stronger?|pg||
nt|mamos: yes the WElsh team also have played in the JC and PB for some years|pg||
nt|cindy: what is this auction ?|pg||
nt|mamos: nope  wrong operator|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: it may be 3 hearts from west, etc|pg||
nt|hedyg: operator pls undo!|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Helens done really well so far, thanks|pg||
nt|hedyg: AFTER 2@S PASS BY S|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ... but its hard not to bid 2 spades also|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok this is a short version of the bidding|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dT|pc|d3|pg||
nt|daman: 3@H|pg||
nt|daman: leaves room for exploration|pg||
nt|mamos: and ew are to high|pg||
nt|hedyg: after 3@H E bid 3NT and W 4@s|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yep 2 spades went -2 OR|pg||
pc|dA|nt|odysseus69: 6H is enough although cards friendly for grand |pg||
nt|ralfwil: 13 tricks are easy with 2-2 in @h and 3-3 in @c|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d7|nt|april7: so E with 7 controls might invite for slam|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|daman: he would cuebid 3@S over 3 @H   yes|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|eggy: well Cat has, but 3 year ago they were struggling to put a team in at all|pg||
pc|d5|pc|s4|pc|dK|pg||
nt|daman: she :)|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h3|pc|hA|pc|h7|pg||
pc|h4|nt|april7: then 4@C by E and might end up to high though|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hJ|pc|h5|pg||
nt|daman: cannot bid 3@S and 4@C simultaneously Avram|pg||
pc|h2|nt|eggy: do you think 3S guarantees a void?|pg||
pc|h8|pc|s3|nt|eggy: otherwise 4NT would be rather imprecise i think|pg||
nt|april7: after a further Cue by W another cue by E|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|mamos: 6@C would have been interesting but the @d overcall cut the suit out|pg||
nt|marlowepi: surely E did not bid 4S. he barely had a 2S bid|pg||
pc|c8|nt|dburn: should not bid either of them over 3@h - East has judged this pretty well|pg||
nt|daman: West will not cue|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cA|pc|c2|pg||
nt|hedyg: he bid 3NT|pg||
mc|6|nt|mamos: and cindy and Marshall and ralf|pg||
pg||

nt|the saint: Yes indeedy|pg||
nt|bobh1: @s game|pg||
nt|daman: good, close competition|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|the saint: Thanks to Sandie Millership and the NIBU for bringing us this event|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|odysseus69: 1H?|pg||
mb|3S|nt|irwinbo: what was the one heart bid?|pg||
nt|jtr: Lead directing....|pg||
mb|p|nt|the saint: And to your commentators George Holland, Victor Silverstone, Irwin Boris, David Greenwood and Roland Wald|pg||
mb|4H|nt|daman: West has a form of extended Flannery which, as we all know, os a favo(u)rite convention of Roland's|pg||
nt|odysseus69: thx all|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I would be pleased if she had opened 1@S. It doesn't take much to please me|pg||
pc|s4|nt|Walddk2: 4@H is dead|pg||
nt|bobh1: unfortunate choice of majors|pg||
nt|daman: muerto|pg||
nt|bobh1: to play in|pg||
nt|irwinbo: was she going to reverse?|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s3|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|nt|Walddk2: She must have miscounted|pg||
nt|bobh1: W must have had her hand misarranged|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
pc|c6|nt|daman: probably pulled the wrong bid from the box|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cA|pc|c5|pg||
nt|jtr: twice?|pg||
nt|daman: it happens|pg||
pc|s8|nt|Walddk2: She *has* heard about opening the higher of 5-5 I am sure|pg||
pc|sT|pc|h3|pc|s5|pg||
nt|bobh1: then she decided she better play it rather than partner|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cJ|pc|c3|pc|c7|pg||
nt|jtr: I am all for that principle|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Next match in 20 minutes|pg||
nt|bobh1: she didn't want to put that hand down in dummy--too embarassing|pg||
nt|Walddk2: N Ireland vs Scotland. Welcome back then|pg||
mc|9|nt|daman: thanks Roland|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bye for now|pg||
nt|daman: ciao|pg||
nt|irwinbo: thanks all|pg||
nt|bobh1: bye all thx|pg||

nt|oliverc: lol|pg||
nt|odysseus69: cards again friendly for 4S- an unlikely spot|pg||
nt|daman: final board of the set now|pg||
nt|april7: it depends whether 3@D is gameforce or just raise to at least 3@H|pg||
nt|mamos: last board now|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Last hand of this match coming up|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: and a close thing it is too|pg||
nt|marlowepi: ill-advised i would say. he doesnt have a heart stopper really and he has a terrible hand. if W couldnt act over 2H, how can there be game? |pg||
nt|cindy: thx all   think next set in about 20 minutes ?|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|3C!|nt|april7: another 4@S by EW|pg||
nt|mamos: and thanks to NIBU and Sandie Millership for letting us join in and thanks to you all for contributing and to BBO and Roland for organising this  More soon|pg||
nt|ralfwil: thx all. see you again in 20 minutes|pg||
mb|d|nt|mamos: 20 minutes|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mamos: Yes Victor I was thinking EW might get too high but if they do they may make game :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: I don´t like weak nt with a 5-card major|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: sadly NI got it wrong OR|pg||
nt|mamos: West did something she will regret in OR  the pressure is great|pg||
pc|hA|nt|wilkinsona: no way for this to go off it seems..|pg||
pc|h6|nt|odysseus69: happy with 1Nt rather than 1S?|pg||
nt|oliverc: I hve a religious aversion to 1NT here :)|pg||
nt|eggy: I would usually, but I think this a suit oriented hand|pg||
nt|mamos: thanks to the spectators and to your commentators , George Avram David and Steve|pg||
nt|mamos: thanks to the players and Philip our operator  Good job|pg||
nt|april7: thank you all and bye till next time we meet|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mamos: The Spade suit has good texture  prefer 1@S|pg||
nt|ralfwil: perhaps with 5 small in the major|pg||
nt|eggy: Not that I'd be totally happy if East responds 2D|pg||
nt|mamos: thanks to NIBU especially Sandie the match organiser and BGB|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|mamos: i think playing 15-17 it's different - but prefer 5 card Stayman then as well|pg||
nt|mamos: lastly thanks to you all for spending time with us on BBO|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i have to say i could hardly pass 4S once S has doubled 3C. there goes my whole hand on defense|pg||
pc|c6|nt|odysseus69: there are 2 schools of thought - (1) all 5-3-3-2 hands in range should open 1NT and (2) touchy-feely- some yes and some no|pg||
nt|oliverc: what about (3) Never!! ?? LOL|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cA|pc|c5|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hK|pc|h3|pc|h4|pg||
nt|odysseus69: those in the always 1NT school include Andrew Robson and Chris Dixon|pg||
pc|s3|nt|odysseus69: plaaying strong NT the choice is not available|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If W opens with 1@s EW probably had reached 4@s|pg||
nt|mamos: The score is still 0-0 because we have no comparisons yet - I guess that there will be quite a few imps swapping hands in a moment|pg||
nt|odysseus69: I am a touchy-feely but in the interests of partner harmony I have decided to go with 1NT for a while but I am keeping a note now |pg||
pc|s4|pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
nt|marlowepi: could easily be a double game swing, especially if S has a stiff diamond, which is far from unlikely|pg||
mc|11|nt|ralfwil: Bye!|pg||
nt|mamos: bye all :))|pg||
nt|marlowepi: bye all|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: so a last board win for England, thanks to all in Belfast and see you soon |pg||
