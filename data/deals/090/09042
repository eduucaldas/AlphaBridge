Walddk4: Miguel, Kai, Raija, Pekka and Harry
Walddk4: Kari
raija: hi all!
Walddk4: Welcome all
levis24: hi all, welcome
bagman: Hi all
Talion: hi all|pg||
nt|wiki: Hello everybody
wiki: Hello everybody 
Walddk4: We are in Jyväskylä in Finland
Walddk4: The first broadcast ever from the land of the 1,000 lakes
vugraph113: Hi all! Other team still not here. Will take maybe another 10 mins to get started.
raija: In Finland 4 card majors are standard, many play different strong club systems
wiki: actually   200.000 lakes :))|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Even better :-))
Walddk4: But I think it's known as 1,000, at least in Denmark
Walddk4: We call it  De 1,000 søers land
levis24: in Portugal also
wiki: yes   - also rallye of the 1000 lakes happens in JYväskylä
raija: i checked a couple of websites, the other one said 60.ooo and the other 190.ooo
bagman: Never trust anything on the net :)|pg||
nt|vugraph113: There's a web site for info, results and a web cam at http://people.cc.jyu.fi/~kepatana/easter/index.php .
wiki: I added the ponds also
raija: or anything printed either :)
Walddk4: Now let me ask you this: Did anyone count them? :-)
raija: i didn't i stopped 103,404
wiki: Yes they have been counted and I think it is 198000 lakes at least 1 m deep
raija: 1 m = 3 feet|pg||
nt|bagman: Anyhow, back to bridge. Seems that North South are Estonians. Jugandi has played in Estonian national team. EW are yet to show up
raija: hope they didn't miss the train to Jyvaskyla
Walddk4: Can anyone tell us about the hestory of this festival please?
Walddk4: history  even
bagman: No Raija, 1yard is 3 feet :)
raija: :)
vugraph113: We'll wait for the other table to play the board first.|pg||
nt|vugraph113: East West are from Bulgaria
wiki: this is 35. Eastrbridge 
Walddk4: Pekka, you won it before right?
bagman: Yes, also Raija
Walddk4: Raija did too I hear
Walddk4: 4 board matches are like MP
wiki: looks like EW could make 3 NT
Walddk4: Every overtrick counts|pg||
nt|Walddk4: any undertrick too for that matter
bagman: 4 board matches are more like lottery
bagman: in MPs you cannot lose 13 IMP
bagman: One slam swing cannot be compensated by an overtrick in next 2 @C
bagman: Is this IMPs?
wiki: Teams - I think   normal IMPs
vugraph113: Seems we start with board 3.
wiki: You find information from Jyväskylä at www.co.jyu.fi/bridge|pg||
nt|bagman: EW might be in trouble here. Duplication in clubs and bad heart break can mean a big penalty
vugraph113: The webcam sits on my side, so that's North's face you see.
Walddk4: Is it true that in Finland, N can ask for a redeal if he has less than 4 hcp, and W if he doesn't have a 5-5 shape? :-)
raija: of course Roland
raija: you don't do that in Denmark?
bagman: You can ask for a redeal any time you like!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Only on April 1
Walddk4: But that is very soon!!
wiki: here is the word free - you can always ask anything:))
raija: yes, the April Fools' Day is once every year, just like Christmas :)
wiki: I ask everytime I have given 1400 for nothing - they never accept|pg||

nt|Talion: EW dosent play 1NT after 1x pass pass here as 11-14. that is very common agreement in Finland
bagman: I think that the score is 5-0; the boards 2 and 3 being swapped
wiki: Board 3 they bid only 1 NT and made it 
raija: i usually play 11-15 (16) in balancing situation
wiki: so 7-0 should be right

raija: you type faster Pekka
bagman: It is also hard for declarer to know who has clubs. Against me he generally knew because we had diamonds and he had the clubs and his contract|pg||

raija: yes, very well done in closed room, down only 2
Talion: 3NT was better for EW this time. at 4@H they would easily get doubled on this deal
raija: declarer is taking her time to plan the play
bagman: Looks like three down. Generally defense drops a trick, especially the 3rd undoubled undertrick
raija: if i understand correctly a in the end of a name = female in Bulgaria

Talion: yes, but that is general style in estonia to double with 4-2 majors

wiki: I think 18-12 or 19-11|pg||
nt|wiki: we have a small pause  after 4 deals - hope not very long
bagman: Can anybody confirm that in the closed room EW bid 3NT with 21 hcp and 1NT with 24 hcp and 5-3 heart fit?
bagman: My guess is that the real score is 6-1
levis24: the imp scale i got begins with 8 boards, is there one for 4 boards?|pg||

nt|raija: the first slam hand

levis24: will they get to 7?

raija: yes, can pitch the hearts on spades
bagman: Or if one miscounts the club finesse also works

nt|levis24: W will be very hapy after 3@D from E
Talion: 7@D is excellent contract here. lets see if they bid it
bagman: seldom tried in seven, though
raija: blk for diamonds

nt|wiki: waude
raija: oops, he just jumped in there
bagman: Kalma has no way to ask about the spade solidity.
Talion: if Kalma knows that Osta is 5-5 for sure. then he knows that slam is at worst for @C finesse
wiki: they are not afraid - he really was happy with @SK  and right he was
raija: this was not a very scientific way to get there, but a very successful one it was|pg||
pc|d5|nt|raija: we shld see the claim pretty soon
bagman: A good rule for grand bidding: if you play and see 13 tricks or if partner plays and you see 14 tricks
raija: :))
