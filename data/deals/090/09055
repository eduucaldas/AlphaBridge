nt|mariner1: HI all Welcome to the Australian Woman's National Finals............|pg||

nt|mariner1: http://www.bridgeunlimited.com/bridge/DisplayFinal?club_event_id=12797&header=abf&fdc=MZHTHXKXF|pg||
nt|nickf: operator close this room|pg||
nt|nickf: wrong hands|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: Hello Everyone|pg||
nt|mariner1: hi all........... we are 12 minutes from scheduled start...... might be early it seems|pg||
nt|santyclz: We're off to the races.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi folks, welcome to round 3 of the semi-finals.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: good morning all|pg||
mb|1N|nt|mariner1: hi Cornelia|pg||
nt|caitlin: I will say NOTHING about what outcome should be:)|pg||
nt|mich-b: Hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Good morning to Michael Barel|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Hi Karen |pg||
nt|kareno: n/s can make 5 of a red suit and e/w can make 4@s - I expect some competition on this board.|pg||
nt|mich-b: nice hand , especially for me? :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: http://www.summerfestivalofbridge.com/  - Tournament site|pg||
nt|chick: Hiya Rob |pg||
nt|sybarra: hello all |pg||
nt|Walddk5: welcome to Shirley Ybarra|pg||
nt|caitlin: transfer|pg||
nt|sybarra: close to slam here|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@H here, question of how many though|pg||
nt|kareno: And actually e/w can make 5@s if they work out that club suit.|pg||
nt|mich-b: even 4@S is not easy , EW have a loser in each suit|pg||
nt|kareno: I don't particularly like bidding 2@c with a two-suited hand.|pg||
nt|mich-b: unless he can guess the @C brilliantly|pg||
nt|mrdct: looks like we have the HUM system NS|pg||
nt|jrssd: good evening all|pg||
nt|mrdct: pass will be 0-6 or a few strong hand types|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Welcome all :)|pg||
nt|april7: we begin with a Slam|pg||
nt|mdgraham: we start with a pretty laydown club slam, which might not be so easy to bid after the 1NT opening|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|mariner1: http://www.bridgeunlimited.com/bridge/ViewMasterEvent2?code=09sumf&header=abf|pg||
nt|mariner1: -- Players and Results   - standings all events|pg||
nt|caitlin: Hi Roland and Hi Shirley:)|pg||
nt|mariner1: hi Shirley|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: Rob, Caitlin |pg||
nt|mich-b: Many would advise to open the South hand 1@H rather than 2@C|pg||
nt|santyclz: If I recall correctly, pass in 1st or 2nd usually shows a hand in the 10-20hcp range not 11-14 balanced.|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|caitlin: now splinter|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@D is a transfer to @H and 4@D is a splinter in support|pg||
nt|caitlin: this should make S happy to simply bid 4H|pg||
nt|caitlin: with his diamonds|pg||
nt|caitlin: he likely thinks he has 2 spade losers so what else is there to his hand without diamond fit?|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: inking awile|pg||
nt|sybarra: wonder if he is also thinking about @H losers too |pg||
nt|sybarra: muid/tartan type opening again |pg||
nt|kareno: They can make 4@s by picking up clubs, but not eleven tricks.  I missaw a loser :)|pg||
nt|kareno: I would definitely open the hand 1@h|pg||
nt|mich-b: to avoid problems if EW preempt |pg||
nt|kareno: South got lucky that west bid only 2@s.  I surely would have bid more!!|pg||
nt|mich-b: by opening 1@H South ensures himself the chance to bid both his suits , since 1@H all pass is very much unlikely|pg||
nt|mdgraham: although if EW are playing four-suit transfers it is possible |pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 2@D here is weak in either major........ 4@H is willingness to play game in either|pg||
nt|caitlin: misunderstanding??|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@H Muiderberg/Tartan type 5M 4m+ less than opening count|pg||
nt|frankaus: typical agresive neill opening|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2N asking minor or range?|pg||
nt|frankaus: now shows second suit|pg||
nt|sybarra: playing the system at this vulnerabliity I would also |pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 nt asking minor |pg||
nt|sybarra: and forcing |pg||
nt|sharkey: Good morning|pg||
mb|3H!|an|short|nt|mariner1: all roads lead to this making it seems|pg||
nt|april7: looks like it|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and also if West can bid clubs naturally and in force mode|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 5min/4Maj/2/2 15 hcp - 1Nt it is a possible choose|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: operator, please shut down|pg||
mb|3S|nt|sybarra: oh oh |pg||
nt|mariner1: off the rails now|pg||
nt|caitlin: does S know they have agreed on hearts or what??|pg||
nt|caitlin: surely with splinter ??|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: not sure sr|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: lots of thnking happwning'|pg||
nt|mariner1: S is visualizing N as a magic hand, which rarely works|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: depending upon NT range at the other table, this auction will either be duplicated or  P-P-1N-4@H|pg||
nt|mrdct: 2@s looks to be making|pg||
nt|april7: W has very few losers, so with the big Fit andcontrols they should reach itg|pg||
mb|4C|nt|sybarra: think we heard the screech of brakes|pg||
nt|kareno: Almost totally unlikely.|pg||
nt|kareno: Now south hasn't had a chance to express his hand.  As it happens he's lucky and slam won't make.|pg||
nt|mich-b: South really had trouble here to show his suits|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: If any of the kibs know their system, any help would be appreciated.|pg||
nt|april7: 4@D now|pg||
nt|mdgraham: certainly no problem next door|pg||
mb|4S|nt|caitlin: swing here|pg||
nt|caitlin: true Rob|pg||
nt|caitlin: and those 2 spades.....how can he be so sure they are not losers??|pg||
nt|caitlin: W didnt support spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: needs to play carefully|pg||
nt|mich-b: luckily  it does not matter much this time|pg||
nt|kareno: 3@h would have been forcing over 2@s.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: more difficult if East will find 6@D and 3@C in West to understand the hand|pg||
mb|4N|nt|shevek: hello Dave, everyone :)|pg||
nt|mrdct: no point in Ish making a speculative pass of 2@Sx when leading by 50+ imps|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: We'll have names in the seats as soon as the operator has a free moment|pg||
mb|5D|nt|caitlin: question posed: would N splinter without S control?|pg||
nt|caitlin: he could have Ace but no guarantee he has AK|pg||
nt|sybarra: might make if ak of @H drop singleton |pg||
nt|mich-b: since 4@H is a good contract, and playing in @D is not really better|pg||
mb|p|nt|caitlin: a spec has asked this|pg||
nt|mariner1: got the @H right|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@S xfert (4way) for @C, 3@H sure strong hand (i don't know if it is e ralay or @D)|pg||
nt|april7: 6NT is not a good idea|pg||
nt|mdgraham: whatever it means, they seem ok now|pg||
nt|sharkey: 3H c ould be cue with @C set as trumps|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|nt|kennet: i guess E/W is Del'monte Green|pg||
nt|hausigel: hello everyone|pg||
nt|santyclz: Regardless of the bidding, they've reached a normal if optomistic spot.  The doubleton @ds in both hands reduce their chances.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|frankaus: david  was well ......... david|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mrdct: needed to lead a trump to beat 4@H so i guess some hope for Milne if 4@h bid in the open room or perhaps a 4@S sacrifice vs 4@h|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well done|pg||
nt|april7: will be a quick claim|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|pc|dA|pg||
nt|ralfwil: will N find the @d continuation?|pg||
nt|jrssd: Hi Nicoleta |pg||
nt|shevek: hi John|pg||
mc|12|nt|caitlin: they won't both duck|pg||

nt|caitlin: 11 IMP swing|pg||
nt|mariner1: nice 3N should be a push here|pg||
nt|hausigel: probably expecting partner to have a trump trick, the @CJ and @D KJ10(x)...|pg||
nt|hausigel: too much to hope for|pg||
nt|bridge_one: after the cuebid of 4@S (denying the control in D and H) the bid became easy|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ahollan1: now we'll learn a bit about EW system  -- WK NT or not -- many ACOL players in Australia|pg||
nt|chick: so a nice straightforward start, probably flat|pg||
nt|mariner1: EW play weak NT|pg||
nt|mich-b: no, he would not.... though it would be difficult to locate this card even without opps bidding..|pg||
nt|mrdct: this is the last segment of the semi-finals . 16 boards|pg||
nt|jrssd: and a big clubs system E/W?|pg||
mb|d|nt|mrdct: i dont think so|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|mariner1: S might pass. no DBL,,,,,, N would not have passed if S did|pg||
nt|mariner1: RDBL likely some sort of escape system|pg||
nt|caitlin: watch it Rob...I twice said that about basic boards and......|pg||
nt|caitlin: :))|pg||
nt|mich-b: is this a 1@S opening for you?|pg||
nt|kareno: No, it's just a shade light for me.|pg||
nt|kareno: Qx isn't a good holding and the hand is too balanced.|pg||
nt|jrssd: Final is in 24 hours|pg||
nt|mrdct: probably alerted as maybe short|pg||
nt|mrdct: 1@D = @h|pg||
nt|april7: NS  will be in 4@S, making with finding Q of @S|pg||
nt|sharkey: 4@s hinges on locating trump Q|pg||
mb|3S|nt|santyclz: Hans leads off with a midnight-swiss weak 2.|pg||
nt|itinerant: Hi all|pg||
nt|itinerant: Hi Joe|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi Ed.|pg||
nt|nickf: Hi Ed... you benched again ?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@H can be a cue bid (bec 2Nt is fit in @C, else 3@C)|pg||
mb|4C|nt|mariner1: N wondering who has what as they have more than her share|pg||
nt|caitlin: but yes should be nice 3N|pg||
nt|mich-b: then a heavy 2@S chosen here  -nice for them to have a higher range defined when Red against White|pg||
nt|kareno: Sometimes you actually have a good hand for your bid :)|pg||
nt|mich-b: 3@S , is of course just competitive, not inviting to game|pg||
nt|itinerant: hehe|pg||
nt|mrdct: EW play 1@C could be as short as 1|pg||
nt|jrssd: y, transer advances are bedoming very popular|pg||
nt|jrssd: ah, tks|pg||
nt|shevek: now east confirmed long @cs|pg||
nt|jrssd: so 1D = 4+|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|mariner1: so the redbl might have been t/o to @c|pg||
nt|mariner1: the cards sit well for 3N if they can get there|pg||
nt|caitlin: hmm|pg||
nt|mich-b: South should not raise - even not with a maximum|pg||
nt|shevek: 4+ @hs yes|pg||
nt|mrdct: 2NT might be a puppet to 3@c|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i believe NZ and OZ both use runout system where RDBL forces 2@C as runout with 1-suiter|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S certainly plays well as the cards lie|pg||
nt|caitlin: good bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: might end up in 3 @C here|pg||
nt|cindy: is 2@c game forcing ?|pg||
nt|kennet: hard to stay out of 3nt now|pg||
nt|hausigel: I hope not...|pg||
nt|hausigel: looking at the hands they open 1@H|pg||
nt|cindy: really   no game makes|pg||
nt|itinerant: i don't think Sartaj is odds-on to make this one|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ralfwil: max and 3-card @s support|pg||
nt|mdgraham: correct play in spades is ace first, taking the suit in isolation, as you can pick up a 4-0 break that way  |pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4@C is correct - give the informations at the p to defende or not|pg||
pc|hT|nt|mich-b: And east could not double that - because double would be for take out|pg||
nt|kareno: Tough lead for west.  I think he gives up something with any lead.  Club would have been his best.|pg||
nt|mich-b: though he might have hoped that West would double again -|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: N/S play 2M = 8-11 at all vulnerabilities|pg||
nt|mich-b: Ah..ok, thx|pg||
nt|kareno: I don't think east would pass a second double, though.  His vulnerable opponent is over him with the spade suit.|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: their 'trashier' weak 2 is 2@D multi (only weak option)|pg||
nt|kennet: cant remember the last time i played 2nt vul|pg||
nt|cindy: i dont think they make 3@c either|pg||
nt|jrssd: a spec says 5+ Diamond openers|pg||
nt|jrssd: along with 5 card majors|pg||
nt|mrdct: makes sense if @C are 1|pg||
nt|sharkey: But E opened the bidding - let's see|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sybarra: oh well so much for my crystal ball|pg||
nt|mich-b: still KQ97 is a powerful holding, and North may not have too many entries|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|cindy: S is feeling ill, no doubt|pg||
nt|hausigel: I am under the impression they don't know what they're doing|pg||
nt|mdgraham: however three rounds of hearts may be a problem|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|sybarra: was 2 nt relay maybe?|pg||
nt|t 2: hello all|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ahollan1: McCallum will be able to play this almost double dummy after the 1N opener|pg||
nt|caitlin: forcing and choose your game .....don't understand the 3@H bid|pg||
nt|mariner1: E has no real good lead here........|pg||
nt|caitlin: they play 'standard'|pg||
nt|caitlin: so should be forcing to 4S or 3N|pg||
nt|cindy: there is evidence of that|pg||
nt|kennet: gee!!|pg||
nt|itinerant: ironically enough, Sartaj (hans) would advocate a takeout double on the north cards in the pass-out seat|pg||
pc|h8|nt|mariner1: my personal preference is PASS forces P to REDBL - in case it is our hand..... redbl|pg||
nt|mariner1: = stayman.. and transfers on... 2@C to 2@D...... and if I pass and then bid @c its this|pg||
nt|mariner1: hand|pg||
nt|mariner1: Q@H on side allows this|pg||
nt|mariner1: well should make 2|pg||
nt|kareno: Thanks, Andy.  So their 2M is a little like a Bailey 2 bid (for the west coasters in the US)|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|t 2: good start to the defence otherwise looks like you can make 11|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ralfwil: 2 rounds of @s and a small @d|pg||
nt|mariner1: whatever NS play is not standard :)|pg||
nt|kennet: still 1 of i think|pg||
nt|april7: could be on a trump reduction play|pg||
nt|bridge_one: void in @S, so for East is easy the return in @h to ruff from dummy|pg||
pc|s8|nt|caitlin: well transfers but other than that??|pg||
nt|april7: Ace of @S and then reduce trumps in hand|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mariner1: the @H out helps the defense|pg||
nt|mich-b: I have seen this style before (having 2 different weak 2 bids)|pg||
nt|kareno: east under pressure already.|pg||
nt|santyclz: Do some pairs revert to penalty x's of preempts playing vs this pair?|pg||
nt|itinerant: I guess if he's willing to open 2H on this, he's willing to try many things|pg||
nt|itinerant: lol|pg||
nt|itinerant: In their defence, specs should note that first chair, favourable, ain't such a bad time to try this|pg||
nt|mrdct: 10 tricks if he gets @D right|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ralfwil:  @c of sourse|pg||
nt|sybarra: didnt look std. to me either |pg||
nt|jrssd: this will prob make, perhaps with an overtrick|pg||
pc|s3|nt|caitlin: no alerts|pg||
nt|sybarra: having been an operator, sometimes we dont get all the alerts in |pg||
nt|caitlin: who know:)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|chick: and 3-3 hearts|pg||
nt|mariner1: now N can score there trumps or force E to over ruff|pg||
nt|mariner1: their|pg||
nt|t 2: e-w playing some type of smith i assume so ish should get this right|pg||
nt|t 2: no real cost ducking and getting another signal|pg||
nt|phycodurus: Hi all|pg||
nt|phycodurus: we should be going out to recruit spectators, because this si a great table|pg||
nt|t 2: haha yeah|pg||
nt|phycodurus: Del monte 7 Green were on fire in the 1st set today|pg||
nt|phycodurus: (no typing skills)|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|chick: with 3 more heart tricks, he still needs 2 more ... would you go after spades or clubs?|pg||
nt|mrdct: which i think he should|pg||
nt|april7: yes, thats should wotk|pg||
nt|bridge_one: it would need start with A in @C and @C ruff|pg||
nt|april7: right distirbution in W|pg||
pc|dK|nt|april7: 10 of @SA, @C @C ruff and so on|pg||
pc|d2|nt|cindy: dont think there is anyway the def can screw up|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mariner1: I would have ducked the opening @D lead|pg||
nt|mich-b: but , personally, I think this is a waste to have 2 different ways to show similar hands, even though it does provide better definition|pg||
nt|santyclz: I'd rather bid 1@h, it has more preemptive value.|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|sybarra: and if the teams have discussed the systems,  they just dont do the alerts as we would do for operator to see |pg||
nt|jrssd: West has no entry to give East a H ruff|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s5|nt|sybarra: so dont think that is a clue Caitlin |pg||
nt|caitlin: very true|pg||
nt|hausigel: as a spec pointed out to me, @CQ shift would have done|pg||
nt|hausigel: :)|pg||
nt|cindy: haha|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|cindy: that  would be like the @d shift on previous hand|pg||
nt|t 2: and ish gets it right, so only 10 now|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|sK|nt|phycodurus: time for a quick claim|pg||
nt|t 2: or possibly 9|pg||
pc|h7|pc|d6|nt|ahollan1: the system used south of the equator [and by me for 30+ years] has the runner showing weak 1/2 suiters rather than any bids that ask opener|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but -- Pass does force RDBL for either penalty or one of the 2-suiters|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: players getting water|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes the kibbers are telling me that...........|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|kareno: Good duck.  Now if east shifts to spades, he can't get in again.|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mariner1: S needed to play 10@D there|pg||
nt|hausigel: actually...|pg||
nt|hausigel: @S7 gave away the contract|pg||
nt|hausigel: (in theory) of course, one has to win the @S8 to make 3@H|pg||
nt|april7: suicide|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cJ|nt|t 2: ok 10 no|pg||
nt|t 2: now*|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|nt|mariner1: @H was best there|pg||
pc|d8|pc|c9|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c8|pc|dJ|nt|kareno: Making 3|pg||
nt|jrssd: 3D is a better bid if pard is nice enough to hold 4 of them|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: perfect fitting hand from south|pg||
nt|mariner1: EW have 4@H and even 5|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS might get to a save in|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3nt on EW and only 4 tricks for defence in @h|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@S showing 5 very bad @S's :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: a funky weak 2 bid?|pg||
nt|hausigel: looks like a good - but hopeless - 4@h contract|pg||
nt|phycodurus: why do I always habve to commentate the flat sets?|pg||
nt|t 2: you poor thing|pg||
nt|johnnybear: hello all, it seems I'm taking over from Nick?|pg||
nt|santyclz: 1nt is 11-14 balanced.  I wonder how that snuck into their system.|pg||
nt|itinerant: Welcome Henri Schweitzer from Montpellier in France and John Hornibrook from Sydney|pg||
nt|johnnybear: And Ed, I take it this is an anxious commentary from you?|pg||
nt|ritong: hi there:)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i haven't understood what happened|pg||
mb|1D|nt|mariner1: 5@D make, and even 3n makes|pg||
nt|kennet: 4 spades here i guess|pg||
nt|hausigel: with a different vulnerability it would be much easier|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sybarra: 3n because k of @C in the slot |pg||
nt|mariner1: 5@D makes because N has no effective lead|pg||
mb|d|nt|mariner1: S might have tried 4@S there....... I think I would have|pg||
nt|mariner1: or he has his @c and @D mixed together for a muiderberg|pg||
nt|frankaus: aussie W2 green V red is not to pretty|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi Henri, John.|pg||
nt|itinerant: for those who haven't seen Ware-McManus before, they play a homegrown system called "Crunch"|pg||
nt|bridge_one: it seem to have lose AK@H A@D Q@S ...|pg||
mb|3S!|an|weak|nt|mariner1: 4@S does make as long as N plays carefully|pg||
nt|ahollan1: probable 4@S, but possible 3@H try?|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3@S just allows W too much flexibility|pg||
nt|chick: pretty flat, no ruffing value|pg||
nt|mariner1: no defense though and NV vs VUL|pg||
nt|kareno: Neither north nor south has an opening bid IMO.  |pg||
nt|Walddk4: welcome Cindy|pg||
nt|cindy: hi all :)|pg||
nt|hausigel: hi|pg||
nt|hausigel: 2NT a heart raise, no doubt - probably only invitational|pg||
nt|kennet: one of those contracts where you dont know who makes what so i think 4spades |pg||
nt|t 2: n-s probably playing transfers over 1c, so 1s denying a major|pg||
nt|jrssd: this is not the bidding of our parents!|pg||
nt|mrdct: NS might try for a slam here - but surely will be able to work out they are off the @HAK|pg||
nt|april7: 5@D a good save against 4 @S|pg||
mb|4C|nt|mariner1: green meaning GO or NV :)|pg||
nt|cindy: thats a light takeout dbl|pg||
nt|itinerant: pass in 1st and 2nd chair is 0-6 or 15-20|pg||
nt|ritong: that why mcmanus BBO nick is mattcrunch|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3-0 spades means it's a phantom, though|pg||
mb|4S|nt|mariner1: 8 tricks seem tough to me|pg||
nt|frankaus: neills's leb action at the top of the range here|pg||
nt|hausigel: 2 club ruffs|pg||
nt|cindy: they did well to stay at 3|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|ralfwil: and now 11 tricks. I don´t think S can find @h|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: I would just bid game..... telling defense nothing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: karen plays carefully -- but sometimes her bidding is considered --- agressively creative :)|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: 2s intermediate|pg||
nt|mariner1: you have a hand worth between 0 and 4 with a partner that is showing a weak suit|pg||
nt|mariner1: with and opener and a strong forcing RHO|pg||
nt|cindy: if N reads it|pg||
mb|d|nt|mariner1: here N has to ruff the 4th @H with the 10 to be sure W can't over ruff|pg||
nt|ahollan1: play looks pretty automatic -- ruff @H twice - 2nd time with @S10|pg||
nt|kareno: And if south's is an opening bid, then north's can't make a try!!|pg||
nt|mrdct: nice stop|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: Rob,  you take the @C finesse early?|pg||
nt|mariner1: no play to make except the @c hook|pg||
nt|mich-b: I would open the North hand , for sure|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: Yes, the north hand is better.  I would open it only in third chair.|pg||
nt|mich-b: I think in 3rd chair , there is some merit to opening the North hand 1@S|pg||
nt|kareno: Much merit, Michael.|pg||
nt|mich-b: more preemptive,and more lead-directing|pg||
nt|phycodurus: 11 tricks without much trouble|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: ty Rhys|pg||
nt|bridge_one: ok, sry - i seen now - finesse in @C before after K in @D ducked by West|pg||
pc|sA|nt|itinerant: 1H is 7-10 any and, apart from some relays, everything else is pretty natural|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but you would be wary of defending at this vulnerability|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4@S was down 1|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kennet: 11 now|pg||
nt|cindy: huh ?|pg||
pc|s7|nt|mariner1: yes you are always off anyway and you need to play to make it|pg||
nt|mich-b: declarer is really in serious shortage of tricks|pg||
nt|hausigel: whats the point of this @D shift?|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|mariner1: you could run 4@D however that would get you no where|pg||
nt|sybarra: may be asking if the club k is on side |pg||
nt|kareno: He can make three spade tricks but is unlikely to take that line I think.|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d7|nt|april7: if 2 @H losers are not cashed then 4@S makes|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|pg||
nt|cindy: no idea but lucky they arent in 4|pg||
nt|mrdct: somewhat unlucky that @H aren't 3-1 which could put 5@S in danger|pg||

nt|kareno: Duck completely, then ace then finesse.  Well done.|pg||
pc|d8|pc|s3|nt|mariner1: actually the 4th @H sets up so no need to ruff|pg||
nt|phycodurus: Ok, maybe only 10 now|pg||
nt|t 2: think there was always only 10|pg||
nt|phycodurus: had South retsined a @D tenace 9by hookingthe 10 onthe 2nd round|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|mariner1: listening to a Mozart Concerto and Bridge,,,,,, does it get any better? :)|pg||
nt|phycodurus: I thnk he could have applied red suit pressure to both E 7 W|pg||
nt|johnnybear: not much to the hand, declarer of course forgoes the trump finesse to take diamond pitches. Then he can lead up to the @hK for an overtrick|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|pc|cJ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|mariner1: running out of spots here|pg||
pc|s8|pc|d9|nt|kareno: That diamond misguess is costly - gives east an entry for the club.  |pg||
pc|s6|nt|sybarra: not sure E will see hand again |pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mdgraham: on  2, declarer tried the trump reduction, but @DA was taken at the first opportunity, and North had too many trumps in the end-game  |pg||
pc|s9|pc|d3|pc|d6|pg||
pc|h2|nt|kareno: The two of spades is a telling card.  East has nothing between the 2 and the jack.|pg||

nt|ralfwil: 3 boards in 15 minutes|pg||

nt|mariner1: looking like 5/4s here for push too|pg||
nt|hausigel: a grand! a grand!|pg||
nt|mrdct: bacl to back voids for south|pg||
mb|1D|nt|itinerant: shows spades, 10-20pts|pg||
nt|johnnybear: so Ed what is the diamond opening?|pg||
nt|itinerant: interesting choice|pg||
mb|1H|nt|mariner1: not I maybe a different similarly named person|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh yes,  not always easy |pg||
nt|mariner1: 1@S E was an interesting spot in Open|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: was cold on fin but didnt take it|pg||
nt|sybarra: making 4 even more interesting |pg||
nt|mariner1: 5@H make it interesting|pg||
nt|kennet: cold 6 hearts here |pg||
nt|cindy: think they have a club loser|pg||
nt|jrssd: not a great hand to find a Heart fit...|pg||
nt|mrdct: pass is 0-6 or a couple of different 15-20 hands|pg||
nt|shevek: evryone should try to defend here|pg||
nt|shevek: every*|pg||
nt|jrssd: well, Diamons make 3|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: just confirmed Lynn actually won a Venice Cup with Karen in Perth Australia|pg||
nt|mariner1: so the score on 3 was corrected to off 1|pg||
nt|mariner1: so he did not hook @c and went off|pg||
nt|hausigel: 7@D|pg||
nt|kennet: 7dia right:)|pg||
nt|cindy: yes !   the @hs had a hold on me|pg||
nt|hausigel: makes on any layout (except @H ruff at trick 1)|pg||
nt|mrdct: interesting choice for south here|pg||
nt|jrssd: I thk we should call North's pass a "laundry list' bid|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mariner1: wondering who you were asking|pg||
nt|chick: some number of NT here ... 12 tricks on a non-diamond lead|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N the top EW spot|pg||
nt|phycodurus: anyway,leave it to the GIBs|pg||
nt|johnnybear: everything else pretty much natural, huh? :)|pg||
nt|itinerant: 1s = INV + relay|pg||
nt|mrdct: he probably doesnt have a conventional overcall that describes this hand|pg||
nt|jrssd: many possibilites|pg||
mb|5C|nt|sybarra: ooof |pg||
nt|kareno: The range for an opening 2NT has dropped.  Now most seem to include 19.|pg||
nt|cindy: N/S have good save|pg||
nt|kennet: me told , always majors , have to stop playing matchpoints:)|pg||
nt|hausigel: 3@S should wake South up|pg||
nt|itinerant: ha|pg||
nt|itinerant: shows balanced|pg||
nt|itinerant: 2H relay coming up|pg||
nt|santyclz: Natural in the "little major" sense of the word.|pg||
nt|jrssd: Dbl is negative, no doubt|pg||
nt|april7: 6@C might be the end|pg||
mb|5H|nt|frankaus: lilley will X  - nagy will bid 5@S|pg||
nt|kennet: well east must get exited now|pg||
nt|hausigel: nice bidding so far|pg||
nt|cindy: we dont want to hear only 4@s by S|pg||
nt|mrdct: a good time to have a natural 2@d overcall in your system|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not sure if South can bid 6@C wth any assurance, though|pg||
nt|april7: it won't work because of bad @D break|pg||
nt|mdgraham: indeed|pg||
mb|6C|nt|cindy: ugh|pg||
nt|shevek: 3@c is fit showing non-jump|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 6@C work|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: now the @D lead is assured I think|pg||
nt|mariner1: ooops not @D bid,,,,,,,,,, would not have made that much sense anyway|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: sorry my mouse keeps misclicking|pg||
nt|mariner1: must be related to my rodent :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: E is the one thinking here|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: yes probably, i am on the other side of the screen|pg||
nt|mariner1: N and E share one side and S and W the other|pg||
nt|mariner1: no clue|pg||
nt|phycodurus: hate this 2NT bid, but certainly East has a tough rebid after 2@D, in standard methods|pg||
nt|itinerant: if you're unfamiliar with relays, basically one player asks and the other tells|pg||
nt|itinerant: hmmm|pg||
nt|itinerant: this is an interesting diversion|pg||
nt|mrdct: now south is quite happy to defend and also happy he didnt have a bid to show a red 2-suiter|pg||
nt|jrssd: another modern trend, Negative Doubles when the opponents bid over your 1N|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 2@D here a form of multi or at least a weak major.....|pg||
nt|hausigel: East has a problem. can he make a cuebid that doesn't sound like a signoff?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: also with @S 4/2|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: probably ONLY weak 2@H or 2@S|pg||
nt|sybarra: here we go per Frank's prediction |pg||
nt|kareno: Ahhh.. here I was being facetious and their range actually does include 19 :)|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: E/W uses multi 2@D to show 21-22|pg||
nt|mich-b: I think one should try to open 2NT as rarely as possible , because finding your fits (especially in minors) is tricky after the space consuming 2nt|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sybarra: S got he lead director in .....(just kidding|pg||
nt|cindy: well..lets see, wonder where Ws points are with all that bidding|pg||
nt|hausigel: 5@S first round control|pg||
nt|hausigel: after all, you have to bid all four suits once in your life|pg||
nt|april7: does N play on @D or on @S, that is the question!|pg||
nt|bridge_one: go down if declarer begin with K @D, but if he play safe can make 12 tricks|pg||
nt|mdgraham: very brave 6@C bid, trusting his partner's bidding - @DK is a useful card |pg||
nt|april7: @S and @S ruff and so on|pg||
nt|april7: K of @D is a big card for S on this bidding|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Q in @S and small @C from North i think it is correct- what think comm ?|pg||
nt|april7: ruff ace and Q of @C!|pg||
nt|april7: cash !Q of @S first|pg||
nt|bridge_one: ruff od course - Q of @C may be better that small versus the J ...|pg||
pc|h8|nt|mariner1: E might try one more time|pg||
nt|frankaus: i played these two in the qual of seniors they got us 7-23|pg||
nt|kareno: They have their bids fine-tuned using Multi.|pg||
nt|t 2: i think you have to do something with the E cards|pg||
nt|phycodurus: Big positipon by Barnes; I don't like the auction either, but he doesn't have the hand to X it|pg||
nt|jrssd: that's a very thin bid, vul|pg||
nt|shevek: north just turned a plus into a minus|pg||
pc|h7|nt|mariner1: EW have a little issue here|pg||
nt|t 2: wow porter instantly leading QD|pg||
nt|phycodurus: well, you can't pass the E cards, that's for sure; if 2Nt is a max 3 card @D raise it's a nice gadget|pg||
nt|t 2: after N i believe asked for a spade|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: jeddy tanking|pg||
nt|cindy: are they behind screens ?|pg||
nt|hausigel: come on - 6@S -..|pg||
nt|kennet: yes|pg||
nt|hausigel: you don't often get 7-card support for partner's suit|pg||
nt|hausigel: and zero defense|pg||
pc|c2|nt|kareno: There go some diamond tricks for the defense.  I'd rather lead a diamond than a club from this hand at any level including 6!!|pg||
nt|kennet: at least the play will be fast|pg||
nt|april7: ducked by E|pg||
pc|c5|nt|kennet: claim|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c8|pg||
nt|mariner1: EW in previous session for Hoffman played minorwood.......|pg||
nt|ralfwil: sensible contract. |pg||
nt|mariner1: j out makes it toughest on S,,,,,, except that one|pg||
nt|bridge_one: why not Q@S before to play @C ?!?|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|itinerant: 8 top tricks here after the DA disappears|pg||
pc|h3|nt|phycodurus: East may defeat himself here|pg||
pc|c6|nt|chick: W has bypassed the @D cuebid, so E should give up|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|mariner1: I should say the OTHER EW in previous sessions|pg||
nt|itinerant: then 2 heart ruffs for 9|pg||
nt|jrssd: it's thin at any vul, actually :)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|t 2: however S may think that N was doubling because of the invitational auction with both hands being kind of limited and knowing there was bad breaks, who knows|pg||
nt|bridge_one: make slam bec @S 3/3 now|pg||
pc|d5|nt|phycodurus: North is specualting - maybe a 40 imp down kind of specualtion|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|pg||
nt|mariner1: now it makes|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d7|nt|mrdct: east choosing wisely to grab some @S tricks rather than stop @h ruffs|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mariner1: I think W expected E to have strong balanced type hand.......|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|itinerant: club hook makes 10?|pg||
nt|april7: if he would have cashed Q of @S then @S ruff and Ace of @C and so on|pg||
nt|bridge_one: now down - played only @D 3/2|pg||
nt|april7: @S brakes so he makes it|pg||
pc|hK|nt|caitlin: As I mentioned earlier...the Haughie team is here by one board which they won on appeal|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bridge_one: can still make with @S 3/3 sry|pg||
pc|h2|pc|c9|pg||
nt|april7: ruff, Qof @S and ace of @C and table is high|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mariner1: to see results in other room CLICK  MOVIE on TOOLBAR and then OPEN or|pg||
pc|cK|nt|t 2: yeah|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mariner1: CLOSED|pg||
nt|itinerant: perhaps try to set up the 4th diamond first - then no need for th eclub hook|pg||
nt|johnnybear: yes, although he will probably test the diamonds for a 3-3 break first|pg||
nt|johnnybear: damn I need to type faster|pg||
nt|jrssd: Just like "yards per play" in football, a good bridge statistic is "plusses to minusses"|pg||
pc|h4|pg||

nt|vugrapha4: yes 12 tricks - 6 clubs, 3 spades and 3 hearts|pg||
nt|mariner1: Hoffman needed that to close up the match some|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a @d instead of @h and also pitched a @d on @hK|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: sr missed 1 card in last|pg||
nt|hausigel: another possible @D slam here, but not a very good one|pg||
nt|cindy: another slam|pg||
nt|kennet: West is checking its not the same hand from before|pg||
nt|phycodurus: I imagine that words are being exchanged|pg||
nt|santyclz: No losing options.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: a not so friendly hand |pg||
nt|mariner1: you can make 3 @H or same score if o's are in 2@H :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha4: interesting hand ...|pg||
nt|kareno: I open 5/5 in the blacks 1@c for ease of rebids.  |pg||
nt|mich-b: the NS hand here looks to have good potential , even slam is quite good ... |pg||
nt|mich-b: but not with the 4-1 breaks in both majors|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: without diamond lead they had 12 tricks off the top|pg||
nt|mariner1: right|pg||
nt|kennet: but it makes|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mariner1: 3N makes any lead,,,,,,, and 5@D|pg||
nt|mariner1: though you may only make 2 NS|pg||
nt|itinerant: Green-delmonte stopped out of game on board 1 so a few more imps to Horwitz|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but could make also with @S 4/2 |pg||
mb|p|nt|mich-b: opening 1@C is fine , if the bidding stays low until it gets back to you , if opps compete, you might have trouble bidding your @Ss|pg||
nt|mrdct: another modern trend here of preempting even when holding the other Major|pg||
nt|jrssd: stole the hand|pg||
nt|shevek: what Major?|pg||
nt|jrssd: 3N is cold EW|pg||
mb|1N|nt|mariner1: 3N might do extras from N as E might not lead a @c|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: act mabye not so interesting|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: I think EW can make 3N here|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mariner1: kibbers pointing out that the moysian 4@S also makes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think this is insteresting bidding situation - especially for pairs playing "Walsh" where 1@D says no 4 card major or strong hand [some say invitational+ others game force]|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: the thing is -- so many play checkback, but what is there to check for after 1@C-1@D ??|pg||
nt|kareno: You can't shut out the spade suit.|pg||
nt|itinerant: it's been a couple of years since i had a go wit hthis system, but i'm 100% confident that Ware now knows Mcmanus's entire shape|pg||
nt|itinerant: his strength is still 10-20|pg||
mb|p|nt|mich-b: Mullamphy gave up on trying to play in @Hs|pg||
nt|t 2: bit pushy by north maybe|pg||
nt|t 2: but again, 40 down|pg||
pc|h2|nt|april7: 2@H by W|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mariner1: W has to play 10@S or DUCK an opening S lead from N|pg||
nt|phycodurus: 4@s optimisitic but an inevitable bid at the vulnerability|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: another obscure/obnoxious topic from Al :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: S realizing N can't have their NT range so closes the bidding out|pg||
nt|kareno: I don't like the opening lead.|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|mariner1: now it makes 13|pg||
nt|mich-b: what would you lead, Karen?  a @C?|pg||
nt|kareno: Jxxx is very dangerous and proves so here.|pg||
nt|hausigel: nice double. just in case, tell them that he cannot ruff out the spades|pg||
pc|s8|nt|mariner1: only way to make slam is not be in one|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mariner1: good start|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, a club.|pg||
nt|itinerant: is the miracle slam actually a make here?|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|shevek: well, they need 54 imps and they need them quickly....|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|caitlin: I would have made a more passive lead not from KJxxx|pg||
nt|cindy: has to ruff two hearts|pg||
nt|cindy: one|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mariner1: win and knock out @D now|pg||
nt|santyclz: 6@cs plays nicely.|pg||
nt|johnnybear: It seems that provided declarer plays to ruff a diamond early (and return to hand via trumps rather than ruffing) things could go okay|pg||
nt|jrssd: that's a start, anyway|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hQ|nt|mich-b: the defense slipped here|pg||
nt|mich-b: they must play @C to shorten the dummy|pg||
nt|johnnybear: although quite possibly one would feel close to apologising to the opponents afterwards...?|pg||
nt|johnnybear: ruff a HEART early. sorry.|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|april7: in hand 3 4@S should go down on ace of @D lead and signal for @H switch!|pg||
pc|sA|nt|santyclz: Hi folks, sorry I'm late.|pg||
nt|phycodurus: they have the internet in the afterlife now?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Wireless.|pg||
nt|phycodurus: tish boom|pg||
nt|johnnybear: and yes, Joe is of course right, 6@c plays much better|pg||
pc|s7|nt|chick: must put in the 10@D though|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ritong: bravissimo|pg||
nt|ritong: slightly under the fatal 50%, but well done, particularly in this score context|pg||
nt|santyclz: Certainly too good for Roland.|pg||
nt|ritong: no doubt about that:)|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|johnnybear: in 6@c declarer's task is much easier: he will ruff a diamond, and take two discards on spades after drawing trumps|pg||
nt|ritong: an other way to pput it is 5+5+1+1=12|pg||
nt|johnnybear: another advantage, I suppose, is picking up Jxxx in spades with West, which is not unlikely after the dbl|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|kareno: Yes, they need to tap the dummy and they've failed to do so.|pg||
nt|phycodurus: I don't quite understand Ish's problem|pg||
pc|h4|nt|vugrapha4: south is holding JH|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ahollan1: i only see 12 -- @H lead didn't have chance to go into declarer's tenace because of stiff ace|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|mich-b: West's ruff put them in a difficult place|pg||
nt|itinerant: NS will be pleased here - in the first set they were on the wrong end of TWO marginal slam decisions|pg||

nt|mich-b: perhaps wWest would keep better control by not ruffing.. but honestly this is a dificult hand to defend|pg||
nt|kareno: Another ghoulie|pg||
nt|mich-b: 6NT by NS is safe ..and looks ok|pg||
nt|kareno: The opening lead created the situation |pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, notrump, NOT diamonds!!|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: easy 4@S here NS|pg||
nt|ahollan1: another weak NT -- will Jagelman come in with a bid showing both majors?|pg||
nt|mariner1: well now NS might defend here|pg||
nt|mich-b: yes :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|phycodurus: fancy a X by South at the vul, anyone?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Too good for a weak 2?|pg||
nt|itinerant: heh - he's not colour blind|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: yep no real way for S not to come in with this holding|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS can make 4@H with careful play here|pg||
nt|mariner1: this is the antepenultimate board of this session|pg||
nt|sybarra: Klinger opened the hand 4 @H in 3rd position |pg||
nt|ahollan1: our room crashed during the play of penultimate board -- so we thought score was 0 - 0  :)|pg||
nt|mich-b: in theory, the interesting 7@C is probably not bad|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: what convention uses 2@H to show both majors???|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@S seems a tad shy to me.....|pg||
nt|sybarra: hi Al  |pg||
nt|inquiry: and it essentially is now.... |pg||
nt|mich-b: anyway we are more likely to play 3@S X here ?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|caitlin: second round scheduled for about 25 minutes from now|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://online.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php - BBO Vugraph Schedule (set|pg||
nt|mariner1: up to show times for your area) next session is sheduled for 52 minutes from now|pg||
nt|caitlin: so all come back for sure:) this is close|pg||
nt|ahollan1: amazing set -- BOTH matches have exchanged over 90 imps|pg||
nt|caitlin: 52?|pg||
nt|mariner1: EW playing 1N was in interesting spot|pg||
nt|ritong: hmm..|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: Dont does|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thank you lynn's deas and baker -- DONT|pg||
nt|mariner1: finding the Q@D would be the winning ticket assuming both @H hooks are taken and|pg||
nt|mariner1: lost|pg||
nt|hausigel: any reason not to bid 2@D?|pg||
nt|ritong: not a good hand for the strong pass, i guess|pg||
nt|johnnybear: so presumably Ware confirms the 15-21?|pg||
nt|johnnybear: well if they play 6@c again I will be very impressed|pg||
nt|ritong: although, aven with a strong >NT start, uneasy to declare 6@c anyway|pg||
nt|ritong: even*|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mariner1: N should have made at least an invite I think|pg||
nt|phycodurus: no matter, Barnes is here to bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 5:45 my time is what it says|pg||
nt|Walddk5: 1400 on best defence|pg||
nt|Walddk5: In  real life only 1100 I think|pg||
nt|kareno: Red against black, that's a far-out preempt!!|pg||
nt|mich-b: Roland, how would you describe the 3@S bid?|pg||
nt|itinerant: 3D splinter here?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: I'd rather not comment|pg||
nt|kareno: Roland :)|pg||
nt|mich-b: Irresponsible?|pg||
nt|kareno: My comment is 'feh'|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Vul against not, passed partner|pg||
nt|mich-b: being aggressive and all is nice..but ...|pg||
nt|hausigel: 3@H is just what he deserved for bidding 2@S|pg||
nt|santyclz: Not really.  Might undermine partnership confidence.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 3N also had play|pg||
nt|mariner1: so EW steal a good one here probably|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3@C a bergen type @H raise|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: 7-9 4 support i think they said|pg||
nt|mariner1: all should check the schedule link to be sure|pg||
nt|kareno: And imagine if n/s play 6@d in the open room!!|pg||
nt|itinerant: ouch|pg||
nt|april7: NS might reach 5@D , better than 3NT|pg||
pc|sA|nt|santyclz: Replace a @s with a @d and it's much closer.|pg||
nt|shevek: now this is not a bad contract at all|pg||
nt|mrdct: looks like he's going to lose 2@H and 1@D here for a make|pg||
pc|s6|nt|caitlin: right Rob|pg||
nt|johnnybear: All is not lost, North does have a fantastic hand for a slam|pg||
nt|itinerant: WOW!|pg||
nt|ritong: yeah|pg||
nt|april7: switch to @C |pg||
pc|s7|nt|ralfwil: looks now like 9 tricks|pg||
nt|caitlin: 8:45 Eastern yes|pg||
nt|frankaus: was just on 100 f most days in canberra at this time of the year - if u  like that - and want to play top level bridge  - check out this tournament in mid late january each year|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.summerfestivalofbridge.com/  - Tournament site|pg||
nt|Walddk5: In the other match it was flat: 2@SX-3 at both tables, 800|pg||
nt|kareno: 2 is an overbid - too many losers in his suit.  |pg||
nt|cindy: no entry   this wont be pretty|pg||
nt|hausigel: I am advised that 2@D is nonforcing (equal level conversion)|pg||
nt|cindy: dont you think E contributed by bidding 2C with that wasted @sQ ?|pg||
nt|hausigel: I dont think the @SQ should matter much when bidding 2@C|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|sybarra: Jeddy being a bit bashful here maybe?|pg||
nt|cindy: if W has a good hand, E will most likely get a chance to bid later|pg||
nt|ritong: aarrgghh|pg||
nt|itinerant: or rather OW!|pg||
nt|johnnybear: and it seems 3NT merely confirms the balanced shape rather than denying a fit|pg||
pc|s8|nt|johnnybear: awww|pg||
pc|d5|nt|bridge_one: after 8 in @S 9 tricks |pg||
nt|april7: always 9 tricks now. |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mariner1: in Seniors Hoffman has jumped their lead further  54  Newman 23|pg||
nt|mich-b: West could save a trick by playing one round of trumps..|pg||
nt|cindy: im just saying he bid 2C with 3 hcp  and a QJ at that|pg||
nt|hausigel: I dont think he will get a good chance to bid his suit later|pg||
nt|hausigel: at the 3-level, if at all|pg||
nt|cindy: then thats ok  since they cant makea game|pg||
nt|hausigel: but pass first and 3@C later might be considered as (game-)forcing|pg||
nt|cindy: why is that ?|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|kareno: Seems reasonable.|pg||
nt|johnnybear: I imagine claim 12 quickly and get cracking with big smiles|pg||
pc|h9|nt|phycodurus: in the battle between partnership  confidence, and personal heroism, most bridge players settle on the latter...|pg||
nt|phycodurus: but yes, the single @S would be more attractive|pg||
nt|johnnybear: save those horrible thoughts until the end of the session...|pg||
nt|april7: double dummy on @C lead and after ace of @S @C again|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|chick: he might be able to avoid the @DQ problem by pitching a diamond on the spade|pg||
nt|mich-b: NOw NS can score the @H ruff in South|pg||
nt|hausigel: so it seems like a terrible waste of bidding space|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: klinger was bashful too --- but at least he got bonus for vul game|pg||
nt|caitlin: easier at other table where W opened 4@H in third seat:)|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Yes, and 1400|pg||
nt|cindy: i think its better than misleading partner|pg||
nt|hausigel: well thats my point. I dont find it misleading. its a purely competitive action in the first place|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|mariner1: it was 33 23 at break|pg||
nt|kareno: I'd think queen of spades is normal trick 2|pg||
nt|cindy: well maybe not   3@h wasnt really necessary i guess|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|jrssd: btw, our vugraph operator is Jane Reynolds. and It's a difficult task|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mariner1: our next session is scheduled for about 45 minutes.........|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://online.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php - BBO Vugraph Schedule (set|pg||
nt|mariner1: up to show times for your area)|pg||
nt|frankaus: this year the casino  was adjacent to the venue - so  if u still have "lose change" u dont have far to go|pg||
nt|sybarra: nice :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: two more boards left to play here|pg||
nt|mariner1: Shirley will BBO send us next year? :)|pg||
nt|hausigel: interesting point made by a spec: would an immediate 3@C jump (over 1NT) be a weak jump?|pg||
nt|cindy: ill be leaving you guys in a minute    have fun|pg||
nt|cindy: i think so because would dbl with a good hand|pg||
nt|hausigel: good point|pg||
nt|t 2: replace a spade with a diamond and its auto imo, but i dont think so on the hand|pg||
pc|c8|nt|sybarra: wouldnt that be nice |pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe they need operators?|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|mariner1: well has it now anyway|pg||
nt|mrdct: Jane is also the on-site supervisor for BBO today|pg||
nt|jrssd: thank you Jane!|pg||
nt|shevek: she's doing a wonderful job|pg||
nt|april7: thats 9th trick|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ahollan1: 2@S seems timid -- makes more sense after interference over a Strong NT --- vs WK NT game still high probability|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mich-b: sometimes (Vul against not) you just know that you cant outbid your opponents .. so a better tactic is keep quite , and surprise them with bad breaks|pg||
nt|kareno: Indeed.|pg||
nt|mich-b: scoring a ruff with a singleton trump is always a special satisfaction :)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|caitlin: harder with 1@H and partner, passed hand, then passes over the X|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|dA|nt|caitlin: lol:)|pg||
nt|henryb: Not the best game with a take out double on your left|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Klinger line much better -- he played @S at trick 2!!|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mrdct: so has a lot of running around to do getting line-ups, hand data files and opertors ready for the 4-table coverage|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|pg||
nt|henryb: Hi|pg||
pc|dK|nt|sybarra: hi Henry @H |pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry trick 3 -- only 1 trump played|pg||
nt|caitlin: Hi Al and Henry|pg||
nt|ahollan1: he got to pitch 2 clubs AND ruff once|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d7|nt|hausigel: South better takes the safe exit. nothing to gain by leading a spade|pg||
nt|april7: squeezze|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: ta all|pg||
nt|jrssd: I hear from 1st hand experience (is there such a thing?) that vugraph operator is much tougher than air traffic controller|pg||
nt|shevek: yes, I can confirm that|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: it only hard when their are yellow systems in play|pg||
nt|jrssd: I think these are so yellow, they're,,,red?|pg||
nt|mrdct: or players who hide their cards as they play them|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: mike is doing that now |pg||
nt|vugrapha4: and so is murray|pg||
pc|d8|nt|mariner1: well played|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ralfwil: To help partner 2@d from N is better than 2@s|pg||
nt|mich-b: 1700?|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 2N instead of 2@S would have been an invitational hand|pg||
nt|caitlin: still close match see you in about 45 minutes:)|pg||
nt|mariner1: and now the penultimate board of this session|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2 in @S at first trick could be more clear to switch in another suit|pg||
mb|1H|nt|hausigel: nice double fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: only part scores here... though someone could get shoved too high.....|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2 pushes and 1 imp swing so far -- but then there's the 1070 coming up|pg||
nt|mariner1: still two boards to play|pg||
nt|sybarra: wild set |pg||
nt|hausigel: EW can make 4@H...|pg||
nt|santyclz: Of course you can always claim you had a @s mixed up with your @ds...|pg||
nt|april7: but it was to late anyway|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|mariner1: this is the penultimate board|pg||
nt|hausigel: 5@D for NS|pg||

nt|caitlin: sorry thought that was last board|pg||
nt|caitlin: this and another|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: they have 3 min to play 2 boards|pg||
nt|sybarra: Klinger "took no prisoners" on the play |pg||
nt|t 2: haha|pg||
nt|johnnybear: so presumably redouble will be looking for a place to settle|pg||
nt|johnnybear: having muddied the waters sufficiently|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: only 3 minutes left on the session clock so some time warnings/penalties might come into play|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: markey in the tank|pg||
nt|Walddk5: The auction at the other table does not make a lot of sense to me|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: At the other table, 2@S shows @S+@C's 4+4+|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mariner1: 2@H by N is an aggressive finding|pg||
nt|Walddk5: I see, ty|pg||
nt|mich-b: perhaps a gadget showing 4@S+ a longer minor?|pg||
nt|kareno: And suicidal tendencies?|pg||
nt|Walddk5: 9 losers, vulnerable, too rich for me|pg||
nt|mich-b: Well, opening this hand with this gadget.... is ..well... I better keep silent|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Their 2@D/2@H/2@S shows 4+@S's + respective suits|pg||

nt|bridge_one: there are all control of black suit in East, so 9 tricks are always made- this is true. but declarer woulr work more :)|pg||
pc|h8|nt|mariner1: no way they could blame any slowness here on one team I don't think|pg||
nt|sybarra: hi Dave @H  |pg||
nt|phycodurus: I guess North was looking for a 9 card fit to punt the game|pg||
nt|santyclz: Would everyone x 2@c on this hand?|pg||
nt|itinerant: tough hand to lead from for West|pg||
nt|shevek: or similar|pg||
nt|mdgraham: very tempting for North to try 3@D |pg||
pc|hA|nt|frankaus: Neill the president of NSWBA - a hard worker for bridge at all levels |pg||
nt|mariner1: New South Wales Bridge Association?|pg||
nt|frankaus: Neill one the masterminds behind - Rubensohl convention|pg||
nt|frankaus: yes NSW = New south Wales sorry to all the non aussies|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: jeddy tanking|pg||
nt|mich-b: having a gadget is nice... using it sensibly is quite a different thing|pg||
nt|kennet: 1nt anyone?!!|pg||
nt|hausigel: not me, now that you mention it :)|pg||
nt|santyclz: You have to have a reason *not* to lead trump:  Papi|pg||
nt|shevek: swine|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ralfwil: and this was the way to find 2@d|pg||
nt|phycodurus: if it showed values, yes|pg||
nt|jrssd: they have a good scramble system|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|mariner1: tanked too long|pg||
nt|sybarra: yep|pg||
nt|Walddk5: I think I'm glad I never heard of Aspro 2's|pg||
nt|kareno: Pairs is one thing, but to commit that bid at IMPs ...|pg||
nt|mich-b: So , we had a match here , until 2 members of the Markey team , took 2 doubtful actions|pg||
nt|mich-b: and the match is almost over...|pg||
nt|phycodurus: if it showed @C, no|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sybarra: is this a slam you want to be in?|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes since it makes :)|pg||
nt|frankaus: Jeddy - has played with pepsi at cavendish a couple of times|pg||
nt|mariner1: so NS pulling away at the end of the session|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: jeddy saying mamamia|pg||
pc|s2|nt|hausigel: I am told, 2@C is very likely some astro|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|sybarra: :)  good point|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: dummy makes cashout look right after cashing @S|pg||
nt|Walddk5: It is over because the next board is the last board of the match|pg||
nt|mich-b: Bridge is often a game in which you just have to avoid big errors|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Many thanks to Andy, our splendid operator at Canberra|pg||
nt|kareno: <applause>|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mariner1: not really biddable|pg||
nt|caitlin: FSF with 10 HCP?|pg||
nt|phycodurus: I'm a little surprised Del Monte didn't try 3@D, bt I guess the 4th @H was enough to stop him|pg||
nt|jrssd: thot they were going to play 2C|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mariner1: well not making 7|pg||
nt|jrssd: oops|pg||
nt|shevek: maybe south should've passed 2@c|pg||
nt|jrssd: this will not help the cause|pg||
nt|shevek: QTx|pg||
nt|mdgraham: @DJ|pg||
pc|d7|nt|sybarra: my guess is if in slam, those major suit q's are in the opposite hands|pg||
nt|sybarra: or pointed queens I mean |pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|h9|nt|johnnybear: with the strength known to be on his left, I don't think Ware will have troubles here|pg||
pc|h3|nt|kennet: wonder whats taking so long|pg||
nt|mrdct: i think a weak NT in the open room also so might be duplicated|pg||
pc|sT|nt|mdgraham: good enough|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and now @CJ pinning???  oops|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Also thanks to our excellent commentators: Karen and Michael|pg||
nt|kareno: :)|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dK|nt|ahollan1: there goes the @H trick :(|pg||
pc|s9|pc|d8|pg||
nt|mich-b: Thanks Karen ... see you next time|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: Thanks everyone, it's been fun =)|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hT|nt|caitlin: ok so 2@C relay to 2@D to play there or start invitational sequence|pg||
pc|sA|nt|sybarra: only in 4, easy to finesse everything|pg||
nt|jrssd: I guess the result will depend on the runout system each pair is using|pg||
nt|shevek: they might have had a misunderstanding about 2@c bid|pg||
nt|shevek: north thought he was showing touching with @c|pg||
nt|mrdct: maybe south thought it was nontouching suits|pg||
nt|shevek: exactely|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: or i might have the system wrong |pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Our appreciation to the ABF for allowing us to broadcast from the NOT. Dave Thompson and Nick Fahrer have been instrumental in setting up a magnificent show|pg||
pc|c3|nt|henryb: I would have thought 1@d-1@h-1@s-3@s-4@s would be a normal unimpeachable auction|pg||
nt|mariner1: maybe not :)|pg||
pc|c6|nt|jrssd: If 2C was Clubs and another, it's somewhat greedy to go looking for a major suit fit - pard ALWAYS has Diamonds|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|april7: careful now|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
mc|7|nt|mariner1: only a matter of how many here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: good defence|pg||
nt|april7: good lead and good defence|pg||
nt|werge: What about this scenario - after 1 @H by South: EW starts against 3 NT with 5 @H-tricks, over!|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: N-S pair is silver medalist in juniors pairs from Beijing|pg||

nt|mariner1: go|pg||
nt|mariner1: and now the last of this session..........|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3N has play in N, not so much in  S|pg||
nt|mariner1: and now the last board of this session,,,,,,,,, next one in 39 minutes|pg||
nt|kareno: One more after this one :)|pg||
nt|kareno: But the match is pretty well over.|pg||
mb|1C|nt|mariner1: and then they found 6@D though|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if partner began with doubleton @CK -- then nothing can be done after cashing @CA, so - play for partner to hold K third|pg||
nt|mariner1: @c lead and one  to beat 6@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: leading J works regardless of who had @C10 |pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh -- Rob wants to move onto board 8 :)|pg||
nt|chick: this should be an opportunity for them|pg||
nt|mariner1: here is an interesting hand........|pg||
nt|ralfwil: A real nice 3@c!!|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://online.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php - BBO Vugraph Schedule (set|pg||
nt|mariner1: up to show times for your area)|pg||
nt|hausigel: 6@D again? :)|pg||
nt|jrssd: back to bridge|pg||
nt|shevek: I like mnemonics|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: we migh see a phantom save here by someone|pg||
nt|itinerant: no games contracts available here|pg||
nt|johnnybear: A few more IMPs to Milne: a 6 IMP pickup for playing 3@c after the 1NT opening, and NS in the other room have stopped in 4@s on the 6@c hand|pg||
nt|itinerant: *game contracts* even|pg||
nt|jrssd: 6D plays nicely|pg||
nt|mrdct: indeed it does|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: might|pg||
nt|Walddk5: We will be back in Australia in 14½ hours, but we will have vugraph all day and night before that. Norway, Portugal and Denmark|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Vugraph around the clock all weekend|pg||
nt|kennet: not on a heart lead:)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|jrssd: and if you can spell mnemonic, you don't need em!|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: looks overboard in terms of values|pg||
nt|itinerant: anyone for 2S on the north hand?|pg||
nt|ritong: ok i finally lost the rest of my chips with KK  here we go boys|pg||
nt|itinerant: the convenient thing is that north has already shown 0-6|pg||
nt|itinerant: welcome back Henri!|pg||
nt|ritong: ty ty dude|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ralfwil: will go down on a @c lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: well I wont be here for next session, so have fun all |pg||
nt|mariner1: a measure of Fyffe's Axiom in this session|pg||
nt|itinerant: did you lose to rockets?|pg||
nt|ritong: nah|pg||
nt|mrdct: 1@C shows @H and could have a longer side suit (canape style)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: start with right siding it anyway |pg||
nt|kareno: So, spectators, don't give up your seats!!|pg||
nt|hausigel: unbiddable, anyway|pg||
nt|ritong: lost to underpair:)|pg||
nt|itinerant: you slow-played them like a genius, didn't you!|pg||
nt|ritong: no way lol|pg||
nt|ritong: because of the final part of your assertion:)|pg||
nt|itinerant: hans's shape is emerging|pg||
mb|p|nt|hausigel: 5@C nice and simple, not much on the play|pg||
nt|santyclz: Is 6@c biddable?|pg||
nt|mrdct: 1@h will be an inv+ relay|pg||
mb|p|nt|kennet: 5 clubs comfertable spot here|pg||
nt|jrssd: do you play this system Dave?|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mariner1: I am waiting for the lead in Closed on 5, 6@D|pg||
nt|henryb: Puppet Stayman? apparently not|pg||
nt|mariner1: well it is right sided,,,,,, can E envision a @D lead?|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: thnks shirley|pg||
nt|mariner1: making 5 was very good in Open|pg||
nt|mariner1: Fyffe's Axiom : The problem-solving process will always break down at the point at|pg||
nt|mariner1: which it is possible to determine who caused the problem.|pg||
nt|t 2: i think so|pg||
nt|mrdct: looks like south will be asking all the questions here|pg||
nt|april7: 3NT is doomed on @C lead|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mariner1: 3N not the best spot here for EW|pg||
nt|henryb: why a @d rather than a @c?|pg||
nt|sybarra: not easy for @D lead (imo) with N bidding 2 @D no 4/5 card major |pg||
nt|Walddk5: A break for 1½ hours after this; that's all the sleep you'll get for the next 48 hours|pg||
nt|kareno: If Roland can do it, specs, YOU ALL can do it!|pg||
nt|phycodurus: excellent 7@C contract, although doomed somewhat by the lack of transbarent backed cards|pg||
nt|santyclz: Other than in a relay system?|pg||
nt|t 2: hard not to bid 4c now when you could be gin for 7|pg||
nt|t 2: excellent 7c?|pg||
nt|ritong: must be some slowdown proceeding|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|Walddk5: Well, they may not all be 21, Karen|pg||
nt|kareno: I certainly am NOT 21 - I'll be off to sleep after this board :)|pg||
nt|hausigel: safety play in @D|pg||
nt|t 2: off the king of trumps....|pg||
nt|phycodurus: 13 top tricks|pg||
nt|jrssd: wrong sided now|pg||
nt|mrdct: no bui had a read of their system notes on Friday night|pg||
nt|mdgraham: E needs to unblock |pg||
nt|april7: J of @C from E|pg||
nt|mdgraham: wd|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Without an very good play on @s|pg||
nt|ritong: cuz a cue would look rather optimistic:)|pg||
nt|itinerant: in the other room, Green decided on raising a strong notrump to game with AKx, Axx, x, Txxxxx|pg||
nt|johnnybear: yes, a lot of people play the cheapest bid after a reverse as real rubbish|pg||
nt|itinerant: Ish won't be happy when dummy hits but he'll love the score-up|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dA|pc|dT|nt|t 2: good bid by ish|pg||
nt|santyclz: I guess that's the easy way to get there.|pg||
nt|t 2: you're rarely missing 7c and it avoids confusion, they are a pick up partnership basically|pg||
nt|werge: Yes - top is 4 @H|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|henryb: 2@d showed no 5 card major|pg||
nt|mariner1: a big THANKS! to Adam (Australia), our superb operator, for doing an excellent|pg||
nt|mariner1: job!!!|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: both teams have now got a warning about time|pg||
nt|mariner1: Many thanks to the Caberra Summer Festival of Bridge, The Australian Bridge|pg||
nt|shevek: 2@d shows longer @c (canape)|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|vugrapha4: west seems unsure of what 3d was by east|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: explaining to south, jumping back and forth between a suit and a stopper ask|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: final conclusion "look, i really dont know"|pg||
nt|mariner1: Federation and all the organizers for helping BBO bring us the vugraphs......|pg||
nt|mariner1: and thanks for their wit and insight to my co-commentators Shirley Ybarra (USA),|pg||
nt|mariner1: Caitlin Ellen Pomer (Canada), and Roland Wald (Denmark).....I am Rob Brown|pg||
nt|mariner1: (USA)........|pg||
pc|c7|nt|mariner1: well @S makes it a calmer hand than we thought|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: rolls home now|pg||
nt|chick: yep, just 2 @Ds to lose|pg||
nt|mariner1: could be a big hand for NS|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Too much for declarer to do here when he has to knock out 4 aces|pg||
nt|Walddk5: However, the defence must be careful|pg||
nt|kareno: Too much work|pg||
nt|Walddk5: and set up an extra trick in time, like a diamond now|pg||
nt|jrssd: well done, I'll bet you did your homework as a youngster, too :)|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: most of this is shape showing if i rember corectly|pg||
nt|mrdct: i've played against them a couple of times too|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Walddk5: Now he can make it|pg||
nt|kareno: This is okay - continuing hearts risked that declarer would knock out the diamond stopper and block the heart suit from cashing.|pg||
nt|kareno: The defense seem to be at cross-purposes.|pg||
nt|Walddk5: I don't understand the point of continuing hearts when your entry has just been knocked out|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Partner returned a *low* diamond, so continue *his* suit|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|mariner1: also thanks to the Open team for dropping in and helping out!|pg||
nt|caitlin: ty all to Adam our operator other commentators and to specs always:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx Rob,  we will see every one in about 1/2 hours |pg||
nt|mrdct: they will get the shape and strength sorted out first and then will find out exactly where all the controls are|pg||
pc|cT|nt|chick: pretty natural lead given the bidding|pg||
nt|hausigel: low to the ace, then low to the 8|pg||
nt|phycodurus: see?|pg||
nt|t 2: lol|pg||
nt|santyclz: They always seem to manage to get to 3nt against me...|pg||
pc|c9|nt|Walddk5: Perhaps Reynolds is a little groggy after the 1700 he conceded a couple of boards ago|pg||
nt|santyclz: Lack of transparent backs no problem.|pg||
nt|phycodurus: very famous 7@C from the Bermuda Bowl may years ago with a simlar @C suit|pg||
nt|phycodurus: exept then the @CK was doubleton onside|pg||
nt|phycodurus: so the italians won|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: and all players have stepped out of the room|pg||
nt|phycodurus: anything else, USA...the closest ever BB, I think|pg||
nt|santyclz: And, if I recall correctly, gave their trophies to the American team.|pg||
nt|phycodurus: very nice gesture|pg||
nt|phycodurus: Kantar wrote that Eisenberg was so calm" he tried to light up his chewing gum and eat his cigarettes|pg||
nt|santyclz: It engendered a lot of discussion about whether playing the @ck on the 1st round would have set it as declarer might have tried a failing trump coup.|pg||
nt|phycodurus: yes - although i don't think so|pg||
nt|phycodurus: easy to use the @C Q as early transport &find out the true picture, IMO|pg||
nt|phycodurus: but still, with the amount of adrenaline washing around, any pressure might have been enough|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: and we are back|pg||
pc|c5|nt|jrssd: The beauty of playing 6D from S is that a trump lead loses the DQ|pg||
nt|mdgraham: of course, it might be a singleton :)|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|mariner1: Last but not least, a round of applause for our hosts: Fred, Sheri, Uday, Bill Gates,|pg||
nt|mariner1: Sharon Osberg, and David Smith. Without them there would have been no|pg||
nt|mariner1: broadcasts. Thanks a lot for creating a site that is greatly appreciated by bridge|pg||
nt|caitlin: we start back in 25 minutes|pg||
nt|mariner1: lovers worldwide!|pg||
nt|mariner1: 35 minutes|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: 45 restart|pg||
nt|caitlin: 25 to 35 to 45 do I hear 55?|pg||
nt|caitlin: going once, twice, GONE|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: 12.45 is restart|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: 12.07 now|pg||
nt|mariner1: 34 minutes from now :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: though my clock has 11 after :)|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ahollan1: NICE PLAY BILL|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ahollan1: playing transfer advances - west could show his @H suit + @S tolerance|pg||
nt|kareno: I think that hand finished him, frankly.|pg||
nt|ritong: must be some curse|pg||
nt|mrdct: 4@d might have been asking for a specific card with 4NT saying he has it and someting else|pg||
nt|shevek: 4@d must be kickback|pg||
nt|jrssd: now a trump lead will force declarer to take the Club finesse|pg||
pc|d3|nt|jrssd: some lead|pg||
nt|shevek: he might survive the lead|pg||
nt|mrdct: east will know north has a singleton @S|pg||
nt|jrssd: he won't like it, but he'll have to take the Club finesse|pg||
nt|mrdct: clearly the best line so i'm sure matt mcmanus will bring this home|pg||
nt|shevek: I can't see any other options|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|hausigel: (in case North drops the 9 or 10 on first round)|pg||
mc|8|nt|mdgraham: practical|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: E-W pair are european champion in open teams|pg||

nt|vugrapha4: Hi all|pg||
nt|shevek: funny NS didn't find their @s fit in the other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: votes coming in -- 2@H much better bid than 1N|pg||
nt|mrdct: they found it here|pg||
mb|1D|nt|mariner1: wonder if any playing Moscito here|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: its adam doing the vugraph|pg||
nt|santyclz: Too good for 4@s?|pg||
mb|2C|nt|mariner1: 2@S Muiderberg/Tartan style|pg||
nt|phycodurus: yes, although maybe do it anyway|pg||
nt|jrssd: yes, surprising by North in other room|pg||
nt|mrdct: 3@s correctable i guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@S = 5+@S & 4+ minor|pg||
nt|ahollan1: very strong hand for that action when green [not vul vs vul]|pg||
nt|mariner1: 5@C the safe NS spot|pg||
nt|caitlin: if you want to watch another vugraph same time www.bbotv.com/vurgraph/ some need flash 9 most don't|pg||
nt|kennet: 4 spades here on the layout|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|hausigel: thank God North was dealer. I was just wondering if South would open 1@S here :)|pg||
nt|jrssd: this may push Wesnt into the auction|pg||
nt|mdgraham: do we know how many baords in each segment?|pg||
mb|d|nt|caitlin: transfer|pg||
nt|mariner1: 1@H must be transfer to @S|pg||
nt|caitlin: which South does not have to accept|pg||
nt|phycodurus: if you play fit showing jumpos it;s better, you don;t have to guess which suit to splinter in|pg||
nt|ritong: crunch looks brutal|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: 10X2|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mariner1: N does have a pretty good hand especially NV vs VUL|pg||
nt|mariner1: phantom save here, though reasonable|pg||
nt|chick: 5@H did its work|pg||
nt|mariner1: N afraid there are no @S tricks|pg||
nt|chick: which side is saving?  both are bidding to make :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: 5 @S does not make|pg||
nt|chick: I know, but they don't|pg||
nt|mariner1: 5 @H does not make|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a minor lead|pg||
nt|mariner1: Hi Shirley and all :)|pg||

nt|vugrapha4: hi all pls enjoy ... |pg||
nt|mariner1: ty Adam :)|pg||

nt|vugrapha4: e/w acol and n/s standard|pg||
nt|shevek: oops|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: so 2@H confirms a reverse type hand I would guess|pg||
nt|sybarra: hmm,  this might now make |pg||
nt|sybarra: W hoping for  slightly better @D's no doubt|pg||
nt|sybarra: *might not |pg||
nt|johnnybear: yes, although it seems highly likely the same contract will be played in the other room.|pg||
nt|itinerant: heh|pg||
nt|ritong: right|pg||
nt|johnnybear: although West might double 1@c, and East compete to 2@s|pg||
nt|ritong: possibly 2@d, a make too|pg||
nt|jrssd: with Clubs so perfect I don't thk they can beat this|pg||

nt|mdgraham: ty|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mariner1: does 1@C show @c's is an issue maybe|pg||
nt|ritong: or that, yes|pg||
nt|werge: 3 NT - come oon|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: agreed Al|pg||
nt|caitlin: not necessarily when pd has spades ,,,may not want to reverse|pg||
nt|mariner1: with that dbl in auction 2@H shows a big hand|pg||
nt|caitlin: sure|pg||
nt|kennet: finally some luck for N/S:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: and why didn't south raise to 3@S?|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think 4 @d|pg||
nt|shevek: always dangerous to dbl with a void...|pg||
nt|jrssd: a continuing theme, the void in competition|pg||
nt|shevek: so Dave , did you order 5 of those?|pg||
nt|jrssd: lol|pg||
nt|mrdct: despite risking conceding an overtrick, a @c continuation here might be the defences best chance|pg||
nt|jrssd: I vote for Dia as best|pg||
nt|shevek: Ish knows this contract will make|pg||
nt|mrdct: 3 rounds of @h will force decalrer to ruff with the @SJ to make|pg||
nt|shevek: dummy is a horrible sight|pg||
nt|shevek: and he knows north has @cKQxxx|pg||
nt|jrssd: I'm pretty sure Matt knows the trumps are 4-0|pg||
nt|shevek: @cJ can only be top of a short suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|phycodurus: must be tempting|pg||
nt|bridge_one: all you bid 2@C with South , not Dbl ?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: close either way|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mariner1: well 2N is not the optimum spot.......|pg||
nt|caitlin: wow|pg||
nt|werge: D for sure|pg||
nt|april7: X is much better|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d8|nt|ahollan1: lost opportunity -- south gave opponents free run|pg||
nt|mariner1: so the @S out should get this one q|pg||
nt|mariner1: quick|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4 @H not right by W|pg||
nt|phycodurus: to redouble,surely parner has 1 ace, can't be more than 1 down in your worst nightmare|pg||
nt|t 2: do you really want to XX when they can/will bid 5h?|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: ty|pg||
nt|werge: In fact 6 @c is not so bad - put @C´ 2-2 and it is easy play|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|santyclz: My problem with xx is I have no assurance of beating 5@h.|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ritong: penalty double of 1@c|pg||
nt|itinerant: NS in the other room use transfer responses to 1C with 1NT showing diamonds|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: still +50|pg||
nt|phycodurus: I'm shortsighted - see money, pick it up|pg||
nt|mrdct: ish has tricked declarer into tapping his dummy|pg||
nt|werge: Yoy make your living from Easts suit...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East knows his fate|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|mariner1: that made?|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: no, sorry, misclick|pg||
nt|chick: score is corrected to -1 now|pg||
nt|mariner1: he can drop the @S, or hook into S but not into N to make|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c2|pc|c6|nt|ahollan1: or +100 if vulnerability counts |pg||
nt|mariner1: N can get a ruff|pg||
nt|phycodurus: Do yoouthink Delm Monte will take NS word over his own judgement?|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|shevek: good move, but Mat will make this|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mrdct: now can trump coup east|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ritong: nunn is seeing some throw in coming|pg||
nt|itinerant: I don't think he's yet figured out who has the CA|pg||
nt|itinerant: I don't think EW play smith echoes so the only clue is that @c2|pg||
nt|johnnybear: yes, his black holdings are looking rather similar, and declarer will have one of the two aces|pg||
nt|itinerant: @h2|pg||
nt|itinerant: rather|pg||
nt|itinerant: Hans dropped it on the 2nd round of hearts|pg||
nt|ritong: anyways, the fact that he has a big problem underlines excellent table manners from his part|pg||
nt|jrssd: u were rt Dave, the club return|pg||
pc|cK|pc|d3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ok - i'll stick to analyzing bids |pg||
nt|t 2: haha its green running i would be worried about i think|pg||
pc|c7|pc|s8|nt|jrssd: but now a Heart goes away|pg||
pc|c9|nt|shevek: drawing trumps with @cKQ, nice|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|mariner1: so much for the ruff|pg||
pc|cA|nt|itinerant: well done nunn!|pg||
pc|h2|pc|s3|pc|hT|pg||
nt|mrdct: Milne team not lying down just yet|pg||
nt|shevek: wd Mat|pg||
nt|jrssd: perhaps 5 not needed, this counts as 1.5|pg||
nt|shevek: :)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|april7: ace of @H and finesse in @S and @H Q|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hA|nt|ritong: break time?|pg||
nt|itinerant: could well be|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: yes just having a drinks break |pg||
nt|itinerant: no smokers at this table|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|caitlin: operator there is question mark by 2NT... is that North's or yours?:))|pg||
nt|mariner1: we are plaing 16 boards it seems with both rooms starting in middle|pg||
nt|mariner1: playing|pg||
nt|caitlin: not a strong start|pg||
nt|caitlin: yes|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sT|pc|sQ|nt|jrssd: nice play, transferring the ruffs to Hearts|pg||
nt|shevek: Ish knows now every single card|pg||
nt|jrssd: so does Matt :)|pg||
nt|shevek: I wouldn't be surprised if he'd concede|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 6@S  MIGHT have shown prefernce for @C  [lowest outstanding spot card]|pg||
nt|caitlin: heart partial by E-W with hearts breaking badly|pg||
nt|mariner1: only part scores here|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: n\s playing standard with  transfer after 1c|pg||
nt|caitlin: or clubs by N-S|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS could compete to 3@C|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: east\west playing part polish club|pg||
nt|caitlin: ty Adam...what was alert on 2N on last hand?|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/  for BBO-TV. Watch many vugraph rooms at the|pg||
nt|mariner1: same time, even while playing or in the lobby. No download needed. Some need|pg||
nt|mariner1: Flash Player 9, some don't, Open one browser window per table|pg||
nt|sybarra: must say,  East pattern is no my favo for NT on last hand|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: and we are back |pg||
nt|april7: nicely handeled|pg||
nt|april7: 4@H and also 3NT on good breaks|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: I don't know the players.  How much bigger than Green is d|pg||
nt|johnnybear: what was the 1NT opening, Ed, for crunch?|pg||
nt|santyclz: 11-14|pg||
nt|itinerant: options|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: yes an I would denied the A@D play too,,,, to get a @c|pg||
nt|kennet: 5C again|pg||
nt|t 2: lol|pg||
nt|itinerant: 1H = 7-10 any|pg||
mb|2N|nt|ahollan1: NS plus on 7 out of 9 boards -- EW probaly exhausted|pg||
nt|mariner1: part scores here,,,,,,|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@S transfer pre-empt|pg||
nt|vugrapha4: dont know sr just getting used to this|pg||
nt|shevek: 3@d looks normal, so 1NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|caitlin: np:))|pg||
nt|mariner1: so we know NS like to play a lot of transfer bids........|pg||
nt|mariner1: systemic probably only bid he had|pg||
nt|santyclz: el'monte?|pg||
nt|jrssd: they now have to avoid "the god complex" - we can do anything!|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|t 2: on the hand theyd probably both sit it|pg||
nt|itinerant: to be fair, it's a pretty revolting 11|pg||
nt|shevek: comic?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: can NS make a game here? can they even get in?|pg||
nt|mariner1: 1@H is positive response, could be two way meaning?|pg||
nt|ritong: max with good fit, he should raise|pg||
nt|ritong: one way or another|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3NT on bad breaks, as well|pg||
mb|3H|nt|caitlin: two hands; two transfers|pg||
nt|johnnybear: perhaps via 2NT to make sure North doesn't bid any more?|pg||
nt|ritong: ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: will make now, a @c ruff was needed to defeat|pg||
nt|mariner1: so EW might not be in the auction here|pg||
nt|itinerant: 4S involves finessing twice in diamonds and once in spades, no entries to the dummy!|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ritong: i would understand 2 NT like " if you bid 3 NT i m happy"|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: how many weak notrumpers would open East with 1N?|pg||
nt|mariner1: looks like @S lead would squash NS hopes|pg||
nt|jrssd: hard for either player to bid anymore here|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: Nice 4@s from Fuller|pg||
nt|mariner1: E keeps them honest|pg||
nt|sybarra: looks like we can throw cards agst. wall and make 5 |pg||
nt|johnnybear: many play 2NT in auctions like this as artificial, forcing 3@c from partner|pg||
nt|johnnybear: I assumed this was the case after the alert, but I'm not sure|pg||
nt|ritong: but of course, different countries different treatments|pg||
nt|ritong: ya ok|pg||
nt|shevek: pity EW in OR bid too much|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: so we will never know|pg||
nt|chick: overboard |pg||
nt|mariner1: N needs to pass,,,,,, can't rely on a set here|pg||
nt|johnnybear: either way, they have done reasonably well, and 3@s looks awkward at best|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sT|nt|mariner1: 2@C meant as a @c raise I think,,,,,,,|pg||
nt|kennet: Team Horwitz won this event last year , Gill and green were on that team with Zmud Balic @@ Peake|pg||
nt|jrssd: ouch, just saw that - they were trying to get all the IMPs back themselves|pg||
pc|sK|nt|chick: @d raise|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@C meant as a @D raise oops|pg||
nt|mariner1: @D is the key suit here..... NS can't lead it|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|april7: 11 tricks  only|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d4|nt|jrssd: it really went down 3?|pg||
nt|shevek: well, they don't know what's going on at this table, do they|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d2|pg||
nt|mariner1: (oops on me)|pg||
nt|mariner1: nor can they give up a sluff ruff on @c|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes no issues here|pg||
nt|kennet: another fast board here|pg||
nt|hausigel: should be. 1 @D and 1 @S out|pg||
pc|d8|nt|mariner1: might as well be off 2 in 4,,,,,|pg||
nt|mariner1: which they did|pg||
nt|mariner1: the 8@H in N with S's having 9@H could come into play|pg||
pc|d3|nt|chick: you don't ooops too often, Rob :)|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d7|pg||
nt|itinerant: two diamonds to lose now|pg||
nt|johnnybear: It seems Nunn is playing for 3 diamond tricks after drawing trumps, but he will be disappointed|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d9|nt|mariner1: more often than I like though :)|pg||
nt|itinerant: to go with two clubs and a heart|pg||
nt|jrssd: yes, the defense got a crossruff going|pg||
pc|dT|nt|sybarra: hmmm or 6 |pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well 1@D worked out much better than my weak NT would have :(|pg||
nt|phycodurus: a bit of a waste of a nice duck by South|pg||
nt|phycodurus: not that it matters particularlt|pg||
nt|shevek: 9 imps to Horwitz|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mariner1: you don't ge get rich letting the O's play unmolested at the 2 level.... though|pg||
nt|mariner1: sometimes it avoids danger..........|pg||
pc|s7|pc|c3|pc|hT|pg||
