nt|mariner1: Marita Roberg is our super operator, Hi Marita!|pg||
nt|vugraphzdu: hi :)|pg||
nt|cindy: and E opened in 3rd seat|pg||
nt|cindy: it could be your hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzdu: http://www.bk2000.org/live/|pg||
nt|daman: 3@C was a feeble bid in fron of an unpassed partner|pg||
nt|daman: took him out of the equation|pg||
nt|chick: must be a goulash dealer they have over there :)|pg||
nt|granguru: Here everyone has his own suit...some better than others|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I expect 4@S - which given my prediction record means they will play something else entirely|pg||
nt|werge: But it was a very BIG 2 @S |pg||
mb|1H|nt|ralfwil: I think it´s enough to bid 4@s or 5@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: should have thrown  A 1h THEN n IS DOWN|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mdgraham: gl Marita|pg||
nt|frankaus: agree |pg||
nt|mcphee: yes @H discard|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: anyone for 1@S in third? |pg||
nt|mcarroll: and as usual @S wins|pg||
nt|chick: how many for 4@S?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|granguru: I for 5@S|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I wonder why N did not open his strong bid with 9 tricks?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: not me at imps|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx!|pg||
nt|vugraphzdu: :)|pg||
nt|april7: 3NT |pg||
nt|april7: 3@H |pg||
nt|mcphee: that is quite the 2@H raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: obeying the law|pg||
nt|spooky: do NS play 4crd Major?|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: if its our hand, partner will bid again over 1@S|pg||
nt|werge: It seems to be that|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cQ|nt|mcphee: lots would treat the S hand as a limit raise|pg||
nt|josj: they nicely avoided game here|pg||
pc|c2|nt|cindy: thats true also|pg||
nt|cindy: but i would rather get my bid in at a low level|pg||
nt|cindy: rather than guessing at a higher level|pg||
nt|daman: quite the auction in the other room|pg||
nt|mcarroll: David mentioned that this pair are imaginative bidders - this seems like a good example|pg||
nt|granguru: Looks like no one will be in 6@S as in the OR|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|mariner1: if I had A or KQs maybe|pg||
nt|josj: as they did in OR, yes|pg||
nt|chick: I don't understand the 3N bid, can't imagine wanting to play in 3N with an exposed Kx and a solid 8 card suit|pg||
pc|s4|nt|yo_yo: can East cuebid @S?|pg||
pc|s8|nt|april7: thats a good idea because 3NT might go down on @C lead|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that link is for 2008 operator|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mdgraham: I'm not such a good cardholder as you, Rob - I have to make do with queens and jacks|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://nbfdata.bridge.no/Turnering/default.asp?Fil=2009div1   for standing after round 5|pg||
nt|sybarra: www.bk2000.org/live/teams.aspx  for running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|april7: N loses only 1 @S and 2 @C, but careful now|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The competition started in November, Kath|pg||
nt|april7: should play Q|pg||
nt|Walddk4: This is the second weekend of 2|pg||
nt|yo_yo: got it now ty|pg||
nt|sybarra: we did the Nov. beginning |pg||
nt|sybarra: rounds|pg||
nt|yo_yo: my norwegian is not so good|pg||
nt|sybarra: mine is non-existent |pg||
nt|yo_yo: luckily most norwegians speak english|pg||
nt|april7: N has to rely on ace of @C with E and >K of @H also with E|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Flatt doesnt know it but everything sitting well for him|pg||
nt|mcphee: once S bids a simple 2@H game was well out of the photo|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|patricck: who would have balanced with a takeout double on the West hand?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|frankaus: 5@H usually a trump quality ask - - bid 6 with good trumps|pg||
pc|hK|nt|josj: well, 4@H certainly has play but not today|pg||
nt|april7: early @C promotion for @S discard necessary|pg||
nt|mcarroll: not me|pg||
nt|spooky: I wouldnt with a dbl|pg||
pc|h4|nt|yo_yo: East made it easier in the OR by jumping to 3@H|pg||
nt|yo_yo: even so  7 is a tremendous bid|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Helge is hoping nothing splits|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|mariner1: well if I open a lead director I usually really want the lead.......|pg||
pc|d4|nt|yo_yo: hoping the @C finesse is wrong|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|nt|mdgraham: time for clubs now |pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|d2|nt|granguru: After opponents @H overcall is very easy to get a @H lead..Specially if you are very short on the suit..|pg||
pc|d7|nt|chick: whoever bid 7 must have been hoping EVERYTHING split :)|pg||
nt|april7: should have played @C before, now no entry to hand|pg||
nt|mcphee: yes, prior to cashing the K@H|pg||
nt|josj: still tired from previous board|pg||
nt|mcphee: :)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|april7: I know that we all can invite,but giving another rais with 4 hearts is good bridge|pg||

pc|d8|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dK|pc|d5|pc|d9|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sQ|nt|april7: since W gets the trump trick, N discards a @C loser on @D Q|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Maybe we should give our foreigners some    å å å å å å å å å|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and  ø ø ø ø ø ø ø|pg||
nt|granguru: And ocasionally you may not have 4@S|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|pg||
nt|mcphee: Tondel had a clear 3@H raise as you point out|pg||
mc|8|nt|mcarroll: In fact W passed throughout and reopened with IMOa brave 3@C when 2@S came round to him|pg||

nt|cicus: hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our operator is Marita|pg||
nt|patricck: surely it falls it would be obligatory at matchpoints....and at least an option not vul at teams....would be very important here when NS made 8 tricks|pg||
nt|ralfwil: For me a double in  first position , not after 2@s|pg||
nt|werge: 9 major-tricks against 1 NT X in OR - but they did not get them|pg||
nt|spooky: I would just pass the complete hand.. and I am a junior.. hmmm...|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: maybe playing a club at trick 2 was better |pg||
nt|mariner1: anyone know if there is a results or updates link? I don't speak Norwegian.........|pg||
nt|mcphee: Lindqvist  will be very pleased to see he has no lost imps that last hand|pg||
mb|1S|nt|yo_yo: now is that a 12-14  NT or a 15-17?|pg||
nt|chick: 14-16? :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 13-15|pg||
nt|Walddk4: They play Precision|pg||
nt|yo_yo: we got there :)|pg||
nt|ady: 2@H   about the limit   but n/s  can make 3@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: i see the a in Flatt has one of those symbols|pg||
mb|1N|nt|mariner1: 4@H sure seems like it has play here|pg||
nt|cicus: surely the bidding went otherwise, still the contract is ok|pg||
nt|geot: Hi all:)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: good morning Gabor and Geo|pg||
nt|Walddk4: yes, operator catching up|pg||
nt|vugraphzdu: sorry. we had a bit of problem here. ok now i think :)|pg||
nt|cicus: hello Marita, Geo, Ronald, Ralf|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You can take 7@C to your bank managers and get a big loan|pg||
nt|josj: well, he lost his gain, didn't he?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: south may bid too high|pg||
nt|spooky: South lead a club against 1N in other room..|pg||
nt|patricck: a big difference on the opening lead in the other room J@C was 180 E/W, perfect defence on amajor lead could have been 500 N/S|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|yo_yo: roland hears everything!|pg||
nt|frankaus: XX will some rescue mechanism|pg||
nt|cicus: as can be seen, a laydown 6@C has been missed|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and  Høyland|pg||
nt|mcphee: quiqte true|pg||
nt|lestergold: well this looks like another reasonable major suit game which is unlikely to make as cards lie|pg||
nt|daman: will South take the plunge to 4@S? red?|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: according to the principle that, in general, bridge matches are lost rather than won|pg||
nt|lestergold: mind u not a compulsory 4s- if they bid conservatively opportunity for a gain|pg||
nt|lestergold: but they havent|pg||
nt|april7: its a vulnerable game so its ok|pg||
nt|lestergold: south knows his k of cl;ubs isno l;ooking like a good card but north sees a singleton club and likes his hand|pg||
nt|mcphee: perfectly normal 4@S|pg||
nt|josj: nice gadget to make S declarer|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|yo_yo: yes|pg||
nt|april7: S might not have a perfest opener|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: guess its tough to handle trumps and @c with only one entry in dummy|pg||
nt|mdgraham: practical 4@H bid|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://nbfdata.bridge.no/Turnering/default.asp?Fil=2009div1    results (I think)|pg||
nt|april7: 12 tricks in NT but 13 in @C|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 13 in NT too|pg||
nt|Walddk4: South is squeezed in spades and diamonds|pg||
nt|april7: @D finesse :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: No finesse|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: At least they escaped the double|pg||
mb|2H|nt|april7: I see only 12|pg||
nt|mcphee: a lot rests on what he plays now|pg||
nt|april7: but the 10,s make up for 4,3,3,3 and only 12 points|pg||
nt|lestergold: on a good day u lose a spade club and a dim but no today to coin a phrase|pg||
nt|granguru: N needs only the @SA in dummy fo make 4@s. U nfortunatelly dummy is worthless|pg||
mb|p|nt|granguru: The favourable lead is not enough...|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: The squeeze is automatic, Avram|pg||
nt|ady: try to sneak a diamond through|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes - if NS reversed their @H holding this lead would be very costly|pg||
nt|granguru: Declarer will probably play small @D to the @DQ now|pg||
mb|2S|nt|josj: lucky escape for W|pg||
nt|lestergold: a small dim would have been an inspired play|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|april7: @S/@D?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: yes|pg||
nt|ady: east will then be forced to try A@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: that might help - has the option of the spade finesse after discovering a trump losere|pg||
nt|chick: best bet is to play for 2-2 hearts and use the @S entry for finessing clubs|pg||
nt|yo_yo: roald might have regretted that bid had someone doubled|pg||
nt|frankaus: i dont think i want to be at the 3 level with Wests heap of ..........|pg||
nt|yo_yo: me neither|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i would be quaking at the 2 level|pg||
nt|chick: or 1NX|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: might try to give a @D ruff then there is a chance|pg||
nt|mcphee: he lead a low @D, there is not going to be any ruffs there|pg||
nt|lestergold: surely wil;l play club thru the dim can wait|pg||
nt|april7: 2 smaller 1d MISSING|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: maybe a catch up for  missing the slam|pg||
nt|spooky: for 500 it needed @HKJ @S to the 10?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|april7: but its nicer to be in 7@C,don't you think so?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mdgraham: you need two entries for that - jack, queen, king ace....need to get back to dummy to hook @C8 |pg||
nt|Walddk4: This is the most simple squeeze there is because it materialies automatically|pg||
nt|Walddk4: materialises  even|pg||
pc|h4|nt|sybarra: and with that lead in NT it would even be easier, just count to 13|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|lestergold: now declarer has to guess ht to avoi 2 off|pg||
nt|mcphee: now S is annoyed about the @D suit|pg||
nt|april7: 6 of @D lead was perfect, that betterr than top of nothing, 3/5 lead|pg||
nt|mcphee: I think he has things summed up and is steamed|pg||
nt|lestergold: but 6d lead was possibly the only lead to give contract ironically if north had played low reading it as not from an honour|pg||
nt|patricck: yes, very hard, 300 more likely than 500|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|spooky: aah I didnt see that @H10 is dropping so they can overtake @HJ if needed|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mdgraham: which, as it happens, does not work|pg||
nt|yo_yo: he just needs to check the @C are splitting|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c6|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hQ|pc|h3|nt|yo_yo: so now a @H ruff?|pg||
nt|patricck: K@S followed by spade to 10 then A@S back to K@H to cash 4th spade and then overtake souths 2nd heart to run the hearts also a possible way to get 500|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|mdgraham: however declarer has guessed hearts correctly|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d8|pc|d5|nt|mcphee: i would also have played Q|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|lestergold: an unneceesary contribution to the defence coffers|pg||
pc|h8|nt|yo_yo: and bobs your uncle|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mdgraham: and is now, it must be said, quite well placed|pg||

nt|mariner1: NS in open found their 4 3 and not the 5 3|pg||
nt|mariner1: S passed in Open?|pg||
nt|chick: and they win 2 imps on that|pg||
nt|yo_yo: so well done there to both teams|pg||
nt|lestergold: q hearets ofdds on with east why play misere|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: hmm, we've already caught up with the open room|pg||
nt|granguru: 3N EW here|pg||
mb|1D|nt|mariner1: so the 2@H shown was just the final contract... not the auction|pg||
nt|chick: It may be that these hands were played before the vugraph opened, and they just put the final contract in|pg||
nt|Walddk4: They are brothers, Helge and Roald|pg||
nt|yo_yo: do we like 1NT with a good 6 card minor?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i dont|pg||
nt|sybarra: no|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|geot: One spectator say he has seen them always, but to be excact...we are talking of the 1970's...not 18:)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I played against them in 1975. Just goes to show how old I am :(|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Beautiful, like poetry in motion|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 3NT comes in for e/w with nice club position|pg||
mb|2C|nt|yo_yo: East is let off the hook|pg||
nt|geot: I also played ag them those days, Roland....hm:(|pg||
nt|cicus: you could do that as a child Roland|pg||
nt|april7: N is not fooling around!|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: do we know what 2@C is?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: majors|pg||
nt|april7: probably majors|pg||
nt|vugraphzdu: both majors|pg||
nt|granguru: 3@C will catapult 3N from E|pg||
nt|granguru: Lebensohl|pg||
nt|patricck: would be easy for East to get overexcited here|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|mariner1: 2@S good call, known likely to be tapped in @D bid the length|pg||
nt|cindy: you dont think he had his bid ?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 1@s? why not 1nt?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: S should realize H has 5 spades here and does|pg||
nt|ady: 2NT obviously for minors     east might chance 3NT with some extra values|pg||
mb|3D|nt|yo_yo: double for me shows the other 2 suits|pg||
nt|frankaus: i'm with kath|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4s only one maybe 2 off at most|pg||
nt|mcphee: n/s missing a fine save|pg||
nt|april7: lucky 4 @S in open to gain imps|pg||
nt|lestergold: how they got into bidding in open room?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: EW can make 4@D and W bids it|pg||
nt|chick: which he had, sort of :)|pg||
nt|cindy: its too good for 1N|pg||
nt|cindy: and 1N may be conventional for them|pg||
nt|yo_yo: not good enough, you see what happened in OR|pg||
nt|cindy: just because they got a bad result, doesnt mean 1N isnt the correct bid|pg||
nt|josj: S opened, of course :)|pg||
mb|3S|nt|frankaus: 4333 opps in a live auction - its a accident waiting to happen to X|pg||
nt|geot: 1@H is the relay, or a natural response in Grøtheims Relay precision|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: 1NT probably stronger|pg||
nt|april7: I don't know, but lets see|pg||
nt|mcphee: the S hand opened 1@D in first seat|pg||
nt|april7: N bid 1 @S on 4 cards and S raised to game|pg||
nt|lestergold: well the dim opener worked well on this occasion|pg||
nt|mcphee: not the worst of openings at these colors|pg||
nt|josj: yes, it quickly located the double fit|pg||
nt|april7: @D opener on 9 points?|pg||
nt|mcphee: for any pair using a strong @C system opening 1@D kinda routine|pg||
mb|3N|nt|yo_yo: i use that bid myself, but always in fear in trepidation|pg||
nt|cindy: oh please|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Results after round 6: http://nbfdata.bridge.no/Turnering/Default.asp?Fil=2009div1|pg||
nt|josj: 6-4, @S, green v. red...|pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: if not hearts, N must have a game going hand to respond 1@H|pg||
nt|spooky: West will show his minimum all the time so they wont get to high is my prediction|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|lestergold: bold certainly but these 9 counts are often more powerful than 4333 12 counts|pg||
nt|patricck: thats what SHOULD happen, but always easier looking at all 4 hands.... East has a very nice spade suit|pg||
nt|werge: Now 4 @S should end the auction|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Now how does W put the brakes on?|pg||
nt|werge: It is difficult - 4 @h touches West|pg||
nt|spooky: what is 4@H exactly?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|mcphee: he does have 6-4 and a hand that cvan be shut out of the bidding|pg||
nt|ady: maybe 2NT was showing can play in 2 suits |pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: east will be pleased in a moment|pg||
mb|4N|nt|werge: Cue with selfmade @s|pg||
nt|mcarroll: In this auction is $NT now natural orKCB?|pg||
nt|spooky: and what would 4@C/@D be?|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: as they proved at our table :)|pg||
nt|april7: but its generally looking for trouble|pg||
nt|ady: sorry west playing|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 4NT!|pg||
mb|5C|nt|yo_yo: i used to be forbidden to make that 1NT overcall and here's why|pg||
nt|lestergold: he has an ace and a king for defence and has 4 spades and a nice 6 card suit sometimes i think we pay tyoo much attentionm to point counts|pg||
nt|april7: don't argue with success:):):)|pg||
nt|patricck: if the K@C was onside 6@S would be a reasonable shot with setting up the diamonds, so although slam is less than 50% it is probably harsh to be too critical of getting overboard|pg||
mb|p|mb|6S|mb|p|nt|mcarroll: All roads seem to lead to 10 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: I'd certainly never pass that hand, and 1N vs X depends on agreement of 1N bid.|pg||
mb|p|nt|werge: @D 3-3 with the Ace on-side would do, I think|pg||
nt|ralfwil: What lead should you prefer as S?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Switch the @CA and @DK and slam a much better proposition|pg||
pc|dA|nt|werge: Normally I would lead a trump|pg||
nt|patricck: 10@C lead for me on this auction...one of the few times I get the lead right  :)|pg||
nt|spooky: I would try a @S|pg||
pc|d2|nt|cindy: that would just make me bid it more|pg||
pc|d9|nt|mariner1: 2 2 @D means easy line here|pg||
nt|chick: if 1N is sandwich, then X is the only choice I can see|pg||
nt|cindy: thats right|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @dA was the last for me|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|werge: One more @D..|pg||
nt|patricck: makes on a heart witch too|pg||
nt|spooky: needs a black now to beat?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: S knows that E has the A of @h, so a @c switch is obvious|pg||
nt|werge: Then odds are bad - South has twice as many reds as black ones|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If E has @cK there is no defence|pg||
nt|werge: And if North has a singletin @D...?|pg||
nt|patricck: then he will have something to say when you switch to a black suit!!|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s2|pc|s7|nt|werge: South also has the vugraph-problem - continu @D and we all say: WHAT a lead...|pg||

nt|mdgraham: probably 1@H-1@s-splinter? |pg||
nt|cicus: 6@D seems best here|pg||
nt|april7: thats 4@S making 5 or 6|pg||
nt|mcphee: will have to have someone do a ZAR count for that hand|pg||
nt|daman: now 4@S for NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: that was how Open bid it|pg||
nt|cindy: well   there it may be true|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a nice 6@d? |pg||
nt|geot: Nice slam here, 6@D is almost lay down if diamonds are 3-2. Not reached in the OR|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: but here you have meckwell stealing from you all the time|pg||
nt|daman: pretty straightforwars even with the bad trump break|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: it can be useful to have the agreement that, when you splinter as opener, your first suit is really good |pg||
nt|cicus: although 6NT is on but...|pg||
nt|april7: has to guess @S 10 for 12 tricks|pg||
nt|mcphee: ZAR points is a way of counting the values of your hand a little differently|pg||
nt|spooky: easy 4@H here.. |pg||
mb|3D!|nt|yo_yo: so in spite of missing a grand slam  Vest agder go into the lead|pg||
nt|cindy: teaches you real fast not to be a coward|pg||
nt|april7: an "easy" 3NT by N|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes looks pretty standard|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: very true Mike.........|pg||
nt|geot: 1NT is forcing, may be start of relays, which it is this time|pg||
nt|josj: nice 3nt here|pg||
nt|lestergold: now here we have an example of exactly the kind of yucky 12 count i am talking about|pg||
mb|3H|nt|cicus: 1NT is FG relay|pg||
nt|mcphee: the last hand was about 27 zar points, which qualifies as an opening bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: are these names regions of Norway, looks like it|pg||
nt|april7: now there is  a problem|pg||
nt|april7: lucky for E that ace of @D with S|pg||
nt|sybarra: thinking the same |pg||
nt|ady: looks like a routine 4@S 10 or 11 tricks|pg||
mb|3N|nt|Walddk4: Grøtheim asking, Tundal showing|pg||
nt|mcphee: you can read about zar points online at his web site|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: we bid on flea tickets here  but not with 4333's|pg||
nt|ralfwil: what should 2@c from N mean?|pg||
nt|geot: Now relays. We can count on that N will show his distribution etc etc..and then I think Grøtheim will find out enough to bid 6@D|pg||
nt|patricck: yes, looks like it should be a flat board, but I've been wrong before......many times in fact  :)|pg||
mb|4H|nt|yo_yo: we say "tram" tickets|pg||
nt|cindy: well  here everyone bids aggressively so you have field protection|pg||
nt|cicus: no details in sysrtem card|pg||
nt|geot: I am not sure about 2@C, but I think a max hand|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I have an expert in the audience|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 2@H  min  not 6 hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 2@S relay|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 3@D  side suit in clubs|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I cannt understand the sys of NS, says a spectator. I don't blame him|pg||
nt|cicus: I would bid 3@H now :)|pg||
nt|geot: he he|pg||
nt|geot: I guess S will bid 3@H too, to find out the distribution in S+D|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The system allows them to pinpoint jacks if they like, aparat from shape, hcp concentration and controls|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Very sophusticated system|pg||
nt|Walddk4: We would all bid 7NT of course|pg||
nt|geot: Sorry specs, we cant explain good enough this bidding. It is more than 25 years since I played Precision, then with Grøtheim, when he started developing is good system|pg||
nt|geot: his good system.|pg||
nt|mcphee: give it a google|pg||
nt|april7: how come N passed 2@C?|pg||
nt|april7: X!!!|pg||
nt|josj: now S can X|pg||
nt|mcphee: what would you have bid?|pg||
nt|lestergold: unless they have a system in which reopening double does not promise extras, i would not be too impressed|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: yes - but @d do not run so has to rely on @S finesse|pg||
nt|april7: good judgement, E has no entries to the @S suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: hmm|pg||
nt|lestergold: and its only hundreds in this horrible contract with a nasty lie of the cards as well|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: so easy bidding in both rooms|pg||
nt|geot: looks  natural lol|pg||
pc|s8|nt|mdgraham: yes - a most honourable push|pg||
nt|yo_yo: opening bid + opening bid = game  thinks Ericksen|pg||
nt|vugraphzdu: test|pg||
pc|s3|nt|chick: and what's more, with the weakness in the unbid suit, inviting the lead|pg||
nt|mcarroll: They were a little more ambitious in Open - in 5@S|pg||
nt|april7: solves all problems|pg||
nt|lestergold: must lose 7 top tricks for a modest swing against them|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sK|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 3@D  2-5-2-4    4@D  Natural, slammish|pg||
pc|hA|nt|granguru: it is hard not to make 11 tricks|pg||
pc|h4|nt|josj: X seems logical but maybe I've been playing mp too much, of late|pg||
pc|h2|nt|geot: If S already knew the whole distribution he may go for 6@D, the superior contract. But 6@H, 6NT will make too|pg||
nt|Walddk4: He knew the shape after 3@D|pg||
nt|geot: wd, good bidding (I guess:))|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|mariner1: 5N likely shows the holding and the void|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@D could have been a stiff|pg||
pc|h7|nt|Walddk4: But he could have asked for more info with 3@H|pg||
nt|ralfwil: even 7nt on a squeeze or double finess in @s witn the lucky @h distribution. but of course the right contract|pg||
nt|geot: yes 6@D is a lovely contract|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hQ|nt|werge: ok|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|hK|nt|april7: S has a perfect reopening X, thats my opinion|pg||
nt|josj: mine as well|pg||
nt|josj: hej Hans|pg||
nt|lestergold: north hasnt doubled because he likes diamonds too much he cant be sure of not pushing them into a making major|pg||
pc|s4|pc|hT|nt|yo_yo: easy game bridge, thinks helge|pg||
nt|cicus: it seems the best line is to try and ruff a spade|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c2|nt|mariner1: ok to bypass 5 level as no way 3 controls and a solid @H suit would not be at least|pg||
nt|mariner1: good enough for 6|pg||
nt|cicus: even with 6-2 he will survive as west can only ruff at the cost of his trump trick|pg||
nt|lestergold: dont double low levekl contracts for penalties unless u are sure u can double their runner too|pg||
nt|april7: Thats true, but it is a reopening X by S|pg||
nt|lestergold: distinguished kibbuitzer has pointed out that 3n cold for n/s same nine tricks as 3cl! but whose bidding it?|pg||
nt|ady: flat|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cK|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s9|pc|s2|nt|mcphee: I was chatting about the same thing|pg||
nt|josj: if N does not pass 2@C initially, they will get there (as I suggested before)|pg||
nt|mcphee: N passed 2@C when some would try 2N|pg||
nt|april7: 1 more trick for E|pg||
nt|lestergold: well a perfectro making with the help of the club finesse|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
mc|11|nt|cicus: now S may be a bit nervous about trumps but all roads lead to heaven|pg||
nt|cicus: I think the percentage play is to finesse|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I cannot blaim ruffing a @s but it´s looks easier to draw thrumps and play on @h|pg||
nt|april7: K of @H and trump, finish|pg||
nt|spooky: +!?|pg||
nt|spooky: +1?|pg||
nt|patricck: hmm|pg||
nt|vugraphzdu: yes they say so|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|mariner1: 3N might have a better play if in S, no chance though|pg||

mb|2N|an|()|nt|ralfwil: with open cards 10 tricks in @s|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: fourth highest from longest works well here :)|pg||
nt|chick: I dunno, with 8 tricks in the red suits, only needs to get one black trick before EW get their 5, defense has to be excellent|pg||
nt|mcarroll: S may get too high very easily|pg||
nt|ady: poor vuln multi     will struggle in 2@S with a good hand opposite|pg||
mb|3S|nt|mariner1: the @H lead gives him some hope|pg||
nt|mcphee: ok more on Zar|pg||
nt|daman: awful bid|pg||
nt|werge: 3 @c|pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: A bit strange contract in CR, but quite natural even though they have 5-3 in spades, and a very strong 6-1 in hearts|pg||
nt|mcphee: you can locate in wikipedia|pg||
nt|lestergold: well slam is makeable here|pg||
nt|werge: Yes Ralf - but you must play against odds then - in @d|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: even a explorer search|pg||
nt|josj: easily enough with some help from the KGB|pg||
nt|april7: finally a slam on finding the Q of @H|pg||
nt|mcphee: E is pretty good here for this bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: Furunes rebid was 2D, and West made a reasonable pass|pg||
nt|chick: for those who don't play multi, 2@S shows better hearts|pg||
nt|granguru: Geir helgemo is forbidden to play for Norway for a year...thats why we do not see him with helness or any other|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Maybe S is familiar with pd's idea of a vulnerable Multi in 1st seat|pg||
nt|granguru: 2@D is probably a multi opening..one meaning is weak in a major|pg||
nt|granguru: He was suspended...|pg||
nt|ady: very weak|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mcphee: he wants to bid it|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes its a good slam because it maskes on eitehr a 3/3 dim break or finding the heart q which is well odds in favour as one often obtains a count or at least an inferential count ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: with so many high cards on hands like this|pg||
nt|april7: 6 controls |pg||
nt|april7: W will bid 6 NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: wants to correct this to 6N!|pg||
nt|april7: he should|pg||
nt|lestergold: knows pard has only three hearts|pg||
nt|april7: yes|pg||
nt|josj: 6@H plays itself|pg||
nt|mcphee: i would bid NT as W now as the @S layout might be problemsome with the lead going through @S values|pg||
nt|april7: might not be easy to locate Q of @H|pg||
nt|josj: complete crossruff, probably an overtrick|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes ironically the 4/3 fit makes even he doesnt find the heart q|pg||
nt|josj: very nice contract indeed :)|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sQ|nt|werge: OK - with the Doudle - 10 tricks look fair|pg||
nt|werge: Double|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|mariner1: Tor has a decision here|pg||
nt|chick: @D or @S|pg||
nt|mariner1: he will get one more chance though|pg||
nt|mcphee: yes, if this is the place it reasts|pg||
nt|daman: "How to embarrass yourself in front of 950 kibiyzers"|pg||
nt|ralfwil: just eleminating everything and play for @dJ by W|pg||
nt|werge: @D J AND Ace,pls|pg||
nt|mcarroll: For me this is closer to a 2@S than 1@S opening bid - but first ib hand vat red??|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lestergold: and 6N went off we see in open room|pg||
nt|josj: both black suits well-placed for crossruff purposes...|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mcphee: ok 6NT was perfectly reasonable|pg||
nt|lestergold: well an opportunity here for a big swing|pg||
nt|josj: but as expected, they can't believe how well they were bidding, actually :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: of course the dim break will reveal the dim length in niorth hand and it may not be eassy tio place north with 4 hearts as well|pg||
nt|mcphee: Barry Crane claims, playing the Q lies over the J|pg||
nt|lestergold: i can see how this must have failed|pg||

nt|mcarroll: in hand at red|pg||
nt|werge: Bad timing, better play @H before@C|pg||

nt|josj: maybe N missorted his hand...3@S and 5@C|pg||
nt|spooky: that it was a fast board :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzdu: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: mirror|pg||
nt|patricck: 6@C is a nice contract here|pg||
mb|1C|nt|cindy: thats ok    i keep long term statistics|pg||
nt|daman: some great hands so far|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: mirrored hands EW|pg||
nt|april7: might stay in 2NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: and very pretty on only one side of that mirror|pg||
mb|1S!|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|mariner1: DBL is support showing 3 @S|pg||
nt|mariner1: N should realize S has no wasted @H values,,, and maybe a stiff @H|pg||
nt|geot: 14-16|pg||
nt|daman: looks like NS will end up in 4@S|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree with 6@c!|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D!|nt|chick: opposite a decent 5 card spade suit, S has only 3 losers (hopefully no immediate club ruff)|pg||
nt|sybarra: 7 top tricks |pg||
nt|yo_yo: another flat hand    what's on tv?|pg||
nt|april7: 2NT - pass|pg||
nt|ady: will get to high      |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: news/weather?|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@D multi here showing big balanced hand|pg||
nt|mcphee: I can not imagine not reaching game|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2n cant be touched|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|daman: and will probably fail|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: i can why should west raise with a J|pg||
nt|werge: And slowly they need a slam-swing|pg||
nt|ralfwil: perhaps not so easy to find|pg||
nt|spooky: I think west showed 5@C's now, so east can set @C?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|josj: @CK gains in stature now|pg||
nt|daman: 3NT has a chance|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 4@S is no thing of beauty on thr defence of three rounds of hearts|pg||
nt|ralfwil: of course a @d favour|pg||
nt|april7: the only bid allowed to pass is 2NT=23-24|pg||
nt|mcphee: because you are playing IMPS|pg||
nt|mcarroll: But in 6@C surely you still need the @S to come in for no loser? |pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: natural|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well stayman with 2 4 card majors i suppose kis a risk some take|pg||
nt|mcphee: and game may easily make in a major or NT|pg||
nt|patricck: you can ruff the spades good in 6@C (unless they break 5-1)|pg||
nt|werge: 6@C is lay-down with trumps 3-2|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mariner1: yes however it can still make|pg||
nt|chick: yes, ok only because Kx@S onside|pg||
nt|chick: and 3-2 clubs so can get to dummy for a spade finesse|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Rogaland and Vest Agder are names of rwo of the counties in Norway (about 20 in total) located on the south and southwest coast of Norway |pg||
nt|mariner1: Tor not enthralled with his chances looking at dummy|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Rune Hauge sponsors the Rogaland team, but none of the players reside in that county|pg||
nt|mcphee: some days your partner has 5@D|pg||
nt|ady: easy lead |pg||
nt|werge: Wests hand is high - ruffing the 4th @D in dummy|pg||
nt|patricck: yes, as a spec pointed out to me, take 2 trumps and ruff the 4th diamond, no spades needed|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mcarroll: and football Kath|pg||
nt|april7: here we have an easy 8 trick , @H are blocked|pg||
nt|chick: they have to get their 3 club tricks immediately, otherwise one can go away on hearts|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|yo_yo: if only he could get to dummy|pg||
nt|frankaus: this maybe hard to make|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ah no, to his hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: easy on club lead|pg||
nt|yo_yo: not sure North will find K@C lead|pg||
nt|cindy: or club to the 9|pg||
nt|josj: it worked well here...on a @C lead, 4@H will make|pg||
nt|april7: 1down on normal defence|pg||
pc|c2|nt|chick: nice falsecard|pg||
nt|mariner1: Wojo pointing out that N needs the J@D to make this best defense, and of course N|pg||
nt|mariner1: has the J@D|pg||
nt|cindy: doest matter what they lead|pg||
nt|marlowepi: they ahve top lead SOMETHING. then how do they get 5 tricks?|pg||
nt|cindy: lolol|pg||
nt|cindy: i see an easy 9|pg||
nt|lestergold: irony here is that ten tricks would be there if west had the entries to make leads up|pg||
nt|mariner1: no entry W hurts|pg||
nt|josj: had E been declarer, it would have been a different story...|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cK|pc|c9|pg||
nt|lestergold: well draw trumps play three rounds of dims and defence have to play clubs or they can let it thru|pg||
pc|c4|nt|yo_yo: how's england doing , isnt it the test match?|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|mdgraham: no choices now - will certainly not play for singleton @SK offside |pg||
nt|sybarra: will he run the 10 fo @C?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mcarroll: Yes I obviously need a coffee refill|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I think that it s important to show Ws distribution to find 6@c|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mariner1: now he needs kx @S on side and 3 2 @c and that is what he has|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mcphee: E trumps were too strong!|pg||
nt|ady: needs Queen to save a trick|pg||
pc|c8|nt|marlowepi: don;t blame you for laughing at my typing. will try to keep my excitement under control|pg||
nt|sybarra: of low to the J? |pg||
nt|werge: Ar we allowed to say: Poor bidding at both tables?|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|april7: losing 1@C 1@D and 2 @S|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree Hans!|pg||
nt|werge: What was 2 NT?|pg||

mb|p|nt|yo_yo: when i make leads like that, partner has singleton K|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: yes, sorry|pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: South doubled over 1@D opening in CR, and West was able to bid 1@H, but not to win the 2@H contract. Chance for a double score for VA as 1NT seems difficult to win|pg||
nt|granguru: There si no entry in n hand for a @C ruff to be given|pg||

nt|patricck: good bidding at both tables this time....no more than we expected of course :)|pg||

nt|yo_yo: i think he'll show his 5 card major|pg||
nt|chick: I dunno, pard should have 4 spades, 3 at least, and might miss a vul game in spades|pg||
nt|chick: trade that off against how much you can set a 1 level bid|pg||
nt|geot: wd done South in the CR (Ann K Fuglestad) not to go to 4@S on this one|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 1N with 17 and 5 4 might not be my call here|pg||
nt|mcphee: now things should heat up a bit|pg||
nt|april7: 4@H 1 down|pg||
nt|chick: transfer to hearts will come as a surprise to S :)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Maybe they played too fast  |pg||
mb|2C!|nt|mariner1: 2@S showing @S and a minor?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: very diplomatic Rob, that use of the word "might"|pg||
nt|marlowepi: don;t know why partner has to have that many spades, nor do i have any desire to defend 1HX before i know if we have a grand slam|pg||
nt|cicus: I admit I'd be tempted to bid 4@S even over 1@H|pg||
nt|mariner1: 5@D makes here so the save worked|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Seems impossible to make 7?|pg||
nt|granguru: Helness said that he thought that 4@d would have been natural, i was told|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Rogaland in dire straits at this point. Helness in the second best league? That would sound impossible, would it not? But it may happen|pg||
nt|vugraphzdu: yes they did :)|pg||
mb|2D|nt|geot: the problem in defence is taht the clubs are blocked|pg||
nt|geot: so 4@S will make|pg||
nt|geot: West who has the trumps will follow diamonds after the spade A is played|pg||
nt|lestergold: well this is an  interesting one 5d looks on for e/w |pg||
mb|3S|nt|lestergold: but he penalty in 4h available as an alternative|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: does 4h have to go 2 off?|pg||
nt|josj: needs a @S lead by N to beat slam.|pg||
nt|lestergold: a loser in each suit - thats only one off but it went 2 off in open|pg||
nt|april7: @C discard on 4th @S, if @C trick is not developed|pg||
nt|mariner1: if declarer in @H carelessly pulls trumps then its off more than 1|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes east's hand is very slammish it certainly does not look profitabel to defend 4h with that hand|pg||
nt|mcphee: there may be 1 round of trumps, then panic |pg||
nt|april7: E might not stand for the X|pg||
nt|lestergold: and indeed hes no doubt in the tank|pg||
nt|mcphee: do not see how he can pull this dble|pg||
nt|lestergold: and north on lead would he find a spade?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: REDBL here asked for the minor I am sure|pg||
nt|yo_yo: South isnt finished|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S is finished i think|pg||
nt|chick: now he is|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: the heaqrt looks natural|pg||
nt|mcphee: he already stated his hand was offensive for @D|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mariner1: in Open W had bid 3N which guaranteed @H cards so E was assured of a set|pg||
pc|c3|nt|april7: I think the X was not well judged|pg||
nt|lestergold: striped tail|pg||
pc|c7|nt|chick: oops|pg||
nt|marlowepi: WOW-|pg||
nt|yo_yo: he does have an Ginormous hand|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I had not opened 4@h. for me it´s too strong|pg||
nt|geot: To set it west must have led a club, and overtake Easts C Q in the second trick, then give E a ruff for the singleton S5|pg||
nt|geot: setting trick would then have been the spade K. Now declarer will try the diamonds, but actually he dont need to, clubs are blocked|pg||
nt|josj: or it says: don't lead a heart...|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|mariner1: so 2@S showed C or the red suits|pg||
nt|chick: 4@S should have been fast arrival, don't you think?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3H = can you bid game?   4S = i guess i'll give it a shot    6S = OK, then let;'s play slam|pg||
nt|cindy: lol|pg||
nt|cindy: moving targets|pg||
nt|cindy: only 1 trick short on non trump lead  :o|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but just look at what a HUGE difference it would make if one of S's clubs were another spade. the 3-card trump length is a big negative|pg||
nt|cindy: yes|pg||
nt|chick: and a good reason not to try the slam|pg||
nt|cindy: N contributed with 2@s|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in all fairness, S probably thought he DID have four spades--after all, he made a takeout double|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Erichsen thinks he can count 12 tricks and I sympathize with that|pg||
nt|chick: perhaps next time, Furunes will opt for 1@HX :)|pg||
nt|cindy: would you bid 2@s with all those heart cards ?|pg||
nt|mcphee: i also think dble not so great|pg||
nt|april7: 5@D makes because of Jx in @C!!!|pg||
nt|mcphee: the lure of the singleton @C|pg||
nt|mariner1: even if jxx it makes|pg||
nt|josj: good lead, anyway; in that respect, the X worked well|pg||
nt|lestergold: double for lead not unreasonabloe south knows that only a spade is going to have a chance of denting this contract as it happens it cant be dented|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|yo_yo: another exciting 1NT|pg||
nt|spooky: South opened 3@D in the other room and West bid 3N.. that wasnt making|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|nt|yo_yo: i might bid 4|pg||
nt|chick: I would|pg||
nt|lestergold: in gweneral im in favour of doubling form leads with the attendant risks|pg||
nt|granguru: 7@H could have been made with a @h lead or after ruffing the 4th @S with a small @H|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|ady: re-hi all    had computer problem|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Austberg's dubious pre-empt worked well in the other room|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|nt|ralfwil: The @d can alsi be 3-3|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mdgraham: 5@Cx would have been interesting|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|mdgraham: think 500/800 depending on the defence|pg||
nt|april7: because of 10 and 9 of @C droping, 7 tricks only, on good defence though|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Who can blame J Høyland for overcalling 3NT? Seems normal|pg||
pc|c6|nt|mcphee: for sure Mike|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cT|nt|marlowepi: i am not sure what 12 tricks he would be counting. pd can have 4 spades|pg||
nt|chick: 2@S, not 4|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|cA|pc|s4|nt|mcphee: costs very little and often reqarding|pg||
nt|granguru: rehi David|pg||
nt|daman: re|pg||
nt|chick: now @CA and @C hoping for an endplay to avoid one of the @D losers|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|cindy: im not saying i would pass    i would bid 1@s|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i thought you said you were agressive!|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think 1S has a lot going for it--it is unlikely to end the auction|pg||
nt|cindy: only when its right|pg||
nt|cindy: those hearts cant be worth anything|pg||
nt|lestergold: indeed|pg||
nt|lestergold: we know as commentatiors how important the opening lead is|pg||
nt|mcphee: not that many folks redble, maybe that will change|pg||
nt|mcphee: door|pg||
nt|lestergold: east has an easy redouble probably didnt want them sabing in hearts - too cheap|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|patricck: seems a reasonable choice, I can see some people choosing 3@S, but put me down for an unsuccesful 3NT|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mariner1: told they play suction, or yeslek in Norway (Kelsey backwards)|pg||
pc|d5|nt|geot: this will give MT 9 imps and lead down to 9|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mcarroll: down 1 now|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|patricck: I can't believe Eide not opening with a diamond pre-empt|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s9|pc|sT|nt|marlowepi: i dont think cindy is being unaggressive with 1S. it is a calculated gamble. when W does not bid, chances are that S has a strong hand. bidding 1S lets S reveal the nature of that ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hand, and if partner does bid again there should be little problem getting to game, and alternative games can be explored|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|dA|pc|sJ|pc|d7|nt|granguru: in fact, per the Movie, declarer lead a @H toward dummy at trick 2 (@S lead; played by East) and South ducked...|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|c8|nt|yo_yo: well who knows how to bid freaks|pg||
nt|werge: He had two other suits for his choice - or for his partners|pg||
pc|d9|nt|lestergold: a seaty monment for east but he cant go wrong|pg||
nt|granguru: 4@s anyone here?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ady: hi all|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in my view, the more you tend to double on hands with only 3 spades, like that of S, the better a 1S response looks|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, kath, true enough|pg||
nt|yo_yo: we are quite relaxed over here about doubling with 3@S|pg||
nt|lestergold: sweaty i m,eant|pg||
nt|mariner1: well W didn't have to have A@H could have been kj @H and this is down too|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good evening to David Edwin|pg||
nt|mdgraham: hello David|pg||
nt|cindy: those goulash tournamens on here are always full for some reason   i hate em|pg||
nt|mcarroll: With a @S void I would preempt with the S hand|pg||
nt|werge: - and I would NEVER|pg||
pc|h9|nt|mariner1: hi David|pg||
nt|ady: hi Mike|pg||
nt|chick: Hi David :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: indeed|pg||
nt|april7: whats going on|pg||
pc|h2|nt|april7: W miscouted|pg||
nt|lestergold: this must be an error|pg||
nt|mariner1: did he just set himself?|pg||
nt|lestergold: he had on top the rest|pg||
nt|lestergold: what happened? someone enlighten us|pg||
nt|josj: he forgot to draw trumps, I assume|pg||
nt|mariner1: Marita was that off 2?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdu: He didnt se that J @C felt|pg||
nt|vugraphzdu: 2 down|pg||
nt|mariner1: ty Marita :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzdu: :)|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hK|pg||
nt|marlowepi: goulasch is great fun|pg||
nt|patricck: it's true you might catch partner with a void diamond and 6 hearts, but pre-empts are never guaranteed. Why did N/S lose imps on this board, because they pre-empted in the other ...|pg||

nt|chick: and 9 out of 10|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|geot: here|pg||
mb|2S|nt|yo_yo: what rebid now?|pg||
nt|chick: 2@H|pg||

nt|april7: bad breaks all over, |pg||

nt|mcphee: at least request a mulligan|pg||
nt|mariner1: Blinded by the Light?|pg||
nt|josj: it's dark up there anyway|pg||
nt|mariner1: @D lead kills 3N here|pg||
nt|april7: can't leave it, must bid 4@H|pg||
nt|ady: should hold to one|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: 2@H a bit low, 3@H a bit high|pg||
nt|april7: all should stay as low as possible, but E will go t at least 2@H|pg||
nt|patricck: It's also truen that 2nd seat vulnerable is the position with the strictest pre-empting requirements, but I would still be in on the one with a reasonable 7 card suit and a void|pg||
mb|2N|nt|frankaus: 3@S|pg||
nt|chick: 3N a lot high :)|pg||
nt|cindy: this hand is troublesome for me    good enough for 3@h but dont want to preempt the potential @s fit|pg||
nt|yo_yo: do we like 2@D?|pg||
nt|cindy: thats a thought|pg||
nt|chick: no, with a very weak hand, partner might pass 2@D|pg||
nt|cindy: but then maybe thats ok |pg||
nt|yo_yo: looks as if 3NT means something or other|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|mdgraham: no :)|pg||
nt|chick: guess not|pg||
nt|cindy: a spec tells me it shows 6 hearts and 3 spades   well thats what he has|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 2@D would help find the right game |pg||
nt|yo_yo: North has a near opener, he might bid on|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: Chick we have 2 more to play,,,,,,, bribe the dealer :)|pg||
nt|ady: hard to keep out of game   25 hcp|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East will have @SJ on the table so fast|pg||
nt|mdgraham: declarer will hold up for two rounds, but deep down he will know that it is hopeless |pg||
nt|chick: OK, for the next match, I predict interesting hands and big swings :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: he wont pass with 2 Aces and a King|pg||
nt|mcphee: sadly all games fail|pg||
nt|april7: inspite that lead 2 down|pg||
nt|mariner1: cards sitting not nice here|pg||
nt|granguru: already 8|pg||
nt|werge: In CR, N bis 2@S - may be they were droven til game then|pg||
nt|werge: But the @S Q should make the decision easy = 4 @H|pg||
nt|spooky: cant u lose 1 in each suit?|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: but S allways passed,what does he show|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 @C?|pg||
nt|april7: best contract till now|pg||
nt|april7: 1down only|pg||
nt|yo_yo: South is wishing he had passed now|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: a control bid from S|pg||
nt|sybarra: in US, we would open the S hand with 1 @D |pg||
nt|mcarroll: anyone transfer with this E hand?|pg||
nt|chick: I think +1|pg||
nt|ady: have done well to stay in 1NT    2 hearts might go down|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ralfwil: With a @h lead, declarer must play the @hA|pg||
nt|geot: Thats right. I think Tundal will play for one heart honor with E. But it is a heart guess anyway. Lets see...|pg||
nt|sybarra: with a nice rebid of 2 @C |pg||
nt|april7: good idea to have a easy rebid|pg||
nt|yo_yo: we wouldnt like that bid here|pg||
nt|werge: May be North started with 2 x @C|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|cindy: i kind of like that 3N agreement|pg||
nt|yo_yo: so do i|pg||
nt|cindy: 3 choices of places to play with one bid|pg||

pc|s6|pc|s5|pg||

nt|granguru: W looking for 9 tricks!|pg||
nt|spooky: in the other room they did|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mdgraham: ok, one round|pg||

pc|dA|nt|cindy: yes|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d3|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if West has @CA it is hopeless, so may as well play him for @CJ |pg||
nt|chick: but a fairly rare situation|pg||
nt|ady: 5-3-3-2  with bits outside  I think  is borderline|pg||
nt|spooky: 1@C is enough isnt it? it breaks the communication for the 2nd @S ruff you need as defence if declarer goes for a @S ruff?|pg||

nt|mdgraham: that duck may have cost - West gets lucky |pg||

nt|mcarroll: now we have not only rubbish 11 counts bur even rubbish 10 counts getting into action|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it means i have no opinion, except that i don;t feel motivated to assimilate it |pg||
nt|marlowepi: wonder if 3H was forcing. E has quite a borderline hand|pg||
nt|josj: well, it CAN be made...|pg||
pc|s9|nt|mariner1: W likes his @D fit and stiff @S|pg||
nt|ady: looks like one too high |pg||
nt|chick: at least they avoided the disasterous 3N possibility|pg||
nt|ady: some wastage     but n/s kept out of a possible 2@S|pg||
pc|s4|nt|yo_yo: yes but this time it might make 9 tricks|pg||
nt|april7: double fit luckily, just made|pg||
nt|april7: he must play the J in @D and let it run|pg||
nt|mcphee: with the @C suit open as it is he may get @D right|pg||
nt|chick: E's spade bid may have helped :)|pg||
nt|chick: theoritically, switching to trump is good, but he still won't be able to lead another one when he wins @DA, so might as well cash it first|pg||
pc|sA|nt|chick: in normal 2/1, 3@H would be a limit raise with 3 hearts|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|chick: which is what he has|pg||
nt|patricck: i see 7 defensive tricks, 4 spades and one in each other suit. where is the 8th?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ady: e/w play 2/1?|pg||
pc|sK|pc|h5|nt|sybarra: @H|pg||
nt|sybarra: @H,  Happy Valentines day |pg||
nt|mcarroll: yes - which will just encourage them|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|werge: Right|pg||
nt|ralfwil: perhaps E is under pressure after 2 more rounds of @s|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but only -1 is a good result after -300 in OR|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ady: spade needed now|pg||
pc|d6|nt|marlowepi: not much doubt abotu what it means in standard 2/1. how they play it is another question. also potentially debatable is the hand valuation, since with 7LTC it could be treated as a ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: GF, especially with the honors supporting each other and decent heart spots. i am neutral myself|pg||
nt|granguru: NS could have made some number of @S but E bid avoided them to play spades.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: making now|pg||
nt|granguru: In fact i think NS can win 3@S|pg||
nt|granguru: also some number of @D of course|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mariner1: W drives it home and that is reasonable....... E has about as minimum as he could|pg||
nt|mariner1: hold I think|pg||
nt|ady: now they have to guess    I think will get it right|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|ady: I think can make now if he gets hearts right  if first heart is ducked|pg||
nt|spooky: it was -300 in NS..|pg||
pc|d5|nt|geot: Defence found their ruff, so it should be only 620 and 1 imp to VA|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dJ|nt|mdgraham: good effort but no cigar|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i think Hoyland should think before leading a card, not after|pg||
nt|april7: might play for doubleton ace with S|pg||
nt|mcphee: well so much for guessing @D|pg||
nt|april7: not a good idea to take the ace|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|d8|nt|mariner1: and a quick make now|pg||
nt|ady: no still can make with clubs 3-1  as a spec pointed out|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d9|nt|josj: @DJ did not appeal to me either|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|hK|nt|chick: now when the diamonds split, can pitch the losing club|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mcphee: maybe N was too pleased with his lead|pg||
pc|h4|nt|april7: either 3 down or making, what a difference|pg||

nt|mdgraham: it's not a bad suit, and fitting diamond cards|pg||

nt|mariner1: a big THANKS! to Marita Roberg (Norway), our superb operator, for doing an|pg||
nt|mariner1: excellent job!!!|pg||
nt|mariner1: Many thanks to the Norwegian Premier League, The Norwegian Bridge Federation,|pg||
nt|mariner1: Inger Hjellemarken and Harald Skjaeran and all the organizers for helping BBO|pg||
nt|mariner1: bring us the vugraphs|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but as has been pointed out, 3@H takes a lot of room  in a 2/1 system.  |pg||
nt|ady: another chance for n/s to close the gap|pg||
nt|granguru: looks like 4@h is an easy task...even 11 tricks possible|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hordaland now in the 23-7 VP range|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|mariner1: played we had issues starting|pg||
nt|cindy: this and one more now|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: and thanks for their wit and insight to my co-commentators Cornelia Yoder (USA),|pg||

nt|mariner1: Brown (USA)........|pg||
nt|mariner1: Roland Wald (Denmark) is the BBO vugraph co-ordinator and works diligently at it!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You can make 6@C and 6NT, but not 6@H|pg||
nt|mariner1: Last but not least, a round of applause for our hosts: Fred, Sheri, Uday, Bill Gates,|pg||
nt|mariner1: Sharon Osberg, and David Smith. Without them there would have been no|pg||

nt|ady: thx    sorry arriving late|pg||
nt|ady: lol|pg||
nt|mariner1: 23 minutes until next session is scheduled|pg||
nt|yo_yo: another 11 count   this time 4441|pg||
nt|ady: I think this shows  5 spades and 4 of a minor|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|yo_yo: t/fer to 1nt?|pg||
nt|chick: 2@S presumably spades+minor|pg||
nt|mcarroll: yes everything lies well|pg||
nt|granguru: What a hard moment for Svendsen|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Difficult to reach 4@H now lol!|pg||
nt|ady: can only make on a diamond or trump lead|pg||
nt|ady: west considering|pg||
nt|ady: in fact cant make on any lead|pg||
nt|granguru: deep finesse in @c to make 5@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: 2C could work very well here, though obviously 2S is the pedestrian bid|pg||
nt|geot: not Ringnes...Mac Gold, eller Steinlager (ja, akkurat som hesten) heter ølet her. JEg er i New Zealand:)|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|cindy: pointless for N to bid 4@h|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Furunes wont want to excite his partner|pg||
nt|chick: E is likely to have some hearts, but very unlikely to have any points, which means finessing will be tough|pg||
nt|werge: This board, I prefer to bis 7 @s - than saty in gameHier sp|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: 6@C and 6NT are cold on any lead if you read it|pg||
nt|mariner1: we do not have result on 32 posted|pg||
nt|werge: stay|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|geot: opps den var til spectator....hihi|pg||
nt|mcphee: just a matter of how many tricks he can manage|pg||
nt|ady: yes     lucky lay for 11 tricks in hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: were these beers?|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|ady: yes  west in trouble  and can be end played|pg||
nt|chick: but 6@H will be the first choice|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: spades rank higher than hearts, so if W can raise them i want pd to know where my values are. also, 2C may slow the opps down, and they may let us play a "belated" 4H, thinking we ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: have perhaps 8 hearts|pg||
nt|yo_yo: do we like that opener?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: some always open 2 aces and a K|pg||
nt|april7: with 5 controls its ok!|pg||
nt|mariner1: @S nice play|pg||
nt|mariner1: J@S|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ady: n/s tried 3NT in the other room    this is cheaper|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: Roland means you have to pitch 5 times in W so squeeze|pg||
nt|cindy: is this a forcing auction now ?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: must be|pg||
nt|cindy: i usually play the opps can always play 4@s|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mcphee: yes, unblocked his suit|pg||
nt|mcphee: lack of table entries|pg||
nt|april7: @H first|pg||
nt|mcphee: so is likely to work on @H first|pg||
nt|mcphee: played from S you get a @H lead and life is easy|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 2@D  Multi   2NT  inquiry    3@C max, unspecified major    3@D  which?    3@H  spades|pg||
nt|patricck: I'd like to thank all my fellow commentators, and the Norwegiam Bridge Federation, but in particular our operator Marita Roberg.... I hope all the kibitzers have enjoyed the match  ...|pg||
nt|patricck: :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Same auction in the other room|pg||
nt|vugraphzdu: thanks :)|pg||
nt|patricck: * oops Norwegian|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ady: n/s have closed the gap|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i am not fond of 4441s at the best of times|pg||
nt|april7: don't cover!|pg||
nt|mcarroll: A lot better than some openings we have seen for me it is fine as there is no rebid problem|pg||
nt|yo_yo: the @S 8 saves the day|pg||
pc|d4|nt|yo_yo: will North be calculating the LTT?|pg||
nt|frankaus: 2@S - @H raise limit or better as we play it here|pg||
nt|chick: same here|pg||
nt|cicus: probably an overtrick here|pg||
pc|d5|nt|yo_yo: or as it's called here the LTB |pg||
nt|cicus: either by leading towards @HJ or taking 2 club tricks|pg||
nt|werge: Excuse me - WHAT is (was) 2 @D (semi-forcing - almost).  |pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South will be wishing he was in a slam here - for a moment|pg||
nt|april7: N will need a @H trick for the contract|pg||
nt|josj: or the @SK...|pg||
nt|april7: twice then ace of @Dand @D|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Only 1@S would get them to the excellent slam|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s9|nt|april7: @C and @H 10|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|april7: on general principle, just ducking is not always good|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Anyone for 1@S or a weak 2 for you?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|josj: this time, E did well to duck both @HK and @CK|pg||
pc|hA|nt|marlowepi: probably close to a universal treatment. whether it is the best bid tactically (as opposed to descriptively), however, is another issue|pg||
nt|cicus: only problem is to get off dummy|pg||
nt|ady: 5@H only 10 tricks  as a spec pointed out  in spite of the fortunate lay of clubs|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ady: good news for south|pg||
nt|cicus: after @D ruff|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|chick: one of those hands where you HOPE everything is off, and it is this time |pg||
nt|april7: best lead now @C|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sK|pc|s2|pg||
nt|sybarra: thought I was going to make it til, end, but have to dash,  have fun all |pg||
nt|sybarra: :)|pg||
nt|april7: 9 of @C is the entry to @H or @S trick|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ty shirley|pg||
nt|Walddk4: In fact, 7@C is on|pg||
nt|werge: I mean, when you have an opening bid, normally you open then...|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ady: but can make 4@H   so this is a good save|pg||
pc|s4|nt|josj: 9 tricks now|pg||
pc|h7|nt|april7: still problems,because N can t cash ace of @D|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|mdgraham: can claim now|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mariner1: even with this board there are not a lot of imps scored in 16 boards|pg||
nt|ady: more than halved the gap|pg||

nt|april7: I mean with E|pg||
nt|spooky: I would open 2@S weak, but im used to play it like a good hand|pg||
nt|ralfwil: This is a way to reach 4@s but in my system I bid 4@c asking partner to bid the suit below his multi|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I agree - this seems to me too good for a weak 2S opening - even a max|pg||
nt|patricck: 1@S for me, too good for my grotty weak twos  :)|pg||
mc|12|nt|werge: Never a week two with a 1@S-opening|pg||

nt|vugraphzdu: think so :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: have you any links for us Marita?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: or anyone?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: is this the same Erichsen who lives in London?|pg||

nt|chick: Results:  http://nbfdata.bridge.no/Turnering/default.asp?Fil=2009div1|pg||
nt|yo_yo: so it seems the teams here are 1 and  2|pg||
nt|yo_yo: and we have a lady at the table  hurray|pg||
nt|geot: Looks like Midt Trøndelag (MT) ended in 3Nt on board 18. It was a good 6@C, difficult to bid, very nice fit|pg||
nt|granguru: cards also here now|pg||
nt|vugraphzdu: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Yes, this is Espen Erichsen who lives in London|pg||
nt|yo_yo: helge|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: ?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: He was a male last I saw him|pg||
nt|frankaus: g'day roland welcome|pg||
nt|april7: hello everybody and good afternoon|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Sam Inge|pg||
nt|april7: E will be in 4@S making 6|pg||
nt|ady: n/s  probably end up in 3NT    should be a trick short on heart lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: oh dear my apologies|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i thought it was a female name|pg||
nt|Walddk4: E-W are brothers, Helge and Roar|pg||
mb|2N|nt|geot: same contract in OR on board 18|pg||
nt|ralfwil: we didn´t see the bidding and how they fell|pg||
nt|vugraphzdu: hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: allowing for the 3rd hand opening, 2@H seems enough here|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: hello avram and hello again Marita|pg||
nt|april7: 3NT by N, what was the X?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: how many ladies playing now Marita ( she asks hopefully)?|pg||
nt|granguru: y. highest contract is 3m|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: so a quiet start to this second half|pg||
pc|d5|nt|april7: hello Kath|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://nbfdata.bridge.no/Turnering/default.asp?Fil=2009div1   for standing after round 6 of 9|pg||
nt|josj: this lead should save a trick|pg||
nt|april7: a tricky lead holding E to 5 perhaps|pg||
nt|ady: east raising will help the defence|pg||
pc|d4|nt|frankaus: how many times will W be end played this hand ?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i am looking down the list for women's names  |pg||
pc|dA|nt|yo_yo: how many ladies playing operator?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: None|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|yo_yo: shame|pg||
nt|spooky: hmm this lead looks friendly for declarer|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mcarroll: Hi all -sorry for the late arrival traffic problems|pg||
nt|ady: South very agressive earlier  and continues    should not work this hand|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|cicus: I would have passed out 3@D|pg||
nt|chick: Hi Martin|pg||
nt|ady: hi Martin|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|geot: but as the layout is - both finesses are on - N/S would make 3@H|pg||
nt|Walddk4: How many women do you have in the English Premier League?  2 or 3?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi Avram|pg||
nt|yo_yo: lots :)|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|daman: Hey Everyone|pg||
pc|h7|nt|Walddk4: Not in the Premier League, that is not correct|pg||
pc|h6|nt|yo_yo: answers range from one to two|pg||
nt|yo_yo: no more norwegian ladies??|pg||
nt|vugraphzdu: 1|pg||
nt|geot: Grøtheim avoided to lead a heart|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Frances Hinden, Heather Dhondy and maybe one more|pg||
nt|granguru: Hi Hi|pg||
pc|h4|nt|yo_yo: Michelle Brunner|pg||
nt|april7: on inspired @C switch N goes downif W switches to @H after second @C|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|mcarroll: One of the benefits of a strong club system is that you can play these hands at 1NT|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|sybarra: N probably a bit surprised to win that trick |pg||
nt|ady: hi George|pg||
nt|daman: in the previous session we saw that Hoyland/Bakke are a very aggressive and imaginitive bidders|pg||
nt|ady: problem for Bakke  either sell out for 2@H   or play 3NT|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c3|pc|cK|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a @s shift!|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d8|nt|yo_yo: 2 out of  50-60?  not very high percentage ladies!|pg||
nt|frankaus: now trump will set it|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Nice lead. |pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/2008MindSportGamesBeijing/Systems/Open/Norway/Groetheim_Tundal.pdf   for the N-S convention card|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|chick: W didn't dare risk giving up the lead until he had trumped his spades, now -1|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
pc|d6|pc|s4|nt|Walddk4: Please keep it someone, I am not in this room constantly|pg||
nt|geot: spade would also have been terrible for the defence. Now they had a chance to set it twice |pg||

nt|chick: hi Cindy|pg||
nt|frankaus: welcome cindy marshall|pg||
nt|ady: compensation last hand  3@d can go down 1|pg||
nt|spooky: +1?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdu: +1|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: ty frank|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hi|pg||
nt|yo_yo: you are surrounded Frank|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: he loves it :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Sven-Olai Høyland one of three brothers in the Hordaland 1 team. The other two are Same Inge and Jim|pg||
mb|1S|nt|cindy: :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: In fact  S bid 3@h and perhaps 3@c with 3@h and 5@c|pg||
nt|geot: I am surprised S played that heart. North followed trumps from below, not asking for H ?|pg||
nt|daman: like soothing a wound with Tiger Balm|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Friendly defence helps of course|pg||
mb|2H|nt|spooky: looked like he still had a @S to lose..|pg||
nt|werge: After that lead - it was - more or less - over|pg||
mb|2S|nt|frankaus: used to it  - live with wife - have to daughters|pg||
nt|april7: 2@S already 1 down|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that 2NT is a bit thin|pg||
nt|sybarra: Pard apparently took him seriously |pg||
mb|2N!|nt|frankaus: two |pg||
nt|cindy: wouldnt you bid 1N with N hand ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: is Wests bid weak 2?or tartan?|pg||
nt|werge: Spoorty 6 @D here...|pg||
mb|4H|nt|cicus: now NS  ha sto find their ruff|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: ace of spades lead, then...|pg||
nt|cicus: not any more|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 2NT is too much with a singleton spade and only 8 hcp|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good morning to Bob McPhee from Canada|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: I wouldn't|pg||
nt|yo_yo: a cowardly pass |pg||
nt|cicus: hmm, don't seem they have 10 tricks anyway|pg||
nt|sybarra: or maybe just talking E out of bidding?|pg||
nt|april7: N escaped the X|pg||
nt|april7: loserwise there could be a @C game and S might try for it,but game will fail on bad distribution|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: white vs red   keeps them from bidding nt    good values|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i mean i would bid a cowardly pass|pg||
nt|mcphee: hello all|pg||
nt|josj: gm Bob|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ralfwil: and not even won the contract!|pg||
pc|s4|nt|vugraphzdu: 2@H is Tartan|pg||
nt|april7: hello Bob|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|cindy: hand is nothing to be ashamed of|pg||
nt|chick: but you don't know if partner can say the same :)|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|april7: on @h lead a good guess will help|pg||
nt|josj: 5@C looks sensible enough, yes - but not if you're playing for money|pg||
nt|april7: @D 10 lead is probably best|pg||
nt|mcarroll: And now a chance to even make it|pg||
pc|s7|nt|cindy: how much can N have   he is passed hand   and has 9 hcp and 3 10s|pg||
nt|cindy: i just worry about my cards|pg||
nt|cindy: partner is on his own|pg||
nt|mcphee: this is a game you would like to be in I think|pg||
nt|josj: maybe, W is squeezed in the end...|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sT|pc|sK|pg||
nt|mcarroll: No still -1|pg||
pc|hK|nt|yo_yo: i have good defence and they are vulnerable|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h5|nt|cindy: that is true|pg||
nt|werge: 100 against 1370 is not so bad...|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|geot: Good chance now. Will lead a club after trumps. Then knock out the spade A for discard|pg||
nt|april7: @D is probably best return for the dcefence|pg||
nt|mcphee: seems to me this has a very good play|pg||
nt|mcphee: the defence is not able to lead @H|pg||
nt|ady: same again   3@C  down 1   converted to 3NT down 1|pg||
pc|h2|nt|geot: losing two clubs and a spade|pg||
nt|cicus: oh yes|pg||
nt|geot: Good result for VA this one, cant see he will go wrong now, so probably +620|pg||
nt|spooky: 1370?|pg||
pc|h8|nt|april7: good duck by W,otherwise only 1 down|pg||
nt|josj: @C9 might be difficult to cope with|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|s6|pg||
nt|mcphee: yes it will be now that has trumped low|pg||
nt|werge: 6 D is ice-cold...|pg||
pc|hA|pc|c2|pc|h3|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|mcphee: trump not so bad|pg||
nt|april7: N will try @C finesse and contract will then fail on @C return|pg||
nt|mcphee: too bad 3-1 @C this hand really|pg||
nt|josj: and @S 5-1 as well :(|pg||
nt|spooky: do you expect the other room to bid this 6@D?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|geot: the point of the declaring was the timing, playing a club after drawing trumps|pg||
pc|d5|nt|lestergold: hi  Mike fromUK here|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mcphee: awesome move|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|josj: hi Mike|pg||
nt|april7: if finesse would succeed and @C 2-2 then it would be ok|pg||
nt|mcphee: still things are not hopeless here|pg||
nt|werge: No - may be 3 @D|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c5|nt|mcarroll: E has to work hard to avoid being end-played|pg||
nt|yo_yo: have we a link for the current standings?|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|spooky: not 4@S?|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|werge: Better|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mcphee: looks to be making it|pg||
nt|josj: I think so too|pg||
nt|mcphee: if he guess's the @H position|pg||
nt|josj: on a now obviously correct @H guess|pg||
nt|josj: W did not return a @H|pg||
nt|april7: he thinks about trumping with K and playing @C|pg||
pc|h6|nt|frankaus: opps in forcing auction - i thinh i can afford to pass|pg||
nt|cindy: they arent in forcing auction|pg||
nt|cindy: W was a passed hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.bridge.no/|pg||
nt|april7: J of @S|pg||
nt|sybarra: that is the tourney site |pg||
