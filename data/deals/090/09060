mb|d|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 1NT? hmm|pg||

nt|yo_yo: would you?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: just 2@D?|pg||

nt|marlowepi: well, that might depend on your agreements|pg||
nt|cindy: i know what you mean    hands like this can be difficult to handle when dbl first|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i think he'll show his 5 card major|pg||
nt|chick: I dunno, pard should have 4 spades, 3 at least, and might miss a vul game in spades|pg||
nt|chick: trade that off against how much you can set a 1 level bid|pg||

nt|marlowepi: don;t know why partner has to have that many spades, nor do i have any desire to defend 1HX before i know if we have a grand slam|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|mariner1: REDBL here asked for the minor I am sure|pg||

nt|cindy: lol|pg||
nt|cindy: moving targets|pg||
nt|cindy: only 1 trick short on non trump lead  :o|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but just look at what a HUGE difference it would make if one of S's clubs were another spade. the 3-card trump length is a big negative|pg||
nt|cindy: yes|pg||
nt|chick: and a good reason not to try the slam|pg||
nt|cindy: N contributed with 2@s|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in all fairness, S probably thought he DID have four spades--after all, he made a takeout double|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Erichsen thinks he can count 12 tricks and I sympathize with that|pg||

nt|mariner1: excellent job!!!|pg||
nt|mariner1: Many thanks to the Norwegian Premier League, The Norwegian Bridge Federation,|pg||
nt|mariner1: Inger Hjellemarken and Harald Skjaeran and all the organizers for helping BBO|pg||
nt|mariner1: bring us the vugraphs|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but as has been pointed out, 3@H takes a lot of room  in a 2/1 system.  |pg||
nt|ady: another chance for n/s to close the gap|pg||
mb|1H|nt|mariner1: played we had issues starting|pg||

mb|1S|nt|mariner1: and thanks for their wit and insight to my co-commentators Cornelia Yoder (USA),|pg||
nt|mariner1: Mike Graham and David Edwin (England), and Roland Wald (Denmark).....I am Rob|pg||
nt|mariner1: Brown (USA)........|pg||
nt|mariner1: Roland Wald (Denmark) is the BBO vugraph co-ordinator and works diligently at it!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You can make 6@C and 6NT, but not 6@H|pg||
nt|mariner1: Last but not least, a round of applause for our hosts: Fred, Sheri, Uday, Bill Gates,|pg||
nt|mariner1: Sharon Osberg, and David Smith. Without them there would have been no|pg||

nt|ady: lol|pg||
nt|mariner1: 23 minutes until next session is scheduled|pg||
mb|2S|mb|3S|nt|marlowepi: 2C could work very well here, though obviously 2S is the pedestrian bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: pointless for N to bid 4@h|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Furunes wont want to excite his partner|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: 6@C and 6NT are cold on any lead if you read it|pg||

nt|chick: but 6@H will be the first choice|pg||
mb|4S|nt|marlowepi: spades rank higher than hearts, so if W can raise them i want pd to know where my values are. also, 2C may slow the opps down, and they may let us play a "belated" 4H, thinking we ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: have perhaps 8 hearts|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mariner1: Roland means you have to pitch 5 times in W so squeeze|pg||

mb|5H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: n/s have closed the gap|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: will North be calculating the LTT?|pg||
nt|frankaus: 2@S - @H raise limit or better as we play it here|pg||
nt|chick: same here|pg||
pc|sA|nt|yo_yo: or as it's called here the LTB |pg||

pc|s9|pc|h4|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|pc|h2|pc|h3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: probably close to a universal treatment. whether it is the best bid tactically (as opposed to descriptively), however, is another issue|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ady: good news for south|pg||
