nt|Walddk2: 59.02 - 5. Kowalski - Tuszynski, Poland, 56.84|pg||
mb|p|nt|fred: We will be seeing a lot of Eric Rodwell and Jeff Meckstroth this session. Many consider this pair to be the best in the world. They are defending champions in this event|pg||
nt|migry: west has an awkward bid if south opens 1@c|pg||
nt|migry: i'm sure i got that word wrong:)|pg||
nt|fred: I think Rodwell will double|pg||
mb|1C|mb|d|nt|reisig: I agree|pg||
mb|1D|nt|migry: he did and fast|pg||
mb|1H|mb|d!|nt|Walddk2: Meckwell are 21st on 51.43%, but early days yet|pg||
nt|migry: double shows 4 @s and a balanced hand|pg||
mb|3H|nt|fred: Creative 1@H by Meckstroth|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 51 rounds of 2 boards. This is round 14|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jbgood: lines a bit unstable here|pg||
nt|reisig: 1@h was unusual|pg||
mb|p|pc|sK|nt|fred: NS don't make much of anything so important for Meckstroth to make this|pg||
nt|fred: If he does then +140 rates to be worth a lot of matchpoints|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|pc|s3|pg||

nt|fred: One thing to watch with Meckstroth and Rodwell is how well they play the vulnerability|pg||
nt|fred: once in a while you hear a quote from someone famous saying "vulnerability is for children", but if you watch these 2 carefully you will realize how wrong that is.|pg||

nt|fred: Note Meckstroth's good technique of playing on clubs early. He can afford to lose a club ruff|pg||

nt|fred: The only way EW can do better is if they double NS at, say 3@D|pg||
nt|migry: the 1st board was 62% for ew|pg||
nt|dburn: Indeed - a very nice result. Meckwell will need a few more of them to defend their title, though.|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Slem - Vozabal are from the Czech Republic|pg||
pc|h4|nt|fred: Well Rodwell would have bid 2@C if he has not vul :)|pg||
nt|migry: that was about the ugliest overcall i've seen lately (not counting mine)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And North's name is actually spelled   Slemr|pg||
nt|fred: 3NT will play well|pg||
nt|fred: of course declarer doesn't know how friendly the layout is in clubs and diamonds|pg||
nt|dburn: Better than 2@h doubled would have played, anyway|pg||
nt|fred: from his point of view there are serious communication problems|pg||
nt|dburn: Entries to the North hand are at something of a premium|pg||
nt|fred: but it seems natural to play on diamonds|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|d3|pc|d4|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d8|pc|d6|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|dburn: but at least on this auction, he won't waste time trying a heart to the king, which may happen at some tables on a spade lead|pg||
nt|dburn: or a club lead from West|pg||
nt|fred: I think there is a lot to be said for winning the @HK at trick 1 to play a diamond.|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sJ|pc|s5|nt|jbgood: of course playing an intermediate or small diamond off dummy would have worked nice here - declarer cannot see the favourable lie of course|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|dburn: I was wondering about that - seems a good idea id East has such as @dKx or dQx|pg||
nt|dburn: Still, declarer can force an entry to his hand with the fourth diamond, and ought to come to ten tricks - unless he ducks @cQ if East shifts to it|pg||
pc|d2|pc|c5|pc|d7|pc|dK|pg||
nt|dburn: which it is far from clear not to do|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|dburn: We shall see...|pg||

nt|dburn: I'd think that was about right - maybe a little more|pg||
nt|Vugraph99: 29.9% was the result|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: or a little less :)|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h5|nt|fred: Interesting pass by South|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|fred: Most likely he would have done better to play in diamonds|pg||
nt|dburn: Maybe he could't get out in diamond below the three level, and hoped they would be some use in 1NT|pg||
nt|reisig: May pay a heavy price for the Pass|pg||
nt|dburn: as indeed they may be - if the defenders don't get around to spades|pg||
nt|fred: Declarer can win the first 8 tricks via a club finesse, that would be an unusual play|pg||
nt|jbgood: an "easy" 130 in @d|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|c4|pc|c7|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h9|pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||

pc|cK|nt|fred: wow great play|pg||
pc|s6|pc|d2|pc|c5|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|reisig: wonderful recovery|pg||
nt|fred: he reasoned that Meck likely had spade length|pg||
pc|d8|nt|fred: and he knew Meck had heart length|pg||
pc|d3|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|c8|nt|fred: therefore club shortness likely|pg||
pc|s7|nt|fred: in a vacuum it is right to play clubs from the top with that combination|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s3|pg||
nt|dburn: Can he come to a ninth trick here?|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dJ|pc|d5|pc|d7|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dK|pc|d6|pc|dT|pg||
nt|dburn: Looks as though he might|pg||
nt|fred: he is going to make 3. +150 will be a great score|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h6|pc|s4|pc|hT|pg||
nt|dburn: Either @h8 or @sQ ought to be a winner at the end|pg||
nt|reisig: so much for our predictions...as always:)|pg||
pc|s8|pc|d9|pc|sK|pc|s2|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|dburn: so maybe Vozabal knew what he was doing leaving Slemr in 1NT - he has certainly made a fine job of the play|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h8|pc|sT|pc|s9|pg||
nt|fred: What do you think? 85% for NS?|pg||
nt|dburn: At least, would be my guess. And they didn't do so badly on board 3 - 48% or so now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The next round will be an all French affair. Bompis - Sainte Marie v Levy - Mouiel|pg||
nt|reisig: 85-92%|pg||
nt|dburn: The Swan results show only 120 to North-South|pg||
nt|ritong: i have several questions " why did fred say @s length" , the idea is, i guess , that rodwell did not balance|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Please do not send me private chat messages. They will appear on a giant screen here, so I shall have to ignore them anyway. No offence intended|pg||
nt|dburn: Maybe North isn't as good with the Bridgemate as he is with the club suit|pg||
nt|fred: turns out a spade opening lead would have been better|pg||
nt|fred: but heart would be the choice of most experts in my view|pg||
nt|jbgood: agreed|pg||
nt|reisig: Yes -- usually better to lead from K9xx than A8xx|pg||
nt|dburn: Well, Rodwell did not open, as he would on a lot of hands with six spades|pg||
pg||
qx|o5|st||md|3SAQ9HKQJ2DAT76C84,S6H94D854CKT97632,SKT532HA763DK2CAJ,SJ874HT85DQJ93CQ5|sv|n|nt|ritong: alain levy, who arrives at the table, thinks that the higher the blank Hxxx is, the more dangerous the opening lead is versus NTs|pg||
nt|fred: I have had several questions concerning why East did not lead 4th from his longest and strongest on the last hand. About the answer I can give is that leading from Axxx against ...|pg||
nt|fred: notrump (especially 1NT) is generally frowned upon in expert circles.|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|reisig: Better avoid a grand|pg||
nt|dburn: Here is a possible grand slam - 7@h has chances, but may go down with this spade break|pg||
mb|3C|nt|Walddk2: 3@C is not for minors and people with weak hearts (or clubs perhaps)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|fred: We are taking a break from Meckstroth-Rodwell to watch some of France's finest players|pg||
nt|dburn: 3@c is for one of the minors|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|reisig: I expect a 4@c cue|pg||
mb|4C|mb|d|nt|fred: Mouiel already won a Silver Medal in Tenerife. He came 2nd in the Mixed Pairs|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|dburn: Indeed - and I expect it to be doubled, to attract an effective lead against hearts|pg||
nt|fred: 3@C was an effective preempt even though it wasn't a jump :)|pg||
nt|reisig: Isn't 4@s a cue bid here?|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|dburn: I would have thought so|pg||
nt|dburn: and so does Bompis|pg||
nt|ritong: i d say that @hs are established|pg||
nt|fred: is it clear that 4@C agrees hearts?|pg||
nt|ritong: there was no 3@s|pg||
nt|dburn: I guess 3@s would be forcing, so I imagine 4@c might agree hearts|pg||
nt|ritong: by dSM|pg||
nt|jbgood: guess it sh accept last bid suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Mixed pairs won by Gunn and Tor Helness of Norway from Willard - Mouiel and Debbie and Michael Rosenberg|pg||
mb|5H|nt|dburn: Not sure why South has attempted to sign off|pg||
nt|dburn: I'd have thought his partner's bidding would have been enough for him to try at least 6@h|pg||
mb|p|mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c2|nt|dburn: and the one thing you should take care not to do is sign off slowly in an auction like this|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|pc|c4|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|c3|pc|h7|pc|hT|pg||

nt|fred: turns out he could have made 7 by ruffing 2 diamonds in dummy, declarer took normal line of play|pg||
nt|dburn: Good thing Levy didn't lead @cK|pg||
nt|migry: west wd have been under lotsssssssssss of pressure|pg||
nt|migry: east|pg||
nt|dburn: Now, declarer has twelve tricks only - but that may not be a bad result, as some might fail in seven|pg||
nt|Walddk2: During our next break David Burn will probably tell us about the radio interview he did with the BBC after he returned from Tenerife (the Lanzarotti-Buratti incident)|pg||
nt|reisig: 75+% result|pg||
nt|dburn: or even, perhaps, in 6@s|pg||
nt|fred: and i don't you will see very many declarers winning 13 tricks on this one|pg||

nt|fred: Just looking at NS cards, 3NT is a very nice contract|pg||
nt|reisig: swindy hand|pg||
nt|reisig: swingy|pg||
nt|ritong: as you can see, "weak" is a relative concept for mouiel|pg||
mb|4S|nt|fred: Meanwhile EW do well in spades|pg||
nt|dburn: That's very much the French style - solid weak twos, especially vulnerable|pg||
nt|ritong: relative to the vulnerability, that is|pg||
nt|migry: north may try 4NT|pg||
nt|fred: Bompis has a strange hand for the bidding|pg||
nt|fred: Normally his partner would have more to bid 3@S |pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|nt|ritong: he is asked, he answers politely:)|pg||
nt|fred: Maybe Levy should have tried 4@H?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: This may work better...|pg||
nt|migry: wd double ask for a @h lead?|pg||
nt|jbgood: interesting|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What lead does double ask for I wonder|pg||
nt|fred: I don't think so|pg||
nt|dburn: ...though South may run now|pg||
nt|reisig: Clearly - not asking @s lead|pg||
nt|migry: or redouble to show doubt|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: I guess double means "try something other than a spade"|pg||
nt|ritong: hot|pg||
nt|dburn: Well, now. Quite a lot of matchpoints at stake here|pg||
nt|migry: i think Mouiel knows what's going on and will lead a @h|pg||
nt|fred: A LOT easier to lead a heart with all the hands in view. I will be impressed if he gets it right (but not surprised)|pg||
nt|reisig: I agree|pg||
nt|dburn: Declarer is in principle a 12-1 favourrite, but|pg||
nt|jbgood: guess Mouiel will find it by eleminating minor suits|pg||
nt|migry:  a @s is not very attractive|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ritong: yo|pg||
nt|jbgood: bravo|pg||

pc|h3|pc|hA|nt|dburn: but now, he is a slight underdog|pg||

nt|fred: the field in Tenerife is extremely strong.|pg||
nt|migry: in the open especially|pg||
nt|fred: I was there for most of the tournament, but I came home yesterday|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We are in Tenerife, the largest of the Canary Islands for the 2nd Open European Championships. The Canary Islands are governed by Spain although the distance is quite significant|pg||
nt|fred: i was most impressed by how well our opponents played throughout the tournament|pg||
nt|migry: it took me 16 hours to get to tel aviv from tenerife:)|pg||
nt|reisig: In South's seat ..I'd run ..asking partner for stoppers in 3 suits is a bit much|pg||
nt|fred: the tournament itself was very well organized and Tenerife is a wonderful venue for a major championships|pg||
nt|fred: If NS play in diamonds there are 3 sure losers for declarer|pg||
nt|fred: and no possible squeeze position|pg||
nt|Walddk2: One more round without Meckwell. They will be back in round 5 and 6, 8, 9, 12 and 13|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Hauge earned around 100 million Norwegian kroner (about $17 million) on a TV deal (football) about a week ago, so I think he can afford to sponsor Helness in this event|pg||

nt|Walddk2: football = soccer in this context|pg||

nt|ritong: capture Qxxx:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Tom Townsend is one of our regular vugraph commentators as you may recall. mug is his username|pg||
mb|p|nt|fred: 4@S is a nice contract for NS here - expect it to be reached|pg||
mb|1S|nt|jbgood: Hauge - Helness won the last session in the Semi-Finals yesterday - Helness was declarer most of the time|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: the correct following is offer a drink to south if it fails|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|migry: maybe not so difficult to get there|pg||

nt|dburn: Your husband can't play with Helness in the Mixed Pairs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: With Mrs. Helness he can|pg||
nt|migry: okayyyyyyy|pg||
nt|fred: This is what you call a "flat board" - expect almost all the field to play 4@S and win exactly 10 tricks.|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|dburn: Not sure what 2@d is - Tor Helness isn't a great one for gadgets, but this looks like one|pg||
