mb|p|nt|mariner1: that was how Open bid it|pg||
nt|cindy: well   there it may be true|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a nice 6@d? |pg||

mb|1H|nt|cindy: but here you have meckwell stealing from you all the time|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N!|nt|mdgraham: it can be useful to have the agreement that, when you splinter as opener, your first suit is really good |pg||
nt|cicus: although 6NT is on but...|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: so in spite of missing a grand slam  Vest agder go into the lead|pg||
nt|cindy: teaches you real fast not to be a coward|pg||
mb|2H|an|()|nt|mariner1: very true Mike.........|pg||
nt|geot: 1NT is forcing, may be start of relays, which it is this time|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: 1NT is FG relay|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Grøtheim asking, Tundal showing|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|frankaus: we bid on flea tickets here  but not with 4333's|pg||
nt|ralfwil: what should 2@c from N mean?|pg||
nt|geot: Now relays. We can count on that N will show his distribution etc etc..and then I think Grøtheim will find out enough to bid 6@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: we say "tram" tickets|pg||
nt|cindy: well  here everyone bids aggressively so you have field protection|pg||
nt|cicus: no details in sysrtem card|pg||
nt|geot: I am not sure about 2@C, but I think a max hand|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I have an expert in the audience|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 2@H  min  not 6 hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 2@S relay|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 3@D  side suit in clubs|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I cannt understand the sys of NS, says a spectator. I don't blame him|pg||
nt|cicus: I would bid 3@H now :)|pg||
nt|geot: he he|pg||
nt|geot: I guess S will bid 3@H too, to find out the distribution in S+D|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The system allows them to pinpoint jacks if they like, aparat from shape, hcp concentration and controls|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Very sophusticated system|pg||
nt|Walddk4: We would all bid 7NT of course|pg||
nt|geot: Sorry specs, we cant explain good enough this bidding. It is more than 25 years since I played Precision, then with Grøtheim, when he started developing is good system|pg||
nt|geot: his good system.|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|mariner1: so easy bidding in both rooms|pg||
nt|geot: looks  natural lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: yes - a most honourable push|pg||
nt|yo_yo: opening bid + opening bid = game  thinks Ericksen|pg||
mb|4N|nt|chick: and what's more, with the weakness in the unbid suit, inviting the lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|nt|Walddk4: 3@D  2-5-2-4    4@D  Natural, slammish|pg||
mb|p|mb|6D|mb|p|nt|geot: If S already knew the whole distribution he may go for 6@D, the superior contract. But 6@H, 6NT will make too|pg||
nt|Walddk4: He knew the shape after 3@D|pg||
nt|geot: wd, good bidding (I guess:))|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 5N likely shows the holding and the void|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@D could have been a stiff|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: But he could have asked for more info with 3@H|pg||
nt|ralfwil: even 7nt on a squeeze or double finess in @s witn the lucky @h distribution. but of course the right contract|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|sA|pc|s5|pc|sT|pg||

pc|s3|pc|s2|pg||
pc|s9|nt|mariner1: ok to bypass 5 level as no way 3 controls and a solid @H suit would not be at least|pg||
nt|mariner1: good enough for 6|pg||
nt|cicus: even with 6-2 he will survive as west can only ruff at the cost of his trump trick|pg||

mb|p|nt|mariner1: 1N with 17 and 5 4 might not be my call here|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 2@S showing @S and a minor?|pg||

nt|marlowepi: don;t know why partner has to have that many spades, nor do i have any desire to defend 1HX before i know if we have a grand slam|pg||
nt|cicus: I admit I'd be tempted to bid 4@S even over 1@H|pg||
pc|h2|nt|geot: the problem in defence is taht the clubs are blocked|pg||
nt|geot: so 4@S will make|pg||
nt|geot: West who has the trumps will follow diamonds after the spade A is played|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h7|pc|s2|pg||

nt|marlowepi: WOW-|pg||
nt|yo_yo: he does have an Ginormous hand|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I had not opened 4@h. for me it´s too strong|pg||
nt|geot: To set it west must have led a club, and overtake Easts C Q in the second trick, then give E a ruff for the singleton S5|pg||
nt|geot: setting trick would then have been the spade K. Now declarer will try the diamonds, but actually he dont need to, clubs are blocked|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mariner1: so 2@S showed C or the red suits|pg||
nt|chick: 4@S should have been fast arrival, don't you think?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3H = can you bid game?   4S = i guess i'll give it a shot    6S = OK, then let;'s play slam|pg||
nt|cindy: lol|pg||
nt|cindy: moving targets|pg||
nt|cindy: only 1 trick short on non trump lead  :o|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but just look at what a HUGE difference it would make if one of S's clubs were another spade. the 3-card trump length is a big negative|pg||
nt|cindy: yes|pg||
nt|chick: and a good reason not to try the slam|pg||
nt|cindy: N contributed with 2@s|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in all fairness, S probably thought he DID have four spades--after all, he made a takeout double|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Erichsen thinks he can count 12 tricks and I sympathize with that|pg||
nt|chick: perhaps next time, Furunes will opt for 1@HX :)|pg||
nt|cindy: would you bid 2@s with all those heart cards ?|pg||

nt|geot: N/S ended in 4NT on this one in the other room. Tundals 1@S is limited to 15hcp, so N/S will end in game here, probably 4@S|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: sorry, what was it? i missed the explanation|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: not a great slam    may be a swing here|pg||
nt|cindy: 3N on last hand showed 6 hearts and 3 spades|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it would have advantages on some of those hands. might give up more than it gets. depends on associated agreements, e.g. what the distributional range of 3C is. still probably have ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: to do a simulation to judge|pg||
nt|cicus: maybe an immediate 4@S|pg||

pc|d6|nt|mariner1: next session is scheduled for 32 minutes from now|pg||

pc|s4|nt|mariner1: W likes his @D fit and stiff @S|pg||

nt|marlowepi: GF, especially with the honors supporting each other and decent heart spots. i am neutral myself|pg||

nt|mariner1: Many thanks to the Norwegian Premier League, The Norwegian Bridge Federation,|pg||
nt|mariner1: Inger Hjellemarken and Harald Skjaeran and all the organizers for helping BBO|pg||
nt|mariner1: bring us the vugraphs|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but as has been pointed out, 3@H takes a lot of room  in a 2/1 system.  |pg||
nt|ady: another chance for n/s to close the gap|pg||
mb|1N|nt|mariner1: played we had issues starting|pg||
nt|cindy: this and one more now|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: and thanks for their wit and insight to my co-commentators Cornelia Yoder (USA),|pg||
nt|mariner1: Mike Graham and David Edwin (England), and Roland Wald (Denmark).....I am Rob|pg||
nt|mariner1: Brown (USA)........|pg||
nt|mariner1: Roland Wald (Denmark) is the BBO vugraph co-ordinator and works diligently at it!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You can make 6@C and 6NT, but not 6@H|pg||
nt|mariner1: Last but not least, a round of applause for our hosts: Fred, Sheri, Uday, Bill Gates,|pg||

nt|mariner1: 23 minutes until next session is scheduled|pg||
mb|2H!|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: 2C could work very well here, though obviously 2S is the pedestrian bid|pg||
nt|geot: not Ringnes...Mac Gold, eller Steinlager (ja, akkurat som hesten) heter ølet her. JEg er i New Zealand:)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|cindy: pointless for N to bid 4@h|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Furunes wont want to excite his partner|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: 6@C and 6NT are cold on any lead if you read it|pg||

mb|p|nt|cicus: were these beers?|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ady: yes  west in trouble  and can be end played|pg||
nt|chick: but 6@H will be the first choice|pg||
pc|h4|nt|marlowepi: spades rank higher than hearts, so if W can raise them i want pd to know where my values are. also, 2C may slow the opps down, and they may let us play a "belated" 4H, thinking we ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: have perhaps 8 hearts|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|mariner1: Roland means you have to pitch 5 times in W so squeeze|pg||

pc|d4|pc|d2|pc|d9|nt|ady: n/s have closed the gap|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|yo_yo: will North be calculating the LTT?|pg||
nt|frankaus: 2@S - @H raise limit or better as we play it here|pg||
nt|chick: same here|pg||
nt|cicus: probably an overtrick here|pg||
pc|sA|nt|yo_yo: or as it's called here the LTB |pg||
nt|cicus: either by leading towards @HJ or taking 2 club tricks|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mdgraham: South will be wishing he was in a slam here - for a moment|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sK|pc|s5|pc|s4|pg||
nt|marlowepi: probably close to a universal treatment. whether it is the best bid tactically (as opposed to descriptively), however, is another issue|pg||
nt|cicus: only problem is to get off dummy|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ady: good news for south|pg||

pc|h2|nt|cindy: white vs red   keeps them from bidding nt    good values|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i mean i would bid a cowardly pass|pg||
