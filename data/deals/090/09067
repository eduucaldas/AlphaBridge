nt|vugraphzdu: sorry. we had a bit of problem here. ok now i think :)|pg||
nt|cicus: hello Marita, Geo, Ronald, Ralf|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You can take 7@C to your bank managers and get a big loan|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N!|nt|yo_yo: roland hears everything!|pg||
nt|frankaus: XX will some rescue mechanism|pg||
nt|cicus: as can be seen, a laydown 6@C has been missed|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and  Høyland|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|yo_yo: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: guess its tough to handle trumps and @c with only one entry in dummy|pg||
nt|mdgraham: practical 4@H bid|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://nbfdata.bridge.no/Turnering/default.asp?Fil=2009div1    results (I think)|pg||
nt|april7: 12 tricks in NT but 13 in @C|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 13 in NT too|pg||
nt|Walddk4: South is squeezed in spades and diamonds|pg||
nt|april7: @D finesse :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: No finesse|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|april7: I see only 12|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|Walddk4: The squeeze is automatic, Avram|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|mb|6C|nt|april7: @S/@D?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: that might help - has the option of the spade finesse after discovering a trump losere|pg||
nt|chick: best bet is to play for 2-2 hearts and use the @S entry for finessing clubs|pg||
nt|yo_yo: roald might have regretted that bid had someone doubled|pg||
nt|frankaus: i dont think i want to be at the 3 level with Wests heap of ..........|pg||
nt|yo_yo: me neither|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i would be quaking at the 2 level|pg||
nt|chick: or 1NX|pg||
mb|7C|mb|p|nt|frankaus: maybe a catch up for  missing the slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: but its nicer to be in 7@C,don't you think so?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: you need two entries for that - jack, queen, king ace....need to get back to dummy to hook @C8 |pg||
nt|Walddk4: This is the most simple squeeze there is because it materialies automatically|pg||
nt|Walddk4: materialises  even|pg||
pc|d4|nt|sybarra: and with that lead in NT it would even be easier, just count to 13|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d9|pc|dQ|pg||

mb|1N|mb|2C!|nt|mariner1: so the 2@H shown was just the final contract... not the auction|pg||

nt|cindy: you dont think he had his bid ?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 1@s? why not 1nt?|pg||

pc|dK|nt|mariner1: EW can make 4@D and W bids it|pg||
nt|chick: which he had, sort of :)|pg||
nt|cindy: its too good for 1N|pg||
nt|cindy: and 1N may be conventional for them|pg||
nt|yo_yo: not good enough, you see what happened in OR|pg||
nt|cindy: just because they got a bad result, doesnt mean 1N isnt the correct bid|pg||
pc|d3|nt|frankaus: 4333 opps in a live auction - its a accident waiting to happen to X|pg||
nt|geot: 1@H is the relay, or a natural response in Grøtheims Relay precision|pg||
pc|d2|nt|cicus: 1NT probably stronger|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Results after round 6: http://nbfdata.bridge.no/Turnering/Default.asp?Fil=2009div1|pg||

pc|dT|pg||

pc|c6|pg||

mb|p|nt|cindy: but here you have meckwell stealing from you all the time|pg||

mb|p|nt|frankaus: we bid on flea tickets here  but not with 4333's|pg||
nt|ralfwil: what should 2@c from N mean?|pg||
nt|geot: Now relays. We can count on that N will show his distribution etc etc..and then I think Grøtheim will find out enough to bid 6@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: we say "tram" tickets|pg||

nt|Walddk4: I have an expert in the audience|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 2@H  min  not 6 hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 2@S relay|pg||

nt|Walddk4: I cannt understand the sys of NS, says a spectator. I don't blame him|pg||
nt|cicus: I would bid 3@H now :)|pg||
nt|geot: he he|pg||
nt|geot: I guess S will bid 3@H too, to find out the distribution in S+D|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The system allows them to pinpoint jacks if they like, aparat from shape, hcp concentration and controls|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Very sophusticated system|pg||
nt|Walddk4: We would all bid 7NT of course|pg||
nt|geot: Sorry specs, we cant explain good enough this bidding. It is more than 25 years since I played Precision, then with Grøtheim, when he started developing is good system|pg||
nt|geot: his good system.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: yes - but @d do not run so has to rely on @S finesse|pg||

pc|h4|pc|hA|nt|Walddk4: 3@D  2-5-2-4    4@D  Natural, slammish|pg||

pc|s6|nt|mariner1: 5N likely shows the holding and the void|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@D could have been a stiff|pg||
pc|s4|nt|Walddk4: But he could have asked for more info with 3@H|pg||

nt|mariner1: ok to bypass 5 level as no way 3 controls and a solid @H suit would not be at least|pg||
nt|mariner1: good enough for 6|pg||

nt|cicus: yes, 2@H was weak as the bid 2@C with any invitational hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: good bid though|pg||
nt|sybarra: W hand improved but not enough to bid |pg||
nt|yo_yo: it's hard to improve a yarborough |pg||

nt|chick: lol|pg||

nt|yo_yo: he might get a @S away now|pg||
nt|marlowepi: given that partner couldn;t overcall nonvul vs vul, E might have only 3 spades, and the D king looks poorly placed, "scary" is a distinct underbid|pg||

nt|cindy: finally|pg||
nt|cicus: 4@S is forced now|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 1NT? hmm|pg||
nt|marlowepi: oldtimers would double, some newtimers too|pg||
nt|marlowepi: me, i'd just bid my best suit|pg||
nt|chick: too strong for 2@D|pg||
nt|yo_yo: would you?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: just 2@D?|pg||
nt|frankaus: N will pass i expect|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, that might depend on your agreements|pg||
nt|cindy: i know what you mean    hands like this can be difficult to handle when dbl first|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i think he'll show his 5 card major|pg||
nt|chick: I dunno, pard should have 4 spades, 3 at least, and might miss a vul game in spades|pg||
nt|chick: trade that off against how much you can set a 1 level bid|pg||
nt|geot: wd done South in the CR (Ann K Fuglestad) not to go to 4@S on this one|pg||
mb|1H|nt|mariner1: 1N with 17 and 5 4 might not be my call here|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 2@S showing @S and a minor?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: very diplomatic Rob, that use of the word "might"|pg||
nt|marlowepi: don;t know why partner has to have that many spades, nor do i have any desire to defend 1HX before i know if we have a grand slam|pg||
nt|cicus: I admit I'd be tempted to bid 4@S even over 1@H|pg||
mb|1S|nt|geot: the problem in defence is taht the clubs are blocked|pg||
nt|geot: so 4@S will make|pg||
nt|geot: West who has the trumps will follow diamonds after the spade A is played|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|mariner1: REDBL here asked for the minor I am sure|pg||
nt|yo_yo: South isnt finished|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S is finished i think|pg||
nt|chick: now he is|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|d5|pc|d3|nt|chick: oops|pg||
nt|marlowepi: WOW-|pg||
nt|yo_yo: he does have an Ginormous hand|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I had not opened 4@h. for me it´s too strong|pg||
nt|geot: To set it west must have led a club, and overtake Easts C Q in the second trick, then give E a ruff for the singleton S5|pg||
nt|geot: setting trick would then have been the spade K. Now declarer will try the diamonds, but actually he dont need to, clubs are blocked|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mariner1: so 2@S showed C or the red suits|pg||
nt|chick: 4@S should have been fast arrival, don't you think?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3H = can you bid game?   4S = i guess i'll give it a shot    6S = OK, then let;'s play slam|pg||
nt|cindy: lol|pg||
nt|cindy: moving targets|pg||
nt|cindy: only 1 trick short on non trump lead  :o|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but just look at what a HUGE difference it would make if one of S's clubs were another spade. the 3-card trump length is a big negative|pg||
nt|cindy: yes|pg||
nt|chick: and a good reason not to try the slam|pg||
nt|cindy: N contributed with 2@s|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in all fairness, S probably thought he DID have four spades--after all, he made a takeout double|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Erichsen thinks he can count 12 tricks and I sympathize with that|pg||
nt|chick: perhaps next time, Furunes will opt for 1@HX :)|pg||
nt|cindy: would you bid 2@s with all those heart cards ?|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|yo_yo: another exciting 1NT|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|nt|yo_yo: i might bid 4|pg||

pc|h7|pc|h5|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ralfwil: The @d can alsi be 3-3|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mdgraham: 5@Cx would have been interesting|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mdgraham: think 500/800 depending on the defence|pg||
nt|april7: because of 10 and 9 of @C droping, 7 tricks only, on good defence though|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d6|nt|marlowepi: i am not sure what 12 tricks he would be counting. pd can have 4 spades|pg||

pc|dT|pc|d4|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d9|nt|cindy: im not saying i would pass    i would bid 1@s|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i thought you said you were agressive!|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think 1S has a lot going for it--it is unlikely to end the auction|pg||
nt|cindy: only when its right|pg||

pc|s2|pc|dQ|pg||

pc|s3|pc|h3|pg||
pc|d2|pc|c5|nt|marlowepi: i dont think cindy is being unaggressive with 1S. it is a calculated gamble. when W does not bid, chances are that S has a strong hand. bidding 1S lets S reveal the nature of that ...|pg||

nt|ady: hard to keep out of game   25 hcp|pg||

mb|p|nt|april7: but S allways passed,what does he show|pg||

nt|april7: best contract till now|pg||
nt|april7: 1down only|pg||
nt|yo_yo: South is wishing he had passed now|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: a control bid from S|pg||
nt|sybarra: in US, we would open the S hand with 1 @D |pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: With a @h lead, declarer must play the @hA|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|cindy: yes|pg||

pc|hA|pg||

nt|mdgraham: it's not a bad suit, and fitting diamond cards|pg||
nt|mariner1: and now the last board of this session|pg||
nt|mariner1: a big THANKS! to Marita Roberg (Norway), our superb operator, for doing an|pg||
nt|mariner1: excellent job!!!|pg||
nt|mariner1: Many thanks to the Norwegian Premier League, The Norwegian Bridge Federation,|pg||
nt|mariner1: Inger Hjellemarken and Harald Skjaeran and all the organizers for helping BBO|pg||
nt|mariner1: bring us the vugraphs|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but as has been pointed out, 3@H takes a lot of room  in a 2/1 system.  |pg||
nt|ady: another chance for n/s to close the gap|pg||
mb|1C|nt|mariner1: played we had issues starting|pg||
nt|cindy: this and one more now|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: and thanks for their wit and insight to my co-commentators Cornelia Yoder (USA),|pg||
nt|mariner1: Mike Graham and David Edwin (England), and Roland Wald (Denmark).....I am Rob|pg||
nt|mariner1: Brown (USA)........|pg||
nt|mariner1: Roland Wald (Denmark) is the BBO vugraph co-ordinator and works diligently at it!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You can make 6@C and 6NT, but not 6@H|pg||
nt|mariner1: Last but not least, a round of applause for our hosts: Fred, Sheri, Uday, Bill Gates,|pg||
nt|mariner1: Sharon Osberg, and David Smith. Without them there would have been no|pg||
nt|mariner1: broadcasts. Thanks a lot for creating a site that is greatly appreciated by bridge|pg||
nt|mariner1: lovers worldwide!|pg||
nt|ady: thx    sorry arriving late|pg||
nt|ady: lol|pg||
nt|mariner1: 23 minutes until next session is scheduled|pg||
nt|yo_yo: another 11 count   this time 4441|pg||
mb|1S!|nt|yo_yo: t/fer to 1nt?|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: 2C could work very well here, though obviously 2S is the pedestrian bid|pg||
nt|geot: not Ringnes...Mac Gold, eller Steinlager (ja, akkurat som hesten) heter ølet her. JEg er i New Zealand:)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|cindy: pointless for N to bid 4@h|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Furunes wont want to excite his partner|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: 6@C and 6NT are cold on any lead if you read it|pg||
nt|mariner1: we do not have result on 32 posted|pg||
mb|3N|nt|geot: opps den var til spectator....hihi|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: were these beers?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: yes  west in trouble  and can be end played|pg||
nt|chick: but 6@H will be the first choice|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: spades rank higher than hearts, so if W can raise them i want pd to know where my values are. also, 2C may slow the opps down, and they may let us play a "belated" 4H, thinking we ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: have perhaps 8 hearts|pg||
nt|yo_yo: do we like that opener?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: some always open 2 aces and a K|pg||
nt|april7: with 5 controls its ok!|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|nt|mariner1: Roland means you have to pitch 5 times in W so squeeze|pg||
nt|cindy: is this a forcing auction now ?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: must be|pg||
nt|cindy: i usually play the opps can always play 4@s|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ady: n/s have closed the gap|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i am not fond of 4441s at the best of times|pg||
nt|april7: don't cover!|pg||
nt|mcarroll: A lot better than some openings we have seen for me it is fine as there is no rebid problem|pg||
nt|yo_yo: the @S 8 saves the day|pg||
pc|d3|nt|yo_yo: will North be calculating the LTT?|pg||
nt|frankaus: 2@S - @H raise limit or better as we play it here|pg||
nt|chick: same here|pg||
nt|cicus: probably an overtrick here|pg||
pc|d5|nt|yo_yo: or as it's called here the LTB |pg||
nt|cicus: either by leading towards @HJ or taking 2 club tricks|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South will be wishing he was in a slam here - for a moment|pg||
nt|april7: N will need a @H trick for the contract|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c4|nt|april7: @C and @H 10|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c2|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hQ|nt|marlowepi: probably close to a universal treatment. whether it is the best bid tactically (as opposed to descriptively), however, is another issue|pg||
nt|cicus: only problem is to get off dummy|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ady: good news for south|pg||
nt|cicus: after @D ruff|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|sT|nt|chick: one of those hands where you HOPE everything is off, and it is this time |pg||
nt|april7: best lead now @C|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s7|pc|s4|pg||
nt|sybarra: thought I was going to make it til, end, but have to dash,  have fun all |pg||
nt|sybarra: :)|pg||
nt|april7: 9 of @C is the entry to @H or @S trick|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ty shirley|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c6|pc|cJ|nt|april7: still problems,because N can t cash ace of @D|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|mdgraham: can claim now|pg||
pc|s9|nt|mariner1: even with this board there are not a lot of imps scored in 16 boards|pg||

nt|yo_yo: surfers paradise yes  a great tournament|pg||
nt|marlowepi: apologies to specs for ending with a lowly 1NT contract. i tried to double so chick could redouble and make it interesting, but the VG operator wasn;t having it|pg||
nt|yo_yo: except for the surf|pg||

mb|2N|mb|p|nt|frankaus: used to it  - live with wife - have to daughters|pg||

pc|hT|nt|chick: I wouldn't|pg||
nt|yo_yo: a cowardly pass |pg||
nt|cicus: hmm, don't seem they have 10 tricks anyway|pg||
nt|sybarra: or maybe just talking E out of bidding?|pg||
