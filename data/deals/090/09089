pc|dK|pc|d2|pc|d3|pc|dT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: technically, @CJ is best, but that may tempt declarer to put in the queen anyway |pg||
nt|mdgraham: not best if aprrtner has singleton @CA, of course |pg||
nt|ralfwil: Correct Mike, but to have a crossruff in the defence E has to play @c7|pg||
nt|mmmakela: technically heart is best random deals|pg||
nt|april7: but not here, |pg||
nt|april7: if E plays small @C and S doesn't let it ride, he might even go down|pg||
nt|othered1: East does have to help declarer in some way, but maybe east should have unblocked on first @D|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ralfwil: If E had unblocked S can see the @d split|pg||

pc|c6|pc|c7|pc|cA|pc|s2|pg||
nt|othered1: true, but if east had taken as much time at trick one as at trick four, east might have seen this coming and west might have save exit, say, in @D|pg||
nt|othered1: safe exit, rather|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s8|nt|april7: now E could be endplayed @H J would have been best|pg||
nt|vugraphzht: Rekunov (many times Russia open team) is very surpsised with this lead|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|april7: 1NT by S after 3 passes|pg||
mb|1H|mb|1N|nt|april7: wrong prediction|pg||
nt|april7: X by W and NS in trouble|pg||
nt|othered1: 1N is an interesting call without a stopper.  I don't quite understand it -- do EW systemically open very weak suits?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 2@C ok|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it is amazing how often the words "wrong" and "prediction" occur in close proximity |pg||
nt|mdgraham: agree Ed - particularly with double as a reasonable alternative (ok, not four spades)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: for me D is better than 1nt with only Q10 in @h. My partner must believe in a @h stopper|pg||
nt|othered1: but will north run over a double with a flat 5-count?|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sJ|nt|mmmakela: S can run w rdbl|pg||

nt|othered1: Does south have a weak 2@D available?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzht: no|pg||
nt|mmmakela: think 1 NT were ok if not dead minimum, here dbl clearly better|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|2C|nt|othered1: Ok, a weak 1@D then|pg||
nt|vugraphzht: 2@d is mini multi|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mmmakela: E wondering who has what|pg||
pc|d5|nt|april7: this bidding made it diffucult for EW reaching the 4@S contract|pg||

nt|lestergold: hi Mike from UK here|pg||
nt|vugraphzht: hi MIke|pg||
nt|mdgraham: NS appear to have been successful in shutting out the spade suit |pg||

nt|ralfwil: Why not D over 2@h?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: now missed ok 4 @S|pg||

nt|othered1: I was wondering how you stay out of game with north's hand when south opens that aggressively.  I guess you just don't|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: the light opener has ensured that they will play in game which does notlike like a chicken that will fight|pg||
nt|lestergold: m,aybe a trick on lead??|pg||
nt|henryb: If he escapes a @d lead this can make|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|mmmakela: on previous question is will E bid more than 3 @S on pd's dbl? I doubt it after both opps bid and singl club|pg||
nt|lestergold: easyt is endplaye at trick1 except in spades which he will never lead!!|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Now i think he will survive|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|othered1: I didn't expect 3N, though it looks like north chose to keep the @S support hidden, so south had no choice in the final contract|pg||

pc|h5|pc|hT|pc|h6|pg||
nt|ralfwil: too late now with a @d shift|pg||
nt|henryb: the @d10 would not help. Declarer covers, then ducks the @dJ return|pg||
nt|lestergold: now we are moving into overtrick territory- choice of 3N by north rather than 4s was very well judged|pg||
nt|april7: N could even play Q of @D and duck next @D makes also 9 tricks|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c2|pc|c3|pc|cT|pg||
nt|henryb: After the 3@c bid he had no ruffing value, and @s would produce tricks in NT as well as @s|pg||

nt|othered1: auction (and play) gave declarer enough clues to go right in @D|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But wasn´t 2nt by E a little bit risky? If partner has 2632|pg||
nt|henryb: given the hands that N-S open, S could have had a king less|pg||

mb|p|nt|henryb: judged well not to as 2H was cold|pg||
nt|othered1: without a *real* surprise for declarer, isn't it right to take out takeout doubles?|pg||
nt|henryb: I think so|pg||
nt|april7: 2NT will also not be cheap,but E will bid @C probably|pg||
nt|henryb: partner could easily be 2-4-4-3|pg||
nt|ralfwil: on lower levels, there is no doubles for penalty any longer - only takeout|pg||
nt|othered1: Here the 1@C opening gives east a problem, as there's no certainty that partner has enough @C to play at 3-level|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|hT|nt|mmmakela: 2 NT must show min, without Hx in spades(if they play suppdbls), now think E shd risk 3 @C|pg||
