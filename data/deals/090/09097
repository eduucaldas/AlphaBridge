mb|d|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: difficult decision for North now|pg||
nt|xenya: Your commentators are Mike Gold (UK), Ed Shapiro (USA), Bob Holl (The Netherlands) and Cornelia Yoder (USA). I am Vladimir Ivanov from Russia|pg||

nt|lestergold: at mps it would have been pretty clearcut double|pg||
pc|s9|nt|bobholl: now it is a "brave" pass|pg||
nt|werge: But after the bidding, N/S could not miss 3 NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: maybe it should have been double even at imps after all it isnt a double into game|pg||
nt|lestergold: 200 a nice score 500 notmour ofthe question|pg||
nt|lestergold: east/ west should get out for one off now|pg||
nt|lestergold: one dim to lose and a heart guess playing opener for the ace after north has shown up with plenty|pg||
nt|bobholl: but -2 good possible|pg||
nt|werge: Only if they continue to play...|pg||
nt|xenya: only if declarer ruffs with the A now|pg||

mb|1D|mb|1S|mb|3D|nt|lestergold: n/s can make 4s as cars lie|pg||
nt|xenya: yes they can|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6s i measnt to say|pg||
nt|xenya: hello :)|pg||
nt|xenya: sorry private|pg||
nt|lestergold: hjar to reach tho|pg||
nt|hausigel: North is wondering how many points are in the deck|pg||
nt|lestergold: need to identify the double fit with no losers in both majors|pg||
nt|hausigel: much too strong for an immediate spade raide|pg||
nt|vugraphzht: 3@d weak|pg||
nt|vugraphzht: preempt|pg||
nt|xenya: very weak|pg||
nt|vugraphzht: explanation was given|pg||
nt|hausigel: a simple 3@H seems right|pg||
nt|werge: Minimum|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4d north needs to b id but i dont see them reaching the cold 6|pg||
nt|lestergold: but trouible is east will barrage|pg||
nt|hausigel: East will jump to 5@C next, for a club lead against a @S contract|pg||
nt|lestergold: south will not get overly excited he has a bog standard vulnerable 1 level overcall|pg||
nt|xenya: and he might well do so|pg||
nt|lestergold: i predict n/s subsiding in 5S but ive been wrong before|pg||
nt|othered1: 5@DX|pg||
nt|hausigel: 5@S|pg||
nt|hausigel: but I see no good way to reach 6@S...|pg||
nt|hausigel: North is strong but has poor controls in minor suits|pg||
nt|hausigel: South has the controls, but few honors in the majors that warrant a slam|pg||
nt|werge: But a man bidding 1 @S vuln with NOTHING in majors - he mus control some minor|pg||
nt|xenya: 5@D should go 3 off it seems|pg||
nt|lestergold: this would be a difficult slam to reach without the opposition stealing most of the bidding spaxce|pg||
nt|xenya: i wonder who is thinking|pg||
nt|hausigel: specs say that South must have something for his (vuln) 1@S bid...|pg||
mb|5S|nt|werge: Not West|pg||
nt|hausigel: but he might have overcalled also without @CK|pg||
nt|lestergold: and east will go some with his massive shape east knows that n/s have sprobable slam even if n/s dont|pg||
nt|xenya: 5@S? Just like this?|pg||
mb|6C|nt|lestergold: well if 5s is invite i doubt it wuill be accpeted|pg||
mb|6D|nt|hausigel: I could imagine it asks for @D control|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well one prediciton of mine is right i said that east would go some!!!|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|nt|hausigel: and South shows first round control, in case North is looking for a grand|pg||
nt|chick: 5@S ask bid slam if can stop 2 fast losers in opp's suit|pg||
nt|othered1: and south, dutifully, showed the first round @D control|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: and east puished them into the frigid slam they couldnt bid it otherwise!!|pg||
nt|hausigel: nice piece of bidding|pg||
nt|othered1: I'd guess 6@D also implied @C control|pg||
nt|werge: N/S has played extremely well in this tournament|pg||
nt|lestergold: n/w seem to be leading charmed life|pg||
pc|d2|nt|hausigel: I dont think so. North asked for @D control, not for club holding|pg||
nt|othered1: Wouldn't passing 6@C show a @D control as well, so 6@D should show @C, too.|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
nt|lestergold: well not that i blame east but he helped south value that pesky K of clubs|pg||
nt|hausigel: you mean without @D control he would double ?|pg||
nt|othered1: Absolutely would double without @D control|pg||
nt|lestergold: he has to make this as there is only one line of play available|pg||

nt|vugraphzht: 3@s was explained "no agreements. natural, maybe invitational, maybe preemptive"|pg||
