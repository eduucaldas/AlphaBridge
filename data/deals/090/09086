mb|p|mb|p|nt|onebid: close, but no cigar|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1S|nt|bobh1: when E wins his @c, he must shift to a @s to break up the squeeze|pg||
nt|onebid: good spot Bob!|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|onebid: 3@C a bit conservative you think?|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|pelu: what would u bid Judy?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: prefer 2@S, as North is a passed hand |pg||
nt|bobh1: they must not play 3@c as weak|pg||
nt|onebid: 2@S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I would bid 2@S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think I have a limit raise in clubs|pg||
nt|mdgraham: imagine @SAxx  in North. Then 3NT is better played by South|pg||
nt|pelu: and what is 3@C = a limit raise in @C :)|pg||
nt|bobh1: perhaps 3@c shows a limit raise--that's the way they used to play in the old days|pg||
nt|onebid: in competition?|pg||
nt|pelu: :(|pg||
mb|4C|nt|mdgraham: yes, but clubs meant clubs then|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|onebid: kibs say in Russia, shows limit, so probably so|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|sK|pc|s4|pg||

nt|bobh1: kib has retracted his statement :)|pg||

pc|c7|pc|s2|pc|h2|nt|bobh1: I agree Peter, in fact many play that double of 3@s would be lead-deflecting|pg||

mb|2N|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: moot point as to whether to raise or not with the South hand|pg||

nt|onebid: yes, I agree|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|pelu: kibs say: @S 9 or 10 - lavinthal to high Suit|pg||
nt|bobh1: if the @d K is singleton, too bad|pg||
nt|pelu: then @S6 = play @C again|pg||
nt|onebid: East knows N likely has K@C and will figure out what they need to set|pg||
nt|mdgraham: agree - @S6 was a Humpty-Dumpty sort of signal - it means what I want it to mean |pg||

nt|Walddk2: In an ideal world doubler has 4 spades. The world is not ideal|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you have been asked to name our longest suit - why should a simple 2@D be five cards?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Kxx  xx  AQxx  AJxx   Are you passing over a 1@H opening?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3343 shape, for example  |pg||
nt|onebid: these are the problems that need to be discussed with your regular partner. But we don't play every session with a regular partner.|pg||
nt|pelu: u can easy find spec hand - but 9 out of 10 S has 4 card 1S - and my bid for sure 1@S - are u with me or Roland??|pg||
