nt|swanson: Hello from Southern California|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: this could be a frisky start to the set|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2D|nt|athene: 5@D might prove a profitable sac over 4@S|pg||
nt|swanson: N-S hold a lot of aces to be considering a sacrifice at the five level.|pg||

mb|4S|nt|vugraphzhp: look at page 3&4 for EW card.|pg||

pc|dK|pc|dQ|pc|d7|pc|d6|pg||
nt|athene: it certainly wasn't easy for NS to find this sacrifice|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C!|nt|jcomyn: competition here - who wins?|pg||
nt|cliveo: The Irish team have already built up a large lead; they are on 56 VPs after three matches, 9 VPs ahead of three teams in equal second, England A, England B and Northern Ireland. ...|pg||
nt|cliveo: Wales are not far behind on 43. So if Wales win they are back in the hunt. It's an important morning for them|pg||
nt|henryb: one of those hands that many nowadays open with 1N|pg||
nt|woozle: transfer openings?|pg||

nt|mariner1: Hi All and Welcome to the NTU Cup 2009 from Taipei. This is the 1st session of|pg||
nt|mariner1: the finals. The two teams are both from NTU.|pg||

nt|ahollan1: very close match with 12 boards to go --  but my bet is on BTU|pg||

nt|woozle: 4S NS is playable, and there are 5/6 honours onside making it cold|pg||
nt|xenya: i don't think so|pg||
nt|mariner1: no games here,,,,,,,|pg||
mb|4S|nt|vugraphzgj: sorry - sleeping|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 5-5 in clubs who cares any more?|pg||
nt|cliveo: As you can see, the Irish have an aggressive opening style|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and 4-4 in D by opps|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 5-4|pg||
mb|p|nt|cliveo: Which makes it difficult for them to find their 5-5 club fit|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and us ordinary mortals go 1S-1Nt-2C and bops your uncle|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: a conservative pass by N|pg||
nt|mariner1: hi Al :)|pg||
nt|woozle: of course, NS didn't even think about such a foolish game|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: Not so conservative when partner's range is 14-16|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we're at it again, aye Rob|pg||
nt|mariner1: not a lot of action expected on this board.|pg||
nt|woozle: might make 5 if East doesn't return a diamond|pg||
nt|mariner1: take that back, 4@H has play|pg||
nt|mariner1: not that they will be in game ever here|pg||
nt|xenya: cold actually?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|cliveo: exactly|pg||
nt|jcomyn: oh well what would we know|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d7|pc|d6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't think i've Moscito from anyone other than Pan Asian players [including Australia & New Zealand]|pg||
pc|cA|nt|cliveo: Although in a 6-1 fit, and the suit breaking 4-2, Garvey can make this contract if he plays on hearts or clubs|pg||
nt|cliveo: So far so good|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c9|nt|ahollan1: @C6 just too hard to read|pg||
pc|cT|pg||

nt|mariner1: do we know if we have the same MOSCITO pair back?|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s9|pc|s3|nt|jcomyn: better not to ruff|pg||
nt|cliveo: At this stage it seems to make little difference whether or not Rees ruffs|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|nt|ahollan1: oops -- names being changed now|pg||
nt|xenya: both pairs playing Moscito here?|pg||

mb|d|nt|athene: certainly E-W wouldn't have been considering the 5-level on that hand|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|panja: I suspect EW can make 10 tricks in @H here..|pg||
nt|swanson: 4@H will probably make on this layout after a high spade lead by South.|pg||
nt|athene: that south hand is a 1@S overcall for most people these days|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|roswolf: e/w are playing basically a std natural system but in some positions they play a mini 10-12 NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|swanson: Quite a view by East in passing the heart raise.|pg||
nt|roswolf: agreed|pg||
nt|vugraphzhp: 2@h alerted, but explanation is written in Chinese:(|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps they had a misunderstanding|pg||
nt|athene: and 2@H over the double actually showed a really bad hand|pg||
nt|athene: and west forgot the system|pg||
pc|sA|nt|panja: 2@H after the double might be a tad weaker|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|pc|h4|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2@H probably constructive|pg||
nt|panja: now..@HQKA, and then @CQK and small|pg||
nt|vugraphzhp: "2@h = unwilling to compete further" written E to N.|pg||
nt|roswolf: ty for info - wrong again:(|pg||
nt|swanson: If 2@H shows an awful hand it would seem to me that East would want to try a preemptive re-raise.|pg||
nt|athene: we might see clubs played first|pg||
nt|roswolf: but that explanation is quite a mis-statement of west's hand|pg||
nt|panja: E is unlikely to give only two Clubs to South...so discarding @D early might not seem like a good option for him...as against that @HQ, if it loses, could lead to fast defeat..or ...|pg||
nt|panja: would it not?|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c2|pc|cQ|pc|c4|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s2|pc|d6|pc|sK|pg||
nt|panja: that is a good way to proceed....discarding a @D on @S|pg||
nt|panja: keeping North out in the process ...will South open @D?|pg||
nt|swanson: South might as well lead another spade.|pg||
pc|s4|nt|Walddk2: The Chinese ladies bid to 4@H in the closed room|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s9|pc|d9|pg||
pc|c7|nt|panja: in this situation, on the @SQ....North could have played @S9 to signal @DK..|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cA|pc|c5|pg||
nt|athene: east only loses a trump and a diamond from here|pg||
nt|panja: now that a Diamond has been discarded, @HQ must be the right continuation|pg||
nt|athene: so a gain for China, if the play follows a similar course in the other room|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|d8|pg||
nt|swanson: East is trying to allow for North holding four good hearts - quite likely on the auction.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Declarer went wrong in the endgame|pg||
pc|sT|nt|athene: the first tricks were identical|pg||
pc|s6|nt|athene: but declarer then cashed the @HA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: She had played it to perfection until trick 8|pg||
nt|Walddk2: @HA was OK but another heart was not|pg||
pc|d5|pc|h6|pg||
nt|athene: south overcalled 1@S, rather than doubling, as expected|pg||
nt|athene: but that meant declarer couldn't place the high cards with such certainty|pg||
pc|c3|pc|hT|nt|panja: looks like Furuta is trying to guard against a 4-1 trump break|pg||
nt|swanson: This is a much eaiser hand to play looking at all the cards.|pg||
pc|s7|nt|roswolf: as ever|pg||
pc|c9|pg||

nt|cliveo: Well done. So though Ireland were in an inferior contract to Wales it has only cost them 1 IMP|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think moscito would have opened East 1N -- so probably back to 2/1 pairs |pg||
nt|mariner1: Vlad we had MOSCITO pair here last session, do not know now|pg||

mb|1H|nt|phil_20686: Good morning Everyone|pg||
nt|cliveo: This time points evenly divided, looks like a heart spade battle|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hah - I beat Kieran to the follow-up|pg||
nt|woozle: anybody's partscore here -EW in clubs or maybe hearts; NS in diamonds or maybe spades|pg||

nt|henryb: 1@d P 1N 2@s?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|cliveo: Good morning everyone|pg||
nt|henryb: no, weak NT and some sort of @c out|pg||
nt|woozle: is 3C weak?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on NZ pair in Beijing played 2-under transfers with other things looking Moscito like|pg||
nt|mariner1: in Oz,,,,,,, my typing is horrible these days|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S makes..... and even 6@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D!|nt|Walddk4: Good morning David, Phil and Clive|pg||
nt|ady: good morning|pg||
nt|woozle: that might silence everybody|pg||
nt|mariner1: even 7@S|pg||
nt|mariner1: ruff out 2@D and claim|pg||
nt|ahollan1: I sure hope 2@H is transfer showing contructive @S raise or better|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: mm both thought of bidding|pg||
mb|3N|nt|jcomyn: hi all|pg||
nt|cliveo: However, Kurbalija stopped the spades being introduced|pg||
nt|woozle: or not...3D is an interesting effort|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: probably about down one|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i must say -- 1@D was flawless|pg||
nt|woozle: 3D might get some partscores right, but it carries big risks, like missing spade games|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but even if it does - this doesn't look like best way to start describing the hand|pg||
mb|4H|nt|jcomyn: ok|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Hi Sharyn and John|pg||
nt|sharynr: hey Roland and John :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hi Shariyn|pg||
nt|vugraphzgj: having a few connections problems.  Going to try taking computer back into room now it is connected!!|pg||
nt|sharynr: John, would you have bid over 2D?|pg||
nt|sharynr: with the south hand, that is /|pg||
nt|jcomyn: plenty of hcp but distribution not helpful|pg||
nt|sharynr: I agree|pg||
nt|jcomyn: depends on partner. Not sure|pg||
nt|jcomyn: keep attacking trumps|pg||
nt|sharynr: well the "math" seems to lean toward passing...since the most you can expect is a bad 9 from pard|pg||
nt|sharynr: I wonder if there is still a connection problem|pg||
nt|jcomyn: looks likely|pg||
nt|henryb: this should be 2 down|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes it does seem an unusual call|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil_20686: Al together too early for bridge IMO, alarm felt awfully early this morning :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Forrester - Bakhshi  E-W  for England|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S  the limit|pg||
nt|cliveo: Both teams had a poor start yesterday, England losing 17-13 to their B team and Scotland 25-3 to the Republic of Ireland|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Adamson - Martin   N-S  for Scotland|pg||
nt|mariner1: can they find the nice slam here?|pg||
mb|p|nt|cliveo: Interestingly, both England and Scotland run trials to select their teams, and have not had a good result in the Camrose for some years with this method, whereas the Republic of ...|pg||
nt|cliveo: Ireland have picked the same team year in, year out, and have not been beaten for some years|pg||
nt|vugraphzgj: connection problems :(|pg||
nt|cliveo: You will find that every year, the composition of the English and Scottish teams is totally different from the previous year|pg||
nt|cliveo: Indeed, England won the silver medal at the Beijing Mind Games and yet only one pair from that team is playing this weekend|pg||
nt|jcomyn: club|pg||
nt|woozle: pass would have likely scored +50 - diamond lead, spade switch|pg||
nt|mariner1: so 2@H had to have been @S support|pg||
nt|ahollan1: without knowing all the NS agreements -- this sequence sounds like 3@D=game try|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm just assuming transfer responses over the Takeout DBL|pg||
nt|mariner1: I like the 2@H treatment here....|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i like it for game investigation, but looks cumbersome for slam invite|pg||
nt|ahollan1: North doesn't know if jump was because of @D honors - or shortness|pg||
mb|p|nt|cliveo: If Garvey wins and switches to a club this should go one off|pg||
nt|sga1: No looks -1|pg||
pc|sA|nt|cliveo: Adamson-Martin are one of the top lady Scottish pairs, and have done very well to win their place. The Scots, in fact, have three ladies in their team as Liz McGowan is playing ...|pg||
nt|cliveo: with David Liggatt|pg||
pc|s3|nt|phil_20686: It has always been my feeling that straight teams trials will seldom produce the best team|pg||
nt|ady: the hearts in the South hand are not strong enough to win twice  otherwise 4@S could go down|pg||
pc|s5|pc|h4|pg||
nt|sga1: sry u r right|pg||
nt|henryb: 3@c, 2@h and a @d|pg||
nt|sga1: Not any more|pg||
nt|woozle: now maybe club, club, third club for the trump demotion|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what is bug's option?   Neg DBL -- but no rebid after 3@H, PASS hoping for reopening double - then ?3@S?|pg||
nt|woozle: I'd pass, then 4S|pg||
pc|c6|nt|jcomyn: and one off|pg||
nt|henryb: but now may make|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@H must be 1st or 2nd round control - and very discouraging for North - who now knows 4@S was based upon @D shortness rather than honors|pg||
nt|mariner1: does S see slam now?|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cQ|nt|Walddk4: what about a trump lead?|pg||
nt|xenya: i don't see how S could bid slam, aceless|pg||
nt|mariner1:  this board could be a big key in match,,,,, since 6 and 7 also make if bid|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|cliveo: I agree with Phil|pg||
nt|Walddk4: That would be very inconvenient for declarer|pg||
nt|ahollan1: welcome to no-man's land  2   [ 1=2N,  2=5Major,  3=3Major,  4=4minor]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Hsiangwen hears an auction that screams for a trump lead and does so -- then looks at the rest of his hand|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mariner1: trump lead as good as any here........ he looks Zugzwang on the opening lead|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ady: Forester m  ust be carefull to p lay 8@H 2nd time if playing from hand|pg||
nt|phil_20686: does not matter, North has no smaller ones left in any event|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but doesnt 4S make|pg||
nt|henryb: will in fact|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now we know double dummy that declarer can take all the tricks -- but at Imps -- first find line to ensure 11 tricks|pg||
nt|mariner1: he heard the @H cue so no @H and @c nor @D looks attractive|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mariner1: 1st mistake would be assuming you have 4 @c tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or even 2 :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: true|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|ady: does not matter as AJ109 now in north hand|pg||
nt|cliveo: Some people might think this defence is routine, but time after time the Irish are so accurate in these situations|pg||
pc|s4|nt|xenya: actually it's not a great slam, looking at NS's hands|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s9|nt|ahollan1: and as here -- how do you feel if 3@C all pass?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: point for the audience -- sometimes preempts make bidding tough|pg||
nt|woozle: 3C all pass is fine - you're facing club length and probably make nothing|pg||
nt|woozle: A crossruff probably falls into 9 tricks here|pg||
nt|woozle: although West's diamond 8 may be a problem on the fourth round of hearts|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|phil_20686: North should probably have played one of the JT9 as a matter of technique on teh first round of hearts, but a minor slip|pg||

nt|panja: and fit...9 for EW..two 8-card fit for NS|pg||

nt|swanson: N-S can make 3@S I believe.  North should bid here.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|h2|nt|roswolf: no good judgment - as always:)|pg||
nt|athene: north's decision mainly depends on how likely opps are to have as many hearts as they should (i.e. 9)|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hK|nt|panja: South's double was the key..it is a little risky, no doubt, but it seems to have won the board here|pg||

nt|cliveo: In the other room, 4@s was doubled, making an overtrick - first blood to Wales|pg||
nt|henryb: harder to reach after a 14-16 1N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hmm - i thought should have been an overtrick - so it goes|pg||
mb|2H|nt|sharynr: NS stopped low enough, East must have been disappointed in the closed room, defending 2@H with an overtrick|pg||
nt|mariner1: he pitched @D on @S and when @c were 4 - 1 he lost a @c and a @H|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: reverse the vulnerability and I'm bidding forcing NT with North hand|pg||
mb|r|nt|cliveo: I believe Forrester is the most capped English player in the Camrose series. When I was in my 20s and lived in Wakefield I had the pleasure of playing with Tony on a Monday and ...|pg||
nt|cliveo: Brian Senior on a Tuesday, and have lived to tell of the experience!|pg||
nt|henryb: what do these people play is 1N-2@s|pg||
nt|sga1: yes. May play 3@d|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S has good play here.......|pg||
nt|by: note that N, E, and W are three of taiwan's U26 team that made it to the semis 2008 in beijing, S is W's old partner who place 3rd with him in bandung 2007 PABF U26|pg||
nt|woozle: very good play once the heart ace is onside|pg||
mb|2S|nt|jcomyn: here we go early on a 9-count|pg||
nt|cliveo: John, can you tell us where Garvey and Carroll are based, and whether they play in competitions together outside of internationals?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: still should have been 1 diamond left to dispose of round loser :(|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil_20686: How close do the panel think this is to a 3@c bid?|pg||
mb|p|nt|cliveo: Once again the aggressive tactics of the Irish have kept the Welsh out of the bidding, though the Welsh have 24 points and a probable heart game|pg||
mb|3H|nt|phil_20686: Feels close to me, the Kx@s looks like a big holding now|pg||
nt|ady: 6 NT  or 6@C   or 6@S all make    not 6@D|pg||
nt|cliveo: We all know how fine a player Tony is, but he is a particularly strong declarer|pg||
nt|ady: there is a danger of 6@D here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I don't think so|pg||
nt|ady: if Martin gets diamond preference   he might back peddle with a jack high suit|pg||
nt|phil_20686: North will offer 6@c as a matter of course, almost irrespective of how the auction develops|pg||
nt|henryb: 5@d is also reasonable|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i like the 3-card @S raise|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Kieran wins the cupie doll -- i hoped someone would mention 1@C with balanced and transfer responses|pg||
nt|woozle: I usually play 2NT after 1x-1y:2y as a 1-round force, after which 3 card raises bid out shape|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N is overbid - punishes partner for opening sub-strength distrbutional hands|pg||
nt|mariner1: my guess is he played out all the trumps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but reopening DBL with that @H holding is .... non-optimal|pg||
mb|3S|nt|jcomyn: yes TG is in England and JC works in Dublin. No they dont play too often outside internationals. In fact John won the Irish Masters playing with Adam Mesbur|pg||
nt|ahollan1: have any of you played the follow-up to determine if opener has made 3 or 4 card raise?|pg||
nt|woozle: my style rebids 1NT (or opens 1C and plays transfer responses) - I like the raise to suggest four so that partner can jump to game more often|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: N-S are women   Sheila - Anne|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: Q@H is an imaginative lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure anybody follows this anymore, but I learned bidding after reopening DBL to first subtract a King, then bid accordingly|pg||
mb|p|nt|cliveo: I think it unlikely they will bid a slam as with the first set yesterday evening, the cards do lie well for declarer|pg||
nt|phil_20686: (provided only that they get to the 6 level)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hmm -- i hadn't seen the 1 round force treatment before |pg||
nt|ahollan1: duh -- 2N as 1-round force|pg||
nt|mariner1: I like to play 2@C asking over a major, outlawed by ACBL until recently|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that makes West a solid 1N bid|pg||
nt|mariner1: p did bid them so reasonable..... and N has no entry|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mariner1: sort of like drury in but also in 1st and 2nd seat|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Rob -- you mean like Gazzilli?|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hK|pc|h5|pg||
nt|ady: now South should get the message and if going to the 6 level  clubs rather than diamonds|pg||
nt|cliveo: what do we make of the 3@d bid - agreeing the suit, or a cue-bid? or even something else?|pg||
nt|mariner1: no|pg||
nt|woozle: 4S now has an overtrick on the menu|pg||
pc|c7|nt|phil_20686: This hand shows the powed of the mixed cue, the k@c is such a big card in the north hand, Many club players still play cues as ace showing, which is inferior|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's natural where I come from|pg||
nt|phil_20686: she just showed a GF raise in diamonds|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sga1: They r playing 2@s as Baron.|pg||
nt|sga1: I mean 1N - 2@s|pg||
pc|c4|nt|henryb: declarer should actually play a second high heart, then @cA and a @c. |pg||
nt|mariner1: he has time to setup the @c for 2 tricks now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: at this vulnerability - with that @H holding, East knows that West does not have strong hand hoping to defend, so pass and defend well for 100 a trick is much better plan|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|sT|nt|phil_20686: could even be 4@d depending on their agreement for inverted minors|pg||
nt|phil_20686: and that pass was unexpected|pg||
nt|cliveo: Well that shows how much we understood of their sequence!|pg||
nt|cliveo: Perhaps the key is that 4@c was not alerted, whereas 2@h, 3@s, 4@h and 4@s all were|pg||
nt|phil_20686: Pass is clearly anti-system, after that many cue bids, but south is worred about her poor diamonds, and opted to get out in a positive|pg||
nt|ady: crouch & Liggins in 6@D   swing for Scotland |pg||
pc|s5|pc|s3|pc|sK|pg||

nt|woozle: check the club layout|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mariner1: its more like drury..... 2 @c says I have at limit raise, a 2N invitational hand, 3 in a|pg||
nt|mariner1: minor invitational bid or ANY game forcing hand........ over a major and unpassed|pg||
nt|mariner1: hand opposite|pg||

nt|cliveo: Indeed, in the open room the Welsh pair did not bid and the Irish pair are playing in 4@h|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|cliveo: So interestingly, only the Irish players have bid on this hand|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: don't be surprised if +150 loses a couple of imps [compared to 1@H going down 2 or 3]|pg||
mb|1C|nt|henryb: can they avoid a really silly game?|pg||

mb|1D|nt|ady: part score in diamonds   |pg||
nt|cliveo: to return to the question of selection, and I know how difficult it is because I was chairman of a rugby selection committee for over 5 years, there has been a lack of consistency ...|pg||
nt|cliveo: in the selection of the England teams. For example Bell and Byrne were not selected for the U28 team in Beijing, and yet have been selected for the England B open team, where ...|pg||
nt|cliveo: indeed they showed their ability yesterday with a very good first 16 boards against the A team|pg||
nt|jcomyn: these tactics won buckets of imps against Scotland - or is it bouquets of imps|pg||
nt|cliveo: Again, they have 24 points between them, but this time Rees was able to get into the action before the Irish had a chance!|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: @c good lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wow - red vs white, 2.5+ cover cards -- i think i'd try 4@S|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|ady: 3 @D limit|pg||
nt|jcomyn: Spelt Filip I believe sorry about that|pg||
nt|cliveo: Don't worry, there are very few Welsh speakers about|pg||
nt|woozle: 2h rebid is 4 hearts, longer clubs?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Bo -- can you translate?|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil_20686: Do we know what these bids mean?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: gone crazy again|pg||
nt|sga1: Yes. they may play 3@d.|pg||
nt|mariner1: now S in a spot|pg||
nt|xenya: i certainly would |pg||
nt|mariner1: yes 4 @S looks reasonable to me too......|pg||
nt|ahollan1: declarer much better off if he knows about the @C10 lead - i.e. can it be from interior sequence or not|pg||
nt|ahollan1: IF possibly interior sequence, @C6 would have been good shot -- 2 minutes ago|pg||
mb|p|nt|cliveo: The bidding sequences of our top players are so different to the sequences played at our local clubs that it is very difficult for aspiring players to learn from the experts|pg||
nt|mariner1: @D lead here makes this tough|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|woozle: then 3C 2425?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ady: 1@H  re-bid shows spades I think|pg||
nt|henryb: harder if you play 2/1 gf. but then you respond 1N|pg||
nt|sga1: yes.|pg||
pc|s8|nt|cliveo: I agree, otherwise the sequence makes no sense|pg||
nt|phil_20686: I have always found it easy - just ask, top players are normally happy to help, and they all played natural systems once|pg||
nt|jcomyn: will they find it again?|pg||
nt|cliveo: If the Irish keep up their impressive form on defence, this contract will be 1 off after the first four tricks|pg||
nt|jcomyn: Tommy may lead a S however|pg||
nt|cliveo: And as we can see, Ireland got 11 IMPs back on Board 3 through the aggressive tactics of Garvey and Carroll in this room|pg||
nt|vugraphzgj: Carroll tried to lead OOT but Rees stopped him :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: sure he did before CJ hit the table|pg||
nt|vugraphzgj: exactly|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|jcomyn: which Ace is the problem|pg||
nt|jcomyn: looking for a signal|pg||

nt|jcomyn: quick arent they|pg||

nt|jcomyn: H3 may ask for a Club - dont know|pg||

nt|jcomyn: perhaps|pg||

nt|jcomyn: process of elimination|pg||
nt|cliveo: According to the convention card, a high card is discouraging|pg||
nt|cliveo: Convention cards for all the pairs playing this weekend can be found at http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2007/camroseteams.htm|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ahhh -- non-transfer moscito|pg||
nt|woozle: West has plenty of controls, maybe 3H showed a min|pg||
nt|ahollan1: of all the red suits -- that @H3 and @HQ were the only ones NOT worth consideration|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|ady: 3@D  was a bit pushy on such a tepid suit   |pg||
nt|ahollan1: Kieran - are you a Mosciot convert?|pg||
pc|h7|nt|sga1: on a trump lead and continuation, real problem for declarer.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or even Moscito|pg||
nt|woozle: No, but I have played relay before|pg||
nt|woozle: looks fairly vanilla|pg||
nt|ahollan1: are these basically Symmetric Relay based?|pg||
nt|woozle: looks like symmetric|pg||
pc|h3|nt|jcomyn: oh dear he let me down|pg||
pc|h6|nt|woozle: Not sure about the last two bids by West though - he's loaded with controls, I would have thought he'd be taking up more steps|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|dA|nt|henryb: now a @h towards dummy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: while bidding continues - my favorite relay story -- 1st hand of 2007 Reisinger, kibitzing Burgess-Marston|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they used ALL bids between 1@C and 2N -- BOTH opponents ran out of PASS cards|pg||
pc|d7|nt|Walddk4: Good morning to Jim Hay from Scotland|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ahh: morning everyone |pg||
nt|woozle: My favourite, B-M again, is where they relayed to the five level without skipping a step. At that point, Burgess realised that they were both relaying, figured out what he'd shown ...|pg||
nt|woozle: and what Marston needed to keep bidding for so long, and placed the contract correctly|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|henryb: should have pitched @c|pg||
nt|ahollan1: more than bidding accuracy, relay may gain more just on increasing blind opening lead syndrome|pg||
pc|d9|nt|xenya: claim 11|pg||
pc|dK|nt|cliveo: Good morning, Jim. Has the sun risen in Aberdeen yet?|pg||
nt|ady: good morning|pg||

nt|cliveo: their results|pg||
pc|d6|pc|c4|nt|woozle: It's often inferior when the replier has extra playing strength, or when the described hand is going to be declarer|pg||
pc|d2|nt|cliveo: there are obviously a lot of good people in Scotland then|pg||
nt|ahh: pleased to see our debut girls holding their own against   Englands strike  pair |pg||
nt|cliveo: unfortunately Jim, the 11 IMPs were due to an error by the English at the other table|pg||
nt|ahh: they bid the wrong slam |pg||

nt|woozle: Usual theory is to lead dummy's three card suit...leading dummy's short suits against 3NT is always doomed|pg||

nt|athene: assuming declarer loses a tempo with a diamond, trying to reach dummy to lead a heart through the @HAx|pg||

nt|athene: in the other room the heart lead made things very easy for declarer|pg||
nt|panja: there is an interesting issue here...South has no wasted values in @D opposite a stiff @D...who out of NS is in a better position to judge? S judging north's shortness, or N ...|pg||
nt|panja: judging South's non-wasted values?|pg||

nt|mariner1: on14 they only bid to 4@S in Open so no big swing,,,,, maybe an imp or 2|pg||
mb|2H|nt|Walddk4: 2@D presumably intermediate|pg||
nt|woozle: although 3NT may appeal to East, and it dies a quick death if fruitman finds a big heart|pg||
mb|3D|nt|sharynr: I guess NS play sound overcalls|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: 5@D is pretty good|pg||
nt|cliveo: how would you rate the 3NT by Sime-Matheson on board 4?|pg||
nt|ahh: is that a weak strong jump or a strong weak jump ?|pg||
nt|sharynr: and NS did wel to score plus here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in [more] obnoxious days -- we would have described 2@S as "showing the values for a 2@S bid in this sequence"|pg||
nt|mariner1: he may cash a @H to look I would|pg||
nt|woozle: AKx often a great lead against 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: boy oh boy|pg||
nt|cliveo: Surely Kurbalija hasn't passed here?|pg||
mb|3H|nt|cliveo: yesterday, Townsend-Gold described their jumps as 'strongish', but they had 13 points|pg||
nt|cliveo: At my club even the LOLs would be jumping on the table|pg||
nt|cliveo: OK, that makes more sense|pg||
nt|sga1: Only 2@c makes for NS.|pg||
nt|henryb: and Wast will rescue North|pg||
nt|sga1: He did.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahh: hopefully better than the 1st board they played yesterday |pg||
nt|sga1: With a ratchet suit, he bids again after doubling.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S looks like automatic response to me -- but if you take away a King, then bypass the suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahh: 3nt -3|pg||
nt|Walddk4: why?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: oh, not this one|pg||
nt|ahh: ok it was  just only -2 |pg||
nt|phil_20686: I think openeing Sime's hand with that suit is poor|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 3NT is an awful contract, but it makes|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You actually need spades 6-3 with no entry to the long suit|pg||
nt|cliveo: does it definitely make on a @s lead?|pg||
nt|phil_20686: or the @d finesse working|pg||
nt|phil_20686: but that is anti-% given the bidding|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Right Clive, North can switch to hearts after 2 rounds of spades|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But will that happen?|pg||
nt|woozle: Big missed opportunity for NS|pg||
nt|xenya: 12 tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: move a small @C from declarer's hand to smal @S -- and 4@S is much better contract than 4@H|pg||
nt|mariner1: I suspect 11 :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|cliveo: A kibbitzer has suggested two rounds of @s and a @h switch defeats the contract|pg||
pc|h2|nt|cliveo: Yes, it is easier in double dummy!|pg||
nt|cliveo: If Garvey makes all the right guesses, this is a good vulnerable save against a making non-vulnerable game|pg||
nt|vugraphzgj: sorry thought I had clicked on X but must have been slightly off|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mariner1: so now he makes extras|pg||
nt|ahollan1: here -- the long/strong trump suit it getting tapped|pg||
pc|hA|nt|phil_20686: He would be absolutely correct, but could be letting it through if east has Kxx@Hrather than Kx|pg||
nt|ahh: well for sure this start will not beat it |pg||
nt|mariner1: on 14 4@S only made 4@S so Mixed won an important imp|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but all roads would lead to 4@H so - i'll defer to Vlad and Rob to examine the play|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|woozle: 11 tricks, unless he gets greedy and tries to endplay South|pg||
pc|s3|nt|cliveo: I have to say, I find this quite remarkable. It is well outside my ability range to find this sacrifice|pg||
nt|henryb: He may be forced at the two level after doubling. I would be|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|nt|ahh: reasonable with no entries to try and help partner beat it |pg||
nt|phil_20686: i think a @c is what i would have led on this auction|pg||
nt|jcomyn: thats their style clive|pg||
nt|cliveo: Mind you, he still has to get the diamond and heart position correct|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jcomyn: oops|pg||
nt|cliveo: Now the methods have cost them. But not much, unless he gets the hearts wrong as well|pg||
pc|h4|nt|xenya: not much to examine here|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hT|pg||
pc|h9|nt|cliveo: In fact, we can see that the Irish pair bid to 6@c going one off, so this is going to be a bad board for Ireland whatever happens|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|cliveo: you are not an advocate of fourth highest of your longest and strongest suit, then?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3 imps with 8 to play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 10 to compare|pg||
pc|hK|nt|sga1: I mean for West. He need not have bid.|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cT|nt|xenya: declarer can't help making 6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and everything right for declarer|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: as far as black Q location - but not in suit split - so lose a black card or let west score trump |pg||
nt|mariner1: beginning to look like 12,,,,,,,, if so Vlad buys the beer!|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|nt|ahollan1: belay that -- club spots are right so no loser there|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but Cheng should play @CQ on 2nd round of the suit if holding was Q106 or Q6|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|phil_20686: looks normal, @s is a reasonable alternative, but like you say with no entry its not appetising. Then again, after the failure to double 3@c, perhaps a spade lead would apeal|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
mb|1N|nt|Walddk2: All about hearts here, and there is no reason why declarer should play against the odds|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|athene: a diamond lead will give a spade pitch|pg||
nt|roswolf: except they are behind in the match|pg||
nt|swanson: It's possible South could guess hearts here, trying to drop the doubleton queen after East fails to cover the jack lead from dummy.|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: small diamond lead, duck in dummy|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: good point|pg||
nt|panja: the other issue is whether W should cover @DJ...say after a @C lead to @CK|pg||
nt|athene: then just lose trump, spade, diamond|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You mean if they don't cover they don't have it, John?|pg||
pc|c5|nt|Walddk2: A famous Zia quote|pg||

nt|jcomyn: Howya Ciaran|pg||
nt|sharynr: hopefully we will see some bridge soon|pg||
nt|jcomyn: Dublin|pg||
nt|cliveo: In fact the last undertrick only cost 2 IMPs because of the result in the open room|pg||
nt|jcomyn: when he isnt off playing poker somewhere|pg||
nt|vugraphzgj: Garvey is shaking his head|pg||
nt|woozle: big double-fit hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i have some descriptions of the line -- weird is one with acceptable letter count|pg||
mb|p|nt|cliveo: In the open room, Board 5, they are playing in 3@d, so another swing to England|pg||
nt|woozle: NS make 3C or maybe 3S...EW make 11 tricks in either red suit|pg||
mb|1H|nt|mariner1: 2@H Micheals now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the downside of Michaels -- North doesn't know - and in fact doubts there is a @C fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: excerllent slam here|pg||
nt|henryb: double by N?|pg||
nt|mariner1: EW can make 4@H....|pg||
nt|woozle: I'm not much of a fan of this style of Michaels - I'd have no idea whether to take another bid. 1S leaves you with much better information about your partner's hand|pg||
nt|mariner1: even 5@H|pg||
mb|1S!|nt|cliveo: It does show that with modern technology pairs can be very effective even though they live significant travelling distances from each other|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes they do a fair bit of work on the internet - the whole teram doers|pg||
nt|cliveo: We can see the Welsh pair got a good result in the open room|pg||
nt|jcomyn: team does|pg||
nt|woozle: 2S: Anything you can cue I can cue better|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahh: if you always made the best opening lead  you would be worlds number 1 player for sure |pg||
nt|cliveo: Their international results show that hard work pays dividends, too|pg||
nt|jcomyn: not if 6H is bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Italians use Ghestem -- where they would show the 2 specific suits in one bid [but don't ask me which]|pg||
mb|3H|nt|jcomyn: same start in open room|pg||
nt|woozle: Going fancy could cost a bit - 4H would have probably bought it; 3D might let North back in|pg||
mb|p|nt|cliveo: At the moment, when Bakhshi-Forrester play in a game, Sime-Matheson play in a part score, and vice versa|pg||
nt|cliveo: With any other pair, one would say highly unlikely. But with the way Garvey and Carroll have bid so far this session, who knows?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 5s pushes them to 6H|pg||
nt|cliveo: Rees may live to regret his bid|pg||
nt|henryb: no. we seem to be in the business of rescuing the opponents when they are in trouble|pg||
nt|sga1: He preferred 2@h|pg||
mb|4H|nt|sga1: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: and finish|pg||
nt|sharynr: and he buys very well!|pg||
nt|cliveo: Although, 6@s is a good save over 6@h :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: unless dbl of course|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahh: this could have been sneaky 3nt on @S lead |pg||
nt|cliveo: we have a player in the north east called Bill March. If you ever find a lead other than fourth highest of your longest and strongest against 3NT you get many congratulations!|pg||
nt|ahh: but on non @S lead not so hot |pg||
nt|mariner1: I would bid a game as W|pg||
nt|ahollan1: endplayed at trick 1 :(|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: oops again|pg||
nt|cliveo: A lot of IMPs depend on Carroll's next bid|pg||
nt|mariner1: EW have 3N here no problem.. number of tricks only issue|pg||
nt|xenya: i can see 10|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|jcomyn: this is not good at all|pg||
nt|cliveo: And unfortunately for Ireland, in the negative column|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mariner1: Zugzwang on the lead again :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Paul Marston would say - lead @H instead of @S -- Canape Leads - very interesting article from way back in last millenium|pg||
pc|s4|nt|woozle: how could he know that his diamond honours are working... maybe there's some kind of clue|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this a lotta imps|pg||
nt|jcomyn: TG will be shaking his head again|pg||
nt|cliveo: A club from Garvey takes the contract two off|pg||
nt|cliveo: Provided Carroll then plays a diamond to the Ace and there is a second club ruff|pg||
pc|s9|nt|mariner1: only a @c continuation allows 6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: looks as thought West would have bid 2@S over 2@H or 1@S|pg||
nt|woozle: 2H over 1S might work as an asking bid - asking the opponents how many spades your partner has|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pc|s2|pg||
nt|cliveo: Not surprisingly, he played the Ace of diamonds first. Now will he find the club?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: he better|pg||
nt|cliveo: If he does, they lose 12 IMPs. If he doesn't, 17|pg||
nt|cliveo: Assuming, of course, my maths is correct!|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h5|nt|jcomyn: 17 it is|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|nt|athene: north won't stop out of slam now|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: perhaps she was worried that 2@C from opener in her long suit reduced her offensive potential|pg||
nt|panja: natural or 17+HCP, any hand, a nice structure|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|athene: 2@C is either natural or 17+; either of those makes a bid on south's hand less attractive|pg||
nt|Walddk2: KNown as Gazzilli|pg||
pc|s4|nt|athene: but i would still double 2@H in spite of that|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sK|pg||
nt|swanson: Less attractive, but double is still better than giving in to 2@H in my view.|pg||
nt|panja: again, this South hand is very similar to hand 35....S doubled there...|pg||

nt|athene: declarer has seen 10 hcp in south's hand|pg||
nt|athene: might decide to play for @HQ off|pg||
nt|roswolf: however the ladies have no momentum |pg||
nt|athene: but i don't think the presence of @HQxx in south's hand would be any incentive to bid|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If China lose this match, I hope it will be more than by 28 IMPs. Specs who were here in the first segment know what I mean|pg||

nt|mariner1: thanks Kieran|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well done on both sides|pg||
nt|xenya: provided he had one of course|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|phil_20686: they could do with some cheering up after yesterdays match :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: some hands we have this morning|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nite Kieran|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS have 3N if they get there|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@H bid with Qxx would have been weird|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharynr: will not most likely take @S and @h finesses ?|pg||
nt|cliveo: Denning/Shields will have been disappointed to have missed the slam as they are usually accurate on this type of hand|pg||
nt|henryb: wierd!|pg||
nt|sga1: I was saying for Board 7.|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|ahh: quite happy sniping from the side lines and helping our juniors |pg||
nt|cliveo: After all the excitement of the past boards, this looks like a routine 4@s contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzgj: they've been great hands all weekend|pg||
nt|henryb: I know|pg||
nt|sga1: ok|pg||
nt|xenya: true but might happen|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|sga1: 6@s may be bid by East in competition.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mariner1: time for 3N|pg||
nt|mariner1: on 16 3@S here they bid 4 @S in Open...... made 5 here|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharynr: playing for a heart diamond squeeze would do it, yes|pg||
nt|ciaran: probably cashed out and made 12 when @HQ dropped|pg||
nt|sga1: N may have realised and passed 5@s.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: checkback?   blast 4@H |pg||
pc|h4|nt|jcomyn: true although the first half of Ireland v EBU hands were dull enough|pg||
nt|cliveo: Yes, with the exception of one session where there was a succession of part scores, there has been a lot to keep us interested|pg||
nt|vugraphzgj: I'm wearing out my alert button :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hmm or 3@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: South really doesn't want to play @H unless Opener has 4 -- so I prefer checkback if it is available|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h7|nt|ahh: practical shot from Ann|pg||
nt|ady: 11 tricks in hearts     spade lead will come   so no chance of a slam slipping through|pg||
nt|cliveo: Ann is consistent in her bidding style with long suits|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hope they dont get any rushes of blood to the head here|pg||
nt|cliveo: In the other matches, England are losing to Northern Ireland, whereas the England B team have a comfortable lead over Scotland|pg||
nt|xenya: S might be considering a @D conract -- well both 3N and 5@D make|pg||
nt|mariner1: BTU mixed is about to take the lead|pg||
nt|mariner1: 16 was a 9 imp swing and a new leader, still very close|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what do you think of north's 2@S bid?  i'm trying to decide if 3@H or 3@C had merits [i.e. why introduce bad 4 card suit when partner known not to hold 4@S - else negative DBL]|pg||
nt|mariner1: danger here is S is trying to talk himself out of something.........|pg||
nt|ahollan1: are either of these 'mixed' NS players female?|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|ahh: opps bidding warned her off getting too high |pg||
nt|phil_20686: Slam looks awfully far away if partner cannot find a bid over 2@s, so no real danger in just bidding game|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and i meant blast 4@S|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4 of either major works|pg||
nt|mariner1: do not know|pg||
pc|c8|nt|henryb: I must confess I would not overcall 4@h. I think North's hand is far too strong|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mariner1: has to avoid 2 @H losers|pg||
nt|xenya: N's name looks like a female one|pg||
nt|mariner1: a pair of I don't have this suit cue bids :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzgx: S: female N: Male|pg||
pc|c9|nt|jcomyn: I smell 4NT|pg||
nt|cliveo: England have had a very poor record in recent years at the Camrose and now we have the B team leading the A team!|pg||
nt|cliveo: Indeed as the scores stand at the moment, the England B team is hot on the heels of Ireland|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes but you wouldnt call the EBU weak now would you|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|xenya: oh |pg||
nt|ahollan1: thanks operator!|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|nt|cliveo: You say that John, but interestingly Bell and byrne, for example, were not considered strong enough to play in the U28 team at Beijing, but were selected for this event|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and has to avoid losing transportation before @S established|pg||
pc|h6|nt|xenya: walking on thin ice now? |pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm intrigued by this hand -- have absolutely no idea about potential nuances|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|cliveo: I am not criticising that selection, because Byrne in particular has a very impressive record with a wide variety of partners, but in our Premier League his team did not qualify ...|pg||
nt|cliveo: for the A division|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ahollan1: definitely best that East is on lead |pg||
pc|h9|pc|hT|nt|ahollan1: cashing @DA doesn't hurt at all - @S makes setting up that suit easy -- @C pitch @D|pg||
nt|mariner1: well they found a spot.....|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|mariner1: 17 produced 1 imp so now a 3 imp match|pg||
pc|h2|nt|phil_20686: right i will take this opportunity to get some ribena|pg||
nt|jcomyn: so there yar and they beat England in the first round|pg||
nt|mariner1: so in control now|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|sga1: absolutely. Basically a 4 loser hand only with rough LTC.|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d7|pg||
nt|cliveo: It does show how difficult a selector's job is, and I have great sympathy with them because I was once chairman of a rugby selection committee for five years, and received the odd ...|pg||
nt|cliveo: criticism myself|pg||
nt|ahollan1: among other things -- did RDBL suggest a @H stopper or just stronger hand|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|henryb: but then at my table the auction would start P-1@h-1@s-2@h|pg||
nt|xenya: i would assume the latter|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|nt|ahollan1: me too - so south never did show a stopper -- a puzzlement|pg||
pc|sK|pg||

nt|ciaran: looks like 1N going -1 on board 7 |pg||
nt|jcomyn: nothing to this|pg||
nt|ciaran: at the other table|pg||
nt|vugraphzgj: still no connection - working in office |pg||
nt|sharynr: will make 4@h here, unless takes a @h finesse into North!. otherwise, a strip and endplay coming.|pg||
nt|sharynr: butopps can foil that by cashing spades |pg||
nt|ciaran: May go wrong if N opens 2S|pg||
nt|jcomyn: Hughe is not as green as he is cabbage-looking I assure you|pg||
nt|cliveo: We were discussing this during another match yesterday, and the conclusion was that the consistency of the Irish selection has a lot to do with its success|pg||
nt|jcomyn: ah part score at last|pg||
nt|vugraphzgj: East aplologising for not bidding six!|pg||
nt|henryb: as well he should|pg||
nt|ahollan1: result says +420, but I still prefer 4@S|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S here also|pg||
nt|xenya: this might be  costly|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ady: an easy 6NT|pg||
nt|phil_20686: I am a very old 22 year old, i like sherry and scotch in small doses|pg||
mb|p|nt|sga1: yes.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the very best NS can hope for is a push|pg||
mb|1S|nt|cliveo: a teetotal scottish junior? whatever next!|pg||
nt|ady: not much difficulty here|pg||
nt|phil_20686: i think 5N will come out of the box here|pg||
nt|cliveo: yes, it would be a major surprise if they don't play in 6NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: not selected Clive - they murdered the winners of our prelim trials in the final trial|pg||
nt|henryb: 6@h cold from N chair|pg||
mb|2N|nt|cliveo: If the Welsh pair outbid the Irish on this board in the open room, it is difficult to believe Garvey and Carroll will be outbid!|pg||
nt|cliveo: whatever the methods are, the same team has played for some time|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes five years now|pg||
nt|sga1: Now we see 5@c again with a good hand.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but lose 12 much more likely|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: can NS make 4@S here?|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, but somehoww not too likely|pg||
nt|xenya: the push i meant|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ady: I dont think west should be encouraging a grand slam with that shape    likely to be at least a vital queen or king missing|pg||
nt|cliveo: I know top players don't like to use blackwood, but anyone who reached a grand on this hand needs to revisit their bidding system|pg||
nt|ady: they wont play lower than 6NT  thats for sure|pg||
nt|cliveo: your B team seemed to perform creditably in the last two Camroses, so it isn't as if you have no other good players|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil_20686: I think it depends largely on partners shape, if he has a 5 card suit grand rates to be fairly good I think, at any rate, with a poor min east is not accepting|pg||
nt|sga1: What these guys r bidding?|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S is not likely either|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: true we have some verfy good players down the line, |pg||
nt|cliveo: Goodness me! Garvey-Carroll outbid on a part score!|pg||
mb|p|nt|cliveo: I have to say, it seems odd to me when you have such a strong team, that you have trials|pg||
nt|henryb: They play in a different world from that you and I inhabit|pg||
nt|mariner1: I agree on last hand Al, 4@S much safer spot..... NMF or checkback would have|pg||
nt|mariner1: worked|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N - showing the @D stopper :)|pg||
pc|cK|nt|jcomyn: not really clive Hanlon and McGann outbid|pg||
nt|vugraphzgx: Sorry for the connection problem.|pg||
nt|sybarra: nothing you can do :(|pg||
pc|c3|nt|phil_20686: Bakshi agrees with Edwin - that is good enough for me :)|pg||
nt|ahh: its more basic than that Phil if he doesnt have all the bullets  grand is poor |pg||
nt|sharynr: if he knows all the cards like we do, he can do the strip and endplay because of the doubleton diamond K|pg||
nt|ciaran: i guess if the previous hand - KT9xxx xxxx xx x or so was a 2S, this is a 1S :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: anyway Tom is playing it and he is even less green if a little more cabbage-looking - no he is not Annie don't worry|pg||
nt|mariner1: on 19 S opened 3@D and it went SWISH in open :)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|phil_20686: yes, but he didnt try to investigate with a combined 35-37 count|pg||
nt|ahh: if he has all the bullets theres a hole somewhere else |pg||
nt|vugraphzgj: play did not take long !|pg||
nt|cliveo: an interesting sequence. Let's say Forrester held something like A@s A@h Axxxx@d and AK@c, then 7NT would be a spread|pg||
nt|jcomyn: just joking|pg||
nt|jcomyn: he didnt go down did he?|pg||
nt|ciaran: Maybe bidding 4H is a bit pushy when partner could not act over 1S? |pg||
nt|sharynr: apparently he did|pg||
nt|vugraphzgj: official score sheet reads -1|pg||
nt|ciaran: Seems normal to go one off misguessing hearts|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 9-what Ciaran|pg||
nt|ciaran: :) maybe Tom hasn't read that book|pg||
nt|jcomyn: there we go teaching beginners and Tom ignores us|pg||
nt|cliveo: I think other players should have to demonstrate they have the ability to outperform the current team at this level|pg||
nt|cliveo: Though I know a lot of people disagree with me on selection methods|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well the players at home want trials and after all it means a 96-board practice before the camrose|pg||
nt|sga1: i believe so looking at their bidding.|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nasuki gets lucky to find @S tolerance!|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c7|pc|c8|nt|santyclz: Just check for waiters with red ties.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i hate to sound that critical - especially since we don't even know if NS have a checkback mechanism, but it is good point for discussion|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|hA|nt|woozle: 2H herebeatable, but not on a diamond lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: did he make 4 @H on last hand?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgx: yes|pg||
nt|woozle: good antennae|pg||
nt|vugraphzgx: she cashed the HA|pg||
nt|sybarra: well done to S and "my" agressive N |pg||
nt|santyclz: Thanks!  We were on tenterhooks.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|cliveo: Yes, but at most sports you select your strongest team. But don't worry, that's my last word on the subject!|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h4|pg||

nt|ahollan1: never mind -- transportation issue only if West had ducked that @D|pg||
mb|p|nt|cliveo: Another potential slam hand!|pg||
nt|sga1: 4@s for NS.|pg||

nt|jcomyn: anyone for 1S on S hand - not me|pg||
nt|cliveo: routine for this pair, surely?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes lol|pg||
nt|cliveo: without the intervention Garvey-Carroll have methods to distinguish between voids and singletons; I don't know if the double changes that, but probably not|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: dangerous interference now|pg||
nt|cliveo: 3NT would have shown a void without the double, probably still does|pg||
nt|ahollan1: over 2/1 game force, should 3@H show solid suit and/or extra high cards?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|phil_20686: grand only needs to be 57% to be a winning proposition, if you are sure your opposition will be in at least small slam, as here|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil_20686: the magic of imps :)|pg||
nt|cliveo: assuming they are playing 20-22 you could throw in j@d and a Q and still have all the other cards I mentioned|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes it does|pg||
nt|cliveo: I think Garvey will be very interested in moving forward now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i believe moscito uses 1@C as 15+ in 1st/2nd seat but 16+ in 3rd/4th -- but i won't swear to that|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS staying out properly here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the point is -- 1@S is limited by failure to open 1@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i know my vote - what say Vlad and Rob?|pg||
nt|mariner1: this|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: the Save?|pg||

nt|ahollan1: i agree - shows self sufficient suit|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, i agree Al|pg||
nt|ahollan1: too right Vlad -- force declarer to pitch winner and the she has to ruff next trick|pg||
nt|mariner1: 19 was a double set swing and 5 more imps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: presumably 4@D is cue-bid, just coincidence that he has length -- and south knows off at least @SA|pg||

nt|ahollan1: ugly hand to lead from|pg||
pc|h4|nt|jcomyn: 3 to the Q offside and bingo|pg||
nt|cliveo: A lot, yesterday!|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome back, S made the 4 @H's when we all dropped out |pg||
pc|h9|nt|mariner1: yes and @c makes the contract easy......|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|ahh: Phil will not know what a redouble card looks like  for the good of the junior captains blood pressure we take them out of the bidding box |pg||
nt|cliveo: Does everyone agree with Bakhshi's redouble?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: do you want to be in it though?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: I suppose all slams that make are good slams|pg||
nt|cliveo: As the late John Collings said, any slam that makes is a good one|pg||
nt|cliveo: Glad we agree :)|pg||
nt|henryb: be back in a moment. Coffee time|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now 4@H and a disciplined pass by north gets cheers from all|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well done!|pg||
nt|xenya: nicely done|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|woozle: South showing poor technique leading the top of a doubleton trump|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c8|pc|cA|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mariner1: well on 20 NS bid all the way to 2@S....... which will score imps but not enough|pg||
nt|xenya: a @D lead might have been awkward for declarer|pg||
nt|mariner1: that in Open|pg||
nt|ahollan1: natsuki - claim early, claim often [before anything goes wrong :) ]|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mariner1: I am assuming they make 2@S though|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ahh: yes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with doubleton trump, i would have tried @D instead of @C -- but leading from Jack is usually bad too|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|c2|nt|woozle: making six now, with two diamonds pitched on clubs|pg||
nt|sybarra: can not make 6 |pg||
nt|sybarra: *now|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c9|nt|cliveo: This sort of hand is why bridge is not a good spectator sport|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|cliveo: Obviously Phil can't answer this question :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @SK to preserve entry to dummy -- another fine play|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dQ|nt|phil_20686: depends on their agreements i would probably just have bid 1@s|pg||
nt|cliveo: We can all see that the contract is very easy to make whereas Garvey does not know the layout of the cards|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ahollan1: either odd-even or upside-down attitude -- but @H3 sure looks like "i like @H"|pg||
pc|d3|pc|sT|nt|jcomyn: he does now|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|s6|nt|cliveo: Perhaps Roland should work towards having edited highlights, match of the day style!|pg||
pc|h6|nt|cliveo: how should they find the heart fit then?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: a matchpoint animal would have hooked diamond|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
mc|10|nt|ady: re-double seems normal  especially with singleton@D|pg||
pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|roswolf: this looks exciting but will no doubt be flat|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|panja: if W's @DA were @HA..surely a slam prospect exists..so E has got try once|pg||
nt|vugraphzhp: three Chinese players are talking in their own language, so E says he feels lonely...|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h2|nt|athene: good lead|pg||

pc|c9|pc|cQ|pc|cK|pc|c2|pg||
mc|9|nt|panja: certainly not routine as I thought, but why is @H a good lead a priori?|pg||
nt|vugraphzhp: "good lead" by N.|pg||
nt|athene: well i mean it's a good lead on the hand :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: South did not find the heart lead in the other room|pg||
nt|athene: but to be fair south just didn't have a safe lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4th highest longest and strongest!?|pg||
nt|athene: well, i am sure if south had held the same hand without the @CK, she would have led a club|pg||
nt|swanson: Evan Bailey, a California expert who sadly passed away recently, did a computer simulation on leads and found that the least attractive were Q9x(x) and K10x(x).|pg||
nt|roswolf: the momentum increases|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5th best works too, Geoffrey :)|pg||
nt|athene: anythign except first best :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|swanson: So South had good reason to lead a heart in Evan's study.|pg||
pg||

nt|jcomyn: but much of the entertainment is watching the score hand after hand|pg||
nt|santyclz: The @h guess wasn't too tough.|pg||
nt|sybarra: and 12 imps to n/s on bd 20 |pg||
nt|woozle: Now, 4S maybe making overtricks...a useless board for the trailing team|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good claim :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahh: Bakshi hand from last board has rotated 90 degrees |pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: this is like a rugby match that has a stream of scrums in the middle of the field with nothing happening|pg||
nt|cliveo: this looks like a routine 4@h contract but with the fun and games we've had at this table, who knows|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i wonder if Zia would have played @S10 at trick 1|pg||
nt|mariner1: this is the penultimate board of the match........... score still very close|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|cliveo: Although as we can see, 4@s is a good save|pg||
nt|jcomyn: lets all bid each others suits|pg||
nt|cliveo: Carroll has opened another hand that most people would pass|pg||
nt|cliveo: And presumably Garvey has made some sort of game force in @h|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes but saving can be very dangerous when opps dont agree|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3@D would be my call......|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that sure would have slowed down the play|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil_20686: your hearts don't look good with the hearts on your right, i would rather have AJxx or similar, a true finesse, conversly, your spades have improved, and your hand isnt really good ...|pg||
nt|phil_20686: enough to penalise at the one level - you don;t want to discourage the opposition from competing to 3@H - I would know what to do to that|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't understand East's DBL either|pg||
nt|mariner1: W certainly should think it shows something in a major|pg||
nt|mariner1: this is the penultimate board of this session........ next session in 30 minutes|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ahh: all the girls love Tony |pg||
nt|cliveo: A distinguished kibitzer has pointed out that 4@s is not good on a @s lead|pg||
nt|cliveo: Do we know what 3@d means?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgj: no|pg||
nt|mariner1: be sure to check the vugraph schedule, lot of good one there -|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://online.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php - BBO Vugraph Schedule (set|pg||
nt|mariner1: up to show times for your area)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what system/convention has East bid 2@D?|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S!|nt|ahh: he always has lots of @D|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H  likely spot    will fail to bad trump split|pg||
nt|ady: re-doubled showing 3 hearts|pg||
nt|ahh: xx = 3 @H ?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: usuall extras whoich he dont have|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sick == this will actually work|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seeing dummy makes @H shift easy|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahh: too quick for me David |pg||
nt|xenya: EW can make 5@C here |pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@D must show @c and @S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: top & bottom?|pg||
nt|xenya: but unlikely to bid it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: top & another??|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|jcomyn: I think this may well be bid nowe that Tommy thinks hand is better than it is|pg||
nt|cliveo: I see obviously not a minimum 1@h opener!|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and TG will think his CK is well placed|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: yes when I saw the DBL did not occur to me it was penalty :)|pg||
mb|4D!|nt|jcomyn: oh well thats it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice @CA - now @D finesse|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: still a 6-imp swing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i haven't seen either of those treatments in a long time|pg||
mb|4S|nt|cliveo: No, he is well attuned to the Carroll opening style|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or not :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: dont like the spade bid with 3 small  and 4 clubs to the ace|pg||
nt|ady: unusual with my typing|pg||
nt|jcomyn: you have obviously been watching this pair closely|pg||
nt|cliveo: You've been giving me a good inside line on their style!|pg||
nt|mariner1: we have a close match again...... 4 imps|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahh: i like this  10 bds in   5 flat boards    best scottish performance for ages |pg||
nt|phil_20686: i don't think norths double here is all that clear, perhaps they are nervoud about getting bullied out of the auction as happened to their team mates against the irish.|pg||
nt|cliveo: reverting to our theme on board 10, it is unlikely Bakhshi will expect N to hold 4@h|pg||
nt|ahh: i think its a clear double by passed hand |pg||
nt|cliveo: I don't disagree|pg||
nt|phil_20686: (and may encourage partner to sac whn its wrong) - would like to see north have more shape and not not Txxx as one of her two suits|pg||
nt|ahh: no sacrificing at  green all   by 2 passed hands |pg||
nt|cliveo: the point is, that with competitive bidding being much more aggressive these days, you don't have to assume that just because someone doubles the suits break badly with the length ...|pg||
nt|cliveo: inthe opposite hand|pg||
nt|phil_20686: you don't sac over game only jim, could easil sac in 2s-1 against 2h-1 with the north hand|pg||
nt|ahh: in Aberden if someone makes a take out double it just about guareentees length in the suit opened|pg||
nt|phil_20686: i think he will now, no one is leading a doubleton diamond on this auction surely|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but this 2 imps to BTU-cheng|pg||
mb|p|pc|dQ|nt|cliveo: Let's hope the scrums end shortly and we move back to some open play!|pg||
pc|dA|nt|henryb: this has few chances, but remembering the 3@c contract ...|pg||
nt|sga1: Actually it will make.|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4 boards to be score however none look like big swings|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ahollan1: good @S exit|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ahollan1: closed room coming to the misplayed vul 5@D hand now|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ahollan1: @S10 may/should have suit preference overtones - confirming @H|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sga1: Now home.|pg||
nt|sga1: Sry No.|pg||
nt|henryb: really? loks like 2@s, 1@h, 1@d and one @c to lose|pg||
nt|sga1: He has to finesse @h now.|pg||
nt|henryb: and only eight winners|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|phil_20686: this does not look to be a great switch|pg||
nt|ahh: not the best time for a trump switch sadly |pg||
nt|ady: play ace and another    still no chance|pg||
nt|ady: trump switch ok   |pg||
nt|ahh: even ducking is ok |pg||
nt|ady: yes|pg||
nt|ahh: then can overruff   and play 2 more |pg||
nt|cliveo: although it might not cost giving the contract to Forrester, it seems a really strange switch when partner is known to hold hearts, and if there is a tenace position you are ...|pg||
nt|cliveo: risking giving a trick away|pg||
nt|phil_20686: still a diamond, or a spade return, would lead rather less riskily to -1|pg||
nt|phil_20686: swap the K and A of hearts, and you have just let through the contract by letting him ditch his spade honours on the top clubs|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: 2nd chance to take @D finesse rejected -- i guess declarer ok with @H suit being frozen|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s2|pg||
nt|phil_20686: spade losers that is|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes I said earlier they were only in 2@S there|pg||
pc|s5|pc|c5|pc|sQ|pc|s9|pg||
nt|ahollan1: trading @S trick for @H trick|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|pc|cQ|nt|mariner1: right still -100|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that was painful to watch -- auction and play |pg||
nt|mariner1: and now the last board of this session.............|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|d8|nt|jcomyn: good job they werent in it|pg||

mb|1S|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|roswolf: this should be fun|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why don't they give us a dull hand so that I can tell about the 28 IMP swing|pg||
nt|panja: can EW make 5@D here?|pg||
mb|2H|mb|2S|mb|4D|nt|athene: that north hand is a problem for people who claim you need a 6-card suit for 2@C over 1@S at this vul|pg||
mb|4S|nt|swanson: An improbably low spade lead will set 4@S.|pg||
nt|athene: of course you would LIKE to have a 6-card suit|pg||
nt|athene: but you don't always get dealt one|pg||
nt|roswolf: splinter raise as well - fairly agrressive imo|pg||
nt|athene: the Poles solve the problem with the raptor 1NT overcall (4major 5minor)|pg||
mb|5C|nt|swanson: I think full values for the splinter.|pg||
nt|athene: that's the hand you most often have which doesn't have any convenient call |pg||
nt|panja: if there is no slam prospect, 4@D isn't a great choice....but in some situations it might help in competition|pg||
mb|5S|mb|6H|mb|p|nt|athene: 4@D has to be better than 4@H, especially as it doesn't give the opps any more useful room|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: optimism exraordinary|pg||
mb|6S|nt|athene: north envisages both long suits running|pg||
nt|athene: and she has the controls|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not that silly. It make E-W bid one more|pg||
nt|roswolf: guessing game|pg||
mb|d|nt|Walddk2: and they did|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: well...E did not have to bid 4@S...E could have doubled 4@D to show length|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: east should perhaps have hit 6@H|pg||
nt|athene: since she knows the clubs aren't running|pg||
pc|d4|nt|Walddk2: Funny how often the opponents believe you when you bid a vulnerable slam, against NV|pg||
nt|panja: good lead....good to avoid the @CA lead|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d8|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|swanson: Chen might not have flown solo on the auction - he could have tried to describe his hand earlier in the auction.|pg||

pc|d7|pc|dA|nt|roswolf: yes |pg||

pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|s5|pc|s3|pg||
nt|athene: one thing i have noticed is that in competition|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sT|pc|s7|nt|roswolf: big swing likely then|pg||
mc|9|nt|athene: if opps ever splinter, it really doesn't pay to sacrifice in any suit other than the splinter suit|pg||

nt|ahollan1: any guesses about 2N?|pg||
nt|mariner1: we have a 3 imp match with 3 boards to score|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ahh: are you confident with your favourite partner  you both play it the same way ?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: not the ideal time for funnies|pg||
nt|cliveo: that swing seemed to come from nowhere. it shows how much harder it is to play a hand single dummy|pg||

nt|phil_20686: xx after i have rebid my suit at the 4 level, yes, im confident they will not run :)|pg||

nt|ahollan1: well - there goes the @H trick|pg||
nt|mariner1: @c lead helps a little here|pg||

mb|1C|an|strong|nt|swanson: These are great hands for a team which was down 40 just a few deals ago.|pg||
nt|athene: we are seeing a lot of voids today|pg||
mb|1S|an|majors or minors|nt|athene: will the 1@S call tell declarer how to play the diamonds?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's often a problem to open a strong club with a hand like Sun's|pg||
mb|2C|nt|panja: cryptic overcall, allowed on Prec 1@C..but barred on std 1@C opening|pg||
mb|2S|an|pass or correct|nt|Walddk2: Before you know it, you have to bid your first suit uncomfortably high|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|athene: the E-W bidding is telling a lot about the distribution, if North knows what inferences to draw|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Here all is well, but what if the tray comes back to you with 4@C pass pass?|pg||
nt|athene: for the pass/correct 2@S bid, west has to be prepared to play at the 3-level if his partner has minors|pg||
mb|3N|nt|roswolf: now a punt!?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Then you bid 4@D, but you haven't shown a 5-card major yet|pg||
mb|p|nt|swanson: The interference should help declarer judge the play in whatever game they reach.|pg||
nt|athene: now 5@H perhaps|pg||
nt|athene: maybe just a quiet 4@H|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@H could well be passed|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 14 IMPs to China on 44. We have match now|pg||
nt|athene: i guess north can assume east has majors rather than minors|pg||
nt|athene: in which case, as a spec points out, she might not bother to bid hearts at all|pg||
nt|athene: and just put all her money on diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: so 4@D now looks best|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Interesting point made by Peter Crouch. Should 4@D over 2@S be leaping Michaels?|pg||
nt|athene: that's a nice use for leaping michaels :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: 6@D is practical too|pg||
nt|swanson: The interference should make North wary of being agressive - four hearts (or more) are behind her.|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|roswolf: the match is close now|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|athene: perhaps she simply isn't sure whether east has majors or minors, still|pg||
nt|roswolf: can south move?|pg||
nt|swanson: South should probably bid 5@D.|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s2|nt|athene: now north can foresee problems with overruffs since east has the heart length|pg||
nt|roswolf: missed chance - science hampered n/s here|pg||
nt|swanson: Declarer must finesse diamonds on the first round, then play three rounds of hearts.|pg||
nt|athene: slam is going to need partner having some useful red honours|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What missed chance?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You can't make slam|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|pc|s4|pg||

nt|cliveo: competition as seriously as the Republic of Ireland?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ciaran: interesting hand - 4S is an ok spot but no good on this layout|pg||
nt|cliveo: As you can see, the Irish pair made 3NT in the other room|pg||
mb|4D|nt|jcomyn: daresay he has to bid it|pg||
nt|cliveo: And yet Garvey could have let them play in 2@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharynr: and 4@d will make as well|pg||
nt|jcomyn: lucky|pg||
mb|4S|nt|vugraphzgj: I'm not sure if the 2 tables are connected but don't want to shut down as last time I tried that we lost the connection|pg||
nt|henryb: to 4 no less|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahh: no i think so far as Scotland is concerned  we have a very small pool of talent |pg||
nt|jcomyn: and copper time|pg||
nt|cliveo: for the second time in this set, EW with 24 points have virtually been shut out from the auction|pg||
nt|henryb: well done|pg||
mb|5C|nt|jcomyn: chopper|pg||
mb|p|nt|ciaran: the lack of entries to south means that the clubs can't be picked up.  (assuming no early ruff for E)|pg||
nt|cliveo: Some welcome points back for the Irish team|pg||
mb|5D|nt|jcomyn: well I wouldnt pass 2D with the W hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|cliveo: but therefore you would expect much more consistency in the selection process|pg||
mb|6D|nt|jcomyn: Club switch demanded|pg||
nt|sharynr: having doubled 3@S i dont see why he has to bid at all, when his partner did not cooperate|pg||
nt|ciaran: Hugh looking for an early ruff  - leading suit preference 2|pg||
mb|p|nt|cliveo: What it does demonstrate is that if a pair plays a very aggressive style against you, your methods are put to the test|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahh: and we hold pair trials  which encourages different pairings  getting in the team |pg||
nt|ady: england in 4@H  not doubled board 12|pg||
nt|cliveo: yes, I know some people violently disagree with me, but I think this process is seriously flawed|pg||
nt|henryb: I think 4@s could be beaten if N ducks the first @s|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: Tom u mean or is it|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ciaran: yes - Tom!|pg||
nt|cliveo: I am sure that Rees-Kurbalija will look at some of these hands and work out that they need to revisit their actions against very aggressive opponents|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but Filip bid a vul, 2D he has hardly done that on a 9-count|pg||
nt|cliveo: How do you think the auction should have proceeded then, John?|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c5|nt|ahh: our obvious strongest teams  have been tried with  poor results |pg||

nt|sharynr: he will still need to take the @h finesse as the clubs are blocked|pg||
nt|vugraphzgj: director called revoke|pg||
nt|sharynr: and the heart finesse must come first|pg||
nt|ciaran: yes - can just get to dummy once|pg||
nt|jcomyn: what revoke?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgj: McGann revoked|pg||
nt|sharynr: who revoked? maybe this will make after all :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzgj: on @S|pg||
nt|jcomyn: how could he he had only one|pg||
nt|sharynr: maybe he played it on the second round|pg||
nt|ciaran: Very low scoring segment so far - particularly compared to last night and this morning's first 16 boards|pg||
nt|jcomyn: no on the 4th round|pg||
nt|jcomyn: on the SAce|pg||
nt|sharynr: sorry folks, have to leave you now. enjoy the rest of the match |pg||

nt|panja: and South is not granting that wish here..|pg||

pc|c7|pc|cK|pc|c2|pc|cT|pg||
nt|panja: the crux of the issue is the switch here|pg||
nt|athene: of course you would rather be in spades but this should play fine|pg||
nt|swanson: It is useful that the @SQ9 is onside doubleton.|pg||
nt|panja: will this make for sure?|pg||
nt|athene: you have to decide whether you are going to play to elope with ruffs, or try to get the spades going|pg||

nt|Walddk7: Choose your game here. 3NT, 4@S, 5@D|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this is the biggest defecit I have seen by Ireland in 5 years|pg||
nt|cliveo: This is the last board of the session. Thanks very much to my co-commentator John Comyn, and to Sandie Millichip, our ever-efficient operator. (Hope I've spelt the names ...|pg||
nt|cliveo: correctly!)|pg||
nt|vugraphzgj: it's only 1/2 time|pg||

nt|jcomyn: very interesting morning Clive|pg||
nt|golfsquash: yes, 56-21|pg||
nt|vugraphzgj: it's been spelt worse.  use your imagination!|pg||
nt|cliveo: agreed John, it has been magnificent entertainment, and I have enjoyed your witty and incisive comments|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: I am not friendly, and I was the one who told you|pg||
nt|ahh: of course its Sandie not Sandy |pg||
nt|ahh: welcome to Grumpy |pg||
nt|ahh: hi Roland |pg||
nt|ady: 4@H a good spot|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahh: and thanks |pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|nt|ady: forester wont be interested with his poor  heart suit and AK clubs|pg||
nt|jcomyn: oh no|pg||
nt|jcomyn: or maybe not|pg||
nt|henryb: looks like making two without breaking a sweat.|pg||
pc|c8|nt|phil_20686: Sandie is teasing us|pg||
nt|jcomyn: clubs 3-3 might help|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but not a lot|pg||
nt|ciaran: Thanks all|pg||
nt|jcomyn: mind both finesses wrong is unlucky|pg||
nt|ciaran: No - does not seem to be a 12th trick available.|pg||
nt|jcomyn: unless some misdefence of some description although cant see it|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|ahh: or not :)|pg||
nt|cliveo: A flat board to finish - have a good lunch everyone!|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h9|nt|henryb: Anyway, I hope all 38 of you enjoyed yourselves. Thanks to the Welsh Bridge Union for arranging this, to the players for subjecting themselves to scrutiny|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ahh: still cuing away |pg||
nt|henryb: To Simon Richards for a tough job well done, and to BBO for making it all possible|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|nt|ady: I am surpriesed     this is a poor contract|pg||
nt|cliveo: If Forrester takes all the right views, he could make|pg||
nt|vugraphzgj: very late alert|pg||
nt|ahh: no law against bidding poor contracts |pg||
nt|phil_20686: well well, more imps to scotland i expect, i feel west has a sign off over his splinter with AK opposite shortage -  he has bid his hand at that point I feel|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ahh: no law against them making either |pg||
nt|ahh: i am sure ARF will listen and learn Phil |pg||
nt|cliveo: if he makes it, we will probably see an article in the Daily Telegraph. With an anonymous declarer, of course!|pg||
nt|ahh: :)|pg||
nt|ahh: ARF = Antony   R  Forrester |pg||
nt|cliveo: When I lived in Wakefield as a young man, I was very fortunate that the Forrester family often fed and watered me. I saw Tony's mum Jean recently. Indeed, my wife and I played with ...|pg||
nt|cliveo: ehr in a teams competition. Though she is in her early 80s, she still plays a mean game, and indeed we almost won the competition|pg||
nt|ady: he may try to ruff club suit good     this line may fail    can make bringing the spades in  and doing the right thing with hearts|pg||
nt|ahh: this board will take some time |pg||
nt|cliveo: yes, he needs to get the @h suit right. If he does this, his success depends on whether he plays the @h suit or the @c suit|pg||
nt|cliveo: sorry, @s suit or @c suit|pg||
nt|ahh: has to decide what he wants to pitch on @D as well |pg||
nt|phil_20686: well we have heard of Tony's Declarer play, but if he makes this one i will be impressed, surely 3-3 clubs and this heart layout is the best chance?|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s4|pc|sJ|pc|sK|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c9|pc|d3|nt|ahh: going to take @S finesse ?|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h4|pc|hT|pc|hK|pg||
pc|h7|pc|s7|nt|phil_20686: he is figing himself the extra chance of Kx@s onside i beleive|pg||
nt|cliveo: isn't playing on @s suit a better percentage?|pg||
nt|phil_20686: giving*|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
pc|h6|nt|henryb: North can get squeezed for an extra overtrick now|pg||
nt|henryb: pitch a @c, @hAK and the @dK|pg||
