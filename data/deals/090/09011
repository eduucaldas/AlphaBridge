mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jtr: Townsend-Gold will play for england in the Bermuda Bowl later this year|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The format is barometer. This means that gthe same boards are being played all over the room simultaneously|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Which is quite good for us, since we are likely to get the rankings pretty quickly|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h2|nt|Walddk2: Looks like 420, losing 2 spades and 1 heart|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hK|pg||

nt|jtr: Hi Tommy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good news for all Meckwell fans|pg||
nt|jtr: Rather interesting fact, Tom Townsend was taught to play Bridge by David's father who taught at his school|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We will feature them in 10 of the 13 rounds this morning|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hope most of you like that|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Meckwell are the reigning champions from 2 years ago in Menton, France|pg||
nt|tsanders: Lucky to get by with that opening lead - strange declarer didn't try for 5|pg||
nt|Vugraph99: Ok we skip board 2 because they played it while i was taking a coffee with Lavazza's Girls...|pg||
nt|Vugraph99: Round 2 now :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nothing new Herve|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Anything else would have surprised us|pg||
nt|jtr: He probably thought it was a shortage lead and didnt want trump promotions|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So our first look at Meckstroth and Rodwell|pg||
nt|Vugraph99: and if everything is ok ...Meckstroth-Rodwell vs Muller-De Wijs will be next match ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Muller - de Wijs were on the Dutch team that won the open teams the other day|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Comprehensively even when their Polish opponents conceded after 32 of 48 boards|pg||
nt|tsanders: a preview of Portugal, maybe|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Meckwell: Precision|pg||
nt|tsanders: It appears from here that the "big Orange team" is rolling|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Muller - de Wijs: Also strong club|pg||

nt|Walddk2: That's matchpoints for you|pg||
nt|Vugraph99: on  this board Meckwell scored 90% ( thanks to Bridgemate ! )|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Meckwell will stay at this table through board 14|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Didn't that surprise you guys?|pg||

nt|tsanders: what was the % on board 3?|pg||
nt|jtr: wow that seems a lot Was everyone getting higher?|pg||
nt|Vugraph99: cant see it...:(|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Our operator in Room Tenerife is Herve Lustman from France. Unfortunately for us, the Lavazza girls are only 27 yeards away from him|pg||
nt|Walddk2: yards  even |pg||
nt|Walddk2: So if Herve misses the play and rankings you will know why|pg||
nt|tsanders: maybe many bid with the with hand over 1@s - doesn't really have a sensible bid.|pg||
nt|tsanders: south hand|pg||
nt|Vugraph99: :)|pg||
nt|jtr: Now we have the Polish losing finalists from the teams|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I believe Jankauskas is from Lithuania|pg||
nt|jtr: ah sorry|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Someone will correct me if I'm wrong|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I was right|pg||
