mb|p|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|ralfwil: For me Wests hand is perfect for a rise on an invitation with the aces.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|mamos: Not many Wests would pass after 1@H|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ralfwil: interesting second bid on S. If they are playing a 5-card major opening 2@h shows a 6-card suit or?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 2C would not be universal |pg||
nt|eggy: just one of the "never" (type 3) camp I guess|pg||

nt|ralfwil: that´s my opinion too|pg||
nt|eggy: just standard I think|pg||

mb|2S!|mb|d|nt|mamos: 5@S now?|pg||
nt|mamos: 4NT B/wood?|pg||
mb|5S|nt|odysseus69: or 3S or pass or 6s or 5S or...|pg||
nt|odysseus69: that wont stop east|pg||
mb|6H|nt|eggy: I think I prefer that to the open room decision|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: no stopping East anyway|pg||
nt|odysseus69: i prefer 3S|pg||
nt|eggy: They will need to save 7 I suppose - |pg||
nt|eggy: but after the think, unlikely to save against 6 if West passes|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: over 6s-pass - west should bid grand|pg||
nt|ralfwil: The disadvantage with 5@s is that E can draw the right conclusion |pg||
nt|oliverc: quite|pg||
nt|mamos: and West for that matter |pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree Victor!|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|nt|eggy: I think that N should still bid and see what they do|pg||
mb|p|mb|7H|mb|p|nt|oliverc: East pass here showing the void?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: now they must save in 7@s|pg||
nt|odysseus69: has to bid 7S now |pg||
nt|odysseus69: North not South|pg||
nt|eggy: He knows he must save 7 too, but Westmay think N must have a trick to bi 6S|pg||
nt|odysseus69: North has adopted the worst approach possible|pg||
mb|p|nt|eggy: But North puts the problem back to S :)|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sJ|pc|sT|pc|h2|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Here we have a combination of doubles P shows NO  or two defensive trick and S can now see that @cK probably is on side for declarer and must save|pg||

pc|h3|pc|s7|pc|hK|pc|s3|pg||

pc|d7|pg||
pc|d4|nt|dburn: would the East-West bidding have been different if North rather than West held the queen of clubs?|pg||
pc|c2|pc|dA|nt|oliverc: I must confess I would be tempted to PASS over West's Double here. Bidding some|pg||
nt|oliverc: huge number of Spades immediately on such a weak hand can just make life easy|pg||
nt|oliverc: for Opps. Left to themselves, it's unlikely E/W will bid 7@H here.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If @cK was on N he had to double, showing a supposed trick |pg||
nt|vugraphzjj: cards played wrong - N kept diamonds|pg||
nt|odysseus69: yes - I still like 3S although I have been experimenting with xx|pg||
nt|dburn: put it this way - if I could allow my opponents to play a grand slam on a finesse on every board of a match, I would expect to win that match by a large margin|pg||
mc|13|nt|eggy: So what do you do if they do bid 6/7 spades after you pass?|pg||

nt|dburn: and you lot are simply resulting - what North-South did on this board was fine, and so was what East-West did|pg||

mb|4C|nt|eggy: one of the mysteries of life Ralf|pg||
nt|odysseus69: South is shell-shocked from previous board|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dA|nt|eggy: and only 4C now seems a bit wet too!|pg||
