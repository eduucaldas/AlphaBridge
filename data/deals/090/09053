mb|1C|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: competition here - who wins?|pg||
nt|cliveo: The Irish team have already built up a large lead; they are on 56 VPs after three matches, 9 VPs ahead of three teams in equal second, England A, England B and Northern Ireland. ...|pg||
nt|cliveo: Wales are not far behind on 43. So if Wales win they are back in the hunt. It's an important morning for them|pg||
nt|henryb: one of those hands that many nowadays open with 1N|pg||
nt|woozle: transfer openings?|pg||
mb|1H|nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||

nt|mariner1: Hi All and Welcome to the NTU Cup 2009 from Taipei. This is the 1st session of|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Vlad - do you see any Moscito players in Russia?|pg||
mb|2C|nt|sharynr: hello "crowd"|pg||

mb|3C|nt|jcomyn: dont think so|pg||

nt|cliveo: The Irish have almost become unbeatable in this competition and it will be a tough task for Rees and Kurbalija, particularly as they had a very hard set against Bakhshi and ...|pg||
nt|cliveo: Forrester last evening|pg||
nt|woozle: 4S NS is playable, and there are 5/6 honours onside making it cold|pg||
nt|xenya: i don't think so|pg||
nt|mariner1: no games here,,,,,,,|pg||
mb|4S|nt|vugraphzgj: sorry - sleeping|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 5-5 in clubs who cares any more?|pg||
nt|cliveo: As you can see, the Irish have an aggressive opening style|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and 4-4 in D by opps|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 5-4|pg||
mb|5C|nt|cliveo: Which makes it difficult for them to find their 5-5 club fit|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and us ordinary mortals go 1S-1Nt-2C and bops your uncle|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: a conservative pass by N|pg||
nt|mariner1: hi Al :)|pg||
nt|woozle: of course, NS didn't even think about such a foolish game|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: Not so conservative when partner's range is 14-16|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we're at it again, aye Rob|pg||
nt|mariner1: not a lot of action expected on this board.|pg||
nt|woozle: might make 5 if East doesn't return a diamond|pg||
nt|mariner1: take that back, 4@H has play|pg||
nt|mariner1: not that they will be in game ever here|pg||
nt|xenya: cold actually?|pg||
mb|d|nt|cliveo: exactly|pg||
nt|jcomyn: oh well what would we know|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i don't think i've Moscito from anyone other than Pan Asian players [including Australia & New Zealand]|pg||
pc|d3|nt|cliveo: Although in a 6-1 fit, and the suit breaking 4-2, Garvey can make this contract if he plays on hearts or clubs|pg||

pc|s6|pc|s9|nt|ahollan1: oops -- names being changed now|pg||
nt|xenya: both pairs playing Moscito here?|pg||

pc|s2|pg||
nt|mariner1: is Oz they are playing transfer and relay MOSCITO these days|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c4|pc|cA|nt|henryb: I wonder why people insist on winning the @dK. The @dQ is more deceptive actually|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @H9 in dummy increases chances for 3 tricks without double hook|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sQ|pc|cQ|pc|s4|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ahollan1: but -- west is the safe hand, so hook gains in that respect|pg||

nt|cliveo: Well done. So though Ireland were in an inferior contract to Wales it has only cost them 1 IMP|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think moscito would have opened East 1N -- so probably back to 2/1 pairs |pg||
nt|mariner1: Vlad we had MOSCITO pair here last session, do not know now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: transfer makes so much more sense to me|pg||
nt|xenya: i see|pg||
mb|1H|nt|phil_20686: Good morning Everyone|pg||
nt|cliveo: This time points evenly divided, looks like a heart spade battle|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hah - I beat Kieran to the follow-up|pg||
nt|woozle: anybody's partscore here -EW in clubs or maybe hearts; NS in diamonds or maybe spades|pg||

nt|henryb: 1@d P 1N 2@s?|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|cliveo: Good morning everyone|pg||
nt|henryb: no, weak NT and some sort of @c out|pg||
nt|woozle: is 3C weak?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on NZ pair in Beijing played 2-under transfers with other things looking Moscito like|pg||
nt|mariner1: in Oz,,,,,,, my typing is horrible these days|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S makes..... and even 6@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|Walddk4: Good morning David, Phil and Clive|pg||
nt|ady: good morning|pg||
nt|woozle: that might silence everybody|pg||
nt|mariner1: even 7@S|pg||
nt|mariner1: ruff out 2@D and claim|pg||
nt|ahollan1: I sure hope 2@H is transfer showing contructive @S raise or better|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: mm both thought of bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: hi all|pg||
nt|cliveo: However, Kurbalija stopped the spades being introduced|pg||
nt|woozle: or not...3D is an interesting effort|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: probably about down one|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i must say -- 1@D was flawless|pg||
nt|woozle: 3D might get some partscores right, but it carries big risks, like missing spade games|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but even if it does - this doesn't look like best way to start describing the hand|pg||
pc|h6|nt|jcomyn: ok|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Hi Sharyn and John|pg||
nt|sharynr: hey Roland and John :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hi Shariyn|pg||
nt|vugraphzgj: having a few connections problems.  Going to try taking computer back into room now it is connected!!|pg||
nt|sharynr: John, would you have bid over 2D?|pg||
nt|sharynr: with the south hand, that is /|pg||
nt|jcomyn: plenty of hcp but distribution not helpful|pg||
nt|sharynr: I agree|pg||
nt|jcomyn: depends on partner. Not sure|pg||
nt|jcomyn: keep attacking trumps|pg||
nt|sharynr: well the "math" seems to lean toward passing...since the most you can expect is a bad 9 from pard|pg||
nt|sharynr: I wonder if there is still a connection problem|pg||
nt|jcomyn: looks likely|pg||
nt|henryb: this should be 2 down|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes it does seem an unusual call|pg||
pc|h3|nt|phil_20686: Al together too early for bridge IMO, alarm felt awfully early this morning :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Forrester - Bakhshi  E-W  for England|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S  the limit|pg||
nt|cliveo: Both teams had a poor start yesterday, England losing 17-13 to their B team and Scotland 25-3 to the Republic of Ireland|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Adamson - Martin   N-S  for Scotland|pg||
nt|mariner1: can they find the nice slam here?|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|cliveo: Interestingly, both England and Scotland run trials to select their teams, and have not had a good result in the Camrose for some years with this method, whereas the Republic of ...|pg||
nt|cliveo: Ireland have picked the same team year in, year out, and have not been beaten for some years|pg||
nt|vugraphzgj: connection problems :(|pg||
nt|cliveo: You will find that every year, the composition of the English and Scottish teams is totally different from the previous year|pg||
nt|cliveo: Indeed, England won the silver medal at the Beijing Mind Games and yet only one pair from that team is playing this weekend|pg||
nt|jcomyn: club|pg||
nt|woozle: pass would have likely scored +50 - diamond lead, spade switch|pg||
nt|mariner1: so 2@H had to have been @S support|pg||
nt|ahollan1: without knowing all the NS agreements -- this sequence sounds like 3@D=game try|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm just assuming transfer responses over the Takeout DBL|pg||
nt|mariner1: I like the 2@H treatment here....|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i like it for game investigation, but looks cumbersome for slam invite|pg||
nt|ahollan1: North doesn't know if jump was because of @D honors - or shortness|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|cliveo: If Garvey wins and switches to a club this should go one off|pg||
nt|sga1: No looks -1|pg||
pc|hK|nt|cliveo: Adamson-Martin are one of the top lady Scottish pairs, and have done very well to win their place. The Scots, in fact, have three ladies in their team as Liz McGowan is playing ...|pg||
nt|cliveo: with David Liggatt|pg||
pc|h2|nt|phil_20686: It has always been my feeling that straight teams trials will seldom produce the best team|pg||
nt|ady: the hearts in the South hand are not strong enough to win twice  otherwise 4@S could go down|pg||
pc|h4|pc|c2|pg||
nt|sga1: sry u r right|pg||
nt|henryb: 3@c, 2@h and a @d|pg||
nt|sga1: Not any more|pg||
nt|woozle: now maybe club, club, third club for the trump demotion|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what is bug's option?   Neg DBL -- but no rebid after 3@H, PASS hoping for reopening double - then ?3@S?|pg||
nt|woozle: I'd pass, then 4S|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|jcomyn: and one off|pg||
nt|henryb: but now may make|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@H must be 1st or 2nd round control - and very discouraging for North - who now knows 4@S was based upon @D shortness rather than honors|pg||
nt|mariner1: does S see slam now?|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|Walddk4: what about a trump lead?|pg||
nt|xenya: i don't see how S could bid slam, aceless|pg||
nt|mariner1:  this board could be a big key in match,,,,, since 6 and 7 also make if bid|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|cliveo: I agree with Phil|pg||
nt|Walddk4: That would be very inconvenient for declarer|pg||
nt|ahollan1: welcome to no-man's land  2   [ 1=2N,  2=5Major,  3=3Major,  4=4minor]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Hsiangwen hears an auction that screams for a trump lead and does so -- then looks at the rest of his hand|pg||
pc|cT|nt|mariner1: trump lead as good as any here........ he looks Zugzwang on the opening lead|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ady: Forester m  ust be carefull to p lay 8@H 2nd time if playing from hand|pg||
nt|phil_20686: does not matter, North has no smaller ones left in any event|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but doesnt 4S make|pg||
nt|henryb: will in fact|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now we know double dummy that declarer can take all the tricks -- but at Imps -- first find line to ensure 11 tricks|pg||
nt|mariner1: he heard the @H cue so no @H and @c nor @D looks attractive|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mariner1: 1st mistake would be assuming you have 4 @c tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or even 2 :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: true|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|ady: does not matter as AJ109 now in north hand|pg||
nt|cliveo: Some people might think this defence is routine, but time after time the Irish are so accurate in these situations|pg||
pc|cA|nt|xenya: actually it's not a great slam, looking at NS's hands|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: and as here -- how do you feel if 3@C all pass?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: point for the audience -- sometimes preempts make bidding tough|pg||
nt|woozle: 3C all pass is fine - you're facing club length and probably make nothing|pg||
nt|woozle: A crossruff probably falls into 9 tricks here|pg||
nt|woozle: although West's diamond 8 may be a problem on the fourth round of hearts|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|phil_20686: North should probably have played one of the JT9 as a matter of technique on teh first round of hearts, but a minor slip|pg||

mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|idblu: vul not right|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ahollan1: North had 2-way checkback available, so this sequence of 1@S/2@H = weak hand|pg||
nt|idblu: a @H lead would be double dummy....but just wishful thinking|pg||

nt|vugraphzgj: connection lost in closed room - running results to office to update - hopefully have ths resolved soon|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so close -- good cash of @DK, bad non-spade ruff before @H ruff [ending in dummy for trump coup]|pg||

mb|p|nt|cliveo: I believe Forrester is the most capped English player in the Camrose series. When I was in my 20s and lived in Wakefield I had the pleasure of playing with Tony on a Monday and ...|pg||
nt|cliveo: Brian Senior on a Tuesday, and have lived to tell of the experience!|pg||
nt|henryb: what do these people play is 1N-2@s|pg||
nt|sga1: yes. May play 3@d|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S has good play here.......|pg||
nt|by: note that N, E, and W are three of taiwan's U26 team that made it to the semis 2008 in beijing, S is W's old partner who place 3rd with him in bandung 2007 PABF U26|pg||
nt|woozle: very good play once the heart ace is onside|pg||
mb|2H|nt|jcomyn: here we go early on a 9-count|pg||
nt|cliveo: John, can you tell us where Garvey and Carroll are based, and whether they play in competitions together outside of internationals?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: still should have been 1 diamond left to dispose of round loser :(|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil_20686: How close do the panel think this is to a 3@c bid?|pg||
mb|p|nt|cliveo: Once again the aggressive tactics of the Irish have kept the Welsh out of the bidding, though the Welsh have 24 points and a probable heart game|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil_20686: Feels close to me, the Kx@s looks like a big holding now|pg||
nt|ady: 6 NT  or 6@C   or 6@S all make    not 6@D|pg||
nt|cliveo: We all know how fine a player Tony is, but he is a particularly strong declarer|pg||
nt|ady: there is a danger of 6@D here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I don't think so|pg||
nt|ady: if Martin gets diamond preference   he might back peddle with a jack high suit|pg||
nt|phil_20686: North will offer 6@c as a matter of course, almost irrespective of how the auction develops|pg||
nt|henryb: 5@d is also reasonable|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i like the 3-card @S raise|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Kieran wins the cupie doll -- i hoped someone would mention 1@C with balanced and transfer responses|pg||
nt|woozle: I usually play 2NT after 1x-1y:2y as a 1-round force, after which 3 card raises bid out shape|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N is overbid - punishes partner for opening sub-strength distrbutional hands|pg||
nt|mariner1: my guess is he played out all the trumps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but reopening DBL with that @H holding is .... non-optimal|pg||
pc|c9|nt|jcomyn: yes TG is in England and JC works in Dublin. No they dont play too often outside internationals. In fact John won the Irish Masters playing with Adam Mesbur|pg||
nt|ahollan1: have any of you played the follow-up to determine if opener has made 3 or 4 card raise?|pg||
nt|woozle: my style rebids 1NT (or opens 1C and plays transfer responses) - I like the raise to suggest four so that partner can jump to game more often|pg||
pc|cK|nt|Walddk4: N-S are women   Sheila - Anne|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mariner1: Q@H is an imaginative lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure anybody follows this anymore, but I learned bidding after reopening DBL to first subtract a King, then bid accordingly|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|cliveo: I think it unlikely they will bid a slam as with the first set yesterday evening, the cards do lie well for declarer|pg||
nt|phil_20686: (provided only that they get to the 6 level)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hmm -- i hadn't seen the 1 round force treatment before |pg||
nt|ahollan1: duh -- 2N as 1-round force|pg||
nt|mariner1: I like to play 2@C asking over a major, outlawed by ACBL until recently|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that makes West a solid 1N bid|pg||
nt|mariner1: p did bid them so reasonable..... and N has no entry|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mariner1: sort of like drury in but also in 1st and 2nd seat|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Rob -- you mean like Gazzilli?|pg||
pc|h2|pc|c8|pc|c4|pg||
nt|ady: now South should get the message and if going to the 6 level  clubs rather than diamonds|pg||
nt|cliveo: what do we make of the 3@d bid - agreeing the suit, or a cue-bid? or even something else?|pg||
nt|mariner1: no|pg||
nt|woozle: 4S now has an overtrick on the menu|pg||
pc|h8|nt|phil_20686: This hand shows the powed of the mixed cue, the k@c is such a big card in the north hand, Many club players still play cues as ace showing, which is inferior|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's natural where I come from|pg||
nt|phil_20686: she just showed a GF raise in diamonds|pg||
pc|hT|nt|sga1: They r playing 2@s as Baron.|pg||
nt|sga1: I mean 1N - 2@s|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|henryb: declarer should actually play a second high heart, then @cA and a @c. |pg||
nt|mariner1: he has time to setup the @c for 2 tricks now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: at this vulnerability - with that @H holding, East knows that West does not have strong hand hoping to defend, so pass and defend well for 100 a trick is much better plan|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|h7|nt|phil_20686: could even be 4@d depending on their agreement for inverted minors|pg||
nt|phil_20686: and that pass was unexpected|pg||
nt|cliveo: Well that shows how much we understood of their sequence!|pg||
nt|cliveo: Perhaps the key is that 4@c was not alerted, whereas 2@h, 3@s, 4@h and 4@s all were|pg||
nt|phil_20686: Pass is clearly anti-system, after that many cue bids, but south is worred about her poor diamonds, and opted to get out in a positive|pg||
nt|ady: crouch & Liggins in 6@D   swing for Scotland |pg||
pc|h4|pc|hJ|pc|h3|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: i only see 10 :(|pg||

nt|brgpro: easier for precision to reach it|pg||
nt|idblu: I am talking on opening lead :)|pg||

mb|2D|an|weak two bid|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|idblu: Joey beat them to the wk 2|pg||

nt|mariner1: 3@D now by S?|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DIRECTOR -- 2007 Senior Bowl convention card for EW says 2@D=3-9 HCP, both Majors|pg||
nt|idblu: yes ...2@S now implies a better hand|pg||
mb|d|nt|brgpro: Sun is not the player to be pre-emted|pg||

mb|p|mb|6C|an|!sQ + !cK or !h+!dK|mb|p|nt|brgpro: then S might think of this lucky 7|pg||
nt|brgpro: however, she is worried about @cKxx|pg||
nt|ahollan1: after double -- it is nice for partnership to have understanding of North's  3@S versus Pass|pg||
nt|mariner1: 6@C shows Q@S and K@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: many would say 3@S = worst 2@S overcall|pg||
nt|brgpro: even if she gives another try with 6@d, N will decline it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's an extension to RKC Queen ask I've never seen|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|nt|brgpro: very popular nowadays|pg||
nt|mariner1: so sort of a Roman answer to the Queen ask|pg||
mb|p|nt|brgpro: answering the Q with side Ks|pg||
mb|p|nt|idblu: well done to get there|pg||
nt|santyclz: Yes, but 1st time I've seen "either this k or the 2 others."|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but it was either specifically @CK or both Red Kings -- that's the  part i've never seen|pg||
nt|brgpro: operator, pls change S name to Wang Hong Li|pg||
nt|mariner1: in Closed NS got to 6@S in 2 bids|pg||
nt|brgpro: it is H not G|pg||
nt|brgpro: domo:)|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ahollan1: the key was 3rd round of @C -- but i don't think Eddie Kantar is planning another edition of RKCB |pg||
nt|idblu: what do u bid with the round K's|pg||
nt|mariner1: in Closed  2@S - 2N - 3@C - 6@S  easy|pg||
nt|idblu: so a push...|pg||
nt|brgpro: S was concerned that N didnt accept when she cue bid 3@d, so...|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|pc|d7|pg||
nt|brgpro: she took a conservative view, besides, there is no way to find out Kxx or Kx|pg||
nt|ahollan1: would forcing 3@C instead of 3@D have worked better?|pg||

nt|ahollan1: or maybe just one round :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @S7 is HUGE|pg||
nt|brgpro: safer|pg||

nt|henryb: you may be able to avoid the @s finesse|pg||
nt|ahollan1: don't tell me -- @C spots good enough for no loser|pg||
nt|mariner1: in a match this close every trick counts|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i may have convinced myself that North should forcing NT regardless of vul|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: don't be surprised if +150 loses a couple of imps [compared to 1@H going down 2 or 3]|pg||
mb|2S|nt|henryb: can they avoid a really silly game?|pg||
nt|woozle: indeed, after the c8 switch|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: EW can make 4@S with CAREFUL play......|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|ady: part score in diamonds   |pg||
nt|cliveo: to return to the question of selection, and I know how difficult it is because I was chairman of a rugby selection committee for over 5 years, there has been a lack of consistency ...|pg||
nt|cliveo: in the selection of the England teams. For example Bell and Byrne were not selected for the U28 team in Beijing, and yet have been selected for the England B open team, where ...|pg||
nt|cliveo: indeed they showed their ability yesterday with a very good first 16 boards against the A team|pg||
nt|jcomyn: these tactics won buckets of imps against Scotland - or is it bouquets of imps|pg||
nt|cliveo: Again, they have 24 points between them, but this time Rees was able to get into the action before the Irish had a chance!|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: @c good lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wow - red vs white, 2.5+ cover cards -- i think i'd try 4@S|pg||
mb|3C!|an|CK or CA|nt|ady: 3 @D limit|pg||
nt|jcomyn: Spelt Filip I believe sorry about that|pg||
nt|cliveo: Don't worry, there are very few Welsh speakers about|pg||
nt|woozle: 2h rebid is 4 hearts, longer clubs?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Bo -- can you translate?|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil_20686: Do we know what these bids mean?|pg||
mb|6S|nt|jcomyn: gone crazy again|pg||
nt|sga1: Yes. they may play 3@d.|pg||
nt|mariner1: now S in a spot|pg||
nt|xenya: i certainly would |pg||
nt|mariner1: yes 4 @S looks reasonable to me too......|pg||
nt|ahollan1: declarer much better off if he knows about the @C10 lead - i.e. can it be from interior sequence or not|pg||
nt|ahollan1: IF possibly interior sequence, @C6 would have been good shot -- 2 minutes ago|pg||
mb|p|nt|cliveo: The bidding sequences of our top players are so different to the sequences played at our local clubs that it is very difficult for aspiring players to learn from the experts|pg||
nt|mariner1: @D lead here makes this tough|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: then 3C 2425?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 1@H  re-bid shows spades I think|pg||
nt|henryb: harder if you play 2/1 gf. but then you respond 1N|pg||
nt|sga1: yes.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|cliveo: I agree, otherwise the sequence makes no sense|pg||
nt|phil_20686: I have always found it easy - just ask, top players are normally happy to help, and they all played natural systems once|pg||
nt|jcomyn: will they find it again?|pg||
nt|cliveo: If the Irish keep up their impressive form on defence, this contract will be 1 off after the first four tricks|pg||
nt|jcomyn: Tommy may lead a S however|pg||
nt|cliveo: And as we can see, Ireland got 11 IMPs back on Board 3 through the aggressive tactics of Garvey and Carroll in this room|pg||
nt|vugraphzgj: Carroll tried to lead OOT but Rees stopped him :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: sure he did before CJ hit the table|pg||
nt|vugraphzgj: exactly|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jcomyn: which Ace is the problem|pg||
nt|jcomyn: looking for a signal|pg||
pc|h8|nt|cliveo: yes, but unless you meet the top players personally to speak to them, that is not available to the ordinary club player|pg||
nt|jcomyn: quick arent they|pg||
nt|sharynr: :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: H3 may ask for a Club - dont know|pg||
nt|mariner1: EW play MOSCITO|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|woozle: now some sort of control ask?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|cliveo: Reverse attitude?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: perhaps|pg||
nt|jcomyn: now DA and again signal|pg||
nt|jcomyn: process of elimination|pg||
nt|cliveo: According to the convention card, a high card is discouraging|pg||
nt|cliveo: Convention cards for all the pairs playing this weekend can be found at http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2007/camroseteams.htm|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ahhh -- non-transfer moscito|pg||
nt|woozle: West has plenty of controls, maybe 3H showed a min|pg||
nt|ahollan1: of all the red suits -- that @H3 and @HQ were the only ones NOT worth consideration|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ady: 3@D  was a bit pushy on such a tepid suit   |pg||
nt|ahollan1: Kieran - are you a Mosciot convert?|pg||
pc|d7|nt|sga1: on a trump lead and continuation, real problem for declarer.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or even Moscito|pg||
nt|woozle: No, but I have played relay before|pg||
nt|woozle: looks fairly vanilla|pg||
nt|ahollan1: are these basically Symmetric Relay based?|pg||
nt|woozle: looks like symmetric|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|jcomyn: oh dear he let me down|pg||
pc|dA|nt|woozle: Not sure about the last two bids by West though - he's loaded with controls, I would have thought he'd be taking up more steps|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d8|nt|henryb: now a @h towards dummy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: while bidding continues - my favorite relay story -- 1st hand of 2007 Reisinger, kibitzing Burgess-Marston|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they used ALL bids between 1@C and 2N -- BOTH opponents ran out of PASS cards|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good morning to Jim Hay from Scotland|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ahh: morning everyone |pg||
nt|woozle: My favourite, B-M again, is where they relayed to the five level without skipping a step. At that point, Burgess realised that they were both relaying, figured out what he'd shown ...|pg||
nt|woozle: and what Marston needed to keep bidding for so long, and placed the contract correctly|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sA|nt|henryb: should have pitched @c|pg||
nt|ahollan1: more than bidding accuracy, relay may gain more just on increasing blind opening lead syndrome|pg||
pc|s4|pg||

pc|d9|nt|cliveo: Good morning, Jim. Has the sun risen in Aberdeen yet?|pg||

nt|cliveo: their results|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s6|pg||
nt|woozle: It's often inferior when the replier has extra playing strength, or when the described hand is going to be declarer|pg||
pc|c3|nt|cliveo: there are obviously a lot of good people in Scotland then|pg||
nt|ahh: pleased to see our debut girls holding their own against   Englands strike  pair |pg||

nt|sga1: NS will buy the contract.|pg||
nt|henryb: fortunately North will rescue him|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right - why risk establishing dummy's suit when dummy has all of those entries|pg||
nt|mariner1: on14 they only bid to 4@S in Open so no big swing,,,,, maybe an imp or 2|pg||
mb|4H|nt|Walddk4: 2@D presumably intermediate|pg||
nt|woozle: although 3NT may appeal to East, and it dies a quick death if fruitman finds a big heart|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharynr: I guess NS play sound overcalls|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: 5@D is pretty good|pg||
nt|cliveo: how would you rate the 3NT by Sime-Matheson on board 4?|pg||
nt|ahh: is that a weak strong jump or a strong weak jump ?|pg||
nt|sharynr: and NS did wel to score plus here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in [more] obnoxious days -- we would have described 2@S as "showing the values for a 2@S bid in this sequence"|pg||
nt|mariner1: he may cash a @H to look I would|pg||
nt|woozle: AKx often a great lead against 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: boy oh boy|pg||
nt|cliveo: Surely Kurbalija hasn't passed here?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|cliveo: yesterday, Townsend-Gold described their jumps as 'strongish', but they had 13 points|pg||
nt|cliveo: At my club even the LOLs would be jumping on the table|pg||
nt|cliveo: OK, that makes more sense|pg||
nt|sga1: Only 2@c makes for NS.|pg||
nt|henryb: and Wast will rescue North|pg||
nt|sga1: He did.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ahh: hopefully better than the 1st board they played yesterday |pg||
nt|sga1: With a ratchet suit, he bids again after doubling.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S looks like automatic response to me -- but if you take away a King, then bypass the suit|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ahh: 3nt -3|pg||
nt|Walddk4: why?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: oh, not this one|pg||
nt|ahh: ok it was  just only -2 |pg||
nt|phil_20686: I think openeing Sime's hand with that suit is poor|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 3NT is an awful contract, but it makes|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You actually need spades 6-3 with no entry to the long suit|pg||
nt|cliveo: does it definitely make on a @s lead?|pg||
nt|phil_20686: or the @d finesse working|pg||
nt|phil_20686: but that is anti-% given the bidding|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Right Clive, North can switch to hearts after 2 rounds of spades|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But will that happen?|pg||
nt|woozle: Big missed opportunity for NS|pg||
nt|xenya: 12 tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: move a small @C from declarer's hand to smal @S -- and 4@S is much better contract than 4@H|pg||
nt|mariner1: I suspect 11 :)|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|cliveo: A kibbitzer has suggested two rounds of @s and a @h switch defeats the contract|pg||
pc|d3|nt|cliveo: Yes, it is easier in double dummy!|pg||
nt|cliveo: If Garvey makes all the right guesses, this is a good vulnerable save against a making non-vulnerable game|pg||
nt|vugraphzgj: sorry thought I had clicked on X but must have been slightly off|pg||
pc|d7|nt|mariner1: so now he makes extras|pg||
nt|ahollan1: here -- the long/strong trump suit it getting tapped|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|phil_20686: He would be absolutely correct, but could be letting it through if east has Kxx@Hrather than Kx|pg||
nt|ahh: well for sure this start will not beat it |pg||
nt|mariner1: on 14 4@S only made 4@S so Mixed won an important imp|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but all roads would lead to 4@H so - i'll defer to Vlad and Rob to examine the play|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|woozle: 11 tricks, unless he gets greedy and tries to endplay South|pg||
pc|s3|nt|cliveo: I have to say, I find this quite remarkable. It is well outside my ability range to find this sacrifice|pg||
nt|henryb: He may be forced at the two level after doubling. I would be|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|nt|ahh: reasonable with no entries to try and help partner beat it |pg||
nt|phil_20686: i think a @c is what i would have led on this auction|pg||
nt|jcomyn: thats their style clive|pg||
nt|cliveo: Mind you, he still has to get the diamond and heart position correct|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|h4|nt|jcomyn: oops|pg||
nt|cliveo: Now the methods have cost them. But not much, unless he gets the hearts wrong as well|pg||
pc|h7|nt|xenya: not much to examine here|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
pc|h6|nt|cliveo: In fact, we can see that the Irish pair bid to 6@c going one off, so this is going to be a bad board for Ireland whatever happens|pg||
pc|h9|nt|cliveo: you are not an advocate of fourth highest of your longest and strongest suit, then?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3 imps with 8 to play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 10 to compare|pg||
pc|hK|nt|sga1: I mean for West. He need not have bid.|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|d4|pc|c5|nt|xenya: declarer can't help making 6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and everything right for declarer|pg||
pc|h2|pc|dT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: as far as black Q location - but not in suit split - so lose a black card or let west score trump |pg||
nt|mariner1: beginning to look like 12,,,,,,,, if so Vlad buys the beer!|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hT|nt|ahollan1: belay that -- club spots are right so no loser there|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but Cheng should play @CQ on 2nd round of the suit if holding was Q106 or Q6|pg||
pc|s4|mc|12|nt|phil_20686: looks normal, @s is a reasonable alternative, but like you say with no entry its not appetising. Then again, after the failure to double 3@c, perhaps a spade lead would apeal|pg||

mb|p|nt|brgpro: but will Wang open?|pg||
nt|santyclz: But they wouldn't have if you hadn't protected against it.|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|brgpro: she could open 1@d, or 2@c...|pg||
nt|ahollan1: exactly Fred|pg||
nt|vugraphzhp: after a long pause, she didn't.|pg||
nt|brgpro: or pass as she did|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cJ|nt|brgpro: open 1@d will not allow her to rebid 2@c the next turn, must be 1NT|pg||
nt|mariner1: many precision teams would open S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think she had to open one or the other -- Pass is anti-system|pg||
nt|brgpro: and opening 2@c with this suit is not good either|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not many -- i think automatic|pg||
pc|cK|nt|brgpro: so she chose to pass although they almost open all the 11 balanced|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c2|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|pc|dQ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|mariner1: NV vs VUL is another reason to open S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: when flipping coin between 1@D and 2@C -- only landing on edge = pass|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d4|pc|dK|pc|d3|pg||
nt|mariner1: in Closed S opened 1@C... W 1@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C also has preemptive effect|pg||
nt|brgpro: but NS can make 3@c here and never got in|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes and it might miss lead EW on play if they win the bid|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hK|nt|ahollan1: @C suit is weak, but 6th card in suit - would make 2@C easy choice for me - especially since 1@D=0+|pg||

nt|sharynr: a slam hand for EW|pg||
nt|sharynr: but VERY difficult to get there|pg||
nt|jcomyn: dont thnk so|pg||
nt|jcomyn: are we back?|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Welcome to Ciaran Coyne|pg||
nt|ciaran: hi all|pg||
nt|sharynr: hi|pg||
nt|vugraphzgj: sorry folks.  big internet issues here - doing our best to get this fixed.  entering details in office at the moment|pg||
nt|jcomyn: Howya Ciaran|pg||
nt|sharynr: hopefully we will see some bridge soon|pg||
nt|jcomyn: Dublin|pg||
nt|cliveo: In fact the last undertrick only cost 2 IMPs because of the result in the open room|pg||
nt|jcomyn: when he isnt off playing poker somewhere|pg||
nt|vugraphzgj: Garvey is shaking his head|pg||
nt|woozle: big double-fit hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i have some descriptions of the line -- weird is one with acceptable letter count|pg||
mb|p|nt|cliveo: In the open room, Board 5, they are playing in 3@d, so another swing to England|pg||
nt|woozle: NS make 3C or maybe 3S...EW make 11 tricks in either red suit|pg||
mb|1C|nt|mariner1: 2@H Micheals now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the downside of Michaels -- North doesn't know - and in fact doubts there is a @C fit|pg||
mb|1S|nt|jcomyn: excerllent slam here|pg||
nt|henryb: double by N?|pg||
nt|mariner1: EW can make 4@H....|pg||
nt|woozle: I'm not much of a fan of this style of Michaels - I'd have no idea whether to take another bid. 1S leaves you with much better information about your partner's hand|pg||
nt|mariner1: even 5@H|pg||
mb|2N|nt|cliveo: It does show that with modern technology pairs can be very effective even though they live significant travelling distances from each other|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes they do a fair bit of work on the internet - the whole teram doers|pg||
nt|cliveo: We can see the Welsh pair got a good result in the open room|pg||
nt|jcomyn: team does|pg||
nt|woozle: 2S: Anything you can cue I can cue better|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahh: if you always made the best opening lead  you would be worlds number 1 player for sure |pg||
nt|cliveo: Their international results show that hard work pays dividends, too|pg||
nt|jcomyn: not if 6H is bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Italians use Ghestem -- where they would show the 2 specific suits in one bid [but don't ask me which]|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: same start in open room|pg||
nt|woozle: Going fancy could cost a bit - 4H would have probably bought it; 3D might let North back in|pg||
mb|p|nt|cliveo: At the moment, when Bakhshi-Forrester play in a game, Sime-Matheson play in a part score, and vice versa|pg||
nt|cliveo: With any other pair, one would say highly unlikely. But with the way Garvey and Carroll have bid so far this session, who knows?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 5s pushes them to 6H|pg||
nt|cliveo: Rees may live to regret his bid|pg||
nt|henryb: no. we seem to be in the business of rescuing the opponents when they are in trouble|pg||
nt|sga1: He preferred 2@h|pg||
pc|s6|nt|sga1: :)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jcomyn: and finish|pg||
nt|sharynr: and he buys very well!|pg||
nt|cliveo: Although, 6@s is a good save over 6@h :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: unless dbl of course|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ahh: this could have been sneaky 3nt on @S lead |pg||
nt|cliveo: we have a player in the north east called Bill March. If you ever find a lead other than fourth highest of your longest and strongest against 3NT you get many congratulations!|pg||
nt|ahh: but on non @S lead not so hot |pg||
nt|mariner1: I would bid a game as W|pg||
nt|ahollan1: endplayed at trick 1 :(|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|jcomyn: oops again|pg||
nt|cliveo: A lot of IMPs depend on Carroll's next bid|pg||
nt|mariner1: EW have 3N here no problem.. number of tricks only issue|pg||
nt|xenya: i can see 10|pg||
pc|s5|nt|jcomyn: this is not good at all|pg||
nt|cliveo: And unfortunately for Ireland, in the negative column|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mariner1: Zugzwang on the lead again :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Paul Marston would say - lead @H instead of @S -- Canape Leads - very interesting article from way back in last millenium|pg||
pc|sK|nt|woozle: how could he know that his diamond honours are working... maybe there's some kind of clue|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this a lotta imps|pg||
nt|jcomyn: TG will be shaking his head again|pg||
nt|cliveo: A club from Garvey takes the contract two off|pg||
nt|cliveo: Provided Carroll then plays a diamond to the Ace and there is a second club ruff|pg||
pc|sT|nt|mariner1: only a @c continuation allows 6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: looks as thought West would have bid 2@S over 2@H or 1@S|pg||
nt|woozle: 2H over 1S might work as an asking bid - asking the opponents how many spades your partner has|pg||
pc|c3|pc|s8|pc|sA|pg||
nt|cliveo: Not surprisingly, he played the Ace of diamonds first. Now will he find the club?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: he better|pg||
nt|cliveo: If he does, they lose 12 IMPs. If he doesn't, 17|pg||
nt|cliveo: Assuming, of course, my maths is correct!|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cK|nt|jcomyn: 17 it is|pg||

pc|d8|nt|ahh: 800  not so bad even v 680|pg||

nt|jcomyn: asking anything else to say. Now 4C may get them there|pg||

nt|henryb: North was on my wavelength|pg||
nt|mariner1: so 2 instead of 7.......|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dA|nt|cliveo: According to their convention card, 3@s shows a singleton|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS can make 5@C|pg||

pc|d4|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S cetainly made life difficult for e/w|pg||
nt|cliveo: not easy to bid a slam, even over a 3@s opener|pg||

nt|ahh: Scotlands slam bidding traditionally  has  been    well lets be generous about it  less than ept |pg||
nt|vugraphzgj: Adamson says "this might not be the dummy of your dreams"|pg||

pc|h6|nt|mariner1: yes 4@H should make too|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what did 3@S accomplish?  was it a probe for 3N?   |pg||

pc|h4|nt|cliveo: Anyone have any idea what 3NT means?|pg||

nt|idblu: and the @D 10|pg||
nt|mariner1: well chose the less (to me) likely small @S|pg||
nt|mariner1: choose|pg||
nt|idblu: Joey looking for swings ?|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @H lead more passive, but declarer should still scrounge up 9 tricks|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|nt|mariner1: could be,,, lead makes the contract easier though it always should make|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d6|pg||
nt|mariner1: in Closed 3N also and 9@H led|pg||
nt|brgpro: @s lead makes sense after S responded 2@d|pg||
nt|santyclz: I've just been informed by a reliable source, Muriel Dalphond (Joey's wife), that the reason he's called Joey rather than Joe or Joseph is because he's as cute as a baby kangaroo.|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h4|nt|ahollan1: Jack - auction certainly discourages @D -- but is it powerful enough for attacking @S rather than passive @H?|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h3|pg||
nt|idblu: if he would only get rid of that fake cigarette he chews on|pg||
nt|mariner1: if p has spades he doesn't have much for an entry...... so I lead @H..... if I lead @S|pg||
nt|mariner1: maybe the Q@S|pg||
pc|d4|nt|brgpro: well, he wants to lead more aggressively|pg||

nt|jcomyn: some hands we have this morning|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nite Kieran|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS have 3N if they get there|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@H bid with Qxx would have been weird|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharynr: will not most likely take @S and @h finesses ?|pg||
nt|cliveo: Denning/Shields will have been disappointed to have missed the slam as they are usually accurate on this type of hand|pg||
nt|henryb: wierd!|pg||
nt|sga1: I was saying for Board 7.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahh: quite happy sniping from the side lines and helping our juniors |pg||
nt|cliveo: After all the excitement of the past boards, this looks like a routine 4@s contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzgj: they've been great hands all weekend|pg||
nt|henryb: I know|pg||
nt|sga1: ok|pg||
nt|xenya: true but might happen|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|sga1: 6@s may be bid by East in competition.|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|mariner1: time for 3N|pg||
nt|mariner1: on 16 3@S here they bid 4 @S in Open...... made 5 here|pg||
mb|2D|nt|sharynr: playing for a heart diamond squeeze would do it, yes|pg||
nt|ciaran: probably cashed out and made 12 when @HQ dropped|pg||
nt|sga1: N may have realised and passed 5@s.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: checkback?   blast 4@H |pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: true although the first half of Ireland v EBU hands were dull enough|pg||
nt|cliveo: Yes, with the exception of one session where there was a succession of part scores, there has been a lot to keep us interested|pg||
nt|vugraphzgj: I'm wearing out my alert button :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hmm or 3@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: South really doesn't want to play @H unless Opener has 4 -- so I prefer checkback if it is available|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|ahh: practical shot from Ann|pg||
nt|ady: 11 tricks in hearts     spade lead will come   so no chance of a slam slipping through|pg||
nt|cliveo: Ann is consistent in her bidding style with long suits|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hope they dont get any rushes of blood to the head here|pg||
nt|cliveo: In the other matches, England are losing to Northern Ireland, whereas the England B team have a comfortable lead over Scotland|pg||
nt|xenya: S might be considering a @D conract -- well both 3N and 5@D make|pg||
nt|mariner1: BTU mixed is about to take the lead|pg||
nt|mariner1: 16 was a 9 imp swing and a new leader, still very close|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what do you think of north's 2@S bid?  i'm trying to decide if 3@H or 3@C had merits [i.e. why introduce bad 4 card suit when partner known not to hold 4@S - else negative DBL]|pg||
nt|mariner1: danger here is S is trying to talk himself out of something.........|pg||
nt|ahollan1: are either of these 'mixed' NS players female?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahh: opps bidding warned her off getting too high |pg||
nt|phil_20686: Slam looks awfully far away if partner cannot find a bid over 2@s, so no real danger in just bidding game|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and i meant blast 4@S|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4 of either major works|pg||
nt|mariner1: do not know|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: I must confess I would not overcall 4@h. I think North's hand is far too strong|pg||
pc|h9|nt|mariner1: has to avoid 2 @H losers|pg||
nt|xenya: N's name looks like a female one|pg||
nt|mariner1: a pair of I don't have this suit cue bids :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzgx: S: female N: Male|pg||
pc|hT|nt|jcomyn: I smell 4NT|pg||
nt|cliveo: England have had a very poor record in recent years at the Camrose and now we have the B team leading the A team!|pg||
nt|cliveo: Indeed as the scores stand at the moment, the England B team is hot on the heels of Ireland|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes but you wouldnt call the EBU weak now would you|pg||
pc|h2|nt|xenya: oh |pg||
nt|ahollan1: thanks operator!|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|d4|nt|cliveo: You say that John, but interestingly Bell and byrne, for example, were not considered strong enough to play in the U28 team at Beijing, but were selected for this event|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and has to avoid losing transportation before @S established|pg||
pc|d6|nt|xenya: walking on thin ice now? |pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm intrigued by this hand -- have absolutely no idea about potential nuances|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|cliveo: I am not criticising that selection, because Byrne in particular has a very impressive record with a wide variety of partners, but in our Premier League his team did not qualify ...|pg||
nt|cliveo: for the A division|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: definitely best that East is on lead |pg||
pc|h8|pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: cashing @DA doesn't hurt at all - @S makes setting up that suit easy -- @C pitch @D|pg||
nt|mariner1: well they found a spot.....|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mariner1: 17 produced 1 imp so now a 3 imp match|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|phil_20686: right i will take this opportunity to get some ribena|pg||
nt|jcomyn: so there yar and they beat England in the first round|pg||
nt|mariner1: so in control now|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sga1: absolutely. Basically a 4 loser hand only with rough LTC.|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s4|nt|cliveo: It does show how difficult a selector's job is, and I have great sympathy with them because I was once chairman of a rugby selection committee for five years, and received the odd ...|pg||
nt|cliveo: criticism myself|pg||
nt|ahollan1: among other things -- did RDBL suggest a @H stopper or just stronger hand|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|henryb: but then at my table the auction would start P-1@h-1@s-2@h|pg||
nt|xenya: i would assume the latter|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hQ|nt|ahollan1: me too - so south never did show a stopper -- a puzzlement|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s8|nt|ahollan1: nice try with @HQ but it won't matter|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ahh: a junior drinking ribena  what on earth has the world come to ?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: i would have tried @H ruff first --- does it matter in the end?|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d8|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes selectors are NEVER right especially in bridge asd we are all the best players in the world|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sK|nt|xenya: perhaps S just didn't have time to show the stopper -- looks like 3@C shows shortage and 3@S completed the description of her hand |pg||
nt|ahollan1: if 2nd @D -- dummy's Q |pg||
pc|sA|pc|s9|pg||

pc|s2|nt|brgpro: as long as it is not a @d, the contract will go down|pg||

nt|jcomyn: Hughe is not as green as he is cabbage-looking I assure you|pg||
nt|cliveo: We were discussing this during another match yesterday, and the conclusion was that the consistency of the Irish selection has a lot to do with its success|pg||
nt|jcomyn: ah part score at last|pg||
nt|vugraphzgj: East aplologising for not bidding six!|pg||

mb|p|nt|cliveo: a teetotal scottish junior? whatever next!|pg||
nt|ady: not much difficulty here|pg||
nt|phil_20686: i think 5N will come out of the box here|pg||
nt|cliveo: yes, it would be a major surprise if they don't play in 6NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: not selected Clive - they murdered the winners of our prelim trials in the final trial|pg||
nt|henryb: 6@h cold from N chair|pg||
pc|s2|nt|cliveo: If the Welsh pair outbid the Irish on this board in the open room, it is difficult to believe Garvey and Carroll will be outbid!|pg||
nt|cliveo: whatever the methods are, the same team has played for some time|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes five years now|pg||
nt|sga1: Now we see 5@c again with a good hand.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but lose 12 much more likely|pg||
pc|s7|nt|mariner1: can NS make 4@S here?|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, but somehoww not too likely|pg||
nt|xenya: the push i meant|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ady: I dont think west should be encouraging a grand slam with that shape    likely to be at least a vital queen or king missing|pg||
nt|cliveo: I know top players don't like to use blackwood, but anyone who reached a grand on this hand needs to revisit their bidding system|pg||
nt|ady: they wont play lower than 6NT  thats for sure|pg||
nt|cliveo: your B team seemed to perform creditably in the last two Camroses, so it isn't as if you have no other good players|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|phil_20686: I think it depends largely on partners shape, if he has a 5 card suit grand rates to be fairly good I think, at any rate, with a poor min east is not accepting|pg||
nt|sga1: What these guys r bidding?|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S is not likely either|pg||
pc|cK|nt|jcomyn: true we have some verfy good players down the line, |pg||
nt|cliveo: Goodness me! Garvey-Carroll outbid on a part score!|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|cliveo: I have to say, it seems odd to me when you have such a strong team, that you have trials|pg||
nt|henryb: They play in a different world from that you and I inhabit|pg||
nt|mariner1: I agree on last hand Al, 4@S much safer spot..... NMF or checkback would have|pg||
nt|mariner1: worked|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N - showing the @D stopper :)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jcomyn: not really clive Hanlon and McGann outbid|pg||
nt|vugraphzgx: Sorry for the connection problem.|pg||
nt|sybarra: nothing you can do :(|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|phil_20686: Bakshi agrees with Edwin - that is good enough for me :)|pg||
nt|ahh: its more basic than that Phil if he doesnt have all the bullets  grand is poor |pg||
nt|sharynr: if he knows all the cards like we do, he can do the strip and endplay because of the doubleton diamond K|pg||
nt|ciaran: i guess if the previous hand - KT9xxx xxxx xx x or so was a 2S, this is a 1S :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: anyway Tom is playing it and he is even less green if a little more cabbage-looking - no he is not Annie don't worry|pg||
nt|mariner1: on 19 S opened 3@D and it went SWISH in open :)|pg||
pc|c7|nt|phil_20686: yes, but he didnt try to investigate with a combined 35-37 count|pg||
nt|ahh: if he has all the bullets theres a hole somewhere else |pg||
nt|vugraphzgj: play did not take long !|pg||
nt|cliveo: an interesting sequence. Let's say Forrester held something like A@s A@h Axxxx@d and AK@c, then 7NT would be a spread|pg||
nt|jcomyn: just joking|pg||
nt|jcomyn: he didnt go down did he?|pg||
nt|ciaran: Maybe bidding 4H is a bit pushy when partner could not act over 1S? |pg||
nt|sharynr: apparently he did|pg||
nt|vugraphzgj: official score sheet reads -1|pg||
nt|ciaran: Seems normal to go one off misguessing hearts|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 9-what Ciaran|pg||
nt|ciaran: :) maybe Tom hasn't read that book|pg||
nt|jcomyn: there we go teaching beginners and Tom ignores us|pg||
nt|cliveo: I think other players should have to demonstrate they have the ability to outperform the current team at this level|pg||
nt|cliveo: Though I know a lot of people disagree with me on selection methods|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well the players at home want trials and after all it means a 96-board practice before the camrose|pg||
nt|sga1: i believe so looking at their bidding.|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ahollan1: nasuki gets lucky to find @S tolerance!|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c9|pg||
pc|c3|nt|santyclz: Just check for waiters with red ties.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i hate to sound that critical - especially since we don't even know if NS have a checkback mechanism, but it is good point for discussion|pg||
pc|cT|pc|h8|nt|woozle: 2H herebeatable, but not on a diamond lead|pg||

nt|sga1: 4@s for NS.|pg||
nt|santyclz: A lot of cards onside for a change.|pg||
nt|mariner1: only part scores here.|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@H makes 3n makes|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahh: D  then break 4-1   bad luck |pg||
nt|ahollan1: used winners to pull a round of trump while maintaining control -- good play|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|cliveo: But they will do well to bid it with only a combined 20 count|pg||
nt|jcomyn: anyone for 1S on S hand - not me|pg||
nt|cliveo: routine for this pair, surely?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes lol|pg||
nt|cliveo: without the intervention Garvey-Carroll have methods to distinguish between voids and singletons; I don't know if the double changes that, but probably not|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: dangerous interference now|pg||
nt|cliveo: 3NT would have shown a void without the double, probably still does|pg||
nt|ahollan1: over 2/1 game force, should 3@H show solid suit and/or extra high cards?|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil_20686: grand only needs to be 57% to be a winning proposition, if you are sure your opposition will be in at least small slam, as here|pg||
mb|3S|nt|phil_20686: the magic of imps :)|pg||
nt|cliveo: assuming they are playing 20-22 you could throw in j@d and a Q and still have all the other cards I mentioned|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes it does|pg||
nt|cliveo: I think Garvey will be very interested in moving forward now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i believe moscito uses 1@C as 15+ in 1st/2nd seat but 16+ in 3rd/4th -- but i won't swear to that|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS staying out properly here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the point is -- 1@S is limited by failure to open 1@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i know my vote - what say Vlad and Rob?|pg||
nt|mariner1: this|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: the Save?|pg||
nt|mariner1: and I don't like 3@H no matter what it shows :)|pg||
nt|xenya: previous hand -- if W had refused to ruff the @CA, the contract would have been beaten?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i agree - shows self sufficient suit|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, i agree Al|pg||
nt|ahollan1: too right Vlad -- force declarer to pitch winner and the she has to ruff next trick|pg||
nt|mariner1: 19 was a double set swing and 5 more imps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: presumably 4@D is cue-bid, just coincidence that he has length -- and south knows off at least @SA|pg||
nt|mariner1: 20 may see us with a new leader though|pg||
nt|xenya: still match is very close|pg||
mb|p|nt|cliveo: Wrong again . He knows Carrolls opening style though|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well s have to be 2-2 and when does that happen these days|pg||
nt|sybarra: will not be cheap |pg||
nt|santyclz: A lot of cards offside in the save.|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes|pg||
nt|sybarra: too many |pg||
nt|woozle: sorry folks, back after my internet dropped out|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ugly hand to lead from|pg||
pc|cK|nt|jcomyn: 3 to the Q offside and bingo|pg||
nt|cliveo: A lot, yesterday!|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome back, S made the 4 @H's when we all dropped out |pg||
pc|c9|nt|mariner1: yes and @c makes the contract easy......|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ahh: Phil will not know what a redouble card looks like  for the good of the junior captains blood pressure we take them out of the bidding box |pg||
nt|cliveo: Does everyone agree with Bakhshi's redouble?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: do you want to be in it though?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: I suppose all slams that make are good slams|pg||
nt|cliveo: As the late John Collings said, any slam that makes is a good one|pg||
nt|cliveo: Glad we agree :)|pg||
nt|henryb: be back in a moment. Coffee time|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now 4@H and a disciplined pass by north gets cheers from all|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well done!|pg||
nt|xenya: nicely done|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|woozle: South showing poor technique leading the top of a doubleton trump|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pc|dA|pc|d7|pg||
nt|mariner1: well on 20 NS bid all the way to 2@S....... which will score imps but not enough|pg||
nt|xenya: a @D lead might have been awkward for declarer|pg||
nt|mariner1: that in Open|pg||
nt|ahollan1: natsuki - claim early, claim often [before anything goes wrong :) ]|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mariner1: I am assuming they make 2@S though|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ahh: yes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with doubleton trump, i would have tried @D instead of @C -- but leading from Jack is usually bad too|pg||
pc|s3|pc|d4|pg||
nt|woozle: making six now, with two diamonds pitched on clubs|pg||
nt|sybarra: can not make 6 |pg||
nt|sybarra: *now|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|nt|cliveo: This sort of hand is why bridge is not a good spectator sport|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|cliveo: Obviously Phil can't answer this question :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @SK to preserve entry to dummy -- another fine play|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|c3|nt|phil_20686: depends on their agreements i would probably just have bid 1@s|pg||
nt|cliveo: We can all see that the contract is very easy to make whereas Garvey does not know the layout of the cards|pg||
pc|c4|pc|s2|pc|cT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: either odd-even or upside-down attitude -- but @H3 sure looks like "i like @H"|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sT|nt|jcomyn: he does now|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|cliveo: Perhaps Roland should work towards having edited highlights, match of the day style!|pg||
pc|s4|nt|cliveo: how should they find the heart fit then?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: a matchpoint animal would have hooked diamond|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||

nt|idblu: Can/US :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: any idea why team name is Juice?|pg||
nt|brgpro: dont think so|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S here NS|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|brgpro: think N owes another bid...|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mariner1: that's a very good limit raise in S to me...... NS might have left door open here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: another question -- wasn't Larry Mori originally from Canada -- or maybe just under the border|pg||
nt|brgpro: i think it was N who took the conservative view, not S|pg||
nt|vugraphzhp: He is born in Japan.|pg||
nt|mariner1: I would have bid 2@D with S...... though they may not use that method|pg||

nt|jcomyn: but much of the entertainment is watching the score hand after hand|pg||
nt|santyclz: The @h guess wasn't too tough.|pg||
nt|sybarra: and 12 imps to n/s on bd 20 |pg||
nt|woozle: Now, 4S maybe making overtricks...a useless board for the trailing team|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good claim :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahh: Bakshi hand from last board has rotated 90 degrees |pg||
mb|1D|nt|jcomyn: this is like a rugby match that has a stream of scrums in the middle of the field with nothing happening|pg||
nt|cliveo: this looks like a routine 4@h contract but with the fun and games we've had at this table, who knows|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: i wonder if Zia would have played @S10 at trick 1|pg||
nt|mariner1: this is the penultimate board of the match........... score still very close|pg||
mb|p|nt|cliveo: Although as we can see, 4@s is a good save|pg||
nt|jcomyn: lets all bid each others suits|pg||
nt|cliveo: Carroll has opened another hand that most people would pass|pg||
nt|cliveo: And presumably Garvey has made some sort of game force in @h|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes but saving can be very dangerous when opps dont agree|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3@D would be my call......|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that sure would have slowed down the play|pg||
mb|2S|nt|phil_20686: your hearts don't look good with the hearts on your right, i would rather have AJxx or similar, a true finesse, conversly, your spades have improved, and your hand isnt really good ...|pg||
nt|phil_20686: enough to penalise at the one level - you don;t want to discourage the opposition from competing to 3@H - I would know what to do to that|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't understand East's DBL either|pg||
nt|mariner1: W certainly should think it shows something in a major|pg||
nt|mariner1: this is the penultimate board of this session........ next session in 30 minutes|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahh: all the girls love Tony |pg||
nt|cliveo: A distinguished kibitzer has pointed out that 4@s is not good on a @s lead|pg||
nt|cliveo: Do we know what 3@d means?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgj: no|pg||
nt|mariner1: be sure to check the vugraph schedule, lot of good one there -|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://online.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php - BBO Vugraph Schedule (set|pg||
nt|mariner1: up to show times for your area)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what system/convention has East bid 2@D?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahh: he always has lots of @D|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H  likely spot    will fail to bad trump split|pg||
nt|ady: re-doubled showing 3 hearts|pg||
nt|ahh: xx = 3 @H ?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: usuall extras whoich he dont have|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sick == this will actually work|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seeing dummy makes @H shift easy|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ahh: too quick for me David |pg||
nt|xenya: EW can make 5@C here |pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@D must show @c and @S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: top & bottom?|pg||
nt|xenya: but unlikely to bid it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: top & another??|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jcomyn: I think this may well be bid nowe that Tommy thinks hand is better than it is|pg||
nt|cliveo: I see obviously not a minimum 1@h opener!|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and TG will think his CK is well placed|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mariner1: yes when I saw the DBL did not occur to me it was penalty :)|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|jcomyn: oh well thats it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice @CA - now @D finesse|pg||
pc|c6|nt|xenya: still a 6-imp swing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i haven't seen either of those treatments in a long time|pg||
pc|c4|nt|cliveo: No, he is well attuned to the Carroll opening style|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or not :)|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ady: dont like the spade bid with 3 small  and 4 clubs to the ace|pg||
nt|ady: unusual with my typing|pg||
nt|jcomyn: you have obviously been watching this pair closely|pg||
nt|cliveo: You've been giving me a good inside line on their style!|pg||
nt|mariner1: we have a close match again...... 4 imps|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|ahh: i like this  10 bds in   5 flat boards    best scottish performance for ages |pg||
nt|phil_20686: i don't think norths double here is all that clear, perhaps they are nervoud about getting bullied out of the auction as happened to their team mates against the irish.|pg||
nt|cliveo: reverting to our theme on board 10, it is unlikely Bakhshi will expect N to hold 4@h|pg||
nt|ahh: i think its a clear double by passed hand |pg||
nt|cliveo: I don't disagree|pg||
nt|phil_20686: (and may encourage partner to sac whn its wrong) - would like to see north have more shape and not not Txxx as one of her two suits|pg||
nt|ahh: no sacrificing at  green all   by 2 passed hands |pg||
nt|cliveo: the point is, that with competitive bidding being much more aggressive these days, you don't have to assume that just because someone doubles the suits break badly with the length ...|pg||
nt|cliveo: inthe opposite hand|pg||
nt|phil_20686: you don't sac over game only jim, could easil sac in 2s-1 against 2h-1 with the north hand|pg||
nt|ahh: in Aberden if someone makes a take out double it just about guareentees length in the suit opened|pg||
nt|phil_20686: i think he will now, no one is leading a doubleton diamond on this auction surely|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but this 2 imps to BTU-cheng|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hQ|nt|cliveo: Let's hope the scrums end shortly and we move back to some open play!|pg||
pc|hK|nt|henryb: this has few chances, but remembering the 3@c contract ...|pg||
nt|sga1: Actually it will make.|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4 boards to be score however none look like big swings|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good @S exit|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: closed room coming to the misplayed vul 5@D hand now|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: @S10 may/should have suit preference overtones - confirming @H|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|sga1: Now home.|pg||
nt|sga1: Sry No.|pg||
nt|henryb: really? loks like 2@s, 1@h, 1@d and one @c to lose|pg||
nt|sga1: He has to finesse @h now.|pg||
nt|henryb: and only eight winners|pg||
pc|c3|nt|phil_20686: this does not look to be a great switch|pg||
nt|ahh: not the best time for a trump switch sadly |pg||
nt|ady: play ace and another    still no chance|pg||
nt|ady: trump switch ok   |pg||
nt|ahh: even ducking is ok |pg||
nt|ady: yes|pg||
nt|ahh: then can overruff   and play 2 more |pg||
nt|cliveo: although it might not cost giving the contract to Forrester, it seems a really strange switch when partner is known to hold hearts, and if there is a tenace position you are ...|pg||
nt|cliveo: risking giving a trick away|pg||
nt|phil_20686: still a diamond, or a spade return, would lead rather less riskily to -1|pg||
nt|phil_20686: swap the K and A of hearts, and you have just let through the contract by letting him ditch his spade honours on the top clubs|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cK|nt|ahollan1: 2nd chance to take @D finesse rejected -- i guess declarer ok with @H suit being frozen|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|s7|nt|phil_20686: spade losers that is|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes I said earlier they were only in 2@S there|pg||
pc|d3|pc|sQ|pc|s4|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ahollan1: trading @S trick for @H trick|pg||
pc|cT|pc|sT|pc|c7|pg||

nt|ahh: you see why we remove junior redouble cards now ?|pg||
nt|phil_20686: got to preserve the two for your overtrick|pg||

nt|mariner1: ALL the Taipei Operators have been EXCELLENT!|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ady: yes    4H entry|pg||
nt|cliveo: It looks as if Rees should make this for another 5 IMPs to Wales|pg||
nt|cliveo: They are building up a significant lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well - there goes the @H trick|pg||
nt|mariner1: @c lead helps a little here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: except West can't get back to hand|pg||
nt|mariner1: so maybe we will see a swing|pg||
nt|mariner1: S needs to ruff an assumed @D back and underlead @H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no - i think defense still prevails|pg||

nt|mariner1: (USA)........|pg||
pc|sT|nt|santyclz: Because so would most of us be?|pg||

nt|mariner1: not like you are wasting a trick|pg||

nt|henryb: well done|pg||

pc|d6|nt|jcomyn: well I wouldnt pass 2D with the W hand|pg||

nt|cliveo: but therefore you would expect much more consistency in the selection process|pg||

nt|sharynr: having doubled 3@S i dont see why he has to bid at all, when his partner did not cooperate|pg||
nt|ciaran: Hugh looking for an early ruff  - leading suit preference 2|pg||
pc|s8|nt|cliveo: What it does demonstrate is that if a pair plays a very aggressive style against you, your methods are put to the test|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ahh: and we hold pair trials  which encourages different pairings  getting in the team |pg||
nt|ady: england in 4@H  not doubled board 12|pg||
nt|cliveo: yes, I know some people violently disagree with me, but I think this process is seriously flawed|pg||

nt|jcomyn: Tom u mean or is it|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ciaran: yes - Tom!|pg||

nt|cliveo: England A team in a critical match last year|pg||
nt|ady: 2nd double|pg||
nt|phil_20686: Its self fulfilling clive, if you send the same 6 players to every tournament, then they will be vastly more expereinced than anyone else|pg||
nt|ady: pass brings in the points|pg||
nt|ahh: the harsh truth is that our top pairs dont work hard enough on their games |pg||
mb|p|nt|cliveo: The way this auction has progressed, one would expect the Welsh pair to bid 4@h and if the Irish pair bid 4@s one would expect them to be doubled|pg||
nt|cliveo: But my predictions have been wrong before, of course|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes but here I think nobody knows who has what at this stage|pg||
nt|cliveo: however, Rees and Kurbalija have a much more conservative style than Garvey and Carroll, so I would expect them to believe they have some defence|pg||

nt|henryb: two more boards|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ady: nice shape East|pg||
mb|3C|nt|cliveo: are you going to predict who those players will be, Phil?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|phil_20686: can I say me?|pg||
nt|phil_20686: alex wilkinson|pg||
nt|ciaran: Looks like another one that will be pretty quick|pg||
mb|p|nt|cliveo: of course you can! who will be your partner?|pg||
nt|phil_20686: paul Gipson|pg||
nt|ady: I am sure forrester will push to the 5 level    5S too high for n/s|pg||
nt|ahh: what we need is our recognised top players to recover from Pauitis  work on their games regroup and come back stronger |pg||
nt|jcomyn: indeed|pg||
nt|henryb: South will propel himself to 3N and deservedly go two down. Lucky actually since one down would be much worse|pg||
mb|p|nt|cliveo: Pauitis?|pg||
mb|p|pc|cQ|nt|cliveo: Well Mcgann Hanlon stayed out of game on a combined 26 count|pg||
nt|henryb: 1@h is an artificial force, 1@s is a further negative|pg||
pc|c6|nt|phil_20686: He is refering to the European chamionships in Pau|pg||
nt|cliveo: I once opened a 7-6 hand 1NT, albeit in 3rd position, in a match against Yorkshire|pg||
pc|cK|nt|jcomyn: as Monty used to say Just the Ten|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|phil_20686: Do we all feel that 2@s is correct here?|pg||
nt|henryb: wow, unless that is forcing|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cA|nt|cliveo: for about 5 years afterwards, whenever I played a Yorkshire pair, I got asked about the shape of my 1NT bids|pg||
nt|henryb: oh. I miscounted. Only a very good 20|pg||
nt|henryb: I had counted 24|pg||
pc|c5|nt|phil_20686: some people might double with xxx, but I like to get my fit on the table|pg||
nt|henryb: so a good stop. +90 is excellent.|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|ahh: well yesterday every NT bid seemed to have at least 1 singleton |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|cliveo: I am told in the other room N responded 1@s|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d3|nt|cliveo: Results site can be found at: http://www.swanseabridgeclub.org.uk/Camrose2009/rankinglistcopy.htm|pg||

nt|ahh: 4333 being only exception out with your NT range|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|dburn: if you hold the mouse over open Room on the screen, you do not need to be told|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ahh: any body got any idea of running score ?|pg||
pc|d7|nt|dburn: that is, the cursor rather than the actual mouse|pg||
nt|cliveo: yes, but it is nice to acknowledge friendly and helpful kibitzers!|pg||
nt|jcomyn: this is beginning to look awful bad for Ireland|pg||
nt|dburn: oh, indeed|pg||
nt|vugraphzgj: anyone know the scores in the other matches?|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|pc|dA|nt|ahh: tables have not been linked since bd 9|pg||
nt|phil_20686: 2@s gains when this comes back to you at a high level of diamonds, your hand is not worth 4 or probably not even 3@s if 3 or 4 @d comes back to you|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|d8|pc|c4|pc|dT|nt|cliveo: yes, it is amazing what some people do with their 1NT openers. I once played a 48-board match against an English international (who shall remain nameless) who opened 1NT against me ...|pg||
nt|cliveo: 6 times and he was never in the point range on the front of his convention card|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|ady: the open room well behind|pg||
pc|d6|pc|h3|pc|h5|nt|Walddk7: yes|pg||
nt|dburn: EBU lead Scotland and Northern Ireland lead England by substantial margins|pg||

nt|brgpro: some big bds coming|pg||
nt|brgpro: 7@d here|pg||
nt|mariner1: a big THANKS! to Nobuyuki Hayashi (NPC of the Japan Open team), our superb|pg||
nt|mariner1: operator, for doing an excellent job!!!|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: Many thanks to the NEC (sponsor), the JCBL and Akito Omasafor helping BBO|pg||
nt|mariner1: bring us the vugraphs!|pg||
mb|3C|an|transfer to !d|nt|ahollan1: in Japan 4-6s better than 4-8s in China?|pg||
nt|idblu: poss slam swing on 29|pg||
nt|mariner1: and thanks for their wit and insight to my co-commentators Jack Zhao (China), Al|pg||
nt|mariner1: Hollander and Joe Shair (USA), Fred Lerner (Canada), and Roland Wald|pg||
nt|mariner1: (Denmark).....I am Rob Brown (USA)........|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: Roland Wald (Denmark) is the BBO vugraph co-ordinator and works diligently at it!|pg||
nt|mariner1: Last but not least, a round of applause for our hosts: Fred, Sheri, Uday, Bill Gates,|pg||
nt|mariner1: Sharon Osberg, and David Smith. Without them there would have been no|pg||
nt|mariner1: broadcasts. Thanks a lot for creating a site that is greatly appreciated by bridge|pg||
mb|3D|nt|mariner1: lovers worldwide!|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://online.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php - BBO Vugraph Schedule (set|pg||
nt|mariner1: up to show times for your area)|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes this board could decide the match|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|an|RKCB in !d|nt|ahollan1: it's cheating a bit -- our operator is frequent non-playing captain of Japan international teams |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzhp: but not this year.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hmm -- using the transfer, I would have thought 3@H followup to show shortness would be nice treatment|pg||
nt|mariner1: slam on 29 though not likely could be important too|pg||
nt|mariner1: 29 is 4@S NS|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if you didn't notice ---  new leader|pg||
nt|idblu: one thing to bid it...another to make it :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: so 1 imp and a PUSH match!|pg||
mb|4N|an|two without|nt|mariner1: let'em tell you 1 imp does not matter :)|pg||
nt|idblu: but CHINA has a 1/2 imp carryover|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ah - even better 4@D-minorwood  |pg||
nt|santyclz: .5 imp carryover for China.|pg||
nt|idblu: tie goes to China|pg||
nt|mariner1: China actually up a 1/2 imp now|pg||
nt|mariner1: Furd you buying the RIBS! and beer? :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@D RKC here|pg||
nt|idblu: my house after the match...everyone invited :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: problem is inability to learn about the @S trick source|pg||
nt|idblu: except Gowdy, he lives across the street|pg||
mb|5C|mb|d|nt|ahollan1: Gowdy across the street but NOT invited?|pg||
nt|idblu: yep :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: :)|pg||
nt|idblu: he ate all thye ribs last time :(|pg||
nt|mariner1: why DBL 5@C here?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think i want to go back to 3@H shortness -- give North a chance to cooperate|pg||
nt|mariner1: Furd shoot him :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mariner1: 5@C likely Q ask or|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this has been a great match - players, fellow commentators, spectators and incredibly great vugraph operator|pg||
nt|idblu: Joey trying to throw a monkey wrench into their auction|pg||
nt|mariner1: the DBL just allows N to pass info cheaper|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think 4N denied trump Q|pg||
nt|santyclz: It's a pity about Gowdy, he said he lost his dinner when I explained why Joey is called Joey.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so just some sort of grand slam try|pg||
nt|mariner1: EW in 2@H also on 30|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe asking specific Kings -- or number of Kings|pg||
mb|r|mb|p|nt|mariner1: China gained 5 on 30 so this could be the match on this board|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not knowing for sure what 5@C is, it is hard to interpret North's Pass or South's options|pg||
nt|idblu: 5@S will be big here|pg||
nt|brgpro: this is the deciding bd...the ladies need to bid grand ( either 7N or 7@d) to be sure of a win|pg||
nt|idblu: that will tell a hugh story|pg||
nt|ahollan1: speaking of Gowdy -- here's John's slant on the auction "the x is a meathod test  are they on same wave length  ropi etc"|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS are in 3N on 31 too need to make 5 to stay in place|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i hear music in the background -- is it theme from Jaws, or other just a drum roll|pg||
nt|santyclz: Whose lead?|pg||
nt|vugraphzhp: while Ms. Sun is thinking, JC goes to the washroom.|pg||
nt|idblu: 5@S must be 100%|pg||
nt|idblu: tells where here cards are|pg||
nt|idblu: her|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it doesn't apply here, but i'm having a Victor Mollo Bridge In the Menagerie flashback  "curious, the only making slam is in the 3-2 fit"|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well it has given the other room a chance to catch up|pg||
nt|vugraphzhp: now JC is back.|pg||
nt|brgpro: it will be easier in the other room as their 1NT=15-17 and here 14-16. makes difference|pg||
mb|7D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|idblu: that is true|pg||
nt|mariner1: well a 7 imp match IF 31 was entered correctly in Closed|pg||
nt|brgpro: so the ladies managed it!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wow - pulled out a nice guess|pg||
nt|idblu: that should clinch it for China |pg||
pc|c6|mc|13|nt|ahollan1: great set ladies|pg||

nt|jcomyn: last hand of this segment. Thanks to Sharyn and Ciaran and well done over there with so many problems|pg||
mb|2N!|mb|p|mb|3D!|nt|cliveo: Sandie Millership, sorry|pg||
nt|jcomyn: very interesting morning Clive|pg||
nt|golfsquash: yes, 56-21|pg||
nt|vugraphzgj: it's been spelt worse.  use your imagination!|pg||
nt|cliveo: agreed John, it has been magnificent entertainment, and I have enjoyed your witty and incisive comments|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: I am not friendly, and I was the one who told you|pg||
nt|ahh: of course its Sandie not Sandy |pg||
nt|ahh: welcome to Grumpy |pg||
nt|ahh: hi Roland |pg||
nt|ady: 4@H a good spot|pg||
mb|4D|nt|ahh: and thanks |pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|ady: forester wont be interested with his poor  heart suit and AK clubs|pg||
nt|jcomyn: oh no|pg||
nt|jcomyn: or maybe not|pg||
nt|henryb: looks like making two without breaking a sweat.|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil_20686: Sandie is teasing us|pg||
nt|jcomyn: clubs 3-3 might help|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but not a lot|pg||
nt|ciaran: Thanks all|pg||
nt|jcomyn: mind both finesses wrong is unlucky|pg||
nt|ciaran: No - does not seem to be a 12th trick available.|pg||
nt|jcomyn: unless some misdefence of some description although cant see it|pg||
mb|5C|nt|ahh: or not :)|pg||
nt|cliveo: A flat board to finish - have a good lunch everyone!|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|henryb: Anyway, I hope all 38 of you enjoyed yourselves. Thanks to the Welsh Bridge Union for arranging this, to the players for subjecting themselves to scrutiny|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahh: still cuing away |pg||
nt|henryb: To Simon Richards for a tough job well done, and to BBO for making it all possible|pg||
mb|7D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: I am surpriesed     this is a poor contract|pg||
nt|cliveo: If Forrester takes all the right views, he could make|pg||
nt|vugraphzgj: very late alert|pg||
nt|ahh: no law against bidding poor contracts |pg||
nt|phil_20686: well well, more imps to scotland i expect, i feel west has a sign off over his splinter with AK opposite shortage -  he has bid his hand at that point I feel|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahh: no law against them making either |pg||
nt|ahh: i am sure ARF will listen and learn Phil |pg||
nt|cliveo: if he makes it, we will probably see an article in the Daily Telegraph. With an anonymous declarer, of course!|pg||
nt|ahh: :)|pg||
nt|ahh: ARF = Antony   R  Forrester |pg||
nt|cliveo: When I lived in Wakefield as a young man, I was very fortunate that the Forrester family often fed and watered me. I saw Tony's mum Jean recently. Indeed, my wife and I played with ...|pg||
nt|cliveo: ehr in a teams competition. Though she is in her early 80s, she still plays a mean game, and indeed we almost won the competition|pg||
nt|ady: he may try to ruff club suit good     this line may fail    can make bringing the spades in  and doing the right thing with hearts|pg||
nt|ahh: this board will take some time |pg||
nt|cliveo: yes, he needs to get the @h suit right. If he does this, his success depends on whether he plays the @h suit or the @c suit|pg||
nt|cliveo: sorry, @s suit or @c suit|pg||
nt|ahh: has to decide what he wants to pitch on @D as well |pg||
nt|phil_20686: well we have heard of Tony's Declarer play, but if he makes this one i will be impressed, surely 3-3 clubs and this heart layout is the best chance?|pg||
