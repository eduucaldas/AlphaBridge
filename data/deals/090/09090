mb|p|nt|mmmakela: I liked Piekarek's bidding, dbl promising 3 spades? then p by pd conclusion:dbl|pg||

mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|2S!|mb|p|nt|mariner1: EW have a major slam if they bid it|pg||
nt|werge: In my country, spades kan be 3-1...|pg||

mb|4C|mb|p|nt|henryb: that's just Danish Karma :)|pg||
nt|werge: He needs to guess ! s - not necessarilu 2-2|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|henryb: absent any clues, playing for 2-2 is normal|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|nt|werge: @H 5-1 is no problem, only @s must be guessed|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|xenya: also they might escape a @D lead -- not on this hand though|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 3NT?|pg||
nt|vugraphzht: yes|pg||
nt|werge: A text book hand for NOT playing 3 NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He is ectrmely lucky here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: extremely even|pg||
nt|mmmakela: guess 4cards would've represented the Q, W must have 6+ I guess|pg||
nt|Walddk2: East can't find the killing lead|pg||
nt|mariner1: fortunately E does not have a normal @S lead (for NS that is)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lestergold: Mike here from Uk|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi all|pg||
nt|werge: Best åplay mus be to try A-K of @C for a drop - and finesse in @D, if @C do´nt work|pg||
nt|henryb: Well, he could on this auction; partner is likely to have major suit length with no Stayman, and he has more help in @s|pg||
nt|vugraphzht: hi Mike|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Mike|pg||
nt|mariner1: hi Mike|pg||

nt|lestergold: hi Leonid|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hJ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|henryb: I did not say he should. I would lead a @c|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|lestergold: i see im just in time to see 3n bolt home with 5 spades off the top uncashed|pg||
nt|othered1: So would I|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, deserved result I suppose|pg||
nt|lestergold: spade lead of course quite unreasonable|pg||
nt|vugraphzht: predicts again :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Poor declarer play I think it's fair to say|pg||
nt|mmmakela: well did this really happen|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why did he have to take that finesse right away?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|henryb: no, just in time to see him go two down on a cold hand. I sort of hope|pg||
pc|s6|nt|othered1: do you really take the hook into the dangerous hand?  Certainly west is more dangerous than east|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He had plenty of time to teast clubs first|pg||
nt|Walddk2: test|pg||
pc|sT|nt|lestergold: er em what ? |pg||
pc|s4|pc|sQ|pc|s8|pg||

pc|s7|nt|mmmakela: did|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|nt|werge: QS-lead would have been bad for E/W - only one down...|pg||
nt|werge: @s|pg||
mc|7|nt|lestergold: anyone explain declarer's motivation|pg||
nt|othered1: Perhaps derived from distain for opponents?  Play is pretty insulting.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Normaly play is to cash @CAK and if the queen doesn't fall, finesse diamonds|pg||
nt|werge: It is his good right to play so - no comments necessary|pg||
nt|mmmakela: just table presence but still shd cash @C AK|pg||
nt|xenya: a major disaster for NS|pg||
nt|Walddk2: no, a NT disaster|pg||
nt|mmmakela: lol|pg||
nt|Walddk2: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzht: so|pg||
nt|henryb: a No Trump disaster. Going down in 4@h would be a major disaster:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzht: his motivation|pg||
nt|vugraphzht: is that if he will play AK @cs|pg||
nt|mariner1: well it was a Minor Disaster leading to the Major one here :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzht: hi will give to opps all info|pg||
nt|vugraphzht: and after immediately @d finesse it may be hard for W to lead spades|pg||

nt|henryb: How did he go three down?|pg||
nt|mariner1: that was to a kibber thinking the REDBL showed extras some how|pg||
nt|xenya: The last board is coming up, and a few words of gratitude are in order. First, a big thank you to our excellent operator Leonid Bayakchev -- great job! Our appreciations go also to ...|pg||

mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|henryb: I think if you play a "short club", Polish or Carrot or otherwise, there is an enormous advantage to playing transfer responses|pg||
nt|xenya: Hope you enjoyed the show.|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|nt|mmmakela: 5 clubs or 3 NT?|pg||

nt|othered1: due to the state of the match late in this event|pg||

nt|mariner1: E might be thinking of a dive here|pg||
nt|othered1: or even grand slam? (add @CA)|pg||
nt|henryb: sure.|pg||
nt|xenya: he can -- but 4@H is a practical/tactical bid|pg||
nt|othered1: I'll trade tactical advantage for the bonus for a cold slam|pg||
nt|xenya: Ns haven't been doing too well in this set -- so N felt some diversion was needed perhaps|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mariner1: well the slam is a lot smaller % than the much higher tactital advantage...... and if S|pg||
nt|mariner1: has that magic hand he might go anyway|pg||
mb|r|mb|p|mb|p|nt|xenya: there you are|pg||
nt|othered1: Looks like the 4@H bid was a stroke of genius, now see if the XX is worthwhile.|pg||
nt|panja: 5@D doubled down would be -500|pg||
mb|4N|nt|mariner1: we can see 5@D has better shot than 5@C|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hK|pc|h4|pc|h6|pc|h2|pg||
nt|othered1: I think the redouble might have been a bit greedy, trading 790 (or more) for 500|pg||
nt|mariner1: in @D S can be held to no @c and 1@D trick...... in @c S can score @c ruff too|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h7|pc|hA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|werge: West would probably have led a @s - so 4 @H would have been expensive|pg||

nt|mariner1: N would have been better off to take their plus in 4@H DBL|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|d2|pc|d8|pg||

pc|cA|pc|cT|pc|c3|pc|c9|pg||
