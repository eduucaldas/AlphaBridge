nt|vugraphzht: hi all!|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|bobholl: small @S lead more probable|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bobholl: small @S lead might beat it|pg||
nt|xenya: Your commentators are Bob Holl (the Netherlands) and Michael Barel (Israel). I am Vladimir Ivanov from Russia|pg||
nt|vugraphzht: 1 sec pls|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cQ|nt|xenya: and Martin Johnson (Canada) -- of course|pg||
nt|mich-b: Hi all|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c2|pg||
nt|mich-b: I like north's decision to pass rather than open 1@D or 3@D|pg||
nt|mich-b: both those choices have too many flaws , imo|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|pc|hK|pc|hT|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|pc|d2|pc|d7|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|Walddk3: Someone oce told me (I think it was 100 years ago) that when the bidding goes 1NT 3NT   or   1NT  2NT  ;  3NT   you should lead a major|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d6|pc|d8|pg||
pc|d4|pc|s5|pc|dA|nt|bobholl: weak two @D anyone ?|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
mc|12|nt|mich-b: yes...if I am playing that|pg||
nt|mich-b: (2@D weak)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: somebody also said lead your longest suit|pg||
pg||
qx|o10|st||md|4S53HKT953DAT3CK64,SAKQ84HA64D2CAJT2,SJ9762HQ7DJ986C85,STHJ82DKQ754CQ973|sv|b|nt|Walddk3: Mind you, no lead would beat it with spades 4-4|pg||
nt|bobholl: we have it within 2@C to prevent ennemy bidding |pg||
nt|vugraphzht: in this tourney no one pair plays 2@d weak opening|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1D!|nt|xenya: W knew both these rules it seems -- and that was his undoing|pg||
mb|1H|nt|mich-b: This hand is not easy for EW|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: do they play any of the roland prohibited conventions :)|pg||
nt|mich-b: they have values, controls, and @C fit.. so the temptation to search for 6@C is definetly there|pg||
mb|2H!|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|xenya: i predict 3N here|pg||
nt|mich-b: A natural auction may have started 1@S-1NT-3@C , and East would have to decide about supporting|pg||
nt|mich-b: I think they may very well get to 5@C|pg||
nt|bobholl: 1 @D denied how many points ?|pg||
nt|xenya: now, possibly|pg||
nt|fabsayc: has east shown any values, not clear|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|mich-b: if they are playing Polish Club , East woyuld respond 1@D with any 0-7 , and some better hands with minors|pg||
nt|xenya: one of the menings of the 1@D response is positive values with minors|pg||
nt|vugraphzht: yes, polish club|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hQ|nt|fabsayc: so east hand is well above minimum to that point in sequence|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hT|pc|hA|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|sT|pc|s5|pg||
nt|bobholl: won't loose to much in the butler but will loose|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|pc|h8|pc|s3|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like -1 to me|pg||
nt|xenya: she doesn't have 11 tricks due to 5-2 @Ss|pg||

pc|h5|mc|10|nt|bobholl: 1 down i believe but not the way it was shown|pg||
nt|xenya: most tables will be in 3N i think, so likely a huge gain for NS|pg||
nt|vugraphzht: yes sorry mistake somewhere|pg||
nt|vugraphzht: after 8 boards i will repeat this one|pg||

nt|vugraphzht: -1 result|pg||

mb|1D|mb|1H|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|xenya: after winnin the @SK, declarer could have ruffed a club, draw the last trump and play @Hs -- that would have led to -1 i think|pg||
nt|mowen: nice solid 1@H overcall|pg||
nt|bobholl: N doesn't know if he wants them to save|pg||
nt|xenya: all that double-dummy of course|pg||
nt|mowen: better still if he discarded a @S at trick 1|pg||
nt|mowen: 4@H is makeable|pg||
nt|fabsayc: north may regret not bidding 4@H directly|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: but in practise neither major game likely to make|pg||
nt|april7: N will continue bidding, but might not reach 4 @H, which he could suceed finding @C Q but he won't|pg||
mb|p|pc|sK|pc|s5|pc|s2|pc|h2|pg||
nt|xenya: but 3@H looks pretty safe?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mowen: with the @Ds blocked $@H makes by ducking a @C|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hT|pc|h9|pg||
nt|fabsayc: west will have a problem if declarer runs hearts also|pg||
nt|april7: if he finds out K of @D with E then hewill cash ace and K of @C droping the Q|pg||
nt|mowen: 4@H that is|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s3|pc|h5|pc|s7|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|pc|s8|pc|d2|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|pc|s9|pc|d3|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h8|nt|mowen: I am surprised west passed out 3@H - bidding 3@S looks normal to me|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|d4|pg||
nt|bobholl: will finesse @C now i think|pg||
nt|april7: should play @D first|pg||
nt|mowen: even 4@S is reasonable on better breaks|pg||
nt|april7: then he can't effort the finesse|pg||
nt|fabsayc: why play a diamond?|pg||
nt|bobholl: only 4 @D left :)|pg||
nt|xenya: difficult to tell how good +140 will be here|pg||
nt|mowen: thats true - they could be 2-2 now|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think he can conclude the diamonds are blocked|pg||
nt|april7: heshouldn't have shorten himself, but in 3 @H there is no danger|pg||
nt|bobholl: that will be good i think datum will be 0 or so|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so ducking a club is a real possibility|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dK|pc|d5|nt|mowen: we can work out the @Ds were 6-1 but why no @D lead?|pg||

pc|sT|pc|c6|pc|sA|pc|c3|pg||

nt|mowen: hi Martin|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|mowen: what have I missed?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: overtricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzht: cc says that 2@c = 5-11 hcp, 5+@h/5+ any other|pg||
nt|vugraphzht: and table explanation same|pg||
mb|p|nt|mich-b: NS could be it trouble here|pg||
mb|2D|mb|d|nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mich-b: they dont really have anywhere to go|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the old polish 2@D opener, except this version allows more room to sort out suits|pg||
pc|cT|nt|xenya: also EW are somewhat lucky in that they have nowhere to go either|pg||
nt|mich-b: Yes, with the "normal" 2@H opening , they may have ended in 3@D|pg||
nt|mowen: E/W have done well to catch them - now they have to defend well|pg||
nt|bobholl: big trouble NS no game on and 500 or so |pg||
nt|fabsayc: more likely 2@H doubled|pg||

nt|bobholl: K won't help|pg||
nt|mowen: natural to finesse|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not really a guess however|pg||
nt|xenya: it will i think -- for -1|pg||
nt|mowen: as it gains at least 1 trick if working|pg||
nt|fabsayc: east would not lead spade from queen|pg||
nt|mowen: did west ask for a spade?|pg||
nt|xenya: E rates to have the A on the auction, too?|pg||

nt|xenya: go also to Pavel Portnoy, who has been extremely active in organising the tournament throughout its existence, the sponsors and all those who have helped bring this event to the ...|pg||
nt|xenya: BBO audience. Thanks to my fellow commentators Martin, Bob, Michael, Steve, Mike and Avram...|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: The 3NT bid has an air of finality about it, which West might well have passed |pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: for donating their time and expertise to guide us through this set...|pg||
mb|3C|nt|mowen: should have in my book|pg||
nt|vugraphzht: thanks all!|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|xenya: and, of course, to all the spectators for their witty and helpful comments|pg||
nt|vugraphzht: well be back in 10-15 minutes for the 15 round!|pg||
nt|bobholl: and thanks vladimir too :)|pg||
nt|mowen: tough for north here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and south, 3@H or 3nt|pg||
nt|fabsayc: would want a little more beef for 3nt perhaps|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3NT is playing partner for a lot|pg||
nt|bobholl: a bit ligth for 3nt in my opinion|pg||
nt|mowen: 3NT looks a lot on a 6 count|pg||
nt|mowen: choice is 3 of a red|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mowen: wow|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so is pass|pg||
nt|bobholl: he is a law follower|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, well|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mowen: e/w could have 10 clubs|pg||
nt|fabsayc: you can't follow a law when you have no idea of the fit|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d2|pc|d7|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I'd be playing 3@H here on the 4-2 fit|pg||
nt|april7: N will get his ruff and W will be 3 down|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so a fortunate pass, all tricks cash, partner has great defense|pg||
nt|mowen: they need the @H ruff|pg||
nt|bobholl: true but more than 9 @C they won't have if you have a 44 @H you can use it|pg||

nt|xenya: revoked?|pg||
nt|xenya: fair enough|pg||

nt|mowen: great decision by south|pg||
nt|mowen: what would north have done after a 3@H response?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: good question|pg||
nt|fabsayc: they might have limped into 3nt anyway, but not clear|pg||
nt|mdgraham: thanks all, bye for now |pg||
nt|mowen: how? would north bid it with 2 small clubs?|pg||
nt|bobholl: the @H ruff destrois the law (18 tricks) but here only 6+9 = 15|pg||

nt|mdgraham: Regular partnerships should have an agreement about whether West's sequence here (2@H followedby 3@H) shows 5/5 |pg||
pc|h9|pc|h7|pc|h3|pc|hT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: which is where Smolen can be useful, as it gives some definition to transfer sequences like this|pg||
nt|fabsayc: smolen per se is not needed however, since the natural rebids have the same implication|pg||
nt|bobholl: after smolen 3nt 4@H shows a weaker 55 ?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: actually i think some would treat it as stronger 55|pg||
nt|bobholl: we do indeed :)|pg||
nt|mowen: west was a passed hand this time|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you could argue that West's sequence here shows 6@S 5@H |pg||
pc|s5|pc|sQ|pc|s4|pc|s2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but it's all, as ever, a matter of partnership agreement|pg||
