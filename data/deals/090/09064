nt|Walddk2: Slowest woman is 39th|pg||
nt|onebid: :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: G, this will take E-W 11 minutes to bid|pg||
nt|mariner1: EW have interesting slam here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Lots of relays|pg||
nt|onebid: very hard to bid these hands - what should West do after 1@H - 1@S?|pg||
nt|mariner1: 7@H makes|pg||
nt|onebid: nice club position for that|pg||
nt|mariner1: @S lead causes problems for @c slam|pg||
nt|jbgood: guess we are on the road soon - but no need to fasten your seatbelts:)|pg||

nt|mariner1: 7@H makes any lead|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Remember that 1@H was limited to 15 hcp. In that context I think 3@H is fair|pg||

nt|onebid: I still like an initial 3@S bid|pg||
nt|onebid: but Gabor is correct, 2@S not best|pg||
nt|jbgood: if S has an ordinary opener with 4 spades - 4 spades is likely to make. |pg||
nt|cicus: many play here 3@S is the same as 2@S  - only with 1 spade longer|pg||
mb|5D|nt|onebid: not I - more distribution, fewer high cards|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s7|pc|h3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, Bart's doubles usually promise support for all suits, the opponents' included :)|pg||

pc|c5|pc|c3|pc|cJ|nt|cicus: hard to see why decl should get it right|pg||
pc|c7|pg||

nt|onebid: Uncle John (bart's alter ego) just reported. He doubles|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good boy|pg||
nt|geot: may clubs must have been solved to have a slight chance to win ten tricks|pg||

pc|h4|pc|s8|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d2|nt|mariner1: if he ruffs 4th @S then he loses two @H|pg||
nt|geot: maybe|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|geot: specs says GIB says so, and GIB is often right:)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|cicus: only play to deny crossruff|pg||
nt|geot: It is normal to play S who has five spades for double club, so even if GIB is right it doesen't mean it is correct to solve the clubs in practical bridge|pg||
