mb|p|nt|stc: 1@d shows @Hs|pg||
nt|chmitty: you make on a @s expass if North leads @s ... because then you have the communications|pg||
nt|hedyg: needs to play @H twice from dummy|pg||
nt|chmitty: but after the 2@s bid, of course Thomas will finesse against North|pg||

pc|dT|nt|cicus: if W does not find the ruff|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|nt|stc: I mean a @s ruff|pg||
nt|thegarve: North had an invite at best with scattered values and some random jacks|pg||
nt|athene: east is following the normal strategy of defending a 4-4 fit with Axxx trumps|pg||
nt|athene: you force one hand to ruff, then hold up the trump ace|pg||
nt|athene: until the third round|pg||
nt|athene: then you can continue the force and get trump control|pg||
nt|cicus: still problem if E ducks a round of hearts|pg||
nt|athene: yes, down now|pg||
nt|cicus: which he will|pg||
nt|athene: down simply on a spade ruff|pg||

nt|chmitty: @h from hand now|pg||
nt|chmitty: as he has two discards for his @d|pg||
nt|chmitty: @c to dummy has more rosk but makes 11 tricks|pg||
nt|chmitty: risk|pg||
nt|hedyg: @H from hand loses 2@hs|pg||
nt|chmitty: yes Hedy but in case North was @c singleton ?|pg||
nt|hedyg: quite possible..|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hT|nt|athene: but even without that, it still goes down as he loses trump control|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dK|pc|d8|nt|athene: and when you lose trump control, you go a LOT down|pg||
nt|cicus: now even -2|pg||
nt|athene: a good example of how it's better to force declarer rather than just go for ruffs|pg||
nt|cicus: -3, even|pg||
nt|athene: 3 down if east just runs clubs|pg||

pc|c7|nt|cicus: in fact I can't see why 2NT should be better on this hand|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|nt|cicus: there is no guaranteethat the hand plays better from the N side and you may get too high and you may lose spades...|pg||
nt|athene: Multon really wants the defence to play the black suits|pg||

mb|p|nt|fabsayc: no crystal ball :)|pg||
nt|thegarve: q@s lead?|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes|pg||
nt|chmitty: but there are other factors|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: lots of hcp here, but not too many tricks|pg||
nt|thegarve: quick unblock|pg||
pc|s3|nt|cicus: 1@S looks like a forcing 1NT|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sA|pg||
nt|chmitty: you rarely know exactly if it is 50 % |pg||
pc|sJ|nt|thegarve: what is 3NT a forcing 3NT?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|cicus: now they may bid slam by accident|pg||
nt|hedyg: for Roland of course 12.89%........|pg||
pc|s4|pc|h4|pg||
nt|athene: well everything is right for 6@C|pg||
nt|cicus: W thinking E is stronger|pg||
nt|athene: west can't have a better hand for clubs, can he? given his partner has shown short diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt showed a diamond stop and his partner still went on, so his actual weak diamonds are really great|pg||
nt|thegarve: West has a huge hand on the auction with no @d wastage|pg||
nt|cicus: I can't see East thinking now|pg||
pc|s9|nt|vugraphzdq: sorry south is thinking|pg||
nt|thegarve: overe 2@C 2@S is a good raise in natural methods and he chose not to do that|pg||
nt|athene: south is thinking about his lead before he passes?|pg||
nt|cicus: ah did he consider doubling?|pg||
nt|athene: well he might double if he wants to defend 20@C|pg||
nt|hedyg: great lead|pg||
nt|athene: he probably expected to find the @SK in dummy most of the time (east has the strong hand) |pg||
nt|thegarve: it was q@S by default - he knows the opps have the minors|pg||
nt|hedyg: hard to show smith echo with a singleton|pg||
nt|brgpro: gave away an under trick?|pg||
pc|s8|nt|chmitty: ans sometimes opponents have a misunderstanding|pg||
pc|sK|nt|fabsayc: fishing for clues as to clubs|pg||

nt|hedyg: why Jack? cant E have 4 4 majors?|pg||
nt|brgpro: double dummy i mean|pg||
nt|hedyg: sry why Martin?|pg||
nt|thegarve: if he plays a @S now they may get blocked|pg||
nt|thegarve: q@S has huge upsides other leads can give the contract|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok, but E still can have majors, only knows W doesnt|pg||

nt|hedyg: 2@H was relay i think|pg||
mb|4S|nt|cicus: no from N :)|pg||

mb|d|nt|hedyg: 1@s= 14+ |pg||
nt|stc: Slam time, a good 6@c -1|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|hedyg: 12 imps back|pg||
nt|athene: Fantoni-Nunes have earned thousands of imps over the years bidding and making 6minor when other room are in 3nt|pg||
nt|hedyg: true|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@S= 0-9 no M|pg||
nt|vugraphzdq: no Hedy|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: and west's pass is very strange|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: am i correct, they do not open 1nt with 54 or 45 majors?|pg||
nt|hedyg: opps might have talked them out of it|pg||
nt|hedyg: never|pg||
nt|chmitty: at least 5@c 6-9|pg||
mb|2H|nt|hedyg: and anyhow 1NT is 12-14|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: so that was a clue on previous set in 5@C contract|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes|pg||
nt|hedyg: though not sure the @H distribution was clear|pg||
nt|hedyg: and they do open 1NT with 4 4 4 1|pg||
nt|henryb: And I prefer a raise to 3@c by West|pg||
nt|thegarve: E/W have been cautious so far|pg||
nt|hedyg: nothing in the CC re bid after X of 1NT|pg||
nt|chmitty: interesting 2@h bid|pg||
mb|2S|mb|d|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|chmitty: natural I suppose with 3 cards (four was denied)|pg||
nt|chmitty: a try to play in 4@h which is quite close indeed|pg||
nt|hedyg: are we sure of that?|pg||
nt|chmitty: what else ?|pg||
nt|hedyg: i mean re no 4@hs|pg||
nt|chmitty: North is willing to play 4@h opposite x Axx xxxx Axxxx or 3NT opposite xx Axx xxx Axxxx|pg||
nt|hedyg: Fantoni is minimum of his bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|chmitty: he will pass|pg||
nt|chmitty: yes|pg||
pc|c2|nt|stc: @s lead in OR|pg||
nt|fabsayc: open room result restores interest in this match|pg||
nt|athene: well N-S beat par handily here :)|pg||
nt|cicus: N misplayed 6@H in CR to lose 11 IMPs|pg||
nt|athene: to be fair the 5@C does depend on finesses in both majors|pg||
nt|hedyg: and did|pg||
nt|hedyg: nice contract|pg||
nt|chmitty: now he sees that 4@h would depend on a 33 @h break|pg||
pc|c7|nt|athene: well the play in 6@H wasn't trivial|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cK|pg||
nt|hedyg: hard to guess the @c void in N|pg||
nt|thegarve: a sarange auction|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|stc: Blumental "only" two swings behind|pg||
pc|c6|nt|athene: E-W can count themselves fortunate there's no diamond ruff for 800 :)|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cT|pg||
nt|jallerton: K8xx is not good enough for a 4-3 fit|pg||
pc|c4|nt|thegarve: Wast has a defence hand but jumps to game, South only raised to 2S with AQxx|pg||
nt|jallerton: but it was a nice 2@h bid by South nonetheless|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes Jeffrey that is exactly what i meant when i said if his @hs were better|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's been a while since we have had 2700 spectators at one table, but these two pairs are top class|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|chmitty: I thought you would say that commentators are top class :(|pg||

nt|hedyg: 1 imp back|pg||
nt|chmitty: possible swing here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The contract in the closed room on 10 is 5@SX|pg||
nt|hedyg: 7 boards and 8 imps|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|athene: if west just raises spades it might be hard to diagnose all the wastage in clubs in time|pg||
mb|1D|nt|athene: east might just bash a slam|pg||
nt|chmitty: -500 though|pg||
nt|hedyg: Laure bd 11 pas +1?|pg||
nt|jallerton: May let through 4@s on the lead here so EW need to find 5@d|pg||
nt|Walddk2: NS "saved" over 5@D, but it's difficult for North not to bid one more|pg||
nt|vugraphzdq: I'm looking on the match paper|pg||
nt|hedyg: he surely made 10 tricks|pg||
mb|4S|nt|thegarve: @d as a xfer and then show @d or 2@C as an xfer and then show @h|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: ok ty|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: N to the rescue|pg||
nt|athene: after 3@H he will surely bid slam|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@C cue, bad news for W|pg||
nt|thegarve: 2@S again is too heavy with a great side suit|pg||
nt|brgpro: prefer 4@h rather than 4@c|pg||
nt|hedyg: cue up the line|pg||
nt|brgpro: he might think pd has 3 small @c and asking for help|pg||
nt|athene: 4@C is ok if it's definitely shortage, but if you might bid it with a void OR @CKQJxx it's a bit silly in my opinion|pg||
nt|hedyg: i like 4@c leaving space for pd to bid 4@d|pg||
mb|d|nt|thegarve: ahh another variant|pg||
nt|athene: 2@D is presumably just game-forcing with diamonds|pg||
nt|chmitty: x is not 100 % for penalty here ... East might consider his cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|brgpro: as i said b4, in this kind situations, 4 of a new suit is better used as help suit slam try|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@H will not get a @d cue|pg||
nt|athene: 5@D is east's not north's we assume|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|chmitty: 4SA : choose your minor|pg||
nt|hedyg: in 5@D N is endplayed after A@s lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Excellent decision by Michel|pg||
nt|hedyg: same in 5@C after @s lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But, they need Fantoni to bid one more. Will he?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Eisenberg did in the other room|pg||
nt|jallerton: East has 4-card diamond support.  Why not 5@d?  Planning to correct 5@c to 5@d to show a stronger hand?|pg||
nt|hedyg: they seem to play your system Roland, doubes are for takeout up to 7@s?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Penalty doubles do not exist nowadays|pg||
mb|5C|nt|athene: hard lead problem for Mari|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Unless the opponents have a misunderstanding|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|chmitty: we can see Kx @c by North but West does not|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Like the Norwegian player who was doubled in 5@S and went for 1700|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: something to be said for either black suit|pg||
nt|athene: a heart is less appealing as partner didn't overcall 1@H|pg||
nt|chmitty: what if South plays 9 or 10 @c when the suit is played|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|nt|brgpro: pd has a lomited raise, the location of his points are much more important than his controls|pg||
nt|thegarve: after only bidding 2@s ends up making a grand slam try|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|brgpro: limited|pg||
nt|jallerton: mandatory falsecard|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That would be a nice falsecard|pg||
nt|hedyg: @H lead would have worked here|pg||
nt|chmitty: what if Fantoni plays a second @s|pg||
nt|jallerton: but unlikely to fool declarer on this bidding|pg||
nt|chmitty: you can't ruff from dummy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That is correct, ruff and discard will kill it|pg||
nt|chmitty: and if you ruff in hand how do you cross to dummy ?|pg||
nt|chmitty: 10 USD he will ?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am not betting against|pg||

nt|vugraphzdq: Pierre you like bet ? |pg||

mb|p|nt|henryb: +200 looks likw a pretty good result as 4@h does not make|pg||
nt|hedyg: i know people would bid 1@d|pg||
mb|4C|nt|athene: declarer won't be happy on a top club lead|pg||
nt|athene: but he will be more happy when north can't find a third card in the suit|pg||
nt|cicus: yes, E has the required 2 entries as @D9 can be used for that if opps switch to @DS|pg||
nt|athene: more likely it will be @H switch|pg||
nt|athene: south might well find some cunning way to ask for that|pg||
nt|hedyg: btw he could have bid it on his 2nd turn|pg||
nt|athene: you may KNOW them Hedy but i bet you don't PLAY with them|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol no|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: hmmm he didnt|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he had 4@S available also|pg||
nt|hedyg: specs suggesting X for 1100|pg||
nt|thegarve: 1@d is a normal overcall for some of us Bill|pg||
nt|henryb: A "laydown slam" for E-W and seven losers for N-S|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|athene: and declarer will happily get his extra entry and his club pitch|pg||
nt|cicus: then it provides the necessary entry for the double finesse|pg||
mb|4H|nt|fabsayc: spectators want to punish 4@H|pg||
nt|jallerton: a slam on thin values|pg||
nt|henryb: the key is no wastage in @s|pg||

nt|henryb: I would prefer 3@c by West to 2N|pg||
pc|sT|nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|chmitty: but an opportunity lost|pg||
nt|jallerton: spec asks about 2NT.  It is probably mandatory for this pair with 12-14 bal|pg||
nt|chmitty: 2N is mandatory in their system 3@c would show at least 54 or 4441|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|nt|athene: true a canapé 1@D opener showing a 5-card major would muddy the waters and find a nice fit|pg||
nt|hedyg: NS could have made a lot of @ds|pg||
nt|athene: 1@D overcall|pg||
nt|hedyg: i surely would have bid 2@d on my 2nd chance|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|athene: yes, 11 tricks looks normal now|pg||
nt|athene: eisenberg is considering various safety plays like leading to the @SA|pg||

pc|sA|nt|jallerton: I thought 4@h was a cue bid (forcing).  East disagreed!|pg||
nt|hedyg: 6@C bid in CR|pg||
nt|henryb: He will pitch a winner|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Michel will likely pitch here|pg||

nt|athene: the @DA isn't all that convenient as an entry for a second finesse because you lose the option of picking up some 4-1 diamond breaks|pg||
nt|cicus: this was a good line|pg||
nt|athene: hence finessing the @SQ rather than the @S10|pg||
nt|athene: a boring 4@S+1 here|pg||
nt|athene: Mouiel-Levy don't seem to have too much luck with their mini-NT - every time they have one they are vulnerable|pg||
nt|henryb: Why is Zimmerman behind. I thought they were ahead after the last set.|pg||
nt|vugraphzdq: For Michel 4@c is a fit @h|pg||
nt|jallerton: yes, scope for a swing on this deal|pg||

nt|chmitty: definitely|pg||
nt|henryb: It would not occur to me to open a vulnerable 3@s|pg||
nt|jallerton: yes, will never find the side @h fit|pg||
mb|4C|an|cue|nt|thegarve: North was most unlikley to be 1,2 in the blacks|pg||
mb|d|nt|jallerton: 4@c described as "cue"|pg||
nt|hedyg: well.......watch them|pg||
nt|chmitty: a false cue ... not at all to be in slam, but to prevent @c lead|pg||
nt|chmitty: against 4@s|pg||
nt|hedyg: he just wants a @D cue now|pg||
mb|p|an| |mb|p|nt|athene: many would overcall 1@S with east hand|pg||
nt|henryb: looks more like an ask: Do you have a club control?|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|athene: perhaps the italians will overcall 2@C showing 5-4 majors|pg||
nt|hedyg: i bet Fantoni will|pg||
mb|5D|nt|athene: well, there was a 2@C overcall last set which led to Fantunes stealing the board in 4@H-3|pg||
nt|athene: with vul 5@D on for opps|pg||
nt|athene: they all play 2@C is 5-4 majors and 2@D is 5-5 majors in this position|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 2@c= gf with @c or balanced or fit|pg||
mb|6S|nt|athene: a Drury auction and a dreary board here - time to get coffee and toast|pg||
nt|cicus: 3@S is probably showing 4, althouh the shape is rather flat|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: passed hand, must be fit?!|pg||
nt|athene: south now knows north has 4-1-3-5 shape with a small singleton heart|pg||
nt|athene: after 1@C, 1@S and 3@D|pg||
nt|hedyg: no Walsh NS..|pg||
nt|thegarve: balanced hands should rebid 1nt|pg||
nt|athene: the fact that he has nothing remotely like that is perhaps unfortunate|pg||
nt|thegarve: the style is akin to a 16-18 NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|hedyg: or just no Walsh Mouiel?|pg||
nt|hedyg: voila|pg||
nt|chmitty: impressive|pg||
nt|henryb: well done|pg||
nt|jallerton: I wonder what pass showed. 2nd round @c control?|pg||
nt|henryb: probably: XX = first, bid right away with none|pg||
nt|jallerton: The commentators were all agreed. "no chance of bidding 6@s"|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe it's better to play asking bids over a 3@S pre-empt, or 3@H for that matter|pg||
nt|chmitty: we must admit that when you hear your partner open 3@s first seat vulnerable, he may have something more than 7 cards to the jack|pg||
pc|c8|nt|hedyg: drury maybe?|pg||
nt|henryb: why do they jump to 3@s? 2@s would seem adequate after bidding 2@c|pg||
nt|athene: some specs are wondering if 11:45 is a normal time for breakfast in england|pg||
nt|athene: that depends what time you got to bed last night|pg||
nt|cicus: but of course could be worse (e.g. 3-3-3-3)|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps 3@S shows the fourth spade|pg||
pc|c4|nt|athene: what?|pg||
nt|hedyg: oh my|pg||
nt|brgpro: N has bid 3 suits and he has 3 "singletons" in the 4th|pg||
nt|athene: did that really happen?|pg||

pc|cJ|pc|cT|pg||
nt|hedyg: Laure is this a joke?|pg||
nt|thegarve: he has 4 suits by now a 4444 distribution|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|brgpro: after looking at that 6@s hand, i believe 4@d was the best call from E. for 1, u can ask if pd has help, for 2, u can also get a possible 4@h from pd, u really need that...|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: but south could have jumped in with the @C10 there and played a diamond|pg||
nt|athene: not easy to find :)|pg||
nt|henryb: better finesse the 7. otherwise the fourth club will squeeze declarer|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|athene: he will have to throw a winning major-suit card and then the defence put him in hand and wait for their two diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: strange hand, EW close to 4@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|chmitty: we can see the @d lead would have defeated 4@s|pg||

nt|athene: oh sorry the 1100 scores against zimmerman of course; yes you are right, it's going to be a close finish|pg||
nt|vugraphzdq: Last Board thank you everybody,I hope you enjoyed  lot during this afternoon|pg||
nt|hedyg: you were great Laure @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: special thanks to our specs for joining, we hope you enjoy the show|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: weird number of boards|pg||
nt|thegarve: try for 4-2 @d first and if that does not occur go back to @s and take a @s finesse|pg||
nt|hedyg: Laure when is the last segment?|pg||
nt|brgpro: @d was much easier to establish...7 cards rather than esttablishing the 6...|pg||
nt|thegarve: 2@c does not hurt much|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D now from south perhaps|pg||
nt|athene: although that's a bit wet - he might do more|pg||
nt|hedyg: i think 2@c shows longer @ds and 2@s would show longer @Hs|pg||
nt|thegarve: try 4@d|pg||
nt|thegarve: 2@c just makes it easier for oppo|pg||
nt|jallerton: and many thanks to Hedy too!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: although she was away with the birds occasionally|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Laure that is|pg||

nt|vugraphzdq: Thank you Hedy :)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|hedyg: 1 bd was badly duplicated earlier on|pg||
nt|fabsayc: aha|pg||
nt|brgpro: yes,|pg||
nt|hedyg: Levy has not forgotten that Mouiel is a passed hand|pg||
nt|brgpro: but more trumps entries in hand|pg||
pc|s2|nt|thegarve: prefer 4@D a good 4M overcall|pg||
nt|athene: fortunately for declarer dummy only has one trump and no entry so he can't play restricted choice in spades :)|pg||
nt|cicus: not many play that I think - but what else 4@D could be?|pg||
nt|athene: small club now perhaps|pg||
nt|henryb: but a low club might beat his|pg||
nt|athene: 2@S - 4@S wld have bought it i think|pg||
nt|hedyg: the double by Mari is ambiguous here...is it 3 cards in @S or good @cs?|pg||
nt|athene: maybe west is a bit weak for 2@S vul against not|pg||
nt|athene: double should be 3-card spade fit for sure|pg||
nt|brgpro: even if @s 3-3 and @h 3-1, u might not manage because the trumps are blocked in hand?|pg||
nt|hedyg: they might not play 2@s as weak|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|jallerton: 3NT not too far away NS here|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|Walddk2: Board 15 scored now|pg||
nt|henryb: only two tricks, but may make 3@d|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|pc|h3|pg||
pc|h7|nt|athene: i meant a 2@S opener :) clearly having passed you can respond 2@S|pg||
nt|brgpro: there was no @h10 in dummy...|pg||
nt|thegarve: 5@s would be offon a marked @H lead|pg||
pc|h6|nt|fabsayc: the fat lady seems to have a sore throat|pg||
nt|hedyg: @c lead kills dummy|pg||
nt|hedyg: last 2 bds and 6 imps|pg||
nt|fabsayc: club is only lead to give problems|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and it does seem diagnosable|pg||
nt|hedyg: well he wont lead a red suit IMO|pg||
nt|hedyg: @s is a possibility|pg||
nt|fabsayc: there are not 9 tricks anyway|pg||
pc|hA|nt|hedyg: voila!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: covering my ass with last comment :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|fabsayc: spectators think 4@S is cold, seems they are right|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|henryb: defense has 2@s, 3@h and a @d against 3N|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cQ|nt|hedyg: but 2@s is 5+..|pg||
nt|athene: no danger now|pg||

nt|vugraphzdq: Thank you :) see you in 20 minutes|pg||
nt|thegarve: it'll be hard to real in a 42 IMp deficit |pg||
nt|henryb: 4@d could be a @d preempt, specially against people who sometimes open on 3 card (or shorter) @d|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|chmitty: optimum result here for the campionnissssssimi|pg||
