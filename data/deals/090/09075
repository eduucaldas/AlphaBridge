nt|mariner1: Marita Roberg is our super operator, Hi Marita!|pg||
nt|vugraphzdu: hi :)|pg||
nt|cindy: and E opened in 3rd seat|pg||
nt|cindy: it could be your hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzdu: http://www.bk2000.org/live/|pg||
nt|daman: 3@C was a feeble bid in fron of an unpassed partner|pg||
nt|daman: took him out of the equation|pg||
nt|chick: must be a goulash dealer they have over there :)|pg||
nt|granguru: Here everyone has his own suit...some better than others|pg||

mb|2H|nt|mdgraham: anyone for 1@S in third? |pg||
nt|mcarroll: and as usual @S wins|pg||
nt|chick: how many for 4@S?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|granguru: I for 5@S|pg||

mb|4H|nt|mariner1: not me at imps|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx!|pg||
nt|vugraphzdu: :)|pg||
nt|april7: 3NT |pg||
nt|april7: 3@H |pg||
nt|mcphee: that is quite the 2@H raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: obeying the law|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: if its our hand, partner will bid again over 1@S|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|mcphee: lots would treat the S hand as a limit raise|pg||
nt|josj: they nicely avoided game here|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: thats true also|pg||
nt|cindy: but i would rather get my bid in at a low level|pg||
nt|cindy: rather than guessing at a higher level|pg||
nt|daman: quite the auction in the other room|pg||
nt|mcarroll: David mentioned that this pair are imaginative bidders - this seems like a good example|pg||
nt|granguru: Looks like no one will be in 6@S as in the OR|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: if I had A or KQs maybe|pg||
nt|josj: as they did in OR, yes|pg||
nt|chick: I don't understand the 3N bid, can't imagine wanting to play in 3N with an exposed Kx and a solid 8 card suit|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|yo_yo: can East cuebid @S?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|april7: thats a good idea because 3NT might go down on @C lead|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that link is for 2008 operator|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mdgraham: I'm not such a good cardholder as you, Rob - I have to make do with queens and jacks|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://nbfdata.bridge.no/Turnering/default.asp?Fil=2009div1   for standing after round 5|pg||
nt|sybarra: www.bk2000.org/live/teams.aspx  for running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|april7: N loses only 1 @S and 2 @C, but careful now|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The competition started in November, Kath|pg||
nt|april7: should play Q|pg||
nt|Walddk4: This is the second weekend of 2|pg||
nt|yo_yo: got it now ty|pg||
nt|sybarra: we did the Nov. beginning |pg||
nt|sybarra: rounds|pg||
nt|yo_yo: my norwegian is not so good|pg||
nt|sybarra: mine is non-existent |pg||
nt|yo_yo: luckily most norwegians speak english|pg||
nt|april7: N has to rely on ace of @C with E and >K of @H also with E|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Flatt doesnt know it but everything sitting well for him|pg||
nt|mcphee: once S bids a simple 2@H game was well out of the photo|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|sA|nt|frankaus: 5@H usually a trump quality ask - - bid 6 with good trumps|pg||
pc|s4|nt|josj: well, 4@H certainly has play but not today|pg||
nt|april7: early @C promotion for @S discard necessary|pg||
pc|s5|nt|yo_yo: East made it easier in the OR by jumping to 3@H|pg||
nt|yo_yo: even so  7 is a tremendous bid|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Helge is hoping nothing splits|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|mariner1: well if I open a lead director I usually really want the lead.......|pg||
pc|sK|nt|yo_yo: hoping the @C finesse is wrong|pg||
pc|c8|pc|s7|nt|mdgraham: time for clubs now |pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|granguru: After opponents @H overcall is very easy to get a @H lead..Specially if you are very short on the suit..|pg||
pc|c9|nt|chick: whoever bid 7 must have been hoping EVERYTHING split :)|pg||
nt|april7: should have played @C before, now no entry to hand|pg||
nt|mcphee: yes, prior to cashing the K@H|pg||
nt|josj: still tired from previous board|pg||
nt|mcphee: :)|pg||

pc|h3|pg||
pc|s9|pc|d2|pc|d4|pc|h4|pg||
pc|s8|pc|hT|nt|april7: since W gets the trump trick, N discards a @C loser on @D Q|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Maybe we should give our foreigners some    å å å å å å å å å|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and  ø ø ø ø ø ø ø|pg||
nt|granguru: And ocasionally you may not have 4@S|pg||
pc|d5|pc|h6|pg||
nt|mcphee: Tondel had a clear 3@H raise as you point out|pg||
pc|s6|pc|h9|nt|yo_yo: dont tell me you speak Norwegian too Roland|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Norwegian is merely Danish with a horrible accent|pg||

nt|cicus: hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our operator is Marita|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: maybe playing a club at trick 2 was better |pg||
nt|mariner1: anyone know if there is a results or updates link? I don't speak Norwegian.........|pg||
nt|mcphee: Lindqvist  will be very pleased to see he has no lost imps that last hand|pg||
mb|2H|nt|yo_yo: now is that a 12-14  NT or a 15-17?|pg||
nt|chick: 14-16? :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 13-15|pg||
nt|Walddk4: They play Precision|pg||
nt|yo_yo: we got there :)|pg||
nt|ady: 2@H   about the limit   but n/s  can make 3@S|pg||
mb|2S|nt|yo_yo: i see the a in Flatt has one of those symbols|pg||
mb|3D|nt|mariner1: 4@H sure seems like it has play here|pg||
nt|cicus: surely the bidding went otherwise, still the contract is ok|pg||
nt|geot: Hi all:)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: good morning Gabor and Geo|pg||
nt|Walddk4: yes, operator catching up|pg||
nt|vugraphzdu: sorry. we had a bit of problem here. ok now i think :)|pg||
nt|cicus: hello Marita, Geo, Ronald, Ralf|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You can take 7@C to your bank managers and get a big loan|pg||
nt|josj: well, he lost his gain, didn't he?|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ady: south may bid too high|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: roland hears everything!|pg||
nt|frankaus: XX will some rescue mechanism|pg||
nt|cicus: as can be seen, a laydown 6@C has been missed|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and  Høyland|pg||
nt|mcphee: quiqte true|pg||
nt|lestergold: well this looks like another reasonable major suit game which is unlikely to make as cards lie|pg||
nt|daman: will South take the plunge to 4@S? red?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|josj: according to the principle that, in general, bridge matches are lost rather than won|pg||
nt|lestergold: mind u not a compulsory 4s- if they bid conservatively opportunity for a gain|pg||
nt|lestergold: but they havent|pg||
nt|april7: its a vulnerable game so its ok|pg||
nt|lestergold: south knows his k of cl;ubs isno l;ooking like a good card but north sees a singleton club and likes his hand|pg||
nt|mcphee: perfectly normal 4@S|pg||
nt|josj: nice gadget to make S declarer|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: yes|pg||
nt|april7: S might not have a perfest opener|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: guess its tough to handle trumps and @c with only one entry in dummy|pg||
nt|mdgraham: practical 4@H bid|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://nbfdata.bridge.no/Turnering/default.asp?Fil=2009div1    results (I think)|pg||
nt|april7: 12 tricks in NT but 13 in @C|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 13 in NT too|pg||
nt|Walddk4: South is squeezed in spades and diamonds|pg||
nt|april7: @D finesse :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: No finesse|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: At least they escaped the double|pg||
pc|c6|nt|april7: I see only 12|pg||
nt|mcphee: a lot rests on what he plays now|pg||
nt|april7: but the 10,s make up for 4,3,3,3 and only 12 points|pg||
nt|lestergold: on a good day u lose a spade club and a dim but no today to coin a phrase|pg||
nt|granguru: N needs only the @SA in dummy fo make 4@s. U nfortunatelly dummy is worthless|pg||
pc|c8|nt|granguru: The favourable lead is not enough...|pg||
pc|c3|nt|Walddk4: The squeeze is automatic, Avram|pg||
nt|ady: try to sneak a diamond through|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes - if NS reversed their @H holding this lead would be very costly|pg||
nt|granguru: Declarer will probably play small @D to the @DQ now|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|josj: lucky escape for W|pg||
nt|lestergold: a small dim would have been an inspired play|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d6|nt|april7: @S/@D?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: yes|pg||
nt|ady: east will then be forced to try A@H|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mdgraham: that might help - has the option of the spade finesse after discovering a trump losere|pg||
nt|chick: best bet is to play for 2-2 hearts and use the @S entry for finessing clubs|pg||
nt|yo_yo: roald might have regretted that bid had someone doubled|pg||
nt|frankaus: i dont think i want to be at the 3 level with Wests heap of ..........|pg||
nt|yo_yo: me neither|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i would be quaking at the 2 level|pg||
nt|chick: or 1NX|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|april7: might try to give a @D ruff then there is a chance|pg||
nt|mcphee: he lead a low @D, there is not going to be any ruffs there|pg||
nt|lestergold: surely wil;l play club thru the dim can wait|pg||
nt|april7: 2 smaller 1d MISSING|pg||
pc|hA|nt|frankaus: maybe a catch up for  missing the slam|pg||
pc|h2|nt|april7: but its nicer to be in 7@C,don't you think so?|pg||
pc|h7|nt|mdgraham: you need two entries for that - jack, queen, king ace....need to get back to dummy to hook @C8 |pg||
nt|Walddk4: This is the most simple squeeze there is because it materialies automatically|pg||
nt|Walddk4: materialises  even|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|sybarra: and with that lead in NT it would even be easier, just count to 13|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|lestergold: now declarer has to guess ht to avoi 2 off|pg||
nt|mcphee: now S is annoyed about the @D suit|pg||
nt|april7: 6 of @D lead was perfect, that betterr than top of nothing, 3/5 lead|pg||
nt|mcphee: I think he has things summed up and is steamed|pg||
nt|lestergold: but 6d lead was possibly the only lead to give contract ironically if north had played low reading it as not from an honour|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h8|nt|mdgraham: which, as it happens, does not work|pg||
nt|yo_yo: he just needs to check the @C are splitting|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h9|pc|hK|pc|s2|pg||
nt|yo_yo: so now a @H ruff?|pg||
pc|c9|nt|mdgraham: however declarer has guessed hearts correctly|pg||
pc|c2|pc|s8|pc|c4|pg||
nt|mcphee: i would also have played Q|pg||
pc|dK|nt|lestergold: an unneceesary contribution to the defence coffers|pg||
pc|d7|nt|yo_yo: and bobs your uncle|pg||

mb|p|nt|mariner1: so the 2@H shown was just the final contract... not the auction|pg||

mb|p|nt|mariner1: S should realize H has 5 spades here and does|pg||

nt|cindy: its too good for 1N|pg||
nt|cindy: and 1N may be conventional for them|pg||
nt|yo_yo: not good enough, you see what happened in OR|pg||

nt|april7: N bid 1 @S on 4 cards and S raised to game|pg||
nt|lestergold: well the dim opener worked well on this occasion|pg||
nt|mcphee: not the worst of openings at these colors|pg||
nt|josj: yes, it quickly located the double fit|pg||
nt|april7: @D opener on 9 points?|pg||
nt|mcphee: for any pair using a strong @C system opening 1@D kinda routine|pg||

nt|lestergold: he has an ace and a king for defence and has 4 spades and a nice 6 card suit sometimes i think we pay tyoo much attentionm to point counts|pg||

pc|c2|pg||
pc|c6|pc|s4|nt|mcarroll: All roads seem to lead to 10 tricks|pg||

pc|c3|pg||

nt|mdgraham: probably 1@H-1@s-splinter? |pg||
nt|cicus: 6@D seems best here|pg||
nt|april7: thats 4@S making 5 or 6|pg||
nt|mcphee: will have to have someone do a ZAR count for that hand|pg||
nt|daman: now 4@S for NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: that was how Open bid it|pg||
nt|cindy: well   there it may be true|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a nice 6@d? |pg||
nt|geot: Nice slam here, 6@D is almost lay down if diamonds are 3-2. Not reached in the OR|pg||
mb|1C|nt|cindy: but here you have meckwell stealing from you all the time|pg||
nt|daman: pretty straightforwars even with the bad trump break|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1H|nt|mdgraham: it can be useful to have the agreement that, when you splinter as opener, your first suit is really good |pg||
nt|cicus: although 6NT is on but...|pg||
nt|april7: has to guess @S 10 for 12 tricks|pg||
nt|mcphee: ZAR points is a way of counting the values of your hand a little differently|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: so in spite of missing a grand slam  Vest agder go into the lead|pg||
nt|cindy: teaches you real fast not to be a coward|pg||
nt|april7: an "easy" 3NT by N|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes looks pretty standard|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mariner1: very true Mike.........|pg||
nt|geot: 1NT is forcing, may be start of relays, which it is this time|pg||
nt|josj: nice 3nt here|pg||
nt|lestergold: now here we have an example of exactly the kind of yucky 12 count i am talking about|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: 1NT is FG relay|pg||
nt|mcphee: the last hand was about 27 zar points, which qualifies as an opening bid|pg||
mb|2D|an|()|nt|yo_yo: are these names regions of Norway, looks like it|pg||
nt|april7: now there is  a problem|pg||
nt|april7: lucky for E that ace of @D with S|pg||
nt|sybarra: thinking the same |pg||
nt|ady: looks like a routine 4@S 10 or 11 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Grøtheim asking, Tundal showing|pg||
nt|mcphee: you can read about zar points online at his web site|pg||
mb|3H|nt|frankaus: we bid on flea tickets here  but not with 4333's|pg||
nt|ralfwil: what should 2@c from N mean?|pg||
nt|geot: Now relays. We can count on that N will show his distribution etc etc..and then I think Grøtheim will find out enough to bid 6@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: we say "tram" tickets|pg||
nt|cindy: well  here everyone bids aggressively so you have field protection|pg||
nt|cicus: no details in sysrtem card|pg||
nt|geot: I am not sure about 2@C, but I think a max hand|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I have an expert in the audience|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 2@H  min  not 6 hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 2@S relay|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 3@D  side suit in clubs|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I cannt understand the sys of NS, says a spectator. I don't blame him|pg||
nt|cicus: I would bid 3@H now :)|pg||
nt|geot: he he|pg||
nt|geot: I guess S will bid 3@H too, to find out the distribution in S+D|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The system allows them to pinpoint jacks if they like, aparat from shape, hcp concentration and controls|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Very sophusticated system|pg||
nt|Walddk4: We would all bid 7NT of course|pg||
nt|geot: Sorry specs, we cant explain good enough this bidding. It is more than 25 years since I played Precision, then with Grøtheim, when he started developing is good system|pg||
nt|geot: his good system.|pg||
nt|mcphee: give it a google|pg||
nt|april7: how come N passed 2@C?|pg||
nt|april7: X!!!|pg||
nt|josj: now S can X|pg||
nt|mcphee: what would you have bid?|pg||
nt|lestergold: unless they have a system in which reopening double does not promise extras, i would not be too impressed|pg||
mb|4S|nt|mcarroll: yes - but @d do not run so has to rely on @S finesse|pg||
nt|april7: good judgement, E has no entries to the @S suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: hmm|pg||
nt|lestergold: and its only hundreds in this horrible contract with a nasty lie of the cards as well|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: so easy bidding in both rooms|pg||
nt|geot: looks  natural lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: yes - a most honourable push|pg||
nt|yo_yo: opening bid + opening bid = game  thinks Ericksen|pg||
nt|vugraphzdu: test|pg||
pc|dA|nt|chick: and what's more, with the weakness in the unbid suit, inviting the lead|pg||
nt|mcarroll: They were a little more ambitious in Open - in 5@S|pg||
nt|april7: solves all problems|pg||
nt|lestergold: must lose 7 top tricks for a modest swing against them|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dJ|nt|Walddk4: 3@D  2-5-2-4    4@D  Natural, slammish|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|granguru: it is hard not to make 11 tricks|pg||
pc|sT|nt|josj: X seems logical but maybe I've been playing mp too much, of late|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|geot: If S already knew the whole distribution he may go for 6@D, the superior contract. But 6@H, 6NT will make too|pg||
nt|Walddk4: He knew the shape after 3@D|pg||
nt|geot: wd, good bidding (I guess:))|pg||
pc|s6|nt|mariner1: 5N likely shows the holding and the void|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@D could have been a stiff|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But he could have asked for more info with 3@H|pg||
nt|ralfwil: even 7nt on a squeeze or double finess in @s witn the lucky @h distribution. but of course the right contract|pg||
nt|geot: yes 6@D is a lovely contract|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s5|nt|werge: ok|pg||
pc|sK|pc|d2|pg||
nt|april7: S has a perfect reopening X, thats my opinion|pg||
nt|josj: mine as well|pg||
nt|josj: hej Hans|pg||
nt|lestergold: north hasnt doubled because he likes diamonds too much he cant be sure of not pushing them into a making major|pg||
pc|s3|pc|d5|nt|yo_yo: easy game bridge, thinks helge|pg||
nt|cicus: it seems the best line is to try and ruff a spade|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sA|pg||
pc|s7|nt|mariner1: ok to bypass 5 level as no way 3 controls and a solid @H suit would not be at least|pg||
nt|mariner1: good enough for 6|pg||
nt|cicus: even with 6-2 he will survive as west can only ruff at the cost of his trump trick|pg||
nt|lestergold: dont double low levekl contracts for penalties unless u are sure u can double their runner too|pg||
nt|april7: Thats true, but it is a reopening X by S|pg||
nt|lestergold: distinguished kibbuitzer has pointed out that 3n cold for n/s same nine tricks as 3cl! but whose bidding it?|pg||
nt|ady: flat|pg||

mb|2S!|mb|p|nt|mcphee: now 3NT is horrid|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: fourth highest from longest works well here :)|pg||
nt|chick: I dunno, with 8 tricks in the red suits, only needs to get one black trick before EW get their 5, defense has to be excellent|pg||
nt|mcarroll: S may get too high very easily|pg||
nt|ady: poor vuln multi     will struggle in 2@S with a good hand opposite|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mariner1: the @H lead gives him some hope|pg||
nt|mcphee: ok more on Zar|pg||
nt|daman: awful bid|pg||
pc|d4|nt|geot: A bit strange contract in CR, but quite natural even though they have 5-3 in spades, and a very strong 6-1 in hearts|pg||
nt|mcphee: you can locate in wikipedia|pg||
nt|lestergold: well slam is makeable here|pg||
pc|d9|nt|mcphee: even a explorer search|pg||
nt|josj: easily enough with some help from the KGB|pg||
nt|april7: finally a slam on finding the Q of @H|pg||
nt|mcphee: E is pretty good here for this bidding|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|geot: Furunes rebid was 2D, and West made a reasonable pass|pg||
nt|chick: for those who don't play multi, 2@S shows better hearts|pg||
nt|granguru: Geir helgemo is forbidden to play for Norway for a year...thats why we do not see him with helness or any other|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Maybe S is familiar with pd's idea of a vulnerable Multi in 1st seat|pg||
nt|granguru: 2@D is probably a multi opening..one meaning is weak in a major|pg||
nt|granguru: He was suspended...|pg||
nt|ady: very weak|pg||
pc|s8|nt|mcphee: he wants to bid it|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes its a good slam because it maskes on eitehr a 3/3 dim break or finding the heart q which is well odds in favour as one often obtains a count or at least an inferential count ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: with so many high cards on hands like this|pg||
nt|april7: 6 controls |pg||
nt|april7: W will bid 6 NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: wants to correct this to 6N!|pg||
nt|april7: he should|pg||
nt|lestergold: knows pard has only three hearts|pg||
nt|april7: yes|pg||
nt|josj: 6@H plays itself|pg||
nt|mcphee: i would bid NT as W now as the @S layout might be problemsome with the lead going through @S values|pg||
nt|april7: might not be easy to locate Q of @H|pg||
nt|josj: complete crossruff, probably an overtrick|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes ironically the 4/3 fit makes even he doesnt find the heart q|pg||
nt|josj: very nice contract indeed :)|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|pc|sA|pg||
nt|mariner1: Tor has a decision here|pg||
nt|chick: @D or @S|pg||
nt|mariner1: he will get one more chance though|pg||
nt|mcphee: yes, if this is the place it reasts|pg||
nt|daman: "How to embarrass yourself in front of 950 kibiyzers"|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|lestergold: and 6N went off we see in open room|pg||
nt|josj: both black suits well-placed for crossruff purposes...|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mcphee: ok 6NT was perfectly reasonable|pg||
nt|lestergold: well an opportunity here for a big swing|pg||
nt|josj: but as expected, they can't believe how well they were bidding, actually :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: of course the dim break will reveal the dim length in niorth hand and it may not be eassy tio place north with 4 hearts as well|pg||
nt|mcphee: Barry Crane claims, playing the Q lies over the J|pg||
nt|lestergold: i can see how this must have failed|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North will not want to cash @DKQ - that would rather tip his hand - but the diamond blockage presents problems |pg||

pc|c4|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||

nt|april7: cash 2 @S and rest @C and endplay N with J of @D:)|pg||

pc|hJ|pg||

mb|p|nt|yo_yo: should i now..|pg||
nt|yo_yo: is that weak or strong NT?|pg||
nt|sybarra: its 15 |pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: he might make this|pg||
nt|cicus: seems like EW will win the bidding battle|pg||
nt|april7: a difficult 4 @S again|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: at these colors the S hand might risk 2C, though the major suit holdings are not auspicious. still, it is probable we want a club lead & they won't double before they bid spades|pg||
nt|mcphee: nice toy to have when you have this hand|pg||
nt|mcarroll: looks like 6@D|pg||
nt|ady: 6@D  for n/s|pg||
nt|daman: yes   just a matter of controls now|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|mariner1: might not get DBL though|pg||
nt|april7: 14-16 probably|pg||
nt|yo_yo: he's not serious about raising?|pg||
nt|sybarra: junk stayman|pg||
nt|april7: why stayman with 7 vis-a-vis 14-16?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Seems to be really thinking about raising?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: we need to know the NT range  - maybe he's top of the range|pg||
mb|4S|nt|geot: they did|pg||
nt|cicus: S could have doubled, planning to bid @ds later|pg||
nt|mcphee: this is not a great 3N mind you|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm betetr not tohave kit like this if u are going to play in a silly contract instead of the frigid spade game|pg||
nt|mcphee: well this might make:)|pg||
nt|april7: if they don't touch @D S makes 3NT with @C suit|pg||
nt|mcphee: will play for 3-3 @C as only shot|pg||
nt|mariner1: he is lucky @H are 4 4 and @c are 3 3|pg||
nt|lestergold: it might but why play in it when 4s is more or less throw against the wall infrangible|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: for those interested in Norway, can i recommend a wonderful clip from the BBC on youtube|pg||
nt|geot: that opening was very tough I must admit|pg||
nt|ady: anyhone for 3@S after response of 2@D?|pg||

mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|mariner1: DBL is support showing 3 @S|pg||
nt|mariner1: N should realize S has no wasted @H values,,, and maybe a stiff @H|pg||
nt|geot: 14-16|pg||
nt|daman: looks like NS will end up in 4@S|pg||
mb|3H!|mb|p|nt|chick: opposite a decent 5 card spade suit, S has only 3 losers (hopefully no immediate club ruff)|pg||
nt|sybarra: 7 top tricks |pg||
nt|yo_yo: another flat hand    what's on tv?|pg||
nt|april7: 2NT - pass|pg||

mb|3S|nt|sybarra: news/weather?|pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@D multi here showing big balanced hand|pg||
nt|mcphee: I can not imagine not reaching game|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2n cant be touched|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: and will probably fail|pg||
mb|3N|nt|lestergold: i can why should west raise with a J|pg||
mb|p|nt|josj: @CK gains in stature now|pg||
nt|daman: 3NT has a chance|pg||
mb|4S|nt|mdgraham: 4@S is no thing of beauty on thr defence of three rounds of hearts|pg||
nt|ralfwil: of course a @d favour|pg||
nt|april7: the only bid allowed to pass is 2NT=23-24|pg||
nt|mcphee: because you are playing IMPS|pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: natural|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well stayman with 2 4 card majors i suppose kis a risk some take|pg||
nt|mcphee: and game may easily make in a major or NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: yes however it can still make|pg||
nt|chick: yes, ok only because Kx@S onside|pg||
nt|chick: and 3-2 clubs so can get to dummy for a spade finesse|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Rogaland and Vest Agder are names of rwo of the counties in Norway (about 20 in total) located on the south and southwest coast of Norway |pg||
nt|mariner1: Tor not enthralled with his chances looking at dummy|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Rune Hauge sponsors the Rogaland team, but none of the players reside in that county|pg||
nt|mcphee: some days your partner has 5@D|pg||
nt|ady: easy lead |pg||
pc|cA|nt|mcarroll: and football Kath|pg||
nt|april7: here we have an easy 8 trick , @H are blocked|pg||
nt|chick: they have to get their 3 club tricks immediately, otherwise one can go away on hearts|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|nt|yo_yo: if only he could get to dummy|pg||
nt|frankaus: this maybe hard to make|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ah no, to his hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: easy on club lead|pg||
nt|yo_yo: not sure North will find K@C lead|pg||
nt|cindy: or club to the 9|pg||
nt|josj: it worked well here...on a @C lead, 4@H will make|pg||
nt|april7: 1down on normal defence|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|chick: nice falsecard|pg||
nt|mariner1: Wojo pointing out that N needs the J@D to make this best defense, and of course N|pg||
nt|mariner1: has the J@D|pg||
nt|cindy: doest matter what they lead|pg||
nt|marlowepi: they ahve top lead SOMETHING. then how do they get 5 tricks?|pg||
nt|cindy: lolol|pg||
nt|cindy: i see an easy 9|pg||
nt|lestergold: irony here is that ten tricks would be there if west had the entries to make leads up|pg||
nt|mariner1: no entry W hurts|pg||
nt|josj: had E been declarer, it would have been a different story...|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c9|pc|c5|nt|lestergold: well draw trumps play three rounds of dims and defence have to play clubs or they can let it thru|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|yo_yo: how's england doing , isnt it the test match?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mdgraham: no choices now - will certainly not play for singleton @SK offside |pg||
nt|sybarra: will he run the 10 fo @C?|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cQ|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|mariner1: now he needs kx @S on side and 3 2 @c and that is what he has|pg||
pc|dT|nt|mcphee: E trumps were too strong!|pg||
nt|ady: needs Queen to save a trick|pg||

pc|h4|pc|h3|pc|hA|pg||

nt|lestergold: one netry to playJ spades from hand|pg||
nt|april7: but there is none|pg||

nt|marlowepi: given that partner couldn;t overcall nonvul vs vul, E might have only 3 spades, and the D king looks poorly placed, "scary" is a distinct underbid|pg||

mb|2S|nt|mariner1: 2@S showing @S and a minor?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: very diplomatic Rob, that use of the word "might"|pg||
nt|marlowepi: don;t know why partner has to have that many spades, nor do i have any desire to defend 1HX before i know if we have a grand slam|pg||
nt|cicus: I admit I'd be tempted to bid 4@S even over 1@H|pg||
nt|mariner1: 5@D makes here so the save worked|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Seems impossible to make 7?|pg||
nt|granguru: Helness said that he thought that 4@d would have been natural, i was told|pg||
mb|4H|nt|geot: the problem in defence is taht the clubs are blocked|pg||

mb|p|nt|lestergold: but he penalty in 4h available as an alternative|pg||

nt|april7: @C discard on 4th @S, if @C trick is not developed|pg||
nt|mariner1: if declarer in @H carelessly pulls trumps then its off more than 1|pg||

nt|mcphee: he already stated his hand was offensive for @D|pg||
pc|s6|nt|mariner1: in Open W had bid 3N which guaranteed @H cards so E was assured of a set|pg||
pc|sA|nt|april7: I think the X was not well judged|pg||
nt|lestergold: striped tail|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|chick: oops|pg||
nt|marlowepi: WOW-|pg||
nt|yo_yo: he does have an Ginormous hand|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I had not opened 4@h. for me it´s too strong|pg||
nt|geot: To set it west must have led a club, and overtake Easts C Q in the second trick, then give E a ruff for the singleton S5|pg||
nt|geot: setting trick would then have been the spade K. Now declarer will try the diamonds, but actually he dont need to, clubs are blocked|pg||
nt|josj: or it says: don't lead a heart...|pg||
pc|s8|nt|mariner1: so 2@S showed C or the red suits|pg||
nt|chick: 4@S should have been fast arrival, don't you think?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3H = can you bid game?   4S = i guess i'll give it a shot    6S = OK, then let;'s play slam|pg||
nt|cindy: lol|pg||
nt|cindy: moving targets|pg||
nt|cindy: only 1 trick short on non trump lead  :o|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but just look at what a HUGE difference it would make if one of S's clubs were another spade. the 3-card trump length is a big negative|pg||
nt|cindy: yes|pg||
nt|chick: and a good reason not to try the slam|pg||
nt|cindy: N contributed with 2@s|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in all fairness, S probably thought he DID have four spades--after all, he made a takeout double|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Erichsen thinks he can count 12 tricks and I sympathize with that|pg||
nt|chick: perhaps next time, Furunes will opt for 1@HX :)|pg||
nt|cindy: would you bid 2@s with all those heart cards ?|pg||
nt|mcphee: i also think dble not so great|pg||
nt|april7: 5@D makes because of Jx in @C!!!|pg||
nt|mcphee: the lure of the singleton @C|pg||
nt|mariner1: even if jxx it makes|pg||
nt|josj: good lead, anyway; in that respect, the X worked well|pg||
nt|lestergold: double for lead not unreasonabloe south knows that only a spade is going to have a chance of denting this contract as it happens it cant be dented|pg||
pc|sK|nt|yo_yo: another exciting 1NT|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s7|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i might bid 4|pg||
nt|chick: I would|pg||
nt|lestergold: in gweneral im in favour of doubling form leads with the attendant risks|pg||
nt|granguru: 7@H could have been made with a @h lead or after ruffing the 4th @S with a small @H|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ady: re-hi all    had computer problem|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|h3|nt|ralfwil: The @d can alsi be 3-3|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 5@Cx would have been interesting|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mdgraham: think 500/800 depending on the defence|pg||
nt|april7: because of 10 and 9 of @C droping, 7 tricks only, on good defence though|pg||
pc|s9|nt|mcphee: for sure Mike|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i am not sure what 12 tricks he would be counting. pd can have 4 spades|pg||
nt|chick: 2@S, not 4|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hT|pc|hJ|nt|mcphee: costs very little and often reqarding|pg||
nt|granguru: rehi David|pg||
nt|daman: re|pg||
nt|chick: now @CA and @C hoping for an endplay to avoid one of the @D losers|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|cindy: im not saying i would pass    i would bid 1@s|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i thought you said you were agressive!|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think 1S has a lot going for it--it is unlikely to end the auction|pg||
nt|cindy: only when its right|pg||
nt|cindy: those hearts cant be worth anything|pg||
nt|lestergold: indeed|pg||
nt|lestergold: we know as commentatiors how important the opening lead is|pg||
nt|mcphee: not that many folks redble, maybe that will change|pg||
nt|mcphee: door|pg||
nt|lestergold: east has an easy redouble probably didnt want them sabing in hearts - too cheap|pg||
pc|h7|pc|c5|nt|mariner1: told they play suction, or yeslek in Norway (Kelsey backwards)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|geot: this will give MT 9 imps and lead down to 9|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|mcarroll: down 1 now|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c6|pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i dont think cindy is being unaggressive with 1S. it is a calculated gamble. when W does not bid, chances are that S has a strong hand. bidding 1S lets S reveal the nature of that ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hand, and if partner does bid again there should be little problem getting to game, and alternative games can be explored|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cA|pc|c8|pc|c7|pg||
nt|granguru: in fact, per the Movie, declarer lead a @H toward dummy at trick 2 (@S lead; played by East) and South ducked...|pg||
pc|h4|pc|c9|nt|yo_yo: well who knows how to bid freaks|pg||
pc|h9|nt|lestergold: a seaty monment for east but he cant go wrong|pg||
nt|granguru: 4@s anyone here?|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|ady: hi all|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in my view, the more you tend to double on hands with only 3 spades, like that of S, the better a 1S response looks|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, kath, true enough|pg||
nt|yo_yo: we are quite relaxed over here about doubling with 3@S|pg||
nt|lestergold: sweaty i m,eant|pg||
nt|mariner1: well W didn't have to have A@H could have been kj @H and this is down too|pg||
pc|d5|nt|Walddk4: Good evening to David Edwin|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|geot: here|pg||

nt|april7: bad breaks all over, |pg||
nt|yo_yo: North has a bit of a problem now|pg||

nt|mariner1: @D lead kills 3N here|pg||

pc|sJ|nt|yo_yo: 2@H a bit low, 3@H a bit high|pg||

pc|sA|nt|frankaus: 3@S|pg||
nt|chick: 3N a lot high :)|pg||
nt|cindy: this hand is troublesome for me    good enough for 3@h but dont want to preempt the potential @s fit|pg||
nt|yo_yo: do we like 2@D?|pg||
nt|cindy: thats a thought|pg||
nt|chick: no, with a very weak hand, partner might pass 2@D|pg||
nt|cindy: but then maybe thats ok |pg||

pc|s3|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mdgraham: no :)|pg||
nt|chick: guess not|pg||
nt|cindy: a spec tells me it shows 6 hearts and 3 spades   well thats what he has|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 2@D would help find the right game |pg||
nt|yo_yo: North has a near opener, he might bid on|pg||
pc|d7|nt|mariner1: Chick we have 2 more to play,,,,,,, bribe the dealer :)|pg||
nt|ady: hard to keep out of game   25 hcp|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East will have @SJ on the table so fast|pg||
nt|mdgraham: declarer will hold up for two rounds, but deep down he will know that it is hopeless |pg||
nt|chick: OK, for the next match, I predict interesting hands and big swings :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: he wont pass with 2 Aces and a King|pg||
nt|mcphee: sadly all games fail|pg||
nt|april7: inspite that lead 2 down|pg||
nt|mariner1: cards sitting not nice here|pg||
nt|granguru: already 8|pg||
pc|dT|nt|april7: but S allways passed,what does he show|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 @C?|pg||
nt|april7: best contract till now|pg||
nt|april7: 1down only|pg||
nt|yo_yo: South is wishing he had passed now|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|yo_yo: a control bid from S|pg||
nt|sybarra: in US, we would open the S hand with 1 @D |pg||
nt|mcarroll: anyone transfer with this E hand?|pg||
nt|chick: I think +1|pg||
nt|ady: have done well to stay in 1NT    2 hearts might go down|pg||
pc|c9|nt|ralfwil: With a @h lead, declarer must play the @hA|pg||
nt|geot: Thats right. I think Tundal will play for one heart honor with E. But it is a heart guess anyway. Lets see...|pg||
nt|sybarra: with a nice rebid of 2 @C |pg||
nt|april7: good idea to have a easy rebid|pg||
nt|yo_yo: we wouldnt like that bid here|pg||
pc|c7|nt|cindy: i kind of like that 3N agreement|pg||
nt|yo_yo: so do i|pg||
nt|cindy: 3 choices of places to play with one bid|pg||

nt|yo_yo: another rubbish 11 count bites the dust|pg||
nt|sybarra: N wishing S was playing 3 @C |pg||

nt|chick: I would transfer although in this hand it might not be as good|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|pg||
nt|frankaus: certaily solved this problem 4 them|pg||
nt|granguru: W looking for 9 tricks!|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mdgraham: ok, one round|pg||
nt|mariner1: he knew E had 2 @S so its all where A and J of @c are to start|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|cindy: yes|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d9|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if West has @CA it is hopeless, so may as well play him for @CJ |pg||
nt|chick: but a fairly rare situation|pg||
nt|ady: 5-3-3-2  with bits outside  I think  is borderline|pg||
pc|s9|nt|chick: best hope is that E has @CA and W the red queens, but of course nothing will work|pg||
nt|ady: cant understand duck of club|pg||
nt|ady: could be 9th trick|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that duck may have cost - West gets lucky |pg||
nt|mariner1: yes and you know its off by rising|pg||
nt|chick: agree, David, seems extremely dangerous|pg||
nt|josj: yes, I remember those days :)|pg||
nt|april7: 4 10s|pg||
pc|s8|nt|sybarra: althought looking at W hand,  3 @C is not a great contract |pg||
pc|sT|pc|s4|pg||
pc|s7|nt|cindy: true but how often do you want to bid a natural 3N after 1@h 1@s|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s5|nt|mdgraham: four hearts and three diamonds later, and a dirty look form East|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|hA|nt|chick: about as often as you have 63 and pard bids the 3 card suit|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|h6|pg||

nt|mdgraham: it's not a bad suit, and fitting diamond cards|pg||
nt|mariner1: and now the last board of this session|pg||
nt|mariner1: a big THANKS! to Marita Roberg (Norway), our superb operator, for doing an|pg||
nt|mariner1: excellent job!!!|pg||
nt|mariner1: Many thanks to the Norwegian Premier League, The Norwegian Bridge Federation,|pg||
nt|mariner1: Inger Hjellemarken and Harald Skjaeran and all the organizers for helping BBO|pg||
nt|mariner1: bring us the vugraphs|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but as has been pointed out, 3@H takes a lot of room  in a 2/1 system.  |pg||
nt|ady: another chance for n/s to close the gap|pg||
nt|granguru: looks like 4@h is an easy task...even 11 tricks possible|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mariner1: played we had issues starting|pg||
nt|cindy: this and one more now|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: and thanks for their wit and insight to my co-commentators Cornelia Yoder (USA),|pg||
nt|mariner1: Mike Graham and David Edwin (England), and Roland Wald (Denmark).....I am Rob|pg||
nt|mariner1: Brown (USA)........|pg||
nt|mariner1: Roland Wald (Denmark) is the BBO vugraph co-ordinator and works diligently at it!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You can make 6@C and 6NT, but not 6@H|pg||
nt|mariner1: Last but not least, a round of applause for our hosts: Fred, Sheri, Uday, Bill Gates,|pg||
nt|mariner1: Sharon Osberg, and David Smith. Without them there would have been no|pg||
nt|mariner1: broadcasts. Thanks a lot for creating a site that is greatly appreciated by bridge|pg||
nt|mariner1: lovers worldwide!|pg||
nt|ady: thx    sorry arriving late|pg||
nt|ady: lol|pg||
nt|mariner1: 23 minutes until next session is scheduled|pg||
nt|yo_yo: another 11 count   this time 4441|pg||
nt|ady: I think this shows  5 spades and 4 of a minor|pg||
mb|4S|nt|yo_yo: t/fer to 1nt?|pg||
nt|chick: 2@S presumably spades+minor|pg||
nt|mcarroll: yes everything lies well|pg||
nt|granguru: What a hard moment for Svendsen|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Difficult to reach 4@H now lol!|pg||
nt|ady: can only make on a diamond or trump lead|pg||
nt|ady: west considering|pg||
nt|ady: in fact cant make on any lead|pg||
nt|granguru: deep finesse in @c to make 5@H|pg||
mb|d|nt|marlowepi: 2C could work very well here, though obviously 2S is the pedestrian bid|pg||
nt|geot: not Ringnes...Mac Gold, eller Steinlager (ja, akkurat som hesten) heter ølet her. JEg er i New Zealand:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: pointless for N to bid 4@h|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Furunes wont want to excite his partner|pg||
nt|chick: E is likely to have some hearts, but very unlikely to have any points, which means finessing will be tough|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: 6@C and 6NT are cold on any lead if you read it|pg||
nt|mariner1: we do not have result on 32 posted|pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: opps den var til spectator....hihi|pg||
nt|mcphee: just a matter of how many tricks he can manage|pg||
nt|ady: yes     lucky lay for 11 tricks in hearts|pg||
pc|hT|nt|cicus: were these beers?|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ady: yes  west in trouble  and can be end played|pg||
nt|chick: but 6@H will be the first choice|pg||
pc|hK|nt|marlowepi: spades rank higher than hearts, so if W can raise them i want pd to know where my values are. also, 2C may slow the opps down, and they may let us play a "belated" 4H, thinking we ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: have perhaps 8 hearts|pg||
nt|yo_yo: do we like that opener?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: some always open 2 aces and a K|pg||
nt|april7: with 5 controls its ok!|pg||
nt|mariner1: @S nice play|pg||
nt|mariner1: J@S|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|ady: n/s tried 3NT in the other room    this is cheaper|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mariner1: Roland means you have to pitch 5 times in W so squeeze|pg||
nt|cindy: is this a forcing auction now ?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: must be|pg||
nt|cindy: i usually play the opps can always play 4@s|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h7|nt|mcphee: yes, unblocked his suit|pg||
nt|mcphee: lack of table entries|pg||
nt|april7: @H first|pg||
nt|mcphee: so is likely to work on @H first|pg||
nt|mcphee: played from S you get a @H lead and life is easy|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|ady: n/s have closed the gap|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i am not fond of 4441s at the best of times|pg||
nt|april7: don't cover!|pg||
nt|mcarroll: A lot better than some openings we have seen for me it is fine as there is no rebid problem|pg||
nt|yo_yo: the @S 8 saves the day|pg||
pc|s3|nt|yo_yo: will North be calculating the LTT?|pg||
nt|frankaus: 2@S - @H raise limit or better as we play it here|pg||
nt|chick: same here|pg||
nt|cicus: probably an overtrick here|pg||
pc|s4|nt|yo_yo: or as it's called here the LTB |pg||
nt|cicus: either by leading towards @HJ or taking 2 club tricks|pg||
pc|s9|nt|mdgraham: South will be wishing he was in a slam here - for a moment|pg||
nt|april7: N will need a @H trick for the contract|pg||
nt|josj: or the @SK...|pg||
nt|april7: twice then ace of @Dand @D|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|s2|nt|april7: @C and @H 10|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sA|nt|april7: on general principle, just ducking is not always good|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|josj: this time, E did well to duck both @HK and @CK|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|marlowepi: probably close to a universal treatment. whether it is the best bid tactically (as opposed to descriptively), however, is another issue|pg||
nt|cicus: only problem is to get off dummy|pg||
nt|ady: 5@H only 10 tricks  as a spec pointed out  in spite of the fortunate lay of clubs|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ady: good news for south|pg||
nt|cicus: after @D ruff|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s6|pg||
nt|chick: one of those hands where you HOPE everything is off, and it is this time |pg||
nt|april7: best lead now @C|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|c8|pc|c5|nt|sybarra: thought I was going to make it til, end, but have to dash,  have fun all |pg||
nt|sybarra: :)|pg||
nt|april7: 9 of @C is the entry to @H or @S trick|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ty shirley|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|ady: but can make 4@H   so this is a good save|pg||
pc|c6|nt|josj: 9 tricks now|pg||
pc|c2|nt|april7: still problems,because N can t cash ace of @D|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|mdgraham: can claim now|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|mariner1: even with this board there are not a lot of imps scored in 16 boards|pg||
nt|ady: more than halved the gap|pg||

mb|d!|nt|mariner1: 5@H a little too much here in Open|pg||
nt|granguru: NS might have a hard time playing 4@H here|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|geot: yes 32 I mean|pg||
nt|cicus: could be duplicated, though|pg||

nt|ady: hi Martin|pg||

pc|d4|nt|chick: W didn't dare risk giving up the lead until he had trumped his spades, now -1|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d3|pg||
pc|d8|nt|Walddk4: Please keep it someone, I am not in this room constantly|pg||
nt|geot: spade would also have been terrible for the defence. Now they had a chance to set it twice |pg||
pc|d9|pc|dK|pc|s2|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Gabor?|pg||
pc|dT|pc|s5|pc|c2|pc|s6|pg||
pc|d7|pc|s8|nt|granguru: S didnt try for the stiff @SQ|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c9|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s9|nt|cicus: sry, had a phone call|pg||
nt|geot: but when S underled his heart A declarer could have won 4@D. Oh well, it will end with 1 down |pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sT|pc|sJ|pc|h7|pg||
pc|c6|nt|chick: now defense must find the trump promotion|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But I think he had a count on N. 2@d, 5@h probably 4@c and only 2@s! do you agree?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|cindy: hi all |pg||
nt|geot: dont have to be like that the clubs, but yes, very close|pg||
nt|granguru: W claiming|pg||

nt|chick: Hello Everyone|pg||
nt|mdgraham: good evening all|pg||
nt|mariner1: Welcome to be Norwegian Premier League 2009/2009 from Trondheim, Norway|pg||
nt|mariner1: hi cornelia and mike :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.bridgefederation.no/t2.aspl  - Tournament site|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://www.bridgefederation.no/t2.asp|pg||
nt|mariner1: 1st link has an extra "l" in there|pg||
nt|chick: hi Cindy|pg||
nt|frankaus: welcome cindy marshall|pg||
nt|ady: compensation last hand  3@d can go down 1|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: ty frank|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hi|pg||
nt|yo_yo: you are surrounded Frank|pg||
mb|3C|nt|chick: he loves it :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Sven-Olai Høyland one of three brothers in the Hordaland 1 team. The other two are Same Inge and Jim|pg||
mb|p|nt|cindy: :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: In fact  S bid 3@h and perhaps 3@c with 3@h and 5@c|pg||
nt|geot: I am surprised S played that heart. North followed trumps from below, not asking for H ?|pg||
nt|daman: like soothing a wound with Tiger Balm|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|frankaus: used to it  - live with wife - have to daughters|pg||
nt|april7: 2@S already 1 down|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that 2NT is a bit thin|pg||
nt|sybarra: Pard apparently took him seriously |pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: two |pg||
nt|cindy: wouldnt you bid 1N with N hand ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: is Wests bid weak 2?or tartan?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|cicus: now NS  ha sto find their ruff|pg||
pc|s5|nt|cicus: ace of spades lead, then...|pg||
nt|cicus: not any more|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 2NT is too much with a singleton spade and only 8 hcp|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good morning to Bob McPhee from Canada|pg||
pc|s9|nt|chick: I wouldn't|pg||
nt|yo_yo: a cowardly pass |pg||
nt|cicus: hmm, don't seem they have 10 tricks anyway|pg||
nt|sybarra: or maybe just talking E out of bidding?|pg||
nt|april7: N escaped the X|pg||
nt|april7: loserwise there could be a @C game and S might try for it,but game will fail on bad distribution|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|cindy: white vs red   keeps them from bidding nt    good values|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i mean i would bid a cowardly pass|pg||
nt|mcphee: hello all|pg||
nt|josj: gm Bob|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c7|nt|vugraphzdu: 2@H is Tartan|pg||
nt|april7: hello Bob|pg||
pc|c2|nt|cindy: hand is nothing to be ashamed of|pg||
nt|chick: but you don't know if partner can say the same :)|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|april7: on @h lead a good guess will help|pg||
nt|josj: 5@C looks sensible enough, yes - but not if you're playing for money|pg||
nt|april7: @D 10 lead is probably best|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|cindy: how much can N have   he is passed hand   and has 9 hcp and 3 10s|pg||
nt|cindy: i just worry about my cards|pg||
nt|cindy: partner is on his own|pg||
nt|mcphee: this is a game you would like to be in I think|pg||
nt|josj: maybe, W is squeezed in the end...|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c4|pc|cA|pg||
pc|sT|nt|yo_yo: i have good defence and they are vulnerable|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|nt|cindy: that is true|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|geot: Good chance now. Will lead a club after trumps. Then knock out the spade A for discard|pg||
nt|april7: @D is probably best return for the dcefence|pg||
nt|mcphee: seems to me this has a very good play|pg||
nt|mcphee: the defence is not able to lead @H|pg||
nt|ady: same again   3@C  down 1   converted to 3NT down 1|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|geot: losing two clubs and a spade|pg||
nt|cicus: oh yes|pg||
nt|geot: Good result for VA this one, cant see he will go wrong now, so probably +620|pg||
pc|h4|nt|april7: good duck by W,otherwise only 1 down|pg||
nt|josj: @C9 might be difficult to cope with|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s8|pg||
nt|mcphee: yes it will be now that has trumped low|pg||
pc|s3|pc|h6|pc|h7|pc|d7|pg||
nt|mcphee: trump not so bad|pg||
nt|april7: N will try @C finesse and contract will then fail on @C return|pg||
nt|mcphee: too bad 3-1 @C this hand really|pg||
nt|josj: and @S 5-1 as well :(|pg||
pc|s7|nt|geot: the point of the declaring was the timing, playing a club after drawing trumps|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lestergold: hi  Mike fromUK here|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mcphee: awesome move|pg||
mc|8|nt|josj: hi Mike|pg||
nt|april7: if finesse would succeed and @C 2-2 then it would be ok|pg||
nt|mcphee: still things are not hopeless here|pg||
pg||
