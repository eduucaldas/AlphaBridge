mb|d|nt|vugraphzgj: sorry - sleeping|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 5-5 in clubs who cares any more?|pg||

nt|jcomyn: and 4-4 in D by opps|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 5-4|pg||
mb|p|nt|cliveo: Which makes it difficult for them to find their 5-5 club fit|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and us ordinary mortals go 1S-1Nt-2C and bops your uncle|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: a conservative pass by N|pg||
nt|mariner1: hi Al :)|pg||
nt|woozle: of course, NS didn't even think about such a foolish game|pg||
mb|3H|nt|henryb: Not so conservative when partner's range is 14-16|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we're at it again, aye Rob|pg||
nt|mariner1: not a lot of action expected on this board.|pg||
nt|woozle: might make 5 if East doesn't return a diamond|pg||

pc|h6|nt|xenya: yes|pg||

nt|cliveo: Well done. So though Ireland were in an inferior contract to Wales it has only cost them 1 IMP|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think moscito would have opened East 1N -- so probably back to 2/1 pairs |pg||

nt|cliveo: This time points evenly divided, looks like a heart spade battle|pg||

nt|woozle: is 3C weak?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on NZ pair in Beijing played 2-under transfers with other things looking Moscito like|pg||
nt|mariner1: in Oz,,,,,,, my typing is horrible these days|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S makes..... and even 6@S|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Good morning David, Phil and Clive|pg||
nt|ady: good morning|pg||
nt|woozle: that might silence everybody|pg||
nt|mariner1: even 7@S|pg||
nt|mariner1: ruff out 2@D and claim|pg||
nt|ahollan1: I sure hope 2@H is transfer showing contructive @S raise or better|pg||
mb|4S|nt|jcomyn: mm both thought of bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: hi all|pg||
nt|cliveo: However, Kurbalija stopped the spades being introduced|pg||
nt|woozle: or not...3D is an interesting effort|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: probably about down one|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i must say -- 1@D was flawless|pg||
nt|woozle: 3D might get some partscores right, but it carries big risks, like missing spade games|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but even if it does - this doesn't look like best way to start describing the hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: ok|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Hi Sharyn and John|pg||
nt|sharynr: hey Roland and John :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hi Shariyn|pg||
nt|vugraphzgj: having a few connections problems.  Going to try taking computer back into room now it is connected!!|pg||
nt|sharynr: John, would you have bid over 2D?|pg||
nt|sharynr: with the south hand, that is /|pg||
nt|jcomyn: plenty of hcp but distribution not helpful|pg||
nt|sharynr: I agree|pg||
nt|jcomyn: depends on partner. Not sure|pg||
nt|jcomyn: keep attacking trumps|pg||
nt|sharynr: well the "math" seems to lean toward passing...since the most you can expect is a bad 9 from pard|pg||
nt|sharynr: I wonder if there is still a connection problem|pg||
nt|jcomyn: looks likely|pg||
nt|henryb: this should be 2 down|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes it does seem an unusual call|pg||
pc|h7|nt|phil_20686: Al together too early for bridge IMO, alarm felt awfully early this morning :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Forrester - Bakhshi  E-W  for England|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S  the limit|pg||
nt|cliveo: Both teams had a poor start yesterday, England losing 17-13 to their B team and Scotland 25-3 to the Republic of Ireland|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Adamson - Martin   N-S  for Scotland|pg||
nt|mariner1: can they find the nice slam here?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|cliveo: Interestingly, both England and Scotland run trials to select their teams, and have not had a good result in the Camrose for some years with this method, whereas the Republic of ...|pg||
nt|cliveo: Ireland have picked the same team year in, year out, and have not been beaten for some years|pg||
nt|vugraphzgj: connection problems :(|pg||
nt|cliveo: You will find that every year, the composition of the English and Scottish teams is totally different from the previous year|pg||
nt|cliveo: Indeed, England won the silver medal at the Beijing Mind Games and yet only one pair from that team is playing this weekend|pg||
nt|jcomyn: club|pg||
nt|woozle: pass would have likely scored +50 - diamond lead, spade switch|pg||
nt|mariner1: so 2@H had to have been @S support|pg||
nt|ahollan1: without knowing all the NS agreements -- this sequence sounds like 3@D=game try|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm just assuming transfer responses over the Takeout DBL|pg||
nt|mariner1: I like the 2@H treatment here....|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i like it for game investigation, but looks cumbersome for slam invite|pg||
nt|ahollan1: North doesn't know if jump was because of @D honors - or shortness|pg||
pc|h3|nt|cliveo: If Garvey wins and switches to a club this should go one off|pg||
nt|sga1: No looks -1|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|cliveo: Adamson-Martin are one of the top lady Scottish pairs, and have done very well to win their place. The Scots, in fact, have three ladies in their team as Liz McGowan is playing ...|pg||
nt|cliveo: with David Liggatt|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|phil_20686: It has always been my feeling that straight teams trials will seldom produce the best team|pg||
nt|ady: the hearts in the South hand are not strong enough to win twice  otherwise 4@S could go down|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|nt|sga1: sry u r right|pg||
nt|henryb: 3@c, 2@h and a @d|pg||
nt|sga1: Not any more|pg||
nt|woozle: now maybe club, club, third club for the trump demotion|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what is bug's option?   Neg DBL -- but no rebid after 3@H, PASS hoping for reopening double - then ?3@S?|pg||
nt|woozle: I'd pass, then 4S|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and one off|pg||
nt|henryb: but now may make|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 5@H must be 1st or 2nd round control - and very discouraging for North - who now knows 4@S was based upon @D shortness rather than honors|pg||
nt|mariner1: does S see slam now?|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cQ|nt|Walddk4: what about a trump lead?|pg||
nt|xenya: i don't see how S could bid slam, aceless|pg||
nt|mariner1:  this board could be a big key in match,,,,, since 6 and 7 also make if bid|pg||
pc|cA|nt|cliveo: I agree with Phil|pg||
nt|Walddk4: That would be very inconvenient for declarer|pg||
nt|ahollan1: welcome to no-man's land  2   [ 1=2N,  2=5Major,  3=3Major,  4=4minor]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Hsiangwen hears an auction that screams for a trump lead and does so -- then looks at the rest of his hand|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|mariner1: trump lead as good as any here........ he looks Zugzwang on the opening lead|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ady: Forester m  ust be carefull to p lay 8@H 2nd time if playing from hand|pg||
nt|phil_20686: does not matter, North has no smaller ones left in any event|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but doesnt 4S make|pg||
nt|henryb: will in fact|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now we know double dummy that declarer can take all the tricks -- but at Imps -- first find line to ensure 11 tricks|pg||
nt|mariner1: he heard the @H cue so no @H and @c nor @D looks attractive|pg||
pc|c7|nt|mariner1: 1st mistake would be assuming you have 4 @c tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or even 2 :)|pg||
nt|mariner1: true|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ady: does not matter as AJ109 now in north hand|pg||
nt|cliveo: Some people might think this defence is routine, but time after time the Irish are so accurate in these situations|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|xenya: actually it's not a great slam, looking at NS's hands|pg||
pc|c4|pc|s6|nt|ahollan1: and as here -- how do you feel if 3@C all pass?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: point for the audience -- sometimes preempts make bidding tough|pg||
nt|woozle: 3C all pass is fine - you're facing club length and probably make nothing|pg||
nt|woozle: A crossruff probably falls into 9 tricks here|pg||
nt|woozle: although West's diamond 8 may be a problem on the fourth round of hearts|pg||
pc|d9|nt|phil_20686: North should probably have played one of the JT9 as a matter of technique on teh first round of hearts, but a minor slip|pg||

nt|by: note that N, E, and W are three of taiwan's U26 team that made it to the semis 2008 in beijing, S is W's old partner who place 3rd with him in bandung 2007 PABF U26|pg||
nt|woozle: very good play once the heart ace is onside|pg||
mb|p!|nt|jcomyn: here we go early on a 9-count|pg||
nt|cliveo: John, can you tell us where Garvey and Carroll are based, and whether they play in competitions together outside of internationals?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: still should have been 1 diamond left to dispose of round loser :(|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil_20686: How close do the panel think this is to a 3@c bid?|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|cliveo: Once again the aggressive tactics of the Irish have kept the Welsh out of the bidding, though the Welsh have 24 points and a probable heart game|pg||
pc|h4|nt|phil_20686: Feels close to me, the Kx@s looks like a big holding now|pg||
nt|ady: 6 NT  or 6@C   or 6@S all make    not 6@D|pg||
nt|cliveo: We all know how fine a player Tony is, but he is a particularly strong declarer|pg||
nt|ady: there is a danger of 6@D here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I don't think so|pg||
nt|ady: if Martin gets diamond preference   he might back peddle with a jack high suit|pg||
nt|phil_20686: North will offer 6@c as a matter of course, almost irrespective of how the auction develops|pg||
nt|henryb: 5@d is also reasonable|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i like the 3-card @S raise|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Kieran wins the cupie doll -- i hoped someone would mention 1@C with balanced and transfer responses|pg||
nt|woozle: I usually play 2NT after 1x-1y:2y as a 1-round force, after which 3 card raises bid out shape|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N is overbid - punishes partner for opening sub-strength distrbutional hands|pg||
nt|mariner1: my guess is he played out all the trumps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but reopening DBL with that @H holding is .... non-optimal|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jcomyn: yes TG is in England and JC works in Dublin. No they dont play too often outside internationals. In fact John won the Irish Masters playing with Adam Mesbur|pg||
nt|ahollan1: have any of you played the follow-up to determine if opener has made 3 or 4 card raise?|pg||
nt|woozle: my style rebids 1NT (or opens 1C and plays transfer responses) - I like the raise to suggest four so that partner can jump to game more often|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|Walddk4: N-S are women   Sheila - Anne|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|mariner1: Q@H is an imaginative lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure anybody follows this anymore, but I learned bidding after reopening DBL to first subtract a King, then bid accordingly|pg||
pc|h7|nt|cliveo: I think it unlikely they will bid a slam as with the first set yesterday evening, the cards do lie well for declarer|pg||
nt|phil_20686: (provided only that they get to the 6 level)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hmm -- i hadn't seen the 1 round force treatment before |pg||
nt|ahollan1: duh -- 2N as 1-round force|pg||
nt|mariner1: I like to play 2@C asking over a major, outlawed by ACBL until recently|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that makes West a solid 1N bid|pg||
nt|mariner1: p did bid them so reasonable..... and N has no entry|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mariner1: sort of like drury in but also in 1st and 2nd seat|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Rob -- you mean like Gazzilli?|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s2|nt|ady: now South should get the message and if going to the 6 level  clubs rather than diamonds|pg||
nt|cliveo: what do we make of the 3@d bid - agreeing the suit, or a cue-bid? or even something else?|pg||
nt|mariner1: no|pg||
nt|woozle: 4S now has an overtrick on the menu|pg||
pc|s6|nt|phil_20686: This hand shows the powed of the mixed cue, the k@c is such a big card in the north hand, Many club players still play cues as ace showing, which is inferior|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's natural where I come from|pg||
nt|phil_20686: she just showed a GF raise in diamonds|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|sga1: They r playing 2@s as Baron.|pg||
nt|sga1: I mean 1N - 2@s|pg||
pc|dA|nt|henryb: declarer should actually play a second high heart, then @cA and a @c. |pg||
nt|mariner1: he has time to setup the @c for 2 tricks now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: at this vulnerability - with that @H holding, East knows that West does not have strong hand hoping to defend, so pass and defend well for 100 a trick is much better plan|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d2|nt|phil_20686: could even be 4@d depending on their agreement for inverted minors|pg||
nt|phil_20686: and that pass was unexpected|pg||
nt|cliveo: Well that shows how much we understood of their sequence!|pg||
nt|cliveo: Perhaps the key is that 4@c was not alerted, whereas 2@h, 3@s, 4@h and 4@s all were|pg||
nt|phil_20686: Pass is clearly anti-system, after that many cue bids, but south is worred about her poor diamonds, and opted to get out in a positive|pg||
nt|ady: crouch & Liggins in 6@D   swing for Scotland |pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|c7|nt|ahollan1: i only see 10 :(|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|cliveo: You can see, although not impossible, it was not easy for Rees-Kurbalija to find their heart fit|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|cJ|pc|hK|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c5|nt|woozle: check the club layout|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mariner1: its more like drury..... 2 @c says I have at limit raise, a 2N invitational hand, 3 in a|pg||
nt|mariner1: minor invitational bid or ANY game forcing hand........ over a major and unpassed|pg||
nt|mariner1: hand opposite|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sK|pc|s3|pc|h9|pg||
nt|mariner1: oops|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d8|pc|dQ|pc|d3|pg||
nt|jcomyn: I would have thought Philip would smell a rat on that auction|pg||
nt|cliveo: Indeed, in the open room the Welsh pair did not bid and the Irish pair are playing in 4@h|pg||
mc|8|nt|cliveo: So interestingly, only the Irish players have bid on this hand|pg||

nt|odysseus69: you better ask them - no public announcement - or perhaps ask David Burn- he was also in winning gold cup team|pg||
mb|2C|mb|4C|nt|Walddk2: N-S will interfere violently I suspect|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|nt|odysseus69: Artur loves to bid slams at a sniff|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It was sort of a tongue-in-cheek question|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, not at all|pg||
nt|odysseus69: and tongu-in-cheek reply|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Having a void opposite partner's splinter.  What does one make of that?|pg||
nt|chessmaste: No losers|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I guess Wang did not like the idea of encouraging E-W by raising clubs|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|nt|bjacobs: Mark, you've hit the nail on the head :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|6C|nt|odysseus69: Artur will bid 6H|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Wrong|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: No, 6@C  2 keycards and a void|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: You surely play that gadget too, Victor|pg||
nt|odysseus69: or 6C - I wonder that they have discussed how many key cards 6C shows|pg||
nt|xenya: suppose W has no void -- what does he bid?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5@S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2 + @HQ|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Which would be a "whoops" for East!|pg||
nt|brgpro: 7@c is 1100 and might escape for 800 with some sloppy defence( if W doesnt switch a @s in time)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: I have seen confusion about how many key cards- wouldnt risk 6C without discussion about how many|pg||
nt|bjacobs: You should always remember to check the consequences of a 5@S response when using RKCB|pg||
nt|xenya: so they get to slam missing 2 aces|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Walddk2: Is it winning tactics not to support clubs with the South cards. What do you think?|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cT|pc|hT|pg||
nt|brgpro: u always support when it is right!|pg||
pc|hA|nt|Walddk2: Great philosophy :)|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|bjacobs: It can work a few ways|pg||
pc|c2|pc|h5|pc|h6|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sA|nt|bjacobs: Bidding a lot reduces room for the opps, which is generally helpful for your side|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 5C is routine for me - over 4C - I like to bid 4C when available but 5 over their 4|pg||
mc|12|pg||

nt|henryb: you may be able to avoid the @s finesse|pg||
nt|ahollan1: don't tell me -- @C spots good enough for no loser|pg||
nt|mariner1: in a match this close every trick counts|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i may have convinced myself that North should forcing NT regardless of vul|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ahollan1: don't be surprised if +150 loses a couple of imps [compared to 1@H going down 2 or 3]|pg||
mb|2C|nt|henryb: can they avoid a really silly game?|pg||
nt|woozle: indeed, after the c8 switch|pg||
mb|4C!|nt|mariner1: EW can make 4@S with CAREFUL play......|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: part score in diamonds   |pg||
nt|cliveo: to return to the question of selection, and I know how difficult it is because I was chairman of a rugby selection committee for over 5 years, there has been a lack of consistency ...|pg||
nt|cliveo: in the selection of the England teams. For example Bell and Byrne were not selected for the U28 team in Beijing, and yet have been selected for the England B open team, where ...|pg||
nt|cliveo: indeed they showed their ability yesterday with a very good first 16 boards against the A team|pg||
nt|jcomyn: these tactics won buckets of imps against Scotland - or is it bouquets of imps|pg||
nt|cliveo: Again, they have 24 points between them, but this time Rees was able to get into the action before the Irish had a chance!|pg||
mb|6H!|nt|mariner1: @c good lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wow - red vs white, 2.5+ cover cards -- i think i'd try 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 3 @D limit|pg||
nt|jcomyn: Spelt Filip I believe sorry about that|pg||
nt|cliveo: Don't worry, there are very few Welsh speakers about|pg||
nt|woozle: 2h rebid is 4 hearts, longer clubs?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Bo -- can you translate?|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil_20686: Do we know what these bids mean?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: gone crazy again|pg||
nt|sga1: Yes. they may play 3@d.|pg||
nt|mariner1: now S in a spot|pg||
nt|xenya: i certainly would |pg||
nt|mariner1: yes 4 @S looks reasonable to me too......|pg||
nt|ahollan1: declarer much better off if he knows about the @C10 lead - i.e. can it be from interior sequence or not|pg||
nt|ahollan1: IF possibly interior sequence, @C6 would have been good shot -- 2 minutes ago|pg||
pc|cK|nt|cliveo: The bidding sequences of our top players are so different to the sequences played at our local clubs that it is very difficult for aspiring players to learn from the experts|pg||
nt|mariner1: @D lead here makes this tough|pg||
pc|c3|nt|woozle: then 3C 2425?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ady: 1@H  re-bid shows spades I think|pg||
nt|henryb: harder if you play 2/1 gf. but then you respond 1N|pg||
nt|sga1: yes.|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|cliveo: I agree, otherwise the sequence makes no sense|pg||
nt|phil_20686: I have always found it easy - just ask, top players are normally happy to help, and they all played natural systems once|pg||
nt|jcomyn: will they find it again?|pg||
nt|cliveo: If the Irish keep up their impressive form on defence, this contract will be 1 off after the first four tricks|pg||
nt|jcomyn: Tommy may lead a S however|pg||
nt|cliveo: And as we can see, Ireland got 11 IMPs back on Board 3 through the aggressive tactics of Garvey and Carroll in this room|pg||
nt|vugraphzgj: Carroll tried to lead OOT but Rees stopped him :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: sure he did before CJ hit the table|pg||
nt|vugraphzgj: exactly|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jcomyn: which Ace is the problem|pg||
nt|jcomyn: looking for a signal|pg||
pc|c2|nt|cliveo: yes, but unless you meet the top players personally to speak to them, that is not available to the ordinary club player|pg||
nt|jcomyn: quick arent they|pg||
nt|sharynr: :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: H3 may ask for a Club - dont know|pg||
nt|mariner1: EW play MOSCITO|pg||
pc|h4|nt|woozle: now some sort of control ask?|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|cliveo: Reverse attitude?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: perhaps|pg||
nt|jcomyn: now DA and again signal|pg||
nt|jcomyn: process of elimination|pg||
nt|cliveo: According to the convention card, a high card is discouraging|pg||
nt|cliveo: Convention cards for all the pairs playing this weekend can be found at http://www.bridgegreatbritain.org/homeinternationals/2007/camroseteams.htm|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ahhh -- non-transfer moscito|pg||
nt|woozle: West has plenty of controls, maybe 3H showed a min|pg||
nt|ahollan1: of all the red suits -- that @H3 and @HQ were the only ones NOT worth consideration|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ady: 3@D  was a bit pushy on such a tepid suit   |pg||
nt|ahollan1: Kieran - are you a Mosciot convert?|pg||
pc|c5|nt|sga1: on a trump lead and continuation, real problem for declarer.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or even Moscito|pg||
nt|woozle: No, but I have played relay before|pg||
nt|woozle: looks fairly vanilla|pg||
nt|ahollan1: are these basically Symmetric Relay based?|pg||
nt|woozle: looks like symmetric|pg||
pc|h5|nt|jcomyn: oh dear he let me down|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|woozle: Not sure about the last two bids by West though - he's loaded with controls, I would have thought he'd be taking up more steps|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s8|nt|henryb: now a @h towards dummy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: while bidding continues - my favorite relay story -- 1st hand of 2007 Reisinger, kibitzing Burgess-Marston|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they used ALL bids between 1@C and 2N -- BOTH opponents ran out of PASS cards|pg||
pc|sK|nt|Walddk4: Good morning to Jim Hay from Scotland|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|ahh: morning everyone |pg||
nt|woozle: My favourite, B-M again, is where they relayed to the five level without skipping a step. At that point, Burgess realised that they were both relaying, figured out what he'd shown ...|pg||
nt|woozle: and what Marston needed to keep bidding for so long, and placed the contract correctly|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d4|nt|henryb: should have pitched @c|pg||
nt|ahollan1: more than bidding accuracy, relay may gain more just on increasing blind opening lead syndrome|pg||
pc|d2|nt|xenya: claim 11|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|cliveo: Good morning, Jim. Has the sun risen in Aberdeen yet?|pg||
nt|ady: good morning|pg||
nt|jcomyn: I see defence was found in open room|pg||
nt|cliveo: This contract is not lay-down yet|pg||
nt|vugraphzgj: missed Rees's discard on q@h|pg||
nt|mariner1: has the rest now|pg||
pc|h8|pc|c7|pc|h9|pc|c8|pg||
nt|ahh: it never rises on the good |pg||
pc|sT|nt|jcomyn: D|pg||
nt|cliveo: Nowadays with us all having access to the top players' convention cards, and the amount of top-class instruction you can get from BBO, most aspiring players should be improving ...|pg||
nt|cliveo: their results|pg||
pc|sA|mc|12|nt|woozle: It's often inferior when the replier has extra playing strength, or when the described hand is going to be declarer|pg||

nt|brgpro: well, u will stop RKC for sure. if u know opps is a new pdship u shd do that. difficult to judge without that |pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Wang might also have been a teensy bit concerned about -1100 in 5@C|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 4h ok except on D lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The slam hand was flat. Hanlon did not support clubs either in the other room|pg||

nt|odysseus69: i think it was a case of inability to decide between tough choices so pass and take a plus-sorry but still NO from me|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d9|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Surely if she doesn't like her tough major suit choices, she can offer 3@D|pg||
nt|bjacobs: What's happened is that she has down-valued the stiff club king|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The contract is 3NTX next door|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Played by North|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Hmm, the club attack kills that contract stone dead|pg||
nt|chessmaste: That looks tricky on a club lead|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So now we have to congratulate South?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: now Souths pass will appear to be brilliant |pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cA|pc|c8|pc|s3|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 3NTX could be as much as -800|pg||
nt|odysseus69: I still dont pass|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dT|nt|chessmaste: Let's say South had bid 3@D - North would still have to keep the auction open - and the spade void would hardly appeal|pg||
pc|d6|pc|c6|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|pc|hJ|pc|hT|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Singleton - I remember now she had one!|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Perhaps 3@H by North, 4@H by South.  North does have a tip-top maximum, and partner is inviting|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And 4@H does look makeable (although it might not)|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Yes, then only a diamond to the ace and a diamond leaves declarer with a problem to solve|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h8|pc|hA|pc|h9|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hK|pc|d8|nt|odysseus69: yes spade singleton wouldnt appeal but still might be tempted to bid 3H - probably right to pass 3D - 3NT should not be an option- pass or 3H only|pg||

mb|p|nt|jcomyn: will they allow 4S or go on in D|pg||

nt|mariner1: a good way to defend against relay system is get in early and often....... bid|pg||
nt|mariner1: aggressively|pg||

mb|1S|nt|ahh: at least the Scots were in 4th best contract  unlike England |pg||

nt|woozle: It's good for relay pairs to penalise often - it's good advertising|pg||
nt|woozle: EW probably out of relay now|pg||
mb|p|nt|cliveo: At last we have a contract where the Welsh can make 4@s on best declarer play!|pg||

mb|2S!|nt|Walddk4: 2@D presumably intermediate|pg||

nt|ahh: is that a weak strong jump or a strong weak jump ?|pg||

nt|cliveo: At my club even the LOLs would be jumping on the table|pg||
nt|cliveo: OK, that makes more sense|pg||
nt|sga1: Only 2@c makes for NS.|pg||
nt|henryb: and Wast will rescue North|pg||
nt|sga1: He did.|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahh: hopefully better than the 1st board they played yesterday |pg||
nt|sga1: With a ratchet suit, he bids again after doubling.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S looks like automatic response to me -- but if you take away a King, then bypass the suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahh: 3nt -3|pg||
nt|Walddk4: why?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: oh, not this one|pg||
nt|ahh: ok it was  just only -2 |pg||
nt|phil_20686: I think openeing Sime's hand with that suit is poor|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 3NT is an awful contract, but it makes|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You actually need spades 6-3 with no entry to the long suit|pg||
nt|cliveo: does it definitely make on a @s lead?|pg||
nt|phil_20686: or the @d finesse working|pg||
nt|phil_20686: but that is anti-% given the bidding|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Right Clive, North can switch to hearts after 2 rounds of spades|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But will that happen?|pg||
nt|woozle: Big missed opportunity for NS|pg||
nt|xenya: 12 tricks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: move a small @C from declarer's hand to smal @S -- and 4@S is much better contract than 4@H|pg||
nt|mariner1: I suspect 11 :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|cliveo: A kibbitzer has suggested two rounds of @s and a @h switch defeats the contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|cliveo: Yes, it is easier in double dummy!|pg||
nt|cliveo: If Garvey makes all the right guesses, this is a good vulnerable save against a making non-vulnerable game|pg||
nt|vugraphzgj: sorry thought I had clicked on X but must have been slightly off|pg||
pc|s9|nt|mariner1: so now he makes extras|pg||
nt|ahollan1: here -- the long/strong trump suit it getting tapped|pg||
pc|sT|nt|phil_20686: He would be absolutely correct, but could be letting it through if east has Kxx@Hrather than Kx|pg||
nt|ahh: well for sure this start will not beat it |pg||
nt|mariner1: on 14 4@S only made 4@S so Mixed won an important imp|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but all roads would lead to 4@H so - i'll defer to Vlad and Rob to examine the play|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|woozle: 11 tricks, unless he gets greedy and tries to endplay South|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|cliveo: I have to say, I find this quite remarkable. It is well outside my ability range to find this sacrifice|pg||
nt|henryb: He may be forced at the two level after doubling. I would be|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cA|nt|ahh: reasonable with no entries to try and help partner beat it |pg||
nt|phil_20686: i think a @c is what i would have led on this auction|pg||
nt|jcomyn: thats their style clive|pg||
nt|cliveo: Mind you, he still has to get the diamond and heart position correct|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cK|pg||
nt|jcomyn: oops|pg||
nt|cliveo: Now the methods have cost them. But not much, unless he gets the hearts wrong as well|pg||
pc|h2|nt|xenya: not much to examine here|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|pc|hT|pg||
nt|cliveo: In fact, we can see that the Irish pair bid to 6@c going one off, so this is going to be a bad board for Ireland whatever happens|pg||
pc|s4|nt|cliveo: you are not an advocate of fourth highest of your longest and strongest suit, then?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3 imps with 8 to play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 10 to compare|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sga1: I mean for West. He need not have bid.|pg||
pc|sA|pc|d5|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|xenya: declarer can't help making 6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and everything right for declarer|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c5|nt|ahollan1: as far as black Q location - but not in suit split - so lose a black card or let west score trump |pg||
nt|mariner1: beginning to look like 12,,,,,,,, if so Vlad buys the beer!|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: belay that -- club spots are right so no loser there|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but Cheng should play @CQ on 2nd round of the suit if holding was Q106 or Q6|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hJ|nt|phil_20686: looks normal, @s is a reasonable alternative, but like you say with no entry its not appetising. Then again, after the failure to double 3@c, perhaps a spade lead would apeal|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h9|pc|d4|pc|d2|pg||
nt|cliveo: John, you told us that Garvey and Carroll have an effective partnership even though one lives in Dublin and the other in London. I believe McGann lives in Harrogate - where does ...|pg||

nt|sga1: ok|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: well - he played it on 2nd round of the suit - but i never imagined it would be as a winner|pg||
nt|mariner1: so 11 :)|pg||

nt|cliveo: In fact the last undertrick only cost 2 IMPs because of the result in the open room|pg||
nt|jcomyn: when he isnt off playing poker somewhere|pg||
nt|vugraphzgj: Garvey is shaking his head|pg||
nt|woozle: big double-fit hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i have some descriptions of the line -- weird is one with acceptable letter count|pg||
mb|1D|nt|cliveo: In the open room, Board 5, they are playing in 3@d, so another swing to England|pg||
nt|woozle: NS make 3C or maybe 3S...EW make 11 tricks in either red suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: 2@H Micheals now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the downside of Michaels -- North doesn't know - and in fact doubts there is a @C fit|pg||
mb|1S!|nt|jcomyn: excerllent slam here|pg||
nt|henryb: double by N?|pg||
nt|mariner1: EW can make 4@H....|pg||
nt|woozle: I'm not much of a fan of this style of Michaels - I'd have no idea whether to take another bid. 1S leaves you with much better information about your partner's hand|pg||
nt|mariner1: even 5@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|cliveo: It does show that with modern technology pairs can be very effective even though they live significant travelling distances from each other|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes they do a fair bit of work on the internet - the whole teram doers|pg||
nt|cliveo: We can see the Welsh pair got a good result in the open room|pg||
nt|jcomyn: team does|pg||
nt|woozle: 2S: Anything you can cue I can cue better|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ahh: if you always made the best opening lead  you would be worlds number 1 player for sure |pg||
nt|cliveo: Their international results show that hard work pays dividends, too|pg||
nt|jcomyn: not if 6H is bid|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Italians use Ghestem -- where they would show the 2 specific suits in one bid [but don't ask me which]|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: same start in open room|pg||
nt|woozle: Going fancy could cost a bit - 4H would have probably bought it; 3D might let North back in|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|cliveo: At the moment, when Bakhshi-Forrester play in a game, Sime-Matheson play in a part score, and vice versa|pg||
nt|cliveo: With any other pair, one would say highly unlikely. But with the way Garvey and Carroll have bid so far this session, who knows?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 5s pushes them to 6H|pg||
nt|cliveo: Rees may live to regret his bid|pg||
nt|henryb: no. we seem to be in the business of rescuing the opponents when they are in trouble|pg||
nt|sga1: He preferred 2@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|sga1: :)|pg||

nt|jcomyn: unless dbl of course|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahh: this could have been sneaky 3nt on @S lead |pg||
nt|cliveo: we have a player in the north east called Bill March. If you ever find a lead other than fourth highest of your longest and strongest against 3NT you get many congratulations!|pg||
nt|ahh: but on non @S lead not so hot |pg||
nt|mariner1: I would bid a game as W|pg||
nt|ahollan1: endplayed at trick 1 :(|pg||
mb|2H|nt|jcomyn: oops again|pg||
nt|cliveo: A lot of IMPs depend on Carroll's next bid|pg||
nt|mariner1: EW have 3N here no problem.. number of tricks only issue|pg||
nt|xenya: i can see 10|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: this is not good at all|pg||
nt|cliveo: And unfortunately for Ireland, in the negative column|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mariner1: Zugzwang on the lead again :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Paul Marston would say - lead @H instead of @S -- Canape Leads - very interesting article from way back in last millenium|pg||
mb|p|nt|woozle: how could he know that his diamond honours are working... maybe there's some kind of clue|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: this a lotta imps|pg||
nt|jcomyn: TG will be shaking his head again|pg||
nt|cliveo: A club from Garvey takes the contract two off|pg||
nt|cliveo: Provided Carroll then plays a diamond to the Ace and there is a second club ruff|pg||
mb|p|nt|mariner1: only a @c continuation allows 6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: looks as thought West would have bid 2@S over 2@H or 1@S|pg||
nt|woozle: 2H over 1S might work as an asking bid - asking the opponents how many spades your partner has|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|pc|c2|nt|cliveo: Not surprisingly, he played the Ace of diamonds first. Now will he find the club?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: he better|pg||

nt|mariner1: NS have 3N if they get there|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@H bid with Qxx would have been weird|pg||
mb|1H!|nt|sharynr: will not most likely take @S and @h finesses ?|pg||
nt|cliveo: Denning/Shields will have been disappointed to have missed the slam as they are usually accurate on this type of hand|pg||
nt|henryb: wierd!|pg||
nt|sga1: I was saying for Board 7.|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahh: quite happy sniping from the side lines and helping our juniors |pg||
nt|cliveo: After all the excitement of the past boards, this looks like a routine 4@s contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzgj: they've been great hands all weekend|pg||
nt|henryb: I know|pg||
nt|sga1: ok|pg||
nt|xenya: true but might happen|pg||
mb|p!|mb|p|nt|sga1: 6@s may be bid by East in competition.|pg||
mb|p|pc|h2|nt|mariner1: time for 3N|pg||
nt|mariner1: on 16 3@S here they bid 4 @S in Open...... made 5 here|pg||
pc|h4|nt|sharynr: playing for a heart diamond squeeze would do it, yes|pg||
nt|ciaran: probably cashed out and made 12 when @HQ dropped|pg||
nt|sga1: N may have realised and passed 5@s.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: checkback?   blast 4@H |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jcomyn: true although the first half of Ireland v EBU hands were dull enough|pg||
nt|cliveo: Yes, with the exception of one session where there was a succession of part scores, there has been a lot to keep us interested|pg||
nt|vugraphzgj: I'm wearing out my alert button :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hmm or 3@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: South really doesn't want to play @H unless Opener has 4 -- so I prefer checkback if it is available|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ahh: practical shot from Ann|pg||
nt|ady: 11 tricks in hearts     spade lead will come   so no chance of a slam slipping through|pg||
nt|cliveo: Ann is consistent in her bidding style with long suits|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hope they dont get any rushes of blood to the head here|pg||
nt|cliveo: In the other matches, England are losing to Northern Ireland, whereas the England B team have a comfortable lead over Scotland|pg||
nt|xenya: S might be considering a @D conract -- well both 3N and 5@D make|pg||
nt|mariner1: BTU mixed is about to take the lead|pg||
nt|mariner1: 16 was a 9 imp swing and a new leader, still very close|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what do you think of north's 2@S bid?  i'm trying to decide if 3@H or 3@C had merits [i.e. why introduce bad 4 card suit when partner known not to hold 4@S - else negative DBL]|pg||
nt|mariner1: danger here is S is trying to talk himself out of something.........|pg||
nt|ahollan1: are either of these 'mixed' NS players female?|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ahh: opps bidding warned her off getting too high |pg||
nt|phil_20686: Slam looks awfully far away if partner cannot find a bid over 2@s, so no real danger in just bidding game|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and i meant blast 4@S|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4 of either major works|pg||
nt|mariner1: do not know|pg||
pc|h6|nt|henryb: I must confess I would not overcall 4@h. I think North's hand is far too strong|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|mariner1: has to avoid 2 @H losers|pg||
nt|xenya: N's name looks like a female one|pg||
nt|mariner1: a pair of I don't have this suit cue bids :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzgx: S: female N: Male|pg||
pc|hK|nt|jcomyn: I smell 4NT|pg||
nt|cliveo: England have had a very poor record in recent years at the Camrose and now we have the B team leading the A team!|pg||
nt|cliveo: Indeed as the scores stand at the moment, the England B team is hot on the heels of Ireland|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes but you wouldnt call the EBU weak now would you|pg||
pc|h9|nt|xenya: oh |pg||
nt|ahollan1: thanks operator!|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s2|pg||
nt|cliveo: You say that John, but interestingly Bell and byrne, for example, were not considered strong enough to play in the U28 team at Beijing, but were selected for this event|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and has to avoid losing transportation before @S established|pg||
pc|h3|nt|xenya: walking on thin ice now? |pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm intrigued by this hand -- have absolutely no idea about potential nuances|pg||
pc|hT|nt|cliveo: I am not criticising that selection, because Byrne in particular has a very impressive record with a wide variety of partners, but in our Premier League his team did not qualify ...|pg||
nt|cliveo: for the A division|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ahollan1: definitely best that East is on lead |pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ahollan1: cashing @DA doesn't hurt at all - @S makes setting up that suit easy -- @C pitch @D|pg||
nt|mariner1: well they found a spot.....|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mariner1: 17 produced 1 imp so now a 3 imp match|pg||
pc|dK|nt|phil_20686: right i will take this opportunity to get some ribena|pg||
nt|jcomyn: so there yar and they beat England in the first round|pg||
nt|mariner1: so in control now|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|sga1: absolutely. Basically a 4 loser hand only with rough LTC.|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d8|nt|cliveo: It does show how difficult a selector's job is, and I have great sympathy with them because I was once chairman of a rugby selection committee for five years, and received the odd ...|pg||
nt|cliveo: criticism myself|pg||
nt|ahollan1: among other things -- did RDBL suggest a @H stopper or just stronger hand|pg||
pc|dA|nt|henryb: but then at my table the auction would start P-1@h-1@s-2@h|pg||
nt|xenya: i would assume the latter|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: me too - so south never did show a stopper -- a puzzlement|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|c3|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ahollan1: nice try with @HQ but it won't matter|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|ahh: a junior drinking ribena  what on earth has the world come to ?|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ahollan1: i would have tried @H ruff first --- does it matter in the end?|pg||
pc|s8|pc|c7|nt|jcomyn: yes selectors are NEVER right especially in bridge asd we are all the best players in the world|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|cA|nt|xenya: perhaps S just didn't have time to show the stopper -- looks like 3@C shows shortage and 3@S completed the description of her hand |pg||
nt|ahollan1: if 2nd @D -- dummy's Q |pg||
pc|c5|pc|c4|nt|xenya: she might have had bigger ideas -- move @CK to @Ss and slam becomes sensible|pg||

nt|Walddk2: This is also dead|pg||
nt|brgpro: @sA lead?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: ace of spades? West has spade stop |pg||
nt|bjacobs: I like the ace lead here, because then you can see which card to play next.  For example, a queen to squash a jack|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That's important if you take a little spade from East and put it into West|pg||
nt|Walddk2: After all that she will lead a club :)|pg||
nt|xenya: A is best here, yes|pg||
nt|brgpro: i think that is the best believing E doesnt have KJx. |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|chessmaste: Would West double for take out with three spades?|pg||
nt|brgpro: @sQ is not as good |pg||
nt|Walddk2: But North has an entry to lead spades through|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Possibly not Mark, but surely West has @SK, so why not lead the ace just in case?  West might perhaps be 3-4-3-3,|pg||
nt|odysseus69: now it is makeable but still dont fancy as long as South ducks heart smoothly|pg||

pc|h6|pc|d9|pg||
pc|s5|nt|bjacobs: I think East needs a squeeze to go only 2 off?|pg||
nt|brgpro: note the way she cashes her @s, from up down, she is trying to show interest in @h|pg||
nt|brgpro: many players ignor that|pg||
pc|h4|nt|bjacobs: She has to pitch a top diamond from hand - then two rounds of diamonds squeezes South.  Very unusual|pg||
pc|d6|nt|odysseus69: you are right again Roland - the heart duck was smooth- but the lead and the earlier pass of 2D led me to underestimate South|pg||

nt|jcomyn: Hughe is not as green as he is cabbage-looking I assure you|pg||
nt|cliveo: We were discussing this during another match yesterday, and the conclusion was that the consistency of the Irish selection has a lot to do with its success|pg||
nt|jcomyn: ah part score at last|pg||
nt|vugraphzgj: East aplologising for not bidding six!|pg||
nt|henryb: as well he should|pg||

nt|ahollan1: the very best NS can hope for is a push|pg||
mb|2S|nt|cliveo: a teetotal scottish junior? whatever next!|pg||
nt|ady: not much difficulty here|pg||
nt|phil_20686: i think 5N will come out of the box here|pg||
nt|cliveo: yes, it would be a major surprise if they don't play in 6NT|pg||
mb|d!|nt|jcomyn: not selected Clive - they murdered the winners of our prelim trials in the final trial|pg||
nt|henryb: 6@h cold from N chair|pg||
mb|p|nt|cliveo: If the Welsh pair outbid the Irish on this board in the open room, it is difficult to believe Garvey and Carroll will be outbid!|pg||
nt|cliveo: whatever the methods are, the same team has played for some time|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes five years now|pg||
nt|sga1: Now we see 5@c again with a good hand.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but lose 12 much more likely|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|mariner1: can NS make 4@S here?|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, but somehoww not too likely|pg||
nt|xenya: the push i meant|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: I dont think west should be encouraging a grand slam with that shape    likely to be at least a vital queen or king missing|pg||
nt|cliveo: I know top players don't like to use blackwood, but anyone who reached a grand on this hand needs to revisit their bidding system|pg||
nt|ady: they wont play lower than 6NT  thats for sure|pg||
nt|cliveo: your B team seemed to perform creditably in the last two Camroses, so it isn't as if you have no other good players|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil_20686: I think it depends largely on partners shape, if he has a 5 card suit grand rates to be fairly good I think, at any rate, with a poor min east is not accepting|pg||
nt|sga1: What these guys r bidding?|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@S is not likely either|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: true we have some verfy good players down the line, |pg||
nt|cliveo: Goodness me! Garvey-Carroll outbid on a part score!|pg||
pc|cT|nt|cliveo: I have to say, it seems odd to me when you have such a strong team, that you have trials|pg||
nt|henryb: They play in a different world from that you and I inhabit|pg||
nt|mariner1: I agree on last hand Al, 4@S much safer spot..... NMF or checkback would have|pg||
nt|mariner1: worked|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2N - showing the @D stopper :)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|jcomyn: not really clive Hanlon and McGann outbid|pg||
nt|vugraphzgx: Sorry for the connection problem.|pg||
nt|sybarra: nothing you can do :(|pg||
pc|cK|nt|phil_20686: Bakshi agrees with Edwin - that is good enough for me :)|pg||
nt|ahh: its more basic than that Phil if he doesnt have all the bullets  grand is poor |pg||
nt|sharynr: if he knows all the cards like we do, he can do the strip and endplay because of the doubleton diamond K|pg||
nt|ciaran: i guess if the previous hand - KT9xxx xxxx xx x or so was a 2S, this is a 1S :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: anyway Tom is playing it and he is even less green if a little more cabbage-looking - no he is not Annie don't worry|pg||
nt|mariner1: on 19 S opened 3@D and it went SWISH in open :)|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|phil_20686: yes, but he didnt try to investigate with a combined 35-37 count|pg||
nt|ahh: if he has all the bullets theres a hole somewhere else |pg||
nt|vugraphzgj: play did not take long !|pg||
nt|cliveo: an interesting sequence. Let's say Forrester held something like A@s A@h Axxxx@d and AK@c, then 7NT would be a spread|pg||
nt|jcomyn: just joking|pg||
nt|jcomyn: he didnt go down did he?|pg||
nt|ciaran: Maybe bidding 4H is a bit pushy when partner could not act over 1S? |pg||
nt|sharynr: apparently he did|pg||
nt|vugraphzgj: official score sheet reads -1|pg||
nt|ciaran: Seems normal to go one off misguessing hearts|pg||
nt|jcomyn: 9-what Ciaran|pg||
nt|ciaran: :) maybe Tom hasn't read that book|pg||
nt|jcomyn: there we go teaching beginners and Tom ignores us|pg||
nt|cliveo: I think other players should have to demonstrate they have the ability to outperform the current team at this level|pg||
nt|cliveo: Though I know a lot of people disagree with me on selection methods|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well the players at home want trials and after all it means a 96-board practice before the camrose|pg||
nt|sga1: i believe so looking at their bidding.|pg||

pc|c3|pc|c6|nt|woozle: 2H herebeatable, but not on a diamond lead|pg||

nt|bjacobs: It's still rather messy for declarer.  Vic was right ... it is interesting|pg||
nt|brgpro: Sun is a very careful declarer|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What about aces, kings, queens and jacks? I never get them when I play rubber bridge|pg||
nt|brgpro: really?? then pls tell me where and when do u ever play rubber....i want to play AGAINST u roland|pg||
nt|bjacobs: You'll probably cut him as partner|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Very unfair when you always start with an extra Jack:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good one|pg||

nt|jcomyn: are be baloobad again|pg||
nt|sharynr: perhaps, sounds good to me :)|pg||
nt|jcomyn: or is it balubad|pg||
nt|vugraphzgj: fixed problem - back in 5|pg||
nt|ciaran: South openen 1N and is playing there in the open room, so a chance for e/w if they reach 2@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: never mind -- transportation issue only if West had ducked that @D|pg||
mb|1N|nt|cliveo: Another potential slam hand!|pg||
nt|sga1: 4@s for NS.|pg||
nt|santyclz: A lot of cards onside for a change.|pg||
nt|mariner1: only part scores here.|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4@H makes 3n makes|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahh: D  then break 4-1   bad luck |pg||
nt|ahollan1: used winners to pull a round of trump while maintaining control -- good play|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|cliveo: But they will do well to bid it with only a combined 20 count|pg||
nt|jcomyn: anyone for 1S on S hand - not me|pg||
nt|cliveo: routine for this pair, surely?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes lol|pg||
nt|cliveo: without the intervention Garvey-Carroll have methods to distinguish between voids and singletons; I don't know if the double changes that, but probably not|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H!|nt|jcomyn: dangerous interference now|pg||
nt|cliveo: 3NT would have shown a void without the double, probably still does|pg||
nt|ahollan1: over 2/1 game force, should 3@H show solid suit and/or extra high cards?|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil_20686: grand only needs to be 57% to be a winning proposition, if you are sure your opposition will be in at least small slam, as here|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil_20686: the magic of imps :)|pg||
nt|cliveo: assuming they are playing 20-22 you could throw in j@d and a Q and still have all the other cards I mentioned|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes it does|pg||
nt|cliveo: I think Garvey will be very interested in moving forward now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i believe moscito uses 1@C as 15+ in 1st/2nd seat but 16+ in 3rd/4th -- but i won't swear to that|pg||
nt|mariner1: NS staying out properly here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the point is -- 1@S is limited by failure to open 1@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i know my vote - what say Vlad and Rob?|pg||
nt|mariner1: this|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|sybarra: the Save?|pg||
nt|mariner1: and I don't like 3@H no matter what it shows :)|pg||
nt|xenya: previous hand -- if W had refused to ruff the @CA, the contract would have been beaten?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i agree - shows self sufficient suit|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, i agree Al|pg||
nt|ahollan1: too right Vlad -- force declarer to pitch winner and the she has to ruff next trick|pg||
nt|mariner1: 19 was a double set swing and 5 more imps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: presumably 4@D is cue-bid, just coincidence that he has length -- and south knows off at least @SA|pg||
nt|mariner1: 20 may see us with a new leader though|pg||
nt|xenya: still match is very close|pg||
mb|p|nt|cliveo: Wrong again . He knows Carrolls opening style though|pg||
nt|jcomyn: well s have to be 2-2 and when does that happen these days|pg||
nt|sybarra: will not be cheap |pg||
nt|santyclz: A lot of cards offside in the save.|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes|pg||
nt|sybarra: too many |pg||
nt|woozle: sorry folks, back after my internet dropped out|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ugly hand to lead from|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: 3 to the Q offside and bingo|pg||
nt|cliveo: A lot, yesterday!|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome back, S made the 4 @H's when we all dropped out |pg||
pc|hA|nt|mariner1: yes and @c makes the contract easy......|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ahh: Phil will not know what a redouble card looks like  for the good of the junior captains blood pressure we take them out of the bidding box |pg||
nt|cliveo: Does everyone agree with Bakhshi's redouble?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: do you want to be in it though?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: I suppose all slams that make are good slams|pg||
nt|cliveo: As the late John Collings said, any slam that makes is a good one|pg||
nt|cliveo: Glad we agree :)|pg||
nt|henryb: be back in a moment. Coffee time|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now 4@H and a disciplined pass by north gets cheers from all|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well done!|pg||
nt|xenya: nicely done|pg||
pc|h2|nt|woozle: South showing poor technique leading the top of a doubleton trump|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hJ|pc|hQ|nt|mariner1: well on 20 NS bid all the way to 2@S....... which will score imps but not enough|pg||
nt|xenya: a @D lead might have been awkward for declarer|pg||
nt|mariner1: that in Open|pg||
nt|ahollan1: natsuki - claim early, claim often [before anything goes wrong :) ]|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|mariner1: I am assuming they make 2@S though|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ahh: yes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with doubleton trump, i would have tried @D instead of @C -- but leading from Jack is usually bad too|pg||
pc|h7|pc|s5|nt|woozle: making six now, with two diamonds pitched on clubs|pg||
nt|sybarra: can not make 6 |pg||
nt|sybarra: *now|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|s8|nt|cliveo: This sort of hand is why bridge is not a good spectator sport|pg||
pc|s6|nt|cliveo: Obviously Phil can't answer this question :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @SK to preserve entry to dummy -- another fine play|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
nt|phil_20686: depends on their agreements i would probably just have bid 1@s|pg||
nt|cliveo: We can all see that the contract is very easy to make whereas Garvey does not know the layout of the cards|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sK|pc|c5|nt|ahollan1: either odd-even or upside-down attitude -- but @H3 sure looks like "i like @H"|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|cK|nt|jcomyn: he does now|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|nt|cliveo: Perhaps Roland should work towards having edited highlights, match of the day style!|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|cliveo: how should they find the heart fit then?|pg||

pc|h2|nt|chessmaste: This could be a lot of if declarer goes 'All in'|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like only 8 tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: or more, Mark, true|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Might be only four|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Right win the heart eventually, spade to the ace, diamond finesse.   Finally, look for somewhere to hide|pg||
nt|brgpro: even if S doesnt switch to a @s in time, E has only 8 tricks. however, with @s switch he will go a lot down|pg||
nt|chessmaste: South must unblock a spade|pg||
nt|brgpro: although it is 50 a piece....|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hK|pc|h4|pg||

nt|brgpro: i think S shd switch to a @s after the 2nd @h....looking at @sA in dummy|pg||
nt|brgpro: pd cant have a quick entry|pg||
nt|brgpro: as PO suggested, declarer might have 7 @d|pg||
nt|bjacobs: He's playing with 200 points.  Going for the game yields only an extra 250 points.  It's not clearcut whether to concede or go for it|pg||

nt|jcomyn: but much of the entertainment is watching the score hand after hand|pg||
nt|santyclz: The @h guess wasn't too tough.|pg||
nt|sybarra: and 12 imps to n/s on bd 20 |pg||
nt|woozle: Now, 4S maybe making overtricks...a useless board for the trailing team|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good claim :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahh: Bakshi hand from last board has rotated 90 degrees |pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: this is like a rugby match that has a stream of scrums in the middle of the field with nothing happening|pg||
nt|cliveo: this looks like a routine 4@h contract but with the fun and games we've had at this table, who knows|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: i wonder if Zia would have played @S10 at trick 1|pg||
nt|mariner1: this is the penultimate board of the match........... score still very close|pg||
mb|2D|nt|cliveo: Although as we can see, 4@s is a good save|pg||
nt|jcomyn: lets all bid each others suits|pg||
nt|cliveo: Carroll has opened another hand that most people would pass|pg||
nt|cliveo: And presumably Garvey has made some sort of game force in @h|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes but saving can be very dangerous when opps dont agree|pg||
nt|mariner1: 3@D would be my call......|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that sure would have slowed down the play|pg||
mb|2S|nt|phil_20686: your hearts don't look good with the hearts on your right, i would rather have AJxx or similar, a true finesse, conversly, your spades have improved, and your hand isnt really good ...|pg||
nt|phil_20686: enough to penalise at the one level - you don;t want to discourage the opposition from competing to 3@H - I would know what to do to that|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't understand East's DBL either|pg||
nt|mariner1: W certainly should think it shows something in a major|pg||
nt|mariner1: this is the penultimate board of this session........ next session in 30 minutes|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahh: all the girls love Tony |pg||
nt|cliveo: A distinguished kibitzer has pointed out that 4@s is not good on a @s lead|pg||
nt|cliveo: Do we know what 3@d means?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgj: no|pg||
nt|mariner1: be sure to check the vugraph schedule, lot of good one there -|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://online.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php - BBO Vugraph Schedule (set|pg||
nt|mariner1: up to show times for your area)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what system/convention has East bid 2@D?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahh: he always has lots of @D|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H  likely spot    will fail to bad trump split|pg||
nt|ady: re-doubled showing 3 hearts|pg||
nt|ahh: xx = 3 @H ?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: usuall extras whoich he dont have|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sick == this will actually work|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seeing dummy makes @H shift easy|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ahh: too quick for me David |pg||
nt|xenya: EW can make 5@C here |pg||
nt|mariner1: 2@D must show @c and @S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: top & bottom?|pg||
nt|xenya: but unlikely to bid it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: top & another??|pg||
pc|d4|nt|jcomyn: I think this may well be bid nowe that Tommy thinks hand is better than it is|pg||
nt|cliveo: I see obviously not a minimum 1@h opener!|pg||
nt|jcomyn: and TG will think his CK is well placed|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mariner1: yes when I saw the DBL did not occur to me it was penalty :)|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|jcomyn: oh well thats it|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice @CA - now @D finesse|pg||
pc|dT|nt|xenya: still a 6-imp swing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i haven't seen either of those treatments in a long time|pg||
pc|dK|nt|cliveo: No, he is well attuned to the Carroll opening style|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or not :)|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ady: dont like the spade bid with 3 small  and 4 clubs to the ace|pg||
nt|ady: unusual with my typing|pg||
nt|jcomyn: you have obviously been watching this pair closely|pg||
nt|cliveo: You've been giving me a good inside line on their style!|pg||
nt|mariner1: we have a close match again...... 4 imps|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|ahh: i like this  10 bds in   5 flat boards    best scottish performance for ages |pg||
nt|phil_20686: i don't think norths double here is all that clear, perhaps they are nervoud about getting bullied out of the auction as happened to their team mates against the irish.|pg||
nt|cliveo: reverting to our theme on board 10, it is unlikely Bakhshi will expect N to hold 4@h|pg||
nt|ahh: i think its a clear double by passed hand |pg||
nt|cliveo: I don't disagree|pg||
nt|phil_20686: (and may encourage partner to sac whn its wrong) - would like to see north have more shape and not not Txxx as one of her two suits|pg||
nt|ahh: no sacrificing at  green all   by 2 passed hands |pg||
nt|cliveo: the point is, that with competitive bidding being much more aggressive these days, you don't have to assume that just because someone doubles the suits break badly with the length ...|pg||
nt|cliveo: inthe opposite hand|pg||
nt|phil_20686: you don't sac over game only jim, could easil sac in 2s-1 against 2h-1 with the north hand|pg||
nt|ahh: in Aberden if someone makes a take out double it just about guareentees length in the suit opened|pg||
nt|phil_20686: i think he will now, no one is leading a doubleton diamond on this auction surely|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but this 2 imps to BTU-cheng|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|nt|cliveo: Let's hope the scrums end shortly and we move back to some open play!|pg||
pc|sK|nt|henryb: this has few chances, but remembering the 3@c contract ...|pg||
nt|sga1: Actually it will make.|pg||
nt|mariner1: 4 boards to be score however none look like big swings|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good @S exit|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h4|nt|ahollan1: closed room coming to the misplayed vul 5@D hand now|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: @S10 may/should have suit preference overtones - confirming @H|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|sga1: Now home.|pg||
nt|sga1: Sry No.|pg||
nt|henryb: really? loks like 2@s, 1@h, 1@d and one @c to lose|pg||
nt|sga1: He has to finesse @h now.|pg||
nt|henryb: and only eight winners|pg||
pc|s4|nt|phil_20686: this does not look to be a great switch|pg||
nt|ahh: not the best time for a trump switch sadly |pg||
nt|ady: play ace and another    still no chance|pg||
nt|ady: trump switch ok   |pg||
nt|ahh: even ducking is ok |pg||
nt|ady: yes|pg||
nt|ahh: then can overruff   and play 2 more |pg||
nt|cliveo: although it might not cost giving the contract to Forrester, it seems a really strange switch when partner is known to hold hearts, and if there is a tenace position you are ...|pg||
nt|cliveo: risking giving a trick away|pg||
nt|phil_20686: still a diamond, or a spade return, would lead rather less riskily to -1|pg||
nt|phil_20686: swap the K and A of hearts, and you have just let through the contract by letting him ditch his spade honours on the top clubs|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: 2nd chance to take @D finesse rejected -- i guess declarer ok with @H suit being frozen|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
mc|9|nt|phil_20686: spade losers that is|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes I said earlier they were only in 2@S there|pg||

nt|chessmaste: One down is good bridge - who said that? :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: on the bidding|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I don't know, but it sure applied here|pg||

nt|brgpro: not me Mark! i hate to go down...|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|2C|nt|chessmaste: You must be used to it by now:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Par result here is 6@CX down 2|pg||
nt|brgpro: another swing hand...NS can make 5@s and EW can save in 6@c for 300 and 500 in 6@h|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|5C|nt|odysseus69: 6C cheap but can they get near it|pg||
mb|d|nt|bjacobs: Maybe even 800 in 6@H|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 5@C even cheaper|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h2|pc|hT|pc|hA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not sure double is the correct action with 5-card spade support, but it's often difficult to judge at this level|pg||
nt|odysseus69: that double was again not on my short list - this time no prize|pg||
nt|brgpro: first, i think S has too much for a pre-e. like mixed raise...|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c4|pc|c5|pc|c8|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|c7|pc|d3|pg||
nt|brgpro: 2nd, with Axx in @c...there is not too much wasted value...so better pass and let pd decide|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sQ|pc|sK|pc|sT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Identical auction in the closed room|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Really?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: really|pg||
nt|brgpro: however, once she underbid her hand the first time, she was afraid that her pass now might not be forcing, so she had to X to show extras|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The 3@S bid is surely wrong.  I guess once you've done it, the double becomes indicated|pg||
nt|brgpro: i would bid 2NT here as a good raise but not sure if they play the same way|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Or cue-bid to show the raise, if you're old fashioned like me|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Any danger North will not cash out?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: it never occurred to me that 3S was pre-emptive - it looked like a conservative limit raise|pg||
nt|bjacobs: In that case, the focus is definitely back on the double.  Let's just say that ONE of the bids was poorly judged|pg||
nt|brgpro: well, it could be a mixed raise , can be done without either @dK or Q|pg||
nt|xenya: N doesn't know which singleton E has|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Still a danger looming here|pg||
pc|d9|nt|chessmaste: N/S bid game voluntarily - that is usually a FP situation|pg||
pc|d4|nt|xenya: @S or @D|pg||
nt|brgpro: red against white, even a pre-e cant be very light|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d5|pg||

nt|mariner1: lovers worldwide!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S?  ouch -- freud must have prevented me from seeing that |pg||
nt|mariner1: 2 @S made and cheng takes the lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: South  lots of hearts again|pg||
nt|jcomyn: good lord|pg||
nt|henryb: N-S likely to reach 3N|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ahh: pity Ann is in 4th  we could lay bets on 3 4 5 @H openers otherwise |pg||
mb|2C|nt|sybarra: thx to our terrific operator,  great job! |pg||
nt|vugraphzgx: thanks all|pg||
nt|woozle: EW did their job in the other room, grabbing their four tricks, so the best EW can hope to do is tie that|pg||
nt|santyclz: Thanks, Shirley, Kieran.|pg||
nt|sybarra: Thanks to Keiran and Joe,  for guiding us thru these hands |pg||
nt|woozle: thanks all|pg||

nt|mariner1: much fun Al, we will be back together here in 24 minutes or so...........|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ahh: now is 4@H splinter ?|pg||
nt|woozle: did the other table lead a club blind - good job!|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: got a felling this will be 4@H X|pg||
nt|henryb: and could go down on a @c lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: and thx to the organizers for bringing this terrific tournament to bbo |pg||
nt|santyclz: Bad hand for rev bergen.|pg||
nt|sybarra: back in just over 1/2 hour |pg||
nt|santyclz: I will desert you for that, I'm afraid.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: always a blast Rob|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|nt|phil_20686: well that will be unfortunate for the defence|pg||
nt|ciaran: looks like e/w sold out to 1N here on 11 - understandable|pg||
nt|sga1: Yes 3N likely contract.|pg||
mb|d|nt|phil_20686: time for the blue card with 9 hearts Jim?|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am deserting also for that one,  I am traveling tomorrow|pg||
nt|mariner1: Roland has been very busy and we have some excellent vugraphs coming up so|pg||
nt|mariner1: be sure and check the schedule.............|pg||
nt|mariner1: http://online.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php - BBO Vugraph Schedule (set|pg||
nt|mariner1: up to show times for your area)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: are there options to 4@H?   phew - nope|pg||
nt|mariner1: the do not want to DBL 4 @H|pg||
nt|mariner1: they|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i was just thinking that is strong possibility|pg||
nt|ahollan1: any guesses about 2N?|pg||
nt|mariner1: we have a 3 imp match with 3 boards to score|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahh: are you confident with your favourite partner  you both play it the same way ?|pg||
nt|jcomyn: not the ideal time for funnies|pg||
nt|cliveo: that swing seemed to come from nowhere. it shows how much harder it is to play a hand single dummy|pg||
nt|cliveo: they always look much simpler to play when you can see all four hands!|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahh: no xx they might run |pg||
nt|phil_20686: xx after i have rebid my suit at the 4 level, yes, im confident they will not run :)|pg||
nt|ciaran: McGann likes lead directing third hand openings. |pg||
nt|jcomyn: wish I could agree|pg||
nt|santyclz: Oh well.|pg||
nt|sybarra: why are we not surprised that THIS table is also in 4 @H's|pg||
mb|p|pc|h7|nt|sga1: Must play small @c|pg||
nt|henryb: or duck @cK|pg||
nt|mariner1: a big THANKS! to Unknown (Taipei), our superb operator, for doing an excellent|pg||
nt|mariner1: job!!!|pg||
pc|hK|nt|sga1: Like @c 9|pg||
nt|ahollan1: bddream saves meconin :)|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ahh: even Homer nods |pg||
nt|mariner1: so you sensed the DBL too :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: absolutely -- but sure wish i had studied up on Moscito before the session|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|ady: you dont know you are making 4@H anyway    spade bis from partner dont make your hand better|pg||
nt|phil_20686: true|pg||
nt|ahh: @Sheila will say  better Dummy this time |pg||
nt|phil_20686: i wasnt seriously suggesting it :)|pg||
nt|ahh: Sheila |pg||
nt|cliveo: Ann can make an overtrick now if she goes up with K@h and plays the K@s - bit double-dummyish though|pg||
nt|ahh: you see why we remove junior redouble cards now ?|pg||
nt|phil_20686: got to preserve the two for your overtrick|pg||
nt|phil_20686: 2@h that is|pg||
nt|by: E thinking about a redouble|pg||
nt|mariner1: hi BY|pg||
nt|ahollan1: indeed - great job operator!|pg||
nt|mariner1: ALL the Taipei Operators have been EXCELLENT!|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ady: yes    4H entry|pg||
nt|cliveo: It looks as if Rees should make this for another 5 IMPs to Wales|pg||
nt|cliveo: They are building up a significant lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well - there goes the @H trick|pg||
nt|mariner1: @c lead helps a little here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: except West can't get back to hand|pg||
nt|mariner1: so maybe we will see a swing|pg||
nt|mariner1: S needs to ruff an assumed @D back and underlead @H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no - i think defense still prevails|pg||
nt|mariner1: Many thanks to the NTU Cup folks with Jarron Shih being instrumental, and all the|pg||
nt|mariner1: student organizers for helping BBO bring us the vugraphs......|pg||
nt|xenya: EW  have 12 tricks here but can't quite take them|pg||

pc|c4|pg||
nt|by: declarer sneaks a trump off dummy :P|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes defense still can prevail|pg||

pc|c7|nt|cliveo: well done!|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|mariner1: now under lead @H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: don't like @H8 -- @HQ is so much clearer message|pg||
nt|mariner1: yes agreed put the Q@H on table|pg||
nt|mariner1: not like you are wasting a trick|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but still @HAK|pg||
nt|mariner1: I mean playing Q@H does not waste a @H trick,,,,,,, so 8 was not well thought out|pg||
pc|s8|nt|jcomyn: this is far from a vintage Irish display I have to say|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now Rob has me thinking -- maybe i could be from another country - i hear good things about New Zealand, except they have winter -- oh well|pg||
nt|mariner1: Al does our Gov't know you are here? :)|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ahh: classy |pg||
nt|xenya: oh dear|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sharynr: no drury i presume|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|nt|ahollan1: the ONLY thing i can think of -- @H8 playing odd-even implies some @D holding|pg||
nt|xenya: any passive lead beats it|pg||
nt|vugraphzgx: This is the end of the broadcast.|pg||
nt|mariner1: congrats to Cheng on what looks like a win now......... NTU Cup 2009 winners!|pg||
nt|vugraphzgx: Thanks every body.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that must be the end of it -- WOW|pg||
nt|mariner1: bye all!|pg||
pc|d2|nt|jcomyn: maybe John's new baby is keeping him awake at night|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|ciaran: Not sure - looking for their notes|pg||
nt|mariner1: well he certainly should not be pround of that @D holding|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but that is a huge reach  --  @HQ clearly says - i've got @H sequence and nothing else to brag about|pg||
nt|mariner1: learning signal takes a lot of play though...........|pg||
pc|d3|nt|jcomyn: I think they are well used to light 3rd in hand openings|pg||
nt|jcomyn: -1|pg||
nt|ciaran: 7 top tricks for declarer since south had to follow to clubs but that looks to be it |pg||
pc|c2|pc|dQ|nt|santyclz: 5/5 opposite a limit raise, hope and don't tell the opps how to defend.|pg||
nt|vugraphzgx: This is the end of the semi-final.|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx again all,  cu in about 1/2 hours|pg||

nt|henryb: fortunate result|pg||

mb|p|nt|henryb: E-W can make 4@s but not easy to bid|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|jcomyn: Tom is thinking up some divilment|pg||
nt|sharynr: a 3@D bid might have shut the opps out of the auction|pg||
nt|henryb: Stayman here would be useful|pg||
mb|1H|nt|sharynr: but i suppose he does not want to give up on an eventual 3NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|ahh: right Phil tell me the score for 4@H xx +1  vul |pg||
nt|henryb: but will he raise 2@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil_20686: 1190?|pg||
nt|cliveo: before you arrived, Jim, we were discussing the relative selection processes of the countries. The only country that seems to put out the same team, and their best team every year, ...|pg||
nt|cliveo: wins it time after time after time. Whereas each year both England and Scotland seem to have a totally different team. Does this mean that England and Scotland don't take the ...|pg||
nt|cliveo: competition as seriously as the Republic of Ireland?|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|ciaran: interesting hand - 4S is an ok spot but no good on this layout|pg||
nt|cliveo: As you can see, the Irish pair made 3NT in the other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: daresay he has to bid it|pg||
nt|cliveo: And yet Garvey could have let them play in 2@d|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|sharynr: and 4@d will make as well|pg||
nt|jcomyn: lucky|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzgj: I'm not sure if the 2 tables are connected but don't want to shut down as last time I tried that we lost the connection|pg||
nt|henryb: to 4 no less|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ahh: no i think so far as Scotland is concerned  we have a very small pool of talent |pg||
nt|jcomyn: and copper time|pg||
nt|cliveo: for the second time in this set, EW with 24 points have virtually been shut out from the auction|pg||
nt|henryb: well done|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: chopper|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ciaran: the lack of entries to south means that the clubs can't be picked up.  (assuming no early ruff for E)|pg||
nt|cliveo: Some welcome points back for the Irish team|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: well I wouldnt pass 2D with the W hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|cliveo: but therefore you would expect much more consistency in the selection process|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: Club switch demanded|pg||
nt|sharynr: having doubled 3@S i dont see why he has to bid at all, when his partner did not cooperate|pg||
nt|ciaran: Hugh looking for an early ruff  - leading suit preference 2|pg||
pc|sA|nt|cliveo: What it does demonstrate is that if a pair plays a very aggressive style against you, your methods are put to the test|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ahh: and we hold pair trials  which encourages different pairings  getting in the team |pg||
nt|ady: england in 4@H  not doubled board 12|pg||
nt|cliveo: yes, I know some people violently disagree with me, but I think this process is seriously flawed|pg||
nt|henryb: I think 4@s could be beaten if N ducks the first @s|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jcomyn: Tom u mean or is it|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|ciaran: yes - Tom!|pg||
nt|cliveo: I am sure that Rees-Kurbalija will look at some of these hands and work out that they need to revisit their actions against very aggressive opponents|pg||
nt|jcomyn: but Filip bid a vul, 2D he has hardly done that on a 9-count|pg||
nt|cliveo: How do you think the auction should have proceeded then, John?|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s9|nt|ahh: our obvious strongest teams  have been tried with  poor results |pg||
pc|s5|nt|ahh: take Pau for example |pg||

pc|dK|pc|d3|pc|d4|pc|d2|pg||
nt|ciaran: still just one off provided declarer is careful|pg||
nt|sharynr: he will still need to take the @h finesse as the clubs are blocked|pg||
nt|vugraphzgj: director called revoke|pg||
nt|sharynr: and the heart finesse must come first|pg||
nt|ciaran: yes - can just get to dummy once|pg||
nt|jcomyn: what revoke?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgj: McGann revoked|pg||
nt|sharynr: who revoked? maybe this will make after all :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzgj: on @S|pg||
nt|jcomyn: how could he he had only one|pg||
nt|sharynr: maybe he played it on the second round|pg||
nt|ciaran: Very low scoring segment so far - particularly compared to last night and this morning's first 16 boards|pg||
nt|jcomyn: no on the 4th round|pg||
nt|jcomyn: on the SAce|pg||
nt|sharynr: sorry folks, have to leave you now. enjoy the rest of the match |pg||
nt|jcomyn: bye Sharyn|pg||
nt|ciaran: Bye Sharyn|pg||
nt|jcomyn: he couldnt revoke Ciaran he played s on Ace|pg||
nt|ciaran: If he were playing BBO, he couldn't!|pg||
nt|vugraphzgj: I will put result in when finished|pg||
nt|jcomyn: of course we assumed he played it on Ace and maybe operator did as well|pg||

nt|ciaran: Lucky escape for Ireland then - looked like it would be just one off, so the revoke did not cost much|pg||
nt|cliveo: interesting, it might suggest that McGann Hanlon have done a little more work in this area|pg||
nt|cliveo: but Rees and Kurbalija are a fine partnership and I'm sure they will look at their methods closely|pg||
nt|jcomyn: no W bid 2NT and E 3|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahh: so  no harm in blooding new pairs but give them a chance  dont chop and change too often |pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|henryb: We cannot complain about the "boring" hands in this session|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcomyn: the we-never-pass pair|pg||
nt|cliveo: In the open room, Denning found a bid where Carroll has passed|pg||
nt|cliveo: And Shields bid 4@s which ended the auction|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|cliveo: a kibbitzer has suggested Ireland only has 6 players but their B team performed very creditably int he last two Camrose matches, and if my memory serves me correctly beat our ...|pg||
nt|cliveo: England A team in a critical match last year|pg||
nt|ady: 2nd double|pg||
nt|phil_20686: Its self fulfilling clive, if you send the same 6 players to every tournament, then they will be vastly more expereinced than anyone else|pg||
nt|ady: pass brings in the points|pg||
nt|ahh: the harsh truth is that our top pairs dont work hard enough on their games |pg||
mb|3N|nt|cliveo: The way this auction has progressed, one would expect the Welsh pair to bid 4@h and if the Irish pair bid 4@s one would expect them to be doubled|pg||
nt|cliveo: But my predictions have been wrong before, of course|pg||
nt|jcomyn: yes but here I think nobody knows who has what at this stage|pg||
nt|cliveo: however, Rees and Kurbalija have a much more conservative style than Garvey and Carroll, so I would expect them to believe they have some defence|pg||
mb|p|nt|phil_20686: this is the kind of auction that might demonstrate your point|pg||
nt|phil_20686: all top class players should real 2@s as natural, nearly all club players would try 2NT at this point|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|phil_20686: I rest my case :)|pg||
nt|ciaran: Looks like a straightforward 4H - off if N/S find the @C ruff|pg||
pc|c2|nt|henryb: down one is a respectable result|pg||
nt|henryb: and is available|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ady: well a plus score|pg||
nt|ahh: now i accept we dont have professional players in Scotland   but from the safety and comfort of your home  we can play practise matches against the very best in the world these ...|pg||
nt|ahh: days |pg||
nt|jcomyn: they will unless H disdains the finesse|pg||
pc|c9|nt|ciaran: Even if he does, N has three trumps|pg||
nt|jcomyn: not this time|pg||
nt|jcomyn: hope he doeasnt lead a s|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|cliveo: Mind you, the way the bidding has proceeded, Kurbalija may well go off in 4@H. It looks like he needs the @s finesse, and on the bidding he may expect Garvey to hold the K@s!|pg||
nt|cliveo: At least we will know on trick 1 whether he is likely to make or not|pg||
nt|henryb: perhaps. N-S are cold for 4@h|pg||
pc|d8|nt|jcomyn: and hope C are right|pg||
pc|d3|nt|phil_20686: it wont be long now before its all change at the top in scotland|pg||
