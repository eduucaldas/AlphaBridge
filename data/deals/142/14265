nt|niclecuyer: sometimes overcalling on nothing leads to nothing results|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|3C|nt|flash: Q showing/asking for drop of Jack; else count...|pg||
nt|starkist: can i quote you nic?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: kibitzer suggesting michaels, that looks even sicker to me|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: yes even when I do it :)|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: 2Sp would do ok with me|pg||
nt|starkist: particularly|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: with the suit quality but having the quarter they are having, I don't know about it|pg||
nt|flash: Nick can't be sure that the @HJ wouldn't be declarer's 9th trick (or that Judith has the @C suit under control)|pg||
mb|p|nt|niclecuyer: oh oh|pg||
nt|starkist: not down yet|pg||
nt|flash: still ok, no matter how scary...|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|starkist: up and back|pg||
nt|flash: declarer has 5 @Ss, 2 @Ds and 1 @C...|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|h2|pc|h3|nt|fabsayc: yikes|pg||
nt|flash: now he can make|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: this is getting interesting|pg||
nt|flash: run the @Ss and watch the defenders squirm...|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: some hands can be such a puzzle to defend|pg||
nt|starkist: decl will squirm too|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: yep |pg||
nt|flash: or just guess the @D position??|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes is that feasible|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: he can come to the spade A and try a low diamond |pg||
nt|czyzyk: He has to play for @d Axx. No way to make it otherwise|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||
pc|cK|nt|fabsayc: but it essentially assumes a mistake|pg||
pc|c8|nt|caitlin: I like that Jurek|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: that won'T do it|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: the club play :)|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|pg||
pc|c6|nt|fabsayc: this is a zero line :)|pg||
nt|caitlin: we teach novices/intermediates to put cards where you need them to be to make the contract|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cQ|nt|caitlin: true for all level of players|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|niclecuyer: strange |pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|flash: again, hard to visualize a @C position where that would gain...  |pg||
nt|starkist: knew he was down by playing clubs akq and a known|pg||
pc|d4|pg||

mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|lml: hi|pg||
nt|lml: and welcome back|pg||
mb|1N|nt|vugraphzjq: Both of these teams have won this event before|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: Gartaganis a couple times, and from Korbel's team, Wolpert and Balcombe have won it|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D!|an|Xfer to H|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|lml: 2@D is an intersting bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: it is going to work out fine|pg||
nt|lml: 8 tricks should not be too tough|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: probably 9|pg||
nt|flash: 3@H = 4-card support and a minimum|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d5|nt|lml: and with trumps breaking we are good|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d7|pg||
nt|flash: i'm not sure i understand not cashing the @C, but...   1 IMP it will be|pg||
mc|10|nt|mcphee: jc did not even make an attemtp to bid 7|pg||
pg||

nt|flash: a natural weak 2???    is that legal in this event???|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|niclecuyer: right :) forgot was heart Q not K|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|fabsayc: you have to provide a written defense but yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|niclecuyer: they have to prealert it :)|pg||
nt|flash: if Nick plays the 2@D opener for dreck, he can take a lot of tricks...|pg||
nt|caitlin: nv 2@D|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4N|nt|fabsayc: time for the gatorade supplement|pg||
nt|flash: taking out insurance vs the dreaded 5-card weak 2...|pg||

mb|p|nt|lml: thanks for the info|pg||
nt|lml: this is a poor preempt id diamonds|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|lml: at this vulnerability the 3 level seems reasonable with a bit of shape|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|lml: if left alone north south would likely have ended in 4@S|pg||
nt|mcphee: easy to reach 7 on this one|pg||
nt|flash: 4NT with a void in the other room?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: and that  would probable have been fine|pg||
nt|mcphee: key card was ok don't you think?|pg||
mb|3N!|nt|mcphee: well once E did not show @C cue|pg||
nt|flash: say it ain't so, Joe...|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|mb|d|nt|flash: all right - it offends the sensibilities, but it's certainly practical...|pg||
nt|mcphee: 3N serious slam try I expect|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjq: And for those who remember, Balcombe and Nick Gartaganis played on the same team together in 2002 in Salt Lake City, when they won the Gold|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: Judy questioning the dbl for the majors|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|nt|mcphee: uh oh|pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: wouldn't XX show the 1st round control?|pg||
nt|mcphee: they may not find it after no redble|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|flash: perhaps a variation on Paki Blackwood now...   show the void this time|pg||
mb|6C|nt|lml: so probably a push|pg||
nt|bg: How many would double 4 clubs in this sequence? probably gives more info to opps than partner|pg||
nt|mcphee: 6@C odd with void|pg||
nt|mcphee: i would be happy to give them that info|pg||
nt|flash: as Zia tells it, in Paki Blackwood, you ask for aces, then ask again so partner will tell you how many he really has...|pg||
nt|flash: with an odd   of key cards, it's 'std' to jump in the suit which represents the   of aces; with an even   of key cards, 5NT is 'std'|pg||
nt|flash: 10 IMPs on Board 30 - 5@S went down (4@S made here)|pg||
mb|p|mb|6S|mb|p|mb|7S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mcphee: well they got to it, wd|pg||
nt|flash: perhaps West realized his misbid??   this would definitely eliminate the u from my remaining sense of humor|pg||
nt|flash: (the 2nd u)|pg||
pc|d3|mc|13|nt|flash: i'm told they play exclusion, starting at 5NT|pg||
pg||
qx|o19|st||md|1SK92H873DKQT53C96,SA8764HT9DA986CAJ,S53HKJ654D4CKQ432,SQJTHAQ2DJ72CT875|sv|e|nt|starkist: how can you forget bobo|pg||
nt|flash: no problems...   so 1 there and 7 more on 26...|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|caitlin: Boris......don't tell him pleaseeeeee:)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hockey update  most canucks 3 chicago 1|pg||
mb|2S|mb|3S|nt|starkist: ir ur dreams martin|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d4|pc|d2|pc|dT|pc|dA|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: this will swing 10 for Gartaganis|pg||
nt|flash: so, of course, Caitlin will tell us who's on the Flock team, which awaits the winner of the Murray-Hoffer semi-final...|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: on slow trumps play 4M not 3NT |pg||
pc|hT|nt|dannymiles: Agree Nic. Side aces, kings and doubletons call for suit play|pg||
pc|hK|nt|czyzyk: actually 11imps|pg||
pc|hA|nt|caitlin: Mike Yuen...........|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|flash: good start...|pg||
nt|caitlin: hold on.....|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s2|pc|s4|pc|s3|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: you are a human computer Jurek :)|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s5|pg||
pc|s6|pc|c2|pc|sQ|pc|s9|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dQ|nt|caitlin: Dave Smith Maurice de la Salle|pg||
pc|d6|pc|c3|pg||
pc|h7|nt|czyzyk: :)|pg||
nt|stewball: eok would call this 11 imps from nowhere|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|nt|buffytvs: once again they are starting 8 boards apart.|pg||
mb|2H|nt|lml: yes|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I'm starting to think the CBF only has one set of boards...|pg||
mb|3H|nt|flash: so that 6@C showed an odd   of key cards with the void|pg||
mb|4D|mb|4S|nt|vugraphzjq: redbl is alerted, but i cant see what it is|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: support, less than limit raise...|pg||
nt|guppy: presumably Nick's passed hand XX = a raise in @s's with one of the top two honours...now the question is how many @c's will Balcombe pull out of the bidding box...|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjq: balcombe bid quick...the delay was the scribbling of the description of the redbl...|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjq: more scribbling by taylor...it looks like he is writing out their entire system regarding this bid...|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjq: 4c showed 6+ clubs and 4 hearts|pg||
nt|buffytvs: maybe someone can suggest that tomorrow they do it the usual way so we can get comparisons much faster|pg||
pc|d4|nt|guppy: hmmmm....I wonder if they were on the same wavelength on this one?  Did Balcombe also alert? |pg||
nt|flash: some play the cue bid to show 3-card support in a limit(+) raise; others either 3- or 4-card support|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dT|nt|vugraphzjq: i think they have different meanings for the 4c bid|pg||
nt|guppy: It's a rather common treatment when the opponents are silent, but quite another thing in a competitive auction...|pg||
nt|lml: so every hand in 3NT|pg||
nt|lml: well 2 out of 2|pg||
nt|buffytvs: never have to say you're sorry,. right?|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: taylor now saying that 4c is huge hand without 4 heaRTS...4C was 100% forcing|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hK|pc|hA|nt|flash: in the Closed Room, Silver's 3@S call was most likely competitive (and a 3@H call would have shown the limit+ raise)|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|guppy: Taylor bravely takes an action predicated on the possibility that he MIGHT have erred in his interpretation of 4@c |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|lml: cool lead|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|pc|s3|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: judy might lead a heart back...the dbl may have been lightner'|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: ish|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: plus the 9s at trick one may be pionting to hearts|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s5|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h5|nt|lml: does he have to say he is sorry now|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: or not|pg||
nt|flash: and an overtrick to boot...|pg||
nt|flash: which doesn't change the IMPs|pg||
pc|s6|nt|guppy: Not much too the play on this one....NS got past the last safe landing spot of 4@c thru a bidding misunderstanding....the nuances of when agreements are on or off in competition ...|pg||
nt|guppy: are tough to all cover even for a well-practiced partnership|pg||
pc|c4|pc|sT|pc|s9|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h8|pc|cJ|pc|h4|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dK|pc|d6|pc|h6|pg||
mc|11|nt|mcphee: i have been asked why murray to not use micheals|pg||
nt|flash: 10 IMPs it is|pg||
nt|mcphee: i tried to say that this was not a hand in weak or strong group for that bid|pg||
pg||

mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|caitlin: Welcome Danny, you now have a temporary visa to Canada|pg||
nt|3for3: great country :)|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d5|nt|starkist: looks like down|pg||
nt|caitlin: indeed but if I go on about that, we land up in the world of politics so I shall stop now:)|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: AK and a diamond|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: will make|pg||
nt|3for3: not clear who has the stiff club|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: but cannot afford trump play|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s7|pc|sQ|nt|starkist: on the bidding k/ace of @s|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cQ|pc|cA|nt|flash: did we ever acknowledge the Captain of the team already advancing to the Seniors' finals??   Dorn Flock, i believe...|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s9|pc|sJ|nt|3for3: this will make declarer's life easier, but seems like the easiest road to beat included a club ruff|pg||

nt|flash: 6 IMPs on 27 and 1 on 28|pg||
nt|caitlin: anyone know where he is from?|pg||
nt|caitlin: inside of Canada, that is|pg||
nt|caitlin: Calgary|pg||
nt|caitlin: and some team mates from Edmonton|pg||
nt|caitlin: and Yuen from Vancouver|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: back|pg||

nt|lml: I told you yesterday I am going to hire Gord to lead for me|pg||
nt|buffytvs: yesterday it was Piotr finding all the double dummy leads|pg||
mb|1S|nt|lml: well you can have Piotr and I will take Gord|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: fair enough|pg||
nt|flash: at these colors, it's marginally strong for the cue bid|pg||
mb|1N!|mb|p|nt|buffytvs: anyone outside Canada will probably not have heard of the EW pair, but these guys are seriously good players|pg||
mb|3S|nt|lml: once I went through a lot of world championship books to look at what won and lost the most imps ... and it was opening leads|pg||
nt|mcphee: to try to locate the 3 level fit with soft suits, not my cup of tea at all|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: they were on the team that won the IOC Grand Prix in 2000, and also the Commonwealth Games title|pg||
nt|lml: okay we are going to send some of those Yanks some of these boards!|pg||
mb|4S|nt|flash: 11 more IMPs on Board 31|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzjq: gartaganis play a strong c...|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjq: not surprised West passed 2nt|pg||
pc|dK|nt|buffytvs: West is not 'SDoubler' but Gord Campbell, by the way|pg||
nt|lml: playing under alias|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: no his bbo name|pg||
nt|lml: ah|pg||
nt|flash: flock led a @D vs 3NT (a @H was led here)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|buffytvs: like Fred Lerner -- idblu|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lml: on the ladies side I want one for Izzy and Sondra Blank.  They are very aggressive penalty doublers|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this is makeable, without cheating what is the line?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|buffytvs: sorry, IOC was 2002 -- not wearing my Salt Lake shirt right now|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sQ|nt|lml: the double nickname|pg||
nt|buffytvs: yes, but they double partscores that make -- you can have them on your team|pg||
nt|lml: idblu ... doubler... and how about gotcha|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|lml: no they get lots of numbers from nowhere|pg||
nt|buffytvs: meanwhile, back at the table... looks like a routine 4@H|pg||
nt|lml: the lead is helpful|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c7|nt|guppy: Playing their strong 1@c methods, Judy's choice of opening bid essentially valued her solitary @d as an x rather than a K.  Some players wouldn't hesitate to have opened 1N (15-17) ...|pg||
nt|guppy: with her hand as a least of bad alternatives - which would have led to 3N declared from her side - possibly making on a normalish @s x opening lead|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c5|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c2|pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||

nt|dannymiles: Korbel will have a shot to pickup, closed room reached 3NT after finding the spade fit|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|fabsayc: time to get those imps from nowhere back|pg||
nt|starkist: yes nick|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|stewball: 2@h would not occur to me|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|3for3: I must admit, even with the great shape, Jack high unfavorable preempts aren't my style|pg||
nt|starkist: now for the surprise lead|pg||
mb|3C|nt|caitlin: this is systemic Danny|pg||
nt|dannymiles: South's tactical bid sure worked here. Not easy vul vs not|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: 2H has a lot going for it in my mind|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|fabsayc: did it promise a two suiter?|pg||
mb|p|nt|starkist: fun to go down in 2@h and make 6@d|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|hJ|pc|h7|pc|h5|pc|h2|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h8|nt|stewball: 2@h at unfav is for solitaire players in my mind|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: how often does this happen is real life?|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h3|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h9|pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|3for3: without interference, declarer likely would have failed in the normal 4@S anyway|pg||

nt|lml: it was fun in Salt Lake City|pg||
nt|lml: I got to visit the Mormon sites and listen to the choir |pg||
nt|lml: and see the bridge of course|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjq: Keith : "nothing special"|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: Judy is asking what a 3NT opener is|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: Keith : solid major|pg||
mb|1N|nt|guppy: At unfavourable colors, 4@d would be the popular level to preempt with Keith's hand|pg||
nt|flash: thnx to our operator, Medhat Fawzy, for a great job|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: here 4@S is beatable on heart lead|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|vugraphzjq: Both Ross Taylor and Nick G are wearing their Tiger Woods Sunday outfits ... red golf shirts|pg||
mb|2S|nt|flash: and to Bruce and Bob for helping guide us through the boards|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|guppy: will NS find the @c ruff in North's hand to set the contract?  I would bet on them...|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: the ugly 3NT is cold on layout|pg||

nt|flash: thnx to the CBF and the local tournament committee for organizing this vugraph presentation and inviting us to participate|pg||
nt|flash: pls check your bookmarked BBO Vugraph Schedule web page for upcoming events and local times|pg||
pc|h5|nt|lml: Keith kind of bamboozled them into the wrong contract|pg||
nt|flash: we hope to see you back here for the 3rd quarter and/or on another BBO Vugraph presentation|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hT|pc|h7|pg||
nt|lml: with his hidden 5 bagger|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I'm not sure 3NT was intended for play... are you?|pg||
nt|lml: I think it was an offer to play ... in case Piotr had 3@s and a balanced hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: gord was not happy when dummy hit|pg||
nt|lml: I think he should have converted|pg||

pc|h4|pc|h9|pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d4|pc|dT|nt|guppy: that was a clever choice of @d spot cards by Keith, knowing that Ross would "know" that he had held back the 3|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this is not the way|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d7|nt|lml: a costly mistake but set up by Keith|pg||
nt|buffytvs: they have to hope that opps will go down in 4@S - which isn't impossible|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dA|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bg: Thanks Jim/ Bob|pg||
nt|bg: good job|pg||
mc|10|nt|fabsayc: korbel returned a heart in other match|pg||
nt|flash: thnx again, all; waiting for the comparison on Board 32|pg||
nt|flash: in as 4 IMPs...   47-28 session score, tightening the match|pg||
nt|mcphee: a slim lead for the expirienced team|pg||

mb|p|nt|niclecuyer: north will almost always bid either at first of second bid after 1Sp opening by W - why not bid first when you can? yes you can miss something but passing creates 0 problems|pg||
nt|starkist: they opened 2@h at both tables|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|starkist: the timid stay home and type on their computers|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: :) |pg||
mb|1C|nt|flash: mandatory that suchnesses be accompanied by a sign imploring specs 'not to try this at home...'|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: hi there|pg||
nt|ritong: need a moderator?:)|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: I type right now :)|pg||
mb|1H|mb|1S|mb|d!|an|support dbl|nt|caitlin: Henri we always need you, welcome you:)|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: welcome|pg||
nt|fabsayc: pretty safe to try at home, partners cant kill you|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: 5@c a better spot, but spades friendly, so 3nt OK|pg||
nt|starkist: we needed someone moderate|pg||
nt|flash: Board 29 in as a push...    winding down|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|flash: needs to grab this before the defense finds the @D switch...|pg||
nt|flash: (hold not thy breath??)|pg||
nt|3for3: in theory yes, in practice, unlikely|pg||

pc|cA|pc|s6|pc|c6|pc|c9|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d6|nt|3for3: not clear he did wrong.  spades could be 53, ya know|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dA|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: absolutely|pg||
pc|cK|nt|stewball: and a @d shift looks pretty impossible|pg||
pc|c2|pc|d3|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c3|nt|stewball: on this layout|pg||
nt|starkist: hard to shift to @d esp looking at the dummy|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, but that means south tried a @s from KQx with long @hs  possible, but unlikely|pg||
pc|h8|nt|czyzyk: He did well,  a diamond switch was unlikely|pg||

mb|p|nt|bg: Hi all|pg||
mb|1C|nt|lml: the forcing club might help them to get to the best spot... 5@C|pg||
mb|1S|nt|thurston:  hi bruce|pg||
nt|bg: Hi Paul|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|lml: now Gord should transfer and then maybe ...|pg||
nt|buffytvs: just bid game|pg||
nt|lml: yes|pg||
nt|buffytvs: having limited his hand he can get aggressive now|pg||
nt|lml: well bidding game is rich opposite 0-6|pg||
nt|lml: 0 isnt good enough|pg||
nt|lml: oh you may Gord|pg||
nt|buffytvs: yes :)|pg||
mb|3C|nt|lml: I dont think I would just bid game  ... you do need a fit|pg||
nt|lml: you are missing the AKQJ|pg||
nt|buffytvs: details, details|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: this hand we saw a brilliant discovery play in 3nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: well he did just bid game|pg||
nt|buffytvs: that works too -- Eats has a fine heart stopper|pg||
nt|buffytvs: and Gord has a source of tricks :)|pg||
nt|lml: spades break 4-4|pg||
nt|buffytvs: at least, he hopes it's a source of tricks|pg||
nt|lml: all is good|pg||
nt|lml: but they don't get style points|pg||
nt|lml: you need to get to 5@C to get 10/10 in the bidding contest|pg||
nt|buffytvs: if they lead a diamond, Piotr has to win it, else they can shift to spades in time|pg||
nt|lml: my guess is south will lead a spade|pg||
nt|flash: 'modern' bridge uses the cue bid to show a limit raise (or better) in the opened suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: sigh|pg||
nt|buffytvs: well, that takes the pressure off|pg||
nt|buffytvs: but understandable|pg||
nt|thurston:  ERM will not be impressed with G's dummy|pg||
pc|s7|nt|guppy: this is a difficulkt hand for NS to restrain themselves from getting too high - at favourable vulnerability Taylor did remarkably well not stepping in immediately over 1@S |pg||
nt|thurston:  even  a hall of famer will be hard pressed to find more thna 7 tricks with foul club lie|pg||
nt|flash: here, North wants to force to game|pg||
nt|bg: some would bid 2nt with S hand not sure if John is allowed to bid NT:)|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sT|nt|fabsayc: after two rounds of clubs, second ducked, how do you proceed|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|flash: (as has been mentioned, probably expecting a bit sounder call in 2nd seat)|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|s4|pc|sK|pg||
nt|lml: so 10 tricks at least|pg||
nt|lml: and really not much chance for more|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c5|nt|fabsayc: wolpert played a spade to ace and lead diamond jack|pg||
nt|fabsayc: when it was not covered he finessed spades, ran that suit and finessed in hearts|pg||
nt|fabsayc: effectively taking both red finesses to make the hand|pg||
nt|lml: this is a good time to get a beverage|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dJ|pc|d3|pc|d2|pg||
nt|flash: but an immediate 3NT closes off too many possible contracts|pg||
nt|thurston:  ERM has very large hands and one of those will be massaging his own forehead right now|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d9|pc|dK|nt|flash: these are 16-board quarters; we've started with this board to allow the Open Room to have comparisons fairly quickly|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|fabsayc: declarer has the same possibility now|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c9|pc|cT|pc|h8|pg||
pc|h3|nt|flash: we won't see any changes on the scoreboard until the Open Room has caught up; we won't see any comparisons until we roll over to Board 17|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h7|pc|h2|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|guppy: Although I have the deepest respect for Nick G. (not just as feared bridge opponent but away from the table too), here he succumbed to greed by not passing out the opponents choice ...|pg||
nt|guppy: of his far better minor...|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: he diamond goes on the heart jack and the diamond jack gets ruffed later,|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: players have gone to the bathroom...|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: Andy Stark (creemore) will be the operator for the next few hands|pg||
nt|guppy: The washroom break is very clever partnership management tactics by Nick: he just made a serious blunder, his wife went for a number, and it's time to take a break and regroup so ...|pg||
nt|guppy: that neither of them is dwelling on this when they pull the cards out for the next hand|pg||
pc|sA|pc|h4|pc|c3|pg||
nt|fabsayc: running the spades wont help him guess which red finesse is working|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|pc|c7|pc|d6|pg||
nt|flash: that will allow the extra undertrick|pg||

nt|vugraphzjq: by the way, taylor and balcombe first played together in 1976 at a regional in Kingston|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|bg: another light opener for S|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2C|nt|fabsayc: perhaps he decided to take heart finesse expecting other declarer to finesse in diamonds|pg||
mb|2D|mb|2H|nt|guppy: Labouring as I am without the benefit of their partnership agreements, perhaps Nick's clues to passing Balcombe's 5@c were as follows: (a) she didn't open 1@c, and more importantly ...|pg||
nt|guppy: (b) she didn't XX|pg||
nt|bg: S should pass if you open light best not to freely rebid|pg||
nt|flash: the 5-card major and the 5-5 distribution make this a much better hand than the last one|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|lml: a club lead would work well against 3NT but I dont see how you can find it from the east hand|pg||
nt|buffytvs: Ross really want to have a punt at 3NT|pg||
nt|lml: oh yes he does|pg||
nt|lml: but will he|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: yes  he is playing in his bidding box|pg||
nt|buffytvs: vulnerable with a good 5-card suit -- I say he will|pg||
nt|buffytvs: Colbert's Rule :)|pg||
nt|lml: me too|pg||
nt|buffytvs: look for reasons to bid, not excuses for not bidding|pg||
nt|lml: but 2NT said he had a very good hand|pg||
nt|lml: so its a what the heck bid|pg||
nt|flash: but, at the risk of getting shut out if the opps bid and raise @Ss, i'd pass initially and hope to be able to show my 2-suiter|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: of he was soo disciplined|pg||
nt|buffytvs: discipine wins out|pg||
nt|flash: a @D lead is actually best for the defense, but quite unlikely|pg||
pc|h7|nt|buffytvs: I think he would have a poretty good shot at 3NT|pg||
nt|lml: yes, I suppose if he was going to bid 3NT he should have just done it in the first place|pg||
nt|buffytvs: even misguessing diamonds there are a lot of chances|pg||
nt|flash: holding long/strong trumps, it's usually right to lead a long suit to try to tap declarer out (have him lose control)|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hK|pc|h8|pg||
nt|lml: a club lead would be tough though|pg||
pc|c9|nt|fabsayc: this may make|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|pc|cT|pg||
nt|lml: I guess not really he has 3 clubs|pg||
nt|flash: we can see (and the auction sounded as though) South, not North had the @C shortness|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|nt|guppy: Here's an example of where Nick G. accorded full value to his stiff @cK by treating his hand as 17-19 balanced with his 1@c then 1N sequence|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s3|pg||
pc|s4|nt|flash: too impatient|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|fabsayc: well done by gordon|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s7|pg||
nt|lml: yes he was making it I think|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|nt|guppy: Keith is "sure" he's giving Ross a ruff....snd suggesting a @h return|pg||
nt|flash: looking at dummy's @D suit|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s9|nt|flash: that was exactly the wrong medicine|pg||
pc|h2|pc|c2|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|h3|pc|h5|pg||
nt|buffytvs: one more trick for the defense and that's all she wrote|pg||
nt|flash: West needs to get in to cash the @H winner|pg||
pc|c5|nt|vugraphzjq: Taylor had his fingers on the @H2, but now in the tank|pg||

mb|p|mb|3C|nt|niclecuyer: good night|pg||
nt|3for3: a bit surprised that was not good enough for big @C|pg||
nt|flash: 2@C natural and limited (they apparently don't include stiff Queens in hand evaluation|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: even so, KQJxxx with AKQx along is huge|pg||
mb|p|nt|caitlin: too strong|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s2|nt|starkist: will be starting from scratch tommorrow|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|caitlin: for 2@C as evidenced by not getting to 4@H|pg||
nt|3for3: perhaps 3@H over 3@C...|pg||
nt|flash: 6 IMPs to Gartaganis on Board 30, so they'll retain the lead after this board|pg||
nt|dannymiles: So appears today's 64 boards were basically for not. |pg||
nt|caitlin: good practice:)|pg||

nt|bg: nor the first one:)|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1H|nt|guppy: The key to this successful defence was Taylor's duck of the S!K, severing declarer's communications....simple yet devastatingly effective|pg||
mb|2C|nt|thurston:  3rd 11 hcp opening in a row|pg||
nt|flash: ok, specs...    time for the BBO Vugraph lottery...    how many 11-point hands will be opened this set???|pg||

nt|mcphee: murray does not like this 2@S much|pg||
nt|bg: best way for Eric to make up for the overcall is to pass now:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: very tough slam to bid, but starting with 2@C may work|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: 4@S|pg||
nt|buffytvs: yes -- the ultimate save -- one that makes :)|pg||
nt|lml: this is the type of hand that leads to double game swings|pg||
nt|lml: big boards|pg||
nt|buffytvs: certainly does|pg||
nt|flash: welcome to Bob McPhee|pg||
nt|mcphee: hi all|pg||
nt|thurston:  hey Bob|pg||
nt|mcphee: thirsty|pg||
nt|bg: John not happy with pass but will be when dummy comes down|pg||
nt|mcphee: he was in hope of game for sure|pg||
nt|mcphee: 2 will be a struggle|pg||
pc|c5|nt|lml: I think this will be played north south but maybe one too high|pg||
pc|c6|nt|buffytvs: and Ross is thinking, can he have two black aces and four hearts and I';m cold for 6?|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@H P 4@D cue bid should get this done|pg||
pc|sK|nt|lml: I think Piotr had to get the diamond bid in to get the save|pg||
nt|lml: /make|pg||
nt|buffytvs: tough to judge EW|pg||
nt|lml: good board for Korbel though|pg||
nt|lml: maybe a very good board|pg||
nt|buffytvs: no great distribution and few high cards|pg||
nt|buffytvs: certainly hard to see them losing IMPs here|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sT|nt|bg: John will probably play W for dia queen as part  of a 13 point opener|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|fabsayc: oops, the semi-fatal 1430 convention|pg||
nt|buffytvs: this could, as you said, easily be a double game swing|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c7|pc|cQ|pc|c9|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: discussion re bid meanings |pg||
nt|buffytvs: a 3@D fit jump from East, if available, might do the trick|pg||
nt|flash: he might have a count on the hand by the time he's ready to tackle @Ds?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lml: yes|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d8|pc|dT|pg||
nt|flash: partner's low @C suggests continuing the suit - i think East's hesitation was as overbid|pg||
nt|bg: problem solved|pg||
nt|mcphee: well that was a welcome swtich|pg||
pc|c8|nt|fabsayc: the % play is two finesses, but here only one entry so take discard and play heart ace|pg||
pc|cK|nt|buffytvs: but equal colours, it's really hard to see from either hand|pg||
nt|lml: that would have worked and probably lead to +100|pg||
pc|s3|pc|c4|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s8|pc|h2|pc|s6|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s9|pc|h3|nt|mcphee: do not see the reason to play @D by yuen at all|pg||

pc|dK|pc|h4|pc|d3|pc|d6|pg||

nt|guppy: caught E-W "speeding" for +500 in 2@sX'd tipped NS into going minus |pg||
nt|bg: E probably wondering where were  pards opening points|pg||

mb|1H|nt|fabsayc: operator, what is this 2@D bid|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mcphee: good 5@D, not so good 5@H:)|pg||
nt|flash: 4-card majors/ACOLish  ??|pg||
mb|2S|mb|4S|nt|buffytvs: in the OR, they found the deadly trump lead against 5@C, and declarer just sort of ran out of tricks|pg||

mb|d|nt|vugraphzjq: not sure, think opening with d|pg||
nt|mcphee: well 3rd seat 4 baggers allowed|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjq: opener|pg||
nt|fabsayc: probably win in hand and finesse diamonds|pg||
nt|bg: no standard 4-5 card major system 4 in 3rd seat|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|buffytvs: better judged auction here|pg||
nt|mcphee: best pull this one|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: so a pickup here|pg||
mb|d|nt|flash: in that context, i like the 1@H opener - you'd certainly feel more comfortable if partner led that suit than @Ds|pg||
nt|thurston:  the way to stop a 5level advance: penalty dbl them in 4!|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: exactly Paul|pg||

mb|3S|nt|lml: next year|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjq: Tay-Bal play Rusinow leads|pg||

nt|lml: oh it is going down|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cA|pc|c9|nt|guppy: Nick's hand is the nth thousandth instalment in the never-ending debate between the relative merits of opening 1@h (the winning choice here) versus 1N  (my choice on his cards)|pg||

nt|lml: yes and great contestands too :)|pg||
nt|guppy: Nick may well have dropped the @hQ anyway - why would Taylor be attacking @h's with the @h8 from Q8x?|pg||

nt|guppy: My money is on Nick|pg||

nt|lml: maybe a club abd a diamond through|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: clubs and spades don't break, diamonds offside -- you're right, not friendly|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: 2@D bart or gazilli or similar|pg||
nt|lml: 1@C is strong and artificial and Judy is showing a positive with clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: i think 6@S makes on this deal|pg||
nt|buffytvs: on a turmp lead?|pg||
nt|lml: maybe by ruffing out clubs|pg||

pc|hA|nt|lml: it isnt a contract I would want to be in anyway|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|pc|hT|pg||
pc|h6|nt|vugraphzjq: 6@S needs the friendly breaks and yes, probably a non trump lead|pg||
nt|lml: so no fantasies |pg||
nt|lml: in a reasonable spot|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: here they are in 3NT, same as the other table (on a shorter auction)|pg||

nt|lml: it is very relaxing|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: Keith just led out of turn the @S9|pg||
nt|lml: I would accept it |pg||
nt|buffytvs: even behind screens -- lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: Director Bev Ross is telling Judy all her options, |pg||
nt|lml: from Judy's hand it should play better from Nick's side|pg||
nt|buffytvs: Confucius say 'man who lead of turn does not know what to lead -- accept it'|pg||
nt|lml: and a spade lead is hardly frignthening|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: Judy is thinking of accepting and letting Nick play the hand|pg||
nt|buffytvs: out of turn|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: will bbo let me do this?|pg||
nt|lml: that is a good question !|pg||
nt|buffytvs: lol -- it might not -- you might have to change the auction|pg||
nt|buffytvs: there's a thought -- Fred needs to give operators an override for this situation|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: I will wait until  the first trick is played as Nick is now the declarer,  Someoe please tell Fred and Uday we need a new feature on bbo|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: at the other table the spade nine was also led, Wolpert ducked a club, a spade was continued and wolpert went back to clubs and claimed 5|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: just a matter of overtricks if the Defense can find a diamond shift in time|pg||

nt|buffytvs: I think Nick's looking for a red suit squeeze|pg||

nt|vugraphzjq: I'll predict an imp goes to the Korbelian Squad here|pg||
nt|flash: West was threatening to get a @S ruff anyway...|pg||
pc|s6|nt|buffytvs: this will work -- he sets up a club by force, and East will have to break a pointed suit|pg||

pc|s8|pg||
nt|lml: I dont think there is a squeeze|pg||

nt|vugraphzjq: if Gartaganis go on to win by one imp it will be beause Klimo played that spade suit for one loser!|pg||
nt|buffytvs: having won the @SQ, he could have finessed the heart too|pg||
nt|buffytvs: but that's very greedy :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: another 20-20 deal -- who will get NT in fist?|pg||
nt|mcphee: they might bid them all here|pg||
mb|1D|nt|buffytvs: not a bad slam if they can get South on play --|pg||
nt|buffytvs: there we go|pg||
nt|bg: I do not like NS chances of taking any tricks on this deal|pg||
nt|mcphee: bg has a good eye:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|buffytvs: in the OR, North opened an 11-14 NT, which I confess I would not with hand vulnerable|pg||
nt|buffytvs: But he made 7 tricks so all was well|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: if you play the range you should make the bid|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I guess that's why I don;t then -- I prefer the much more robust 12-14 range|pg||
nt|lml: and besides in all our years of weak notrump only one player ever got us|pg||
nt|buffytvs: only one pair in fact|pg||
mb|2H|nt|lml: obviously a spade lead will defeat 6@D|pg||
nt|lml: yes|pg||
nt|buffytvs: twice|pg||
nt|lml: should we reveal the name|pg||
nt|buffytvs: nah|pg||
nt|lml: they were playing in this event|pg||
nt|mcphee: kinda prefer to open E 1N|pg||
nt|bg: 7 anything except spades|pg||
nt|flash: values too soft for a reverse?   (1NT far too 'modern' for my tastes)|pg||
nt|mcphee: just not my sort of reverse hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: with orth playing it|pg||
mb|3D|nt|buffytvs: without a spade lead it's 75% or so|pg||
nt|lml: if they get there will Judy find it|pg||
nt|buffytvs: you can play a heart up first, then finesse in spades later if that fails|pg||
nt|buffytvs: but not together as a pair|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|buffytvs: so we need have no fear any more|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|lml: we they are committed to the slam now|pg||
nt|mcphee: partner bids 2N ingberman you have to bid 3@D which looks all wrong to me|pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: 3@D forcing, but...|pg||
nt|flash: setting @Ds as trumps, so this is Redwood??|pg||
nt|bg: not sure of EW bidding methods from this point on so will just watch and se where they go|pg||
nt|flash: far too esoteric/dangerous for my tastes - over 2@H i bid 4NT...|pg||
nt|mcphee: gee can you do that Jim, invite isn't it?|pg||
mb|5D|nt|buffytvs: with a stiff club in dummy, and a trump lead unattractive, she may well lead a spade |pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: spotlight on Judy to find the spade lead now|pg||
nt|lml: I dont think a heart lead is very attractive.  Its possible she might|pg||
mb|p|mb|7N|nt|lml: yes we are on the same page|pg||
nt|lml: but then again she could lead anything|pg||
nt|lml: a lot of imps on one decision|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: wow!|pg||
nt|buffytvs: 26 IMPs swing total here on one card -- and she's a winner|pg||
nt|lml: good for her|pg||
nt|guppy: bravo - well reasoned by Judy|pg||
nt|lml: Keith has no choice at all|pg||
nt|buffytvs: as long as Nick returns a heart right away of course|pg||
nt|lml: I do remember that we got Paul Soloway and his client|pg||
nt|buffytvs: actually, Kit Woolsey and Ed Manfield got us once too -- cost us a Spingold match if I recall correctly|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: i like the 7 shot here|pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: 5@D should be 2 key cards with the trump queen|pg||
nt|flash: believe me, West didn't think it was a shot at all|pg||
nt|mcphee: i'm sure:)|pg||
nt|flash: he could count 13 tricks|pg||
pc|sT|nt|lml: yes he has to find the right ace to cash but then a heart is more likely to go away|pg||
nt|buffytvs: he will guess they're off an ace though, since no-one tried for 7|pg||
nt|lml: so that might be a hint|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: Nick and Judy play 4th best leads so I doubt there is anything in the 2 for suit preference|pg||
nt|lml: the fact that the club shortness encouraged balcome suggests he has some club length|pg||
nt|guppy: Nick has to find @h return....perhaps Judy's spot card perhaps could have been higher ...|pg||
nt|lml: I must have blotted it out|pg||
nt|flash: after something like this, it's good form to apologize to the opps...|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|nt|buffytvs: wd|pg||
nt|lml: this looks like 7 tricks|pg||
nt|bg: yes as Eric is picking up his cards from the floor|pg||
nt|flash: unless you really hate them, then gales of laughter might be appropriate...|pg||
nt|mcphee: well it is a bit better than 50%|pg||
nt|mcphee: a possible pointed squeeze on S|pg||
nt|mcphee: but of course not to worry as eric gets caught in a show up squeeze|pg||
nt|flash: on whichever hand holds @S length and the @DK??|pg||
nt|mcphee: sure|pg||
nt|mcphee: if n/s hands switched you make right?|pg||
nt|flash: the way to approach a situation like this is to picture the ending you want/need|pg||
nt|flash: so West will be left with the @S3 and the @D3 (style points for 'unblocking')|pg||
nt|flash: and East will hold the @DAQ|pg||
nt|mcphee: yup|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|lml: I dont think I would read a lot into the spot card|pg||
nt|lml: but lots of work to do|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I was about to say -- a curious hand, both side can make 1NT.  Typical on flat 20-20's.  That's why you have to get the bid in first|pg||
nt|buffytvs: though here, the defence have 3 tricks in; seem like they should have time get one more in each suit|pg||
nt|lml: what is taking the time on this trick|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: sorry, suzie went for a nonent and i lost the play|pg||
nt|lml: ah|pg||
nt|buffytvs: got a result for us?|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|lml: that is a bunch of deserved imps|pg||
nt|buffytvs: and back in the lead|pg||
nt|buffytvs: so no swing|pg||
nt|lml: so some times they can only make 1NT in one direction|pg||
pc|c4|nt|bg: spade Q QJ clubs 4 rounds of hearts then spade to ace cash clubs and later up pops the dia king|pg||

nt|caitlin: smith echo lets you tell pd if you like opening lead; or if pd led to find his pd, to let person on lead to give attitude to opening lead|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: love it personally - my recent partners play standard and I have to think all the time (which is usually bad)|pg||
nt|caitlin: with smith echo, when declarer gets in a HIGH card in declarer's suit says I like opening lead; with reverse smith a LOW card says I liked the lead|pg||

nt|lml: Nick is not going to take this too far|pg||

nt|lml: do you remember the 3NT down 2 early on with the 6-5 red suit hand|pg||
nt|lml: it was a push|pg||
nt|buffytvs: in 4@S or 3NT?|pg||
nt|lml: North opened 2@H at both tables|pg||

mb|p|nt|lml: yes|pg||
nt|flash: and this was the latest test in the 'au courant' bidding contest...|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: or rather 4@S making 5|pg||
pc|dT|nt|lml: the score for the half on compared boards at this time is 17-16|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I see Judy found a raise to 3@H and Darren was endplayed into bidding 3NT|pg||

nt|bg: better lead a club|pg||
nt|flash: cash the @Cs for down 1...   not today|pg||
nt|mcphee: oh well:)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|fabsayc: in precision system, the 1@D opening is ambigous as to length|pg||
nt|lml: 4@C is too high|pg||
nt|lml: thats 500|pg||
nt|lml: 5@H|pg||
nt|flash: i can make a case for treating this as similar to leading against a gambling 3NT - |pg||
pc|d2|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I like the call though|pg||
nt|buffytvs: so that one is safely scored up as far as Gartaganis is concerned, and now they have to worry about 24|pg||
pc|dK|nt|buffytvs: pushed them to the 5-level|pg||
nt|lml: yes it is low cost way to get them up|pg||
pc|d8|nt|lml: but its enough now!|pg||
nt|buffytvs: Ross doesn't believe the 5-level belongs to the opponents, obviously|pg||
nt|lml: now they have to guess diamonds|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: Keith will need to find the @DQ, does he play Nick who holds 4 or Judy who opened the bidding?|pg||
nt|buffytvs: as long as the defence ruffs out the @C10|pg||
nt|lml: you can go either way |pg||
pc|c2|nt|lml: well I guess east wanted a diamond lead but he wasnt getting one|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|fabsayc: we use to play 1@D followed by 2@C showed real clubs, not necissarily diamonds|pg||
pc|s9|nt|buffytvs: he knows Judy has about 10 cards in the round suits...|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: yes good point|pg||
pc|c7|nt|fabsayc: so there is a need for a way to show primary diamonds, and that is the 2@D opening|pg||
nt|lml: he will think about it a while|pg||
nt|flash: the @CK is unlikely to be on your right; maybe lead the A and see dummy...   (and see that you've given up 5 tempi and the contract|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|bg: my mother always told me to lead aces vs preempts and she didnt play bridge|pg||
pc|c5|nt|lml: they are moving in to worse contract here|pg||
nt|buffytvs: this can't be thinker for East surely?|pg||
pc|s2|pc|c3|pc|c8|pg||
nt|buffytvs: well I think we can safely say that EW are going plus here|pg||
nt|lml: well they landed somewhere that east-west can beat|pg||
pc|sK|nt|lml: West knows where the @SJ is so one presumes he is thinking about what to do later in the hand|pg||
pc|sA|nt|vugraphzjq: they are short for time|pg||
pc|s3|nt|buffytvs: beating it 1 is not a problem -- beating it more may be tougher|pg||
nt|buffytvs: playing hearts might work out best for the defence|pg||
nt|lml: I think this is likely one down|pg||
nt|lml: but it is complicated|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hQ|nt|buffytvs: how long do they have left?|pg||
nt|lml: I am going to guess he will get it wrong|pg||
nt|lml: invoking the commentator's curse rule|pg||
nt|lml: if he gets it wrong Judy will have won the board|pg||
nt|buffytvs: Keith's  a very good declarer -- don't bet against him|pg||
nt|lml: its not that|pg||
nt|lml: its that Nick has the diamond length clearly|pg||
nt|buffytvs: yes -- but this is almost a table feel thing|pg||
nt|lml: and there is enough for him to hold a queen|pg||
nt|buffytvs: he does hold a queen :)|pg||
nt|lml: Judy wouldnt value the heart queen|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|pg||
nt|lml: diamond queen|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lml: that works fine for the defence|pg||
pc|h3|nt|buffytvs: nobody's going to throw a diamond and help him|pg||
nt|lml: the high heart might have helped though|pg||
nt|buffytvs: if you blieve it :)|pg||
nt|lml: now it looks like Nick has the @HQ|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: yes when the D has the declarer booked, all bets are off|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hK|pg||
nt|buffytvs: i think tapping declarer in hearts might end up with 2 down|pg||
nt|lml: at this point they have 3 in and the @CA and @DQ and a spade overruff|pg||
nt|lml: down 2|pg||
nt|buffytvs: yes|pg||

nt|lml: we may be ducplicating the result though|pg||
nt|lml: so he is trying for the slam|pg||
nt|buffytvs: costs nothing|pg||
nt|lml: but Ross wont love his spade suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: Ross will hate his trumps but like his controls|pg||
nt|lml: 4@C is a good bid for Keith|pg||
nt|lml: they could get there|pg||
mb|3N|nt|lml: but Ross is bid out,,, its really up to Balcombe|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I think they will|pg||
nt|buffytvs: but he has to go now -- biding 4@D isn't going to get him anywhere, and he knows that|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: no Nick wont pass a taekout double and he didnt|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: smooth pass from KB|pg||
nt|lml: Balcome likes clubs!|pg||
nt|lml: if he bids 4@D then Ross will just sign off I would think|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: I dont see how Ross can bid any more than 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: ohh|pg||
nt|lml: its okay... it doesnt matter|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lml: its a little birdy hand cheep cheep cheep|pg||
nt|buffytvs: ah yes-- didn't see the result in the other room|pg||
nt|mcphee: up to 8 tricks now|pg||
nt|flash: the @HQ would have saved a trick, but there's absolutely no reason not to lead low here...|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h9|nt|buffytvs: he has to but then Keith will know there's no @HK opposite|pg||
nt|lml: he was endplayed|pg||
nt|mcphee: in a way the play is a bit easy|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lml: tough auction |pg||
pc|d4|pc|d3|nt|lml: I see your point though|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mcphee: you can not really afford to discard @S on @D|pg||
pc|d5|nt|fabsayc: usually 1nt bidder has clubs|pg||
nt|buffytvs: yes, but I'm trying to put 13 points in the south hand (4432) which don;t give him a play for slam|pg||
nt|flash: perhaps, but that wasn't the winning choice...|pg||
nt|mcphee: so you will lead a @S up to the K and claim|pg||
nt|flash: just give up 2 @C tricks??|pg||
pc|d7|pc|h4|pg||
nt|mcphee: low @C to 9?|pg||
nt|bg: cute hand W can win heart ten play 3 rounds of dia conceding queen but later squeezes himself on the run of dia N has to keep AQX in clubs|pg||
nt|mcphee: you are right bruce|pg||
nt|bg: academic now no play|pg||
nt|flash: i also don't understand not overtaking there?|pg||
nt|flash: the threatened 17 IMPs have appeared for Board 25|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|nt|buffytvs: haven't been able to yet|pg||
nt|lml: since Taylor did not cuebid hearts it suggests his points are elsewhere|pg||
pc|c9|nt|buffytvs: right -- so which 13 with no @HK would be bad?|pg||
nt|lml: so a lost opportunity|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|flash: well...|pg||
pc|dK|pc|s6|pc|c5|pc|d6|pg||
nt|buffytvs: interesting that Nick pulled the double -- Larry Cohen says that you shouldn't pass low-level doubles just because you have four trumps -- you need good spots, which Nick didn't ...|pg||
nt|buffytvs: have|pg||
nt|lml: I hate playing these hands but Nick is actually winning imps|pg||
pc|dT|pc|c7|nt|fabsayc: however south knew his partner had values, and the only hand that would get shut out by 1D opening would be with clubs|pg||
pc|c6|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|lml: the double was takeout and that meant Judy was likely to be short in spades|pg||
nt|lml: he might have taken the safe bid of 3@H knowing Judy had 5|pg||
pc|h6|nt|flash: we might even be able to retire on the proceeds for quashing the tape of this set...|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lml: I think he was hoping she would pull to hearts if she didnt have abetter club fit|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|pg||
nt|bg: now he makes Eric asleep at switch squeeze doesnt exist anymore|pg||
pc|d9|nt|buffytvs: yes -- Darren didn't know his partner had 5 hearts, and North had already bid clubs, so maybe he was endplayed into passing the double|pg||
pc|s4|pc|cT|nt|fabsayc: so an initial club lead would have been quite logical and made this interesting|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|mcphee: what a hand:)|pg||

mb|1N|mb|2S|mb|6C|nt|flash: this board will take us to the halfway point of the set; after this, we'll have comparisons the rest of the way home|pg||
mb|6S|mb|d|nt|caitlin: easy to go to www.bbotv.com/vugraph to see both tables|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|flash: the Closed Room is much closer to keeping pace with us, so we'll also see scores showing up on the scorecard. if not the scoreboard|pg||
mb|p|pc|cA|nt|starkist: shd be serious 3nt situation|pg||
pc|c2|nt|stewball: wow|pg||
pc|c8|nt|stewball: 5@d|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: big bid|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|stewball: thats one description|pg||
pc|c4|nt|fabsayc: redouble would have been bigger|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: :)|pg||
nt|flash: can escape for down 1|pg||
nt|stewball: i guess S isnt allowed to dbl 2@s with fewer than 4 @d|pg||
nt|flash: i think the deal generator has awakened...|pg||
nt|stewball: must be a rule|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: dan sent the board back with a xx by judy as a joke|pg||
nt|czyzyk: It is hard to be 1 down only|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: he can make it on diamond to the K I think|pg||
nt|mr murray: down 1 takes very bad def. with spade plays down 2-3 more likely|pg||
nt|starkist: we'll soon see|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: no he will lose an extra spade - wrond analysies|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: wrong|pg||

nt|fabsayc: hmm|pg||
nt|czyzyk: 4@s was touch and go, down on a club lead|pg||
nt|flash: trump there...   with the @HJ falling, hand not that bad...|pg||
nt|fabsayc: does anybody understand the club play|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h5|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: not sure I do |pg||
nt|czyzyk: somebody has to play trumps at some point|pg||
nt|czyzyk: I do not understand club play as well|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: seems like we going to get a diamond play now...|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|flash: needed to play K to hold it to down 2|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h6|nt|fabsayc: i suppose if hearts 3-2 he might do ok on a cross ruff was the thinking|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h2|pg||

nt|vugraphzjq: last one|pg||
nt|lml: check out the double game swing hand .. it is a surprise|pg||
nt|buffytvs: @HQJ, @CAQ, @SJ, @DA -- there's a play on that hand|pg||
nt|lml: look at board 24 everybody|pg||
nt|buffytvs: we didn't think of that auction!|pg||
nt|flash: if the previous one was a 1NT opener, then this is easy...|pg||
mb|1N|nt|flash: Board 26 in as a push|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: a club partscore didnt enter my mind|pg||
mb|4C!|nt|lml: good result north -south|pg||
nt|lml: bridge is always fascinating isnt it|pg||
nt|flash: Gerber (ace asking; no trump suit)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjq: the RDBl shows 4+ hearts|pg||
nt|buffytvs: but EW do have flattish hands, which is why they didn't bid them up to 4@S in this room|pg||
nt|lml: but north south never found their heart fit|pg||
nt|buffytvs: don't think they'll find the save here after this start|pg||
mb|4D|an|1 or 4|nt|flash: shouldn't use 1430 here |pg||
nt|mcphee: now E hand not sure what to do|pg||
nt|flash: i'm told they use the higher steps to show 2 with a minimum and 2 with a maximum|pg||
nt|mcphee: 1430 gerber |pg||
nt|flash: 4M now to play; 4NT natural (and may be only choice); 5@C asks Kings|pg||
nt|flash: (and, by the by, one should play specific kings, even over Gerber)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: nt not so good with a @H lead:)|pg||
mb|4N|nt|buffytvs: in the OR, EW never bid, which makes life much easier for NS|pg||
nt|lml: notrump is coming|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|flash: so we'd all xfer to @Cs and then use Redwood...|pg||
nt|mcphee: ok eric the sun is shinning on you now:)|pg||
nt|flash: and avoid this|pg||
pc|d5|nt|lml: I knew it|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: this will go down|pg||
nt|lml: it means never having to say you are sorry|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: 2@D showed fewer than 3 hearts|pg||
nt|lml: he might well|pg||
nt|buffytvs: why will it go down?|pg||
nt|lml: he has to guess diamonds|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: he is bound to get the diamonds wrong|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: with the X|pg||
nt|lml: Judt doubled |pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: if it goes down it is the curse of the diamond queen for Bal-Tay|pg||
nt|starkist: rather make a short suit game try|pg||
nt|mcphee: gin|pg||
nt|flash: board 27 in as a push|pg||
nt|mcphee: xfer to @C then show short @S another popular wat|pg||
pc|dK|nt|lml: we are so on the same wavelength Nick|pg||
nt|buffytvs: no -- this time he'll play her for it -- won't get caight twice :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: different declarer so perhaps |pg||
nt|buffytvs: he's either laughing or cursing to himself right now|pg||
nt|lml: I think he will get it right|pg||
nt|lml: so with 1 compare to compare it is 25 imps to 34 imps in this set|pg||
nt|lml: so very tight|pg||
pc|dT|nt|lml: very well played bridge|pg||
nt|buffytvs: Australia's Ian McCance, who wrote a book of defensive problems for us, thinks 4@S is in jeopardy.  Let's see...|pg||
nt|lml: that lead cant hurt|pg||
nt|buffytvs: right|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|lml: maybe without a diamond lead|pg||
pc|c4|nt|lml: but it isnt clear at all|pg||
nt|lml: did Judy really block spades?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: yes the spades were played that way!|pg||
nt|lml: not good|pg||
nt|buffytvs: doens't matter though|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: yes but he won't matted|pg||
nt|buffytvs: not enough tricks if he gets diamond wrong without playing on clubs|pg||
nt|lml: good point|pg||
nt|buffytvs: but it wasn't a good play|pg||
nt|lml: it was a tired play|pg||
nt|buffytvs: that's the second time we've said that- and there are 6 sets left in this final|pg||
nt|lml: well it is the last board of the set|pg||
nt|buffytvs: the good news is that they have started the last board, so time is not an issue any more|pg||
nt|lml: that is when you can easily lose concentration|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: surely with AQJx the ace is right?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|buffytvs: this is the last board today, which brings us to half way, and very little in it between these two teams,|pg||
pc|cK|nt|buffytvs: Ian says they needed to start the @HA|pg||
nt|lml: he can ruff a diamond and just lose 2 clubs and a heart|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|flash: the good news (other than that there are only 5 boards left in the set after this one) is that we'll have comparisons the rest of the way|pg||
nt|mcphee: i like the shortness treatment after the minor xfer|pg||
pc|c8|nt|buffytvs: any honor for sure|pg||
nt|czyzyk: club lead beats it|pg||
pc|s7|nt|lml: but this will make now|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|lml: well he got it right|pg||
nt|buffytvs: so it didn't matter|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: well nicely done|pg||
nt|buffytvs: which will tei the match|pg||
pc|h7|nt|lml: points to those who thought he would!|pg||
