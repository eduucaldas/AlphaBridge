nt|sybarra: hello all |pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: after 44:0 IMPs for Hungary in last round, the first time Turkey is not here at the BBO table...|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|caitlin: welcome:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: hello and welcome to the 9th round of the German Bridge Trophy|pg||
nt|caitlin: South will definitely keep in this gambling NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: Hello Ellen|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|mcarroll: I would overcall 2@D rather than Double on that S hand|pg||
nt|caitlin: same folks now play 'chicken gambling' which allows you to have an outside Ace or King:)|pg||
nt|caitlin: Hi Lukas!!|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: Yes he kept 3NT, but thought pretty long about his options|pg||
nt|shevek: so Winkiboy 258, Israel 253|pg||
mb|p|nt|dimi: most of the international teams started on wednesday to play the Nation Cup, quite exausting 4 complete days of bridge|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: multi 2 @D |pg||
nt|sybarra: and hello Lukas |pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: hi Rashed, hi Shirley|pg||
pc|c5|nt|sybarra: hello Rashed,  sorry if late |pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi all|pg||
nt|sybarra: hi Martin :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: well in time Shirley.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: welcome back Martin|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi Shirley|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Thanks Lukas|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hi Martin:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: we were finishing a very interesting hand in main club (which I rarely play) |pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi Rashid|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: seems to be an easy 2@h contract for S|pg||
nt|shevek: 2@c = both Majors I assume|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: i guess, 2@c is for the majors|pg||
nt|dimi: yes|pg||
pc|c3|nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|caitlin: not sure what his options would be|pg||
nt|dimi: For details of the current standing please check the liveticker: http://www.merlin-liveticker.de/bgt_2010/10_05_14_wer.html|pg||
pc|c8|nt|shevek: west nailed partner, 3@h would've been enough imo|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|h3|nt|caitlin: other than slam|pg||
pc|h2|nt|h_karluk: 4@s could be a cheery bid, but no more|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|mcarroll: And it nearly resulted in a pretty hopeless @S contract|pg||
pc|c6|nt|rnmalik: yes 2@D was passed and you had 5:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes you saw it |pg||
nt|sybarra: 5 to the 9 spot |pg||
nt|rnmalik: true|pg||
nt|dimi: 4@h is 1 down ...5@d 2 down i think |pg||
pc|cK|nt|dimi: yes Nicoleta|pg||
nt|shevek: north also bid too much with such a flat hand|pg||
nt|shevek: 10 losers|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cT|pg||
nt|mcarroll: However EW came to the rescue|pg||
nt|caitlin: which is making here|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hQ|nt|vugraphzkk: I agree with you, Martin...|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|pg||
pc|h6|nt|shevek: so north changed +50 into -100|pg||
nt|dimi: some kibs pointed out that 4@h has good practical chances if they dont lead clubs|pg||
pc|h9|nt|caitlin: but hard for South to know this|pg||
pc|hT|pc|d2|pg||
pc|h5|pc|s4|pc|h8|pc|c4|pg||
pc|d3|nt|h_karluk: so far a good way by th declarer|pg||
nt|shevek: we'll never know now :)|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dK|pc|d9|pg||
nt|sybarra: Is there a team called  "die Musketiere" ?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: declarer has to hope trumps are not 4-1|pg||
nt|rnmalik: that solves the 2 @S loser problem.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: yes, its Hartmut Kondoch with Felix Zimmermann, with two French Juniors|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.merlin-liveticker.de/bgt_2010/10_05_14_wer.html|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c7|nt|h_karluk: almost surely a good spot|pg||

nt|vugraphzkk: Hello GÃ¡bor, hello Roland!|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|cicus: hello Lukas|pg||
mb|1H|nt|cicus: will N X 3@C or bid 3NT?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sybarra: ty for german lesson,  I needed it..|pg||
nt|cicus: I'd X|pg||
mb|3H|nt|h_karluk: 22/18 and basicly disappointmenr altho void @d|pg||
nt|mcarroll: me too|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: *disappointment|pg||
mb|4C|nt|h_karluk: could count as another brave recognizition by S and W|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: dont hesitate to ask, if you have any questions :)|pg||
nt|xenya: almost classic 3@H by W   |pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|nt|caitlin: hear 3@D then 3N?|pg||
nt|cicus: no, then pass|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello all and hello Nicoleta |pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: few @Ds and only a single stopper makes 3NT unattractive|pg||
nt|cicus: let alone some missing HCP's|pg||
nt|caitlin: yes:)|pg||
nt|caitlin: this stage of declarer play is MOST important: the planning|pg||
nt|cicus: now W can take a ruff but the losing @C can be discarded on the 4th spade later|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: can he guess, that @s3 is a single?|pg||
nt|caitlin: I also would not bid 3N, but wondered if North would|pg||
nt|dimi: a lot of bidding with those flat hands|pg||
nt|shevek: south's turn to have the "ugly" hand|pg||
mb|4H|nt|h_karluk: x and xx , don't ask me i am new at the town:)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: well judged auction - making plus 1 probably |pg||
nt|shevek: yes flat hands all around|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: allright xx removed|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Losing 2 @H and a @C|pg||
nt|mcarroll: meanwhile, this 3NT does not look like making|pg||
nt|sybarra: "we" might be a trick or so short here|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 26 hcp but with @S lead, this contract does not make.|pg||
nt|shevek: hi shirley, everyone |pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: hi all, welcome|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: should not be difficult to guess @Ds i think...|pg||
nt|caitlin: seems right to me to play low|pg||
nt|sybarra: wonder if N could find the club lead?  no |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: not sure much makes on the 3 level |pg||
nt|xenya: wrong!|pg||
pc|sA|nt|h_karluk: which is fine as well|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: i just wanted to shock you ;-)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: always difficult, when you have no long suits to use|pg||
nt|shevek: this is a hand where everyone should defend :)|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|sybarra: hello again Lukas|pg||
pc|s2|nt|shevek: re Lukas|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|h_karluk: teehee, Lukas merci for poor hamdi:)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: *mercy|pg||
nt|mcarroll: needda to be careful not to block the@Ss|pg||
nt|sybarra: and the minor suits nmot friendly either |pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: i think its not so difficult to see :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: W can see and count 12 cards in @S|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes|pg||
nt|mcarroll: true my fault for trying to multi-task, trying to keep an eye on Monaco qualifying|pg||
nt|cicus: E could have played a small @S here but it does not help as he has only 1 @C|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|nt|vugraphpl6: ]|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|shevek: I agree with stopping in 2NT with 25hcp in two flat hands (am I old fashioned? )|pg||
nt|sybarra: trying to entice W to think clubs are breaking with play of J|pg||
pc|hA|nt|h_karluk: you know another busy week on BBO vugraph theatre, anyways nice humorous approaches are always inside crew, cool:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: yes, for me it was also very busy in the last few days... but i like the job, its also a lot of fun :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 2nd double could be optional <on some rare CC> as they knew spades their suit|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|nt|h_karluk: that's great, i cannot wait my shift ends to have a cold beer :P|pg||
nt|cicus: now S must resist the temptation to take a fnesse against @DJ|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|xenya: maybe it was not so easy after all |pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hT|pc|h6|pc|h8|pg||
nt|sybarra: likely to try club hook and go down quikly |pg||
nt|jcmax: Hmmm. is it just a 1-day tournament?|pg||
nt|jcmax: sry folks...|pg||
nt|sybarra: hi Sabine,  you are always welcome |pg||
nt|rnmalik: It was -1 and now in an effort to make it would be -2.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: no this Tournament goes from Friday till Sunday|pg||
nt|sybarra: from earlier explanation I saw,  the round robin, moves folks up and down the ranks|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: many Teams, who played the Bonn Nations Cup at Wednesday/Thursday stayed here to play the German Trophy too|pg||
pc|d2|nt|h_karluk: 1st doubles are mostly t/o|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: Round Robin was just at the beginning of the Tournament, now they play Swiss System|pg||
nt|rnmalik: So by the end of the day we have 4 top teams. Am I right?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: they play in 3 groups, and always after some rounds there come 2/3 teams into the lower group/better group|pg||
nt|caitlin: if he does, he is definitely down|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: now he is reading in the convention card, maybe it helps for his decission...|pg||
nt|caitlin: or count on hand but hard to know if third seat 3@C is 6 or 7 card suit|pg||
nt|cicus: west may be 1327|pg||
pc|d9|nt|h_karluk: unless they start with a level more than 4|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|caitlin: a clue is that East did not return club, trying to set one up|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|xenya: now he needs to get hearts right to limit the losses|pg||
nt|shevek: maybe only 7 tricks now|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dT|nt|sfoxa:  Is Hungarian "Winkiboy" named after their lead - Winkler? I suppose|pg||
nt|xenya: so 3@H was makeable|pg||
mc|12|nt|sybarra: I do not like the 2 @S bid,  (not resulting hand) but seems a bit much |pg||
nt|caitlin: oh well, understandable from declarer's point of view|pg||
nt|cicus: I can't say this was not percentage play, although what if west has only 6 clubs?|pg||
nt|cicus: is that prohibited when vulnerable?|pg||

nt|dimi: makes no difference anyway|pg||
nt|shevek: even 25 pts didn't help - the lack of a long suit (source of tricks)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: in board 9 they passed all, although 4@h possible on N/S|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: not a good score for Israel i think|pg||
nt|shevek: surprised south passed in 3rd with 13 count|pg||
nt|sybarra: me too!|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: 13 with 5card major should be enough...|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  oh - 20-20 points hand|pg||
mb|2H|an|weak|nt|h_karluk: mebbe 1N rite now|pg||
nt|sybarra: and he opens this dreg in 1st seat |pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: oh darnit, commentator's curse..lol|pg||
nt|sybarra: "gambling" |pg||

nt|xenya: N can overcall 1N now -- will E compete?|pg||
nt|xenya: yes he did|pg||
mb|3H|nt|xenya:  2@C sounds artificial -- probably a form of stayman  |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|caitlin: Ten of hearts sure looked like doubleton thus we know 1@S and 2@H thus could then be 3@D 7@C|pg||

nt|xenya: but i think i know what his double means...|pg||
nt|xenya: *second double|pg||
pc|c6|nt|shevek: good contract|pg||

nt|caitlin: yes|pg||
nt|caitlin: certainly not by vul:)|pg||
nt|cicus: if anything , he should have tries 3NT, the most probable game, where 5th spade may be worth the 9th trick|pg||

nt|xenya: i think NS fully deserve this score -- mind you, EW have done nothing nothing silly |pg||

mb|p|nt|shevek: just when I was about to say he's likely to misguess the @ss :)|pg||
nt|shevek: south opened after all...|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|nt|h_karluk: yes, we call him so, that's great:)|pg||

nt|jtr: There it is|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: ok, so next board... :)|pg||
mb|3S|an|weak|nt|sfoxa:  and that looks like partscore, rather for EW |pg||
nt|cicus: sry no, if E switches to clubs it goes down|pg||
nt|shevek: I think in bd 9 south miscounted his points|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: 10 imps for miscounting, thats expensive...|pg||
mb|4H|nt|sfoxa:  but let's see|pg||
mb|4S|mb|5H|nt|cicus: and then West switches back to @Ds|pg||
nt|cicus: tough defence, though|pg||
nt|sybarra: looking at 9 even N would be opened by some |pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: I think at least 1 down|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  they manage to find better fit|pg||
nt|shevek: it's ok, they have good team mates who made 3NT in bd 10|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: 9 tricks are easy here...|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: and the club lead will not hurt declarer |pg||
nt|sybarra: or can N find another lead?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: 4@h seems to be possible|pg||
nt|xenya: a disheartening start for Israel|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|rnmalik: 4@H makeable but many ifs and buts-good stop anyway.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: Sorry forgot auction did not finish with 1NT|pg||
nt|dimi: EW have to locate Q of @c to make|pg||
mb|p|pc|cT|pc|c5|nt|vugraphzkk: 4@s = no major|pg||
pc|c6|nt|sfoxa:  still, you are right - at least 1 down, rather 2 )))|pg||
nt|mcarroll: And unfortunately they managed to overcook the auction, the 3 level was best|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: one down also in 4@c...|pg||
pc|cK|pg||

nt|sybarra: well the lead was also helpful |pg||
nt|sybarra: hi:)   welcome |pg||
nt|rnmalik: hi|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: welcome Fridrik|pg||
nt|caitlin: interesting that board 10, 3@D down here, open room N-S in 3N with very different bidding 1Nby North 2C by South and clubs doubled by West rather than 3C opener...weak notrump by ...|pg||
nt|caitlin: North|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dA|nt|vugraphzkk: *1@s, sorry|pg||
nt|cicus: with @SA, @S finesse, then @D finesse and clearing @Ds this can be made|pg||
nt|cicus: I can see nothing more to play for|pg||
nt|shevek: true, I guess declarer will postpone playing @cs|pg||
pc|d2|nt|caitlin: nor I...seems like 'normal' bridge play:)|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|sybarra: if Pard was going to pickle my @H trick why not lead it  (says S)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Such friendly defense:)|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s5|pc|sK|nt|cicus: W found another plan: Hx in clubs with N|pg||
nt|cicus: however, this brings in 3 club tricks only if the x is te 9|pg||
nt|shevek: that was pretty bold :)|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  agree with -1, yes|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hm essentially finessing against the (9 of trrump|pg||
pc|c8|nt|xenya: but maybe this hand will give them a break -- S didn't find a @C switch |pg||
pc|c2|pc|h3|nt|shevek: of course winning the 10 was a clue|pg||
nt|dimi: yes|pg||
nt|shevek: maybe north should have played the @sA :)|pg||
nt|shevek: to be fair, looking at the movie, NS misdefended 3NT in bd 10|pg||

nt|vugraphzkk: yes... there was nothing more to take for the defense...|pg||
nt|caitlin: good defense|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: one down is the most important fact ;-)|pg||
nt|cicus: now E has the big hand and W the 4-pointer|pg||
nt|dimi: some distribution monster now :)|pg||
nt|shevek: now for more unbalanced hands|pg||
nt|shevek: no fits, best to defend in this one :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: is the a who gets to 1 nt first hand?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: really very strange, why east just didnt want to claim here... I dont think such good players throw away the wrong card...|pg||
nt|shevek: EW might even make it|pg||
mb|1N|nt|shevek: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: better|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|jtr: Evet|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @C by N?|pg||
nt|sybarra: think we missed a pass  |pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: 2 imps to Winkiboy on 2 -- same contract but declarer took 8 tricks |pg||
nt|dimi: i think 6@s by W is on|pg||
nt|dimi: by E a @c lead will beat|pg||
mb|3C!|mb|p|nt|xenya: did N really double here?|pg||
nt|shevek: tell them Lukas :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|friggi: agree|pg||
nt|friggi: that is more like it:)|pg||
nt|xenya: he has a pure yarborough|pg||
nt|xenya: but he also has 3 hearts in support for partner|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphpl2: we had some problems with connections or so, now we're back:)|pg||
nt|cicus: 3@S must be a transfer to 3NT|pg||
pc|h5|nt|caitlin: yes|pg||
pc|h6|nt|jtr: 3NT needs some work|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i admit was indeed disciplined as David wisely pointed out|pg||
nt|xenya: maybe that accounts for it? |pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: yes|pg||
nt|cicus: then they probably play 3NT rsponse as some self-dangerous artificial bid :)|pg||
nt|shevek: pity it's wrongsided|pg||
pc|hK|nt|sfoxa:  S is happy to show both - maximum overcall and @h with his DBL|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|h_karluk: maybe with little defense, we ll see|pg||
nt|jtr: I am sure Salvo will find a way|pg||
nt|h_karluk: is he a magician, i thought i am alone:)|pg||
nt|jtr: @d to the 7 at trick 2 i guess|pg||
nt|xenya: so N didn't psyche at adverse vulnerability after all :)|pg||
nt|shevek: hmmm|pg||
nt|sybarra: 1 was ok,  2 is certainly mor difficult |pg||
pc|s9|nt|jtr: Not at all  Lovely guy too|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  seems, N wasn't sure about @h|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 @S is puppet,  saying I have 4 @H |pg||
pc|sJ|nt|rnmalik: 3NT-top 10 tricks.|pg||
nt|sybarra: this will make in a breeze |pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: forgetting one pass makes everybody confused :-D|pg||
nt|friggi: yes 2NT should be 23-24|pg||
nt|shevek: maybe cuebidding would have been better|pg||
nt|dimi: 3@s was forcing?|pg||
nt|shevek: didn't think so|pg||
pc|sK|nt|xenya: on 3 NS in the other room stopped in a quiet 1N making -- 12 imps to Winkiboy |pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|xenya: NS*|pg||
pc|sT|nt|sybarra: 4 hts pretty easy also |pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|nt|jtr: OK This worked better|pg||
nt|dimi: a kip told me it would be forcing ... hmmm|pg||
nt|shevek: 7 certain tricks , one will come from @d or @c|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|shevek: even so, BW with a void wouldn't be recommended|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: for W 3@s is forcing, but they dont agree about this bid|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c8|nt|dimi: right Nicoleta|pg||
pc|c4|nt|h_karluk: i have to be objective and impartial, however "gl sahib" :) (friendly code between I and him since long years)|pg||
nt|shevek: aha|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|cK|nt|sybarra: just a bit messier |pg||
nt|friggi: like 3NT better|pg||
nt|cicus: S has to return @Ds to cut dummy off its @S10|pg||
nt|cicus: @S9  , I mean|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c5|nt|xenya: i wish i knew the meaning of all those bids, but the final contract is almost perfect |pg||
nt|xenya: 4@S was a fair alternative of course|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|mcarroll: But as it turns out, @D play better, the 4-1 @H split would make a @H contract at the 3 level a major problem|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes but given the 4/4 fit at the table we probably all select 4 @H |pg||
nt|shevek: is north considering a duck here?|pg||
nt|shevek: after all north wouldn't have a clue that west holds 6@hs :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: if so, East gets an overtrick...|pg||
nt|dimi: can't believe ... maybe on his way to bar?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|friggi: truth but that bidding is overrated given that you miss a lot of Aces:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: easy for us to second guess from this altitude |pg||
nt|shevek: here...|pg||
pc|h7|nt|cicus: well, not necessary, as E has only 8 tricks anyway|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jtr: kinderleicht ein Kinderspiel|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h8|nt|vugraphzkk: if you play like this in brd 12, you tell the opponents: "I think you are stupid" ...|pg||
pc|c3|nt|h_karluk: logical line|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|s5|nt|caitlin: West was overly optomistic, for sure|pg||
nt|cicus: oops, now S can be endplayed into leading away from @CK|pg||
nt|cicus: could have unblocked @HQ|pg||
nt|caitlin: should have|pg||
nt|cicus: even|pg||
nt|cicus: he knew N had solid @Hs|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: If Ron Pachtmann will use this option? We will see...|pg||
nt|caitlin: the @HJ by North showed a good sequence of T9 as well |pg||
nt|caitlin: does he know he has an endplay?|pg||

nt|shevek: now for a 12-card fit...|pg||
nt|sybarra: over drove it |pg||
mb|1H|nt|dimi: i think 11 tricks in @s is the limit for NS|pg||
mb|1S|nt|dimi: 9 tricks for EW in @d|pg||
mb|d|nt|h_karluk: with running diamonds and H AK, pity not much woth West|pg||
nt|h_karluk: *with|pg||
nt|cicus: a lot of duplicated values here for NS, can they avoid slam?|pg||
nt|caitlin: board 2 where N-S stopped in 3@D, open room 3N down 6 for 11 IMPs. only score on table thus far|pg||
nt|sybarra: and an easy 4 @H here |pg||
nt|shevek: it has been an accident in bd 11 (worth 11 imps)|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe many long days of playing contributing |pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|jtr: 1NT for me|pg||
nt|h_karluk: balanced seat|pg||
nt|h_karluk: good guess boss|pg||
nt|xenya: on 4, the Israeli NS went for a 5@D save against 4@H -- phantom in theory, but fine in practice -- 9 imps to Israel|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|h_karluk: sorta biz X, shld work now|pg||
nt|jtr: Pushy double will work here|pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 20 the other room used a smolen type sequence to get to game |pg||
nt|xenya: good 3@S by S -- lead directing -- just in case|pg||
nt|xenya: he is prepared to sacrifice in clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: ah, @D finesse taken there as well?|pg||
mb|p|nt|caitlin: 2@C is catch all for game force|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: but maybe W would have done better if he'd just bid 3N? |pg||
nt|xenya: tough for W now i think -- may easily go wrong|pg||
nt|caitlin: yes|pg||
nt|caitlin: and then West ran his clubs|pg||
pc|s2|nt|h_karluk: ditto |pg||
nt|mcarroll: Again the 4-4 minor fit is found|pg||
nt|shevek: probably a claim at T2...|pg||
nt|dimi: yes |pg||
pc|s3|pc|sK|nt|tomi2:  somebody knows the meaning of 3@C? maybe a transfer to @D?|pg||
nt|sybarra: this could test declarer |pg||
nt|rnmalik: that should have been bid. It is always better to bid vul game. |pg||
nt|friggi: sure it will|pg||
nt|friggi: but he has to play for AK in west|pg||
nt|cicus: the first sign of misfitting values, the @C cue-bid|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|shevek: we expect a claim at T2|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe trick 4 |pg||

pc|sA|nt|rnmalik: nothing is working for him-bad distribution.|pg||
nt|friggi: if not he is doomed from the start|pg||
nt|sybarra: nothing breaks well for him on this hand|pg||
pc|s5|nt|caitlin: 5@H leads to slam|pg||
nt|cicus: 5%H asked S to bid slam if... if what?|pg||
nt|caitlin: and the 2@D bid by South|pg||
nt|cicus: 5@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: 5@h just invitational|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|cicus: a @D cue may have been more helpful for South to diagnose the wasted values|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c6|nt|friggi: regardless he has to make a go at it:)|pg||
nt|xenya: W did well to double but for some reason E pulled|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|caitlin: yes and with very minimal hand, no extra features than South has shown, surprising 6@H|pg||
nt|dimi: no claim?|pg||
nt|sybarra: NOT ruffing low on this one |pg||
pc|c3|pg||

nt|shevek: good dbl by west|pg||
mb|3N!|nt|jtr: Was 1@s conventional?|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2:  did he upgrade this 17 hcp to 18? or do they have other nt ranges?|pg||
nt|shevek: that says: not so keen for you to lead one pd |pg||
nt|shevek: undo pls|pg||
nt|shevek: Lukas?  :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: the double means: I have a better idea than the @s lead...|pg||
nt|shevek: south bid 3@d in OR and made it easy |pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: my wife's origin is Donegal, and personally i love Ireland :) all neighbors around property near the sweet pond are here also Irish origin@H|pg||
nt|jtr: It might get awkward otherwise|pg||
nt|shevek: yes, that what I meant :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: ahh could be conventional, kinda xfer with weakish values|pg||
nt|jtr: Oh really? We are close to Donegal|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that's nice, all anchestors and relatives still there:) seriously|pg||
nt|jtr: 1@s denies a major probably|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is not good in short team match |pg||
nt|shevek: there goes 10 imps|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: 3NT are no problem here|pg||
nt|shevek: the only problem was to bid it :)|pg||
pc|s6|nt|xenya: all those spade pips work too|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Walddk7: Right, you don't count hcp for @S1098, but they are worth gold|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: because he definitely wanted to play in @h suit|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|jtr: oh ok|pg||
pc|sK|pg||

nt|friggi: yes for game - fast arrival prinsip|pg||
pc|d5|nt|tomi2:  this helped them to find this good game|pg||

nt|shevek: now this contract has no play on ANY lead|pg||
pc|dK|nt|h_karluk: tx lukas for alert|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|sfoxa:  http://www.german-bridge-trophy.de/ - for results, but non-on-line|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sybarra: on in 3 @D so playing this to make |pg||
pc|c3|nt|jtr: I wonder how they show @ds|pg||
nt|cicus: this could even make one day but not today|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|jtr: Maybe they dont bother|pg||
nt|drewsky: not me...4 trip 3 , only 15 HCP, and my free 2@S bis clarifies 3+ as well|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c6|nt|dimi: can hold it to 1 down|pg||
nt|shevek: argument at the table Lukas?  :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: south has claimed, but now he say he doesnt claimed|pg||
nt|shevek: yes, @ds don't run|pg||
nt|dimi: a kib said @h now, then it's 2 down i think|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: because east says, he wants one more...|pg||
nt|shevek: only one??|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: and now we have TD at table|pg||
nt|shevek: after claim declarer is not allowed to take any finesses|pg||
nt|dimi: NS hve enough tricks, it's only one down|pg||
nt|yuval10: one more seems reasonable, when S play K@d and see that W doesn't have any, he overtake in dummy and loses 1 for a claim|pg||
nt|dimi: yes|pg||
nt|shevek: guess he overtakes @d|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: and now we have -3|pg||
nt|shevek: true true|pg||
pc|c7|nt|h_karluk: that's th question -- how to show @d|pg||

nt|h_karluk: woohoo:)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: excellent analogy:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: he explained after the 3@c bid, so then it was clear with the @c's...|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Clubs behaving or a squeeze for the 12th|pg||

nt|vugraphzkk: thanks too|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  for Bonn Nationa Cup, there were on-line scores. and what about this tournamnet?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: there are also online scores|pg||
nt|yuval10: it's a matter of imp anyway - -17 instead of -16|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: 4@h is a good sacrifice against 3NT|pg||
nt|vugraphpl6: S explained,that N had 5 @H|pg||
nt|vugraphpl6: but only one trick left:)|pg||
nt|vugraphpl6: friendly match:)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|yuval10: 2@d multy here|pg||
nt|xenya: somewhat unexpectedly, the match is almost even -- it did look as though Winkiboy had an upper hand |pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|nt|cicus: so a useful win for Turkey|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: A wild one too|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  http://www.merlin-liveticker.de/bgt_2010/10_05_14_wer.html - these ones, t.y.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: yes|pg||
nt|shevek: allowed 2@s, 2@h,  @d and 2@c only|pg||
nt|dimi: last board for this set|pg||
nt|shevek: 3@d|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure that is easy to find |pg||
mb|2S|nt|yuval10: they missed chances in board 4 and 5|pg||
nt|cicus: this board is not going to alter the result|pg||
nt|cicus: N has a 3@H bid in my opinion|pg||
nt|cicus: and S will carry on to game|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: well, i think board 14 will bring some IMPs for Israel|pg||
nt|cicus: N has to filler cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: and this is easy |pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: 2@h is more often 5 than 6 cards...|pg||
nt|yuval10: both should've been a pickup for Winklboy team and turned into minus|pg||
mb|4S|nt|tomi2:  seems they also use transfers after 1@C-x|pg||
nt|xenya: yes|pg||
nt|cicus: two*|pg||
nt|shevek: not as easy as the previous board, true|pg||
mb|p|nt|caitlin: obviously 2N here is hearts and minor|pg||
nt|cicus: S is overbidding now|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: hearts and clubs|pg||
nt|cicus: as 3@H was not forcing, he should have settled for game|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: 2NT = @h+@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzkk: but sometimes it doesnt work :(|pg||
nt|caitlin: ty|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: in this board the computer says that 3NT are makeable|pg||
nt|shevek: similar in a way|pg||
nt|sybarra: last bd of this set,  thx again Lukas. Great job!|pg||
nt|sybarra: hmmmm|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: they even didnt find 3NT, so no decision problem for S|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2:  that 4333 8 count with no king and ace and no heart stopper wouldnt be my favorite hand for 1nt facing a partner who could be "light on classic shape"|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx also to Nicoleta,  great to be with you again |pg||

nt|shevek: great job Lukas|pg||

nt|mcarroll: Open Room is slowere than here, but all the scores so far have beento the Hungarian team|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: last board for this round|pg||
nt|mcarroll: and 3NT should make|pg||
nt|vugraphzkk: seems, that Hungary will win this fight...|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Declarer has 2@H, 3@S 3 minor tricks and N will be endplayed to give the 9th|pg||

nt|shevek: I think we had a late start this match though shirley|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|sybarra: thx to Lukas our terrific operator |pg||
nt|xenya: now this is a really good lesson never get disheartened by a bad result: your counterparts in the other room may do equally badly|pg||
pc|sA|nt|sybarra: yes  we did |pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|pg||
nt|cicus: yes, Lukas, bd 14 may bring in a handful of IMPs for Israel, if they can cope with the hand|pg||

mb|1S|nt|Walddk2: Slam is terrible, even for me|pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: off 1 key and the queen of trumps|pg||
nt|gebeceli: hope they will not be effected from previous board and play this slam|pg||
nt|vugraphpl6: this match is first time,in which players know score after each board:)|pg||
mb|2C|nt|vugraphpl2: CR - @dA and ruff|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 4@H by Gierulski is some bid|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: But it worked|pg||
nt|robinswr: splinter is not going to make north happy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Heart shortness won't excite North|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|nt|robinswr: however south with good trumps will bid again|pg||
nt|gebeceli: 7   ??????|pg||
mb|5N|nt|vugraphpl6: it's an experiment|pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: i guess not|pg||
mb|6C|nt|Walddk2: 12 or 13 IMPs to Mragowia. We have a match!|pg||
nt|gebeceli: now   7|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphpl6: I think so|pg||

mb|1D|nt|Walddk2: Redeal please (if you can)|pg||
mb|1H|nt|gebeceli: this line of playing seems a bit risky...... declarer could make to 4-0 break at clubs......what if W had 4 clubs....he should come to hand with @D|pg||
nt|vugraphpl6: true|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Would you double with the North cards, Steve?|pg||

nt|Walddk2: What a shame|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Contract I mean|pg||
nt|robinswr: if he had doubled 1diamond, then he could bid spades over partner's strong bid|pg||
nt|gebeceli: S should immediately switch yo @S..when he has his @CJ|pg||
