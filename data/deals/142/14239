mb|1H|mb|d|nt|flash: they're playing board 8 in the Closed Room now; we'll keep an eye on the scoreboard for changes|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|starkist: wow|pg||
nt|starkist: thats not a gurl bid ;)|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|5D|nt|starkist: 5h|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: Nick just asking Dan some Qs...|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|starkist: nick liked his def i guess|pg||
pc|c5|nt|flash: for those just joining us, we started with 23 teams and played a full round-robin of 10-board matches|pg||
nt|starkist: not for long|pg||
nt|flash: the top 8 teams qualified for the KO phase|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c7|pc|cT|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d7|pg||
nt|flash: so, particularly for the teams playing 4-handed, this has been a long haul|pg||
pc|d2|pc|h2|pc|dT|pc|d5|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h3|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: giving up a @S|pg||
mc|11|pg||
qx|c3|st||md|1ST732H9632D7C9764,SQ5H5DQJT843CKT82,SA984HAQJT87DK5C5,SKJ6HK4DA962CAQJ3|sv|e|mb|p|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|1N|nt|lml: so east west would like to be in five of a minor.  It may be hard now|pg||
nt|buffytvs: especially if Ross takes a bid here|pg||
mb|2H|mb|3C!|an|transfer|nt|buffytvs: presumably that's a txfr|pg||
nt|lml: yes|pg||
nt|lml: I am sure it is|pg||
nt|guppy: well - 3N is even better than than 5m and Piotr found the winning initial action (1N vs. X) to steer them there|pg||
nt|lml: 5@H is a decent save or 5@C|pg||
mb|4H|nt|lml: 5@D|pg||
nt|lml: either|pg||
nt|buffytvs: tough call for East now|pg||
nt|lml: With those trump I bet he bids on|pg||
nt|lml: if partner has diamonds it looks like he only has 2.5 losers|pg||
nt|buffytvs: a full 18 with a diamond fit, but does he want to commit to 11 tricks?|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|lml: well that will be a steal then|pg||
nt|buffytvs: thgouht he might dbl|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: I think he should bid|pg||
pc|cA|nt|lml: if partner has nothing else he has good diamonds|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c2|pc|c5|pg||
nt|buffytvs: avoiding the Elvis Coup in diamonds, which as it happens, doesn't cost|pg||
nt|lml: maybe he didnt think clubs was a transfer|pg||
nt|buffytvs: he had even better clubs|pg||
nt|lml: otherwise that is sort of a strange lead|pg||
nt|buffytvs: what would you have led from his hand?|pg||
nt|lml: the elvis coup|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: keith is looking for some high cards|pg||
nt|buffytvs: me too|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c6|pc|c8|nt|buffytvs: there's a 10 :)|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h2|pc|h5|pg||
nt|lml: fortunately he doesnt need to get to dummy|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pc|h3|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|lml: 2@H over 1NT doesnt have to show much but Taylor's hand was less than not much|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c7|pc|cT|pc|h7|pg||
nt|lml: now Piotrk nows the diamond position|pg||
nt|lml: and the club position and the heart position....|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d7|pc|d3|pg||
nt|lml: so this is a potential pickup for Korbel |pg||
pc|d2|pc|h6|pc|d4|pc|d5|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|nt|buffytvs: yes - but it wouldn't shock me if they pushed the board|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c9|pc|cK|pc|h8|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I think it's hard to bid 5@D EW|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sK|pc|s3|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|lml: I was asked if it was common to bid with zero points... no|pg||
mc|8|nt|lml: but with the notrump bid he wasn't showing more than a few|pg||
nt|buffytvs: but South is limtied since he didn't double the 1NT overcall|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I thought he might even bid 3@H|pg||
nt|lml: yes and the diamond singleton and four trump count as dummy points|pg||
nt|lml: 3@H would have been my choice|pg||
nt|lml: that for sure shows nothing|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: director call  one side was not alerted to the transfer|pg||
nt|buffytvs: however he has to be careful -- he doesn't want to push the opponents into something like a slam when he has no defence|pg||
nt|guppy: N/S will be delighted with that result....|pg||
nt|lml: there can be no redress for north south they already got blood|pg||
nt|buffytvs: don't see that a non-alert affected anything|pg||
pg||

mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1D|mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|starkist: making 5nt would have been par :)|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: which cue bid was question with north hand|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|starkist: still can't believe that 4@h bid |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: perhaps 2@C would have been natural|pg||
nt|flash: 'standard' uses the cheaper cue-bid to show 3-card support and the dearer one to show 4-card support?|pg||
pc|cK|nt|fabsayc: but 2@H i simply dont understand|pg||
nt|starkist: 6 loser facing a limit|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c9|pc|d4|pg||

nt|caitlin: yes a length point|pg||
pg||

nt|lml: that reaffirms my view that Piotrk may have thought it was clubs|pg||
mb|1C|an|alert|nt|buffytvs: true|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: Piotr|pg||
mb|1D!|an|0-6|nt|lml: I can see no reason for any penalty... they got it all..|pg||
nt|guppy: his choice of opening lead (@cA) also strongly suggested same|pg||
mb|1H|nt|lml: yes we discussed that a while ago|pg||
nt|lml: but welcome :)|pg||
mb|2C|mb|2N!|an|good 4 card raise|mb|p|nt|lml: I guess 2NT shows a heart raise of some sort|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: thanks !|pg||
mb|p|pc|cK|nt|buffytvs: the C!A is a disappointment to declarer -- it's a trick, but he'd far rather have the @DK for example|pg||
nt|buffytvs: @CA|pg||
nt|lml: true but there is enough to work with in dummy|pg||
nt|buffytvs: oh yes|pg||
nt|lml: this may take a while though|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c9|pc|h3|pg||
nt|buffytvs: he could play this as a dummy reversal|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|pc|h2|pc|h5|pg||
nt|lml: I think he will just set up diamonds|pg||
nt|lml: probably about now|pg||
nt|buffytvs: seems simplest|pg||
pc|hK|pc|c7|pc|h7|pc|h9|pg||
nt|lml: definitely about now!|pg||
nt|buffytvs: he might well guess the diamond position seeing the 9 fall|pg||
nt|lml: I am certain he will guess the position but I am usually wrong|pg||
nt|lml: he knows the spade honors are likely split and Piotr has 0-6 so there isnt much room for diamond honors|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d9|pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
pc|d3|nt|buffytvs: yes -- good point about the spades|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d4|pc|dK|pg||
nt|buffytvs: as predicted|pg||

nt|buffytvs: now things are pretty straightforward|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|lml: yes he could claim if he wants to|pg||
nt|lml: I claim!|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c8|pc|s2|pg||
pc|c4|nt|buffytvs: ruff the diamond high, return with a trump, give up the last two spades|pg||
pc|c5|pc|h4|pc|c3|pg||
pc|d5|pc|s6|pc|h8|pc|d7|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hT|nt|lml: well a trump to hand cash a diamond ruff a diamond seems the easiest|pg||
pc|hQ|mc|10|nt|lml: but it all works|pg||
pg||

nt|starkist: and that was facing a ragtag limit|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|vugraphzjs: judy was not pleased at all with that last hand|pg||
nt|flash: 2NT to show range/balanced hand??|pg||

mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|flash: well done|pg||
nt|starkist: nicely|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dJ|nt|caitlin: 2NT here shows balanced 18-19 HCP and also gives partner a choice|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d8|pg||
pc|d7|nt|fabsayc: will make because of need to keep south off lead|pg||
nt|starkist: I used to think soloway just didn't want to raise me, but saw him do that with other ;)|pg||
nt|po-s: how does it give a choice? does it show four spades as well?|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dQ|nt|caitlin: not necessarily|pg||

pc|d5|pc|d9|pc|s6|pc|dK|pg||

pc|s3|pc|s5|pc|sT|pc|sJ|pg||
mc|8|nt|fabsayc: wow, i give up on predicting|pg||
nt|caitlin: did he lose track of spades?|pg||
nt|flash: the current strain of Commentators' Curse is quite potent...|pg||
pg||

mb|1C!|nt|lml: Piotr has a nice hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: you know how I feel about aces|pg||
nt|buffytvs: going to behard to avoid 3NT, but not sure you can get to 9 tricks|pg||
mb|1S!|an|nat 7+|mb|p|nt|lml: yeah I think they can make 3NT anyway|pg||
nt|buffytvs: but the spades are friendly, as long as you don't play Restricted Choice|pg||
nt|lml: as long as they guess spades|pg||
mb|2D|an|gf somewhere|nt|lml: the key is to cash the ace first|pg||
nt|buffytvs: if you don[t guess spades, you may be struggling|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: now will these two 4-3-3-3 hands avoid the spade fit|pg||
mb|2H|an|7-9 art|nt|buffytvs: he's oging to get a diamond lead, and will take the inference that North is likely to have longer spades, and play a spade to the king (I think)|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|buffytvs: then he may well go wrong|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: guess you cant|pg||
nt|buffytvs: neitehr deterred by the 4333 shape|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|lml: he is going to need some help from his friends|pg||
nt|buffytvs: but 10 tricks in spades are even more difficult than 9 in NT on this deal|pg||
nt|lml: well the heart lead didnt hurt him|pg||
nt|buffytvs: yes -- Keith avoided the club lead|pg||
nt|lml: if he guesses spades there might be some sort of endplay|pg||
nt|buffytvs: which would blow a trick|pg||
nt|lml: so how can you make it|pg||
nt|buffytvs: strip hearts, draw trumps, and play a diamond, hoping North ducks?|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|pc|h3|pg||
nt|buffytvs: then he has to give a ruff-sluff or play clubs, which would be enough|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|pc|h4|pc|h5|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hQ|pc|h2|pc|h8|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I think Keith is too good a player to be caught that way though|pg||
nt|lml: well he is doing the strip hearts part|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|lml: that always shows the Q|pg||
nt|lml: I learned that a long time ago from Mary Paul|pg||
nt|buffytvs: yes i think he'll figure out the spade position|pg||
nt|lml: nobody would lead the jack in that situation unless they had the queen|pg||
nt|lml: it is an oldie|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|sA|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sQ|pc|sK|pc|s5|pg||
nt|lml: he can do it|pg||

nt|lml: out a diamond|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s6|nt|lml: he wins and plays 3 rounds of clubs|pg||
pc|s4|nt|lml: north is in|pg||
nt|lml: and done|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|lml: well he is going to have to play diamonds anyways|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|buffytvs: true -- needs to figure out the exact distribution|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d8|pc|d6|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dT|pc|dQ|nt|buffytvs: which he didn't|pg||
nt|lml: off track|pg||
nt|lml: but who can blame him|pg||
mc|9|nt|buffytvs: only works if North is exactly 4-2 in the minors with both club honours|pg||
