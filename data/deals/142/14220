nt|davidstern: So I am expecting some good bridge here|pg||
nt|buffytvs: yes -- that was comment on the Seniors Final tomorrow though :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|davidstern: :)|pg||
nt|davidstern: If w opesn 1NT|pg||
nt|lml: I think this is one of the tables to watch for sure|pg||
mb|1C|nt|davidstern: And N/S have majro takeout they will find spades|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|buffytvs: but 4@S seems very ambitious|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidstern: But South opening has set the ball in motion|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidstern: Did North really Pass|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|davidstern: I would bid on the North hand|pg||
nt|lml: once the opponents bid 1NT you cannot bid again|pg||
pc|h3|nt|buffytvs: is that in the rules?|pg||
nt|lml: didn't your bridge teacher tell you that|pg||
nt|davidstern: If my bridge teacher taught me that I would apply for a refund|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|lml: lol|pg||
nt|lml: how to play diamonds|pg||
nt|buffytvs: ace and another works well here|pg||
nt|lml: a duck has a similar effect|pg||
nt|lml: still not enough tricks|pg||
nt|buffytvs: @CK will be trick 7|pg||
nt|lml: but we know the @CA is onside|pg||
nt|lml: yes it can be|pg||
nt|lml: I am thinking about it from declarers perspective|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d5|nt|lml: the old diamond duck play|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dK|pg||
nt|buffytvs: speed of lightning play -- or a variant of it|pg||
nt|lml: that worked well|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lml: Jim knows his partner doesnt have much in clubs so he tried the effect of a spade|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dA|pc|d6|pg||
nt|davidstern: In answer to your question that was the right way to play the diamond suit|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dJ|pc|d4|pc|c6|pg||
nt|lml: headed for +120 I think which more or less covers their partners nonsense at the other table|pg||
pc|d9|pc|h2|pc|dT|pc|c2|pg||
nt|buffytvs: yes -- i think he'll get an extra club or spade in the ending|pg||
nt|lml: or even a heart|pg||
nt|davidstern: Mind you if you look at the auction at the other table it isnt so ridiculous. 2@C presumably precision showing 6 clubs or 5 clubs and 4 card major. 2@H natural NF 2@S showing ...|pg||
nt|davidstern: second suit 3@S invite by North|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c4|pc|cK|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h5|pc|s5|pg||

nt|buffytvs: 50% slam NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: unless you can get North on play|pg||
nt|davidstern: Much better by North|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidstern: They must have some very strict rules about one level opening|pg||
mb|1C|nt|buffytvs: 1@H-pass-1@S does it|pg||
nt|davidstern: Did South really pass|pg||
nt|lml: might still get to spades by north|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D!|nt|davidstern: N/S must be on conservative pills|pg||
mb|d|nt|buffytvs: this might get them to spades from the right side|pg||
mb|3C|nt|davidstern: Surely South will bid now|pg||
nt|davidstern: Phw|pg||
nt|lml: I think 3@C belongs to West|pg||
nt|davidstern: NO WAY they can get to slam|pg||
nt|buffytvs: no -- not now|pg||
nt|buffytvs: If South opens, though...|pg||
nt|davidstern: I would have bid 1@S on North hand over 1@C before I would pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidstern: Shows goodish suit and some values and invites South to bid|pg||
nt|lml: now that is another strange pass|pg||
nt|buffytvs: in the other room Judy opened as South, but 1@S not 1@H|pg||
nt|lml: hello partner showed majors and you have that hand... |pg||
nt|davidstern: Hmm: RE: Chance of a Lifetime !!|pg||
nt|buffytvs: 3-level vul opposite a passed hand though|pg||
nt|davidstern: To see some conservative bridge|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidstern: It should have said|pg||
nt|lml: I dont care!|pg||
nt|lml: I have AJ109 of spades and KQ of hearts|pg||
nt|lml: vulnerable partner showed majors|pg||
nt|lml: I am not going to just pass|pg||
nt|davidstern: Bid Bid Bid Bid Bid Bid Bid Bid Bid Bid Bid Bid Bid Bid Bid Bid Bid Bid Bid Bid Bid Bid Bid Bid Bid Bid Bid Bid Bid Bid Bid Bid |pg||
nt|buffytvs: If this wasn''t an opening bid, why is Jim thinking about coming in again at the 3-level?|pg||
nt|lml: this could get passed out and probably should|pg||
nt|davidstern: Bridge is a bidders game not a game for passers|pg||
nt|lml: unless Paul hesitated for a long time I see no reason to come back in|pg||
nt|buffytvs: lol|pg||
nt|davidstern: Even if he hesitated, didnt hesitate I have 11 cards in my 2 suits - I am prepare to commit to a three level contract in the passout seat|pg||
mb|3H|nt|lml: but when you take this long you usually bid|pg||
nt|buffytvs: if he bids now, can Paul do anything but pass anyway?|pg||
nt|davidstern: Remember North is marked with SOME values|pg||
nt|lml: and he did|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidstern: Does anyone know how I can copy this hand as a lesson for students|pg||
nt|lml: if north passes again I will take his bidding box away|pg||
nt|buffytvs: if North bids 3@S now, is South done?|pg||
nt|davidstern: Joking - I do know|pg||
nt|davidstern: South would pass 3@S as North may be giving forced preference|pg||
mb|3S|nt|lml: Yes I agree with you David|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidstern: 2-1-5-5 |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: oh my goodness|pg||
nt|buffytvs: so North has to decide how far his partner is bidding his hand already|pg||
nt|davidstern: I would rate this auction in my top ten bizarre auctions for 2010. The wheels were set in motion by South's initial pass|pg||
nt|lml: I dont care how much partner is bidding my hand|pg||
nt|buffytvs: ok -- not a good cmmercial for Canadian bridge -- at least the bidding part|pg||
pc|c2|nt|davidstern: Apportion blame 70% South 30% north|pg||
nt|lml: I bid game|pg||
nt|buffytvs: at least the play won't take long|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I open|pg||
nt|buffytvs: and take a cuebid|pg||
nt|davidstern: I can see North shaking his head and I am sitting 8,500 miles away|pg||
nt|lml: and Katie Thorpe bids game and she is my favorite bidding partner|pg||
nt|buffytvs: she would have a better hand though|pg||
nt|lml: both of them should be shaking something|pg||
nt|buffytvs: careful -- this is a family show|pg||
nt|lml: he has a better hand|pg||
nt|davidstern: I wonder if E/W in the other room feel they have some equity in this board when opps didnt bid slam|pg||
nt|davidstern: South Opened 1@S and they still didnt reach slam|pg||
nt|lml: he has the Ace if spades and KQ of hearts better|pg||
nt|lml: no but they just might have reached game!|pg||
pc|s3|nt|buffytvs: they defintiely had a potential plus position -- going to lose 10 though|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c5|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|nt|lml: one of the more well deserved losses I have seen in a while|pg||
pc|hK|nt|davidstern: North had a VERY clear 4@S bid over 3@H so I am going to adjust to 65% S 35% N|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lml: I give them both about 90%|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|nt|davidstern: OK I am with that|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|buffytvs: that's about right -- 90-90|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hT|pc|h3|pc|h5|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s4|pc|sK|pc|cA|pg||
nt|lml: when slam is decent and you struggle to partscore you need to improve your methods|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|hJ|nt|davidstern: Would a scotch at 08:30am give you an idea of how shaken I am after this hand|pg||
nt|buffytvs: there might be a pause after this hand -- Jim can be a bit irascible at times|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s8|pg||
nt|buffytvs: if it's any consolation, it's after dinner here|pg||
nt|lml: and where is my scotch|pg||
nt|buffytvs: you don;t drink scotch|pg||
nt|davidstern: My late wife and I had a system. When we were really pissed off we would ask partner if they would like a coffee|pg||
mc|12|nt|lml: I bid game on this hand|pg||
nt|davidstern: I dont drink scotch either but after that hand I could be converted|pg||
