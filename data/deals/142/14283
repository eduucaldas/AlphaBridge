nt|henryb:  Hello All|pg||
nt|henryb:  back to 17|pg||
nt|gracelin: Hi all|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Hi|pg||
nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|gracelin: Hi Roland.  The first match saw one 20:10 . three 17:13 and one 16:14VP.  Hengsha now leads the field by wnning 20 in their first match against China's Ladies team.|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|sybarra: this may be first ones to one nt |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=ART, 9-13 HCP, 4+@H, maybe longer @C/@D/@S|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome to Al Hollander|pg||
mb|1N|nt|sybarra: another set with the "fun" systems|pg||
nt|ahollan1: expect a LOT of alerts for NS system   Forcing 1@C, Transfer Openers [aka submarine]|pg||
nt|henryb:  Hello All|pg||
nt|henryb:  A partscore battle, with N-S aboe to make 4@c and E-W 2@s|pg||
nt|tejjyid: And this time, it's also probbaly the battle for 2ndplace as well|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hi all.|pg||
mb|d|nt|henryb:  I would expect the auction to start P-P-1@s-some bid showing @h& a minor |pg||
nt|henryb:  wrond again|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=NF, ART, 8-11 HCP, 3@H  [maybe min, 4@H]|pg||
nt|sybarra: al,  are e/w playing precision? |pg||
nt|ahollan1: Shi-Hou are playing Precision -- i was just typing that Shirley :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: for those watching,  this will be a lot of artificial bidding,  |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hi everyone welcome|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: hi|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ahollan1: both pairs at other table also playing Precision variant|pg||
nt|sybarra: only used with experienced partnerships and 400 pages of system notes|pg||
nt|henryb:  The Australian pair clearly do not play strong club|pg||
nt|rodal f: N for the first take out.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Jack, please tell us about these two teams|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think NS plays 1M>2M direct raise 8-10|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: ok maybe only 385 pages|pg||
nt|ahollan1: convention cards -- and some supplementary notes - online under http://www.pabf2010.co.nz/Participants/Convention-Cards/Open.aspx|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi all:)|pg||
nt|brgpro: kebiya=copia, my club|pg||
mb|2S|nt|gracelin: and north is the boss, Mr. Jin|pg||
nt|brgpro: my pd is playing with my boss|pg||
nt|gracelin: not a good sign, Jack.|pg||
nt|brgpro: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: might N sit?|pg||
nt|sybarra: or is he bidding  1 nt |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: this seems rather high|pg||
nt|rodal f: Teyssier was cold:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: must say I am not a fan of sitting at imps|pg||
nt|jcwla: D/K if this is the dummy N is expecting, but it's not enough.  This is down a couple.|pg||
mb|3C|nt|henryb:  clearly 1N was forcing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Reid's 2@D bid doesn't seem to fit the explanation I gave -- but i got if from their notes |pg||
nt|gracelin: This is the first match of an invitational event of Beijing's 10 bridge clubs. |pg||
nt|Walddk2: While Jack will be watching the Football World Cup I presume :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzkt: good morning all|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: Hi all, gm from sunny bangalore in South India|pg||
nt|rodal f: The web page for the turney: http://www.pabf2010.co.nz/|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Good morning|pg||
pc|h7|nt|rv: Hi Rodal|pg||
nt|gracelin: the 10 teams will play a 16-bds round robin to decide winners.  Cash prizes for all teams plus for wnners of every match. |pg||
nt|brgpro: all other team members are in beijing|pg||
nt|gracelin: and NBA final about 3 hours ago.|pg||
nt|brgpro: i prefer to stay at home...|pg||
pc|h4|nt|janm: EW will probably end in 4@s on this one, and should make it unless NS get 2 club ruffs - I guess 5@c is actually better, let's see if West will show his club support to get there|pg||
nt|janm: This auction might get them to 3NT, which would not be a success|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the Open Room starts play with board  29 -- so they will see results from us|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure who do bet on here,  defense if @H start I think|pg||
pc|hK|nt|henryb:  the two-step probably shows constructive values|pg||
nt|gracelin: EW in both rooms reached the inferior 4-3 fit rather than the 5-3 D fit.|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|mwigor: hi all|pg||
nt|barnets: looks like a save v 5@H|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: we can only peek at their [and any other vugraph table] using http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/ |pg||
nt|gracelin: the two teams playing here are the host Xinyuan and their sister club Sanchen Cartoon|pg||
pc|s2|nt|henryb:  We do not have an auction, but at the other table West over reached to 4@s and caught a vey bad dummy|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Hyper-agressive bidding by the NZ  north-south in the other room propelled the auction very high, very quick|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 6@d in the 4-3 fit looks OK to me|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 6NT you can make with the right guesses as well|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: big think by Tony|pg||
pc|s6|nt|janm: Perhaps if W bid 3@c here, E might retreat to 5@c, but West decided his suit was good enough to play in, and with the @h A lead, he'll be right, I think|pg||
nt|pelu: Hi all|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: this match is 1st China-Taipei vs 5th Japan|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|sK|nt|tejjyid: The auction looks a bit murky, Nunn calrifies it for us|pg||
pc|s7|nt|kiwi_joker: ..and in the end they got the outcome they wanted (opps made the last mistake!)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: a passive @S lead & East will be very happy|pg||
pc|s8|nt|tejjyid: Thanks for coming...|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|d4|nt|barnets: @DK|pg||
pc|s3|nt|frankaus: g'day all|pg||
nt|gracelin: both pairs of Xinyuan team play Precision.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hi all.|pg||
nt|gracelin: Hi Jordan|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|barnets: may have worked|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ahollan1: likely 300 for NS -- i'd feel good bringing that score back to the table|pg||
nt|barnets: as if east had rufffed with the 9 dec would crash the spade honours|pg||
pc|dT|nt|henryb:  Nasty breaks on this hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is the 1st of 12 matches for Round Robin  2 -- results aren't posted yet from RR1, but the rotation for RR2 is based upon final tally|pg||
pc|d5|nt|pelu: 1nt had been a nice contract - but prob forcing - but even then I would have passed in S (pd is a passed hand)|pg||
nt|gracelin: north did not expect south has 4-card spade support|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|henryb:  I do not know why East wanted a club; a heart would have been more useful|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: results site is http://www.nzbridgecongress.co.nz/pabf2010/|pg||
nt|tejjyid: not much fun discarding from the N hand|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ahollan1: the Juniors are playing this in 4@CN|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|sybarra: welcome Frank|pg||
nt|frankaus: part score battles are worth a suprising number of imps|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: Sorry was away from table :(  Will record a claim shortly|pg||
nt|frankaus: 6-8 for a double part score swing mounts up real quick|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dK|pg||
nt|brgpro: -2 become -1|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: 13th @H might have worked well there|pg||
pc|hA|nt|henryb:  this will drift down one, but slowly. As I have observed before, no one ever goed dowd wuickly|pg||
pc|h3|nt|gracelin: another D and ruffing by north will return to -2|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|jcwla: The OR is starting with 29 and 30 so we'll feed them comparisons when they circle back to 17.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: sorry fast play i may have missed something here|pg||
nt|brgpro: dont think they will find it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What, no Li, Wang or Chang at this table?? :)  Not in the other room either for that matter|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h2|nt|janm: NS have a heart, a spade and a club and EW have 5 or 6 spades (depending whether N's spade trick is taken by a ruff or not), 3 diamonds and at least 2 clubs|pg||
pc|h9|nt|kiwi_joker: dummy's diamonds an alluring target - but unreachable|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|pelu: Yes 1Nt was F1 - but from a passsed hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so Reid could ditch his 2nd @S|pg||
nt|sybarra: I suspect their bidding was slightly different|pg||
nt|pelu: Hi all - my name is Peter Lund (Denmark) and I will try to help u in this round|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d7|nt|tejjyid: I think there was a better line, after the @S pitch Noth's hand can be striped and you can play @H for a guaranteeed 2 tricks|pg||
nt|tejjyid: but it wasn't necessary|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Oh, we have a Wang here|pg||
pc|hT|nt|gracelin: a 2nd chance to pla D, and south did.  Now it's up to north to ruff partner's winner|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|henryb:  One thing I observe generally: if declarer takes a long time he is obeying Hammans second rule: If you don't play a card you can't go down|pg||
nt|ahollan1: only every bid|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The most common surname in China we were told earlier|pg||
pc|c6|nt|gracelin: north didn't|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cA|nt|h_karluk: so far neither of them succumbed|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cQ|pc|cK|nt|ahollan1: so only down 1|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|h_karluk: -1|pg||

nt|ahollan1: i should say if you RESPOND to 1@H|pg||
nt|geot: I@S, but really stuch if pd bids 2@D|pg||
nt|geot: stuck|pg||
nt|geot: I will pass 2@D in that case|pg||
nt|geot: But I would pass 1@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hehe    i was typing   "easiest to PASS"|pg||
nt|geot: yes:)....but if you bid on hands similar to this, I think bidding the major is the best. Might work even if partner bid 4@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but make @C2  @CK then it really is a problem|pg||
nt|fabog:  hi all|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hi all welcome aboard|pg||
nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|sundiszno: this is a practice match|pg||
nt|sundiszno: from Budapest, Hungary|pg||
nt|vugraphzmz: hi everyone|pg||
nt|sundiszno: the hungarian national team practices for oostende, and getting a challenger|pg||
nt|fabog:  Hittmann - Szonyi plays a special strong club relay system|pg||
nt|vugraphzmz: hey all (:|pg||
mb|1S|nt|xenya: hello Brigitta|pg||
nt|sundiszno: in fact, operator have been interchanged, so we have Daniel here|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: Daniel then|pg||
nt|sundiszno: and Arpad plays tzhe same system with them, so he is a specialist of EW-'s bidding system|pg||
mb|2S|mb|d|mb|r|nt|xenya: why was E's pass alerted?|pg||
mb|2N!|an| |nt|sundiszno: fabog, your answer, pls :)|pg||
nt|fabog:  Can be strong balanced, W has to reopen with double with 1.5+ defensive tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: oh i see, thanks|pg||
mb|p|nt|sundiszno: NS playing precision, weak NT|pg||
nt|sundiszno: there is some money at stake, if the national team wins, they take it, if Gamax wins, they donate it to or junior team |pg||
nt|vugraphzmz: lead is 3rd/5th if there's at least a jack, if otherwise highest|pg||
mb|3C|an| |nt|h_karluk: Geza strong player, also served 10 years (92-02) WBF MBSZ Executive Committee |pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: in 2003 was WBF Organizing Committee member |pg||
nt|sundiszno: in the open, NS is in 5@h doubled|pg||
nt|henryb:  Hello all|pg||
mb|p|nt|andreasw:  good sacrefise if u guess everything right in 4@s|pg||
mb|p|pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: Asbi-Tobing play Cappelletti over 1@H-(DBL)    i have to admit, i don't remember what that means other than 2@C was NOT available as natural non-force|pg||
nt|geot: South tried 2@C at the other table, probably NF :).... but then North went to 4@H, naturally|pg||
nt|ritong: hi chaps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: bon jour Henri|pg||
nt|geot: Hi Henri|pg||
pc|s2|nt|h_karluk: Gabor WINKLER is a World International Master|pg||
pc|s8|nt|henryb:  4@s will make with good peaking shoes|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Wu didn't really PASS|pg||
pc|s4|nt|geot: no|pg||
nt|xenya: with @CJ well placed and no ruff, 8 tricks should be easy |pg||
pc|s7|nt|h_karluk: I think Truscott is a nice defense to strong club and relay system|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sT|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: suspect 2@D|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dT|pc|d4|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d5|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
nt|geot: sure, thats why Huang bid 3@D|pg||
pc|c3|nt|andreasw:  :p|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cJ|pc|c7|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ahollan1: even then -- Patrick took 2 more bids than mere mortals would on East hand|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d3|pc|s9|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h4|nt|h_karluk: and we introduced Peter and Csaba previous session|pg||
nt|andreasw:  how did 5@h go 3?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: even doubled|pg||
nt|sundiszno: several @s leads from west makes @hJ a trick|pg||
nt|andreasw:  :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  defense took @sAK, then uppercut the @hJ|pg||
nt|andreasw:  the they did good:)|pg||

nt|frankaus: just 3 here|pg||
nt|sybarra: -1 not the end of the world here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: missed opportunity, but any plus may be good on that board|pg||
nt|barnets: would hav been a nice try|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi RV:) And welcome. Long time ago.|pg||
nt|rodal f: A easy 3NT?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: not sure abt made +1 , defenders likely cashed a @s+ a @c and 2 @d|pg||
nt|gracelin: don't follow the play.  Hou should not ruff the Heart.  He could get in later to draw trump|pg||
nt|h_karluk: if doesnt ruff then decl makes loser in loser|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@H=11-15 HCP, a) 5+@H  b) 4441@D |pg||
nt|jcwla: no 2 @D's -- two went on @C KJ and one on @HJ|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: this tourney is played in double round robin format with no subsequent play-offs|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: feel free anyone to commentate|pg||
nt|gracelin: This shud be an easy 4S for NS, even if East can get his Heart ruff, there's only 3 tricks for defense|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @hJ master forces to ruff or pitch stiff @c at th table|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but table had 4 dias and decl had only 2 club winner|pg||
nt|gracelin: on previous one south shud not ruff either HK or HJ, just wait to get in to draw trump|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think +1 impossible|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sybarra: can W stay in his seat |pg||
nt|sybarra: yes seems so |pg||
nt|sybarra: "stay in his seat" as in pass|pg||
nt|brgpro: easy 4@h or 3NT...|pg||
nt|gracelin: 3NT is the coldest game contract for NS, but of course, 4H also makes here.|pg||
mb|d|nt|henryb:  6@h is a reasonable contract, needing 2-2 hearts or stiff queen|pg||
nt|henryb:  and no club ruff on lead|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Miller-Stout play precision.|pg||
nt|tejjyid: It's irrational, but I bet Nunn & Hans feel a warm fuzzy feeling inside after the good start|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ahollan1: wow  last hand Chinese Taipei Juniors 4@C made 5 |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: interesting choices for Shi over 2@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N, trap pass, 3@C [@H raise], 2@D all seem to have merit|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe tryingn to get the @D suit in before the ht raise |pg||
nt|henryb:  with various conventions of their own, such as this 3@d bid to show a gf raise|pg||
nt|gracelin: so Sanchen beat 4S in the closed room to get the first blood.  But I really don't believe south (Hou) ruff HK and play CA and another club to allow 4S be made|pg||
nt|gracelin: I know Hou very well. He never made such mistakes.|pg||
nt|jcwla: BTW...any comment on @HQ from N?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 9 cards fit, don't get the idea why 3N preferred|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: green V red usually a go signal :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes thought he might come in  but suit is a bit tacky |pg||
nt|sybarra: my guess is we are in game force sequence here|pg||
nt|h_karluk: marked, isn't it?|pg||
nt|gracelin: thanks to south's doubleton club|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  hello to all|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hi Sveta|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ahollan1: and protecting against opener having the 4441@D hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: Hou pulled out the 4 @s card then changed his mind|pg||
nt|tejjyid: BTW, anyone who wants to jump in and advise me I'm an idiot, do feel free|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: thinking|pg||
nt|jcwla: N's negative double showed the minors.  Now you see the problems with 2@S:|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hi Sveta|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Sveta|pg||
nt|gracelin: because 9 fast tricks, Hamdi.|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: One, it gives the opponents two levels of room; two,|pg||
nt|gracelin: just tried to catch declarer's unprepared and played HJ on that trick. |pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwi_joker: Not sure about 4@H, as Miller still apparently had the K@S to cue|pg||
nt|henryb:  3N is probably a "serious slam try, while minor suit cues would be "courtesy"|pg||
nt|rv: yes cold, @h8 ensures a stopper and only 4-0 @d break offside can trouble this contract|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I'll feel like I'm back at the bridge table|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: the more the merrier|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: i expect this will fail|pg||
nt|janm: Looks as if NS can make about 3 hearts (maybe 4) and EW can make about 3 clubs.|pg||
nt|barnets: n/s have an easy partscore in clubs|pg||
nt|pelu: Basis system: NS: Precision @c and EW: 5 card major with weak and strong NT (green-red)|pg||
nt|jcwla: it now gives E something to think about when a huge chunk of the strength of E's hand is a @S void that's of no use in defense to 4@SX.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|sybarra: needs the spade lead,   should be -1 |pg||
nt|janm: Let's see if EW can get the spade ruff to beat this. If W leads a high club, E can overtake to lead a spade back|pg||
nt|janm: But on the trump lead I think NS are going to make 4 hearts|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@D is a mystery|pg||
nt|gracelin: Hi Sveta|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Jack, they can't do without you!|pg||
nt|xenya: in the other room, N just bid 3N|pg||
pc|s2|nt|tejjyid: what a nice system - pay in 8 card @D fit at 2 level |pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: no warm fuzzy things running around the table (yet)|pg||
nt|gracelin: by opening 3D EW missed a decent sacrifice here, 5D doubled is only -2|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think that very soft 2@h weak underlined many things, just helped declarer|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|henryb:  I recently saw a study suggesting that with 4-3-3-3 opposite 4-4-3-2  you should not try for the 4-4 major suit fit|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Other room just started to bid Bd 18|pg||
nt|henryb:  Oh? I thought they went back to play 29 and 30|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|frankaus: has a chance but its really tough|pg||
nt|rodal f: Safe for a try by 10 tricks now.|pg||
nt|brgpro: u see, fu is playing with the boss...|pg||
nt|gracelin: lucky to find partner with DA instead of KQ|pg||
pc|c5|nt|rv: now 10 tricks possibly|pg||
pc|c7|nt|sybarra: would have to magically read the club suit I think |pg||
nt|janm: So we've had two hands in a row where the best defence would be to take ruffs.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure if i would have been any better off with 3N|pg||
nt|sybarra: well it both sounds like they have an ace the DO NOT have |pg||
nt|barnets: i think south should x and north bid 3@C|pg||
nt|pelu: very nice contract if @Hs was running - or even 4-1|pg||
nt|jcwla: Yeah it's sort of surprising at these colors that nobody took further action.|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sybarra: (imho)|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: E figures to be short so playing 9@S there would have been a decent shot|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Nobuyuki Hayashi|pg||
nt|tejjyid: probably a bit early for the warm fuzzy things|pg||
nt|jcwla: E has made the trusting decision and will be rewarded.  @H's E/W have three losers off the top.|pg||
pc|h5|nt|frankaus: now @C was req|pg||
nt|pelu: I see the point - but how do u know that ps has 4-4-3-2 :)?|pg||
nt|henryb:  I am however convinced that it is losing bridge in general to bid game with two balanced hands and 24 HCP|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Wang Zhi-ge|pg||
nt|tejjyid: they like to sleep in|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: :)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: Reid checks to see if 2 tricks is enough to beat 6@H|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sybarra: might he be concerned spade is cashing?|pg||
nt|npcjpn: Hello from Hamilton.|pg||

nt|sybarra: @H lead is bad idea now however |pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|nt|sybarra: Reid might have also been checking backs of cards to see if they match |pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: N and E starting taking the bidding cards away before Reid had a chance to X|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm told neither NS player is known for being pessimisstic -- @SA not cashing would be way beyond that description|pg||
nt|gracelin: West may underlead his CA to lose it|pg||
nt|h_karluk: say played a @s, still retains trump control|pg||
nt|h_karluk: defenders cannot cash more than @cA|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and i dont think decl careless enough to begin with @hQ|pg||
nt|gracelin: West may lose his CA if he tries the underlead.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: for now seems best defense there is to play @dJ|pg||
nt|h_karluk: in that case decl has to ruff and tackle hearts|pg||
pc|c6|nt|janm: Of course S doesn't know for certain that the spade A is onside |pg||
nt|pzpp: E-W here just bid to an unlucky game in NT, with almost every card placed badly for them|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|rodal f: ? 9 u have. By the @Shook u still have 9 if it loose.|pg||

pc|c9|pc|cJ|nt|pelu: best play @D and try yo set up a squeeze against West|pg||

nt|gracelin: still 11 tricks for a push|pg||
pc|hK|nt|pelu: pressure on N|pg||
nt|henryb:  it would be nice to stop in 1NT,  -- oh oh, North just gave the contract|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|d|nt|geot: Bad board for Taipei in the CR|pg||
mb|2S|nt|h_karluk: however i guess they play in defense : Pass =  "Strong" or "natural", D =  C+S, 1D=D+S, 1H=H+S, 1S=any garbage not suitable for any other bid.1NT= C+H,2C=C+D,2D=D+H,2H/S=(5)6+,2NT  ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: =  Extreme 2-suiter, I don't think they ever pass weak hands when nonvul.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sundiszno: EW playing a home-grown strong club-based relay system, fabog is the expert of that|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Chinese Taipei can lock up the win if they just lose by less than 39 imps|pg||
nt|geot: West in the CR also overcalled 2@H over a 1 spade opener, and ended up playing ag 4@Sx|pg||
nt|xenya: N is not strong enough to use stayman here, so he passes, and 4-4 spade is missed -- but 1N is a solid contract|pg||

nt|rnmalik: Hello all and welcome.|pg||
nt|gracelin: suth will pen a Precision 1C, I guess|pg||

nt|gracelin: north might have a way to show his 3-suiter in a positive hand.|pg||
nt|brgpro: we play different style of X then suit...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, he had 8 certain tricks in his own hand and gambled on one with partner|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I have seen worse gambles|pg||
nt|h_karluk: got it now|pg||
mb|1N|nt|janm: I confess I'd also open 2@s with the S hand - everything is right - vulnerability, position, spades being the highest suit|pg||
nt|npcjpn: Ino won the senior teams in Bejing.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Nice to have RV here. All info comes:) Local time here is 0530 but free today:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: Of course now that 2@s has been alerted, it probably showed 5 spades and a 4 or 5 card minor, so wasn't even wrong on suit length, but I think it would be right to open it even if ...|pg||
nt|janm: it was just a weak 2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: same 1@H explanation as last board|pg||
nt|npcjpn: This year, he plays in open.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Great result there for Indonesia.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 3N -srry for typo|pg||
mb|2D|nt|barnets: a heavy 2N|pg||
nt|barnets: with 22 hcp and good 5 card suit|pg||
nt|barnets: n./s would be s well to bid 7N as 6 |pg||
nt|barnets: 13  tricks without club lead|pg||
nt|h_karluk: likely 2N for NS, however who knows|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: ok now can e/w find and make slam? |pg||
nt|ahollan1: notes say Newell has 6@S --- i believe the notes|pg||
nt|sybarra: or can they really make 6 @D without help?|pg||
nt|henryb:  we changed boards all of a sudden|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: the match to watch|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 2@H was Mm 2-suiter, weak (youcouldguess, right?)|pg||
nt|jcwla: 20/20 hand here - always want to post the plus on these.|pg||
nt|gracelin: this one should be a routine 4H|pg||
mb|2N|nt|barnets: east is marginal for a 4N raise|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Cards are nicely placed for NT.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: 2 @C looks like "single suited"  |pg||
nt|sybarra: my guess is W can tell which suit |pg||
nt|frankaus: sys on  here is normal these days with X replacing 21C|pg||
nt|janm: N probably has a good idea that his partner's second suit is clubs and so won't be useful, but it's certainly possible to envision game anyway.|pg||
nt|pelu: 3NT on @dQ|pg||
nt|henryb:  2N clearly a @s raise|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i meant 1@h artificial|pg||
mb|3H|nt|sybarra: yes and systems on= transfer in this case |pg||
nt|ahollan1: interference will slow down EW|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes|pg||
nt|sybarra: with bidding opps suits |pg||
nt|rv: Hi Barnet and all specs|pg||
nt|barnets: hi|pg||
nt|rv: it is 9 AM IST here in India which is 4.30 hrs ahead of London time at this time of the year.|pg||
nt|pelu: A problem for E - this bidding could in precision be on 11+5|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that shld b xfer|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: hard to believe both red suits behaving favorably -- and will probably misguess both Qs anyway|pg||
mb|4H|nt|frankaus: olmost certainly its @H now that S trans to @S|pg||
nt|sybarra: and wrong colors to be stepping in with 3 @D |pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry with 3 @C I meant|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: I don't know what options he had to invite over the DBL (surely 3@s was not invitational). I think S is going to come to 10 tricks, and he'd probably have accepted most ...|pg||
nt|janm: invitations, with maximum values and good spots in both suits|pg||
nt|tejjyid: nothing very frightening about this contract, orindeed 4@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: yes|pg||
nt|jcwla: The stakes are raised here, though not into game.|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: looks to be a playable spot |pg||
nt|friggi: sure it does|pg||
nt|sybarra: actually 3 nt will work for e/w |pg||
nt|rv: my apologies for the delay, signing in from sunny Bangalore in South India|pg||
nt|barnets: i thnk north will lead a @H|pg||
nt|rv: after 6@d, can North consider an attacking lead?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: not much to the play here worst he can lose 3@S 1@D|pg||
nt|pzpp: yes, and the lead helps declarer ahead in the race for tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: same strat as the bidding in Board 1|pg||
nt|henryb:  2@d is apparently a transfer|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: now makes many|pg||
nt|npcjpn: 10 tricks, next board.|pg||
nt|henryb:  3@c is a non-standard rebid -- and since I do not have the CC handy, I cannot tell you what it shows|pg||
nt|brgpro: 2@d is not transfer, but GF stayman|pg||
nt|h_karluk: another 12-14 NT|pg||
pc|s3|nt|henryb:  but this time I think S whould bid 2N|pg||
nt|brgpro: 13-15|pg||

pc|sJ|nt|frankaus: welcome fridrik|pg||

nt|ahollan1: did NS do well here or not?   only the shadow knows|pg||
nt|tejjyid: pick the trumps & prety much claim|pg||
nt|gracelin: Looks like a Precision sequence, a game forcing 2D followed by a natural 3H.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: wouldn't be surprised if same contract without interference|pg||
nt|pzpp: good shift|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|barnets: the reson behind the spade is|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: That is his strength:) the @S suit.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: oh i played that long years ago, 2 way stayman , 2D promises game|pg||
nt|Walddk2: ´ó¼ÒºÃ  to our Chinese viewers (not sure what it means, though) :)|pg||
pc|s8|nt|gracelin: 4H is doomed to lose 1S + 2H + 1C.  3NT will also go down if East leads low spade and finds club shift in time. |pg||
pc|s6|nt|sybarra: hi Fridrik :)  welcome|pg||
nt|friggi: Hi Syirley|pg||
nt|janm: Miller knows  that the DBL was a little light, so expects W to have only one spade, and takes the spade finesse|pg||
nt|sybarra: some kibber (or you Al)  I am still triying to figure out if e/w can handle 6 @D|pg||
nt|h_karluk: to set 3N careful defense cooeration required|pg||
nt|gracelin: looks like 11 tricks now|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sK|pg||
nt|frankaus: 5 imps to NS here|pg||
nt|barnets: dec has not spades from 6@D bid|pg||
nt|rv: if opps don't have source of tricks and just enough values it pays to passive, after 6@h there was a chance for North to consider @c lead|pg||
nt|rv: N-S are close to making 10 tricks in @h strain|pg||
nt|h_karluk: *cooperation & collaboration|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, East needs to duck the first Heart, take the second and shift to club.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: :)|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|henryb:  ah. I misread the opening bid: a strong club, and 2N probably 11-13 with no 5 card major|pg||

pc|dA|nt|barnets: dummy did not check for majors|pg||
nt|rv: after 6@d|pg||
nt|barnets: er must have 5 spades|pg||
nt|npcjpn: no possibility for 11 tricks, West should claim.|pg||
nt|rodal f: A possible IMp board for NS.3@S EW? Seems on.|pg||
nt|gracelin: when Heart is played from dummy, East can take the 1st one.  |pg||

pc|hA|pc|d8|pg||

pc|h3|nt|friggi: fin for K in W|pg||

nt|gracelin: srr for my poor typing|pg||
nt|h_karluk: its ok buddy|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|s5|pg||

pc|hK|nt|rv: I would have competed to 3@c via 2n (to show weaker hand) with West hand|pg||
mc|11|nt|janm: Or the defenders will lead diamonds for him, making the play faster as now he can claim|pg||

mb|1N|nt|geot: setting trick as well....|pg||

nt|ahollan1: wait for it Al|pg||
nt|fabog:  double = 4+ spades, can be weak distributional hand as well|pg||
nt|h_karluk: possibly 2n|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 2 way @sQ hook|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|xenya: interesting defence|pg||
mb|p|nt|sundiszno: is it possible to find a bigger @d fit after E raises @ss?|pg||
nt|fabog:  if West says 3 diamonds, but i think in this vulnarability he will not|pg||
nt|xenya: W has a decent 6-carder, yet he prefers to show 9432 |pg||
nt|vugraphzmz: XX is 5 clubs and something else i couldn't hear|pg||
nt|fabog:  2 spades denies good hand|pg||
mb|3C|nt|ahollan1: DBL=14+ HCP|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Asbi PASS=Forcing [if Wu PASSES]|pg||
nt|h_karluk: xx like quasi-game force, sounds Tim Bourke relay based|pg||
mb|p|nt|sundiszno: is it obligatory to show a 4card @s suit, Árpád?|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|an| |nt|fabog:  depend on distribution and vulnarability, not with 4333 or 4432|pg||
nt|henryb:  I am surprised that North did not bid 3@h|pg||
mb|3S!|an| |nt|ahollan1: RDBL was forced by system|pg||
nt|h_karluk: would you x as W?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: i checked, vernes' book was published in 1966|pg||
nt|sundiszno: polish double - means no better idea than a @s lead|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i guess they are on the way slam after 3@s cue|pg||
mb|4C|nt|geot: You cant play 1NTx with those methods, but occasionally 1NTxx|pg||
nt|geot: Wu reasonably did not want to defend the redoubled contract. Will Huang bid 2@D now, suggesting red suits? Or 2@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: one options = weak 1-suiter pulls the double immediately [via some mechanism]|pg||
nt|sundiszno: or polish pass indeed|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: vernes' book wasn't published in english -- but i believe a British author wrote a book based upon Verne|pg||
nt|h_karluk: to me S shld dictate, N described his intentions well|pg||
nt|sundiszno: they are off a keycard and the trump Q|pg||
nt|h_karluk: still 4@s might be good try|pg||
nt|xenya: S has lots of controls -- but does he know how strong N is, and, more important, that he has 4 cards in hearts? |pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think he knows : a) RD, b) 3@s cue|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ahollan1: i was going to ask if EW have discussed WEST runnouts -- obviously not|pg||
nt|xenya: his own hearts are quite weak |pg||
nt|h_karluk: and good news no @d control there, so obv on other suits decent hand|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, probably, Hamdi|pg||
nt|andreasw:  2nt is how strong 16-18?|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: 5@d last chance, tho hard to visualize|pg||
nt|xenya: now N is in awkward position perhaps -- what about the diamond control?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: N knows 5@h safe|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d9|pc|dK|nt|h_karluk: with double fit dictated|pg||
nt|xenya: well perhaps he figured things out  |pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so Wu's 2@C up-the-line scramble|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|nt|h_karluk: i expected different, ie 4@s by S and 5@d by N, however a matter of style|pg||
nt|xenya: 11 imps to Hungary|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|h_karluk: say 15-17|pg||

pc|c4|pc|cA|nt|geot: He will win this contract|pg||

nt|henryb:  I do not, but it is playable in a sound opening bid structure|pg||
nt|npcjpn: But some player believes not claiming in order to see defensive methods.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: first slam of the match|pg||
nt|tejjyid: played to make partner feel better about missing game|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: As I said, you go down in a makeable contract if East sarts with only one club.|pg||
nt|brgpro: 10 teams are in the field and everyone will have a prize at the end|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so far not much difficult hands|pg||
mb|1D|nt|friggi: ye sbut regardless, why give it away without fightingÐ|pg||
nt|friggi: ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: this looks precision-ish |pg||
nt|frankaus: 3NT is likely here|pg||
nt|cascade: does this meet your standard for 2NT Jan?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: does not meet my standard, but i might do it anyway|pg||
mb|1S|nt|friggi: sure it is|pg||
nt|janm: I probably wouldn't do it vul, but it's certainly close - I can't imagine bidding anything except 2NT or P|pg||
nt|cascade: 3@c will be invitational with hearts|pg||
nt|janm: Presumably 3@c shows some sort of heart raise|pg||
nt|cascade: and Miller finds himself with a surprisingly good hand for all of the bidding so far|pg||
nt|janm: Everyone has different approaches to Unusual, but as far as I know everyone plays that the cue bids show partner's suit and the 4th suit (although some of us use one and some the ...|pg||
nt|janm: other for those meanings)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=ART, STR, F1, (good 13)14+ HCP unbal, 15+ HCP BAL|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: may be too hard to find|pg||
nt|rv: French Polynesia is doing a lot better than New Caledonia in this tourney|pg||
nt|h_karluk: were 27 hcp and no game|pg||
nt|gracelin: But on the other hand, 4 round of D may subject East to some discard problem|pg||
mb|p|nt|cascade: yes there are various ways|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not sure about 4@C|pg||
nt|janm: Yes, especially with partner bidding 2NT vulnerable, Miller must wonder if his side has a game|pg||
nt|cascade: 3@c tied to hearts and 3@d tied to spades|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: a transfer over the transfer|pg||
nt|npcjpn: looks like Michaels.|pg||
mb|2C|nt|sybarra: and it is precision  (just not sure which variety) |pg||
nt|frankaus: communications wont be easy |pg||
nt|cascade: personally i play the lower cue agrees partner's suit and the higher is the other suit|pg||
nt|janm: As it is, it's pretty unlucky that 4@c goes down|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=FG, 8+ HCP, 5+@D|pg||
nt|npcjpn: dbl = 3-card support?|pg||
nt|henryb:  the black kings are well placed foe N-S|pg||
nt|pelu: 1@H = @s - and 7+|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3@H/@S available for EW.|pg||
nt|tejjyid: a vey SOUND 2@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: Nt for NS = 12-15|pg||
mb|2D|nt|friggi: but np for 3NT|pg||
nt|fabsayc: that is not why i am not sure|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry wrong cc|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=FG, 10+ HCP, 3+ CNTRL [A=2, K=1], 1-suit, 6+@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H RELAY|pg||
nt|barnets: n/s have good save in 5@C|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 2nd suit or repeating the transfer?|pg||
nt|npcjpn: i bet second suit.|pg||
nt|jcwla: 3@H is preemptive.  2@C is truly moth-eaten on a quacky min and a 5-bagger.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 3@H=7@D 0@C 33  [or (23)80, 2290]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just what Newell wanted to hear :(|pg||
nt|rodal f: Are those 15HP wourth 1NT?  Ok. I use to do the same:)|pg||
nt|gracelin: whether the south hand worth a Vul. 2-level overcall has been argued for years.|pg||
mb|p|nt|friggi: transfer|pg||
nt|sybarra: the good news is E (or W) will have to lead something |pg||
nt|friggi: thne 3H then 3NT|pg||
nt|friggi: dbl tr|pg||
nt|frankaus: first 9 is on top then it gets difficult|pg||
nt|friggi: 3NT is cold|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it might get you way too high and also misdirect the lead|pg||
nt|henryb:  I do not agree with 3N: I think that should show tricks, and 2N should show 18-19 balanced|pg||
nt|henryb:  that assumes you open 1N with all balanced 15-17|pg||
nt|pelu: 1NT here is 6-10, so Why bid 2NT?|pg||
nt|henryb:  this is the only lead to beat 6N|pg||
nt|pelu: No they play 11-14 NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Newell has extra King for his 1st seat 1@C -- but can't imagine anything other than 3N now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N is discouraging, but since Reid unlimited it is not pure signoff|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Liu still has chance to splinter|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: EW have ended in 5@H on  18|pg||
nt|rv: FP is lying 8th and NC is lying 13th out of 13 teams with 3/4th of tourney over|pg||
nt|pelu: 6@s easy slam to make|pg||
nt|fabsayc: good afternoon from partly cloudy vancouver|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: nice of @D's to break |pg||
nt|barnets: but never bid|pg||
nt|barnets: only -200|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3@S0single and force til min 4@H|pg||
nt|rv: I might have opened 1@d and rebid 1n with north hand|pg||
nt|gracelin: Good decision to pass.  South may regret his overcall.|pg||
nt|gracelin: winners of every match get a prize of about US$150.  |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Can 2@C be 5-4 either way, Patrick?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|cascade: Jan tells me she plays the cues the exact opposite way to me|pg||
nt|cascade: the most important thing is that you have an agreement with your partner|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think 3c for hearts, 3d for spades is the most common|pg||
nt|janm: This time we have a game where the declaring side will need ruffs (diamonds) to make it, I think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S asks controls   A=2 K=1|pg||
nt|rv: North could have chanced 3@c with enough distribution though suit is not good at these colors|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: slam chances looking rather slim|pg||
nt|npcjpn: yes, that's I am afraid of.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: he's done it|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Chung now has a Powerhouse|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 1d opening won't appeal to everyone holding west's cards but it will be a popular choice in many sys card there|pg||
pc|h6|nt|kiwibridge: twin 50's on 18 to Japan for 3 imps|pg||
nt|npcjpn: 4@s, just splinter? or exclusion RKCB?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I hate the pass of 2NT here|pg||
pc|h9|nt|cascade: and the defense have ruffs to beat it |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N=3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so the hand with void gets to declare?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: contemplating 5@C opposite @SK and @HA?|pg||
nt|barnets: he also may have tried 3@C over 2@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: 2@h alerted|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: laughing :)|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|janm: Although if he takes the club finesse he's been offered (right you are that the club bid got them off to the wrong lead), he can pitch the diamond losers and then just needs to ...|pg||
nt|janm: avoid a spade ruff (or S needs to figure things out and give his partner one, which may be hard)|pg||
nt|janm: So that will be a third hand that could have been defeated by a defensive ruff |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: if so then pass =3|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 9 for @H switch, is it?|pg||
nt|gracelin: trump shift now|pg||
nt|jcwla: Sad to see W rewarded for that opener.|pg||
nt|gracelin: They are all Precisioners.|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, that's the way I play.  But I know people put emphasis on club and obnly promises 5-card C|pg||
pc|cA|nt|frankaus: a not so obvious @D lead/switch can couse lots of communications problems|pg||
nt|sybarra: club lead gets a bit messy |pg||
nt|rv: West opening is post-modern, I like his raise to 2@s with 3 card fit instead of 2@d|pg||
nt|pelu: Wellcome to Martin Johnson from Canada|pg||
nt|gracelin: six tricks seem to be the limit for declarer|pg||
pc|c6|nt|friggi: no problem. play for @D 3-3 |pg||
nt|pelu: so 2Nt would be 16-17 (18)|pg||
nt|rv: all of us like to upgrade the hand more often than downgrade, here North hand is clear candidate to downgrade|pg||
pc|c7|nt|fabsayc: i think in new zealand would be simpler to alert natural bids|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: interesting -- could only do that because of @H10|pg||
nt|ahollan1: glad i'm not at the table -- as declarer i'd go into long tank because of too many possible lines|pg||
nt|npcjpn: nice bidding.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: should be a formality to make it now, wd|pg||
nt|pelu: agree - 2NT is a bid u dont play - either 3Nt or 3@c|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think 1@D followed by 2@C is systemic in Precision|pg||
pc|cK|nt|rodal f: How may HP would u have shoved me by that sequense RV?|pg||
pc|c9|nt|henryb:  because I think you need 3N to show a very different hand: say Ax, xxx, AKQxxxx, Q|pg||
nt|ahollan1: a) @S ruff  b) @SQ @CAK float @DQ c) @SK then ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: 5@CX on its way down three - would be even from S.  Was all set to praise S's discretion.|pg||
pc|h8|nt|fabsayc: where grant showed four spades is unclear|pg||
nt|pelu: 5 rounds of bidding - just to miss a laydown slam :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: bids being explained|pg||
nt|fabsayc: in my methods north bids 2@S over the tranfer advance|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so we can focus on slam bidding rather than game|pg||
nt|pzpp: I think that they play UDCA, just discourage|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|janm: Declarer going after those diamond ruffs - but that will probably make it easier for S to realize he needs his partner to have a spade ruff coming, won't it?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but as he did not discard a diamond i dont see how defense can go wrong|pg||
nt|pelu: I am told: 1@S = asking bid in @s, 2@D = 5 card !, (2 top) 2@H asking in @h - 2@S no @h-control|pg||
pc|c3|nt|pelu: but 3@c would prob be X - so...|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Thanks PEter, you have precisely expressed my view NT isinv/forc|pg||
pc|cT|nt|jcwla: Turns out, eleven tricks is a lot.|pg||
nt|gracelin: especially in competition when they are unable to rebid 1NT due to lacking of stopper.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|rodal f: Less that 15-17?|pg||
nt|pelu: 3@d ask in @d - 4@C = A x(x)|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|janm: I think S has to play A and a spade here, doesn't he? |pg||
nt|cascade: he doesnt have many options|pg||
nt|cascade: he would have been better to not overruff but he didnt know that his @hK was always a winner|pg||
nt|rodal f: tan*|pg||
nt|rv: I presume South would have invited even after 1@d-1@h-1n and N-S would have reached game|pg||
nt|rodal f: than*|pg||
pc|s5|nt|fabsayc: even heart heart beats it|pg||
nt|janm: I don't know, it might be tempting to assume that West was doing the right thing and so it's necessary to play trumps to stop the second diamond ruff|pg||
nt|cascade: that works too|pg||
nt|fabsayc: oh maybe not south will be endplayed|pg||
nt|janm: I think he can make after heart & a heart, can't he - lead a spade to the K, which either gets him to dummy or endplays S|pg||
pc|sA|nt|jcwla: Meanwhile there has been way too much of this "pass and come in later" in this event -- bid it up NOW and give them uncomfortable decisions, not fielder's choices.|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|fabsayc: as long as club ace still in dummy|pg||
nt|janm: If N leads a club now, declarer has to ruff, not win the A, which may not be clear|pg||
nt|rv: With West hand, I prefer to rebid 2@d and subsequently bid 2@s or 3@s with extras (14+)|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|pelu: tx Al|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this leaves a whole lot of strength issues in doubt|pg||
pc|h3|nt|pzpp: ?|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|cascade: a heart gets him home|pg||
nt|pelu: u also need 2NT to show 16-17|pg||
nt|gracelin: a spede underlead may set 2C 3 tricks, but I doubt West will do that.|pg||
nt|gracelin: On the other hand, if West chooses to underlead DA, then only -1|pg||
nt|gracelin: maybe East shud give a clearer signal, like HJ, for West to ruff|pg||
nt|h_karluk: for newcomers, that's Round-robin, each round16 boards to VP cumulative ranking points decision|pg||
nt|gracelin: and winner of each 16 board will win a small prize of about US$150|pg||
nt|h_karluk: If the cumulative team VP would be the same, according to "Chinese Bridge Association duplicate contract bridge Judgement (Trial)" Article 14 (1) determine the rankings.|pg||
pc|hT|nt|friggi: wrong line|pg||
nt|pelu: I dont like that a ballanced 16 HCP-hand take command|pg||
pc|h4|nt|pelu: better take @cK now|pg||
pc|h7|nt|frankaus: trouble brewing|pg||
nt|henryb:  now declarer should draw trump and play a @d to the 9|pg||
nt|fabsayc: north hand too flat and too minimum for asking bids to be effective|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he had to overtake|pg||
nt|cascade: if he guesses the spade|pg||
nt|janm: No, maybe that won't work - on a clulb at this point, he can ruff, but then has to cross to the heart J and won't have a way back to his hand. But on this return, he can ruff the ...|pg||
nt|janm: low club to pull trump - oops, |pg||
nt|gracelin: most of my Chinese friends that play Precision promise 4-card D 1st/2nd hand when open 1D.|pg||
pc|s6|nt|friggi: let opps play H|pg||
nt|fabsayc: is a cute hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well -- this line doesn't work|pg||
nt|rv: I woule evauate North hand to be approx 13 hcp only|pg||
pc|s2|pc|d8|pc|s9|pg||

pc|s4|pg||
nt|gracelin: I don't|pg||
pc|d9|nt|tejjyid: bit sloppy, but anyway, still +ve|pg||

nt|h_karluk: but not today|pg||

mb|p|nt|xenya: true|pg||
nt|h_karluk: allright as that's easy maybe time to give a short brief for kibbers|pg||
nt|sundiszno: maybe only 4@h would have been better|pg||
nt|andreasw:  :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 3@C = jumping in after allowing opponents to exchange info|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i.e  why not 2@C over 1@D|pg||
nt|h_karluk: There are two generally acknowledged strengths of the strong club systems|pg||
nt|h_karluk: accuracy in uncontested slam-strength auctions, because the bidding starts at such a low level when opener has a fairly strong hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: or pass over 2@H|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and fact that all other opening bids have their strength capped by the strong club means more accurate judgment and scope for tactical operation both in constructive and ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: competitive bidding|pg||

nt|frankaus: brb|pg||
nt|friggi: but N should never play@H|pg||
nt|sybarra: club lead was key for defense |pg||
nt|janm: very tricky hand, obviously, and difficult for declarer to realize that it was necessary to do the very unintuitive thing of stranding the club A in dummy|pg||
nt|henryb:  is that desirable?|pg||
nt|pelu: no but that their system|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right -- i still don't know best line -- even looking at all hands|pg||
nt|rodal f: One thing is to precume if u show less than u have. An other thing is to show ure pard what u have.|pg||
nt|pelu: I play Cue bids grom a ballanced hand, and asking bids from the other hand  |pg||
nt|fabsayc: either that or initial control responses of some kind|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: sorry they got a bit fast then !|pg||
nt|pelu: 5@d - bit not 3NT|pg||
nt|gracelin: a close 3NT for NS.|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|ahollan1: unfav 1st/2nd = 131-15|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: or 13-15|pg||
nt|sybarra: :)|pg||
nt|rv: North's hand is close to an upgarde for 15-17 nt range|pg||
nt|barnets: north has a super max and 4@S will make|pg||
nt|rv: some might open 1@c and rebid 2n|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so the asking bids are in a range context|pg||
nt|gracelin: South will be more cautious in making his Vul. 2-level overcall|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|pelu: 1m - 1M - 3NT is the hand u show|pg||
nt|ahollan1: TRF |pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Looks like Norths diamonds vs the opps respective hearts and spades in this one|pg||
nt|pzpp: agree, players just think for a long time, then play like zip,zip, zip|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: they do not always show their cards|pg||
nt|rnmalik: np-look what a hand anything beyond 5@C by NS, the trouble starts.|pg||
nt|gracelin: probably due to fail, though.|pg||
mb|p|nt|friggi: play E for High @S |pg||
nt|friggi: let opps play @H|pg||
nt|barnets: i prefer that yes|pg||
nt|barnets: too strong for 1N|pg||
nt|henryb:  North's diamonds do not win the battle|pg||
nt|tejjyid: may be tough to decide though|pg||
nt|gracelin: another Precision auction, 1S shows a positive hand with Heart.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Good to get a board like that in early for E/W -- sets a great tone, "You will be punished if you step out of line"|pg||
mb|1S|nt|fabsayc: what system for new zealand|pg||
nt|janm: Also hard for N to realize that he needed to play the second club to cut declarer's communications :) (I'm not sure why declarer had played the heart ten though - if he hadn't he'd ...|pg||
nt|janm: have been able to overtake the heart J)|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: 4@S by E has chances but the bad break should scuttle it|pg||
nt|pelu: no - I am old Acol-player, so distribution forst - that can improve a hand - and then cue/asking|pg||
mb|p|nt|friggi: @C lead not enough|pg||
nt|sybarra: do you ever super accept with weaker nts?|pg||
nt|sybarra: I dont play them, so just asking |pg||
nt|ahollan1: i was just going to say that Newell COULD have bid 3@H as SSGT super-accept  [short suit game try]|pg||
nt|sybarra: for an older person such as me,  I would have to do too much "re-thnking" of system |pg||
nt|henryb:  Is 2@d a transfer or an amorphous force?|pg||
nt|rodal f: 4@S ok by 100% hit by the guesses. Might 3NT is better. But....|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3NT an easy make.|pg||
mb|1N|nt|rv: South will pass here in all likelihood, if he had Inv strength he would have Xed 2@c to set up forcing auction till 2n|pg||
nt|h_karluk: oh yes they want to be in NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So strong club for the boss, unlike Fu and Jack who play natural 2/1|pg||
nt|gracelin: south's 1NT is limited to 7 HCP the most, and could have less.  So north may give up.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: no overtricks in @s contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: Can't tell from the auction, can we? 1@c was alerted, as was 1@d. I'd have said we still didn't know from the alert to 1@c, but probably now it was a strong club and negative ...|pg||
nt|janm: diamond - still not certain|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i am told precision|pg||
nt|janm: And what was 2@c by East?|pg||
nt|henryb:  West now emerges with 3N?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i started old -- thinking systems has helped me regress|pg||
nt|sybarra: One Kib suggested bidding  3@H over 2@H (4 crd support, xx in @H)|pg||
nt|barnets: so n/s miss a decent game patly as a rsult|pg||
nt|rv: South chose to pass 2@c and subsequently 2@h since he suspected misfit|pg||
nt|rv: at MPs, many of us would act with South hand|pg||
nt|barnets: cant see why south did not bid 2@S|pg||
nt|xenya: 2N by N now, passing the bucket|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, you play whatever the boss plays, Roland.  Is that a rule ?|pg||
mb|2N|nt|kiwi_joker: the latter i believe|pg||
nt|rv: not my choice for 2@c opening if it shows strong hand|pg||
nt|tejjyid: still, perhaps theywill explore for 6@D and stop in !5|pg||
nt|jcwla: Uncomfortable decision now for S -- has alerady seen a much better 6-card suit than this go for 800 a level lower.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: certainly gave S, someproblems |pg||
nt|npcjpn: Facing passed partner?|pg||
nt|pelu: here my "favorit" convention (when opp play): 1NT F1 :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes|pg||
mb|3N|nt|friggi: the mistake was made by N leading @H after overtaking|pg||
nt|sybarra: N was dummy |pg||
nt|friggi: sorry|pg||
nt|sybarra: just "followed suit" |pg||
nt|friggi: dec|pg||
nt|pelu: almost 8 playing trick - and good gamble here|pg||
nt|barnets: at any scoring|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: 6H is a perfect contract for NS.  Guess NS will be there after a few cue bids.|pg||
nt|brgpro: i think he might manage 9 tricks though|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think North thinking a way to describe his hand further , ie 2N|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: After a strong club and negative diamond, I'd have thought 2@c would be natural|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not forcing, was passed hand|pg||
nt|pelu: are u sure -they have some support-hands in 1NT|pg||
nt|jcwla: CR having conn probs|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: and another challenging hand |pg||
nt|sybarra: easier for us than at the table|pg||
nt|friggi: yes, sure it is|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: indeed, this won't make|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well i am just saying i dont play it forcing in this auction|pg||
nt|gracelin: south might bid 5H over 4D to ask spade control directly|pg||
nt|h_karluk: oh yes he bid that|pg||
nt|gracelin: a Heart lead will probably beat it.  |pg||
nt|Walddk2: There is also a rule 2. If you don't agree with the boss, rule 1 will apply automatically|pg||
nt|gracelin: but West will likely lead a D, which helps declarer|pg||
nt|h_karluk: good news no specific shortage at both sides|pg||
nt|brgpro: but looks like a @D lead...|pg||
pc|d2|nt|fabsayc: apparently natual is passe|pg||
nt|pelu: here pd had the cards he need: @S-stopper, help in @H and 3 card @d so the suit is running|pg||
nt|tejjyid: to Nunn, the @H & @C valuesall look wated|pg||
nt|tejjyid: wasted|pg||
nt|pelu: Its a real top-match, Australia no 2 and Indonesia No 3, Taipie No 1|pg||
nt|gracelin: he did just that.|pg||
pc|d7|nt|fabsayc: natural|pg||
nt|barnets: n/s have the balance of points and the spade suit|pg||
nt|npcjpn: at least undoubled:)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I don't like a system where West can't show the @D support on this hand though|pg||
nt|pelu: results: http://www.nzbridgecongress.co.nz/pabf2010/Openxtab.html |pg||
nt|h_karluk: good hands good suits with cover cards|pg||
nt|brgpro: with @hQ as entry, he will do it i think|pg||
nt|gracelin: Jin gave credit to Fu's play by not passing 1NT.  Fu gave himself credit by accepting.|pg||
nt|brgpro: talking about playing with boss, Gunnar Hallberg is obvioualy an expert|pg||
pc|d9|nt|rv: good lead giving nothing away|pg||
nt|fabsayc: is one 10 in hearts from a decent game|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|friggi: that is nice:)|pg||
nt|janm: The bidding is more interesting than the play on this hand. It's out of our "ruffs to beat" set of hands, just a boring 10 top tricks, 3 losers |pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: no emotion shown !|pg||
nt|pzpp: facing 3NT, Lin had a big decision to make, his hand appears to be sourceful of tricks, just need a good @c suit and @s control to envisage slam|pg||
nt|pzpp: not sure of their agreement here, is 4NT just a general interest and natural invitation?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: ask about the 3@s bid|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  but even this helful lead doesn't mean taht play is over|pg||
nt|xenya: can be beaten if E wins and returns a @H, but tough|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  *that|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so far winning decision not much unique|pg||
pc|c6|nt|sybarra: playing J to see if he can get accurate count |pg||
nt|pelu: yes missing @H10 not so bad - need a @c-lead to defeat|pg||
pc|c3|nt|pzpp: 3@s could be just a cuebid for @s stopper for NT purpose|pg||
nt|rnmalik: all cards badly placed, other than missing 2Aces, the Q@H.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: yes opps were asking|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|brgpro: once he told me, when playing with ur boss, the first thing u shd know is not the system or convention, but how much sugar he needs for his coffee!!|pg||
nt|h_karluk: there are 2 aces and 2 Kings needs to be knocked out|pg||
nt|gracelin: Good advice.  There are something to learn everyday :)|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|friggi: this line is better the play for 3-3 @C|pg||
nt|friggi: then|pg||
nt|janm: I'm told that 2@c showed either diamonds or the Majors|pg||
nt|rv: declarer can still mis-guess all suits, generally trump lead is worthwhile if 1 hand is known to be very strong|pg||
nt|tejjyid: IMO, 3@D is mandatory aafter 2@S - assuming it's GF|pg||
nt|xenya: now declarer got a tempo |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  @h shift works even now|pg||
pc|c2|nt|rv: if South doubles 2@C and subsequently bids 2@S it is likely to be forcing, passing 2@c and bidding 2@s should be NF|pg||
pc|c7|nt|rv: South took conservative route since he suspected misfit/bad breaks|pg||
pc|c8|nt|cascade: suction|pg||
nt|pelu: I play 2@S FG, and then 3@D id the obvius bid over 2NT|pg||
nt|tejjyid: me to|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|jcwla: Meanwhile, 17 and 18 have come in -- 17 just 2 to Indonesia for staying a level lower in @H's, but 18 the big one: 14 to Indonesia for 800 here and 100 in OR against 5@HX.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Those are the type of boards that decide IMPs matches.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: 10@s played in error, penalty card|pg||
nt|xenya: to set up a club trick|pg||
nt|brgpro: even on @h shift now, wouldn't E be thrown in at the end?|pg||
nt|gracelin: maybe too late, declarer doesn't need to establish both minor suit winner, East wll be end-played at the end to yield an extra trick for declarer.|pg||
pc|h8|nt|h_karluk: Xu HOU is a World Master, in Shanghai 2007  XINYUANKONGGU - Transnational Teams, also Beijing 2008 - Transnational Teams A - EVERTRUST HOLDING GROUP were his teams|pg||
pc|h6|nt|fabsayc: that has the unattractive name of suction|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right -- i think that's what I said Shirley -- but it is not obligatory [especially with min]|pg||
nt|gracelin: of course, declarer might not know how the cards lie and may play for spades to break.|pg||
nt|gracelin: Wang, over 100-millions Wang are rooting for you to take HK.|pg||
nt|brgpro: i put up $1 for making|pg||
nt|ritong: i take|pg||
nt|ritong: hello there|pg||
nt|gracelin: I take only if East put his HK now.|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|frankaus: g2g tu all|pg||
nt|pelu: @s3 is not the system card: 1. signal Low-High = even|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Henri|pg||
nt|h_karluk: will fare wretchedly, but it's more difficult to predict as east just how badly +600 will score|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|tejjyid: buti once played fit-showing jumps as well, so I couldstart with 2@H|pg||
pc|c5|nt|tejjyid: That's a good method, but it doesn't happen often enough to take up a whole bid|pg||
pc|c9|nt|pelu: Taipei bid the slam and found their 6 trick against 3@H = 8 + 13 IMP|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|dA|nt|pzpp: to make the hand, declarer may have to take @h finesse to dispose his 1d duece|pg||
pc|d3|nt|pzpp: @d2|pg||
nt|rnmalik: The squeeze may come handy-all three vital cards are in one hand that is W.|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dK|pg||
nt|brgpro: he will play a @s now|pg||
nt|brgpro: hoping pd has the 10|pg||
pc|s2|nt|gracelin: even so, 4 round of spade will finish East.  He shud not duck HK|pg||
nt|brgpro: see? so i won from both of u !|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
pc|s7|nt|friggi: good def|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s5|pg||
nt|ritong: owe you one buck, jack|pg||
nt|h_karluk: oh yes without raising a sweat decl wld enjoy rising @st 10 or 7, then +630|pg||
nt|gracelin: not frm me, Jack, I only accept if East had put up HK.|pg||

mb|1C|mb|d|an| |nt|fabog:  1@D = 4+ hearts|pg||

nt|h_karluk: no worries pls, u served well 1st half 20 brds and a short break for another 20|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@S=11-15 HCP, 5+@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i thought he just might [keyword] start with 1@D|pg||
nt|3for3: Steve Robinson would be proud|pg||
nt|ritong: mm|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ahollan1: Danny -- you aren't the only one who mentioned Steve there|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, strange result from the other room|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 1st trick misplayed|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i meant in OR|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: but here we're in context of precision  where 1@D=1+|pg||
mb|2H|nt|3for3: and it seems to work well here, catching 4 card support|pg||
nt|geot: South has a huge hand, and in the CR he bid 5@C over 4@S in the second bidding round. No success.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: when i open 1@S -- partner's pointed suits are flip-flopped|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and after a losing @d Q hook, story over|pg||
nt|h_karluk: declarer finessed vs KQT@H at trick 1|pg||
mb|2N|nt|3for3: I'd start with 2@C then double later.  More flexible to END with double :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: http://www.bridgebum.com/multi.php|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: not quite over, but close, yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: claro que si|pg||
nt|geot: 3@S pre-emptive. Huang hopes for an ace with partner, but anyway 4@S is ok.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 2@s in original theory Inviting game in hearts if that is opener's suit, but signoff if opener's suit is spades. Opener can rebid 3@h (signoff), 4@H (signoff), or Pass with spades. ...|pg||
mb|p|pc|h3|nt|xenya: he finessed the 10 |pg||
nt|sundiszno: no, playin the 9 is good against QT and KT, and bad against KQ with the opening leader|pg||
nt|xenya: that's what i mean -- 9 is the right card |pg||
nt|sundiszno: 1@d meant 4+ @hs, a kib asked|pg||
nt|h_karluk: lead M.U.D.|pg||
nt|xenya: same thing might happen here, in theory, but i don't think it will|pg||
nt|h_karluk: declarer have the luxury losing a @d |pg||
nt|sundiszno: if east getting the lead, and plays a small @h, what will you play?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|geot: same auction. Most likely push, but there are only three top losers. |pg||
pc|h4|pc|h6|pg||
nt|3for3: when declarer tries to draw trump, his heart ruff in the dummy disappears.  can still guess hearts for 1 loser though|pg||
nt|geot: I am counting one in trumps, not practical to solve that one....|pg||
nt|ahollan1: since this is public forum i don't think i'll admit i would NOT open 1@S|pg||
nt|ritong: mm...say you draw two trumps|pg||
nt|geot: We will win 5@C:) seeing all the cards.|pg||
nt|ritong: then a top @h|pg||
nt|ritong: after that, a @h to the 8 caters with all, seems|pg||
nt|ritong: but declarer might go for @h Qj bare|pg||
nt|geot: yes|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|geot: which would have made him make the contract|pg||
nt|ritong: he does not know for sure, east could be just 5/5|pg||
nt|geot: ooops.....closer now|pg||
pc|h8|nt|geot: to solve trumps. Then he will solve hearts too|pg||
nt|fabog:  Yes, West's opening lead can be from Kxx|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: digression:  in the U26 match  after 4 comparisons Australia 15  Singapore 4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they began the match with Austalia leading by 1.33 VPs|pg||
pc|h7|nt|geot: wd!|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|3for3: One hurdle cleared|pg||
nt|ritong: home and dry now|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cA|pc|c6|nt|h_karluk: i don't think such special 2@d agreements can cause to catastrophic results|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Huang known to be on minimum, so must be distributional for @S.  since Wu 3@S bid show 4, Asbi may actually be able to read  5161 or 5251|pg||
nt|geot: He will pull the trumps now, and then low heart from dummy. When the Q comes he is practically safe by playing a low to the nine. Unless West has played the ! from Q-9.......|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry -- Henri did already say that|pg||
nt|ritong: np|pg||
nt|ritong: always good to see we agree|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i have many acquaintances who would say that it is BAD to agree with me|pg||
nt|sundiszno: weel, now it's clear |pg||
nt|h_karluk: and can be from 10xx right?|pg||
nt|fabog:  Yes,|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hQ|nt|andreasw:  should be -3 at least|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: and relatives|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|hT|nt|geot: Playing the Q from Q-9 in this situation is the only defence to make declarer go wrong. If the nine comes he will bang down the other honor and concede only one heart. |pg||
pc|s7|nt|ritong: not my point to argue, but YOU are agreeing with ME:)|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s5|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cT|nt|h_karluk: sometimes you should pick lesser evil, you know|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that 2@d - if same - the F******ry convention, which I also play with my ex club mates online|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c9|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ritong: ecco|pg||
nt|geot: Oh....got to excited....But the percentage play is to play low to the 8, I guess. |pg||
nt|geot: Nice hand!!|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ritong: now he is wondering about the Q9 stuff|pg||
pc|s9|nt|geot: yup|pg||

nt|friggi: agree|pg||
nt|henryb:  4@s or 1?|pg||
nt|sybarra: and I think S put his queen of hts in his pocket, even without the @H bid by W |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I thought -2 claim accepted|pg||
nt|h_karluk: in 2008 they were Bronze Medalists|pg||
nt|ritong: pat does not, he prudently put a condition|pg||
nt|brgpro: u dont have i am afraid, but i will be glad to take 1 euro instead|pg||
mb|1D|nt|henryb:  I would bid 4|pg||
nt|rv: have the rains stopped in South Island?|pg||
nt|gracelin: NS may get highest mark to reach 4S in a bidding contest.  Not here as West is waiting with 5-card spades.|pg||
nt|ritong: assuming you keep the lead til the end, though|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: bidding it more of a challenge now |pg||
nt|friggi: not good bid at all|pg||
nt|janm: New Zealand's IMPs came from board 2, where EW were allowed to play in 4@c and didn't make it (so that was a chance for a Hong Kong pickup if they'd gotten the spade ruff to beat ...|pg||
nt|janm: 4@h)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=ART, STR, F1, (good 13)14+ HCP unbal, 15+ HCP BAL|pg||
nt|rv: 2@c is possibly single suiter here|pg||
mb|1S|nt|janm: The Hong Kong IMPs are from board 3, where the HK N bid game over his partner's 2@s opener|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it gets stronger in 3rd/4th|pg||
nt|barnets: 3N makes for 600 against 2@DX for 500|pg||
mb|p|nt|friggi: 3@D helps opps more the p|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL=6-9 HCP|pg||
nt|pelu: partscore hand in @s or @h|pg||
nt|pzpp: NS may reach another doomed 3NT|pg||
nt|gracelin: Let's bet for bigger things.  Brazil or Italy ?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Spain|pg||
mb|1N|nt|sybarra: and E  does not have a good cue here   qx of @H's not easy |pg||
nt|sybarra: oh good E bid 5 @C |pg||
nt|pelu: U can find CC's on: http://www.pabf2010.co.nz/Participants/Convention-Cards/Open/Australia.aspx|pg||
nt|ritong: sorry about that, i m not a soccer fan|pg||
mb|p|nt|friggi: right|pg||
nt|henryb:  So did East: 4@d shows a good 4@s.|pg||
nt|pelu: also my bid - the hand is too weak to 4@D (namyats)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C takes them out of relay mode -- i think|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: meanwhile closed room seems to have gone to sleep|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Hans must have missorted his cards|pg||
nt|brgpro: Italy????? I am afraid u r not up to date patrick|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|henryb:  I think Namyats should be a better hand than that|pg||
nt|pelu: CC: just a solid suit - but I agree with u|pg||
nt|pelu: and not "solid" :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  My rules (back when I played it) was no 3-loser suit, and not two suits with two fast losers|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or maybe DBL is relay -- i'm just not sure :(|pg||
nt|rv: at any other colors, West will gleefully doube 2@d, he is likely to bid 3n at these colors|pg||
nt|pelu: Grant like to bid - but he has no bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: but, as R does, i would be glad to see spain winning it|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|sybarra: is this a slam that is biddable?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it is very possible that 3@H=exact shape|pg||
nt|rodal f: The lead at match and team is? not @C but thrumph.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the all seasons double comes to his rescue|pg||
nt|pelu: a slow X = pd my distribution is not OK :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: now should pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzkt: nope :(|pg||
nt|pzpp: I think that Mr. Lin had a misunderstanding of this 3@c|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: thinking|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i guess 2@h wld be nice instea of 2@c|pg||
mb|2H|nt|sybarra: 3 @D bid not recommended at home |pg||
nt|sybarra: or maybe only at home LOL|pg||
nt|friggi: agree|pg||
nt|friggi: helps W to count that hands|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe "we" are on our way |pg||
nt|ahollan1: so YES Shirley|pg||
nt|tejjyid: itsvery disciplined to take 2 passes on that hand; mabe he will balance over 3@H?|pg||
nt|gracelin: The whole Xinyuan team represented China in the 47th PABF championships played in New Zealand in late May.|pg||
nt|gracelin: NS play a 10-12 mini-1NT opening. |pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: 3@s presumably Smolen, showing a game force with 4 spades and 5 hearts, so that partner can play the hand in hearts; they know they don't have an 8 card fit in spades already|pg||
nt|fabsayc: what to lead|pg||
nt|janm: 3NT is going to be very difficult to make here|pg||
nt|rv: E-W playing negative doubles and forcing pass till 2n after double by West to set up forcing auction|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Kaz Yamada|pg||
nt|npcjpn: now the lead is very important.|pg||
nt|rodal f: How many have missed how many times there:)|pg||
nt|xenya: 4@H here|pg||
nt|gracelin: I accept Italy if the stakes are right, say 1 : 100.|pg||
mb|4H|nt|cascade: what do you lead from Miller's hand knowing that declarer is probably 4=3 in spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2 Key Cards + @HQ|pg||
nt|sybarra: but when I bid these,  hts are always 4/1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: lucky -- mine 5-0|pg||
nt|ahollan1: AND @S king offside|pg||
nt|kaz08833: hi all|pg||
nt|fabsayc: we are toungue in cheek with our comments, folks|pg||

nt|vugraphzkt: no emotion !|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: someone's tummy is rumbling here !|pg||
nt|rnmalik: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: seen the hand maybe !|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: i might lead spades as the least destructive|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: I like this treatment as well, prefer positive doubles if we have bid a 4+ card suit naturally and on a similar forcing auction|pg||
nt|npcjpn: nice lead.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: another long think|pg||
nt|tejjyid: There's some serious underbidding going on here|pg||
pc|s5|nt|rv: East-West should time such defenses very well, need to combine punching declarer and remove his trumps|pg||
nt|barnets: if e/w tap dec he will make 4 @D tricks and a club|pg||
nt|pelu: why didn't S bid 3@D ?|pg||
nt|pelu: ven here its a make|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sybarra: pity the trumps dont break (just a joke) |pg||
nt|sybarra: yep k off,  I will let you play the 5/0 breaks, and count my blessings|pg||
nt|rodal f: But always 110EW|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ritong: probably they have a two wayed checkback, so 2@c initiates an invite|pg||
nt|ritong: however, it would work the same way with a one way stuff|pg||
nt|h_karluk: would it be a normal +620 or not, we will see how decl would tackle trumps|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|janm: Hard to know what to lead, I agree; although leading a 5 card suit is often right, when it's a bad suit and dummy has 4 of them... So I think he's probably right to try to find ...|pg||
nt|janm: partner's suit, just unlucky that he chose the wrong minor|pg||
nt|barnets: if they dont tap he makes 3@D tricks and 2 clubs|pg||
nt|rv: b|pg||
nt|rodal f: y better|pg||
nt|pelu: I am not sure I would have bid on the East-hand|pg||
nt|gracelin: or 2C forces 2D, either to pass 2D or start an invitational sequence.|pg||
nt|xenya: looks hopeless?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i suspect|pg||
nt|h_karluk: it will score very well|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: this seems to need 3-2 trump and nothing awful in @S|pg||
nt|kaz08833: it will go down 3 at least if E misguesss d|pg||
pc|h3|nt|henryb:  He can make this, I think. @h to Q, @d|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so Great Shuffler on declarer's side this hand|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Only the Vul would make me think twice|pg||
nt|gracelin: a good steal.  No reason for West to elad a Diamond.|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hA|pg||
nt|rodal f: @SJ and|pg||
nt|rv: strange play by both West and North|pg||
nt|rodal f: Might vug maded wrong at the @S. |pg||
nt|rv: low @h from dummy could even lead to 10 tricks now|pg||
nt|rodal f: But he/she will come with a correct result.|pg||
pc|c4|nt|gambit: cl already 6 or 7|pg||
nt|rv: min of 9 tricks for E-W|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: big think|pg||
pc|cK|nt|pelu: DD u can make 4@S by playing @D in trick 2 - but then u need to see all 52 cards|pg||
pc|c6|nt|fabsayc: if you can rely on double promising hearts he made the normal bid|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|xenya: 2 more trumps and @CA for the defence|pg||
nt|h_karluk: given all the things that could lead to a very different result|pg||
pc|h4|nt|sybarra: one sigh of relief so far |pg||
nt|pelu: NS's NT 1. and 2 : (11)12-14 - 3. and 4. : 14-17|pg||
pc|h8|nt|h_karluk: easy 9 tricks now|pg||
pc|hK|nt|rv: here even double dummy, South can't be stopped from making 5 tricks as rightly pointed by Barnet|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Exactly, although dummy had shown four spades on the auction I suppose|pg||

pc|c3|pc|cA|nt|3for3: reverse flannery in the other room to get to 2@S from the short side|pg||

nt|janm: I was wondering about that too - I don't see how he could have done that, but does declarer really have time to set up a club? Say he leads the club Q, now what? North has better ...|pg||
nt|janm: club spots than declarer|pg||
nt|sybarra: note the spade suit play |pg||
nt|rv: strong start by Aus pair in this room|pg||
nt|rv: series of good boards|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: and that won't be a great result for China either|pg||
nt|rv: steady start by new Caledonia here, no drops so far from bottom placed team in the table|pg||
nt|pelu: a kiwi surrender - never :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: grant said good choice of suit !|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Testing hands.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: good point Shirley -- must admit that i missed the safety play :(|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=3-10 HCP, 4+@S & 4+@C/@D|pg||
mb|1N|nt|fabsayc: but defense does not have enough tricks then|pg||
nt|janm: Declarer has 2 spades, 2 hearts, 2 diamonds (if he uses the club and heart aces for diamond finesses), 1 club, he really can't find 2 more tricks, can he?|pg||
nt|rv: no one likes to finish last and lose too many matches, pride of every bridge player|pg||
nt|tejjyid: They were in 4? OK, I take back my underbidding crack|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: sorry missed a bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: ehaa......for the S bid |pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry  2-8 HCP  --  i should copy/paste instead of trying to use recall|pg||
nt|sybarra: might be their system others call it Every, Hand An Adventure (EHAA)|pg||
nt|pzpp: precision 2@c|pg||
nt|gracelin: another Precision auction might see NS stop at 2S here|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|fabsayc: not sure|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: nice 4@S for the NZers here (even 3NT makes)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: and naturally interesting to watch-no play:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: i think so|pg||
nt|tejjyid: NP, these guys are prety quick, I imagine|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: battle of spades and hts, |pg||
nt|barnets: 3N and 4@S both make here|pg||
mb|2H|nt|sybarra: and 4 @H's always "transfers" to 4 @S (for opps) |pg||
nt|cascade: i just checked double dummy and GIB thinks Miller needed to find the @c8 to defeat 3NT|pg||
nt|janm: Defense might get endplayed out of one trick, but 2? Hard to tell. And of course it isn't easy to lead the club Q either, just easier than leading low|pg||
nt|janm: But GIB lets declarer play double dummy too|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EHAA was never this creative|pg||
nt|kaz08833: 9 tricks plaing \s by NS, 8 tricks playing \D by EW|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They stopped in 1NT next door on 6, and that was all they could make as North was declarer|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: 2@s seems a gross under-bid here|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: ooops|pg||
nt|Walddk2: East had an easy diamond lead|pg||
mb|2N|nt|kiwi_joker: they really needed to find out about the nice secondary fit in @Ds to bid this one|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: yes very|pg||
nt|tejjyid: If that tempo reflected the table, I don't think much of it|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: thinking|pg||
mb|p|nt|friggi: should do|pg||
nt|friggi: ??|pg||
nt|sybarra: well indeed that is true!|pg||
nt|rv: it is normally played as Invitational strength 8-9/10 hcp even with 4@s|pg||
nt|gracelin: we see again a GF 2D inquiry.|pg||
mb|3C|nt|janm: Ah, here we see science in action (not!)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well if 2s is minimum is quite reasonable|pg||
nt|sybarra: I only played it in midnight swisses|pg||
nt|barnets: you put the hex on australia|pg||
nt|rv: interesting contract to play and defend, I expect defense to prevail here|pg||
nt|rodal f: -1 and next? but normal bidding.|pg||
nt|pelu: In my book the N hand is too strong to splinter|pg||
nt|tejjyid: North should KNOW what he is doing over a 4@H cue when he bids 4@D|pg||
nt|h_karluk: USA EDT 00:30, 02:45, 05:00 there will be 16x3=48 boards in 3 rounds, stay with us please, that's a very nice broadcast|pg||
mb|p|nt|cascade: 2@s will be minimum|pg||
nt|janm: They got to the right spot of course, but does N really know that his partner can't have enough for 7? Make the diamond Q the club Q for instance|pg||
nt|fabsayc: might gain by not helping defense to lead|pg||
nt|cascade: i am pretty sure they dont play 2/1 FG|pg||
nt|fabsayc: remember is precision|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: sorry there is no commentary here|pg||
mb|3N|nt|fabsayc: so 2s is definitely limited|pg||
nt|npcjpn: 3@s is not invitational, so pass looks automatic.|pg||
nt|rv: @h ruff or 2@s tricks in addition to 2 tricks each in @hs and @cs|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: yes precision 2@c|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: 11-15|pg||
nt|gracelin: 10 tricks will be made if defenders force declarer to ruff the 3rd club.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Most West's will open 1N in a club-system and east will give GF responds |pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: with 5@s and super-max for passed hand, I would have started with 2@h with West hand|pg||
nt|rv: lol|pg||
nt|barnets: as they miss a good game especially on th e bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: Even if 2/1 isn't FG, couldn't he at least bid 2@c and then blackwood and tell his partner they had all the keycards and adequate trumps - S would know that AQx of clubs was golden|pg||
nt|rv: commentator's curse as Barnet rightly put it:)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if lead is fourth best, start looking elsewhere|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: fearing Heart ruffs, declarer may still play A, K of trumps to drop the SQ|pg||
pc|sK|nt|rv: can even be 2 down now|pg||
nt|h_karluk: slam is not out of the question from East's pouint of view facing a sound opening bid with long diamonds|pg||
nt|h_karluk: however preferred to stay in 3N|pg||
pc|sA|nt|tejjyid: and SOuth does not have enough to bid over a signoff, IMO|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, so he explored further after the 2H response.|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pg||
nt|fabsayc: there is no elsewhere but you do look|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that'|pg||
pc|dK|nt|janm: Of course he doesn't have that, but he could have|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my last Regional event on East Coast I came in 2nd in Masters Pair with one of the Authors of EHAA -- Eric Landau|pg||
pc|d5|nt|janm: Or a sixth spade|pg||
nt|sybarra: were you playing that system?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|pelu: better J to kill @HK as entry for the 4. @d|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|h_karluk: s true sir|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d8|pc|dA|nt|pelu: I would never lead @D against 3NT - normal a @H and have @DA as entry or a shot in @S|pg||
nt|h_karluk: no way to get rid of 2 @c losers|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|fabsayc: all true but sometimes no science is better|pg||
nt|rodal f: @H10 drop auto. Can't miss 7 tr.|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dJ|nt|henryb:  I think a @h is standout. not that it makes a difference on this hand|pg||
nt|barnets: maybe west should bid 3@S|pg||
nt|barnets: over the X|pg||
nt|rv: NS missed an opportunity to take a @h ruff followed by another @c ruff with @SK to come|pg||
nt|rv: now only 1 down with @HT coming down|pg||
nt|fabsayc: indeed defense is playing hand for declarer|pg||
nt|gracelin: no, but declarer may only lose 2C + 1D|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|kaz08833: S might guess /s wrong|pg||
nt|rnmalik: good approach.|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|gracelin: guess 10 tricks too here|pg||
pc|d9|nt|fabsayc: say defense needs to cash two clubs|pg||
nt|fabsayc: which is equally likely|pg||
nt|gracelin: now I thk declarer will drop SQ and make 11 tricks with two D discards|pg||
nt|h_karluk: oops, now dec wld b able to draw 2 rnds top @s and pitch @c losers|pg||

mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: But for sure Gyorgy and Gabor have some slight different hand evaluation|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ahollan1: in big club context it also helps with  opener holding 14(35)|pg||
nt|geot: A club lead will set 3NT on this one. And declarer must finesse the ten in diamonds to win. Strong 630 in the CR.|pg||
nt|geot: Spade lead is normal.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@D WAS game force -- i wonder why 2@H on that terrible 5 card suit instead of natural 2@S |pg||

nt|tejjyid: not bad|pg||
nt|xenya: there was a fierce partscore battle in the other room |pg||

mb|p|nt|janm: I suppose there could be QJ in front of the K and A over it, but I don't think bidding scientifically will make it any easier for them to find that|pg||
nt|cascade: they have another chance to showcase their slam bidding|pg||
nt|pelu: see NSs problem after 4@s|pg||
nt|henryb:  somewhat difficult to get to 6@h-- maybe less difficult when West chooses not to open a large number of spades|pg||

nt|xenya: seems a wheel has come off|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sybarra: oh oh |pg||
nt|sybarra: but can W lead a @D easily|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 6c is better|pg||
nt|pelu: ok a bidding: 4@s P P 4NT - then 5@C (or 6@C) by N and 5/6@D by S = 2 siuter in red|pg||
nt|sybarra: may not be best spot|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Newell had option to bid 3@C showing MAX with longer @C|pg||
nt|barnets: Q|pg||
pc|s7|nt|rv: South's action is surely too timid though it is hardly clearcut to bid at 5 level|pg||
nt|barnets: would show  the @HA|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|cascade: anyway the answer was yes easily|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 6@D likely down if diamonds 4-1|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 6@C would still have chances|pg||
nt|kaz08833: with other Q N shd pass it's unfortunate judge by N|pg||
nt|rodal f: Auto @S hook and a 50% @D hook for 10in @S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: perhaps but they have bid my multi suit a few times, and i am still spending the winnings|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 15% probabilty 5-1 break|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|kiwibridge: the slam was NOT found so 13 well earned imps to CT|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: I kinda blame Stout a bit here .. he has chance to bid 3@C, which would have pushed pd's buttons (and they would never defend 5@Dx then)|pg||
nt|rv: I would pass 2@s with West hand, no Invite with 7 hcp, bid game only if partner super-accepts|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i was wondering how that 3@H bid would backfire|pg||
nt|pelu: in US and ? canada - the defense against Multi is not so commen as in Europe|pg||
pc|h8|nt|sybarra: might see china gain some imps here|pg||
nt|tejjyid: slams all make with @S Qx in North|pg||
nt|jcwla: You might say...|pg||
pc|h5|nt|sybarra: with the opening bid,  not easily |pg||
nt|ahollan1: that brings up point of extreme trivia - i was given URL that explains origin of "schneid"  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20061024124644AA8yaYF|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 3-3 36%. 4-2 48 %|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|janm: I assume all of this was natural after 1@c and 1@d, and 3@s is some sort of attempt to find NT|pg||
nt|janm: 6NT won't be a success|pg||
nt|henryb:  Would North's pass be forcing? I do not think so. And North could have much less, say AKJxxx in clubs and out|pg||
nt|fabsayc: where do we locate BBO|pg||
nt|pelu: :)|pg||
nt|xenya: what was 2@S, Jack? |pg||
pc|d8|nt|fabsayc: oh is this blackwood|pg||
nt|rodal f: At the -edge for W but...|pg||
pc|d5|nt|janm: Surely if N jumps to 6@c, S should let him play there |pg||
nt|fabsayc: i would have bid 4@C over 3nt|pg||
nt|janm: I think 4NT is just a quantitative slam try, not Blackwood|pg||
nt|fabsayc: club queen has to be a big card|pg||
nt|cascade: south did well to move with no aces|pg||
nt|janm: Yes, but S seems to be thinking along NT lines, also if he bid 4@c wouldn't that make it sound as if 3@s was a cue bid?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Took it out.|pg||
nt|rv: West should surely pass 3@s after his invite|pg||
nt|jcwla: Always max pressure from the Indonesian pair -- no free space -- a winning style.|pg||
pc|dK|nt|barnets: well done|pg||
nt|pelu: for sure Herr exp a better hand by partner|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i have to fight everytime to play it live, mostly recently last weekend|pg||
nt|tejjyid: if theat 4 HCP is 2 Q's, East can stop here|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i liked the unscientific auction better|pg||
nt|janm: Of course, N has a minimum and a void in partner's suit, so even with that nice 6-card suit and 3 aces, it's not unreasonable for him to pass|pg||
nt|pelu: here in denmark even "the old ladies" play Multi :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the final ruling was the event strength of the weakest team was over 8000 master points so multi allowable|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i swear this is true|pg||
nt|fabsayc: as opposed to my usual embellishments|pg||
nt|pelu: I trust u - and here we find that atitude vert strange (mild expression :))|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: big think and sigh|pg||
nt|h_karluk: likely pass or pull?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|cascade: Stout does have spade stoppers but the @sAK and the rest of his hand are also suitable for slam|pg||
nt|janm: This one wasn't really very scientific either :)|pg||
nt|rv: he has bid his hand to the hilt by showing 5@s and 8-9 hcp|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 4NT quantative, I assume, so Nunn can cue@C |pg||
nt|h_karluk: only a favorable placed K is @h, rest offside|pg||
pc|s5|nt|vugraphzkt: wants to lead @h|pg||
pc|c2|nt|vugraphzkt: changes mind|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|gracelin: won't take long to bring home 10 tricks|pg||
nt|brgpro: i would pass 2@h|pg||
nt|ritong: according to patrick, it was just hand hogging|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so EW will usually remain silent|pg||
nt|gracelin: Fu doesn't know which suit is longer in Jin's hand.  He could either pass 2H or to play 2S, I tk he chose 2S also because his hand may want to compete to 3h if opponent balance.|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s8|nt|ahollan1: final scores for Round Robin  1 are posted -- http://www.nzbridgecongress.co.nz/pabf2010/Openxtab.html|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: trying to work out p's hand !|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: screen down !|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: paper discussion|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: screen up away we go|pg||
nt|jcwla: So one in each side suit and one of Rodal's coffee break boards.|pg||
pc|s6|nt|pelu: I exp that @s are trump (4@c = cue bid with @s)|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|h3|nt|rodal f: By non vul u are so right RV. At vul I would bid 4 100 by 100 times after 3@S from pard|pg||
nt|rv: he can make this contract if he guesses everything correctly though|pg||
nt|rodal f: 2NT might a bit hard from Brison, but his pards problem.|pg||
nt|rv: needs to avoid double finesse in @s which he has successfully negotiated, next needs to play @cs twice towards dummy and then guess @d diamonds as well|pg||
nt|tejjyid: hmmph|pg||
pc|h2|nt|janm: This is actually probably a hand that would be easier to bid in a natural system - N would start with 1@c and later be able to show a good hand.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: China began RR2 in 4th, NZ 7th|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Grant-Ker did get to 4@H on previous hand|pg||
nt|pelu: but the 5@d bid I have no expl - even a guees|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|barnets: intersting on a diamond lead|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|cascade: well they get to a similar situation after 1@c 1@h; 2@d 3@d ...|pg||
nt|janm: So making 5 or 6 depending on whether they cash the heart A now|pg||
nt|henryb:  in which case South might go down at the five level when the opponents were down in 4@s|pg||
nt|rv: well defended, still could be a loss since 5@d makes for NS|pg||
nt|barnets: to see if dc could make it|pg||
nt|h_karluk: haha|pg||
pc|sA|nt|tejjyid: I canot fathom 5@D - 0 Aces in 1430?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|janm: Somewhat similar I suppose, but the S hand would have shown a better hand at that point and N could then bid 3@s to pattern out. I don't know, I just hear comments about how much ...|pg||
nt|janm: easier some hand would be in a strong club system so often, I can't resist when it doesn't help at all and might even hurt|pg||
pc|c3|nt|fabsayc: could not afford this line|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now spade 8 setting trick|pg||
nt|pelu: well played - but the informativ X help|pg||
nt|fabsayc: needed to cross ruff to shorten his trumps|pg||
nt|pelu: no setting trick, @C ruff (@s3), @D to King, @C-ruff @DA and @D last trick on @SJ|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|fabsayc: of your right he still has time|pg||
nt|xenya: does that mean that N had to correct to 3@H?|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c6|nt|h_karluk: not really|pg||
pc|c9|nt|pelu: spec - help us - u are total silent :)|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|gracelin: no, north has shown both majors with the 2H opening.  South picks the trums.|pg||
nt|gracelin: trumps|pg||
nt|xenya: right, thanks|pg||
nt|gracelin: now a trump will squeeze south who must abandon his H, then either minor can end-play declarer for -2|pg||
pc|dA|nt|tejjyid: Why 4N would be BW tho, I can't imagine|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d9|nt|sybarra: and I am sure E would like to have said X agter the hand however that could backfire |pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: hmmmm|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|pelu: no the help came: 5@D = 0 Aaces - 4NT = 1430|pg||
pc|d7|nt|tejjyid: 5@H asking for @S Q|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dJ|nt|sybarra: need a mirror to know pard has q of @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: scrambled 6 tricks|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||

pc|hT|pc|s9|pc|h6|pc|h7|pg||

nt|xenya: he had a guess there admittedly|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think S shld open|pg||
nt|xenya: yet another excellent slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: even 6N|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabog:  1@C = strong|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, in 3 denominations|pg||
mb|2C|nt|ritong: wu: "quiet, me??":)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: bzzzt  sorry, but thank you for playing our game|pg||
nt|fabog:  3@D = 5+ hearts 2+ controls, positive|pg||
nt|sundiszno: some kind of rubensohl here?|pg||
nt|xenya: might not be easy to reach it though after the intervention|pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: Karwur passed at the other table. Ended up scoring 590|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 6@d, 6@h. 6N, have no idea which one best under table pressure|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|2H|nt|ahollan1: what an incredible dummy to buy there|pg||
nt|ritong: thank you, pard|pg||
nt|xenya: looks impossible now?|pg||
nt|sundiszno: but anyway, 4@s is 800|pg||
nt|xenya: well who know|pg||
nt|h_karluk: well i think opp teams would play modified truscott|pg||
nt|xenya: *knows|pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: I guess a 4@S opening will get many votes too. A practical bid. |pg||
mb|p|nt|fabog:  pass from W = i prefer playing instead of defence|pg||
nt|xenya: and 5@D?|pg||
nt|fabog:  3-suited hand with 3-4 controls and shortness in spades|pg||
nt|xenya: that's what he has indded |pg||
mb|3C|nt|ahollan1: notice DBL is NOT pure penalty as in previous millenium|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabog:  If W understood it right, he must have bid 6 diamonds|pg||
nt|xenya: W is not on the same wavelength?|pg||
mb|3H|nt|fabog:  5 hearts is passable|pg||
nt|h_karluk: such as in Modified Truscott: 1 level bids are natural and weak single suiters,  X shows clubs, 1NT is clubs and hearts, 2C is clubs and diamonds,  2D is diamonds and hearts, 2H is ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hearts and spades, 2S is spades and clubs, 2NT is spades and diamonds    |pg||
mb|3S|nt|xenya: he must have misunderstood the 5@D bid|pg||
nt|fabog:  yes, i think so|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: often over 4@S    DBL="transferrable values"  4N=2-suit takeout|pg||
nt|geot: Declarer must not try to be clever in hearts....He does not know the nice lay-out|pg||
nt|ritong: north is supposed to hold 4@hs|pg||
nt|geot: May be tempting to play South for ie. 9-x, ten from hand. |pg||
nt|ahollan1: south is supposed to hold east's hand|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: but when he will appear to hold 2 @ss, this idea of 4 cards in @hs will decrease|pg||
mb|p|pc|h3|pc|h2|pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||

nt|janm: The reason I think the strong club might hurt on this hand is more psychological than real - N starts out thinking he has a minimum and doesn't revise that idea|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the vague 3s and 4nt did them in|pg||
nt|janm: Another void opposite partner's long Major!|pg||
nt|cascade: he is minimum until he finds a fit|pg||
nt|cascade: then he has a very slam suitable hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: My guess is N/S feel good about their game, but not as good as it  will score up |pg||
nt|rodal f: So after the board: That was not as I would have done it. If E goes dow. And WD if home:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: internet connection a bit slow here|pg||
nt|tejjyid: so slam is at best 50%|pg||
nt|h_karluk: normal|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: on @d lead, declarer pitches a @h, draws a round of trumps and plays a @c out|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Ino need to pass I feel, it usually goes wrong when you bid with that and Q@S was a good trump|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: wow - some interesting deals today|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: I know, but I just think that it's easier to recognize that if you start out thinking you have a lot in reserve for your opening bid :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Li-Liu in 10@C on  24|pg||
nt|sybarra: and 1 @S is transfer opening again |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S=ART, 9-13 HCP, unbal, 4+@D, not 4+@H/@S a) 6+@D  b) @D & @C [maybe longer @C]|pg||
nt|pzpp: an easy 4@s?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: On the face of it 4@S for EW, can go overboard.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: S is thinking !|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: still counting his pts !|pg||
nt|pzpp: S thinking? they play Precision, partner's 1@d bid may have no great length to boast about|pg||
mb|1S|nt|cascade: yes he is rewarded with another 6430 - what are the card gods saying?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S=@S    go figure|pg||
nt|barnets: e can pitch a heart from dummy and protect against a ruff|pg||
nt|pelu: before this match: Taipie No 1 and NZ No6 - oout of 13|pg||
nt|gracelin: the 10-12 NT again|pg||
nt|h_karluk: distributional hand|pg||
mb|2C|nt|cascade: perhaps you are right|pg||
nt|janm: After 1@h-1@s-2@h will S let partner play the hand?|pg||
nt|sybarra: geesh,  a real bid of a suit!! |pg||
nt|barnets: right|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: late alert|pg||
nt|fabsayc: really 1@D by west?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: with so many tricks or points, why is he thinking?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: yikes|pg||
mb|2D|nt|rv: precision auction here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: playing with house money|pg||
mb|2N|nt|janm: I think we had a discussion in another match about rebidding 2@h vs 2@c on hands like N's - what do you both think (you know what I think)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@H-4@H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.ccba.org.cn/Tour/TourIndex.aspx?tourid=255  for the tournament website in Chinese Simplified; use Google for translation|pg||
mb|3H|nt|rv: is 2@c right bid? is strong hand transferring here?|pg||

mb|p|nt|janm: I think you're about to get the prediction prize for the match!|pg||

nt|vugraphzkt: now saying some prayers|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: no inspiration forth coming |pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: now looking to the sky|pg||
nt|rnmalik: For discussion sake why did W not DBL 5@D?|pg||
nt|pzpp: anything there, I mean, in your sky?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: down to the floor !|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: rain|pg||

nt|pzpp: rain, great, German says rain brings luck|pg||
nt|jcwla: This can't be the right M.O.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: reopening needed|pg||
nt|gracelin: north chose to double in other room, so south had an easy 4H bid.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i liked that 2@d|pg||
nt|h_karluk: tho passed hand|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 10 HCP, shortage in opener suit but showed his source of tricks|pg||
nt|gracelin: agree, but may not help to reach 4H with the 2D response.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: also true|pg||
nt|gracelin: north might play south for fifth Heart, since north has denied 4H when he bid 2D.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: anyways 3@h good decision|pg||
nt|gracelin: Good decision is to reach 4H :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and i doubt most would bid 2N, i guess even 3@c would be a minority vote|pg||
nt|h_karluk: just 7 hcp on vul vs nonvul and gives much info to opps|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  apparently E-W play a variable NT; weak nv and sound(er) vul|pg||
nt|babs59: Hi.  Please don't jinx them Barnet|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Stout will be waiting for his heart ruff at trick 2.   Bad news, Graeme  :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: Another steal. East shud double the 1NT opening to get in.  |pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: 10 and next|pg||
nt|pelu: 5 tricks in 1@H - so not so bad|pg||
nt|tejjyid: time for a quick coffee. On that lead, this will make buckets|pg||
pc|cA|nt|cascade: NZ gained another 11 IMPs on  5 when Grant Ker found a good 4@s dive which went undoubled!!!|pg||
nt|rv: ah this makes more sense|pg||
nt|kaz08833: NS only have to take 6 tricks or even 7 because EW can make 4@s|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sybarra: and a std. @S lead |pg||
nt|fabsayc: depends a lot on spots, here i totally agree with 2@H rebid|pg||
nt|pelu: yes 11-14 and 15-17|pg||
nt|pelu: good Acol-style|pg||
nt|rv: wlc Barbara, as neutrals we would like a much closer match:)|pg||

nt|jaheim: t|pg||
pc|c4|nt|cascade: well i dont know what you think|pg||

nt|rodal f: Sad|pg||
nt|pelu: 500/430|pg||
nt|fabsayc: kind of like paying to see the hidden cards in poker|pg||
nt|gracelin: East was very serious with West's unf Vul. 2-over 1 overcall. but yes, 2NT had little to do with his hand.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: :)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|vugraphzkt: brief flurry of action|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|cascade: but i typically bid the six card suit unless there is a major disparity in the suit strength|pg||
nt|fabsayc: actually defense could slip and allow down 1|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|pg||
nt|sybarra: n/s system should not be tried for novices....  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: and isn't even almost allowed in ACBL|pg||
nt|sybarra: and I do not know a defense to it|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe defense is just bid your longest suit |pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: Hou is examining the system card|pg||
nt|sybarra: but the "down unders"  (Aus and NZ) have always been "creative"  |pg||
nt|pelu: yes - not my style - but on the other hand - I dont like to see a long relay-bidding by opp|pg||
pc|s5|nt|rv: this should get beaten|pg||
nt|babs59: of course, I've just noticed his name showing as Paul Gill, but it's Peter Gill, and he's my brother|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sybarra: probably thinking S lead from kxxx|pg||
nt|barnets: maybe he should duck the @D|pg||
nt|barnets: another @D|pg||
nt|barnets: knocks out the ace|pg||
nt|rv: yes that would be a good deceptive play especially at trick 1|pg||

pc|s9|nt|cascade: Michael Lawrence had some advice for 6=4s which i read many years ago|pg||
nt|janm: I think it's automatic to rebid the 6 card major with a relatively weak hand, but I've been told that's old fashioned :). Glad to hear some support|pg||
nt|jcwla: E/W quietly cede the lead here.|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|henryb:  Not the Acol I know. that is weak throughout|pg||
nt|rv: has a very good chance of working especially if West returns @D3 which may be difficult to read|pg||

pc|d9|pc|d2|nt|cascade: his advice was with 6=4 rebid the suit with the most high card points|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe |pg||
nt|babs59: board 7 where Gill and Gosney missed game, OR  West opened 1S and passed partner's 1NT response (surely forcing?)|pg||
nt|babs59: so it was a flat board|pg||
nt|rv: declarer should have possibly cashed 4@cs instead of playing 3rd @d|pg||
nt|rv: that would have forced West to make 2 pitches and he might have got it wrong|pg||
nt|rodal f: If any are long at @H it's W. Play @H for the Q|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jcwla: But this has been their style throughout -- "maybe if we wish and hope and pray it might come true" -- that Indonesia will stay out -- but they don't, so get where you're going ...|pg||

mb|2C|nt|ahollan1: i wonder if alert of DBL is  a) 16+ HCP  or   b) takeout of @H|pg||
mb|d|nt|h_karluk: 5@h+2@s+1@d right?:)|pg||
nt|fabog:  lol|pg||
nt|h_karluk: lol|pg||
nt|sundiszno: seeing @cAKQxxx in his hand, is it a good idea?|pg||
nt|sundiszno: if there is not a club lead, you can strip the majors, and give south a @c, to lead away from @dK, as a kib suggests|pg||
nt|h_karluk: well, in my 1st club tournament tho i finished it with 58%, i passed my pertner's cue tho i agreed it as fit+gf, but that was 36 years ago, that 3NT would be quite friendly ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: neighbor defense|pg||
mb|3C|nt|sundiszno: but it doesnt workk since North also cvan win the @c|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|fabog:  1 think 4 club means hearts|pg||

nt|h_karluk: 5@d fine, no way slam, unless @c lead there at trick 1|pg||
nt|xenya: hearts?? -- well yes, he has four of them... |pg||
nt|h_karluk: 4@h also saves the day|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: 1N questionable|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: passed p may be a deterrent factor to look for a slam|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sundiszno: passed on 3@s|pg||
nt|h_karluk: however that 4@s might lead wrong|pg||
nt|h_karluk: showed extras|pg||
nt|fabog:  OK, so 4@C was asking bid, 4@H = 4-5 hearts, 4@S asking again|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|nt|fabog:  4NT = 5-card hearts|pg||
nt|h_karluk: csatlos did you play gambling 3N with Hittman?|pg||
nt|fabog:  yes|pg||
nt|h_karluk: then i think 4@c pass or pull|pg||
nt|xenya: i fear EW are going to have another misunderstanding but of course i'm not in a position to judge |pg||
nt|fabog:  but not in this situation|pg||
nt|sundiszno: 3NT is not gambling here|pg||
nt|h_karluk: quasi|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and i have no idea why 4@c not doubled|pg||
nt|xenya: good point|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @s lead might cost them expensive in case they landed 6|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's not questionable if 1@S would have shown an unbalanced hand. Many play that|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ok ty|pg||

nt|xenya: well now S can afford to be brillant by ducking 1st @D? |pg||
pc|c3|pc|c9|nt|Walddk4: Yes, looks like 2@C is a puppet to 2@D, then 2@S invitational with 4-4 in the majors|pg||
nt|vugraphzmz: yes:)|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d3|pc|d5|nt|pelu: the only lead that give defense a chance to miss the defense - better play low from dummy|pg||
nt|andreasw:  :)|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|geot: Again a hand where the hand records/GIB will tell that 4@S is makeable. But that does not mean it is bridge|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ahollan1: presumably 3@H says Asbi is willing for Tobing to correct to 3@S -- so Wu not excited with his hand|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c8|pg||
pc|hA|nt|geot: Often the maximum tricks available told us by GIB can only be made by playing against the odds.|pg||

mb|1C!|nt|pelu: 11 tricks in @h/@d for EW - 5@C would be expensive for NS|pg||

nt|sybarra: did it mean specially wk @D's?|pg||
nt|sybarra: *specifically |pg||

nt|jcwla: 22 and 23 pushes in 2@S making 3 and 3NT making 4, respectively.|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: how does this tourney work ?|pg||
nt|itinerant: 2S = 4+clubs, 5+ spades|pg||

mb|2N|nt|alchilds: no low =2|pg||

nt|gracelin: closed room EW made a wise stop at 3S, Club ruff beats 4S.  Same here.|pg||
mb|p|nt|friggi: agree|pg||
nt|janm: He knows he probably has the best hand at the table, but that doesn't necessarily translate into the ability to take 8 tricks|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not 2@D|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Amanda, Henry, Peter|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yes @D preempt|pg||

nt|vugraphzkt: tight match so far|pg||
nt|h_karluk: interesting 4@h, the question how to reach|pg||
nt|gracelin: provided there is no accident|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Indeed, you need to be very unlucky to go down in 7NT, but it is possible on certain layouts|pg||
mb|3H|nt|janm: Well, he pushed them one higher, so I guess he was right|pg||
nt|fabsayc: maybe double|pg||
nt|barnets: do the top 8 play off or top 4?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: you can guess I play few partscores|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: But DBL should surely suggest some club length, shouldn't it?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2d suggests better diamonds|pg||
nt|fabsayc: double allows for 1nt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D/@H are Transfer Preempts -- only 3@C is nat pre|pg||
nt|babs59: Paul Gosney has also qualified for the Australian Under 26 team - which meant that for NZ PABF he has been replaced in the team|pg||
mb|3N|nt|janm: True, but I'm afraid the doubleton club would keep me from doubling - I think I'd end up being a chicken and passing - maybe bid 1NT?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 21 it was|pg||
nt|davidstern: They may have right sided this to avoid a heart lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: on 25  China in 4@C|pg||

nt|Walddk2: If you go down in 7NT with these cards, you should apply for membership of the VUPW|pg||
nt|h_karluk: :)|pg||
nt|brgpro: if N bids 4@C now, maybe but after 4@d i think the chance they will miss this grand is big|pg||
nt|gracelin: what's that, Rland? U want to apply .|pg||
nt|xenya: PW?|pg||
mb|6D|nt|sybarra: welcome Al |pg||
nt|barnets: i am told its a double round robin|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but since i dont drink coke, is ok|pg||

nt|gracelin: I|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Very Unlucky Players Worldwide|pg||
mb|p|mb|6H|nt|janm: However, pushing the opponents up a level was certainly a good thing, because it looks as if 2@s will be very difficult to make|pg||
nt|fabsayc: partner will only bid clubs with 5, then the support is adequate|pg||
nt|barnets: tks |pg||
nt|barnets: nick|pg||
nt|babs59: I understand that this year it's a double RR and then the leading team wins|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: please wake me up when the high-tower auction ends :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: both East and West are looking at their dangerous club holding to stop at the safe 3S.  Good decision.|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: Your partner, maybe :)|pg||
nt|pelu: 232 VP - 223 - 218|pg||

nt|gracelin: Then I withdraw my application.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We are 28 million members|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|fabsayc: get a new partner jan :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if i had say 2524 i would rebid 2c|pg||
nt|janm: Once upon a time, I doubled 1@d with 4441 (in that order). My partner waited until the 4 level to bid his 4 card club suit!! Taught me :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so i think here double suggests some diamond length|pg||
nt|janm: I would be more likely to DBL with 2524, and certainly with 1534, but I think you're convincing me to bid 1NT|pg||

nt|rnmalik: Except for one 2@S by EW on board 24, all contracts have failed.|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: here the 2-opening-style worked perfect|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Australia (3rd) are about 35 VPs ahead of NZ (6th) here in the Open competition.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: liu had a tough hand, but this is not an attempt to solve it|pg||
nt|tejjyid: IF you take too long to pass here you make it hard for partner to reopen|pg||
nt|tejjyid: plusthe @S Q is unattractive|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: they all love their hands|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: I dont play 3/2 well with no high cards LOL|pg||
nt|cascade: Stout is on the way to 4@s|pg||
nt|janm: 2@h is 5 hearts and a 4+ minor, I guess - I confess I wouldn't have made this one |pg||
nt|janm: Hopefully 3@d showed both diamonds and a minimum|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N would have been 13-15 unless partnership doesn't allow 5422|pg||
nt|babs59: in 2011 the PABF will be held in Macau|pg||
nt|fabsayc: oh, i thought he passed|pg||
nt|brgpro: of course W wont find @h lead i mean|pg||
pc|s7|nt|cascade: 5-4-2-2 equal minimum - you have to have some standards|pg||
nt|henryb:  although 2@s would certainly work out just fine as a contract|pg||
nt|pelu: @c-lead - normal here - dont work - there are 5 @S-tricks|pg||
pc|s2|nt|cascade: that is what is commonly played|pg||
nt|cascade: 3@c/@d = minimums|pg||
nt|janm: Now is 3@s forcing?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not to me|pg||
nt|cascade: and 3@h/@s = maximums with @c/@d respectively|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but then i dont open this crap|pg||
nt|cascade: lets hope not and they have discussed it|pg||
nt|janm: So Miller has shown a minimum, will he decide it's good enough to raise if 3@s isn't forcing?|pg||
nt|cascade: he does have an ace and a fit|pg||
nt|babs59: I have a suspicion that both Zone 6 and Zone 7 will use it for selection purposes for the World Championships|pg||
nt|gracelin: south may not be finished yet.|pg||
nt|brgpro: so he has a good chance of making this|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|sybarra: oops operator |pg||
nt|pelu: now Liu would have prefer to bid 2@s first time - but that risk pass round - do he had to X first|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: he did think|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: sorry a bit sleepy after lunch :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: interesting @s7|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, indeed, so I also bet Fu to make this|pg||
nt|h_karluk: most people prefer 3rd or 4th|pg||
nt|brgpro: 2nd 4th|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  chance for shift|pg||
nt|gracelin: Fu gives East a chance to shift to the damaging Heart|pg||
nt|brgpro: std lead against NT|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|janm: Probably N could have bid 3@s over 2@h to invite in spades, so maybe this should be forcing|pg||
nt|sybarra: I know I do not play their system since that is not a neg X for m |pg||
nt|sybarra: for mi|pg||
nt|rv: Double of 2@c by West is t/o and need not have extras|pg||
nt|pelu: 480|pg||
pc|hK|nt|sybarra: need some coffee or tea |pg||
nt|janm: The 2@h bid did keep EW from getting to too many hearts :)|pg||
nt|cascade: there are lots of ways to bid spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Shirley -- you mean Hou's DBL?|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes I would not X with that hand |pg||
pc|h5|nt|rv: many experts play this treatment below 2M level after 1M-1N-(2X by opps)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: generally, of course, thinking is a good idea|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ambitious X|pg||
nt|jcwla: Seems like W had given full voice to hand already.|pg||
nt|gracelin: Obviously, west cannot double 3S for T/O, which East will pass.|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|sybarra: (or a beer) |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ahollan1: negative dbl with 4+@H -- what's wrong with that?|pg||
nt|rv: double above 2M level on 1M-1N-(2/3X by opps) is still t/o with extras (15+)|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: There are about 8 rounds left; it all finishes on Sunday afternoon (NZ time)|pg||
nt|pzpp: another successful contract is 3NT on board 26, with 3 overtricks:)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: yep-overlooked.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: or rather that was being played at the time of my observation:)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: the problem is @dA on the air|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Second from a bad 4-card suit|pg||
pc|d2|nt|cascade: Lau was undeterred by the hearts sitting over him|pg||
nt|janm: Now, can he make this? Or rather, will he? I'm sure he can double dummy|pg||
nt|jcwla: The one thing they didn't want to do was give up 450 - so instead 500.|pg||
pc|d6|nt|pelu: in OR - where NZ has a very strange system - they never found the @s-suit and they sold out to 5@c - NO X in board 10|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 1@H showed spades i believe|pg||
nt|fabsayc: on board 10 open room|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: that was helpful|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I can understand Hou Xu's double. He thinks the defence has a club ruff on this auction|pg||
nt|jcwla: 1NT over the double would generally show another high card.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They have not, but North has a natural club trick|pg||
nt|Walddk2: heart trick rather|pg||
nt|gracelin: south hoped the defender could cross ruff in the minors, he didn't expect EW bid to 4C on 3-3 fit.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: k|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Would lead fourth with an honour higher than the 10|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer is now home with a later spade finesse|pg||
nt|h_karluk: cover @dK:)|pg||
nt|brgpro: so 11 back...looks like a pinpang game:)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|brgpro: one for you, one for me...|pg||
pc|sA|nt|janm: Or maybe he can't if E puts the diamond K up on a lead towards dummy |pg||
nt|cascade: i think he has to lose at least one trick in each suit|pg||
nt|sybarra: first off, it is only a 7 count,  pard never knows I have 5 hts.  and never knows to bid them |pg||
nt|rv: North should have surely competed to 3@c|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr. As a spec told me 1-4     4-1=28.3%|pg||
pc|s3|nt|fabsayc: the problem was they had no idea whose hand it was|pg||
nt|fabsayc: a common problem when you open very light|pg||
nt|jcwla: One of reasons for 2@C to discourage pd as much as poss'l, give them room to say their peace and be done.|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|friggi: do you agree?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can handle any minor suit rebid from partner too|pg||
nt|h_karluk: oh thanks Wang|pg||
pc|c3|nt|gracelin: but Hengsha leads most of the time.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The Chinese are very good at ping-pong, aka table tennis|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Although it must have been a shock that the women lost in the WC final|pg||
nt|brgpro: they lost to other chinese girls|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i was 2nd at pingong when i was in lycee, and one day i saw a chinese trainer video, that day i quit:) omg it was amazing|pg||
nt|h_karluk: in practice West expected to play low with a poker face|pg||
nt|gracelin: Jack, tell Fu overtricks do not affect imps on this one and claim.|pg||
nt|brgpro: i will text message him!|pg||
nt|brgpro: but he is not on tank, W is!|pg||
nt|gracelin: he can claim 9 tricks if he knows diamonds break.|pg||
pc|c4|nt|janm: Of course N doesn't know he has spade losers, so is just trying to lose a trick in each side suit and ruff the second club loser|pg||
nt|pelu: playing with screens I dont see that there were a "Break Of Tempo)|pg||
pc|c6|nt|brgpro: but @d are rated to break|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|cascade: Chan can Grosvenor now with the @s7|pg||
nt|pelu: EW signals: HL = odd Number|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree with that |pg||
nt|h_karluk: @s or @h?|pg||
nt|brgpro: claim time i think|pg||
nt|gracelin: West took 4 minutes to duck this.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: say shifted a @h then overtake @d A must|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|sybarra: declarer knows well that the club was singleton |pg||
nt|rv: North-South pair not very experienced and probably over-awed by occasion|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Bd 24 very costly to NZ - the dreaded double game swing, when NZ allowed Aus to play in 5C in the other room ..14 IMPs out|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The China table tennis women lost to Singapore represented by Chinese players who have been regarded by the then national team coach as not good enough to play for China. He seemed ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: to have got that wrong :)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|friggi: has to play E for @DK|pg||
nt|alchilds: right pay |pg||
nt|h_karluk: i dont think West draw the big picture, to me auction shouting abt the inferences|pg||
pc|h6|pc|c2|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ahollan1: i'd hate to pass|pg||
nt|Walddk2: @S9 to ask for a diamond return (Lavinthal's suit preference signal)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|Walddk2: But he did not get it|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|tejjyid: with screens, probbaly not|pg||
pc|dT|nt|janm: Now for the bad news|pg||
pc|d5|nt|gracelin: north ignores partner's S9 signal.  Showing no confidence to partner. |pg||
pc|c5|nt|pelu: here the 2@H opening = 6 card suit or good 5 card suit|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|rodal f: If u like % and odds for hook by the %: http://www.bridgehands.com/P/Probability_of_Card_Distribution.htm Bookmark this site.|pg||
pc|d9|nt|sybarra: prefer playing neg free's here, but few folks do....that means under 8/9|pg||
nt|ahollan1: china in trouble again -- on previous hand where 4@H was down 1 --  China in 5@H|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h7|nt|h_karluk: allright, push next board please|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|d7|nt|janm: Those of us who wouldn't have opened 2@h with the S hand can now explain that it would have prevented our side from going down in 4@s|pg||
nt|sybarra: and I will say,  I do not strongly object to the neg X,  with single spade,  and the minor holdings   (just dont like the point count )|pg||
nt|ahollan1: get shape across -- let partner worry about points :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: Newell has 7@H on table as major pen card|pg||
nt|sybarra: ty Amanda|pg||
nt|sybarra: so does that help declarer?  not sure |pg||
pc|h2|pc|h8|nt|ahollan1: does anybody see a 9th trick?|pg||
mc|9|nt|brgpro: but the chinese girls are all teenagers, need some experiences, so losing the would cup is not a bad thing at all|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i do not recommend to watch pairs ping-pong exercise, keep your eyes relaxed :)|pg||

nt|xenya: first imp to Gamax -- of course it would have been wrong to take any finesses on that hand  |pg||
nt|h_karluk: but surprised why not tried onside @h honors|pg||
mb|2N|an|19-21|nt|h_karluk: Gyorgy SZONYI long time no seen in international area, he was a junior in 1986, Budapest|pg||
nt|sundiszno: only 47 more needed|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 3@H ASK stopper for NT|pg||
nt|3for3: Looks like par in the CR|pg||
nt|fabog:  1@D can be any 4333/4432/5332/4441 or 5+ minor unbalanced|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ahollan1: and let black suits take care of themselves :)|pg||
nt|3for3: That doesn't feel like the right bid with that hand, but I understand the upside|pg||
nt|xenya: declarer could have tortured EW by playing out the clubs but decided not to -- well done|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: maybe they have an agreement i shows 7+ solid minor and out|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right Danny -- 2@D just doesn't seem like enough and 5@D too much?|pg||
nt|ritong: why not after all|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: well, you do need more than just a heart stopper|pg||
nt|ritong: if pard is aware, is no big deal|pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: 6@H makeable |pg||
nt|fabog:  1 @S = mild game invitational hand with any distribution|pg||
nt|fabog:  2 @D = 4/5 spades|pg||
nt|h_karluk: slammish|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: when will that book be available ---  The Science of Bidding 8 & 9-card Suits|pg||
nt|ritong: as soon as written  might take some time, though|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i first mentioned it in college -- when i was supposed to be studying a different science|pg||
nt|3for3: are there enough entries to pick up the clubs?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Laszlo HITTMANN last played in 2009 4th EUROPEAN OPEN CHAMPIONSHIPS Sanremo 2009 - Open Pairs - Consolation with our fellow commentator FABOG (Arpad CSATLOS) :)  |pg||
pc|h3|nt|geot: diamond lead take an entry to N early|pg||
nt|3for3: right|pg||
nt|geot: will get problems to bring in the clubs then, you are right.|pg||
nt|3for3: the 8 of clubs lives to stop the slam|pg||
pc|hT|nt|geot: exactly|pg||
nt|3for3: in 6, west might underlead, and south would have to guess to duck it to his Ten!!|pg||
nt|geot: lol.....|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|andreasw:  slam would be down with @s lead and |pg||
nt|h_karluk: how?|pg||
nt|andreasw:  @c 2-5|pg||

nt|h_karluk: draw trumps, pitch @s loser and guess @h well|pg||
nt|andreasw:  offcourse*|pg||
pc|c5|nt|fabog:  2 NT = 0-2 spades, max. 4 hearts|pg||
nt|fabog:  3 @D is passable|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sundiszno: this looks makeable to me...|pg||
nt|xenya: onlty a club lead beats 3N it seems|pg||
nt|fabog:  hard to find the club opening lead with South's hand and this bidding sequence|pg||
nt|xenya: now it is makeable|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Peter BARCZY is much experienced, 90 Neumunster Juniors, 99 Malta open teams, and 2008 Beijing China Open teams|pg||
nt|h_karluk: :)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|xenya: that doesn't mean, however, that it will be made -- in fact, i doubt that  |pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|h4|nt|sundiszno: you'll make 4 diamonds, 2 hearts, one spade for sure|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ahollan1: Asbi forgot the 3@H bid|pg||
nt|ritong: not really|pg||
nt|ritong: he s in 5, cold|pg||

pc|cA|nt|pelu: In B oard 9  EW bid and maded 3NT - @D-lead - decl set up 8 tricks by playing @Ss and in the end S jad problem a discarded a @H from Jxxx with AKQ10 in dummy|pg||

pc|cK|nt|h_karluk: Csaba SZABO also experienced in international field, 98 Vienna School teams, 2000 Antalya Turkiye School teams, 2004 Prague Junior teams, 2005 Riccione Juniors, and 2005 Sydney ...|pg||

nt|tejjyid: I can spel, I just can't type|pg||
nt|Walddk2: How?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Must you not always lose 1 heart, 1 diamond and 2 clubs?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: play a @d to table|pg||
nt|brgpro: NS can make 6@h but i dont think anyone will bid it|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: DBL or 1@h with the N hand?|pg||
nt|barnets: 6-8 weeks from end feb|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the ill bid and fated 3N brings a welcom 7 to Japan|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the north hand on 11 could justify since attempt to deceive, as with a 2nt response|pg||
nt|jcwla: The @S ruff went bye bye - meanwhile 24 a push at 4@SX making.|pg||
mb|1H|nt|janm: I'm a 1@h bidder, but I can see the appeal of DBL|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=ART, STR, F1, (good 13)14+ HCP unbal, 15+ HCP BAL [16+ BAL unfav]|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: yes there are screens and was not a long think|pg||
nt|jcwla: 31 straight for the leaders.|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sybarra: its the nebulous 1 @D in the precision system |pg||
nt|cascade: me too|pg||
nt|barnets: sorry|pg||
nt|babs59: np :)|pg||
nt|rv: some form of Bergen raise by Peter here?|pg||
nt|babs59: yes|pg||
nt|npcjpn: pass, double or 2@c?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: agree-@D lead difficult but not impossible.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 26 hc, rare but elegant @h slam|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: P=0-9 or less than 3 controls|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 2@c+1@d, oh sorry, North's @h J9xx|pg||
nt|gracelin: so the 800 in other room are not a real disaster.|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|janm: I'd think Miller would want to bid 2@h to keep West from an easy 2@d bid; wonder why it took him so long?|pg||
nt|henryb:  5@d is certainly a reasonable contract: needs no @d loser or the club finesse and decent breaks|pg||
nt|babs59: Peter's bidding is very straight forward.  I managed to play a tournament with him last year - our first game together in more than 30 years!|pg||
nt|pelu: here a better overcall against 1@c - and in green|pg||
nt|h_karluk: btw QJ doubleton @d:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: i would x as south|pg||
nt|rv: I would have Xed from South hand|pg||
nt|babs59: we would all have doubled as South|pg||
nt|kaz08833: EW can make 4@h here but can they bid it?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: pass for me or 2c|pg||
nt|rodal f: But by 21NS = 19EW and open from EW.......|pg||
nt|pzpp: 2@d must be waiting, with 2@h as double negative|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  this overcall may help NS |pg||
mb|3S|nt|h_karluk: passed hand 2N?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|friggi: 11-14|pg||
nt|alchilds: low =1|pg||
nt|sybarra: will be scramble but should be able to find 7 tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: playing clubs from the top |pg||
nt|friggi: yes low and play @C for 2-3|pg||
nt|sybarra: sometimes you just have to hope for the best|pg||
nt|friggi: if dec do so % is very much in his favour|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  but their best result is to double 4@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: Lui hesitated|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: Liu|pg||
nt|gracelin: in closed room West opened 2D to show both major, and East bid to the no-chance 4S game.|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwi_joker: 2H might be hearts and a minor, 3H now showing a "good" weak hand with hearts and clubs|pg||
nt|pzpp: now, 3@d transfers to @h, wrong place to play the @h contract for more than 11 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: deep think|pg||
nt|tejjyid: time for another coffee|pg||
nt|brgpro: i dont like X...why not 2@c? pd can bid any 2 level suit easily and, can support @C if ness.|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: 5@d is an awfully big bid! I know he has a stiff heart, but surely his partner knows it too, since he's heard the opponents bidding|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Jeff may duck a round of spades here|pg||
nt|rodal f: Should be a easy play.|pg||
nt|pelu: small @c will defeat|pg||
nt|rnmalik: oops-wrong sided.|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  2nt with fit|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 2@s would be my bid|pg||
nt|gracelin: 2NT is a good 4-card raise.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: cue promises goodish|pg||
pc|sT|nt|fabsayc: 9 tricks|pg||
nt|fabsayc: with winning heart guess|pg||
nt|pelu: the the winning lead - for declarer :(|pg||
nt|pelu: I am glad I dont have do bid 1NT on the East hand - a naturel (F!) 2@c|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer is bound to lose 3 more clubs here for the same -1 |pg||
nt|jcwla: Here a fun part of Precision - 4@S could be on wide variety of hands.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The club switch seems pretty obvious, but Hou does not even have to switch. The contract has no chance as Patrick pointed out|pg||
nt|brgpro: -3 imps anyway|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ahollan1: was just going to say  not sure if Puppet :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so picked passive defense|pg||
pc|sK|nt|janm: And even though 2@c was in competition, it should show something, shouldn't it?|pg||
nt|cascade: considering he already stretched to 2@c|pg||
nt|ahollan1: operator alerted for me!!!|pg||
nt|barnets: and all gone minus in 4@C|pg||
nt|rv: inexperience/fatigue showing in Macau's game, it happens to all if you are playing long matches and superior opposition for the first time|pg||
nt|barnets: but thats not the point|pg||
nt|babs59: I feel more like Peng is remembering his 800 - which should have been put aside the moment it happened|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Thanks Amanda!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so no winning defense, both games depend on hearts|pg||
nt|pelu: but even on a small @C decl can have 9 tricks finding @HQ = 8 in Major|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, the safe route.  If south decided to switch to club, I thk he would have picked CJ.|pg||
nt|brgpro: 6 @h is not that bad contract after @s lead...|pg||
pc|sA|nt|vugraphzkt: np ... 1st time I knew what they were doing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @H9 might have been Rusinow -- promising @H10|pg||
nt|ahollan1: either way -- my $$$ on defense|pg||
nt|jcwla: No big deal here but sometimes the opps will have a quandary with a borderline hand -- you could be stealing, or have every bit of it and punish them if they go for it.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I always seem to get this wrong, which of the player names is the family name, Patrick?|pg||
nt|gracelin: Meckwell call it mixed strategy, you could bid 1S  4S with either Qxxxx  x  J10xxx  xx  or Q10x  Kxxx  AJx  Kxx.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|pelu: bad luck for W - but with @Ds 2-2 or 3-1 4@S X = 500-800|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think he thought about ducking might have been best |pg||
nt|ahollan1: @C will be very successful choice here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @CAce that is|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and actually -- then there are 9|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no @H duck because didn't want @S shift|pg||
nt|sybarra: well its the 5/3 suit |pg||
nt|tejjyid: some reason to downgade (singleton @H) - IMO offset by good intermediates|pg||
pc|s5|nt|kiwi_joker: LOL ..and gets a reward with his 8 scoring!|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: oops|pg||
nt|pzpp: 5@h must deny control in @d, with which West will have a convenient cuebid|pg||

pc|h2|pg||
nt|rv: Macau is doing reasonably well, 8th place |pg||

pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: bravo|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|kaz08833: to make 4@h E must play @s now but playing 3@h trump is reasonable|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|brgpro: needs 3-2 trumps and 4-2 @C only|pg||
pc|s4|nt|vugraphzkt: think|pg||
pc|h8|nt|janm: Surely not? after the 2@h bid|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 5@D would have been a lot better opposite at least one club|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the winning heart play is both correct initially and on the bidding|pg||
pc|hA|nt|kiwibridge: Liu's 2@H was an underbid|pg||
nt|h_karluk: yes Patrick, really 3 Li surname at the table|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h4|pc|h3|pg||
nt|fabsayc: since it handles a 4-1 break|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|nt|kiwi_joker: If he's got 'count' in clubs from Tony, Sartaj should know to take this trick|pg||

nt|jcwla: CR has finished up so welcome to those joining us from there.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Which is number one in China, Li perhaps? :)|pg||

nt|vugraphzkt: it did|pg||
nt|janm: How?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: to say Newell-Reid have had a good set is quite an underbid|pg||
nt|kaz08833: dbl then 2@s or 3@h shows E's hand precisely|pg||
nt|fabsayc: however declarer should have made an overtrick|pg||
nt|fabsayc: oh he did so low club saves the overtrick|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: that was lucky|pg||
nt|rnmalik: very lucky indeed.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Li is the 4th. Zhao the number 1 I am told|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: possible if defense never lead trumps|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Or is it Wang?|pg||
nt|brgpro: this looks an easy 6@d for ew, esp. for precision players|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|alchilds: yes|pg||
nt|friggi: 2@S pass out|pg||
nt|cascade: the play showed declarer leading trumps|pg||
nt|pelu: in Board 8: taipei in 7@h - and lost @DQ - West had also open only 1@S - with a 4@S-opening more easy to find @DQ - but diff to bid 7 :)|pg||
nt|rv: traditionally Chinese Taipei and Indonesia were top teams in Zone 6, now it is very competitive with China, Japan etc making rapid strides in world bridge|pg||
nt|gracelin: Kebiya can still win the match if Hengsha fails to reach 6D here. |pg||
mb|p|nt|friggi: risky|pg||
nt|jcwla: That @ST would keep Lord Yarborough from having to pay off 1000-1.|pg||
nt|gracelin: No, Roland, the rank you mentioned is just a book of 100 names in which the order is listed.  Started with Zhao followed by Chien, Sun and Li.  Nothing to do with their popuarity.|pg||
nt|brgpro: well....after the favorite 2@h......|pg||

nt|h_karluk: Q tripleton clubs and three little diamonds brothers, also opening leader|pg||
mb|2N|an| |nt|ahollan1: 1@D=ART, 9-13 HCP, 4+@H, maybe longer @C/@D/@S|pg||
nt|rv: China is arguably the strongest team in whole of Asia (Zone 4-BFAME, 6-Far East) now|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: This is a real blind spot by Jeff... he should just have continued @Ds ..after that good fortune in the spade suit, he had 5@Ds, 3@Ss and a club for a certain 9|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: 2 tricks in the play and 7 back to CT on 23|pg||

nt|barnets: multi 21D|pg||
nt|rv: some play lebensohl from North hand on 2@h by West|pg||
nt|barnets: south better not pass|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and we see them, 2@H a constructive spade raise|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: good pre-empt !|pg||

mb|p|nt|sybarra: and not wasted values here |pg||
nt|sybarra: well maybe the q of @D's|pg||
nt|friggi: right, freindly layout and lead as well|pg||
nt|cascade: a subdued Miller and Stout here should win back some IMPs|pg||
nt|jcwla: Finally, some pressure from N/S.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: however normal lead is @sK|pg||
nt|brgpro: 2nd hand 2@h shd be more discriptive, that is: it shd be 55, esp. vul.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|janm: Yes, surely he'll make at least 3 :)|pg||
nt|cascade: or rather too much aggression at the other table to wind up to 5@c|pg||
nt|sybarra: and we may play it here also |pg||
nt|Walddk2: If you count China only, Wang is number 1 several specs tell me|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: now 4@H|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well maybe, could simply be a cue raise also|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: he should expect a @s bid after a X|pg||
nt|gracelin: Wang must have out ranked Chang in recent years.|pg||
mb|p|nt|friggi: friendly|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh well forget that statement|pg||
nt|kaz08833: i guess the score is almost tie because Japan will gain another 8 on bd 25|pg||
nt|rodal f: Same bidding so fare|pg||
nt|pzpp: seems that NS plays negative free bid|pg||
nt|tejjyid: @D Q now, for fun|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: I like 4@H - 5@S|pg||
nt|pelu: best defense against 2@S is to lead @S4 - but in CR East - absolut normal - played @S A K 4 ( and stole his pds @SQ)|pg||
nt|gracelin: Jack, every team will win some prize money np matter the position they finish. So will you be entitled to share these prizes even if your name is not in te team ?  |pg||
pc|sK|nt|henryb:  6@s looks like a much better contract|pg||
nt|barnets: 6@S|pg||
nt|npcjpn: on this hand, NS can make 3NT, but no way to reach..|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3@D was different|pg||
nt|brgpro: i dont want to take their earnings...i could go but i didnt:)|pg||
nt|xenya: blame system here?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: 3@H confirming 5@H along the way to showing max 1N|pg||
nt|rv: yes good auction|pg||
nt|rv: is Peng's 4N quant here?|pg||
pc|s6|nt|sybarra: hopefully no one leads trumps too soon |pg||
nt|janm: I think a 3@c rebid with the N hand was what pushed them too high - it just has too much in the short suits and too many quacks|pg||
nt|babs59: the other table started with North bidding 2@H - both majors, weak|pg||
nt|pelu: almost for first time EW stepped wrong - down 200/300|pg||
nt|tejjyid: the old surround play|pg||
nt|brgpro: no, but the definition of the convention shd be discussed more...|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in college we defined  Down 1 = Good Bridge|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yes -- i was enrolled in college   no - i didn't go to class as often as i went to bridge table|pg||
nt|sybarra: LOL  |pg||
nt|sybarra: but we made it thru right?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: after a mere 16 years|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but i made LM in decent time|pg||
nt|jcwla: Meanwhile, Chinese Taipei has cut the deficit by 10 by getting to the @D game on 26 - also making 7.|pg||
nt|gracelin: That's a pity, Jack.  Kebiya is due to win US$150 from this match :)|pg||
nt|brgpro: E shd never open 2@h in this position|pg||
pc|d2|nt|rodal f: Normaly trumh would been the best lead, but E want W to lead that color.|pg||
pc|d5|nt|rnmalik: sorry-some connection.|pg||
pc|dK|nt|sybarra: some of us "dashed" thru faster than that,  but my father who often was nice enough to pick my up from school always knew where to find me |pg||
nt|rv: I suspect not though it could be for many other partnerships since fit is not found|pg||
nt|barnets: ok well done|pg||
nt|rv: as Barnet suggested, Peng should bid 4@h to show good @s fit, mild slam try|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|rv: and his direct 4n should possibly be quant?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|barnets: try and give a ruff|pg||
pc|h3|nt|barnets: looking at dummys diamonds|pg||
pc|h7|nt|henryb:  @h by E-W should work out well, but you had better correct that|pg||

nt|pelu: Yes as Martin say: @DQ is not unly fun - Its the way to pick up @Dj in S|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|pelu: Lead @DK to A and now @HA made the play easy|pg||
nt|henryb:  he may go down now|pg||
nt|gracelin: another pick-up for Xinyuan. But they also have a bad board waiting for them on board  14.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Meanwhile, back at the ranch Xinyuan will add to their load of IMPs here|pg||
pc|d6|nt|tejjyid: would have been better with the @D 9 tho|pg||
pc|d8|nt|sybarra: (student union bridge and euche room)|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I think only 8tricks - 2D, 2@H & a @S|pg||
nt|tejjyid: the srround play looks good, but it eneded up simplifying the hand for declarer|pg||
pc|d9|nt|henryb:  a lot, in fact|pg||
nt|pelu: need to finess in @s to make|pg||
nt|rodal f: Just follow the highway to the doubblescore|pg||

nt|barnets: after the wk two bid|pg||
nt|davidstern: Strange declarer is pitching diamonds which can be ruffed rather than clubs|pg||
nt|rodal f: Last board is up and last for me to.|pg||
nt|rodal f: THX spec. Was nice.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: last one all|pg||
nt|jcwla: Another good result for Indonesia here.|pg||
nt|jcwla: All those who said @HT would win last trick may pick up their prizes.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: oops, i dont believe CR was in slam|pg||
nt|gracelin: they are all slam-lovers|pg||
nt|brgpro: 2nd hand u shd be more careful, because the chance to pre-e pd has increeased to 50/50|pg||
nt|h_karluk: lots IMPs|pg||
nt|h_karluk: such as 12|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: And what would you do with this one? Pass and hope to bid later? Open 1, or open a bunch?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: China on the board!|pg||
nt|sybarra: and our last bd of this set |pg||
nt|barnets: they like the multi|pg||
nt|barnets: so do I|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: last board to the match now, thanks very much to Nobuyuki and Kaz for their great comments, thz Amanda on the vugraph, great job, and thx all specs for your feedback|pg||
nt|npcjpn: thanks all.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: join us agin tomorrow|pg||
nt|kaz08833: thanks all too|pg||
nt|davidstern: 3NT N/S here|pg||
nt|rodal f: Thx to the exelent vug operator. Well done:)|pg||
nt|pelu: last board - 25 VP for Taipie|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: thx to out wonderful operator,   great job as always |pg||
nt|alchilds: easy|pg||
nt|sybarra: and thx to Friggi, and Al,  and Frank and Pat, who were here earlier |pg||
nt|friggi: thx all|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: thank you. back in  a bit oveer 30 minutes- lets hope I am more awake then :)|pg||
nt|davidstern: But no easy road to get there|pg||
nt|gracelin: but East's 6D may succeed if south didn't lead a Heart.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: however in practice hard to defend|pg||
nt|h_karluk: now game is hot, 41-38 and last 3 boards|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  this board doesn't look like swing|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|sybarra: and of course great thx to our specs, for the helpful (and sometimes humorous comments |pg||
nt|janm: Lau chose the latter course (when I'm playing that 4 of a minor is natural, I love to be able to open it)|pg||
nt|davidstern: North will make a move and South has a max perhaps they will find it|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the real problem was a substandard neg double|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 3H nice warning|pg||
nt|gracelin: Precision 1C opening is vulnerable to high level preemptive, like here.|pg||
nt|brgpro: esp. when vul, u shd definitely have 55 i.e. ( u dont want to accept other suits)|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  another ambitious 3N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: remaining matches for the day are posted now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: next will be Open: Australia v China Macau   Senior: Indonesia v New Zealand (Cornell)|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|janm: In the other room, East also opened 4@c but his partner judged to raise |pg||
nt|kaz08833: this one shd be push|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Thanks K1W1 great job.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: 2 matches tomorrow|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: thx :)|pg||
nt|pzpp: 2 matches tomorrow? I think that they have 3 left|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: thought there were only 2 could be wrong|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that may cost to 8 IMPs|pg||
mb|1H|nt|fabsayc: ah, the hand that needs the heart shift|pg||
nt|cascade: an interesting point is that I think that dealing programs need to have published their algorithms to allay suspicion|pg||
nt|ahollan1: guessing 2@C = weak @C + another|pg||
nt|davidstern: There you go|pg||
mb|d|nt|henryb:  on 24HC with no particular source of tricks|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: still a few boards to be played and scored in the open room|pg||
nt|davidstern: So this should be 7 imps to Indonesia assuming 0-1-4-5|pg||
nt|davidstern: For ten tricks|pg||
nt|rodal f: A sac at 5@C but 5@H also on|pg||
nt|gracelin: Jack obviously prefer a disciplined 2nd hand preemptive, especially at Vul. which an old man like me surely agree. |pg||
mb|3H|nt|fabsayc: overtake and heart seems right|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: i am booked to do 2 :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: incredible ap|pg||
nt|gracelin: I don't particularly like the 4H raise at this Vul.|pg||
mb|4S|nt|friggi: my guess was 3@C 3NT|pg||
nt|sybarra: quick shot of something then for you....(what ever that is) |pg||
nt|jcwla: 5 to Indonesia on 27 when Liu failed to lead A and a @S at T2 against 5@DX.|pg||
mb|p|nt|alchilds: my too may go set|pg||
nt|janm: Yes, and maybe the spade 10 should suggest shifting to a heart?|pg||
nt|pelu: again the 1NT 6-12 created the problem|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Reid -- 1st DBL = PEN  2nd DBL = Takeout [i think]|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Dont understand, if cant x 3@C bid 3@S:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: this event is really too long, we have to realize how long everybody has already been playing|pg||
nt|h_karluk: oops 3@h, 4@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: Guess not|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think any spade but ace is really wrong|pg||
nt|janm: Of course, they're not going to beat 4 whatever they do|pg||
nt|rodal f: Did Caledonia steel candy from the opps?:)|pg||
nt|jcwla: Me or your lying eyes?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: last board and some laughter here|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  oops|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and no double no trouble|pg||
pc|s5|nt|friggi: needs @H play from Dec, diff to find|pg||
nt|sybarra: my guess is will play @D up from hand |pg||
nt|friggi: agree|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N was 13-15|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @S shift is killer|pg||
nt|sybarra: can China make a profit here?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  E is near to make it|pg||
nt|gracelin: no trouble even with doubvle this time.|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|henryb:  this one needs 3@c tricks, a reasonable shot, and either 4@h and 2@s or lots of spade tricks|pg||
nt|pelu: in normal system u would pass 2@S|pg||
nt|rv: this should make 9 tricks even with likley @s finesse|pg||
pc|s3|nt|pelu: best lead|pg||
nt|henryb:  My stomach is growling, so I will leave you. Have fun, and thanks, Peter|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: long explanations|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: haha sorry |pg||
nt|h_karluk: almost|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|rv: we are playing last board of this match|pg||
nt|gracelin: I see 10 tricks, no ?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i like this game|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  beleiving @s are 3-3 and @c K is well placed|pg||
pc|dA|nt|pelu: see u again - here it is bedtime almost 2 O'clock in night|pg||
pc|d2|nt|cascade: For those kibitzers who are interested in chess|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ahollan1: absolutely -- i was thinking best defense 300|pg||
nt|rodal f: 22-19 after this board. Then OR left to change the result|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This tournament is sponsored by Mr Xin Yuan, played at the newest and best bridge club in Beijing, Xin Yuan Bridge Club|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|rv: my thanks to excellent Vu graph operator and wonderful co-commentators Barnet Shenkin and Barbara Travis|pg||
nt|babs59: and thank you RV and Barnet, for not jinxing Australia too much|pg||
pc|dK|nt|fabsayc: no so maybe here a bit more excusable|pg||
nt|barnets: well tks all specs and fellow commentators I am retiring for the night |pg||
pc|dT|nt|cascade: Ker at the other table is a many time NZ Chess champion|pg||
nt|fabsayc: imagine playing a football match or basketball game every day for two weeks|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: agree|pg||
nt|h_karluk: likely +420|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: a complete round robin, every match you win there is 1000 yuan, ( 500 each if draw), and top 6 teams will have other money prize|pg||
nt|brgpro: W has bid too much, but justice isn't done here|pg||
nt|gracelin: when you have CQ in dummy, you don't really need CK to be on side :)|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s8|nt|rv: also a word of appreciation to Roland Wald who organises all these Vu graph broadcats and BBO management for telecasting it live|pg||
nt|rv: finally to all specs for listening to us patiently|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s4|pg||
nt|cascade: about 8 or 9 times i have lost count|pg||
nt|jcwla: Thanks to our excellent operator, PABF, NBZ, all specs - it's been fun.|pg||
nt|jcwla: For now, from Los Angeles, so long.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: thx :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: good match|pg||
nt|jcwla: NZB even.|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ahollan1: maybe 500 now|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: E could have got a ruff|pg||
nt|rnmalik: By play small @S-guts:)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: playing|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: no after Q@d|pg||
nt|pzpp: the double of 2NT normally shows interest in penalty on at least one of the minors contract, since he does not want to double 3@c, 3@s sounds much more reasonable than pass|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: they are all packing up here instead of playing|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: now E thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: motionless|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1000 yuan is about US$150|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sA|pc|s7|pg||
nt|janm: Interesting how many people are good at both games|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  indeed :-)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: in the masters club i doubt that 4@s would attract the most votes|pg||
mc|10|nt|fabsayc: there is a dealing program written by a norwegian|pg||
nt|fabsayc: which produces a lot of wild hands|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this looks like that program|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it is used by some of the dealing equipment|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so wherever the equipment goes|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and i am totally convinced the hands are not random|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the technical term is pseudo random|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but in a run of say a million hands it should converge on the theoretical odds |pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: romm will stay open unti scores are finalised|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @H10 would have been very trusting - an maybe worthy of write-up|pg||
nt|sybarra: interesting position now however |pg||
nt|ahollan1: @D best|pg||
nt|rv: this is last round for the day, please join us tomorrow for more exciting matches in RR2|pg||
nt|Walddk4: One more round today|pg||
nt|Walddk4: In 40 minutes|pg||
nt|rv: sorry 1 more round today in 40 mins, thanks all|pg||
nt|babs59: what treat is in store?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Chinese Taipei vs Japan  open |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Can't remember the other one|pg||
nt|babs59: Under 26 Australia v Japan|pg||
nt|Walddk4: One from the U21 I think|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Oh, thx|pg||
nt|babs59: and Open  Chinese Taipei v Japan|pg||
nt|babs59: U21 is what I WANT Roland :)|pg||
nt|babs59: specifically Australia U21 :)|pg||
nt|babs59: of course, I know that that will happen when I have to work!!|pg||
nt|rv: Aus win this match 25-5 if this score stands|pg||
nt|rv: bye all|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: scores correct closing the room now |pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: next match begins in 30minutes |pg||

nt|h_karluk: x-2 wld save 6 IMPs|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i don't believe that 8 cards @h fit couldn't revealed|pg||
nt|Walddk4: This is a hand where a prediction is very tough. Best would be for EW to stop in 3@C for example|pg||
nt|h_karluk: http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/ daf/i-p-c-s.org/faq/curse.php  The "Curse of Scotland"|pg||
nt|andreasw:  this board is interesting|pg||
nt|andreasw:  on 3@c N-S will problebly bid 3@d |pg||
nt|sundiszno: a short technical break here|pg||
nt|pelu: 1@H -pas - pas 1@s or 2@s?|pg||

nt|Walddk4: http://online.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php|pg||
nt|h_karluk: omg today June 08, 2010. lol, my apolgies to all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: May I suggest that you bookmark that site where all times are local to *you*. That will save me from lots of questions about where, when and what. Thank you|pg||
nt|vugraphzmz: about 2 minutes|pg||
nt|Walddk4: We will be broadcasting from 6 or 8 tables in every session (32 altogether)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  thx|pg||
nt|Walddk4: For a start, we have all of Italy's matches in the open series|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that's a very nice suggestion, please also note http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph_archives/vugraph_archives.php?command=all  and http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/ |pg||
mb|p|nt|fabog:  2 @C = majors under opening strength|pg||
nt|h_karluk: nice toy when both nonvul|pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: Nice slam in hearts here.|pg||
mb|1N|an|14-16|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sundiszno: small @c lead?|pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: Perfect fit with with xxx opposite singelton diamond|pg||
nt|sundiszno: too small :)|pg||
pc|h7|nt|andreasw:  3@d|pg||
pc|h4|nt|pelu: new suit from a non-passed hand sh be F1|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: 2@S=ART STR Raise;|pg||
nt|h_karluk: however X could save the day, N obviously would find a chance to bid 2@d in case allowed|pg||
nt|xenya: doesn't help -- 8 top tricks|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|h3|nt|geot: If 3@D showed shortage they are on their way to slam|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hJ|nt|andreasw:  now this must be the final bid|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we can only guess what Asbi's bids are - but I'm with Geo that 3@D probably like Jacoby 2N response showing shortness|pg||
pc|hK|pc|d3|nt|andreasw:  S should have bid 2nt on 2@s?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: true, new suit nonpassed hand F1 yet not quashing in Modern Bridge|pg||
nt|pelu: so the pass from S just pushed NS on the 4-level|pg||
pc|h2|nt|h_karluk: ?|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|h8|nt|geot: Well bid, whatever the bids meant:)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: what's going on there pls?|pg||
nt|andreasw:  should win|pg||
nt|pelu: how|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ahollan1: indeed|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|geot: Nothing to the play here...as long trumps are not 4-0. Soon claiming, I suspect|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Hung-Edgtton in 6@H for Australia U26|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|hT|nt|andreasw:  east will be the only one to come in here so u just need to ruff 3@c|pg||
pc|c8|pc|s3|pc|d5|pg||
pc|d7|nt|andreasw:  and with only 1@d should win|pg||
nt|andreasw:  now will for sure win|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|d6|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|h_karluk: say pulled trumps, then where will you park 3 heart losers?|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|nt|h_karluk: why West didn't set 2N while he was in with @sJ|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|c5|nt|h_karluk: @c A was highly helpful|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cJ|pc|d9|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and S didn't need to hook @s|pg||
pc|s2|nt|andreasw:  sry u need to ruff a @h aswell |pg||

nt|h_karluk: interesting another Xin Yuan is in USA, Department of Computer Science , Florida State University|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  but see th score|pg||
nt|h_karluk: however nicely done|pg||
nt|h_karluk: keener competition, as i said : "the table is hot" :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|xenya: nice save in the CR|pg||
mb|d|nt|xenya: or not?|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|gracelin: looks like a push here and Xinyuan is safe for their US$150.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think you can beat 4@S|pg||
mb|2S|nt|xenya: yes|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i expect 4@s, anyways why not 5@d try|pg||
nt|gracelin: 3 rounds of Hearts may beat 4S, So 5D is a phantom.|pg||
mb|4H|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: guys, we all know table pressure. last 2 boards|pg||
pc|hA|nt|gracelin: Xinyuan and Sanchen are sister clubs.  Xinyuan often enter domestic tournament under the name of Sanchen.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am told that all 10 teams are guaranteed some kind of money prize no matter where they finish|pg||
nt|jcwla: My kind of tournament.|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, from RMB12,000 for ethe winner to RMB1,000 for 9th/10th.  Total prize money is RMB 100,000.|pg||

pc|d2|pc|hT|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hmm, i may be wrong, either 2008 or 2009 i remember the Sanchen Cup on BBO Vugraph|pg||
nt|gracelin: Will West shift to his singleton club after 2-round of H?  He shouldn't do that.|pg||
nt|brgpro: he will play a @h|pg||
nt|gracelin: East shud give a signal asking for spade continuation rather than club shift.|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  I suppose, E should convinc partner to continue @h, but how?|pg||
pc|h7|pc|sQ|pc|d3|pc|h9|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 35 mins rather|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 15 minutes to the hour|pg||
pc|sA|nt|brgpro: looking at the A in dummy he wont do that...but the problem is the X on 1@h|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|h_karluk: it's not hard to find a route to 4@s, the defense cannot lead the trumps|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|pg||
pc|s2|pc|d4|nt|gracelin: according to the schedule, there is only a 5-minute break after each match.  But these players play fast and will normally finish earlier|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Must be wrong to switch to a club. If partner has a club trick, it won't disappear, and Cheng Zhe realised that|pg||
nt|gracelin: Cheng can see no hurry for a club shift.|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Thanks to our operator in Beijing, and to our commentators, Patrick, Jack, Sveta, Hamdi and Vladimir|pg||
nt|gracelin: Kebiya will lose this match even if their NS bid and make 3NT here.  it's non-Vul. and only 6 imps.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and to the CCBA (Song Zao) for allowing us to broadcast|pg||
nt|h_karluk: anytime sir, tx fellows|pg||
nt|brgpro: assume u X on 1@h then 3@h comes back to u, u will see urself in a very difficult position|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: we are indebted to Mr Bionic Man, also Patrick and Jordan|pg||
nt|gracelin: indeed.  Kokish will bid 1S even with another Ace in hand.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Last match today in 30 minutes and a wee bit; top of the hour. Welcome back|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: please stay with us, today's Vugraph is really wonderful|pg||
nt|brgpro: they play 14-16 NT, so will open 1@d|pg||
mb|1N|nt|gracelin: but if Sanchen can get another imps, it will  become 19:11, so the overtrick here counts.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Last board of the match now. Many thanks to our hard working (anonymous) operator in Beijing. Well done!|pg||
nt|brgpro: S will never go beyond 1NT|pg||
nt|xenya: so S will never raise|pg||
nt|gracelin: south will pass with north limited to 13 HCP|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: agreed|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And to our excellent commentators, Patrick, Hamdi and Jordan|pg||

pc|hA|pg||
pc|h7|nt|gracelin: declarer has a chance to make this to reduce its deficit. a Good D guess is essential.|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Thanks all, back in half an hour with a match from round 3|pg||
pc|c5|nt|gracelin: East was about to pass 2S until north bid 3H.  Even in balancing position I would not dream of bidding 3H with this north hand.|pg||
pc|d3|pc|c9|pc|c2|pg||
