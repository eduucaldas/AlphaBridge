nt|henryb:  Hello All|pg||
nt|henryb:  back to 17|pg||
nt|gracelin: Hi all|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Hi|pg||
nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|gracelin: Hi Roland.  The first match saw one 20:10 . three 17:13 and one 16:14VP.  Hengsha now leads the field by wnning 20 in their first match against China's Ladies team.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: this may be first ones to one nt |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=ART, 9-13 HCP, 4+@H, maybe longer @C/@D/@S|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome to Al Hollander|pg||
mb|1D|nt|sybarra: another set with the "fun" systems|pg||
nt|ahollan1: expect a LOT of alerts for NS system   Forcing 1@C, Transfer Openers [aka submarine]|pg||
nt|henryb:  Hello All|pg||
nt|henryb:  A partscore battle, with N-S aboe to make 4@c and E-W 2@s|pg||
nt|tejjyid: And this time, it's also probbaly the battle for 2ndplace as well|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hi all.|pg||
mb|d|nt|henryb:  I would expect the auction to start P-P-1@s-some bid showing @h& a minor |pg||
nt|henryb:  wrond again|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=NF, ART, 8-11 HCP, 3@H  [maybe min, 4@H]|pg||
nt|sybarra: al,  are e/w playing precision? |pg||
nt|ahollan1: Shi-Hou are playing Precision -- i was just typing that Shirley :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: for those watching,  this will be a lot of artificial bidding,  |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hi everyone welcome|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: hi|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: both pairs at other table also playing Precision variant|pg||
nt|sybarra: only used with experienced partnerships and 400 pages of system notes|pg||
nt|henryb:  The Australian pair clearly do not play strong club|pg||
nt|rodal f: N for the first take out.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Jack, please tell us about these two teams|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think NS plays 1M>2M direct raise 8-10|pg||
mb|2S|nt|sybarra: ok maybe only 385 pages|pg||
nt|ahollan1: convention cards -- and some supplementary notes - online under http://www.pabf2010.co.nz/Participants/Convention-Cards/Open.aspx|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi all:)|pg||
nt|brgpro: kebiya=copia, my club|pg||
mb|3D|nt|gracelin: and north is the boss, Mr. Jin|pg||
nt|brgpro: my pd is playing with my boss|pg||
nt|gracelin: not a good sign, Jack.|pg||
nt|brgpro: :)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|sybarra: might N sit?|pg||
nt|sybarra: or is he bidding  1 nt |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: this seems rather high|pg||
nt|rodal f: Teyssier was cold:)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Hi to the kibitzers!|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: must say I am not a fan of sitting at imps|pg||
nt|jcwla: D/K if this is the dummy N is expecting, but it's not enough.  This is down a couple.|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  clearly 1N was forcing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Reid's 2@D bid doesn't seem to fit the explanation I gave -- but i got if from their notes |pg||
nt|gracelin: This is the first match of an invitational event of Beijing's 10 bridge clubs. |pg||
nt|Walddk2: While Jack will be watching the Football World Cup I presume :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  hello to all|pg||
nt|brolucius: East's 2@S is non-forcing but suggests around 8-10 points, to distinguish it from a 1@S response on around 0-7.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: If this is a typical hand for mini-splinter, west should be able to stop safely despite his wealth of high cards|pg||
pc|dA|nt|vugraphzkt: good morning all|pg||
pc|d9|nt|rv: Hi all, gm from sunny bangalore in South India|pg||
nt|rodal f: The web page for the turney: http://www.pabf2010.co.nz/|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Good morning|pg||
nt|h_karluk: decent controls|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3@D was somewhat forward on those values, but South would no doubt have opened 1@D on a doubleton and wanted to tell North that she could compete with a diamond fit.|pg||
pc|d5|nt|rv: Hi Rodal|pg||
nt|gracelin: the 10 teams will play a 16-bds round robin to decide winners.  Cash prizes for all teams plus for wnners of every match. |pg||
nt|brgpro: all other team members are in beijing|pg||
nt|gracelin: and NBA final about 3 hours ago.|pg||
nt|brgpro: i prefer to stay at home...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Sun Ming is a one of the top woman players in China |pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|janm: EW will probably end in 4@s on this one, and should make it unless NS get 2 club ruffs - I guess 5@c is actually better, let's see if West will show his club support to get there|pg||
nt|janm: This auction might get them to 3NT, which would not be a success|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the Open Room starts play with board  29 -- so they will see results from us|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure who do bet on here,  defense if @H start I think|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and potentially valuable @dK|pg||
pc|d6|nt|henryb:  the two-step probably shows constructive values|pg||
nt|gracelin: EW in both rooms reached the inferior 4-3 fit rather than the 5-3 D fit.|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mwigor: hi all|pg||
nt|barnets: looks like a save v 5@H|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ahollan1: we can only peek at their [and any other vugraph table] using http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/ |pg||
nt|gracelin: the two teams playing here are the host Xinyuan and their sister club Sanchen Cartoon|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|henryb:  We do not have an auction, but at the other table West over reached to 4@s and caught a vey bad dummy|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Hyper-agressive bidding by the NZ  north-south in the other room propelled the auction very high, very quick|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 6@d in the 4-3 fit looks OK to me|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 6NT you can make with the right guesses as well|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: big think by Tony|pg||
nt|brgpro: N is the famous chinese lady player, S used to be the coach of the chinese junior's team|pg||
nt|brgpro: EW are fairly young players|pg||
nt|brgpro: maybe not that young...born in the 70's|pg||
nt|brolucius: What 'fairly young' means depends on your own age.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: East should not drive to slam as passed hand, lack of key card situation|pg||
nt|brolucius: 8-10 opposite 14 does not really place them in the slam range.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|janm: Perhaps if W bid 3@c here, E might retreat to 5@c, but West decided his suit was good enough to play in, and with the @h A lead, he'll be right, I think|pg||
nt|pelu: Hi all|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: this match is 1st China-Taipei vs 5th Japan|pg||
nt|h_karluk: it would be a fall from grace, routine +450|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h7|nt|tejjyid: The auction looks a bit murky, Nunn calrifies it for us|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: ..and in the end they got the outcome they wanted (opps made the last mistake!)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: a passive @S lead & East will be very happy|pg||
pc|h2|nt|tejjyid: Thanks for coming...|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hT|pc|h3|pg||
nt|barnets: @DK|pg||
nt|brgpro: this tournament is basically for the payers living in Beijing area|pg||
nt|brolucius: How popular is bridge in China nowadays, Jack?|pg||
nt|brgpro: depends on places. very popular in beijing, shanghai...and several provinces|pg||
nt|brolucius: Some say it is declining in other countries but the USA has recently had a modest increase in registered players.|pg||
pc|cT|nt|frankaus: g'day all|pg||
nt|gracelin: both pairs of Xinyuan team play Precision.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hi all.|pg||
nt|gracelin: Hi Jordan|pg||
pc|cA|nt|barnets: may have worked|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ahollan1: likely 300 for NS -- i'd feel good bringing that score back to the table|pg||
nt|barnets: as if east had rufffed with the 9 dec would crash the spade honours|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|henryb:  Nasty breaks on this hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is the 1st of 12 matches for Round Robin  2 -- results aren't posted yet from RR1, but the rotation for RR2 is based upon final tally|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|pelu: 1nt had been a nice contract - but prob forcing - but even then I would have passed in S (pd is a passed hand)|pg||
nt|gracelin: north did not expect south has 4-card spade support|pg||
pc|sK|nt|henryb:  I do not know why East wanted a club; a heart would have been more useful|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: results site is http://www.nzbridgecongress.co.nz/pabf2010/|pg||
nt|tejjyid: not much fun discarding from the N hand|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: the Juniors are playing this in 4@CN|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Frank|pg||
nt|frankaus: part score battles are worth a suprising number of imps|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: Sorry was away from table :(  Will record a claim shortly|pg||
nt|frankaus: 6-8 for a double part score swing mounts up real quick|pg||
nt|brgpro: different case in china. membership is not important for many players|pg||
pc|h5|pc|c2|nt|brgpro: -2 become -1|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ahollan1: 13th @H might have worked well there|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|henryb:  this will drift down one, but slowly. As I have observed before, no one ever goed dowd wuickly|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|gracelin: another D and ruffing by north will return to -2|pg||
pc|s8|nt|jcwla: The OR is starting with 29 and 30 so we'll feed them comparisons when they circle back to 17.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: sorry fast play i may have missed something here|pg||
nt|brgpro: dont think they will find it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What, no Li, Wang or Chang at this table?? :)  Not in the other room either for that matter|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|pg||
nt|janm: NS have a heart, a spade and a club and EW have 5 or 6 spades (depending whether N's spade trick is taken by a ruff or not), 3 diamonds and at least 2 clubs|pg||
mc|11|nt|kiwi_joker: dummy's diamonds an alluring target - but unreachable|pg||

nt|frankaus: just 3 here|pg||
nt|sybarra: -1 not the end of the world here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: missed opportunity, but any plus may be good on that board|pg||
nt|barnets: would hav been a nice try|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi RV:) And welcome. Long time ago.|pg||
nt|rodal f: A easy 3NT?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: not sure abt made +1 , defenders likely cashed a @s+ a @c and 2 @d|pg||
nt|gracelin: don't follow the play.  Hou should not ruff the Heart.  He could get in later to draw trump|pg||
nt|h_karluk: if doesnt ruff then decl makes loser in loser|pg||
nt|brgpro: there are very active players who are not members of the bridge league here|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer made some move towards establishing the heart suit in case he could not ruff both losing clubs.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: strong or medium notrump Jack?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@H=11-15 HCP, a) 5+@H  b) 4441@D |pg||
nt|jcwla: no 2 @D's -- two went on @C KJ and one on @HJ|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|rv: this tourney is played in double round robin format with no subsequent play-offs|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: feel free anyone to commentate|pg||
nt|gracelin: This shud be an easy 4S for NS, even if East can get his Heart ruff, there's only 3 tricks for defense|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @hJ master forces to ruff or pitch stiff @c at th table|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but table had 4 dias and decl had only 2 club winner|pg||
nt|gracelin: on previous one south shud not ruff either HK or HJ, just wait to get in to draw trump|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think +1 impossible|pg||
mb|2S|nt|sybarra: can W stay in his seat |pg||
nt|sybarra: yes seems so |pg||
nt|sybarra: "stay in his seat" as in pass|pg||
nt|brgpro: easy 4@h or 3NT...|pg||
nt|gracelin: 3NT is the coldest game contract for NS, but of course, 4H also makes here.|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  6@h is a reasonable contract, needing 2-2 hearts or stiff queen|pg||
nt|henryb:  and no club ruff on lead|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Miller-Stout play precision.|pg||
nt|tejjyid: It's irrational, but I bet Nunn & Hans feel a warm fuzzy feeling inside after the good start|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  Precision remains pupolar|pg||
nt|h_karluk: allright club-system|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: wow  last hand Chinese Taipei Juniors 4@C made 5 |pg||
nt|brgpro: 14-16 is popular here but S is an old fashioned player, so i guess 13-15|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: interesting choices for Shi over 2@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N, trap pass, 3@C [@H raise], 2@D all seem to have merit|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe tryingn to get the @D suit in before the ht raise |pg||
nt|henryb:  with various conventions of their own, such as this 3@d bid to show a gf raise|pg||
nt|gracelin: so Sanchen beat 4S in the closed room to get the first blood.  But I really don't believe south (Hou) ruff HK and play CA and another club to allow 4S be made|pg||
nt|gracelin: I know Hou very well. He never made such mistakes.|pg||
nt|jcwla: BTW...any comment on @HQ from N?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 9 cards fit, don't get the idea why 3N preferred|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  *popular, sorry|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: green V red usually a go signal :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes thought he might come in  but suit is a bit tacky |pg||
nt|sybarra: my guess is we are in game force sequence here|pg||
nt|h_karluk: marked, isn't it?|pg||
nt|gracelin: thanks to south's doubleton club|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  hello to all|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hi Sveta|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ty ty fellows|pg||
mb|3C|nt|ahollan1: and protecting against opener having the 4441@D hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: Hou pulled out the 4 @s card then changed his mind|pg||
nt|tejjyid: BTW, anyone who wants to jump in and advise me I'm an idiot, do feel free|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: thinking|pg||
nt|jcwla: N's negative double showed the minors.  Now you see the problems with 2@S:|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hi Sveta|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Sveta|pg||
nt|gracelin: because 9 fast tricks, Hamdi.|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: One, it gives the opponents two levels of room; two,|pg||
nt|gracelin: just tried to catch declarer's unprepared and played HJ on that trick. |pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwi_joker: Not sure about 4@H, as Miller still apparently had the K@S to cue|pg||
nt|henryb:  3N is probably a "serious slam try, while minor suit cues would be "courtesy"|pg||
nt|rv: yes cold, @h8 ensures a stopper and only 4-0 @d break offside can trouble this contract|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I'll feel like I'm back at the bridge table|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: the more the merrier|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: i expect this will fail|pg||
nt|janm: Looks as if NS can make about 3 hearts (maybe 4) and EW can make about 3 clubs.|pg||
nt|barnets: n/s have an easy partscore in clubs|pg||
nt|pelu: Basis system: NS: Precision @c and EW: 5 card major with weak and strong NT (green-red)|pg||
nt|jcwla: it now gives E something to think about when a huge chunk of the strength of E's hand is a @S void that's of no use in defense to 4@SX.|pg||
nt|brgpro: NS can make 4@C as the cards |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|sybarra: needs the spade lead,   should be -1 |pg||
nt|janm: Let's see if EW can get the spade ruff to beat this. If W leads a high club, E can overtake to lead a spade back|pg||
nt|janm: But on the trump lead I think NS are going to make 4 hearts|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@D is a mystery|pg||
nt|gracelin: Hi Sveta|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Jack, they can't do without you!|pg||
nt|xenya: in the other room, N just bid 3N|pg||
nt|h_karluk: suitable for frequency|pg||
pc|s2|nt|tejjyid: what a nice system - pay in 8 card @D fit at 2 level |pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: no warm fuzzy things running around the table (yet)|pg||
nt|gracelin: by opening 3D EW missed a decent sacrifice here, 5D doubled is only -2|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think that very soft 2@h weak underlined many things, just helped declarer|pg||
pc|s5|nt|henryb:  I recently saw a study suggesting that with 4-3-3-3 opposite 4-4-3-2  you should not try for the 4-4 major suit fit|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Other room just started to bid Bd 18|pg||
nt|henryb:  Oh? I thought they went back to play 29 and 30|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|frankaus: has a chance but its really tough|pg||
nt|rodal f: Safe for a try by 10 tricks now.|pg||
nt|brgpro: u see, fu is playing with the boss...|pg||
nt|gracelin: lucky to find partner with DA instead of KQ|pg||
pc|cA|nt|rv: now 10 tricks possibly|pg||
pc|c5|nt|sybarra: would have to magically read the club suit I think |pg||
nt|janm: So we've had two hands in a row where the best defence would be to take ruffs.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure if i would have been any better off with 3N|pg||
nt|sybarra: well it both sounds like they have an ace the DO NOT have |pg||
nt|barnets: i think south should x and north bid 3@C|pg||
nt|pelu: very nice contract if @Hs was running - or even 4-1|pg||
nt|jcwla: Yeah it's sort of surprising at these colors that nobody took further action.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sybarra: (imho)|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: E figures to be short so playing 9@S there would have been a decent shot|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Nobuyuki Hayashi|pg||
nt|tejjyid: probably a bit early for the warm fuzzy things|pg||
nt|jcwla: E has made the trusting decision and will be rewarded.  @H's E/W have three losers off the top.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|frankaus: now @C was req|pg||
nt|pelu: I see the point - but how do u know that ps has 4-4-3-2 :)?|pg||
nt|henryb:  I am however convinced that it is losing bridge in general to bid game with two balanced hands and 24 HCP|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Wang Zhi-ge|pg||
nt|tejjyid: they like to sleep in|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: :)|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ahollan1: Reid checks to see if 2 tricks is enough to beat 6@H|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sybarra: might he be concerned spade is cashing?|pg||
nt|npcjpn: Hello from Hamilton.|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|sybarra: @H lead is bad idea now however |pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|nt|sybarra: Reid might have also been checking backs of cards to see if they match |pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: N and E starting taking the bidding cards away before Reid had a chance to X|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm told neither NS player is known for being pessimisstic -- @SA not cashing would be way beyond that description|pg||
nt|gracelin: West may underlead his CA to lose it|pg||
nt|h_karluk: say played a @s, still retains trump control|pg||
nt|h_karluk: defenders cannot cash more than @cA|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and i dont think decl careless enough to begin with @hQ|pg||
nt|gracelin: West may lose his CA if he tries the underlead.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: for now seems best defense there is to play @dJ|pg||
nt|h_karluk: in that case decl has to ruff and tackle hearts|pg||
pc|hT|nt|janm: Of course S doesn't know for certain that the spade A is onside |pg||
nt|pzpp: E-W here just bid to an unlucky game in NT, with almost every card placed badly for them|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|rodal f: ? 9 u have. By the @Shook u still have 9 if it loose.|pg||
nt|rv: Check this url http://www.nzbridgecongress.co.nz/pabf2010/Openxtab.html for all the latest standings|pg||
nt|pelu: now 8 - but "no way" to the 9. trick|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s7|nt|pelu: best play @D and try yo set up a squeeze against West|pg||
pc|sT|nt|pelu: Yes he dont want S in - but if he still not 9 tricks even with @SK right|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|janm: My typing is slower than the players' play! So on to the next hand|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hi welcome Nobuyuki, you too Roland, good luck with your move to the UK|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ahollan1: anything but @Sx works  --  but i would have thought @SA and go to next hand|pg||
nt|npcjpn: Both Ino and Teramoto are bridge professional in Japan.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|pelu: wd|pg||
nt|h_karluk: as @c A outside still cannot cash @sQ|pg||
nt|gracelin: still 11 tricks for a push|pg||
pc|h5|nt|pelu: pressure on N|pg||
nt|henryb:  it would be nice to stop in 1NT,  -- oh oh, North just gave the contract|pg||
nt|pelu: and N just discard the wrong card: @s2|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|pelu: for sure not @h9|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: thinking|pg||
nt|pelu: sorry - East can stop the @ss - :(:(:( - I will go for coffee :)|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed -- or with anything at all for that matter|pg||
nt|gracelin: Jack, I am sure Fu will raise you to 4H if you were sitting north :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: sure Patrick, however you know defenders lead advantage, i don't know how on earth North dictated that 3N while 2 times passed p there|pg||
nt|h_karluk: unless overreach 3@h|pg||
nt|brgpro: declarer can eliminate @h and @s then duck a @d|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s9|nt|pelu: now the squeeze work|pg||
pc|d4|nt|pzpp: now, taking the wrong view in @c finesse, just lose another trick|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|sybarra: shoud have made dummy ruff here?|pg||

nt|sybarra: but alas a push|pg||
nt|janm: It will be interesting to see whether the other room manages to get the ruffs to beat either of these first two contracts|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NZ Juniors also in 12@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: after 1@H-(2@C)-3@C|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Rashed Nabi Malik|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello all and welcome.|pg||
nt|gracelin: suth will pen a Precision 1C, I guess|pg||
nt|gracelin: open|pg||
nt|gracelin: north might have a way to show his 3-suiter in a positive hand.|pg||
nt|brgpro: we play different style of X then suit...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, he had 8 certain tricks in his own hand and gambled on one with partner|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I have seen worse gambles|pg||
nt|h_karluk: got it now|pg||
nt|brolucius: I was wondering if a diamond though from West would break that. Defenders can exit with a third heart, can't they?|pg||
nt|brgpro: he can later ruff out the @h then play @sK @s9 discard a @d from hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: I confess I'd also open 2@s with the S hand - everything is right - vulnerability, position, spades being the highest suit|pg||
nt|npcjpn: Ino won the senior teams in Bejing.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Nice to have RV here. All info comes:) Local time here is 0530 but free today:)|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|janm: Of course now that 2@s has been alerted, it probably showed 5 spades and a 4 or 5 card minor, so wasn't even wrong on suit length, but I think it would be right to open it even if ...|pg||
nt|janm: it was just a weak 2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: same 1@H explanation as last board|pg||
nt|npcjpn: This year, he plays in open.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Great result there for Indonesia.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 3N -srry for typo|pg||
nt|brgpro: W has to give a ruff-sluff|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: a heavy 2N|pg||
nt|barnets: with 22 hcp and good 5 card suit|pg||
nt|barnets: n./s would be s well to bid 7N as 6 |pg||
nt|barnets: 13  tricks without club lead|pg||
nt|h_karluk: likely 2N for NS, however who knows|pg||
mb|1S!|nt|sybarra: ok now can e/w find and make slam? |pg||
nt|ahollan1: notes say Newell has 6@S --- i believe the notes|pg||
nt|sybarra: or can they really make 6 @D without help?|pg||
nt|henryb:  we changed boards all of a sudden|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: the match to watch|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 2@H was Mm 2-suiter, weak (youcouldguess, right?)|pg||
nt|jcwla: 20/20 hand here - always want to post the plus on these.|pg||
nt|gracelin: this one should be a routine 4H|pg||
nt|brgpro: that's why i said as the cards they are|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: east is marginal for a 4N raise|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Cards are nicely placed for NT.|pg||
mb|1N|an| |nt|sybarra: 2 @C looks like "single suited"  |pg||
nt|sybarra: my guess is W can tell which suit |pg||
nt|frankaus: sys on  here is normal these days with X replacing 21C|pg||
nt|janm: N probably has a good idea that his partner's second suit is clubs and so won't be useful, but it's certainly possible to envision game anyway.|pg||
nt|pelu: 3NT on @dQ|pg||
nt|henryb:  2N clearly a @s raise|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i meant 1@h artificial|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: yes and systems on= transfer in this case |pg||
nt|ahollan1: interference will slow down EW|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes|pg||
nt|sybarra: with bidding opps suits |pg||
nt|rv: Hi Barnet and all specs|pg||
nt|barnets: hi|pg||
nt|rv: it is 9 AM IST here in India which is 4.30 hrs ahead of London time at this time of the year.|pg||
nt|pelu: A problem for E - this bidding could in precision be on 11+5|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that shld b xfer|pg||
mb|2C|an| |nt|ahollan1: hard to believe both red suits behaving favorably -- and will probably misguess both Qs anyway|pg||
nt|brgpro: anytime W switch to a @d wont help, declarer can throw him in with a @s|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: olmost certainly its @H now that S trans to @S|pg||
nt|sybarra: and wrong colors to be stepping in with 3 @D |pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry with 3 @C I meant|pg||
nt|brgpro: discard a @d from hand, a ruff-sluff always comes|pg||
nt|h_karluk: now this may be oen of the flattest boards of the round at NS+630|pg||
nt|h_karluk: *one of|pg||
mb|2D|an| |nt|janm: I don't know what options he had to invite over the DBL (surely 3@s was not invitational). I think S is going to come to 10 tricks, and he'd probably have accepted most ...|pg||
nt|janm: invitations, with maximum values and good spots in both suits|pg||
nt|tejjyid: nothing very frightening about this contract, orindeed 4@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: yes|pg||
nt|jcwla: The stakes are raised here, though not into game.|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: looks to be a playable spot |pg||
nt|friggi: sure it does|pg||
nt|sybarra: actually 3 nt will work for e/w |pg||
nt|rv: my apologies for the delay, signing in from sunny Bangalore in South India|pg||
nt|barnets: i thnk north will lead a @H|pg||
nt|rv: after 6@d, can North consider an attacking lead?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: not much to the play here worst he can lose 3@S 1@D|pg||
nt|pzpp: yes, and the lead helps declarer ahead in the race for tricks|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|pelu: same strat as the bidding in Board 1|pg||
nt|henryb:  2@d is apparently a transfer|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: now makes many|pg||
nt|npcjpn: 10 tricks, next board.|pg||
nt|henryb:  3@c is a non-standard rebid -- and since I do not have the CC handy, I cannot tell you what it shows|pg||
nt|brgpro: 2@d is not transfer, but GF stayman|pg||
nt|h_karluk: another 12-14 NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  but this time I think S whould bid 2N|pg||
nt|brgpro: 13-15|pg||
nt|brgpro: 14-16 rather|pg||
nt|h_karluk: sorry EW|pg||
mb|3N|nt|frankaus: welcome fridrik|pg||
nt|friggi: ty Frank|pg||
nt|ahollan1: did NS do well here or not?   only the shadow knows|pg||
nt|tejjyid: pick the trumps & prety much claim|pg||
nt|gracelin: Looks like a Precision sequence, a game forcing 2D followed by a natural 3H.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: wouldn't be surprised if same contract without interference|pg||
nt|pzpp: good shift|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: the reson behind the spade is|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: That is his strength:) the @S suit.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: oh i played that long years ago, 2 way stayman , 2D promises game|pg||
nt|Walddk2: ´ó¼ÒºÃ  to our Chinese viewers (not sure what it means, though) :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: 4H is doomed to lose 1S + 2H + 1C.  3NT will also go down if East leads low spade and finds club shift in time. |pg||
nt|brgpro: Ew play big @c with a lot of transfer responses, with ot without competition|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sybarra: hi Fridrik :)  welcome|pg||
nt|friggi: Hi Syirley|pg||
nt|janm: Miller knows  that the DBL was a little light, so expects W to have only one spade, and takes the spade finesse|pg||
nt|sybarra: some kibber (or you Al)  I am still triying to figure out if e/w can handle 6 @D|pg||
nt|h_karluk: to set 3N careful defense cooeration required|pg||
nt|gracelin: looks like 11 tricks now|pg||
nt|brgpro: EW are both very creative players...just, sometimes too creative...|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s9|nt|frankaus: 5 imps to NS here|pg||
nt|barnets: dec has not spades from 6@D bid|pg||
nt|rv: if opps don't have source of tricks and just enough values it pays to passive, after 6@h there was a chance for North to consider @c lead|pg||
nt|rv: N-S are close to making 10 tricks in @h strain|pg||
nt|h_karluk: *cooperation & collaboration|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, East needs to duck the first Heart, take the second and shift to club.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: :)|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|henryb:  ah. I misread the opening bid: a strong club, and 2N probably 11-13 with no 5 card major|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  last year, in Transnational Mixed teams in Beijing, there were a lot of home teams at the start. I can't remember a team without Precision.|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h4|nt|ahollan1: nah -- stop thinking about that when realize not biddable|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h7|pg||
pc|c5|nt|friggi: sorry shirley|pg||

nt|henryb:  He had a prime 15 count ( I actually make it closer to 17) |pg||
nt|sybarra: ok :)  save brain powere|pg||

nt|Walddk2: http://www.ccba.org.cn/Tour/TourIndex.aspx?tourid=255  for the tournament website in Chinese Simplified; use Google for translation|pg||
pc|c6|nt|barnets: dummy did not check for majors|pg||
nt|rv: after 6@d|pg||
nt|barnets: er must have 5 spades|pg||
nt|npcjpn: no possibility for 11 tricks, West should claim.|pg||
nt|rodal f: A possible IMp board for NS.3@S EW? Seems on.|pg||
nt|gracelin: when Heart is played from dummy, East can take the 1st one.  |pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|pg||
pc|sT|nt|friggi: dont like this line of playing|pg||
nt|brgpro: the main reason is: for a pick up partnership, precision is easier to control|pg||

nt|pelu: I dont understand a system , where u cant play 1NT - I know it is popular also in USA - but "I love to play against that system" :)|pg||
nt|pelu: ??|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sybarra: what would you do differently? |pg||
pc|c2|pc|cA|nt|janm: I'm still predicting 10 tricks, although I'm not sure exactly how the play will go - probably will lead up to the diamonds when he finds out the clubs aren't coming in|pg||
nt|jcwla: It's now or never for Karwur.|pg||
nt|gracelin: And he finds the necessary club shit ? |pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|friggi: fin for K in W|pg||
nt|sybarra: well it all came back  |pg||
nt|gracelin: sift, srry|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i don't predict there would be any mis-time the play and blank one of dummy's sources in the endgame won't have much company|pg||
pc|h6|nt|h_karluk: shift|pg||
nt|gracelin: shift|pg||
nt|gracelin: srr for my poor typing|pg||
nt|h_karluk: its ok buddy|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer may play another Heart, hoping either CK is with East or East is out of club.  But that play will result in -2|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think best is cash 4 @d|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|pelu: not the best defense :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: oh yes, d hook a must and rest details|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|rv: I would have competed to 3@c via 2n (to show weaker hand) with West hand|pg||
pc|s6|nt|janm: Or the defenders will lead diamonds for him, making the play faster as now he can claim|pg||
nt|h_karluk: then exit with a @c|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ahollan1: claim early - claim often|pg||
nt|rnmalik: -1, now|pg||
pc|s8|pc|d2|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  indeed, if the whole community plays one system, there is no problem with partner|pg||
nt|h_karluk: what about creativity:)|pg||
nt|brolucius: The entries to dummy were not present to play on diamonds instead, even if declarer wins the opening lead in his hand.|pg||
nt|brgpro: actually in china, i would say 50/50 playing prec. or nat. sustems|pg||
pc|hK|nt|brgpro: system|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|gracelin: that way you lose when East starts with one club|pg||
pc|h9|nt|pelu: but it is the first (morning?) match - so Jerr also need coffee :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: oops|pg||
nt|jcwla: Never it is.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: discussion now at table !|pg||
nt|h_karluk: shld wait on 8 trix and step w a @c|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|h8|nt|pzpp: sure|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d8|nt|rv: that would still have not stopped North from bidding 3@h, not sure if anyone will bid further|pg||
nt|rodal f: Do 2NT also tell semi "S?|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|rv: these are very small countries (islands) in pacific, it is really good that they are fielding teams making bridge a truly global sport|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ahollan1: hmmm maybe pop-up squeeze|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|c7|pc|d6|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d9|nt|ahollan1: yes!|pg||
nt|brgpro: but for mixed pdships, they would prefer prec. |pg||

mb|p|nt|friggi: ye sbut regardless, why give it away without fightingÐ|pg||
nt|friggi: ?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 2nd one, 1st missed, played 3N|pg||
nt|brolucius: Should be easy, once South shows his heart suit.|pg||
mb|1C|an| |nt|sybarra: this looks precision-ish |pg||
nt|frankaus: 3NT is likely here|pg||
nt|cascade: does this meet your standard for 2NT Jan?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: does not meet my standard, but i might do it anyway|pg||
nt|brgpro: an easy one i must say|pg||
mb|p|nt|friggi: sure it is|pg||
nt|janm: I probably wouldn't do it vul, but it's certainly close - I can't imagine bidding anything except 2NT or P|pg||
nt|cascade: 3@c will be invitational with hearts|pg||
nt|janm: Presumably 3@c shows some sort of heart raise|pg||
nt|cascade: and Miller finds himself with a surprisingly good hand for all of the bidding so far|pg||
nt|janm: Everyone has different approaches to Unusual, but as far as I know everyone plays that the cue bids show partner's suit and the 4th suit (although some of us use one and some the ...|pg||
nt|janm: other for those meanings)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=ART, STR, F1, (good 13)14+ HCP unbal, 15+ HCP BAL|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: may be too hard to find|pg||
nt|rv: French Polynesia is doing a lot better than New Caledonia in this tourney|pg||
nt|h_karluk: were 27 hcp and no game|pg||
nt|gracelin: But on the other hand, 4 round of D may subject East to some discard problem|pg||
mb|1H!|nt|cascade: yes there are various ways|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not sure about 4@C|pg||
nt|janm: Yes, especially with partner bidding 2NT vulnerable, Miller must wonder if his side has a game|pg||
nt|cascade: 3@c tied to hearts and 3@d tied to spades|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: a transfer over the transfer|pg||
nt|npcjpn: looks like Michaels.|pg||
nt|brgpro: esp. after a big @c|pg||
nt|h_karluk: oh sorry i think it was 6 red, previous round|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: and it is precision  (just not sure which variety) |pg||
nt|frankaus: communications wont be easy |pg||
nt|cascade: personally i play the lower cue agrees partner's suit and the higher is the other suit|pg||
nt|janm: As it is, it's pretty unlucky that 4@c goes down|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=FG, 8+ HCP, 5+@D|pg||
nt|npcjpn: dbl = 3-card support?|pg||
nt|henryb:  the black kings are well placed foe N-S|pg||

mb|p|nt|friggi: but np for 3NT|pg||

nt|gracelin: whether the south hand worth a Vul. 2-level overcall has been argued for years.|pg||
nt|brolucius: North must discover that South does not hold @Sx-x-x.|pg||
mb|p|nt|friggi: transfer|pg||

nt|friggi: thne 3H then 3NT|pg||

nt|friggi: 3NT is cold|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it might get you way too high and also misdirect the lead|pg||
nt|henryb:  I do not agree with 3N: I think that should show tricks, and 2N should show 18-19 balanced|pg||

nt|henryb:  this is the only lead to beat 6N|pg||
nt|pelu: No they play 11-14 NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Newell has extra King for his 1st seat 1@C -- but can't imagine anything other than 3N now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N is discouraging, but since Reid unlimited it is not pure signoff|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Liu still has chance to splinter|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: EW have ended in 5@H on  18|pg||
nt|rv: FP is lying 8th and NC is lying 13th out of 13 teams with 3/4th of tourney over|pg||
nt|pelu: 6@s easy slam to make|pg||
nt|fabsayc: good afternoon from partly cloudy vancouver|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and there were 7NT as far as i remember|pg||
mb|3H|nt|sybarra: nice of @D's to break |pg||
nt|barnets: but never bid|pg||
nt|barnets: only -200|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3@S0single and force til min 4@H|pg||
nt|rv: I might have opened 1@d and rebid 1n with north hand|pg||
nt|gracelin: Good decision to pass.  South may regret his overcall.|pg||
nt|gracelin: winners of every match get a prize of about US$150.  |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Can 2@C be 5-4 either way, Patrick?|pg||
mb|p|nt|cascade: Jan tells me she plays the cues the exact opposite way to me|pg||
nt|cascade: the most important thing is that you have an agreement with your partner|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think 3c for hearts, 3d for spades is the most common|pg||
nt|janm: This time we have a game where the declaring side will need ruffs (diamonds) to make it, I think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S asks controls   A=2 K=1|pg||
nt|rv: North could have chanced 3@c with enough distribution though suit is not good at these colors|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: slam chances looking rather slim|pg||
nt|npcjpn: yes, that's I am afraid of.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: he's done it|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Chung now has a Powerhouse|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 1d opening won't appeal to everyone holding west's cards but it will be a popular choice in many sys card there|pg||
mb|4C|nt|kiwibridge: twin 50's on 18 to Japan for 3 imps|pg||
nt|npcjpn: 4@s, just splinter? or exclusion RKCB?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I hate the pass of 2NT here|pg||
nt|brgpro: 13 top tricks in NT, 14 or 15 in @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|cascade: and the defense have ruffs to beat it |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N=3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so the hand with void gets to declare?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: contemplating 5@C opposite @SK and @HA?|pg||
nt|barnets: he also may have tried 3@C over 2@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: 2@h alerted|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: laughing :)|pg||
mb|4N!|nt|janm: Although if he takes the club finesse he's been offered (right you are that the club bid got them off to the wrong lead), he can pitch the diamond losers and then just needs to ...|pg||
nt|janm: avoid a spade ruff (or S needs to figure things out and give his partner one, which may be hard)|pg||
nt|janm: So that will be a third hand that could have been defeated by a defensive ruff |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: if so then pass =3|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 9 for @H switch, is it?|pg||
nt|gracelin: trump shift now|pg||
nt|jcwla: Sad to see W rewarded for that opener.|pg||
nt|gracelin: They are all Precisioners.|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, that's the way I play.  But I know people put emphasis on club and obnly promises 5-card C|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: a not so obvious @D lead/switch can couse lots of communications problems|pg||
nt|sybarra: club lead gets a bit messy |pg||
nt|rv: West opening is post-modern, I like his raise to 2@s with 3 card fit instead of 2@d|pg||
nt|pelu: Wellcome to Martin Johnson from Canada|pg||
nt|gracelin: six tricks seem to be the limit for declarer|pg||
nt|brolucius: If 1NT was natural, perhaps it denied three spades, which would be useful information for North.|pg||
mb|5S!|nt|friggi: no problem. play for @D 3-3 |pg||
nt|pelu: so 2Nt would be 16-17 (18)|pg||
nt|rv: all of us like to upgrade the hand more often than downgrade, here North hand is clear candidate to downgrade|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: i think in new zealand would be simpler to alert natural bids|pg||
nt|brgpro: N doeant need @cQ to bid 7@H|pg||
mb|7H|nt|ahollan1: interesting -- could only do that because of @H10|pg||
nt|ahollan1: glad i'm not at the table -- as declarer i'd go into long tank because of too many possible lines|pg||
nt|npcjpn: nice bidding.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: should be a formality to make it now, wd|pg||
nt|pelu: agree - 2NT is a bid u dont play - either 3Nt or 3@c|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think 1@D followed by 2@C is systemic in Precision|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: How may HP would u have shoved me by that sequense RV?|pg||
nt|brolucius: 4@C was a cue-bid and 4NT doubtless RKCB, hearing of two aces and the queen of hearts.|pg||
nt|brgpro: so an easy 7 bid|pg||
nt|brgpro: a coffee hand i think|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  for play, yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  because I think you need 3N to show a very different hand: say Ax, xxx, AKQxxxx, Q|pg||
nt|ahollan1: a) @S ruff  b) @SQ @CAK float @DQ c) @SK then ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: 5@CX on its way down three - would be even from S.  Was all set to praise S's discretion.|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: where grant showed four spades is unclear|pg||
nt|pelu: 5 rounds of bidding - just to miss a laydown slam :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: bids being explained|pg||
nt|fabsayc: in my methods north bids 2@S over the tranfer advance|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so we can focus on slam bidding rather than game|pg||
nt|pzpp: I think that they play UDCA, just discourage|pg||
nt|brolucius: A lot of cold grand slams do not turn out to be coffee hands, but it was always likely on this particular one.|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  they did well in bidding|pg||
pc|h3|nt|janm: Declarer going after those diamond ruffs - but that will probably make it easier for S to realize he needs his partner to have a spade ruff coming, won't it?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but as he did not discard a diamond i dont see how defense can go wrong|pg||
nt|pelu: I am told: 1@S = asking bid in @s, 2@D = 5 card !, (2 top) 2@H asking in @h - 2@S no @h-control|pg||
mc|13|nt|pelu: but 3@c would prob be X - so...|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Thanks PEter, you have precisely expressed my view NT isinv/forc|pg||

nt|frankaus: brb|pg||
nt|friggi: but N should never play@H|pg||
nt|sybarra: club lead was key for defense |pg||
nt|janm: very tricky hand, obviously, and difficult for declarer to realize that it was necessary to do the very unintuitive thing of stranding the club A in dummy|pg||
nt|henryb:  is that desirable?|pg||
nt|pelu: no but that their system|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right -- i still don't know best line -- even looking at all hands|pg||
nt|rodal f: One thing is to precume if u show less than u have. An other thing is to show ure pard what u have.|pg||
nt|pelu: I play Cue bids grom a ballanced hand, and asking bids from the other hand  |pg||
nt|fabsayc: either that or initial control responses of some kind|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: sorry they got a bit fast then !|pg||
nt|pelu: 5@d - bit not 3NT|pg||
nt|gracelin: a close 3NT for NS.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 20-20 1st time|pg||
nt|brgpro: the play and defence in 4@s will be interesting here|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 37th board|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: unfav 1st/2nd = 131-15|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: or 13-15|pg||
nt|sybarra: :)|pg||
nt|rv: North's hand is close to an upgarde for 15-17 nt range|pg||
nt|barnets: north has a super max and 4@S will make|pg||
nt|rv: some might open 1@c and rebid 2n|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so the asking bids are in a range context|pg||
nt|gracelin: South will be more cautious in making his Vul. 2-level overcall|pg||
nt|brolucius: Despite that grand slam, there has been little excitement in the deals so far. It will come (we hope...)|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: 1m - 1M - 3NT is the hand u show|pg||
nt|ahollan1: TRF |pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Looks like Norths diamonds vs the opps respective hearts and spades in this one|pg||
nt|pzpp: agree, players just think for a long time, then play like zip,zip, zip|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: they do not always show their cards|pg||
nt|rnmalik: np-look what a hand anything beyond 5@C by NS, the trouble starts.|pg||
nt|gracelin: probably due to fail, though.|pg||
mb|2C|nt|friggi: play E for High @S |pg||
nt|friggi: let opps play @H|pg||
nt|barnets: i prefer that yes|pg||
nt|barnets: too strong for 1N|pg||
nt|henryb:  North's diamonds do not win the battle|pg||
nt|tejjyid: may be tough to decide though|pg||
nt|gracelin: another Precision auction, 1S shows a positive hand with Heart.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Good to get a board like that in early for E/W -- sets a great tone, "You will be punished if you step out of line"|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: what system for new zealand|pg||
nt|janm: Also hard for N to realize that he needed to play the second club to cut declarer's communications :) (I'm not sure why declarer had played the heart ten though - if he hadn't he'd ...|pg||
nt|janm: have been able to overtake the heart J)|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: 4@S by E has chances but the bad break should scuttle it|pg||
nt|pelu: no - I am old Acol-player, so distribution forst - that can improve a hand - and then cue/asking|pg||
mb|2H|nt|friggi: @C lead not enough|pg||
nt|sybarra: do you ever super accept with weaker nts?|pg||
nt|sybarra: I dont play them, so just asking |pg||
nt|ahollan1: i was just going to say that Newell COULD have bid 3@H as SSGT super-accept  [short suit game try]|pg||
nt|sybarra: for an older person such as me,  I would have to do too much "re-thnking" of system |pg||
nt|henryb:  Is 2@d a transfer or an amorphous force?|pg||
nt|rodal f: 4@S ok by 100% hit by the guesses. Might 3NT is better. But....|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3NT an easy make.|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: South will pass here in all likelihood, if he had Inv strength he would have Xed 2@c to set up forcing auction till 2n|pg||
nt|h_karluk: oh yes they want to be in NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So strong club for the boss, unlike Fu and Jack who play natural 2/1|pg||
nt|gracelin: south's 1NT is limited to 7 HCP the most, and could have less.  So north may give up.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: no overtricks in @s contract|pg||
mb|2S|nt|janm: Can't tell from the auction, can we? 1@c was alerted, as was 1@d. I'd have said we still didn't know from the alert to 1@c, but probably now it was a strong club and negative ...|pg||
nt|janm: diamond - still not certain|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i am told precision|pg||
nt|janm: And what was 2@c by East?|pg||
nt|henryb:  West now emerges with 3N?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i started old -- thinking systems has helped me regress|pg||
nt|sybarra: One Kib suggested bidding  3@H over 2@H (4 crd support, xx in @H)|pg||
nt|barnets: so n/s miss a decent game patly as a rsult|pg||
nt|rv: South chose to pass 2@c and subsequently 2@h since he suspected misfit|pg||
nt|rv: at MPs, many of us would act with South hand|pg||
nt|barnets: cant see why south did not bid 2@S|pg||
nt|xenya: 2N by N now, passing the bucket|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, you play whatever the boss plays, Roland.  Is that a rule ?|pg||
nt|brolucius: West may need a transfer break to promote him to game. No, he has started with Stayman.|pg||
nt|brgpro: W elected to start with stayman, then 2@s shows an invitational hand with 5@s and prob. unbal. hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwi_joker: the latter i believe|pg||
nt|rv: not my choice for 2@c opening if it shows strong hand|pg||
nt|tejjyid: still, perhaps theywill explore for 6@D and stop in !5|pg||
nt|jcwla: Uncomfortable decision now for S -- has alerady seen a much better 6-card suit than this go for 800 a level lower.|pg||
mb|4S|nt|sybarra: certainly gave S, someproblems |pg||
nt|npcjpn: Facing passed partner?|pg||
nt|pelu: here my "favorit" convention (when opp play): 1NT F1 :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|friggi: the mistake was made by N leading @H after overtaking|pg||
nt|sybarra: N was dummy |pg||
nt|friggi: sorry|pg||
nt|sybarra: just "followed suit" |pg||
nt|friggi: dec|pg||
nt|pelu: almost 8 playing trick - and good gamble here|pg||
nt|barnets: at any scoring|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: 6H is a perfect contract for NS.  Guess NS will be there after a few cue bids.|pg||
nt|brgpro: i think he might manage 9 tricks though|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think North thinking a way to describe his hand further , ie 2N|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: After a strong club and negative diamond, I'd have thought 2@c would be natural|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not forcing, was passed hand|pg||
nt|pelu: are u sure -they have some support-hands in 1NT|pg||
nt|jcwla: CR having conn probs|pg||
nt|brolucius: They play that as invitational with spades. Some use the sequence to show a 2NT raise with four spades.|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|sybarra: and another challenging hand |pg||
nt|sybarra: easier for us than at the table|pg||
nt|friggi: yes, sure it is|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: indeed, this won't make|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well i am just saying i dont play it forcing in this auction|pg||
nt|gracelin: south might bid 5H over 4D to ask spade control directly|pg||
nt|h_karluk: oh yes he bid that|pg||
nt|gracelin: a Heart lead will probably beat it.  |pg||
nt|Walddk2: There is also a rule 2. If you don't agree with the boss, rule 1 will apply automatically|pg||
nt|gracelin: but West will likely lead a D, which helps declarer|pg||
nt|h_karluk: good news no specific shortage at both sides|pg||
nt|brgpro: but looks like a @D lead...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i do not see any well rewarding lead in the scoring except @d4|pg||
nt|brgpro: interesting bd here, either way can win ( i mean declarer or defence)|pg||
pc|c6|nt|fabsayc: apparently natual is passe|pg||
nt|pelu: here pd had the cards he need: @S-stopper, help in @H and 3 card @d so the suit is running|pg||
nt|tejjyid: to Nunn, the @H & @C valuesall look wated|pg||
nt|tejjyid: wasted|pg||
nt|pelu: Its a real top-match, Australia no 2 and Indonesia No 3, Taipie No 1|pg||
nt|gracelin: he did just that.|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|fabsayc: natural|pg||
nt|barnets: n/s have the balance of points and the spade suit|pg||
nt|npcjpn: at least undoubled:)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I don't like a system where West can't show the @D support on this hand though|pg||
nt|pelu: results: http://www.nzbridgecongress.co.nz/pabf2010/Openxtab.html |pg||
nt|h_karluk: good hands good suits with cover cards|pg||
nt|brgpro: with @hQ as entry, he will do it i think|pg||
nt|gracelin: Jin gave credit to Fu's play by not passing 1NT.  Fu gave himself credit by accepting.|pg||
nt|brgpro: talking about playing with boss, Gunnar Hallberg is obvioualy an expert|pg||
nt|brgpro: still, u dont have 10 tricks, |pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|rv: good lead giving nothing away|pg||
nt|fabsayc: is one 10 in hearts from a decent game|pg||
pc|h8|nt|friggi: that is nice:)|pg||
nt|janm: The bidding is more interesting than the play on this hand. It's out of our "ruffs to beat" set of hands, just a boring 10 top tricks, 3 losers |pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: no emotion shown !|pg||
nt|pzpp: facing 3NT, Lin had a big decision to make, his hand appears to be sourceful of tricks, just need a good @c suit and @s control to envisage slam|pg||
nt|pzpp: not sure of their agreement here, is 4NT just a general interest and natural invitation?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: ask about the 3@s bid|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  but even this helful lead doesn't mean taht play is over|pg||
nt|xenya: can be beaten if E wins and returns a @H, but tough|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  *that|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so far winning decision not much unique|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sybarra: playing J to see if he can get accurate count |pg||
nt|pelu: yes missing @H10 not so bad - need a @c-lead to defeat|pg||
pc|h4|nt|pzpp: 3@s could be just a cuebid for @s stopper for NT purpose|pg||
nt|rnmalik: all cards badly placed, other than missing 2Aces, the Q@H.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: yes opps were asking|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|brgpro: once he told me, when playing with ur boss, the first thing u shd know is not the system or convention, but how much sugar he needs for his coffee!!|pg||
nt|h_karluk: there are 2 aces and 2 Kings needs to be knocked out|pg||
nt|gracelin: Good advice.  There are something to learn everyday :)|pg||
nt|brgpro: u have 3 side tricks, so need 7 trump tricks to come, the only way to do it is to ruff 2@c with @sAK|pg||
nt|brgpro: so if N switches to a trump now...|pg||
pc|cT|nt|friggi: this line is better the play for 3-3 @C|pg||
nt|friggi: then|pg||
nt|janm: I'm told that 2@c showed either diamonds or the Majors|pg||
nt|rv: declarer can still mis-guess all suits, generally trump lead is worthwhile if 1 hand is known to be very strong|pg||
nt|tejjyid: IMO, 3@D is mandatory aafter 2@S - assuming it's GF|pg||
nt|xenya: now declarer got a tempo |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  @h shift works even now|pg||
pc|c8|nt|rv: if South doubles 2@C and subsequently bids 2@S it is likely to be forcing, passing 2@c and bidding 2@s should be NF|pg||
pc|cK|nt|rv: South took conservative route since he suspected misfit/bad breaks|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|cascade: suction|pg||
nt|pelu: I play 2@S FG, and then 3@D id the obvius bid over 2NT|pg||
nt|tejjyid: me to|pg||
nt|brgpro: now he makes i think|pg||
pc|h6|nt|jcwla: Meanwhile, 17 and 18 have come in -- 17 just 2 to Indonesia for staying a level lower in @H's, but 18 the big one: 14 to Indonesia for 800 here and 100 in OR against 5@HX.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Those are the type of boards that decide IMPs matches.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: 10@s played in error, penalty card|pg||
nt|xenya: to set up a club trick|pg||
nt|brgpro: even on @h shift now, wouldn't E be thrown in at the end?|pg||
nt|gracelin: maybe too late, declarer doesn't need to establish both minor suit winner, East wll be end-played at the end to yield an extra trick for declarer.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|h_karluk: Xu HOU is a World Master, in Shanghai 2007  XINYUANKONGGU - Transnational Teams, also Beijing 2008 - Transnational Teams A - EVERTRUST HOLDING GROUP were his teams|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|fabsayc: that has the unattractive name of suction|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right -- i think that's what I said Shirley -- but it is not obligatory [especially with min]|pg||
nt|gracelin: of course, declarer might not know how the cards lie and may play for spades to break.|pg||
nt|gracelin: Wang, over 100-millions Wang are rooting for you to take HK.|pg||
nt|brgpro: i put up $1 for making|pg||

nt|h_karluk: will fare wretchedly, but it's more difficult to predict as east just how badly +600 will score|pg||
pc|s7|nt|tejjyid: buti once played fit-showing jumps as well, so I couldstart with 2@H|pg||
pc|s2|nt|tejjyid: That's a good method, but it doesn't happen often enough to take up a whole bid|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|pelu: Taipei bid the slam and found their 6 trick against 3@H = 8 + 13 IMP|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s8|nt|pzpp: to make the hand, declarer may have to take @h finesse to dispose his 1d duece|pg||
pc|s3|nt|pzpp: @d2|pg||

nt|friggi: agree|pg||
nt|henryb:  4@s or 1?|pg||
nt|sybarra: and I think S put his queen of hts in his pocket, even without the @H bid by W |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I thought -2 claim accepted|pg||
nt|h_karluk: in 2008 they were Bronze Medalists|pg||
nt|ritong: pat does not, he prudently put a condition|pg||
nt|brgpro: u dont have i am afraid, but i will be glad to take 1 euro instead|pg||
nt|brgpro: i think he will go down|pg||
nt|brolucius: Both sides did well to bid the game anyway. At the other table, West made a normal transfer response and raised the 2@S rebid to 3@S, That was good evaluation.|pg||
mb|1N|nt|henryb:  I would bid 4|pg||
nt|rv: have the rains stopped in South Island?|pg||
nt|gracelin: NS may get highest mark to reach 4S in a bidding contest.  Not here as West is waiting with 5-card spades.|pg||
nt|ritong: assuming you keep the lead til the end, though|pg||
nt|brgpro: W will raise to 3NT with 4333|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: bidding it more of a challenge now |pg||
nt|friggi: not good bid at all|pg||
nt|janm: New Zealand's IMPs came from board 2, where EW were allowed to play in 4@c and didn't make it (so that was a chance for a Hong Kong pickup if they'd gotten the spade ruff to beat ...|pg||
nt|janm: 4@h)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=ART, STR, F1, (good 13)14+ HCP unbal, 15+ HCP BAL|pg||
nt|rv: 2@c is possibly single suiter here|pg||
nt|brgpro: after @h lead, only need @s guess to land|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, you can see that 4@S has plenty of losers to cope with. That is exactly why 3NT is recommended on 4-3-3-3 shape.|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: The Hong Kong IMPs are from board 3, where the HK N bid game over his partner's 2@s opener|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it gets stronger in 3rd/4th|pg||
nt|barnets: 3N makes for 600 against 2@DX for 500|pg||
nt|brgpro: 14-16 NT they play i believe|pg||

nt|ahollan1: DBL=6-9 HCP|pg||
nt|pelu: partscore hand in @s or @h|pg||
nt|pzpp: NS may reach another doomed 3NT|pg||
nt|gracelin: Let's bet for bigger things.  Brazil or Italy ?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Spain|pg||
nt|brgpro: pass?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sybarra: and E  does not have a good cue here   qx of @H's not easy |pg||
nt|sybarra: oh good E bid 5 @C |pg||
nt|pelu: U can find CC's on: http://www.pabf2010.co.nz/Participants/Convention-Cards/Open/Australia.aspx|pg||
nt|ritong: sorry about that, i m not a soccer fan|pg||
nt|ritong: undo|pg||
nt|brgpro: W must have mis-sorted his hand|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i do not know, pass shld be a speculative choice|pg||
nt|brgpro: missed 1 A or K|pg||
pc|h9|nt|friggi: right|pg||
nt|henryb:  So did East: 4@d shows a good 4@s.|pg||
nt|pelu: also my bid - the hand is too weak to 4@D (namyats)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C takes them out of relay mode -- i think|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: meanwhile closed room seems to have gone to sleep|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Hans must have missorted his cards|pg||
nt|brgpro: Italy????? I am afraid u r not up to date patrick|pg||
pc|h5|nt|henryb:  I think Namyats should be a better hand than that|pg||
nt|pelu: CC: just a solid suit - but I agree with u|pg||
nt|pelu: and not "solid" :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  My rules (back when I played it) was no 3-loser suit, and not two suits with two fast losers|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or maybe DBL is relay -- i'm just not sure :(|pg||
nt|rv: at any other colors, West will gleefully doube 2@d, he is likely to bid 3n at these colors|pg||
nt|pelu: Grant like to bid - but he has no bid|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|ritong: but, as R does, i would be glad to see spain winning it|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|sybarra: is this a slam that is biddable?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it is very possible that 3@H=exact shape|pg||
nt|rodal f: The lead at match and team is? not @C but thrumph.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the all seasons double comes to his rescue|pg||
nt|pelu: a slow X = pd my distribution is not OK :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: now should pass|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|vugraphzkt: nope :(|pg||
nt|pzpp: I think that Mr. Lin had a misunderstanding of this 3@c|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: thinking|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i guess 2@h wld be nice instea of 2@c|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sybarra: 3 @D bid not recommended at home |pg||
nt|sybarra: or maybe only at home LOL|pg||
nt|friggi: agree|pg||
nt|friggi: helps W to count that hands|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe "we" are on our way |pg||
nt|ahollan1: so YES Shirley|pg||
nt|tejjyid: itsvery disciplined to take 2 passes on that hand; mabe he will balance over 3@H?|pg||
nt|gracelin: The whole Xinyuan team represented China in the 47th PABF championships played in New Zealand in late May.|pg||
nt|gracelin: NS play a 10-12 mini-1NT opening. |pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|janm: 3@s presumably Smolen, showing a game force with 4 spades and 5 hearts, so that partner can play the hand in hearts; they know they don't have an 8 card fit in spades already|pg||
nt|fabsayc: what to lead|pg||
nt|janm: 3NT is going to be very difficult to make here|pg||
nt|rv: E-W playing negative doubles and forcing pass till 2n after double by West to set up forcing auction|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Kaz Yamada|pg||
nt|npcjpn: now the lead is very important.|pg||
nt|rodal f: How many have missed how many times there:)|pg||
nt|xenya: 4@H here|pg||
nt|gracelin: I accept Italy if the stakes are right, say 1 : 100.|pg||
mc|9|nt|cascade: what do you lead from Miller's hand knowing that declarer is probably 4=3 in spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2 Key Cards + @HQ|pg||
nt|sybarra: but when I bid these,  hts are always 4/1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: lucky -- mine 5-0|pg||

nt|janm: I was wondering about that too - I don't see how he could have done that, but does declarer really have time to set up a club? Say he leads the club Q, now what? North has better ...|pg||
nt|janm: club spots than declarer|pg||
nt|sybarra: note the spade suit play |pg||
nt|rv: strong start by Aus pair in this room|pg||
nt|rv: series of good boards|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: and that won't be a great result for China either|pg||
nt|rv: steady start by new Caledonia here, no drops so far from bottom placed team in the table|pg||
nt|pelu: a kiwi surrender - never :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: grant said good choice of suit !|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Testing hands.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: what a silent partner|pg||
nt|brolucius: Smoking out the @SQ with a lead of the @SJ is a trick that East would rather have performed in 3NT.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: good point Shirley -- must admit that i missed the safety play :(|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=3-10 HCP, 4+@S & 4+@C/@D|pg||
mb|2C|nt|fabsayc: but defense does not have enough tricks then|pg||
nt|janm: Declarer has 2 spades, 2 hearts, 2 diamonds (if he uses the club and heart aces for diamond finesses), 1 club, he really can't find 2 more tricks, can he?|pg||
nt|rv: no one likes to finish last and lose too many matches, pride of every bridge player|pg||
nt|tejjyid: They were in 4? OK, I take back my underbidding crack|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: sorry missed a bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: ehaa......for the S bid |pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry  2-8 HCP  --  i should copy/paste instead of trying to use recall|pg||
nt|sybarra: might be their system others call it Every, Hand An Adventure (EHAA)|pg||
nt|pzpp: precision 2@c|pg||
nt|gracelin: another Precision auction might see NS stop at 2S here|pg||
mb|2D|an| |nt|fabsayc: not sure|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: nice 4@S for the NZers here (even 3NT makes)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: and naturally interesting to watch-no play:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: i think so|pg||
nt|tejjyid: NP, these guys are prety quick, I imagine|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: battle of spades and hts, |pg||
nt|barnets: 3N and 4@S both make here|pg||
mb|2H|nt|sybarra: and 4 @H's always "transfers" to 4 @S (for opps) |pg||
nt|cascade: i just checked double dummy and GIB thinks Miller needed to find the @c8 to defeat 3NT|pg||
nt|janm: Defense might get endplayed out of one trick, but 2? Hard to tell. And of course it isn't easy to lead the club Q either, just easier than leading low|pg||
nt|janm: But GIB lets declarer play double dummy too|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EHAA was never this creative|pg||
nt|kaz08833: 9 tricks plaing \s by NS, 8 tricks playing \D by EW|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They stopped in 1NT next door on 6, and that was all they could make as North was declarer|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: 2@s seems a gross under-bid here|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: ooops|pg||
nt|Walddk2: East had an easy diamond lead|pg||
nt|brgpro: this hand is tough for E....2@d is relay and after 2@h...2NT=GF which he doesnt have|pg||
mb|2N|an| |nt|kiwi_joker: they really needed to find out about the nice secondary fit in @Ds to bid this one|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: yes very|pg||
nt|tejjyid: If that tempo reflected the table, I don't think much of it|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: thinking|pg||
mb|p|nt|friggi: should do|pg||
nt|friggi: ??|pg||
nt|sybarra: well indeed that is true!|pg||
nt|rv: it is normally played as Invitational strength 8-9/10 hcp even with 4@s|pg||
nt|gracelin: we see again a GF 2D inquiry.|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|janm: Ah, here we see science in action (not!)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well if 2s is minimum is quite reasonable|pg||
nt|sybarra: I only played it in midnight swisses|pg||
nt|barnets: you put the hex on australia|pg||
nt|rv: interesting contract to play and defend, I expect defense to prevail here|pg||
nt|rodal f: -1 and next? but normal bidding.|pg||
nt|pelu: In my book the N hand is too strong to splinter|pg||
nt|tejjyid: North should KNOW what he is doing over a 4@H cue when he bids 4@D|pg||
nt|h_karluk: USA EDT 00:30, 02:45, 05:00 there will be 16x3=48 boards in 3 rounds, stay with us please, that's a very nice broadcast|pg||
nt|h_karluk: here double could end the auction, easy to overboard after 2@c|pg||
nt|brgpro: but he has to stay with it|pg||
nt|brolucius: So, why play 2NT as GF?|pg||
mb|p|nt|cascade: 2@s will be minimum|pg||
nt|janm: They got to the right spot of course, but does N really know that his partner can't have enough for 7? Make the diamond Q the club Q for instance|pg||
nt|fabsayc: might gain by not helping defense to lead|pg||
nt|cascade: i am pretty sure they dont play 2/1 FG|pg||
nt|fabsayc: remember is precision|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: sorry there is no commentary here|pg||
nt|brgpro: that's the prec style|pg||
mb|3H|an|  |nt|fabsayc: so 2s is definitely limited|pg||
nt|npcjpn: 3@s is not invitational, so pass looks automatic.|pg||
nt|rv: @h ruff or 2@s tricks in addition to 2 tricks each in @hs and @cs|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: yes precision 2@c|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: 11-15|pg||
nt|gracelin: 10 tricks will be made if defenders force declarer to ruff the 3rd club.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Most West's will open 1N in a club-system and east will give GF responds |pg||
nt|brolucius: Not as I used to play it.|pg||
nt|brgpro: 3@d=max with any red short|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: with 5@s and super-max for passed hand, I would have started with 2@h with West hand|pg||
nt|rv: lol|pg||
nt|barnets: as they miss a good game especially on th e bidding|pg||
nt|brgpro: 3@h=asking|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|janm: Even if 2/1 isn't FG, couldn't he at least bid 2@c and then blackwood and tell his partner they had all the keycards and adequate trumps - S would know that AQx of clubs was golden|pg||
nt|rv: commentator's curse as Barnet rightly put it:)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if lead is fourth best, start looking elsewhere|pg||
nt|brolucius: Has he not already shown hearts?|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: fearing Heart ruffs, declarer may still play A, K of trumps to drop the SQ|pg||
nt|h_karluk: would you begin with 1@c?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|rv: can even be 2 down now|pg||
nt|h_karluk: slam is not out of the question from East's pouint of view facing a sound opening bid with long diamonds|pg||
nt|h_karluk: however preferred to stay in 3N|pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: and SOuth does not have enough to bid over a signoff, IMO|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, so he explored further after the 2H response.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: there is no elsewhere but you do look|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that'|pg||
nt|brgpro: 3@s=@d short, thus 3-4-1-5|pg||
nt|brgpro: 3@d=short @s or @d, sorry|pg||
nt|brolucius: 1@C is unattractive with no aces, so fair enough to treat it as a 15-count.|pg||
nt|ritong: no aces is a minus, for sure, but the hand is pretty |pg||
pc|sJ|nt|janm: Of course he doesn't have that, but he could have|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my last Regional event on East Coast I came in 2nd in Masters Pair with one of the Authors of EHAA -- Eric Landau|pg||
nt|h_karluk: not a fairly common treatment in North America|pg||
nt|brolucius: Do they not have a relay to ask how pretty the hand is?|pg||
nt|brgpro: but the 2NT was a bit scary for E, that's why with this hand prec. players will always be in 3NT after 2@c opening ( except they find @s fit)|pg||
nt|brgpro: 3@d=max already|pg||
nt|brolucius: I don't see much benefit in 2NT being forcing, once West has already told partner of his two best suits. That must leave East with no bid to make quite often.|pg||
nt|brgpro: they need to see if pd has 6@c or not, and the 3rd 3 card suit is important as well|pg||
nt|brgpro: so u need to lower ur bids to develop more|pg||
pc|sK|nt|janm: Or a sixth spade|pg||
nt|sybarra: were you playing that system?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|pelu: better J to kill @HK as entry for the 4. @d|pg||
nt|brgpro: 2@c takes a lot of room in the bidding |pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|h_karluk: s true sir|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|c9|nt|pelu: I would never lead @D against 3NT - normal a @H and have @DA as entry or a shot in @S|pg||
nt|h_karluk: no way to get rid of 2 @c losers|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|fabsayc: all true but sometimes no science is better|pg||
nt|rodal f: @H10 drop auto. Can't miss 7 tr.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, I see that it can be useful when East has a strong hand. But quite a price to pay when you have a game-try range.|pg||
nt|brgpro: just over-bid a little. defence is tough too|pg||
nt|brgpro: one trick difference, no big deal|pg||
nt|ritong: :)|pg||
pc|s8|nt|h_karluk: i don't think uncontested 2@c>2D; 2@H consumed space, natural bidders would also come 1@c>1@d;2@h, however 2@s would give better ideas|pg||
pc|s9|nt|henryb:  I think a @h is standout. not that it makes a difference on this hand|pg||
nt|barnets: maybe west should bid 3@S|pg||
nt|barnets: over the X|pg||
nt|rv: NS missed an opportunity to take a @h ruff followed by another @c ruff with @SK to come|pg||
nt|rv: now only 1 down with @HT coming down|pg||
nt|fabsayc: indeed defense is playing hand for declarer|pg||
nt|gracelin: no, but declarer may only lose 2C + 1D|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kaz08833: S might guess /s wrong|pg||
nt|rnmalik: good approach.|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|gracelin: guess 10 tricks too here|pg||
nt|ritong: 1@c 1@d 2@h?|pg||
nt|ritong: hmm|pg||
nt|ritong: forcing to game would be a tad rosy, wouldn t it?|pg||
nt|brgpro: he has 9 tricks already|pg||
mc|9|nt|fabsayc: say defense needs to cash two clubs|pg||
nt|fabsayc: which is equally likely|pg||
nt|gracelin: now I thk declarer will drop SQ and make 11 tricks with two D discards|pg||
nt|h_karluk: oops, now dec wld b able to draw 2 rnds top @s and pitch @c losers|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ditto sir|pg||
nt|h_karluk: cake and walk:)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Particularly as you may have to bid 2@D on such as 10-counts, in case there is a major-suit fit. You then need somewhere to stop if there is no fit and partner does not have a ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: maximum.|pg||

nt|brgpro: hard to tell|pg||
nt|brgpro: 3@C is the only stop after 2@d|pg||
nt|brolucius: In a 5-2 fit. |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: hmmm will other room get to game after West open's strong 1@C?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: partner is a huge favorite for exactly two hearts|pg||
nt|rnmalik: another partial.|pg||
nt|tejjyid: not bad|pg||
nt|xenya: there was a fierce partscore battle in the other room |pg||
nt|gracelin: most clubs are sponsored by business and have 6-8 pros plus other members.  The clubs are closed and not opened to  bridge players in large.|pg||
mb|1H|nt|pelu: 2@D = Multi|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3h is not my choice|pg||
nt|fabsayc: unless specifically agreed as a weak jump|pg||
nt|pelu: agree - bidding direct on Multi sh show a better hand|pg||
nt|brgpro: they hope to have 3@C when bid 2@d:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: I suppose there could be QJ in front of the K and A over it, but I don't think bidding scientifically will make it any easier for them to find that|pg||
nt|cascade: they have another chance to showcase their slam bidding|pg||
nt|pelu: see NSs problem after 4@s|pg||
nt|henryb:  somewhat difficult to get to 6@h-- maybe less difficult when West chooses not to open a large number of spades|pg||
nt|rodal f: Can blame the layout for EW at this board.|pg||
nt|gracelin: Will see another 1C opening to bring NS to 4S|pg||
nt|ritong: close your eyes, roland|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't mind weak with both majors|pg||
nt|gracelin: 2H is a weak opening with both majors, very popular in China,  guess.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: oh yes, i mostly play in Columbia Bridge Play South Carolina USA, when i see member records there is around 600, i cannot tell all are active, it was similar when i was in Turkey|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i believe Liu Jie has invitational values|pg||
mb|1S|nt|pelu: 12-13 tricks on @Dq|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: both directions have hands that fit together beautifully.|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: This time S has a positive response to 1@c|pg||
nt|janm: Can they find diamonds?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H=ART, 9-13 HCP, 4+@S, 0-3@H, maybe longer @C/@D|pg||
nt|kaz08833: its highly likely NS will play 2NT which will go down|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: N must pass surely|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: 3rd bidding box landed on the floor in this session|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hmm, seems interesting 2@h there|pg||
mb|2H|nt|rv: I like 4@s here, max pre-emptive effect and tough for NS to get in|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Looks like each side can make 11 tricks in their best fit|pg||
nt|pelu: here a very popular convention X pd pass if u have the suit - In my opinion the convention dont work well - u can never X for penalty if u have a good penalty pd|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: whimp|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: oops|pg||
nt|jcwla: Uh oh.|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2NT forcing may be a playable method, but I had never heard of it before.|pg||
nt|brgpro: if N decides to rebid 2@h then it is tough to reach game|pg||
nt|brgpro: not knowing the super @c fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: Or is 6@c okay too?|pg||
nt|cascade: do they need to|pg||
nt|henryb:  North MUST bid here; pass is not acceptable with that good a hand and heart support|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=ART, 5+@D|pg||
nt|barnets: not best|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: rescued|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i predict 4@s|pg||
nt|gracelin: with equal length in the majors, Fu chose t declarer the hand himself, an unlucky decision here.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@D usually 2/3@D but ....|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@h = 4+ HCP|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Moysian fit but|pg||
nt|ritong: although mini flannery does not seem to optimize this board|pg||
nt|xenya: seems a wheel has come off|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: oh oh |pg||
nt|sybarra: but can W lead a @D easily|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 6c is better|pg||
nt|pelu: ok a bidding: 4@s P P 4NT - then 5@C (or 6@C) by N and 5/6@D by S = 2 siuter in red|pg||
nt|sybarra: may not be best spot|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Newell had option to bid 3@C showing MAX with longer @C|pg||
nt|barnets: Q|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|rv: South's action is surely too timid though it is hardly clearcut to bid at 5 level|pg||
nt|barnets: would show  the @HA|pg||
nt|brgpro: tough game to reach anyways, but will make 4|pg||
nt|h_karluk: :)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|cascade: anyway the answer was yes easily|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 6@D likely down if diamonds 4-1|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 6@C would still have chances|pg||
nt|kaz08833: with other Q N shd pass it's unfortunate judge by N|pg||
nt|rodal f: Auto @S hook and a 50% @D hook for 10in @S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: perhaps but they have bid my multi suit a few times, and i am still spending the winnings|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 15% probabilty 5-1 break|pg||
pc|d9|nt|kiwibridge: the slam was NOT found so 13 well earned imps to CT|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: I kinda blame Stout a bit here .. he has chance to bid 3@C, which would have pushed pd's buttons (and they would never defend 5@Dx then)|pg||
nt|rv: I would pass 2@s with West hand, no Invite with 7 hcp, bid game only if partner super-accepts|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i was wondering how that 3@H bid would backfire|pg||
nt|pelu: in US and ? canada - the defense against Multi is not so commen as in Europe|pg||
nt|brolucius: Very tough and perhaps the game is not quite so good as it looks, despite the minor suit wonder-fit.|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and what after 2@c rebid? should S make next move? to 3@c, for example.|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|sybarra: might see china gain some imps here|pg||
nt|tejjyid: slams all make with @S Qx in North|pg||
nt|jcwla: You might say...|pg||
nt|brgpro: possible 5 if N plays a @s now|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 2@c rebid would be nice|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sybarra: with the opening bid,  not easily |pg||
nt|ahollan1: that brings up point of extreme trivia - i was given URL that explains origin of "schneid"  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20061024124644AA8yaYF|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 3-3 36%. 4-2 48 %|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|janm: I assume all of this was natural after 1@c and 1@d, and 3@s is some sort of attempt to find NT|pg||
nt|janm: 6NT won't be a success|pg||
nt|henryb:  Would North's pass be forcing? I do not think so. And North could have much less, say AKJxxx in clubs and out|pg||
nt|fabsayc: where do we locate BBO|pg||
nt|pelu: :)|pg||
nt|xenya: what was 2@S, Jack? |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|fabsayc: oh is this blackwood|pg||
nt|rodal f: At the -edge for W but...|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|janm: Surely if N jumps to 6@c, S should let him play there |pg||
nt|fabsayc: i would have bid 4@C over 3nt|pg||
nt|janm: I think 4NT is just a quantitative slam try, not Blackwood|pg||
nt|fabsayc: club queen has to be a big card|pg||
nt|cascade: south did well to move with no aces|pg||
nt|janm: Yes, but S seems to be thinking along NT lines, also if he bid 4@c wouldn't that make it sound as if 3@s was a cue bid?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Took it out.|pg||
nt|rv: West should surely pass 3@s after his invite|pg||
nt|jcwla: Always max pressure from the Indonesian pair -- no free space -- a winning style.|pg||
pc|h4|nt|barnets: well done|pg||
nt|pelu: for sure Herr exp a better hand by partner|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i have to fight everytime to play it live, mostly recently last weekend|pg||
nt|tejjyid: if theat 4 HCP is 2 Q's, East can stop here|pg||
nt|brgpro: after 2@c S will surely bid 3@c, then it is up to N to choose 3@h or 3@s, although i think the later is more likely|pg||
pc|h3|nt|fabsayc: i liked the unscientific auction better|pg||
nt|janm: Of course, N has a minimum and a void in partner's suit, so even with that nice 6-card suit and 3 aces, it's not unreasonable for him to pass|pg||
nt|pelu: here in denmark even "the old ladies" play Multi :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the final ruling was the event strength of the weakest team was over 8000 master points so multi allowable|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i swear this is true|pg||
nt|fabsayc: as opposed to my usual embellishments|pg||
nt|pelu: I trust u - and here we find that atitude vert strange (mild expression :))|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: big think and sigh|pg||
nt|h_karluk: likely pass or pull?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: simple and natural, keeps options open|pg||
pc|h9|nt|cascade: Stout does have spade stoppers but the @sAK and the rest of his hand are also suitable for slam|pg||
nt|janm: This one wasn't really very scientific either :)|pg||
nt|rv: he has bid his hand to the hilt by showing 5@s and 8-9 hcp|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 4NT quantative, I assume, so Nunn can cue@C |pg||
nt|h_karluk: only a favorable placed K is @h, rest offside|pg||
nt|brolucius: Sveta makes a good point. Perhaps a 2@C rebid is better than 2@H when you have @SK-x-x and there may well be a fit there.|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: wants to lead @h|pg||
pc|d3|nt|vugraphzkt: changes mind|pg||
pc|d6|nt|gracelin: won't take long to bring home 10 tricks|pg||
nt|brgpro: i would pass 2@h|pg||
nt|ritong: according to patrick, it was just hand hogging|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so EW will usually remain silent|pg||
nt|gracelin: Fu doesn't know which suit is longer in Jin's hand.  He could either pass 2H or to play 2S, I tk he chose 2S also because his hand may want to compete to 3h if opponent balance.|pg||
pc|dA|pc|h5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: final scores for Round Robin  1 are posted -- http://www.nzbridgecongress.co.nz/pabf2010/Openxtab.html|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: trying to work out p's hand !|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: screen down !|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: paper discussion|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: screen up away we go|pg||
nt|jcwla: So one in each side suit and one of Rodal's coffee break boards.|pg||
nt|brgpro: but, dont u think 2@h is the most proper bid from N?|pg||
pc|c5|nt|pelu: I exp that @s are trump (4@c = cue bid with @s)|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cA|nt|rodal f: By non vul u are so right RV. At vul I would bid 4 100 by 100 times after 3@S from pard|pg||
nt|rv: he can make this contract if he guesses everything correctly though|pg||
nt|rodal f: 2NT might a bit hard from Brison, but his pards problem.|pg||
nt|rv: needs to avoid double finesse in @s which he has successfully negotiated, next needs to play @cs twice towards dummy and then guess @d diamonds as well|pg||
nt|tejjyid: hmmph|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|janm: This is actually probably a hand that would be easier to bid in a natural system - N would start with 1@c and later be able to show a good hand.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: China began RR2 in 4th, NZ 7th|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Grant-Ker did get to 4@H on previous hand|pg||
nt|pelu: but the 5@d bid I have no expl - even a guees|pg||
nt|brgpro: i would have done the same|pg||
pc|h7|nt|barnets: intersting on a diamond lead|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|cascade: well they get to a similar situation after 1@c 1@h; 2@d 3@d ...|pg||
nt|janm: So making 5 or 6 depending on whether they cash the heart A now|pg||
nt|henryb:  in which case South might go down at the five level when the opponents were down in 4@s|pg||
nt|rv: well defended, still could be a loss since 5@d makes for NS|pg||
nt|barnets: to see if dc could make it|pg||
nt|h_karluk: haha|pg||
pc|hA|nt|tejjyid: I canot fathom 5@D - 0 Aces in 1430?|pg||
nt|ritong: i am not convinced north should bid over 3@c|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|janm: Somewhat similar I suppose, but the S hand would have shown a better hand at that point and N could then bid 3@s to pattern out. I don't know, I just hear comments about how much ...|pg||
nt|janm: easier some hand would be in a strong club system so often, I can't resist when it doesn't help at all and might even hurt|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|fabsayc: could not afford this line|pg||
nt|fabsayc: now spade 8 setting trick|pg||
nt|pelu: well played - but the informativ X help|pg||
nt|fabsayc: needed to cross ruff to shorten his trumps|pg||
nt|pelu: no setting trick, @C ruff (@s3), @D to King, @C-ruff @DA and @D last trick on @SJ|pg||
pc|h8|nt|fabsayc: of your right he still has time|pg||
nt|xenya: does that mean that N had to correct to 3@H?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Looks like 2@C is better. You have already shown 5 hearts, of course.|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dT|pg||
nt|h_karluk: not really|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|pelu: spec - help us - u are total silent :)|pg||
pc|c7|nt|gracelin: no, north has shown both majors with the 2H opening.  South picks the trums.|pg||
nt|gracelin: trumps|pg||
nt|xenya: right, thanks|pg||
nt|gracelin: now a trump will squeeze south who must abandon his H, then either minor can end-play declarer for -2|pg||
pc|c9|nt|tejjyid: Why 4N would be BW tho, I can't imagine|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sybarra: and I am sure E would like to have said X agter the hand however that could backfire |pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: hmmmm|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i do not see any damage to rebid 2@c|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|pelu: no the help came: 5@D = 0 Aaces - 4NT = 1430|pg||
pc|cK|nt|tejjyid: 5@H asking for @S Q|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|cT|nt|sybarra: need a mirror to know pard has q of @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: scrambled 6 tricks|pg||
pc|sT|nt|jcwla: Meanwhile, Asbi made the 5@C on 21 where Liu went down 2 -- 13 more to the leaders.|pg||
pc|c8|pc|d5|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s7|pc|s3|pc|sA|pg||

pc|sK|pc|dJ|pc|s9|pc|dK|pg||
nt|h_karluk: esp w void @d|pg||
nt|brolucius: The usual rule on 6-4 hands is to rebid the long suit when minimum. Perhaps the three-card spade fit alters that. Interesting.|pg||

nt|janm: The reason I think the strong club might hurt on this hand is more psychological than real - N starts out thinking he has a minimum and doesn't revise that idea|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the vague 3s and 4nt did them in|pg||
nt|janm: Another void opposite partner's long Major!|pg||
nt|cascade: he is minimum until he finds a fit|pg||
nt|cascade: then he has a very slam suitable hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: My guess is N/S feel good about their game, but not as good as it  will score up |pg||
nt|rodal f: So after the board: That was not as I would have done it. If E goes dow. And WD if home:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: internet connection a bit slow here|pg||

nt|brgpro: but the suit quality is much different, |pg||
nt|brgpro: playing in part score, u like to be in the best suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: on @d lead, declarer pitches a @h, draws a round of trumps and plays a @c out|pg||

nt|h_karluk: *cash-out|pg||
pc|cA|nt|janm: I think we had a discussion in another match about rebidding 2@h vs 2@c on hands like N's - what do you both think (you know what I think)|pg||

nt|jcwla: This can't be the right M.O.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: reopening needed|pg||
nt|gracelin: north chose to double in other room, so south had an easy 4H bid.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i liked that 2@d|pg||
nt|h_karluk: tho passed hand|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 10 HCP, shortage in opener suit but showed his source of tricks|pg||
nt|gracelin: agree, but may not help to reach 4H with the 2D response.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: also true|pg||
nt|gracelin: north might play south for fifth Heart, since north has denied 4H when he bid 2D.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: anyways 3@h good decision|pg||
nt|gracelin: Good decision is to reach 4H :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and i doubt most would bid 2N, i guess even 3@c would be a minority vote|pg||
nt|h_karluk: just 7 hcp on vul vs nonvul and gives much info to opps|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|henryb:  apparently E-W play a variable NT; weak nv and sound(er) vul|pg||
nt|babs59: Hi.  Please don't jinx them Barnet|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Stout will be waiting for his heart ruff at trick 2.   Bad news, Graeme  :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: Another steal. East shud double the 1NT opening to get in.  |pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, but the most important aim is to get to any game that may be playable. On that North hand there is a good chance that 4@S will be there if partner has five spades.|pg||
nt|brgpro: can easily be 7@s!|pg||
pc|s3|nt|rodal f: 10 and next|pg||
nt|pelu: 5 tricks in 1@H - so not so bad|pg||
nt|tejjyid: time for a quick coffee. On that lead, this will make buckets|pg||
pc|sK|nt|cascade: NZ gained another 11 IMPs on  5 when Grant Ker found a good 4@s dive which went undoubled!!!|pg||

nt|kaz08833: NS only have to take 6 tricks or even 7 because EW can make 4@s|pg||
pc|s6|nt|sybarra: and a std. @S lead |pg||
nt|fabsayc: depends a lot on spots, here i totally agree with 2@H rebid|pg||
nt|pelu: yes 11-14 and 15-17|pg||
nt|pelu: good Acol-style|pg||
nt|rv: wlc Barbara, as neutrals we would like a much closer match:)|pg||
nt|babs59: I don't claim neutral status when Peter's playing :)|pg||
nt|jaheim: t|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|cascade: well i dont know what you think|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Sartaj may ruff this and run 10@S|pg||
nt|jcwla: If you're willing to go there later, go there now with 2@S over 2@D.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sybarra: any reasone to cover? |pg||
nt|rodal f: By RV if u have to leave|pg||
nt|rv: Hi Rodal and specs, need to leave now, enjoy the game|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sad|pg||
nt|pelu: 500/430|pg||
nt|fabsayc: kind of like paying to see the hidden cards in poker|pg||
nt|gracelin: East was very serious with West's unf Vul. 2-over 1 overcall. but yes, 2NT had little to do with his hand.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: :)|pg||
pc|d6|nt|vugraphzkt: brief flurry of action|pg||
pc|c4|nt|cascade: but i typically bid the six card suit unless there is a major disparity in the suit strength|pg||
nt|fabsayc: actually defense could slip and allow down 1|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|h3|nt|sybarra: n/s system should not be tried for novices....  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: and isn't even almost allowed in ACBL|pg||
nt|sybarra: and I do not know a defense to it|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe defense is just bid your longest suit |pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: Hou is examining the system card|pg||
nt|sybarra: but the "down unders"  (Aus and NZ) have always been "creative"  |pg||
nt|pelu: yes - not my style - but on the other hand - I dont like to see a long relay-bidding by opp|pg||
pc|hA|nt|rv: this should get beaten|pg||
nt|babs59: of course, I've just noticed his name showing as Paul Gill, but it's Peter Gill, and he's my brother|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, a very dangerous opening|pg||
pc|h7|nt|sybarra: probably thinking S lead from kxxx|pg||
nt|barnets: maybe he should duck the @D|pg||
nt|barnets: another @D|pg||
nt|barnets: knocks out the ace|pg||
nt|rv: yes that would be a good deceptive play especially at trick 1|pg||
nt|barnets: and if east plays a third @D dec is home|pg||
nt|barnets: and in the newspaper too|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|cascade: Michael Lawrence had some advice for 6=4s which i read many years ago|pg||
nt|janm: I think it's automatic to rebid the 6 card major with a relatively weak hand, but I've been told that's old fashioned :). Glad to hear some support|pg||
nt|jcwla: E/W quietly cede the lead here.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: for sure on another layout there might be a problem, however i know no pain no gain:)|pg||
pc|s7|nt|henryb:  Not the Acol I know. that is weak throughout|pg||
nt|rv: has a very good chance of working especially if West returns @D3 which may be difficult to read|pg||
nt|h_karluk: if you are committed to lose there would be gazillions excuses|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|sybarra: welcome to Pat Anderson, USA|pg||
nt|fifee: ty Shirley :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not enough trumps to take the rest|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sybarra: maybe down under= upside down  |pg||
nt|gracelin: NS will even make this|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ahollan1: does that mean in NZ i'd be a morning person?|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|nt|cascade: his advice was with 6=4 rebid the suit with the most high card points|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe |pg||
nt|babs59: board 7 where Gill and Gosney missed game, OR  West opened 1S and passed partner's 1NT response (surely forcing?)|pg||
nt|babs59: so it was a flat board|pg||
nt|rv: declarer should have possibly cashed 4@cs instead of playing 3rd @d|pg||
nt|rv: that would have forced West to make 2 pitches and he might have got it wrong|pg||
nt|rodal f: If any are long at @H it's W. Play @H for the Q|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|jcwla: But this has been their style throughout -- "maybe if we wish and hope and pray it might come true" -- that Indonesia will stay out -- but they don't, so get where you're going ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: asap.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: perish the thought|pg||
pc|s4|nt|vugraphzkt: got em|pg||
pc|s8|nt|sybarra: or an all night person?|pg||
nt|rv: now if North cashes 4@s, West will be in some discomfort|pg||
nt|rv: 4@cs|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|fabsayc: here lau might have thought of not covering|pg||
nt|gracelin: that's 13 fat imps|pg||
mc|10|nt|ritong: a kind of masterminding  " they are at fav, maybe they have a good sacrifice, let s go"|pg||
nt|h_karluk: interesting X by N|pg||
nt|brgpro: he was afraid of a nonvul. 5@d save...but comparing the risk of losing 6 or 7@s...i dont think 4@h is the right opening bid, even as practice...|pg||

nt|vugraphzkt: yes pass|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They are 2 there Patrick, so they are fine|pg||
nt|gracelin: got it.|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: 11 tricks in @h/@d for EW - 5@C would be expensive for NS|pg||
nt|gracelin: south hand is a classic Precision 2C opening, either 6+C, or 5+C plus a 4+ major.|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|janm: Thanks, Alister :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: A contract wich is easy to fail at for EW|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i predict will be expensive|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: need to stay low here |pg||
mb|1S|nt|sybarra: eveything off  |pg||

mb|p|nt|friggi: yes|pg||
nt|fabsayc: only 10 if lau had not covered|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: thank you|pg||
nt|rodal f: Or kill the cat for a safe score|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I like the aggressive reverse|pg||
nt|pelu: not so bad 6@c - u just need @cs 2-2 or singleton Q|pg||
nt|pelu: yes no problem for me - @sK better now and 4½ loser|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I agree the 6-4 is worth an extra K & the @SK is worth an extra Q - so I call this a 19 |pg||
mb|2S|nt|fifee: @S lead is a killer|pg||
nt|janm: Would you bid again as N?|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok 2 nt is some minor bid,  Al,  need your help |pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: http://www.nzbridgecongress.co.nz/pabf2010/Openxtab.html  for standings after 12 of the 13 rounds in RR1|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hi all|pg||
nt|sybarra: did it mean specially wk @D's?|pg||
nt|sybarra: *specifically |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 25 starts with Precision 2@C on previous board -- it gets scary from there|pg||
nt|jcwla: 22 and 23 pushes in 2@S making 3 and 3NT making 4, respectively.|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: how does this tourney work ?|pg||
nt|itinerant: 2S = 4+clubs, 5+ spades|pg||
nt|gracelin: NS can take 18 tricks in NT, s guess they will also reach 7NT.|pg||
mb|p|nt|alchilds: no low =2|pg||
nt|pelu: u owe me a coke, Martin :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: closed room EW made a wise stop at 3S, Club ruff beats 4S.  Same here.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: against 2@s what would be best lead|pg||
nt|ritong: @d|pg||
pc|h9|nt|friggi: agree|pg||
nt|janm: He knows he probably has the best hand at the table, but that doesn't necessarily translate into the ability to take 8 tricks|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not 2@D|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Amanda, Henry, Peter|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yes @D preempt|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: swing both ways on 19 4 more CT|pg||
nt|fabsayc: you did not accept|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: tight match so far|pg||
nt|h_karluk: interesting 4@h, the question how to reach|pg||
nt|gracelin: provided there is no accident|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Indeed, you need to be very unlucky to go down in 7NT, but it is possible on certain layouts|pg||
nt|brolucius: West should always raise with four spades, even if game is very unlikely opposite a passed hand. No point in allowing the defenders in at the 1@S level.|pg||
nt|ritong: leading a doubleton with a potential trump trick is not appealing|pg||
pc|hK|nt|janm: Well, he pushed them one higher, so I guess he was right|pg||
nt|fabsayc: maybe double|pg||
nt|barnets: do the top 8 play off or top 4?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: you can guess I play few partscores|pg||
pc|h7|nt|janm: But DBL should surely suggest some club length, shouldn't it?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2d suggests better diamonds|pg||
nt|fabsayc: double allows for 1nt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D/@H are Transfer Preempts -- only 3@C is nat pre|pg||
nt|babs59: Paul Gosney has also qualified for the Australian Under 26 team - which meant that for NZ PABF he has been replaced in the team|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|janm: True, but I'm afraid the doubleton club would keep me from doubling - I think I'd end up being a chicken and passing - maybe bid 1NT?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 21 it was|pg||
nt|davidstern: They may have right sided this to avoid a heart lead|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 14 HCP, worths|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ahollan1: on 25  China in 4@C|pg||
nt|sybarra: glaned at conv. cards, and were more than I could deal with at this time of night |pg||
nt|sybarra: *glanced|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i've been studying newell-reid system for a while in preparation of this PABF|pg||
nt|brgpro: the more N bids his @h, the less interested S is|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, Hearts 4-2 and clubs 5-1.|pg||
nt|ritong: here it works like a charm, though|pg||
pc|s4|nt|babs59: but he will be representing Australia in the World Youth Series in Philadelphia in October|pg||
nt|davidstern: So 9 top tricks now 1-1-2-5|pg||
nt|jcwla: It panned out.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|pelu: EW play Low as come on (and even)|pg||
nt|henryb:  Roland!|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: sorry all we went down for a moment|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If you go down in 7NT with these cards, you should apply for membership of the VUPW|pg||
nt|h_karluk: :)|pg||
nt|brgpro: if N bids 4@C now, maybe but after 4@d i think the chance they will miss this grand is big|pg||
nt|gracelin: what's that, Rland? U want to apply .|pg||
nt|xenya: PW?|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Al |pg||
nt|barnets: i am told its a double round robin|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but since i dont drink coke, is ok|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I guess the lackof@C Q hurt them|pg||
nt|gracelin: I|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Very Unlucky Players Worldwide|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|nt|janm: However, pushing the opponents up a level was certainly a good thing, because it looks as if 2@s will be very difficult to make|pg||
nt|fabsayc: partner will only bid clubs with 5, then the support is adequate|pg||
nt|barnets: tks |pg||
nt|barnets: nick|pg||
nt|babs59: I understand that this year it's a double RR and then the leading team wins|pg||
pc|hA|nt|h_karluk: please wake me up when the high-tower auction ends :)|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|gracelin: both East and West are looking at their dangerous club holding to stop at the safe 3S.  Good decision.|pg||
pc|h5|nt|janm: Your partner, maybe :)|pg||
nt|pelu: 232 VP - 223 - 218|pg||
nt|kaz08833: now 11 tricks|pg||
nt|gracelin: Then I withdraw my application.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We are 28 million members|pg||
pc|hT|nt|fabsayc: get a new partner jan :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if i had say 2524 i would rebid 2c|pg||
nt|janm: Once upon a time, I doubled 1@d with 4441 (in that order). My partner waited until the 4 level to bid his 4 card club suit!! Taught me :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so i think here double suggests some diamond length|pg||
nt|janm: I would be more likely to DBL with 2524, and certainly with 1534, but I think you're convincing me to bid 1NT|pg||
nt|rv: Official tourney url is http://www.pabf2010.co.nz/|pg||
nt|jcwla: Surprising pass -- that dummy is just so trick-taking in @D's on this auction.|pg||
pc|s6|nt|davidstern: 10 now|pg||
nt|davidstern: 2-1-2-5|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 6 level needed to play a slam? |pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|nt|friggi: not the best line:)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: over reverses Iplay Blackout (o a variety) so I Can set @C with 3@C imediately|pg||
nt|tejjyid: no space filing 3@D bids|pg||
pc|c2|nt|pelu: I would bid 6 on the East hand - and make 6@c on an endplay on S :):)|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|fifee: great defense though|pg||
nt|brolucius: South would not lead the 9 from @H9-x-x, so North could read the lead as a likely doubleton, holding up her @HA  so that it would be an entry on the second round.|pg||
pc|c8|nt|henryb:  You cant take enough ruffs, so might as well play the @hQ|pg||
nt|henryb:  Indonesia currently 2nd, Chinese Taipei first|pg||
nt|babs59: however in other years this is the Zonal selection event for the Bermuda Bowl (and Venice Cup / Seniors) - in which case there are SF and Finals|pg||

nt|fifee: down 2 now|pg||
nt|tejjyid: East has doneenough bidding|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s9|nt|janm: Best now is for N to lead a club and get his ruff |pg||
nt|cascade: but a diamond works too|pg||
nt|cascade: since declarer also needs to ruff a club|pg||
nt|janm: Interesting that a diamond will have the same good effect as the club ruff|pg||
pc|sA|nt|babs59: the Pacific Asia Bridge Federation is Zone 6|pg||

nt|brolucius: When you have to guess whether the lead is a singleton or a doubleton (and therefore whether you should hold up your ace), it is usually better to play it as a singleton. Firstly, ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: because partner is more likely to lead a singleton than a doubleton, secondly because if you hold up declarer may be able to draw trumps anyway.|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|friggi: should be easy to reach|pg||
nt|cascade: but NZers like to preempt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=11-15 HCP, 3+@D|pg||

nt|fabsayc: oh, i thought he passed|pg||
nt|brgpro: of course W wont find @h lead i mean|pg||
mb|p|nt|cascade: 5-4-2-2 equal minimum - you have to have some standards|pg||
nt|henryb:  although 2@s would certainly work out just fine as a contract|pg||
nt|pelu: @c-lead - normal here - dont work - there are 5 @S-tricks|pg||
mb|1N|nt|cascade: that is what is commonly played|pg||
nt|cascade: 3@c/@d = minimums|pg||
nt|janm: Now is 3@s forcing?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not to me|pg||
nt|cascade: and 3@h/@s = maximums with @c/@d respectively|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but then i dont open this crap|pg||
nt|cascade: lets hope not and they have discussed it|pg||
nt|janm: So Miller has shown a minimum, will he decide it's good enough to raise if 3@s isn't forcing?|pg||
nt|cascade: he does have an ace and a fit|pg||
nt|babs59: I have a suspicion that both Zone 6 and Zone 7 will use it for selection purposes for the World Championships|pg||
nt|gracelin: south may not be finished yet.|pg||
nt|brgpro: so he has a good chance of making this|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: oops operator |pg||
nt|pelu: now Liu would have prefer to bid 2@s first time - but that risk pass round - do he had to X first|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: he did think|pg||
nt|brgpro: i would bid 1@s...treat this hand as 8+|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|vugraphzkt: sorry a bit sleepy after lunch :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: interesting @s7|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, indeed, so I also bet Fu to make this|pg||
nt|h_karluk: most people prefer 3rd or 4th|pg||
nt|brgpro: 2nd 4th|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  chance for shift|pg||
nt|gracelin: Fu gives East a chance to shift to the damaging Heart|pg||
nt|brgpro: std lead against NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: Probably N could have bid 3@s over 2@h to invite in spades, so maybe this should be forcing|pg||
nt|sybarra: I know I do not play their system since that is not a neg X for m |pg||
nt|sybarra: for mi|pg||
nt|rv: Double of 2@c by West is t/o and need not have extras|pg||
nt|pelu: 480|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|sybarra: need some coffee or tea |pg||
nt|janm: The 2@h bid did keep EW from getting to too many hearts :)|pg||
nt|cascade: there are lots of ways to bid spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Shirley -- you mean Hou's DBL?|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes I would not X with that hand |pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, indeed. Takes the pressure off the subsequent bidding.|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: many experts play this treatment below 2M level after 1M-1N-(2X by opps)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: generally, of course, thinking is a good idea|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ambitious X|pg||
nt|jcwla: Seems like W had given full voice to hand already.|pg||
nt|gracelin: Obviously, west cannot double 3S for T/O, which East will pass.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: umm, interchange NS hands and join the party|pg||
nt|ritong: difficult, after the overcall|pg||
nt|brgpro: he is thinking of passing or 3@d...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: pass obv|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: (or a beer) |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: negative dbl with 4+@H -- what's wrong with that?|pg||
nt|rv: double above 2M level on 1M-1N-(2/3X by opps) is still t/o with extras (15+)|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: There are about 8 rounds left; it all finishes on Sunday afternoon (NZ time)|pg||
nt|pzpp: another successful contract is 3NT on board 26, with 3 overtricks:)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: yep-overlooked.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: or rather that was being played at the time of my observation:)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: the problem is @dA on the air|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Second from a bad 4-card suit|pg||
nt|h_karluk: remember, 4th seat|pg||
nt|brgpro: since pd didnt break the transfer, he doesnt see a good game. however, pd may not break it with Kxx or Axx|pg||
nt|brgpro: with that holding game will be very playable|pg||
pc|c2|nt|cascade: Lau was undeterred by the hearts sitting over him|pg||
nt|janm: Now, can he make this? Or rather, will he? I'm sure he can double dummy|pg||
nt|jcwla: The one thing they didn't want to do was give up 450 - so instead 500.|pg||
nt|ritong: i think stayman then 2@s invitational with 5+@ss any shape is a good treatment|pg||
nt|brgpro: so passing looks a very conservative view to me|pg||
nt|brolucius: Obvious game-try when we were suggesting starting with a positive response. |pg||
pc|cT|nt|pelu: in OR - where NZ has a very strange system - they never found the @s-suit and they sold out to 5@c - NO X in board 10|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 1@H showed spades i believe|pg||
nt|fabsayc: on board 10 open room|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: that was helpful|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I can understand Hou Xu's double. He thinks the defence has a club ruff on this auction|pg||
nt|jcwla: 1NT over the double would generally show another high card.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They have not, but North has a natural club trick|pg||
nt|Walddk2: heart trick rather|pg||
nt|gracelin: south hoped the defender could cross ruff in the minors, he didn't expect EW bid to 4C on 3-3 fit.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: k|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|Walddk2: Would lead fourth with an honour higher than the 10|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer is now home with a later spade finesse|pg||
nt|h_karluk: cover @dK:)|pg||
nt|brgpro: so 11 back...looks like a pinpang game:)|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|brgpro: one for you, one for me...|pg||
pc|cK|nt|janm: Or maybe he can't if E puts the diamond K up on a lead towards dummy |pg||
nt|cascade: i think he has to lose at least one trick in each suit|pg||
nt|sybarra: first off, it is only a 7 count,  pard never knows I have 5 hts.  and never knows to bid them |pg||
nt|rv: North should have surely competed to 3@c|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr. As a spec told me 1-4     4-1=28.3%|pg||
pc|c9|nt|fabsayc: the problem was they had no idea whose hand it was|pg||
nt|fabsayc: a common problem when you open very light|pg||
nt|jcwla: One of reasons for 2@C to discourage pd as much as poss'l, give them room to say their peace and be done.|pg||
pc|h5|nt|friggi: do you agree?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can handle any minor suit rebid from partner too|pg||
nt|h_karluk: oh thanks Wang|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|gracelin: but Hengsha leads most of the time.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The Chinese are very good at ping-pong, aka table tennis|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Although it must have been a shock that the women lost in the WC final|pg||
nt|brgpro: they lost to other chinese girls|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i was 2nd at pingong when i was in lycee, and one day i saw a chinese trainer video, that day i quit:) omg it was amazing|pg||
nt|h_karluk: in practice West expected to play low with a poker face|pg||
nt|gracelin: Jack, tell Fu overtricks do not affect imps on this one and claim.|pg||
nt|brgpro: i will text message him!|pg||
nt|brgpro: but he is not on tank, W is!|pg||
nt|gracelin: he can claim 9 tricks if he knows diamonds break.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|janm: Of course N doesn't know he has spade losers, so is just trying to lose a trick in each side suit and ruff the second club loser|pg||
nt|pelu: playing with screens I dont see that there were a "Break Of Tempo)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|brgpro: but @d are rated to break|pg||
pc|dA|nt|cascade: Chan can Grosvenor now with the @s7|pg||
nt|pelu: EW signals: HL = odd Number|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree with that |pg||
nt|h_karluk: @s or @h?|pg||
nt|brgpro: claim time i think|pg||
nt|gracelin: West took 4 minutes to duck this.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: say shifted a @h then overtake @d A must|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|sybarra: declarer knows well that the club was singleton |pg||
nt|rv: North-South pair not very experienced and probably over-awed by occasion|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Bd 24 very costly to NZ - the dreaded double game swing, when NZ allowed Aus to play in 5C in the other room ..14 IMPs out|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The China table tennis women lost to Singapore represented by Chinese players who have been regarded by the then national team coach as not good enough to play for China. He seemed ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: to have got that wrong :)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|friggi: has to play E for @DK|pg||
nt|alchilds: right pay |pg||
nt|h_karluk: i dont think West draw the big picture, to me auction shouting abt the inferences|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|pc|d6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'd hate to pass|pg||
nt|Walddk2: @S9 to ask for a diamond return (Lavinthal's suit preference signal)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: well, maybe frequency of success 4th position is much more important than the size of a swing|pg||
nt|ritong: not sure with the possible 1@s positive response, but after all, could be 6 elegant/7|pg||
pc|h9|nt|Walddk2: But he did not get it|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|nt|tejjyid: with screens, probbaly not|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|janm: Now for the bad news|pg||
pc|c5|nt|gracelin: north ignores partner's S9 signal.  Showing no confidence to partner. |pg||
pc|cJ|nt|pelu: here the 2@H opening = 6 card suit or good 5 card suit|pg||
nt|ritong: for inviting|pg||
pc|s5|nt|rodal f: If u like % and odds for hook by the %: http://www.bridgehands.com/P/Probability_of_Card_Distribution.htm Bookmark this site.|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|sybarra: prefer playing neg free's here, but few folks do....that means under 8/9|pg||
nt|ahollan1: china in trouble again -- on previous hand where 4@H was down 1 --  China in 5@H|pg||
nt|ritong: via stayman|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dT|nt|h_karluk: allright, push next board please|pg||
pc|s4|nt|brolucius: What is 4th position to do with it, when the opening is a strong 1@S?|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|janm: Those of us who wouldn't have opened 2@h with the S hand can now explain that it would have prevented our side from going down in 4@s|pg||
nt|sybarra: and I will say,  I do not strongly object to the neg X,  with single spade,  and the minor holdings   (just dont like the point count )|pg||
nt|ahollan1: get shape across -- let partner worry about points :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: Newell has 7@H on table as major pen card|pg||
nt|sybarra: ty Amanda|pg||
nt|sybarra: so does that help declarer?  not sure |pg||
pc|c7|nt|ritong: nothing|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: does anybody see a 9th trick?|pg||
pc|s8|nt|brgpro: but the chinese girls are all teenagers, need some experiences, so losing the would cup is not a bad thing at all|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i do not recommend to watch pairs ping-pong exercise, keep your eyes relaxed :)|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @s?|pg||
nt|brolucius: 1@C, I mean.|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dJ|pc|sA|nt|h_karluk: i disagree with X and the contract was a makeable one|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can endplay north for 8  or cash @SQ for 8 |pg||
nt|ahollan1: oooo can't endplay North anymore|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s3|pc|sQ|nt|brgpro: even in 3NT, QJ98x is very playable opposite Kx or Ax, as long as @dA will not be knocked out early|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so it's is 8|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ahollan1: whodda thunk|pg||
pc|c8|pc|h3|pc|hJ|pg||

nt|rodal f: @H at top.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: still all smiling|pg||
nt|rnmalik: They dont have any choice:)|pg||
nt|pzpp: EW has a @h game here, but on a non @d lead, they have 13 tricks|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I can spel, I just can't type|pg||
nt|Walddk2: How?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Must you not always lose 1 heart, 1 diamond and 2 clubs?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: play a @d to table|pg||
nt|brgpro: NS can make 6@h but i dont think anyone will bid it|pg||
nt|brolucius: To overbid would be (perhaps) to force to game. To make a game-try is to bid down the middle.|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: DBL or 1@h with the N hand?|pg||
nt|barnets: 6-8 weeks from end feb|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the ill bid and fated 3N brings a welcom 7 to Japan|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the north hand on 11 could justify since attempt to deceive, as with a 2nt response|pg||
nt|jcwla: The @S ruff went bye bye - meanwhile 24 a push at 4@SX making.|pg||
nt|ritong: visibly you do not like my stayman gimmick  pity:)|pg||
mb|1D|nt|janm: I'm a 1@h bidder, but I can see the appeal of DBL|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=ART, STR, F1, (good 13)14+ HCP unbal, 15+ HCP BAL [16+ BAL unfav]|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: yes there are screens and was not a long think|pg||
nt|jcwla: 31 straight for the leaders.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: its the nebulous 1 @D in the precision system |pg||
nt|cascade: me too|pg||
nt|barnets: sorry|pg||
nt|babs59: np :)|pg||
nt|rv: some form of Bergen raise by Peter here?|pg||
nt|babs59: yes|pg||
nt|npcjpn: pass, double or 2@c?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: agree-@D lead difficult but not impossible.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 26 hc, rare but elegant @h slam|pg||
nt|brgpro: i meant, i think they play 14-16 NT, thus, rebid of 1NT=17-19|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: P=0-9 or less than 3 controls|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 2@c+1@d, oh sorry, North's @h J9xx|pg||
nt|gracelin: so the 800 in other room are not a real disaster.|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: I'd think Miller would want to bid 2@h to keep West from an easy 2@d bid; wonder why it took him so long?|pg||
nt|henryb:  5@d is certainly a reasonable contract: needs no @d loser or the club finesse and decent breaks|pg||
nt|babs59: Peter's bidding is very straight forward.  I managed to play a tournament with him last year - our first game together in more than 30 years!|pg||
nt|pelu: here a better overcall against 1@c - and in green|pg||
nt|h_karluk: btw QJ doubleton @d:)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|barnets: i would x as south|pg||
nt|rv: I would have Xed from South hand|pg||
nt|babs59: we would all have doubled as South|pg||
nt|kaz08833: EW can make 4@h here but can they bid it?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: pass for me or 2c|pg||
nt|rodal f: But by 21NS = 19EW and open from EW.......|pg||
nt|pzpp: 2@d must be waiting, with 2@h as double negative|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  this overcall may help NS |pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: passed hand 2N?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: no offense intended, please do not misunderstand me, i do not think west's pass was kind of craven coward <my review, my opinion>|pg||
mb|p|nt|friggi: 11-14|pg||
nt|alchilds: low =1|pg||
nt|sybarra: will be scramble but should be able to find 7 tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: playing clubs from the top |pg||
nt|friggi: yes low and play @C for 2-3|pg||
nt|sybarra: sometimes you just have to hope for the best|pg||
nt|friggi: if dec do so % is very much in his favour|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  but their best result is to double 4@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: Lui hesitated|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: Liu|pg||
nt|gracelin: in closed room West opened 2D to show both major, and East bid to the no-chance 4S game.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|kiwi_joker: 2H might be hearts and a minor, 3H now showing a "good" weak hand with hearts and clubs|pg||
nt|pzpp: now, 3@d transfers to @h, wrong place to play the @h contract for more than 11 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: deep think|pg||
nt|tejjyid: time for another coffee|pg||
nt|brgpro: i dont like X...why not 2@c? pd can bid any 2 level suit easily and, can support @C if ness.|pg||
pc|c9|nt|janm: 5@d is an awfully big bid! I know he has a stiff heart, but surely his partner knows it too, since he's heard the opponents bidding|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Jeff may duck a round of spades here|pg||
nt|rodal f: Should be a easy play.|pg||
nt|pelu: small @c will defeat|pg||
nt|rnmalik: oops-wrong sided.|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  2nt with fit|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 2@s would be my bid|pg||
nt|gracelin: 2NT is a good 4-card raise.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: cue promises goodish|pg||
pc|cK|nt|fabsayc: 9 tricks|pg||
nt|fabsayc: with winning heart guess|pg||
nt|pelu: the the winning lead - for declarer :(|pg||
nt|pelu: I am glad I dont have do bid 1NT on the East hand - a naturel (F!) 2@c|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer is bound to lose 3 more clubs here for the same -1 |pg||
nt|jcwla: Here a fun part of Precision - 4@S could be on wide variety of hands.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The club switch seems pretty obvious, but Hou does not even have to switch. The contract has no chance as Patrick pointed out|pg||
nt|brgpro: -3 imps anyway|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: was just going to say  not sure if Puppet :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so picked passive defense|pg||
nt|brolucius: If this is going to go down in history as an entertaining and exciting session, the Great Dealer has only four more boards to get His finger out.|pg||
pc|sT|nt|janm: And even though 2@c was in competition, it should show something, shouldn't it?|pg||
nt|cascade: considering he already stretched to 2@c|pg||
nt|ahollan1: operator alerted for me!!!|pg||
nt|barnets: and all gone minus in 4@C|pg||
nt|rv: inexperience/fatigue showing in Macau's game, it happens to all if you are playing long matches and superior opposition for the first time|pg||
nt|barnets: but thats not the point|pg||
nt|babs59: I feel more like Peng is remembering his 800 - which should have been put aside the moment it happened|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ahollan1: Thanks Amanda!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so no winning defense, both games depend on hearts|pg||
nt|pelu: but even on a small @C decl can have 9 tricks finding @HQ = 8 in Major|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, the safe route.  If south decided to switch to club, I thk he would have picked CJ.|pg||
nt|brgpro: 6 @h is not that bad contract after @s lead...|pg||
pc|s2|nt|vugraphzkt: np ... 1st time I knew what they were doing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @H9 might have been Rusinow -- promising @H10|pg||
nt|ahollan1: either way -- my $$$ on defense|pg||
nt|jcwla: No big deal here but sometimes the opps will have a quandary with a borderline hand -- you could be stealing, or have every bit of it and punish them if they go for it.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I always seem to get this wrong, which of the player names is the family name, Patrick?|pg||
nt|gracelin: Meckwell call it mixed strategy, you could bid 1S  4S with either Qxxxx  x  J10xxx  xx  or Q10x  Kxxx  AJx  Kxx.|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|pelu: bad luck for W - but with @Ds 2-2 or 3-1 4@S X = 500-800|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think he thought about ducking might have been best |pg||
nt|ahollan1: @C will be very successful choice here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @CAce that is|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and actually -- then there are 9|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no @H duck because didn't want @S shift|pg||
nt|sybarra: well its the 5/3 suit |pg||
nt|tejjyid: some reason to downgade (singleton @H) - IMO offset by good intermediates|pg||
pc|h3|nt|kiwi_joker: LOL ..and gets a reward with his 8 scoring!|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: oops|pg||
nt|pzpp: 5@h must deny control in @d, with which West will have a convenient cuebid|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: do i lead my ace ?|pg||
pc|h7|nt|rv: Macau is doing reasonably well, 8th place |pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: no|pg||

nt|rnmalik: sigh of relief.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: S not happy|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: bravo|pg||
pc|h5|nt|kaz08833: to make 4@h E must play @s now but playing 3@h trump is reasonable|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hA|nt|brgpro: needs 3-2 trumps and 4-2 @C only|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: think|pg||
pc|c7|nt|janm: Surely not? after the 2@h bid|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 5@D would have been a lot better opposite at least one club|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|fabsayc: the winning heart play is both correct initially and on the bidding|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|kiwibridge: Liu's 2@H was an underbid|pg||
nt|h_karluk: yes Patrick, really 3 Li surname at the table|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|c6|pc|d8|nt|fabsayc: since it handles a 4-1 break|pg||
pc|h2|pc|cT|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: If he's got 'count' in clubs from Tony, Sartaj should know to take this trick|pg||
nt|gracelin: The names appear first is their family names.  North Li, East another Li, West still another Li and south Hou :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: CR has finished up so welcome to those joining us from there.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Which is number one in China, Li perhaps? :)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: we almost missed it seeing all hands -- Peter Newell found the play single dummy AT THE TABLE|pg||
nt|babs59: they also defeated that 3NT that got thru at this table|pg||
nt|pelu: u are 100% correct - this time :)|pg||
pc|s7|nt|h_karluk: :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, mostly only rely on trumps to break.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|janm: The clubs could still be offside|pg||
nt|pelu: better play @cJ|pg||
nt|h_karluk: now @d6 and game over|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|henryb:  indeed|pg||
nt|pelu: then only down 1|pg||
nt|henryb:  maybe|pg||
pc|d5|nt|kaz08833: i wud choose dbl instead of 2@h|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dQ|mc|9|nt|rodal f: C10. Next|pg||
nt|gracelin: It used to be Chang, claimed to have more than 100-million Chang's in the world.  Not seeing recent statistics but Chang may still lead.|pg||

nt|vugraphzkt: it did|pg||
nt|janm: How?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: to say Newell-Reid have had a good set is quite an underbid|pg||
nt|kaz08833: dbl then 2@s or 3@h shows E's hand precisely|pg||
nt|fabsayc: however declarer should have made an overtrick|pg||
nt|fabsayc: oh he did so low club saves the overtrick|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: that was lucky|pg||
nt|rnmalik: very lucky indeed.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Li is the 4th. Zhao the number 1 I am told|pg||
mb|1S|nt|fabsayc: possible if defense never lead trumps|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Or is it Wang?|pg||
nt|brgpro: this looks an easy 6@d for ew, esp. for precision players|pg||
mb|p|nt|alchilds: yes|pg||
nt|friggi: 2@S pass out|pg||
nt|cascade: the play showed declarer leading trumps|pg||
nt|pelu: in Board 8: taipei in 7@h - and lost @DQ - West had also open only 1@S - with a 4@S-opening more easy to find @DQ - but diff to bid 7 :)|pg||
nt|rv: traditionally Chinese Taipei and Indonesia were top teams in Zone 6, now it is very competitive with China, Japan etc making rapid strides in world bridge|pg||
nt|gracelin: Kebiya can still win the match if Hengsha fails to reach 6D here. |pg||
mb|1N|nt|friggi: risky|pg||
nt|jcwla: That @ST would keep Lord Yarborough from having to pay off 1000-1.|pg||
nt|gracelin: No, Roland, the rank you mentioned is just a book of 100 names in which the order is listed.  Started with Zhao followed by Chien, Sun and Li.  Nothing to do with their popuarity.|pg||
nt|brgpro: well....after the favorite 2@h......|pg||
nt|brgpro: i mean beloved 2@h:) hope they will still love that after this hand!|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Q tripleton clubs and three little diamonds brothers, also opening leader|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@D=ART, 9-13 HCP, 4+@H, maybe longer @C/@D/@S|pg||
nt|rv: China is arguably the strongest team in whole of Asia (Zone 4-BFAME, 6-Far East) now|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: This is a real blind spot by Jeff... he should just have continued @Ds ..after that good fortune in the spade suit, he had 5@Ds, 3@Ss and a club for a certain 9|pg||
mb|2C|nt|kiwibridge: 2 tricks in the play and 7 back to CT on 23|pg||
nt|fabsayc: good situation for transfer advances|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I see|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: Well, apparently he somehow made it and now we get to see the Precision 2@c in action|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S=F1 , 4+@S|pg||

nt|barnets: multi 21D|pg||
nt|rv: some play lebensohl from North hand on 2@h by West|pg||
nt|barnets: south better not pass|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and we see them, 2@H a constructive spade raise|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: good pre-empt !|pg||
nt|h_karluk: http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=27067  Rui LI China|pg||
nt|h_karluk: the central question on this deal might be can N/S stay out of 4@s|pg||
mb|3S|nt|sybarra: and not wasted values here |pg||
nt|sybarra: well maybe the q of @D's|pg||
nt|friggi: right, freindly layout and lead as well|pg||
nt|cascade: a subdued Miller and Stout here should win back some IMPs|pg||
nt|jcwla: Finally, some pressure from N/S.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: however normal lead is @sK|pg||
nt|brgpro: 2nd hand 2@h shd be more discriptive, that is: it shd be 55, esp. vul.|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: Yes, surely he'll make at least 3 :)|pg||
nt|cascade: or rather too much aggression at the other table to wind up to 5@c|pg||
nt|sybarra: and we may play it here also |pg||
nt|Walddk2: If you count China only, Wang is number 1 several specs tell me|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: now 4@H|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well maybe, could simply be a cue raise also|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: he should expect a @s bid after a X|pg||
nt|gracelin: Wang must have out ranked Chang in recent years.|pg||
mb|p|nt|friggi: friendly|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh well forget that statement|pg||
nt|kaz08833: i guess the score is almost tie because Japan will gain another 8 on bd 25|pg||
nt|rodal f: Same bidding so fare|pg||
nt|pzpp: seems that NS plays negative free bid|pg||
nt|tejjyid: @D Q now, for fun|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|barnets: I like 4@H - 5@S|pg||
nt|pelu: best defense against 2@S is to lead @S4 - but in CR East - absolut normal - played @S A K 4 ( and stole his pds @SQ)|pg||
nt|gracelin: Jack, every team will win some prize money np matter the position they finish. So will you be entitled to share these prizes even if your name is not in te team ?  |pg||
nt|brgpro: why do they want to stay out of a cold game?|pg||
nt|brolucius: A good fit in the minors, as was an earlier board.|pg||
pc|h5|nt|henryb:  6@s looks like a much better contract|pg||
nt|barnets: 6@S|pg||
nt|npcjpn: on this hand, NS can make 3NT, but no way to reach..|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3@D was different|pg||
nt|brgpro: i dont want to take their earnings...i could go but i didnt:)|pg||
nt|xenya: blame system here?|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ahollan1: 3@H confirming 5@H along the way to showing max 1N|pg||
nt|rv: yes good auction|pg||
nt|rv: is Peng's 4N quant here?|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|sybarra: hopefully no one leads trumps too soon |pg||
nt|janm: I think a 3@c rebid with the N hand was what pushed them too high - it just has too much in the short suits and too many quacks|pg||
nt|babs59: the other table started with North bidding 2@H - both majors, weak|pg||
nt|pelu: almost for first time EW stepped wrong - down 200/300|pg||
nt|tejjyid: the old surround play|pg||
nt|brgpro: no, but the definition of the convention shd be discussed more...|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ahollan1: in college we defined  Down 1 = Good Bridge|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yes -- i was enrolled in college   no - i didn't go to class as often as i went to bridge table|pg||
nt|sybarra: LOL  |pg||
nt|sybarra: but we made it thru right?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: after a mere 16 years|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but i made LM in decent time|pg||
nt|jcwla: Meanwhile, Chinese Taipei has cut the deficit by 10 by getting to the @D game on 26 - also making 7.|pg||
nt|gracelin: That's a pity, Jack.  Kebiya is due to win US$150 from this match :)|pg||
nt|brgpro: E shd never open 2@h in this position|pg||
pc|sK|nt|rodal f: Normaly trumh would been the best lead, but E want W to lead that color.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|rnmalik: sorry-some connection.|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|sybarra: some of us "dashed" thru faster than that,  but my father who often was nice enough to pick my up from school always knew where to find me |pg||
nt|rv: I suspect not though it could be for many other partnerships since fit is not found|pg||
nt|barnets: ok well done|pg||
nt|rv: as Barnet suggested, Peng should bid 4@h to show good @s fit, mild slam try|pg||
pc|sT|nt|rv: and his direct 4n should possibly be quant?|pg||
pc|s8|nt|barnets: try and give a ruff|pg||
nt|ritong: this is a bit too precious for my taste|pg||
pc|s3|nt|barnets: looking at dummys diamonds|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|henryb:  @h by E-W should work out well, but you had better correct that|pg||
pc|s7|nt|pelu: hi Amando undo - 61H by N|pg||
nt|pelu: Amanda|pg||
nt|brgpro: they have won their first match, although a small one 16:14:)|pg||
pc|s9|nt|pelu: in OR West bid 3@d|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|h7|pg||
nt|barnets: only chance|pg||
nt|rv: as score stands with 1 deal to go, Aus winning match by 21-9|pg||
nt|rv: with only 5 VPs behind leaders Taipei before this round, this win could even more them to first place|pg||
nt|pelu: Yes as Martin say: @DQ is not unly fun - Its the way to pick up @Dj in S|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c5|nt|pelu: Lead @DK to A and now @HA made the play easy|pg||
nt|henryb:  he may go down now|pg||
nt|gracelin: another pick-up for Xinyuan. But they also have a bad board waiting for them on board  14.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Meanwhile, back at the ranch Xinyuan will add to their load of IMPs here|pg||
pc|c6|nt|tejjyid: would have been better with the @D 9 tho|pg||
nt|brgpro: i would jump to 4@s after 2@c response...|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|sybarra: (student union bridge and euche room)|pg||
nt|brolucius: If anyone had to bid more, it was South of course. He might well have done, with a possible good club fit. North was likely to hold a singleton in one of the red suits.|pg||
mc|10|nt|tejjyid: I think only 8tricks - 2D, 2@H & a @S|pg||
nt|tejjyid: the srround play looks good, but it eneded up simplifying the hand for declarer|pg||
nt|brgpro: after 2@h i would bid 3 only|pg||
nt|ritong: three aces, pard opens, let s go|pg||

nt|davidstern: But no easy road to get there|pg||
nt|gracelin: but East's 6D may succeed if south didn't lead a Heart.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: however in practice hard to defend|pg||
nt|h_karluk: now game is hot, 41-38 and last 3 boards|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  this board doesn't look like swing|pg||
nt|brolucius: After all, it was a fair game and partner had a dull 10-count. He would have passed 3@S on many 11-13 counts.|pg||
mb|2S|nt|sybarra: and of course great thx to our specs, for the helpful (and sometimes humorous comments |pg||
nt|janm: Lau chose the latter course (when I'm playing that 4 of a minor is natural, I love to be able to open it)|pg||
nt|davidstern: North will make a move and South has a max perhaps they will find it|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the real problem was a substandard neg double|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 3H nice warning|pg||
nt|gracelin: Precision 1C opening is vulnerable to high level preemptive, like here.|pg||
nt|brgpro: esp. when vul, u shd definitely have 55 i.e. ( u dont want to accept other suits)|pg||
mb|3C|nt|henryb:  another ambitious 3N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: remaining matches for the day are posted now|pg||

mb|p|nt|janm: In the other room, East also opened 4@c but his partner judged to raise |pg||
nt|kaz08833: this one shd be push|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Thanks K1W1 great job.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: 2 matches tomorrow|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: thx :)|pg||
nt|pzpp: 2 matches tomorrow? I think that they have 3 left|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: thought there were only 2 could be wrong|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that may cost to 8 IMPs|pg||
nt|brgpro: anyone for 2@h?|pg||
nt|brgpro: from W?|pg||
mb|3S|nt|fabsayc: ah, the hand that needs the heart shift|pg||
nt|cascade: an interesting point is that I think that dealing programs need to have published their algorithms to allay suspicion|pg||
nt|ahollan1: guessing 2@C = weak @C + another|pg||
nt|davidstern: There you go|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  on 24HC with no particular source of tricks|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: still a few boards to be played and scored in the open room|pg||
nt|davidstern: So this should be 7 imps to Indonesia assuming 0-1-4-5|pg||
nt|davidstern: For ten tricks|pg||
nt|rodal f: A sac at 5@C but 5@H also on|pg||
nt|gracelin: Jack obviously prefer a disciplined 2nd hand preemptive, especially at Vul. which an old man like me surely agree. |pg||
nt|ritong: pard opens AND shows unbalanced|pg||
nt|h_karluk: now that 3@c then 3@s should influence|pg||
mb|4H|nt|fabsayc: overtake and heart seems right|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: i am booked to do 2 :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: incredible ap|pg||
nt|gracelin: I don't particularly like the 4H raise at this Vul.|pg||
mb|p|nt|friggi: my guess was 3@C 3NT|pg||
nt|sybarra: quick shot of something then for you....(what ever that is) |pg||
nt|jcwla: 5 to Indonesia on 27 when Liu failed to lead A and a @S at T2 against 5@DX.|pg||
mb|p|nt|alchilds: my too may go set|pg||
nt|janm: Yes, and maybe the spade 10 should suggest shifting to a heart?|pg||
nt|pelu: again the 1NT 6-12 created the problem|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Reid -- 1st DBL = PEN  2nd DBL = Takeout [i think]|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Dont understand, if cant x 3@C bid 3@S:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: this event is really too long, we have to realize how long everybody has already been playing|pg||
nt|h_karluk: oops 3@h, 4@s|pg||
nt|brolucius: I prefer 2@S to 2@H with six cards in the major.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: however i doubt abt that cue|pg||
pc|s4|nt|janm: Guess not|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think any spade but ace is really wrong|pg||
nt|janm: Of course, they're not going to beat 4 whatever they do|pg||
nt|rodal f: Did Caledonia steel candy from the opps?:)|pg||
nt|jcwla: Me or your lying eyes?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: last board and some laughter here|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  oops|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and no double no trouble|pg||
nt|brgpro: i know many players would bid 2@H|pg||
nt|brolucius: Not much advantage in running the lead to your @SJ when you have those available tricks in clubs.|pg||
pc|s9|nt|friggi: needs @H play from Dec, diff to find|pg||
nt|sybarra: my guess is will play @D up from hand |pg||
nt|friggi: agree|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N was 13-15|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @S shift is killer|pg||
nt|sybarra: can China make a profit here?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  E is near to make it|pg||
nt|gracelin: no trouble even with doubvle this time.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|henryb:  this one needs 3@c tricks, a reasonable shot, and either 4@h and 2@s or lots of spade tricks|pg||
nt|pelu: in normal system u would pass 2@S|pg||
nt|rv: this should make 9 tricks even with likley @s finesse|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|pelu: best lead|pg||
nt|henryb:  My stomach is growling, so I will leave you. Have fun, and thanks, Peter|pg||

nt|babs59: and thank you RV and Barnet, for not jinxing Australia too much|pg||
pc|sK|nt|fabsayc: no so maybe here a bit more excusable|pg||
nt|barnets: well tks all specs and fellow commentators I am retiring for the night |pg||
pc|s2|nt|cascade: Ker at the other table is a many time NZ Chess champion|pg||
nt|fabsayc: imagine playing a football match or basketball game every day for two weeks|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: agree|pg||
nt|h_karluk: likely +420|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|ritong: but it works|pg||
nt|brgpro: still need to guess @D|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes 95% likely to work.|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|Walddk2: a complete round robin, every match you win there is 1000 yuan, ( 500 each if draw), and top 6 teams will have other money prize|pg||
nt|brgpro: W has bid too much, but justice isn't done here|pg||
nt|gracelin: when you have CQ in dummy, you don't really need CK to be on side :)|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|nt|rv: also a word of appreciation to Roland Wald who organises all these Vu graph broadcats and BBO management for telecasting it live|pg||
nt|rv: finally to all specs for listening to us patiently|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|h_karluk: one of the strong actions is likely to attract a raise to 4@c|pg||
pc|h3|nt|cascade: about 8 or 9 times i have lost count|pg||
nt|jcwla: Thanks to our excellent operator, PABF, NBZ, all specs - it's been fun.|pg||
nt|jcwla: For now, from Los Angeles, so long.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: thx :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: good match|pg||
nt|jcwla: NZB even.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ahollan1: maybe 500 now|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: E could have got a ruff|pg||
nt|rnmalik: By play small @S-guts:)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: playing|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: no after Q@d|pg||
nt|pzpp: the double of 2NT normally shows interest in penalty on at least one of the minors contract, since he does not want to double 3@c, 3@s sounds much more reasonable than pass|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: they are all packing up here instead of playing|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: now E thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: motionless|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1000 yuan is about US$150|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h9|pg||
nt|ritong: guess south wanted to keep a chance to discard all the @ds|pg||
pc|d6|nt|janm: Interesting how many people are good at both games|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  indeed :-)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: in the masters club i doubt that 4@s would attract the most votes|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|fabsayc: there is a dealing program written by a norwegian|pg||
nt|fabsayc: which produces a lot of wild hands|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this looks like that program|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it is used by some of the dealing equipment|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so wherever the equipment goes|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and i am totally convinced the hands are not random|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the technical term is pseudo random|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but in a run of say a million hands it should converge on the theoretical odds |pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: romm will stay open unti scores are finalised|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @H10 would have been very trusting - an maybe worthy of write-up|pg||
nt|sybarra: interesting position now however |pg||
nt|ahollan1: @D best|pg||
nt|rv: this is last round for the day, please join us tomorrow for more exciting matches in RR2|pg||
nt|Walddk4: One more round today|pg||
nt|Walddk4: In 40 minutes|pg||
nt|rv: sorry 1 more round today in 40 mins, thanks all|pg||
nt|babs59: what treat is in store?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Chinese Taipei vs Japan  open |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Can't remember the other one|pg||
nt|babs59: Under 26 Australia v Japan|pg||
nt|Walddk4: One from the U21 I think|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Oh, thx|pg||
nt|babs59: and Open  Chinese Taipei v Japan|pg||
nt|babs59: U21 is what I WANT Roland :)|pg||
nt|babs59: specifically Australia U21 :)|pg||
nt|babs59: of course, I know that that will happen when I have to work!!|pg||
nt|rv: Aus win this match 25-5 if this score stands|pg||
nt|rv: bye all|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: scores correct closing the room now |pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: next match begins in 30minutes |pg||
nt|rnmalik: nothing can be done now-as we know all the cards, low @H and K@H by S.|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d5|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr. More|pg||
nt|rodal f: 27-19|pg||
nt|brolucius: East knew that the defenders needed two diamond tricks, so good defence to switch to a low diamond.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: off one in case @d back|pg||
nt|brgpro: what is W thinking of? playing a @s?|pg||
nt|brolucius: East's heart will be beating a little faster...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: drums beating|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer trying to look unworried.|pg||

nt|h_karluk: interesting another Xin Yuan is in USA, Department of Computer Science , Florida State University|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  but see th score|pg||
nt|h_karluk: however nicely done|pg||
nt|h_karluk: keener competition, as i said : "the table is hot" :)|pg||
nt|brgpro: u never know....i've played many honest guys( simple souls)|pg||
nt|brolucius: It was possible that West held the @DA (if he had down-valued the singleton @HK). But no particular reason to take that diamond guess.|pg||
nt|brgpro: i dont mind to be in 6@h here...will W find a @C?|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|xenya: nice save in the CR|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  let's wait the course of auction|pg||
nt|h_karluk: say NS landed slam heart could it be easy to find killing @c lead?|pg||

mb|4D!|nt|xenya: or not?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: uh oh|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ok ty for undo:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: looks like a push here and Xinyuan is safe for their US$150.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think you can beat 4@S|pg||
nt|brolucius: North has three options. Bid the spades, agree hearts immediately (2NT) or a splinter bid of 4@D.|pg||
mb|4H|nt|xenya: yes|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i expect 4@s, anyways why not 5@d try|pg||
nt|gracelin: 3 rounds of Hearts may beat 4S, So 5D is a phantom.|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|an| |nt|brgpro: 2NT in china=GF bal hand, nothing to do with @h|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: I don't like the splinter really, because a slam may be there on power even when South does not have a particularly good fit in the diamond suit.|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: guys, we all know table pressure. last 2 boards|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: Xinyuan and Sanchen are sister clubs.  Xinyuan often enter domestic tournament under the name of Sanchen.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am told that all 10 teams are guaranteed some kind of money prize no matter where they finish|pg||
nt|jcwla: My kind of tournament.|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, from RMB12,000 for ethe winner to RMB1,000 for 9th/10th.  Total prize money is RMB 100,000.|pg||
mb|p|pc|c6|pc|c9|nt|brolucius: Yes, North had to bid again, to get his hand across, and then cue-bidding exposed the lack of a club control.|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thanks to Jack Zhao for all the info. Jack will be joining us for commentary in the next set in about 25 minutes|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c8|nt|h_karluk: hmm, i may be wrong, either 2008 or 2009 i remember the Sanchen Cup on BBO Vugraph|pg||
nt|gracelin: Will West shift to his singleton club after 2-round of H?  He shouldn't do that.|pg||
nt|brgpro: he will play a @h|pg||
nt|gracelin: East shud give a signal asking for spade continuation rather than club shift.|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  I suppose, E should convinc partner to continue @h, but how?|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c2|pg||
nt|brgpro: next|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Thanks to our operator in Beijing, and to our commentators, Patrick, Jack, Sveta, Hamdi and Vladimir|pg||
nt|gracelin: Kebiya will lose this match even if their NS bid and make 3NT here.  it's non-Vul. and only 6 imps.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and to the CCBA (Song Zao) for allowing us to broadcast|pg||
nt|h_karluk: anytime sir, tx fellows|pg||
nt|brgpro: assume u X on 1@h then 3@h comes back to u, u will see urself in a very difficult position|pg||

mb|d|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: please stay with us, today's Vugraph is really wonderful|pg||
nt|brgpro: they play 14-16 NT, so will open 1@d|pg||
mb|1S|nt|gracelin: but if Sanchen can get another imps, it will  become 19:11, so the overtrick here counts.|pg||
