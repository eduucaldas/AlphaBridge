mb|1N|nt|janm: I was about to comment that I didn't know whether N would respond 1@s (no 4-card Major) or 2@c (sound club raise)|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|janm: It's also possible that 1@s shows diamonds, but I think it's more common to play that it just denies a 4 card Major|pg||
nt|sybarra: shows D or invitatonal in NT   I am told|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s8|nt|janm: So if 1@s showed diamonds, then probably 3@d was forcing|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: bad connection again ..sorry|pg||
nt|janm: If he had an invitational hand it would be balanced and he'd probably raise 1NT |pg||
nt|janm: I like to play that a 1NT response to 1@c (if 1@c is either clubs or balanced) shows an invitation opposite a 1NT rebid - that way we can sometimes play 1NT instead of 2NT|pg||

nt|vugrapha2: I think W thinking to play K|pg||
nt|janm: If he gets a count on the hand, he'll know that E has 3 diamonds and W only 2, so the diamond finesse is a slight favorite|pg||
nt|janm: If W does play K in order to clear the hearts it will be one of those situation where the operation was successful but the patient died, since the heart Q will be S's ninth trick|pg||
nt|bg: E is going to find it troublesome to discard on the clubs if he throws two hearts S may set up heart Q|pg||

mb|p|mb|5S|mb|p|nt|bg: good series they will find out that one king missing but if they get aggressive then the heart jack is sitting nicely|pg||

nt|janm: All those onside finesses will also be good for EW on defense - let's seee - 4 spades, 1 heart, 1 diamond, 1 club? So -4 for 800, pretty good compensation for a slam they weren't ...|pg||

mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|janm: That's a good question - would W's DBL say lead a club or don't lead a club? And if it would say "don't" so he doesn't DBL, woul East lead the club A to beat it? Maybe should, ...|pg||
nt|janm: since there aren't many alternative sources of tricks|pg||

nt|sybarra: back in about just over 1 hour |pg||
nt|janm: What was the DBL of 3@h do you suppose? "Don't lead a heart" maybe?|pg||
nt|nickf: if he makes this then Noble win by 22 which is a 20-10 win|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|nt|sybarra: hi Serhat, @H    glad we are up and running |pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|janm: 1@h almost certainly shows 4+ spades and 2@s shows a raise with 4 card support.|pg||
nt|sybarra: 1 @H  was transfer to @s |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|sQ|nt|janm: I'm always careful to describe the responses to 1@c as showing 4+ in the suit above, not as a "transfer" since they don't force the opener to bid the suit that is shown.|pg||

nt|janm: Different people have different agreements about what they do over the "transfer" responses - some play that DBL says "I would have bid what he just bid" but apparently this EW ...|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s7|nt|janm: 3NT is a little aggressive, but no one likes to play 2NT - so often you either can't take 8 tricks or can take 9|pg||
nt|sybarra: often they say "where there is 8 there is 9" |pg||
nt|janm: Although on this hand, I think 8 may actualy be the mot likely number of tricks to come home|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|janm: 2 spades, 2 diamonds and 4 clubs - with 2 dummy entries, there are 3 diamonds, via the double finesse, but there aren't 2 dummy entries|pg||

pc|hK|mc|8|nt|janm: Surely more likely to find diamonds 33, or QJ doubleton, than the QJ onside, so his line was almost certainly right, even if it didn't work|pg||
