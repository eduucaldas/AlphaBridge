mb|1H|mb|p|nt|gavin:  when your opponents are in an 8 card fit and you have Axxx, it is extremely important not to win it too early|pg||
mb|1N|mb|d|mb|r|nt|gavin:  what tends to happen , if you duck it ...|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|gavin:  declarer will not be able to draw all of your trumps until you win it, |pg||
nt|gavin:  so if declarer is on a mission to pull your trumps, but also needs to take some ruffs|pg||
nt|gavin:  you can wait until a later round to place ace and another heart clearing the trumps from one of their hands|pg||
mb|p|nt|gavin:  if u win ace then declarer can take their ruffs and draw your trumps at their leisure|pg||
nt|gavin:  suprised south didnt compete to 2@D|pg||
pc|c2|nt|gavin:  with no defense and quite a lot of offence|pg||
nt|starkist: very|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|pc|c3|pg||
nt|gavin:  their partner had shown a maximum hand (in their system 16)|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cQ|pc|c4|pc|c7|pg||
nt|gavin:  so they know they have half the deck|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|pc|d9|pc|dK|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c9|pc|d8|pc|c8|pg||
nt|gavin:  that same logic (holding half the deck) was a very good motivation for a trump lead|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sT|nt|gavin:  since each side has about 20 points, you really want to limit your opponents trump tricks|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|pc|d7|nt|gavin:  to have a chance to beat the contract (need 6 out of 13 tricks)|pg||

nt|vugraphzjp: by pumping his fist in the air|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: it seems that pumping your fist shows a strong nt|pg||
mb|2C|mb|2D|nt|vugraphzjp: sorry for the slow start all...will just claim at the end of this hand for you|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: and pinching your fingers together shows a weak (small) nt|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzjp: taylor just sighed as 3c was passed back to him|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjp: tough to find the qs lead here|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h3|nt|vugraphzjp: klimo just called for a small diamond|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: nobody believed that is what he wanted though|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d8|pc|d9|pc|dK|pg||

pc|d5|pc|h4|pc|c3|pc|d6|pg||
pc|s7|nt|vugraphzjp: he instinctively pulled out the 4@S and then decided to think about it|pg||

pc|hK|pc|h5|pc|h6|pc|c7|pg||

nt|lml: and they have a spade and a club to come|pg||
nt|lml: down 1|pg||
nt|lml: the lie of the cards was not much fun for east-west|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: this result is better for EW than -110 for -130|pg||
nt|lml: -50 is not too bad |pg||
nt|lml: I am not sure what Keith Balcombe is thinking about|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h7|pc|d2|pc|cT|pg||
nt|lml: a spade back seems right be then again a heart doesnt hurt|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: they would be -110 or -130 defending 3d on this hand|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s6|pc|s8|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|lml: its total tricks... what lies badly for you lies well for me|pg||

nt|gavin:  on another lead declarer would have been able to trump a diamond for his 8th trick|pg||
mb|p|nt|caitlin: closed room got @ST lead on that 3@C down one|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|starkist: saving grace to beat it|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|gavin:  in the other room the defense wasted a key spot card in diamonds to make some sort of signal and it ended up costing them |pg||
nt|gavin:  in 3nt|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|gavin:  this diamond suit CAN be played for no losers legitimently|pg||
pc|hT|nt|gavin:  if you believe east has a singleton, the best way to play the suit is to lead the jack from your hand|pg||
nt|gavin:  after the king is played and you win the ace, if the 9 or T drops, you can finesse west for the remaining Tx or 9x respectively|pg||
pc|h4|nt|gavin:  in the other room, declarer made the normal play of low from their hand and had west played low declarer would take a winning Queen finesse, however...|pg||
nt|gavin:  the KT would surround the Jack for a sure winner|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|pc|dQ|pc|d9|pg||
pc|dA|pc|c9|nt|gavin:  now it is up to the defense to realize that they can drop the king of hearts under the ace|pg||
nt|francine21: You don't think jack of @D is better|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dT|pg||
nt|gavin:  it is probably better|pg||
nt|gavin:  i was just thking about it|pg||
pc|d5|nt|gavin:  congrats francine :) seemed like it was never in doubt|pg||
pc|c6|pc|dJ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|gavin:  west can count points|pg||
nt|gavin:  not enough in the deck to beat unless partner has 5@H|pg||
nt|francine21: TY|pg||
nt|gavin:  going back to the last few compared boards of the last set, gartaganis is on about a 60 imp roll here|pg||
pc|hA|nt|francine21: When you play smith echo and you have only one card in the suit led at the second trick may be the 3 should tell partner that you like or don't like the lead|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h3|pc|hK|pg||
pc|h9|pc|c2|pc|hJ|pc|s4|pg||
pc|h7|pc|s8|pc|h2|pc|c5|pg||
pc|h6|pc|c7|pc|sJ|pc|d6|pg||
pc|s5|nt|caitlin: smith echo a way of giving attitude to opening lead by defenders|pg||
mc|7|nt|caitlin: right Steve Robinson--but you never signal with a possible trick|pg||
nt|vugraphzjz: little break|pg||
pg||
qx|c2|st||md|4SA984HKQDJ732CK74,SJ62HAT92DKT4CAJ8,SK3H54DAQ865CQT52,SQT75HJ8763D9C963|sv|n|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: its possible to make 5@D but requires some guessing ... 3NT on a heart lead will not make|pg||
nt|lml: if you lead the @H2 you could block the suit|pg||
pc|hT|nt|lml: that is one of the reasons your bridge teacher tells you to lead the @H10|pg||
nt|lml: Gord has learned that lesson!|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|lml: so Ross knows he needs another trick even if he guesses diamonds|pg||
nt|lml: he could try to sneak a club threw|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dT|pc|dQ|pc|d9|pg||
nt|lml: playing the @D10 was not best|pg||
nt|lml: his teacher would have told him that too|pg||
nt|lml: it was never going to gain and here it gave up the diamond suit|pg||
nt|lml: so now Ross could try to sneak the club threw or run diamonds and put pressure on his opponents|pg||
nt|lml: hoping that the long hand gives up a heart|pg||
pc|dA|pc|c6|pc|d2|pc|d4|pg||
pc|d5|nt|lml: thats the good thing about being a very good player ... nobody believes you made a mistake|pg||
pc|c3|pc|dJ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|lml: Ross was sure that Campbell had a doubleton diamond|pg||
nt|lml: he doesnt actually need to cash out at this point|pg||
nt|lml: yes than you the name grosvenor can be heard wafting around|pg||
nt|lml: if they cash out it will make the play go faster so I am for that|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|pc|s7|pc|s4|pg||
pc|d8|pc|c9|nt|lml: they took the slow road|pg||
pc|d7|nt|lml: this will now go very slowly .......|pg||
nt|lml: Klim can throw a spade on the next trick so he is comfortable but campbell isnt sure what to throw|pg||
nt|lml: a heart cant be that wrong|pg||
nt|lml: but which black card|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: exactly what is happening|pg||
nt|lml: what is the @C9 telling him|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: he is mouthing numbers as he is thinking...counting something...|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: or possibly some sort of western canada prayer|pg||
nt|lml: trying to figure out where the rest of the high cards are|pg||
nt|lml: what can Piotr have?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: he almost played a card|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: there it is|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|d6|pc|h8|nt|lml: he should  have made both decisions by now|pg||
pc|s9|nt|lml: and we are headed for one down.|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|lml: a spade would have been a better discard from East but he isnt sure what is going on either|pg||
pc|c2|pc|h6|pc|cK|nt|vugraphzjp: klimo better unblock his hearts!|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pc|h7|pc|hK|pg||
nt|lml: oh dear|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: whoooooops!|pg||
nt|lml: that is a big woops!|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: campbell has a quizzical look on his face now|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: klimo just conceded|pg||
mc|9|nt|vugraphzjp: and is taking a break|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: campbell has his head in his hands|pg||
nt|lml: so never give up|pg||
nt|lml: run your winners and sometimes even the best ones get the discards wrong|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: ross and keith are very very silent right now|pg||
nt|lml: its the silence of about 13 imps|pg||

mb|5D|nt|niclecuyer: ooops|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjp: careful defense should nip this|pg||
mb|5S|nt|vugraphzjp: maybe even beat it 2...lack of entries to the West hand to take both D finesses and H finesses|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: Taylor has a lot of trust in Balcombe's Dbl|pg||

nt|lml: whe can always overtake the diamond|pg||
nt|lml: its playing for the overtricks that is slowing this down|pg||

nt|buffytvs: everyone getting tired|pg||
nt|buffytvs: Gartaganis is 4-handed, and Korbel virtually so|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s2|nt|niclecuyer: ok |pg||

nt|niclecuyer: braaavo Ross...|pg||

nt|niclecuyer: Piotr will guess this I think|pg||
nt|gavin:  they typically will try to see if they can figure out who has more @C|pg||
nt|gavin:  because the person who has 4, is more likely to have the queen, 4-3|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: I would go down because it is the club Q and I cannot guess that Q|pg||
nt|gavin:  rather than just flipping a coin which is 50-50|pg||
nt|gavin:  so east is going to try to place shapes|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|gavin:  as declarer it looks like south has 4@S,4@H (south played 3@H, 2@H, doesnt seem like J32)|pg||

pc|d4|nt|buffytvs: much to declarer's relief|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|hA|pc|h4|nt|gavin:  whenever you have the ace of trumps to length (in this case 3)  more often than not you should not win it on the first round|pg||

nt|dannymiles: Hi Gavin! Bye Gavin!|pg||
nt|gavin:  hey :)|pg||
mc|10|nt|vugraphzjz: hi gavin|pg||
nt|gavin:  in this case obviously nothing mattered, but its a very common mistake to win the ace of trumps too early when you are the long hand|pg||

nt|lml: and the last board of the set|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|lml: double is a touch pushy with 11 and only 3 spades|pg||
nt|lml: but the vulnerability is right|pg||
