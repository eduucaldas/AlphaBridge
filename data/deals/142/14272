nt|gavin:  in this auction north doesnt really promise a heart stopper|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|gavin:  with a balanced hand they are endplayed into bidding 1NT|pg||
nt|gavin:  8 imps however gartaganis has had the best of hte uncompared boards|pg||

pc|d7|pc|s3|pc|s6|nt|starkist: they passed the double like gavin suggested|pg||
nt|gavin:  i dont know what is correct, but it seems normal to pass|pg||
nt|gavin:  at this form of the game , where there isnt a huge difference between +500 and +600|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|h4|nt|starkist: we had 5@d made though|pg||
nt|starkist: not piglet :)|pg||
pc|c4|pc|hA|nt|gavin:  yeah it was definitely a winner to bid 5@D on this layout since it was makeable|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hK|pc|hJ|pc|c8|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s4|nt|gavin:  quite easily makeable|pg||

mb|1C|mb|1H|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|bg: now we start getting comparisons|pg||

mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzjp: JD lead will be a killer|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: or 9@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: and there it is|pg||
mb|p|pc|d9|nt|flash: good board to stretch; refill cup; etc...|pg||
nt|fabsayc: spades blocked|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dT|nt|buffytvs: hi again|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: Hi Ray...a snafu for EW here|pg||
nt|fabsayc: club shift beats this|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s8|pc|sJ|pc|s4|pg||
nt|buffytvs: yes -- aren't you supposed to try to have more trumps than the opps?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: 2d was a xfer|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: usually the best situation|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d6|pc|d3|pc|dA|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this might have been winning shift had declarer had say Ax in spades|pg||
pc|d4|pc|h3|pc|dK|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|fabsayc: still to me the club shift is so obvious|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|h5|pc|c7|pc|h2|pg||
nt|czyzyk: Did he really do it?|pg||
nt|flash: cutting the lead in half...|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: 1 imps for Korbel here|pg||
pc|d7|pc|s2|nt|lml: back again|pg||
pc|c9|pc|h7|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|c4|pc|h6|nt|buffytvs: niecly done -- they've maneuvered to get South on play to lead a ttrump through|pg||
nt|buffytvs: after which North can claim|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: a diamond for down 4...anything else is down 3|pg||
pc|hK|pg||

mb|2D|mb|p|nt|thurston:  7 making on club finesse!!! WOW!!|pg||
nt|gavin:  (partner may have a doubleton club, or the queen , or the queen of diamonds|pg||
mb|2H!|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|gavin:  this is a major flaw to old fashioned kokish relay|pg||
nt|gavin:  his 2@H forced a 2@S bid to either show @H or a big balanced hand|pg||
nt|thurston:  yes, 3 level before E knopws why W opened 2C|pg||
nt|gavin:  the big balanced hand would bid 2NT and all the @H bid a 2nd natural bid|pg||
nt|starkist: 28 point grand will review that auction :)|pg||
nt|gavin:  modern expert standard is after 2@H-2@S  to play 3@C shows a single suited @H hand and 3@H is @H and @C|pg||
nt|gavin:  so that partner can actually show a fit |pg||
nt|gavin:  in this auction korbel has no bid for his hand|pg||
nt|gavin:  might just bid 6@H|pg||
nt|gavin:  or 4NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzjz: you tell u brother that|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|mb|5N|mb|p|nt|gavin:  now 6@C, 6@D , 7NT|pg||
nt|gavin:  or 7@H rather|pg||
nt|gavin:  seems very likely|pg||
mb|6C|nt|gavin:  west has all the information he needs to know the grand is at worst on a finesse|pg||
mb|p|nt|gavin:  possibly cold|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|nt|gavin:  6@C showed the K@C, 6@D said i have something more (either K@S or K@D)|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: he is about to bid 7 no?|pg||
nt|gavin:  yes he will bid 7@H i think|pg||
nt|francine21: mais il y en a un a 116|pg||
nt|caitlin: 2@S is Kokish   nothing to do with spades|pg||
nt|francine21: sorry private|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: he will bid 7|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: comon Darren - for that chicken feet soup in Yoko, do it for old time sake|pg||
nt|starkist: and the academy award goes to...|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: BID 7 :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjz: he is squeezing his face|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: kibitzer are asking me to speak louder...)|pg||
nt|starkist: cant hear over the party noise|pg||
nt|vugraphzjz: party gone|pg||
nt|caitlin: Nicolas a former partner of Darren's:)|pg||
nt|thurston:  in nt only club finesse makes it but in hts can pitch club Jack and try to drop club Q in 3 rds (last a ruff)|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|czyzyk: On the other hand he knows pard probably has @hQ together with @DAK and a passed hand. He may expect the other table to be in 7. If he needs a swing...|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|gavin:  in reality, if korbel had the queen of clubs or a doubleton club , he would know to bid 7 himself|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: oh no.... |pg||
nt|gavin:  so he basically knows its on a club finesse|pg||
mc|13|pg||
qx|c18|st||md|4SQJ765HJTD975CQ86,SA2HAK87653D3CAKJ,SK943HDQJT864C974,ST8HQ942DAK2CT532|sv|n|nt|mittmouse: good result for e-w in the closed room|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: yes|pg||
nt|mittmouse: very hard to stop in 2|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: I wonder if he will make 1SP if it gets passed out|pg||
nt|flash: Big Club certainly helped in Closed Room|pg||
nt|buffytvs: so that will eat into the lead somewhat|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: words between EW whether 2d is a transfer or not|pg||
nt|buffytvs: and have EW feeling queasy to start the session|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: klimo put his foot down and that was that|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: this hand can make a lot of tricks|pg||
nt|lml: so I hope their heads are back|pg||
nt|buffytvs: all of them|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: 7s looks very nice|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: even 7d, but i dont think they will bid that one|pg||
nt|buffytvs: 5@C exclusion anyone?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: jacoby 2N anyone?|pg||
mb|1C|an|16+|mb|2D|nt|niclecuyer: probably play 3H now|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: or not|pg||
nt|buffytvs: oh|pg||
nt|lml: that is one approach but I prefer going slower|pg||
nt|buffytvs: me too|pg||
mb|2N|nt|vugraphzjp: 7h and 7n both on the club finesse|pg||
mb|p|nt|niclecuyer: ooh forget my comment I thought he was gonna bid 2NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: this should play quickly|pg||
nt|buffytvs: can't recommend that bid|pg||
nt|buffytvs: now Piotr is really ging to upset I suspect|pg||
nt|lml: of course I dont normally like to play grands but this one is an exception|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: i only like to play grands when they make|pg||
nt|buffytvs: so this will be a test of partnership nerve -- two bad results to start the set|pg||
nt|lml: without a ruff on the opening lead ....|pg||
nt|lml: you see the last board set up this board|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: no lead yet|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: taylor asking questions now|pg||
nt|buffytvs: tell him it doesnt matter :)|pg||
nt|lml: what questions can you ask on this auction!|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: i will find out|pg||
nt|lml: do you play Blackwood|pg||
nt|buffytvs: whcih page of your system notes is this auction on?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: i think he is asking about the range of the opening bid|pg||
nt|lml: did you pull the right card from the bidding box|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: told 10+ to 17-|pg||
nt|lml: ok|pg||
nt|lml: but you would think they would know that already by this time in this match|pg||
nt|buffytvs: Piotr must have been close to a 1@C opener then|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: 2d was alerted, but i cant tell what it is from the explanations|pg||
nt|buffytvs: hi all|pg||
mb|3H|nt|buffytvs: that would have made a difference probably|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|nt|fabsayc: actually you dont need club finesse, can ruff out the suit|pg||
nt|buffytvs: back after the birthday BBQ for my 4-yr-old grandaughter|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hi Ray|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: you missed all the action in the last set|pg||
mb|p|nt|mittmouse: i like that pass of a jump shift white i wouldnt pass vulnerable|pg||
nt|lml: I would open it 1@C myseld|pg||
mb|4S|nt|lml: myself|pg||
nt|lml: but that may not be their style|pg||
nt|lml: it is a touch quacky|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: saw that -- after the earlier set, I thought Korbel might put the match away while I was at dinner, but the opposite seems to have occurred|pg||
mb|5C|nt|fabsayc: what is 5@C?|pg||
nt|gambit: yes, wonderful see-saw match |pg||
nt|niclecuyer: yes it was a very difficult set |pg||
nt|niclecuyer: for Korbel's teal|pg||
nt|buffytvs: ruffing out clubs here is pretty much the same % as the finesse, but on this layout both lines work|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: no explanations being passed to me|pg||
nt|buffytvs: was 4@S keycard?|pg||
nt|gambit: must be|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: probably |pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|nt|niclecuyer: same|pg||
mb|6D|nt|fabsayc: 7 coming|pg||
nt|gambit: q ask?|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: ruffing out clubs is 3-3 or doubleton queen = 52%|pg||
nt|fabsayc: finesse is 50%|pg||
mb|7N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|po-s: minus is minus even vulnerable...|pg||
nt|buffytvs: so pretty much identical to cashing the ace and finessing|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: any line would lead to making 7|pg||
mb|p|nt|gambit: no ruffing now....|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but after the preempt i think the finesse is %|pg||
nt|buffytvs: but in 7NT he won't be ruffing anything out :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes he crossed me up|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: well 7NT will make as well|pg||
nt|lml: Hi everybody|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: all the matchpoints|pg||
nt|lml: I see I came to see the grand!|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: Hi Linda|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: just in time|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: East has 1 ace, 1 Q of H, K of D and maybe more...must have been kickback|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: 8c lead...put East to the test at trick 1|pg||
pc|d5|nt|fabsayc: not really|pg||
nt|buffytvs: not really -- he would play the ace anyway|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: thats true|pg||
nt|lml: this grand in notrump is of the school if there are twelve thrist then there are thirteen|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: making 7NT on these cards is not good really, 7H is fine although it is a lot of bidding but 7NT is not good :(|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dT|nt|buffytvs: sure it is -- it's bidding it that's bad :)|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|pc|cA|nt|flash: welcome to PO Sundelin|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: welcome|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|hA|pc|d6|nt|lml: the workst part is that he does have to take the finesse early|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|hK|pc|d4|pc|h4|nt|lml: there is no other play, no magic just a club finesse|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|h3|nt|niclecuyer: and tennis result is?|pg||
nt|buffytvs: he can't run that many hearts because he can't get back to hand...|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: club finesse coming|pg||
pc|d8|nt|po-s: thanks - have spent exhausting hours kibitzing tennis instead|pg||
nt|czyzyk: Hi P-O|pg||
nt|buffytvs: so 2 ore then the big moment|pg||
nt|buffytvs: more|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|s5|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lml: after the diamond lead he could just delay the inevitable a few tricks|pg||
pc|c8|nt|flash: line seems a bit strange - if as seen, declarer's dropped a trick|pg||
nt|po-s: Nadal after tiebreak in third|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|flash: down 1 or down 2??|pg||

mb|p|nt|starkist: sure looked like a deciding hand|pg||
nt|czyzyk: this hand, Nic?|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: no the match|pg||

nt|starkist: bd 29, will go snoop|pg||

pc|c2|nt|gavin:  commited to not playing game with an opening bid|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|gavin:  was definitely right on this hand|pg||

nt|vugraphzjp: klimo just put his hand on the table and all very quietly put their cards back in the board|pg||
nt|lml: without a diamond lead maybe there would be a squeeze of some sort... here only luck|pg||
nt|buffytvs: it's always nice to have a board you know you can't lose IMPs on|pg||
nt|lml: or even mps|pg||
nt|lml: matchpoints|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: you never played 7n redoubled?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|flash: Closed Room playing 24, so we may see some activity on the scoreboard soon|pg||
nt|po-s: will they give comparisons today as opposed to testerday?|pg||
nt|flash: for those joining us along the way, the tables started exactly half the boards apart, leaving us waiting until now for any scores/comparisons|pg||
nt|buffytvs: Gord can't have been worried about the club save at that vulnerability|pg||
nt|lml: he thought .. partner probably cant have enough to make grand with a limited hand|pg||
nt|lml: it would hard to find it all out anyway|pg||
nt|lml: its smarter to be lucky than its lucky to be smart|pg||
nt|buffytvs: actually no :) -- except in a Ghoulie game|pg||
mb|2H|an|natural|nt|lml: so I will just bid the slam which has to have a play|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: not so sure|pg||
nt|lml: you think he wanted to stop opponents from bidding clubs?|pg||
nt|buffytvs: 1@S-4@C; 4@D would have been a pretty good start|pg||
nt|lml: nah|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: that subtle 2c bid, and 2s underbid, might just keep EW out of game|pg||
nt|buffytvs: no not at those coloursa|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|niclecuyer: 2H = good heart raise |pg||
nt|flash: 2@H good raise to 2@S?|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: spade raise|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: I meant|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: y|pg||
nt|flash: the other room used XX to show the high @S honor (ok to lead)|pg||
nt|po-s: who is George talking to?|pg||
nt|flash: or, since we're broadcasting from Canada, honour...|pg||
pc|h9|nt|lml: oh I hate the bidding but that was the thought process|pg||
nt|lml: now this is a vulnerable game|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: I played in the Blue Ribbon 6NT XX redoubled down 1 in Birmingham once because I chose the wrong squeeze - could not sleep for 2 months|pg||
pc|h8|nt|lml: it is a but lucky but it will make|pg||
nt|buffytvs: not a great one -- 25% at best|pg||
nt|buffytvs: but it does make...|pg||
nt|buffytvs: well that solves the problem of how to get to dummy for a trmp finesse|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|flash: avoiding the X|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: 2 imps to Gartaganis|pg||
pc|hA|nt|buffytvs: so another 'soft' result EW...|pg||
pc|h6|pc|s3|pc|h4|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: although they have to be careful|pg||
nt|po-s: not yet|pg||
nt|flash: Board 25 in as a push|pg||
nt|mittmouse: i suppose they could get this wrong|pg||
nt|lml: the deense was sooner or later going to lead trump|pg||
pc|d2|nt|po-s: the spade 2 is either count, attitude or suit pref|pg||
nt|mittmouse: although i think with 4 spades in the dummy the 2 should be suit preference|pg||
nt|lml: on a non club lead you can try the @H10 and then the @HQ|pg||
nt|lml: so its better than that|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dQ|nt|bg: W made an constructive raise so must have either heart ace or dia ace try hearts first|pg||
nt|flash: i'd think that West's card was suit preference|pg||
nt|gambit: I think it is imperative to remember that these players have played for a week, and to see such a close fought match is a treat for all of us|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|buffytvs: and both teams effectively 4-handed too|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: i saw danny miles here (korbel's fifth player) during the short break before this set|pg||
nt|lml: north south will make 4 on this friendly lie of the cards|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: I have to admit I don't feel as forgiving as everyone else about playing 4 handed|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think they should allow bench players you can bring in for the finals|pg||
nt|buffytvs: in the sense that it's self-inflicted?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: agree, nicholas|pg||
pc|s2|nt|czyzyk: I agree with George, @D 10 is threatening|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: unless you are 185 years old, is it that bad to be playing 4 handed?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|gambit: playing 4 is tough|pg||
pc|s4|nt|gambit: yes|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|po-s: I agree |pg||
nt|buffytvs: i guess|pg||

nt|buffytvs: I think its tough to play for a week every set|pg||

pc|dJ|nt|buffytvs: but North had the wrong major king unfortunately|pg||
nt|buffytvs: on such things do championships hang|pg||

nt|fabsayc: you need to be able to unwind occasionally or tensions and errors occur|pg||

nt|gavin:  or |pg||
nt|gavin:  try cashing diamonds |pg||

nt|buffytvs: another slam here EW potentially|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: another friendly lie of the cards for EW|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: 6D|pg||
mb|1D|nt|niclecuyer: hi|pg||
nt|po-s: I think West should have played small on the heart|pg||
nt|lml: this is too much fun to miss|pg||
nt|lml: at this point you start wishing you had a yarboro|pg||
mb|d|nt|fabsayc: 6@D but not 6@H|pg||
nt|gambit: if 1@D followed by double, no slam will be bid|pg||
nt|buffytvs: better play in diamonds though|pg||
mb|r|nt|niclecuyer: I love 1NT...|pg||
nt|buffytvs: no -- I'd rather have a couple of 1NT-3Nt lead and claim deals|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mittmouse: korbel will open 1nt as would i|pg||
nt|lml: so does everybody.|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: best way to score stiff Ks|pg||
nt|lml: 4@S not bad|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: K@D lead pretty normal here|pg||
nt|lml: 3@S by campbell?|pg||
nt|buffytvs: pretty good actually, but one of them is going to have to take a push to get there|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: declarer will have to rely on both the spade and club finesses, which both work...|pg||
nt|lml: he just needs one|pg||
nt|buffytvs: just needs the spade finesse for 4|pg||
nt|lml: he can afford to give up 3 offsuit tricks|pg||
nt|buffytvs: or the heart ace onside|pg||
nt|gambit: 3 or 4 @S?|pg||
nt|lml: I prefer 1@H to redouble unless that denies 10 points|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the redouble is so ineffective that playing it to show hearts makes sense|pg||
nt|lml: oh sorry, it is a transfer|pg||
mb|4D|nt|fabsayc: i think so|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but maybe not|pg||
nt|lml: if North bids 4@S it is mostly momentum|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: Ross asked Gord 'does it say anything about hearts'....the answer was NO|pg||
nt|val44: Polakow 2300 4hx down 9 in first board|pg||
nt|gambit: 2@S seems a little timid, shows more in my book, perhaps that was Ross' intent|pg||
nt|lml: well then back to I prefer bidding hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|niclecuyer: they really played 2NT in the other room?|pg||
nt|mittmouse: good dbl |pg||
nt|bg: double may scare off 3nt|pg||
nt|po-s: good says the peeker|pg||
nt|flash: note the Big Club auction in the other room...    1@D opener with the East hand|pg||
nt|mittmouse: wo the dbl he might have led a s against 3nt and now declarer has good chances|pg||
nt|bg: may opt for a moysian fit in spades|pg||
mb|5D|nt|buffytvs: they won;t get there now I don;t think|pg||
nt|lml: he can try the club for a heart pitch if he wants|pg||
nt|gambit: me too|pg||
nt|val44: sorry wrong direct|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: and this will be four in a row|pg||
nt|lml: omg  this is painful to watch|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: another opportunity missed|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: If I were one of them I would definitely take a washroom break after this|pg||
nt|lml: I think that playing forcing club when partner voluntarily bid 1NT then you should bid 3@S with the West hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|po-s: declarer might misguess clubs|pg||
nt|flash: it certainly seems as though their stopping was asystemic, though|pg||
nt|gambit: stripe tail? :) just kidding|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lml: this is a hard slam to bid but the redouble and the 4@D bid all made it harder|pg||
pc|s3|nt|po-s: it seems like all games depend on club guess|pg||
nt|lml: and I think that in the previous set or the next set Campbell might have done that|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sT|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: with the double it seems possible to guess clubs|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: difficult hand to bid|pg||
nt|lml: and it is on a finesse |pg||
nt|gambit: the lack of a heart bid did not help W|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: can we have a new rule aboyt bidding slam?|pg||
nt|lml: this is at most on a finesse|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|gambit: Bill Maher, new rules...|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mittmouse: why|pg||
nt|buffytvs: they were very aggressive yesertday in the bidding|pg||
nt|lml: but he isn't really here now|pg||
nt|buffytvs: got to some very tight games|pg||
nt|lml: oddly because when you lose because you underbid you often start to overcompensate|pg||
nt|lml: clearly not the case here|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cA|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: heart length on the right...|pg||
nt|mittmouse: campbell may play a c|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: but diamonds are so bad 5Cl looks like too much|pg||
pc|d2|nt|flash: 5 IMPs on Board 26 - that's the one where the weak raise to 2@H wasn't passed by Wolpert|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dQ|nt|vugraphzjp: campbell staring at the ceiling for an answer|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: and now he just claimed he didnt see the card played|pg||
nt|lml: so it isn't so terrible to miss it except that this time it makes|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: key moment?|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: if it makes, I am allowed to bid 6... ok? |pg||
pc|d9|pc|dJ|nt|buffytvs: another problem with playing 4-handed is that when a pair has a bad set, you can't let them sit out and regroup|pg||
pc|dA|pc|s4|pg||
nt|lml: sure|pg||
pc|dK|nt|gambit: claiming quickly no doubt|pg||
pc|s7|pc|h3|pc|d8|pg||
nt|po-s: would North double 3H with CK, DA and HK?|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: is that what really happend?|pg||
nt|lml: I plan to only bid slams that make :)|pg||
pc|d7|pc|c2|pc|h5|pc|s6|pg||
mc|12|nt|gambit: sorry, you have to bid it |pg||

pc|s8|nt|lml: this seems normal and looks like a push at last|pg||
nt|buffytvs: but no-one's interested|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: 2 imp swing on the lead|pg||
nt|lml: dont push when you are in this state|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I|pg||
nt|lml: yes zone 1|pg||
nt|lml: or is it zone 3|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I'd lead a club -- partner had a chance to bid hearts at the 1-level and didn't|pg||
pc|s9|nt|vugraphzjp: and a push|pg||
nt|buffytvs: but that's why I'm sitting here and they're playing a championship final :)|pg||
nt|lml: I like a heart the unbid major and J10x is a nice lead|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|buffytvs: if you lead a heart you need partner to have 3 good hearts for tricks and a trick outside|pg||
nt|buffytvs: he might easily have 5 clubs ace or KQ, and that's all you need him to have|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: that lead is not on their card|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c2|nt|lml: 5 to the K might be enough|pg||
nt|buffytvs: exactly|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c4|nt|lml: no I mean 5 hearts|pg||
nt|lml: but true about clubs too|pg||
nt|buffytvs: with 5 hearts and about an 8-count he might have overcalled|pg||
nt|buffytvs: he couldn't overcall clubs with a weak hand|pg||
nt|lml: his hearts would have been pretty lousy|pg||
nt|buffytvs: KQ98x and a side card? overcall for the lead?  |pg||
nt|buffytvs: I agree it's not cast-iron, but you look for whatever tiny inferences you can get|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: keith did it with his 2c bid a couple hands ago|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: and that was at the 2 level|pg||
pc|cT|nt|buffytvs: yes but I'm assuming that wasn't normal|pg||

nt|gambit: strong NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: 1 IMP on 28 for the extra overtrick in here|pg||

nt|lml: I thought that might be the auction.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: cant it be 19-20?|pg||
nt|lml: It hard to visualize the slam|pg||
nt|buffytvs: West likely to have asted heart cards|pg||
nt|buffytvs: wasted|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but there is no rush to bid four|pg||

nt|fabsayc: your already in a game force|pg||

pc|h4|pc|h7|nt|niclecuyer: why the heart ace?|pg||
pc|s5|pc|h8|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|lml: I suppose in the worst case you can fall back on the finesse of the @D9|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|flash: needed to pop the Ace and continue the tap|pg||
pc|c3|pc|h9|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|nt|flash: this is um; er...   mystifying|pg||
pc|d9|nt|lml: so its no worse than50%|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|gambit: finesse the 9@D?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|lml: like that|pg||
mc|12|nt|buffytvs: yes -- if clubs don't work|pg||
nt|gambit: 5 not 5|pg||
nt|buffytvs: so better than 50% probably|pg||
nt|gambit: not 6|pg||
nt|lml: you are probably going to have to make that play on a trump lead|pg||
nt|lml: the entries are short for 6|pg||
nt|buffytvs: without a trump lead you have quite good chances|pg||
nt|lml: but finessing the @d9 does work|pg||
nt|gambit: yes, like Litvak, good on opening lead|pg||
nt|lml: yes so 50% plus the wrong lead|pg||
nt|gambit: was it 6? should be 5 |pg||
nt|lml: not a terrible slam|pg||
nt|val44: I am not sure what system they are playing but E hand could make light slam try|pg||
nt|lml: I think it was 6|pg||
nt|fabsayc: strong club|pg||
nt|buffytvs: but in the event, no swing, another board safely negotiated for Gartaganis and the lead stays at 32|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so 4@S was a tired bid IMO|pg||
nt|lml: I dont think it was that bad although I do prefer going slower|pg||

nt|lml: see|pg||
nt|lml: omg!|pg||
nt|lml: 4@D seems a tad high|pg||
nt|lml: and it started off with a lousy overcall of 1@H|pg||
nt|buffytvs: after the original overcall it was hard to put the brakes on|pg||
nt|lml: see I am not sure that everytime you have Hxxxx you should overcall|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I rmember your winning a board in the CWTC final a few years ago by not overcalling on that kind of hand|pg||
nt|lml: I did|pg||
nt|lml: the bridge god put too few pass cards in the bidding box|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: washroom break is over|pg||

nt|vugraphzjp: klimo had 2s bid out, and changed his mind|pg||
nt|lml: notice that North did not overcall|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: 1nt = 9-10, no 4 card major|pg||
nt|lml: well then 1NT would be pretty descriptive|pg||
nt|fabsayc: nope|pg||
mb|1S|nt|lml: north south can make about 2@S|pg||
nt|lml: east west 3@h|pg||
mb|2H|nt|flash: thnx to the CBF and the local tournament committee for organizing this broadcast and inviting us to participate|pg||

mb|2S|nt|buffytvs: and Keith is wondering where the spade suit got to|pg||
nt|lml: South might have bid|pg||
nt|lml: but he didnt|pg||
nt|buffytvs: he certainly might|pg||
nt|buffytvs: and I would have|pg||
nt|buffytvs: he took bids in the other room|pg||
nt|buffytvs: 2 bids|pg||
nt|lml: I would bid again as east with the sixth heart with a non game try 3@H|pg||
nt|buffytvs: me too -- not as West|pg||
nt|lml: lets see if Piotr does the same|pg||
nt|lml: no I am done as West|pg||
mb|3C|nt|lml: Piotr is more ambitious than me|pg||
nt|gambit: if S bids 1S with 4, as they have done consistently, what does the double show?|pg||
nt|lml: I sometimes play the double in Taylor's position shows spades and a minor|pg||
nt|lml: and 1@S shows spades|pg||
nt|gambit: W, no matter how hungry, dcannot accept a game invitation with that crap |pg||
nt|lml: but no secondary minor|pg||
nt|lml: it will be played in 3@H or 3@S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: are you backing that with cokes cam?|pg||
nt|gambit: Buds! even better|pg||
mb|d|nt|lml: I mean he does have 6 spades |pg||
nt|lml: I think Taylor is planning to bid|pg||
nt|buffytvs: c'mon -- at least bet in Canadian beer|pg||
nt|fabsayc: granville island wheat beer|pg||
nt|buffytvs: much better than Bud|pg||
nt|gambit: Steamwhistle|pg||
mb|3H|an|weak|nt|buffytvs: rightly or wrongly|pg||
nt|lml: the double should be forward going|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I'm a Keith's Red fan myself|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I think NS will go on to 3@S and not sell out here|pg||
nt|gambit: You saw the Lexander Keith "spokesman" got arrested for kiddie porn....very sad, and pathetic|pg||
nt|lml: yes|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hearts 2-2 and club hook, game rolls|pg||
nt|lml: me too|pg||
mb|3S|nt|lml: not a measly 5|pg||
nt|buffytvs: so Keith is happy he found a good lead, but he's still on play :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: Taylor led...and Keith is now on play, much to his surprise|pg||
nt|lml: be back in a few minutes.. need coffee break myself|pg||
nt|buffytvs: whoops sorry -- now I need to turn the screen upside down|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: Keiths turn to look at the ceiling for an answer|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: screen is down as taylor is asking campbell is 1d would have been systemic at all|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: so we were right the double by Taylor induced the 3@s bid|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h5|nt|gambit: q@D switch or trump |pg||
pc|hK|pc|h8|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|buffytvs: my guess is down 1|pg||
nt|fabsayc: spade switch looks futil|pg||
nt|fabsayc: futile|pg||
nt|lml: its going to be close|pg||
nt|buffytvs: yes|pg||
nt|lml: he needs to get clubs going I think|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: win this, pull trump ending in S, and run the QH, pitching a D|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|nt|buffytvs: East wins and exits a heart|pg||
nt|buffytvs: west gets in on the diamond and plays a club through -- down 1|pg||
nt|lml: I think the best line is playing on clubs|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|lml: that I think does work|pg||
nt|buffytvs: now the trump exit...|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this looks better still for declarer|pg||
nt|lml: he can make it by giving up two clubs and two diamonds|pg||
nt|fabsayc: on trump shift draw trumps and club|pg||
nt|lml: one diamond|pg||
nt|buffytvs: yes -- setting up clubs is the only chance|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|caitlin: as Korbel tries to trump spade|pg||

nt|lml: West should have bid at least 3@S|pg||
nt|buffytvs: only 15 now|pg||
nt|gambit: 2NT clear|pg||
nt|lml: he cant pass|pg||
nt|lml: well he can|pg||
nt|lml: but he shouldnt|pg||
nt|buffytvs: is there any table discussion?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: whatever it meant campbell should bid over 2s, a strong sequence|pg||
mb|1S|nt|niclecuyer: hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: so we have a new leader -- and don't forget those first 3-4 boards still to compare, which were not good for Gartaganis at this table|pg||
mb|4S|nt|buffytvs: wouldn't surprise me to see exactly the same auction here as in the OR|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|buffytvs: slam here is basically on the heart finesse|pg||
nt|lml: andpass does work out|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: since that fails, they did well to stay out of it|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: not sure what the dbl is by balcombe|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I don't think South will be cooperating with any slam tries anyway|pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: good to see that our suggestion about less of a stagger in starting boards was taken to heart...|pg||
nt|lml: good decision by taylor to pass|pg||
nt|buffytvs: yes -- as Danny Kleinman likes to say, 'balanced hands defend'|pg||
nt|fabsayc: is not so much that i am confident of making as 5@D could have been really ugly|pg||
nt|buffytvs: this should knock 5 more off the lead|pg||
nt|gambit: like the song...no where to run to ...no where to hide|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: 7...it is dbl'd|pg||

nt|gambit: Moosehead? |pg||
pc|h3|nt|fabsayc: like for about 14 hours|pg||
pc|h2|nt|flash: once again, we're starting exactly half the set apart, so we'll have no scores/comparisons until halfway through|pg||
nt|buffytvs: cards I suspect in balancing chair|pg||
nt|buffytvs: might have been the majors, but over a weak NT most would play it as values|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||
nt|gambit: thought he would lead a trump|pg||
pc|dK|nt|niclecuyer: let's hope the scores reflect reality better this time :)|pg||
nt|czyzyk: 2@c shows 2+ clubs, after which E may bid 2@D relay to 2@h or 2@h showing 8-10 with a doubleton @h|pg||
nt|czyzyk: The auction got out of these lines obviously|pg||
pc|d4|nt|vugraphzjp: the inferior 4h game|pg||
pc|d5|nt|flash: Jurek, is 1NT unconditionally forcing by a passed hand?|pg||
nt|buffytvs: unfortunately, we don't have convention cards to refer to|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|flash: (else, not raising directly, even with the weak hand, seems risky??)|pg||
nt|buffytvs: yes, 4@H never makes more than 11 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: keith asked klimo is they lead the kc from the AK|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mittmouse: wolpert should probably know that korbel showed a bad 3 card raise|pg||
nt|czyzyk: No it is not, excludes constr+ raise|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 10 trumps likely, so spade wont do anything|pg||
pc|d6|nt|niclecuyer: This will be a quick play hand for down 1|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dT|pg||
nt|gambit: change e KQJ10 for the A...what a difference|pg||
nt|buffytvs: well, they say aces are undervalued|pg||
nt|gambit: who says that?|pg||
nt|buffytvs: Linda for a start|pg||
nt|buffytvs: she loves aces|pg||
nt|gambit: I love Aces, especially at poker|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: balcombe still staring at his cards|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|pc|cA|nt|bg: W a tad aggressive here  down 1 or 2 depends on locating heart Q|pg||
nt|buffytvs: so with no diamond lead, declarer knows the @HK is offside|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|fabsayc: NEXT!!|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h9|nt|vugraphzjp: then apologized as he saw it in his hand|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|s2|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|nt|czyzyk: may be down 2|pg||
nt|mittmouse: he may go down 2 he only has 6 tricks|pg||
pc|s4|nt|buffytvs: playing a little faster in the othr room, so we'll start to see compares on the first four boards shortly|pg||

nt|gavin:  yes it could never be made on her line|pg||
nt|gavin:  played too quickly is all|pg||
nt|czyzyk: Even if clubs are 3-2|pg||
nt|gavin:  easy to do at this stage of the event |pg||
nt|vugraphzjz: no just very tired|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|starkist: call in the clones|pg||
nt|thurston:  very tough to play all deals for 8 days as the Gartaginis 4 have done|pg||
nt|czyzyk: They played four-handed all the time.|pg||
nt|vugraphzjz: not from sea world|pg||
nt|gavin:  and done very well|pg||
nt|gavin:  they are all great players , and the CNTC is gruelling even 6 handed|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3C|nt|czyzyk: Darren is never tired. He plays better and better when the tournament is going through|pg||
nt|vugraphzjz: he is also younger and younger|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|czyzyk: ;)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|caitlin: :)|pg||
nt|gavin:  darren needs a couple days to clear the cobwebs, since he doesnt play very regularly|pg||
nt|vugraphzjz: 2D 11-16 5-4|pg||
nt|gavin:  this looks to be 1 level too high, if he leads a @H declarer will have a chance to make on a @H guess|pg||
nt|vugraphzjz: 3C min with 5-4 either way|pg||
nt|gavin:  very difficult lead, choosing between the majors|pg||
pc|h2|nt|starkist: seems right to go up|pg||
nt|starkist: for many reasons|pg||
nt|starkist: a. probably not underleading a jack|pg||
nt|starkist: b. can pitch other @h on ace of @s|pg||
nt|gavin:  if declarer guesses correctly (putting up the queen) they can discard their last @H on the K@S and just lose 3@C and 1@D (they dont know about the sure @D loser )|pg||
nt|gavin:  b) applies to both guesses|pg||

nt|niclecuyer: yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: board 18 is a big one|pg||
nt|buffytvs: those contained a grand slam bid here and a small slam not bid -- so lots of scope for IMPs to change hands|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1H|mb|3D|nt|czyzyk: Once the opps bid 2@d E should have 5-7 with 3@h to bid 2@h as in this board|pg||
nt|mittmouse: can e-w get to 6 spades just kidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: same start, but now Judy bid 3@D, I assume a short-suit game try|pg||
nt|buffytvs: and Nick declined|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: short suit game try in OR stopped them in 3H|pg||
nt|buffytvs: if Ross bids 2@S help suit now, Keith might go -- or at least bid 3NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: if taylor has a game try of 2s, they will get too high...|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: you type very fast Ray\|pg||
nt|buffytvs: :)|pg||
nt|buffytvs: EW never bid spades in the OR, and they may not here either|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: any reason to lead clubs on this hand, other than it sets 3@D?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|flash: i've already had a spec suggesting 7@S, George...|pg||
nt|buffytvs: no attractive lead for West here it seems|pg||
nt|buffytvs: heart lead in the OR too|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this lead is right only if partner has heart ace|pg||
nt|buffytvs: they are on Bd 18 right now in the OR|pg||
nt|fabsayc: you dont even have a spot card to protect third round|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|niclecuyer: 3NT seems more likely|pg||
pc|h9|nt|niclecuyer: :)|pg||
nt|bg: EW can make 6 spades without a trump lead|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|buffytvs: watch the scorebaord now as the comares from those first 4 borads start to come in -- could see big movement|pg||
pc|dT|nt|czyzyk: why not 7@s :)|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d6|pc|dK|pg||

pc|d4|pc|d2|pc|d7|pc|dQ|pg||

nt|mittmouse: y u are right 6s is not a great contract but if u were in it u would be forced to make it even on a trump lead|pg||
nt|buffytvs: so Bd 17 is safely by with onyl a 3 IMP loss -- NS made +90 in the otehr room to provide some cover for -200 here|pg||
nt|buffytvs: Now they move to the grand slam deal, Bd18|pg||
mb|p|nt|niclecuyer: I am getting too old to open at UNFAV weak NT, I like safety, confort, TV and strong NT :)|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I have linda watching that one and relaying the proceedings to me|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes, is nice to have a match not over at the 3/4 mark|pg||
mb|1H|an|a\lerted|nt|flash: marginal invite?   partner needs a full 14 and a source of tricks??|pg||
nt|flash: several options at this point - we'd certainly assume that this partnership has an agreement|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|flash: some play Pass shows 'normal' @C holding; XX shows strong @C holding and bids show weak @C holding|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: I am surprised to see that Darren and Dan play the double of 2Cl as clubs, facing a weak NT you can get blown out of the auction if you can'T show cards|pg||
nt|flash: some respond 'normally' to Stayman, promising a @C stopper and Pass without one|pg||
nt|czyzyk: S will bid 2NT now, I believe|pg||
nt|mittmouse: now can he make 2c rdbled i dont think so|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: no he would go down|pg||
nt|gambit: what was 1@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: The auction has started 1@S-2NT, and now they're into relays -- they may well bid the grand now|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|niclecuyer: Well good point, Darren is a passed and I am a moron :)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mittmouse: good bid by klimo|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: murray winning 62-19 in the seniors final|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I wonder whether Eric will go to Philapdelphia and play this Fall?|pg||
nt|buffytvs: Last time he won the Seniors he did not go to the worlds, and everyone kept asking me where he was|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: perhaps JC and John Gowdy can drag him there this year|pg||
nt|buffytvs: and Korbel has indeed bid 7@S on Bd 17|pg||
nt|buffytvs: so that will be a big gain|pg||
nt|lml: so they are pulling away.. which is not entirely surprising in the parts of the set I saw|pg||
nt|buffytvs: with 2 more potential game swings on Bds 3 and 4, these next few minutes could decide what has been up to now a very close match|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: there are the 11 imps now|pg||
nt|fabsayc: has been a long event, 1@D=hearts?|pg||
nt|buffytvs: and they did not bid the grand on Bd 18|pg||
mb|p|nt|niclecuyer: well they found a nice comfortable place to play|pg||
nt|bg: dia best defence here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|niclecuyer: yes still should make at least 2 |pg||
nt|buffytvs: this set has gone to Korbel 27-1 so far, and there may well be more to come|pg||
pc|dA|nt|gambit: i thought 1D was neg (strong club)|pg||
nt|gambit: Q@D|pg||
nt|buffytvs: so that will be a pickup to Gartaginis|pg||
pc|d5|nt|fabsayc: me too but then what is 1H|pg||
pc|d2|nt|buffytvs: and they will likely need to bid the slam on Bd 20 to have chance|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d6|pc|d9|pc|d4|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: sorry, lost play|pg||
nt|fabsayc: normally in precision 1@H rebid would be 19+ balanced or hearts|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and west would rebid 1NT with this strength|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so it looked more like a transfer sequence|pg||

nt|gavin:  the only bright side for EW is that its a very difficult hand and they arent doubled|pg||
nt|starkist: and 3n doesnt make|pg||

nt|niclecuyer: An interesting hand coming up|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: yes declarer played korbel for the spade jack, and found the ten, hence 10 tricks|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: nicely done|pg||
nt|buffytvs: figured out north had the spade length|pg||
nt|buffytvs: so 13 more go away|pg||
nt|buffytvs: 11 rather|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: they might bid this grand after some pretty tough boards in this set...state of the match grand...|pg||
nt|buffytvs: looking at the boards to come, I think Gartaginis has the better scores on 29-32|pg||
mb|1S|nt|vugraphzjp: show up squeeze against north here|pg||
nt|buffytvs: and  Korbel-Wolpert have indeed bid 4@S on Bd 20 so this final score for the set is going to be very one-sided|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: for 7|pg||
nt|buffytvs: if so, then Wolpert-Korbel really need to bid that slam on Bd20 to have any chance|pg||
mb|d|nt|mittmouse: i guess 6d without a s lead|pg||
nt|buffytvs: yes indeed|pg||
nt|buffytvs: can you correct the auction David please?|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|flash: in general, the approach on this side of the pond with a 6-4 hand is to rebid the 6-card suit, unless one holds more than a minimum|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: I don't like 2NT - dangerous with club short (unless they play the switch rebid)|pg||
nt|flash: (6-4 in the majors is an exception)|pg||

mb|p|pc|sA|pc|s5|nt|flash: we'd assume that 3@C by North would've shown a different hand-type|pg||

nt|mittmouse: if they do lead a s which is the only lead to beat it will wolpert know to play a h rather than a c|pg||
pc|sT|nt|buffytvs: Gord has an 18-count opposite a strong NT, so the only real question is 6 or 7|pg||

nt|lml: this is going to work out and maybe he thought he needed it but this auction will not win a prize|pg||
nt|buffytvs: as David pointed out, declarer will cash all his side tricks, and have a show-up squeeze on North in spades and diamonds|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|pg||
pc|hT|nt|buffytvs: on Bd 19, played in 3@H here, NS have reached  a rather tenuous 3@D in the OR and may well record a minus|pg||
pc|h6|nt|lml: actually the squeeze works on either player so it is more like a simple squeeze|pg||
nt|buffytvs: so this should reduce the deficit to a more manageable 33|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h3|pg||
nt|lml: if either players has foud spades and the diamond king they are squeezed|pg||
pc|h9|nt|buffytvs: so that could be a few to Korbel|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hQ|pc|c5|pg||
nt|buffytvs: menahwile if Piotr can make more than 7 tircks here he wins IMPs|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sQ|pc|sK|nt|buffytvs: yes but he knows where the @SJ is -- unless the lead was a falsecard|pg||
nt|caitlin: wd|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|lml: but since north is the finessing hand yes|pg||
pc|hA|nt|buffytvs: looks like 9 tricks I think|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes ruff with nine declarer discards|pg||
nt|val44: I am very far from stopping in 4c|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and coups trumps in endgame|pg||

nt|buffytvs: then declarer would have to guess who had been squeezed if anyone|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not well done at the end|pg||
nt|buffytvs: so I would say 24 IMps looks like being enough with 2 boards to go|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|buffytvs: except that the @DK pops up anyway :)|pg||
nt|buffytvs: we should auction specs that our scores are not official, but the margin is great enough that we probably have the right winner :)|pg||
mb|2S|mb|d|nt|niclecuyer: I love this 1D overcall - gets you in the thick of things early|pg||
nt|lml: this could be a potential win|pg||
mb|r|mb|3C|nt|fabsayc: possible imps here, none on last 2 boards|pg||
mb|3D|nt|mittmouse: how many of u would ocall with s hand and if so what a s or a d|pg||
nt|lml: its on the opening lead|pg||
nt|dannymiles: If South had 4@ss there would be a guess|pg||
nt|buffytvs: club lead is hard to find|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: another possible swing for gartaganis|pg||
nt|buffytvs: but these guys were very good on lead yesterday|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: and again!'|pg||
nt|lml: the designated leader is back|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|lml: there is an argument for the lead of a high card in an auction like this|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|c8|pc|cQ|nt|buffytvs: suddenly they are sitting a ltitle straighter in their chairs...|pg||
pc|cK|nt|lml: if anybody has the @CK it is not likely to be south anyway|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|czyzyk: I would o/c 1@d as Klimo, it leaves more room to investigate|pg||
nt|dannymiles: Amazing. I admit I'd never lead the @cA. Every time I do dummy has @cKQ and @dA or !AQ and I look pretty dumb :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: ruff sluff is irrelevant here|pg||
nt|lml: I like it and not because it is the right one here|pg||
nt|lml: when opponents preempt lead high cards|pg||
nt|lml: so this will be10 to Gartaganis|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sT|pc|s2|nt|flash: i think the @S suit's a tad weak for a 4-card overcall...   i must admit that 1@D probably wouldn't be on my radar screen|pg||
nt|bg: I would overcall 1 dia then bid 1 spade if pard happens to bid hearts|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|mittmouse: i think he is too strong for 2s he should cue bid 2c|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sJ|nt|buffytvs: so after teetering on the brink, Gartaganis has made a big comeback on 2 boards to make it much closer|pg||
nt|lml: and just when they thought this was over .... back they charge|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|lml: these are two very evenly matched teams|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: taylor getting excited that the ks held the trick|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: but will get disappointed very quickly|pg||
nt|buffytvs: just cruelty from West :)|pg||
nt|dannymiles: Next time north will have @sxx @hAQxx @dAQx @cKQxx|pg||
nt|buffytvs: and you needed to lead a diamond, right?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: but then there would be 2 Q@D in the deck Danny|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: David Grainger did that to me several years ago in the Sheardowns (he was playing with Korbel) and I still give him hell for ducking like that and getting me all excited|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: they ended up beating us by a few, and then went on to win the event|pg||

nt|buffytvs: so on this deal West got a low heart lead into the K10, and wasn't in too much trouble thereafter|pg||

nt|buffytvs: all the operators have done very well|pg||

nt|buffytvs: Darrne won the @H10, played @DA, @DJ, and then a club to the 9|pg||
nt|lml: but east west does have their mojo back so lets see|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: sry catch up|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: may not get to 3NT anyway after this start|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: the cards are lying poorly for east west and this could easily go down|pg||
nt|buffytvs: communications are difficult for declarer|pg||
nt|lml: well playing diamonds seems best|pg||
nt|buffytvs: after a threatened rout ony 20 minutes or so ago, the lead is down to 23|pg||
nt|lml: a routette|pg||
nt|dannymiles: Will keep the specs in their seats tonight :)|pg||
nt|lml: a routette is a little rout|pg||

nt|dannymiles: Run the @dJ?|pg||
nt|lml: suppose he plays diamond diamond|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mittmouse: why would korbel pass|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: 2Sp?|pg||
nt|mittmouse: he must have thought 2c was a cue bid|pg||
nt|czyzyk: I believe he took 2@c as equal length pointed suits|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: NS is flirting with disaster here|pg||
nt|mittmouse: but korbel should have dbled 2c and then everything after would be dbled|pg||
nt|flash: i think they're past flirtation and are packing the car for elopement, Nic...|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: flirting can be fun but... not with disaster|pg||
nt|buffytvs: David, which side is playing 3NT here?|pg||
nt|dannymiles: Think our trusty operator missed an initial pass :)|pg||
nt|buffytvs: same contract from the other side|pg||
nt|buffytvs: East played it in the OR and got the @SA lead|pg||
pc|d9|nt|bg: 2 clubs probably is not equal length in spades/dia he would just bid a spade on 3|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mittmouse: actually it sounds to campbell that klimo is showing a very good hand|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: pressure on Darren here, he is probably thinking that Dan did not X 2Cl so must not be that strong|pg||
nt|czyzyk: Klimo is passed hand. Cue by N should be 2@h, 2@c is either natural or equal length pointed suits, according to their agreement|pg||
nt|lml: I thought maybe @DJ to @DK but maybe this will work out|pg||
nt|lml: maybe a club now?|pg||
nt|dannymiles: This is essentially the same position Darren was in, except Darren had a cheap heart trick in and needed South to go up with the spade ace later in the play|pg||
nt|buffytvs: has to really -- diamonds are pretty much dead|pg||
nt|dannymiles: Club to the @c9|pg||
nt|buffytvs: after which South had it beaten pretty much in her own hand|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c2|nt|niclecuyer: 100% Jurek, the only cue was 2H|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cA|pg||

nt|niclecuyer: but 2Cl should natural, with equal length he would have bid 1Sp wouldn't he|pg||
nt|lml: that was my thought and apparently gords|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dA|nt|lml: this is probably okay now|pg||
nt|lml: Gords spades are good enough and he can force out the @CA|pg||

nt|czyzyk: IThis will not be costly, I would be surprised if he happens to make it|pg||
nt|lml: win it in hand and we are home with overtrick|pg||
