mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|lml: hi|pg||
nt|lml: and welcome back|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjq: Both of these teams have won this event before|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: Gartaganis a couple times, and from Korbel's team, Wolpert and Balcombe have won it|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: 2@D is an intersting bid|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h2|nt|lml: it is going to work out fine|pg||
nt|lml: 8 tricks should not be too tough|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|lml: probably 9|pg||

pc|h9|pc|hK|pc|h2|pg||
pc|sT|nt|buffytvs: yes -- aren't you supposed to try to have more trumps than the opps?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: 2d was a xfer|pg||

pc|cK|nt|czyzyk: Did he really do it?|pg||
nt|flash: cutting the lead in half...|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: 1 imps for Korbel here|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c3|nt|lml: back again|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cT|pc|cQ|pc|c4|pg||
nt|buffytvs: niecly done -- they've maneuvered to get South on play to lead a ttrump through|pg||
nt|buffytvs: after which North can claim|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: a diamond for down 4...anything else is down 3|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|lml: these hands arent that easy to defend|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|d4|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d8|pc|d7|pc|d3|pg||

mb|p|nt|lml: thanks for the info|pg||
nt|lml: this is a poor preempt id diamonds|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|lml: at this vulnerability the 3 level seems reasonable with a bit of shape|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|lml: if left alone north south would likely have ended in 4@S|pg||
nt|mcphee: easy to reach 7 on this one|pg||
nt|flash: 4NT with a void in the other room?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: and that  would probable have been fine|pg||
nt|mcphee: key card was ok don't you think?|pg||
mb|4C|nt|mcphee: well once E did not show @C cue|pg||
nt|flash: say it ain't so, Joe...|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|nt|flash: all right - it offends the sensibilities, but it's certainly practical...|pg||
nt|mcphee: 3N serious slam try I expect|pg||
mb|4H|nt|vugraphzjq: And for those who remember, Balcombe and Nick Gartaganis played on the same team together in 2002 in Salt Lake City, when they won the Gold|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: Judy questioning the dbl for the majors|pg||
mb|p|mb|5N|nt|mcphee: uh oh|pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: wouldn't XX show the 1st round control?|pg||
nt|mcphee: they may not find it after no redble|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|nt|flash: perhaps a variation on Paki Blackwood now...   show the void this time|pg||
mb|7S|nt|lml: so probably a push|pg||
nt|bg: How many would double 4 clubs in this sequence? probably gives more info to opps than partner|pg||
nt|mcphee: 6@C odd with void|pg||
nt|mcphee: i would be happy to give them that info|pg||
nt|flash: as Zia tells it, in Paki Blackwood, you ask for aces, then ask again so partner will tell you how many he really has...|pg||
nt|flash: with an odd   of key cards, it's 'std' to jump in the suit which represents the   of aces; with an even   of key cards, 5NT is 'std'|pg||
nt|flash: 10 IMPs on Board 30 - 5@S went down (4@S made here)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cJ|pc|s2|pc|c2|pc|c8|pg||
nt|mcphee: well they got to it, wd|pg||
nt|flash: perhaps West realized his misbid??   this would definitely eliminate the u from my remaining sense of humor|pg||
nt|flash: (the 2nd u)|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s8|nt|flash: i'm told they play exclusion, starting at 5NT|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s3|pg||
mc|13|pg||
qx|c18|st||md|4S3HT5DT63CJT97654,SK9752HAQ987DA72C,ST8HJ632DJ94CAK32,SAQJ64HK4DKQ85CQ8|sv|n|nt|mittmouse: good result for e-w in the closed room|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: yes|pg||
nt|mittmouse: very hard to stop in 2|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: I wonder if he will make 1SP if it gets passed out|pg||
nt|flash: Big Club certainly helped in Closed Room|pg||
nt|buffytvs: so that will eat into the lead somewhat|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: words between EW whether 2d is a transfer or not|pg||
nt|buffytvs: and have EW feeling queasy to start the session|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: klimo put his foot down and that was that|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|lml: this hand can make a lot of tricks|pg||
nt|lml: so I hope their heads are back|pg||
nt|buffytvs: all of them|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: 7s looks very nice|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: even 7d, but i dont think they will bid that one|pg||
nt|buffytvs: 5@C exclusion anyone?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: jacoby 2N anyone?|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|nt|niclecuyer: probably play 3H now|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: or not|pg||
nt|buffytvs: oh|pg||
nt|lml: that is one approach but I prefer going slower|pg||
nt|buffytvs: me too|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|niclecuyer: ooh forget my comment I thought he was gonna bid 2NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: this should play quickly|pg||
nt|buffytvs: can't recommend that bid|pg||
nt|buffytvs: now Piotr is really ging to upset I suspect|pg||
nt|lml: of course I dont normally like to play grands but this one is an exception|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: i only like to play grands when they make|pg||
nt|buffytvs: so this will be a test of partnership nerve -- two bad results to start the set|pg||
nt|lml: without a ruff on the opening lead ....|pg||
nt|lml: you see the last board set up this board|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: no lead yet|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: taylor asking questions now|pg||
nt|buffytvs: tell him it doesnt matter :)|pg||
nt|lml: what questions can you ask on this auction!|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: i will find out|pg||
nt|lml: do you play Blackwood|pg||
nt|buffytvs: whcih page of your system notes is this auction on?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: i think he is asking about the range of the opening bid|pg||
nt|lml: did you pull the right card from the bidding box|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: told 10+ to 17-|pg||
nt|lml: ok|pg||
nt|lml: but you would think they would know that already by this time in this match|pg||
nt|buffytvs: Piotr must have been close to a 1@C opener then|pg||
pc|d3|nt|buffytvs: that would have made a difference probably|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dJ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|mittmouse: i like that pass of a jump shift white i wouldnt pass vulnerable|pg||
nt|lml: I would open it 1@C myseld|pg||
mc|13|nt|lml: myself|pg||
nt|lml: but that may not be their style|pg||
nt|lml: it is a touch quacky|pg||
pg||
qx|o19|st||md|1SK92H873DKQT53C96,SA8764HT9DA986CAJ,S53HKJ654D4CKQ432,SQJTHAQ2DJ72CT875|sv|e|nt|lml: sometimes even ordinary looking boards can have some interest|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|buffytvs: once again they are starting 8 boards apart.|pg||
mb|2S|nt|lml: yes|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I'm starting to think the CBF only has one set of boards...|pg||
mb|3D|nt|flash: so that 6@C showed an odd   of key cards with the void|pg||
mb|d|mb|4S|nt|vugraphzjq: redbl is alerted, but i cant see what it is|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: support, less than limit raise...|pg||
nt|guppy: presumably Nick's passed hand XX = a raise in @s's with one of the top two honours...now the question is how many @c's will Balcombe pull out of the bidding box...|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjq: balcombe bid quick...the delay was the scribbling of the description of the redbl...|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjq: more scribbling by taylor...it looks like he is writing out their entire system regarding this bid...|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjq: 4c showed 6+ clubs and 4 hearts|pg||
nt|buffytvs: maybe someone can suggest that tomorrow they do it the usual way so we can get comparisons much faster|pg||
pc|d4|nt|guppy: hmmmm....I wonder if they were on the same wavelength on this one?  Did Balcombe also alert? |pg||
nt|flash: some play the cue bid to show 3-card support in a limit(+) raise; others either 3- or 4-card support|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dT|nt|vugraphzjq: i think they have different meanings for the 4c bid|pg||
nt|guppy: It's a rather common treatment when the opponents are silent, but quite another thing in a competitive auction...|pg||
nt|lml: so every hand in 3NT|pg||
nt|lml: well 2 out of 2|pg||
nt|buffytvs: never have to say you're sorry,. right?|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: taylor now saying that 4c is huge hand without 4 heaRTS...4C was 100% forcing|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h4|pc|hQ|nt|flash: in the Closed Room, Silver's 3@S call was most likely competitive (and a 3@H call would have shown the limit+ raise)|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|guppy: Taylor bravely takes an action predicated on the possibility that he MIGHT have erred in his interpretation of 4@c |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|lml: cool lead|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: judy might lead a heart back...the dbl may have been lightner'|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: ish|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: plus the 9s at trick one may be pionting to hearts|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s5|pc|sT|pc|s2|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s9|nt|lml: does he have to say he is sorry now|pg||
pc|s6|mc|10|nt|vugraphzjq: or not|pg||
nt|flash: and an overtrick to boot...|pg||
nt|flash: which doesn't change the IMPs|pg||
pg||
qx|c19|st||md|1SK92H873DKQT53C96,SA8764HT9DA986CAJ,S53HKJ654D4CKQ432,SQJTHAQ2DJ72CT875|sv|e|nt|lml: time to get some water|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: klimo just put his hand on the table and all very quietly put their cards back in the board|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|flash: Closed Room playing 24, so we may see some activity on the scoreboard soon|pg||
nt|po-s: will they give comparisons today as opposed to testerday?|pg||
nt|flash: for those joining us along the way, the tables started exactly half the boards apart, leaving us waiting until now for any scores/comparisons|pg||
nt|buffytvs: Gord can't have been worried about the club save at that vulnerability|pg||
nt|lml: he thought .. partner probably cant have enough to make grand with a limited hand|pg||
nt|lml: it would hard to find it all out anyway|pg||
mb|2C|nt|lml: so I will just bid the slam which has to have a play|pg||
mb|2S|nt|buffytvs: not so sure|pg||
nt|lml: you think he wanted to stop opponents from bidding clubs?|pg||
nt|buffytvs: 1@S-4@C; 4@D would have been a pretty good start|pg||
nt|lml: nah|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: that subtle 2c bid, and 2s underbid, might just keep EW out of game|pg||
nt|buffytvs: no not at those coloursa|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|niclecuyer: 2H = good heart raise |pg||
nt|flash: 2@H good raise to 2@S?|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: spade raise|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: I meant|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: y|pg||
nt|flash: the other room used XX to show the high @S honor (ok to lead)|pg||
nt|po-s: who is George talking to?|pg||
nt|flash: or, since we're broadcasting from Canada, honour...|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: oh I hate the bidding but that was the thought process|pg||
nt|lml: now this is a vulnerable game|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lml: it is a but lucky but it will make|pg||
nt|buffytvs: not a great one -- 25% at best|pg||
nt|buffytvs: but it does make...|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dT|nt|flash: avoiding the X|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: 2 imps to Gartaganis|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|buffytvs: so another 'soft' result EW...|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hJ|pc|hQ|nt|niclecuyer: although they have to be careful|pg||
nt|po-s: not yet|pg||
nt|flash: Board 25 in as a push|pg||
nt|mittmouse: i suppose they could get this wrong|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|po-s: the spade 2 is either count, attitude or suit pref|pg||
nt|mittmouse: although i think with 4 spades in the dummy the 2 should be suit preference|pg||
nt|lml: on a non club lead you can try the @H10 and then the @HQ|pg||
nt|lml: so its better than that|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|nt|bg: W made an constructive raise so must have either heart ace or dia ace try hearts first|pg||
nt|flash: i'd think that West's card was suit preference|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h4|pg||
nt|czyzyk: I agree with George, @D 10 is threatening|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|pc|s4|nt|po-s: I agree |pg||
nt|buffytvs: i guess|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: not playing for overtricks, i guess|pg||
nt|lml: I think he might be annoyed again|pg||
nt|buffytvs: he's hoping one of these finesses doesn't work|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c5|pc|c9|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: he may think that because of the 2c bid|pg||
pc|d6|nt|buffytvs: but North had the wrong major king unfortunately|pg||
nt|buffytvs: on such things do championships hang|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: that 2c bid is a huge bid on this hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: EW will never get things right|pg||
pc|c4|pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|buffytvs: partner was a passed hand and the colours were right|pg||
nt|lml: even if game isnt that good it doesnt matter after these 3 boards you have to mentally regroup|pg||
nt|buffytvs: yes -- you feel like you just lost 30+ IMPs in a very tight match|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: club-club gives south a trump promotion here|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d8|pc|s3|pc|d7|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c7|pc|c6|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|buffytvs: and worse -- not so much lost, as threw away... all in the auction|pg||

nt|lml: I told you yesterday I am going to hire Gord to lead for me|pg||
nt|buffytvs: yesterday it was Piotr finding all the double dummy leads|pg||
mb|1S|nt|lml: well you can have Piotr and I will take Gord|pg||
mb|d|nt|buffytvs: fair enough|pg||
nt|flash: at these colors, it's marginally strong for the cue bid|pg||
mb|r|mb|2H|nt|buffytvs: anyone outside Canada will probably not have heard of the EW pair, but these guys are seriously good players|pg||
mb|3S|nt|lml: once I went through a lot of world championship books to look at what won and lost the most imps ... and it was opening leads|pg||
nt|mcphee: to try to locate the 3 level fit with soft suits, not my cup of tea at all|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: they were on the team that won the IOC Grand Prix in 2000, and also the Commonwealth Games title|pg||
nt|lml: okay we are going to send some of those Yanks some of these boards!|pg||
mb|4S|nt|flash: 11 more IMPs on Board 31|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzjq: gartaganis play a strong c...|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjq: not surprised West passed 2nt|pg||
pc|dK|nt|buffytvs: West is not 'SDoubler' but Gord Campbell, by the way|pg||
nt|lml: playing under alias|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: no his bbo name|pg||
nt|lml: ah|pg||
nt|flash: flock led a @D vs 3NT (a @H was led here)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|buffytvs: like Fred Lerner -- idblu|pg||
pc|d5|nt|lml: on the ladies side I want one for Izzy and Sondra Blank.  They are very aggressive penalty doublers|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this is makeable, without cheating what is the line?|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|buffytvs: sorry, IOC was 2002 -- not wearing my Salt Lake shirt right now|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|lml: the double nickname|pg||
nt|buffytvs: yes, but they double partscores that make -- you can have them on your team|pg||
nt|lml: idblu ... doubler... and how about gotcha|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|lml: no they get lots of numbers from nowhere|pg||
nt|buffytvs: meanwhile, back at the table... looks like a routine 4@H|pg||
nt|lml: the lead is helpful|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s7|nt|guppy: Playing their strong 1@c methods, Judy's choice of opening bid essentially valued her solitary @d as an x rather than a K.  Some players wouldn't hesitate to have opened 1N (15-17) ...|pg||
nt|guppy: with her hand as a least of bad alternatives - which would have led to 3N declared from her side - possibly making on a normalish @s x opening lead|pg||

mb|1S|nt|niclecuyer: hi|pg||
nt|po-s: I think West should have played small on the heart|pg||
nt|lml: this is too much fun to miss|pg||
nt|lml: at this point you start wishing you had a yarboro|pg||
mb|d|mb|1N|nt|niclecuyer: I love 1NT...|pg||
nt|buffytvs: no -- I'd rather have a couple of 1NT-3Nt lead and claim deals|pg||
mb|p|nt|mittmouse: korbel will open 1nt as would i|pg||
nt|lml: so does everybody.|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: best way to score stiff Ks|pg||
nt|lml: 4@S not bad|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: K@D lead pretty normal here|pg||
nt|lml: 3@S by campbell?|pg||
nt|buffytvs: pretty good actually, but one of them is going to have to take a push to get there|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: declarer will have to rely on both the spade and club finesses, which both work...|pg||
nt|lml: he just needs one|pg||
nt|buffytvs: just needs the spade finesse for 4|pg||
nt|lml: he can afford to give up 3 offsuit tricks|pg||
nt|buffytvs: or the heart ace onside|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|niclecuyer: they really played 2NT in the other room?|pg||
nt|mittmouse: good dbl |pg||
nt|bg: double may scare off 3nt|pg||
nt|po-s: good says the peeker|pg||
nt|flash: note the Big Club auction in the other room...    1@D opener with the East hand|pg||
nt|mittmouse: wo the dbl he might have led a s against 3nt and now declarer has good chances|pg||
nt|bg: may opt for a moysian fit in spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: they won;t get there now I don;t think|pg||
nt|lml: he can try the club for a heart pitch if he wants|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: and this will be four in a row|pg||
nt|lml: omg  this is painful to watch|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: another opportunity missed|pg||
pc|dK|nt|buffytvs: If I were one of them I would definitely take a washroom break after this|pg||
nt|lml: I think that playing forcing club when partner voluntarily bid 1NT then you should bid 3@S with the West hand|pg||
pc|dA|nt|po-s: declarer might misguess clubs|pg||
nt|flash: it certainly seems as though their stopping was asystemic, though|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|pg||
nt|po-s: it seems like all games depend on club guess|pg||
nt|lml: and I think that in the previous set or the next set Campbell might have done that|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s7|nt|niclecuyer: with the double it seems possible to guess clubs|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sT|pg||
nt|mittmouse: why|pg||
nt|buffytvs: they were very aggressive yesertday in the bidding|pg||
nt|lml: but he isn't really here now|pg||
nt|buffytvs: got to some very tight games|pg||
nt|lml: oddly because when you lose because you underbid you often start to overcompensate|pg||
nt|lml: clearly not the case here|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dQ|nt|niclecuyer: heart length on the right...|pg||
nt|mittmouse: campbell may play a c|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: but diamonds are so bad 5Cl looks like too much|pg||
pc|d3|nt|flash: 5 IMPs on Board 26 - that's the one where the weak raise to 2@H wasn't passed by Wolpert|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|c6|nt|vugraphzjp: campbell staring at the ceiling for an answer|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: and now he just claimed he didnt see the card played|pg||
pc|c9|nt|niclecuyer: key moment?|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cK|pg||
nt|buffytvs: another problem with playing 4-handed is that when a pair has a bad set, you can't let them sit out and regroup|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c2|pc|cA|pc|c5|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s9|nt|po-s: would North double 3H with CK, DA and HK?|pg||

nt|vugraphzjq: Judy is asking what a 3NT opener is|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: Keith : solid major|pg||
mb|1D|nt|guppy: At unfavourable colors, 4@d would be the popular level to preempt with Keith's hand|pg||
nt|flash: thnx to our operator, Medhat Fawzy, for a great job|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: here 4@S is beatable on heart lead|pg||

mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|guppy: will NS find the @c ruff in North's hand to set the contract?  I would bet on them...|pg||

nt|buffytvs: I'm not sure 3NT was intended for play... are you?|pg||
nt|lml: I think it was an offer to play ... in case Piotr had 3@s and a balanced hand|pg||

pc|d2|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this is not the way|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d7|nt|lml: a costly mistake but set up by Keith|pg||

nt|mcphee: a slim lead for the expirienced team|pg||

mb|p|nt|niclecuyer: yes|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|vugraphzjp: 6s or 6n on a non heart lead...|pg||
nt|buffytvs: takes a heart lead to beat a slam here|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: plays much better from the west side|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|flash: bit of an xruff?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: this seems normal and looks like a push at last|pg||
nt|buffytvs: but no-one's interested|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: 2 imp swing on the lead|pg||
nt|lml: dont push when you are in this state|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I|pg||
nt|lml: yes zone 1|pg||
nt|lml: or is it zone 3|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I'd lead a club -- partner had a chance to bid hearts at the 1-level and didn't|pg||
pc|hT|nt|vugraphzjp: and a push|pg||
nt|buffytvs: but that's why I'm sitting here and they're playing a championship final :)|pg||
nt|lml: I like a heart the unbid major and J10x is a nice lead|pg||
pc|h7|nt|buffytvs: if you lead a heart you need partner to have 3 good hearts for tricks and a trick outside|pg||
nt|buffytvs: he might easily have 5 clubs ace or KQ, and that's all you need him to have|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: that lead is not on their card|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|pg||
nt|lml: 5 to the K might be enough|pg||
nt|buffytvs: exactly|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h8|pc|hQ|pc|h3|pg||
nt|lml: no I mean 5 hearts|pg||
nt|lml: but true about clubs too|pg||
nt|buffytvs: with 5 hearts and about an 8-count he might have overcalled|pg||
nt|buffytvs: he couldn't overcall clubs with a weak hand|pg||
nt|lml: his hearts would have been pretty lousy|pg||
nt|buffytvs: KQ98x and a side card? overcall for the lead?  |pg||
nt|buffytvs: I agree it's not cast-iron, but you look for whatever tiny inferences you can get|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: keith did it with his 2c bid a couple hands ago|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: and that was at the 2 level|pg||
pc|c6|nt|buffytvs: yes but I'm assuming that wasn't normal|pg||

mb|p|nt|bg: Hi all|pg||
mb|1N|nt|lml: the forcing club might help them to get to the best spot... 5@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|thurston:  hi bruce|pg||
nt|bg: Hi Paul|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|lml: now Gord should transfer and then maybe ...|pg||
nt|buffytvs: just bid game|pg||
nt|lml: yes|pg||
nt|buffytvs: having limited his hand he can get aggressive now|pg||
nt|lml: well bidding game is rich opposite 0-6|pg||
nt|lml: 0 isnt good enough|pg||
nt|lml: oh you may Gord|pg||
nt|buffytvs: yes :)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|lml: I dont think I would just bid game  ... you do need a fit|pg||
nt|lml: you are missing the AKQJ|pg||
nt|buffytvs: details, details|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: this hand we saw a brilliant discovery play in 3nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: well he did just bid game|pg||
nt|buffytvs: that works too -- Eats has a fine heart stopper|pg||
nt|buffytvs: and Gord has a source of tricks :)|pg||
nt|lml: spades break 4-4|pg||
nt|buffytvs: at least, he hopes it's a source of tricks|pg||
nt|lml: all is good|pg||
nt|lml: but they don't get style points|pg||
nt|lml: you need to get to 5@C to get 10/10 in the bidding contest|pg||
nt|buffytvs: if they lead a diamond, Piotr has to win it, else they can shift to spades in time|pg||
nt|lml: my guess is south will lead a spade|pg||
nt|flash: 'modern' bridge uses the cue bid to show a limit raise (or better) in the opened suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: sigh|pg||
nt|buffytvs: well, that takes the pressure off|pg||
nt|buffytvs: but understandable|pg||
nt|thurston:  ERM will not be impressed with G's dummy|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|guppy: this is a difficulkt hand for NS to restrain themselves from getting too high - at favourable vulnerability Taylor did remarkably well not stepping in immediately over 1@S |pg||
nt|thurston:  even  a hall of famer will be hard pressed to find more thna 7 tricks with foul club lie|pg||
nt|flash: here, North wants to force to game|pg||
nt|bg: some would bid 2nt with S hand not sure if John is allowed to bid NT:)|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s7|nt|fabsayc: after two rounds of clubs, second ducked, how do you proceed|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|flash: (as has been mentioned, probably expecting a bit sounder call in 2nd seat)|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c5|pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|lml: so 10 tricks at least|pg||
nt|lml: and really not much chance for more|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s9|nt|fabsayc: wolpert played a spade to ace and lead diamond jack|pg||
nt|fabsayc: when it was not covered he finessed spades, ran that suit and finessed in hearts|pg||
nt|fabsayc: effectively taking both red finesses to make the hand|pg||
nt|lml: this is a good time to get a beverage|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sA|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c8|pc|cT|pc|s2|pg||
nt|flash: but an immediate 3NT closes off too many possible contracts|pg||
nt|thurston:  ERM has very large hands and one of those will be massaging his own forehead right now|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d3|pc|d2|nt|flash: these are 16-board quarters; we've started with this board to allow the Open Room to have comparisons fairly quickly|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|fabsayc: declarer has the same possibility now|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d6|pc|dQ|pc|dA|pg||
pc|h2|nt|flash: we won't see any changes on the scoreboard until the Open Room has caught up; we won't see any comparisons until we roll over to Board 17|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hQ|pc|h5|pg||
pc|d9|nt|guppy: Although I have the deepest respect for Nick G. (not just as feared bridge opponent but away from the table too), here he succumbed to greed by not passing out the opponents choice ...|pg||
nt|guppy: of his far better minor...|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: he diamond goes on the heart jack and the diamond jack gets ruffed later,|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: players have gone to the bathroom...|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: Andy Stark (creemore) will be the operator for the next few hands|pg||
nt|guppy: The washroom break is very clever partnership management tactics by Nick: he just made a serious blunder, his wife went for a number, and it's time to take a break and regroup so ...|pg||
nt|guppy: that neither of them is dwelling on this when they pull the cards out for the next hand|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|pc|c3|pg||
nt|fabsayc: running the spades wont help him guess which red finesse is working|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h4|pc|h6|pc|hA|pg||

mb|p|nt|lml: I am looking at that hand and thinking is that really an opening bid|pg||
mb|2D|nt|niclecuyer: 5NT now?|pg||
nt|flash: the Closed Room auction might suggest that playing 4-handed is beginning to show?|pg||

nt|niclecuyer: yup no 12th trick|pg||

nt|vugraphzjq: by the way, taylor and balcombe first played together in 1976 at a regional in Kingston|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|bg: another light opener for S|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2C|nt|fabsayc: perhaps he decided to take heart finesse expecting other declarer to finesse in diamonds|pg||
mb|2D|mb|2H|nt|guppy: Labouring as I am without the benefit of their partnership agreements, perhaps Nick's clues to passing Balcombe's 5@c were as follows: (a) she didn't open 1@c, and more importantly ...|pg||
nt|guppy: (b) she didn't XX|pg||
nt|bg: S should pass if you open light best not to freely rebid|pg||
nt|flash: the 5-card major and the 5-5 distribution make this a much better hand than the last one|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|lml: a club lead would work well against 3NT but I dont see how you can find it from the east hand|pg||
nt|buffytvs: Ross really want to have a punt at 3NT|pg||
nt|lml: oh yes he does|pg||
nt|lml: but will he|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: yes  he is playing in his bidding box|pg||
nt|buffytvs: vulnerable with a good 5-card suit -- I say he will|pg||
nt|buffytvs: Colbert's Rule :)|pg||
nt|lml: me too|pg||
nt|buffytvs: look for reasons to bid, not excuses for not bidding|pg||
nt|lml: but 2NT said he had a very good hand|pg||
nt|lml: so its a what the heck bid|pg||
nt|flash: but, at the risk of getting shut out if the opps bid and raise @Ss, i'd pass initially and hope to be able to show my 2-suiter|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: of he was soo disciplined|pg||
nt|buffytvs: discipine wins out|pg||
nt|flash: a @D lead is actually best for the defense, but quite unlikely|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: I think he would have a poretty good shot at 3NT|pg||
nt|lml: yes, I suppose if he was going to bid 3NT he should have just done it in the first place|pg||
nt|buffytvs: even misguessing diamonds there are a lot of chances|pg||
nt|flash: holding long/strong trumps, it's usually right to lead a long suit to try to tap declarer out (have him lose control)|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|pc|d8|nt|lml: a club lead would be tough though|pg||

mb|p|nt|lml: 4@S|pg||
nt|buffytvs: yes -- the ultimate save -- one that makes :)|pg||
nt|lml: this is the type of hand that leads to double game swings|pg||

nt|mcphee: he was in hope of game for sure|pg||
nt|mcphee: 2 will be a struggle|pg||
mb|4C|nt|lml: I think this will be played north south but maybe one too high|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: and Ross is thinking, can he have two black aces and four hearts and I';m cold for 6?|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: 3@H P 4@D cue bid should get this done|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: I think Piotr had to get the diamond bid in to get the save|pg||

nt|buffytvs: tough to judge EW|pg||
nt|lml: good board for Korbel though|pg||
nt|lml: maybe a very good board|pg||
nt|buffytvs: no great distribution and few high cards|pg||
nt|buffytvs: certainly hard to see them losing IMPs here|pg||

pc|s3|pc|sJ|nt|vugraphzjq: discussion re bid meanings |pg||
nt|buffytvs: a 3@D fit jump from East, if available, might do the trick|pg||

pc|sT|nt|lml: yes|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|fabsayc: the % play is two finesses, but here only one entry so take discard and play heart ace|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|buffytvs: but equal colours, it's really hard to see from either hand|pg||

nt|lml: omg!|pg||
nt|lml: 4@D seems a tad high|pg||
nt|lml: and it started off with a lousy overcall of 1@H|pg||
nt|buffytvs: after the original overcall it was hard to put the brakes on|pg||
nt|lml: see I am not sure that everytime you have Hxxxx you should overcall|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I rmember your winning a board in the CWTC final a few years ago by not overcalling on that kind of hand|pg||
nt|lml: I did|pg||
nt|lml: the bridge god put too few pass cards in the bidding box|pg||

nt|vugraphzjp: klimo had 2s bid out, and changed his mind|pg||
nt|lml: notice that North did not overcall|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: 1nt = 9-10, no 4 card major|pg||

nt|lml: cool|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzjq: the last hand nick did not open 1NT, so he was marked to not hold the club queen|pg||

mb|1H|nt|fabsayc: operator, what is this 2@D bid|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mcphee: good 5@D, not so good 5@H:)|pg||
nt|flash: 4-card majors/ACOLish  ??|pg||
mb|2S|mb|4S|nt|buffytvs: in the OR, they found the deadly trump lead against 5@C, and declarer just sort of ran out of tricks|pg||
nt|flash: or just a reasonable choice in 3rd seat??|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjq: not sure, think opening with d|pg||
nt|mcphee: well 3rd seat 4 baggers allowed|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjq: opener|pg||
nt|fabsayc: probably win in hand and finesse diamonds|pg||
nt|bg: no standard 4-5 card major system 4 in 3rd seat|pg||
mb|5H|mb|5S|nt|buffytvs: better judged auction here|pg||
nt|mcphee: best pull this one|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: so a pickup here|pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: in that context, i like the 1@H opener - you'd certainly feel more comfortable if partner led that suit than @Ds|pg||
nt|thurston:  the way to stop a 5level advance: penalty dbl them in 4!|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: exactly Paul|pg||
pc|h5|nt|buffytvs: Judy G. forced to game over the 2@C rebid despite her heart void, and lived to regret it|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mcphee: now they need to beat it|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|fabsayc: yuck|pg||
nt|flash: @HA a reasonable start|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|dA|nt|buffytvs: so this should be about 5 to Korbel|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mcphee: and @C a resonable swithc?:)|pg||

pc|d3|pc|s5|pc|d6|pg||

nt|flash: East might've played his middle @H to avoid any inferences that he wanted a @C switch??|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lml: at this table its just another dull partscore|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hK|pc|s9|nt|thurston:  maybe the heart 3 wasnt the best choice in context|pg||

nt|lml: any suggestions?|pg||
nt|buffytvs: are you thinking ice cream or something stronger?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: a martini?|pg||
nt|buffytvs: several probably|pg||
nt|lml: ice cream ... martini ... ice cream ... martini ... so hard to pick|pg||
nt|buffytvs: they have a lot in common -- hard to have just one|pg||
nt|lml: I think Macdonalds is closed ... does that answer the question|pg||
nt|buffytvs: they never close -- 24/7 up the road from us|pg||
nt|lml: that was figurative not literal|pg||
nt|lml: so far I feel that Korbel has had the best of the set|pg||
nt|lml: it seems like Gartaganis is a bit tired.  What do you think?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: i lost the play it went so slow|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I agree -- but the others are effectively playing 4-handed too, so go figure|pg||
nt|buffytvs: did he make it?|pg||
nt|lml: just put in the result..|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: i will soon|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: gord still thinking|pg||
nt|buffytvs: ah|pg||

nt|lml: east west I mean|pg||
nt|buffytvs: ugh|pg||

nt|flash: 3@D pre-emptive...   would like shortness to go with the 5-card support, but...|pg||

mb|d|nt|buffytvs: is that a Multi overcall do you think?|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzjq: shows 4 s|pg||

mb|3S|nt|lml: next year|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjq: Tay-Bal play Rusinow leads|pg||
nt|flash: the most useful way to play this sequence is to insist that West's call would be supportive of 3NT if East were planning on rebidding 2NT...|pg||
nt|flash: but that's another of my ante-deluvian approaches...|pg||
nt|mcphee: think erm will try 4@H?|pg||

mb|1N|an|11-13|nt|niclecuyer: hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: so we have a new leader -- and don't forget those first 3-4 boards still to compare, which were not good for Gartaganis at this table|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|nt|buffytvs: slam here is basically on the heart finesse|pg||
mb|2S|nt|buffytvs: since that fails, they did well to stay out of it|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: not sure what the dbl is by balcombe|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I don't think South will be cooperating with any slam tries anyway|pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: good to see that our suggestion about less of a stagger in starting boards was taken to heart...|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|flash: once again, we're starting exactly half the set apart, so we'll have no scores/comparisons until halfway through|pg||
nt|buffytvs: cards I suspect in balancing chair|pg||
nt|buffytvs: might have been the majors, but over a weak NT most would play it as values|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|niclecuyer: let's hope the scores reflect reality better this time :)|pg||
nt|czyzyk: 2@c shows 2+ clubs, after which E may bid 2@D relay to 2@h or 2@h showing 8-10 with a doubleton @h|pg||
nt|czyzyk: The auction got out of these lines obviously|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjp: the inferior 4h game|pg||
pc|cK|nt|flash: Jurek, is 1NT unconditionally forcing by a passed hand?|pg||
nt|buffytvs: unfortunately, we don't have convention cards to refer to|pg||
pc|c2|nt|flash: (else, not raising directly, even with the weak hand, seems risky??)|pg||
nt|buffytvs: yes, 4@H never makes more than 11 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: keith asked klimo is they lead the kc from the AK|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mittmouse: wolpert should probably know that korbel showed a bad 3 card raise|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h7|pc|h2|pc|h4|pg||
pc|h9|nt|bg: W a tad aggressive here  down 1 or 2 depends on locating heart Q|pg||

mb|p|nt|fabsayc: 2@D bart or gazilli or similar|pg||
nt|lml: 1@C is strong and artificial and Judy is showing a positive with clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: i think 6@S makes on this deal|pg||
nt|buffytvs: on a turmp lead?|pg||
nt|lml: maybe by ruffing out clubs|pg||

pc|d3|nt|buffytvs: i can see how you might get to 8 tricks, but there's a lot of work to do|pg||
pc|d8|nt|flash: still not enough tricks?|pg||
nt|bg: with this break S should cash heart ace and then figure out what do when leading low to dummy|pg||
nt|mcphee: not really|pg||
pc|d9|nt|lml: it isnt a contract I would want to be in anyway|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|pc|hQ|nt|vugraphzjq: 6@S needs the friendly breaks and yes, probably a non trump lead|pg||
nt|lml: so no fantasies |pg||
nt|lml: in a reasonable spot|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: here they are in 3NT, same as the other table (on a shorter auction)|pg||
nt|lml: I like looking at dummy when it hits and counting 9 top tricks|pg||
nt|lml: it is very relaxing|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: Keith just led out of turn the @S9|pg||
nt|lml: I would accept it |pg||
nt|buffytvs: even behind screens -- lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: Director Bev Ross is telling Judy all her options, |pg||
nt|lml: from Judy's hand it should play better from Nick's side|pg||
nt|buffytvs: Confucius say 'man who lead of turn does not know what to lead -- accept it'|pg||
nt|lml: and a spade lead is hardly frignthening|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: Judy is thinking of accepting and letting Nick play the hand|pg||
nt|buffytvs: out of turn|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: will bbo let me do this?|pg||
nt|lml: that is a good question !|pg||
nt|buffytvs: lol -- it might not -- you might have to change the auction|pg||
nt|buffytvs: there's a thought -- Fred needs to give operators an override for this situation|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: I will wait until  the first trick is played as Nick is now the declarer,  Someoe please tell Fred and Uday we need a new feature on bbo|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: at the other table the spade nine was also led, Wolpert ducked a club, a spade was continued and wolpert went back to clubs and claimed 5|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: just a matter of overtricks if the Defense can find a diamond shift in time|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|h7|pc|d4|nt|mcphee: no shot any more|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||

nt|buffytvs: yes -- now he can duck a spade to East...|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|pc|sQ|nt|vugraphzjq: ah but Nick played diamonds first|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I think Nick's looking for a red suit squeeze|pg||
nt|buffytvs: or a dbl|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: I'll predict an imp goes to the Korbelian Squad here|pg||
nt|flash: West was threatening to get a @S ruff anyway...|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|buffytvs: this will work -- he sets up a club by force, and East will have to break a pointed suit|pg||
pc|s5|nt|lml: yes team Korbel did well on this hand|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lml: I dont think there is a squeeze|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sT|pg||
nt|buffytvs: if he exited the @SQ, declarer would win with the king, then play spades into the safe hand, setting up trick 8|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s6|pc|sK|nt|guppy: On Board  20 in the Open Roon Daniel Korbel did open 1N (15-17) on the hand where Judy ignored her singleton @dK....propelling his side to "touch and go" 5@c that he managed to ...|pg||

mb|p|nt|buffytvs: same start, but now Judy bid 3@D, I assume a short-suit game try|pg||

nt|buffytvs: 5 more boards then he cna take a break|pg||

mb|1D|nt|lml: you remember the hand you said he didnt have to say he was sorry for playing notrump|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: well that cost them 11 imps|pg||
nt|lml: spades was the better spot|pg||
mb|1H|nt|buffytvs: but that's the problem playing 4-handed all week|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|vugraphzjq: The auction began the same way in the other room and Campbell forgot their agreements so they landed in 2@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: that's a general rule, attributed to Michael Schoenborn; there are exceptions|pg||
mb|2S|nt|buffytvs: Keith's offering to play 2@C, but I don't think Ross will want to|pg||
nt|guppy: True - but then Korbel is playing 5-handed and I understand that Balcombe and Taylor to date have played every single board in the event ... so that evens out at this table at ...|pg||
nt|guppy: least|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: Nick|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: s 2@C bid shows clubs, otherwise by a non passed hand would show values|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: Therefore Judy's pass here shows some values by her pass|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|buffytvs: "Being in 3NT means never having to say you're sorry'|pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: time for a stretch, refill, etc...|pg||
mb|4H|nt|lml: I wonder what the difference is between 2@D and redouble|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: redbl is game :)|pg||

nt|lml: Nick was showing clubs ... she wouldnt run on a weak hand|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I agree -- I don't think she would bid very often if at all|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: Klimo in the other room found the jack of spades by running the ten first chance he got, to make his 2 overtricks|pg||
nt|buffytvs: well, the logic is that if West has length in clubs, East is more likely to have spade length|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|sJ|nt|vugraphzjq: avoiding the wish trick|pg||

nt|buffytvs: can East have started with 6 clubs?|pg||

nt|mittmouse: y u are right 6s is not a great contract but if u were in it u would be forced to make it even on a trump lead|pg||
nt|buffytvs: so Bd 17 is safely by with onyl a 3 IMP loss -- NS made +90 in the otehr room to provide some cover for -200 here|pg||
nt|buffytvs: Now they move to the grand slam deal, Bd18|pg||
mb|2D|nt|niclecuyer: I am getting too old to open at UNFAV weak NT, I like safety, confort, TV and strong NT :)|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I have linda watching that one and relaying the proceedings to me|pg||
mb|2H|nt|flash: marginal invite?   partner needs a full 14 and a source of tricks??|pg||
nt|flash: several options at this point - we'd certainly assume that this partnership has an agreement|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|flash: some play Pass shows 'normal' @C holding; XX shows strong @C holding and bids show weak @C holding|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: I am surprised to see that Darren and Dan play the double of 2Cl as clubs, facing a weak NT you can get blown out of the auction if you can'T show cards|pg||
nt|flash: some respond 'normally' to Stayman, promising a @C stopper and Pass without one|pg||
nt|czyzyk: S will bid 2NT now, I believe|pg||
nt|mittmouse: now can he make 2c rdbled i dont think so|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: no he would go down|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: The auction has started 1@S-2NT, and now they're into relays -- they may well bid the grand now|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|niclecuyer: Well good point, Darren is a passed and I am a moron :)|pg||
pc|dT|nt|mittmouse: good bid by klimo|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: murray winning 62-19 in the seniors final|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I wonder whether Eric will go to Philapdelphia and play this Fall?|pg||
nt|buffytvs: Last time he won the Seniors he did not go to the worlds, and everyone kept asking me where he was|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: perhaps JC and John Gowdy can drag him there this year|pg||
nt|buffytvs: and Korbel has indeed bid 7@S on Bd 17|pg||
nt|buffytvs: so that will be a big gain|pg||
nt|lml: so they are pulling away.. which is not entirely surprising in the parts of the set I saw|pg||
nt|buffytvs: with 2 more potential game swings on Bds 3 and 4, these next few minutes could decide what has been up to now a very close match|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: there are the 11 imps now|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|niclecuyer: well they found a nice comfortable place to play|pg||
nt|bg: dia best defence here|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||

pc|d9|pc|d2|pc|d6|pc|d5|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c4|pc|c5|nt|flash: East needed to lead a @H through, instead of returning a trump?|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mittmouse: i am surprised that they play dbl of 2 clubs this way most expert pairs play that dbl as a hand they would dbl a wk nt which is much more practical|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hK|pc|h7|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h9|nt|flash: must've found the @ST as the next play from dummy!!!|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: 130 is a lot of matchpoints on these cards|pg||
nt|flash: (and West didn't cost a trick by ducking the @CK...)|pg||
nt|mittmouse: sorry i am bad about knowing when partner is a passed hand i used to play over wk nt with kokish  transfers by  a passed hand and 2 way stayman by an unpassed hand i would always ...|pg||

pc|hT|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|cK|pc|h8|pc|cJ|pc|c6|pg||
nt|buffytvs: so looks like more IMps to Korbel, but they have to make it yet, which isn't totally trivial|pg||
nt|buffytvs: for sure it Bd 19 will be a swing one way or the other|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: campbell has his head in his hands|pg||
nt|buffytvs: yes -- he's struggling a bit here|pg||
nt|buffytvs: he doesn't know the spade position of course|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: made 4s in the or|pg||
nt|buffytvs: yes -- so 10 more to Korbel|pg||

nt|vugraphzjq: if Gartaganis go on to win by one imp it will be beause Klimo played that spade suit for one loser!|pg||
nt|buffytvs: having won the @SQ, he could have finessed the heart too|pg||
nt|buffytvs: but that's very greedy :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: another 20-20 deal -- who will get NT in fist?|pg||
nt|mcphee: they might bid them all here|pg||
mb|1N|nt|buffytvs: not a bad slam if they can get South on play --|pg||

nt|mcphee: bg has a good eye:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|buffytvs: in the OR, North opened an 11-14 NT, which I confess I would not with hand vulnerable|pg||
nt|buffytvs: But he made 7 tricks so all was well|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: if you play the range you should make the bid|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I guess that's why I don;t then -- I prefer the much more robust 12-14 range|pg||
nt|lml: and besides in all our years of weak notrump only one player ever got us|pg||
nt|buffytvs: only one pair in fact|pg||
mb|5D|nt|lml: obviously a spade lead will defeat 6@D|pg||
nt|lml: yes|pg||
nt|buffytvs: twice|pg||
nt|lml: should we reveal the name|pg||
nt|buffytvs: nah|pg||
nt|lml: they were playing in this event|pg||
nt|mcphee: kinda prefer to open E 1N|pg||
nt|bg: 7 anything except spades|pg||
nt|flash: values too soft for a reverse?   (1NT far too 'modern' for my tastes)|pg||
nt|mcphee: just not my sort of reverse hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: with orth playing it|pg||
mb|5S|nt|buffytvs: without a spade lead it's 75% or so|pg||
nt|lml: if they get there will Judy find it|pg||
nt|buffytvs: you can play a heart up first, then finesse in spades later if that fails|pg||
nt|buffytvs: but not together as a pair|pg||
mb|p|mb|6N|nt|buffytvs: so we need have no fear any more|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: we they are committed to the slam now|pg||
nt|mcphee: partner bids 2N ingberman you have to bid 3@D which looks all wrong to me|pg||

nt|flash: setting @Ds as trumps, so this is Redwood??|pg||
nt|bg: not sure of EW bidding methods from this point on so will just watch and se where they go|pg||
nt|flash: far too esoteric/dangerous for my tastes - over 2@H i bid 4NT...|pg||
nt|mcphee: gee can you do that Jim, invite isn't it?|pg||
pc|sT|nt|buffytvs: with a stiff club in dummy, and a trump lead unattractive, she may well lead a spade |pg||

nt|niclecuyer: nicely done|pg||
nt|buffytvs: figured out north had the spade length|pg||
nt|buffytvs: so 13 more go away|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzjp: show up squeeze against north here|pg||

mb|p|mb|2D|an|gf checkback|nt|flash: in general, the approach on this side of the pond with a 6-4 hand is to rebid the 6-card suit, unless one holds more than a minimum|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: I don't like 2NT - dangerous with club short (unless they play the switch rebid)|pg||
nt|flash: (6-4 in the majors is an exception)|pg||

mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|flash: we'd assume that 3@C by North would've shown a different hand-type|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: but still with club stiff... maybe it was their only way to force|pg||

nt|mittmouse: if they do lead a s which is the only lead to beat it will wolpert know to play a h rather than a c|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: Gord has an 18-count opposite a strong NT, so the only real question is 6 or 7|pg||
mb|3H|nt|niclecuyer: well safe in heaven |pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: Campbell is confused the aucvtion ended|pg||

mb|p|mb|6N|mb|p|nt|vugraphzjp: gord is in the tank|pg||
nt|buffytvs: yes -- and after a set where every decision they have made has been wrong, he has another one to make|pg||
nt|buffytvs: but this time, if he bids on, they will win IMPs|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: he is shaking his head|pg||
nt|buffytvs: this was an odd auction|pg||
nt|buffytvs: it was like his partner suddenyl; got fed up|pg||

nt|buffytvs: All four of these people are really pleasant to play against|pg||
nt|buffytvs: nice manners at the table|pg||
nt|lml: on 20-20|pg||
nt|buffytvs: that's where the lead comes in|pg||
nt|bg: they might if E reverses|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: these boards offered a lot of opportunities for big swings|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but janicki would have needed to get them all right|pg||
nt|lml: that bid gives Taylor a problem|pg||
nt|buffytvs: For anyone who doesn't know him, you can follow Ross Taylor's blog on www.bridgeblogging.com|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: 2@C may also have a 4-card major|pg||
nt|buffytvs: he writes about poker as well as bridge -- and very well too|pg||
nt|buffytvs: a sketchy 3NT here, that really needed the diamonds to come in for some tricks|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mcphee: joey will open 1N|pg||
nt|flash: missed a pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: you hate passing but there is always next round|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I don't think Keith will pass\|pg||
nt|lml: Balcombe will make it easy now|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: 2@C also shows 2 of top 3 honours, or 3 of top 5|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: ok i know what 2@D was now|pg||
nt|lml: Nick is not going to take this too far|pg||
nt|buffytvs: so how high will they go?  Par looks to be 5@S making NS|pg||
nt|lml: do you remember the 3NT down 2 early on with the 6-5 red suit hand|pg||
nt|lml: it was a push|pg||
nt|buffytvs: in 4@S or 3NT?|pg||
nt|lml: North opened 2@H at both tables|pg||
nt|buffytvs: that was Bd 21|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: yes|pg||
nt|flash: and this was the latest test in the 'au courant' bidding contest...|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: or rather 4@S making 5|pg||
pc|d6|nt|lml: the score for the half on compared boards at this time is 17-16|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I see Judy found a raise to 3@H and Darren was endplayed into bidding 3NT|pg||
nt|mcphee: do not lead @D|pg||
nt|bg: better lead a club|pg||
nt|flash: cash the @Cs for down 1...   not today|pg||
nt|mcphee: oh well:)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|fabsayc: in precision system, the 1@D opening is ambigous as to length|pg||
nt|lml: 4@C is too high|pg||
nt|lml: thats 500|pg||
nt|lml: 5@H|pg||
nt|flash: i can make a case for treating this as similar to leading against a gambling 3NT - |pg||
pc|d2|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I like the call though|pg||
nt|buffytvs: so that one is safely scored up as far as Gartaganis is concerned, and now they have to worry about 24|pg||
pc|dK|nt|buffytvs: pushed them to the 5-level|pg||
nt|lml: yes it is low cost way to get them up|pg||
pc|d8|nt|lml: but its enough now!|pg||
nt|buffytvs: Ross doesn't believe the 5-level belongs to the opponents, obviously|pg||
nt|lml: now they have to guess diamonds|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: Keith will need to find the @DQ, does he play Nick who holds 4 or Judy who opened the bidding?|pg||
nt|buffytvs: as long as the defence ruffs out the @C10|pg||
nt|lml: you can go either way |pg||
pc|c7|nt|lml: well I guess east wanted a diamond lead but he wasnt getting one|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|fabsayc: we use to play 1@D followed by 2@C showed real clubs, not necissarily diamonds|pg||
pc|s9|nt|buffytvs: he knows Judy has about 10 cards in the round suits...|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: yes good point|pg||
pc|sT|nt|fabsayc: so there is a need for a way to show primary diamonds, and that is the 2@D opening|pg||
nt|lml: he will think about it a while|pg||
nt|flash: the @CK is unlikely to be on your right; maybe lead the A and see dummy...   (and see that you've given up 5 tempi and the contract|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|bg: my mother always told me to lead aces vs preempts and she didnt play bridge|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lml: they are moving in to worse contract here|pg||
nt|buffytvs: this can't be thinker for East surely?|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hQ|pc|h5|pg||
nt|buffytvs: well I think we can safely say that EW are going plus here|pg||
nt|lml: well they landed somewhere that east-west can beat|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lml: West knows where the @SJ is so one presumes he is thinking about what to do later in the hand|pg||
pc|h2|nt|vugraphzjq: they are short for time|pg||
pc|h7|nt|buffytvs: beating it 1 is not a problem -- beating it more may be tougher|pg||
nt|buffytvs: playing hearts might work out best for the defence|pg||
nt|lml: I think this is likely one down|pg||
nt|lml: but it is complicated|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|s3|pc|c6|nt|buffytvs: how long do they have left?|pg||
nt|lml: I am going to guess he will get it wrong|pg||
nt|lml: invoking the commentator's curse rule|pg||
nt|lml: if he gets it wrong Judy will have won the board|pg||
nt|buffytvs: Keith's  a very good declarer -- don't bet against him|pg||
nt|lml: its not that|pg||
nt|lml: its that Nick has the diamond length clearly|pg||
nt|buffytvs: yes -- but this is almost a table feel thing|pg||
nt|lml: and there is enough for him to hold a queen|pg||
nt|buffytvs: he does hold a queen :)|pg||
nt|lml: Judy wouldnt value the heart queen|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|lml: diamond queen|pg||
pc|cA|nt|lml: that works fine for the defence|pg||
pc|c8|nt|buffytvs: nobody's going to throw a diamond and help him|pg||
nt|lml: the high heart might have helped though|pg||
nt|buffytvs: if you blieve it :)|pg||
nt|lml: now it looks like Nick has the @HQ|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: yes when the D has the declarer booked, all bets are off|pg||
mc|10|pg||

nt|niclecuyer: mean guys |pg||
nt|buffytvs: then declarer would have to guess who had been squeezed if anyone|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|buffytvs: except that the @DK pops up anyway :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|niclecuyer: I love this 1D overcall - gets you in the thick of things early|pg||
nt|lml: this could be a potential win|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mittmouse: how many of u would ocall with s hand and if so what a s or a d|pg||
nt|lml: its on the opening lead|pg||
nt|dannymiles: If South had 4@ss there would be a guess|pg||
nt|buffytvs: club lead is hard to find|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: another possible swing for gartaganis|pg||
nt|buffytvs: but these guys were very good on lead yesterday|pg||
pc|cA|nt|buffytvs: and again!'|pg||
nt|lml: the designated leader is back|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c4|nt|lml: there is an argument for the lead of a high card in an auction like this|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cQ|pc|cK|nt|buffytvs: suddenly they are sitting a ltitle straighter in their chairs...|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|lml: if anybody has the @CK it is not likely to be south anyway|pg||
pc|c6|nt|czyzyk: I would o/c 1@d as Klimo, it leaves more room to investigate|pg||
nt|dannymiles: Amazing. I admit I'd never lead the @cA. Every time I do dummy has @cKQ and @dA or !AQ and I look pretty dumb :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: ruff sluff is irrelevant here|pg||
nt|lml: I like it and not because it is the right one here|pg||
nt|lml: when opponents preempt lead high cards|pg||
nt|lml: so this will be10 to Gartaganis|pg||
pc|h4|pc|c9|pc|s3|pg||
nt|flash: i think the @S suit's a tad weak for a 4-card overcall...   i must admit that 1@D probably wouldn't be on my radar screen|pg||
nt|bg: I would overcall 1 dia then bid 1 spade if pard happens to bid hearts|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mittmouse: i think he is too strong for 2s he should cue bid 2c|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sK|nt|buffytvs: so after teetering on the brink, Gartaganis has made a big comeback on 2 boards to make it much closer|pg||
nt|lml: and just when they thought this was over .... back they charge|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|lml: these are two very evenly matched teams|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: taylor getting excited that the ks held the trick|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: but will get disappointed very quickly|pg||
nt|buffytvs: just cruelty from West :)|pg||
nt|dannymiles: Next time north will have @sxx @hAQxx @dAQx @cKQxx|pg||
nt|buffytvs: and you needed to lead a diamond, right?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: but then there would be 2 Q@D in the deck Danny|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: David Grainger did that to me several years ago in the Sheardowns (he was playing with Korbel) and I still give him hell for ducking like that and getting me all excited|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: they ended up beating us by a few, and then went on to win the event|pg||
nt|dannymiles: Ahh you can then call the director and have the board thrown out :)|pg||

nt|vugraphzjq: thank you|pg||
nt|fabsayc: finals start tomorrow at too early an hour for me, continue on saturday|pg||
nt|lml: the double game swing hand .. yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: 6@S isnt a bad spot here|pg||
mb|1N|nt|buffytvs: and here's a magic fit slam|pg||
nt|lml: so a swing chance|pg||
nt|flash: shudder...   i thought that might be West's choice...|pg||
nt|mcphee: looks best really|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: i think he should have played more spades -- cannot cost, and in fact he gets an inteersting piece of information|pg||
mb|2C|nt|buffytvs: There's a deal in 'Bridge behind Bars' like that|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: 2@H could be up to 11(ish) HCPs|pg||
nt|lml: as you can see this is a good score for the dark blue team|pg||
nt|buffytvs: the strong clubbers couldn't get there -- let's see whether 2/1 can do it|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: seems very unlikely|pg||
mb|2D|nt|lml: I guess they bid 3@D with both majors and longer diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: Declarer knows South is 4-0 or 0-4 in the mnajors, and needs to find the @SQ|pg||
mb|3N|nt|buffytvs: he runs everything and forces South to discard a heart, after which he can play North for the @SQ|pg||
nt|lml: we may be ducplicating the result though|pg||
nt|lml: so he is trying for the slam|pg||
nt|buffytvs: costs nothing|pg||
nt|lml: but Ross wont love his spade suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: Ross will hate his trumps but like his controls|pg||
nt|lml: 4@C is a good bid for Keith|pg||
nt|lml: they could get there|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: but Ross is bid out,,, its really up to Balcombe|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I think they will|pg||
nt|buffytvs: but he has to go now -- biding 4@D isn't going to get him anywhere, and he knows that|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: no Nick wont pass a taekout double and he didnt|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: smooth pass from KB|pg||
nt|lml: Balcome likes clubs!|pg||
nt|lml: if he bids 4@D then Ross will just sign off I would think|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lml: I dont see how Ross can bid any more than 4@S|pg||
pc|h8|nt|buffytvs: ohh|pg||
nt|lml: its okay... it doesnt matter|pg||
pc|h9|nt|lml: its a little birdy hand cheep cheep cheep|pg||
nt|buffytvs: ah yes-- didn't see the result in the other room|pg||
nt|mcphee: up to 8 tricks now|pg||
nt|flash: the @HQ would have saved a trick, but there's absolutely no reason not to lead low here...|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|dA|nt|buffytvs: he has to but then Keith will know there's no @HK opposite|pg||
nt|lml: he was endplayed|pg||
nt|mcphee: in a way the play is a bit easy|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d3|nt|lml: tough auction |pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|lml: I see your point though|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d7|nt|mcphee: you can not really afford to discard @S on @D|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|fabsayc: usually 1nt bidder has clubs|pg||
nt|buffytvs: yes, but I'm trying to put 13 points in the south hand (4432) which don;t give him a play for slam|pg||
nt|flash: perhaps, but that wasn't the winning choice...|pg||
nt|mcphee: so you will lead a @S up to the K and claim|pg||
nt|flash: just give up 2 @C tricks??|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cQ|nt|mcphee: low @C to 9?|pg||
nt|bg: cute hand W can win heart ten play 3 rounds of dia conceding queen but later squeezes himself on the run of dia N has to keep AQX in clubs|pg||
nt|mcphee: you are right bruce|pg||
nt|bg: academic now no play|pg||
nt|flash: i also don't understand not overtaking there?|pg||
nt|flash: the threatened 17 IMPs have appeared for Board 25|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c2|pg||
nt|buffytvs: haven't been able to yet|pg||
nt|lml: since Taylor did not cuebid hearts it suggests his points are elsewhere|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|buffytvs: right -- so which 13 with no @HK would be bad?|pg||
nt|lml: so a lost opportunity|pg||
pc|hA|nt|flash: well...|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sA|nt|buffytvs: interesting that Nick pulled the double -- Larry Cohen says that you shouldn't pass low-level doubles just because you have four trumps -- you need good spots, which Nick didn't ...|pg||
nt|buffytvs: have|pg||
nt|lml: I hate playing these hands but Nick is actually winning imps|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s5|pg||
nt|fabsayc: however south knew his partner had values, and the only hand that would get shut out by 1D opening would be with clubs|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hK|nt|lml: the double was takeout and that meant Judy was likely to be short in spades|pg||
nt|lml: he might have taken the safe bid of 3@H knowing Judy had 5|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|flash: we might even be able to retire on the proceeds for quashing the tape of this set...|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|lml: I think he was hoping she would pull to hearts if she didnt have abetter club fit|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|nt|bg: now he makes Eric asleep at switch squeeze doesnt exist anymore|pg||
pc|s3|nt|buffytvs: yes -- Darren didn't know his partner had 5 hearts, and North had already bid clubs, so maybe he was endplayed into passing the double|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|c3|nt|fabsayc: so an initial club lead would have been quite logical and made this interesting|pg||
mc|10|nt|mcphee: what a hand:)|pg||
nt|mcphee: brb|pg||
pg||
qx|c31|st||md|1SAQ764H9742D2C872,SK8HKT5DAJCKJT654,S95HQJ63DQ654CAQ3,SJT32HA8DKT9873C9|sv|n|nt|niclecuyer: this one will end up in 2NT by W I believe|pg||
nt|buffytvs: so on this deal West got a low heart lead into the K10, and wasn't in too much trouble thereafter|pg||
nt|lml: and campbell opened 1@C|pg||
nt|dannymiles: Not such an easy hand on a heart lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: taylor passed surely|pg||
mb|3N|nt|niclecuyer: 1NT - 2D - 2H - 2NT of something like it...|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|niclecuyer: don't they play weak NT?|pg||
nt|mittmouse: no|pg||
nt|caitlin: Danny is on the Korbel team in case you didn't notice:)|pg||
nt|dannymiles: Two boards to go...An interesting 3NT followed by what should be a flat 5@c (or 3NT)|pg||
mb|p|pc|d4|nt|niclecuyer: oh sorry I thought so|pg||
nt|buffytvs: Darrne won the @H10, played @DA, @DJ, and then a club to the 9|pg||
nt|lml: but east west does have their mojo back so lets see|pg||
nt|vugraphzjp: sry catch up|pg||
pc|dT|nt|buffytvs: may not get to 3NT anyway after this start|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dA|pg||
nt|lml: the cards are lying poorly for east west and this could easily go down|pg||
nt|buffytvs: communications are difficult for declarer|pg||
nt|lml: well playing diamonds seems best|pg||
nt|buffytvs: after a threatened rout ony 20 minutes or so ago, the lead is down to 23|pg||
nt|lml: a routette|pg||
nt|dannymiles: Will keep the specs in their seats tonight :)|pg||
nt|lml: a routette is a little rout|pg||
nt|lml: I guess that makes me a bridgette|pg||
nt|buffytvs: don't  get me started on the short jokes...|pg||
nt|lml: remember who you have to go home with|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I'm already home|pg||
nt|caitlin: lol:)|pg||
nt|dannymiles: What will declarer do? Bang diamonds from the top? Play a club to the 9?|pg||
nt|dannymiles: Run the @dJ?|pg||
nt|lml: suppose he plays diamond diamond|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mittmouse: why would korbel pass|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: 2Sp?|pg||
nt|mittmouse: he must have thought 2c was a cue bid|pg||
nt|czyzyk: I believe he took 2@c as equal length pointed suits|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: NS is flirting with disaster here|pg||
nt|mittmouse: but korbel should have dbled 2c and then everything after would be dbled|pg||
nt|flash: i think they're past flirtation and are packing the car for elopement, Nic...|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: flirting can be fun but... not with disaster|pg||
nt|buffytvs: David, which side is playing 3NT here?|pg||
nt|dannymiles: Think our trusty operator missed an initial pass :)|pg||
pc|d5|nt|bg: 2 clubs probably is not equal length in spades/dia he would just bid a spade on 3|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mittmouse: actually it sounds to campbell that klimo is showing a very good hand|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: pressure on Darren here, he is probably thinking that Dan did not X 2Cl so must not be that strong|pg||
nt|czyzyk: Klimo is passed hand. Cue by N should be 2@h, 2@c is either natural or equal length pointed suits, according to their agreement|pg||
nt|lml: I thought maybe @DJ to @DK but maybe this will work out|pg||
nt|lml: maybe a club now?|pg||
nt|dannymiles: This is essentially the same position Darren was in, except Darren had a cheap heart trick in and needed South to go up with the spade ace later in the play|pg||
nt|buffytvs: has to really -- diamonds are pretty much dead|pg||
nt|dannymiles: Club to the @c9|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cQ|nt|niclecuyer: 100% Jurek, the only cue was 2H|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c2|pg||
nt|flash: they can actually escape for down 1, but...|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: but 2Cl should natural, with equal length he would have bid 1Sp wouldn't he|pg||
nt|lml: that was my thought and apparently gords|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sJ|nt|lml: this is probably okay now|pg||
nt|lml: Gords spades are good enough and he can force out the @CA|pg||
nt|dannymiles: Duck the spade?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lml: diesnt help|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|dannymiles: This should make|pg||
nt|lml: doesnt|pg||
pc|h4|nt|niclecuyer: will probably escape for down 1 |pg||
nt|flash: @DK??|pg||
nt|czyzyk: IThis will not be costly, I would be surprised if he happens to make it|pg||
nt|lml: win it in hand and we are home with overtrick|pg||
nt|dannymiles: North needed to avoid playing a spade|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mittmouse: good pass by wolpert and an even better non j of h lead|pg||

nt|mcphee: ok eric the sun is shinning on you now:)|pg||
nt|flash: and avoid this|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: I knew it|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: this will go down|pg||
nt|lml: it means never having to say you are sorry|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: 2@D showed fewer than 3 hearts|pg||
nt|lml: he might well|pg||
nt|buffytvs: why will it go down?|pg||
nt|lml: he has to guess diamonds|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: he is bound to get the diamonds wrong|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: with the X|pg||
nt|lml: Judt doubled |pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: if it goes down it is the curse of the diamond queen for Bal-Tay|pg||
nt|starkist: rather make a short suit game try|pg||
nt|mcphee: gin|pg||
nt|flash: board 27 in as a push|pg||
nt|mcphee: xfer to @C then show short @S another popular wat|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: we are so on the same wavelength Nick|pg||
nt|buffytvs: no -- this time he'll play her for it -- won't get caight twice :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: different declarer so perhaps |pg||
nt|buffytvs: he's either laughing or cursing to himself right now|pg||
nt|lml: I think he will get it right|pg||
nt|lml: so with 1 compare to compare it is 25 imps to 34 imps in this set|pg||
nt|lml: so very tight|pg||
pc|dT|nt|lml: very well played bridge|pg||
nt|buffytvs: Australia's Ian McCance, who wrote a book of defensive problems for us, thinks 4@S is in jeopardy.  Let's see...|pg||
nt|lml: that lead cant hurt|pg||
nt|buffytvs: right|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|lml: maybe without a diamond lead|pg||
pc|d7|nt|lml: but it isnt clear at all|pg||
nt|lml: did Judy really block spades?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: yes the spades were played that way!|pg||
nt|lml: not good|pg||
nt|buffytvs: doens't matter though|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: yes but he won't matted|pg||
nt|buffytvs: not enough tricks if he gets diamond wrong without playing on clubs|pg||
nt|lml: good point|pg||
nt|buffytvs: but it wasn't a good play|pg||
nt|lml: it was a tired play|pg||
nt|buffytvs: that's the second time we've said that- and there are 6 sets left in this final|pg||
nt|lml: well it is the last board of the set|pg||
nt|buffytvs: the good news is that they have started the last board, so time is not an issue any more|pg||
nt|lml: that is when you can easily lose concentration|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: surely with AQJx the ace is right?|pg||
mc|11|nt|buffytvs: this is the last board today, which brings us to half way, and very little in it between these two teams,|pg||

mb|1S|mb|2C|nt|niclecuyer: hard hand to defend |pg||
nt|buffytvs: I like a simple 4@S by South once partner has overcalled|pg||
nt|buffytvs: at these colours|pg||
nt|lml: a LAW bid|pg||
nt|buffytvs: yes, I'd lie to have a singleton, but so what...|pg||
nt|buffytvs: like|pg||
nt|lml: Larry would be proud of you|pg||
nt|buffytvs: blush|pg||
mb|4S|nt|buffytvs: yes!!|pg||
nt|buffytvs: a man after my own heart|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: so Taylor can be on Ray's teeam|pg||
nt|lml: but East is not selling here I wouldn't think|pg||
nt|buffytvs: sure can|pg||
mb|5C|nt|buffytvs: of course not|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: so science or art it all gets you to the club game|pg||
nt|buffytvs: and the play will not take long|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mittmouse: wow my rule for opening balanced 12 counts is that i have an easy bid when partner makes a co-operative dbl  this is an example of exactly that problem|pg||
nt|buffytvs: well folks, that was fascinating set at this table|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|nt|lml: no once you bid it then there was no more to do|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|buffytvs: thx to all my fellow commentators, and to our operator David|pg||
