nt|buffytvs: A good result for EW in the other room here I think -- that's a pretty thin game|pg||
mb|1H|nt|mich-b: of course the traditional approach is not to preempt with a side 4 card major|pg||

nt|hedyg: pass pass 1@s|pg||
nt|hvdhaar: Hi all|pg||
nt|hedyg: i doubt that he played the @hs that way|pg||
mb|p|nt|mich-b: A "disciplined" action by Drijver - not opening 3@C , like some players would do , convinced by the vulnerability|pg||
nt|lestergold: exactly thatb sort of hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: can make 5@c NS|pg||
nt|hedyg: Bob undo pls|pg||
nt|hedyg: multi 2@d|pg||

nt|hedyg: Fantoni doesnt like it|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S hoping for 1255|pg||
nt|jcwla: Many would use something like 3@D by E to show a LR in @S.  3@S often just shows a max single raise.|pg||

nt|marlowepi: hard to lead a D, and with clubs 22 doesnt matter|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes Jordan i am surprised by the 3@s bid too|pg||
nt|jcwla: It's pretty much implicit that S has to have some fit for one of the minors here.  Probably not trotting out 4@H for the first time without the ability to go to 5m as needed.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i mean after one spade|pg||
nt|pelu: what would u bid? - 3@S NF - they can use 3@c and 3@D as fircing/invitational bids|pg||
nt|marlowepi: defense has a chance on spade out and diamond shift|pg||
nt|hedyg: sure they can|pg||

nt|marlowepi: your hand is very well suited to defense, you have no guarantee of a fit, and you are vul. more to lose than to gain by bidding, IMO. it is not as if clubs rates to be a live suit ...|pg||

nt|hedyg: isn't that very dangerous?|pg||
nt|lestergold: depends which heart nour played first|pg||
nt|lestergold: honour|pg||
nt|lestergold: morelikely to play overfcaller forv short heart|pg||

nt|lestergold: not possible surely Bob|pg||

nt|vugraphzgq: He does|pg||
nt|hedyg: this is a very tough board to play|pg||
nt|hedyg: but...........it is tough at both tables|pg||
nt|sybarra: as I said at beginnig the transportation is extremely diffcult |pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mich-b: without the double declarer might have tried to duck a @S from both hands|pg||

pc|h4|nt|hedyg: camouflaging the J@H?|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: mistook it for 2@D?|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think jansma not guesses hts |pg||
nt|lestergold: just pulled wrong card as we all do sometimes?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: will be easier now|pg||
nt|hedyg: back comes a @H now?|pg||
pc|h7|nt|hedyg: difficult now|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lestergold: still has a decision|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Did seem fairly intentional|pg||
nt|hedyg: much harder now|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: But perhaps|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: attempted Grosvenor, my favourite|pg||
nt|lestergold: well im told that the lord gave us singletons to lead them for a ruff|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree Mike!!!|pg||
nt|hedyg: the Lord bothers with bridge?|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes Hedy,  cant you tell?|pg||
nt|hedyg: no :(|pg||
nt|lestergold: how did south think this contract wa going off without pard holding A@d|pg||
nt|sybarra: has not alternative but 9 does he?  would S lead from xx in H!?|pg||
nt|hedyg: would he lead from Jxx???|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: are they internationals :)|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|hedyg: right!|pg||
nt|lestergold: thats why he is in tank he cant work it out because it was not exactly a marked defence|pg||
nt|pelu: 26 HCP + solid stoppers - but still almost no play for 3NT|pg||
nt|hedyg: if Nunes knew where the 10@d is he could have exited in @d|pg||
pc|sA|nt|sybarra: Jan Jan Jan!!!|pg||
nt|lestergold: the lord has come to iceland's rescue- Grovesnor by m,istake|pg||
pc|s7|nt|hedyg: i think that was a very clever move by Jonsson who obviously did not believe his pd had A@d|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|kiwibridge: GRosvenor works, gets his trump trick back :) Victory|pg||
nt|hedyg: rather took pd for K@c and A@D in W|pg||
nt|hedyg: remember that Jansame took the 1st trick with A@c|pg||
nt|hedyg: Jansma*|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|hedyg: ok now he knows the K@D is in S|pg||
nt|hedyg: N would have taken it|pg||
nt|pelu: even DD difficult to find a good plan|pg||
pc|s2|nt|hedyg: A@H and @H looks safe enough|pg||
pc|d8|pc|s9|pg||

mb|2D|an|!|nt|buffytvs: I'm surprised East passed 1NT here|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: no finesse required|pg||
nt|hedyg: hmmm is 4@H enough here?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: seems a lazy 4@H bid hedy|pg||
nt|hedyg: N is obviously short in @s|pg||
nt|hvdhaar: Agree, first DBL (take-out) and then 4 H looks better|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: pressure on N|pg||
nt|hedyg: EW CC: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/May/OpenTeams/netherlands/muller-dewijs.pdf|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mich-b: reasonable 6@C here for NS|pg||
nt|hedyg: the optionwas to open 1@d and rebid 2@c|pg||
nt|marlowepi: even without a club stopper Ralf? :)|pg||
mb|d|nt|kiwibridge: indeed there was|pg||
nt|sybarra: looks an easy 4 @S |pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: this is a potential disaster -3 if passed|pg||
nt|hedyg: Baldursson : they always bid my doubelton when i double!!!|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: when 60 down, might you think of more?|pg||
nt|hedyg: doubleton*|pg||
nt|lestergold: could have shown a good 5@d bid by first bidding 4n then correcting 5@c to dims but i dont think north would have bid 6 even then |pg||
nt|hedyg: NS CC: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/May/OpenTeams/iceland/jonsson-baldursson.pdf|pg||
nt|sybarra: or rebid 3 @C ,  but light for that |pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Nunes passed X's to Jansma|pg||
nt|pelu: better pass to 2@D - and take 7x@h against 3NT|pg||
mb|3C|nt|mich-b: but getting 1100 here will be almost as good perhaps|pg||
nt|jaapfr: you believe other room 6@C bid?|pg||
nt|mich-b: note Fantoni's pass , on the strength of his @H10|pg||
nt|hedyg: lolllll|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|hedyg: S is definitely too good for a 3@c bid and how else to get to 6@c?|pg||
nt|hedyg: would that not have shown 2 places to play ?|pg||
nt|hvdhaar: South has to bid a grand now ... N|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: EW play Tarzan Precision wow sounds exciting|pg||
nt|hedyg: NS play Ice-relay precision|pg||
mb|3H|nt|sybarra: now gets the chance to take 7 tricks |pg||
nt|hedyg: K@H lead?|pg||
nt|sybarra: S is on lead |pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: in a good hand|pg||
nt|pelu: S on lead|pg||
nt|hedyg: maybe Jansma could have bid 3@H|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: crazy 3NT there's no sense to it|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes with some hesitation - if 1@c is conventional|pg||
nt|czyzyk: Will N bid according to Colbert's rule here :)|pg||
nt|buffytvs: got to be tempting for North to bid on here|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|mich-b: no, i dont think other room will reach 6@C , but thats not impossible|pg||
nt|jaapfr: you rite -1100 more likely|pg||
nt|mich-b: the way to get to 6@C , is for South to double, North to show values via Lebensohl, and South to complete the description by bidding @Cs , going past 3NT|pg||
nt|hedyg: need to remove the @c ruff|pg||
nt|hedyg: for most players 2NT would be weak|pg||
nt|hedyg: (lebensohl)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: quess @HJ or @S9|pg||
nt|hedyg: Fantoni knows that Nunes does not have the J@s|pg||
nt|jaapfr: @DJ mb too DD|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: they'll be pushing to finish before the next scheduled start time|pg||
nt|hedyg: so playing @s is not tempting|pg||
nt|sybarra: now where to begin |pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: "a card"|pg||
nt|jaapfr: not too DD for fantoni:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: at first yes but the second bid would have corrected taht impression|pg||
nt|hedyg: he could still have 4+@s and long @ds|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: WOW 7@H reached|pg||
nt|hvdhaar: Pity that Rob Helle isn't watching; he's a Tarzan expert and encouraged Bauke en Simon to start using the system (some 5 years ago)|pg||
nt|hedyg: then it should be his duty to be here with us!|pg||
nt|hedyg: here 1@c is 2+|pg||
pc|c3|nt|kiwibridge: tell us about Tarzan please Hans|pg||
pc|c5|nt|sybarra: ugh,  as we can see probably low @D works better |pg||
nt|jcwla: Not free of pitfalls.  Meanwhile, 1 was a push when 3NT made in the OR, also with the help of a @S trick.|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes Peter sry|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|hedyg: claiming  all but the @hs|pg||
pc|hK|nt|hedyg: went all the way to dummy to play K@D?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: may as well go light now|pg||
nt|lestergold: With 4 spades and 5+ dims he would bid 4@s not risking the 5 level|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Missed it again, I'm very sorry.|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok np|pg||
nt|hedyg: Mike he could have a better hand with @s and @d and not want to just bid 4@s?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: pretty tough contract to play i would say|pg||
pc|h7|nt|hedyg: now J@H|pg||
nt|jaapfr: would love to hear his thinking analysis in these both tricks:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: if they play @s to ace and a @D back he can ruff and play K@C since S surely has A@c and no more @hs|pg||
nt|lestergold: possible but more important to use the 4n bid in the manner i described that standard bidding to show good dims|pg||
pc|h3|nt|marlowepi: i think S should have won the D to play hearts|pg||
nt|hedyg: what for?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe not |pg||
nt|hedyg: they are not going anywhere|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well i was thinking, to avoid this defence|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|hedyg: claim|pg||
nt|buffytvs: so EW need to find their spade ruff|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sT|nt|pelu: the winning line is (I hope :) to play @s to finess in trick 3 and then @d3 from hand|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but jack of diamonds would allow H to go away while N ruffs, so S was correct, my error|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E not thrilled with W play at trick one|pg||
nt|hedyg: low @H was encouraging by E|pg||
nt|ralfwil: claim...|pg||
pc|s6|nt|jaapfr: but same -4|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well claimed, ralf:)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|jaapfr: provided @HJ NOW:)|pg||
nt|mich-b: now he can play the @HJ safely|pg||
nt|jcwla: 2 was predictably 12 IMPs to Angelini as the OR N/S got to 4@C making 5 as against 5@CX making here.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mich-b: since it does not cost him a trump trick|pg||

mb|p|nt|marlowepi: easy 3N thx to heart blockage:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 1@c 14+ f1|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: was nice to watch|pg||
nt|hedyg: LOL better Shirley|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes and rightfully so |pg||
nt|hedyg: nice to be optimistic|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the mind boggles if this is the best|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sybarra: aida,  could paulissen have opened 1 club on the hand?  |pg||
nt|aida_mk_nl: no|pg||
nt|hedyg: they play Polish @c|pg||
mb|p|nt|aida_mk_nl: he can open 1@C if his hand in 16+ with 5@C|pg||
nt|pelu: in the syetem he was almost forced to open 1NT|pg||
nt|aida_mk_nl: then rebid 2@C|pg||
nt|aida_mk_nl: he could open 1@D |pg||
nt|sybarra: he had 16,  |pg||
nt|aida_mk_nl: then he downgraded his hand probably|pg||
nt|hedyg: Jansma feeling robbed|pg||
nt|sybarra: 1 @D in their system might have been better then  I am sure it will be discussed|pg||
nt|hedyg: on the other hand Nunes is in 3rd seat, he could have anything|pg||
nt|hedyg: EW can make 5 @ss|pg||
nt|hedyg: and 5@cs|pg||
nt|sybarra: someone has to get into the bidding for that |pg||
nt|pelu: still red against green - Nunes is a conservativ bidder (no junior-style)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: E based on last hand should have opened 1@C|pg||
nt|sybarra: dont think he can open 1 @C |pg||
nt|aida_mk_nl: I am sure paulissen made  the best bid in his view, it was just unlucky @H distribution|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree Aida |pg||
mb|1N|nt|hedyg: yes very interesting board|pg||
nt|jaapfr: this ending in 3@D or so|pg||
nt|hedyg: note that the Italian do NOT bid 1@H with 4 @hs and @ds|pg||
nt|hedyg: the 10@s is a huge card here|pg||
nt|mich-b: wasnt 1@D showing @H?|pg||
nt|hedyg: welcome Peter Lund :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: this should stop low|pg||
nt|hedyg: i do like xfer bids over 1NT here|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: put the strong hand on lead|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W is awfully string for a NF 2H|pg||
nt|marlowepi: strong|pg||
nt|hedyg: so much for 4@hs|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3H seems about right to me|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@d = unbalanced with @ds|pg||
nt|pelu: couldn't he bid 3@H (invitational?) - a strong hand would for sure start with X|pg||
nt|hedyg: rare to see a precision 2@c opening with a 5 card major|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: indeed|pg||
nt|hedyg: i dont think i have ever seen that before|pg||
nt|hvdhaar: de Wijs and Muller > WijsMuller > Weismuller > Tarzan :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol cute|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: nice Hans|pg||
nt|hedyg: just as well if they dont get to 4@H|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok you can beat 5 by leading @H as N and S underleads his AQJ@D|pg||
mb|2H|nt|hedyg: either 5+ @ds and a singleton somewhere or 4 4 4 1|pg||
nt|marlowepi: or with 2NT|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3nt on EW no problems with the block in @h|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: no|pg||
nt|hedyg: oh yes you are right Michael|pg||
nt|hedyg: Bob was 1@d alerted?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 2nt a solid contract to be in|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes xfrs cc here|pg||
nt|mich-b: I am a bit surprised they had no way to take out to 3@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: He tried to bid 2 clubs over 2 NT|pg||
nt|hedyg: seems Nunes saw a 1NT rebid|pg||
nt|mich-b: normally with South's hand one would expect 3@D to play better than 2NT|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty Bob|pg||
nt|jaapfr: agree|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Nunes that is.|pg||
nt|hedyg: right as he would have over 1NT|pg||
nt|jaapfr: although all T and 9 are pretty usefull in NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Fierce discussion ensued.|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Solved : ), he can do whatever he wants.|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i hope only with words:)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Zia in 5NX-1 on the 4SX hand so 14 to Netherlands|pg||
nt|hedyg: a friendly match |pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Nunes tried to bid 2 clubs over 2NT they solved it by all passing|pg||
nt|pelu: Hi all|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Peter :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello peter |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Jonsson must bid 4H here|pg||
nt|hedyg: lets you all do that specs :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 53 hearts more likely than 62|pg||
mb|4H|nt|hedyg: playing transfers he could bid 2@d and over 2@H 3 @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: now then|pg||
nt|marlowepi: echo in here:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jaapfr: no @SJ|pg||
nt|jaapfr: ty|pg||
nt|hedyg: TD: this is not fully according to the Laws but if you agree .... and all LOL|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Brink asks Fantoni if he could possibly play a bit faster|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: lol at that one|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Fantoni: your first words where, if it's possible!|pg||
nt|hedyg: LOL|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: were*|pg||
nt|hedyg: he thinks 3@H=4cards|pg||
nt|sybarra: watch the carding here,  all important |pg||
nt|hedyg: 5@d ended all hope for EW|pg||
nt|pelu: clever 5@D - if N pass I exp that Paulissen would have X|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d5|nt|kiwibridge: if that's Ice-Relay it just sank when the ice melted|pg||
pc|d6|nt|jcwla: E has nicely sitting cards, yes, but a real minimum hand.  Might summon up 3@H (thru some sequence) as W with that length and texture.|pg||
nt|hedyg: not that Muller would accept the invite|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes he could, but i don;t see why that should stop him from making the value bid of 3H when he isnt laying transfers|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1 spec tells me he remembers Belladonna opening a superprecision 2@c with 6 6 in 1973........|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|hedyg: nice spots in @H|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: even the great Bella had one lapse in his career ?|pg||
nt|hvdhaar: Bad hand for the NS-system; N didn't deny 4 H we must assume|pg||
pc|hA|nt|hedyg: 9@H a giveaway|pg||
nt|hedyg: however they lead high from odd nr of cards with an honour|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h3|nt|hedyg: or do they?|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|jaapfr: everything so friendly for declarer|pg||
nt|jaapfr: talking about ""faster"":)|pg||
nt|hedyg: OR catching up with us|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Nunes is already resting his head on the table|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 1H - ? - 4@C would do it|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok 4@H is down as well|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: but much preferable contract|pg||
nt|hedyg: indeed|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 3rd option would be an initial pass :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: just need Qx in @H on side|pg||
nt|hedyg: or AQx|pg||
nt|hedyg: here comes the @d back|pg||
pc|hK|pc|c6|nt|kiwibridge: he can't open @C with @C's but has to open 1N with xx in majors, is this a sound system?|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h5|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|sK|pc|s5|pg||
nt|hedyg: no overtake???|pg||
nt|aida_mk_nl: He could open Gary if HE THINK he should|pg||
nt|pelu: in CC: 1@D can be 4@D+5@c|pg||
pc|s4|nt|hedyg: surely Jansma did|pg||
nt|aida_mk_nl: :)|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: claim|pg||
nt|hedyg: it was actually Lukasz Slawinski|pg||
nt|marlowepi: specs there will be a partial refund of your tickets for having to watch a contract of 1S|pg||
nt|hedyg: i am not refunding!|pg||
nt|hedyg: pass by S partially based on weak 1 level overcalls|pg||
pc|hK|nt|pelu: 5@C is on - can setup a@D to discard the @s-loser|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|h4|pg||
nt|jaapfr: these 20-20 1nt are thrilling imo|pg||

nt|hedyg: that is a semi-balanced NT|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: and a lead away from KJ to many with AKQx of trumps :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: unblock A@H just in case?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|hedyg: 9@d unblocking just in case|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: wasted 9@D :(|pg||

nt|hedyg: 9 and 7@d were equivalent|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: ok sure|pg||

nt|hedyg: since 8@d is in dummy|pg||
nt|jaapfr: ok votes on: -1 or made   i vote for made|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: no OR hibernating too|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: now|pg||
nt|jaapfr: to think here aagain so long must be teasing dummy:)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|hedyg: might play @hs off the top here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: angling for trump|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|hedyg: not really, they just switch off when partner is playing|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Keyboard failed(again), missed it, apologies.|pg||
nt|hedyg: in 3@H X the defense slipped up by not playing J@D so -4 for a push|pg||
nt|jaapfr: it is still much better than my Spanish wifi Bob|pg||
nt|hedyg: so he didnt play the K@D?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: I feel sorry for you.|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Ace|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok np|pg||
nt|hedyg: ace or king all the same|pg||

nt|hedyg: bd 5 2NT in OR|pg||
nt|hedyg: leading his long suit when long in trumps, hoping to tap declarer|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a @h switch is good for the defence|pg||
pc|d5|nt|jaapfr: only 24 C and all blue sky:(|pg||
nt|buffytvs: so this will be 5 more IMPs to Korbel, reducing the deficit to 10|pg||

pc|s8|nt|hvdhaar: now west can't overruff the 3rd H !|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 16 highs plus a void and shows 11-15 what is the point of playing prec?|pg||

pc|c6|nt|hedyg: but a @s back and another @D here.......|pg||

nt|hedyg: not sure he would lead a top @d after the 2@d bid|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cQ|pc|c8|nt|marlowepi: dont think that is clear. E holds club ace so with AK of diamonds he would not need to lead one--no diamond loser could run away|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: not just making but missing game :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: now 6@H C pls|pg||
nt|hedyg: i dont see how he could make 9 tricks|pg||
nt|jaapfr: and claim in trick 3 pls|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Fantoni is on the toilet...|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: LOL|pg||
nt|jaapfr: true 6@S-3 -800 good save here|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: I'll correct it in a second.|pg||
nt|hedyg: maybe doubling 3NT was a mistake...|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: excitement anyway, match is warming up|pg||
nt|hedyg: always fun to watch these guys :)|pg||
nt|buffytvs: but if South's hearts are a little worse, Mike is quite right to take the save over 4@H|pg||
nt|buffytvs: Here the Zaluskis just got too high in the OR|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mich-b: sry all , must leave now|pg||
mb|p|nt|mich-b: enjoy the rest|pg||
nt|jcwla: Sorry I think the @CA lead without K or Q tells the story.|pg||
nt|hedyg: could be :)|pg||
nt|hvdhaar: Could have been costly for NS after 1 Cl - 2 Cl overcall ...|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: should you be allowed to psyche a limited opening holding 16 and playing Prec?|pg||
nt|hedyg: curious how the bidding will go in OR|pg||
nt|hedyg: 6@c|pg||
mb|3S|nt|hedyg: ty Michael :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: cheers M|pg||
nt|jaapfr: bye mich|pg||
nt|ralfwil: is this enough for 6@c on NS? looks likes that|pg||
nt|hedyg: can you beat it?|pg||
nt|buffytvs: Ross Taylor, however, did not open 2@S, so we'll see what difference that makes|pg||
mb|4C|nt|kiwibridge: heavy 1@S|pg||
nt|pelu: Ok - Bob - hard job :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I don't think so|pg||
nt|hedyg: why not?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: if not 4@S (logic) by S free 6@H now i think|pg||
nt|hedyg: why would S bid 4@s?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: meaning slam very likely now|pg||
nt|pelu: remember i "imposible 3NT in board 3: IN OE played from East (and N "open" 1@S??) so @S-lead to A and @S back. Unblock @Hs and easy 9 tricks|pg||
nt|hedyg: bd 3 Drijver made an unfortunate 1@s opening in 3rd seat (his turn to bid) and Zia made 3NT +1 on a small @s lead|pg||
nt|hedyg: ooooops sry Peter|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@s 10-13 unbalanced |pg||
nt|pelu: this time Hedy I was 0.1 sec before u :):)|pg||
nt|hedyg: you were indeed!|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: X would be good here EW|pg||
nt|hedyg: they will do well to stay out of @hs|pg||
nt|buffytvs: How much allowance will Darrne make for the fact that his partner was under pressure?|pg||
nt|buffytvs: Darren|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|jaapfr: agree 100%|pg||
nt|pelu: "maybe" :)?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: ethics |pg||
nt|hvdhaar: Bauke decided that he was much better placed to show 3-suiter after 1 D opener|pg||
nt|hedyg: he only downgraded by 1hcp|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Plenty of jokes about not making any contract|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: no:)|pg||
mb|5C|nt|hedyg: A@D?|pg||
nt|hvdhaar: They play 1 Cl - 1 D (neg) - 1 H as a relay (19+) and 2 D rebid would deny a major  |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: sacre bleu you either play a system or you dont :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: @hs are very friendly|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N wont be thrilled at 6C until dummy hits. he could have more for his 1N|pg||
nt|hedyg: like a LOT more?|pg||
nt|hedyg: but remember that 1@H is f1|pg||
nt|hedyg: so actually he promised 0 hcps|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sure but he still has borscht|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: i am not keen on the 2D then 3D sequence|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and i am not sure that double is a better can than 4D|pg||
nt|marlowepi: call|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 4@s is not kickback here?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: meant NOT 4@S bid by S    is logic|pg||
nt|pelu: I like to be in 6@hs|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@d was 10-15, 2+ @ds , 11-13 if balanced|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: ok, cancel that specs say 6 either minor|pg||
nt|pelu: even 6@c making, but need to find @Dq on the short @d-hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: Aida what is 4NT? rkc?|pg||
nt|czyzyk: Darren is quite good at giving his partner some rope.|pg||
nt|buffytvs: you would know :)|pg||
nt|czyzyk: :)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|kiwibridge: another one slips away|pg||
pc|s4|nt|pelu: ??|pg||
nt|jcwla: Did you TiVo this, Hedy? :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: LOL|pg||
nt|sybarra: lol|pg||
nt|hedyg: it is just the correct play|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in any case, the heart finesse was unlikely to gain anything even if working, as the 4th round of heart was a loser anyway. unless you have in mind declarer unblocking club king at ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: trick one|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|hedyg: but your @cs are better |pg||
nt|hedyg: oy|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol Gary|pg||
nt|hedyg: you also play your intuition!|pg||
nt|hedyg: well ok..they do cause they are all world class players!|pg||
nt|hedyg: better for me if i dont :(|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sybarra: eek  is this best?|pg||
nt|pelu: I exp that it was @D to Q and K, and now @CQ from W|pg||
nt|pelu: 4Nt I exp = @D-suit and some support for @C|pg||
nt|czyzyk: Good bidding by EW and we have a new leader|pg||
pc|c6|nt|hedyg: why did Jansma not bid 4@d?|pg||
nt|pelu: 2 x 3-2 fit - if @hs 4-1 u cant make any slam - if @Hs 3-2 and @cs 4-1 still slam in @h|pg||
nt|pelu: why 4@s and not 4NT?|pg||
nt|hedyg: Paulissen has bid his heart out|pg||
nt|sybarra: dragging the "good hand"  (W)|pg||
nt|aida_mk_nl: i dont think so, i dont know actually|pg||
pc|cK|nt|marlowepi: you would want to play 7C facing as little as K of spades and Qxxxx of clubs|pg||
nt|hedyg: only way to 6@c is bashing it|pg||
nt|buffytvs: so this is the last board of this set|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good morning to Geoffrey Wolfarth|pg||
nt|hedyg: but Peter is right, on 4NT he would get 3 keycards and then can bid slam|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: if you had to worry about pard haveing a negative resp you would never play a strong club :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: with Qx@D are they good or lucky|pg||
pc|c5|nt|roswolf: hi all|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but prefer nt and not 4@S bid by W|pg||
nt|hedyg: hi Geoffrey :)|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cT|pc|cA|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3 kaycards MUST be 2 aces and K@H here|pg||
nt|hedyg: i dont think he was worried about that, rather about describing his hand economically|pg||
nt|buffytvs: thx to my fellow commentator Jurek and our hard-working operator|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kiwibridge: 75% of the time or more my pard responds 1@D|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sK|nt|ralfwil: and very clear (6@c) after 3@h in my opinion|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|hedyg: so then ask for Q@H and went W denies stop in 6|pg||
nt|hedyg: keycards*|pg||
nt|hedyg: i dont understand "better than 4@H" and then refuse to cue @D|pg||
nt|hedyg: ah ok ty Bob|pg||
nt|lc: 4@D would not have shown a control -- would have just been better than 4@H|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|pelu: with @C-s 4-1 decl cant make a safe-play in @h - @hK (J or Q from S) and ran @h8|pg||
nt|buffytvs: next set is at 12.45 -- just time for a quick sandwich before that gets under way|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: close match here|pg||
pc|s7|nt|niclecuyer: hi all|pg||
pc|d5|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|hedyg: hi Larry, welcome :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes now we know |pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure he has a choice for making except the k of @D, @D, does he?|pg||
nt|pelu: remember that 2@S is contructiv opening - 10-13 - so S is favorit to have @DQ|pg||
nt|aida_mk_nl: i agree peter and @H lead means only one thing -> singleton|pg||
nt|buffytvs: yes, I expect this one to be hard-fought all the way|pg||
nt|czyzyk: Hi Nic.|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|kiwibridge: indeed S is 10-13|pg||
pc|h5|nt|sybarra: welcome Larry, |pg||
nt|hedyg: hmmm bd 4 4@H in OR|pg||
nt|sybarra: @D's 4/1 will be a problem |pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|lc: Oh thanks -- didn't mean to intrude.|pg||
nt|sybarra: you are always welcome!!|pg||
pc|h6|nt|sybarra: but good fortune |pg||
pc|h3|nt|hedyg: np at all, always a pleasure to read your comments|pg||
nt|buffytvs: come back at 12.45 Nick|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h8|pg||
nt|pelu: so 4@s was = 4NT (RKC)|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: yes I was commenting the women finals|pg||
pc|hK|nt|hedyg: yes|pg||
nt|hedyg: watching the @H spots carefully|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: and we were wondering how everyone was doing on that board 7|pg||
pc|h9|pc|d4|pc|h4|pg||
pc|s8|nt|buffytvs: what happened in that match?|pg||
pc|sT|nt|hedyg: now @s disc|pg||
nt|czyzyk: EW have some good boards not being scored yet so the match will not be that close at the end of the quarter, I believe.|pg||
pc|c8|pc|s5|pg||
nt|buffytvs: yes at least 2 game swings it looked like|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d2|pc|dA|nt|niclecuyer: Cimon has a bid lead|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dJ|nt|buffytvs: surprise :)|pg||
mc|11|nt|buffytvs: ok, cu all in 45 min|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: but you have to be careful with the scores has they had a problem with the captain names|pg||

pc|dJ|nt|ritong: was it a problem of blackwood?|pg||
nt|ritong: east knew there were two keys off|pg||

pc|d3|pc|d4|nt|andreasw:  only way is to lay low?|pg||

nt|hedyg: i doubt that was actual play..|pg||
nt|pelu: correct, Bob?|pg||
nt|hedyg: we will never know :(|pg||
nt|hvdhaar: On board 4 (the grand Brink DBLed 3S > 3 N from N, 4 H pass pass pass !|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 17 imps on the grand thats a BIG loss|pg||
nt|hedyg: Brink did as we suggested, he bid X over 3@s and 4@H over 3NT...|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: claimed on the finesses Bob?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Uhuh|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: He played the diamonds..|pg||
nt|hedyg: Fantoni could have had 4@cs and 5@ds in the same hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: this could be sporting|pg||
nt|lc: As shown, he would have gone down (if he ducked a heart).|pg||
nt|pelu: ok he maded 6 - but not as the operator played - tell us Bob - how did he make?|pg||
nt|hedyg: or score, yes|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Quite sure I got it right|pg||
nt|hedyg: sry Hans, you are to quick for me|pg||
mb|1C|nt|ralfwil: As S I had expected @hQx from P when he bid 3@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: east should bid spades naturally for me|pg||
nt|hedyg: no way to make 6 that way|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Want me to ask them afterwards?|pg||
nt|pelu: didn't he loose a @h and a @c?|pg||
nt|jcwla: On Board 5 in OR, 1@D by E and by W........ 4@H.|pg||
nt|hedyg: how did he guess the Qx in @d?|pg||
nt|hedyg: i think he would have bid that immediately|pg||
mb|1S|nt|hedyg: S passed?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3D is a good bid facing a passed hand|pg||
nt|hvdhaar: DBL - 3 S ?|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@s=11-15|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i agree Ralf. in fact the main advantage of double is that you get to learn more about N shape. if 1N denied four spades (i am not sure it did), then the fact that pd did not pass ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the double  of 3D suggests pd's clubs are legitimate|pg||
nt|buffytvs: and welcome|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: maybe that double = @s|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|jaapfr: y|pg||
nt|hedyg: if they play transfer bids|pg||
nt|hedyg: he did indeed|pg||
nt|hedyg: knowing that N had 3 cards..|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: he "gambled", there was some.. relief.|pg||
nt|buffytvs: hi all|pg||
mb|2S|nt|hedyg: maybe a squeeze on S?|pg||
nt|lc: Once he ducked a heart (if he did) and played the clubs from the top (normal) he had to be -1.|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Nevermind they did go downn|pg||
nt|hedyg: ohhhhhhh ok|pg||
nt|sybarra: will get the straightened out |pg||
nt|sybarra: and jams the auction for for n/s |pg||
nt|hedyg: well wow|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: but does it show 5?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Lunch break after this match. Restart at 13.00 local time, in 1 hour and 35 minutes|pg||
nt|hvdhaar: This will TRF them int 4 H :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: as I would have bid 1N rather than X....|pg||
mb|3N|nt|kiwibridge: guess Bob missed a pass somewhere|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3C over the fiurst double didnt have to mean much at all|pg||
mb|p|nt|lc: A system triumph here, since 1@H is a beautiful contract. (As opposed to 2NT P P P )|pg||
nt|pelu: 1@h = 14+, X = neg|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: 4@S?|pg||
nt|roswolf: methinks n/s have had a foft ride in the bidding|pg||
nt|roswolf: soft|pg||
nt|hedyg: strange pass by E imo|pg||
nt|lc: Too early in the morning here -- I think West too light for 2NT  :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3N a somewhat hungry call here|pg||
mb|p|nt|czyzyk: hello Ray|pg||
nt|buffytvs: hi Jurek|pg||
nt|buffytvs: for those who don';t know the players...|pg||
pc|dA|nt|hedyg: 1@d was relay|pg||
nt|hedyg: i am told Drijver apologized after a short discussion|pg||
nt|hedyg: Bob undo pls|pg||
nt|marlowepi: with a bad suit and no aces, transfer to see if pd likes it. if she doesnt, 3C will be enough|pg||
nt|buffytvs: Cafferata and Colbert are former winners of this event|pg||
pc|d5|nt|roswolf: agree - no barrage made it easier for n/s|pg||
nt|jaapfr: nasty sys here in this situation|pg||
nt|jaapfr: for ew|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: But you never know, I can ask him afterwards.|pg||
nt|buffytvs: Dan Korbel won the GNT second flight a couple of years back|pg||
pc|d2|nt|hedyg: overtake just in case|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|hedyg: but this contract will not make|pg||
nt|jaapfr: with natural bidding it would be automatic 4@S by EW down 1|pg||
nt|hedyg: so 4@H a good sac vs 3@s =|pg||
nt|jaapfr: :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: also against 2@S|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@s= 11-14 4 @ss|pg||
nt|Walddk4: How did declarer make 9 tricks in 1NT on board 6?|pg||
nt|hedyg: but surely 3@s would not show strength by E|pg||
nt|jaapfr: operator did:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: He didn't|pg||
nt|hedyg: we dont know :(|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Bob was going to correct it Roland|pg||
nt|Walddk4: How many did he actually make?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 7|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1NN=  is the code|pg||
nt|jaapfr: still a chance 4@H will be made here|pg||
nt|hedyg: unlucky all minor honours off side|pg||
nt|hedyg: ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Sorry, laptop decided to have his own will.|pg||
nt|hedyg: pls correct that result|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: After they finish playing|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok|pg||
nt|hedyg: laptops are tricky things|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: can't make 4@H can he?|pg||
nt|hedyg: he should not|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: all suits wrong|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: had he bid 1N he wouldn't have this problem|pg||
nt|hedyg: the maximum he can make is 9 tricks as far as i can see|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: King holds, followed by another spade, 8H QH, 2H AH, KH, 2C T Q|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: If that's understandable|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes it is!|pg||
nt|hedyg: and E switches to @D|pg||
nt|hedyg: can disc 1@d on a @c but should lose 2@cs, 2@ds and a @s|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Muller is thinking...|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Yup 5D|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: double swing for 11 on the 3N hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: for the jack, followed by 5C for the ace, and another D|pg||
nt|hedyg: so this should be -2 |pg||
nt|hedyg: yes Gary, 5@D EW in OR?|pg||
nt|hedyg: doubled -2|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: -1 here|pg||

nt|pelu: I can see down 2 - but never down 3 - try to help us BOB|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: -2|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok ty|pg||
nt|hedyg: the @d disc makes no sense|pg||
nt|marlowepi: easy to get careless when unhappy with the contract|pg||
mb|1D|nt|hedyg: lol yes!|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: now 6@S ns|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but for Fantoni routine to find best line:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: it is wonderful that the Dutch have these generous sponsors!|pg||
nt|hedyg: (White House)|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@d= (9)10-13 unbalanced|pg||
mb|1S|nt|kiwibridge: 7 even|pg||
nt|roswolf: and now a simple slam hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: why only 6?|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@D = 10-13|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@c 2+|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: 7@S|pg||
nt|sybarra: one of the few countries that have such sponsors|pg||
nt|lc: E-W have a slam -- but have gone conservative.|pg||
nt|pelu: 0.1 sec again Hedy :)|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I would expect both pairs to play sound bridge -- no flights of fancy|pg||
nt|czyzyk: Dan and Darren are also last year CNTC winners.|pg||
mb|1N|nt|Walddk4: 4HW-2  is the code|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Bob trys our patience for the umpteenth time :(|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 110 coming|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@c would be gf|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@c is invite|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: 2@c FG|pg||
nt|jaapfr: and they will bid that|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@c = gf with @c or balanced or fit @s|pg||
nt|hedyg: only -1 Bob? not -2?|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@s, 2@ds and 2@cs|pg||
nt|buffytvs: 2@C is probably artifical now|pg||
nt|buffytvs: so Colbert will have to decide whether to play spades or notrump|pg||
mb|2S|nt|jcwla: A light 2@H here.|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: N obviously also feared doubleton heart in S hand as he did not play a heart right away when in with spade|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@h was down|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: can now disc a @s on @H|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Typo, changed it.|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok ty|pg||
nt|hedyg: he is trying hard, it's a very tough job!|pg||
nt|marlowepi: ok 100 coming|pg||
nt|hedyg: would you find the @H lead?|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: and a claim at trick 1|pg||
nt|lc: It's easy for us to say that West should have balanced, but we see all 52 cards.|pg||
nt|sybarra: being red,  not easy to jump into this bidding maybe|pg||
nt|lc: South could have had some of those hearts that East has.|pg||
nt|hedyg: not a great @H suit he has|pg||
nt|lc: There is an expression to cover West's decision: "It is dangerous to bid, it is dangerous to pass."  This time it was the latter.|pg||
nt|hedyg: nobody can accuse Jansma of lack of courage :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: W is in trouble|pg||
nt|hedyg: how about pass?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: dont need to|pg||
nt|hedyg: small from even withough honour or odd with|pg||
pc|dA|nt|marlowepi: but lowest spade seems very dangerous|pg||
nt|hedyg: it is systemic|pg||
pc|d3|nt|hedyg: 3NT serious asking for cuebids|pg||
nt|hedyg: and make on a @c guess, but needs a very good guess|pg||
pc|dT|nt|pelu: as I see - no lead can defeat 5@D by force|pg||
nt|jcwla: A reasonable question to ask is "How will this do if pd has seven points?"|pg||
nt|hedyg: tricky @C, would play same from A@c|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@H asked for @c?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Q of clubs and spade back may be best chance, as N would misguess. but that opening lead would be.........difficult to find:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he shd play low despite opening bid|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i mean overcall|pg||
nt|hedyg: hard to believe Muller is handing him the @c suit on a platter|pg||
nt|hedyg: double was t/o for the black suits|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok Muller could be a bit stronger..|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: indeed|pg||
nt|hedyg: but they play rev smith|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|jaapfr: IF knowing 2 clubs and AK K THen we all bid 7@S:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4NT= even number of keycards|pg||
nt|lc: It's not much fun to be -110 or -130 when you have 1430 available (although, N-S have a good sacrifice against slam).|pg||
nt|hedyg: i was betting on a @s lead|pg||
pc|hA|nt|marlowepi: harder to believe he is quickly playing a club from the ace. also he needs much more to be the case to play for club ace on|pg||
nt|pelu: wd|pg||
pc|h2|nt|hedyg: if he can assume that W has 5 @hs then the small @H was preferential|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but communications?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: odd way to play the clubs|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|hedyg: so 9@C= i dont want @s|pg||
pc|c8|nt|hedyg: 5@c= Q@S?|pg||
pc|c7|nt|hedyg: takes guts to bid 3@s|pg||
nt|aida_mk_nl: :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: they always play that as short?|pg||
nt|hedyg: could not be fit?|pg||
nt|sybarra: but the suit was set |pg||
nt|sybarra: in hearts|pg||
nt|aida_mk_nl: yes suit is set and that is @H|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok ty|pg||
nt|marlowepi: would block suit if someone has A9xx|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|hedyg: 5@D = yes and K@D?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: the crux of this board is the xx of S in @C during bidding|pg||
nt|hedyg: oh 5@c cue and 5@d cue|pg||
nt|hedyg: the lead gave him his 7th trick|pg||
nt|hedyg: he had no trick in @H if he had to play the suit himself|pg||
nt|hedyg: so never show @s fit|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s7|nt|jaapfr: and not a 3 card or 4|pg||
nt|hedyg: he got his ruff going now|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if club king holds there is still a lot of work to do|pg||
pc|s4|nt|hvdhaar: Interesting point: Muller could DBL 1 H with the blacks, what's the difference. De Wijs assumed Muller had H too for this sequence|pg||
nt|hvdhaar: which was (a bit) true indeed|pg||
nt|hedyg: but here he is just balancing|pg||
nt|hedyg: where as if he doubled earlier he might have a better hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: like maximum pass|pg||
nt|marlowepi: how fortunate that dummy had diamond ace so that the club-spot plays didnt have to show count|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|hedyg: 5NT asks for Q@s for 7|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: very nice play will be shorter than bidding?|pg||
nt|hedyg: instant claim|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: even with Fantoni declarer|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes even |pg||
nt|hedyg: what is RNC?|pg||
nt|hedyg: both N and S reverse smithed|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I like @dJ better than @dQ|pg||
pc|h3|nt|sybarra: guys unfortunately I have to leave,  business issues over whelming me today (not my orginal plan) |pg||
nt|marlowepi: smith shouldnt take prcedence over count when count is a crucial issue, which it often is|pg||
pc|hK|nt|hedyg: ty Shirley :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx all ad cu later |pg||
pc|h6|nt|hedyg: Bob?|pg||
nt|hedyg: this is wrong|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Yea, sorry...|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Quite sure it isn't|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Nope should be right.|pg||
nt|hedyg: either declarer played J@D or Nunes made the 10|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: And so Nunes made the 10....|pg||
nt|hedyg: and?|pg||
nt|hedyg: did he play @H?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: And nothing we are waiting|pg||
pc|h8|pg||

nt|vugraphzgq: Fantoni -> Brink: Faster now?|pg||

nt|hedyg: lol ok|pg||
mb|1D|nt|lc: Almost a textbook weak-2 here. (or Multi)|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok np|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: multi it is|pg||
nt|lc: The big weakness of Multi is that with a weak-2 in @S it often allows opponents in with a @H overcall -- but here, South just didn't have enough.|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes pls correct|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: it says 1NT =, it's correct|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes|pg||
mb|1H|nt|hedyg: yes Bob|pg||
nt|roswolf: well more mixed hand here|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: meanwhile 19 to Welland on 1NX and 6@D making|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: I'm not sure opening the East hadn is going to work out that well this time -- have a feeling they're going to get too high|pg||
mb|1S|nt|hedyg: why pass by Brink?|pg||
nt|pelu: why not 2@S from W?|pg||
nt|lc: If 2@S was pass/correct, that would seem to be a better choice.  |pg||
nt|hedyg: would we all have bid 2@H as W, i would have bid 2@s (positive in @H)|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@S = P/C|pg||
nt|hedyg: oh well, we all agree|pg||
nt|lc: So, strange to bid 2@H|pg||
nt|lc: Gives an extra "round" of bidding making it easier for opps to judge.|pg||
nt|pelu: if we all agree - not good :):)|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@HX= takeout of @H|pg||
nt|lc: So important to thoroughly know your agreement against these Multi auctions.|pg||
nt|aida_mk_nl: not really probably typo, they play optional rkc|pg||
nt|hedyg: there was no play, quick claim|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: They claimed without play previous game.|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: super max for 2@C (11-15 and 6 card suit)|pg||
nt|hedyg: if they go on like this we will have a 3rd miracle today and Muller / Fantoni will finish before the other table again!|pg||
nt|jcwla: If they bid this slam against you, get back into bed, pull the covers up around you, and don't come out for 24 hours.|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@d looks right|pg||
mb|1N|nt|hedyg: 3@d???|pg||
nt|hedyg: is this a transfer?|pg||
nt|lc: Perhaps they treat the X as a strong notrump, and over interference they play x-fer lebensohl --  that, or a typo.|pg||
nt|hedyg: strange IF the double shows short @hs|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: No typos|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|lc: This surely tests the partnership agreements.  Even a long-time experienced partnership such as N-S can have trouble with such auctions.|pg||
nt|hedyg: bd 7 EW are in 5@c XX|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty specs :)|pg||
nt|lc: Sounds like we'll lose everyone watching.  Who wouldn't want to watch 5@C XX!|pg||
nt|hedyg: LOL|pg||
nt|hedyg: we all know 5@c XX makes so not really exciting|pg||
nt|pelu: just 11 tricks from the top - and some play for 12 :(|pg||
nt|lc: So, how does 5@CXX compare to the 1430 that was available in 6@H?|pg||
nt|lc: Maybe it is more fun to see if Baldursson-Jonsson will play in a 4-1 fit. :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: much more fun|pg||
nt|jcwla: 6 a push at 3@S making.|pg||
nt|pelu: 1@C several poss - here balanced 15+|pg||
nt|sybarra: 12 off the top |pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: this will be a struggle|pg||
nt|hedyg: they open 1@c with 12.14 balanced|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@d stopped Fantoni bidding 3@s|pg||
nt|pelu: super optimist - going for slam opp a passed pd|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@d bid not a surprise for Muller|pg||
nt|pelu: but he is correct|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 180 is there hedy|pg||
nt|hedyg: not anymore :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: with no @D lead |pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@d t/o for @H+@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 4@S= we have take-off|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i dont think you have to be a superoptimist with those clubs and those hearts|pg||
nt|hedyg: ah yes sry|pg||
nt|hedyg: forgot the X|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: a small @s lead is needed here|pg||
nt|hedyg: and then lean back and wait|pg||
nt|lc: 4th from your longest and strongest.|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@d X*|pg||
nt|buffytvs: guess not -- a conservatvie 1NT from West keeps them low|pg||
pc|cT|nt|jaapfr: sstruggle for who?|pg||
nt|hedyg: 5!X XX = 1000 and 15 imps|pg||
nt|lc: They can run to 4@C -- and not get X, I'd think.|pg||
nt|lc: What if North runs to 4@D, though, thinking 3@D was natural!|pg||
nt|hedyg: hmmm|pg||
nt|hedyg: Jansma trying to scare them into 4@h|pg||
nt|pelu: last time EW X - they was close to push opp in 5@c (4@c +1) - no danger here for EW|pg||
nt|hedyg: 12-14 NT|pg||
nt|buffytvs: with the favorable club position, declarer can build a fourth club trick, but he won't know that after this lead|pg||
pc|c2|nt|hvdhaar: Board 6 got costly for NS indeed|pg||
nt|hedyg: did anybody bring coffee?|pg||
nt|sybarra: ??|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lc: Are they using screens? (I doubt it for this kind of match) --  it would be nice to know the table action on who is alering what to whom.|pg||
nt|buffytvs: although he might figure it out later in the play|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|hedyg: Bob usually shows the alerts|pg||
nt|hedyg: not this time though|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Yes, screens, I'll add the alerts.|pg||
nt|lc: Well, if ever there was an alert, 3@D had to be one.  :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@d did too|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Iceland is a strong bridge nation. The proudest moment in Icelandic bridge was obviously in 1991 when the team won the World Championships (Bermuda Bowl) in Yokohama, Japan, by ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: defeating Poland in the final|pg||
nt|hedyg: with @d lead as well if you are talking re play last hand Shirley|pg||
pc|s7|nt|roswolf: a hopeless struggle for declarer|pg||
pc|sK|nt|hedyg: nice Q@d|pg||
pc|s4|nt|sybarra: and even @D lead ok as the losing @D goes on spade   (thx Jeanine, I didnt look carefully) |pg||
nt|hedyg: this will be painful|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Baldursson and Jónsson were in that team, but not as partners|pg||
nt|hedyg: this wont be pretty to watch|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E did bid 2H freely too. even spade king and Axxxxx of hearts gives you good play|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok to let E ruff a loser|pg||
pc|hK|nt|kiwibridge: nice 8@H|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|hedyg: notice bd 6 in OR same 1@d opening|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h6|pg||
nt|jcwla: 7 a push at 1NT making 2.|pg||
nt|hedyg: Fantoni passed over 4@d so he wants another lead|pg||
nt|pelu: for sure De wijs didn't exp singelton @s by pd - thjey have 10 card an never bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: that lead saved a trick|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 5@H?|pg||
nt|pelu: Welland in 3NT on the 6-3 fit in @h - making after a @c lead - @s-lead would defeat|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: ....|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Missed it, 3 tricks within 5 seconds.|pg||
nt|hedyg: what is happening Bob?|pg||
nt|hedyg: :(|pg||
nt|hedyg: you could ask them nicely to slow down?|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|hedyg: Jansma showed either 2 cards in @S or singleton|pg||
nt|lc: We can see that East can throw minors on the @H's -- but -- it won't be clear to him.|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: I was born in 1991,|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: have a glass of my excellent Chardonnay :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: No, they are thinking very long on a lot of the problems, resulting in play everything very fast to catch up.|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c5|nt|hedyg: lol ty|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|hedyg: disced an ace|pg||
nt|lc: He is probably thinking : "If @S run, down anyway, so let me make sure not to throw away a minor."|pg||
nt|lc: For example, a @D discard would be disastrous if declarer had @DAKQxx.|pg||
nt|lc: I suppose a @C discard is unlikely to hurt in most layouts.|pg||
nt|pelu: can W signal in "hs that he like the @S-lead?|pg||
nt|lc: Smith echo -- hi-lo in @H would say "Like @S"|pg||
nt|lc: I suppose having a 2nd space could mean liking them.|pg||
nt|hedyg: no Smith on their CC|pg||
nt|pelu: LH = even - no "smith"|pg||
nt|lc: Anyway, Baldursson was surely pleased to see a @S discard.  :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: and Lavinthal|pg||
nt|pelu: so S sh take another @H and hope that East will disc a @s|pg||
nt|lc: sounds good to me.|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: I lost it.|pg||
nt|pelu: sorry N - but same hope :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe not|pg||
nt|pelu: how do u play - @cs can easy be 4-1?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|roswolf: defence take their fill of tricks|pg||
nt|jaapfr: @S8 ends the story|pg||
nt|hedyg: ohhhhh again :(|pg||
nt|hedyg: so he must have disced another @S|pg||
nt|lc: One @S discard meant 500.  Another would have been 200.|pg||
nt|hedyg: a bit early here for that|pg||
nt|marlowepi: how could they miss the obvious 4S? :):)|pg||

nt|Walddk4: 15.45 is CET, in 3 hours and 50 minutes|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes -1 now|pg||
nt|hvdhaar: East has at the most INV strenght or else he would have started with 1 N (GF relay)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lc: In 3NT there appear to be only 8 tricks.|pg||
nt|buffytvs: very hard hand to judge, especially with EW bidding|pg||
pc|h2|nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|lc: Normal play picks up the @C, of course.|pg||
nt|hedyg: he can pick up the J@c|pg||
nt|marlowepi: wow|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@c pushed them|pg||
nt|hedyg: after a long think he might play small @c...|pg||
nt|hedyg: careful keeping the J@C as entry|pg||
nt|hedyg: and when that works he is home|pg||
nt|marlowepi: good moment for a 1H overcall|pg||
nt|hedyg: too late!|pg||
nt|czyzyk: It was probably Lebensohl, otherwise N should raise. |pg||
pc|h5|nt|lc: Could get interesting in that both E and W have to keep @H guards and can be thrown in.|pg||
nt|hedyg: bd 10 3NT in OR, no double|pg||
nt|lc: I;'m guessing the only legit way to beat it was to cash 4@D and then exit (but even then, East might be caught in a major-suit sqz).|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|hedyg: now a @H back|pg||

nt|marlowepi: 130 available|pg||
nt|marlowepi: or 110 EW|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: no wonder the others dropped it|pg||
nt|hvdhaar: Unusual but true :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Everything so far alerted|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes it says it may contain 5@ss in 1st or 2nd|pg||
nt|rhelle: Board 6: The 1@d opening is systematically ok; 1@c is an alternative, of course|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Hi all, just giving Bob a break|pg||
nt|hedyg: automatic @H lead|pg||
nt|marlowepi: weak 2-suited openers are extremely popular in northern europe, but in my view they are theoretically unsound. |pg||
nt|hedyg: she is nv and has what she promised|pg||
nt|hedyg: actually maybe even more|pg||
mb|2C|nt|pelu: in 5@D decl set up @SJ to dicard a !X - and then @C to J|pg||
nt|jcwla: OK let's hear it for the non-forcing 1NT, Marshall. :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: lol|pg||

mb|p|nt|sybarra: N and E checking backs of cards,  |pg||
nt|hedyg: LOL|pg||
nt|sybarra: or maybe they have all the points?|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|rhelle: Yes, systematically they open 1@h with 55 majors|pg||
nt|rhelle: to keep the relays etc symmetric|pg||
nt|hedyg: Muller putting all his passcards on the tray?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: wd Marc he needs it :)|pg||

mb|2H|mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: oops|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2NT= minors maybe|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@s (9)10-13 unbalanced|pg||
nt|buffytvs: but he was lokking at @DAK and partner had just pushed to the 4-level|pg||
nt|buffytvs: he either has a lot of shape or some high cards somewhere|pg||
nt|buffytvs: but of course it's easy looking at all the hands L)|pg||
nt|buffytvs: :)|pg||
mb|3H|nt|hedyg: but now he could be 5 4?|pg||
nt|rhelle: no - he's certain to compete to 2@s now|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: this looks too bold|pg||
nt|hedyg: probably :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: A@S on side|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: most experienced Dutch operators having other things this weekend|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: this detracking by X of N i think|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the issue is not whether her hand fits the description. the issue is whether that is a good method|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle: snap!|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Jonsson should have passed out 1@H|pg||
nt|hedyg: is 5 cards @s a certainty here?|pg||
nt|czyzyk: He was looking for excuses, obviously. :)|pg||
pc|d8|nt|hedyg: no way!|pg||
nt|buffytvs: looks like a miscommunication here too|pg||
pc|d2|nt|roswolf: this wont make|pg||
nt|jaapfr: sorry i am wrong|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 5@D logic contract although down here|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3NT was down as well|pg||
nt|hedyg: as was 3@s X|pg||
nt|hedyg: but that was not a penalty double|pg||
nt|hedyg: denied 4@hs, showed minors imo|pg||
nt|hedyg: Nunes bid his 5th @H|pg||
nt|rhelle: yes|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty|pg||
nt|hedyg: K@d by S and @H?|pg||
pc|d5|nt|sybarra: certainly  looks like it from here|pg||
nt|hedyg: reallyyyyyyyyy nice to have you here Rob :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 2NT ! is that a dreadful bid?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: but as the Bermuda Bowl will be in the Netherlands we need more operators then, for them practicing too|pg||
nt|hedyg: he didnt duck that?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: I was wrong|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok :(|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I like the 3@H bid -- but not sure why South passed it.|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
pc|h2|nt|hedyg: now a @s?|pg||
nt|pelu: I dont belive that decl discard @D2|pg||
nt|marlowepi: surprised by 4th club|pg||
nt|jcwla: Seemingly suit preference implication to that @C7 at T2.|pg||
pc|h8|nt|jaapfr: 3@C on 3@H|pg||
nt|hedyg: oh|pg||
nt|pelu: better if Fantoni takes @CK also and force pd to play major - block the suit at get the setting trick|pg||
nt|rhelle: Muller had 2 options: 1NT to show @s, and 2@d non-forcing. What is best here?|pg||
nt|hvdhaar: minors :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@s was on|pg||
pc|hA|nt|rhelle: Well given the risk that every suit breaks badly, I think it's very aggressive|pg||
nt|rhelle: especially vul - how happy are you if anyone doubles and it comes back to you?|pg||
nt|hvdhaar: South dbl twice, vulnerable, agressive but not unr.|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|hedyg: on bd 11 where Jonsson played 3NT= OR played 2@H +2|pg||
nt|pelu: 2 plans: ruff @SA or find @CJ|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I know he has a stuff club, but he has a very good hand for 2@H|pg||
pc|cA|nt|pelu: wd by Nunes!!!!!!!!!!|pg||
nt|jcwla: Meanwhile Welland and Zia did not match the 6@H on 10 -- so 13 to Netherlands 1.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jaapfr: if so can make with @D 2-2|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes playing on @H might work here|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cK|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cJ|nt|hedyg: or stealing the @H trick|pg||
nt|jaapfr: ??|pg||
nt|hedyg: this is surely not right|pg||
nt|jaapfr: Bob playing his own version:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well i think a shift was clear. only question whether spades or diamonds, and N card shd be SP|pg||
nt|hedyg: Welland just bid 4@H, not 4@d|pg||
nt|hedyg: while Jansma (S) showed his @ss|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1st X was balancing, 2nd X showed a good hand|pg||
nt|czyzyk: Yes bad result for NS, even if he must have somewhat downgraded his @D's holding.|pg||
pc|h9|nt|marlowepi: i think 2D better with a stiff heart, closer decision with a doubleton heart|pg||
nt|hedyg: he did not make this|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: I know...|pg||
nt|hedyg: surely 1NT was down|pg||

nt|pelu: remember that 1@S = 14+|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2NT would be 5+ with fit|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: and one more - Jan is back now|pg||
nt|hedyg: interesting that the CC says A from AK|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|hedyg: De Wijs could have bid 3@H with force in @H|pg||
nt|rhelle: Is it that lucky? looks like a @d dropping or the @c finesse right|pg||
nt|pelu: need @H lead to defeat 3NT - 4@d+4@s + @cA - |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|marlowepi: great auction though contract needs luck to make|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: such soft values maybe quite useless|pg||
pc|hA|nt|hedyg: here W has no space to explore so 3NT does not necessarily show great strength in @s|pg||
nt|hedyg: needs less luck now|pg||
nt|rhelle: and with the opening in North (sound openings) that looks pretty likely|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Fantoni seems surprised|pg||
nt|pelu: ruff and play @h|pg||
pc|h6|nt|rhelle: looks well within the 35% or so range you need to bid a vulnerable game|pg||
nt|rhelle: interesting cards ... the low @s indicates on honour|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not sure how the spade lead means less luck. it didnt tell E anything he didnt already know, and meanwhile it compromises his options|pg||
pc|s2|nt|hedyg: he didnt expect the @s fit|pg||
nt|pelu: and 4@s play easy - 4@h need some hard work|pg||
nt|hedyg: we get to see deep Fantunes at work|pg||
nt|hedyg: sry that is Deep Fantoni|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the more I look the less GF I see |pg||
nt|hedyg: this may take a while|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: some sort of @S raise |pg||
nt|hedyg: he has 10 hcps, fit and good 6 card side suit and if that isnt enough he has a void as well|pg||
nt|sybarra: good enough for me in 2/1 or any other  |pg||
nt|hedyg: how much more do you need?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: exactly... he has a poor @D suit , poor @H suit and a void, but does have @S support|pg||
nt|pelu: would u bid a NF 1NT??????|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: F: "sorry"|pg||
nt|hedyg: (he is always very polite)|pg||
nt|hedyg: i am sure he was planning to show the @s fit next when the 2@H bid came along|pg||
nt|sybarra: No peter I would not bid a non forcing nt |pg||
nt|hedyg: in the mean time Welland found a way to play 3@s on bd 10|pg||
nt|pelu: Dont take that serius - just a joke - I find 2@D a fine bid :):)|pg||
nt|hedyg: sry only 2@ss but -3|pg||
nt|pelu: and IMPs back on the next board (the 4@H on 5-1 fit) here Welland i 3@D making|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: close to play a card now as I see it|pg||
pc|s3|nt|pelu: if making 180/ 200 in 3@C - so best for S to pass - and hope|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes! 11 tricks|pg||
nt|hedyg: must play @ds 3-3 though|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in contrast to weak 2-suited openings, 2-suited opening 2-bids that show a real opener have a lot of merit. the huge difference is that with the former your chances of declaring ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: are far less (esp if u dont have spades), and thus you give opponents too much info. when you have a real hand, it is partner who ratres to be able to make most use of the shape ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: info|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but W should follow with @dK on @dA|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3-3 he can ruff 1 now|pg||
nt|hedyg: if they are 4-2 he is down anyhow|pg||
nt|hedyg: i mean can ruff a small @d|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: if @DK then she should have played @D6 1st round no?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: or if declarer plays a small and ruffs|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but N has to calculate how expensive it is if @d are K10 to j642|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sybarra: duck it now?  you up for that at table?|pg||
nt|sybarra: apparently he is |pg||
nt|rhelle: and the @sJ shows faith - and also how the suit lies|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|marlowepi: moment of truth|pg||
pc|s7|nt|hedyg: all eyes on W|pg||
mc|8|nt|kiwibridge: to add injury to insult :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: did he reaally played @H?|pg||
nt|hedyg: worried @cs dont split|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Next match in about 50 minutes: Neth 1 vs Iceland. Open Muller/De Wijs vs Magnússon/Haraldsson, closed Baldursson/Jónsson vs Jansma/Paulissen|pg||

nt|ralfwil: but now - doesn´t matter|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: they do open 11+ unbalanced normally|pg||

mb|p|nt|roswolf: south took a flyer under pressure in the other room|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@c f1 14+|pg||
mb|1H|nt|jaapfr: 4@S is likely to be made here so -200 not too bad for Dutch|pg||
nt|hedyg: might not need pressure here|pg||

mb|p|nt|hedyg: catching up then|pg||

nt|buffytvs: the @D8 is going to set up here|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|hedyg: W relaying|pg||
nt|hvdhaar: West relaying; 3 S is a "weak" relay; 3 H would have been stronger relay|pg||
pc|h4|nt|kiwibridge: all 6@H needs is 3-2 trumps|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@d was relay|pg||
nt|buffytvs: Dave knows there no future in diamonds, but where can they get 5 ticks from?|pg||
nt|buffytvs: tricks|pg||
pc|hA|nt|hedyg: 1@H= @s 9+ may have a longer suit, 1@s relay|pg||

nt|hedyg: organising these broadcasts|pg||
nt|april7: then only 7 tricks|pg||
nt|pelu: the problem can be that East cant be sure that pd has a 6 card @D|pg||
nt|pelu: 5 card @D|pg||
nt|hedyg: double by W is not penalty, asks pd to bid on|pg||
nt|hedyg: well so much for playing 4@h..|pg||
nt|hedyg: Welland bid 4@H with 3 cards over 3@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: and 11pm New Zealand, yes folks I'll be here for another set|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: courage bid 2@H imo|pg||
mb|2D|an|alerted|nt|hedyg: is it? he passed 1@H so doesnt promise anything but fit|pg||
nt|jaapfr: he hate these 3333333333  distributions:)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: I|pg||
nt|hedyg: thanks to our specs for joining and your helpful comments. we hope you enjoyed the show|pg||
nt|hvdhaar: 12 will be good foor Iceland too|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: we will be back after a short break|pg||
nt|pelu: in OR @DK and @h8 - N @HA - and Played @CQ ducked 2 x by decl|pg||
mb|2S|nt|kiwibridge: we've seen 83 imps traded evenly in 15 boards so not tight bridge but good all the same|pg||
nt|pelu: this last board cost the sensation :OR are ahead of us now :(:(|pg||
nt|hedyg: useless K@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: seems he had already bid his hand with X|pg||
mb|3N|nt|hedyg: oh :( lost the miracle!|pg||
nt|hedyg: all eyes on Muller|pg||
nt|pelu: we have to do a better job next time, Hedy, :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes we do :(|pg||
nt|hedyg: but this way we get the specs from the OR !|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The commentators were fast, that helped|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes our fault, sorry |pg||
nt|pelu: West has by his X sjown extra values, and Muller has a lot of fine controls - so he is close to 6@d|pg||
nt|hedyg: he has also already bid 4@s|pg||
nt|pelu: yes - thats pro and contra - |pg||
nt|hedyg: indeed|pg||
nt|pelu: take a coin|pg||
nt|hedyg: but that 4NT bid does show interest surely|pg||
nt|pelu: @hA is not the best defense|pg||
nt|hedyg: defending vs 4@d could have been fun|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not clear, 10 tricks in spades facing  Axxxxx and three small clubs (if spades 2-1 and maybe if not)|pg||
mb|p|nt|hvdhaar: painless to 9 tricks now|pg||
nt|hedyg: but Fantoni did not promise anything|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: and he saw the 3 level double of his pd|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: Welland found a bid over the 1@H opening and then of course hard to stop Zia|pg||
nt|jaapfr: a very good thing to see was the concentrated tight correct bridge of all (so wd EW:)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|pelu: wd Fantoni|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|nt|hedyg: start with @c?|pg||

pc|c6|pg||
pc|h3|nt|hedyg: looks like a @c lead would have worked better here|pg||
nt|pelu: now @H10 and discard @D|pg||
pc|hT|nt|sybarra: a mad scramble here for 7 tricks |pg||
nt|hedyg: @d lead both tables|pg||

nt|hvdhaar: Makes the hand easy|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 6@D Muller?|pg||
nt|hvdhaar: DBL by Muller to test NS agreements ?|pg||
nt|hedyg: i am sure their agreements are in place :)|pg||
nt|hvdhaar: agree; more or less an insult|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzgq: Sorry Jonsson was thinking, not Muller.|pg||
nt|hvdhaar: Responses are: 0-3, 1, 2 ?|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes|pg||
nt|hedyg: but lets count and recount just to make sure|pg||
nt|hvdhaar: Drijver overbid on 13 and again a loss for the Dutch|pg||
nt|hvdhaar: They reached 4 H|pg||
nt|hvdhaar: Was allowed to make !!|pg||
nt|hedyg: strange after his pd passed 2@d|pg||
nt|hedyg: wow|pg||
nt|marlowepi: double?|pg||
nt|czyzyk: Bad luck for NS in the open room. But grand on two suits splitting 3-2 is not good (diamond lead would essentially require @Hs also spliting)|pg||
nt|buffytvs: yes I agree -- 6 is high enough|pg||
mb|6H|nt|hedyg: greetings to the specs who join us from there now|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: can also be 22-23 balanced or 26 or gf in @c or semi gf in M|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: is Jonsson still breathing?|pg||
nt|buffytvs: if you're in 6@S, the correct way to play trumps is to cash the ace then cross over and run the 9 -- which works well here|pg||
pc|s5|nt|hedyg: 2@d= a major 1 suiter|pg||
nt|aida_mk_nl: enjoy the rest of this session all, I must leave now. Thank you all and see you later :) |pg||
nt|czyzyk: NS play strong @c in the open room and N had the minimum range for his bidding. S could have hoped for a bit more or the grand is close in the worst case|pg||
nt|buffytvs: So much for technology at this table!|pg||
nt|buffytvs: Colbert just bid what he thought was the most likely slam|pg||
pc|s2|nt|vugraphzgq: Calm as ever!|pg||
nt|hedyg: quick claim|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: nice|pg||
nt|hvdhaar: strong psych. play by N : ducked Cl opening and west took the Ace|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i keep looking for the double inside that N hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: expected more from Nunes?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: like what? 5 small hearts and three aces outside?|pg||
nt|hedyg: well he didnt have to have 6 @hs|pg||
nt|hedyg: could have had 5|pg||
pc|s3|nt|hedyg: on 13 7@c was led , he played small from dummy and W went up with the ace|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol too slow again|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty Aida :)|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|sybarra: cu Aida :)|pg||

nt|ralfwil: another slam|pg||
nt|czyzyk: BTW a diamond lead would be more challenging|pg||
mb|1H|nt|hedyg: no trump promotion by playing 4th @h|pg||
mb|d|nt|buffytvs: you can still get home though|pg||
mb|4H|nt|czyzyk: Some problem with scoring|pg||
nt|buffytvs: ruff it, @SA, three hearts ending in hand, and run the @SJ|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|hvdhaar: 1 N game-forcing relay|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzju: it appears the scores are reversed...blame technology, we will try to fix this at earliest opportunity :)|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|nt|hedyg: i think so|pg||
pc|h4|nt|hvdhaar: Will be hard to guess for De Wijs that East's singleton H is an honor|pg||
nt|hvdhaar: D-lay-out is great for 3NT|pg||
nt|hedyg: Bob are you sure of that result?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Yes, Jansma blaimed me for not being surpised|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|hedyg: looked like he 2 more losers no matter what|pg||
nt|pelu: Are u sure Bob that 2@S was making? looks like down 1?|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@H and 1@c|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Last session in about 55 minutes. Open room Schollaardt/Wortel vs Zia/Welland, closed Fantunes vs Verbeek/van Zwol|pg||
nt|hedyg: weird|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@H=@s|pg||
nt|sybarra: must say 3 nt looks easier as long as clubs 4/4|pg||
nt|marlowepi: will be impressive if they get to slam on 2 balanced hands|pg||
nt|hedyg: but then over 2NT he could have bid something else|pg||
nt|hedyg: like 3@d|pg||
nt|ralfwil: in Sweden S has a typical hand for Stenberg 2nt after pass|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h3|nt|hedyg: i am told they do not play drury|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that is OK facng 4th suit opener as here (esp red), but facing 3rd seat it can turn a plus into a minus|pg||
pc|d2|nt|hedyg: NT is wrongsided too on a @c lead|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|hedyg: and the 9@c is an extra entry to the N hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: this lead kills the @H suit|pg||
pc|dK|nt|hedyg: so 2@c here is 10+ balanced or fit|pg||
pc|d4|nt|hedyg: will have to guess @s|pg||
pc|d6|nt|hvdhaar: Luckily not vulnerable undertricks; west's entry for the hearts is gone|pg||
nt|hedyg: but didnt|pg||
nt|pelu: welland didn't check for the 5-3 fit in @S - just jumped to 3NT (after 1@D - 1@S - 1NT)|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4NT = even nr of keycards|pg||
nt|marlowepi: of course they may haveagreements i dont know aboiut, but with both red aces the choice of 3S seems odd|pg||
nt|hedyg: it seems to be forcing showing the 10+ with fit|pg||
nt|marlowepi: would seem better to start showing the goodies as early as possible|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe 2N was slammish and 3S denied shortness?|pg||
nt|hedyg: no alerts|pg||
nt|marlowepi: then this auction would make a lot of sense|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d9|nt|hedyg: as long it makes sense to them :)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|hedyg: 5@c cue|pg||
nt|marlowepi: or maybe 4C was serious slam try so S felt 4N was safe|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|s2|nt|hedyg: 2NT=18+ 5332 or 6322|pg||
pc|s6|nt|hedyg: 5@s denies any red kings now|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes really it is a perfecto mesh given no shortness|pg||
nt|hedyg: Fantoni might worry about A@s in S and no A@h|pg||
nt|hedyg: i am told 5@c= cue and asking re Q@s|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i dont think so. S couldnt bid so much with no major ace|pg||
pc|s9|nt|hedyg: ?|pg||
nt|hedyg: really ducked?|pg||
nt|hedyg: he seems to have denied it|pg||
nt|marlowepi: oh sorry hedy i misread yr comment|pg||
nt|hedyg: np :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: parsing error|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|buffytvs: yes -- Steinberg is the NS pair here, and (surprise!) Korbel is the EW team at this table|pg||
nt|czyzyk: Everything is OK, except the team names which are reversed.|pg||
nt|vugraphzju: exactly we were too far into it to correct it when error was noticed|pg||
nt|buffytvs: yes -- I think you have to reinput everything -- not worth it at this stage|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s3|pc|sK|pc|s4|pg||
nt|buffytvs: anyway -- some of those IMPs are coming back here.  NS bid on to 5@D over 4@H, which went down at the other table|pg||
