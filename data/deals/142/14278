mb|p|nt|xenya: hello Brigitta|pg||
nt|sundiszno: in fact, operator have been interchanged, so we have Daniel here|pg||
mb|1S|nt|xenya: Daniel then|pg||
nt|sundiszno: and Arpad plays tzhe same system with them, so he is a specialist of EW-'s bidding system|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N!|mb|p|nt|xenya: why was E's pass alerted?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|sundiszno: fabog, your answer, pls :)|pg||

nt|xenya: oh i see, thanks|pg||
mb|p|nt|sundiszno: NS playing precision, weak NT|pg||
nt|sundiszno: there is some money at stake, if the national team wins, they take it, if Gamax wins, they donate it to or junior team |pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|1N|nt|geot: Bad board for Taipei in the CR|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: however i guess they play in defense : Pass =  "Strong" or "natural", D =  C+S, 1D=D+S, 1H=H+S, 1S=any garbage not suitable for any other bid.1NT= C+H,2C=C+D,2D=D+H,2H/S=(5)6+,2NT  ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: =  Extreme 2-suiter, I don't think they ever pass weak hands when nonvul.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sundiszno: EW playing a home-grown strong club-based relay system, fabog is the expert of that|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Chinese Taipei can lock up the win if they just lose by less than 39 imps|pg||
nt|geot: West in the CR also overcalled 2@H over a 1 spade opener, and ended up playing ag 4@Sx|pg||
nt|xenya: N is not strong enough to use stayman here, so he passes, and 4-4 spade is missed -- but 1N is a solid contract|pg||
pc|s4|nt|xenya: *a 4-4 spade fit|pg||

pc|s2|pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|hT|pg||
nt|geot: 5@H bid is normal from the East hand|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ritong: the guy who found out about total tricks, jean rené vernes, had also some other ideas, including the delta stuff|pg||

mb|2H!|nt|geot: setting trick as well....|pg||

mb|p|nt|xenya: interesting defence|pg||
mb|p|nt|sundiszno: is it possible to find a bigger @d fit after E raises @ss?|pg||
nt|fabog:  if West says 3 diamonds, but i think in this vulnarability he will not|pg||
nt|xenya: W has a decent 6-carder, yet he prefers to show 9432 |pg||
nt|vugraphzmz: XX is 5 clubs and something else i couldn't hear|pg||
nt|fabog:  2 spades denies good hand|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Asbi PASS=Forcing [if Wu PASSES]|pg||
nt|h_karluk: xx like quasi-game force, sounds Tim Bourke relay based|pg||
pc|hK|nt|sundiszno: is it obligatory to show a 4card @s suit, Árpád?|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hJ|nt|fabog:  depend on distribution and vulnarability, not with 4333 or 4432|pg||
nt|henryb:  I am surprised that North did not bid 3@h|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: RDBL was forced by system|pg||
nt|h_karluk: would you x as W?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ritong: i checked, vernes' book was published in 1966|pg||
nt|sundiszno: polish double - means no better idea than a @s lead|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i guess they are on the way slam after 3@s cue|pg||
pc|s3|nt|geot: You cant play 1NTx with those methods, but occasionally 1NTxx|pg||
nt|geot: Wu reasonably did not want to defend the redoubled contract. Will Huang bid 2@D now, suggesting red suits? Or 2@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: one options = weak 1-suiter pulls the double immediately [via some mechanism]|pg||
nt|sundiszno: or polish pass indeed|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ahollan1: vernes' book wasn't published in english -- but i believe a British author wrote a book based upon Verne|pg||
nt|h_karluk: to me S shld dictate, N described his intentions well|pg||
nt|sundiszno: they are off a keycard and the trump Q|pg||
nt|h_karluk: still 4@s might be good try|pg||
nt|xenya: S has lots of controls -- but does he know how strong N is, and, more important, that he has 4 cards in hearts? |pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think he knows : a) RD, b) 3@s cue|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i was going to ask if EW have discussed WEST runnouts -- obviously not|pg||
nt|xenya: his own hearts are quite weak |pg||
nt|h_karluk: and good news no @d control there, so obv on other suits decent hand|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, probably, Hamdi|pg||
nt|andreasw:  2nt is how strong 16-18?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|h_karluk: 5@d last chance, tho hard to visualize|pg||
nt|xenya: now N is in awkward position perhaps -- what about the diamond control?|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sT|nt|h_karluk: N knows 5@h safe|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c5|nt|h_karluk: with double fit dictated|pg||
nt|xenya: well perhaps he figured things out  |pg||
pc|cA|nt|ahollan1: so Wu's 2@C up-the-line scramble|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|s7|nt|h_karluk: i expected different, ie 4@s by S and 5@d by N, however a matter of style|pg||
nt|xenya: 11 imps to Hungary|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sJ|nt|h_karluk: say 15-17|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 3@C = jumping in after allowing opponents to exchange info|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i.e  why not 2@C over 1@D|pg||
nt|h_karluk: There are two generally acknowledged strengths of the strong club systems|pg||
nt|h_karluk: accuracy in uncontested slam-strength auctions, because the bidding starts at such a low level when opener has a fairly strong hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: or pass over 2@H|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and fact that all other opening bids have their strength capped by the strong club means more accurate judgment and scope for tactical operation both in constructive and ...|pg||

mb|2S|nt|ahollan1: but here we're in context of precision  where 1@D=1+|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: and it seems to work well here, catching 4 card support|pg||
nt|geot: South has a huge hand, and in the CR he bid 5@C over 4@S in the second bidding round. No success.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: when i open 1@S -- partner's pointed suits are flip-flopped|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and after a losing @d Q hook, story over|pg||
nt|h_karluk: declarer finessed vs KQT@H at trick 1|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: I'd start with 2@C then double later.  More flexible to END with double :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: http://www.bridgebum.com/multi.php|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: not quite over, but close, yes|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ritong: claro que si|pg||
nt|geot: 3@S pre-emptive. Huang hopes for an ace with partner, but anyway 4@S is ok.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 2@s in original theory Inviting game in hearts if that is opener's suit, but signoff if opener's suit is spades. Opener can rebid 3@h (signoff), 4@H (signoff), or Pass with spades. ...|pg||
pc|s3|pc|c7|nt|xenya: he finessed the 10 |pg||
nt|sundiszno: no, playin the 9 is good against QT and KT, and bad against KQ with the opening leader|pg||
nt|xenya: that's what i mean -- 9 is the right card |pg||
nt|sundiszno: 1@d meant 4+ @hs, a kib asked|pg||
nt|h_karluk: lead M.U.D.|pg||
nt|xenya: same thing might happen here, in theory, but i don't think it will|pg||
nt|h_karluk: declarer have the luxury losing a @d |pg||
nt|sundiszno: if east getting the lead, and plays a small @h, what will you play?|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|geot: same auction. Most likely push, but there are only three top losers. |pg||
pc|dA|pc|dT|nt|3for3: when declarer tries to draw trump, his heart ruff in the dummy disappears.  can still guess hearts for 1 loser though|pg||
nt|geot: I am counting one in trumps, not practical to solve that one....|pg||
nt|ahollan1: since this is public forum i don't think i'll admit i would NOT open 1@S|pg||
nt|ritong: mm...say you draw two trumps|pg||
nt|geot: We will win 5@C:) seeing all the cards.|pg||
nt|ritong: then a top @h|pg||
nt|ritong: after that, a @h to the 8 caters with all, seems|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|h_karluk: i don't think such special 2@d agreements can cause to catastrophic results|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ahollan1: Huang known to be on minimum, so must be distributional for @S.  since Wu 3@S bid show 4, Asbi may actually be able to read  5161 or 5251|pg||
nt|geot: He will pull the trumps now, and then low heart from dummy. When the Q comes he is practically safe by playing a low to the nine. Unless West has played the ! from Q-9.......|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry -- Henri did already say that|pg||
nt|ritong: np|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|sA|nt|geot: Playing the Q from Q-9 in this situation is the only defence to make declarer go wrong. If the nine comes he will bang down the other honor and concede only one heart. |pg||

nt|sundiszno: seeing @cAKQxxx in his hand, is it a good idea?|pg||
nt|sundiszno: if there is not a club lead, you can strip the majors, and give south a @c, to lead away from @dK, as a kib suggests|pg||
nt|h_karluk: well, in my 1st club tournament tho i finished it with 58%, i passed my pertner's cue tho i agreed it as fit+gf, but that was 36 years ago, that 3NT would be quite friendly ...|pg||

nt|h_karluk: csatlos did you play gambling 3N with Hittman?|pg||

nt|h_karluk: @s lead might cost them expensive in case they landed 6|pg||
