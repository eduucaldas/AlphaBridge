nt|lml: I have to say the womens is more interesting in that they are all the place in the bidding|pg||
nt|buffytvs: East opened 2@S in 3rd, and ended up in 3@C dbld going for 500|pg||
nt|buffytvs: NS can make 4@H fairly comfortably|pg||
nt|lml: me too in the womens and they also opened 2@S|pg||
nt|lml: but this time everybody sat for the double|pg||
nt|buffytvs: and...?|pg||
nt|lml: it could have been 1100 but somehow they managed only 800|pg||
nt|buffytvs: lol|pg||
nt|lml: so what is the "normal contract" 4@H I think|pg||
nt|buffytvs: looks like it|pg||
nt|lml: so -500 isnt a bad score at all|pg||
nt|buffytvs: PO Sundelin thought they could get 800, but he didn't elaborate on how|pg||
nt|lml: north south has 7 top tricks and needs to cross ruff 3 more|pg||
nt|lml: for 4@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: why is 2@S so attractive... it must be the Marty Bergen influence|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|2C|nt|buffytvs: dunno -- don't like the clubs myself -- adn you know I'm not a shy preemptor|pg||
nt|lml: Paul failed to find the obvious bid so Judy got to open 1@S|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|lml: I think they are about to bid the other major|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|lml: I like 3@H good bid|pg||
nt|buffytvs: playing a forcing club, Judy decides she's good enough to jump rebid hearts|pg||
mb|4C|nt|lml: Judy has prime cards|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|lml: but with Nick as a passed hand she is DONE|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|buffytvs: they might get to 6 after this start... -- 1 loser, but do they have 12 tricks?|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lml: a ninth heart would have made a big difference|pg||
nt|lml: so now we get to see Judy play dummy|pg||
nt|buffytvs: she didn't need that much -- Kx of spades, AQxx of hearts gives you a play|pg||
nt|lml: you know what they say about perfect cards|pg||
nt|lml: after the club cuebid her chances were a lot worse|pg||
nt|buffytvs: yes -- actually, a club cuebid wasn't really good news -- 3@S would have been much more encouraging to hear|pg||
nt|lml: yes|pg||
nt|lml: with only an eight card fit it is hard to bring spades home when partner has shortness|pg||

mb|p|mb|3C|nt|lml: yes I also saw the same overcall which does seem normal to me|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I don't like passing 8-card suits...|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: well in Judys defence so 8 card suits are better than others|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|buffytvs: remember the story of David Silver and the 9-card suit, which he never bid?  Playing with Bruce Gowdy|pg||
nt|lml: 6 red seems normal but 7 hearts is possible|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|lml: and if you bid 3@S I will make it on you|pg||
nt|buffytvs: yes you will :)|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|buffytvs: but we'll be in 7@S down 5|pg||
nt|lml: janicki is wondering about that spade singleton|pg||
mb|4N|nt|buffytvs: yes -- funny they have 11 spades and no-one bid them|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: they'll stop in 6 when they find the @HQ is missing|pg||
nt|lml: so knowing you are on a nine card fit do you want to be in grand missing the !Q?|pg||
nt|lml: Q|pg||
nt|buffytvs: no - not unless you're playing it|pg||
nt|lml: :)|pg||
nt|lml: you always did like doing that to me!|pg||
nt|buffytvs: rofl|pg||
nt|lml: its a surprise I dont have even more grey hair|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|buffytvs: so 30 years of playing bridge with you is the reason I do have grey hair?|pg||
nt|lml: you didnt know that|pg||
nt|lml: ?|pg||
nt|lml: why does answering aces take so long|pg||
nt|lml: Priebe knows how many keycards he has |pg||
nt|buffytvs: 1430 or 3014? must remember...|pg||
nt|lml: Paul can't really count 13 tricks|pg||
nt|lml: but he could take a GS try here|pg||
nt|lml: and ask for the @HQ|pg||
nt|buffytvs: doesn't need much -- the @HQ and a decent diamond suit|pg||
mb|6H|nt|lml: he is thinking that right now|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|buffytvs: didn't even try|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: I think he should try actually|pg||
nt|lml: with partner having bid a forcing notrump I think he decided it was unlikely he could have enough|pg||
nt|buffytvs: make the @CQ the @HQ and it's laydown|pg||
nt|lml: but I agree with you ... except you know what happens to people who bid grand slams|pg||
nt|lml: they find out the opponents were defending 3@S doubled or something|pg||
nt|buffytvs: yeah - they're in game at the other table|pg||
nt|buffytvs: but remember it was West who made the first slam try|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|lml: interesting.   She didn't lead her singleton|pg||
nt|buffytvs: let's be fair, this is the right contract -- just don't like the way they got there|pg||
nt|lml: I think its okay|pg||
nt|lml: bidding|pg||
pc|s9|nt|lml: odd not to lead the stiff club though|pg||
nt|lml: but east did bid clubs|pg||
nt|buffytvs: Paul probably tanked over 5@C, so Judy inferred that they weren't missing any aces|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sA|pg||
nt|lml: and she didn't want to pick anything up|pg||

mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|lml: dont think they are playing the same boards|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|buffytvs: no -- they have only 2 sessions a day|pg||
nt|lml: can east-west find a sensible contract like 4@H|pg||
nt|lml: or 3NT|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|buffytvs: note the @C9 here, which makes 3NT playable even after a spade lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: east-west might be able to get their 4 tricks though|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|lml: and that is a good start|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|d3|pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|2C|nt|buffytvs: The auction I watched earlier here was very interesting|pg||
mb|2H|nt|lml: if you get to game you can make it east-west|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: It started 1@D-2@H-dbl-3@C and now West had a big problem|pg||
nt|lml: so 5@D or 3NT?|pg||
nt|buffytvs: He bid 3@H, and none of us we quite sure what that should mean|pg||
nt|buffytvs: they got to 5@D|pg||
mb|2N|nt|lml: 2@H!|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: abuse of vulnerability|pg||
nt|buffytvs: lead-directing :)|pg||
nt|lml: 3NT looks quite good on the lie of the cards|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|lml: 2NT might have been Lebensohl here|pg||
nt|lml: was it alerted operator?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjv: yes i believe so|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: so Paul has decided to just play a partscore with the @CK pretty ugly|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|pc|cQ|pc|c9|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|sA|pc|s5|pc|s2|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|lml: he bid his hand|pg||
