nt|sybarra: was clearly before I got out of bed,  its only 714a here now |pg||

nt|marlowepi: W opened in 3rd seat at favorable|pg||
nt|hedyg: X= i underbid my hand ?|pg||
nt|jcwla: W white on red in third, E does not have trump trick - I agree with your assessment, Marshall.|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: guess we are watching a recording :)|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mich-b: East knows that East will not have 4 card @S support|pg||
nt|hedyg: the balancing double by Fantoni allowed E to bid again and get to play in his 7 card suit|pg||
nt|mich-b: he would raise to 2@S with that rather than pass|pg||
nt|mich-b: so he prefers the 7 card suit , to the 4-3 fit|pg||

pc|h8|pc|h3|nt|hedyg: tricky lead!|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: those @C's are only useful as trumps|pg||
nt|hedyg: for sure|pg||
nt|hedyg: @cs 3-2, @ss on side..|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Fantunes play what are called Slavinsky leads very tricky|pg||
nt|hedyg: and they only underlead aces when it is right :p|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: of course|pg||
nt|mich-b: best for he defense is to stay passive, and let declarer work on the @S suit himself|pg||
nt|hedyg: E surely has a singleton @H or void, the question is where is the 10@H (for Fantoni)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: not normally this slow when defending a part score|pg||
nt|hedyg: Fantoni? LOL|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: even he|pg||
nt|hedyg: yesterday there was a miracle when the table where both Fantoni and Muller played finished before the other table|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: rehi all |pg||
nt|jcwla: Hi Shirley.|pg||
nt|hedyg: re|pg||
nt|marlowepi: doubling on the diamonds very dubious because S has announced trick source in hearts and E has 3 small|pg||
nt|marlowepi: no D is o nly chance|pg||
nt|marlowepi: now|pg||
nt|hedyg: might play @c|pg||
nt|pelu: look at that dummy - East prob play @cs|pg||
nt|marlowepi: D only chance|pg||
nt|hedyg: or even @H in case S has K@s and W A@H|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i predict he will play diamond king|pg||
nt|pelu: Mullers best chance : I take my X back :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S marked with one diamond at most|pg||
nt|hedyg: how can that beat it?|pg||
nt|hedyg: i am with Peter :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: undo the double |pg||
nt|marlowepi: in fact, since S is known to have 6 strong hearts from the auction, his pass marks him with this shape almost surely|pg||
nt|pelu: the best chance is 4-6-1-2 in S and then he sh play C to kill Ss hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: diamond lead is only chance because declarer might play W for three clubs|pg||
nt|hedyg: declarer will play to win|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that shape is almost impossible,|pg||
nt|pelu: Hi Marschall - have a bet (just a coke) - No @D from East :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: on a @d back he can play 2 @hs to disc 1 @d and ruff 3, last ruff W overruffs with ace and thats all|pg||
nt|marlowepi: when we look at the auction that S has followed, it is clear he was always preared to bid 5C, and he did not open with six strong hearts which almost surely means 4 spades. hence ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4603|pg||
nt|pelu: No Marshal, 2@H = 10-13 HCP|pg||
nt|hedyg: S needed 10 hcps to open with, they do not have weak openings for 6 card suits|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes there are many things he can do to make as cards lie Hedy, but they won;t all work if W has three clubs|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well dont they play multi?|pg||
nt|hedyg: sure they will! he just has to have 2 @hs|pg||
nt|hedyg: could (should) have covered|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hello Marshall!|pg||

nt|mich-b: the way to get to 6@C , is for South to double, North to show values via Lebensohl, and South to complete the description by bidding @Cs , going past 3NT|pg||
nt|hedyg: need to remove the @c ruff|pg||
nt|hedyg: for most players 2NT would be weak|pg||
nt|hedyg: (lebensohl)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: quess @HJ or @S9|pg||
nt|hedyg: Fantoni knows that Nunes does not have the J@s|pg||
nt|jaapfr: @DJ mb too DD|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: they'll be pushing to finish before the next scheduled start time|pg||
nt|hedyg: so playing @s is not tempting|pg||
nt|sybarra: now where to begin |pg||
pc|c3|nt|kiwibridge: "a card"|pg||
nt|jaapfr: not too DD for fantoni:)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lestergold: at first yes but the second bid would have corrected taht impression|pg||
nt|hedyg: he could still have 4+@s and long @ds|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: WOW 7@H reached|pg||
nt|hvdhaar: Pity that Rob Helle isn't watching; he's a Tarzan expert and encouraged Bauke en Simon to start using the system (some 5 years ago)|pg||
nt|hedyg: then it should be his duty to be here with us!|pg||
nt|hedyg: here 1@c is 2+|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: tell us about Tarzan please Hans|pg||
pc|c9|nt|sybarra: ugh,  as we can see probably low @D works better |pg||
nt|jcwla: Not free of pitfalls.  Meanwhile, 1 was a push when 3NT made in the OR, also with the help of a @S trick.|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes Peter sry|pg||
pc|cT|pc|d4|nt|hedyg: claiming  all but the @hs|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|hedyg: went all the way to dummy to play K@D?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: may as well go light now|pg||
nt|lestergold: With 4 spades and 5+ dims he would bid 4@s not risking the 5 level|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Missed it again, I'm very sorry.|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok np|pg||
nt|hedyg: Mike he could have a better hand with @s and @d and not want to just bid 4@s?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: pretty tough contract to play i would say|pg||
pc|hK|nt|hedyg: now J@H|pg||
nt|jaapfr: would love to hear his thinking analysis in these both tricks:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: if they play @s to ace and a @D back he can ruff and play K@C since S surely has A@c and no more @hs|pg||
nt|lestergold: possible but more important to use the 4n bid in the manner i described that standard bidding to show good dims|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|marlowepi: i think S should have won the D to play hearts|pg||
nt|hedyg: what for?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe not |pg||
nt|hedyg: they are not going anywhere|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well i was thinking, to avoid this defence|pg||
pc|h3|nt|hedyg: claim|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|pelu: the winning line is (I hope :) to play @s to finess in trick 3 and then @d3 from hand|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s9|nt|marlowepi: but jack of diamonds would allow H to go away while N ruffs, so S was correct, my error|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E not thrilled with W play at trick one|pg||
nt|hedyg: low @H was encouraging by E|pg||
nt|ralfwil: claim...|pg||

pc|sT|nt|jaapfr: provided @HJ NOW:)|pg||
nt|mich-b: now he can play the @HJ safely|pg||

nt|hedyg: obviously LOL|pg||
nt|sybarra: perhaps better to struggle with the rebid by opening something other than 1 nt |pg||

mb|1S|nt|sybarra: aida,  could paulissen have opened 1 club on the hand?  |pg||
nt|aida_mk_nl: no|pg||
nt|hedyg: they play Polish @c|pg||
mb|2D|nt|aida_mk_nl: he can open 1@C if his hand in 16+ with 5@C|pg||
nt|pelu: in the syetem he was almost forced to open 1NT|pg||
nt|aida_mk_nl: then rebid 2@C|pg||
nt|aida_mk_nl: he could open 1@D |pg||
nt|sybarra: he had 16,  |pg||
nt|aida_mk_nl: then he downgraded his hand probably|pg||
nt|hedyg: Jansma feeling robbed|pg||
nt|sybarra: 1 @D in their system might have been better then  I am sure it will be discussed|pg||
nt|hedyg: on the other hand Nunes is in 3rd seat, he could have anything|pg||
nt|hedyg: EW can make 5 @ss|pg||
nt|hedyg: and 5@cs|pg||
nt|sybarra: someone has to get into the bidding for that |pg||
nt|pelu: still red against green - Nunes is a conservativ bidder (no junior-style)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: E based on last hand should have opened 1@C|pg||
nt|sybarra: dont think he can open 1 @C |pg||
nt|aida_mk_nl: I am sure paulissen made  the best bid in his view, it was just unlucky @H distribution|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree Aida |pg||
mb|2S|nt|hedyg: yes very interesting board|pg||
nt|jaapfr: this ending in 3@D or so|pg||

nt|marlowepi: strong|pg||
nt|hedyg: so much for 4@hs|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3H seems about right to me|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@d = unbalanced with @ds|pg||
nt|pelu: couldn't he bid 3@H (invitational?) - a strong hand would for sure start with X|pg||
nt|hedyg: rare to see a precision 2@c opening with a 5 card major|pg||

nt|hedyg: ok you can beat 5 by leading @H as N and S underleads his AQJ@D|pg||
mb|3H|nt|hedyg: either 5+ @ds and a singleton somewhere or 4 4 4 1|pg||
nt|marlowepi: or with 2NT|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3nt on EW no problems with the block in @h|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: no|pg||

nt|hedyg: Bob was 1@d alerted?|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: yes xfrs cc here|pg||
nt|mich-b: I am a bit surprised they had no way to take out to 3@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: He tried to bid 2 clubs over 2 NT|pg||
nt|hedyg: seems Nunes saw a 1NT rebid|pg||
nt|mich-b: normally with South's hand one would expect 3@D to play better than 2NT|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty Bob|pg||
nt|jaapfr: agree|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Nunes that is.|pg||
nt|hedyg: right as he would have over 1NT|pg||

nt|marlowepi: 53 hearts more likely than 62|pg||
mb|3S|nt|hedyg: playing transfers he could bid 2@d and over 2@H 3 @H|pg||

nt|vugraphzgq: Fantoni: your first words where, if it's possible!|pg||
nt|hedyg: LOL|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: were*|pg||
nt|hedyg: he thinks 3@H=4cards|pg||
nt|sybarra: watch the carding here,  all important |pg||
nt|hedyg: 5@d ended all hope for EW|pg||
nt|pelu: clever 5@D - if N pass I exp that Paulissen would have X|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|kiwibridge: if that's Ice-Relay it just sank when the ice melted|pg||
pc|h8|nt|jcwla: E has nicely sitting cards, yes, but a real minimum hand.  Might summon up 3@H (thru some sequence) as W with that length and texture.|pg||
nt|hedyg: not that Muller would accept the invite|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes he could, but i don;t see why that should stop him from making the value bid of 3H when he isnt laying transfers|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1 spec tells me he remembers Belladonna opening a superprecision 2@c with 6 6 in 1973........|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|hedyg: nice spots in @H|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: even the great Bella had one lapse in his career ?|pg||

pc|hK|nt|hedyg: 9@H a giveaway|pg||

nt|hedyg: OR catching up with us|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: 1H - ? - 4@C would do it|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok 4@H is down as well|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: but much preferable contract|pg||
nt|hedyg: indeed|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 3rd option would be an initial pass :)|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: claimed on the finesses Bob?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Uhuh|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: He played the diamonds..|pg||
nt|hedyg: Fantoni could have had 4@cs and 5@ds in the same hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: this could be sporting|pg||
nt|lc: As shown, he would have gone down (if he ducked a heart).|pg||

mb|p|nt|ralfwil: As S I had expected @hQx from P when he bid 3@h|pg||
mb|1C|nt|roswolf: east should bid spades naturally for me|pg||
nt|hedyg: no way to make 6 that way|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Want me to ask them afterwards?|pg||
nt|pelu: didn't he loose a @h and a @c?|pg||
nt|jcwla: On Board 5 in OR, 1@D by E and by W........ 4@H.|pg||

nt|hvdhaar: DBL - 3 S ?|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@s=11-15|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i agree Ralf. in fact the main advantage of double is that you get to learn more about N shape. if 1N denied four spades (i am not sure it did), then the fact that pd did not pass ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the double  of 3D suggests pd's clubs are legitimate|pg||

nt|vugraphzgq: he "gambled", there was some.. relief.|pg||
mb|3S|nt|hedyg: maybe a squeeze on S?|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: as I would have bid 1N rather than X....|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: guess Bob missed a pass somewhere|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3C over the fiurst double didnt have to mean much at all|pg||
mb|4S|nt|lc: A system triumph here, since 1@H is a beautiful contract. (As opposed to 2NT P P P )|pg||
nt|pelu: 1@h = 14+, X = neg|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: 4@S?|pg||
nt|roswolf: methinks n/s have had a foft ride in the bidding|pg||
nt|roswolf: soft|pg||
nt|hedyg: strange pass by E imo|pg||
nt|lc: Too early in the morning here -- I think West too light for 2NT  :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3N a somewhat hungry call here|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|hedyg: 1@d was relay|pg||
nt|hedyg: i am told Drijver apologized after a short discussion|pg||
nt|hedyg: Bob undo pls|pg||
nt|marlowepi: with a bad suit and no aces, transfer to see if pd likes it. if she doesnt, 3C will be enough|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: agree - no barrage made it easier for n/s|pg||
nt|jaapfr: nasty sys here in this situation|pg||
nt|jaapfr: for ew|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: But you never know, I can ask him afterwards.|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: overtake just in case|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|hedyg: but this contract will not make|pg||
nt|jaapfr: with natural bidding it would be automatic 4@S by EW down 1|pg||
nt|hedyg: so 4@H a good sac vs 3@s =|pg||
nt|jaapfr: :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: also against 2@S|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@s= 11-14 4 @ss|pg||
nt|Walddk4: How did declarer make 9 tricks in 1NT on board 6?|pg||
nt|hedyg: but surely 3@s would not show strength by E|pg||
nt|jaapfr: operator did:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: He didn't|pg||
nt|hedyg: we dont know :(|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Bob was going to correct it Roland|pg||
nt|Walddk4: How many did he actually make?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 7|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1NN=  is the code|pg||
nt|jaapfr: still a chance 4@H will be made here|pg||
nt|hedyg: unlucky all minor honours off side|pg||
nt|hedyg: ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Sorry, laptop decided to have his own will.|pg||
nt|hedyg: pls correct that result|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: After they finish playing|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok|pg||
nt|hedyg: laptops are tricky things|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: can't make 4@H can he?|pg||
nt|hedyg: he should not|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: all suits wrong|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: had he bid 1N he wouldn't have this problem|pg||
nt|hedyg: the maximum he can make is 9 tricks as far as i can see|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: King holds, followed by another spade, 8H QH, 2H AH, KH, 2C T Q|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: If that's understandable|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes it is!|pg||
nt|hedyg: and E switches to @D|pg||
nt|hedyg: can disc 1@d on a @c but should lose 2@cs, 2@ds and a @s|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Muller is thinking...|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Yup 5D|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: double swing for 11 on the 3N hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: for the jack, followed by 5C for the ace, and another D|pg||
nt|hedyg: so this should be -2 |pg||
nt|hedyg: yes Gary, 5@D EW in OR?|pg||

nt|hedyg: it is wonderful that the Dutch have these generous sponsors!|pg||
nt|hedyg: (White House)|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@d= (9)10-13 unbalanced|pg||
mb|1S|nt|kiwibridge: 7 even|pg||
nt|roswolf: and now a simple slam hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: why only 6?|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@D = 10-13|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@c 2+|pg||
mb|2D|nt|jaapfr: 7@S|pg||
nt|sybarra: one of the few countries that have such sponsors|pg||
nt|lc: E-W have a slam -- but have gone conservative.|pg||
nt|pelu: 0.1 sec again Hedy :)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|Walddk4: 4HW-2  is the code|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Bob trys our patience for the umpteenth time :(|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 110 coming|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@c would be gf|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@c is invite|pg||
mb|2N!|an|Lebensohl|nt|kiwibridge: 2@c FG|pg||
nt|jaapfr: and they will bid that|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@c = gf with @c or balanced or fit @s|pg||
nt|hedyg: only -1 Bob? not -2?|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@s, 2@ds and 2@cs|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: A light 2@H here.|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|marlowepi: N obviously also feared doubleton heart in S hand as he did not play a heart right away when in with spade|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@h was down|pg||
mb|3S|nt|hedyg: can now disc a @s on @H|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Typo, changed it.|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok ty|pg||
nt|hedyg: he is trying hard, it's a very tough job!|pg||
nt|marlowepi: ok 100 coming|pg||
nt|hedyg: would you find the @H lead?|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: and a claim at trick 1|pg||
nt|lc: It's easy for us to say that West should have balanced, but we see all 52 cards.|pg||
nt|sybarra: being red,  not easy to jump into this bidding maybe|pg||
nt|lc: South could have had some of those hearts that East has.|pg||
nt|hedyg: not a great @H suit he has|pg||
nt|lc: There is an expression to cover West's decision: "It is dangerous to bid, it is dangerous to pass."  This time it was the latter.|pg||
nt|hedyg: nobody can accuse Jansma of lack of courage :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: W is in trouble|pg||
nt|hedyg: how about pass?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: dont need to|pg||
nt|hedyg: small from even withough honour or odd with|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: but lowest spade seems very dangerous|pg||
nt|hedyg: it is systemic|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 3NT serious asking for cuebids|pg||
nt|hedyg: and make on a @c guess, but needs a very good guess|pg||
pc|dK|nt|pelu: as I see - no lead can defeat 5@D by force|pg||
nt|jcwla: A reasonable question to ask is "How will this do if pd has seven points?"|pg||
nt|hedyg: tricky @C, would play same from A@c|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@H asked for @c?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Q of clubs and spade back may be best chance, as N would misguess. but that opening lead would be.........difficult to find:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he shd play low despite opening bid|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i mean overcall|pg||
nt|hedyg: hard to believe Muller is handing him the @c suit on a platter|pg||
nt|hedyg: double was t/o for the black suits|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok Muller could be a bit stronger..|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: indeed|pg||
nt|hedyg: but they play rev smith|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|nt|jaapfr: IF knowing 2 clubs and AK K THen we all bid 7@S:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4NT= even number of keycards|pg||
nt|lc: It's not much fun to be -110 or -130 when you have 1430 available (although, N-S have a good sacrifice against slam).|pg||
nt|hedyg: i was betting on a @s lead|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|marlowepi: harder to believe he is quickly playing a club from the ace. also he needs much more to be the case to play for club ace on|pg||
nt|pelu: wd|pg||
pc|s2|nt|hedyg: if he can assume that W has 5 @hs then the small @H was preferential|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but communications?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: odd way to play the clubs|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|nt|hedyg: so 9@C= i dont want @s|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|hedyg: 5@c= Q@S?|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|hedyg: takes guts to bid 3@s|pg||
nt|aida_mk_nl: :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: they always play that as short?|pg||
nt|hedyg: could not be fit?|pg||
nt|sybarra: but the suit was set |pg||
nt|sybarra: in hearts|pg||
nt|aida_mk_nl: yes suit is set and that is @H|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok ty|pg||
nt|marlowepi: would block suit if someone has A9xx|pg||
pc|d6|nt|hedyg: 5@D = yes and K@D?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: the crux of this board is the xx of S in @C during bidding|pg||
nt|hedyg: oh 5@c cue and 5@d cue|pg||
nt|hedyg: the lead gave him his 7th trick|pg||
nt|hedyg: he had no trick in @H if he had to play the suit himself|pg||
nt|hedyg: so never show @s fit|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d2|pg||
nt|jaapfr: and not a 3 card or 4|pg||
nt|hedyg: he got his ruff going now|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if club king holds there is still a lot of work to do|pg||
pc|dT|nt|hvdhaar: Interesting point: Muller could DBL 1 H with the blacks, what's the difference. De Wijs assumed Muller had H too for this sequence|pg||
nt|hvdhaar: which was (a bit) true indeed|pg||
nt|hedyg: but here he is just balancing|pg||
nt|hedyg: where as if he doubled earlier he might have a better hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: like maximum pass|pg||
nt|marlowepi: how fortunate that dummy had diamond ace so that the club-spot plays didnt have to show count|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|hedyg: 5NT asks for Q@s for 7|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: very nice play will be shorter than bidding?|pg||
nt|hedyg: instant claim|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: even with Fantoni declarer|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes even |pg||
nt|hedyg: what is RNC?|pg||
nt|hedyg: both N and S reverse smithed|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I like @dJ better than @dQ|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|sybarra: guys unfortunately I have to leave,  business issues over whelming me today (not my orginal plan) |pg||
nt|marlowepi: smith shouldnt take prcedence over count when count is a crucial issue, which it often is|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||

nt|roswolf: this looks a good result for the italians next door|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcmax: It appears E led the @HA against 5@D and then switched to a low @C. That way declarer had to lose only 1 @C-trick|pg||

nt|Walddk2: In case declarer has 7 diamonds and 2 clubs I suppose|pg||

nt|Walddk2: or 8 diamonds rather|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sA|pc|s7|nt|daman: he can ruff out the @S King perhaps |pg||

mb|1D|an|up to 19|nt|lc: Almost a textbook weak-2 here. (or Multi)|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok np|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: multi it is|pg||
nt|lc: The big weakness of Multi is that with a weak-2 in @S it often allows opponents in with a @H overcall -- but here, South just didn't have enough.|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes pls correct|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: it says 1NT =, it's correct|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes|pg||
mb|1H!|nt|hedyg: yes Bob|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S!|an|hearts|nt|hedyg: why pass by Brink?|pg||
nt|pelu: why not 2@S from W?|pg||
nt|lc: If 2@S was pass/correct, that would seem to be a better choice.  |pg||
nt|hedyg: would we all have bid 2@H as W, i would have bid 2@s (positive in @H)|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@S = P/C|pg||
nt|hedyg: oh well, we all agree|pg||
nt|lc: So, strange to bid 2@H|pg||
nt|lc: Gives an extra "round" of bidding making it easier for opps to judge.|pg||
nt|pelu: if we all agree - not good :):)|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@HX= takeout of @H|pg||
nt|lc: So important to thoroughly know your agreement against these Multi auctions.|pg||
nt|aida_mk_nl: not really probably typo, they play optional rkc|pg||
nt|hedyg: there was no play, quick claim|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: They claimed without play previous game.|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: super max for 2@C (11-15 and 6 card suit)|pg||
nt|hedyg: if they go on like this we will have a 3rd miracle today and Muller / Fantoni will finish before the other table again!|pg||
nt|jcwla: If they bid this slam against you, get back into bed, pull the covers up around you, and don't come out for 24 hours.|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@d looks right|pg||
mb|2C!|an|4-th suit|nt|hedyg: 3@d???|pg||
nt|hedyg: is this a transfer?|pg||
nt|lc: Perhaps they treat the X as a strong notrump, and over interference they play x-fer lebensohl --  that, or a typo.|pg||
nt|hedyg: strange IF the double shows short @hs|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: No typos|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|lc: This surely tests the partnership agreements.  Even a long-time experienced partnership such as N-S can have trouble with such auctions.|pg||
nt|hedyg: bd 7 EW are in 5@c XX|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty specs :)|pg||
nt|lc: Sounds like we'll lose everyone watching.  Who wouldn't want to watch 5@C XX!|pg||
nt|hedyg: LOL|pg||
nt|hedyg: we all know 5@c XX makes so not really exciting|pg||
nt|pelu: just 11 tricks from the top - and some play for 12 :(|pg||
nt|lc: So, how does 5@CXX compare to the 1430 that was available in 6@H?|pg||
nt|lc: Maybe it is more fun to see if Baldursson-Jonsson will play in a 4-1 fit. :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: much more fun|pg||
nt|jcwla: 6 a push at 3@S making.|pg||
nt|pelu: 1@C several poss - here balanced 15+|pg||
nt|sybarra: 12 off the top |pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: this will be a struggle|pg||
nt|hedyg: they open 1@c with 12.14 balanced|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@d stopped Fantoni bidding 3@s|pg||
nt|pelu: super optimist - going for slam opp a passed pd|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@d bid not a surprise for Muller|pg||
nt|pelu: but he is correct|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 180 is there hedy|pg||
nt|hedyg: not anymore :)|pg||

nt|lc: What if North runs to 4@D, though, thinking 3@D was natural!|pg||
nt|hedyg: hmmm|pg||
nt|hedyg: Jansma trying to scare them into 4@h|pg||
nt|pelu: last time EW X - they was close to push opp in 5@c (4@c +1) - no danger here for EW|pg||
nt|hedyg: 12-14 NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|hvdhaar: Board 6 got costly for NS indeed|pg||
nt|hedyg: did anybody bring coffee?|pg||

mb|3H|nt|lc: Are they using screens? (I doubt it for this kind of match) --  it would be nice to know the table action on who is alering what to whom.|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: Bob usually shows the alerts|pg||
nt|hedyg: not this time though|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Yes, screens, I'll add the alerts.|pg||
nt|lc: Well, if ever there was an alert, 3@D had to be one.  :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@d did too|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Iceland is a strong bridge nation. The proudest moment in Icelandic bridge was obviously in 1991 when the team won the World Championships (Bermuda Bowl) in Yokohama, Japan, by ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: defeating Poland in the final|pg||
nt|hedyg: with @d lead as well if you are talking re play last hand Shirley|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Baldursson and Jónsson were in that team, but not as partners|pg||
nt|hedyg: this wont be pretty to watch|pg||

nt|pelu: for sure De wijs didn't exp singelton @s by pd - thjey have 10 card an never bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: that lead saved a trick|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 5@H?|pg||
nt|pelu: Welland in 3NT on the 6-3 fit in @h - making after a @c lead - @s-lead would defeat|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: ....|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Missed it, 3 tricks within 5 seconds.|pg||
nt|hedyg: what is happening Bob?|pg||
nt|hedyg: :(|pg||
nt|hedyg: you could ask them nicely to slow down?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|hedyg: Jansma showed either 2 cards in @S or singleton|pg||
nt|lc: We can see that East can throw minors on the @H's -- but -- it won't be clear to him.|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: I was born in 1991,|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: have a glass of my excellent Chardonnay :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: No, they are thinking very long on a lot of the problems, resulting in play everything very fast to catch up.|pg||
pc|d7|pc|s3|nt|hedyg: lol ty|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|hedyg: disced an ace|pg||
nt|lc: He is probably thinking : "If @S run, down anyway, so let me make sure not to throw away a minor."|pg||
nt|lc: For example, a @D discard would be disastrous if declarer had @DAKQxx.|pg||
nt|lc: I suppose a @C discard is unlikely to hurt in most layouts.|pg||
nt|pelu: can W signal in "hs that he like the @S-lead?|pg||
nt|lc: Smith echo -- hi-lo in @H would say "Like @S"|pg||
nt|lc: I suppose having a 2nd space could mean liking them.|pg||
nt|hedyg: no Smith on their CC|pg||
nt|pelu: LH = even - no "smith"|pg||
nt|lc: Anyway, Baldursson was surely pleased to see a @S discard.  :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: and Lavinthal|pg||
nt|pelu: so S sh take another @H and hope that East will disc a @s|pg||
nt|lc: sounds good to me.|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: I lost it.|pg||
nt|pelu: sorry N - but same hope :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe not|pg||

pc|dK|nt|roswolf: defence take their fill of tricks|pg||
nt|jaapfr: @S8 ends the story|pg||
nt|hedyg: ohhhhh again :(|pg||
nt|hedyg: so he must have disced another @S|pg||
nt|lc: One @S discard meant 500.  Another would have been 200.|pg||

nt|Walddk4: 15.45 is CET, in 3 hours and 50 minutes|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes -1 now|pg||
nt|hvdhaar: East has at the most INV strenght or else he would have started with 1 N (GF relay)|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|lc: In 3NT there appear to be only 8 tricks.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|lc: Normal play picks up the @C, of course.|pg||
nt|hedyg: he can pick up the J@c|pg||
nt|marlowepi: wow|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@c pushed them|pg||
nt|hedyg: after a long think he might play small @c...|pg||
nt|hedyg: careful keeping the J@C as entry|pg||
nt|hedyg: and when that works he is home|pg||
nt|marlowepi: good moment for a 1H overcall|pg||
nt|hedyg: too late!|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|lc: Could get interesting in that both E and W have to keep @H guards and can be thrown in.|pg||
nt|hedyg: bd 10 3NT in OR, no double|pg||
nt|lc: I;'m guessing the only legit way to beat it was to cash 4@D and then exit (but even then, East might be caught in a major-suit sqz).|pg||
pc|sA|nt|hedyg: now a @H back|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s5|nt|hedyg: doublefinesse in @H? who will switch to @D?|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: again it all goes wrong for no reason|pg||
nt|hedyg: oh!|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but would we not all lead @SK against this bidding?|pg||
nt|lc: Here, West has to keep @HKx and East @HJx -- on a double-dummy basis.  So, then they can be tossed in.|pg||
nt|lc: But, declarer is not playing double-dummy. Just work on @H and hope defense doesn't figure out what to do.|pg||
nt|pelu: they cant take 4 @D-tricks now|pg||
pc|sK|nt|marlowepi: yes, then spade ace and jack|pg||
pc|s7|nt|lc: Not easy when declarer has BID @D -- (albeit a nebulous @D) to correctly figure out how to switch to and run 4@D tricks.|pg||
pc|s9|nt|lc: They can't even do it anyway.|pg||
nt|hedyg: E unlikely to switch to @D with the Q@d as menace in dummy|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry back all,  business tried to interfer |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|hedyg: and best defense again|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but he has also 9 tricks if @cK is on side  |pg||
pc|sT|pc|h2|nt|pelu: he has to discard on the 5.@h and this plan only work with @S kx|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|lc: So, a very practical line of play by Jonsson.|pg||
nt|hedyg: wishing he had passed 2@d|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: TD announces '25 mins'|pg||
nt|pelu: Jansma has min for his X - but all other bidding almost OK - but unlucky|pg||
nt|hedyg: and we are only halfway!|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: TD "sry, 1 hour more"|pg||
nt|hedyg: LOL|pg||

nt|vugraphzgq: most experienced Dutch operators having other things this weekend|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaapfr: this detracking by X of N i think|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the issue is not whether her hand fits the description. the issue is whether that is a good method|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle: snap!|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Jonsson should have passed out 1@H|pg||

mb|p|nt|hedyg: no way!|pg||
pc|c6|nt|roswolf: this wont make|pg||

nt|jaapfr: 5@D logic contract although down here|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3NT was down as well|pg||
nt|hedyg: as was 3@s X|pg||
nt|hedyg: but that was not a penalty double|pg||
nt|hedyg: denied 4@hs, showed minors imo|pg||

nt|hedyg: reallyyyyyyyyy nice to have you here Rob :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 2NT ! is that a dreadful bid?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: but as the Bermuda Bowl will be in the Netherlands we need more operators then, for them practicing too|pg||

pc|hA|nt|jaapfr: 3@C on 3@H|pg||
nt|hedyg: oh|pg||
nt|pelu: better if Fantoni takes @CK also and force pd to play major - block the suit at get the setting trick|pg||
nt|rhelle: Muller had 2 options: 1NT to show @s, and 2@d non-forcing. What is best here?|pg||
nt|hvdhaar: minors :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@s was on|pg||
pc|h8|nt|rhelle: Well given the risk that every suit breaks badly, I think it's very aggressive|pg||
nt|rhelle: especially vul - how happy are you if anyone doubles and it comes back to you?|pg||
nt|hvdhaar: South dbl twice, vulnerable, agressive but not unr.|pg||

mb|2D|nt|jcwla: 4@D seems more helpful.|pg||

nt|ralfwil: hi Marc!|pg||

nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: Is this "don't lead @S"?|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle: 2.5 @h from North|pg||
nt|sybarra: likely leaping to 4 @H here?|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@D= gf 5+ cards|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Jansma made a pass out of turn already and has left the table while Nunes is thinking|pg||

mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: how awful that was|pg||

nt|hedyg: 3NT=|pg||
nt|hedyg: 11 tricks now|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: lol|pg||
nt|hedyg: he was in a hurry  LOL|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|hedyg: i guess you have as many @s stoppers as you bid|pg||
nt|sybarra: this could be messy where ever anyone lands|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@c= 11-15 6+ @cs or 5+@cs and 4 M|pg||
pc|h7|nt|jaapfr: Bob pls tell us later how NS react about the lead ( if any)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: has NO entries to hand outside where pard may have|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 @H likrly the "better hand" |pg||
pc|h5|nt|hedyg: 2@s is either gf or minors|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3NT=?|pg||
nt|hedyg: serious|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Jansma is not back, Nunes passed for him :-)|pg||
nt|hedyg: 5@c was off on a @d lead but impossible for Fantoni to tell|pg||
nt|ralfwil: with open cards he can make, but not sure that he can find|pg||
nt|hedyg: specs correctly saying he can make this but........|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: F asking about lead, answer "asking for count"|pg||
pc|hA|nt|hedyg: now it is both :p|pg||
nt|marlowepi: a lucky 5D here|pg||
nt|hedyg: Muller worried about @hs?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he should be|pg||
nt|marlowepi: esp after the X|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I don't quite see Nunes as a GF he must have his rosy spectacles on|pg||
nt|hedyg: i am told it is an artificial minimum|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: this is how very friendly the atmosphere is over here|pg||
nt|hedyg: 10 is gf opposite 14+|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dK|nt|kiwibridge: is Nunes crying yet Bob :)|pg||
nt|pelu: can he make with @hs 3-3?|pg||
nt|pelu: and @SJ in S - close to 8 tricks|pg||
nt|hedyg: especially with fit|pg||
nt|pelu: remember that 1@S = 14+|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2NT would be 5+ with fit|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: and one more - Jan is back now|pg||
nt|hedyg: interesting that the CC says A from AK|pg||
pc|dA|nt|hedyg: De Wijs could have bid 3@H with force in @H|pg||
nt|rhelle: Is it that lucky? looks like a @d dropping or the @c finesse right|pg||
nt|pelu: need @H lead to defeat 3NT - 4@d+4@s + @cA - |pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|marlowepi: great auction though contract needs luck to make|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: such soft values maybe quite useless|pg||
pc|dT|nt|hedyg: here W has no space to explore so 3NT does not necessarily show great strength in @s|pg||
nt|hedyg: needs less luck now|pg||
nt|rhelle: and with the opening in North (sound openings) that looks pretty likely|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Fantoni seems surprised|pg||
nt|pelu: ruff and play @h|pg||
pc|d4|nt|rhelle: looks well within the 35% or so range you need to bid a vulnerable game|pg||
nt|rhelle: interesting cards ... the low @s indicates on honour|pg||
pc|d9|nt|marlowepi: not sure how the spade lead means less luck. it didnt tell E anything he didnt already know, and meanwhile it compromises his options|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|hedyg: he didnt expect the @s fit|pg||
nt|pelu: and 4@s play easy - 4@h need some hard work|pg||
nt|hedyg: we get to see deep Fantunes at work|pg||
nt|hedyg: sry that is Deep Fantoni|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the more I look the less GF I see |pg||
nt|hedyg: this may take a while|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: some sort of @S raise |pg||
nt|hedyg: he has 10 hcps, fit and good 6 card side suit and if that isnt enough he has a void as well|pg||
nt|sybarra: good enough for me in 2/1 or any other  |pg||
nt|hedyg: how much more do you need?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: exactly... he has a poor @D suit , poor @H suit and a void, but does have @S support|pg||
nt|pelu: would u bid a NF 1NT??????|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: F: "sorry"|pg||
nt|hedyg: (he is always very polite)|pg||
nt|hedyg: i am sure he was planning to show the @s fit next when the 2@H bid came along|pg||
nt|sybarra: No peter I would not bid a non forcing nt |pg||
nt|hedyg: in the mean time Welland found a way to play 3@s on bd 10|pg||
nt|pelu: Dont take that serius - just a joke - I find 2@D a fine bid :):)|pg||
nt|hedyg: sry only 2@ss but -3|pg||
nt|pelu: and IMPs back on the next board (the 4@H on 5-1 fit) here Welland i 3@D making|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: close to play a card now as I see it|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|pelu: if making 180/ 200 in 3@C - so best for S to pass - and hope|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes! 11 tricks|pg||
nt|hedyg: must play @ds 3-3 though|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in contrast to weak 2-suited openings, 2-suited opening 2-bids that show a real opener have a lot of merit. the huge difference is that with the former your chances of declaring ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: are far less (esp if u dont have spades), and thus you give opponents too much info. when you have a real hand, it is partner who ratres to be able to make most use of the shape ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: info|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but W should follow with @dK on @dA|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3-3 he can ruff 1 now|pg||
nt|hedyg: if they are 4-2 he is down anyhow|pg||
nt|hedyg: i mean can ruff a small @d|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: if @DK then she should have played @D6 1st round no?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: or if declarer plays a small and ruffs|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but N has to calculate how expensive it is if @d are K10 to j642|pg||
pc|d6|nt|sybarra: duck it now?  you up for that at table?|pg||
nt|sybarra: apparently he is |pg||
nt|rhelle: and the @sJ shows faith - and also how the suit lies|pg||
pc|d5|nt|marlowepi: moment of truth|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|hedyg: all eyes on W|pg||
pc|d7|nt|kiwibridge: to add injury to insult :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: did he reaally played @H?|pg||
nt|hedyg: worried @cs dont split|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Next match in about 50 minutes: Neth 1 vs Iceland. Open Muller/De Wijs vs Magnússon/Haraldsson, closed Baldursson/Jónsson vs Jansma/Paulissen|pg||

nt|hedyg: A@D and @c again?|pg||
nt|pelu: wrong @h - now in big problem - did he play too fast :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: he was playing vs AJ8x in  W|pg||
nt|ralfwil: no hesitation! play @dK immediately|pg||

mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: we've seen 83 imps traded evenly in 15 boards so not tight bridge but good all the same|pg||

nt|Walddk4: The commentators were fast, that helped|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes our fault, sorry |pg||
nt|pelu: West has by his X sjown extra values, and Muller has a lot of fine controls - so he is close to 6@d|pg||
nt|hedyg: he has also already bid 4@s|pg||
nt|pelu: yes - thats pro and contra - |pg||
nt|hedyg: indeed|pg||
nt|pelu: take a coin|pg||
nt|hedyg: but that 4NT bid does show interest surely|pg||
nt|pelu: @hA is not the best defense|pg||
nt|hedyg: defending vs 4@d could have been fun|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not clear, 10 tricks in spades facing  Axxxxx and three small clubs (if spades 2-1 and maybe if not)|pg||
pc|c8|nt|hvdhaar: painless to 9 tricks now|pg||
nt|hedyg: but Fantoni did not promise anything|pg||

nt|ralfwil: another slam|pg||
mb|1S!|an|10-14 4+ !S, mostly unbalanced|nt|hedyg: no trump promotion by playing 4th @h|pg||
mb|d|mb|2S|mb|3H|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|hvdhaar: 1 N game-forcing relay|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hedy is this one way drury?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|hA|nt|hedyg: i think so|pg||
pc|h3|nt|hvdhaar: Will be hard to guess for De Wijs that East's singleton H is an honor|pg||
nt|hvdhaar: D-lay-out is great for 3NT|pg||
nt|hedyg: Bob are you sure of that result?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Yes, Jansma blaimed me for not being surpised|pg||
pc|h6|nt|hedyg: looked like he 2 more losers no matter what|pg||
nt|pelu: Are u sure Bob that 2@S was making? looks like down 1?|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@H and 1@c|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Last session in about 55 minutes. Open room Schollaardt/Wortel vs Zia/Welland, closed Fantunes vs Verbeek/van Zwol|pg||
nt|hedyg: weird|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@H=@s|pg||
nt|sybarra: must say 3 nt looks easier as long as clubs 4/4|pg||
nt|marlowepi: will be impressive if they get to slam on 2 balanced hands|pg||
nt|hedyg: but then over 2NT he could have bid something else|pg||
nt|hedyg: like 3@d|pg||
nt|ralfwil: in Sweden S has a typical hand for Stenberg 2nt after pass|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|hK|nt|hedyg: i am told they do not play drury|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that is OK facng 4th suit opener as here (esp red), but facing 3rd seat it can turn a plus into a minus|pg||
pc|hT|nt|hedyg: NT is wrongsided too on a @c lead|pg||
pc|h5|nt|hedyg: and the 9@c is an extra entry to the N hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: this lead kills the @H suit|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|hedyg: so 2@c here is 10+ balanced or fit|pg||
pc|sK|nt|hedyg: will have to guess @s|pg||
pc|h9|nt|hvdhaar: Luckily not vulnerable undertricks; west's entry for the hearts is gone|pg||
nt|hedyg: but didnt|pg||
nt|pelu: welland didn't check for the 5-3 fit in @S - just jumped to 3NT (after 1@D - 1@S - 1NT)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|hedyg: 4NT = even nr of keycards|pg||
nt|marlowepi: of course they may haveagreements i dont know aboiut, but with both red aces the choice of 3S seems odd|pg||
nt|hedyg: it seems to be forcing showing the 10+ with fit|pg||
nt|marlowepi: would seem better to start showing the goodies as early as possible|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe 2N was slammish and 3S denied shortness?|pg||
nt|hedyg: no alerts|pg||
nt|marlowepi: then this auction would make a lot of sense|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|hedyg: as long it makes sense to them :)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|hedyg: 5@c cue|pg||
nt|marlowepi: or maybe 4C was serious slam try so S felt 4N was safe|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2NT=18+ 5332 or 6322|pg||
pc|s7|nt|hedyg: 5@s denies any red kings now|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes really it is a perfecto mesh given no shortness|pg||
nt|hedyg: Fantoni might worry about A@s in S and no A@h|pg||
nt|hedyg: i am told 5@c= cue and asking re Q@s|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i dont think so. S couldnt bid so much with no major ace|pg||
pc|d4|nt|hedyg: ?|pg||
nt|hedyg: really ducked?|pg||

nt|hedyg: 4NT showed and even nr of keycards, said nothing re @H|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|marlowepi: are u saying N bid keycard?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|hvdhaar: TRF Lebensohl (Rubensohl)|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2nd time today we have a precision style 2@c with a 5 card major|pg||
nt|hedyg: 5@c means we are missing 1 and half keycards can you cover anything?|pg||
mb|3H|nt|hvdhaar: North will act again|pg||
nt|hedyg: no i am saying they bid turbo|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|hedyg: W could be 5-4 here basically though unlikely with the obvious @H shortage|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@s was passed out in the OR|pg||

nt|hedyg: over 2@H X|pg||
nt|hedyg: so 4NT is nr of keycards, not asking|pg||
nt|marlowepi: right then it is still the case that S would not do that without a heart control i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: wrong all round Xfer not completed and N passes :)|pg||

nt|hedyg: i found 1!|pg||

pc|s4|nt|hedyg: i am not alone :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: pushing e/w right into slam?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i suspect he was trying to buy it at 5H. fearing that 4D would give too much away and help opps in bidding and/or ply|pg||
