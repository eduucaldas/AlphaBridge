mb|2N|an|2NT = ART. AND FORCING|mb|p|nt|flash: in general, the approach on this side of the pond with a 6-4 hand is to rebid the 6-card suit, unless one holds more than a minimum|pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|nt|buffytvs: not a bad slam if they can get South on play --|pg||

mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|nt|lml: we they are committed to the slam now|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|nt|buffytvs: with a stiff club in dummy, and a trump lead unattractive, she may well lead a spade |pg||

nt|lml: I dont think a heart lead is very attractive.  Its possible she might|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: yes we are on the same page|pg||
nt|lml: but then again she could lead anything|pg||

nt|buffytvs: as long as Nick returns a heart right away of course|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sK|pc|s5|pg||
nt|lml: yes he has to find the right ace to cash but then a heart is more likely to go away|pg||
nt|buffytvs: he will guess they're off an ace though, since no-one tried for 7|pg||
nt|lml: so that might be a hint|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: Nick and Judy play 4th best leads so I doubt there is anything in the 2 for suit preference|pg||
nt|lml: the fact that the club shortness encouraged balcome suggests he has some club length|pg||
nt|guppy: Nick has to find @h return....perhaps Judy's spot card perhaps could have been higher ...|pg||

mb|4S|mb|p|nt|buffytvs: or rather 4@S making 5|pg||
mb|p|mb|5H|nt|fabsayc: in precision system, the 1@D opening is ambigous as to length|pg||

mb|5S|mb|p|nt|buffytvs: I like the call though|pg||

mb|p|nt|lml: but its enough now!|pg||
nt|buffytvs: Ross doesn't believe the 5-level belongs to the opponents, obviously|pg||
nt|lml: now they have to guess diamonds|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: Keith will need to find the @DQ, does he play Nick who holds 4 or Judy who opened the bidding?|pg||
nt|buffytvs: as long as the defence ruffs out the @C10|pg||
nt|lml: you can go either way |pg||
pc|cK|pc|c6|pc|c4|nt|fabsayc: we use to play 1@D followed by 2@C showed real clubs, not necissarily diamonds|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|buffytvs: he knows Judy has about 10 cards in the round suits...|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: yes good point|pg||
pc|cA|nt|fabsayc: so there is a need for a way to show primary diamonds, and that is the 2@D opening|pg||

nt|buffytvs: Keith's  a very good declarer -- don't bet against him|pg||

nt|lml: its that Nick has the diamond length clearly|pg||

pc|h7|pc|h6|pc|hK|pc|h5|pg||

pc|h7|pc|hK|nt|fabsayc: however south knew his partner had values, and the only hand that would get shut out by 1D opening would be with clubs|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
