nt|henryb:  Hello All|pg||
nt|henryb:  back to 17|pg||
nt|gracelin: Hi all|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Hi|pg||
nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|gracelin: Hi Roland.  The first match saw one 20:10 . three 17:13 and one 16:14VP.  Hengsha now leads the field by wnning 20 in their first match against China's Ladies team.|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|sybarra: this may be first ones to one nt |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=ART, 9-13 HCP, 4+@H, maybe longer @C/@D/@S|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome to Al Hollander|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: another set with the "fun" systems|pg||
nt|ahollan1: expect a LOT of alerts for NS system   Forcing 1@C, Transfer Openers [aka submarine]|pg||
nt|henryb:  Hello All|pg||
nt|henryb:  A partscore battle, with N-S aboe to make 4@c and E-W 2@s|pg||
nt|tejjyid: And this time, it's also probbaly the battle for 2ndplace as well|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hi all.|pg||
nt|xenya: double?|pg||
mb|d|nt|henryb:  I would expect the auction to start P-P-1@s-some bid showing @h& a minor |pg||
nt|henryb:  wrond again|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=NF, ART, 8-11 HCP, 3@H  [maybe min, 4@H]|pg||
nt|sybarra: al,  are e/w playing precision? |pg||
nt|ahollan1: Shi-Hou are playing Precision -- i was just typing that Shirley :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: for those watching,  this will be a lot of artificial bidding,  |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hi everyone welcome|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: hi|pg||
mb|3C|nt|ahollan1: both pairs at other table also playing Precision variant|pg||
nt|sybarra: only used with experienced partnerships and 400 pages of system notes|pg||
nt|henryb:  The Australian pair clearly do not play strong club|pg||
nt|rodal f: N for the first take out.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Jack, please tell us about these two teams|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think NS plays 1M>2M direct raise 8-10|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: ok maybe only 385 pages|pg||
nt|ahollan1: convention cards -- and some supplementary notes - online under http://www.pabf2010.co.nz/Participants/Convention-Cards/Open.aspx|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi all:)|pg||
nt|brgpro: kebiya=copia, my club|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: and north is the boss, Mr. Jin|pg||
nt|brgpro: my pd is playing with my boss|pg||
nt|gracelin: not a good sign, Jack.|pg||
nt|brgpro: :)|pg||
mb|d|nt|sybarra: might N sit?|pg||
nt|sybarra: or is he bidding  1 nt |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: this seems rather high|pg||
nt|rodal f: Teyssier was cold:)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Hi to the kibitzers!|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: must say I am not a fan of sitting at imps|pg||
nt|jcwla: D/K if this is the dummy N is expecting, but it's not enough.  This is down a couple.|pg||
mb|3S|nt|henryb:  clearly 1N was forcing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Reid's 2@D bid doesn't seem to fit the explanation I gave -- but i got if from their notes |pg||
nt|gracelin: This is the first match of an invitational event of Beijing's 10 bridge clubs. |pg||
nt|Walddk2: While Jack will be watching the Football World Cup I presume :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  hello to all|pg||
nt|brolucius: East's 2@S is non-forcing but suggests around 8-10 points, to distinguish it from a 1@S response on around 0-7.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: If this is a typical hand for mini-splinter, west should be able to stop safely despite his wealth of high cards|pg||
mb|3N|nt|vugraphzkt: good morning all|pg||
nt|peachy: this is not a happy hand to either side|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: Hi all, gm from sunny bangalore in South India|pg||
nt|rodal f: The web page for the turney: http://www.pabf2010.co.nz/|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Good morning|pg||
nt|h_karluk: decent controls|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3@D was somewhat forward on those values, but South would no doubt have opened 1@D on a doubleton and wanted to tell North that she could compete with a diamond fit.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This could be a Precision 13-15 NT, but we don't have the CCs|pg||
nt|xenya: 4@C -- 4@S -- no|pg||
nt|Walddk2: ´ó¼ÒºÃ  to our Chinese viewers|pg||
nt|wygbe1: interesting choice by w|pg||
nt|xenya: 3N must have some special meaning|pg||
mb|4S|nt|rv: Hi Rodal|pg||
nt|gracelin: the 10 teams will play a 16-bds round robin to decide winners.  Cash prizes for all teams plus for wnners of every match. |pg||
nt|brgpro: all other team members are in beijing|pg||
nt|gracelin: and NBA final about 3 hours ago.|pg||
nt|brgpro: i prefer to stay at home...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Sun Ming is a one of the top woman players in China |pg||
nt|wygbe1: i would probably just bid a mundane 4s|pg||
mb|d|nt|janm: EW will probably end in 4@s on this one, and should make it unless NS get 2 club ruffs - I guess 5@c is actually better, let's see if West will show his club support to get there|pg||
nt|janm: This auction might get them to 3NT, which would not be a success|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the Open Room starts play with board  29 -- so they will see results from us|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure who do bet on here,  defense if @H start I think|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and potentially valuable @dK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The club position is interesting with J10 doubleton|pg||
nt|peachy: Your guess is probably right, Precision popular in China|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think he has a chance of making this|pg||
mb|r|nt|henryb:  the two-step probably shows constructive values|pg||
nt|gracelin: EW in both rooms reached the inferior 4-3 fit rather than the 5-3 D fit.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mwigor: hi all|pg||
nt|barnets: looks like a save v 5@H|pg||
nt|wygbe1: looks beatable if n could just tap w in h, but the miracle diamond position prevents that|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: we can only peek at their [and any other vugraph table] using http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/ |pg||
nt|gracelin: the two teams playing here are the host Xinyuan and their sister club Sanchen Cartoon|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  We do not have an auction, but at the other table West over reached to 4@s and caught a vey bad dummy|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Hyper-agressive bidding by the NZ  north-south in the other room propelled the auction very high, very quick|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 6@d in the 4-3 fit looks OK to me|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 6NT you can make with the right guesses as well|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: big think by Tony|pg||
nt|brgpro: N is the famous chinese lady player, S used to be the coach of the chinese junior's team|pg||
nt|brgpro: EW are fairly young players|pg||
nt|brgpro: maybe not that young...born in the 70's|pg||
nt|brolucius: What 'fairly young' means depends on your own age.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: East should not drive to slam as passed hand, lack of key card situation|pg||
nt|brolucius: 8-10 opposite 14 does not really place them in the slam range.|pg||
pc|h5|nt|janm: Perhaps if W bid 3@c here, E might retreat to 5@c, but West decided his suit was good enough to play in, and with the @h A lead, he'll be right, I think|pg||
nt|pelu: Hi all|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: this match is 1st China-Taipei vs 5th Japan|pg||
nt|h_karluk: it would be a fall from grace, routine +450|pg||
pc|hA|nt|Walddk2: Win dummy and play a club, or win in hand and lead a spade to the king|pg||
pc|h8|nt|tejjyid: The auction looks a bit murky, Nunn calrifies it for us|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now a club and his worries will soon be over|pg||
nt|peachy: i have a strange blink on screen, brb|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: ..and in the end they got the outcome they wanted (opps made the last mistake!)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: a passive @S lead & East will be very happy|pg||
pc|d8|nt|tejjyid: Thanks for coming...|pg||
pc|d2|nt|wygbe1: on k of h lead, w must play diamonds before leading a spade - if does not, s can win, put n in with club, and allow n to tap w with h|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|peachy: declarer of course does not know that pretty much anything will work|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|barnets: @DK|pg||
nt|brgpro: this tournament is basically for the payers living in Beijing area|pg||
nt|brolucius: How popular is bridge in China nowadays, Jack?|pg||
nt|brgpro: depends on places. very popular in beijing, shanghai...and several provinces|pg||
nt|brolucius: Some say it is declining in other countries but the USA has recently had a modest increase in registered players.|pg||
pc|d6|nt|frankaus: g'day all|pg||
nt|gracelin: both pairs of Xinyuan team play Precision.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hi all.|pg||
nt|gracelin: Hi Jordan|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Zhu has all the good diamonds after the ace is knocked out but he has no entries|pg||
pc|d4|nt|barnets: may have worked|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ahollan1: likely 300 for NS -- i'd feel good bringing that score back to the table|pg||
nt|barnets: as if east had rufffed with the 9 dec would crash the spade honours|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Looks like he gave up|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|henryb:  Nasty breaks on this hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is the 1st of 12 matches for Round Robin  2 -- results aren't posted yet from RR1, but the rotation for RR2 is based upon final tally|pg||
pc|dK|nt|pelu: 1nt had been a nice contract - but prob forcing - but even then I would have passed in S (pd is a passed hand)|pg||
nt|gracelin: north did not expect south has 4-card spade support|pg||
pc|c3|nt|henryb:  I do not know why East wanted a club; a heart would have been more useful|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: results site is http://www.nzbridgecongress.co.nz/pabf2010/|pg||
nt|tejjyid: not much fun discarding from the N hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This was a zero line. Are we sure that he won @HA?|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ahollan1: the Juniors are playing this in 4@CN|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Frank|pg||
nt|frankaus: part score battles are worth a suprising number of imps|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: Sorry was away from table :(  Will record a claim shortly|pg||
nt|frankaus: 6-8 for a double part score swing mounts up real quick|pg||
nt|brgpro: different case in china. membership is not important for many players|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Seems so|pg||
pc|dA|pc|c4|nt|brgpro: -2 become -1|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ahollan1: 13th @H might have worked well there|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|henryb:  this will drift down one, but slowly. As I have observed before, no one ever goed dowd wuickly|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|gracelin: another D and ruffing by north will return to -2|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jcwla: The OR is starting with 29 and 30 so we'll feed them comparisons when they circle back to 17.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: sorry fast play i may have missed something here|pg||
nt|brgpro: dont think they will find it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What, no Li, Wang or Chang at this table?? :)  Not in the other room either for that matter|pg||
pc|s3|pc|c9|pg||
nt|janm: NS have a heart, a spade and a club and EW have 5 or 6 spades (depending whether N's spade trick is taken by a ruff or not), 3 diamonds and at least 2 clubs|pg||
pc|s4|nt|kiwi_joker: dummy's diamonds an alluring target - but unreachable|pg||
pc|s2|nt|pelu: Yes 1Nt was F1 - but from a passsed hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so Reid could ditch his 2nd @S|pg||
nt|sybarra: I suspect their bidding was slightly different|pg||
nt|pelu: Hi all - my name is Peter Lund (Denmark) and I will try to help u in this round|pg||
pc|s8|nt|Walddk2: Cheng simply did not believe that he could be this lucky in clubs|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I think there was a better line, after the @S pitch Noth's hand can be striped and you can play @H for a guaranteeed 2 tricks|pg||
nt|tejjyid: but it wasn't necessary|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Oh, we have a Wang here|pg||
pc|cK|nt|gracelin: a 2nd chance to pla D, and south did.  Now it's up to north to ruff partner's winner|pg||
nt|peachy: or diamonds|pg||
pc|c7|nt|henryb:  One thing I observe generally: if declarer takes a long time he is obeying Hammans second rule: If you don't play a card you can't go down|pg||
nt|ahollan1: only every bid|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The most common surname in China we were told earlier|pg||
nt|wygbe1: well don by declarer|pg||
pc|h3|nt|gracelin: north didn't|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
mc|10|nt|h_karluk: so far neither of them succumbed|pg||

nt|ahollan1: i should say if you RESPOND to 1@H|pg||
nt|geot: I@S, but really stuch if pd bids 2@D|pg||
nt|geot: stuck|pg||
nt|geot: I will pass 2@D in that case|pg||
nt|geot: But I would pass 1@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hehe    i was typing   "easiest to PASS"|pg||
nt|geot: yes:)....but if you bid on hands similar to this, I think bidding the major is the best. Might work even if partner bid 4@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but make @C2  @CK then it really is a problem|pg||
nt|fabog:  hi all|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hi all welcome aboard|pg||
nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|sundiszno: this is a practice match|pg||
nt|sundiszno: from Budapest, Hungary|pg||
nt|vugraphzmz: hi everyone|pg||
nt|sundiszno: the hungarian national team practices for oostende, and getting a challenger|pg||
nt|fabog:  Hittmann - Szonyi plays a special strong club relay system|pg||
nt|vugraphzmz: hey all (:|pg||
mb|1H|nt|xenya: hello Brigitta|pg||
nt|sundiszno: in fact, operator have been interchanged, so we have Daniel here|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: Daniel then|pg||
nt|sundiszno: and Arpad plays tzhe same system with them, so he is a specialist of EW-'s bidding system|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|mb|3C|nt|xenya: why was E's pass alerted?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sundiszno: fabog, your answer, pls :)|pg||
nt|fabog:  Can be strong balanced, W has to reopen with double with 1.5+ defensive tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: oh i see, thanks|pg||
mb|p|nt|sundiszno: NS playing precision, weak NT|pg||
nt|sundiszno: there is some money at stake, if the national team wins, they take it, if Gamax wins, they donate it to or junior team |pg||
nt|vugraphzmz: lead is 3rd/5th if there's at least a jack, if otherwise highest|pg||
mb|d|nt|h_karluk: Geza strong player, also served 10 years (92-02) WBF MBSZ Executive Committee |pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: in 2003 was WBF Organizing Committee member |pg||
nt|sundiszno: in the open, NS is in 5@h doubled|pg||
nt|henryb:  Hello all|pg||
mb|3S|nt|andreasw:  good sacrefise if u guess everything right in 4@s|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|ahollan1: Asbi-Tobing play Cappelletti over 1@H-(DBL)    i have to admit, i don't remember what that means other than 2@C was NOT available as natural non-force|pg||
nt|geot: South tried 2@C at the other table, probably NF :).... but then North went to 4@H, naturally|pg||
nt|ritong: hi chaps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: bon jour Henri|pg||
nt|geot: Hi Henri|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: Gabor WINKLER is a World International Master|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  4@s will make with good peaking shoes|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Wu didn't really PASS|pg||
pc|h5|nt|geot: no|pg||
nt|xenya: with @CJ well placed and no ruff, 8 tricks should be easy |pg||
pc|hA|nt|h_karluk: I think Truscott is a nice defense to strong club and relay system|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h3|pg||

pc|d4|pc|dQ|pc|c3|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ahollan1: even then -- Patrick took 2 more bids than mere mortals would on East hand|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c6|pc|d5|pg||
pc|dA|pc|c5|nt|h_karluk: and we introduced Peter and Csaba previous session|pg||
nt|andreasw:  how did 5@h go 3?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: even doubled|pg||
nt|sundiszno: several @s leads from west makes @hJ a trick|pg||
nt|andreasw:  :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  defense took @sAK, then uppercut the @hJ|pg||

nt|frankaus: just 3 here|pg||
nt|sybarra: -1 not the end of the world here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: missed opportunity, but any plus may be good on that board|pg||
nt|barnets: would hav been a nice try|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi RV:) And welcome. Long time ago.|pg||
nt|rodal f: A easy 3NT?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: not sure abt made +1 , defenders likely cashed a @s+ a @c and 2 @d|pg||
nt|gracelin: don't follow the play.  Hou should not ruff the Heart.  He could get in later to draw trump|pg||
nt|h_karluk: if doesnt ruff then decl makes loser in loser|pg||
nt|brgpro: there are very active players who are not members of the bridge league here|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer made some move towards establishing the heart suit in case he could not ruff both losing clubs.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: strong or medium notrump Jack?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@H=11-15 HCP, a) 5+@H  b) 4441@D |pg||
nt|jcwla: no 2 @D's -- two went on @C KJ and one on @HJ|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: this tourney is played in double round robin format with no subsequent play-offs|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: feel free anyone to commentate|pg||
nt|gracelin: This shud be an easy 4S for NS, even if East can get his Heart ruff, there's only 3 tricks for defense|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @hJ master forces to ruff or pitch stiff @c at th table|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but table had 4 dias and decl had only 2 club winner|pg||
nt|gracelin: on previous one south shud not ruff either HK or HJ, just wait to get in to draw trump|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think +1 impossible|pg||
mb|1D|nt|sybarra: can W stay in his seat |pg||
nt|sybarra: yes seems so |pg||
nt|sybarra: "stay in his seat" as in pass|pg||
nt|brgpro: easy 4@h or 3NT...|pg||
nt|gracelin: 3NT is the coldest game contract for NS, but of course, 4H also makes here.|pg||
nt|peachy: this hand might be easy to overbid, but likely they settle in 3NT|pg||
mb|1N|nt|henryb:  6@h is a reasonable contract, needing 2-2 hearts or stiff queen|pg||
nt|henryb:  and no club ruff on lead|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Miller-Stout play precision.|pg||
nt|tejjyid: It's irrational, but I bet Nunn & Hans feel a warm fuzzy feeling inside after the good start|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  Precision remains pupolar|pg||
nt|h_karluk: allright club-system|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: wow  last hand Chinese Taipei Juniors 4@C made 5 |pg||
nt|brgpro: 14-16 is popular here but S is an old fashioned player, so i guess 13-15|pg||
nt|xenya: the redouble looks quite reasonable here -- unless E has only 3 spades, 4@S is unlikely to go down more than 1, but declarer rates to earn much more |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: interesting choices for Shi over 2@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N, trap pass, 3@C [@H raise], 2@D all seem to have merit|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe tryingn to get the @D suit in before the ht raise |pg||
nt|henryb:  with various conventions of their own, such as this 3@d bid to show a gf raise|pg||
nt|gracelin: so Sanchen beat 4S in the closed room to get the first blood.  But I really don't believe south (Hou) ruff HK and play CA and another club to allow 4S be made|pg||
nt|gracelin: I know Hou very well. He never made such mistakes.|pg||
nt|jcwla: BTW...any comment on @HQ from N?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 9 cards fit, don't get the idea why 3N preferred|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  *popular, sorry|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: green V red usually a go signal :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes thought he might come in  but suit is a bit tacky |pg||
nt|sybarra: my guess is we are in game force sequence here|pg||
nt|h_karluk: marked, isn't it?|pg||
nt|gracelin: thanks to south's doubleton club|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  hello to all|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hi Sveta|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ty ty fellows|pg||
mb|2C|nt|ahollan1: and protecting against opener having the 4441@D hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: Hou pulled out the 4 @s card then changed his mind|pg||
nt|tejjyid: BTW, anyone who wants to jump in and advise me I'm an idiot, do feel free|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: thinking|pg||
nt|jcwla: N's negative double showed the minors.  Now you see the problems with 2@S:|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hi Sveta|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Sveta|pg||
nt|gracelin: because 9 fast tricks, Hamdi.|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: One, it gives the opponents two levels of room; two,|pg||
nt|gracelin: just tried to catch declarer's unprepared and played HJ on that trick. |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Curiously, Wang and Cheng are the two most common surnames in China. I think Patrick told us yesterday that there are more than 100 million Wang's in China|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwi_joker: Not sure about 4@H, as Miller still apparently had the K@S to cue|pg||
nt|henryb:  3N is probably a "serious slam try, while minor suit cues would be "courtesy"|pg||
nt|rv: yes cold, @h8 ensures a stopper and only 4-0 @d break offside can trouble this contract|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I'll feel like I'm back at the bridge table|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: the more the merrier|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: i expect this will fail|pg||
nt|janm: Looks as if NS can make about 3 hearts (maybe 4) and EW can make about 3 clubs.|pg||
nt|barnets: n/s have an easy partscore in clubs|pg||
nt|pelu: Basis system: NS: Precision @c and EW: 5 card major with weak and strong NT (green-red)|pg||
nt|jcwla: it now gives E something to think about when a huge chunk of the strength of E's hand is a @S void that's of no use in defense to 4@SX.|pg||
nt|brgpro: NS can make 4@C as the cards |pg||
pc|h2|nt|sybarra: needs the spade lead,   should be -1 |pg||
nt|janm: Let's see if EW can get the spade ruff to beat this. If W leads a high club, E can overtake to lead a spade back|pg||
nt|janm: But on the trump lead I think NS are going to make 4 hearts|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@D is a mystery|pg||
nt|gracelin: Hi Sveta|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Jack, they can't do without you!|pg||
nt|xenya: in the other room, N just bid 3N|pg||
nt|h_karluk: suitable for frequency|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|tejjyid: what a nice system - pay in 8 card @D fit at 2 level |pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: no warm fuzzy things running around the table (yet)|pg||
nt|gracelin: by opening 3D EW missed a decent sacrifice here, 5D doubled is only -2|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think that very soft 2@h weak underlined many things, just helped declarer|pg||
pc|h7|nt|henryb:  I recently saw a study suggesting that with 4-3-3-3 opposite 4-4-3-2  you should not try for the 4-4 major suit fit|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Other room just started to bid Bd 18|pg||
nt|henryb:  Oh? I thought they went back to play 29 and 30|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|frankaus: has a chance but its really tough|pg||
nt|rodal f: Safe for a try by 10 tricks now.|pg||
nt|brgpro: u see, fu is playing with the boss...|pg||
nt|gracelin: lucky to find partner with DA instead of KQ|pg||
nt|wygbe1: yes the imp scoring rewards rdbls where contract is down one at worst|pg||
pc|c3|nt|rv: now 10 tricks possibly|pg||
pc|c9|nt|sybarra: would have to magically read the club suit I think |pg||
nt|janm: So we've had two hands in a row where the best defence would be to take ruffs.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure if i would have been any better off with 3N|pg||
nt|sybarra: well it both sounds like they have an ace the DO NOT have |pg||
nt|barnets: i think south should x and north bid 3@C|pg||
nt|pelu: very nice contract if @Hs was running - or even 4-1|pg||
nt|jcwla: Yeah it's sort of surprising at these colors that nobody took further action.|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|sybarra: (imho)|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: E figures to be short so playing 9@S there would have been a decent shot|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Nobuyuki Hayashi|pg||
nt|tejjyid: probably a bit early for the warm fuzzy things|pg||
nt|jcwla: E has made the trusting decision and will be rewarded.  @H's E/W have three losers off the top.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They might go for 6@D now|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|frankaus: now @C was req|pg||
nt|pelu: I see the point - but how do u know that ps has 4-4-3-2 :)?|pg||
nt|henryb:  I am however convinced that it is losing bridge in general to bid game with two balanced hands and 24 HCP|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Wang Zhi-ge|pg||
nt|tejjyid: they like to sleep in|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: :)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: Reid checks to see if 2 tricks is enough to beat 6@H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not a great slam by any means and it will no doubt fail here|pg||
pc|d9|nt|sybarra: might he be concerned spade is cashing?|pg||
nt|npcjpn: Hello from Hamilton.|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|sybarra: @H lead is bad idea now however |pg||
nt|peachy: it will be a hard one to make, impossible to make without seeing all ard, if even then|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't even think *I* would want to bid it|pg||
nt|peachy: :)|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d4|nt|sybarra: Reid might have also been checking backs of cards to see if they match |pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: N and E starting taking the bidding cards away before Reid had a chance to X|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm told neither NS player is known for being pessimisstic -- @SA not cashing would be way beyond that description|pg||
nt|gracelin: West may underlead his CA to lose it|pg||
nt|h_karluk: say played a @s, still retains trump control|pg||
nt|h_karluk: defenders cannot cash more than @cA|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and i dont think decl careless enough to begin with @hQ|pg||
nt|gracelin: West may lose his CA if he tries the underlead.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: for now seems best defense there is to play @dJ|pg||
nt|h_karluk: in that case decl has to ruff and tackle hearts|pg||
nt|xenya: this is a quiet one, declarer losing 1 club, 2 diamonds and 2 spades  |pg||
pc|dK|nt|janm: Of course S doesn't know for certain that the spade A is onside |pg||
nt|pzpp: E-W here just bid to an unlucky game in NT, with almost every card placed badly for them|pg||
nt|peachy: for those who don't know, a slam that shouldn't be bid, is named after him "a Roland slam"|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Let's assume that declarer guesses diamonds by cashing the king first, then finessing the 8. That is still not enough as he has to lose a club and a spade|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|rodal f: ? 9 u have. By the @Shook u still have 9 if it loose.|pg||
nt|rv: Check this url http://www.nzbridgecongress.co.nz/pabf2010/Openxtab.html for all the latest standings|pg||
nt|pelu: now 8 - but "no way" to the 9. trick|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c6|nt|pelu: best play @D and try yo set up a squeeze against West|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|pelu: Yes he dont want S in - but if he still not 9 tricks even with @SK right|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|janm: My typing is slower than the players' play! So on to the next hand|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hi welcome Nobuyuki, you too Roland, good luck with your move to the UK|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: anything but @Sx works  --  but i would have thought @SA and go to next hand|pg||
nt|npcjpn: Both Ino and Teramoto are bridge professional in Japan.|pg||
pc|h6|nt|pelu: wd|pg||
nt|h_karluk: as @c A outside still cannot cash @sQ|pg||
nt|gracelin: still 11 tricks for a push|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So altogether, a very poor slam|pg||
nt|peachy: this ace lead might help him guess trump, but as you said, still not enough'|pg||
pc|hA|nt|pelu: pressure on N|pg||
nt|henryb:  it would be nice to stop in 1NT,  -- oh oh, North just gave the contract|pg||
nt|pelu: and N just discard the wrong card: @s2|pg||
nt|xenya: now 1 diamond less|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|pelu: for sure not @h9|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: thinking|pg||
nt|pelu: sorry - East can stop the @ss - :(:(:( - I will go for coffee :)|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed -- or with anything at all for that matter|pg||
nt|gracelin: Jack, I am sure Fu will raise you to 4H if you were sitting north :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: sure Patrick, however you know defenders lead advantage, i don't know how on earth North dictated that 3N while 2 times passed p there|pg||
nt|h_karluk: unless overreach 3@h|pg||
nt|brgpro: declarer can eliminate @h and @s then duck a @d|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c8|nt|pelu: now the squeeze work|pg||
pc|d5|nt|pzpp: now, taking the wrong view in @c finesse, just lose another trick|pg||

nt|h_karluk: =  Extreme 2-suiter, I don't think they ever pass weak hands when nonvul.|pg||
mb|1D|nt|sundiszno: EW playing a home-grown strong club-based relay system, fabog is the expert of that|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Chinese Taipei can lock up the win if they just lose by less than 39 imps|pg||
nt|geot: West in the CR also overcalled 2@H over a 1 spade opener, and ended up playing ag 4@Sx|pg||
nt|xenya: N is not strong enough to use stayman here, so he passes, and 4-4 spade is missed -- but 1N is a solid contract|pg||

nt|rnmalik: Hello all and welcome.|pg||
nt|gracelin: suth will pen a Precision 1C, I guess|pg||
nt|gracelin: open|pg||
nt|gracelin: north might have a way to show his 3-suiter in a positive hand.|pg||
nt|brgpro: we play different style of X then suit...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, he had 8 certain tricks in his own hand and gambled on one with partner|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I have seen worse gambles|pg||
nt|h_karluk: got it now|pg||
nt|brolucius: I was wondering if a diamond though from West would break that. Defenders can exit with a third heart, can't they?|pg||
nt|brgpro: he can later ruff out the @h then play @sK @s9 discard a @d from hand|pg||
mb|1N|nt|janm: I confess I'd also open 2@s with the S hand - everything is right - vulnerability, position, spades being the highest suit|pg||
nt|npcjpn: Ino won the senior teams in Bejing.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Nice to have RV here. All info comes:) Local time here is 0530 but free today:)|pg||
mb|d|nt|janm: Of course now that 2@s has been alerted, it probably showed 5 spades and a 4 or 5 card minor, so wasn't even wrong on suit length, but I think it would be right to open it even if ...|pg||
nt|janm: it was just a weak 2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: same 1@H explanation as last board|pg||
nt|npcjpn: This year, he plays in open.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Great result there for Indonesia.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 3N -srry for typo|pg||
nt|brgpro: W has to give a ruff-sluff|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: a heavy 2N|pg||
nt|barnets: with 22 hcp and good 5 card suit|pg||
nt|barnets: n./s would be s well to bid 7N as 6 |pg||
nt|barnets: 13  tricks without club lead|pg||
nt|h_karluk: likely 2N for NS, however who knows|pg||
mb|2D|nt|sybarra: ok now can e/w find and make slam? |pg||
nt|ahollan1: notes say Newell has 6@S --- i believe the notes|pg||

mb|p|nt|barnets: east is marginal for a 4N raise|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Cards are nicely placed for NT.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: 2 @C looks like "single suited"  |pg||
nt|sybarra: my guess is W can tell which suit |pg||
nt|frankaus: sys on  here is normal these days with X replacing 21C|pg||
nt|janm: N probably has a good idea that his partner's second suit is clubs and so won't be useful, but it's certainly possible to envision game anyway.|pg||
nt|pelu: 3NT on @dQ|pg||
nt|henryb:  2N clearly a @s raise|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i meant 1@h artificial|pg||
nt|wygbe1: not sure what west has to think about|pg||
nt|wygbe1: if n can reopen with x, would strike gold|pg||
nt|wygbe1: should x by n be pen or takeout?|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, if double is takeout for them|pg||
nt|xenya: judging by the bidding, 1N is 12/14(15), not 14/16|pg||
nt|wygbe1: must be pen, or i assume n would have doubled a while ago - pretty easy takeout x|pg||
nt|xenya: yes|pg||
nt|wygbe1: right sounds like weak nt auction|pg||

nt|h_karluk: that shld b xfer|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: hard to believe both red suits behaving favorably -- and will probably misguess both Qs anyway|pg||
nt|brgpro: anytime W switch to a @d wont help, declarer can throw him in with a @s|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: olmost certainly its @H now that S trans to @S|pg||
nt|sybarra: and wrong colors to be stepping in with 3 @D |pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry with 3 @C I meant|pg||
nt|brgpro: discard a @d from hand, a ruff-sluff always comes|pg||

nt|h_karluk: *one of|pg||
nt|wygbe1: wow|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: I don't know what options he had to invite over the DBL (surely 3@s was not invitational). I think S is going to come to 10 tricks, and he'd probably have accepted most ...|pg||
nt|janm: invitations, with maximum values and good spots in both suits|pg||

nt|vugraphzkt: yes|pg||
nt|jcwla: The stakes are raised here, though not into game.|pg||

pc|c8|nt|frankaus: looks to be a playable spot |pg||
nt|friggi: sure it does|pg||

nt|rv: my apologies for the delay, signing in from sunny Bangalore in South India|pg||
nt|barnets: i thnk north will lead a @H|pg||
nt|rv: after 6@d, can North consider an attacking lead?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: not much to the play here worst he can lose 3@S 1@D|pg||
nt|pzpp: yes, and the lead helps declarer ahead in the race for tricks|pg||
mc|6|nt|pelu: same strat as the bidding in Board 1|pg||

nt|henryb:  3@c is a non-standard rebid -- and since I do not have the CC handy, I cannot tell you what it shows|pg||
nt|brgpro: 2@d is not transfer, but GF stayman|pg||
nt|h_karluk: another 12-14 NT|pg||

nt|geot: Wu reasonably did not want to defend the redoubled contract. Will Huang bid 2@D now, suggesting red suits? Or 2@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: one options = weak 1-suiter pulls the double immediately [via some mechanism]|pg||

nt|sundiszno: they are off a keycard and the trump Q|pg||

nt|henryb:  I do not, but it is playable in a sound opening bid structure|pg||
nt|npcjpn: But some player believes not claiming in order to see defensive methods.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: first slam of the match|pg||
nt|tejjyid: played to make partner feel better about missing game|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: As I said, you go down in a makeable contract if East sarts with only one club.|pg||
nt|brgpro: 10 teams are in the field and everyone will have a prize at the end|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so far not much difficult hands|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 1 IMPs|pg||
nt|brgpro: finally we see a grand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, probably 3@D NV and 3NT V at IMPs|pg||
mb|1C|an| |nt|friggi: ye sbut regardless, why give it away without fightingÐ|pg||
nt|friggi: ?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 2nd one, 1st missed, played 3N|pg||
nt|brolucius: Should be easy, once South shows his heart suit.|pg||
nt|marcsmith: indeed|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: this looks precision-ish |pg||
nt|frankaus: 3NT is likely here|pg||
nt|cascade: does this meet your standard for 2NT Jan?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: does not meet my standard, but i might do it anyway|pg||
nt|brgpro: an easy one i must say|pg||
mb|1S|nt|friggi: sure it is|pg||
nt|janm: I probably wouldn't do it vul, but it's certainly close - I can't imagine bidding anything except 2NT or P|pg||
nt|cascade: 3@c will be invitational with hearts|pg||
nt|janm: Presumably 3@c shows some sort of heart raise|pg||
nt|cascade: and Miller finds himself with a surprisingly good hand for all of the bidding so far|pg||
nt|janm: Everyone has different approaches to Unusual, but as far as I know everyone plays that the cue bids show partner's suit and the 4th suit (although some of us use one and some the ...|pg||
nt|janm: other for those meanings)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=ART, STR, F1, (good 13)14+ HCP unbal, 15+ HCP BAL|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: may be too hard to find|pg||
nt|rv: French Polynesia is doing a lot better than New Caledonia in this tourney|pg||
nt|h_karluk: were 27 hcp and no game|pg||
nt|gracelin: But on the other hand, 4 round of D may subject East to some discard problem|pg||
mb|p|nt|cascade: yes there are various ways|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not sure about 4@C|pg||
nt|janm: Yes, especially with partner bidding 2NT vulnerable, Miller must wonder if his side has a game|pg||
nt|cascade: 3@c tied to hearts and 3@d tied to spades|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: a transfer over the transfer|pg||
nt|npcjpn: looks like Michaels.|pg||
nt|brgpro: esp. after a big @c|pg||
nt|h_karluk: oh sorry i think it was 6 red, previous round|pg||
mb|4N|nt|sybarra: and it is precision  (just not sure which variety) |pg||
nt|frankaus: communications wont be easy |pg||
nt|cascade: personally i play the lower cue agrees partner's suit and the higher is the other suit|pg||
nt|janm: As it is, it's pretty unlucky that 4@c goes down|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=FG, 8+ HCP, 5+@D|pg||
nt|npcjpn: dbl = 3-card support?|pg||
nt|henryb:  the black kings are well placed foe N-S|pg||
nt|pelu: 1@H = @s - and 7+|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3@H/@S available for EW.|pg||
nt|tejjyid: a vey SOUND 2@H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think we can now determine that both pairs play Precision|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: Nt for NS = 12-15|pg||
mb|5D|nt|friggi: but np for 3NT|pg||
nt|fabsayc: that is not why i am not sure|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry wrong cc|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=FG, 10+ HCP, 3+ CNTRL [A=2, K=1], 1-suit, 6+@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H RELAY|pg||
nt|barnets: n/s have good save in 5@C|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 2nd suit or repeating the transfer?|pg||
nt|npcjpn: i bet second suit.|pg||
nt|jcwla: 3@H is preemptive.  2@C is truly moth-eaten on a quacky min and a 5-bagger.|pg||
nt|peachy: echo :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 3@H=7@D 0@C 33  [or (23)80, 2290]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just what Newell wanted to hear :(|pg||
nt|rodal f: Are those 15HP wourth 1NT?  Ok. I use to do the same:)|pg||
nt|gracelin: whether the south hand worth a Vul. 2-level overcall has been argued for years.|pg||
nt|brolucius: North must discover that South does not hold @Sx-x-x.|pg||
nt|marcsmith: i think East should bid 2H over the double|pg||
nt|xenya: strong club for both pairs|pg||
mb|5S|nt|friggi: transfer|pg||
nt|sybarra: the good news is E (or W) will have to lead something |pg||
nt|friggi: thne 3H then 3NT|pg||
nt|friggi: dbl tr|pg||
nt|frankaus: first 9 is on top then it gets difficult|pg||
nt|friggi: 3NT is cold|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it might get you way too high and also misdirect the lead|pg||
nt|henryb:  I do not agree with 3N: I think that should show tricks, and 2N should show 18-19 balanced|pg||
nt|henryb:  that assumes you open 1N with all balanced 15-17|pg||
nt|pelu: 1NT here is 6-10, so Why bid 2NT?|pg||
nt|henryb:  this is the only lead to beat 6N|pg||
nt|pelu: No they play 11-14 NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Newell has extra King for his 1st seat 1@C -- but can't imagine anything other than 3N now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N is discouraging, but since Reid unlimited it is not pure signoff|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Liu still has chance to splinter|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: EW have ended in 5@H on  18|pg||
nt|rv: FP is lying 8th and NC is lying 13th out of 13 teams with 3/4th of tourney over|pg||
nt|pelu: 6@s easy slam to make|pg||
nt|fabsayc: good afternoon from partly cloudy vancouver|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and there were 7NT as far as i remember|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That might show four in their methods|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: nice of @D's to break |pg||
nt|barnets: but never bid|pg||
nt|barnets: only -200|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3@S0single and force til min 4@H|pg||
nt|rv: I might have opened 1@d and rebid 1n with north hand|pg||
nt|gracelin: Good decision to pass.  South may regret his overcall.|pg||
nt|gracelin: winners of every match get a prize of about US$150.  |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Can 2@C be 5-4 either way, Patrick?|pg||
nt|marcsmith: i wonder if West had a pre-emptive 3D available over 1D|pg||
nt|wygbe1: the x must have been made a while ago, just not registered - at least, not on my comp|pg||
mb|p|nt|cascade: Jan tells me she plays the cues the exact opposite way to me|pg||
nt|cascade: the most important thing is that you have an agreement with your partner|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think 3c for hearts, 3d for spades is the most common|pg||
nt|janm: This time we have a game where the declaring side will need ruffs (diamonds) to make it, I think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S asks controls   A=2 K=1|pg||
nt|rv: North could have chanced 3@c with enough distribution though suit is not good at these colors|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: slam chances looking rather slim|pg||
nt|npcjpn: yes, that's I am afraid of.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: he's done it|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Chung now has a Powerhouse|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 1d opening won't appeal to everyone holding west's cards but it will be a popular choice in many sys card there|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: twin 50's on 18 to Japan for 3 imps|pg||
nt|npcjpn: 4@s, just splinter? or exclusion RKCB?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I hate the pass of 2NT here|pg||
nt|brgpro: 13 top tricks in NT, 14 or 15 in @H|pg||
nt|marcsmith: poor method if it does then -- presume they are not playing support doubles|pg||
nt|marcsmith: 5D is not a wild punt|pg||
nt|Walddk2: There is only one thing wrong with 5@D; it can't make. 3NT however ....|pg||
pc|h2|nt|cascade: and the defense have ruffs to beat it |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N=3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so the hand with void gets to declare?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: contemplating 5@C opposite @SK and @HA?|pg||
nt|barnets: he also may have tried 3@C over 2@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: 2@h alerted|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: laughing :)|pg||
nt|marcsmith: indeed, 3N has 9 top tricks with diamonds breaking|pg||
pc|hT|nt|janm: Although if he takes the club finesse he's been offered (right you are that the club bid got them off to the wrong lead), he can pitch the diamond losers and then just needs to ...|pg||
nt|janm: avoid a spade ruff (or S needs to figure things out and give his partner one, which may be hard)|pg||
nt|janm: So that will be a third hand that could have been defeated by a defensive ruff |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: if so then pass =3|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 9 for @H switch, is it?|pg||
nt|gracelin: trump shift now|pg||
nt|jcwla: Sad to see W rewarded for that opener.|pg||
nt|gracelin: They are all Precisioners.|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, that's the way I play.  But I know people put emphasis on club and obnly promises 5-card C|pg||
pc|h9|nt|frankaus: a not so obvious @D lead/switch can couse lots of communications problems|pg||
nt|sybarra: club lead gets a bit messy |pg||
nt|rv: West opening is post-modern, I like his raise to 2@s with 3 card fit instead of 2@d|pg||
nt|pelu: Wellcome to Martin Johnson from Canada|pg||
nt|gracelin: six tricks seem to be the limit for declarer|pg||
nt|brolucius: If 1NT was natural, perhaps it denied three spades, which would be useful information for North.|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|friggi: no problem. play for @D 3-3 |pg||
nt|pelu: so 2Nt would be 16-17 (18)|pg||
nt|rv: all of us like to upgrade the hand more often than downgrade, here North hand is clear candidate to downgrade|pg||
nt|marcsmith: are you sure this system isn't Imprecision?|pg||
nt|xenya: was a long pause on mine too|pg||
pc|s9|nt|fabsayc: i think in new zealand would be simpler to alert natural bids|pg||
nt|brgpro: N doeant need @cQ to bid 7@H|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: interesting -- could only do that because of @H10|pg||
nt|ahollan1: glad i'm not at the table -- as declarer i'd go into long tank because of too many possible lines|pg||
nt|npcjpn: nice bidding.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: should be a formality to make it now, wd|pg||
nt|pelu: agree - 2NT is a bid u dont play - either 3Nt or 3@c|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think 1@D followed by 2@C is systemic in Precision|pg||
pc|s3|nt|rodal f: How may HP would u have shoved me by that sequense RV?|pg||
nt|brolucius: 4@C was a cue-bid and 4NT doubtless RKCB, hearing of two aces and the queen of hearts.|pg||
nt|brgpro: so an easy 7 bid|pg||
nt|brgpro: a coffee hand i think|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  for play, yes|pg||
mc|11|nt|henryb:  because I think you need 3N to show a very different hand: say Ax, xxx, AKQxxxx, Q|pg||
nt|ahollan1: a) @S ruff  b) @SQ @CAK float @DQ c) @SK then ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: 5@CX on its way down three - would be even from S.  Was all set to praise S's discretion.|pg||
nt|marcsmith: is that a word? :)|pg||

nt|h_karluk: easy 13 tricks after that lead, bye bye to @d A|pg||
nt|sundiszno: next hand, next slam :)|pg||
mb|1C|nt|fabog:  1@C = any strong hand with 5+ controls, 7+ paying tricks 13+ HCP|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+  [but not 22-24 BAL]|pg||
nt|xenya: and, again, slam in 2 suits|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: 1@D=0-7|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i wonder they ve an ordinary new minor auction or not, now we'll see|pg||
nt|fabog:  2@D = 1-3 control with an 8-card suit|pg||
mb|2C|nt|ritong: 800 EW the most frequent score other room so far|pg||

nt|fabog:  OK :)|pg||
mb|2S|mb|3C|nt|ahollan1: 1@H=4+@H  Forcing 1 Round|pg||
nt|fabog:  pass on 2@D = 3+ diamonds 2+ controls|pg||
nt|sundiszno: now I think they have no other choice but to bid slam|pg||
mb|3D|nt|h_karluk: 2@c could be an innovation|pg||
nt|andreasw:  2@c would problebly win|pg||
nt|henryb:  How nice to have a penalty double available|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but not today|pg||
nt|henryb:  so few of us do at low levels these days|pg||
nt|h_karluk: exactly|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: true|pg||
nt|h_karluk: allright as that's easy maybe time to give a short brief for kibbers|pg||
nt|sundiszno: maybe only 4@h would have been better|pg||
nt|andreasw:  :)|pg||
mb|4N!|nt|ahollan1: 3@C = jumping in after allowing opponents to exchange info|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i.e  why not 2@C over 1@D|pg||
nt|h_karluk: There are two generally acknowledged strengths of the strong club systems|pg||
nt|h_karluk: accuracy in uncontested slam-strength auctions, because the bidding starts at such a low level when opener has a fairly strong hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: or pass over 2@H|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and fact that all other opening bids have their strength capped by the strong club means more accurate judgment and scope for tactical operation both in constructive and ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: competitive bidding|pg||
mb|5D!|mb|p|nt|vugraphzmz: now explaining the plan|pg||

nt|frankaus: brb|pg||
nt|friggi: but N should never play@H|pg||
nt|sybarra: club lead was key for defense |pg||
nt|janm: very tricky hand, obviously, and difficult for declarer to realize that it was necessary to do the very unintuitive thing of stranding the club A in dummy|pg||
nt|henryb:  is that desirable?|pg||
nt|pelu: no but that their system|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right -- i still don't know best line -- even looking at all hands|pg||
nt|rodal f: One thing is to precume if u show less than u have. An other thing is to show ure pard what u have.|pg||

nt|fabsayc: either that or initial control responses of some kind|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: sorry they got a bit fast then !|pg||
nt|pelu: 5@d - bit not 3NT|pg||
nt|gracelin: a close 3NT for NS.|pg||

nt|brgpro: the play and defence in 4@s will be interesting here|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 37th board|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: unfav 1st/2nd = 131-15|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ahollan1: or 13-15|pg||
nt|sybarra: :)|pg||
nt|rv: North's hand is close to an upgarde for 15-17 nt range|pg||
nt|barnets: north has a super max and 4@S will make|pg||
nt|rv: some might open 1@c and rebid 2n|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so the asking bids are in a range context|pg||
nt|gracelin: South will be more cautious in making his Vul. 2-level overcall|pg||
nt|brolucius: Despite that grand slam, there has been little excitement in the deals so far. It will come (we hope...)|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: 1m - 1M - 3NT is the hand u show|pg||
nt|ahollan1: TRF |pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Looks like Norths diamonds vs the opps respective hearts and spades in this one|pg||
nt|pzpp: agree, players just think for a long time, then play like zip,zip, zip|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: they do not always show their cards|pg||
nt|rnmalik: np-look what a hand anything beyond 5@C by NS, the trouble starts.|pg||
nt|gracelin: probably due to fail, though.|pg||
mb|1S|nt|friggi: play E for High @S |pg||
nt|friggi: let opps play @H|pg||
nt|barnets: i prefer that yes|pg||
nt|barnets: too strong for 1N|pg||
nt|henryb:  North's diamonds do not win the battle|pg||
nt|tejjyid: may be tough to decide though|pg||
nt|gracelin: another Precision auction, 1S shows a positive hand with Heart.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Good to get a board like that in early for E/W -- sets a great tone, "You will be punished if you step out of line"|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: what system for new zealand|pg||
nt|janm: Also hard for N to realize that he needed to play the second club to cut declarer's communications :) (I'm not sure why declarer had played the heart ten though - if he hadn't he'd ...|pg||
nt|janm: have been able to overtake the heart J)|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: 4@S by E has chances but the bad break should scuttle it|pg||
nt|pelu: no - I am old Acol-player, so distribution forst - that can improve a hand - and then cue/asking|pg||
mb|2H|nt|friggi: @C lead not enough|pg||
nt|sybarra: do you ever super accept with weaker nts?|pg||
nt|sybarra: I dont play them, so just asking |pg||
nt|ahollan1: i was just going to say that Newell COULD have bid 3@H as SSGT super-accept  [short suit game try]|pg||
nt|sybarra: for an older person such as me,  I would have to do too much "re-thnking" of system |pg||
nt|henryb:  Is 2@d a transfer or an amorphous force?|pg||
nt|rodal f: 4@S ok by 100% hit by the guesses. Might 3NT is better. But....|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3NT an easy make.|pg||
nt|marcsmith: i am imformed that Imprecision is French for 'lack of precision'|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Glad to see that the East hand was not an opener even in Precision, although I know that some do open|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: South will pass here in all likelihood, if he had Inv strength he would have Xed 2@c to set up forcing auction till 2n|pg||
nt|h_karluk: oh yes they want to be in NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So strong club for the boss, unlike Fu and Jack who play natural 2/1|pg||
nt|gracelin: south's 1NT is limited to 7 HCP the most, and could have less.  So north may give up.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: no overtricks in @s contract|pg||
nt|wygbe1: routine 3n on this one|pg||
nt|xenya: W has a choice now|pg||
mb|3N|nt|janm: Can't tell from the auction, can we? 1@c was alerted, as was 1@d. I'd have said we still didn't know from the alert to 1@c, but probably now it was a strong club and negative ...|pg||
nt|janm: diamond - still not certain|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i am told precision|pg||
nt|janm: And what was 2@c by East?|pg||
nt|henryb:  West now emerges with 3N?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i started old -- thinking systems has helped me regress|pg||
nt|sybarra: One Kib suggested bidding  3@H over 2@H (4 crd support, xx in @H)|pg||
nt|barnets: so n/s miss a decent game patly as a rsult|pg||
nt|rv: South chose to pass 2@c and subsequently 2@h since he suspected misfit|pg||
nt|rv: at MPs, many of us would act with South hand|pg||
nt|barnets: cant see why south did not bid 2@S|pg||
nt|xenya: 2N by N now, passing the bucket|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, you play whatever the boss plays, Roland.  Is that a rule ?|pg||
nt|brolucius: West may need a transfer break to promote him to game. No, he has started with Stayman.|pg||
nt|brgpro: W elected to start with stayman, then 2@s shows an invitational hand with 5@s and prob. unbal. hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwi_joker: the latter i believe|pg||
nt|rv: not my choice for 2@c opening if it shows strong hand|pg||
nt|tejjyid: still, perhaps theywill explore for 6@D and stop in !5|pg||
nt|jcwla: Uncomfortable decision now for S -- has alerady seen a much better 6-card suit than this go for 800 a level lower.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: certainly gave S, someproblems |pg||
nt|npcjpn: Facing passed partner?|pg||
nt|pelu: here my "favorit" convention (when opp play): 1NT F1 :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes|pg||
nt|marcsmith: i confess i would open it even not playing precision :)|pg||
nt|marcsmith: a diamond lead would probably beat this|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not sure what their NT range is. If 13-15 3NT is a bit of a stretch. If 14-16 it's reasonable|pg||
mb|p|nt|friggi: the mistake was made by N leading @H after overtaking|pg||
nt|sybarra: N was dummy |pg||
nt|friggi: sorry|pg||
nt|sybarra: just "followed suit" |pg||
nt|friggi: dec|pg||
nt|pelu: almost 8 playing trick - and good gamble here|pg||
nt|barnets: at any scoring|pg||
pc|c3|nt|gracelin: 6H is a perfect contract for NS.  Guess NS will be there after a few cue bids.|pg||
nt|brgpro: i think he might manage 9 tricks though|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think North thinking a way to describe his hand further , ie 2N|pg||
nt|marcsmith: North hasn't heard of '4th highest of longest and STRONGEST'|pg||
nt|wygbe1: w probably downgraded his stiff h|pg||
pc|c7|nt|janm: After a strong club and negative diamond, I'd have thought 2@c would be natural|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not forcing, was passed hand|pg||
nt|pelu: are u sure -they have some support-hands in 1NT|pg||
nt|jcwla: CR having conn probs|pg||
nt|brolucius: They play that as invitational with spades. Some use the sequence to show a 2NT raise with four spades.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|sybarra: and another challenging hand |pg||
nt|sybarra: easier for us than at the table|pg||
nt|friggi: yes, sure it is|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: indeed, this won't make|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well i am just saying i dont play it forcing in this auction|pg||
nt|gracelin: south might bid 5H over 4D to ask spade control directly|pg||
nt|h_karluk: oh yes he bid that|pg||
nt|gracelin: a Heart lead will probably beat it.  |pg||
nt|Walddk2: There is also a rule 2. If you don't agree with the boss, rule 1 will apply automatically|pg||
nt|gracelin: but West will likely lead a D, which helps declarer|pg||
nt|h_karluk: good news no specific shortage at both sides|pg||
nt|brgpro: but looks like a @D lead...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i do not see any well rewarding lead in the scoring except @d4|pg||
nt|brgpro: interesting bd here, either way can win ( i mean declarer or defence)|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|fabsayc: apparently natual is passe|pg||
nt|pelu: here pd had the cards he need: @S-stopper, help in @H and 3 card @d so the suit is running|pg||
nt|tejjyid: to Nunn, the @H & @C valuesall look wated|pg||
nt|tejjyid: wasted|pg||
nt|pelu: Its a real top-match, Australia no 2 and Indonesia No 3, Taipie No 1|pg||
nt|gracelin: he did just that.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|fabsayc: natural|pg||
nt|barnets: n/s have the balance of points and the spade suit|pg||
nt|npcjpn: at least undoubled:)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I don't like a system where West can't show the @D support on this hand though|pg||
nt|pelu: results: http://www.nzbridgecongress.co.nz/pabf2010/Openxtab.html |pg||
nt|h_karluk: good hands good suits with cover cards|pg||
nt|brgpro: with @hQ as entry, he will do it i think|pg||
nt|gracelin: Jin gave credit to Fu's play by not passing 1NT.  Fu gave himself credit by accepting.|pg||
nt|brgpro: talking about playing with boss, Gunnar Hallberg is obvioualy an expert|pg||
nt|brgpro: still, u dont have 10 tricks, |pg||
pc|c8|nt|rv: good lead giving nothing away|pg||
nt|fabsayc: is one 10 in hearts from a decent game|pg||
nt|marcsmith: declarer will get clubs wrong tho|pg||
pc|c5|nt|friggi: that is nice:)|pg||
nt|janm: The bidding is more interesting than the play on this hand. It's out of our "ruffs to beat" set of hands, just a boring 10 top tricks, 3 losers |pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: no emotion shown !|pg||
nt|pzpp: facing 3NT, Lin had a big decision to make, his hand appears to be sourceful of tricks, just need a good @c suit and @s control to envisage slam|pg||
nt|pzpp: not sure of their agreement here, is 4NT just a general interest and natural invitation?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: ask about the 3@s bid|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  but even this helful lead doesn't mean taht play is over|pg||
nt|xenya: can be beaten if E wins and returns a @H, but tough|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  *that|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so far winning decision not much unique|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|sybarra: playing J to see if he can get accurate count |pg||
nt|pelu: yes missing @H10 not so bad - need a @c-lead to defeat|pg||
pc|c4|nt|pzpp: 3@s could be just a cuebid for @s stopper for NT purpose|pg||
nt|rnmalik: all cards badly placed, other than missing 2Aces, the Q@H.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: yes opps were asking|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|brgpro: once he told me, when playing with ur boss, the first thing u shd know is not the system or convention, but how much sugar he needs for his coffee!!|pg||
nt|h_karluk: there are 2 aces and 2 Kings needs to be knocked out|pg||
nt|gracelin: Good advice.  There are something to learn everyday :)|pg||
nt|brgpro: u have 3 side tricks, so need 7 trump tricks to come, the only way to do it is to ruff 2@c with @sAK|pg||
nt|brgpro: so if N switches to a trump now...|pg||
nt|marcsmith: the opening lead suggests that declarer should get clubs right|pg||
nt|marcsmith: since North has led a 4-card suit, the odds favour him holding a particular card (ie CJ)|pg||
nt|peachy: i think it takes wizardry and help to make this|pg||
nt|peachy: too much work|pg||
nt|marcsmith: gets clubs right, he would have made it|pg||
pc|c6|nt|friggi: this line is better the play for 3-3 @C|pg||
nt|friggi: then|pg||
nt|janm: I'm told that 2@c showed either diamonds or the Majors|pg||
nt|rv: declarer can still mis-guess all suits, generally trump lead is worthwhile if 1 hand is known to be very strong|pg||
nt|tejjyid: IMO, 3@D is mandatory aafter 2@S - assuming it's GF|pg||
nt|xenya: now declarer got a tempo |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  @h shift works even now|pg||
nt|marcsmith: declarer should have risen with HK at trick 1 to try to clear winners in that suit|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|rv: if South doubles 2@C and subsequently bids 2@S it is likely to be forcing, passing 2@c and bidding 2@s should be NF|pg||
pc|s4|nt|rv: South took conservative route since he suspected misfit/bad breaks|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|cascade: suction|pg||
nt|pelu: I play 2@S FG, and then 3@D id the obvius bid over 2NT|pg||
nt|tejjyid: me to|pg||
nt|brgpro: now he makes i think|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jcwla: Meanwhile, 17 and 18 have come in -- 17 just 2 to Indonesia for staying a level lower in @H's, but 18 the big one: 14 to Indonesia for 800 here and 100 in OR against 5@HX.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Those are the type of boards that decide IMPs matches.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: 10@s played in error, penalty card|pg||
nt|xenya: to set up a club trick|pg||
nt|brgpro: even on @h shift now, wouldn't E be thrown in at the end?|pg||
nt|gracelin: maybe too late, declarer doesn't need to establish both minor suit winner, East wll be end-played at the end to yield an extra trick for declarer.|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Xu HOU is a World Master, in Shanghai 2007  XINYUANKONGGU - Transnational Teams, also Beijing 2008 - Transnational Teams A - EVERTRUST HOLDING GROUP were his teams|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|fabsayc: that has the unattractive name of suction|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right -- i think that's what I said Shirley -- but it is not obligatory [especially with min]|pg||
nt|gracelin: of course, declarer might not know how the cards lie and may play for spades to break.|pg||
nt|gracelin: Wang, over 100-millions Wang are rooting for you to take HK.|pg||
nt|brgpro: i put up $1 for making|pg||
nt|ritong: i take|pg||
nt|ritong: hello there|pg||
nt|gracelin: I take only if East put his HK now.|pg||
nt|marcsmith: then club guess gives him 9 tricks|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|nt|frankaus: g2g tu all|pg||
nt|pelu: @s3 is not the system card: 1. signal Low-High = even|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Henri|pg||
nt|h_karluk: will fare wretchedly, but it's more difficult to predict as east just how badly +600 will score|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|tejjyid: buti once played fit-showing jumps as well, so I couldstart with 2@H|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|tejjyid: That's a good method, but it doesn't happen often enough to take up a whole bid|pg||
pc|s6|nt|pelu: Taipei bid the slam and found their 6 trick against 3@H = 8 + 13 IMP|pg||
pc|s2|nt|marcsmith: they've let it through any way|pg||
nt|marcsmith: someone has to play a diamond at some point|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|pzpp: to make the hand, declarer may have to take @h finesse to dispose his 1d duece|pg||
mc|10|nt|pzpp: @d2|pg||
nt|rnmalik: The squeeze may come handy-all three vital cards are in one hand that is W.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: the opening lead was the central issue at both tables|pg||
pg||

nt|h_karluk: as Henry predicted off one|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|fabog:  1@D = 4+ hearts|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think N or S make 3N if they play straightforward, North's 3N better|pg||
nt|h_karluk: no worries pls, u served well 1st half 20 brds and a short break for another 20|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@S=11-15 HCP, 5+@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i thought he just might [keyword] start with 1@D|pg||
nt|3for3: Steve Robinson would be proud|pg||
nt|ritong: mm|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ahollan1: Danny -- you aren't the only one who mentioned Steve there|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, strange result from the other room|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 1st trick misplayed|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i meant in OR|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: but here we're in context of precision  where 1@D=1+|pg||
mb|2H|nt|3for3: and it seems to work well here, catching 4 card support|pg||
nt|geot: South has a huge hand, and in the CR he bid 5@C over 4@S in the second bidding round. No success.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: when i open 1@S -- partner's pointed suits are flip-flopped|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and after a losing @d Q hook, story over|pg||
nt|h_karluk: declarer finessed vs KQT@H at trick 1|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: I'd start with 2@C then double later.  More flexible to END with double :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: http://www.bridgebum.com/multi.php|pg||
mb|3N|nt|xenya: not quite over, but close, yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: claro que si|pg||
nt|geot: 3@S pre-emptive. Huang hopes for an ace with partner, but anyway 4@S is ok.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 2@s in original theory Inviting game in hearts if that is opener's suit, but signoff if opener's suit is spades. Opener can rebid 3@h (signoff), 4@H (signoff), or Pass with spades. ...|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|xenya: he finessed the 10 |pg||
nt|sundiszno: no, playin the 9 is good against QT and KT, and bad against KQ with the opening leader|pg||
nt|xenya: that's what i mean -- 9 is the right card |pg||
nt|sundiszno: 1@d meant 4+ @hs, a kib asked|pg||
nt|h_karluk: lead M.U.D.|pg||
nt|xenya: same thing might happen here, in theory, but i don't think it will|pg||
nt|h_karluk: declarer have the luxury losing a @d |pg||
nt|sundiszno: if east getting the lead, and plays a small @h, what will you play?|pg||
pc|d5|nt|geot: same auction. Most likely push, but there are only three top losers. |pg||
pc|d4|pc|d7|nt|3for3: when declarer tries to draw trump, his heart ruff in the dummy disappears.  can still guess hearts for 1 loser though|pg||
nt|geot: I am counting one in trumps, not practical to solve that one....|pg||
nt|ahollan1: since this is public forum i don't think i'll admit i would NOT open 1@S|pg||
nt|ritong: mm...say you draw two trumps|pg||
nt|geot: We will win 5@C:) seeing all the cards.|pg||
nt|ritong: then a top @h|pg||
nt|ritong: after that, a @h to the 8 caters with all, seems|pg||
nt|ritong: but declarer might go for @h Qj bare|pg||
nt|geot: yes|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s8|pc|sJ|nt|geot: which would have made him make the contract|pg||
nt|ritong: he does not know for sure, east could be just 5/5|pg||
nt|geot: ooops.....closer now|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|geot: to solve trumps. Then he will solve hearts too|pg||
nt|fabog:  Yes, West's opening lead can be from Kxx|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ahollan1: digression:  in the U26 match  after 4 comparisons Australia 15  Singapore 4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they began the match with Austalia leading by 1.33 VPs|pg||
pc|s6|nt|geot: wd!|pg||
pc|sA|nt|3for3: One hurdle cleared|pg||
nt|ritong: home and dry now|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sQ|nt|h_karluk: i don't think such special 2@d agreements can cause to catastrophic results|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: Huang known to be on minimum, so must be distributional for @S.  since Wu 3@S bid show 4, Asbi may actually be able to read  5161 or 5251|pg||
nt|geot: He will pull the trumps now, and then low heart from dummy. When the Q comes he is practically safe by playing a low to the nine. Unless West has played the ! from Q-9.......|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry -- Henri did already say that|pg||
nt|ritong: np|pg||
nt|ritong: always good to see we agree|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i have many acquaintances who would say that it is BAD to agree with me|pg||
nt|sundiszno: weel, now it's clear |pg||
nt|h_karluk: and can be from 10xx right?|pg||
nt|fabog:  Yes,|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|h7|nt|andreasw:  should be -3 at least|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ahollan1: and relatives|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|geot: Playing the Q from Q-9 in this situation is the only defence to make declarer go wrong. If the nine comes he will bang down the other honor and concede only one heart. |pg||
pc|h5|nt|ritong: not my point to argue, but YOU are agreeing with ME:)|pg||
pc|c2|pc|hJ|pc|hA|pg||
mc|9|nt|h_karluk: sometimes you should pick lesser evil, you know|pg||

pg||

nt|friggi: agree|pg||
nt|henryb:  4@s or 1?|pg||
nt|sybarra: and I think S put his queen of hts in his pocket, even without the @H bid by W |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I thought -2 claim accepted|pg||
nt|h_karluk: in 2008 they were Bronze Medalists|pg||
nt|ritong: pat does not, he prudently put a condition|pg||
nt|brgpro: u dont have i am afraid, but i will be glad to take 1 euro instead|pg||
nt|brgpro: i think he will go down|pg||
nt|brolucius: Both sides did well to bid the game anyway. At the other table, West made a normal transfer response and raised the 2@S rebid to 3@S, That was good evaluation.|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  I would bid 4|pg||
nt|rv: have the rains stopped in South Island?|pg||
nt|gracelin: NS may get highest mark to reach 4S in a bidding contest.  Not here as West is waiting with 5-card spades.|pg||
nt|ritong: assuming you keep the lead til the end, though|pg||
nt|brgpro: W will raise to 3NT with 4333|pg||
nt|wygbe1: h opening lead might have caused some problems, but very difficult to find|pg||
mb|2C|nt|sybarra: bidding it more of a challenge now |pg||
nt|friggi: not good bid at all|pg||
nt|janm: New Zealand's IMPs came from board 2, where EW were allowed to play in 4@c and didn't make it (so that was a chance for a Hong Kong pickup if they'd gotten the spade ruff to beat ...|pg||
nt|janm: 4@h)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=ART, STR, F1, (good 13)14+ HCP unbal, 15+ HCP BAL|pg||
nt|rv: 2@c is possibly single suiter here|pg||
nt|brgpro: after @h lead, only need @s guess to land|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, you can see that 4@S has plenty of losers to cope with. That is exactly why 3NT is recommended on 4-3-3-3 shape.|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: The Hong Kong IMPs are from board 3, where the HK N bid game over his partner's 2@s opener|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it gets stronger in 3rd/4th|pg||
nt|barnets: 3N makes for 600 against 2@DX for 500|pg||
nt|brgpro: 14-16 NT they play i believe|pg||
nt|marcsmith: 7H a good save against 7D but then EW can bid 7S to gain a couple of IMPs|pg||
mb|p|nt|friggi: 3@D helps opps more the p|pg||
nt|ahollan1: DBL=6-9 HCP|pg||
nt|pelu: partscore hand in @s or @h|pg||
nt|pzpp: NS may reach another doomed 3NT|pg||
nt|gracelin: Let's bet for bigger things.  Brazil or Italy ?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Spain|pg||
nt|brgpro: pass?|pg||
nt|marcsmith: 5H for me|pg||
mb|2S|nt|sybarra: and E  does not have a good cue here   qx of @H's not easy |pg||
nt|sybarra: oh good E bid 5 @C |pg||
nt|pelu: U can find CC's on: http://www.pabf2010.co.nz/Participants/Convention-Cards/Open/Australia.aspx|pg||
nt|ritong: sorry about that, i m not a soccer fan|pg||
nt|ritong: undo|pg||
nt|brgpro: W must have mis-sorted his hand|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i do not know, pass shld be a speculative choice|pg||
nt|brgpro: missed 1 A or K|pg||
nt|marcsmith: 4H doesn't seem enough facing a passed partner|pg||
mb|3C|nt|friggi: right|pg||
nt|henryb:  So did East: 4@d shows a good 4@s.|pg||
nt|pelu: also my bid - the hand is too weak to 4@D (namyats)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C takes them out of relay mode -- i think|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: meanwhile closed room seems to have gone to sleep|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Hans must have missorted his cards|pg||
nt|brgpro: Italy????? I am afraid u r not up to date patrick|pg||
nt|peachy: still, better than 3H in other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  I think Namyats should be a better hand than that|pg||
nt|pelu: CC: just a solid suit - but I agree with u|pg||
nt|pelu: and not "solid" :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  My rules (back when I played it) was no 3-loser suit, and not two suits with two fast losers|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or maybe DBL is relay -- i'm just not sure :(|pg||
nt|rv: at any other colors, West will gleefully doube 2@d, he is likely to bid 3n at these colors|pg||
nt|pelu: Grant like to bid - but he has no bid|pg||
nt|marcsmith: yes 3H is hopeless|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: but, as R does, i would be glad to see spain winning it|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: is this a slam that is biddable?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it is very possible that 3@H=exact shape|pg||
nt|rodal f: The lead at match and team is? not @C but thrumph.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the all seasons double comes to his rescue|pg||
nt|pelu: a slow X = pd my distribution is not OK :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: now should pass|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|vugraphzkt: nope :(|pg||
nt|pzpp: I think that Mr. Lin had a misunderstanding of this 3@c|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: thinking|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i guess 2@h wld be nice instea of 2@c|pg||
nt|marcsmith: hard for E to move over 6S|pg||
nt|marcsmith: 5H first seems better by West|pg||
nt|marcsmith: suggests two places to play|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sybarra: 3 @D bid not recommended at home |pg||
nt|sybarra: or maybe only at home LOL|pg||
nt|friggi: agree|pg||
nt|friggi: helps W to count that hands|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe "we" are on our way |pg||
nt|ahollan1: so YES Shirley|pg||
nt|tejjyid: itsvery disciplined to take 2 passes on that hand; mabe he will balance over 3@H?|pg||
nt|gracelin: The whole Xinyuan team represented China in the 47th PABF championships played in New Zealand in late May.|pg||
nt|gracelin: NS play a 10-12 mini-1NT opening. |pg||
pc|d3|nt|janm: 3@s presumably Smolen, showing a game force with 4 spades and 5 hearts, so that partner can play the hand in hearts; they know they don't have an 8 card fit in spades already|pg||
nt|fabsayc: what to lead|pg||
nt|janm: 3NT is going to be very difficult to make here|pg||
nt|rv: E-W playing negative doubles and forcing pass till 2n after double by West to set up forcing auction|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Kaz Yamada|pg||
nt|npcjpn: now the lead is very important.|pg||
nt|rodal f: How many have missed how many times there:)|pg||
nt|xenya: 4@H here|pg||
nt|gracelin: I accept Italy if the stakes are right, say 1 : 100.|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|cascade: what do you lead from Miller's hand knowing that declarer is probably 4=3 in spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2 Key Cards + @HQ|pg||
nt|sybarra: but when I bid these,  hts are always 4/1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: lucky -- mine 5-0|pg||
nt|ahollan1: AND @S king offside|pg||
nt|kaz08833: hi all|pg||
nt|fabsayc: we are toungue in cheek with our comments, folks|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sybarra: LOL |pg||
nt|barnets: can south be stopped from scoring a second club trick ?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hi Kaz welcome|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: no emotion !|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: someone's tummy is rumbling here !|pg||
nt|rnmalik: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: seen the hand maybe !|pg||
nt|marcsmith: not a good advertisement for Precision|pg||
pc|cA|nt|fabsayc: i might lead spades as the least destructive|pg||
pc|c3|nt|rv: I like this treatment as well, prefer positive doubles if we have bid a 4+ card suit naturally and on a similar forcing auction|pg||
nt|npcjpn: nice lead.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: another long think|pg||
nt|tejjyid: There's some serious underbidding going on here|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|rv: East-West should time such defenses very well, need to combine punching declarer and remove his trumps|pg||
nt|barnets: if e/w tap dec he will make 4 @D tricks and a club|pg||
nt|pelu: why didn't S bid 3@D ?|pg||
nt|pelu: ven here its a make|pg||
pc|h7|nt|sybarra: pity the trumps dont break (just a joke) |pg||
nt|sybarra: yep k off,  I will let you play the 5/0 breaks, and count my blessings|pg||
nt|rodal f: But always 110EW|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ritong: probably they have a two wayed checkback, so 2@c initiates an invite|pg||
nt|ritong: however, it would work the same way with a one way stuff|pg||
nt|h_karluk: would it be a normal +620 or not, we will see how decl would tackle trumps|pg||
pc|h4|nt|janm: Hard to know what to lead, I agree; although leading a 5 card suit is often right, when it's a bad suit and dummy has 4 of them... So I think he's probably right to try to find ...|pg||
nt|janm: partner's suit, just unlucky that he chose the wrong minor|pg||
nt|barnets: if they dont tap he makes 3@D tricks and 2 clubs|pg||
nt|rv: b|pg||
nt|rodal f: y better|pg||
nt|pelu: I am not sure I would have bid on the East-hand|pg||
nt|gracelin: or 2C forces 2D, either to pass 2D or start an invitational sequence.|pg||
nt|xenya: looks hopeless?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i suspect|pg||
nt|h_karluk: it will score very well|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this seems to need 3-2 trump and nothing awful in @S|pg||
nt|kaz08833: it will go down 3 at least if E misguesss d|pg||
nt|marcsmith: EW much better placed after 1s-(4h)|pg||
pc|cK|nt|henryb:  He can make this, I think. @h to Q, @d|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so Great Shuffler on declarer's side this hand|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Only the Vul would make me think twice|pg||
nt|gracelin: a good steal.  No reason for West to elad a Diamond.|pg||
pc|c8|nt|xenya: well perhaps non-vulnerable, 3@C by S is permissible  |pg||
pc|s4|nt|rodal f: @SJ and|pg||
nt|rv: strange play by both West and North|pg||
nt|rodal f: Might vug maded wrong at the @S. |pg||
nt|rv: low @h from dummy could even lead to 10 tricks now|pg||
nt|rodal f: But he/she will come with a correct result.|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|gambit: cl already 6 or 7|pg||
nt|rv: min of 9 tricks for E-W|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: big think|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|pelu: DD u can make 4@S by playing @D in trick 2 - but then u need to see all 52 cards|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|fabsayc: if you can rely on double promising hearts he made the normal bid|pg||
pc|d2|nt|xenya: 2 more trumps and @CA for the defence|pg||
nt|h_karluk: given all the things that could lead to a very different result|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|sybarra: one sigh of relief so far |pg||
nt|pelu: NS's NT 1. and 2 : (11)12-14 - 3. and 4. : 14-17|pg||
nt|peachy: Competitive bidding as hard in Precision as other systms|pg||
pc|dT|nt|h_karluk: easy 9 tricks now|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|rv: here even double dummy, South can't be stopped from making 5 tricks as rightly pointed by Barnet|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Exactly, although dummy had shown four spades on the auction I suppose|pg||
pc|dK|nt|gracelin: maybe a 10 imps pick-up for Xinyuan|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|sybarra: hold breath now for spade |pg||
nt|ahollan1: NZ has won imps on every board so far -- this another likely swing|pg||
nt|sybarra: (that is spades breaking favorably) |pg||
nt|ahollan1: well -- wouldn't be surprised if swing, but 'likely' is an overbid|pg||
nt|sybarra: China seems to be pushing very hard at other table |pg||
pc|d6|pc|d9|pc|c9|nt|janm: So 3NT will make - it was important to lead clubs, not to start setting up N's 5-card suit, but to take the entry out of dummy|pg||
nt|rv: now 4 down|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: should be -2 now|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it sort of shows hearts and clubs actually|pg||

nt|janm: I was wondering about that too - I don't see how he could have done that, but does declarer really have time to set up a club? Say he leads the club Q, now what? North has better ...|pg||
nt|janm: club spots than declarer|pg||
nt|sybarra: note the spade suit play |pg||
nt|rv: strong start by Aus pair in this room|pg||
nt|rv: series of good boards|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: and that won't be a great result for China either|pg||
nt|rv: steady start by new Caledonia here, no drops so far from bottom placed team in the table|pg||
nt|pelu: a kiwi surrender - never :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: grant said good choice of suit !|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Testing hands.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: what a silent partner|pg||
nt|brolucius: Smoking out the @SQ with a lead of the @SJ is a trick that East would rather have performed in 3NT.|pg||
nt|marcsmith: much harder|pg||
nt|peachy: against preempt, I meant|pg||
nt|peachy: natural opening at least gets one suit in|pg||
nt|marcsmith: indeed|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: good point Shirley -- must admit that i missed the safety play :(|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=3-10 HCP, 4+@S & 4+@C/@D|pg||
nt|marcsmith: 3NT is an interesting choice with a 9-card spade fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: but defense does not have enough tricks then|pg||
nt|janm: Declarer has 2 spades, 2 hearts, 2 diamonds (if he uses the club and heart aces for diamond finesses), 1 club, he really can't find 2 more tricks, can he?|pg||
nt|rv: no one likes to finish last and lose too many matches, pride of every bridge player|pg||
nt|tejjyid: They were in 4? OK, I take back my underbidding crack|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: sorry missed a bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: ehaa......for the S bid |pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry  2-8 HCP  --  i should copy/paste instead of trying to use recall|pg||
nt|sybarra: might be their system others call it Every, Hand An Adventure (EHAA)|pg||
nt|pzpp: precision 2@c|pg||
nt|gracelin: another Precision auction might see NS stop at 2S here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and a losing one|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|fabsayc: not sure|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: nice 4@S for the NZers here (even 3NT makes)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: and naturally interesting to watch-no play:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: i think so|pg||
nt|tejjyid: NP, these guys are prety quick, I imagine|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: battle of spades and hts, |pg||
nt|barnets: 3N and 4@S both make here|pg||
nt|peachy: i looked at the bidding, tough to say which E or W was at fault|pg||
nt|marcsmith: yes, 4S seems to be on the diamond guess, which you cannot get wrong on this layout|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|sybarra: and 4 @H's always "transfers" to 4 @S (for opps) |pg||
nt|cascade: i just checked double dummy and GIB thinks Miller needed to find the @c8 to defeat 3NT|pg||
nt|janm: Defense might get endplayed out of one trick, but 2? Hard to tell. And of course it isn't easy to lead the club Q either, just easier than leading low|pg||
nt|janm: But GIB lets declarer play double dummy too|pg||
nt|ahollan1: EHAA was never this creative|pg||
nt|kaz08833: 9 tricks plaing \s by NS, 8 tricks playing \D by EW|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They stopped in 1NT next door on 6, and that was all they could make as North was declarer|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: 2@s seems a gross under-bid here|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: ooops|pg||
nt|Walddk2: East had an easy diamond lead|pg||
nt|brgpro: this hand is tough for E....2@d is relay and after 2@h...2NT=GF which he doesnt have|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@S is head&shoulders as you can't go wrong in diamonds|pg||
mb|1H|nt|kiwi_joker: they really needed to find out about the nice secondary fit in @Ds to bid this one|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: yes very|pg||
nt|tejjyid: If that tempo reflected the table, I don't think much of it|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: thinking|pg||
mb|1S|nt|friggi: should do|pg||
nt|friggi: ??|pg||
nt|sybarra: well indeed that is true!|pg||
nt|rv: it is normally played as Invitational strength 8-9/10 hcp even with 4@s|pg||
nt|gracelin: we see again a GF 2D inquiry.|pg||
mb|2H|nt|janm: Ah, here we see science in action (not!)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well if 2s is minimum is quite reasonable|pg||
nt|sybarra: I only played it in midnight swisses|pg||
nt|barnets: you put the hex on australia|pg||
nt|rv: interesting contract to play and defend, I expect defense to prevail here|pg||
nt|rodal f: -1 and next? but normal bidding.|pg||
nt|pelu: In my book the N hand is too strong to splinter|pg||
nt|tejjyid: North should KNOW what he is doing over a 4@H cue when he bids 4@D|pg||
nt|h_karluk: USA EDT 00:30, 02:45, 05:00 there will be 16x3=48 boards in 3 rounds, stay with us please, that's a very nice broadcast|pg||
nt|h_karluk: here double could end the auction, easy to overboard after 2@c|pg||
nt|brgpro: but he has to stay with it|pg||
nt|brolucius: So, why play 2NT as GF?|pg||
nt|xenya: routine 4@H here |pg||
mb|2S|nt|cascade: 2@s will be minimum|pg||
nt|janm: They got to the right spot of course, but does N really know that his partner can't have enough for 7? Make the diamond Q the club Q for instance|pg||
nt|fabsayc: might gain by not helping defense to lead|pg||
nt|cascade: i am pretty sure they dont play 2/1 FG|pg||
nt|fabsayc: remember is precision|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: sorry there is no commentary here|pg||
nt|brgpro: that's the prec style|pg||
nt|marcsmith: really? I think West is completely potty|pg||
nt|marcsmith: assuming that 2C Q showed a spade fit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I get 11% every time I mention head&shoulders. Better than the 10% wash&go offered|pg||
mb|3C|nt|fabsayc: so 2s is definitely limited|pg||
nt|npcjpn: 3@s is not invitational, so pass looks automatic.|pg||
nt|rv: @h ruff or 2@s tricks in addition to 2 tricks each in @hs and @cs|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: yes precision 2@c|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: 11-15|pg||
nt|gracelin: 10 tricks will be made if defenders force declarer to ruff the 3rd club.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Most West's will open 1N in a club-system and east will give GF responds |pg||
nt|brolucius: Not as I used to play it.|pg||
nt|brgpro: 3@d=max with any red short|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: with 5@s and super-max for passed hand, I would have started with 2@h with West hand|pg||
nt|rv: lol|pg||
nt|barnets: as they miss a good game especially on th e bidding|pg||
nt|brgpro: 3@h=asking|pg||
mb|3H|nt|janm: Even if 2/1 isn't FG, couldn't he at least bid 2@c and then blackwood and tell his partner they had all the keycards and adequate trumps - S would know that AQx of clubs was golden|pg||
nt|rv: commentator's curse as Barnet rightly put it:)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if lead is fourth best, start looking elsewhere|pg||
nt|brolucius: Has he not already shown hearts?|pg||
nt|marcsmith: even crazier here|pg||
nt|peachy: oh dear|pg||
nt|marcsmith: and North even gave them a second chance|pg||
nt|xenya: E might make some noise, but they won't go overboard i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: fearing Heart ruffs, declarer may still play A, K of trumps to drop the SQ|pg||
nt|h_karluk: would you begin with 1@c?|pg||
nt|marcsmith: why can't East show real spade support with a Q rather than this silly 2NT|pg||
mb|4H|nt|rv: can even be 2 down now|pg||
nt|h_karluk: slam is not out of the question from East's pouint of view facing a sound opening bid with long diamonds|pg||
nt|h_karluk: however preferred to stay in 3N|pg||
mb|p|nt|tejjyid: and SOuth does not have enough to bid over a signoff, IMO|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, so he explored further after the 2H response.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: there is no elsewhere but you do look|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that'|pg||
nt|brgpro: 3@s=@d short, thus 3-4-1-5|pg||
nt|brgpro: 3@d=short @s or @d, sorry|pg||
nt|brolucius: 1@C is unattractive with no aces, so fair enough to treat it as a 15-count.|pg||
nt|ritong: no aces is a minus, for sure, but the hand is pretty |pg||
nt|marcsmith: Axx is hardly a great stopper|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|janm: Of course he doesn't have that, but he could have|pg||
nt|ahollan1: my last Regional event on East Coast I came in 2nd in Masters Pair with one of the Authors of EHAA -- Eric Landau|pg||
nt|h_karluk: not a fairly common treatment in North America|pg||
nt|brolucius: Do they not have a relay to ask how pretty the hand is?|pg||
nt|brgpro: but the 2NT was a bit scary for E, that's why with this hand prec. players will always be in 3NT after 2@c opening ( except they find @s fit)|pg||
nt|brgpro: 3@d=max already|pg||
nt|brolucius: I don't see much benefit in 2NT being forcing, once West has already told partner of his two best suits. That must leave East with no bid to make quite often.|pg||
nt|brgpro: they need to see if pd has 6@c or not, and the 3rd 3 card suit is important as well|pg||
nt|brgpro: so u need to lower ur bids to develop more|pg||
pc|s4|nt|janm: Or a sixth spade|pg||
nt|sybarra: were you playing that system?|pg||
nt|marcsmith: and did 3H show a shortage?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Settling for 3NT is unusual with the East cards. Aces are suited for suits (no pun intended)|pg||
nt|marcsmith: well East never showed primary support|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe he was hoping for AKxxxx|pg||
nt|marcsmith: and unlike the other table, he knew there were 6 spades opposite|pg||
pc|s9|nt|pelu: better J to kill @HK as entry for the 4. @d|pg||
nt|brgpro: 2@c takes a lot of room in the bidding |pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|h_karluk: s true sir|pg||
pc|hA|nt|vugraphzsm: 3h shows max|pg||
nt|marcsmith: ok thx|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|nt|pelu: I would never lead @D against 3NT - normal a @H and have @DA as entry or a shot in @S|pg||
nt|h_karluk: no way to get rid of 2 @c losers|pg||
nt|marcsmith: (1D)-2S-3D-4S seesm fairly obvious to me|pg||
nt|marcsmith: in that auction 4S shows max :)|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|fabsayc: all true but sometimes no science is better|pg||
nt|rodal f: @H10 drop auto. Can't miss 7 tr.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, I see that it can be useful when East has a strong hand. But quite a price to pay when you have a game-try range.|pg||
nt|brgpro: just over-bid a little. defence is tough too|pg||
nt|brgpro: one trick difference, no big deal|pg||
nt|ritong: :)|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|h_karluk: i don't think uncontested 2@c>2D; 2@H consumed space, natural bidders would also come 1@c>1@d;2@h, however 2@s would give better ideas|pg||
pc|h7|nt|henryb:  I think a @h is standout. not that it makes a difference on this hand|pg||
nt|barnets: maybe west should bid 3@S|pg||
nt|barnets: over the X|pg||
nt|rv: NS missed an opportunity to take a @h ruff followed by another @c ruff with @SK to come|pg||
nt|rv: now only 1 down with @HT coming down|pg||
nt|fabsayc: indeed defense is playing hand for declarer|pg||
nt|gracelin: no, but declarer may only lose 2C + 1D|pg||
pc|h6|nt|kaz08833: S might guess /s wrong|pg||
nt|rnmalik: good approach.|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|gracelin: guess 10 tricks too here|pg||
nt|ritong: 1@c 1@d 2@h?|pg||
nt|ritong: hmm|pg||
nt|ritong: forcing to game would be a tad rosy, wouldn t it?|pg||
nt|brgpro: he has 9 tricks already|pg||
pc|cA|nt|fabsayc: say defense needs to cash two clubs|pg||
nt|fabsayc: which is equally likely|pg||

nt|h_karluk: oops, now dec wld b able to draw 2 rnds top @s and pitch @c losers|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ditto sir|pg||
nt|h_karluk: cake and walk:)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Particularly as you may have to bid 2@D on such as 10-counts, in case there is a major-suit fit. You then need somewhere to stop if there is no fit and partner does not have a ...|pg||

nt|geot: Spade lead is normal.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@D WAS game force -- i wonder why 2@H on that terrible 5 card suit instead of natural 2@S |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@S must still show extra ala reverse|pg||
nt|geot: Maybe their agreement is that 2@S shows extra.|pg||
nt|geot: ecco|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: I expect pass|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 5@h makes|pg||

nt|pelu: 4@D or 4@s by West?|pg||
nt|rv: I intend to drive to game in any case and in my opinion 2@h gives more flexibility|pg||
nt|pelu: @HA was the gift decl need|pg||
nt|fabsayc: actually the heart return was the gift|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: toilet break :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: back|pg||
nt|pelu: 26 HCP |pg||
nt|jcwla: Nicely done by Liu with that @DT and score it up.  Meanwhile, 5 more to Indonesia as Chinese Taipei made 4@H in the OR but went for 800 in 5@CX here.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: anyone wanting to commentate please feel free|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and 3@c also, limit, natural|pg||
nt|brgpro: they are in different groups|pg||
nt|brgpro: hard to tell|pg||
nt|brgpro: 3@C is the only stop after 2@d|pg||
nt|brolucius: In a 5-2 fit. |pg||
nt|marcsmith: EW did well in the other room|pg||
nt|marcsmith: all those 10s in the West hand are like golddust|pg||
nt|vugraphzsm: Zhu is making an invitation by 3s|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ahollan1: hmmm will other room get to game after West open's strong 1@C?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: partner is a huge favorite for exactly two hearts|pg||
nt|rnmalik: another partial.|pg||
nt|tejjyid: not bad|pg||
nt|xenya: there was a fierce partscore battle in the other room |pg||
nt|gracelin: most clubs are sponsored by business and have 6-8 pros plus other members.  The clubs are closed and not opened to  bridge players in large.|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: 2@D = Multi|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3h is not my choice|pg||
nt|fabsayc: unless specifically agreed as a weak jump|pg||
nt|pelu: agree - bidding direct on Multi sh show a better hand|pg||
nt|brgpro: they hope to have 3@C when bid 2@d:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: I suppose there could be QJ in front of the K and A over it, but I don't think bidding scientifically will make it any easier for them to find that|pg||
nt|cascade: they have another chance to showcase their slam bidding|pg||
nt|pelu: see NSs problem after 4@s|pg||
nt|henryb:  somewhat difficult to get to 6@h-- maybe less difficult when West chooses not to open a large number of spades|pg||
nt|rodal f: Can blame the layout for EW at this board.|pg||
nt|gracelin: Will see another 1C opening to bring NS to 4S|pg||
nt|ritong: close your eyes, roland|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't mind weak with both majors|pg||
nt|gracelin: 2H is a weak opening with both majors, very popular in China,  guess.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: oh yes, i mostly play in Columbia Bridge Play South Carolina USA, when i see member records there is around 600, i cannot tell all are active, it was similar when i was in Turkey|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i believe Liu Jie has invitational values|pg||
nt|peachy: probably GF Stayman|pg||
mb|d|nt|pelu: 12-13 tricks on @Dq|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: both directions have hands that fit together beautifully.|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: This time S has a positive response to 1@c|pg||
nt|janm: Can they find diamonds?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H=ART, 9-13 HCP, 4+@S, 0-3@H, maybe longer @C/@D|pg||
nt|kaz08833: its highly likely NS will play 2NT which will go down|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: N must pass surely|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: 3rd bidding box landed on the floor in this session|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hmm, seems interesting 2@h there|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: I like 4@s here, max pre-emptive effect and tough for NS to get in|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Looks like each side can make 11 tricks in their best fit|pg||
nt|pelu: here a very popular convention X pd pass if u have the suit - In my opinion the convention dont work well - u can never X for penalty if u have a good penalty pd|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: whimp|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: oops|pg||
nt|jcwla: Uh oh.|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2NT forcing may be a playable method, but I had never heard of it before.|pg||
nt|brgpro: if N decides to rebid 2@h then it is tough to reach game|pg||
nt|brgpro: not knowing the super @c fit|pg||
nt|marcsmith: i'm betting they end in 6N|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: Or is 6@c okay too?|pg||
nt|cascade: do they need to|pg||
nt|henryb:  North MUST bid here; pass is not acceptable with that good a hand and heart support|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=ART, 5+@D|pg||
nt|barnets: not best|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: rescued|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i predict 4@s|pg||
nt|gracelin: with equal length in the majors, Fu chose t declarer the hand himself, an unlucky decision here.|pg||
nt|xenya: tough problem for N|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ahollan1: 2@D usually 2/3@D but ....|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@h = 4+ HCP|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Moysian fit but|pg||
nt|ritong: although mini flannery does not seem to optimize this board|pg||
nt|xenya: seems a wheel has come off|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sybarra: oh oh |pg||
nt|sybarra: but can W lead a @D easily|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 6c is better|pg||
nt|pelu: ok a bidding: 4@s P P 4NT - then 5@C (or 6@C) by N and 5/6@D by S = 2 siuter in red|pg||
nt|sybarra: may not be best spot|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Newell had option to bid 3@C showing MAX with longer @C|pg||
nt|barnets: Q|pg||
nt|marcsmith: which is certainly makeable but might need some guessing|pg||
pc|c7|nt|rv: South's action is surely too timid though it is hardly clearcut to bid at 5 level|pg||
nt|barnets: would show  the @HA|pg||
nt|brgpro: tough game to reach anyways, but will make 4|pg||
nt|h_karluk: :)|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|cascade: anyway the answer was yes easily|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 6@D likely down if diamonds 4-1|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 6@C would still have chances|pg||
nt|kaz08833: with other Q N shd pass it's unfortunate judge by N|pg||
nt|rodal f: Auto @S hook and a 50% @D hook for 10in @S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: perhaps but they have bid my multi suit a few times, and i am still spending the winnings|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 15% probabilty 5-1 break|pg||
pc|c8|nt|kiwibridge: the slam was NOT found so 13 well earned imps to CT|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: I kinda blame Stout a bit here .. he has chance to bid 3@C, which would have pushed pd's buttons (and they would never defend 5@Dx then)|pg||
nt|rv: I would pass 2@s with West hand, no Invite with 7 hcp, bid game only if partner super-accepts|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i was wondering how that 3@H bid would backfire|pg||
nt|pelu: in US and ? canada - the defense against Multi is not so commen as in Europe|pg||
nt|brolucius: Very tough and perhaps the game is not quite so good as it looks, despite the minor suit wonder-fit.|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and what after 2@c rebid? should S make next move? to 3@c, for example.|pg||
nt|marcsmith: North is endplayed at trick one|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sybarra: might see china gain some imps here|pg||
nt|tejjyid: slams all make with @S Qx in North|pg||
nt|jcwla: You might say...|pg||
nt|brgpro: possible 5 if N plays a @s now|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 2@c rebid would be nice|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sybarra: with the opening bid,  not easily |pg||
nt|ahollan1: that brings up point of extreme trivia - i was given URL that explains origin of "schneid"  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20061024124644AA8yaYF|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 3-3 36%. 4-2 48 %|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|janm: I assume all of this was natural after 1@c and 1@d, and 3@s is some sort of attempt to find NT|pg||
nt|janm: 6NT won't be a success|pg||
nt|henryb:  Would North's pass be forcing? I do not think so. And North could have much less, say AKJxxx in clubs and out|pg||
nt|fabsayc: where do we locate BBO|pg||
nt|pelu: :)|pg||
nt|xenya: what was 2@S, Jack? |pg||
nt|wygbe1: should get plus 100 here, 3n would have been interesting|pg||
nt|xenya: i would have bid 3N here|pg||
pc|c4|nt|fabsayc: oh is this blackwood|pg||
nt|rodal f: At the -edge for W but...|pg||
pc|d4|nt|janm: Surely if N jumps to 6@c, S should let him play there |pg||
nt|fabsayc: i would have bid 4@C over 3nt|pg||
nt|janm: I think 4NT is just a quantitative slam try, not Blackwood|pg||
nt|fabsayc: club queen has to be a big card|pg||
nt|cascade: south did well to move with no aces|pg||
nt|janm: Yes, but S seems to be thinking along NT lines, also if he bid 4@c wouldn't that make it sound as if 3@s was a cue bid?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Took it out.|pg||
nt|rv: West should surely pass 3@s after his invite|pg||
nt|jcwla: Always max pressure from the Indonesian pair -- no free space -- a winning style.|pg||
pc|c9|nt|barnets: well done|pg||
nt|pelu: for sure Herr exp a better hand by partner|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i have to fight everytime to play it live, mostly recently last weekend|pg||
nt|tejjyid: if theat 4 HCP is 2 Q's, East can stop here|pg||
nt|brgpro: after 2@c S will surely bid 3@c, then it is up to N to choose 3@h or 3@s, although i think the later is more likely|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i liked the unscientific auction better|pg||
nt|janm: Of course, N has a minimum and a void in partner's suit, so even with that nice 6-card suit and 3 aces, it's not unreasonable for him to pass|pg||
nt|pelu: here in denmark even "the old ladies" play Multi :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the final ruling was the event strength of the weakest team was over 8000 master points so multi allowable|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i swear this is true|pg||
nt|fabsayc: as opposed to my usual embellishments|pg||
nt|pelu: I trust u - and here we find that atitude vert strange (mild expression :))|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: big think and sigh|pg||
nt|h_karluk: likely pass or pull?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: simple and natural, keeps options open|pg||
pc|d7|nt|cascade: Stout does have spade stoppers but the @sAK and the rest of his hand are also suitable for slam|pg||
nt|janm: This one wasn't really very scientific either :)|pg||
nt|rv: he has bid his hand to the hilt by showing 5@s and 8-9 hcp|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 4NT quantative, I assume, so Nunn can cue@C |pg||
nt|h_karluk: only a favorable placed K is @h, rest offside|pg||
nt|brolucius: Sveta makes a good point. Perhaps a 2@C rebid is better than 2@H when you have @SK-x-x and there may well be a fit there.|pg||
pc|dK|nt|vugraphzkt: wants to lead @h|pg||
pc|d5|nt|vugraphzkt: changes mind|pg||
nt|marcsmith: not sure that 6N isn't better|pg||
nt|marcsmith: 1N-4n-6n|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|gracelin: won't take long to bring home 10 tricks|pg||
nt|brgpro: i would pass 2@h|pg||
nt|ritong: according to patrick, it was just hand hogging|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so EW will usually remain silent|pg||
nt|gracelin: Fu doesn't know which suit is longer in Jin's hand.  He could either pass 2H or to play 2S, I tk he chose 2S also because his hand may want to compete to 3h if opponent balance.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I'm having aircraft over my head almost constantly, even on a Saturday morning. Pretty annoying, but that's what you get for living so close to Heathrow when we have a westerly ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: wind (normal for Britain). I guess one can get used to that noise eventually|pg||
pc|h7|nt|wygbe1: i think 3n is makeable, by ducking the first diam|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: final scores for Round Robin  1 are posted -- http://www.nzbridgecongress.co.nz/pabf2010/Openxtab.html|pg||

nt|vugraphzkt: screen down !|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: paper discussion|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: screen up away we go|pg||
nt|jcwla: So one in each side suit and one of Rodal's coffee break boards.|pg||
nt|brgpro: but, dont u think 2@h is the most proper bid from N?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|pelu: I exp that @s are trump (4@c = cue bid with @s)|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|xenya: i'd be more concerned about missing a possible slam than going down in 3N |pg||
mc|8|nt|rodal f: By non vul u are so right RV. At vul I would bid 4 100 by 100 times after 3@S from pard|pg||
nt|rv: he can make this contract if he guesses everything correctly though|pg||
nt|rodal f: 2NT might a bit hard from Brison, but his pards problem.|pg||
nt|rv: needs to avoid double finesse in @s which he has successfully negotiated, next needs to play @cs twice towards dummy and then guess @d diamonds as well|pg||
nt|tejjyid: hmmph|pg||

mb|p|nt|ritong: wu: "quiet, me??":)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: bzzzt  sorry, but thank you for playing our game|pg||

nt|sundiszno: some kind of rubensohl here?|pg||
nt|xenya: might not be easy to reach it though after the intervention|pg||
mb|d|nt|geot: Karwur passed at the other table. Ended up scoring 590|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 6@d, 6@h. 6N, have no idea which one best under table pressure|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|ahollan1: what an incredible dummy to buy there|pg||
nt|ritong: thank you, pard|pg||
nt|xenya: looks impossible now?|pg||
nt|sundiszno: but anyway, 4@s is 800|pg||
nt|xenya: well who know|pg||
nt|h_karluk: well i think opp teams would play modified truscott|pg||
nt|xenya: *knows|pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: I guess a 4@S opening will get many votes too. A practical bid. |pg||
mb|p|nt|fabog:  pass from W = i prefer playing instead of defence|pg||
nt|xenya: and 5@D?|pg||
nt|fabog:  3-suited hand with 3-4 controls and shortness in spades|pg||
nt|xenya: that's what he has indded |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: notice DBL is NOT pure penalty as in previous millenium|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d3|nt|fabog:  If W understood it right, he must have bid 6 diamonds|pg||
nt|xenya: W is not on the same wavelength?|pg||
pc|dT|nt|fabog:  5 hearts is passable|pg||
nt|h_karluk: such as in Modified Truscott: 1 level bids are natural and weak single suiters,  X shows clubs, 1NT is clubs and hearts, 2C is clubs and diamonds,  2D is diamonds and hearts, 2H is ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hearts and spades, 2S is spades and clubs, 2NT is spades and diamonds    |pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|xenya: he must have misunderstood the 5@D bid|pg||
nt|fabog:  yes, i think so|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ahollan1: often over 4@S    DBL="transferrable values"  4N=2-suit takeout|pg||
nt|geot: Declarer must not try to be clever in hearts....He does not know the nice lay-out|pg||
nt|ritong: north is supposed to hold 4@hs|pg||
nt|geot: May be tempting to play South for ie. 9-x, ten from hand. |pg||
nt|ahollan1: south is supposed to hold east's hand|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|pc|c4|pg||
nt|ritong: but when he will appear to hold 2 @ss, this idea of 4 cards in @hs will decrease|pg||

nt|janm: The reason I think the strong club might hurt on this hand is more psychological than real - N starts out thinking he has a minimum and doesn't revise that idea|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the vague 3s and 4nt did them in|pg||
nt|janm: Another void opposite partner's long Major!|pg||
nt|cascade: he is minimum until he finds a fit|pg||
nt|cascade: then he has a very slam suitable hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: My guess is N/S feel good about their game, but not as good as it  will score up |pg||
nt|rodal f: So after the board: That was not as I would have done it. If E goes dow. And WD if home:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: internet connection a bit slow here|pg||
nt|tejjyid: so slam is at best 50%|pg||

nt|brgpro: but the suit quality is much different, |pg||
nt|brgpro: playing in part score, u like to be in the best suit|pg||
mb|1N|nt|rv: on @d lead, declarer pitches a @h, draws a round of trumps and plays a @c out|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Ino need to pass I feel, it usually goes wrong when you bid with that and Q@S was a good trump|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: wow - some interesting deals today|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: I know, but I just think that it's easier to recognize that if you start out thinking you have a lot in reserve for your opening bid :)|pg||

nt|pzpp: an easy 4@s?|pg||

nt|marcsmith: talking of noise -- how do you like those Zuzuzelers (or whatever they are called) that they blow constantly during the World Cup matches?|pg||

nt|Walddk2: http://www.ccba.org.cn/Tour/TourIndex.aspx?tourid=255  for the tournament website in Chinese Simplified; use Google for translation|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't think it's winning bridge to pass over 3@C with the East cards|pg||
pc|d9|nt|rv: is 2@c right bid? is strong hand transferring here?|pg||
nt|barnets: australia running away now|pg||
nt|pelu: 1@D = CRS = Colors, Rank, Shape|pg||
nt|pelu: 1NT = 11-14. Lead: right suit - wrong catd :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: Gar-bage here.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hearts are taking only 10 tricks|pg||
nt|brgpro: 4@h? wow|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|janm: I think you're about to get the prediction prize for the match!|pg||
nt|pelu: on Board 3 NS in OR missed the 3NT - bad range for 1NT opening 13-15 and pd had 9 good points|pg||
nt|npcjpn: 4 down?|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: NS havent bothered with their 6-5 heart fit  :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: v late alert 1@h|pg||
nt|fabsayc: crash and burn convention|pg||
nt|rnmalik: only @D lead can solve declarers problems |pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: 1@d explained as could be 3|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: worried look :(|pg||
nt|pzpp: no one will be happy in West's shoes|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: now saying some prayers|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: no inspiration forth coming |pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: now looking to the sky|pg||
nt|rnmalik: For discussion sake why did W not DBL 5@D?|pg||
nt|pzpp: anything there, I mean, in your sky?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: down to the floor !|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: rain|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: up to the sky again|pg||
nt|pzpp: rain, great, German says rain brings luck|pg||
nt|jcwla: This can't be the right M.O.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: reopening needed|pg||
nt|gracelin: north chose to double in other room, so south had an easy 4H bid.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i liked that 2@d|pg||
nt|h_karluk: tho passed hand|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 10 HCP, shortage in opener suit but showed his source of tricks|pg||
nt|gracelin: agree, but may not help to reach 4H with the 2D response.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: also true|pg||
nt|gracelin: north might play south for fifth Heart, since north has denied 4H when he bid 2D.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: anyways 3@h good decision|pg||
nt|gracelin: Good decision is to reach 4H :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and i doubt most would bid 2N, i guess even 3@c would be a minority vote|pg||
nt|h_karluk: just 7 hcp on vul vs nonvul and gives much info to opps|pg||
nt|marcsmith: 6H looks better than 6S, but still a tough make|pg||
nt|marcsmith: agree|pg||
nt|marcsmith: 4C showing clubs and a major would be normal|pg||
nt|marcsmith: oh ic 4C |pg||
nt|marcsmith: sorry|pg||
nt|marcsmith: i agree -- prefer 3S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I'll just bid 3@S|pg||
pc|h5|nt|henryb:  apparently E-W play a variable NT; weak nv and sound(er) vul|pg||
nt|babs59: Hi.  Please don't jinx them Barnet|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Stout will be waiting for his heart ruff at trick 2.   Bad news, Graeme  :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: Another steal. East shud double the 1NT opening to get in.  |pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, but the most important aim is to get to any game that may be playable. On that North hand there is a good chance that 4@S will be there if partner has five spades.|pg||
nt|brgpro: can easily be 7@s!|pg||
nt|marcsmith: i hadn't realized the opening was 3 CLUBS|pg||
nt|marcsmith: i was bidding over 3D|pg||
pc|h7|nt|rodal f: 10 and next|pg||
nt|pelu: 5 tricks in 1@H - so not so bad|pg||
nt|tejjyid: time for a quick coffee. On that lead, this will make buckets|pg||
pc|hK|nt|cascade: NZ gained another 11 IMPs on  5 when Grant Ker found a good 4@s dive which went undoubled!!!|pg||
nt|rv: ah this makes more sense|pg||
nt|kaz08833: NS only have to take 6 tricks or even 7 because EW can make 4@s|pg||
nt|marcsmith: not the ideal opening lead|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|sybarra: and a std. @S lead |pg||
nt|fabsayc: depends a lot on spots, here i totally agree with 2@H rebid|pg||
nt|pelu: yes 11-14 and 15-17|pg||
nt|pelu: good Acol-style|pg||
nt|rv: wlc Barbara, as neutrals we would like a much closer match:)|pg||
nt|babs59: I don't claim neutral status when Peter's playing :)|pg||
nt|jaheim: t|pg||
pc|d6|nt|cascade: well i dont know what you think|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Sartaj may ruff this and run 10@S|pg||
nt|jcwla: If you're willing to go there later, go there now with 2@S over 2@D.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think he will make this now|pg||
nt|marcsmith: not sure how|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Ruff a diamond|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and pitch one on @CA|pg||
nt|peachy: ruff two diam, has to be careful though|pg||
nt|marcsmith: indeed|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Then he has 12 tricks|pg||
nt|marcsmith: only needs one ruff|pg||
pc|d4|nt|sybarra: any reasone to cover? |pg||
nt|rodal f: By RV if u have to leave|pg||
nt|rv: Hi Rodal and specs, need to leave now, enjoy the game|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sad|pg||
nt|pelu: 500/430|pg||
nt|fabsayc: kind of like paying to see the hidden cards in poker|pg||
nt|gracelin: East was very serious with West's unf Vul. 2-over 1 overcall. but yes, 2NT had little to do with his hand.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: :)|pg||
nt|peachy: oh, only one ruff needed, even better|pg||
nt|peachy: not in seven|pg||
nt|marcsmith: surely right for North to play a trump at trick 2|pg||
pc|d8|nt|vugraphzkt: brief flurry of action|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|cascade: but i typically bid the six card suit unless there is a major disparity in the suit strength|pg||
nt|fabsayc: actually defense could slip and allow down 1|pg||
pc|dK|nt|marcsmith: actually right to lead a trump, which would beat it|pg||
pc|s6|nt|sybarra: n/s system should not be tried for novices....  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: and isn't even almost allowed in ACBL|pg||
nt|sybarra: and I do not know a defense to it|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe defense is just bid your longest suit |pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: Hou is examining the system card|pg||
nt|sybarra: but the "down unders"  (Aus and NZ) have always been "creative"  |pg||
nt|pelu: yes - not my style - but on the other hand - I dont like to see a long relay-bidding by opp|pg||
pc|d7|nt|rv: this should get beaten|pg||
nt|babs59: of course, I've just noticed his name showing as Paul Gill, but it's Peter Gill, and he's my brother|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, a very dangerous opening|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|sybarra: probably thinking S lead from kxxx|pg||
nt|barnets: maybe he should duck the @D|pg||
nt|barnets: another @D|pg||
nt|barnets: knocks out the ace|pg||
nt|rv: yes that would be a good deceptive play especially at trick 1|pg||
nt|barnets: and if east plays a third @D dec is home|pg||
nt|barnets: and in the newspaper too|pg||
pc|dA|nt|cascade: Michael Lawrence had some advice for 6=4s which i read many years ago|pg||
nt|janm: I think it's automatic to rebid the 6 card major with a relatively weak hand, but I've been told that's old fashioned :). Glad to hear some support|pg||
nt|jcwla: E/W quietly cede the lead here.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: for sure on another layout there might be a problem, however i know no pain no gain:)|pg||
nt|marcsmith: although perhaps declarer can squeeze South in the pointed suits on a trump lead, Diamond guess and trump continueation|pg||
pc|s8|nt|henryb:  Not the Acol I know. that is weak throughout|pg||
nt|rv: has a very good chance of working especially if West returns @D3 which may be difficult to read|pg||
nt|h_karluk: if you are committed to lose there would be gazillions excuses|pg||
pc|dT|nt|sybarra: welcome to Pat Anderson, USA|pg||
nt|fifee: ty Shirley :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not enough trumps to take the rest|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe down under= upside down  |pg||
nt|gracelin: NS will even make this|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|c2|nt|ahollan1: does that mean in NZ i'd be a morning person?|pg||
pc|s2|pc|h2|pg||
nt|cascade: his advice was with 6=4 rebid the suit with the most high card points|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe |pg||
nt|babs59: board 7 where Gill and Gosney missed game, OR  West opened 1S and passed partner's 1NT response (surely forcing?)|pg||
nt|babs59: so it was a flat board|pg||
nt|rv: declarer should have possibly cashed 4@cs instead of playing 3rd @d|pg||
nt|rv: that would have forced West to make 2 pitches and he might have got it wrong|pg||
nt|rodal f: If any are long at @H it's W. Play @H for the Q|pg||
pc|d2|nt|jcwla: But this has been their style throughout -- "maybe if we wish and hope and pray it might come true" -- that Indonesia will stay out -- but they don't, so get where you're going ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: asap.|pg||
nt|marcsmith: would have gone down if trumps were 4-1|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ahollan1: perish the thought|pg||
pc|c9|nt|vugraphzkt: got em|pg||
nt|marcsmith: declarer playing to make trick 14|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This line is scary|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|sybarra: or an all night person?|pg||
nt|rv: now if North cashes 4@s, West will be in some discomfort|pg||
nt|rv: 4@cs|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|fabsayc: here lau might have thought of not covering|pg||
nt|gracelin: that's 13 fat imps|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ritong: a kind of masterminding  " they are at fav, maybe they have a good sacrifice, let s go"|pg||
nt|h_karluk: interesting X by N|pg||
nt|brgpro: he was afraid of a nonvul. 5@d save...but comparing the risk of losing 6 or 7@s...i dont think 4@h is the right opening bid, even as practice...|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sK|pg||
nt|fabsayc: better spot cards|pg||
nt|rv: North missed his chance|pg||
nt|gracelin: Jin did not give credit to Fu's play this time. He would probably regret it now.|pg||
pc|h9|nt|fabsayc: AJxxxx   KQ109 i rebid clubs|pg||
nt|cascade: with QJT98x i would definitely rebid my six bagger|pg||
nt|janm: Where did the second diamond loser go?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: on clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: sorry, only made 11 tricks|pg||
nt|janm: And then what was it ruffed with?|pg||

mb|1H|nt|h_karluk: 3NT should be out of question|pg||
nt|xenya: good question|pg||
nt|fabog:  South could not find the club opening lead :)|pg||
nt|fabog:  North|pg||
nt|h_karluk: say did not find, still quick 9?|pg||
nt|xenya: still only 8 tricks?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i see 8 quick winners|pg||
nt|sundiszno: south ducked @dQ|pg||
nt|andreasw:  3nt has a chance and with hands like 4-4-2-3 and 4-3-3-3 could end up in 3nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i wonder if alert of DBL is  a) 16+ HCP  or   b) takeout of @H|pg||
mb|2H|nt|h_karluk: 5@h+2@s+1@d right?:)|pg||
nt|fabog:  lol|pg||
nt|h_karluk: lol|pg||
nt|sundiszno: seeing @cAKQxxx in his hand, is it a good idea?|pg||
nt|sundiszno: if there is not a club lead, you can strip the majors, and give south a @c, to lead away from @dK, as a kib suggests|pg||
nt|h_karluk: well, in my 1st club tournament tho i finished it with 58%, i passed my pertner's cue tho i agreed it as fit+gf, but that was 36 years ago, that 3NT would be quite friendly ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: neighbor defense|pg||
mb|3D|nt|sundiszno: but it doesnt workk since North also cvan win the @c|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|nt|fabog:  1 think 4 club means hearts|pg||
nt|fabog:  or simply asking for hearts, I am not sure|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 5@d fine, no way slam, unless @c lead there at trick 1|pg||
nt|xenya: hearts?? -- well yes, he has four of them... |pg||
nt|h_karluk: 4@h also saves the day|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: 1N questionable|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: passed p may be a deterrent factor to look for a slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|sundiszno: passed on 3@s|pg||
nt|h_karluk: however that 4@s might lead wrong|pg||
nt|h_karluk: showed extras|pg||
nt|fabog:  OK, so 4@C was asking bid, 4@H = 4-5 hearts, 4@S asking again|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|nt|fabog:  4NT = 5-card hearts|pg||
nt|h_karluk: csatlos did you play gambling 3N with Hittman?|pg||
nt|fabog:  yes|pg||
nt|h_karluk: then i think 4@c pass or pull|pg||
nt|xenya: i fear EW are going to have another misunderstanding but of course i'm not in a position to judge |pg||
nt|fabog:  but not in this situation|pg||
nt|sundiszno: 3NT is not gambling here|pg||
nt|h_karluk: quasi|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and i have no idea why 4@c not doubled|pg||
nt|xenya: good point|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @s lead might cost them expensive in case they landed 6|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's not questionable if 1@S would have shown an unbalanced hand. Many play that|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ok ty|pg||
pc|h2|nt|andreasw:  X-Y here?|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i closed my eyes|pg||
nt|fabog:  Now I dont understand this pass :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i was not here, i did not see anything, i want to forget this deal|pg||
nt|fabog:  :)|pg||
nt|xenya: well now S can afford to be brillant by ducking 1st @D? |pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|nt|Walddk4: Yes, looks like 2@C is a puppet to 2@D, then 2@S invitational with 4-4 in the majors|pg||
nt|vugraphzmz: yes:)|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s3|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dA|nt|pelu: the only lead that give defense a chance to miss the defense - better play low from dummy|pg||
nt|andreasw:  :)|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d6|pg||
nt|geot: Again a hand where the hand records/GIB will tell that 4@S is makeable. But that does not mean it is bridge|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ahollan1: presumably 3@H says Asbi is willing for Tobing to correct to 3@S -- so Wu not excited with his hand|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|geot: Often the maximum tricks available told us by GIB can only be made by playing against the odds.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: one of the Youth tables has already finished!!!  the other table still 5 to play with Australia leading 21-13|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|s4|pc|d9|pg||

nt|Walddk2: They are 2 there Patrick, so they are fine|pg||
nt|gracelin: got it.|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|pelu: 11 tricks in @h/@d for EW - 5@C would be expensive for NS|pg||
nt|gracelin: south hand is a classic Precision 2C opening, either 6+C, or 5+C plus a 4+ major.|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: Thanks, Alister :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: A contract wich is easy to fail at for EW|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i predict will be expensive|pg||
mb|1H|nt|sybarra: need to stay low here |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Can he make it if North leads his singleton spade? Unusual lead when you have a side ace, I know|pg||
nt|marcsmith: 8 tricks is the limit|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: eveything off  |pg||

nt|vugraphzkt: Asbi thinking about bidding 3@c ...|pg||

nt|vugraphzkt: pulled out the cards and put them back|pg||

mb|p|nt|fifee: @S lead is a killer|pg||

nt|sybarra: ok 2 nt is some minor bid,  Al,  need your help |pg||
mb|2C|nt|Walddk4: http://www.nzbridgecongress.co.nz/pabf2010/Openxtab.html  for standings after 12 of the 13 rounds in RR1|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hi all|pg||
nt|sybarra: did it mean specially wk @D's?|pg||
nt|sybarra: *specifically |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 25 starts with Precision 2@C on previous board -- it gets scary from there|pg||
nt|jcwla: 22 and 23 pushes in 2@S making 3 and 3NT making 4, respectively.|pg||
nt|marcsmith: declarer can probably win in dummy and play a diamond to the jack|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: how does this tourney work ?|pg||
nt|itinerant: 2S = 4+clubs, 5+ spades|pg||
nt|gracelin: NS can take 18 tricks in NT, s guess they will also reach 7NT.|pg||
mb|2S|nt|alchilds: no low =2|pg||
nt|pelu: u owe me a coke, Martin :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: closed room EW made a wise stop at 3S, Club ruff beats 4S.  Same here.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: against 2@s what would be best lead|pg||
nt|ritong: @d|pg||
nt|marcsmith: not a tough defence here -- CK get count signal and switch to a diamond|pg||
mb|p|nt|friggi: agree|pg||
nt|janm: He knows he probably has the best hand at the table, but that doesn't necessarily translate into the ability to take 8 tricks|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not 2@D|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Amanda, Henry, Peter|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yes @D preempt|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: swing both ways on 19 4 more CT|pg||
nt|fabsayc: you did not accept|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: tight match so far|pg||
nt|h_karluk: interesting 4@h, the question how to reach|pg||
nt|gracelin: provided there is no accident|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Indeed, you need to be very unlucky to go down in 7NT, but it is possible on certain layouts|pg||
nt|brolucius: West should always raise with four spades, even if game is very unlikely opposite a passed hand. No point in allowing the defenders in at the 1@S level.|pg||
nt|ritong: leading a doubleton with a potential trump trick is not appealing|pg||
nt|marcsmith: interesting lead |pg||
mb|4D!|nt|janm: Well, he pushed them one higher, so I guess he was right|pg||
nt|fabsayc: maybe double|pg||
nt|barnets: do the top 8 play off or top 4?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: you can guess I play few partscores|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: But DBL should surely suggest some club length, shouldn't it?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2d suggests better diamonds|pg||
nt|fabsayc: double allows for 1nt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D/@H are Transfer Preempts -- only 3@C is nat pre|pg||
nt|babs59: Paul Gosney has also qualified for the Australian Under 26 team - which meant that for NZ PABF he has been replaced in the team|pg||
mb|4N|an| |nt|janm: True, but I'm afraid the doubleton club would keep me from doubling - I think I'd end up being a chicken and passing - maybe bid 1NT?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 21 it was|pg||
nt|davidstern: They may have right sided this to avoid a heart lead|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 14 HCP, worths|pg||

nt|gracelin: yes, Hearts 4-2 and clubs 5-1.|pg||
nt|ritong: here it works like a charm, though|pg||
mb|5C!|nt|babs59: but he will be representing Australia in the World Youth Series in Philadelphia in October|pg||
nt|davidstern: So 9 top tricks now 1-1-2-5|pg||

nt|henryb:  Roland!|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: sorry all we went down for a moment|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If you go down in 7NT with these cards, you should apply for membership of the VUPW|pg||
nt|h_karluk: :)|pg||
nt|brgpro: if N bids 4@C now, maybe but after 4@d i think the chance they will miss this grand is big|pg||
nt|gracelin: what's that, Rland? U want to apply .|pg||
nt|xenya: PW?|pg||
mb|5D!|nt|sybarra: welcome Al |pg||
nt|barnets: i am told its a double round robin|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but since i dont drink coke, is ok|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I guess the lackof@C Q hurt them|pg||
nt|gracelin: I|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Very Unlucky Players Worldwide|pg||
nt|marcsmith: works ok but someone very wise once observed that God doesn't deal you A-K so you can lead xx|pg||
mb|p|mb|5S|nt|janm: However, pushing the opponents up a level was certainly a good thing, because it looks as if 2@s will be very difficult to make|pg||
nt|fabsayc: partner will only bid clubs with 5, then the support is adequate|pg||
nt|barnets: tks |pg||
nt|barnets: nick|pg||
nt|babs59: I understand that this year it's a double RR and then the leading team wins|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: please wake me up when the high-tower auction ends :)|pg||
nt|xenya: excellent 6@S here, failing on a terrible trump layout|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: both East and West are looking at their dangerous club holding to stop at the safe 3S.  Good decision.|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: Your partner, maybe :)|pg||
nt|pelu: 232 VP - 223 - 218|pg||
nt|kaz08833: now 11 tricks|pg||
nt|gracelin: Then I withdraw my application.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We are 28 million members|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|fabsayc: get a new partner jan :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if i had say 2524 i would rebid 2c|pg||
nt|janm: Once upon a time, I doubled 1@d with 4441 (in that order). My partner waited until the 4 level to bid his 4 card club suit!! Taught me :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so i think here double suggests some diamond length|pg||
nt|janm: I would be more likely to DBL with 2524, and certainly with 1534, but I think you're convincing me to bid 1NT|pg||
nt|rv: Official tourney url is http://www.pabf2010.co.nz/|pg||
nt|jcwla: Surprising pass -- that dummy is just so trick-taking in @D's on this auction.|pg||

nt|davidstern: 2-1-2-5|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 6 level needed to play a slam? |pg||
pc|dT|pc|dK|pg||
pc|hT|nt|friggi: not the best line:)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: over reverses Iplay Blackout (o a variety) so I Can set @C with 3@C imediately|pg||
nt|tejjyid: no space filing 3@D bids|pg||
pc|h3|nt|pelu: I would bid 6 on the East hand - and make 6@c on an endplay on S :):)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|fifee: great defense though|pg||
nt|brolucius: South would not lead the 9 from @H9-x-x, so North could read the lead as a likely doubleton, holding up her @HA  so that it would be an entry on the second round.|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|henryb:  You cant take enough ruffs, so might as well play the @hQ|pg||
nt|henryb:  Indonesia currently 2nd, Chinese Taipei first|pg||
nt|babs59: however in other years this is the Zonal selection event for the Bermuda Bowl (and Venice Cup / Seniors) - in which case there are SF and Finals|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s9|pc|sJ|nt|fifee: down 2 now|pg||
nt|tejjyid: East has doneenough bidding|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|wygbe1: i think 6 is actually makeable dbl dummy via trump endplay, but in practice it would surely be down|pg||
nt|xenya: declarer will feel much happier in a moment|pg||
pc|cT|nt|janm: Best now is for N to lead a club and get his ruff |pg||
nt|cascade: but a diamond works too|pg||
nt|cascade: since declarer also needs to ruff a club|pg||
nt|janm: Interesting that a diamond will have the same good effect as the club ruff|pg||
pc|c4|nt|babs59: the Pacific Asia Bridge Federation is Zone 6|pg||
pc|c3|nt|barnets: i like semi finals and finals|pg||
nt|babs59: however the Zone 7 countries are also members - Australia, New Zealand, French Polynesia, New Caledonia|pg||

nt|barnets: better for the specs|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|sA|nt|gracelin: when declarer finds out south has 3S and 5C, he must have 4H and a singleton D, so D finesse at end is safe.|pg||

nt|jcwla: When W has Jxx -- can't argue w/success.  When doesn't -- will make a big chunk of the time.|pg||

mb|p|nt|sundiszno: one forth, we'll play 2 segments of 20 boards|pg||
nt|xenya: a quarter |pg||
nt|h_karluk: but that's part of the fun|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 4@S was a fine contract, two keycards were offside|pg||
mb|1H|nt|h_karluk: interesting 3@d|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk4: And it might even have made without it|pg||

nt|ahollan1: anybody for 1@S overcall?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other than me and Karwur :)|pg||

nt|Walddk4: EW would have to defend accurately|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: I don't|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: 3@c killed Kokish relay|pg||
nt|pelu: yes @S-lead and @S back and now diff to find the @c-shift|pg||
nt|h_karluk: seems 10 tricks|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ritong: at least 10 to taipeh|pg||

nt|gracelin: Tks Roland.  Got lucky.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: wow, congratulations Patrick, good job sir :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: Congratulations Patrick -- about the millionth one :)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  at least, play was fast )))|pg||
nt|h_karluk: :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: Hengsha is the leader after the first match and they are doing well again here. |pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.ccba.org.cn/Tour/TourIndex.aspx?tourid=255  for the tournament website in Chinese Simplified; use Google for translation|pg||
nt|h_karluk: he who finds @d Q would bring a good score, anyways prospects are bleak|pg||
nt|gracelin: If Fu is in 3NT here, he might run DJ first and it's up to East to duck this.  Otherwise declarer has chances in 3NT.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: despite some reservations about having the time needed to develop tricks with those slow honors +1 good score|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: i must admit i did not think of this bid|pg||
nt|cascade: not sure i like it|pg||
nt|babs59: Zone 6 is what I'd tend to call 'south-east Asia'|pg||
nt|davidstern: N/S will have to avoid getting too high in spades here|pg||
nt|rodal f: No much meat at NS here. Even @C is of 4-1 = 35.5%|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sybarra: nice 4 @S for n/s here|pg||
nt|henryb:  hard for N-S to get to @c|pg||
nt|h_karluk: could be|pg||
nt|wygbe1: possible grand to bid here for ew|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: 5@H + 5 minor|pg||
nt|henryb:  not so hard, I guess|pg||
nt|pelu: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: pass or correct i think|pg||
nt|gracelin: tks. It has been along time :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i exect pass|pg||
nt|brgpro: even if he ducks, declarer can switch to @c...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: *expected|pg||
nt|brolucius: When you have to guess whether the lead is a singleton or a doubleton (and therefore whether you should hold up your ace), it is usually better to play it as a singleton. Firstly, ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: because partner is more likely to lead a singleton than a doubleton, secondly because if you hold up declarer may be able to draw trumps anyway.|pg||
nt|marcsmith: too much bidding at both tables by jinging on that deal|pg||
mb|2N|nt|friggi: should be easy to reach|pg||
nt|cascade: but NZers like to preempt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=11-15 HCP, 3+@D|pg||
nt|sybarra: but didnt S have exact count on W hand  so @C play was auto?|pg||
nt|babs59: in politically correct terms - Pacific Asia Bridge Federation :)|pg||
nt|kaz08833: what's the point is if EW can make 4@h|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: worried about time left|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: brave|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Except for one 2@S by EW on board 24, all contracts have failed.|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: here the 2-opening-style worked perfect|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Australia (3rd) are about 35 VPs ahead of NZ (6th) here in the Open competition.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: liu had a tough hand, but this is not an attempt to solve it|pg||
nt|tejjyid: IF you take too long to pass here you make it hard for partner to reopen|pg||
nt|tejjyid: plusthe @S Q is unattractive|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: they all love their hands|pg||
mb|3S|nt|sybarra: I dont play 3/2 well with no high cards LOL|pg||
nt|cascade: Stout is on the way to 4@s|pg||
nt|janm: 2@h is 5 hearts and a 4+ minor, I guess - I confess I wouldn't have made this one |pg||
nt|janm: Hopefully 3@d showed both diamonds and a minimum|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N would have been 13-15 unless partnership doesn't allow 5422|pg||
nt|babs59: in 2011 the PABF will be held in Macau|pg||
nt|fabsayc: oh, i thought he passed|pg||
nt|brgpro: of course W wont find @h lead i mean|pg||
mb|p|nt|cascade: 5-4-2-2 equal minimum - you have to have some standards|pg||
nt|henryb:  although 2@s would certainly work out just fine as a contract|pg||
nt|pelu: @c-lead - normal here - dont work - there are 5 @S-tricks|pg||
mb|4C!|nt|cascade: that is what is commonly played|pg||
nt|cascade: 3@c/@d = minimums|pg||
nt|janm: Now is 3@s forcing?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not to me|pg||
nt|cascade: and 3@h/@s = maximums with @c/@d respectively|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but then i dont open this crap|pg||
nt|cascade: lets hope not and they have discussed it|pg||
nt|janm: So Miller has shown a minimum, will he decide it's good enough to raise if 3@s isn't forcing?|pg||
nt|cascade: he does have an ace and a fit|pg||
nt|babs59: I have a suspicion that both Zone 6 and Zone 7 will use it for selection purposes for the World Championships|pg||
nt|gracelin: south may not be finished yet.|pg||
nt|brgpro: so he has a good chance of making this|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The play should be quick for a push|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: oops operator |pg||
nt|pelu: now Liu would have prefer to bid 2@s first time - but that risk pass round - do he had to X first|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: he did think|pg||
nt|brgpro: i would bid 1@s...treat this hand as 8+|pg||
mb|4D|an| |nt|vugraphzkt: sorry a bit sleepy after lunch :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: interesting @s7|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, indeed, so I also bet Fu to make this|pg||
nt|h_karluk: most people prefer 3rd or 4th|pg||
nt|brgpro: 2nd 4th|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  chance for shift|pg||
nt|gracelin: Fu gives East a chance to shift to the damaging Heart|pg||
nt|brgpro: std lead against NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: Probably N could have bid 3@s over 2@h to invite in spades, so maybe this should be forcing|pg||
nt|sybarra: I know I do not play their system since that is not a neg X for m |pg||
nt|sybarra: for mi|pg||
nt|rv: Double of 2@c by West is t/o and need not have extras|pg||
nt|pelu: 480|pg||
nt|marcsmith: yes boring|pg||
mb|4N!|nt|sybarra: need some coffee or tea |pg||
nt|janm: The 2@h bid did keep EW from getting to too many hearts :)|pg||
nt|cascade: there are lots of ways to bid spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Shirley -- you mean Hou's DBL?|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes I would not X with that hand |pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, indeed. Takes the pressure off the subsequent bidding.|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: many experts play this treatment below 2M level after 1M-1N-(2X by opps)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: generally, of course, thinking is a good idea|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ambitious X|pg||
nt|jcwla: Seems like W had given full voice to hand already.|pg||
nt|gracelin: Obviously, west cannot double 3S for T/O, which East will pass.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: umm, interchange NS hands and join the party|pg||
nt|ritong: difficult, after the overcall|pg||
nt|brgpro: he is thinking of passing or 3@d...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: pass obv|pg||
mb|5D!|nt|sybarra: (or a beer) |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: negative dbl with 4+@H -- what's wrong with that?|pg||
nt|rv: double above 2M level on 1M-1N-(2/3X by opps) is still t/o with extras (15+)|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: There are about 8 rounds left; it all finishes on Sunday afternoon (NZ time)|pg||
nt|pzpp: another successful contract is 3NT on board 26, with 3 overtricks:)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: yep-overlooked.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: or rather that was being played at the time of my observation:)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: the problem is @dA on the air|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Second from a bad 4-card suit|pg||
nt|h_karluk: remember, 4th seat|pg||
nt|brgpro: since pd didnt break the transfer, he doesnt see a good game. however, pd may not break it with Kxx or Axx|pg||
nt|brgpro: with that holding game will be very playable|pg||
mb|6C!|nt|cascade: Lau was undeterred by the hearts sitting over him|pg||
nt|janm: Now, can he make this? Or rather, will he? I'm sure he can double dummy|pg||
nt|jcwla: The one thing they didn't want to do was give up 450 - so instead 500.|pg||
nt|ritong: i think stayman then 2@s invitational with 5+@ss any shape is a good treatment|pg||
nt|brgpro: so passing looks a very conservative view to me|pg||
nt|brolucius: Obvious game-try when we were suggesting starting with a positive response. |pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: in OR - where NZ has a very strange system - they never found the @s-suit and they sold out to 5@c - NO X in board 10|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 1@H showed spades i believe|pg||
nt|fabsayc: on board 10 open room|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: that was helpful|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I can understand Hou Xu's double. He thinks the defence has a club ruff on this auction|pg||
nt|jcwla: 1NT over the double would generally show another high card.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They have not, but North has a natural club trick|pg||
nt|Walddk2: heart trick rather|pg||
nt|gracelin: south hoped the defender could cross ruff in the minors, he didn't expect EW bid to 4C on 3-3 fit.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: k|pg||
mb|6S|nt|Walddk2: Would lead fourth with an honour higher than the 10|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer is now home with a later spade finesse|pg||
nt|h_karluk: cover @dK:)|pg||
nt|brgpro: so 11 back...looks like a pinpang game:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|brgpro: one for you, one for me...|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: Or maybe he can't if E puts the diamond K up on a lead towards dummy |pg||
nt|cascade: i think he has to lose at least one trick in each suit|pg||
nt|sybarra: first off, it is only a 7 count,  pard never knows I have 5 hts.  and never knows to bid them |pg||
nt|rv: North should have surely competed to 3@c|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr. As a spec told me 1-4     4-1=28.3%|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: the problem was they had no idea whose hand it was|pg||
nt|fabsayc: a common problem when you open very light|pg||
nt|jcwla: One of reasons for 2@C to discourage pd as much as poss'l, give them room to say their peace and be done.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|friggi: do you agree?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can handle any minor suit rebid from partner too|pg||
nt|h_karluk: oh thanks Wang|pg||
mc|13|nt|gracelin: but Hengsha leads most of the time.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The Chinese are very good at ping-pong, aka table tennis|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Although it must have been a shock that the women lost in the WC final|pg||
nt|brgpro: they lost to other chinese girls|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i was 2nd at pingong when i was in lycee, and one day i saw a chinese trainer video, that day i quit:) omg it was amazing|pg||
nt|h_karluk: in practice West expected to play low with a poker face|pg||
nt|gracelin: Jack, tell Fu overtricks do not affect imps on this one and claim.|pg||
nt|brgpro: i will text message him!|pg||
nt|brgpro: but he is not on tank, W is!|pg||

mb|2C|nt|ritong: maybe they have an agreement i shows 7+ solid minor and out|pg||

mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4D!|nt|ritong: wimp:)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: draw trumps, pitch @s loser and guess @h well|pg||
nt|andreasw:  offcourse*|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabog:  2 NT = 0-2 spades, max. 4 hearts|pg||
nt|fabog:  3 @D is passable|pg||
mb|4N!|nt|sundiszno: this looks makeable to me...|pg||
nt|xenya: onlty a club lead beats 3N it seems|pg||
nt|fabog:  hard to find the club opening lead with South's hand and this bidding sequence|pg||
nt|xenya: now it is makeable|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Peter BARCZY is much experienced, 90 Neumunster Juniors, 99 Malta open teams, and 2008 Beijing China Open teams|pg||
nt|h_karluk: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: that doesn't mean, however, that it will be made -- in fact, i doubt that  |pg||
mb|5D|an| |mb|p|nt|sundiszno: you'll make 4 diamonds, 2 hearts, one spade for sure|pg||
mb|5N!|nt|ahollan1: Asbi forgot the 3@H bid|pg||
nt|ritong: not really|pg||
nt|ritong: he s in 5, cold|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: [sarcasm]|pg||
nt|vugraphzkr: All at table having a laugh about the 10@D|pg||
nt|sundiszno: 3 harts now|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|nt|pelu: In B oard 9  EW bid and maded 3NT - @D-lead - decl set up 8 tricks by playing @Ss and in the end S jad problem a discarded a @H from Jxxx with AKQ10 in dummy|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|h9|mc|13|nt|xenya: maybe i'm wrong -- i thought declarer would play a @S to the 9 at some point -- now i'm not so sure |pg||

nt|rodal f: @H at top.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: still all smiling|pg||
nt|rnmalik: They dont have any choice:)|pg||
nt|pzpp: EW has a @h game here, but on a non @d lead, they have 13 tricks|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I can spel, I just can't type|pg||
nt|Walddk2: How?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Must you not always lose 1 heart, 1 diamond and 2 clubs?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: play a @d to table|pg||
nt|brgpro: NS can make 6@h but i dont think anyone will bid it|pg||
nt|brolucius: To overbid would be (perhaps) to force to game. To make a game-try is to bid down the middle.|pg||
nt|wygbe1: e was looking for third round club control - w doesnt have that, but has pitch for the third club, which is enough - tough |pg||
nt|xenya: probably 6@C asked about some club control in clubs -- there was none, so stopping in 6 is quite reasonable from E's perspective|pg||
mb|1N|nt|janm: DBL or 1@h with the N hand?|pg||
nt|barnets: 6-8 weeks from end feb|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the ill bid and fated 3N brings a welcom 7 to Japan|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the north hand on 11 could justify since attempt to deceive, as with a 2nt response|pg||
nt|jcwla: The @S ruff went bye bye - meanwhile 24 a push at 4@SX making.|pg||
nt|ritong: visibly you do not like my stayman gimmick  pity:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: I'm a 1@h bidder, but I can see the appeal of DBL|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=ART, STR, F1, (good 13)14+ HCP unbal, 15+ HCP BAL [16+ BAL unfav]|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: yes there are screens and was not a long think|pg||
nt|jcwla: 31 straight for the leaders.|pg||
nt|gracelin: Hi Jim and Vlad.|pg||
mb|2C|nt|sybarra: its the nebulous 1 @D in the precision system |pg||
nt|cascade: me too|pg||
nt|barnets: sorry|pg||
nt|babs59: np :)|pg||
nt|rv: some form of Bergen raise by Peter here?|pg||
nt|babs59: yes|pg||
nt|npcjpn: pass, double or 2@c?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: agree-@D lead difficult but not impossible.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 26 hc, rare but elegant @h slam|pg||
nt|brgpro: i meant, i think they play 14-16 NT, thus, rebid of 1NT=17-19|pg||
nt|marcsmith: nice to watch at a table where the game is played at a sensible speed|pg||
nt|wygbe1: hi patrick|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: P=0-9 or less than 3 controls|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 2@c+1@d, oh sorry, North's @h J9xx|pg||
nt|gracelin: so the 800 in other room are not a real disaster.|pg||
nt|marcsmith: i know i'm going to hate this 12NT rebid|pg||
mb|2S|nt|janm: I'd think Miller would want to bid 2@h to keep West from an easy 2@d bid; wonder why it took him so long?|pg||
nt|henryb:  5@d is certainly a reasonable contract: needs no @d loser or the club finesse and decent breaks|pg||
nt|babs59: Peter's bidding is very straight forward.  I managed to play a tournament with him last year - our first game together in more than 30 years!|pg||
nt|pelu: here a better overcall against 1@c - and in green|pg||
nt|h_karluk: btw QJ doubleton @d:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: i would x as south|pg||
nt|rv: I would have Xed from South hand|pg||
nt|babs59: we would all have doubled as South|pg||
nt|kaz08833: EW can make 4@h here but can they bid it?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: pass for me or 2c|pg||
nt|rodal f: But by 21NS = 19EW and open from EW.......|pg||
nt|pzpp: 2@d must be waiting, with 2@h as double negative|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  this overcall may help NS |pg||
nt|marcsmith: 1NT|pg||
mb|4S|nt|h_karluk: passed hand 2N?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: no offense intended, please do not misunderstand me, i do not think west's pass was kind of craven coward <my review, my opinion>|pg||
nt|marcsmith: fetch the bucket|pg||
mb|p|nt|friggi: 11-14|pg||
nt|alchilds: low =1|pg||
nt|sybarra: will be scramble but should be able to find 7 tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: playing clubs from the top |pg||
nt|friggi: yes low and play @C for 2-3|pg||
nt|sybarra: sometimes you just have to hope for the best|pg||
nt|friggi: if dec do so % is very much in his favour|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, W could be 6-3-2-2 |pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  but their best result is to double 4@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: Lui hesitated|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: Liu|pg||
nt|gracelin: in closed room West opened 2D to show both major, and East bid to the no-chance 4S game.|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwi_joker: 2H might be hearts and a minor, 3H now showing a "good" weak hand with hearts and clubs|pg||
nt|pzpp: now, 3@d transfers to @h, wrong place to play the @h contract for more than 11 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: deep think|pg||
nt|tejjyid: time for another coffee|pg||
nt|brgpro: i dont like X...why not 2@c? pd can bid any 2 level suit easily and, can support @C if ness.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|janm: 5@d is an awfully big bid! I know he has a stiff heart, but surely his partner knows it too, since he's heard the opponents bidding|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Jeff may duck a round of spades here|pg||
nt|rodal f: Should be a easy play.|pg||
nt|pelu: small @c will defeat|pg||
nt|rnmalik: oops-wrong sided.|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  2nt with fit|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 2@s would be my bid|pg||
nt|gracelin: 2NT is a good 4-card raise.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: cue promises goodish|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Patrick|pg||
nt|gracelin: looks ike a close match but both team missed the laydown grand slam on last one|pg||
nt|wygbe1: h guess needed to make this one|pg||
pc|dA|nt|fabsayc: 9 tricks|pg||
nt|fabsayc: with winning heart guess|pg||
nt|pelu: the the winning lead - for declarer :(|pg||
nt|pelu: I am glad I dont have do bid 1NT on the East hand - a naturel (F!) 2@c|pg||
nt|gracelin: declarer is bound to lose 3 more clubs here for the same -1 |pg||
nt|jcwla: Here a fun part of Precision - 4@S could be on wide variety of hands.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The club switch seems pretty obvious, but Hou does not even have to switch. The contract has no chance as Patrick pointed out|pg||
nt|brgpro: -3 imps anyway|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ahollan1: was just going to say  not sure if Puppet :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so picked passive defense|pg||
nt|brolucius: If this is going to go down in history as an entertaining and exciting session, the Great Dealer has only four more boards to get His finger out.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@H is not as straightforward as it may look at first glance when @DK is onside. There is an issue with the fourth spade|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|janm: And even though 2@c was in competition, it should show something, shouldn't it?|pg||
nt|cascade: considering he already stretched to 2@c|pg||
nt|ahollan1: operator alerted for me!!!|pg||
nt|barnets: and all gone minus in 4@C|pg||
nt|rv: inexperience/fatigue showing in Macau's game, it happens to all if you are playing long matches and superior opposition for the first time|pg||
nt|barnets: but thats not the point|pg||
nt|babs59: I feel more like Peng is remembering his 800 - which should have been put aside the moment it happened|pg||
nt|marcsmith: yes, need to play spades early before drawing trumps|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ahollan1: Thanks Amanda!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so no winning defense, both games depend on hearts|pg||
nt|pelu: but even on a small @C decl can have 9 tricks finding @HQ = 8 in Major|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, the safe route.  If south decided to switch to club, I thk he would have picked CJ.|pg||
nt|brgpro: 6 @h is not that bad contract after @s lead...|pg||
nt|marcsmith: win CA and duck a spade immediately|pg||
pc|h4|nt|vugraphzkt: np ... 1st time I knew what they were doing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @H9 might have been Rusinow -- promising @H10|pg||
nt|ahollan1: either way -- my $$$ on defense|pg||
nt|jcwla: No big deal here but sometimes the opps will have a quandary with a borderline hand -- you could be stealing, or have every bit of it and punish them if they go for it.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I always seem to get this wrong, which of the player names is the family name, Patrick?|pg||
nt|gracelin: Meckwell call it mixed strategy, you could bid 1S  4S with either Qxxxx  x  J10xxx  xx  or Q10x  Kxxx  AJx  Kxx.|pg||
nt|marcsmith: may be a problem if defenders lead clubs at every opportunity|pg||
nt|gracelin: depend on the H guess|pg||
nt|gracelin: slightly favot to finesse HJ, since north might lead one from Qxxx|pg||
nt|wygbe1: agree|pg||
nt|wygbe1: thats about all e has to go on|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|pelu: bad luck for W - but with @Ds 2-2 or 3-1 4@S X = 500-800|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think he thought about ducking might have been best |pg||
nt|ahollan1: @C will be very successful choice here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @CAce that is|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and actually -- then there are 9|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no @H duck because didn't want @S shift|pg||
nt|sybarra: well its the 5/3 suit |pg||
nt|tejjyid: some reason to downgade (singleton @H) - IMO offset by good intermediates|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: LOL ..and gets a reward with his 8 scoring!|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: oops|pg||
nt|pzpp: 5@h must deny control in @d, with which West will have a convenient cuebid|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: do i lead my ace ?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The 10th trick is funnily enough a ruff in the hand with 3334|pg||
nt|marcsmith: yes|pg||
nt|wygbe1: got it right|pg||
pc|d7|nt|rv: Macau is doing reasonably well, 8th place |pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: no|pg||
pc|d4|nt|cascade: perhaps 3@d was forcing|pg||
nt|rnmalik: sigh of relief.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: S not happy|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ahollan1: bravo|pg||
nt|marcsmith: that works too|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|kaz08833: to make 4@h E must play @s now but playing 3@h trump is reasonable|pg||
nt|marcsmith: club now|pg||
nt|peachy: Have a nice rest of the show, I must go, sorry.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thanks Raija|pg||
nt|marcsmith: cu|pg||
nt|peachy: Thanks Roland and Marc|pg||
nt|marcsmith: ty|pg||
nt|marcsmith: south needs to play a club to keep the defense in the game|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s3|nt|brgpro: needs 3-2 trumps and 4-2 @C only|pg||
pc|s6|nt|vugraphzkt: think|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|janm: Surely not? after the 2@h bid|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 5@D would have been a lot better opposite at least one club|pg||
nt|marcsmith: king?|pg||
pc|c5|nt|fabsayc: the winning heart play is both correct initially and on the bidding|pg||
pc|c3|nt|kiwibridge: Liu's 2@H was an underbid|pg||
nt|h_karluk: yes Patrick, really 3 Li surname at the table|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cA|pg||
pc|sA|nt|fabsayc: since it handles a 4-1 break|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s4|nt|kiwi_joker: If he's got 'count' in clubs from Tony, Sartaj should know to take this trick|pg||
nt|gracelin: The names appear first is their family names.  North Li, East another Li, West still another Li and south Hou :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: CR has finished up so welcome to those joining us from there.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Which is number one in China, Li perhaps? :)|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we almost missed it seeing all hands -- Peter Newell found the play single dummy AT THE TABLE|pg||
nt|babs59: they also defeated that 3NT that got thru at this table|pg||
nt|pelu: u are 100% correct - this time :)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|h_karluk: :)|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, mostly only rely on trumps to break.|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: thanks to our hosts  PABF [Pacific Asia Bridge Federation] and NZB [New Zealand Bridge]|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabog:  1 @S = no extra strength|pg||

nt|fabog:  maybe, if Hittmann continues to ask, but i dont think he will|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that's true, also 3@s has some transportation problem in practice|pg||

pc|d3|pc|d4|nt|xenya: and a lot of other things as well i suspect|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dQ|pg||

nt|janm: I don't think that really made|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: it did|pg||
nt|janm: How?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: to say Newell-Reid have had a good set is quite an underbid|pg||
nt|kaz08833: dbl then 2@s or 3@h shows E's hand precisely|pg||
nt|fabsayc: however declarer should have made an overtrick|pg||
nt|fabsayc: oh he did so low club saves the overtrick|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: that was lucky|pg||
nt|rnmalik: very lucky indeed.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Li is the 4th. Zhao the number 1 I am told|pg||
nt|marcsmith: but why you'd lead from that holding is not so clear|pg||
nt|Walddk2: How did 6@C make one may ask|pg||
nt|marcsmith: one way indeed|pg||
mb|2N|nt|fabsayc: possible if defense never lead trumps|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Or is it Wang?|pg||
nt|brgpro: this looks an easy 6@d for ew, esp. for precision players|pg||
mb|p|nt|alchilds: yes|pg||
nt|friggi: 2@S pass out|pg||
nt|cascade: the play showed declarer leading trumps|pg||
nt|pelu: in Board 8: taipei in 7@h - and lost @DQ - West had also open only 1@S - with a 4@S-opening more easy to find @DQ - but diff to bid 7 :)|pg||
nt|rv: traditionally Chinese Taipei and Indonesia were top teams in Zone 6, now it is very competitive with China, Japan etc making rapid strides in world bridge|pg||
nt|gracelin: Kebiya can still win the match if Hengsha fails to reach 6D here. |pg||
mb|3D|an| |nt|friggi: risky|pg||
nt|jcwla: That @ST would keep Lord Yarborough from having to pay off 1000-1.|pg||
nt|gracelin: No, Roland, the rank you mentioned is just a book of 100 names in which the order is listed.  Started with Zhao followed by Chien, Sun and Li.  Nothing to do with their popuarity.|pg||
nt|brgpro: well....after the favorite 2@h......|pg||
nt|brgpro: i mean beloved 2@h:) hope they will still love that after this hand!|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Q tripleton clubs and three little diamonds brothers, also opening leader|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@D=ART, 9-13 HCP, 4+@H, maybe longer @C/@D/@S|pg||
nt|rv: China is arguably the strongest team in whole of Asia (Zone 4-BFAME, 6-Far East) now|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: This is a real blind spot by Jeff... he should just have continued @Ds ..after that good fortune in the spade suit, he had 5@Ds, 3@Ss and a club for a certain 9|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|kiwibridge: 2 tricks in the play and 7 back to CT on 23|pg||
nt|fabsayc: good situation for transfer advances|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I see|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now I know|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: Well, apparently he somehow made it and now we get to see the Precision 2@c in action|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S=F1 , 4+@S|pg||

nt|barnets: multi 21D|pg||
nt|rv: some play lebensohl from North hand on 2@h by West|pg||
nt|barnets: south better not pass|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and we see them, 2@H a constructive spade raise|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: good pre-empt !|pg||
nt|h_karluk: http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=27067  Rui LI China|pg||
nt|h_karluk: the central question on this deal might be can N/S stay out of 4@s|pg||
nt|marcsmith: they managed to set up declarer's D8 for a heart discard|pg||
nt|marcsmith: absurd|pg||
mb|3N|nt|sybarra: and not wasted values here |pg||
nt|sybarra: well maybe the q of @D's|pg||
nt|friggi: right, freindly layout and lead as well|pg||
nt|cascade: a subdued Miller and Stout here should win back some IMPs|pg||
nt|jcwla: Finally, some pressure from N/S.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: however normal lead is @sK|pg||
nt|brgpro: 2nd hand 2@h shd be more discriptive, that is: it shd be 55, esp. vul.|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: Yes, surely he'll make at least 3 :)|pg||
nt|cascade: or rather too much aggression at the other table to wind up to 5@c|pg||
nt|sybarra: and we may play it here also |pg||
nt|Walddk2: If you count China only, Wang is number 1 several specs tell me|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The @DK and jack crashed at some point so @D8 became a winner|pg||
mb|4H|nt|barnets: now 4@H|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well maybe, could simply be a cue raise also|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: he should expect a @s bid after a X|pg||
nt|gracelin: Wang must have out ranked Chang in recent years.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Declarer cashed all his trumps|pg||
mb|p|nt|friggi: friendly|pg||

nt|pzpp: seems that NS plays negative free bid|pg||
nt|tejjyid: @D Q now, for fun|pg||
nt|gracelin: north found a good time to upgrade his 19 pts hand to open 2NT.  Make it easy to reach 4H.]|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: I like 4@H - 5@S|pg||
nt|pelu: best defense against 2@S is to lead @S4 - but in CR East - absolut normal - played @S A K 4 ( and stole his pds @SQ)|pg||
nt|gracelin: Jack, every team will win some prize money np matter the position they finish. So will you be entitled to share these prizes even if your name is not in te team ?  |pg||
nt|brgpro: why do they want to stay out of a cold game?|pg||
nt|brolucius: A good fit in the minors, as was an earlier board.|pg||
nt|marcsmith: they didn't have to crash tho - North overtook his partner's J with the K|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  6@s looks like a much better contract|pg||
nt|barnets: 6@S|pg||
nt|npcjpn: on this hand, NS can make 3NT, but no way to reach..|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3@D was different|pg||
nt|brgpro: i dont want to take their earnings...i could go but i didnt:)|pg||
nt|xenya: blame system here?|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ahollan1: 3@H confirming 5@H along the way to showing max 1N|pg||
nt|rv: yes good auction|pg||
nt|rv: is Peng's 4N quant here?|pg||
nt|xenya: might be tricky though -- especially on a spade lead|pg||
nt|wygbe1: friendly diamond position should bring this one home|pg||
pc|sA|nt|sybarra: hopefully no one leads trumps too soon |pg||
nt|janm: I think a 3@c rebid with the N hand was what pushed them too high - it just has too much in the short suits and too many quacks|pg||
nt|babs59: the other table started with North bidding 2@H - both majors, weak|pg||
nt|pelu: almost for first time EW stepped wrong - down 200/300|pg||
nt|tejjyid: the old surround play|pg||
nt|brgpro: no, but the definition of the convention shd be discussed more...|pg||
nt|marcsmith: and kept the D4|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ahollan1: in college we defined  Down 1 = Good Bridge|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yes -- i was enrolled in college   no - i didn't go to class as often as i went to bridge table|pg||
nt|sybarra: LOL  |pg||
nt|sybarra: but we made it thru right?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: after a mere 16 years|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but i made LM in decent time|pg||
nt|jcwla: Meanwhile, Chinese Taipei has cut the deficit by 10 by getting to the @D game on 26 - also making 7.|pg||
nt|gracelin: That's a pity, Jack.  Kebiya is due to win US$150 from this match :)|pg||
nt|brgpro: E shd never open 2@h in this position|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|rodal f: Normaly trumh would been the best lead, but E want W to lead that color.|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|rnmalik: sorry-some connection.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, he wasted the Curse (D9) at trick 1|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sybarra: some of us "dashed" thru faster than that,  but my father who often was nice enough to pick my up from school always knew where to find me |pg||
nt|rv: I suspect not though it could be for many other partnerships since fit is not found|pg||
nt|barnets: ok well done|pg||
nt|rv: as Barnet suggested, Peng should bid 4@h to show good @s fit, mild slam try|pg||
pc|c5|nt|rv: and his direct 4n should possibly be quant?|pg||
nt|marcsmith: let's see if NS can avoid flattening this one|pg||
nt|marcsmith: indeed|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|barnets: try and give a ruff|pg||
nt|ritong: this is a bit too precious for my taste|pg||
nt|Walddk2: @D9 is known as the Curse of Scotland|pg||
pc|s5|nt|barnets: looking at dummys diamonds|pg||
nt|marcsmith: indeed it is|pg||
nt|marcsmith: i used to play in a team where the rule was that you always had to play the D9 at the first legal opportunity|pg||
pc|s7|nt|henryb:  @h by E-W should work out well, but you had better correct that|pg||
nt|marcsmith: a trump is a much more sensible lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/ daf/i-p-c-s.org/faq/curse.php|pg||
pc|sT|nt|pelu: hi Amando undo - 61H by N|pg||
nt|pelu: Amanda|pg||
nt|brgpro: they have won their first match, although a small one 16:14:)|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|pelu: in OR West bid 3@d|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|marcsmith: and, of course, the D7 is the beer card|pg||
pc|hA|nt|barnets: only chance|pg||
nt|rv: as score stands with 1 deal to go, Aus winning match by 21-9|pg||
nt|rv: with only 5 VPs behind leaders Taipei before this round, this win could even more them to first place|pg||
nt|pelu: Yes as Martin say: @DQ is not unly fun - Its the way to pick up @Dj in S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is obviously dead on a normal defence, but you saw what happened in the other room|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|pg||
nt|pelu: Lead @DK to A and now @HA made the play easy|pg||
nt|henryb:  he may go down now|pg||
nt|gracelin: another pick-up for Xinyuan. But they also have a bad board waiting for them on board  14.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Meanwhile, back at the ranch Xinyuan will add to their load of IMPs here|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|tejjyid: would have been better with the @D 9 tho|pg||
nt|brgpro: i would jump to 4@s after 2@c response...|pg||
nt|marcsmith: well North should just keep throwing spades away|pg||
nt|marcsmith: so that South gets a count of that suit and can also throw them|pg||
pc|s9|nt|sybarra: (student union bridge and euche room)|pg||
nt|brolucius: If anyone had to bid more, it was South of course. He might well have done, with a possible good club fit. North was likely to hold a singleton in one of the red suits.|pg||
nt|marcsmith: thereafter it's not hard|pg||
pc|s3|nt|tejjyid: I think only 8tricks - 2D, 2@H & a @S|pg||
nt|tejjyid: the srround play looks good, but it eneded up simplifying the hand for declarer|pg||
nt|brgpro: after 2@h i would bid 3 only|pg||
nt|ritong: three aces, pard opens, let s go|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|henryb:  a lot, in fact|pg||
nt|pelu: need to finess in @s to make|pg||
nt|rodal f: Just follow the highway to the doubblescore|pg||
nt|wygbe1: ew can set up a second trump trick, so s needs to finesse d ten to make|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, has to play for the actual layout in diamonds |pg||
nt|gracelin: need the double finesse in D.  Li xin play for China in 2004 Team OLympiad and reached semi-final.|pg||
nt|gracelin: So I fully expect him to make this.|pg||
pc|hK|nt|sybarra: *euchre |pg||
pc|hT|nt|rv: sry 22-8 as score stands now|pg||
nt|barnets: declarer has no sure line|pg||
nt|rv: Check site http://www.qldbridge.com/director/downloads/WBF%20VP%20SCALE.pdf for WBF VP scale for diff boards|pg||
nt|barnets: thats what is taking so long|pg||
nt|marcsmith: well North has thrown one card from each suit instead of the obvious three spades that would have helped his partner|pg||
pc|h3|nt|pzpp: next hand|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|pelu: wd|pg||
pc|c8|nt|pelu: @SA - disc !J10 and !J to Q and A best play|pg||
nt|pelu: @h10 disc|pg||
nt|pelu: = down 200|pg||
nt|fabsayc: does it really gain anything|pg||
pc|c2|nt|henryb:  since he won't play West for two singletons|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i thought euchre only midwest|pg||
nt|marcsmith: if North just throws five spades on five rounds of trumps, South can work it out easily enough|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: and south|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am originially from midwest,  Nebraska |pg||
nt|ahollan1: ahhhh|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d3|nt|rv: a possible line could be to play for @ds 42 and @s breaking?|pg||
nt|rv: any other better line?|pg||
nt|pelu: then he will have the 7. on ruff with @CK|pg||
nt|brgpro: now a @c misguess will squeeze dummy!|pg||
pc|d6|nt|brgpro: N has to discard his last @h...|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|d2|nt|barnets: yes he could do|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|babs59: I'd have taken RV's line|pg||
nt|barnets: or a variance of what he is doing|pg||
nt|barnets: cash @SA|pg||
nt|barnets: now and @DQ|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: down 1 will fix|pg||
pc|dK|nt|pelu: No no no - not @HJ - just play on @Ss to East ruff|pg||
nt|barnets: if not he may run into a trump promotion|pg||
mc|10|nt|vugraphzkt: nicely played|pg||
nt|xenya: why shouldn't E open, Jack?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Did Cheng pay attention to the discards?|pg||
pg||
qx|c13|st||md|3SA97H76543D9542CJ,ST83H982DQJ3CT743,SK2HKQJDAKT6CK985,SQJ654HATD87CAQ62|sv|b|nt|ahollan1: this is final match of the 2010 PABF|pg||
nt|h_karluk: I think Gyorgy started to dominate the match|pg||
nt|xenya: the A of diamonds i meant|pg||
nt|h_karluk: uff, hard board, difficult hands|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Chinese Taipei have a 20 VP lead over 2nd place Australia -- max of 25 VPs available to winner|pg||
nt|h_karluk: why not slam now:)|pg||
nt|xenya: 4@H here is far more challenging than the 3@H in the other room|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and maybe the question would be slam @s or slam @d, 4/4 and 6/2 fits|pg||
mb|p|nt|andreasw:  3nt here needs @s to bare or @c Jxx |pg||
nt|andreasw:  brake*|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 6 off 2|pg||
mb|d|nt|h_karluk: as I said watch Gyorgy in action|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Or @CJ singleton or doubleton. 3NT is definitely where you want to be|pg||
nt|pelu: look at 6@c - need a @D-lead to defeat|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ahollan1: the other vugraph match is Youth U26  Australia leads by 1.33 VPs over Singapore|pg||
nt|h_karluk: +2|pg||
mb|2S|nt|h_karluk: i don't know what to lead vs 6@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: totals for Open online at http://www.nzbridgecongress.co.nz/pabf2010/Openxtab.html|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: i am afraid hard to stop with such gem|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ahollan1: http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/    lets you spy on all of the vugraph tables|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: still 3N very good as Roland pointed out|pg||
nt|pelu: sorry also a @s-lead will defeat :(:(:( - but who would lead a @S :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: now 7|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: any red, but which one to lead? both KQ, one short, one long|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ahollan1: curiously -- 6N is the only cold slam  because of the blockage in @S and Asbi's singleton @H|pg||
nt|geot: Hi all, welcome to the last match of the PABF teams, we will watch leaders Chinese Taipei vs. Indonesia|pg||
nt|h_karluk: good|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|nt|geot: Ok, so you have already said, Al:) he he....hi Al|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Patrick Huang [also spelled Hwang sometimes] has been playing top-level international bridge since 1969|pg||
nt|ahollan1: when the Chinese Precision Team hit the scene|pg||
pc|c5|nt|h_karluk: kind of dilemma, cant see a guarantee with hidden cards|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|Walddk4: Even if clubs had not come in for no loser, you would be desperately unlucky to go down in 3NT|pg||
nt|pelu: on a @D-lead u duck - and now a pressure on West|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c3|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|h_karluk: @c 9 i guess|pg||
nt|xenya: tapping S should get it 2 off|pg||
nt|h_karluk: seems 4 IMPs to NS|pg||
pc|sA|nt|xenya: E has to pitch a @S of course|pg||
nt|vugraphzmz: @H6 in hand|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s2|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|pc|hK|nt|ahollan1: i'm told Patrick was key member of Taiwan Teams for Far East Bridge Championships in ... 1958!!!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: he was 15 then -- you do the math :)|pg||
nt|geot: Was it in 1971 Taipei made their sensational effort in the Bermuda Bowl, introducing the Precision Club to the World?|pg||
nt|xenya: well maybe it was not all that obvious to E|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s9|nt|ahollan1: Geo -- that was the team, i just don't remember if 69/70/71|pg||
pc|sT|nt|h_karluk: no , 10 IMPs|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hT|pc|h3|pc|h8|pg||
pc|dA|nt|h_karluk: just off one|pg||
mc|9|nt|geot: 1969 a spec says. Acutally the book from C.C.Wei made me interested in bridge|pg||
nt|h_karluk: better to keep curse of scotland at the table|pg||
pg||

nt|friggi: 3NT in N/S|pg||
nt|janm: What were you saying about 8 card suits yesterday, Wayne?|pg||
nt|cascade: well there have been plenty of 8s and 9s the first two days|pg||
nt|fabsayc: they are occuring too often|pg||
nt|barnets: i think|pg||
nt|barnets: its close|pg||
nt|rv: Aus moving towards magic 25 VP mark, now leading 23-7 with wrong end of VP scale (1 more IMP to reach 24)|pg||
nt|barnets: after the wk two bid|pg||
nt|davidstern: Strange declarer is pitching diamonds which can be ruffed rather than clubs|pg||
nt|rodal f: Last board is up and last for me to.|pg||
nt|rodal f: THX spec. Was nice.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: last one all|pg||
nt|jcwla: Another good result for Indonesia here.|pg||
nt|jcwla: All those who said @HT would win last trick may pick up their prizes.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: oops, i dont believe CR was in slam|pg||
nt|gracelin: they are all slam-lovers|pg||
nt|brgpro: 2nd hand u shd be more careful, because the chance to pre-e pd has increeased to 50/50|pg||
nt|h_karluk: lots IMPs|pg||
nt|h_karluk: such as 12|pg||
nt|marcsmith: looks like a dull 4S|pg||
mb|1H|nt|janm: And what would you do with this one? Pass and hope to bid later? Open 1, or open a bunch?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: China on the board!|pg||
nt|sybarra: and our last bd of this set |pg||
nt|barnets: they like the multi|pg||
nt|barnets: so do I|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: last board to the match now, thanks very much to Nobuyuki and Kaz for their great comments, thz Amanda on the vugraph, great job, and thx all specs for your feedback|pg||
nt|npcjpn: thanks all.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: join us agin tomorrow|pg||
nt|kaz08833: thanks all too|pg||
nt|davidstern: 3NT N/S here|pg||
nt|rodal f: Thx to the exelent vug operator. Well done:)|pg||
nt|pelu: last board - 25 VP for Taipie|pg||
nt|marcsmith: 2N-3H-3S-3N-4S|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: thx to out wonderful operator,   great job as always |pg||
nt|alchilds: easy|pg||
nt|sybarra: and thx to Friggi, and Al,  and Frank and Pat, who were here earlier |pg||
nt|friggi: thx all|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: thank you. back in  a bit oveer 30 minutes- lets hope I am more awake then :)|pg||
nt|davidstern: But no easy road to get there|pg||
nt|gracelin: but East's 6D may succeed if south didn't lead a Heart.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: however in practice hard to defend|pg||
nt|h_karluk: now game is hot, 41-38 and last 3 boards|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  this board doesn't look like swing|pg||
nt|brolucius: After all, it was a fair game and partner had a dull 10-count. He would have passed 3@S on many 11-13 counts.|pg||
mb|1N|nt|sybarra: and of course great thx to our specs, for the helpful (and sometimes humorous comments |pg||
nt|janm: Lau chose the latter course (when I'm playing that 4 of a minor is natural, I love to be able to open it)|pg||
nt|davidstern: North will make a move and South has a max perhaps they will find it|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the real problem was a substandard neg double|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 3H nice warning|pg||
nt|gracelin: Precision 1C opening is vulnerable to high level preemptive, like here.|pg||
nt|brgpro: esp. when vul, u shd definitely have 55 i.e. ( u dont want to accept other suits)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|henryb:  another ambitious 3N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: remaining matches for the day are posted now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: next will be Open: Australia v China Macau   Senior: Indonesia v New Zealand (Cornell)|pg||
mb|3D|nt|janm: In the other room, East also opened 4@c but his partner judged to raise |pg||
nt|kaz08833: this one shd be push|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Thanks K1W1 great job.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: 2 matches tomorrow|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: thx :)|pg||
nt|pzpp: 2 matches tomorrow? I think that they have 3 left|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: thought there were only 2 could be wrong|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that may cost to 8 IMPs|pg||
nt|brgpro: anyone for 2@h?|pg||
nt|brgpro: from W?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They may have to start with a strong club here|pg||
mb|3S|nt|fabsayc: ah, the hand that needs the heart shift|pg||
nt|cascade: an interesting point is that I think that dealing programs need to have published their algorithms to allay suspicion|pg||
nt|ahollan1: guessing 2@C = weak @C + another|pg||
nt|davidstern: There you go|pg||
mb|3N|nt|henryb:  on 24HC with no particular source of tricks|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: still a few boards to be played and scored in the open room|pg||
nt|davidstern: So this should be 7 imps to Indonesia assuming 0-1-4-5|pg||
nt|davidstern: For ten tricks|pg||
nt|rodal f: A sac at 5@C but 5@H also on|pg||
nt|gracelin: Jack obviously prefer a disciplined 2nd hand preemptive, especially at Vul. which an old man like me surely agree. |pg||
nt|ritong: pard opens AND shows unbalanced|pg||
nt|h_karluk: now that 3@c then 3@s should influence|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2NT would have been something else apparently|pg||
nt|wygbe1: 6d makeable on non-club lead|pg||
mb|d|nt|fabsayc: overtake and heart seems right|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: i am booked to do 2 :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: incredible ap|pg||
nt|gracelin: I don't particularly like the 4H raise at this Vul.|pg||
mb|4H|nt|friggi: my guess was 3@C 3NT|pg||
nt|sybarra: quick shot of something then for you....(what ever that is) |pg||
nt|jcwla: 5 to Indonesia on 27 when Liu failed to lead A and a @S at T2 against 5@DX.|pg||
mb|4S|nt|alchilds: my too may go set|pg||
nt|janm: Yes, and maybe the spade 10 should suggest shifting to a heart?|pg||
nt|pelu: again the 1NT 6-12 created the problem|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Reid -- 1st DBL = PEN  2nd DBL = Takeout [i think]|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Dont understand, if cant x 3@C bid 3@S:)|pg||
nt|marcsmith: is it only in China that anyone actually plays Strong Club systems any more?|pg||
mb|d|nt|fabsayc: this event is really too long, we have to realize how long everybody has already been playing|pg||
nt|h_karluk: oops 3@h, 4@s|pg||
nt|brolucius: I prefer 2@S to 2@H with six cards in the major.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: however i doubt abt that cue|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: Guess not|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think any spade but ace is really wrong|pg||
nt|janm: Of course, they're not going to beat 4 whatever they do|pg||
nt|rodal f: Did Caledonia steel candy from the opps?:)|pg||
nt|jcwla: Me or your lying eyes?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: last board and some laughter here|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  oops|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and no double no trouble|pg||
nt|brgpro: i know many players would bid 2@H|pg||
nt|brolucius: Not much advantage in running the lead to your @SJ when you have those available tricks in clubs.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No, Bulgaria|pg||
mb|p|nt|friggi: needs @H play from Dec, diff to find|pg||
nt|sybarra: my guess is will play @D up from hand |pg||
nt|friggi: agree|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N was 13-15|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @S shift is killer|pg||
nt|sybarra: can China make a profit here?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  E is near to make it|pg||
nt|gracelin: no trouble even with doubvle this time.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: All top pairs in Bulgaria play Precision|pg||
nt|marcsmith: ah yes, that hotbed of top bridge :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  this one needs 3@c tricks, a reasonable shot, and either 4@h and 2@s or lots of spade tricks|pg||
nt|pelu: in normal system u would pass 2@S|pg||
nt|rv: this should make 9 tricks even with likley @s finesse|pg||
nt|marcsmith: sure there are a few top pairs|pg||
nt|marcsmith: some of the Italians too|pg||
pc|hA|nt|pelu: best lead|pg||
nt|henryb:  My stomach is growling, so I will leave you. Have fun, and thanks, Peter|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: long explanations|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: haha sorry |pg||
nt|h_karluk: almost|pg||
pc|h3|nt|rv: we are playing last board of this match|pg||
nt|gracelin: I see 10 tricks, no ?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i like this game|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  beleiving @s are 3-3 and @c K is well placed|pg||
pc|h8|nt|pelu: see u again - here it is bedtime almost 2 O'clock in night|pg||
nt|marcsmith: but most expert pairs have ditched it because it basically doesn't work|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|cascade: For those kibitzers who are interested in chess|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ahollan1: absolutely -- i was thinking best defense 300|pg||
nt|rodal f: 22-19 after this board. Then OR left to change the result|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This tournament is sponsored by Mr Xin Yuan, played at the newest and best bridge club in Beijing, Xin Yuan Bridge Club|pg||
nt|ritong: besides, you want to be in dummy|pg||
pc|h5|nt|rv: my thanks to excellent Vu graph operator and wonderful co-commentators Barnet Shenkin and Barbara Travis|pg||
nt|babs59: and thank you RV and Barnet, for not jinxing Australia too much|pg||
pc|h2|nt|fabsayc: no so maybe here a bit more excusable|pg||
nt|barnets: well tks all specs and fellow commentators I am retiring for the night |pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|cascade: Ker at the other table is a many time NZ Chess champion|pg||
nt|fabsayc: imagine playing a football match or basketball game every day for two weeks|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: agree|pg||
nt|h_karluk: likely +420|pg||
nt|wygbe1: good decision by south|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ritong: but it works|pg||
nt|brgpro: still need to guess @D|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes 95% likely to work.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|Walddk2: a complete round robin, every match you win there is 1000 yuan, ( 500 each if draw), and top 6 teams will have other money prize|pg||
nt|brgpro: W has bid too much, but justice isn't done here|pg||
nt|gracelin: when you have CQ in dummy, you don't really need CK to be on side :)|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dA|pg||
nt|rv: also a word of appreciation to Roland Wald who organises all these Vu graph broadcats and BBO management for telecasting it live|pg||
nt|rv: finally to all specs for listening to us patiently|pg||
pc|d6|nt|h_karluk: one of the strong actions is likely to attract a raise to 4@c|pg||
pc|d7|nt|cascade: about 8 or 9 times i have lost count|pg||
nt|jcwla: Thanks to our excellent operator, PABF, NBZ, all specs - it's been fun.|pg||
nt|jcwla: For now, from Los Angeles, so long.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: thx :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: good match|pg||
nt|jcwla: NZB even.|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: maybe 500 now|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: E could have got a ruff|pg||
nt|rnmalik: By play small @S-guts:)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: playing|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: no after Q@d|pg||
nt|pzpp: the double of 2NT normally shows interest in penalty on at least one of the minors contract, since he does not want to double 3@c, 3@s sounds much more reasonable than pass|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: they are all packing up here instead of playing|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: now E thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: motionless|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1000 yuan is about US$150|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: How did he lose more than two tricks?|pg||
nt|marcsmith: didn't think he did|pg||
nt|vugraphzsm: 4s +1|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ritong: guess south wanted to keep a chance to discard all the @ds|pg||
pc|s6|nt|janm: Interesting how many people are good at both games|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  indeed :-)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: in the masters club i doubt that 4@s would attract the most votes|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|fabsayc: there is a dealing program written by a norwegian|pg||
nt|fabsayc: which produces a lot of wild hands|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this looks like that program|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it is used by some of the dealing equipment|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so wherever the equipment goes|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and i am totally convinced the hands are not random|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the technical term is pseudo random|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but in a run of say a million hands it should converge on the theoretical odds |pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: romm will stay open unti scores are finalised|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @H10 would have been very trusting - an maybe worthy of write-up|pg||
nt|sybarra: interesting position now however |pg||
nt|ahollan1: @D best|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Chinese Taipei vs Japan  open |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Can't remember the other one|pg||
nt|babs59: Under 26 Australia v Japan|pg||
nt|Walddk4: One from the U21 I think|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Oh, thx|pg||
nt|babs59: and Open  Chinese Taipei v Japan|pg||
nt|babs59: U21 is what I WANT Roland :)|pg||

pc|hT|pg||
pc|d8|nt|rodal f: Sr. More|pg||
nt|rodal f: 27-19|pg||
nt|brolucius: East knew that the defenders needed two diamond tricks, so good defence to switch to a low diamond.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: off one in case @d back|pg||
nt|brgpro: what is W thinking of? playing a @s?|pg||
nt|brolucius: East's heart will be beating a little faster...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: drums beating|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer trying to look unworried.|pg||

pc|sA|nt|friggi: wd|pg||

nt|pelu: 3 matches a day (20 boards)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: a kiwi is explaining to me this event will end when the rain stops|pg||

nt|h_karluk: x-2 wld save 6 IMPs|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i don't believe that 8 cards @h fit couldn't revealed|pg||
nt|Walddk4: This is a hand where a prediction is very tough. Best would be for EW to stop in 3@C for example|pg||
nt|h_karluk: http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/ daf/i-p-c-s.org/faq/curse.php  The "Curse of Scotland"|pg||

nt|sundiszno: a short technical break here|pg||
nt|pelu: 1@H -pas - pas 1@s or 2@s?|pg||

nt|Walddk4: We have the full schedule up on our vugraph page now|pg||

nt|Walddk4: http://online.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php|pg||
nt|h_karluk: omg today June 08, 2010. lol, my apolgies to all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: May I suggest that you bookmark that site where all times are local to *you*. That will save me from lots of questions about where, when and what. Thank you|pg||

mb|1C|nt|fabog:  2 @C = majors under opening strength|pg||
nt|h_karluk: nice toy when both nonvul|pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: Nice slam in hearts here.|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|sundiszno: small @c lead?|pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: Perfect fit with with xxx opposite singelton diamond|pg||
nt|sundiszno: too small :)|pg||
mb|2N|nt|andreasw:  3@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: new suit from a non-passed hand sh be F1|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ahollan1: 2@S=ART STR Raise;|pg||
nt|h_karluk: however X could save the day, N obviously would find a chance to bid 2@d in case allowed|pg||
nt|xenya: doesn't help -- 8 top tricks|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|geot: If 3@D showed shortage they are on their way to slam|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|andreasw:  now this must be the final bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: we can only guess what Asbi's bids are - but I'm with Geo that 3@D probably like Jacoby 2N response showing shortness|pg||
mb|r|an| |mb|p|nt|andreasw:  S should have bid 2nt on 2@s?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: true, new suit nonpassed hand F1 yet not quashing in Modern Bridge|pg||
nt|pelu: so the pass from S just pushed NS on the 4-level|pg||
mb|4H|nt|h_karluk: ?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|geot: Well bid, whatever the bids meant:)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: what's going on there pls?|pg||
nt|andreasw:  should win|pg||
nt|pelu: how|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: indeed|pg||
pc|s2|nt|geot: Nothing to the play here...as long trumps are not 4-0. Soon claiming, I suspect|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Hung-Edgtton in 6@H for Australia U26|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sT|nt|andreasw:  east will be the only one to come in here so u just need to ruff 3@c|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|pc|hK|nt|andreasw:  and with only 1@d should win|pg||
nt|andreasw:  now will for sure win|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h3|pc|h8|nt|h_karluk: say pulled trumps, then where will you park 3 heart losers?|pg||
pc|h9|pg||

mc|11|pg||

nt|h_karluk: interesting another Xin Yuan is in USA, Department of Computer Science , Florida State University|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  but see th score|pg||
nt|h_karluk: however nicely done|pg||
nt|h_karluk: keener competition, as i said : "the table is hot" :)|pg||
nt|brgpro: u never know....i've played many honest guys( simple souls)|pg||
nt|brolucius: It was possible that West held the @DA (if he had down-valued the singleton @HK). But no particular reason to take that diamond guess.|pg||
nt|brgpro: i dont mind to be in 6@h here...will W find a @C?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|xenya: nice save in the CR|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  let's wait the course of auction|pg||
nt|h_karluk: say NS landed slam heart could it be easy to find killing @c lead?|pg||
nt|brgpro: good pass!|pg||
mb|1N|nt|xenya: or not?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: uh oh|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ok ty for undo:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, the code is 4SS+1|pg||
nt|gracelin: Huayuan is an all girls team.  East Yan Ru was on the winning team that won the 2009 Venice Cup in Sao Paulo|pg||
mb|d|nt|gracelin: looks like a push here and Xinyuan is safe for their US$150.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think you can beat 4@S|pg||
nt|brolucius: North has three options. Bid the spades, agree hearts immediately (2NT) or a splinter bid of 4@D.|pg||
mb|r|nt|xenya: yes|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i expect 4@s, anyways why not 5@d try|pg||
nt|gracelin: 3 rounds of Hearts may beat 4S, So 5D is a phantom.|pg||
nt|marcsmith: EW can't make anything here but will bid game|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C!|nt|brgpro: 2NT in china=GF bal hand, nothing to do with @h|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: I don't like the splinter really, because a slam may be there on power even when South does not have a particularly good fit in the diamond suit.|pg||
mb|2H|nt|Walddk2: Click on MOVIE and overwrite 4SS+1|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: guys, we all know table pressure. last 2 boards|pg||
mb|p|nt|gracelin: Xinyuan and Sanchen are sister clubs.  Xinyuan often enter domestic tournament under the name of Sanchen.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am told that all 10 teams are guaranteed some kind of money prize no matter where they finish|pg||
nt|jcwla: My kind of tournament.|pg||
nt|gracelin: yes, from RMB12,000 for ethe winner to RMB1,000 for 9th/10th.  Total prize money is RMB 100,000.|pg||
mb|p|pc|d8|nt|gracelin: Before this match, Shouchuang was 3rd and Huayuan 8th in this 10 teams competition.|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|brolucius: Yes, North had to bid again, to get his hand across, and then cue-bidding exposed the lack of a club control.|pg||
nt|marcsmith: getting to game on this type of hand is just one of the downsides of opening all sorts of garbage|pg||
nt|vugraphzsm: thanks|pg||
nt|marcsmith: but when you do, it's usually a flat board anyway|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thanks to Jack Zhao for all the info. Jack will be joining us for commentary in the next set in about 25 minutes|pg||
pc|cK|nt|marcsmith: hard to see how declarer can make any more than his six A-Ks|pg||
nt|marcsmith: 3H would be a splinter agreeing diamonds|pg||
pc|c8|nt|h_karluk: hmm, i may be wrong, either 2008 or 2009 i remember the Sanchen Cup on BBO Vugraph|pg||
nt|gracelin: Will West shift to his singleton club after 2-round of H?  He shouldn't do that.|pg||
nt|brgpro: he will play a @h|pg||
nt|gracelin: East shud give a signal asking for spade continuation rather than club shift.|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  I suppose, E should convinc partner to continue @h, but how?|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|pg||
nt|brgpro: next|pg||
pc|cA|pc|h2|nt|Walddk2: 35 mins rather|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 15 minutes to the hour|pg||
nt|brgpro: why ruff ?|pg||
pc|c6|nt|brgpro: looking at the A in dummy he wont do that...but the problem is the X on 1@h|pg||
nt|brgpro: @cJ is surely with W?|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|h_karluk: it's not hard to find a route to 4@s, the defense cannot lead the trumps|pg||
pc|h3|nt|gracelin: Every team will win a cash prize no matter what position they finish.  There os also small cash prize to winner of each match.|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hJ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|gracelin: according to the schedule, there is only a 5-minute break after each match.  But these players play fast and will normally finish earlier|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Must be wrong to switch to a club. If partner has a club trick, it won't disappear, and Cheng Zhe realised that|pg||
nt|gracelin: Cheng can see no hurry for a club shift.|pg||
pc|cT|nt|brgpro: i will never do ti at the table|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Board 16 is the last board of the match. Let me take this opportunity to thank our excellent (anonymous) operator in Beijing. Fine job!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Also thanks to my fellow commentators, Marc Smith and Raija Davis|pg||
nt|marcsmith: and thanks to the players for playing at a sensible speed (nice change LOL)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Finally, our gratitude to the CCBA for ensuring that this event is brought to BBO vugraph. As always, Mr Song Zhao has been instrumental in setting up a fine show, greatly ...|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: please stay with us, today's Vugraph is really wonderful|pg||
nt|brgpro: they play 14-16 NT, so will open 1@d|pg||
mb|1N|nt|gracelin: but if Sanchen can get another imps, it will  become 19:11, so the overtrick here counts.|pg||

nt|Walddk2: And to our excellent commentators, Patrick, Hamdi and Jordan|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: anytime sir, pleased to accompany:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|marcsmith: if East had transfered to spades, South might be able to double 2H for the lead, but most pairs who play regualrly against a weak NT use that double to show a strong hand, one that ...|pg||

nt|gracelin: D to J, D to K, then C7 putches H might be good.|pg||
nt|gracelin: pitches|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dQ|nt|gracelin: declarer has a chance to make this to reduce its deficit. a Good D guess is essential.|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|nt|marcsmith: surely South can see that simply overtaking and playing another high heart guarantees 4 tricks|pg||
pc|dK|nt|h_karluk: well seems 3@h might give an idea|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|brgpro: E is happy to see 3 more tricks in his own hand|pg||
pc|c7|nt|h_karluk: to decl|pg||
nt|marcsmith: that is totally South'a fault -- he could see that HA HQ beat contract so he left his partner on lead to make a disastrous switch|pg||
pc|c9|nt|h_karluk: Our sincere thanks to organizators, operators and fine commentary by fellows : Sveta, Jack and David. It was 12:30am EDT USA Thursday when my shift started, now 6:30am. Kibitzers ...|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  W shifted well, defence must not go wrong|pg||
pc|h2|nt|Walddk2: It actually does not matter|pg||
nt|marcsmith: not quite no|pg||

nt|gracelin: he heard me :)|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sT|nt|Walddk2: Thanks all, back in half an hour with a match from round 3|pg||
pc|s5|nt|gracelin: East was about to pass 2S until north bid 3H.  Even in balancing position I would not dream of bidding 3H with this north hand.|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|d8|pc|h6|pc|sK|nt|h_karluk: bye for now|pg||
nt|brgpro: ciao|pg||
nt|brolucius: Maybe 4@S was ambitious when the diamonds were known to be badly placed.|pg||
nt|brolucius: North's Q/Q/J in the side suits were known to be of little value.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Thanks for watching!|pg||
pc|d9|pg||

nt|h_karluk: 2nd @s hook|pg||
nt|pelu: uf decl had seen HL in H from S - then he sh know 3-3 - and best chance to play @H again|pg||
mb|p|nt|syl: what a stop here!|pg||
nt|fabog:  1@S 5+ spades, but not 5332 (5332s are opened with 1 @D or 1 NT)|pg||
nt|syl: hard to stay low|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|fabog:  pass can be any strength with spade shortness|pg||
nt|h_karluk: a tad strectched overcall, however not bad|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: once Steve Starkey of Pecs, Hungary, devised and developed on the principles of the Precision bidding system.|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|xenya: this might go for 500 if doubled|pg||
nt|andreasw:  a @h lead wouldand @d swithc would beat it?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: not sure Peter read it as Majors|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|andreasw:  a @h lead and @d switch|pg||

pc|c3|pc|c2|pc|c5|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|xenya: i thought E's pass implied spade shortness? |pg||
nt|andreasw:  beat*|pg||
pc|cK|nt|fabog:  either spade shortness or a very weak hand|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c8|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cT|pc|d5|pc|c4|pg||
nt|fabog:  but after bidding 2 @D and taking the trick with diamond J he can be 'very' weak|pg||
nt|fabog:  cannot|pg||
nt|xenya: but W knows E has at least AQJ|pg||
nt|xenya: yes|pg||
