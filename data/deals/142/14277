nt|henryb:  Hello All|pg||
nt|henryb:  back to 17|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|sybarra: this may be first ones to one nt |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@D=ART, 9-13 HCP, 4+@H, maybe longer @C/@D/@S|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome to Al Hollander|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sybarra: another set with the "fun" systems|pg||
nt|ahollan1: expect a LOT of alerts for NS system   Forcing 1@C, Transfer Openers [aka submarine]|pg||
nt|henryb:  Hello All|pg||
nt|henryb:  A partscore battle, with N-S aboe to make 4@c and E-W 2@s|pg||
nt|tejjyid: And this time, it's also probbaly the battle for 2ndplace as well|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hi all.|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  I would expect the auction to start P-P-1@s-some bid showing @h& a minor |pg||
nt|henryb:  wrond again|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=NF, ART, 8-11 HCP, 3@H  [maybe min, 4@H]|pg||
nt|sybarra: al,  are e/w playing precision? |pg||
nt|ahollan1: Shi-Hou are playing Precision -- i was just typing that Shirley :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: for those watching,  this will be a lot of artificial bidding,  |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hi everyone welcome|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: hi|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: both pairs at other table also playing Precision variant|pg||
nt|sybarra: only used with experienced partnerships and 400 pages of system notes|pg||
nt|henryb:  The Australian pair clearly do not play strong club|pg||
nt|rodal f: N for the first take out.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: ok maybe only 385 pages|pg||
nt|ahollan1: convention cards -- and some supplementary notes - online under http://www.pabf2010.co.nz/Participants/Convention-Cards/Open.aspx|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi all:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: might N sit?|pg||
nt|sybarra: or is he bidding  1 nt |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: this seems rather high|pg||
nt|rodal f: Teyssier was cold:)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|sybarra: must say I am not a fan of sitting at imps|pg||
nt|jcwla: D/K if this is the dummy N is expecting, but it's not enough.  This is down a couple.|pg||
pc|hT|nt|henryb:  clearly 1N was forcing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Reid's 2@D bid doesn't seem to fit the explanation I gave -- but i got if from their notes |pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: good morning all|pg||
pc|s2|nt|rv: Hi all, gm from sunny bangalore in South India|pg||
nt|rodal f: The web page for the turney: http://www.pabf2010.co.nz/|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Good morning|pg||
pc|s4|nt|rv: Hi Rodal|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|janm: EW will probably end in 4@s on this one, and should make it unless NS get 2 club ruffs - I guess 5@c is actually better, let's see if West will show his club support to get there|pg||
nt|janm: This auction might get them to 3NT, which would not be a success|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the Open Room starts play with board  29 -- so they will see results from us|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure who do bet on here,  defense if @H start I think|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|henryb:  the two-step probably shows constructive values|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mwigor: hi all|pg||
nt|barnets: looks like a save v 5@H|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ahollan1: we can only peek at their [and any other vugraph table] using http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/ |pg||
pc|dA|nt|henryb:  We do not have an auction, but at the other table West over reached to 4@s and caught a vey bad dummy|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Hyper-agressive bidding by the NZ  north-south in the other room propelled the auction very high, very quick|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 6@d in the 4-3 fit looks OK to me|pg||
nt|tejjyid: 6NT you can make with the right guesses as well|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: big think by Tony|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|janm: Perhaps if W bid 3@c here, E might retreat to 5@c, but West decided his suit was good enough to play in, and with the @h A lead, he'll be right, I think|pg||
nt|pelu: Hi all|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: this match is 1st China-Taipei vs 5th Japan|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dK|nt|tejjyid: The auction looks a bit murky, Nunn calrifies it for us|pg||
pc|d2|nt|kiwi_joker: ..and in the end they got the outcome they wanted (opps made the last mistake!)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: a passive @S lead & East will be very happy|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Thanks for coming...|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c6|pc|c8|nt|barnets: @DK|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|frankaus: g'day all|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|barnets: may have worked|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: likely 300 for NS -- i'd feel good bringing that score back to the table|pg||
nt|barnets: as if east had rufffed with the 9 dec would crash the spade honours|pg||
mc|8|nt|henryb:  Nasty breaks on this hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is the 1st of 12 matches for Round Robin  2 -- results aren't posted yet from RR1, but the rotation for RR2 is based upon final tally|pg||

nt|ahollan1: i should say if you RESPOND to 1@H|pg||
nt|geot: I@S, but really stuch if pd bids 2@D|pg||
nt|geot: stuck|pg||
nt|geot: I will pass 2@D in that case|pg||
nt|geot: But I would pass 1@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hehe    i was typing   "easiest to PASS"|pg||
nt|geot: yes:)....but if you bid on hands similar to this, I think bidding the major is the best. Might work even if partner bid 4@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but make @C2  @CK then it really is a problem|pg||
nt|fabog:  hi all|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hi all welcome aboard|pg||
nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|sundiszno: this is a practice match|pg||
nt|sundiszno: from Budapest, Hungary|pg||
nt|vugraphzmz: hi everyone|pg||
nt|sundiszno: the hungarian national team practices for oostende, and getting a challenger|pg||
nt|fabog:  Hittmann - Szonyi plays a special strong club relay system|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|xenya: hello Brigitta|pg||
nt|sundiszno: in fact, operator have been interchanged, so we have Daniel here|pg||
mb|p|an|alerted|nt|xenya: Daniel then|pg||
nt|sundiszno: and Arpad plays tzhe same system with them, so he is a specialist of EW-'s bidding system|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|xenya: why was E's pass alerted?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sundiszno: fabog, your answer, pls :)|pg||
nt|fabog:  Can be strong balanced, W has to reopen with double with 1.5+ defensive tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: oh i see, thanks|pg||
pc|h5|nt|sundiszno: NS playing precision, weak NT|pg||
nt|sundiszno: there is some money at stake, if the national team wins, they take it, if Gamax wins, they donate it to or junior team |pg||
nt|vugraphzmz: lead is 3rd/5th if there's at least a jack, if otherwise highest|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|pc|h3|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cT|nt|ahollan1: Asbi-Tobing play Cappelletti over 1@H-(DBL)    i have to admit, i don't remember what that means other than 2@C was NOT available as natural non-force|pg||
nt|geot: South tried 2@C at the other table, probably NF :).... but then North went to 4@H, naturally|pg||
nt|ritong: hi chaps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: bon jour Henri|pg||
nt|geot: Hi Henri|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c2|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ahollan1: Wu didn't really PASS|pg||
pc|c3|nt|geot: no|pg||
nt|xenya: with @CJ well placed and no ruff, 8 tricks should be easy |pg||
pc|cA|nt|h_karluk: I think Truscott is a nice defense to strong club and relay system|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hJ|nt|ahollan1: suspect 2@D|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||

nt|frankaus: just 3 here|pg||
nt|sybarra: -1 not the end of the world here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: missed opportunity, but any plus may be good on that board|pg||
nt|barnets: would hav been a nice try|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi RV:) And welcome. Long time ago.|pg||
nt|rodal f: A easy 3NT?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@H=11-15 HCP, a) 5+@H  b) 4441@D |pg||
mb|1C|nt|rv: this tourney is played in double round robin format with no subsequent play-offs|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: feel free anyone to commentate|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: can W stay in his seat |pg||
nt|sybarra: yes seems so |pg||
nt|sybarra: "stay in his seat" as in pass|pg||
mb|1S|nt|henryb:  6@h is a reasonable contract, needing 2-2 hearts or stiff queen|pg||
nt|henryb:  and no club ruff on lead|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Miller-Stout play precision.|pg||
nt|tejjyid: It's irrational, but I bet Nunn & Hans feel a warm fuzzy feeling inside after the good start|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: wow  last hand Chinese Taipei Juniors 4@C made 5 |pg||
mb|2S|nt|ahollan1: interesting choices for Shi over 2@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N, trap pass, 3@C [@H raise], 2@D all seem to have merit|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe tryingn to get the @D suit in before the ht raise |pg||
nt|henryb:  with various conventions of their own, such as this 3@d bid to show a gf raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: green V red usually a go signal :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes thought he might come in  but suit is a bit tacky |pg||
nt|sybarra: my guess is we are in game force sequence here|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: and protecting against opener having the 4441@D hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: Hou pulled out the 4 @s card then changed his mind|pg||
nt|tejjyid: BTW, anyone who wants to jump in and advise me I'm an idiot, do feel free|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: thinking|pg||
nt|jcwla: N's negative double showed the minors.  Now you see the problems with 2@S:|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: One, it gives the opponents two levels of room; two,|pg||
pc|h4|nt|kiwi_joker: Not sure about 4@H, as Miller still apparently had the K@S to cue|pg||
nt|henryb:  3N is probably a "serious slam try, while minor suit cues would be "courtesy"|pg||
nt|rv: yes cold, @h8 ensures a stopper and only 4-0 @d break offside can trouble this contract|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I'll feel like I'm back at the bridge table|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: the more the merrier|pg||
pc|h5|nt|frankaus: i expect this will fail|pg||
nt|janm: Looks as if NS can make about 3 hearts (maybe 4) and EW can make about 3 clubs.|pg||
nt|barnets: n/s have an easy partscore in clubs|pg||
nt|pelu: Basis system: NS: Precision @c and EW: 5 card major with weak and strong NT (green-red)|pg||
nt|jcwla: it now gives E something to think about when a huge chunk of the strength of E's hand is a @S void that's of no use in defense to 4@SX.|pg||
pc|h8|nt|sybarra: needs the spade lead,   should be -1 |pg||
nt|janm: Let's see if EW can get the spade ruff to beat this. If W leads a high club, E can overtake to lead a spade back|pg||
nt|janm: But on the trump lead I think NS are going to make 4 hearts|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@D is a mystery|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|tejjyid: what a nice system - pay in 8 card @D fit at 2 level |pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: no warm fuzzy things running around the table (yet)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|henryb:  I recently saw a study suggesting that with 4-3-3-3 opposite 4-4-3-2  you should not try for the 4-4 major suit fit|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Other room just started to bid Bd 18|pg||
nt|henryb:  Oh? I thought they went back to play 29 and 30|pg||
pc|s6|nt|frankaus: has a chance but its really tough|pg||
nt|rodal f: Safe for a try by 10 tricks now.|pg||
pc|s7|nt|rv: now 10 tricks possibly|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|sybarra: would have to magically read the club suit I think |pg||
nt|janm: So we've had two hands in a row where the best defence would be to take ruffs.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not sure if i would have been any better off with 3N|pg||
nt|sybarra: well it both sounds like they have an ace the DO NOT have |pg||
nt|barnets: i think south should x and north bid 3@C|pg||
nt|pelu: very nice contract if @Hs was running - or even 4-1|pg||
pc|c6|nt|sybarra: (imho)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|kiwibridge: E figures to be short so playing 9@S there would have been a decent shot|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Nobuyuki Hayashi|pg||
nt|tejjyid: probably a bit early for the warm fuzzy things|pg||
nt|jcwla: E has made the trusting decision and will be rewarded.  @H's E/W have three losers off the top.|pg||
pc|c7|nt|frankaus: now @C was req|pg||
nt|pelu: I see the point - but how do u know that ps has 4-4-3-2 :)?|pg||
nt|henryb:  I am however convinced that it is losing bridge in general to bid game with two balanced hands and 24 HCP|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Wang Zhi-ge|pg||
nt|tejjyid: they like to sleep in|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: :)|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Reid checks to see if 2 tricks is enough to beat 6@H|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sybarra: might he be concerned spade is cashing?|pg||
nt|npcjpn: Hello from Hamilton.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|sybarra: @H lead is bad idea now however |pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|sybarra: Reid might have also been checking backs of cards to see if they match |pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: N and E starting taking the bidding cards away before Reid had a chance to X|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm told neither NS player is known for being pessimisstic -- @SA not cashing would be way beyond that description|pg||
pc|d3|nt|janm: Of course S doesn't know for certain that the spade A is onside |pg||
nt|pzpp: E-W here just bid to an unlucky game in NT, with almost every card placed badly for them|pg||
pc|dT|nt|rodal f: ? 9 u have. By the @Shook u still have 9 if it loose.|pg||
nt|rv: Check this url http://www.nzbridgecongress.co.nz/pabf2010/Openxtab.html for all the latest standings|pg||
nt|pelu: now 8 - but "no way" to the 9. trick|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
nt|pelu: best play @D and try yo set up a squeeze against West|pg||
pc|hA|nt|pelu: Yes he dont want S in - but if he still not 9 tricks even with @SK right|pg||
pc|h6|nt|janm: My typing is slower than the players' play! So on to the next hand|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hi welcome Nobuyuki, you too Roland, good luck with your move to the UK|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ahollan1: anything but @Sx works  --  but i would have thought @SA and go to next hand|pg||

pc|c9|nt|sundiszno: EW playing a home-grown strong club-based relay system, fabog is the expert of that|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ahollan1: Chinese Taipei can lock up the win if they just lose by less than 39 imps|pg||
nt|geot: West in the CR also overcalled 2@H over a 1 spade opener, and ended up playing ag 4@Sx|pg||

nt|npcjpn: Ino won the senior teams in Bejing.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Nice to have RV here. All info comes:) Local time here is 0530 but free today:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: Of course now that 2@s has been alerted, it probably showed 5 spades and a 4 or 5 card minor, so wasn't even wrong on suit length, but I think it would be right to open it even if ...|pg||
nt|janm: it was just a weak 2|pg||

nt|frankaus: sys on  here is normal these days with X replacing 21C|pg||

mb|3N!|an|serious|nt|frankaus: olmost certainly its @H now that S trans to @S|pg||
nt|sybarra: and wrong colors to be stepping in with 3 @D |pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry with 3 @C I meant|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: I don't know what options he had to invite over the DBL (surely 3@s was not invitational). I think S is going to come to 10 tricks, and he'd probably have accepted most ...|pg||
nt|janm: invitations, with maximum values and good spots in both suits|pg||
nt|tejjyid: nothing very frightening about this contract, orindeed 4@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: yes|pg||
nt|jcwla: The stakes are raised here, though not into game.|pg||
mb|4H|nt|frankaus: looks to be a playable spot |pg||
nt|friggi: sure it does|pg||
nt|sybarra: actually 3 nt will work for e/w |pg||
nt|rv: my apologies for the delay, signing in from sunny Bangalore in South India|pg||
nt|barnets: i thnk north will lead a @H|pg||
nt|rv: after 6@d, can North consider an attacking lead?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: not much to the play here worst he can lose 3@S 1@D|pg||
nt|pzpp: yes, and the lead helps declarer ahead in the race for tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: same strat as the bidding in Board 1|pg||
nt|henryb:  2@d is apparently a transfer|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: now makes many|pg||
nt|npcjpn: 10 tricks, next board.|pg||
nt|henryb:  3@c is a non-standard rebid -- and since I do not have the CC handy, I cannot tell you what it shows|pg||
mb|4S|an|ace asking|nt|henryb:  but this time I think S whould bid 2N|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: welcome fridrik|pg||
nt|friggi: ty Frank|pg||
nt|ahollan1: did NS do well here or not?   only the shadow knows|pg||

mb|5H|mb|p|nt|sybarra: hi Fridrik :)  welcome|pg||
nt|friggi: Hi Syirley|pg||
nt|janm: Miller knows  that the DBL was a little light, so expects W to have only one spade, and takes the spade finesse|pg||
nt|sybarra: some kibber (or you Al)  I am still triying to figure out if e/w can handle 6 @D|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|frankaus: 5 imps to NS here|pg||
nt|barnets: dec has not spades from 6@D bid|pg||
nt|rv: if opps don't have source of tricks and just enough values it pays to passive, after 6@h there was a chance for North to consider @c lead|pg||
nt|rv: N-S are close to making 10 tricks in @h strain|pg||
pc|c2|nt|henryb:  ah. I misread the opening bid: a strong club, and 2N probably 11-13 with no 5 card major|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c8|nt|ahollan1: nah -- stop thinking about that when realize not biddable|pg||
pc|cA|pg||

pc|hK|nt|barnets: dummy did not check for majors|pg||
nt|rv: after 6@d|pg||

mb|1C!|nt|geot: setting trick as well....|pg||

mb|d!|nt|ahollan1: 1N= good 11-14|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wait for it Al|pg||
nt|fabog:  double = 4+ spades, can be weak distributional hand as well|pg||
mb|r!|nt|xenya: interesting defence|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|sundiszno: is it possible to find a bigger @d fit after E raises @ss?|pg||
nt|fabog:  if West says 3 diamonds, but i think in this vulnarability he will not|pg||
nt|xenya: W has a decent 6-carder, yet he prefers to show 9432 |pg||
nt|vugraphzmz: XX is 5 clubs and something else i couldn't hear|pg||
nt|fabog:  2 spades denies good hand|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ahollan1: DBL=14+ HCP|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Asbi PASS=Forcing [if Wu PASSES]|pg||
nt|h_karluk: xx like quasi-game force, sounds Tim Bourke relay based|pg||
mb|p|nt|sundiszno: is it obligatory to show a 4card @s suit, Árpád?|pg||
mb|3S!|mb|p|an|alerted|nt|fabog:  depend on distribution and vulnarability, not with 4333 or 4432|pg||
mb|4C!|nt|ahollan1: RDBL was forced by system|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: i checked, vernes' book was published in 1966|pg||
nt|sundiszno: polish double - means no better idea than a @s lead|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i guess they are on the way slam after 3@s cue|pg||
mb|4H|nt|geot: You cant play 1NTx with those methods, but occasionally 1NTxx|pg||
nt|geot: Wu reasonably did not want to defend the redoubled contract. Will Huang bid 2@D now, suggesting red suits? Or 2@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: one options = weak 1-suiter pulls the double immediately [via some mechanism]|pg||
nt|sundiszno: or polish pass indeed|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: vernes' book wasn't published in english -- but i believe a British author wrote a book based upon Verne|pg||
nt|h_karluk: to me S shld dictate, N described his intentions well|pg||
nt|sundiszno: they are off a keycard and the trump Q|pg||
nt|h_karluk: still 4@s might be good try|pg||
nt|xenya: S has lots of controls -- but does he know how strong N is, and, more important, that he has 4 cards in hearts? |pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think he knows : a) RD, b) 3@s cue|pg||
mb|5C|nt|ahollan1: i was going to ask if EW have discussed WEST runnouts -- obviously not|pg||
nt|xenya: his own hearts are quite weak |pg||
nt|h_karluk: and good news no @d control there, so obv on other suits decent hand|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, probably, Hamdi|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: 5@d last chance, tho hard to visualize|pg||
nt|xenya: now N is in awkward position perhaps -- what about the diamond control?|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: N knows 5@h safe|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|s9|nt|h_karluk: with double fit dictated|pg||

pc|sT|nt|ahollan1: so Wu's 2@C up-the-line scramble|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||

nt|friggi: ?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sybarra: this looks precision-ish |pg||
nt|frankaus: 3NT is likely here|pg||
nt|cascade: does this meet your standard for 2NT Jan?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: does not meet my standard, but i might do it anyway|pg||
mb|2D|nt|friggi: sure it is|pg||
nt|janm: I probably wouldn't do it vul, but it's certainly close - I can't imagine bidding anything except 2NT or P|pg||
nt|cascade: 3@c will be invitational with hearts|pg||
nt|janm: Presumably 3@c shows some sort of heart raise|pg||
nt|cascade: and Miller finds himself with a surprisingly good hand for all of the bidding so far|pg||
nt|janm: Everyone has different approaches to Unusual, but as far as I know everyone plays that the cue bids show partner's suit and the 4th suit (although some of us use one and some the ...|pg||
nt|janm: other for those meanings)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=ART, STR, F1, (good 13)14+ HCP unbal, 15+ HCP BAL|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: may be too hard to find|pg||
nt|rv: French Polynesia is doing a lot better than New Caledonia in this tourney|pg||
mb|2H|nt|cascade: yes there are various ways|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not sure about 4@C|pg||
nt|janm: Yes, especially with partner bidding 2NT vulnerable, Miller must wonder if his side has a game|pg||
nt|cascade: 3@c tied to hearts and 3@d tied to spades|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: a transfer over the transfer|pg||
nt|npcjpn: looks like Michaels.|pg||
mb|3C|nt|sybarra: and it is precision  (just not sure which variety) |pg||
nt|frankaus: communications wont be easy |pg||
nt|cascade: personally i play the lower cue agrees partner's suit and the higher is the other suit|pg||
nt|janm: As it is, it's pretty unlucky that 4@c goes down|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=FG, 8+ HCP, 5+@D|pg||
nt|npcjpn: dbl = 3-card support?|pg||
nt|henryb:  the black kings are well placed foe N-S|pg||
nt|pelu: 1@H = @s - and 7+|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3@H/@S available for EW.|pg||
nt|tejjyid: a vey SOUND 2@H|pg||
mb|4H|nt|pelu: Nt for NS = 12-15|pg||
mb|5D|nt|friggi: but np for 3NT|pg||
nt|fabsayc: that is not why i am not sure|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry wrong cc|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=FG, 10+ HCP, 3+ CNTRL [A=2, K=1], 1-suit, 6+@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H RELAY|pg||
nt|barnets: n/s have good save in 5@C|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 2nd suit or repeating the transfer?|pg||
nt|npcjpn: i bet second suit.|pg||
nt|jcwla: 3@H is preemptive.  2@C is truly moth-eaten on a quacky min and a 5-bagger.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 3@H=7@D 0@C 33  [or (23)80, 2290]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: just what Newell wanted to hear :(|pg||
nt|rodal f: Are those 15HP wourth 1NT?  Ok. I use to do the same:)|pg||
mb|6C|nt|friggi: transfer|pg||
nt|sybarra: the good news is E (or W) will have to lead something |pg||
nt|friggi: thne 3H then 3NT|pg||
nt|friggi: dbl tr|pg||
nt|frankaus: first 9 is on top then it gets difficult|pg||
nt|friggi: 3NT is cold|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it might get you way too high and also misdirect the lead|pg||
nt|henryb:  I do not agree with 3N: I think that should show tricks, and 2N should show 18-19 balanced|pg||
nt|henryb:  that assumes you open 1N with all balanced 15-17|pg||
nt|pelu: 1NT here is 6-10, so Why bid 2NT?|pg||
nt|henryb:  this is the only lead to beat 6N|pg||
nt|pelu: No they play 11-14 NT|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Newell has extra King for his 1st seat 1@C -- but can't imagine anything other than 3N now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N is discouraging, but since Reid unlimited it is not pure signoff|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Liu still has chance to splinter|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: EW have ended in 5@H on  18|pg||

nt|pelu: 6@s easy slam to make|pg||
nt|fabsayc: good afternoon from partly cloudy vancouver|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: nice of @D's to break |pg||
nt|barnets: but never bid|pg||
nt|barnets: only -200|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3@S0single and force til min 4@H|pg||
nt|rv: I might have opened 1@d and rebid 1n with north hand|pg||
mb|6D|nt|cascade: Jan tells me she plays the cues the exact opposite way to me|pg||
nt|cascade: the most important thing is that you have an agreement with your partner|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think 3c for hearts, 3d for spades is the most common|pg||
nt|janm: This time we have a game where the declaring side will need ruffs (diamonds) to make it, I think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@S asks controls   A=2 K=1|pg||
nt|rv: North could have chanced 3@c with enough distribution though suit is not good at these colors|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: slam chances looking rather slim|pg||
nt|npcjpn: yes, that's I am afraid of.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: he's done it|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Chung now has a Powerhouse|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: twin 50's on 18 to Japan for 3 imps|pg||
nt|npcjpn: 4@s, just splinter? or exclusion RKCB?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I hate the pass of 2NT here|pg||
mb|p|nt|cascade: and the defense have ruffs to beat it |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3N=3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so the hand with void gets to declare?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: contemplating 5@C opposite @SK and @HA?|pg||
nt|barnets: he also may have tried 3@C over 2@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: 2@h alerted|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: laughing :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: Although if he takes the club finesse he's been offered (right you are that the club bid got them off to the wrong lead), he can pitch the diamond losers and then just needs to ...|pg||
nt|janm: avoid a spade ruff (or S needs to figure things out and give his partner one, which may be hard)|pg||
nt|janm: So that will be a third hand that could have been defeated by a defensive ruff |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: if so then pass =3|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 9 for @H switch, is it?|pg||
pc|s7|nt|frankaus: a not so obvious @D lead/switch can couse lots of communications problems|pg||
nt|sybarra: club lead gets a bit messy |pg||
nt|rv: West opening is post-modern, I like his raise to 2@s with 3 card fit instead of 2@d|pg||
nt|pelu: Wellcome to Martin Johnson from Canada|pg||
mc|13|nt|friggi: no problem. play for @D 3-3 |pg||

nt|sundiszno: maybe only 4@h would have been better|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 3@C = jumping in after allowing opponents to exchange info|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i.e  why not 2@C over 1@D|pg||
nt|h_karluk: There are two generally acknowledged strengths of the strong club systems|pg||
nt|h_karluk: accuracy in uncontested slam-strength auctions, because the bidding starts at such a low level when opener has a fairly strong hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: or pass over 2@H|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and fact that all other opening bids have their strength capped by the strong club means more accurate judgment and scope for tactical operation both in constructive and ...|pg||

nt|frankaus: brb|pg||
nt|friggi: but N should never play@H|pg||
nt|sybarra: club lead was key for defense |pg||
nt|janm: very tricky hand, obviously, and difficult for declarer to realize that it was necessary to do the very unintuitive thing of stranding the club A in dummy|pg||
nt|henryb:  is that desirable?|pg||
nt|pelu: no but that their system|pg||

nt|rv: North's hand is close to an upgarde for 15-17 nt range|pg||
nt|barnets: north has a super max and 4@S will make|pg||

nt|henryb:  North's diamonds do not win the battle|pg||
nt|tejjyid: may be tough to decide though|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: what system for new zealand|pg||
nt|janm: Also hard for N to realize that he needed to play the second club to cut declarer's communications :) (I'm not sure why declarer had played the heart ten though - if he hadn't he'd ...|pg||
nt|janm: have been able to overtake the heart J)|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: 4@S by E has chances but the bad break should scuttle it|pg||

mb|p|nt|friggi: @C lead not enough|pg||
nt|sybarra: do you ever super accept with weaker nts?|pg||
nt|sybarra: I dont play them, so just asking |pg||
nt|ahollan1: i was just going to say that Newell COULD have bid 3@H as SSGT super-accept  [short suit game try]|pg||
nt|sybarra: for an older person such as me,  I would have to do too much "re-thnking" of system |pg||
nt|henryb:  Is 2@d a transfer or an amorphous force?|pg||
nt|rodal f: 4@S ok by 100% hit by the guesses. Might 3NT is better. But....|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3NT an easy make.|pg||

pc|h9|nt|janm: Can't tell from the auction, can we? 1@c was alerted, as was 1@d. I'd have said we still didn't know from the alert to 1@c, but probably now it was a strong club and negative ...|pg||
nt|janm: diamond - still not certain|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i am told precision|pg||
nt|janm: And what was 2@c by East?|pg||
nt|henryb:  West now emerges with 3N?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i started old -- thinking systems has helped me regress|pg||
nt|sybarra: One Kib suggested bidding  3@H over 2@H (4 crd support, xx in @H)|pg||
nt|barnets: so n/s miss a decent game patly as a rsult|pg||
nt|rv: South chose to pass 2@c and subsequently 2@h since he suspected misfit|pg||
nt|rv: at MPs, many of us would act with South hand|pg||
nt|barnets: cant see why south did not bid 2@S|pg||
pc|hT|nt|kiwi_joker: the latter i believe|pg||
nt|rv: not my choice for 2@c opening if it shows strong hand|pg||
nt|tejjyid: still, perhaps theywill explore for 6@D and stop in !5|pg||

pc|h7|pg||

pc|h6|pc|hQ|nt|janm: After a strong club and negative diamond, I'd have thought 2@c would be natural|pg||

pc|hJ|pg||
nt|sybarra: and another challenging hand |pg||
nt|sybarra: easier for us than at the table|pg||
nt|friggi: yes, sure it is|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: indeed, this won't make|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well i am just saying i dont play it forcing in this auction|pg||
pc|h8|nt|fabsayc: apparently natual is passe|pg||
nt|pelu: here pd had the cards he need: @S-stopper, help in @H and 3 card @d so the suit is running|pg||
nt|tejjyid: to Nunn, the @H & @C valuesall look wated|pg||
nt|tejjyid: wasted|pg||
nt|pelu: Its a real top-match, Australia no 2 and Indonesia No 3, Taipie No 1|pg||
pc|hA|nt|fabsayc: natural|pg||
nt|barnets: n/s have the balance of points and the spade suit|pg||
nt|npcjpn: at least undoubled:)|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I don't like a system where West can't show the @D support on this hand though|pg||
nt|pelu: results: http://www.nzbridgecongress.co.nz/pabf2010/Openxtab.html |pg||
pc|h2|nt|rv: good lead giving nothing away|pg||
nt|fabsayc: is one 10 in hearts from a decent game|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|friggi: that is nice:)|pg||
nt|janm: The bidding is more interesting than the play on this hand. It's out of our "ruffs to beat" set of hands, just a boring 10 top tricks, 3 losers |pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: no emotion shown !|pg||
nt|pzpp: facing 3NT, Lin had a big decision to make, his hand appears to be sourceful of tricks, just need a good @c suit and @s control to envisage slam|pg||
nt|pzpp: not sure of their agreement here, is 4NT just a general interest and natural invitation?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: ask about the 3@s bid|pg||
pc|c5|nt|sybarra: playing J to see if he can get accurate count |pg||
nt|pelu: yes missing @H10 not so bad - need a @c-lead to defeat|pg||
pc|c2|nt|pzpp: 3@s could be just a cuebid for @s stopper for NT purpose|pg||
nt|rnmalik: all cards badly placed, other than missing 2Aces, the Q@H.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: yes opps were asking|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c8|pg||
nt|friggi: this line is better the play for 3-3 @C|pg||
nt|friggi: then|pg||
nt|janm: I'm told that 2@c showed either diamonds or the Majors|pg||
nt|rv: declarer can still mis-guess all suits, generally trump lead is worthwhile if 1 hand is known to be very strong|pg||
nt|tejjyid: IMO, 3@D is mandatory aafter 2@S - assuming it's GF|pg||
pc|dA|nt|rv: if South doubles 2@C and subsequently bids 2@S it is likely to be forcing, passing 2@c and bidding 2@s should be NF|pg||
pc|d2|nt|rv: South took conservative route since he suspected misfit/bad breaks|pg||
pc|d3|nt|cascade: suction|pg||
nt|pelu: I play 2@S FG, and then 3@D id the obvius bid over 2NT|pg||
nt|tejjyid: me to|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|jcwla: Meanwhile, 17 and 18 have come in -- 17 just 2 to Indonesia for staying a level lower in @H's, but 18 the big one: 14 to Indonesia for 800 here and 100 in OR against 5@HX.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Those are the type of boards that decide IMPs matches.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: 10@s played in error, penalty card|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d6|nt|fabsayc: that has the unattractive name of suction|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right -- i think that's what I said Shirley -- but it is not obligatory [especially with min]|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|frankaus: g2g tu all|pg||
nt|pelu: @s3 is not the system card: 1. signal Low-High = even|pg||
pc|s4|nt|tejjyid: buti once played fit-showing jumps as well, so I couldstart with 2@H|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|tejjyid: That's a good method, but it doesn't happen often enough to take up a whole bid|pg||
pc|sK|nt|pelu: Taipei bid the slam and found their 6 trick against 3@H = 8 + 13 IMP|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|hK|nt|pzpp: to make the hand, declarer may have to take @h finesse to dispose his 1d duece|pg||
pc|d5|nt|pzpp: @d2|pg||

mb|2H!|nt|ahollan1: but here we're in context of precision  where 1@D=1+|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: and it seems to work well here, catching 4 card support|pg||
nt|geot: South has a huge hand, and in the CR he bid 5@C over 4@S in the second bidding round. No success.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: when i open 1@S -- partner's pointed suits are flip-flopped|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and after a losing @d Q hook, story over|pg||
nt|h_karluk: declarer finessed vs KQT@H at trick 1|pg||
mb|3N|nt|3for3: I'd start with 2@C then double later.  More flexible to END with double :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: not quite over, but close, yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: claro que si|pg||
nt|geot: 3@S pre-emptive. Huang hopes for an ace with partner, but anyway 4@S is ok.|pg||
mb|p|pc|h5|nt|xenya: he finessed the 10 |pg||
nt|sundiszno: no, playin the 9 is good against QT and KT, and bad against KQ with the opening leader|pg||
nt|xenya: that's what i mean -- 9 is the right card |pg||
nt|sundiszno: 1@d meant 4+ @hs, a kib asked|pg||
nt|h_karluk: lead M.U.D.|pg||
nt|xenya: same thing might happen here, in theory, but i don't think it will|pg||
nt|h_karluk: declarer have the luxury losing a @d |pg||
nt|sundiszno: if east getting the lead, and plays a small @h, what will you play?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|geot: same auction. Most likely push, but there are only three top losers. |pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|3for3: when declarer tries to draw trump, his heart ruff in the dummy disappears.  can still guess hearts for 1 loser though|pg||
nt|geot: I am counting one in trumps, not practical to solve that one....|pg||
nt|ahollan1: since this is public forum i don't think i'll admit i would NOT open 1@S|pg||
nt|ritong: mm...say you draw two trumps|pg||
nt|geot: We will win 5@C:) seeing all the cards.|pg||
nt|ritong: then a top @h|pg||
nt|ritong: after that, a @h to the 8 caters with all, seems|pg||
nt|ritong: but declarer might go for @h Qj bare|pg||
nt|geot: yes|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
nt|geot: which would have made him make the contract|pg||

nt|geot: ooops.....closer now|pg||
pc|d8|nt|geot: to solve trumps. Then he will solve hearts too|pg||
nt|fabog:  Yes, West's opening lead can be from Kxx|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ahollan1: digression:  in the U26 match  after 4 comparisons Australia 15  Singapore 4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they began the match with Austalia leading by 1.33 VPs|pg||

nt|3for3: One hurdle cleared|pg||
nt|ritong: home and dry now|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h6|pc|hK|pc|h9|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Huang known to be on minimum, so must be distributional for @S.  since Wu 3@S bid show 4, Asbi may actually be able to read  5161 or 5251|pg||
nt|geot: He will pull the trumps now, and then low heart from dummy. When the Q comes he is practically safe by playing a low to the nine. Unless West has played the ! from Q-9.......|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry -- Henri did already say that|pg||
nt|ritong: np|pg||
nt|ritong: always good to see we agree|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i have many acquaintances who would say that it is BAD to agree with me|pg||

nt|fabog:  Yes,|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hJ|pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: and relatives|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|dK|nt|geot: Playing the Q from Q-9 in this situation is the only defence to make declarer go wrong. If the nine comes he will bang down the other honor and concede only one heart. |pg||

nt|friggi: agree|pg||
nt|henryb:  4@s or 1?|pg||

nt|rv: have the rains stopped in South Island?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: bidding it more of a challenge now |pg||
nt|friggi: not good bid at all|pg||
nt|janm: New Zealand's IMPs came from board 2, where EW were allowed to play in 4@c and didn't make it (so that was a chance for a Hong Kong pickup if they'd gotten the spade ruff to beat ...|pg||
nt|janm: 4@h)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=ART, STR, F1, (good 13)14+ HCP unbal, 15+ HCP BAL|pg||

mb|p|nt|friggi: right|pg||
nt|henryb:  So did East: 4@d shows a good 4@s.|pg||
nt|pelu: also my bid - the hand is too weak to 4@D (namyats)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C takes them out of relay mode -- i think|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: meanwhile closed room seems to have gone to sleep|pg||
nt|tejjyid: Hans must have missorted his cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  I think Namyats should be a better hand than that|pg||
nt|pelu: CC: just a solid suit - but I agree with u|pg||
nt|pelu: and not "solid" :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  My rules (back when I played it) was no 3-loser suit, and not two suits with two fast losers|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or maybe DBL is relay -- i'm just not sure :(|pg||
nt|rv: at any other colors, West will gleefully doube 2@d, he is likely to bid 3n at these colors|pg||
nt|pelu: Grant like to bid - but he has no bid|pg||
mb|p|pc|sJ|nt|sybarra: is this a slam that is biddable?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it is very possible that 3@H=exact shape|pg||
nt|rodal f: The lead at match and team is? not @C but thrumph.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the all seasons double comes to his rescue|pg||
nt|pelu: a slow X = pd my distribution is not OK :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: now should pass|pg||
pc|sA|nt|vugraphzkt: nope :(|pg||
nt|pzpp: I think that Mr. Lin had a misunderstanding of this 3@c|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: thinking|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sybarra: 3 @D bid not recommended at home |pg||
nt|sybarra: or maybe only at home LOL|pg||
nt|friggi: agree|pg||
nt|friggi: helps W to count that hands|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe "we" are on our way |pg||
nt|ahollan1: so YES Shirley|pg||
nt|tejjyid: itsvery disciplined to take 2 passes on that hand; mabe he will balance over 3@H?|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|janm: 3@s presumably Smolen, showing a game force with 4 spades and 5 hearts, so that partner can play the hand in hearts; they know they don't have an 8 card fit in spades already|pg||
nt|fabsayc: what to lead|pg||
nt|janm: 3NT is going to be very difficult to make here|pg||
nt|rv: E-W playing negative doubles and forcing pass till 2n after double by West to set up forcing auction|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Kaz Yamada|pg||
nt|npcjpn: now the lead is very important.|pg||
nt|rodal f: How many have missed how many times there:)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|cascade: what do you lead from Miller's hand knowing that declarer is probably 4=3 in spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2 Key Cards + @HQ|pg||
nt|sybarra: but when I bid these,  hts are always 4/1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: lucky -- mine 5-0|pg||
nt|ahollan1: AND @S king offside|pg||
nt|kaz08833: hi all|pg||

pc|dA|nt|fabsayc: i might lead spades as the least destructive|pg||
pc|d2|pg||

nt|npcjpn: nice lead.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: another long think|pg||
nt|tejjyid: There's some serious underbidding going on here|pg||
pc|dK|nt|rv: East-West should time such defenses very well, need to combine punching declarer and remove his trumps|pg||
nt|barnets: if e/w tap dec he will make 4 @D tricks and a club|pg||
nt|pelu: why didn't S bid 3@D ?|pg||
nt|pelu: ven here its a make|pg||
pc|d4|nt|sybarra: pity the trumps dont break (just a joke) |pg||

nt|rodal f: But always 110EW|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|janm: Hard to know what to lead, I agree; although leading a 5 card suit is often right, when it's a bad suit and dummy has 4 of them... So I think he's probably right to try to find ...|pg||
nt|janm: partner's suit, just unlucky that he chose the wrong minor|pg||
nt|barnets: if they dont tap he makes 3@D tricks and 2 clubs|pg||
nt|rv: b|pg||
nt|rodal f: y better|pg||
nt|pelu: I am not sure I would have bid on the East-hand|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: this seems to need 3-2 trump and nothing awful in @S|pg||
nt|kaz08833: it will go down 3 at least if E misguesss d|pg||
pc|h4|nt|henryb:  He can make this, I think. @h to Q, @d|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so Great Shuffler on declarer's side this hand|pg||

pc|c4|pc|h7|pg||
nt|rodal f: @SJ and|pg||
nt|rv: strange play by both West and North|pg||
nt|rodal f: Might vug maded wrong at the @S. |pg||

nt|rodal f: But he/she will come with a correct result.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|gambit: cl already 6 or 7|pg||
nt|rv: min of 9 tricks for E-W|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: big think|pg||
pc|c5|nt|pelu: DD u can make 4@S by playing @D in trick 2 - but then u need to see all 52 cards|pg||
pc|c3|nt|fabsayc: if you can rely on double promising hearts he made the normal bid|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|cK|nt|sybarra: one sigh of relief so far |pg||
nt|pelu: NS's NT 1. and 2 : (11)12-14 - 3. and 4. : 14-17|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cJ|nt|rv: here even double dummy, South can't be stopped from making 5 tricks as rightly pointed by Barnet|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sybarra: hold breath now for spade |pg||
nt|ahollan1: NZ has won imps on every board so far -- this another likely swing|pg||
nt|sybarra: (that is spades breaking favorably) |pg||
nt|ahollan1: well -- wouldn't be surprised if swing, but 'likely' is an overbid|pg||
nt|sybarra: China seems to be pushing very hard at other table |pg||
pc|c7|pc|cQ|pc|d7|pg||
nt|janm: So 3NT will make - it was important to lead clubs, not to start setting up N's 5-card suit, but to take the entry out of dummy|pg||
nt|rv: now 4 down|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: should be -2 now|pg||
pc|s8|nt|fabsayc: it sort of shows hearts and clubs actually|pg||

nt|janm: I was wondering about that too - I don't see how he could have done that, but does declarer really have time to set up a club? Say he leads the club Q, now what? North has better ...|pg||
nt|janm: club spots than declarer|pg||
nt|sybarra: note the spade suit play |pg||
nt|rv: strong start by Aus pair in this room|pg||
nt|rv: series of good boards|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: and that won't be a great result for China either|pg||

nt|pelu: a kiwi surrender - never :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: grant said good choice of suit !|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Testing hands.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: good point Shirley -- must admit that i missed the safety play :(|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=3-10 HCP, 4+@S & 4+@C/@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: but defense does not have enough tricks then|pg||
nt|janm: Declarer has 2 spades, 2 hearts, 2 diamonds (if he uses the club and heart aces for diamond finesses), 1 club, he really can't find 2 more tricks, can he?|pg||
nt|rv: no one likes to finish last and lose too many matches, pride of every bridge player|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: not sure|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: nice 4@S for the NZers here (even 3NT makes)|pg||

nt|pelu: 4@D or 4@s by West?|pg||
nt|rv: I intend to drive to game in any case and in my opinion 2@h gives more flexibility|pg||

nt|pelu: 26 HCP |pg||
nt|jcwla: Nicely done by Liu with that @DT and score it up.  Meanwhile, 5 more to Indonesia as Chinese Taipei made 4@H in the OR but went for 800 in 5@CX here.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: anyone wanting to commentate please feel free|pg||
mb|2N|nt|ahollan1: hmmm will other room get to game after West open's strong 1@C?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: partner is a huge favorite for exactly two hearts|pg||
nt|rnmalik: another partial.|pg||
nt|tejjyid: not bad|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: 2@D = Multi|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3h is not my choice|pg||
nt|fabsayc: unless specifically agreed as a weak jump|pg||
nt|pelu: agree - bidding direct on Multi sh show a better hand|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|janm: I suppose there could be QJ in front of the K and A over it, but I don't think bidding scientifically will make it any easier for them to find that|pg||
nt|cascade: they have another chance to showcase their slam bidding|pg||
nt|pelu: see NSs problem after 4@s|pg||
nt|henryb:  somewhat difficult to get to 6@h-- maybe less difficult when West chooses not to open a large number of spades|pg||
nt|rodal f: Can blame the layout for EW at this board.|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: 12-13 tricks on @Dq|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: both directions have hands that fit together beautifully.|pg||
mb|3H|nt|janm: This time S has a positive response to 1@c|pg||
nt|janm: Can they find diamonds?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H=ART, 9-13 HCP, 4+@S, 0-3@H, maybe longer @C/@D|pg||
nt|kaz08833: its highly likely NS will play 2NT which will go down|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: N must pass surely|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: 3rd bidding box landed on the floor in this session|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: I like 4@s here, max pre-emptive effect and tough for NS to get in|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Looks like each side can make 11 tricks in their best fit|pg||
nt|pelu: here a very popular convention X pd pass if u have the suit - In my opinion the convention dont work well - u can never X for penalty if u have a good penalty pd|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: whimp|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: oops|pg||
nt|jcwla: Uh oh.|pg||
mb|4D|nt|janm: Or is 6@c okay too?|pg||
nt|cascade: do they need to|pg||
nt|henryb:  North MUST bid here; pass is not acceptable with that good a hand and heart support|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=ART, 5+@D|pg||
nt|barnets: not best|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: rescued|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@D usually 2/3@D but ....|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@h = 4+ HCP|pg||
mb|5C|an| |nt|sybarra: oh oh |pg||
nt|sybarra: but can W lead a @D easily|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 6c is better|pg||
nt|pelu: ok a bidding: 4@s P P 4NT - then 5@C (or 6@C) by N and 5/6@D by S = 2 siuter in red|pg||
nt|sybarra: may not be best spot|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Newell had option to bid 3@C showing MAX with longer @C|pg||
nt|barnets: Q|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: South's action is surely too timid though it is hardly clearcut to bid at 5 level|pg||
nt|barnets: would show  the @HA|pg||
mb|5H!|nt|cascade: anyway the answer was yes easily|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 6@D likely down if diamonds 4-1|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 6@C would still have chances|pg||
nt|kaz08833: with other Q N shd pass it's unfortunate judge by N|pg||
nt|rodal f: Auto @S hook and a 50% @D hook for 10in @S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: perhaps but they have bid my multi suit a few times, and i am still spending the winnings|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: the slam was NOT found so 13 well earned imps to CT|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: I kinda blame Stout a bit here .. he has chance to bid 3@C, which would have pushed pd's buttons (and they would never defend 5@Dx then)|pg||
nt|rv: I would pass 2@s with West hand, no Invite with 7 hcp, bid game only if partner super-accepts|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i was wondering how that 3@H bid would backfire|pg||
nt|pelu: in US and ? canada - the defense against Multi is not so commen as in Europe|pg||
mb|6D|nt|sybarra: might see china gain some imps here|pg||
nt|tejjyid: slams all make with @S Qx in North|pg||
nt|jcwla: You might say...|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: with the opening bid,  not easily |pg||
nt|ahollan1: that brings up point of extreme trivia - i was given URL that explains origin of "schneid"  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20061024124644AA8yaYF|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: I assume all of this was natural after 1@c and 1@d, and 3@s is some sort of attempt to find NT|pg||
nt|janm: 6NT won't be a success|pg||
nt|henryb:  Would North's pass be forcing? I do not think so. And North could have much less, say AKJxxx in clubs and out|pg||
nt|fabsayc: where do we locate BBO|pg||
nt|pelu: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: oh is this blackwood|pg||
nt|rodal f: At the -edge for W but...|pg||
pc|s3|nt|janm: Surely if N jumps to 6@c, S should let him play there |pg||
nt|fabsayc: i would have bid 4@C over 3nt|pg||
nt|janm: I think 4NT is just a quantitative slam try, not Blackwood|pg||
nt|fabsayc: club queen has to be a big card|pg||
nt|cascade: south did well to move with no aces|pg||
nt|janm: Yes, but S seems to be thinking along NT lines, also if he bid 4@c wouldn't that make it sound as if 3@s was a cue bid?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Took it out.|pg||
nt|rv: West should surely pass 3@s after his invite|pg||
nt|jcwla: Always max pressure from the Indonesian pair -- no free space -- a winning style.|pg||
pc|sK|nt|barnets: well done|pg||
nt|pelu: for sure Herr exp a better hand by partner|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i have to fight everytime to play it live, mostly recently last weekend|pg||
nt|tejjyid: if theat 4 HCP is 2 Q's, East can stop here|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|fabsayc: i liked the unscientific auction better|pg||
nt|janm: Of course, N has a minimum and a void in partner's suit, so even with that nice 6-card suit and 3 aces, it's not unreasonable for him to pass|pg||
nt|pelu: here in denmark even "the old ladies" play Multi :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the final ruling was the event strength of the weakest team was over 8000 master points so multi allowable|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i swear this is true|pg||
nt|fabsayc: as opposed to my usual embellishments|pg||
nt|pelu: I trust u - and here we find that atitude vert strange (mild expression :))|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: big think and sigh|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|cascade: Stout does have spade stoppers but the @sAK and the rest of his hand are also suitable for slam|pg||
nt|janm: This one wasn't really very scientific either :)|pg||
nt|rv: he has bid his hand to the hilt by showing 5@s and 8-9 hcp|pg||

nt|h_karluk: well i think opp teams would play modified truscott|pg||
nt|xenya: *knows|pg||
mb|5D!|nt|geot: I guess a 4@S opening will get many votes too. A practical bid. |pg||
mb|p|nt|fabog:  pass from W = i prefer playing instead of defence|pg||
nt|xenya: and 5@D?|pg||
nt|fabog:  3-suited hand with 3-4 controls and shortness in spades|pg||
nt|xenya: that's what he has indded |pg||
mb|5H|nt|ahollan1: notice DBL is NOT pure penalty as in previous millenium|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabog:  If W understood it right, he must have bid 6 diamonds|pg||
nt|xenya: W is not on the same wavelength?|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabog:  5 hearts is passable|pg||
nt|h_karluk: such as in Modified Truscott: 1 level bids are natural and weak single suiters,  X shows clubs, 1NT is clubs and hearts, 2C is clubs and diamonds,  2D is diamonds and hearts, 2H is ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hearts and spades, 2S is spades and clubs, 2NT is spades and diamonds    |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|xenya: he must have misunderstood the 5@D bid|pg||
nt|fabog:  yes, i think so|pg||

nt|geot: Declarer must not try to be clever in hearts....He does not know the nice lay-out|pg||
nt|ritong: north is supposed to hold 4@hs|pg||

nt|ahollan1: south is supposed to hold east's hand|pg||

nt|janm: The reason I think the strong club might hurt on this hand is more psychological than real - N starts out thinking he has a minimum and doesn't revise that idea|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the vague 3s and 4nt did them in|pg||
nt|janm: Another void opposite partner's long Major!|pg||
nt|cascade: he is minimum until he finds a fit|pg||
nt|cascade: then he has a very slam suitable hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: My guess is N/S feel good about their game, but not as good as it  will score up |pg||
nt|rodal f: So after the board: That was not as I would have done it. If E goes dow. And WD if home:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: internet connection a bit slow here|pg||
nt|tejjyid: so slam is at best 50%|pg||
mb|3S|nt|rv: on @d lead, declarer pitches a @h, draws a round of trumps and plays a @c out|pg||

nt|babs59: board 7 where Gill and Gosney missed game, OR  West opened 1S and passed partner's 1NT response (surely forcing?)|pg||
nt|babs59: so it was a flat board|pg||
nt|rv: declarer should have possibly cashed 4@cs instead of playing 3rd @d|pg||

nt|rodal f: If any are long at @H it's W. Play @H for the Q|pg||

nt|fabog:  lol|pg||
nt|h_karluk: lol|pg||
nt|sundiszno: seeing @cAKQxxx in his hand, is it a good idea?|pg||
nt|sundiszno: if there is not a club lead, you can strip the majors, and give south a @c, to lead away from @dK, as a kib suggests|pg||
nt|h_karluk: well, in my 1st club tournament tho i finished it with 58%, i passed my pertner's cue tho i agreed it as fit+gf, but that was 36 years ago, that 3NT would be quite friendly ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: neighbor defense|pg||
mb|4C!|nt|sundiszno: but it doesnt workk since North also cvan win the @c|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|fabog:  1 think 4 club means hearts|pg||
nt|fabog:  or simply asking for hearts, I am not sure|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 5@d fine, no way slam, unless @c lead there at trick 1|pg||
nt|xenya: hearts?? -- well yes, he has four of them... |pg||
nt|h_karluk: 4@h also saves the day|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S!|nt|h_karluk: passed p may be a deterrent factor to look for a slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|sundiszno: passed on 3@s|pg||
nt|h_karluk: however that 4@s might lead wrong|pg||
nt|h_karluk: showed extras|pg||
nt|fabog:  OK, so 4@C was asking bid, 4@H = 4-5 hearts, 4@S asking again|pg||
mb|4N!|mb|p|nt|fabog:  4NT = 5-card hearts|pg||
nt|h_karluk: csatlos did you play gambling 3N with Hittman?|pg||
nt|fabog:  yes|pg||
nt|h_karluk: then i think 4@c pass or pull|pg||
nt|xenya: i fear EW are going to have another misunderstanding but of course i'm not in a position to judge |pg||
nt|fabog:  but not in this situation|pg||
nt|sundiszno: 3NT is not gambling here|pg||
nt|h_karluk: quasi|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and i have no idea why 4@c not doubled|pg||

nt|jcwla: 22 and 23 pushes in 2@S making 3 and 3NT making 4, respectively.|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: how does this tourney work ?|pg||

mb|p|nt|friggi: agree|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Amanda, Henry, Peter|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yes @D preempt|pg||

nt|fabsayc: you did not accept|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: tight match so far|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: Well, he pushed them one higher, so I guess he was right|pg||
nt|fabsayc: maybe double|pg||
nt|barnets: do the top 8 play off or top 4?|pg||
nt|tejjyid: you can guess I play few partscores|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: But DBL should surely suggest some club length, shouldn't it?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2d suggests better diamonds|pg||
nt|fabsayc: double allows for 1nt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@D/@H are Transfer Preempts -- only 3@C is nat pre|pg||
nt|babs59: Paul Gosney has also qualified for the Australian Under 26 team - which meant that for NZ PABF he has been replaced in the team|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|janm: True, but I'm afraid the doubleton club would keep me from doubling - I think I'd end up being a chicken and passing - maybe bid 1NT?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 21 it was|pg||
nt|davidstern: They may have right sided this to avoid a heart lead|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ahollan1: on 25  China in 4@C|pg||
nt|sybarra: glaned at conv. cards, and were more than I could deal with at this time of night |pg||

nt|fabsayc: but since i dont drink coke, is ok|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I guess the lackof@C Q hurt them|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cK|nt|janm: However, pushing the opponents up a level was certainly a good thing, because it looks as if 2@s will be very difficult to make|pg||
nt|fabsayc: partner will only bid clubs with 5, then the support is adequate|pg||
nt|barnets: tks |pg||
nt|barnets: nick|pg||
nt|babs59: I understand that this year it's a double RR and then the leading team wins|pg||

pc|cA|nt|fabsayc: get a new partner jan :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: if i had say 2524 i would rebid 2c|pg||
nt|janm: Once upon a time, I doubled 1@d with 4441 (in that order). My partner waited until the 4 level to bid his 4 card club suit!! Taught me :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so i think here double suggests some diamond length|pg||
nt|janm: I would be more likely to DBL with 2524, and certainly with 1534, but I think you're convincing me to bid 1NT|pg||

pc|d5|pc|d6|nt|janm: Best now is for N to lead a club and get his ruff |pg||
nt|cascade: but a diamond works too|pg||
nt|cascade: since declarer also needs to ruff a club|pg||

nt|babs59: the Pacific Asia Bridge Federation is Zone 6|pg||

nt|fabsayc: oh, i thought he passed|pg||
mb|2D|nt|cascade: 5-4-2-2 equal minimum - you have to have some standards|pg||

nt|pelu: @c-lead - normal here - dont work - there are 5 @S-tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|cascade: that is what is commonly played|pg||
nt|cascade: 3@c/@d = minimums|pg||
nt|janm: Now is 3@s forcing?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not to me|pg||
nt|cascade: and 3@h/@s = maximums with @c/@d respectively|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but then i dont open this crap|pg||
nt|cascade: lets hope not and they have discussed it|pg||
nt|janm: So Miller has shown a minimum, will he decide it's good enough to raise if 3@s isn't forcing?|pg||
nt|cascade: he does have an ace and a fit|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzkt: sorry a bit sleepy after lunch :)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|janm: Probably N could have bid 3@s over 2@h to invite in spades, so maybe this should be forcing|pg||

mb|p|nt|sybarra: need some coffee or tea |pg||

nt|ahollan1: Shirley -- you mean Hou's DBL?|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes I would not X with that hand |pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: many experts play this treatment below 2M level after 1M-1N-(2X by opps)|pg||

mb|p|nt|sybarra: (or a beer) |pg||
pc|s6|nt|ahollan1: negative dbl with 4+@H -- what's wrong with that?|pg||

pc|s2|nt|pelu: in OR - where NZ has a very strange system - they never found the @s-suit and they sold out to 5@c - NO X in board 10|pg||

pc|c3|pc|c4|nt|janm: Or maybe he can't if E puts the diamond K up on a lead towards dummy |pg||
nt|cascade: i think he has to lose at least one trick in each suit|pg||
nt|sybarra: first off, it is only a 7 count,  pard never knows I have 5 hts.  and never knows to bid them |pg||
nt|rv: North should have surely competed to 3@c|pg||
nt|rodal f: Sr. As a spec told me 1-4     4-1=28.3%|pg||
pc|c9|nt|fabsayc: the problem was they had no idea whose hand it was|pg||
nt|fabsayc: a common problem when you open very light|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|friggi: do you agree?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can handle any minor suit rebid from partner too|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s3|nt|janm: Of course N doesn't know he has spade losers, so is just trying to lose a trick in each side suit and ruff the second club loser|pg||
nt|pelu: playing with screens I dont see that there were a "Break Of Tempo)|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s8|pg||
nt|cascade: Chan can Grosvenor now with the @s7|pg||
nt|pelu: EW signals: HL = odd Number|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree with that |pg||
pc|sA|nt|sybarra: declarer knows well that the club was singleton |pg||
nt|rv: North-South pair not very experienced and probably over-awed by occasion|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Bd 24 very costly to NZ - the dreaded double game swing, when NZ allowed Aus to play in 5C in the other room ..14 IMPs out|pg||
pc|sT|nt|friggi: has to play E for @DK|pg||
nt|alchilds: right pay |pg||

pc|c2|nt|sybarra: prefer playing neg free's here, but few folks do....that means under 8/9|pg||
nt|ahollan1: china in trouble again -- on previous hand where 4@H was down 1 --  China in 5@H|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cT|pc|h4|pg||
pc|hK|nt|janm: Those of us who wouldn't have opened 2@h with the S hand can now explain that it would have prevented our side from going down in 4@s|pg||
nt|sybarra: and I will say,  I do not strongly object to the neg X,  with single spade,  and the minor holdings   (just dont like the point count )|pg||
nt|ahollan1: get shape across -- let partner worry about points :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: Newell has 7@H on table as major pen card|pg||

nt|xenya: first imp to Gamax -- of course it would have been wrong to take any finesses on that hand  |pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: Gyorgy SZONYI long time no seen in international area, he was a junior in 1986, Budapest|pg||
nt|sundiszno: only 47 more needed|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|ahollan1: 3@H ASK stopper for NT|pg||
nt|3for3: Looks like par in the CR|pg||
nt|fabog:  1@D can be any 4333/4432/5332/4441 or 5+ minor unbalanced|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: and let black suits take care of themselves :)|pg||
nt|3for3: That doesn't feel like the right bid with that hand, but I understand the upside|pg||
nt|xenya: declarer could have tortured EW by playing out the clubs but decided not to -- well done|pg||
mb|1S!|nt|ritong: maybe they have an agreement i shows 7+ solid minor and out|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right Danny -- 2@D just doesn't seem like enough and 5@D too much?|pg||
nt|ritong: why not after all|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: well, you do need more than just a heart stopper|pg||
nt|ritong: if pard is aware, is no big deal|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|geot: 6@H makeable |pg||
nt|fabog:  1 @S = mild game invitational hand with any distribution|pg||
nt|fabog:  2 @D = 4/5 spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: when will that book be available ---  The Science of Bidding 8 & 9-card Suits|pg||
nt|ritong: as soon as written  might take some time, though|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i first mentioned it in college -- when i was supposed to be studying a different science|pg||
nt|3for3: are there enough entries to pick up the clubs?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Laszlo HITTMANN last played in 2009 4th EUROPEAN OPEN CHAMPIONSHIPS Sanremo 2009 - Open Pairs - Consolation with our fellow commentator FABOG (Arpad CSATLOS) :)  |pg||
mb|2N!|nt|geot: diamond lead take an entry to N early|pg||
nt|3for3: right|pg||
nt|geot: will get problems to bring in the clubs then, you are right.|pg||
nt|3for3: the 8 of clubs lives to stop the slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|geot: exactly|pg||
nt|3for3: in 6, west might underlead, and south would have to guess to duck it to his Ten!!|pg||
nt|geot: lol.....|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: wimp:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabog:  2 NT = 0-2 spades, max. 4 hearts|pg||
nt|fabog:  3 @D is passable|pg||
pc|hT|nt|sundiszno: this looks makeable to me...|pg||
nt|xenya: onlty a club lead beats 3N it seems|pg||
nt|fabog:  hard to find the club opening lead with South's hand and this bidding sequence|pg||
nt|xenya: now it is makeable|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Peter BARCZY is much experienced, 90 Neumunster Juniors, 99 Malta open teams, and 2008 Beijing China Open teams|pg||
pc|h4|nt|xenya: that doesn't mean, however, that it will be made -- in fact, i doubt that  |pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
nt|sundiszno: you'll make 4 diamonds, 2 hearts, one spade for sure|pg||

nt|rodal f: @H at top.|pg||

nt|rnmalik: They dont have any choice:)|pg||
nt|pzpp: EW has a @h game here, but on a non @d lead, they have 13 tricks|pg||
nt|tejjyid: I can spel, I just can't type|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|janm: DBL or 1@h with the N hand?|pg||
nt|barnets: 6-8 weeks from end feb|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the ill bid and fated 3N brings a welcom 7 to Japan|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the north hand on 11 could justify since attempt to deceive, as with a 2nt response|pg||
nt|jcwla: The @S ruff went bye bye - meanwhile 24 a push at 4@SX making.|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: I'm a 1@h bidder, but I can see the appeal of DBL|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=ART, STR, F1, (good 13)14+ HCP unbal, 15+ HCP BAL [16+ BAL unfav]|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: yes there are screens and was not a long think|pg||
mb|1H|nt|sybarra: its the nebulous 1 @D in the precision system |pg||
nt|cascade: me too|pg||
nt|barnets: sorry|pg||
nt|babs59: np :)|pg||
nt|rv: some form of Bergen raise by Peter here?|pg||
nt|babs59: yes|pg||
nt|npcjpn: pass, double or 2@c?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: agree-@D lead difficult but not impossible.|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: P=0-9 or less than 3 controls|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|janm: I'd think Miller would want to bid 2@h to keep West from an easy 2@d bid; wonder why it took him so long?|pg||
nt|henryb:  5@d is certainly a reasonable contract: needs no @d loser or the club finesse and decent breaks|pg||
nt|babs59: Peter's bidding is very straight forward.  I managed to play a tournament with him last year - our first game together in more than 30 years!|pg||
nt|pelu: here a better overcall against 1@c - and in green|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: i would x as south|pg||
nt|rv: I would have Xed from South hand|pg||
nt|babs59: we would all have doubled as South|pg||
nt|kaz08833: EW can make 4@h here but can they bid it?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: pass for me or 2c|pg||
nt|rodal f: But by 21NS = 19EW and open from EW.......|pg||
nt|pzpp: 2@d must be waiting, with 2@h as double negative|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|friggi: 11-14|pg||
nt|alchilds: low =1|pg||
nt|sybarra: will be scramble but should be able to find 7 tricks|pg||
nt|sybarra: playing clubs from the top |pg||
nt|friggi: yes low and play @C for 2-3|pg||
nt|sybarra: sometimes you just have to hope for the best|pg||
nt|friggi: if dec do so % is very much in his favour|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  but their best result is to double 4@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: Lui hesitated|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: Liu|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwi_joker: 2H might be hearts and a minor, 3H now showing a "good" weak hand with hearts and clubs|pg||
nt|pzpp: now, 3@d transfers to @h, wrong place to play the @h contract for more than 11 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: deep think|pg||
nt|tejjyid: time for another coffee|pg||
pc|s4|nt|janm: 5@d is an awfully big bid! I know he has a stiff heart, but surely his partner knows it too, since he's heard the opponents bidding|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Jeff may duck a round of spades here|pg||
nt|rodal f: Should be a easy play.|pg||
nt|pelu: small @c will defeat|pg||
nt|rnmalik: oops-wrong sided.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|fabsayc: 9 tricks|pg||
nt|fabsayc: with winning heart guess|pg||
nt|pelu: the the winning lead - for declarer :(|pg||
nt|pelu: I am glad I dont have do bid 1NT on the East hand - a naturel (F!) 2@c|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ahollan1: was just going to say  not sure if Puppet :)|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|janm: And even though 2@c was in competition, it should show something, shouldn't it?|pg||
nt|cascade: considering he already stretched to 2@c|pg||
nt|ahollan1: operator alerted for me!!!|pg||
nt|barnets: and all gone minus in 4@C|pg||
nt|rv: inexperience/fatigue showing in Macau's game, it happens to all if you are playing long matches and superior opposition for the first time|pg||
nt|barnets: but thats not the point|pg||
nt|babs59: I feel more like Peng is remembering his 800 - which should have been put aside the moment it happened|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ahollan1: Thanks Amanda!|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so no winning defense, both games depend on hearts|pg||
nt|pelu: but even on a small @C decl can have 9 tricks finding @HQ = 8 in Major|pg||
pc|h5|nt|vugraphzkt: np ... 1st time I knew what they were doing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @H9 might have been Rusinow -- promising @H10|pg||
nt|ahollan1: either way -- my $$$ on defense|pg||
pc|d2|nt|pelu: bad luck for W - but with @Ds 2-2 or 3-1 4@S X = 500-800|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think he thought about ducking might have been best |pg||
nt|ahollan1: @C will be very successful choice here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @CAce that is|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and actually -- then there are 9|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no @H duck because didn't want @S shift|pg||
nt|sybarra: well its the 5/3 suit |pg||
nt|tejjyid: some reason to downgade (singleton @H) - IMO offset by good intermediates|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: LOL ..and gets a reward with his 8 scoring!|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: oops|pg||
nt|pzpp: 5@h must deny control in @d, with which West will have a convenient cuebid|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: do i lead my ace ?|pg||
pc|s9|nt|rv: Macau is doing reasonably well, 8th place |pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: no|pg||
pc|s6|nt|cascade: perhaps 3@d was forcing|pg||
nt|rnmalik: sigh of relief.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: S not happy|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ahollan1: bravo|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|kaz08833: to make 4@h E must play @s now but playing 3@h trump is reasonable|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dT|pc|dK|nt|vugraphzkt: think|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|janm: Surely not? after the 2@h bid|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 5@D would have been a lot better opposite at least one club|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|fabsayc: the winning heart play is both correct initially and on the bidding|pg||
pc|c3|nt|kiwibridge: Liu's 2@H was an underbid|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c6|pg||
mc|11|nt|fabsayc: since it handles a 4-1 break|pg||

nt|vugraphzkt: it did|pg||
nt|janm: How?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: to say Newell-Reid have had a good set is quite an underbid|pg||
nt|kaz08833: dbl then 2@s or 3@h shows E's hand precisely|pg||
nt|fabsayc: however declarer should have made an overtrick|pg||
nt|fabsayc: oh he did so low club saves the overtrick|pg||

nt|rv: traditionally Chinese Taipei and Indonesia were top teams in Zone 6, now it is very competitive with China, Japan etc making rapid strides in world bridge|pg||
mb|3H|nt|friggi: risky|pg||

nt|rv: some play lebensohl from North hand on 2@h by West|pg||

nt|sybarra: well maybe the q of @D's|pg||

nt|jcwla: Finally, some pressure from N/S.|pg||
mb|p|nt|janm: Yes, surely he'll make at least 3 :)|pg||
nt|cascade: or rather too much aggression at the other table to wind up to 5@c|pg||
nt|sybarra: and we may play it here also |pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: now 4@H|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well maybe, could simply be a cue raise also|pg||

pc|hA|nt|friggi: friendly|pg||

nt|tejjyid: @D Q now, for fun|pg||
pc|s2|nt|barnets: I like 4@H - 5@S|pg||
nt|pelu: best defense against 2@S is to lead @S4 - but in CR East - absolut normal - played @S A K 4 ( and stole his pds @SQ)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|henryb:  6@s looks like a much better contract|pg||
nt|barnets: 6@S|pg||
nt|npcjpn: on this hand, NS can make 3NT, but no way to reach..|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3@D was different|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@H confirming 5@H along the way to showing max 1N|pg||
nt|rv: yes good auction|pg||
nt|rv: is Peng's 4N quant here?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|sybarra: hopefully no one leads trumps too soon |pg||
nt|janm: I think a 3@c rebid with the N hand was what pushed them too high - it just has too much in the short suits and too many quacks|pg||
nt|babs59: the other table started with North bidding 2@H - both majors, weak|pg||
nt|pelu: almost for first time EW stepped wrong - down 200/300|pg||
nt|tejjyid: the old surround play|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ahollan1: in college we defined  Down 1 = Good Bridge|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yes -- i was enrolled in college   no - i didn't go to class as often as i went to bridge table|pg||
nt|sybarra: LOL  |pg||
nt|sybarra: but we made it thru right?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: after a mere 16 years|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but i made LM in decent time|pg||
nt|jcwla: Meanwhile, Chinese Taipei has cut the deficit by 10 by getting to the @D game on 26 - also making 7.|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|rodal f: Normaly trumh would been the best lead, but E want W to lead that color.|pg||

nt|rv: I suspect not though it could be for many other partnerships since fit is not found|pg||
nt|barnets: ok well done|pg||

pc|h6|pc|dA|nt|pelu: Lead @DK to A and now @HA made the play easy|pg||

pc|sT|pc|h7|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|rv: a possible line could be to play for @ds 42 and @s breaking?|pg||

pc|c6|pc|cA|pc|c5|pg||

nt|vugraphzkt: down 1 will fix|pg||

mb|1N|nt|sybarra: thx to out wonderful operator,   great job as always |pg||

nt|davidstern: But no easy road to get there|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: and of course great thx to our specs, for the helpful (and sometimes humorous comments |pg||
nt|janm: Lau chose the latter course (when I'm playing that 4 of a minor is natural, I love to be able to open it)|pg||
nt|davidstern: North will make a move and South has a max perhaps they will find it|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the real problem was a substandard neg double|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  another ambitious 3N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: remaining matches for the day are posted now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: next will be Open: Australia v China Macau   Senior: Indonesia v New Zealand (Cornell)|pg||
mb|2C|nt|janm: In the other room, East also opened 4@c but his partner judged to raise |pg||
nt|kaz08833: this one shd be push|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Thanks K1W1 great job.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: 2 matches tomorrow|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: thx :)|pg||
nt|pzpp: 2 matches tomorrow? I think that they have 3 left|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: thought there were only 2 could be wrong|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: ah, the hand that needs the heart shift|pg||
nt|cascade: an interesting point is that I think that dealing programs need to have published their algorithms to allay suspicion|pg||
nt|ahollan1: guessing 2@C = weak @C + another|pg||
nt|davidstern: There you go|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  on 24HC with no particular source of tricks|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: still a few boards to be played and scored in the open room|pg||
nt|davidstern: So this should be 7 imps to Indonesia assuming 0-1-4-5|pg||
nt|davidstern: For ten tricks|pg||
nt|rodal f: A sac at 5@C but 5@H also on|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: overtake and heart seems right|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: i am booked to do 2 :)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|friggi: my guess was 3@C 3NT|pg||
nt|sybarra: quick shot of something then for you....(what ever that is) |pg||
nt|jcwla: 5 to Indonesia on 27 when Liu failed to lead A and a @S at T2 against 5@DX.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|alchilds: my too may go set|pg||
nt|janm: Yes, and maybe the spade 10 should suggest shifting to a heart?|pg||
nt|pelu: again the 1NT 6-12 created the problem|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Reid -- 1st DBL = PEN  2nd DBL = Takeout [i think]|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Dont understand, if cant x 3@C bid 3@S:)|pg||
pc|c7|nt|fabsayc: this event is really too long, we have to realize how long everybody has already been playing|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|janm: Guess not|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think any spade but ace is really wrong|pg||
nt|janm: Of course, they're not going to beat 4 whatever they do|pg||
nt|rodal f: Did Caledonia steel candy from the opps?:)|pg||
nt|jcwla: Me or your lying eyes?|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: last board and some laughter here|pg||
pc|s4|nt|friggi: needs @H play from Dec, diff to find|pg||
nt|sybarra: my guess is will play @D up from hand |pg||
nt|friggi: agree|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N was 13-15|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @S shift is killer|pg||
nt|sybarra: can China make a profit here?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|henryb:  this one needs 3@c tricks, a reasonable shot, and either 4@h and 2@s or lots of spade tricks|pg||
nt|pelu: in normal system u would pass 2@S|pg||
nt|rv: this should make 9 tricks even with likley @s finesse|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|pelu: best lead|pg||
nt|henryb:  My stomach is growling, so I will leave you. Have fun, and thanks, Peter|pg||

pc|c4|nt|cascade: For those kibitzers who are interested in chess|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ahollan1: absolutely -- i was thinking best defense 300|pg||
nt|rodal f: 22-19 after this board. Then OR left to change the result|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|rv: my thanks to excellent Vu graph operator and wonderful co-commentators Barnet Shenkin and Barbara Travis|pg||
nt|babs59: and thank you RV and Barnet, for not jinxing Australia too much|pg||
pc|cK|nt|fabsayc: no so maybe here a bit more excusable|pg||
nt|barnets: well tks all specs and fellow commentators I am retiring for the night |pg||
pc|c8|nt|cascade: Ker at the other table is a many time NZ Chess champion|pg||

pc|d5|pc|cT|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s8|nt|rv: also a word of appreciation to Roland Wald who organises all these Vu graph broadcats and BBO management for telecasting it live|pg||
nt|rv: finally to all specs for listening to us patiently|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|cascade: about 8 or 9 times i have lost count|pg||
nt|jcwla: Thanks to our excellent operator, PABF, NBZ, all specs - it's been fun.|pg||
nt|jcwla: For now, from Los Angeles, so long.|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: thx :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: good match|pg||
nt|jcwla: NZB even.|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ahollan1: maybe 500 now|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: E could have got a ruff|pg||
nt|rnmalik: By play small @S-guts:)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: playing|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: no after Q@d|pg||
nt|pzpp: the double of 2NT normally shows interest in penalty on at least one of the minors contract, since he does not want to double 3@c, 3@s sounds much more reasonable than pass|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: they are all packing up here instead of playing|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: now E thinking|pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: motionless|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d9|pc|h7|pg||
nt|janm: Interesting how many people are good at both games|pg||
pc|sT|nt|fabsayc: there is a dealing program written by a norwegian|pg||
nt|fabsayc: which produces a lot of wild hands|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this looks like that program|pg||
nt|fabsayc: it is used by some of the dealing equipment|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so wherever the equipment goes|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and i am totally convinced the hands are not random|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the technical term is pseudo random|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but in a run of say a million hands it should converge on the theoretical odds |pg||
nt|vugraphzkt: romm will stay open unti scores are finalised|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @H10 would have been very trusting - an maybe worthy of write-up|pg||
nt|sybarra: interesting position now however |pg||
nt|ahollan1: @D best|pg||
