nt|dannymiles: On board 14, where EW have a thin spade game, Nick bid 4S directly over Judy's limited 1@s opening; with trumps 2-2 and the @dA onside, it was laydown|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ritong: weird bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzjz: was alerted i think not sure yet|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|ritong: oh, it is a cue, no doubt about that|pg||
nt|starkist: maybe xfer|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: possibly xfer, yes|pg||
nt|starkist: i guess x shows both minors|pg||
nt|dannymiles: Definitely a xfer to 2@s. Most pairs play that over 1M opening or overcall followed by DBL, all bids are xfers and a direct 2M is weaker than constructive|pg||
nt|ritong: no matter what, south hand is not really promising  perhaps an immediate 3@s would be more to it|pg||
pc|sA|nt|starkist: yes henri|pg||

nt|ritong: well 5@c looked like a tactical try|pg||
nt|ritong: his hand is not brilliant|pg||
nt|ritong: wasted @s values, thin suits|pg||
nt|ritong: 4@c would be enough imho|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|s7|pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|lml: 1NT can be hard to defend|pg||
nt|buffytvs: the @S2 gives West the impression that declarer has Kx -- hence th cash of the ace|pg||
nt|lml: I like the idea of switching to a spade but the 2 isnt the right card|pg||
nt|lml: if she leads the @SQ for instance and then shift back to a heart that works pretty well|pg||
nt|buffytvs: so declarer has 7 tricks for sure now just by knocking out the @CA|pg||

nt|lml: well he got his diamond shift but can he afford to win the @D9 anyway|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d3|nt|lml: I guess he can win the 9 and play heart heart|pg||
nt|buffytvs: he can just win thw king and play a club -- easy route to 7 tricks|pg||
nt|lml: whe can always overtake the diamond|pg||
nt|lml: its playing for the overtricks that is slowing this down|pg||
nt|buffytvs: yes -- maybe they're all starting to think that every IMP wil be vital in this match|pg||
