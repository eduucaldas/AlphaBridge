nt|flash: we've flipped over to Board 1, so it looks like a 64-board final|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|flash: and we have comparisons!!!|pg||
mb|2C|mb|d|nt|flash: 7 IMPs on Board 10:  1NT making in the other room; 2@D -2 here|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|flash: and, after North passes, East will???|pg||
nt|reisig: 2@c...not for me|pg||
nt|idblu: agree...was going to bid 3@D to play over anything|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|flash: no @D xfer in their arsenal, we'd assume|pg||
nt|bg: its their style 2c followed by 3 dia is weak but Eric messed it up with 3 hearts|pg||
nt|idblu: no machinery to get to 3@D directly|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c2|pc|c7|nt|flash: again, i like Michael's action - he owes partner a trump, but...|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cQ|nt|flash: however, this is headed down, while 3NT made...|pg||
nt|reisig: Do they ever overcall 4 card suits?|pg||
nt|flash: unfortunately, we don't have the details of the auction or play from the Open Room|pg||
nt|flash: so you'd favor 2@C?   forcing or constructive, non-forcing??|pg||
nt|reisig: Can't be forcing ...by Passed hand|pg||
nt|flash: aha...   i expect that wake-up call any minute now...|pg||

pc|h5|pc|hJ|nt|lml: good evening from Toronto|pg||
pc|s2|nt|thurston:  would have been reasonable for W to offer 3NT|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|thurston:  but why not overcall 1NT in first place - what does that hand "look like"?|pg||
nt|flash: good play by West - not sure why East played the Queen|pg||
pc|sT|nt|reisig: reasonable = automatic :)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|vugraphzjq: hi linda|pg||
nt|lml: of course West is actually Gordon from Canada|pg||
nt|lml: this is a four man team and even though they are tired they didnt have time to fly anybody in |pg||
pc|s6|pc|s8|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s9|nt|lml: this has been a tight well played match from the beginning |pg||

nt|flash: 5 more IMPs on Board 11 - a pushy raise to 2NT didn't pay off in the Open Room|pg||
nt|flash: board 12 (where 170 was available in @Ss) pushed in 4@Cs|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|lml: east west have 2 adventages . they have the major major and the cards lie well for them|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: oh and one more ... among their advantages is the vulnerability|pg||
nt|flash: Open Room auction looks too aggressive on this one|pg||
mb|2C|nt|flash: everyone on board for 2NT here?   |pg||
nt|idblu: this appears to be going down to wire ....|pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: most would use 3@D to suggest 3NT won't be good?|pg||
mb|2N|nt|flash: extra pass in there|pg||
nt|reisig: It's OK w me|pg||
nt|reisig: not Puppet - I see|pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: 3@C apparently 'regular' stayman; 3@H to show the 4-card suit|pg||
nt|thurston:  not my cup of anything but Ok for some|pg||
nt|flash: East bid 3@H??|pg||
nt|thurston:  opening may propel them to a slam that makes if declarer attacks spades instead of diamonds|pg||
nt|flash: upside - protect the tenaces; not a big stretch (if any) on values...   downside - can miss a @D slam??|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|lml: I think that Gordon will settle for the game .. yes|pg||
nt|flash: 4@S Kickback (RKCB for @Hs)|pg||
nt|flash: 5@C 0 or 3 (must be 3)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|flash: Binsky!!!|pg||
nt|flash: all right, folks...|pg||
pc|hT|nt|flash: so you've agreed to play Autowood - if there's an ambiguous response to RKCB and the asker signs off, responder must bid on with 3 or 4|pg||
nt|flash: other-sided in Open room, so @H blockage never an issue|pg||
nt|flash: resolved quickly here|pg||
nt|idblu: heading for a push|pg||
pc|h4|nt|flash: is this really ambiguous?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|reisig: Did he not "know" whether 0 or 3?|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|flash: (for the non-Canadians in the gallery, Bob Binsky was so famous for getting to the 5-level on his own steam that they named the entire level after him)|pg||
nt|reisig: infamous|pg||
nt|flash: that too  :)|pg||
nt|idblu: @DJ and guess the 10 may   save a trick|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|pc|dQ|pc|d9|pg||
nt|flash: board 13 also fetched a @S lead vs 3nt in the Open Room - another push|pg||
pc|dA|pc|s5|pc|d7|pc|dT|pg||
pc|d5|pc|c6|pc|dJ|pc|dK|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lml: so everybody has had time to wake up|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s7|nt|flash: as usual, if the answer to RKCB doesn't give you the information you need, perhaps RKCB was the wrong approach??|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|d6|pc|h8|pc|d2|nt|flash: i'm skeptical of that play|pg||
nt|flash: either declarer ruffed high in dummy or North overruffed with the 9??|pg||
nt|flash: now he'll escape for down 1|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|d8|pc|c9|pc|s4|nt|thurston:  soon we'll have a claim for 11|pg||
nt|idblu: hard to play for "bella"  KQ alone in @H|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|reisig: oops|pg||
nt|flash: or make it|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|nt|flash: board 12 in as a push|pg||
pc|cK|nt|flash: back to 12??|pg||
nt|reisig: nope|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|flash: ok - the @D was ruffed low and overruffed with the 9; now North has made his @HA|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s3|pc|sT|pc|sA|pg||
nt|flash: and an overtrick|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|idblu: a little breathing room....but still a full 1/4 + to go|pg||
nt|bg: probably getting out with a push on 14 Flock also got ot 4 spades|pg||
nt|flash: Gartaganis +3 in the Open final|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1S|nt|lml: so east west would like to be in five of a minor.  It may be hard now|pg||
nt|buffytvs: especially if Ross takes a bid here|pg||
nt|flash: either a generous evaluation in the context of 14+ - 17, or an upgrade??   (or a different range)|pg||
nt|idblu: that match going down to the last board as well it appears|pg||
mb|1N|nt|flash: @Cs and a higher-ranking suit??   or @Ds or a major-minor 2-suiter??|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: presumably that's a txfr|pg||
nt|lml: yes|pg||
nt|lml: I am sure it is|pg||
nt|guppy: well - 3N is even better than than 5m and Piotr found the winning initial action (1N vs. X) to steer them there|pg||
nt|lml: 5@H is a decent save or 5@C|pg||
mb|3N|nt|lml: 5@D|pg||
nt|lml: either|pg||
nt|buffytvs: tough call for East now|pg||
nt|lml: With those trump I bet he bids on|pg||
nt|lml: if partner has diamonds it looks like he only has 2.5 losers|pg||
nt|buffytvs: a full 18 with a diamond fit, but does he want to commit to 11 tricks?|pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: looks like Hello...   so North has shown @Ss and a minor|pg||
nt|reisig: 4@s is not the worst contract ...but fails|pg||
nt|flash: South's 2@D was forced (in case North had a single-suiter in @Ds)|pg||
nt|flash: 2NT would ask which minor (but South has a pretty good idea which one it is)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: Alert: 2c=4+ C and plus 5C Maj. 2D: bid your Maj.|pg||
nt|flash: and down the stretch they come...|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: well that will be a steal then|pg||
nt|buffytvs: thgouht he might dbl|pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: sorry; still at the Belmont...   Drosselmeyer???   who had Drosselmeyer???|pg||
nt|reisig: Belmont?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|lml: I think he should bid|pg||
nt|flash: i might've chosen 2NT instead of 2@D - it's a cue bid, saying whichever hand-type you have, i've got support...|pg||
nt|idblu: I had Dimpflemeyer|pg||
nt|idblu: what he pay|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lml: if partner has nothing else he has good diamonds|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|pg||
pc|d2|nt|buffytvs: avoiding the Elvis Coup in diamonds, which as it happens, doesn't cost|pg||
nt|lml: maybe he didnt think clubs was a transfer|pg||
nt|buffytvs: he had even better clubs|pg||
nt|lml: otherwise that is sort of a strange lead|pg||
nt|buffytvs: what would you have led from his hand?|pg||
nt|lml: the elvis coup|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: keith is looking for some high cards|pg||
nt|buffytvs: me too|pg||
nt|thurston:  jc gave the non-vul Joey lots of room by passingbut a raise would have been a tad aggressive|pg||
pc|dA|nt|flash: didn't stick around for that - went off at low double-digits...|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d8|pg||
nt|buffytvs: there's a 10 :)|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s2|pc|c2|pc|s4|pg||
nt|idblu: 1 imp for flock here|pg||
pc|c5|nt|lml: fortunately he doesnt need to get to dummy|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|nt|flash: 13-1; paid $28....   Drosselmeyer???   who had Drosselmeyer???|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|reisig: Normal to give room to a favorable bids|pg||
nt|reisig: Put Joey back in|pg||
nt|idblu: 13-1..pd 28|pg||
pc|d3|nt|lml: 2@H over 1NT doesnt have to show much but Taylor's hand was less than not much|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dK|pc|d4|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lml: now Piotrk nows the diamond position|pg||
nt|lml: and the club position and the heart position....|pg||
nt|flash: now has to revert to the off-suits, but...|pg||

nt|lml: that reaffirms my view that Piotrk may have thought it was clubs|pg||
nt|flash: so we'll assume the sequence of plays was a bit differnt...|pg||
nt|reisig: :)|pg||
nt|flash: 12 and 13 in as pushes|pg||
nt|thurston:  Shirley would have if she were here as would we all!|pg||
nt|flash: board 14, indeed in as a push|pg||
nt|flash: somehow, we don't expect 15 to be a push|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: true|pg||
nt|flash: next-to-last board of this quarter; re-start scheduled in half an hour|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: Piotr|pg||
mb|1D|nt|lml: I can see no reason for any penalty... they got it all..|pg||
nt|guppy: his choice of opening lead (@cA) also strongly suggested same|pg||
nt|flash: again, Eric Murray is scheduled to play the next two quarters|pg||
nt|reisig: My kinda overcall :) :)|pg||
nt|idblu: tend to agree|pg||
nt|flash: next-to-last board of the set; final quarter scheduled in 35 minutes|pg||
mb|1S|nt|lml: yes we discussed that a while ago|pg||
nt|lml: but welcome :)|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: I guess 2NT shows a heart raise of some sort|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: thanks !|pg||
mb|p|nt|reisig: Nice swing to Murray here|pg||
pc|hA|nt|buffytvs: the C!A is a disappointment to declarer -- it's a trick, but he'd far rather have the @DK for example|pg||
nt|buffytvs: @CA|pg||
nt|lml: true but there is enough to work with in dummy|pg||
nt|buffytvs: oh yes|pg||
nt|lml: this may take a while though|pg||
nt|flash: as we can see (by moving your cursor over the Open Room result on this screen), the Open Room auction didn't include N-S|pg||
nt|flash: while this one playing out....    thnx to our operator, Donna Dizig, for a great job|pg||
nt|idblu: double part score swing|pg||
nt|flash: 6 IMPs worth?|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h9|nt|flash: the favorable trump and @H positions make 12 tricks available|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|buffytvs: he could play this as a dummy reversal|pg||
nt|idblu: they always come in handy|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s6|pc|s7|nt|flash: but dummy entries are at a premium|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|lml: I think he will just set up diamonds|pg||
nt|lml: probably about now|pg||
nt|buffytvs: seems simplest|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|nt|flash: now, Ace and a trump|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s5|pg||
nt|lml: definitely about now!|pg||
nt|buffytvs: he might well guess the diamond position seeing the 9 fall|pg||
nt|lml: I am certain he will guess the position but I am usually wrong|pg||
nt|lml: he knows the spade honors are likely split and Piotr has 0-6 so there isnt much room for diamond honors|pg||
nt|flash: as safest|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dA|pc|d7|pc|d2|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|buffytvs: yes -- good point about the spades|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h3|pc|h6|pg||
nt|buffytvs: as predicted|pg||
nt|buffytvs: wd|pg||
nt|buffytvs: now things are pretty straightforward|pg||
pc|dT|nt|lml: yes he could claim if he wants to|pg||
nt|lml: I claim!|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|nt|flash: 4@H making 7 for 11 IMPs on 15|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|sA|nt|buffytvs: ruff the diamond high, return with a trump, give up the last two spades|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|h7|pc|d4|pg||
pc|sK|nt|idblu: certainly better than 3@C making 7|pg||

nt|flash: half-hour to re-start...|pg||
nt|reisig: A chance for a swing to EW|pg||

mb|p|nt|lml: Piotr has a nice hand|pg||

nt|buffytvs: going to behard to avoid 3NT, but not sure you can get to 9 tricks|pg||

mb|4S|nt|lml: yeah I think they can make 3NT anyway|pg||

nt|lml: as long as they guess spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: the key is to cash the ace first|pg||
nt|buffytvs: if you don[t guess spades, you may be struggling|pg||
nt|reisig: never mind :)|pg||
nt|flash: not the start of a smooth road to 5@Cs|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: now will these two 4-3-3-3 hands avoid the spade fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: he's oging to get a diamond lead, and will take the inference that North is likely to have longer spades, and play a spade to the king (I think)|pg||

nt|buffytvs: neitehr deterred by the 4333 shape|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lml: he is going to need some help from his friends|pg||
nt|buffytvs: but 10 tricks in spades are even more difficult than 9 in NT on this deal|pg||
nt|lml: well the heart lead didnt hurt him|pg||
nt|buffytvs: yes -- Keith avoided the club lead|pg||
nt|lml: if he guesses spades there might be some sort of endplay|pg||
nt|buffytvs: which would blow a trick|pg||
nt|lml: so how can you make it|pg||
nt|buffytvs: strip hearts, draw trumps, and play a diamond, hoping North ducks?|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|nt|buffytvs: at matchpoints I suspect it would have been a different story|pg||

mb|p|nt|flash: but JC lets Joey out...|pg||

nt|reisig: Maybe - they use neg free bids|pg||
nt|idblu: 4@H?|pg||
mb|3C|nt|lml: he should make this so a small loss|pg||
nt|lml: really not a tough hand |pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: 3 IMPs -- but a potential game swing on the last board, so don't go away|pg||
nt|flash: thnx, Stevie|pg||
nt|reisig: 3@c?|pg||
nt|reisig: I like that bid|pg||

pc|h3|pc|h5|pc|hA|pc|h9|pg||

nt|lml: that was good since it really held the loss |pg||
nt|buffytvs: in the oehr room South played in 4@H.|pg||
nt|flash: 5 IMPs to Flock on Board 9 - all the tricks in a @D partial here; 3NT in the other room|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|buffytvs: The defense started club club and then played a diamond through, which declarer misguessed for down 1|pg||
nt|lml: I can guess how it went down club club diamond threw|pg||
nt|reisig: This hand might get exciting|pg||
nt|flash: 2NT = limit raise or better in @Hs (usually promises at least 4 trumps)|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: i would like to see a good reason for guessing the diamonds|pg||
nt|lml: that is cruel|pg||
nt|buffytvs: don't think there is one -- but potentially Korbel could pick up a game swing here|pg||
nt|flash: would 4@C be a better description?   or would we need a @S honor and something more robust in @Ds for that??|pg||
nt|reisig: a fast 4@h|pg||
nt|idblu: or 2! S|pg||
mb|2S|nt|lml: it really is a coin toss|pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: would a 3@D call be fit-showing?|pg||
nt|reisig: NS will likely find 5@c....then what?|pg||
nt|flash: would that be the best description??|pg||
nt|idblu: now 4@H|pg||
mb|4H|nt|lml: no reason to go either way|pg||
mb|p|nt|starkist: maybe they'll lead one|pg||
nt|buffytvs: thids auction is different though -- West had a chnace to double 1@H as a passed hand -- so there are some inferences|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so failure to lead one is a clue|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: failure to lead one from the ace when you have the @CKQ?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hey, all i have is straw|pg||
nt|lml: I think the clues are slim|pg||
nt|buffytvs: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|bg: not sure why the slow approach just bid 4 hearts|pg||
pc|s9|nt|lml: in the end you go with your gut I suppose|pg||
nt|buffytvs: which one of them looks like they have it...|pg||
nt|reisig: I'd just jump to 4@h ...I don't have to play it!|pg||
nt|idblu: :)  always passing the blame|pg||
nt|reisig: yup|pg||
nt|reisig: Not a hand that rates to swing the match |pg||
pc|s5|pc|s7|pc|sA|pg||
nt|lml: something like that|pg||
nt|fabsayc: use the oswald jacoby stare|pg||
nt|idblu: nope|pg||
pc|cK|nt|flash: we can see that 5@Hs makes|pg||
nt|thurston:  best description of that hand would be a fit jump if partnership infected in that way but I like 4C splinter|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c7|nt|buffytvs: well we didn't consider that|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|pc|s6|pc|s3|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s4|nt|starkist: now play for split aces|pg||
nt|reisig: Does Pass over 5@c show singleton?|pg||
pc|h7|nt|lml: here we come|pg||
nt|lml: I bet he gets it right|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|cA|nt|buffytvs: so this will be either 5 or 6 IMPs to Korbel, and a slender lead to take to dinner|pg||
pc|c6|pc|d4|nt|flash: i'm not sure that any choice would get the partnership to 5@H, but....|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|thurston:  the route E chose works ok if opps cease and desist but they so rarely do anymore|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|idblu: home and cooled out...|pg||
pc|h3|nt|buffytvs: oh no, we had dinner,m sorry -- into the 4th set|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h9|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pc|h4|nt|flash: should be forcing, so 0 or 1??|pg||

nt|buffytvs: thx to our operator Susy, and all the commentators.  Hope you enjoyed it|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: one more set |pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: be back in 10-15 min|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 5 minute break, i think not|pg||
nt|buffytvs: probably 15-20 min|pg||
