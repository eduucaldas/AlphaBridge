nt|lml: its hard because south didnt check for a spade fit|pg||
nt|lml: that suggested she didn't have four of them|pg||
nt|chat: would u have found it Nick?|pg||
nt|joel 88: y    difficult defence    but N - S should have bid more in the Closed Room|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it would have been an interesting defensive idea to lead a nonspade, because when in with heart ace u can lead spade & almost surely get your ruff. but that has dangers too..|pg||

nt|lml: hi Joel|pg||
nt|marlowepi: what i dont understand is the stutterstep of 2S then 4S....if your hand is worth 4S then why not bid it at once? when you say 2S, you should be intending to respect partner's ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: decision|pg||
nt|vugraphzjr: sorry about the team names being reversed, the players did not sit where they needed to be|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: I was thinking about that.  I like 4@S directly myself|pg||
mb|1D|nt|lml: that might have got 5@H the phantom|pg||
nt|joel 88: We have the Cimon team (from Ontario + Quebec) versus the Smith team (from BC)|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: i do too, though my main [point is simply that one needs to conduct internally consistent auctions. |pg||
nt|lml: We did some introductions, cities and all earlier Joel|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it was 4S that was the phantom|pg||
mb|2D|nt|lml: I pointed out that I have played with both east and west|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: and frequently against north and south|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|marlowepi: and in fact the N hand has enough defense that she has no real reason to be confident that 4H will make|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|lml: no but i like 4@S because it might make or it might be a good save and it puts pressure on east|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|marlowepi: sure, me too. but once you bid 2S you are committing to passing 4H. and that turns out to be the winning call, too, because bidding 4S turns a plus into a minus|pg||

mb|p|nt|lml: Francine is working towards the diamond slam and it does sound like Pamela has five of them on this auction|pg||

nt|joel 88: the Operator did well to correct Cimon's name       North is June Pocock, not Jean|pg||
nt|lml: I dont think that is what happened|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in most partnerships, following the game-before-slam principle, 3 level bids should be presumed to be gropes toward finding best game. that would mean 3S is in serach of a spade ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: stop, and regardless of W prowess as declarer 8xx does not meet everyone's standards for a stopper|pg||

mb|1N|nt|flash: pls remember that the team names are reversed|pg||
mb|p|nt|duck_72: NS plays KERI, not stayman, so thier NT auctions wil seem quite strange|pg||
