mb|p|mb|p|pc|d9|nt|flash: we'll see where in the 16-board set the Closed Room starts, so we'll have an idea of when we'll get scores/comparisons|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|d5|pg||
nt|czyzyk: It seems as Darren will play spades from the top|pg||
nt|czyzyk: And it will come up to the club guess|pg||
nt|flash: on that lead, 12 tricks were available, but declarer wouldn't risk the @S finesse (and a possible ruff)|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: hi everyone :)|pg||
nt|flash: salut, Nik|pg||
nt|czyzyk: Hello Nic|pg||
pc|sA|nt|niclecuyer: ready for some action?|pg||

mb|p|mb|3S|nt|vugraphzjx: the writing of the explanation of 3h is very long and didnt get to me|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|bibanu: not the same aproch by E as other table |pg||

mb|p|mb|p|pc|c4|pc|cJ|pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||

mb|p|mb|2S|nt|niclecuyer: did he not have 10 tricks with the spade hook?|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|nt|flash: 4@C is, again, shortness|pg||
nt|flash: since Korbel didn't raise directly, Wolpert knows he's got 3-card support opposite?|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: wow that X of 1Sp really put it to them |pg||
nt|niclecuyer: another Qxx of spades onside, let's see what they will do here |pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|niclecuyer: 5Sp probably read as general try or about trumps - what do you guys think?|pg||
nt|flash: 5@S a general slam try, we'd guess...   Wolpert is interested, but doesn't have a cue bid (nor would RKCB gain him anything)|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|flash: hard to read it as trumps, given the AKJTx??|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|nt|niclecuyer: no but on Korbel's side|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|flash: so the slam is a bit better than 3-2 trumps with the Q on-side  (he can probably pick up 4-1 trumps, as well)|pg||
nt|czyzyk: Usually 5@s asks for the quality of spades or shows it denying help in the other suits. They were perhaps not on the same wavelength...|pg||
nt|flash: marginal, not vul; probably bid it, vul??|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: I would think so, I think I would just have close my eyes and bid 6 holding the good spades - the auction sort of told you where the spade queen was if needed|pg||

nt|gelutu: tomorrow will be more 32 boards to play|pg||
nt|gelutu: here are two pairs who performed very well in 1st segment of the Final|pg||
mb|1D|nt|lml: hi |pg||
mb|d|nt|lml: we can see 6@S makes|pg||
mb|1H|nt|gelutu: Edy Munteanu playing with Eugen Chelu and Max Rotaru with Ov Ghigheci|pg||
nt|pisoy: 4@H a little bit better then 3nt|pg||
nt|vugraphzjx: 1h alerted as spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: but it is not a slam you want to be in missing the queen of trump and an ace|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|pisoy: in the last board|pg||
nt|lml: the double does help a lot though|pg||
nt|lml: now you are likely going to work out who has the trump queen|pg||
nt|lml: of course you have to find the spade suit|pg||
mb|3S|nt|gelutu: both pairs play improved natural systems|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: 1@H was obviously spades and now campbell shows he has 5|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: with some help from the opponents it is just too tough to bid it|pg||
pc|h4|nt|pisoy: in a good day you could make it ,starting with Q@D|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|nt|gelutu: Max-Ov play 1NT 14-16|pg||
nt|gelutu: and first unmakeable game is bid by Locmotiva here|pg||
nt|donsabin: not this one:)|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|lml: Campbell has to consider bad breaks.  |pg||
nt|vugraphzjx: campbell in thought...going 'uh huh' under his breath a lot|pg||
nt|lml: yes this is a tough hand in a way... lots to think about|pg||
nt|lml: maybe a spade finesse, diamond to dummy, spade finesse|pg||
nt|lml: still leaving a trump in dummy|pg||
nt|lml: even if the second diamond is ruffed he is okay if trump are 3-2|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|pc|c5|pc|c7|pg||
nt|gelutu: seems impossible for EW not take AD after 3 times gain lead in S, so -1|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h2|pc|h9|nt|gelutu: but now|pg||
nt|pisoy: no:)|pg||
nt|pisoy: this is a flat one|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|gelutu: discard is possible|pg||
nt|gelutu: and impossible game is home|pg||
nt|lml: if he can pick up trump and make one club ruff he is good|pg||
nt|lml: that gives him 3 diamonds, 5 spades, two hearts and a club ruff|pg||
pc|s6|nt|lml: one more than enough actually|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sJ|pc|s2|pg||
nt|lml: ruff a club|pg||
nt|lml: and repeat the finesse|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cT|pc|s7|pc|c8|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s4|pc|sT|nt|gelutu: any other leads seems better... now Edy will not go wrong |pg||

nt|niclecuyer: yep|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|czyzyk: Welcome Isabelle Smith, a winner of the Canadian Women Team Championships|pg||

mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dJ|nt|flash: 2@S a @H raise|pg||

nt|niclecuyer: he will make this|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dK|pc|d2|pc|d7|pg||
nt|flash: he'll be able to strip the red suits|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: strips the hand - and play A and a club - I think he has enough entries|pg||
pc|s9|nt|czyzyk: Usually in Europe the same hands are played at the same time - more fun to the spectators seeing the scorescompared virtually from the beginning.|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|hJ|pc|hA|pg||
pc|h4|pc|c4|pc|hT|pc|hK|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|nt|sommer: ..or 1@S?:)|pg||

mb|1S|mb|2S|nt|sommer: pew|pg||
nt|donsabin: seems like|pg||
mb|4S|nt|sommer: I would not open 1@S..strong enough for 2@C..|pg||
nt|lml: this looks like it is headed to the same spade game.  |pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|donsabin: weird decision not to bid 1@s|pg||
nt|pisoy: yes,strange|pg||
mb|p|pc|dJ|nt|bibanu: 2clubs, nat or any strong gand |pg||
nt|sommer: yes|pg||
nt|bibanu: *hand|pg||
nt|gelutu: only 7 tricks in NT with good defence|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hJ|nt|gelutu: H lead and C after a signal from N  on second D|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sommer: 2@C - 2@D - 2@S - 2NT - 3@H - 4@H .. and now dare 5@C..not impossible|pg||
nt|sommer: ..but agree - not many will find 6@H|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|lml: the cards are nice and friendly north south|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d7|nt|gelutu: duck first D of course|pg||
pc|d5|nt|gelutu: now Edy could signal with small club|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|s5|nt|gelutu: duck again is better in my opinion|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|nt|gelutu: this limit undertricks to -1|pg||

pc|h9|pc|h5|pc|s3|pc|h6|pg||
nt|lml: after the elimination ace and one will work.  Is that where he is headed?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjx: balcombes head is down in thought|pg||
nt|lml: Gord has to have at least one of the club honors,he knows that|pg||
nt|vugraphzjx: he should also know that E has one too because of the 2S bid|pg||
nt|lml: yes|pg||
nt|lml: club honors are likely split|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c8|pc|cA|pc|c2|pg||
nt|lml: so ace and one seems logical|pg||

nt|czyzyk: Good play by Nick Gartaganis.|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: good start for the Gartaganis team|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: Will north overcall the 3Cl bid?|pg||
nt|czyzyk: Well, here the score comparison is delayed for as long as is technically possible (at some point each board is played at a single table)|pg||
nt|flash: i've had a suggestion that this is a Newfie movement - the boards start at half-past...|pg||

nt|gelutu: part-score battle|pg||
nt|lml: east west have a very unusual result|pg||
nt|lml: and it could be duplicated here|pg||
nt|lml: if Balcombe passes and Klimowicz bids 3NT the lead will not be ovcious|pg||
mb|p|nt|gelutu: NS may make 3M, but EW is close to game in C if NS lead S|pg||
nt|lml: the lead that helps is a heart|pg||
mb|3N|nt|sommer: 4@S looks more like it|pg||
nt|lml: which could happen|pg||
nt|lml: things will go slowly on the @DK lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzjx: piotr pulled out 3n, mixed it in with his hand...put in back in the box...and then shrugged and bid it...|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|gelutu: here Max must have a toy to describe his invitational support in C|pg||

nt|lml: we will see a lot of clubs|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mcphee: E opens 1@D here |pg||
nt|lml: and of course a low diamond works too|pg||
nt|vugraphzjx: quick claim after that lead, i think|pg||
pc|d8|nt|gelutu: this seems to be 2H alerted I suppose|pg||
nt|gelutu: now Max described diamonds and clubs|pg||
pc|d7|nt|bibanu: 2d like 2h , but better hand ?|pg||

nt|lml: they didnt get clubs right at the other table.  South did throw one during the run of the hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjx: wont have that problem here|pg||

pc|h6|pg||

pc|h8|pc|s2|nt|gelutu: after you see length in Spade in N hand could be easier to fin the play in D.. in this idea 6N and 6S are better than 6D|pg||
