nt|flash: we've flipped over to Board 1, so it looks like a 64-board final|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|flash: and we have comparisons!!!|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1H|nt|flash: 7 IMPs on Board 10:  1NT making in the other room; 2@D -2 here|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|flash: and, after North passes, East will???|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|flash: again, i like Michael's action - he owes partner a trump, but...|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d2|pc|dK|nt|flash: however, this is headed down, while 3NT made...|pg||
nt|reisig: Do they ever overcall 4 card suits?|pg||
nt|flash: unfortunately, we don't have the details of the auction or play from the Open Room|pg||
nt|flash: so you'd favor 2@C?   forcing or constructive, non-forcing??|pg||
nt|reisig: Can't be forcing ...by Passed hand|pg||
nt|flash: aha...   i expect that wake-up call any minute now...|pg||

pc|c9|pg||
nt|thurston:  would have been reasonable for W to offer 3NT|pg||
pc|c5|nt|thurston:  but why not overcall 1NT in first place - what does that hand "look like"?|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|reisig: reasonable = automatic :)|pg||
pc|h7|nt|vugraphzjq: hi linda|pg||
nt|lml: of course West is actually Gordon from Canada|pg||
nt|lml: this is a four man team and even though they are tired they didnt have time to fly anybody in |pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d3|pc|d4|nt|lml: this has been a tight well played match from the beginning |pg||

nt|flash: 5 more IMPs on Board 11 - a pushy raise to 2NT didn't pay off in the Open Room|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|lml: east west have 2 adventages . they have the major major and the cards lie well for them|pg||
mb|3C|nt|lml: oh and one more ... among their advantages is the vulnerability|pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: everyone on board for 2NT here?   |pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|flash: extra pass in there|pg||
nt|reisig: It's OK w me|pg||
nt|reisig: not Puppet - I see|pg||
mb|4S|nt|flash: 3@C apparently 'regular' stayman; 3@H to show the 4-card suit|pg||
nt|thurston:  not my cup of anything but Ok for some|pg||
nt|flash: East bid 3@H??|pg||
nt|thurston:  opening may propel them to a slam that makes if declarer attacks spades instead of diamonds|pg||
nt|flash: upside - protect the tenaces; not a big stretch (if any) on values...   downside - can miss a @D slam??|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|nt|lml: I think that Gordon will settle for the game .. yes|pg||
nt|flash: 4@S Kickback (RKCB for @Hs)|pg||
nt|flash: 5@C 0 or 3 (must be 3)|pg||
mb|p|mb|5H|nt|flash: Binsky!!!|pg||
nt|flash: all right, folks...|pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: so you've agreed to play Autowood - if there's an ambiguous response to RKCB and the asker signs off, responder must bid on with 3 or 4|pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: is this really ambiguous?|pg||
mb|p|nt|reisig: Did he not "know" whether 0 or 3?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|flash: (for the non-Canadians in the gallery, Bob Binsky was so famous for getting to the 5-level on his own steam that they named the entire level after him)|pg||

pc|d8|pc|dJ|pc|h7|pc|hA|pg||
nt|flash: i'm skeptical of that play|pg||
nt|flash: either declarer ruffed high in dummy or North overruffed with the 9??|pg||

nt|thurston:  soon we'll have a claim for 11|pg||

nt|buffytvs: especially if Ross takes a bid here|pg||
nt|flash: either a generous evaluation in the context of 14+ - 17, or an upgrade??   (or a different range)|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|flash: @Cs and a higher-ranking suit??   or @Ds or a major-minor 2-suiter??|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: presumably that's a txfr|pg||
nt|lml: yes|pg||
nt|lml: I am sure it is|pg||
nt|guppy: well - 3N is even better than than 5m and Piotr found the winning initial action (1N vs. X) to steer them there|pg||
nt|lml: 5@H is a decent save or 5@C|pg||
mb|2S|nt|lml: 5@D|pg||
nt|lml: either|pg||
nt|buffytvs: tough call for East now|pg||
nt|lml: With those trump I bet he bids on|pg||
nt|lml: if partner has diamonds it looks like he only has 2.5 losers|pg||
nt|buffytvs: a full 18 with a diamond fit, but does he want to commit to 11 tricks?|pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: looks like Hello...   so North has shown @Ss and a minor|pg||
nt|reisig: 4@s is not the worst contract ...but fails|pg||
nt|flash: South's 2@D was forced (in case North had a single-suiter in @Ds)|pg||
nt|flash: 2NT would ask which minor (but South has a pretty good idea which one it is)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: Alert: 2c=4+ C and plus 5C Maj. 2D: bid your Maj.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: well that will be a steal then|pg||
nt|buffytvs: thgouht he might dbl|pg||
mb|p|pc|h8|nt|lml: I think he should bid|pg||
nt|flash: i might've chosen 2NT instead of 2@D - it's a cue bid, saying whichever hand-type you have, i've got support...|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lml: if partner has nothing else he has good diamonds|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|c5|nt|buffytvs: avoiding the Elvis Coup in diamonds, which as it happens, doesn't cost|pg||
nt|lml: maybe he didnt think clubs was a transfer|pg||
nt|buffytvs: he had even better clubs|pg||
nt|lml: otherwise that is sort of a strange lead|pg||
nt|buffytvs: what would you have led from his hand?|pg||
nt|lml: the elvis coup|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: keith is looking for some high cards|pg||
nt|buffytvs: me too|pg||
nt|thurston:  jc gave the non-vul Joey lots of room by passingbut a raise would have been a tad aggressive|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c8|pc|cK|pg||
nt|buffytvs: there's a 10 :)|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dT|pc|d2|pc|dA|pg||
pc|cT|nt|lml: fortunately he doesnt need to get to dummy|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cA|pc|c6|pg||
nt|reisig: Normal to give room to a favorable bids|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lml: 2@H over 1NT doesnt have to show much but Taylor's hand was less than not much|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s2|pc|s9|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lml: now Piotrk nows the diamond position|pg||
nt|lml: and the club position and the heart position....|pg||
nt|flash: now has to revert to the off-suits, but...|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|s5|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|d5|nt|lml: so this is a potential pickup for Korbel |pg||
nt|flash: down 2 (for no particularly good reason??)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|flash: surely, West would pull dummy's trump??|pg||

nt|lml: that reaffirms my view that Piotrk may have thought it was clubs|pg||
nt|flash: so we'll assume the sequence of plays was a bit differnt...|pg||
nt|reisig: :)|pg||
nt|flash: 12 and 13 in as pushes|pg||
nt|thurston:  Shirley would have if she were here as would we all!|pg||
mb|1H|nt|buffytvs: true|pg||
nt|flash: next-to-last board of this quarter; re-start scheduled in half an hour|pg||
mb|1S|nt|lml: Piotr|pg||
mb|2D|nt|lml: I can see no reason for any penalty... they got it all..|pg||
nt|guppy: his choice of opening lead (@cA) also strongly suggested same|pg||
nt|flash: again, Eric Murray is scheduled to play the next two quarters|pg||

mb|2H|nt|lml: yes we discussed that a while ago|pg||

mb|3C|mb|p|mb|5C|nt|lml: I guess 2NT shows a heart raise of some sort|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: thanks !|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|nt|buffytvs: the C!A is a disappointment to declarer -- it's a trick, but he'd far rather have the @DK for example|pg||
nt|buffytvs: @CA|pg||
nt|lml: true but there is enough to work with in dummy|pg||
nt|buffytvs: oh yes|pg||
nt|lml: this may take a while though|pg||
nt|flash: as we can see (by moving your cursor over the Open Room result on this screen), the Open Room auction didn't include N-S|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|flash: the favorable trump and @H positions make 12 tricks available|pg||
pc|h2|nt|buffytvs: he could play this as a dummy reversal|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
nt|flash: but dummy entries are at a premium|pg||
pc|cA|nt|lml: I think he will just set up diamonds|pg||
nt|lml: probably about now|pg||
nt|buffytvs: seems simplest|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|nt|flash: now, Ace and a trump|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|c4|nt|lml: definitely about now!|pg||
nt|buffytvs: he might well guess the diamond position seeing the 9 fall|pg||
nt|lml: I am certain he will guess the position but I am usually wrong|pg||
nt|lml: he knows the spade honors are likely split and Piotr has 0-6 so there isnt much room for diamond honors|pg||
nt|flash: as safest|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cJ|pc|cK|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|nt|buffytvs: yes -- good point about the spades|pg||

nt|flash: thnx to Paul and Richie (and Stevie earlier) for helping guide us through the boards|pg||
nt|flash: re-start in just under half an hour...    useful lead for Murray|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: unfortunately they've started us 8 bds apart again, so no comparisons for the next four boards either|pg||
mb|1C|nt|lml: Piotr has a nice hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: you know how I feel about aces|pg||
nt|buffytvs: going to behard to avoid 3NT, but not sure you can get to 9 tricks|pg||
mb|1H|nt|flash: board 14 also in as a push; 2 boards left in the Open Room|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: yeah I think they can make 3NT anyway|pg||
nt|buffytvs: but the spades are friendly, as long as you don't play Restricted Choice|pg||
nt|lml: as long as they guess spades|pg||
mb|2H|nt|lml: the key is to cash the ace first|pg||
nt|buffytvs: if you don[t guess spades, you may be struggling|pg||
mb|d|nt|lml: now will these two 4-3-3-3 hands avoid the spade fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: he's oging to get a diamond lead, and will take the inference that North is likely to have longer spades, and play a spade to the king (I think)|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|buffytvs: then he may well go wrong|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: guess you cant|pg||
nt|buffytvs: neitehr deterred by the 4333 shape|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: he is going to need some help from his friends|pg||
nt|buffytvs: but 10 tricks in spades are even more difficult than 9 in NT on this deal|pg||
nt|lml: well the heart lead didnt hurt him|pg||
nt|buffytvs: yes -- Keith avoided the club lead|pg||
nt|lml: if he guesses spades there might be some sort of endplay|pg||
nt|buffytvs: which would blow a trick|pg||
nt|lml: so how can you make it|pg||
nt|buffytvs: strip hearts, draw trumps, and play a diamond, hoping North ducks?|pg||
nt|flash: testing the brakes...   a bit close to the edge of the cliff, but...|pg||
pc|hK|nt|reisig: 4@d ...a tad pushy|pg||
nt|thurston:  cu all later - off to check Open Teams|pg||
nt|flash: thnx, Paul|pg||

nt|vugraphzjq: gords head is in his hands|pg||

nt|flash: but with 4 trumps and a singleton, 2@S (or 3 if it's pre-emptive) seems simpler|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p!|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sK|nt|lml: 7 tricks should be fine|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sQ|pc|s8|pg||
nt|lml: playing on diamonds is fine|pg||
nt|flash: i like the lead of the King - try to hold the lead and let partner tell you what shift is best|pg||
nt|flash: @SQ for a @D?|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d6|pc|dK|pc|d2|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sJ|pc|s3|pc|s7|pg||
nt|flash: very smooth (and well done)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|fabsayc: cashing the hearts would have left an interesting ending|pg||
nt|buffytvs: that's exactly what I was saying to Linda here|pg||
nt|lml: that would have been much harder for declarer|pg||
nt|buffytvs: he has some toughn pitches to make|pg||
nt|lml: but now the end is nigh... as the crooner used to sing|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: keith holding us up|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I think he's making now whatever Keith does on this trick|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he is counting on those penalty minutes to score :)|pg||
nt|lml: for sure|pg||
nt|lml: probably +1|pg||
pc|c3|nt|buffytvs: declarer likes that shift|pg||
nt|lml: that is an imp|pg||
pc|c6|nt|buffytvs: the way this match is going, 1 IMP could be critical tomorrow night|pg||
nt|lml: I take that back|pg||
nt|lml: he will just make it|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
mc|9|nt|reisig: a great save ...-50|pg||
nt|flash: Board 7 in as a push|pg||
nt|reisig: I think West is closer to responding 4@s than 1NT|pg||
nt|flash: 5 more IMPs on Board 8 - the 4@D contract in here...   @S partial in the other room|pg||

nt|buffytvs: a very well-contested acution in the Open Room, with NS getting too high|pg||
mb|2C|nt|buffytvs: fortunatley escaping undoubled|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|buffytvs: at matchpoints I suspect it would have been a different story|pg||

mb|p|nt|flash: but JC lets Joey out...|pg||
nt|snoraa: gotta run.."cu" all later::)|pg||
nt|reisig: Maybe - they use neg free bids|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lml: he should make this so a small loss|pg||
nt|lml: really not a tough hand |pg||
pc|hT|nt|buffytvs: 3 IMPs -- but a potential game swing on the last board, so don't go away|pg||

nt|flash: (it is West's highest spot card, but there's probably no rush to get a @S through)|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sK|pg||

nt|lml: that was good since it really held the loss |pg||
nt|buffytvs: in the oehr room South played in 4@H.|pg||
nt|flash: 5 IMPs to Flock on Board 9 - all the tricks in a @D partial here; 3NT in the other room|pg||
mb|1H|mb|d|mb|2N!|nt|buffytvs: The defense started club club and then played a diamond through, which declarer misguessed for down 1|pg||
nt|lml: I can guess how it went down club club diamond threw|pg||
nt|reisig: This hand might get exciting|pg||
nt|flash: 2NT = limit raise or better in @Hs (usually promises at least 4 trumps)|pg||
mb|d|mb|3H|nt|fabsayc: i would like to see a good reason for guessing the diamonds|pg||
nt|lml: that is cruel|pg||
nt|buffytvs: don't think there is one -- but potentially Korbel could pick up a game swing here|pg||
nt|flash: would 4@C be a better description?   or would we need a @S honor and something more robust in @Ds for that??|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: it really is a coin toss|pg||
mb|4H|nt|flash: would a 3@D call be fit-showing?|pg||
nt|reisig: NS will likely find 5@c....then what?|pg||
nt|flash: would that be the best description??|pg||
mb|4S|nt|lml: no reason to go either way|pg||
mb|d|nt|starkist: maybe they'll lead one|pg||
nt|buffytvs: thids auction is different though -- West had a chnace to double 1@H as a passed hand -- so there are some inferences|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so failure to lead one is a clue|pg||
mb|5C|nt|buffytvs: failure to lead one from the ace when you have the @CKQ?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hey, all i have is straw|pg||
nt|lml: I think the clues are slim|pg||
nt|buffytvs: yes|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: in the end you go with your gut I suppose|pg||
nt|buffytvs: which one of them looks like they have it...|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: something like that|pg||
nt|fabsayc: use the oswald jacoby stare|pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: we can see that 5@Hs makes|pg||
nt|thurston:  best description of that hand would be a fit jump if partnership infected in that way but I like 4C splinter|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h2|nt|buffytvs: well we didn't consider that|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h3|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|sK|pc|s4|pg||
pc|sA|nt|starkist: now play for split aces|pg||
nt|reisig: Does Pass over 5@c show singleton?|pg||
pc|s7|nt|lml: here we come|pg||
nt|lml: I bet he gets it right|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s6|pg||
nt|buffytvs: so this will be either 5 or 6 IMPs to Korbel, and a slender lead to take to dinner|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sQ|nt|flash: i'm not sure that any choice would get the partnership to 5@H, but....|pg||
pc|c8|nt|thurston:  the route E chose works ok if opps cease and desist but they so rarely do anymore|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|d5|nt|buffytvs: oh no, we had dinner,m sorry -- into the 4th set|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
pc|cT|pc|h7|nt|flash: should be forcing, so 0 or 1??|pg||

nt|buffytvs: thx to our operator Susy, and all the commentators.  Hope you enjoyed it|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: one more set |pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: be back in 10-15 min|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 5 minute break, i think not|pg||
nt|buffytvs: probably 15-20 min|pg||
nt|reisig: I'd assume that|pg||
nt|flash: this worked out reasonably|pg||
