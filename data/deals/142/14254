nt|niclecuyer: yep |pg||
nt|flash: or just guess the @D position??|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes is that feasible|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: he can come to the spade A and try a low diamond |pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzjq: balcombe bid quick...the delay was the scribbling of the description of the redbl...|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjq: more scribbling by taylor...it looks like he is writing out their entire system regarding this bid...|pg||
pc|c6|nt|vugraphzjq: 4c showed 6+ clubs and 4 hearts|pg||
nt|buffytvs: maybe someone can suggest that tomorrow they do it the usual way so we can get comparisons much faster|pg||
pc|c2|nt|guppy: hmmmm....I wonder if they were on the same wavelength on this one?  Did Balcombe also alert? |pg||
pc|cT|pc|c8|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: i think they have different meanings for the 4c bid|pg||

nt|buffytvs: never have to say you're sorry,. right?|pg||

nt|lml: the lead is helpful|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d9|nt|guppy: Playing their strong 1@c methods, Judy's choice of opening bid essentially valued her solitary @d as an x rather than a K.  Some players wouldn't hesitate to have opened 1N (15-17) ...|pg||
nt|guppy: with her hand as a least of bad alternatives - which would have led to 3N declared from her side - possibly making on a normalish @s x opening lead|pg||

mb|1C|nt|niclecuyer: north will almost always bid either at first of second bid after 1Sp opening by W - why not bid first when you can? yes you can miss something but passing creates 0 problems|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|d3|pc|s4|nt|stewball: on this layout|pg||
nt|starkist: hard to shift to @d esp looking at the dummy|pg||

nt|buffytvs: yes :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: I dont think I would just bid game  ... you do need a fit|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: this hand we saw a brilliant discovery play in 3nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: well he did just bid game|pg||
nt|buffytvs: that works too -- Eats has a fine heart stopper|pg||
nt|buffytvs: and Gord has a source of tricks :)|pg||
nt|lml: spades break 4-4|pg||
nt|buffytvs: at least, he hopes it's a source of tricks|pg||
nt|lml: all is good|pg||
nt|lml: but they don't get style points|pg||
nt|lml: you need to get to 5@C to get 10/10 in the bidding contest|pg||
nt|buffytvs: if they lead a diamond, Piotr has to win it, else they can shift to spades in time|pg||
nt|lml: my guess is south will lead a spade|pg||
pc|hT|nt|lml: sigh|pg||
nt|buffytvs: well, that takes the pressure off|pg||
nt|buffytvs: but understandable|pg||
pc|h5|nt|guppy: this is a difficulkt hand for NS to restrain themselves from getting too high - at favourable vulnerability Taylor did remarkably well not stepping in immediately over 1@S |pg||

nt|fabsayc: after two rounds of clubs, second ducked, how do you proceed|pg||
pc|cK|pc|s4|pc|c2|pc|c9|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|lml: so 10 tricks at least|pg||
nt|lml: and really not much chance for more|pg||
pc|h8|pc|c4|nt|fabsayc: wolpert played a spade to ace and lead diamond jack|pg||
nt|fabsayc: when it was not covered he finessed spades, ran that suit and finessed in hearts|pg||
nt|fabsayc: effectively taking both red finesses to make the hand|pg||

nt|vugraphzjq: by the way, taylor and balcombe first played together in 1976 at a regional in Kingston|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: perhaps he decided to take heart finesse expecting other declarer to finesse in diamonds|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|guppy: Labouring as I am without the benefit of their partnership agreements, perhaps Nick's clues to passing Balcombe's 5@c were as follows: (a) she didn't open 1@c, and more importantly ...|pg||
nt|guppy: (b) she didn't XX|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|lml: a club lead would work well against 3NT but I dont see how you can find it from the east hand|pg||
nt|buffytvs: Ross really want to have a punt at 3NT|pg||
nt|lml: oh yes he does|pg||
nt|lml: but will he|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: yes  he is playing in his bidding box|pg||
nt|buffytvs: vulnerable with a good 5-card suit -- I say he will|pg||
nt|buffytvs: Colbert's Rule :)|pg||
nt|lml: me too|pg||
nt|buffytvs: look for reasons to bid, not excuses for not bidding|pg||
nt|lml: but 2NT said he had a very good hand|pg||
nt|lml: so its a what the heck bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: of he was soo disciplined|pg||
nt|buffytvs: discipine wins out|pg||
pc|s5|nt|buffytvs: I think he would have a poretty good shot at 3NT|pg||
nt|lml: yes, I suppose if he was going to bid 3NT he should have just done it in the first place|pg||
nt|buffytvs: even misguessing diamonds there are a lot of chances|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s6|pc|s8|pg||
nt|lml: a club lead would be tough though|pg||
pc|d9|nt|fabsayc: this may make|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dA|pc|d5|pg||
nt|lml: I guess not really he has 3 clubs|pg||
pc|dK|pc|c8|nt|guppy: Here's an example of where Nick G. accorded full value to his stiff @cK by treating his hand as 17-19 balanced with his 1@c then 1N sequence|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d6|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|nt|fabsayc: well done by gordon|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h4|pc|hK|pc|h7|pg||

nt|flash: 2@C natural and limited (they apparently don't include stiff Queens in hand evaluation|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: even so, KQJxxx with AKQx along is huge|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|caitlin: too strong|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|nt|starkist: will be starting from scratch tommorrow|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|caitlin: for 2@C as evidenced by not getting to 4@H|pg||
nt|3for3: perhaps 3@H over 3@C...|pg||
nt|flash: 6 IMPs to Gartaganis on Board 30, so they'll retain the lead after this board|pg||
nt|dannymiles: So appears today's 64 boards were basically for not. |pg||
nt|caitlin: good practice:)|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|guppy: The key to this successful defence was Taylor's duck of the S!K, severing declarer's communications....simple yet devastatingly effective|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|mb|1S|mb|d|nt|fabsayc: very tough slam to bid, but starting with 2@C may work|pg||
mb|3C|nt|lml: 4@S|pg||
nt|buffytvs: yes -- the ultimate save -- one that makes :)|pg||
nt|lml: this is the type of hand that leads to double game swings|pg||
nt|lml: big boards|pg||
nt|buffytvs: certainly does|pg||
mb|4H|nt|lml: I think this will be played north south but maybe one too high|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: and Ross is thinking, can he have two black aces and four hearts and I';m cold for 6?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: 3@H P 4@D cue bid should get this done|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lml: I think Piotr had to get the diamond bid in to get the save|pg||
nt|lml: /make|pg||
nt|buffytvs: tough to judge EW|pg||
nt|lml: good board for Korbel though|pg||
nt|lml: maybe a very good board|pg||
nt|buffytvs: no great distribution and few high cards|pg||
nt|buffytvs: certainly hard to see them losing IMPs here|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c2|pc|c7|pg||
nt|fabsayc: oops, the semi-fatal 1430 convention|pg||
nt|buffytvs: this could, as you said, easily be a double game swing|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|pc|hA|pc|h9|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: discussion re bid meanings |pg||
nt|buffytvs: a 3@D fit jump from East, if available, might do the trick|pg||
pc|hK|nt|lml: yes|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h5|pc|h3|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|fabsayc: the % play is two finesses, but here only one entry so take discard and play heart ace|pg||
pc|c5|nt|buffytvs: but equal colours, it's really hard to see from either hand|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|nt|vugraphzjq: the last hand nick did not open 1NT, so he was marked to not hold the club queen|pg||
mb|1S|nt|fabsayc: operator, what is this 2@D bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|buffytvs: in the OR, they found the deadly trump lead against 5@C, and declarer just sort of ran out of tricks|pg||
mb|3C|nt|vugraphzjq: not sure, think opening with d|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzjq: opener|pg||
nt|fabsayc: probably win in hand and finesse diamonds|pg||

pc|c7|pc|c8|pc|cK|pg||

nt|vugraphzjq: a martini?|pg||
nt|buffytvs: several probably|pg||
nt|lml: ice cream ... martini ... ice cream ... martini ... so hard to pick|pg||
nt|buffytvs: they have a lot in common -- hard to have just one|pg||
nt|lml: I think Macdonalds is closed ... does that answer the question|pg||
nt|buffytvs: they never close -- 24/7 up the road from us|pg||
nt|lml: that was figurative not literal|pg||
nt|lml: so far I feel that Korbel has had the best of the set|pg||
nt|lml: it seems like Gartaganis is a bit tired.  What do you think?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: i lost the play it went so slow|pg||

nt|vugraphzjq: Director Bev Ross is telling Judy all her options, |pg||
nt|lml: from Judy's hand it should play better from Nick's side|pg||
nt|buffytvs: Confucius say 'man who lead of turn does not know what to lead -- accept it'|pg||
nt|lml: and a spade lead is hardly frignthening|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: Judy is thinking of accepting and letting Nick play the hand|pg||
nt|buffytvs: out of turn|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: will bbo let me do this?|pg||
nt|lml: that is a good question !|pg||
nt|buffytvs: lol -- it might not -- you might have to change the auction|pg||
nt|buffytvs: there's a thought -- Fred needs to give operators an override for this situation|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: I will wait until  the first trick is played as Nick is now the declarer,  Someoe please tell Fred and Uday we need a new feature on bbo|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: at the other table the spade nine was also led, Wolpert ducked a club, a spade was continued and wolpert went back to clubs and claimed 5|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: just a matter of overtricks if the Defense can find a diamond shift in time|pg||

pc|c5|pc|h3|pc|h4|nt|vugraphzjq: ah but Nick played diamonds first|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I think Nick's looking for a red suit squeeze|pg||
nt|buffytvs: or a dbl|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: I'll predict an imp goes to the Korbelian Squad here|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|buffytvs: this will work -- he sets up a club by force, and East will have to break a pointed suit|pg||
pc|s4|nt|lml: yes team Korbel did well on this hand|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lml: I dont think there is a squeeze|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s9|pg||
nt|buffytvs: if he exited the @SQ, declarer would win with the king, then play spades into the safe hand, setting up trick 8|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pc|s7|nt|guppy: On Board  20 in the Open Roon Daniel Korbel did open 1N (15-17) on the hand where Judy ignored her singleton @dK....propelling his side to "touch and go" 5@c that he managed to ...|pg||

pc|c6|nt|buffytvs: Keith's offering to play 2@C, but I don't think Ross will want to|pg||

nt|vugraphzjq: Klimo in the other room found the jack of spades by running the ten first chance he got, to make his 2 overtricks|pg||

mb|p|nt|lml: if you play the range you should make the bid|pg||

nt|lml: and besides in all our years of weak notrump only one player ever got us|pg||
nt|buffytvs: only one pair in fact|pg||

pc|h5|pg||
pc|h4|nt|buffytvs: with a stiff club in dummy, and a trump lead unattractive, she may well lead a spade |pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: spotlight on Judy to find the spade lead now|pg||
nt|lml: I dont think a heart lead is very attractive.  Its possible she might|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hJ|nt|lml: yes we are on the same page|pg||
nt|lml: but then again she could lead anything|pg||
nt|lml: a lot of imps on one decision|pg||

nt|lml: wow!|pg||
nt|buffytvs: 26 IMPs swing total here on one card -- and she's a winner|pg||
nt|lml: good for her|pg||
nt|guppy: bravo - well reasoned by Judy|pg||
nt|lml: Keith has no choice at all|pg||
nt|buffytvs: as long as Nick returns a heart right away of course|pg||
nt|lml: I do remember that we got Paul Soloway and his client|pg||
nt|buffytvs: actually, Kit Woolsey and Ed Manfield got us once too -- cost us a Spingold match if I recall correctly|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h9|pc|hT|nt|lml: yes he has to find the right ace to cash but then a heart is more likely to go away|pg||
nt|buffytvs: he will guess they're off an ace though, since no-one tried for 7|pg||
nt|lml: so that might be a hint|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: Nick and Judy play 4th best leads so I doubt there is anything in the 2 for suit preference|pg||
nt|lml: the fact that the club shortness encouraged balcome suggests he has some club length|pg||
nt|guppy: Nick has to find @h return....perhaps Judy's spot card perhaps could have been higher ...|pg||
nt|lml: I must have blotted it out|pg||
pc|hA|pg||

pc|c3|nt|lml: I dont think I would read a lot into the spot card|pg||
nt|lml: but lots of work to do|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I was about to say -- a curious hand, both side can make 1NT.  Typical on flat 20-20's.  That's why you have to get the bid in first|pg||
nt|buffytvs: though here, the defence have 3 tricks in; seem like they should have time get one more in each suit|pg||
nt|lml: what is taking the time on this trick|pg||

nt|niclecuyer: heart 8?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not sufficient is true, but neither will this line|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: don't they play upside down?|pg||
nt|flash: (discard a @H when showing out of @Ds and maybe declarer won't notice...)|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: aaahh highly technical observation :)|pg||
pc|dT|nt|flash: Smith Echo?|pg||

pc|dJ|pc|s2|pc|d4|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c6|pg||
nt|czyzyk: They play rev Smith and udca|pg||
nt|caitlin: I would think so, very popular|pg||
nt|caitlin: smith echo lets you tell pd if you like opening lead; or if pd led to find his pd, to let person on lead to give attitude to opening lead|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: love it personally - my recent partners play standard and I have to think all the time (which is usually bad)|pg||
nt|caitlin: with smith echo, when declarer gets in a HIGH card in declarer's suit says I like opening lead; with reverse smith a LOW card says I liked the lead|pg||
nt|caitlin: www.bridgeguys.com a great place to look up these useful ways of communicating with pd on defense and loads of conventions|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: Darren must be in a trance here - hard to know what to do|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: darren just thinking|pg||
nt|stewball: he wants his @h 8 back|pg||
nt|vugraphzjs: asked judy a Q|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: maybe he is thinking about the chicken feet soup we had in Yokohama some years ago|pg||
nt|caitlin: heart lead seems best by default|pg||
nt|starkist: they have it in timmies now|pg||

nt|buffytvs: All four of these people are really pleasant to play against|pg||
nt|buffytvs: nice manners at the table|pg||
nt|lml: on 20-20|pg||
nt|buffytvs: that's where the lead comes in|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: these boards offered a lot of opportunities for big swings|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but janicki would have needed to get them all right|pg||
nt|lml: that bid gives Taylor a problem|pg||
nt|buffytvs: For anyone who doesn't know him, you can follow Ross Taylor's blog on www.bridgeblogging.com|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: 2@C may also have a 4-card major|pg||
nt|buffytvs: he writes about poker as well as bridge -- and very well too|pg||
nt|buffytvs: a sketchy 3NT here, that really needed the diamonds to come in for some tricks|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|lml: you hate passing but there is always next round|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I don't think Keith will pass\|pg||
nt|lml: Balcombe will make it easy now|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: 2@C also shows 2 of top 3 honours, or 3 of top 5|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: ok i know what 2@D was now|pg||
nt|lml: Nick is not going to take this too far|pg||
nt|buffytvs: so how high will they go?  Par looks to be 5@S making NS|pg||
nt|lml: do you remember the 3NT down 2 early on with the 6-5 red suit hand|pg||
nt|lml: it was a push|pg||
nt|buffytvs: in 4@S or 3NT?|pg||
nt|lml: North opened 2@H at both tables|pg||
nt|buffytvs: that was Bd 21|pg||
mb|2N|nt|lml: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: or rather 4@S making 5|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: the score for the half on compared boards at this time is 17-16|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I see Judy found a raise to 3@H and Darren was endplayed into bidding 3NT|pg||
mb|d|nt|fabsayc: in precision system, the 1@D opening is ambigous as to length|pg||
nt|lml: 4@C is too high|pg||
nt|lml: thats 500|pg||
nt|lml: 5@H|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|buffytvs: I like the call though|pg||
nt|buffytvs: so that one is safely scored up as far as Gartaganis is concerned, and now they have to worry about 24|pg||
mb|3C|nt|buffytvs: pushed them to the 5-level|pg||
nt|lml: yes it is low cost way to get them up|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: but its enough now!|pg||
nt|buffytvs: Ross doesn't believe the 5-level belongs to the opponents, obviously|pg||
nt|lml: now they have to guess diamonds|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: Keith will need to find the @DQ, does he play Nick who holds 4 or Judy who opened the bidding?|pg||
nt|buffytvs: as long as the defence ruffs out the @C10|pg||
nt|lml: you can go either way |pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: well I guess east wanted a diamond lead but he wasnt getting one|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: we use to play 1@D followed by 2@C showed real clubs, not necissarily diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: he knows Judy has about 10 cards in the round suits...|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: yes good point|pg||
mb|3D|nt|fabsayc: so there is a need for a way to show primary diamonds, and that is the 2@D opening|pg||
nt|lml: he will think about it a while|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|lml: they are moving in to worse contract here|pg||
nt|buffytvs: this can't be thinker for East surely?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|s9|nt|buffytvs: well I think we can safely say that EW are going plus here|pg||
nt|lml: well they landed somewhere that east-west can beat|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lml: West knows where the @SJ is so one presumes he is thinking about what to do later in the hand|pg||
pc|sA|nt|vugraphzjq: they are short for time|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|buffytvs: beating it 1 is not a problem -- beating it more may be tougher|pg||
nt|buffytvs: playing hearts might work out best for the defence|pg||
nt|lml: I think this is likely one down|pg||
nt|lml: but it is complicated|pg||
pc|s7|pc|h3|pc|d6|nt|buffytvs: how long do they have left?|pg||
nt|lml: I am going to guess he will get it wrong|pg||
nt|lml: invoking the commentator's curse rule|pg||
nt|lml: if he gets it wrong Judy will have won the board|pg||
nt|buffytvs: Keith's  a very good declarer -- don't bet against him|pg||
nt|lml: its not that|pg||
nt|lml: its that Nick has the diamond length clearly|pg||
nt|buffytvs: yes -- but this is almost a table feel thing|pg||
nt|lml: and there is enough for him to hold a queen|pg||
nt|buffytvs: he does hold a queen :)|pg||
nt|lml: Judy wouldnt value the heart queen|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lml: diamond queen|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lml: that works fine for the defence|pg||
pc|h6|nt|buffytvs: nobody's going to throw a diamond and help him|pg||
nt|lml: the high heart might have helped though|pg||
nt|buffytvs: if you blieve it :)|pg||
nt|lml: now it looks like Nick has the @HQ|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: yes when the D has the declarer booked, all bets are off|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|hT|nt|buffytvs: i think tapping declarer in hearts might end up with 2 down|pg||
nt|lml: at this point they have 3 in and the @CA and @DQ and a spade overruff|pg||
nt|lml: down 2|pg||
nt|buffytvs: yes|pg||
nt|lml: its easier to see now|pg||
nt|buffytvs: sorry -- was trying to respond to kibitzers and lost track of where they were in the play|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|pc|c2|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c4|pc|cK|nt|lml: we are coming close to the moment of truth|pg||
nt|buffytvs: if he plays three spades, he sort of squeezes Nick into discarding his @HQ|pg||
nt|lml: and Keith knows a lot of imps are riding on this decision|pg||
nt|lml: another spade or two ... why not|pg||
nt|buffytvs: if he sees the @HQ he'll go right in diamonds I think|pg||
nt|lml: well I was right about it taking a long time to decide|pg||
nt|buffytvs: 2 more bds -- how long do they have, David?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: 12 minutes to go|pg||
nt|lml: you are cancelling out the commentator's curse... you say he will and I say he wont|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: this is Andy Stark by the way, David's on a smoke break|pg||
nt|buffytvs: hi Andy :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: :)|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|nt|lml: board 31 is very good for Gartaganis|pg||

pc|s8|nt|lml: they will want to get it|pg||
nt|lml: in|pg||
nt|lml: on Board 23 for Gartaganis gives them the lead back|pg||
nt|buffytvs: yes that's the one we thought Ross might bid it, but he passed out 3@D|pg||
pc|c7|nt|buffytvs: we thought you would probably make it|pg||
pc|d8|pc|s6|pg||
nt|lml: well I was right .. he went with the length|pg||

pc|h9|pc|h5|pc|hQ|pc|d2|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d9|pc|d5|pc|s2|pg||
mc|7|nt|buffytvs: but Korbel could get it right back on 24 if they find the (making) save over 4@H|pg||
nt|lml: so despite our feeling that Korbel had the best of it - it hasnt really worked out that way|pg||
pg||
qx|o31|st||md|1S9765HJ873DAT9C74,ST32HAKT4DKQ63CK8,SAQ8HQ6D542CQJT53,SKJ4H952DJ87CA962|sv|n|nt|caitlin: it's easy for us to see that Korbel did not assume his pd had @HQ|pg||
nt|fabsayc: that is the main factor, everybody on fumes|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|caitlin: but not so easy from Korbel's point of view and he just wants to defeat it|pg||
nt|flash: 11-13; forcing stayman|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|niclecuyer: this hand cold for 7 hard to believe on such limited values|pg||
nt|flash: or something more esoteric?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|caitlin: I thought forcing stayman went out a zillion years ago:)|pg||
nt|dannymiles: Korbel's pard discouraged hearts; switch the @hQ and @sQ and give declarer a third club and we'd all laugh at a heart return when you have a guaranteed down 1|pg||
nt|czyzyk: Can they get to 6?|pg||
nt|caitlin: forcing stayman is 2@D: non forcing 2@C|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: 100% with you Dan|pg||
mb|4S|nt|fabsayc: it resides in eastern canada|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|caitlin: ok Martin|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: wow - really costly to try 4D?|pg||
nt|stewball: they dont play it like eastern canada|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|niclecuyer: could be I guess - it could angle them towardsa damaging club lead|pg||
nt|stewball: eatern canada would respond 2@s|pg||
nt|flash: it's far superior to xfers over weak NT...   and still played over strong NTs by some East of the Plains...|pg||
nt|stewball: eastern|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|pc|hA|pg||

nt|caitlin: as did everyone at the club|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|mc|13|nt|vugraphzjs: bathroom break|pg||
nt|caitlin: it never hurts to cue bid along the way.|pg||
nt|caitlin: In this kind of situation where North has very good hand.|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: could have bought Jxx KQJx Jxx Kxx and the club lead could be disastrous but still - they might find it anyway|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: Judy would have driven to slam on her own after 4D I think, 4 trumps, max and great clubs|pg||
nt|caitlin: you have to assume they will find the holes regardless|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: I agree with you|pg||
nt|starkist: 5 loser and 9 card fit|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: seems a little pessimistic to "just" bid 4Sp - would love to have a non serious cue bid situation in 3NT but that would surely have been a suggestion to play 3NT|pg||
pg||

nt|vugraphzjq: thank you|pg||
nt|fabsayc: finals start tomorrow at too early an hour for me, continue on saturday|pg||
nt|lml: the double game swing hand .. yes|pg||
mb|1N|nt|lml: 6@S isnt a bad spot here|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: and here's a magic fit slam|pg||
nt|lml: so a swing chance|pg||
mb|2D|an|forcing stayman|nt|buffytvs: i think he should have played more spades -- cannot cost, and in fact he gets an inteersting piece of information|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: There's a deal in 'Bridge behind Bars' like that|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: 2@H could be up to 11(ish) HCPs|pg||
nt|lml: as you can see this is a good score for the dark blue team|pg||
nt|buffytvs: the strong clubbers couldn't get there -- let's see whether 2/1 can do it|pg||
mb|3C|an|4432|nt|buffytvs: seems very unlikely|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: I guess they bid 3@D with both majors and longer diamonds|pg||
mb|3S|nt|buffytvs: Declarer knows South is 4-0 or 0-4 in the mnajors, and needs to find the @SQ|pg||
mb|p|nt|buffytvs: he runs everything and forces South to discard a heart, after which he can play North for the @SQ|pg||
nt|lml: we may be ducplicating the result though|pg||
nt|lml: so he is trying for the slam|pg||
nt|buffytvs: costs nothing|pg||
nt|lml: but Ross wont love his spade suit|pg||
mb|4C|nt|buffytvs: Ross will hate his trumps but like his controls|pg||
nt|lml: 4@C is a good bid for Keith|pg||
nt|lml: they could get there|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: but Ross is bid out,,, its really up to Balcombe|pg||
nt|buffytvs: I think they will|pg||
nt|buffytvs: but he has to go now -- biding 4@D isn't going to get him anywhere, and he knows that|pg||
mb|4D|nt|lml: no Nick wont pass a taekout double and he didnt|pg||
nt|vugraphzjq: smooth pass from KB|pg||
nt|lml: Balcome likes clubs!|pg||
nt|lml: if he bids 4@D then Ross will just sign off I would think|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: I dont see how Ross can bid any more than 4@S|pg||
mb|4S|nt|buffytvs: ohh|pg||
nt|lml: its okay... it doesnt matter|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: its a little birdy hand cheep cheep cheep|pg||
nt|buffytvs: ah yes-- didn't see the result in the other room|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|buffytvs: he has to but then Keith will know there's no @HK opposite|pg||
nt|lml: he was endplayed|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h4|nt|lml: tough auction |pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|pg||
nt|lml: I see your point though|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|s3|nt|fabsayc: usually 1nt bidder has clubs|pg||
nt|buffytvs: yes, but I'm trying to put 13 points in the south hand (4432) which don;t give him a play for slam|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c2|pc|cQ|nt|buffytvs: haven't been able to yet|pg||
nt|lml: since Taylor did not cuebid hearts it suggests his points are elsewhere|pg||
mc|12|nt|buffytvs: right -- so which 13 with no @HK would be bad?|pg||
nt|lml: so a lost opportunity|pg||

mb|d|nt|vugraphzjq: the RDBl shows 4+ hearts|pg||

nt|niclecuyer: he is bound to get the diamonds wrong|pg||
