mb|p|mb|4H|nt|daman: Hi David|pg||
mb|4S|nt|brolucius: 4@H very reasonable, although not everyone's choice.|pg||
mb|5H|nt|daman: I like 4@H    es[pecially as an opening salvo to the opps|pg||
nt|brolucius: Clearly too good for 3@H.|pg||
nt|daman: now    5@H would not be on my radar as West|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h4|pc|h7|pc|hA|nt|rnmalik: 4@H reasonable and off by 1, whereas 4@S would have made|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer can discard one club on the diamonds, finessing twice, so needs to guess the clubs.|pg||
nt|daman: the @C guess is easy|pg||
pc|s5|nt|daman: East would not open 4@H with 2 aces     as a rule|pg||

nt|dohicky: Hi all|pg||
nt|eamongall: methinks its the wrong hand|pg||
nt|dohicky: Looks like it|pg||
nt|eamongall: i see a score of 3@Hs+4 in another match but same board ...also bizarre|pg||
nt|eamongall: the bidding here is possible but  aggressive and the 1@S opening is strange|pg||
nt|cicus: a brave entry by David, which has been left unpunished|pg||

nt|cicus: I don't think so|pg||

mb|4H|nt|lestergold: without a spade lead/[layed by south it may make|pg||
mb|p|nt|pdjourdain: might declarer read this and drop the king?|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: It looks like 4 clubs, three spades and 1 trick in each other, but not easy timing|pg||
nt|cicus: I think 2@S or even 3 making|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: Murdoch has correctly downvalued his two bacl Qx is|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: n/s have been playing together for around 40 years|pg||

nt|hawe45:  Et lÂ´entame aussi|pg||
pc|c2|nt|lestergold: yes i was expecting a further effort fromN/S but they are ta ufavouravle and south's hand was rightly devalued|pg||

nt|szalay: new format of EC is really disadvanteg for them, I believe|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes may well be|pg||
nt|szalay: some kibs asked why its problem to be over 60+|pg||
nt|brolucius: What is the change in format, then?|pg||
nt|roswolf: stamina|pg||
nt|szalay: no intelligence is the problem|pg||

nt|szalay: btw I've  just injured today...hope will recover till Ostende:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: some seniors are ultra aggressive the German doctors are an example|pg||
nt|brolucius: That is why Bob Hamman has always amazed me. How he can play at that level at his age is incredible. |pg||

nt|dohicky: taken|pg||
nt|qwikjanz: Interesting hansd - right play in spades is somewhat dependant on how aggressive a multi is played|pg||
nt|dohicky: A fairly heavy defeat about 30-40 imps|pg||
nt|lestergold: opps couldnt get at their 4 tricks single dummy|pg||

mb|1N|nt|lestergold: 3N makes 9 top tricks wikth the clubs breaking|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|barnets: so england are now in the lead ?|pg||
nt|dohicky: I would guess so, i don't know the other scores and the website hasn't been updated|pg||
nt|lestergold: but with a combined 23 game not that likely to be bid 5@d might run into difficulties with spades 4/2|pg||
nt|lestergold: will Greenwood back in here no!|pg||
nt|sheila a: EW look to be able to make game here, possibly|pg||
nt|santyclz: But still an opening for NIBU.|pg||
mb|2H|nt|dohicky: it wasnt a multi :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: mind you 4@s loses 2@s and a club|pg||
nt|cicus: strange that E is not bidding his spades|pg||
nt|lestergold: east can show both suits like this|pg||
nt|cicus: spade length is concealed or strength overvalued later|pg||
nt|lestergold: was not a 3@d overfcall avaiolabkle to west|pg||
mb|p|nt|pdjourdain: another Multi and N must bid his void!|pg||
nt|qwikjanz: N sitting there hoping opps will bid :)|pg||
nt|dohicky: I'm told by the cbai president that it was a 24 imp loss for 19/11|pg||
nt|chick: NS play a weak NT system, as you can see|pg||
nt|ritong: 3@d a l américaine|pg||
mb|p|nt|sheila a: W was obviously put off by the vulnerability|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: 4@h cold this may be expensve|pg||
nt|sheila a: Hoped that partner would be short in @c and able to re-open|pg||
pc|s3|nt|cicus: but it may well go in accordance with their agreements|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3N also cold as south can establish but not menjpy his clubs|pg||
nt|ritong: cette affaire la va mal tourner|pg||
nt|doctorone: pas une partie de plaisir ce contrat :)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|pdjourdain: Declarer should scramble 8 or 9 tricks|pg||
nt|doctorone: 3@d montre probablement une invitation a la manche avec 3 atouts sans singleton|pg||
pc|s4|nt|sheila a: a @s lead causes more problems|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|barnets: the x  for the lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: his hand in my opinion is too good to put that amolunt of pressure on his partner at unfaviourable|pg||
nt|lestergold: i predict this will cost them a lot of imps|pg||
nt|ritong: le contrat sera sans doute le meme dans l autre salle|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lestergold: well west has chanced game and they will egt an excellent result for their optimism|pg||
nt|cicus: not a particularly good game as both minors should break|pg||
nt|lestergold: west knows hia Ks in partner's two suits are working well however his er club stop four to the eight is perhaps not that robust|pg||
nt|cicus: by choosing X as his first call, E has practically endplayed his side into game|pg||
nt|lestergold: very robust wehn opps cl;ubs are breaking tho 4/4|pg||
nt|lestergold: i like that ides of being ebdplayed into game!!|pg||
nt|cicus: game is about 25 %|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4@s tho was much sounder as it makes even when clubs do not break as long as dims break and spades no worse than 4/2|pg||
nt|cicus: you need 38 % for vul games so it is not that poor|pg||
nt|santyclz: Nice distribution.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Double-dummy, E/W gagne 3 SA = les cartes mal placÃ© pour 2 @H|pg||
pc|h8|nt|pdjourdain: He can ruff all three spades|pg||
nt|barnets: i think it takes a club lead to beat 6@S|pg||
nt|dohicky: England beat NI 25/5|pg||
nt|barnets: interesting play in 6|pg||
nt|dohicky: yes|pg||

mb|p|nt|lestergold: 3n no play|pg||
mb|1D|nt|lestergold: coffee break hand|pg||
nt|sheila a: N's hand isn't ideal for NT but it seems the pragmatic choice|pg||
nt|lestergold: normal effort id say|pg||
nt|lestergold: but e/w will play spade part socre i expect|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|cicus: light but normal X by E|pg||
nt|lestergold: n/s play game in  hearts only losing a couple of trump tricks|pg||
nt|santyclz: 1nt in 4th seat?|pg||
mb|p|nt|pdjourdain: Likely 1NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2@c some kind of lebensohl?|pg||
nt|chick: EW play a strong 1@C with 1@D negative|pg||
nt|simonr: An amorphous Precison 1@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|dohicky: Making 3NT looks quite possibly given the @s position|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: but this is OK|pg||
nt|barnets: anyway 8 to ireland on board 1|pg||
nt|lestergold: obviously diamond bid shoing hearts and values|pg||
nt|cicus: transfers have become very popular after intervention - even without|pg||
nt|simonr: They play a strong NT |pg||
nt|ritong: gagné|pg||
nt|doctorone: lol|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|pdjourdain: East should bid 1S in case West has both majors|pg||
nt|dohicky: West would have opened 2@c with both majors so that isn't really possible|pg||
nt|ritong: 2 ou 3 @ds?|pg||
pc|d4|nt|lestergold: oh maybe this is not a coffee hand after all maybe the coffee wil get spilt|pg||
nt|lestergold: north will now like his hand its very slammish|pg||
nt|lestergold: i have a suit to bid but my hand not good enuf to try for a game|pg||
nt|chick: unfortunately, when opener has diamonds, the strong hand is revealed as dummy, making the defense much easier|pg||
nt|doctorone: 3@d venait bien, je crois|pg||
nt|ritong: 3@d montrerait un 5+/5+ de manche  levy estime que ses couleurs sont un peu creuses, sans doute|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lestergold: perhaps|pg||
nt|simonr: @D lead and club switch unlikely|pg||
nt|santyclz: I sometimes open 14 high 1nt's in 4th when no 4-card major.|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|lestergold: im nio expert on their system|pg||
nt|simonr: but spades are not carrying their full weight. AQJx is better|pg||
nt|santyclz: Try to keep the opps out.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Pour battre 1 @H il faut entamer @S|pg||
pc|d7|nt|dohicky: at least 4/4|pg||
nt|barnets: declarer is worried about losing 4@C tricks and a @D|pg||
nt|barnets: but that is not going to happen|pg||
nt|simonr: Safe neutral lead|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|nt|sheila a: I guess W could have said something else to indicate a different hand type (ie if he was stronger)|pg||
nt|lestergold: suggested that it is capelleti|pg||
nt|lestergold: single msuiter basically|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: interesting whether oppo know East would not show spades|pg||
nt|barnets: today anyway :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: south should sign off now knwoing that his great dim vaslues buy a singlteon opposite and his hearts arec not that great|pg||
nt|cicus: N would have done better splintering with 4@Ds|pg||
nt|cicus: if it does not show a void in their methods|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes but effectively he did at the 5 level but partner soldiered on into the valley of death|pg||
nt|lestergold: charge of the l;ight brigade the hearts being rather light|pg||
nt|chick: with such a nice fit, and knowing where all the high cards are, this should make overtricks|pg||
nt|simonr: Singleton 10 of @H will aid declarer|pg||
nt|doctorone: beaucoup moins simple qu'en apparence ce contrat... |pg||
nt|ritong: ou que sa force globale est un peu juste|pg||

pc|h3|pc|hA|nt|pdjourdain: Wales in wrong partscore on Board 1 cost 6|pg||

mb|3H|mb|p|nt|szalay: the real issue here is: will East move from 3N or not?|pg||
nt|roswolf: no nut with the young Bessis they will surely get there eventually|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|szalay: but their team failed, I think|pg||

mb|2D|mb|p|nt|pdjourdain: Strong club 1@D|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/w can make 3@h n/s only two spades|pg||

nt|hawe45:  Pauvre Ouest - mais il fournit suffisamment pour gagner 4 @S|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|ritong: ?|pg||
mb|3C|nt|sheila a: there is debate as to whether you should play penalty doubles over a strong NT|pg||
nt|sheila a: if you don't it can be hard to let partner know you have a really good hand|pg||
nt|simonr: Straight forward auction to 3NT and should be a simple make|pg||
nt|ritong: ah:)|pg||
nt|doctorone: c mieux :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|pdjourdain: dble shows 3 hearts|pg||
nt|eamongall: looks like one off to me in 4@S |pg||

mb|p|mb|3H|nt|pdjourdain: should just make|pg||
nt|dohicky: I wonder would NS have found 4@h|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - et Volcker aussi?|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: this was vey well done n/s|pg||
nt|barnets: to scor their plus|pg||
nt|barnets: and reach the par contract|pg||
nt|barnets: it was tempting for both north and south to take different actions|pg||
nt|lestergold: lucky to find his partner with spades and a few meagre values if east had this instead he could be walking into penalty territory|pg||
nt|simonr: Too early for that - not yet dark here is Wales|pg||
nt|santyclz: It's Sunday, noon is late enough.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|lestergold: well he has done a lot of bidding ion his 16 count and bad spades|pg||

nt|ritong: donc, volcker joue SON systeme|pg||
nt|hawe45:  DÂ´accord|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|cicus: this is fool-proof against any distribution, E will have to play on spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: one off|pg||

nt|lestergold: ok but oe off|pg||
mb|4S|nt|hawe45:  Voila|pg||

mb|p|nt|lestergold: dims ruff heart switch cant get the heart loser away as east can ruff in|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: impeccable|pg||
pc|c4|nt|pdjourdain: declarer loses 1@S, 2@H, 1@D, and 1@C|pg||
nt|simonr: 1NT was 15-17 at all vuls and positions - can contain a range of shapes though.|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|pc|c7|pg||
nt|lestergold: makes a profit as e/w can make 140 but vwey eisky in my opinion|pg||

pc|dK|pc|d6|pc|d5|pc|dA|pg||

mb|p|nt|eamongall: dunno what the contract is going to be here ,,, maybe low level @Hs EW |pg||
nt|lestergold: well ineresting situation hedre|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: difficult hand to bid here|pg||
nt|simonr: 4@h by E/W looks the spot - may not get there though|pg||
mb|1D|nt|pdjourdain: The singleton 9 of spades helps declarer in 4S|pg||
nt|eamongall: maybe 3@Ds can slip thru via @H ruff|pg||
nt|barnets: Scotland overbid the last board to 4@H with no values and are playing it xd|pg||
nt|lestergold: the eight card major fit is off due to the bad heart break but 4@s is cold|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: another not-so-nice fitting hand|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: strong club|pg||
mb|1S|nt|simonr: Weak NT - what transfer breaks do they play? And will West accept?|pg||
nt|ritong: tout ça va finir a 3SA, l entame risque d etre difficile|pg||
nt|doctorone: en route vers un 3SA delicat maintenant|pg||
mb|p|nt|eamongall: hard for Brian Short to stop at 2N|pg||
nt|barnets: this is down 1 as is 3@H|pg||
nt|eamongall: and if he plays NT it might only be 5 tricks for declarer|pg||
nt|Walddk5: You are invisible|pg||
mb|2S|nt|dohicky: With both AQs offside 3@h looks to be -1 |pg||
nt|cicus: also 3NT|pg||

nt|eamongall: I don't think it will be more David if at all|pg||
nt|dohicky:  you might be able to get a an extra @C and @d eventually|pg||
nt|eamongall: but opps will be at least 6 tricks by then |pg||
nt|vugraphzdv: declarer looking at a,9@s and QJ5 @h in dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphzdv: trick 4 all at moment|pg||
nt|doctorone: si c'est N qui joue, une entame a @s sera probable|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk10: Welcome to Vladimir Ivanov|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: but 4@S is best as @D may break unevenly|pg||

mb|2S|nt|dohicky: Seems like an easy enough 4@s|pg||
nt|eamongall: seems to be about enough to assemble a 3NT contract for NS |pg||
nt|eamongall: 4@S will do also and maybe safer |pg||
nt|lestergold: caps lock agin sorry|pg||
nt|cicus: however I dislike opening 1NT with 5cM, I have to admit that it works most of the time|pg||
nt|lestergold: I think instinctively we all dislike having to open a no trump with taght sort of hand i think it is a matter of partnership style and preference|pg||
nt|sheila a: 4@s makes here when the @d come in|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: 14-16 NT in 4th seat this is too strong|pg||

mb|p|nt|eamongall: the scots getting a little high now |pg||
nt|lestergold: well now we have a no trump openiong with a 4225 which is not a balnced hand in my opionion|pg||
nt|lestergold: the double fit may encourage game to be bid same ten tricks in the spade 5/2 fit as the dim 5/4 fit tho|pg||
nt|simonr: Support raise - not sure if forcing to 3@S or game in their system|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: perhaps E's opening will keep NS from bidding 6|pg||
nt|ritong: apres avoir passé initialement|pg||
mb|p|pc|hK|nt|dohicky: Could be tough to stay out of slam now|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: Drury response but it doesn't have 3@H?|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: Sorry, when I partner Gary he has to play 14-16 in fourth as well!|pg||

nt|doctorone: 5@s parait clair au nom de la distribution et du complement a @h|pg||
pc|hA|nt|pdjourdain: Most now bid 2S rather than 2C though not the French!|pg||
nt|eamongall: no major pitfalls when the long trump chap has 4333|pg||
nt|eamongall: and the lead scoops out the @DK location |pg||

nt|pdjourdain: I didn't realise spades was a minor suit:)|pg||
nt|chick: just for today :)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|eamongall: and some @Hs too ...this double has multi functions|pg||
nt|barnets: now 5@C|pg||
nt|eamongall: vulnerability will not stop Walker ..|pg||
nt|eamongall: at least I typed before auction ended|pg||
nt|cicus: all my Drury sequences follow this course|pg||
nt|doctorone: A et R de @c a l'entame clarifieront la place des heonneurs manquants|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h6|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: And Wales has the best of Boards 15 and 16|pg||
nt|lestergold: note that even with both finesses wrong and a heart lead a ht discarder on club and third heart ruffed in dummy would make the contract|pg||
nt|ritong: les deux mises en main sont possibles|pg||
nt|ritong: faut décider qui a le roi de @s|pg||
nt|doctorone: NS sont autorise a joue 3@h sur la donne dans l ' autre salle|pg||

nt|ritong: les neuf, on les voit bien|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|eamongall: bugger ..Mesbur for once bid quicker then I type |pg||
nt|ritong: 3@d est une légère distorsion, ça correspond plus a cinq @ds et 4 @ss|pg||
nt|ritong: mais bon, il avait neuf cartes au total dans les deux couleurs:)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|eamongall: Normally I will by 1 minute |pg||
nt|eamongall: I win ..|pg||
nt|barnets: so we dont get to see if n/s would find th lead to beat 6@C|pg||
nt|eamongall: one off ...is not bad if one is not finding the @D lead |pg||
nt|lestergold: and may well followm this line as a precaution in any case|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: Surely South doubled this too|pg||
nt|ritong: et françois pourrait regretter son pessimisme|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c5|pg||
nt|lestergold: looks like it|pg||
nt|chick: only down 2, but a disaster Vul|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|barnets: yes would thye bid 6@S ? over 6@C |pg||
nt|dohicky:  Probably just 10 tricks now |pg||
pc|c3|pc|c8|pc|h7|pg||
pc|cA|nt|pdjourdain: Matches are 32 boards before VPing|pg||

pc|c4|nt|ritong: il n avait pas de complément a @d, en revanche le dixième atout présumé etait joli|pg||
pc|c9|nt|pdjourdain: Assuming south doubled the final contract the auction makes sense now|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|cT|nt|chick: I would certainly pass the 2@S bid after S's original double -- why risk disaster?|pg||
pc|c6|nt|dohicky:  or maybe not|pg||
pc|cK|pc|d2|pg||
pc|d3|nt|eamongall: me too ...|pg||
nt|chick: partner chose spades, that's all I would need to know|pg||

nt|chick: the missed 4@S on bd 6 cost them 11 imps|pg||
pc|d8|nt|barnets: in other room e/w did not bid|pg||
pc|dK|nt|barnets: so this is the first swing to scotland of any size|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|dohicky: 12 tricks now|pg||
nt|lestergold: and make overtrickas spade fimnesse is right|pg||
nt|chick: it's possible he is trying to make that back|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d6|pc|dT|pc|d9|pg||
pc|dA|nt|pdjourdain: By losing more?|pg||
nt|chick: yep, I have never understood swinging, but it happens|pg||
nt|chick: he might actually make this contract |pg||
pc|h9|nt|lestergold: so roland would be in slam as its better than 12.85%|pg||
nt|cicus: what if S now leads a heart and promotes N's K9x?|pg||
nt|cicus: (not on this hand of course)|pg||

nt|pdjourdain: So now we have to say well done not doubling, but there was a better defence|pg||

mb|p|nt|barnets: 11 imps to scotland|pg||

mb|1S|nt|lestergold: Greenwood will need to be cautious but experience has shown that these boys tend to bid any gamne they sniff|pg||
nt|cicus: E worth a game try though|pg||

nt|cicus: has to put @H shortness into the picture|pg||

nt|lestergold: bidding system probably wont permit the scots to play this hand in the best spot of 2 clubs|pg||
nt|ritong: carrément|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|eamongall: However Mesbur and Fitzgibbon have been around for many showers of rain ...so they know how to bid |pg||

nt|pdjourdain: Presumably East thought 2@C was checkback and West thought it natural|pg||
pc|c4|nt|lestergold: altho the final contract doubled is within the realms of what we see regularly in these matches|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: Alternatively the bididng needs correcting|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|xenya: all quite reasonable i think --  9 tricks|pg||

mb|p|nt|dohicky: True :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: I expect 3n making 4 |pg||
nt|lestergold: lsoing 2 spades and a club|pg||

nt|ritong: 5@d semble clair|pg||
nt|doctorone: songe a 4SA peut etre|pg||
mb|p|nt|pdjourdain: probable 9 tricks|pg||
nt|dohicky:  Could be tricky but with trumps behaving it looks ok|pg||
mb|p|nt|eamongall: I bought it ...in a bookstore in Boston some years ago |pg||
nt|lestergold: well i do n ot kn ow their bidding system|pg||
nt|ritong: excité, le frédo|pg||
pc|dK|nt|dohicky: This should be -2 now|pg||
nt|dohicky: A slam is possible I think but the 4-1 trumps would make it difficult|pg||
nt|barnets: it is though an excellent contract|pg||
nt|barnets: and west should have done more|pg||
pc|d3|nt|lestergold: but 3N or 4@h both laydown|pg||
pc|d2|nt|eamongall: em em |pg||
nt|dohicky: 3@s makes things very difficult|pg||
nt|eamongall: Adam Mesbur did not bid 4@S |pg||

pc|d6|pg||
nt|barnets: thats for sure :)|pg||
nt|barnets: can th op tell us the final contract ?|pg||
nt|eamongall: I read all the hands ...now I am reading the stories |pg||
nt|dohicky: interesting|pg||
nt|eamongall: for results etc ...start at www.nibu.co.uk and navigate to Bangor Bridge Congress page |pg||
nt|vugraphzdv: Hands seem to be transposed?|pg||
nt|lestergold: when you see both hands of course 3n is a better contract but unbiddable compared with the obvious 4@h|pg||
nt|vugraphzdv: Lead Jc|pg||
nt|lestergold: then certainly transposed|pg||
nt|lestergold: unless Liz u are already on the l.ocal tipple|pg||
nt|ritong: correct|pg||
pc|dT|nt|barnets: undo ope|pg||
nt|dohicky: There's an extra pass operator|pg||
nt|eamongall: they are doing more ...just in the wrong seats |pg||

nt|eamongall: http://www.bridgewebs.com/cgi-bin/bwma/display.cgi?pid=display_page5&club=bangorholidaycongress&sessid=545753491721727|pg||
nt|barnets: why would west want t play in 4N ?|pg||
nt|cicus: well it was a bit strange that E opened 1@H then rebid the suit...|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|barnets: east must have bid 4@S|pg||
nt|barnets: now 4N from west|pg||
nt|eamongall: it will sort itself out eventually |pg||
nt|barnets: I hope you bought it :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: after ace of clubs id play spade perosnally but as dim is right no harm done|pg||
pc|d5|nt|barnets: well i think 6@H can be made|pg||
nt|barnets: if dec plays for 6@h tricks 2@C 1@s and 3@D|pg||
nt|eamongall: well I am not arguing with Barnet Shenkin ...I was reading a book recently about playing with experts by the same guy :) |pg||
nt|ritong: la @c dame n est pas garantie, d ou la conclusion|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|xenya: yes on both points -- but it would be too much to expect S to let them play 5@D|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm south on lead? this gets curiouser and curiouser|pg||
nt|cicus: board is shifted 180 degrees plus bid out of turn?|pg||
nt|lestergold: i doubt bid out of tuen more likely 180 degrees|pg||
nt|cicus: but dealer shifts as well|pg||
nt|cicus: or am I totally confused?|pg||
nt|lestergold: I must leave for a while folks and look forward to being back for next stanza|pg||

nt|dohicky: yes|pg||
nt|dohicky: not on A and another @h lead|pg||
nt|cicus: oh no, Liz |pg||
mb|p|nt|dohicky: A weak 2 in @s with strong options|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
nt|chick: EW do have a possible sacrifice in clubs, but cannot make 5|pg||
mb|1H|nt|xenya: here too|pg||
nt|dohicky: 4@s look ok|pg||
nt|dohicky: looks|pg||
mb|p|nt|pdjourdain: 3N from north|pg||
mb|1S|nt|xenya: a @H lead might be awkward?|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6@d infrangible as cards lie|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Un 4 @S tres comfortable|pg||
mb|d|nt|cicus: again|pg||
nt|vugraphzdv: It appears so.  |pg||
nt|cicus: can you please warn them not to do it again for the last two boards?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdv: I can't clearly seethe held hand by east or south|pg||
nt|ritong: rejeté|pg||
mb|r|nt|xenya: but still should make|pg||
nt|dohicky: yes if S ducks a @c finesse after drawing trumps|pg||
nt|dohicky:  2N is probably some form of limit raise in @s|pg||
nt|lestergold: not a bad contract even with spaxdes breaking 4/2 plenty of chance of making as u cab uff a spade high if necessary|pg||
nt|ritong: ils y seraient arrivés meme sans cette intervention quelque peu insolente|pg||
mb|2D|nt|dohicky: Missing slam here could be costly|pg||
mb|3S|nt|dohicky: well with a @d lead it was down|pg||
nt|dohicky: well no it wouldnt :)|pg||
nt|xenya: i don't think so|pg||
nt|xenya: on a @H lead declarer can work on @Ds making 10 eventually|pg||
nt|dohicky: Another possible 6@h|pg||
nt|lestergold: obviously hand breaks down if both key suits break badly but thats against the odds|pg||
nt|lestergold: i will be surprised if they reach slam of course the lack of wasted in clubs is the reason for the playabkle slam here|pg||
nt|ritong: rien nulle part|pg||
mb|p|nt|dohicky:  maybe a more balanced version than 2@c|pg||
nt|lestergold: can they identify the fact that they are playibng with a thirty point pack in effect and they hold 27 of those 30 points!|pg||
nt|lestergold: its an aold and familiar story|pg||
nt|lestergold: Short will know his hand is great if south can be relied on for a stiff/void club|pg||
nt|lestergold: now short has a problem how can he show dim support and make a slam try as well?|pg||
nt|doctorone: rejete et un peu haut deja :)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|eamongall: England 139 Ireland 126 Scotland 114 I think is the current top 3 after 7 matches |pg||
nt|lestergold: looks l.ike short sighneed off in 5@d and south couldnt move|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: so it was West who opened 1NT and E transferred|pg||
nt|vugraphzdv: I don't think it's their fault - misdealt by me I think?|pg||
nt|lestergold: or can south puntit with those lousy spades?|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: 4@D was another transfer to make the hand be played by West (I am writing this hanging from the ceiling)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: surely input error|pg||

nt|dohicky: An extra pass operator|pg||
nt|dohicky:  1N is 17-19|pg||

nt|vugraphzdv: Carelessness on my part.  Sorry|pg||
nt|cicus: np, you do a fine job|pg||
nt|lestergold: spec points out that there are squeeze p;osibilities in 6H but it involves ruffing down the diamonds so west has rto guard both minors etc etc|pg||

nt|dohicky: another pass missed?|pg||
nt|cicus: 10 tricks expected here with 1@S+3@H+2@D+4@C|pg||

nt|hawe45:  Entame @S - et...|pg||
mb|2N|nt|pdjourdain: Shields was planning a penalty pass of 2D so must bid 4H now|pg||
nt|xenya: seems unlikely|pg||
nt|dohicky: well he has 2@s as 5@s and a minor|pg||
nt|lestergold: not always correct as sometimes you need to play in the long suit for reasons of control|pg||
mb|p|nt|qwikjanz: so this should catapult wales into the lead|pg||
nt|dohicky: I suppose this bidding makes some sense (except for N first pass)|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: south has the club guard so has to bid it maybe is worried about trump quality presumably can enquire about that?|pg||
