mc|11|nt|benjent: Was East's 3@c a touch heavy? Just a touch, for my money|pg||
nt|baardolav: 3nt makes too with spadelead from North|pg||
nt|benjent: I like to play 4th suit in these kinds of auctions as invitational-plus to let hands like East describe themselves|pg||
nt|baardolav: 2@s is possible to bid... good raise in @c when you have a passed hand|pg||

nt|benjent: by using 4th suit flexibly, you can use 3@d for a mixed raise|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|c8|pc|c6|pg||
nt|benjent: I guess West in the CR played a low @h towards the J immediately after drawing trumps, and got lucky. Wouldn't happen against slam of course|pg||

mc|10|nt|benjent: So tough - North led the 10 to play partner for the 9, and of course South played North for the 9|pg||

pc|h3|pc|h9|pc|hA|nt|xenya: something is wrong with my connection -- quite unusual|pg||

mc|13|nt|benjent: partner is better than even money to be the shorter in clubs of the two remaining hands, and as a 2-over-1, a decent shot to hold the @cA anyway|pg||

mb|1C|nt|Walddk2: Well, he could easily have had @DA instead of @CA. But then again, he could have a singleton club in that case|pg||

mb|p|nt|xenya: pass is reasonable i think|pg||
nt|benjent: Whenever I hold a hand like the East hand, partner overbids his black 6-5 and we wind up in some gruesome contract going many off|pg||
