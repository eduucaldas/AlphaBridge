mb|4C!|mb|5C|nt|Walddk2: 5@H by Møller now may do the trick|pg||
mb|5D!|nt|Walddk2: 5@D perhaps even better|pg||
mb|6C|nt|Walddk2: Peter Lund must like his hand very much now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@C shows a void. They would bid 3NT with an unspecified singleton|pg||
nt|rnmalik: there is no way out but to bid 6@S now|pg||
nt|jni33: I guess 5@d is a Trelde asking bid -- show control in @d and your aces partner ?|pg||
mb|6S|mb|d|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Well, they seem to mix up Trelde and cue bids. At least they did earlier today|pg||
nt|jni33: Guess not ?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 7@C DBl, par contract for this board|pg||
nt|jni33: Steen explains to Gregers that 5@d is Trelde|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and arrived in a grand slam off one cashing ace|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Not sure why Askgaard doubles when he knows Lund is void in clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: a great result for n/s|pg||
nt|jni33: But then again .. they mixed up last segment where Peter miscounted Aces and choose to show a hand with 3 aces and a void instead of a hand with one ace and no void :)|pg||
pc|hT|nt|Walddk2: He has no reason to believe that @DK will stand up|pg||

nt|jtr: Team test meaning trials?|pg||
nt|ady: better if east had continued spades when in earlier   could play a 3rd round now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They can't do anything about 2@S of course, it's only a question of overtrick or not|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sT|pc|h5|pc|s4|pg||
nt|jni33: Team Test meaning a training session for the Open Team, Women Team and Senior Team|pg||

mb|d|nt|jtr: North may like his hand facing a @h single|pg||
nt|jni33: That was Dorte Cilleborg-Lea Møller bidding and making 3@d with 11 tricks against Helle Rasmussen-Lone Bilde|pg||

mb|p|mb|3H!|nt|Walddk2: Indeed|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 5 spades and 4 hearts|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Multi in that case|pg||
nt|jtr: Might reach slam left to their own devices|pg||
nt|jni33: Board 25 has been played twice so far - E 4nt making 10 tricks ... and E 3nt making 11 tricks|pg||
nt|rnmalik: and 3NT for EW|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|ady: 6@C can make e/w|pg||
mb|d|nt|Walddk2: Double is 13-15 balanced or any 17+|pg||
nt|jtr: Pass by South?|pg||
nt|jni33: yesterday Steen and Peter had a similar situation -- ended up in 2@d DBL making 9 tricks |pg||
mb|2H!|mb|3C!|nt|jtr: I wonder if the play Leb here?|pg||
nt|jni33: 3@c might be Lebensohl|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Looks like it|pg||
nt|ady: 6@C takes some bidding|pg||
nt|jtr: And some playing too|pg||
nt|jtr: Although i guess you just ruff 2@ss|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Lund is not thinking, Askgaard is|pg||
nt|Walddk2: North and East are on the same side of the screen, and it's normal procedure for the operator not to enter anything until both players have bid|pg||
nt|jni33: We are not able to tell -- sitting on the other side of the screen -- but seems like a good guess Roland|pg||
nt|jtr: I though that was a rule?|pg||
nt|jtr: thought|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Unwritten rule rather|pg||
mb|p!|nt|jtr: Because you can hear the typing and know when someone has bid|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|ady: obvious north not thinking   |pg||
nt|jtr: Here yes but not always|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|mb|6C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jni33: Our operator does follow the rules here --- not typing before the tray is moved to the other side :)|pg||
nt|jtr: Nicely done|pg||
mb|p|nt|jni33: 5@d shows one ace|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It will take Bjarnarson a while to play this, on a trump lead for example|pg||
pc|s6|nt|jtr: Ruffing @ss seems normal|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And that spade could be a singleton, so it's not necessarily safe to cash the other spade|pg||
nt|jtr: Play a @h at trick 2 and use a @h ruff to enter hand|pg||
nt|ady: has to be careful ruffing diamonds back|pg||
nt|rnmalik: That is the only way I think of making ruff 2@S on table and claim 12|pg||
nt|jni33: EW might need a good result here to keep up with the leading pair Lars Blakset-Jacob Røn --- and we have the "grand final" in just one hour -- here Bjarnarson-Askgaard will face ...|pg||
nt|jni33: Blakset-Røn -- live here on BBO !|pg||
nt|ady: yes with no trump led a heart can be played  |pg||
nt|jtr: Maybe he can combine options?|pg||
nt|jtr: @dA and a ruff now say|pg||
nt|jtr: then the @h10|pg||
nt|jtr: another @d pitching the @hQ|pg||
nt|ady: worried about sing. spade?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, that's the issue|pg||
nt|jtr: Although that would fail if North is 2 6 2 3|pg||
nt|jni33: Bjarnarson with his head in both hands --- trying to find the right way|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Because as long as North has at least two spades, he can ruff two in dummy|pg||
nt|jtr: There is no right way really|pg||
nt|jni33: this may take a while before he plays Ace or King of @s|pg||
nt|jtr: Maybe he is deciding which one to play?:)|pg||
nt|jtr: I think it is too obscure to do anything other than hope North has 2 @ss|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|pc|s3|pg||
nt|jtr: @ds 4-3 you still need another trick|pg||
nt|ady: really dont think there is much of an alternative than ruffing 2 spades    only if their is KQX diamonds     unlikely|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|s8|pc|s5|pg||

nt|jni33: Gregers shakes his head when N follows @s here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Of course he does|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He realises that it was cold|pg||
nt|rnmalik: a possiblity exists that N go up with Ace on play of @HT otherwise the hand is history|pg||
nt|ady: it is easier seeing 4 hands   but I think declarer talked herself out of this one|pg||
nt|ady: sorry  himself|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h4|pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||

nt|jtr: What exactly did he play for here?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: @DKQx|pg||
