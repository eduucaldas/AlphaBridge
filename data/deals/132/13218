nt|henryb:  no: you don't voluntarily (very often) chose a suit as trumps in which the opponents potentially have more cards than you do|pg||
mb|3C|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Clearly, there is legal fine print with your explanation Henry.  But I'm with you, preferring the 2@H raise|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Here is a comparison|pg||
nt|bjacobs: and what a comparison it is|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: North's @D10 defeating 6@D|pg||
mb|4S|nt|henryb:  Perhaps 6@h is a MUCH better contract?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: But why did 6@D not make?|pg||
mb|5H|nt|bjacobs: spade lead, spade return|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  spade and a spade uppercut a trump trick|pg||
nt|Walddk2: right|pg||
nt|henryb:  I suspect they will play it here|pg||
nt|bjacobs: East regretting the whole sorry affair ... but he's still a chance for a big swing|pg||
nt|henryb:  East will not be proud of his 3N|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Any advice for Franchi?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Ask for some Undo's perhaps?|pg||
nt|vugraphzef: hehe, don't think the Israelians would allow that =)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They will survive 6NT as it happens|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think if I was East here, I would pass 5@H ... partner has invited slam in hearts, I reject|pg||
nt|davidb: I  am not sure that the situation is clear|pg||
nt|bjacobs: it's not clear at all, but in these situations, best to stick with very simple principles|pg||
nt|henryb:  I remind kibitzers that I do not respond to anonymous questions. I have the courtesy to tell you who I am in my profile. You should have the same|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: They are in unfamiliar territory, that's for sure|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: It certainly is|pg||

nt|Walddk2: It will, but I am reluctant to calculate percentages|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Is it so clear to guess the heart?  |pg||
nt|davidb: not at all|pg||

pc|d5|pc|c7|pc|cK|pg||
nt|bjacobs: There's a fair argument for guessing the hearts right.  Don't you really need North to be long in diamonds?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: At least 3 ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not if @SK drops, Bill|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So 5+ spades, 3+ diamonds, presumably some clubs|pg||
