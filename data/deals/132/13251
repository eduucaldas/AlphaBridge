nt|oleberg: (Where it is known)|pg||
nt|jni33: Bjarnarson-Askgaard need to win with 16 imps to win the "tournament"|pg||
nt|oleberg: Both pairs play the 1@D opening as always unbalanced.|pg||
nt|patricck: 4@S makes here, and it is a reasonably good game, declarer would need oto be lucky in one of the black suits|pg||

nt|oleberg: A true yarl|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|d|nt|marlowepi: hi all|pg||
nt|patricck: yes, better for poker, at least he would have four nines :)|pg||
nt|chick: hi Marshall|pg||
mb|p!|mb|2C!|nt|Walddk2: A Yarborough is a hand with no card higher than a nine spot. The term is derived from Lord Yarborough of England, who offered a wager with odds of 1,000 pounds to one against the ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: chance of any player having such a holding. The actual chance of any player holding a hand with no card higher than a nine has been mathematically equated to 1,827 to 1|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|oleberg: And a killer in Chinese poker|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|3C|nt|oleberg: NS plays "Nilsland", so North's pass required redouble|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h3|nt|jni33: ohhh|pg||
nt|oleberg: Doing this, instead of bidding 2@S directly, tells the NT-opener, that he may compete to three, on a suitable hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Lars will hate this lead, but the contract is still down|pg||
nt|patricck: Still not good enough. Declarer can lose only one club, but when east comes in A@S and another leaves nowhere to put the 4th @D|pg||
pc|hA|nt|patricck: *west|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h6|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|pc|c8|pc|h5|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h8|pc|cT|nt|oleberg: Quite a position from South, to bid 4@S|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|oleberg: But being behind 16 against very competent opponents, it may be ok|pg||
nt|jni33: Maybe Lars liked the lead ... when he saw dummy he was very happy not being left in 3@h dbl |pg||
nt|patricck: Even if the bidding is invitational from North his hand is not that attractive|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|d4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: At least East has one valuable card, @D9, the Curse of Scotland|pg||
pc|hT|pc|cQ|nt|oleberg: No. But NS is also much into making a good system, so there may be something we dont know|pg||
pc|c4|pc|h2|pg||
nt|patricck: good play, now West must play A@S @S or it might make|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Indeed|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But if anyone can work that out, Lars is the man|pg||
nt|oleberg: West might think declarer fears an overruff|pg||
nt|oleberg: But he is opening his communication for a crossruff|pg||
nt|patricck: West will fear that North's @D are Q9xx |pg||
nt|Walddk2: What can he do if they are?|pg||
nt|patricck: northing I guess, but maybe another @H might be right if partner has J@S|pg||
nt|oleberg: Lars knows that NS are very good, but also very gutsy. And ready to take a position, if they believe in it.|pg||
nt|jni33: Lars has the @h J in hand ... under the table ... noone else than Emil and I can see it|pg||
nt|jni33: "the little details" says Lars|pg||
nt|patricck: North really needs @S KQJxx for the bidding. playing partner to hold 9@D seems better odds than the J@S|pg||
nt|oleberg: not so obvious to me|pg||
nt|jni33: now @c A in hand|pg||
nt|oleberg: Even without the @SJ, the bids seem okay|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Small wishes come true more frequently than big ones|pg||
nt|patricck: Surely A@C can't be right? North bid out his shape|pg||
nt|oleberg: As far as I know, the sequence wasn't invitational|pg||
nt|patricck: South must have thought so because his hand was hardly a gem of a 1NT opener :)|pg||
nt|jni33: Lars asks a lot of questions to Michael|pg||
nt|jni33: "can N have 4@s and 5@d" he askes ... "I have newer seen it" is Michaels response|pg||
pc|cA|pc|s2|nt|jni33: @c A it is|pg||

pc|d3|pc|d8|pc|s6|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|oleberg: It is suggested, that East would have played a high diamond on the heart, if he wanted an uppercut|pg||
nt|patricck: Indeed that would be good defence from East. West really should have got this right, but this is the last match of a stressful event :)|pg||
nt|jni33: And the first punch from NS seems to be a "success" ... Bjarnarson is thinking |pg||

pc|c3|pc|cJ|pc|s7|pc|c9|pg||

mc|10|nt|chick: the 10 seems right|pg||

nt|chick: probably the operator already starting to claim :)|pg||
mb|1D|nt|Walddk2: Emil could see that the 8 was big enough, so he played that. Well done :)|pg||
nt|patricck: Big start for NS, they almost certainly have the 16 imps they need from the 1st two boards, so the winner of the event is in the balance|pg||
mb|d|mb|4D|mb|4S|nt|oleberg: Slightly off-shape take-out double, but nescesary|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: He has compensating values; double is fine|pg||
nt|chick: I rarely get better shape than that for a takeout|pg||
nt|jni33: I'll try to keep you updated with results from the other three tables later|pg||
nt|patricck: South can diagnose that there is spade shortage opposite and his own spades are rubbish, so he should have bid 5@D|pg||
nt|oleberg: North knows that South has 5 diamonds or more, unless he is marmic|pg||
nt|chick: and non vul opposite vul makes it even more attractive|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|dA|nt|oleberg: I do not find it obvious that South should have bid 5@D. Other things than thrumphs may defeat games, abd partner may already have taken a position|pg||
nt|patricck: Quite right for North to pass, he doesn't want to sacrifice if South has 4 chunky spades. South is the one who can see how bad his spades are|pg||
nt|oleberg: But surely 5@D would be tempting|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d3|pc|s2|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|pc|sA|pc|d5|pg||
nt|oleberg: I think I would have sacrificed with the North hand. It seems likely,that the opponents has guessed right|pg||

pc|d9|pc|d6|pc|s5|pc|d2|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h8|pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|oleberg: But it is okay for suoth to sell out. They have made the opponents guess, and 4@S could be off, and 6@S could be a winner.|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hT|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d8|nt|oleberg: If it was only an eight card fit, a 4-1 break can be a nuisance, even if it is four small|pg||

mb|1S|nt|Walddk2: South must insert @HK|pg||
mb|p|nt|oleberg: And with the limited, unbalanced opening, North has licence to preempt on a wide range of hands|pg||
mb|2S!|mb|p|mb|3H!|nt|oleberg: 2@S shows a good raise to 2@S|pg||
nt|oleberg: The weak raise is included in the forcing 1NT response|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Do they play Romex?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@H looks like a short suit trial bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|c9|nt|patricck: That will encourage North to lead 9@C rather than K@H|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cA|pc|c2|pg||

nt|patricck: :) don't we all?|pg||
nt|oleberg: :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not if you ask the gentleman in the West seat|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He made one in 1971, but the mistake was that he admitted to having made one, he added|pg||
mb|1N|mb|3C|mb|4H|nt|patricck: Yes, perhaps he should review Board 2 then :)|pg||
nt|oleberg: Wow|pg||
nt|chick: Roland admitted a mistake once, too.   He thought he was wrong, but he wasn't :)|pg||
nt|jni33: Board 5 has been played at one table so far .. result: E 6@s DBL making 11|pg||
mb|p|nt|oleberg: 3@C must be constructive on the (11) 12-14 NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1NT??|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That is some upgrade to a 12-14 NT|pg||
nt|patricck: What drugs are NS on here?  Can we have some?|pg||
nt|oleberg: Only North seems to be on drugs on this hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|cK|pc|c3|pc|c9|pc|c6|pg||
nt|oleberg: Upgrading the North hand to 11 good seems far out, maybe he miscounted|pg||
nt|jni33: "I had 12 when I opened" says Gregers .... "12 card og 12 hcp" asks Askgaard ... :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The North hand is worth 9.9 according to K&R|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=10xx+K9x+AQ10x+Jxx|pg||

mb|p|nt|chick: he did have an entry, but not in time|pg||
nt|oleberg: Pass out is, slightly remote, possibilety|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|nt|oleberg: Not everyone will open the North hand 1NT vul|pg||
nt|patricck: The difficulty is not knowing what sort of hand east had. If you knew it was a long running suit type maybe you wouldn't lead a @C at all|pg||
mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Spec suggests that North should have bid 3@S over 3@C. That would have made it easier for South|pg||
nt|Walddk2: However, declarer could have had @CQx|pg||
nt|oleberg: I know I said 1@D is always unbalanced, but third hand gives libetyes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Which looked entirely possible as he got an even count (@C3). Sadly, it was a singleton|pg||
nt|oleberg: And it is highly likely that a diamond will be the best lead from partner|pg||
