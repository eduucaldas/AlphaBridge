nt|ralfwil: good evening everyone|pg||
mb|3C|nt|szalay: anyone 4 3@C pre?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: likely 3N for EW|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hello everyone|pg||
nt|haans: normally balanced 12-14|pg||
mb|d|nt|szalay: I strongly believe its an option in white|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Owen Lien and Doug Dey are players from North Carolina (District 7)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hey buddies, gl operator|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: things are going wrong with the boards|pg||
nt|haans: what should nilsen bid|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i can live withh 1N|pg||
nt|sharkey: 1 NT|pg||
nt|h_karluk: welcome back|pg||
nt|szalay: doubt they will bid it|pg||
nt|chick: 3N unspecified splinter?|pg||
nt|szalay: hi all|pg||
nt|sybarra: S  was our operator in last match |pg||
nt|yuval10: W is Giampietro, Cristina|pg||
nt|daman: would we double with the South hand?|pg||
nt|haans: double?|pg||
nt|daman: or would we bid 2@C?    2@H?|pg||
nt|daman: pass is not an option|pg||
nt|haans: diamond will win|pg||
nt|chick: 2@H would be my choice|pg||
nt|haans: 2+ is alertable|pg||
nt|daman: it really doesn't matter because West will always compete in @Ds|pg||
nt|sybarra: gm Simon :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: Hello Simon|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hello everyone from Manchester|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Hey y'all , welcome to White House Juniors - Round Robin 15 of 23|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hello hamdi|pg||
nt|h_karluk: welcome back Kath|pg||
nt|h_karluk: however likely a 4@h game for NS, obvious losers are a @h, a @c and a @d|pg||
nt|othered1: What special stuff?|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: 9-12 NT and some brown stickers|pg||
nt|lestergold: no!|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: overbidding|pg||
nt|daman: 2@D must be a transfer|pg||
nt|chick: transfer advances?|pg||
nt|haans: if they make 1ntx they get 180|pg||
nt|daman: oui|pg||
nt|haans: :) Hi and Welcome :)|pg||
nt|haans: not all open clubs here|pg||
nt|haans: good passing|pg||
nt|pierced: they play multi|pg||
mb|4H|nt|rnmalik: there are chances for going overboard, funny hand first up|pg||
nt|szalay: hi all|pg||
nt|ady: n/s may get to game in no-trumps    likely to go down|pg||
nt|haans: yep |pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/index.php?option=com_frontpage&Itemid=76|pg||
nt|szalay: I suppose 2@H was both majors|pg||
nt|sybarra: you can find list of participants, and standings on that site|pg||
nt|szalay: btw its a bit strange North didnt open|pg||
nt|szalay: probably 4@D SPL is the best bid by West|pg||
nt|haans: looks like bergen raise|pg||
nt|h_karluk: nevertheless EW have effective defense|pg||
nt|haans: not to nice bidding|pg||
nt|haans: we all been there|pg||
nt|sybarra: you almost had to bid the 8654 |pg||
nt|sybarra: but if you stick to 4 card suits up the line |pg||
nt|haans: u will soon|pg||
nt|othered1: 26 HCP, a bunch of tricks, and a very lucky @H suit blockage, so 3N is on.|pg||
nt|sybarra: had=hate |pg||
nt|lestergold: 3@s the limit|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: will e/e  steal the contract    n/s can make a lucky 3NT  and make and make a safer contract in diamonds  10 tricks|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hello Kath from South Carolina, Columbia|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i was just looking at the list of countries playing  but what is the World Team?|pg||
nt|othered1: but good bidding may keep them out of it.|pg||
nt|yuval10: 2@d reverse drury 9-11 points exactly 3 @h's|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: Israel play stad Israeli, I believe: strong NT, 5 card major, etc.|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: EW play natural, I think|pg||
nt|frankaus: not me  - 4 @S  would tempt me|pg||
nt|frankaus: then i'm a senior|pg||
nt|szalay: match starts with a boring 3N|pg||
nt|haans: doomed|pg||
nt|sybarra: and S has no further interest |pg||
nt|szalay: I dont suggest spl with 3 trumps only|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh, sorry,  S is brother of operator of last match |pg||
nt|chick: nor do I|pg||
nt|chick: E will leave that with his heart holding|pg||
nt|daman: West will balance|pg||
nt|haans: Hi Simon|pg||
nt|h_karluk: such as playing @h A then @c to cut ruff|pg||
nt|haans: SUCTION: When suction is agreed, a suit overcall of a 1NT opening is conventional and denies the suit actually bid. It shows either (1) a one-suiter in the next higher ranking suit ...|pg||
nt|haans: or (2) a two suiter in the other two suits|pg||
nt|haans: as HagZ say 3NT makes|pg||
mb|p|nt|VugraphPl1: http://michzimny.pl/bridge/2010/pila/gp.html|pg||
nt|ady: e/w can make 3NT    but hardly bidable|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=80&Itemid=72  for participants |pg||
nt|rnmalik: EW have 9 tricks as the cards are placed, agree.|pg||
nt|szalay: ok, u can drink coffee, he will make it|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I suggest - but do not support|pg||
nt|chick: many people like to play 1@S 4@H as natural hearts, so 3N gives a way to make a heart splinter|pg||
nt|chick: but in this hand, I would just bid a 2/1 2@D (or other game force)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  So would we all, I think|pg||
nt|haans: diamond will win|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ady: 2@H open room so will be a push|pg||
nt|hawe45:  2 NT checking for slam ambitions|pg||
nt|chick: imho, S is not strong enough for 2N|pg||
nt|haans: no stop there|pg||
nt|yuval10: T@s looks like the natural lead|pg||
nt|haans: many nowday bid 2nt invite or better|pg||
nt|yuval10: link for results : http://www.nbbportal.nl/1003/|pg||
nt|yuval10: click on "competitie"|pg||
nt|chick: W already neglected to bid @Ds, would be surprised to see him come in at the 3 level|pg||
nt|othered1: south has a very good looking hand for this auction|pg||
nt|haans: only game that makes|pg||
nt|lestergold: unless they read heart position|pg||
nt|petergill: !NT on a spade lead might be quite interesting to play|pg||
nt|petergill: 1NT|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hello Peter!|pg||
pc|c5|nt|sybarra: do we have running scores Jacco?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: last time i saw Owen in Tri City (West Columbia) sectional, he is 21 y.o., educating in Economics branch in NC State College|pg||
nt|haans: clubs lead?|pg||
nt|haans: best|pg||
nt|ady: even on the lead will go down on a heart switch|pg||
nt|daman: uh oh|pg||
nt|haans: that double is new|pg||
nt|h_karluk: cake and walk contract, push next please |pg||
nt|sybarra: thx Hans |pg||
nt|yo_yo: thanks|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: has Whibley shown his good hand?|pg||
nt|haans: Hi Peter|pg||
pc|c2|nt|xenya: well EW can make 6@D|pg||
nt|szalay: but if u have singleton, better to show it yourself|pg||
nt|daman: it was OK for him to pass 2@D    he was going to get anpther chance to bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: EW lead 2/4|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think 3@h is a bit exaggerated call with such balanced junk|pg||
nt|haans: bridge here is just tuff :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: maybe some kind of transfer? allows you to bid your fit with weak hands like this or stronger ones (raise later again)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: good evening all|pg||
nt|h_karluk: welcome back Ralf|pg||
nt|yuval10: 2@c would've been 7-11 4 @h's |pg||
nt|pierced: 8 tricks are coming|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 4th seat 4cm M, maybe 1@d has a different meaning there or say in case lost auction might try to show the lead to his p|pg||
nt|yuval10: this lead will help declarer|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|szalay: after given bidding best trump play (double hook) is even better|pg||
nt|xenya: hello again|pg||
nt|haans: opening 1@C was suicide here|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe should have ducked that one |pg||
nt|haans: did not like @C switch|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: he was afraid for @C's wasnt he?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: good lead|pg||
nt|haans: believe so|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: Justin said so, probably he did|pg||
nt|petergill: You can take the obvious line of play and finesse South for @CQ, failing, or|pg||
nt|petergill: Hi Ralf, Hans|pg||
pc|h2|nt|szalay: ok, u can try 6@D, but its terrible...long run I dont suggest slams with 30 hcp and 2 balanced hands|pg||
nt|szalay: bid your games, take your tricks (by Hamman) is good advice in any level|pg||
nt|sybarra: I take it this is the "slam try" sequence |pg||
nt|szalay: with aceless 11, with Qx @C I wd just say 3N, confess|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: I think east made a slamtry here, that is what i heard from the explanation from west|pg||
nt|szalay: a bit starnge 3@C rebid except its forcing (doubt it) with 9 top tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: nope it works now|pg||
nt|hawe45:  East and West doÂ´nt play the same system here|pg||
nt|haans: not in agrement here|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i would RD there onstead of 2@d, 2ndly i would definitely start with 1@h|pg||
nt|haans: 2@D show support|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|ady: west should know on the 2 lead that north has 5 clubs|pg||
nt|haans: whappen happened her|pg||
nt|frankaus: 15 2 H in pd major - pd opens - how many will stay short of game?|pg||
nt|haans: non vul yes |pg||
nt|haans: you need 50% to bid game|pg||
nt|h_karluk: my sys card is 2/1 - so it's impossible to stop before game with EW hands|pg||
nt|szalay: and ART asking bid w/o shortness|pg||
nt|daman: the axe might be unsheathed again|pg||
nt|daman: but maybe not|pg||
nt|daman: 3@C was very risky given North only promises 2|pg||
nt|chick: true, but ... he is better getting in his one bid at the first chance and then stay very quiet|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: So the names will be up soon again|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ah i see|pg||
nt|haans: if no double all ok|pg||
nt|sybarra: not easy when 1 cl opened on your right |pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: NS lead 2/4, and \west tells he has a lot\|pg||
nt|sybarra: brb  on ne pc |pg||
nt|haans: more normal is playing polish against polish|pg||
nt|sybarra: re |pg||
nt|haans: we got it :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: but EW are from down under, so not really used to play against Polish\|pg||
pc|h3|nt|szalay: if it was slamtry, West wd accept for sure|pg||
nt|h_karluk: he and his mother Miss Anita are BBO players|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Yuval Yener|pg||
nt|yuval10: hi all|pg||
nt|haans: mirrow hands not thye best|pg||
nt|h_karluk: unfortunately i've no idea , maybe just a show match, saw in Venice Olympiads long years ago|pg||
pc|hA|nt|frankaus: i can handle the language of a child in hungarian but no idea about bridge terminology|pg||
nt|sybarra: this match is  2 Francy v   3 Neth. Blue|pg||
nt|hawe45:  He had seen his cards...(North)|pg||
nt|haans: diamond will win|pg||
nt|vbman: hi all|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hi welcome|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @h A and @c back obvious|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so that leaves alone with 2 more @c losers|pg||
nt|haans: Ficher may discard a spade|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|sharkey: sry - crashed|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Also welcome to Adam Kaplan|pg||

nt|mtvesuvius: Hi all :)|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Adam|pg||
nt|haans: hi adam still only 14?|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: *still*, yes :)|pg||
nt|haans: well cure for that|pg||
nt|othered1: I couldn't stay out of @C game on this auction (but I would have overcalled, not doubled as north)|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: they overcall light (they said)|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: so dbl and bidding suit is light too\|pg||
nt|haans: yep make or fall nothing else :|pg||
mc|10|nt|h_karluk: and then RD?|pg||
nt|haans: same distribution|pg||

nt|ady: J@C   big card in west hand   e/w can make 3NT|pg||
nt|ady: danger of 1@C being passed out|pg||
nt|szalay: I think 1@C is not an option|pg||
nt|sybarra: and stiff A of @C makes the hand easy|pg||

nt|h_karluk: i think 2@s fine now|pg||
nt|jcwla: This just looks like "mine is bigger than yours" -- suit that is.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: such 3@h dangerous with balanced junks - proved|pg||

nt|Walddk4: As long as she is not amiss|pg||

nt|szalay: why not 4@H with passed pd?|pg||
nt|frankaus: Ax no the best stopper in the world often better played from Qx side|pg||
nt|szalay: slam is unlikely, @H are good, so?|pg||
nt|sybarra: but unlikely to keep e/w out of 4 @H |pg||
nt|sybarra: you had the one with the picture |pg||
nt|sharkey: appears 4@S can be made - however, may have transportation problems|pg||
nt|ady: part score hand    n/s may be able to stop in 2@D|pg||
nt|chick: with all their controls, can EW stay out of the @D slam?|pg||
nt|szalay: good 4@Hs fails, worse 3N COULD be make (for @H lead)|pg||
nt|xenya: i would be content with just 1@S|pg||
nt|haans: ms|pg||
nt|copeyj: there we go|pg||
nt|copeyj: Some pairs play X of a strong NT as artificial, including myself. But when the opps have opened 1N 3rd seat nv I play penalty doubles|pg||
nt|copeyj: Would be useful here to have a penalty double available|pg||
nt|tomi2: no blame to the 3@H bid imo if he howed 4 card fit with some values. 4@S was the expensive bid|pg||
nt|pierced: they will fight for medal in philadelphia|pg||
nt|haans: 2nt|pg||
mb|3S|nt|sybarra: the website|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like 12 tricks for me....previous hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Peter |pg||
nt|szalay: it was 11-14 NT|pg||
nt|daman: another partscore?   EW have the potential for a lot of tricks in @Cs|pg||
nt|po-s: depends how mny diamonds 1D showed. Nowadays......|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Hello Han!|pg||
mb|5C|nt|frankaus: looks like a 30 point deck to E |pg||
nt|h_karluk: so far EW 5@c-1 and NS 4@s -1|pg||
nt|szalay: pass with 4 hcp (including a King) very dangerous|pg||
nt|ady: even 2NT opening did not get them to game|pg||
nt|sybarra: can S venture a bid,  yes he does|pg||
nt|sybarra: n/s may push them a bit here|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I only bid 2 @H here with a @h-suit...|pg||
nt|chick: you think S's suit is too weak?|pg||
nt|yuval10: i would've pass from E, to be honest|pg||
nt|haans: nothing perfect|pg||
nt|daman: and can make 8 tricks in NT|pg||
nt|sybarra: can xx and land in clubs |pg||
nt|mcphee: E might try for game here|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 4H looks OK but not enough points to bid it probably|pg||
nt|haans: talking about old deals Is that winning bridge?|pg||
nt|petergill: If North can identify South with six spades, @SAK and the two aces, North can count the 13 tricks|pg||
nt|han: Hi Ralf|pg||
nt|han: EW put the pressure on NY on this board|pg||
mb|d|nt|haans: then we understand|pg||
nt|po-s: In France I bet they have penalty doubles|pg||
nt|h_karluk: http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/     to watch other rooms same time |pg||
nt|poohbear: I am sure declarer played for the failing Squeeze|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @s overcall quite interesting|pg||
nt|vbman: not my party|pg||
nt|poohbear: Ran his trumps and when the Ace of @ds wasnt with the Q of @s he conceded another|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://nbbuitslagen.transfer-solutions.com/uss/goPage30.do?rndid=74915&verid=805&start=19  for standings after 19 rounds|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: and E with 4333....|pg||
nt|szalay: wd u bid 5@D over 1@D-4@H-?|pg||
nt|sybarra: this may go 2 @H all pass |pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: yes but that is a blog|pg||
nt|ady: n/s likely to play 2@H|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i would even not try it|pg||
nt|sharkey: Standings after 2 rounds: http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=85&Itemid=79|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: after 3 rounds actuallly|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but i would rebid 1N as West|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 3@c wouldn't be much fun to play|pg||
nt|copeyj: Double is probably artificial it has been alerted|pg||
nt|copeyj: Bessis will be pleasantly surprised by his partner's choice of suit|pg||
nt|copeyj: note E/W can get out for 300 in 5@CX|pg||
nt|copeyj: and even 6@CX is a profitable save against 11 tricks in @S|pg||
nt|mcphee: to coind a phrase, points smoints|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Kopecky is bidding up¬|pg||
nt|vbman: yes its non vuln. but the suit quality is below zero|pg||
nt|othered1: not to  me, but I know many players for whom it's irrelevant.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i guess physical and mental firmness will tell last words, short breaks between matches|pg||
nt|ralfwil: now he can |pg||
nt|petergill: 3@S helps, showing six spades and a good hand|pg||
nt|haans: but must find @SK|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 4nt and 4 aces|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: interesting 1NT|pg||
nt|szalay: in junior/female tourney I think to play weak nt 2/1 is an advantage|pg||
nt|haans: and a make :)|pg||
nt|haans: and then ...|pg||
nt|haans: good pass by south|pg||
nt|Walddk4: If LC had been here, he would call 3@S an anti-Law bid|pg||
nt|haans: 1st time ive seen walsh trf here|pg||
nt|h_karluk: these kids jumping too much|pg||
nt|petergill: South is less well placed to bid the grand himself, as he cannot visualise the solid five heart tricks in partner's hand|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but N can see 13 tricks after that S has shown 4 aces|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://nbbuitslagen.transfer-solutions.com/uss/goPage30.do?rndid=74915&verid=805&start=22  for standings after 22 rounds|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: 4@s is some bid by N, P has a very good support though|pg||
nt|yuval10: and now probably bid 5@s ?|pg||
nt|sharkey: Gembick's pass??|pg||
nt|haans: 1n bye North?|pg||
nt|haans: nopåe|pg||
nt|haans: not a nice bid when vul|pg||
nt|sharkey: They've landed in their best strain|pg||
nt|ady: north 2@D rebid very respectable|pg||
nt|sybarra: dout you get killed at the 2 level,  I would bid  ...sort of only chance|pg||
nt|sybarra: *doubt |pg||
nt|chick: should make this|pg||
nt|haans: dirty hand for 4@S but best choice|pg||
nt|h_karluk: if only 4 cards support would be a scale to fix everything, then there were not much words|pg||
nt|haans: all bid and bid and bid|pg||
nt|haans: to long way to slam|pg||
nt|othered1: what was double? |pg||
pc|d7|nt|sybarra: ir 2 @C all pass |pg||
nt|haans: 2@D must be 6-carder|pg||
nt|ady: unfortunately may well go down |pg||
nt|pelu: I would open 2NT (20-21) - over 1@C - 1X I bid 3MT = 15-18 with long @C|pg||
nt|daman: 5@C was aggressive|pg||
nt|mcphee: attack or passive lead?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: personally i didn't get 2NT rebid, OK 15 there however 5431, maybe a good reason to start with F---y convention, but it seems not in their CC|pg||
nt|yo_yo: gosh a working 13 opposite a balanced 8 count|pg||
nt|haans: West have told u|pg||
nt|han: attacking hearts from the north side the defense can take 3 hearts|pg||
nt|han: north would have to lead the jack|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Yes That classic @h return when @h10 on dummy|pg||
nt|han: That would mean +500|pg||
pc|dA|nt|szalay: why not double by South?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 2254 and 15|pg||
nt|hawe45:  By several levels too weak - and only @C-lead defeats 6 @D|pg||
nt|szalay: its not true Open highest level|pg||
nt|yuval10: i think it's makeable in any way, via @c finesse|pg||
nt|haans: if opps do not play @H raise @D|pg||
nt|mcphee: this may fail|pg||
nt|yo_yo: what's  that convention?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and i think 1M>2M in their book is 8-10 max, if that's true i wld gladly offer 2@s rebid|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: 2nt was shortness in @c they say|pg||
nt|mcphee: declarer needs to do a lot of work|pg||
nt|mcphee: looks like 1 down to me|pg||
nt|yo_yo: isnt it 3 losers?|pg||
nt|mcphee: i doubt they will allow a dummy entry after this lead|pg||
nt|mcphee: low @D fro hand to the 8 or 9 only way to make now|pg||
nt|h_karluk: srry for my wrong input abt E's holding, 4531 is correct|pg||
nt|petergill: Is AJ10xxxxx, -, Kx, KQx a possible 3@S bid. If so, North has to bid 5@S over 5@C, then South will bid on, as is required with 4 keycards. |pg||
nt|haans: but 3@S???|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ady: best spot for n/s is clubs  but unable to get there|pg||
nt|sybarra: a @h lead might not be so pleasant |pg||
nt|ady: may well be a swing for Netherlands|pg||
nt|szalay: in 4N|pg||
nt|haans: and clubs honors right|pg||
nt|sybarra: works on this hand |pg||
nt|sybarra: (maybe)|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: if you play strong 1N i|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: you probably will play there|pg||
nt|mcphee: lose 2@S 1@D 1@H|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i don't think EW pairs would have any difficulty to reach game|pg||
nt|haans: but what is trump|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|frankaus: traffic light is red pays to be conservative|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh well what do I know |pg||
nt|haans: 4@H young bidding|pg||
nt|h_karluk: this time black Kings are not favorably placed|pg||
nt|daman: opposite a passed hand|pg||
nt|vbman: s better starts to finger the two of hearts|pg||
nt|poohbear: This is a typical problem hand. West has extras but cant show them without going past 3nt.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and i wonder alloted time for 10 boards|pg||
nt|pierced: 1@d with 8 points |pg||
nt|han: NS can make 4S but it is not 100% clear that they would|pg||
pc|c6|nt|szalay: e-w gave them all the chance|pg||
nt|xenya: they might get to a hopeless slam now -- and they did|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 @S?  rkk ? |pg||
nt|szalay: u can beat 5@C if u play some special (lavinthal, roman) signal over A of @S|pg||
nt|haans: E dont fool me|pg||
nt|szalay: some specs asked why|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 5@D is makeable, this contract looks unlucky|pg||
nt|szalay: I think cause at Open this kinda toy isnt so dangerous|pg||
nt|szalay: in junior/female tourney 80% or more of the field unfamiliar with weak NT sys|pg||
nt|szalay: I think no pair in the World who wd play 5-3 minor-suit game instead of 5-3 major|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true |pg||
nt|daman: who simply raised|pg||
nt|haans: they have clubs you have points so play clubs|pg||
nt|mcphee: running the @C however will help|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that's a brave duck|pg||
nt|pierced: oh no 12 :)|pg||
nt|pierced: 1down like in 1NT|pg||
nt|han: I think so though|pg||
pc|c3|nt|szalay: I think first step to trap was 1@H...after that they came deeper and deeper|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: seemed like a cuebid auction to me|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/index.php?option=com_frontpage&Itemid=76|pg||
nt|sybarra: this site has a picture of the beautiful facility at the White House |pg||
nt|yuval10: will make 11 now|pg||
nt|othered1: penalty double of 1@D?  I'd be defending the third overtrick in 1@DXX if I tried that.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: WD|pg||
pc|cK|nt|sybarra: it is a reburbished tennis club,  (still active tennis courts)  and a wonder bridge facility |pg||
nt|chick: no club finesse necessary |pg||
nt|haans: but bid but|pg||
nt|haans: big|pg||
nt|haans: but agree a not needed jump|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|ady: yes agree should be 6 card suit  but AQ to 6 and 2 outside aces is top weight|pg||
nt|daman: I don't think there are 11 tricks|pg||
nt|haans: :)))|pg||
nt|petergill: I meant KQx, Kx in minors|pg||
pc|s6|nt|szalay: or by accident, only|pg||
nt|chick: :)|pg||
nt|poohbear: and now they just spiral up into slam|pg||
pc|sA|nt|sybarra: and they are playing with screens |pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/index.php?option=com_content&task=blogcategory&id=31&Itemid=78   standing after round 1|pg||
nt|sybarra: long way to go |pg||
nt|frankaus: can get it home on this lead|pg||
nt|h_karluk: honestly i would bid 4@d as West|pg||
nt|yuval10: the lead was one more good reason for not opening 1@h with such a poor suit |pg||
nt|haans: if only 1@S overcall is not game harder to find?|pg||
nt|xenya: i agree|pg||
nt|xenya: nice lead -- tough for declarer now as entries to dummy are scarce|pg||
pc|sK|nt|rnmalik: @D back|pg||
nt|ady: defence should prevail |pg||
nt|yo_yo: I dont know much about this event  ( too old)   does anyone else?|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|han: @s10 might ask for a heart switch|pg||
nt|han: suit preference when no more tricks in the suit can be taken|pg||
nt|ralfwil: with @cA he could await|pg||
nt|han: a heart switch would not necessarily be good|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: the T was so slow, must be heart signal :)|pg||
pc|d8|nt|haans: better late than never|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 3@s is definitely an agressive bid... I am not a fan|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ady: spade lay out bad for declarer|pg||
nt|haans: @H" = hearts 4-4|pg||
nt|mcphee: but actually declarer still had same problem even winning @CQ|pg||
nt|mcphee: now it is making|pg||
nt|poohbear: opp 6-4 Slam might make but here declarer needs 3-3 @ds essentially|pg||
nt|h_karluk: the way on slam, h lead serves to set while diamonds aren't friendly, but passive lead might help while @s A favorably placed|pg||
nt|vbman: sp ace is correct|pg||
nt|h_karluk: say N had 3 cards trump maybe a chance, but this time short dias with 3 cards trumps tho they would soon vanished|pg||
nt|poohbear: Can do it now on a non @h lead. Can set up @ds using the @s as an entry . But I dont see how he gets his second @s trick|pg||
nt|h_karluk: still working on it Barry|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think makes|pg||
nt|poohbear: I guess win the @D lead a @s then play top @d ruff a @d and lead another @s up using trumps as the entry. THat should do it|pg||
nt|h_karluk: in case plays a small spade to table, no matter ducked|pg||
nt|poohbear: 4@d 2@s 1H 5 trumps|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so we counted same tricks, good|pg||
nt|yo_yo: just trumps to negotiate now |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|rnmalik: the bidding sequence enabled EW to find the defence to 2@H|pg||
nt|haans: clubs ruff?|pg||
nt|frankaus: not easy to switch to 1S|pg||
nt|frankaus: @S|pg||
nt|xenya: i meant about the 1@H opening|pg||
nt|haans: 2|pg||
nt|h_karluk: it's a classic|pg||
nt|yo_yo: and why is it called the White House?|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|szalay: 2@D was NOT xfer, was gameforcing stayman|pg||
nt|szalay: 3@D had shown a normal 6card or very good 5card suit|pg||
nt|mcphee: 2 table entries for sure|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, down off the top but EW can make 2@C |pg||
nt|han: a heart to the king would actually be good, north could play club ace and another club|pg||
nt|han: the diamonds don't run and NS can then prevent the spade ruff|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If tempo of discarding is a signal, I don´t like it|pg||
nt|han: when declarer has to play hearts himself later, he is down 800|pg||
pc|d3|pc|h2|nt|ady: cant see any other bidding possible|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am not so sure why N bid over 2 @C |pg||
nt|sybarra: where was he going?|pg||
nt|ady: this might be down 3|pg||
nt|ady: 9 tricks on any lead|pg||
nt|haans: very few have methods for a prempts after 1nt opening|pg||
pc|c5|nt|frankaus: WD|pg||
nt|h_karluk: also not hard with @s T9 etc|pg||
nt|szalay: I confess I wd bid 3N directly over that|pg||
nt|copeyj: ah sorry 5@CX is 500|pg||
nt|copeyj: thanks kibs :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: was lucky enough to avoid killing @h lead as i said when i 1st saw the layout|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|haans: best defense|pg||
nt|tomi2: both teams travelled from outside europe, so both don't want to pass :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think Dwyer should refresh his LTC knowledges|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|animeshraj: a low h now!  and h q frm west|pg||
nt|yuval10: 9@d will enable declarer to avoid @d loser|pg||
nt|Walddk4: All results (including butlers and hand records) on www.nbbportal.nl/1003/ > 'competitie'|pg||
nt|vbman: must still be careful|pg||
nt|poohbear: that simplifies matters |pg||
nt|vbman: people dont lead their singletons against slams when they have a side ace|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|sybarra: oh well |pg||
pc|c7|nt|yo_yo: so many events for Juniors nowadays  |pg||
nt|h_karluk: http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/|pg||
nt|h_karluk: trump quality very substantial|pg||
nt|sybarra: picking him clean so to speak |pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|szalay: and my fate is in West's hand|pg||
nt|othered1: @S 10 isn't totally out of play yet|pg||
pc|c8|nt|h_karluk: @d9 was indeed a slip in defense - either @hJ or small @c would work better|pg||
nt|szalay: always tough to decide between strong 4card or weaker 5card suit to lead vs. 3N|pg||
nt|yo_yo: well i take my hat off to them, bidding and making that game|pg||
nt|vbman: not sure this is the best line|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cQ|nt|poohbear: now can test trumps and if they are not 3-2 can fall back on 3-3 @ds|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|xenya: if E has @CA and a spade honour, slam is quite good -- perhaps too much to ask for? |pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: declarer claims @D7, but some debate whether it counts when @D is trump suit :)|pg||
nt|daman: down 1|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|nt|haans: ruff|pg||
nt|mcphee: proving it is wise to bid those close vul games|pg||
pc|hA|nt|h_karluk: well i didn't get it, sorry, why i am supposed to play 5/2 @s fit? maybe there's still a 5/4 @d fit, so i liked 1NT rebid - just keeps bidding open, i don't think promises a rose ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: garden :)|pg||
nt|pelu: Decl: better play @D first - the @h-suit was locked for defense|pg||
nt|haans: endplay small @D to decl|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|yo_yo: in my day.... none!|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ady: sorry did not see 2@C bid   but was presumably a transfer to 2@D |pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/index.php?option=com_content&task=blogcategory&id=31&Itemid=78|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: it was gazilli or simular|pg||
nt|ady: fortunately for e/w   non vul|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hK|nt|jcwla: This strikes me as a much better example of bidding on a shortness inference.|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|haans: trye|pg||
nt|haans: true|pg||
nt|h_karluk: moysian fit there, however 2@h would be better - i cannot expect much after 2@c NF, double is in not my book in that position|pg||
mc|8|nt|xenya: is that real?|pg||
nt|poohbear: Well done Andy Hung|pg||

nt|yo_yo: 4@S ?|pg||
nt|sybarra: may see it opened 4 @S |pg||
nt|haans: jais made the big error 7nt with no aces 1971|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@S was good bid - great cards - aces are wonderful. Low on points, high on tricks |pg||
nt|han: I think south should have found the heart switch, the @s10 can't mean anything else|pg||
nt|ralfwil: N took a risk here 1H9 mustn´t be on S. he had safe exit-cards|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @h9::|pg||
nt|han: yes indeed Ralf|pg||
mb|1H|nt|yuval10: NS will make a lot of tricks here|pg||
nt|szalay: btw udca is better, cause u cant do this kinda "automatic mistake"|pg||
nt|copeyj: www.jeugdbridge.nl for up to date results and information|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: but E did bid 5@C -- seems that's what W was eager to hear|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: South could have 18+ balanced or any 5-4, passing would be a gamble|pg||
nt|yuval10: cards lie very favourable for them|pg||
nt|h_karluk: umm, slam time for NS|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Israel (holders) leading after an amazing day:  25    25    25    20    22  |pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: wow|pg||
nt|po-s: What was the alert? If some kind of one- or two-suiter, what caused South to bid spades...unless North actually showed spades (or a strong hand in which case it wouldn´t have been ...|pg||
nt|po-s: alerted|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so far Fisher and Tarnovski showed nice performance|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: I'll metion it =)|pg||
nt|han: @hJ looks flashy but wasn't necessary|pg||
mb|2H|nt|haans: 4@S makes with @CK lead|pg||
nt|othered1: 3N?|pg||
nt|haans: by east|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: a + score is good here|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 4/4 or 5/3, in other words which black suit slam :)|pg||
nt|chick: @D7 = beer card ... http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_card|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like an easy game for EW here|pg||
nt|daman: now 3NT by NS unless North wants to convert|pg||
nt|haans: my votes for 2@Hx|pg||
nt|daman: why not    all contracts shouwl be doubled|pg||
nt|daman: should*|pg||
nt|daman: they can get an immediate tap|pg||
nt|haans: click on Competite for Results |pg||
nt|Walddk4: All results (including butlers and hand records) at www.nbbportal.nl/1003/ > 'competitie' --> White House Juniors (line 2) --> 13-18|pg||
nt|copeyj: the double was explained as 5431 short in one of the minors, Po|pg||
nt|Walddk4: is easier|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 22-18 supposedly a part score|pg||
nt|mcphee: land in 2 or a major is my guess here|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i bid 2@@@c smolen here|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i cant see current standings on that website, am i missing something|pg||
nt|h_karluk: we have a 9 cards trump fit and i won't be ashamed when i discovered 4-0 break (10 %)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: we also have 5-1 @d and 6-1 break is 7 %, so interesting layout|pg||
nt|haans: on the strong side|pg||
nt|haans: sorry clubs 89 wrong|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: East alerts 2@D, and passes..|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Do you agree with 3@s on N now?|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
mb|4H|nt|sybarra: http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/index.php?option=com_frontpage&Itemid=76  actually think this one is easier using left hand index |pg||
nt|haans: that overcall vul is WEAK|pg||
nt|han: 1@h - p - 2@h - p and then?|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: I think a tipical mistake to correct in junior age by coach(es): stop slam-greedy|pg||
nt|sybarra: they keep skipping the @S suit, but it is 4333   |pg||
nt|szalay: the imp score is done for GAMES, from both directions|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 21/19 and North lonely cowboy now|pg||
nt|pelu: for me 1NT or 2Nt!|pg||
nt|haans: agree|pg||
nt|ady: would have tht 1NT better from north|pg||
nt|haans: 2@C not forcing|pg||
nt|szalay: that is the reason why in Hungary we tend NOT to lead 4card suit vs. 3N, rather "odd card major"|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: we'll see how low everyone can stay on this board... 3@c and 2M look to be the limits|pg||
nt|haans: that michaes not my cup|pg||
nt|xenya: N got somewhat greedy when he played a small diamond, allowing contract to make, in theory, and that resulted in 2 down  |pg||
nt|copeyj: N/S can make 3NT here I think - but Volcker decided to take his shot at defending|pg||
nt|marlowepi: a  lucky 3N|pg||
nt|sybarra: and an ugly on at that |pg||
nt|yo_yo: the strongest hand hasnt bid yet|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ssh, walls have ears Erwin, aren't we in same team :P|pg||
nt|pierced: 2@h?|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: and whichever suit you pick things not much easy |pg||
nt|sybarra: auction almost screams for major suit lead |pg||
nt|haans: spades not happy|pg||
nt|daman: good to see the players have some red cards in their bidding boxes|pg||
nt|sybarra: *one|pg||
nt|marlowepi: something like an 18% contract, but you just end up there after the normal opening by N|pg||
nt|h_karluk: seems declarer agreed with me|pg||
nt|yo_yo: stayman surely, not smolen|pg||
nt|haans: if they know what they are doing|pg||
nt|ritong: score corrected 11 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: 2@c now cbs- i suppose|pg||
nt|sharkey: NS past their comfort zone |pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: South explained when asked that 3@c shows a good hand|pg||
nt|sharkey: I like 1 NT instead of 3@C|pg||
nt|pelu: sh for sure be a 5 card suit|pg||
nt|frankaus: 4@D will make life difficult|pg||
nt|haans: not easy|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think experienced players would thank to 4@d overcall that alarmed about there's a highly distributional layout|pg||
nt|haans: agree|pg||
nt|haans: but what to lead|pg||
nt|frankaus: i like X here - (t/o) do something sensible |pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/index.php?option=com_frontpage&Itemid=76|pg||
nt|haans: to weak to bid to strong to pass|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: Huh?|pg||
nt|han: I think 4@h is right|pg||
pc|dK|nt|szalay: 1N:15-17 now|pg||
nt|haans: often a make|pg||
nt|mcphee: many pairs play that 2@H now can be any 5-4 major hand|pg||
nt|h_karluk: just a joke|pg||
nt|xenya: not by my standards, but perhaps they treat it differently|pg||
nt|xenya: no, same way|pg||
nt|han: although looking for the 4-4 spade fit may be better|pg||
nt|han: Declarer will win this and attack clubs|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 4@s is an easier contract|pg||
nt|han: then east has a choice, either duck and take no club trick..|pg||
nt|han: or give declarer 2 discards on the clubs|pg||
pc|d2|nt|vugraphzeg: south altered 2c, north didnt|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: alerted:)|pg||
nt|szalay: do they play with screens?|pg||
nt|szalay: what is the website of tourney? can u publish it?|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: yes|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=80&Itemid=72|pg||
nt|szalay: personally I wd pass as West, 2nd in hand in red|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/ and http://www.bridge.nl/|pg||
nt|xenya: thanks Shirley|pg||
nt|xenya: and Jacco :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: Jacco's may be better |pg||
nt|sybarra: mine is participants I see |pg||
nt|szalay: in my book 3@D is NOT forcing, so dunno why West bid on|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Nort has just 5 losers, however no entry to table|pg||
nt|ady: get clubposition will  make life easy|pg||
nt|sybarra: website,  on left you can go to participants, scores etc  |pg||
nt|chick: 2N = unusual (minors in this case), but sacrificing VUL is usually dangerous, and E doesn't have enough for 4@C imo|pg||
nt|chick: and W is sucked in by E's bid to a very risky save|pg||
nt|hawe45:  West is socked in by his own 2 NT-bid - lacking 2-3 key-cards vulnerable|pg||
nt|hawe45:  sucked|pg||
nt|haans: @C) good|pg||
nt|haans: 9|pg||
nt|daman: what is their carding?|pg||
nt|haans: making it easy|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 3N is also making I suppose|pg||
nt|haans: nice|pg||
nt|xenya: it does -- on a @D finesse|pg||
nt|h_karluk: would i pass over 1@s ? :) obviously not, unless there is a very special agreement|pg||
nt|vbman: serious 3nt?|pg||
nt|haans: assume low positive|pg||
nt|haans: france did well here|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|szalay: e-w has their 3rd dangerous bidding so far|pg||
nt|haans: i play 3@C as a prempt|pg||
nt|haans: many beginners believe all new suit bids are forcing even when reponers first say = have weak hand|pg||
nt|ady: diamond back best for now|pg||
nt|haans: standard for 2nt bid to be forcing nowdays|pg||
nt|daman: a spec says udca|pg||
nt|mcphee: N usually bidding 2@S now|pg||
nt|othered1: I don't know EW's overcalling style, but it was a non-space-consuming overcall, vulnerable|pg||
nt|pierced: robert is an activ player :)|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|frankaus: put me down as a pass with Wests hand - aceless 4333 even with 14 i would pass|pg||
nt|szalay: double by South?|pg||
nt|ady: 2 spades and a club it seems|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i play as jump rebid|pg||
nt|haans: clubsa clubs and more clubs|pg||
nt|sybarra: lot of @D to negotiate |pg||
nt|h_karluk: could be, as a passed hand just showed his limit level|pg||
pc|c2|nt|h_karluk: and maybe that was a good reason to begin with a convention - the F******y|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Even green against red it is doubtful|pg||
nt|haans: some very young some not more than 25|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sybarra: welcoms Szalay |pg||
nt|ady: needs to cash club now|pg||
nt|szalay: normal bidding, normal contract, easy make|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 2@h also works - natural|pg||
nt|yuval10: with some overtricks|pg||
nt|pelu: Howard 8Australia) after same start bid 1Nt in N|pg||
nt|szalay: Brigitta became a bit pessimistic abroad|pg||
nt|szalay: so here @S lead for us...the best one|pg||
nt|szalay: @D fulfills it|pg||
nt|szalay: as bridgeplayer I wd like to watch @S lerad...as Hungarian @D:)|pg||
nt|szalay: lead|pg||
nt|daman: that was not a great switch|pg||
nt|haans: @C) = lavinthal|pg||
nt|haans: 9|pg||
nt|po-s: A bit lucky - to find South with the two minor queens|pg||
nt|haans: @h neutral so best|pg||
nt|po-s: if garbage stayman, 44 is enough|pg||
nt|yo_yo: so the Aussies now in action|pg||
nt|yo_yo: are they brothers?  brother and sister?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think NS adopted some sturdy program, i liked their strategy to win, just do not adventure. that's cool|pg||
nt|vbman: or unserious 3 nt|pg||
nt|vbman: some play it the other way |pg||
pc|cK|nt|sybarra: Jacco's first web site, you can see the beautiful facility |pg||
nt|szalay: he has 2 aces, pd had shown values, they bypassed 3n...SO|pg||
nt|rnmalik: good lead|pg||
nt|szalay: odd card major, u know:)|pg||
nt|szalay: but are few exceptions what I dont tell u know...we need some secret weapons:)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: so is @H in E:)|pg||
nt|szalay: unbid oddcard major, to be specific|pg||
nt|rnmalik: ok|pg||
nt|yuval10: red suit lead will give declarer his 9th trick, not that he can't develope one in @s anyway...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: interestingly, in 3N you want the club king onside, but in 5D you want the opening leader to have it:)|pg||
nt|mcphee: yes just try to get out of the crummy NT spot|pg||
nt|yo_yo: twins?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: brothers,  thanks|pg||
nt|yo_yo: in fact how many females are in this competition?|pg||
nt|mcphee: good lead this trump|pg||
nt|yo_yo: maybe the operator can tell us?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: opps have 6 cards in @h/@s suit, as expected 4-2  48%, so 2@s good choice while they had 5/2?|pg||
nt|po-s: it is called girls, not females|pg||
nt|mcphee: the point is they do not know for sure if @H is 5-2|pg||
nt|h_karluk: juniors|pg||
nt|po-s: Or possibly women|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think after 2@c it's guaranteed 5/4 weak|pg||
nt|yo_yo: most women arent offended by being called female, PO|pg||
nt|mcphee: using stayman in this fashion declarer may hold 5@S and 4@H even and a weak hand|pg||
nt|yo_yo: and girls , to my mind , grow to be women about the age of 18|pg||
nt|mcphee: as many treat 2@S in that sequence as invitational values|pg||
nt|mcphee: containng both majors|pg||
nt|h_karluk: okay, however when our Ladies team won we say wd girlz, and they say ty boyz :)|pg||
nt|mcphee: the only good thing about this hand is he is not down yet|pg||
nt|h_karluk: just curiosity, how come N neglected S is short in @s, could be void and bid twice to his pass while he has nice @c fit|pg||
nt|haans: now 4 clubs and maybe @DJ get a trick|pg||
nt|petergill: Scores after 21 rounds at http://www.nbbportal.nl/1003/ then click on Competitie then on White House Juniors in middle|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|haans: with 4-2 draw trumfs and play nt|pg||
nt|chick: as a kib points out, E may want to double 4@S as well|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: quite the aggresive type of lady..|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: well, takes a @h lead to make 3N on the @d finesse|pg||
nt|yo_yo: he was clever|pg||
nt|yo_yo: he looked at the vulnerability|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://nbbuitslagen.transfer-solutions.com/uss/goPage30.do?rndid=74915&verid=805&start=21  for standings after 21 rounds|pg||
nt|petergill: Four teams only 8 VPS apart at the top - Israel, Australia 2nd, France and Italy 4th, several other teams close up too|pg||
nt|Walddk4: That's easier, Peter|pg||
nt|petergill: Thanks Roland|pg||
pc|h3|nt|vugraphzeg: I made the classic mistake 4 and A|pg||
nt|szalay: hi all|pg||
nt|ady: hi|pg||
nt|sybarra: has to be careful now not to lose a @S |pg||
nt|rnmalik: hi and welcome|pg||
nt|haans: have x for mopre cards|pg||
nt|pelu: nu lead can defeat 3Nt - 3!X then u set up 3 @D-tricks = 9|pg||
nt|ady: with hearts 4-4  heart lead would not beat the contract  defence take 3 hearts and 1 diamond|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Facing a vulnerable 2 NT, East can only see 3 losers|pg||
pc|hK|nt|h_karluk: depends agreements just use 2@d or 2@h, and make things easier|pg||
nt|szalay: btw @H beats it as well|pg||
nt|rnmalik: It makes only on @D lead|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I mean as the cards are|pg||
nt|szalay: Hope can lead @S back, cause sure partner has T: otherwise declarer wd play small from dummy, probably|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: Hop asking questions about possible distribution|pg||
nt|szalay: some spec suggested @C lead is ok as well: to be honest I dont lead opps suit from Txx...NEVER|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: of declarer's hand|pg||
nt|szalay: declerer could have 4card @S|pg||
nt|szalay: his bid just denies 4card @H|pg||
nt|haans: now can raise hearts|pg||
nt|haans: no sry|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i can see ;6 tricks|pg||
nt|mcphee: low @C?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: mebbe i could never get an answer, just online..but i would ask this question to player if that was a face to face event|pg||
pc|hA|nt|szalay: to bid games, take tricks...and double games when they r in vuln and we see the chance|pg||
nt|sybarra: it is a reburbished tennis club (still active tennis courts) and quite a terrific bridge facility also |pg||
nt|haans: many  mean 3n to show two cards in opening suit|pg||
nt|yuval10: now only @h will limit declarer to 10|pg||
nt|daman: tempo is everything|pg||
nt|vbman: makes 5|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so far @d K favorably placed. no trump problem, and a working @c finesse|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 11-15 5@h+4@s stuff|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: made a mistake when correcting the first score|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: was 1 off|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: dummy is getting tapped, and this should be down one too many I believe|pg||
nt|yuval10: can make 10 now|pg||
nt|h_karluk: bear in mind both vul|pg||
pc|d4|nt|yuval10: otherwise 12 tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like that, yes|pg||
nt|xenya: but this seems to give declarer a break|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ady: this not definately making from south's point of view|pg||
nt|ady: if south plays K@H now then will be much better placed|pg||
nt|szalay: do u see any reason for small @D?|pg||
nt|szalay: except blocking suit?|pg||
nt|szalay: and to give fals impression to pd?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  West might refret the small @D - but we do not know their methods|pg||
nt|szalay: I am informed Hungarian defender started @S as well|pg||
nt|szalay: he learnt his lesson well, wd:)|pg||
nt|szalay: I believe to lead small from Qx is technically bad|pg||
nt|szalay: when dummy has 76xx|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I agree adds to confusion for the P|pg||
nt|szalay: small @D back wd be a punishment...|pg||
nt|szalay: but:|pg||
nt|szalay: who has J of @S?|pg||
nt|szalay: surely West|pg||
nt|szalay: otherwise declarer wd play small, not Q|pg||
nt|szalay: at trick 1|pg||
nt|szalay: so @S is a 100% lead|pg||
nt|haans: back to teaching|pg||
nt|mcphee: not an easy defence really is it|pg||
nt|mcphee: low @C to J not a bad plan |pg||
pc|h4|nt|h_karluk: everything is on the right spot for NS|pg||
nt|haans: we have all seen better defense|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and North should see there's likely no more than a trick in @c suit|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so far i found N has interesting hand evaluation ideas|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|szalay: I was there..in February..I remember was terrible cold and windy|pg||
nt|haans: say ty opps|pg||
nt|ady: but east can get 2 spade ruffs|pg||
nt|pelu: yes: @Sk - @s ruff - @c to A and @S ruff|pg||
nt|haans: to strong for flannery|pg||
nt|yuval10: by guessing @s, which isn't such a big guess...|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ady: K@S   spade ruff   then trump back and another spade ruff|pg||
pc|s7|nt|daman: the @C 9  and @D 6 seem to be suit preference for @Ss :)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|h_karluk: i think Bobby Goldman described well what to do in his book Aces Scientific with 5/4 or 5/5 weak/strong M holdings|pg||
nt|vbman: l dont want to be an italian junior|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|h_karluk: maybe the software allows you to correct it anytime, i think Roland is good at that|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: could S maybe chuck the Q@C on the king?|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: needs partner to have all the intermediate clubs though|pg||
nt|h_karluk: plus @h honour cards good enough to resist|pg||
nt|haans: diamond ruff 1 down|pg||
nt|yo_yo: he needs a @D ruff|pg||
nt|othered1: Nice position for defense|pg||
nt|han: An alternative line would have been the crossruff|pg||
pc|d8|nt|h_karluk: to me ideal F-----y|pg||
nt|sybarra: should be fairly certain now that spdes are 3/3|pg||
nt|haans: Poland takes the lead|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ady: now making 11|pg||
nt|rnmalik: as the cards we see +1 now|pg||
nt|h_karluk: because the hand does not contain reverse values|pg||
nt|chick: well, they may get out for down only 1|pg||
nt|po-s: this was a bad plan since now defenders won´t have a problem....shouldn´t|pg||
pc|h6|nt|vbman: who is anticipated to follow the best history of bridge|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|ady: sorry  Peter you were first|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: Bas van Beijsterveldt helped me :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: congrats :)|pg||
nt|haans: Hi Erwin|pg||
nt|frankaus: will make 12 i expect|pg||
nt|haans: decl do not know how to play @H|pg||
nt|po-s: North should have a pretty good club suit after his spade bid|pg||
nt|xenya: yes -- and N gets another chance|pg||
pc|s4|nt|vugraphzeg: claimed too early|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: quite messy at the table |pg||
pc|s8|nt|yo_yo: could you be thinking of hand 1?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: commentated for this one |pg||
pc|sK|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|pelu: normal u dont give distribution i trumf, but here it would help W if he know that pd has even No|pg||
nt|han: declarer could ruff a club, cash the spades and then ruff diamond, club, diamond, club|pg||
pc|h5|nt|haans: nice fighting|pg||
pc|h8|nt|haans: and loses it|pg||
nt|sybarra: and about to be well done by declarer?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sybarra: easy now |pg||
nt|hawe45:  West should know, that when declarer plays @S Queen from dummy, East PROBABLY has the 10!|pg||
nt|tomi2: thinking here just makes you angry if you lose the imp if finesse is working, but he will take the ace anyway|pg||
nt|petergill: good defence I think|pg||
pc|hT|pg||

nt|h_karluk: esp when u r a passed hand|pg||
nt|yuval10: indeed, 2@c is invitational |pg||
nt|h_karluk: i agree with 3@c rebid, invite or better, i can live with that 5 losers, no matter entry to table, i know no need to cry when they sets, favorable vuln was another tempting factor|pg||
nt|haans: right u r|pg||
nt|haans: not bad|pg||
nt|pelu: west has a 5 loser-hand - and his pd has 0 tricks for him! :(|pg||
nt|szalay: rehi|pg||
nt|ady: west may open some sort of weak 2|pg||
nt|daman: they should gain at least 3 IMPs    800 was there for the taking|pg||
nt|haans: @C9 acceptable of play low enc|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: so George, which contract will we end up (doubled) in now?|pg||
nt|daman: @D Ace was fatal|pg||
nt|daman: hhrrrmmmm|pg||
nt|po-s: ow THIS is what bI ncall a Michaels - if West had opened|pg||
nt|haans: all the way|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: Bessis is laughing about the pass of his partner|pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry meant 3/2,  obviously early in morning for me |pg||
nt|haans: easy make :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: a tough contract|pg||
nt|mcphee: do you think he was lucky to escape for 1 down?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: previous board 2@h met same destiny|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes i think so|pg||
nt|mcphee: me too|pg||
nt|yo_yo: I didnt forsee that 2nd @D trick|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 25-15 now we may see a game try|pg||
nt|h_karluk: very little possibility that he was not sure for 5@c nonvul then preferred 3@s x -2 in vuln|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 25-25 therem who knows NS would try something smart|pg||
nt|yo_yo: well it paid to be cautious in the  bidding there   WD Wiankowski|pg||
nt|haans: instructing deal|pg||
nt|sybarra: probably should never had the 10 of @D in declarer's hand  |pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: commentators curse strikes immediatly:(|pg||
nt|ady: re|pg||
nt|szalay: but East knew J of @S for sure|pg||
nt|haans: 4@H?|pg||
nt|daman: no doubled contracts this time|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 26 vs 14, could be interesting board|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but the aussies missed a chance|pg||
nt|sybarra: might bang down from the top |pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: Lotan doesn't understand it, and says it was easy|pg||
nt|petergill: i think the reason declarer rejected the obvious play of @H to Q at Trick 2, ruff a spade, club to ten is that it seems to only ever lead to 9 tricks. |pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: if he wasn't passed hand then 2@d would've been GF|pg||
nt|pierced: 2@d |pg||
mb|1D|nt|szalay: in that case I wd go out for water, to refresh myself|pg||
nt|ady: an easy 3NT  played by south|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes|pg||
nt|sharkey: E has the "perfect" Dbl hand|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 23-17 this time, another interesting board|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: they even played after the claim..|pg||
nt|szalay: Frenchmen are very conservative with 4card other major|pg||
nt|ady: at least 10 tricks in hearts for e/w|pg||
nt|ady: west decided not to open|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Also, yes|pg||
nt|szalay: logic is more important than defence agreements|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: 4@s?|pg||
nt|daman: I might have to eat my words :)|pg||
nt|daman: yes|pg||
nt|haans: yes full standard|pg||
nt|sybarra: great slam here |pg||
nt|haans: good 3@H|pg||
nt|mcphee: pretty easy 4@H here|pg||
nt|othered1: that's a friendly partner for you|pg||
nt|haans: old Baron style|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: He told it when the screen was closed again|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: can they make 6@D|pg||
nt|vbman: tx|pg||
nt|pierced: will be the contract|pg||
mb|1H|nt|h_karluk: uh oh. 1@s ? hmmm :)|pg||
nt|pelu: his problem was the 4 card @s|pg||
nt|ady: west wasting no time  4@D  is for hearts|pg||
nt|szalay: I agree with xfer to 4@H: IF we have weak 6card and strong 4card major, kinda stayman is preferred|pg||
nt|szalay: in Hungary we had a 1st class teacher/player in 60s, called Lajos Widder|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 2NT in N for minor|pg||
nt|szalay: his favourite proverb was: "I hate maths...only important thing is: all players has 13 cards and all color has 13"|pg||
nt|daman: I must admit    I would have bid 2@H with the West hand|pg||
nt|haans: both makes|pg||
nt|daman: 1@S seemed timid|pg||
nt|chick: too strong for Michaels|pg||
nt|daman: no way|pg||
nt|chick: 1@S, then 2@D shows the hand much better|pg||
nt|haans: best is 5@H now|pg||
nt|daman: classic Michaels|pg||
nt|h_karluk: kinda cake and walk|pg||
nt|haans: baron 1nt from the 40th|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: 3 NT|pg||
nt|copeyj: great grand|pg||
nt|haans: many play X showing minimum|pg||
nt|mcphee: oh some relay hand type with 2@C|pg||
nt|h_karluk: likely S will dictate for 4@h|pg||
nt|othered1: is there a strength limit, up or down, to south's 1N?|pg||
nt|haans: weakish|pg||
nt|haans: double with stronger hand|pg||
nt|petergill: Even 2@C looks like going down, if the defence is good. |pg||
mb|1S|nt|szalay: terrible slam, imho|pg||
nt|rnmalik: a @C can be pitched on @S but they dont know:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: likely to play 2 @H's here|pg||
nt|szalay: in Hungary we play Michaels a bit different way than World do|pg||
nt|szalay: NOT weak or strong, rather "at least inv values, no upper limit"|pg||
nt|haans: gazzilli|pg||
nt|haans: anything but 2@D is weak|pg||
nt|sybarra: a grand even but is it biddable  (7 @D?)|pg||
nt|othered1: where does this hand fall in their range, do you think?|pg||
nt|haans: 12 13 max 14|pg||
nt|othered1: so this is way below maximum|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: 1NT=7-12|pg||
nt|h_karluk: NS losers are 2@h, 1@d and a @s, they have 23 hcp, let's see their best|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: dont they play Drury?|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: During the white house juniors very nice weather last few years|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: Dennis Bilde had his moment on the first board. now 1 highpoint average over 3|pg||
nt|haans: best game 3nt but ...|pg||
nt|szalay: Lazar could NOT bid 3@D as P/C, cause its inv with @S|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i guess W accept invitation, wldn't decline|pg||
nt|yo_yo: well stopped by NS  |pg||
mb|2H|nt|frankaus: water? - do u know what fish do in water :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: those hands are usually easy to bid :)|pg||
nt|ady: natural    should have had a 5th club|pg||
nt|haans: no way to show @D :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: how about pass :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: he already had 3@c in his hand..|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: practically|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Yes - E/W need a quiet board|pg||
nt|szalay: I think South's hand is close to 2N, imho|pg||
nt|daman: hard to bid 2@D over 3@H|pg||
nt|chick: Michaels is a preemptive bid, he does not need to preempt|pg||
nt|haans: 3@H usually no defensive tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: so 3@D is natural and weak?|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: yes|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 2@s would show a non-constructive raise I suppose, so he has to bid 3@d. N can now bid 4@h which will be corrected to 4@s and that should be the final contract|pg||
nt|haans: yep 2@D is GF|pg||
nt|haans: if p is strong|pg||
nt|haans: any bid now strong hand|pg||
nt|copeyj: 7NT on ice - and they will bid it no problem|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes 7 mnt also |pg||
nt|copeyj: when south gets to ask for aces|pg||
nt|haans: rkc show @DQ and off|pg||
nt|marlowepi: generally disappointing to be in 4th seat when holding a hand like N, but here she gets to bid before EW have shown spades anyway|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: I have there system notes here, but needed to look it up :)\|pg||
nt|han: I must admit I would have opened with the east hand here|pg||
nt|han: the suit isn't great (although the spots are nice)|pg||
nt|han: but I love the 6-4 shape|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: kibs asking 6@D      can make    but bad contract  |pg||
nt|h_karluk: no way|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: but last moment rethink :P|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No - Jacks are doubtful values and 3-3-3-4|pg||
nt|daman: michaels is a descriptive bid    doesn't have to be preemptive at all|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: what a sad way to end a bidding|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 3@d is the worst thing Adam can hear, maybe 3@h is even enough|pg||
nt|po-s: 2spades would not be constructive at all|pg||
nt|haans: 3@S slaminvite?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: agrees @H probably|pg||
nt|xenya: 3N is makeable but hard to get their intellligently|pg||
nt|xenya: *there|pg||
nt|petergill: North has to decide who has the singleton and who has three @d's|pg||
nt|petergill: As East has longer clubs than South, East is favourite to have the shorter @ds|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: I think 9 hcp with ruffing values is more than regular 10 hcp|pg||
nt|ady: 2@S  2nd negative|pg||
nt|pelu: great bid!|pg||
nt|haans: clubs lead ?|pg||
nt|szalay: I think 6@C is very optimistic, especially in all white|pg||
nt|szalay: all white is NOT a position where u need be greedy|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|chick: that's the normal way to play it ... preemptive or 18+ ... but of course you can do as you like :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Do you get a bonus when you have 14 top tricks?|pg||
nt|sybarra: and "flops" well as Henri would say |pg||
nt|haans: easiest grand in a long time|pg||
nt|copeyj: he will be able to count 12 tops|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3nt is far easier on that board|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i suppose 4@S would be defeated? |pg||
nt|yo_yo: but if they dont cash out  the @H can be set up|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 2x2 m losers|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes must be slam invite|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Ed Shapiro|pg||
nt|haans: on the weak side|pg||
nt|othered1: very easy, maybe too easy, plus here|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: likely 11 tricks, next one|pg||
nt|ady: trump switch  will hold to 10|pg||
nt|marlowepi: many would bid 4H nonvul since EW have not found their spades yet|pg||
nt|yo_yo: here we go|pg||
nt|han: same contract|pg||
pc|c3|nt|rnmalik: agree was an observation|pg||
nt|pelu: 9½ out of 10 will lead @S|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|pelu: ½ lead @d! :)|pg||
nt|ady: natrual spade lead 9 tricks    this likely to be a swing for Australia|pg||
nt|Walddk4: All results (including butlers and hand records) at www.nbbportal.nl/1003/ > 'competitie'|pg||
nt|szalay: r u sure?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No intermediats|pg||
nt|rnmalik: N found no defense to 5@H and has settled for -2 as we see|pg||
nt|chick: I wonder what the difference between that sequence and 1N 3N is|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like 3NT has 9 tricks via 3@s , 2@h, 2@d and 2@c|pg||
nt|xenya: this rates to make  think|pg||
nt|haans: my guess 2@S 2nt replacement|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, Hans|pg||
nt|copeyj: and his part must have osmething extra for 15-17|pg||
nt|vbman: lets see if they venture for something higher|pg||
nt|vbman: completing the picture|pg||
pc|c7|nt|szalay: important thing after bad boards: leave table for a while and reconnect:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: All Israels I know play drury, maybe west didnt think his hand was good enough\|pg||
nt|ady: club lead will need spades 3-3 to pitch losing club   and heart lead will need king well placed|pg||
nt|sybarra: wrongsided this one|pg||
nt|frankaus: 3nt will make with the   @HJshort|pg||
nt|pelu: no|pg||
nt|szalay: trump LEAD does it|pg||
nt|ady: sorry   meant trump lead|pg||
nt|szalay: cause North could lead 2nd one|pg||
nt|szalay: I think to lead trump is close to suiced from South's seat|pg||
nt|rnmalik: and no DBL|pg||
nt|szalay: of course, it could make for 3-3 @S, but: in that case 5@HX is at least 500, can be 800|pg||
nt|szalay: I dont like to save|pg||
nt|szalay: I like when WE score|pg||
nt|haans: direct 5@H more angry|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and maybe natural way was easy to reach 4@h |pg||
nt|yo_yo: dont think!|pg||
nt|han: the play of this hand is not so interesting|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Walddk4: He will get @CK after 5NT now and can count 13|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: Thomas came here yesterday, from Reno, and he had to go with plane to Paris and then with Train here... |pg||
nt|mcphee: n/s will need to grab those tricks or possible they will go away|pg||
nt|mcphee: uh oh|pg||
nt|jcwla: That problem solved...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: friendly neighbor lead. solved 2 way finesse problem quickly|pg||
nt|h_karluk: N already limitted his hand, not hard for S to guess rest|pg||
nt|vbman: 3h shows some h tolerance?|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|haans: weak responder 2 jacks|pg||
nt|haans: easy to raise @D|pg||
nt|xenya: this may be a swing as pass by W over 1N is a fair option|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|xenya: not for juniors perhaps though|pg||
nt|daman: http://www.bridgeguys.com/Conventions/MichaelsCuebid.html|pg||
nt|po-s: Did I forget system now ? what has he shown???|pg||
nt|mcphee: E has pushed the envelope|pg||
nt|h_karluk: uh oh seems W's 3@s caused some misunderstanding there|pg||
nt|ritong: @c is the only possible suit to lead, though|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, everyone|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hi ed|pg||
nt|sybarra: gm Ed |pg||
nt|haans: Hi Ed|pg||
nt|han: double dummy declarer might be able to get 140 by pitching clubs on the diamonds|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 8 tricks after a @c ruff on N|pg||
nt|han: but since that risks the contract, there is no need|pg||
pc|s2|nt|vugraphzeg: kleine kamer|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think an imaginary problem there : say east has AQ96-KT983-7-J42, okay guys, would bid 1@h or still double over 1@d? my opinion : if East wld X with that  hand then 2@d cue by W ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: gr8 :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: Probably take @C finesse and end up with 11 tricks|pg||
nt|szalay: and his pd has strong hand: give her the last decision:)|pg||
nt|haans: they have a diamond loser|pg||
nt|haans: i think 2@S had been a better bid|pg||
nt|po-s: nor is any bid except 2D - except possibly in some partnerships: 2H|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: right, I meant like xxx xxx KQxx xxx or something|pg||
nt|haans: well 3@D did say no slam today|pg||
nt|vbman: so an action is sensible|pg||
nt|h_karluk: S can afford to concede 2 @h trick |pg||
nt|haans: that slaminvite risky|pg||
pc|s3|nt|daman: it's all in there|pg||
nt|yo_yo: what system do they play?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that's the question|pg||
nt|mcphee: what ever it is someone bid too mcuh|pg||
nt|ritong: since opponents have at least a four carder in the three others|pg||
nt|petergill: and if South had short @d's, that would leave a lot of spades for South|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|vugraphzeg: oops that was personal|pg||
nt|ady: clubs blocked fortunately|pg||
nt|sybarra: so you get lucky sometimes |pg||
nt|ady: east condiering unblocking  hoping 10@C with west|pg||
nt|h_karluk: with that junk even they show me full hands i could not dare to land 3@c|pg||
nt|haans: @CJ not cover not two entries to dummy|pg||
nt|copeyj: Volcker didnt bother|pg||
nt|haans: i say flat board|pg||
nt|copeyj: grand likely to be laydown, and very few hands from north could make it a bad grand i guess|pg||
nt|po-s: It seems Thomas has travelled the world - he has forgotten that in France it is forbidden to open 1NT with a 5card major|pg||
nt|copeyj: guillotine offence isn't it, Po?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Not among juniors, PO|pg||
nt|sybarra: must be only in france, no 5 card majors in 1 nt?|pg||
nt|po-s: T plays with his dad mostly, don´t forget|pg||
nt|sybarra: if he opens 1 @S, doesnt have a good rebid |pg||
nt|haans: in sweden we have had 5c M for 60 years in 1nt|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Worst case scenario is @CQJ, @HJ and @SJ|pg||
nt|yo_yo: and has West shown a NT shape?|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|chick: lack of intermediates is what I see as the big problem -- half of S's hand is 5 or below|pg||
nt|Walddk4: And then the grand still has play|pg||
nt|h_karluk: dangerous height|pg||
pc|h2|nt|po-s: probably the Hockey club|pg||
nt|mcphee: :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 2@c+1@d obvious losers|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and leader has not much difficulty to cash|pg||
nt|mcphee: S has no other defence than to cash out really|pg||
nt|yo_yo: well i wondered when Kopecky reached that game earlier, if they would over reach soon|pg||
nt|h_karluk: say N has side suit values as opener|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ruffing potential extra power|pg||
nt|sybarra: interesting club pips |pg||
pc|h3|nt|h_karluk: likely 10 IMPs|pg||
nt|h_karluk: why not a @s ? yr long suit, declarer could have gaps there |pg||
nt|h_karluk: pitching a @d seems reasonable now, serves to ruff in th future|pg||
nt|petergill: I think North did well not to falsecard with @C9|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|VugraphPl1: http://michzimny.pl/bridge/2010/pila/gp.html|pg||
nt|ady: back to 10 maybe|pg||
nt|szalay: why @D?|pg||
nt|xenya: same 9 tricks in 2@D|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|ady: good play that unforunately gets no reward|pg||
nt|sybarra: valiant try |pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: both north and south complimented east|pg||
nt|sharkey: I wud bid 1@H|pg||
nt|haans: me 2|pg||
nt|hawe45:  North now asks himself: WHY did I take that trick?|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, declarer can't set up the long suit, so he should take Yuval's line|pg||
nt|xenya: and that's what he is doing it seems|pg||
nt|mcphee: this seems to be E being a bit too pushy I think|pg||
nt|po-s: If I bid four suits, of course I have a four-suited hand|pg||
nt|yo_yo: I guess Nabil will realise he has 3 tricks|pg||
nt|h_karluk: another interesting point, East had a chance to read W's length, say A att, K count in their sys card and std methods|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so controls minor attacks|pg||
nt|yo_yo: well partner could be max|pg||
nt|haans: once in 100|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i like that 5 card suit|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ady: yes|pg||
nt|szalay: its risky|pg||
nt|szalay: @C/@S is sure exit|pg||
nt|rnmalik: flat board|pg||
nt|szalay: when we need just 1 trick to set: lead safe is a basic rule|pg||
nt|szalay: just interchange Q and J of @D why was it terrible try|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so new score after this board expected as 23-0|pg||
nt|vbman: need to ruff|pg||
pc|s4|nt|h_karluk: so that matters, 1@h just F1 fine|pg||
nt|haans: but how to get it|pg||
nt|ritong: it happens that east showed length in it|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and west refused to support|pg||
nt|ritong: then what?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: could transfer the ruff|pg||
nt|sybarra: better for poker maybe |pg||
nt|yo_yo: however partner wasnt max so they stayed low|pg||
pc|s7|nt|h_karluk: i meant in @d suit|pg||
nt|yo_yo: North isnt trying!|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but  he can see his contract   i suppose|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @h J favorably placed as an insurance in case they landed as Vladimir pointed out|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|sharkey: Think better let @C9 run as N pegged with @CA|pg||
nt|haans: or transfer bids|pg||
nt|haans: let overcaller lead :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: next...|pg||
nt|haans: best with void opps can not count their tricks|pg||
nt|marlowepi: on this deal 4HX would go for too much though|pg||
nt|ritong: the target in no trump is to establish long winners, mind you|pg||
nt|othered1: as cards lie, trump back looks like only chance to limit declarer's tricks.  but that's to beat 4, not 2|pg||
nt|petergill: the falsecard @C9 might help West get the trumps right|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: east you mean|pg||
pc|h9|nt|Walddk4: Nah|pg||
nt|h_karluk: well, still 2 clubs losers, but who knows East may play another @h and N claims|pg||
nt|petergill: Best not ro "ruff air" with a trump winner|pg||
pc|h8|nt|vugraphzeg: I can't claim before they do|pg||
nt|pelu: we have a real top-match on here: France 1 = No 2 (126 VP after 6 matches) and NL Blue No 3 (113)|pg||
pc|dT|nt|szalay: after this bidding trump lead is nearly automatic, imho|pg||
nt|tomi2: leading away from @SA here just gives away the tempr|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|haans: had no reason to play @CK|pg||
nt|haans: 1 clubs loser deep finesse|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 10-13|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|chick: and I quote:  " the accepted point count should be between 5 high card points and 11 high card points, although the strength is again a matter of the partnership agreement."|pg||
nt|h_karluk: no tranportation problem there|pg||
pc|h4|nt|szalay: but Aces ar Aces:)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But you will find many 15/16 HCP-hands, who are stronger|pg||
pc|s5|nt|h_karluk: sorry |pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|h_karluk: oh transpopsed, declarer claims after ruffs a @h|pg||

pc|hA|pc|dJ|pc|h5|pg||
mc|9|nt|xenya: the defence can't establish enought tricks, so declarer can develop slow tricks at his leisure|pg||

nt|hawe45:  but only 12 tricks|pg||

nt|haans: 13 14 in my book|pg||
nt|chick: and since this was not unfavorable vulnerability ... :)|pg||
nt|haans: fast play|pg||
nt|sybarra: when you get past 13.....claim |pg||

nt|h_karluk: truce :)|pg||
nt|haans: missed game|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: EW fighting for some reason|pg||
nt|othered1: not that I'd expect that to be bid.  Needs very friendly lie|pg||
nt|pierced: for not , hands arent very interesting|pg||
nt|xenya: ruff, draw and claim |pg||
nt|pierced: now*|pg||
nt|yuval10: maybe now a little bit more|pg||
nt|h_karluk: maybe preempts would decide to winner|pg||
nt|haans: got @CJ instead|pg||
nt|petergill: Yes, East, although Juzz Howard West would like to declare every hand if he could. |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: yes|pg||
nt|po-s: overtricks?|pg||
nt|haans: will 6@S work|pg||
nt|sybarra: need to get a breath of fresh air maybe,  on the beautiful paito |pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 20-20 again|pg||
nt|yuval10: S will be surprised to see his P opening|pg||
nt|h_karluk: just hook @h K and have fun|pg||
nt|szalay: I wd use exclusion RKC after xfer by South: 4@D-4@H-4@S/N (depends on RKC-style)|pg||
nt|h_karluk:  3 S had 0, now E has 1|pg||
nt|ady: 20-20 |pg||
nt|ady: however Netherlands got the 7 imps back hand 2  geting to game  where France stopped in 2NT|pg||
nt|daman: duh|pg||
nt|mcphee: well smashing 5@D looked like a good idea at the time for E I suppose:)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that's a shame for the Czechs  |pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think EW wld pop-up to 3N|pg||
nt|tomi2: he hoped to find partner on 4 clubs and set up a trick there... but i think he will never think of this leading problem again|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @S earned Oz, 4 imps|pg||
nt|othered1: anyone respond with north hand, vul?|pg||
nt|othered1: Some say never to pass with 5-card major.  I'd pass.|pg||
nt|yuval10: EW can actually make some game here|pg||
nt|pierced: in OR they will open 2@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzeg: south had 1 on 4 aswell and 2 on 2|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but a shot in the arm for the Aussies|pg||
mb|1S|nt|h_karluk: pass by E?|pg||
nt|haans: agree with that pass|pg||
nt|szalay: btw I wd bid 3N immediately here: dont give them chance for right lead |pg||
nt|szalay: slam is very unlikely|pg||
nt|ady: n/s haved a choice   5@C  or 3NT     3NT scores better|pg||
nt|pelu: the 8. @C is the key-card for direct 3Nt - u dont need an H in @C from pd|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @S-lead might bring 480|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No...|pg||
nt|szalay: it requires a perfect sys and silent opps to bid it|pg||
nt|hawe45:  So am I - no double is OK|pg||
nt|szalay: 6+5+2=13|pg||
nt|haans: all jumps are not weak :)|pg||
nt|daman: on with the show|pg||
nt|copeyj: normal 4@S here for N/S|pg||
nt|copeyj: wonder what thomas will chose|pg||
nt|sybarra: think I will stay in 4 and hope for the OT|pg||
nt|haans: vul but off u go|pg||
nt|h_karluk: olperator, what's the alert please? any explanation|pg||
nt|jcwla: A predictable gain (9) to Israel on 11 -- they played 3@SX-1 in OR.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: decent 11 at S|pg||
nt|haans: does Fisher know what 2@H mean?|pg||
nt|pierced: it will be hard for lhuissier to fing the lead here|pg||
mb|d|nt|haans: easy to get -800|pg||
nt|mcphee: i think I might well take a swing at 5@D also|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Kopecky will be bent on revenge and might well double them also|pg||
nt|yo_yo: East is worth a try with 18 count|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: 2nt is weak with diamonds says north so they know what they are doiing|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i am not a fan of opening balanced 11 counts however|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|ady: e/w have 9 tricks in spades as they lay|pg||
nt|yuval10: indeed, if 4@s is exclusion |pg||
nt|szalay: bid 6 or 7 depends on answer|pg||
nt|sharkey: Wonder if S knows what to do with all the points  - he'll probably drop stiff @SK to maje 4@S|pg||
nt|sharkey: *make|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and that's 10 boards sets, presumably predealt hands|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think that's wild|pg||
nt|sharkey: S may raise...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think i wld bid 3@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: he did, west goes into the tank now|pg||
nt|haans: west  do not promise @SK|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i dislike 3@d with 16 there|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - Vul at IMPs think it's right|pg||
nt|pelu: 2Nt = I can help in @c|pg||
nt|pelu: what can S bid now ? X for @S-stop?|pg||
nt|ady: not sure it right to settle for 3NT  switch K@D with A! north and west  then 6@C makes and 3NT down 1|pg||
nt|ady: k@D   and A@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: double on 2@S? Would  anybody else do that?|pg||
nt|ady: no   |pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: maybe my question also gives my opinion :)|pg||
nt|pelu: no X - in my book 5-card - or very strong 4-card suit - u can exp that pd bid 4@S over 3NT|pg||
nt|haans: stay low here|pg||
nt|haans: look 2+ is ALERTED all to learn|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: not alerted by Adam by the way.. but then again, he has so many|pg||
nt|haans: :) most forget it|pg||
nt|haans: going slamming|pg||
nt|copeyj: 4@C = shortage in @C game values 4@S|pg||
nt|h_karluk: with @s stoppers, picked his natural way|pg||
nt|jcwla: Back in a bit.|pg||
nt|ritong: 3@h looks correct|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i guess N would winds up with 3N|pg||
nt|ritong: leaving several options open, including 6@d|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: sorry was a misclick|pg||
nt|han: Well, 4@s did go down on the second hand we saw|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 4@s if E can find @cQ|pg||
nt|han: I imagine that 2@h is a good spade raise|pg||
nt|han: it is fairly common to play transfers here|pg||
nt|han: for example, 1NT shows clubs, 2C shows diamonds, 2D shows hearts, 2H is a good spade raise and 2S is a bad spade raise|pg||
nt|ralfwil: this D will help declarer when he can see @dK and @dJ on N|pg||
mb|d|nt|haans: trash Stayman|pg||
nt|copeyj: wont make Volcker excited|pg||
nt|h_karluk: thank you|pg||
nt|haans: very few juniors play walsh trf|pg||
nt|haans: but here is one|pg||
mb|4S|nt|sharkey: Wud you pass and hope they land in NT?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: thanks Dennis :)|pg||
nt|haans: but give east a @D ruff then...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: now i pass to 4@d|pg||
nt|sharkey: After 1 NT opening West likely to be on lead anyway|pg||
nt|haans: and they are non vul|pg||
nt|pelu: I am with u Tim|pg||
nt|szalay: 2N: 14+, bal|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Yes - back to my first view|pg||
nt|szalay: 2@D was nat and GF|pg||
nt|xenya: NS might get in trouble now|pg||
nt|yuval10: 3@d by N perhaps?|pg||
nt|haans: 2@H = strong hand|pg||
nt|henryb:  pass perhaps?|pg||
nt|xenya: but just might -- N can rebid @Ds and S should pass|pg||
nt|haans: intermediate?|pg||
nt|copeyj: I am amazed Volcker has cue bid|pg||
nt|copeyj: he has nothing in partner's primary suit|pg||
nt|copeyj: he has a terrible holding in the splinter suit|pg||
nt|haans: spade 4-1 i say a killer |pg||
nt|copeyj: and he only has 4 trumps|pg||
nt|copeyj: North is pretty minimum, but he does have the nuts in controls|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W can;t be too comfortable doubling on that hand, but pass is too dangerous|pg||
nt|mcphee: oh my|pg||
nt|haans: hard to sea a slam now|pg||
nt|yuval10: if E bid 3NT then S will have to find the @d lead|pg||
nt|ralfwil: after the @s finess E cannot make|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@S = 6-10, no 4 card major or diamonds or 13+ no 4 card major bal|pg||
nt|petergill: they play transfer responses to 1@C|pg||
nt|ralfwil: even if he han played on @cKx|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@C natural, minimum|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: to stay at the table is a bad habit..I think no kinda rule in bridge|pg||
nt|szalay: if North says 3@D exclusion RKC could help...and later a grand slamtry:|pg||
nt|haans: normal opening bid?|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: no, 2@h is weak, but with partner who passed it can still be strongish|pg||
nt|haans: ok ok|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 22-18 obligatory pass by S|pg||
nt|mcphee: it is often bad to pass with 5 trumps|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i've not a small doubt that they know what they are doing, however alert box was empty and tried to get your help|pg||
nt|h_karluk: now, maybe @d lead by N and then N would try to find safe discards|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 4@C i prefer|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: 2@H help me now|pg||
nt|ady: west trying to scramble to a better spot|pg||
nt|szalay: North wd accept with source of tricks, for sure|pg||
nt|szalay: I dunno why to ask stopper with QJx|pg||
nt|haans: rite u r|pg||
nt|daman: maybe a low intermediate|pg||
nt|daman: 10-13|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: brave man|pg||
nt|h_karluk: you know what they say when the home road is apparent just drive there|pg||
nt|h_karluk: EW 25, NS 15 @d lead makes things more interesting|pg||
nt|xenya: impossible|pg||
nt|pierced: will be easier in OR with 2@d open|pg||
nt|yuval10: quite reasonably, he didn't find it|pg||
nt|yuval10: and now 12 tricks possible for declarer|pg||
nt|xenya: can't avoid taking the lot|pg||
mb|p|nt|VugraphPl1: sorry|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like a misunderstanding here|pg||
nt|sharkey: 4@D is crazy ....|pg||
nt|haans: wd|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think one should double when he/she's sure for -2|pg||
nt|yo_yo: maybe 5@C even  , not 3@D|pg||
nt|othered1: I don't like balanced 11's either, AK-A excepted, perhaps|pg||
nt|haans: had no bid vul|pg||
nt|petergill: North might dbl 2@C, but it would just push EW to 3@C which makes|pg||
nt|han: I don't like the double by south much|pg||
nt|han: there are some hands with 3433 with which I would double|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sharkey: West gets whathe asked for|pg||
nt|davidb: hi good evening|pg||
nt|h_karluk: just curiosity, when someone would intervene?|pg||
nt|szalay: 4@D was optional RKC|pg||
nt|vbman: jump raises must be so pushy in italy , l found 4sp so conservaitve|pg||
nt|ralfwil: that´s my opinion too:)|pg||
nt|han: but here, on an 11-count with a partner that has passed and red against white|pg||
nt|han: I don't see the upside|pg||
pc|h2|nt|szalay: std polish lead: low from doubleton|pg||
nt|ady: looks like down 1|pg||
nt|yuval10: but it will turn on the right side for NS|pg||
nt|h_karluk: bid 6 make 7 now, bid 7 go down 1 when @h K fails in a different layout|pg||
nt|daman: I have been told it is 9-13|pg||
nt|mcphee: S erred here big time IMHO|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that's better|pg||
pc|h3|nt|yuval10: 4NT probably interpreted as 1430 by S|pg||
nt|sybarra: awkwardly,  but "we" landed |pg||
nt|szalay: bad hand, 2KC and queen|pg||
nt|szalay: but he has 0:)|pg||
nt|copeyj: they are heading for slam now - they have 4/5 keys and Q trumps|pg||
nt|h_karluk: my reasoning : partner gave a free bid over art 2N and decided to 3N so i shld show my respect to his decision|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i am sure you are right but West will always bid 3NT with a nebulous stop|pg||
nt|h_karluk: well, how about 3@c please? was it a must ? :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes  a must|pg||
nt|ralfwil: to succed he must take the deep finess in @s|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 3@h, 4@s, @d A  = 8 and still a chance to shift @d|pg||
nt|h_karluk: oh after @s lead no matter|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|haans: 4m for me only as invite to 5|pg||
nt|haans: as good as 1nt ruffing @D|pg||
nt|ady: yes  nice contract    I dont agree with 3NT immediate |pg||
nt|po-s: Even 3-2 in trumps is nad enough if same hand has two diamonds|pg||
nt|h_karluk: almost slam but fails, a @s and @c A obvious losers, good stop, S not excited|pg||
nt|haans: score to NS |pg||
nt|sybarra: this is ambitious|pg||
nt|han: and it risks going for a big number, especially after 1S|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ady: should east have removed to 2@S  with 3 in each?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think many would double to show equal strength|pg||
nt|haans: you win some lose some|pg||
nt|sybarra: likely to play for the drop in @H's |pg||
nt|hawe45:  4 boards 50 minutes|pg||
nt|xenya: exciting|pg||
nt|haans: dinessing inh spades|pg||
nt|yuval10: very good X by E, sensing the misfit|pg||
nt|haans: raise @D|pg||
pc|hK|nt|xenya: but can they beat 3N?|pg||
nt|haans: if decl play spade = go up with Q|pg||
nt|yo_yo: oh yes, not easy|pg||
nt|ralfwil: or rely on a mistake in the defence|pg||
nt|h_karluk: then all roads to rome, he has something and probably picked his best, really when they can stop at 3 N, never? :)|pg||
nt|othered1: 5@D doesn't give partner much room|pg||
pc|h6|nt|szalay: some players play GF means: "forcing to 4-of-minor if 3N not possible"|pg||
nt|szalay: I predicted small slam|pg||
nt|szalay: good play is often slow play, imho|pg||
nt|haans: may still be a flat |pg||
nt|copeyj: what would you lead as west?|pg||
nt|copeyj: QX@D looks like a terrible holding|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: Thomas is hoping he has some extra's tho|pg||
nt|po-s: difficult lead|pg||
nt|haans: some say with 4 trump lead one|pg||
nt|copeyj: Volcker is, by the way, in the final of the French Open Trials - he defeated Bessis in the semi final!|pg||
nt|po-s: HJ perhaps??|pg||
nt|copeyj: and apparently Bessis is sat at the table writing out their convention card our operator tells me!|pg||
nt|copeyj: A trump has been suggested by some kibbers - but QX@D puts me off that - I would lead a @H and then it is a question of which @H to lead|pg||
nt|haans: squeeze tempo|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, east is done|pg||
nt|h_karluk: maybe just would employ a heart finesse then enjoy|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|haans: Hung may hope for 2nt from W|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hi David welcome aboard|pg||
nt|rnmalik: could S on 5@D bid 5@S?|pg||
nt|szalay: play will be fast|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Can't make it with spades 4-1 and diamonds 4-2|pg||
nt|haans: now decl to think what took so long|pg||
nt|po-s: could you with spades 3-2?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Depends who has 2|pg||
nt|sybarra: can we negotiate 10 tricks here?|pg||
nt|haans: some way im sure :)|pg||
nt|han: now they don't go for a number but it will make it easy for declarer to find the club queen|pg||
pc|d2|nt|h_karluk: i think i would definitely couldn't find that grand - when @h K wasn't at partner|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: fryklund was not sure about 4 nt answer so he bid 7 h lucky boy........|pg||
nt|h_karluk: wild but worked, congrats|pg||
nt|szalay: it wd be exclusion|pg||
nt|h_karluk: okay say N rebid 2@c (3+) really what could be S's rebid after 1N F1? :)|pg||
nt|mcphee: even if partner holds 3@D it is 100% clear to raise @D I think|pg||
nt|yo_yo: they lay out is a bit fortunate for NS |pg||
nt|yo_yo: what about a show up squeeze?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|h_karluk: shalom :)|pg||
nt|haans: 16 no good lead|pg||
nt|yuval10: E would've done better by ducking the @d|pg||
nt|henryb:  now that would not occur to me. I think X asks partner to lead MY suit|pg||
nt|haans: only one entry in spades|pg||
nt|haans: clubs are not a good entry|pg||
nt|h_karluk: now enjoy long clubs at the table|pg||
nt|xenya: 5@C makes on any lead of course -- as does 4@S -- somewhat luckily though |pg||
nt|yuval10: i think 4@h is making too if you insist :)|pg||
nt|xenya: yes|pg||
pc|dT|nt|yo_yo: 2 club losers and a H but they cant get to them|pg||
nt|po-s: The pass isn´t such a terrible decision (only pretty bad) considering his void in spades|pg||
nt|mcphee: assume N holds only 3@D, his likely shape is 5-3-3-2 making the S hand a great fit, do you not think so?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think with 0-4-5-4 and 2K+1Q after F1N not easy rebids there esp 2@c rebid (3+) comes by declarer|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|ady: try a club|pg||
nt|haans: I would have played 2@H|pg||
nt|po-s: of course, but to consider the quality of the slam|pg||
nt|marlowepi: perhaps W thought that the double by E created a force (since E did not just bid some number of hearts at first turn). otherwise 4H seems questionable, with the poor minors. a ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: double pushing us to the 3-level should be 6 LTC so W doesnt have anything extra|pg||
nt|ritong: this has the merit to get it fast|pg||
nt|h_karluk: protected himself, nicely done|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|sharkey: North is Lars Kirkegaard Nielsen - Jacco informs he insisted on being shown as K. Nielsen|pg||
nt|sharkey: looks like 500|pg||
pc|h9|nt|hawe45:  claim|pg||
pc|hT|nt|sybarra: spade switch now?|pg||
nt|sybarra: but all roads lead to -1 (or 2_ |pg||
nt|yuval10: not declarer has no problems at all|pg||
nt|yo_yo: crunch time|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hard, N has safe discards|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but in 3N, good question, worths to analyse trick by trick|pg||
nt|ralfwil: there is no squeeze tempo|pg||
nt|yo_yo: finesse @H then run the trumps|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but still depends on North having @S|pg||
nt|yo_yo: actually he can count North for  2 of the 3 queens|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it's just @S10 he's worried about|pg||
nt|han: now declarer knows that north has @dKJ, as Ralf pointed out|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's a bad one, agreed|pg||
nt|haans: 4@D just natural|pg||
pc|d4|nt|h_karluk: I think Denmark would win this set very easily|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Small @H is the only chance|pg||
pc|d6|nt|haans: :) easy make :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: clubs blocked |pg||
nt|othered1: @C leads are messing with entries to set up long @D|pg||
pc|d7|nt|szalay: small @S now|pg||
nt|ady: should cash out for -1|pg||
nt|haans: no more spade = spades 4-1|pg||
nt|han: so there is no way that he'll go wrong|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and maybe they convert IMPs to 20 VP scale, eh ?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and now is @cQ localized|pg||
nt|han: looks like he won't even need it|pg||
nt|han: if he leads the diamond queen from the dummy, north will probably cover|pg||
nt|han: and the @d8 becomes high|pg||
pc|d5|nt|daman: no more for NS|pg||
nt|marlowepi: especially since bad breaks can be expected. |pg||
nt|yo_yo: well is 5@D such a good contract?  the specs dont think so|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that's why i guess S passed confidently|pg||
nt|othered1: But they bid ti like they had it and avoided the axe.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but can he imagine that s doubled on 4333?|pg||
nt|han: ok this is an interesting play by north|pg||
nt|han: declarer has to be very confident to pitch on this|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|haans: and 3 Q|pg||
nt|marlowepi: right|pg||
nt|haans: but 3@H may be forcing|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: West went for a toilet break|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but in my view W was right to think that the E auction created a force. I think it was E who overrated the value of his hand, with so much spade wastage, no shortness, and spades ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: due to be overruffed by N|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: they had a misunderstanding about 3@H forcing or not|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: East thought not, West thought it was|pg||
nt|haans: then we all agree|pg||
nt|mcphee: that is not the S hands decision to make though Kath|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@C Pass 1NT would be 11-12 no 4 card major balanced - this is one of the advantages of the transfer responses - you don't have to get to 2NT with 11 opposite 11 |pg||
pc|d9|nt|po-s: Tim, which bid was worst?|pg||
nt|han: can south have a doubleton diamond? seems impossible|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@H sh 4-4 or 4-5 - with 5-4 West could bid 2@S - still weak|pg||
nt|haans: axe seldom present today|pg||
nt|han: and AK? no|pg||
mc|10|nt|han: well done|pg||
nt|han: but I bet he would have found @cQ as well|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes WD:)|pg||
nt|han: the bidding made it too easy|pg||

nt|mcphee: loks like a small accident to play 4@H|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|copeyj: Italians very lucky noone could stick a red one on it - although they run to 5@C then but its still unpleasant|pg||
mb|3C|nt|mcphee: now this is a nice move|pg||
nt|copeyj: what do you bid now?|pg||
nt|mcphee: poor S|pg||
nt|copeyj: with the S hand?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Double|pg||
nt|copeyj: horrible choice|pg||
nt|xenya: 5@C is 1 down|pg||
nt|mcphee: think we need to dble|pg||
nt|copeyj: yes - but that is not without danger|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|copeyj: of ending wrong strain|pg||
nt|mcphee: although there are some other choices:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://nbbuitslagen.transfer-solutions.com/uss/goPage30.do?rndid=74915&verid=805&start=22  for standings after 22 rounds|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Could perhaps get a funny flat board in 5@D|pg||
nt|mcphee: yes Roland:)|pg||
nt|copeyj: wld need to guess @S for that|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mcphee: whow passes 4@D|pg||
nt|mcphee: no jr that is for sure:)|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mcphee: Jx @H on|pg||
pc|d3|pc|cJ|pc|c4|pg||
nt|mcphee: but the @S suit is the key|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Odds against guessing I think|pg||
nt|ritong: depends if @c K is honest|pg||
nt|mcphee: hard to give up a @H first to see who owns that ace|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe he can find out who has @HA first. A little risky though|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h2|pc|hQ|pc|h9|pg||
nt|copeyj: now knows West had A@H|pg||
nt|mcphee: wow, risk is unknown to these boys!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now he should play East for @SA|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Walddk2: East passed initially|pg||
pc|s7|nt|Walddk2: West I mean|pg||
nt|Walddk2: She can't have three aces|pg||
nt|mcphee: is @CA known ?|pg||
nt|copeyj: not really|pg||
nt|copeyj: but|pg||
nt|Walddk2: why not?|pg||
nt|ritong: depends if @c K is honest|pg||
nt|mcphee: depndings on leads |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Do they lead the king from AK and KQ?|pg||
nt|copeyj: someone else has just pointed out - east could have risen A@S and taken @H ruff|pg||
nt|copeyj: but doesnt know about loc of @HA i spose|pg||
nt|xenya: E could defeat it at this point bu winning the @SA and returning the @HJ|pg||
nt|mcphee: i doubt they do Roland but E missed her chance|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pc|hJ|pc|hT|pg||
nt|mcphee: so a 10 or 11 imp loss here if they grab the @H ruff|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|pc|d6|pc|hK|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|s3|pc|s9|pg||
pc|sT|nt|mcphee: seems this was a crucial match for Italy, will this push them out of the SF Roland should they lose big?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: May happen, yes|pg||
mc|9|nt|ritong: di franco is thinking somethuing ugly in italian|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But it would still be unlucky|pg||
nt|copeyj: they could not qualify - if france II and Australia get big wins, and italy lose heavily|pg||

nt|haans: trash did win|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 21-19|pg||
nt|szalay: 4@H is ok, really interesting what N-S will do over 4@S save|pg||
nt|rnmalik: what hands we are getting, I think dealer not very comfortable:)|pg||
nt|szalay: 4@S is 500|pg||
nt|szalay: 4@Sx|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: Bob, nice lad|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: lead*|pg||
nt|mcphee: no, that does not sound like a good idea to me hamdi|pg||
nt|h_karluk: then 2@d limit ? :)|pg||
nt|mcphee: that means that 3@D must be F|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it wasnt easy|pg||
nt|yo_yo: easy for us :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: the only must at bridge tables is "more counting" - i think i love the math science much :)|pg||
nt|vbman: if pard had king 4th sp then slam wd have a chance|pg||
nt|h_karluk: half of the match over|pg||
nt|sybarra: so wd,  on the "any 11" |pg||
nt|haans: nothing has happened yet|pg||
nt|sybarra: wonder if they are fighting again |pg||
nt|haans: yed ED soon long talk about that|pg||
nt|othered1: both of them took pushy actions|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: nope... NS were discussing if this auction was Forcing over 5@D|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 20-20 there|pg||
nt|petergill: Well played|pg||
mb|1H|nt|hawe45:  Best game here 3 NT, but difficult to reach|pg||
nt|pelu: 11 tricks in 4@H - coffee time :)|pg||
nt|haans: 3nt (no clubs lead)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, not all. E thought NF|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 28-12 now|pg||
nt|othered1: that wasn't "any" as it did have 2 + honor tricks|pg||
nt|haans: long overdue|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: time to bid 3@H|pg||
nt|szalay: probably 4@S silences everyone|pg||
nt|h_karluk: in other words game time|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: what about the lucky 6@c? ;)|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|szalay: leave table..and slower play...|pg||
nt|xenya: much better to play @Ds up twice from W|pg||
nt|h_karluk: cold 4@s|pg||
nt|haans: bid better than x|pg||
nt|haans: easy slam here|pg||
nt|pelu: play to one goal - but Australia No 4 and NL-21 No 22 in the standing, so natural|pg||
nt|h_karluk: my guess EW would buy to 2/3 @s|pg||
nt|szalay: may be 3@S yet|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like 4@s for me with N's cards|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|mcphee: so if it is invite ahnd how can it be included in the F group?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: close hands|pg||
nt|h_karluk: in other words borderline|pg||
nt|haans: east bidding 1@H?|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, he p rotected himself from the twelfth trick|pg||
nt|haans: his best choice|pg||
nt|h_karluk: defenders would only cash their 4 @s tricks, yes very lucky @c slam while @d hook onside|pg||
nt|yuval10: awkward bid for N now|pg||
nt|xenya: on 2, the French tool one step further to 3@C -- 1 down and 4 imps to Israel|pg||
nt|xenya: *took|pg||
nt|h_karluk: while 4 @h not much hard maybe 4@s x-2 nice try|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@D 4+ hearts|pg||
mb|2H!|an|!s + !d|nt|szalay: impossible to play with that speed|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hmm, 4 cards M|pg||
nt|szalay: but a lot better if they dont lead @D|pg||
nt|haans: 18-19 balanced hand (italian style)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: most use the 4NT opener as asking for aces|pg||
nt|yo_yo: obviously here it's for minors|pg||
nt|h_karluk: unusual - like overcall|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Grosset has to bid @S surely|pg||
nt|ralfwil: my only bid as E is pass|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i hate those three Js though|pg||
nt|yo_yo: presumably West has shown   a monster hand with the majors|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i won't double as East, i ve a junk|pg||
nt|ralfwil: if W can bid again (nothing else than D) i can bid my @s|pg||
nt|othered1: why should it be forcing when they passed out at 3@S?|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: 3@s super accept i expect by E|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Cold with 4 losers...|pg||
nt|haans: stronger than 3@C|pg||
nt|ady: grand      not wasy to locate |pg||
nt|pelu: close to a 2@C-opening - 2½ loser|pg||
nt|ady: yes   should be routine|pg||
nt|sybarra: ugh,  I would probably also open 2nt but looking at all 4 hands this will not be a success|pg||
nt|daman: if South had led the @H K    he could have switched to a @D after seeing dummy     the @H K is a standard lead in that situation      no guarantee to beat 4@S though since @Ds are ...|pg||
nt|daman: ...|pg||
nt|mcphee: 2@S 2N?|pg||
nt|mcphee: or 2@S 3@S?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: one of those :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: here ? i agree with 1N for sure|pg||
nt|ritong: no big deal, though|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i am ok to handle such hands with uncontested 1N (15-17) then 3@h (mild slam invite for @c suit)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: say opener refuse then stops at 3N, otherwise pulls|pg||
nt|vbman: so this opens a way|pg||
nt|sybarra: some sort of preemptive raise coming (and did) |pg||
nt|haans: suggestion after 3@S giving oppd 4 level but  axe at 5|pg||
nt|othered1: another not very light overcall.|pg||
nt|yuval10: 3@s is a good bid by E to jam the bidding|pg||
nt|han: it would be nice to know whether 2@h shows spades and a specific minor or either minor|pg||
nt|han: let's assume either minor|pg||
nt|han: thanks Tim|pg||
nt|han: 3@c by north now?|pg||
nt|han: Pass/Correct?|pg||
nt|han: some bid 2NT to ask for the minor but I think that's better played as showing game interest|pg||
nt|han: oh no|pg||
nt|han: still thinking it shows either minor|pg||
nt|han: then what is north thinking about? isn't this a clear 3@d bid?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: alerted as @s and @d|pg||
nt|han: white against red, south doesn't need anything near this|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: no he bid 3@d but can only click when the tray is under|pg||
mb|3D|nt|haans: preemts|pg||
nt|yo_yo: what's the advantage of transfer responses?|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
nt|han: err|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: spades and diamonds|pg||
nt|han: aha|pg||
mb|4C|nt|sybarra: S can "see" no hts in N |pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: 6@C looks cold to me here|pg||
nt|haans: slam here|pg||
nt|mcphee: some feel pass and 2N is a choice|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and 2@s rebid also, 3@s adventure <my review, my opinion>|pg||
nt|mcphee: S could try 2@C and hope to survie that|pg||
nt|po-s: the only way to convince anyonae that 2D-pass isn´t terrible would be to move the HA to West|pg||
nt|yo_yo: what a view!   |pg||
nt|h_karluk: my worst fears confirmed, E doubled, fortunately W passed|pg||
nt|yuval10: otherwise very easy for S to bid 3@h and for N to raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: but do you X|pg||
nt|sybarra: not so sure bidding 5 @D in tempo might not get them to 5 @H  but we will never know |pg||
nt|rnmalik: 2@S and @CJ and cross ruff possible|pg||
nt|h_karluk: now makes 3NT|pg||
nt|szalay: I dont use "congrats" in this case:) lucky is more normal:)|pg||
nt|sharkey: 3 NT on a @D lead|pg||
nt|haans: good q to all what did double mean? lead dummy or own suit|pg||
nt|sybarra: may flop into 3 nt but see judith using slow approach |pg||
nt|copeyj: Nab choosin just to invite with 4333 9 count|pg||
nt|po-s: I think 4C is a slight overbid. South has good trumps and a working HK plus ruffing value in diamonds, must definitely bid 4H, but then....|pg||
nt|copeyj: but Drijver tries 3N anyway on strength of his @C suit despite the minimum hcp|pg||
nt|haans: nothing wrong with 6n|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: true, :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo:  tres bien Grosset|pg||
nt|han: I imagine south will do some more|pg||
mb|4H|nt|sharkey: West held off after last hand... - not unexpected|pg||
nt|h_karluk: weird, W declined the invitation|pg||
nt|sharkey: 4@S set with @D shift|pg||
nt|haans: missin game not junior style :) sort of|pg||
nt|haans: you needed some thing like Blue clubs to find slam|pg||
nt|yuval10: once again NS will make their contract, probably with an overtrick|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: this should be 1 away without too much trouble|pg||
nt|haans: 15 with a lose Q|pg||
nt|Walddk4: They both had borderline hands. I don't think 4@C is a serious overbid with all those controls|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 7 controls, AKxxx suit|pg||
nt|copeyj: Volcker must switch to @H when he is in with the @CK |pg||
nt|h_karluk: but his homework was 3N, right?|pg||
nt|tomi2: parter might play him for havin 5 cards and raise 3 3@H in their methods with 4 card support|pg||
nt|ritong: any trick counts with a VP scale|pg||
nt|othered1: wouidln't it be nice if west could have shown @H shortness on this particular hand?|pg||
nt|petergill: 11H 11-15 with 3 hearts or 11-13 (bad) with 4 hearts|pg||
nt|han: I guess not|pg||
nt|han: 4@h?|pg||
nt|han: that I find hard to understand|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: What wd u lead from T962?|pg||
nt|sybarra: 10 |pg||
nt|szalay: I think either 6 or 2 (depends on your methods)|pg||
nt|szalay: T is not a honour:)|pg||
nt|szalay: u can waste interior cards that way...watch it now...|pg||
nt|xenya: on 1, the Poles in the other room wound up in 4@H -- strange contract. 11 imps to Israel|pg||
nt|szalay: with appropriate entries declaler could have 4 tricks now|pg||
nt|szalay: it looks another good board for Dutch 2suiter methods|pg||
nt|ritong: some more than others , admittedly|pg||
nt|h_karluk: West for sure confident that his partner has cover cards, however in which suits, for now unsure|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@H|pg||
nt|haans: depend on what 1nt rebid show 18-19 or not 3 @H|pg||
nt|petergill: 1NT denies 4 spades as 1@S over 1@H would be 4 spades, non forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: cant take 10 tricks, imho|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @s Qj drops, wow|pg||
nt|haans: naturally or bid it :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: meanwhile that's a mirror hand|pg||
nt|daman: 3-3   and West can pitch a @C|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our next match, in about 45 minutes, will be France 2 vs Netherlands Red (leaders)|pg||
nt|vbman: when cards are open who wants to play this in 6cl?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: easy contract, declarer may claim very soon|pg||
nt|vbman: in 5cl its different|pg||
nt|h_karluk: unless i see @d AQjx at my hand i cannot dream|pg||
nt|vbman: must be careful to avoid to dia loser|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 6 losers hand with East, surely worths to go 3 level alone|pg||
nt|ralfwil: with only one entry on W the @h finess (for @hJ) is necessary|pg||
nt|petergill: The extra bidding space for the transfers allows you to stop in 1@H or 1@S sometimes|pg||
nt|petergill: from the transfers I mean|pg||
nt|ralfwil: easy to lead @s now|pg||
nt|han: clearly something has gone wrong for EW, but what?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: a scramble but can find 9 tricks |pg||
nt|copeyj: I dont think so Shirley|pg||
nt|mcphee: 3@S a tad pushy with this suit I think|pg||
nt|po-s: no Barry, one is enough, don´t overdo things|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i only see 3 Aces and a tenace, no quick tricks, just 6223|pg||
nt|othered1: gives you an extra bid and determines level of support quickly, they say.  |pg||
nt|othered1: And may let  you right side NT contracts into opener's,presumably stronger, hand.|pg||
nt|haans: at no cost |pg||
nt|yuval10: 4@s can go down 3 in a perfect D|pg||
nt|yuval10: but not after lead @d|pg||
nt|han: one needs a lot of imagination to think that 1NT followed by 4C shows heart support|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: Montanari excuses himnself|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: for his bidding|pg||
pc|s9|nt|h_karluk: i was polite - meant 'congrats - with murder in my heart' :)|pg||
nt|chick: I think the usual meaning of the double is lead my suit, but if both have bid a suit, it's lead the non-normal one|pg||
nt|haans: very hard to avoid|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it's a bit pushy but 2@S  doesnt seem enough|pg||
nt|po-s: Is South trying to compenate for his earlier pass?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think there's not extras|pg||
nt|po-s: compensate|pg||
nt|mcphee: y Kath it doesn't, but for me a major overbid|pg||
nt|yo_yo: there's something to that, especially when we hear North was upset|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and 1NT is closed box, maybe good or bad, who knows, say good still pulls, say bad, nice stop|pg||
nt|mcphee: well if 1N is bad, 3@S is likely going to fail|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that's why i advocated 2@s nice stop|pg||
nt|po-s: H7 lead may prove costly|pg||
nt|yo_yo: specs are advocating a 2@C rebid by south  but i find that strange with a 6 card major|pg||
nt|mcphee: well if you survive 2@C it is not so bad|pg||
nt|h_karluk: count me in, no extras, no adventure|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes look at the @H spots|pg||
nt|po-s: why would 3S go down?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: in worst scenario during auction PO|pg||
nt|mcphee: facing a bad hand it might not even make 2 PO|pg||
nt|h_karluk: yes, that's another possibility BOB, so minimum damage not bad, eh :)|pg||
nt|othered1: That I'm not too sure of.  There's always a cost.|pg||
pc|s7|nt|hawe45:  @D better than @C ib South|pg||
nt|hawe45:  in|pg||
nt|haans: must play one more @H psychic|pg||
nt|szalay: -200 is a bargain here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and it came too - the @s lead|pg||
pc|sK|nt|szalay: but South thought more undertricks, I believe|pg||
nt|ady: acw  king ace and those trumps  seems double right|pg||
nt|szalay: but he must switch to trump|pg||
nt|szalay: North count helped a lot|pg||
nt|ady: yes agree|pg||
nt|sybarra: pickling his own suit however |pg||
nt|h_karluk: to @c lead|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No Lavinthal this @C 8...!|pg||
nt|chick: not me, I would open 1@D and rebid 2N ... I think HCP is an excellent indication of NT values, and I stretch of the standard HCP only with a strong source of extra tricks|pg||
nt|haans: you did last time we played 3ntxx|pg||
nt|haans: 3@C puppet i presume|pg||
nt|copeyj: now Bessis must switch to @H|pg||
nt|haans: hearts now down|pg||
nt|po-s: I said "slight" overbid, and if they have no other strong support bid then ....|pg||
nt|h_karluk: double for doen one, phew|pg||
nt|haans: change that to 'low cost'|pg||
nt|sybarra: this will "flop" nicely (as Henri would say) |pg||
pc|s4|nt|yuval10: 3NT would've been easier here|pg||
nt|szalay: when longer trump could be tapped, moysian (4-3) fit isnt so good|pg||
nt|yuval10: but it looks like declarer can still manage|pg||
nt|sharkey: sry - E doesn't have any useful pitch on @H10|pg||
nt|hawe45:  6 I mean|pg||
nt|han: ok let's accept that Tim|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|szalay: why not 3N over 2?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: for our kibitzers let me try to explain : same shape at EW|pg||
nt|rnmalik: on @C switch|pg||
nt|szalay: I have heard same contract in OR|pg||
nt|szalay: I have a spy:)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Your interest well appreciated your match:)|pg||
nt|szalay: bidding was: 2@H-X-4@H-4@S|pg||
nt|szalay: dunno why not doubled by North|pg||
nt|szalay: I am Hungarian, my Godmother was Dutch...what I need more?:)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: yes on that bidding X possible|pg||
nt|haans: my suit 2 down|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: yes|pg||
nt|daman: this was a neat auction|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: montanari very relieved franchi has @h's|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: but he's the kind of guy to joke around|pg||
nt|haans: had bid 3@C myself (showing 4 spades)|pg||
nt|othered1: Right.  Among them, opponents can use the actual suit bid for whatever they'd like, including natural or to distinguish defensively-proemted hands.|pg||
nt|yo_yo: the spade pips make this an easy hand|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sybarra: tap dummy is ok |pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think  3@c was NF there|pg||
nt|rnmalik: mixed feelings:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: hmm, decl threw @cq trick one|pg||
nt|haans: ok|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: couldn't see, he's a big man|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think coaches never allow psyches in junior level|pg||
nt|haans: well done|pg||
nt|xenya: E's double is beyond my understanding|pg||
nt|daman: Turley picked up 5 IMPs on Board 2|pg||
nt|haans: high to me is ruff high|pg||
nt|copeyj: ouch|pg||
nt|mcphee: wow|pg||
nt|mcphee: will he get this right?|pg||
nt|po-s: I think with defenced like these there is little risk in jumping away|pg||
nt|ralfwil: who says that W has 2 defensive tricks? none on E|pg||
nt|yo_yo: or tres bien Verbeek |pg||
nt|h_karluk: for records *down - srry for typo guys|pg||
pc|d9|nt|szalay: from T9xy I wd lead T/9 only if X=8|pg||
nt|xenya: this doesn't look rosy for declarer|pg||
nt|szalay: otherwise x or y|pg||
nt|daman: Turkey*|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: that's a reasonable play... I was actually typing out something to that respect|pg||
nt|haans: use  spectable|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: but realized declarer was missing the JT@H|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: which makes it a lot less attractive|pg||
nt|yo_yo: both sides did well|pg||
pc|d2|nt|rnmalik: -1|pg||
nt|haans: (2@D-3@C)|pg||
nt|daman: they bid up to 4@C and then sold out to 4@H and beat it|pg||
nt|chick: or Turkiye :)|pg||
nt|daman: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: misguessed the hearts|pg||
nt|tomi2: now thei found out about their 11 card club fit :)|pg||
nt|vbman: now two dia|pg||
nt|haans: telling opps how to defend game?|pg||
nt|yuval10: yes, 3 rounds of @c, South discard his lone @d|pg||
pc|d6|nt|szalay: not, xruff is coming|pg||
nt|ady: I think will make 8 trump tricks and 2 spades   needed to play a trump|pg||
nt|szalay: what was South's plan?|pg||
nt|haans: or Sweden or ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: would employ a hook, 3-3 friendly distribution|pg||
nt|h_karluk: pitches stiff @d and gets a ruff etc|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|othered1: defensively-oriented|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx to pards a87x, and k9 in south, etc |pg||
nt|yuval10: then ruff !f, AK@h|pg||
pc|s5|nt|yuval10: he was affraid of stoppers in the red suit |pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: I could repeat the comment i made last board|pg||
pc|s6|nt|szalay: ouch...|pg||
nt|sybarra: oops|pg||
nt|szalay: he was optimistic last time, became pessimistic now?:)|pg||
nt|davidb: agressive  juniors bidding . W  has an easy pass over 3H |pg||
nt|daman: this was not a painful switch|pg||
nt|haans: or Romex|pg||
nt|daman: gave up the suit|pg||
nt|petergill: Maybe he can pitch @CQ on the 4th @D to create an extra entry in @CJ? Maybe not?|pg||
nt|petergill: "not" is more like it|pg||
pc|h5|pc|sA|pg||
nt|szalay: it wont make, I think...especially when declarer ate his @D entry|pg||
nt|haans: do they listen to coaches|pg||
nt|haans: spade finesse|pg||
nt|han: a pleasant score for NS|pg||
nt|han: perhaps now club ruff, spade ruff with the queen, another heart trick coming for -300?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|yuval10: suits even|pg||
nt|szalay: its not 7HCP's duty|pg||
nt|yuval10: *@d|pg||
pc|c3|nt|h_karluk: or drop|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, the @S 10 could be promoted|pg||
pc|h7|pc|cA|pg||
nt|ady: what was west's plan|pg||
nt|haans: 2 defensive trick :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: might mean it as sort of a responsive....|pg||
nt|daman: a pedestrian @C continuation seems best|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sharkey: so off 1|pg||
nt|yo_yo: squeeze time|pg||
pc|d5|nt|sybarra: Koike, did not realize his blessing |pg||
nt|haans: why did North not play the @SJ|pg||
nt|h_karluk: contract impossible to make|pg||
nt|h_karluk: thanks not cashed @c A|pg||
nt|haans: not more then little unluck|pg||
nt|yuval10: no promotion actually...just 6 tricks - 3@c, @d ruff and AK@H|pg||
pc|d4|nt|h_karluk: set stone orders :)|pg||
nt|haans: and so a make|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|szalay: neither of them realized that someone leads a trump, declarer's 2 trump at most 1 trick|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @d switch wld better|pg||
nt|vbman: loose to doubleton q and u r down|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ady: now losing spade trick|pg||
nt|h_karluk: however, we see it on DD, hard to visualize at th table , most players wld pick stiff lead|pg||
pc|hT|nt|szalay: easy 2 off, next one, pls|pg||
nt|frankaus: my view is that texas is an anacronistic agreement - now superceeded|pg||
nt|h_karluk: weird but seems so, just changed his mind quickly, that's what i see|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|xenya: well defended for 2 down|pg||
nt|ady: no sorry   club winner   has to ruff|pg||
nt|szalay: no|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I agree with Simon that 4@H was an overbid. Wasted @CK, xx in diamonds and only four trumps|pg||
nt|h_karluk: to 5?|pg||
nt|vbman: yes|pg||
nt|xenya: true Yuval|pg||
nt|h_karluk: on the other hand 3@c there|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so there might be a reason to lead from J9|pg||
nt|yuval10: good score by EW anyway, it seem|pg||
nt|pierced: i dunno|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|szalay: partner has  half of teh deck|pg||
nt|rnmalik: back to -2 and flat|pg||
pc|d3|nt|szalay: instead of @C @D is a good lead here|pg||
nt|daman: it will cost them an IMP eventually would be my guess|pg||
pc|d8|nt|mcphee: used to be Kath:)|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ady: down 1|pg||
nt|rnmalik: that play of @H was fatal to the contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: Koike looks like he knows what chance he missed|pg||
nt|szalay: and Molenaar?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: how abt say OR lands 4@h|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|cK|pc|hK|nt|h_karluk: push next please|pg||
nt|mcphee: oh it is still there|pg||
nt|xenya: might not be so good now|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 620 vs 500 then|pg||
nt|haans: so as to to be endplayed|pg||
pc|hA|nt|pierced: think its -2 |pg||
nt|ralfwil: does not matter to discard @cQ|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|han: Van Leeuwen played the lowest club twice so no spade back, but this is just as good|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h6|nt|VugraphPl1: 78%|pg||
pc|c6|nt|sybarra: ugh|pg||
nt|rnmalik: bad luck|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: he looks like he always does|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|c9|pc|s8|nt|h_karluk: east positionally squeezed|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|szalay: N-S made 2N|pg||

mc|6|nt|ralfwil: -4(!)|pg||

nt|ritong: hi guys|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|an|12-14|mb|p|nt|mcphee: on the @S lead it is best we do not get @D wrong|pg||
nt|copeyj: 5@D much better here - but very hard to reach|pg||
nt|ritong: when east holds @s KQ, yes|pg||
nt|mcphee: not sure if that is so actually|pg||
nt|ritong: anyways west should inquire about that|pg||
nt|copeyj: if W transfers to @D|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|copeyj: then shows @S shortage|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3NT makes even on a spade lead. You can keep North out|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: i'd imagine E would bid 3N|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|ritong: describing long @ds and @s shortness should be possible|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|ritong: if it is not yet, homework to be done|pg||

nt|rnmalik: or bad assessment:)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: rebid showed 18-19, so if there is a nearest game why not 3N by S|pg||
nt|szalay: touch and go 4@H|pg||
nt|szalay: it will makes if trump by opps: no option just staright @C hook|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 20-20 1st time there|pg||
nt|pelu: strong 2@C and positiv response - if East can show 4 controls - easy way to 6|pg||
nt|haans: not me but 1NT = 4 controls|pg||
nt|ady: 4 hearts fails with K@D wrong|pg||
nt|chick: There IS a guideline that says when the auction goes 2N P P, 4th seat should double on principle, because the dummy has no entries for finessing and declarer will have to play out ...|pg||
nt|chick: of his own hand |pg||
nt|chick: sometimes it works :)|pg||
nt|szalay: funny when it was passed out North could think: "ouch, may I double yet?"|pg||
nt|sybarra: true chick |pg||
nt|szalay: if pd has Q of @D: 3 off|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: de Pagter tried to trick Lazar on the last brd with discarding @d|pg||
nt|daman: partscore again|pg||
nt|daman: where are the slam hands?|pg||
nt|copeyj: pretty likely game swing to the Netherlands, that one|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 4@C usually contains a strong diamond suit, so I would be much happier with @DQ than @HK|pg||
nt|haans: defense losers more points than decl makes|pg||
nt|haans: was it a weak nt?|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: yes|pg||
nt|haans: ok|pg||
nt|haans: yep we all been there|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Adam will feel better now|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 21-19 this time|pg||
nt|h_karluk: this 4N is also in my CC - with my best p|pg||
nt|othered1: or telling partner should they buy it |pg||
nt|haans: yep both count :(|pg||
nt|yuval10: it is|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so just 3 IMPs, anyways in 10 boards match not bad|pg||
nt|ralfwil: only 6@s on board 2 in OR|pg||
nt|han: better :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: 24-16 again partscore|pg||
nt|po-s: ATxx.AJx,AKQxx,x  is opener´s hand. If he gets 4S, should he bid again??|pg||
mb|1C|nt|szalay: 5431 is a good treatment|pg||
nt|szalay: Poles invented 5431-convention|pg||
nt|hawe45:  East will welcome a @S-opening + do.-support|pg||
nt|haans: not 2 aces K = 1 contraol Ace 2|pg||
nt|haans: all may be in @D'|pg||
nt|sybarra: but at imps,  maybe not always prudent |pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: I always find the making lead when my partner doubles on principle :(|pg||
nt|xenya: yes perhaps it means: pd, we have more points than they -- but so what?|pg||
nt|daman: what would we bid with the South hand?  1NT?|pg||
nt|chick: giving juniors too many slam hands can result in bids at the 8 level :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that's a good one Hamdi|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 22-18 and from this empty hat ? :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: I cant ever remember asking for aces with my first bid|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 28 vs 12, game time|pg||
nt|tomi2: can understand his desire to make this sprectacular move, would have done the same :)|pg||
nt|ritong: :)|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: 1@D is 5@D or 4441|pg||
nt|haans: Australia missed 7nt|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3nt on EW?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|szalay: jump to 3M means: stiff major, 3card other major|pg||
nt|szalay: the weak nt|pg||
nt|szalay: East hand is interesting|pg||
nt|szalay: I wd rather dbl first and bid @S thereafter|pg||
nt|othered1: and 2@S is? |pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: weak|pg||
nt|haans: 3rd hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: yesterday they did it on QJ107th with 2kings (7222 tho)|pg||
nt|haans: 3rd hand = anything goes|pg||
nt|sybarra: N rather doubtful it is spades |pg||
nt|petergill: France 2 were 5th, 10 VP behind Australia (2nd) at the start of this match. |pg||
mb|2D|nt|szalay: (no entry back after ruffing finesse)|pg||
nt|szalay: easy 4@H/3N by E-W|pg||
nt|haans: best is 5@C/D|pg||
nt|yuval10: the favourable lie of the cards here mean that NS can make 12 tricks in both minors|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 3@s should end the auction, and poor W is almost endplayed already|pg||
nt|copeyj: Drijver will be pleased to see N bid 3@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: South alerted, almost bid 4@h, and then realised something|pg||
nt|mcphee: might beat this|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i wonder how EW in OR didn't pick 2@s with their 4/4 fit|pg||
nt|sybarra: other room tried 4 @S as we see it didnt work |pg||
nt|sybarra: and lost chance here|pg||
nt|haans: good jump there|pg||
nt|othered1: that's major suit Wonder?|pg||
nt|haans: supried is is allowed|pg||
nt|petergill: By now France 2 is probably ahead of Australia in the overall standings. There is one more match after this one, before the semi finals|pg||
mb|2S|nt|szalay: especially usefull if u open 1N with 5card M|pg||
nt|sybarra: and will be happy to defend even undoubled |pg||
nt|h_karluk: oh because of 12-14 weak NT|pg||
mb|2N|nt|frankaus: true but transfer then bid game what do u loose?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think 1N then 2@s good, so you can play direct 2@s raise 8-10|pg||
nt|haans: x with void can be costly|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 2@c rebid then 2@s rebid, so all pass would also be nice|pg||
nt|szalay: In my book REOPENING 2@H shows kinda hand, what West has|pg||
nt|hawe45:  3 NT is the best spot|pg||
nt|szalay: so NO W2 in balancing seat|pg||
nt|daman: the double is probably t/o for the majors?    it was alerted|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: yes|pg||
nt|daman: S should pull|pg||
nt|haans: agressive|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: I guess I spoke too soon, maybe I should be disqualified as a junior|pg||
nt|h_karluk: same story here|pg||
nt|mcphee: @H lead possible and that gives it away, hi @D also possible to take a look see and it hits gold|pg||
nt|othered1: I guess that may work if you play LMPA -- leave my preempts alone.  |pg||
nt|haans: trf after overcall coming|pg||
nt|haans: has advantages|pg||
nt|haans: mostly let overcaller lead|pg||
nt|othered1: How do you follow up as east?  Is 3@H forcing?|pg||
nt|yuval10: interesting part score battle here|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: routin 3N is coming|pg||
nt|szalay: so here 1N-3@H-4@S|pg||
nt|ady: can make 6@S as they lay|pg||
nt|pelu: back - with cofee :)|pg||
nt|szalay: but its close decision, anyway|pg||
nt|szalay: I wd bid my suit if its NOT the highest ranking one|pg||
nt|daman: uh oh|pg||
nt|yo_yo: you wont like Verbeek's bid either I guess Hamdi|pg||
nt|yo_yo: :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think nowadays there's a huge misunderstanding abt preempts|pg||
nt|haans: if @H please pass|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think brown sticker conventions permitted,  (or anything goes so to say) |pg||
nt|haans: what does the americans say about that (YOU?)|pg||
nt|sybarra: I say let them play whatever...but acbl feels differently except in big events  |pg||
nt|othered1: mimght not beat 4@H if west leads partner's "suit"|pg||
nt|sybarra: we are restricted for example in most club games from playing multi/tartan/muiderberg etc |pg||
mb|3N|nt|szalay: if no trump lead/switch: he will ruff a @D|pg||
nt|frankaus: now is X pen?|pg||
nt|szalay: "who has the @Ss, has the power"|pg||
nt|szalay: as Lenin said 93 years ago|pg||
nt|szalay: (sadly he used "sowiets" instead of @s..he could play bridge|pg||
nt|szalay: could not|pg||
nt|szalay: btw did u know our games hero, Culbertson left Russia after Revoultion?|pg||
nt|szalay: his father was a civil engineer there|pg||
nt|haans: xenya we have all been there|pg||
nt|haans: 1@C mbs did cost this time|pg||
nt|xenya: well at least W avoided being endplayed|pg||
nt|haans: North have a lot of card for his 3@S|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If I open with 4nt on that type of hand my partner has the same equipment in majors, so I must have better suits|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: so 2 @S transfer to minor? |pg||
nt|szalay: but they wont bid with missing ace and trump queen|pg||
nt|pelu: over 4@C and no @D-cue West would know|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 4@H is a very poor game. It requires more than the diamond finesse|pg||
nt|haans: poerknight: yea but if u hear 4 controls and see 3 kings in ur hand it can only be 2 aces and riye he is|pg||
nt|pelu: so NL on the scoreboard|pg||
nt|haans: @HJ may cost|pg||
nt|yo_yo: whenever I dont lead from my AKx  partner always has 5|pg||
nt|mcphee: :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so @d K lead could save the day for NS|pg||
nt|yo_yo: whenever I do, it's declarer's suit|pg||
nt|othered1: I'm not sure why you want the preemptor on lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: and makes no sense, to me,   |pg||
nt|haans: Multi is a good 40 year invention|pg||
nt|sybarra: played in Europe and even the grandmothers had defenses agst multi/ tartan etc |pg||
nt|yuval10: the 1@h by S may prevent EW to find their @h fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: i think passive trump lead auto there|pg||
nt|szalay: best defence is: cash 3 winners and @C|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - West should know pd's loaded; however, with 4 HCP too weak|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and maybe @h3 would give a better idea - say 3/5 leads thoroughout in sys card|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i did not get that 2@h|pg||
nt|chick: in balance seat, 2@H should show good 6 hearts and opening hand|pg||
nt|daman: I think the opps get their 7 before he gets his 7|pg||
nt|yo_yo: how,  how not to block the @D suit|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ok, maybe the question 3@c shows extras or not, i saw some players tend to rebid 2N to show minimum, tho there weren't @h values|pg||
nt|haans: ed do you have the answer :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: well judged by Whibley|pg||
nt|haans: but overcaller|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 22-18 i am not surprised|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: in my book that is a slamtry in M, balanced|pg||
nt|szalay: to lose balanced slamtry with 6bagger is gap, anyway|pg||
nt|yuval10: now declarer can play A and Q@c discarding @s|pg||
nt|szalay: no ruffing finesse is suggested|pg||
nt|szalay: no 100% line, and could be lead from doubleton, but that is the best line, imho|pg||
nt|h_karluk: because you have 2 aces and 3 times trumps, whenever you are in can easily work to cut a ruff|pg||
nt|haans: many do not pen until opps reach game|pg||
nt|h_karluk: while found 5/2 @s fit why he got risk , hard question to reply|pg||
nt|davidb: easy  X  by N  -Ns  at least 6 trumps & more points|pg||
nt|haans: pass on 1nt = balanced hand|pg||
nt|h_karluk: F1N not in sys?|pg||
nt|szalay: back...its the most boring set so far|pg||
nt|yo_yo: have you ever used it to ask for specific aces Ralf?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: no!|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it's on my card but never been used|pg||
pc|s2|nt|xenya: Poland got the 11 imps back quickly, when they stopped in game on 2 (6@H was the contract here) |pg||
nt|ady: north minimum  lacking aces   and wasted K@H  definately should settle for game|pg||
nt|yo_yo: waste of time :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: but is only my opinion not that of ACBL|pg||
nt|yuval10: if it was a 2@d by S right away then W doubles and E bid 2@h|pg||
pc|s9|nt|Walddk4: Even on that lead, and with hearts 3-2, it can't make|pg||
nt|chick: there is no such thing as a preempt when opps have already quit bidding :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree Chick |pg||
nt|hawe45:  The 800 was only 500 in OR - same contract, and same 2 NT from West|pg||
nt|xenya: that's true, Hans|pg||
nt|yuval10: 3NT is a bad contract but can be made|pg||
nt|yuval10: by double finessing the @d's|pg||
nt|haans: a make if no @D loser|pg||
nt|daman: if he doesn't cover   he might only get 5|pg||
nt|ralfwil: perhaps that´s why:)|pg||
nt|othered1: it's a matter of disclosure to the opponents and complex methods (not multi which isn't very tough to grasp) may need advance preparation.|pg||
nt|haans: ty :)|pg||
pc|sT|nt|szalay: I think South could bid 4@H with 3 aces over 3@S|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that would help East to see South has only a @h card|pg||
nt|h_karluk: yes worst 4/3 moysian fit, good bid as pass out of question|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|szalay: imagine North has spade Q instead of K of @H|pg||
nt|sybarra: so -1 here|pg||
nt|szalay: we can talk cause its an absolutely uniteresting making 2@S|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 3N seems like it should be doubled, but I really cannot see doubling from either side|pg||
nt|yo_yo: I am sure Verbeek is a great player but I am not keen on some of his bidding|pg||
nt|yo_yo: maybe I'm old fasioned|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i like a good suit vulnerable|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think 4 years ago it was my 1st Vugraph experience. i was assigned to White House Juniors. Then I remembered Navratilova (famous tennis player)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I cannot imagine to open with 3@c on hand like Ns|pg||
nt|yo_yo: she's too old to be a junior!|pg||
nt|h_karluk: she admits her wrong thinking abt those days|pg||
nt|tomi2: since they play a strong club system they cannot have so many extras here|pg||
pc|d9|nt|h_karluk: allright, that makes a sense|pg||
nt|haans: but East could have had 6 spades|pg||
pc|d4|nt|haans: 1st interesting deal|pg||
nt|othered1: I'm not used to this style.  Did 3@H guarantee at least 2@H at this level?  If not, east's auction is a crap shoot.|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Howard should get the @C right after the WJO|pg||
nt|haans: 3@H did show i like spades|pg||
pc|dK|nt|Walddk4: Our match in roúnd 3, in about 40 minutes, is USA vs Sweden|pg||
nt|haans: he he|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: uh oh|pg||
nt|daman: sweet|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I see your point, PO. The solution is perhaps to let a 2NT rebid be ambiguous and forcing. Then you have two ways of showing a singleton, either directly or via 2NT after responder ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: asks for clarification|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but i suppose 3@c wasn't constructive raise|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: Manno reading the system book right now|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|haans: we all seen it|pg||
nt|haans: first xx 3S|pg||
nt|yo_yo: do you mean her aggression?|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dJ|nt|haans: i have not seen Blue clubs having what is needed for many years But this time yes|pg||
nt|daman: now @S @S|pg||
nt|h_karluk: just overtake 3rd @d J with Q|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ady: should make the rest |pg||
nt|sharkey: good point - especially since dummy is dead|pg||
nt|haans: some play 2@H natural of weak raise|pg||
nt|haans: endplay possible|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 2 entries to table, likely would try @c hook 1stly towards Q|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|s3|nt|daman: do we think North should have pulled?|pg||
nt|mcphee: will be all over soon and they will not have to worry about @D|pg||
nt|po-s: Hamdi, I´m impressed|pg||

nt|hawe45:  Dennis is ready for 8 tricks now|pg||
nt|haans: for many years Garozzo belive showing distributionj first better that showing controls|pg||
nt|haans: Franchi played in right tempo|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: Nowosadzki-Wiankowski are known as a fast pair around the junior circuit. |pg||
nt|h_karluk: 5-0 @s break 4 %|pg||

nt|h_karluk: however could set|pg||
nt|sharkey: coulda - woulda .....|pg||
nt|haans: small @D is good play again 4-2|pg||
nt|copeyj: some pairs play 2NT as artificial raises - works well but will generally mean you lose something elsewhere - like you have to open all 18-19 balanced hands 1@C not 1@D for example|pg||
nt|mcphee: I think Kath was referring to a @D lead from S|pg||
nt|yo_yo: did that awful preempt push them too high?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: with 6/4 maybe a rebid problem, otherwise not - i suppose|pg||
nt|haans: time for he he|pg||
nt|haans: better to play 3@Hx (no clubs lead)|pg||
nt|petergill: Results http://www.nbbportal.nl/1003/ then click on Competitie then on White House Juniors |pg||
nt|ralfwil: a sigh of releife from E?|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: mmm he just said : "all, twelve"|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: any one for 6@C|pg||
nt|ady: 6@C  easy to make for n/s|pg||
nt|sybarra: nice lead director |pg||
nt|szalay: tough, nearly impossible slam to bid|pg||
nt|ady: hi Frank|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: Hiya Frank|pg||
nt|haans: hi :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  6-6 fit, rare up here in Denmark|pg||
nt|szalay: 3 slams make as N-S|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 6@C/@D|pg||
nt|szalay: do u use different shuffling machine there?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Probably|pg||
nt|haans: interesting hands|pg||
nt|daman: heard them in a poker game with bocchi|pg||
nt|h_karluk: yes Kath, you know uncontrolled power is not a good thing to fix problems|pg||
nt|ritong: very nice slam|pg||
nt|h_karluk: now 27/13|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 21-19 now, dangerous layout|pg||
mb|1C|nt|vugraphzeg: big tell, to speak in poker terms: now Adam DOES alert|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i was :)|pg||
mb|d|nt|h_karluk: you know sometimes even a nickel is important :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: rite :)|pg||
nt|ady: part score hand|pg||
nt|szalay: easy looking 4@H...but: gotta play carefully cause of bad trump break|pg||
nt|szalay: 6@S is makes yet|pg||
nt|szalay: but that is really terrible|pg||
nt|rnmalik: and 6@C|pg||
nt|szalay: personally I wd bid 6@C as south, P/C|pg||
nt|haans: you have to fight hard for every hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: likely 3 nt again or @D slam? |pg||
nt|haans: 6@S no make|pg||
nt|othered1: At other colors, I wouldn't hate a 1N overcall by south|pg||
mb|1H!|nt|h_karluk: q : x or 2N or 2@d?|pg||
nt|haans: good bid 1nt or more no spade|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 11 there|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and i saw N was leader|pg||
nt|othered1: if it were strong|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: wd, Brigitta|pg||
nt|daman: hhhrrrmmmmm|pg||
nt|haans: Akkol still not happy but soon|pg||
nt|daman: Hopefully South won't hang his partner|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: uh oh|pg||
nt|haans: Tekir you have no pass notes?|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: she has gotten the hang of things|pg||
nt|daman: he has a great hand but he has to be conservative|pg||
nt|haans: Soth have no bid|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i see 12 tricks with in spired guess in spades|pg||
nt|yo_yo: you are a philosopher Hamdi |pg||
nt|haans: 1@S opening?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: do you agree with 2N?|pg||
nt|pierced: no :)|pg||
nt|xenya: each hand has a singleton -- N even 2...|pg||
nt|xenya: 4@H looks plausible now... |pg||
nt|petergill: Australia has potential good boards on Bds 9 and 10, so we will not worry about being down 0 - 22|pg||
mb|1S|nt|szalay: dont see other option than 3N now by North|pg||
nt|haans: urrk|pg||
nt|daman: sorry    she|pg||
nt|Walddk4: No more bad slams, please :)|pg||
nt|copeyj: well @D slam is pretty awful so I think 3NT|pg||
nt|mcphee: no no world team are leader:)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: omg, you are not the only one described me so, but thanks :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: seems N is a solo performer|pg||
nt|yo_yo: do we like that 3@S?|pg||
nt|yuval10: if E finds the X here....|pg||
nt|yuval10: he knows NS are short in points and he has a singel in P's suit. can't be any better for defense|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzeg: connection was rather slow|pg||
nt|szalay: personally my preference list by Sout over 1@H is:|pg||
nt|szalay: pass, 1N....period....2@C|pg||
nt|haans: suprised they do not play trf here|pg||
nt|sharkey: if it's a "coulda" - probably too close to x at IMPs|pg||
nt|ady: west overcall on 4 card suit understandable|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our next match (and last today) in about 40 minutes: Norway vs Italy|pg||
nt|haans: South endbid :)|pg||
nt|szalay: with likely plus for n-s, anyway|pg||
nt|pelu: easy 1@s - u dont X on 5 card major exp u are very strong|pg||
nt|rnmalik: X must with this hand|pg||
nt|szalay: in this case often happens save over 7@C:)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Why not 5 NT by South - pick a minor - and 6 @C =  MY suit|pg||
nt|chick: conservative?  juniors?  they are fearless!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I like "pretty awful"|pg||
nt|haans: 3@H means suits not 3-2 (that often)|pg||
nt|haans: so keept it cool|pg||
nt|haans: low spade to t and a slow make in slam|pg||
nt|marlowepi: low spade to ten is the winner, but from a technical/statistical standpoint it is the worst of the three ways to try and pick up the whole spade suit|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it wins only against stiff nine, and there are two alternatives each of which is twice as good|pg||
nt|haans: agree to that|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: North told East that she doesn't know what to bid|pg||
nt|marlowepi: playing an honor from dummy first succeeds in two cases (stiff J/Q), and triple-finessing W also wins in two cases|pg||
nt|marlowepi: how does that differ from simply huddling? does a trance mean "i know what to bid, but i want you to think i don't" ? :):)|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: I don't know.. she just told it, i think it means more, I have no clue, rather than I have to make a choice between 2 bids|pg||
nt|haans: for beginner yes that who the bid|pg||
nt|ralfwil: no|pg||
nt|ritong: dwyer should show interest for @cs|pg||
nt|haans: in sweden that mean 6@C+ singel @H|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @d breaks evenly, 35.6 pct, stiff @h, @c Q..everything is on the right spot|pg||
nt|haans: now u have a choice|pg||
nt|haans: strongish|pg||
nt|yuval10: wd|pg||
nt|han: Alerted?|pg||
nt|han: I'm surprised that east didn't bid diamonds by the way|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: yes, dunno why, Ph is writing it down|pg||
nt|ralfwil: perhaps non forcing|pg||
nt|han: west doubled and he has 5 diamonds|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: not alerted at the other side though|pg||
mb|2S|nt|po-s: better to bid 2H - then East will be reluctant to bid NT|pg||
nt|copeyj: 3@S here showing @S stop and concern about @H|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe be playing this from side I did not expect |pg||
nt|haans: 3@S showing spade stopper hearts ???|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The grand slam hand is played in 6@D next door|pg||
nt|copeyj: very surprising|pg||
nt|haans: u mean the automatic grand?|pg||
nt|sybarra: the 14+ trick slam |pg||
nt|copeyj: wonder if Nab is worried that 3@S is asking|pg||
nt|copeyj: must be I guess|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i would not try to be his p even for a while|pg||
nt|yo_yo: :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i hope we never meet Verbeek , he wont be pleased with us|pg||
nt|ralfwil: not 4@c on E either|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i ignore players who likes to play both sides of the table|pg||
nt|ralfwil: sry 4@d|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If ny partner bids like that I have enough for 5@d|pg||
nt|ralfwil: my...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so east convinced himself to join the fiesta|pg||
nt|yo_yo: martine verbeek,  a lady!|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i've decided I like her bidding after all|pg||
nt|h_karluk: tarzan in the trouble|pg||
nt|h_karluk: sorry Miss Verbeek, how could i know, no photo available there|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: martine is not here she is not a junior any more (for several Years). This is Tim |pg||
nt|yo_yo: specs now telling me it's Erik or Tim|pg||
nt|han: thanks|pg||
mb|3D|nt|szalay: do u see any reason not to pass 2@H?|pg||
nt|szalay: or a strength showing double is an option yet|pg||
nt|xenya: on 3, where Israel bid up to 5@D here, the Poles in the other room reached an even worse contract -- 3N -- 3 off and 3 imps to Israel |pg||
nt|h_karluk: in new year teams, we were tied 42-42, then 3 more extension boards, again tied, and last board just won with 1 IMP |pg||
nt|szalay: personally I wd bid 3N over 2N|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: there's you slam|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 13 IMPs to France but they may get most of them back on the very next hand|pg||
nt|Walddk4: All of them in fact|pg||
nt|sybarra: these are not beginners |pg||
nt|haans: 5nt slam force?|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: opposite a 12-14 Nt?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: uh-oh, the worst of all possible choices.......slow double|pg||
nt|haans: in polish i know 2@C show 15+|pg||
nt|han: 3@d now|pg||
nt|han: Doesn't seem right to pass initially and then bid 3@d|pg||
mb|3S|nt|VugraphPl1: last board   thanks all |pg||
nt|daman: -1|pg||
nt|haans: i think 6@S was insulting p|pg||
nt|daman: unless they completely misdefend|pg||
nt|copeyj: can get away with this - can make 5@C or @D I think |pg||
nt|sybarra: 5 @C might stand a better chance |pg||
nt|othered1: North is embarking on a painstaking auction.  |pg||
nt|haans: funny bidding here|pg||
mb|p|nt|VugraphPl1: http://michzimny.pl/bridge/2010/pila/gp.html|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 @D by S?|pg||
nt|xenya: what do you think about N's double?|pg||
nt|frankaus: X do something sensible is a reasonable call |pg||
nt|sybarra: agressive?|pg||
nt|szalay: its normal, imho|pg||
nt|xenya: is it penalty?|pg||
nt|szalay: especially if u play sound overcalls..and send greetings to East for reopen|pg||
nt|xenya: penalty-orinted i should say|pg||
nt|szalay: 8-10, bid sthg, imho|pg||
nt|szalay: I doubt it|pg||
nt|frankaus: no here  - opps bid & raise  X = t/o|pg||
nt|szalay: btw if South passes and North bids @C a BIT easier, but isnt easy yet|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but makes with a lucky @d hook|pg||
nt|szalay: they play: minor ALWAYS P/C|pg||
nt|szalay: and NT means: I have a suit|pg||
nt|haans: assume 3nt show 5 @H puppet variation|pg||
nt|xenya: interesting 3N rebid: partner, i want to be in 3N even if you have 4 hearts? |pg||
nt|yuval10: there are no difficulties here with the play|pg||
nt|haans: 3@H = no major |pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: 3NT showing hearts, yes|pg||
nt|xenya: ah i see|pg||
nt|chick: actually, most of the interest in these hands has been the bidding|pg||
nt|haans: fiver|pg||
nt|xenya: thanks|pg||
nt|haans: singel @H is here we go|pg||
nt|h_karluk: for hard times both @s honours are onside|pg||
nt|ritong: it needs a tornado to beat slam here|pg||
nt|haans: @D 3-3|pg||
nt|xenya: at least 1 down, could be 2|pg||
nt|yuval10: W should decide if to signel @d or @c, both cases he needs the Ace with P....|pg||
nt|yuval10: tough call|pg||
nt|h_karluk: passed hand's D commendable or not, i ve some doubts abt that question|pg||
nt|haans: opps may get a lead doublöe|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but 3nt on the right hand|pg||
nt|han: I would say bid 2@d immediately and be silent thereafter|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: I think North can double 4@S quite confidently|pg||
nt|szalay: or 3N yet..J9xxx in 1 suit, AK9x in other|pg||
nt|pelu: @D now will set up a ruff for East|pg||
nt|marlowepi: could be a director call|pg||
nt|marlowepi: slam makes on spade to ten|pg||
nt|haans: yep for sure |pg||
nt|rich89: what is 1@h?|pg||
nt|yuval10: walsh perhaps|pg||
nt|yuval10: might have longer @d's|pg||
nt|h_karluk: S lucky enough his p doesn't have 5@d and 4@c|pg||
nt|rich89: oh|pg||
nt|vbman: 3cl now|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: I dont like to play lowlevel dbls as penalty|pg||
nt|xenya: so it was for minors|pg||
nt|szalay: good point, Frank|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: Lotan put the Hoody of the sweater on his head after being doubled|pg||
nt|szalay: to lead stiff in pds suit is tempting|pg||
nt|pelu: the set look boring - but in almost all matches we have seen strang mistakes that cist - here good bridge|pg||
nt|hawe45:  OK|pg||
nt|copeyj: notice the @C suit here|pg||
nt|copeyj: declarer can afford one loser in @C and one in @H|pg||
nt|sybarra: none of these slams are "pretty"|pg||
nt|haans: 3@S very close|pg||
nt|sybarra: or makeable?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but in practice will fail|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: but 3@H is 500? |pg||
nt|marlowepi: double??|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: no @H lead pls partner|pg||
nt|haans: psych?|pg||
nt|ritong: double= pls lead something else|pg||
nt|haans: or negative double = do not lead my suit|pg||
nt|haans: they made it an easy slam|pg||
nt|haans: i think |pg||
nt|h_karluk: i took my breath, don't tell me 5@c passed pls :)|pg||
nt|ritong: bizarre|pg||
nt|ritong: maybe 4@d was something else than a cue|pg||
nt|haans: 5@C deny spade control????|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: they play 2@C opener as majors|pg||
pc|dA|nt|haans: what did x mean?|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: Takeout?|pg||
nt|haans: their are at least 3 variation of puppet so i refuse to play any online|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i am hairless and fearless, they are supposed to have fresh and strong hairs :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: N feels quite insistant with that hand |pg||
nt|haans: ok|pg||
nt|othered1: north "knows" EW have at least 8@H between them|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes South denied a major|pg||
nt|han: On this hand there is a good chance that NS would not find their spade fit|pg||
pc|d2|nt|hawe45:  E/W got the chance...|pg||
nt|sharkey: this match could be a blowout|pg||
nt|haans: can East ever have 4 spades|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Yes - we all know, what England RED means - after this battle|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: typical agressive junior double|pg||
nt|frankaus: t/o do something sensible|pg||
nt|haans: many bid 1@S to show five x to show 4 |pg||
nt|h_karluk: 2@h+4@c+1@s + 5@d are his tricks|pg||
nt|szalay: with 28-29 hcp 3N generally is safer in 2 balanced hands, cause no bad trump break|pg||
nt|chick: 3@C may be checkback|pg||
nt|haans: 4@D may be ace ask|pg||
nt|ritong: i guess so, yes|pg||
nt|tomi2: 4@D was RKC, 5@C the response|pg||
nt|tomi2: 1NT was 14-16|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i am ok to play this as uncontested 1N (15-17); 3@h (mild slam invite on @c suit. Anyone tried that Bobby Goldman method ?|pg||
pc|d4|nt|hawe45:  Dangerous double - no defence against 4 @C|pg||
nt|sharkey: I like Dbl instead of 2@S - EW lost the whole 1 level thus they end up in this hopeless contract|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But played by South, 3 NT is percect - NOT by North|pg||
nt|april7: lets see whether EW stays also out of 4@S|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i stand on my answer whichever direction leads|pg||
nt|po-s: did they know now ---yes|pg||
nt|mcphee: at last landing in 4@S on the final bid of the auction|pg||
nt|h_karluk: after 2 initial pass he believed picked his best over double, seems recognized as natural|pg||
nt|sybarra: can scramble this one home with the good @D spots |pg||
nt|haans: no aces so weak 12 |pg||
nt|petergill: I think 2@S was artificial GF enquiry, 3@C a reply, 3@D enquired, West showed balanced minimum|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|frankaus: if u beat it 1 - what have u gained  - canu really expect to beat it 2 or more?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: he leads, and has @d A, planned after @s A knocked out wld score many tricks to set|pg||
nt|po-s: 5D is laydown|pg||
nt|copeyj: so can play for either JT onside or K onside by playing one to the 9|pg||
nt|april7: after 3NT by E, W could have passed with 3-3-3-4|pg||
nt|h_karluk: friendly neighbor lead|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i dont like that lead|pg||
nt|mcphee: I am not at all sure that is correct April|pg||
nt|mcphee: the lack of @H stop facing what may be 2 small is not all the thrilling to play 3N|pg||
nt|april7: depends what 3NT meqans after 3@H by W|pg||
nt|haans: assume that mean no king|pg||
nt|ritong: well done, excellent spot|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|szalay: not to play Q was a clear error, imho|pg||
nt|szalay: ruff and trump now|pg||
nt|drorp: hashavti ze helgemo hamavrik mibenehem|pg||
nt|ady: bold action from east     found partner with a useful hand including 4 clubs|pg||
nt|haans: may we see a hearts lead?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Yes, @C9 is a significant card|pg||
nt|copeyj: you can in fact make this with an overtrick|pg||
nt|yuval10: hmmmm|pg||
pc|dT|nt|hawe45:  To me, this is the 3rd best lead from the East-hand|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Miss/Mrs Anneke thanks for emergency help :)|pg||
pc|d7|nt|po-s: why not another club by East?|pg||
nt|haans: yes i can read (sry)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: now i see 9 tricks|pg||
nt|ritong: since @s KQ are on, it will go fast|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.nbbportal.nl/1003/|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|sybarra: hate to lead a @H with the South holding |pg||
nt|haans: and playing by east|pg||
nt|othered1: Very friendly minor suit positions give north a chance to make this easily.  Trump lead limits options|pg||
nt|yuval10: now it makes i believe|pg||
nt|han: if declarer can play spades often enough from the north side|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a classic play in @s to only have one loss. Small from dummy  and depending on what E does|pg||
nt|han: he can play them for 1 loser|pg||
pc|s3|nt|szalay: its strange to me that no one plays 3@C as puppet to 3@D: in that case u can stop in 3@D (crucial if u respond 1M with longer @Ds)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Only @H is worse|pg||
nt|Walddk4: As expected, the Dutch pair stopped short of slam on board 5|pg||
pc|s2|nt|hawe45:  Well done - Jack = @D|pg||
nt|sharkey: If S had @CK this wud make|pg||
nt|haans: but if they have not hearts stopper hearts lead good|pg||
nt|po-s: how did Drijver know that partner had diamond support?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: A wife always has support for her husband|pg||
nt|haans: 3nt a make at or 2|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|h_karluk: oh sorry i am wrong at @d|pg||
nt|yo_yo: @D lie nicely|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and luckily @c K at his partner|pg||
nt|Walddk4: They may not quite be married yet, but ...|pg||
nt|copeyj: he can probably work out his partner has doubleton @S from the auction and that sort of suggests some @Ds, maybe if Nab had had lots of @C or something she would have acted over ...|pg||
nt|copeyj: 2@C i dont know|pg||
nt|haans: hurray|pg||
nt|xenya: yes|pg||
nt|han: ok this makes it easier|pg||
pc|sT|nt|szalay: making now|pg||
nt|pelu: 10 tricks on cross-ruff|pg||
nt|ady: could have got 200 from 1NTX|pg||
nt|po-s: and after this declarer play she might not want to|pg||
nt|ritong: so they reasonably stop in game with 31 hcp at best, balanced both hands|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Tim   thanks|pg||
nt|h_karluk: can you imagine? our skilled operator shout as " hey i am a man!' omg then i am a dead meat, i m really poor to guess foreign names|pg||
nt|yo_yo: I am afraid the Dutch arent taking kindly to our views of Verbeek :)|pg||
nt|othered1: balanced by the strong upgrade  you give the @DQ|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|haans: a make|pg||
nt|marlowepi: to all specs who have written me: i know it means don;t lead a heart, but it is far from clear that E wants to send that message, especially since the call gives NS more options in ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: th bidding|pg||
pc|s4|nt|szalay: bad news: he knows going down|pg||
nt|szalay: good one: 50/trick|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|szalay: N-S deserved their fate|pg||
nt|szalay: oops|pg||
nt|haans: 2@C may be the winner|pg||
pc|hA|nt|szalay: North was in driving seat at trick 2|pg||
nt|szalay: he forget to play @D early...it wasnt so bad: after @C lead he fears of @C ruff...not now|pg||
nt|daman: the only way to make this is the Sominex Coup    take 20 minutes to play the hand...put the opps to sleep....and make a false claim which they accept|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i prefer to use red card whenever i am sure abt guaranteed off 2 at my collection|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ralfwil: For me a @d on 4@d is not so far away with all this @h behind|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sharkey: Indeed - things are going the Danes' way|pg||
nt|hawe45:  West can play the @H 3 to the 4...|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Rare also|pg||
nt|po-s: I see ten|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|szalay: he MUST solve it with xxxx trumps|pg||
nt|yuval10: and no X|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and S has no other solution than play for @sQ10|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|szalay: if we have small trumps, ruff and lead trumps generally the best move|pg||
nt|szalay: loser on loser, pls|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and say lead came by 3rd/5th, so deduct 10 from 2, 8 cards higher, 2 at table, 3 at hand, so playing Q safe and brings a tempo ahead, also preserves a further entry |pg||
nt|april7: N had a normal @H lead after this auction,but didn't lead it|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes lose 2@D|pg||
nt|yo_yo: I have to give him his due, he is certainly pushing his opponents around|pg||
nt|h_karluk: no offense intended, just trying to do tech analyses with some humour here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a Double. sry!|pg||
nt|yo_yo: and no Jan, no challenge match for money  ( i would lose)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: well, i think say NE were partners ...i guess they shld use westinghouse break sys ;-)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|szalay: is it true?|pg||
nt|xenya: this can't be right|pg||
nt|Walddk4: He did not treasure the @C9, a pity|pg||
nt|haans: 3nt at or|pg||
nt|po-s: down now it seems|pg||
nt|copeyj: he knows the likely @C distribution but now has to guess if south started with KJX or JTX|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Against good players it is with the odds to go down now|pg||
nt|sybarra: and there is bd 5 |pg||
nt|ritong: no 4/0 trump break, just claim now|pg||
pc|h5|nt|sybarra: 13 back to Neth. |pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|haans: who plays J whit KJx|pg||
nt|h_karluk: if trumps were 3 times in West then South may have a chance to park @d loser while @c finesse successfully guessed ( in fact two way )|pg||
pc|s7|nt|h_karluk: now @c A and @c J then @d J pitch even available, just transfers the ruff|pg||
pc|sK|nt|april7: since @D are 3-3 W has 10 tricks|pg||
nt|rich89: 8 triks|pg||
nt|vbman: an imp is coming?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|h_karluk: @dA marked|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Well, he survived, but we are not going to compliment him for his line|pg||
nt|yuval10: perhaps now|pg||
nt|yuval10: has no choice but to ruff and play @c's the right way|pg||
nt|rich89: 9 now|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: nabil showing AJ|pg||
mc|10|nt|Walddk4: A good player does, Hans, and Volcker is|pg||
nt|ralfwil: only 9 - or?|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: im asking them|pg||
nt|han: sure looks like 140|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 2@d 1 @s and 1@c|pg||

nt|hawe45:  A void in every second board or so|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and 5-0 break, just 4 %|pg||
nt|haans: sad really|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that's the penultimate board and huge difference|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: I'm strung between seeing Andy (Hung) win, since he's a good friend and see my team lose... Hmmmmm|pg||
nt|daman: credit to the Italians for bouncing NS into a hopeless slam|pg||
nt|daman: things will calm down a bid    just a partscore|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: still they are yelling at each other, wish I would have pait better attention during my Latin classes|pg||
nt|po-s: forum - did you find that?|pg||
nt|xenya: good small spade from N, holding declarer to 9 |pg||
nt|haans: good point roland|pg||
nt|april7: strong pass system???|pg||
nt|h_karluk: trump promo|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that would be a bloody board|pg||
nt|h_karluk: the penultimate board|pg||
nt|yuval10: W couldn't have imagined 7 @c's with P, was hoping for K fifth|pg||
nt|xenya: frankly speaking, i don't like E's double very much -- hope i'm not resulting|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: EW don't seem to be so happy anymore|pg||
nt|petergill: Four boards scored, 0 - 27, even I am starting to worry just a little bit|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|sharkey: EW have a lucky make in 5@D - limiting @D losers to 1|pg||
nt|haans: 30 min to next session|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ah well  maybe he got the wrong count|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 4@s ok for ew say allowed, 2@s+1@h losers|pg||
mb|d|nt|szalay: in my humble opinion this level of the play is not good at U20 yet|pg||
nt|frankaus: -470 is not a good number on a scoresheet|pg||
nt|szalay: I think at least 8 serious mistakes in 8 bds|pg||
nt|ady: 20-20 again   no fit    |pg||
nt|ady: whoever plays likely to go down|pg||
nt|yuval10: very quick session it was|pg||
nt|pelu: a @d-lead set up @DJ to discard for a major-loser|pg||
nt|ady: must have slipped in defence to let 3@C through|pg||
nt|h_karluk: well, i do not see any reason to begin with 3@c at 1st seat|pg||
nt|pelu: but defense could still kill @dJ by ruff|pg||
nt|ady: diamond lead may set up J@D  but that can beruffed out when west wins ace of clubs|pg||
nt|haans: but why do N wait|pg||
nt|haans: easy pass|pg||
nt|pelu: with screen we often have 2 bids a time|pg||
nt|h_karluk: when you use a preempt at 3 level at 1st seat that's only against economy of space principle|pg||
nt|pelu: so it could be East in problem|pg||
nt|haans: pass all|pg||
nt|h_karluk: well, maybe they did not read our friendly yellow Gerardo's profile : rushers are added to enemy list :)|pg||
nt|haans: we got a little nervous there|pg||
nt|haans: never wrong :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: another grand but in @h|pg||
nt|petergill: Is 7@H biddable.|pg||
nt|han: 2@c is either weak with diamonds, or something strong|pg||
nt|han: very common in the netherlands|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|yo_yo: East will surely bid @D  |pg||
nt|h_karluk: you go to hunt but sometimes find yourself as hunted|pg||
nt|han: double by west shows values I imagine|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|ady: this has esculated|pg||
nt|haans: but 4@S a make 2|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: the hand got rotated|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think i would prefer 4@s|pg||
nt|pelu: would u bid 3@D?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: why not|pg||
nt|haans: if u pass 3@C sitting west can you miss game then?|pg||
nt|szalay: 1@S probably denies 4card @S, values|pg||
nt|szalay: I hate this convention, but no time to discuss it now|pg||
nt|ralfwil: What do you prefer on E - D or 5@d?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 21-19 and from this hat...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: lekely 4@s now|pg||
nt|h_karluk: *likely|pg||
nt|othered1: strong NT in OR preempted EW out of their @S partial.  1@C opening, let them in as would I.|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: operator, undo?|pg||
nt|haans: sry :(|pg||
nt|rnmalik: very different bidding as compared to OR|pg||
nt|yuval10: W on the other room did very well by leading small @c against 3NT, let's see if it will be the same here|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i meant in case ruff to 2nd @d, but in dd underlead from @h AK and set 4@s|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1NT = spades|pg||
mb|3S|nt|szalay: 2@D: NF (std Polish approx.)|pg||
nt|pelu: with a better @h-suit u could open 1@H but not with J high|pg||
nt|sybarra: just another "exciting" hand|pg||
nt|haans: i assume spade + minor (may be 4 @S??)|pg||
nt|haans: easiest @D to king = 9|pg||
nt|xenya: i don't understand this auction|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: 2@c was alerted I think, but I don't know what it means|pg||
nt|haans: 2@D must be conventional|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: he really bid 2H|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that's a fun bid, transfer overcall  passed |pg||
nt|h_karluk: in my book, 2@h tragedy|pg||
nt|mcphee: E can now find the @H lead to 3N which will cause a moments grief untill declarer sees dummy:)|pg||
nt|april7: 2 or 3NT? or is 2NT Lebensohl?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i can live with a simple 1@s overcall|pg||
nt|jcwla: Sorry - back.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: oh brasilians method|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 2@C Gazzilli I suspect|pg||
nt|rich89: some imp for italy here i think|pg||
nt|yuval10: 2@c probably gazzili|pg||
nt|rich89: y gazzilli|pg||
nt|yuval10: if they can find the excellent slam|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 2@d-2N-3@s-4@d might do it|pg||
nt|haans: as long as its partials its ok|pg||
nt|yuval10: but i think he should've known that S has at least 3 @s's ( P didn't support ) and at least 7 @h's so 3 @c's can barely fit into declarer's hand|pg||
nt|pierced: for me dbl show single @s|pg||
nt|yuval10: X was perfect|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: sorry for all the mistakes, but this laptop is screwing things up|pg||
nt|petergill: At least we Aussies have our regular partnership EW. The scratch partnership in the team of five is NS at the other table. |pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: 3@C was @S raise|pg||
nt|sybarra: undoubled, that is good news |pg||
nt|ady: even undoubled  east west will lose several imps|pg||
nt|haans: spade Q lead :)|pg||
nt|othered1: 650 is a really nice result, since you can be beaten off the top with @S lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: may see N come in?|pg||
nt|othered1: 2@S is high enough, but east may get to a lawful 3.|pg||
mb|4S|nt|yuval10: OR led @d, let's see if they'll lead it again here|pg||
nt|yuval10: perhaps will opt to a @s|pg||
nt|h_karluk: seems bidding directions are wrong|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: nono, I bid correctly|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Only 180 degrees|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: cards are wrong. North is dealer but east has the west cards etc|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Not me|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think N would buy to 2@s|pg||
nt|szalay: double, pls|pg||
nt|chick: lebensohl sequence here|pg||
nt|yuval10: 2NT follows by 3@s i believe to ask stayman with @s stopper|pg||
nt|haans: 2 suits to cover |pg||
nt|haans: a good bid now is xx|pg||
nt|haans: if u have talked about it|pg||
nt|haans: dealy = no map |pg||
nt|chick: what would you play XX as, if you were S?|pg||
nt|xenya: tough for NS -- looks like they are in for a minus score now no matter what they might do|pg||
nt|po-s: - and if it means what you have agreed...|pg||
nt|haans: that would help|pg||
nt|yuval10: i only have pass and direct 3@s here.... Pass force for XX from S|pg||
nt|haans: hi sudden|pg||
nt|haans: how to find 5@D|pg||
nt|april7: true|pg||
nt|mcphee: and even seeing dummy may not make life so pleasing|pg||
nt|ritong: wb jordan|pg||
nt|yo_yo: now it is home|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: doomed|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Rotten suit|pg||
nt|h_karluk: we will see likely or not, time to watch the process|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 3 jump encourages|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzeg: north and south also switched cards|pg||
nt|pelu: spects : 9-1 for pass :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: Kib avg age, Peter? :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i cannot use a double there because of @s Ax, i know the ovecall suit quality is not bright there |pg||
nt|haans: very like bidding prempt after prempt |pg||
nt|ady: this will be a slaughter|pg||
nt|haans: you just dont do that|pg||
nt|sybarra: and its j high with no good spots!|pg||
nt|hawe45:  In OR, South was no junior - passed in first hand, is that allowed in a junior-match?|pg||
nt|szalay: does anyone know meaning of bids?|pg||
nt|daman: no reason for South to bid|pg||
nt|chick: the OR has only played 5 boards (per the Movie), so it may be more than 30 minutes :)|pg||
nt|haans: fight every board|pg||
nt|xenya: anyway they reached a nice contract |pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: W: I hope you have really bad cards|pg||
nt|sybarra: puts pard (Nab) in difficult position |pg||
nt|othered1: I hate to lose 6 imps.  |pg||
nt|h_karluk: no worries please, you go well|pg||
nt|xenya: what if NS have the @SA?|pg||
nt|yuval10: then P has A@h|pg||
nt|yuval10: or A@c|pg||
nt|yuval10: or any other entry|pg||
nt|xenya: hopefully, yes|pg||
nt|petergill: 2NT GF Jacoby |pg||
nt|ralfwil: can be a little bit difficult if E cant show his 5-4 in @h and @c|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@H extras, no singleton|pg||
nt|haans: need special responses to j|pg||
nt|petergill: cues, 1st or 2nd round control|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: to me good lead, could cost worse to a @d lead|pg||
nt|daman: who is foing the yelling now?|pg||

nt|mcphee: uh oh accident|pg||
nt|haans: may get 2nd chance|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Whibley will run for home|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|haans: boring :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: thought he might come in over 2 @D |pg||
nt|yuval10: in 25, N indeed opened 2@h but EW managed to reach the top spot of 5@c|pg||
nt|h_karluk: maybe the question should be how did they dare 4@h in vuln, i don't think they were dying to be victims while no obvious game for EW|pg||
nt|h_karluk: in nonvul|pg||
nt|yuval10: just made and 3 imps to Israel that dodged a bullet there|pg||
nt|xenya: on 25, the French reached 5@C -- a better contract than 3N -- losing 3 imps|pg||
pc|dK|nt|sharkey: the players probably took the wrong cards out|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: nope they all took their own slot|pg||
nt|sharkey: score 33-0 to Denmark and more to come...|pg||
nt|chick: in an auction like this, I would play 4@C as Stayman, but no idea what they do|pg||
nt|sybarra: yikes guys!! |pg||
nt|haans: Haans: who plays J whit KJx Walddk4: A good player does, Hans, and Volcker is doc_jo: is volcker a good player??? ->doc_jo: Roland say and Roland ... |pg||
nt|haans: puppet|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i cannot blame Tarnovski plays solo with such holding and vulnerability|pg||
nt|h_karluk: however i would demand @d J instead of stiff @c J|pg||
nt|ritong: he tried his best to push them a level higher and succeeded|pg||
nt|h_karluk: true|pg||
nt|ritong: wish him to resist to the @c jack shift|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: hmm, I think N is worth a cue|pg||
nt|rich89: lol|pg||
nt|h_karluk: agreed|pg||
nt|haans: cue will not find grand|pg||
pc|dA|nt|szalay: I confess I could pass as East automatically|pg||
nt|szalay: over 1@C|pg||
nt|daman: they just got +100 from thin air|pg||
nt|xenya: W has his hope i think |pg||
nt|yo_yo: maybe Nabil thought 3@C stronger than lebensohl 2NT?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: omg they bought 5@h|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, all.  but in context of gazzilli how/what wouldnorth cue?|pg||
pc|d4|nt|sybarra: may make 6 now |pg||
nt|haans: holy ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: too much technical stuff for me, i only know on/off button and how to use a mouse :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: you're advanced Hamdi...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: omg, after long years i learnt to use email system:)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  What is e-mail...?|pg||
nt|sharkey: ask Hamdo hans :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: ik heb een geheel gedraaid spel. Kan je een arbiter roepen?|pg||
nt|sharkey: Hamdi|pg||
nt|h_karluk: at start i thought, some guy's name in Venezuala, bcos i saw a video abt it |pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: tell oops was trying to contact someone else in the building|pg||
nt|hawe45:  And you might invite with 4 NT directly also|pg||
nt|szalay: well done Brigitta|pg||
nt|rnmalik: some imps coming your way with X also|pg||
nt|szalay: she wears the jeans|pg||
nt|marlowepi: expect trunmpo lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: std. puppet auction |pg||
nt|ralfwil: I think this is easier with Stenbergs Hans?|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|frankaus: pass is the hardest bid to master in bridge :)|pg||
nt|szalay: light openings and overcalls they style can live cause another side|pg||
nt|ady: heart shift  best|pg||
nt|rnmalik: no other choice I think|pg||
nt|ady: hand 16 where west was down 1 in 4@H doubled   in OR  n/s made 4@D re-doubled|pg||
nt|ady: was 11 imps for world team|pg||
nt|rnmalik: compensation here for NS might gain some|pg||
nt|pelu: 4 out of 5 : I am junior :):)|pg||
nt|haans: psych|pg||
nt|jcwla: 16 means 12 big ones to Israel - they made 2@S N/S here and 5@C E/W there|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Hi Ed|pg||
nt|yo_yo: too difficult to find a @S lead|pg||
nt|han: if declarer finesses in spades he'll go down|pg||
nt|han: north will play another diamond and get another trump trick with his spade 10, with a club still coming|pg||
pc|sA|nt|hawe45:  Wonder what 1 @S was - since East introduced a suit with 7-6-5-4 at the 4-level|pg||
nt|ritong: since declarer would exclaim " hey my big gin card"|pg||
nt|h_karluk: http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/    enjoy guys :)|pg||
nt|petergill: It looks like 6@h to me - EW will be unable to identify the singleton club opposite the ace|pg||
pc|s2|nt|szalay: I think to open 7-4 in white is good bridge, regardless of your age|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Now South likes his hand|pg||
nt|szalay: in white/red 4@C is an option, imho|pg||
nt|haans: i think not|pg||
nt|petergill: West too strong to splinter|pg||
pc|s8|nt|h_karluk: could also play for divided @d honours|pg||
nt|h_karluk: seems preferred 3-3 35/6 %|pg||
nt|haans: 4th 5th spade|pg||
nt|hawe45:  That was what I tried to indicate..!|pg||
nt|chick: lucky for declarer, @SJ10 fall|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Still 2 losers|pg||
nt|szalay: likely 500 and 12 imps for Hungary..and: new leader:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: de Pagter wondering out loud whether Hop should've bid 2NT|pg||
nt|szalay: 1@S was: comp values, at most 3@S|pg||
nt|haans: need relay bidding|pg||
nt|petergill: Good point|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|sharkey: we can follow jacco - just finsih the hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: true but the other table played the hand it was supposed to be played|pg||
nt|sharkey: Makes on low @C lead...|pg||
nt|haans: opinion: gronkvist: they must cancel the board gronkvist: will the laws says so|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s7|nt|szalay: u wont punish for light openings cause light overcalls and vica versa|pg||
nt|szalay: why not to take @C in hand?|pg||
nt|szalay: to start @D ruff?|pg||
nt|frankaus: maybe planning on a dummy reversal|pg||
nt|po-s: there is a narrow path perhaps to go down|pg||
nt|haans: still you have @D to K|pg||
nt|h_karluk: needless to say obvious losers there|pg||
nt|han: Declarer will make if he plays safely, but of course he doesn't know the hearts are friendly|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sybarra: he may be thinking same thing,  maybe played too fast |pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: Now they're all saying I'm junior to me :P|pg||
nt|szalay: the tipical terrible "fashion-convention"|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: 1@s showing less than 4 @s's, 8+ hcp|pg||
nt|szalay: it looks 800 now|pg||
nt|daman: they should be hugging each other|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: not in their  blood i think|pg||
nt|marlowepi: making 5|pg||
nt|mcphee: i bet they do not play leb there or there would be no reason to pass 3@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: North gave dbl of 3N a thought|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: I could led the right guy lead but he led small club|pg||
nt|daman: nah  that's true|pg||
nt|h_karluk: he got @h count now, not hard to draw the big picture in his mind, won't be tough defense in his perspective|pg||
nt|ralfwil: response 3@c positive and a 4-card suit. After checkingg aces W can see 13 tricks|pg||
nt|haans: ralf strong argument|pg||
nt|petergill: Or 1@H - 2NT - 3@C balanced extras, to save space, allowing 4@C, 4@D or 3@S by West to show singletons with hand too strong to splinter. Or something like that. |pg||
pc|h4|nt|hawe45:  Then I think, that East had minimum for his 4 @C-bid...!|pg||
nt|xenya: strange line of play|pg||
nt|haans: most in sweden play like that Peter|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hK|nt|vugraphzeg: I love how 3/10 are people I know|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @d K ?? :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: yep|pg||
nt|haans: a spade please|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: they like nice clothes and to yell|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|pelu: the problem are not 13-14 HCP - but the bad suit|pg||
nt|daman: and gelato|pg||
nt|po-s: I wonder if this was a Lebensohl situation for NS - 3C showed some values|pg||
nt|haans: and if you did CHEATING?????|pg||
pc|d3|nt|h_karluk: ok sir, thanks :)|pg||
nt|chick: yes, switch the @S8 and 7, different story|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ady: now K@C and club|pg||
nt|h_karluk: okay, say you entered the score, it helps to see in comparison? |pg||
nt|hawe45:  Not allowed|pg||
nt|po-s: yes but obviously declarer was afraid of getting a diamond played from North|pg||
nt|han: he doesn't need hearts actually|pg||
pc|d9|nt|h_karluk: well, seriously i do not think we can have ideal conditions at all times|pg||
nt|h_karluk: how they say? umm - lesser evil <my review>|pg||
nt|Walddk4: That's what pre-empts are for, but I don't think Edgtton had a serious problem with that hand|pg||
nt|h_karluk: soon east would be endplayed with a careful timing|pg||
nt|haans: opps in the dark|pg||
nt|szalay: the East probably didnt read Rodwell interview:|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think they play auto doubles|pg||
nt|po-s: his alternative would be 3NT|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|szalay: to take trick first and think thereafter isnt a good omen|pg||
nt|han: a club will go on the diamonds|pg||
mc|10|nt|sybarra: why not pitch ht|pg||
nt|sybarra: or is that the exit card?|pg||
nt|daman: East is in trouble |pg||
nt|marlowepi: trump lead will cause N to go right in spades|pg||
nt|han: and declarer only loses 1 diamond, 1 club (at most) and 1 trump|pg||
nt|han: as south would hardly hold 4 spades, this line was 100% safe|pg||

nt|szalay: I think South has INV with @Cs, lets say 3@C is normal or 2N...|pg||
nt|pelu: by West|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Strange, that 6 NT went down - you have 12 tricks with safin the @D-suit and take the losing @H-finesse|pg||
nt|szalay: South is female and 16-years old only|pg||
nt|szalay: 3@D was Rubenshol: @Hs, inv +|pg||
nt|szalay: doubt West wd pass it|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: 3@D Switch, rather|pg||
nt|szalay: switch: dom and sub in one?:)|pg||
nt|szalay: South of course passes|pg||
nt|sybarra: LOL,  it was HOP,  I just followed what was on profile  |pg||
nt|mcphee: i think if N had @H stop they just bid 3N don't you?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i am OK with 1@h|pg||
nt|po-s: Adam shows that pass is never an option|pg||
nt|mcphee: providing 3@C shows somethng|pg||

nt|szalay: its Molenaar's double session|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: west might have explained this as weak with @d|pg||
nt|h_karluk: imho 5@c unbelievable|pg||
nt|haans: 3 down in 5@Cx|pg||
nt|haans: 2|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 2@C is not an overbid|pg||
nt|h_karluk: could any lead a trump from QT - say to 5 clubs contract? :)|pg||
nt|haans: 3@Dx|pg||
nt|szalay: thx all, it was fun, and interesting|pg||
nt|szalay: probably West, her screenmate is trhinking|pg||
nt|szalay: am I right?|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: correct|pg||
nt|szalay: Danke|pg||
nt|rnmalik: absolutely and difficult waters for EW|pg||
nt|szalay: 4@S RKC or rather cue?|pg||
nt|szalay: muddy waters, rather|pg||
nt|sybarra: next match: israel-Neth. blue|pg||
nt|haans: 20 min to next session|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: thats in about 20 min from now.|pg||
nt|sybarra: Our gratitude to the NBB for brining this wonderful tourney to BBO.  |pg||
nt|h_karluk: bye, see you in next match|pg||
nt|haans: easy 4@H|pg||
nt|yuval10: board 26 - EW playing 3NT in the OR, and the lead was.....@c from N|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: possibly 3@s would come|pg||
nt|xenya: http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=85&Itemid=79 for standings after 9 rounds|pg||
nt|haans: we thank you Shirley :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: Our gratitude to the NBB for brining this wonderful tourney to BBO.  |pg||
nt|sybarra: Special thanks to Kees Tammens and Hans van Staveren, and sponsors Max Abram, Herman Drenkelford, Peter Sisselaar and Jos Janssens.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: traditional - bid your suit!|pg||
nt|petergill: Aussies with a recent ex-New Zealander - Michael Whibley has recently moved from New Zealand to Australia |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Do these people know the danger in getting an Aussie and a Kiwi mixed up? Can be fatal...  a spectator points out|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: glad I'm sure Andy won't kill me :)|pg||
nt|haans: mandatory South say|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: I think its going down for @S lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: yikes!!  here we go again|pg||
nt|szalay: 6@C for sure|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: East wasnt passing, I could tell you that|pg||
nt|xenya: E seems to have taken partner's 4@C too seriously|pg||
nt|h_karluk: what would you lead vs 5@c ? @h A/K or @s A+x ? :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: @C|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT the easiest as they lay    but likely to play 5@C  which would certainly go down to a trump lead   4@H can make|pg||
nt|haans: at last|pg||
nt|daman: thanks to th NBB for letting us bring this to you    thanks also to the Sponsors|pg||
nt|sybarra: Special thanks to Kees Tammens and Hans van Staveren, and sponsors Max Abram, Herman Drenkelford, Peter Sisselaar and Jos Janssens.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: bid 7S, get trump lead, double squeeze|pg||
nt|yo_yo: NS got into the bidding in the other room|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i played 4@d different. in my old cc just send here (multi)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our next match will be USA vs Israel|pg||
nt|yo_yo: now this can make|pg||
nt|ralfwil: all 13|pg||
nt|yo_yo: on the fortunate split in @S suit|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes  all the tricks |pg||
nt|h_karluk: 3-1 50%. 2-2 40% (@s) 9 cards |pg||
nt|h_karluk: bye for now, enjoy|pg||
nt|petergill: It's similar to muddling a Dane and a German, or an Irishman and an Englishman|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: Dutch and Belgians ;)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|yuval10: E likes his hand|pg||
nt|haans: game at or|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i do not believe my eyes, 4261 with 6 hcp and 3@d 3rd seat both nonvul :)|pg||
nt|davidb: not a  lucky decision |pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: anyone dare interpret this auction?|pg||
nt|haans: a make (i think) :)|pg||
nt|haans: missed hearts so will we know|pg||
nt|sybarra: Special thanks to Kees Tammens and Hans van Staveren, and sponsors Max Abram, Herman Drenkelford, Peter Sisselaar and Jos Janssens.!|pg||
nt|haans: but no @SQ so no 7|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: the Next match broadcasted will be Australa agains Worldteam (Japan/czech combination)|pg||
nt|sybarra: Thanks also to our specs who give us helpful comments and some humor!|pg||
nt|ritong: not even 6 other room  extremely prudent|pg||
nt|marlowepi: cautious juniors--what is this world coming to?|pg||
nt|haans: :) good one :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E has to cue now|pg||
nt|haans: rkc|pg||
nt|marlowepi: especially if 2S showed six, and/or if not playing 3N vs. cuebid distingishes serious from nonserious slam try|pg||
nt|h_karluk: bye, c u next segment|pg||
nt|mcphee: Adam looking to get some back or give some away:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: Thanks also to our specs who give us helpful comments and some humor!|pg||
nt|othered1: but south's lead was a low @C so ducking first club is simply double-dummy|pg||
nt|haans: what delayed u|pg||
nt|han: I don't know what happened in the other room, it looks like North showed the majors and then bid exclusion blackwood|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: 1st four will qualify for the semifinals, which start tomorrow at 1100 cet|pg||
pc|h2|nt|haans: dbl gazzili like bid?|pg||
nt|ady: not likely to play 4@H|pg||
nt|frankaus: have you heard my view on playing 5 minor contracts?|pg||
nt|ady: managed 3NY OR|pg||
nt|ady: OR|pg||
nt|h_karluk: esp when N showed his interest on unbid suits (the reds)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: sorry there were a huge misjudgement|pg||
nt|sybarra: might we try 3 @C now?|pg||
nt|pelu: ther5e are 8 "top" tricks - but not when u take @cK (see the 10) and run @cJ :(|pg||
nt|ady: must have got club position wrong in OR  to go so badly down in 3NT     low club and when 10 appeared went up with king and finessed 9|pg||
nt|pelu: 0,1 sec late, David :)|pg||
nt|ady: yes    you are too quick for me Peter|pg||
nt|haans: hearts right|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Spades are blocked but still only 8 tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Declarer's best chance is to duck at trick 1|pg||
nt|haans: wai'th with @CA|pg||
nt|haans: 2-2 in red|pg||
nt|haans: ? 18-19 or good @D?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I don´t know when this convention was played in USA, but a team in Gothenbutg playen 2nt  frocing with trumph support already in the early 1950 decade|pg||
nt|han: but something must have gone wrong because they stopped below slam with only 1 keycard out|pg||
pc|d2|nt|szalay: if u travel across the World, better to agree 2suiter overcalls|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: the problem was the semi natural 1@c openingbid i think|pg||
nt|szalay: if a bid (semi)natural, better to treat it as natural, eg. to play (1m)-2m as Michaels vs. prepared 1m yet|pg||
nt|sybarra: likely to misguess hts here also |pg||
nt|h_karluk: obviously - east players happy with that 7 hcp|pg||
nt|yuval10: maybe too much for a 4-3-3-3 hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: 4@S cue|pg||
nt|szalay: I predict -1 and Hungary's win|pg||
nt|yuval10: this is the last board of the 10th round now|pg||
nt|chick: S is likely to get endplayed |pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: declarer didn't play for endplay but just claimed on 2 finesses|pg||
nt|yuval10: you can hardly endplay him|pg||
nt|daman: and thanks to BBO    without them we would not be able to watch this|pg||
nt|tomi2: Tarnovski will think "I dont understand this auction" but he does not care, he is dummy :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: aha 16-8 now|pg||
nt|yuval10: so looks like a hugh swing for France and it is|pg||
nt|yuval10: 15 imps|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|szalay: but grand slam try with missing ace was a mistake, anyway|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: 1430, I guess|pg||
nt|xenya: admittedly, he does have a great hand|pg||
nt|szalay: nbo pressure for N-S now|pg||
nt|szalay: the real issue is 3m is nat or stopper asking|pg||
nt|haans: not to happy with @H lead|pg||
nt|ady: in what   4@H?|pg||
nt|haans: nt|pg||
nt|frankaus: its like kissing your own sister - even when its right ---- its hard to get excited about your prospects|pg||
nt|szalay: any bet?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Good defense now and we have a new leader:)|pg||
nt|szalay: every dutchman says: he will make it|pg||
nt|szalay: btw, this is the last board of set and last set for me|pg||
nt|szalay: thx all your patience, it was funny, anyway|pg||
nt|xenya: no defense, however good, will work if declarer gets @Hs right|pg||
nt|szalay: that is what bet about|pg||
nt|szalay: bt w to play safety @H in good direction is risky:|pg||
nt|szalay: he could lose 2 @Ds and a @H|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hi Vladimir:)|pg||
nt|szalay: so better to play for @H to king and small one, imho|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Rashed:)|pg||
nt|szalay: do u agree?|pg||
nt|xenya: thanks everyone|pg||
nt|po-s: why not|pg||
nt|chick: don't have to, it's automatic|pg||
nt|po-s: why would you need to - in 5H defenders helped a lot|pg||
nt|haans: sry|pg||
nt|sybarra: Thanks also to our specs who give us helpful comments and some humor! |pg||
nt|ralfwil: if 2@c is majors I think S has a great hand after 4@h from N, so 4@s is a nice trial - or?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|hawe45:  Is this result correct from =R - 10 tricks with two @H-losers and 3 potential trump-losers?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  From OR|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But still|pg||
nt|haans: they may still be relaying|pg||
nt|haans: ops|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: Lotan looked at me very disappointed|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if you are going to bid 4S, at least do it in tempo|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Dane and Swede even worse|pg||
nt|yo_yo: off on a @S lead |pg||
nt|yo_yo: but  too difficult from K|pg||
nt|petergill: At least two players of this French team number 2 has won World Junior Championships, in Beijing in 2008|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Gothenburg plaued sry:)|pg||
nt|haans: did not stenberg play it in 50th?|pg||
pc|h8|nt|szalay: time for @S switch yet, and likely 2 off|pg||
nt|szalay: c u in 30 minutes|pg||
nt|szalay: byebye|pg||
nt|pelu: now 25-0 could be 25-24!|pg||
nt|haans: hung is trying to show his strength|pg||
nt|ady: yes Netherlands good comeback|pg||
nt|Walddk4: If he thinks he has that strong a hand, why did he not reverse into 2@H?|pg||
nt|ady: well the 2 club rebid did not exactly convey the hand|pg||
nt|haans: his opinion for a long time|pg||
nt|davidb: to leave the X . 3D  is ok for  juniors openings|pg||
nt|rnmalik: might play small from table to 9-safety play|pg||
nt|ritong: ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: like he bid like an old man|pg||
nt|marlowepi: or someone who was once an old man:)|pg||
nt|ritong: and made his duty|pg||
nt|petergill: 2NT 6+ @D and 3@S, at least invitational|pg||
pc|h3|nt|h_karluk: thanks, you interpreted my feelings :)|pg||
nt|szalay: it will be push, thx all, c u soon|pg||
nt|h_karluk: thx buddy, c ya soon|pg||
nt|szalay: so from 52 cards 5@H is makeable now|pg||
nt|daman: the next session is scheduled for 12 minutes from now|pg||
nt|yo_yo: oh my goodness  can you see the other result on board 6?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and now-1|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes! astonishing with no @s lead!|pg||
nt|haans: we do not know when Jacoby invented it When we was allowed by ACBL to play it|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|haans: once again holy ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: a-ha North pushes his opps to game|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 4@C er helt ude i hampen|pg||
nt|frankaus: may escape  with -2|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: south asking west what double means|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: west doesnt have a real clue|pg||
nt|sybarra: how about "I think we can beat the contract"  as an answer|pg||
nt|Walddk4: And they can|pg||
nt|ritong: there is no reason to bid quickly, since west must pass 4@s no matter what|pg||
nt|haans: not forcing p may pass with Qx in spades|pg||
nt|sybarra: really|pg||
nt|sybarra: ??|pg||
nt|haans: that is my opinion|pg||
nt|othered1: OK,if partner's allowed to  judge, it's normal.  Otherwise forcing pass on first round at 2-level is alertable, isn't it?|pg||
nt|haans: thew stronger spade the less does p have|pg||
nt|haans: he|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@C asks for shortage I think  3@H = singleton @H|pg||
pc|h6|nt|xenya: but S preempted -- that may be a factor|pg||
pc|d6|nt|sharkey: Sac vs 3@H?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: there were a passed hand double and imho showed @h+@d|pg||
nt|pelu: the problem is that the X from = @H, so 2@h is what??|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Maybe that's too simple|pg||
nt|haans: we have said neither|pg||
nt|pelu: so play: X = dont lead @s|pg||
nt|Walddk4: but will they?|pg||
nt|ritong: some would pass, somewhat stupidly, thinking " no double no trouble"|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|xenya: this stands no chance of course -- let's see if he can get out for -1|pg||
nt|ady: high spade likely lead|pg||
nt|pelu: some play after opp has shown 2 suits, that a bid here is sopper and no stopper in the other suit|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hope they make postmortem especially about this board|pg||
nt|sybarra: ht lead spade thru?|pg||
nt|daman: sorry  22 minutes|pg||
nt|mcphee: wow|pg||
nt|Walddk4: All results (including butlers and hand records) at www.nbbportal.nl/1003/ > 'competitie' --> White House Juniors (line 2) --> 13-18|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|Walddk4: sorry for speaking Danish|pg||
nt|h_karluk: makeable now|pg||
nt|haans: small @D????????????????|pg||
nt|ady: win and duck a heart  will make|pg||
nt|ady: I think this may be down 1   so -200  will gain against 400 OR|pg||
nt|sybarra: or now,  of @S, H! switch,  spade thru?|pg||
nt|pelu: in S some play RD = I am not sure we sh play 3Nt and Pass = OK with me|pg||
nt|szalay: I just said: its not the percentage line|pg||
nt|han: in this room it is more understandable to miss slam, it is rare to have slam after a strong notrump opening|pg||
pc|sA|nt|frankaus: bed time here back latter in day european time|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: yes this happened, north couldnt play south for 4@D|pg||
nt|xenya: i doubt that -- W's clubs are too small|pg||
nt|xenya: setting up @Ds would mean seetting up trump tricks for N|pg||
nt|sybarra: cu frank @H |pg||
nt|xenya: but i overlooked the fact that the defence had presented E with a trick -- now he certainly can make 11 and must be thinking how to get 12  |pg||
nt|sybarra: this doesnt look too tricky for declarer |pg||
nt|po-s: spade please|pg||
nt|mcphee: thanks all for watching|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: We'll be back with Netherlands Red - France 2|pg||
nt|petergill: Or perhaps only of this French team won the World Championship|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ady: can establish spades    but has no trump control|pg||
nt|h_karluk: !k was the lead i expected|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @h K|pg||
nt|sharkey: Actually first time the Danes made a "crazy" bid this match I think|pg||
nt|daman: that may not happen     this match is behind|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 9 out of ten game over for Israel when i check the movie, however who knows|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Walddk4: West must switch to a diamond, heart not good enough|pg||
nt|pelu: doubtshowing RD|pg||
nt|rnmalik: new leader:)|pg||
nt|szalay: declarer played it weel after an agressive bidding|pg||
nt|szalay: was unlucky, and Hungary won by 9|pg||
nt|szalay: sry, by 7|pg||
nt|szalay: 17-13 is the final result of the Derby of Calvinists|pg||
nt|szalay: c u soon, gotta go for tourney|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|h_karluk: however their maters scored +620|pg||
nt|haans: all card for opps|pg||
nt|othered1: that sort of implies that the worse their contract, say in terms of total trumps that they hold, the less likely it is that you can double them.  Funny correlation.|pg||
nt|sybarra: that is interesting Ed |pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: director is telling that the next match starts in 5min|pg||
nt|xenya: thanks everyone|pg||
pc|s4|nt|marlowepi: why is that? W is unlimited|pg||
nt|haans: they missed in or 2|pg||
nt|ritong: unlimited, but denied minor controls|pg||
nt|haans: thyey at least got to 5|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|haans: gave up|pg||
nt|haans: do not get that ED if p have spade honor i can not have them|pg||
mc|12|nt|pelu: wow|pg||
nt|pelu: now the @cs|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Well, I did not think I got to mention the Bath Coup|pg||
nt|ady: now possible overtrick|pg||
nt|szalay: but @C is option yet:|pg||
nt|pelu: wrong @C then East nust play @D|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: Lhuisser grabs his head already|pg||
nt|pelu: West|pg||
nt|ady: not that easy to switch to a diamond from west|pg||
nt|pelu: they did in OR|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: well he knows south has 3514...|pg||
nt|szalay: 2 off is 17-13 yet|pg||
nt|han: I don't think south has enough to bid over 4@h Ralf|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: see you tomorrow|pg||
nt|han: the @dQ and @cK are wasted|pg||
nt|han: and again, with west holding a strong notrump|pg||
nt|han: had north made a slam try (for example with a splinter) then south would surely cooperate|pg||
pg||
