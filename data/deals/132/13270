nt|dohicky: Looks like it|pg||
nt|eamongall: i see a score of 3@Hs+4 in another match but same board ...also bizarre|pg||
nt|eamongall: the bidding here is possible but  aggressive and the 1@S opening is strange|pg||
nt|cicus: a brave entry by David, which has been left unpunished|pg||

nt|cicus: good for another X?|pg||
nt|cicus: I don't think so|pg||
nt|lestergold: low level part scores only here i suspect that someone will declare and go negative here|pg||
nt|ritong: par élimination, 1 SA semble etre le seul choix possible|pg||
mb|2D|nt|chick: Hello Everyone :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: without a spade lead/[layed by south it may make|pg||
mb|p|nt|pdjourdain: might declarer read this and drop the king?|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: It looks like 4 clubs, three spades and 1 trick in each other, but not easy timing|pg||
nt|cicus: I think 2@S or even 3 making|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: Murdoch has correctly downvalued his two bacl Qx is|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|barnets: n/s have been playing together for around 40 years|pg||
nt|ritong: ce n est pas l avis de franois stretz|pg||
nt|ritong: francois|pg||
pc|c2|nt|dohicky: :) They had 15 year break at one point|pg||
nt|jackthelad: stunningly beautiful Edinburgh|pg||
nt|barnets: probably one of the longest running partnerships in bridge|pg||
nt|barnets: ok|pg||
nt|barnets: i played against them as juniors|pg||
nt|lestergold: black doubleton qs neither of which are pulling their weight|pg||
pc|c7|nt|lestergold: yes i was expecting a further effort fromN/S but they are ta ufavouravle and south's hand was rightly devalued|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|sK|nt|cicus: good decisions by all|pg||
pc|sA|nt|pdjourdain: West switches a heart and then the hearts run, so declarer needed to play club ace at trick one|pg||
nt|qwikjanz: ducking this will ensure contract makes|pg||
pc|s6|nt|pdjourdain: Well done Pat Shields|pg||
pc|s8|pg||

nt|dohicky: taken|pg||
nt|qwikjanz: Interesting hansd - right play in spades is somewhat dependant on how aggressive a multi is played|pg||
nt|dohicky: A fairly heavy defeat about 30-40 imps|pg||
nt|lestergold: opps couldnt get at their 4 tricks single dummy|pg||
nt|santyclz: Well timed|pg||
nt|doctorone: Bonjour a tous|pg||
nt|ritong: hey bachar:)|pg||
nt|doctorone: Henri :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: 3N makes 9 top tricks wikth the clubs breaking|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|3D|nt|barnets: so england are now in the lead ?|pg||
nt|dohicky: I would guess so, i don't know the other scores and the website hasn't been updated|pg||
nt|lestergold: but with a combined 23 game not that likely to be bid 5@d might run into difficulties with spades 4/2|pg||
nt|lestergold: will Greenwood back in here no!|pg||
nt|sheila a: EW look to be able to make game here, possibly|pg||
nt|santyclz: But still an opening for NIBU.|pg||
mb|p|nt|dohicky: it wasnt a multi :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: mind you 4@s loses 2@s and a club|pg||
nt|cicus: strange that E is not bidding his spades|pg||
nt|lestergold: east can show both suits like this|pg||
nt|cicus: spade length is concealed or strength overvalued later|pg||
nt|lestergold: was not a 3@d overfcall avaiolabkle to west|pg||
mb|4S|nt|pdjourdain: another Multi and N must bid his void!|pg||
nt|qwikjanz: N sitting there hoping opps will bid :)|pg||
nt|dohicky: I'm told by the cbai president that it was a 24 imp loss for 19/11|pg||
nt|chick: NS play a weak NT system, as you can see|pg||
nt|ritong: 3@d a l américaine|pg||
mb|p|nt|sheila a: W was obviously put off by the vulnerability|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: 4@h cold this may be expensve|pg||
nt|sheila a: Hoped that partner would be short in @c and able to re-open|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: but it may well go in accordance with their agreements|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3N also cold as south can establish but not menjpy his clubs|pg||
pc|dT|nt|pdjourdain: Declarer should scramble 8 or 9 tricks|pg||
nt|doctorone: 3@d montre probablement une invitation a la manche avec 3 atouts sans singleton|pg||
pc|d3|nt|sheila a: a @s lead causes more problems|pg||
pc|d2|nt|barnets: the x  for the lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: his hand in my opinion is too good to put that amolunt of pressure on his partner at unfaviourable|pg||
nt|lestergold: i predict this will cost them a lot of imps|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|lestergold: well west has chanced game and they will egt an excellent result for their optimism|pg||
nt|cicus: not a particularly good game as both minors should break|pg||
nt|lestergold: west knows hia Ks in partner's two suits are working well however his er club stop four to the eight is perhaps not that robust|pg||
nt|cicus: by choosing X as his first call, E has practically endplayed his side into game|pg||
nt|lestergold: very robust wehn opps cl;ubs are breaking tho 4/4|pg||
nt|lestergold: i like that ides of being ebdplayed into game!!|pg||
nt|cicus: game is about 25 %|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4@s tho was much sounder as it makes even when clubs do not break as long as dims break and spades no worse than 4/2|pg||
nt|cicus: you need 38 % for vul games so it is not that poor|pg||
nt|santyclz: Nice distribution.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|pdjourdain: He can ruff all three spades|pg||
nt|barnets: i think it takes a club lead to beat 6@S|pg||
nt|dohicky: England beat NI 25/5|pg||
nt|barnets: interesting play in 6|pg||
nt|dohicky: yes|pg||
nt|lestergold: I think west should have bid4@s if he was going to bid game|pg||
pc|c2|nt|barnets: so here|pg||
nt|barnets: when dec leads a heart|pg||
nt|barnets: east can win and play another club|pg||
nt|lestergold: i mean how silly do you look when they cash first 5 clubs?|pg||
nt|cicus: I would look rater silly for my partners|pg||

mb|p|nt|lestergold: 3n no play|pg||
mb|1H|nt|lestergold: coffee break hand|pg||
nt|sheila a: N's hand isn't ideal for NT but it seems the pragmatic choice|pg||
nt|lestergold: normal effort id say|pg||
nt|lestergold: but e/w will play spade part socre i expect|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|cicus: light but normal X by E|pg||
nt|lestergold: n/s play game in  hearts only losing a couple of trump tricks|pg||
nt|santyclz: 1nt in 4th seat?|pg||
mb|p|nt|pdjourdain: Likely 1NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2@c some kind of lebensohl?|pg||
nt|chick: EW play a strong 1@C with 1@D negative|pg||
nt|simonr: An amorphous Precison 1@D|pg||
mb|2D|nt|dohicky: Making 3NT looks quite possibly given the @s position|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: but this is OK|pg||
nt|barnets: anyway 8 to ireland on board 1|pg||
nt|lestergold: obviously diamond bid shoing hearts and values|pg||
nt|cicus: transfers have become very popular after intervention - even without|pg||
nt|simonr: They play a strong NT |pg||
mb|p|nt|pdjourdain: East should bid 1S in case West has both majors|pg||
nt|dohicky: West would have opened 2@c with both majors so that isn't really possible|pg||
nt|ritong: 2 ou 3 @ds?|pg||
mb|2N|nt|lestergold: oh maybe this is not a coffee hand after all maybe the coffee wil get spilt|pg||
nt|lestergold: north will now like his hand its very slammish|pg||
nt|lestergold: i have a suit to bid but my hand not good enuf to try for a game|pg||
nt|chick: unfortunately, when opener has diamonds, the strong hand is revealed as dummy, making the defense much easier|pg||
nt|doctorone: 3@d venait bien, je crois|pg||
nt|ritong: 3@d montrerait un 5+/5+ de manche  levy estime que ses couleurs sont un peu creuses, sans doute|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: perhaps|pg||
nt|simonr: @D lead and club switch unlikely|pg||
nt|santyclz: I sometimes open 14 high 1nt's in 4th when no 4-card major.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|lestergold: im nio expert on their system|pg||
nt|simonr: but spades are not carrying their full weight. AQJx is better|pg||
nt|santyclz: Try to keep the opps out.|pg||
mb|p|nt|dohicky: at least 4/4|pg||
nt|barnets: declarer is worried about losing 4@C tricks and a @D|pg||
nt|barnets: but that is not going to happen|pg||
nt|simonr: Safe neutral lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sheila a: I guess W could have said something else to indicate a different hand type (ie if he was stronger)|pg||
nt|lestergold: suggested that it is capelleti|pg||
nt|lestergold: single msuiter basically|pg||
pc|dT|nt|pdjourdain: interesting whether oppo know East would not show spades|pg||
nt|barnets: today anyway :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: south should sign off now knwoing that his great dim vaslues buy a singlteon opposite and his hearts arec not that great|pg||
nt|cicus: N would have done better splintering with 4@Ds|pg||
nt|cicus: if it does not show a void in their methods|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes but effectively he did at the 5 level but partner soldiered on into the valley of death|pg||
nt|lestergold: charge of the l;ight brigade the hearts being rather light|pg||

mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|pdjourdain: Strong club 1@D|pg||

nt|chick: I would expect EW to find 3N after the strong club opening|pg||
mb|d|mb|2S|nt|ritong: ?|pg||
mb|4D|nt|sheila a: there is debate as to whether you should play penalty doubles over a strong NT|pg||
nt|sheila a: if you don't it can be hard to let partner know you have a really good hand|pg||
nt|simonr: Straight forward auction to 3NT and should be a simple make|pg||
nt|ritong: ah:)|pg||
nt|doctorone: c mieux :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|pdjourdain: dble shows 3 hearts|pg||
nt|eamongall: looks like one off to me in 4@S |pg||
nt|dohicky: yes|pg||
nt|cicus: another coffee?|pg||
nt|chick: should make on any lead, with 5 clubs and 4 diamonds|pg||
mb|4H|nt|lestergold: n/s vulnerable so dangerous  now for south to re neter but he has|pg||
nt|santyclz: Time to get a refill of your favorite beverage here.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|pdjourdain: should just make|pg||
nt|dohicky: I wonder would NS have found 4@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: this was vey well done n/s|pg||
nt|barnets: to scor their plus|pg||
nt|barnets: and reach the par contract|pg||
nt|barnets: it was tempting for both north and south to take different actions|pg||
nt|lestergold: lucky to find his partner with spades and a few meagre values if east had this instead he could be walking into penalty territory|pg||
nt|simonr: Too early for that - not yet dark here is Wales|pg||
nt|santyclz: It's Sunday, noon is late enough.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lestergold: well he has done a lot of bidding ion his 16 count and bad spades|pg||

mb|p|nt|simonr: 1@S from South - will North show a forcing NT or consider the hand too good for that|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: both major games playable here|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5@c e/w or even 4@s makes|pg||
mb|1D|nt|pdjourdain: both 3N and 4S OK|pg||
nt|dohicky: Do they not play a 14-16 NT?|pg||
nt|sheila a: Walker keen to get the majors in if possible|pg||
nt|chick: E has a light opening, but with both majors, is definitely worth bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: west may x 2@H|pg||
mb|1N|nt|lestergold: heart save could be too expensive ev en at these colours|pg||
nt|doctorone: contre maintenant?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: e/w 4 of either major 6@h if the heartq is guessed - unlikely|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh|pg||
nt|lestergold: greenwood doing the club jumping that seems saner|pg||
nt|chick: unfortunately, I don't have the convention card for EW, so not sure what 1@S shows (in addition to spades)|pg||
nt|ritong: intéressant|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: that makes moire sense|pg||
nt|simonr: Conservative by North but then playing strong club you do open a lot of 10 counts|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: e/w can make 5@C|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/w close to slam only clubs lie wrong for it|pg||
nt|sheila a: I think we've got a pass missing|pg||
nt|lestergold: r/s doing a good job of muddying the waters|pg||
nt|sheila a: presumably pass from S, 1@s from W|pg||
pc|h4|nt|barnets: it is not a bad contract with all the cards marked in south|pg||
nt|sheila a: East's pass would be forcing in this situation|pg||
pc|h3|nt|pdjourdain: +530 was on Board 15 to be scored later|pg||
nt|dohicky: 5@c looks like it might just scrape home too|pg||

nt|santyclz: But the patient died.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lestergold: can either establish spade or more simply ruff one dim in dummy and just lose a spade and a trump|pg||
nt|cicus: sure, after a @D ruff normal play is @H|pg||

nt|cicus: @HA|pg||

nt|pdjourdain: difficult hand to bid here|pg||
nt|simonr: 4@h by E/W looks the spot - may not get there though|pg||
mb|p|nt|pdjourdain: The singleton 9 of spades helps declarer in 4S|pg||
nt|eamongall: maybe 3@Ds can slip thru via @H ruff|pg||
nt|barnets: Scotland overbid the last board to 4@H with no values and are playing it xd|pg||
nt|lestergold: the eight card major fit is off due to the bad heart break but 4@s is cold|pg||
mb|2C|nt|chick: another not-so-nice fitting hand|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: strong club|pg||
mb|p|nt|simonr: Weak NT - what transfer breaks do they play? And will West accept?|pg||
nt|ritong: tout ça va finir a 3SA, l entame risque d etre difficile|pg||

mb|2D|nt|eamongall: hard for Brian Short to stop at 2N|pg||

nt|Walddk5: You are invisible|pg||
mb|p|nt|dohicky: With both AQs offside 3@h looks to be -1 |pg||

nt|eamongall: I don't think it will be more David if at all|pg||
nt|dohicky:  you might be able to get a an extra @C and @d eventually|pg||
nt|eamongall: but opps will be at least 6 tricks by then |pg||
nt|vugraphzdv: declarer looking at a,9@s and QJ5 @h in dummy|pg||

nt|cicus: whatever the range|pg||
nt|sheila a: that's rare |pg||
nt|pdjourdain: Normal 3N|pg||
nt|simonr: Good @s slam here|pg||
nt|doctorone: Hi PO.... :)|pg||
nt|ritong: PO in great shape this morning|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: some think that failing to oepn balanced hands in the no trump range with  NO TRUMP MAKES THE BIDDING AWKAWD LATER ITS OFTEN DEBATED IN THE BRIDGE MAGS|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|vugraphzdv: will put in scores in other room at end|pg||
mb|1S|nt|lestergold: PERSONALLY IM IN FAVOUR OF OPENING ALL BALANCED HANDS WITHIN THE RABNGE WITH A NO TRUMP ALTHO I ACCEPT THE OCCASIONAL DOWNSIDE|pg||
mb|3D|nt|dohicky: Seems like an easy enough 4@s|pg||
nt|eamongall: seems to be about enough to assemble a 3NT contract for NS |pg||
nt|eamongall: 4@S will do also and maybe safer |pg||
nt|lestergold: caps lock agin sorry|pg||
nt|cicus: however I dislike opening 1NT with 5cM, I have to admit that it works most of the time|pg||
nt|lestergold: I think instinctively we all dislike having to open a no trump with taght sort of hand i think it is a matter of partnership style and preference|pg||
nt|sheila a: 4@s makes here when the @d come in|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: 14-16 NT in 4th seat this is too strong|pg||
nt|ritong: 3@s semble juste|pg||
nt|ritong: mais plus maintenant|pg||
nt|ritong: a mon avis nord a dit 4@s et est regarde tout ça|pg||
mb|4S|mb|5D|nt|eamongall: but I see quick routes to 9 tricks in 3NT |pg||
nt|eamongall: however as David says ...4@S is a place to play|pg||
nt|chick: NS play a weak 12-14 NT in all but 3rd seat according to their cc, do you know otherwise?|pg||
nt|ritong: et décide de mouiller le maillot|pg||
nt|ritong: sous une forme surprenante|pg||
nt|ritong: 5@c venait bien|pg||
mb|5S|nt|eamongall: the scots getting a little high now |pg||
nt|lestergold: well now we have a no trump openiong with a 4225 which is not a balnced hand in my opionion|pg||
nt|lestergold: the double fit may encourage game to be bid same ten tricks in the spade 5/2 fit as the dim 5/4 fit tho|pg||
nt|simonr: Support raise - not sure if forcing to 3@S or game in their system|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: perhaps E's opening will keep NS from bidding 6|pg||
nt|ritong: apres avoir passé initialement|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dohicky: Could be tough to stay out of slam now|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: Drury response but it doesn't have 3@H?|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: Sorry, when I partner Gary he has to play 14-16 in fourth as well!|pg||
nt|simonr: 3@c is min or max with short clubs|pg||
nt|doctorone: 5@s parait clair au nom de la distribution et du complement a @h|pg||
pc|dA|nt|pdjourdain: Most now bid 2S rather than 2C though not the French!|pg||
nt|eamongall: no major pitfalls when the long trump chap has 4333|pg||
nt|eamongall: and the lead scoops out the @DK location |pg||
nt|eamongall: although bidding had told most of the story|pg||
pc|d2|nt|xenya: well if they bid it, they will likely make it |pg||
nt|xenya: declared by S|pg||
nt|dohicky: Yes a @s lead seems unlikely|pg||
nt|eamongall: oops missed the @DT ...4@Ds is makable |pg||
nt|eamongall: thanks rafal|pg||
nt|dohicky:  Yes you can discard a @s or @c on a @H|pg||
nt|santyclz: Is s relaying?|pg||
pc|d5|nt|pdjourdain: No, can't be Drury with weak NT|pg||
nt|simonr: Not sure - possibly cue bidding now|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|cicus: it would never occur to me to open this one 1NT|pg||
pc|dK|nt|lestergold: maybe anderson is just a no trump hideous hog|pg||
nt|sheila a: I have to leave you, now. Have fun for the rest of the match!|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d7|nt|lestergold: well a missed opportunity but cant accuse them of underbidding maybe Greenwood should have raised the second bid to 3@d |pg||
nt|chick: in any case, they are in the right spot|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s4|nt|simonr: RCKB - two aces + Q of trumps|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lestergold: seems more natural to do so to me|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|s6|nt|lestergold: nor me it is clearly a club opener unless you have systematic problems and play a club system where clubs dont mean lubs|pg||
pc|s8|nt|dohicky: All the luck in the world for NS here :)|pg||
nt|cicus: I do play a club system where this hand is opened 1@D|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sT|pg||
nt|santyclz: Nice 26hcp slam.|pg||
nt|simonr: Saved the overtrick!|pg||
nt|simonr: ... but playing with a 30 point deck. Nothing wasted in @C|pg||
nt|santyclz: Power of the double fit.|pg||
nt|simonr: Denning knew all his points were working|pg||
pc|hK|nt|qwikjanz: and that style of bidding makes it harder to duck the @S|pg||
nt|cicus: also has drawbacks sometimes but I haven't yet experienced those one|pg||

nt|santyclz: Midnight swiss preempt.|pg||
mb|1S|nt|barnets: e/w do well in clubs|pg||

nt|barnets: maybe 2 tricks on a spade lead|pg||

nt|eamongall: @Sa|pg||
nt|cicus: on 7 Scotland did open 1NT but still arrived at 4@H|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: Yes i would open 1@H on north|pg||
nt|doctorone: voyons ce qu'en dit Paul |pg||
mb|2C|nt|chick: typically the X shows the ability to double one of the opp's suits|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: until he goes several off!!!|pg||
nt|doctorone: 2@c peut eter|pg||
mb|3D|nt|pdjourdain: 2N for the minor|pg||
mb|p|nt|qwikjanz: bd 6 wales played 3N and scores are tied :)|pg||
nt|xenya: perhaps was a little better to start with a small @D from dummy but it's neither here nor there|pg||
nt|barnets: need to lead a @D to stop 5|pg||
nt|dohicky:  you have an extra pass Sandie|pg||
nt|eamongall: 12 in @Ss|pg||
mb|3S|nt|dohicky: A spec points out on a @s lead W needs to keep the 9@c to save E from being squeezed|pg||
nt|eamongall: well theres the @Cs into the auction for Ew|pg||
nt|eamongall: might even get 12 tricks in @Sa|pg||
nt|cicus: it was a triumph for David Greenwood suppressing his 5th heart|pg||
nt|lestergold: well NI seem to be getting the better of scotland but there is a fair amount of luck goin with them too|pg||
nt|lestergold: this shoudl be a straightforward 4@s good contract|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: Ah, correction from operator|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|xenya: yes, true|pg||
mb|p|nt|dohicky:  as long as you can find the queen|pg||

nt|pdjourdain: I didn't realise spades was a minor suit:)|pg||
nt|chick: just for today :)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|eamongall: and some @Hs too ...this double has multi functions|pg||
nt|barnets: now 5@C|pg||
nt|eamongall: vulnerability will not stop Walker ..|pg||
nt|eamongall: at least I typed before auction ended|pg||
nt|cicus: all my Drury sequences follow this course|pg||
nt|doctorone: A et R de @c a l'entame clarifieront la place des heonneurs manquants|pg||

pc|c7|pc|c3|nt|pdjourdain: And Wales has the best of Boards 15 and 16|pg||
nt|lestergold: note that even with both finesses wrong and a heart lead a ht discarder on club and third heart ruffed in dummy would make the contract|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|eamongall: bugger ..Mesbur for once bid quicker then I type |pg||
nt|ritong: 3@d est une légère distorsion, ça correspond plus a cinq @ds et 4 @ss|pg||

pc|s9|nt|eamongall: Normally I will by 1 minute |pg||
nt|eamongall: I win ..|pg||
nt|barnets: so we dont get to see if n/s would find th lead to beat 6@C|pg||
nt|eamongall: one off ...is not bad if one is not finding the @D lead |pg||
nt|lestergold: and may well followm this line as a precaution in any case|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: Surely South doubled this too|pg||
nt|ritong: et françois pourrait regretter son pessimisme|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sT|nt|lestergold: looks like it|pg||
nt|chick: only down 2, but a disaster Vul|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||

nt|dohicky:  Probably just 10 tricks now |pg||
pc|h5|pc|h6|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: Matches are 32 boards before VPing|pg||
nt|barnets: i doubt it|pg||
nt|chick: assuming doubled|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ritong: il n avait pas de complément a @d, en revanche le dixième atout présumé etait joli|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|pdjourdain: Assuming south doubled the final contract the auction makes sense now|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h2|pg||
nt|chick: I would certainly pass the 2@S bid after S's original double -- why risk disaster?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|dohicky:  or maybe not|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|s5|pc|h9|pg||
nt|eamongall: me too ...|pg||
nt|chick: partner chose spades, that's all I would need to know|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: Might scramble 7 tricks|pg||
nt|chick: the missed 4@S on bd 6 cost them 11 imps|pg||
pc|dA|nt|barnets: in other room e/w did not bid|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|barnets: so this is the first swing to scotland of any size|pg||
pc|d5|nt|dohicky: 12 tricks now|pg||
nt|lestergold: and make overtrickas spade fimnesse is right|pg||
nt|chick: it's possible he is trying to make that back|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|pc|s3|pc|d6|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: By losing more?|pg||
nt|chick: yep, I have never understood swinging, but it happens|pg||
nt|chick: he might actually make this contract |pg||
pc|h8|nt|lestergold: so roland would be in slam as its better than 12.85%|pg||
nt|cicus: what if S now leads a heart and promotes N's K9x?|pg||
nt|cicus: (not on this hand of course)|pg||
nt|lestergold: well it would be a great defence in that situation and teach declarwer a lesson for being breedy for overtricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: greedy|pg||

mb|p|nt|barnets: 11 imps to scotland|pg||

pc|s6|nt|chick: past the point of no return and playing in a 4-2 fit|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: Presumably East thought 2@C was checkback and West thought it natural|pg||
pc|h6|nt|lestergold: altho the final contract doubled is within the realms of what we see regularly in these matches|pg||
nt|pdjourdain: Alternatively the bididng needs correcting|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|xenya: all quite reasonable i think --  9 tricks|pg||

nt|eamongall: I read all the hands ...now I am reading the stories |pg||
nt|dohicky: interesting|pg||
nt|eamongall: for results etc ...start at www.nibu.co.uk and navigate to Bangor Bridge Congress page |pg||
nt|vugraphzdv: Hands seem to be transposed?|pg||
nt|lestergold: when you see both hands of course 3n is a better contract but unbiddable compared with the obvious 4@h|pg||
nt|vugraphzdv: Lead Jc|pg||
nt|lestergold: then certainly transposed|pg||
nt|lestergold: unless Liz u are already on the l.ocal tipple|pg||
nt|ritong: correct|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: undo ope|pg||

nt|vugraphzdv: It appears so.  |pg||

nt|ritong: rejeté|pg||
mb|3S|nt|xenya: but still should make|pg||
nt|dohicky: yes if S ducks a @c finesse after drawing trumps|pg||
nt|dohicky:  2N is probably some form of limit raise in @s|pg||
nt|lestergold: not a bad contract even with spaxdes breaking 4/2 plenty of chance of making as u cab uff a spade high if necessary|pg||
mb|p|nt|dohicky: Missing slam here could be costly|pg||
mb|p|nt|dohicky: well with a @d lead it was down|pg||
nt|dohicky: well no it wouldnt :)|pg||
nt|xenya: i don't think so|pg||
nt|xenya: on a @H lead declarer can work on @Ds making 10 eventually|pg||
nt|dohicky: Another possible 6@h|pg||
nt|lestergold: obviously hand breaks down if both key suits break badly but thats against the odds|pg||
nt|lestergold: i will be surprised if they reach slam of course the lack of wasted in clubs is the reason for the playabkle slam here|pg||
nt|ritong: rien nulle part|pg||
mb|p|nt|dohicky:  maybe a more balanced version than 2@c|pg||
nt|lestergold: can they identify the fact that they are playibng with a thirty point pack in effect and they hold 27 of those 30 points!|pg||
nt|lestergold: its an aold and familiar story|pg||
nt|lestergold: Short will know his hand is great if south can be relied on for a stiff/void club|pg||

nt|doctorone: rejete et un peu haut deja :)|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|eamongall: England 139 Ireland 126 Scotland 114 I think is the current top 3 after 7 matches |pg||

pc|d2|nt|cicus: so it was West who opened 1NT and E transferred|pg||
nt|vugraphzdv: I don't think it's their fault - misdealt by me I think?|pg||

nt|lestergold: spec points out that there are squeeze p;osibilities in 6H but it involves ruffing down the diamonds so west has rto guard both minors etc etc|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: but did N really pass over 1N?|pg||
nt|dohicky: another pass missed?|pg||
nt|cicus: 10 tricks expected here with 1@S+3@H+2@D+4@C|pg||
nt|lestergold: this hand is aclassic hand of playing in the 4/4 fit to use the long suit fit for discards|pg||
mb|4S|nt|chick: I like the 4@H bid, knowing partner has at least 2|pg||
mb|p|nt|pdjourdain: Shields was planning a penalty pass of 2D so must bid 4H now|pg||
nt|xenya: seems unlikely|pg||
nt|dohicky: well he has 2@s as 5@s and a minor|pg||
nt|lestergold: not always correct as sometimes you need to play in the long suit for reasons of control|pg||
mb|p|nt|qwikjanz: so this should catapult wales into the lead|pg||
nt|dohicky: I suppose this bidding makes some sense (except for N first pass)|pg||
mb|p|pc|h2|pc|h4|nt|lestergold: south has the club guard so has to bid it maybe is worried about trump quality presumably can enquire about that?|pg||

pc|s3|pc|h8|pg||

nt|garnetts: haven't analysed the position if defence keeps playing on spades --but I think the 8@C in dummy is crucial |pg||

nt|cicus: if S has the ace he will go up anyway to lead a 3rd @H so declarer may place the ace behind the king|pg||

nt|ady: and east's double?|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dK|pc|d6|pc|d2|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sJ|nt|dburn: 2@c may have been a kind of makeshift Drury, treating @hQJ doubleton as three-card support|pg||

pc|s8|pc|s6|nt|ady: kib says east's doublle take-out of hearts   seems rather thin when the bidding has been cautious prior |pg||

pc|c2|pc|sT|pg||
pc|hT|pc|c3|pc|c4|pc|h5|pg||

pc|h6|pc|dT|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|dburn: and West could always have bid 3@c later, if that was what he wanted to do|pg||
