nt|dagold: so many acol auctions like that. 1nt all pass in 1 room and the other room takes several bids to reach a 4-3 fit at the 3-level|pg||
nt|rmb1: Although this is the last board in this room there are some interesting comparisons to come from closed room on 10-12|pg||
nt|dagold: that is why I think acol is unplayable|pg||
nt|lestergold: exactly 15 count with 4 card suit only looking for trouble id say|pg||
