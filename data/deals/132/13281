mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hT|nt|cuttysark: A fast auction to the normal spot: South rebids her spades to show at least 5, North denies support|pg||

mb|1N|mb|2S|nt|garnetts: true but there was a more obvious end play |pg||

mb|p|nt|garnetts: not enamoured with the 2@C overcall prefer 1NT |pg||

nt|h_karluk: Hi all|pg||
nt|henryb:  E-W can make game, but only game in either red suit. I agree with Canonne that West is worth a reverse, but it may be hard to keep Clement from overreaching to slam|pg||
nt|sharkey: hi Hamdi|pg||
nt|sharkey: W forced to bid 3 NT now?|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: a bit of a coffee hand now---maybe a lot of players would double 2@H with the East hand--I would have risked 2@S |pg||
mb|p|pc|cQ|nt|sharkey: After West's reverse 3@S must be forcing....|pg||
nt|sharkey: sry - East's 3@S|pg||
nt|henryb:  Clement obviously thought 3@s was forcing. Canonne thought she had done enough opposite a misfit|pg||

nt|sharkey: @C and more @C will doom declarer|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s4|pc|h5|nt|cuttysark: Clear to compete in 4th seat - not so clear in the middle of a live auction when South could still be very strong|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c7|pc|c5|pc|c6|pg||
pc|c3|pc|s6|pc|c8|nt|henryb:  she after all has three diamonds for her partner's six card suit and @hAx for the five card suit|pg||
nt|h_karluk: there are two forms of reverse, normal and high, counting eleven in red suits with a minimum that's not close any of that. 2@d could be more reasonable rebid.|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s9|pc|d5|pc|s2|pg||

nt|cuttysark: I guess there may be more action at the other table...|pg||
nt|ady: e/w should end in 4@H|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think that one should open 1@d, and that partner should make allowances for a high card stretch when opener shows 5-6|pg||

mb|p|nt|sharkey: set 4@H|pg||

mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|ady: play should be quick|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 2NT opener - possibly upgraded to 20 because of the good suit - makes it very easy to reach the easy game|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sharkey: East on lead - @S lead not too attarctive...|pg||
nt|henryb:  At the other table East chpse to lead a club against 4@h and one of the spade losers was quickly thrown away|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d3|nt|sharkey: Some may have raised on West's cards to ensure @S lead....|pg||

nt|h_karluk: thanks to our operator, kibbers and fellow commentators|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: The fact that you have 15 points opposite a 2@C opner usually means a grand but to their credit NS made it really hard in the CR--in the open room East could hace used RKCB |pg||
