nt|Walddk2: Så 11 IMPs to PO & JB GOOD|pg||
nt|h_karluk: sorry, in my book one of them should have to worry about his bid being inadequate|pg||
mb|1D|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|geot: Tough 3NT reached in the CR|pg||

mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|geot: Good rescue by North|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sT|nt|h_karluk: I think that when the opponents overcall, you should stretch your system rules to permit your side to stop easily when necessary. There are two reasons for this :|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 1-When the opponents overcall, your side loses one of it weapons 2- Also fewer opportunities for safe bidding|pg||
pc|s4|nt|geot: Good bid by Peo |pg||

nt|viren169: North might have tried a redble (sos) to locate a 4-4 heart fit if it existed|pg||
nt|viren169: You can always bid spades over 2@D|pg||
pc|d5|pc|s5|pc|c4|nt|geot: And how do you know he has 4 hearts when he pull out in 2H?|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And what do you do with the North hand if he bids 2@H and gets doubled? 2@D should be natural imo|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@H does not promise four|pg||
pc|dK|pc|c6|nt|geot: You wont risk playing in 2H on a 4-3 with those spades|pg||
pc|h4|pc|s2|pg||
nt|geot: ok....Roland, we have made our point:)|pg||

mb|2S|nt|Walddk2: Interesting how N-S in the other room avoided their 6-4 spade fit|pg||
nt|baardolav: an orginally 3nt from CR... |pg||

nt|h_karluk: maybe won't have a good way to express|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|geot: In CR, maybe 2NT (8-11 as many play it in Norway), 2NT inquiry - 3NT (balanced)...and he gambled 9 tricks was easier to get than 10|pg||
nt|viren169: looks like no shortage|pg||
nt|geot: or like this:)|pg||
nt|geot: I think 3S shows minimum and no shortage|pg||
pc|d6|nt|h_karluk: I feel embarrassed to offer this hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why is it that North thinks 3NT is better with Jxx in diamonds?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 9 tricks also after a @d lead and a @s  finess|pg||

pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s8|pg||
nt|viren169: N is probably worried about game values and thinks 9 tricks will be easier than 10 |pg||
nt|h_karluk: what i will say definitely is that whatever solution you choose with such trump fits hand it should be used consistently|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c2|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dJ|pc|dK|pc|h6|pg||

mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|viren169: Now I suspect N/S will find 4@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: 4@h seems resonable on NS The only problem is to find @sQ|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 1@c forcing for the moment !|pg||
nt|viren169: or maybe not!|pg||
pc|s4|nt|geot: South has a passed partner Gad|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Passing 1@H shows 3 where I come from|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and here also|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's a mandatory raise with 4 imo|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s6|pc|sT|pg||
nt|viren169: Passing is just wrong where I come from!|pg||
nt|h_karluk: a must|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|pc|h9|nt|geot: Agree Roland, normally you should raise with 4 even with minimum|pg||
nt|ralfwil: One of my pronciples! don´t deny a 4-card trumph support|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|baardolav: Norwegians open light, so 2h is kind of inviting bid 13-14. A game is unlikely from souths hand|pg||
nt|h_karluk: moreover invited a probable @s or NT competition at 1 level|pg||
nt|geot: But according to that, can North do more than an invite (as long as S can be minimum)?|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c2|pc|c5|pc|c4|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c6|nt|ralfwil: also with minimum. many times we can have a perfect adaption|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|viren169: N had just an ordinary 10 count|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That's not the point. By getting support North's hand could improve considerably and he may be able to bid game himself|pg||
nt|viren169: but could have had a shapely 10 count|pg||
pc|dQ|mc|10|nt|h_karluk: to me pass even was  not a personal preference to look for delayed competition|pg||
nt|geot: And tover an invite South has no reason to go to game. We cant say that South should always raise to 2, and that N should go to game when pd may have 12 and 3-4-3-3 (or 11)|pg||
pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|geot: but as Gad says, North may have 5-5 or something, thats why South should raise to 2|pg||
mb|1N|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|viren169: N will probably invite here and South can decline|pg||
nt|viren169: S has no reason to mastermind the auction so soon...|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ralfwil: A big point is if 2@h is a 4-card support, Norths hand is almost an opening|pg||

pc|dK|pc|d9|pc|d7|pc|dT|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|h_karluk: could be an adjustment,  2@c likely was for M|pg||
nt|geot: Good defence. On a low diamond from South in trick 3, I think Sundelin would have ditched a club|pg||
pc|h8|nt|geot: 2@H is a healthy contract, and he will win it|pg||
nt|h_karluk: this family of bids can be made on as few as ten or eleven high card points|pg||
pc|s3|pc|d6|pg||
nt|geot: Difficult to set 3NT though|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Not that you should try it on just any passed eleven hand|pg||
