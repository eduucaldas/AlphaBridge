nt|Walddk2: 1@C is either natural or a 15-19 NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Transfer responses|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1NT 12-14 in all positions|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The ladies play std 5-card majors with a weak NT|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This is the sort of board,where declarer will start thinking, when he sees @s-suit is 4-0|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|odysseus69: start with a near slam- doomed if they stagger into 6 hearts-clubs good for E_W|pg||
mb|p!|nt|Walddk2: Good morning to Ole Berg, our Nusine expert|pg||
mb|4S|nt|jni33: 2@s = 7-11 with 3@s|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|odysseus69: no heroics from West so far|pg||
nt|hawe45:  In fact, withoutr a @d-lead, 6 @S is very good|pg||
nt|oleberg: Thx Roland, but "some insight into Nusine" would be more appropriate :)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: but unlucky|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Yes - and not easy to bid either|pg||
nt|odysseus69: west coming|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Too early in the morning I suppose|pg||

nt|jni33: The scores after yesterdays two sections: http://www.bridge.dk/4554/Klub1/Turneringer/Resultat636.html|pg||
nt|odysseus69: intimidated by male oppo??|pg||
pc|d2|nt|oleberg: Definitely NO, but maybe intimidated by their strength|pg||
nt|odysseus69: been asked why Wests first pass alerted - |pg||
pc|d3|nt|jni33: This is the fifth segment -- and we are all looking forward to the last segment -- then we will have the match between the two "Open Team" pairs -- but thats later in the afternoon|pg||

nt|oleberg: Pass out?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: pass out  or any new day openers|pg||
nt|oleberg: I don't think fourth hand will open this :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|odysseus69: the disease of opening balanced 11 counts has been spreading like flu|pg||

nt|oleberg: but the affliction (opening 11 bal) is worse than the flu|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: and now a real slam |pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|oleberg: Before she took up Bridge, Bekkouche was the second best Danish female backgammon player|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Oh no - 3 @C, please|pg||
nt|odysseus69: pleased to hear a kindred spirit|pg||
nt|hawe45:  3 @C is the right bid, NOT 2 NT|pg||
nt|dburn: eh?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|dburn: unbalanced hands bid suits, balanced hands bid notrump|pg||
nt|oleberg: I prefer 2@D, transfer to hearts. But I guess it is alittle harder to find a kindred spirit. :)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: mayybe some system showing 3 spades in balanced hand|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4D|nt|hawe45:  Hands with small doubletons shouldÂ´nt tell partner the wrong story, when another GOD bis is possible|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: I meant kindred on balanced 11s|pg||
mb|4H|nt|oleberg: Oh|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|nt|dburn: perhaps, but 3@c is hardly a "good bid" - you don't have enough clubs and you don't have nearly enough values|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: apart from that, though, it's fine|pg||
nt|oleberg: Actually, at MP's, I am not so convinced. But at IMP's vs competent opposition, they suck.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  OK|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Then 2 @C|pg||
mb|5H|nt|hawe45:  But slam looks easy to play|pg||
nt|dburn: why distort your hand type? If you were playing a 16-18 no trump, you would open this 1NT, would you not?|pg||
nt|jni33: We have a lot of alerts -- But at this side of the screen Lars does not ask -- so we cant explain the meaning of the bidding :)|pg||
mb|d|mb|6S|mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Yes - but thatÂ´s 40 years ago - but I agree with 2 NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Well done ladies|pg||
nt|oleberg: It is a problem hand. if you bid 3@C on three card-suits, you distort your system|pg||
nt|jni33: 5@d shows 2 aces and an extra @d control|pg||
pc|h8|nt|odysseus69: there are thos who would (right shape right points) and those who wouldnt on every hand which fits (touchy-feely group)|pg||

nt|hawe45:  East just wanted to see, if South could overruff @H...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: All resonable lines succeed, no worries|pg||

mb|3H|nt|odysseus69: everyone happy with 3H?|pg||
nt|oleberg: Lets see if she accompanied by Miss Fortune|pg||
nt|dburn: well, they have a club fit - probably best not to play in it, though|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now Victor, 3@H vulnerable. Are you as brave as Trine?|pg||
mb|p|nt|oleberg: 3@H is a nice gusy bid|pg||
mb|4H|nt|hawe45:  But far better than a weak 2 on that hand|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|jni33: What about 5@d bid?|pg||
nt|oleberg: It is no shame to admit, that an open teams pair is better than you|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|odysseus69: depends whether I had my porridge|pg||
nt|oleberg: So it is ok to take a position on hands that are borderline|pg||
nt|hawe45:  About 800 - or|pg||
nt|dburn: not easy for South - doubtless hoping that North is shorter in hearts than is actually the case|pg||

pc|cQ|pc|cA|pc|c2|nt|oleberg: Maybe @SA first, to suggest heart continuation  if East gets to ruff the third spade|pg||

nt|oleberg: I don't laugh|pg||

nt|hawe45:  I am sure, West will ask for 5-card @S and bid 3 NT|pg||
nt|odysseus69: what is adverised range of 2NT - not that it matters here |pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2NT is, in theory, 20-21|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h5|nt|odysseus69: 3S may be minors or a transferto 3NT-Roland knows|pg||
nt|oleberg: It is ok to have 5-card majors in your 2NT opening, but Easts hand contains much more potential for suit play, if partner has an unbalanced hand|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hT|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not quite, Victor. The K&R Hand Evaluator says 19.75|pg||
