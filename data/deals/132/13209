nt|lestergold: wieird|pg||
nt|othered1: by whom?|pg||
nt|dagold: yes double seems normal, now you have to guess what to bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: by west|pg||
nt|jtr: But i guess you know partner is short in @hs and will protect if better than minimum|pg||
nt|dagold: 2@s now is an underbid|pg||
nt|jtr: But now how many?|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|dagold: and others are silly I think|pg||
nt|dagold: so this could be a 4-3 fit facing Hxx|pg||
nt|dagold: which is why I would double|pg||
nt|othered1: I assume just judged to do business over 2@H.  Oh, I guess not, so first pass is unusual|pg||

nt|dagold: what now?|pg||
nt|dagold: East is not worth double|pg||
nt|othered1: on the other hand, if partner has a weak NT 3-level could be too high|pg||

nt|lestergold: this looks like a dangerous hand .....|pg||

nt|dagold: could be a game and pard leads your void Vs 1nt|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sJ|nt|dagold: the main danger in 4-card overcalls is picking off opponents 4-4 fit...|pg||

nt|dagold: Coyle really might have doubled this|pg||
nt|jtr: Agree|pg||
nt|dagold: i mean it is going down 3 with out breaking sweat|pg||
nt|jtr: Especially since the distribution was already given away inm the bidding|pg||
nt|dagold: yes|pg||
nt|dagold: I think pass is very wet|pg||
nt|lestergold: does Coyle think they may have a better spot eg in diamonds can he be sure they havent|pg||
nt|dagold: that maybe his worry but if they run and partner can't double so what!|pg||
nt|lestergold: aftr all 2@c shoed majors|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|dagold: needs to be 3nt by south (not here)|pg||
nt|lestergold: cetainly not laydown|pg||
nt|jtr: Well, West has a lot of discards to make|pg||
nt|jtr: I dont think he can hold everything|pg||
nt|dagold: he can't|pg||
nt|lestergold: needs to pass ten @h under the table|pg||
nt|jtr: Yes, dummy's @h9 is a great card|pg||
nt|dagold: an ending will come where west must bare the diamond Ace then south can set up a diamond|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h5|pc|hA|pg||
nt|dagold: since west is guarding everything|pg||
nt|dagold: South must just watch carefully the discards|pg||

nt|dagold: as he should be for the 1@h call|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cK|pc|c2|pc|c7|pg||
nt|dagold: now he is down I think|pg||
nt|jtr: Ah now he can exit|pg||

nt|lestergold: was tyhe club and error?|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h7|nt|dagold: yes|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|pg||
nt|jtr: Because that @c by declarer might have been an exit later|pg||
nt|dagold: now the ending doesn't work|pg||
nt|jtr: depending on the discards|pg||
nt|lestergold: so eggers should have run the spades|pg||
nt|dagold: west simply has 2 heart winners|pg||
nt|dagold: he needed to keep the top heart for the ending to work|pg||
pc|s6|nt|dagold: and play all his trumps|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sQ|pc|s2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am not sure how Steve thought that a club could accomplish anything|pg||
nt|lestergold: imnteresting the club superficially looks like a natural enough play|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s9|pc|sA|pc|sJ|pg||

pc|d4|pc|h9|nt|dagold: or must bare the diamond Ace|pg||

nt|dagold: yes that might have done it|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dagold: here the defence were sort of ahead in that declarer thinks diamonds 54 the other way though the discards should wake him up when west throws small club then a big club|pg||
nt|dagold: will look like AKx|pg||
nt|lestergold: looks lioke making on heart lead here|pg||
nt|jtr: Well, South certainly has a @s stop for his 3NT|pg||

pc|dJ|nt|jtr: Great lead|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d7|nt|jtr: here|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|dagold: in the other toom Cliffe responded 1@s. unusual and paerhaps catering to 4-3 spades|pg||

nt|dagold: not my recomendation but that is the argument for it I guess|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d5|pc|d8|pc|d2|pg||
nt|jtr: he might manouvre an endplay|pg||
nt|jtr: But more likely play for Q10@c onside|pg||
nt|dagold: this still has a tiny bit of play if the defence are not careful|pg||
nt|lestergold: what if south tries to play on hearts?|pg||
nt|dagold: well he doesn't have the spots |pg||
nt|jtr: Well, he cant genuinely make a trick himself|pg||
nt|dagold: to make a trick by force, but the defence may go wrong|pg||
nt|lestergold: looks hopeless basically |pg||

nt|dagold: maybe the club Ten from Brian?|pg||
nt|lestergold: tghats what i meant the heart switcj isnt marked|pg||
nt|dagold: with spades|pg||

nt|jtr: West cant really cash a top @h before the @c either|pg||
