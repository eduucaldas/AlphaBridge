mb|p|nt|barnets: he Ace and north plays the 10 ?|pg||
nt|scotty: key is for N to play 10 with 10x, K10x and Q10x.  First is easy, last two are dangerous unless you know a lot about the hand|pg||
nt|barnets: if you lead up to the ace and north plays the 10|pg||
mb|2H|nt|roswolf: bidding this slam isnt a doddle|pg||
nt|dburn: you can save yourself these agonies by just cashing the ace - that's as good as anything else|pg||
