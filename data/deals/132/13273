pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s3|pg||
nt|jcwla: If W did not open 1NT, could choose to open 1@S and then over a forcing 1NT (if being used) would have to choose between a flawed 2@D and a slightly underpowered 2NT (usu 18-19).|pg||
nt|othered1: On last hand, maybe 5@HX-1 is actually par, since 5@D figures to make.|pg||

nt|haans: 2@H only 6 for many |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|othered1: Not even close to me, since it fails almost all of my criteria|pg||
pc|cT|nt|chick: I disagree with opening 2@H holding 7.   Knowledge of your length makes it much easier for partner to judge.|pg||

nt|chick: There is a very big difference in 2@H hands and 3@H hands, much more than 1 extra trump|pg||

nt|othered1: It's fine to agree that 2@H is always 6, but that's not the only way to play.|pg||
nt|chick: I agree Jordan.  3@H does not promise honors, texture, or concentration, whereas 2@H does.   3@H promises only length and a few points somewhere|pg||
nt|jcwla: 2@H the way I play it is NOT a compromise bid - if I don't have it, I don't make it.|pg||
nt|chick: Again I agree with Jordan.  Having 6 cards in a suit is not a reason to make a weak 2 bid.  |pg||
