nt|chick: Hi Jeroen :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzeg: wb Jeroen|pg||
nt|benjent: 4@h looks kind of ok single dummy, but the evil @s & @d breaks are going to create some problems|pg||
nt|jpmbs:  nice contract to start with|pg||
mb|2C|nt|benjent: The defence have to be careful. For example, if North tries a low @s at trick 2, declarer is in good shape|pg||
nt|benjent: The cleanest defence is to play trumps. North would like to do that, but he'll be thinking about whether he can afford to overtake the @s9 with his weak @s pips|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a trumph switch will break|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|ralfwil: a @h switch is not so difficult from S either|pg||
nt|benjent: And now it's a very hard task for South to find the @h switch|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|benjent: from his point of view, it's not clear that @d ruffs is a major threat|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|ralfwil: But with only @hQ8, only an enpassant is a trick|pg||
mb|p|nt|benjent: For all he new, with his poorly placed @cK, the defence needed to cash 2 @d tricks ... and partner's @s5 at tricks one might have suggested a @d switch|pg||

mb|5C|nt|xenya: nice|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: 21 HCP game, but it will work|pg||
nt|benjent: Meanwhile, back at the ranch, 4@s is a pretty good contract but beatable on a @c ruff|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|ralfwil: will go down if EW take their @c ruff|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: East can overtake to force it, but would west read it as doubleton?|pg||
nt|benjent: West might find the low @c switch now, just as an ordinary kind of defence|pg||
nt|ritong: east should have took this to revert to @cs|pg||
nt|benjent: I think it's better for East to duck as he did - the @c is kind of an obvious switch|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I think E should have taken over and returned a @c|pg||
nt|chick: a low club at this point might not look very attractive, given no info about partner's club shortness|pg||
nt|ritong: taken*|pg||
nt|othered1: @H looks more obvious to me|pg||
nt|chick: Ralf has it right, E must show the club ruff possibility|pg||
nt|chick: (and Henri) :)|pg||
nt|Walddk3: You cheering for France, Henri? :)|pg||
nt|ritong: np|pg||
nt|benjent: If East overtakes the @d and shifts to a @c, it will look very much like a singleton|pg||
nt|ritong: naaaah:)|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Must be a nice situation for you|pg||
nt|Vugraphzeg: As a kib points out, the @D7 is often played as s/p here, and W has all the low cards but the 4, he might get it right|pg||

nt|ralfwil: hello Vladimir!|pg||

nt|chick: Italy can make 4@S, so this won't be a good score for them, though|pg||

nt|xenya: another exciting hand?|pg||

mb|4H|nt|ritong: what would you think with south hand and all that noise?:)|pg||
nt|brolucius: 7NT allows you to combine more than one chance.|pg||
nt|brolucius: To bid 7@C or 7@S (instead of 7NT) forces you to hope for a good position in your chosen trump suit.|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am told that in the Closed Room West led the two of trumps from @SQ-2 and declarer finessed on the second round!|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Mind you, the guy who told me has logged off very quickly and I now here that the story was wrong. |pg||
nt|brolucius: Trump lead from the other side.|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Even so, why play for the lead to be from @SQ-x-x?!|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, yes, 100 kibs tell me taht North was declarer. But if you win first spade and then finesse on the second round, you are assuming that East has led from Q-x-x in trumps. |pg||
nt|jcwla: Not quite the same when S has monster @S suit as when they're relatively evenly divided.|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|nt|brolucius: France need to pick up some IMPs on this big opportunity.|pg||

mb|p|nt|xenya: 7N very reasonable here|pg||
mb|5N|nt|benjent: For those pairs, it's handy to have a power X in your arsenal!|pg||

nt|xenya: i'm with them|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|chick: you need about 70% for a grand and this is close to that|pg||
nt|xenya: it is a great contract|pg||

nt|xenya: tough hand|pg||
nt|chick: common lead against 7 is a trump|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ralfwil: if 7nt is far better than 7@s|pg||

pc|s5|nt|benjent: Not to be unkind, but I think Volcker is pursuing the worst of all possible defensive strategies|pg||

nt|ralfwil: If W had @sK perhaps a D, as he know, that 6nt is an accepted invite slam|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|benjent: leading from xxx is unlikely to blow more than a 2-way guess, and is therefore probably the safer of the 2|pg||
nt|benjent: I think if you gave this hand to every player in this field, the majority would find the @c lead, but many would be finding it for safety, not so much to try to get a trick|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|benjent: That's a very good point Ralf|pg||

nt|benjent: Of course, if partner has a @s trick, it's relatively likely to be always coming to you|pg||

pc|s4|nt|ralfwil: I had plöayed a @c back to @cK and after that I could read how defence should be|pg||

nt|benjent: North's pair of @d pitches have suggested the @d switch pretty strongly to East|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but he didn´t|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ralfwil: E can decide that after a small @c back to @cK|pg||
nt|chick: Ralf, when/why is the finesse better with no opposing bidding?|pg||
nt|xenya: had E interfered at any point, N would have made it i think|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dJ|nt|benjent: To escape even a little, I think declarer is going to have to run @hQ to West to take out his entry|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|s9|pc|sT|pg||

nt|chick: well, he does have nice intermediates|pg||
nt|benjent: I'd really like a medium @d raise. South's life would have been much easier if North had rebid 1NT (easy pass), but that's obviously anti-system for them|pg||
nt|ritong: pard did not open 1 NT third seat at fav, he s not supposed to hold pleasant 14|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dA|pg||
pc|hA|nt|othered1: 1@S rebid doesn't promise balanced shape, so inference on NT opening isn't very strong.|pg||
nt|benjent: Neat @sj from Volcker - playing the technically correct double-finesse against Q and 10 of spades through West|pg||
nt|ritong: on the other hand, if pard is shaped, he will bid again over 1 NT|pg||
nt|benjent: It's actually the @s6 which makes it the correct play!|pg||

mb|6H|mb|p|nt|gmed65: for a grand slam i think|pg||
nt|brolucius: North should be wary, with only @S10-x-x-x in support of South's second suit.|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|jcwla: 12 a push at 3NT/N (despite more favorable @S lead position) as CR finishes up and we welcome those who have joined us from in there.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Contracts in a 4-4 fit are much less secure than those in a 5-4 fit. |pg||
nt|jcwla: 3NT-2 that is.|pg||
nt|brolucius: It would be a disaster to stretch to a very borderline 7@S when the opponents had gone down in 6@S.|pg||
nt|brolucius: L'huissier knows that he can make the daily bulletin by bidding 7@S, but he does not know why they will write it up.|pg||
nt|ritong: he has a choice |pg||

mb|p|nt|ralfwil: do you all like 2@d?|pg||
nt|ritong: i do not advocate the @d switch, just trying to explain it|pg||

mb|2S!|mb|p|nt|benjent: Oh, I understood Henri - I certainly didn't think you were voting for the @d switch|pg||

mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|benjent: Hmmm .... Volcker's double-crossing himself a little here|pg||
nt|othered1: For me, if west were an ace worse, he'd need more @D length and shape.|pg||
nt|benjent: 2@s was probably going to be a perfectly acceptable contract in the 4-3. 3@h could be a 5-0 for all he knows|pg||
nt|ritong: by the way, i think NS have a strong advantage in this situation playing the last boards of a relatively important tourney with 600+ kibs  as we can see, east tends to  play ...|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|xenya: but as a few shrewd kibitzers point out, the safety play looked dangerous because of a possible club ruff -- i agree |pg||

nt|othered1: As long as south absolutely guarantees a rebid over 2@H.  does he?|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s5|pg||
pc|c9|nt|benjent: But 2@h could be made with zero spades and one heart. So long as you are confident that pass is forcing, then North has an easy forcing pass|pg||

nt|ritong: setting up the glue for the rest of the auction|pg||
nt|Vugraphzeg: I wish my French was as fluent as theirs :)|pg||
