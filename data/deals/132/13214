nt|vugraphzeg: EW were discussing some defence against the special stuff of NS|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Erwin, did they issue the 6@c contract on the bulletin played yesterday? :)|pg||
nt|pierced: will the israelian have their victory|pg||

nt|pierced: salut :)|pg||

nt|haans: Hi and Welcome to http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=80&Itemid=72|pg||

nt|sybarra: welcome Hans |pg||
nt|hawe45:  thks|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This MUST BE a coffee-board - I vote for 450 and no swing|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 4@H/@S EW|pg||
nt|sybarra: *Bessis|pg||
nt|copeyj: Good morning all|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hello Hamdi|pg||
nt|yo_yo: any idea what suction is?|pg||
nt|othered1: rehi, everyone!|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: anyone 4 3@C pre?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: likely 3N for EW|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hello everyone|pg||
nt|haans: normally balanced 12-14|pg||
mb|1H|nt|szalay: I strongly believe its an option in white|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Owen Lien and Doug Dey are players from North Carolina (District 7)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hey buddies, gl operator|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: things are going wrong with the boards|pg||
nt|haans: what should nilsen bid|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i can live withh 1N|pg||
nt|sharkey: 1 NT|pg||
nt|h_karluk: welcome back|pg||
nt|szalay: doubt they will bid it|pg||
nt|chick: 3N unspecified splinter?|pg||
nt|szalay: hi all|pg||
nt|sybarra: S  was our operator in last match |pg||
nt|yuval10: W is Giampietro, Cristina|pg||
nt|daman: would we double with the South hand?|pg||
nt|haans: double?|pg||
nt|daman: or would we bid 2@C?    2@H?|pg||
nt|daman: pass is not an option|pg||
nt|haans: diamond will win|pg||
nt|chick: 2@H would be my choice|pg||
nt|haans: 2+ is alertable|pg||
nt|daman: it really doesn't matter because West will always compete in @Ds|pg||
nt|sybarra: gm Simon :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: Hello Simon|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hello everyone from Manchester|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Hey y'all , welcome to White House Juniors - Round Robin 15 of 23|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hello hamdi|pg||
nt|h_karluk: welcome back Kath|pg||
nt|h_karluk: however likely a 4@h game for NS, obvious losers are a @h, a @c and a @d|pg||
nt|othered1: What special stuff?|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: 9-12 NT and some brown stickers|pg||
nt|lestergold: no!|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: overbidding|pg||
nt|daman: 2@D must be a transfer|pg||
nt|chick: transfer advances?|pg||
nt|haans: if they make 1ntx they get 180|pg||
nt|daman: oui|pg||
nt|haans: :) Hi and Welcome :)|pg||
nt|haans: not all open clubs here|pg||
nt|haans: good passing|pg||
nt|pierced: they play multi|pg||
mb|1N|nt|rnmalik: there are chances for going overboard, funny hand first up|pg||
nt|szalay: hi all|pg||
nt|ady: n/s may get to game in no-trumps    likely to go down|pg||
nt|haans: yep |pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/index.php?option=com_frontpage&Itemid=76|pg||
nt|szalay: I suppose 2@H was both majors|pg||
nt|sybarra: you can find list of participants, and standings on that site|pg||
nt|szalay: btw its a bit strange North didnt open|pg||
nt|szalay: probably 4@D SPL is the best bid by West|pg||
nt|haans: looks like bergen raise|pg||
nt|h_karluk: nevertheless EW have effective defense|pg||
nt|haans: not to nice bidding|pg||
nt|haans: we all been there|pg||
nt|sybarra: you almost had to bid the 8654 |pg||
nt|sybarra: but if you stick to 4 card suits up the line |pg||
nt|haans: u will soon|pg||
nt|othered1: 26 HCP, a bunch of tricks, and a very lucky @H suit blockage, so 3N is on.|pg||
nt|sybarra: had=hate |pg||
nt|lestergold: 3@s the limit|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: will e/e  steal the contract    n/s can make a lucky 3NT  and make and make a safer contract in diamonds  10 tricks|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hello Kath from South Carolina, Columbia|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i was just looking at the list of countries playing  but what is the World Team?|pg||
nt|othered1: but good bidding may keep them out of it.|pg||
nt|yuval10: 2@d reverse drury 9-11 points exactly 3 @h's|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: Israel play stad Israeli, I believe: strong NT, 5 card major, etc.|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: EW play natural, I think|pg||
nt|frankaus: not me  - 4 @S  would tempt me|pg||
nt|frankaus: then i'm a senior|pg||
nt|szalay: match starts with a boring 3N|pg||
nt|haans: doomed|pg||
nt|sybarra: and S has no further interest |pg||
nt|szalay: I dont suggest spl with 3 trumps only|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh, sorry,  S is brother of operator of last match |pg||
nt|chick: nor do I|pg||
nt|chick: E will leave that with his heart holding|pg||
nt|daman: West will balance|pg||
nt|haans: Hi Simon|pg||
nt|h_karluk: such as playing @h A then @c to cut ruff|pg||
nt|haans: SUCTION: When suction is agreed, a suit overcall of a 1NT opening is conventional and denies the suit actually bid. It shows either (1) a one-suiter in the next higher ranking suit ...|pg||
nt|haans: or (2) a two suiter in the other two suits|pg||
nt|haans: as HagZ say 3NT makes|pg||
mb|p|nt|VugraphPl1: http://michzimny.pl/bridge/2010/pila/gp.html|pg||
nt|ady: e/w can make 3NT    but hardly bidable|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=80&Itemid=72  for participants |pg||
nt|rnmalik: EW have 9 tricks as the cards are placed, agree.|pg||
nt|szalay: ok, u can drink coffee, he will make it|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I suggest - but do not support|pg||
nt|chick: many people like to play 1@S 4@H as natural hearts, so 3N gives a way to make a heart splinter|pg||
nt|chick: but in this hand, I would just bid a 2/1 2@D (or other game force)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  So would we all, I think|pg||
nt|haans: diamond will win|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ady: 2@H open room so will be a push|pg||
nt|hawe45:  2 NT checking for slam ambitions|pg||
nt|chick: imho, S is not strong enough for 2N|pg||
nt|haans: no stop there|pg||
nt|yuval10: T@s looks like the natural lead|pg||
nt|haans: many nowday bid 2nt invite or better|pg||
nt|yuval10: link for results : http://www.nbbportal.nl/1003/|pg||
nt|yuval10: click on "competitie"|pg||
nt|chick: W already neglected to bid @Ds, would be surprised to see him come in at the 3 level|pg||
nt|othered1: south has a very good looking hand for this auction|pg||
nt|haans: only game that makes|pg||
nt|lestergold: unless they read heart position|pg||
nt|petergill: !NT on a spade lead might be quite interesting to play|pg||
nt|petergill: 1NT|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hello Peter!|pg||
pc|s9|nt|sybarra: do we have running scores Jacco?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: last time i saw Owen in Tri City (West Columbia) sectional, he is 21 y.o., educating in Economics branch in NC State College|pg||
nt|haans: clubs lead?|pg||
nt|haans: best|pg||
nt|ady: even on the lead will go down on a heart switch|pg||
nt|daman: uh oh|pg||
nt|haans: that double is new|pg||
nt|h_karluk: cake and walk contract, push next please |pg||
nt|sybarra: thx Hans |pg||
nt|yo_yo: thanks|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: has Whibley shown his good hand?|pg||
nt|haans: Hi Peter|pg||
pc|sK|nt|xenya: well EW can make 6@D|pg||
nt|szalay: but if u have singleton, better to show it yourself|pg||
nt|daman: it was OK for him to pass 2@D    he was going to get anpther chance to bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: EW lead 2/4|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think 3@h is a bit exaggerated call with such balanced junk|pg||
nt|haans: bridge here is just tuff :)|pg||
nt|tomi2: maybe some kind of transfer? allows you to bid your fit with weak hands like this or stronger ones (raise later again)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: good evening all|pg||
nt|h_karluk: welcome back Ralf|pg||
nt|yuval10: 2@c would've been 7-11 4 @h's |pg||
nt|pierced: 8 tricks are coming|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 4th seat 4cm M, maybe 1@d has a different meaning there or say in case lost auction might try to show the lead to his p|pg||
nt|yuval10: this lead will help declarer|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|szalay: after given bidding best trump play (double hook) is even better|pg||
nt|xenya: hello again|pg||
nt|haans: opening 1@C was suicide here|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe should have ducked that one |pg||
nt|haans: did not like @C switch|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: he was afraid for @C's wasnt he?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: good lead|pg||
nt|haans: believe so|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: Justin said so, probably he did|pg||
nt|petergill: You can take the obvious line of play and finesse South for @CQ, failing, or|pg||
nt|petergill: Hi Ralf, Hans|pg||
pc|s5|nt|szalay: ok, u can try 6@D, but its terrible...long run I dont suggest slams with 30 hcp and 2 balanced hands|pg||
nt|szalay: bid your games, take your tricks (by Hamman) is good advice in any level|pg||
nt|sybarra: I take it this is the "slam try" sequence |pg||
nt|szalay: with aceless 11, with Qx @C I wd just say 3N, confess|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: I think east made a slamtry here, that is what i heard from the explanation from west|pg||
nt|szalay: a bit starnge 3@C rebid except its forcing (doubt it) with 9 top tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: nope it works now|pg||
nt|hawe45:  East and West doÂ´nt play the same system here|pg||
nt|haans: not in agrement here|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i would RD there onstead of 2@d, 2ndly i would definitely start with 1@h|pg||
nt|haans: 2@D show support|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|ady: west should know on the 2 lead that north has 5 clubs|pg||
nt|haans: whappen happened her|pg||
nt|frankaus: 15 2 H in pd major - pd opens - how many will stay short of game?|pg||
nt|haans: non vul yes |pg||
nt|haans: you need 50% to bid game|pg||
nt|h_karluk: my sys card is 2/1 - so it's impossible to stop before game with EW hands|pg||
nt|szalay: and ART asking bid w/o shortness|pg||
nt|daman: the axe might be unsheathed again|pg||
nt|daman: but maybe not|pg||
nt|daman: 3@C was very risky given North only promises 2|pg||
nt|chick: true, but ... he is better getting in his one bid at the first chance and then stay very quiet|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: So the names will be up soon again|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ah i see|pg||
nt|haans: if no double all ok|pg||
nt|sybarra: not easy when 1 cl opened on your right |pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: NS lead 2/4, and \west tells he has a lot\|pg||
nt|sybarra: brb  on ne pc |pg||
nt|haans: more normal is playing polish against polish|pg||
nt|sybarra: re |pg||
nt|haans: we got it :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: but EW are from down under, so not really used to play against Polish\|pg||
pc|sA|nt|szalay: if it was slamtry, West wd accept for sure|pg||
nt|h_karluk: he and his mother Miss Anita are BBO players|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Yuval Yener|pg||
nt|yuval10: hi all|pg||
nt|haans: mirrow hands not thye best|pg||
nt|h_karluk: unfortunately i've no idea , maybe just a show match, saw in Venice Olympiads long years ago|pg||
pc|s7|nt|frankaus: i can handle the language of a child in hungarian but no idea about bridge terminology|pg||
nt|sybarra: this match is  2 Francy v   3 Neth. Blue|pg||
nt|hawe45:  He had seen his cards...(North)|pg||
nt|haans: diamond will win|pg||
nt|vbman: hi all|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hi welcome|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @h A and @c back obvious|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so that leaves alone with 2 more @c losers|pg||
nt|haans: Ficher may discard a spade|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|sharkey: sry - crashed|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Also welcome to Adam Kaplan|pg||
nt|haans: easy 1nt in my book (as opener)|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Hi all :)|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Adam|pg||
nt|haans: hi adam still only 14?|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: *still*, yes :)|pg||
nt|haans: well cure for that|pg||
nt|othered1: I couldn't stay out of @C game on this auction (but I would have overcalled, not doubled as north)|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: they overcall light (they said)|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: so dbl and bidding suit is light too\|pg||
nt|haans: yep make or fall nothing else :|pg||
pc|cT|nt|h_karluk: and then RD?|pg||
nt|haans: same distribution|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like 2 off|pg||
nt|vbman: if the 8 spot promises smt|pg||
nt|yo_yo: and how are the teams doing, has anyone a link?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|haans: :(|pg||
nt|jcwla: Why 4@S?|pg||
nt|tomi2: seen no reason to bid 4@S with that stuff in red suits|pg||
pc|c4|nt|szalay: we will see trump play|pg||
nt|Walddk4: West is Giampetro|pg||
nt|daman: down 2 |pg||
nt|haans: 2 down|pg||
nt|copeyj: Many people after (1@C)-X-(1M) play X as showing 4 and bid 2M with 5, but obviously not Bessis/Volcker|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i am just looking horrified that that opening bid|pg||
nt|haans: now bloody |pg||
nt|ralfwil: That is not my first choice. play on any red suit first|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|sybarra: costs nothing to put up the q |pg||
nt|szalay: as u probably know: u must leas Q first|pg||
nt|yuval10: Operator can you please insert W's name?  |pg||
nt|yo_yo: EW might get a few penalties in this match|pg||
nt|petergill: the anti-percentage inferior line which of course works is, once the spades are 4-4, you can exit in hearts, and hope if hearts are 3-3, the defence ends up endplayed. |pg||
pc|h8|nt|haans: flat board|pg||
nt|ady: cash to clubs puts pressure on west   has to discard a heart   but still down 1|pg||
nt|haans: are they playing Magic Diamond?|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: seems like a crossruff will come to 11 tricks fairly easily|pg||
nt|h_karluk: in ACBL absolutely|pg||
nt|h_karluk: seriously @s 2 or @d 2 ?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: these 2 teams are the current leaders?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: to me @d 2 obvious , are we sure abt @s2 input please?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: you know what they tell in wedding ceremonies : speak now or remain silent forever, i guess it's similar at bridge tables :)|pg||
nt|haans: 6th trick in clubs|pg||
pc|h5|nt|szalay: French pair won Bonn Open Teams (Nations Cup) last year|pg||
nt|haans: lucky bidding :)|pg||
nt|pierced: france need to win this match to secure the semis|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ady: would expect 130 to be flat    but you never know|pg||
nt|haans: many play x as take out|pg||
nt|h_karluk: no way when he looks at the table|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|szalay: personally I wd open West as 2N, if it starts at 20...7 controls, 4 tricks|pg||
nt|haans: i would sday just cards|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ahh there were also one in Lille 98 France|pg||
nt|haans: five clubs|pg||
nt|haans: still 1 down|pg||
nt|othered1: Eve3n if the auction is lighter than usual, south does have two aces, four trumps and a possibly useful 3rd round @S control.|pg||
nt|haans: play anti only double dummy :)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|haans: flat deal im sure|pg||
pc|h3|nt|yuval10: Croatia is 6th, Germany yellow 13th|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ah thanks to spec:  the world champions from istanbul|pg||
nt|po-s: really? from two different countries?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: unfortunately i was abroad from home country|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hT|pg||

nt|yo_yo: 2 teams!|pg||
nt|yo_yo: lots have 2 teams|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|sybarra: you had another website for us |pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: I dont see them yet. Red vs Blue was 22-8|pg||
nt|h_karluk: we hope that's real per olaf|pg||
nt|yo_yo: japan and the czech republic, seems an odd combination   :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i guess they've enough trophies in such events|pg||
nt|ralfwil: nice @h10!|pg||
nt|petergill: The defence may be going astray, and losing their @D trick|pg||
pc|h6|nt|szalay: cause u can gain JTxx in South, but not in North|pg||
nt|szalay: lead|pg||
nt|daman: by passng and then doubling West was able to show his shape|pg||
nt|daman: which is helpful|pg||
nt|h_karluk: nicely defended|pg||
nt|haans: like now|pg||
nt|haans: @H?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: bad discard! play on @h3-3|pg||
nt|petergill: Yes, but South was not fooled With @HJ74, North would play @H4, not @H7 |pg||
pc|s6|nt|ady: force dummy with heart now|pg||
nt|ady: othjerwise 11 tricks|pg||

nt|h_karluk: some pairs play support doubles and redoubles, a matter of style|pg||

nt|daman: he should have 9 cards in the pointeds|pg||
nt|haans: ruffing clubs|pg||

nt|vbman: its not much practical to open 1sp with this in front of an unpassed pard|pg||

pc|c8|nt|h_karluk: and Israel also would like to win it to recover some losses|pg||

nt|sybarra: him?  |pg||
nt|h_karluk: -2, push next board please|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|yuval10: i'm not so sure about this hand being a flat....quite possible for NS to stay away of game here|pg||

nt|szalay: true, after 8 of @H highy unlikely North has void in trumps...but devil never sleeps|pg||
nt|pierced: if they win , they could avoid frenchmen in the final|pg||
nt|xenya: the @H finesse was not a guess -- just a sure play for 8 tricks|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|sybarra: over killed it...|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|frankaus: hoping that guess is wrong here|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hard to underlead from A, so imho cld play for a hook|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|h_karluk: transposed|pg||

nt|h_karluk: both defenders have safe discards|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|mcphee: bad news for declarer:(|pg||
nt|petergill: The @h pitch from dummy was like a "fisr board on vugraph" error, not quite focussed fully for the game yet|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|haans: most do not really know how to defend against 4-2 :)|pg||

nt|cuttysark: Alwas difficult to defend 1NT - and to play it|pg||
nt|marlowepi: fortunately it is easy to bid it|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: another grand|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: the sixteenth trick is on the club finesse, which loses|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Could be hard to diagnose that you have exactly 13 top tricks|pg||
nt|ritong: other room auction should please you, marshall|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What 15 tricks?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 2 ruffs in dummy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But I want the 10 extra for 7NT|pg||
nt|ritong: when south rebids 3@s it goes plain sailing|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|2D|nt|Walddk2: Besides, they can't ruff anything against NT|pg||
nt|ritong: after that, just a matter of keys number, and also having thirteen fingers|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Or as David Burn puts it: "You can't make 3NT on a cross-ruff"|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Granted 6NT is superior, but this is because there is not bonus for the overtricks in 7@S|pg||
nt|cuttysark: And yes, I meant 7 - typing fingers are dyslexic today|pg||
nt|marlowepi: fringes?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Is North's partner hung now?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: sorry|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you know you are playing in top form when as W you lead a low club against 7NT :):)|pg||
nt|ritong: roland...:)|pg||
mb|2N|nt|cuttysark: Oh plEEEEZ]|pg||
nt|ritong: they might recover, but less easy now|pg||
mb|4D|nt|Walddk2: 5@D now and take it from there|pg||
nt|ritong: much less with EW noises|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W should bid 5D to take KC away|pg||
nt|cuttysark: What was 2@C, exactly?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't know what 2@C is (bid in both rooms), but I don't think I like it no matter what|pg||
nt|copeyj: 2@C was either balanced GF or natural GF|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He has neither|pg||
nt|cuttysark: So which does this hand have?|pg||
nt|copeyj: Agreed :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: canape GF:)|pg||
nt|copeyj: I have south's big brother sitting next to me and he has reliably informed me :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: How are they going to proceed from here?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Bring back the strong jump shift, say I|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well in the previous match we saw a player disdain to mention his six-bagger with 1o0 honors (that was the swing hand), so not a total shock to see a five-bagger with 150 honors ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sit on the shelf|pg||
nt|xenya: what do we know about the 2NT bid? It can't be natural|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: Amen Liz, I am with you: 1S-3H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Have they set trumps yet?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: EW have set trumps:)|pg||
nt|ritong: not really|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|nt|ritong: cooked|pg||
nt|marlowepi: spec points out that 8@D is a good sacrifice. true enough, it only goes for what one of David Bird's characters calls "Big Twenty"|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: so the 3@s rebid other room with a broken suit turned out really well|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Give some credit to Kilani. His 2@D seems to have made it too difficult for N-S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: assume that is tongue-in-cheek, since it used up no bidding space|pg||
nt|ritong: it does when raised|pg||
nt|cuttysark: When they are using artificial methods you should intevene whenever you can - make the auction unfamiliar and they will have problems|pg||
nt|ritong: which is the target of any overcall, finally|pg||

nt|szalay: East, sry|pg||
nt|ady: J@C   big card in west hand   e/w can make 3NT|pg||
nt|ady: danger of 1@C being passed out|pg||
nt|szalay: I think 1@C is not an option|pg||
nt|sybarra: and stiff A of @C makes the hand easy|pg||
nt|szalay: either 2N or (semi)forcing 2@C/@D|pg||

nt|po-s: hi Bob|pg||
nt|mcphee: i did not particularly like the 1N response last hand|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think 2@s fine now|pg||
nt|jcwla: This just looks like "mine is bigger than yours" -- suit that is.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: such 3@h dangerous with balanced junks - proved|pg||
nt|sybarra: a good hand that only makes 2,   |pg||
nt|haans: rehi |pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: they agree all that the @H layout was unlucky for NS|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: they made 9, no clue how though|pg||

mb|p|nt|szalay: what wd u bid over 1@C-1x-?|pg||
nt|pelu: hi all|pg||
nt|szalay: funny board|pg||
nt|haans: card to 3@S?|pg||
nt|chick: 3@S for me|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, just stuck to his original plan|pg||
nt|copeyj: yes|pg||
nt|haans: only Nab if an ms|pg||
nt|copeyj: south is Frederic Volcker|pg||
nt|haans: is an ms|pg||
nt|xenya: the finesse worked|pg||
nt|ralfwil: first grand!|pg||
mb|1S|nt|haans: Ms Ormay opening|pg||
nt|copeyj: I wonder what Nab will open|pg||
nt|Walddk4: As long as she is not amiss|pg||
nt|copeyj: I am sure some people would choose 1NT especially 3rd seat nv|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 23-17 and we'll see what comes from the hat|pg||
nt|h_karluk: it's ok, i saw inputs are correct and reasonable|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: if u go to normal games: go as fast as u can...dont give them chance to interfere|pg||
nt|sybarra: probably a preemptive @D raise coming |pg||
nt|szalay: why not 4@H with passed pd?|pg||
nt|frankaus: Ax no the best stopper in the world often better played from Qx side|pg||
nt|szalay: slam is unlikely, @H are good, so?|pg||
nt|sybarra: but unlikely to keep e/w out of 4 @H |pg||
nt|sybarra: you had the one with the picture |pg||
nt|sharkey: appears 4@S can be made - however, may have transportation problems|pg||
nt|ady: part score hand    n/s may be able to stop in 2@D|pg||
nt|chick: with all their controls, can EW stay out of the @D slam?|pg||
nt|szalay: good 4@Hs fails, worse 3N COULD be make (for @H lead)|pg||
nt|xenya: i would be content with just 1@S|pg||
nt|haans: ms|pg||
nt|copeyj: there we go|pg||
nt|copeyj: Some pairs play X of a strong NT as artificial, including myself. But when the opps have opened 1N 3rd seat nv I play penalty doubles|pg||
nt|copeyj: Would be useful here to have a penalty double available|pg||
nt|tomi2: no blame to the 3@H bid imo if he howed 4 card fit with some values. 4@S was the expensive bid|pg||
nt|pierced: they will fight for medal in philadelphia|pg||
nt|haans: 2nt|pg||
mb|2C|nt|sybarra: the website|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like 12 tricks for me....previous hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Peter |pg||
nt|szalay: it was 11-14 NT|pg||
nt|daman: another partscore?   EW have the potential for a lot of tricks in @Cs|pg||
nt|po-s: depends how mny diamonds 1D showed. Nowadays......|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: looks like a 30 point deck to E |pg||
nt|h_karluk: so far EW 5@c-1 and NS 4@s -1|pg||
nt|szalay: pass with 4 hcp (including a King) very dangerous|pg||
nt|ady: even 2NT opening did not get them to game|pg||
nt|sybarra: can S venture a bid,  yes he does|pg||
nt|sybarra: n/s may push them a bit here|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I only bid 2 @H here with a @h-suit...|pg||
nt|chick: you think S's suit is too weak?|pg||
nt|yuval10: i would've pass from E, to be honest|pg||
nt|haans: nothing perfect|pg||
nt|daman: and can make 8 tricks in NT|pg||
nt|sybarra: can xx and land in clubs |pg||
nt|mcphee: E might try for game here|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 4H looks OK but not enough points to bid it probably|pg||
nt|haans: talking about old deals Is that winning bridge?|pg||
nt|petergill: If North can identify South with six spades, @SAK and the two aces, North can count the 13 tricks|pg||
mb|3S|nt|haans: then we understand|pg||
nt|po-s: In France I bet they have penalty doubles|pg||
nt|h_karluk: http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/     to watch other rooms same time |pg||
nt|poohbear: I am sure declarer played for the failing Squeeze|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @s overcall quite interesting|pg||
nt|vbman: not my party|pg||

mb|p|nt|sybarra: and E with 4333....|pg||

nt|sybarra: this may go 2 @H all pass |pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: yes but that is a blog|pg||
nt|ady: n/s likely to play 2@H|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i would even not try it|pg||
nt|sharkey: Standings after 2 rounds: http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=85&Itemid=79|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: after 3 rounds actuallly|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but i would rebid 1N as West|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 3@c wouldn't be much fun to play|pg||
nt|copeyj: Double is probably artificial it has been alerted|pg||
nt|copeyj: Bessis will be pleasantly surprised by his partner's choice of suit|pg||
nt|copeyj: note E/W can get out for 300 in 5@CX|pg||
nt|copeyj: and even 6@CX is a profitable save against 11 tricks in @S|pg||
nt|mcphee: to coind a phrase, points smoints|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Kopecky is bidding up¬|pg||
nt|vbman: yes its non vuln. but the suit quality is below zero|pg||
nt|othered1: not to  me, but I know many players for whom it's irrelevant.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i guess physical and mental firmness will tell last words, short breaks between matches|pg||
nt|ralfwil: now he can |pg||
nt|petergill: 3@S helps, showing six spades and a good hand|pg||
nt|haans: but must find @SK|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 4nt and 4 aces|pg||
mb|4N!|nt|h_karluk: interesting 1NT|pg||
nt|szalay: in junior/female tourney I think to play weak nt 2/1 is an advantage|pg||
nt|haans: and a make :)|pg||
nt|haans: and then ...|pg||
nt|haans: good pass by south|pg||
nt|Walddk4: If LC had been here, he would call 3@S an anti-Law bid|pg||
nt|haans: 1st time ive seen walsh trf here|pg||
nt|h_karluk: these kids jumping too much|pg||
nt|petergill: South is less well placed to bid the grand himself, as he cannot visualise the solid five heart tricks in partner's hand|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but N can see 13 tricks after that S has shown 4 aces|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: 4@s is some bid by N, P has a very good support though|pg||
nt|yuval10: and now probably bid 5@s ?|pg||
nt|sharkey: Gembick's pass??|pg||
nt|haans: 1n bye North?|pg||
nt|haans: nopåe|pg||
nt|haans: not a nice bid when vul|pg||
nt|sharkey: They've landed in their best strain|pg||
nt|ady: north 2@D rebid very respectable|pg||
nt|sybarra: dout you get killed at the 2 level,  I would bid  ...sort of only chance|pg||
nt|sybarra: *doubt |pg||
nt|chick: should make this|pg||
nt|haans: dirty hand for 4@S but best choice|pg||
nt|h_karluk: if only 4 cards support would be a scale to fix everything, then there were not much words|pg||
nt|haans: all bid and bid and bid|pg||
nt|haans: to long way to slam|pg||
nt|othered1: what was double? |pg||
mb|5C|nt|sybarra: ir 2 @C all pass |pg||
nt|haans: 2@D must be 6-carder|pg||
nt|ady: unfortunately may well go down |pg||
nt|pelu: I would open 2NT (20-21) - over 1@C - 1X I bid 3MT = 15-18 with long @C|pg||
nt|daman: 5@C was aggressive|pg||
nt|mcphee: attack or passive lead?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: personally i didn't get 2NT rebid, OK 15 there however 5431, maybe a good reason to start with F---y convention, but it seems not in their CC|pg||
nt|yo_yo: gosh a working 13 opposite a balanced 8 count|pg||
nt|haans: West have told u|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: why not double by South?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 2254 and 15|pg||
nt|hawe45:  By several levels too weak - and only @C-lead defeats 6 @D|pg||
nt|szalay: its not true Open highest level|pg||
nt|yuval10: i think it's makeable in any way, via @c finesse|pg||
nt|haans: if opps do not play @H raise @D|pg||
nt|mcphee: this may fail|pg||
nt|yo_yo: what's  that convention?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and i think 1M>2M in their book is 8-10 max, if that's true i wld gladly offer 2@s rebid|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: 2nt was shortness in @c they say|pg||
nt|mcphee: declarer needs to do a lot of work|pg||
nt|mcphee: looks like 1 down to me|pg||
nt|yo_yo: isnt it 3 losers?|pg||
nt|mcphee: i doubt they will allow a dummy entry after this lead|pg||
nt|mcphee: low @D fro hand to the 8 or 9 only way to make now|pg||
nt|h_karluk: srry for my wrong input abt E's holding, 4531 is correct|pg||
nt|petergill: Is AJ10xxxxx, -, Kx, KQx a possible 3@S bid. If so, North has to bid 5@S over 5@C, then South will bid on, as is required with 4 keycards. |pg||
nt|haans: but 3@S???|pg||
mb|7N|nt|ady: best spot for n/s is clubs  but unable to get there|pg||
nt|sybarra: a @h lead might not be so pleasant |pg||
nt|ady: may well be a swing for Netherlands|pg||
nt|szalay: in 4N|pg||
nt|haans: and clubs honors right|pg||
nt|sybarra: works on this hand |pg||
nt|sybarra: (maybe)|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: if you play strong 1N i|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: you probably will play there|pg||
nt|mcphee: lose 2@S 1@D 1@H|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i don't think EW pairs would have any difficulty to reach game|pg||
nt|haans: but what is trump|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: traffic light is red pays to be conservative|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh well what do I know |pg||
nt|haans: 4@H young bidding|pg||
nt|h_karluk: this time black Kings are not favorably placed|pg||
nt|daman: opposite a passed hand|pg||
nt|vbman: s better starts to finger the two of hearts|pg||
nt|poohbear: This is a typical problem hand. West has extras but cant show them without going past 3nt.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and i wonder alloted time for 10 boards|pg||
nt|pierced: 1@d with 8 points |pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: e-w gave them all the chance|pg||
nt|xenya: they might get to a hopeless slam now -- and they did|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 @S?  rkk ? |pg||
nt|szalay: u can beat 5@C if u play some special (lavinthal, roman) signal over A of @S|pg||
nt|haans: E dont fool me|pg||
nt|szalay: some specs asked why|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 5@D is makeable, this contract looks unlucky|pg||
nt|szalay: I think cause at Open this kinda toy isnt so dangerous|pg||
nt|szalay: in junior/female tourney 80% or more of the field unfamiliar with weak NT sys|pg||
nt|szalay: I think no pair in the World who wd play 5-3 minor-suit game instead of 5-3 major|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true |pg||
nt|daman: who simply raised|pg||
nt|haans: they have clubs you have points so play clubs|pg||
nt|mcphee: running the @C however will help|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that's a brave duck|pg||
nt|pierced: oh no 12 :)|pg||
nt|pierced: 1down like in 1NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: I think first step to trap was 1@H...after that they came deeper and deeper|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: seemed like a cuebid auction to me|pg||

nt|sybarra: this site has a picture of the beautiful facility at the White House |pg||

nt|othered1: penalty double of 1@D?  I'd be defending the third overtrick in 1@DXX if I tried that.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: WD|pg||
pc|dK|nt|sybarra: it is a reburbished tennis club,  (still active tennis courts)  and a wonder bridge facility |pg||
nt|chick: no club finesse necessary |pg||
nt|haans: but bid but|pg||
nt|haans: big|pg||
nt|haans: but agree a not needed jump|pg||
mc|13|nt|ady: yes agree should be 6 card suit  but AQ to 6 and 2 outside aces is top weight|pg||

nt|xenya: a few spectators think that 2NT was equivalent to the natural 3@S bid|pg||
nt|ritong: if it was, they rudely erred|pg||
nt|marlowepi: moreover, once NS started in the way that they did, one has to ask if they were likely to reach the grand even against silent foes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@S over 2@D would obviously not have shown the hand he had. Maybe it would have without interference|pg||
nt|xenya: perhaps N was not so sure|pg||
nt|cuttysark: It may well have been - but hard to bid a Grand when partner has concealed his 5 heart winners|pg||
nt|yuval10: even after 5@d S should bid 5NT or 6@d, not 6@s|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|Walddk2: Depends what 2NT showed|pg||

nt|szalay: it was an expensive count signal|pg||
nt|haans: slam?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Forget my 6 @D analize - I had only seen a 4-card @C at East|pg||
nt|szalay: btw Woolsey's policy is correct imho: if u have 5card suit: lead it, otherwise try to figure out pd's 5card|pg||

nt|petergill: 3@S was good bid - great cards - aces are wonderful. Low on points, high on tricks |pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: NS will make a lot of tricks here|pg||

mb|1C!|an|2+crd|nt|xenya: but E did bid 5@C -- seems that's what W was eager to hear|pg||

nt|po-s: alerted|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so far Fisher and Tarnovski showed nice performance|pg||

mb|3S|nt|haans: 4@S makes with @CK lead|pg||
nt|othered1: 3N?|pg||

mb|d|nt|sharkey: a + score is good here|pg||

nt|chick: @D7 = beer card ... http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_card|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like an easy game for EW here|pg||
nt|daman: now 3NT by NS unless North wants to convert|pg||
nt|haans: my votes for 2@Hx|pg||

nt|Walddk4: is easier|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 22-18 supposedly a part score|pg||
nt|mcphee: land in 2 or a major is my guess here|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i bid 2@@@c smolen here|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i cant see current standings on that website, am i missing something|pg||
nt|h_karluk: we have a 9 cards trump fit and i won't be ashamed when i discovered 4-0 break (10 %)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: we also have 5-1 @d and 6-1 break is 7 %, so interesting layout|pg||
nt|haans: on the strong side|pg||
nt|haans: sorry clubs 89 wrong|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: East alerts 2@D, and passes..|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Do you agree with 3@s on N now?|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/index.php?option=com_frontpage&Itemid=76  actually think this one is easier using left hand index |pg||
nt|haans: that overcall vul is WEAK|pg||
mb|4C|nt|szalay: I think a tipical mistake to correct in junior age by coach(es): stop slam-greedy|pg||
nt|sybarra: they keep skipping the @S suit, but it is 4333   |pg||
nt|szalay: the imp score is done for GAMES, from both directions|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 21/19 and North lonely cowboy now|pg||
nt|pelu: for me 1NT or 2Nt!|pg||
nt|haans: agree|pg||
nt|ady: would have tht 1NT better from north|pg||
nt|haans: 2@C not forcing|pg||
nt|szalay: that is the reason why in Hungary we tend NOT to lead 4card suit vs. 3N, rather "odd card major"|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: we'll see how low everyone can stay on this board... 3@c and 2M look to be the limits|pg||
nt|haans: that michaes not my cup|pg||
nt|xenya: N got somewhat greedy when he played a small diamond, allowing contract to make, in theory, and that resulted in 2 down  |pg||
nt|copeyj: N/S can make 3NT here I think - but Volcker decided to take his shot at defending|pg||
nt|marlowepi: a  lucky 3N|pg||
nt|sybarra: and an ugly on at that |pg||
nt|yo_yo: the strongest hand hasnt bid yet|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ssh, walls have ears Erwin, aren't we in same team :P|pg||
nt|pierced: 2@h?|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: and whichever suit you pick things not much easy |pg||
nt|sybarra: auction almost screams for major suit lead |pg||
nt|haans: spades not happy|pg||
nt|daman: good to see the players have some red cards in their bidding boxes|pg||
nt|sybarra: *one|pg||
nt|marlowepi: something like an 18% contract, but you just end up there after the normal opening by N|pg||
nt|h_karluk: seems declarer agreed with me|pg||
nt|yo_yo: stayman surely, not smolen|pg||
nt|haans: if they know what they are doing|pg||
nt|ritong: score corrected 11 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: 2@c now cbs- i suppose|pg||
nt|sharkey: NS past their comfort zone |pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: South explained when asked that 3@c shows a good hand|pg||
nt|sharkey: I like 1 NT instead of 3@C|pg||
nt|pelu: sh for sure be a 5 card suit|pg||
nt|frankaus: 4@D will make life difficult|pg||
nt|haans: not easy|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think experienced players would thank to 4@d overcall that alarmed about there's a highly distributional layout|pg||
nt|haans: agree|pg||
nt|haans: but what to lead|pg||
nt|frankaus: i like X here - (t/o) do something sensible |pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/index.php?option=com_frontpage&Itemid=76|pg||
nt|haans: to weak to bid to strong to pass|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: Huh?|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: 1N:15-17 now|pg||
nt|haans: often a make|pg||
nt|mcphee: many pairs play that 2@H now can be any 5-4 major hand|pg||
nt|h_karluk: just a joke|pg||
nt|xenya: not by my standards, but perhaps they treat it differently|pg||
nt|xenya: no, same way|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|vugraphzeg: south altered 2c, north didnt|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: alerted:)|pg||
nt|szalay: do they play with screens?|pg||
nt|szalay: what is the website of tourney? can u publish it?|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: yes|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=80&Itemid=72|pg||

nt|vugraphzeg: http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/ and http://www.bridge.nl/|pg||
nt|xenya: thanks Shirley|pg||
nt|xenya: and Jacco :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: Jacco's may be better |pg||
nt|sybarra: mine is participants I see |pg||
nt|szalay: in my book 3@D is NOT forcing, so dunno why West bid on|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Nort has just 5 losers, however no entry to table|pg||
nt|ady: get clubposition will  make life easy|pg||
nt|sybarra: website,  on left you can go to participants, scores etc  |pg||
nt|chick: 2N = unusual (minors in this case), but sacrificing VUL is usually dangerous, and E doesn't have enough for 4@C imo|pg||
nt|chick: and W is sucked in by E's bid to a very risky save|pg||
nt|hawe45:  West is socked in by his own 2 NT-bid - lacking 2-3 key-cards vulnerable|pg||
nt|hawe45:  sucked|pg||
nt|haans: @C) good|pg||
nt|haans: 9|pg||
nt|daman: what is their carding?|pg||
nt|haans: making it easy|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 3N is also making I suppose|pg||
nt|haans: nice|pg||
nt|xenya: it does -- on a @D finesse|pg||
nt|h_karluk: would i pass over 1@s ? :) obviously not, unless there is a very special agreement|pg||
nt|vbman: serious 3nt?|pg||
nt|haans: assume low positive|pg||
nt|haans: france did well here|pg||
pc|sA|nt|szalay: e-w has their 3rd dangerous bidding so far|pg||
nt|haans: i play 3@C as a prempt|pg||
nt|haans: many beginners believe all new suit bids are forcing even when reponers first say = have weak hand|pg||
nt|ady: diamond back best for now|pg||
nt|haans: standard for 2nt bid to be forcing nowdays|pg||
nt|daman: a spec says udca|pg||
nt|mcphee: N usually bidding 2@S now|pg||
nt|othered1: I don't know EW's overcalling style, but it was a non-space-consuming overcall, vulnerable|pg||
nt|pierced: robert is an activ player :)|pg||
pc|s7|nt|frankaus: put me down as a pass with Wests hand - aceless 4333 even with 14 i would pass|pg||
nt|szalay: double by South?|pg||
nt|ady: 2 spades and a club it seems|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i play as jump rebid|pg||
nt|haans: clubsa clubs and more clubs|pg||
nt|sybarra: lot of @D to negotiate |pg||
nt|h_karluk: could be, as a passed hand just showed his limit level|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and maybe that was a good reason to begin with a convention - the F******y|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Even green against red it is doubtful|pg||
nt|haans: some very young some not more than 25|pg||
pc|c9|nt|sybarra: welcoms Szalay |pg||
nt|ady: needs to cash club now|pg||
nt|szalay: normal bidding, normal contract, easy make|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 2@h also works - natural|pg||
nt|yuval10: with some overtricks|pg||
nt|pelu: Howard 8Australia) after same start bid 1Nt in N|pg||
nt|szalay: Brigitta became a bit pessimistic abroad|pg||
nt|szalay: so here @S lead for us...the best one|pg||
nt|szalay: @D fulfills it|pg||
nt|szalay: as bridgeplayer I wd like to watch @S lerad...as Hungarian @D:)|pg||
nt|szalay: lead|pg||
nt|daman: that was not a great switch|pg||
nt|haans: @C) = lavinthal|pg||
nt|haans: 9|pg||
nt|po-s: A bit lucky - to find South with the two minor queens|pg||
nt|haans: @h neutral so best|pg||
nt|po-s: if garbage stayman, 44 is enough|pg||
nt|yo_yo: so the Aussies now in action|pg||
nt|yo_yo: are they brothers?  brother and sister?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think NS adopted some sturdy program, i liked their strategy to win, just do not adventure. that's cool|pg||
nt|vbman: or unserious 3 nt|pg||
nt|vbman: some play it the other way |pg||
pc|c3|nt|sybarra: Jacco's first web site, you can see the beautiful facility |pg||
nt|szalay: he has 2 aces, pd had shown values, they bypassed 3n...SO|pg||
nt|rnmalik: good lead|pg||
nt|szalay: odd card major, u know:)|pg||
nt|szalay: but are few exceptions what I dont tell u know...we need some secret weapons:)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: so is @H in E:)|pg||
nt|szalay: unbid oddcard major, to be specific|pg||
nt|rnmalik: ok|pg||
nt|yuval10: red suit lead will give declarer his 9th trick, not that he can't develope one in @s anyway...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: interestingly, in 3N you want the club king onside, but in 5D you want the opening leader to have it:)|pg||
nt|mcphee: yes just try to get out of the crummy NT spot|pg||
nt|yo_yo: twins?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: brothers,  thanks|pg||
nt|yo_yo: in fact how many females are in this competition?|pg||
nt|mcphee: good lead this trump|pg||
nt|yo_yo: maybe the operator can tell us?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: opps have 6 cards in @h/@s suit, as expected 4-2  48%, so 2@s good choice while they had 5/2?|pg||
nt|po-s: it is called girls, not females|pg||
nt|mcphee: the point is they do not know for sure if @H is 5-2|pg||
nt|h_karluk: juniors|pg||
nt|po-s: Or possibly women|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think after 2@c it's guaranteed 5/4 weak|pg||
nt|yo_yo: most women arent offended by being called female, PO|pg||
nt|mcphee: using stayman in this fashion declarer may hold 5@S and 4@H even and a weak hand|pg||
nt|yo_yo: and girls , to my mind , grow to be women about the age of 18|pg||
nt|mcphee: as many treat 2@S in that sequence as invitational values|pg||
nt|mcphee: containng both majors|pg||
nt|h_karluk: okay, however when our Ladies team won we say wd girlz, and they say ty boyz :)|pg||
nt|mcphee: the only good thing about this hand is he is not down yet|pg||
nt|h_karluk: just curiosity, how come N neglected S is short in @s, could be void and bid twice to his pass while he has nice @c fit|pg||
nt|haans: now 4 clubs and maybe @DJ get a trick|pg||
nt|petergill: Scores after 21 rounds at http://www.nbbportal.nl/1003/ then click on Competitie then on White House Juniors in middle|pg||
pc|cT|nt|haans: with 4-2 draw trumfs and play nt|pg||
nt|chick: as a kib points out, E may want to double 4@S as well|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: quite the aggresive type of lady..|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: well, takes a @h lead to make 3N on the @d finesse|pg||
nt|yo_yo: he was clever|pg||
nt|yo_yo: he looked at the vulnerability|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://nbbuitslagen.transfer-solutions.com/uss/goPage30.do?rndid=74915&verid=805&start=21  for standings after 21 rounds|pg||
nt|petergill: Four teams only 8 VPS apart at the top - Israel, Australia 2nd, France and Italy 4th, several other teams close up too|pg||
nt|Walddk4: That's easier, Peter|pg||
nt|petergill: Thanks Roland|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: I made the classic mistake 4 and A|pg||
nt|szalay: hi all|pg||
nt|ady: hi|pg||
nt|sybarra: has to be careful now not to lose a @S |pg||
nt|rnmalik: hi and welcome|pg||
nt|haans: have x for mopre cards|pg||
nt|pelu: nu lead can defeat 3Nt - 3!X then u set up 3 @D-tricks = 9|pg||
nt|ady: with hearts 4-4  heart lead would not beat the contract  defence take 3 hearts and 1 diamond|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Facing a vulnerable 2 NT, East can only see 3 losers|pg||
pc|s9|nt|h_karluk: depends agreements just use 2@d or 2@h, and make things easier|pg||
nt|szalay: btw @H beats it as well|pg||
nt|rnmalik: It makes only on @D lead|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I mean as the cards are|pg||
nt|szalay: Hope can lead @S back, cause sure partner has T: otherwise declarer wd play small from dummy, probably|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: Hop asking questions about possible distribution|pg||
nt|szalay: some spec suggested @C lead is ok as well: to be honest I dont lead opps suit from Txx...NEVER|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: of declarer's hand|pg||
nt|szalay: declerer could have 4card @S|pg||
nt|szalay: his bid just denies 4card @H|pg||
nt|haans: now can raise hearts|pg||
nt|haans: no sry|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i can see ;6 tricks|pg||
nt|mcphee: low @C?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: mebbe i could never get an answer, just online..but i would ask this question to player if that was a face to face event|pg||
pc|sT|nt|szalay: to bid games, take tricks...and double games when they r in vuln and we see the chance|pg||
nt|sybarra: it is a reburbished tennis club (still active tennis courts) and quite a terrific bridge facility also |pg||
nt|haans: many  mean 3n to show two cards in opening suit|pg||
nt|yuval10: now only @h will limit declarer to 10|pg||
nt|daman: tempo is everything|pg||
nt|vbman: makes 5|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so far @d K favorably placed. no trump problem, and a working @c finesse|pg||
pc|c8|nt|h_karluk: 11-15 5@h+4@s stuff|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: made a mistake when correcting the first score|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: was 1 off|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: dummy is getting tapped, and this should be down one too many I believe|pg||
nt|yuval10: can make 10 now|pg||
nt|h_karluk: bear in mind both vul|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|yuval10: otherwise 12 tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like that, yes|pg||
nt|xenya: but this seems to give declarer a break|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ady: this not definately making from south's point of view|pg||
nt|ady: if south plays K@H now then will be much better placed|pg||
nt|szalay: do u see any reason for small @D?|pg||
nt|szalay: except blocking suit?|pg||
nt|szalay: and to give fals impression to pd?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  West might refret the small @D - but we do not know their methods|pg||
nt|szalay: I am informed Hungarian defender started @S as well|pg||
nt|szalay: he learnt his lesson well, wd:)|pg||
nt|szalay: I believe to lead small from Qx is technically bad|pg||
nt|szalay: when dummy has 76xx|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I agree adds to confusion for the P|pg||
nt|szalay: small @D back wd be a punishment...|pg||
nt|szalay: but:|pg||
nt|szalay: who has J of @S?|pg||
nt|szalay: surely West|pg||
nt|szalay: otherwise declarer wd play small, not Q|pg||
nt|szalay: at trick 1|pg||
nt|szalay: so @S is a 100% lead|pg||
nt|haans: back to teaching|pg||
nt|mcphee: not an easy defence really is it|pg||
nt|mcphee: low @C to J not a bad plan |pg||
pc|h3|nt|h_karluk: everything is on the right spot for NS|pg||
nt|haans: we have all seen better defense|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and North should see there's likely no more than a trick in @c suit|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so far i found N has interesting hand evaluation ideas|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|szalay: I was there..in February..I remember was terrible cold and windy|pg||
nt|haans: say ty opps|pg||
nt|ady: but east can get 2 spade ruffs|pg||
nt|pelu: yes: @Sk - @s ruff - @c to A and @S ruff|pg||
nt|haans: to strong for flannery|pg||
nt|yuval10: by guessing @s, which isn't such a big guess...|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|ady: K@S   spade ruff   then trump back and another spade ruff|pg||
pc|cK|nt|daman: the @C 9  and @D 6 seem to be suit preference for @Ss :)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|h_karluk: i think Bobby Goldman described well what to do in his book Aces Scientific with 5/4 or 5/5 weak/strong M holdings|pg||
nt|vbman: l dont want to be an italian junior|pg||
pc|d4|nt|h_karluk: maybe the software allows you to correct it anytime, i think Roland is good at that|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: could S maybe chuck the Q@C on the king?|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: needs partner to have all the intermediate clubs though|pg||
nt|h_karluk: plus @h honour cards good enough to resist|pg||
nt|haans: diamond ruff 1 down|pg||
nt|yo_yo: he needs a @D ruff|pg||
nt|othered1: Nice position for defense|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|h_karluk: to me ideal F-----y|pg||
nt|sybarra: should be fairly certain now that spdes are 3/3|pg||
nt|haans: Poland takes the lead|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ady: now making 11|pg||
nt|rnmalik: as the cards we see +1 now|pg||
nt|h_karluk: because the hand does not contain reverse values|pg||
nt|chick: well, they may get out for down only 1|pg||
nt|po-s: this was a bad plan since now defenders won´t have a problem....shouldn´t|pg||
pc|dA|nt|vbman: who is anticipated to follow the best history of bridge|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ady: sorry  Peter you were first|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: Bas van Beijsterveldt helped me :)|pg||

nt|haans: Hi Erwin|pg||
nt|frankaus: will make 12 i expect|pg||
nt|haans: decl do not know how to play @H|pg||
nt|po-s: North should have a pretty good club suit after his spade bid|pg||
nt|xenya: yes -- and N gets another chance|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: claimed too early|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: quite messy at the table |pg||
pc|d7|nt|yo_yo: could you be thinking of hand 1?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: commentated for this one |pg||
pc|d5|pc|d6|nt|pelu: normal u dont give distribution i trumf, but here it would help W if he know that pd has even No|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|haans: nice fighting|pg||
pc|c5|nt|haans: and loses it|pg||
nt|sybarra: and about to be well done by declarer?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|sybarra: easy now |pg||
nt|hawe45:  West should know, that when declarer plays @S Queen from dummy, East PROBABLY has the 10!|pg||
nt|tomi2: thinking here just makes you angry if you lose the imp if finesse is working, but he will take the ace anyway|pg||
nt|petergill: good defence I think|pg||
pc|s8|nt|mcphee: @H now is a killer|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|h_karluk: push next board please|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c7|nt|h_karluk: enters to table with a @c - pitches 2 @h loser, that's al folks|pg||
nt|sybarra: that J of @D may score yet|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: West asking something now...|pg||
nt|haans: they want tell :)|pg||
nt|othered1: I wonder what he thought to ask|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
pc|d8|nt|szalay: Israel is slow starter: they missed a so-so slam after agressive slamtry, bid a (nearly) hopeless one...and bid terrible game, where only good news it wasnt double|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: http://www.vkblog.nl/blog/3052/Bridgenieuws some impressions from the pro am yesterday. Esp interesting for the dutch viewers|pg||
nt|szalay: d|pg||
nt|chick: or not :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  In 3 @C they would|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|haans: and got it|pg||
pc|c2|nt|VugraphPl1: 75%|pg||
nt|ritong: since east did not lead a top @s, either they are 4/3 or they block  thus @d hook was "safe"|pg||
pc|s2|nt|haans: dead now|pg||
nt|po-s: had been more fun perhaps - if North had continued with a club after the HA|pg||
nt|sybarra: :(|pg||
pc|d9|nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh well |pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: sorry, i lost it somewhere|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jcwla: Meanwhile, N/S avoided any danger of getting too high - though @DK onside would have made slam.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ady: down 1|pg||
nt|daman: he played this OK under the circumstances|pg||
nt|sybarra: some days you just get lucky |pg||
nt|marlowepi: N is happy that the bad game makes, but undoubtedly aware he cannot expect a swing|pg||
pc|h6|nt|tomi2: its just to say later "i knew better, but i prefered to take 600 safe"|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|h2|pc|s6|pc|h8|pc|hK|pg||
pc|dK|nt|h_karluk: counted nine to bring the contract home? |pg||

nt|haans: hurray|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|sJ|pc|h9|pg||
nt|petergill: although ducking @DK was not so great, it gave declarer a chance to make|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: It does depend whether you are playing with or without trump...|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: with @c Jxx, i think north should not act again|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ritong: since it makes it close to impossible pard has a penalty pass|pg||
pc|s4|nt|Walddk2: After this match they will break for dinner. Last match at 19.00 local time, in 1 hour and 25 minutes|pg||

nt|h_karluk: esp when u r a passed hand|pg||
nt|yuval10: indeed, 2@c is invitational |pg||
nt|h_karluk: i agree with 3@c rebid, invite or better, i can live with that 5 losers, no matter entry to table, i know no need to cry when they sets, favorable vuln was another tempting factor|pg||
nt|haans: right u r|pg||
nt|haans: not bad|pg||
nt|pelu: west has a 5 loser-hand - and his pd has 0 tricks for him! :(|pg||
nt|szalay: rehi|pg||
nt|ady: west may open some sort of weak 2|pg||
nt|daman: they should gain at least 3 IMPs    800 was there for the taking|pg||
nt|haans: @C9 acceptable of play low enc|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: so George, which contract will we end up (doubled) in now?|pg||
nt|daman: @D Ace was fatal|pg||
nt|daman: hhrrrmmmm|pg||
nt|po-s: ow THIS is what bI ncall a Michaels - if West had opened|pg||
nt|haans: all the way|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: Bessis is laughing about the pass of his partner|pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry meant 3/2,  obviously early in morning for me |pg||
nt|haans: easy make :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: a tough contract|pg||
nt|mcphee: do you think he was lucky to escape for 1 down?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: previous board 2@h met same destiny|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes i think so|pg||
nt|mcphee: me too|pg||
nt|yo_yo: I didnt forsee that 2nd @D trick|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 25-15 now we may see a game try|pg||
nt|h_karluk: very little possibility that he was not sure for 5@c nonvul then preferred 3@s x -2 in vuln|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 25-25 therem who knows NS would try something smart|pg||
nt|yo_yo: well it paid to be cautious in the  bidding there   WD Wiankowski|pg||
nt|haans: instructing deal|pg||
nt|sybarra: probably should never had the 10 of @D in declarer's hand  |pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: commentators curse strikes immediatly:(|pg||
nt|ady: re|pg||
nt|szalay: but East knew J of @S for sure|pg||
nt|haans: 4@H?|pg||
nt|daman: no doubled contracts this time|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 26 vs 14, could be interesting board|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but the aussies missed a chance|pg||
nt|sybarra: might bang down from the top |pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: Lotan doesn't understand it, and says it was easy|pg||
nt|petergill: i think the reason declarer rejected the obvious play of @H to Q at Trick 2, ruff a spade, club to ten is that it seems to only ever lead to 9 tricks. |pg||
mb|1D|nt|yuval10: if he wasn't passed hand then 2@d would've been GF|pg||
nt|pierced: 2@d |pg||
mb|2C|nt|szalay: in that case I wd go out for water, to refresh myself|pg||
nt|ady: an easy 3NT  played by south|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes|pg||
nt|sharkey: E has the "perfect" Dbl hand|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 23-17 this time, another interesting board|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: they even played after the claim..|pg||
nt|szalay: Frenchmen are very conservative with 4card other major|pg||
nt|ady: at least 10 tricks in hearts for e/w|pg||
nt|ady: west decided not to open|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Also, yes|pg||
nt|szalay: logic is more important than defence agreements|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: 4@s?|pg||
nt|daman: I might have to eat my words :)|pg||
nt|daman: yes|pg||
nt|haans: yes full standard|pg||
nt|sybarra: great slam here |pg||
nt|haans: good 3@H|pg||
nt|mcphee: pretty easy 4@H here|pg||
nt|othered1: that's a friendly partner for you|pg||
nt|haans: old Baron style|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: He told it when the screen was closed again|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: can they make 6@D|pg||
nt|vbman: tx|pg||
nt|pierced: will be the contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: uh oh. 1@s ? hmmm :)|pg||
nt|pelu: his problem was the 4 card @s|pg||
nt|ady: west wasting no time  4@D  is for hearts|pg||
nt|szalay: I agree with xfer to 4@H: IF we have weak 6card and strong 4card major, kinda stayman is preferred|pg||
nt|szalay: in Hungary we had a 1st class teacher/player in 60s, called Lajos Widder|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 2NT in N for minor|pg||
nt|szalay: his favourite proverb was: "I hate maths...only important thing is: all players has 13 cards and all color has 13"|pg||
nt|daman: I must admit    I would have bid 2@H with the West hand|pg||
nt|haans: both makes|pg||
nt|daman: 1@S seemed timid|pg||
nt|chick: too strong for Michaels|pg||
nt|daman: no way|pg||
nt|chick: 1@S, then 2@D shows the hand much better|pg||
nt|haans: best is 5@H now|pg||
nt|daman: classic Michaels|pg||
nt|h_karluk: kinda cake and walk|pg||
nt|haans: baron 1nt from the 40th|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: 3 NT|pg||
nt|copeyj: great grand|pg||
nt|haans: many play X showing minimum|pg||
nt|mcphee: oh some relay hand type with 2@C|pg||
nt|h_karluk: likely S will dictate for 4@h|pg||
nt|othered1: is there a strength limit, up or down, to south's 1N?|pg||
nt|haans: weakish|pg||
nt|haans: double with stronger hand|pg||
nt|petergill: Even 2@C looks like going down, if the defence is good. |pg||
pc|d4|nt|szalay: terrible slam, imho|pg||
nt|rnmalik: a @C can be pitched on @S but they dont know:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: likely to play 2 @H's here|pg||
nt|szalay: in Hungary we play Michaels a bit different way than World do|pg||
nt|szalay: NOT weak or strong, rather "at least inv values, no upper limit"|pg||
nt|haans: gazzilli|pg||
nt|haans: anything but 2@D is weak|pg||
nt|sybarra: a grand even but is it biddable  (7 @D?)|pg||
nt|othered1: where does this hand fall in their range, do you think?|pg||
nt|haans: 12 13 max 14|pg||
nt|othered1: so this is way below maximum|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: 1NT=7-12|pg||
nt|h_karluk: NS losers are 2@h, 1@d and a @s, they have 23 hcp, let's see their best|pg||
pc|dK|nt|szalay: dont they play Drury?|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: During the white house juniors very nice weather last few years|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: Dennis Bilde had his moment on the first board. now 1 highpoint average over 3|pg||
nt|haans: best game 3nt but ...|pg||
nt|szalay: Lazar could NOT bid 3@D as P/C, cause its inv with @S|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i guess W accept invitation, wldn't decline|pg||
nt|yo_yo: well stopped by NS  |pg||
pc|dA|nt|frankaus: water? - do u know what fish do in water :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: those hands are usually easy to bid :)|pg||
nt|ady: natural    should have had a 5th club|pg||
nt|haans: no way to show @D :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: how about pass :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: he already had 3@c in his hand..|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: practically|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Yes - E/W need a quiet board|pg||
nt|szalay: I think South's hand is close to 2N, imho|pg||
nt|daman: hard to bid 2@D over 3@H|pg||
nt|chick: Michaels is a preemptive bid, he does not need to preempt|pg||
nt|haans: 3@H usually no defensive tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: so 3@D is natural and weak?|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: yes|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 2@s would show a non-constructive raise I suppose, so he has to bid 3@d. N can now bid 4@h which will be corrected to 4@s and that should be the final contract|pg||
nt|haans: yep 2@D is GF|pg||
nt|haans: if p is strong|pg||
nt|haans: any bid now strong hand|pg||
nt|copeyj: 7NT on ice - and they will bid it no problem|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes 7 mnt also |pg||
nt|copeyj: when south gets to ask for aces|pg||
nt|haans: rkc show @DQ and off|pg||
nt|marlowepi: generally disappointing to be in 4th seat when holding a hand like N, but here she gets to bid before EW have shown spades anyway|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: I have there system notes here, but needed to look it up :)\|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|ady: kibs asking 6@D      can make    but bad contract  |pg||
nt|h_karluk: no way|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: but last moment rethink :P|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No - Jacks are doubtful values and 3-3-3-4|pg||
nt|daman: michaels is a descriptive bid    doesn't have to be preemptive at all|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: what a sad way to end a bidding|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 3@d is the worst thing Adam can hear, maybe 3@h is even enough|pg||
nt|po-s: 2spades would not be constructive at all|pg||
nt|haans: 3@S slaminvite?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: agrees @H probably|pg||
nt|xenya: 3N is makeable but hard to get their intellligently|pg||
nt|xenya: *there|pg||
nt|petergill: North has to decide who has the singleton and who has three @d's|pg||
nt|petergill: As East has longer clubs than South, East is favourite to have the shorter @ds|pg||
pc|sT|nt|szalay: I think 9 hcp with ruffing values is more than regular 10 hcp|pg||
nt|ady: 2@S  2nd negative|pg||
nt|pelu: great bid!|pg||
nt|haans: clubs lead ?|pg||
nt|szalay: I think 6@C is very optimistic, especially in all white|pg||
nt|szalay: all white is NOT a position where u need be greedy|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|chick: that's the normal way to play it ... preemptive or 18+ ... but of course you can do as you like :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Do you get a bonus when you have 14 top tricks?|pg||
nt|sybarra: and "flops" well as Henri would say |pg||
nt|haans: easiest grand in a long time|pg||
nt|copeyj: he will be able to count 12 tops|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3nt is far easier on that board|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i suppose 4@S would be defeated? |pg||
nt|yo_yo: but if they dont cash out  the @H can be set up|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 2x2 m losers|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes must be slam invite|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Ed Shapiro|pg||
nt|haans: on the weak side|pg||
nt|othered1: very easy, maybe too easy, plus here|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|szalay: likely 11 tricks, next one|pg||
nt|ady: trump switch  will hold to 10|pg||
nt|marlowepi: many would bid 4H nonvul since EW have not found their spades yet|pg||
nt|yo_yo: here we go|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|rnmalik: agree was an observation|pg||
nt|pelu: 9½ out of 10 will lead @S|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|pelu: ½ lead @d! :)|pg||
nt|ady: natrual spade lead 9 tricks    this likely to be a swing for Australia|pg||
nt|Walddk4: All results (including butlers and hand records) at www.nbbportal.nl/1003/ > 'competitie'|pg||
nt|szalay: r u sure?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No intermediats|pg||
nt|rnmalik: N found no defense to 5@H and has settled for -2 as we see|pg||
nt|chick: I wonder what the difference between that sequence and 1N 3N is|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like 3NT has 9 tricks via 3@s , 2@h, 2@d and 2@c|pg||
nt|xenya: this rates to make  think|pg||
nt|haans: my guess 2@S 2nt replacement|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, Hans|pg||
nt|copeyj: and his part must have osmething extra for 15-17|pg||
nt|vbman: lets see if they venture for something higher|pg||
nt|vbman: completing the picture|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|szalay: important thing after bad boards: leave table for a while and reconnect:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: All Israels I know play drury, maybe west didnt think his hand was good enough\|pg||
nt|ady: club lead will need spades 3-3 to pitch losing club   and heart lead will need king well placed|pg||
nt|sybarra: wrongsided this one|pg||
nt|frankaus: 3nt will make with the   @HJshort|pg||
nt|pelu: no|pg||
nt|szalay: trump LEAD does it|pg||
nt|ady: sorry   meant trump lead|pg||
nt|szalay: cause North could lead 2nd one|pg||
nt|szalay: I think to lead trump is close to suiced from South's seat|pg||
nt|rnmalik: and no DBL|pg||
nt|szalay: of course, it could make for 3-3 @S, but: in that case 5@HX is at least 500, can be 800|pg||
nt|szalay: I dont like to save|pg||
nt|szalay: I like when WE score|pg||
nt|haans: direct 5@H more angry|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and maybe natural way was easy to reach 4@h |pg||
nt|yo_yo: dont think!|pg||
pc|s9|nt|Walddk4: He will get @CK after 5NT now and can count 13|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: Thomas came here yesterday, from Reno, and he had to go with plane to Paris and then with Train here... |pg||
nt|mcphee: n/s will need to grab those tricks or possible they will go away|pg||
nt|mcphee: uh oh|pg||
nt|jcwla: That problem solved...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: friendly neighbor lead. solved 2 way finesse problem quickly|pg||
nt|h_karluk: N already limitted his hand, not hard for S to guess rest|pg||
nt|vbman: 3h shows some h tolerance?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|haans: weak responder 2 jacks|pg||
nt|haans: easy to raise @D|pg||
nt|xenya: this may be a swing as pass by W over 1N is a fair option|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|xenya: not for juniors perhaps though|pg||
nt|daman: http://www.bridgeguys.com/Conventions/MichaelsCuebid.html|pg||
nt|po-s: Did I forget system now ? what has he shown???|pg||
nt|mcphee: E has pushed the envelope|pg||
nt|h_karluk: uh oh seems W's 3@s caused some misunderstanding there|pg||
nt|ritong: @c is the only possible suit to lead, though|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, everyone|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hi ed|pg||
nt|sybarra: gm Ed |pg||
nt|haans: Hi Ed|pg||
pc|s2|nt|vugraphzeg: kleine kamer|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think an imaginary problem there : say east has AQ96-KT983-7-J42, okay guys, would bid 1@h or still double over 1@d? my opinion : if East wld X with that  hand then 2@d cue by W ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: gr8 :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: Probably take @C finesse and end up with 11 tricks|pg||
nt|szalay: and his pd has strong hand: give her the last decision:)|pg||
nt|haans: they have a diamond loser|pg||
nt|haans: i think 2@S had been a better bid|pg||
nt|po-s: nor is any bid except 2D - except possibly in some partnerships: 2H|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: right, I meant like xxx xxx KQxx xxx or something|pg||
nt|haans: well 3@D did say no slam today|pg||
nt|vbman: so an action is sensible|pg||
nt|h_karluk: S can afford to concede 2 @h trick |pg||
nt|haans: that slaminvite risky|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|daman: it's all in there|pg||
nt|yo_yo: what system do they play?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that's the question|pg||
nt|mcphee: what ever it is someone bid too mcuh|pg||
nt|ritong: since opponents have at least a four carder in the three others|pg||
nt|petergill: and if South had short @d's, that would leave a lot of spades for South|pg||
pc|cA|nt|vugraphzeg: oops that was personal|pg||
nt|ady: clubs blocked fortunately|pg||
nt|sybarra: so you get lucky sometimes |pg||
nt|ady: east condiering unblocking  hoping 10@C with west|pg||
nt|h_karluk: with that junk even they show me full hands i could not dare to land 3@c|pg||
nt|haans: @CJ not cover not two entries to dummy|pg||
nt|copeyj: Volcker didnt bother|pg||
nt|haans: i say flat board|pg||
nt|copeyj: grand likely to be laydown, and very few hands from north could make it a bad grand i guess|pg||
nt|po-s: It seems Thomas has travelled the world - he has forgotten that in France it is forbidden to open 1NT with a 5card major|pg||
nt|copeyj: guillotine offence isn't it, Po?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Not among juniors, PO|pg||
nt|sybarra: must be only in france, no 5 card majors in 1 nt?|pg||
nt|po-s: T plays with his dad mostly, don´t forget|pg||
nt|sybarra: if he opens 1 @S, doesnt have a good rebid |pg||
nt|haans: in sweden we have had 5c M for 60 years in 1nt|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Worst case scenario is @CQJ, @HJ and @SJ|pg||
nt|yo_yo: and has West shown a NT shape?|pg||
pc|c8|nt|chick: lack of intermediates is what I see as the big problem -- half of S's hand is 5 or below|pg||
nt|Walddk4: And then the grand still has play|pg||
nt|h_karluk: dangerous height|pg||
pc|c2|nt|po-s: probably the Hockey club|pg||
nt|mcphee: :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 2@c+1@d obvious losers|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and leader has not much difficulty to cash|pg||
nt|mcphee: S has no other defence than to cash out really|pg||
nt|yo_yo: well i wondered when Kopecky reached that game earlier, if they would over reach soon|pg||
nt|h_karluk: say N has side suit values as opener|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ruffing potential extra power|pg||
nt|sybarra: interesting club pips |pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|h_karluk: likely 10 IMPs|pg||
nt|h_karluk: why not a @s ? yr long suit, declarer could have gaps there |pg||
nt|h_karluk: pitching a @d seems reasonable now, serves to ruff in th future|pg||
nt|petergill: I think North did well not to falsecard with @C9|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|VugraphPl1: http://michzimny.pl/bridge/2010/pila/gp.html|pg||
nt|ady: back to 10 maybe|pg||
nt|szalay: why @D?|pg||
nt|xenya: same 9 tricks in 2@D|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ady: good play that unforunately gets no reward|pg||
nt|sybarra: valiant try |pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: both north and south complimented east|pg||
nt|sharkey: I wud bid 1@H|pg||
nt|haans: me 2|pg||
nt|hawe45:  North now asks himself: WHY did I take that trick?|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, declarer can't set up the long suit, so he should take Yuval's line|pg||
nt|xenya: and that's what he is doing it seems|pg||
nt|mcphee: this seems to be E being a bit too pushy I think|pg||
nt|po-s: If I bid four suits, of course I have a four-suited hand|pg||
nt|yo_yo: I guess Nabil will realise he has 3 tricks|pg||
nt|h_karluk: another interesting point, East had a chance to read W's length, say A att, K count in their sys card and std methods|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so controls minor attacks|pg||
nt|yo_yo: well partner could be max|pg||
nt|haans: once in 100|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i like that 5 card suit|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ady: yes|pg||
nt|szalay: its risky|pg||
nt|szalay: @C/@S is sure exit|pg||
nt|rnmalik: flat board|pg||
nt|szalay: when we need just 1 trick to set: lead safe is a basic rule|pg||
nt|szalay: just interchange Q and J of @D why was it terrible try|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so new score after this board expected as 23-0|pg||
nt|vbman: need to ruff|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so that matters, 1@h just F1 fine|pg||
nt|haans: but how to get it|pg||
nt|ritong: it happens that east showed length in it|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and west refused to support|pg||
nt|ritong: then what?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: could transfer the ruff|pg||
nt|sybarra: better for poker maybe |pg||
nt|yo_yo: however partner wasnt max so they stayed low|pg||
pc|s8|nt|h_karluk: i meant in @d suit|pg||
nt|yo_yo: North isnt trying!|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but  he can see his contract   i suppose|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @h J favorably placed as an insurance in case they landed as Vladimir pointed out|pg||
pc|s7|nt|sharkey: Think better let @C9 run as N pegged with @CA|pg||
nt|haans: or transfer bids|pg||
nt|haans: let overcaller lead :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: next...|pg||
nt|haans: best with void opps can not count their tricks|pg||
nt|marlowepi: on this deal 4HX would go for too much though|pg||
nt|ritong: the target in no trump is to establish long winners, mind you|pg||
nt|othered1: as cards lie, trump back looks like only chance to limit declarer's tricks.  but that's to beat 4, not 2|pg||
nt|petergill: the falsecard @C9 might help West get the trumps right|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: east you mean|pg||
pc|d6|nt|Walddk4: Nah|pg||
nt|h_karluk: well, still 2 clubs losers, but who knows East may play another @h and N claims|pg||
nt|petergill: Best not ro "ruff air" with a trump winner|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: I can't claim before they do|pg||
nt|pelu: we have a real top-match on here: France 1 = No 2 (126 VP after 6 matches) and NL Blue No 3 (113)|pg||
pc|cT|nt|szalay: after this bidding trump lead is nearly automatic, imho|pg||
nt|tomi2: leading away from @SA here just gives away the tempr|pg||
pc|h7|nt|haans: had no reason to play @CK|pg||
nt|haans: 1 clubs loser deep finesse|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 10-13|pg||
pc|d2|nt|chick: and I quote:  " the accepted point count should be between 5 high card points and 11 high card points, although the strength is again a matter of the partnership agreement."|pg||
nt|h_karluk: no tranportation problem there|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|szalay: but Aces ar Aces:)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But you will find many 15/16 HCP-hands, who are stronger|pg||
pc|hA|nt|h_karluk: sorry |pg||
pc|h2|nt|h_karluk: oh transpopsed, declarer claims after ruffs a @h|pg||
nt|h_karluk: *transportation|pg||
pc|h4|nt|frankaus: another hand where after pd opens i would find it hard to stay out of game|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hQ|pc|h6|nt|xenya: the defence can't establish enought tricks, so declarer can develop slow tricks at his leisure|pg||
nt|h_karluk: could not see that line at the table, shldn't cost anything|pg||
nt|ralfwil: As I see it - N has shown @sAK and @hAj so @cA must be on W|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|chick: so if you want to argue that he had a good 11, I suppose you can consider you win this debate, but I still think it was too strong :)|pg||
nt|daman: By unfavorable vulnerability, the minimum high card points should be somewhat higher and stronger in honors.|pg||
nt|petergill: North is endplayed, just -1|pg||
nt|haans: and endplay|pg||

nt|szalay: routine 3N/5@C|pg||
nt|pelu: and also 3Nt in board 2|pg||
nt|sybarra: e/w can make a lot of hts here|pg||
nt|hawe45:  and they wiol get 450|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Not @D 7 - 7 @D|pg||
nt|hawe45:  but only 12 tricks|pg||

nt|haans: very god 11|pg||
nt|haans: 13 14 in my book|pg||
nt|chick: and since this was not unfavorable vulnerability ... :)|pg||
nt|haans: fast play|pg||
nt|sybarra: when you get past 13.....claim |pg||
nt|po-s: Hamdi, imps go to the team that wins the board|pg||
nt|h_karluk: truce :)|pg||
nt|haans: missed game|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: EW fighting for some reason|pg||
nt|othered1: not that I'd expect that to be bid.  Needs very friendly lie|pg||
nt|pierced: for not , hands arent very interesting|pg||
nt|xenya: ruff, draw and claim |pg||
nt|pierced: now*|pg||
nt|yuval10: maybe now a little bit more|pg||
nt|h_karluk: maybe preempts would decide to winner|pg||
nt|haans: got @CJ instead|pg||
nt|petergill: Yes, East, although Juzz Howard West would like to declare every hand if he could. |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: yes|pg||
nt|po-s: overtricks?|pg||
nt|haans: will 6@S work|pg||
nt|sybarra: need to get a breath of fresh air maybe,  on the beautiful paito |pg||
mb|1C!|an|2+|nt|ady: 20-20 again|pg||
nt|yuval10: S will be surprised to see his P opening|pg||
nt|h_karluk: just hook @h K and have fun|pg||
nt|szalay: I wd use exclusion RKC after xfer by South: 4@D-4@H-4@S/N (depends on RKC-style)|pg||
nt|h_karluk:  3 S had 0, now E has 1|pg||
nt|ady: 20-20 |pg||
nt|ady: however Netherlands got the 7 imps back hand 2  geting to game  where France stopped in 2NT|pg||
nt|daman: duh|pg||
nt|mcphee: well smashing 5@D looked like a good idea at the time for E I suppose:)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that's a shame for the Czechs  |pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think EW wld pop-up to 3N|pg||
nt|tomi2: he hoped to find partner on 4 clubs and set up a trick there... but i think he will never think of this leading problem again|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @S earned Oz, 4 imps|pg||
nt|othered1: anyone respond with north hand, vul?|pg||
nt|othered1: Some say never to pass with 5-card major.  I'd pass.|pg||
nt|yuval10: EW can actually make some game here|pg||
nt|pierced: in OR they will open 2@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzeg: south had 1 on 4 aswell and 2 on 2|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but a shot in the arm for the Aussies|pg||
mb|1S|an|.|nt|h_karluk: pass by E?|pg||
nt|haans: agree with that pass|pg||
nt|szalay: btw I wd bid 3N immediately here: dont give them chance for right lead |pg||
nt|szalay: slam is very unlikely|pg||
nt|ady: n/s haved a choice   5@C  or 3NT     3NT scores better|pg||
nt|pelu: the 8. @C is the key-card for direct 3Nt - u dont need an H in @C from pd|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @S-lead might bring 480|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No...|pg||
nt|szalay: it requires a perfect sys and silent opps to bid it|pg||
nt|hawe45:  So am I - no double is OK|pg||
nt|szalay: 6+5+2=13|pg||
nt|haans: all jumps are not weak :)|pg||
nt|daman: on with the show|pg||
nt|copeyj: normal 4@S here for N/S|pg||
nt|copeyj: wonder what thomas will chose|pg||
nt|sybarra: think I will stay in 4 and hope for the OT|pg||
nt|haans: vul but off u go|pg||
nt|h_karluk: olperator, what's the alert please? any explanation|pg||
nt|jcwla: A predictable gain (9) to Israel on 11 -- they played 3@SX-1 in OR.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: decent 11 at S|pg||
nt|haans: does Fisher know what 2@H mean?|pg||
nt|pierced: it will be hard for lhuissier to fing the lead here|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: easy to get -800|pg||
nt|mcphee: i think I might well take a swing at 5@D also|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Kopecky will be bent on revenge and might well double them also|pg||
nt|yo_yo: East is worth a try with 18 count|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: 2nt is weak with diamonds says north so they know what they are doiing|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i am not a fan of opening balanced 11 counts however|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
mb|2C|nt|ady: e/w have 9 tricks in spades as they lay|pg||
nt|yuval10: indeed, if 4@s is exclusion |pg||
nt|szalay: bid 6 or 7 depends on answer|pg||
nt|sharkey: Wonder if S knows what to do with all the points  - he'll probably drop stiff @SK to maje 4@S|pg||
nt|sharkey: *make|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and that's 10 boards sets, presumably predealt hands|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think that's wild|pg||
nt|sharkey: S may raise...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think i wld bid 3@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: he did, west goes into the tank now|pg||
nt|haans: west  do not promise @SK|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i dislike 3@d with 16 there|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - Vul at IMPs think it's right|pg||
nt|pelu: 2Nt = I can help in @c|pg||
nt|pelu: what can S bid now ? X for @S-stop?|pg||
nt|ady: not sure it right to settle for 3NT  switch K@D with A! north and west  then 6@C makes and 3NT down 1|pg||
nt|ady: k@D   and A@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: double on 2@S? Would  anybody else do that?|pg||
nt|ady: no   |pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: maybe my question also gives my opinion :)|pg||
nt|pelu: no X - in my book 5-card - or very strong 4-card suit - u can exp that pd bid 4@S over 3NT|pg||
nt|haans: stay low here|pg||
nt|haans: look 2+ is ALERTED all to learn|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: not alerted by Adam by the way.. but then again, he has so many|pg||
nt|haans: :) most forget it|pg||
nt|haans: going slamming|pg||
nt|copeyj: 4@C = shortage in @C game values 4@S|pg||
nt|h_karluk: with @s stoppers, picked his natural way|pg||
nt|jcwla: Back in a bit.|pg||
nt|ritong: 3@h looks correct|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i guess N would winds up with 3N|pg||
nt|ritong: leaving several options open, including 6@d|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: sorry was a misclick|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: trash Stayman|pg||
nt|copeyj: wont make Volcker excited|pg||
nt|h_karluk: thank you|pg||
nt|haans: very few juniors play walsh trf|pg||
nt|haans: but here is one|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Wud you pass and hope they land in NT?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: thanks Dennis :)|pg||
nt|haans: but give east a @D ruff then...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: now i pass to 4@d|pg||
nt|sharkey: After 1 NT opening West likely to be on lead anyway|pg||
nt|haans: and they are non vul|pg||
nt|pelu: I am with u Tim|pg||
nt|szalay: 2N: 14+, bal|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Yes - back to my first view|pg||
nt|szalay: 2@D was nat and GF|pg||
nt|xenya: NS might get in trouble now|pg||
nt|yuval10: 3@d by N perhaps?|pg||
nt|haans: 2@H = strong hand|pg||
nt|henryb:  pass perhaps?|pg||
nt|xenya: but just might -- N can rebid @Ds and S should pass|pg||
nt|haans: intermediate?|pg||
nt|copeyj: I am amazed Volcker has cue bid|pg||
nt|copeyj: he has nothing in partner's primary suit|pg||
nt|copeyj: he has a terrible holding in the splinter suit|pg||
nt|haans: spade 4-1 i say a killer |pg||
nt|copeyj: and he only has 4 trumps|pg||
nt|copeyj: North is pretty minimum, but he does have the nuts in controls|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W can;t be too comfortable doubling on that hand, but pass is too dangerous|pg||
nt|mcphee: oh my|pg||
nt|haans: hard to sea a slam now|pg||
nt|yuval10: if E bid 3NT then S will have to find the @d lead|pg||
nt|ralfwil: after the @s finess E cannot make|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@S = 6-10, no 4 card major or diamonds or 13+ no 4 card major bal|pg||
nt|petergill: they play transfer responses to 1@C|pg||
nt|ralfwil: even if he han played on @cKx|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@C natural, minimum|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: to stay at the table is a bad habit..I think no kinda rule in bridge|pg||
nt|szalay: if North says 3@D exclusion RKC could help...and later a grand slamtry:|pg||
nt|haans: normal opening bid?|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: no, 2@h is weak, but with partner who passed it can still be strongish|pg||
nt|haans: ok ok|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 22-18 obligatory pass by S|pg||
nt|mcphee: it is often bad to pass with 5 trumps|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i've not a small doubt that they know what they are doing, however alert box was empty and tried to get your help|pg||
nt|h_karluk: now, maybe @d lead by N and then N would try to find safe discards|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 4@C i prefer|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i pass|pg||
pc|h5|nt|haans: 2@H help me now|pg||
nt|ady: west trying to scramble to a better spot|pg||
nt|szalay: North wd accept with source of tricks, for sure|pg||
nt|szalay: I dunno why to ask stopper with QJx|pg||
nt|haans: rite u r|pg||
nt|daman: maybe a low intermediate|pg||
nt|daman: 10-13|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: brave man|pg||
nt|h_karluk: you know what they say when the home road is apparent just drive there|pg||
nt|h_karluk: EW 25, NS 15 @d lead makes things more interesting|pg||
nt|xenya: impossible|pg||
nt|pierced: will be easier in OR with 2@d open|pg||
nt|yuval10: quite reasonably, he didn't find it|pg||
nt|yuval10: and now 12 tricks possible for declarer|pg||
nt|xenya: can't avoid taking the lot|pg||
pc|h4|nt|VugraphPl1: sorry|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like a misunderstanding here|pg||
nt|sharkey: 4@D is crazy ....|pg||
nt|haans: wd|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think one should double when he/she's sure for -2|pg||
nt|yo_yo: maybe 5@C even  , not 3@D|pg||
nt|othered1: I don't like balanced 11's either, AK-A excepted, perhaps|pg||
nt|haans: had no bid vul|pg||
nt|petergill: North might dbl 2@C, but it would just push EW to 3@C which makes|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sharkey: West gets whathe asked for|pg||
nt|davidb: hi good evening|pg||
nt|h_karluk: just curiosity, when someone would intervene?|pg||
nt|szalay: 4@D was optional RKC|pg||
nt|vbman: jump raises must be so pushy in italy , l found 4sp so conservaitve|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|szalay: std polish lead: low from doubleton|pg||
nt|ady: looks like down 1|pg||
nt|yuval10: but it will turn on the right side for NS|pg||
nt|h_karluk: bid 6 make 7 now, bid 7 go down 1 when @h K fails in a different layout|pg||
nt|daman: I have been told it is 9-13|pg||
nt|mcphee: S erred here big time IMHO|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that's better|pg||
pc|d7|nt|yuval10: 4NT probably interpreted as 1430 by S|pg||
nt|sybarra: awkwardly,  but "we" landed |pg||
nt|szalay: bad hand, 2KC and queen|pg||
nt|szalay: but he has 0:)|pg||
nt|copeyj: they are heading for slam now - they have 4/5 keys and Q trumps|pg||
nt|h_karluk: my reasoning : partner gave a free bid over art 2N and decided to 3N so i shld show my respect to his decision|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i am sure you are right but West will always bid 3NT with a nebulous stop|pg||
nt|h_karluk: well, how about 3@c please? was it a must ? :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes  a must|pg||
nt|ralfwil: to succed he must take the deep finess in @s|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 3@h, 4@s, @d A  = 8 and still a chance to shift @d|pg||
nt|h_karluk: oh after @s lead no matter|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|haans: 4m for me only as invite to 5|pg||
nt|haans: as good as 1nt ruffing @D|pg||
nt|ady: yes  nice contract    I dont agree with 3NT immediate |pg||
nt|po-s: Even 3-2 in trumps is nad enough if same hand has two diamonds|pg||
nt|h_karluk: almost slam but fails, a @s and @c A obvious losers, good stop, S not excited|pg||
nt|haans: score to NS |pg||
nt|sybarra: this is ambitious|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ady: should east have removed to 2@S  with 3 in each?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think many would double to show equal strength|pg||
nt|haans: you win some lose some|pg||
nt|sybarra: likely to play for the drop in @H's |pg||
nt|hawe45:  4 boards 50 minutes|pg||
nt|xenya: exciting|pg||
nt|haans: dinessing inh spades|pg||
nt|yuval10: very good X by E, sensing the misfit|pg||
nt|haans: raise @D|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|xenya: but can they beat 3N?|pg||
nt|haans: if decl play spade = go up with Q|pg||
nt|yo_yo: oh yes, not easy|pg||
nt|ralfwil: or rely on a mistake in the defence|pg||
nt|h_karluk: then all roads to rome, he has something and probably picked his best, really when they can stop at 3 N, never? :)|pg||
nt|othered1: 5@D doesn't give partner much room|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|szalay: some players play GF means: "forcing to 4-of-minor if 3N not possible"|pg||
nt|szalay: I predicted small slam|pg||
nt|szalay: good play is often slow play, imho|pg||
nt|haans: may still be a flat |pg||
nt|copeyj: what would you lead as west?|pg||
nt|copeyj: QX@D looks like a terrible holding|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: Thomas is hoping he has some extra's tho|pg||
nt|po-s: difficult lead|pg||
nt|haans: some say with 4 trump lead one|pg||
nt|copeyj: Volcker is, by the way, in the final of the French Open Trials - he defeated Bessis in the semi final!|pg||
nt|po-s: HJ perhaps??|pg||
nt|copeyj: and apparently Bessis is sat at the table writing out their convention card our operator tells me!|pg||
nt|copeyj: A trump has been suggested by some kibbers - but QX@D puts me off that - I would lead a @H and then it is a question of which @H to lead|pg||
nt|haans: squeeze tempo|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, east is done|pg||
nt|h_karluk: maybe just would employ a heart finesse then enjoy|pg||
pc|d3|nt|haans: Hung may hope for 2nt from W|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hi David welcome aboard|pg||
nt|rnmalik: could S on 5@D bid 5@S?|pg||
nt|szalay: play will be fast|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Can't make it with spades 4-1 and diamonds 4-2|pg||
nt|haans: now decl to think what took so long|pg||
nt|po-s: could you with spades 3-2?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Depends who has 2|pg||
nt|sybarra: can we negotiate 10 tricks here?|pg||
nt|haans: some way im sure :)|pg||
pc|d5|nt|h_karluk: i think i would definitely couldn't find that grand - when @h K wasn't at partner|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: fryklund was not sure about 4 nt answer so he bid 7 h lucky boy........|pg||
nt|h_karluk: wild but worked, congrats|pg||
nt|szalay: it wd be exclusion|pg||
nt|h_karluk: okay say N rebid 2@c (3+) really what could be S's rebid after 1N F1? :)|pg||
nt|mcphee: even if partner holds 3@D it is 100% clear to raise @D I think|pg||
nt|yo_yo: they lay out is a bit fortunate for NS |pg||
nt|yo_yo: what about a show up squeeze?|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|h_karluk: shalom :)|pg||
nt|haans: 16 no good lead|pg||
nt|yuval10: E would've done better by ducking the @d|pg||
nt|henryb:  now that would not occur to me. I think X asks partner to lead MY suit|pg||
nt|haans: only one entry in spades|pg||
nt|haans: clubs are not a good entry|pg||
nt|h_karluk: now enjoy long clubs at the table|pg||
nt|xenya: 5@C makes on any lead of course -- as does 4@S -- somewhat luckily though |pg||
nt|yuval10: i think 4@h is making too if you insist :)|pg||
nt|xenya: yes|pg||
pc|s7|nt|yo_yo: 2 club losers and a H but they cant get to them|pg||
nt|po-s: The pass isn´t such a terrible decision (only pretty bad) considering his void in spades|pg||
nt|mcphee: assume N holds only 3@D, his likely shape is 5-3-3-2 making the S hand a great fit, do you not think so?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think with 0-4-5-4 and 2K+1Q after F1N not easy rebids there esp 2@c rebid (3+) comes by declarer|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ady: try a club|pg||
nt|haans: I would have played 2@H|pg||
nt|po-s: of course, but to consider the quality of the slam|pg||
nt|marlowepi: perhaps W thought that the double by E created a force (since E did not just bid some number of hearts at first turn). otherwise 4H seems questionable, with the poor minors. a ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: double pushing us to the 3-level should be 6 LTC so W doesnt have anything extra|pg||
nt|ritong: this has the merit to get it fast|pg||
nt|h_karluk: protected himself, nicely done|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sharkey: North is Lars Kirkegaard Nielsen - Jacco informs he insisted on being shown as K. Nielsen|pg||
nt|sharkey: looks like 500|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|hawe45:  claim|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sybarra: spade switch now?|pg||
nt|sybarra: but all roads lead to -1 (or 2_ |pg||
nt|yuval10: not declarer has no problems at all|pg||
nt|yo_yo: crunch time|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hard, N has safe discards|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but in 3N, good question, worths to analyse trick by trick|pg||
nt|ralfwil: there is no squeeze tempo|pg||
nt|yo_yo: finesse @H then run the trumps|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but still depends on North having @S|pg||
nt|yo_yo: actually he can count North for  2 of the 3 queens|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it's just @S10 he's worried about|pg||
pc|c7|nt|Walddk4: It's a bad one, agreed|pg||
nt|haans: 4@D just natural|pg||
pc|cK|nt|h_karluk: I think Denmark would win this set very easily|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Small @H is the only chance|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|haans: :) easy make :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: clubs blocked |pg||
nt|othered1: @C leads are messing with entries to set up long @D|pg||
pc|hK|nt|szalay: small @S now|pg||
nt|ady: should cash out for -1|pg||
nt|haans: no more spade = spades 4-1|pg||
pc|h2|nt|h_karluk: and maybe they convert IMPs to 20 VP scale, eh ?|pg||
pc|h7|nt|daman: no more for NS|pg||
nt|marlowepi: especially since bad breaks can be expected. |pg||
nt|yo_yo: well is 5@D such a good contract?  the specs dont think so|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that's why i guess S passed confidently|pg||
nt|othered1: But they bid ti like they had it and avoided the axe.|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|haans: and 3 Q|pg||
nt|marlowepi: right|pg||
nt|haans: but 3@H may be forcing|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: West went for a toilet break|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but in my view W was right to think that the E auction created a force. I think it was E who overrated the value of his hand, with so much spade wastage, no shortness, and spades ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: due to be overruffed by N|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: they had a misunderstanding about 3@H forcing or not|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: East thought not, West thought it was|pg||
nt|haans: then we all agree|pg||
nt|mcphee: that is not the S hands decision to make though Kath|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@C Pass 1NT would be 11-12 no 4 card major balanced - this is one of the advantages of the transfer responses - you don't have to get to 2NT with 11 opposite 11 |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|po-s: Tim, which bid was worst?|pg||
pc|h8|nt|pelu: 2@H sh 4-4 or 4-5 - with 5-4 West could bid 2@S - still weak|pg||
nt|haans: axe seldom present today|pg||
pc|s2|pc|hT|pg||
nt|daman: doink   claim |pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: S: " sorry"|pg||
nt|haans: 8 finesse 9 dont|pg||
nt|mcphee: bidding 3@D does not mean you are getting to game|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Bob, do you play uncontested 1@s>1N (F1) 3@d invite or better?|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: strange play here, N was upset |pg||
pc|c8|nt|szalay: do we know contract in next room?|pg||
pc|c5|nt|haans: oe 2@S 5 carder invite|pg||
nt|yo_yo: if it had gone off we would be applauding Nabil |pg||
pc|cT|pc|c9|pg||
nt|haans: nilsen did show odd clubs|pg||
nt|sharkey: West's 4@D bid is immature and undiciplined, but not unexpected from the young players.  We've all been there and it's part of "growing up".|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: players taking a short break|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 7@S|pg||
nt|szalay: hope not green cigarette|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Nicely bid in OR|pg||
nt|szalay: wd Holland, confess|pg||
nt|szalay: 11 imps for them|pg||

nt|yo_yo: easy for us :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: the only must at bridge tables is "more counting" - i think i love the math science much :)|pg||
nt|vbman: if pard had king 4th sp then slam wd have a chance|pg||
nt|h_karluk: half of the match over|pg||
nt|sybarra: so wd,  on the "any 11" |pg||
nt|haans: nothing has happened yet|pg||
nt|sybarra: wonder if they are fighting again |pg||
nt|haans: yed ED soon long talk about that|pg||
nt|othered1: both of them took pushy actions|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: nope... NS were discussing if this auction was Forcing over 5@D|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 20-20 there|pg||
nt|petergill: Well played|pg||
mb|1C|nt|hawe45:  Best game here 3 NT, but difficult to reach|pg||
nt|pelu: 11 tricks in 4@H - coffee time :)|pg||
nt|haans: 3nt (no clubs lead)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, not all. E thought NF|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 28-12 now|pg||
nt|othered1: that wasn't "any" as it did have 2 + honor tricks|pg||
nt|haans: long overdue|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: time to bid 3@H|pg||
nt|szalay: probably 4@S silences everyone|pg||
nt|h_karluk: in other words game time|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: what about the lucky 6@c? ;)|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|szalay: leave table..and slower play...|pg||
nt|xenya: much better to play @Ds up twice from W|pg||
nt|h_karluk: cold 4@s|pg||
nt|haans: bid better than x|pg||
nt|haans: easy slam here|pg||
nt|pelu: play to one goal - but Australia No 4 and NL-21 No 22 in the standing, so natural|pg||
nt|h_karluk: my guess EW would buy to 2/3 @s|pg||
nt|szalay: may be 3@S yet|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like 4@s for me with N's cards|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|mcphee: so if it is invite ahnd how can it be included in the F group?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: close hands|pg||
nt|h_karluk: in other words borderline|pg||
nt|haans: east bidding 1@H?|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, he p rotected himself from the twelfth trick|pg||
nt|haans: his best choice|pg||
nt|h_karluk: defenders would only cash their 4 @s tricks, yes very lucky @c slam while @d hook onside|pg||
nt|yuval10: awkward bid for N now|pg||
nt|xenya: on 2, the French tool one step further to 3@C -- 1 down and 4 imps to Israel|pg||
nt|xenya: *took|pg||
nt|h_karluk: while 4 @h not much hard maybe 4@s x-2 nice try|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@D 4+ hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: impossible to play with that speed|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hmm, 4 cards M|pg||
nt|szalay: but a lot better if they dont lead @D|pg||
nt|haans: 18-19 balanced hand (italian style)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: most use the 4NT opener as asking for aces|pg||
nt|yo_yo: obviously here it's for minors|pg||
nt|h_karluk: unusual - like overcall|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Grosset has to bid @S surely|pg||
nt|ralfwil: my only bid as E is pass|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i hate those three Js though|pg||
nt|yo_yo: presumably West has shown   a monster hand with the majors|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i won't double as East, i ve a junk|pg||
nt|ralfwil: if W can bid again (nothing else than D) i can bid my @s|pg||
nt|othered1: why should it be forcing when they passed out at 3@S?|pg||
mb|1H!|nt|h_karluk: 3@s super accept i expect by E|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Cold with 4 losers...|pg||
nt|haans: stronger than 3@C|pg||
nt|ady: grand      not wasy to locate |pg||
nt|pelu: close to a 2@C-opening - 2½ loser|pg||
nt|ady: yes   should be routine|pg||
nt|sybarra: ugh,  I would probably also open 2nt but looking at all 4 hands this will not be a success|pg||
nt|daman: if South had led the @H K    he could have switched to a @D after seeing dummy     the @H K is a standard lead in that situation      no guarantee to beat 4@S though since @Ds are ...|pg||
nt|daman: ...|pg||
nt|mcphee: 2@S 2N?|pg||
nt|mcphee: or 2@S 3@S?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: one of those :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: here ? i agree with 1N for sure|pg||
nt|ritong: no big deal, though|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i am ok to handle such hands with uncontested 1N (15-17) then 3@h (mild slam invite for @c suit)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: say opener refuse then stops at 3N, otherwise pulls|pg||
nt|vbman: so this opens a way|pg||
nt|sybarra: some sort of preemptive raise coming (and did) |pg||
nt|haans: suggestion after 3@S giving oppd 4 level but  axe at 5|pg||
nt|othered1: another not very light overcall.|pg||
nt|yuval10: 3@s is a good bid by E to jam the bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: preemts|pg||
nt|yo_yo: what's the advantage of transfer responses?|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
mb|1N|nt|sybarra: S can "see" no hts in N |pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: 6@C looks cold to me here|pg||
nt|haans: slam here|pg||
nt|mcphee: some feel pass and 2N is a choice|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and 2@s rebid also, 3@s adventure <my review, my opinion>|pg||
nt|mcphee: S could try 2@C and hope to survie that|pg||
nt|po-s: the only way to convince anyonae that 2D-pass isn´t terrible would be to move the HA to West|pg||
nt|yo_yo: what a view!   |pg||
nt|h_karluk: my worst fears confirmed, E doubled, fortunately W passed|pg||
nt|yuval10: otherwise very easy for S to bid 3@h and for N to raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: but do you X|pg||
nt|sybarra: not so sure bidding 5 @D in tempo might not get them to 5 @H  but we will never know |pg||
nt|rnmalik: 2@S and @CJ and cross ruff possible|pg||
nt|h_karluk: now makes 3NT|pg||
nt|szalay: I dont use "congrats" in this case:) lucky is more normal:)|pg||
nt|sharkey: 3 NT on a @D lead|pg||
nt|haans: good q to all what did double mean? lead dummy or own suit|pg||
nt|sybarra: may flop into 3 nt but see judith using slow approach |pg||
nt|copeyj: Nab choosin just to invite with 4333 9 count|pg||
nt|po-s: I think 4C is a slight overbid. South has good trumps and a working HK plus ruffing value in diamonds, must definitely bid 4H, but then....|pg||
nt|copeyj: but Drijver tries 3N anyway on strength of his @C suit despite the minimum hcp|pg||
nt|haans: nothing wrong with 6n|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: true, :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo:  tres bien Grosset|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: West held off after last hand... - not unexpected|pg||
nt|h_karluk: weird, W declined the invitation|pg||
nt|sharkey: 4@S set with @D shift|pg||
nt|haans: missin game not junior style :) sort of|pg||
nt|haans: you needed some thing like Blue clubs to find slam|pg||
nt|yuval10: once again NS will make their contract, probably with an overtrick|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: this should be 1 away without too much trouble|pg||
nt|haans: 15 with a lose Q|pg||
nt|Walddk4: They both had borderline hands. I don't think 4@C is a serious overbid with all those controls|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 7 controls, AKxxx suit|pg||
nt|copeyj: Volcker must switch to @H when he is in with the @CK |pg||
nt|h_karluk: but his homework was 3N, right?|pg||
nt|tomi2: parter might play him for havin 5 cards and raise 3 3@H in their methods with 4 card support|pg||
nt|ritong: any trick counts with a VP scale|pg||
nt|othered1: wouidln't it be nice if west could have shown @H shortness on this particular hand?|pg||
nt|petergill: 11H 11-15 with 3 hearts or 11-13 (bad) with 4 hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: What wd u lead from T962?|pg||
nt|sybarra: 10 |pg||
nt|szalay: I think either 6 or 2 (depends on your methods)|pg||
nt|szalay: T is not a honour:)|pg||
nt|szalay: u can waste interior cards that way...watch it now...|pg||
nt|xenya: on 1, the Poles in the other room wound up in 4@H -- strange contract. 11 imps to Israel|pg||
nt|szalay: with appropriate entries declaler could have 4 tricks now|pg||
nt|szalay: it looks another good board for Dutch 2suiter methods|pg||
nt|ritong: some more than others , admittedly|pg||
nt|h_karluk: West for sure confident that his partner has cover cards, however in which suits, for now unsure|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@H|pg||
nt|haans: depend on what 1nt rebid show 18-19 or not 3 @H|pg||
nt|petergill: 1NT denies 4 spades as 1@S over 1@H would be 4 spades, non forcing|pg||
pc|d2|nt|szalay: cant take 10 tricks, imho|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @s Qj drops, wow|pg||
nt|haans: naturally or bid it :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: meanwhile that's a mirror hand|pg||
nt|daman: 3-3   and West can pitch a @C|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our next match, in about 45 minutes, will be France 2 vs Netherlands Red (leaders)|pg||
nt|vbman: when cards are open who wants to play this in 6cl?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: easy contract, declarer may claim very soon|pg||
nt|vbman: in 5cl its different|pg||
nt|h_karluk: unless i see @d AQjx at my hand i cannot dream|pg||
nt|vbman: must be careful to avoid to dia loser|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 6 losers hand with East, surely worths to go 3 level alone|pg||
nt|ralfwil: with only one entry on W the @h finess (for @hJ) is necessary|pg||
nt|petergill: The extra bidding space for the transfers allows you to stop in 1@H or 1@S sometimes|pg||
nt|petergill: from the transfers I mean|pg||
pc|d6|nt|sybarra: a scramble but can find 9 tricks |pg||
nt|copeyj: I dont think so Shirley|pg||
nt|mcphee: 3@S a tad pushy with this suit I think|pg||
nt|po-s: no Barry, one is enough, don´t overdo things|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i only see 3 Aces and a tenace, no quick tricks, just 6223|pg||
nt|othered1: gives you an extra bid and determines level of support quickly, they say.  |pg||
nt|othered1: And may let  you right side NT contracts into opener's,presumably stronger, hand.|pg||
nt|haans: at no cost |pg||
nt|yuval10: 4@s can go down 3 in a perfect D|pg||
nt|yuval10: but not after lead @d|pg||
pc|dK|nt|h_karluk: i was polite - meant 'congrats - with murder in my heart' :)|pg||
nt|chick: I think the usual meaning of the double is lead my suit, but if both have bid a suit, it's lead the non-normal one|pg||
nt|haans: very hard to avoid|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it's a bit pushy but 2@S  doesnt seem enough|pg||
nt|po-s: Is South trying to compenate for his earlier pass?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think there's not extras|pg||
nt|po-s: compensate|pg||
nt|mcphee: y Kath it doesn't, but for me a major overbid|pg||
nt|yo_yo: there's something to that, especially when we hear North was upset|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and 1NT is closed box, maybe good or bad, who knows, say good still pulls, say bad, nice stop|pg||
nt|mcphee: well if 1N is bad, 3@S is likely going to fail|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that's why i advocated 2@s nice stop|pg||
nt|po-s: H7 lead may prove costly|pg||
nt|yo_yo: specs are advocating a 2@C rebid by south  but i find that strange with a 6 card major|pg||
nt|mcphee: well if you survive 2@C it is not so bad|pg||
nt|h_karluk: count me in, no extras, no adventure|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes look at the @H spots|pg||
nt|po-s: why would 3S go down?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: in worst scenario during auction PO|pg||
nt|mcphee: facing a bad hand it might not even make 2 PO|pg||
nt|h_karluk: yes, that's another possibility BOB, so minimum damage not bad, eh :)|pg||
nt|othered1: That I'm not too sure of.  There's always a cost.|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @D better than @C ib South|pg||
nt|hawe45:  in|pg||
nt|haans: must play one more @H psychic|pg||
nt|szalay: -200 is a bargain here|pg||
pc|h6|nt|szalay: but South thought more undertricks, I believe|pg||
nt|ady: acw  king ace and those trumps  seems double right|pg||
nt|szalay: but he must switch to trump|pg||
nt|szalay: North count helped a lot|pg||
nt|ady: yes agree|pg||
nt|sybarra: pickling his own suit however |pg||
nt|h_karluk: to @c lead|pg||
pc|h2|nt|hawe45:  No Lavinthal this @C 8...!|pg||
nt|chick: not me, I would open 1@D and rebid 2N ... I think HCP is an excellent indication of NT values, and I stretch of the standard HCP only with a strong source of extra tricks|pg||
nt|haans: you did last time we played 3ntxx|pg||
nt|haans: 3@C puppet i presume|pg||
nt|copeyj: now Bessis must switch to @H|pg||
nt|haans: hearts now down|pg||
nt|po-s: I said "slight" overbid, and if they have no other strong support bid then ....|pg||
nt|h_karluk: double for doen one, phew|pg||
nt|haans: change that to 'low cost'|pg||
nt|sybarra: this will "flop" nicely (as Henri would say) |pg||
pc|hK|nt|yuval10: 3NT would've been easier here|pg||
nt|szalay: when longer trump could be tapped, moysian (4-3) fit isnt so good|pg||
nt|yuval10: but it looks like declarer can still manage|pg||
nt|sharkey: sry - E doesn't have any useful pitch on @H10|pg||
nt|hawe45:  6 I mean|pg||

nt|szalay: why not 3N over 2?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: for our kibitzers let me try to explain : same shape at EW|pg||
nt|rnmalik: on @C switch|pg||
nt|szalay: I have heard same contract in OR|pg||
nt|szalay: I have a spy:)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Your interest well appreciated your match:)|pg||
nt|szalay: bidding was: 2@H-X-4@H-4@S|pg||
nt|szalay: dunno why not doubled by North|pg||
nt|szalay: I am Hungarian, my Godmother was Dutch...what I need more?:)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: yes on that bidding X possible|pg||
nt|haans: my suit 2 down|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: yes|pg||
nt|daman: this was a neat auction|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: montanari very relieved franchi has @h's|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: but he's the kind of guy to joke around|pg||
nt|haans: had bid 3@C myself (showing 4 spades)|pg||
nt|othered1: Right.  Among them, opponents can use the actual suit bid for whatever they'd like, including natural or to distinguish defensively-proemted hands.|pg||
nt|yo_yo: the spade pips make this an easy hand|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sybarra: tap dummy is ok |pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think  3@c was NF there|pg||
nt|rnmalik: mixed feelings:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: hmm, decl threw @cq trick one|pg||
nt|haans: ok|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: couldn't see, he's a big man|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|h_karluk: i think coaches never allow psyches in junior level|pg||
nt|haans: well done|pg||
nt|xenya: E's double is beyond my understanding|pg||
nt|daman: Turley picked up 5 IMPs on Board 2|pg||
nt|haans: high to me is ruff high|pg||
nt|copeyj: ouch|pg||
nt|mcphee: wow|pg||
nt|mcphee: will he get this right?|pg||
nt|po-s: I think with defenced like these there is little risk in jumping away|pg||
nt|ralfwil: who says that W has 2 defensive tricks? none on E|pg||
nt|yo_yo: or tres bien Verbeek |pg||
nt|h_karluk: for records *down - srry for typo guys|pg||
pc|s4|nt|szalay: from T9xy I wd lead T/9 only if X=8|pg||
nt|xenya: this doesn't look rosy for declarer|pg||
nt|szalay: otherwise x or y|pg||
nt|daman: Turkey*|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: that's a reasonable play... I was actually typing out something to that respect|pg||
nt|haans: use  spectable|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: but realized declarer was missing the JT@H|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: which makes it a lot less attractive|pg||
nt|yo_yo: both sides did well|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|rnmalik: -1|pg||
nt|haans: (2@D-3@C)|pg||
nt|daman: they bid up to 4@C and then sold out to 4@H and beat it|pg||
nt|chick: or Turkiye :)|pg||
nt|daman: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: misguessed the hearts|pg||
nt|tomi2: now thei found out about their 11 card club fit :)|pg||
nt|vbman: now two dia|pg||
nt|haans: telling opps how to defend game?|pg||
nt|yuval10: yes, 3 rounds of @c, South discard his lone @d|pg||
pc|d5|nt|szalay: not, xruff is coming|pg||
nt|ady: I think will make 8 trump tricks and 2 spades   needed to play a trump|pg||
nt|szalay: what was South's plan?|pg||
nt|haans: or Sweden or ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: would employ a hook, 3-3 friendly distribution|pg||
nt|h_karluk: pitches stiff @d and gets a ruff etc|pg||
pc|d3|nt|othered1: defensively-oriented|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx to pards a87x, and k9 in south, etc |pg||
nt|yuval10: then ruff !f, AK@h|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|yuval10: he was affraid of stoppers in the red suit |pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: I could repeat the comment i made last board|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|szalay: ouch...|pg||
nt|sybarra: oops|pg||
nt|szalay: he was optimistic last time, became pessimistic now?:)|pg||
nt|davidb: agressive  juniors bidding . W  has an easy pass over 3H |pg||
nt|daman: this was not a painful switch|pg||
nt|haans: or Romex|pg||
nt|daman: gave up the suit|pg||
nt|petergill: Maybe he can pitch @CQ on the 4th @D to create an extra entry in @CJ? Maybe not?|pg||
nt|petergill: "not" is more like it|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d9|nt|szalay: it wont make, I think...especially when declarer ate his @D entry|pg||
nt|haans: do they listen to coaches|pg||
nt|haans: spade finesse|pg||
pc|dT|nt|yuval10: suits even|pg||
nt|szalay: its not 7HCP's duty|pg||
nt|yuval10: *@d|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|h_karluk: or drop|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, the @S 10 could be promoted|pg||
pc|d7|pc|s3|nt|ady: what was west's plan|pg||
nt|haans: 2 defensive trick :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: might mean it as sort of a responsive....|pg||
nt|daman: a pedestrian @C continuation seems best|pg||
pc|h5|nt|sharkey: so off 1|pg||
nt|yo_yo: squeeze time|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|sybarra: Koike, did not realize his blessing |pg||
nt|haans: why did North not play the @SJ|pg||
nt|h_karluk: contract impossible to make|pg||
nt|h_karluk: thanks not cashed @c A|pg||
nt|haans: not more then little unluck|pg||
nt|yuval10: no promotion actually...just 6 tricks - 3@c, @d ruff and AK@H|pg||
pc|sA|nt|h_karluk: set stone orders :)|pg||
nt|haans: and so a make|pg||
pc|s6|nt|szalay: neither of them realized that someone leads a trump, declarer's 2 trump at most 1 trick|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @d switch wld better|pg||
nt|vbman: loose to doubleton q and u r down|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ady: now losing spade trick|pg||
nt|h_karluk: however, we see it on DD, hard to visualize at th table , most players wld pick stiff lead|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|szalay: easy 2 off, next one, pls|pg||
nt|frankaus: my view is that texas is an anacronistic agreement - now superceeded|pg||
nt|h_karluk: weird but seems so, just changed his mind quickly, that's what i see|pg||
pc|sT|nt|xenya: well defended for 2 down|pg||
nt|ady: no sorry   club winner   has to ruff|pg||
nt|szalay: no|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I agree with Simon that 4@H was an overbid. Wasted @CK, xx in diamonds and only four trumps|pg||
nt|h_karluk: to 5?|pg||
nt|vbman: yes|pg||
nt|xenya: true Yuval|pg||
nt|h_karluk: on the other hand 3@c there|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so there might be a reason to lead from J9|pg||
nt|yuval10: good score by EW anyway, it seem|pg||
nt|pierced: i dunno|pg||
pc|s7|nt|szalay: partner has  half of teh deck|pg||
nt|rnmalik: back to -2 and flat|pg||
pc|sK|nt|szalay: instead of @C @D is a good lead here|pg||
nt|daman: it will cost them an IMP eventually would be my guess|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|mcphee: used to be Kath:)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ady: down 1|pg||
nt|rnmalik: that play of @H was fatal to the contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: Koike looks like he knows what chance he missed|pg||
nt|szalay: and Molenaar?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: how abt say OR lands 4@h|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c7|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|h_karluk: push next please|pg||
nt|mcphee: oh it is still there|pg||
nt|xenya: might not be so good now|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 620 vs 500 then|pg||
nt|haans: so as to to be endplayed|pg||
mc|5|nt|pierced: think its -2 |pg||

nt|rnmalik: or bad assessment:)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: rebid showed 18-19, so if there is a nearest game why not 3N by S|pg||
nt|szalay: touch and go 4@H|pg||
nt|szalay: it will makes if trump by opps: no option just staright @C hook|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 20-20 1st time there|pg||
nt|pelu: strong 2@C and positiv response - if East can show 4 controls - easy way to 6|pg||
nt|haans: not me but 1NT = 4 controls|pg||
nt|ady: 4 hearts fails with K@D wrong|pg||
nt|chick: There IS a guideline that says when the auction goes 2N P P, 4th seat should double on principle, because the dummy has no entries for finessing and declarer will have to play out ...|pg||
nt|chick: of his own hand |pg||
nt|chick: sometimes it works :)|pg||
nt|szalay: funny when it was passed out North could think: "ouch, may I double yet?"|pg||
nt|sybarra: true chick |pg||
nt|szalay: if pd has Q of @D: 3 off|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: de Pagter tried to trick Lazar on the last brd with discarding @d|pg||
nt|daman: partscore again|pg||
nt|daman: where are the slam hands?|pg||
nt|copeyj: pretty likely game swing to the Netherlands, that one|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 4@C usually contains a strong diamond suit, so I would be much happier with @DQ than @HK|pg||
nt|haans: defense losers more points than decl makes|pg||
nt|haans: was it a weak nt?|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: yes|pg||

nt|othered1: or telling partner should they buy it |pg||
nt|haans: yep both count :(|pg||
nt|yuval10: it is|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so just 3 IMPs, anyways in 10 boards match not bad|pg||

mb|p|nt|h_karluk: 24-16 again partscore|pg||
nt|po-s: ATxx.AJx,AKQxx,x  is opener´s hand. If he gets 4S, should he bid again??|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: 5431 is a good treatment|pg||
nt|szalay: Poles invented 5431-convention|pg||
nt|hawe45:  East will welcome a @S-opening + do.-support|pg||
nt|haans: not 2 aces K = 1 contraol Ace 2|pg||
nt|haans: all may be in @D'|pg||
nt|sybarra: but at imps,  maybe not always prudent |pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: I always find the making lead when my partner doubles on principle :(|pg||
nt|xenya: yes perhaps it means: pd, we have more points than they -- but so what?|pg||
nt|daman: what would we bid with the South hand?  1NT?|pg||
nt|chick: giving juniors too many slam hands can result in bids at the 8 level :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that's a good one Hamdi|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 22-18 and from this empty hat ? :)|pg||

nt|szalay: easy 4@H/3N by E-W|pg||

nt|yuval10: the favourable lie of the cards here mean that NS can make 12 tricks in both minors|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 3@s should end the auction, and poor W is almost endplayed already|pg||
nt|copeyj: Drijver will be pleased to see N bid 3@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: South alerted, almost bid 4@h, and then realised something|pg||
nt|mcphee: might beat this|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i wonder how EW in OR didn't pick 2@s with their 4/4 fit|pg||

nt|haans: small @D is good play again 4-2|pg||
nt|copeyj: some pairs play 2NT as artificial raises - works well but will generally mean you lose something elsewhere - like you have to open all 18-19 balanced hands 1@C not 1@D for example|pg||
nt|mcphee: I think Kath was referring to a @D lead from S|pg||
nt|yo_yo: did that awful preempt push them too high?|pg||

nt|h_karluk: seems N is a solo performer|pg||
nt|yo_yo: do we like that 3@S?|pg||
nt|yuval10: if E finds the X here....|pg||
nt|yuval10: he knows NS are short in points and he has a singel in P's suit. can't be any better for defense|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|vugraphzeg: connection was rather slow|pg||
nt|szalay: personally my preference list by Sout over 1@H is:|pg||
nt|szalay: pass, 1N....period....2@C|pg||
nt|haans: suprised they do not play trf here|pg||
nt|sharkey: if it's a "coulda" - probably too close to x at IMPs|pg||
nt|ady: west overcall on 4 card suit understandable|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our next match (and last today) in about 40 minutes: Norway vs Italy|pg||
nt|haans: South endbid :)|pg||
nt|szalay: with likely plus for n-s, anyway|pg||
nt|pelu: easy 1@s - u dont X on 5 card major exp u are very strong|pg||
nt|rnmalik: X must with this hand|pg||
nt|szalay: in this case often happens save over 7@C:)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Why not 5 NT by South - pick a minor - and 6 @C =  MY suit|pg||
nt|chick: conservative?  juniors?  they are fearless!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I like "pretty awful"|pg||
nt|haans: 3@H means suits not 3-2 (that often)|pg||
nt|haans: so keept it cool|pg||
nt|haans: low spade to t and a slow make in slam|pg||
nt|marlowepi: low spade to ten is the winner, but from a technical/statistical standpoint it is the worst of the three ways to try and pick up the whole spade suit|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it wins only against stiff nine, and there are two alternatives each of which is twice as good|pg||
nt|haans: agree to that|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: North told East that she doesn't know what to bid|pg||
nt|marlowepi: playing an honor from dummy first succeeds in two cases (stiff J/Q), and triple-finessing W also wins in two cases|pg||
nt|marlowepi: how does that differ from simply huddling? does a trance mean "i know what to bid, but i want you to think i don't" ? :):)|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: I don't know.. she just told it, i think it means more, I have no clue, rather than I have to make a choice between 2 bids|pg||
nt|haans: for beginner yes that who the bid|pg||
nt|ralfwil: no|pg||
nt|ritong: dwyer should show interest for @cs|pg||
nt|haans: in sweden that mean 6@C+ singel @H|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @d breaks evenly, 35.6 pct, stiff @h, @c Q..everything is on the right spot|pg||
nt|haans: now u have a choice|pg||
nt|haans: strongish|pg||
nt|yuval10: wd|pg||
mb|p|nt|po-s: better to bid 2H - then East will be reluctant to bid NT|pg||
nt|copeyj: 3@S here showing @S stop and concern about @H|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe be playing this from side I did not expect |pg||
nt|haans: 3@S showing spade stopper hearts ???|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The grand slam hand is played in 6@D next door|pg||
nt|copeyj: very surprising|pg||
nt|haans: u mean the automatic grand?|pg||
nt|sybarra: the 14+ trick slam |pg||
nt|copeyj: wonder if Nab is worried that 3@S is asking|pg||
nt|copeyj: must be I guess|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i would not try to be his p even for a while|pg||
nt|yo_yo: :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i hope we never meet Verbeek , he wont be pleased with us|pg||
nt|ralfwil: not 4@c on E either|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i ignore players who likes to play both sides of the table|pg||
nt|ralfwil: sry 4@d|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If ny partner bids like that I have enough for 5@d|pg||
nt|ralfwil: my...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so east convinced himself to join the fiesta|pg||
nt|yo_yo: martine verbeek,  a lady!|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i've decided I like her bidding after all|pg||
nt|h_karluk: tarzan in the trouble|pg||
nt|h_karluk: sorry Miss Verbeek, how could i know, no photo available there|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: martine is not here she is not a junior any more (for several Years). This is Tim |pg||
nt|yo_yo: specs now telling me it's Erik or Tim|pg||
mb|3N|nt|szalay: do u see any reason not to pass 2@H?|pg||
nt|szalay: or a strength showing double is an option yet|pg||
nt|xenya: on 3, where Israel bid up to 5@D here, the Poles in the other room reached an even worse contract -- 3N -- 3 off and 3 imps to Israel |pg||
nt|h_karluk: in new year teams, we were tied 42-42, then 3 more extension boards, again tied, and last board just won with 1 IMP |pg||
nt|szalay: personally I wd bid 3N over 2N|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: there's you slam|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 13 IMPs to France but they may get most of them back on the very next hand|pg||
nt|Walddk4: All of them in fact|pg||
nt|sybarra: these are not beginners |pg||
nt|haans: 5nt slam force?|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: opposite a 12-14 Nt?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: uh-oh, the worst of all possible choices.......slow double|pg||
nt|haans: in polish i know 2@C show 15+|pg||
mb|p|nt|VugraphPl1: last board   thanks all |pg||
nt|daman: -1|pg||
nt|haans: i think 6@S was insulting p|pg||
nt|daman: unless they completely misdefend|pg||
nt|copeyj: can get away with this - can make 5@C or @D I think |pg||
nt|sybarra: 5 @C might stand a better chance |pg||
nt|othered1: North is embarking on a painstaking auction.  |pg||
nt|haans: funny bidding here|pg||
mb|p|nt|VugraphPl1: http://michzimny.pl/bridge/2010/pila/gp.html|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 @D by S?|pg||
nt|xenya: what do you think about N's double?|pg||
nt|frankaus: X do something sensible is a reasonable call |pg||
nt|sybarra: agressive?|pg||
nt|szalay: its normal, imho|pg||
nt|xenya: is it penalty?|pg||
nt|szalay: especially if u play sound overcalls..and send greetings to East for reopen|pg||
nt|xenya: penalty-orinted i should say|pg||
nt|szalay: 8-10, bid sthg, imho|pg||
nt|szalay: I doubt it|pg||
nt|frankaus: no here  - opps bid & raise  X = t/o|pg||
nt|szalay: btw if South passes and North bids @C a BIT easier, but isnt easy yet|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but makes with a lucky @d hook|pg||
nt|szalay: they play: minor ALWAYS P/C|pg||
nt|szalay: and NT means: I have a suit|pg||
nt|haans: assume 3nt show 5 @H puppet variation|pg||
nt|xenya: interesting 3N rebid: partner, i want to be in 3N even if you have 4 hearts? |pg||
nt|yuval10: there are no difficulties here with the play|pg||
nt|haans: 3@H = no major |pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: 3NT showing hearts, yes|pg||
nt|xenya: ah i see|pg||
nt|chick: actually, most of the interest in these hands has been the bidding|pg||
nt|haans: fiver|pg||
nt|xenya: thanks|pg||
nt|haans: singel @H is here we go|pg||
nt|h_karluk: for hard times both @s honours are onside|pg||
nt|ritong: it needs a tornado to beat slam here|pg||
nt|haans: @D 3-3|pg||
nt|xenya: at least 1 down, could be 2|pg||
nt|yuval10: W should decide if to signel @d or @c, both cases he needs the Ace with P....|pg||
nt|yuval10: tough call|pg||
nt|h_karluk: passed hand's D commendable or not, i ve some doubts abt that question|pg||
nt|haans: opps may get a lead doublöe|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but 3nt on the right hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: I think North can double 4@S quite confidently|pg||
nt|szalay: or 3N yet..J9xxx in 1 suit, AK9x in other|pg||
nt|pelu: @D now will set up a ruff for East|pg||
nt|marlowepi: could be a director call|pg||
nt|marlowepi: slam makes on spade to ten|pg||
nt|haans: yep for sure |pg||
nt|rich89: what is 1@h?|pg||
nt|yuval10: walsh perhaps|pg||
nt|yuval10: might have longer @d's|pg||
nt|h_karluk: S lucky enough his p doesn't have 5@d and 4@c|pg||
nt|rich89: oh|pg||
nt|vbman: 3cl now|pg||
pc|s4|nt|szalay: I dont like to play lowlevel dbls as penalty|pg||
nt|xenya: so it was for minors|pg||
nt|szalay: good point, Frank|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: Lotan put the Hoody of the sweater on his head after being doubled|pg||
nt|szalay: to lead stiff in pds suit is tempting|pg||
nt|pelu: the set look boring - but in almost all matches we have seen strang mistakes that cist - here good bridge|pg||
nt|hawe45:  OK|pg||
nt|copeyj: notice the @C suit here|pg||
nt|copeyj: declarer can afford one loser in @C and one in @H|pg||
nt|sybarra: none of these slams are "pretty"|pg||
nt|haans: 3@S very close|pg||
nt|sybarra: or makeable?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but in practice will fail|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: but 3@H is 500? |pg||
nt|marlowepi: double??|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: no @H lead pls partner|pg||
nt|haans: psych?|pg||
nt|ritong: double= pls lead something else|pg||
nt|haans: or negative double = do not lead my suit|pg||
nt|haans: they made it an easy slam|pg||
nt|haans: i think |pg||
nt|h_karluk: i took my breath, don't tell me 5@c passed pls :)|pg||
nt|ritong: bizarre|pg||
nt|ritong: maybe 4@d was something else than a cue|pg||
nt|haans: 5@C deny spade control????|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: they play 2@C opener as majors|pg||
pc|s2|nt|haans: what did x mean?|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: Takeout?|pg||
nt|haans: their are at least 3 variation of puppet so i refuse to play any online|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i am hairless and fearless, they are supposed to have fresh and strong hairs :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: N feels quite insistant with that hand |pg||
nt|haans: ok|pg||
nt|othered1: north "knows" EW have at least 8@H between them|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes South denied a major|pg||
pc|s8|nt|hawe45:  E/W got the chance...|pg||
nt|sharkey: this match could be a blowout|pg||
nt|haans: can East ever have 4 spades|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Yes - we all know, what England RED means - after this battle|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: typical agressive junior double|pg||
nt|frankaus: t/o do something sensible|pg||
nt|haans: many bid 1@S to show five x to show 4 |pg||
nt|h_karluk: 2@h+4@c+1@s + 5@d are his tricks|pg||
nt|szalay: with 28-29 hcp 3N generally is safer in 2 balanced hands, cause no bad trump break|pg||
nt|chick: 3@C may be checkback|pg||
nt|haans: 4@D may be ace ask|pg||
nt|ritong: i guess so, yes|pg||
nt|tomi2: 4@D was RKC, 5@C the response|pg||
nt|tomi2: 1NT was 14-16|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i am ok to play this as uncontested 1N (15-17); 3@h (mild slam invite on @c suit. Anyone tried that Bobby Goldman method ?|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Dangerous double - no defence against 4 @C|pg||
nt|sharkey: I like Dbl instead of 2@S - EW lost the whole 1 level thus they end up in this hopeless contract|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But played by South, 3 NT is percect - NOT by North|pg||
nt|april7: lets see whether EW stays also out of 4@S|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i stand on my answer whichever direction leads|pg||
nt|po-s: did they know now ---yes|pg||
nt|mcphee: at last landing in 4@S on the final bid of the auction|pg||
nt|h_karluk: after 2 initial pass he believed picked his best over double, seems recognized as natural|pg||
nt|sybarra: can scramble this one home with the good @D spots |pg||
nt|haans: no aces so weak 12 |pg||
nt|petergill: I think 2@S was artificial GF enquiry, 3@C a reply, 3@D enquired, West showed balanced minimum|pg||
pc|h3|nt|frankaus: if u beat it 1 - what have u gained  - canu really expect to beat it 2 or more?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: he leads, and has @d A, planned after @s A knocked out wld score many tricks to set|pg||
nt|po-s: 5D is laydown|pg||
nt|copeyj: so can play for either JT onside or K onside by playing one to the 9|pg||
nt|april7: after 3NT by E, W could have passed with 3-3-3-4|pg||
nt|h_karluk: friendly neighbor lead|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i dont like that lead|pg||
nt|mcphee: I am not at all sure that is correct April|pg||
nt|mcphee: the lack of @H stop facing what may be 2 small is not all the thrilling to play 3N|pg||
nt|april7: depends what 3NT meqans after 3@H by W|pg||
nt|haans: assume that mean no king|pg||
nt|ritong: well done, excellent spot|pg||
pc|h6|nt|szalay: not to play Q was a clear error, imho|pg||
nt|szalay: ruff and trump now|pg||
nt|drorp: hashavti ze helgemo hamavrik mibenehem|pg||
nt|ady: bold action from east     found partner with a useful hand including 4 clubs|pg||
nt|haans: may we see a hearts lead?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Yes, @C9 is a significant card|pg||
nt|copeyj: you can in fact make this with an overtrick|pg||
nt|yuval10: hmmmm|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|hawe45:  To me, this is the 3rd best lead from the East-hand|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Miss/Mrs Anneke thanks for emergency help :)|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|po-s: why not another club by East?|pg||
nt|haans: yes i can read (sry)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: now i see 9 tricks|pg||
nt|ritong: since @s KQ are on, it will go fast|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.nbbportal.nl/1003/|pg||
pc|sT|nt|sybarra: hate to lead a @H with the South holding |pg||
nt|haans: and playing by east|pg||
nt|othered1: Very friendly minor suit positions give north a chance to make this easily.  Trump lead limits options|pg||
nt|yuval10: now it makes i believe|pg||
pc|s5|nt|szalay: its strange to me that no one plays 3@C as puppet to 3@D: in that case u can stop in 3@D (crucial if u respond 1M with longer @Ds)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Only @H is worse|pg||
nt|Walddk4: As expected, the Dutch pair stopped short of slam on board 5|pg||
pc|s7|nt|hawe45:  Well done - Jack = @D|pg||
nt|sharkey: If S had @CK this wud make|pg||
nt|haans: but if they have not hearts stopper hearts lead good|pg||
nt|po-s: how did Drijver know that partner had diamond support?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: A wife always has support for her husband|pg||
nt|haans: 3nt a make at or 2|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|h_karluk: oh sorry i am wrong at @d|pg||
nt|yo_yo: @D lie nicely|pg||
pc|hT|nt|h_karluk: and luckily @c K at his partner|pg||
nt|Walddk4: They may not quite be married yet, but ...|pg||
nt|copeyj: he can probably work out his partner has doubleton @S from the auction and that sort of suggests some @Ds, maybe if Nab had had lots of @C or something she would have acted over ...|pg||
nt|copeyj: 2@C i dont know|pg||
nt|haans: hurray|pg||
nt|xenya: yes|pg||
pc|h2|nt|szalay: making now|pg||
nt|pelu: 10 tricks on cross-ruff|pg||
nt|ady: could have got 200 from 1NTX|pg||
nt|po-s: and after this declarer play she might not want to|pg||
nt|ritong: so they reasonably stop in game with 31 hcp at best, balanced both hands|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Tim   thanks|pg||
nt|h_karluk: can you imagine? our skilled operator shout as " hey i am a man!' omg then i am a dead meat, i m really poor to guess foreign names|pg||
nt|yo_yo: I am afraid the Dutch arent taking kindly to our views of Verbeek :)|pg||
nt|othered1: balanced by the strong upgrade  you give the @DQ|pg||
pc|h5|nt|haans: a make|pg||
nt|marlowepi: to all specs who have written me: i know it means don;t lead a heart, but it is far from clear that E wants to send that message, especially since the call gives NS more options in ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: th bidding|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|szalay: bad news: he knows going down|pg||
nt|szalay: good one: 50/trick|pg||
pc|d6|nt|szalay: N-S deserved their fate|pg||
nt|szalay: oops|pg||
nt|haans: 2@C may be the winner|pg||
pc|d4|nt|szalay: North was in driving seat at trick 2|pg||
nt|szalay: he forget to play @D early...it wasnt so bad: after @C lead he fears of @C ruff...not now|pg||
nt|daman: the only way to make this is the Sominex Coup    take 20 minutes to play the hand...put the opps to sleep....and make a false claim which they accept|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i prefer to use red card whenever i am sure abt guaranteed off 2 at my collection|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ralfwil: For me a @d on 4@d is not so far away with all this @h behind|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|sharkey: Indeed - things are going the Danes' way|pg||
nt|hawe45:  West can play the @H 3 to the 4...|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Rare also|pg||
nt|po-s: I see ten|pg||
pc|hK|nt|szalay: he MUST solve it with xxxx trumps|pg||
nt|yuval10: and no X|pg||
pc|h9|nt|szalay: if we have small trumps, ruff and lead trumps generally the best move|pg||
nt|szalay: loser on loser, pls|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and say lead came by 3rd/5th, so deduct 10 from 2, 8 cards higher, 2 at table, 3 at hand, so playing Q safe and brings a tempo ahead, also preserves a further entry |pg||
nt|april7: N had a normal @H lead after this auction,but didn't lead it|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes lose 2@D|pg||
nt|yo_yo: I have to give him his due, he is certainly pushing his opponents around|pg||
nt|h_karluk: no offense intended, just trying to do tech analyses with some humour here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a Double. sry!|pg||
nt|yo_yo: and no Jan, no challenge match for money  ( i would lose)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: well, i think say NE were partners ...i guess they shld use westinghouse break sys ;-)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|szalay: is it true?|pg||
nt|xenya: this can't be right|pg||
nt|Walddk4: He did not treasure the @C9, a pity|pg||
nt|haans: 3nt at or|pg||
nt|po-s: down now it seems|pg||
nt|copeyj: he knows the likely @C distribution but now has to guess if south started with KJX or JTX|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Against good players it is with the odds to go down now|pg||
nt|sybarra: and there is bd 5 |pg||
nt|ritong: no 4/0 trump break, just claim now|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|sybarra: 13 back to Neth. |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|haans: who plays J whit KJx|pg||
nt|h_karluk: if trumps were 3 times in West then South may have a chance to park @d loser while @c finesse successfully guessed ( in fact two way )|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|h_karluk: now @c A and @c J then @d J pitch even available, just transfers the ruff|pg||
pc|d8|nt|april7: since @D are 3-3 W has 10 tricks|pg||
nt|rich89: 8 triks|pg||
nt|vbman: an imp is coming?|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @dA marked|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Well, he survived, but we are not going to compliment him for his line|pg||
nt|yuval10: perhaps now|pg||
nt|yuval10: has no choice but to ruff and play @c's the right way|pg||
nt|rich89: 9 now|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: nabil showing AJ|pg||
pc|h8|nt|Walddk4: A good player does, Hans, and Volcker is|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d9|nt|xenya: but 8 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: sorry misclick\|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: he sure played Jack of spades|pg||
nt|h_karluk: moment of truth|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|hawe45:  next|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and still @h K hook try|pg||
nt|petergill: I think Michael Whibley could have grabbed the NTs by bidding 3NT over 3@C, but he didn't have any holdings he wanted led up to (like KJx), hence 3@D to rightside the NTs |pg||
pc|cJ|nt|haans: 500 was cheap|pg||
nt|h_karluk: got pure cash|pg||

pc|c5|nt|h_karluk: i am hairless and fearless, but Owen has long blond hairs, however in my book 3N quite interesting decision, well i think he'll not miss the chance to play in Gaitlinburg soon like ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: me and i'll make an interview to learn his thoughts right that moment :)|pg||
nt|daman: Chinese finesse|pg||

mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5C|nt|xenya: if 4@C is natural, Blackwood now will do|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: but in that case, why not 4N over 1H? what was gained by 2D etc.?|pg||
nt|ritong: possible info|pg||
nt|ritong: when opener bids something else than 2@h|pg||
nt|cuttysark: A question of whether he has discovered that East has 4 clubs - if so he can count 13, if not...|pg||
nt|ritong: no, 4@c does not show length|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i doubt that 4C showed length|pg||
nt|vugraphzef: i don't think 4 cl is natural, more like a cuebid|pg||
mb|5S|nt|Walddk2: Maybe he would get diamond support. A double-fit could be important. West would never know if he had splintered or bid 4NT at his first turn|pg||
nt|marlowepi: fair enough, but thgen why not 4N over 2H?|pg||
nt|ritong: natural|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Splinter requires East to take control - could he find out about @HQ?|pg||
nt|ritong: like 19/20 5332|pg||
mb|p|mb|6H|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: of course, the "diamond support" plan won;t be too successful if E is allowed to raise to 3D with three pieces|pg||

nt|yuval10: W couldn't have imagined 7 @c's with P, was hoping for K fifth|pg||
nt|xenya: frankly speaking, i don't like E's double very much -- hope i'm not resulting|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: EW don't seem to be so happy anymore|pg||
nt|petergill: Four boards scored, 0 - 27, even I am starting to worry just a little bit|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: EW have a lucky make in 5@D - limiting @D losers to 1|pg||
nt|haans: 30 min to next session|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ah well  maybe he got the wrong count|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 4@s ok for ew say allowed, 2@s+1@h losers|pg||
mb|1H|nt|szalay: in my humble opinion this level of the play is not good at U20 yet|pg||
nt|frankaus: -470 is not a good number on a scoresheet|pg||
nt|szalay: I think at least 8 serious mistakes in 8 bds|pg||
nt|ady: 20-20 again   no fit    |pg||
nt|ady: whoever plays likely to go down|pg||
nt|yuval10: very quick session it was|pg||
nt|pelu: a @d-lead set up @DJ to discard for a major-loser|pg||
nt|ady: must have slipped in defence to let 3@C through|pg||
nt|h_karluk: well, i do not see any reason to begin with 3@c at 1st seat|pg||
nt|pelu: but defense could still kill @dJ by ruff|pg||
nt|ady: diamond lead may set up J@D  but that can beruffed out when west wins ace of clubs|pg||
nt|haans: but why do N wait|pg||
nt|haans: easy pass|pg||
nt|pelu: with screen we often have 2 bids a time|pg||
nt|h_karluk: when you use a preempt at 3 level at 1st seat that's only against economy of space principle|pg||
nt|pelu: so it could be East in problem|pg||
nt|haans: pass all|pg||
nt|h_karluk: well, maybe they did not read our friendly yellow Gerardo's profile : rushers are added to enemy list :)|pg||
nt|haans: we got a little nervous there|pg||
nt|haans: never wrong :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: another grand but in @h|pg||
nt|petergill: Is 7@H biddable.|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: East will surely bid @D  |pg||
nt|h_karluk: you go to hunt but sometimes find yourself as hunted|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|ady: this has esculated|pg||
nt|haans: but 4@S a make 2|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: the hand got rotated|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think i would prefer 4@s|pg||
nt|pelu: would u bid 3@D?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: why not|pg||
nt|haans: if u pass 3@C sitting west can you miss game then?|pg||
nt|szalay: 1@S probably denies 4card @S, values|pg||
nt|szalay: I hate this convention, but no time to discuss it now|pg||
nt|ralfwil: What do you prefer on E - D or 5@d?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 21-19 and from this hat...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: lekely 4@s now|pg||
nt|h_karluk: *likely|pg||
nt|othered1: strong NT in OR preempted EW out of their @S partial.  1@C opening, let them in as would I.|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: operator, undo?|pg||
nt|haans: sry :(|pg||
nt|rnmalik: very different bidding as compared to OR|pg||
nt|yuval10: W on the other room did very well by leading small @c against 3NT, let's see if it will be the same here|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i meant in case ruff to 2nd @d, but in dd underlead from @h AK and set 4@s|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1NT = spades|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|szalay: 2@D: NF (std Polish approx.)|pg||
nt|pelu: with a better @h-suit u could open 1@H but not with J high|pg||
nt|sybarra: just another "exciting" hand|pg||
nt|haans: i assume spade + minor (may be 4 @S??)|pg||
nt|haans: easiest @D to king = 9|pg||
nt|xenya: i don't understand this auction|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: 2@c was alerted I think, but I don't know what it means|pg||
nt|haans: 2@D must be conventional|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: he really bid 2H|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that's a fun bid, transfer overcall  passed |pg||
nt|h_karluk: in my book, 2@h tragedy|pg||
nt|mcphee: E can now find the @H lead to 3N which will cause a moments grief untill declarer sees dummy:)|pg||
nt|april7: 2 or 3NT? or is 2NT Lebensohl?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i can live with a simple 1@s overcall|pg||
nt|jcwla: Sorry - back.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: oh brasilians method|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 2@C Gazzilli I suspect|pg||
nt|rich89: some imp for italy here i think|pg||
nt|yuval10: 2@c probably gazzili|pg||
nt|rich89: y gazzilli|pg||
nt|yuval10: if they can find the excellent slam|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 2@d-2N-3@s-4@d might do it|pg||
nt|haans: as long as its partials its ok|pg||
nt|yuval10: but i think he should've known that S has at least 3 @s's ( P didn't support ) and at least 7 @h's so 3 @c's can barely fit into declarer's hand|pg||
nt|pierced: for me dbl show single @s|pg||
nt|yuval10: X was perfect|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: sorry for all the mistakes, but this laptop is screwing things up|pg||
nt|petergill: At least we Aussies have our regular partnership EW. The scratch partnership in the team of five is NS at the other table. |pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: 3@C was @S raise|pg||
nt|sybarra: undoubled, that is good news |pg||
nt|ady: even undoubled  east west will lose several imps|pg||
nt|haans: spade Q lead :)|pg||
nt|othered1: 650 is a really nice result, since you can be beaten off the top with @S lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: may see N come in?|pg||
nt|othered1: 2@S is high enough, but east may get to a lawful 3.|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|yuval10: OR led @d, let's see if they'll lead it again here|pg||
nt|yuval10: perhaps will opt to a @s|pg||
nt|h_karluk: seems bidding directions are wrong|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: nono, I bid correctly|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Only 180 degrees|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: cards are wrong. North is dealer but east has the west cards etc|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Not me|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think N would buy to 2@s|pg||
nt|szalay: double, pls|pg||
nt|chick: lebensohl sequence here|pg||
nt|yuval10: 2NT follows by 3@s i believe to ask stayman with @s stopper|pg||
nt|haans: 2 suits to cover |pg||
nt|haans: a good bid now is xx|pg||
nt|haans: if u have talked about it|pg||
nt|haans: dealy = no map |pg||
nt|chick: what would you play XX as, if you were S?|pg||
nt|xenya: tough for NS -- looks like they are in for a minus score now no matter what they might do|pg||
nt|po-s: - and if it means what you have agreed...|pg||
nt|haans: that would help|pg||
nt|yuval10: i only have pass and direct 3@s here.... Pass force for XX from S|pg||
nt|haans: hi sudden|pg||
nt|haans: how to find 5@D|pg||
nt|april7: true|pg||
nt|mcphee: and even seeing dummy may not make life so pleasing|pg||
nt|ritong: wb jordan|pg||
nt|yo_yo: now it is home|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: doomed|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Rotten suit|pg||
nt|h_karluk: we will see likely or not, time to watch the process|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 3 jump encourages|pg||
mb|4C!|nt|vugraphzeg: north and south also switched cards|pg||
nt|pelu: spects : 9-1 for pass :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: Kib avg age, Peter? :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i cannot use a double there because of @s Ax, i know the ovecall suit quality is not bright there |pg||
nt|haans: very like bidding prempt after prempt |pg||
nt|ady: this will be a slaughter|pg||
nt|haans: you just dont do that|pg||
nt|sybarra: and its j high with no good spots!|pg||
nt|hawe45:  In OR, South was no junior - passed in first hand, is that allowed in a junior-match?|pg||
nt|szalay: does anyone know meaning of bids?|pg||
nt|daman: no reason for South to bid|pg||
nt|chick: the OR has only played 5 boards (per the Movie), so it may be more than 30 minutes :)|pg||
nt|haans: fight every board|pg||
nt|xenya: anyway they reached a nice contract |pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: W: I hope you have really bad cards|pg||
nt|sybarra: puts pard (Nab) in difficult position |pg||
nt|othered1: I hate to lose 6 imps.  |pg||
nt|h_karluk: no worries please, you go well|pg||
nt|xenya: what if NS have the @SA?|pg||
nt|yuval10: then P has A@h|pg||
nt|yuval10: or A@c|pg||
nt|yuval10: or any other entry|pg||
nt|xenya: hopefully, yes|pg||
nt|petergill: 2NT GF Jacoby |pg||
nt|ralfwil: can be a little bit difficult if E cant show his 5-4 in @h and @c|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@H extras, no singleton|pg||
nt|haans: need special responses to j|pg||
nt|petergill: cues, 1st or 2nd round control|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: to me good lead, could cost worse to a @d lead|pg||
nt|daman: who is foing the yelling now?|pg||
nt|daman: doing*|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: still the Italians|pg||
nt|mcphee: uh oh accident|pg||
nt|haans: may get 2nd chance|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Whibley will run for home|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|haans: boring :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: thought he might come in over 2 @D |pg||
nt|yuval10: in 25, N indeed opened 2@h but EW managed to reach the top spot of 5@c|pg||
nt|h_karluk: maybe the question should be how did they dare 4@h in vuln, i don't think they were dying to be victims while no obvious game for EW|pg||
nt|h_karluk: in nonvul|pg||
nt|yuval10: just made and 3 imps to Israel that dodged a bullet there|pg||
nt|xenya: on 25, the French reached 5@C -- a better contract than 3N -- losing 3 imps|pg||
mb|4D!|nt|sharkey: the players probably took the wrong cards out|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: nope they all took their own slot|pg||
nt|sharkey: score 33-0 to Denmark and more to come...|pg||
nt|chick: in an auction like this, I would play 4@C as Stayman, but no idea what they do|pg||
nt|sybarra: yikes guys!! |pg||
nt|haans: Haans: who plays J whit KJx Walddk4: A good player does, Hans, and Volcker is doc_jo: is volcker a good player??? ->doc_jo: Roland say and Roland ... |pg||
nt|haans: puppet|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i cannot blame Tarnovski plays solo with such holding and vulnerability|pg||
nt|h_karluk: however i would demand @d J instead of stiff @c J|pg||
nt|ritong: he tried his best to push them a level higher and succeeded|pg||
nt|h_karluk: true|pg||
nt|ritong: wish him to resist to the @c jack shift|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: hmm, I think N is worth a cue|pg||
nt|rich89: lol|pg||
nt|h_karluk: agreed|pg||
nt|haans: cue will not find grand|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: I confess I could pass as East automatically|pg||
nt|szalay: over 1@C|pg||
nt|daman: they just got +100 from thin air|pg||
nt|xenya: W has his hope i think |pg||
nt|yo_yo: maybe Nabil thought 3@C stronger than lebensohl 2NT?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: omg they bought 5@h|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, all.  but in context of gazzilli how/what wouldnorth cue?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|sybarra: may make 6 now |pg||
nt|haans: holy ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: too much technical stuff for me, i only know on/off button and how to use a mouse :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: you're advanced Hamdi...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: omg, after long years i learnt to use email system:)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  What is e-mail...?|pg||
nt|sharkey: ask Hamdo hans :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: ik heb een geheel gedraaid spel. Kan je een arbiter roepen?|pg||
nt|sharkey: Hamdi|pg||
nt|h_karluk: at start i thought, some guy's name in Venezuala, bcos i saw a video abt it |pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: tell oops was trying to contact someone else in the building|pg||
nt|hawe45:  And you might invite with 4 NT directly also|pg||
nt|szalay: well done Brigitta|pg||
nt|rnmalik: some imps coming your way with X also|pg||
nt|szalay: she wears the jeans|pg||
nt|marlowepi: expect trunmpo lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: std. puppet auction |pg||
nt|ralfwil: I think this is easier with Stenbergs Hans?|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: pass is the hardest bid to master in bridge :)|pg||
nt|szalay: light openings and overcalls they style can live cause another side|pg||
nt|ady: heart shift  best|pg||
nt|rnmalik: no other choice I think|pg||
nt|ady: hand 16 where west was down 1 in 4@H doubled   in OR  n/s made 4@D re-doubled|pg||
nt|ady: was 11 imps for world team|pg||
nt|rnmalik: compensation here for NS might gain some|pg||
nt|pelu: 4 out of 5 : I am junior :):)|pg||
nt|haans: psych|pg||
nt|jcwla: 16 means 12 big ones to Israel - they made 2@S N/S here and 5@C E/W there|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Hi Ed|pg||
nt|yo_yo: too difficult to find a @S lead|pg||
mb|4N!|nt|hawe45:  Wonder what 1 @S was - since East introduced a suit with 7-6-5-4 at the 4-level|pg||
nt|ritong: since declarer would exclaim " hey my big gin card"|pg||
nt|h_karluk: http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/    enjoy guys :)|pg||
nt|petergill: It looks like 6@h to me - EW will be unable to identify the singleton club opposite the ace|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: I think to open 7-4 in white is good bridge, regardless of your age|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Now South likes his hand|pg||
nt|szalay: in white/red 4@C is an option, imho|pg||
nt|haans: i think not|pg||
nt|petergill: West too strong to splinter|pg||
mb|5D!|nt|h_karluk: could also play for divided @d honours|pg||
nt|h_karluk: seems preferred 3-3 35/6 %|pg||
nt|haans: 4th 5th spade|pg||
nt|hawe45:  That was what I tried to indicate..!|pg||
nt|chick: lucky for declarer, @SJ10 fall|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Still 2 losers|pg||
nt|szalay: likely 500 and 12 imps for Hungary..and: new leader:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: de Pagter wondering out loud whether Hop should've bid 2NT|pg||
nt|szalay: 1@S was: comp values, at most 3@S|pg||
nt|haans: need relay bidding|pg||
nt|petergill: Good point|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: we can follow jacco - just finsih the hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: true but the other table played the hand it was supposed to be played|pg||
nt|sharkey: Makes on low @C lead...|pg||
nt|haans: opinion: gronkvist: they must cancel the board gronkvist: will the laws says so|pg||
mb|5N!|mb|p|nt|szalay: u wont punish for light openings cause light overcalls and vica versa|pg||
nt|szalay: why not to take @C in hand?|pg||
nt|szalay: to start @D ruff?|pg||
nt|frankaus: maybe planning on a dummy reversal|pg||
nt|po-s: there is a narrow path perhaps to go down|pg||
nt|haans: still you have @D to K|pg||
nt|h_karluk: needless to say obvious losers there|pg||
mb|6H|nt|sybarra: he may be thinking same thing,  maybe played too fast |pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: Now they're all saying I'm junior to me :P|pg||
nt|szalay: the tipical terrible "fashion-convention"|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: 1@s showing less than 4 @s's, 8+ hcp|pg||
nt|szalay: it looks 800 now|pg||
nt|daman: they should be hugging each other|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: not in their  blood i think|pg||
nt|marlowepi: making 5|pg||
nt|mcphee: i bet they do not play leb there or there would be no reason to pass 3@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: North gave dbl of 3N a thought|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzeg: I could led the right guy lead but he led small club|pg||
nt|daman: nah  that's true|pg||
nt|h_karluk: he got @h count now, not hard to draw the big picture in his mind, won't be tough defense in his perspective|pg||
nt|ralfwil: response 3@c positive and a 4-card suit. After checkingg aces W can see 13 tricks|pg||
nt|haans: ralf strong argument|pg||
nt|petergill: Or 1@H - 2NT - 3@C balanced extras, to save space, allowing 4@C, 4@D or 3@S by West to show singletons with hand too strong to splinter. Or something like that. |pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Then I think, that East had minimum for his 4 @C-bid...!|pg||
nt|xenya: strange line of play|pg||
nt|haans: most in sweden play like that Peter|pg||
mb|p|pc|cK|nt|vugraphzeg: I love how 3/10 are people I know|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @d K ?? :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: yep|pg||
nt|haans: a spade please|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: they like nice clothes and to yell|pg||
pc|c2|nt|pelu: the problem are not 13-14 HCP - but the bad suit|pg||
nt|daman: and gelato|pg||
nt|po-s: I wonder if this was a Lebensohl situation for NS - 3C showed some values|pg||
nt|haans: and if you did CHEATING?????|pg||
pc|c3|nt|h_karluk: ok sir, thanks :)|pg||
nt|chick: yes, switch the @S8 and 7, different story|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|ady: now K@C and club|pg||
nt|h_karluk: okay, say you entered the score, it helps to see in comparison? |pg||
nt|hawe45:  Not allowed|pg||
nt|po-s: yes but obviously declarer was afraid of getting a diamond played from North|pg||
pc|hK|nt|h_karluk: well, seriously i do not think we can have ideal conditions at all times|pg||
nt|h_karluk: how they say? umm - lesser evil <my review>|pg||
nt|Walddk4: That's what pre-empts are for, but I don't think Edgtton had a serious problem with that hand|pg||
nt|h_karluk: soon east would be endplayed with a careful timing|pg||
nt|haans: opps in the dark|pg||
nt|szalay: the East probably didnt read Rodwell interview:|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think they play auto doubles|pg||
nt|po-s: his alternative would be 3NT|pg||
pc|h3|nt|szalay: to take trick first and think thereafter isnt a good omen|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sybarra: why not pitch ht|pg||
nt|sybarra: or is that the exit card?|pg||
nt|daman: East is in trouble |pg||
nt|marlowepi: trump lead will cause N to go right in spades|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|haans: lavinthal for @H?|pg||
nt|haans: juniors back to teach :)|pg||
mc|13|nt|rnmalik: @H pitchwas better but kept an exit card|pg||
nt|marlowepi: good duck by E|pg||
nt|haans: only 1 spade loser|pg||
nt|haans: so boring|pg||
nt|petergill: Yes, there are Swedish responses to Jacoby, American responses to Jacoby, and all sorts of other responses to Jacoby. Even Oswald Jacoby himself did not play Jacoby the way it is ...|pg||

mb|p|pc|c5|nt|Walddk2: It seems wrong to me that you play 230 boards to get through to the semi-finals, then run the risk of being knocked out over just 24 boards|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The semi-finals should have more boards imo|pg||
nt|ritong: 2NT was certainly a kind of relay to know more  3NT is 5422 or so|pg||
nt|marlowepi: going back to the previous hand, it was not essential for Eto have 4 clubs in order for the grand to make. if his club jack were the diamond jack for example, 7 would be cold even ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: with 3523 or 2533|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Would that mean an extra day's play?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not necessarily, Liz, as the last segment in the final starts at 17.00|pg||

nt|h_karluk: final board|pg||

nt|ady: thx all|pg||
nt|sybarra: Thanks also to our specs who give us helpful comments and some humor!|pg||
nt|szalay: does West have way to show @D lead?|pg||
nt|szalay: or may be HIS lead, even better:)|pg||
nt|ady: if west is on lead to 3NT  may choose a heart when east has shown majors|pg||
nt|szalay: a bit optimistic, but acceptable 5@C|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 7/5/1 long time not seen|pg||
nt|haans: 1@C mbs?|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@s in OR = 5 card @S + a minor|pg||
nt|rnmalik: no denying |pg||
nt|szalay: as many specs asked:|pg||
nt|xenya: something in that, yes -- if @Cs are 3-2...|pg||
nt|sybarra: Thanks also to my co commentators Simon, Hans, Roland and Po.  We appreciate your time, insights and humor.   |pg||
nt|h_karluk: seems a flat one|pg||

nt|sybarra: we are back in about 1/2 hour |pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: yes play went very fast here so that is why|pg||
nt|szalay: fast play seldom means good|pg||
nt|frankaus: fine operating Jacco <clap> <clap> <clap> <clap>|pg||
nt|szalay: I think South has INV with @Cs, lets say 3@C is normal or 2N...|pg||
nt|pelu: by West|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Strange, that 6 NT went down - you have 12 tricks with safin the @D-suit and take the losing @H-finesse|pg||
nt|szalay: South is female and 16-years old only|pg||
nt|szalay: 3@D was Rubenshol: @Hs, inv +|pg||
nt|szalay: doubt West wd pass it|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: 3@D Switch, rather|pg||
nt|szalay: switch: dom and sub in one?:)|pg||
nt|szalay: South of course passes|pg||
nt|sybarra: LOL,  it was HOP,  I just followed what was on profile  |pg||
nt|mcphee: i think if N had @H stop they just bid 3N don't you?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i am OK with 1@h|pg||
nt|po-s: Adam shows that pass is never an option|pg||
nt|mcphee: providing 3@C shows somethng|pg||
nt|tomi2: this was a very fast session|pg||
nt|ritong: kind of an achievement to go down in 3@s|pg||
nt|vbman: kiwis did well|pg||
nt|sybarra: Special thanks to Kees Tammens and Hans van Staveren, and sponsors Max Abram, Herman Drenkelford, Peter Sisselaar and Jos Janssens.|pg||
nt|sybarra: and last but FAR from least Thanks to our specs who give us helpful comments and some humor!|pg||
nt|haans: with u|pg||
nt|haans: but...|pg||
nt|othered1: If you play south's pass forcing, shouldn't you alert it?  and if you don't, can you risk it?|pg||
nt|sybarra: N needs to say X |pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Kiwis?|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: Aussie nick ;)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Kiwis are New Zealanders|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: whatever, same part of the world =)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: thanks to fellow commentators, our operator Erwin and kibbers visited this room, see you tomorrow, bye for now, take carte buddies! :)|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|vugraphzeg: it was west thinking but i try to do 2 bids at a time|pg||
nt|sybarra: this looks like it should make |pg||
nt|szalay: r u sure?|pg||
nt|xenya: i wonder|pg||
nt|szalay: 1@S, 1@H and how many @Cs?|pg||
nt|ady: looks like west has mis understood partners bid|pg||
nt|szalay: its Molenaar's double session|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: west might have explained this as weak with @d|pg||
nt|h_karluk: imho 5@c unbelievable|pg||
nt|haans: 3 down in 5@Cx|pg||
nt|haans: 2|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 2@C is not an overbid|pg||
nt|h_karluk: could any lead a trump from QT - say to 5 clubs contract? :)|pg||
nt|haans: 3@Dx|pg||
nt|szalay: thx all, it was fun, and interesting|pg||
nt|szalay: probably West, her screenmate is trhinking|pg||
nt|szalay: am I right?|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: correct|pg||
nt|szalay: Danke|pg||
nt|rnmalik: absolutely and difficult waters for EW|pg||
nt|szalay: 4@S RKC or rather cue?|pg||
nt|szalay: muddy waters, rather|pg||
nt|sybarra: next match: israel-Neth. blue|pg||
nt|haans: 20 min to next session|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: thats in about 20 min from now.|pg||
nt|sybarra: Our gratitude to the NBB for brining this wonderful tourney to BBO.  |pg||
nt|h_karluk: bye, see you in next match|pg||
nt|haans: easy 4@H|pg||
nt|yuval10: board 26 - EW playing 3NT in the OR, and the lead was.....@c from N|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: possibly 3@s would come|pg||
nt|xenya: http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=85&Itemid=79 for standings after 9 rounds|pg||
nt|haans: we thank you Shirley :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: Our gratitude to the NBB for brining this wonderful tourney to BBO.  |pg||
nt|sybarra: Special thanks to Kees Tammens and Hans van Staveren, and sponsors Max Abram, Herman Drenkelford, Peter Sisselaar and Jos Janssens.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: traditional - bid your suit!|pg||
nt|petergill: Aussies with a recent ex-New Zealander - Michael Whibley has recently moved from New Zealand to Australia |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Do these people know the danger in getting an Aussie and a Kiwi mixed up? Can be fatal...  a spectator points out|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: glad I'm sure Andy won't kill me :)|pg||
nt|haans: mandatory South say|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|szalay: I think its going down for @S lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: yikes!!  here we go again|pg||
nt|szalay: 6@C for sure|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: East wasnt passing, I could tell you that|pg||
nt|xenya: E seems to have taken partner's 4@C too seriously|pg||
nt|h_karluk: what would you lead vs 5@c ? @h A/K or @s A+x ? :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: @C|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT the easiest as they lay    but likely to play 5@C  which would certainly go down to a trump lead   4@H can make|pg||
nt|haans: at last|pg||
nt|daman: thanks to th NBB for letting us bring this to you    thanks also to the Sponsors|pg||
nt|sybarra: Special thanks to Kees Tammens and Hans van Staveren, and sponsors Max Abram, Herman Drenkelford, Peter Sisselaar and Jos Janssens.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: bid 7S, get trump lead, double squeeze|pg||
nt|yo_yo: NS got into the bidding in the other room|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i played 4@d different. in my old cc just send here (multi)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our next match will be USA vs Israel|pg||
nt|yo_yo: now this can make|pg||
nt|ralfwil: all 13|pg||
nt|yo_yo: on the fortunate split in @S suit|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes  all the tricks |pg||
nt|h_karluk: 3-1 50%. 2-2 40% (@s) 9 cards |pg||
nt|h_karluk: bye for now, enjoy|pg||
nt|petergill: It's similar to muddling a Dane and a German, or an Irishman and an Englishman|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: Dutch and Belgians ;)|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: E likes his hand|pg||
nt|haans: game at or|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i do not believe my eyes, 4261 with 6 hcp and 3@d 3rd seat both nonvul :)|pg||
nt|davidb: not a  lucky decision |pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: anyone dare interpret this auction?|pg||
nt|haans: a make (i think) :)|pg||
nt|haans: missed hearts so will we know|pg||
nt|sybarra: Special thanks to Kees Tammens and Hans van Staveren, and sponsors Max Abram, Herman Drenkelford, Peter Sisselaar and Jos Janssens.!|pg||
nt|haans: but no @SQ so no 7|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: the Next match broadcasted will be Australa agains Worldteam (Japan/czech combination)|pg||
nt|sybarra: Thanks also to our specs who give us helpful comments and some humor!|pg||
nt|ritong: not even 6 other room  extremely prudent|pg||
nt|marlowepi: cautious juniors--what is this world coming to?|pg||
nt|haans: :) good one :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E has to cue now|pg||
nt|haans: rkc|pg||
nt|marlowepi: especially if 2S showed six, and/or if not playing 3N vs. cuebid distingishes serious from nonserious slam try|pg||
nt|h_karluk: bye, c u next segment|pg||
nt|mcphee: Adam looking to get some back or give some away:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: Thanks also to our specs who give us helpful comments and some humor!|pg||
nt|othered1: but south's lead was a low @C so ducking first club is simply double-dummy|pg||
nt|haans: what delayed u|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|haans: dbl gazzili like bid?|pg||
nt|ady: not likely to play 4@H|pg||
nt|frankaus: have you heard my view on playing 5 minor contracts?|pg||
nt|ady: managed 3NY OR|pg||
nt|ady: OR|pg||
nt|h_karluk: esp when N showed his interest on unbid suits (the reds)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: sorry there were a huge misjudgement|pg||
nt|sybarra: might we try 3 @C now?|pg||
nt|pelu: ther5e are 8 "top" tricks - but not when u take @cK (see the 10) and run @cJ :(|pg||
nt|ady: must have got club position wrong in OR  to go so badly down in 3NT     low club and when 10 appeared went up with king and finessed 9|pg||
nt|pelu: 0,1 sec late, David :)|pg||
nt|ady: yes    you are too quick for me Peter|pg||
nt|haans: hearts right|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Spades are blocked but still only 8 tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Declarer's best chance is to duck at trick 1|pg||
nt|haans: wai'th with @CA|pg||
nt|haans: 2-2 in red|pg||
nt|haans: ? 18-19 or good @D?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I don´t know when this convention was played in USA, but a team in Gothenbutg playen 2nt  frocing with trumph support already in the early 1950 decade|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: if u travel across the World, better to agree 2suiter overcalls|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: the problem was the semi natural 1@c openingbid i think|pg||
nt|szalay: if a bid (semi)natural, better to treat it as natural, eg. to play (1m)-2m as Michaels vs. prepared 1m yet|pg||
nt|sybarra: likely to misguess hts here also |pg||
nt|h_karluk: obviously - east players happy with that 7 hcp|pg||
nt|yuval10: maybe too much for a 4-3-3-3 hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: 4@S cue|pg||
nt|szalay: I predict -1 and Hungary's win|pg||
nt|yuval10: this is the last board of the 10th round now|pg||
nt|chick: S is likely to get endplayed |pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: declarer didn't play for endplay but just claimed on 2 finesses|pg||
nt|yuval10: you can hardly endplay him|pg||
nt|daman: and thanks to BBO    without them we would not be able to watch this|pg||
nt|tomi2: Tarnovski will think "I dont understand this auction" but he does not care, he is dummy :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: aha 16-8 now|pg||
nt|yuval10: so looks like a hugh swing for France and it is|pg||
nt|yuval10: 15 imps|pg||
mb|3N|nt|szalay: but grand slam try with missing ace was a mistake, anyway|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: 1430, I guess|pg||
nt|xenya: admittedly, he does have a great hand|pg||
nt|szalay: nbo pressure for N-S now|pg||
nt|szalay: the real issue is 3m is nat or stopper asking|pg||
nt|haans: not to happy with @H lead|pg||
nt|ady: in what   4@H?|pg||
nt|haans: nt|pg||
nt|frankaus: its like kissing your own sister - even when its right ---- its hard to get excited about your prospects|pg||
nt|szalay: any bet?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Good defense now and we have a new leader:)|pg||
nt|szalay: every dutchman says: he will make it|pg||
nt|szalay: btw, this is the last board of set and last set for me|pg||
nt|szalay: thx all your patience, it was funny, anyway|pg||
nt|xenya: no defense, however good, will work if declarer gets @Hs right|pg||
nt|szalay: that is what bet about|pg||
nt|szalay: bt w to play safety @H in good direction is risky:|pg||
nt|szalay: he could lose 2 @Ds and a @H|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hi Vladimir:)|pg||
nt|szalay: so better to play for @H to king and small one, imho|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Rashed:)|pg||
nt|szalay: do u agree?|pg||
nt|xenya: thanks everyone|pg||
nt|po-s: why not|pg||
nt|chick: don't have to, it's automatic|pg||
nt|po-s: why would you need to - in 5H defenders helped a lot|pg||
nt|haans: sry|pg||
nt|sybarra: Thanks also to our specs who give us helpful comments and some humor! |pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Is this result correct from =R - 10 tricks with two @H-losers and 3 potential trump-losers?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  From OR|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But still|pg||
nt|haans: they may still be relaying|pg||
nt|haans: ops|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: Lotan looked at me very disappointed|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if you are going to bid 4S, at least do it in tempo|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Dane and Swede even worse|pg||
nt|yo_yo: off on a @S lead |pg||
nt|yo_yo: but  too difficult from K|pg||
nt|petergill: At least two players of this French team number 2 has won World Junior Championships, in Beijing in 2008|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Gothenburg plaued sry:)|pg||
nt|haans: did not stenberg play it in 50th?|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: time for @S switch yet, and likely 2 off|pg||
nt|szalay: c u in 30 minutes|pg||
nt|szalay: byebye|pg||
nt|pelu: now 25-0 could be 25-24!|pg||
nt|haans: hung is trying to show his strength|pg||
nt|ady: yes Netherlands good comeback|pg||
nt|Walddk4: If he thinks he has that strong a hand, why did he not reverse into 2@H?|pg||
nt|ady: well the 2 club rebid did not exactly convey the hand|pg||
nt|haans: his opinion for a long time|pg||
nt|davidb: to leave the X . 3D  is ok for  juniors openings|pg||
nt|rnmalik: might play small from table to 9-safety play|pg||
nt|ritong: ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: like he bid like an old man|pg||
nt|marlowepi: or someone who was once an old man:)|pg||
nt|ritong: and made his duty|pg||
nt|petergill: 2NT 6+ @D and 3@S, at least invitational|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: thanks, you interpreted my feelings :)|pg||
nt|szalay: it will be push, thx all, c u soon|pg||
nt|h_karluk: thx buddy, c ya soon|pg||
nt|szalay: so from 52 cards 5@H is makeable now|pg||
nt|daman: the next session is scheduled for 12 minutes from now|pg||
nt|yo_yo: oh my goodness  can you see the other result on board 6?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and now-1|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes! astonishing with no @s lead!|pg||
nt|haans: we do not know when Jacoby invented it When we was allowed by ACBL to play it|pg||
pc|hA|nt|haans: once again holy ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: a-ha North pushes his opps to game|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 4@C er helt ude i hampen|pg||
nt|frankaus: may escape  with -2|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: south asking west what double means|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: west doesnt have a real clue|pg||
nt|sybarra: how about "I think we can beat the contract"  as an answer|pg||
nt|Walddk4: And they can|pg||
nt|ritong: there is no reason to bid quickly, since west must pass 4@s no matter what|pg||
nt|haans: not forcing p may pass with Qx in spades|pg||
nt|sybarra: really|pg||
nt|sybarra: ??|pg||
nt|haans: that is my opinion|pg||
nt|othered1: OK,if partner's allowed to  judge, it's normal.  Otherwise forcing pass on first round at 2-level is alertable, isn't it?|pg||
nt|haans: thew stronger spade the less does p have|pg||
nt|haans: he|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@C asks for shortage I think  3@H = singleton @H|pg||
pc|h3|nt|xenya: but S preempted -- that may be a factor|pg||
pc|h6|nt|sharkey: Sac vs 3@H?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: there were a passed hand double and imho showed @h+@d|pg||
nt|pelu: the problem is that the X from = @H, so 2@h is what??|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Maybe that's too simple|pg||
nt|haans: we have said neither|pg||
nt|pelu: so play: X = dont lead @s|pg||
nt|Walddk4: but will they?|pg||
nt|ritong: some would pass, somewhat stupidly, thinking " no double no trouble"|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|xenya: this stands no chance of course -- let's see if he can get out for -1|pg||
nt|ady: high spade likely lead|pg||
nt|pelu: some play after opp has shown 2 suits, that a bid here is sopper and no stopper in the other suit|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hope they make postmortem especially about this board|pg||
nt|sybarra: ht lead spade thru?|pg||

nt|pelu: in S some play RD = I am not sure we sh play 3Nt and Pass = OK with me|pg||
nt|szalay: I just said: its not the percentage line|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|frankaus: bed time here back latter in day european time|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: yes this happened, north couldnt play south for 4@D|pg||
nt|xenya: i doubt that -- W's clubs are too small|pg||
nt|xenya: setting up @Ds would mean seetting up trump tricks for N|pg||
nt|sybarra: cu frank @H |pg||
nt|xenya: but i overlooked the fact that the defence had presented E with a trick -- now he certainly can make 11 and must be thinking how to get 12  |pg||
nt|sybarra: this doesnt look too tricky for declarer |pg||
nt|po-s: spade please|pg||
nt|mcphee: thanks all for watching|pg||

pc|d2|nt|h_karluk: however their maters scored +620|pg||
nt|haans: all card for opps|pg||
nt|othered1: that sort of implies that the worse their contract, say in terms of total trumps that they hold, the less likely it is that you can double them.  Funny correlation.|pg||
nt|sybarra: that is interesting Ed |pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: director is telling that the next match starts in 5min|pg||
