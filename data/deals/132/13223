mb|2S|mb|4H|nt|chick: good, because some sessions with this machine have been very dull :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jpmbs:  hi everybody|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: 4@H seems a little unilateral to me, opposite a passed partner|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ralfwil: hi jeroen|pg||
nt|chick: Hi Jeroen :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzeg: wb Jeroen|pg||
nt|benjent: 4@h looks kind of ok single dummy, but the evil @s & @d breaks are going to create some problems|pg||
nt|jpmbs:  nice contract to start with|pg||
pc|s3|nt|benjent: The defence have to be careful. For example, if North tries a low @s at trick 2, declarer is in good shape|pg||
nt|benjent: The cleanest defence is to play trumps. North would like to do that, but he'll be thinking about whether he can afford to overtake the @s9 with his weak @s pips|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a trumph switch will break|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s7|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a @h switch is not so difficult from S either|pg||
nt|benjent: And now it's a very hard task for South to find the @h switch|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d7|nt|benjent: from his point of view, it's not clear that @d ruffs is a major threat|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d2|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But with only @hQ8, only an enpassant is a trick|pg||
pc|s4|nt|benjent: For all he new, with his poorly placed @cK, the defence needed to cash 2 @d tricks ... and partner's @s5 at tricks one might have suggested a @d switch|pg||
pc|d4|pc|h8|pc|s6|pg||

mb|1D|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|othered1: north will probably get in at whatever level|pg||
mb|d|mb|3D|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|benjent: One defence South might have tried was to try to cash 2 @d's ending in North's hand to get a @s through for the trump promote|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dQ|nt|chick: 21 HCP game, but it will work|pg||
nt|benjent: Meanwhile, back at the ranch, 4@s is a pretty good contract but beatable on a @c ruff|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d7|nt|ralfwil: will go down if EW take their @c ruff|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|othered1: East can overtake to force it, but would west read it as doubleton?|pg||
nt|benjent: West might find the low @c switch now, just as an ordinary kind of defence|pg||
nt|ritong: east should have took this to revert to @cs|pg||
nt|benjent: I think it's better for East to duck as he did - the @c is kind of an obvious switch|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I think E should have taken over and returned a @c|pg||
nt|chick: a low club at this point might not look very attractive, given no info about partner's club shortness|pg||
nt|ritong: taken*|pg||
nt|othered1: @H looks more obvious to me|pg||
nt|chick: Ralf has it right, E must show the club ruff possibility|pg||
nt|chick: (and Henri) :)|pg||
nt|Walddk3: You cheering for France, Henri? :)|pg||
nt|ritong: np|pg||
nt|benjent: If East overtakes the @d and shifts to a @c, it will look very much like a singleton|pg||
nt|ritong: naaaah:)|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Must be a nice situation for you|pg||
nt|Vugraphzeg: As a kib points out, the @D7 is often played as s/p here, and W has all the low cards but the 4, he might get it right|pg||

mb|1S|nt|benjent: But how likely was East to have a *higher* @d than the 7? Pretty likely - and you better your booties he would have signalled as hard as he could for a @h if he had the K|pg||
nt|Vugraphzeg: I guess we can say nice @DT by Volcker, though it might've been unintentional :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|2N!|nt|chick: For the kibs:  The comparison scores are not necessarily correct for this match ... the Closed Room is a different match, so we won't know the actual score in this match until the ...|pg||
nt|chick: end.|pg||
nt|ritong: it was completely intentional, although a bit of a routine card|pg||
nt|Vugraphzeg: The closed room results are entered manually actually|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|chick: ah, so they are the right scores for this match?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzeg: The other room is the other SF|pg||
nt|benjent: General principle - as declarer, signal what YOU want. Here, the defence should be playing suit preference with the singleton @d in dummy, so signal the @h shift you want by ...|pg||
nt|benjent: playing the 10|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|othered1: Just be suge you use the opponent's methods of signalling|pg||

pc|d4|pc|d5|pc|s2|nt|benjent: I think I can summarize in one word - "ouch"|pg||

nt|chick: @C2 asking for @D back|pg||
pc|c7|nt|chick: now he will lead @C7 to ask for @H back|pg||
pc|sK|nt|benjent: I think he could have played his @c face down and Grosset would have known what to do :)|pg||
pc|d6|pc|c9|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pc|h3|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: interesting|pg||
nt|ritong: what will fred lead?|pg||
pc|c7|nt|benjent: um .... @c7|pg||
pc|c2|nt|benjent: I confess I would have led a @d|pg||
nt|ritong: reluctantly, i guess  AQxx is about the worst possible lead for french people|pg||
nt|othered1: I wonder if south had a power double available, not that it would be a good bid?|pg||
nt|benjent: I think you could have left "french" out of that|pg||

pc|c3|pc|cQ|pc|c5|pc|c6|pg||
nt|Vugraphzeg: Heya Henri :)|pg||
nt|ritong: salut bas:)|pg||
nt|benjent: There are some people who like to open 1-strong-NT in 3rd with not so strong hands |pg||
nt|benjent: Grue & Wooldridge are an example I think|pg||
nt|ritong: they are welcome when vulnerable|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h2|nt|benjent: For those pairs, it's handy to have a power X in your arsenal!|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|d4|pc|d5|pc|dA|pg||
nt|benjent: Not to be unkind, but I think Volcker is pursuing the worst of all possible defensive strategies|pg||
nt|benjent: Namely: lead some suit, then when that doesn't work, lead some other suit, then when that doesn't work, lead some other suit|pg||
nt|benjent: Eventually he's going to run out of suits to switch to :)|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h8|pc|h9|pc|hQ|pg||

nt|ritong: key hand coming|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|nt|benjent: 6NT from South is sweet, from North it could be a little sour|pg||

mb|6N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ralfwil: Will N see his hand as a max-hand?|pg||
nt|jpmbs:  Thk so|pg||
nt|ralfwil: He did!|pg||
nt|benjent: Spotlight on Francesche ... can he find the @c lead|pg||
nt|ritong: it is max|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ralfwil: but a @c kead....|pg||

pc|hK|pc|h5|pc|h3|pc|hA|pg||
nt|benjent: Interesting choice of lead ... I wonder what his reasoning was|pg||
nt|jpmbs:  agree|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|pc|d7|pc|dA|pg||
pc|h6|nt|benjent: I guess he wanted to go safe, but a @s lead, especially 10 from 1092 is a long way from safe|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hT|pc|h2|pg||
mc|12|pg||
qx|o18|st||md|4S7632HA943DJ7C732,S5HK862DQT94CAQ86,SAQ98HQTDAK863CJ9,SKJT4HJ75D52CKT54|sv|n|nt|benjent: I think the choice is between the minors ... leading from 10xxx can blow a trick in a variety of ways|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If W had @sK perhaps a D, as he know, that 6nt is an accepted invite slam|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1D|nt|benjent: leading from xxx is unlikely to blow more than a 2-way guess, and is therefore probably the safer of the 2|pg||
nt|benjent: I think if you gave this hand to every player in this field, the majority would find the @c lead, but many would be finding it for safety, not so much to try to get a trick|pg||
mb|1N|mb|d|nt|benjent: That's a very good point Ralf|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: with the @h Ace in hand, the majority would say " coinflip to hit my pard s potential trick" imo|pg||
nt|othered1: Do you act on north hand?  How? (1@S isn't unattractive to me)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|Vugraphzeg: I was just considering if I'd bid 1@S or 1NT Ed|pg||
nt|benjent: Of course, if partner has a @s trick, it's relatively likely to be always coming to you|pg||
nt|jpmbs:  he wants points back|pg||
nt|jpmbs:  and will|pg||
nt|ralfwil: what card do you play as W? @cQ I hope:)|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cQ|pc|c9|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cJ|nt|benjent: @s switch is best, but some kind of impossible to find|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|pg||
pc|c6|pc|d3|nt|benjent: Although here East could have ditched @cK under the A to try to get partner on the right track|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c7|pg||
nt|jpmbs:  they should have|pg||
nt|benjent: Right about now, I reckon East is wondering what he's going to lead to trick 5|pg||
pc|cT|pc|s2|pc|c8|pc|d6|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I had plöayed a @c back to @cK and after that I could read how defence should be|pg||
nt|ralfwil: played....|pg||
nt|benjent: But first he has to curse himself for not unblocking in @c's :)|pg||
nt|jpmbs:  Defence lot more tough now|pg||
nt|Vugraphzeg: To unblock he'd have to had led the K or T|pg||
pc|d5|nt|benjent: or just play one under the A|pg||
nt|othered1: More like to get the shift than unblock|pg||
nt|benjent: North's pair of @d pitches have suggested the @d switch pretty strongly to East|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ralfwil: E can decide that after a small @c back to @cK|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dA|pg||
nt|benjent: To escape even a little, I think declarer is going to have to run @hQ to West to take out his entry|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I think N will play a small @s now|pg||
nt|benjent: Play for the @sK on side. How direct :)|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|s3|pc|s5|pg||
nt|jpmbs:  best chance to get some spade tricks, not here though|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sT|pc|s6|nt|jpmbs:  guess 500|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dJ|pc|dQ|nt|benjent: Running @hQ has the advantage that if it loses, East becomes likely to hold the @sK |pg||
nt|ralfwil: best play is to exit in @d|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|benjent: yep, endplay Grosset for a mercy @h trick|pg||
pc|d8|pc|h5|pc|h3|nt|jpmbs:  than KofH...|pg||

pc|h9|pc|hK|pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|benjent: Kibs point out you can play East for @hK as well by exiting in @s's ... which places West with a pretty poor hand. Judgment call for Bessis|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|ritong: 1NT looks ok with this flat hand|pg||
nt|othered1: open the south hand and go minus here.  Still unlikely to stop low enough|pg||
nt|chick: and a very tight match|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|benjent: Would we all invite game with South's 4333 gappy 11 count? At green vs red?|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c5|pc|cT|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|othered1: 109 in partner's suit and a partner who rebid after a 3rd seat opening, yeah I'd get pushy|pg||
nt|chick: well, he does have nice intermediates|pg||
nt|benjent: I'd really like a medium @d raise. South's life would have been much easier if North had rebid 1NT (easy pass), but that's obviously anti-system for them|pg||
nt|ritong: pard did not open 1 NT third seat at fav, he s not supposed to hold pleasant 14|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pc|s3|pg||
nt|othered1: 1@S rebid doesn't promise balanced shape, so inference on NT opening isn't very strong.|pg||
nt|benjent: Neat @sj from Volcker - playing the technically correct double-finesse against Q and 10 of spades through West|pg||
nt|ritong: on the other hand, if pard is shaped, he will bid again over 1 NT|pg||
nt|benjent: It's actually the @s6 which makes it the correct play!|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @sA wasn´t best for the defence. Before winning with @sA he had to know what he wanted to play next|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c8|pc|c6|pc|c2|pg||
nt|benjent: May have been nervous about winning the next round of @s's and really being stuck|pg||
nt|benjent: It may have been wiser for him to just exit the @s10, having won the A|pg||
nt|ralfwil: not so good in a close match!|pg||
nt|benjent: Back on the bidding - Henri, are you saying that in their system, South could have safely bid 1NT?|pg||
nt|ritong: i say that it is a close decision|pg||

mb|1C|mb|1D|mb|d!|nt|benjent: 3rds and 5ths, or 3rd and low? Hard to see how the @dA couldn't wait to check on the @c situation|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3@d on W?|pg||
mb|2D|nt|ralfwil: do you all like 2@d?|pg||
nt|ritong: i do not advocate the @d switch, just trying to explain it|pg||
nt|othered1: matter of style.  A little strong for 3@D in many methods and a bit flat for a "mixed rasie"|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|benjent: Oh, I understood Henri - I certainly didn't think you were voting for the @d switch|pg||
nt|benjent: I would play 3@d here as about an Ace worse|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|benjent: Hmmm .... Volcker's double-crossing himself a little here|pg||
nt|othered1: For me, if west were an ace worse, he'd need more @D length and shape.|pg||
nt|benjent: 2@s was probably going to be a perfectly acceptable contract in the 4-3. 3@h could be a 5-0 for all he knows|pg||
nt|ritong: by the way, i think NS have a strong advantage in this situation playing the last boards of a relatively important tourney with 600+ kibs  as we can see, east tends to  play ...|pg||
nt|ritong: quickly and instinctively|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and 3@h must be forcing - or?|pg||
nt|othered1: could 2@s be forcing, assuming dbl showed only @H?|pg||
nt|benjent: There's a very wide range of ranges for jump raises in these situations - and a vast menagerie of methods to go with it|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d5|nt|benjent: 4@h is not ridiculous, but it will be unsuccessful|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dA|pc|d8|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|benjent: Last board at this table I believe - although not the last comparison to come in|pg||
nt|ritong: dangerous hand|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ritong: contestable:)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: ????|pg||
mb|2D|an|*|mb|d|an|*|mb|2H|mb|2S|nt|chick: both of the unscored hands look likely to be flat, so this will be France2's last chance to even it up |pg||
nt|Vugraphzeg: Sorry, I hope everyone's heart's still beatingg :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|Vugraphzeg: Beating even|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|benjent: I have a hard time believing 2@s was the right bid by North|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: a simple cue|pg||
nt|benjent: To my eyes, Volcker said "I'd really like to defend some vulnerable doubled contract"|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|benjent: And how could Bessis know that that was not their best plan?|pg||
nt|ritong: west bid 2@h freely|pg||
nt|othered1: As long as south absolutely guarantees a rebid over 2@H.  does he?|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|pc|hA|pg||
nt|benjent: But 2@h could be made with zero spades and one heart. So long as you are confident that pass is forcing, then North has an easy forcing pass|pg||
nt|Vugraphzeg: Lots of chit chat going on at the table continuously, including people poking their heads under the screen|pg||
nt|ritong: setting up the glue for the rest of the auction|pg||
nt|Vugraphzeg: I wish my French was as fluent as theirs :)|pg||
nt|benjent: My rule in these attempted penalty auctions is that we are in a forcing auction unless the opponents jump (which is when they really demonstrate a fit)|pg||
nt|chick: Bd 23 was flat, as predicted, and this one is likely to be also|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Last board in this set, so Thanks all and see you at 15.00|pg||
nt|othered1: that style in penalty auctions looks reasonable.  Are the opponents entitled to know about it and how would they get this arcane bit of information?|pg||
nt|ritong: current score is fr243 fr1 49 i guess|pg||
nt|benjent: Interesting question. I think you have to be wise to the idea that auctions such as this may be forcing and ask|pg||
nt|benjent: Down at the local club against the weaker players, we take the trouble to over-alert and explain as much as we can, but I think experienced players should be expected to have a ...|pg||

nt|othered1: As an opponent it would be nice to know that I may be in more danger bidding 2 than bidding 3.  And what would it say if west asked that question?|pg||
pc|c4|mc|9|nt|benjent: Bessis was protecting against J10xx(x) club in the pocket|pg||
