nt|ralfwil: Good afternoon everyone|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: The Levy team has opened a commanding lead|pg||

mb|1N|nt|jcwla: Hi, Quentin.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Good afternoon, everyone|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hi, Liz.|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|daman: looks like a normal 3NT fvor EW?|pg||
mb|2C|nt|vugraphzxs: hi|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Good morning all|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Good morning|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: looks like EW can make 4@S...|pg||
nt|cuttysark: An exciting board to start|pg||
mb|2D|nt|sharkey: W has a problem now - 3@C may have been better than x|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I am quite impressed with the 1@H overcall - don;t think I would bid such a bad suit in the sandwich position|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|daman: would 2NT show 16?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|sfoxa:  Hello, Liz. Hi to all.|pg||
nt|xenya: i don't think 2@H is meant as forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: invitational|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: A fast auction to the normal spot: South rebids her spades to show at least 5, North denies support|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: negative diamond lead looks best|pg||
nt|vugraphzxs: Good morning|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Indeed - seems to attack communications and wait for tricks in the other suits|pg||
nt|garnetts: Good morning all |pg||
nt|ady: good morning David|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Spades lie quite well for declarer, who will probably look for tricks there|pg||
nt|cuttysark: (and good morning, Louis and Davids)|pg||
nt|daman: otherwise she could transfer|pg||
pc|d5|nt|cuttysark: Swift auction to the gran slam -|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Looks like 2 down, a small save against 400|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sharkey: View N has @SK) the spots are good enuff to pull trumps|pg||
nt|sharkey: @SK9|pg||
nt|jcwla: Looks like 4NT is the ask, 5@S shows two with the @CQ, 5NT shows the presence of all key cards, and 7@C is made with the side source of tricks.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mdgraham: agree. A 1@S overcall is an attractive possibility, as that is the suit you would like partner to lead|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|ady: seems only realistic play is QX spades with east|pg||
nt|xenya: where's the 9th trick|pg||
nt|daman: can make 9 tricks double dummy|pg||
nt|daman: a low @D now will give him 9 perhaps|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|nt|cuttysark: She is unlucky in her finesses|pg||
nt|jcwla: 15 tricks at notrump, but at IMPs the most important thing is to get to the grand.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Indeed, if all the aces are present it is hard to imagaine a hand with no play for the Grand|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ady: diaond continuation seems best|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|daman: on balance   it will be a struggle|pg||
nt|xenya: let's see -- N wins and switches to spades...|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cT|pc|c6|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|s5|nt|cuttysark: But 5@S may be more expensive if they find the heart ruffs, so she has done well|pg||
pc|sA|nt|garnetts: this works quite well |pg||
pc|s7|pc|s9|pg||
nt|ady: best now to cash diamonds and king and another spade|pg||
pc|cK|pc|s8|nt|sharkey: natural @S trick...|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Communication very difficult - it would be so much easier if her clubs were like dumy's spades|pg||
nt|garnetts: cashing diamonds and hearts priot to exiting with the last heart is as good as anything|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I think I would prefer a takeout double|pg||
pc|c7|pc|sT|pc|h2|nt|ady: all sees to lead to down 1|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|sharkey: ruff @C @SQ and @D finesse...|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Defence can always get 2@s 1@h and 2@d in my opinion|pg||
nt|lestergold: Good afternoon all|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hello MIke!|pg||
nt|lestergold: Hi Raif|pg||
nt|daman: hey Mike|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dK|pc|d8|nt|garnetts: they do but what else can you do apart from stopping in a partscore |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  Hello Mike. Can only add, that if they could have a method to show both majors in this position...|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Mike|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|cuttysark: Hoping for the doubleton queen - not much else to play for, as you said at the start|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pc|h7|pg||
nt|lestergold: It is my pleasure today to find myself commentating on my friend and customer of many years Catherine Fishpool|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|h9|pc|d7|pc|dA|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hJ|nt|mdgraham: It would certainly lead to a different auction, but NS likely to find 5@C |pg||
pc|hK|pc|h8|pg||
nt|daman: doink    claim|pg||
mc|9|nt|xenya: apparently N didn't know S held 5 spades|pg||
nt|lestergold: Catherine has a reputation for liking penalty doubles so we will see if she lives up to that|pg||

nt|sharkey: 1 NT by E - may be final contract?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Maybe after minors it is not so clear - 2@D Michaels?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Anyway, she has reduced the lead by 3 imps|pg||
nt|daman: giving or receiving?|pg||
nt|daman: :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|garnetts: true but there was a more obvious end play |pg||
nt|ady: 4@S an excellent game for e/w|pg||
nt|lestergold: giving them|pg||
mb|1C|nt|sharkey: dont think NS will enter into the fray VUL|pg||
nt|xenya: repeated spade leads would have beaten 3N i think |pg||
nt|daman: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: not enamoured with the 2@C overcall prefer 1NT |pg||
nt|cuttysark: Looking at the NS hands, 4@H is pretty good - sinks on the 4-1 break|pg||
nt|ady: even with spade king offside can make if getting diamond position right|pg||
nt|garnetts: 4@H is unlucky to fail |pg||
mb|2H|nt|sharkey: S thinks otherwise|pg||
nt|cuttysark: When I was commentating yeserday there were a lot of slams - here we go again|pg||
nt|mdgraham: The trick here is to avoid the 7-level|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  Players are getting more and more aggressive entering against strong 1N openers|pg||
nt|daman: 2@H must be 5-4 majors and weak|pg||
mb|3N|nt|cuttysark: Now West needs to set up a game-forcing auction, set hearts as trump, and find out that partner has the right controls|pg||
nt|xenya: however it was made in the other room too -- so that wasn't too easy |pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: Nice 4@S bid here to help them avoid getting too high with W not holding any @S's.|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: well well !!!!!!!!!!|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 3@H is a Fit Jump - shows clubs as well as hearts|pg||
nt|sharkey: View S and E totally combine for 30 HCP+ S is lucky to catch this good a dummy|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Important to discuss the difference between 3@S and 4@S after a 2-level response|pg||
mb|p|pc|sA|nt|cuttysark: In Acol she could make a strong jump shift to 2@S, then bid 4@H to showthis hand|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South raising to 3@D would make things awkward - now West can cue-bid 3@D|pg||
nt|lestergold: a very thin contract which we can see can be defeated double dummy|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s7|nt|ady: west came in late    will be pleased with dummy|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|cuttysark: When opponents have a double fit.... so do you|pg||
nt|daman: too bad dummy didn't have 10x of @C|pg||
nt|lestergold: the heart switch is very far from obvious here|pg||
nt|lestergold: ironically it can still be defeated providing Fishpool does not continue spades|pg||
nt|xenya: once again, 9th trick can't be readily found|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|henryb:  I am not sure it is wise. On this hand South will make 110, but she would have made 100 on defense|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s4|pc|d4|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Asking about spades she will find that the queen is missing and avoid the Grand...|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|nt|daman: this will be easy now   |pg||
pc|dK|pc|d7|pg||
nt|cuttysark: And, having bid all 5 denominations, she finally reveals her heart support at the 6-level!|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mdgraham: well, AK10x is adequate support|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|nt|garnetts: I acnnot believe that she played a club--will south be able to read it |pg||
nt|ady: down now with diamond played|pg||
nt|garnetts: South will think she has six spades maybe--|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Norths diamond lead must be a singleton |pg||
nt|cuttysark: (Easy for me to see, I guess, but why else lead dummy's suit?|pg||
nt|jcwla: I would take 3@S as setting trump and asking for control bidding.  A jump to game seems more of this type of hand: nothing but @S's but an opener rather than a preempt.|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s5|pc|s3|nt|garnetts: Oh dear|pg||
nt|xenya: NS have 5 tricks now -- can they get them?|pg||
nt|lestergold: well  very cheeky contract let thru because Fishpool was frightened of giving more awayby switchimg|pg||

nt|cuttysark: If you put your mouse over the Closed Room contract you see their auction|pg||
nt|ralfwil: W could have set up more pressure on NS by taking the 6 @c tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Well, Reess team need IMPs so have to do something.  So far this worked out|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Flat board. Auction at the other table did not really address the spade issue, it seems.   |pg||
nt|cuttysark: QUite similar  but over 1NT West could bis a forcing 3@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: hard to beat 3NT here|pg||
mb|2S|nt|lestergold: however 4@h may well be the contract|pg||
nt|daman: 4@H by East would be a struggle|pg||
mb|d|nt|sharkey: Misfits coing up...|pg||
nt|jcwla: Rebid 2@H or 2@S here?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|cuttysark: Another brave bid, from South this time|pg||
nt|daman: same auction in the CR|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: 5th highest lead clarifies the count in diamonds for everyone|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I prefer 2@H because that may be where we want to play - I would need better spades for 2@S|pg||
nt|jcwla: Yeah, the @S's look like five, don't they?|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ady: some might have competed with 2@S with east hand   vulnerability may have beeb influential|pg||
nt|daman: they led the @S Queen in the CR|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sfoxa:  yes, S can hope to find at least 1 fit|pg||
pc|d2|nt|cuttysark: I wonder what that double means - if penalty it is a big view|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|sharkey: EW can make 5@D I think; have to work on @S suit - not @H.  3 NT easier....|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Hi all|pg||
nt|henryb:  E-W can make game, but only game in either red suit. I agree with Canonne that West is worth a reverse, but it may be hard to keep Clement from overreaching to slam|pg||
nt|sharkey: hi Hamdi|pg||
nt|sharkey: W forced to bid 3 NT now?|pg||
nt|xenya: re previous hand: 3N cant be made even if declarer puts in the @DJ -- suppose she runs the clubs and plays the @HK -- N wins and cashes the @SQ squuezzing declarer out of the 9th ...|pg||
nt|xenya: trick |pg||
nt|lestergold: yes an interesting position i didnt see it |pg||
pc|h2|nt|garnetts: a bit of a coffee hand now---maybe a lot of players would double 2@H with the East hand--I would have risked 2@S |pg||
nt|cuttysark: A low club lead and a couple of heart ruffs would have been an exciting defence|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hQ|nt|sharkey: After West's reverse 3@S must be forcing....|pg||
nt|sharkey: sry - East's 3@S|pg||
nt|henryb:  Clement obviously thought 3@s was forcing. Canonne thought she had done enough opposite a misfit|pg||
nt|sharkey: this may not make either....|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c5|pc|cA|pc|c4|pg||
nt|lestergold: that heart play was it 100% safe?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|cuttysark: But even this useful looking spade position is not enough for declarer - cannot ruff 2 diamonds without establishing East's @S8|pg||
pc|d5|nt|jcwla: A common adage is not to double partscores into games at IMPs unless expecting a two-trick set - hard to see how E could have that level of confidence.|pg||
pc|h5|pc|d3|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|henryb:  I agree with Canonne, and think that Clement should make a more positive noise over 3@h|pg||
pc|d6|nt|sharkey: @C and more @C will doom declarer|pg||
pc|h8|pc|dT|pg||
nt|lestergold: if south held Jx@s?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: not with @sQx or !J on S|pg||
pc|d9|nt|cuttysark: Clear to compete in 4th seat - not so clear in the middle of a live auction when South could still be very strong|pg||
pc|d7|pc|s4|pc|s2|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c2|nt|lestergold: exactly highly possible|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c7|pg||
pc|cK|nt|henryb:  she after all has three diamonds for her partner's six card suit and @hAx for the five card suit|pg||
nt|h_karluk: there are two forms of reverse, normal and high, counting eleven in red suits with a minimum that's not close any of that. 2@d could be more reasonable rebid.|pg||
pc|cT|nt|jcwla: The one thing you don't want to do on a board such as this is bring back -470.|pg||

nt|cuttysark: I guess there may be more action at the other table...|pg||
nt|ady: e/w should end in 4@H|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think that one should open 1@d, and that partner should make allowances for a high card stretch when opener shows 5-6|pg||
nt|sharkey: Levy lucky in CR - need @S lead to set this|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it could have been worse - NS might have been in hearts on the 6-2 fit |pg||
nt|lestergold: but couldnt as cards lay|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: set 4@H|pg||
nt|ralfwil: wrong tempo if she wanted to guard a 4-1 in @c|pg||
nt|lestergold: slam on the heart position which sadly is wrong|pg||
mb|1S|nt|jcwla: 1@D-1@H-1@S-2@C (forcing)-2@D -- now E may take over and get them to the @D slam.  @H's also possible but less likely.|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  actually, if QJ @d would have been third...|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: 24/16 and interesting score on CR. Wait a minute please, Arent there 2x2 losers on M suits please?|pg||
mb|2C|nt|cuttysark: And EW could make 2@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: This hand is everyones 4@H contract--a spread too|pg||
nt|sharkey: on Bd 2 where S ventured 2@S EW played 1 NT down 2 in CR; thus no gain from daring 2@S overcall|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: push|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: play should be quick|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 2NT opener - possibly upgraded to 20 because of the good suit - makes it very easy to reach the easy game|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I am told they are playing in 3@S in the other room|pg||
pc|c8|nt|cuttysark: West may decide to show her doubleton heart now|pg||
nt|daman: this is a pianola hand    tome for more coffee|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sharkey: East on lead - @S lead not too attarctive...|pg||
nt|henryb:  At the other table East chpse to lead a club against 4@h and one of the spade losers was quickly thrown away|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|sharkey: Some may have raised on West's cards to ensure @S lead....|pg||
nt|daman: time*|pg||
pc|s2|nt|cuttysark: Looks like an accurate stop - provided the defenders cash their clubs there are 5 losers|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ady: defenders will need to cash their 2 diamond tricks when in with A@H  or there will be an overtrick|pg||
pc|sK|nt|cuttysark: Or not :)|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s6|nt|h_karluk: Say you stop in 3@h and your opps find killing @s lead, then you proud of yourself and smile about nice stop. However, once you reached the fat that impossible 4 made then you ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: think that's not fair. Sometimes good bidding punished while bad bidding rewarded|pg||
nt|jcwla: I like the 3@S -- knows they have a safe home in @D's and E may (and did) really want to hear about the @S card there.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: probably nine tricks here - NS unlikely toi switch to clubs when they win the @SA|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s7|pg||
nt|ralfwil: is 3@s a slam tempo in their bidding and 4@s fast arrival?|pg||
pc|s5|pc|d6|pc|sA|pc|sT|pg||
nt|lestergold: for roland it would be a clearcut slam|pg||
nt|daman: the latter I'm sure|pg||
pc|hA|nt|h_karluk: *fact|pg||
nt|jcwla: As expected, the 3@CX making has brought Reess a bushel of IMPs (and the lead).  In the CR, W played 2@S quietly making with an overtrick.  Pigeaud's 2@C overcall paid big ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: dividends.|pg||

nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
pc|h5|nt|garnetts: ??????????|pg||

nt|daman: the silence is deafening|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If it¬¥s my only chance to act - yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: one of those exciting things - if West had opened 1@D, NS would not have bid to 3NT |pg||
nt|cuttysark: 5@C is beaten y leading 3 rounds of diamonds, and so promoting a trump trick.|pg||
mb|2D|nt|garnetts: if partner has A@C then fine if not then she has the K@D |pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|cuttysark: You can look it up - go to Movie and click on the result|pg||

mb|p|nt|xenya: i see nothing wrong with the double|pg||
nt|lestergold: with 4@h and an opening bid however min i would double the opening bid for sure|pg||
nt|daman: EW can make at least 3 H and probably more|pg||
mb|3S|nt|cuttysark: Looks a normal 2@H - she has enough to keep the bidding open in case partner is quite strong|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: over D 2H F/NF , that's the question |pg||
nt|henryb:  I too would bid 2@c, but E-W had an ENORMOUS number coming on defense|pg||
nt|jcwla: W's 2@S rebid should show this type of hand and these extras.|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Tough problem for West now|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|ady: seems like 3NT some sort of relay?|pg||
nt|garnetts: she had 3 so ducking was best --Thanks Liz|pg||
nt|jcwla: W has an awfully good hand even in context but gives partner some leeway and another really nice auction by E/W.|pg||

pc|h7|nt|cuttysark: East-West have realised that they have two club losers, and stopped safely in game|pg||
pc|h6|nt|cuttysark: Could 3NT be the dreaded Serious Slam Try?|pg||
nt|sharkey: many play 2@H after 1@S - Dbl - 2@H shows good @S raise|pg||

nt|lestergold: may have pushed n/sto the unmakeable 4@s|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|nt|henryb:  I think the modern approach is to play forcing at the one level and transfers at the two level. This sacrifices the natural 2@c response but gaains lead directing raises and the distinction between constructive and weak raises of opener's suit|pg||

pc|c4|nt|h_karluk: obviously opps would reveal their suit/s|pg||
pc|s3|pc|c9|nt|henryb:  West had a minimum distributional opener, so 2@c seems normal.|pg||

nt|daman: I disagree Ralf|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a style of bidding|pg||
nt|lestergold: it is a standard hand as recommended by Robert Owen in doubles for takeout penalties and profits|pg||
mb|2H|mb|3D|nt|ralfwil: For me is a second double weaker thah this hand|pg||
nt|daman: if I double and bid a suit     I would have a stronger hand|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|ady: south should transfer  and pass at 2@H|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and BBO has a great service to compare. Here it is : http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph_archives/vugraph_archives.php?command=all|pg||
nt|jcwla: Do you prefer 3@S or 4@H?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I think 4@H does not get the hand over, but am not keen on the splinter with the singleton king|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|pc|cK|pc|c5|nt|h_karluk: another great service is : http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/   you can watch all rooms in same time|pg||
nt|jcwla: Bergen advocates splintering even with stiff A or K - many disagree.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: North now committed to slam, hoping there are not 2 spade losers|pg||
nt|jcwla: Meanwhile, N might have investigated with 5@D, but would have had a lot of company with 4NT and the no-2-losers wish has been granted.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: anyone for a 2@H rebid rather than 2@d?|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hK|nt|ady: declarer needs to take care   if hearts are 4-1   might get tapped out with club lead|pg||
nt|sharkey: looks like this may be off 2 |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  I vote for 2@h |pg||
nt|cuttysark: Question of style - but the suit strength would persuade me towards 2@H|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ralfwil: for me strong enough and why not 1@s from S over 1@d?|pg||
pc|dT|nt|cuttysark: Again, she is establishing diamonds before drawing trump - cannot afford to lose control of the trump suit when they can force dummy to ruff clubs|pg||
nt|sharkey: off 1 now |pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Maybe we should unblock @HK before ducking the diamond|pg||
pc|h9|nt|sharkey: W wud have to shift to low @D 2nd trick for a @S thru - later S wud finesse for @D Q.....|pg||
pc|h2|nt|cuttysark: And we might discard @CK instead of ruffing the spades|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hJ|pg||

pc|d2|pc|d4|nt|sharkey: S had the opportunity to ditch a @S on @CK when in dummy|pg||

nt|cuttysark: But all wil be well|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  so 2@h looks better, but it's definitely matter of style|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Reess team gaining a number of small swings |pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|nt|sharkey: NS likely to get to 4@H - EW can sac in 5@D|pg||
mb|1H|nt|sfoxa:  I think, if you play 2NT strong, W hand is worth this opening. 1@s may face pass, and for game forcing - not enough a little bit|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: for off 3|pg||
nt|lestergold: at any rate not coffee break time for sure|pg||
nt|daman: unh unh|pg||
nt|xenya: what does N feel now, seeing the 1@H bid?|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4@h at this stage|pg||
nt|daman: warm and fuzzy|pg||
nt|lestergold: but that will not end auction|pg||
nt|ralfwil: do you all bid 1@h on S?|pg||
mb|4C|mb|4N|nt|xenya: i do|pg||
nt|daman: oui|pg||
nt|daman: 4NT should show long @Ds with secondary @Cs|pg||
mb|d|nt|sharkey: West missed her chance to bid @D|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  but this tiem, E has normal response|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Another example of the 'do you open NT with a 5card major?' question|pg||
mb|5D|nt|garnetts: brave overcall in the sandwich position |pg||
nt|h_karluk: counting nine on C suit twice finesse - no reason|pg||
nt|mdgraham: threatening lead|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I would be quite worried if it wne t 1@S All Pass, so put me down for 2NT|pg||
mb|5H|nt|cuttysark: Well. you got close|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|ady: e/w likely to get too high|pg||
nt|garnetts: this looks like one down |pg||
nt|cuttysark: Looks as if West will just ahve to pass and hope for the best|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no, sorry, they are in 4@S - thought it was 3NT|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Those playing 5card Stayman would reach 4@S even after opening 2NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: that helps to pitch any loser of doubletons, so one gets 12 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: with open cards you can mahe 6@d!|pg||
nt|daman: they are in 6@D doubled in the CR|pg||
nt|ralfwil: sry make|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c4|nt|ady: last chance of a plus for e/w was to pass 3@HX    not easy|pg||
pc|cA|nt|cuttysark: To me it seems that if East had enough for game opposite this hand she would have reopened eith 3@H rather than double - but it is a question of partneship style|pg||
nt|ady: west has run    and is right  3NT  expensive    4 clubs down 1|pg||
nt|garnetts: that will not get doubled |pg||
nt|garnetts: would have better off letting them be in 3NT |pg||
nt|cuttysark: She had 7 tricks in 3NT, so only 2 down :)|pg||
nt|ady: 3 hearts should be down 1    but very difficult to pass the double for west|pg||
nt|sharkey: easy game Hamid :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: NS have 27 HCP one would buy 3N but who|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|dA|nt|garnetts: maybe that is why it is better to pass than to open with that hand |pg||
pc|d7|nt|sfoxa:  this game is easier - no need to gues @h, just establish @d |pg||
pc|d6|nt|garnetts: KQ stiif not that good and the clubs are just so so |pg||
nt|sharkey: Perhaps East shud have raised @D?|pg||
nt|jcwla: I think many would feel this too strong for 2@S in third white on red.|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I think I would have bid 3@C rather than 2@S to indicate that I had opened with 6 clubs and a poor hand|pg||
nt|h_karluk: to show lead|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dQ|nt|cuttysark: Defenders can get a ruff, but with a trump trick, and no communication for any further ruffs|pg||

nt|h_karluk: for EW could be|pg||
nt|jcwla: Another thing that may have happened there is that W "gave E room" for a third-seat white-on-red and did not get involved.  As E I might want W to get involved there.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: I would expect North to bid 3@H over 3@D with any reasonable 5card suit - 3@H is not a great spot here, and even playing lebensohl, that's where you reach after the double|pg||
mb|1D|nt|garnetts: 3NT or 5@C makes --maybe get too high in 6@C?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: likely 3N|pg||
mb|1H|nt|sharkey: indeed|pg||
nt|daman: this will end up either 3@D for NS   or 3@H for EW|pg||
nt|daman: sorry   3@S  NS|pg||

nt|daman: yes|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2H|mb|2S|nt|ady: 5@C  or 3NT   both should make for n/s|pg||
nt|sharkey: no alternative|pg||
mb|3H|nt|mdgraham: 2@c does not seem necessary facing a strong no-trump|pg||
nt|cuttysark: On Board 9 North in the CR did open 1@S instead of 1NT and so missed game|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  in playing non-forcing stayman, W can afford such a try|pg||
nt|daman: making 6@D in the CR|pg||
nt|daman: doubled|pg||
pc|d7|nt|cuttysark: North should ot get too excited with no high cards in partner's suits|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT   better as 5@C  might go down if 10@S was with east and a spade led|pg||
nt|sharkey: 10 tricks - next....|pg||
nt|sharkey: or may be only 9|pg||
nt|xenya: quite a feat|pg||
nt|daman: on the double finesse     which stood out on their auction|pg||
nt|lestergold: wow that must have taken some inspiration!|pg||
nt|daman: just the auction|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dQ|nt|cuttysark: South could bid 3NT now to show a half stopper: with a real stopper she would bid 3NT last time|pg||
nt|ady: not sure what 3@S shows?|pg||
nt|jcwla: With the nice fits 4@H makes in comfort while 5@C goes down just one.|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|cuttysark: East has taken partner very seriously - I presume 2@C must show at least invitational values|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  seems so|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes. Hard to see why East doubled 3@C otherwise.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I am surprised South did not double with her club support and 2 aces|pg||
nt|daman: Levy should take the lead now|pg||
pc|hA|nt|cuttysark: Doubt, I guess :)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  afraid of 4@h?|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h4|nt|garnetts: good point Liz---I imagine 3@S is alittle like fifth suit forcing |pg||
nt|garnetts: not sure what to do|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I guess this can be made - but it does require a few good views|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think north had a six @h insurance bid if they bid the slam|pg||
nt|daman: that would have been my philosophy too|pg||
nt|xenya: was a swing for Reess?|pg||
nt|daman: sorry     Rees won the IMPs|pg||
nt|daman: yes|pg||
nt|daman: got my colours mixed up|pg||
nt|lestergold: north ahould have realised that her spade honiuyrs were under the ciosh and that he heart length meant that hearts were not cashinbg |pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c2|pc|c3|nt|garnetts: well done |pg||
nt|ady: seemed to have reached a reasonable spot|pg||
nt|mdgraham: maybe I will be in a minority, but personally I think 1NT-all pass is just fine|pg||
nt|mdgraham: still, if 1NT is 16-18 West might pursue a game if there is a major suit fit|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  it's definitely better than 3NT, but W has to demonstrate magician skills to prevail|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|lestergold: my expereicne on these hands is that you simply do not have the defence you hope you had|pg||
pc|d3|nt|garnetts: it is an effective  sequence |pg||
nt|ady: no spade lead an easy ride|pg||
nt|garnetts: claim time after this trick |pg||
nt|ady: must say the pace of the game for this event has been very good|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Noticeable that the French players do not slow down the game - a pleasure to watch|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mdgraham: opposite a 15-17 strong NT, dubious|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Hugh Kelsey had a theory that partner would ahve a 4card major more than half the time, so it was worht using Stayman to improve the partscore|pg||
nt|cuttysark: But that only works when Stayman can be weak|pg||
nt|mdgraham: hmm 4333 and 4432 hands will surely have majors half the time and minors half the time?  |pg||
pc|h7|nt|cuttysark: East is thinking about her defence now - but there will be no post mortem between deals|pg||
nt|garnetts: The sequence is interesting because it would seem that 3@C showed real support and denied foru spades or South would have tried for game there |pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sK|pc|sA|nt|lestergold: in otgher words oppos usually make these slams|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|h_karluk: as M leads barred, maybe @c J would be better to start, how about in same layout N has @c T..wow|pg||
pc|dT|nt|sfoxa:  sometimes even 4-3 major is played better that 1NT on 18-20 points|pg||
nt|cuttysark: He had some mathematical proof - but it rarely seems to work at the table :)|pg||
pc|d9|pc|hQ|pc|dA|pg||
pc|s2|nt|cuttysark: That is true - it pays  at Match Points to look for some kind of major suit fit|pg||

mb|p|nt|h_karluk: 2N consumes space|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: I think 2 NT describes her hand very well|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: I am trying to construct a sequence to slam! West needs to show a game-forcing 3card raise now|pg||
nt|daman: sorry   the West hand :)|pg||
nt|daman: I would have tried at least 3@C|pg||
pc|cT|nt|garnetts: it is true that 6@C relies upon club position on this hand but it would not if West hand another spade--so when a slam is at worse 50% you should be i n it|pg||
nt|sharkey: Struggle to make this|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ok w had bal 11, how abt opener, bal/unbal, limit/reverse values? so i recommend 1D for W|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 2@D to play in partner's major|pg||
nt|lestergold: this will require carful play|pg||
nt|daman: you pass those hands and the opps start to push you around|pg||
pc|c2|nt|cuttysark: 2NT an attemtp to compete in the minors|pg||
nt|jcwla: W did not raise initially (some would have) but now does not sell out, showing both minors with longer @C's with 2NT.  Now N has a dilemma with a flat hand.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|lestergold: ten tricks are there|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|s3|nt|cuttysark: I wonder if 3@H is forcing in their methods - after all, they could show a 3card limit raise without mentioning spades|pg||
nt|cuttysark: West cannot go past 5@H because she has no diamond control|pg||
nt|ady: tht that was the n/s method   e/w the same?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Perhaps East is worth a jump to 3@C at her second term - the spade bid has improved her hand|pg||
nt|garnetts: I meant 6@H not 6@C |pg||
nt|cuttysark: (Term=turn)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: must pick up the @sQ|pg||
pc|c8|nt|cuttysark: Presure again - shee needs to guess clubs to make this if they switch to spades|pg||
nt|mdgraham: quite brave of East to protect|pg||

nt|xenya: good start -- still looks tough?|pg||

nt|h_karluk: 2N still in the box sir :)|pg||

mb|3H|nt|daman: would we bid with the West hand?|pg||
nt|xenya: not me|pg||

nt|garnetts: interesting choice of bids for East |pg||
nt|xenya: i just wouldn't know what to bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sharkey: pros and cons for most conventions. you assumption you want the 11-12 HCP hand to take charge - by bidding 2 NT you let the other hand decide|pg||
nt|daman: pass by East was ill-conceived|pg||
nt|daman: 5@C is by reflex|pg||
mb|5C|nt|garnetts: I prefer 1@S to 2@C --hate two level with only five cards |pg||
nt|xenya: yes, but still in deep trouble|pg||
mb|d|nt|daman: whack|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: I hate to overcall a minor when I have a good 4-card major, so I am afraid I would double and hope partner did not bid diamonds|pg||
nt|garnetts: Double also an option |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|h9|pc|h2|pc|hT|nt|cuttysark: Or indeed, bid 1@S as you suggest, David |pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I don't think our suggestions would get us any higher than the actual overcall :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: 4@S actually has real chances |pg||
nt|daman: same contract in the CR      South opened 4@H with that hand|pg||
pc|hK|nt|h_karluk: while minimum 23 is at our side why i am supposed to be in a hurry ?:)|pg||
nt|jcwla: Many want both extras and five clubs for 3@C so S settles for the 2@S rebid and hears the @D control she wanted.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Another slam - though the heart break makes this one 'interesting'|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Good lead|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  good decision by W - after such bidding, @s could be the weakest point of NS|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  anyway, it attacks communications|pg||
nt|cuttysark: It is nromally right to lead the major after a 1M response - or dummy's second suit, but that is not tempting from Ax|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  agree with non-@c lead|pg||
nt|cuttysark: One thing sure - South has diamonds well covered|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East knows South has two cards higher than the four, so may well return @S10 after the ace|pg||
pc|s4|nt|jcwla: Looks like a 0314 response and S will likely next ask for the @SQ with 5@D.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: with best play from W -3|pg||
pc|s9|nt|mdgraham: (Rule of Eleven)|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|cuttysark: But when you bid a Moysian 4-3 they often break 5-1 or 6-0 - too much to handle :)|pg||
nt|xenya: 4@H might easily go down -- cash 2 diamonds and switch to clubs|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|sfoxa:  9 imps for reess in board  13 - passed 1NT next door|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 'Normal' to return 4th highest, but here imprtoant not to make it easy for declarer to duck |pg||
nt|cuttysark: Still needs to regain the lead if South takes @SK now|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s8|nt|cuttysark: Now she can discard one heart and ruff the other and make her contract|pg||

nt|mdgraham: going for diamonds |pg||
nt|daman: well     honestly   I would finesse @Cs|pg||
pc|c3|nt|garnetts: that is possible--haven't analysed it too closely--just looked as though it was not much wors that 4@C |pg||
nt|jcwla: With the hidden extras and only the @SQ missing among key cards, S takes a shot at slam - now to make it.|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|d3|pc|d2|nt|ady: if you play a diamond to establish a discard  another trump can be played and a 3rd trump when losing a heart|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Yes - you would play the heart first in case the hand with @DA had only 2 spades, but it doesn't work on this layout|pg||

mb|p|nt|cuttysark: I have lost count of the 7=card suits in this set!|pg||
nt|daman: 3NT for E here|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: Not much chnace of avioding a slam here--might get too high in 7@C |pg||
mb|2N|nt|h_karluk: time passes quickly, if i am not dead wrong playing tempo a bit got high there|pg||
nt|sharkey: S may "try" somethin here...|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|ady: but if the spades were 4-2    still would be difficult to do everything and set up clubs without losing control|pg||
nt|cuttysark: The 'semi-forcing' 2@C - like an Acol 2-opener|pg||
nt|garnetts: This 3@H bid  might show a hand which has less than normal high card values but a good suit and shape |pg||
nt|h_karluk: a gambling 3N|pg||
nt|cuttysark: How many spades should West id after the Michaels overcall showing both majors?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: i would have thought - more than 2!|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  vulnerable - could be 2|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Known 5-4 fit and a doubleton in the second suit - her hand could be much less suited to play in spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: Cannot think why North didn't bid 3@D earlier|pg||
nt|ady: tht 3@H showed a no loser suit   |pg||
nt|sharkey: Obviously the opening lead makes a difference....|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  if partner has something special, she can bid again|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Unless they play Michales as 5-4|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: H lead or switch -> S history!|pg||
nt|cuttysark: North showing a heart stopper in case partner guards spades and can bid NT|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|cuttysark: Odd time for North to intervene - surely better to get in before they have bid any 'real' suis|pg||
nt|garnetts: It would in traditional methods show a solid suit but not here I think |pg||
nt|mdgraham: West catches up|pg||
nt|daman: would it be wise to play the Queen at trick 1?|pg||
nt|daman: or does it really matter?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: only if @hK is on side:)|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h4|pc|hA|pg||
nt|garnetts: Unless that is tghe new standard for solid |pg||

pc|d4|pc|d3|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||

nt|ady: west playing partner for club suit and singleton heart?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: This can be fatal|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c4|pc|c5|pc|d2|pg||
nt|garnetts: I fear that EW had no real idea what they were doing here--the 5@C bid looks very strange to me |pg||
nt|sharkey: tie board - off 3 and 3@H makes EW?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so 2C was a better choice as seen|pg||
nt|jcwla: This could be a huge pickup for Reess.|pg||
nt|daman: now     because she didn't play @Cs sooner     she will go down|pg||

nt|sharkey: think some miscommunication here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this may be awkward if South continues with a small spade  |pg||
nt|cuttysark: Assuming the ace asks for attitude, maybe North should encourage because she does not want a switch|pg||
pc|c8|nt|cuttysark: I guess South shows a maximum pass with diamonds and clubs|pg||

nt|h_karluk: thanks to our operator, kibbers and fellow commentators|pg||
nt|daman: not true     East doubled in the CR|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: The fact that you have 15 points opposite a 2@C opner usually means a grand but to their credit NS made it really hard in the CR--in the open room East could hace used RKCB |pg||
nt|h_karluk: http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php|pg||
nt|daman: they had a different auction though|pg||
nt|daman: N bid 2@C   over 1NT   ( gazilli of sorts ?)|pg||
mb|1C|nt|cuttysark: Still, 5 more sets to play, so far from over yet|pg||
mb|1H|nt|cuttysark: Last board of this set now, so  take the opportunity to thank Quentin, our fantastic operator|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|vugraphzxs: thx|pg||
nt|vugraphzxs: we will start at 5pm|pg||
nt|daman: and then NS ran to 4@S   which was doubled also|pg||
mb|2S|nt|daman: Reess stands to gain a lot on 19|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ady: e/w   likely to play 4@H|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  3@s must be asking bid - for partner's singleton|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 3@H looks rather pushy to me: they play quite sound single raises|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: presumebaly that shows 5-5 |pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: a minimum of 11|pg||
pc|h5|nt|daman: and this is now the last board of this session|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pc|h8|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Players use the jump in the 4th suit in different ways, but this pair play it a natural|pg||
nt|garnetts: Srry guys I have to go --as always it has been a pleasure to share the commentary with Liz and David--some interesting hands.  Bye for now|pg||
nt|ady: thx David|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Bye David - and thank you|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 2C kind of cbs/nmf, 2H max with 3cm support|pg||
nt|daman: here is the link for future sessions    http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jcwla: The temporizing 2@C will leave S glad not to be on opening lead.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: The great debate - to open 1NT with a 5card major or open the major, the never be able to show the right strength?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: They have 25 HCP, but not many tricks|pg||
nt|mdgraham: quiet board to end|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Still, they reached the normal game|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Thanks Liz, Sveta|pg||
pc|h3|nt|jcwla: Yeah, here E has really shown maybe a touch more than this to me; meanwhile, W glad to have been given a reprieve over 2@S to get to game.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Many would feel more comfortable about opening 1NT as E here by virtue of also holding three @H's.|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  so you, Mike|pg||
pc|d3|nt|cuttysark: Mind you, that would still get them to 3NT|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|jcwla: The idea is that with 2-5 in the majors, pd will get them to 2@H rather than 2@S.|pg||
pc|h9|nt|h_karluk: N was very close to 1N|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but he had 14|pg||
nt|h_karluk: cK not favorably placed, so far no endplay |pg||
nt|cuttysark: Match still tight, 2 segments to go, lots of excitement to come|pg||
pc|hT|pc|sK|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dA|pc|d7|nt|ady: Levey got another 4 imps on hand 17   made 1NT   which was down 1 here|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Interesting - Levy gains 4 more imps on board 17 by playing a low club from dummy at trick one - West played the queen from Qx and 1NT now became easy|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|daman: many thanks to our operator Quentin Levoy for a great job|pg||
pc|c2|nt|cuttysark: Declarer still hoping for tricks from spades - about to be disappointed|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  as last 4 boards dont' look as big swings, we should expect action in the 2 last segments|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cK|nt|cuttysark: This has become quite tricky now|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|h_karluk: only @h Q favorably placed, so a H, a D, and 2C obvious losers|pg||
nt|daman: and thanks to Ralf   Vladimir   and Mike for their observations and analysis|pg||
pc|c3|nt|jcwla: "What I done, Lord?  I been good." - Irene Reilly in "Confederancy of Dunces"|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Let us console ourselves with the knowledge that they will be struggling in the same contract in the other room|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cJ|pc|c4|pg||
pc|cA|pc|s9|pc|sT|pc|c9|pg||
nt|cuttysark: The winning line is to draw trump, cross to a spade and concede a club to the king|pg||
