nt|Walddk2: Hamar is located on the shores of lake MjÃ¸sa, Norway's largest lake, and is the principal city of Hedmark county. Vikingskipet (the Viking Ship) became world famous for hosting the ...|pg||

pc|dT|pc|d7|pc|d2|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|h_karluk: too many rules, 15, 19, 20 imho experts good at that|pg||
nt|baardolav: Simonsen have to get rid of the D ace now... to avoid endplay|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d8|pc|dQ|pc|d3|pg||

mb|2D|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: speaking of my own "Time to think about their alternatives are clear or not" |pg||
nt|baardolav: 6spade is on here for EW|pg||
nt|h_karluk: a very light opening at 1st seat|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not a great slam and certainly not if played by East|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i guess pass pass and 2@c or 2N (depends their CC) would better|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: What's wrong with a weak 2, Hamdi?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You are NV against V|pg||
nt|chick: how can W find out what he needs to know for a slam?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 1st seat, i do not like to deceive my nonpassed partner|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: If opener is allowed to bid his suit, you have lost the advantage of opening a Multi 2@D|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i may not find 21 at all times|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|pc|h6|pc|h8|pg||

nt|h_karluk: i only see a spade tenace there, side suits bleak|pg||
mc|12|nt|h_karluk: however my review, my opinion|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@C maximum unspecified major (3@D asks which and you bid the major you don't have). 3@D weak with hearts, 3@H weak with spades|pg||
nt|sybarra: most use 3 @C/3@d to show hts and sp max (I thought) |pg||
nt|sybarra: that is more interesting Roland |pg||
pg||

nt|sybarra: yes I can see |pg||
nt|baardolav: I use that setup, and then you also can show AKQxxx too|pg||
nt|baardolav: in both suits before 3nt|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: i forgot, long years passed, i think we were playing multi including 4441 good, so 3 level bids over 2N were really impressive|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|baardolav: 4441 is not common any more|pg||
pc|h4|nt|h_karluk: sure, in the states i didn't see any multi fan here (district 7)|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h8|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|chick: that's because the ACBL (in its infinite wisdom) has made multi a restricted convention|pg||
nt|sybarra: in the states, Hamdi,  multi is not permitted |pg||
pc|sK|nt|baardolav: to open in multi :)|pg||

nt|Walddk2: You'll get 8 years in the district jail in Raleigh if you try to open a Multi|pg||
nt|baardolav: strange lead... try to find partner when he have all the HCP missing|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|pc|sT|pc|s8|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cT|pc|cK|pc|c7|pg||
nt|santyclz: Multi is considered a "gateway" convention, leading to things like "forcing pass."|pg||
mc|10|nt|h_karluk: however, i think 2@d Multi allowed in higher level, i m qualified for GNT, after Morgentown (sorry if misspelled) who knows|pg||

nt|baardolav: 2nt makes with a natural h lead... 3 goes down... for sure... a lot down... because he have to make the spadefiness early|pg||

nt|h_karluk: <double dummy> underleading from @d A even 2N would put declarer into enough pressure, that's why i said "This can make 2N but it can also go down"|pg||

nt|h_karluk: that's cool|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c5|pc|c9|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's a lucky 3NT. 6 tricks in the minors and two aces. Then you can endplay East to give you an extra trick in a major|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|pc|cJ|pc|c3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: However, you could easily go down by taking a double finesse in hearts|pg||
