nt|chick: 3N unspecified splinter?|pg||
nt|szalay: hi all|pg||
nt|sybarra: S  was our operator in last match |pg||
nt|yuval10: W is Giampietro, Cristina|pg||
nt|daman: would we double with the South hand?|pg||
nt|haans: double?|pg||
nt|daman: or would we bid 2@C?    2@H?|pg||
nt|daman: pass is not an option|pg||
nt|haans: diamond will win|pg||
nt|chick: 2@H would be my choice|pg||
nt|haans: 2+ is alertable|pg||
nt|daman: it really doesn't matter because West will always compete in @Ds|pg||
nt|sybarra: gm Simon :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: Hello Simon|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hello everyone from Manchester|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Hey y'all , welcome to White House Juniors - Round Robin 15 of 23|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hello hamdi|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: overbidding|pg||
nt|daman: 2@D must be a transfer|pg||
nt|chick: transfer advances?|pg||
nt|haans: if they make 1ntx they get 180|pg||
nt|daman: oui|pg||
nt|haans: :) Hi and Welcome :)|pg||
nt|haans: not all open clubs here|pg||
nt|haans: good passing|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: there are chances for going overboard, funny hand first up|pg||
nt|szalay: hi all|pg||
nt|ady: n/s may get to game in no-trumps    likely to go down|pg||
nt|haans: yep |pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/index.php?option=com_frontpage&Itemid=76|pg||
nt|szalay: I suppose 2@H was both majors|pg||
nt|sybarra: you can find list of participants, and standings on that site|pg||
nt|szalay: btw its a bit strange North didnt open|pg||
nt|szalay: probably 4@D SPL is the best bid by West|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ady: will e/e  steal the contract    n/s can make a lucky 3NT  and make and make a safer contract in diamonds  10 tricks|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hello Kath from South Carolina, Columbia|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i was just looking at the list of countries playing  but what is the World Team?|pg||
pc|hT|nt|szalay: Israel play stad Israeli, I believe: strong NT, 5 card major, etc.|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: EW play natural, I think|pg||
nt|frankaus: not me  - 4 @S  would tempt me|pg||
nt|frankaus: then i'm a senior|pg||
nt|szalay: match starts with a boring 3N|pg||
nt|haans: doomed|pg||
nt|sybarra: and S has no further interest |pg||
nt|szalay: I dont suggest spl with 3 trumps only|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh, sorry,  S is brother of operator of last match |pg||
nt|chick: nor do I|pg||
nt|chick: E will leave that with his heart holding|pg||
nt|daman: West will balance|pg||
nt|haans: Hi Simon|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|VugraphPl1: http://michzimny.pl/bridge/2010/pila/gp.html|pg||
nt|ady: e/w can make 3NT    but hardly bidable|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=80&Itemid=72  for participants |pg||
nt|rnmalik: EW have 9 tricks as the cards are placed, agree.|pg||
nt|szalay: ok, u can drink coffee, he will make it|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I suggest - but do not support|pg||
nt|chick: many people like to play 1@S 4@H as natural hearts, so 3N gives a way to make a heart splinter|pg||
nt|chick: but in this hand, I would just bid a 2/1 2@D (or other game force)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  So would we all, I think|pg||
nt|haans: diamond will win|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|ady: 2@H open room so will be a push|pg||
nt|hawe45:  2 NT checking for slam ambitions|pg||
nt|chick: imho, S is not strong enough for 2N|pg||
nt|haans: no stop there|pg||
nt|yuval10: T@s looks like the natural lead|pg||
nt|haans: many nowday bid 2nt invite or better|pg||
nt|yuval10: link for results : http://www.nbbportal.nl/1003/|pg||
nt|yuval10: click on "competitie"|pg||
nt|chick: W already neglected to bid @Ds, would be surprised to see him come in at the 3 level|pg||
pc|h4|nt|sybarra: do we have running scores Jacco?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: last time i saw Owen in Tri City (West Columbia) sectional, he is 21 y.o., educating in Economics branch in NC State College|pg||
nt|haans: clubs lead?|pg||
nt|haans: best|pg||
nt|ady: even on the lead will go down on a heart switch|pg||
nt|daman: uh oh|pg||
nt|haans: that double is new|pg||
pc|h8|nt|xenya: well EW can make 6@D|pg||
nt|szalay: but if u have singleton, better to show it yourself|pg||
nt|daman: it was OK for him to pass 2@D    he was going to get anpther chance to bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: EW lead 2/4|pg||
pc|h3|nt|szalay: after given bidding best trump play (double hook) is even better|pg||
nt|xenya: hello again|pg||
nt|haans: opening 1@C was suicide here|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe should have ducked that one |pg||
nt|haans: did not like @C switch|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: he was afraid for @C's wasnt he?|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|szalay: ok, u can try 6@D, but its terrible...long run I dont suggest slams with 30 hcp and 2 balanced hands|pg||
nt|szalay: bid your games, take your tricks (by Hamman) is good advice in any level|pg||
nt|sybarra: I take it this is the "slam try" sequence |pg||
nt|szalay: with aceless 11, with Qx @C I wd just say 3N, confess|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: I think east made a slamtry here, that is what i heard from the explanation from west|pg||
nt|szalay: a bit starnge 3@C rebid except its forcing (doubt it) with 9 top tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: nope it works now|pg||
nt|hawe45:  East and West doÂ´nt play the same system here|pg||
nt|haans: not in agrement here|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i would RD there onstead of 2@d, 2ndly i would definitely start with 1@h|pg||
nt|haans: 2@D show support|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|ady: west should know on the 2 lead that north has 5 clubs|pg||
nt|haans: whappen happened her|pg||
nt|frankaus: 15 2 H in pd major - pd opens - how many will stay short of game?|pg||
nt|haans: non vul yes |pg||
nt|haans: you need 50% to bid game|pg||
nt|h_karluk: my sys card is 2/1 - so it's impossible to stop before game with EW hands|pg||
nt|szalay: and ART asking bid w/o shortness|pg||
nt|daman: the axe might be unsheathed again|pg||
nt|daman: but maybe not|pg||
nt|daman: 3@C was very risky given North only promises 2|pg||
nt|chick: true, but ... he is better getting in his one bid at the first chance and then stay very quiet|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: So the names will be up soon again|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ah i see|pg||
pc|dA|nt|szalay: if it was slamtry, West wd accept for sure|pg||
nt|h_karluk: he and his mother Miss Anita are BBO players|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Yuval Yener|pg||
nt|yuval10: hi all|pg||
nt|haans: mirrow hands not thye best|pg||
nt|h_karluk: unfortunately i've no idea , maybe just a show match, saw in Venice Olympiads long years ago|pg||
pc|d3|nt|frankaus: i can handle the language of a child in hungarian but no idea about bridge terminology|pg||
nt|sybarra: this match is  2 Francy v   3 Neth. Blue|pg||
nt|hawe45:  He had seen his cards...(North)|pg||
nt|haans: diamond will win|pg||
pc|d6|nt|sharkey: sry - crashed|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Also welcome to Adam Kaplan|pg||
nt|haans: easy 1nt in my book (as opener)|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: Hi all :)|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Adam|pg||
nt|haans: hi adam still only 14?|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: *still*, yes :)|pg||
nt|haans: well cure for that|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and then RD?|pg||
nt|haans: same distribution|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like 2 off|pg||
pc|d2|nt|haans: :(|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|szalay: we will see trump play|pg||
nt|Walddk4: West is Giampetro|pg||
nt|daman: down 2 |pg||
nt|haans: 2 down|pg||
nt|copeyj: Many people after (1@C)-X-(1M) play X as showing 4 and bid 2M with 5, but obviously not Bessis/Volcker|pg||
pc|dK|nt|sybarra: costs nothing to put up the q |pg||
nt|szalay: as u probably know: u must leas Q first|pg||
nt|yuval10: Operator can you please insert W's name?  |pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|haans: flat board|pg||
nt|ady: cash to clubs puts pressure on west   has to discard a heart   but still down 1|pg||
nt|haans: are they playing Magic Diamond?|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: seems like a crossruff will come to 11 tricks fairly easily|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|szalay: French pair won Bonn Open Teams (Nations Cup) last year|pg||
nt|haans: lucky bidding :)|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ady: would expect 130 to be flat    but you never know|pg||
nt|haans: many play x as take out|pg||
pc|d7|nt|szalay: personally I wd open West as 2N, if it starts at 20...7 controls, 4 tricks|pg||
nt|haans: i would sday just cards|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ahh there were also one in Lille 98 France|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||

nt|yo_yo: ah thanks to spec:  the world champions from istanbul|pg||
nt|po-s: really? from two different countries?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: unfortunately i was abroad from home country|pg||

nt|sybarra: you had another website for us |pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: I dont see them yet. Red vs Blue was 22-8|pg||
nt|h_karluk: we hope that's real per olaf|pg||
nt|yo_yo: japan and the czech republic, seems an odd combination   :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i guess they've enough trophies in such events|pg||
pc|h7|nt|szalay: cause u can gain JTxx in South, but not in North|pg||
nt|szalay: lead|pg||
nt|daman: by passng and then doubling West was able to show his shape|pg||
nt|daman: which is helpful|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ady: force dummy with heart now|pg||
nt|ady: othjerwise 11 tricks|pg||
pc|s9|nt|frankaus: if !K off side even 9 may be hard to come by|pg||
nt|h_karluk: some pairs play support doubles and redoubles, a matter of style|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Good tecnique - South might have all 4 trumps|pg||
nt|daman: he should have 9 cards in the pointeds|pg||
nt|haans: ruffing clubs|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: cash 2@s, 2@c and A@D ending in hand, and crossruff away|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|haans: Magic Diamond 1@S 8-12 hcp|pg||

pc|s5|pg||
nt|yuval10: i'm not so sure about this hand being a flat....quite possible for NS to stay away of game here|pg||

nt|szalay: I think 1@C is not an option|pg||
nt|sybarra: and stiff A of @C makes the hand easy|pg||
nt|szalay: either 2N or (semi)forcing 2@C/@D|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Ducking @C Queen seems better|pg||
nt|xenya: It says Round 12 here, but this is Round 10?|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: round 10, yes.|pg||
nt|xenya: OK|pg||
nt|po-s: strange discards|pg||
nt|mcphee: hi PO|pg||
nt|po-s: hi Bob|pg||
nt|mcphee: i did not particularly like the 1N response last hand|pg||
mb|1H|nt|szalay: what wd u bid over 1@C-1x-?|pg||
nt|pelu: hi all|pg||
nt|szalay: funny board|pg||
nt|haans: card to 3@S?|pg||
nt|chick: 3@S for me|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, just stuck to his original plan|pg||
nt|copeyj: yes|pg||
nt|haans: only Nab if an ms|pg||
nt|copeyj: south is Frederic Volcker|pg||
nt|haans: is an ms|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: Ms Ormay opening|pg||
nt|copeyj: I wonder what Nab will open|pg||
nt|Walddk4: As long as she is not amiss|pg||
nt|copeyj: I am sure some people would choose 1NT especially 3rd seat nv|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 23-17 and we'll see what comes from the hat|pg||
mb|2H|nt|szalay: if u go to normal games: go as fast as u can...dont give them chance to interfere|pg||
nt|sybarra: probably a preemptive @D raise coming |pg||
nt|szalay: why not 4@H with passed pd?|pg||
nt|frankaus: Ax no the best stopper in the world often better played from Qx side|pg||
nt|szalay: slam is unlikely, @H are good, so?|pg||
nt|sybarra: but unlikely to keep e/w out of 4 @H |pg||
nt|sybarra: you had the one with the picture |pg||
nt|sharkey: appears 4@S can be made - however, may have transportation problems|pg||
nt|ady: part score hand    n/s may be able to stop in 2@D|pg||
nt|chick: with all their controls, can EW stay out of the @D slam?|pg||
nt|szalay: good 4@Hs fails, worse 3N COULD be make (for @H lead)|pg||
nt|xenya: i would be content with just 1@S|pg||
nt|haans: ms|pg||
nt|copeyj: there we go|pg||
nt|copeyj: Some pairs play X of a strong NT as artificial, including myself. But when the opps have opened 1N 3rd seat nv I play penalty doubles|pg||
nt|copeyj: Would be useful here to have a penalty double available|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: the website|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like 12 tricks for me....previous hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Peter |pg||
nt|szalay: it was 11-14 NT|pg||
nt|daman: another partscore?   EW have the potential for a lot of tricks in @Cs|pg||
nt|po-s: depends how mny diamonds 1D showed. Nowadays......|pg||
mb|2N|nt|frankaus: looks like a 30 point deck to E |pg||
nt|h_karluk: so far EW 5@c-1 and NS 4@s -1|pg||
nt|szalay: pass with 4 hcp (including a King) very dangerous|pg||
nt|ady: even 2NT opening did not get them to game|pg||
nt|sybarra: can S venture a bid,  yes he does|pg||
nt|sybarra: n/s may push them a bit here|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I only bid 2 @H here with a @h-suit...|pg||
nt|chick: you think S's suit is too weak?|pg||
nt|yuval10: i would've pass from E, to be honest|pg||
nt|haans: nothing perfect|pg||
nt|daman: and can make 8 tricks in NT|pg||
nt|sybarra: can xx and land in clubs |pg||
nt|mcphee: E might try for game here|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 4H looks OK but not enough points to bid it probably|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: then we understand|pg||
nt|po-s: In France I bet they have penalty doubles|pg||
mb|4H|nt|sybarra: and E with 4333....|pg||
nt|szalay: wd u bid 5@D over 1@D-4@H-?|pg||
nt|sybarra: this may go 2 @H all pass |pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: yes but that is a blog|pg||
nt|ady: n/s likely to play 2@H|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i would even not try it|pg||
nt|sharkey: Standings after 2 rounds: http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=85&Itemid=79|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: after 3 rounds actuallly|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but i would rebid 1N as West|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 3@c wouldn't be much fun to play|pg||
nt|copeyj: Double is probably artificial it has been alerted|pg||
nt|copeyj: Bessis will be pleasantly surprised by his partner's choice of suit|pg||
nt|copeyj: note E/W can get out for 300 in 5@CX|pg||
nt|copeyj: and even 6@CX is a profitable save against 11 tricks in @S|pg||
nt|mcphee: to coind a phrase, points smoints|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Kopecky is bidding up¬|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: interesting 1NT|pg||
nt|szalay: in junior/female tourney I think to play weak nt 2/1 is an advantage|pg||
nt|haans: and a make :)|pg||
nt|haans: and then ...|pg||
nt|haans: good pass by south|pg||
nt|Walddk4: If LC had been here, he would call 3@S an anti-Law bid|pg||
nt|haans: 1st time ive seen walsh trf here|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: 4@s is some bid by N, P has a very good support though|pg||
nt|yuval10: and now probably bid 5@s ?|pg||
nt|sharkey: Gembick's pass??|pg||
nt|haans: 1n bye North?|pg||
nt|haans: nopåe|pg||
nt|haans: not a nice bid when vul|pg||
nt|sharkey: They've landed in their best strain|pg||
nt|ady: north 2@D rebid very respectable|pg||
nt|sybarra: dout you get killed at the 2 level,  I would bid  ...sort of only chance|pg||
nt|sybarra: *doubt |pg||
nt|chick: should make this|pg||
nt|haans: dirty hand for 4@S but best choice|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: ir 2 @C all pass |pg||
nt|haans: 2@D must be 6-carder|pg||
nt|ady: unfortunately may well go down |pg||
nt|pelu: I would open 2NT (20-21) - over 1@C - 1X I bid 3MT = 15-18 with long @C|pg||
nt|daman: 5@C was aggressive|pg||
nt|mcphee: attack or passive lead?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: personally i didn't get 2NT rebid, OK 15 there however 5431, maybe a good reason to start with F---y convention, but it seems not in their CC|pg||
nt|yo_yo: gosh a working 13 opposite a balanced 8 count|pg||
pc|c3|nt|szalay: why not double by South?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 2254 and 15|pg||
nt|hawe45:  By several levels too weak - and only @C-lead defeats 6 @D|pg||
nt|szalay: its not true Open highest level|pg||
nt|yuval10: i think it's makeable in any way, via @c finesse|pg||
nt|haans: if opps do not play @H raise @D|pg||
nt|mcphee: this may fail|pg||
nt|yo_yo: what's  that convention?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and i think 1M>2M in their book is 8-10 max, if that's true i wld gladly offer 2@s rebid|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: 2nt was shortness in @c they say|pg||
nt|mcphee: declarer needs to do a lot of work|pg||
nt|mcphee: looks like 1 down to me|pg||
nt|yo_yo: isnt it 3 losers?|pg||
nt|mcphee: i doubt they will allow a dummy entry after this lead|pg||
nt|mcphee: low @D fro hand to the 8 or 9 only way to make now|pg||
nt|h_karluk: srry for my wrong input abt E's holding, 4531 is correct|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ady: best spot for n/s is clubs  but unable to get there|pg||
nt|sybarra: a @h lead might not be so pleasant |pg||
nt|ady: may well be a swing for Netherlands|pg||
nt|szalay: in 4N|pg||
nt|haans: and clubs honors right|pg||
nt|sybarra: works on this hand |pg||
nt|sybarra: (maybe)|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: if you play strong 1N i|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: you probably will play there|pg||
nt|mcphee: lose 2@S 1@D 1@H|pg||
pc|c8|nt|frankaus: traffic light is red pays to be conservative|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh well what do I know |pg||
nt|haans: 4@H young bidding|pg||
nt|h_karluk: this time black Kings are not favorably placed|pg||
nt|daman: opposite a passed hand|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|szalay: e-w gave them all the chance|pg||
nt|xenya: they might get to a hopeless slam now -- and they did|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 @S?  rkk ? |pg||
nt|szalay: u can beat 5@C if u play some special (lavinthal, roman) signal over A of @S|pg||
nt|haans: E dont fool me|pg||
nt|szalay: some specs asked why|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 5@D is makeable, this contract looks unlucky|pg||
nt|szalay: I think cause at Open this kinda toy isnt so dangerous|pg||
nt|szalay: in junior/female tourney 80% or more of the field unfamiliar with weak NT sys|pg||
nt|szalay: I think no pair in the World who wd play 5-3 minor-suit game instead of 5-3 major|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true |pg||
nt|daman: who simply raised|pg||
nt|haans: they have clubs you have points so play clubs|pg||
nt|mcphee: running the @C however will help|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that's a brave duck|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|szalay: I think first step to trap was 1@H...after that they came deeper and deeper|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: seemed like a cuebid auction to me|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/index.php?option=com_frontpage&Itemid=76|pg||
nt|sybarra: this site has a picture of the beautiful facility at the White House |pg||
nt|yuval10: will make 11 now|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sybarra: it is a reburbished tennis club,  (still active tennis courts)  and a wonder bridge facility |pg||
nt|chick: no club finesse necessary |pg||
nt|haans: but bid but|pg||
nt|haans: big|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ady: yes agree should be 6 card suit  but AQ to 6 and 2 outside aces is top weight|pg||
nt|daman: I don't think there are 11 tricks|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|szalay: or by accident, only|pg||
nt|chick: :)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|sybarra: and they are playing with screens |pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/index.php?option=com_content&task=blogcategory&id=31&Itemid=78   standing after round 1|pg||
nt|sybarra: long way to go |pg||
nt|frankaus: can get it home on this lead|pg||
nt|h_karluk: honestly i would bid 4@d as West|pg||
nt|yuval10: the lead was one more good reason for not opening 1@h with such a poor suit |pg||
nt|haans: if only 1@S overcall is not game harder to find?|pg||
nt|xenya: i agree|pg||
nt|xenya: nice lead -- tough for declarer now as entries to dummy are scarce|pg||
pc|h8|nt|rnmalik: @D back|pg||
nt|ady: defence should prevail |pg||
pc|h4|pc|hA|pg||
nt|haans: better late than never|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 3@s is definitely an agressive bid... I am not a fan|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ady: spade lay out bad for declarer|pg||
nt|haans: @H" = hearts 4-4|pg||
nt|mcphee: but actually declarer still had same problem even winning @CQ|pg||
nt|mcphee: now it is making|pg||
pc|s7|nt|rnmalik: the bidding sequence enabled EW to find the defence to 2@H|pg||
nt|haans: clubs ruff?|pg||
nt|frankaus: not easy to switch to 1S|pg||
nt|frankaus: @S|pg||
nt|xenya: i meant about the 1@H opening|pg||
nt|haans: 2|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|szalay: 2@D was NOT xfer, was gameforcing stayman|pg||
nt|szalay: 3@D had shown a normal 6card or very good 5card suit|pg||
nt|mcphee: 2 table entries for sure|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ady: cant see any other bidding possible|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am not so sure why N bid over 2 @C |pg||
nt|sybarra: where was he going?|pg||
nt|ady: this might be down 3|pg||
nt|ady: 9 tricks on any lead|pg||
nt|haans: very few have methods for a prempts after 1nt opening|pg||
pc|s4|nt|frankaus: WD|pg||
nt|h_karluk: also not hard with @s T9 etc|pg||
nt|szalay: I confess I wd bid 3N directly over that|pg||
nt|copeyj: ah sorry 5@CX is 500|pg||
nt|copeyj: thanks kibs :)|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|haans: best defense|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|animeshraj: a low h now!  and h q frm west|pg||
nt|yuval10: 9@d will enable declarer to avoid @d loser|pg||
nt|Walddk4: All results (including butlers and hand records) on www.nbbportal.nl/1003/ > 'competitie'|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sybarra: oh well |pg||
pc|c9|pc|cT|nt|szalay: and my fate is in West's hand|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @d9 was indeed a slip in defense - either @hJ or small @c would work better|pg||
nt|szalay: always tough to decide between strong 4card or weaker 5card suit to lead vs. 3N|pg||
nt|yo_yo: well i take my hat off to them, bidding and making that game|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d6|pc|d5|nt|xenya: if E has @CA and a spade honour, slam is quite good -- perhaps too much to ask for? |pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: declarer claims @D7, but some debate whether it counts when @D is trump suit :)|pg||
nt|daman: down 1|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|h6|nt|haans: ruff|pg||
nt|mcphee: proving it is wise to bid those close vul games|pg||
pc|c6|nt|h_karluk: well i didn't get it, sorry, why i am supposed to play 5/2 @s fit? maybe there's still a 5/4 @d fit, so i liked 1NT rebid - just keeps bidding open, i don't think promises a rose ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: garden :)|pg||
nt|pelu: Decl: better play @D first - the @h-suit was locked for defense|pg||
nt|haans: endplay small @D to decl|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hT|pg||
nt|ady: sorry did not see 2@C bid   but was presumably a transfer to 2@D |pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/index.php?option=com_content&task=blogcategory&id=31&Itemid=78|pg||

nt|mcphee: land in 2 or a major is my guess here|pg||

mb|2C!|nt|sybarra: http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/index.php?option=com_frontpage&Itemid=76  actually think this one is easier using left hand index |pg||
nt|haans: that overcall vul is WEAK|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: I think a tipical mistake to correct in junior age by coach(es): stop slam-greedy|pg||
nt|sybarra: they keep skipping the @S suit, but it is 4333   |pg||
nt|szalay: the imp score is done for GAMES, from both directions|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 21/19 and North lonely cowboy now|pg||
nt|pelu: for me 1NT or 2Nt!|pg||
nt|haans: agree|pg||
nt|ady: would have tht 1NT better from north|pg||
nt|haans: 2@C not forcing|pg||
nt|szalay: that is the reason why in Hungary we tend NOT to lead 4card suit vs. 3N, rather "odd card major"|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: we'll see how low everyone can stay on this board... 3@c and 2M look to be the limits|pg||
nt|haans: that michaes not my cup|pg||
nt|xenya: N got somewhat greedy when he played a small diamond, allowing contract to make, in theory, and that resulted in 2 down  |pg||

nt|marlowepi: something like an 18% contract, but you just end up there after the normal opening by N|pg||
nt|h_karluk: seems declarer agreed with me|pg||
nt|yo_yo: stayman surely, not smolen|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: 2@c now cbs- i suppose|pg||
nt|sharkey: NS past their comfort zone |pg||

nt|sybarra: Jacco's may be better |pg||
nt|sybarra: mine is participants I see |pg||
nt|szalay: in my book 3@D is NOT forcing, so dunno why West bid on|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Nort has just 5 losers, however no entry to table|pg||
nt|ady: get clubposition will  make life easy|pg||
nt|sybarra: website,  on left you can go to participants, scores etc  |pg||
nt|chick: 2N = unusual (minors in this case), but sacrificing VUL is usually dangerous, and E doesn't have enough for 4@C imo|pg||
nt|chick: and W is sucked in by E's bid to a very risky save|pg||
nt|hawe45:  West is socked in by his own 2 NT-bid - lacking 2-3 key-cards vulnerable|pg||
nt|hawe45:  sucked|pg||
nt|haans: @C) good|pg||
nt|haans: 9|pg||
nt|daman: what is their carding?|pg||
nt|haans: making it easy|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 3N is also making I suppose|pg||
nt|haans: nice|pg||
nt|xenya: it does -- on a @D finesse|pg||
mb|2S|nt|szalay: e-w has their 3rd dangerous bidding so far|pg||
nt|haans: i play 3@C as a prempt|pg||
nt|haans: many beginners believe all new suit bids are forcing even when reponers first say = have weak hand|pg||
nt|ady: diamond back best for now|pg||
nt|haans: standard for 2nt bid to be forcing nowdays|pg||
nt|daman: a spec says udca|pg||
nt|mcphee: N usually bidding 2@S now|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: put me down as a pass with Wests hand - aceless 4333 even with 14 i would pass|pg||
nt|szalay: double by South?|pg||
nt|ady: 2 spades and a club it seems|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i play as jump rebid|pg||
nt|haans: clubsa clubs and more clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: and maybe that was a good reason to begin with a convention - the F******y|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Even green against red it is doubtful|pg||
nt|haans: some very young some not more than 25|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: welcoms Szalay |pg||
nt|ady: needs to cash club now|pg||
nt|szalay: normal bidding, normal contract, easy make|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 2@h also works - natural|pg||
nt|yuval10: with some overtricks|pg||
nt|pelu: Howard 8Australia) after same start bid 1Nt in N|pg||
nt|szalay: Brigitta became a bit pessimistic abroad|pg||
nt|szalay: so here @S lead for us...the best one|pg||
nt|szalay: @D fulfills it|pg||
nt|szalay: as bridgeplayer I wd like to watch @S lerad...as Hungarian @D:)|pg||
nt|szalay: lead|pg||
nt|daman: that was not a great switch|pg||
nt|haans: @C) = lavinthal|pg||
nt|haans: 9|pg||
nt|po-s: A bit lucky - to find South with the two minor queens|pg||
nt|haans: @h neutral so best|pg||
nt|po-s: if garbage stayman, 44 is enough|pg||
nt|yo_yo: so the Aussies now in action|pg||
nt|yo_yo: are they brothers?  brother and sister?|pg||
pc|s6|nt|sybarra: Jacco's first web site, you can see the beautiful facility |pg||
nt|szalay: he has 2 aces, pd had shown values, they bypassed 3n...SO|pg||
nt|rnmalik: good lead|pg||
nt|szalay: odd card major, u know:)|pg||
nt|szalay: but are few exceptions what I dont tell u know...we need some secret weapons:)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: so is @H in E:)|pg||
nt|szalay: unbid oddcard major, to be specific|pg||
nt|rnmalik: ok|pg||
nt|yuval10: red suit lead will give declarer his 9th trick, not that he can't develope one in @s anyway...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: interestingly, in 3N you want the club king onside, but in 5D you want the opening leader to have it:)|pg||
nt|mcphee: yes just try to get out of the crummy NT spot|pg||
nt|yo_yo: twins?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: brothers,  thanks|pg||
nt|yo_yo: in fact how many females are in this competition?|pg||
nt|mcphee: good lead this trump|pg||
nt|yo_yo: maybe the operator can tell us?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: opps have 6 cards in @h/@s suit, as expected 4-2  48%, so 2@s good choice while they had 5/2?|pg||
nt|po-s: it is called girls, not females|pg||
nt|mcphee: the point is they do not know for sure if @H is 5-2|pg||
nt|h_karluk: juniors|pg||
nt|po-s: Or possibly women|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think after 2@c it's guaranteed 5/4 weak|pg||
nt|yo_yo: most women arent offended by being called female, PO|pg||
nt|mcphee: using stayman in this fashion declarer may hold 5@S and 4@H even and a weak hand|pg||
nt|yo_yo: and girls , to my mind , grow to be women about the age of 18|pg||
nt|mcphee: as many treat 2@S in that sequence as invitational values|pg||
nt|mcphee: containng both majors|pg||
nt|h_karluk: okay, however when our Ladies team won we say wd girlz, and they say ty boyz :)|pg||
nt|mcphee: the only good thing about this hand is he is not down yet|pg||
pc|s3|nt|haans: with 4-2 draw trumfs and play nt|pg||
nt|chick: as a kib points out, E may want to double 4@S as well|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: quite the aggresive type of lady..|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: well, takes a @h lead to make 3N on the @d finesse|pg||
pc|s9|nt|vugraphzeg: I made the classic mistake 4 and A|pg||
nt|szalay: hi all|pg||
nt|ady: hi|pg||
nt|sybarra: has to be careful now not to lose a @S |pg||
nt|rnmalik: hi and welcome|pg||
nt|haans: have x for mopre cards|pg||
nt|pelu: nu lead can defeat 3Nt - 3!X then u set up 3 @D-tricks = 9|pg||
nt|ady: with hearts 4-4  heart lead would not beat the contract  defence take 3 hearts and 1 diamond|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Facing a vulnerable 2 NT, East can only see 3 losers|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|h_karluk: depends agreements just use 2@d or 2@h, and make things easier|pg||
nt|szalay: btw @H beats it as well|pg||
nt|rnmalik: It makes only on @D lead|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I mean as the cards are|pg||
nt|szalay: Hope can lead @S back, cause sure partner has T: otherwise declarer wd play small from dummy, probably|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: Hop asking questions about possible distribution|pg||
nt|szalay: some spec suggested @C lead is ok as well: to be honest I dont lead opps suit from Txx...NEVER|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: of declarer's hand|pg||
nt|szalay: declerer could have 4card @S|pg||
nt|szalay: his bid just denies 4card @H|pg||
nt|haans: now can raise hearts|pg||
nt|haans: no sry|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i can see ;6 tricks|pg||
nt|mcphee: low @C?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|szalay: to bid games, take tricks...and double games when they r in vuln and we see the chance|pg||
nt|sybarra: it is a reburbished tennis club (still active tennis courts) and quite a terrific bridge facility also |pg||
nt|haans: many  mean 3n to show two cards in opening suit|pg||
nt|yuval10: now only @h will limit declarer to 10|pg||
nt|daman: tempo is everything|pg||
pc|s7|nt|h_karluk: 11-15 5@h+4@s stuff|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: made a mistake when correcting the first score|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: was 1 off|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: dummy is getting tapped, and this should be down one too many I believe|pg||
pc|s4|nt|yuval10: otherwise 12 tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like that, yes|pg||
nt|xenya: but this seems to give declarer a break|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|ady: this not definately making from south's point of view|pg||
nt|ady: if south plays K@H now then will be much better placed|pg||
nt|szalay: do u see any reason for small @D?|pg||
nt|szalay: except blocking suit?|pg||
nt|szalay: and to give fals impression to pd?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  West might refret the small @D - but we do not know their methods|pg||
nt|szalay: I am informed Hungarian defender started @S as well|pg||
nt|szalay: he learnt his lesson well, wd:)|pg||
nt|szalay: I believe to lead small from Qx is technically bad|pg||
nt|szalay: when dummy has 76xx|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I agree adds to confusion for the P|pg||
nt|szalay: small @D back wd be a punishment...|pg||
nt|szalay: but:|pg||
nt|szalay: who has J of @S?|pg||
nt|szalay: surely West|pg||
nt|szalay: otherwise declarer wd play small, not Q|pg||
nt|szalay: at trick 1|pg||
nt|szalay: so @S is a 100% lead|pg||
nt|haans: back to teaching|pg||
nt|mcphee: not an easy defence really is it|pg||
nt|mcphee: low @C to J not a bad plan |pg||
pc|dK|nt|h_karluk: everything is on the right spot for NS|pg||
nt|haans: we have all seen better defense|pg||
pc|d2|nt|szalay: I was there..in February..I remember was terrible cold and windy|pg||
nt|haans: say ty opps|pg||
nt|ady: but east can get 2 spade ruffs|pg||
nt|pelu: yes: @Sk - @s ruff - @c to A and @S ruff|pg||
nt|haans: to strong for flannery|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ady: K@S   spade ruff   then trump back and another spade ruff|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|daman: the @C 9  and @D 6 seem to be suit preference for @Ss :)|pg||
pc|c7|nt|h_karluk: i think Bobby Goldman described well what to do in his book Aces Scientific with 5/4 or 5/5 weak/strong M holdings|pg||
pc|c5|nt|h_karluk: maybe the software allows you to correct it anytime, i think Roland is good at that|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: could S maybe chuck the Q@C on the king?|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: needs partner to have all the intermediate clubs though|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|h_karluk: to me ideal F-----y|pg||
nt|sybarra: should be fairly certain now that spdes are 3/3|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|ady: now making 11|pg||
nt|rnmalik: as the cards we see +1 now|pg||
nt|h_karluk: because the hand does not contain reverse values|pg||
nt|chick: well, they may get out for down only 1|pg||
nt|po-s: this was a bad plan since now defenders won´t have a problem....shouldn´t|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d5|nt|ady: sorry  Peter you were first|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: Bas van Beijsterveldt helped me :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: congrats :)|pg||
nt|haans: Hi Erwin|pg||
nt|frankaus: will make 12 i expect|pg||
nt|haans: decl do not know how to play @H|pg||
nt|po-s: North should have a pretty good club suit after his spade bid|pg||
nt|xenya: yes -- and N gets another chance|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|vugraphzeg: claimed too early|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: quite messy at the table |pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d9|nt|pelu: normal u dont give distribution i trumf, but here it would help W if he know that pd has even No|pg||
pc|cT|pc|d4|pg||
pc|h5|nt|sybarra: easy now |pg||
nt|hawe45:  West should know, that when declarer plays @S Queen from dummy, East PROBABLY has the 10!|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mcphee: @H now is a killer|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h6|pg||
pc|sA|nt|h_karluk: enters to table with a @c - pitches 2 @h loser, that's al folks|pg||
pc|s5|nt|szalay: Israel is slow starter: they missed a so-so slam after agressive slamtry, bid a (nearly) hopeless one...and bid terrible game, where only good news it wasnt double|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: http://www.vkblog.nl/blog/3052/Bridgenieuws some impressions from the pro am yesterday. Esp interesting for the dutch viewers|pg||
nt|szalay: d|pg||

nt|h_karluk: esp when u r a passed hand|pg||
nt|yuval10: indeed, 2@c is invitational |pg||
nt|h_karluk: i agree with 3@c rebid, invite or better, i can live with that 5 losers, no matter entry to table, i know no need to cry when they sets, favorable vuln was another tempting factor|pg||

nt|haans: not bad|pg||

nt|szalay: rehi|pg||
nt|ady: west may open some sort of weak 2|pg||
nt|daman: they should gain at least 3 IMPs    800 was there for the taking|pg||
nt|haans: @C9 acceptable of play low enc|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: so George, which contract will we end up (doubled) in now?|pg||

nt|sybarra: sorry meant 3/2,  obviously early in morning for me |pg||
nt|haans: easy make :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: a tough contract|pg||
nt|mcphee: do you think he was lucky to escape for 1 down?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: previous board 2@h met same destiny|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes i think so|pg||

nt|daman: no doubled contracts this time|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: if he wasn't passed hand then 2@d would've been GF|pg||
mb|1H|nt|szalay: in that case I wd go out for water, to refresh myself|pg||
nt|ady: an easy 3NT  played by south|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes|pg||
nt|sharkey: E has the "perfect" Dbl hand|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 23-17 this time, another interesting board|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: they even played after the claim..|pg||
nt|szalay: Frenchmen are very conservative with 4card other major|pg||
nt|ady: at least 10 tricks in hearts for e/w|pg||
nt|ady: west decided not to open|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Also, yes|pg||
nt|szalay: logic is more important than defence agreements|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: 4@s?|pg||
nt|daman: I might have to eat my words :)|pg||
nt|daman: yes|pg||
nt|haans: yes full standard|pg||
nt|sybarra: great slam here |pg||
nt|haans: good 3@H|pg||
nt|mcphee: pretty easy 4@H here|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: can they make 6@D|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|h_karluk: uh oh. 1@s ? hmmm :)|pg||
nt|pelu: his problem was the 4 card @s|pg||
nt|ady: west wasting no time  4@D  is for hearts|pg||
nt|szalay: I agree with xfer to 4@H: IF we have weak 6card and strong 4card major, kinda stayman is preferred|pg||
nt|szalay: in Hungary we had a 1st class teacher/player in 60s, called Lajos Widder|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 2NT in N for minor|pg||
nt|szalay: his favourite proverb was: "I hate maths...only important thing is: all players has 13 cards and all color has 13"|pg||
nt|daman: I must admit    I would have bid 2@H with the West hand|pg||
nt|haans: both makes|pg||
nt|daman: 1@S seemed timid|pg||
nt|chick: too strong for Michaels|pg||
nt|daman: no way|pg||
nt|chick: 1@S, then 2@D shows the hand much better|pg||
nt|haans: best is 5@H now|pg||
nt|daman: classic Michaels|pg||
nt|h_karluk: kinda cake and walk|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: 3 NT|pg||
nt|copeyj: great grand|pg||
nt|haans: many play X showing minimum|pg||
nt|mcphee: oh some relay hand type with 2@C|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|szalay: terrible slam, imho|pg||
nt|rnmalik: a @C can be pitched on @S but they dont know:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: likely to play 2 @H's here|pg||
nt|szalay: in Hungary we play Michaels a bit different way than World do|pg||
nt|szalay: NOT weak or strong, rather "at least inv values, no upper limit"|pg||
nt|haans: gazzilli|pg||
nt|haans: anything but 2@D is weak|pg||
nt|sybarra: a grand even but is it biddable  (7 @D?)|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: dont they play Drury?|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: During the white house juniors very nice weather last few years|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: Dennis Bilde had his moment on the first board. now 1 highpoint average over 3|pg||
nt|haans: best game 3nt but ...|pg||
nt|szalay: Lazar could NOT bid 3@D as P/C, cause its inv with @S|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i guess W accept invitation, wldn't decline|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|frankaus: water? - do u know what fish do in water :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: those hands are usually easy to bid :)|pg||
nt|ady: natural    should have had a 5th club|pg||
nt|haans: no way to show @D :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: how about pass :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: he already had 3@c in his hand..|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: practically|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Yes - E/W need a quiet board|pg||
nt|szalay: I think South's hand is close to 2N, imho|pg||
nt|daman: hard to bid 2@D over 3@H|pg||
nt|chick: Michaels is a preemptive bid, he does not need to preempt|pg||
nt|haans: 3@H usually no defensive tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: so 3@D is natural and weak?|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: yes|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 2@s would show a non-constructive raise I suppose, so he has to bid 3@d. N can now bid 4@h which will be corrected to 4@s and that should be the final contract|pg||
nt|haans: yep 2@D is GF|pg||
nt|haans: if p is strong|pg||
nt|haans: any bid now strong hand|pg||
nt|copeyj: 7NT on ice - and they will bid it no problem|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes 7 mnt also |pg||
nt|copeyj: when south gets to ask for aces|pg||
nt|haans: rkc show @DQ and off|pg||
nt|marlowepi: generally disappointing to be in 4th seat when holding a hand like N, but here she gets to bid before EW have shown spades anyway|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: kibs asking 6@D      can make    but bad contract  |pg||
nt|h_karluk: no way|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: but last moment rethink :P|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No - Jacks are doubtful values and 3-3-3-4|pg||
nt|daman: michaels is a descriptive bid    doesn't have to be preemptive at all|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: what a sad way to end a bidding|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 3@d is the worst thing Adam can hear, maybe 3@h is even enough|pg||
nt|po-s: 2spades would not be constructive at all|pg||
mb|3N|nt|szalay: I think 9 hcp with ruffing values is more than regular 10 hcp|pg||
nt|ady: 2@S  2nd negative|pg||
nt|pelu: great bid!|pg||
nt|haans: clubs lead ?|pg||
nt|szalay: I think 6@C is very optimistic, especially in all white|pg||
nt|szalay: all white is NOT a position where u need be greedy|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|chick: that's the normal way to play it ... preemptive or 18+ ... but of course you can do as you like :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Do you get a bonus when you have 14 top tricks?|pg||
nt|sybarra: and "flops" well as Henri would say |pg||
nt|haans: easiest grand in a long time|pg||
nt|copeyj: he will be able to count 12 tops|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: likely 11 tricks, next one|pg||
nt|ady: trump switch  will hold to 10|pg||
nt|marlowepi: many would bid 4H nonvul since EW have not found their spades yet|pg||
mb|4H|nt|rnmalik: agree was an observation|pg||
nt|pelu: 9½ out of 10 will lead @S|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|pelu: ½ lead @d! :)|pg||
nt|ady: natrual spade lead 9 tricks    this likely to be a swing for Australia|pg||
nt|Walddk4: All results (including butlers and hand records) at www.nbbportal.nl/1003/ > 'competitie'|pg||
nt|szalay: r u sure?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No intermediats|pg||
nt|rnmalik: N found no defense to 5@H and has settled for -2 as we see|pg||
nt|chick: I wonder what the difference between that sequence and 1N 3N is|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like 3NT has 9 tricks via 3@s , 2@h, 2@d and 2@c|pg||
nt|xenya: this rates to make  think|pg||
nt|haans: my guess 2@S 2nt replacement|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, Hans|pg||
nt|copeyj: and his part must have osmething extra for 15-17|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: important thing after bad boards: leave table for a while and reconnect:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: All Israels I know play drury, maybe west didnt think his hand was good enough\|pg||
nt|ady: club lead will need spades 3-3 to pitch losing club   and heart lead will need king well placed|pg||
nt|sybarra: wrongsided this one|pg||
nt|frankaus: 3nt will make with the   @HJshort|pg||
nt|pelu: no|pg||
nt|szalay: trump LEAD does it|pg||
nt|ady: sorry   meant trump lead|pg||
nt|szalay: cause North could lead 2nd one|pg||
nt|szalay: I think to lead trump is close to suiced from South's seat|pg||
nt|rnmalik: and no DBL|pg||
nt|szalay: of course, it could make for 3-3 @S, but: in that case 5@HX is at least 500, can be 800|pg||
nt|szalay: I dont like to save|pg||
nt|szalay: I like when WE score|pg||
nt|haans: direct 5@H more angry|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and maybe natural way was easy to reach 4@h |pg||
nt|yo_yo: dont think!|pg||
mb|4S|nt|Walddk4: He will get @CK after 5NT now and can count 13|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: Thomas came here yesterday, from Reno, and he had to go with plane to Paris and then with Train here... |pg||
nt|mcphee: n/s will need to grab those tricks or possible they will go away|pg||
nt|mcphee: uh oh|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: weak responder 2 jacks|pg||
nt|haans: easy to raise @D|pg||
nt|xenya: this may be a swing as pass by W over 1N is a fair option|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|xenya: not for juniors perhaps though|pg||
nt|daman: http://www.bridgeguys.com/Conventions/MichaelsCuebid.html|pg||
nt|po-s: Did I forget system now ? what has he shown???|pg||
nt|mcphee: E has pushed the envelope|pg||
nt|h_karluk: uh oh seems W's 3@s caused some misunderstanding there|pg||
mb|4N|nt|vugraphzeg: kleine kamer|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think an imaginary problem there : say east has AQ96-KT983-7-J42, okay guys, would bid 1@h or still double over 1@d? my opinion : if East wld X with that  hand then 2@d cue by W ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: gr8 :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: Probably take @C finesse and end up with 11 tricks|pg||
nt|szalay: and his pd has strong hand: give her the last decision:)|pg||
nt|haans: they have a diamond loser|pg||
nt|haans: i think 2@S had been a better bid|pg||
nt|po-s: nor is any bid except 2D - except possibly in some partnerships: 2H|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: right, I meant like xxx xxx KQxx xxx or something|pg||
nt|haans: well 3@D did say no slam today|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: it's all in there|pg||
nt|yo_yo: what system do they play?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that's the question|pg||
nt|mcphee: what ever it is someone bid too mcuh|pg||
mb|5H|nt|vugraphzeg: oops that was personal|pg||
nt|ady: clubs blocked fortunately|pg||
nt|sybarra: so you get lucky sometimes |pg||
nt|ady: east condiering unblocking  hoping 10@C with west|pg||
nt|h_karluk: with that junk even they show me full hands i could not dare to land 3@c|pg||
nt|haans: @CJ not cover not two entries to dummy|pg||
nt|copeyj: Volcker didnt bother|pg||
nt|haans: i say flat board|pg||
nt|copeyj: grand likely to be laydown, and very few hands from north could make it a bad grand i guess|pg||
nt|po-s: It seems Thomas has travelled the world - he has forgotten that in France it is forbidden to open 1NT with a 5card major|pg||
nt|copeyj: guillotine offence isn't it, Po?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Not among juniors, PO|pg||
nt|sybarra: must be only in france, no 5 card majors in 1 nt?|pg||
nt|po-s: T plays with his dad mostly, don´t forget|pg||
nt|sybarra: if he opens 1 @S, doesnt have a good rebid |pg||
nt|haans: in sweden we have had 5c M for 60 years in 1nt|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Worst case scenario is @CQJ, @HJ and @SJ|pg||
nt|yo_yo: and has West shown a NT shape?|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: lack of intermediates is what I see as the big problem -- half of S's hand is 5 or below|pg||
nt|Walddk4: And then the grand still has play|pg||
nt|h_karluk: dangerous height|pg||
mb|p|nt|po-s: probably the Hockey club|pg||
nt|mcphee: :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 2@c+1@d obvious losers|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and leader has not much difficulty to cash|pg||
nt|mcphee: S has no other defence than to cash out really|pg||
nt|yo_yo: well i wondered when Kopecky reached that game earlier, if they would over reach soon|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: likely 10 IMPs|pg||
pc|cK|nt|VugraphPl1: http://michzimny.pl/bridge/2010/pila/gp.html|pg||
nt|ady: back to 10 maybe|pg||
nt|szalay: why @D?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ady: good play that unforunately gets no reward|pg||
nt|sybarra: valiant try |pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: both north and south complimented east|pg||
nt|sharkey: I wud bid 1@H|pg||
nt|haans: me 2|pg||
nt|hawe45:  North now asks himself: WHY did I take that trick?|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, declarer can't set up the long suit, so he should take Yuval's line|pg||
nt|xenya: and that's what he is doing it seems|pg||
nt|mcphee: this seems to be E being a bit too pushy I think|pg||
nt|po-s: If I bid four suits, of course I have a four-suited hand|pg||
nt|yo_yo: I guess Nabil will realise he has 3 tricks|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ady: yes|pg||
nt|szalay: its risky|pg||
nt|szalay: @C/@S is sure exit|pg||
nt|rnmalik: flat board|pg||
nt|szalay: when we need just 1 trick to set: lead safe is a basic rule|pg||
nt|szalay: just interchange Q and J of @D why was it terrible try|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so new score after this board expected as 23-0|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so that matters, 1@h just F1 fine|pg||
nt|haans: but how to get it|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|nt|sharkey: Think better let @C9 run as N pegged with @CA|pg||
nt|haans: or transfer bids|pg||
nt|haans: let overcaller lead :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: next...|pg||
nt|haans: best with void opps can not count their tricks|pg||
nt|marlowepi: on this deal 4HX would go for too much though|pg||
pc|c8|nt|Walddk4: Nah|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: I can't claim before they do|pg||
nt|pelu: we have a real top-match on here: France 1 = No 2 (126 VP after 6 matches) and NL Blue No 3 (113)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|szalay: after this bidding trump lead is nearly automatic, imho|pg||
pc|dT|nt|haans: had no reason to play @CK|pg||
nt|haans: 1 clubs loser deep finesse|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 10-13|pg||
pc|d6|nt|chick: and I quote:  " the accepted point count should be between 5 high card points and 11 high card points, although the strength is again a matter of the partnership agreement."|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|szalay: but Aces ar Aces:)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But you will find many 15/16 HCP-hands, who are stronger|pg||

nt|szalay: routine 3N/5@C|pg||

nt|sybarra: e/w can make a lot of hts here|pg||
nt|hawe45:  and they wiol get 450|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Not @D 7 - 7 @D|pg||
nt|hawe45:  but only 12 tricks|pg||

nt|haans: 13 14 in my book|pg||

mb|1S|nt|sybarra: yes|pg||

mb|p|nt|ady: 20-20 again|pg||
nt|yuval10: S will be surprised to see his P opening|pg||
nt|h_karluk: just hook @h K and have fun|pg||
nt|szalay: I wd use exclusion RKC after xfer by South: 4@D-4@H-4@S/N (depends on RKC-style)|pg||
nt|h_karluk:  3 S had 0, now E has 1|pg||
nt|ady: 20-20 |pg||
nt|ady: however Netherlands got the 7 imps back hand 2  geting to game  where France stopped in 2NT|pg||
nt|daman: duh|pg||
nt|mcphee: well smashing 5@D looked like a good idea at the time for E I suppose:)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that's a shame for the Czechs  |pg||
mb|1N!|nt|vugraphzeg: south had 1 on 4 aswell and 2 on 2|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but a shot in the arm for the Aussies|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: pass by E?|pg||
nt|haans: agree with that pass|pg||
nt|szalay: btw I wd bid 3N immediately here: dont give them chance for right lead |pg||
nt|szalay: slam is very unlikely|pg||
nt|ady: n/s haved a choice   5@C  or 3NT     3NT scores better|pg||
nt|pelu: the 8. @C is the key-card for direct 3Nt - u dont need an H in @C from pd|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @S-lead might bring 480|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No...|pg||
nt|szalay: it requires a perfect sys and silent opps to bid it|pg||
nt|hawe45:  So am I - no double is OK|pg||
nt|szalay: 6+5+2=13|pg||
nt|haans: all jumps are not weak :)|pg||
nt|daman: on with the show|pg||
nt|copeyj: normal 4@S here for N/S|pg||
nt|copeyj: wonder what thomas will chose|pg||
nt|sybarra: think I will stay in 4 and hope for the OT|pg||
nt|haans: vul but off u go|pg||
mb|2D|nt|haans: easy to get -800|pg||
nt|mcphee: i think I might well take a swing at 5@D also|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Kopecky will be bent on revenge and might well double them also|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: e/w have 9 tricks in spades as they lay|pg||
nt|yuval10: indeed, if 4@s is exclusion |pg||
nt|szalay: bid 6 or 7 depends on answer|pg||
nt|sharkey: Wonder if S knows what to do with all the points  - he'll probably drop stiff @SK to maje 4@S|pg||
nt|sharkey: *make|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and that's 10 boards sets, presumably predealt hands|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think that's wild|pg||
nt|sharkey: S may raise...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think i wld bid 3@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: he did, west goes into the tank now|pg||
nt|haans: west  do not promise @SK|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i dislike 3@d with 16 there|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - Vul at IMPs think it's right|pg||
nt|pelu: 2Nt = I can help in @c|pg||
nt|pelu: what can S bid now ? X for @S-stop?|pg||
nt|ady: not sure it right to settle for 3NT  switch K@D with A! north and west  then 6@C makes and 3NT down 1|pg||
nt|ady: k@D   and A@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: double on 2@S? Would  anybody else do that?|pg||
nt|ady: no   |pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: maybe my question also gives my opinion :)|pg||
nt|pelu: no X - in my book 5-card - or very strong 4-card suit - u can exp that pd bid 4@S over 3NT|pg||
nt|haans: stay low here|pg||
nt|haans: look 2+ is ALERTED all to learn|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: not alerted by Adam by the way.. but then again, he has so many|pg||
nt|haans: :) most forget it|pg||
nt|haans: going slamming|pg||
nt|copeyj: 4@C = shortage in @C game values 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: trash Stayman|pg||
nt|copeyj: wont make Volcker excited|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Wud you pass and hope they land in NT?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: thanks Dennis :)|pg||
nt|haans: but give east a @D ruff then...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: now i pass to 4@d|pg||
nt|sharkey: After 1 NT opening West likely to be on lead anyway|pg||
nt|haans: and they are non vul|pg||
nt|pelu: I am with u Tim|pg||
nt|szalay: 2N: 14+, bal|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Yes - back to my first view|pg||
nt|szalay: 2@D was nat and GF|pg||
nt|xenya: NS might get in trouble now|pg||
nt|yuval10: 3@d by N perhaps?|pg||
nt|haans: 2@H = strong hand|pg||
nt|henryb:  pass perhaps?|pg||
nt|xenya: but just might -- N can rebid @Ds and S should pass|pg||
nt|haans: intermediate?|pg||
nt|copeyj: I am amazed Volcker has cue bid|pg||
nt|copeyj: he has nothing in partner's primary suit|pg||
nt|copeyj: he has a terrible holding in the splinter suit|pg||
nt|haans: spade 4-1 i say a killer |pg||
nt|copeyj: and he only has 4 trumps|pg||
nt|copeyj: North is pretty minimum, but he does have the nuts in controls|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W can;t be too comfortable doubling on that hand, but pass is too dangerous|pg||
nt|mcphee: oh my|pg||
pc|d9|nt|szalay: to stay at the table is a bad habit..I think no kinda rule in bridge|pg||
nt|szalay: if North says 3@D exclusion RKC could help...and later a grand slamtry:|pg||
nt|haans: normal opening bid?|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: no, 2@h is weak, but with partner who passed it can still be strongish|pg||
nt|haans: ok ok|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 22-18 obligatory pass by S|pg||
nt|mcphee: it is often bad to pass with 5 trumps|pg||
pc|d5|nt|haans: 2@H help me now|pg||
nt|ady: west trying to scramble to a better spot|pg||
nt|szalay: North wd accept with source of tricks, for sure|pg||
nt|szalay: I dunno why to ask stopper with QJx|pg||
nt|haans: rite u r|pg||
nt|daman: maybe a low intermediate|pg||
nt|daman: 10-13|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: brave man|pg||
pc|d2|nt|VugraphPl1: sorry|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like a misunderstanding here|pg||
nt|sharkey: 4@D is crazy ....|pg||
nt|haans: wd|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think one should double when he/she's sure for -2|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|sharkey: West gets whathe asked for|pg||
nt|davidb: hi good evening|pg||
nt|h_karluk: just curiosity, when someone would intervene?|pg||
nt|szalay: 4@D was optional RKC|pg||
pc|dA|nt|szalay: std polish lead: low from doubleton|pg||
nt|ady: looks like down 1|pg||
nt|yuval10: but it will turn on the right side for NS|pg||
nt|h_karluk: bid 6 make 7 now, bid 7 go down 1 when @h K fails in a different layout|pg||
nt|daman: I have been told it is 9-13|pg||
nt|mcphee: S erred here big time IMHO|pg||
pc|s4|nt|yuval10: 4NT probably interpreted as 1430 by S|pg||
nt|sybarra: awkwardly,  but "we" landed |pg||
nt|szalay: bad hand, 2KC and queen|pg||
nt|szalay: but he has 0:)|pg||
nt|copeyj: they are heading for slam now - they have 4/5 keys and Q trumps|pg||
pc|d6|nt|haans: 4m for me only as invite to 5|pg||
nt|haans: as good as 1nt ruffing @D|pg||
nt|ady: yes  nice contract    I dont agree with 3NT immediate |pg||
nt|po-s: Even 3-2 in trumps is nad enough if same hand has two diamonds|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|ady: should east have removed to 2@S  with 3 in each?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think many would double to show equal strength|pg||
nt|haans: you win some lose some|pg||
nt|sybarra: likely to play for the drop in @H's |pg||
nt|hawe45:  4 boards 50 minutes|pg||
nt|xenya: exciting|pg||
nt|haans: dinessing inh spades|pg||
nt|yuval10: very good X by E, sensing the misfit|pg||
nt|haans: raise @D|pg||
pc|h3|nt|xenya: but can they beat 3N?|pg||
nt|haans: if decl play spade = go up with Q|pg||
pc|h8|nt|szalay: some players play GF means: "forcing to 4-of-minor if 3N not possible"|pg||
nt|szalay: I predicted small slam|pg||
nt|szalay: good play is often slow play, imho|pg||
nt|haans: may still be a flat |pg||
nt|copeyj: what would you lead as west?|pg||
nt|copeyj: QX@D looks like a terrible holding|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: Thomas is hoping he has some extra's tho|pg||
nt|po-s: difficult lead|pg||
nt|haans: some say with 4 trump lead one|pg||
nt|copeyj: Volcker is, by the way, in the final of the French Open Trials - he defeated Bessis in the semi final!|pg||
nt|po-s: HJ perhaps??|pg||
nt|copeyj: and apparently Bessis is sat at the table writing out their convention card our operator tells me!|pg||
nt|copeyj: A trump has been suggested by some kibbers - but QX@D puts me off that - I would lead a @H and then it is a question of which @H to lead|pg||
pc|hK|nt|haans: Hung may hope for 2nt from W|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hi David welcome aboard|pg||
nt|rnmalik: could S on 5@D bid 5@S?|pg||
nt|szalay: play will be fast|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Can't make it with spades 4-1 and diamonds 4-2|pg||
nt|haans: now decl to think what took so long|pg||
nt|po-s: could you with spades 3-2?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Depends who has 2|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think i would definitely couldn't find that grand - when @h K wasn't at partner|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: fryklund was not sure about 4 nt answer so he bid 7 h lucky boy........|pg||
nt|h_karluk: wild but worked, congrats|pg||
nt|szalay: it wd be exclusion|pg||
nt|h_karluk: okay say N rebid 2@c (3+) really what could be S's rebid after 1N F1? :)|pg||
nt|mcphee: even if partner holds 3@D it is 100% clear to raise @D I think|pg||
nt|yo_yo: they lay out is a bit fortunate for NS |pg||
pc|h5|nt|h_karluk: shalom :)|pg||
nt|haans: 16 no good lead|pg||
nt|yuval10: E would've done better by ducking the @d|pg||
nt|henryb:  now that would not occur to me. I think X asks partner to lead MY suit|pg||
nt|haans: only one entry in spades|pg||
pc|h6|nt|yo_yo: 2 club losers and a H but they cant get to them|pg||
nt|po-s: The pass isn´t such a terrible decision (only pretty bad) considering his void in spades|pg||
nt|mcphee: assume N holds only 3@D, his likely shape is 5-3-3-2 making the S hand a great fit, do you not think so?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think with 0-4-5-4 and 2K+1Q after F1N not easy rebids there esp 2@c rebid (3+) comes by declarer|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ady: try a club|pg||
nt|haans: I would have played 2@H|pg||
nt|po-s: of course, but to consider the quality of the slam|pg||
nt|marlowepi: perhaps W thought that the double by E created a force (since E did not just bid some number of hearts at first turn). otherwise 4H seems questionable, with the poor minors. a ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: double pushing us to the 3-level should be 6 LTC so W doesnt have anything extra|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|sharkey: North is Lars Kirkegaard Nielsen - Jacco informs he insisted on being shown as K. Nielsen|pg||
nt|sharkey: looks like 500|pg||
pc|s2|nt|hawe45:  claim|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sybarra: spade switch now?|pg||
nt|sybarra: but all roads lead to -1 (or 2_ |pg||
nt|yuval10: not declarer has no problems at all|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Walddk4: It's a bad one, agreed|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|h_karluk: I think Denmark would win this set very easily|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Small @H is the only chance|pg||
pc|c3|nt|haans: :) easy make :)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|szalay: small @S now|pg||
nt|ady: should cash out for -1|pg||
nt|haans: no more spade = spades 4-1|pg||
pc|cK|nt|h_karluk: and maybe they convert IMPs to 20 VP scale, eh ?|pg||
pc|cA|pg||

nt|marlowepi: especially since bad breaks can be expected. |pg||

nt|h_karluk: that's why i guess S passed confidently|pg||
pc|s5|nt|haans: and 3 Q|pg||
nt|marlowepi: right|pg||
nt|haans: but 3@H may be forcing|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: West went for a toilet break|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but in my view W was right to think that the E auction created a force. I think it was E who overrated the value of his hand, with so much spade wastage, no shortness, and spades ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: due to be overruffed by N|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: they had a misunderstanding about 3@H forcing or not|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: East thought not, West thought it was|pg||
nt|haans: then we all agree|pg||
nt|mcphee: that is not the S hands decision to make though Kath|pg||
pc|dT|nt|po-s: Tim, which bid was worst?|pg||
pc|s9|nt|pelu: 2@H sh 4-4 or 4-5 - with 5-4 West could bid 2@S - still weak|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
mc|9|nt|daman: doink   claim |pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: S: " sorry"|pg||
nt|haans: 8 finesse 9 dont|pg||

mb|1S|nt|haans: time to bid 3@H|pg||
nt|szalay: probably 4@S silences everyone|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: leave table..and slower play...|pg||

nt|h_karluk: cold 4@s|pg||

nt|haans: easy slam here|pg||
nt|pelu: play to one goal - but Australia No 4 and NL-21 No 22 in the standing, so natural|pg||
nt|h_karluk: my guess EW would buy to 2/3 @s|pg||
nt|szalay: may be 3@S yet|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like 4@s for me with N's cards|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|mcphee: so if it is invite ahnd how can it be included in the F group?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: close hands|pg||

mb|1N!|nt|szalay: impossible to play with that speed|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hmm, 4 cards M|pg||
nt|szalay: but a lot better if they dont lead @D|pg||
nt|haans: 18-19 balanced hand (italian style)|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: 3@s super accept i expect by E|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Cold with 4 losers...|pg||
nt|haans: stronger than 3@C|pg||

nt|ady: yes   should be routine|pg||
nt|sybarra: ugh,  I would probably also open 2nt but looking at all 4 hands this will not be a success|pg||
nt|daman: if South had led the @H K    he could have switched to a @D after seeing dummy     the @H K is a standard lead in that situation      no guarantee to beat 4@S though since @Ds are ...|pg||
nt|daman: ...|pg||
nt|mcphee: 2@S 2N?|pg||
nt|mcphee: or 2@S 3@S?|pg||

mb|3S|nt|haans: preemts|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: S can "see" no hts in N |pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: 6@C looks cold to me here|pg||
nt|haans: slam here|pg||
nt|mcphee: some feel pass and 2N is a choice|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and 2@s rebid also, 3@s adventure <my review, my opinion>|pg||
nt|mcphee: S could try 2@C and hope to survie that|pg||
nt|po-s: the only way to convince anyonae that 2D-pass isn´t terrible would be to move the HA to West|pg||
mb|3N|nt|sybarra: but do you X|pg||
nt|sybarra: not so sure bidding 5 @D in tempo might not get them to 5 @H  but we will never know |pg||
nt|rnmalik: 2@S and @CJ and cross ruff possible|pg||
nt|h_karluk: now makes 3NT|pg||
nt|szalay: I dont use "congrats" in this case:) lucky is more normal:)|pg||
nt|sharkey: 3 NT on a @D lead|pg||
nt|haans: good q to all what did double mean? lead dummy or own suit|pg||
nt|sybarra: may flop into 3 nt but see judith using slow approach |pg||
nt|copeyj: Nab choosin just to invite with 4333 9 count|pg||
nt|po-s: I think 4C is a slight overbid. South has good trumps and a working HK plus ruffing value in diamonds, must definitely bid 4H, but then....|pg||
nt|copeyj: but Drijver tries 3N anyway on strength of his @C suit despite the minimum hcp|pg||
nt|haans: nothing wrong with 6n|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: true, :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: West held off after last hand... - not unexpected|pg||
nt|h_karluk: weird, W declined the invitation|pg||
nt|sharkey: 4@S set with @D shift|pg||
nt|haans: missin game not junior style :) sort of|pg||
nt|haans: you needed some thing like Blue clubs to find slam|pg||
nt|yuval10: once again NS will make their contract, probably with an overtrick|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: this should be 1 away without too much trouble|pg||
nt|haans: 15 with a lose Q|pg||
nt|Walddk4: They both had borderline hands. I don't think 4@C is a serious overbid with all those controls|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 7 controls, AKxxx suit|pg||
nt|copeyj: Volcker must switch to @H when he is in with the @CK |pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: What wd u lead from T962?|pg||
nt|sybarra: 10 |pg||
nt|szalay: I think either 6 or 2 (depends on your methods)|pg||
nt|szalay: T is not a honour:)|pg||
nt|szalay: u can waste interior cards that way...watch it now...|pg||
nt|xenya: on 1, the Poles in the other room wound up in 4@H -- strange contract. 11 imps to Israel|pg||
nt|szalay: with appropriate entries declaler could have 4 tricks now|pg||
nt|szalay: it looks another good board for Dutch 2suiter methods|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: cant take 10 tricks, imho|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @s Qj drops, wow|pg||
nt|haans: naturally or bid it :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: meanwhile that's a mirror hand|pg||
nt|daman: 3-3   and West can pitch a @C|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our next match, in about 45 minutes, will be France 2 vs Netherlands Red (leaders)|pg||
pc|h7|nt|sybarra: a scramble but can find 9 tricks |pg||
nt|copeyj: I dont think so Shirley|pg||
nt|mcphee: 3@S a tad pushy with this suit I think|pg||
nt|po-s: no Barry, one is enough, don´t overdo things|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i only see 3 Aces and a tenace, no quick tricks, just 6223|pg||
pc|h5|nt|h_karluk: i was polite - meant 'congrats - with murder in my heart' :)|pg||
nt|chick: I think the usual meaning of the double is lead my suit, but if both have bid a suit, it's lead the non-normal one|pg||
nt|haans: very hard to avoid|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it's a bit pushy but 2@S  doesnt seem enough|pg||
nt|po-s: Is South trying to compenate for his earlier pass?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think there's not extras|pg||
nt|po-s: compensate|pg||
nt|mcphee: y Kath it doesn't, but for me a major overbid|pg||
nt|yo_yo: there's something to that, especially when we hear North was upset|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and 1NT is closed box, maybe good or bad, who knows, say good still pulls, say bad, nice stop|pg||
nt|mcphee: well if 1N is bad, 3@S is likely going to fail|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that's why i advocated 2@s nice stop|pg||
nt|po-s: H7 lead may prove costly|pg||
nt|yo_yo: specs are advocating a 2@C rebid by south  but i find that strange with a 6 card major|pg||
nt|mcphee: well if you survive 2@C it is not so bad|pg||
nt|h_karluk: count me in, no extras, no adventure|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes look at the @H spots|pg||
nt|po-s: why would 3S go down?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: in worst scenario during auction PO|pg||
nt|mcphee: facing a bad hand it might not even make 2 PO|pg||
nt|h_karluk: yes, that's another possibility BOB, so minimum damage not bad, eh :)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|hawe45:  @D better than @C ib South|pg||
nt|hawe45:  in|pg||
nt|haans: must play one more @H psychic|pg||
nt|szalay: -200 is a bargain here|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|szalay: but South thought more undertricks, I believe|pg||
nt|ady: acw  king ace and those trumps  seems double right|pg||
nt|szalay: but he must switch to trump|pg||
nt|szalay: North count helped a lot|pg||
nt|ady: yes agree|pg||
nt|sybarra: pickling his own suit however |pg||
pc|sT|nt|hawe45:  No Lavinthal this @C 8...!|pg||
nt|chick: not me, I would open 1@D and rebid 2N ... I think HCP is an excellent indication of NT values, and I stretch of the standard HCP only with a strong source of extra tricks|pg||
nt|haans: you did last time we played 3ntxx|pg||
nt|haans: 3@C puppet i presume|pg||
nt|copeyj: now Bessis must switch to @H|pg||
nt|haans: hearts now down|pg||
nt|po-s: I said "slight" overbid, and if they have no other strong support bid then ....|pg||
pc|s8|nt|yuval10: 3NT would've been easier here|pg||
nt|szalay: when longer trump could be tapped, moysian (4-3) fit isnt so good|pg||
nt|yuval10: but it looks like declarer can still manage|pg||
nt|sharkey: sry - E doesn't have any useful pitch on @H10|pg||
nt|hawe45:  6 I mean|pg||
pc|s2|nt|szalay: why not 3N over 2?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: for our kibitzers let me try to explain : same shape at EW|pg||

nt|haans: ok|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: couldn't see, he's a big man|pg||
pc|hT|nt|h_karluk: i think coaches never allow psyches in junior level|pg||
nt|haans: well done|pg||
nt|xenya: E's double is beyond my understanding|pg||
nt|daman: Turley picked up 5 IMPs on Board 2|pg||

nt|copeyj: ouch|pg||
nt|mcphee: wow|pg||
nt|mcphee: will he get this right?|pg||

nt|Walddk4: 4@C usually contains a strong diamond suit, so I would be much happier with @DQ than @HK|pg||
nt|haans: defense losers more points than decl makes|pg||
nt|haans: was it a weak nt?|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: yes|pg||
nt|haans: ok|pg||
nt|haans: yep we all been there|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Adam will feel better now|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 21-19 this time|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: 24-16 again partscore|pg||
nt|po-s: ATxx.AJx,AKQxx,x  is opener´s hand. If he gets 4S, should he bid again??|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|szalay: 5431 is a good treatment|pg||
nt|szalay: Poles invented 5431-convention|pg||
nt|hawe45:  East will welcome a @S-opening + do.-support|pg||
nt|haans: not 2 aces K = 1 contraol Ace 2|pg||
nt|haans: all may be in @D'|pg||
nt|sybarra: but at imps,  maybe not always prudent |pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: I always find the making lead when my partner doubles on principle :(|pg||
nt|xenya: yes perhaps it means: pd, we have more points than they -- but so what?|pg||
nt|daman: what would we bid with the South hand?  1NT?|pg||
nt|chick: giving juniors too many slam hands can result in bids at the 8 level :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: jump to 3M means: stiff major, 3card other major|pg||
nt|szalay: the weak nt|pg||
nt|szalay: East hand is interesting|pg||
nt|szalay: I wd rather dbl first and bid @S thereafter|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: (no entry back after ruffing finesse)|pg||
nt|szalay: easy 4@H/3N by E-W|pg||
nt|haans: best is 5@C/D|pg||
nt|yuval10: the favourable lie of the cards here mean that NS can make 12 tricks in both minors|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 3@s should end the auction, and poor W is almost endplayed already|pg||
nt|copeyj: Drijver will be pleased to see N bid 3@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: South alerted, almost bid 4@h, and then realised something|pg||
nt|mcphee: might beat this|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i wonder how EW in OR didn't pick 2@s with their 4/4 fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: especially usefull if u open 1N with 5card M|pg||
nt|sybarra: and will be happy to defend even undoubled |pg||
nt|h_karluk: oh because of 12-14 weak NT|pg||
pc|h7|nt|frankaus: true but transfer then bid game what do u loose?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think 1N then 2@s good, so you can play direct 2@s raise 8-10|pg||
nt|haans: x with void can be costly|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 2@c rebid then 2@s rebid, so all pass would also be nice|pg||
nt|szalay: In my book REOPENING 2@H shows kinda hand, what West has|pg||
nt|hawe45:  3 NT is the best spot|pg||
nt|szalay: so NO W2 in balancing seat|pg||
nt|daman: the double is probably t/o for the majors?    it was alerted|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: yes|pg||
nt|daman: S should pull|pg||
nt|haans: agressive|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: I guess I spoke too soon, maybe I should be disqualified as a junior|pg||
nt|h_karluk: same story here|pg||
nt|mcphee: @H lead possible and that gives it away, hi @D also possible to take a look see and it hits gold|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|szalay: routin 3N is coming|pg||
nt|szalay: so here 1N-3@H-4@S|pg||
nt|ady: can make 6@S as they lay|pg||
nt|pelu: back - with cofee :)|pg||
nt|szalay: but its close decision, anyway|pg||
nt|szalay: I wd bid my suit if its NOT the highest ranking one|pg||
nt|daman: uh oh|pg||
pc|h2|nt|szalay: if no trump lead/switch: he will ruff a @D|pg||
nt|frankaus: now is X pen?|pg||
nt|szalay: "who has the @Ss, has the power"|pg||
nt|szalay: as Lenin said 93 years ago|pg||
nt|szalay: (sadly he used "sowiets" instead of @s..he could play bridge|pg||
nt|szalay: could not|pg||
nt|szalay: btw did u know our games hero, Culbertson left Russia after Revoultion?|pg||
nt|szalay: his father was a civil engineer there|pg||
nt|haans: xenya we have all been there|pg||
nt|haans: 1@C mbs did cost this time|pg||
nt|xenya: well at least W avoided being endplayed|pg||
nt|haans: North have a lot of card for his 3@S|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|sybarra: so 2 @S transfer to minor? |pg||
nt|szalay: but they wont bid with missing ace and trump queen|pg||
nt|pelu: over 4@C and no @D-cue West would know|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 4@H is a very poor game. It requires more than the diamond finesse|pg||
nt|haans: poerknight: yea but if u hear 4 controls and see 3 kings in ur hand it can only be 2 aces and riye he is|pg||
nt|pelu: so NL on the scoreboard|pg||
nt|haans: @HJ may cost|pg||
nt|yo_yo: whenever I dont lead from my AKx  partner always has 5|pg||
nt|mcphee: :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so @d K lead could save the day for NS|pg||
nt|yo_yo: whenever I do, it's declarer's suit|pg||
pc|c3|nt|h_karluk: i think passive trump lead auto there|pg||
nt|szalay: best defence is: cash 3 winners and @C|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - West should know pd's loaded; however, with 4 HCP too weak|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and maybe @h3 would give a better idea - say 3/5 leads thoroughout in sys card|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i did not get that 2@h|pg||
nt|chick: in balance seat, 2@H should show good 6 hearts and opening hand|pg||
nt|daman: I think the opps get their 7 before he gets his 7|pg||
nt|yo_yo: how,  how not to block the @D suit|pg||
pc|c2|nt|szalay: in my book that is a slamtry in M, balanced|pg||
nt|szalay: to lose balanced slamtry with 6bagger is gap, anyway|pg||
nt|yuval10: now declarer can play A and Q@c discarding @s|pg||
nt|szalay: no ruffing finesse is suggested|pg||
nt|szalay: no 100% line, and could be lead from doubleton, but that is the best line, imho|pg||
nt|h_karluk: because you have 2 aces and 3 times trumps, whenever you are in can easily work to cut a ruff|pg||
nt|haans: many do not pen until opps reach game|pg||
nt|h_karluk: while found 5/2 @s fit why he got risk , hard question to reply|pg||
nt|davidb: easy  X  by N  -Ns  at least 6 trumps & more points|pg||
nt|haans: pass on 1nt = balanced hand|pg||
nt|h_karluk: F1N not in sys?|pg||
nt|szalay: back...its the most boring set so far|pg||
pc|cK|nt|xenya: Poland got the 11 imps back quickly, when they stopped in game on 2 (6@H was the contract here) |pg||
nt|ady: north minimum  lacking aces   and wasted K@H  definately should settle for game|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Even on that lead, and with hearts 3-2, it can't make|pg||
nt|chick: there is no such thing as a preempt when opps have already quit bidding :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree Chick |pg||
nt|hawe45:  The 800 was only 500 in OR - same contract, and same 2 NT from West|pg||
nt|xenya: that's true, Hans|pg||
nt|yuval10: 3NT is a bad contract but can be made|pg||
nt|yuval10: by double finessing the @d's|pg||
nt|haans: a make if no @D loser|pg||
nt|daman: if he doesn't cover   he might only get 5|pg||
pc|sK|nt|szalay: I think South could bid 4@H with 3 aces over 3@S|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that would help East to see South has only a @h card|pg||
pc|s2|nt|szalay: imagine North has spade Q instead of K of @H|pg||
nt|sybarra: so -1 here|pg||
nt|szalay: we can talk cause its an absolutely uniteresting making 2@S|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 3N seems like it should be doubled, but I really cannot see doubling from either side|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|pg||
pc|s6|nt|Walddk4: Our match in roúnd 3, in about 40 minutes, is USA vs Sweden|pg||
nt|haans: he he|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: uh oh|pg||
nt|daman: sweet|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I see your point, PO. The solution is perhaps to let a 2NT rebid be ambiguous and forcing. Then you have two ways of showing a singleton, either directly or via 2NT after responder ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: asks for clarification|pg||
pc|s5|nt|haans: we all seen it|pg||
nt|haans: first xx 3S|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s8|pg||
nt|haans: i have not seen Blue clubs having what is needed for many years But this time yes|pg||
nt|daman: now @S @S|pg||
nt|h_karluk: just overtake 3rd @d J with Q|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ady: should make the rest |pg||
nt|sharkey: good point - especially since dummy is dead|pg||
nt|haans: some play 2@H natural of weak raise|pg||
nt|haans: endplay possible|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sA|nt|daman: do we think North should have pulled?|pg||
nt|mcphee: will be all over soon and they will not have to worry about @D|pg||
nt|po-s: Hamdi, I´m impressed|pg||
mc|7|nt|yo_yo: :)|pg||

nt|petergill: At Trick 1, aA top @d elad has a lot going for it - in particular, you can see idf partner encourages @D's|pg||
mb|1C!|an|2+!C|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Many thanks to Andy, Liz, Peter and Avram|pg||
mb|1H!|an|4+!S|nt|petergill: on the last board|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S!|an|3!S|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Quite a few left in the Closed|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@S usually three spades in a weak NT hand. Not sure what this E-W pair plays, though|pg||
nt|petergill: Yes, the Czech pair are very thoughtful. Not slow, just thoughtful|pg||
mb|2D!|an|Art, GF|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 3NT would have been better if played by East|pg||
nt|Walddk2: where hearts are protected|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: Almost certainly the same system as I play with my 24 year old partner Paul Gosney who couldn't play in this event (so Aus has a team of five in Amsterdam) because he had to stay ...|pg||
nt|petergill: home and win our Open Trials instead. |pg||
nt|petergill: 2@D GF relay|pg||
nt|petergill: as in Two Way Checkback|pg||
nt|april7: in 4@S almost everything is wrong placed, so W will not be successful,but in 3NT W should make 9 tricks|pg||
pc|c5|nt|petergill: 1@S 3 spades 11-15 or perhaps 4 spades 11 - bad 13|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c8|pc|c9|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s7|pc|s6|pc|s2|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s8|pc|s9|pc|s5|pg||

pc|sA|pc|h3|pc|s4|pc|sK|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h2|pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c3|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hT|nt|petergill: Andy Hung (our young operator) is the System Expert for the Aussie youth. Whatever he thinks is best, most of us play it or a variation of it.  |pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||
pc|sT|pc|h9|pc|d4|pc|d2|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|d3|pc|h7|pc|dT|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d9|pc|dA|pc|dK|pg||
pc|d6|pc|c7|pc|d7|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|cuttysark: I suppose South could double the transfer to show hearts. SO North finding the lead of @H10 would raise some eyebrows|pg||
mc|9|nt|Walddk2: Thanks all, back in about 35 minutes with France 2 vs Netherlands Red. Bye for now|pg||
nt|vugraphzef: Thanks guys, hope you enjoyed it.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Bye all - enjoy the rest|pg||
nt|petergill: A nice result, plus 400, with 4@S in jeopardy if reached|pg||
nt|petergill: 4333 opposite 5332 - 3NT is often better than 4@S, especially at imps scoring|pg||
nt|petergill: Bye all. Thanks Andy and everyone|pg||
nt|april7: but even on 10 of @H lead  W should make 9 tricks|pg||
nt|petergill: Now that our fast table is finished, you can go to the other table to watch the slow (no, make that "thoughtful") players cope with the same hands|pg||
pg||
qx|c28|st||md|2SK87HKJ95DQ93C864,SA96H876DA864CAJ9,S52HT32DKT2CKT752,SQJT43HAQ4DJ75CQ3|sv|n|nt|sharkey: So W was correct in restraining himself|pg||
nt|h_karluk: however could set|pg||
nt|sharkey: coulda - woulda .....|pg||
nt|haans: small @D is good play again 4-2|pg||
nt|copeyj: some pairs play 2NT as artificial raises - works well but will generally mean you lose something elsewhere - like you have to open all 18-19 balanced hands 1@C not 1@D for example|pg||
nt|mcphee: I think Kath was referring to a @D lead from S|pg||
mb|1N|nt|rnmalik: any one for 6@C|pg||
nt|ady: 6@C  easy to make for n/s|pg||
nt|sybarra: nice lead director |pg||
nt|szalay: tough, nearly impossible slam to bid|pg||
nt|ady: hi Frank|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: Hiya Frank|pg||
nt|haans: hi :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  6-6 fit, rare up here in Denmark|pg||
nt|szalay: 3 slams make as N-S|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 6@C/@D|pg||
nt|szalay: do u use different shuffling machine there?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Probably|pg||
nt|haans: interesting hands|pg||
nt|daman: heard them in a poker game with bocchi|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzeg: big tell, to speak in poker terms: now Adam DOES alert|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i was :)|pg||
mb|2C!|an|5M|nt|h_karluk: you know sometimes even a nickel is important :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: rite :)|pg||
nt|ady: part score hand|pg||
nt|szalay: easy looking 4@H...but: gotta play carefully cause of bad trump break|pg||
nt|szalay: 6@S is makes yet|pg||
nt|szalay: but that is really terrible|pg||
nt|rnmalik: and 6@C|pg||
nt|szalay: personally I wd bid 6@C as south, P/C|pg||
nt|haans: you have to fight hard for every hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: likely 3 nt again or @D slam? |pg||
nt|haans: 6@S no make|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: q : x or 2N or 2@d?|pg||
nt|haans: good bid 1nt or more no spade|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 11 there|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and i saw N was leader|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|szalay: wd, Brigitta|pg||
nt|daman: hhhrrrmmmmm|pg||
nt|haans: Akkol still not happy but soon|pg||
nt|daman: Hopefully South won't hang his partner|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: uh oh|pg||
nt|haans: Tekir you have no pass notes?|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: she has gotten the hang of things|pg||
nt|daman: he has a great hand but he has to be conservative|pg||
nt|haans: Soth have no bid|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i see 12 tricks with in spired guess in spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: dont see other option than 3N now by North|pg||
nt|haans: urrk|pg||
nt|daman: sorry    she|pg||
nt|Walddk4: No more bad slams, please :)|pg||
nt|copeyj: well @D slam is pretty awful so I think 3NT|pg||
nt|mcphee: no no world team are leader:)|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|vugraphzeg: connection was rather slow|pg||
nt|szalay: personally my preference list by Sout over 1@H is:|pg||
nt|szalay: pass, 1N....period....2@C|pg||
nt|haans: suprised they do not play trf here|pg||
nt|sharkey: if it's a "coulda" - probably too close to x at IMPs|pg||
nt|ady: west overcall on 4 card suit understandable|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our next match (and last today) in about 40 minutes: Norway vs Italy|pg||
nt|haans: South endbid :)|pg||
nt|szalay: with likely plus for n-s, anyway|pg||
nt|pelu: easy 1@s - u dont X on 5 card major exp u are very strong|pg||
nt|rnmalik: X must with this hand|pg||
nt|szalay: in this case often happens save over 7@C:)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Why not 5 NT by South - pick a minor - and 6 @C =  MY suit|pg||
nt|chick: conservative?  juniors?  they are fearless!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I like "pretty awful"|pg||
nt|haans: 3@H means suits not 3-2 (that often)|pg||
nt|haans: so keept it cool|pg||
nt|haans: low spade to t and a slow make in slam|pg||
nt|marlowepi: low spade to ten is the winner, but from a technical/statistical standpoint it is the worst of the three ways to try and pick up the whole spade suit|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it wins only against stiff nine, and there are two alternatives each of which is twice as good|pg||
nt|haans: agree to that|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: North told East that she doesn't know what to bid|pg||
nt|marlowepi: playing an honor from dummy first succeeds in two cases (stiff J/Q), and triple-finessing W also wins in two cases|pg||
nt|marlowepi: how does that differ from simply huddling? does a trance mean "i know what to bid, but i want you to think i don't" ? :):)|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: I don't know.. she just told it, i think it means more, I have no clue, rather than I have to make a choice between 2 bids|pg||
nt|haans: for beginner yes that who the bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|po-s: better to bid 2H - then East will be reluctant to bid NT|pg||
nt|copeyj: 3@S here showing @S stop and concern about @H|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe be playing this from side I did not expect |pg||
nt|haans: 3@S showing spade stopper hearts ???|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The grand slam hand is played in 6@D next door|pg||
nt|copeyj: very surprising|pg||
nt|haans: u mean the automatic grand?|pg||
nt|sybarra: the 14+ trick slam |pg||
nt|copeyj: wonder if Nab is worried that 3@S is asking|pg||
nt|copeyj: must be I guess|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|szalay: do u see any reason not to pass 2@H?|pg||
nt|szalay: or a strength showing double is an option yet|pg||
nt|xenya: on 3, where Israel bid up to 5@D here, the Poles in the other room reached an even worse contract -- 3N -- 3 off and 3 imps to Israel |pg||
nt|h_karluk: in new year teams, we were tied 42-42, then 3 more extension boards, again tied, and last board just won with 1 IMP |pg||
nt|szalay: personally I wd bid 3N over 2N|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: there's you slam|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 13 IMPs to France but they may get most of them back on the very next hand|pg||
nt|Walddk4: All of them in fact|pg||
nt|sybarra: these are not beginners |pg||
nt|haans: 5nt slam force?|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: opposite a 12-14 Nt?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: uh-oh, the worst of all possible choices.......slow double|pg||
mb|p|nt|VugraphPl1: last board   thanks all |pg||
nt|daman: -1|pg||
nt|haans: i think 6@S was insulting p|pg||
nt|daman: unless they completely misdefend|pg||
nt|copeyj: can get away with this - can make 5@C or @D I think |pg||
nt|sybarra: 5 @C might stand a better chance |pg||
mb|3N|an|spades|nt|VugraphPl1: http://michzimny.pl/bridge/2010/pila/gp.html|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 @D by S?|pg||
nt|xenya: what do you think about N's double?|pg||
nt|frankaus: X do something sensible is a reasonable call |pg||
nt|sybarra: agressive?|pg||
nt|szalay: its normal, imho|pg||
nt|xenya: is it penalty?|pg||
nt|szalay: especially if u play sound overcalls..and send greetings to East for reopen|pg||
nt|xenya: penalty-orinted i should say|pg||
nt|szalay: 8-10, bid sthg, imho|pg||
nt|szalay: I doubt it|pg||
nt|frankaus: no here  - opps bid & raise  X = t/o|pg||
nt|szalay: btw if South passes and North bids @C a BIT easier, but isnt easy yet|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but makes with a lucky @d hook|pg||
nt|szalay: they play: minor ALWAYS P/C|pg||
nt|szalay: and NT means: I have a suit|pg||
nt|haans: assume 3nt show 5 @H puppet variation|pg||
nt|xenya: interesting 3N rebid: partner, i want to be in 3N even if you have 4 hearts? |pg||
nt|yuval10: there are no difficulties here with the play|pg||
nt|haans: 3@H = no major |pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: 3NT showing hearts, yes|pg||
nt|xenya: ah i see|pg||
nt|chick: actually, most of the interest in these hands has been the bidding|pg||
nt|haans: fiver|pg||
nt|xenya: thanks|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: I think North can double 4@S quite confidently|pg||
nt|szalay: or 3N yet..J9xxx in 1 suit, AK9x in other|pg||
nt|pelu: @D now will set up a ruff for East|pg||
nt|marlowepi: could be a director call|pg||
nt|marlowepi: slam makes on spade to ten|pg||
nt|haans: yep for sure |pg||
mb|4S|nt|szalay: I dont like to play lowlevel dbls as penalty|pg||
nt|xenya: so it was for minors|pg||
nt|szalay: good point, Frank|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: Lotan put the Hoody of the sweater on his head after being doubled|pg||
nt|szalay: to lead stiff in pds suit is tempting|pg||
nt|pelu: the set look boring - but in almost all matches we have seen strang mistakes that cist - here good bridge|pg||
nt|hawe45:  OK|pg||
nt|copeyj: notice the @C suit here|pg||
nt|copeyj: declarer can afford one loser in @C and one in @H|pg||
nt|sybarra: none of these slams are "pretty"|pg||
nt|haans: 3@S very close|pg||
nt|sybarra: or makeable?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but in practice will fail|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: but 3@H is 500? |pg||
nt|marlowepi: double??|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: no @H lead pls partner|pg||
nt|haans: psych?|pg||
nt|ritong: double= pls lead something else|pg||
nt|haans: or negative double = do not lead my suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: what did x mean?|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: Takeout?|pg||
nt|haans: their are at least 3 variation of puppet so i refuse to play any online|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i am hairless and fearless, they are supposed to have fresh and strong hairs :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  E/W got the chance...|pg||
nt|sharkey: this match could be a blowout|pg||
nt|haans: can East ever have 4 spades|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Yes - we all know, what England RED means - after this battle|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: typical agressive junior double|pg||
nt|frankaus: t/o do something sensible|pg||
nt|haans: many bid 1@S to show five x to show 4 |pg||
nt|h_karluk: 2@h+4@c+1@s + 5@d are his tricks|pg||
nt|szalay: with 28-29 hcp 3N generally is safer in 2 balanced hands, cause no bad trump break|pg||
nt|chick: 3@C may be checkback|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Dangerous double - no defence against 4 @C|pg||
nt|sharkey: I like Dbl instead of 2@S - EW lost the whole 1 level thus they end up in this hopeless contract|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But played by South, 3 NT is percect - NOT by North|pg||
nt|april7: lets see whether EW stays also out of 4@S|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i stand on my answer whichever direction leads|pg||
nt|po-s: did they know now ---yes|pg||
nt|mcphee: at last landing in 4@S on the final bid of the auction|pg||
pc|c2|nt|frankaus: if u beat it 1 - what have u gained  - canu really expect to beat it 2 or more?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: he leads, and has @d A, planned after @s A knocked out wld score many tricks to set|pg||
nt|po-s: 5D is laydown|pg||
nt|copeyj: so can play for either JT onside or K onside by playing one to the 9|pg||
nt|april7: after 3NT by E, W could have passed with 3-3-3-4|pg||
nt|h_karluk: friendly neighbor lead|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i dont like that lead|pg||
nt|mcphee: I am not at all sure that is correct April|pg||
nt|mcphee: the lack of @H stop facing what may be 2 small is not all the thrilling to play 3N|pg||
nt|april7: depends what 3NT meqans after 3@H by W|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|szalay: not to play Q was a clear error, imho|pg||
nt|szalay: ruff and trump now|pg||
nt|drorp: hashavti ze helgemo hamavrik mibenehem|pg||
nt|ady: bold action from east     found partner with a useful hand including 4 clubs|pg||
nt|haans: may we see a hearts lead?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Yes, @C9 is a significant card|pg||
nt|copeyj: you can in fact make this with an overtrick|pg||
pc|c8|nt|hawe45:  To me, this is the 3rd best lead from the East-hand|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|po-s: why not another club by East?|pg||
nt|haans: yes i can read (sry)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: now i see 9 tricks|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|sybarra: hate to lead a @H with the South holding |pg||
pc|s7|nt|szalay: its strange to me that no one plays 3@C as puppet to 3@D: in that case u can stop in 3@D (crucial if u respond 1M with longer @Ds)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Only @H is worse|pg||
nt|Walddk4: As expected, the Dutch pair stopped short of slam on board 5|pg||
pc|s6|nt|hawe45:  Well done - Jack = @D|pg||
nt|sharkey: If S had @CK this wud make|pg||
nt|haans: but if they have not hearts stopper hearts lead good|pg||
nt|po-s: how did Drijver know that partner had diamond support?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: A wife always has support for her husband|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|h_karluk: oh sorry i am wrong at @d|pg||
pc|s3|nt|h_karluk: and luckily @c K at his partner|pg||
nt|Walddk4: They may not quite be married yet, but ...|pg||
nt|copeyj: he can probably work out his partner has doubleton @S from the auction and that sort of suggests some @Ds, maybe if Nab had had lots of @C or something she would have acted over ...|pg||
nt|copeyj: 2@C i dont know|pg||
nt|haans: hurray|pg||
pc|s8|nt|szalay: making now|pg||
nt|pelu: 10 tricks on cross-ruff|pg||
nt|ady: could have got 200 from 1NTX|pg||
nt|po-s: and after this declarer play she might not want to|pg||
nt|ritong: so they reasonably stop in game with 31 hcp at best, balanced both hands|pg||
pc|s9|nt|haans: a make|pg||
nt|marlowepi: to all specs who have written me: i know it means don;t lead a heart, but it is far from clear that E wants to send that message, especially since the call gives NS more options in ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: th bidding|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|szalay: bad news: he knows going down|pg||
nt|szalay: good one: 50/trick|pg||
pc|sA|nt|szalay: N-S deserved their fate|pg||
nt|szalay: oops|pg||
nt|haans: 2@C may be the winner|pg||
pc|c5|nt|szalay: North was in driving seat at trick 2|pg||
nt|szalay: he forget to play @D early...it wasnt so bad: after @C lead he fears of @C ruff...not now|pg||
nt|daman: the only way to make this is the Sominex Coup    take 20 minutes to play the hand...put the opps to sleep....and make a false claim which they accept|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sK|pg||
nt|sharkey: Indeed - things are going the Danes' way|pg||
nt|hawe45:  West can play the @H 3 to the 4...|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Rare also|pg||
nt|po-s: I see ten|pg||
pc|d6|nt|szalay: he MUST solve it with xxxx trumps|pg||
nt|yuval10: and no X|pg||
pc|d2|nt|szalay: if we have small trumps, ruff and lead trumps generally the best move|pg||
nt|szalay: loser on loser, pls|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and say lead came by 3rd/5th, so deduct 10 from 2, 8 cards higher, 2 at table, 3 at hand, so playing Q safe and brings a tempo ahead, also preserves a further entry |pg||
nt|april7: N had a normal @H lead after this auction,but didn't lead it|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes lose 2@D|pg||
pc|d5|nt|szalay: is it true?|pg||
nt|xenya: this can't be right|pg||
nt|Walddk4: He did not treasure the @C9, a pity|pg||
nt|haans: 3nt at or|pg||
nt|po-s: down now it seems|pg||
nt|copeyj: he knows the likely @C distribution but now has to guess if south started with KJX or JTX|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Against good players it is with the odds to go down now|pg||
nt|sybarra: and there is bd 5 |pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|sybarra: 13 back to Neth. |pg||
pc|c6|nt|haans: who plays J whit KJx|pg||
pc|cA|nt|h_karluk: now @c A and @c J then @d J pitch even available, just transfers the ruff|pg||
pc|c7|nt|april7: since @D are 3-3 W has 10 tricks|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @dA marked|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Well, he survived, but we are not going to compliment him for his line|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|Walddk4: A good player does, Hans, and Volcker is|pg||
pc|cK|pc|sT|nt|xenya: but 8 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: sorry misclick\|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: he sure played Jack of spades|pg||
nt|h_karluk: moment of truth|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|hawe45:  next|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and still @h K hook try|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|haans: 500 was cheap|pg||
nt|h_karluk: got pure cash|pg||
nt|marlowepi: welcome henri:)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i wonder why Adam thought he had to make an aggressive lead|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|april7: y|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dK|pg||
nt|yuval10: A@c will squeeze declarer|pg||
pc|hT|nt|ritong: hi|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|yuval10: but i doesn't matter much here|pg||
nt|yuval10: *it|pg||
nt|szalay: sry, I have heard North is girl:)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|h_karluk: i am hairless and fearless, but Owen has long blond hairs, however in my book 3N quite interesting decision, well i think he'll not miss the chance to play in Gaitlinburg soon like ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: me and i'll make an interview to learn his thoughts right that moment :)|pg||
nt|daman: Chinese finesse|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|april7: overtaking and @C, @H finesse can still be made|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h7|pc|h2|nt|haans: en passant|pg||

pc|hA|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|d3|pc|h8|pc|h3|pg||

nt|mcphee: drum roll|pg||
nt|po-s: please, gentlemen, don´t judge the lead based on what the declaring side happens to have|pg||
nt|h_karluk: nicely done ? :)|pg||
nt|mcphee: oh S pitched one removing the guess|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: he went 2 of|pg||
nt|yo_yo: oh dear|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: finessing diamonds|pg||

nt|xenya: np Jacco|pg||

nt|hawe45:  A void in every second board or so|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and 5-0 break, just 4 %|pg||
nt|haans: sad really|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that's the penultimate board and huge difference|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: I'm strung between seeing Andy (Hung) win, since he's a good friend and see my team lose... Hmmmmm|pg||
nt|daman: credit to the Italians for bouncing NS into a hopeless slam|pg||
nt|daman: things will calm down a bid    just a partscore|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: still they are yelling at each other, wish I would have pait better attention during my Latin classes|pg||
nt|po-s: forum - did you find that?|pg||
nt|xenya: good small spade from N, holding declarer to 9 |pg||
nt|haans: good point roland|pg||
nt|april7: strong pass system???|pg||
mb|1D|nt|sharkey: EW have a lucky make in 5@D - limiting @D losers to 1|pg||
nt|haans: 30 min to next session|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ah well  maybe he got the wrong count|pg||
mb|2H|nt|szalay: in my humble opinion this level of the play is not good at U20 yet|pg||
nt|frankaus: -470 is not a good number on a scoresheet|pg||
nt|szalay: I think at least 8 serious mistakes in 8 bds|pg||
nt|ady: 20-20 again   no fit    |pg||
nt|ady: whoever plays likely to go down|pg||
nt|yuval10: very quick session it was|pg||
nt|pelu: a @d-lead set up @DJ to discard for a major-loser|pg||
nt|ady: must have slipped in defence to let 3@C through|pg||
nt|h_karluk: well, i do not see any reason to begin with 3@c at 1st seat|pg||
nt|pelu: but defense could still kill @dJ by ruff|pg||
nt|ady: diamond lead may set up J@D  but that can beruffed out when west wins ace of clubs|pg||
nt|haans: but why do N wait|pg||
nt|haans: easy pass|pg||
nt|pelu: with screen we often have 2 bids a time|pg||
nt|h_karluk: when you use a preempt at 3 level at 1st seat that's only against economy of space principle|pg||
nt|pelu: so it could be East in problem|pg||
nt|haans: pass all|pg||
nt|h_karluk: well, maybe they did not read our friendly yellow Gerardo's profile : rushers are added to enemy list :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: this has esculated|pg||
nt|haans: but 4@S a make 2|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: the hand got rotated|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think i would prefer 4@s|pg||
nt|pelu: would u bid 3@D?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: why not|pg||
nt|haans: if u pass 3@C sitting west can you miss game then?|pg||
nt|szalay: 1@S probably denies 4card @S, values|pg||
nt|szalay: I hate this convention, but no time to discuss it now|pg||
mb|d|nt|h_karluk: operator, undo?|pg||
nt|haans: sry :(|pg||
nt|rnmalik: very different bidding as compared to OR|pg||
nt|yuval10: W on the other room did very well by leading small @c against 3NT, let's see if it will be the same here|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: 2@D: NF (std Polish approx.)|pg||
nt|pelu: with a better @h-suit u could open 1@H but not with J high|pg||
nt|sybarra: just another "exciting" hand|pg||
nt|haans: i assume spade + minor (may be 4 @S??)|pg||
nt|haans: easiest @D to king = 9|pg||
nt|xenya: i don't understand this auction|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: 2@c was alerted I think, but I don't know what it means|pg||
nt|haans: 2@D must be conventional|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: he really bid 2H|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that's a fun bid, transfer overcall  passed |pg||
nt|h_karluk: in my book, 2@h tragedy|pg||
nt|mcphee: E can now find the @H lead to 3N which will cause a moments grief untill declarer sees dummy:)|pg||
nt|april7: 2 or 3NT? or is 2NT Lebensohl?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i can live with a simple 1@s overcall|pg||
mb|3C|nt|szalay: 3@C was @S raise|pg||
nt|sybarra: undoubled, that is good news |pg||
nt|ady: even undoubled  east west will lose several imps|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: OR led @d, let's see if they'll lead it again here|pg||
nt|yuval10: perhaps will opt to a @s|pg||
nt|h_karluk: seems bidding directions are wrong|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: nono, I bid correctly|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Only 180 degrees|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: cards are wrong. North is dealer but east has the west cards etc|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Not me|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think N would buy to 2@s|pg||
nt|szalay: double, pls|pg||
nt|chick: lebensohl sequence here|pg||
nt|yuval10: 2NT follows by 3@s i believe to ask stayman with @s stopper|pg||
nt|haans: 2 suits to cover |pg||
nt|haans: a good bid now is xx|pg||
nt|haans: if u have talked about it|pg||
nt|haans: dealy = no map |pg||
nt|chick: what would you play XX as, if you were S?|pg||
nt|xenya: tough for NS -- looks like they are in for a minus score now no matter what they might do|pg||
nt|po-s: - and if it means what you have agreed...|pg||
nt|haans: that would help|pg||
nt|yuval10: i only have pass and direct 3@s here.... Pass force for XX from S|pg||
nt|haans: hi sudden|pg||
nt|haans: how to find 5@D|pg||
nt|april7: true|pg||
nt|mcphee: and even seeing dummy may not make life so pleasing|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: doomed|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Rotten suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzeg: north and south also switched cards|pg||
nt|pelu: spects : 9-1 for pass :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: Kib avg age, Peter? :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i cannot use a double there because of @s Ax, i know the ovecall suit quality is not bright there |pg||
nt|haans: very like bidding prempt after prempt |pg||
nt|ady: this will be a slaughter|pg||
nt|haans: you just dont do that|pg||
nt|sybarra: and its j high with no good spots!|pg||
nt|hawe45:  In OR, South was no junior - passed in first hand, is that allowed in a junior-match?|pg||
nt|szalay: does anyone know meaning of bids?|pg||
nt|daman: no reason for South to bid|pg||
nt|chick: the OR has only played 5 boards (per the Movie), so it may be more than 30 minutes :)|pg||
nt|haans: fight every board|pg||
nt|xenya: anyway they reached a nice contract |pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: W: I hope you have really bad cards|pg||
nt|sybarra: puts pard (Nab) in difficult position |pg||
pc|s5|nt|h_karluk: to me good lead, could cost worse to a @d lead|pg||
nt|daman: who is foing the yelling now?|pg||
nt|daman: doing*|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: still the Italians|pg||
nt|mcphee: uh oh accident|pg||
pc|s6|nt|sharkey: the players probably took the wrong cards out|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: nope they all took their own slot|pg||
nt|sharkey: score 33-0 to Denmark and more to come...|pg||
nt|chick: in an auction like this, I would play 4@C as Stayman, but no idea what they do|pg||
nt|sybarra: yikes guys!! |pg||
nt|haans: Haans: who plays J whit KJx Walddk4: A good player does, Hans, and Volcker is doc_jo: is volcker a good player??? ->doc_jo: Roland say and Roland ... |pg||
nt|haans: puppet|pg||
pc|sA|nt|szalay: I confess I could pass as East automatically|pg||
nt|szalay: over 1@C|pg||
nt|daman: they just got +100 from thin air|pg||
nt|xenya: W has his hope i think |pg||
nt|yo_yo: maybe Nabil thought 3@C stronger than lebensohl 2NT?|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|sybarra: may make 6 now |pg||
nt|haans: holy ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: too much technical stuff for me, i only know on/off button and how to use a mouse :)|pg||

nt|h_karluk: omg, after long years i learnt to use email system:)|pg||

nt|vugraphzeg: tell oops was trying to contact someone else in the building|pg||
nt|hawe45:  And you might invite with 4 NT directly also|pg||

nt|rnmalik: some imps coming your way with X also|pg||
nt|szalay: she wears the jeans|pg||
nt|marlowepi: expect trunmpo lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: std. puppet auction |pg||
pc|s9|nt|frankaus: pass is the hardest bid to master in bridge :)|pg||
nt|szalay: light openings and overcalls they style can live cause another side|pg||
nt|ady: heart shift  best|pg||
nt|rnmalik: no other choice I think|pg||
nt|ady: hand 16 where west was down 1 in 4@H doubled   in OR  n/s made 4@D re-doubled|pg||
nt|ady: was 11 imps for world team|pg||
nt|rnmalik: compensation here for NS might gain some|pg||
nt|pelu: 4 out of 5 : I am junior :):)|pg||
nt|haans: psych|pg||
pc|s7|nt|hawe45:  Wonder what 1 @S was - since East introduced a suit with 7-6-5-4 at the 4-level|pg||
pc|c2|nt|szalay: I think to open 7-4 in white is good bridge, regardless of your age|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Now South likes his hand|pg||
nt|szalay: in white/red 4@C is an option, imho|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|h_karluk: could also play for divided @d honours|pg||
nt|h_karluk: seems preferred 3-3 35/6 %|pg||
nt|haans: 4th 5th spade|pg||
nt|hawe45:  That was what I tried to indicate..!|pg||
nt|chick: lucky for declarer, @SJ10 fall|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Still 2 losers|pg||
nt|szalay: likely 500 and 12 imps for Hungary..and: new leader:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: de Pagter wondering out loud whether Hop should've bid 2NT|pg||
nt|szalay: 1@S was: comp values, at most 3@S|pg||
pc|h5|nt|sharkey: we can follow jacco - just finsih the hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: true but the other table played the hand it was supposed to be played|pg||
nt|sharkey: Makes on low @C lead...|pg||
nt|haans: opinion: gronkvist: they must cancel the board gronkvist: will the laws says so|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|nt|szalay: u wont punish for light openings cause light overcalls and vica versa|pg||
nt|szalay: why not to take @C in hand?|pg||
nt|szalay: to start @D ruff?|pg||
nt|frankaus: maybe planning on a dummy reversal|pg||

nt|haans: still you have @D to K|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|sybarra: he may be thinking same thing,  maybe played too fast |pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: Now they're all saying I'm junior to me :P|pg||

nt|vugraphzeg: 1@s showing less than 4 @s's, 8+ hcp|pg||
nt|szalay: it looks 800 now|pg||
nt|daman: they should be hugging each other|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: not in their  blood i think|pg||
nt|marlowepi: making 5|pg||

pc|c5|nt|vugraphzeg: I could led the right guy lead but he led small club|pg||
nt|daman: nah  that's true|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|pelu: the problem are not 13-14 HCP - but the bad suit|pg||
nt|daman: and gelato|pg||
nt|po-s: I wonder if this was a Lebensohl situation for NS - 3C showed some values|pg||
pc|c7|nt|h_karluk: ok sir, thanks :)|pg||
nt|chick: yes, switch the @S8 and 7, different story|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ady: now K@C and club|pg||
nt|h_karluk: okay, say you entered the score, it helps to see in comparison? |pg||
nt|hawe45:  Not allowed|pg||
nt|po-s: yes but obviously declarer was afraid of getting a diamond played from North|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|h_karluk: well, seriously i do not think we can have ideal conditions at all times|pg||
nt|h_karluk: how they say? umm - lesser evil <my review>|pg||
nt|Walddk4: That's what pre-empts are for, but I don't think Edgtton had a serious problem with that hand|pg||
nt|h_karluk: soon east would be endplayed with a careful timing|pg||
nt|haans: opps in the dark|pg||
nt|szalay: the East probably didnt read Rodwell interview:|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think they play auto doubles|pg||
nt|po-s: his alternative would be 3NT|pg||
pc|d3|nt|szalay: to take trick first and think thereafter isnt a good omen|pg||
pc|d5|nt|sybarra: why not pitch ht|pg||
nt|sybarra: or is that the exit card?|pg||
nt|daman: East is in trouble |pg||
nt|marlowepi: trump lead will cause N to go right in spades|pg||
pc|dK|nt|haans: lavinthal for @H?|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @H pitchwas better but kept an exit card|pg||
nt|marlowepi: good duck by E|pg||
nt|haans: only 1 spade loser|pg||
nt|haans: so boring|pg||
pc|dA|nt|szalay: why Ten?|pg||

pc|d2|nt|szalay: but first: make plan, move after that|pg||
nt|ady: down 4|pg||
nt|haans: normal carding?|pg||
nt|po-s: perhaps declarer could figure out that North had the SK, and duck the spade|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i mean diamonds|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|haans: @H7 =========== no|pg||
pc|c6|nt|hawe45:  Entry-problems when decl sees the @D-layout|pg||
nt|sybarra: and possible he takes the @H's hook |pg||
nt|hawe45:  Which will lead to a HUGE score|pg||

nt|ady: thx all|pg||
nt|sybarra: Thanks also to our specs who give us helpful comments and some humor!|pg||
nt|szalay: does West have way to show @D lead?|pg||
nt|szalay: or may be HIS lead, even better:)|pg||
nt|ady: if west is on lead to 3NT  may choose a heart when east has shown majors|pg||
nt|szalay: a bit optimistic, but acceptable 5@C|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 7/5/1 long time not seen|pg||
nt|haans: 1@C mbs?|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@s in OR = 5 card @S + a minor|pg||
nt|rnmalik: no denying |pg||
nt|szalay: as many specs asked:|pg||
nt|xenya: something in that, yes -- if @Cs are 3-2...|pg||
nt|sybarra: Thanks also to my co commentators Simon, Hans, Roland and Po.  We appreciate your time, insights and humor.   |pg||

nt|vugraphzeg: yes play went very fast here so that is why|pg||
nt|szalay: fast play seldom means good|pg||
nt|frankaus: fine operating Jacco <clap> <clap> <clap> <clap>|pg||
nt|szalay: I think South has INV with @Cs, lets say 3@C is normal or 2N...|pg||
nt|pelu: by West|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Strange, that 6 NT went down - you have 12 tricks with safin the @D-suit and take the losing @H-finesse|pg||
nt|szalay: South is female and 16-years old only|pg||
nt|szalay: 3@D was Rubenshol: @Hs, inv +|pg||
nt|szalay: doubt West wd pass it|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: 3@D Switch, rather|pg||
nt|szalay: switch: dom and sub in one?:)|pg||
nt|szalay: South of course passes|pg||
nt|sybarra: LOL,  it was HOP,  I just followed what was on profile  |pg||
nt|mcphee: i think if N had @H stop they just bid 3N don't you?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i am OK with 1@h|pg||
nt|po-s: Adam shows that pass is never an option|pg||
nt|mcphee: providing 3@C shows somethng|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|vugraphzeg: it was west thinking but i try to do 2 bids at a time|pg||
nt|sybarra: this looks like it should make |pg||
nt|szalay: r u sure?|pg||
nt|xenya: i wonder|pg||
nt|szalay: 1@S, 1@H and how many @Cs?|pg||
nt|ady: looks like west has mis understood partners bid|pg||
nt|szalay: its Molenaar's double session|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: west might have explained this as weak with @d|pg||
nt|h_karluk: imho 5@c unbelievable|pg||
nt|haans: 3 down in 5@Cx|pg||
nt|haans: 2|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 2@C is not an overbid|pg||
nt|h_karluk: could any lead a trump from QT - say to 5 clubs contract? :)|pg||
nt|haans: 3@Dx|pg||
nt|szalay: thx all, it was fun, and interesting|pg||
nt|szalay: probably West, her screenmate is trhinking|pg||
nt|szalay: am I right?|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: correct|pg||
nt|szalay: Danke|pg||
nt|rnmalik: absolutely and difficult waters for EW|pg||
nt|szalay: 4@S RKC or rather cue?|pg||
nt|szalay: muddy waters, rather|pg||
nt|sybarra: next match: israel-Neth. blue|pg||
nt|haans: 20 min to next session|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: thats in about 20 min from now.|pg||
nt|sybarra: Our gratitude to the NBB for brining this wonderful tourney to BBO.  |pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: possibly 3@s would come|pg||
nt|xenya: http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=85&Itemid=79 for standings after 9 rounds|pg||
nt|haans: we thank you Shirley :)|pg||

nt|sybarra: Special thanks to Kees Tammens and Hans van Staveren, and sponsors Max Abram, Herman Drenkelford, Peter Sisselaar and Jos Janssens.|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: I think its going down for @S lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: yikes!!  here we go again|pg||
nt|szalay: 6@C for sure|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: East wasnt passing, I could tell you that|pg||
nt|xenya: E seems to have taken partner's 4@C too seriously|pg||
nt|h_karluk: what would you lead vs 5@c ? @h A/K or @s A+x ? :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: @C|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT the easiest as they lay    but likely to play 5@C  which would certainly go down to a trump lead   4@H can make|pg||
nt|haans: at last|pg||
nt|daman: thanks to th NBB for letting us bring this to you    thanks also to the Sponsors|pg||
nt|sybarra: Special thanks to Kees Tammens and Hans van Staveren, and sponsors Max Abram, Herman Drenkelford, Peter Sisselaar and Jos Janssens.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: bid 7S, get trump lead, double squeeze|pg||
pc|sK|nt|yuval10: E likes his hand|pg||
nt|haans: game at or|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i do not believe my eyes, 4261 with 6 hcp and 3@d 3rd seat both nonvul :)|pg||
nt|davidb: not a  lucky decision |pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: anyone dare interpret this auction?|pg||
nt|haans: a make (i think) :)|pg||
nt|haans: missed hearts so will we know|pg||
nt|sybarra: Special thanks to Kees Tammens and Hans van Staveren, and sponsors Max Abram, Herman Drenkelford, Peter Sisselaar and Jos Janssens.!|pg||
nt|haans: but no @SQ so no 7|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: the Next match broadcasted will be Australa agains Worldteam (Japan/czech combination)|pg||
nt|sybarra: Thanks also to our specs who give us helpful comments and some humor!|pg||
nt|ritong: not even 6 other room  extremely prudent|pg||
nt|marlowepi: cautious juniors--what is this world coming to?|pg||
nt|haans: :) good one :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E has to cue now|pg||
nt|haans: rkc|pg||
nt|marlowepi: especially if 2S showed six, and/or if not playing 3N vs. cuebid distingishes serious from nonserious slam try|pg||
nt|h_karluk: bye, c u next segment|pg||
nt|mcphee: Adam looking to get some back or give some away:)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|haans: dbl gazzili like bid?|pg||
nt|ady: not likely to play 4@H|pg||
nt|frankaus: have you heard my view on playing 5 minor contracts?|pg||
nt|ady: managed 3NY OR|pg||
nt|ady: OR|pg||
nt|h_karluk: esp when N showed his interest on unbid suits (the reds)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: sorry there were a huge misjudgement|pg||
nt|sybarra: might we try 3 @C now?|pg||
nt|pelu: ther5e are 8 "top" tricks - but not when u take @cK (see the 10) and run @cJ :(|pg||
nt|ady: must have got club position wrong in OR  to go so badly down in 3NT     low club and when 10 appeared went up with king and finessed 9|pg||
nt|pelu: 0,1 sec late, David :)|pg||
nt|ady: yes    you are too quick for me Peter|pg||
nt|haans: hearts right|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Spades are blocked but still only 8 tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Declarer's best chance is to duck at trick 1|pg||
nt|haans: wai'th with @CA|pg||
pc|s4|nt|szalay: if u travel across the World, better to agree 2suiter overcalls|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: the problem was the semi natural 1@c openingbid i think|pg||
nt|szalay: if a bid (semi)natural, better to treat it as natural, eg. to play (1m)-2m as Michaels vs. prepared 1m yet|pg||
nt|sybarra: likely to misguess hts here also |pg||
nt|h_karluk: obviously - east players happy with that 7 hcp|pg||
nt|yuval10: maybe too much for a 4-3-3-3 hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: 4@S cue|pg||
nt|szalay: I predict -1 and Hungary's win|pg||
nt|yuval10: this is the last board of the 10th round now|pg||
nt|chick: S is likely to get endplayed |pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: declarer didn't play for endplay but just claimed on 2 finesses|pg||
nt|yuval10: you can hardly endplay him|pg||
nt|daman: and thanks to BBO    without them we would not be able to watch this|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|szalay: but grand slam try with missing ace was a mistake, anyway|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: 1430, I guess|pg||
nt|xenya: admittedly, he does have a great hand|pg||
nt|szalay: nbo pressure for N-S now|pg||
nt|szalay: the real issue is 3m is nat or stopper asking|pg||
nt|haans: not to happy with @H lead|pg||
nt|ady: in what   4@H?|pg||
nt|haans: nt|pg||
nt|frankaus: its like kissing your own sister - even when its right ---- its hard to get excited about your prospects|pg||
nt|szalay: any bet?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Good defense now and we have a new leader:)|pg||
nt|szalay: every dutchman says: he will make it|pg||
nt|szalay: btw, this is the last board of set and last set for me|pg||
nt|szalay: thx all your patience, it was funny, anyway|pg||
nt|xenya: no defense, however good, will work if declarer gets @Hs right|pg||
nt|szalay: that is what bet about|pg||
nt|szalay: bt w to play safety @H in good direction is risky:|pg||
nt|szalay: he could lose 2 @Ds and a @H|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hi Vladimir:)|pg||
nt|szalay: so better to play for @H to king and small one, imho|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Rashed:)|pg||
nt|szalay: do u agree?|pg||
nt|xenya: thanks everyone|pg||
nt|po-s: why not|pg||
nt|chick: don't have to, it's automatic|pg||
nt|po-s: why would you need to - in 5H defenders helped a lot|pg||
nt|haans: sry|pg||
nt|sybarra: Thanks also to our specs who give us helpful comments and some humor! |pg||
pc|h2|nt|hawe45:  Is this result correct from =R - 10 tricks with two @H-losers and 3 potential trump-losers?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  From OR|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But still|pg||
nt|haans: they may still be relaying|pg||
nt|haans: ops|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: Lotan looked at me very disappointed|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if you are going to bid 4S, at least do it in tempo|pg||
pc|h5|nt|szalay: time for @S switch yet, and likely 2 off|pg||
nt|szalay: c u in 30 minutes|pg||
nt|szalay: byebye|pg||
nt|pelu: now 25-0 could be 25-24!|pg||
nt|haans: hung is trying to show his strength|pg||
nt|ady: yes Netherlands good comeback|pg||
nt|Walddk4: If he thinks he has that strong a hand, why did he not reverse into 2@H?|pg||
nt|ady: well the 2 club rebid did not exactly convey the hand|pg||
nt|haans: his opinion for a long time|pg||
nt|davidb: to leave the X . 3D  is ok for  juniors openings|pg||
nt|rnmalik: might play small from table to 9-safety play|pg||
nt|ritong: ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: like he bid like an old man|pg||
nt|marlowepi: or someone who was once an old man:)|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|h_karluk: thanks, you interpreted my feelings :)|pg||
nt|szalay: it will be push, thx all, c u soon|pg||
nt|h_karluk: thx buddy, c ya soon|pg||
nt|szalay: so from 52 cards 5@H is makeable now|pg||
nt|daman: the next session is scheduled for 12 minutes from now|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|haans: once again holy ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: a-ha North pushes his opps to game|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 4@C er helt ude i hampen|pg||
nt|frankaus: may escape  with -2|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: south asking west what double means|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: west doesnt have a real clue|pg||
nt|sybarra: how about "I think we can beat the contract"  as an answer|pg||
nt|Walddk4: And they can|pg||
nt|ritong: there is no reason to bid quickly, since west must pass 4@s no matter what|pg||
pc|h3|nt|xenya: but S preempted -- that may be a factor|pg||
pc|hT|nt|sharkey: Sac vs 3@H?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: there were a passed hand double and imho showed @h+@d|pg||
nt|pelu: the problem is that the X from = @H, so 2@h is what??|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Maybe that's too simple|pg||
nt|haans: we have said neither|pg||
nt|pelu: so play: X = dont lead @s|pg||
nt|Walddk4: but will they?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|xenya: this stands no chance of course -- let's see if he can get out for -1|pg||
nt|ady: high spade likely lead|pg||
nt|pelu: some play after opp has shown 2 suits, that a bid here is sopper and no stopper in the other suit|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hope they make postmortem especially about this board|pg||
nt|sybarra: ht lead spade thru?|pg||
nt|daman: sorry  22 minutes|pg||
nt|mcphee: wow|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|Walddk4: sorry for speaking Danish|pg||
nt|h_karluk: makeable now|pg||
nt|haans: small @D????????????????|pg||
nt|ady: win and duck a heart  will make|pg||
nt|ady: I think this may be down 1   so -200  will gain against 400 OR|pg||
nt|sybarra: or now,  of @S, H! switch,  spade thru?|pg||
nt|pelu: in S some play RD = I am not sure we sh play 3Nt and Pass = OK with me|pg||
nt|szalay: I just said: its not the percentage line|pg||
mc|10|nt|frankaus: bed time here back latter in day european time|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: yes this happened, north couldnt play south for 4@D|pg||
nt|xenya: i doubt that -- W's clubs are too small|pg||
nt|xenya: setting up @Ds would mean seetting up trump tricks for N|pg||
nt|sybarra: cu frank @H |pg||
nt|xenya: but i overlooked the fact that the defence had presented E with a trick -- now he certainly can make 11 and must be thinking how to get 12  |pg||
nt|sybarra: this doesnt look too tricky for declarer |pg||
nt|po-s: spade please|pg||
nt|mcphee: thanks all for watching|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: We'll be back with Netherlands Red - France 2|pg||
pg||
