nt|xenya: has to play it carefully though|pg||

mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Have to bid it...|pg||
mb|3S|nt|jni33: and no @h stopper :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Can't make on a club lead I think|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Please take notice, that MÃ¸ller did NOT double 3 @H - a service double, which gives the opponents more space|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Have to be careful not to duck the opening lead as the oppos can switch|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Why not Roland?|pg||
nt|xenya: on a @H lead, for example, she must win at once and play spades -- otherwise a @C shift will defeat it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Oh it can, if declarer rises|pg||
nt|hawe45:  9 sure tricks, playing on @S-suit|pg||
mb|p|pc|h2|nt|jni33: When did S have the opportunity to DBL 3@h ?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: @H2 is revealing. She knows hearts are 4-4|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Sorry... sleeping|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So might as well win|pg||
nt|vugraph814: Declarer must not hold up @hA|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Even if its ducked tough for South to find the club switch|pg||
nt|xenya: admittedly, the shift is not easy to find|pg||
nt|hawe45:  West should rise, take 4 @D-tricks and play @S from the right hand (in fact the LEFT hand)|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hJ|pc|hA|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sK|nt|hawe45:  As we know North he has 120 % sure a 4-card @H|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 1NT 12-14|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed - somewhat random, this, since a bunch of IMPs can go one way or another for no particularly good reason|pg||
nt|jni33: the EW pair bidding 6@s was Gitte Hecht and Margrethe Rykow  against Helle Rasmussen - Lone Bilde|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N!|nt|jni33: 3@s is 4card @s and minimum|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3NT serious I suspect|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|nt|paulhac:  Gitte does not like to miss slams:)|pg||
nt|jni33: 3nt = Strong @s and I do not have a single or a void|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N!|mb|p|nt|jni33: 4@c = cue|pg||
nt|dburn: 6@s pretty good contract - even if the spade finesse loses, you may be able to establish a third trick in hearts to pitch a losing diamond|pg||
nt|jni33: 4nt = 1430 RKCB|pg||
mb|5D|nt|paulhac:  Can they stay out of it? I do not think so|pg||

mb|p|mb|6S|nt|jni33: 4nt = 3 of 5 aces ... and exactly one cue in @d and @h|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I think they play Culbertson|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Exactly|pg||

nt|hawe45:  Tell East - discretely|pg||
nt|jni33: 5@s = I have told all I want you to know|pg||
