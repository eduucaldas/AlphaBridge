nt|wilkinsona: ...if diamond comes back....|pg||
nt|roswolf: a diamond looks best since it cuts communications|pg||

nt|roswolf: playing single dummy north has a very tough choice|pg||
nt|jcwla: friendly|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s8|pc|sA|nt|roswolf: but reducing communications is a good principle|pg||

nt|vugraphzdu: a direct 4@c would also show @c shortage and @s support, I don't know the difference|pg||
mb|d|mb|4D|nt|wilkinsona: it can be made on a diiferent line I perhaps just AK and another spades|pg||
