nt|haans: 1@C should have been alerted (2+)|pg||

nt|lml: there is an argument for 4|pg||

nt|rodal f: A hard hand at S but a normal ending to come.|pg||
nt|lml: with such extreme shape|pg||
nt|lml: lets see what east decides|pg||
nt|jwit: Some people play 4D as Namyats.  If that's the case, can't bid it|pg||
nt|lml: no then you usually open 3NT|pg||
nt|lml: a 4 level minor preempt|pg||
