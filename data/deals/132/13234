nt|Walddk2: possible results|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Peter Lund (pelu) is one of our regular commentators|pg||
nt|patricck: sounds like an interesting method|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He and Steen Møller are in the seniors' team|pg||
nt|szalay: the usual partscore start|pg||
nt|vugraph814: Larsen is a substitute for Blaksets normal partner, Jacob Røn|pg||
nt|patricck: yes, but plenty of ways the bidding might develop|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Lars Blakset (open team) has Thomas Vang Larsen as a substitute. Jacob Røn is not available|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|szalay: personally I wd double as West with unpassed pd, wd passed opposite passed pd|pg||

nt|szalay: it will be a touch-and-go contract|pg||

pc|s8|pc|s5|nt|szalay: no wd be crucial to remove @D entry to dummy|pg||

pc|h9|pc|s9|pg||
nt|Walddk2: For new specs. The pairs have 40 VPs each at the start of the match. Depending on results at the four tables, they can win up to 40 more, or lose all they have. 56-24, 72-8 and ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 45-35 are all possible results. Format is IMPs Across the Field. 4 tables|pg||

mb|2N!|nt|szalay: North probably will advance 2N (lebensohl) here, prelud to 3@C signoff|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|nt|patricck: yes... the 5-1 trump break will make that an unhappy contract|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|szalay: depends on w2 style, but I wd double it as West, IMPs|pg||
nt|jni33: hi all -- I'll try to keep you updated with scores from the other three tables |pg||

nt|Walddk2: *open team|pg||

nt|szalay: it will make now, no defence|pg||

nt|szalay: but North as well...no Smith signal there?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Even a low club would have worked|pg||
pc|h3|nt|szalay: smith signal: defender can show for declarer's lead that he likes or not the opening lead's suit|pg||
nt|szalay: some players play small is positive, others just opposite|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hT|pc|h8|pg||

nt|jni33: This board has been played at one other table allready -- at that table W played 3@d |pg||
nt|szalay: personally I like longer one|pg||
nt|jni33: and the result was 6 tricks|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|jni33: and 150 for NS|pg||
mb|1S|mb|d|nt|Walddk2: Terrible thought to have to rebid that club suit with no interference|pg||
nt|patricck: presumably NS play Strong NT, because if they play weak then 1NT is the better opening|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|szalay: "lead directors" prefer 1@D..and here is 1@C winning: it gives them chance to play @D|pg||

pc|d3|pc|d5|pc|d2|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|patricck: 4@H can't make in the abstract because NS would bid 4@S|pg||

pc|cK|pc|c4|pc|cT|pc|cQ|pg||

nt|vugraph814: Jan will explain|pg||
nt|patricck: Peter needs a new pair of glasses I think, 2nd time this set, at least there was a rational explanation for it all|pg||
nt|jni33: Declarer played @d 2 from dummy .. and played @h ace from hand |pg||

mc|9|nt|patricck: Double followed by 3@D would presumably be a stronger action than just overcalling 3@D. east might have been tempted to 3NT, but pass is probably the right bid|pg||

nt|patricck: probably a fairly close match, who do you think has won Roland?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Last board of the set now. Many thanks to Matias, great concentration!|pg||
nt|jni33: Seems like Lars Blakset has not got the right information|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and to my fellow commentators: Rashed, Patrick György and Jan|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe Lund did not alert his pass?|pg||
nt|jni33: Peter Lund has forgotten to alert his PASS to 2@d |pg||
nt|rnmalik: again in trouble our colleague:)|pg||
nt|szalay: strange things happen here|pg||
nt|patricck: what would East have bid with 3-3-4-3?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's definitely alertable if the agreement is that it shows diamonds|pg||
nt|jni33: and Lars might have bid if he was told that PASS showed @d .. TD has a busy day :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: yes, definitely alertable, and there may be damage, but not if east would have passed anyway. So what would he have bid if the pass was alerted?|pg||

nt|szalay: do u agree with DBL? I like it|pg||
nt|vugraph814: Lars claims that he would have bid 2@h, which would be doubled and partner would move to 3@c|pg||
