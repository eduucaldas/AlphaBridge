nt|baardolav: 3@c is non forcing... 5@c is not a bad contract, need the @c 3-3, like 3nt...|pg||

nt|marlowepi: yes, a very likely play in the club suit since W did all the bidding|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h9|pc|hK|pc|h3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he is planning to take club finesse|pg||

pc|cA|pc|cT|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|pc|c6|pc|c9|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it is clear to play ace of clubs on the bidding, the question is why not do it before the heart|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|pc|cJ|nt|marlowepi: when he led a heart toward dummy instead of starting on his die suit, which would be normal technique, it looked like he was planning to finesse clubs|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d6|nt|marlowepi: probably he was trying to slip a heart past first in case diamonds were 4-1|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d3|pc|dT|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|d7|mc|10|nt|marlowepi: he probably has to lose the lead twice, so if he can sneak the heart by he gains a tempo|pg||

mb|4H|nt|marlowepi: unlucky for 4H to fail, though the double is a warning about the spades. 5C a phantom that E is likely to bid|pg||

nt|marlowepi: anyway that is probably what he will play for|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i am not sure when it would be that W would play the spade queen|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if E did have 4 diamonds, this shift by E would be necessary to beat the contract|pg||

mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|marlowepi: that last swing was probably caused by the 2D bid, which allowed E to bid in leisurely fashion. a more space-consuming jump would have put a lot of pressure on E|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|baardolav: Need a double now...|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dJ|nt|marlowepi: 2S is 10-13? if a standard weak 2, it is a bad idea with two aces, especially at these colors. if N wants a swing, as he should, 1S would be just fine|pg||

nt|marlowepi: actually i would open 1S in any seat at any colors and any stage of match|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|sharkey: Eide's 2@S opening is a REAL weak 2 - compare with Svendsen's Muliti Vul 9xxxxxx..... a match or two ago|pg||
nt|sharkey: agree Marshall|pg||
nt|marlowepi: for me a "real" weak two does not have 2 aces, nor is it 64 in the majors|pg||
nt|baardolav: I belive Eide Houmøller playes a weak multi and 2@h 2@s is 8-11 or someting like that|pg||
