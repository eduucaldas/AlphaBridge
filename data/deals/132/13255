mb|3D|mb|3S|nt|geot: Tough bid 3@S, cost 500 even when pd has three card support and a singleton|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: it's possible that this is an rebiddable hand, 4@s cue is legal and not unreasonable|pg||
mb|5C|nt|geot: cant get more than five spade tricks and one ruff on best defence|pg||

pc|h4|nt|h_karluk: as i said when the opponents overcall, you should stretch your system rules to permit your side to stop easily when necessary. There are two reasons for this :|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 1-When the opponents overcall, your side loses one of it weapons 2- Also fewer opportunities for safe slam bidding|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Hauge bids every game and slam in sight. He is known as an aggressive bidder|pg||

nt|ralfwil: Play @cQ and let W help to find the right switch|pg||

nt|h_karluk: trying to be fair enough, 3N was an adventure, wdo|pg||
nt|geot: Wd E/W|pg||
nt|ralfwil: also @h7 had worked. N has to play @hK to make and a small for the same result|pg||
nt|geot: and I am not surprised, both classy players|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hehe , i believe big surgeons create big holes in body :)|pg||
nt|geot: But H!Q is better Ralf|pg||
nt|geot: East does not know the spades, and the setting tricks may be in hearts|pg||

nt|Walddk2: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rune_Hauge    Rune Hauge has been a somewhat controversial person, not so much at the bridge table. As a football (soccer) agent he has hit the front ...|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|nt|geot: When East opens, and most players do with this (me included), it is difficult to avoid bidding game|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If you open on a hand like that on E, you need to have good brakes too|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s9|nt|geot: And then again.....difficult to reach 3NT that makes|pg||

pc|s5|pc|s8|pc|sA|pc|sJ|pg||
