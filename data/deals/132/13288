mb|5S|mb|p|mb|5N|mb|p|mb|7C|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: A fast auction to the normal spot: South rebids her spades to show at least 5, North denies support|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: negative diamond lead looks best|pg||
nt|vugraphzxs: Good morning|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Indeed - seems to attack communications and wait for tricks in the other suits|pg||

nt|cuttysark: Spades lie quite well for declarer, who will probably look for tricks there|pg||

mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Swift auction to the gran slam -|pg||
pc|h8|nt|sharkey: View N has @SK) the spots are good enuff to pull trumps|pg||
nt|sharkey: @SK9|pg||
nt|jcwla: Looks like 4NT is the ask, 5@S shows two with the @CQ, 5NT shows the presence of all key cards, and 7@C is made with the side source of tricks.|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hJ|nt|ady: seems only realistic play is QX spades with east|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
mc|13|nt|cuttysark: She is unlucky in her finesses|pg||
nt|jcwla: 15 tricks at notrump, but at IMPs the most important thing is to get to the grand.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Indeed, if all the aces are present it is hard to imagaine a hand with no play for the Grand|pg||

nt|sharkey: 1 NT by E - may be final contract?|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|garnetts: true but there was a more obvious end play |pg||
nt|ady: 4@S an excellent game for e/w|pg||
mb|2D|nt|sharkey: dont think NS will enter into the fray VUL|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: not enamoured with the 2@C overcall prefer 1NT |pg||
nt|cuttysark: Looking at the NS hands, 4@H is pretty good - sinks on the 4-1 break|pg||
nt|ady: even with spade king offside can make if getting diamond position right|pg||
nt|garnetts: 4@H is unlucky to fail |pg||
mb|4S|nt|sharkey: S thinks otherwise|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  Players are getting more and more aggressive entering against strong 1N openers|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcwla: Nice 4@S bid here to help them avoid getting too high with W not holding any @S's.|pg||
pc|h9|nt|garnetts: well well !!!!!!!!!!|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 3@H is a Fit Jump - shows clubs as well as hearts|pg||
nt|sharkey: View S and E totally combine for 30 HCP+ S is lucky to catch this good a dummy|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Important to discuss the difference between 3@S and 4@S after a 2-level response|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ady: west came in late    will be pleased with dummy|pg||
pc|d5|nt|cuttysark: When opponents have a double fit.... so do you|pg||

nt|garnetts: South will think she has six spades maybe--|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Norths diamond lead must be a singleton |pg||
nt|cuttysark: (Easy for me to see, I guess, but why else lead dummy's suit?|pg||
nt|jcwla: I would take 3@S as setting trump and asking for control bidding.  A jump to game seems more of this type of hand: nothing but @S's but an opener rather than a preempt.|pg||

mb|p|nt|sharkey: Well, Reess team need IMPs so have to do something.  So far this worked out|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|sharkey: Misfits coing up...|pg||
nt|jcwla: Rebid 2@H or 2@S here?|pg||
mb|2C|mb|2H|mb|3C|mb|d|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: 5th highest lead clarifies the count in diamonds for everyone|pg||
nt|cuttysark: I prefer 2@H because that may be where we want to play - I would need better spades for 2@S|pg||
nt|jcwla: Yeah, the @S's look like five, don't they?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: some might have competed with 2@S with east hand   vulnerability may have beeb influential|pg||
mb|p|pc|sA|nt|cuttysark: I wonder what that double means - if penalty it is a big view|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sharkey: EW can make 5@D I think; have to work on @S suit - not @H.  3 NT easier....|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Hi all|pg||
nt|henryb:  E-W can make game, but only game in either red suit. I agree with Canonne that West is worth a reverse, but it may be hard to keep Clement from overreaching to slam|pg||
nt|sharkey: hi Hamdi|pg||
nt|sharkey: W forced to bid 3 NT now?|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|garnetts: a bit of a coffee hand now---maybe a lot of players would double 2@H with the East hand--I would have risked 2@S |pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|s9|nt|sharkey: After West's reverse 3@S must be forcing....|pg||
nt|sharkey: sry - East's 3@S|pg||
nt|henryb:  Clement obviously thought 3@s was forcing. Canonne thought she had done enough opposite a misfit|pg||
nt|sharkey: this may not make either....|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sJ|pc|sK|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d9|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
nt|jcwla: A common adage is not to double partscores into games at IMPs unless expecting a two-trick set - hard to see how E could have that level of confidence.|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pc|hA|nt|henryb:  I agree with Canonne, and think that Clement should make a more positive noise over 3@h|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|sharkey: @C and more @C will doom declarer|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h5|pc|h3|nt|cuttysark: Clear to compete in 4th seat - not so clear in the middle of a live auction when South could still be very strong|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h7|pc|h9|pc|hT|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|pc|cA|nt|henryb:  she after all has three diamonds for her partner's six card suit and @hAx for the five card suit|pg||
nt|h_karluk: there are two forms of reverse, normal and high, counting eleven in red suits with a minimum that's not close any of that. 2@d could be more reasonable rebid.|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|jcwla: The one thing you don't want to do on a board such as this is bring back -470.|pg||

nt|cuttysark: I guess there may be more action at the other table...|pg||
nt|ady: e/w should end in 4@H|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think that one should open 1@d, and that partner should make allowances for a high card stretch when opener shows 5-6|pg||
nt|sharkey: Levy lucky in CR - need @S lead to set this|pg||
mb|1D|nt|sharkey: set 4@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: 1@D-1@H-1@S-2@C (forcing)-2@D -- now E may take over and get them to the @D slam.  @H's also possible but less likely.|pg||
mb|1H|nt|h_karluk: 24/16 and interesting score on CR. Wait a minute please, Arent there 2x2 losers on M suits please?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|garnetts: This hand is everyones 4@H contract--a spread too|pg||
nt|sharkey: on Bd 2 where S ventured 2@S EW played 1 NT down 2 in CR; thus no gain from daring 2@S overcall|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|3D|nt|ady: play should be quick|pg||
nt|cuttysark: 2NT opener - possibly upgraded to 20 because of the good suit - makes it very easy to reach the easy game|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: West may decide to show her doubleton heart now|pg||
mb|3S|nt|sharkey: East on lead - @S lead not too attarctive...|pg||
nt|henryb:  At the other table East chpse to lead a club against 4@h and one of the spade losers was quickly thrown away|pg||
mb|p|mb|4C|nt|sharkey: Some may have raised on West's cards to ensure @S lead....|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|nt|ady: defenders will need to cash their 2 diamond tricks when in with A@H  or there will be an overtrick|pg||
mb|p|nt|cuttysark: Or not :)|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5H|nt|h_karluk: Say you stop in 3@h and your opps find killing @s lead, then you proud of yourself and smile about nice stop. However, once you reached the fat that impossible 4 made then you ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: think that's not fair. Sometimes good bidding punished while bad bidding rewarded|pg||
nt|jcwla: I like the 3@S -- knows they have a safe home in @D's and E may (and did) really want to hear about the @S card there.|pg||

nt|ady: good bid by west|pg||
nt|ady: this comes home with diamond finesse right|pg||
nt|jcwla: I wonder whether 3@H is invitational or forcing.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: The jump to 3@H is unusual nowadays - many play 2@H as forcing and 3@H as a splinter|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|cuttysark: Indeed - when partner doubles at her second shot there is a reason why she did not double first time - hand is flawed|pg||

mb|p|mb|2S|nt|sharkey: pros and cons for most conventions. you assumption you want the 11-12 HCP hand to take charge - by bidding 2 NT you let the other hand decide|pg||

mb|p|nt|cuttysark: I don't think our suggestions would get us any higher than the actual overcall :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: 4@S actually has real chances |pg||
mb|5C|nt|h_karluk: while minimum 23 is at our side why i am supposed to be in a hurry ?:)|pg||

nt|cuttysark: Another slam - though the heart break makes this one 'interesting'|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: Looks like a 0314 response and S will likely next ask for the @SQ with 5@D.|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|cuttysark: But when you bid a Moysian 4-3 they often break 5-1 or 6-0 - too much to handle :)|pg||

nt|garnetts: that is possible--haven't analysed it too closely--just looked as though it was not much wors that 4@C |pg||
nt|jcwla: With the hidden extras and only the @SQ missing among key cards, S takes a shot at slam - now to make it.|pg||

nt|marlowepi: l'echere 4C par Ouest aurait pu etre le choix heureux, mais le grand risque est vu ici. a part ca, 4C pourrait se faire contrer pour une penaltie non-miniscule.|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dA|pc|s7|pc|d4|pg||
nt|marlowepi: le vrai probleme avec 4C est ainsi: si le contrat peut reussir ce sera probablement grace a un fit trefe. mais en ce cas la les adversaires ont double fit aussi, et alors ils vont ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: probablement annoncer et resussir 4P. Plus sage de "laisser dormir les chiens endormis", comme on dit en anglais, et passer sur 3P qui probablement sera le contrat final|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: possible throw in|pg||

pc|c8|pc|c5|pg||

nt|h_karluk: thanks to our operator, kibbers and fellow commentators|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: The fact that you have 15 points opposite a 2@C opner usually means a grand but to their credit NS made it really hard in the CR--in the open room East could hace used RKCB |pg||

mb|p|mb|2C|nt|ady: e/w   likely to play 4@H|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|garnetts: presumebaly that shows 5-5 |pg||

nt|ady: thx David|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Bye David - and thank you|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 2C kind of cbs/nmf, 2H max with 3cm support|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: The temporizing 2@C will leave S glad not to be on opening lead.|pg||
nt|cuttysark: The great debate - to open 1NT with a 5card major or open the major, the never be able to show the right strength?|pg||
nt|cuttysark: They have 25 HCP, but not many tricks|pg||
pc|h3|nt|jcwla: Yeah, here E has really shown maybe a touch more than this to me; meanwhile, W glad to have been given a reprieve over 2@S to get to game.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Many would feel more comfortable about opening 1NT as E here by virtue of also holding three @H's.|pg||
pc|h8|nt|cuttysark: Mind you, that would still get them to 3NT|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jcwla: The idea is that with 2-5 in the majors, pd will get them to 2@H rather than 2@S.|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|h_karluk: N was very close to 1N|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but he had 14|pg||

pc|h4|pc|hJ|nt|ady: Levey got another 4 imps on hand 17   made 1NT   which was down 1 here|pg||
nt|cuttysark: Interesting - Levy gains 4 more imps on board 17 by playing a low club from dummy at trick one - West played the queen from Qx and 1NT now became easy|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h9|pg||

pc|s5|pc|h5|nt|cuttysark: This has become quite tricky now|pg||
pc|sA|nt|h_karluk: only @h Q favorably placed, so a H, a D, and 2C obvious losers|pg||
