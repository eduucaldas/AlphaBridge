nt|andyv:  after all, no one bid @ss yet.|pg||
nt|andyv:  then again, 1N by N could have been take out for other two suits|pg||

mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|athene: east knows that any missing cards (@DA, @CK) should be onside after the double|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: still it's not so easy to bid slam|pg||
nt|andyv:  a little less than 50% slam|pg||

mc|12|nt|april7: why doesn't he claim?|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps there was some confusion over when the auction became GF|pg||
nt|andyv:  W probably felt he did enough opening the hand, but 4@h over 3@h may have gotten them to slam|pg||
nt|athene: might be misunderstanding over fast arrival or somethin|pg||
nt|athene: (west thought 4@S showed extras and east thought it showed a minimum, for example)|pg||

nt|april7: sure|pg||
nt|april7: 3aces always|pg||
nt|andyv:  aces and spaces make this hand less valuable as an opener|pg||
nt|athene: maybe 1@C - 1@S; 1NT will end it|pg||
nt|april7: 1@C X 1@S 1NT|pg||
nt|athene: ah yes sorry east has a double|pg||
nt|athene: so EW will find diamonds|pg||
nt|april7: W might also bid 1NT|pg||
nt|athene: it's love-all so there should be fairly aggressive partscore competition|pg||

nt|athene: the issue here is whether the defence can make something of north's @D7, by club leads|pg||
