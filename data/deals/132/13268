nt|vugraphzpx: they were on the road but run out of gas somewhere...|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|josj: what's wrong with bidding 7 by N over 5NT?|pg||
nt|milton_se: opening 1S is heading for disaster|pg||
nt|josj: he is looking at considerable extra values|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: considering that N/S have been playing for 8 months i don´t really blame them :)|pg||
nt|josj: ah i c :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We are not blaming them|pg||
nt|haans: yes if he bids 6@H showing K = asking for K|pg||
pc|dA|nt|Walddk2: But it's a good idea to open your longer suit first|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 1@S response over 1@C is often 5 cards, at least in Europe where Walsh isn't particularly popular. Only with 4333 or 4xx4 will 1@S be less than 5 cards|pg||
