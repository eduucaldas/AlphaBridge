nt|szalay: doubt they will bid it|pg||
nt|chick: 3N unspecified splinter?|pg||
nt|szalay: hi all|pg||
nt|sybarra: S  was our operator in last match |pg||
nt|yuval10: W is Giampietro, Cristina|pg||
nt|daman: would we double with the South hand?|pg||
nt|haans: double?|pg||
nt|daman: or would we bid 2@C?    2@H?|pg||
nt|daman: pass is not an option|pg||
nt|haans: diamond will win|pg||
nt|chick: 2@H would be my choice|pg||
nt|haans: 2+ is alertable|pg||
nt|daman: it really doesn't matter because West will always compete in @Ds|pg||
nt|sybarra: gm Simon :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: Hello Simon|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: overbidding|pg||
nt|daman: 2@D must be a transfer|pg||
nt|chick: transfer advances?|pg||
nt|haans: if they make 1ntx they get 180|pg||
nt|daman: oui|pg||
nt|haans: :) Hi and Welcome :)|pg||
nt|haans: not all open clubs here|pg||
nt|haans: good passing|pg||
pc|h2|nt|rnmalik: there are chances for going overboard, funny hand first up|pg||
nt|szalay: hi all|pg||
nt|ady: n/s may get to game in no-trumps    likely to go down|pg||
nt|haans: yep |pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/index.php?option=com_frontpage&Itemid=76|pg||
nt|szalay: I suppose 2@H was both majors|pg||
nt|sybarra: you can find list of participants, and standings on that site|pg||
nt|szalay: btw its a bit strange North didnt open|pg||
nt|szalay: probably 4@D SPL is the best bid by West|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ady: will e/e  steal the contract    n/s can make a lucky 3NT  and make and make a safer contract in diamonds  10 tricks|pg||
pc|hA|nt|szalay: Israel play stad Israeli, I believe: strong NT, 5 card major, etc.|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: EW play natural, I think|pg||
nt|frankaus: not me  - 4 @S  would tempt me|pg||
nt|frankaus: then i'm a senior|pg||
nt|szalay: match starts with a boring 3N|pg||
nt|haans: doomed|pg||
nt|sybarra: and S has no further interest |pg||
nt|szalay: I dont suggest spl with 3 trumps only|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh, sorry,  S is brother of operator of last match |pg||
nt|chick: nor do I|pg||
nt|chick: E will leave that with his heart holding|pg||
nt|daman: West will balance|pg||
nt|haans: Hi Simon|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|VugraphPl1: http://michzimny.pl/bridge/2010/pila/gp.html|pg||
nt|ady: e/w can make 3NT    but hardly bidable|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=80&Itemid=72  for participants |pg||
nt|rnmalik: EW have 9 tricks as the cards are placed, agree.|pg||
nt|szalay: ok, u can drink coffee, he will make it|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I suggest - but do not support|pg||
nt|chick: many people like to play 1@S 4@H as natural hearts, so 3N gives a way to make a heart splinter|pg||
nt|chick: but in this hand, I would just bid a 2/1 2@D (or other game force)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  So would we all, I think|pg||
nt|haans: diamond will win|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ady: 2@H open room so will be a push|pg||
nt|hawe45:  2 NT checking for slam ambitions|pg||
nt|chick: imho, S is not strong enough for 2N|pg||
nt|haans: no stop there|pg||
nt|yuval10: T@s looks like the natural lead|pg||
nt|haans: many nowday bid 2nt invite or better|pg||
nt|yuval10: link for results : http://www.nbbportal.nl/1003/|pg||
nt|yuval10: click on "competitie"|pg||
nt|chick: W already neglected to bid @Ds, would be surprised to see him come in at the 3 level|pg||
pc|hK|nt|sybarra: do we have running scores Jacco?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: last time i saw Owen in Tri City (West Columbia) sectional, he is 21 y.o., educating in Economics branch in NC State College|pg||
nt|haans: clubs lead?|pg||
nt|haans: best|pg||
nt|ady: even on the lead will go down on a heart switch|pg||
nt|daman: uh oh|pg||
nt|haans: that double is new|pg||
pc|h8|nt|xenya: well EW can make 6@D|pg||
nt|szalay: but if u have singleton, better to show it yourself|pg||
nt|daman: it was OK for him to pass 2@D    he was going to get anpther chance to bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: EW lead 2/4|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|szalay: after given bidding best trump play (double hook) is even better|pg||
nt|xenya: hello again|pg||
nt|haans: opening 1@C was suicide here|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe should have ducked that one |pg||
nt|haans: did not like @C switch|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: he was afraid for @C's wasnt he?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|szalay: ok, u can try 6@D, but its terrible...long run I dont suggest slams with 30 hcp and 2 balanced hands|pg||
nt|szalay: bid your games, take your tricks (by Hamman) is good advice in any level|pg||
nt|sybarra: I take it this is the "slam try" sequence |pg||
nt|szalay: with aceless 11, with Qx @C I wd just say 3N, confess|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: I think east made a slamtry here, that is what i heard from the explanation from west|pg||
nt|szalay: a bit starnge 3@C rebid except its forcing (doubt it) with 9 top tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: nope it works now|pg||
nt|hawe45:  East and West doÂ´nt play the same system here|pg||
nt|haans: not in agrement here|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i would RD there onstead of 2@d, 2ndly i would definitely start with 1@h|pg||
nt|haans: 2@D show support|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|ady: west should know on the 2 lead that north has 5 clubs|pg||
nt|haans: whappen happened her|pg||
nt|frankaus: 15 2 H in pd major - pd opens - how many will stay short of game?|pg||
nt|haans: non vul yes |pg||
nt|haans: you need 50% to bid game|pg||
nt|h_karluk: my sys card is 2/1 - so it's impossible to stop before game with EW hands|pg||
nt|szalay: and ART asking bid w/o shortness|pg||
nt|daman: the axe might be unsheathed again|pg||
nt|daman: but maybe not|pg||
nt|daman: 3@C was very risky given North only promises 2|pg||
nt|chick: true, but ... he is better getting in his one bid at the first chance and then stay very quiet|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: So the names will be up soon again|pg||
pc|d3|nt|szalay: if it was slamtry, West wd accept for sure|pg||
nt|h_karluk: he and his mother Miss Anita are BBO players|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Yuval Yener|pg||
nt|yuval10: hi all|pg||
nt|haans: mirrow hands not thye best|pg||

pc|d5|nt|szalay: we will see trump play|pg||
nt|Walddk4: West is Giampetro|pg||
nt|daman: down 2 |pg||
nt|haans: 2 down|pg||
nt|copeyj: Many people after (1@C)-X-(1M) play X as showing 4 and bid 2M with 5, but obviously not Bessis/Volcker|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|sybarra: costs nothing to put up the q |pg||
nt|szalay: as u probably know: u must leas Q first|pg||
nt|yuval10: Operator can you please insert W's name?  |pg||
pc|hT|nt|haans: flat board|pg||
nt|ady: cash to clubs puts pressure on west   has to discard a heart   but still down 1|pg||
nt|haans: are they playing Magic Diamond?|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: seems like a crossruff will come to 11 tricks fairly easily|pg||
pc|h5|nt|szalay: French pair won Bonn Open Teams (Nations Cup) last year|pg||
nt|haans: lucky bidding :)|pg||
pc|h7|nt|ady: would expect 130 to be flat    but you never know|pg||
nt|haans: many play x as take out|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|szalay: personally I wd open West as 2N, if it starts at 20...7 controls, 4 tricks|pg||
nt|haans: i would sday just cards|pg||
pc|h4|nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||

nt|vugraphzeg: I dont see them yet. Red vs Blue was 22-8|pg||
pc|c5|nt|szalay: cause u can gain JTxx in South, but not in North|pg||
nt|szalay: lead|pg||
nt|daman: by passng and then doubling West was able to show his shape|pg||
nt|daman: which is helpful|pg||
mc|8|nt|ady: force dummy with heart now|pg||

nt|ady: J@C   big card in west hand   e/w can make 3NT|pg||
nt|ady: danger of 1@C being passed out|pg||
nt|szalay: I think 1@C is not an option|pg||
nt|sybarra: and stiff A of @C makes the hand easy|pg||
nt|szalay: either 2N or (semi)forcing 2@C/@D|pg||

mb|p|nt|haans: Ms Ormay opening|pg||
nt|copeyj: I wonder what Nab will open|pg||
nt|Walddk4: As long as she is not amiss|pg||
nt|copeyj: I am sure some people would choose 1NT especially 3rd seat nv|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: if u go to normal games: go as fast as u can...dont give them chance to interfere|pg||
nt|sybarra: probably a preemptive @D raise coming |pg||
nt|szalay: why not 4@H with passed pd?|pg||
nt|frankaus: Ax no the best stopper in the world often better played from Qx side|pg||
nt|szalay: slam is unlikely, @H are good, so?|pg||
nt|sybarra: but unlikely to keep e/w out of 4 @H |pg||
nt|sybarra: you had the one with the picture |pg||
nt|sharkey: appears 4@S can be made - however, may have transportation problems|pg||
nt|ady: part score hand    n/s may be able to stop in 2@D|pg||
nt|chick: with all their controls, can EW stay out of the @D slam?|pg||
nt|szalay: good 4@Hs fails, worse 3N COULD be make (for @H lead)|pg||
nt|xenya: i would be content with just 1@S|pg||
nt|haans: ms|pg||
nt|copeyj: there we go|pg||
nt|copeyj: Some pairs play X of a strong NT as artificial, including myself. But when the opps have opened 1N 3rd seat nv I play penalty doubles|pg||
nt|copeyj: Would be useful here to have a penalty double available|pg||
mb|1C!|an|2+!C|nt|sybarra: the website|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like 12 tricks for me....previous hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Peter |pg||
nt|szalay: it was 11-14 NT|pg||
nt|daman: another partscore?   EW have the potential for a lot of tricks in @Cs|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: looks like a 30 point deck to E |pg||
nt|h_karluk: so far EW 5@c-1 and NS 4@s -1|pg||
nt|szalay: pass with 4 hcp (including a King) very dangerous|pg||
nt|ady: even 2NT opening did not get them to game|pg||
nt|sybarra: can S venture a bid,  yes he does|pg||
nt|sybarra: n/s may push them a bit here|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I only bid 2 @H here with a @h-suit...|pg||
nt|chick: you think S's suit is too weak?|pg||
nt|yuval10: i would've pass from E, to be honest|pg||
nt|haans: nothing perfect|pg||

nt|vugraphzeg: yes but that is a blog|pg||
nt|ady: n/s likely to play 2@H|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i would even not try it|pg||
nt|sharkey: Standings after 2 rounds: http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=85&Itemid=79|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: after 3 rounds actuallly|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but i would rebid 1N as West|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 3@c wouldn't be much fun to play|pg||
nt|copeyj: Double is probably artificial it has been alerted|pg||
nt|copeyj: Bessis will be pleasantly surprised by his partner's choice of suit|pg||
nt|copeyj: note E/W can get out for 300 in 5@CX|pg||
nt|copeyj: and even 6@CX is a profitable save against 11 tricks in @S|pg||
mb|1N!|an|15-17|nt|h_karluk: interesting 1NT|pg||
nt|szalay: in junior/female tourney I think to play weak nt 2/1 is an advantage|pg||
nt|haans: and a make :)|pg||
nt|haans: and then ...|pg||
nt|haans: good pass by south|pg||
nt|Walddk4: If LC had been here, he would call 3@S an anti-Law bid|pg||
nt|haans: 1st time ive seen walsh trf here|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: 4@s is some bid by N, P has a very good support though|pg||
nt|yuval10: and now probably bid 5@s ?|pg||
nt|sharkey: Gembick's pass??|pg||
nt|haans: 1n bye North?|pg||
nt|haans: nopåe|pg||
nt|haans: not a nice bid when vul|pg||
nt|sharkey: They've landed in their best strain|pg||
nt|ady: north 2@D rebid very respectable|pg||
nt|sybarra: dout you get killed at the 2 level,  I would bid  ...sort of only chance|pg||
nt|sybarra: *doubt |pg||
nt|chick: should make this|pg||
nt|haans: dirty hand for 4@S but best choice|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: ir 2 @C all pass |pg||
nt|haans: 2@D must be 6-carder|pg||
nt|ady: unfortunately may well go down |pg||
nt|pelu: I would open 2NT (20-21) - over 1@C - 1X I bid 3MT = 15-18 with long @C|pg||
nt|daman: 5@C was aggressive|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: why not double by South?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 2254 and 15|pg||
nt|hawe45:  By several levels too weak - and only @C-lead defeats 6 @D|pg||
nt|szalay: its not true Open highest level|pg||
nt|yuval10: i think it's makeable in any way, via @c finesse|pg||
nt|haans: if opps do not play @H raise @D|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ady: best spot for n/s is clubs  but unable to get there|pg||
nt|sybarra: a @h lead might not be so pleasant |pg||
nt|ady: may well be a swing for Netherlands|pg||
nt|szalay: in 4N|pg||
nt|haans: and clubs honors right|pg||
nt|sybarra: works on this hand |pg||
nt|sybarra: (maybe)|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: if you play strong 1N i|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: you probably will play there|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|frankaus: traffic light is red pays to be conservative|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh well what do I know |pg||
nt|haans: 4@H young bidding|pg||
nt|h_karluk: this time black Kings are not favorably placed|pg||
nt|daman: opposite a passed hand|pg||
pc|hK|nt|szalay: e-w gave them all the chance|pg||
nt|xenya: they might get to a hopeless slam now -- and they did|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 @S?  rkk ? |pg||
nt|szalay: u can beat 5@C if u play some special (lavinthal, roman) signal over A of @S|pg||
nt|haans: E dont fool me|pg||
nt|szalay: some specs asked why|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 5@D is makeable, this contract looks unlucky|pg||
nt|szalay: I think cause at Open this kinda toy isnt so dangerous|pg||
nt|szalay: in junior/female tourney 80% or more of the field unfamiliar with weak NT sys|pg||
nt|szalay: I think no pair in the World who wd play 5-3 minor-suit game instead of 5-3 major|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true |pg||
nt|daman: who simply raised|pg||
nt|haans: they have clubs you have points so play clubs|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|szalay: I think first step to trap was 1@H...after that they came deeper and deeper|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: seemed like a cuebid auction to me|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/index.php?option=com_frontpage&Itemid=76|pg||
nt|sybarra: this site has a picture of the beautiful facility at the White House |pg||
nt|yuval10: will make 11 now|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sybarra: it is a reburbished tennis club,  (still active tennis courts)  and a wonder bridge facility |pg||
nt|chick: no club finesse necessary |pg||
nt|haans: but bid but|pg||
nt|haans: big|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ady: yes agree should be 6 card suit  but AQ to 6 and 2 outside aces is top weight|pg||
nt|daman: I don't think there are 11 tricks|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|szalay: or by accident, only|pg||
nt|chick: :)|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|sybarra: and they are playing with screens |pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/index.php?option=com_content&task=blogcategory&id=31&Itemid=78   standing after round 1|pg||
nt|sybarra: long way to go |pg||
nt|frankaus: can get it home on this lead|pg||
nt|h_karluk: honestly i would bid 4@d as West|pg||
nt|yuval10: the lead was one more good reason for not opening 1@h with such a poor suit |pg||
nt|haans: if only 1@S overcall is not game harder to find?|pg||
nt|xenya: i agree|pg||
nt|xenya: nice lead -- tough for declarer now as entries to dummy are scarce|pg||
pc|hA|nt|rnmalik: @D back|pg||
nt|ady: defence should prevail |pg||
pc|h6|pc|h7|nt|haans: better late than never|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 3@s is definitely an agressive bid... I am not a fan|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|ady: spade lay out bad for declarer|pg||
nt|haans: @H" = hearts 4-4|pg||
pc|h9|nt|rnmalik: the bidding sequence enabled EW to find the defence to 2@H|pg||
nt|haans: clubs ruff?|pg||
nt|frankaus: not easy to switch to 1S|pg||
nt|frankaus: @S|pg||
nt|xenya: i meant about the 1@H opening|pg||
nt|haans: 2|pg||
pc|c2|nt|szalay: 2@D was NOT xfer, was gameforcing stayman|pg||
nt|szalay: 3@D had shown a normal 6card or very good 5card suit|pg||
pc|hT|pc|s8|pg||
nt|ady: cant see any other bidding possible|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am not so sure why N bid over 2 @C |pg||
nt|sybarra: where was he going?|pg||
nt|ady: this might be down 3|pg||
nt|ady: 9 tricks on any lead|pg||
nt|haans: very few have methods for a prempts after 1nt opening|pg||
pc|c5|nt|frankaus: WD|pg||
nt|h_karluk: also not hard with @s T9 etc|pg||
nt|szalay: I confess I wd bid 3N directly over that|pg||
nt|copeyj: ah sorry 5@CX is 500|pg||
nt|copeyj: thanks kibs :)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|haans: best defense|pg||
pc|c9|nt|animeshraj: a low h now!  and h q frm west|pg||

nt|Walddk4: All results (including butlers and hand records) on www.nbbportal.nl/1003/ > 'competitie'|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh well |pg||
pc|d6|pc|d5|nt|szalay: and my fate is in West's hand|pg||
pc|dA|nt|h_karluk: @d9 was indeed a slip in defense - either @hJ or small @c would work better|pg||
nt|szalay: always tough to decide between strong 4card or weaker 5card suit to lead vs. 3N|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|nt|xenya: if E has @CA and a spade honour, slam is quite good -- perhaps too much to ask for? |pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: declarer claims @D7, but some debate whether it counts when @D is trump suit :)|pg||
nt|daman: down 1|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dT|pg||
nt|haans: ruff|pg||
pc|dK|nt|h_karluk: well i didn't get it, sorry, why i am supposed to play 5/2 @s fit? maybe there's still a 5/4 @d fit, so i liked 1NT rebid - just keeps bidding open, i don't think promises a rose ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: garden :)|pg||
nt|pelu: Decl: better play @D first - the @h-suit was locked for defense|pg||
nt|haans: endplay small @D to decl|pg||
pc|s2|pc|d8|nt|ady: sorry did not see 2@C bid   but was presumably a transfer to 2@D |pg||

pc|sA|nt|ady: this route showed a minimum hand with 5 spades and 4 hearts is what I think|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: nope south showed 15-17, actually they play my methods here|pg||

mb|3C|mb|p|nt|petergill: Part of the reason the defence went wrong was that North thought South had 5 spades for the 1@S bid|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Identical bidding as was in CR and |pg||
nt|rnmalik: so far|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@H 4th suit forcing|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|yuval10: 3@d from S could've been an option too|pg||
pc|h3|nt|petergill: South is concerned that his heart stopper will not last long, but he has little choice (3@D?) but to bid 3NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Argelazi reluctant to bid 3NT perhaps as partner could be 2-1-5-5. 3@H as a repeated 4th suit would not be a silly bid|pg||
nt|petergill: or even 3@D?|pg||
nt|davidb: very friendly  cards layout for NS|pg||

nt|petergill: "When in doubt, bid 3NT." If you look up various hands form the Australian Trials today, you will find at least one hand where the only pairs to try 3NT (instead of 4@S or 5@D) ...|pg||
nt|petergill: were the pairs who ran 1st and 2nd |pg||
nt|yuval10: but then 3 rounds of @s and dummy is squeezed|pg||
nt|rnmalik: no more friendly after Q@C and cover|pg||
nt|petergill: Ducking can gain if clubs are 3-3|pg||
nt|petergill: but can lose if West has HHxx in spades|pg||
nt|yuval10: you'll have to guess over 3 rounds of @s which minor to discard from dummy|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c2|pg||
nt|petergill: Yuval's point makes it best to take @CA, I think|pg||
nt|davidb: needs perfect defense now |pg||
nt|petergill: West knows a heart is fatal, so should try a spade, perhaps the ten, perhaps the 3|pg||
nt|petergill: If the ten, East might switch to hearts, solving the "discarding from dummy" problem|pg||

nt|szalay: btw Woolsey's policy is correct imho: if u have 5card suit: lead it, otherwise try to figure out pd's 5card|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: nice defense... 3@s got what it deserved|pg||
mb|1D|nt|yuval10: NS will make a lot of tricks here|pg||

mb|p|nt|xenya: but E did bid 5@C -- seems that's what W was eager to hear|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|nt|sharkey: a + score is good here|pg||

nt|yuval10: looks like an easy game for EW here|pg||

mb|2C|nt|sybarra: http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/index.php?option=com_frontpage&Itemid=76  actually think this one is easier using left hand index |pg||
nt|haans: that overcall vul is WEAK|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: I think a tipical mistake to correct in junior age by coach(es): stop slam-greedy|pg||
nt|sybarra: they keep skipping the @S suit, but it is 4333   |pg||
nt|szalay: the imp score is done for GAMES, from both directions|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 21/19 and North lonely cowboy now|pg||
nt|pelu: for me 1NT or 2Nt!|pg||
nt|haans: agree|pg||
nt|ady: would have tht 1NT better from north|pg||
nt|haans: 2@C not forcing|pg||
nt|szalay: that is the reason why in Hungary we tend NOT to lead 4card suit vs. 3N, rather "odd card major"|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: we'll see how low everyone can stay on this board... 3@c and 2M look to be the limits|pg||
nt|haans: that michaes not my cup|pg||
nt|xenya: N got somewhat greedy when he played a small diamond, allowing contract to make, in theory, and that resulted in 2 down  |pg||
nt|copeyj: N/S can make 3NT here I think - but Volcker decided to take his shot at defending|pg||
nt|marlowepi: a  lucky 3N|pg||
nt|sybarra: and an ugly on at that |pg||
mb|2H!|nt|h_karluk: and whichever suit you pick things not much easy |pg||

mb|p|nt|h_karluk: 2@c now cbs- i suppose|pg||
nt|sharkey: NS past their comfort zone |pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: South explained when asked that 3@c shows a good hand|pg||
nt|sharkey: I like 1 NT instead of 3@C|pg||
nt|pelu: sh for sure be a 5 card suit|pg||
nt|frankaus: 4@D will make life difficult|pg||
nt|haans: not easy|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think experienced players would thank to 4@d overcall that alarmed about there's a highly distributional layout|pg||
nt|haans: agree|pg||
nt|haans: but what to lead|pg||
nt|frankaus: i like X here - (t/o) do something sensible |pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/index.php?option=com_frontpage&Itemid=76|pg||

nt|sybarra: mine is participants I see |pg||

nt|h_karluk: Nort has just 5 losers, however no entry to table|pg||
nt|ady: get clubposition will  make life easy|pg||
nt|sybarra: website,  on left you can go to participants, scores etc  |pg||
nt|chick: 2N = unusual (minors in this case), but sacrificing VUL is usually dangerous, and E doesn't have enough for 4@C imo|pg||
nt|chick: and W is sucked in by E's bid to a very risky save|pg||
nt|hawe45:  West is socked in by his own 2 NT-bid - lacking 2-3 key-cards vulnerable|pg||
nt|hawe45:  sucked|pg||
nt|haans: @C) good|pg||
nt|haans: 9|pg||
nt|daman: what is their carding?|pg||
nt|haans: making it easy|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 3N is also making I suppose|pg||
nt|haans: nice|pg||
nt|xenya: it does -- on a @D finesse|pg||
mb|3N|nt|szalay: e-w has their 3rd dangerous bidding so far|pg||
nt|haans: i play 3@C as a prempt|pg||
nt|haans: many beginners believe all new suit bids are forcing even when reponers first say = have weak hand|pg||
nt|ady: diamond back best for now|pg||
nt|haans: standard for 2nt bid to be forcing nowdays|pg||
nt|daman: a spec says udca|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: put me down as a pass with Wests hand - aceless 4333 even with 14 i would pass|pg||
nt|szalay: double by South?|pg||
nt|ady: 2 spades and a club it seems|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i play as jump rebid|pg||
nt|haans: clubsa clubs and more clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: and maybe that was a good reason to begin with a convention - the F******y|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Even green against red it is doubtful|pg||
nt|haans: some very young some not more than 25|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: welcoms Szalay |pg||
nt|ady: needs to cash club now|pg||
nt|szalay: normal bidding, normal contract, easy make|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 2@h also works - natural|pg||
nt|yuval10: with some overtricks|pg||
nt|pelu: Howard 8Australia) after same start bid 1Nt in N|pg||
nt|szalay: Brigitta became a bit pessimistic abroad|pg||
nt|szalay: so here @S lead for us...the best one|pg||
nt|szalay: @D fulfills it|pg||
nt|szalay: as bridgeplayer I wd like to watch @S lerad...as Hungarian @D:)|pg||
nt|szalay: lead|pg||
nt|daman: that was not a great switch|pg||
nt|haans: @C) = lavinthal|pg||
nt|haans: 9|pg||
nt|po-s: A bit lucky - to find South with the two minor queens|pg||
nt|haans: @h neutral so best|pg||
pc|hT|nt|sybarra: Jacco's first web site, you can see the beautiful facility |pg||
nt|szalay: he has 2 aces, pd had shown values, they bypassed 3n...SO|pg||
nt|rnmalik: good lead|pg||
nt|szalay: odd card major, u know:)|pg||
nt|szalay: but are few exceptions what I dont tell u know...we need some secret weapons:)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: so is @H in E:)|pg||
nt|szalay: unbid oddcard major, to be specific|pg||
nt|rnmalik: ok|pg||
nt|yuval10: red suit lead will give declarer his 9th trick, not that he can't develope one in @s anyway...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: interestingly, in 3N you want the club king onside, but in 5D you want the opening leader to have it:)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|haans: with 4-2 draw trumfs and play nt|pg||
nt|chick: as a kib points out, E may want to double 4@S as well|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: quite the aggresive type of lady..|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|vugraphzeg: I made the classic mistake 4 and A|pg||

nt|ady: hi|pg||

nt|rnmalik: hi and welcome|pg||
nt|haans: have x for mopre cards|pg||
nt|pelu: nu lead can defeat 3Nt - 3!X then u set up 3 @D-tricks = 9|pg||
nt|ady: with hearts 4-4  heart lead would not beat the contract  defence take 3 hearts and 1 diamond|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Facing a vulnerable 2 NT, East can only see 3 losers|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|h_karluk: depends agreements just use 2@d or 2@h, and make things easier|pg||
nt|szalay: btw @H beats it as well|pg||
nt|rnmalik: It makes only on @D lead|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I mean as the cards are|pg||
nt|szalay: Hope can lead @S back, cause sure partner has T: otherwise declarer wd play small from dummy, probably|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: Hop asking questions about possible distribution|pg||
nt|szalay: some spec suggested @C lead is ok as well: to be honest I dont lead opps suit from Txx...NEVER|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: of declarer's hand|pg||
nt|szalay: declerer could have 4card @S|pg||
nt|szalay: his bid just denies 4card @H|pg||
nt|haans: now can raise hearts|pg||
nt|haans: no sry|pg||
pc|dA|nt|szalay: to bid games, take tricks...and double games when they r in vuln and we see the chance|pg||
nt|sybarra: it is a reburbished tennis club (still active tennis courts) and quite a terrific bridge facility also |pg||
nt|haans: many  mean 3n to show two cards in opening suit|pg||
nt|yuval10: now only @h will limit declarer to 10|pg||
nt|daman: tempo is everything|pg||
pc|d8|nt|h_karluk: 11-15 5@h+4@s stuff|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: made a mistake when correcting the first score|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: was 1 off|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: dummy is getting tapped, and this should be down one too many I believe|pg||
pc|d4|nt|yuval10: otherwise 12 tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like that, yes|pg||
nt|xenya: but this seems to give declarer a break|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|ady: this not definately making from south's point of view|pg||
nt|ady: if south plays K@H now then will be much better placed|pg||
nt|szalay: do u see any reason for small @D?|pg||
nt|szalay: except blocking suit?|pg||
nt|szalay: and to give fals impression to pd?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  West might refret the small @D - but we do not know their methods|pg||
nt|szalay: I am informed Hungarian defender started @S as well|pg||
nt|szalay: he learnt his lesson well, wd:)|pg||
nt|szalay: I believe to lead small from Qx is technically bad|pg||
nt|szalay: when dummy has 76xx|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I agree adds to confusion for the P|pg||
nt|szalay: small @D back wd be a punishment...|pg||
nt|szalay: but:|pg||
nt|szalay: who has J of @S?|pg||
nt|szalay: surely West|pg||
nt|szalay: otherwise declarer wd play small, not Q|pg||
nt|szalay: at trick 1|pg||
nt|szalay: so @S is a 100% lead|pg||
nt|haans: back to teaching|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|h_karluk: everything is on the right spot for NS|pg||
nt|haans: we have all seen better defense|pg||
pc|dT|nt|szalay: I was there..in February..I remember was terrible cold and windy|pg||
nt|haans: say ty opps|pg||
nt|ady: but east can get 2 spade ruffs|pg||
nt|pelu: yes: @Sk - @s ruff - @c to A and @S ruff|pg||
nt|haans: to strong for flannery|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ady: K@S   spade ruff   then trump back and another spade ruff|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|daman: the @C 9  and @D 6 seem to be suit preference for @Ss :)|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|nt|h_karluk: maybe the software allows you to correct it anytime, i think Roland is good at that|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: could S maybe chuck the Q@C on the king?|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: needs partner to have all the intermediate clubs though|pg||
pc|cA|nt|h_karluk: to me ideal F-----y|pg||
nt|sybarra: should be fairly certain now that spdes are 3/3|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|ady: now making 11|pg||
nt|rnmalik: as the cards we see +1 now|pg||
nt|h_karluk: because the hand does not contain reverse values|pg||
nt|chick: well, they may get out for down only 1|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|nt|ady: sorry  Peter you were first|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: Bas van Beijsterveldt helped me :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: congrats :)|pg||
nt|haans: Hi Erwin|pg||
nt|frankaus: will make 12 i expect|pg||
nt|haans: decl do not know how to play @H|pg||
nt|po-s: North should have a pretty good club suit after his spade bid|pg||
nt|xenya: yes -- and N gets another chance|pg||
pc|h5|nt|vugraphzeg: claimed too early|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: quite messy at the table |pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
pc|d7|pc|s7|nt|pelu: normal u dont give distribution i trumf, but here it would help W if he know that pd has even No|pg||
pc|s2|pc|c5|pg||
pc|d9|nt|sybarra: easy now |pg||
nt|hawe45:  West should know, that when declarer plays @S Queen from dummy, East PROBABLY has the 10!|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s4|pc|s3|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|h_karluk: enters to table with a @c - pitches 2 @h loser, that's al folks|pg||
pc|c6|nt|szalay: Israel is slow starter: they missed a so-so slam after agressive slamtry, bid a (nearly) hopeless one...and bid terrible game, where only good news it wasnt double|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: http://www.vkblog.nl/blog/3052/Bridgenieuws some impressions from the pro am yesterday. Esp interesting for the dutch viewers|pg||

nt|h_karluk: esp when u r a passed hand|pg||
nt|yuval10: indeed, 2@c is invitational |pg||
nt|h_karluk: i agree with 3@c rebid, invite or better, i can live with that 5 losers, no matter entry to table, i know no need to cry when they sets, favorable vuln was another tempting factor|pg||
nt|haans: right u r|pg||
nt|haans: not bad|pg||
nt|pelu: west has a 5 loser-hand - and his pd has 0 tricks for him! :(|pg||
nt|szalay: rehi|pg||
nt|ady: west may open some sort of weak 2|pg||
nt|daman: they should gain at least 3 IMPs    800 was there for the taking|pg||
nt|haans: @C9 acceptable of play low enc|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: so George, which contract will we end up (doubled) in now?|pg||
nt|daman: @D Ace was fatal|pg||
nt|daman: hhrrrmmmm|pg||

nt|haans: all the way|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: Bessis is laughing about the pass of his partner|pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry meant 3/2,  obviously early in morning for me |pg||
nt|haans: easy make :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: commentators curse strikes immediatly:(|pg||
nt|ady: re|pg||
nt|szalay: but East knew J of @S for sure|pg||
nt|haans: 4@H?|pg||
nt|daman: no doubled contracts this time|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: if he wasn't passed hand then 2@d would've been GF|pg||
mb|2C|an|GF|nt|szalay: in that case I wd go out for water, to refresh myself|pg||
nt|ady: an easy 3NT  played by south|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes|pg||
nt|sharkey: E has the "perfect" Dbl hand|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 23-17 this time, another interesting board|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: they even played after the claim..|pg||
nt|szalay: Frenchmen are very conservative with 4card other major|pg||
nt|ady: at least 10 tricks in hearts for e/w|pg||
nt|ady: west decided not to open|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Also, yes|pg||
nt|szalay: logic is more important than defence agreements|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: 4@s?|pg||
nt|daman: I might have to eat my words :)|pg||
nt|daman: yes|pg||
nt|haans: yes full standard|pg||
nt|sybarra: great slam here |pg||
nt|haans: good 3@H|pg||
mb|3H|nt|rnmalik: can they make 6@D|pg||
mb|p|an|*|nt|h_karluk: uh oh. 1@s ? hmmm :)|pg||
nt|pelu: his problem was the 4 card @s|pg||
nt|ady: west wasting no time  4@D  is for hearts|pg||
nt|szalay: I agree with xfer to 4@H: IF we have weak 6card and strong 4card major, kinda stayman is preferred|pg||
nt|szalay: in Hungary we had a 1st class teacher/player in 60s, called Lajos Widder|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 2NT in N for minor|pg||
nt|szalay: his favourite proverb was: "I hate maths...only important thing is: all players has 13 cards and all color has 13"|pg||
nt|daman: I must admit    I would have bid 2@H with the West hand|pg||
nt|haans: both makes|pg||
nt|daman: 1@S seemed timid|pg||
nt|chick: too strong for Michaels|pg||
nt|daman: no way|pg||
nt|chick: 1@S, then 2@D shows the hand much better|pg||
nt|haans: best is 5@H now|pg||
nt|daman: classic Michaels|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: 3 NT|pg||
nt|copeyj: great grand|pg||
nt|haans: many play X showing minimum|pg||
mb|3S|nt|szalay: terrible slam, imho|pg||
nt|rnmalik: a @C can be pitched on @S but they dont know:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: likely to play 2 @H's here|pg||
nt|szalay: in Hungary we play Michaels a bit different way than World do|pg||
nt|szalay: NOT weak or strong, rather "at least inv values, no upper limit"|pg||
nt|haans: gazzilli|pg||
nt|haans: anything but 2@D is weak|pg||
nt|sybarra: a grand even but is it biddable  (7 @D?)|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: dont they play Drury?|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: During the white house juniors very nice weather last few years|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: Dennis Bilde had his moment on the first board. now 1 highpoint average over 3|pg||
nt|haans: best game 3nt but ...|pg||
nt|szalay: Lazar could NOT bid 3@D as P/C, cause its inv with @S|pg||
mb|4S|nt|frankaus: water? - do u know what fish do in water :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: those hands are usually easy to bid :)|pg||
nt|ady: natural    should have had a 5th club|pg||
nt|haans: no way to show @D :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: how about pass :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: he already had 3@c in his hand..|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: practically|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Yes - E/W need a quiet board|pg||
nt|szalay: I think South's hand is close to 2N, imho|pg||
nt|daman: hard to bid 2@D over 3@H|pg||
nt|chick: Michaels is a preemptive bid, he does not need to preempt|pg||
nt|haans: 3@H usually no defensive tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: so 3@D is natural and weak?|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: yes|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 2@s would show a non-constructive raise I suppose, so he has to bid 3@d. N can now bid 4@h which will be corrected to 4@s and that should be the final contract|pg||
nt|haans: yep 2@D is GF|pg||
nt|haans: if p is strong|pg||
nt|haans: any bid now strong hand|pg||
nt|copeyj: 7NT on ice - and they will bid it no problem|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes 7 mnt also |pg||
nt|copeyj: when south gets to ask for aces|pg||
nt|haans: rkc show @DQ and off|pg||
nt|marlowepi: generally disappointing to be in 4th seat when holding a hand like N, but here she gets to bid before EW have shown spades anyway|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: kibs asking 6@D      can make    but bad contract  |pg||
nt|h_karluk: no way|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: but last moment rethink :P|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No - Jacks are doubtful values and 3-3-3-4|pg||
nt|daman: michaels is a descriptive bid    doesn't have to be preemptive at all|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: what a sad way to end a bidding|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 3@d is the worst thing Adam can hear, maybe 3@h is even enough|pg||
nt|po-s: 2spades would not be constructive at all|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: I think 9 hcp with ruffing values is more than regular 10 hcp|pg||
nt|ady: 2@S  2nd negative|pg||
nt|pelu: great bid!|pg||
nt|haans: clubs lead ?|pg||
nt|szalay: I think 6@C is very optimistic, especially in all white|pg||
nt|szalay: all white is NOT a position where u need be greedy|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|chick: that's the normal way to play it ... preemptive or 18+ ... but of course you can do as you like :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Do you get a bonus when you have 14 top tricks?|pg||
nt|sybarra: and "flops" well as Henri would say |pg||
nt|haans: easiest grand in a long time|pg||
nt|copeyj: he will be able to count 12 tops|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: likely 11 tricks, next one|pg||
nt|ady: trump switch  will hold to 10|pg||
nt|marlowepi: many would bid 4H nonvul since EW have not found their spades yet|pg||
pc|h9|nt|rnmalik: agree was an observation|pg||
nt|pelu: 9½ out of 10 will lead @S|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|pelu: ½ lead @d! :)|pg||
nt|ady: natrual spade lead 9 tricks    this likely to be a swing for Australia|pg||
nt|Walddk4: All results (including butlers and hand records) at www.nbbportal.nl/1003/ > 'competitie'|pg||
nt|szalay: r u sure?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No intermediats|pg||
nt|rnmalik: N found no defense to 5@H and has settled for -2 as we see|pg||
nt|chick: I wonder what the difference between that sequence and 1N 3N is|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like 3NT has 9 tricks via 3@s , 2@h, 2@d and 2@c|pg||
nt|xenya: this rates to make  think|pg||
nt|haans: my guess 2@S 2nt replacement|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, Hans|pg||
nt|copeyj: and his part must have osmething extra for 15-17|pg||
pc|h8|nt|szalay: important thing after bad boards: leave table for a while and reconnect:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: All Israels I know play drury, maybe west didnt think his hand was good enough\|pg||
nt|ady: club lead will need spades 3-3 to pitch losing club   and heart lead will need king well placed|pg||
nt|sybarra: wrongsided this one|pg||
nt|frankaus: 3nt will make with the   @HJshort|pg||
nt|pelu: no|pg||
nt|szalay: trump LEAD does it|pg||
nt|ady: sorry   meant trump lead|pg||
nt|szalay: cause North could lead 2nd one|pg||
nt|szalay: I think to lead trump is close to suiced from South's seat|pg||
nt|rnmalik: and no DBL|pg||
nt|szalay: of course, it could make for 3-3 @S, but: in that case 5@HX is at least 500, can be 800|pg||
nt|szalay: I dont like to save|pg||
nt|szalay: I like when WE score|pg||
nt|haans: direct 5@H more angry|pg||
pc|h2|nt|Walddk4: He will get @CK after 5NT now and can count 13|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: Thomas came here yesterday, from Reno, and he had to go with plane to Paris and then with Train here... |pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|haans: weak responder 2 jacks|pg||
nt|haans: easy to raise @D|pg||
nt|xenya: this may be a swing as pass by W over 1N is a fair option|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|xenya: not for juniors perhaps though|pg||
nt|daman: http://www.bridgeguys.com/Conventions/MichaelsCuebid.html|pg||
pc|cA|nt|vugraphzeg: kleine kamer|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think an imaginary problem there : say east has AQ96-KT983-7-J42, okay guys, would bid 1@h or still double over 1@d? my opinion : if East wld X with that  hand then 2@d cue by W ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: gr8 :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: Probably take @C finesse and end up with 11 tricks|pg||
nt|szalay: and his pd has strong hand: give her the last decision:)|pg||
nt|haans: they have a diamond loser|pg||
nt|haans: i think 2@S had been a better bid|pg||
nt|po-s: nor is any bid except 2D - except possibly in some partnerships: 2H|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: right, I meant like xxx xxx KQxx xxx or something|pg||
nt|haans: well 3@D did say no slam today|pg||
pc|c7|nt|daman: it's all in there|pg||
pc|c8|nt|vugraphzeg: oops that was personal|pg||
nt|ady: clubs blocked fortunately|pg||
nt|sybarra: so you get lucky sometimes |pg||
nt|ady: east condiering unblocking  hoping 10@C with west|pg||
nt|h_karluk: with that junk even they show me full hands i could not dare to land 3@c|pg||
nt|haans: @CJ not cover not two entries to dummy|pg||
nt|copeyj: Volcker didnt bother|pg||
nt|haans: i say flat board|pg||
nt|copeyj: grand likely to be laydown, and very few hands from north could make it a bad grand i guess|pg||
nt|po-s: It seems Thomas has travelled the world - he has forgotten that in France it is forbidden to open 1NT with a 5card major|pg||
nt|copeyj: guillotine offence isn't it, Po?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Not among juniors, PO|pg||
nt|sybarra: must be only in france, no 5 card majors in 1 nt?|pg||
nt|po-s: T plays with his dad mostly, don´t forget|pg||
nt|sybarra: if he opens 1 @S, doesnt have a good rebid |pg||
nt|haans: in sweden we have had 5c M for 60 years in 1nt|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Worst case scenario is @CQJ, @HJ and @SJ|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|chick: lack of intermediates is what I see as the big problem -- half of S's hand is 5 or below|pg||
nt|Walddk4: And then the grand still has play|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c4|pc|c9|nt|VugraphPl1: http://michzimny.pl/bridge/2010/pila/gp.html|pg||
nt|ady: back to 10 maybe|pg||
nt|szalay: why @D?|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|ady: good play that unforunately gets no reward|pg||
nt|sybarra: valiant try |pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: both north and south complimented east|pg||
nt|sharkey: I wud bid 1@H|pg||
nt|haans: me 2|pg||
nt|hawe45:  North now asks himself: WHY did I take that trick?|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, declarer can't set up the long suit, so he should take Yuval's line|pg||
nt|xenya: and that's what he is doing it seems|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ady: yes|pg||
nt|szalay: its risky|pg||
nt|szalay: @C/@S is sure exit|pg||
nt|rnmalik: flat board|pg||
nt|szalay: when we need just 1 trick to set: lead safe is a basic rule|pg||
nt|szalay: just interchange Q and J of @D why was it terrible try|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|h_karluk: so that matters, 1@h just F1 fine|pg||
nt|haans: but how to get it|pg||
pc|s2|pc|c6|pg||
nt|sharkey: Think better let @C9 run as N pegged with @CA|pg||
nt|haans: or transfer bids|pg||
nt|haans: let overcaller lead :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: next...|pg||
nt|haans: best with void opps can not count their tricks|pg||
nt|marlowepi: on this deal 4HX would go for too much though|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s7|nt|vugraphzeg: I can't claim before they do|pg||
nt|pelu: we have a real top-match on here: France 1 = No 2 (126 VP after 6 matches) and NL Blue No 3 (113)|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|szalay: after this bidding trump lead is nearly automatic, imho|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|haans: had no reason to play @CK|pg||
nt|haans: 1 clubs loser deep finesse|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|chick: and I quote:  " the accepted point count should be between 5 high card points and 11 high card points, although the strength is again a matter of the partnership agreement."|pg||
pc|h4|nt|szalay: but Aces ar Aces:)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But you will find many 15/16 HCP-hands, who are stronger|pg||
pc|s5|pc|cT|pg||
pc|s9|nt|frankaus: another hand where after pd opens i would find it hard to stay out of game|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|h5|pg||
pc|sT|nt|xenya: the defence can't establish enought tricks, so declarer can develop slow tricks at his leisure|pg||
pc|h6|nt|chick: so if you want to argue that he had a good 11, I suppose you can consider you win this debate, but I still think it was too strong :)|pg||
nt|daman: By unfavorable vulnerability, the minimum high card points should be somewhat higher and stronger in honors.|pg||
pc|d2|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|s6|nt|pelu: NL Red No 1 with 128!|pg||

nt|szalay: routine 3N/5@C|pg||
nt|pelu: and also 3Nt in board 2|pg||
nt|sybarra: e/w can make a lot of hts here|pg||
nt|hawe45:  and they wiol get 450|pg||

nt|yuval10: S will be surprised to see his P opening|pg||
nt|h_karluk: just hook @h K and have fun|pg||
nt|szalay: I wd use exclusion RKC after xfer by South: 4@D-4@H-4@S/N (depends on RKC-style)|pg||
nt|h_karluk:  3 S had 0, now E has 1|pg||
nt|ady: 20-20 |pg||
nt|ady: however Netherlands got the 7 imps back hand 2  geting to game  where France stopped in 2NT|pg||
nt|daman: duh|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|vugraphzeg: south had 1 on 4 aswell and 2 on 2|pg||
mb|d|nt|h_karluk: pass by E?|pg||
nt|haans: agree with that pass|pg||
nt|szalay: btw I wd bid 3N immediately here: dont give them chance for right lead |pg||
nt|szalay: slam is very unlikely|pg||
nt|ady: n/s haved a choice   5@C  or 3NT     3NT scores better|pg||
nt|pelu: the 8. @C is the key-card for direct 3Nt - u dont need an H in @C from pd|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @S-lead might bring 480|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No...|pg||
nt|szalay: it requires a perfect sys and silent opps to bid it|pg||
nt|hawe45:  So am I - no double is OK|pg||
nt|szalay: 6+5+2=13|pg||
nt|haans: all jumps are not weak :)|pg||
nt|daman: on with the show|pg||
nt|copeyj: normal 4@S here for N/S|pg||
nt|copeyj: wonder what thomas will chose|pg||
nt|sybarra: think I will stay in 4 and hope for the OT|pg||
nt|haans: vul but off u go|pg||
mb|3D|nt|haans: easy to get -800|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: e/w have 9 tricks in spades as they lay|pg||
nt|yuval10: indeed, if 4@s is exclusion |pg||
nt|szalay: bid 6 or 7 depends on answer|pg||
nt|sharkey: Wonder if S knows what to do with all the points  - he'll probably drop stiff @SK to maje 4@S|pg||
nt|sharkey: *make|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and that's 10 boards sets, presumably predealt hands|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think that's wild|pg||
nt|sharkey: S may raise...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think i wld bid 3@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: he did, west goes into the tank now|pg||
nt|haans: west  do not promise @SK|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i dislike 3@d with 16 there|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - Vul at IMPs think it's right|pg||
nt|pelu: 2Nt = I can help in @c|pg||
nt|pelu: what can S bid now ? X for @S-stop?|pg||
nt|ady: not sure it right to settle for 3NT  switch K@D with A! north and west  then 6@C makes and 3NT down 1|pg||
nt|ady: k@D   and A@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: double on 2@S? Would  anybody else do that?|pg||
nt|ady: no   |pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: maybe my question also gives my opinion :)|pg||
nt|pelu: no X - in my book 5-card - or very strong 4-card suit - u can exp that pd bid 4@S over 3NT|pg||
nt|haans: stay low here|pg||
nt|haans: look 2+ is ALERTED all to learn|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: not alerted by Adam by the way.. but then again, he has so many|pg||
nt|haans: :) most forget it|pg||
nt|haans: going slamming|pg||
nt|copeyj: 4@C = shortage in @C game values 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: trash Stayman|pg||
nt|copeyj: wont make Volcker excited|pg||
mb|3H|nt|sharkey: Wud you pass and hope they land in NT?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: thanks Dennis :)|pg||
nt|haans: but give east a @D ruff then...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: now i pass to 4@d|pg||
nt|sharkey: After 1 NT opening West likely to be on lead anyway|pg||
nt|haans: and they are non vul|pg||
nt|pelu: I am with u Tim|pg||
nt|szalay: 2N: 14+, bal|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Yes - back to my first view|pg||
nt|szalay: 2@D was nat and GF|pg||
nt|xenya: NS might get in trouble now|pg||
nt|yuval10: 3@d by N perhaps?|pg||
nt|haans: 2@H = strong hand|pg||
nt|henryb:  pass perhaps?|pg||
nt|xenya: but just might -- N can rebid @Ds and S should pass|pg||
nt|haans: intermediate?|pg||
nt|copeyj: I am amazed Volcker has cue bid|pg||
nt|copeyj: he has nothing in partner's primary suit|pg||
nt|copeyj: he has a terrible holding in the splinter suit|pg||
nt|haans: spade 4-1 i say a killer |pg||
nt|copeyj: and he only has 4 trumps|pg||
nt|copeyj: North is pretty minimum, but he does have the nuts in controls|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W can;t be too comfortable doubling on that hand, but pass is too dangerous|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: to stay at the table is a bad habit..I think no kinda rule in bridge|pg||
nt|szalay: if North says 3@D exclusion RKC could help...and later a grand slamtry:|pg||
nt|haans: normal opening bid?|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: no, 2@h is weak, but with partner who passed it can still be strongish|pg||
nt|haans: ok ok|pg||
mb|4H|nt|haans: 2@H help me now|pg||
nt|ady: west trying to scramble to a better spot|pg||
nt|szalay: North wd accept with source of tricks, for sure|pg||
nt|szalay: I dunno why to ask stopper with QJx|pg||
nt|haans: rite u r|pg||
nt|daman: maybe a low intermediate|pg||
nt|daman: 10-13|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: brave man|pg||
mb|p|nt|VugraphPl1: sorry|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like a misunderstanding here|pg||
nt|sharkey: 4@D is crazy ....|pg||
nt|haans: wd|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think one should double when he/she's sure for -2|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: West gets whathe asked for|pg||
nt|davidb: hi good evening|pg||
nt|h_karluk: just curiosity, when someone would intervene?|pg||
nt|szalay: 4@D was optional RKC|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: std polish lead: low from doubleton|pg||
nt|ady: looks like down 1|pg||
nt|yuval10: but it will turn on the right side for NS|pg||
nt|h_karluk: bid 6 make 7 now, bid 7 go down 1 when @h K fails in a different layout|pg||
nt|daman: I have been told it is 9-13|pg||
pc|cA|nt|yuval10: 4NT probably interpreted as 1430 by S|pg||
nt|sybarra: awkwardly,  but "we" landed |pg||
nt|szalay: bad hand, 2KC and queen|pg||
nt|szalay: but he has 0:)|pg||
nt|copeyj: they are heading for slam now - they have 4/5 keys and Q trumps|pg||
pc|c2|nt|haans: 4m for me only as invite to 5|pg||
nt|haans: as good as 1nt ruffing @D|pg||
nt|ady: yes  nice contract    I dont agree with 3NT immediate |pg||
nt|po-s: Even 3-2 in trumps is nad enough if same hand has two diamonds|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ady: should east have removed to 2@S  with 3 in each?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think many would double to show equal strength|pg||
nt|haans: you win some lose some|pg||
nt|sybarra: likely to play for the drop in @H's |pg||
nt|hawe45:  4 boards 50 minutes|pg||
nt|xenya: exciting|pg||
nt|haans: dinessing inh spades|pg||
nt|yuval10: very good X by E, sensing the misfit|pg||
nt|haans: raise @D|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|xenya: but can they beat 3N?|pg||
nt|haans: if decl play spade = go up with Q|pg||
pc|c8|nt|szalay: some players play GF means: "forcing to 4-of-minor if 3N not possible"|pg||
nt|szalay: I predicted small slam|pg||
nt|szalay: good play is often slow play, imho|pg||
nt|haans: may still be a flat |pg||
nt|copeyj: what would you lead as west?|pg||
nt|copeyj: QX@D looks like a terrible holding|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: Thomas is hoping he has some extra's tho|pg||
nt|po-s: difficult lead|pg||
nt|haans: some say with 4 trump lead one|pg||
nt|copeyj: Volcker is, by the way, in the final of the French Open Trials - he defeated Bessis in the semi final!|pg||
nt|po-s: HJ perhaps??|pg||
nt|copeyj: and apparently Bessis is sat at the table writing out their convention card our operator tells me!|pg||
nt|copeyj: A trump has been suggested by some kibbers - but QX@D puts me off that - I would lead a @H and then it is a question of which @H to lead|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|haans: Hung may hope for 2nt from W|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hi David welcome aboard|pg||
nt|rnmalik: could S on 5@D bid 5@S?|pg||
nt|szalay: play will be fast|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Can't make it with spades 4-1 and diamonds 4-2|pg||
nt|haans: now decl to think what took so long|pg||
nt|po-s: could you with spades 3-2?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Depends who has 2|pg||
pc|cK|nt|h_karluk: i think i would definitely couldn't find that grand - when @h K wasn't at partner|pg||

nt|yuval10: E would've done better by ducking the @d|pg||
nt|henryb:  now that would not occur to me. I think X asks partner to lead MY suit|pg||
nt|haans: only one entry in spades|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|nt|ady: try a club|pg||
nt|haans: I would have played 2@H|pg||
nt|po-s: of course, but to consider the quality of the slam|pg||
nt|marlowepi: perhaps W thought that the double by E created a force (since E did not just bid some number of hearts at first turn). otherwise 4H seems questionable, with the poor minors. a ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: double pushing us to the 3-level should be 6 LTC so W doesnt have anything extra|pg||

pc|dQ|pg||
nt|haans: :) easy make :)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|szalay: small @S now|pg||
nt|ady: should cash out for -1|pg||
nt|haans: no more spade = spades 4-1|pg||
pc|s8|nt|h_karluk: and maybe they convert IMPs to 20 VP scale, eh ?|pg||
pc|s7|nt|daman: no more for NS|pg||
nt|marlowepi: especially since bad breaks can be expected. |pg||
mc|9|nt|haans: and 3 Q|pg||
nt|marlowepi: right|pg||
nt|haans: but 3@H may be forcing|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: West went for a toilet break|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but in my view W was right to think that the E auction created a force. I think it was E who overrated the value of his hand, with so much spade wastage, no shortness, and spades ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: due to be overruffed by N|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: they had a misunderstanding about 3@H forcing or not|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: East thought not, West thought it was|pg||

nt|rnmalik: or bad assessment:)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: rebid showed 18-19, so if there is a nearest game why not 3N by S|pg||
nt|szalay: touch and go 4@H|pg||
nt|szalay: it will makes if trump by opps: no option just staright @C hook|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 20-20 1st time there|pg||
nt|pelu: strong 2@C and positiv response - if East can show 4 controls - easy way to 6|pg||
nt|haans: not me but 1NT = 4 controls|pg||
nt|ady: 4 hearts fails with K@D wrong|pg||
nt|chick: There IS a guideline that says when the auction goes 2N P P, 4th seat should double on principle, because the dummy has no entries for finessing and declarer will have to play out ...|pg||
nt|chick: of his own hand |pg||
nt|chick: sometimes it works :)|pg||
nt|szalay: funny when it was passed out North could think: "ouch, may I double yet?"|pg||
nt|sybarra: true chick |pg||
nt|szalay: if pd has Q of @D: 3 off|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: de Pagter tried to trick Lazar on the last brd with discarding @d|pg||
nt|daman: partscore again|pg||
nt|daman: where are the slam hands?|pg||
nt|copeyj: pretty likely game swing to the Netherlands, that one|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 4@C usually contains a strong diamond suit, so I would be much happier with @DQ than @HK|pg||
nt|haans: defense losers more points than decl makes|pg||
nt|haans: was it a weak nt?|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: yes|pg||
nt|haans: ok|pg||
nt|haans: yep we all been there|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: 24-16 again partscore|pg||
nt|po-s: ATxx.AJx,AKQxx,x  is opener´s hand. If he gets 4S, should he bid again??|pg||
mb|1D|nt|szalay: 5431 is a good treatment|pg||
nt|szalay: Poles invented 5431-convention|pg||
nt|hawe45:  East will welcome a @S-opening + do.-support|pg||
nt|haans: not 2 aces K = 1 contraol Ace 2|pg||
nt|haans: all may be in @D'|pg||
nt|sybarra: but at imps,  maybe not always prudent |pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: I always find the making lead when my partner doubles on principle :(|pg||
nt|xenya: yes perhaps it means: pd, we have more points than they -- but so what?|pg||
nt|daman: what would we bid with the South hand?  1NT?|pg||
nt|chick: giving juniors too many slam hands can result in bids at the 8 level :)|pg||
mb|1H|nt|szalay: jump to 3M means: stiff major, 3card other major|pg||
nt|szalay: the weak nt|pg||
nt|szalay: East hand is interesting|pg||
nt|szalay: I wd rather dbl first and bid @S thereafter|pg||
mb|d|nt|szalay: (no entry back after ruffing finesse)|pg||
nt|szalay: easy 4@H/3N by E-W|pg||
nt|haans: best is 5@C/D|pg||
nt|yuval10: the favourable lie of the cards here mean that NS can make 12 tricks in both minors|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 3@s should end the auction, and poor W is almost endplayed already|pg||
nt|copeyj: Drijver will be pleased to see N bid 3@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: South alerted, almost bid 4@h, and then realised something|pg||
mb|2H|nt|szalay: especially usefull if u open 1N with 5card M|pg||
nt|sybarra: and will be happy to defend even undoubled |pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: true but transfer then bid game what do u loose?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think 1N then 2@s good, so you can play direct 2@s raise 8-10|pg||
nt|haans: x with void can be costly|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 2@c rebid then 2@s rebid, so all pass would also be nice|pg||
nt|szalay: In my book REOPENING 2@H shows kinda hand, what West has|pg||
nt|hawe45:  3 NT is the best spot|pg||
nt|szalay: so NO W2 in balancing seat|pg||
nt|daman: the double is probably t/o for the majors?    it was alerted|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: yes|pg||
nt|daman: S should pull|pg||
nt|haans: agressive|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: I guess I spoke too soon, maybe I should be disqualified as a junior|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: routin 3N is coming|pg||
nt|szalay: so here 1N-3@H-4@S|pg||
nt|ady: can make 6@S as they lay|pg||
nt|pelu: back - with cofee :)|pg||
nt|szalay: but its close decision, anyway|pg||
nt|szalay: I wd bid my suit if its NOT the highest ranking one|pg||
nt|daman: uh oh|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: if no trump lead/switch: he will ruff a @D|pg||
nt|frankaus: now is X pen?|pg||
nt|szalay: "who has the @Ss, has the power"|pg||
nt|szalay: as Lenin said 93 years ago|pg||
nt|szalay: (sadly he used "sowiets" instead of @s..he could play bridge|pg||
nt|szalay: could not|pg||
nt|szalay: btw did u know our games hero, Culbertson left Russia after Revoultion?|pg||
nt|szalay: his father was a civil engineer there|pg||
nt|haans: xenya we have all been there|pg||
nt|haans: 1@C mbs did cost this time|pg||
nt|xenya: well at least W avoided being endplayed|pg||
nt|haans: North have a lot of card for his 3@S|pg||
pc|d3|nt|sybarra: so 2 @S transfer to minor? |pg||
nt|szalay: but they wont bid with missing ace and trump queen|pg||
nt|pelu: over 4@C and no @D-cue West would know|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 4@H is a very poor game. It requires more than the diamond finesse|pg||
nt|haans: poerknight: yea but if u hear 4 controls and see 3 kings in ur hand it can only be 2 aces and riye he is|pg||
nt|pelu: so NL on the scoreboard|pg||
nt|haans: @HJ may cost|pg||
pc|d6|nt|h_karluk: i think passive trump lead auto there|pg||
nt|szalay: best defence is: cash 3 winners and @C|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - West should know pd's loaded; however, with 4 HCP too weak|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and maybe @h3 would give a better idea - say 3/5 leads thoroughout in sys card|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i did not get that 2@h|pg||
nt|chick: in balance seat, 2@H should show good 6 hearts and opening hand|pg||
nt|daman: I think the opps get their 7 before he gets his 7|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|szalay: in my book that is a slamtry in M, balanced|pg||
nt|szalay: to lose balanced slamtry with 6bagger is gap, anyway|pg||
nt|yuval10: now declarer can play A and Q@c discarding @s|pg||
nt|szalay: no ruffing finesse is suggested|pg||
nt|szalay: no 100% line, and could be lead from doubleton, but that is the best line, imho|pg||
nt|h_karluk: because you have 2 aces and 3 times trumps, whenever you are in can easily work to cut a ruff|pg||
nt|haans: many do not pen until opps reach game|pg||
nt|h_karluk: while found 5/2 @s fit why he got risk , hard question to reply|pg||
nt|davidb: easy  X  by N  -Ns  at least 6 trumps & more points|pg||
nt|haans: pass on 1nt = balanced hand|pg||
nt|h_karluk: F1N not in sys?|pg||
nt|szalay: back...its the most boring set so far|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|xenya: Poland got the 11 imps back quickly, when they stopped in game on 2 (6@H was the contract here) |pg||
nt|ady: north minimum  lacking aces   and wasted K@H  definately should settle for game|pg||
pc|dA|nt|Walddk4: Even on that lead, and with hearts 3-2, it can't make|pg||
nt|chick: there is no such thing as a preempt when opps have already quit bidding :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree Chick |pg||
nt|hawe45:  The 800 was only 500 in OR - same contract, and same 2 NT from West|pg||
nt|xenya: that's true, Hans|pg||
nt|yuval10: 3NT is a bad contract but can be made|pg||
nt|yuval10: by double finessing the @d's|pg||
nt|haans: a make if no @D loser|pg||
nt|daman: if he doesn't cover   he might only get 5|pg||
pc|d2|nt|szalay: I think South could bid 4@H with 3 aces over 3@S|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that would help East to see South has only a @h card|pg||
pc|d8|nt|szalay: imagine North has spade Q instead of K of @H|pg||
nt|sybarra: so -1 here|pg||
nt|szalay: we can talk cause its an absolutely uniteresting making 2@S|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: 3N seems like it should be doubled, but I really cannot see doubling from either side|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h8|nt|Walddk4: Our match in roúnd 3, in about 40 minutes, is USA vs Sweden|pg||
nt|haans: he he|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: uh oh|pg||
nt|daman: sweet|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I see your point, PO. The solution is perhaps to let a 2NT rebid be ambiguous and forcing. Then you have two ways of showing a singleton, either directly or via 2NT after responder ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: asks for clarification|pg||

nt|h_karluk: however could set|pg||
nt|sharkey: coulda - woulda .....|pg||
nt|haans: small @D is good play again 4-2|pg||
nt|copeyj: some pairs play 2NT as artificial raises - works well but will generally mean you lose something elsewhere - like you have to open all 18-19 balanced hands 1@C not 1@D for example|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: any one for 6@C|pg||
nt|ady: 6@C  easy to make for n/s|pg||

nt|szalay: 6@S is makes yet|pg||
nt|szalay: but that is really terrible|pg||
nt|rnmalik: and 6@C|pg||
nt|szalay: personally I wd bid 6@C as south, P/C|pg||

nt|vugraphzeg: she has gotten the hang of things|pg||
nt|daman: he has a great hand but he has to be conservative|pg||
nt|haans: Soth have no bid|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i see 12 tricks with in spired guess in spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: dont see other option than 3N now by North|pg||
nt|haans: urrk|pg||
nt|daman: sorry    she|pg||
nt|Walddk4: No more bad slams, please :)|pg||
nt|copeyj: well @D slam is pretty awful so I think 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzeg: connection was rather slow|pg||
nt|szalay: personally my preference list by Sout over 1@H is:|pg||
nt|szalay: pass, 1N....period....2@C|pg||
nt|haans: suprised they do not play trf here|pg||
nt|sharkey: if it's a "coulda" - probably too close to x at IMPs|pg||
nt|ady: west overcall on 4 card suit understandable|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our next match (and last today) in about 40 minutes: Norway vs Italy|pg||
nt|haans: South endbid :)|pg||
nt|szalay: with likely plus for n-s, anyway|pg||
nt|pelu: easy 1@s - u dont X on 5 card major exp u are very strong|pg||
nt|rnmalik: X must with this hand|pg||
nt|szalay: in this case often happens save over 7@C:)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Why not 5 NT by South - pick a minor - and 6 @C =  MY suit|pg||
nt|chick: conservative?  juniors?  they are fearless!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I like "pretty awful"|pg||
nt|haans: 3@H means suits not 3-2 (that often)|pg||
nt|haans: so keept it cool|pg||
nt|haans: low spade to t and a slow make in slam|pg||
nt|marlowepi: low spade to ten is the winner, but from a technical/statistical standpoint it is the worst of the three ways to try and pick up the whole spade suit|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it wins only against stiff nine, and there are two alternatives each of which is twice as good|pg||
nt|haans: agree to that|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: North told East that she doesn't know what to bid|pg||
nt|marlowepi: playing an honor from dummy first succeeds in two cases (stiff J/Q), and triple-finessing W also wins in two cases|pg||
nt|marlowepi: how does that differ from simply huddling? does a trance mean "i know what to bid, but i want you to think i don't" ? :):)|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: I don't know.. she just told it, i think it means more, I have no clue, rather than I have to make a choice between 2 bids|pg||
nt|haans: for beginner yes that who the bid|pg||
mb|d|nt|po-s: better to bid 2H - then East will be reluctant to bid NT|pg||
nt|copeyj: 3@S here showing @S stop and concern about @H|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe be playing this from side I did not expect |pg||
nt|haans: 3@S showing spade stopper hearts ???|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The grand slam hand is played in 6@D next door|pg||
nt|copeyj: very surprising|pg||
nt|haans: u mean the automatic grand?|pg||
nt|sybarra: the 14+ trick slam |pg||
nt|copeyj: wonder if Nab is worried that 3@S is asking|pg||
nt|copeyj: must be I guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: do u see any reason not to pass 2@H?|pg||
nt|szalay: or a strength showing double is an option yet|pg||
nt|xenya: on 3, where Israel bid up to 5@D here, the Poles in the other room reached an even worse contract -- 3N -- 3 off and 3 imps to Israel |pg||
nt|h_karluk: in new year teams, we were tied 42-42, then 3 more extension boards, again tied, and last board just won with 1 IMP |pg||
nt|szalay: personally I wd bid 3N over 2N|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: there's you slam|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 13 IMPs to France but they may get most of them back on the very next hand|pg||
nt|Walddk4: All of them in fact|pg||
nt|sybarra: these are not beginners |pg||
nt|haans: 5nt slam force?|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: opposite a 12-14 Nt?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: uh-oh, the worst of all possible choices.......slow double|pg||
mb|3S|nt|VugraphPl1: last board   thanks all |pg||
nt|daman: -1|pg||
nt|haans: i think 6@S was insulting p|pg||

nt|sybarra: 5 @C might stand a better chance |pg||
mb|p|nt|VugraphPl1: http://michzimny.pl/bridge/2010/pila/gp.html|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 @D by S?|pg||
nt|xenya: what do you think about N's double?|pg||
nt|frankaus: X do something sensible is a reasonable call |pg||
nt|sybarra: agressive?|pg||
nt|szalay: its normal, imho|pg||
nt|xenya: is it penalty?|pg||
nt|szalay: especially if u play sound overcalls..and send greetings to East for reopen|pg||
nt|xenya: penalty-orinted i should say|pg||
nt|szalay: 8-10, bid sthg, imho|pg||
nt|szalay: I doubt it|pg||
nt|frankaus: no here  - opps bid & raise  X = t/o|pg||
nt|szalay: btw if South passes and North bids @C a BIT easier, but isnt easy yet|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but makes with a lucky @d hook|pg||
nt|szalay: they play: minor ALWAYS P/C|pg||
nt|szalay: and NT means: I have a suit|pg||

nt|xenya: interesting 3N rebid: partner, i want to be in 3N even if you have 4 hearts? |pg||

nt|chick: actually, most of the interest in these hands has been the bidding|pg||
nt|haans: fiver|pg||
nt|xenya: thanks|pg||
mb|4H!|nt|szalay: I think North can double 4@S quite confidently|pg||
nt|szalay: or 3N yet..J9xxx in 1 suit, AK9x in other|pg||
nt|pelu: @D now will set up a ruff for East|pg||
nt|marlowepi: could be a director call|pg||
nt|marlowepi: slam makes on spade to ten|pg||
nt|haans: yep for sure |pg||
mb|d!|an|don't lead !H|nt|szalay: I dont like to play lowlevel dbls as penalty|pg||
nt|xenya: so it was for minors|pg||
nt|szalay: good point, Frank|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: Lotan put the Hoody of the sweater on his head after being doubled|pg||
nt|szalay: to lead stiff in pds suit is tempting|pg||
nt|pelu: the set look boring - but in almost all matches we have seen strang mistakes that cist - here good bridge|pg||
nt|hawe45:  OK|pg||
nt|copeyj: notice the @C suit here|pg||
nt|copeyj: declarer can afford one loser in @C and one in @H|pg||
nt|sybarra: none of these slams are "pretty"|pg||
nt|haans: 3@S very close|pg||
nt|sybarra: or makeable?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but in practice will fail|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: but 3@H is 500? |pg||
nt|marlowepi: double??|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: no @H lead pls partner|pg||
nt|haans: psych?|pg||
nt|ritong: double= pls lead something else|pg||
nt|haans: or negative double = do not lead my suit|pg||
mb|4S|nt|haans: what did x mean?|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: Takeout?|pg||
nt|haans: their are at least 3 variation of puppet so i refuse to play any online|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i am hairless and fearless, they are supposed to have fresh and strong hairs :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  E/W got the chance...|pg||
nt|sharkey: this match could be a blowout|pg||
nt|haans: can East ever have 4 spades|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Yes - we all know, what England RED means - after this battle|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: typical agressive junior double|pg||
nt|frankaus: t/o do something sensible|pg||
nt|haans: many bid 1@S to show five x to show 4 |pg||
nt|h_karluk: 2@h+4@c+1@s + 5@d are his tricks|pg||
nt|szalay: with 28-29 hcp 3N generally is safer in 2 balanced hands, cause no bad trump break|pg||
nt|chick: 3@C may be checkback|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Dangerous double - no defence against 4 @C|pg||
nt|sharkey: I like Dbl instead of 2@S - EW lost the whole 1 level thus they end up in this hopeless contract|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But played by South, 3 NT is percect - NOT by North|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: if u beat it 1 - what have u gained  - canu really expect to beat it 2 or more?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: he leads, and has @d A, planned after @s A knocked out wld score many tricks to set|pg||
nt|po-s: 5D is laydown|pg||
nt|copeyj: so can play for either JT onside or K onside by playing one to the 9|pg||
pc|dT|nt|szalay: not to play Q was a clear error, imho|pg||
nt|szalay: ruff and trump now|pg||
nt|drorp: hashavti ze helgemo hamavrik mibenehem|pg||
nt|ady: bold action from east     found partner with a useful hand including 4 clubs|pg||
nt|haans: may we see a hearts lead?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Yes, @C9 is a significant card|pg||
nt|copeyj: you can in fact make this with an overtrick|pg||
pc|d6|nt|hawe45:  To me, this is the 3rd best lead from the East-hand|pg||
pc|d5|nt|po-s: why not another club by East?|pg||
nt|haans: yes i can read (sry)|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|sybarra: hate to lead a @H with the South holding |pg||
pc|s5|nt|szalay: its strange to me that no one plays 3@C as puppet to 3@D: in that case u can stop in 3@D (crucial if u respond 1M with longer @Ds)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Only @H is worse|pg||
nt|Walddk4: As expected, the Dutch pair stopped short of slam on board 5|pg||
pc|s2|nt|hawe45:  Well done - Jack = @D|pg||
nt|sharkey: If S had @CK this wud make|pg||
nt|haans: but if they have not hearts stopper hearts lead good|pg||
nt|po-s: how did Drijver know that partner had diamond support?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: A wife always has support for her husband|pg||
pc|sT|nt|h_karluk: oh sorry i am wrong at @d|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and luckily @c K at his partner|pg||
nt|Walddk4: They may not quite be married yet, but ...|pg||
nt|copeyj: he can probably work out his partner has doubleton @S from the auction and that sort of suggests some @Ds, maybe if Nab had had lots of @C or something she would have acted over ...|pg||
nt|copeyj: 2@C i dont know|pg||
nt|haans: hurray|pg||
pc|sA|nt|szalay: making now|pg||
nt|pelu: 10 tricks on cross-ruff|pg||
nt|ady: could have got 200 from 1NTX|pg||
nt|po-s: and after this declarer play she might not want to|pg||
nt|ritong: so they reasonably stop in game with 31 hcp at best, balanced both hands|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|haans: a make|pg||
nt|marlowepi: to all specs who have written me: i know it means don;t lead a heart, but it is far from clear that E wants to send that message, especially since the call gives NS more options in ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: th bidding|pg||
pc|s6|nt|szalay: bad news: he knows going down|pg||
nt|szalay: good one: 50/trick|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|szalay: N-S deserved their fate|pg||
nt|szalay: oops|pg||
nt|haans: 2@C may be the winner|pg||
pc|sK|nt|szalay: North was in driving seat at trick 2|pg||
nt|szalay: he forget to play @D early...it wasnt so bad: after @C lead he fears of @C ruff...not now|pg||
nt|daman: the only way to make this is the Sominex Coup    take 20 minutes to play the hand...put the opps to sleep....and make a false claim which they accept|pg||
pc|hT|pc|s7|nt|sharkey: Indeed - things are going the Danes' way|pg||
nt|hawe45:  West can play the @H 3 to the 4...|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Rare also|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|szalay: he MUST solve it with xxxx trumps|pg||
nt|yuval10: and no X|pg||
pc|dK|nt|szalay: if we have small trumps, ruff and lead trumps generally the best move|pg||
nt|szalay: loser on loser, pls|pg||
pc|c7|nt|szalay: is it true?|pg||
nt|xenya: this can't be right|pg||
nt|Walddk4: He did not treasure the @C9, a pity|pg||
nt|haans: 3nt at or|pg||
nt|po-s: down now it seems|pg||
nt|copeyj: he knows the likely @C distribution but now has to guess if south started with KJX or JTX|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Against good players it is with the odds to go down now|pg||
nt|sybarra: and there is bd 5 |pg||
pc|d2|nt|sybarra: 13 back to Neth. |pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|haans: who plays J whit KJx|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|c3|pc|d3|nt|h_karluk: @dA marked|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Well, he survived, but we are not going to compliment him for his line|pg||

pc|d7|pc|h3|nt|xenya: but 8 tricks|pg||

pc|h9|nt|h_karluk: i am hairless and fearless, but Owen has long blond hairs, however in my book 3N quite interesting decision, well i think he'll not miss the chance to play in Gaitlinburg soon like ...|pg||

nt|xenya: np Jacco|pg||
nt|szalay: btw with bare KQ I suggest to take fist with King..but: if pd doesnt continue after Q-K: doesnt have more|pg||
nt|hawe45:  A void in every second board or so|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and 5-0 break, just 4 %|pg||
nt|haans: sad really|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that's the penultimate board and huge difference|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: I'm strung between seeing Andy (Hung) win, since he's a good friend and see my team lose... Hmmmmm|pg||
nt|daman: credit to the Italians for bouncing NS into a hopeless slam|pg||
nt|daman: things will calm down a bid    just a partscore|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: still they are yelling at each other, wish I would have pait better attention during my Latin classes|pg||
nt|po-s: forum - did you find that?|pg||
nt|xenya: good small spade from N, holding declarer to 9 |pg||
nt|haans: good point roland|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: EW have a lucky make in 5@D - limiting @D losers to 1|pg||
nt|haans: 30 min to next session|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: in my humble opinion this level of the play is not good at U20 yet|pg||
nt|frankaus: -470 is not a good number on a scoresheet|pg||
nt|szalay: I think at least 8 serious mistakes in 8 bds|pg||
nt|ady: 20-20 again   no fit    |pg||
nt|ady: whoever plays likely to go down|pg||
nt|yuval10: very quick session it was|pg||
nt|pelu: a @d-lead set up @DJ to discard for a major-loser|pg||
nt|ady: must have slipped in defence to let 3@C through|pg||
nt|h_karluk: well, i do not see any reason to begin with 3@c at 1st seat|pg||
nt|pelu: but defense could still kill @dJ by ruff|pg||
nt|ady: diamond lead may set up J@D  but that can beruffed out when west wins ace of clubs|pg||
nt|haans: but why do N wait|pg||
nt|haans: easy pass|pg||
nt|pelu: with screen we often have 2 bids a time|pg||
nt|h_karluk: when you use a preempt at 3 level at 1st seat that's only against economy of space principle|pg||
nt|pelu: so it could be East in problem|pg||
nt|haans: pass all|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|ady: this has esculated|pg||
nt|haans: but 4@S a make 2|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: the hand got rotated|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think i would prefer 4@s|pg||
nt|pelu: would u bid 3@D?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: why not|pg||
nt|haans: if u pass 3@C sitting west can you miss game then?|pg||
nt|szalay: 1@S probably denies 4card @S, values|pg||
nt|szalay: I hate this convention, but no time to discuss it now|pg||
mb|3C|nt|h_karluk: operator, undo?|pg||
nt|haans: sry :(|pg||
nt|rnmalik: very different bidding as compared to OR|pg||
nt|yuval10: W on the other room did very well by leading small @c against 3NT, let's see if it will be the same here|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: 2@D: NF (std Polish approx.)|pg||
nt|pelu: with a better @h-suit u could open 1@H but not with J high|pg||
nt|sybarra: just another "exciting" hand|pg||
nt|haans: i assume spade + minor (may be 4 @S??)|pg||
nt|haans: easiest @D to king = 9|pg||
nt|xenya: i don't understand this auction|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: 2@c was alerted I think, but I don't know what it means|pg||
nt|haans: 2@D must be conventional|pg||
mb|3D!|an|4M|nt|szalay: 3@C was @S raise|pg||
nt|sybarra: undoubled, that is good news |pg||
nt|ady: even undoubled  east west will lose several imps|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: OR led @d, let's see if they'll lead it again here|pg||
nt|yuval10: perhaps will opt to a @s|pg||
nt|h_karluk: seems bidding directions are wrong|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: nono, I bid correctly|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Only 180 degrees|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: cards are wrong. North is dealer but east has the west cards etc|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Not me|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think N would buy to 2@s|pg||
nt|szalay: double, pls|pg||
nt|chick: lebensohl sequence here|pg||
nt|yuval10: 2NT follows by 3@s i believe to ask stayman with @s stopper|pg||
nt|haans: 2 suits to cover |pg||
nt|haans: a good bid now is xx|pg||
nt|haans: if u have talked about it|pg||
nt|haans: dealy = no map |pg||
nt|chick: what would you play XX as, if you were S?|pg||
nt|xenya: tough for NS -- looks like they are in for a minus score now no matter what they might do|pg||
nt|po-s: - and if it means what you have agreed...|pg||
nt|haans: that would help|pg||
nt|yuval10: i only have pass and direct 3@s here.... Pass force for XX from S|pg||
nt|haans: hi sudden|pg||
nt|haans: how to find 5@D|pg||
mb|3S!|an|I have 4!H|nt|ady: doomed|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Rotten suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzeg: north and south also switched cards|pg||
nt|pelu: spects : 9-1 for pass :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: Kib avg age, Peter? :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i cannot use a double there because of @s Ax, i know the ovecall suit quality is not bright there |pg||
nt|haans: very like bidding prempt after prempt |pg||
nt|ady: this will be a slaughter|pg||
nt|haans: you just dont do that|pg||
nt|sybarra: and its j high with no good spots!|pg||
nt|hawe45:  In OR, South was no junior - passed in first hand, is that allowed in a junior-match?|pg||
nt|szalay: does anyone know meaning of bids?|pg||
nt|daman: no reason for South to bid|pg||
nt|chick: the OR has only played 5 boards (per the Movie), so it may be more than 30 minutes :)|pg||
nt|haans: fight every board|pg||
nt|xenya: anyway they reached a nice contract |pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: W: I hope you have really bad cards|pg||
nt|sybarra: puts pard (Nab) in difficult position |pg||
mb|4H|nt|h_karluk: to me good lead, could cost worse to a @d lead|pg||
nt|daman: who is foing the yelling now?|pg||
nt|daman: doing*|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: still the Italians|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: the players probably took the wrong cards out|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: nope they all took their own slot|pg||
nt|sharkey: score 33-0 to Denmark and more to come...|pg||
nt|chick: in an auction like this, I would play 4@C as Stayman, but no idea what they do|pg||
nt|sybarra: yikes guys!! |pg||
nt|haans: Haans: who plays J whit KJx Walddk4: A good player does, Hans, and Volcker is doc_jo: is volcker a good player??? ->doc_jo: Roland say and Roland ... |pg||
nt|haans: puppet|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: I confess I could pass as East automatically|pg||
nt|szalay: over 1@C|pg||
nt|daman: they just got +100 from thin air|pg||
nt|xenya: W has his hope i think |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: may make 6 now |pg||
nt|haans: holy ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: too much technical stuff for me, i only know on/off button and how to use a mouse :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: you're advanced Hamdi...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: omg, after long years i learnt to use email system:)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  What is e-mail...?|pg||
nt|sharkey: ask Hamdo hans :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: ik heb een geheel gedraaid spel. Kan je een arbiter roepen?|pg||
nt|sharkey: Hamdi|pg||
nt|h_karluk: at start i thought, some guy's name in Venezuala, bcos i saw a video abt it |pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: tell oops was trying to contact someone else in the building|pg||
nt|hawe45:  And you might invite with 4 NT directly also|pg||
nt|szalay: well done Brigitta|pg||
nt|rnmalik: some imps coming your way with X also|pg||
nt|szalay: she wears the jeans|pg||
nt|marlowepi: expect trunmpo lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: std. puppet auction |pg||
pc|h3|nt|frankaus: pass is the hardest bid to master in bridge :)|pg||
nt|szalay: light openings and overcalls they style can live cause another side|pg||
nt|ady: heart shift  best|pg||
nt|rnmalik: no other choice I think|pg||
nt|ady: hand 16 where west was down 1 in 4@H doubled   in OR  n/s made 4@D re-doubled|pg||
nt|ady: was 11 imps for world team|pg||
nt|rnmalik: compensation here for NS might gain some|pg||
nt|pelu: 4 out of 5 : I am junior :):)|pg||
nt|haans: psych|pg||
pc|h2|nt|hawe45:  Wonder what 1 @S was - since East introduced a suit with 7-6-5-4 at the 4-level|pg||
pc|h7|nt|szalay: I think to open 7-4 in white is good bridge, regardless of your age|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Now South likes his hand|pg||
nt|szalay: in white/red 4@C is an option, imho|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|h_karluk: could also play for divided @d honours|pg||
nt|h_karluk: seems preferred 3-3 35/6 %|pg||
nt|haans: 4th 5th spade|pg||
nt|hawe45:  That was what I tried to indicate..!|pg||
nt|chick: lucky for declarer, @SJ10 fall|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Still 2 losers|pg||
nt|szalay: likely 500 and 12 imps for Hungary..and: new leader:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: de Pagter wondering out loud whether Hop should've bid 2NT|pg||
nt|szalay: 1@S was: comp values, at most 3@S|pg||
pc|hK|nt|sharkey: we can follow jacco - just finsih the hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: true but the other table played the hand it was supposed to be played|pg||
nt|sharkey: Makes on low @C lead...|pg||
nt|haans: opinion: gronkvist: they must cancel the board gronkvist: will the laws says so|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h8|nt|szalay: u wont punish for light openings cause light overcalls and vica versa|pg||
nt|szalay: why not to take @C in hand?|pg||
nt|szalay: to start @D ruff?|pg||
nt|frankaus: maybe planning on a dummy reversal|pg||
nt|po-s: there is a narrow path perhaps to go down|pg||
nt|haans: still you have @D to K|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|sybarra: he may be thinking same thing,  maybe played too fast |pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: Now they're all saying I'm junior to me :P|pg||
nt|szalay: the tipical terrible "fashion-convention"|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: 1@s showing less than 4 @s's, 8+ hcp|pg||
nt|szalay: it looks 800 now|pg||
nt|daman: they should be hugging each other|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: not in their  blood i think|pg||
nt|marlowepi: making 5|pg||
pc|h5|nt|vugraphzeg: I could led the right guy lead but he led small club|pg||
nt|daman: nah  that's true|pg||
pc|h6|nt|hawe45:  Then I think, that East had minimum for his 4 @C-bid...!|pg||
nt|xenya: strange line of play|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|s3|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: I love how 3/10 are people I know|pg||

nt|vugraphzeg: yep|pg||
nt|haans: a spade please|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: they like nice clothes and to yell|pg||

nt|daman: and gelato|pg||
pc|c8|nt|h_karluk: ok sir, thanks :)|pg||
nt|chick: yes, switch the @S8 and 7, different story|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ady: now K@C and club|pg||
nt|h_karluk: okay, say you entered the score, it helps to see in comparison? |pg||
nt|hawe45:  Not allowed|pg||
nt|po-s: yes but obviously declarer was afraid of getting a diamond played from North|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|h_karluk: well, seriously i do not think we can have ideal conditions at all times|pg||
nt|h_karluk: how they say? umm - lesser evil <my review>|pg||
nt|Walddk4: That's what pre-empts are for, but I don't think Edgtton had a serious problem with that hand|pg||
nt|h_karluk: soon east would be endplayed with a careful timing|pg||
nt|haans: opps in the dark|pg||
nt|szalay: the East probably didnt read Rodwell interview:|pg||
pc|c7|nt|szalay: to take trick first and think thereafter isnt a good omen|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sybarra: why not pitch ht|pg||
nt|sybarra: or is that the exit card?|pg||
nt|daman: East is in trouble |pg||
nt|marlowepi: trump lead will cause N to go right in spades|pg||
pc|cT|nt|haans: lavinthal for @H?|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @H pitchwas better but kept an exit card|pg||
nt|marlowepi: good duck by E|pg||
nt|haans: only 1 spade loser|pg||
nt|haans: so boring|pg||
pc|c5|nt|szalay: why Ten?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that was the question|pg||
nt|haans: many would have forgotten to alert responders pass denying 3 spades|pg||

pc|d6|nt|szalay: but first: make plan, move after that|pg||
nt|ady: down 4|pg||
nt|haans: normal carding?|pg||
nt|po-s: perhaps declarer could figure out that North had the SK, and duck the spade|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i mean diamonds|pg||
pc|d2|nt|haans: @H7 =========== no|pg||
pc|dA|nt|hawe45:  Entry-problems when decl sees the @D-layout|pg||
nt|sybarra: and possible he takes the @H's hook |pg||
nt|hawe45:  Which will lead to a HUGE score|pg||
pc|d5|pg||

nt|daman: well done Turkey|pg||

mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|petergill: On a non-@d lead, even if there's a spade loser, you can pitch a heart on clubs and test for hearts 3-3, so it's a good slam|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|davidb: it is a good slam -many options |pg||
mb|5D|nt|yuval10: indeed Peter|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: now 6 is on and cards are friendly|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|yuval10: 5@s asking for Q and 5@s now probably|pg||
nt|yuval10: 5@h rather|pg||
nt|petergill: Meaning of 3NT - does anyone know?|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@C and 4@H were cue-bids|pg||
nt|davidb: 1sp-2c-2sp shows 6 card so now 5sp|pg||
nt|vugraphzef: 3 nt is serious |pg||
nt|davidb: cards|pg||
nt|davidb: but J sp is extra |pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|yuval10: hmmm....|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|petergill: 5@D 0 or 3, 5@H asks for @SQ, when West denied @SQ, East misread the situation|pg||

nt|ady: thx all|pg||
nt|sybarra: Thanks also to our specs who give us helpful comments and some humor!|pg||
nt|szalay: does West have way to show @D lead?|pg||
nt|szalay: or may be HIS lead, even better:)|pg||
nt|ady: if west is on lead to 3NT  may choose a heart when east has shown majors|pg||
nt|szalay: a bit optimistic, but acceptable 5@C|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 7/5/1 long time not seen|pg||
nt|haans: 1@C mbs?|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@s in OR = 5 card @S + a minor|pg||
nt|rnmalik: no denying |pg||
nt|szalay: as many specs asked:|pg||

nt|vugraphzeg: yes play went very fast here so that is why|pg||
nt|szalay: fast play seldom means good|pg||
nt|frankaus: fine operating Jacco <clap> <clap> <clap> <clap>|pg||
nt|szalay: I think South has INV with @Cs, lets say 3@C is normal or 2N...|pg||
nt|pelu: by West|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Strange, that 6 NT went down - you have 12 tricks with safin the @D-suit and take the losing @H-finesse|pg||
nt|szalay: South is female and 16-years old only|pg||
nt|szalay: 3@D was Rubenshol: @Hs, inv +|pg||
nt|szalay: doubt West wd pass it|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: 3@D Switch, rather|pg||
nt|szalay: switch: dom and sub in one?:)|pg||
nt|szalay: South of course passes|pg||
nt|sybarra: LOL,  it was HOP,  I just followed what was on profile  |pg||
mb|p|mb|3S!|nt|vugraphzeg: it was west thinking but i try to do 2 bids at a time|pg||
nt|sybarra: this looks like it should make |pg||
nt|szalay: r u sure?|pg||
nt|xenya: i wonder|pg||
nt|szalay: 1@S, 1@H and how many @Cs?|pg||
nt|ady: looks like west has mis understood partners bid|pg||
nt|szalay: its Molenaar's double session|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: west might have explained this as weak with @d|pg||
nt|h_karluk: imho 5@c unbelievable|pg||
nt|haans: 3 down in 5@Cx|pg||
nt|haans: 2|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 2@C is not an overbid|pg||
nt|h_karluk: could any lead a trump from QT - say to 5 clubs contract? :)|pg||
nt|haans: 3@Dx|pg||
nt|szalay: thx all, it was fun, and interesting|pg||
nt|szalay: probably West, her screenmate is trhinking|pg||
nt|szalay: am I right?|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: correct|pg||
nt|szalay: Danke|pg||
nt|rnmalik: absolutely and difficult waters for EW|pg||
nt|szalay: 4@S RKC or rather cue?|pg||
nt|szalay: muddy waters, rather|pg||
nt|sybarra: next match: israel-Neth. blue|pg||
nt|haans: 20 min to next session|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: thats in about 20 min from now.|pg||
nt|sybarra: Our gratitude to the NBB for brining this wonderful tourney to BBO.  |pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: possibly 3@s would come|pg||
nt|xenya: http://www.jeugdbridge.nl/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=85&Itemid=79 for standings after 9 rounds|pg||
nt|haans: we thank you Shirley :)|pg||

mb|4H|an|cuebid|nt|szalay: I think its going down for @S lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: yikes!!  here we go again|pg||
nt|szalay: 6@C for sure|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: East wasnt passing, I could tell you that|pg||
nt|xenya: E seems to have taken partner's 4@C too seriously|pg||
nt|h_karluk: what would you lead vs 5@c ? @h A/K or @s A+x ? :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: @C|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT the easiest as they lay    but likely to play 5@C  which would certainly go down to a trump lead   4@H can make|pg||
nt|haans: at last|pg||
nt|daman: thanks to th NBB for letting us bring this to you    thanks also to the Sponsors|pg||
nt|sybarra: Special thanks to Kees Tammens and Hans van Staveren, and sponsors Max Abram, Herman Drenkelford, Peter Sisselaar and Jos Janssens.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: bid 7S, get trump lead, double squeeze|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: E likes his hand|pg||
nt|haans: game at or|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i do not believe my eyes, 4261 with 6 hcp and 3@d 3rd seat both nonvul :)|pg||
nt|davidb: not a  lucky decision |pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: anyone dare interpret this auction?|pg||
nt|haans: a make (i think) :)|pg||
nt|haans: missed hearts so will we know|pg||
nt|sybarra: Special thanks to Kees Tammens and Hans van Staveren, and sponsors Max Abram, Herman Drenkelford, Peter Sisselaar and Jos Janssens.!|pg||
nt|haans: but no @SQ so no 7|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: the Next match broadcasted will be Australa agains Worldteam (Japan/czech combination)|pg||
nt|sybarra: Thanks also to our specs who give us helpful comments and some humor!|pg||
nt|ritong: not even 6 other room  extremely prudent|pg||
nt|marlowepi: cautious juniors--what is this world coming to?|pg||
nt|haans: :) good one :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E has to cue now|pg||
nt|haans: rkc|pg||
nt|marlowepi: especially if 2S showed six, and/or if not playing 3N vs. cuebid distingishes serious from nonserious slam try|pg||
mb|4S|nt|haans: dbl gazzili like bid?|pg||
nt|ady: not likely to play 4@H|pg||
nt|frankaus: have you heard my view on playing 5 minor contracts?|pg||
nt|ady: managed 3NY OR|pg||
nt|ady: OR|pg||
nt|h_karluk: esp when N showed his interest on unbid suits (the reds)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: sorry there were a huge misjudgement|pg||
nt|sybarra: might we try 3 @C now?|pg||
nt|pelu: ther5e are 8 "top" tricks - but not when u take @cK (see the 10) and run @cJ :(|pg||
nt|ady: must have got club position wrong in OR  to go so badly down in 3NT     low club and when 10 appeared went up with king and finessed 9|pg||
nt|pelu: 0,1 sec late, David :)|pg||
nt|ady: yes    you are too quick for me Peter|pg||
nt|haans: hearts right|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Spades are blocked but still only 8 tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Declarer's best chance is to duck at trick 1|pg||
nt|haans: wai'th with @CA|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: if u travel across the World, better to agree 2suiter overcalls|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: the problem was the semi natural 1@c openingbid i think|pg||
nt|szalay: if a bid (semi)natural, better to treat it as natural, eg. to play (1m)-2m as Michaels vs. prepared 1m yet|pg||
nt|sybarra: likely to misguess hts here also |pg||
nt|h_karluk: obviously - east players happy with that 7 hcp|pg||
nt|yuval10: maybe too much for a 4-3-3-3 hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: 4@S cue|pg||
nt|szalay: I predict -1 and Hungary's win|pg||
nt|yuval10: this is the last board of the 10th round now|pg||
nt|chick: S is likely to get endplayed |pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: declarer didn't play for endplay but just claimed on 2 finesses|pg||
nt|yuval10: you can hardly endplay him|pg||
nt|daman: and thanks to BBO    without them we would not be able to watch this|pg||
mb|p|nt|szalay: but grand slam try with missing ace was a mistake, anyway|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: 1430, I guess|pg||
nt|xenya: admittedly, he does have a great hand|pg||
nt|szalay: nbo pressure for N-S now|pg||
nt|szalay: the real issue is 3m is nat or stopper asking|pg||
nt|haans: not to happy with @H lead|pg||
nt|ady: in what   4@H?|pg||
nt|haans: nt|pg||
nt|frankaus: its like kissing your own sister - even when its right ---- its hard to get excited about your prospects|pg||
nt|szalay: any bet?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Good defense now and we have a new leader:)|pg||
nt|szalay: every dutchman says: he will make it|pg||
nt|szalay: btw, this is the last board of set and last set for me|pg||
nt|szalay: thx all your patience, it was funny, anyway|pg||
nt|xenya: no defense, however good, will work if declarer gets @Hs right|pg||
nt|szalay: that is what bet about|pg||
nt|szalay: bt w to play safety @H in good direction is risky:|pg||
nt|szalay: he could lose 2 @Ds and a @H|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hi Vladimir:)|pg||
nt|szalay: so better to play for @H to king and small one, imho|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Rashed:)|pg||
nt|szalay: do u agree?|pg||
nt|xenya: thanks everyone|pg||
nt|po-s: why not|pg||
nt|chick: don't have to, it's automatic|pg||
nt|po-s: why would you need to - in 5H defenders helped a lot|pg||
nt|haans: sry|pg||
nt|sybarra: Thanks also to our specs who give us helpful comments and some humor! |pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Is this result correct from =R - 10 tricks with two @H-losers and 3 potential trump-losers?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  From OR|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But still|pg||
nt|haans: they may still be relaying|pg||
nt|haans: ops|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: Lotan looked at me very disappointed|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if you are going to bid 4S, at least do it in tempo|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|szalay: time for @S switch yet, and likely 2 off|pg||
nt|szalay: c u in 30 minutes|pg||
nt|szalay: byebye|pg||
nt|pelu: now 25-0 could be 25-24!|pg||
nt|haans: hung is trying to show his strength|pg||
nt|ady: yes Netherlands good comeback|pg||
nt|Walddk4: If he thinks he has that strong a hand, why did he not reverse into 2@H?|pg||
nt|ady: well the 2 club rebid did not exactly convey the hand|pg||
nt|haans: his opinion for a long time|pg||
nt|davidb: to leave the X . 3D  is ok for  juniors openings|pg||
nt|rnmalik: might play small from table to 9-safety play|pg||
nt|ritong: ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: like he bid like an old man|pg||
nt|marlowepi: or someone who was once an old man:)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|h_karluk: thanks, you interpreted my feelings :)|pg||
nt|szalay: it will be push, thx all, c u soon|pg||
nt|h_karluk: thx buddy, c ya soon|pg||
nt|szalay: so from 52 cards 5@H is makeable now|pg||
nt|daman: the next session is scheduled for 12 minutes from now|pg||
pc|h5|nt|haans: once again holy ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: a-ha North pushes his opps to game|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 4@C er helt ude i hampen|pg||
nt|frankaus: may escape  with -2|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: south asking west what double means|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: west doesnt have a real clue|pg||
nt|sybarra: how about "I think we can beat the contract"  as an answer|pg||
nt|Walddk4: And they can|pg||
nt|ritong: there is no reason to bid quickly, since west must pass 4@s no matter what|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|xenya: but S preempted -- that may be a factor|pg||
pc|sA|nt|sharkey: Sac vs 3@H?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: there were a passed hand double and imho showed @h+@d|pg||
nt|pelu: the problem is that the X from = @H, so 2@h is what??|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Maybe that's too simple|pg||
nt|haans: we have said neither|pg||
nt|pelu: so play: X = dont lead @s|pg||
nt|Walddk4: but will they?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|xenya: this stands no chance of course -- let's see if he can get out for -1|pg||
nt|ady: high spade likely lead|pg||
nt|pelu: some play after opp has shown 2 suits, that a bid here is sopper and no stopper in the other suit|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hope they make postmortem especially about this board|pg||
nt|sybarra: ht lead spade thru?|pg||
nt|daman: sorry  22 minutes|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Walddk4: sorry for speaking Danish|pg||
nt|h_karluk: makeable now|pg||
nt|haans: small @D????????????????|pg||
nt|ady: win and duck a heart  will make|pg||
nt|ady: I think this may be down 1   so -200  will gain against 400 OR|pg||
nt|sybarra: or now,  of @S, H! switch,  spade thru?|pg||
nt|pelu: in S some play RD = I am not sure we sh play 3Nt and Pass = OK with me|pg||
nt|szalay: I just said: its not the percentage line|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|frankaus: bed time here back latter in day european time|pg||
nt|vugraphzeg: yes this happened, north couldnt play south for 4@D|pg||
nt|xenya: i doubt that -- W's clubs are too small|pg||
nt|xenya: setting up @Ds would mean seetting up trump tricks for N|pg||
nt|sybarra: cu frank @H |pg||
nt|xenya: but i overlooked the fact that the defence had presented E with a trick -- now he certainly can make 11 and must be thinking how to get 12  |pg||
nt|sybarra: this doesnt look too tricky for declarer |pg||
pc|sK|nt|ady: can establish spades    but has no trump control|pg||
nt|h_karluk: !k was the lead i expected|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @h K|pg||
nt|sharkey: Actually first time the Danes made a "crazy" bid this match I think|pg||
nt|daman: that may not happen     this match is behind|pg||
pc|s6|nt|Walddk4: West must switch to a diamond, heart not good enough|pg||
nt|pelu: doubtshowing RD|pg||
nt|rnmalik: new leader:)|pg||
nt|szalay: declarer played it weel after an agressive bidding|pg||
nt|szalay: was unlucky, and Hungary won by 9|pg||
nt|szalay: sry, by 7|pg||
nt|szalay: 17-13 is the final result of the Derby of Calvinists|pg||
nt|szalay: c u soon, gotta go for tourney|pg||
pc|s9|nt|h_karluk: however their maters scored +620|pg||
nt|haans: all card for opps|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|marlowepi: why is that? W is unlimited|pg||
nt|haans: they missed in or 2|pg||
nt|ritong: unlimited, but denied minor controls|pg||
nt|haans: thyey at least got to 5|pg||
pc|d8|nt|haans: gave up|pg||
pc|d3|nt|pelu: wow|pg||
nt|pelu: now the @cs|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Well, I did not think I got to mention the Bath Coup|pg||
