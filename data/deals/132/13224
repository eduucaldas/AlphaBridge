nt|petergill: our not out|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If you have a good relay system over a raise, I would rebid 2@S rather than 1NT|pg||
nt|petergill: without @H10, a simple 3NT bid would be enough|pg||
mb|4N|nt|daman: mind you     East still must find the lead|pg||
nt|petergill: If systemically permitted, I too would raise 1@S to 2@S - that xx in clubs makes me not want to play NT from my side|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Then 6NT would be right-sided because the relay is 2NT|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|nt|daman: oh wow|pg||

nt|Walddk2: yes|pg||

nt|daman: outh knows it is on the 4-3|pg||
nt|davidb: with J spade would be perfect|pg||
nt|daman: South*|pg||
nt|petergill: East has no reason to prefer a club lead to a @D lead. I think|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Still, even if Tarnovski pulls to 6NT, Franchi will have to find the right minor to lead|pg||
nt|petergill: Israel need the swing here, to get back in the match|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Manual, page 1: "Do not correct obvious taipoos"|pg||
nt|daman: spellers of the world  "Untie!!!"|pg||
nt|davidb: 2  decisions - by S & than by E (if 6NT)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: All France 1 at the moment in the other match. Now up by 14|pg||
nt|daman: I would be passing    expecting KJx of @S |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|daman: my Mom would pass    that way she would get to play it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6@S is lucky, but well done anyway|pg||
nt|daman: Bravo to Israel|pg||
nt|petergill: I prefer Roland's "2@S raise" method of rightsiding the hand in 6NT to this delayed way of rightsiding the slam|pg||
nt|davidb: still a long way -no  boards to recover |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Plenty of boards|pg||
nt|daman: he will not be happy when he sees dummy     but after drawing trumps he will be all smiles :):):)|pg||
nt|petergill: Being a bit lucky when you're down 28 imps is a skill that Meckstroth - Rodwell and other top players somehow seem to have. |pg||

mb|2S|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Our appreciation to the NBB (Kees Tammens and Hans van Staveren) and to the sponsors, Max Abram, Herman Drenkelford, Peter Sisselaar and Jos Janssen, for ensuring that this ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: wonderful event is brought to BBO vugraph. Much appreciated by bridge fans all over the world|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@S cue bid of opponent's suit to show good hand |pg||
nt|daman: and we have BBO to thank as well     without them, this would be impossible|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3C|nt|petergill: They will end up in 3NT I think. 6@C is not likely to make with trumps 4-1|pg||
nt|petergill: South might raise to 4@C|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|an|*|nt|yuval10: double-dummy 6@c is cold, but don't think they'll reach there|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|petergill: North might have simply bid 3Nt over 2NT. When suits aren't breaking, as warned by East's bid, stopping in 3NT before the bad breaks ruin you is often good|pg||
nt|daman: if they do, it will be anti-climactic|pg||
nt|Walddk2: France1 in the final, by 4 IMPs|pg||
nt|petergill: If South bids 4@c and they bid and make 6@C, we will just have to think that one great team is out of the event|pg||
nt|petergill: In 6@C, I think you have to take the @D finesse - else entries become a problem, with spades 5-1|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The final is started to begin in 20 minutes, but we may be facing a slight delay. Stay tuned in the lobby|pg||
nt|petergill: Bar Tarnovski has no idea that the match is over, so he will take his time, in case this is vital|pg||
nt|Walddk2: *scheduled|pg||
nt|petergill: I think he is thinking that he should pass, but that the Italians have given nothing away all match, so to win the match he might have to try for 6@C |pg||
nt|daman: except for Board 15    NS have every reason to think they have picked up 20 Imps in this session|pg||
nt|daman: well   the Italians went down in a cold vulnerable game and NS bid  great slam|pg||
nt|petergill: and 20 is not enough - they were behind by about 30 at the start of the segment|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That "cold" game was not that easy to play|pg||
nt|daman: wien the @D 10 was played it was pretty easy|pg||
nt|petergill: Not cold, that game - it will go off more often than not, I think|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|daman: made 5 at the other tebale|pg||
nt|petergill: I wonder if these are the same thoughts that Bar Tarnovski is having?|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|petergill: Or is he trying  to break my record for the slowest bid or play on BBO this week? |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|hK|nt|daman: we have Muller coming tomorrow and Sunday      HE is slow|pg||

pc|c3|pc|h4|pc|cK|pc|c5|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I can't figure out what Fisher's style is. Sometimes he overbids by miles, and sometimes he signs off when he has more to show|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@S showed a big hand  - partner was a Passed hand - I think North thought that |pg||
nt|petergill: South needed North to be big and 5/5 in the minors for slam to be on|pg||
