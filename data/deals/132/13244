nt|roswolf: simple 6nt playable by west|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well defended by East, given every chance to go wrong...|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: 12 imp difference isn't that much, not a time for swinging|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|1H|mb|d|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|2H|nt|wilkinsona: 6 a good contract, but heart break...|pg||
mb|2S|nt|roswolf: must be forcing i guess|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: auction of interest|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzdu: 2@d seems to be no interest in @h|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: doubtless north under pressure on the run of the diamonds|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup especially if the club has been played early|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hJ|nt|wilkinsona: in other room, N failed to cash his ace when given the diamond|pg||
nt|roswolf: in 4nt you can understand that|pg||
pc|hK|nt|wilkinsona: sorry the heart|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jbgood: hi all|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Hi Jon|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hei Jon|pg||
pc|h4|nt|dburn: 2@c here was not "garbage Stayman" - it showed 4+ hearts|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Hi Roland too|pg||
pc|c7|pc|h7|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Tony|pg||
pc|c9|nt|wilkinsona: dont now that a club lead helps..|pg||
nt|roswolf: well slamwards but will need to be inspired in the play|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: and David, where have all you lads been all this time?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdu: please take explanations with large grain of salt|pg||
nt|dburn: and 2@d showed a doubleton heart, and Crouch passed hoping for the best|pg||
nt|vugraphzdu: my explanations I mean of course|pg||
nt|jbgood: not an everyday treatement over 1 NT |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well Tony, we have had a few tables up this weekend|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c5|pc|c2|pg||

pc|d3|pc|dA|nt|dburn: well, maybe onlly two at these colours|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d9|pc|c3|pc|d4|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|wilkinsona: dont think this can go down, I really think the 6 diamond bid excellent|pg||
nt|roswolf: while this can be made it wont i fear|pg||
nt|roswolf: he might try and ruff a spade|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: thats ok|pg||
nt|roswolf: not unless he ruffs high and finesses the 8|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: wait..I see..|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: right Roland, great BBO|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|nt|wilkinsona: yes sorry..|pg||
nt|jbgood: great BBO is even a slight understatement..|pg||

pc|c6|pc|h2|nt|wilkinsona: specs looking for a squeese on north|pg||

pc|c8|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|brolucius: A fine effort by Patterson in the bidding. So unlucky!|pg||

nt|roswolf: contributions keep us on our toes.|pg||
nt|vugraphzdu: any updates on tournament situation for the kibs?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|2D|an|flannery|nt|Walddk2: NI won by 12 against ROI|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: so last hand so the usual thank yous to everyone concerened|pg||
nt|golfsquash: England cruising to the title|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Don't know about Wales-NIBU|pg||
mb|2N|nt|roswolf: another slam hand needing to overcome the distribution|pg||
nt|brolucius: Actual bidding in the Open Room was 1@C - 1@H - Pass - 3@H; Dble - Pass - 3NT - Pass; 4@S.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: England has won the Camrose Trophy on 48 occasions (49 in a minute), Scotland on 13, with these two teams tied twice. The Republic of Ireland won five times, whereas Northern ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Ireland and Wales have yet to win|pg||
nt|vugraphzdu: spears thinking how high|pg||
nt|jbgood: semipositive transfer - big clubbers have also transferred to transfers:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Wales beat NIBU by about 30, I hear|pg||
mb|3N|nt|roswolf: forcing hopefully|pg||
mb|p|nt|eamongall: thats about 20-10 in VPs|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: not sure what Crouch is supposed to do other than double|pg||
nt|roswolf: might punt 6@C|pg||
nt|dburn: but Patterson may be planning to pull to 5@c as a slam try|pg||
nt|dburn: or even to bid 6@c now|pg||
mb|p|pc|s6|nt|eamongall: 29-34 is 20-10|pg||
nt|vugraphzdu: ending with a whimper here apparently|pg||
pc|s4|nt|Walddk2: What about NI's 12 IMP win against ROI? 17-13?|pg||
pc|sT|nt|wilkinsona: well I suppose partner may have bid spades, but may go to 6 clubs now|pg||
nt|roswolf: YUP|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|h3|nt|dburn: cultured sequence by Derek Patterson - this is a good effort|pg||
nt|eamongall: Not like the recent Junior Camrose when 30 imps materialized on the last pair of boards sending the trophy to Scotland |pg||
nt|jbgood: Crouches seem to score on more than one field|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hJ|nt|brolucius: 4NT presumably asked for a minor-suit choice. When followed by 6@C, this showed a strong preference for clubs. It was a fine sequence.|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|roswolf: scheduled re-start in 25 mins approx|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|pc|c3|pc|d5|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Yes, 17-13 to NI vs ROI|pg||
pc|hT|nt|dburn: may be going for the elimination line, playing South for everything (@hA, @cQ)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.bridgewebs.com/cgi-bin/bwma/display.cgi?pid=display_page5&club=bangorholidaycongress&sessid=545753491721727|pg||
nt|eamongall: there is approximately 1 foot in the difference in the heights of these two Peter Crouches |pg||
pc|d3|nt|Walddk2: Now you can do your own calculations|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|roswolf: ?|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|h6|nt|vugraphzdu: claiming taking @c finesse|pg||

nt|dburn: this is OK - he will make it, but on a trump lead, maybe he would not have done|pg||
nt|roswolf: well 12 imps back|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: suppose its not easy to lead a trump, so well done England here|pg||
nt|dburn: best slam probably 6@d by West, but that was hard to arrange - 6@d by East tricky on a heart lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzdu: N thinking...|pg||
