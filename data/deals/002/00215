nt|aconterno: this can be the hand of the match|pg||
nt|kareno: No kidding.  That swings the lead back to Bennett.|pg||

nt|poohbear: if the defense shifts to @D then declarer can set up a opitch in that suit|pg||

nt|poohbear: Larsen is Chris Larsen who can often be found playing on BBO:)|pg||
nt|kareno: There are those who believe (as I do) that 55 is too young for 'senior' events - after all, most of the AB|pg||
nt|ritong: although, chris is an eminent BBO member|pg||
nt|kareno: ACBL membership fit into that category!!|pg||
nt|ritong: perfect gentleman|pg||
nt|poohbear: well according to the WBF that is the age|pg||
nt|kareno: That doesn't change my opinion.  I was among the youngsters when I started playing bridge and I'm still among the younger players I believe, at 63.  Don't tell anyone, though :)|pg||
nt|ritong: we won t|pg||
nt|poohbear: so it would be wrong to deprive people of the ability to play in a world championship|pg||
nt|kareno: No, it would be right to increase the minimum age for seniors.|pg||
nt|poohbear: As long as it matched the WBF age|pg||
nt|poohbear: Otherwise it is restraint of trade|pg||
