nt|vugraph187: In the other semifinal India Blues leading by 31 IMP over Railways B|pg||
nt|vugraph187: Here we hav Railways A|pg||
nt|vugraph187: Railways fielded 3 teams and all 3 came ypto Quarter Final |pg||

nt|bobbyrao:  Match is about to start|pg||
nt|vugraph187: Teams hav taken their place|pg||
nt|vugraph187: we r just waiting for the 1st played Bd|pg||
nt|bobbyrao: The first deal is a slam deal- even a try for 7 is possible if lack of SQ can not be shown in bidding|pg||
nt|drkvas: 6sp seems to be the par or 6nt maybe the par lets seeif they reach it|pg||
nt|key1809: Welcome to the 3rd set of Semi-finals between Railways A v/s Nalco|pg||
nt|panja: We will begin the third session with a slam!!|pg||
nt|vugraph187: Hopefully|pg||
nt|panja: 13 tricks are there double dummy, however, with the @SQ out, the slam does not have a good percentage|pg||
nt|key1809: yes,shd b easily reached and made|pg||
nt|panja: nor will the Declarer make it in normal course, normal play would be to cash one top Spade, and finesse later.|pg||
nt|panja: this is where RKC, Roman Key card asking is most helpful|pg||
nt|key1809: ew will try and settle for mini slam, once know trump Q missing|pg||
nt|panja: I am sure EW will find out that @SQ is out, and stop in 6|pg||
nt|drkvas: the good old 5nt for trump honours is also good enough|pg||
nt|vugraph187: The Bd has come|pg||

mb|p|nt|drkvas: iagree|pg||
