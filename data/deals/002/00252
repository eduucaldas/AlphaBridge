nt|Walddk2: If you play the suit correctly you should only lose 1 trick|pg||
nt|panja: entries might be an issue|pg||
mb|1H|nt|Walddk2: Low to the king is right with  Ax    Qx    or   Axx    Q     But since  Ax   Qx   is as likely as   Qx   Ax  you should disregard that and look at which singleton South may have|pg||
mb|2H|mb|4D|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Much more likely that it's a small rather than the queen|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|mb|d|mb|5H|nt|maj_iyer: So it is not 4@H at all|pg||
