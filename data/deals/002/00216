mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kareno: Feldman's nickname is Flash, mainly because he is noted for slow play.  When we've asked him what he's thinking about, his reply has always been, "I'm thinking about every board I ...|pg||

nt|kareno: rise with KTx and hope he misguesses).|pg||
nt|ritong 1: we could have an interesting @d handling here|pg||

pc|s7|pc|s8|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h6|pc|h9|pc|hK|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|kareno: But with east passing over 1@s I think it plays automatically even if Bramley rises with the queen on the first play.|pg||
nt|ritong 1: for the art:)|pg||
nt|kareno: Well, our kibitzers should learn to play the Queen in such a situation to make it harder for declarer.|pg||
nt|ritong 1: true.|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2N|an| |nt|aconterno: a misfit hand here|pg||
mb|3C|mb|d|mb|p|mb|3H!|nt|kareno: Note the expert bid of 1@h by north.  First overcall, then double later with a good suit and values.  That's the modern practice and I think it's best.|pg||

mb|p|mb|3S!|nt|aconterno: Dbl was 4 or 5 @s|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D!|mb|p|mb|5C!|nt|kareno: I tend to devalue a 4-4-4-1 or 5-4-4 hand.  They just don't play as well as their high cards indicate.|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraph7: it was -- and he explained it to chris as such|pg||

nt|tsanders: This is the Semi finals of the Reisinger. There arre still 26 team left to play today, which will probably be 2 boards vs each team.|pg||

nt|kareno: The late, great Edgar Kaplan remarked often that you do best to take out partner's takeout doubles and leave in his penalty doubles.|pg||

mb|1H|nt|kareno: BAM is the ultimate form of Matchpoint scoring. |pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: It is most important not to step out and put boards at risk.. most often they will be won or lost on better defense/declarer play.|pg||
