nt|mrdct: south just needs to hand on to his @Ss|pg||

nt|by: NTU needs a revoke|pg||
nt|noeye: tied score,who wins?|pg||
nt|by: I don't know, there is a tie-break rule|pg||
nt|mrdct: one would usually expect some overtime boards|pg||
nt|by: smart of north not to double|pg||
nt|mrdct: of course making 9 tricks here is no picnic|pg||
nt|mrdct: bugger is certainly taking his time|pg||
nt|mrdct: he may attack the @H suit early|pg||
nt|noeye: now E may regret that the 4H defense in the early Board 20,if they lose 1 IMP|pg||
nt|mrdct: NTU may also regret the 7@H hand that cost them 26 imps|pg||

nt|by: he takes 4@c 4@s @h and @d for an overtrick|pg||
nt|mrdct: might make 4@C, 4@S and 2@H|pg||
nt|mrdct: i hope the organisers have some overtime boards prepared!|pg||
nt|by: bugger would not be blamed if he does not make the overtrick, I think|pg||
nt|mrdct: and more importantly a hand data file to run the vugraph|pg||
nt|mrdct: 630 for EW will give then 10 imps and tie the match for any later-comers|pg||
nt|noeye: ok,now How about the tie-break rule|pg||
nt|mrdct: i'm told the organisers are looking around for the tie-break rule right now|pg||
nt|jmchen: if tie, then NTU loses|pg||
nt|by: in that case it does not matter :(|pg||
nt|jmchen: yeah|pg||
nt|by: wait, are they counting total points or winning number of boards?|pg||
nt|mrdct: is that because there are some decimal places in the carryover figure?|pg||
nt|jmchen: NCTU has more winning boards|pg||
nt|mrdct: unusual tie-splitting method - i prefer extra boards|pg||
nt|by: but the official rule is total points?|pg||
nt|jmchen: no time for play-off|pg||
nt|jmchen: they did look at the handbook of the tournament|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c9|pc|cT|nt|reisig: more reason to drop the @c K|pg||
nt|kareno: West known not to have both high @d honors (would have led one).|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|ritong: @c king is in bad position now|pg||
nt|kareno: AND the Rabbi's Rule (the King of @c is always singleton) :-)|pg||
nt|ritong: makes two good reasons to drop it:)|pg||
nt|vugraph7: Levin is asking about EWs 2-level opening bids|pg||
nt|vugraph7: 2@D = 5+ @ds -- if only 5@D then also 4@C.  2@H/@S are natural weak 2s|pg||
nt|ritong: maybe levin has a feeling he can achieve all even with the @c Kx..|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|mrdct: with the amount of time bugger takes to play one hand, it is no wonder there is no time for a play-off|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sT|pc|sJ|pc|s4|pg||
nt|reisig: Board-a Match makes all these tricks meaningful|pg||

pc|dJ|nt|mrdct: !K would be bad|pg||
nt|mrdct: @DK|pg||
nt|by: yes, but how could it win to cover?|pg||
nt|mrdct: @DQ to win the match|pg||
nt|mrdct: assuming bugger doesn't cover|pg||
nt|noeye: 430 is  10 IMP|pg||
nt|by: he will really be buggered if he does|pg||
nt|by: to use an aussie expression|pg||
nt|mrdct: i've seem some slow delcarers in my time - but i think bugger takes the cake|pg||
nt|mrdct: it's no wonder there's "bugger-all" time to play extra boards|pg||
nt|noeye: I think the board play time can make me dinner and take a bath|pg||
nt|mrdct: one fears that the longer he thinks about this the more likely he is to cover|pg||
nt|by: north already has @hAQJ and @cK ............... and is a passed hand|pg||
nt|mrdct: i didn't make a note of the time - but it feels like this has taken at least 20 minutes (so far)|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|nt|mrdct: he gets what he deserves|pg||
nt|mrdct: a well earned win for NCTU|pg||
