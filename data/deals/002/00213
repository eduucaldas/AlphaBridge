nt|ritong 1: we could have an interesting @d handling here|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|kareno: Note the expert bid of 1@h by north.  First overcall, then double later with a good suit and values.  That's the modern practice and I think it's best.|pg||

mb|p|nt|kareno: Looks like another 3NT unless e/w get frisky.|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1H|nt|poohbear: we will see if NS can penalize|pg||
nt|kareno: If they have a major-suited two bid, then they'd better pick spades!!|pg||
nt|tsanders: if EW get too frisky with 19 major cards, it might be bloody|pg||
mb|d|mb|2H|nt|tsanders: 10, not 19|pg||
mb|2S|nt|kareno: Does Kwiecien feel the hot breath on his shoulder and can he run?|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|kareno: I believe 2@h showed a two-suited hand including hearts.|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraph7: I put the alert in:|pg||
nt|vugraph7: weak with 5@H and any other suit|pg||
mb|p|pc|h3|pc|hQ|pc|hK|nt|vugraph7: (if a bid gets alerted, I try to type in the explanation if I can make it out)|pg||
nt|kareno: That's a much better spot than 2@h was because of the suit breaks.|pg||
nt|tsanders: east hoping other suit was a minor|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|poohbear: declarer  goal is to take 7 tricks on this hand|pg||
nt|vugraph7: the round was just called --- going to be behind again|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sQ|pc|s9|nt|kareno: He has to try to keep the penalty below game - 500 will be a probable loss.|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|h4|nt|poohbear: he does have 3 spades at least 1 heart and 2 well placed minor suit kings |pg||
nt|kareno: North knows south can ruff the next low heart and take out the dummy's trump.|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hT|nt|kareno: N/S have just enough to get 500.|pg||

pc|s7|pc|s6|pc|h5|nt|kareno: Easy defense.  Good outcome for N/S.|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|d3|nt|poohbear: and a board not likely to be duplicated cause North will probably open 1 heart at the other table|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dA|nt|kareno: This result came about because of e/w's defensive bidding methods.|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|kareno: Best not underlead the diamond or the good result will be lost!|pg||

nt|poohbear: Well Bizon caught a totally worthless dummy and is still taking 6 tricks|pg||
