mb|4D!|nt|Gerben42: 2@C is a tricky bid, now S will think his hand is worse than it is|pg||
nt|Gerben42: playing 2/1 I guess 1NT followed by 4@S is better|pg||
nt|mcphee: well that could lead to a missed slam|pg||

nt|MolvaM: well 3@s is promising|pg||
nt|eleni: so far so good up to now:) good players play the correct contracts in both tables:)|pg||
nt|lelos: hard to find @d lead also|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: stop at5 4@S|pg||
nt|chick: the main reason hearts play better is the bad spade split ... EW cannot discover that in the auction|pg||
mb|4S|nt|eleni: a most aggressive bid:) at the other table, E-W are simply at 2NT|pg||
nt|eleni: the lead was also a @h|pg||
nt|eleni: John is thinking very long and he is right|pg||

pc|c2|pc|cT|nt|mcphee: can actually manage 11 tricks here for a decent score|pg||

pc|c6|nt|eleni: Please be with us, tomorrow at 17:00 CET and Sunday 9:30CET|pg||
pc|s2|nt|MolvaM: @d finesse is not extremely risky as he can discard his @h loser even if @d finesse loses|pg||
nt|eleni: yes zoh, a @h return would have been killing|pg||
nt|Gerben42: no entries for @C@D squeeze|pg||
nt|mcphee: @h yes a better defence, but with right view nothing matters|pg||
nt|MolvaM: he needs friendly breaks in all suits though|pg||
nt|mcphee: @D hook cash A, @H to hand and ruff @D loser|pg||
nt|mcphee: draw trumps and claim|pg||

nt|eleni: 9@s and let it ride...........|pg||
nt|cicus: this is not a good line anyway, a @D should have dbeen ducked first|pg||
nt|haans: ruff 1 more spade = dummy reversal|pg||
nt|chick: but if he draws trump loses another club instead|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mcphee: can ruff @C good but still needs to finesse @D|pg||

nt|Gerben42: 1@D is almost a psyche *g|pg||
nt|eleni: a 75% score for our Ladies here, one can say|pg||

nt|mcphee: if they play usdca S carded wrong|pg||
nt|MolvaM: if udca, then south must have liked the @c shift. hence north continued the attack|pg||
nt|MolvaM: so north is innocent|pg||
nt|eleni: he might have false carded though, just to mic up the girls|pg||

nt|cicus: has to decide if @Hs are 4-4 or @S finesse is on|pg||
nt|haans: but spade finesse|pg||
nt|cicus: @Ds, I mean|pg||
nt|cicus: 4-4|pg||
pc|h9|nt|harmon: If declarer plays a high club from his hand south shd drop Q|pg||
pc|h4|nt|petrosa: Q@h|pg||
nt|petrosa: and many -|pg||
nt|liarakos: maybe x @H and many down|pg||
nt|cicus: if @D5 led, it strongly suggests a 5-card suit|pg||
nt|haans: playing will take time|pg||
pc|hA|nt|eleni: George you are right, Nick Perdikaris is an aggressive player:)|pg||
nt|ghionis: :)|pg||
nt|eleni: but in this case he decided to use the law of total tricks|pg||
nt|eleni: and it will work|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|cicus: because of rule of 11|pg||
nt|haans: @D4 = five cards|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|MolvaM: yes we are surprised :)|pg||
nt|eleni: true, this is why on board 16 they lost an IMP|pg||
pc|hK|nt|tez: 1 down|pg||
nt|mcphee: things lay well for declarer|pg||
nt|liarakos: 5@H x in the open|pg||
pc|h8|nt|eleni: a wild bidding:)|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|liarakos: -2 probably so 11 imps to Levi|pg||
nt|cicus: on the run of @Cs S will have to find discards, however|pg||
nt|haans: specially attention to J and 10|pg||
nt|chick: being doubled does have that effect :)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mcphee: W overstepped hi bounds with this 4@S bid|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|nt|mcphee: good point, but as @D run nothing helps|pg||
nt|eleni: 3dx=|pg||
nt|harmon: true I just pointed it out cause Stevo did that to me to beat me, I almost got it right cause it was Stevo|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|eleni: not this board:):) that was for the operator of the other table:):) board 5@h|pg||
nt|eleni: in the open room E-W on this one scored +1 for 450|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|tez: w shld not decide here|pg||
nt|mcphee: not sure what he was thinking, but this is not what you do|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s5|nt|MolvaM: now we know that west is a certified overbidder|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hQ|pc|h7|nt|haans: some say attiude lead better at nt for not tell if 4-4 of 5-3 in suit|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|ghionis: bad timing for altinis he went down in this|pg||
pc|sT|nt|mcphee: so reccomended is Q@C now not 10:)|pg||
nt|harmon: rofl yup|pg||
nt|jcone: no chance of Queen play now|pg||
nt|mcphee: which would have a good shot had he overcalled:)|pg||
nt|lelos: another 4 imps for altinis here since 9 tricks are easy|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|liarakos: oops|pg||
nt|cicus: I agree|pg||
pc|s6|pc|h2|pg||
nt|rodal f: ? Kill the cat. And @S|pg||
nt|lelos: not very carefull play by coach|pg||
pc|h5|nt|tez: with a bal hand with  defensive values in @d and limit opening hand|pg||
nt|MolvaM: they are sweet ladies remember|pg||
nt|Gerben42: I guess east had an opinion about 4@H|pg||
pc|d3|nt|cicus: and 4th best does not tell the quality of the suit, making a switch harder|pg||
pc|d4|nt|MolvaM: so they expect their opps to be polite in defence|pg||
nt|eleni: no way to save the -1:(|pg||
nt|bmkl: -2 maybe|pg||
nt|bmkl: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: Thanks all, see you in about 15 min :)           @H|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|eleni: true, he had to continue with a @s|pg||
nt|haans: sort of squeeze|pg||
pc|c4|nt|cicus: S could have pitched a spade but then all @S are high|pg||
nt|haans: do not need finesse in spades|pg||
nt|cicus: E probably went for @Hs|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: director signed the score on the 6th board|pg||
nt|haans: good defense|pg||
pc|c2|nt|vugraphzge: Thats all for now. See you in about 15 min|pg||

mb|1D!|nt|eleni: hi Thanasi|pg||
nt|cicus: 3@S?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: yes|pg||
nt|cicus: uhh, I would feel terrible in EW shoes|pg||
mb|p|nt|liarakos: only 3N here|pg||
mb|1H|nt|mcphee: 1@C?|pg||
nt|maj_gr:  hello|pg||
nt|rodal f: a 10IMPer out the window when NS got there chance|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: polish?|pg||
nt|eleni: @h@h we must point out that the young lady in South, Christine Syrakopoulou, is an excellent player|pg||
nt|lelos: 2@s intermidiate|pg||
nt|petrosa: the bidding system of levi-stavrinos is not perfect|pg||
nt|petrosa: they play 3NT|pg||
nt|cicus: a pity we don't know what happened|pg||
mb|2D|nt|mcphee: they are Greeks:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|petrosa: -2 but you never know:)|pg||
nt|haans: assume x was negative |pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: I'll try to find out when I have time|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mcphee: ahh transfer bids:)|pg||

nt|eleni: how very true Bob:) All of them are Greeks:):)|pg||
nt|haans: pass 6+|pg||
nt|cicus: yes, denying points :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|harmon: how young|pg||
nt|petrosa: in 3@C|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: hard to believe N would balance 3@C atht eh other table|pg||
nt|mcphee: here N was more tuned in that e/w may not fit so well|pg||
nt|jcone: Edgar   is 30   young enough?|pg||
mb|p|nt|harmon: Im an old goat just checking|pg||
nt|eleni: a little older than Christine:)|pg||
nt|mcphee: quite the lead|pg||
nt|petrosa: they didn't find the double fit, nor the slam|pg||
pc|c2|nt|vugraphzge: paizoume twra thn 39, meta thn 38 :)|pg||
nt|cicus: bd6 suggested EW were playing natural system but now it seems I was wrong and it's a strong club|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c3|nt|petrosa: afterall they have only 30hcp|pg||
nt|eleni: At the other table, on board 19, Judy Levi plays 3NT, so yes, some IMPs for Chliapas|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|mcphee: poor W now has a problem|pg||
nt|mcphee: no cost as it happens|pg||
nt|eleni: a good save in 6@d|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mcphee: he should have just overcalled 1@S and be done with it|pg||
pc|d4|nt|tez: suspicious dbl by west with singleton @h|pg||
nt|eleni: oh ok:) As Effie told us, they picked up board 39, before 38:)|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d9|pg||
nt|mcphee: yes, it was lucky N bid|pg||
nt|polyvlakas: this should be an easy board....with a diffirent bidding|pg||
nt|eleni: and a bad X|pg||
nt|bmkl: nice agressive bid by Fotis|pg||
nt|cicus: can't be either (no X from west)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|rodal f: A good shot but only for a push|pg||
nt|cicus: so I am totally in the dark|pg||
nt|haans: this is good bridge Strong clubs and opps bid game|pg||
pc|h3|pc|dQ|nt|mcphee: or E would be bidding @H|pg||
nt|haans: will lose imps here|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mcphee: S needs to find a @C now|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hA|nt|petrosa: when the two pairs play the same suit, someone is wrong|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: about the 6th board:wrong explanations given at the table. not sure of details|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: sorry that there was 3S for a while, it's 5|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|eleni: yes, but I can not guess what E-W would have done, had Karlaftis bid 6@d|pg||
nt|haans: Trommel do not understand that play|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|cicus: oh, I see, you were joking with us :)|pg||
nt|cicus: is this real?|pg||
nt|cicus: west ducked @S10?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: I'm sorry I lost this game|pg||
nt|cicus: no problem|pg||
nt|haans: not really|pg||
pc|hK|nt|eleni: let's hope Maria Panagaki won't return a @c|pg||
nt|cicus: normal result|pg||
pc|hJ|mc|11|nt|MolvaM: defence dropped a few tricks here|pg||
nt|mcphee: W refused to lead a @S and now it will cost him big time|pg||
nt|bmkl: they are vulnerable|pg||
nt|eleni: exactly but I suppose this will be a swing|pg||
nt|chick: maybe trying to unblock for his partner?   but it certainly went wrong this time|pg||

mb|3H|nt|snorris: 5@s+ a minor?|pg||
nt|jcwla: This looks like @S and a minor and W has a pretty good idea which minor it might be.|pg||
nt|snorris: -3 this one|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@H presumably NF - a useful agreement|pg||
nt|snorris: 3@hs |pg||
nt|snorris: no -2|pg||
nt|rodal f: Must be that Sorri but are EW at trouble?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rodal f: We see the cards. STILL it smell a X from S here.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Should have a way to get out in responder's own suit over a double.  One way over standard weak twos followed by X is the so-called "Parking Lot Redouble."  The weak two bidder ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: must (if RHO passes) bid the cheapest suit, which partner then passes or corrects.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|snorris: 3nt can be won n-s but might not be bid |pg||
pc|s5|pc|h6|pc|h7|pg||

pc|s2|pc|sQ|pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|snorris: @h lead gave one trick away so -1 only..thats good for e-w|pg||
nt|jcwla: In this way can retain the "McCabe" meaning for a direct suit bid over the double: "I'm raising your preempt suit, but if you're on opening lead, lead this instead."|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s8|nt|rodal f: 3NT they was not near to bid after the EW bidds, byt a X. HUM|pg||

nt|eleni: in West|pg||
nt|tez: if one makes a mistake it can be costly but when opps follow suit it can always neutralize|pg||
nt|eleni: at the open table just a 3@c+1|pg||
nt|lelos: not this one :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Thanassis:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: Last board for today. See you tommorow :)|pg||
nt|maj_gr:  a lost opp for EW in other room|pg||
nt|petrosa: usally it is not good habit to lead A in no trump without good suit|pg||
nt|ghionis: terrible result i think|pg||
nt|cicus: I apologize for disturbing you|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: possible failing slam here|pg||
nt|ghionis: they have to wait for Argyrou result now|pg||
nt|cicus: good result for NS in OR|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
mb|1N|nt|mcphee: 6@S has a slight chance|pg||
nt|haans: easy make in 3nt (@H lead)|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: a nice slam hand|pg||
nt|eleni: indeed Bod and so did the other table 6@h-1|pg||
nt|mcphee: but any slam should fail|pg||
nt|mcphee: 6@S also fails, but it is a better spot than 6@H|pg||
nt|harmon: 1h -4c shd avoid slam|pg||
nt|mcphee: geee harmon, it would not stop me|pg||
nt|harmon: well nuttin stops you|pg||
nt|mcphee: too many controls in s hand|pg||
nt|maj_gr:  they should be in 6, playing Polish club|pg||

nt|cicus: ah they have the methods here as well|pg||
mb|p|nt|eleni: provided they want to Tez:):)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 2@c must include 19-20 NT|pg||
nt|tez: 2@c 18 19 bal or..|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 2@H is puzzling *g|pg||
nt|harmon: shd get to 5h|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: or south is overbidding :)|pg||
nt|petrosa: in 19 4@H Dbl|pg||
nt|lelos: very good slam|pg||
nt|polyvlakas: without the 2 queens, it would be a normal vurnerable weak2|pg||
nt|haans: or not :)|pg||
nt|cicus: 5@C is only down on the unlikely @D lead|pg||
pc|hK|nt|Gerben42: ah - transfer|pg||
nt|rodal f: Been nice to meet u. See u tomorrow at 17.00CET|pg||
nt|eleni: right Thanasi, 6 are there all the time, so let us see if Fotis and Aris will get there|pg||
nt|maj_gr:  the strong hand finds out 5-5-2-1 in West and there is a play even with 0 points|pg||
nt|haans: good cards in spade|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mcphee: yee old mexican 2@D|pg||
nt|MolvaM: the inventor of transfer bids must be rich with all the copyright money he gets|pg||
nt|jcone: 2 @C  game force|pg||
nt|mcphee: must be some form of gazilli|pg||
nt|petrosa: in the open room|pg||
nt|lelos: hmm|pg||
nt|rodal f: Pass and 10 tricks on RD|pg||
nt|haans: sure|pg||
pc|s6|nt|Gerben42: 6@C seems nice|pg||
nt|lelos: not even in 3:)|pg||
nt|maj_gr:  difficult to get there with natural system|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|tez: 6@c is perfect|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 3@D must show @C then?!|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 6nt is more exciting|pg||
nt|Gerben42: I'm right - getting the hang of this|pg||
nt|harmon: Im told NS play the nunes/fantoni system|pg||
nt|petrosa: not 3NT |pg||
pc|s2|nt|jcone: the Double should put brakes on|pg||
nt|petrosa: it is easier if you know 52 cards|pg||
nt|liarakos: -1 so 19-9 to Capa final|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|MolvaM: we want slams that make on a finesse, squeeze, throw-in etc|pg||
nt|mcphee: wow, 4@H opposite a GF strikes me as a very poor bid|pg||
nt|harmon: north doesnt have enuff to move|pg||
nt|petrosa: with clubs 2-2 slam is good:)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|haans: not easier to find|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|ghionis: @S lead to go down|pg||
nt|cicus: lead quite sensible|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mcphee: my lord|pg||
pc|dA|nt|MolvaM: not very enterprising|pg||
nt|mcphee: N did all he could I suppose|pg||
nt|mcphee: the strong hand bids like they have nothing, the weak hand pressed on with key card:)|pg||
pc|d6|nt|cicus: looked like N was short in @Ds|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|MolvaM: maybe because they play against the president|pg||
nt|tez: and 6 nt with open hands|pg||
nt|lelos: i like a 3@c reopenig with maestro's hand|pg||

nt|animeshraj: this cant be a NF 4@C|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d5|nt|mcphee: well maria is going to be unhappy this goes down|pg||
nt|mcphee: she asked if parnter held Q of trumps, and then bid slam anyway:)|pg||
nt|mcphee: must be in hope of a low @D lead|pg||
nt|fabsayc: missing 4 trumps including queen you are still more than 50% to make|pg||
pc|dT|nt|eleni: well, Christine can do magic and put to sleep opps:)|pg||
nt|polyvlakas: protonotar did not overcall |pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|petrosa: after the cue 4@C is forcing|pg||
nt|eleni: weird interpretation by Fotis Skoularikis|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|lelos: we will discuss this hand monday|pg||
nt|eleni: in the other table they were left in their 3NT:(|pg||
nt|petrosa: 3NT is better than 4@C|pg||
nt|animeshraj: with souths hand i dont think he wld play NT|pg||
nt|animeshraj: or want to..|pg||
nt|animeshraj: very nicely thought out by him,,, and he was well on his way to  .. glory|pg||
nt|eleni: As at the open table was said, the round ended up 26-20 for Judy Levi's team and 17-13VPs|pg||
pc|h7|nt|tez: 5@c+4@h+2@d+1@s|pg||
nt|mcphee: if W continues @d there is a chance at success|pg||
nt|harmon: if d played and E lazy she can make|pg||
pc|s3|nt|eleni: this is true:):)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: really? shows how good the club is|pg||
nt|bmkl: very clever line by Fotis :)|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|s8|nt|mcphee: it is hard to find any fault with the auction|pg||
nt|Gerben42: but can understnad 3NT bid after pd shows my two short suits|pg||
nt|eleni: The boys are not members of her club:)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: south hopes that @d finesse is off and everyone else gets a @s lead|pg||
nt|mcphee: perhaps S with such good @C could advance with 4@C, but at pairs this seems not that wise|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: Thats all for now|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: Thanks all, see you in about 15 min :)|pg||

nt|mcphee: @S slam going down 1?|pg||
nt|cicus: oh sorry I missed that, then a @D return from east spoils the squeeze|pg||
nt|chick: two more boards for today|pg||

nt|MolvaM: are they on the same wavelength regarding the number of keycards?|pg||
nt|chick: S barely has an opening hand, so will not push, but N might|pg||
mb|4N|nt|mcphee: N should go|pg||
mb|5S|nt|mcphee: just not the right day for it|pg||

nt|chick: next 'suit' up shows 2 keycards|pg||
nt|chick: although I prefer DEPO above 5 of our suit|pg||

pc|c3|pc|c4|pc|c9|pg||

pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|sA|nt|haans: we in Sweden did learn about DOPI 1971 when i was just a beginner|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|mcphee: E could have bid 5@C maybe|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|vugraphzge: smal break|pg||
nt|MolvaM: even @d suit 4-3 would be sufficient to make it against a club lead I guess|pg||
nt|MolvaM: so a very cruel distribution|pg||
nt|mcphee: at last Mom arrives |pg||
nt|mcphee: 2 tops for n/w and one score where pairs might fail in 4@H brought home bye good play from S|pg||
nt|mcphee: surely this will give n/s a little boost in morale|pg||
