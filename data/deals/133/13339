mb|5H|nt|harmon: they bid a game on finesse not worth discussing|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no double from East, not expecting West to contribute much to the defence|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Right solution|pg||
nt|hawe45:  A trump-lead would - as almost always is the case - kill the contract, IÂ´m sure|pg||
nt|dutcho: Might be poor choice of words Bill|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|nt|panja: something wrong here..|pg||

nt|panja: oh, I thought @D7 was led....|pg||
nt|panja: wasn't that the card that was showing earlier?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: it was a combination of bad light and misclick :-)|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: North might have to neutralize dummy's diamonds by playing 3 rounds of the suit|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|nt|Vugraphzfb: Sorry, I was trying to get the other match fixed, hope I succeeded|pg||
nt|sharkey: So Zimmermann will regain the lead|pg||

nt|panja: @ST..boosts it to an easy make|pg||
pc|d5|nt|chessmaste: Now he must play a trump|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|panja: the problem for W is, he has too much strength in @H..and he now knows E is short|pg||
nt|sharkey: This is the final session of the semi finals - 14 boards to go|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d9|nt|chessmaste: leaving declarer a trick short|pg||
nt|jcwla: One often leads a trump against preference auctions.  Here, E has preferred @D's over @S's with the pass of 2@D.  However, N's weak @S length suggested a different lead to him.|pg||

nt|Walddk2: The defence has time for the spade switch|pg||
nt|xenya: indifferent contract in the other room, where S decided to balance over 1NT |pg||
nt|Walddk2: There is a theory that you should lead a major on an auction like this|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If so, @SA seems fair|pg||
nt|rhelle: certainly a good case for it; it clarifies the defence really early|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not the king if that asks for an unblock in your methods|pg||

nt|rhelle: it's hard to visualise 5@s opposite|pg||
nt|rhelle: a @d looks safe|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Setting up a diamond winner now I presume, but my predictions are horrible today, so ...|pg||
nt|rhelle: the way I play that, is that the highest honour promises the 2 below|pg||

nt|vugraphzgq: don't think so, try to find out|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@S natural? ( I have two spades..)|pg||
nt|panja: this must be 4@H and 5 minor..|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: 4/5@H no 4@S inv.|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: is what Drijver wrote as explanation|pg||
nt|panja: y, that seems the appropriate one|pg||
nt|mdgraham: unusual to set up a game force with only 7 hcp opposite 15-17, but I guess AK109x is a good suit|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|kareno: Good stop.  |pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: if this is invitational I must have an out-of-date CC for EW.|pg||

nt|hawe45:  In the good old days, brave men would invite (maybe) with this East-hand|pg||
mb|2D|nt|vugraphzgq: they are constantly working on their system|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, this is jolly good, thinks South|pg||
nt|panja: but after all this complicated construct, all that they have managed to achieve is to play in a 43 fit at a rather high level|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Netherlands, near Vorden|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Four pairs in each team. We have four of them at our visible tables (open and closed room) and another four at two "invisible" tables in order to give new operators some practise|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: their 2@C is different: either 6+@C, 10-15, or 5+@S, 4+@c|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - with the suit 6-0 against them - good luck|pg||
nt|mdgraham: as a matter of doing the job, we download available CC s when we can - but as we have seen there, players do change systems and the CC's can get out-of-date.  |pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: sry I don't have an up-to-date one too|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|vugraphzgq: Jansma has shown any weak NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|chessmaste: I wonder why West did not reopen with a double?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sharkey: Zimmermann originally seeded 16 (now 1); Strul originally 12 (5)|pg||
nt|sharkey: For seeding brackets http://www.acbl.org/nabc/brackets/2010/01/vanderbilt/|pg||
nt|kareno: Seems like Strul was underseeded.|pg||
nt|kareno: Zimmermann too|pg||
nt|rodal f: Non of them surpriced me. Some might remember Zimmerman in Rio.|pg||
nt|sharkey: hard to seed when you look at the start list|pg||
nt|harmon: they probably need to change the seeding with so many european players now coming to nationals|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Khven was just mucking around with 2@D - unfortunately, his opps turned nasty|pg||
pc|dK|nt|hlortz: yes the ACB|pg||
nt|hlortz: acbl seeding formula not good for foreign pairs always|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mdgraham: South possibly afraid of 3NT, and too happy with 3@H to double - still, if EW were going to bid 3NT they would have done |pg||

pc|d4|pc|d2|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|sharkey: On the two tables in this match the US players are not present|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d7|nt|kareno: Yes, ACBL needs to account for some of the foreign teams which have had good results elsewhere.|pg||
nt|sharkey: Four world champiuons this table|pg||
nt|panja: the problem is how do you assess 'good results elsewhere'?|pg||
nt|panja: with a 5422 hand and just 7 HCP.....what is the % that 1nt is the best spot? Quite high, I would think!!|pg||

nt|jcwla: The equivalent of the LOL bids of "4NT I do" and "4NT I don't" -- meaning I do or don't mean it as Blackwood.|pg||
nt|panja: 7@h here?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  even 8 - @H are 3-3|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: natural i.e. 21-23 bal, 3@C asks distribution|pg||
pc|h6|nt|Vugraphzfb: Yes, when they sat down and I said that Saelinsminde wouldn't fit in the BBO name box, one of them suggested I just do Silla :)|pg||
nt|chessmaste: West might have done better to bid spades at some point - even 2@S was possible - then the double fit comes to light|pg||
nt|hawe45:  OK with that range, they bid the slam for sure|pg||
nt|panja: that is, can make 13 tricks in @H....no expectation of it being bid though|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 7@H cold on 3-3 hearts - don't think they will bid that, though :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: Well, they have steered their way into a 4-3 @H fit once this set.|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Sjoert is counting steps on his fingers|pg||

nt|vugraphzgq: and Dubinin too :-)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  ThatÂ´s what happens, when you bid 1 @H with this West-hand|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Safety?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfb: Helness: "nice" Silla: "nice" - different intonations, sorry I can't do them|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Forcing.,..?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But still no 9 tricks|pg||
nt|mdgraham: @H10 lead would be an easy set (East must get in with @CK) but a low heart is reasonable  |pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: all results on http://www.nbbportal.nl/7024/clubcompetitie_2.html|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|hJ|nt|sharkey: Are they convering in English at the table Jan?|pg||
nt|sharkey: conversing*|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Mostly in Norwegian, but that was English - don't know if it's the same word|pg||
nt|hawe45:  With a decent @H-suit in West, all @H-lead works|pg||
nt|dutcho: neither do I actually|pg||
pc|h2|nt|Vugraphzfb: They also call the cards in Norwegian, so I have to watch the dummy|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mdgraham: South knows that North is limited by the non-strong 1@C opening  |pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: short break as the late lunch arrived and players make their choice from the rolls|pg||
nt|mdgraham: a bit unlucky, really. @HAKQ wasted|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|dutcho: this will be interesting|pg||
nt|bjacobs: In a way, the lower 2@H bid is more dangerous than the higher 2@S bid|pg||
pc|d7|nt|sharkey: Dont have "nice" in Norwegian - or anything close...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: There is no word for nice in Norwegian|pg||
nt|Walddk4: :)|pg||
nt|hlortz: the truth comes out!|pg||
nt|panja: N playing for doubleton @CH with E|pg||
nt|jcwla: 9 more to Russia on 4 - where EW here played 3@H-2, S in the OR played 2@H-2.|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: all pairs rotate on the different teams for the selector wants to see how the different combinations score|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: So every round 'Nederland 1' plays against 'Rusland 1' but the teams may or may not contain the same players|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: W still thinking|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This layout was not a whole lot away from a re-opening double by West, passed by East, for a large number|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sharkey: yes there is Roland - may be not in Danish|pg||
pc|d3|nt|chessmaste: It looks odd, but given that South was a pased hand should North prefer 2NT to 3@D?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: egg and bacon for me please |pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|dutcho: both x and 3@C are possible rebids with west|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s3|nt|dburn:  well, North didnt have to bid on - he might conclude that South would not have @cA or @cK since he could have bid 3NT if so|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|rodal f: Those Danich:)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: on @H void is it not difficult|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: 'spade finesse, 1 or 2 down'|pg||
pc|hK|nt|hlortz: tho trusting a Dane's comment about Norwegians.. doubtful|pg||
nt|panja: the @D duck encouraged a losing @C finesse, it seems..|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: and similar Nederland 2 vs Rusland 2|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Now an endplay against West in the red suits|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - but for 1 down|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h8|pc|s6|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: discussion of the hand, but it's in Norwegian so I can't tell you anything, sorry|pg||

mb|p|nt|rodal f: Hehehe Go on Roland and we start for full speed.|pg||

mb|p|nt|bjacobs: 1NT makes; 2@S doesn't|pg||
nt|dutcho: I was wrong again:)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Maybe a heart lead to 1NT would prove me wrong as well|pg||
pc|h7|nt|dutcho: well good look by Gert-Jan Paulissen|pg||
pc|h9|nt|panja: NS hold the balance of strength, however, since S has almost all, EW will come to more tricks than NS|pg||
pc|hK|nt|sharkey: Much of the Norwegian language originates from Danish - in addition we have dialect Norwegian, "nynorsk"|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Untraditional 12-14 NT|pg||

nt|dutcho: hi Bachar|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|h2|nt|chessmaste: They did not look for a major fit, so North preferred a heart to a diamond|pg||

nt|hawe45:  Seeing West unblock the @H Queen|pg||
nt|dburn:  not clear why South preferred a spade to a heart, though|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true |pg||
nt|hawe45:  Kill dummy|pg||
pc|hT|nt|bjacobs: Against 1NT passed out, it's quite a good idea to lead your stronger major, as a principle|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h5|pg||
pc|h8|pc|s4|pc|s5|pc|c2|pg||
nt|dutcho: well usually partner has several ways to bid if he has 1 or 2 majors|pg||
nt|bjacobs: East has 11 points - it's not surprising partner has passed |pg||
nt|bjacobs: So that argument tends to come more into play when opening leader is weak|pg||
nt|dutcho: that is true so maybe that is an indication why he found this|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c5|nt|rodal f: And "nynorsk" was the norwegian language, but some danes tryed to press an other language at the norwegians. Learn to play scoccer danes:)|pg||
nt|dburn:  still, North is prepared to stick with his original idea|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Is that a new Tarantinio movie?|pg||

mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 1@C=16+unbalanced, or 18+balanced|pg||
mb|2S|nt|jcwla: Kaplan/Rubens evaluated it to 13.5: http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=J75+AK+98+AT7653|pg||
mb|p|nt|chessmaste: 3NT making looks good - in the other room South led the king of diamonds!|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Just what East wanted, the bidding at 4@C by the time it got back to him|pg||
nt|chessmaste: At least he won't go down in 3NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|doctorone: yes... I think for NT to be playable, you hope for some @s support anyhow|pg||

pc|d6|nt|doctorone: welc back :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This hand is going to play like a foot|pg||
pc|dA|nt|dburn:  he wasn't all that likely to go down in 3NT, but he may well go down in this|pg||
pc|d2|nt|hawe45:  Only 3 loosers - but will that make 10 winners? I doubt it|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: 'do I need to have 10 cards in M or is 9 OK?'|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Blood round the corner|pg||
nt|panja: N has bid once too many times perhaps|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Was OK, if some of their bids had been PASS|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|dutcho: very nice defense by EW on board 8.|pg||
nt|dutcho: Jansma picked the wrong major to bid|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h2|nt|mdgraham: double by North surely shows spades - reckon 3@S by South here, and then over to West|pg||
pc|h4|nt|vugraphzgq: a rather quick pass|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but West can't double with his hand, surely, even after the redouble from East |pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|cA|nt|hlortz: 5@C would be in jeopardy if K@H in other hand|pg||
nt|rodal f: A new flatty by the nice @D layout? Or slamtry by 5@C as end?|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: Helness explaining what Helgemo has shown to Silla, but in Norwegian - I think that 3@c promised clubs and was forcing to game, but that's just from the body language|pg||
nt|sharkey: As Henry mentioned they have "rightsided" the contract so shudnt be anything to the play|pg||
nt|panja: could W have rebid 3@H on 3@D to keep alive chances of playing in 3NT? or should E have rebid 3N instead of 3@D?|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cT|nt|hawe45:  22 IMPÂ´s board 5 - when did we see that score...?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 6@Dx+1 at one table, 6@Sx+1 at the other|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Russia made a doubled slam +1 in both rooms|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Both doubling pairs lost an overtrick also|pg||

nt|rnmalik: That was some hand to think of it|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Nice score in a 10-board-match|pg||

nt|doctorone: agree, Bill. Requires work though, and these guys are certainly up to it :)|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|rodal f: Have never tested that out.|pg||

mb|p|nt|panja: or not perhaps..11 in @S too|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Helness asking Brogeland how many somethings he had last hand - maybe spades|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I was going to comment: "what contract should North be thinking of when he picks up his hand?"|pg||
nt|dutcho: I like his choice of opening bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: My answer was: "he should be thinking of 3NT"|pg||

nt|doctorone: I was thinking about N's choice here, and I like it :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And then he goes and bids it!|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Singleton kings are like a red rag to a bull.  You have visions of a low card being led from the ace, and you winning your king|pg||

pc|dK|nt|panja: to make 12 tricks..N must cash @DAK and ruff third @D...|pg||

nt|vugraphzgp: v Prooijen that is|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4NT is good raise to at least one of the minors. Partner is supposed to bid 5@C unless he has considerable extras|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Otherwise 6@C|pg||
nt|xenya: do we think S's pass is forcing?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not in my world but who knows|pg||
nt|rhelle: IF ... and it's a big IF ... 4NT shows values|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: I have been infored pass should mean he does not want to go on|pg||
nt|rhelle: then vul against not, you're committed to game - which should make pass forcing now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Ah, the Italian way|pg||
nt|rhelle: so double would mean: I want to go on|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But even if 4NT is a good raise to a minor, it does not show any defence against their contract, does it?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's an issue for all serious partnerships to discuss|pg||
nt|rhelle: true - but it does give way to a forcing pass or action double scenario|pg||
