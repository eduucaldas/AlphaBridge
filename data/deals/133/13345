nt|rhelle: this lead gives declarer a chance|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|merijng: decl in the other room played on spades|pg||
nt|rhelle: it's a classic position - when declarer plays a D to dummy, East has to produce the Q to give declarer a guess|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: Drijver explains @Ds 12-14 pts as Brink puts down dmmy he comments 11-14 with a big smie|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Will East play the @DQ on the first round?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Playing on Q10x in @d iand in front will give easy 9 tricks|pg||

nt|rhelle: but if 2 world class declarers both play @s|pg||
nt|april7: what is the better percentage play? in @S or in @D?|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s8|pc|d3|pc|s6|pg||
pc|sT|pc|h2|pc|d4|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ralfwil: @d is a better percentage with bad communications to the @s suit|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|nt|april7: W is playing @D now because he thinks that since S didn't play on @D he has only a songleton|pg||
nt|chessmaste: In isolation a spade to the queen gives a 40% chance of five tricks. In diamonds a diamond to the nine - if East plays low is only a 27% chance|pg||

nt|vugraphzgq: NS play 3way 1@C, 1@D 4+ may have longer @C 5cr M (9-16 HCP), 'destructive 2-level op.'|pg||
nt|h_karluk: When you play bridge you must be ready for conventions and their defense methods, otherwise you just let your opponents to walk like in a park|pg||

mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rnmalik: 2@S and a @D|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this is an aggressive contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: E in the tank|pg||
nt|hawe45:  He will find nothing there|pg||
nt|mdgraham: maybe I am too old, but 3@S seems pushing it a bit on that East hand - maybe 2@S would have meant something different|pg||
nt|jcwla: I agree with you, Mike.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: what, about being too old?|pg||
nt|jcwla: Yes, did you say something else?|pg||
nt|panja: 3@S is certainly a self-preempting bid, W has to P or bid game...in essence, guess|pg||
nt|hawe45:  So do I, but West could have had the right values, @d-values are not interesting.|pg||
pc|c7|nt|hawe45:  But to me, this is a contract, you might play a little faster|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: I think this NS pair is the slowest one in the event|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3@D showed lenght or value |pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: even slower then Muller|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c2|nt|panja: 5@C on @C finesse..|pg||
nt|sharkey: The speed has subseded a notch from the pace we ended previous session - so far only partials|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ah, double shows spades. So 2@s would be four-card support, 12-14-ish. 3@S looks better in that case.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Walddk4: http://www.panoramio.com/photo/5213107  for a photo of the venue, the Onstein Castle, owned by Hans Melchers, an avid bridge fan. The castle is located in the eastern part of the ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Netherlands, near Vorden|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|chessmaste: The opening bid is in a style that the Italians like to play, but it was probably invented in the 40's by Marjorie Burns as part of the Nottingham Club|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Verhees: "well played"|pg||
nt|h_karluk: long tranches without sound reason, some attention needed by TDs|pg||
pc|c3|nt|panja: perhaps, a stronger invitation than 3@C might have been more apppropriate..but what that could be is difficult to judge|pg||
pc|c9|nt|kareno: West's is not a really attractive hand.  I think 3@c was enough.|pg||
nt|sharkey: 5@C OR|pg||
nt|panja: how did the bidding go?|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|pc|d3|nt|mdgraham: one good thing about transfer responses to 1@C is that they do help to identify the nature of the fit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: which can be very useful in competitive auctions|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|h_karluk: if that was a club level game between oldies in a degree it could be acceptable. But that's an international event! Sorry, "technically" not nice.|pg||

nt|ralfwil: There is one reason for finessing - Why did E stay in 4@sX with a  (probable) 5-card @h?|pg||

pc|sA|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: he has a @D in hand now ...|pg||
pc|h3|nt|Vugraphzfb: Sorry, I was trying to get the other match fixed, hope I succeeded|pg||

nt|panja: @ST..boosts it to an easy make|pg||
pc|s6|nt|chessmaste: Now he must play a trump|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|panja: the problem for W is, he has too much strength in @H..and he now knows E is short|pg||
nt|sharkey: This is the final session of the semi finals - 14 boards to go|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|sK|nt|chessmaste: leaving declarer a trick short|pg||
nt|jcwla: One often leads a trump against preference auctions.  Here, E has preferred @D's over @S's with the pass of 2@D.  However, N's weak @S length suggested a different lead to him.|pg||

nt|hawe45:  But where is the GF-hand?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: don't think so, try to find out|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@S natural? ( I have two spades..)|pg||
nt|panja: this must be 4@H and 5 minor..|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: 4/5@H no 4@S inv.|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: is what Drijver wrote as explanation|pg||
nt|panja: y, that seems the appropriate one|pg||
nt|mdgraham: unusual to set up a game force with only 7 hcp opposite 15-17, but I guess AK109x is a good suit|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kareno: Good stop.  |pg||
nt|h_karluk: 3@s alert is a complete joke|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Jansma provides "max, good @H-suit + shortness in ?"|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: so it's not a joke ?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mdgraham: if this is invitational I must have an out-of-date CC for EW.|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: exactly same expl. now given by Brink|pg||
nt|hawe45:  In the good old days, brave men would invite (maybe) with this East-hand|pg||
pc|c2|nt|vugraphzgq: they are constantly working on their system|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, this is jolly good, thinks South|pg||
nt|panja: but after all this complicated construct, all that they have managed to achieve is to play in a 43 fit at a rather high level|pg||
nt|dutcho: polish auction for EW|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.panoramio.com/photo/5213107  for a photo of the venue, the Onstein Castle, owned by Hans Melchers, an avid bridge fan. The castle is located in the eastern part of the ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Netherlands, near Vorden|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Four pairs in each team. We have four of them at our visible tables (open and closed room) and another four at two "invisible" tables in order to give new operators some practise|pg||
pc|c9|nt|mdgraham: their 2@C is different: either 6+@C, 10-15, or 5+@S, 4+@c|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - with the suit 6-0 against them - good luck|pg||
nt|mdgraham: as a matter of doing the job, we download available CC s when we can - but as we have seen there, players do change systems and the CC's can get out-of-date.  |pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: sry I don't have an up-to-date one too|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|d4|nt|vugraphzgq: Jansma has shown any weak NT|pg||
pc|h3|nt|chessmaste: I wonder why West did not reopen with a double?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: if that's "good hand"..lol|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d9|pg||
nt|sharkey: Zimmermann originally seeded 16 (now 1); Strul originally 12 (5)|pg||
nt|sharkey: For seeding brackets http://www.acbl.org/nabc/brackets/2010/01/vanderbilt/|pg||
nt|kareno: Seems like Strul was underseeded.|pg||
nt|kareno: Zimmermann too|pg||
nt|rodal f: Non of them surpriced me. Some might remember Zimmerman in Rio.|pg||
nt|sharkey: hard to seed when you look at the start list|pg||
nt|harmon: they probably need to change the seeding with so many european players now coming to nationals|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Khven was just mucking around with 2@D - unfortunately, his opps turned nasty|pg||
pc|hA|nt|hlortz: yes the ACB|pg||
nt|hlortz: acbl seeding formula not good for foreign pairs always|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mdgraham: South possibly afraid of 3NT, and too happy with 3@H to double - still, if EW were going to bid 3NT they would have done |pg||
nt|bjacobs: Worst case - he is in -500 territory|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The defence might need to find a spade ruff - not too easy|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: that were my words not his|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Jansma announces he hopes there is a plan B|pg||
pc|sT|nt|sharkey: On the two tables in this match the US players are not present|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s7|nt|kareno: Yes, ACBL needs to account for some of the foreign teams which have had good results elsewhere.|pg||
nt|sharkey: Four world champiuons this table|pg||
nt|panja: the problem is how do you assess 'good results elsewhere'?|pg||
nt|panja: with a 5422 hand and just 7 HCP.....what is the % that 1nt is the best spot? Quite high, I would think!!|pg||
pc|s4|pg||

nt|rnmalik: I hope there is a time allotted to a board Marc, I am basically a fast player but this too slow|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: yes you'r right. open room played 4 extra boards and has catched up already|pg||
nt|yuval10: declarer try to figure out a way to make it|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hT|nt|vugraphzgq: only 100 per trick|pg||

nt|rhelle: the match is played on 4 tables, of which 2 are visible|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rhelle: and for both teams, 3 of the 4 pairs will go to the Europeans|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c4|nt|rhelle: so although this is a practice match, it's hugely important to do well|pg||
nt|rhelle: both teams made the Bermuda bowl in Brazil, and made it to the last 8|pg||
pc|c9|nt|rhelle: so we're talking world class competiton here|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c3|pc|c6|nt|ralfwil: But what had happened if E had played a @s instead of @dJ? and ruffed?|pg||
nt|april7: without @H finesse possible to make|pg||
pc|cA|pg||

pc|dJ|pc|d5|pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d8|pc|d9|pc|d7|pg||
nt|rhelle: now declarer has to guess the @hs to make it|pg||
nt|ralfwil: perhaps, but @dJ was a threat to discard the remaining @c|pg||
nt|chessmaste: They key moment was when declarer neglected to cash the @DK, pitching a club. The he plays a spade and South must ruff, but declarer discards club, wins the heart continuation and ...|pg||
nt|chessmaste: plays a club to the jack for 10 tricks |pg||
nt|april7: actually has to play @H from the top, because even if the finesse works, E can't make it|pg||
nt|rhelle: it would seem that a @s now takes away the entry for the @c|pg||
nt|april7: yes then the finesse makes it again makable|pg||
nt|rhelle: but that isn't the case - declarer can play 1 @c, and ditch his spade loser|pg||
pc|s7|nt|rhelle: would declarer missgues @s? unlikely - now North would lead a way from the K|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c2|pc|s6|pc|c7|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: I need to go deal witih the other match - I'll try to get the auction and result on this hand when I get back - very sorry|pg||
nt|sharkey: how wud you do that Prakash?|pg||
nt|sharkey: Wudnt mind being an underdog with these players on the team :)|pg||
nt|panja: you have to take a stand that it must be there...|pg||
nt|panja: there is enough data available, and mathematics is stronge enough to handle the issue if there is will|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Still he had to play low - if he led @SQ, then declarer, knowing there no problems in spades, would have just played trumps|pg||
mb|p|nt|chessmaste: This looks to have potential|pg||
nt|rnmalik: action hand|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Funny boards ...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: big double-fit here.|pg||
nt|dutcho: That is correct, I just was trying to tell it from the prospective of Jansma|pg||
mb|1H|nt|hawe45:  E/W has the best spot, non-vuln. and with majors|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Still many mis-fits|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 22/18 balanced layout|pg||
mb|p|nt|chessmaste: I prefer West's majors|pg||
nt|mdgraham: slam making both ways...|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Undo - or a tactical 2 @H!|pg||
nt|dutcho: always nice 6 card support|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So where do you go with West?  4@D?  5@D?  Or something imaginative?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|vugraphzgq: he bid 2@H|pg||
nt|rnmalik: now comes 4NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Gromov in the tank|pg||

nt|harmon: what is Chip doing to mess things up???|pg||
nt|rodal f: My son. U are forgiven:)|pg||
nt|sharkey: The other match is a battle of Swedes vs USA|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: supposedly some EW activity as 2@h last resort|pg||
nt|yuval10: W think about raising|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|panja: elsewhere, rating has been attempted..and has been somewhat of a success even in its rudimentary form...I would not like to dwell more on that here though|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: :) :) But I can't blame it on him, the operators got confused|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: That's fine, Rodal, but Jan is definitely a woman.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: If 2@H is weak, it's quite a good weak |pg||
nt|dutcho: down 2|pg||
nt|yuval10: quite naturally, 2@h can be made with some stronger-than-minimum hands with a poor suit|pg||
mb|3H|nt|chessmaste: If West bids 5@H South might go on to 6@D|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1NT=F1|pg||
nt|dutcho: NS could make 5@C|pg||
nt|rnmalik: can make 9 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: where?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Jansma bids 2@H but software restrictions do not permit me to do the same|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: South will be wondering where the spades are |pg||
nt|hawe45:  D = 0 or 2?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: dbl is interest in bidding on|pg||
nt|hawe45:  OK|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@C=long suit. Just what South wants to hear |pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: '1NT semi forcing 2@D = 4+'|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Didn't Jan leave and a new person took here place Karen?|pg||
nt|kareno: WBF ratings would work I think.|pg||
nt|kareno: Oh, I don't know that.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  So we are also|pg||
nt|yuval10: :)|pg||
pc|c7|nt|jcwla: N has a classic "death hand" - reasonably hopes for a couple of @C's but not to be - same 7-card fit but a level higher.  |pg||
pc|c4|nt|mdgraham: East might pass this, with two aces|pg||
nt|yuval10: but i agree with his bid anyway, even if non vulnerable you should seek playing games|pg||
pc|c9|nt|mdgraham: he will be disappointed|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Fast board, IÂ´m sure|pg||
nt|chessmaste: That's an overtrick|pg||

pc|cQ|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c5|pc|c6|pc|cA|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i wld swiftly pass to 2@h for those reasons : a) opener may have 11 with 6/4 junk in nonvul 2nd seat b) with 10 hcp when you see a limit rebid cannot go anywhere|pg||
pc|d9|nt|Vugraphzfb: No, this is still Jan - I left and no one took my place|pg||

nt|rhelle: yes, of course, North had already shown 10 points|pg||
nt|rhelle: so very unlikely to have the @hQ|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|d|mb|p|nt|chessmaste: Whcih 10 points?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|sJ|nt|ralfwil: Easy lead from N:)|pg||
nt|rhelle: in defence, on the previous hand, North had shown the @c Ace, @d KJ and the @sJ|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Which adds up to?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: He said sorry and left for the toiolets|pg||
nt|april7: if 2@S shows a @H preference,than S will pass |pg||
nt|rhelle: so that's 9 - with the @hQ he may well have openeed|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s4|pg||
nt|chessmaste: But even with 11 balanced the Dutch pair tend not to open|pg||

pc|c2|pc|c4|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
nt|april7: N is somehow "endplayed"!|pg||
nt|chessmaste: More exciting for North/South|pg||
nt|rhelle: yes - strangely enough, I think a @c back is best|pg||
nt|april7: but its not too bad, W loses another 2 @S and 2 @H and 1 @D|pg||
nt|rhelle: this is really difficult - very hard to see what is right when you see that dummy|pg||
nt|april7: 3 imps|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and a @d ruff|pg||
nt|april7: y|pg||

nt|panja: trump lead will work well against a @h contract..|pg||
nt|harmon: for who??|pg||
nt|sharkey: Silla is Saelensminde's nick name |pg||
mb|2C|nt|harmon: not for the defense|pg||
nt|jcwla: "3@D I do."|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not sure about 2NT with six solid diamonds|pg||
nt|hawe45:  And a singleton - no slam now, I suppose|pg||
nt|jcwla: The equivalent of the LOL bids of "4NT I do" and "4NT I don't" -- meaning I do or don't mean it as Blackwood.|pg||
nt|panja: 7@h here?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  even 8 - @H are 3-3|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: natural i.e. 21-23 bal, 3@C asks distribution|pg||
nt|yuval10: N will be able to introduce the @c now|pg||
mb|2S|nt|Vugraphzfb: Yes, when they sat down and I said that Saelinsminde wouldn't fit in the BBO name box, one of them suggested I just do Silla :)|pg||
nt|chessmaste: West might have done better to bid spades at some point - even 2@S was possible - then the double fit comes to light|pg||
nt|hawe45:  OK with that range, they bid the slam for sure|pg||
nt|panja: that is, can make 13 tricks in @H....no expectation of it being bid though|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 7@H cold on 3-3 hearts - don't think they will bid that, though :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: Well, they have steered their way into a 4-3 @H fit once this set.|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Sjoert is counting steps on his fingers|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: this 2@H bid always has a certain 'I have @S too' message, else 2@H preempt would have been on|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: N will probably compete here|pg||
mb|3C|nt|yuval10: Pass looks to me a bit weird....he knows EW has 8 cards fit in @s and he's non vulnerable|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: sry|pg||
nt|h_karluk: would you pick 3@c yuval?|pg||
nt|yuval10: ok....that's a bit better :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: and no DBL even, on @D lead it appears to be -2-vul|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i meant as S|pg||
nt|yuval10: quite tough.... if P has 2 @s's it's better to defend maybe|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Geir had a very difficult lead I think|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Boye hadn't turned the diamond ten upside down and laughingly did so, implying he had been holding Helge up, but not|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzgq: sry|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  On a @D-lead, 3 NT might make easily here|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: 2@H: usually without stopper in @D|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Perhaps Hans would care to suggest a route to 3NT?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No route - but that happens often...|pg||
pc|h5|nt|panja: when in doubt, lead a trump!|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: 3@D no 4M, 4+ @D|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: 3@H asks @D|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: 3@S = 4 (?)|pg||
nt|yuval10: even with the advertised 8 @c's support|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mdgraham: mind you, this is a bit of a perfect fit - reaching 6@D is by no means simple|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: he must have miscounted his fingers before bidding 3@S :-))|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ok ..let's study the hand. say 4/4 minors, they start with @d, so opener in 4th seat vs vul has obv 5@c/4@d - my vote is : ok to S's X, no to pass - i wld bid 3@c over 2@s in ...|pg||

nt|hawe45:  With a decent @H-suit in West, all @H-lead works|pg||
nt|dutcho: neither do I actually|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and obviousl that would be a two parter question : a) would you overcall with 2@h b) what would be your bid over NT opener's X|pg||
pc|dA|nt|Vugraphzfb: They also call the cards in Norwegian, so I have to watch the dummy|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mdgraham: South knows that North is limited by the non-strong 1@C opening  |pg||

nt|jcwla: 9 more to Russia on 4 - where EW here played 3@H-2, S in the OR played 2@H-2.|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: all pairs rotate on the different teams for the selector wants to see how the different combinations score|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: So every round 'Nederland 1' plays against 'Rusland 1' but the teams may or may not contain the same players|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: W still thinking|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This layout was not a whole lot away from a re-opening double by West, passed by East, for a large number|pg||
pc|h7|nt|sharkey: yes there is Roland - may be not in Danish|pg||
pc|h5|nt|chessmaste: It looks odd, but given that South was a pased hand should North prefer 2NT to 3@D?|pg||

nt|dutcho: both x and 3@C are possible rebids with west|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: discussion of the hand, but it's in Norwegian so I can't tell you anything, sorry|pg||

nt|dutcho: I silent 2@S for NS?|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: likely to be a good score for EW, the competitive hands are the most important in such a level!|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|chessmaste: It was awkward to be sure|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 1NT would have been interesting and EW got into makeable contract|pg||
mb|1S|nt|rodal f: Hehehe Go on Roland and we start for full speed.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This hand demonstrates just how right it is to open 1NT as North|pg||
nt|h_karluk: quite suitable shape for 2@d/2@h F****ry convention with N's collection|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: 1NT makes; 2@S doesn't|pg||
nt|dutcho: I was wrong again:)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Maybe a heart lead to 1NT would prove me wrong as well|pg||
mb|2S|nt|dutcho: well good look by Gert-Jan Paulissen|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: NS hold the balance of strength, however, since S has almost all, EW will come to more tricks than NS|pg||
mb|4S|nt|sharkey: Much of the Norwegian language originates from Danish - in addition we have dialect Norwegian, "nynorsk"|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Untraditional 12-14 NT|pg||

mb|p|nt|chessmaste: That looks to be a good lead|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Are you surprised at that lead?  |pg||

nt|mdgraham: not usually recommended, leading from jack to four |pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: 4th best, 2nd from xxxx|pg||
nt|jcwla: This looks like 5-4 inv'l and Brink passes with a prime submin.|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Sjoert confirms 15-17 with a smile|pg||
nt|hawe45:  We still think, that West has promised 15-17?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  OK - then he must refuse the invit|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: then that is some upgrade|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Bachar Abouchanab|pg||
pc|d4|nt|yuval10: S knows he has no ruffing value in @h contract but his partner has plenty in @s contract|pg||
pc|d7|nt|dutcho: well I would just lead my longest suit @D|pg||
pc|dA|nt|doctorone: Good morning all :)|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|yuval10: a nice lead by W to begin with|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sharkey: Helness opened light to get @D lead - may actually help Boye|pg||
nt|panja: S can get two possible entrie to Dummy to play @H, @SJ and @CQ..|pg||
nt|panja: W can deny him the @SJ entry by ducking @SQ..|pg||
nt|dutcho: hi Bachar|pg||
nt|yuval10: but with the favourable place of the A@c it looks likely that declarer will make|pg||
nt|h_karluk: west picked the way to ruff with his master trump|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hT|nt|chessmaste: They did not look for a major fit, so North preferred a heart to a diamond|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I would have played bak a @H in trick 2|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Seeing West unblock the @H Queen|pg||
nt|dburn:  not clear why South preferred a spade to a heart, though|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true |pg||
nt|hawe45:  Kill dummy|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Against 1NT passed out, it's quite a good idea to lead your stronger major, as a principle|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|pc|sQ|pc|s2|pg||
pc|sA|pc|d3|nt|dutcho: well usually partner has several ways to bid if he has 1 or 2 majors|pg||
nt|bjacobs: East has 11 points - it's not surprising partner has passed |pg||
nt|bjacobs: So that argument tends to come more into play when opening leader is weak|pg||
nt|dutcho: that is true so maybe that is an indication why he found this|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s7|pg||
nt|rodal f: And "nynorsk" was the norwegian language, but some danes tryed to press an other language at the norwegians. Learn to play scoccer danes:)|pg||
nt|dburn:  still, North is prepared to stick with his original idea|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Is that a new Tarantinio movie?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: sorry east|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like declarer has picked the wrong line|pg||
nt|rnmalik: and he has made it difficult for himself|pg||
nt|h_karluk: another spade to K|pg||
nt|h_karluk: than a @h to hand still not bad|pg||
nt|yuval10: @h return must be from a singelton, so E is a lot more likely to have @s length than W|pg||
pc|c5|nt|panja: did he duck @CJ?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|hawe45:  Come on declarer - your @D-trick...!|pg||
nt|dburn:  well, it is customary for declarer to wait for South|pg||
nt|mdgraham: who will probably discard a heart |pg||
nt|hawe45:  Sry - had not seen thT...|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mdgraham: hmm|pg||
nt|mdgraham: still going down though|pg||
nt|hawe45:  The 5-card @S is unknown for South|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|sharkey: So West will be endplayed|pg||
nt|yuval10: W did well not to jump, otherwise he's giving the contract away|pg||
nt|h_karluk: now @h switch a must|pg||
nt|yuval10: declarer might still hope for 3-2 @h and play K@s before @h|pg||
nt|rnmalik: he has no other option|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @s K then @h small a bonus|pg||
pc|h4|nt|rnmalik: -1|pg||
nt|yuval10: now E can choose how does he want this contract down...the stright way with 2 ruffs of @h or the longer way :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 2 ruufs better|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ruff, play a @c get 2nd @h ruff|pg||
nt|yuval10: perhaps better ruff if you're affraid of KQ@d in S|pg||
nt|yuval10: if declarer has the A@c it won't matter anyway|pg||
pc|s8|nt|dutcho: for us it is easy to see east has to play clubs|pg||
nt|doctorone: E may opt for a @d now, not willing to provide an entry for an eventula @s finesse|pg||

nt|yuval10: E didn't open his hand which is quite remarkable nowadays :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Instead of @S Ace had he played small @C he would have made it|pg||
mb|p|nt|chessmaste: 3NT making looks good - in the other room South led the king of diamonds!|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Just what East wanted, the bidding at 4@C by the time it got back to him|pg||
nt|chessmaste: At least he won't go down in 3NT|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|yuval10: 3@h - 4@h|pg||

mb|p|nt|dburn:  he wasn't all that likely to go down in 3NT, but he may well go down in this|pg||
mb|3N|nt|hawe45:  Only 3 loosers - but will that make 10 winners? I doubt it|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: 'do I need to have 10 cards in M or is 9 OK?'|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Blood round the corner|pg||
nt|panja: N has bid once too many times perhaps|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Was OK, if some of their bids had been PASS|pg||
mb|p|nt|dutcho: very nice defense by EW on board 8.|pg||
nt|dutcho: Jansma picked the wrong major to bid|pg||
nt|yuval10: E figure out that 9 tricks are easier than 10.... a bit dangerous in this hand but might succeed|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: double by North surely shows spades - reckon 3@S by South here, and then over to West|pg||
nt|yuval10: 4@h would've gone down with @c lead so this might create a swing too|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Is there any chance for @S lead|pg||
nt|yuval10: no....but red suit lead will make it interesting|pg||
nt|yuval10: @c lead will give 9th trick right away|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @S would snatch 5 right away:)|pg||
pc|d7|nt|vugraphzgq: a rather quick pass|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but West can't double with his hand, surely, even after the redouble from East |pg||
pc|d9|pc|dQ|nt|hlortz: 5@C would be in jeopardy if K@H in other hand|pg||
nt|rodal f: A new flatty by the nice @D layout? Or slamtry by 5@C as end?|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|rnmalik: good lead let the declarer work for the 9th|pg||

nt|vugraphzgq: GJP now studying opp's carding|pg||
nt|yuval10: but it's not so easy as it looks like|pg||

nt|yuval10: N should signal @s to his P in any way he can, mostly by the order of the @h's he'll play|pg||

pc|h4|nt|Vugraphzfb: Helness explaining what Helgemo has shown to Silla, but in Norwegian - I think that 3@c promised clubs and was forcing to game, but that's just from the body language|pg||
nt|sharkey: As Henry mentioned they have "rightsided" the contract so shudnt be anything to the play|pg||
nt|panja: could W have rebid 3@H on 3@D to keep alive chances of playing in 3NT? or should E have rebid 3N instead of 3@D?|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|s6|nt|dutcho: so partner could bid 1@S showing 4@H|pg||

nt|doctorone: agree, Bill. Requires work though, and these guys are certainly up to it :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: but then you're in the 5-level...might be crucial if P has waisted points in @c|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think Birman played so - long years ago in Antalya, Belladonna was also there|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|rodal f: Have never tested that out.|pg||
nt|dutcho: it has his origin from the orange club which was designed to serve the entire dutch team. Nowadays Only Jansma and Paulissen play somethigng simular|pg||
mb|2S|nt|panja: or not perhaps..11 in @S too|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Helness asking Brogeland how many somethings he had last hand - maybe spades|pg||

nt|dutcho: I like his choice of opening bid|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Yes P may not have KQJ of @S very essential for the contract|pg||
nt|yuval10: i'm quite assure Birman play 4@c here as a suit, as he was the one who teached m to play like that anyway :P|pg||

nt|bjacobs: And then he goes and bids it!|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Singleton kings are like a red rag to a bull.  You have visions of a low card being led from the ace, and you winning your king|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: N expl 1st and 2nd shows solid suit without outside stopper but 3rd is different|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: adios to 9 cards @h fit|pg||
nt|yuval10: if X wasn't for penalty, then perhaps X and 3@h over 3@d....but i suspect they might play X here as penalty|pg||
pc|sK|nt|panja: note the 1Nt rebid, 2@C will be fourth suit, not enough @H for 2@H...|pg||

nt|panja: no..4@D perhaps for me|pg||

pc|s6|pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||
