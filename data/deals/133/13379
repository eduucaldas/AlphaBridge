nt|finch: It can easily have 5 losers anyway.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Dunn will have to guess diamonds to make it|pg||
nt|royhughes: I would be tempted as declarer to run the diamond 8, rather than trying to find the entries to play South to have the ace|pg||
nt|finch: At the other table North gave West a heart guess, which she got wrong, but South ducked the queen of hearts and it made again|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I agree Roy. Winning the spade in the dummy will block the suit so you should take a first round diamond finesse|pg||
nt|warrens:  running the 8 of diamonds is the percentage play|pg||
nt|Walddk2: with only one entry left (@CA)|pg||

pc|s8|pc|s7|pg||

nt|royhughes: I think he had a better chance ducking the diamond ace, on general principles|pg||
nt|sharkey: This will make because N has @CK - SQ cud have been fatal|pg||
nt|sharkey: @SQ|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Should South not know how many diamonds declarer has? I assume North gave count when @DQ was played at trick 2|pg||

nt|finch: 4@S probably a slam try in diamonds|pg||
nt|royhughes: What is the range of 2N?  Trying for slam looks a bit aggressive|pg||
nt|finch: West is a passed hand, it can't hurt to look for a good fit|pg||
nt|royhughes: fair enough|pg||
nt|warrens:  4@S is some sort of slam invite in NT,  i presume.  Some play it weaker, some stronger than 4N directly.|pg||
nt|finch: East has no reason to accept from a 20-22 opening |pg||
mb|6D|nt|sharkey: Or showing @D suit?|pg||
mb|p|nt|royhughes: Agreed -- good controls, but minimum and sort of average fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch: Very common method here is that 4@H is a single-suited club slam try, 4@S diamond slam try|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch: (and 4@C heart slam try, 4@D spade slam try while we're at it)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|royhughes: Interesting -- haven't seen that in North America|pg||
nt|finch: All he needs to to is persuade South to play the C!Q on the first or second round and he can squeeze North(!)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|warrens:  oh, that's a nice method.  North will be under pressure early here to fine the right discards.  dummy's heart 9 is actually a threat card.|pg||

pc|h2|pg||
nt|royhughes: I think declarer can elope with the trumps now|pg||
nt|finch: (although I play 5@C as keycard in diamonds here so that may not have been available)|pg||
nt|royhughes: instead of playing for a squeeze|pg||
nt|royhughes: just ruff both clubs|pg||

nt|finch: yes South is so balanced that everything stands up|pg||
nt|warrens:  yes, can make it now no matter what the defense does.  |pg||

nt|royhughes: Well, the long club can be set up now|pg||

nt|royhughes: Declarer needs everything he can get!|pg||
nt|finch: Our team is playing tonight, but we try and let everyone play about the same number of matches overall so I'm having the evening off|pg||

nt|finch: This hand demonstrates an advantage of not playing strong 10s|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s8|pc|s9|nt|finch: If the jack denies a higher honour, declarer could duck out the ace offside|pg||

pc|s7|pc|sT|pc|s2|nt|royhughes: I'm a little surprised at the diamond finesse, instead of playing clubs|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|sharkey: perhaps W shud have ducked the @S/...?|pg||
nt|royhughes: It's tricky -- maybe trying to get the defence to play clubs|pg||
nt|finch: Strong 10s are a leading convention where the 10 shows at least one non-touching higher honour (AJ10/KJ10/A109 etc)|pg||
nt|finch: They tell partner a lot about the hand when you do/don't lead the 10 (against NT), but also give declarer a lot of information|pg||
nt|sharkey: *@S7|pg||
nt|finch: Some people hate them, others like them|pg||
nt|royhughes: Maybe West should just exit with the low spade|pg||
nt|sharkey: also called Journalist leads?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think those people lead the 9 from A109 so that the 10/9 shows none or two higher|pg||
nt|finch: There are quite a few variants on the principle|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's consistent with 3rd leads|pg||
nt|royhughes: West has quite a problem -- nothing looks safe except a spade, I think|pg||
nt|finch: The early diamond finesse has also confused West as it's not obvious to her that a diamond back is the simplest way to best the contract|pg||

mb|1C!|mb|p|nt|sharkey: Slamming..|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2D|nt|royhughes: There is a chance for a slam here -- it's borderline that this club suit would play for 4 tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: @C10 makes the slam acceptable|pg||
nt|sharkey: Can they b id it?|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|royhughes: It would be very well done to bid it -- the values appear marginal tome|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Double showing three-card spade support is my guess|pg||
nt|royhughes: Yes, I think so, which is helpful here|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|finch: Slam is fractionally better than just the clubs coming in - on a diamond lead there's the tiny extra chance that South is squeezed in the minors|pg||
nt|sharkey: 1@C shows?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2+ cards, hence the alert|pg||
nt|finch: 1@C in the context of a 5-card major / short club system.  Not strong.|pg||
mb|4S|nt|sharkey: ty|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|royhughes: Yes, there is chance of a squeeze, or a club lead from a doubleton, for example|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In most countries 1@C is alertable if it can be fewer than three cards|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|finch: The lead will speed the play up at any rate|pg||
nt|royhughes: On the downside for a slam, a 4-0 trump break might create a bit of trouble, especially on a heart lead|pg||

mb|5S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mr murray: 4n/t must be the 19 count|pg||
nt|jallerton: she would pass with 15 (or perhapd double if they have agreed that to show a strong NT hand)|pg||
pc|dK|nt|daman: and     would it be apropos for East to bid 4@D on the way to 4@S?   or would that be a bit much? |pg||

nt|jallerton: she'd double with 15/17, Guy confirms|pg||
nt|roswolf: bd6 was flat identical auction and lead|pg||
