nt|vugrapha2: director has left the table to consider his ruling|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1D|nt|vugrapha2: related to the 2NT call by Lusk|pg||
mb|1S|nt|caitlin: whether it promised 4?|pg||

mb|p|mb|2S|mb|d|nt|caitlin: over X 2NT is typically Jordan/Truscott 2NT ......same thing|pg||
nt|patricck: I think I might have found a bid on the East hand there|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|caitlin: like 1NT|pg||

pc|sJ|nt|patricck: Yes, either that or 2@C depending on style|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|patricck: Perhaps it is a little lucky that 3NT makes with the @D finesse, but I am sure some tables will find it|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: sorry    BBO froze up for a few minutes and missed the start of play|pg||
nt|patricck: Every other table probably|pg||

nt|loganrun: Hi again - if East bids 1NT - West will raise to 3|pg||
nt|patricck: As a non-passed hand I would always bid 1NT, the passed hand status allows a little more latitude|pg||

nt|patricck: and since it looked like east had only 2 diamonds that encouraged declarer to get the @H right as well|pg||
