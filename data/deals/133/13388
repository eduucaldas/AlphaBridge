mb|1H|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: However, the players are not that lucky. They don't know the layout|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|athene: small spade lead from east is impossible to find, but a club lead isn't|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: then west might realise there's no hope unless his partner holds the @SA|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Easy to be a movie star if West is on lead|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Bid up the line when you are strong enough|pg||
nt|athene: well, whilst declarer draws trumps and claims, we can discuss whether south should respond 1@D|pg||
nt|ritong: because @ds are a suit too  bidding 1@h almost buries them, when 1@d leaves both options alive|pg||

nt|chick: Hi Jeroen :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzeg: wb Jeroen|pg||
nt|benjent: 4@h looks kind of ok single dummy, but the evil @s & @d breaks are going to create some problems|pg||
nt|jpmbs:  nice contract to start with|pg||
nt|chessmaste: has North shown his passport - he must be far too old:) |pg||
nt|rich89: hi everybody|pg||
mb|3S|an|.|nt|benjent: The defence have to be careful. For example, if North tries a low @s at trick 2, declarer is in good shape|pg||
nt|benjent: The cleanest defence is to play trumps. North would like to do that, but he'll be thinking about whether he can afford to overtake the @s9 with his weak @s pips|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a trumph switch will break|pg||
nt|haans: puppet?|pg||
mb|p|nt|rich89: weak nt|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ralfwil: a @h switch is not so difficult from S either|pg||
nt|benjent: And now it's a very hard task for South to find the @h switch|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|benjent: from his point of view, it's not clear that @d ruffs is a major threat|pg||
mb|p|nt|rich89: mom i read the sistem:)|pg||
nt|haans: Bergen told us that|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ralfwil: But with only @hQ8, only an enpassant is a trick|pg||
nt|haans: Hi Riccardo|pg||
pc|d5|nt|benjent: For all he new, with his poorly placed @cK, the defence needed to cash 2 @d tricks ... and partner's @s5 at tricks one might have suggested a @d switch|pg||

nt|athene: i suppose if you respond 1@D you might make it a bit easier to find 6@D on a 4-4 fit, but if you want to be in slam in diamonds after a 1@C opener, usually partner is going to be ...|pg||
nt|athene: reversing into them anyway after 1@C - 1@H|pg||
nt|ritong: matter of style, i guess:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why is that, Bill? Some open 1@C with 4-4 in the minors|pg||
nt|athene: so south just decided it was better to conceal information from the defence|pg||
mb|1N|mb|d!|an|5 m and 4 M|mb|p|nt|athene: well, yes, if you open 1@C with 44 minors that increases the number of hands where you have a diamond fit there|pg||

nt|xenya: nice|pg||
pc|cK|nt|chick: 21 HCP game, but it will work|pg||
nt|benjent: Meanwhile, back at the ranch, 4@s is a pretty good contract but beatable on a @c ruff|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c6|nt|ralfwil: will go down if EW take their @c ruff|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|othered1: East can overtake to force it, but would west read it as doubleton?|pg||
nt|benjent: West might find the low @c switch now, just as an ordinary kind of defence|pg||
nt|ritong: east should have took this to revert to @cs|pg||
nt|benjent: I think it's better for East to duck as he did - the @c is kind of an obvious switch|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I think E should have taken over and returned a @c|pg||
nt|chick: a low club at this point might not look very attractive, given no info about partner's club shortness|pg||
nt|ritong: taken*|pg||
nt|othered1: @H looks more obvious to me|pg||
nt|chick: Ralf has it right, E must show the club ruff possibility|pg||
nt|chick: (and Henri) :)|pg||
nt|Walddk3: You cheering for France, Henri? :)|pg||
nt|ritong: np|pg||
nt|benjent: If East overtakes the @d and shifts to a @c, it will look very much like a singleton|pg||
nt|ritong: naaaah:)|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Must be a nice situation for you|pg||
nt|Vugraphzeg: As a kib points out, the @D7 is often played as s/p here, and W has all the low cards but the 4, he might get it right|pg||
nt|othered1: naaaah:)|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|xenya: very well done by Italy|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hello Vladimir!|pg||

nt|ritong: 12 boards is a very fast run, though|pg||

nt|benjent: 2@s was probably going to be a perfectly acceptable contract in the 4-3. 3@h could be a 5-0 for all he knows|pg||
nt|ritong: by the way, i think NS have a strong advantage in this situation playing the last boards of a relatively important tourney with 600+ kibs  as we can see, east tends to  play ...|pg||
nt|ritong: quickly and instinctively|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and 3@h must be forcing - or?|pg||
nt|othered1: could 2@s be forcing, assuming dbl showed only @H?|pg||
nt|benjent: There's a very wide range of ranges for jump raises in these situations - and a vast menagerie of methods to go with it|pg||
nt|chick: as some kibs are pointing out, slam is possible on bd 23, so perhaps not as clear who that will be good for :)|pg||
nt|haans: with that lead close to making 3|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|nt|rich89: 2@s:5@c and 4@s|pg||
nt|chick: I prefer 6N looking at all hands, but only because the @CQ falls|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s9|nt|benjent: 4@h is not ridiculous, but it will be unsuccessful|pg||
pc|sT|nt|rich89: 2nt relay     3@h :4@h|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ralfwil: perhaps I´m a little bit conservative, but I bid 1H over 1@d and D with a more balanced hand|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dQ|nt|rich89: 3nt stronger then 4@s|pg||
nt|xenya: i think 6@S is quite good here |pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|s7|nt|benjent: I wonder if NS had a disconnect over the meaning of X|pg||
nt|othered1: but do they play 1@H shows @S?|pg||
nt|rich89: 1@c-1@h=4+@s|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sA|nt|ralfwil: no problems to make 6@s but a careful play is needed.  (Safety play in @s)|pg||
nt|rich89: y|pg||
nt|ralfwil: asking for @sQ in my system|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|xenya: natural but unlucky lead here|pg||
pc|s8|pc|cT|pc|c5|nt|ralfwil: maybe, but now they landed in a forcing situation|pg||
nt|ralfwil: any other idea about 6@h?|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|xenya: that helps|pg||
nt|chick: so much for worrying about the @CQ :)|pg||
pc|d6|nt|benjent: Some of the Australian juniors at this tournament do. They would also play various transfers in West position over the X as well|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d3|nt|ralfwil: I don´t agree with that lead|pg||
nt|xenya: now the safety play in trumps is possible|pg||
nt|chick: now the safety play in @Ss makes it easily|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|xenya: still it looks as if 1N should always make|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ralfwil: A @d now for -2?|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hJ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|chick: ouch|pg||
nt|haans: no @D entry|pg||

nt|benjent: Extra points for style, sir|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|xenya: but as a few shrewd kibitzers point out, the safety play looked dangerous because of a possible club ruff -- i agree |pg||
mb|2H|nt|benjent: Last board at this table I believe - although not the last comparison to come in|pg||
nt|ritong: dangerous hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: contestable:)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: ????|pg||
nt|chick: once the clubs were safe, he could afford to lose a trump, but not a trump and a club ruff|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|chick: both of the unscored hands look likely to be flat, so this will be France2's last chance to even it up |pg||
nt|Vugraphzeg: Sorry, I hope everyone's heart's still beatingg :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|cJ|nt|Vugraphzeg: Beating even|pg||
nt|xenya: on 4 (7@S -1 here), the OR got to 7@C -- no chance of course and a push|pg||
nt|xenya: same contract in OR i'm told -- hardly surprising|pg||
nt|othered1: That looks too high as cards lie.  22 hcp games often need help and they're not getting  it here.|pg||
nt|haans: hard to see 10-12 imps here|pg||
nt|haans: mb in play|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|nt|benjent: I have a hard time believing 2@s was the right bid by North|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ritong: a simple cue|pg||
nt|benjent: To my eyes, Volcker said "I'd really like to defend some vulnerable doubled contract"|pg||
pc|d5|nt|benjent: And how could Bessis know that that was not their best plan?|pg||
nt|ritong: west bid 2@h freely|pg||
nt|othered1: As long as south absolutely guarantees a rebid over 2@H.  does he?|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d6|pg||
pc|c9|nt|benjent: But 2@h could be made with zero spades and one heart. So long as you are confident that pass is forcing, then North has an easy forcing pass|pg||
nt|Vugraphzeg: Lots of chit chat going on at the table continuously, including people poking their heads under the screen|pg||
nt|ritong: setting up the glue for the rest of the auction|pg||
nt|Vugraphzeg: I wish my French was as fluent as theirs :)|pg||
nt|benjent: My rule in these attempted penalty auctions is that we are in a forcing auction unless the opponents jump (which is when they really demonstrate a fit)|pg||
nt|chick: Bd 23 was flat, as predicted, and this one is likely to be also|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Last board in this set, so Thanks all and see you at 15.00|pg||
nt|othered1: that style in penalty auctions looks reasonable.  Are the opponents entitled to know about it and how would they get this arcane bit of information?|pg||
nt|ritong: current score is fr243 fr1 49 i guess|pg||
nt|benjent: Interesting question. I think you have to be wise to the idea that auctions such as this may be forcing and ask|pg||
nt|benjent: Down at the local club against the weaker players, we take the trouble to over-alert and explain as much as we can, but I think experienced players should be expected to have a ...|pg||
nt|benjent: certain level of bridge knowledge and expectation|pg||
pc|c3|nt|chick: 4-1 spades 28%, so if he felt the @C ruff was a real danger, he played it right.|pg||

pc|h4|pc|s4|nt|benjent: Bessis was protecting against J10xx(x) club in the pocket|pg||

mb|2H!|mb|2S|nt|othered1: small slam or 1400 penalty in 7@H ties the match.  |pg||

nt|yuval10: if they bid 6@s we're tied|pg||
nt|chick: do we know what happens in a tie?|pg||
nt|yuval10: 3 more boards i believe? like 2 years ago?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Extra boards I assume, and the French don't have time for that!|pg||
nt|ritong: bessis:"whoa"|pg||
nt|haans: odds for 5@H |pg||
nt|Vugraphzeg: 2 more boards, i know how it works :)|pg||

mb|4H|mb|5H!|mb|p|mb|5S|nt|haans: 4@H is that winning bridge?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: So either they bid the grand slam or no slam at all. France can't afford a tie :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: heh|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: imps for France on the previous hand no doubt|pg||
