mb|d|mb|2N!|nt|panja: 4@h will make because @C K is in..not easy to bid though|pg||

mb|p|nt|panja: @DKQ seem like wasted values..|pg||
mb|3S|nt|Walddk4: Good morning everyone and welcome back to the Netherlands for a practise match between the host team and Russia. Three segments of 20 boards today|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Four pairs in each team. We have four of them at our visible tables (open and closed room) and another four at two "invisible" tables in order to give new operators some practise|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello Shirley, Mike and Marc|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: first set 37-4 Russia. Score not carried forward? |pg||

mb|p|nt|kareno: Fixed!!|pg||
nt|sharkey: Well done!|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello all and welcome|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Good judgement, @D better than @H|pg||
nt|roswolf: tasty hand to start|pg||
nt|sharkey: E need to switch to @H when in on @C first time to set this|pg||
nt|sharkey: assumed @D lead....|pg||
nt|sharkey: makes now|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm not the best lead but it is the first board of the day and a Sunday as well:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: I checked once more as he has @D8 too and the light is bad but it is really @H8|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Brink Drijver (a strong pair) use 5 Maj 5@D (except 4441), 2@C - Game Forcing is 2@C, 2@D@H@S weak with interesting auction after 2Maj open|pg||
nt|roswolf: ty giorio|pg||
nt|roswolf: giorgio- sorry|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: I am sitting close to Bas Drijver who is usually very helpfull in giving explanations to the audience|pg||
nt|roswolf: declarer in deep thought!?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: yes, still thinking|pg||
nt|sharkey: @C9 a key card too|pg||
nt|bridge_one: they use also 1NT open in first not vuln 9/12 (else 15/17) - multilandy vs NT but with 2@H/@S interesting hand also witouth minor out|pg||
pc|hK|nt|Walddk4: Our operator is Marc van Beijsterveldt|pg||

nt|bjacobs: Hello|pg||
nt|dutcho: Morning all|pg||
nt|rnmalik: welcome back|pg||
nt|h_karluk: if original multi i play = a) weak 2 majors b) 2NT (19-21 balanced with 4/5 cards) c) any 4441 then I cannot pass as North. On the other hand with 4 cards at the other major that's ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: an irregular opening bid. Pass fine with me.|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: sorry missed the play ...|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Was it alerted, I think alertable call that I have @D|pg||
nt|stewball: 2@d likely = @h|pg||

nt|lestergold: Ive seen a lot of this young Dutch pair but I am unfamiliar with the Russians |pg||

pc|hT|nt|harmon: ty Jan|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@D transfer, 2@s=break (good heart fit) |pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: explanation was asked and given but could not understand|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|nt|jcwla: Not sure what the double of 4@D is -- some pairs play "double up" or "double down" of splinters asking for leads of low/high side suits.  Maybe not on same wavelength here.|pg||
pc|sK|nt|hawe45:  No - the russians are very fair|pg||
nt|mdgraham: followed by 4@D either splinter or (more likely) transfer at the four-level|pg||
nt|Walddk4: There is another match taking place simultaneously, so they are going to calculate an aggregate score by the end of the day I suppose|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Four pairs in each team. We have four of them at our visible tables (open and closed room) and another four at two "invisible" tables in order to give new operators some practise|pg||

pc|s6|nt|vugraphzgq: Welcome from the 'bridge farm' 't Onstein in Vorden|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Good afternoon|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: slight delay in start because 4 Dutch players arrived a little late :-(|pg||
nt|panja: 4@D was a shot in the dark, it seems like....but N has three useful honours, @HAK and @CQ...|pg||

mb|d|mb|p|nt|benjent: Matushko just calculating how much he thinks he can beat 3@c....|pg||
nt|benjent: And deciding "plenty" is the answer|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|d2|nt|benjent: It's a reasonably straight forward 2 off ... and Verhees should be able to play @c's twice towards the board to hold it to that|pg||

nt|benjent: I like his @s continuation .... force declarer to make his own running in the @c suit|pg||

nt|vugraphzgq: NS play 3way 1@C, 1@D 4+ may have longer @C 5cr M (9-16 HCP), 'destructive 2-level op.'|pg||

nt|roswolf: looks that way marc|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzgq: E asks and N says 'short'|pg||
nt|roswolf: curiouser and curiouser|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: the axe should fall|pg||
nt|bridge_one: kholomeev-khyuppenen use a classic 2/1 approach with any difference: 2@C also weak with @d, 2@D open = bal 18/19 (italian style) to have 1minor => 2Nt natural long suit strong ...|pg||
nt|bridge_one: hand, xefrt walsh after 1@C open, 1Nt response semiforcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: apparently the 2@C bid was not availbable here -- for some reason  |pg||
nt|h_karluk: mini roman also suitable for east's collection|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|rnmalik: 2@S and a @D|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this is an aggressive contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: E in the tank|pg||
nt|hawe45:  He will find nothing there|pg||
nt|mdgraham: maybe I am too old, but 3@S seems pushing it a bit on that East hand - maybe 2@S would have meant something different|pg||
nt|jcwla: I agree with you, Mike.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: what, about being too old?|pg||
nt|jcwla: Yes, did you say something else?|pg||
nt|panja: 3@S is certainly a self-preempting bid, W has to P or bid game...in essence, guess|pg||
nt|hawe45:  So do I, but West could have had the right values, @d-values are not interesting.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://nbbuitslagen.transfer-solutions.com/uss/goPage14.do?rndid=76228&verid=778&catid=  for results|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Four pairs in each team. We have four of them at our visible tables (open and closed room) and another four at two "invisible" tables in order to give new operators some practise|pg||
nt|rnmalik: yes and it makes key cards are very nicely placed.|pg||
nt|sybarra: the spade bid should give a hint as to placement |pg||
nt|lestergold: very lucky to have @dK with North the hearts playing for no loser|pg||
pc|s6|nt|hawe45:  But to me, this is a contract, you might play a little faster|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: I think this NS pair is the slowest one in the event|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3@D showed lenght or value |pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: even slower then Muller|pg||

nt|bridge_one: seam signal og Brink/Drijver - small ancourage, reverse count|pg||

nt|h_karluk: maybe one day in your local club worths to use : http://www.worldwidefolks.com/Competitive%20Bridge/conventions/Conventions%20Contents/Cnv_mini_roman.htm|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mdgraham: ah, double shows spades. So 2@s would be four-card support, 12-14-ish. 3@S looks better in that case.|pg||
nt|sharkey: sounds to me like EW have beein misinformed?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: also russiam pair is expert - so we will see a very good match here|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Netherlands, near Vorden|pg||
nt|stewball: if the def stays passive,this looks to drift 1 off|pg||
nt|xenya: yes|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|roswolf: quite possible - although east made an anti% bid imo|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|lestergold: but its not qa bad game if you expect to lose a heart a spade and a club it would be basically on the dim finesse|pg||
nt|lestergold: the heart position the only one to mean no loser is of course very fortuitous|pg||
pc|h3|nt|chessmaste: The opening bid is in a style that the Italians like to play, but it was probably invented in the 40's by Marjorie Burns as part of the Nottingham Club|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Verhees: "well played"|pg||
nt|h_karluk: long tranches without sound reason, some attention needed by TDs|pg||
pc|h7|nt|panja: perhaps, a stronger invitation than 3@C might have been more apppropriate..but what that could be is difficult to judge|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|kareno: West's is not a really attractive hand.  I think 3@c was enough.|pg||
nt|sharkey: 5@C OR|pg||
nt|panja: how did the bidding go?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1Nt for other minor ( or other major ) and 4cards maj is a gadget loved by netherland pair|pg||
nt|roswolf: cashing out in defence is one of the under practised arts of the game|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Instead Russian pair use 1NT overcall natural|pg||
nt|sharkey: cant see any tricks vanish here Geoff|pg||
nt|bridge_one: so possible to see the swings for this reason|pg||
nt|roswolf: true but it saves thinking time|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h9|pc|h4|nt|sybarra: on the right track |pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|mdgraham: one good thing about transfer responses to 1@C is that they do help to identify the nature of the fit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: which can be very useful in competitive auctions|pg||
nt|h_karluk: yes but very slow tempo|pg||
pc|h2|nt|h_karluk: if that was a club level game between oldies in a degree it could be acceptable. But that's an international event! Sorry, "technically" not nice.|pg||
pc|hT|nt|h_karluk: The right thing to do for NS is to call TD, point out what's going on at the table to preserve their rights in case alloted time exceeded|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|lestergold: we can see what he feared|pg||
nt|sybarra: but not an easy hand |pg||

mb|p|nt|hawe45:  red|pg||
nt|bridge_one: pass in east bec vuln|pg||
mb|p|nt|harmon: they bid a game on finesse not worth discussing|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no double from East, not expecting West to contribute much to the defence|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Right solution|pg||
nt|hawe45:  A trump-lead would - as almost always is the case - kill the contract, IÂ´m sure|pg||
nt|dutcho: Might be poor choice of words Bill|pg||
mb|p|nt|stewball: i expect E will get his @s in|pg||
nt|sharkey: can they get to slam here?|pg||
nt|roswolf: the 4-0 trump break may be troublesome|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: this is a very profitable save :-)|pg||
nt|lestergold: well driver does not have much defence so this could be a very good board for the Rissians|pg||
nt|sybarra: in category of "render unto caesar" ...more profitable now without X |pg||
pc|hA|nt|panja: something wrong here..|pg||
nt|harmon: uhhm quit the bidding for NS|pg||
nt|panja: a P by brogeland to begin perhaps|pg||
nt|sharkey: 2@d-2@s-2 nt-3@c-5@c|pg||
nt|mdgraham: quiet contract |pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: little confusion as the 2@D card was missing|pg||
nt|bjacobs: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: break in tempo was with North|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 5@S will be interesting ... it might just make|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Although probably not|pg||
nt|xenya: and he did|pg||
nt|dutcho: like he did|pg||
nt|stewball: 4@s surely|pg||
nt|xenya: um -- KJ of hearts don't look too nice...|pg||
pc|h8|nt|chessmaste: Declarer will win this and probably play a diamond|pg||
nt|panja: regulation lead|pg||
nt|jcwla: :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @D 7 is better|pg||
nt|panja: oh, I thought @D7 was led....|pg||
nt|panja: wasn't that the card that was showing earlier?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: it was a combination of bad light and misclick :-)|pg||
nt|roswolf: see no reason why not|pg||
pc|h5|nt|bjacobs: North might have to neutralize dummy's diamonds by playing 3 rounds of the suit|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: he has a @D in hand now ...|pg||
nt|xenya: so a cautious 3|pg||
nt|stewball: the rest makes up for it|pg||
nt|bridge_one: East use a prudent approach, because know they are a terrible distribution, so don't give informations at opps|pg||
pc|h7|nt|Vugraphzfb: Sorry, I was trying to get the other match fixed, hope I succeeded|pg||
nt|sharkey: So Zimmermann will regain the lead|pg||
nt|panja: 6@D here..touch and go|pg||
nt|harmon: yes he claims on any lead|pg||
nt|panja: @ST..boosts it to an easy make|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup silence is golden on this hand|pg||
nt|sharkey: South's cue shud be all N need here - may get too high?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: But seven @h are ON bec West have all small @H ... a J10xx was sufficient to beat the grand slam|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|chessmaste: Now he must play a trump|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|panja: the problem for W is, he has too much strength in @H..and he now knows E is short|pg||
nt|sharkey: This is the final session of the semi finals - 14 boards to go|pg||
nt|xenya: well done|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|s8|nt|chessmaste: leaving declarer a trick short|pg||
nt|jcwla: One often leads a trump against preference auctions.  Here, E has preferred @D's over @S's with the pass of 2@D.  However, N's weak @S length suggested a different lead to him.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|hawe45:  The finesse here has no sense|pg||
pc|s7|nt|dutcho: 3@S looks right with the west cards|pg||
nt|xenya: 5@D NS is not such a bad save but they got nowhere near it|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - shud make|pg||
nt|roswolf: well north knows things fit well and has all the controls - might gamble on the doubleton spade in south's hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: the final bid was a bit agricultural|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|lestergold: Driver does not expect 2 hearts to be stabding up on this auction|pg||
pc|d2|nt|bridge_one: North closure at 6 may be too much fast - the space to take other informations there are (any minor K was excellet for North)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|kareno: Why touch and go?|pg||
nt|harmon: hell cash Q of d 1st in case d's 4-0|pg||
nt|panja: good or lucky? a very think line between the two.....@SJ and @ST are not what bidding unearths, yet, without them, there would be no slam|pg||
nt|harmon: not touch and go thats just blather|pg||
nt|panja: thin line...even|pg||
nt|hlortz: the challenge here was bidding not the play...|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|pg||
nt|stewball: suit pref @h 7|pg||
nt|dutcho: well east had 0 or 1 @D 4@S 3@H 5+@C|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dQ|pc|dA|nt|sharkey: "agricultural?" - not a term I usually assoiciate with slam bidding Geoff....|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|rnmalik: taken us about 30 minutes for 3 boards:)|pg||
pc|s6|nt|dutcho: as expected north found the defense|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mdgraham: getting shortened|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s9|pg||
nt|rnmalik: now 2 @D and @S exit and W is end played for -1|pg||

mb|p|nt|bridge_one: i dont agree - a slow approach give the informations at South to estabilish the importance of 4 cards raise|pg||
nt|sharkey: Kib points out 2 NT denied 3 x @S so may be shud be able to bid grand|pg||
mb|1D|nt|mdgraham: EW 1NT 15-17, 9-12 at favourable vulnerability|pg||

nt|rodal f: History by how the different teams came to there round: http://www.acbl.org/nabc/brackets/2010/01/vanderbilt/|pg||
nt|h_karluk: GS ok|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6@h an enormous slam|pg||
mb|1H|nt|roswolf: yup it is good in that case -good inference spotted by the kibber|pg||
nt|sybarra: S already think slam when pard opens |pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: 2@h shows spades, I suppose.|pg||
nt|panja: 3@S is the limit..|pg||
nt|mdgraham: EW play 2@s as 5-10, 6+@S, not as a two-suiter  |pg||
mb|1N|nt|rodal f: Force bid only I belive Karen.|pg||
nt|hlortz: wonder who had the seed this quarter cant imagine bessis fancied playing fantunes again|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 2@D GF Stayman|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But where is the GF-hand?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: don't think so, try to find out|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@S natural? ( I have two spades..)|pg||
nt|panja: this must be 4@H and 5 minor..|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: 4/5@H no 4@S inv.|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: is what Drijver wrote as explanation|pg||
nt|panja: y, that seems the appropriate one|pg||
nt|mdgraham: unusual to set up a game force with only 7 hcp opposite 15-17, but I guess AK109x is a good suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: likely to be bid and made in both rooms 7 as cards lie|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @hQ falls, @dK hook works, in fact might not need|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|sybarra: not sure one should be in 7 even though it makes|pg||
nt|lestergold: of course not a good seven unless you are trailing towards end of match|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 clubs check back|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: pitch @d to @s master, ruff sluff, draw trumps =13 trix|pg||
nt|lestergold: or ur name ism roland|pg||
mb|2H|nt|kareno: Good stop.  |pg||
nt|h_karluk: 3@s alert is a complete joke|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Jansma provides "max, good @H-suit + shortness in ?"|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: so it's not a joke ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: if this is invitational I must have an out-of-date CC for EW.|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: exactly same expl. now given by Brink|pg||
nt|hawe45:  In the good old days, brave men would invite (maybe) with this East-hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: right,  Roland in it everyday |pg||
nt|lestergold: anyone hear of roland the gungho slam biddwer?|pg||
nt|sybarra: think this is now blackwood and bid 6 |pg||
nt|h_karluk: if anyone adopted 'Give no quarter' principle then reasonable GS there|pg||
mb|4N|nt|vugraphzgq: they are constantly working on their system|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, this is jolly good, thinks South|pg||
nt|panja: but after all this complicated construct, all that they have managed to achieve is to play in a 43 fit at a rather high level|pg||
nt|dutcho: polish auction for EW|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.panoramio.com/photo/5213107  for a photo of the venue, the Onstein Castle, owned by Hans Melchers, an avid bridge fan. The castle is located in the eastern part of the ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Netherlands, near Vorden|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Four pairs in each team. We have four of them at our visible tables (open and closed room) and another four at two "invisible" tables in order to give new operators some practise|pg||
nt|bridge_one: another way would be to use by South a different responce at 3@h - bidding directly over level of 4@H to give 4 cards raise and a control (sample 4NT = 4cards raise (Hxxx), no ace ...|pg||
nt|bridge_one: out (otherwise 5 in the Ace ) a 1+K out|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: their 2@C is different: either 6+@C, 10-15, or 5+@S, 4+@c|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - with the suit 6-0 against them - good luck|pg||
nt|mdgraham: as a matter of doing the job, we download available CC s when we can - but as we have seen there, players do change systems and the CC's can get out-of-date.  |pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: sry I don't have an up-to-date one too|pg||
nt|stewball: a breather here...|pg||
nt|sybarra: we will 2 w/o the q |pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|vugraphzgq: Jansma has shown any weak NT|pg||
nt|stewball: anyone know why we are not getting any comparables?|pg||

nt|h_karluk: if that's "good hand"..lol|pg||
nt|xenya: other room started with 19 and 20|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sharkey: Zimmermann originally seeded 16 (now 1); Strul originally 12 (5)|pg||
nt|sharkey: For seeding brackets http://www.acbl.org/nabc/brackets/2010/01/vanderbilt/|pg||
nt|kareno: Seems like Strul was underseeded.|pg||
nt|kareno: Zimmermann too|pg||
nt|rodal f: Non of them surpriced me. Some might remember Zimmerman in Rio.|pg||
nt|sharkey: hard to seed when you look at the start list|pg||
nt|harmon: they probably need to change the seeding with so many european players now coming to nationals|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Khven was just mucking around with 2@D - unfortunately, his opps turned nasty|pg||
mb|p|nt|hlortz: yes the ACB|pg||
nt|hlortz: acbl seeding formula not good for foreign pairs always|pg||
nt|h_karluk: S has a big after p's opening|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes (see above)  was just a matter of which slam |pg||
nt|lestergold: has 13 tricks hearts breaking without dim finesse|pg||
pc|sT|nt|mdgraham: South possibly afraid of 3NT, and too happy with 3@H to double - still, if EW were going to bid 3NT they would have done |pg||
nt|bjacobs: Worst case - he is in -500 territory|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|nt|bjacobs: The defence might need to find a spade ruff - not too easy|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: that were my words not his|pg||

pc|sK|pg||
nt|sharkey: On the two tables in this match the US players are not present|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|nt|kareno: Yes, ACBL needs to account for some of the foreign teams which have had good results elsewhere.|pg||
nt|sharkey: Four world champiuons this table|pg||
nt|panja: the problem is how do you assess 'good results elsewhere'?|pg||
nt|panja: with a 5422 hand and just 7 HCP.....what is the % that 1nt is the best spot? Quite high, I would think!!|pg||
pc|h2|nt|hlortz: perhaps give weight to wbf rankings|pg||

nt|roswolf: west will no doubt run for the hills|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: there is no alert, Brink shows his muscles when asked about the meaning|pg||

nt|dutcho: indeed |pg||

nt|lestergold: 6@h not bad could be in trouble on a trump lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: wonder if this is "junk stayman" |pg||
mb|3S!|nt|panja: elsewhere, rating has been attempted..and has been somewhat of a success even in its rudimentary form...I would not like to dwell more on that here though|pg||

nt|sybarra: and if so now what?|pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: That's fine, Rodal, but Jan is definitely a woman.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: If 2@H is weak, it's quite a good weak |pg||
nt|dutcho: down 2|pg||
nt|yuval10: quite naturally, 2@h can be made with some stronger-than-minimum hands with a poor suit|pg||
nt|bridge_one: conservative 2@S by South - finding a good raise probably he know north don't pass|pg||
mb|3N|nt|chessmaste: If West bids 5@H South might go on to 6@D|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1NT=F1|pg||
nt|dutcho: NS could make 5@C|pg||
nt|rnmalik: can make 9 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: where?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Jansma bids 2@H but software restrictions do not permit me to do the same|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @H|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that's smolen there|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 @S=more hts than spades (I think like puppet) |pg||
nt|sybarra: it is smolen|pg||
nt|h_karluk: http://www.bridgeguys.com/Conventions/Smolen.html|pg||
nt|lestergold: note that 6n is a great slam---- when the diamonds break 3/3 that is....|pg||
nt|lestergold: Roland would dfeinitely be in a slam here|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think Brink has a tough bid now |pg||
nt|lestergold: Hard decision for Brink here|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 4@h auto|pg||
mb|4N|nt|mdgraham: South will be wondering where the spades are |pg||
nt|hawe45:  D = 0 or 2?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: dbl is interest in bidding on|pg||
nt|hawe45:  OK|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@C=long suit. Just what South wants to hear |pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: '1NT semi forcing 2@D = 4+'|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6H even on a trump lead i think a long club can be set up form a 12th trick because hearts break 3/3|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 @H one option,  4 nt quanti is another |pg||
nt|lestergold: but if they decide toplay 6n they are in serious trouble|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 4@h bcos, yr p might have @sKJx @hxx @dAJxx @cKQJx|pg||
nt|lestergold: with only 30 combined points and no suit fit greater than combined 7 cards, slam is intrinsincally an unsound proposition|pg||
nt|sybarra: so does drijver pass?|pg||
nt|lestergold: howeverc many matches even at top level are deided on lucky unsound decisions|pg||

mb|5N|nt|jcwla: N has a classic "death hand" - reasonably hopes for a couple of @C's but not to be - same 7-card fit but a level higher.  |pg||
nt|roswolf: a natural redouble would have produced an e/w heart contract so i suppose nothing really lost|pg||
nt|lestergold: these are youngish players not shy of strtetching their values|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: East might pass this, with two aces|pg||
nt|yuval10: but i agree with his bid anyway, even if non vulnerable you should seek playing games|pg||

mb|6H|nt|sharkey: S will top out @CK I think|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 5/2 better than 4/3 with a little visualization of E looking into his hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: i wld swiftly pass to 2@h for those reasons : a) opener may have 11 with 6/4 junk in nonvul 2nd seat b) with 10 hcp when you see a limit rebid cannot go anywhere|pg||
nt|lestergold: well thyeve bid the pips off|pg||

nt|vugraphzgq: sry no clue for explanations don't want to disturb the players|pg||
nt|h_karluk: with 3-3 trumps break for any world master really easy|pg||
nt|lestergold: as we can see no trump lead and its easy to engineer the spade ruff for a twelth trick|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: according to coach Anton Maas 5NT means pick a slam|pg||
nt|lestergold: trump is not the noprmal textbook lead against a small slam|pg||
nt|sybarra: they landed right on the "picking" |pg||

nt|h_karluk: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Sanremo/graphics/DSC_5905-Senior-Gold.jpg|pg||
nt|lestergold: because having removed the easy play option Drijvwer has to either rely on 3/3 dims or establish a club|pg||
nt|h_karluk: with regards to Mr Anton Maas|pg||
nt|sybarra: he might be able to negotiated the clubs |pg||
nt|lestergold: but going for club establishment relies on 3/3 heart break or hand would fall apart so what will he do?|pg||
nt|sybarra: no actually not |pg||
nt|lestergold: he has chopices he has options what should he do foloks?|pg||

nt|yuval10: with AT9XXX ? not in my book :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: he went for dim break in effect|pg||
mb|2H|nt|h_karluk: matter of styles |pg||
mb|d|nt|mdgraham: I remember the late Joe Amsbury saying in one of his books that on hands like that you should aim to play the hand, come what may|pg||
nt|lestergold: as Isaid at the beginning that was an option but i cant see why he didnt ruff a club before testing the trumps than he would have hadt he mntries  to establish the club|pg||

nt|roswolf: can north show his hand adequately|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: 3@H michaels like may have worked better|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i have not much sympathy to that 1st seat in vul vs nonvul 2@h|pg||

mb|p|nt|sharkey: yes - 5@C good sac|pg||
nt|sybarra: gets the hand off your chest,  just a wk 2 |pg||
pc|dK|nt|sharkey: What's Silla to do?|pg||
nt|panja: trump lead will work well against a @h contract..|pg||
nt|harmon: for who??|pg||
nt|sharkey: Silla is Saelensminde's nick name |pg||
nt|xenya: yes, but somehow i doubt they'll get there|pg||
nt|stewball: dbl here might get them there|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2Nt 3 cards fit (but in balanced hand, so no sgl)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|harmon: not for the defense|pg||
nt|jcwla: "3@D I do."|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not sure about 2NT with six solid diamonds|pg||
nt|hawe45:  And a singleton - no slam now, I suppose|pg||
nt|jcwla: The equivalent of the LOL bids of "4NT I do" and "4NT I don't" -- meaning I do or don't mean it as Blackwood.|pg||
nt|panja: 7@h here?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  even 8 - @H are 3-3|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: natural i.e. 21-23 bal, 3@C asks distribution|pg||
nt|yuval10: N will be able to introduce the @c now|pg||
pc|d2|nt|Vugraphzfb: Yes, when they sat down and I said that Saelinsminde wouldn't fit in the BBO name box, one of them suggested I just do Silla :)|pg||
nt|chessmaste: West might have done better to bid spades at some point - even 2@S was possible - then the double fit comes to light|pg||
nt|hawe45:  OK with that range, they bid the slam for sure|pg||
nt|panja: that is, can make 13 tricks in @H....no expectation of it being bid though|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 7@H cold on 3-3 hearts - don't think they will bid that, though :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: Well, they have steered their way into a 4-3 @H fit once this set.|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Sjoert is counting steps on his fingers|pg||
nt|stewball: S hand will improve considerably|pg||
nt|dinos1: 4@c now?|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|panja: this 2@H bid always has a certain 'I have @S too' message, else 2@H preempt would have been on|pg||
nt|stewball: every thing he has is working hard|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|yuval10: N will probably compete here|pg||

nt|bridge_one: 4@D instead 4@h is correct, bec give at the partner the elements to know what make after a 4@S by S|pg||
pc|h2|nt|yuval10: Pass looks to me a bit weird....he knows EW has 8 cards fit in @s and he's non vulnerable|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: sry|pg||
nt|h_karluk: would you pick 3@c yuval?|pg||
nt|yuval10: ok....that's a bit better :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: and no DBL even, on @D lead it appears to be -2-vul|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i meant as S|pg||
nt|yuval10: quite tough.... if P has 2 @s's it's better to defend maybe|pg||
nt|stewball: ugh|pg||
nt|xenya: 4@C on Qxxxx ?|pg||
nt|stewball: now S has easy 5@c imo|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sharkey: Geir had a very difficult lead I think|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Boye hadn't turned the diamond ten upside down and laughingly did so, implying he had been holding Helge up, but not|pg||
nt|dinos1: X was t/o - short @h|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: sry|pg||
nt|bridge_one: stand leads (any use small from XX)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|hawe45:  On a @D-lead, 3 NT might make easily here|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: 2@H: usually without stopper in @D|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Perhaps Hans would care to suggest a route to 3NT?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No route - but that happens often...|pg||
nt|xenya: i'm about to change my verdict -- seems they are on their way to 5@C (at least?)|pg||
pc|d7|nt|panja: when in doubt, lead a trump!|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: 3@D no 4M, 4+ @D|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: 3@H asks @D|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: 3@S = 4 (?)|pg||
nt|yuval10: even with the advertised 8 @c's support|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mdgraham: mind you, this is a bit of a perfect fit - reaching 6@D is by no means simple|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: he must have miscounted his fingers before bidding 3@S :-))|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ok ..let's study the hand. say 4/4 minors, they start with @d, so opener in 4th seat vs vul has obv 5@c/4@d - my vote is : ok to S's X, no to pass - i wld bid 3@c over 2@s in ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: competition|pg||

nt|yuval10: *fit|pg||
pc|h4|pg||

pc|d5|nt|mdgraham: although on a low diamond to the ten and jack, North plays clubs...West gets in and plays @D8 through.....East can switch to a heart for another diamond|pg||
nt|chessmaste: in 3@C declarer has no problems|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: he thinks he has ...|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|d8|pc|s3|nt|bridge_one: @D 3/2 and K@H in finesse - so np for East|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|sybarra: I would probably bid 3....  but would definitely bid with W hand |pg||

nt|vugraphzgq: all results on http://www.nbbportal.nl/7024/clubcompetitie_2.html|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzgq: sry I was disturbed|pg||
nt|xenya: np Marc|pg||
pc|cK|nt|yuval10: if it's 4+ m then perhaps he'll avoid it..but it's very likely for P to have 5-5 when he's red|pg||
nt|rnmalik: that is true|pg||
nt|lestergold: this is not a cake walk|pg||
pc|c7|nt|sharkey: Are they convering in English at the table Jan?|pg||
nt|sharkey: conversing*|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Mostly in Norwegian, but that was English - don't know if it's the same word|pg||
nt|hawe45:  With a decent @H-suit in West, all @H-lead works|pg||
nt|dutcho: neither do I actually|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and obviousl that would be a two parter question : a) would you overcall with 2@h b) what would be your bid over NT opener's X|pg||
nt|dinos1: 5@h wd be exclusion blkw?|pg||
nt|xenya: they won't reach a @S contract if they don't agree the suit|pg||
nt|stewball: not sure how redbl helps pard here|pg||
pc|c6|nt|Vugraphzfb: They also call the cards in Norwegian, so I have to watch the dummy|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South knows that North is limited by the non-strong 1@C opening  |pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: short break as the late lunch arrived and players make their choice from the rolls|pg||
nt|mdgraham: a bit unlucky, really. @HAKQ wasted|pg||
nt|h_karluk: just make a good guess in @s|pg||
nt|lestergold: declarer can  easily lose 2 dim tricks here as the odds are a first round finesse of the 9|pg||
nt|lestergold: meanwhile brink has to find a switch|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|dutcho: this will be interesting|pg||
nt|bjacobs: In a way, the lower 2@H bid is more dangerous than the higher 2@S bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: not the best as it happens|pg||
nt|h_karluk: I bet Vadim smiles right now|pg||
nt|lestergold: j@h was the only 'safe' card to play |pg||
pc|dA|nt|sharkey: Dont have "nice" in Norwegian - or anything close...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: There is no word for nice in Norwegian|pg||
nt|Walddk4: :)|pg||
nt|hlortz: the truth comes out!|pg||
nt|panja: N playing for doubleton @CH with E|pg||
nt|jcwla: 9 more to Russia on 4 - where EW here played 3@H-2, S in the OR played 2@H-2.|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: all pairs rotate on the different teams for the selector wants to see how the different combinations score|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: So every round 'Nederland 1' plays against 'Rusland 1' but the teams may or may not contain the same players|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: W still thinking|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This layout was not a whole lot away from a re-opening double by West, passed by East, for a large number|pg||
nt|bridge_one: any pair use 2@S immediatly with North cards (limit 6 good cards) to take the advantage to know fast the strong of the hands in the line and leave space at opps to bid|pg||
nt|sharkey: thus 2@S slow way probably more constructive|pg||
nt|roswolf: well i do but then i am strange!:)|pg||
pc|d5|nt|sharkey: yes there is Roland - may be not in Danish|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|chessmaste: It looks odd, but given that South was a pased hand should North prefer 2NT to 3@D?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: egg and bacon for me please |pg||
nt|xenya: perhaps N is going to take command?|pg||
nt|dinos1: hard to get much from S who bid spades w/o AK|pg||
pc|h4|nt|dutcho: both x and 3@C are possible rebids with west|pg||
pc|h2|nt|stewball: hm|pg||
nt|xenya: sounds mysterious  |pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|pg||
nt|dburn:  well, North didnt have to bid on - he might conclude that South would not have @cA or @cK since he could have bid 3NT if so|pg||
pc|hK|nt|rodal f: Those Danich:)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: on @H void is it not difficult|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: 'spade finesse, 1 or 2 down'|pg||
nt|dinos1: 5N - ask @cA or "choose slam"?|pg||
nt|xenya: not to S though|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|hlortz: tho trusting a Dane's comment about Norwegians.. doubtful|pg||
nt|panja: the @D duck encouraged a losing @C finesse, it seems..|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: and similar Nederland 2 vs Rusland 2|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Now an endplay against West in the red suits|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - but for 1 down|pg||
nt|xenya: well done |pg||
nt|stewball: invitation to disaster unless its clear|pg||
nt|stewball: and perhaps it was to S|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: 5NT: "bid 7 with good club"|pg||
nt|dinos1: thk 5N was grand slam force|pg||
nt|dutcho: well they got to the top spot|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: N has shown strong with @C, 1st rnd ctrl @H, S showed @D ctrl and 5@D with 4@S|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hT|pg||
pc|h3|nt|yuval10: N would've done better to unblock the @d's|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sharkey: Danes & Norwegian usually get along - we both have problems with the Swedes sometimes :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: what is te rush  here to ruff the heart?|pg||
pc|d4|pc|h9|pg||
nt|lestergold: left himself badly placed|pg||
nt|lestergold: what now?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @sA93 and Q1062 good enough, probably would play for @c A and @c exit|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Q@D has made him think to find KT@D with E|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|nt|roswolf: south caught napping there|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|yuval10: so his P can play @s|pg||
nt|h_karluk: then it all depends your @s guess as i said b4|pg||
pc|dK|nt|bjacobs: Declarer will need to fall back on the club finesse|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Although I suppose he could also play for a club ruff, so cancel the above comment|pg||
nt|dutcho: he could just give a club right bill?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Oh, give up a club?  ... So declarer can do practically anything he likes, and make it?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: still overruff ad 3 rounds clubs good defense|pg||
nt|sharkey: @H now|pg||
nt|sharkey: guess doesnt matter|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Q@D seam better|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dT|nt|panja: would have made with @D 33|pg||

pc|s6|nt|dutcho: true:)|pg||

pc|s4|pc|sA|pc|s7|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lestergold: ??|pg||
pc|s8|nt|hawe45:  Would have made, I think, by taking the @H 9 from dummy in first trick - ending like this|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well played, even so|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|lestergold: i suppose that does jusr as well|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|s8|pc|sJ|pc|s7|pg||
nt|benjent: He's going down, and losing some imps, but he's certainly had worse penalties playing mini|pg||

nt|benjent: I expect Verhees pitched the @h2 encouraging, and then the @d2 ... confusing|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h8|pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: discussion of the hand, but it's in Norwegian so I can't tell you anything, sorry|pg||
nt|dburn:  still, I suppose South might have had @dA, in which case 5@d might not be a lot worse than the spade finesse|pg||
nt|dutcho: I silent 2@S for NS?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: pretty end game |pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: likely to be a good score for EW, the competitive hands are the most important in such a level!|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
mb|p|nt|chessmaste: It was awkward to be sure|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 1NT would have been interesting and EW got into makeable contract|pg||
nt|dutcho: the 2@c makes life hard for NS|pg||
nt|dinos1: as 4@c|pg||
nt|bridge_one: East can bid 1Nt (bec used for 4M5m)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: can't (sry)|pg||
nt|sharkey: The Dutch didnt get to slam on Bd 3 so Russia have opened a 19-0 lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: would it have made without defence solving the dim layout problem|pg||
mb|1D|nt|rodal f: Hehehe Go on Roland and we start for full speed.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This hand demonstrates just how right it is to open 1NT as North|pg||
nt|h_karluk: quite suitable shape for 2@d/2@h F****ry convention with N's collection|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: 1NT makes; 2@S doesn't|pg||
nt|dutcho: I was wrong again:)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Maybe a heart lead to 1NT would prove me wrong as well|pg||
nt|dinos1: pushed them to overbid|pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 5 other table in 3 nt making +2|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 25/15 4@h worths to try|pg||
mb|1H|nt|dutcho: well good look by Gert-Jan Paulissen|pg||
nt|dutcho: yes and both north and south have their bid|pg||
nt|bridge_one: so 1Maj can be 4 cards if the hand is good (14+)|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would have doubled with the east hand in the circumstances|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: NS hold the balance of strength, however, since S has almost all, EW will come to more tricks than NS|pg||
nt|sharkey: agree |pg||
mb|4H|nt|sharkey: Much of the Norwegian language originates from Danish - in addition we have dialect Norwegian, "nynorsk"|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Untraditional 12-14 NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: sry no alert on 1NT, just 15-17 :-)|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: that's what their cc says|pg||
nt|yuval10: 4@s now|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with passed hand in my partner the bid of 1@h (giveng the lead) isn't bad|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Bas got the answer he wanted 2nd from 4 small|pg||
nt|h_karluk: slow approach good here|pg||
mb|p|nt|chessmaste: That looks to be a good lead|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Are you surprised at that lead?  |pg||
nt|dutcho: this lead also attacks the only direct entry to dummy|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Long day here - for East|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not usually recommended, leading from jack to four |pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: 4th best, 2nd from xxxx|pg||
nt|jcwla: This looks like 5-4 inv'l and Brink passes with a prime submin.|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Sjoert confirms 15-17 with a smile|pg||
nt|hawe45:  We still think, that West has promised 15-17?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  OK - then he must refuse the invit|pg||
nt|dinos1: 5@d now?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: then that is some upgrade|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Bachar Abouchanab|pg||
nt|dinos1: yes|pg||
pc|sT|nt|yuval10: S knows he has no ruffing value in @h contract but his partner has plenty in @s contract|pg||
nt|sybarra: this should be -1 |pg||
nt|h_karluk: depends West's defense|pg||
nt|lestergold: well ths is an example mof why i personally do not tend to respond with han ds like North's|pg||
nt|lestergold: a k an two Js is not in my view an upgradeable 5 count|pg||
nt|rnmalik: now a chance , play AK@H and @S and pitch one @D, would that work|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @sA and @c Q would be a nice move to test West's nerves|pg||
nt|lestergold: probably|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: bathroom|pg||
nt|lestergold: can draw twoo rounds of trumps lay spades get rid of dim loser but then west is in draws third trumps and declare is short of trick|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i guess declarer has no luxury to test trumps right now|pg||
pc|sA|nt|dutcho: well I would just lead my longest suit @D|pg||
pc|s6|nt|doctorone: Good morning all :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: well that is true|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|yuval10: a nice lead by W to begin with|pg||
pc|d3|nt|sharkey: Helness opened light to get @D lead - may actually help Boye|pg||
nt|panja: S can get two possible entrie to Dummy to play @H, @SJ and @CQ..|pg||
nt|panja: W can deny him the @SJ entry by ducking @SQ..|pg||
nt|dutcho: hi Bachar|pg||
nt|yuval10: but with the favourable place of the A@c it looks likely that declarer will make|pg||
nt|h_karluk: west picked the way to ruff with his master trump|pg||
nt|xenya: just 1 down?|pg||
nt|dinos1: yeah|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dT|nt|chessmaste: They did not look for a major fit, so North preferred a heart to a diamond|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I would have played bak a @H in trick 2|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Seeing West unblock the @H Queen|pg||
nt|dburn:  not clear why South preferred a spade to a heart, though|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true |pg||
nt|hawe45:  Kill dummy|pg||
nt|sharkey: i see only 6 tricks here...|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Against 1NT passed out, it's quite a good idea to lead your stronger major, as a principle|pg||
nt|lestergold: hoping that Drijver doesnt cash the second diamond|pg||
nt|lestergold: declarfer is hoping for some kind of misdefence|pg||
nt|h_karluk: East read what declarer tries to do, so @s 9 or @hx still good - even @cJ reasonable|pg||
nt|lestergold: the old play of playing the suit you dont want the opps to play|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|bridge_one: K @d was played hoping to find A in @d in North|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hT|nt|dutcho: well usually partner has several ways to bid if he has 1 or 2 majors|pg||
nt|bjacobs: East has 11 points - it's not surprising partner has passed |pg||
nt|bjacobs: So that argument tends to come more into play when opening leader is weak|pg||
nt|dutcho: that is true so maybe that is an indication why he found this|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h9|pg||
nt|rodal f: And "nynorsk" was the norwegian language, but some danes tryed to press an other language at the norwegians. Learn to play scoccer danes:)|pg||
nt|dburn:  still, North is prepared to stick with his original idea|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Is that a new Tarantinio movie?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: sorry east|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like declarer has picked the wrong line|pg||
nt|rnmalik: and he has made it difficult for himself|pg||
nt|h_karluk: another spade to K|pg||
nt|h_karluk: than a @h to hand still not bad|pg||
nt|yuval10: @h return must be from a singelton, so E is a lot more likely to have @s length than W|pg||
pc|s3|nt|panja: did he duck @CJ?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|hawe45:  Come on declarer - your @D-trick...!|pg||
nt|dburn:  well, it is customary for declarer to wait for South|pg||
nt|mdgraham: who will probably discard a heart |pg||
nt|hawe45:  Sry - had not seen thT...|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mdgraham: hmm|pg||
nt|mdgraham: still going down though|pg||
nt|hawe45:  The 5-card @S is unknown for South|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1@H made now|pg||
nt|bridge_one: @s blocked|pg||
nt|bridge_one: East know (after the auction) all hight cards location|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|sharkey: So West will be endplayed|pg||
nt|yuval10: W did well not to jump, otherwise he's giving the contract away|pg||
nt|h_karluk: now @h switch a must|pg||
nt|yuval10: declarer might still hope for 3-2 @h and play K@s before @h|pg||
nt|rnmalik: he has no other option|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @s K then @h small a bonus|pg||
pc|s4|nt|rnmalik: -1|pg||
nt|yuval10: now E can choose how does he want this contract down...the stright way with 2 ruffs of @h or the longer way :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 2 ruufs better|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ruff, play a @c get 2nd @h ruff|pg||
nt|yuval10: perhaps better ruff if you're affraid of KQ@d in S|pg||
nt|yuval10: if declarer has the A@c it won't matter anyway|pg||
pc|s9|nt|dutcho: for us it is easy to see east has to play clubs|pg||
nt|doctorone: E may opt for a @d now, not willing to provide an entry for an eventula @s finesse|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: it was not in the played position and he took it back|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s8|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Yes, he ducked the club J and then won the next one|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sharkey: Nice|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes as i expected he cleared one dim sneakily form this purpose|pg||
pc|c2|nt|hawe45:  I agree with Brink - is 1 NT then the hand is too good for 12-14|pg||
pc|d7|nt|sybarra: good bye @D|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|pc|c3|nt|hawe45:  if 1 NT|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|h6|pc|d8|nt|vugraphzgq: actually Jan played @C10 before @C9, now discussing if this was the right card |pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Two down whatever happens|pg||
nt|lestergold: but as i said earlier he is trick short in any cawse|pg||
pc|c8|nt|jcwla: 8 to Netherlands on 5 - where Gromov went down 2 in 3@C Verhess brought home 3@S/S in the OR.|pg||

nt|daman: and this is a pianola hand    4@H in both rooms would be my guess      time for more coffee|pg||
nt|benjent: May need to guess the @d's in 4@h. Looks like West will play it, and North will lead @cQ. West should duck to break communication, and that will solve all his problems|pg||

nt|h_karluk: did i miscount?|pg||
mb|2C!|an|!H|nt|jcwla: Kaplan/Rubens evaluated it to 13.5: http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=J75+AK+98+AT7653|pg||
nt|h_karluk: east doesn't have 12?|pg||
nt|yuval10: E didn't open his hand which is quite remarkable nowadays :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Instead of @S Ace had he played small @C he would have made it|pg||
nt|roswolf: dont like 3@D|pg||
nt|h_karluk: do you agree with 1@s  overcall?|pg||
mb|p|nt|chessmaste: 3NT making looks good - in the other room South led the king of diamonds!|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Just what East wanted, the bidding at 4@C by the time it got back to him|pg||
nt|chessmaste: At least he won't go down in 3NT|pg||
mb|2H|nt|yuval10: 3@h - 4@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|doctorone: yes... I think for NT to be playable, you hope for some @s support anyhow|pg||
nt|dutcho: ReHi all, I lost connection|pg||
nt|h_karluk: true Rasid|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|doctorone: welc back :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This hand is going to play like a foot|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn:  he wasn't all that likely to go down in 3NT, but he may well go down in this|pg||
nt|bridge_one: me too don't like because leave too space and 5 cards arn't sufficient|pg||
nt|roswolf: north was pragmatic|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: I think S thought because of dbl pd could be weak with @D|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes providing that is partnership style which i am sure it is|pg||
mb|4H|nt|hawe45:  Only 3 loosers - but will that make 10 winners? I doubt it|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: 'do I need to have 10 cards in M or is 9 OK?'|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Blood round the corner|pg||
nt|panja: N has bid once too many times perhaps|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Was OK, if some of their bids had been PASS|pg||
nt|xenya: time for coffee|pg||
nt|dinos1: only  @d lead cd beat|pg||
nt|dinos1: rather impossible|pg||
mb|p|nt|dutcho: very nice defense by EW on board 8.|pg||
nt|dutcho: Jansma picked the wrong major to bid|pg||
nt|yuval10: E figure out that 9 tricks are easier than 10.... a bit dangerous in this hand but might succeed|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: i don't understand why not 2@d (after the dbl) - may be they use a convention about 2@D in this sequence|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: double by North surely shows spades - reckon 3@S by South here, and then over to West|pg||
nt|yuval10: 4@h would've gone down with @c lead so this might create a swing too|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Is there any chance for @S lead|pg||
nt|yuval10: no....but red suit lead will make it interesting|pg||
nt|yuval10: @c lead will give 9th trick right away|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @S would snatch 5 right away:)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i would pass at 2nd seat vul vs nonvul|pg||
pc|c3|nt|vugraphzgq: a rather quick pass|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but West can't double with his hand, surely, even after the redouble from East |pg||
nt|lestergold: always easier to vome in at 1 level with a poor hand than 2 level with quite a good hand|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cT|nt|hlortz: 5@C would be in jeopardy if K@H in other hand|pg||
nt|rodal f: A new flatty by the nice @D layout? Or slamtry by 5@C as end?|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|rnmalik: good lead let the declarer work for the 9th|pg||
nt|yuval10: of course S can discard over 6@h's 4@c's and one @d and still beat the contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: GJP now studying opp's carding|pg||
nt|yuval10: but it's not so easy as it looks like|pg||
nt|rnmalik: at times it becomes hard for the defender to analyise that a contract has been bid without @S stopper|pg||
nt|yuval10: N should signal @s to his P in any way he can, mostly by the order of the @h's he'll play|pg||
nt|h_karluk: courageous lead|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|jcwla: Russia did bid and make 6@D on 6 so 12 more, up 31-9.|pg||
nt|panja: I have to logoff now, thx all, bye|pg||
nt|jcwla: Thx Panja|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: bye|pg||
pc|c5|nt|Vugraphzfb: Helness explaining what Helgemo has shown to Silla, but in Norwegian - I think that 3@c promised clubs and was forcing to game, but that's just from the body language|pg||
nt|sharkey: As Henry mentioned they have "rightsided" the contract so shudnt be anything to the play|pg||
nt|panja: could W have rebid 3@H on 3@D to keep alive chances of playing in 3NT? or should E have rebid 3N instead of 3@D?|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cA|pg||
nt|hawe45:  22 IMPÂ´s board 5 - when did we see that score...?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 6@Dx+1 at one table, 6@Sx+1 at the other|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Russia made a doubled slam +1 in both rooms|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Both doubling pairs lost an overtrick also|pg||
nt|mdgraham: cost an imp, that|pg||
nt|rnmalik: That was some hand to think of it|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Nice score in a 10-board-match|pg||
nt|rnmalik: This hand would further add some imps to NS |pg||
nt|dinos1: will shift to @s playing S for @sQ10x?|pg||

nt|h_karluk: a real gem|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, nice defence resulting in an overtrick or 2|pg||

nt|bridge_one: 1@H xfert (of course)|pg||
mb|2C|nt|Vugraphzfb: Comment by Silla and laughter - I was thinking I wouldn't want to be playing rubber bridge against Helness this set, so maybae that's what he said|pg||
nt|bridge_one: to give @h would bid Dbl|pg||
mb|p|nt|harmon: can he find sp lead??|pg||
nt|panja: B58, N finessed out of bidding|pg||
nt|yuval10: if they will it will surely be interesting|pg||
nt|h_karluk: cash @h A then play towards @d K and claim 12 tricks - we see, how about declarer :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: with 11 cards chances are for play of @HAce and @D are friendly and a 6|pg||
nt|xenya: what's 1@D? -- weak hand or hearts? |pg||
nt|xenya: hearts|pg||
nt|dinos1: @h|pg||
mb|3D!|an|5/5 GF|nt|rnmalik: 4@C|pg||

mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Do they response 1@S with hearts?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@c like a drury|pg||
mb|3N|nt|panja: N could as well have 5 @H...as the present hand..|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Helness asking Silla something, I think about spot card leads|pg||
nt|mdgraham: suspect 1@S=transfer to 1NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: ...or not....|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: it looks it is but Sjoert choose to pass (Bas saying 1@S could be 2@S)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: oh thanks for double|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: according to dummy GJP 1@D is lots of hands, mostly no other bid available (so certainly no @H)|pg||
mb|p|nt|dutcho: yes but 1@H with 4-4 major|pg||
nt|yuval10: the X by W "convince" N not to think about slam|pg||
nt|xenya: N must have thought that a double at any point would be too dangerous -- i tend to agree |pg||
mb|p|pc|h6|nt|dutcho: so partner could bid 1@S showing 4@H|pg||
nt|doctorone: Then, S may well have found the @h lead|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that gives a chance to get 12 tricks|pg||
nt|roswolf: well a high risk contract|pg||
pc|h2|nt|bridge_one: interesting 3Nt finding the stop with Qx Jxx in @c - but K@D out is a bad notice (:|pg||
pc|hK|nt|bridge_one: perfect lead - keeping the communication with partner|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|xenya: any bid i mean|pg||
nt|h_karluk: buckle up, let's keep body and soul together :) transportation problems for declarer|pg||

pc|dJ|pg||
nt|sharkey: Compared to the fireworks we had at the end of 3rd quarter this match definitely has quieted down|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|panja: but...if one consider the chance..for N to have 5 @H...EW each would have to have 22..whereas for 5@S..it could be 3-2..just A to five would do...I guess @S has a little better % ...|pg||
nt|panja: chance of success in IMPs|pg||
nt|harmon: oyyyyyyyy|pg||
nt|bridge_one: need play the finesse|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c3|nt|yuval10: is everybody play here 4@c as shortness? for me 2@s ( beginning of short trail bid ) following by 4@c over P's relay bid of 2NT will show void|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|dutcho: North found the switch so I guess 7 tricks if my count is correct|pg||
nt|h_karluk: now home sweet home, i bet West would question himself for not playing @d Q|pg||
pc|s5|nt|h_karluk: @d A marked|pg||
pc|s4|nt|dinos1: 8 top tricks for def|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the only reason to don't play the finesse is to have see the opps cards :)|pg||

nt|benjent: I expect North was angling for 3NT with a @h card|pg||
nt|daman: I don't know about canape    I think 1@C was strong and artificial|pg||

mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rhelle: now North's hand looks quite good|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzgp: For those who watched the lastsegment with Muller-de Wijs on the board where they bid 6@D I checked and 4NT was optional blackwood denying a spade control|pg||
nt|daman: if he raised to 4@D instead of bidding 3@H   I suspect they could have reached slam|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||

nt|doctorone: agree, Bill. Requires work though, and these guys are certainly up to it :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: but then you're in the 5-level...might be crucial if P has waisted points in @c|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think Birman played so - long years ago in Antalya, Belladonna was also there|pg||
mb|1N|nt|xenya: anyway looks like a good score for Russia -- 3N can't be made on careful defence|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Have never tested that out.|pg||

mb|p|nt|bjacobs: My answer was: "he should be thinking of 3NT"|pg||

nt|doctorone: I was thinking about N's choice here, and I like it :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And then he goes and bids it!|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Singleton kings are like a red rag to a bull.  You have visions of a low card being led from the ace, and you winning your king|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: N expl 1st and 2nd shows solid suit without outside stopper but 3rd is different|pg||
nt|xenya: not that any given defence is careful enough|pg||
nt|h_karluk: this is a "high" reverse example|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|roswolf: a void splinter is likely|pg||

nt|vugraphzgq: now Sjoert wants explanation (before he decides to double or not?)|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: with the trump suit being diamonds less room to investigate|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the reason bec i think 4@s splinter is that South can't use exclusion blkw with minimum open|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Your chance to play at 't Onstein yourself:|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Patton tournament on Whitsun. More info on www.onstein.info|pg||

nt|hlortz: he's more concerned with making sure of 10 :(|pg||
pc|s3|nt|bridge_one: but it is also true that 3@S was splinter the same (i use 3@s also with sgl and a strong open, instead 4@S weak points but void)|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|bridge_one: well, ty Marc|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|harmon: thats wrong anyway|pg||
nt|xenya: not yet|pg||
nt|dinos1: if return @sJ - duck|pg||
nt|dinos1: then only @d shift beats|pg||
nt|bridge_one: March told 4@S splinter with void in not strong hand|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Marc is the operator, so know the explain at the table|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d6|pc|dK|nt|hlortz: but everything breaks so all will be well|pg||
nt|dinos1: duck|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|panja: he is...so he will likely ruff second @D|pg||
nt|rnmalik: It was tough for E to DBL 1@S without @C and there he is playing a @C contract|pg||
pc|d5|nt|dinos1: uc? hard to sfift to @d's w/o @d signal|pg||
nt|xenya: W needs to duck this too|pg||
nt|dinos1: no matter|pg||
pc|d7|pc|s2|pg||
pc|d4|nt|dutcho: well against gambling people sometimes just lead an ace|pg||
pc|d9|nt|bridge_one: the exclusion blw is usefull, but can't be used jumping 3 level of bid ....|pg||
pc|dA|nt|dinos1: @hK - @s - @h fin|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|panja: and a @D ruff will not hold decl to 11|pg||
nt|panja: now..|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Helness had the @d Q out but put it back and put hands behind head and thinking|pg||
nt|panja: he has @D count..and knows N should be 65 or 75 in @D@S...|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|h_karluk: this carefully landed slam @d is <my review> kind of creme a la creme, deserved an applause and a corner in daily bulletin|pg||
pc|h3|nt|doctorone: They say one should lead an A in these auctions... Would someone consider leading the @s A? (not that it matters here)|pg||
pc|c2|pc|dT|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h7|nt|h_karluk: ok, i think <my analyse> x 4th seat could serve well to find 9 cards @h fit for EW; I admit 1NT also not bad with 15 balanced, but a problem arose after 2@s rebid of opener|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h6|pg||
pc|h4|nt|bjacobs: I would consider it, but the explanation is key.  North could have an off-centre hand|pg||
nt|dutcho: well vs 3th seat it is very different|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hT|nt|xenya: yes true|pg||
nt|rnmalik: The moment of truth approaching for the declarer|pg||
nt|helene_t:  Kholomeev needs to guess @cQ. Since Brink is short in diamonds he is more likely to have club length. So declarer will probably guess right|pg||

nt|benjent: Van Prooijen probably figured West for @sQJ for the @sK play off the board ... and he's already seen @dA, so that means West can't have both @cA and @cQ|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: I'd have thought this team was the top team in Norway for many years - I'm sure all 4 of them were on the Norwegian team that Meltzer beat in Paris in the Bermuda Bowl|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I could ask the same question here?  What bid should South be thinking of?  I bet he's thinking of some number of notrumps!|pg||

nt|dutcho: very thing game for ew here|pg||

mb|p|nt|doctorone: EW will do well to take the save in @s if NS find their minor game (@d likely)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: okay, last board, thanks to operator, my fellow commentators and kibbers|pg||
pc|h2|nt|dutcho: at the colours I think 2NT is enough|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And now anything less than 5@D is not enough (from North) IMHO|pg||
nt|h_karluk: with rebid problems |pg||
pc|hJ|nt|sharkey: On bd 57 OR in 5@C - got a @H lead and shud be set|pg||
pc|hA|nt|Vugraphzfb: Silla held the tray a moment on the 4@h bid and Helness laughed|pg||
nt|dutcho: he has a great hand indeed|pg||

pc|h9|nt|panja: good lead..|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: We're making up for last night's boring matches tonigh :)|pg||
nt|dutcho: KT98 and KJ in partners suits is great and singleton spade is also very nice|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I thought North might try 6@D, half expecting to get a 6@S bid which he could more confidently double|pg||
nt|rnmalik: :) that is life|pg||
nt|h_karluk: yes sir :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx Marc our operator,   terrific job! |pg||

nt|yuval10: normal bidding so far|pg||
nt|dutcho: good lead|pg||
nt|xenya: on 8, the Netherlands managed to stop in 4@D making (5@DX -1 here) -- 6 imps to the Dutch|pg||
pc|d9|nt|Vugraphzfb: Helness "Ah Ha"|pg||
nt|bridge_one: a competitive bid (easy for E/W being not vuln)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|sharkey: I believe most of us wud lead @SQ....|pg||
nt|panja: from the bidding S knows that W is close to 15-17 Nt range...|pg||
nt|panja: and hasn't opened 1Nt....|pg||
nt|sharkey: N may try low @S for 2. @C ruff - S does not have stiff @S view opening lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Helness said something and I sort of leaned forward questioningly and he says "it ain't easy I tell them" :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: After the last chat in Norwegian I told them I couldn't do my job properly if they spoke in Norwegian, that you all expected me to tell you what was going on|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But in fact, they were in "bid accurately" mode|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 4@S a better contract|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Thanks all and C....................U shortly to some entertaining bridge.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|doctorone: an option, surely, Bill|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think 3@d out of issue - i liked 3@h |pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|yuval10: W know he can face void @s with P so he passed...unlucky, was hoping for a better @d holding from P|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|nt|sharkey: meaning "I have @SK..."|pg||
nt|h_karluk: would i be thinking same in case !q108x - surely not|pg||
nt|yuval10: J?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i meant @d Q108x|pg||
nt|h_karluk: sorry for typo|pg||
nt|yuval10: still goind down though|pg||
nt|rnmalik: But why the !J@D and not the Ace-education for me|pg||
nt|yuval10: going even|pg||
nt|yuval10: i think he persume that from KT9 (XX) they lead T ( or 9 )|pg||
nt|h_karluk: still believe vs vul fair enough to play aggressive|pg||
nt|yuval10: then if P led from K9XXX and no entries it's very good play|pg||
nt|h_karluk: true|pg||
nt|h_karluk: presumably that's intelligent|pg||
nt|rnmalik: In that case if declarer has AKQ@H there is no defence|pg||
pc|sK|nt|dutcho: well although it looks a bit strange to defend this undoubled I understand both north and south here|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|s6|nt|h_karluk: I recommend you to stay with us, guaranteed to watch many subtle variations, well enough internationals competition there|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sQ|nt|yuval10: indeed, only time it will lose is when declarer has this holding in @d and AKQ@h, together with A@c|pg||
nt|h_karluk: imo this board most probably would not gain anything |pg||
nt|yuval10: but it sounds like too much....perhaps he'd have bid 3@d with such a holding|pg||
nt|xenya: declarer will get 7 trumps, the 1DA and one in the wash i think|pg||

pc|c4|nt|h_karluk: i questioned it to my self and then liked 3@h|pg||
