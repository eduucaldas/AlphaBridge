mb|1S|nt|mcphee: and our first board is 3N|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 1nt with 5@H is usually a good idea|pg||
nt|mcphee: good hand here for 4 suit tranfers|pg||
nt|mcphee: the N player can show @C and then indicate shortness to arrive at the best game|pg||
mb|1N|nt|eleni: This first session (10 boards) is between the teams Veloni-Virvidakis. They both were 5th in their groups|pg||

nt|petrosa: 3NT in the open room|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: all roads lead to 3NT,|pg||
nt|MolvaM: maybe he was planning to find a 4-3 @s fit|pg||

pc|sK|nt|haans: agree|pg||
pc|s7|nt|zoh:  5@c gia na bgoyn prepei na paixei to K@c apo to mort|pg||
nt|MolvaM: after a 2@s response, 4@s would probably a better final spot|pg||
nt|mcphee: i would not allow the @H bid to deter me from leading my 5 card suit|pg||
nt|eleni: This first session (10 boards) is between the teams Panagaki-Virvidakis. They both were 4th and 5th in their groups|pg||

pc|s5|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sJ|nt|eleni: And yes, it is a pairs tourney|pg||
nt|Gerben42: looks like +1, thus beating 5@C|pg||
nt|MolvaM: that explains why north didnt bother looking for a minor suit|pg||
pc|h6|pc|sT|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dA|nt|Gerben42: after the discard should force E to win|pg||

nt|cicus: I am surprised at seeing no 3@C preempt from west|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: I would prefer a 1NT overcall from north here|pg||
nt|Gerben42: with only 2@H, dbl is ok I think|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2C|nt|eleni: The Ladies Mrs.Panagaki and Mrs.Syrakopoulou may lose their @h fit:(|pg||
nt|spyrosm: 5@D= but Fillpos have everything need to balance|pg||
nt|bmkl: hi everyone|pg||
nt|eleni: against Lucas Zotos and Aris Sapounakis (asapou)|pg||

nt|zoh:  2@s?|pg||
nt|mcphee: well 1NT is a choice but with only 2@H dble is much more comfortable|pg||
nt|MolvaM: the problem is, now south will overrate his 7 hcp. |pg||
nt|eleni: on BBO, North is ddiony and South nickd, West is vasso, East doest play on BBO:)|pg||
nt|eleni: Results at the moment are: Levi 88 - Hliapas 91 and Zeis 92.|pg||
nt|haans: support double = show 3 spades|pg||
nt|cicus: coming back with 2@C seems rather purposeless to me|pg||
mb|3H|nt|petrosa: -1  with logical play|pg||
mb|p|nt|bmkl: 2nd half of the Greek Open teams semifinal|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ghionis: 1st swing here i think|pg||
nt|haans: NS not happy|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mcphee: i like this 2@S choice from S|pg||
nt|mcphee: it could easily outscore a minor partial, |pg||
nt|zoh:  duck the King|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: must make since 2@H does not|pg||
nt|eleni: Lucas' name on BBO is zentel|pg||
nt|cicus: hmm, this game is rather thin|pg||
pc|c7|nt|rodal f: So I have the shiny lady Eline who is 5 years older than me. 17Y 408M. There u are specs:)|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|cicus: in fact I would have bid an immediate 2@H instead of 1@S|pg||

nt|cicus: starmen has 2 vp's more|pg||

nt|haans: slamming now????????????????????|pg||
mb|p|nt|zlatan: n guess :)|pg||
mb|5D|nt|Gerben42: 2@C is a tricky bid, now S will think his hand is worse than it is|pg||
nt|Gerben42: playing 2/1 I guess 1NT followed by 4@S is better|pg||
nt|mcphee: well that could lead to a missed slam|pg||
nt|zoh:  To 2@s einai forcing game|pg||
nt|MolvaM: well 3@s is promising|pg||
nt|eleni: so far so good up to now:) good players play the correct contracts in both tables:)|pg||

mb|p|mb|6H|nt|eleni: a most aggressive bid:) at the other table, E-W are simply at 2NT|pg||

nt|Gerben42: no entries for @C@D squeeze|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  depends on what opening 2@c is for EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: the 3@H bid depressed east into 3nt|pg||
pc|c6|nt|doks: nat 6+, but difficult to understand, cc is not in english|pg||
nt|andyv:  the problem with the artificialness of 1@d opener is well illustrated here|pg||
nt|roswolf: missing a 5-4 fit is imo criminal here - but maybe it was a bad hand for the system|pg||
pc|cT|nt|doks: this 1@D opening covers all 11-15 hands, so preemts do a lot of problems|pg||
nt|andyv:  perhaps a negative dbl by W might have worked better|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dT|pc|dJ|nt|roswolf: yup |pg||
pc|d2|pg||

nt|MolvaM: :)|pg||

nt|rodal f: In my eyes a mad 1@D bid when EW ain't limiteded|pg||
nt|cicus: 6@D to be preferred|pg||
mb|p|nt|eleni: after all they are vul|pg||
nt|haans: for sure|pg||
nt|cicus: although it is hard to guess in which suit the opponents can arrange a ruff|pg||

mb|2N|nt|cicus: but you have more @Ds than @Cs|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: no majors|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|petrosa: 2@D=9+|pg||

nt|petrosa: 2@C is FG|pg||

nt|zlatan: just made :)|pg||
nt|cicus: I would not have predicted the 2NT rebid even if I had 5 guesses|pg||
nt|haans: normal to miss this slam|pg||
nt|cicus: you can get there using standard methods by opening 1@C then reversing into @Ds|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: S called the director|pg||
nt|haans: i agree 3nt should have been played by west|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: I'm on the other side of the screen though|pg||

pc|d4|nt|eleni: they always know what they are doing:)|pg||
nt|eleni: Taso, by the end of this tournament, Frank will speak Greek:)|pg||
nt|lelos: 50 years ago this would be a passed out board i think|pg||
nt|rodal f: Ain't we happy that things have happen at the bridge:)|pg||
nt|eleni: Taso 50 years ago anyone would have opened 1@h with E's hand:):) dreadful but true|pg||
nt|rodal f: Will it end -1 or -2 by a @S ruff and miss the @D?|pg||
nt|lelos: i think down 2|pg||
nt|rodal f: Didn't the say min 13HP by that time Eleni? So 12HP ain't good enough|pg||
nt|eleni: ohhhhhhhhhhhhh Nickkkkkkkkkkkkkk pls play|pg||
nt|rodal f: The nick name was Nick?:)|pg||
nt|eleni: nickd|pg||
nt|eleni: and yes Frank 12 and a dbltn|pg||
nt|rodal f: Still it was 13HP. Later they conted doubbletons etc.|pg||
nt|eleni: remember pls our good old Goren:):)|pg||
nt|rodal f: But by that time not with a honor included. It came later.|pg||
nt|eleni: and then Albarran and his 5-cards majors and canape|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: Director called by W for delay by S|pg||
nt|lelos: this is standard for N/S|pg||
nt|eleni: South, Nick is still thinking:)|pg||
pc|dT|nt|MolvaM: I expect many players to open the east hand, then hard to stop before 3nt|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|mcphee: our E is hoping to win the J in hand|pg||
pc|s5|nt|petrosa: after this lead he wii not make it|pg||

nt|rodal f: WD|pg||
nt|eleni: was worth the thinking?|pg||
nt|jcone: P misclicked?   now makes |pg||
pc|d5|nt|mcphee: another good think about splitting the @S honors is N is more likely to return the suit if they win it\|pg||
nt|MolvaM: so making 2nt will be a good score I expect|pg||
nt|mcphee: N should find the @D shift now I think|pg||

nt|eleni: only on a similar play Murat:)|pg||
nt|mcphee: i would be delighted with 180 myself|pg||
nt|Gerben42: maybe ...|pg||
nt|MolvaM: difficult to play diamonds after east opens 1@d|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: 2min break|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 1@D is almost a psyche *g|pg||
nt|eleni: a 75% score for our Ladies here, one can say|pg||
nt|mcphee: well that is true, but on the @C play S shows not interest so what is left?|pg||
nt|eleni: you are so right Bob|pg||
nt|MolvaM: but eleni said they all play udca no?|pg||
nt|zoh:  Nai ta koritsia piran 2 poly kala score apo 2 poly kaloys paiktes|pg||
nt|eleni: yes Murat, they do|pg||
nt|mcphee: if they play usdca S carded wrong|pg||
nt|MolvaM: if udca, then south must have liked the @c shift. hence north continued the attack|pg||
nt|MolvaM: so north is innocent|pg||
nt|eleni: he might have false carded though, just to mic up the girls|pg||
nt|Gerben42: they were very mixed up|pg||
nt|mcphee: but, crafty E is so proud her 2@D bid worked out so well:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: At operating seat, John Manios, new addition to our vugraph team :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|Gerben42: East knows that pd never has anything|pg||

mb|3C|nt|cicus: 2nT might be the key bid although I don't know its meaning|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|petrosa: one down is good bridge|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|Gerben42: @D is right? @S counts more|pg||

mb|p|pc|s6|nt|rodal f: Wander if the X and X from N made S belive more HPs at N. Don't have there CC|pg||

pc|c3|nt|cicus: looked like N was short in @Ds|pg||

nt|animeshraj: or want to..|pg||
nt|animeshraj: very nicely thought out by him,,, and he was well on his way to  .. glory|pg||

nt|Gerben42: but can understnad 3NT bid after pd shows my two short suits|pg||
nt|eleni: The boys are not members of her club:)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: south hopes that @d finesse is off and everyone else gets a @s lead|pg||
nt|mcphee: perhaps S with such good @C could advance with 4@C, but at pairs this seems not that wise|pg||
