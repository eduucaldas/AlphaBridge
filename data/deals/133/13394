nt|Walddk2: This is a wrong setup|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You crashed, np, but when you came back you started a new broadcast of your own|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You must shut down and connect to the other table|pg||
mb|2D|mb|d|mb|p|nt|miketedd: NS have a lucky 4@H which they are unlikely to bid|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|miketedd: Things lie badly for EW, so they will probably go 2 off for a flat board|pg||
nt|simonr: Declarer will be disappointed to find both @S honours with North as this will drift a couple off|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|simonr: possibly three off if they negotiate a diamond ruff|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am sorrty, but we are not getting any comparisons in this set|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Apparently, the operator is inexperienced and does not have time to read what I write|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Alternatively, there is no-one to supervise|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||
nt|simonr: Need to switch to a @d to get three off now|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h2|pc|hT|nt|Walddk2: Due to travel difficulties (vulcano ash   closed airspace), the weekend has been shortened to just Saturday and Sunday with 12 boards per segment (rather than 16). No bridge Friday ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: because the Irish teams were stranded on the island|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Last time that happened was when the Pompeii cricket team had to cancel, year 39 BC|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|simonr: One off now!|pg||
pc|sT|pc|h9|pc|c2|pg||
nt|miketedd: Because Beth played back the @H8, Sheila thinks declarer has the 9 ...|pg||

nt|idc: a good idea, especially at this time in the morning|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|idc: bridge at 10am is unnatural|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@S went 2 down on board 1 at the other table, so 2 IMPs to Wales|pg||
nt|Walddk2: ON this board Scotland has 600 in 3NT|pg||
nt|simonr: A kibber tells me it was two down in the other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|idc: I suspect N 1@c, S 1@d, N 1NT|pg||
mb|1C|nt|simonr: No!|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I just can't bear passing that South hand throughout|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I also think North should get involved|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1NT over 1@C|pg||
nt|simonr: 1@C by North is more realistic|pg||
mb|1D|nt|simonr: Some would have overcalled 1NT as North|pg||
mb|p|nt|simonr: Don't like 1NT by South with a 6-4 shape now|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|miketedd: Is this really the auction?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|c7|nt|simonr: That's better|pg||
nt|idc: hey, one correct prediction - my weekend average reached by 10:25|pg||
nt|miketedd: Presumably 1NT is 15-17.  South should surely try for game|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Passing 1NT would not be an option for me|pg||
