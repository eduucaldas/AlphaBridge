pc|s8|pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pc|s9|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dA|nt|cicus: N should have subsided by 5@D, S won't bid a 5-card suit in this situation|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d2|pg||
nt|ady: 5@H going down     |pg||
nt|ady: yes I agree|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I prefer to pass 5@d with North|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Partner will not usually pull the double without shape|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  And with a 2 suiter can bid 4NT|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  So likely to have long diamonds|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  And obviously no guarantee he has any hearts at all|pg||
nt|cicus: true, when vulnerable, he bids to make|pg||
nt|cicus: if no attractive contact of his own at the 5 level, he simply passes and hopes to set them|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ady: 5 diamonds can be made   if east leads a spade and west switches to a club  the ace can be played   2 rounds of diamonds and when they dont break as long as the defender with the ...|pg||
nt|ady: queen of diamonds has 3 hearts the club can be pitched on the 4th heart   just lose 1 spade and 1 diamond|pg||

mb|p|nt|rodal f: Hi Cornelia:))@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: think 4@S get the contract|pg||

mb|2S|nt|rodal f: 3 card X support I belive|pg||
nt|haans: may be 0-5 hcp of upgraded 6+|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|vugraphzgn: yes|pg||
nt|chick: NS have the majority of points, but very poor choice of suits/strain|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|chick: EW only 19 HCP and flatish, but at least they have a playable suit |pg||
nt|chick: in any case, game is too high for either side I think|pg||
nt|rodal f: As NS have at 3NT with a @H lead|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|chick: we shall see if S can pull this off :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: There I agree by u totaly.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Still it seems to become a 1IMP in NS by -1 at 3NT|pg||
nt|rodal f: 3@H=|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: S asked something from W and is thinking now|pg||
nt|rodal f: But Smight want to go for it and get some exsta bonus -:)|pg||
nt|chick: there are actually ways to make this ... finessing club for 6 clubs, then spade finesse (now just knock out the K later), and playing the @H10 when hearts are led|pg||
nt|mmmakela: I wouldn't mind being in 6 dias, though failing this time|pg||
nt|haans: to little hearts to make that|pg||
mb|5S|nt|rodal f: I was so total wrong.|pg||

mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  On the last hand, after ruffing the diamond, West needed to play a spade and force dummy to ruff|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Otherwise declarer can take a trump finesse through East creating an extra entry to set up the diamonds|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|rodal f: A pre emp3@H|pg||
nt|chick: E alerted his 1@D opening, so I believe it does not promise much about diamonds|pg||

mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|ady: 4@S unlucky in CR|pg||

mb|3S|mb|p|nt|cicus: now it would be played from the right hand|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|ady: natural to get to gamed in 8 card spade fit|pg||
nt|cicus: relay system uncovering the exect distribution prevail in this area|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|cicus: spades will also be played from S, so a helpful @D lead and it makes|pg||
nt|ady: not sure why south did not just bid 4@S one round earlier    surely not looking for anything more?|pg||
nt|cicus: but W seems to have a safe-looking @H lead|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I guess North is unlimited though|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: now even on a diamond lead this cant make|pg||

pc|d7|pc|d3|pc|dK|nt|ady: good pre-empt at the vulnerability by north   did not expect 4 clubs to be passed out    west worried double is take-out and east may just have diamonds and any action may result ...|pg||
nt|ady: in a minus|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  North lucky to escape undoubled in 4@c|pg||

pc|s3|pc|sA|pc|sT|pc|s4|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d5|mc|6|nt|cicus: some play that 4-level overcall creates a forcing pass situation|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  There is plenty of work to do in 4@h though|pg||
