pc|dA|pc|h5|pc|d8|nt|joest: if I was west and heard partner bid 4@h i'd be disappointed to go down :)|pg||

pc|h9|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|rhelle: East has even less than that, so he has no reason to bid 4@h, IMHO|pg||
nt|rhelle: oh yes - very nice|pg||
nt|cicus: kibs also suggested this play|pg||
nt|joest: plus the spades lie nicely so he can roll this home|pg||
nt|rhelle: of course, seeing North have AK of D pinpoints the other honours|pg||
nt|joest: yes|pg||
nt|xenya: and N is likely to have 2 hearts rather than 3, so the intrafinesse seems indicated|pg||
nt|rhelle: I'm still impressed with the speed at which he found it - not an everyday play|pg||

mb|2D|nt|ralfwil: Good afternoon everybody|pg||
mb|d|nt|panja: 4@h will make because @C K is in..not easy to bid though|pg||
nt|rnmalik: very friendly lay out of cards for EW at NT but difficult to bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: major power break here this is the only laptop working|pg||

mb|p|nt|panja: @DKQ seem like wasted values..|pg||
mb|2H|nt|Walddk4: Good morning everyone and welcome back to the Netherlands for a practise match between the host team and Russia. Three segments of 20 boards today|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Four pairs in each team. We have four of them at our visible tables (open and closed room) and another four at two "invisible" tables in order to give new operators some practise|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello Shirley, Mike and Marc|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: first set 37-4 Russia. Score not carried forward? |pg||

mb|3D|nt|kareno: Fixed!!|pg||
nt|sharkey: Well done!|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello all and welcome|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Good judgement, @D better than @H|pg||
nt|roswolf: tasty hand to start|pg||
nt|sharkey: E need to switch to @H when in on @C first time to set this|pg||
nt|sharkey: assumed @D lead....|pg||
nt|sharkey: makes now|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm not the best lead but it is the first board of the day and a Sunday as well:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: I checked once more as he has @D8 too and the light is bad but it is really @H8|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Brink Drijver (a strong pair) use 5 Maj 5@D (except 4441), 2@C - Game Forcing is 2@C, 2@D@H@S weak with interesting auction after 2Maj open|pg||
nt|roswolf: ty giorio|pg||
nt|roswolf: giorgio- sorry|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: I am sitting close to Bas Drijver who is usually very helpfull in giving explanations to the audience|pg||
nt|roswolf: declarer in deep thought!?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: yes, still thinking|pg||
nt|sharkey: @C9 a key card too|pg||
nt|bridge_one: they use also 1NT open in first not vuln 9/12 (else 15/17) - multilandy vs NT but with 2@H/@S interesting hand also witouth minor out|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @C looks like "weak in @D" or strong |pg||
mb|3H|nt|Walddk4: Our operator is Marc van Beijsterveldt|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Your commentators Bill Jacobs and Jacco Hop|pg||

nt|h_karluk: if original multi i play = a) weak 2 majors b) 2NT (19-21 balanced with 4/5 cards) c) any 4441 then I cannot pass as North. On the other hand with 4 cards at the other major that's ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: an irregular opening bid. Pass fine with me.|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: sorry missed the play ...|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Was it alerted, I think alertable call that I have @D|pg||
nt|stewball: 2@d likely = @h|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://nbbuitslagen.transfer-solutions.com/uss/goPage14.do?rndid=76228&verid=778&catid= for detailed results|pg||
nt|lestergold: Ive seen a lot of this young Dutch pair but I am unfamiliar with the Russians |pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: moreover multi 2@d defense is not a very hard to remember tool|pg||
mb|p|nt|harmon: ty Jan|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 2@D transfer, 2@s=break (good heart fit) |pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: explanation was asked and given but could not understand|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Ralf |pg||
nt|ralfwil: Hello Shirley!|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: 482 - 484 imps in favor of Russia, 12 boards (at four tables so two matches) to play|pg||

pc|sK|nt|sybarra: welcome Jean Harings|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: dag Jean|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Hello Jean!|pg||
nt|jeanhari: VErhees had second thoughts over 3@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: how do you know? He expressed that at the table indeed.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Looks like E can make|pg||
nt|jeanhari: 10 tricks not possible cause of the pss. spade ruff|pg||
pc|sA|nt|jcwla: Not sure what the double of 4@D is -- some pairs play "double up" or "double down" of splinters asking for leads of low/high side suits.  Maybe not on same wavelength here.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|hawe45:  No - the russians are very fair|pg||
nt|mdgraham: followed by 4@D either splinter or (more likely) transfer at the four-level|pg||
nt|Walddk4: There is another match taking place simultaneously, so they are going to calculate an aggregate score by the end of the day I suppose|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Four pairs in each team. We have four of them at our visible tables (open and closed room) and another four at two "invisible" tables in order to give new operators some practise|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: imps are converted to VP and added up for both matches|pg||

pc|h9|nt|vugraphzgq: Welcome from the 'bridge farm' 't Onstein in Vorden|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Good afternoon|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: slight delay in start because 4 Dutch players arrived a little late :-(|pg||
nt|panja: 4@D was a shot in the dark, it seems like....but N has three useful honours, @HAK and @CQ...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: thanks|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: this one was 24-6 to Russia, the other is not finished yet :-(|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|jeanhari: otherwise hearts could be played for one loser|pg||
nt|sybarra: note they are playing low /high with doubleton |pg||
pc|d8|nt|Vugraphzfb: OF course not :)|pg||

pc|h6|nt|kareno: Brogeland sitting over Helness this time, however |pg||
pc|hK|nt|harmon: they switched rooms too|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: diamond and the director was called to establish the revoke and we're continuing|pg||
pc|hA|nt|kareno: The way this works, spectators, is that for a given set, one team sits first then the seeded team sits where they like.  The seed passes from team to team according to the ...|pg||
nt|kareno: conditions of contest, each team being seeded for two quarters.|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Director has ruled that there is a 1 trick penalty for the revoke.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Still the question is: Have Boye and Silla made up a psycologic against Geir and Tor?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Brogeland asks whether he could have asked and is told that he could have.|pg||
nt|sharkey: Fatigue factor coming into play perhaps - late in the contest|pg||
pc|cA|nt|panja: the rules have changed in 2007 edition, especially re revoke|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c6|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Vladimir Ivanov|pg||

nt|stewball: trump at trick 2 doesnt look that challenging but Jansma had something else in mind it seems|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Hi|pg||
nt|stewball: not clear what that was....|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|jcwla: Another possibility is to use "double up/down" when vul but dbl suggesting a sac when not vul.  As between double up or down, there is a slight theoretical advantage to down b/c ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: you _could_ bid the up suit at the same level.|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: EW now discussing the meaning of the double|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: they decide that further discussion is needed :-)|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sA|nt|xenya: 3@C promised at least 3 cards i think, hence 5@C|pg||
pc|s6|nt|rhelle: which means that pass over 5@c = I don't want to go on|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pg||
nt|joest: how to treat north's double is an interesting partnership questoin|pg||
nt|rhelle: now 2 rounds of trumps|pg||
nt|joest: does it guarantee another call?   obviously north-south play that it doesn't|pg||
nt|rhelle: North X = GF, with no specific bid|pg||
nt|cicus: it created a GF so pass over 5@C was forcing|pg||
nt|rhelle: over 5C pass = forcing. Double would mean: I want to go on|pg||
nt|joest: thats true.  forgot that 1@c was forcing, sorry|pg||
nt|cicus: so they play pass/X inversion|pg||
nt|rhelle: they have reversed the meaning of Pass and X in that situation|pg||
nt|rhelle: indeed :)|pg||
nt|cicus: a relatively new concept, spreading rapidly|pg||

nt|vugraphzgq: NS play 3way 1@C, 1@D 4+ may have longer @C 5cr M (9-16 HCP), 'destructive 2-level op.'|pg||

nt|roswolf: 3@H is a mysterious effort|pg||
nt|lestergold: now is the time for a close game to be bid |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzgq: I guess S takes 2@C as Stay or so?|pg||

mb|4S|nt|vugraphzgq: E asks and N says 'short'|pg||
nt|roswolf: curiouser and curiouser|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: the axe should fall|pg||
nt|bridge_one: kholomeev-khyuppenen use a classic 2/1 approach with any difference: 2@C also weak with @d, 2@D open = bal 18/19 (italian style) to have 1minor => 2Nt natural long suit strong ...|pg||
nt|bridge_one: hand, xefrt walsh after 1@C open, 1Nt response semiforcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: apparently the 2@C bid was not availbable here -- for some reason  |pg||
nt|h_karluk: mini roman also suitable for east's collection|pg||
nt|sybarra: bids one more time?|pg||
nt|sybarra: hand is huge in some ways |pg||
nt|jeanhari: west can't be sure of any fit, that's the problem|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a cheap save in 5@c|pg||
mb|5C|nt|rnmalik: 2@S and a @D|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this is an aggressive contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: E in the tank|pg||
nt|hawe45:  He will find nothing there|pg||
nt|mdgraham: maybe I am too old, but 3@S seems pushing it a bit on that East hand - maybe 2@S would have meant something different|pg||
nt|jcwla: I agree with you, Mike.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: what, about being too old?|pg||
nt|jcwla: Yes, did you say something else?|pg||
nt|panja: 3@S is certainly a self-preempting bid, W has to P or bid game...in essence, guess|pg||
nt|hawe45:  So do I, but West could have had the right values, @d-values are not interesting.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://nbbuitslagen.transfer-solutions.com/uss/goPage14.do?rndid=76228&verid=778&catid=  for results|pg||

nt|rnmalik: yes and it makes key cards are very nicely placed.|pg||
nt|sybarra: the spade bid should give a hint as to placement |pg||
nt|lestergold: very lucky to have @dK with North the hearts playing for no loser|pg||
mb|d|nt|hawe45:  But to me, this is a contract, you might play a little faster|pg||

mb|p|nt|mdgraham: ah, double shows spades. So 2@s would be four-card support, 12-14-ish. 3@S looks better in that case.|pg||
nt|sharkey: sounds to me like EW have beein misinformed?|pg||

nt|xenya: yes|pg||

pc|s6|nt|roswolf: quite possible - although east made an anti% bid imo|pg||
pc|s8|nt|lestergold: but its not qa bad game if you expect to lose a heart a spade and a club it would be basically on the dim finesse|pg||
nt|lestergold: the heart position the only one to mean no loser is of course very fortuitous|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|chessmaste: The opening bid is in a style that the Italians like to play, but it was probably invented in the 40's by Marjorie Burns as part of the Nottingham Club|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Verhees: "well played"|pg||
nt|h_karluk: long tranches without sound reason, some attention needed by TDs|pg||
nt|jeanhari: -300 likely as diamonds dont break|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|panja: perhaps, a stronger invitation than 3@C might have been more apppropriate..but what that could be is difficult to judge|pg||
pc|c2|nt|kareno: West's is not a really attractive hand.  I think 3@c was enough.|pg||
nt|sharkey: 5@C OR|pg||
nt|panja: how did the bidding go?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1Nt for other minor ( or other major ) and 4cards maj is a gadget loved by netherland pair|pg||
nt|roswolf: cashing out in defence is one of the under practised arts of the game|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Instead Russian pair use 1NT overcall natural|pg||
nt|sharkey: cant see any tricks vanish here Geoff|pg||
nt|bridge_one: so possible to see the swings for this reason|pg||
nt|roswolf: true but it saves thinking time|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s4|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|sybarra: on the right track |pg||
pc|d4|nt|mdgraham: one good thing about transfer responses to 1@C is that they do help to identify the nature of the fit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: which can be very useful in competitive auctions|pg||
nt|h_karluk: yes but very slow tempo|pg||
nt|sybarra: tough to not save on this hand I think |pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|h_karluk: if that was a club level game between oldies in a degree it could be acceptable. But that's an international event! Sorry, "technically" not nice.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|h_karluk: The right thing to do for NS is to call TD, point out what's going on at the table to preserve their rights in case alloted time exceeded|pg||
pc|d6|nt|lestergold: we can see what he feared|pg||
nt|sybarra: but not an easy hand |pg||
nt|sybarra: so is ok |pg||
pc|d5|pc|dK|pg||
nt|sybarra: club on the table next |pg||
nt|jeanhari: there is a poss line for -100|pg||
nt|ralfwil: An old truth . it´s never fault to do the right thing:)|pg||
pc|sA|pc|c6|nt|jeanhari: by playing diamonds from the table, south not inserting the king but taht's all double dummy|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lestergold: heart wsrong club back then spade and then maybe a trump prmoted and then what about the diamonds|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|sybarra: looks like they can beat 4 @S but how to know? |pg||
pc|d8|pc|dT|nt|sybarra: or is it too late after @H ruff?|pg||

pc|h5|pc|h3|nt|vugraphzgq: TD called now|pg||
nt|roswolf: declarer will be shifting in his chair now|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Brink says indeed that 2@C has been explained as majors|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: N says no agreements over this type of 1NT so intended 2@C as natural|pg||
nt|bridge_one: normaly, in this situation, N/S arn't penalized|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: sorry short break as EW have no cc and Bas is now going to print one from his mailbox|pg||
nt|roswolf: this just sounds like a general mix-up|pg||
nt|sharkey: good job keeping us informed Marc|pg||

mb|p|nt|sharkey: surprised no cc on in place...|pg||

mb|p|nt|hawe45:  A sporty 3 @H - rea against black/green|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It'a bid only its mother could love|pg||
nt|dutcho: 3@H is typical NV/V preempt|pg||
nt|bjacobs: really?  "typical"?|pg||
nt|xenya: 1@H -2@C-2@H -?|pg||
nt|sybarra: which I think they will take |pg||
nt|andyv:  yes, since 4@s makes easily, even with the ruff|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: 2@S explained by N and S as 'weak two'|pg||
pc|h5|nt|roswolf: looks like a grand slam day|pg||
nt|lestergold: iront is that n/s have the balance of points but e/w can make gane|pg||
nt|andyv:  sure looks more like Polish 2@s bid|pg||
nt|jeanhari: not the best contract here, north chossing not to als for the minor |pg||
nt|ralfwil: These openings can destroy a game, like this 5@c on NS|pg||
pc|h4|nt|hawe45:  red|pg||
nt|bridge_one: pass in east bec vuln|pg||
pc|h7|nt|harmon: they bid a game on finesse not worth discussing|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no double from East, not expecting West to contribute much to the defence|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Right solution|pg||
nt|hawe45:  A trump-lead would - as almost always is the case - kill the contract, IÂ´m sure|pg||
nt|dutcho: Might be poor choice of words Bill|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|stewball: i expect E will get his @s in|pg||
nt|sharkey: can they get to slam here?|pg||
nt|roswolf: the 4-0 trump break may be troublesome|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: this is a very profitable save :-)|pg||
nt|lestergold: well driver does not have much defence so this could be a very good board for the Rissians|pg||
nt|sybarra: in category of "render unto caesar" ...more profitable now without X |pg||
pc|s4|nt|panja: something wrong here..|pg||
nt|harmon: uhhm quit the bidding for NS|pg||
nt|panja: a P by brogeland to begin perhaps|pg||
nt|sharkey: 2@d-2@s-2 nt-3@c-5@c|pg||
nt|mdgraham: quiet contract |pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: little confusion as the 2@D card was missing|pg||
nt|bjacobs: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: break in tempo was with North|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 5@S will be interesting ... it might just make|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Although probably not|pg||
nt|xenya: and he did|pg||
nt|dutcho: like he did|pg||
nt|stewball: 4@s surely|pg||
nt|xenya: um -- KJ of hearts don't look too nice...|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|chessmaste: Declarer will win this and probably play a diamond|pg||
nt|panja: regulation lead|pg||
nt|jcwla: :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @D 7 is better|pg||
nt|panja: oh, I thought @D7 was led....|pg||
nt|panja: wasn't that the card that was showing earlier?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: it was a combination of bad light and misclick :-)|pg||
nt|roswolf: see no reason why not|pg||
pc|sT|nt|bjacobs: North might have to neutralize dummy's diamonds by playing 3 rounds of the suit|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: he has a @D in hand now ...|pg||
nt|xenya: so a cautious 3|pg||
nt|stewball: the rest makes up for it|pg||
nt|bridge_one: East use a prudent approach, because know they are a terrible distribution, so don't give informations at opps|pg||
nt|jeanhari: mostly not best choosing a trump suit with four losers :)|pg||
nt|jeanhari: but we all did it before....|pg||
nt|sybarra: sure looks more like wk 2 suiter,  but with no movement by N,  maybe not |pg||
nt|jeanhari: certainly south not promised 5 of a minor|pg||
nt|jeanhari: best for west to continue  hearts|pg||
pc|c8|nt|Vugraphzfb: Sorry, I was trying to get the other match fixed, hope I succeeded|pg||
nt|sharkey: So Zimmermann will regain the lead|pg||
nt|panja: 6@D here..touch and go|pg||
nt|harmon: yes he claims on any lead|pg||
nt|panja: @ST..boosts it to an easy make|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup silence is golden on this hand|pg||
nt|sharkey: South's cue shud be all N need here - may get too high?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: But seven @h are ON bec West have all small @H ... a J10xx was sufficient to beat the grand slam|pg||
pc|c2|nt|chessmaste: Now he must play a trump|pg||
pc|c5|nt|panja: the problem for W is, he has too much strength in @H..and he now knows E is short|pg||
nt|sharkey: This is the final session of the semi finals - 14 boards to go|pg||
nt|xenya: well done|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
pc|s5|nt|chessmaste: leaving declarer a trick short|pg||
nt|jcwla: One often leads a trump against preference auctions.  Here, E has preferred @D's over @S's with the pass of 2@D.  However, N's weak @S length suggested a different lead to him.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|hawe45:  The finesse here has no sense|pg||
pc|cA|nt|dutcho: 3@S looks right with the west cards|pg||
nt|xenya: 5@D NS is not such a bad save but they got nowhere near it|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - shud make|pg||
nt|roswolf: well north knows things fit well and has all the controls - might gamble on the doubleton spade in south's hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: the final bid was a bit agricultural|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|lestergold: Driver does not expect 2 hearts to be stabding up on this auction|pg||
nt|jeanhari: now east must play a heart |pg||
nt|jeanhari: more difficult|pg||
pc|d3|nt|bridge_one: North closure at 6 may be too much fast - the space to take other informations there are (any minor K was excellet for North)|pg||
pc|d8|nt|kareno: Why touch and go?|pg||
nt|harmon: hell cash Q of d 1st in case d's 4-0|pg||
nt|panja: good or lucky? a very think line between the two.....@SJ and @ST are not what bidding unearths, yet, without them, there would be no slam|pg||
nt|harmon: not touch and go thats just blather|pg||

nt|xenya: other room started with 19 and 20|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|andyv:  1@s dbld is not a great contract for EW|pg||
nt|jeanhari: could have been a good game.. but not in hearts, 3NT will make for sure|pg||
pc|h5|nt|sharkey: Zimmermann originally seeded 16 (now 1); Strul originally 12 (5)|pg||
nt|sharkey: For seeding brackets http://www.acbl.org/nabc/brackets/2010/01/vanderbilt/|pg||
nt|kareno: Seems like Strul was underseeded.|pg||
nt|kareno: Zimmermann too|pg||
nt|rodal f: Non of them surpriced me. Some might remember Zimmerman in Rio.|pg||
nt|sharkey: hard to seed when you look at the start list|pg||
nt|harmon: they probably need to change the seeding with so many european players now coming to nationals|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Khven was just mucking around with 2@D - unfortunately, his opps turned nasty|pg||
pc|h2|nt|hlortz: yes the ACB|pg||
nt|hlortz: acbl seeding formula not good for foreign pairs always|pg||
nt|h_karluk: S has a big after p's opening|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes (see above)  was just a matter of which slam |pg||
nt|lestergold: has 13 tricks hearts breaking without dim finesse|pg||
pc|hT|nt|mdgraham: South possibly afraid of 3NT, and too happy with 3@H to double - still, if EW were going to bid 3NT they would have done |pg||
nt|bjacobs: Worst case - he is in -500 territory|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|h3|nt|bjacobs: The defence might need to find a spade ruff - not too easy|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: that were my words not his|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Jansma announces he hopes there is a plan B|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sharkey: On the two tables in this match the US players are not present|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|pg||
nt|kareno: Yes, ACBL needs to account for some of the foreign teams which have had good results elsewhere.|pg||
nt|sharkey: Four world champiuons this table|pg||
nt|panja: the problem is how do you assess 'good results elsewhere'?|pg||
nt|panja: with a 5422 hand and just 7 HCP.....what is the % that 1nt is the best spot? Quite high, I would think!!|pg||
pc|d3|nt|hlortz: perhaps give weight to wbf rankings|pg||
nt|panja: bridge should have a rating systtem like chess|pg||
nt|rnmalik: test|pg||
nt|jeanhari: would be 500 indeed, but not easy for north to pass 1@S doubled |pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|nt|vugraphzgq: nice example of the known card|pg||

pc|sK|nt|yuval10: how many players would've X with S's hand?|pg||
nt|yuval10: he did exceptionally well by not doing just that|pg||
nt|rnmalik: That is true and agree|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I hope there is a time allotted to a board Marc, I am basically a fast player but this too slow|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: yes you'r right. open room played 4 extra boards and has catched up already|pg||
nt|yuval10: declarer try to figure out a way to make it|pg||
pc|s4|nt|lestergold: claim7 now|pg||
nt|h_karluk: push next board please - game over|pg||
pc|c3|nt|vugraphzgq: only 100 per trick|pg||

mb|1C|an|16+|mb|1D|an|4+!Ds 0+pts|nt|rhelle: lol!|pg||
nt|joest: east has described his hand quite well|pg||
nt|cicus: he has extras|pg||
nt|rhelle: now Muller will bid 1H, I think|pg||
mb|1S|an|4+!Hs|mb|2S|nt|rhelle: ah yes, they have reversed the 1H and 1@s bids|pg||
nt|cicus: hopefuly both of them|pg||
mb|3H|nt|rhelle: so 1@s = 4+@h and GF|pg||
nt|joest: north has great hearts but lots of strength in the opponents suits|pg||
nt|joest: diamonds being a psuedo-suit :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: Yes both know the correct meaning|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I guess one can debate the virtue of that 1@D overcall|pg||
mb|3S!|mb|4D|nt|joest: let's see what Rudakov has in mind.  If 4@d invites a save, he'll defend against 4@h.  But if he then saves himself, I'll wonder why he didn't bid 5@d just now|pg||
nt|cicus: or a round before|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rhelle: Yes, I'm puzzled ... als by 3@s from South. 4@c seems to describe the hand better|pg||
nt|joest: I like 4@c too assuming it doesn't have some meaning we don't know about|pg||
nt|rhelle: true - who knows, maybe 3@s is a transfer to @c|pg||
nt|joest: :)|pg||
nt|rhelle: I have their system notes in front of me, but this is too detailed |pg||
nt|rhelle: to recap: 1@s showed 4+ @h,and is GF|pg||
nt|joest: now in similar situations do the panelists here play that 4@h is weaker than pass or vice versa?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The good thing about having Muller at the table (other than he is a fine player) is that the operator won't get exhausted because he bids or plays too fast|pg||
nt|rhelle: so the pass over 4@d is 100% forcing and shows extras|pg||
nt|rhelle: actually it's a fine slam if the opps don't cash their aces|pg||
nt|xenya: you may have doubts about thec 1@D overcall, Roland, but you can't deny it has led to an interesting auction|pg||
nt|cicus: I am still of the old school of regarding the immediate bid as weaker|pg||
mb|4N!|mb|p|mb|5D!|mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|nt|rhelle: 5@d shows 3 aces|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I agree, Vladimir, very interesting indeed|pg||
nt|joest: i thought that was the new school :)|pg||
nt|rhelle: of the 5|pg||
nt|cicus: I am not that old Jack|pg||
nt|joest: 4NT must have been something other than RKCB if north is thinking it over|pg||
nt|rhelle: I was young before this auction started|pg||
nt|joest: old school = "when I am weak I pass"|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: Earlier today it showed extras and a lack of control in a bid suit|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rhelle: the problem for North is that 1@s showed at least 2 controls - i.e. an ace or 2 kings|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle: and he simply cannot believe that it is 2 kings|pg||
nt|joest: yet partner signed off over Blackwood.  Who to believe?  Muller A or Muller B?|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dQ|pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
pc|sA|mc|11|nt|Walddk2: Let me tell you this. It would have taken my club members less time to avoid a slam off two cashing aces. You really need to be a World Class player to encounter a disaster like ...|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: I need to go deal witih the other match - I'll try to get the auction and result on this hand when I get back - very sorry|pg||
nt|sharkey: how wud you do that Prakash?|pg||
nt|sharkey: Wudnt mind being an underdog with these players on the team :)|pg||
nt|panja: you have to take a stand that it must be there...|pg||
nt|panja: there is enough data available, and mathematics is stronge enough to handle the issue if there is will|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Still he had to play low - if he led @SQ, then declarer, knowing there no problems in spades, would have just played trumps|pg||
nt|bridge_one: after 2@C open it work very well to use the rule that 4NT by responder isn't Blkw but cue to give particular hands|pg||
nt|rnmalik: test|pg||
mb|1H|nt|chessmaste: This looks to have potential|pg||
nt|rnmalik: action hand|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Funny boards ...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: big double-fit here.|pg||
nt|dutcho: That is correct, I just was trying to tell it from the prospective of Jansma|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  E/W has the best spot, non-vuln. and with majors|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Still many mis-fits|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 22/18 balanced layout|pg||
nt|roswolf: west will no doubt run for the hills|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: there is no alert, Brink shows his muscles when asked about the meaning|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 14 hcp but 5 cards minor, so the strong of the hand is 15 - for this reason i agree to open 1Nt|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: ... of the double|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Dbl by East is signed natural in the CC|pg||
nt|sybarra: do "we" fly into 4 @H?|pg||
nt|jeanhari: I won't|pg||
nt|sybarra: or a slower approach?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|chessmaste: I prefer West's majors|pg||
nt|mdgraham: slam making both ways...|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Undo - or a tactical 2 @H!|pg||
nt|dutcho: always nice 6 card support|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So where do you go with West?  4@D?  5@D?  Or something imaginative?|pg||
nt|lestergold: well Dutch turn for slam? not quite as easy tho|pg||
mb|d|nt|vugraphzgq: he bid 2@H|pg||
nt|rnmalik: now comes 4NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Gromov in the tank|pg||
nt|h_karluk: I agree with 1NT there|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: no bid available for two splinters :-)|pg||
nt|andyv:  to the airways|pg||
nt|jeanhari: but it will work here|pg||
mb|r|nt|panja: strong....even|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Obviously that was not the auction, sorry, but hopefully I got things straightened out and will be here for the rest of the quarter|pg||
nt|harmon: what is Chip doing to mess things up???|pg||
nt|rodal f: My son. U are forgiven:)|pg||
nt|sharkey: The other match is a battle of Swedes vs USA|pg||
nt|roswolf: south chickens out first|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: supposedly some EW activity as 2@h last resort|pg||
nt|yuval10: W think about raising|pg||
nt|stewball: sympathies go to our Polish members|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
nt|dutcho: indeed |pg||
nt|dutcho: low spade or high spade?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: also agree with 2@c|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6@h not bad could be in trouble on a trump lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: wonder if this is "junk stayman" |pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: elsewhere, rating has been attempted..and has been somewhat of a success even in its rudimentary form...I would not like to dwell more on that here though|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: :) :) But I can't blame it on him, the operators got confused|pg||
nt|sybarra: and if so now what?|pg||
nt|jeanhari: that redbl makes it easyer for east to bid?|pg||
nt|sybarra: pass should be forcing |pg||
mb|d|nt|kareno: That's fine, Rodal, but Jan is definitely a woman.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: If 2@H is weak, it's quite a good weak |pg||
nt|dutcho: down 2|pg||
nt|yuval10: quite naturally, 2@h can be made with some stronger-than-minimum hands with a poor suit|pg||
nt|bridge_one: conservative 2@S by South - finding a good raise probably he know north don't pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|chessmaste: If West bids 5@H South might go on to 6@D|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1NT=F1|pg||
nt|dutcho: NS could make 5@C|pg||
nt|rnmalik: can make 9 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: where?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Jansma bids 2@H but software restrictions do not permit me to do the same|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @H|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that's smolen there|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 @S=more hts than spades (I think like puppet) |pg||
nt|sybarra: it is smolen|pg||
nt|h_karluk: http://www.bridgeguys.com/Conventions/Smolen.html|pg||
nt|lestergold: note that 6n is a great slam---- when the diamonds break 3/3 that is....|pg||
nt|lestergold: Roland would dfeinitely be in a slam here|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think Brink has a tough bid now |pg||
nt|lestergold: Hard decision for Brink here|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 4@h auto|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: South will be wondering where the spades are |pg||
nt|hawe45:  D = 0 or 2?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: dbl is interest in bidding on|pg||
nt|hawe45:  OK|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@C=long suit. Just what South wants to hear |pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: '1NT semi forcing 2@D = 4+'|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6H even on a trump lead i think a long club can be set up form a 12th trick because hearts break 3/3|pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 @H one option,  4 nt quanti is another |pg||
nt|lestergold: but if they decide toplay 6n they are in serious trouble|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 4@h bcos, yr p might have @sKJx @hxx @dAJxx @cKQJx|pg||
nt|lestergold: with only 30 combined points and no suit fit greater than combined 7 cards, slam is intrinsincally an unsound proposition|pg||
nt|sybarra: so does drijver pass?|pg||
nt|lestergold: howeverc many matches even at top level are deided on lucky unsound decisions|pg||
nt|jeanhari: good save again|pg||
nt|sybarra: yep |pg||
pc|s7|nt|rodal f: Didn't Jan leave and a new person took here place Karen?|pg||
nt|kareno: WBF ratings would work I think.|pg||
nt|kareno: Oh, I don't know that.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  So we are also|pg||

nt|sybarra: this will work |pg||
nt|andyv:  this could easily go down 800|pg||
nt|jeanhari: must play this carefull|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes! A slam is only depending on the 5 aces. In vul and no interference a good hand without aces|pg||
pc|sA|nt|jcwla: N has a classic "death hand" - reasonably hopes for a couple of @C's but not to be - same 7-card fit but a level higher.  |pg||
nt|roswolf: a natural redouble would have produced an e/w heart contract so i suppose nothing really lost|pg||
nt|lestergold: these are youngish players not shy of strtetching their values|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mdgraham: East might pass this, with two aces|pg||
nt|yuval10: but i agree with his bid anyway, even if non vulnerable you should seek playing games|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|mdgraham: he will be disappointed|pg||

nt|vugraphzgq: N: grazie, nice hand|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Good pass from South. Misfit=stop bidding|pg||
pc|s4|nt|bridge_one: ossible take K@C out after the auction|pg||
nt|h_karluk: I expect 6@h now|pg||
nt|lestergold: no squeeze in 6N|pg||
nt|lestergold: better be 6@h the only slam with play|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sharkey: S will top out @CK I think|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 5/2 better than 4/3 with a little visualization of E looking into his hand|pg||
pc|s6|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|h4|nt|h_karluk: i wld swiftly pass to 2@h for those reasons : a) opener may have 11 with 6/4 junk in nonvul 2nd seat b) with 10 hcp when you see a limit rebid cannot go anywhere|pg||
nt|lestergold: well thyeve bid the pips off|pg||
nt|sybarra: wd ...now "we" have to make it |pg||
nt|lestergold: will south find the threateni9ng trump lead.|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: sry no clue for explanations don't want to disturb the players|pg||
nt|h_karluk: with 3-3 trumps break for any world master really easy|pg||
nt|lestergold: as we can see no trump lead and its easy to engineer the spade ruff for a twelth trick|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: according to coach Anton Maas 5NT means pick a slam|pg||
nt|lestergold: trump is not the noprmal textbook lead against a small slam|pg||
nt|sybarra: they landed right on the "picking" |pg||
pc|d7|nt|Vugraphzfb: No, this is still Jan - I left and no one took my place|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Off AKQ of trumps, yet|pg||
nt|sybarra: well....|pg||
nt|lestergold: well led now this is exciting bridge|pg||
nt|h_karluk: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/09Sanremo/graphics/DSC_5905-Senior-Gold.jpg|pg||
nt|lestergold: because having removed the easy play option Drijvwer has to either rely on 3/3 dims or establish a club|pg||
nt|h_karluk: with regards to Mr Anton Maas|pg||
nt|sybarra: he might be able to negotiated the clubs |pg||
nt|lestergold: but going for club establishment relies on 3/3 heart break or hand would fall apart so what will he do?|pg||
nt|sybarra: no actually not |pg||
nt|lestergold: he has chopices he has options what should he do foloks?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: lookd like -3 now|pg||
pc|h8|nt|dutcho: well if your opps have only 3 trumps usually they split 2-1|pg||

nt|kareno: So are cats - and I have three of those.|pg||
nt|harmon: STILLE!!!|pg||
nt|jeanhari: norths diamond pips too small, can even ruff both hearts|pg||
nt|andyv:  much easier to see the need for N to unblock the A of @c when seeing all 4 hands:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: agree Andy,   easy for us,  perhaps not so easy at the table |pg||
nt|jeanhari: cannot happen much but the players do not know that|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But N will knos a lot about souths distribution|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Sry will know with stiff @s and @d|pg||
nt|jeanhari: if north continues a heart he has a diamond to spare for ruffinf the fifth spade|pg||

nt|rhelle: which is what he is doing|pg||
nt|joest: i think east-west can come to four trump tricks|pg||
nt|joest: plus two sides|pg||
nt|Walddk2: As long as Khven does not crash partner's @HK, but why would he|pg||
nt|cicus: yes, simplest way is for E to  ruff  a @D|pg||
pc|d6|nt|joest: that lets EAST elope with the small trump, right|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
nt|rhelle: ah, the eloping ... shades of Kelsey & Ottlik|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, now it looks more like down to me|pg||
nt|rhelle: now duck a trump?|pg||
nt|joest: will probablly ruff a club to hand|pg||
nt|joest: and make a spade play|pg||
nt|rhelle: he may want to wait with that entry|pg||
nt|joest: a 7 imp gain here via 2@h down one will let Netherlands regain the lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I like Jack's line. Leave that trump in dummy for the time being|pg||

nt|Walddk2: But he will only score one more tump|pg||
nt|rhelle: now he has the count ... if @d were 3-3 East would have thrown it|pg||
nt|joest: if he thought @Ds 3-3 he should have cashed one a round ago :)|pg||
nt|rhelle: well yes :|pg||
nt|cicus: he should have done it anyway, ws only way to make|pg||
nt|joest: y|pg||
nt|joest: even though the spot cards suggested otherwise|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Funny hand, S and E both want to be shortened in trumps|pg||
nt|joest: however I think that might have led to down 2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: East will prevail|pg||
nt|rhelle: Yes south can't avoid being thrown in|pg||

nt|vugraphzgq: West is arguing "nice convention, @HA is no trick"|pg||
nt|jcwla: Nice underruff by Drijver at T10 -- give one, take three.|pg||
nt|yuval10: with AT9XXX ? not in my book :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: he went for dim break in effect|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: matter of styles |pg||
nt|ralfwil: mulit?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: I remember the late Joe Amsbury saying in one of his books that on hands like that you should aim to play the hand, come what may|pg||
nt|lestergold: as Isaid at the beginning that was an option but i cant see why he didnt ruff a club before testing the trumps than he would have hadt he mntries  to establish the club|pg||
nt|andyv:  I thought E might have played a @d to K and the J@s|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|sharkey: depends how you say it...|pg||
nt|harmon: we trust u completely Jan|pg||
nt|harmon: lol|pg||
nt|chessmaste: He was right|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this is some hand|pg||
nt|dutcho: polish 2@C 5@C and 4M or 6+@C|pg||
nt|stewball: 5@c a nice spot here|pg||
nt|roswolf: can north show his hand adequately|pg||
mb|1S|nt|roswolf: 3@H michaels like may have worked better|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i have not much sympathy to that 1st seat in vul vs nonvul 2@h|pg||
mb|2D!|an|!H|nt|panja: misfit here..|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @D =hts|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: yes - 5@C good sac|pg||
nt|sybarra: gets the hand off your chest,  just a wk 2 |pg||
nt|jeanhari: same result then|pg||
mb|2N|nt|sharkey: What's Silla to do?|pg||
nt|panja: trump lead will work well against a @h contract..|pg||
nt|harmon: for who??|pg||
nt|sharkey: Silla is Saelensminde's nick name |pg||
nt|xenya: yes, but somehow i doubt they'll get there|pg||
nt|stewball: dbl here might get them there|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2Nt 3 cards fit (but in balanced hand, so no sgl)|pg||
nt|andyv:  I think it's only 300 then|pg||
mb|p|nt|harmon: not for the defense|pg||
nt|jcwla: "3@D I do."|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not sure about 2NT with six solid diamonds|pg||
nt|hawe45:  And a singleton - no slam now, I suppose|pg||
nt|jcwla: The equivalent of the LOL bids of "4NT I do" and "4NT I don't" -- meaning I do or don't mean it as Blackwood.|pg||
nt|panja: 7@h here?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  even 8 - @H are 3-3|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: natural i.e. 21-23 bal, 3@C asks distribution|pg||
nt|yuval10: N will be able to introduce the @c now|pg||
mb|3C|nt|Vugraphzfb: Yes, when they sat down and I said that Saelinsminde wouldn't fit in the BBO name box, one of them suggested I just do Silla :)|pg||
nt|chessmaste: West might have done better to bid spades at some point - even 2@S was possible - then the double fit comes to light|pg||
nt|hawe45:  OK with that range, they bid the slam for sure|pg||
nt|panja: that is, can make 13 tricks in @H....no expectation of it being bid though|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 7@H cold on 3-3 hearts - don't think they will bid that, though :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: Well, they have steered their way into a 4-3 @H fit once this set.|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Sjoert is counting steps on his fingers|pg||
nt|stewball: S hand will improve considerably|pg||
nt|dinos1: 4@c now?|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: this 2@H bid always has a certain 'I have @S too' message, else 2@H preempt would have been on|pg||
nt|stewball: every thing he has is working hard|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: N will probably compete here|pg||
nt|sharkey: this shud make|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4@D instead 4@h is correct, bec give at the partner the elements to know what make after a 4@S by S|pg||
nt|jeanhari: 3@C would be best place here|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: Pass looks to me a bit weird....he knows EW has 8 cards fit in @s and he's non vulnerable|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: sry|pg||
nt|h_karluk: would you pick 3@c yuval?|pg||
nt|yuval10: ok....that's a bit better :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: and no DBL even, on @D lead it appears to be -2-vul|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i meant as S|pg||
nt|yuval10: quite tough.... if P has 2 @s's it's better to defend maybe|pg||
nt|stewball: ugh|pg||
nt|xenya: 4@C on Qxxxx ?|pg||
nt|stewball: now S has easy 5@c imo|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|sharkey: Geir had a very difficult lead I think|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Boye hadn't turned the diamond ten upside down and laughingly did so, implying he had been holding Helge up, but not|pg||
nt|dinos1: X was t/o - short @h|pg||
nt|jeanhari: lucky it did not promise extra's :)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and much better on W:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Louk explains he must have 4441 as he normally accepts the transfer|pg||
nt|jeanhari: ok, nice|pg||
nt|jeanhari: but playing this wont be fun|pg||
pc|s2|nt|vugraphzgq: sry|pg||
nt|bridge_one: stand leads (any use small from XX)|pg||
pc|s6|nt|hawe45:  On a @D-lead, 3 NT might make easily here|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: 2@H: usually without stopper in @D|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Perhaps Hans would care to suggest a route to 3NT?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No route - but that happens often...|pg||
nt|xenya: i'm about to change my verdict -- seems they are on their way to 5@C (at least?)|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|panja: when in doubt, lead a trump!|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: 3@D no 4M, 4+ @D|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: 3@H asks @D|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: 3@S = 4 (?)|pg||
nt|yuval10: even with the advertised 8 @c's support|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mdgraham: mind you, this is a bit of a perfect fit - reaching 6@D is by no means simple|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: he must have miscounted his fingers before bidding 3@S :-))|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ok ..let's study the hand. say 4/4 minors, they start with @d, so opener in 4th seat vs vul has obv 5@c/4@d - my vote is : ok to S's X, no to pass - i wld bid 3@c over 2@s in ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: competition|pg||
nt|yuval10: 8@c fir that is|pg||
nt|yuval10: *fit|pg||
pc|sA|nt|jcwla: asks @D honors, not cards :)|pg||
pc|s7|nt|mdgraham: although on a low diamond to the ten and jack, North plays clubs...West gets in and plays @D8 through.....East can switch to a heart for another diamond|pg||
nt|chessmaste: in 3@C declarer has no problems|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: he thinks he has ...|pg||
nt|stewball: more ugh|pg||
nt|stewball: serious under evaluation by S i think|pg||

pc|d2|pc|d5|nt|stewball: can N have less?|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d7|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|bridge_one: @D 3/2 and K@H in finesse - so np for East|pg||
pc|d8|nt|sybarra: I would probably bid 3....  but would definitely bid with W hand |pg||
pc|dT|nt|lestergold: West had enough bot to fear game by opps and not enuf to make game opposite an average weak 2|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d9|nt|dinos1: bad 3@h bid - if doubt on 5@c - bid 4@c|pg||

nt|rnmalik: 2NT-3@H pass|pg||

nt|xenya: vulnerable|pg||
nt|joest: I think everyone would intervene over a strong club with THIS hand -- to be fair|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe Dirk should change his explanation over 1NT as "No place to play" :)|pg||

pc|c5|nt|joest: hmm|pg||
nt|joest: what chance that will happen?|pg||
nt|rhelle: somewhere between slim and none|pg||
nt|joest: but if lho had the ten ofhearts third you might score a heart trick on power|pg||
nt|xenya: all of them are losers so doesnt really matter it seems|pg||
nt|rhelle: perhaps - you sure he wouldn't be trump short before that @h is established?|pg||
nt|rhelle: I like this better - it forces defenders to play trumps|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|hawe45:  This 3 NT must be played by North|pg||
nt|xenya: could N have 2 hearts -- something like AQxx  xx  xxx Axxx?|pg||
nt|roswolf: the other room is very slow|pg||
nt|andyv:  perhaps E should not have been so willing to play at the 2 level without support from pd (a negative double may have worked better)|pg||
mb|2D!|an|18-19 bal|nt|bridge_one: Dbl means 4+@S (without this gadget the bid would be 1 or 2@S depending on agreements)|pg||

mb|d|nt|vugraphzgq: here you are Hans|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Gromow got the message|pg||
nt|dinos1: that's why better bid 4@c|pg||
nt|andyv:  redbl now would make it interesting|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is multi with the strong hand  |pg||
mb|4D|nt|sharkey: 2@C?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@C is forcing probably +way|pg||
nt|bridge_one: like a mixed raise in @H like here|pg||
nt|roswolf: another potentially murky auction|pg||
nt|sharkey: ok.....?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@h would be weaker|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: nice X by W|pg||
nt|dinos1: pass is impossible|pg||
nt|h_karluk: in vul W expected 10 hcp there|pg||
nt|jeanhari: not the right  momeny for 4@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: I think it is Italian style ?|pg||
nt|sybarra: is it a transfer?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|bjacobs: North stays away from Michaels - not sure why|pg||
nt|yuval10: they'll find the @s fit now, but N will probably compete to 3m|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i guess that overcall worths to discuss in an experts panel on any bridge magazine|pg||
nt|dinos1: 6@c here|pg||
nt|stewball: cautious pass|pg||
nt|xenya: need an undo here|pg||
nt|dutcho: dont think he passed that|pg||
nt|dinos1: in 6@s - @c ruff|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: most any lead will sell a trick here..|pg||
nt|panja: not a @S though|pg||
nt|chessmaste: There are 3 losers in 5@D, so they have to reach 3NT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: difficult now |pg||
nt|chessmaste: Very|pg||
nt|mdgraham: admirably direct|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: and Dubinin too :-)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  ThatÂ´s what happens, when you bid 1 @H with this West-hand|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Safety?|pg||
nt|roswolf: love the explanation|pg||
nt|sharkey: sry - missed 1@H oevrcall|pg||
nt|roswolf: try for what - suicide!?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfb: Helness: "nice" Silla: "nice" - different intonations, sorry I can't do them|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Forcing.,..?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But still no 9 tricks|pg||
nt|mdgraham: @H10 lead would be an easy set (East must get in with @CK) but a low heart is reasonable  |pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: all results on http://www.nbbportal.nl/7024/clubcompetitie_2.html|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzgq: sry I was disturbed|pg||
nt|xenya: np Marc|pg||

nt|sybarra: likely club lead |pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: sry can't get that information|pg||
pc|d4|nt|yuval10: if it's 4+ m then perhaps he'll avoid it..but it's very likely for P to have 5-5 when he's red|pg||
nt|rnmalik: that is true|pg||
nt|lestergold: this is not a cake walk|pg||
nt|sybarra: oops |pg||
nt|jeanhari: north must be thinking otherwise|pg||
pc|dT|nt|sharkey: Are they convering in English at the table Jan?|pg||
nt|sharkey: conversing*|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Mostly in Norwegian, but that was English - don't know if it's the same word|pg||
nt|hawe45:  With a decent @H-suit in West, all @H-lead works|pg||
nt|dutcho: neither do I actually|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and obviousl that would be a two parter question : a) would you overcall with 2@h b) what would be your bid over NT opener's X|pg||
nt|dinos1: 5@h wd be exclusion blkw?|pg||
nt|xenya: they won't reach a @S contract if they don't agree the suit|pg||
nt|stewball: not sure how redbl helps pard here|pg||
pc|d5|nt|Vugraphzfb: They also call the cards in Norwegian, so I have to watch the dummy|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Is 4@s makeable? looks rather good as the cards lie|pg||
nt|sybarra: can you deal with the 5/0?|pg||
nt|jeanhari: think it will make indeed|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Yes! 2@c 4@h 2@d and W has to play @s|pg||
nt|jeanhari: Khiuppenen looking for a lie of the cards that can get him 10 tricks|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and no @d favour is needed|pg||
nt|andyv:  lead rather dangerous|pg||
nt|jeanhari: wiil need a spade trick, , maybe play them early|pg||
nt|andyv:  W didn't dbl 4@d, so @c lead appears to be more normal|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South knows that North is limited by the non-strong 1@C opening  |pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: short break as the late lunch arrived and players make their choice from the rolls|pg||
nt|mdgraham: a bit unlucky, really. @HAKQ wasted|pg||
nt|h_karluk: just make a good guess in @s|pg||
nt|lestergold: declarer can  easily lose 2 dim tricks here as the odds are a first round finesse of the 9|pg||
nt|lestergold: meanwhile brink has to find a switch|pg||
pc|c8|nt|dutcho: this will be interesting|pg||
nt|bjacobs: In a way, the lower 2@H bid is more dangerous than the higher 2@S bid|pg||
nt|lestergold: not the best as it happens|pg||
nt|h_karluk: I bet Vadim smiles right now|pg||
nt|lestergold: j@h was the only 'safe' card to play |pg||
nt|andyv:  or less risky anyway|pg||
pc|c5|nt|sharkey: Dont have "nice" in Norwegian - or anything close...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: There is no word for nice in Norwegian|pg||
nt|Walddk4: :)|pg||
nt|hlortz: the truth comes out!|pg||
nt|panja: N playing for doubleton @CH with E|pg||
nt|jcwla: 9 more to Russia on 4 - where EW here played 3@H-2, S in the OR played 2@H-2.|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: all pairs rotate on the different teams for the selector wants to see how the different combinations score|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: So every round 'Nederland 1' plays against 'Rusland 1' but the teams may or may not contain the same players|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: W still thinking|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This layout was not a whole lot away from a re-opening double by West, passed by East, for a large number|pg||
nt|bridge_one: any pair use 2@S immediatly with North cards (limit 6 good cards) to take the advantage to know fast the strong of the hands in the line and leave space at opps to bid|pg||
nt|sharkey: thus 2@S slow way probably more constructive|pg||
nt|roswolf: well i do but then i am strange!:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: I thought E would lead a club |pg||
pc|cA|nt|sharkey: yes there is Roland - may be not in Danish|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|chessmaste: It looks odd, but given that South was a pased hand should North prefer 2NT to 3@D?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: egg and bacon for me please |pg||
nt|xenya: perhaps N is going to take command?|pg||
nt|dinos1: hard to get much from S who bid spades w/o AK|pg||
nt|jeanhari: give west Qx of spades and 4 hearts and maybe this will make|pg||
pc|dA|nt|dutcho: both x and 3@C are possible rebids with west|pg||
pc|d6|nt|stewball: hm|pg||
nt|xenya: sounds mysterious  |pg||
pc|s3|pc|d2|pg||
nt|dburn:  well, North didnt have to bid on - he might conclude that South would not have @cA or @cK since he could have bid 3NT if so|pg||
pc|d8|nt|rodal f: Those Danich:)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: on @H void is it not difficult|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: 'spade finesse, 1 or 2 down'|pg||
nt|dinos1: 5N - ask @cA or "choose slam"?|pg||
nt|xenya: not to S though|pg||
pc|d9|nt|hlortz: tho trusting a Dane's comment about Norwegians.. doubtful|pg||
nt|panja: the @D duck encouraged a losing @C finesse, it seems..|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: and similar Nederland 2 vs Rusland 2|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Now an endplay against West in the red suits|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - but for 1 down|pg||
nt|xenya: well done |pg||
nt|stewball: invitation to disaster unless its clear|pg||
nt|stewball: and perhaps it was to S|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: 5NT: "bid 7 with good club"|pg||
nt|dinos1: thk 5N was grand slam force|pg||
nt|dutcho: well they got to the top spot|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: N has shown strong with @C, 1st rnd ctrl @H, S showed @D ctrl and 5@D with 4@S|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|yuval10: N would've done better to unblock the @d's|pg||
pc|cT|nt|sharkey: Danes & Norwegian usually get along - we both have problems with the Swedes sometimes :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: what is te rush  here to ruff the heart?|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|lestergold: left himself badly placed|pg||
nt|lestergold: what now?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @sA93 and Q1062 good enough, probably would play for @c A and @c exit|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Q@D has made him think to find KT@D with E|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: ignore the clubs, W played J at 1st opportunity|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: so now dummy won with @C9|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: and @C is still there|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: @CQ that is|pg||
pc|c9|nt|jeanhari: ok, wont matter much :)|pg||
pc|h7|nt|roswolf: south caught napping there|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c6|pg||
nt|yuval10: so his P can play @s|pg||
nt|h_karluk: then it all depends your @s guess as i said b4|pg||
nt|ralfwil: W can now see max 1@s on E so @sA and....|pg||
pc|h8|nt|bjacobs: Declarer will need to fall back on the club finesse|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Although I suppose he could also play for a club ruff, so cancel the above comment|pg||
nt|dutcho: he could just give a club right bill?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Oh, give up a club?  ... So declarer can do practically anything he likes, and make it?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: still overruff ad 3 rounds clubs good defense|pg||
nt|sharkey: @H now|pg||
nt|sharkey: guess doesnt matter|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Q@D seam better|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|nt|panja: would have made with @D 33|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h9|pc|hK|nt|bridge_one: but it is the same|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Last board of the match and our broadcast from the Netherlands. Many thanks to Dirk Clauwens, our terrific operator at the Onstein Catsle. Great job all weekend!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Also thanks to our excellent commentators, Rob Helle, Jack Oest, Vladimir Ivanov, and Gábor Szöts|pg||
nt|cicus: I think bd 12 (not yet scored) is going to decide in favour of Russia|pg||
nt|joest: thx to you too roland|pg||
nt|xenya: good save in other room|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Finally, our gratitude to the NBB (Marc van Beijsterveldt) and the sponsor, Hans Melchers, for ensuring that this quality match was brought to BBO. Much appreciated by bridge fans ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: all over the world|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: We were mising board 8|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, and here it is|pg||
nt|xenya: same thing might happen here though|pg||

mb|2D|an|weak major|mb|2S|mb|3H|an|I think he has !Hs|nt|joest: 2@d = multi most likely.  A weak two in either major|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I doubt that they will take the save|pg||
nt|joest: I agree Roland. the auction will time out differently|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Was different in the other room where West passed initially|pg||
nt|xenya: sorry. W opened -- that will make a difference i think|pg||
nt|rhelle: Yes, West won't bid anymore after having set out his stall|pg||
nt|joest: and East is most definitely not in save mode|pg||
nt|xenya: but E might?|pg||
nt|rhelle: and East is too balanced with too much defence|pg||
nt|joest: if my partner saved in 5@h I would set him up with a psychiatrist :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: Muller is missing a bidding card again he starts to order them|pg||
nt|xenya: true|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sT|nt|joest: so Netherlands would appear to grab victory here on this last board|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Play finished in the closed room but no score entered on board 12|pg||
nt|rhelle: this will be quick|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Perhaps one of our spectators was there to see?|pg||
nt|cicus: he hides one before each board to leave himself more time to think|pg||

pc|sK|pc|sJ|pc|s3|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: discussion of the hand, but it's in Norwegian so I can't tell you anything, sorry|pg||
nt|dburn:  still, I suppose South might have had @dA, in which case 5@d might not be a lot worse than the spade finesse|pg||
nt|dutcho: I silent 2@S for NS?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: pretty end game |pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: likely to be a good score for EW, the competitive hands are the most important in such a level!|pg||
nt|ralfwil: interesting to see if they play and make 4@s in OR|pg||
mb|1S|nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
mb|d|nt|chessmaste: It was awkward to be sure|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 1NT would have been interesting and EW got into makeable contract|pg||
nt|dutcho: the 2@c makes life hard for NS|pg||
nt|dinos1: as 4@c|pg||
nt|bridge_one: East can bid 1Nt (bec used for 4M5m)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: can't (sry)|pg||
nt|sharkey: The Dutch didnt get to slam on Bd 3 so Russia have opened a 19-0 lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: would it have made without defence solving the dim layout problem|pg||
mb|4S|nt|rodal f: Hehehe Go on Roland and we start for full speed.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This hand demonstrates just how right it is to open 1NT as North|pg||
nt|h_karluk: quite suitable shape for 2@d/2@h F****ry convention with N's collection|pg||
nt|andyv:  I still like 2@dxx :)|pg||
mb|5H|nt|bjacobs: 1NT makes; 2@S doesn't|pg||
nt|dutcho: I was wrong again:)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Maybe a heart lead to 1NT would prove me wrong as well|pg||
nt|dinos1: pushed them to overbid|pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 5 other table in 3 nt making +2|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 25/15 4@h worths to try|pg||
mb|d|nt|dutcho: well good look by Gert-Jan Paulissen|pg||
nt|dutcho: yes and both north and south have their bid|pg||
nt|bridge_one: so 1Maj can be 4 cards if the hand is good (14+)|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would have doubled with the east hand in the circumstances|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: NS hold the balance of strength, however, since S has almost all, EW will come to more tricks than NS|pg||
nt|sharkey: agree |pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Much of the Norwegian language originates from Danish - in addition we have dialect Norwegian, "nynorsk"|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Untraditional 12-14 NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: sry no alert on 1NT, just 15-17 :-)|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: that's what their cc says|pg||
nt|yuval10: 4@s now|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with passed hand in my partner the bid of 1@h (giveng the lead) isn't bad|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Bas got the answer he wanted 2nd from 4 small|pg||
nt|h_karluk: slow approach good here|pg||
mb|p|nt|chessmaste: That looks to be a good lead|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Are you surprised at that lead?  |pg||
nt|dutcho: this lead also attacks the only direct entry to dummy|pg||
nt|sybarra: N may be a bid disappointed with where the a of @H is |pg||
nt|sybarra: but down one is good bridge right?|pg||
nt|andyv:  and more disappointed that this will only be down 1|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: as far as I know EW have no weak 2@H available|pg||
pc|dA|nt|hawe45:  Long day here - for East|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not usually recommended, leading from jack to four |pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: 4th best, 2nd from xxxx|pg||
nt|jcwla: This looks like 5-4 inv'l and Brink passes with a prime submin.|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Sjoert confirms 15-17 with a smile|pg||
nt|hawe45:  We still think, that West has promised 15-17?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  OK - then he must refuse the invit|pg||
nt|dinos1: 5@d now?|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mdgraham: then that is some upgrade|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Bachar Abouchanab|pg||
nt|dinos1: yes|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Yes! as NS make 4@s but not 5@s|pg||
pc|d7|nt|yuval10: S knows he has no ruffing value in @h contract but his partner has plenty in @s contract|pg||
nt|sybarra: this should be -1 |pg||
nt|h_karluk: depends West's defense|pg||
nt|lestergold: well ths is an example mof why i personally do not tend to respond with han ds like North's|pg||
nt|lestergold: a k an two Js is not in my view an upgradeable 5 count|pg||
nt|rnmalik: now a chance , play AK@H and @S and pitch one @D, would that work|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @sA and @c Q would be a nice move to test West's nerves|pg||
nt|lestergold: probably|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: bathroom|pg||
nt|lestergold: can draw twoo rounds of trumps lay spades get rid of dim loser but then west is in draws third trumps and declare is short of trick|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i guess declarer has no luxury to test trumps right now|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|dutcho: well I would just lead my longest suit @D|pg||
pc|dK|nt|doctorone: Good morning all :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: well that is true|pg||
nt|sybarra: this could well be a push btw|pg||
pc|d5|nt|yuval10: a nice lead by W to begin with|pg||
pc|d3|nt|sharkey: Helness opened light to get @D lead - may actually help Boye|pg||
nt|panja: S can get two possible entrie to Dummy to play @H, @SJ and @CQ..|pg||
nt|panja: W can deny him the @SJ entry by ducking @SQ..|pg||
nt|dutcho: hi Bachar|pg||
nt|yuval10: but with the favourable place of the A@c it looks likely that declarer will make|pg||
nt|h_karluk: west picked the way to ruff with his master trump|pg||
nt|xenya: just 1 down?|pg||
nt|dinos1: yeah|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|andyv:  interesting that NS could gain imps only if they stopped below game:)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|chessmaste: They did not look for a major fit, so North preferred a heart to a diamond|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I would have played bak a @H in trick 2|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Seeing West unblock the @H Queen|pg||
nt|dburn:  not clear why South preferred a spade to a heart, though|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true |pg||
nt|hawe45:  Kill dummy|pg||
nt|sharkey: i see only 6 tricks here...|pg||
pc|s9|nt|bjacobs: Against 1NT passed out, it's quite a good idea to lead your stronger major, as a principle|pg||
nt|lestergold: hoping that Drijver doesnt cash the second diamond|pg||
nt|lestergold: declarfer is hoping for some kind of misdefence|pg||
nt|h_karluk: East read what declarer tries to do, so @s 9 or @hx still good - even @cJ reasonable|pg||
nt|lestergold: the old play of playing the suit you dont want the opps to play|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sJ|pg||

nt|h_karluk: did i miscount?|pg||

mb|2S|nt|jcwla: Kaplan/Rubens evaluated it to 13.5: http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=J75+AK+98+AT7653|pg||
nt|h_karluk: east doesn't have 12?|pg||
nt|yuval10: E didn't open his hand which is quite remarkable nowadays :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Instead of @S Ace had he played small @C he would have made it|pg||
nt|roswolf: dont like 3@D|pg||
nt|h_karluk: do you agree with 1@s  overcall?|pg||
mb|2N|an|good bad|nt|chessmaste: 3NT making looks good - in the other room South led the king of diamonds!|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Just what East wanted, the bidding at 4@C by the time it got back to him|pg||
nt|chessmaste: At least he won't go down in 3NT|pg||
mb|4S|nt|yuval10: 3@h - 4@h|pg||
nt|sybarra: good/bad is just as its name implies|pg||
nt|jeanhari: south thinking?|pg||
nt|sybarra: and can start the run out for minor or 3 @H |pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: yep, he didn't alert 2NT|pg||
nt|sybarra: or cause S to now think?|pg||
mb|p|nt|doctorone: yes... I think for NT to be playable, you hope for some @s support anyhow|pg||
nt|dutcho: ReHi all, I lost connection|pg||
nt|h_karluk: true Rasid|pg||
mb|p|nt|doctorone: welc back :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This hand is going to play like a foot|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn:  he wasn't all that likely to go down in 3NT, but he may well go down in this|pg||
nt|bridge_one: me too don't like because leave too space and 5 cards arn't sufficient|pg||
nt|roswolf: north was pragmatic|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: I think S thought because of dbl pd could be weak with @D|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes providing that is partnership style which i am sure it is|pg||
nt|jeanhari: must remember the good-bad 2NT now|pg||
pc|hK|nt|hawe45:  Only 3 loosers - but will that make 10 winners? I doubt it|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: 'do I need to have 10 cards in M or is 9 OK?'|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Blood round the corner|pg||
nt|panja: N has bid once too many times perhaps|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Was OK, if some of their bids had been PASS|pg||
nt|xenya: time for coffee|pg||
nt|dinos1: only  @d lead cd beat|pg||
nt|dinos1: rather impossible|pg||
pc|h2|nt|dutcho: very nice defense by EW on board 8.|pg||
nt|dutcho: Jansma picked the wrong major to bid|pg||
nt|yuval10: E figure out that 9 tricks are easier than 10.... a bit dangerous in this hand but might succeed|pg||
pc|h3|nt|bridge_one: i don't understand why not 2@d (after the dbl) - may be they use a convention about 2@D in this sequence|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|mdgraham: double by North surely shows spades - reckon 3@S by South here, and then over to West|pg||
nt|yuval10: 4@h would've gone down with @c lead so this might create a swing too|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Is there any chance for @S lead|pg||
nt|yuval10: no....but red suit lead will make it interesting|pg||
nt|yuval10: @c lead will give 9th trick right away|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @S would snatch 5 right away:)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i would pass at 2nd seat vul vs nonvul|pg||
nt|andyv:  this should be one of the easier contracts for declarer in this set|pg||
pc|d7|nt|vugraphzgq: a rather quick pass|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but West can't double with his hand, surely, even after the redouble from East |pg||
nt|lestergold: always easier to vome in at 1 level with a poor hand than 2 level with quite a good hand|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d3|nt|hlortz: 5@C would be in jeopardy if K@H in other hand|pg||
nt|rodal f: A new flatty by the nice @D layout? Or slamtry by 5@C as end?|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|rnmalik: good lead let the declarer work for the 9th|pg||
nt|yuval10: of course S can discard over 6@h's 4@c's and one @d and still beat the contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: GJP now studying opp's carding|pg||
nt|yuval10: but it's not so easy as it looks like|pg||
nt|rnmalik: at times it becomes hard for the defender to analyise that a contract has been bid without @S stopper|pg||
nt|yuval10: N should signal @s to his P in any way he can, mostly by the order of the @h's he'll play|pg||
nt|h_karluk: courageous lead|pg||
pc|s7|nt|jcwla: Russia did bid and make 6@D on 6 so 12 more, up 31-9.|pg||
nt|panja: I have to logoff now, thx all, bye|pg||
nt|jcwla: Thx Panja|pg||

pc|s4|nt|Vugraphzfb: Helness explaining what Helgemo has shown to Silla, but in Norwegian - I think that 3@c promised clubs and was forcing to game, but that's just from the body language|pg||
nt|sharkey: As Henry mentioned they have "rightsided" the contract so shudnt be anything to the play|pg||
nt|panja: could W have rebid 3@H on 3@D to keep alive chances of playing in 3NT? or should E have rebid 3N instead of 3@D?|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s9|pg||
nt|hawe45:  22 IMPÂ´s board 5 - when did we see that score...?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 6@Dx+1 at one table, 6@Sx+1 at the other|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Russia made a doubled slam +1 in both rooms|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Both doubling pairs lost an overtrick also|pg||
nt|mdgraham: cost an imp, that|pg||
nt|rnmalik: That was some hand to think of it|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Nice score in a 10-board-match|pg||
nt|rnmalik: This hand would further add some imps to NS |pg||
nt|dinos1: will shift to @s playing S for @sQ10x?|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rhelle: true - but in their system, over a major that is almost impossible|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: partner is not going to be carried away|pg||
nt|rhelle: as everything has a specialised meaning|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h5|nt|cicus: even 1NT?|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h9|pg||
nt|rhelle: i.e. over 1@h, 1@s = relay, 1NT shows @s, 2@c = any invite, etc|pg||
nt|cicus: that puts it in different light|pg||
nt|rhelle: it's easier over 1@d, as 1@h and 1@s are 6-12 and F1R - offes much more scope for messing around|pg||

nt|h_karluk: a real gem|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, nice defence resulting in an overtrick or 2|pg||

nt|dutcho: 1@H=spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: don't think that NS will play more than a game here|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the advantage to use 3@D is preemptive vs East (leave the level two )|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1@H xfert (of course)|pg||
nt|sybarra: passing with S?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|Vugraphzfb: Comment by Silla and laughter - I was thinking I wouldn't want to be playing rubber bridge against Helness this set, so maybae that's what he said|pg||
nt|bridge_one: to give @h would bid Dbl|pg||
nt|sybarra: hate to do that |pg||
mb|p|nt|harmon: can he find sp lead??|pg||
nt|panja: B58, N finessed out of bidding|pg||
nt|yuval10: if they will it will surely be interesting|pg||
nt|h_karluk: cash @h A then play towards @d K and claim 12 tricks - we see, how about declarer :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: with 11 cards chances are for play of @HAce and @D are friendly and a 6|pg||
nt|xenya: what's 1@D? -- weak hand or hearts? |pg||
nt|xenya: hearts|pg||
nt|dinos1: @h|pg||
mb|2H|nt|rnmalik: 4@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: sry 1@D is weak but could be nat and strong too|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Do they response 1@S with hearts?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@c like a drury|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: N could as well have 5 @H...as the present hand..|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Helness asking Silla something, I think about spot card leads|pg||
nt|mdgraham: suspect 1@S=transfer to 1NT|pg||
nt|andyv:  in OR, S did not compete over 1@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Louk checking about S's NT ranges|pg||
mb|d|nt|mdgraham: ...or not....|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: it looks it is but Sjoert choose to pass (Bas saying 1@S could be 2@S)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: oh thanks for double|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: according to dummy GJP 1@D is lots of hands, mostly no other bid available (so certainly no @H)|pg||
mb|p|nt|dutcho: yes but 1@H with 4-4 major|pg||
nt|yuval10: the X by W "convince" N not to think about slam|pg||
nt|xenya: N must have thought that a double at any point would be too dangerous -- i tend to agree |pg||
nt|andyv:  500 if left in|pg||
mb|2S|nt|sybarra: I dont think E will sit (and he did not) |pg||
mb|p|nt|dutcho: so partner could bid 1@S showing 4@H|pg||
nt|doctorone: Then, S may well have found the @h lead|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that gives a chance to get 12 tricks|pg||
nt|roswolf: well a high risk contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: interesting 3Nt finding the stop with Qx Jxx in @c - but K@D out is a bad notice (:|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: perfect lead - keeping the communication with partner|pg||
pc|h7|nt|xenya: any bid i mean|pg||
nt|h_karluk: buckle up, let's keep body and soul together :) transportation problems for declarer|pg||
nt|rnmalik: yes small @S multiplies them|pg||
pc|h5|nt|h_karluk: hard to visualize for any mortal defender|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|dutcho: well KQT98 seems like a normal suit to lead from|pg||
nt|doctorone: true :)|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|roswolf: i am not sure there is any clue to get the diamonds right|pg||
pc|cK|nt|sharkey: Compared to the fireworks we had at the end of 3rd quarter this match definitely has quieted down|pg||
pc|c7|nt|panja: but...if one consider the chance..for N to have 5 @H...EW each would have to have 22..whereas for 5@S..it could be 3-2..just A to five would do...I guess @S has a little better % ...|pg||
nt|panja: chance of success in IMPs|pg||
nt|harmon: oyyyyyyyy|pg||
nt|bridge_one: need play the finesse|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cA|pg||
nt|yuval10: is everybody play here 4@c as shortness? for me 2@s ( beginning of short trail bid ) following by 4@c over P's relay bid of 2NT will show void|pg||
pc|hA|nt|dutcho: North found the switch so I guess 7 tricks if my count is correct|pg||
nt|h_karluk: now home sweet home, i bet West would question himself for not playing @d Q|pg||
pc|h9|nt|h_karluk: @d A marked|pg||
pc|h8|nt|dinos1: 8 top tricks for def|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the only reason to don't play the finesse is to have see the opps cards :)|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this kind of system (two-way club, 1@D negative, etc) is played by quite a few pairs in England|pg||

mb|p|nt|joest: East did well to double.   Some might pass knowing they were facing a passed hand|pg||
nt|joest: In most partnerships West's pass tends to 'show something'|pg||
nt|cicus: they were facing 2 passed hands :)|pg||
nt|joest: so that his 2@s bid now would not be a bust|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: After pass pass by de Wij = 4333 Rdbl = 4432 bid = 5|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dQ|pc|d2|pc|d3|pc|dK|pg||
nt|joest: South might have taken a swing at 3NT.  They are probably not making overtricks and if they are down 2, double shows a big profit|pg||
nt|rhelle: South has seen North's 3rd hand openings before|pg||
nt|joest: but of 1NT?|pg||
nt|cicus: although the lead cost a trick it also helped to establish N's suit to which he has tehe required 2 entries|pg||

nt|yuval10: then 4@c is a suit, 5-5 at least, slamish|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true but 4@C-4@H by P and 5@C again void|pg||
nt|dutcho: yes north needed to play ace on diamonds when he was in for -3|pg||
nt|bridge_one: a game at 50% is a good game|pg||
nt|roswolf: 6@D looks a cool contract|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and i am surprised why declarer not unblocked @h A after @c hook|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 140? not 110|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: I thought he had 9 but surely claimed for 8 tricks|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rodal f: Some have a rule by leads WHEN majors have not been bidded. Play ure shorstest. |pg||
nt|panja: 12 tricks in @S for NS, it seems here..but only 11 in @D..|pg||
nt|doctorone: agree, Bill. Requires work though, and these guys are certainly up to it :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: but then you're in the 5-level...might be crucial if P has waisted points in @c|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think Birman played so - long years ago in Antalya, Belladonna was also there|pg||
mb|1D|nt|xenya: anyway looks like a good score for Russia -- 3N can't be made on careful defence|pg||
mb|d|nt|rodal f: Have never tested that out.|pg||
nt|dutcho: it has his origin from the orange club which was designed to serve the entire dutch team. Nowadays Only Jansma and Paulissen play somethigng simular|pg||
nt|bridge_one: here the stregth of a 6430 !|pg||
nt|h_karluk: seems there penultimate board|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: or not perhaps..11 in @S too|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Helness asking Brogeland how many somethings he had last hand - maybe spades|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I was going to comment: "what contract should North be thinking of when he picks up his hand?"|pg||
nt|dutcho: I like his choice of opening bid|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Yes P may not have KQJ of @S very essential for the contract|pg||
nt|yuval10: i'm quite assure Birman play 4@c here as a suit, as he was the one who teached m to play like that anyway :P|pg||
nt|h_karluk: mutiny there? :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: but off to the next hand and awkward bidding prob. W has now|pg||
nt|bridge_one: if bid 2@h probably 3Nt bu North ....|pg||
nt|bridge_one: GREAT !|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4@S giving void - no strong in points but strong in distribution is excellent choise|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but can be alsop exclusion blakw|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i prefere to use 4@S like splinter|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: no questions/answers yet, let's see what north bids|pg||
mb|2S|nt|bjacobs: My answer was: "he should be thinking of 3NT"|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: expl. by S "to play"|pg||
nt|doctorone: I was thinking about N's choice here, and I like it :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And then he goes and bids it!|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Singleton kings are like a red rag to a bull.  You have visions of a low card being led from the ace, and you winning your king|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: N expl 1st and 2nd shows solid suit without outside stopper but 3rd is different|pg||
nt|xenya: not that any given defence is careful enough|pg||
nt|h_karluk: this is a "high" reverse example|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|roswolf: a void splinter is likely|pg||
nt|h_karluk: as once Michael Lawrence introduced to modern bridge|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: yes, i bet for splinter|pg||
nt|roswolf: RKCB hardly would help i think|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: now Sjoert wants explanation (before he decides to double or not?)|pg||
mb|3N|nt|roswolf: with the trump suit being diamonds less room to investigate|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the reason bec i think 4@s splinter is that South can't use exclusion blkw with minimum open|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Your chance to play at 't Onstein yourself:|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Patton tournament on Whitsun. More info on www.onstein.info|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: adios to 9 cards @h fit|pg||
nt|yuval10: if X wasn't for penalty, then perhaps X and 3@h over 3@d....but i suspect they might play X here as penalty|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: note the 1Nt rebid, 2@C will be fourth suit, not enough @H for 2@H...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: laughing conversation on the NE side of the screen - no idea about what|pg||
nt|sharkey: 4@S everybody's choice?|pg||
nt|hlortz: 3 would do for me|pg||
nt|panja: no..4@D perhaps for me|pg||
nt|harmon: I wouldve bid 2s then 3s earlier|pg||
mb|p|pc|dQ|nt|sharkey: Helness, Silla and Helgemo play on the same team in the Norwegian 1. division|pg||
nt|panja: partner can decide whether to raise, bid 4@S or even Pass..?|pg||
nt|dinos1: -1|pg||
nt|roswolf: north takes control|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: 4@S void, 4NT blackwood, 5@C 1|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Sjoert asks for explanation and concludes 'nothing has happened'|pg||
nt|ralfwil: many 3nt on 23 and rather balanced hands|pg||
pc|d2|nt|panja: to make 12 tricks..N must cash @DAK and ruff third @D...|pg||
nt|hlortz: he's more concerned with making sure of 10 :(|pg||
pc|d6|nt|bridge_one: but it is also true that 3@S was splinter the same (i use 3@s also with sgl and a strong open, instead 4@S weak points but void)|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|bridge_one: well, ty Marc|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|harmon: thats wrong anyway|pg||
nt|xenya: not yet|pg||
nt|dinos1: if return @sJ - duck|pg||
nt|dinos1: then only @d shift beats|pg||
nt|bridge_one: March told 4@S splinter with void in not strong hand|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Marc is the operator, so know the explain at the table|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|hlortz: but everything breaks so all will be well|pg||
nt|dinos1: duck|pg||
nt|andyv:  I wonder if 1N by E would have meant something different|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d8|nt|panja: he is...so he will likely ruff second @D|pg||
nt|rnmalik: It was tough for E to DBL 1@S without @C and there he is playing a @C contract|pg||
pc|d7|nt|dinos1: uc? hard to sfift to @d's w/o @d signal|pg||
nt|xenya: W needs to duck this too|pg||
nt|dinos1: no matter|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dJ|nt|dutcho: well against gambling people sometimes just lead an ace|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a good point|pg||
pc|c6|nt|bridge_one: the exclusion blw is usefull, but can't be used jumping 3 level of bid ....|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|dinos1: @hK - @s - @h fin|pg||
pc|s4|nt|panja: and a @D ruff will not hold decl to 11|pg||
nt|panja: now..|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Helness had the @d Q out but put it back and put hands behind head and thinking|pg||
nt|panja: he has @D count..and knows N should be 65 or 75 in @D@S...|pg||
pc|s3|nt|h_karluk: this carefully landed slam @d is <my review> kind of creme a la creme, deserved an applause and a corner in daily bulletin|pg||
pc|sT|nt|doctorone: They say one should lead an A in these auctions... Would someone consider leading the @s A? (not that it matters here)|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|d9|pc|c5|pc|h2|nt|h_karluk: ok, i think <my analyse> x 4th seat could serve well to find 9 cards @h fit for EW; I admit 1NT also not bad with 15 balanced, but a problem arose after 2@s rebid of opener|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|d3|mc|7|nt|bjacobs: I would consider it, but the explanation is key.  North could have an off-centre hand|pg||
