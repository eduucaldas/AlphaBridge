nt|h_karluk: if original multi i play = a) weak 2 majors b) 2NT (19-21 balanced with 4/5 cards) c) any 4441 then I cannot pass as North. On the other hand with 4 cards at the other major that's ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: an irregular opening bid. Pass fine with me.|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: sorry missed the play ...|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Was it alerted, I think alertable call that I have @D|pg||

nt|Walddk4: http://nbbuitslagen.transfer-solutions.com/uss/goPage14.do?rndid=76228&verid=778&catid= for detailed results|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: moreover multi 2@d defense is not a very hard to remember tool|pg||
mb|p|nt|harmon: ty Jan|pg||
pc|d8|nt|mdgraham: 2@D transfer, 2@s=break (good heart fit) |pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: explanation was asked and given but could not understand|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dQ|nt|jcwla: Not sure what the double of 4@D is -- some pairs play "double up" or "double down" of splinters asking for leads of low/high side suits.  Maybe not on same wavelength here.|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No - the russians are very fair|pg||
nt|mdgraham: followed by 4@D either splinter or (more likely) transfer at the four-level|pg||
nt|Walddk4: There is another match taking place simultaneously, so they are going to calculate an aggregate score by the end of the day I suppose|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Four pairs in each team. We have four of them at our visible tables (open and closed room) and another four at two "invisible" tables in order to give new operators some practise|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: diamond and the director was called to establish the revoke and we're continuing|pg||

nt|kareno: The way this works, spectators, is that for a given set, one team sits first then the seeded team sits where they like.  The seed passes from team to team according to the ...|pg||
nt|kareno: conditions of contest, each team being seeded for two quarters.|pg||
pc|c4|nt|Vugraphzfb: Director has ruled that there is a 1 trick penalty for the revoke.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Still the question is: Have Boye and Silla made up a psycologic against Geir and Tor?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Brogeland asks whether he could have asked and is told that he could have.|pg||
nt|sharkey: Fatigue factor coming into play perhaps - late in the contest|pg||

nt|stewball: not clear what that was....|pg||
pc|sT|nt|jcwla: Another possibility is to use "double up/down" when vul but dbl suggesting a sac when not vul.  As between double up or down, there is a slight theoretical advantage to down b/c ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: you _could_ bid the up suit at the same level.|pg||

nt|vugraphzgq: E in the tank|pg||

nt|mdgraham: maybe I am too old, but 3@S seems pushing it a bit on that East hand - maybe 2@S would have meant something different|pg||
nt|jcwla: I agree with you, Mike.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: what, about being too old?|pg||
nt|jcwla: Yes, did you say something else?|pg||
nt|panja: 3@S is certainly a self-preempting bid, W has to P or bid game...in essence, guess|pg||
nt|hawe45:  So do I, but West could have had the right values, @d-values are not interesting.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://nbbuitslagen.transfer-solutions.com/uss/goPage14.do?rndid=76228&verid=778&catid=  for results|pg||

pc|h8|pc|hQ|pc|h5|nt|chessmaste: The opening bid is in a style that the Italians like to play, but it was probably invented in the 40's by Marjorie Burns as part of the Nottingham Club|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Verhees: "well played"|pg||
nt|h_karluk: long tranches without sound reason, some attention needed by TDs|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|panja: perhaps, a stronger invitation than 3@C might have been more apppropriate..but what that could be is difficult to judge|pg||
pc|c9|nt|kareno: West's is not a really attractive hand.  I think 3@c was enough.|pg||
nt|sharkey: 5@C OR|pg||
nt|panja: how did the bidding go?|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c6|pc|c5|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sA|nt|mdgraham: one good thing about transfer responses to 1@C is that they do help to identify the nature of the fit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: which can be very useful in competitive auctions|pg||

nt|vugraphzgq: it was a combination of bad light and misclick :-)|pg||

pc|h3|pc|hJ|nt|chessmaste: leaving declarer a trick short|pg||
nt|jcwla: One often leads a trump against preference auctions.  Here, E has preferred @D's over @S's with the pass of 2@D.  However, N's weak @S length suggested a different lead to him.|pg||

nt|vugraphzgq: don't think so, try to find out|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@S natural? ( I have two spades..)|pg||
nt|panja: this must be 4@H and 5 minor..|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: 4/5@H no 4@S inv.|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: is what Drijver wrote as explanation|pg||
nt|panja: y, that seems the appropriate one|pg||
nt|mdgraham: unusual to set up a game force with only 7 hcp opposite 15-17, but I guess AK109x is a good suit|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|mb|2D!|an|min no 3!S|nt|kareno: Good stop.  |pg||
nt|h_karluk: 3@s alert is a complete joke|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Jansma provides "max, good @H-suit + shortness in ?"|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: so it's not a joke ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: if this is invitational I must have an out-of-date CC for EW.|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: exactly same expl. now given by Brink|pg||
nt|hawe45:  In the good old days, brave men would invite (maybe) with this East-hand|pg||
mb|2S|nt|vugraphzgq: they are constantly working on their system|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, this is jolly good, thinks South|pg||
nt|panja: but after all this complicated construct, all that they have managed to achieve is to play in a 43 fit at a rather high level|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Netherlands, near Vorden|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Four pairs in each team. We have four of them at our visible tables (open and closed room) and another four at two "invisible" tables in order to give new operators some practise|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: their 2@C is different: either 6+@C, 10-15, or 5+@S, 4+@c|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - with the suit 6-0 against them - good luck|pg||
nt|mdgraham: as a matter of doing the job, we download available CC s when we can - but as we have seen there, players do change systems and the CC's can get out-of-date.  |pg||

nt|xenya: 4@C on Qxxxx ?|pg||
nt|stewball: now S has easy 5@c imo|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Geir had a very difficult lead I think|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Boye hadn't turned the diamond ten upside down and laughingly did so, implying he had been holding Helge up, but not|pg||
nt|dinos1: X was t/o - short @h|pg||
mb|3H|nt|vugraphzgq: sry|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  On a @D-lead, 3 NT might make easily here|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: 2@H: usually without stopper in @D|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Perhaps Hans would care to suggest a route to 3NT?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No route - but that happens often...|pg||
nt|xenya: i'm about to change my verdict -- seems they are on their way to 5@C (at least?)|pg||
mb|4C|nt|panja: when in doubt, lead a trump!|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: 3@D no 4M, 4+ @D|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: 3@H asks @D|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: 3@S = 4 (?)|pg||
nt|yuval10: even with the advertised 8 @c's support|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: mind you, this is a bit of a perfect fit - reaching 6@D is by no means simple|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: he must have miscounted his fingers before bidding 3@S :-))|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ok ..let's study the hand. say 4/4 minors, they start with @d, so opener in 4th seat vs vul has obv 5@c/4@d - my vote is : ok to S's X, no to pass - i wld bid 3@c over 2@s in ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: competition|pg||
nt|yuval10: 8@c fir that is|pg||
nt|yuval10: *fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: asks @D honors, not cards :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: although on a low diamond to the ten and jack, North plays clubs...West gets in and plays @D8 through.....East can switch to a heart for another diamond|pg||
nt|chessmaste: in 3@C declarer has no problems|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: he thinks he has ...|pg||

mb|1N!|an|GF relay|nt|rhelle: 1NT = relay|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D!|nt|Walddk2: 1NT game-forcing|pg||
nt|rhelle: 2@d = 4@s or 3-suited|pg||
nt|cicus: is 1@D unbalanced from the start?|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle: Yes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4+ diamonds although it can be 3 with 4135 or 1435|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Rob said that yesterday|pg||
nt|rhelle: correct|pg||
nt|rhelle: 2@h will be another relay|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 6@c is the only slam with good odds|pg||
mb|2H|an|relay|nt|rhelle: I'm sure that that's where they will end up|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6@C is the better slam because you have more clubs between you so that a ruff is less likely|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: As we see, 6@S can go down|pg||
mb|3C|an|Exactly 4!S2!h5!d2!c|nt|rhelle: 3@c = 4=2=5=2|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D!|an|relay|nt|rhelle: 3@d = control ask|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: well, anyone for coming in with the East hand with 2@H?|pg||
mb|4C!|an|5 A=2 K=1)|nt|rhelle: 4@c = 5 controls (A=2, K=1)|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: it would have the merit of breaking the relay|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No thank you, Gábor|pg||
mb|4D!|an|relay|mb|p|nt|rhelle: 4@D = location of key cards ask|pg||
mb|4S!|an|!DA/K no !S A/K|nt|rhelle: 4@s shows the A or K of @d, but denies @s A or K|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am impressed that they can remember all this|pg||
nt|rhelle: it's actually very straightforward|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 6@hX is a 1100 save:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle: 7@C is still quite possible - switch the @h Ace and @c Ace|pg||
mb|4N|an|Relay|mb|p|nt|rhelle: so 4NT continues to ask|pg||
mb|5D!|an|A/K in !H no A/K in !C|nt|cicus: can they still stop in 5 something?|pg||
nt|rhelle: 5@d shows a @H top card (A, K or Q) and denies a @c top honour|pg||
nt|rhelle: in 5@s, yes|pg||
mb|p|mb|6C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Well done|pg||
nt|rhelle: you'd be surprised how easy this is to learn - the same principles always apply|pg||
mb|p|nt|rhelle: hence the name "symmetric relay precision"|pg||
nt|rhelle: it's symmetric - so the patterns repeat everywhere|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: The only problem is you can't controll who wll be declarer|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Say Khoklov had overcalled 2@H as Gábor suggested. How are they going to proceed from there?|pg||
nt|rhelle: true - but the BIG advantage is that one hand remains completely concealed, so the lead is more or less blind|pg||
nt|rhelle: and most contracts hinge on the lead|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|s2|pc|h2|pc|hA|pg||

nt|rnmalik: 20:20|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|hawe45:  This 3 NT must be played by North|pg||

mb|2C|mb|p|nt|vugraphzgq: here you are Hans|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Gromow got the message|pg||
nt|dinos1: that's why better bid 4@c|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|yuval10: nice X by W|pg||
nt|dinos1: pass is impossible|pg||
mb|3C|nt|bjacobs: North stays away from Michaels - not sure why|pg||
nt|yuval10: they'll find the @s fit now, but N will probably compete to 3m|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i guess that overcall worths to discuss in an experts panel on any bridge magazine|pg||
nt|dinos1: 6@c here|pg||
nt|stewball: cautious pass|pg||
nt|xenya: need an undo here|pg||
nt|dutcho: dont think he passed that|pg||
nt|dinos1: in 6@s - @c ruff|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: most any lead will sell a trick here..|pg||
nt|panja: not a @S though|pg||
nt|chessmaste: There are 3 losers in 5@D, so they have to reach 3NT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: difficult now |pg||
nt|chessmaste: Very|pg||
nt|mdgraham: admirably direct|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: and Dubinin too :-)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  ThatÂ´s what happens, when you bid 1 @H with this West-hand|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Safety?|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|Vugraphzfb: Helness: "nice" Silla: "nice" - different intonations, sorry I can't do them|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Forcing.,..?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But still no 9 tricks|pg||
nt|mdgraham: @H10 lead would be an easy set (East must get in with @CK) but a low heart is reasonable  |pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: all results on http://www.nbbportal.nl/7024/clubcompetitie_2.html|pg||
mb|d|nt|vugraphzgq: sry I was disturbed|pg||
nt|xenya: np Marc|pg||
mb|r|nt|yuval10: if it's 4+ m then perhaps he'll avoid it..but it's very likely for P to have 5-5 when he's red|pg||
nt|rnmalik: that is true|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Are they convering in English at the table Jan?|pg||
nt|sharkey: conversing*|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Mostly in Norwegian, but that was English - don't know if it's the same word|pg||
nt|hawe45:  With a decent @H-suit in West, all @H-lead works|pg||
nt|dutcho: neither do I actually|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and obviousl that would be a two parter question : a) would you overcall with 2@h b) what would be your bid over NT opener's X|pg||
nt|dinos1: 5@h wd be exclusion blkw?|pg||
nt|xenya: they won't reach a @S contract if they don't agree the suit|pg||
nt|stewball: not sure how redbl helps pard here|pg||
mb|3N|nt|Vugraphzfb: They also call the cards in Norwegian, so I have to watch the dummy|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: South knows that North is limited by the non-strong 1@C opening  |pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: short break as the late lunch arrived and players make their choice from the rolls|pg||
nt|mdgraham: a bit unlucky, really. @HAKQ wasted|pg||
mb|4C|nt|dutcho: this will be interesting|pg||
nt|bjacobs: In a way, the lower 2@H bid is more dangerous than the higher 2@S bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Dont have "nice" in Norwegian - or anything close...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: There is no word for nice in Norwegian|pg||
nt|Walddk4: :)|pg||
nt|hlortz: the truth comes out!|pg||
nt|panja: N playing for doubleton @CH with E|pg||
nt|jcwla: 9 more to Russia on 4 - where EW here played 3@H-2, S in the OR played 2@H-2.|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: all pairs rotate on the different teams for the selector wants to see how the different combinations score|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: So every round 'Nederland 1' plays against 'Rusland 1' but the teams may or may not contain the same players|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: W still thinking|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This layout was not a whole lot away from a re-opening double by West, passed by East, for a large number|pg||
mb|4D|nt|sharkey: yes there is Roland - may be not in Danish|pg||
mb|p|nt|chessmaste: It looks odd, but given that South was a pased hand should North prefer 2NT to 3@D?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: egg and bacon for me please |pg||
nt|xenya: perhaps N is going to take command?|pg||
nt|dinos1: hard to get much from S who bid spades w/o AK|pg||
mb|5N|nt|dutcho: both x and 3@C are possible rebids with west|pg||
mb|p|nt|stewball: hm|pg||
nt|xenya: sounds mysterious  |pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|nt|dburn:  well, North didnt have to bid on - he might conclude that South would not have @cA or @cK since he could have bid 3NT if so|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Those Danich:)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: on @H void is it not difficult|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: 'spade finesse, 1 or 2 down'|pg||
nt|dinos1: 5N - ask @cA or "choose slam"?|pg||
nt|xenya: not to S though|pg||
mb|p|nt|hlortz: tho trusting a Dane's comment about Norwegians.. doubtful|pg||
nt|panja: the @D duck encouraged a losing @C finesse, it seems..|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: and similar Nederland 2 vs Rusland 2|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Now an endplay against West in the red suits|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - but for 1 down|pg||
nt|xenya: well done |pg||
nt|stewball: invitation to disaster unless its clear|pg||
nt|stewball: and perhaps it was to S|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: 5NT: "bid 7 with good club"|pg||
nt|dinos1: thk 5N was grand slam force|pg||
nt|dutcho: well they got to the top spot|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: N has shown strong with @C, 1st rnd ctrl @H, S showed @D ctrl and 5@D with 4@S|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hA|pc|h4|nt|yuval10: N would've done better to unblock the @d's|pg||

mb|3C|nt|cicus: is 3@H forcing here for you?|pg||
nt|rhelle: I think so|pg||
nt|rhelle: F1R|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I must say that I prefer 4@C. You know you have at least 10 trumps between you so they are not going to double for penalty. Besides, it takes much more room away from LHO|pg||
nt|rhelle: totally agree - 3@c is a wuss bid|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4D|nt|rhelle: now 4@d as an invite|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: discussion of the hand, but it's in Norwegian so I can't tell you anything, sorry|pg||
nt|dburn:  still, I suppose South might have had @dA, in which case 5@d might not be a lot worse than the spade finesse|pg||
nt|dutcho: I silent 2@S for NS?|pg||
mb|2C|an|Precision|nt|yuval10: likely to be a good score for EW, the competitive hands are the most important in such a level!|pg||
mb|2D|mb|4C|nt|chessmaste: It was awkward to be sure|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 1NT would have been interesting and EW got into makeable contract|pg||

nt|dinos1: as 4@c|pg||
mb|4H|nt|rodal f: Hehehe Go on Roland and we start for full speed.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This hand demonstrates just how right it is to open 1NT as North|pg||
nt|h_karluk: quite suitable shape for 2@d/2@h F****ry convention with N's collection|pg||
mb|d|nt|bjacobs: 1NT makes; 2@S doesn't|pg||
nt|dutcho: I was wrong again:)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Maybe a heart lead to 1NT would prove me wrong as well|pg||
nt|dinos1: pushed them to overbid|pg||
mb|p|nt|dutcho: well good look by Gert-Jan Paulissen|pg||
nt|dutcho: yes and both north and south have their bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: NS hold the balance of strength, however, since S has almost all, EW will come to more tricks than NS|pg||
mb|5D|nt|sharkey: Much of the Norwegian language originates from Danish - in addition we have dialect Norwegian, "nynorsk"|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Untraditional 12-14 NT|pg||

mb|d|nt|chessmaste: That looks to be a good lead|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Are you surprised at that lead?  |pg||
nt|dutcho: this lead also attacks the only direct entry to dummy|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  Long day here - for East|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not usually recommended, leading from jack to four |pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: 4th best, 2nd from xxxx|pg||
nt|jcwla: This looks like 5-4 inv'l and Brink passes with a prime submin.|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Sjoert confirms 15-17 with a smile|pg||
nt|hawe45:  We still think, that West has promised 15-17?|pg||

mb|p|nt|mdgraham: then that is some upgrade|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Bachar Abouchanab|pg||
nt|dinos1: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: S knows he has no ruffing value in @h contract but his partner has plenty in @s contract|pg||
pc|c8|nt|dutcho: well I would just lead my longest suit @D|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|doctorone: Good morning all :)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|yuval10: a nice lead by W to begin with|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|sharkey: Helness opened light to get @D lead - may actually help Boye|pg||
nt|panja: S can get two possible entrie to Dummy to play @H, @SJ and @CQ..|pg||
nt|panja: W can deny him the @SJ entry by ducking @SQ..|pg||
nt|dutcho: hi Bachar|pg||
nt|yuval10: but with the favourable place of the A@c it looks likely that declarer will make|pg||
nt|h_karluk: west picked the way to ruff with his master trump|pg||
nt|xenya: just 1 down?|pg||
nt|dinos1: yeah|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|nt|chessmaste: They did not look for a major fit, so North preferred a heart to a diamond|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I would have played bak a @H in trick 2|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Seeing West unblock the @H Queen|pg||
nt|dburn:  not clear why South preferred a spade to a heart, though|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true |pg||
nt|hawe45:  Kill dummy|pg||
pc|s6|nt|bjacobs: Against 1NT passed out, it's quite a good idea to lead your stronger major, as a principle|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sK|pc|s5|pc|s9|pg||
pc|cK|nt|dutcho: well usually partner has several ways to bid if he has 1 or 2 majors|pg||
nt|bjacobs: East has 11 points - it's not surprising partner has passed |pg||
nt|bjacobs: So that argument tends to come more into play when opening leader is weak|pg||
nt|dutcho: that is true so maybe that is an indication why he found this|pg||
pc|c2|pc|sJ|nt|rodal f: And "nynorsk" was the norwegian language, but some danes tryed to press an other language at the norwegians. Learn to play scoccer danes:)|pg||
nt|dburn:  still, North is prepared to stick with his original idea|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Is that a new Tarantinio movie?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: sorry east|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like declarer has picked the wrong line|pg||
nt|rnmalik: and he has made it difficult for himself|pg||
nt|h_karluk: another spade to K|pg||
nt|h_karluk: than a @h to hand still not bad|pg||
nt|yuval10: @h return must be from a singelton, so E is a lot more likely to have @s length than W|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|panja: did he duck @CJ?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|hawe45:  Come on declarer - your @D-trick...!|pg||
nt|dburn:  well, it is customary for declarer to wait for South|pg||
nt|mdgraham: who will probably discard a heart |pg||
nt|hawe45:  Sry - had not seen thT...|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mdgraham: hmm|pg||
nt|mdgraham: still going down though|pg||
nt|hawe45:  The 5-card @S is unknown for South|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sharkey: So West will be endplayed|pg||
nt|yuval10: W did well not to jump, otherwise he's giving the contract away|pg||
nt|h_karluk: now @h switch a must|pg||
nt|yuval10: declarer might still hope for 3-2 @h and play K@s before @h|pg||
nt|rnmalik: he has no other option|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @s K then @h small a bonus|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|rnmalik: -1|pg||
nt|yuval10: now E can choose how does he want this contract down...the stright way with 2 ruffs of @h or the longer way :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 2 ruufs better|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ruff, play a @c get 2nd @h ruff|pg||
nt|yuval10: perhaps better ruff if you're affraid of KQ@d in S|pg||
nt|yuval10: if declarer has the A@c it won't matter anyway|pg||
pc|c5|nt|dutcho: for us it is easy to see east has to play clubs|pg||
nt|doctorone: E may opt for a @d now, not willing to provide an entry for an eventula @s finesse|pg||

nt|sharkey: Nice|pg||

nt|cicus: hi Adam|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hello Adam|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Mullers opening can create some problems for W:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://nbbuitslagen.transfer-solutions.com/uss/goPage14.do?rndid=76228&verid=778&catid=  for results and individual standings|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't think so, Ralf. The auction has revealed that de Wijs has most of the missing points, not Muller|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The double of 1NT is not a psyche, so 1@H must be|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If S has a 5-card @h and @dK:)|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: right, it actually simplified matters|pg||
pc|cT|pc|d2|pc|s3|pc|cA|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h2|pc|h4|pc|h5|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am asked if I can explain the use of an opening like this. Well, 3rd in hand, non-vulnerable against vulnerable opponents, it's almost a mandatory psyche|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And there is nothing illegal about it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: As long as it is not based on a partnership *understanding*|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: I wouldn't say mandatory, there are some hands very unsuitable for psyching, but I think was a good spot... I have to admit, I probably would have bid 1@s instead of 1@H|pg||
nt|rhelle: indeed - and De Wijs doubled 1NT as he should|pg||

pc|d9|pc|dK|pc|dJ|pc|d5|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If de Wijs has seen this many many times, he should alert 1@H and explain if asked. "1@H shows 11-15 and 5+ hearts, but I have seen on a few occasions that this may not be the case ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: in this position"|pg||
mc|10|nt|Walddk2: Remember that de Wijs bid as if 1@H was normal|pg||

mb|p|nt|yuval10: so another very good score for EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|harmon: they slowed down at the other table|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Possible + for NL here - 5 @D looks rather ambitious|pg||

mb|1N|nt|jcwla: Kaplan/Rubens evaluated it to 13.5: http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=J75+AK+98+AT7653|pg||
nt|h_karluk: east doesn't have 12?|pg||
nt|yuval10: E didn't open his hand which is quite remarkable nowadays :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Instead of @S Ace had he played small @C he would have made it|pg||
mb|p|nt|chessmaste: 3NT making looks good - in the other room South led the king of diamonds!|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Just what East wanted, the bidding at 4@C by the time it got back to him|pg||
nt|chessmaste: At least he won't go down in 3NT|pg||
mb|3N|nt|yuval10: 3@h - 4@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|doctorone: yes... I think for NT to be playable, you hope for some @s support anyhow|pg||

pc|hT|nt|dutcho: very nice defense by EW on board 8.|pg||

nt|yuval10: E figure out that 9 tricks are easier than 10.... a bit dangerous in this hand but might succeed|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|mdgraham: double by North surely shows spades - reckon 3@S by South here, and then over to West|pg||
nt|yuval10: 4@h would've gone down with @c lead so this might create a swing too|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Is there any chance for @S lead|pg||
nt|yuval10: no....but red suit lead will make it interesting|pg||
nt|yuval10: @c lead will give 9th trick right away|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @S would snatch 5 right away:)|pg||
pc|c8|nt|vugraphzgq: a rather quick pass|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but West can't double with his hand, surely, even after the redouble from East |pg||
pc|c3|pc|cK|nt|hlortz: 5@C would be in jeopardy if K@H in other hand|pg||
nt|rodal f: A new flatty by the nice @D layout? Or slamtry by 5@C as end?|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|rnmalik: good lead let the declarer work for the 9th|pg||
nt|yuval10: of course S can discard over 6@h's 4@c's and one @d and still beat the contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: GJP now studying opp's carding|pg||
nt|yuval10: but it's not so easy as it looks like|pg||
nt|rnmalik: at times it becomes hard for the defender to analyise that a contract has been bid without @S stopper|pg||
nt|yuval10: N should signal @s to his P in any way he can, mostly by the order of the @h's he'll play|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|jcwla: Russia did bid and make 6@D on 6 so 12 more, up 31-9.|pg||

nt|vugraphzgq: bye|pg||
pc|c6|nt|Vugraphzfb: Helness explaining what Helgemo has shown to Silla, but in Norwegian - I think that 3@c promised clubs and was forcing to game, but that's just from the body language|pg||
nt|sharkey: As Henry mentioned they have "rightsided" the contract so shudnt be anything to the play|pg||
nt|panja: could W have rebid 3@H on 3@D to keep alive chances of playing in 3NT? or should E have rebid 3N instead of 3@D?|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cA|pg||
nt|hawe45:  22 IMPÂ´s board 5 - when did we see that score...?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 6@Dx+1 at one table, 6@Sx+1 at the other|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Russia made a doubled slam +1 in both rooms|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Both doubling pairs lost an overtrick also|pg||
nt|mdgraham: cost an imp, that|pg||
nt|rnmalik: That was some hand to think of it|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Nice score in a 10-board-match|pg||

nt|h_karluk: yes sir :)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|yuval10: normal bidding so far|pg||

pc|s2|nt|Vugraphzfb: Helness "Ah Ha"|pg||
pc|sT|nt|sharkey: I believe most of us wud lead @SQ....|pg||
nt|panja: from the bidding S knows that W is close to 15-17 Nt range...|pg||
nt|panja: and hasn't opened 1Nt....|pg||
nt|sharkey: N may try low @S for 2. @C ruff - S does not have stiff @S view opening lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Helness said something and I sort of leaned forward questioningly and he says "it ain't easy I tell them" :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: After the last chat in Norwegian I told them I couldn't do my job properly if they spoke in Norwegian, that you all expected me to tell you what was going on|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But in fact, they were in "bid accurately" mode|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 4@S a better contract|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|doctorone: an option, surely, Bill|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think 3@d out of issue - i liked 3@h |pg||

nt|rnmalik: But why the !J@D and not the Ace-education for me|pg||
nt|yuval10: going even|pg||
nt|yuval10: i think he persume that from KT9 (XX) they lead T ( or 9 )|pg||
nt|h_karluk: still believe vs vul fair enough to play aggressive|pg||
nt|yuval10: then if P led from K9XXX and no entries it's very good play|pg||
nt|h_karluk: true|pg||
nt|h_karluk: presumably that's intelligent|pg||
nt|rnmalik: In that case if declarer has AKQ@H there is no defence|pg||

pc|s4|pc|s9|pc|sJ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|yuval10: indeed, only time it will lose is when declarer has this holding in @d and AKQ@h, together with A@c|pg||
nt|h_karluk: imo this board most probably would not gain anything |pg||
nt|yuval10: but it sounds like too much....perhaps he'd have bid 3@d with such a holding|pg||

nt|xenya: will EW go for a save?|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: from now on each trick very valuable for both sides, no luxury to omit or stretch any principle |pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Sine EW cud make 2@H cud be a pick up fro Strul|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d7|nt|dutcho: this hand is a lot easier for us than for Jansma|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I suppose you play for a cross ruff here|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 2 diamonds tricks and 8 trumps on a cross ruff?  |pg||
nt|dutcho: North can discard his red cards on the clubs and the spades in hand are very small|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That is certainly what he's thinking about - how many hearts will he be able to ruff?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: An alternative is a double ruffing heart finesse|pg||
nt|dutcho: yes maybe double finesse in hearts?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: snap|pg||

nt|xenya: on 12, the Russian E in OR somehow managed to make 4@S (no trump lead) -- 13 imps to Russia|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|h_karluk: but say North opener, how they say, overbidding? ok then it's possible no matter vulnerability|pg||
nt|rnmalik: The biggest problem S has that he has no quick entry to his hand|pg||
pc|s2|nt|h_karluk: as twice passed hand transportation problem quite expected|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h5|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Perhaps cash the diamonds now, before the mice get at them|pg||

mb|p|nt|panja: y...a dbl of 3@S is not unreasonable...chance of 500|pg||
nt|rnmalik: appears so|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: N mumbles something like sorry I am a little light|pg||
nt|h_karluk: groans and grimaces barred sir, scowling free :)|pg||
nt|dinos1: 2@h now|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Y|pg||
nt|sharkey: Helgemo's 3@S is not for the faint of heart|pg||
nt|panja: that is after the raise to 2@S..|pg||
nt|panja: I feel the raise in not warranted....E hand is too weak for that..|pg||
mb|p|pc|d7|nt|bjacobs: But Jansma is not prepared to parlay it ... so he makes the blame transfer bid|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Jansma just wants it to end!|pg||
nt|doctorone: This is getting awkward :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: he is looking like that|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think he has to prefer back to 4@H now|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Incredibly, even that horrible contract might make|pg||
nt|doctorone: Usually, my feeling here is: "Why is this just happening to me whenever I open such a hand?" :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Actually, I suppose repeated spade leads will ruin 4@H ... so it looks like E/W are heading for a minus, the question will be: how big a minus|pg||
nt|doctorone: I dont think he may make 4@h, Bill. The @s lead will cause control problems likely|pg||
nt|rnmalik: In the OR N bid 1NT and that disturbed the entire hand|pg||
nt|dinos1: X showed @s?|pg||
nt|xenya: was penalty based on the strength in spades|pg||
nt|rodal f: In my world U Serge.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Y|pg||

pc|h2|nt|sharkey: Vul I think raise ok Prakasj - @HK behind and nice side suit|pg||
nt|yuval10: 9 points but his X works out perfect here|pg||
nt|yuval10: 1NT was probably raptor|pg||
nt|yuval10: 4@h and a minor|pg||
nt|h_karluk: now south plays comfortably with his tricipital muscle , 1@s and x draws the big picture in his mind|pg||

nt|h_karluk: you are always welcomed|pg||
pc|sT|nt|marlowepi: W short in Ds and has doubled.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: yes can play low @C to any card in hand and finesse the K or Q@C again, divided honours or KQx@C in W-thinking|pg||
nt|yuval10: declarer can play @d now and then he'll easily see the whole picture|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Nothing wrong with it, though. Tough lead and it's touch and go between a diamond and a heart|pg||
nt|mtvesuvius: guess I shouldn't speak until I've completely seen the hand... no ruff is possible, but declarer will get tapped out in his hand, not enough time to draw trump and establish clubs|pg||

nt|h_karluk: i meant if xx rexfer then what's 2@s|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|nt|doctorone: Given that N simply bid 2@h previous round, S did not consider any further action, reasonnably enough|pg||
nt|h_karluk: how much HCP alowed etc|pg||
nt|h_karluk: *allowed|pg||
pc|d2|nt|yuval10: declarer will simply duck 2@h's and will make his contract |pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|hA|nt|rnmalik: playable contract|pg||
nt|h_karluk: quite reasonable|pg||
nt|yuval10: the 3-3 in both @c and @d surely helps|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @H position to be guessed|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Jansma asking about leads|pg||
nt|h_karluk: how about @s hook and K position|pg||
nt|h_karluk: can declarer afford to play @s A then @s J to preserve a tempo|pg||
nt|rnmalik: If he can duck @H twice he makes|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i bet with a void trying to calculate possibilities|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h2|pc|s4|pg||

nt|dinos1: dcl must play @d ruff @h then cash @cA - it's too obvious for N|pg||
nt|rodal f: If @CK don't come now...|pg||
nt|dinos1: important to cash @d earlier|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Four pairs in each team. We have four of them at our visible tables (open and closed room) and another four at two "invisible" tables in order to give new operators some practise|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Netherlands, near Vorden|pg||
nt|merijng: de wijs has to switch to hearts to beat the contract|pg||
nt|cicus: ah thanks|pg||
nt|merijng: he is prob thinking whether muller lead from kxx or x spade|pg||
nt|rhelle: you sure? doesn't declarer always lose 1@H and 1@C now?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not if he returns a spade|pg||
nt|cicus: if he can ruff out @SK and takes @D finesse the @H loser vanishes|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h5|pc|h3|pc|hA|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s5|nt|rhelle: dangerous - if he takes the ruffing finesse, he's 2 off|pg||
nt|cicus: at the crossroads: shall he play for a make?|pg||
nt|merijng: decl tried to make with king of spade onside|pg||
nt|merijng: but unlikely since south bid 4H on only 3crd|pg||
nt|cicus: yes, S must hold @SK for his bidding|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: Declarer took a look at the convention card|pg||
nt|cicus: szia|pg||
pc|h4|pc|sK|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|merijng: will prob ruff now and play a heart, south should take and return ace and another club and east will always make on double squeeze with king of spades in south|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h8|pc|h7|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Make?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That would be 3 defensive tricks|pg||
nt|merijng: down 1 ±'|pg||
nt|cicus: spec tells me declarer was misled by the lead of @HQ, thinking S had @HK|pg||
nt|merijng: after losing heart :)|pg||
nt|rhelle: Yes, that is true - that @hQ was a cunning card|pg||
nt|ralfwil: claim for -2|pg||
