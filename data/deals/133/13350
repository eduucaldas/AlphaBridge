nt|royhughes: Both pairs are playing 5-card majors|pg||
nt|royhughes: Brown-Kanetkar play strong NT, Lusk-Chan weak|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|mb|p|nt|patricck: 7@C by West is a borderline reasonable grand slam|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|patricck: if the trumps behave then you have the chance of a 3-3 @S break before you have to try the @D finesse|pg||
nt|royhughes: It is better played by West, so that you can't get a diamond lead through the ace|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|royhughes: 2@c is 10+ with clubs|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: aVI THINBKING|pg||
nt|patricck: So that is 36% chance with 50% of the rest, which = 68%, but then only 68% of 89% because of the possibility of Qxx of @C offside|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: OOop Avi thinking|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4D!|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|patricck: I make that just over 60% for the grand if played by West|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|royhughes: Your math looks good to me|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugrapha1: Avi passed reluctantly|pg||

mc|13|nt|vugrapha1: a  lot of discussion under the screens|pg||
nt|royhughes: So if you bid 6, you may win points without the risk of going down|pg||

nt|vugrapha1: Terry apologising|pg||
nt|royhughes: I think the IMP odds on bidding 7 are close to even, if you know the other table is in 6|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|patricck: Yes, so the fact they might have had an accident and stopped in 5@C swings the odds in favour of staying in 6@C|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|royhughes: That has been my bitter experience|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|royhughes: Chan has an odd hand here, with 8 of his 11 points in the opponents' suit|pg||
mb|3D!|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cQ|nt|royhughes: They have underbid it -- is anyone to blame here?|pg||
pc|c6|nt|patricck: Yes, I understand why he stopped short of game, but unfortunately it is an easy 10 tricks|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cK|pg||
nt|royhughes: It is hard to be objective when looking at all 4 hands, and I don't know their style|pg||
nt|royhughes: The North hand looks like a raise to game to me, though|pg||
nt|patricck: They both look like borderline choices for bidding one more|pg||
nt|patricck: North's choice depends how bad South can be tobalance|pg||
nt|royhughes: Yes, I think so.  Funny -- only the ace of diamonds is working for the South hand|pg||
nt|patricck: and the singleton club! :)|pg||
nt|patricck: that is what makes in from the North point of view, could have been several club losers|pg||

nt|royhughes: The South hand doesn't really look like NT|pg||
nt|patricck: It has been played at one other table so far...  3@C making for +110|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|royhughes: Kanetkar doesn't open his borderline hand with good spots|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|nt|royhughes: 1@c for NS can be as short as 2|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|royhughes: I wonder if the 1@s rebid shows that the clubs were long|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: it was alerted late and dpnt hve a copy of thir system sorry|pg||
nt|patricck: Close isn't it?..... perhaps having the 10@D in the suit you are opening might swing it|pg||
nt|royhughes: If so, Lusk might give preference to 2@c|pg||
mb|2C|mb|d|nt|royhughes: That's what their convention card implies -- 1@s meant the clubs were real|pg||
nt|royhughes: South might continue with 2@h to show his pattern|pg||
nt|royhughes: It's a promising hand, but all North's values are in diamonds|pg||
mb|r|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|royhughes: I forgot about East!  He came in with his decent hand and short clubs|pg||
mb|3C|nt|royhughes: Yes, not my choice either|pg||
mb|3H|nt|royhughes: So Chan got a chance to redouble and now bids a simple 3@c|pg||
nt|patricck: Only 3 cards in the only unbid suit.. it looks a bit racy to me|pg||

nt|vugrapha1: toilet break for a couple at our table - notteam mates!!|pg||
nt|patricck: interesting that NOT opening the East hand is aggressive bidding :) but I see what you mean|pg||
nt|royhughes: Fair point -- would you have opened?|pg||
mb|p|nt|patricck: Not quite, give me the 10@D though I think it just gets there|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|royhughes: Kanetkar has passed his horrible 12-count here -- not many people pass with 12 nowadays|pg||

mb|1S|mb|5C|nt|patricck: After West opens the bidding it becomes a great slam because the club finesse is very likely onside. Very difficult for N/S to diagnose that and bid it though|pg||
mb|p|nt|royhughes: 6@c is a decent slam, and becomes better once West opens 1@s|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|hJ|nt|royhughes: Yes, and the defence has to lead a diamond to even have a chance|pg||
