nt|vugraphzgq: NS play a fairly natural system, 5M 3@C, 1NT 15-17|pg||
mb|4S|mb|5D|nt|panja: 4@h will make because @C K is in..not easy to bid though|pg||

nt|stewball: hi everyone|pg||
mb|5S|nt|panja: @DKQ seem like wasted values..|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Good morning everyone and welcome back to the Netherlands for a practise match between the host team and Russia. Three segments of 20 boards today|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Four pairs in each team. We have four of them at our visible tables (open and closed room) and another four at two "invisible" tables in order to give new operators some practise|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: first set 37-4 Russia. Score not carried forward? |pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Hi all welcome back|pg||
nt|dutcho: good afternoon all|pg||
pc|h8|nt|kareno: Fixed!!|pg||
nt|sharkey: Well done!|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello all and welcome|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Good judgement, @D better than @H|pg||
nt|roswolf: tasty hand to start|pg||
nt|sharkey: E need to switch to @H when in on @C first time to set this|pg||
nt|sharkey: assumed @D lead....|pg||
nt|sharkey: makes now|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm not the best lead but it is the first board of the day and a Sunday as well:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: I checked once more as he has @D8 too and the light is bad but it is really @H8|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Brink Drijver (a strong pair) use 5 Maj 5@D (except 4441), 2@C - Game Forcing is 2@C, 2@D@H@S weak with interesting auction after 2Maj open|pg||
nt|roswolf: ty giorio|pg||
nt|roswolf: giorgio- sorry|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: I am sitting close to Bas Drijver who is usually very helpfull in giving explanations to the audience|pg||
nt|roswolf: declarer in deep thought!?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: yes, still thinking|pg||
nt|sharkey: @C9 a key card too|pg||
nt|bridge_one: they use also 1NT open in first not vuln 9/12 (else 15/17) - multilandy vs NT but with 2@H/@S interesting hand also witouth minor out|pg||
pc|hT|nt|Walddk4: Our operator is Marc van Beijsterveldt|pg||

nt|rnmalik: welcome back|pg||
nt|h_karluk: if original multi i play = a) weak 2 majors b) 2NT (19-21 balanced with 4/5 cards) c) any 4441 then I cannot pass as North. On the other hand with 4 cards at the other major that's ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: an irregular opening bid. Pass fine with me.|pg||

pc|h3|pg||
nt|harmon: ty Jan|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mdgraham: 2@D transfer, 2@s=break (good heart fit) |pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: explanation was asked and given but could not understand|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s3|nt|jcwla: Not sure what the double of 4@D is -- some pairs play "double up" or "double down" of splinters asking for leads of low/high side suits.  Maybe not on same wavelength here.|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No - the russians are very fair|pg||
nt|mdgraham: followed by 4@D either splinter or (more likely) transfer at the four-level|pg||
nt|Walddk4: There is another match taking place simultaneously, so they are going to calculate an aggregate score by the end of the day I suppose|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Four pairs in each team. We have four of them at our visible tables (open and closed room) and another four at two "invisible" tables in order to give new operators some practise|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: imps are converted to VP and added up for both matches|pg||

nt|panja: post 1987.....asking could/would have led to UI...|pg||
nt|sharkey: *not|pg||
nt|harmon: Jan revoked???? tsk tsk|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: NS play 3way 1@C, 1@D 4+ may have longer @C 5cr M (9-16 HCP), 'destructive 2-level op.'|pg||
nt|h_karluk: When you play bridge you must be ready for conventions and their defense methods, otherwise you just let your opponents to walk like in a park|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: S now alerts 2@C but N didn't|pg||
nt|roswolf: diamonds seem to be the boss suit |pg||
nt|roswolf: wonder if redouble should show the south hand|pg||
mb|3H|nt|sharkey: she did on Tuesday too....|pg||
nt|dutcho: North has a horrible hand to lead from|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: W asking now|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3@H is a mysterious effort|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzgq: I guess S takes 2@C as Stay or so?|pg||
nt|roswolf: and the potential break is ominous|pg||
nt|roswolf: looks that way marc|pg||
mb|5C|nt|vugraphzgq: E asks and N says 'short'|pg||
nt|roswolf: curiouser and curiouser|pg||
mb|5D|nt|roswolf: the axe should fall|pg||
nt|bridge_one: kholomeev-khyuppenen use a classic 2/1 approach with any difference: 2@C also weak with @d, 2@D open = bal 18/19 (italian style) to have 1minor => 2Nt natural long suit strong ...|pg||
nt|bridge_one: hand, xefrt walsh after 1@C open, 1Nt response semiforcing|pg||
mb|d|nt|xenya: apparently the 2@C bid was not availbable here -- for some reason  |pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: 2@S and a @D|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this is an aggressive contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: E in the tank|pg||
nt|hawe45:  He will find nothing there|pg||
nt|mdgraham: maybe I am too old, but 3@S seems pushing it a bit on that East hand - maybe 2@S would have meant something different|pg||
nt|jcwla: I agree with you, Mike.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: what, about being too old?|pg||
nt|jcwla: Yes, did you say something else?|pg||
nt|panja: 3@S is certainly a self-preempting bid, W has to P or bid game...in essence, guess|pg||
nt|hawe45:  So do I, but West could have had the right values, @d-values are not interesting.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://nbbuitslagen.transfer-solutions.com/uss/goPage14.do?rndid=76228&verid=778&catid=  for results|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Four pairs in each team. We have four of them at our visible tables (open and closed room) and another four at two "invisible" tables in order to give new operators some practise|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  But to me, this is a contract, you might play a little faster|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Netherlands, near Vorden|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: e/w have overstretched|pg||
nt|bridge_one: seam signal og Brink/Drijver - small ancourage, reverse count|pg||
pc|hK|nt|panja: 5@C on @C finesse..|pg||
nt|sharkey: The speed has subseded a notch from the pace we ended previous session - so far only partials|pg||
nt|roswolf: ty giorgio|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|mdgraham: ah, double shows spades. So 2@s would be four-card support, 12-14-ish. 3@S looks better in that case.|pg||
nt|sharkey: sounds to me like EW have beein misinformed?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: also russiam pair is expert - so we will see a very good match here|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: declarer is not looking like calling for the TD but might come later|pg||
pc|h3|nt|Walddk4: http://www.panoramio.com/photo/5213107  for a photo of the venue, the Onstein Castle, owned by Hans Melchers, an avid bridge fan. The castle is located in the eastern part of the ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Netherlands, near Vorden|pg||
nt|stewball: if the def stays passive,this looks to drift 1 off|pg||
nt|xenya: yes|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|roswolf: quite possible - although east made an anti% bid imo|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s3|nt|chessmaste: The opening bid is in a style that the Italians like to play, but it was probably invented in the 40's by Marjorie Burns as part of the Nottingham Club|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Verhees: "well played"|pg||
nt|h_karluk: long tranches without sound reason, some attention needed by TDs|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|panja: perhaps, a stronger invitation than 3@C might have been more apppropriate..but what that could be is difficult to judge|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|kareno: West's is not a really attractive hand.  I think 3@c was enough.|pg||
nt|sharkey: 5@C OR|pg||
nt|panja: how did the bidding go?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1Nt for other minor ( or other major ) and 4cards maj is a gadget loved by netherland pair|pg||
nt|roswolf: cashing out in defence is one of the under practised arts of the game|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Instead Russian pair use 1NT overcall natural|pg||
nt|sharkey: cant see any tricks vanish here Geoff|pg||
nt|bridge_one: so possible to see the swings for this reason|pg||
nt|roswolf: true but it saves thinking time|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c8|pc|cA|pc|c2|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mdgraham: one good thing about transfer responses to 1@C is that they do help to identify the nature of the fit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: which can be very useful in competitive auctions|pg||
pc|d4|nt|h_karluk: if that was a club level game between oldies in a degree it could be acceptable. But that's an international event! Sorry, "technically" not nice.|pg||
pc|d7|nt|h_karluk: The right thing to do for NS is to call TD, point out what's going on at the table to preserve their rights in case alloted time exceeded|pg||

nt|vugraphzgq: Brink says indeed that 2@C has been explained as majors|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: N says no agreements over this type of 1NT so intended 2@C as natural|pg||
nt|bridge_one: normaly, in this situation, N/S arn't penalized|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: sorry short break as EW have no cc and Bas is now going to print one from his mailbox|pg||

nt|hawe45:  A trump-lead would - as almost always is the case - kill the contract, IÂ´m sure|pg||
nt|dutcho: Might be poor choice of words Bill|pg||
mb|p|nt|stewball: i expect E will get his @s in|pg||
nt|sharkey: can they get to slam here?|pg||
nt|roswolf: the 4-0 trump break may be troublesome|pg||
mb|2N|nt|panja: something wrong here..|pg||
nt|harmon: uhhm quit the bidding for NS|pg||
nt|panja: a P by brogeland to begin perhaps|pg||
nt|sharkey: 2@d-2@s-2 nt-3@c-5@c|pg||
nt|mdgraham: quiet contract |pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: little confusion as the 2@D card was missing|pg||
nt|bjacobs: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: break in tempo was with North|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 5@S will be interesting ... it might just make|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Although probably not|pg||
nt|xenya: and he did|pg||
nt|dutcho: like he did|pg||
nt|stewball: 4@s surely|pg||
nt|xenya: um -- KJ of hearts don't look too nice...|pg||
mb|p|nt|chessmaste: Declarer will win this and probably play a diamond|pg||
nt|panja: regulation lead|pg||
nt|jcwla: :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @D 7 is better|pg||
nt|panja: oh, I thought @D7 was led....|pg||
nt|panja: wasn't that the card that was showing earlier?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: it was a combination of bad light and misclick :-)|pg||
nt|roswolf: see no reason why not|pg||
mb|3H|nt|bjacobs: North might have to neutralize dummy's diamonds by playing 3 rounds of the suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzgq: he has a @D in hand now ...|pg||
nt|xenya: so a cautious 3|pg||
nt|stewball: the rest makes up for it|pg||
nt|bridge_one: East use a prudent approach, because know they are a terrible distribution, so don't give informations at opps|pg||
mb|4C!|nt|Vugraphzfb: Sorry, I was trying to get the other match fixed, hope I succeeded|pg||
nt|sharkey: So Zimmermann will regain the lead|pg||
nt|panja: 6@D here..touch and go|pg||
nt|harmon: yes he claims on any lead|pg||
nt|panja: @ST..boosts it to an easy make|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup silence is golden on this hand|pg||
nt|sharkey: South's cue shud be all N need here - may get too high?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: But seven @h are ON bec West have all small @H ... a J10xx was sufficient to beat the grand slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|chessmaste: Now he must play a trump|pg||
mb|6H|nt|panja: the problem for W is, he has too much strength in @H..and he now knows E is short|pg||
nt|sharkey: This is the final session of the semi finals - 14 boards to go|pg||
nt|xenya: well done|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|chessmaste: leaving declarer a trick short|pg||
nt|jcwla: One often leads a trump against preference auctions.  Here, E has preferred @D's over @S's with the pass of 2@D.  However, N's weak @S length suggested a different lead to him.|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  The finesse here has no sense|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|dutcho: 3@S looks right with the west cards|pg||
nt|xenya: 5@D NS is not such a bad save but they got nowhere near it|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - shud make|pg||
nt|roswolf: well north knows things fit well and has all the controls - might gamble on the doubleton spade in south's hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: the final bid was a bit agricultural|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|nt|bridge_one: North closure at 6 may be too much fast - the space to take other informations there are (any minor K was excellet for North)|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|kareno: Why touch and go?|pg||
nt|harmon: hell cash Q of d 1st in case d's 4-0|pg||
nt|panja: good or lucky? a very think line between the two.....@SJ and @ST are not what bidding unearths, yet, without them, there would be no slam|pg||
nt|harmon: not touch and go thats just blather|pg||
nt|panja: thin line...even|pg||
nt|hlortz: the challenge here was bidding not the play...|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s9|nt|stewball: suit pref @h 7|pg||

pc|s5|pc|s6|pg||

nt|bridge_one: however 7@h need @S 3/3 or 4/2 (down with 5/1 or 6/0)|pg||

mb|p|nt|mdgraham: EW 1NT 15-17, 9-12 at favourable vulnerability|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfb: Obviously he didn't really claim at trick 1, I had to go to the other room. Hopefully that match is fixed now|pg||

mb|p|nt|roswolf: yup it is good in that case -good inference spotted by the kibber|pg||
pc|s3|nt|kareno: 2@h shows spades, I suppose.|pg||
nt|panja: 3@S is the limit..|pg||
nt|mdgraham: EW play 2@s as 5-10, 6+@S, not as a two-suiter  |pg||
pc|s6|nt|rodal f: Force bid only I belive Karen.|pg||
nt|hlortz: wonder who had the seed this quarter cant imagine bessis fancied playing fantunes again|pg||

nt|hawe45:  But where is the GF-hand?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: don't think so, try to find out|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@S natural? ( I have two spades..)|pg||
nt|panja: this must be 4@H and 5 minor..|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: 4/5@H no 4@S inv.|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: is what Drijver wrote as explanation|pg||
nt|panja: y, that seems the appropriate one|pg||
nt|mdgraham: unusual to set up a game force with only 7 hcp opposite 15-17, but I guess AK109x is a good suit|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|sK|pc|h8|nt|kareno: Good stop.  |pg||
nt|h_karluk: 3@s alert is a complete joke|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Jansma provides "max, good @H-suit + shortness in ?"|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: so it's not a joke ?|pg||
pc|s7|nt|mdgraham: if this is invitational I must have an out-of-date CC for EW.|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: exactly same expl. now given by Brink|pg||
nt|hawe45:  In the good old days, brave men would invite (maybe) with this East-hand|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: they are constantly working on their system|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, this is jolly good, thinks South|pg||
nt|panja: but after all this complicated construct, all that they have managed to achieve is to play in a 43 fit at a rather high level|pg||
nt|dutcho: polish auction for EW|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.panoramio.com/photo/5213107  for a photo of the venue, the Onstein Castle, owned by Hans Melchers, an avid bridge fan. The castle is located in the eastern part of the ...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Netherlands, near Vorden|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Four pairs in each team. We have four of them at our visible tables (open and closed room) and another four at two "invisible" tables in order to give new operators some practise|pg||
nt|bridge_one: another way would be to use by South a different responce at 3@h - bidding directly over level of 4@H to give 4 cards raise and a control (sample 4NT = 4cards raise (Hxxx), no ace ...|pg||
nt|bridge_one: out (otherwise 5 in the Ace ) a 1+K out|pg||
pc|c5|nt|mdgraham: their 2@C is different: either 6+@C, 10-15, or 5+@S, 4+@c|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - with the suit 6-0 against them - good luck|pg||
nt|mdgraham: as a matter of doing the job, we download available CC s when we can - but as we have seen there, players do change systems and the CC's can get out-of-date.  |pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: sry I don't have an up-to-date one too|pg||
nt|stewball: a breather here...|pg||

nt|stewball: anyone know why we are not getting any comparables?|pg||

nt|h_karluk: if that's "good hand"..lol|pg||
nt|xenya: other room started with 19 and 20|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h3|nt|sharkey: Zimmermann originally seeded 16 (now 1); Strul originally 12 (5)|pg||
nt|sharkey: For seeding brackets http://www.acbl.org/nabc/brackets/2010/01/vanderbilt/|pg||
nt|kareno: Seems like Strul was underseeded.|pg||
nt|kareno: Zimmermann too|pg||
nt|rodal f: Non of them surpriced me. Some might remember Zimmerman in Rio.|pg||
nt|sharkey: hard to seed when you look at the start list|pg||
nt|harmon: they probably need to change the seeding with so many european players now coming to nationals|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Khven was just mucking around with 2@D - unfortunately, his opps turned nasty|pg||
pc|h7|nt|hlortz: yes the ACB|pg||
nt|hlortz: acbl seeding formula not good for foreign pairs always|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South possibly afraid of 3NT, and too happy with 3@H to double - still, if EW were going to bid 3NT they would have done |pg||
nt|bjacobs: Worst case - he is in -500 territory|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h6|nt|bjacobs: The defence might need to find a spade ruff - not too easy|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: that were my words not his|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|sharkey: On the two tables in this match the US players are not present|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|hA|nt|kareno: Yes, ACBL needs to account for some of the foreign teams which have had good results elsewhere.|pg||
nt|sharkey: Four world champiuons this table|pg||
nt|panja: the problem is how do you assess 'good results elsewhere'?|pg||
nt|panja: with a 5422 hand and just 7 HCP.....what is the % that 1nt is the best spot? Quite high, I would think!!|pg||
pc|c2|nt|hlortz: perhaps give weight to wbf rankings|pg||

nt|panja: there is enough data available, and mathematics is stronge enough to handle the issue if there is will|pg||

pc|dA|nt|kareno: That's fine, Rodal, but Jan is definitely a woman.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: If 2@H is weak, it's quite a good weak |pg||
nt|dutcho: down 2|pg||
nt|yuval10: quite naturally, 2@h can be made with some stronger-than-minimum hands with a poor suit|pg||
nt|bridge_one: conservative 2@S by South - finding a good raise probably he know north don't pass|pg||
pc|d5|pg||

nt|jcwla: N has a classic "death hand" - reasonably hopes for a couple of @C's but not to be - same 7-card fit but a level higher.  |pg||
nt|roswolf: a natural redouble would have produced an e/w heart contract so i suppose nothing really lost|pg||

nt|vugraphzgq: West is arguing "nice convention, @HA is no trick"|pg||
nt|jcwla: Nice underruff by Drijver at T10 -- give one, take three.|pg||
nt|yuval10: with AT9XXX ? not in my book :)|pg||
mb|1H|nt|h_karluk: matter of styles |pg||

mb|p|nt|sharkey: yes - 5@C good sac|pg||
mb|4H|nt|sharkey: What's Silla to do?|pg||
nt|panja: trump lead will work well against a @h contract..|pg||
nt|harmon: for who??|pg||
nt|sharkey: Silla is Saelensminde's nick name |pg||
nt|xenya: yes, but somehow i doubt they'll get there|pg||
nt|stewball: dbl here might get them there|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2Nt 3 cards fit (but in balanced hand, so no sgl)|pg||
mb|p|nt|harmon: not for the defense|pg||
nt|jcwla: "3@D I do."|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not sure about 2NT with six solid diamonds|pg||
nt|hawe45:  And a singleton - no slam now, I suppose|pg||
nt|jcwla: The equivalent of the LOL bids of "4NT I do" and "4NT I don't" -- meaning I do or don't mean it as Blackwood.|pg||
nt|panja: 7@h here?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  even 8 - @H are 3-3|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: natural i.e. 21-23 bal, 3@C asks distribution|pg||
nt|yuval10: N will be able to introduce the @c now|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfb: Yes, when they sat down and I said that Saelinsminde wouldn't fit in the BBO name box, one of them suggested I just do Silla :)|pg||
nt|chessmaste: West might have done better to bid spades at some point - even 2@S was possible - then the double fit comes to light|pg||
nt|hawe45:  OK with that range, they bid the slam for sure|pg||
nt|panja: that is, can make 13 tricks in @H....no expectation of it being bid though|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 7@H cold on 3-3 hearts - don't think they will bid that, though :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: Well, they have steered their way into a 4-3 @H fit once this set.|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Sjoert is counting steps on his fingers|pg||
nt|stewball: S hand will improve considerably|pg||
nt|dinos1: 4@c now?|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: this 2@H bid always has a certain 'I have @S too' message, else 2@H preempt would have been on|pg||
nt|stewball: every thing he has is working hard|pg||
pc|s6|nt|yuval10: N will probably compete here|pg||
nt|sharkey: this shud make|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4@D instead 4@h is correct, bec give at the partner the elements to know what make after a 4@S by S|pg||
pc|s7|nt|yuval10: Pass looks to me a bit weird....he knows EW has 8 cards fit in @s and he's non vulnerable|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: sry|pg||
nt|h_karluk: would you pick 3@c yuval?|pg||
nt|yuval10: ok....that's a bit better :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: and no DBL even, on @D lead it appears to be -2-vul|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i meant as S|pg||
nt|yuval10: quite tough.... if P has 2 @s's it's better to defend maybe|pg||
nt|stewball: ugh|pg||

nt|stewball: now S has easy 5@c imo|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|sharkey: Geir had a very difficult lead I think|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Boye hadn't turned the diamond ten upside down and laughingly did so, implying he had been holding Helge up, but not|pg||
nt|dinos1: X was t/o - short @h|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: sry|pg||
nt|bridge_one: stand leads (any use small from XX)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|hawe45:  On a @D-lead, 3 NT might make easily here|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: 2@H: usually without stopper in @D|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Perhaps Hans would care to suggest a route to 3NT?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No route - but that happens often...|pg||
nt|xenya: i'm about to change my verdict -- seems they are on their way to 5@C (at least?)|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|panja: when in doubt, lead a trump!|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: 3@D no 4M, 4+ @D|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: 3@H asks @D|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: 3@S = 4 (?)|pg||
nt|yuval10: even with the advertised 8 @c's support|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mdgraham: mind you, this is a bit of a perfect fit - reaching 6@D is by no means simple|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: he must have miscounted his fingers before bidding 3@S :-))|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ok ..let's study the hand. say 4/4 minors, they start with @d, so opener in 4th seat vs vul has obv 5@c/4@d - my vote is : ok to S's X, no to pass - i wld bid 3@c over 2@s in ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: competition|pg||
nt|yuval10: 8@c fir that is|pg||
nt|yuval10: *fit|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|jcwla: asks @D honors, not cards :)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mdgraham: although on a low diamond to the ten and jack, North plays clubs...West gets in and plays @D8 through.....East can switch to a heart for another diamond|pg||
nt|chessmaste: in 3@C declarer has no problems|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: he thinks he has ...|pg||

nt|bridge_one: like a mixed raise in @H like here|pg||

nt|dinos1: 6@c here|pg||
nt|stewball: cautious pass|pg||
nt|xenya: need an undo here|pg||
nt|dutcho: dont think he passed that|pg||

mb|p|nt|panja: most any lead will sell a trick here..|pg||
nt|panja: not a @S though|pg||
nt|chessmaste: There are 3 losers in 5@D, so they have to reach 3NT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: difficult now |pg||
nt|chessmaste: Very|pg||
nt|mdgraham: admirably direct|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: and Dubinin too :-)|pg||

nt|bjacobs: Safety?|pg||

nt|hawe45:  Forcing.,..?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But still no 9 tricks|pg||
nt|mdgraham: @H10 lead would be an easy set (East must get in with @CK) but a low heart is reasonable  |pg||

mb|3D|nt|vugraphzgq: sry I was disturbed|pg||
nt|xenya: np Marc|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: if it's 4+ m then perhaps he'll avoid it..but it's very likely for P to have 5-5 when he's red|pg||
nt|rnmalik: that is true|pg||
mb|3H|nt|sharkey: Are they convering in English at the table Jan?|pg||
nt|sharkey: conversing*|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Mostly in Norwegian, but that was English - don't know if it's the same word|pg||
nt|hawe45:  With a decent @H-suit in West, all @H-lead works|pg||
nt|dutcho: neither do I actually|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and obviousl that would be a two parter question : a) would you overcall with 2@h b) what would be your bid over NT opener's X|pg||
nt|dinos1: 5@h wd be exclusion blkw?|pg||
nt|xenya: they won't reach a @S contract if they don't agree the suit|pg||
nt|stewball: not sure how redbl helps pard here|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfb: They also call the cards in Norwegian, so I have to watch the dummy|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: South knows that North is limited by the non-strong 1@C opening  |pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: short break as the late lunch arrived and players make their choice from the rolls|pg||
nt|mdgraham: a bit unlucky, really. @HAKQ wasted|pg||
mb|p|nt|dutcho: this will be interesting|pg||
nt|bjacobs: In a way, the lower 2@H bid is more dangerous than the higher 2@S bid|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|sharkey: Dont have "nice" in Norwegian - or anything close...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: There is no word for nice in Norwegian|pg||
nt|Walddk4: :)|pg||
nt|hlortz: the truth comes out!|pg||
nt|panja: N playing for doubleton @CH with E|pg||
nt|jcwla: 9 more to Russia on 4 - where EW here played 3@H-2, S in the OR played 2@H-2.|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: all pairs rotate on the different teams for the selector wants to see how the different combinations score|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: So every round 'Nederland 1' plays against 'Rusland 1' but the teams may or may not contain the same players|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: W still thinking|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This layout was not a whole lot away from a re-opening double by West, passed by East, for a large number|pg||
nt|bridge_one: any pair use 2@S immediatly with North cards (limit 6 good cards) to take the advantage to know fast the strong of the hands in the line and leave space at opps to bid|pg||
nt|sharkey: thus 2@S slow way probably more constructive|pg||
nt|roswolf: well i do but then i am strange!:)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sharkey: yes there is Roland - may be not in Danish|pg||
pc|c2|nt|chessmaste: It looks odd, but given that South was a pased hand should North prefer 2NT to 3@D?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: egg and bacon for me please |pg||
nt|xenya: perhaps N is going to take command?|pg||
nt|dinos1: hard to get much from S who bid spades w/o AK|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|dutcho: both x and 3@C are possible rebids with west|pg||
pc|h4|nt|stewball: hm|pg||
nt|xenya: sounds mysterious  |pg||
pc|hK|pc|h6|nt|dburn:  well, North didnt have to bid on - he might conclude that South would not have @cA or @cK since he could have bid 3NT if so|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|rodal f: Those Danich:)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: on @H void is it not difficult|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: 'spade finesse, 1 or 2 down'|pg||
nt|dinos1: 5N - ask @cA or "choose slam"?|pg||
nt|xenya: not to S though|pg||
pc|d4|nt|hlortz: tho trusting a Dane's comment about Norwegians.. doubtful|pg||
nt|panja: the @D duck encouraged a losing @C finesse, it seems..|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: and similar Nederland 2 vs Rusland 2|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Now an endplay against West in the red suits|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - but for 1 down|pg||
nt|xenya: well done |pg||
nt|stewball: invitation to disaster unless its clear|pg||
nt|stewball: and perhaps it was to S|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: 5NT: "bid 7 with good club"|pg||
nt|dinos1: thk 5N was grand slam force|pg||
nt|dutcho: well they got to the top spot|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: N has shown strong with @C, 1st rnd ctrl @H, S showed @D ctrl and 5@D with 4@S|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|pc|dT|pg||
nt|yuval10: N would've done better to unblock the @d's|pg||

pc|s9|pc|sK|nt|yuval10: so his P can play @s|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Declarer will need to fall back on the club finesse|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Although I suppose he could also play for a club ruff, so cancel the above comment|pg||
nt|dutcho: he could just give a club right bill?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Oh, give up a club?  ... So declarer can do practically anything he likes, and make it?|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: discussion of the hand, but it's in Norwegian so I can't tell you anything, sorry|pg||
nt|dburn:  still, I suppose South might have had @dA, in which case 5@d might not be a lot worse than the spade finesse|pg||
nt|dutcho: I silent 2@S for NS?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: pretty end game |pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: likely to be a good score for EW, the competitive hands are the most important in such a level!|pg||
mb|1C|nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
mb|1H|nt|chessmaste: It was awkward to be sure|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 1NT would have been interesting and EW got into makeable contract|pg||
nt|dutcho: the 2@c makes life hard for NS|pg||
nt|dinos1: as 4@c|pg||
nt|bridge_one: East can bid 1Nt (bec used for 4M5m)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: can't (sry)|pg||
nt|sharkey: The Dutch didnt get to slam on Bd 3 so Russia have opened a 19-0 lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Hehehe Go on Roland and we start for full speed.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This hand demonstrates just how right it is to open 1NT as North|pg||
nt|h_karluk: quite suitable shape for 2@d/2@h F****ry convention with N's collection|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: 1NT makes; 2@S doesn't|pg||
nt|dutcho: I was wrong again:)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Maybe a heart lead to 1NT would prove me wrong as well|pg||
nt|dinos1: pushed them to overbid|pg||
mb|p|nt|dutcho: well good look by Gert-Jan Paulissen|pg||
nt|dutcho: yes and both north and south have their bid|pg||
nt|bridge_one: so 1Maj can be 4 cards if the hand is good (14+)|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would have doubled with the east hand in the circumstances|pg||
pc|c8|nt|panja: NS hold the balance of strength, however, since S has almost all, EW will come to more tricks than NS|pg||
nt|sharkey: agree |pg||
pc|cT|nt|sharkey: Much of the Norwegian language originates from Danish - in addition we have dialect Norwegian, "nynorsk"|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Untraditional 12-14 NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: sry no alert on 1NT, just 15-17 :-)|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: that's what their cc says|pg||
nt|yuval10: 4@s now|pg||
nt|bridge_one: with passed hand in my partner the bid of 1@h (giveng the lead) isn't bad|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Bas got the answer he wanted 2nd from 4 small|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|chessmaste: That looks to be a good lead|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Are you surprised at that lead?  |pg||
nt|dutcho: this lead also attacks the only direct entry to dummy|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Long day here - for East|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not usually recommended, leading from jack to four |pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: 4th best, 2nd from xxxx|pg||
nt|jcwla: This looks like 5-4 inv'l and Brink passes with a prime submin.|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Sjoert confirms 15-17 with a smile|pg||
nt|hawe45:  We still think, that West has promised 15-17?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  OK - then he must refuse the invit|pg||
nt|dinos1: 5@d now?|pg||
pc|c5|nt|mdgraham: then that is some upgrade|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Bachar Abouchanab|pg||
nt|dinos1: yes|pg||
pc|c2|nt|yuval10: S knows he has no ruffing value in @h contract but his partner has plenty in @s contract|pg||
pc|c7|nt|dutcho: well I would just lead my longest suit @D|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|doctorone: Good morning all :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: well that is true|pg||
pc|h3|nt|yuval10: a nice lead by W to begin with|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|sharkey: Helness opened light to get @D lead - may actually help Boye|pg||
nt|panja: S can get two possible entrie to Dummy to play @H, @SJ and @CQ..|pg||
nt|panja: W can deny him the @SJ entry by ducking @SQ..|pg||
nt|dutcho: hi Bachar|pg||
nt|yuval10: but with the favourable place of the A@c it looks likely that declarer will make|pg||
nt|h_karluk: west picked the way to ruff with his master trump|pg||
nt|xenya: just 1 down?|pg||
nt|dinos1: yeah|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h4|pg||
nt|chessmaste: They did not look for a major fit, so North preferred a heart to a diamond|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I would have played bak a @H in trick 2|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Seeing West unblock the @H Queen|pg||
nt|dburn:  not clear why South preferred a spade to a heart, though|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true |pg||
nt|hawe45:  Kill dummy|pg||
nt|sharkey: i see only 6 tricks here...|pg||
pc|dK|nt|bjacobs: Against 1NT passed out, it's quite a good idea to lead your stronger major, as a principle|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|dT|pg||
nt|bridge_one: K @d was played hoping to find A in @d in North|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pc|h7|nt|dutcho: well usually partner has several ways to bid if he has 1 or 2 majors|pg||
nt|bjacobs: East has 11 points - it's not surprising partner has passed |pg||
nt|bjacobs: So that argument tends to come more into play when opening leader is weak|pg||
nt|dutcho: that is true so maybe that is an indication why he found this|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|hK|nt|rodal f: And "nynorsk" was the norwegian language, but some danes tryed to press an other language at the norwegians. Learn to play scoccer danes:)|pg||
nt|dburn:  still, North is prepared to stick with his original idea|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Is that a new Tarantinio movie?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: sorry east|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like declarer has picked the wrong line|pg||
nt|rnmalik: and he has made it difficult for himself|pg||
nt|h_karluk: another spade to K|pg||
nt|h_karluk: than a @h to hand still not bad|pg||
nt|yuval10: @h return must be from a singelton, so E is a lot more likely to have @s length than W|pg||
pc|hA|nt|panja: did he duck @CJ?|pg||
pc|hT|nt|hawe45:  Come on declarer - your @D-trick...!|pg||
nt|dburn:  well, it is customary for declarer to wait for South|pg||
nt|mdgraham: who will probably discard a heart |pg||
nt|hawe45:  Sry - had not seen thT...|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|mdgraham: hmm|pg||
nt|mdgraham: still going down though|pg||
nt|hawe45:  The 5-card @S is unknown for South|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1@H made now|pg||
nt|bridge_one: @s blocked|pg||
nt|bridge_one: East know (after the auction) all hight cards location|pg||
pc|d6|nt|sharkey: So West will be endplayed|pg||
nt|yuval10: W did well not to jump, otherwise he's giving the contract away|pg||
nt|h_karluk: now @h switch a must|pg||
nt|yuval10: declarer might still hope for 3-2 @h and play K@s before @h|pg||
nt|rnmalik: he has no other option|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @s K then @h small a bonus|pg||
pc|d8|nt|rnmalik: -1|pg||
nt|yuval10: now E can choose how does he want this contract down...the stright way with 2 ruffs of @h or the longer way :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 2 ruufs better|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ruff, play a @c get 2nd @h ruff|pg||
nt|yuval10: perhaps better ruff if you're affraid of KQ@d in S|pg||
nt|yuval10: if declarer has the A@c it won't matter anyway|pg||
pc|d3|nt|dutcho: for us it is easy to see east has to play clubs|pg||
nt|doctorone: E may opt for a @d now, not willing to provide an entry for an eventula @s finesse|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: it was not in the played position and he took it back|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|s8|nt|Vugraphzfb: Yes, he ducked the club J and then won the next one|pg||
pc|s4|nt|sharkey: Nice|pg||
pc|s9|nt|hawe45:  I agree with Brink - is 1 NT then the hand is too good for 12-14|pg||
pc|sA|pg||

nt|bjacobs: Because of the strong suit?|pg||

mb|2C!|nt|yuval10: so another very good score for EW|pg||
mb|d|nt|harmon: they slowed down at the other table|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Possible + for NL here - 5 @D looks rather ambitious|pg||
nt|sharkey: sry I have to leave this exciting match |pg||
nt|bridge_one: @h for North, return @C for the K, @s by West and duke - Now @c discarding the loser @D, and final 2tricks in @s for declarer|pg||

nt|vugraphzgq: bye|pg||

nt|bridge_one: Dbl may be interest for majors with 5+4+|pg||
nt|roswolf: this could turn out well for e/w|pg||
mb|3D|nt|mdgraham: 1@C=16+unbalanced, or 18+balanced|pg||
nt|h_karluk: did i miscount?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: Kaplan/Rubens evaluated it to 13.5: http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=J75+AK+98+AT7653|pg||
nt|h_karluk: east doesn't have 12?|pg||
nt|yuval10: E didn't open his hand which is quite remarkable nowadays :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Instead of @S Ace had he played small @C he would have made it|pg||
nt|roswolf: dont like 3@D|pg||
mb|3N|nt|chessmaste: 3NT making looks good - in the other room South led the king of diamonds!|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Just what East wanted, the bidding at 4@C by the time it got back to him|pg||
nt|chessmaste: At least he won't go down in 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: 3@h - 4@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|doctorone: yes... I think for NT to be playable, you hope for some @s support anyhow|pg||
nt|dutcho: ReHi all, I lost connection|pg||
nt|h_karluk: true Rasid|pg||
mb|p|nt|doctorone: welc back :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This hand is going to play like a foot|pg||
pc|s4|nt|dburn:  he wasn't all that likely to go down in 3NT, but he may well go down in this|pg||
nt|bridge_one: me too don't like because leave too space and 5 cards arn't sufficient|pg||
nt|roswolf: north was pragmatic|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: I think S thought because of dbl pd could be weak with @D|pg||
pc|s3|nt|hawe45:  Only 3 loosers - but will that make 10 winners? I doubt it|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: 'do I need to have 10 cards in M or is 9 OK?'|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Blood round the corner|pg||
nt|panja: N has bid once too many times perhaps|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Was OK, if some of their bids had been PASS|pg||
nt|xenya: time for coffee|pg||
nt|dinos1: only  @d lead cd beat|pg||
nt|dinos1: rather impossible|pg||
pc|s7|nt|dutcho: very nice defense by EW on board 8.|pg||
nt|dutcho: Jansma picked the wrong major to bid|pg||
nt|yuval10: E figure out that 9 tricks are easier than 10.... a bit dangerous in this hand but might succeed|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i don't understand why not 2@d (after the dbl) - may be they use a convention about 2@D in this sequence|pg||
mc|10|nt|mdgraham: double by North surely shows spades - reckon 3@S by South here, and then over to West|pg||
nt|yuval10: 4@h would've gone down with @c lead so this might create a swing too|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Is there any chance for @S lead|pg||
nt|yuval10: no....but red suit lead will make it interesting|pg||
nt|yuval10: @c lead will give 9th trick right away|pg||

nt|h_karluk: a real gem|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, nice defence resulting in an overtrick or 2|pg||

nt|h_karluk: it all depends yr guess in @d suit|pg||

nt|dutcho: 1@H=spades|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|yuval10: don't think that NS will play more than a game here|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the advantage to use 3@D is preemptive vs East (leave the level two )|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1@H xfert (of course)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfb: Comment by Silla and laughter - I was thinking I wouldn't want to be playing rubber bridge against Helness this set, so maybae that's what he said|pg||
nt|bridge_one: to give @h would bid Dbl|pg||
mb|2H|nt|harmon: can he find sp lead??|pg||
nt|panja: B58, N finessed out of bidding|pg||
nt|yuval10: if they will it will surely be interesting|pg||
nt|h_karluk: cash @h A then play towards @d K and claim 12 tricks - we see, how about declarer :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: with 11 cards chances are for play of @HAce and @D are friendly and a 6|pg||
nt|xenya: what's 1@D? -- weak hand or hearts? |pg||
nt|xenya: hearts|pg||
nt|dinos1: @h|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: 4@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: sry 1@D is weak but could be nat and strong too|pg||
mb|2N|nt|bjacobs: Do they response 1@S with hearts?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@c like a drury|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: N could as well have 5 @H...as the present hand..|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Helness asking Silla something, I think about spot card leads|pg||
nt|mdgraham: suspect 1@S=transfer to 1NT|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mdgraham: ...or not....|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: it looks it is but Sjoert choose to pass (Bas saying 1@S could be 2@S)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: oh thanks for double|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: according to dummy GJP 1@D is lots of hands, mostly no other bid available (so certainly no @H)|pg||
mb|p|nt|dutcho: yes but 1@H with 4-4 major|pg||
nt|yuval10: the X by W "convince" N not to think about slam|pg||
nt|xenya: N must have thought that a double at any point would be too dangerous -- i tend to agree |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dutcho: so partner could bid 1@S showing 4@H|pg||
nt|doctorone: Then, S may well have found the @h lead|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that gives a chance to get 12 tricks|pg||
nt|roswolf: well a high risk contract|pg||
pc|c4|nt|bridge_one: interesting 3Nt finding the stop with Qx Jxx in @c - but K@D out is a bad notice (:|pg||
pc|c7|nt|bridge_one: perfect lead - keeping the communication with partner|pg||
pc|c8|nt|xenya: any bid i mean|pg||
pc|c9|pg||

pc|d2|nt|sharkey: Compared to the fireworks we had at the end of 3rd quarter this match definitely has quieted down|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|panja: but...if one consider the chance..for N to have 5 @H...EW each would have to have 22..whereas for 5@S..it could be 3-2..just A to five would do...I guess @S has a little better % ...|pg||
nt|panja: chance of success in IMPs|pg||
nt|harmon: oyyyyyyyy|pg||
nt|bridge_one: need play the finesse|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c5|nt|yuval10: is everybody play here 4@c as shortness? for me 2@s ( beginning of short trail bid ) following by 4@c over P's relay bid of 2NT will show void|pg||

nt|h_karluk: @d A marked|pg||

nt|yuval10: then 4@c is a suit, 5-5 at least, slamish|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true but 4@C-4@H by P and 5@C again void|pg||
nt|dutcho: yes north needed to play ace on diamonds when he was in for -3|pg||
nt|bridge_one: a game at 50% is a good game|pg||
nt|roswolf: 6@D looks a cool contract|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|rodal f: Some have a rule by leads WHEN majors have not been bidded. Play ure shorstest. |pg||
nt|panja: 12 tricks in @S for NS, it seems here..but only 11 in @D..|pg||
nt|doctorone: agree, Bill. Requires work though, and these guys are certainly up to it :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: but then you're in the 5-level...might be crucial if P has waisted points in @c|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think Birman played so - long years ago in Antalya, Belladonna was also there|pg||
mb|2D|an|FG|nt|xenya: anyway looks like a good score for Russia -- 3N can't be made on careful defence|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Have never tested that out.|pg||
nt|dutcho: it has his origin from the orange club which was designed to serve the entire dutch team. Nowadays Only Jansma and Paulissen play somethigng simular|pg||
nt|bridge_one: here the stregth of a 6430 !|pg||
mb|4S!|nt|panja: or not perhaps..11 in @S too|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Helness asking Brogeland how many somethings he had last hand - maybe spades|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I was going to comment: "what contract should North be thinking of when he picks up his hand?"|pg||
nt|dutcho: I like his choice of opening bid|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Yes P may not have KQJ of @S very essential for the contract|pg||
nt|yuval10: i'm quite assure Birman play 4@c here as a suit, as he was the one who teached m to play like that anyway :P|pg||
nt|h_karluk: mutiny there? :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: but off to the next hand and awkward bidding prob. W has now|pg||
nt|bridge_one: if bid 2@h probably 3Nt bu North ....|pg||
nt|bridge_one: GREAT !|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4@S giving void - no strong in points but strong in distribution is excellent choise|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but can be alsop exclusion blakw|pg||
nt|bridge_one: i prefere to use 4@S like splinter|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: no questions/answers yet, let's see what north bids|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: My answer was: "he should be thinking of 3NT"|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: expl. by S "to play"|pg||
nt|doctorone: I was thinking about N's choice here, and I like it :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And then he goes and bids it!|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Singleton kings are like a red rag to a bull.  You have visions of a low card being led from the ace, and you winning your king|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: N expl 1st and 2nd shows solid suit without outside stopper but 3rd is different|pg||
nt|xenya: not that any given defence is careful enough|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|roswolf: a void splinter is likely|pg||
mb|5C|nt|bridge_one: yes, i bet for splinter|pg||
nt|roswolf: RKCB hardly would help i think|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: now Sjoert wants explanation (before he decides to double or not?)|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: with the trump suit being diamonds less room to investigate|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the reason bec i think 4@s splinter is that South can't use exclusion blkw with minimum open|pg||
mb|6D|nt|h_karluk: adios to 9 cards @h fit|pg||
nt|yuval10: if X wasn't for penalty, then perhaps X and 3@h over 3@d....but i suspect they might play X here as penalty|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: note the 1Nt rebid, 2@C will be fourth suit, not enough @H for 2@H...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: laughing conversation on the NE side of the screen - no idea about what|pg||
nt|sharkey: 4@S everybody's choice?|pg||
nt|hlortz: 3 would do for me|pg||
nt|panja: no..4@D perhaps for me|pg||
nt|harmon: I wouldve bid 2s then 3s earlier|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sharkey: Helness, Silla and Helgemo play on the same team in the Norwegian 1. division|pg||
nt|panja: partner can decide whether to raise, bid 4@S or even Pass..?|pg||
nt|dinos1: -1|pg||
nt|roswolf: north takes control|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: 4@S void, 4NT blackwood, 5@C 1|pg||
pc|c4|nt|panja: to make 12 tricks..N must cash @DAK and ruff third @D...|pg||
nt|hlortz: he's more concerned with making sure of 10 :(|pg||
pc|c2|nt|bridge_one: but it is also true that 3@S was splinter the same (i use 3@s also with sgl and a strong open, instead 4@S weak points but void)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|bridge_one: well, ty Marc|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|harmon: thats wrong anyway|pg||
nt|xenya: not yet|pg||
nt|dinos1: if return @sJ - duck|pg||
nt|dinos1: then only @d shift beats|pg||
nt|bridge_one: March told 4@S splinter with void in not strong hand|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Marc is the operator, so know the explain at the table|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c3|pc|c6|nt|hlortz: but everything breaks so all will be well|pg||
nt|dinos1: duck|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||

nt|rnmalik: It was tough for E to DBL 1@S without @C and there he is playing a @C contract|pg||
pc|d4|nt|dinos1: uc? hard to sfift to @d's w/o @d signal|pg||

pc|d6|pg||
nt|panja: and a @D ruff will not hold decl to 11|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: Helness had the @d Q out but put it back and put hands behind head and thinking|pg||

nt|rnmalik: :) that is life|pg||
nt|h_karluk: yes sir :)|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|yuval10: normal bidding so far|pg||

pc|hA|nt|Vugraphzfb: Helness "Ah Ha"|pg||
nt|bridge_one: a competitive bid (easy for E/W being not vuln)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sharkey: I believe most of us wud lead @SQ....|pg||
nt|panja: from the bidding S knows that W is close to 15-17 Nt range...|pg||
nt|panja: and hasn't opened 1Nt....|pg||
nt|sharkey: N may try low @S for 2. @C ruff - S does not have stiff @S view opening lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Helness said something and I sort of leaned forward questioningly and he says "it ain't easy I tell them" :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: After the last chat in Norwegian I told them I couldn't do my job properly if they spoke in Norwegian, that you all expected me to tell you what was going on|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But in fact, they were in "bid accurately" mode|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 4@S a better contract|pg||

nt|rnmalik: But why the !J@D and not the Ace-education for me|pg||
nt|yuval10: going even|pg||
nt|yuval10: i think he persume that from KT9 (XX) they lead T ( or 9 )|pg||
nt|h_karluk: still believe vs vul fair enough to play aggressive|pg||
nt|yuval10: then if P led from K9XXX and no entries it's very good play|pg||
nt|h_karluk: true|pg||
nt|h_karluk: presumably that's intelligent|pg||
nt|rnmalik: In that case if declarer has AKQ@H there is no defence|pg||
pc|h7|nt|dutcho: well although it looks a bit strange to defend this undoubled I understand both north and south here|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|pc|d5|nt|yuval10: indeed, only time it will lose is when declarer has this holding in @d and AKQ@h, together with A@c|pg||
nt|h_karluk: imo this board most probably would not gain anything |pg||
nt|yuval10: but it sounds like too much....perhaps he'd have bid 3@d with such a holding|pg||

nt|dinos1: or 2@s for NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzgq: hence he passes?|pg||
mb|p|nt|dutcho: 2@S is conservative|pg||
nt|yuval10: which more than indicate E that he should pass|pg||
pc|c7|nt|vugraphzgq: a slow 2@S has the same message ?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i would also pass|pg||

nt|yuval10: he might miss a slam against KQXXXX @d with W, so i'm sure he'd not have pass in other circumstances|pg||
nt|dutcho: I see no reason to play anything else|pg||

pc|cJ|pg||
pc|cK|nt|h_karluk: i meant no need trying to pull something from that empty hat - i admit yuval's point indeed nice, however i cannot push in teams, in matchpoints 100% agree, seems i am too much ...|pg||

pc|c6|pc|s7|pc|h9|pc|d6|pg||

pc|s4|pc|sT|pc|sK|nt|xenya: on 10, where 1N by W went down 2 here, the Russians in the other reached 3 @D -- 4 off and 5 imps to the Dutch|pg||

mb|p|nt|h_karluk: from now on each trick very valuable for both sides, no luxury to omit or stretch any principle |pg||
nt|bridge_one: N/S make 4@s bec finese in @H and K in @C are good|pg||

mb|d|mb|p|nt|dutcho: this hand is a lot easier for us than for Jansma|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I suppose you play for a cross ruff here|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 2 diamonds tricks and 8 trumps on a cross ruff?  |pg||
nt|dutcho: North can discard his red cards on the clubs and the spades in hand are very small|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That is certainly what he's thinking about - how many hearts will he be able to ruff?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: An alternative is a double ruffing heart finesse|pg||
nt|dutcho: yes maybe double finesse in hearts?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: snap|pg||
nt|h_karluk: given layout you are correct|pg||
nt|h_karluk: problem to land there|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: difficult-agree|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzgq: it is possible to go wrong ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: west will be under a lot of ethical pressure|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|dinos1: how? no sqz here|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: sry, forget that|pg||

nt|xenya: on 12, the Russian E in OR somehow managed to make 4@S (no trump lead) -- 13 imps to Russia|pg||
pc|c2|nt|h_karluk: but say North opener, how they say, overbidding? ok then it's possible no matter vulnerability|pg||
nt|rnmalik: The biggest problem S has that he has no quick entry to his hand|pg||
pc|cK|nt|h_karluk: as twice passed hand transportation problem quite expected|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c9|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Perhaps cash the diamonds now, before the mice get at them|pg||

mb|1N|an|GF relay|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 6@S is a poor contract on a trump lead, but it will still make|pg||

mb|p|nt|sharkey: Looking at the boards to be played in OR find it hard to see how Strul will pick up 16 IMPs.  Final board coming up|pg||
nt|sharkey: 3@H by S|pg||
nt|sharkey: sry - too good|pg||
nt|sharkey: 4@H makes|pg||
nt|panja: 4 losers I would think..|pg||
nt|yuval10: 4@s is actually -2 in best def.|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|sharkey: no - may be too fast|pg||
nt|panja: it could make...now that E's points have been revealed..|pg||
nt|dutcho: east had a strong xx but it shows @H|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @d 2 lead? :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|dutcho: agressive 2@S bid by south|pg||
nt|h_karluk: or a trump lead?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: then switch to @h|pg||
nt|yuval10: both|pg||
nt|roswolf: slam looks a bit too much here|pg||
mb|2D|nt|bridge_one: but it is ON also with @s lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|dinos1: will stop in 1@s?|pg||
mb|3S|nt|sharkey: Silla will "raise"|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so 4@s deserves a double|pg||
nt|dutcho: if pualissen would pass NS would probably play 1@S|pg||
nt|dinos1: oh - E bid @s)|pg||
nt|dutcho: Paulissen|pg||
nt|bridge_one: because Ax in @d in East !|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed - but i think a tough hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: NS have messed up, if E had correct information dbl is certainly an alternative over 5@D isn't it?|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: 500 = big|pg||
nt|bridge_one: so declarer can play @D for the K, and after @d for small and Ace of East - after need only a ruff of  @D|pg||
mb|4H|nt|Vugraphzfb: Helness looking at the auction and laughing about it|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: the bit is with E|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Lots of points, no fit, not stopper|pg||
nt|bjacobs: bit of a dilemma|pg||
nt|bridge_one: tha slam was ON also finding A in @d with sgl @s (or witout @S lead)|pg||
nt|roswolf: north has an obvious cue bid but south might not wheel out RKCB since he may be unsafe at the 5 level|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4@h is a shirtness cue in this sequence|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Now South know K in @C usefull|pg||
nt|bridge_one: like K in @d|pg||
nt|roswolf: imo he should bid on but he has taken some conservative views today|pg||
nt|bridge_one: so must go to slam|pg||
nt|roswolf: good comments giorgio|pg||
mb|p|mb|5H|nt|sharkey: Went quietly...|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 3NT might just scrape home|pg||
nt|bjacobs: rather luckily|pg||
nt|yuval10: 4@h looks like making though|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: y...a dbl of 3@S is not unreasonable...chance of 500|pg||
nt|rnmalik: appears so|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: N mumbles something like sorry I am a little light|pg||
nt|h_karluk: groans and grimaces barred sir, scowling free :)|pg||
nt|dinos1: 2@h now|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 5@H is excellent|pg||
nt|bridge_one: means A in @h and second round control in both minors|pg||
mb|5S|nt|rodal f: Y|pg||
nt|sharkey: Helgemo's 3@S is not for the faint of heart|pg||
nt|panja: that is after the raise to 2@S..|pg||
nt|panja: I feel the raise in not warranted....E hand is too weak for that..|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: But Jansma is not prepared to parlay it ... so he makes the blame transfer bid|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Jansma just wants it to end!|pg||
nt|doctorone: This is getting awkward :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: he is looking like that|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think he has to prefer back to 4@H now|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Incredibly, even that horrible contract might make|pg||
nt|doctorone: Usually, my feeling here is: "Why is this just happening to me whenever I open such a hand?" :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Actually, I suppose repeated spade leads will ruin 4@H ... so it looks like E/W are heading for a minus, the question will be: how big a minus|pg||
nt|doctorone: I dont think he may make 4@h, Bill. The @s lead will cause control problems likely|pg||
nt|rnmalik: In the OR N bid 1NT and that disturbed the entire hand|pg||
nt|dinos1: X showed @s?|pg||
nt|xenya: was penalty based on the strength in spades|pg||
nt|rodal f: In my world U Serge.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Y|pg||
nt|xenya: didn't demand a @S lead specifically i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|bridge_one: otherwise would bid 5 in the minor|pg||
nt|roswolf: bd2 score now corrected|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: '4@H shows shortness and no @D control'|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm sudden stop|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|nt|vugraphzgq: @CAT are on the right side so he knew what he was doing :-)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: ty Marc - good information !|pg||
pc|d3|nt|sharkey: Vul I think raise ok Prakasj - @HK behind and nice side suit|pg||
nt|yuval10: 9 points but his X works out perfect here|pg||
nt|yuval10: 1NT was probably raptor|pg||
nt|yuval10: 4@h and a minor|pg||
nt|h_karluk: now south plays comfortably with his tricipital muscle , 1@s and x draws the big picture in his mind|pg||
nt|h_karluk: the board could be a breakpoint|pg||

nt|h_karluk: still affords|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he already knows picture from auction|pg||

pc|h3|pc|hK|pc|h2|pg||

nt|bridge_one: a return @S now can be a killer|pg||
pc|d2|nt|roswolf: very true|pg||
nt|bridge_one: this because the initial Dbl means streght|pg||

nt|h_karluk: 500 is the most dangerous number in today's bridge|pg||
nt|rnmalik: How?|pg||
nt|yuval10: next door there was a 2@s 5@s + 4(+) minor opening|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Operators can do whatever they like as far as I am concerned, as long as the operating is flawless. But if it's not ...|pg||

mb|3H|nt|yuval10: the X might help EW to bid game here if East invites|pg||

nt|h_karluk: that's simply 11 :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: may well play in @H|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|yuval10: XX by E = retransfer|pg||
mb|4D!|nt|bjacobs: South contents himself with 3@D, which will give him 8 imps, as it happens|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: in normal circumstances E would've probably bid 2NT but he hates doing it now with a singel @h|pg||
nt|h_karluk: the question<i know a matter of style> xx = good or bad|pg||
mb|4H!|nt|bridge_one: East is thinkong what bid - can choise 4@C cue or 4@H raise giving the distribution, or 3Nt giving both stop in the minors|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|dutcho: yes good enoguh|pg||

mb|p|nt|h_karluk: i meant if xx rexfer then what's 2@s|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4@H means control in @c (squeeze cue) - i don't know if means also control in @h|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm i still think they will go on|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4@s means stop with less of 2 key cards|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|doctorone: Given that N simply bid 2@h previous round, S did not consider any further action, reasonnably enough|pg||
nt|h_karluk: how much HCP alowed etc|pg||
nt|h_karluk: *allowed|pg||
nt|roswolf: no well judged|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: 3@H = 'kind of natural', 3NT = serious, 4@D cue, 4@H last train|pg||
pc|c7|nt|yuval10: declarer will simply duck 2@h's and will make his contract |pg||
nt|roswolf: thx marc|pg||
nt|bridge_one: however the slam is a little bit up 50%, not a great slam|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cJ|nt|rnmalik: playable contract|pg||
nt|h_karluk: quite reasonable|pg||
nt|yuval10: the 3-3 in both @c and @d surely helps|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @H position to be guessed|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Jansma asking about leads|pg||
nt|h_karluk: how about @s hook and K position|pg||
nt|h_karluk: can declarer afford to play @s A then @s J to preserve a tempo|pg||
