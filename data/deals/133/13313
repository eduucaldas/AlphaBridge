pc|c6|nt|panja: perhaps, a stronger invitation than 3@C might have been more apppropriate..but what that could be is difficult to judge|pg||

mb|4H!|mb|p|mb|4S!|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: The range is about right, but you rarely have 7½ tricks in your hand when you open 2NT|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: because you have no ideal rebid after 1@H from partner|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: 2@C asks for majors|pg||

nt|mdgraham: not sure about 2NT with six solid diamonds|pg||
nt|hawe45:  And a singleton - no slam now, I suppose|pg||
nt|jcwla: The equivalent of the LOL bids of "4NT I do" and "4NT I don't" -- meaning I do or don't mean it as Blackwood.|pg||
nt|panja: 7@h here?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  even 8 - @H are 3-3|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: natural i.e. 21-23 bal, 3@C asks distribution|pg||
mb|3H|nt|Vugraphzfb: Yes, when they sat down and I said that Saelinsminde wouldn't fit in the BBO name box, one of them suggested I just do Silla :)|pg||
nt|chessmaste: West might have done better to bid spades at some point - even 2@S was possible - then the double fit comes to light|pg||
nt|hawe45:  OK with that range, they bid the slam for sure|pg||
nt|panja: that is, can make 13 tricks in @H....no expectation of it being bid though|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 7@H cold on 3-3 hearts - don't think they will bid that, though :)|pg||
nt|jcwla: Well, they have steered their way into a 4-3 @H fit once this set.|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Sjoert is counting steps on his fingers|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: this 2@H bid always has a certain 'I have @S too' message, else 2@H preempt would have been on|pg||

nt|chessmaste: Perhaps Hans would care to suggest a route to 3NT?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No route - but that happens often...|pg||
mb|p|nt|panja: when in doubt, lead a trump!|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfb: discussion of the hand, but it's in Norwegian so I can't tell you anything, sorry|pg||
nt|dburn:  still, I suppose South might have had @dA, in which case 5@d might not be a lot worse than the spade finesse|pg||

mb|p|nt|rodal f: Hehehe Go on Roland and we start for full speed.|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|panja: NS hold the balance of strength, however, since S has almost all, EW will come to more tricks than NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Much of the Norwegian language originates from Danish - in addition we have dialect Norwegian, "nynorsk"|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Untraditional 12-14 NT|pg||

nt|panja: W can deny him the @SJ entry by ducking @SQ..|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d4|pg||
nt|chessmaste: They did not look for a major fit, so North preferred a heart to a diamond|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I would have played bak a @H in trick 2|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Seeing West unblock the @H Queen|pg||

pc|d9|nt|rodal f: And "nynorsk" was the norwegian language, but some danes tryed to press an other language at the norwegians. Learn to play scoccer danes:)|pg||
nt|dburn:  still, North is prepared to stick with his original idea|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Is that a new Tarantinio movie?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|panja: did he duck @CJ?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|hawe45:  Come on declarer - your @D-trick...!|pg||
nt|dburn:  well, it is customary for declarer to wait for South|pg||

nt|hawe45:  Possible + for NL here - 5 @D looks rather ambitious|pg||
mb|p!|an|5-7 HCP|nt|mdgraham: 1@C=16+unbalanced, or 18+balanced|pg||
mb|2D|nt|jcwla: Kaplan/Rubens evaluated it to 13.5: http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=J75+AK+98+AT7653|pg||
mb|2H|nt|chessmaste: 3NT making looks good - in the other room South led the king of diamonds!|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Just what East wanted, the bidding at 4@C by the time it got back to him|pg||
nt|chessmaste: At least he won't go down in 3NT|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|d|nt|dburn:  he wasn't all that likely to go down in 3NT, but he may well go down in this|pg||
mb|r|nt|hawe45:  Only 3 loosers - but will that make 10 winners? I doubt it|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: 'do I need to have 10 cards in M or is 9 OK?'|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Blood round the corner|pg||
nt|panja: N has bid once too many times perhaps|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Was OK, if some of their bids had been PASS|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: double by North surely shows spades - reckon 3@S by South here, and then over to West|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzgq: a rather quick pass|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but West can't double with his hand, surely, even after the redouble from East |pg||
pc|c4|pc|c6|nt|hlortz: 5@C would be in jeopardy if K@H in other hand|pg||
nt|rodal f: A new flatty by the nice @D layout? Or slamtry by 5@C as end?|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||

nt|jcwla: Thx Panja|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: bye|pg||
pc|h2|nt|Vugraphzfb: Helness explaining what Helgemo has shown to Silla, but in Norwegian - I think that 3@c promised clubs and was forcing to game, but that's just from the body language|pg||
nt|sharkey: As Henry mentioned they have "rightsided" the contract so shudnt be anything to the play|pg||
nt|panja: could W have rebid 3@H on 3@D to keep alive chances of playing in 3NT? or should E have rebid 3N instead of 3@D?|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hQ|nt|hawe45:  22 IMPÂ´s board 5 - when did we see that score...?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 6@Dx+1 at one table, 6@Sx+1 at the other|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Russia made a doubled slam +1 in both rooms|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Both doubling pairs lost an overtrick also|pg||
nt|mdgraham: cost an imp, that|pg||
nt|rnmalik: That was some hand to think of it|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Nice score in a 10-board-match|pg||
