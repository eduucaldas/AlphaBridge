nt|santyclz: I was so busy entering all that stuff I missed the name change.|pg||
nt|the saint: Could East have avoided it by pitching two clubs and keeping three hearts? Then he could have avoided the endplay|pg||
nt|chick: but then not get one of the clubs he got?|pg||

mb|p|nt|chick: Ah, Staffan, I am so sorry for even doubting you :)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|haans: standard is that it is a penalty double but who play standard|pg||

mb|p|mb|2D!|nt|haans: assume xx was minor + major|pg||

nt|bjeagle: Hi!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Our operator is Carl Ragnarsson|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Good evening again!|pg||
nt|vugraphzew: For newcomers... this is a HCP-based tournament...|pg||
nt|vugraphzew: ...so some words about the HCP-calculationEvery player has a national HCP (based on pairs tournament played in Sweden)...|pg||
nt|vugraphzew: ...The HCP of a team is calculated as the average of the four players involved in the actual segment...|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|daman: NS might have the momentum to get to the sketchy @S game|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|bjeagle: 1@c is 12-17 any|pg||
nt|vugraphzew: ...The HCP-difference between the two teams is multiplied by the number of boards played in the specific segment...|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C!|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|athene: hi again good evening everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzew: ...Depending on which players actually are playing, the HCP varies between these two teams...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.bridgefederation.se/filbyter_bridge/resultat/fc10/Hed-Andersson.pdf|pg||
nt|daman: Hello Bill|pg||
mb|3H|nt|Walddk2: 1NT 8-11 normally balanced|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bjeagle: 2@c is asking for majors|pg||
nt|daman: 3NT by South might have been OK|pg||
nt|daman: but it wasn't going to happen|pg||
pc|c4|nt|athene: it's hard for declarer to get a club away on a diamond even if a club isn't led at trick 1|pg||
nt|daman: yes     but a @C seems obvious|pg||
nt|athene: certainly four losers now and might be more|pg||
nt|ralfwil: the bidding made it easier for E to find the @c lead|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|c2|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hK|pc|h3|pc|h8|pg||
nt|athene: now two more rounds of clubs to attack dummy's trumps|pg||
nt|athene: declarer might choose to pitch the @D4 on the third club i suppose|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cT|pc|c7|pc|c8|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cJ|pc|cQ|nt|athene: but then east will surely just play the @DA|pg||

pc|h5|pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pc|h2|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|pc|sT|pc|sK|pg||
nt|athene: basically if dummy has a long suit which declarer is obviously trying to bring in, the first line of defence to consider is making dummy ruff, so declarer can't draw trumps ending ...|pg||
nt|athene: in dummy to cash the side suit|pg||
pc|c9|pc|s8|pc|h7|pc|d4|pg||
nt|athene: also there is the 4-1 trump split here which makes it good to just attack declarer's trumps anyway|pg||

nt|the saint: 6@D slam missed in the other room. Where our South decided to make a slam try over 17+ balanced, the other one decided his hand was ony good enough for 3NT|pg||

mb|p|nt|othered1: Finally thanks to my fellow commentators, Joe Shair and Bard Olav Aasan for their insights here.|pg||
nt|the saint: At the other table, North got both majors into the auction and South raised HEARTS|pg||
nt|santyclz: Stopping at 2nt and making 2 or 3 would lose the match by 1 imp, I believe.|pg||
