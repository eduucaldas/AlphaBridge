mb|2H|mb|d|mb|3H|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|greerm: Both pairs here are playing 2/1 GF which means strong No trump 15-17 and 5 card majors|pg||
mb|p|pc|hQ|nt|nigel_k:  Lucky lie of the cards for N/S means they can make 4@h and 4@s is down 2|pg||

nt|oleberg: Relay precision is known in most of the world as "Wiking club"|pg||
nt|oleberg: (Where it is known)|pg||
nt|jni33: Bjarnarson-Askgaard need to win with 16 imps to win the "tournament"|pg||
nt|oleberg: Both pairs play the 1@D opening as always unbalanced.|pg||
nt|patricck: 4@S makes here, and it is a reasonably good game, declarer would need oto be lucky in one of the black suits|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|an|15-17|nt|oleberg: Which was the dominating method among the top pairs in the European Championship a year or to back|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C|mb|1N|nt|bjacobs: at least on a double-dummy basis|pg||
mb|3C|nt|nigel_k:  Declarer will need to do some good guessing|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: On a club lead, there doesn't seem to be that much to it ... just hold up the clubs for a while and then play a spade to the king?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Or am I missing something?|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Winning the third club and leading a spade towards the king works|pg||
pc|c2|nt|greerm: place the mouse over the result at the other table to see the bidding there, quite different|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  If you duck the third club they can lead a heart and make you guess|pg||
pc|s2|pc|cA|pc|c4|pg||

nt|oleberg: A true yarl|pg||
nt|mikeirl: perhaps dbl by E over2h is best T/O|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: maybe but 2NT did show 15-17--|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: hi all|pg||
nt|patricck: yes, better for poker, at least he would have four nines :)|pg||
nt|chick: hi Marshall|pg||
nt|garnetts: an awkward hand for South to bid if North bids 1NT|pg||
nt|mikeirl: dbl is(11-14) :)|pg||
mb|1N|mb|3C|nt|Walddk2: A Yarborough is a hand with no card higher than a nine spot. The term is derived from Lord Yarborough of England, who offered a wager with odds of 1,000 pounds to one against the ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: chance of any player having such a holding. The actual chance of any player holding a hand with no card higher than a nine has been mathematically equated to 1,827 to 1|pg||
nt|garnetts: if you think 3@C is a good bid then start with it---not once the opps have got things together|pg||
mb|3D|nt|garnetts: 3@C is awful in my view --poor suit and defensive values|pg||
mb|p|nt|oleberg: And a killer in Chinese poker|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|oleberg: NS plays "Nilsland", so North's pass required redouble|pg||
pc|c7|pc|s2|nt|mikeirl: 3c  look  like winning  bid|pg||

pc|c9|nt|garnetts: In what was is it a winning bid?   |pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|nt|jni33: ohhh|pg||
nt|oleberg: Doing this, instead of bidding 2@S directly, tells the NT-opener, that he may compete to three, on a suitable hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Lars will hate this lead, but the contract is still down|pg||
nt|patricck: Still not good enough. Declarer can lose only one club, but when east comes in A@S and another leaves nowhere to put the 4th @D|pg||
nt|garnetts: Directed NS into a makeable contract |pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|patricck: *west|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  if you don't bid with E hand, what is the good hand after 1NT opps opening?|pg||
pc|cT|pc|h2|pc|c3|pc|cK|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d5|pc|dK|pc|d9|pg||
pc|d2|nt|oleberg: Quite a position from South, to bid 4@S|pg||
pc|d4|nt|oleberg: But being behind 16 against very competent opponents, it may be ok|pg||
nt|jni33: Maybe Lars liked the lead ... when he saw dummy he was very happy not being left in 3@h dbl |pg||
nt|patricck: Even if the bidding is invitational from North his hand is not that attractive|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
pc|d7|pc|h3|nt|Walddk2: At least East has one valuable card, @D9, the Curse of Scotland|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|sharkey: hi everyone|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|oleberg: No. But NS is also much into making a good system, so there may be something we dont know|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|s8|nt|patricck: good play, now West must play A@S @S or it might make|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Indeed|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But if anyone can work that out, Lars is the man|pg||
nt|oleberg: West might think declarer fears an overruff|pg||
nt|oleberg: But he is opening his communication for a crossruff|pg||
nt|patricck: West will fear that North's @D are Q9xx |pg||
nt|Walddk2: What can he do if they are?|pg||
nt|patricck: northing I guess, but maybe another @H might be right if partner has J@S|pg||
nt|oleberg: Lars knows that NS are very good, but also very gutsy. And ready to take a position, if they believe in it.|pg||
nt|jni33: Lars has the @h J in hand ... under the table ... noone else than Emil and I can see it|pg||
nt|jni33: "the little details" says Lars|pg||
nt|patricck: North really needs @S KQJxx for the bidding. playing partner to hold 9@D seems better odds than the J@S|pg||
nt|oleberg: not so obvious to me|pg||
nt|jni33: now @c A in hand|pg||
nt|oleberg: Even without the @SJ, the bids seem okay|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Small wishes come true more frequently than big ones|pg||
nt|patricck: Surely A@C can't be right? North bid out his shape|pg||
nt|oleberg: As far as I know, the sequence wasn't invitational|pg||
nt|patricck: South must have thought so because his hand was hardly a gem of a 1NT opener :)|pg||
nt|jni33: Lars asks a lot of questions to Michael|pg||
nt|jni33: "can N have 4@s and 5@d" he askes ... "I have newer seen it" is Michaels response|pg||
pc|s5|pc|c2|pg||
nt|jni33: @c A it is|pg||
pc|dT|pc|s4|nt|garnetts: has to play for the spade to be right now--and it is |pg||
pc|h5|pc|c5|pg||
pc|d8|pc|h4|pc|s7|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h6|nt|oleberg: It is suggested, that East would have played a high diamond on the heart, if he wanted an uppercut|pg||
nt|patricck: Indeed that would be good defence from East. West really should have got this right, but this is the last match of a stressful event :)|pg||
nt|jni33: And the first punch from NS seems to be a "success" ... Bjarnarson is thinking |pg||
nt|jni33: The "doors" in the screen is being closed|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c8|pc|hT|mc|8|nt|jni33: Gregers is talking to Jacob -- cant hear it here -- they are on the other side of the screen|pg||

mb|2D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: No one seems to be in the mood for a 1@H overcall with those North cards|pg||

pc|s9|pc|sA|pc|s6|pc|s4|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Secondary honours (Q and J) in opponent's suit are bad|pg||

nt|chick: probably the operator already starting to claim :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Emil could see that the 8 was big enough, so he played that. Well done :)|pg||
nt|patricck: Big start for NS, they almost certainly have the 16 imps they need from the 1st two boards, so the winner of the event is in the balance|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|oleberg: Slightly off-shape take-out double, but nescesary|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: He has compensating values; double is fine|pg||
nt|chick: I rarely get better shape than that for a takeout|pg||
nt|jni33: I'll try to keep you updated with results from the other three tables later|pg||
nt|patricck: South can diagnose that there is spade shortage opposite and his own spades are rubbish, so he should have bid 5@D|pg||
nt|oleberg: North knows that South has 5 diamonds or more, unless he is marmic|pg||
nt|chick: and non vul opposite vul makes it even more attractive|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|oleberg: I do not find it obvious that South should have bid 5@D. Other things than thrumphs may defeat games, abd partner may already have taken a position|pg||
nt|patricck: Quite right for North to pass, he doesn't want to sacrifice if South has 4 chunky spades. South is the one who can see how bad his spades are|pg||
nt|oleberg: But surely 5@D would be tempting|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|garnetts: There a a few players that would bid 1@H on the North tickets--anyone for that?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  playing for @s ace by E - looks good|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: EW have "stolen" North's suits so she'll be happy to defend|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sT|pc|sJ|pc|sK|pg||

pc|d3|pc|d2|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dT|pc|d5|pc|s6|pg||

pc|s4|pc|s2|pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||

pc|c6|pg||
nt|jni33: It seems that Board 2 is going to be a loss for Bjarnarson-Askgaard ... two other tables have now played board 2 ... one table 1@h RD making 7 .. other table 4@s DBL making 10|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|pc|hT|nt|oleberg: 1@H RD 7 must be EW?|pg||

pc|sK|pc|s5|pc|s3|pc|s6|pg||
nt|sharkey: this due to the game bonus of 500|pg||

nt|sharkey: Shudnt W Dbl?|pg||
nt|mikeirl: yes, very difficult|pg||
nt|garnetts: only three spades and minimum values makes double very dodgy |pg||
nt|sharkey: Not perfect - but too good to pass?|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|oleberg: Bjarnarson has a trick up his sleeve again.|pg||
nt|jni33: Board 11: Two tables have played this board ... at both tables E played 3@s ... making 8 tricks at one table and 9 at the other table|pg||
nt|sharkey: Shows that preempts make it difficult|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dT|pg||
nt|mikeirl: i would be shy to bid|pg||
pc|dK|nt|oleberg: 2@H = Usp = A good raise to 2@S|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d8|pc|h3|pg||
nt|chick: so an opportunity for a good result (one way or the other) here|pg||
nt|garnetts: You need a personal policy here--either you always double or you always pass--more to be said for double if you are vunerable more to gain then|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|pc|hK|pc|h5|pg||
nt|garnetts: must play a club now |pg||
nt|mikeirl: C?|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cA|nt|sharkey: what makes this game so interesting...:)|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|pg||
nt|oleberg: A thrumph lead could have forced declarer to guess|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hA|pc|h6|nt|oleberg: But it would have been the heart finesse|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|s5|nt|oleberg: As a club loser can go away on the ace, even if the finesse loses|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s3|nt|oleberg: And there is really not any reasonable alternative|pg||

nt|garnetts: as predicted a 10 imp loss on the last board |pg||

mb|2D|mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  I guess so|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: It isn't, but Double = "1 suit" according to their card|pg||
mb|p|pc|hK|nt|bjacobs: This will be very tricky if East finds @S10 switch at trick 2|pg||

pc|h3|pc|h4|pc|h5|pg||

mb|p|nt|sharkey: 3 NT by N here?|pg||
mb|1D|mb|2H|nt|oleberg: Bjarnarson ponders.|pg||
nt|sharkey: NS play weak NT I presume|pg||
mb|d|nt|jni33: Board 12 has been played twice so far .... E 4@s making 10 tricks at both tables|pg||
mb|p|nt|oleberg: He either has to upgrade two point, for a 1@C opening|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|oleberg: or make a 2@C call that doesn't do the hand justice|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|hK|nt|patricck: This might have been a more interesting board with colours reversed|pg||
nt|sharkey: Has to work for 9 tricks I think|pg||
nt|garnetts: There is some contention as to whether 2NT here should show 15-17 if playing a weak no-trump|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|pc|h5|pg||
nt|garnetts: Some experts argue that you may need to bid 2NT with say xx KJxx AKJxx  xx|pg||
pc|c6|nt|patricck: N/S vul there is no incentive for NS to push to 5 of a minor|pg||
nt|sharkey: Think it shud David show 15-17 - Dbl of 2@H shows more points than Dbl of 1@H|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|pc|c4|pg||
nt|oleberg: Double dummy, 5@D is only one off, but..|pg||
nt|mikeirl: needed @S switch|pg||

pc|d8|pc|h9|pc|c2|pc|s3|pg||
nt|garnetts: This is an onging debate with the proponents of the weak notrump--but many have given up the 12-14 notrump anyway|pg||

pc|cJ|pc|hT|pc|s6|pc|s4|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|hJ|pg||

nt|mikeirl: tks all|pg||
nt|sharkey: ty all|pg||
nt|garnetts: I am not sure if it is a good diea or not--prefer to suggest it may be possible using say 3@C as a sort of checkback |pg||
