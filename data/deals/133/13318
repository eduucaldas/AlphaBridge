nt|rodal f: Hi Nye:)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Richman-Klinger a resuming partnership, with a few rusty bit|pg||

mb|p|mb|2H|an|!|nt|mrnye: since the count is known in the suit, the trick 1 card should be suit preference|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rodal f: 21HP against 19HP. The partscoore belonge to EW this time.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 2@H is 4+4+ both majors , 12 hcp|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: <12|pg||
mb|3C|nt|mrnye: it is safer for richman to balance here given he is a passed hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrnye: if he was not a passed hand, he would be taking a big risk in acting since his partner might take him serious and raise to game|pg||
nt|rodal f: Rich came|pg||
nt|mrnye: whereas here he will likely buy the hand in 3@C which is the best spot|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: that makes 7 tricks|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d7|pc|d4|nt|mrnye: the KQ of @C are good cards - I guess klinger is hoping to get a trick from the lead and for his partner to have Axxxxx clubs and an ace|pg||
