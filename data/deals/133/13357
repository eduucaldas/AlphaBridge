mc|9|nt|jcwla: Reasonable of course but I think 4@C is a little rich - 15 only w/o @CQ and overvalues shortness before it is known to be useful.   Still, can think of  perfectos that would not ...|pg||

mb|2D|nt|mwigor: 6@h by anderson fairly good|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mrnye: I suspect 3S showed a minimum with 4 spades so it wouldn't make sense to lie and bid 3NT at that stage - certainly east could have offered 3NT over 3S though|pg||

mb|1N|mb|2D|mb|d|nt|jcwla: Buchen/Christie play DONT over strong NT - so @D and an unknown major.|pg||
mb|3D|mb|d|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|mwigor: missing a pass operator|pg||
nt|jcwla: A great convention for those who like to bid over opps' NT (which should be everyone) -- lets you get in on lots of hands and make your opponents' auctions less peaceful.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|dQ|pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|d3|pg||
nt|mrnye: I disagree - i think it's a poor convention because it emphasises minors instead of majors - you end up showing a minor and an undisclosed major when it really should be the other ...|pg||

pc|sT|pc|s5|pc|s7|pc|h3|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c6|pc|c2|pc|c8|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c3|pc|c5|pc|c9|pg||
nt|mrnye: yep or some variant of cappelletti|pg||
nt|mwigor: that has the disadvantage of either giving up on some 54s or losing definition|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sA|pc|s8|pc|h5|pg||
nt|mwigor: although nothing is perfect|pg||
nt|mwigor: certainly jordan's main point is correct - its important to get in over their NT particularly at these colours (nil vul)|pg||
nt|jcwla: Prefer Astro to Capp as with Capp the minor with your major has to be reasonable enough to go to 3 level --> more occasions to hold back.|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|nt|mwigor: the only other score on this board so far is 300 for EW so smolanko anderson pick up an IMP or so so far|pg||

mb|3D|nt|mrnye: 6D looks like the best slam but very hard to get to|pg||
mb|p|nt|mwigor: yes|pg||
nt|mrnye: sort of impossible not to get to slam after the 1NT opener|pg||
nt|jcwla: Yup and it's not a bit shaded.|pg||
nt|patricck: even 6@D doesn't make if the defence starts with a @S|pg||
nt|mrnye: can smolanko find the 4D bid here? it's probably the only way to get there|pg||
nt|mrnye: I don't think he will feel confident enough that 3D shows a good 5 card suit though so I'm backing them to get to 6C or 6NT down one as well|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|mwigor: what if declarer guesses to play a @h to the Q and pitch two @h on the @s?|pg||
nt|mrnye: I'd be surprised if anyone found 6D|pg||
nt|mwigor: (in response to patrick)|pg||
nt|patricck: Yes, thats true... was only thinking of setting up @C|pg||
nt|jcwla: Maybe @H first, then 4@D over 3NT.|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|mwigor: that not a bad auction jordan|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|mwigor: presumably suggesting something like this|pg||
mb|5C|nt|mwigor: otherwise raise @d immediately|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrnye: they may well stop below slam if they can work out they're missing QC and AH via keycard - only possible if you play some minorwood though or you'll be too high|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrnye: well done|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrnye: this should be a big pickup for anderson/smolanko|pg||
pc|sT|nt|mrnye: so with their 4S game on the last hand I'd say they're favourites to take the 3rd spot if the rest of the match is flat|pg||
nt|mwigor: perhaps 4@c was RKCB in @c|pg||
nt|mrnye: it seems likely since 4H couldn't be a cue|pg||
