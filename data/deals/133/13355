nt|bjacobs: Hello|pg||
nt|mrdct: interesting hand first up|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: g'day all I  hope the internet does not go down and I can catch every bid, nuance and card|pg||
nt|mrdct: maybe a 4@h opening by north|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: 4NT from West?|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|nt|mrdct: yep|pg||
mb|d|mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: And a nice double from North saying: "I have an interesting hand"|pg||
nt|mrdct: 6@C look sto have chances but bad trump break makes it problematic as need to ruff a couple of @D|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|bjacobs: After this gets knocked off, he'll be sweating in 5|pg||
pc|sK|pc|c4|pc|s8|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mrdct: a trump switch by north when he wins the @DA will beat 5@C|pg||
pc|h5|nt|bjacobs: There are easier ways|pg||
pc|c9|pc|h2|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s4|nt|mrdct: also the @H ruff of course so this contract is definately going down|pg||
