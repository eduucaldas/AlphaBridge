pc|d4|pc|d5|pc|s6|pc|d6|pg||

nt|haans: if u have that possibility|pg||
nt|haans: most have not|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lestergold: ht switch now followed by spade and the roof caves in|pg||
nt|haans: but tranfer bids give opps more bidding room|pg||
nt|lestergold: this contract is so frankly sillyh that it is barely worth commenting in the play|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  I should have some way to preempt: if not a direct 3@h then 2@d followed by 3@h|pg||
nt|haans: or direct 2@H |pg||
nt|lestergold: the damage could be 14 imps|pg||
nt|haans: North to bid or die|pg||
pc|hT|nt|henryb:  Playing strong NT it is less necessary to have preemptive responses in your arsenal|pg||

nt|chick: NS have the majority of points, but very poor choice of suits/strain|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|chick: EW only 19 HCP and flatish, but at least they have a playable suit |pg||
nt|chick: in any case, game is too high for either side I think|pg||
nt|rodal f: As NS have at 3NT with a @H lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|chick: we shall see if S can pull this off :)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|rodal f: There I agree by u totaly.|pg||

nt|vugraphzgn: S asked something from W and is thinking now|pg||
nt|rodal f: But Smight want to go for it and get some exsta bonus -:)|pg||
nt|chick: there are actually ways to make this ... finessing club for 6 clubs, then spade finesse (now just knock out the K later), and playing the @H10 when hearts are led|pg||

nt|lestergold: how do you manage to play in 3n missing club guards hen there is an easy 4@s avaialable/|pg||
nt|lestergold: looking at closed room auction, 3N was doubled giving them a chance to escape but they didnt!!|pg||
nt|henryb:  In the other room North overcalled 1@h, got an enterprising raise to 3@h from South, and West decided to protect his @hAQ by bidding 3N|pg||

nt|henryb:  and surely when he sees the @dJ fall he will take his three diamonds and not risk South having the @hA|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|nt|haans: very true but most of us do not play italian style opening bids forcing|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: u are right henry i think we are both right! I am saying taht at this stage round one of the bidding , I do not usually find it pays to sell out to  one level suit contract|pg||
mb|d|mb|r|nt|lestergold: but i agree that most players tend to make one bid too many|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|lestergold: frequentl;y taht is |pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|haans: bergen say do not give them 2@S either|pg||
nt|lestergold: and here is an example!|pg||
pc|c2|nt|lestergold: East should pass 3@c more chance of beating 3@c tghan making 3@s|pg||

pc|h5|pc|h8|pc|hK|pc|h3|pg||
nt|henryb:  Or double?|pg||
nt|lestergold: east with 4 trumps and two forcing suits the majors should want to defend|pg||
nt|haans: question is what did xx mean |pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|pc|s3|nt|haans: for me asking p to bid 3 or pass|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|lestergold: i ti9nk re doubnle says that he was on the good side of his raise to 2@s and had a few cards|pg||
nt|lestergold: that was reasonble but 3@s was a poor decision ewspwxially when hisn patner is unlikelt to have a great suit|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dJ|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pc|s4|nt|henryb:  I think it suggests good defense, and I think West with only five spades and AKK on the side might (should) have considered doubling 3@c|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sJ|pc|cQ|nt|lestergold: well I think the double was clearcut at mps|pg||

nt|lestergold: maybe a kluttkle aggressive when doubling into game at imps but either way west says  i heard you redouble and i want todefnd 3@c|pg||
nt|haans: agree there|pg||
nt|lestergold: east had no reason to countermand that every reason to go with that view|pg||
