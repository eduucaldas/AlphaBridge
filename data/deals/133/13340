nt|vasmar: a part score for E_W here|pg||
nt|vasmar: probably 1NT|pg||
nt|atabey: giorgos always playin 1 trick up. this one he cant do anything :) just 1@s and pas|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: talking about first trick|pg||
nt|atabey: 1NT by w for sure|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|vugraphzge: lastt boards, tks all|pg||
nt|vasmar: especially after 1@C opening south cannot balance in clubs|pg||
mb|1S|nt|jfaria: but i doubt they will get close|pg||
nt|rabbi: Luckish Slamish :)  At another table: 4@H E 12 @D4 = -480|pg||
nt|nuno_paz: 4@H...depending on QS guess...another guess...well 4@S has to guess right..|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|atabey: in these days 1@c is almost always 3 or 2 cards. he could balance|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h3|pc|h8|nt|eleni: The 2nd segment will start in 1 minute after the last table finishes|pg||
nt|vasmar: the seventh trick after the lead|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|rabbi: and @h behaving... one can win 12 tricks in NT, @S, and @h|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|nt|jfaria: Think acacio will play safe|pg||
nt|rodal f: By board 7 and 8 I've seen better bidding from NS here then at OR|pg||
nt|rodal f: Still 7 gave 2IMP away.|pg||
pc|h4|nt|jfaria: 2 rounds of @s...|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|vasmar: a club swich now in order to embarass declarer|pg||

pc|dT|nt|vasmar: now he must insert J|pg||
nt|atabey: thats very reasonable. how many tricks now?|pg||
nt|vasmar: 8 at least|pg||
nt|vasmar: on a diamond continuation 9|pg||

pc|h7|pc|hA|nt|atabey: well played. no blame to N. he cant imagine the @c position|pg||
mc|8|nt|vasmar: the fact is that declarer cannot count 4 spade tricks from the beginning|pg||
nt|atabey: agree|pg||
