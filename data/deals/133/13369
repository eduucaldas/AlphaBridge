nt|Walddk4: You have created a broadcast of your own|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ritong: two vulnerable game swings is an important gap|pg||
nt|hlortz: NS play sort of Kaplan-Sheinwold weak NT non vul 5cd majors and EW are a pretty tradional French pair father-son M Bessis being the father|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|hlortz: hello all. we are back i see|pg||
nt|chick: Hello Everyone :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: welcome to finals of this long event (barring overtime)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|daman: and away we go|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ritong: hi there|pg||
nt|hlortz: note Martel opens 1@C not 1N playing weak NT|pg||
mb|4S|nt|othered1: somehow, Levin avoided the 1@H overcall and chose stay out.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|daman: Mutton|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: operator, who is the bessis with spectacles?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but doing this allowed opponents to compete more easily, which often happens|pg||
nt|ritong: well, the opening bid was 1 NT|pg||
pc|c6|nt|Vugraphzfe: father michel|pg||
nt|hlortz: 1@H lead director :)|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cT|nt|ritong: yes, but east or west:)|pg||
nt|ritong: thanks|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|daman: lucky to find pd with xx in @S    but he had few options|pg||
nt|barnets: e/w appear to have a lucky 3N with spades breaking 3-3|pg||
nt|chick: lucky also to get a 3-3 split|pg||
nt|ritong: an overcall remains possible, of course|pg||
nt|othered1: true|pg||
nt|ritong: but sporty|pg||
nt|fabsayc: nothing wrong with heart lead :)|pg||
nt|hlortz: yes and Martel trapped into the 4@S overbid.... |pg||
nt|othered1: Strong NT can be preemptive, too.|pg||
nt|ritong: certainly so  4@h looks cold, at first sight|pg||
nt|hlortz: yes need the @D ruff to hold it to 4@H so the preemptive strong NT strikes|pg||
nt|fabsayc: as they said when Versace did it, it was the heart seven that made suit good enough|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sybarra2: hello all and welcome back to Reno |pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|nt|daman: EW played in 2@D on the 4-2 in the OR|pg||
nt|dinos1: 3-3 or Ax under|pg||
nt|daman: the pass of 2@D seems flawed|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|ritong: so, a no swing board|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cK|pc|c4|nt|hlortz: westart with a routine 3N - just a matter of overtricks|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|h7|pc|h6|pc|h4|pg||

nt|ritong: only one ruff|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no heart underlead|pg||

nt|hlortz: 9 IMPs to Zimmermann tightens up the match|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|ritong: i might try to guess with their bidding style, but this is dangerous:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|merijng: slam on finesse|pg||
mb|1H|nt|othered1: A solid start, taking advantage of the opponents' methods|pg||
nt|star6ija: hello everybody|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|dinos1: wrong red K|pg||
nt|ritong: thank you  you have two thomas on screen, actually|pg||
mb|3H|nt|barnets: south pased in both rooms wisely|pg||
nt|barnets: and in open ew are trying for slam|pg||
nt|ritong: odds are thay will pay it back, with 15 boards left|pg||
nt|star6ija: a good board to start with|pg||
mb|4C|nt|barnets: in open south after passing came in with a 2@H bid |pg||
nt|ritong: but unsure:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: writing I think it says single suit but I can't really see that far|pg||
nt|fabsayc: passed hand balance seat double can be minor one suiter, even if that is not normal meaning|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: ouch|pg||
nt|othered1: west may feel obligated to get his @H into the auction.  But it's not without risk.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: martel may pass|pg||
nt|hlortz: martel tempted to pass?|pg||
nt|ritong: certainly so|pg||
nt|othered1: and lead @D?|pg||
nt|star6ija: 6@c are cold for NS|pg||
mb|4H!|mb|p|nt|janm: Double is normally a 4 card Major and a longer minor, but I think that the balancing double can also be a diamond 1-suiter|pg||
mb|5C|nt|barnets: e/w did very well to stop in 5@S in open|pg||
nt|merijng: stopped in 5 in the other room|pg||
nt|ritong: do they play weak 2 in @ds, jan?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: opening, that is|pg||
nt|ritong: probably not, since lew has a pure hand for it|pg||
nt|janm: No, 2@d is Flannery|pg||
nt|star6ija: also 6@ss but it's lucky|pg||
mb|6C|nt|barnets: west keycarded found partner with 1|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: should be fine now|pg||
nt|ritong: ahum|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: maybe the play with go faster than this afternoon|pg||
nt|ritong: okay, we have an other possible tip  the one who looks older?|pg||
nt|chick: another routine 4@H, probably flat|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: michel|pg||
nt|hlortz: another flat game... at least no room for commentators to make errors - yet :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: they might have too much momentum in this room|pg||
nt|ritong: lol  ok, forget it:)|pg||
nt|ritong: ok  thanks|pg||
mb|p|nt|dinos1: @c cue - @h cue - 4N  -5@s|pg||
nt|barnets: and decided not to bank on the @D finesse|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/  for BBO-TV. Watch the play in both rooms at the same time, even while playing or in the lobby. Open one browser window per table|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: writing at both side of the table|pg||
nt|daman: do we all agree with the 4@H bid by East?|pg||
nt|janm: And although they might sometimes open 3@d with a hand like Lew's, not in second seat vul :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: i understand:)|pg||
nt|star6ija: after free bid 4@c it was impossible to end in 5@C|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sA|pc|s7|nt|barnets: no|pg||
nt|daman: same here|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|ritong: so if tom brings this home, the gap will be divided by two  an affair|pg||
pc|cA|nt|hlortz: surely henri you know their styles well enough soon u will tell us who is pere et fils|pg||
nt|ritong: yers, but if i err, i will be in trouble:)|pg||
nt|hlortz: thats the idea!|pg||
nt|ritong: eheheh|pg||
nt|ritong: til now, the two auctions were automatic|pg||
nt|chick: I have it on good authority that Michel is the father and he is sitting east|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, michel is the father, no doubt about it|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ritong: all right now  thank you operator|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: fingers can only type so fast and follow the play|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: :)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|chick: depends on what 4@C was|pg||
nt|barnets: but slam is 50 percent|pg||
nt|chick: alerted, it could have been an asking bid|pg||
nt|barnets: which is ok|pg||
nt|dinos1: what's wrong with 4@h?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: cards really favorable for declaer, can make 3|pg||
nt|othered1: Looks like another methods swing.|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Good Morning everyone|pg||
pc|cK|nt|dinos1: exchange @d-@h in W's hand|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ritong: hi|pg||
mc|12|nt|daman: 11 to Fleisher now     a new leader|pg||
nt|merijng: Was 4H cuebid?|pg||
nt|daman: I think you need to be able to see a source of tricks     and East cannot see that really|pg||
nt|barnets: 22 imps on the position of the @DK|pg||
nt|dinos1: cue-bidding doesnt show extras. it shows location of controls|pg||
nt|daman: he is fortunate West had such a great hand|pg||
nt|barnets: the other room|pg||
nt|dinos1: E hand is limited but not W who sees source of tricks|pg||
nt|barnets: weinstein must have been dissuded from bidding slam by helgemos overcall|pg||

mb|p|nt|daman: y'all|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|d|mb|p|nt|daman: a strong NT auction on the horizon|pg||
mb|1S|nt|hlortz: we are treated to a modern non vul preempt|pg||
nt|ritong: the aggressive preempt will not produce a clash|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: chip martel avoided the debatable 1 NT overcall|pg||
nt|othered1: The Frenchy always have 4 trumps to raise at once|pg||
nt|othered1: French, rather|pg||
nt|ritong: :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|nt|daman: will South invite with a square 8 points?   yep|pg||
nt|warrens:  would everyone invite with South's hand non-vul?|pg||
nt|barnets: so n/s are playing weak nt here|pg||
nt|barnets: and norths rebid is 15-17|pg||
nt|fabsayc: swatted away with ease|pg||
mb|2D|nt|daman: Hi Warren|pg||
nt|dinos1: I wdnt|pg||
nt|hlortz: yet another routine game.|pg||
nt|ritong: michel will start with the @s J|pg||
nt|ritong: just in case, sometimes north holds K10x|pg||
nt|hlortz: in order to pick up K10x onside |pg||
nt|hlortz: u type faster|pg||
nt|ritong: and i am not that used to comprehensive colleagues who rebound, i ll take it into account:)|pg||
nt|chick: N is trying to decide which of him many suits to signal for |pg||
nt|ritong: probably a puppet to 2@d|pg||
nt|star6ija: N is normal choice|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: i think he also tries to sdend a message  "please do not play from dummy that fast on first trick"|pg||
nt|ritong: tor helness got a bit more enterprising and paid 300|pg||
nt|hlortz: so probably 5 IMPs will go back on this hand... |pg||
nt|ritong: 150 is 4:)|pg||
nt|hlortz: u think they will make FIVE @D ??|pg||
mb|p|nt|dinos1: 4333 and lone @hJ|pg||
nt|ritong: but it will be at least 170|pg||
nt|ritong: no.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a nt-contract is rather easy with almost every card on side|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, that was more or less my point|pg||
nt|hlortz: ah yes i missed the :) my bad|pg||
nt|ritong: oh, no problem|pg||
nt|star6ija: 1 NT is*|pg||
pc|sT|nt|barnets: well helgemo did|pg||
nt|warrens:  I wouldn't either, but both tables did and they're in the Vandy final:)|pg||
nt|barnets: in the other room playing 15-17|pg||
nt|daman: I have too many scars to invite with hands like that    |pg||
nt|dinos1: @c lead - down from the start|pg||
nt|daman: they will prevail   I would have lost IMPs|pg||
nt|barnets: maybe thats why these guys are in the final|pg||
nt|dinos1: also - 17pc PLUS golden @h10. Isnt it too much|pg||
nt|star6ija: 2@D is the best decision, wd Tenev|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|star6ija: 130 on the horizon|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s4|pg||
nt|ritong: trying to sneak an entry  not today|pg||
nt|ralfwil: in fact easier than a @d contract|pg||
pc|d2|nt|fabsayc: good lead but thomas not biting|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dK|nt|hlortz: think he will cash A@S going to dummy w A@D and finessing risks K10 of @S and dbltn @D in south|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, his @c manoeuvre puts him in jeopardy|pg||
nt|hlortz: tho since he ruffed Q@S that loses to K10x onside hmm|pg||

pc|dA|pc|dQ|nt|ritong: all will end well|pg||

nt|barnets: yes|pg||
nt|star6ija: 1N is easy to be defeated, let us see what will come from the OR|pg||
nt|star6ija: the machine is going slightly mad|pg||
mb|p|nt|fabsayc: had he overruffed thomas should play to pin the nine, only winning combination|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|ritong: woof|pg||
nt|star6ija: 3@C?|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|star6ija: aha modified Bergen perhaps|pg||

mb|4S|mb|5C|nt|gambit: got to 3S in the other room - just in - tough to stop |pg||
nt|hlortz: yes 6@C is always there i think but 6N was a bit lucky to escape a @H lead|pg||
nt|othered1: Why 2@S?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|barnets: and a spec with a sense of humour wants to know if it costs 10$|pg||
nt|dinos1: I knew pair who used 5-4-3-2-1 honor count|pg||
nt|merijng: boring boards until now, except the slam on finesse but thats just 50/50 so oke to bid or stay out|pg||
nt|ritong: south might cue twice|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2d rebid is any minimum i believe|pg||
nt|othered1: ty|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@D seems obvious now to me|pg||
mb|d|nt|barnets: not really |pg||
mb|p|nt|gambit: does S raise 2@s to 3? I think so |pg||
nt|hlortz: yes that 9@S in west is a big card |pg||
nt|ritong: and with a six bagger, north should cooperate|pg||
nt|ritong: til now, he has promised three @ss, and he has six|pg||
nt|gambit: and a dearth of values beyond spade 5/6 |pg||
nt|ritong: superb decision by martel|pg||
nt|othered1: buit there's still that misfit |pg||
nt|hlortz: well the @C raise may salvage a near push  great bid at least on this hand :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: both sides could have made 3N|pg||
nt|warrens:  is 4@D now kickback?|pg||
nt|ritong: they probably will lose 2 imps, but have avoided the worst so far|pg||
nt|othered1: so 4N is?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: diamond cue presumably|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: wow super well done|pg||

nt|ralfwil: I don´t like 4nt with a void in partners suit, but perhaps another meaning than asking for aces?|pg||
pc|cK|nt|barnets: it is one of te biggest tournaments around and we have a 3 imps margin|pg||

mb|1H|mb|d|nt|janm: With one round to go in the Women's Swiss, these are the standings (rosters in today's bulletin): 1 Zur Campanille 81  2 Hampton 74  3 Bjerkan 70  4 Burger 60  5 D'Ovidio 67  6 ...|pg||
nt|janm: Baker 55|pg||
nt|ritong: but there is one stiff jack and three small singletons, so i think correct play is jack hook|pg||
nt|star6ija: more about the fit conventions|pg||
nt|star6ija: will they have enough courage to reach 4@h|pg||
nt|bigtrain: 4@H appears a trick light|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|barnets: 12 tricks seem an awful lot here|pg||
mb|2S|nt|bigtrain: looks like 9 tricks are the maximum|pg||
mb|3H|nt|merijng: yeah helness ducked the heart lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|bigtrain: the light opening and competitive 3@H bid will likely propel then to game|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|star6ija: time to sacrifice|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|bigtrain: yes...  10 tricks can be made - a bit lucky though|pg||
pc|c2|nt|hlortz: but with 2 entries to dummy if low to the Q fetch all small then cross to dummy to lead another....yes? that picks up KJxx for 1 loser also|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfe: now looking at convention card|pg||

nt|bigtrain: there are 3 things that can happen when you save and two of them are bad|pg||
pc|h2|nt|barnets: always a reason|pg||
nt|barnets: lets say he plays @S @SK and south has 4|pg||
nt|barnets: @SAK|pg||
nt|dinos1: @sA and no H appear?|pg||
nt|barnets: so maybe he should play @SK and finesse|pg||
nt|dinos1: why K and fin and not A and fin? N is more dangerous hand|pg||
nt|barnets: now he could go down with clubs 6-1|pg||
nt|daman: and @Ss 5-0     or 4-2|pg||

mb|p|nt|barnets: hi victor|pg||
nt|ritong: delicate position|pg||
nt|ritong: 4@h/@s could be cold|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but you need to act i think|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfe: ? leads|pg||
mb|4H|nt|bigtrain: although west's bid looks like a normal strong NT overcall east's makes it look like it shows a long minor with @H|pg||
nt|vugraphb1: exactly:)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|henryb:  I think Fleisher will just concede a spade and take his seven. He could go down if the spade is off and he uses the @dA to get to dunny|pg||
nt|ritong: nine tricks, likely|pg||
mb|p|nt|hlortz: notice if declarer gets to dummy he will start with 9@S to be able to repeat the finesse but yes he will likely just concede  a @S|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think 7 tricks are likely|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he still had diamonds stopped|pg||
mb|p|nt|dinos1: cd esily be 6@c if @c were NAT|pg||
nt|ralfwil: that @dQ didn´t hurt:)|pg||
mb|d|nt|odysseus69: hi Cornelia|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Multon its the system ?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: barnet -Jack says hi|pg||
nt|barnets: so dec can see if hearts split 4-3 and the try spades before going to @C finesse|pg||
nt|barnets: so dec has three strings to his bow|pg||
nt|daman: how many strings on a bow?|pg||
nt|daman: I never took violin|pg||
nt|daman: or fiddle for that matter|pg||
nt|barnets: and that gives him a very high percentage|pg||
nt|dinos1: check @hAKQ 1st,if not - play 3r of @s, then @c fin|pg||
nt|barnets: @DK @HAKQ if no brea@SA@SK|pg||
nt|barnets: should win @DK in hand|pg||
nt|barnets: to keep late entry in dummy|pg||
nt|dinos1: yes - to have ability to fin @c finally|pg||
nt|barnets: this looks like a textbook hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|odysseus69: 1600 kibitzers have all chosen their line|pg||
nt|bigtrain: oops...  n/s went from a small plus to a large minus|pg||
nt|star6ija: 1N shows either 4card major with 5+minor, or 18-20 balanced|pg||
pc|hK|nt|fabsayc: so no risk in winning ace for spade hook|pg||
nt|bigtrain: i'll assume i don't have to make the same statement about saving again  :)|pg||
nt|star6ija: yes 300 minus against 100 plus|pg||

mb|2H|nt|othered1: that was quite a 2@S bid in OR, even if constructive.|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: Declarer can guarantee his contract by drawing trumps eliminating diamonds and running the @C to east|pg||
nt|odysseus69: do we know about 3S?|pg||

mb|4S|nt|bigtrain: percentage play in hearts is the king|pg||
mb|p|nt|star6ija: 6@c was unbeatable because opps had singleton Ace versus Kxx in @Hs|pg||

nt|ralfwil: a @s shift from N|pg||
nt|othered1: just look at the difference in evaluations of the east hand.|pg||
nt|kareno: At IMPs I prefer Bessis' evaluation|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: and if he shifts to a @s, HH will score two swings of 4/3 partial in a row|pg||
pc|d4|nt|star6ija: it's very interesting position in @Hs|pg||
pc|dK|nt|Vugraphzfe: lots of writing|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d7|pg||
nt|henryb:  a careful play, the @h5. From TD's perspective, partner might hold Q32|pg||
nt|ritong: and a trump|pg||
nt|othered1: It may be a function of what's a minimum opening, but still . . . |pg||
nt|hlortz: lew learned from the last hand overtake and play trump|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|kareno: It's still IMPs and looking at the east hand you have to think there will be a play for game in spades or hearts.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Losing Trick Count rarely steers yu wrong. iN followed by 3S would be conservative. 2S is reactionary|pg||

nt|barnets: north and south both came down to 2 clubs|pg||
nt|barnets: and no spades|pg||
nt|barnets: and levein still had a @D stop|pg||
nt|barnets: sorry weinstein was playing it|pg||
nt|barnets: and could have made it|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: seceret weapon in clubs. the other weapon was better|pg||

pc|d6|pc|dT|nt|ralfwil: for...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes though fall of D nine would have made him relax very soon anyway|pg||
nt|fabsayc: on a spade lead, he would have to duck first club and stansby misguess|pg||
nt|othered1: amight east's failure to double 3@S have influenced the lead?|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|dinos1: yes- makeable if guess @c position|pg||
nt|ritong: i do not think so|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|s8|nt|odysseus69: deep finesse has no problem|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|marlowepi: W knows that E would always expect a spade lead|pg||
nt|ritong: doubling low level cues rarely is a good idea|pg||
nt|othered1: From west's perspective, south may well have better @D that run, so looking to beat 3N quickly isn't irrational.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, N did neg X|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ritong: on the other hand, either east has a @s honor and that establishes five quick tricks, or he hasn t and probably can offer some opposition in the other suits|pg||
nt|ritong: but, clearly, thomas went for the fast kill|pg||
nt|hlortz: back to that wierd 3N thomas made,, it was *very* hard for stansby/martel to visualize 10x for declarer's spase stopper so maybe that was the key to the strange result|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it was hard to visualize that on W bidding, but even harder to visualize the A on N bidding|pg||

nt|ritong: about 3/5 or 4th best prolly|pg||
nt|barnets: the score is 50-12 so far this set|pg||
nt|ritong: as an aside, french players prefer support doubles with structured hands, so pass does not deny three cards|pg||
nt|ritong: just shows minimum and uninteresting hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: very sensible too|pg||
nt|ritong: structured= extras or good shape|pg||
nt|dinos1: dcl has to duck @s now|pg||

nt|barnets: therehave been 4 large swings in this set|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfe: for those of you asking|pg||

pc|dA|nt|star6ija: Marashev*|pg||
