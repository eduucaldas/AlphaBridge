nt|simonr: Not sure why North is looking for a ruff with those trumps. Would have though a trump lead stands out to stop ruffs in dummy|pg||
nt|idc: Our operator will just be trying to catch up - so entered the final contract directly|pg||
nt|simonr: Scotland playing this hand in both rooms - 3@h by North making in the Closed Room|pg||
nt|idc: The 4-1 trump split makes this tricky, but clubs 3-3 gives declarer a chance|pg||
mc|8|nt|Walddk2: That was 5 IMPs more to Scotland. Current score: 0-16|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2  9  5|pg||
nt|miketedd: I think board 2 will have been 10 Imps|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No, declarer mad enough overtricks to lose only 9 IMPs|pg||

nt|simonr: So do I - that's why I stopped playing Acol years ago|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2NT|pg||
nt|idc: In a strong NT system, I used to play 1@d - 2@c, 2@d could be this 4-4-4-1 shape|pg||
nt|idc: solved some problems, created others|pg||
nt|simonr: Nothing is perfect on this hand shape|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The trouble with 1@H is that diamonds will disappear after 1@H  2@C|pg||
nt|miketedd: Not if you rebid 2@C|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You can't rebid 2@D without showing 5 hearts|pg||
nt|miketedd: 2@D|pg||
nt|idc: some prefer to pass minimum 4-4-4-1 shapes - I have some sympathy with that|pg||
nt|simonr: Back to the hand now - 4@h is a make|pg||

nt|idc: I once did a bridge column during an election (1997 I think), full off puns like those|pg||
nt|simonr: Interesting the different actions by West. In this room a value bid showing 15-17 doesn't shut up North whilst a simple 2@d overcall in the other room does.|pg||
nt|miketedd: West has to play @Ds and wants to put his partner in to lead a trump.  Needs a hard-to-find underlead|pg||

nt|Walddk2: I have summoned Michael Clark to get the missing scores in MOVIE. Hope it helps|pg||

nt|simonr: Not that it would be my choice at Red|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Walddk2: Indeed it may, and I prefer 1@H to 1@S|pg||
nt|idc: and opposite a passed hand, something to be said for 1@h|pg||
