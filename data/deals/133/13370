nt|xenya: hardly obvious though |pg||

nt|vugraphzgn: results at http://www.bridge.ee/MV/abkoos10.htm|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: and our first board is 3N|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 1nt with 5@H is usually a good idea|pg||
nt|mcphee: good hand here for 4 suit tranfers|pg||
nt|mcphee: the N player can show @C and then indicate shortness to arrive at the best game|pg||
mb|p|nt|eleni: This first session (10 boards) is between the teams Veloni-Virvidakis. They both were 5th in their groups|pg||
nt|petrosa: sthing wrong|pg||
nt|haans: not many open 1nt with 18|pg||
nt|hawe45:  What is Est woprth, I agree aith 15-17 - 4-3-3-3 and no intermediates|pg||

nt|vugraphzgn: http://www.bridge.ee/MV/abkoos10.htm here are the systems :)|pg||
nt|haans: i do not Aces and KINGs only|pg||
nt|chick: do, but I would downgrade for 2 reasons ... 1. 4333  and  2. very poor texture/intermediates|pg||
nt|haans: different opinions But who is right? one deal do not give the answer|pg||
nt|haans: 1000 deals do not give ...|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Part of the answer is, that playing NT our judgment is very good, perhaps not for a suit-contract|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h3|pc|hA|pg||
pc|c7|nt|mcphee: apparently they do not have 4 suit transfers available|pg||
nt|lelos: twra mallon 6@d|pg||

nt|haans: :)|pg||
pc|cK|nt|eleni: Team on E-W Levi are 1st at the moment on group B, while N-S Sapounakis are 2nd in group B|pg||

nt|eleni: Stavros Bobolakis, a great player|pg||
nt|petrosa: 3NT in the open room|pg||
pc|h7|nt|Gerben42: all roads lead to 3NT,|pg||
nt|MolvaM: maybe he was planning to find a 4-3 @s fit|pg||
nt|cicus: X is penalties for me, they may have different agreement|pg||
pc|hK|nt|haans: agree|pg||
nt|chick: yes, that will help a lot|pg||
pc|h5|nt|zoh:  5@c gia na bgoyn prepei na paixei to K@c apo to mort|pg||
nt|MolvaM: after a 2@s response, 4@s would probably a better final spot|pg||
nt|mcphee: i would not allow the @H bid to deter me from leading my 5 card suit|pg||
nt|eleni: This first session (10 boards) is between the teams Panagaki-Virvidakis. They both were 4th and 5th in their groups|pg||

pc|h2|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Oh - to avoid the @S-play from N|pg||

pc|s2|pg||

pc|cJ|pg||
nt|bmkl: favorable spade layout will make iit easy|pg||
nt|haans: did not 1nt say no hearts|pg||

mb|p|nt|henryb:  I take it you think what East deserved was some extra overtricks. And a less than best opening lead and subsequent defense, as it is hard to see where the 10th trick came from|pg||

nt|rodal f: Hi all. Will try to do my best.|pg||
nt|eleni: Good start for the team drom Thessaloniki|pg||
nt|eleni: Same contract, same score:) a tight match this will be|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|an| |nt|eleni: 16 teams play in 2 groups, in round robin system "snake". Each session is a 10 boards one (3 today) with a break of 1o' in between)|pg||
nt|eleni: Judy Levi's team is leading in Group A, sorry for the typing|pg||
nt|haans: assume  Ekrens both majors weakish|pg||
mb|p|nt|lelos: now 4 or 5?|pg||
nt|lelos: sintiritiko to mparaz mallon|pg||
nt|eleni: welcome Rodal|pg||
nt|eleni: Welcome back again Ladies and Gentlemen in the last round for today. Teams 1 (Altinis) and 2 (Roussos). Team 2 plays to win Argyrou Team (3rd) and enter the final 4|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: Hello again:)|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|eleni: BYE|pg||
nt|eleni: If you want to watch the other table, at the same time, pls go to http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/ |pg||
nt|cicus: I am surprised at seeing no 3@C preempt from west|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: I would prefer a 1NT overcall from north here|pg||
nt|Gerben42: with only 2@H, dbl is ok I think|pg||
mb|1H|nt|haans: stop at 2@S?|pg||
mb|p|nt|eleni: The Ladies Mrs.Panagaki and Mrs.Syrakopoulou may lose their @h fit:(|pg||
nt|spyrosm: 5@D= but Fillpos have everything need to balance|pg||
nt|bmkl: hi everyone|pg||
nt|eleni: against Lucas Zotos and Aris Sapounakis (asapou)|pg||
nt|haans: prempt in 3rd u mean?|pg||
nt|cicus: N would have been in an awkward situation|pg||
mb|1S|nt|cicus: yes|pg||
nt|hawe45:  At 3 maybe|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: now will play 3@C|pg||
nt|zoh:  2@s?|pg||
nt|mcphee: well 1NT is a choice but with only 2@H dble is much more comfortable|pg||
nt|MolvaM: the problem is, now south will overrate his 7 hcp. |pg||
nt|eleni: on BBO, North is ddiony and South nickd, West is vasso, East doest play on BBO:)|pg||
nt|eleni: Results at the moment are: Levi 88 - Hliapas 91 and Zeis 92.|pg||
nt|haans: support double = show 3 spades|pg||
nt|cicus: coming back with 2@C seems rather purposeless to me|pg||
mb|2C|nt|petrosa: -1  with logical play|pg||
mb|p|nt|bmkl: 2nd half of the Greek Open teams semifinal|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ghionis: 1st swing here i think|pg||
nt|haans: NS not happy|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: 1@D = weak|pg||
mb|3H|nt|mcphee: i like this 2@S choice from S|pg||
nt|mcphee: it could easily outscore a minor partial, |pg||
nt|zoh:  duck the King|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: must make since 2@H does not|pg||
nt|eleni: Lucas' name on BBO is zentel|pg||
nt|cicus: hmm, this game is rather thin|pg||
nt|haans: 1@H may have been 4 @H|pg||
nt|haans: 4 hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: So I have the shiny lady Eline who is 5 years older than me. 17Y 408M. There u are specs:)|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|cicus: in fact I would have bid an immediate 2@H instead of 1@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: yes, 1H was 4 hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: but 2C was 5 clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|eleni: lucky hand for N-S, in the Open Room they made it|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mcphee: although I am not fond of reasponding a 3 card suit in these positions|pg||
nt|haans: not Big Clubs at its best|pg||
pc|d4|nt|eleni: nice bid from George Loussis|pg||
nt|zlatan: accident...|pg||
nt|eleni: still 5@s can make|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|pg||
nt|zoh:  Tora atoy|pg||
nt|Gerben42: now draw some trumps|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mcphee: need to get the trumps going quickly if any hope to survive|pg||
nt|chick: be fair, not an easy hand for any system|pg||
nt|haans: easy in natural 1@H p p p|pg||
pc|hA|nt|Gerben42: then continue @D|pg||
nt|jcone: hello   everybody|pg||
nt|eleni: Good morning Jimmy, welcome, have some coffee:)|pg||
nt|jcone: tu tu   |pg||
nt|bmkl: Sapounakis -team from Athens- is leading Levi -team from Thessaloniki -|pg||
nt|zlatan: and 6@h is a good contract as the cards lie :)|pg||
nt|cicus: can't see this making|pg||
pc|h9|nt|eleni: yes Frank, and I play at least 5 more years than you are:):) as I play since I was 9 years old:)|pg||
nt|eleni: right:)|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|cA|nt|lelos: trying to give @h count cost a trick|pg||
nt|jcone: pleasure|pg||
pc|c5|nt|haans: nope|pg||
pc|c9|nt|haans: did right in @H but 2 @H losers|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c8|nt|cicus: to have avoided a double was a minor success itself|pg||
pc|h7|nt|chick: or 1@H P 2@S (weak jump shift) P P P|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|d8|nt|petrosa: ooops|pg||
pc|d9|nt|eleni: same contract in the open table, slightly different bidding|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|eleni: they all play udca|pg||
nt|mcphee: continue trumps and @D after the 109 appeared|pg||
nt|Gerben42: safe for 8 tricks now|pg||
nt|eleni: what a poor contract poor George was left to play:)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|cicus: E was in mercifuly mood|pg||
pc|s2|pc|h4|pg||
nt|Gerben42: even better would have been @HK |pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dJ|nt|piret0: http://www.bridge.ee/MV/VK10/VK10.htm is the results page |pg||
pc|d2|nt|spyrosm: so 1 more Imp for Altinis|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|bmkl: at least he made it|pg||
nt|eleni: yes:) nice end play|pg||
nt|bmkl: Manolas will make it if he guesses @cs right|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|hawe45:  Perhaps, but most systems would end up in 4 @S,  having chances|pg||
pc|c6|nt|haans: do not like that wjs |pg||
pc|s5|pc|cK|pg||
pc|dT|nt|piret0: chamionship is held during three weekends; 3 x round robin of 8 teams in A-league|pg||
pc|h6|nt|chick: I think the problem here was more that 1@H didn't show 5, then N could pass more comfortably|pg||
pc|d7|nt|piret0: this is the last, final week |pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|zoh:  3@s eykola|pg||
nt|eleni: very nice 3@s|pg||
nt|mcphee: W erred not cashing his winner in @C and now an over trick|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|zoh:  giati i Dysi exase ti Q1c|pg||
nt|zoh:  Q@C|pg||
nt|Gerben42: how many boards per round?|pg||
nt|mcphee: i suppose if the S hand wanted to be a bit wild they could dble 2@H responsive|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: 3 board per round, 8 rounds 24 boards|pg||
nt|mcphee: but that action seems very risky|pg||
pc|s3|nt|piret0: updated results will be posted on home page after each round |pg||

nt|piret0: today we will braodcast all 8 teams; tomorrow will focus on leaders only|pg||
nt|piret0: Starmen had a bad 2nd round; 1st was great|pg||
nt|haans: is 2@D an opening?|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Thanks for the update, Piret|pg||
nt|cicus: starmen has 2 vp's more|pg||
nt|cicus: 221-219 I gather|pg||
nt|haans: yep u rite|pg||
nt|cicus: a strong weak 2 or a light opener|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Impossible - PASS with that hand. ThatÂ´s like giving the opponent the service in tennis|pg||

nt|haans: mostly used as splinter|pg||

mb|p|nt|cicus: now the task is to apply the brakes in time|pg||
nt|haans: 4@H better game this time|pg||

nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|haans: rersponder usually have 8-12 hcp|pg||
mb|4D!|nt|mcphee: lots of tricks in @S |pg||
nt|eleni: 16 teams play in this round robin and just 8 of them will be forwarded to the last round|pg||
nt|eleni: Yet he plays against experienced players:) George Roussos and Manos Hatzidakis (mathat on BBO)|pg||
nt|haans: slamming now????????????????????|pg||
nt|haans: the less the less often|pg||
mb|p|nt|zlatan: n guess :)|pg||
nt|haans: south to have opps honors so no slam|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Better write a book about WJS - this is board 3|pg||
mb|4N|nt|Gerben42: 2@C is a tricky bid, now S will think his hand is worse than it is|pg||
nt|Gerben42: playing 2/1 I guess 1NT followed by 4@S is better|pg||
nt|mcphee: well that could lead to a missed slam|pg||
nt|zoh:  To 2@s einai forcing game|pg||

nt|lelos: hard to find @d lead also|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: stop at5 4@S|pg||
nt|chick: the main reason hearts play better is the bad spade split ... EW cannot discover that in the auction|pg||
mb|6C|nt|eleni: a most aggressive bid:) at the other table, E-W are simply at 2NT|pg||
nt|eleni: the lead was also a @h|pg||
nt|eleni: John is thinking very long and he is right|pg||
nt|droopy17: gia 1 kato|pg||
nt|eleni: On the final contest 4 teams will plau on knock outs for qualification of 1/2/3/4 places|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Tasos:) and welcome|pg||
nt|bmkl: easy game despite duplicate values in @cs|pg||
nt|ghionis: nikos (a very friendly person) always enjoy the game as he does the same with his life|pg||
nt|eleni: unless if we have a surprise:)|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: frankly i see not reason for S to not bid 3@H ater 2@S|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 2@C will lead to missed slam more often opposite @C shortness|pg||
nt|zoh:  Logika i antam einai @d|pg||
mb|p|nt|eleni: same contract in the open room:)|pg||
nt|ghionis: he has never read at least one bridge book but he is excellant card player (and poker too)|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: there is chance to make this|pg||
nt|haans: assume 4@D was kcb|pg||
nt|hawe45:  North will feel bad, when he sees dumnmy|pg||

nt|lelos: Hi Frank :)|pg||
nt|eleni: Same contract in the open room|pg||
nt|petrosa: I would open the N hand: 2NT|pg||
nt|haans: and what did 4@D really mean?|pg||
nt|haans: clibs honor + @HK at south can not be a suprise|pg||
nt|haans: unlucky hearts|pg||
pc|s2|nt|hawe45:  To please psrtner, South should overtake and plan @D Queen...|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mcphee: can actually manage 11 tricks here for a decent score|pg||
nt|mcphee: best is to take @D finesse asap|pg||
nt|MolvaM: might make 12 tricks if he finesses @d|pg||
nt|mcphee: yes |pg||
nt|zoh:  Mono i @h einai kalo gyrisma|pg||
nt|eleni: Those teams are Nos 1 & 2 up to now (in the first 3 rounds) No 1 is Altinis Team, while Sapounakis team is 2nd|pg||
nt|chick: he won't feel bad for too long, there is simply no place for the losing diamond to go|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|Gerben42: how do you get 12|pg||
nt|cicus: at first sight N can be squeezed but he discards after dummy|pg||
nt|chick: unless ....  W leads the @D10 and N covers|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mcphee: the @D finesse is clearly best choice|pg||
nt|lelos: paizei ton zozi gia K@c kai A@s|pg||
nt|haans: if 3@C did show minimum East had no cards for slam|pg||
pc|c8|nt|eleni: Please be with us, tomorrow at 17:00 CET and Sunday 9:30CET|pg||
pc|s3|nt|MolvaM: @d finesse is not extremely risky as he can discard his @h loser even if @d finesse loses|pg||
nt|eleni: yes zoh, a @h return would have been killing|pg||
nt|Gerben42: no entries for @C@D squeeze|pg||
nt|mcphee: @h yes a better defence, but with right view nothing matters|pg||
nt|MolvaM: he needs friendly breaks in all suits though|pg||
nt|mcphee: @D hook cash A, @H to hand and ruff @D loser|pg||
nt|mcphee: draw trumps and claim|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|Gerben42: then you still lose a @H for 11|pg||
nt|eleni: with the 10@d return, he has chances|pg||
nt|lelos: +K@d fusika|pg||
nt|chick: E will have to stop now and try to trump some clubs|pg||
nt|haans: why cover the 10|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No - the @D-suit by far too weak|pg||
nt|chick: I didn't say he should, only that it's the only possible hope for W|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Was just ONLY chance for making the contract|pg||
nt|haans: agree there|pg||
nt|hawe45:  ThatÂ´s why S should overtake and play @D Queen|pg||
nt|chick: when you are outmanned, outgunned, and out of ideas, there is just one remaining hope ..... guile|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|haans: will soon be overruffed|pg||

pc|sT|pc|cQ|nt|chick: Yes, Hans, very astute and if S had seen that at the table, he would be a hero|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|c9|nt|chick: true, he would have to depend on the @H finesse then|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cA|nt|Gerben42: only way is a dummy reversal, ruff 3@C and win the @C9 as  12|pg||
nt|haans: 2 clubs + hearts = 3|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|eleni: 9@s and let it ride...........|pg||
nt|cicus: this is not a good line anyway, a @D should have dbeen ducked first|pg||
nt|haans: ruff 1 more spade = dummy reversal|pg||
nt|chick: but if he draws trump loses another club instead|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mcphee: can ruff @C good but still needs to finesse @D|pg||
nt|eleni: he thought too long and played the wrong card:) that's Manolis Protonotarios:) when he plays fast, he is a great player|pg||
pc|h3|pc|d3|pc|c6|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This idea with overtaking is not so stupid - itÂ´s the right defence|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|h4|pc|d5|nt|Gerben42: like he played but with @D finesse :)|pg||
nt|petrosa: but N is the TEACHER|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|haans: in IMPs play stand for 5% bidding for 60% (of the IMPs)|pg||
pc|cT|pc|h5|pc|d6|pc|s9|pg||
nt|hawe45:  If West has the @D King, gameÂ´s over|pg||
pc|c7|nt|hawe45:  HELP PARTNER itÂ´s called|pg||
nt|chick: but from S's point of view, he may think the diamond finesse is HIS only hope :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  ... a finesse without starting with the KING?|pg||
nt|chick: good point :)|pg||

nt|eleni: yuck|pg||
nt|haans: 3@H was not the best way to slam|pg||
nt|haans: np|pg||
nt|chick: what is the aggressive lead against a slam guideline?     lead away from the closest thing you have to a trick |pg||
pc|c3|nt|liarakos: i think 3@H is too much space consuming|pg||
nt|eleni: no girls at this table, and as you know @d are girls best friends|pg||
pc|c7|nt|eleni: a nice play would have been the 10@c and a small @s to the 10|pg||
nt|rodal f: How to handlethe @D color by 3 missing? Here u are a nice site by %: http://www.bridgehands.com/P/Probability_of_Card_Distribution.htm|pg||
nt|haans: best way to get 2 :)|pg||
nt|chick: if I knew partner had both black suits, I would lead a club in preference to a spade|pg||
nt|chick: it does seem their system is getting them too high,  usually think of big club systems as keeping you low when responder is weakish|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mcphee: i pass the N hand myself but understnad the need to bid|pg||
nt|bmkl: they didn't missed this one|pg||

pc|h4|nt|MolvaM: just claim and get it over with|pg||

nt|ghionis: give trick back|pg||
nt|ghionis: he is very polite":)|pg||
pc|d6|pc|c5|nt|mcphee: well S gets all the blame for this hand, N contriubted just a little|pg||
nt|MolvaM: a simple 2@s reverse from south would be enough. but anyway|pg||

mb|1C!|nt|petrosa: playing natural...|pg||

nt|lelos: 1nt or 2@s ?|pg||

nt|cicus: I would not have predicted the 2NT rebid even if I had 5 guesses|pg||
nt|haans: normal to miss this slam|pg||
nt|cicus: you can get there using standard methods by opening 1@C then reversing into @Ds|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: S called the director|pg||

nt|eleni: Taso 50 years ago anyone would have opened 1@h with E's hand:):) dreadful but true|pg||
nt|rodal f: Will it end -1 or -2 by a @S ruff and miss the @D?|pg||
nt|lelos: i think down 2|pg||

nt|eleni: South, Nick is still thinking:)|pg||

pc|cA|nt|mcphee: another good think about splitting the @S honors is N is more likely to return the suit if they win it\|pg||
nt|MolvaM: so making 2nt will be a good score I expect|pg||
nt|mcphee: N should find the @D shift now I think|pg||

nt|cicus: yes, being 'on air' may add to the anxiety tremendously|pg||
pc|s3|nt|haans: nothing is easier than errors in defense|pg||
pc|sK|nt|haans: to get 9 needed deep @D finesse|pg||

nt|eleni: only on a similar play Murat:)|pg||
nt|mcphee: i would be delighted with 180 myself|pg||
nt|Gerben42: maybe ...|pg||
nt|MolvaM: difficult to play diamonds after east opens 1@d|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: 2min break|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 1@D is almost a psyche *g|pg||
nt|eleni: a 75% score for our Ladies here, one can say|pg||
nt|mcphee: well that is true, but on the @C play S shows not interest so what is left?|pg||
nt|eleni: you are so right Bob|pg||
nt|MolvaM: but eleni said they all play udca no?|pg||
nt|zoh:  Nai ta koritsia piran 2 poly kala score apo 2 poly kaloys paiktes|pg||
nt|eleni: yes Murat, they do|pg||
nt|mcphee: if they play usdca S carded wrong|pg||
nt|MolvaM: if udca, then south must have liked the @c shift. hence north continued the attack|pg||
nt|MolvaM: so north is innocent|pg||
nt|eleni: he might have false carded though, just to mic up the girls|pg||
nt|Gerben42: they were very mixed up|pg||

nt|haans: they did it|pg||
pc|s3|pc|c2|nt|Gerben42: @D is right? @S counts more|pg||
nt|tez: usually 2@s after an initial dbl is a stronger hand|pg||
nt|tez: with E i wld definitely bid 2@d over 1@s|pg||
nt|chick: good lead ... partner very unlikely to have an entry to lead hearts thru declarer|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|d2|nt|rodal f: Wander if the X and X from N made S belive more HPs at N. Don't have there CC|pg||
nt|lelos: i think 1@d shows unbalanced hand hence the 1@c|pg||
nt|eleni: no CCs available today, I hope there will be for the final 4s|pg||
nt|lelos: all other natural|pg||
nt|rodal f: After input from some specs: It seems that S took to much vitamins before the last bid:)|pg||

nt|eleni: Last board of this segment so see you in a few minutes|pg||
nt|haans: 1nt-3nt|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|eleni: As we all know Bobolakis and George Karlaftis both are teams' players. They rarely risk their contracts|pg||

nt|MolvaM: against 140|pg||
nt|tez: 3nt pls:)|pg||
nt|mcphee: 4@C bound to get dbled|pg||
nt|mcphee: 3N will not be|pg||
nt|eleni: 4@d would be a bad bid by Dimos|pg||
nt|tez: trust your partner:)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 3nt gets doubled faster|pg||
nt|MolvaM: but north would run probably|pg||
nt|chick: that will warn them off of 3N|pg||
nt|haans: best you can do is double|pg||
mb|2S|an| |nt|cicus: many play that 1@D - 2@C denies a major|pg||
nt|cicus: hence the 1@H response|pg||
mb|p|nt|bmkl: no risk no return Eleni :)|pg||
nt|haans: 3nt not easy with @D lead |pg||
nt|haans: not that farfetched|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mcphee: you would be surprised if N dbled here and S bids 3N how often they save in 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: S might have stepped in with 2@H here|pg||
nt|petrosa: another -1|pg||
nt|petrosa: bad luck|pg||
nt|liarakos: i am not sure|pg||
nt|eleni: Last board of this Segment:) In about 15 minutes we'll watch the final and most interesting ending of this championship:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: a little soft, but what the hect|pg||
nt|cicus: has to decide if @Hs are 4-4 or @S finesse is on|pg||
nt|haans: but spade finesse|pg||
nt|cicus: @Ds, I mean|pg||
nt|cicus: 4-4|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No 2-@D bid to me - very bad, IÂ´m sorry. Could stop opponents from bidding an unmakeable 3 NT, can cost 300 against nothing etc.|pg||
nt|haans: really open 1nt in better Never be inlove with majors|pg||
mb|p|nt|harmon: If declarer plays a high club from his hand south shd drop Q|pg||
pc|d4|nt|petrosa: Q@h|pg||
nt|petrosa: and many -|pg||
nt|liarakos: maybe x @H and many down|pg||
nt|cicus: if @D5 led, it strongly suggests a 5-card suit|pg||
nt|haans: playing will take time|pg||
nt|hawe45:  OK, then 2 @D worked good - the lead|pg||
nt|chick: 3N bid at the other table, but made without a diamond lead|pg||
pc|d3|nt|eleni: George you are right, Nick Perdikaris is an aggressive player:)|pg||
nt|ghionis: :)|pg||
nt|eleni: but in this case he decided to use the law of total tricks|pg||
nt|eleni: and it will work|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|cicus: because of rule of 11|pg||
nt|haans: @D4 = five cards|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|MolvaM: yes we are surprised :)|pg||
nt|eleni: true, this is why on board 16 they lost an IMP|pg||
pc|dA|nt|tez: 1 down|pg||
nt|mcphee: things lay well for declarer|pg||
nt|liarakos: 5@H x in the open|pg||
pc|d7|nt|eleni: a wild bidding:)|pg||
pc|d5|nt|liarakos: -2 probably so 11 imps to Levi|pg||
nt|cicus: on the run of @Cs S will have to find discards, however|pg||
nt|haans: specially attention to J and 10|pg||
nt|chick: being doubled does have that effect :)|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|mcphee: W overstepped hi bounds with this 4@S bid|pg||
pc|dK|nt|hawe45:  Yes - but here that danger didÂ´nt exist - S had bid NT allready|pg||
nt|haans: withour @D bid from W|pg||
pc|h7|nt|mcphee: good point, but as @D run nothing helps|pg||
nt|eleni: 3dx=|pg||
nt|harmon: true I just pointed it out cause Stevo did that to me to beat me, I almost got it right cause it was Stevo|pg||
pc|d9|nt|eleni: not this board:):) that was for the operator of the other table:):) board 5@h|pg||
nt|eleni: in the open room E-W on this one scored +1 for 450|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|tez: w shld not decide here|pg||
nt|mcphee: not sure what he was thinking, but this is not what you do|pg||
nt|chick: exactly, so the diamond bid was kinda necessary, even if only to direct the lead|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|nt|MolvaM: now we know that west is a certified overbidder|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|nt|haans: some say attiude lead better at nt for not tell if 4-4 of 5-3 in suit|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ghionis: bad timing for altinis he went down in this|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|mcphee: so reccomended is Q@C now not 10:)|pg||
nt|harmon: rofl yup|pg||
nt|jcone: no chance of Queen play now|pg||
nt|mcphee: which would have a good shot had he overcalled:)|pg||
nt|lelos: another 4 imps for altinis here since 9 tricks are easy|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|liarakos: oops|pg||
nt|cicus: I agree|pg||
pc|hT|pc|s5|nt|rodal f: ? Kill the cat. And @S|pg||
nt|lelos: not very carefull play by coach|pg||
nt|haans: need spade K10 at west to make|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|tez: with a bal hand with  defensive values in @d and limit opening hand|pg||
nt|MolvaM: they are sweet ladies remember|pg||
nt|Gerben42: I guess east had an opinion about 4@H|pg||
pc|cA|nt|cicus: and 4th best does not tell the quality of the suit, making a switch harder|pg||
pc|c7|nt|MolvaM: so they expect their opps to be polite in defence|pg||
nt|eleni: no way to save the -1:(|pg||
nt|bmkl: -2 maybe|pg||
nt|bmkl: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: Thanks all, see you in about 15 min :)           @H|pg||
pc|c2|nt|eleni: true, he had to continue with a @s|pg||
nt|haans: sort of squeeze|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|cicus: S could have pitched a spade but then all @S are high|pg||
nt|haans: do not need finesse in spades|pg||
nt|cicus: E probably went for @Hs|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: director signed the score on the 6th board|pg||

nt|chick: maybe trying to unblock for his partner?   but it certainly went wrong this time|pg||

pc|s9|pg||
nt|mcphee: wow, was not sure if that was going to grow up to a trcik or not|pg||
nt|maj_gr:  a heart to the K and duck by S might lure declarer|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|Gerben42: maybe the system was wrong, ok :)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mcphee: the system that reccomends a t/o dble of 1@C that hand is yet to be written:)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: maybe the deal was wrong? :)|pg||
nt|tez: :)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: i've seen it in play - it's "if I have 14 HCP i must dbl since bidding is weaker"|pg||
nt|MolvaM: and greek ladies are never weak?|pg||

nt|eleni: at the open table just a 3@c+1|pg||
nt|lelos: not this one :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Thanassis:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: Last board for today. See you tommorow :)|pg||
nt|maj_gr:  a lost opp for EW in other room|pg||
nt|petrosa: usally it is not good habit to lead A in no trump without good suit|pg||
nt|ghionis: terrible result i think|pg||
nt|cicus: I apologize for disturbing you|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: :)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mcphee: possible failing slam here|pg||
nt|ghionis: they have to wait for Argyrou result now|pg||
nt|cicus: good result for NS in OR|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
mb|2D|nt|mcphee: 6@S has a slight chance|pg||
nt|haans: easy make in 3nt (@H lead)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|MolvaM: a nice slam hand|pg||
nt|eleni: indeed Bod and so did the other table 6@h-1|pg||
nt|mcphee: but any slam should fail|pg||
nt|mcphee: 6@S also fails, but it is a better spot than 6@H|pg||
nt|harmon: 1h -4c shd avoid slam|pg||
nt|mcphee: geee harmon, it would not stop me|pg||
nt|harmon: well nuttin stops you|pg||
nt|mcphee: too many controls in s hand|pg||
nt|maj_gr:  they should be in 6, playing Polish club|pg||
nt|haans: most bid 3n spade lead down|pg||
nt|cicus: ah they have the methods here as well|pg||
mb|p|nt|eleni: provided they want to Tez:):)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 2@c must include 19-20 NT|pg||
nt|tez: 2@c 18 19 bal or..|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 2@H is puzzling *g|pg||
nt|harmon: shd get to 5h|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: or south is overbidding :)|pg||
nt|petrosa: in 19 4@H Dbl|pg||
nt|lelos: very good slam|pg||
nt|polyvlakas: without the 2 queens, it would be a normal vurnerable weak2|pg||
nt|haans: or not :)|pg||
nt|cicus: 5@C is only down on the unlikely @D lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: ah - transfer|pg||
nt|rodal f: Been nice to meet u. See u tomorrow at 17.00CET|pg||
nt|eleni: right Thanasi, 6 are there all the time, so let us see if Fotis and Aris will get there|pg||
nt|maj_gr:  the strong hand finds out 5-5-2-1 in West and there is a play even with 0 points|pg||
nt|haans: good cards in spade|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mcphee: yee old mexican 2@D|pg||
nt|MolvaM: the inventor of transfer bids must be rich with all the copyright money he gets|pg||
nt|jcone: 2 @C  game force|pg||
nt|mcphee: must be some form of gazilli|pg||
nt|petrosa: in the open room|pg||
nt|lelos: hmm|pg||
nt|rodal f: Pass and 10 tricks on RD|pg||
nt|haans: sure|pg||
pc|c5|nt|Gerben42: 6@C seems nice|pg||
nt|lelos: not even in 3:)|pg||
nt|maj_gr:  difficult to get there with natural system|pg||
nt|hawe45:  On a good day - playing @S to one looser - we get 110|pg||
pc|c2|nt|tez: 6@c is perfect|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 3@D must show @C then?!|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 6nt is more exciting|pg||
nt|Gerben42: I'm right - getting the hang of this|pg||
nt|harmon: Im told NS play the nunes/fantoni system|pg||
nt|petrosa: not 3NT |pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|jcone: the Double should put brakes on|pg||
nt|petrosa: it is easier if you know 52 cards|pg||
nt|liarakos: -1 so 19-9 to Capa final|pg||
pc|s2|nt|MolvaM: we want slams that make on a finesse, squeeze, throw-in etc|pg||
nt|mcphee: wow, 4@H opposite a GF strikes me as a very poor bid|pg||
nt|harmon: north doesnt have enuff to move|pg||
nt|petrosa: with clubs 2-2 slam is good:)|pg||
pc|s8|nt|haans: not easier to find|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ghionis: @S lead to go down|pg||
nt|cicus: lead quite sensible|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|mcphee: my lord|pg||
pc|s4|nt|MolvaM: not very enterprising|pg||
nt|mcphee: N did all he could I suppose|pg||
nt|mcphee: the strong hand bids like they have nothing, the weak hand pressed on with key card:)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|cicus: looked like N was short in @Ds|pg||
pc|s6|nt|MolvaM: maybe because they play against the president|pg||
nt|tez: and 6 nt with open hands|pg||
nt|lelos: i like a 3@c reopenig with maestro's hand|pg||
nt|eleni: Let's hope Aris Filios will think of the @c slam|pg||
nt|animeshraj: hi everyone|pg||
nt|eleni: Hello Animesh:) welcome:)|pg||
nt|animeshraj: ty:) sry running late here:)|pg||

nt|haans: body wouth a lot|pg||

nt|mcphee: S is none too pleased I suspect|pg||
pc|d7|nt|MolvaM: no president likes if her opps make a slam against her on vugraf|pg||
nt|eleni: let us hope that Maria Panagaki will get the hint|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i have a feeling we missed a lot of alerts|pg||
nt|haans: good lead for 110|pg||
pc|dA|nt|chrisky: nice pass by fotis|pg||
pc|d3|nt|lelos: another push|pg||
nt|animeshraj: wow!|pg||
nt|eleni: don;t worry, 1 more round is followin 10 minutes after this last board|pg||
nt|animeshraj: this cant be a NF 4@C|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mcphee: well maria is going to be unhappy this goes down|pg||
nt|mcphee: she asked if parnter held Q of trumps, and then bid slam anyway:)|pg||
nt|mcphee: must be in hope of a low @D lead|pg||
nt|fabsayc: missing 4 trumps including queen you are still more than 50% to make|pg||
pc|d2|nt|eleni: well, Christine can do magic and put to sleep opps:)|pg||
nt|polyvlakas: protonotar did not overcall |pg||
pc|s5|nt|petrosa: after the cue 4@C is forcing|pg||
nt|eleni: weird interpretation by Fotis Skoularikis|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|lelos: we will discuss this hand monday|pg||
nt|eleni: in the other table they were left in their 3NT:(|pg||
nt|petrosa: 3NT is better than 4@C|pg||
nt|animeshraj: with souths hand i dont think he wld play NT|pg||
nt|animeshraj: or want to..|pg||
nt|animeshraj: very nicely thought out by him,,, and he was well on his way to  .. glory|pg||
nt|eleni: As at the open table was said, the round ended up 26-20 for Judy Levi's team and 17-13VPs|pg||
pc|h3|nt|tez: 5@c+4@h+2@d+1@s|pg||
nt|mcphee: if W continues @d there is a chance at success|pg||
nt|harmon: if d played and E lazy she can make|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Even for 140|pg||
pc|h6|nt|eleni: this is true:):)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: really? shows how good the club is|pg||
nt|bmkl: very clever line by Fotis :)|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|mcphee: it is hard to find any fault with the auction|pg||
nt|Gerben42: but can understnad 3NT bid after pd shows my two short suits|pg||
nt|eleni: The boys are not members of her club:)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: south hopes that @d finesse is off and everyone else gets a @s lead|pg||
nt|mcphee: perhaps S with such good @C could advance with 4@C, but at pairs this seems not that wise|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: Thats all for now|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: Thanks all, see you in about 15 min :)|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d8|nt|rodal f: If there is any children here. Put them at an other room for some minuts:)|pg||

nt|cicus: can play west, the overcaller for @DAK|pg||

nt|haans: at OR west raise 3@H to 4|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|MolvaM: well now they know that to bid 4@h is not the way to win|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s7|nt|chick: 2.  figure out where you will get 5 tricks in highcards|pg||

nt|cicus: these -300's don't help Rakvere's case|pg||
nt|haans: suprised the bid it|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: good 3N for n/s|pg||
nt|cicus: no traps here, an easy 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: EW have a double fit. lets see how high the will go this time|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Flat boards - no hope for the traling team|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|haans: bidding to 4@S in OR not standard|pg||
mb|d|an|5 !C|nt|MolvaM: dbl?|pg||
nt|haans: looks like a pen double :)|pg||
mb|1S!|nt|chick: this session started out with a lot of big swings both directions, but then it got much duller  :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: he can only ruff his own spade trick|pg||
nt|haans: xx is still not game|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mcphee: E should dblle and west can jump around in @S|pg||
nt|MolvaM: until 4s at least|pg||
nt|mcphee: why he is going so slow this time is a mystery|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|MolvaM: he learns quickly|pg||
nt|mcphee: this time he has a 4@S bid:)|pg||
nt|haans: sorry 6 spades|pg||
nt|cicus: but it was sensible|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|MolvaM: on a good day 4s might even make|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: nice|pg||
nt|chick: somehow they managed to miss their nice heart fit|pg||
pc|c6|nt|cicus: checkback in action again|pg||
nt|haans: but found godd nt|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|MolvaM: 4s now surely|pg||
pc|cA|nt|haans: down if S play small to @C9|pg||

pc|c3|nt|MolvaM: oh well almost :)|pg||
pc|c7|nt|mcphee: W has not reverted to a different flight of fancy:)|pg||
nt|mcphee: now reverted|pg||
pc|c9|pc|d3|pg||
nt|haans: 8 tricks|pg||
pc|c4|pc|d7|pc|cT|nt|cicus: going for the ruff, not risking @D finesse|pg||
nt|cicus: hard to find a promising lead from the E hand|pg||
nt|haans: do they have a claiming talk?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: no, E just thinking|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|mcphee: more @S looked like a better defence|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h5|pc|hA|nt|haans: no likely|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|chick: bet he wishes he were in 4@H about now|pg||
pc|h4|nt|MolvaM: easts should not have passed the double of 1@s I guess|pg||
nt|mcphee: now S is facing a little problem|pg||
nt|mcphee: looks like he is going down|pg||
nt|MolvaM: maybe east was trying to apply the brakes from the passenger seat :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzge: in Greece doubles must not be alerted, so EW learn the meaning just before the lead|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hJ|pc|hT|pg||
pc|h8|nt|mcphee: so that solves the problem of, I think you are going for 800 dbles:)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: oh thats interesting|pg||
pc|d2|nt|cicus: N takes the sure route|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: and now playing very fast...sorry|pg||
nt|haans: squeeze in @H+@D|pg||
nt|cicus: and he will be rewarded with an overtrick by means of a squeeze against E|pg||
nt|haans: must loose a clubs to get the count right|pg||
nt|cicus: np the rest plays itself|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|pg||
nt|MolvaM: so if I visit the club and alert parners double, I will get a penalty?|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|s4|pc|d4|pc|d5|pg||

mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|henryb:  1@h is a transfer? or a possible relay?|pg||
nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||

mb|3S!|mb|p|nt|roswolf: both sides play Estonian Beach Diamond?|pg||

nt|mcphee: @S slam going down 1?|pg||
nt|cicus: oh sorry I missed that, then a @D return from east spoils the squeeze|pg||
nt|chick: two more boards for today|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: yes, and again, today we broadcasted all of the A league teams|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: tomorrow we'll have three sessions with the leaders|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: starting at 9.30 (UTC+2)|pg||
nt|chick: I thought he might play @D hoping to find a spade endplay|pg||
nt|haans: North must have 2 spades|pg||
nt|haans: why did he play the Q|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: we expect some frisky interference |pg||
nt|mcphee: oh maybe not over 2@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: wow, 3@H i want to try suicide again :)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: west recovered from his guilt :)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: @hA lead could be costly|pg||
nt|mcphee: west goes bonkers only every other board:)|pg||
nt|cicus: apparently, it did not happen|pg||
nt|haans: Riinu been a pleasure  :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: thx, but two more boards to go still :)|pg||
nt|haans: sure|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|haans: play of the cards for overtricks not for IMPs|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|mcphee: dopi, dble with zero I expcet|pg||
nt|MolvaM: are they on the same wavelength regarding the number of keycards?|pg||
nt|chick: S barely has an opening hand, so will not push, but N might|pg||
nt|haans: kib agree: Sundiszno: nortIf north had @sQxx, he'd have another card left to discard instead of the last spade|pg||
mb|3H|nt|mcphee: N should go|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: just not the right day for it|pg||
nt|MolvaM: initially north was hoping for a grand|pg||
nt|cicus: as I am told declarer could have ruffed a heart high|pg||
nt|haans: DOPI or DOPE|pg||
nt|chick: this will be a very hard decision for N when it comes around to him|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|haans: gross missunderstanding|pg||
nt|chick: next 'suit' up shows 2 keycards|pg||
nt|chick: although I prefer DEPO above 5 of our suit|pg||
nt|haans: or D = ODD P = EVEN|pg||
nt|chick: on previous hand, a sometime partner of Tihane tells me Tihane showed balanced hand with @c stopper when bidding 1@s, with Tihane, 1@s and 1nt responses to 1@c are reversed; but ...|pg||
nt|chick: the dbl could have confused Dalberg here (probably thought that the system is off)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|MolvaM: ahh|pg||
nt|mcphee: and it seems his judgement will be rewarded |pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzgn: yes, that was it|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: but it wasn't for Tihane|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|MolvaM: so difficult not to lead it after pd's 5@h bid|pg||
nt|cicus: lead does not matter here as 2 clubs to lose anyway|pg||
nt|chick: or DOPE as you prefer :)|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c6|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|mcphee: that is true|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s5|pc|sA|nt|haans: we in Sweden did learn about DOPI 1971 when i was just a beginner|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|mcphee: E could have bid 5@C maybe|pg||
pc|s8|nt|vugraphzge: smal break|pg||
nt|MolvaM: even @d suit 4-3 would be sufficient to make it against a club lead I guess|pg||
nt|MolvaM: so a very cruel distribution|pg||
nt|mcphee: at last Mom arrives |pg||
nt|mcphee: 2 tops for n/w and one score where pairs might fail in 4@H brought home bye good play from S|pg||
nt|mcphee: surely this will give n/s a little boost in morale|pg||
nt|mcphee: they have played reasonably well thus far|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sJ|pc|s2|pg||

nt|chick: DOPI  is really  D0P1  still in use at lower levels|pg||
pc|sT|pc|d6|pc|sQ|pg||

mb|2N|nt|cicus: thanks Riinu for doing a nice job|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|mcphee: usually F 3@C but here N will break the relay and should bid 3@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|cicus: and thanks for specs for your interest|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mcphee: or 3N as he elected |pg||
nt|mcphee: with that short @C honor I would have tried 3@D|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cK|pc|c7|nt|chick: S should at least consider passing 2N.  non-vul and 4-suit misfit means hard to set up a long suit for tricks|pg||

nt|mcphee: now up to N to try and steal the @D trick|pg||

nt|chick: understand|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|mcphee: not that it will work in his favor mind you|pg||
nt|eleni: still a sound contract|pg||
nt|MolvaM: it seems NS play quite a system with all the artificial bids and transfers. so surprising to have seen them miss a simple major fit on hand  6|pg||
nt|mcphee: he needs to lead @D twice from hand for this plow to have any chance|pg||
nt|cicus: good result here for Rakvere, a double part score|pg||
