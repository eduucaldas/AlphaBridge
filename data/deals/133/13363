nt|Walddk4: You have created a broadcast of your own|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: two vulnerable game swings is an important gap|pg||
nt|hlortz: NS play sort of Kaplan-Sheinwold weak NT non vul 5cd majors and EW are a pretty tradional French pair father-son M Bessis being the father|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|hlortz: hello all. we are back i see|pg||
nt|chick: Hello Everyone :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: welcome to finals of this long event (barring overtime)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|daman: and away we go|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: hi there|pg||
nt|hlortz: note Martel opens 1@C not 1N playing weak NT|pg||
mb|2C|nt|othered1: somehow, Levin avoided the 1@H overcall and chose stay out.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N!|nt|daman: Mutton|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: operator, who is the bessis with spectacles?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but doing this allowed opponents to compete more easily, which often happens|pg||
nt|ritong: well, the opening bid was 1 NT|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|Vugraphzfe: father michel|pg||
nt|hlortz: 1@H lead director :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|ritong: yes, but east or west:)|pg||
nt|ritong: thanks|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: lucky to find pd with xx in @S    but he had few options|pg||
nt|barnets: e/w appear to have a lucky 3N with spades breaking 3-3|pg||
nt|chick: lucky also to get a 3-3 split|pg||
nt|ritong: an overcall remains possible, of course|pg||
nt|othered1: true|pg||
nt|ritong: but sporty|pg||
nt|fabsayc: nothing wrong with heart lead :)|pg||
nt|hlortz: yes and Martel trapped into the 4@S overbid.... |pg||
nt|othered1: Strong NT can be preemptive, too.|pg||
nt|ritong: certainly so  4@h looks cold, at first sight|pg||
nt|hlortz: yes need the @D ruff to hold it to 4@H so the preemptive strong NT strikes|pg||
nt|fabsayc: as they said when Versace did it, it was the heart seven that made suit good enough|pg||
mb|3N|nt|sybarra2: hello all and welcome back to Reno |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|daman: EW played in 2@D on the 4-2 in the OR|pg||

mb|p|nt|ritong: so, a no swing board|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sJ|pc|sQ|nt|hlortz: westart with a routine 3N - just a matter of overtricks|pg||

nt|hlortz: 9 IMPs to Zimmermann tightens up the match|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ritong: i might try to guess with their bidding style, but this is dangerous:)|pg||
mb|3C|nt|merijng: slam on finesse|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: A solid start, taking advantage of the opponents' methods|pg||
mb|3N|nt|dinos1: wrong red K|pg||
nt|ritong: thank you  you have two thomas on screen, actually|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: south pased in both rooms wisely|pg||
nt|barnets: and in open ew are trying for slam|pg||
nt|ritong: odds are thay will pay it back, with 15 boards left|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: in open south after passing came in with a 2@H bid |pg||
nt|ritong: but unsure:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: writing I think it says single suit but I can't really see that far|pg||
nt|fabsayc: passed hand balance seat double can be minor one suiter, even if that is not normal meaning|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: ouch|pg||
nt|othered1: west may feel obligated to get his @H into the auction.  But it's not without risk.|pg||
nt|fabsayc: martel may pass|pg||
nt|hlortz: martel tempted to pass?|pg||
nt|ritong: certainly so|pg||
nt|othered1: and lead @D?|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dJ|nt|janm: Double is normally a 4 card Major and a longer minor, but I think that the balancing double can also be a diamond 1-suiter|pg||
pc|dA|nt|barnets: e/w did very well to stop in 5@S in open|pg||
nt|merijng: stopped in 5 in the other room|pg||
nt|ritong: do they play weak 2 in @ds, jan?|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|ritong: opening, that is|pg||
nt|ritong: probably not, since lew has a pure hand for it|pg||
nt|janm: No, 2@d is Flannery|pg||
pc|h7|nt|barnets: west keycarded found partner with 1|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: should be fine now|pg||
nt|ritong: ahum|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: maybe the play with go faster than this afternoon|pg||
nt|ritong: okay, we have an other possible tip  the one who looks older?|pg||
nt|chick: another routine 4@H, probably flat|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: michel|pg||
nt|hlortz: another flat game... at least no room for commentators to make errors - yet :)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|daman: they might have too much momentum in this room|pg||
nt|ritong: lol  ok, forget it:)|pg||
nt|ritong: ok  thanks|pg||
pc|h3|nt|dinos1: @c cue - @h cue - 4N  -5@s|pg||
nt|barnets: and decided not to bank on the @D finesse|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/  for BBO-TV. Watch the play in both rooms at the same time, even while playing or in the lobby. Open one browser window per table|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: writing at both side of the table|pg||
nt|daman: do we all agree with the 4@H bid by East?|pg||
nt|janm: And although they might sometimes open 3@d with a hand like Lew's, not in second seat vul :)|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|ritong: i understand:)|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c2|pc|c6|nt|barnets: no|pg||
nt|daman: same here|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|ritong: so if tom brings this home, the gap will be divided by two  an affair|pg||
pc|c8|nt|hlortz: surely henri you know their styles well enough soon u will tell us who is pere et fils|pg||
nt|ritong: yers, but if i err, i will be in trouble:)|pg||
nt|hlortz: thats the idea!|pg||
nt|ritong: eheheh|pg||
nt|ritong: til now, the two auctions were automatic|pg||
nt|chick: I have it on good authority that Michel is the father and he is sitting east|pg||
nt|ritong: yes, michel is the father, no doubt about it|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ritong: all right now  thank you operator|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: fingers can only type so fast and follow the play|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: :)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|chick: depends on what 4@C was|pg||
nt|barnets: but slam is 50 percent|pg||
nt|chick: alerted, it could have been an asking bid|pg||
nt|barnets: which is ok|pg||
nt|dinos1: what's wrong with 4@h?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: cards really favorable for declaer, can make 3|pg||
nt|othered1: Looks like another methods swing.|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Good Morning everyone|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|dinos1: exchange @d-@h in W's hand|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ritong: hi|pg||
pc|d2|nt|daman: 11 to Fleisher now     a new leader|pg||
nt|merijng: Was 4H cuebid?|pg||
nt|daman: I think you need to be able to see a source of tricks     and East cannot see that really|pg||
nt|barnets: 22 imps on the position of the @DK|pg||
nt|dinos1: cue-bidding doesnt show extras. it shows location of controls|pg||
nt|daman: he is fortunate West had such a great hand|pg||
nt|barnets: the other room|pg||
nt|dinos1: E hand is limited but not W who sees source of tricks|pg||
nt|barnets: weinstein must have been dissuded from bidding slam by helgemos overcall|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|merijng: maybe zimmerman hoped for ace of club instead of king of spade in which case he need 1 out of 2 finesses|pg||
pc|c9|pc|h5|nt|othered1: Hi, Ralf|pg||

nt|ritong: tor helness got a bit more enterprising and paid 300|pg||
nt|hlortz: so probably 5 IMPs will go back on this hand... |pg||

nt|barnets: klinger - jackson|pg||
nt|dinos1: the whole book? :)|pg||
nt|barnets: yes|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|fabsayc: had he overruffed thomas should play to pin the nine, only winning combination|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|ritong: woof|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|ritong: 1440 is not for free|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|gambit: got to 3S in the other room - just in - tough to stop |pg||
nt|hlortz: yes 6@C is always there i think but 6N was a bit lucky to escape a @H lead|pg||
nt|othered1: Why 2@S?|pg||
mb|p|pc|h4|nt|barnets: and a spec with a sense of humour wants to know if it costs 10$|pg||
nt|dinos1: I knew pair who used 5-4-3-2-1 honor count|pg||
nt|merijng: boring boards until now, except the slam on finesse but thats just 50/50 so oke to bid or stay out|pg||
nt|ritong: south might cue twice|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2d rebid is any minimum i believe|pg||
nt|othered1: ty|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3@D seems obvious now to me|pg||
pc|h2|nt|barnets: not really |pg||
pc|hK|nt|gambit: does S raise 2@s to 3? I think so |pg||
nt|hlortz: yes that 9@S in west is a big card |pg||
nt|ritong: and with a six bagger, north should cooperate|pg||
nt|ritong: til now, he has promised three @ss, and he has six|pg||
nt|gambit: and a dearth of values beyond spade 5/6 |pg||
nt|ritong: superb decision by martel|pg||
nt|othered1: buit there's still that misfit |pg||
nt|hlortz: well the @C raise may salvage a near push  great bid at least on this hand :)|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|barnets: both sides could have made 3N|pg||
nt|warrens:  is 4@D now kickback?|pg||
nt|ritong: they probably will lose 2 imps, but have avoided the worst so far|pg||
nt|othered1: so 4N is?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: diamond cue presumably|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ritong: wow super well done|pg||
nt|ritong: extreme faith|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Marty sorry if I did wrong pd?|pg||
nt|warrens:  well, if 4@D is kickback, then 4N should be a @d cue bid|pg||
nt|fabsayc: undo|pg||
pc|h5|nt|barnets: but played in partials going down at the 2 level|pg||
nt|dinos1: ... and were down in suit p/score)|pg||
nt|hlortz: south quite the pessimist|pg||
pc|h3|nt|barnets: oth souths pushed to game on the last board|pg||
nt|merijng: true :), tough to bid 3nt with misfit like that and 24 hcp though|pg||
nt|othered1: now they have to put on the brakes|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|barnets: beating some of the commentators out of 6 imps|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|nt|merijng: true but i mean not so exciting for the audience , waiting for more exciting hands|pg||
nt|ritong: missing a key, they might|pg||
pc|dA|nt|dinos1: I dont mind tobe beaten o such a hands)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I don´t like 4nt with a void in partners suit, but perhaps another meaning than asking for aces?|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|barnets: it is one of te biggest tournaments around and we have a 3 imps margin|pg||
nt|barnets: I think thats pretty exciting|pg||
nt|barnets: also there has never been a french team in he final|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Please understand that the commentators may not have time to respond to private chat messages. No offence intended. Useful info much appreciated though|pg||
nt|barnets: that exciting for the french|pg||
nt|ralfwil: thx all for information about 4nt|pg||
nt|bucheister: 4C could be RCK for clubs and 4NT showed 2 and the Q|pg||
nt|ritong: so stansby will consider his possibilities against @c KJxx on|pg||
nt|fabsayc: funny seems to me both auctions kind of called for heart lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: now Thomas is asking about the written explan  now wants to call Director|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: written on paper that 5 diamonds|pg||
nt|ritong: and will certainly finesse @c J directly|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Martel says lead may make no difference play hand|pg||
pc|s8|nt|fabsayc: i dont care if partner did not double, i dont lead a spade, does partner double on k empty|pg||
nt|ritong: however, it loses versus stiff jack off|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: no further actions|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i need one trick, the heart king will do and anything else wont be lost by heart lead|pg||
pc|sA|nt|gambit: indeed, no chance at 4 after @D X3|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|pg||

mb|1D!|mb|1H|nt|janm: With one round to go in the Women's Swiss, these are the standings (rosters in today's bulletin): 1 Zur Campanille 81  2 Hampton 74  3 Bjerkan 70  4 Burger 60  5 D'Ovidio 67  6 ...|pg||
nt|janm: Baker 55|pg||
nt|ritong: but there is one stiff jack and three small singletons, so i think correct play is jack hook|pg||
mb|1N|nt|barnets: 12 tricks seem an awful lot here|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|merijng: yeah helness ducked the heart lead|pg||
mb|d|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sK|nt|hlortz: but with 2 entries to dummy if low to the Q fetch all small then cross to dummy to lead another....yes? that picks up KJxx for 1 loser also|pg||
nt|ritong: good point|pg||
pc|s4|nt|daman: fortunate @S lie|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: screen down ? on lead?|pg||
nt|daman: my Mom would drop the QJ|pg||
nt|barnets: not completely cold|pg||
nt|barnets: dec could misguess his way|pg||
nt|barnets: but not likely|pg||
nt|dinos1: but he cant go down|pg||
nt|dinos1: after @c lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: now looking at convention card|pg||
nt|barnets: better if north had led a diamond|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: okay here we go again|pg||
nt|dinos1: @d lead is another story|pg||
pc|s7|nt|daman: it seems like he is taking a long time for no reason|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well judged|pg||
nt|hlortz: well judged NS here - pressed on to 5@S other room|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|barnets: always a reason|pg||
nt|barnets: lets say he plays @S @SK and south has 4|pg||
nt|barnets: @SAK|pg||
nt|dinos1: @sA and no H appear?|pg||
nt|barnets: so maybe he should play @SK and finesse|pg||
nt|dinos1: why K and fin and not A and fin? N is more dangerous hand|pg||
nt|barnets: now he could go down with clubs 6-1|pg||
nt|daman: and @Ss 5-0     or 4-2|pg||
nt|barnets: thats why he is thinking|pg||
nt|dinos1: 2@s4@c3@h1@d=10|pg||

nt|daman: Hellooooo Vctor|pg||
mb|d|nt|barnets: hi victor|pg||
nt|ritong: delicate position|pg||
nt|ritong: 4@h/@s could be cold|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but you need to act i think|pg||
nt|ritong: and, on the other hand, balancing can induce a disaster|pg||
nt|fabsayc: that can happen getting out of bed|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: good eveing all|pg||
nt|henryb:  One the other hand you could easily be goung for a number when 1NT has no play|pg||
mb|3H|nt|dinos1: hello|pg||
nt|barnets: now we are at least half scottish|pg||
nt|chick: Hi Victor|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: zimmermann points to 3 clubs and says 3 card suit|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: ? leads|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|henryb:  I think Fleisher will just concede a spade and take his seven. He could go down if the spade is off and he uses the @dA to get to dunny|pg||
nt|ritong: nine tricks, likely|pg||
mb|p|nt|hlortz: notice if declarer gets to dummy he will start with 9@S to be able to repeat the finesse but yes he will likely just concede  a @S|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think 7 tricks are likely|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he still had diamonds stopped|pg||
pc|cK|nt|dinos1: cd esily be 6@c if @c were NAT|pg||
nt|ralfwil: that @dQ didn´t hurt:)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|odysseus69: hi Cornelia|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Multon its the system ?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: barnet -Jack says hi|pg||
nt|barnets: so dec can see if hearts split 4-3 and the try spades before going to @C finesse|pg||
nt|barnets: so dec has three strings to his bow|pg||
nt|daman: how many strings on a bow?|pg||
nt|daman: I never took violin|pg||
nt|daman: or fiddle for that matter|pg||
nt|barnets: and that gives him a very high percentage|pg||
nt|dinos1: check @hAKQ 1st,if not - play 3r of @s, then @c fin|pg||
nt|barnets: @DK @HAKQ if no brea@SA@SK|pg||
nt|barnets: should win @DK in hand|pg||
nt|barnets: to keep late entry in dummy|pg||
nt|dinos1: yes - to have ability to fin @c finally|pg||
nt|barnets: this looks like a textbook hand|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c7|pg||
pc|cA|nt|odysseus69: 1600 kibitzers have all chosen their line|pg||
pc|cT|nt|fabsayc: so no risk in winning ace for spade hook|pg||
pc|c2|nt|henryb:  The @h discard helped|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|d6|nt|odysseus69: none tried that|pg||
nt|barnets: strange|pg||
nt|dinos1: hmm, all eggs in 1 basket? @c now|pg||
nt|barnets: but no less it wors|pg||
nt|barnets: works|pg||
pc|d3|nt|barnets: now declarer has lost the ability to work on spades|pg||
nt|barnets: and would go down if hearts were not splitting|pg||
nt|dinos1: dcl can set @d trick as well - @d87 are falling)|pg||
nt|dinos1: has to fin now|pg||
nt|barnets: or may go down if hearts dont split|pg||
nt|barnets: in any event avastly inferior line|pg||
nt|dinos1: nb @c3-3? :)|pg||

nt|janm: no, the swiss isn't usually on vugraph|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|hlortz: when faced with a cross ruff lead trump but thats unappealing from martel's holding|pg||
nt|janm: diamond|pg||
pc|s8|pc|d6|nt|barnets: if dec had cashed his hearts west would have 2 pitches|pg||
nt|hlortz: maybe lew should play 8@S to shift to a trump if left to hold it|pg||
pc|s9|nt|Vugraphzfe: sorry about the crash|pg||
nt|ritong: never mind|pg||
nt|othered1: that's an interesting play|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: but nothing happened|pg||
nt|fabsayc: trump lead now or never|pg||
nt|ritong: how so, nothing happened:) he pitched a @c, a key play|pg||
nt|othered1: I'm not sure that works|pg||
nt|hlortz: as i said b4 the crash lew should have covered the spade witht he 8 so martel not left on lead... tom made IMO a great play pitching|pg||
nt|othered1: agree and it may have made the contract for him, if he continues to read the hand correctly|pg||
nt|ritong: i think he has a very accurate idea about opps hands|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Thomas sitting very calmly|pg||
nt|ritong: except about the @cs|pg||
nt|ritong: but he needs @cs 3/2 to make, so..|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he has to play for essentially the actual layout, nothing else will yield 10 trick|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no he does not|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he needs to score two ruffs in dummy and four in hand (if no trump shift)|pg||
nt|ritong: aren t your two last sentences contradictory?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no north can have four clubs|pg||
nt|fabsayc: would still work|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Martel is thinking very hard|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C!|nt|marlowepi: back to the well:)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|odysseus69: interesting possiblities in 6H|pg||

mb|p|nt|ritong: keep lucid!!|pg||
mb|2C|nt|chick: draw trump, strip, club endplay|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfe: Kamil I have my bid|pg||
mb|2D|nt|marlowepi: 3S would be a popular call withe E hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but it might push opps to making game|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3@s from N?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|dinos1: cant - @h4-1|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ritong: bravo|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: 4@H call needlessly aggressive IMO -- if partner rejects a game try, you won't want to be in game|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|odysseus69: can if he reads Norths discards|pg||
nt|barnets: well if you follow the play in the other room levin had the contract mde with 6 cards to go|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|odysseus69: and of course gets hearts right first|pg||
nt|barnets: north and south both came down to 2 clubs|pg||
nt|barnets: and no spades|pg||
nt|barnets: and levein still had a @D stop|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|ralfwil: for...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes though fall of D nine would have made him relax very soon anyway|pg||
nt|fabsayc: on a spade lead, he would have to duck first club and stansby misguess|pg||
nt|othered1: amight east's failure to double 3@S have influenced the lead?|pg||
mb|p|nt|dinos1: yes- makeable if guess @c position|pg||
nt|ritong: i do not think so|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c2|nt|odysseus69: deep finesse has no problem|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|marlowepi: W knows that E would always expect a spade lead|pg||
nt|ritong: doubling low level cues rarely is a good idea|pg||
nt|othered1: From west's perspective, south may well have better @D that run, so looking to beat 3N quickly isn't irrational.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, N did neg X|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|ritong: on the other hand, either east has a @s honor and that establishes five quick tricks, or he hasn t and probably can offer some opposition in the other suits|pg||
nt|ritong: but, clearly, thomas went for the fast kill|pg||
nt|hlortz: back to that wierd 3N thomas made,, it was *very* hard for stansby/martel to visualize 10x for declarer's spase stopper so maybe that was the key to the strange result|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it was hard to visualize that on W bidding, but even harder to visualize the A on N bidding|pg||

pc|dK|pc|d6|pc|d3|nt|barnets: so if the trumps had split dec would eliminate and pass the @C 9|pg||

mb|4H|mb|p|nt|doctorone: S's opening may be justified by the vulnerability and the lack of shape. But still, this is too much for a weak two.|pg||
