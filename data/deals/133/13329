nt|davidstern: There is a shortage of tricks on this hand even with three hearts there are only 4-3-1-0|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|davidstern: West must not get careless if a club is ever played from dummy|pg||

mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c9|nt|davidstern: If 2@D was a weak two in a major I am not a fan. I like to have exactly six so partner can judge the bidding and defence. If you mix it around it becomes very hard|pg||
nt|davidstern: So this will make exactly four after a club and club ruff and one diamond|pg||
pc|c5|nt|hawe45:  Agree - and the side-suit, bad it is, you better not have|pg||
nt|davidstern: At one other table 4@Sx went -500|pg||
