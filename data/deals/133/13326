mb|1C!|nt|Walddk4: Hello Jordan, Panja, Mike and Hans|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hi Roland, Panja, Mike and Hans.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and Marc, our operator|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: thx, hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|harmon: 2 very close matches|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|panja: 4@h will make because @C K is in..not easy to bid though|pg||
mb|1S|nt|panja: @DKQ seem like wasted values..|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Good morning everyone and welcome back to the Netherlands for a practise match between the host team and Russia. Three segments of 20 boards today|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: first set 37-4 Russia. Score not carried forward? |pg||
mb|p|nt|kareno: Fixed!!|pg||
nt|sharkey: Well done!|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello all and welcome|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Good judgement, @D better than @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Our operator is Marc van Beijsterveldt|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Your commentators Bill Jacobs and Jacco Hop|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Hello|pg||
nt|dutcho: Morning all|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|nt|harmon: ty Jan|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mdgraham: 2@D transfer, 2@s=break (good heart fit) |pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|s4|nt|jcwla: Not sure what the double of 4@D is -- some pairs play "double up" or "double down" of splinters asking for leads of low/high side suits.  Maybe not on same wavelength here.|pg||
pc|sK|nt|hawe45:  No - the russians are very fair|pg||
nt|mdgraham: followed by 4@D either splinter or (more likely) transfer at the four-level|pg||
nt|Walddk4: There is another match taking place simultaneously, so they are going to calculate an aggregate score by the end of the day I suppose|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Four pairs in each team. We have four of them at our visible tables (open and closed room) and another four at two "invisible" tables in order to give new operators some practise|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: imps are converted to VP and added up for both matches|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s5|pg||
pc|c4|nt|kareno: Is it Jan ... Hi there :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Sorry - rushing too much!|pg||
nt|harmon: Jan has no interest in other match of course:)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|vugraphzgq: Welcome from the 'bridge farm' 't Onstein in Vorden|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Good afternoon|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: slight delay in start because 4 Dutch players arrived a little late :-(|pg||
nt|panja: 4@D was a shot in the dark, it seems like....but N has three useful honours, @HAK and @CQ...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: thanks|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: this one was 24-6 to Russia, the other is not finished yet :-(|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c3|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: OF course not :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: The line ups are indentical from previous session both rooms; only directions have changed|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dT|pc|dJ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|dutcho: I am not sure if 1D was negative or showed hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: morning all|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d6|pc|dQ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: I am not sure too had to help other operator in mean time|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c7|pc|h4|nt|chessmaste: Declarer will claim in a moment|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Nor am I - and one cannot be sure if 1@S was, well ... what was it?|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|kareno: Brogeland sitting over Helness this time, however |pg||
pc|s8|nt|harmon: they switched rooms too|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: I thought that Saelensminde had played a heart on the third diamond but then I decided I must have seen it wrong, but in fact he did, and now on the 5th diamond he's played his ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: diamond and the director was called to establish the revoke and we're continuing|pg||
pc|s9|nt|kareno: The way this works, spectators, is that for a given set, one team sits first then the seeded team sits where they like.  The seed passes from team to team according to the ...|pg||
nt|kareno: conditions of contest, each team being seeded for two quarters.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Vugraphzfb: Director has ruled that there is a 1 trick penalty for the revoke.|pg||
nt|rodal f: Still the question is: Have Boye and Silla made up a psycologic against Geir and Tor?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfb: Brogeland asks whether he could have asked and is told that he could have.|pg||
nt|sharkey: Fatigue factor coming into play perhaps - late in the contest|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|panja: the rules have changed in 2007 edition, especially re revoke|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cJ|pc|h7|nt|jcwla: Another possibility is to use "double up/down" when vul but dbl suggesting a sac when not vul.  As between double up or down, there is a slight theoretical advantage to down b/c ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: you _could_ bid the up suit at the same level.|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: EW now discussing the meaning of the double|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: they decide that further discussion is needed :-)|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|dutcho: well if this looks like a polish club auction|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s6|pc|s3|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hQ|pc|hT|pc|h8|pg||
nt|dutcho: this was not the best defense for EW so 110 now|pg||
mc|8|nt|dutcho: Sorry it is still early for me aswell|pg||
nt|vugraphzgq: Polish club style, 1@D weak, 1@S could be 3, 2@H nat, weak|pg||
