nt|Walddk2: I don't see anything wrong with 3@D|pg||
nt|marlowepi: ancient chestnut in bidding-panel features|pg||
nt|woozle: 3D is a mild overbid for diamonds and conceals the spade support|pg||
nt|henryb:  3@d looks very reasonable unless you play that as sound as KS used to|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|woozle: 3D leaves South with a horrid guess over 3NT|pg||

mb|p|nt|marlowepi: best is 2C artificial if u have it available as KS did before many of our viewers were boren|pg||
pc|h7|nt|woozle: If 2C is left there you won't miss a game, although you may not make 2C|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, if partner is interested in spades, he could have rebid his suit, but apparently he is not when he chooses 3NT|pg||
pc|h6|nt|marlowepi: S has no horrid guess over 3N. he passes and hopes it is right. cant bid 4S|pg||

nt|woozle: A good slam for NS here...6D is good but 6NT is better, entailing no risk|pg||

mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3D|nt|Walddk2: There are BridgeMates in use and therefore almost live online scoring |pg||

mb|6D|mb|p|nt|woozle: Weird auction from South, who has three trumps and a ten count and has missed two chances to support diamonds|pg||

mb|p|nt|henryb:  well, opposite xxx Kxxx xx Axxx he would have little play for slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: was advance cuebidding i think|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3N meant to show club values i think|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6@D much safer from Lusk's point of view because partner could have @SA instead of @CA. @HK is a certainty after the 2@S response|pg||

mb|d|nt|marlowepi: when in fact he just has spades, and a dubious offemse-to-defense ratio for a pre-empt|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|woozle: Christie's 2NT rebid is a practical choice...heart fits shouldn't be lost, and it's probably good to play it from this side|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|woozle: And it's often right to give the auction some brakes, with a good hand and the lively prospect that partner has a poor hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: perhaps....2H does not preclude playing from his side, and the hand looks a bit more suit-priented|pg||

nt|woozle: Neither line was likely, not least because if the diamonds run there are eight top tricks, and a heart play may risk that|pg||
