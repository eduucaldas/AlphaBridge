mb|4S|mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rhelle: so he can pass with anything non-fitting up to 9 or so|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A tactical pass, but it might have backfired|pg||
nt|imp_jan: west will dbl (2 aces)|pg||
nt|henryb:  tough for West to know his best action is to pass out 1@h|pg||
mb|d|nt|imp_jan: there he is|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: He could do, but it is not common to do so. Playing a standard system, players respond on some very weak hands (3-4 points), merely to inconvenience the other side.|pg||
pc|s7|nt|brolucius: I am referring to South's pass.|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sJ|pc|d3|pg||
nt|rhelle: true - he has these options too, but they generally do that with a fit|pg||
nt|imp_jan: declarer will soon come to 11 tricks losing a diamond and a club (ruffing a heart)|pg||
nt|rhelle: 1 top diamond, then @hs?|pg||
nt|brolucius: There are several 1@H openers (including the present hand) that will make 4@H opposite South's 8-count.|pg||
nt|imp_jan: so looks like first blood to NL|pg||
nt|rhelle: that is true David - but these hands rarely get passed out|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Four pairs in each team. We have four of them at our visible tables (open and closed room) and another four at two "invisible" tables in order to give new operators some practise|pg||
nt|brolucius: Maybe, but what do you gain by passing (except having a laugh when they protect and you bid game then...)|pg||
nt|rhelle: you gain a lot when 1@h is passed out and makes on the nose|pg||
nt|rhelle: in other words, you don't run the risk of getting too high|pg||
nt|brolucius: Oh, you remember an occasion when that happened? |pg||
nt|rhelle: and sometimes the opps protect in a misfit situation, and you pick up a juicy penalty|pg||
nt|rhelle: last night :) 1@h = for +80|pg||

mb|3D|mb|p|nt|rhelle: lol - I'm not a fan of it, as partner never knows where he stands if he has a big hand|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3@H or 4H from West would be pre-emptive, so he shows a sound raise by bidding the opponents' suit.|pg||
nt|imp_jan: a splinter of 4@C wld have been a possibilty with the west hand|pg||
nt|rhelle: 3@d is generally played as invite  or better in partner's suit|pg||

nt|brolucius: the Q), North switches to the second priority signal (count), as Rob says.|pg||
nt|brolucius: If dummy had gone down with a singleton spades, both attitude and count would be irrelevant and North would then give a suit preference signal (3rd priority).|pg||

nt|chessmaste: West might have done better to bid spades at some point - even 2@S was possible - then the double fit comes to light|pg||

nt|imp_jan: 2@D over 2@C Gazzili shows a 8+ hand normally, may be this the Russian version|pg||
nt|brolucius: 15 opposite 9, and two five-card suits, would often give you good play for 3NT. But here the singleton @SA in partner's suit is a disadvantage. Also, East has no points in his ...|pg||

pc|c3|pc|c9|nt|Vugraphzfb: Helness explaining what Helgemo has shown to Silla, but in Norwegian - I think that 3@c promised clubs and was forcing to game, but that's just from the body language|pg||
nt|sharkey: As Henry mentioned they have "rightsided" the contract so shudnt be anything to the play|pg||
nt|panja: could W have rebid 3@H on 3@D to keep alive chances of playing in 3NT? or should E have rebid 3N instead of 3@D?|pg||
