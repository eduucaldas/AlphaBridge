mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|d|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|athene: 6@S is about 50% i suppose; basically on the diamond finesse|pg||
nt|rosenknopp: a lot better after the double|pg||
mb|3C!|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|athene: yes, the double is good news for the @DK but makes it slightly more likely spades are 5-1, i suppose|pg||
nt|chick: same for 6@Hs|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|athene: 5-1 in either major will beat|pg||
mb|3S|an|cuebid|mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|nt|athene: sorry 4-1 hearts or 5-1 spades|pg||
mb|6H|an|2 A and void in spades|mb|p|nt|athene: west is thinking about whether to pass this or bid 6@S i guess|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|nt|chick: fortunately, it doesn't matter|pg||
nt|rosenknopp: 7!|pg||
nt|athene: 6@H would be difficult with no entry to dummy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 7 what, Marianne? :)|pg||
nt|rosenknopp: whichever :)|pg||
nt|chick: there are about 13 tricks, right after they cash the @HA :)|pg||
nt|athene: 6@H wouldn't be fun; let's say club lead, so you go @CA, @SA throwing a club, diamond finesse|pg||
mb|6N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: but now north can eventually give his partner a diamond ruff when he wins the @HA, i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Well, on a very good day you make 12 tricks in notrump even on a club lead|pg||
nt|athene: north is going to get crushed on the run of the spades|pg||
nt|athene: he gets squeezed in three suits|pg||
nt|chick: he can pitch clubs|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d5|pc|d7|pc|dT|pg||
nt|chick: only feels like a 3-suit squeeze :)|pg||
nt|athene: he can't throw ALL his clubs|pg||
nt|athene: otherwise you can concede a heart|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|h4|pg||
nt|athene: this often happens when a defender wants to guard two suits AND keep a card to lead to his partner's winners - he has to let something go so you have pressure even without the ...|pg||

pc|c3|pc|cJ|pc|cT|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d8|pc|d6|nt|athene: yes, you are hardly happy rebidding 3@D after 1@C (2@H) X pass|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|athene: that's why traditionally you open 1@D with that hand :) so you can rebid 3@C|pg||

nt|chick: :)|pg||
nt|chick: Stornes'll be happier when he finds out he gained 3 IMPs|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Stornes has no reason to overrule partner here|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Well, he thought he had|pg||
pc|c3|nt|chick: small doubleton might make him think 4@H yields an extra trick|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@H also makes, but 3NT seems a little better, not least because South has @S10|pg||

pc|d3|pc|dK|pc|d6|pc|s8|pg||

mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|chick: 7@S would be a great save vs 7@H,  or 6@S vs 6@H as well|pg||
nt|athene: 6@SX looks as though they sacced over 6@H which was risky - gave EW a chance to bid the grand|pg||
mb|d!|an|negative|mb|4S|mb|5C|nt|athene: only twelve available in clubs|pg||

pc|d6|nt|rosenknopp: aalberg is thinking wether høiland has @D q left; exit a @D not to endplay p|pg||
mc|9|nt|athene: a heart can't hurt|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good evening to Dima Nikolenkov|pg||

mb|2C!|mb|d!|mb|2D!|mb|3C|nt|dima:  Kit Woolsey would surely mentioned double flaw - only 6@c AND 4@s on the side|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|chick: From a wise kib:   that dbl from S is what we call an informative double...takes up no space and informs the opps about what to concentrate on|pg||
nt|dima:  So here we are - I suppose 2@c was semi- or gameforcing|pg||
nt|chick: if so, a terrible use of 2@C|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|cK|nt|dima:  Not my cup of tea too - I would plain open 4@h in 4th - chances are that partner wont have enough cover cards for slam|pg||

pc|h3|pc|h5|pc|h9|nt|chick: if S believes E's play of the @SA denies the K, he will have enough count to place the @CQ|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Bye for now|pg||
nt|athene: it was pretty dubious even so - when partner has a weak-2@S and you have @SAQxx @HQx then either you make 4@S or they make 4@H|pg||

mb|2N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Marianne Harding, member of the Norwegian ladies team|pg||
nt|athene: 2@S was probably showing that shape but weaker, so north sensibly decides to just lose the fifth spade|pg||
