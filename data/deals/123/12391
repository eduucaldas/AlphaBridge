nt|vugrapha3: Kowalski thinking|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is it better to play @HA @HK or immediate @H finesse of Jack -- seems declarer must rely upon 32 trump so not sure|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: still thinking|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Perhaps an immediate heart to jack?|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: cards are on the table....do not expect any play soon|pg||
pc|h2|nt|bjacobs: That will lose to stiff queen, and also if South can play a spade and North can ruff with the 10|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hJ|pc|h3|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Neither of those are particularly likely - so I agree with declarer's play here|pg||
