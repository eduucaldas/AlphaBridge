mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|dougdscsu: 4@s can also make with careful play|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|poohbear: I think the boys are trying to be too delicate here|pg||
nt|wesleyc: If 1C could be any balanced hand maybe Adam was worried about clubs for 3NT|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: Winners of this match join Nabil Edgtton - Paul Gosney and Michael Whibley - Justin Howard on the Australian U26 team that will play in the Junior PABF tournamnet in Hamilton, NZ, ...|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: as well as the World Juniors in the USA later in the year|pg||
nt|poohbear: Andy could have given his partner a second chance to bid 3NT by bidding 3S|pg||
mb|4D|nt|dougdscsu: Edgtton would do well to offer 4@s here..|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|nt|poohbear: Adam was worried that with his extras they might have slam since North is unlimited and I presume showed 4-5 in the blacks |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|poohbear: but the king of @h rates to be worthless so the prudent bid might have been 3NT |pg||
