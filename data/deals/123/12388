nt|Walddk4: They even brought this 4@H home|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It shouldn't make but it did|pg||
nt|petergill: so West can insert @C10 safely if he wants to - unless East with 532 is trying to be helpful, having supported, by leading top of nothing|pg||

nt|vugrapha2: EW calling the director|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: claiming that south had a long tank before his @H pitch when he had nothing to think about|pg||
nt|petergill: Final score is 46-44 to EW|pg||
nt|petergill: If partner had J10 doubleton, his heart pitch might cost an overtrick|pg||
nt|vugrapha2: adam saying that the fact he thought so long about it placed him with Qxxx|pg||

nt|petergill: Michael Whibley moved from New Zealand to Melbourne last year, and will be making his Australian debut. |pg||
nt|petergill: If Sam Schulz - Shane Harrison miss the U26 team, they will be in the U21 team, with two other pairs|pg||
