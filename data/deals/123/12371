nt|hedyg: maybe they open 2@d very weak +|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Krzy and William + specs and Bruno(the vug operator)|pg||
nt|rodal f: And Hedy:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: hi|pg||
nt|vugraphzer: Multi 6-9 hp vul|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty Markus|pg||
nt|hedyg: so he was really super maximum|pg||
nt|athene: borderline 3nt here; might be reached|pg||
mb|p|nt|cliveo: I've never known John and Michelle play so quickly :)|pg||
mb|1C|nt|sfoxa:  must admit the @h jack play - covering maximum chances to guess @h|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|snetram: modern preemptive|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: this should be an imp or 2 to NIBU|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Walddk2: Surprise, surprise, partner will bid clubs|pg||
nt|golfsquash: Hi all|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: Hi rory and specs hope the table is stable this time|pg||
nt|golfsquash: If e/w compete to 5@h, it will make on this auction!|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgk: sorry for this poor connection, still havent missed any play, W has called director|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgk: missed any play on this board*|pg||
nt|athene: 1nt will certainly get them there|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgj: sorry, making bidding up to catch up|pg||
nt|chick: I presume EW are playing a strong club system|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H!|mb|p|nt|hedyg: and what did you plan to bid...3@d|pg||
nt|snetram: its looks very strong|pg||
nt|hedyg: notice no lebensohl by E|pg||
mb|2N|nt|mdgraham: no problem, Stuart|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  1@c - 16+points, yes|pg||
nt|roswolf: maybe i am being harsh the diamond lead is not that obvious|pg||
mb|3C|nt|athene: club lead looks much more natural from east's hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzgj: test|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  re-hi, Julia )))|pg||
nt|chick: Our vugraph operator today is Ying Piper :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgj: N queried the @d bid when it was made|pg||
mb|4C|nt|kdr_fm: lts of chances given by N/s for e/w to show the majors|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: good chance west might wack this as a 2 way shot ... 5M makes and 5@C is -1|pg||
nt|athene: using the @SAK @HA to get the long suit going|pg||
nt|athene: now declarer might be able to come to two spades, two hearts, two diamonds, three clubs|pg||
nt|mcarroll: This is what the Americns cal "garbage Stayman" - where with short @Cs Stayman bidder can pass any rebid and hope to improve the contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: EW are brothers wich have played many years together in 1st and 2nd div. so they will land|pg||
nt|roswolf: if they bid 6@C they will probably make it|pg||
mb|4D!|nt|hedyg: small @H lead beats it immediately|pg||
nt|rodal f: Did not here|pg||
nt|snetram: nice lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgj: 4@d was response to 4@c?|pg||
nt|roswolf: except a lightner double from north might make south lead dummy's firsrt suit|pg||
mb|d|mb|p!|mb|p|nt|chick: this double is even more clear|pg||
nt|roswolf: ah he has got the double in anyway|pg||
mb|4H|an| |mb|p|nt|Vugraphzgj: i almost missed X - diffcicult to see!|pg||
mb|5C|nt|ady: likely swing for england|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  oh, sorry, I saw Julia's name in profile|pg||
nt|chick: it may be that the X saved them from bidding 6|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mcarroll: no double?|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||

nt|Vugraphzgk: S thought it was N, N meant it as shortage|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgk: natural*|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgj: Director giving table into trouble for talking through the screen|pg||
nt|ady: west may open a weak 2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and a good solid one it is too|pg||
nt|ady: north has no definate action|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Another Roland|pg||
nt|chick: that will be some more imps for NI|pg||
mb|p|nt|kdr_fm: 3@H N/s makes so 2@s is a good result in the open|pg||
nt|roswolf: an easy slam for n/s|pg||
nt|chick: 6@D is a bit of a scary contract|pg||
nt|chick: easy because 3 important cards are onside :)|pg||
mb|1D|nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|athene: a pretty definite pass i think :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|mdgraham: NS play 2M as 8-11, with 2@D reserved for weaker (0-7!) hands|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ady: likely to fail by 1 trick |pg||
nt|athene: double is just about vaguely possible from south|pg||
nt|rodal f: With the best spot NS|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  yes, NI comes closer|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgj: hi everyone|pg||
nt|roswolf: played by south 12 tricks on top barring a ruff|pg||
mb|2D|nt|kdr_fm: Having said that 3@h vul is alot of bidding on the N/S cards|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 1@H shows @Ss|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|an| |nt|mcarroll: 4@S is also a lot of bidding on the cards|pg||
nt|chick: this has potential for 3N --  as major suits lie, there is a stopper in each|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: the question here is whether declarer can build a diamond trick for a black-suit pitch|pg||
nt|ady: might  make on this lead  |pg||
nt|mcarroll: Dbl shows @Hs|pg||
nt|chick: that bid will help S in getting to slam|pg||
mb|2N|nt|chick: but 2@S asking for stopper, so they may end in 3N|pg||
nt|roswolf: no-one plays strong jump shifts any more the north hand is perfect for that|pg||
mb|p|nt|kdr_fm: right well .... this should be 5 imps or so to scotland|pg||
nt|athene: could put the @D8 in but playing low worked out ok anyway|pg||
nt|rodal f: And a good 2@S keept NS away|pg||
nt|roswolf: 6nt tou mean cornelia|pg||
nt|chick: 6N is fine, with the @SA onside|pg||
mb|6N|mb|p|nt|rodal f: Normaly waisted @SK. Then 6@Hand 11HP at N in vul, but....|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  but  missed, unfortunately. any major lead brings 9th trick, yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: yes, hard for W to see 3N with a hand of that time|pg||
nt|chick: gambling on a club stopper as well|pg||
pc|s6|nt|hedyg: are you suggesting that N should pass?|pg||
nt|chick: give S the @CKJ instead of A, and this is down instantly|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgj: declarer saying take your A@s at T1 and i get rest|pg||
nt|roswolf: true the sequence is not inspiring - they might have been a grand on|pg||
mc|12|nt|athene: i remember billy eisenberg's bridge tip was to play low in dummy even with nothing in hand - third hand won't know to take a deep finesse against dummy and it often lets you build ...|pg||
nt|athene: a trick from nothing|pg||

nt|chick: but EW did well to stop in 4, the other table defense dropped a trick by underleading the @SA|pg||
nt|chick: just another example of why you never underlead A's against trump contracts|pg||
nt|chick: do you suppose something in this auction showed the @CA?|pg||
nt|roswolf: not really|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|d|mb|3D|an| |nt|chick: around 2 is the limit of this hand either way|pg||

mb|p|nt|roswolf: everyone bids there are green cards as well!|pg||
pc|hA|nt|roswolf: ythis is just cold off|pg||
nt|chick: defense needs a diamond switch now to get max tricks|pg||
pc|h2|nt|rodal f: Why not try to take W after the 2@S? 3NT will be down by that bid|pg||
pc|hT|nt|kdr_fm: was 2c alerted stuart ?   keri ?  if stayman thats quite a position to take albeit abit unlucky ..|pg||
nt|golfsquash: good pass by north|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 2NT Lebensohl, compels 3@C and the 3NT shows @S stopper, adirect 3NT would deny a @S stop|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|ady: should be 2 down on normal defence|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, maybe not :)|pg||
pc|d8|nt|golfsquash: This is the kind of hand where declarer will scramble lots of tricks|pg||
pc|dA|nt|Walddk7: http://www.camrosebridge.com/  for a website with lots of useful information|pg||
pc|dK|nt|athene: 3nt looks a bit much|pg||
nt|ady: 3 imps to England|pg||
nt|cliveo: According to their convention card Hamiltons 1NT presumably shows 12-14 so quite a stretch by Ferguson|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes should be -2|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mcarroll: But Frank is right - a vanilla penalty double should gain|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|pc|s7|pg||
nt|ady: what did the 1NT rebid show?|pg||
nt|chick: A Bath Coup possible there|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: he must have thought 1nt was strong, surely|pg||
nt|mdgraham: presumably putting a lot of value on the @HK |pg||
nt|cliveo: their convention card says 1NT opener is 15-17|pg||
pc|s8|nt|rodal f: In OR NT came at Ns hand so here NS are taken by there 11-14     12-15NT|pg||
nt|roswolf: no only -1|pg||
pc|sK|nt|rodal f: Still must admit: @HK make there contract:)|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ady: then west was maximum for rebid  and still down 2|pg||
nt|rodal f: W lost a entery to early|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hJ|nt|kdr_fm: 6 tricks will be good going - 3 imps out and thankfully not doubled|pg||
nt|golfsquash: falling apart now :)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: C!J continuation rather than @S would have helped the scramble|pg||
nt|athene: maybe they are just taking offbeat actions in view of the match situation|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|h3|pc|c3|nt|sfoxa:  so again 1 imp in play - W did well playing @h K - now E can cash 2 @s tricks|pg||

nt|jcwla: 6@S also, no?|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 6@D slightly better I think|pg||
nt|ahh: however ruffs come into picture when there is a preempt |pg||
pc|d2|nt|jcwla: Too much to hope for it seems.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In 4@S you will likely only make 11 tricks|pg||

nt|roswolf: may be fun and games here|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|ady: easy game for n/s   |pg||
nt|athene: not a great 6@S here but it does make|pg||
nt|rodal f: Running resaults: http://www.camrosebridge.com/action.php Something wrong at the match Irland - England|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: marginal 6@S, nothing special |pg||
mb|p|nt|golfsquash: a chance here to recoup some Imps|pg||
nt|athene: if they don't lead @HA or a club you probably end up having to find the @HJ|pg||
nt|mdgraham: @HJ coming down in three rounds is handy|pg||
nt|athene: although there are various ways you can fiddle around|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and there is also a two-way finesse for it |pg||
nt|roswolf: scotland nowhere near the thin slam|pg||
mb|3D|nt|sfoxa:  32-boards match is rarely won by 1 imp, but as the situation goes, each imp is in count|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: maybe you ruff some hearts and/or clubs and then run trumps and hope for a squeeze if no big cards fell|pg||
nt|ady: unlikely to get beyond game|pg||
nt|athene: i seriously doubt they will play anywhere other than 4@S|pg||
nt|roswolf: why not double?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|roswolf: they miss both fits!?!|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3nt is incredible what is wrong with 3@S?|pg||
mb|p|nt|kdr_fm: yup scrambled lots a tricks there ... just dont agree with 2@C in teams .. maybe not vul its ok but 400 out ...|pg||
nt|athene: hmmm...2@C might get south interested|pg||
nt|cliveo: If they bid it I would expect them to make it|pg||
nt|chick: strange 1N, bypassing a 5 card spade suit|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: the problem with doubling on hands like south's is when it goes double all pass and the penalty is insufficient|pg||
nt|chick: I assume these alerted bids are somehow revealing it|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  must be. |pg||
nt|chick: ahhh, some kibs tell me that 1N promises 5 spades|pg||
pc|h6|nt|roswolf: WOW even if this makes n/s should be severely embarrassed|pg||
pc|c4|nt|kdr_fm: this works @Hk onside 620 in|pg||
nt|cliveo: What would you bid then?|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|athene: if you don't want to just bid 4@S on these hands, then play something funky like 4@C overcall is a "strong" 4major bid|pg||
nt|mdgraham: there is also the possibility that there may not be any penalty at all  |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  in the first half, EW were announced as long-term partnership  having plenty of agreement|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|chick: I'm also told that 2@D may be three and 3@C is FSF|pg||
pc|c9|nt|chick: must be, because they are getting to the right contract :)|pg||
nt|chick: and it will :)|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ady: diamond lead and continuation means heart finesse of the 10 is necessary to make 12 tricks|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c2|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d2|nt|roswolf: no it wont|pg||
nt|chick: if he plays for spades, not diamonds|pg||

nt|chick: better :)|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cA|pc|c6|pg||
pc|s5|nt|golfsquash: no need for that senond heart|pg||
nt|golfsquash: second|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: @d7 would have been better suit ptrf for @h, but S sould figure out why N underled the @dk|pg||
nt|golfsquash: The bidding is also a clue|pg||
pc|sT|nt|athene: if you lead the @HK and west wins and switches there will be a double squeeze around hearts|pg||
nt|mcarroll: when the NT opener makes a free bid after a nonforcing bid from partner anything can happen - and here it has|pg||
nt|rodal f: What happend:) Luckely 4@H is one of so a small loose by the misunderstanding|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|h2|pg||

nt|cliveo: I wonder what the difference was between 2 @S and 4 @S by Brunner|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 4@S logically has to be very long spades and hence a really big hand not to have just bid them first time|pg||
mb|1D|nt|ady: you mean after the 2@C from Holland?|pg||

mb|p|nt|Vugraphzgj: after confering with E, N changes his mind, +1 |pg||
nt|rodal f: Nice|pg||
mb|2S|nt|chick: they must superaccept with any 4 card support|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: the problem now is west still doesn't know if they have a club control|pg||
mb|3C|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 4@S denies a heart control, by the looks of it - but can 5@C be so far wrong? |pg||
nt|athene: given the state of the match i am surprised he didn't push further|pg||
nt|chick: I certainly wouldn't with a mediocre 15|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: would have to take right view in trumps and ruff finesse the hearts to make 12 tricks   |pg||
nt|athene: better to play 3NT as artificial there|pg||

nt|mcarroll: good lead|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|nt|golfsquash: The play will be quick.|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: now did they make 12 tricks here? shouldn't you lose @HA, @DQ? i guess there's a strip squeeze on west|pg||
nt|athene: *how did they|pg||
nt|chick: I'm told that 3@S is not a superaccept, but merely shows a minimum|pg||
nt|roswolf: a very routine hand now|pg||
nt|chick: they'll play this one in 3N though|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|rodal f: Still. More fun to comment now then the 1st half:)|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|athene: if they don't lead a heart you can finesse clubs, ruff club, run trumps and west goes arghhh|pg||
nt|cliveo: Declarer stripped the clubs and exited a heart after drawing trumps and West returned the @DQ|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: a heart lead will look scary, but defense can only get 4 tricks I think|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ady: if the hearet is not cashed   west could be squeezed with A@H and Q@D|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  1N is 14-16|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: the computer seems to think it is fun to have @Ss split 4-1 when there is a 4-4 fit - this is I think the third time in this match|pg||
nt|rodal f: A hurry from W after Es 2@H force?:(|pg||
nt|chick: 2NT asks 3@C may be weak or strong|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|kdr_fm: 4@c can make with the lucky lie of the cards.  2@c souldnt be a challeng|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: a very aggressive 2@S in the other room|pg||
nt|cliveo: West clearly was trying to defeat 5@S|pg||
nt|athene: unsurprisingly north got excited over that|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: They will get their 2 Aces in this contract|pg||

nt|athene: yes, there are three of them i think|pg||

mb|p|nt|chick: looks like 6@C on any lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|cliveo: In the Open Room declarer led the 9@c from the dummy creating a difficult problem for East|pg||
mb|1N|nt|chick: ouch,  I think E MUST bid|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  indeed. next great opportunity for NI|pg||
nt|chick: but E's pass will keep them from finding it|pg||

mb|2H|nt|sfoxa:  alas|pg||

pc|s2|nt|mdgraham: not sure - @CKQ are likely onside|pg||
nt|rodal f: Vug told me that Burns had his head in his hands for a while:)|pg||

nt|rodal f: Sr was E|pg||
nt|roswolf: but may /should lose a second club|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sJ|nt|chick: yep|pg||

nt|athene: 4@H isn't achieving anything - you know they are just going to bid 4@S and now you have given yourself a headache|pg||
nt|ady: yes    they should have casjed 2nd heart|pg||
nt|cliveo: precisely, the second @h had to be cashed|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  bidding after pre-empts is difficult all the time, must admit|pg||

nt|athene: north forgot to bid over 2@C, but he is vulnerable so maybe we forgive him|pg||
nt|rodal f: Any for re X from S|pg||
nt|rodal f: Bad @H for that but 20HP |pg||
nt|chick: they had some good chances|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: 2@S 15+ balanced or 4441,  4@D Texas (mild slam interest)|pg||

pc|dJ|nt|mdgraham: he forgot to double as well|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  @h start? giving some chances|pg||
pc|d3|pc|s4|nt|cliveo: It is not Holland's style to bid in these situations|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H   can be held to 10 tricks with a spade lead|pg||
pc|dK|nt|kdr_fm: good lead should lead to -1.  And even on other layouts - S might have the @Sq + @HA and be able to give a ruff anyway|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|hK|pg||

pc|s6|pc|s9|pc|s3|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  interesting possibility of throw-in (after cashing all side winners, when S retains @s K)|pg||
nt|chick: not sure he can manage to ruff a spade and still draw trumps in time.  would work if S had 4 clubs|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sJ|pc|h6|nt|sfoxa:  unreal to find at the table, like the unblocking of @s K too|pg||

pc|h4|nt|chick: spades would provide a ruff for the defense except no entry to S's hand after the A|pg||
