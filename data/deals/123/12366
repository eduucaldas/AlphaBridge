mb|1N|nt|Walddk2: As expected, Ireland and England a few miles ahead of the field at this point|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|jwit: Borderline 4H here.  Will not fetch with bad trump break|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: think its spades and a minor|pg||
nt|jwit: In fact 4H is down 2 with a diamond lead|pg||
mb|3D!|mb|3S|nt|capercliff: yes a @d ruff dooms a @h contract|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|jwit: Would be doomed even without the diamond ruff.  West has to score two trumps anyway|pg||
mb|d|nt|capercliff: whoever is managing the camrose site is doing a great job, very useful page |pg||
mb|p|nt|jwit: This should be doubled and is|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: 3@d showed 5+ H! (I think)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|capercliff: is a @h lead best here i wonder?|pg||
nt|capercliff: get the tap going|pg||

nt|yo_yo: 3NT looks ok too|pg||
nt|chick: I can hear W's thoughts .... pard bid 3@S freely without knowing about my solid diamonds :)|pg||
mb|1C|nt|garnetts: tough hand all round here par seems to be a save in 6@S |pg||
nt|roswolf: more overbidding in the other room - this time duly punished|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Walddk5: http://www.camrosebridge.com/  for a website with lots of useful information|pg||
mb|2H|nt|snetram: agressive again|pg||
mb|2S|mb|4H|nt|hedyg: NS play very weak weak|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Kvangraven is known to bid every time he has 13 cards|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hamilton likes that response|pg||
mb|4S|nt|marlowepi: the hand is not really worth an overcall followed by a double. but i like immediate double even less.|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Hi Marshall|pg||
nt|garnetts: I would have bid on the South hand--especially since partner has passed|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but i assume you would overcall|pg||
nt|chick: NS must be playing weak NTs, otherwise why didn't N open 1N|pg||
mb|p|nt|coch draig: 1N is forcing of course|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: There are possibilities to make this|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: 4@S is very pushy |pg||
nt|rodal f: 6-9 and 5@H+ I belive|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: best defense would be @C lead and 10@d by S|pg||
nt|snetram: i am not agree with 2@H opening. Bad bridge - A,K and weak suit ( 5332)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: some like a few point to overcall |pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: but that is totally DD|pg||
mb|p|pc|cJ|nt|mcarroll: and this lead helps|pg||
nt|rodal f: If A and @S|pg||
pc|c2|nt|garnetts: well done all round |pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
nt|roswolf: 2@H is bold and at least  east was under pressure and made the poor choice -a bit unlucky for the scots in this room|pg||
pc|c5|nt|Walddk2: Won't it just go 2 down with normal defence?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: silent opposition in the open room|pg||
nt|coch draig: nice auction|pg||
pc|c7|nt|garnetts: A@D and and an underlead will get maximum|pg||
pc|s8|pc|c6|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|Walddk2: Maybe not any more|pg||
nt|hedyg: not if gets to disc a @d on @H and ruff a @D|pg||
nt|athene: south didn't anticipate that declarer might have two heart tricks :) his partner has to have a pretty bad suit for that to happen :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: a bit risky|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d3|pc|dA|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgj: much thought from declarer|pg||
pc|sA|nt|snetram: Why E bid 4@S?|pg||
nt|hedyg: his turn to bid?|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not really |pg||
nt|rodal f: Done|pg||
nt|yo_yo: I'm a bit surprised Rex Anderson didnt support @S immediately|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|garnetts: what else |pg||
nt|mcarroll: well done|pg||
pc|s3|nt|yo_yo: i tried it recently and declarer's singleton King made|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|cK|nt|garnetts: one off rather than two |pg||
nt|yo_yo: better one down than making :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: but is off for sure--more risky if it might give the contract|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i hate that look on partner's face when it makes|pg||
nt|marlowepi: is that worse than the look on teammates faces?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgj: N closed board to ask east about W's pass in bidding|pg||
pc|sK|pc|c8|nt|Walddk2: Soft defence, but down it goes|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i dont blame him|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|hedyg: if you are going to play @d though i am sure 10@d is best|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgj: played from N when on table|pg||
nt|rodal f: brb|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but that must be their system|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|s6|nt|sfoxa:  forcing 1NT may include invitational hand with fit|pg||

nt|Vugraphzgj: N called director|pg||
mc|9|nt|yo_yo: i bet EW dont have an agreement about pass|pg||
nt|garnetts: Seems typical of bridge today---make your guess and get on with it---why ask what pass means --you can bet it is encouraging a slam |pg||
nt|Vugraphzgj: W says it was showing 1 keycard, @HK|pg||
nt|roswolf: a useful gain for the scots|pg||

mb|1D|mb|d|nt|jwit: with a heart lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|Walddk2: Is this hand too good for a 1NT overcall vulnerable?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Maybe a tad|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|jwit: Slightly with good diamond spots and fifth diamond in my opinion Roland|pg||
nt|capercliff: but do you downgrade the 5th @h when opp open them first?|pg||
nt|jwit: If North had a second diamond, 3NT would make|pg||
nt|capercliff: 5th @d rather|pg||
nt|jwit: I wouldn't downgrade it because of good spots.  As I say, give partner a second diamond, and 3NT is making|pg||
nt|capercliff: for just that reason Jon, partner is very likely to be short|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He is not down yet|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I know the defence has a couple of chances to play hearts but they might not|pg||
nt|jwit: 4S actually has a chance to make on Moysian|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|capercliff: N showing 5-4, but 3N is a practical shot|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If Hamilton leads @D4, it can be difficult for Ferguson to read|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and he may continue diamonds|pg||
pc|h5|nt|jwit: No chance now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now the defensive troubles are over|pg||
nt|capercliff: and the auction may suggest S has double @h stop?|pg||
nt|capercliff: W knows that @s are alomost certain to be 4333 around the table|pg||

nt|Walddk2: First you have to bid 3NT, and then make it|pg||
nt|chick: but still a 2-point spread|pg||
nt|garnetts: so what--he wants to have his cake and eat it|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ah it was DOPI|pg||
nt|yo_yo: pass showing 1 key card|pg||
nt|marlowepi: seems odd that internationalists would not have an agreement about handling interference over 4N. is this a new partnership or something?|pg||
nt|coch draig: immediate raises are pre-emptive i believe|pg||
nt|yo_yo: they are a very experienced pairing  so I guess it's all covered|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Rex Anderson has been playing Camrose bridge for ....  ever|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|garnetts: Like much of what I see today--in my view if North wants an adjustment he should employ a chiropractor|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: i wouldnt have an agreement about the final pass  but yes over 4NT  |pg||
nt|yo_yo: Shields and Denning seem to have been around for a long time, is that right Mark?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|yo_yo: he's gone for tea :)|pg||

nt|Walddk7: http://www.camrosebridge.com/  for standings, convention cards and other useful information|pg||
nt|roswolf: south's silence is strange|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgj: beaUTIFUL SAID DECL!|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|nt|garnetts: Good lead for declarer here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i doubt thatthe final pass was the issue|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgj: S thought for some time before pass|pg||
nt|roswolf: apparently X Shows clubs vs14-16+ which is why south didnt bid|pg||
pc|d3|nt|garnetts: close between small and the Q |pg||
nt|mcarroll: at least they avoided the 4-4 @S fit|pg||
pc|d4|nt|hedyg: 1NT is a constructive bid|pg||
pc|h3|nt|chick: I think only 8 tricks for NS, so probably best he chose to defend|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h8|nt|snetram: NS pay at least 500 in any contract|pg||
nt|athene: surprising to pass 2nt there with two aces and two potentially useful tens|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: after his 4@S last board|pg||
nt|hedyg: he already bid his hand when he bid 1NT|pg||
nt|yo_yo: any photos mark?|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|athene: north dodged a bullet, doubling rather than overcalling 1nt - that might have led to a lot of trouble for NS|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I suppose this happens when you open a featureless 11 count|pg||
pc|hA|nt|hedyg: 1NT should show 8-10|pg||
nt|chick: both tens are in suits that W doesn't have, so they may not be worth much|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  quite a rare occasion to play on 1st level, but EW have no power to compete and NS have no game|pg||
pc|h5|nt|chick: same with the length in @Ds|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|roswolf: will he find the club switch|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|nt|rodal f: Norwegian specs will tell me if I'm wrong. Belive it's still 6 cup rounds before the final are to be played. At 3rd round the best teams play there first cup match. |pg||
nt|athene: i would say both tens are working quite hard|pg||
nt|chick: he has almost nothing to help set up tricks in W's suits|pg||
nt|athene: give partner nothing in diamonds and just the jack in spades for instance|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c2|pg||
nt|athene: @S10 and @D10 both help to give you a double stopper|pg||
nt|coch draig: photos letts see...|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|yo_yo: agree  Denning made a good? decision not to go on|pg||
nt|yo_yo: mind you next time they might miss game|pg||

pc|c9|nt|snetram: typical auction - 1@S - X -pas - 2@D - X - pas...|pg||
nt|garnetts: odd play surely |pg||

pc|d2|pc|dJ|pc|d7|pg||
nt|jwit: I think it's close Cliff.  Just needed partner to have a little distribution to have a chance|pg||
nt|capercliff: what was Burn saying earlier about VUL?|pg||
nt|capercliff: forcing to game|pg||
nt|jwit: I wouldn't go that far, but certainly tips the scales on close hands|pg||
nt|capercliff: i wonder if the E/W have other ways to show a 4-card raise|pg||
nt|capercliff: or if 1N is forcing?|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  if 1@s is limited (let's say up to 15 point) - the danger isn't big|pg||

nt|Vugraphzgj: sorry guys - players have B4 on table|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgj: so we'll just have to wait for B3 - and i'll have to work out how to put in contract and score for B4 later|pg||
nt|coch draig: obviously some kind of delay at the table|pg||
nt|yo_yo: any specs got pics online of Anderson or Denning  ( not many to ask)|pg||
nt|coch draig: more info about Denning / Shields from somebody much older than me obviously,   Pat and Paul won Junior tials in 1976; they were added to the senior trial when one pair dropped ...|pg||
nt|coch draig: out, and they won that too,and played in the Camrose in 1977|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgj: West is declarer here, but not sure of contract - they confused me!|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it's not easy Julia|pg||
nt|yo_yo: I know, I did vugraph myself recently|pg||
nt|yo_yo: awful trying to peer across the table to see if they play @D 2 or @D3|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgj: yes - i need new glasses!|pg||
nt|yo_yo: and if they play fast you are gone!|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  would you ask the dummy? about contract and result|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgj: yes - once finished |pg||
nt|coch draig: 4@s +1 by West appears to be the likely result|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i did ask actually, but they dont like it|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  yes, I know it well too )))|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgj: they playing B4 - i think it may be 1N by W, but will confirm|pg||

nt|yo_yo: put on my schoolteacher voice|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgj: yes - it was 1N by west up 2 for B4|pg||
nt|coch draig: so what happened on B3?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it coming up now presumably|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  we will see B3|pg||

mb|4S|nt|garnetts: Not sure how good it is as a %age|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ok laydown at trick 3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: depends on lead as to how good it is. diamond leads hurts the a priori %|pg||
nt|yo_yo: simpson is treading carefully here, no  jump to 2@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzgj: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: you put the jack in right away to find if the finesse is on|pg||

nt|yo_yo: isnt there a trophy for the winner of Scotland vs NI?|pg||

nt|yo_yo: that sounds great (if it means that )|pg||
pc|d5|nt|athene: you don't want to run it round to the ace and then finesse because if it lost opps could cash and you would be worse off|pg||

nt|coch draig: 1N is natural and game forcing|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgj: players at all tables being asked not to speak explanations of bids - must write them - so i'm afraid i can't see details - sorry|pg||
mb|2D|nt|yo_yo: thanks Julia|pg||
nt|coch draig: no worries we'll wing it|pg||
nt|yo_yo: some players actually pass explanations to the vugraph operators|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgj: one player warned if he spoke number of tricks again then director may fine, so all being well behaved!|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: he had 15 hcps and a good 6 card suit|pg||

nt|yo_yo: i hope they know what they are doing|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: Me too although it might well backfire this time as EW might have goot too high in spades |pg||

mb|p|nt|copeyj: yes but N/S might make 3@C :)|pg||

nt|garnetts: Ragardless of the inadequacy of my 2@S bid|pg||
nt|marlowepi: many pairs play transfers over a double, which allows W to show his long hearts and then make a spade-tolerance raise|pg||
nt|marlowepi: thus showing everything, and in an accurate context|pg||
nt|copeyj: i dont know abt that with the W hand marshall - i mean it shows a better hand than this|pg||

mb|2N|nt|Walddk7: Another term stolen from cricket, as is the case for hat-trick|pg||

mb|4S|nt|jwit: what was 2D all about?  Seems like an easy 2H bid|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Last board of the set now. Many thanks to Dee Harley, our splendid operator at Edinburgh. Well done again!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Also thanks to my excellent fellow commentators: Jon Wittes and Cliff Gillis|pg||
nt|capercliff: 2@c maybe shows @d and a fit?|pg||
nt|jwit: I would have thought 2C would just have been a limit raise or better|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|capercliff: 2@d was also alerted|pg||

mb|1D!|nt|Walddk2: *around|pg||
nt|yo_yo: you mean after the night before?|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|yo_yo: that bidding may not be correct, i think the operator is concentrating on the results|pg||
nt|athene: this is the last board from previous set so we are getting there :)|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Exactly what can happen when you don't split the files into two of 16|pg||
nt|Walddk7: We emphasize that in our guidelines|pg||
nt|cliveo: That's right, the board was played in 3 @S +1 for a flat board|pg||
nt|athene: i see in the other room NIBU has changed their pair; certainly they had a rough time last set, letting through a few too many no-play contracts|pg||
nt|po-s: it increases the chances to find the right contracts|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Stuart, you may as well shut down. This leads to no good|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Fine the person who is in charge and let him/her sort it out|pg||
nt|Walddk7: >Nothing can be done with the table up|pg||

mb|p|mb|4S|nt|yo_yo: yes you are right, simpson with look favourably upon his @CK|pg||
nt|yo_yo: and the @H finesse|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Here, too, coded @S lead (J denies) might let EW find the winning defense|pg||
nt|garnetts: Well I must say that I find double unbelievable unless it has a hidden meaning |pg||
nt|coch draig: wb all sry about that|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Bill Frisby and Marianne Harding|pg||
nt|marlowepi: e|pg||
nt|yo_yo: you prefer a @S overcall?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3C imprudent, could easily have pushed them there|pg||
nt|rodal f: Can u explain 1@H Stuart?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Transfer - shows @S|pg||
nt|rodal f: Thx Martin:)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i was just googling Belarus,  my ignorance is such I have never heard of it, it must be cold there too :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: lead  ok  but I dont like 4/3 fits|pg||

pc|cA|nt|yo_yo: well, the second team is forging ahead|pg||

pc|d9|nt|garnetts: Yes by a lot actually |pg||
nt|yo_yo: sounds awful  sveta|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|yo_yo: I prefer the overcall myself but there's support for all the unbid suits  so ok|pg||
nt|roswolf: east also bid 3@S on nothing|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cT|nt|sfoxa:  matter of habit, Kath|pg||
nt|yo_yo: cant you move?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  not this year - right now we have -3 only - looks like Grand Daddy Frost relocated to GB this year|pg||
pc|s3|nt|snetram: not very nice partscore for NS|pg||
nt|athene: it could be worse - could be doubled|pg||
nt|rodal f: A naturell X and 2NT lebensol|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|hK|nt|snetram: right - passive pass by E|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|pc|h5|pg||
nt|athene: east was quite kind i think - his partner has to have something for 2@H vul against not |pg||
pc|hA|nt|mcarroll: This is not going to be a success|pg||
pc|s2|nt|garnetts: You can always back in later if it feels prudent|pg||
pc|h7|nt|athene: people often don't double with a very big trump stack because they are scared opps will run to a better spot|pg||
nt|athene: but that isn't much of a danger here|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
