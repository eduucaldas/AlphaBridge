nt|mmmakela: rehi all! easy 6 @H to start with|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: Eliasson will get a nice surprise as his partner opens the bidding with 1@H :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: hmm 7 maybe?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: Good Morning everyone and welcome back to Linköping and the final rounds of the swedish premier league. We will follow the outcome of the match between BK Lyx and Örebridgen, both ...|pg||

mb|p|nt|kaapo: Nope|pg||

nt|kaapo: Swedes love strong or 2-way club|pg||
nt|col3435: some well-fitting cards here|pg||
mb|3H|nt|mmmakela: bridge is one of the few sports where playing home is not that great an advantage|pg||

nt|Walddk4: and Kari Patana|pg||

mb|p|nt|kaapo: Hejssan :)|pg||
nt|joemanjo: Hi Vladimir|pg||
mb|p|pc|d9|nt|mmmakela: N has a rotten rdbl hand|pg||
nt|kaapo: Hejssan alla|pg||
nt|joemanjo: This looks like a West Bengal vs Delhi match. NS and EW respectively.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|varange: welcome to the Swedish Premier League.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|kaapo: 1NT is about 17-19 here I suppose|pg||
nt|col3435: at least declarer has something to think about on this lead|pg||
nt|varange: NS played pretty slowly during the previous session|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|c2|nt|kaapo: Straightforward bidding|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  Hello, Markku. Good evening to all|pg||
nt|kaapo: Did 3NT show clubs or @S shortness or something else?|pg||
pc|c5|nt|varange: which meant that the OR caught up|pg||
nt|kaapo: 1NT = clubs or GF relay?|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|sfoxa:  Hello, Kari.|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 3433 and 9 with no intermeds|pg||
nt|mcphee: 3nt a nice spot|pg||
nt|xenya: good stop but still an awkward contract|pg||
pc|c4|nt|kaapo: Hi Cornelia, Markku and Staffan|pg||
nt|chick: hard to pass with 2 aces though|pg||
nt|chick: and a lively first round of bidding dies quite suddenly|pg||
nt|rnc: For Running Scores, time schedule etc during the tournament: http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_plugins/content/content.php?content.877|pg||
nt|kaapo: Hi|pg||
nt|mmmakela: only guess who might have all 3 trumps|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: short @S and not min|pg||
pc|c3|nt|chick: now that E sees that he set up the spades, he has to start grabbing tricks before losers can be pitched|pg||
nt|kaapo: Clubs will easily bring enough tricks for EW and luckily South hasn't got too high a heart in order to get a chance to play twice through West|pg||
nt|chick: with no entries, N must try to get to partner's hand again for another @H through|pg||
nt|col3435: if East is showing his shape this could turn out well|pg||
nt|kaapo: Ten tricks on top and 2 diamond ruffs bring it to twelve. 4-0 clubs shouldn't do much harm|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|joemanjo: Both sides play Standard with variations|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|burypies: tajemnicza 8@d|pg||
nt|kaapo: Hopefully 4@H was alerted too :)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|kaapo: Or are they playing with screens?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mmmakela: needs C A right here for starters,now might even make this akward contract|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|kaapo: North might have some slam ambitions, if there are no wasted @S values|pg||
nt|rnc: For Running Scores, time schedule etc during the tournament: http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_plugins/content/content.php?content.877|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: north has shown 1-4 in majors with 5+@D here|pg||
nt|kaapo: Tack, Staffan|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|mcphee: all over now|pg||
nt|varange: Ralf Willquist will be able to fill us in on most of the play as he knows the players|pg||
nt|varange: and our operator at the venue, Steffan, will keep us updated|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a big mistake to reach 6@s here. -2 if they can find the @c ruff on NS|pg||
pc|h2|nt|burypies: Weijknis wiedzia³ ze 2! to dwukolorówka?|pg||
nt|burypies: 2@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzbf: tak wyjanione przed wistem|pg||
nt|burypies: je¿eli tak powinien zagraæ D@d|pg||
nt|burypies: wiedzia³ ¿e  rozgrywaj¹cy ma singla @d|pg||
nt|kaapo: I believe NS play 2-way club. North would open 1@C with 11-13 balanced, so he has kind of maximum|pg||
nt|mmmakela: I surely would because now 1 @S was forcing in my book and he passed!|pg||
nt|kaapo: I tried commentating in Swedish too, but my typing was a bit too slow in that language. I might do better now that PO is playing, though ;)|pg||
nt|varange: should be bid - ask Roland :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: I doubt even Roland would approve of this one :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: no screens, no alert since swedish rules say no alerting above 3nt|pg||
pc|hT|nt|kaapo: Ok, then no alerts beyond 3NT|pg||
nt|col3435: opps had probably got the idea by that point anyway :)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|kaapo: A kib suggests that 4@H was RKC in clubs|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|varange: what systems do they play Ralf?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree Staffan!|pg||
nt|joemanjo: North may be AshiM Mukherjee - if so he is a player in the Indian Railways B team.|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sA|nt|col3435: mm. So presumably 3@h showed 4414 exactly|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|pg||
nt|xenya: should make with a careful play though, and he is on the right track|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s7|nt|col3435: easy with spades breaking - but how would you play if South had five?|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s3|pg||
nt|ralfwil: strong @c from both pairs  - Staffan?|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ralfwil: EW does and I thing NS too|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: yes, strong club, 17+, from both as far as i can see|pg||
nt|kaapo: The web site for the tournament is here http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_plugins/content/content.php?content.877|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|kaapo: You'll find running scores there too|pg||
nt|xenya: now another trump and @C hook |pg||
nt|xenya: but this line fails -- |pg||
nt|xenya: not clear why he decided to shorten himself in trumps, losing control|pg||

nt|vugraphzpx: i would say they are pretty good, noone knows how good he is in a speedy :) I can ask him though... :)|pg||
nt|chick: Hello Everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: if south has 5 spades, the best way must be to play the 8 of clubs and let it go round to north|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: or even a small one|pg||
nt|col3435: yes that's nice|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: nice 4@H contract here|pg||
nt|kaapo: Rehi Cornelia|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  hello, Cornelia|pg||
nt|kaapo: 1NT looks interesting|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 1 nt seems needing swings|pg||
nt|kaapo: What does that show, then? :)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  if E decided to open 1nt, good ending could be 3nt |pg||
nt|kaapo: 10-13, might be off-shap?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  guess @d right - "only"|pg||
nt|joemanjo: What wd u open as North?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kaapo: Well, no need to interfere with his play :)|pg||
nt|frankaus: g'day all|pg||
nt|kaapo: North may get to open here, unless West finds 1@H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@C|pg||
nt|joemanjo: :)|pg||
mb|2C|an| |nt|mcphee: need to reach 5@D |pg||
nt|chick: is he known as a particularly slow player?  :)|pg||
nt|xenya: the 3@D preempt in the other room was overdoing it|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|varange: hi Frank|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: I suppose Johan and PO at least play 2-way club|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: chick, sundelin is known as one of the slowest swedish players ever... :)|pg||
mb|2N|an| |nt|mmmakela: N won't sell|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: 2-way club, where 1@C shows either a strong hand or a weak notrump range, is often referred to as Swedish club|pg||
nt|joemanjo: 2@C and 2N take up valuable space to show a black two suiter.|pg||
mb|3C|an| |mb|p|nt|mmmakela: 14-16 Nt maybe?|pg||
nt|chick: certainly doesn't look like a hand that I would upgrade|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: 13-17NT from start, 2@D showed 13-15 without 4c major|pg||
nt|chick: :)|pg||
nt|mcphee: PO thinks his partners minor is @C:)|pg||
nt|chick: good thing I don't have a lot to do today then :)|pg||
mb|3S|an| |nt|kaapo: I guess 1NT = 14-16|pg||
nt|kaapo: Some might bid some number of diamonds as West|pg||
nt|kaapo: Even if East doesn't lead a club, he'll get another chance|pg||
nt|kaapo: Unless he ducks a spade|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: this board is wrong duplicated. Not much, but the ace of heart is located at east, not at south|pg||
nt|kaapo: Makes a little more sense then|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  single?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: south stole the 9 of D from east|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: so east holds 3253 with A7 in hearts|pg||
nt|kaapo: Mikael and Cilla are in the minority for Swedish experts: they don't play strong/2-way club|pg||
nt|kaapo: Their system of choice is short club with transfers|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: @D lead would have proved troublesome|pg||
nt|xenya: well if he decided to treat has hand as balanced, it makes sense|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|xenya: whether it is balanced is doubtful though|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|chick: almost any lead gives away a trick|pg||
mb|5D|nt|kaapo: Well, unless the other room plays the board similarly distorted, this has to be canceled|pg||
nt|mmmakela: so S has 10982 in dias?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: it´s the same at all other tables.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: yes, south holds 10982 in @d|pg||
mb|p|nt|jkmjanusz: Witam!|pg||
nt|vugraphzbf: witamy nowych komentatorów |pg||
nt|abunio: witamy z Gdanska :)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: ns play 2-way club Staffan? Carrot?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: 2@C asking for majors, 2@D relay with lots of different hands, 2@H/2@S/2NT/3@C/3@D invitational|pg||
nt|chick: and N puts him to the test immediately, before he can get any other info|pg||
nt|kaapo: Of couse he does have @DQ and might get a trick with it|pg||
nt|chick: but N still has to find the @DQ|pg||
nt|mcphee: sure, nice bold play before anyones knows what is up|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6@C makes but it's not great. It takes more than the heart finesse|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|varange: choices choices|pg||
nt|xenya: all S's honours work and he knows it|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: @H8 looked discouraging|pg||
nt|chick: club switch still isn't clear though|pg||
pc|h4|nt|sfoxa:  so, we'll be unable to follow the play right - just enter result? |pg||
nt|kaapo: This seems to happen rarely but occasionally with the duplicating machines|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: we can follow the play as long as they wont play hearts... :)|pg||
nt|kaapo: In Beijing we had a normal bidding sequence and I ended up at 3NT|pg||
nt|mmmakela: we can until certain point but did S really pitch a dia|pg||
nt|kaapo: When I examined the dummy, I noticed our side had two diamond queens!|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: yes, south did pitch the 2 of @d|pg||
nt|mmmakela: very strange|pg||
nt|frankaus: still makes with 3@H 3@C 2@S + 1@D|pg||
nt|col3435: I guess you finish drawing trumps and try to cash some clubs, but when that doesn't work, what do you do?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Besides, if declarer is not careful, he may go down|pg||
pc|h2|nt|chick: now should just lose the top trumps|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|pg||
nt|kaapo: It may get dangerous now, if he finesses trumps|pg||
nt|kaapo: Some also play Smith echo in the suit declarer first attacks (if count isn't relevant). If that's the case, @D2 might suggest finding another suit, too|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Must ruff one spade low and one high|pg||
nt|xenya: i think it's basically on a @H finesse -- barring something really bad in trumps or @Hs|pg||
pc|h7|nt|mcphee: going to be a costly misguess sadly|pg||
pc|hK|nt|col3435: ruff the club out and play for the @dA to be right?|pg||
pc|h8|nt|kaapo: Hmm, he attacked @S first :)|pg||
nt|varange: oops|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|kaapo: On the other hand he seems to be home now if trumps are 3-2|pg||
nt|chick: one more round of trump, then set up clubs?|pg||
nt|col3435: of course you can get away with anything as the cards lie|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ralfwil: I had prefered to signal for a @d shift by playing @s10|pg||
nt|kaapo: Yes, black suits were a bit bad but anything else is right|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s5|pc|s3|pg||
nt|kaapo: Seems a reasonable plan|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mmmakela: and a heart maybe|pg||
pc|s8|pc|c5|nt|chick: needed to take his pitches on the minor winners before another trump|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Sorry, he can ruff two low|pg||
mc|12|nt|mmmakela: well playing o/e 1st discard had no other convinient card I suppose but still bad|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But if spades were 6-2, that would fail|pg||

nt|kaapo: They didn't, and neither did the open room|pg||
nt|frankaus: well not real garbagge and not short in @C so i would not  use it here|pg||
nt|varange: yep|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes! 1nt is good enough|pg||
nt|varange: Burns' Law: As declarer, one should strive to have more trumps than one's opponents|pg||
nt|varange: in some ways easier if playing the big 2NT, SAYC style|pg||
nt|xenya: if E is weak, he can take remove to 3@S -- the position is quite clear adter W's initial pass |pg||
pc|s5|pc|sJ|nt|burypies: ale Witek im namiesza³ |pg||

pc|sQ|pc|s2|pg||
nt|chick: not sure I would have led a trump on that auction|pg||
pc|s9|nt|kaapo: Without the double, North would bid 1@D to show 0-7. Difficult to tell what 1@S shows here|pg||

nt|kaapo: Loser on loser play on the next spade?|pg||

nt|kaapo: Hi Yuval|pg||
nt|col3435: yeah, why not @sJ and run it if West follows low|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|chick: W might Q-ask |pg||
nt|kaapo: In case I was about right about the early bids, 3@H could be a re-tranafer and 3NT some kind of slam try follows by two cue bids|pg||
nt|kaapo: Fredin - Lindkvist had an even more straightforward sequence to 7@H|pg||
nt|col3435: but here west shows out, and if he allows the @h7 to score it's all over|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: west has the option of discarding 2 diamonds on the 3rd and 4th round of spade, denying the 6of H to score|pg||

pc|s3|nt|ryskiel_: moimi prywatnymi faworytami s¹ licytacje sprzedajace te same walory po kilkakroæ|pg||

nt|kaapo: Apparently not much :)|pg||
nt|kaapo: So pitching a club here looks a reasonable plan|pg||
nt|yuval10: indeed|pg||

nt|varange: it even makes 13 with a 3/2 break in diamonds|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Lucky layout for N-S in a spade contract. They can take 9 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Maybe even 10|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: 4@S or 3NT here?|pg||
nt|kaapo: NS might end up at 4@H here|pg||
nt|mcphee: easy @S game, interesting to see how far N/S will push|pg||
nt|kaapo: 6@S could make but is missing two key cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: 4@H will look tasty to NS, but also to W |pg||
nt|ralfwil: first morning slam in @d|pg||
nt|col3435: perhaps South could bid 4@d over 3NT then.|pg||

nt|kaapo: Ah, weren't we linked with the other table before?|pg||

nt|yuval10: or perhaps 2@s from N|pg||
mb|p|nt|varange: and hearts|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|kaapo: Unlikely they'd get that high, though, unless really pushed|pg||
nt|mcphee: does the 2@S bid show game interest for @H?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: 2@S was pass/correct. |pg||
mb|2S|nt|kaapo: 1@D, I believe, shows about 11-16 with 4+@D and an unbalanced hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: N will expect partner to have @s singleton|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: 10-15 actually|pg||
nt|mcphee: or just an invitation + for @H?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes, but @d is better|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: supp dbl in spades|pg||
nt|chick: do you suppose 1@H is transfer advance showing spades?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: y|pg||
nt|kaapo: Nyström made a slight overbid with 4@D, but his @DAQ had grown in strength over 3@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: Wrang explained the 4@D wrong it seems, 4@D showed game forcing without short D|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: with spade support of course|pg||
nt|kaapo: 2@D Multi, showing a weak two in either of the majors (or perhaps some strong hand)|pg||
mb|p|pc|h6|nt|kaapo: Ok, some downgrading due to singleton J|pg||
nt|mmmakela: brb cig br|pg||

pc|c3|nt|vugraphzpx: 4@H showed a good raise to 4@S|pg||
nt|kaapo: Perhaps West could bid a minor suit to suggest a maximum with hearts?|pg||
nt|kaapo: 8 teams remain in the top division so there's lot to play for even for Örebridgen. They're currently 6th, 4.5 VPs ahead of the 8th positioned team|pg||

nt|joemanjo: That lead is good. Now 10 wll be difficult.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In the other room, West doubled 2@S and his poor partner is now in 2NT, mercifully undoubled|pg||

pc|dK|nt|jkmjanusz: Po przepuszczeniu @H Damy Kasprzak zmieni³ wista na @S !!|pg||
nt|kaapo: Apparently 2@H was a simple reverse, a little light but with nice 3-card support for partner and great controls|pg||
nt|kaapo: Diamond split is very cruel, in case they end up at some number of dimonds|pg||
nt|kaapo: What is the 1NT range here, Staffan?|pg||
nt|frankaus: 2@H will make so no real harm|pg||
nt|varange: the one is as good as the other?|pg||
pc|d5|nt|chick: not necessarily a pause... remember the operator cannot enter bids until both people on one side of the screen have bid|pg||
nt|varange: friendly breaks either way|pg||
nt|yuval10: if he guess it that would be something :)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|kaapo: 14-16?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: not sure, 14-16 or 15-17|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|abunio: raz tez Misiak umozliwil piekna rozgrywke, ale na pewno niebyl to blad prosty|pg||
nt|mmmakela: if Lebens this promises values(3@C)|pg||
nt|mcphee: they blew n/s out of 3N|pg||
nt|mmmakela: still wd EW|pg||
nt|varange: you'd open the south hand 1@s Frank?|pg||
nt|varange: or 1NT?|pg||
nt|frankaus: many here include 5M332 in their NT range - klinger has  a great influence here a he recomends it|pg||
nt|xenya: but this is very double dummy|pg||
pc|c2|nt|chick: that's one advantage of not bidding clubs, don't give away the bad distribution|pg||
nt|kaapo: Of course would be more cruel still, if South had them|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: they play lebensohl|pg||
nt|chick: if it promises clubs, that's ok with N|pg||
nt|mcphee: :)|pg||
nt|chick: but with a nice heart fit, it is trouble, double or not|pg||
pc|cA|nt|arvid: If east had the jack of diamonds 6@D would have been a very good slam|pg||
nt|kaapo: Wrang saw short clubs with partner and opts for the 4-3 @S game|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: We had a lost connection at the other table which means board  15 isnt scored properly. The result in the open room was 6@S made, which should give another 14imps for Team Zang|pg||
nt|chick: he must win the @SA, so can ruff two clubs with the small trumps|pg||
nt|mmmakela: making 13|pg||
nt|yuval10: either way EW can make 10 tricks in @h because of the 87 doubleton @d so -1 in 4@s isn't so bad|pg||
nt|joemanjo: yes, missed the qj of clubs|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mmmakela: so then very nice auction|pg||
nt|frankaus: will be nervous about the @D situation|pg||
nt|varange: the 8@h is a big card|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|varange: AQxxx isn't that flash anyway|pg||
nt|frankaus: yes  then i play garbage 2@C and puppet 3@C for all game going hands|pg||
nt|varange: ok|pg||
nt|varange: nice treatment|pg||
nt|col3435: can East just continue hearts here?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: yes he can|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mmmakela: well S never thinks with his 10-12.....|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: there are no screens |pg||
nt|mmmakela: against 2-way club most treat it as supposing the weak variation and W didn't bid after 1 @C so has clubs now if thinking one could assume|pg||
nt|mmmakela: even that was meant priv sry|pg||
pc|s6|nt|burypies: a przeciwnicy siê szarpi¹ |pg||
nt|kaapo: How do you like 2@D (either direct or in the pass out seat)?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|kaapo: PO Sundelin in deep thought in the other room playing 4@S on board 3|pg||

nt|kaapo: Ah yes, Tommy seems to have dropped at some point. I'm sure he'll enter the score at some convenient point|pg||
nt|chick: commentators curse strikes again |pg||
nt|ralfwil: ???|pg||
pc|c6|nt|mmmakela: S can discard it on 3rd C(DQ)|pg||
nt|varange: keyboard stuck?|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mcphee: very risky|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cT|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: 7 and K is pretty far from eachother... |pg||

nt|frankaus: need to go soon  - dinner time here tu for your company|pg||
nt|varange: thanks Frank|pg||
nt|varange: what's for dinner?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I just calculate when @c7 is a corrrect play - never as I see it|pg||
nt|varange: ah OK|pg||
nt|frankaus: sunday is not epicurian - quice + frankfurt|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d8|nt|col3435: that would take some good guessing too :)|pg||

nt|kaapo: Our first IMPs went to Näsby for defeating 2@S on board 2|pg||
nt|kaapo: Thinking about singleton kings again?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: for the kibs asking if S had 0-6 points with clubs he would bid 2 NT to ask pd bid 3 @C with normal t/o hand|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mcphee: i think PO should have been more aggresive and returned @D J|pg||

nt|chick: looks like we have lost some scores from the movie, but I'll bet our superb operators will get that fixed when they have the time|pg||

nt|kaapo: Ever played Speedy Gonzales at some Swedish junior camp, Staffan?|pg||
nt|kaapo: Where will this end?|pg||
nt|joemanjo: I wonder where this will end. 3N or 5C? |pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: 3NT seems an interesting choice - I was thinking about 2NT or 4NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: E was about to bid spades, so now will he try his diamonds, or will he hide in the bushes and ambush a spade contract?|pg||
nt|chick: 2N obviously for the minors, not what N wanted to hear|pg||
nt|chick: and S violates rule  1 of preempts .... don't bid again unless forced.   But with 6-6, I can see the temptation|pg||
nt|kaapo: In the end, PO went one down and lost 12 IMPs|pg||
nt|varange: and made 10 tricks|pg||
nt|kaapo: Opening 4@S looks right|pg||
nt|col3435: agree|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: 3NT perhaps|pg||
nt|mcphee: too hi in everything I thinnk:)|pg||
nt|mcphee: good thing about this hand is they are not going to get dbled in 3N|pg||
nt|col3435: quick 4@s here then|pg||
nt|varange: that 4NT+2 got them 11 imps; 7@d-1 at the other table|pg||
nt|joemanjo: East has an easy defense if he starts off with @h honour|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hJ|nt|joemanjo: 2 down without breathing hard and more if declarer discards wrong.|pg||
nt|xenya: i don't like 1@D opening, but perhaps it's forced if you are not prepared to support  1@S response|pg||
pc|h2|nt|burypies: 1@s by³by w stylu Darlesu:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzbf: zasuwaj¹ tak, ¿ebym nie nad¹¿y³...|pg||
nt|kaapo: I might open 4NT if that shows both minors too|pg||
nt|chick: 2@C probably a precision-like bid showing 5-6 clubs and a 4 card major|pg||
nt|varange: one of our specs is having confit du canard - hmmmm, yummy|pg||
nt|ralfwil: perhaps best lead. declarer has to do all the work himself|pg||
nt|varange: yep|pg||
nt|varange: nice and neutral|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|mmmakela: Lebensohl is a very good gimmick that can be used in many various situations|pg||
nt|mmmakela: really like this?|pg||
nt|kaapo: 2 down on a @C ruff|pg||
nt|frankaus: 5@D X will be a poor compensation for NS|pg||
nt|col3435: ah, the danger of bidding grands|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: yes, the players at the other table knew about the 6-2 in @d and bid 7. Bridge isnt fair... :)|pg||
nt|varange: dontcha hate it when underbids get the imps?|pg||
pc|c9|nt|chick: It's a nearly perfect fit NS, and neither one knows about the other's singleton|pg||

nt|kaapo: The idea in a Speedy Gonzales bridge competition is that there's only a ridiculously short time per board to play|pg||

nt|kaapo: Or perhaps a transfer to clubs|pg||
nt|mcphee: 10@S I mean|pg||
mb|3H|nt|mmmakela: would you show majs or treat S hand as 1-suiter|pg||
nt|xenya: strange pass by S|pg||
mb|3S|nt|varange: can you explain Ralf?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: and direct 3 @C promising pos values|pg||
nt|chick: "transfer" implies that you have the suit.   in this case, it's more like a "relay" to clubs, with many possible hands|pg||
nt|kaapo: East had a very maximal hand and support for whatever suit West has and tries for game|pg||
nt|mmmakela: tries?|pg||
nt|kaapo: True, Cornelia, but many play real transfers in this position|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: East though seems unaware of that his partner has made a lebensohl bid |pg||
nt|kaapo: Your using keyboard input, Staffan?|pg||
nt|kaapo: *You're|pg||
nt|frankaus: nil vul is not so good to preempt|pg||

mb|p|nt|abunio: sorry, private|pg||

mb|p|nt|jkmjanusz: A ³adsna? Warto dzwoniæ?|pg||
nt|chick: in competitive bidding, I think need to give as many options to partner as you can|pg||
nt|kaapo: 800 may have been very expensive, because EW's 4@S didn't seem easy at all|pg||
nt|kaapo: 1@C strong - 1@D weak|pg||

nt|col3435: very much so :)|pg||
nt|col3435: nice though|pg||
nt|varange: yes|pg||
nt|xenya: double showed @Hs -- it would seem natural to bid your @S at that point|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|chick: ok, but that's not lebensohl (for the benefit of kibs)|pg||
nt|kaapo: Yes, good to make the distinction clear|pg||
nt|mmmakela: not true Kaapo, most play leb here|pg||
nt|mcphee: this game may go down|pg||
nt|kaapo: As you see, D and S are adjacent on the keyboard. Easy to make "typos" if using keyboard input when operating :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: yeah, and all 13 cards are next to eachother so it´s easy to have a "clickos" for that :)|pg||
nt|mcphee: @C lead bad for the N hand|pg||
nt|kaapo: Well, you've been doing marvellously well :)|pg||
nt|varange: :) dang|pg||
nt|ralfwil: perhaps some kind of transfer|pg||
nt|varange: it seems that way|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: no alert on 1NT at least so I dont think they play it as transfer|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mmmakela: N likes the lead but...|pg||
nt|col3435: good prediction - spade lead didn't look clear to me|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|chick: as long as EW cash their minor winners, this cannot make|pg||
nt|kaapo: Some might use Lebensohl here. If it's in use, then South's 3@D shows some values; he'd bid 2NT with a very weak hand|pg||
nt|varange: wow|pg||
pc|d7|nt|mmmakela: I hate playing in 4-2 when 6-1 was available(ok extreme case but 4-3 is probable)|pg||

pc|d3|pg||
nt|chick: often opponents will compete, taking partner off the hook|pg||
nt|mmmakela: so 1-suiter for me|pg||
pc|dK|nt|chick: and even if 4-2, opps cannot double (else you run to hearts)|pg||
nt|varange: then the DBL must have some unknown meaning|pg||
nt|varange: how would S interpret the 3@d|pg||
pc|d6|pc|h5|nt|arvid: even if south is showing some values with 3@D I think his hand is too good|pg||
nt|col3435: yeah, and club is worse!|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|chick: and to paraphrase your comment:   I hate playing in a 6-1 when 4-4 was available :)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: any opinions from kibs? majors or 1-suiter?|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|kaapo: Most do, but many don't :)|pg||

nt|kaapo: Nystöm could give a ruff but he would then lose his natural @C trick|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: yeah, but that would force south to ruff a club |pg||

nt|kaapo: At least that was how I played it|pg||
nt|kaapo: I guess he could try something|pg||
nt|kaapo: And 1@C could be 2 cards, either natural unbalanced, or balanced|pg||
nt|col3435: I'd rather West bid 3@d the first time|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|mmmakela: ok sound contract, 5 can be in jeopardy|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|kaapo: I see, tack Staffan|pg||
nt|kaapo: 2NT apparently shows a balanced hand, and now 4@C looks like a control bid with @H support|pg||

nt|mmmakela: 10 and next|pg||
nt|kaapo: It seems South is just relaying here|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sK|nt|kaapo: 5@H likely normal RKCB response, two key cards without the queen of hearts|pg||
nt|mcphee: yes, but I think they will play @H|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|mmmakela: needed a H lead and cashout|pg||
nt|chick: needed a heart back, now S can pitch the 2nd heart|pg||
nt|mmmakela: was too late|pg||
nt|kaapo: South had no fast entry to dummy?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: it was too late when east returned a club. East could return a diamond since South has no direct entry to dummy for a club finesse|pg||
pc|h4|nt|burypies: po kierowym tak|pg||
nt|kaapo: And North has likely described his full shape by now|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: North has shown 4315, 8-9p|pg||

mb|p|nt|kaapo: Many would open the South hand nowadays. Surprising to see a strong clubber pass it|pg||
nt|frankaus: not many would pass|pg||
nt|col3435: I thought it was because he didn't feel the hand was good enough with a misfit, but evidently it was more because he wanted the penalty|pg||
mb|1S|nt|kaapo: 1@C was either balanced or natural|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: 2@D looks like natural, nonforcing call|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|h2|pg||
nt|col3435: well, like that, evidently :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: after Pass by S i think she MUST bid it|pg||
nt|kaapo: By eptying the box save 7@S and 7NT|pg||
nt|col3435: if pass is forcing|pg||
nt|yuval10: the play will be interesting...... she might know that W has only 3 @s's from the bid|pg||
nt|yuval10: she can ruff 2 @d's..... and see that E has 3|pg||
nt|kaapo: Has West still something to think about?|pg||
nt|yuval10: then 8-1-3-1|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|chick: its not impossible that S will switch to spades, hoping to remove the entry to diamonds|pg||
nt|kaapo: North seems to have a chance for 10 tricks, if he raises the heart suit first|pg||
nt|yuval10: i belive she'll make it|pg||
nt|yuval10: sry HE will make it|pg||
nt|yuval10: because S is declarer|pg||
nt|kaapo: Cilla might make a comment about him never presenting a good dummy, and her showing an example :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: i think S will like the dummy he'll see :)  he knows it's a reasonable grand, now only have to make!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I think he will|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Would Haglund bid 6@S with @CQx?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|burypies: czasami nawet Witek ma piki|pg||
nt|kaapo: Apparently their 2NT opening was something like 22-24|pg||

mb|p|nt|kaapo: I don't object to that but I think it would be fair to state that 1NT is usually not 14 in 3rd hand then|pg||

nt|yuval10: NS can find a good sacrifice in a major|pg||

nt|yuval10: only -4|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mmmakela: hard to match the OR result here|pg||
nt|kaapo: 1@C 2-way|pg||

nt|kaapo: 2@S might show something like 8-12 here|pg||

pc|d3|nt|Walddk4: If he had a long minor instead of a major, it would be a psyche, but 1@H surely was not|pg||
