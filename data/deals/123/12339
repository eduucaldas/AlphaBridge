nt|Vugraphzgj: Director giving table into trouble for talking through the screen|pg||
nt|ady: west may open a weak 2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and a good solid one it is too|pg||
nt|ady: north has no definate action|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Another Roland|pg||
mb|p|nt|kdr_fm: 3@H N/s makes so 2@s is a good result in the open|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|athene: a pretty definite pass i think :)|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|1D|nt|mdgraham: NS play 2M as 8-11, with 2@D reserved for weaker (0-7!) hands|pg||
mb|1H!|nt|ady: likely to fail by 1 trick |pg||
nt|athene: double is just about vaguely possible from south|pg||
nt|rodal f: With the best spot NS|pg||
mb|d|nt|kdr_fm: Having said that 3@h vul is alot of bidding on the N/S cards|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 1@H shows @Ss|pg||
mb|2S!|mb|p|nt|mcarroll: 4@S is also a lot of bidding on the cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: the question here is whether declarer can build a diamond trick for a black-suit pitch|pg||
nt|ady: might  make on this lead  |pg||
nt|mcarroll: Dbl shows @Hs|pg||
mb|p|pc|hJ|nt|kdr_fm: right well .... this should be 5 imps or so to scotland|pg||
nt|athene: could put the @D8 in but playing low worked out ok anyway|pg||
nt|rodal f: And a good 2@S keept NS away|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hT|nt|rodal f: Normaly waisted @SK. Then 6@Hand 11HP at N in vul, but....|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|nt|hedyg: are you suggesting that N should pass?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|athene: i remember billy eisenberg's bridge tip was to play low in dummy even with nothing in hand - third hand won't know to take a deep finesse against dummy and it often lets you build ...|pg||
nt|athene: a trick from nothing|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|cliveo: a difficult hand for Holland to lead from|pg||

nt|golfsquash: good pass by north|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 2NT Lebensohl, compels 3@C and the 3NT shows @S stopper, adirect 3NT would deny a @S stop|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ady: should be 2 down on normal defence|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, maybe not :)|pg||

pc|hK|nt|athene: 3nt looks a bit much|pg||
nt|ady: 3 imps to England|pg||
nt|cliveo: According to their convention card Hamiltons 1NT presumably shows 12-14 so quite a stretch by Ferguson|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h3|nt|mcarroll: But Frank is right - a vanilla penalty double should gain|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|nt|ady: what did the 1NT rebid show?|pg||
pc|h8|nt|athene: he must have thought 1nt was strong, surely|pg||
nt|mdgraham: presumably putting a lot of value on the @HK |pg||
nt|cliveo: their convention card says 1NT opener is 15-17|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|rodal f: In OR NT came at Ns hand so here NS are taken by there 11-14     12-15NT|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|rodal f: Still must admit: @HK make there contract:)|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c8|nt|ady: then west was maximum for rebid  and still down 2|pg||
nt|rodal f: W lost a entery to early|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
pc|h9|nt|kdr_fm: 6 tricks will be good going - 3 imps out and thankfully not doubled|pg||
nt|golfsquash: falling apart now :)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: C!J continuation rather than @S would have helped the scramble|pg||

mb|1N|nt|andyv:  on 17, NIBU was able to pick up 5 imps when they played 2@d making 4 with the NS cards|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|jcwla: 1NT or 2@D definitely seemed the place to be there as N was punished for getting out of line.|pg||
mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|andyv:  2N here some type of super acceptance|pg||
mb|4H|nt|andyv:  so range must be 12-14 or so on their NT |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzgn: i think i overhead maximum|pg||
nt|andyv:  at least they right sided it for the moment|pg||
pc|h3|nt|jcwla: In that case if 18 is a 1NT open then there's something to be said for a 1NT open on 19.|pg||

mb|p|nt|ady: easy game for n/s   |pg||
nt|athene: not a great 6@S here but it does make|pg||
nt|rodal f: Running resaults: http://www.camrosebridge.com/action.php Something wrong at the match Irland - England|pg||
mb|1N|nt|mdgraham: marginal 6@S, nothing special |pg||
mb|2C!|nt|golfsquash: a chance here to recoup some Imps|pg||
nt|athene: if they don't lead @HA or a club you probably end up having to find the @HJ|pg||
nt|mdgraham: @HJ coming down in three rounds is handy|pg||
nt|athene: although there are various ways you can fiddle around|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and there is also a two-way finesse for it |pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|athene: maybe you ruff some hearts and/or clubs and then run trumps and hope for a squeeze if no big cards fell|pg||
nt|ady: unlikely to get beyond game|pg||
nt|athene: i seriously doubt they will play anywhere other than 4@S|pg||
mb|3C!|mb|p|nt|kdr_fm: yup scrambled lots a tricks there ... just dont agree with 2@C in teams .. maybe not vul its ok but 400 out ...|pg||
nt|athene: hmmm...2@C might get south interested|pg||
nt|cliveo: If they bid it I would expect them to make it|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: the problem with doubling on hands like south's is when it goes double all pass and the penalty is insufficient|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|nt|kdr_fm: this works @Hk onside 620 in|pg||
nt|cliveo: What would you bid then?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: if you don't want to just bid 4@S on these hands, then play something funky like 4@C overcall is a "strong" 4major bid|pg||
nt|mdgraham: there is also the possibility that there may not be any penalty at all  |pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c8|nt|ady: diamond lead and continuation means heart finesse of the 10 is necessary to make 12 tricks|pg||

nt|golfsquash: The bidding is also a clue|pg||
pc|d3|nt|athene: if you lead the @HK and west wins and switches there will be a double squeeze around hearts|pg||
nt|mcarroll: when the NT opener makes a free bid after a nonforcing bid from partner anything can happen - and here it has|pg||

nt|cliveo: I wonder what the difference was between 2 @S and 4 @S by Brunner|pg||
mb|1H|nt|athene: 4@S logically has to be very long spades and hence a really big hand not to have just bid them first time|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|ady: you mean after the 2@C from Holland?|pg||

pc|s5|nt|ady: would have to take right view in trumps and ruff finesse the hearts to make 12 tricks   |pg||
