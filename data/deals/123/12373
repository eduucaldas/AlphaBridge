mb|p|nt|eamongall: Ew playing modified Blue @C |pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|eamongall: and Denning Shields in the NS playing a strong @C system |pg||

mb|p|nt|eamongall: a steady start for the OBriain brothers who must be getting close to 90 years bridge experience between them |pg||
mb|1C!|nt|davidstern: Pretty good 5@C contract depending on diamond finesse|pg||
nt|davidstern: And of course E/W make 4M|pg||
nt|barbyh: 2 cl has shut them out of the auction|pg||
nt|chick: anyone for overcalling with E hand?|pg||
nt|davidstern: I'm not sure I would have passed East at Nil Vul|pg||
nt|davidstern: Oh yes|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ppiglett: Unless he hoped declaler would get the club return wrong - ie rise with Q|pg||
mb|3N|nt|wilkinsona: Scotland in the OR made 1NT here|pg||
mb|p|nt|ppiglett: Nice lie in hearts for 3N|pg||
nt|ppiglett: East holding J|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Hard to defend 3NT S. Only a @C lead makes it down|pg||
mb|p|pc|h2|nt|davidstern: So good sacrifice as we have to assume that E or W may have come in if N/S rested much lower|pg||
nt|chick: or may have pushed them to 5M|pg||
nt|davidstern: I suspect that they would always have arrived in 5@C with or wothout E/W bidding|pg||
nt|phil_20686:  i assume this is a precision one diamond, there is quite a wide variance of style over what the north hand should bid after precision 1d-x-|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 13 tricks|pg||
pc|hA|nt|phil_20686:  you have any preferences for norths bidding here tony?|pg||
nt|golfsquash: 14|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mdgraham: the fact that the diamond finesse is offside for NS means that it is onside for EW|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|nt|ppiglett: On the K of diamond lead note that it is important that N throws the Jack to expose the position afetr E ducks|pg||

mb|p|nt|andyv:  true, with a @h lead being more likely|pg||
nt|eamongall: hows about 12 tricks somewhere for NS here |pg||
mb|1D|nt|eamongall: 30 hcp and a 9 card set of trumps |pg||
nt|andyv:  have to make sure N plays it|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|andyv:  looks like 6@h or 6N by N|pg||
nt|eamongall: any side as far as I see ...but I am not always the best at seeing things|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|andyv:  i meant 6@h by N or 6N by S|pg||
nt|andyv:  but it will be hard to reach (6@d by either side is cold)|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|eamongall: Andy I am missing something but thats ok |pg||
nt|andyv:  N made a nice 4N bid... hard to invite when you hold xxx in opps suit|pg||
nt|eamongall: blind spot is normally about 12 inches in front of my face |pg||
nt|andyv:  since 3N by S could be based on QJx|pg||
nt|andyv:  and I don't think you are missing anything:)|pg||
nt|eamongall: ok so 12 tricks in red suit or NT for NS whoever wants to play ... NEXT ..|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes|pg||
nt|eamongall: as well known commentator Joey Silver says |pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|nt|eamongall: but then there is always the singing lady who bids 7 ...or one for the road|pg||

nt|mdgraham: I think you need a certain amount of guessage|pg||
nt|barbyh: if they guess the ht|pg||
nt|eamongall: I heard a rumour that the Norwegian soccer captain won some event in US Nationals for bridge |pg||
nt|jackthelad: aha he did :)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: a useful 3 imps|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|nt|davidstern: Heart partial for N/S or low @S partial for E/W|pg||
nt|mdgraham: a very restrained pass of 2@H by East next door|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ppiglett: Unfortunately when you make a slightly against the odds decision, the hand sits perfect for game - unlucky for e-w|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mdgraham: and here too|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|mb|2S!|mb|p|nt|rodal f: A very good lead|pg||
nt|phil_20686:  this south hand is a normal precision 1h opener, and 2d looks to be a non forcing freebid|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: surprise alert of 2 diamonds..?|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|golfsquash: n/s play a lot of transfers over overcalls|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|davidstern: I believe that this will be one level too high|pg||
nt|phil_20686:  It would be interesting to know norths agreements about the 3c bid|pg||
nt|phil_20686:  as opposed to 2n|pg||
nt|jackthelad: N just likes to bid|pg||
nt|ppiglett: I bid spades partner!|pg||
mb|3N|nt|davidstern: East better make sure he doesnt get endplayed - unlikely of course|pg||
nt|davidstern: E/W probably feel a little sick at this point - could have passed out 4@H and now being forced to defend 4|pg||
nt|chick: do you think E is leading this K because he thinks his pard has the suit?   surely he can't want a ruff with that trump holding|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, it happens. I once protected against 1@D in the pass-out seat and ended up conceding 1370 in 6@C|pg||
nt|chick: so annoying |pg||
nt|barbyh: now thats bad luck|pg||
nt|davidstern: If he believes the @HA is with South he can split honours, win next heart get partner in and get his ruff so not THAT unusual|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Ace and switch to the Jack of hearts - only chance|pg||
nt|ppiglett: 2C showing D, 2S FTG and asking. Now N looking at eleven red winners so should push on |pg||
nt|golfsquash: this would be a great slam to bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: wan't too bad - oppo conceded 1540|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: its seems to be the right contract|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ppiglett: well done|pg||
mb|p|nt|barbyh: best play|pg||
mb|5D|nt|rodal f: -1 now|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidstern: Low spade now|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ppiglett: Bid it with a club A please?|pg||
pc|s6|nt|jackthelad: again spot on|pg||
nt|golfsquash: what would 4NT by north be?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|davidstern: And there will be an endplay if that happened|pg||
pc|sA|nt|phil_20686:  yeah, but there are 3 hand types here that affect the preferences, 6-4, 5-5 5-4, i suspect that most experts would use the 2nt bid to show whatever of these they deem most important, as a natural meaning seems superflous|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Surely N was worried that two clubs could be off and tried to show tricks in H and pin point the club position|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|nt|davidstern: Also with 7 spades thought it possible partner may have a singleton spade|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes|pg||
nt|barbyh: can actually make now|pg||
mc|12|nt|rodal f: If E had time to take away @H he could drop one round @S and 8 on|pg||

nt|davidstern: Playing East for @CK-x would lead top the same result|pg||
nt|golfsquash: 4@h may have been just a cuebid, so maybe he needs to do a bit more|pg||
mb|p|nt|ppiglett: Yes maybe I agree |pg||
mb|1C!|nt|wilkinsona: game from Short and Walker closed room..|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S!|mb|p|nt|phil_20686:  that seems like a big result|pg||
mb|1N|nt|davidstern: Did anybody look at the OR Bidding - 1NT by west pass pass and X by south - presumably majors|pg||
nt|eamongall: well NS have a 15 count ...so EW must be near game ...but it better not be 3NT ..as 5 @Cs off that |pg||
nt|ppiglett: right sided. A spade lead from West could have caused trouble|pg||
mb|p|nt|ppiglett: 3N = a flat 13-15 and three hearts I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|barbyh: no because he gets his other ht|pg||
nt|davidstern: If East has @CK-x can avoid endplay by unblocking the @CK|pg||
nt|ppiglett: show  majors?|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Lost there best partscore @H|pg||
nt|mcarroll: true - but in Open W led the 4th highest @C|pg||
pc|h2|nt|wilkinsona: once again John Murdoch competes in spades, slightly different holding this time|pg||
pc|h7|nt|davidstern: NBice card that @D10|pg||
nt|davidstern: Nice|pg||
nt|davidstern: For declarer anyway|pg||
nt|mdgraham: what do we think of the 1@S overcall?|pg||

nt|barbyh: not for my taste|pg||

nt|eamongall: Murchan fancies himself as a dummy player |pg||
nt|eamongall: so lets see his effort |pg||
nt|phil_20686:  the problem for the defence is that they cannot lead their partners suit enough times so declarer will never have a problem scoring (eventually) 3c 4h 1s 1d|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d9|pg||
nt|davidstern: I claim|pg||
nt|mdgraham: very sensible too.|pg||
nt|ciaran: Even AK is possible, so looks right to start trumps from dummy|pg||

nt|davidstern: Spec says: Surprising a partnership of 30 years plus standing has this misunderstanding|pg||
nt|eamongall: I wonder would I be able to avoid the @SK ...|pg||

pc|h3|pc|h5|nt|eamongall: I typed this before murchan played it |pg||
nt|phil_20686:  5-2 diamonds would give declarer a real problem as he would have to knock out easts exit card before west played a second diamond|pg||
nt|eamongall: people are telling me double dummy plays but please remember Murchan is an ordinary human and does not even see 4 hands let alone have a gib button |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: defence to keep declarer from his hand now|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|pg||

nt|viren169: It could be a story of 2 halves!|pg||

mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: After that well played hand by John Murdoch we have a close match..|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: west wanted to ruff that|pg||
nt|phil_20686:  no greenwood chose to make the two sclubs overcall over 1s, which is much better than a 3c bid which is nether expecially preemptive or especialy costructive|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|nt|chick: Hi Tez :)|pg||

nt|phil_20686:  so how will the panel vote to bid over the artifical 1c opener? tony?|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|davidstern: Anyone for playing a low spade at trick two before South can signal too much|pg||
nt|chick: it doesn't look very hopeful, I'm sure she is trying to work out a lie of the cards that would let her make this|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|eamongall: depends on the panel and how many phil stephens is on it |pg||
pc|h3|nt|chick: :)|pg||
nt|eamongall: still 4@H minus is better then 3@S or more making |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: perhaps this should have been more down...|pg||
