nt|athene: 4@S wouldn't have been fun for NS - west was just waiting to get his hands on that one|pg||

nt|mcarroll: Hi Ciaran|pg||
mb|1N|nt|james_h: Lets see if NS help/push EW to slam?|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|james_h: Tom Hanlon takes matters into his own hands|pg||
nt|james_h: Given this start,I think south will definately sac in 6@s ... lets see|pg||
nt|mcarroll: How many @S from Hugh? 4 I guess|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and now we will compare the scores|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: that last board may well produce a swing - as even 3@s on spot on defenc cant make|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|mdgraham: Hamman in his book castigated the jack-denies lead method. |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ..and hi William|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: 3@D = transfer|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ciaran: Hi Martin|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: Reckoned it gave declarer more help than it was worth |pg||
nt|chick: how high will NS go in @Ds?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: As ever with these thngs, the truth is somewhere near the middle|pg||
nt|chick: looks like 4 is the limit|pg||
nt|frankaus: this action quite a contrast to th OR|pg||
nt|vugraphzgh: PC technical problem with the CR NIBU NI match|pg||
nt|mdgraham: an enterprising 1@S overcall |pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|mcarroll: And James is right if EW bid 6 they will find the save|pg||
nt|andyv:  this one will take some work|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: normal enough to reach 4major when you have a 5-4 fit and some shape|pg||
nt|andyv:  and some help which the @c lead does provide|pg||
nt|athene: but south's values aren't exactly where north wants them|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: 3NT here would be my choice aswell|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: duck a diamond|pg||
nt|james_h: whos buying?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  defence can well start with taking first 5 tricks|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ciaran: Looks like an easy 4S or a thin 6S here which will fail due to both trump honours being offside|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s3|nt|frankaus: 10 quickly|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|mcarroll: OK - me|pg||
nt|james_h: Martin is a great team player|pg||
nt|athene: east had better jump in with the @DA and switch to a spad|pg||
nt|athene: spade|pg||
nt|andyv:  difficult hand to declare... when N goes after @ds, the @s switch will be obvious|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: good double - wrong ace for a maximum penalty godd still going down|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  not yet though|pg||
pc|s7|nt|andyv:  but E seems to be unaware of the danger to the hand|pg||
nt|athene: well it's very hard for east - he doesn't know anything about declarer's hand|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: needed to win diamond ace first time really..|pg||
nt|andyv:  but he does know he has no tricks in @ds and @cs... @s suit is only hope|pg||

nt|mdgraham: with the added advantage that the defence may not take the queen|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi Frank|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d7|nt|ciaran: when the wind is in your sails, these contracts make - a little unlucky for Hamilton and Ferguson|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mcarroll: A bit unfortunate - the bidding looks reasonable, unlucky to find the trumps stacked. So first imps to CBAIlookk|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|frankaus: 11 now & may take @H fin for 12|pg||
nt|chick: wish I knew what 3@H meant .. might be a clue to whether to finesse @Hs or not|pg||
nt|mdgraham: high card raise to 3@S, I suspect|pg||
pc|d6|nt|james_h: North needs to establish @d because he cant draw t and ruff, 3@c and 1@h|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|h6|nt|wilkinsona: best of fortune re exams..|pg||
nt|athene: even if you know that declarer has a singleton diamond, it might sometimes be right to duck - give declarer @SAxx for instance|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.camrosebridge.com/  for a website with lots of useful information|pg||
nt|athene: now rising the ace gives him pitches for both spades but if you duck he loses no diamond but two spades|pg||
nt|athene: but i agree it might have ben findable if east remembers his side needs FOUR tricks to beat this|pg||
nt|andyv:  as long as this isn't match points, rising with A of @d and switching to K of @s was called for. |pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|frankaus: Value raise of @S would be my guess|pg||

nt|andyv:  now this one really does require a lot of work|pg||
mb|d|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  in modern bidding, strong dbl on 1N is out of date |pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: :)|pg||
nt|athene: you can be a lot more aggressive with hands like east's if you know it's a 4-4 fit|pg||
nt|andyv:  3 chances to make... slim, fat and none|pg||
nt|athene: maybe he expected 2@H to guarantee a 4th trump|pg||
mb|p|pc|h5|pc|h3|pc|hQ|nt|andyv:  some use 2N (this time it would be by E) to find out what quality of raise partner gave them... it would have helped this time|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yes E has assumed 4 hearts, and I think at least 3 diamonds and added a bit more as well|pg||
nt|athene: north has quite a lot of defensive cards not to double this|pg||
nt|athene: but his partner is a passed hand and he doesn't have any distributional surprises|pg||
nt|andyv:  but, E was a bit optomistic....2@h was already too high|pg||
nt|athene: and no-one forced east to bid game!|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: 8 tricks only and no real pressure on E/W - i cant see a 9th ?|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|ciaran: the defense can get a cross ruff going here for -3|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes in first position, but a balancing dbl over 2@H is very much in vogue|pg||

pc|dT|pc|dK|nt|marlowepi: N obviously unsure whether 4N was for the minors or a serious offer to play 4N. but if S is running from 4S, he more or less has to have the minors regardless. Thus N could bid 5C. ...|pg||

nt|james_h: things|pg||
nt|po-s: I doubt that|pg||
nt|mcarroll: A bit surprising S did not show both Majors?|pg||
nt|james_h: lets see|pg||
mb|2H|nt|rodal f: P??|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Is 2@C really a limited opening? I mean, after all she has a 3 loser hand. Impossible to catch up later I predict. I agree with PO|pg||
nt|james_h: Ciara(West) in crying|pg||
nt|po-s: now South|pg||
nt|james_h: I'm sure|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: 21 points and the opps have ignored you ... and found a fit ... |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  good sign for finding fit with partner - N must be short in @h|pg||
mb|2N|nt|mcarroll: Good Pass|pg||
nt|andyv:  10 tricks will fall on S's lap|pg||
nt|andyv:  anyone here like not leading pd's suit?|pg||
nt|athene: it's sensible to not lead partner's suit if you have one of your own|pg||
nt|athene: but eschewing the spade lead with a doubleton, just for KQx, seems a bit weird|pg||
nt|andyv:  i agree|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: @H and this may suceed|pg||
nt|james_h: South must smell a rat as he likes to balance|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  game in @c looks attractive|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: only fit left is @C's  - I like A 2NT gets the values across and N is marked with a few @s's on the auction|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|chick: E has an interesting problem here .... N didn't choose NT without a good stopper in @Hs|pg||
nt|chick: so is one of his black suits better chance to set?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that's a lead declarer didn't want to see  |pg||
nt|james_h: this is an EW implosion|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes they dont have the theoretical points required, but maybe they will take the view that 3NT may be as likely as 2?|pg||
nt|ciaran: Will probably stop in 2N and be thankful to make|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: may concern declarer though..|pg||
nt|andyv:  rule of 6 should have told declarer not to hold up|pg||
mb|3N|nt|wilkinsona: yep, spade now gives south some losing options...|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: not sure of the EW system here....2@D either a straightforward Multi (so to speak) or possibly a bad-suit weak two|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|andyv:  idee fixe|pg||
nt|mcarroll: S plays 4NT in Open|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mdgraham: told 2@D=5-7, 5+cards|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  red lead brings 8th trick, what about 9th?|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: not sure about the 3@h bid seems a bit much - then again 3@s looks like a make and opposite @sHx even with the known 4+ @s with east woukd have good chances|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mdgraham: sorry, 0-7 hcp|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|athene: when you try a speculative lead and declarer ducks, you always hope you found a good thing|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mcarroll: S really doesn't want to lead any suit|pg||
nt|ciaran: What was Hamilton's 2D?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgh: Some alerts have not been entered in this auction|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c3|pc|c4|pg||
pc|cK|nt|po-s: Probably there was a West face when Pass came back|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Well, the crux of the matter is that the West hand is too good for 2@C|pg||
nt|james_h: lol PO|pg||
nt|andyv:  I wonder why W is so reluctant to lead pd's suit|pg||
pc|d3|pc|c5|pc|c8|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well, E seemed to encourage, and if so maybe wrong..|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: If the @C's broke 2/2 and hugh was able to sneak the @c9 into dummy this would make as it is hes blocked|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mcarroll: 2@C is 5 card Stayman so 2@D denies|pg||
pc|h2|pc|c6|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|athene: in which case there's far less long-term future in spades|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: possible end play here - W is probably going to discard 3@h and now @ha and another should produce 2@d tricks|pg||
pc|c2|nt|kdr_fm: using the entry to finesse @D and play for split @d honours it looks like|pg||
pc|s6|nt|athene: west is sure the missing spades are 5-4, rather than 6-3|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  2 more rounds of @c would have been better |pg||
pc|c7|pc|d4|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  next door S managed to take 9 tricks|pg||

mb|1C!|mb|d!|nt|sfoxa:  I was told, after @d Q lead|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|ciaran: Another hand where a spade slam may be investigated, but they need to stop at 4S|pg||
mb|1H|nt|andyv:  seems like a reasonable slam... not sure why it would go down|pg||
nt|athene: how do you fail in 6@H?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: viewgraph probably represented the true state of affairs there...|pg||
nt|andyv:  trumps are 2-2 and only need to ruff 2@cs in dummy|pg||
mb|2D|nt|mdgraham: what happened there?|pg||
nt|ciaran: Difficult decision for S now|pg||
mb|3C|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|andyv:  I imagine E tried to ruff a @d low|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: yes declarer set off ruffing clubs but very carelessly ruffed a diamond with the @H2|pg||
nt|athene: there was a hand in a set earlier this morning where declarer had something like @S63 in dummy and ruffing with the @S6 stopped an overruff|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: 4 hearts was a sign off but west moves on..|pg||
nt|athene: west is always bidding slam with that hand after 1@H|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: @S suit not getting mentioned here so far|pg||
mb|3S|nt|mcarroll: Got it right|pg||
nt|ciaran: Well done|pg||
mb|p|nt|ciaran: Good choice - when N could not cue 4D, he needs a lot to make slam|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: ahhh|pg||
mb|4S|nt|athene: just a question of six or seven|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: well, asks about the grand|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|hK|pc|hA|nt|athene: perhaps there was a misunderstanding about the nature of 6@H here|pg||
nt|athene: east thought 5NT was asking for specific kings so 6@H denied one|pg||
nt|athene: and west thought 6@H showed two side kings|pg||
nt|andyv:  interesting push board|pg||
nt|athene: if that isn't the case, west was just illogical - why not bid 7@H over 5?|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: thats quite a raise by east on a 5 count but the clues are there - pd at least 6/4 opps bidding @D pd short .. good bid|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: 6 clubs a good bid, whatever I think|pg||
nt|athene: and the count wasn't rectified for a spade-diamond squeeze on east|pg||
nt|ciaran: Certainly, but any minor honour would be far more valueable - @D K instead of @S K and slam is good|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mdgraham: lots of shape here - this auction could end with the word double |pg||
mb|p|nt|eamongall: Whats this Twitter thing ...says I can get tweets from the Camrose2010 ...or something |pg||
mb|2D|nt|frankaus: interesting collection poll 4 contract ? 5@C 4 me|pg||
nt|mdgraham: reckon so|pg||
nt|chick: first NS have to get in the action|pg||
nt|andyv:  and 12 imps to N. Ireland which has edged out to an 18 imp lead|pg||
nt|ciaran: Lucky set for CBAI - the NIBU slam on board 1 had much better odds, but went off.  |pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|james_h: Hanlon played with Carroll yesterday, can anyone explain why?|pg||

mb|3S|nt|chick: commentators curse strikes again, no double and no 5@C :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|kdr_fm: 6@S double dumy seems to be there - but 4@s the likely spot|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  yes, EW are playing precision|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yes 1 c strong and I think 1 spade 3-6 with 5 cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|james_h: thanks for responces ... McGann was snow delayed it seems|pg||

nt|mcarroll: In Open John Carroll opened  the W hand 2@D - Multi, !!, 4@H - pass or correct  from Garvey, Double by S - (not greeted with approval by the commentators)|pg||
nt|eamongall: Blue Club stuff for Murchan Burns ..well it used to be when they played a few years ago |pg||

nt|ciaran: N/S were clearly on different wavelengths about the second double|pg||

nt|kdr_fm: sry what happened there ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgh: contract made|pg||
nt|vugraphzgh: EW having short discussion|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: how ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: thanks, Christine|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|athene: interesting auction in the other room|pg||
nt|athene: my guess is, east thought that 2@D was majors|pg||
nt|petepunt: 1@C 16+ or bal 11-15|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  2 @s + 2 @d + 1 @h + 1 @c - where is the 7th? |pg||
mb|3C!|mb|p|nt|athene: some pairs play 1minor (1nt) 2minor = both majors|pg||
nt|ciaran: Could be more IMPS for NIBU here - E's 10 count was worth a game bid opposite a 14-16 NT, but they may stay lower here due to playing a different range|pg||
nt|petepunt: looks good for 20-22|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mcarroll: There was none - but it is scored as making|pg||
mb|p|nt|kdr_fm: schance here 6@c is on|pg||
nt|vugraphzgh: It did make defensive error|pg||
mb|p|nt|eamongall: I must say ...the camrose2010 website even tells you where to buy fish and chips ...as well as all the useful bridge information |pg||
nt|eamongall: Designed by Mr Officer ..hurray for him |pg||
nt|mcarroll: In Open E backed in with 3@C after much the same auction and plays there|pg||
mb|p|pc|d7|nt|athene: wow, that's an unusual lead choice|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yep|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|nt|petepunt: 6@C tough to bid|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: returned a heart didnt cash @CJ ?|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|athene: K10xx rather than KQxx|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c8|pc|c2|nt|ciaran: should make 9 tricke for 5 IMPs to NIBU|pg||

pc|cK|pc|h2|pc|c3|pc|h6|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|sfoxa:  seems so|pg||
pc|h4|pc|c6|pc|h8|pg||
nt|athene: i should have thought the @DK lead is far less likely to give away a trick|pg||
nt|athene: you know the @DA is almost certainly over you|pg||
nt|athene: but club lead could have found declarer with the queen|pg||
nt|andyv:  the lack of spot cards in the @d suit makes it almost even odds with a @c lead|pg||
nt|athene: or even something like Jxx with declarer, AQx in dummy|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: the pips in diamonds are poor so I go with Easts lead|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ciaran: Good try from Micheal - hoping partner has @HKx |pg||
pc|s4|nt|james_h: and struck gold|pg||
nt|mcarroll: yep|pg||
nt|james_h: another example of fortune favouring the bold|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|mb|d|nt|mdgraham: 2@S=good raise in clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzgh: x = raise to 2S|pg||

nt|chick: makes the second bid much easier in competition|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|mdgraham: sure, if partner expects a canape |pg||
nt|ciaran: A much longer auction in the other room to reach the same contract|pg||

mb|3H|nt|james_h: There is too much sex going on up north these days, they should focus their minds on bridge|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: but it could confuse the suit lengths|pg||
nt|chick: doesn't usually matter with 6-5 ... pard will have one of the two suits|pg||

mb|p|pc|sT|nt|kdr_fm: 3@c was ?|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  after that W has 3 useful points, not 7|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: very surprised they not in 4 then every card in the west hand is full value - surely worth a 3@d game try ..|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s7|pg||
nt|chick: what you say is right, Mike, but in cases like this, all you really want to do is make pard pick one of your two suits|pg||
nt|eamongall: Its not that James surely ... its lack of game time against players of EBU and Team Silver level |pg||
pc|h5|pc|h4|nt|petepunt: but @h likely 4-1 after x|pg||
pc|hA|nt|james_h: I blame the non sectarian sex|pg||

nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|mdgraham: as you would far rather be in a 6-2 fit than a 5-2 fit|pg||
nt|chick: If the 5-2 suit is trump and badly split, maybe yes, but I think most of the time, you will lose the same tricks in either contract.  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: rather thought South would get the diamonds right there |pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, you might get forced as well - as is being graphically demonstrated here |pg||

mb|p|nt|chick: I'm surprised that W hasn't shown the spades yet|pg||

pc|c2|pc|c3|pc|c7|pg||
nt|eamongall: 2/1 Hardy I think |pg||
nt|golfsquash: a trump promotion to beat this!|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|d9|pc|c5|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c8|nt|marlowepi: will take an underlead|pg||
pc|s4|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|eamongall: possible on bidding |pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes but S might easily have raised on doubleton, even xx|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|nt|golfsquash: would look silly if south had a higher spade honour|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h5|pg||
pc|h6|pc|s2|pc|h3|pc|h9|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that is unlikely though--what is E bidding on?|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|pc|s6|pc|s3|pg||
nt|golfsquash: south might have tried a higher club at trick 3|pg||
nt|eamongall: well looks like +5 imps becomes -1 |pg||
pc|sK|pc|sJ|pc|s7|pc|sQ|pg||
mc|9|nt|Vugraphzgm: thnx all|pg||
nt|marlowepi: a very flat match except for the 5-trick swing in 3N due to which hand was on lead|pg||
nt|golfsquash: thx all, see you soon|pg||
nt|eamongall: think its 5:35 restart |pg||
nt|eamongall: but they often do a presentation of Teams at this stage |pg||
nt|Vugraphzgm: yes|pg||

nt|mdgraham: Hi Frank|pg||
nt|mcarroll: EW have a good red suit save but almost impossible to find at the 5 level|pg||
nt|andyv:  good morning Bill|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome Martin and Sveta|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: hearts vs. spades here|pg||

nt|mcarroll: Hi Sveta|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  hello to all, hi Roland and Martin|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|vugraphzgh: Welcome to the Camrose in Edinburgh|pg||
nt|vugraphzgh: Discussing system Burns McGann|pg||
nt|athene: hard to say how high it will go..maybe just a gentle 3 of something|pg||
nt|athene: 2@H is presumably non-forcing ("negative free bid")|pg||
nt|athene: if it's forcing he is short of a few big cards :)|pg||
nt|Walddk5: also welcome to Karel De Raeymaeker|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: hi all|pg||

nt|james_h: Hi All|pg||
nt|james_h: hi Martin|pg||
nt|andyv:  off into the wild blue yonder|pg||
nt|vugraphzgh: Forcing 1 round|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty, Christine|pg||
nt|athene: 5@D must be west's|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: nice opening board for N/S as 2NT is hairy|pg||
nt|vugraphzgh: Welcome to everyone and thanks|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|pc|s7|nt|vugraphzgh: That is how it was explained to South|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@C inverted?|pg||
nt|frankaus: nicely rightsided|pg||
nt|vugraphzgh: Hi |pg||
nt|james_h: This is a battle between a 2 wal club NS and a 1 way club EW|pg||
nt|james_h: way|pg||
nt|andyv:  if EW are playing precision, dbl of 2S should have shown max for the bidding but hardly inviting E to keep bidding|pg||
nt|mcarroll: a good Pass fro W|pg||
pc|sK|nt|andyv:  agree|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mcarroll: from|pg||
pc|s6|nt|james_h: Nice work by NS here, 2NT a good raise, 3d a trial bid (I expect)|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, if East leads back a heart....question is, could the lead be from KJ10|pg||
nt|frankaus: will they find the killing defence?|pg||
pc|d6|nt|athene: not sure why south didn't jump on 5@C|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dQ|nt|mdgraham: take the money and run.....|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|chick: I count 5 clubs, 4 diamonds, and a spade.  next :)|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|d4|pc|d7|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d9|pc|d8|pc|dT|pg||
nt|james_h: the @hk really punished McGann|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c3|pc|c5|nt|athene: east would have been better-off to bid a weak jump shift 3@H over 1@S|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
mc|8|nt|sfoxa:  as usually, in CR we started with 2 last boards|pg||
