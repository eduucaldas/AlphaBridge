nt|imp_jan: joke :)|pg||
nt|daman: relax|pg||
nt|imp_jan: correct now|pg||
nt|Vugraph814: Muller didn't open 2@S, he's declaring the contract however, but I didn't get the auction|pg||
nt|daman: probably a transfer response by W|pg||
nt|imp_jan: probably east had opened 1n (12-15) and after xfer they play 2@S|pg||
nt|daman: oh    so EW play weak NT     |pg||
pc|c3|pc|c4|pc|cK|pg||
nt|imp_jan: ew play Tarzan Precision with a weak nt|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c7|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|daman: thanks Jan    and NS?  Polish|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hQ|pc|hK|pc|h2|pg||
nt|imp_jan: NS play Polish Club|pg||
nt|daman: thx|pg||
pc|h9|nt|daman: do either play raptor/|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hJ|pc|hT|pc|h6|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pc|d3|pc|d2|pg||
nt|imp_jan: EW dont play Raptor I believe, NS I dont know, but not likely|pg||
nt|daman: ok|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|s4|pg||
pc|d8|nt|imp_jan: 2@S shld be an easy make|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dK|pc|d7|pg||
nt|daman: definitely|pg||
nt|imp_jan: not a hand WH is waiting for|pg||
nt|Vugraph814: TD has been called|pg||
nt|daman: no   they need distributional hands requiring good judgement|pg||
nt|Vugraph814: Muller said "Spade, Diamond"|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dJ|pc|s9|pc|d9|pg||
mc|8|nt|Vugraph814: TD ruled @D could be played|pg||
pg||
qx|c4|st||md|2SKJT42HT2DAQT8CT2,SHQ8743DK75CAQJ73,SQ985HAK9DJ92C964,SA763HJ65D643CK85|sv|b|nt|burry1975: the 17 imps difference that we see is the carry over from the Round Robin stage|pg||
nt|burry1975: war and peace:-)|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok|pg||
nt|sybarra: that makes more sense  |pg||
nt|jeanhari: easy 4@S, NS missing diamond control|pg||
nt|sybarra: and not only game on the @D  ruff|pg||
nt|xenya: so just 1 off undoubled -- could be a swing |pg||
nt|xenya: what a freak|pg||
mb|2H|nt|burry1975: in which the White House eliminated all|pg||
nt|sybarra: I suspect the TD has spoken about "lets pick up the pace boys" |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|xenya: hard to predict where all that will end|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  If 4@c is a two suiter, North can probably just bid 5@h now|pg||
mb|d!|nt|xenya: nice|pg||
mb|p|nt|burry1975: 4 hearts look playable here|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - friendly @C break helps|pg||
nt|xenya: i tend to agree|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Maybe South will bid again though|pg||
mb|3S|nt|nigel_k:  The other table is playing board 1 now so we should start to see comparisons|pg||
nt|burry1975: interesting detail is that de wijs muller played the round robin in a different team (onstein 2)|pg||
mb|p|nt|burry1975: but they were promoted to the first squad after that |pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: "I have a very "suited" hand for you p", Jansma said|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: "Void again, huh", Paulissen said|pg||
nt|jeanhari: S will make a move now|pg||
nt|xenya: N might leave the double in?|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: no -- well done|pg||
mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  I think North has quite good cards for offence opposite a red two suiter and no certain defence|pg||
nt|xenya: hopefully we'll have no more breakdowns|pg||
nt|rnmalik: hope so:)|pg||
nt|xenya: good stop|pg||
nt|vugraphzbt: should be fine now :)|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c2|nt|sybarra: and a likely @D  lead will pick up that suit and so it is |pg||
nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
pc|cA|nt|rnmalik: 2@H DBL was also profitable for NS|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|xenya: but the game is just on a finesse|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hA|pc|h6|pc|h2|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s3|nt|jeanhari: not easy to look for a way te defeat a cold game|pg||
pc|s2|pc|h3|pg||
pc|s5|nt|burry1975: suddenly he's the whirlwind:-)|pg||
nt|sharkey: hope Bas can keep up :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: Barely|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: The slower they play the harder, you have to be focused without having anything to do|pg||
nt|xenya: 4-0 trump split is a nuisance but can be overcome|pg||
pc|s6|nt|xenya: 6@C would have been a correct save here|pg||
pc|sT|nt|sharkey: think you jinxed him Frank |pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|s4|nt|burry1975: 5s X on board 2 is duplicated in the open room|pg||
pc|d7|pc|s8|pc|sA|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hT|pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|burry1975: paulissen shouldnt try to finesse in spades now else an extra undertrick|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sJ|pc|h8|pg||
nt|rnmalik: the defense get the k@D|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d3|pc|d8|pc|dK|pg||

nt|Vugraphzbt: Btw kibs, I know they're slow, but I don't have a stun baton...|pg||
nt|sybarra: stun baton=cattle prod |pg||
nt|sybarra: and the word is "next"|pg||
mb|2D|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|xenya: Witte Huis is 50 imps behind with 24 boards to go|pg||
mb|3D!|mb|d|mb|p|nt|sybarra: nicer name for it Bas|pg||
nt|burry1975: 5c and 5h for ew?|pg||
nt|sybarra: you have|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 6@D for EW if they can bid it|pg||
nt|sybarra: a slem in @D |pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: presumingly, double shows a one-suiter|pg||
mb|r|nt|sybarra: and right , can they bid it?|pg||
nt|jeanhari: think it will end here|pg||
nt|xenya: S has nothing to say?|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|burry1975: 1 spade is limited so 4s can be anything, very tough for ew to get into the bidding|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: Jansma tanking now|pg||
nt|sybarra: Jan Jansma always has smile  |pg||
nt|burry1975: with this vulnerability i think double by west is aggressive (i would pass too) but defendable|pg||
nt|sybarra: even when tanking |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jeanhari: not easy for EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: declarer needs to get @Hs right to make it seems|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  This is trick as there are so few entries and the heart ruff is a threat|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I think he needs to play clubs twice or a misdefence|pg||
pc|dK|nt|xenya: difficult contract|pg||
pc|d3|nt|xenya: interesting problems both for declarer and defence here|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like 1 down|pg||
pc|d4|nt|nigel_k:  Actually a heart to the 10 is ok as he can draw trumps before they are able to get the ruff|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|xenya: at least|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c7|nt|nigel_k:  2@h should not pose any problem - probably nine tricks|pg||
pc|c2|nt|xenya: now it's easier -- but suppose S ducks?|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I dont know I might have passed with E hand|pg||
nt|xenya: a club, a spade and three trumps to lose|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dQ|nt|burry1975: on board three where drijver converted 3nt to 4sp his white house equivalent didn't, so the gap is narrowed to three imps|pg||
nt|burry1975: brink must feel quite uncomfortable, 5 boards and he has been dummy three times|pg||
nt|burry1975: for an active player like him, quite an agony|pg||
pc|h3|pc|d7|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s4|pc|sJ|pc|sK|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s9|nt|xenya: 1o tricks now|pg||
pc|s6|nt|jeanhari: dbl squeeze here|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|cA|nt|rnmalik: for EW 3@C was the contract|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c9|pc|cT|pg||
pc|d8|pc|s3|pc|h4|pc|d6|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|xenya: if N ruffs in now it's 2 down|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|c3|pc|s8|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h9|pc|h2|pc|h5|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c5|pc|h6|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|jeanhari: single squeeze on N works too|pg||
mc|7|nt|xenya: well done |pg||
pg||

nt|sybarra: wow!   not like Neth. |pg||
nt|sybarra: making way too many |pg||
nt|jeanhari: could als have play club, ace of spades, club back and then the last diamond|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: thats that global warming stuff  LOL|pg||
nt|burry1975: I'd open the north hand 1D|pg||
nt|sybarra: remember they play Tiger club,  he may have the option but may not |pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: Paulissen put down 2@S first, then wanted to bid 1@S, now de Wijs has called the TD|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C!|nt|po-s: slams|pg||
nt|burry1975: 6spades for EW here.. but will be quite some competition in the bidding once more|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: Hey PO :)|pg||
nt|burry1975: they may be pushed there ...|pg||
nt|po-s: 7D on spade lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: I don't know what the TD has said, it all took place outside of the play room. However, Paulissen has bid 2@S|pg||
nt|burry1975: de wijs duly agreed with 1D:-) now they should try to get 3n in his hand|pg||
nt|burry1975: only down with club lead I think|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  At the other table on board 17 South did open 1@h and they doubled 4@s for 300 and 6 imps|pg||
nt|xenya: strong @C?|pg||
mb|3D|nt|sybarra: 2 @C=  weak with @D |pg||
nt|sybarra: (or stong)  but we know better|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 4@H makeable?|pg||
nt|xenya: yes it is i'm told|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|burry1975: indeed 7 on a spade lead, 3d on a club lead|pg||
nt|burry1975: heart is probably good enough too.... |pg||
nt|xenya: NS can make a few tricks in a heart contract here|pg||
mb|4D|mb|4H|nt|sybarra: someone may X this |pg||
nt|xenya: and they are going to get to 4|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3@S means?|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: the only winning defence against 4@H is 3 rounds of spades -- unlikely to be found|pg||
nt|xenya: i may be wrong, sorry |pg||
nt|nigel_k:  West now choosing between 4NT and 5@d|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  5@d will be easier as North is endplayed even if you get clubs wrong|pg||
nt|xenya: yes|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  In 4NT the spade finesse is the tenth trick but declarer may not wish to play for that|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzbt: @C lead not unlikely by W|pg||
mb|p|pc|dJ|nt|sharkey: W's 4@C rather aggressive I think - @S lead called for|pg||
nt|xenya: that would be definitely against the odds -- but is there another chance|pg||
nt|xenya: my guess it's hearts |pg||
pc|d3|nt|sharkey: not easy from Qxx|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure @S lead with qxx comes to mind |pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry for the echo |pg||
nt|sharkey: If E has the guts to risk @C finesse...|pg||
nt|burry1975: if he has...he can make|pg||
nt|sharkey: think off 1|pg||
nt|sybarra: club finesses and he can...."all in"  as they say in poker |pg||
nt|sharkey: indxeed|pg||
nt|sharkey: ruff 2 @D and 2 @S losers|pg||
nt|sharkey: plus 2 red losers|pg||
nt|burry1975: use the 4th club to draw trumps|pg||
nt|sybarra: well we probably have time to get coffee while he thinks |pg||
nt|sybarra: brb|pg||
nt|sharkey: may be dinner too...|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Anyway the club lead will not test declarer too much|pg||
pc|d5|nt|xenya: i wonder why N chose that lead -- it seemed S's double was not penalty |pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Yep transfer to @H|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|c7|nt|xenya: another tricky contract|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|rnmalik: would you DBL 2@D or bid 2@S|pg||
nt|rnmalik: requires play|pg||
pc|c5|nt|jeanhari: 4@H cold but the bidding was not that strange|pg||
nt|jeanhari: I think most will bid 2@S|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: Would probably X, though 2@S gets kudos too, in my book|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cJ|nt|xenya: right|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
pc|s3|nt|burry1975: 300 is a bargain|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sK|nt|burry1975: well...he decided not too....now down 2|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I have done my best but cannot count to 10 tricks:)|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|c4|nt|xenya: i'm still trying|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sharkey: getting short in trumps too|pg||
pc|h6|pc|c8|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h3|nt|sybarra: he may ruff and lead a sp now |pg||
nt|sybarra: or any old shoe = -1 |pg||
pc|h5|nt|rnmalik: I would DBL and still have a rebid in @S|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 2@S and a @D cannot be avoided|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like only 9|pg||
nt|xenya: yes |pg||
nt|vugraphzbt: sorry, we'll need to restart again after this board. sorry for the inconvenience|pg||
nt|xenya: this may well be a push -- 4@H looks a decent contract and should be reached in th OR too i think|pg||
pc|s8|pc|c9|pc|s2|pc|sT|pg||
nt|xenya: it's ok -- we are already used to it|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s9|pc|cQ|pc|s4|pg||
