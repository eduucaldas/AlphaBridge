mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|lml: West will likely bid a heavy 2@C|pg||
mb|3C|nt|lml: and then East will get do something to show his happiness|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: that 1NT may be a transfer|pg||

mb|4H|nt|yo_yo: it looks as if they know the A@D is missing|pg||
nt|lml: the question is could there be any confusion about 4NT|pg||
nt|lml: do they have a way to ask for aces|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: they have set @C as trumps  |pg||
