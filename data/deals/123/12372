mb|1C|mb|2H|mb|d!|nt|jbgood: hi|pg||
nt|eggy: not too shy with his WJO style, Crouch !|pg||
nt|jbgood: seems like a good suit compared to what you may see|pg||
nt|dburn: may possibly result in East-West reaching 4@s, perhaps the least comfortable game contract|pg||
mb|3D!|mb|3S|nt|jbgood: W will suggest 3 nt now|pg||
nt|dburn: he might do, but those diamonds have become a cause for concern|pg||
nt|jbgood: sure - but still|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: good decision|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|nt|jbgood: best defense is to cash 3 dis - not now|pg||
nt|dburn: and North, having bid 3@d for the lead, forgot to lead one|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h9|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|pc|cA|pc|cT|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cQ|pc|c3|pc|c6|pg||
mc|13|nt|dburn: so Hastings has the rest|pg||
nt|eggy: indeed, although I auppose that the diamond position would mean that the defence couldn't force enough anyway in 4S|pg||
pg||
qx|c17|st||md|3S32HJT7653DJT6C64,SA75HKQ9D8543CAKJ,ST864H842DAK92CQT,SKQJ9HADQ7C987532|sv|o|nt|lestergold: id be surprised if this wasnt bid in oppen|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|lestergold: However e/w are up to an experienced international partnership who have evn played i believe in thye bermuda bowl |pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|roswolf: the english played in a moysian fit|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|ady: likely to be a similar result to OR|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: certainly played in many major international events and rcently as i said brought back a gold medal from Brazil no mean achievement|pg||
nt|ady: reached 4@S   on 4-3 fit in OR      3NT  with the 5 heart tricks available will make|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|mayors: XX = 1@h response, 1@h probably 3 cards|pg||
mb|3C|nt|Walddk4: Good afternoon to Heather Dhondy|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Are EW hooked of now? Y|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  man's decision from S - let's see how would be the play|pg||
nt|ppiglett: What was Rdble - T/f?|pg||
nt|mayors: yes xfer|pg||
nt|heatherd: Hi All|pg||
nt|ady: hi|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2N rebid would be simpler but maybe Brunner isthinking of possibility of club slam|pg||
nt|ady: may judge to play in clubs    |pg||
mb|3H|nt|jackthelad: nice lie of the cards for N/S|pg||
nt|ady: redouble show hearts?|pg||
nt|lestergold: E/W can make 3N or 4S 3n seems a more normal spot|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6 will be tempting if 3n is bypassed and it makes of course on a non diamond lead|pg||
nt|ady: would 2NT be forcing?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: e/w   may stop short of game     not that unreaasonable|pg||
nt|roswolf: enjoying being npc heather?|pg||
nt|lestergold: however north would be able to double for a dim lead|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mayors: Yes 4+ @hs|pg||
nt|ady: thx|pg||
mb|p|nt|heatherd: I'm not doing it until the 2nd weekend. Hopefully I'll be taking over with the team in a good position!|pg||
nt|roswolf: this auction is meandering somewhat|pg||
nt|lestergold: well David its a combined 26 count and thats dabgerous not to play gam,e at teams|pg||
nt|lestergold: and unusual|pg||
mb|4C|nt|heatherd: I'm sure EW will wind up in 3NT somehow|pg||
nt|ady: there is 26 hcp   between them   but it appears they are not definately aware   and the hands dont fit well|pg||
nt|lestergold: u are right david no it wouldnt it was a silly suggestion|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: well he has passed|pg||
nt|heatherd: OK, wrong again!|pg||
mb|4H|nt|marlowepi: especially with E playing heart 8|pg||
nt|mayors: The red honours lay very well for NS|pg||
nt|ady: club lead makes life difficult|pg||
nt|mayors: Yes 2@h more awkward than 2@d, a bit surpised crouch preferred @hs|pg||
nt|ppiglett: The hand lies will for 2H, on the nose for 110 and a flat board my prediction. Any wagers?|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Hugh must go looking for a diamond ruff holding trump control|pg||
nt|mayors: I expect 8 tricks I think|pg||
nt|ppiglett: might sorry!|pg||
nt|ady: might go wrong on a club lead  and further club s from defence|pg||
nt|mayors: On club lead may play to ruff three clubs in dummy|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Wont get the ruff, I agree club will put S under pressure|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well they are not going to recove their deficit playing games in part sxcores even if the games dont come with a bank of scotland guarantee|pg||
nt|lestergold: well thye are on the way|pg||
mb|4S|nt|lestergold: well Holland play Brunner for the KD|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|nt|ady: should stop now    but if diamonds are led cant afford a misguess in clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well no reason not to play for drop in clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: dims wont be led|pg||
nt|ady: should be if cu bids are to be trusted|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|lestergold: commentators curse|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ady: England will lose 3 imps at best|pg||
pc|dK|nt|marlowepi: always going to make with spade ten doubleton|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lestergold: maybe altho dims was fitrst suit bid by dummy the cue bids identified the weakness|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d6|pc|d4|pg||
pc|d9|nt|marlowepi: even on club lead|pg||
pc|c5|pc|dT|pc|d5|pg||
nt|roswolf: the scottish e/w have been somewhat subdued in this match so far|pg||
nt|heatherd: It seems to me that West should be driving game after partner's 2@d bid - clearly showing extras|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|nt|lestergold: im not doing too well today|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cT|pg||
nt|lestergold: I agree Heather|pg||
nt|roswolf: agreed|pg||
nt|ady: England supporters dont want Holland to go back to hand|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h2|pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
nt|lestergold: west should have bid 3S which gives east a choice opf games|pg||
nt|garnetts: 3NT was as good as this |pg||
pc|c3|nt|lestergold: well there is some argument here about restricted choice with club ten appearing but....|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|lestergold: will he yes he did|pg||
mc|10|nt|lestergold: oh well big swing|pg||
pg||
qx|o18|st||md|4SKJ2H2DKJ8764CA87,S64H973D52CJT9432,ST85HAKQJTDAQTCQ5,SAQ973H8654D93CK6|sv|n|mb|p|mb|2D!|nt|dburn: indeed, and the spade position meant that if declarer were to discard on the third diamond, the defence could not force a trump guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: 2@d is naturalish - opening bid values with 6+ diamonds or 5-4 in the minors|pg||
mb|2H!|mb|p|nt|dburn: 2@h is natural with either hearts or a game force in support of diamonds, or in this case both|pg||
mb|3D!|mb|p|nt|dburn: and slam is cold in three denominations, but better played by South - no difference here, of course|pg||
nt|dburn: the difficulty will be for Patterson to discover that South has the black suits not only stopped, but controlled|pg||
nt|jbgood: 3 @h now -. and 4 @d over 3 nt?|pg||
nt|dburn: the trouble is that if he bids 4@d and hears 4@s, he won't know about clubs|pg||
mb|3S!|mb|d|nt|jbgood: y - not easy|pg||
nt|dburn: not sure about 3@s at all|pg||
nt|eggy: Still with only a 4 count possible in the reds, He knows that a t least a King and an Ace are pretty likely|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|nt|jbgood: the system has created a problem - I guess S could not rebid 2 NT over the 2@h realy|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: the trouble now is that North has no way to tell whether South's spades are KJx or QJx|pg||
mb|p|pc|s6|nt|dburn: but if they were the latter, five would be going down, so he might as well have bid six|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
pc|s7|nt|jbgood: should S not have a control for 5 @c?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|eggy: I guess that Patterson was worried about missing AK in spades, but then it was likely 5D wouldn't make either|pg||
nt|dburn: in spades? no|pg||
mc|12|pg||
qx|c18|st||md|4SKJ2H2DKJ8764CA87,S64H973D52CJT9432,ST85HAKQJTDAQTCQ5,SAQ973H8654D93CK6|sv|n|nt|april7: very light openings nowadays, but might come out alright, one present was already given, so with 10 of @S favourable the contract is made|pg||
nt|marlowepi: would be made without the present|pg||
nt|mayors: No I don't think so|pg||
nt|mayors: South always was going to score a second @s trick|pg||
nt|lestergold: and the extra whammy of playingt in a nisht machen part score|pg||
nt|heatherd: He could have bid 3@d though|pg||
nt|lestergold: he had plenty of bids better than pass|pg||
nt|lestergold: i sympathise|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: neck und neck now|pg||
nt|ady: another swing for theIrish|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|heatherd: Another promising result for Englad here.|pg||
nt|lestergold: i like 3s because it cant be nmisunderstood |pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|lestergold: and could be here|pg||
nt|lestergold: too|pg||
mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|ady: one of the defenders needed a 14th club|pg||
nt|lestergold: as cards lie 6 of red infrangible|pg||
mb|2D|nt|mayors: 2@c another xfer|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Take second spade, play the king and a heart to the ten and cash the DQ - one down no?|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3N will be fine|pg||
nt|heatherd: 10@d lead in the other room, thank you very much!|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: 3N a better contract than 5C|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes lucky for the english|pg||
nt|ady: 5C got through in OR     north lead a diamond|pg||
nt|heatherd: Much better.|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes 3nt is where you would choose to play i think|pg||
nt|lestergold: played by south any red slam is excellent|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|yo_yo: i could get to like this |pg||
nt|jackthelad: interesting decison to open 1|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and without the opening bid, game could easily be missed|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  in 3rd seat - looks well |pg||
nt|april7: thats right|pg||
nt|marlowepi: seems normal to open 1|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it is not good strategy to advertise weakness in 3rd seat facing a passed hand, esp at these colours|pg||
nt|lestergold: cant blame the 5C bid with a top heavy hand fearful of letting opps in with the majors|pg||
nt|lestergold: even no trumps|pg||
nt|ady: 6@D   or 6NT from south unbeatable   6NT best|pg||
mb|p|nt|jackthelad: wouldn't occur to me....rubber or imps....bash|pg||
nt|mayors: No, west had 4 spades and can only get rid of one of the @d Q|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6N completely frigid against any lie|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|ady: on some lays 3NT would go down with 5 of a minor making|pg||
nt|roswolf: but not today|pg||
nt|lestergold: Many would take same action as Crouch did|pg||
nt|garnetts: 3NT bid makes it clear --maybe 3@D after 1NT would show 6-5|pg||
mb|p|nt|ppiglett: You're right sorry|pg||
nt|ady: some imps for england here    irosh down in both rooms|pg||
nt|lestergold: harder to bid no trump slam as point count only 30|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: oops|pg||
nt|lestergold: but 6D looks like a reasonable contract to reach|pg||
pc|s6|nt|lestergold: what happened here operator is this for real?|pg||
nt|ady: partnership misunderstanding     lucky for England|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgk: South's sighs tell me yes|pg||
pc|s5|nt|lestergold: good try by Price|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
nt|lestergold: North's 3D forcing in my book|pg||
pc|s3|nt|yo_yo: it's like a speedball|pg||
nt|lestergold: but pards hearts not god enough|pg||
pc|sK|nt|vugraphzgk: you missed a lot at the start|pg||
pc|s4|nt|marlowepi: of all weak 2 bids, 2H is the least effective. less preemptive than 2S, and unlike 2D it helps the opps by reducing their principal targets to just ONE major and NT|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|heatherd: Yes. If East hadn't had the 10@h this was needed.|pg||
nt|lestergold: especially after 2S force|pg||
mc|12|nt|mayors: 3@h showed a mixed raise about 6-8 with 4 trumps|pg||
pg||
qx|o19|st||md|1SKT964HQ986D32C75,SJ7HAK54D9876CA42,SAQ52HJ32DA4CQJ86,S83HT7DKQJT5CKT93|sv|e|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|dburn: weak no trump by the look of it - 2@c probably majors|pg||
nt|jbgood: must admit I have some sympathy for this kibs' statement: too much science, odds with jump to 6 straight away|pg||
nt|eggy: Patterson would like to make a try, but that will get him too high|pg||
nt|dburn: well, 3@s was a complete mystery - don't know why he could not bid 3@h|pg||
mb|2S|nt|dburn: but no doubt the dreaded Crouch has some meaning for that unrelated to hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|eggy: Perhaps he was trying to see if he got a double and then let that affect his decision|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|dK|nt|dagold: 3@h may have been non-forcing with long hearts?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|dburn: not sure what East is doing here - why sell to 2@s when partner has a weak no trump?|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dA|pg||

pc|hT|pc|h6|pc|hK|pc|h2|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|pc|c3|pc|c5|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|jbgood: guess E is the only one with an answer to that, David|pg||
mc|8|nt|dburn: and the opponents might compete to 3@s and go down, of course|pg||
pg||

nt|lestergold: Price is correct to try and beat contract if its possible he will usually find the right card|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgk: S muttering|pg||
mb|p|nt|mayors: Catchall @d from south|pg||
nt|lestergold: both blaming each other?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgk: can't hear N!|pg||
mb|1N|nt|lestergold: I see Price Simpson play a fairly natural system with 4 card majors|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: of course they are both outstanding money players|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk4: http://www.camrosebridge.com/  for a website with lots of useful information|pg||
nt|marlowepi: offense-defense ratio is not skewed toward former, may turn plus into minus (maybe a big one), may push opps to a game they wont bid if i open ne|pg||
nt|lestergold: well another swing to england here|pg||
nt|ady: England did well to buy in 2@S OR     3@D for e/w makes|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ady: if Simpson plays 3NT    defence might win leading a spade    |pg||
pc|c3|nt|garnetts: 3NT might well show this  with three card support in the old days --suspect it means somehting else now|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cA|pg||
nt|mayors: 2@d shows @hs, Crouch/Patterson play transfers in just about every conceivable situation|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ady: will need to play K@H to make 3NT   |pg||
nt|garnetts: also like the OR it is wrong sided |pg||
pc|d4|nt|heatherd: Spade lead will give problems.|pg||
nt|ady: spade lead    and heart back   and 2nd spade|pg||
nt|lestergold: spade lead as expected on the auction|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|pg||
nt|lestergold: Crouch at fave vul made a very aggressice major suit showing bid with then 5 count eh was dealt and hit gold dust with pard|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ady: spades 5-3   would have made life more difficult|pg||
nt|ady: wonder if East will lead Q@D|pg||
nt|mayors: Might do, must be thinking about it|pg||
nt|heatherd: Weak NT auction in the other room gave no info for the lead.|pg||
nt|garnetts: The down side of playing a 3NT gadget then |pg||
nt|lestergold: west must win first heart|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ppiglett: definitely thinking about it - yes|pg||
nt|mayors: J from QJ|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dA|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|jackthelad: ultra conservatve wins out here|pg||
mc|8|nt|ady: was going to make anyway   but if head done that without Q! and west had Q! then that would have let game through|pg||
nt|ady: Q@H|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Who was Rusinov?|pg||
nt|ppiglett: true and south was certain to hold 3/4 diamonds from the bidding, more likely to be 4.|pg||
nt|lestergold: its off|pg||
pg||

mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|d|mb|p|nt|dburn: well, North-South can make a slam, so of course East-West are in a game|pg||
nt|jbgood: good double by Crouch |pg||

nt|dburn: East doubtless hoping for a trick on the lead and seven hearts to go with it, but he was taking a massive risk|pg||

nt|lestergold: trappy hand for E/W the duplication in cluibs meaning their points arent pulling their full weight|pg||
nt|heatherd: Tricky hand this. Values for game, but nothing obvious on.|pg||
nt|ady: England tried the only game with a chance in OR  |pg||
nt|heatherd: 4@h has more play|pg||
nt|lestergold: crouch's bid was reasonable his pard wa marked with strength|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgk: Michelle said she wasn't going to risk it - just claimed +1|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 4@H   unlucky|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ady: seems like some accident in OR     this should be another sing for England|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well N/S can make a slam but if they dont this will be expensive for N Ireland|pg||
mb|2D|nt|ppiglett: very|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: spade and diamond high cards badly placed|pg||
nt|lestergold: reaching 4S seems fairly likely as in open|pg||
nt|lestergold: Campbell opening 3 with the festering west hand vul is one thing but standing the double of 3N!! chm....|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm...|pg||
mb|2N|nt|lestergold: on a good day it might roll in but with spaes breaking 4/2 no chance here|pg||
nt|paulales: think you are in the right country - it is -15 here :( and by all accounts not much better in England|pg||
mb|p|nt|mayors: Looks like downgrade from North they play 14/16 NT 1st/2nd|pg||
nt|lestergold: not easy to bid thias pretty good slam|pg||
nt|lestergold: but with double fit identifie should get there|pg||
nt|ady: west oppened 3@H in OR    and east tried 3NT   might have retreated to 4@H  when doubled   still -800|pg||
mb|3D|nt|jackthelad: WOW...no mucking about !|pg||
nt|ppiglett: If 2D is a t/f then is North worth 3H or 4?|pg||
nt|ady: will be push |pg||
nt|lestergold: well north needs to show some dim support pdq|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulales: sorry|pg||
nt|ady: cant see where 4@H has more play   needs finess and break   4@S   just the 3-3 break|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|jackthelad: but Douglas is not renowned for tact :)|pg||
nt|mayors: Well the hand has got better with @h and 3 small @Ss|pg||
mb|4S|nt|yo_yo: if only we had the comparisons|pg||
nt|lestergold: 800 a great profit against the vul slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|ppiglett: The three small spades look good - all cards working etc etc|pg||
nt|lestergold: push on the way|pg||

nt|ady: 9@C|pg||
nt|Walddk8: We think 6@D can make double dummy on any lead|pg||

pc|d2|nt|jackthelad: W cant believe his luck...but E will exit to @h, and that is that|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  does 3NT mean something special like "good @h fit" or is W just counting till 9 (tricks)? |pg||
nt|vugraphzgk: 3NT explained to South as "not in system"|pg||
nt|lestergold: they desrev to make it if they bid well enought to reach it|pg||
nt|lestergold: and its looking likely|pg||
nt|heatherd: Deosn't 6NT require South to put up the K@s on the first round? Not easy if played early.|pg||
nt|heatherd: To defeat it|pg||
nt|lestergold: there is an end play indeed Heathe rif not|pg||
nt|ady: obviously you can finesse 9@D early   then ruff a heart  and make 12 tricks   but who is going to play that way|pg||
nt|lestergold: but its all a bit double dummyiash|pg||
nt|heatherd: Looks like they're heading for 6@d. That'll be interesting|pg||
nt|lestergold: whatever the result 6D will be well bid and very unlucky when it probably goes off|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh dear|pg||

nt|ady: assume Simpson wont lead a diamond|pg||
nt|lestergold: er i dont er think so|pg||

nt|heatherd: I imagine 2@d 2@h 2@s was Baron (cancelling the oroginal message about @h|pg||
nt|lestergold: nor he either|pg||
nt|roswolf: 6nt is a practical shot it seems to me - south will do really well to find the defence as heather says|pg||
nt|heatherd: Now 3@d was lowest 4-card suit, and 4@d agreed @d|pg||
nt|Walddk8: Yes Heather, or to unblock the king if the ace is cashed|pg||

nt|lestergold: ruff with ace its cold|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  from S's point of view, partner can well have @s Q and @c ace|pg||
pc|c6|nt|lestergold: all over |pg||

nt|lestergold: no im being silly|pg||
pc|c2|nt|heatherd: There's still the endplay though|pg||
nt|Walddk8: But against a North who would NEVER play the jack from J10x, immediate finesse is actually the percentage play, says Michael Rosenberg|pg||
nt|lestergold: now must try the spade and hope to catch simpson|pg||
nt|heatherd: Same as in 6NT, South must unblock the K@s|pg||

nt|Walddk8: Please explain 2@C someone|pg||
nt|heatherd: Yes, and they have done reasonably well to bid it.|pg||
nt|lestergold: all declarer needs to do is lose a ound of spades cash ace and  then play on minors eventually ruffing the third club in dummy|pg||
nt|lestergold: maybe north ghas felt in both roomsm that hand is too good for 4S opener need texas to ewal with these hands|pg||

mb|3H|nt|Walddk8: I haven't seen this before|pg||
mb|p|nt|heatherd: I imagine that 2@c must show the other 2 suits. How this is different from double in their system, I don't know. I guess this must show 5@s judging by Price's response|pg||

nt|Walddk8: Maybe I am naive but a 1@S overcall is normal for most people. If it goes all pass after that, which game do you think you have missed?|pg||
nt|ady: as kibs have pointed out   also make if the diamonds are 4-2 but the 4 diamonds are with the 3 spades|pg||

nt|heatherd: Hard to comment when I don't know exactly what their agreements are about 2@c|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|lestergold: a lot of debate aboutt hyen bidding from specs|pg||
nt|ady: west unsure about the club position|pg||
nt|lestergold: Price/simpson are natural and imaginative bidders|pg||

nt|Vugraphzgk: Simpson looking at N hand from last|pg||
mb|1D|nt|yo_yo: neither do I sheila|pg||
nt|lestergold: risk of giving away the 9th trick against the risk of giving away acrucial tempo- its not pairs |pg||
mb|1S|mb|d|mb|4S|nt|ady: e/w  should be able to make 4@H   |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: bid as a sac but makes as cards lie|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ady: fortunate heart position allows 10 tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: fairly routine 4H to bid and make I would have thought|pg||
nt|lestergold: thx to all well place minor suit Ks|pg||
pc|d2|nt|lestergold: 4H maes on any line|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ppiglett: 4S actually a lucky make e-w but unbiddable|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ady: if East is declarer  a diamond lead would be best   but still should make|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d7|nt|jackthelad: good pass...very tempting to bid 2@h|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|d3|nt|lestergold: but with west as declarer there is no defence |pg||
pc|c2|nt|ady: even better with west declarer|pg||
nt|lestergold: had east been declarer and received a diamond l;ead east would not to esclude south from getting in again|pg||
nt|lestergold: and would have to play the hearts accordingly which would have been successful here|pg||
pc|s5|pc|d4|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|marlowepi: after the pass over 1S, game is remote, so not that hard to resist any temptation S may have felt to bid 2H|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jackthelad: easy from up here....but much harder at the table :)|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sK|pg||
pc|h6|nt|lestergold: Im told that David Walker has played in 28 out of last 20 camroses and is a three time gold cup winner|pg||
nt|lestergold: thx to spec for that info|pg||
nt|lestergold: 28 0ut of last 29 sorry|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hK|pc|h9|pg||
nt|ady: with west so short of entries will be forced to the winning line  playing hearts from the top|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ady: now easier|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|pc|h4|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dJ|mc|10|nt|ady: Price had to attack diamonds  to have any hope|pg||
nt|lestergold: likely to be a push|pg||
