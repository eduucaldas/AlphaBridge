nt|vugrapha3: last board of the set|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, declarer could have made it by spurning the club finesse, but that would have been wrong if the club had been away from the king|pg||

nt|ahollan1:  i don't even remember seeing this session on the vugraph schedule|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  this WAS a bonus session of vugraph|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  thanks to Nick Fahrer and the ABF gang for letting us enjoy the extra sets|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  it is confirmed -- no more sessions today|pg||

mb|1C|mb|p|nt|ahollan1:  it doesn't apply with DBL, but Bruce Neill authored the convention known as Rubensohl [aka Transfer Lebensohl]|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|beauch:  yes played by a few leading pairs|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1:  but curiously - not so much by Bruce :)|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c4|pc|cT|pc|c3|pg||
nt|beauch:  maybe east auction shows a balanced hand with weak nt range- hence wests 2h bid?|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  show of hands -- how many would rebid 2@H with West?|pg||
nt|beauch:  his partners seniors and cant remember it :)|pg||
nt|beauch:  only 1>?|pg||

nt|beauch:  good contract on this heart layout|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ahollan1:  honestly - even if 1@S guaranteed unbalanced hand, i'd rebid 1N without a 2nd thought|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c5|pc|c2|pc|cJ|pg||

nt|ahollan1:  maybe Neill was hoping EW had read Larry Cohen's book - i.e. 4@H forces opp to bid 4@S :)|pg||
nt|beauch:  yes not tempted this time|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  now if declarer can just find a way not to lose the trump ace|pg||
mc|9|nt|ahollan1:  guess not|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|ahollan1:  i suspect disliked combination of 6322 shape AND mediocre @C suit|pg||

nt|ahollan1:  confession time -- I would open 2@C [and i know at least one of our big club kibitzers would too]|pg||
nt|beauch:  east might play a low h|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  oh good -- another 2N contract|pg||
nt|bigtrain: KNR values the hand as 12.20 - well withing opening bid range|pg||
nt|beauch:  do you play a precision system|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s7|pc|s3|pc|sA|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  especially since Polish 2@C opener has narrow range - ala Precision 2@C|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|nt|bigtrain: y - but i would open regardless of system|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hT|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s6|pc|sJ|pc|c4|pg||
pc|h4|pc|dK|nt|bigtrain: polish & precision 2@C just make it safer as the bid is limited|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h8|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c8|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
nt|beauch:  true- playing standard may get overboard occasionally|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  i'm a bit surprised Kanetkar didn't have a way to get out in 3@D|pg||
mc|7|nt|beauch:  ah avi kanetkar plays stayman and blackwwod- not a bidding scintist|pg||
nt|beauch:  scientist|pg||
nt|ahollan1:  in that case - maybe he should PASS 1@C|pg||
nt|beauch:  his bidding like my typing!|pg||
