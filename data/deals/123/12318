nt|joemanjo: This looks like a West Bengal vs Delhi match. NS and EW respectively.|pg||
pc|dK|nt|varange: welcome to the Swedish Premier League.|pg||
nt|joemanjo: Hi all|pg||
pc|d8|nt|kaapo: 1NT is about 17-19 here I suppose|pg||
nt|col3435: at least declarer has something to think about on this lead|pg||
nt|varange: NS played pretty slowly during the previous session|pg||
nt|othered1: Looks like they're headed for an easy 4@S|pg||
nt|joemanjo: EW qualified to represent India once at China, four years back.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|joemanjo: EW play stong club|pg||
nt|joemanjo: strong|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|kaapo: Straightforward bidding|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  Hello, Markku. Good evening to all|pg||
nt|kaapo: Did 3NT show clubs or @S shortness or something else?|pg||
nt|joemanjo: NS okay Standard methods|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|varange: which meant that the OR caught up|pg||
nt|kaapo: 1NT = clubs or GF relay?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sfoxa:  Hello, Kari.|pg||
pc|s9|nt|mmmakela: 3433 and 9 with no intermeds|pg||
nt|mcphee: 3nt a nice spot|pg||
nt|xenya: good stop but still an awkward contract|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes shd be a flat bd which is a good news for Khandelwals|pg||
nt|othered1: Possible without @C system for north to be declarer, but on this hand it doesn't matter|pg||
nt|joemanjo: +120 in 1N|pg||
mc|8|nt|kaapo: Hi Cornelia, Markku and Staffan|pg||
nt|chick: hard to pass with 2 aces though|pg||
nt|chick: and a lively first round of bidding dies quite suddenly|pg||
nt|rnc: For Running Scores, time schedule etc during the tournament: http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_plugins/content/content.php?content.877|pg||
nt|kaapo: Hi|pg||
nt|mmmakela: only guess who might have all 3 trumps|pg||

nt|vugraphzpx: i would say they are pretty good, noone knows how good he is in a speedy :) I can ask him though... :)|pg||
nt|chick: Hello Everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: if south has 5 spades, the best way must be to play the 8 of clubs and let it go round to north|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: or even a small one|pg||
nt|col3435: yes that's nice|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes and the favoriates are trailing makes it more interesting|pg||
nt|joemanjo: EW partnership is quite a long standing one in Indian Bridge. East, Mr Ashok Goel is the CEO of Dhampur Sugar Mills and sponsor for their team.|pg||
mb|1C|nt|chick: nice 4@H contract here|pg||
nt|kaapo: Rehi Cornelia|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  hello, Cornelia|pg||
nt|kaapo: 1NT looks interesting|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 1 nt seems needing swings|pg||
nt|kaapo: What does that show, then? :)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  if E decided to open 1nt, good ending could be 3nt |pg||
nt|kaapo: 10-13, might be off-shap?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  guess @d right - "only"|pg||
nt|joemanjo: What wd u open as North?|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: yes, 26 imps can be found in 14 boards without doing much more than playing good bridge and getting a little lucky to have active hands.|pg||
mb|1H|nt|kaapo: Well, no need to interfere with his play :)|pg||
nt|frankaus: g'day all|pg||
nt|kaapo: North may get to open here, unless West finds 1@H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@C|pg||
nt|joemanjo: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: need to reach 5@D |pg||
nt|chick: is he known as a particularly slow player?  :)|pg||
nt|xenya: the 3@D preempt in the other room was overdoing it|pg||
nt|joemanjo: u can follow this tourney at the following website|pg||
nt|joemanjo: http://indianbridgepages.appspot.com/ Yashwant_Rao_Holkar/2010/Results.el|pg||
nt|joemanjo: 4@S may be reached here too. |pg||
mb|2H|an| |mb|p|nt|varange: hi Frank|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: I suppose Johan and PO at least play 2-way club|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: chick, sundelin is known as one of the slowest swedish players ever... :)|pg||
mb|d|nt|mmmakela: N won't sell|pg||
nt|mdgraham: curious no 1@s overcall by North|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: 2-way club, where 1@C shows either a strong hand or a weak notrump range, is often referred to as Swedish club|pg||
nt|joemanjo: 2@C and 2N take up valuable space to show a black two suiter.|pg||
nt|suketbombi: N-s have a good @S partial|pg||
nt|joemanjo: ah that 3@s made it simple|pg||
nt|joemanjo: Had East not opened, NS may have wandered into a 4@s game.|pg||
nt|joemanjo: now they may settle in @s partial|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|mmmakela: 14-16 Nt maybe?|pg||
nt|chick: certainly doesn't look like a hand that I would upgrade|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: 13-17NT from start, 2@D showed 13-15 without 4c major|pg||
nt|chick: :)|pg||
nt|mcphee: PO thinks his partners minor is @C:)|pg||
nt|chick: good thing I don't have a lot to do today then :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I am told NS play VERY sound overcalls - and it surely seems so|pg||
nt|joemanjo: wow|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: I guess 1NT = 14-16|pg||
nt|kaapo: Some might bid some number of diamonds as West|pg||
nt|kaapo: Even if East doesn't lead a club, he'll get another chance|pg||
nt|kaapo: Unless he ducks a spade|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: this board is wrong duplicated. Not much, but the ace of heart is located at east, not at south|pg||
nt|kaapo: Makes a little more sense then|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  single?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: south stole the 9 of D from east|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: so east holds 3253 with A7 in hearts|pg||
nt|kaapo: Mikael and Cilla are in the minority for Swedish experts: they don't play strong/2-way club|pg||
nt|kaapo: Their system of choice is short club with transfers|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: @D lead would have proved troublesome|pg||
nt|xenya: well if he decided to treat has hand as balanced, it makes sense|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|nt|xenya: whether it is balanced is doubtful though|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|pg||
nt|chick: almost any lead gives away a trick|pg||
nt|joemanjo: EW Bidding will certainly help the declarer in bringing off the 4@S|pg||
pc|c9|nt|kaapo: Well, unless the other room plays the board similarly distorted, this has to be canceled|pg||
nt|mmmakela: so S has 10982 in dias?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: it´s the same at all other tables.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: yes, south holds 10982 in @d|pg||
nt|suketbombi: a @C lead or shift wud restrict to 3 or else 4 makable|pg||
pc|cT|nt|jkmjanusz: Witam!|pg||
nt|vugraphzbf: witamy nowych komentatorów |pg||
nt|abunio: witamy z Gdanska :)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: ns play 2-way club Staffan? Carrot?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: 2@C asking for majors, 2@D relay with lots of different hands, 2@H/2@S/2NT/3@C/3@D invitational|pg||
nt|chick: and N puts him to the test immediately, before he can get any other info|pg||
nt|kaapo: Of couse he does have @DQ and might get a trick with it|pg||
nt|chick: but N still has to find the @DQ|pg||
nt|mcphee: sure, nice bold play before anyones knows what is up|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6@C makes but it's not great. It takes more than the heart finesse|pg||
pc|c6|nt|othered1: That's a *really* positional style|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|s9|nt|varange: choices choices|pg||
nt|xenya: all S's honours work and he knows it|pg||
pc|sA|nt|kaapo: @H8 looked discouraging|pg||
nt|chick: club switch still isn't clear though|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sfoxa:  so, we'll be unable to follow the play right - just enter result? |pg||
nt|kaapo: This seems to happen rarely but occasionally with the duplicating machines|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: we can follow the play as long as they wont play hearts... :)|pg||
nt|kaapo: In Beijing we had a normal bidding sequence and I ended up at 3NT|pg||
nt|mmmakela: we can until certain point but did S really pitch a dia|pg||
nt|kaapo: When I examined the dummy, I noticed our side had two diamond queens!|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: yes, south did pitch the 2 of @d|pg||
nt|mmmakela: very strange|pg||
nt|frankaus: still makes with 3@H 3@C 2@S + 1@D|pg||
nt|col3435: I guess you finish drawing trumps and try to cash some clubs, but when that doesn't work, what do you do?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Besides, if declarer is not careful, he may go down|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|chick: now should just lose the top trumps|pg||
nt|joemanjo: East wd have done well to put up the @h ten first round.|pg||
nt|joemanjo: @h8 rather|pg||
pc|h8|nt|tcpant: In the 2nd match Maya Meera Sneha leading by 77-47 against Khandelwal|pg||
pc|sT|nt|kaapo: It may get dangerous now, if he finesses trumps|pg||
nt|kaapo: Some also play Smith echo in the suit declarer first attacks (if count isn't relevant). If that's the case, @D2 might suggest finding another suit, too|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Must ruff one spade low and one high|pg||
nt|xenya: i think it's basically on a @H finesse -- barring something really bad in trumps or @Hs|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mcphee: going to be a costly misguess sadly|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|col3435: ruff the club out and play for the @dA to be right?|pg||
nt|joemanjo: Welcome to TC Pant|pg||
nt|tcpant: I will try... I am also busy with Pairs Scoring|pg||
nt|joemanjo: So we have the most exciting of the two semis here|pg||
nt|joemanjo: I need to leave now. Anyone who can join in for commentary, pls inform the VG operator.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|kaapo: Hmm, he attacked @S first :)|pg||
nt|varange: oops|pg||
pc|d5|nt|kaapo: On the other hand he seems to be home now if trumps are 3-2|pg||
nt|chick: one more round of trump, then set up clubs?|pg||
nt|col3435: of course you can get away with anything as the cards lie|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ralfwil: I had prefered to signal for a @d shift by playing @s10|pg||
nt|kaapo: Yes, black suits were a bit bad but anything else is right|pg||
nt|suketbombi: here is a happy man with T tricks|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|hT|pc|s4|nt|kaapo: Seems a reasonable plan|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|mmmakela: and a heart maybe|pg||
nt|joemanjo: could have ducked a round of hearts too|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|d2|nt|chick: needed to take his pitches on the minor winners before another trump|pg||
pc|d7|nt|Walddk2: Sorry, he can ruff two low|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mmmakela: well playing o/e 1st discard had no other convinient card I suppose but still bad|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But if spades were 6-2, that would fail|pg||

nt|kaapo: Here's an old convention card for NS. Could be that not much has changed: http://www.bridgeguys.com/pdf/CC/SylvanSundelin.pdf|pg||
nt|kaapo: But he had 1@S444 so he didn't really know what suit to pitch|pg||
nt|kaapo: Back in order here?|pg||
nt|col3435: oh, I wanted to see which diamond honour declarer would play!|pg||
nt|mdgraham: excellent 6@C slam NS|pg||
nt|joemanjo: lose a heart and a trump with a trump promotion looming now for -1.|pg||
nt|joemanjo: easier done than said (or typed)|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|col3435: a lot going on there, but I think declarer should foresee the result when pitching the heart|pg||
nt|xenya: lucky slam, but NS did well|pg||

mb|p|nt|ryskiel_: Darl es Santerm...to jaka arabska nazwa? |pg||
nt|chick: 4-5 @S,   6 if he can find the @SQ|pg||
nt|kaapo: In the signals section it states: |pg||
nt|kaapo: "We may combine discouragement and suit preference when known (or may be assumed) to be long in a suit; a high odd card shows preference for a high suit, a high even card for a low ...|pg||
nt|kaapo: suit - occurs rarely even if we should remember."|pg||
nt|kaapo: Will EW find diamonds?|pg||
nt|suketbombi: ask singleton|pg||
nt|othered1: Once you open the south hand, you should have a good run at it, unless system gets in the way|pg||
mb|1H|nt|jkmjanusz: Na drugom staole wygrali to 3BA|pg||

nt|varange: garbage stayman - with garbage|pg||

nt|suketbombi: atleast the effort is made here:)|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes thay play re transfet after 2nt rebid|pg||
nt|joemanjo: Welcome to Raju Tolani|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: I think 1@C is natural or balanced|pg||
nt|kaapo: And 1@H shows spades|pg||
nt|chick: which never works for me, but it seems to for everyone else :)|pg||
nt|frankaus: g'day all - |pg||
nt|varange: a clear violation of Burns' Law, Ralf?|pg||
nt|col3435: South must bid again here, but what?|pg||
nt|kaapo: EW might make 8 tricks in diamonds, so 5@D could be a reasonable save|pg||
nt|col3435: was difficult to do more though|pg||
nt|joemanjo: dbl worked |pg||
nt|xenya: agree -- double stands out|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Important for West to cover the @d 10|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Declarer needs one out of three suits 3-3 - but has to guess|pg||

nt|frankaus: had a side trip to spain - sorry i'm late|pg||

nt|varange: probably|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What does West have more than he already showed with 2@S?|pg||
nt|joemanjo: caused EW to panic|pg||
nt|suketbombi: kamal may be tempted to lead @C A on this auction to give away the contract:(|pg||
mb|p|nt|ryskiel_: uwielbiam takie licytacje jak patrzê z kornera|pg||

nt|col3435: I don't see anything too bad in this auction, it just doesn't happen to get there|pg||
nt|varange: yep|pg||
nt|kaapo: Try to establish spades or cross-ruff or both?|pg||
nt|col3435: I guess you can just see what develops|pg||
nt|suketbombi: now they enter murky waters|pg||
nt|mdgraham: a key moment in any slam auction is when you agree a trump suit |pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: i see i missed a grand :(|pg||
nt|mmmakela: @S K and then|pg||
nt|kaapo: They didn't, and neither did the open room|pg||
nt|frankaus: well not real garbagge and not short in @C so i would not  use it here|pg||
nt|varange: yep|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes! 1nt is good enough|pg||
nt|varange: Burns' Law: As declarer, one should strive to have more trumps than one's opponents|pg||
nt|varange: in some ways easier if playing the big 2NT, SAYC style|pg||
nt|xenya: if E is weak, he can take remove to 3@S -- the position is quite clear adter W's initial pass |pg||
pc|s9|pc|s3|nt|burypies: ale Witek im namiesza³ |pg||
nt|kaapo: 3@D might be 17-19 NT with 4 spades - but just guessing|pg||
nt|mcphee: make 3N i think|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|chick: not sure I would have led a trump on that auction|pg||
pc|h3|nt|kaapo: Without the double, North would bid 1@D to show 0-7. Difficult to tell what 1@S shows here|pg||
nt|suketbombi: got there :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well done - it looked as though that was touch-and-go for a moment|pg||
nt|othered1: Would be nice to know what their decision points were, but the result is just fine.|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hA|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Yuval Yener|pg||
nt|kaapo: Loser on loser play on the next spade?|pg||
nt|yuval10: hi all|pg||
nt|kaapo: Hi Yuval|pg||
nt|col3435: yeah, why not @sJ and run it if West follows low|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|chick: W might Q-ask |pg||
nt|kaapo: In case I was about right about the early bids, 3@H could be a re-tranafer and 3NT some kind of slam try follows by two cue bids|pg||
nt|kaapo: Fredin - Lindkvist had an even more straightforward sequence to 7@H|pg||
nt|col3435: but here west shows out, and if he allows the @h7 to score it's all over|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: west has the option of discarding 2 diamonds on the 3rd and 4th round of spade, denying the 6of H to score|pg||
nt|col3435: yep you're right|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ryskiel_: moimi prywatnymi faworytami s¹ licytacje sprzedajace te same walory po kilkakroæ|pg||
nt|kaapo: And 4@H could then be a "last train" kind of bid - still interested in slam but without a heart control|pg||
nt|kaapo: Apparently not much :)|pg||
nt|kaapo: So pitching a club here looks a reasonable plan|pg||
nt|yuval10: indeed|pg||
nt|col3435: hmm, there's too much to do though isn't there?|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 3@S showed a delayed support hence doubleton Honor and 4@H was quebid|pg||
nt|suketbombi: i assume|pg||
pc|c4|nt|burypies: ale Walerowicz 2 razy t¹ sam¹ kartê licytowa³|pg||
nt|mmmakela: E must consider the fact that in OR the most probable contract is 4 @S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North seemed to know what was going on, which is what counts.|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|col3435: or, just not enough tricks|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like 6 more tricks|pg||

nt|ralfwil: and a mistake from declarer|pg||
nt|ralfwil: he needed that entry!|pg||
nt|yuval10: despite all the efforts it seem like a dead end for declarer|pg||
pc|s4|nt|othered1: I'm told:  once singleton is shown, 2NT denies 3@s and 3@s denies 6@h|pg||

nt|arvid: well played, but didnt work this time|pg||
nt|kaapo: It was rather fancy but didn't make much of a difference|pg||
nt|chick: nope, but it might have|pg||
nt|varange: hi Rashed|pg||
nt|varange: it even makes 13 with a 3/2 break in diamonds|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Lucky layout for N-S in a spade contract. They can take 9 tricks|pg||
nt|suketbombi: no North did not sigh off he just bid 3@H as directed|pg||
nt|suketbombi: very very poor def by ashok Must say that|pg||
mb|1H|nt|Walddk2: Maybe even 10|pg||
nt|joemanjo: we are directed not to use that four letter word by BBO Raju :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: 4@S or 3NT here?|pg||
nt|kaapo: NS might end up at 4@H here|pg||
nt|mcphee: easy @S game, interesting to see how far N/S will push|pg||
nt|kaapo: 6@S could make but is missing two key cards|pg||
mb|1S|nt|chick: 4@H will look tasty to NS, but also to W |pg||
nt|ralfwil: first morning slam in @d|pg||
nt|col3435: perhaps South could bid 4@d over 3NT then.|pg||
nt|varange: I can see that N wouldnt be happy|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@S let through on board 2|pg||
nt|othered1: I guess north thinks this hand is too good for 15 point 1N.  I tend to agree|pg||
nt|suketbombi: the system is called Demicoma Destructive Minor Constructive Major|pg||
mb|d|nt|kaapo: Difficult to play either after 5@D|pg||
nt|kaapo: Ah, weren't we linked with the other table before?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: No|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like a @h partial for EW will be played here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Open room crashed|pg||
nt|kaapo: Well, back in action now, anyway :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: or perhaps 2@s from N|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Sunil Varghese|pg||
nt|joemanjo: any single major|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes |pg||
nt|joemanjo: 2@d|pg||
nt|suketbombi: single suiter Major|pg||
mb|4H|nt|varange: and hearts|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: hi all|pg||
nt|suketbombi: trf to @H this 4@D I guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|suketbombi: so 1D shows nothing about @Ds but atleast 1 or both Majors|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: Unlikely they'd get that high, though, unless really pushed|pg||
nt|mcphee: does the 2@S bid show game interest for @H?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: 2@S was pass/correct. |pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: 1@D, I believe, shows about 11-16 with 4+@D and an unbalanced hand|pg||
pc|c9|nt|chick: N will expect partner to have @s singleton|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: 10-15 actually|pg||
nt|mcphee: or just an invitation + for @H?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes, but @d is better|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: do i start with a Roland slam :) ?|pg||
nt|suketbombi: dont think subhsah will take any action|pg||
pc|c5|nt|mmmakela: supp dbl in spades|pg||
nt|chick: do you suppose 1@H is transfer advance showing spades?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: y|pg||
nt|kaapo: Nyström made a slight overbid with 4@D, but his @DAQ had grown in strength over 3@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: Wrang explained the 4@D wrong it seems, 4@D showed game forcing without short D|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: with spade support of course|pg||
nt|kaapo: 2@D Multi, showing a weak two in either of the majors (or perhaps some strong hand)|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 1nt denies Major unless 4-3-3-3|pg||
nt|othered1: Nicely j udged lead|pg||
pc|c7|nt|Walddk2: Nothing wrong with this slam|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: actually a good slam... need only to find @Hq|pg||
nt|joemanjo: xfer helped there, else spade lead wd immediately put trumps under pressure.|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes for sure|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|kaapo: Ok, some downgrading due to singleton J|pg||
nt|mmmakela: brb cig br|pg||
nt|kaapo: 2@D limits the hand further down?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: max 14-15 |pg||
nt|xenya: 10 tricks are available, yes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's around 50%, not bad at all|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: maybe even better with the 9 card fit|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ralfwil: now @d are 2-2, but if 3-1?|pg||
nt|varange: better slams are those that make :)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mmmakela: E knew 4-3 spades but didn't have a better option|pg||

nt|varange: too much relief|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a correct point of view, but not fair in all aspects:)|pg||
nt|varange: <-- being facetious|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That's 53%, singleton queen or 2-2, but ....|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: maybe north shd have started a cuebid with 3@S|pg||
nt|suketbombi: can survive DD tuff tho|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|vugraphzbf: to zadzwoñ do niego i powiedz :)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|vugraphzpx: 4@H showed a good raise to 4@S|pg||
nt|kaapo: Perhaps West could bid a minor suit to suggest a maximum with hearts?|pg||
nt|kaapo: 8 teams remain in the top division so there's lot to play for even for Örebridgen. They're currently 6th, 4.5 VPs ahead of the 8th positioned team|pg||
nt|kaapo: You'll find running scores via http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_plugins/content/content.php?content.877|pg||
pc|h9|nt|suketbombi: lead is not bad here and subhash has 2 entries to short Trump the dummy  but can get 2 Hearts and @D if correctly played|pg||
pc|hT|nt|frankaus: lots of good slams fails - and some bad ones make - i for 1 bid far to many  slams|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|varange: how would one know when one bids too many slams?|pg||
nt|joemanjo: That lead is good. Now 10 wll be difficult.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In the other room, West doubled 2@S and his poor partner is now in 2NT, mercifully undoubled|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: wow u have the %s at the tip of your fingers Roland|pg||
nt|vugraphzck: miskey - play out of turn - claiming at the end|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, I know when to bid my 12.89% slams|pg||
nt|suketbombi: he has not much options unless he thinks @HS are 4-4|pg||
nt|suketbombi: he has to try the @S finnesse first to know his target of @D tricks|pg||
nt|suketbombi: ?|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|chick: no one did, this hand is a nightmare in any contract|pg||
nt|col3435: (and 5VPs ahead of 9th)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|vugraphzbf: bo tylko siê Wacek denerwuje :)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: well clubs are 3-2 and the A right|pg||
pc|sA|nt|kaapo: I'm not very fond of West's 2@S but perhaps that was another small deception: he was trying to convince NS they should go to 4@H|pg||
nt|othered1: Probably depends on what north things their lead style would imply here.    To my eyes, 7 is an interesting card|pg||
nt|joemanjo: thgt spade wd come back|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mcphee: one entry short to make 6 I think|pg||
pc|s3|nt|burypies: jak siê k³óci to widaæ ¿e nie kuma to po co dzwoniæ|pg||
nt|kaapo: Interesting treatment. I've seen someone use 4@C and 4@D here as support bids, one promising @D cue, the other denying|pg||
pc|d2|pc|s4|pg||
pc|s6|nt|kaapo: He could squeeze East if nothing else works (double dummy) :)|pg||

pc|s7|nt|jkmjanusz: Ma trzy dojcia do sto³u - 11 lew powinno byc|pg||

pc|h5|nt|chick: if so, it certainly worked :)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: will be -2|pg||
nt|suketbombi: bridge made easy by subhash|pg||

pc|cK|nt|kaapo: High cross-ruff for the defence|pg||
nt|yuval10: E will need to cash A@h before last @c|pg||
pc|c3|nt|chick: yes, and with @Hs right for EW, this hand will go down only 1 or 2 :)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: now big problems|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: i would say he had big problems from the start... :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: W is worried about 6 @s's from N, perhaps?|pg||

nt|mcphee: what a dream lead for PO|pg||
nt|yuval10: now he won't even need that spectacular finish|pg||
pc|cA|nt|frankaus: smooth sailing fro here|pg||
nt|joemanjo: closed room result may be soon overtaken here. 4@s, 4@h, 1 club atleast.|pg||
pc|c7|nt|kaapo: 1@C was strong. Interesting to see that West didn't have any fancy convention but simply bid his best suit|pg||
nt|suketbombi: hi all|pg||
pc|c4|nt|chick: the @C7 just became a big card|pg||
nt|kaapo: I don't really see much better here than to hope for @CA at East|pg||
nt|kaapo: Well, perhaps @CA7 douleton|pg||
nt|kaapo: In theory, NS have 5 tricks before declarer has 9, but in practice they can't cash them|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||

pc|c3|nt|mmmakela: now must cash spades|pg||

pc|s8|pc|s9|nt|mmmakela: I'm betting on Higgins|pg||

nt|vugraphzpx: hmm i may have x-ray, but i see 9 tricks?|pg||
nt|yuval10: even after J@c has won :)|pg||
nt|kaapo: That had some potential for our first swing board|pg||
nt|kaapo:  15 was push: down one in both rooms|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think you can make 6@S even on a trump lead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but then again maybe 3@H was weak|pg||
nt|mdgraham: told 3@H=4@H with 0-6 hcp.|pg||
nt|othered1: I'm told: 3@H less than 6 pts-- then it was an underbid to my eyes|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 5@C by e-w makable here|pg||
nt|joemanjo: EW can reach a thin 4@h here.|pg||
mb|p|nt|arvid: 1@D is 4+ and always unbalanced|pg||

mb|1S|nt|kaapo: For EW in a contract declared ny East|pg||
nt|mmmakela: N must save|pg||
nt|frankaus: this will be a easy  hand for declarer with everything working|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Win the ace. Ruff one heart after giving up one and squeeze South in clubs and hearts|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: may get to 3 nt here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no singleton?|pg||
nt|othered1: do you repoen as easat?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|kaapo: Would you overcall 3@C?|pg||
nt|kaapo: Apparently 2@C is showing the majors|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: this one is nice 3N if they can bid it|pg||
nt|kaapo: Staffan does wisely and concentrates on the board actually being played. That's a good advice for any bridge player :)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: now tough for S|pg||
nt|frankaus: now the save|pg||
nt|kaapo: If NS are good guessers, they could make 4@S|pg||
nt|yuval10: 4@s looks like a fair-chance contract but both A@D offside and 4-1 trump will doom it|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: dbl or 2@C graham ?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, either could be right. 2@C has the advantage of bidding the good suit... |pg||
nt|suketbombi: 12-15 no major or 4-3-3-3 if there is a major|pg||
mb|p|nt|burypies: raz Witek siê pogubi³ na tej rozgrywce ale ogólnie naprawdê bardzo dobrze|pg||
nt|mmmakela: that was about today's snooker match|pg||
nt|mmmakela: S promising 10-12 NT|pg||
nt|mmmakela: will W balance?|pg||
nt|chick: I would|pg||
nt|arvid: I would|pg||
nt|kaapo: I guess I would too|pg||
nt|kaapo: Unapparently 4@C is asking to pick a major|pg||
nt|frankaus: pass  at 50s would be my action 2|pg||
nt|mmmakela: not the expected one|pg||
nt|kaapo: 10 down = 500|pg||
nt|frankaus: -10  = 500|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 4 H dbld cheaper|pg||
nt|frankaus: yes but hard to  be certain its not 800|pg||
nt|mmmakela: come on after 4 @C!|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, win @SA, then ruff a @H and eventually there is a squeeze against S|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 2 @C for me anyday|pg||
nt|suketbombi: a trf to @C if superaccepted even 4@S on a carefull handling will make|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: The web site (mostly in Swedish) is here somewhere: http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_plugins/content/content.php?content.877|pg||
nt|kaapo: @S to queen, then run 7|pg||
nt|othered1: would be nice if west can bid 2@D for longer suit|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 2@C is majors  2@D pick yours|pg||
nt|suketbombi: dont think kamal will move here|pg||
pc|sT|nt|chick: would you?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: after the pause is a club lead ethical?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: yes|pg||
nt|mcphee: lots down|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: no double no trouble :)|pg||
nt|kaapo: But just 50 each|pg||
nt|col3435: ok, I guess even on three rounds of diamonds declarer would probably go down there.|pg||
pc|s6|nt|kaapo: 2@D was some kind of Multi: showing a weak two bid in either major (or possibly some strong hand)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: they will land in 2@h now instead of 2@s, if S had opened with 1@s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: South has all the important cards. @CQJ and @HKQ|pg||
nt|othered1: Is south thinking of doing something?  Did north's original pass show some values?|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|jkmjanusz: Po przepuszczeniu @H Damy Kasprzak zmieni³ wista na @S !!|pg||
nt|kaapo: Apparently 2@H was a simple reverse, a little light but with nice 3-card support for partner and great controls|pg||
nt|kaapo: Diamond split is very cruel, in case they end up at some number of dimonds|pg||
nt|kaapo: What is the 1NT range here, Staffan?|pg||
nt|frankaus: 2@H will make so no real harm|pg||
nt|varange: the one is as good as the other?|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|chick: not necessarily a pause... remember the operator cannot enter bids until both people on one side of the screen have bid|pg||
nt|varange: friendly breaks either way|pg||
nt|yuval10: if he guess it that would be something :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but double shows the three-suiter and is possibly more flexible, and would therefore score 10/10 in a bidding competition|pg||
nt|mdgraham: board 5 - game missed at othert table as well|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 2nt knowing there is a minor fit|pg||
nt|suketbombi: y e-w play Demicoma 1nt denies 4 card major unless 4-3-3-3|pg||
nt|suketbombi: it is about a 50% game after pd gived you full 14|pg||
pc|h2|nt|kaapo: 14-16?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: not sure, 14-16 or 15-17|pg||
pc|h5|nt|abunio: raz tez Misiak umozliwil piekna rozgrywke, ale na pewno niebyl to blad prosty|pg||
nt|mmmakela: if Lebens this promises values(3@C)|pg||
nt|mcphee: they blew n/s out of 3N|pg||
nt|mmmakela: still wd EW|pg||
nt|varange: you'd open the south hand 1@s Frank?|pg||
nt|varange: or 1NT?|pg||
nt|frankaus: many here include 5M332 in their NT range - klinger has  a great influence here a he recomends it|pg||
nt|xenya: but this is very double dummy|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @C is only 5-card - d is best|pg||
nt|hawe45:  D|pg||
nt|othered1: "Knowing" may be a bit strong, if south could have 4=3=3=3 with 4-card major|pg||
nt|suketbombi: ok but they got 4 for there 200|pg||
pc|h8|nt|chick: that's one advantage of not bidding clubs, don't give away the bad distribution|pg||
nt|kaapo: Of course would be more cruel still, if South had them|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: they play lebensohl|pg||
nt|chick: if it promises clubs, that's ok with N|pg||
nt|mcphee: :)|pg||
nt|chick: but with a nice heart fit, it is trouble, double or not|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|arvid: If east had the jack of diamonds 6@D would have been a very good slam|pg||
nt|kaapo: Wrang saw short clubs with partner and opts for the 4-3 @S game|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: We had a lost connection at the other table which means board  15 isnt scored properly. The result in the open room was 6@S made, which should give another 14imps for Team Zang|pg||
nt|chick: he must win the @SA, so can ruff two clubs with the small trumps|pg||
nt|mmmakela: making 13|pg||
nt|yuval10: either way EW can make 10 tricks in @h because of the 87 doubleton @d so -1 in 4@s isn't so bad|pg||
nt|joemanjo: yes, missed the qj of clubs|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but with these suit discrepancies I would bid 2@C - always a good overcall of 1@D|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes that is rare N is known to take chances|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mmmakela: so then very nice auction|pg||
nt|frankaus: will be nervous about the @D situation|pg||
nt|varange: the 8@h is a big card|pg||
pc|c5|nt|varange: AQxxx isn't that flash anyway|pg||
nt|frankaus: yes  then i play garbage 2@C and puppet 3@C for all game going hands|pg||
nt|varange: ok|pg||
nt|varange: nice treatment|pg||
nt|col3435: can East just continue hearts here?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: yes he can|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: well he has only 3 carder @S and a very weak 4 card @H suit|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: easy on a @D lead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East will do very well to lead a spade here|pg||
nt|suketbombi: everyone is happy here|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mmmakela: well S never thinks with his 10-12.....|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: there are no screens |pg||
nt|mmmakela: against 2-way club most treat it as supposing the weak variation and W didn't bid after 1 @C so has clubs now if thinking one could assume|pg||
nt|mmmakela: even that was meant priv sry|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but, on the bidding, he may well do so - no, he has gone passive|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that's good - being happy is better than being miserable|pg||
nt|joemanjo: now @d|pg||
pc|c2|pg||

nt|sunsamvar: and my money is on him to pull off this contract|pg||
nt|vugraphzck: play out of turn...will claim at the end.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Play out of turn? We have heard that before. They can't keep doing that, surely|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: what a pity... great hand for timing in declarer play|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You lost the play?|pg||
nt|vugraphzck: yes...dummy played before his own turn|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: play 2 @C and then the 2nd @H|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: but east can take the @Ha and clear @H|pg||
nt|suketbombi: a @S ruff in Dummy will promote def trumps|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|joemanjo: Did Satya expect only 4 trumps with Kamal?|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|col3435: that would take some good guessing too :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: after the 2@d bid i think it's normal line|pg||

nt|mdgraham: cards lie well, should make|pg||

nt|suketbombi: yes|pg||
nt|othered1: Texam Aces now need less than one imp/board to take the lead.|pg||

nt|kaapo: Ever played Speedy Gonzales at some Swedish junior camp, Staffan?|pg||
nt|kaapo: Where will this end?|pg||
nt|joemanjo: I wonder where this will end. 3N or 5C? |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: multi 2@D|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 6@Hs on a @S guess played by Subhash if trumps 3-2 can try for @C Q 3 times before commiting to the @S guess not a bad slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: 3NT seems an interesting choice - I was thinking about 2NT or 4NT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, they won't get any here I fancy - this looks the flattest 4@S imaginable |pg||
nt|suketbombi: ashok is likely to pass this|pg||
nt|suketbombi: satya has no where to go and subhash must be not unhappy|pg||
mb|2H|nt|chick: E was about to bid spades, so now will he try his diamonds, or will he hide in the bushes and ambush a spade contract?|pg||
nt|chick: 2N obviously for the minors, not what N wanted to hear|pg||
nt|chick: and S violates rule  1 of preempts .... don't bid again unless forced.   But with 6-6, I can see the temptation|pg||
nt|kaapo: In the end, PO went one down and lost 12 IMPs|pg||

nt|ralfwil: perhaps best lead. declarer has to do all the work himself|pg||
nt|varange: yep|pg||
nt|varange: nice and neutral|pg||
nt|mdgraham: You have to bid 3@H, really.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: Lebensohl is a very good gimmick that can be used in many various situations|pg||
nt|mmmakela: really like this?|pg||
nt|kaapo: 2 down on a @C ruff|pg||
nt|frankaus: 5@D X will be a poor compensation for NS|pg||
nt|col3435: ah, the danger of bidding grands|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: yes, the players at the other table knew about the 6-2 in @d and bid 7. Bridge isnt fair... :)|pg||
nt|varange: dontcha hate it when underbids get the imps?|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: It's a nearly perfect fit NS, and neither one knows about the other's singleton|pg||
nt|varange: too true Staffan|pg||
nt|suketbombi: may get a @S lead and atrick wud be returned in @D|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: nice stab for n/s, just no tricks|pg||
nt|mcphee: maybe he can work some end play|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and how W has to attack trumps immediately|pg||
nt|suketbombi:  showed 4 Hearts and up to 10 hcp|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes the vital imp|pg||
nt|othered1: We're going through some relays and responses, it seems.|pg||
nt|suketbombi: there are various combitions available to Ashim this will take long for sure|pg||

pc|h5|nt|vugraphzbf: i kart nie pokazuj¹, które zagrywaj¹, chyba siê obra¿ê :)|pg||

nt|chick: it looks like a good hand, but still have to trust partner|pg||
nt|arvid: good lead|pg||
nt|mcphee: should try @D|pg||
nt|xenya: 3N is hopeless of course|pg||
nt|suketbombi: oh ace asking:)|pg||
pc|h9|nt|chick: then switch to a spade and start tapping declarer|pg||
nt|arvid: now this will be 4 or 5 down|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: I´ve played several speedys and I am used to winning speedys :)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|yuval10: either 4 or 1 @s.... looks like P not an option|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  to keep the loss as minimal as possible|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|varange: bye bye diamond loser|pg||
nt|othered1: I'm told: y, 1nt-8-13, 2H-4@H 8-10, 2nt no @S support|pg||
nt|suketbombi: next please|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 3 idiots led a @C there I guess and got caught in a @C @s sq to allow 7|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|kaapo: I agree with you there, Markku|pg||

nt|suketbombi: must be the only way to allow 7|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cT|pc|cK|pc|c2|pg||
nt|mmmakela: after S's 4 H N just can't dbl imho, must bid 5/6 H|pg||
pc|cA|nt|vugraphzpx: last time Ida Grönkvist picked me out for a speedy knowing i was the fastest one around... and we sure won at 67% too :)|pg||
nt|kaapo: The idea in a Speedy Gonzales bridge competition is that there's only a ridiculously short time per board to play|pg||
nt|arvid: sorry only 3, but much more difficult for east-west if south is declarer|pg||
nt|suketbombi: will concede 2 tricks ina hurry to make 5|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c7|pc|s2|pg||
nt|mcphee: this lets them show where they live as defenders|pg||
nt|yuval10: needed to play @d for -1, it seem|pg||

pc|s7|nt|mmmakela: time to cash 3 dias|pg||
nt|suketbombi: will test @S once break you have 8 tricks in bag strip squeeze the @@@C bidder  but not here|pg||
pc|s6|nt|mmmakela: imo S shd have 4 spades here if not strong enough to bid forward after pds 2 @S|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|varange: it'll make on the throw-in|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|xenya: N made a practical bid -- as many would i think|pg||
nt|suketbombi: tie here|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ralfwil: Couldn´t N see that he should be endplayed and won @d9 with @dA?|pg||
nt|kaapo: 5 IMPs for Skalman on board 17: 4@S without a double in the open|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 2 @Hs 2@DS and 2 @S to loose|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sA|nt|kaapo: Yes, was rather aggressive take out double|pg||
pc|s5|pg||

nt|chick: I'll bet it means, the info is here :)|pg||
nt|kaapo: Sylvan keeps getting a lot of diamonds|pg||
nt|mmmakela: I would bid 6|pg||
nt|frankaus: Aces and singleton a re great combination|pg||
nt|varange: 4@sE in the OR|pg||
nt|varange: and another interesting layout ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzck: players taking a break|pg||
nt|suketbombi: could be that vital imp to texan aces here|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes 2 smokers there|pg||
nt|othered1: another easy game, likely making 4 since there's no clear reason to guess trumps correctly|pg||
nt|othered1: And no reason to overbid, unless somehow @D are thought to provide tricks|pg||
nt|suketbombi: auction will be 1@H- 2@H  and W will settle for 4|pg||
nt|suketbombi: even if E gets agressive with a Nt will get a 2@D response and will bid 3@H but sighn off after the que bid from W|pg||
nt|vugraphzck: awaiting S at the table|pg||
nt|vugraphzck: resuming play|pg||
nt|suketbombi: no dhampur ahead |pg||
mb|1C|nt|joemanjo: hmm 1@c?|pg||
nt|xenya: note that 3!N has no play even if @Cs are 2-2|pg||
mb|p|nt|suketbombi: too too strong for the multi 2@D|pg||
nt|suketbombi: will rst in 4@H now|pg||
nt|suketbombi: rest|pg||
mb|1H|nt|kaapo: 1NT seems fine on the East cards|pg||
nt|chick: maybe he's a girl's best friend :)|pg||
nt|kaapo: 1@D is about 11-16 with 4+@D and suggests an unbalanced hand|pg||
nt|mcphee: 19 @S nice card for S hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: shall i ask him cornelia? :)|pg||
nt|kaapo: Surprising no pre-empt from N|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  so, @c and some strenght against @s and distribution |pg||
nt|suketbombi: the old trusted 3nt best here for N-S|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 6@D a great and a superior slam here|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: 3 good spades|pg||
nt|kaapo: East has an interesting opening bid choice|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes he decided to underbid this|pg||
mb|2H|an| |nt|col3435: on bd6, if East continued hearts, declarer would probably play another club with West showing out. Then west would be marked with all the cards in spades and diamonds, and it seems ...|pg||
nt|col3435: declarer could throw him in|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North has plenty to raise to 2@S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: when you six-card major is raised - bid game|pg||
mb|p|nt|burypies: lewy policzyl , ma wysiadywac nadróbkê?|pg||

nt|chick: 2N lebensohl again|pg||
nt|mmmakela: leb again|pg||
nt|chick: asking partner to bid 3@C|pg||
nt|kaapo: Or perhaps a transfer to clubs|pg||
nt|mcphee: 10@S I mean|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  EW reached their limit, what about NS?|pg||
nt|suketbombi: Jm has not finished:(|pg||
nt|othered1: but west has done more and east has a maximum, so|pg||
mb|2S|an| |nt|mmmakela: would you show majs or treat S hand as 1-suiter|pg||
nt|xenya: strange pass by S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: You can understand why South bids 3@D, even though imho it is an overbid |pg||
nt|suketbombi: ashim will stick? any way 4nt makes too|pg||
nt|suketbombi: will attack with @Ds knowing Thak|pg||
mb|p|nt|varange: can you explain Ralf?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: still, push-em-up|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ...onward and possibly upward.... |pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes K bendre is Kaustub Bendre and in Kibz bendre is his father|pg||
mb|3D|an| |nt|mmmakela: and direct 3 @C promising pos values|pg||
nt|chick: "transfer" implies that you have the suit.   in this case, it's more like a "relay" to clubs, with many possible hands|pg||
nt|kaapo: East had a very maximal hand and support for whatever suit West has and tries for game|pg||
nt|mmmakela: tries?|pg||
nt|kaapo: True, Cornelia, but many play real transfers in this position|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: East though seems unaware of that his partner has made a lebensohl bid |pg||
nt|kaapo: Your using keyboard input, Staffan?|pg||
nt|kaapo: *You're|pg||
nt|frankaus: nil vul is not so good to preempt|pg||
nt|kaapo: I didn't expect 2NT if EW play strong club, but I guess it's still an option|pg||
nt|mmmakela: grandmaproof 3 nt|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and West takes the bait|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  juicy 200?|pg||
nt|vugraphzck: S thinking hard|pg||
nt|suketbombi: in good time|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but seriously, East only bid 2@H |pg||
nt|suketbombi: safe to release ot this wud be 10 or even 1 tricks|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 11|pg||
nt|vugraphzck: N-E discussing|pg||
nt|suketbombi: e checking weather 3nt implied any @H support  N says Search Me:)|pg||
mb|d|nt|abunio: sorry, private|pg||
nt|burypies: w jakim kierunku zmierzaja?|pg||
nt|chick: majors|pg||
nt|kaapo: @S lead will bring the 8th trick|pg||
nt|kaapo: And if there are 8 there are 9, as the saying goes :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, it's teams, so not that important - as long as South is not tempted to bid 3@S|pg||
mb|3N|nt|jkmjanusz: A ³adsna? Warto dzwoniæ?|pg||
nt|chick: in competitive bidding, I think need to give as many options to partner as you can|pg||
nt|kaapo: 800 may have been very expensive, because EW's 4@S didn't seem easy at all|pg||
nt|kaapo: 1@C strong - 1@D weak|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: yes, but looking at the wrong hand as well... :)|pg||
nt|varange: says he, belatedly :)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  S could expect partner with relatively long @c and @h|pg||
nt|vugraphzck: oh ok|pg||
mb|p|nt|abunio: nie, do mojej mamy:)|pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: O, sorry...|pg||
nt|chick: if pard is not intereted, then can bid hearts|pg||
nt|frankaus: another friendly layout 4@D 2@C 1@H 2@S|pg||
nt|ralfwil: no! |pg||
nt|col3435: very much so :)|pg||
nt|col3435: nice though|pg||
nt|varange: yes|pg||
nt|xenya: double showed @Hs -- it would seem natural to bid your @S at that point|pg||
nt|othered1: Maybe the overcall will help west get trumps right|pg||
nt|othered1: for the requisite 1 imp per board|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: ok, but that's not lebensohl (for the benefit of kibs)|pg||
nt|kaapo: Yes, good to make the distinction clear|pg||
nt|mmmakela: not true Kaapo, most play leb here|pg||
nt|mcphee: this game may go down|pg||
nt|kaapo: As you see, D and S are adjacent on the keyboard. Easy to make "typos" if using keyboard input when operating :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: yeah, and all 13 cards are next to eachother so it´s easy to have a "clickos" for that :)|pg||
nt|mcphee: @C lead bad for the N hand|pg||
nt|kaapo: Well, you've been doing marvellously well :)|pg||
nt|varange: :) dang|pg||
nt|ralfwil: perhaps some kind of transfer|pg||
nt|varange: it seems that way|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: no alert on 1NT at least so I dont think they play it as transfer|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes and a singleton @D lead may confirm the trump position for OT|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: N likes the lead but...|pg||
nt|col3435: good prediction - spade lead didn't look clear to me|pg||
pc|d8|nt|chick: as long as EW cash their minor winners, this cannot make|pg||
nt|kaapo: Some might use Lebensohl here. If it's in use, then South's 3@D shows some values; he'd bid 2NT with a very weak hand|pg||
nt|varange: wow|pg||
pc|d9|nt|mmmakela: I hate playing in 4-2 when 6-1 was available(ok extreme case but 4-3 is probable)|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|pg||
nt|abunio: mama ladna, nie ma sprawy, tylko zajeta:)|pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: Mike Gold twierdzi, ¿e w Polsce dodaje sie 3BA do od¿ywek dzieciecych...|pg||
nt|kaapo: @DJ would suffer the same, too|pg||
pc|sT|nt|chick: often opponents will compete, taking partner off the hook|pg||
nt|mmmakela: so 1-suiter for me|pg||
nt|suketbombi: he is inducing Thak to cash his @H or underlead it:(|pg||
nt|suketbombi: @D can only be good for declerar here|pg||
pc|sA|nt|chick: and even if 4-2, opps cannot double (else you run to hearts)|pg||
nt|varange: then the DBL must have some unknown meaning|pg||
nt|varange: how would S interpret the 3@d|pg||
nt|suketbombi: sure imp for texans|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|pg||
nt|arvid: even if south is showing some values with 3@D I think his hand is too good|pg||
nt|col3435: yeah, and club is worse!|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|chick: and to paraphrase your comment:   I hate playing in a 6-1 when 4-4 was available :)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: any opinions from kibs? majors or 1-suiter?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  small club from table?|pg||
nt|suketbombi: oops what was that play of @Sa?|pg||
pc|d5|nt|kaapo: Most do, but many don't :)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 9 and next, cant take the spade hook|pg||
nt|varange: any spec who knows?|pg||

pc|d4|nt|abunio: postanowili dac szanse kibicom na emocje do konca|pg||
nt|varange: theree's my answer|pg||
nt|suketbombi: he gets his 9th trick |pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|kaapo: @H10 isn't that great either|pg||
pc|s9|nt|kaapo: Nystöm could give a ruff but he would then lose his natural @C trick|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: yeah, but that would force south to ruff a club |pg||
nt|kaapo: Seems to end +1 either way|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: true|pg||
nt|xenya: friendly lead -- 10 tricks are available now|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mmmakela: name 1 besides you|pg||
nt|kaapo: My partner, I hope ;)|pg||

pc|sJ|nt|kaapo: And Garozzo, perhaps|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|abunio: 36 boards, 3 segments, 12 boards each|pg||
nt|mmmakela: and more to the point I think S shd bid 3 H instead of 4 @S in this sequence to show his hand|pg||
nt|mcphee: nice D from west|pg||

nt|abunio: tak, bezpieczny przedzial to 13-14|pg||
mb|2N|nt|chick: there is a club slam, if declarer can catch the K|pg||
nt|kaapo: I suppose the style is that with 13-14 it's always without a 4-card major|pg||
nt|mmmakela: I agree with 1 H|pg||
nt|kaapo: Yes, nice overcall|pg||
nt|kaapo: 1@D shows 4+@H|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ok, just wondered :)|pg||
nt|suketbombi: nice guy plays with Mike Lawarence often in USA|pg||
nt|suketbombi: satya does not have confortable rebid may setle for 2nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|abunio: interesujaca kontra, wlasciwie zrozumiana|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 3 nt promising shortness I suppose|pg||

nt|kaapo: And meanwhile, the match is almost even. Zang lost some expected IMPs on 17 and 19|pg||
nt|kaapo: 1@C was either 11-13 NT or 17+|pg||
nt|mmmakela: wet pass from S|pg||
nt|suketbombi: easy 3nt for sumit|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: or asking cues up the line|pg||
nt|varange: gotta bid that spade suit some time|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  does 2NT mean fit? at least invitational?|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: but now he has nothing else to do, no cuebid, etc|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: N-S plays 14-16NT|pg||
nt|kaapo: 1@H 8+ with 4+@H (could have longer minor)|pg||
nt|varange: ah. well.|pg||
nt|col3435: heh, I didn't think of pass :)|pg||
nt|varange: there's that|pg||
nt|col3435: you'd bid 4@s then?|pg||
nt|joemanjo: North decides to pass without a fight this time.|pg||
mb|p|nt|kamyk: a Wejknis ma do wygrania 4@S:)|pg||
nt|suketbombi: @H lead from Subhash|pg||
pc|h9|nt|kaapo: 2@C either balanced or clubs, and 17+|pg||
nt|kaapo: Hmm... 2@D might show extras|pg||
nt|kaapo: At least that was how I played it|pg||
nt|kaapo: I guess he could try something|pg||
nt|kaapo: And 1@C could be 2 cards, either natural unbalanced, or balanced|pg||
nt|col3435: I'd rather West bid 3@d the first time|pg||
nt|suketbombi: from Dalas Aces to Texan Aces:)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mmmakela: ok sound contract, 5 can be in jeopardy|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|kaapo: I see, tack Staffan|pg||
nt|kaapo: 2NT apparently shows a balanced hand, and now 4@C looks like a control bid with @H support|pg||
nt|suketbombi: he has a chance tho but unlikely since if he concedes @Cs will loose 3 @Hs a @c and a@S|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|varange: here's the knr hand evaluator for the East hand|pg||
nt|varange: http://www.jeffgoldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=AQ9xx+Kxx+AKx+Kx|pg||
nt|varange: 19.85 HCP|pg||
nt|othered1: East can get @D ruff, if they're really careful|pg||
nt|suketbombi: oh?|pg||
nt|suketbombi: followed by @SJ and dec has some work will eventualy make this|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|kaapo: I'd bid 3, also|pg||
pc|s3|nt|varange: yes, provided the X promised spades|pg||
nt|varange: how many will declarer be off?|pg||
nt|varange: 3?|pg||
pc|s6|nt|kaapo: Yes, lots of working finesses too|pg||
nt|kaapo: If @Hs are 4-1, you might still make 6NT while 6@H fails|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|mdgraham: he has to get the ruff with a low trump|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so South has to lead @SQ (no entry to dummy) and West has to duck it - very difficult |pg||
nt|suketbombi: @SJ has to be ducked by JM|pg||
nt|othered1: But possible, as play of interion @S would be very tricky from AQJ|pg||
nt|othered1: interior|pg||
nt|vugraphzck: S thinking.....|pg||
nt|suketbombi: :) you need to know your customer|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c6|nt|mmmakela: perfect for action dbl/2 NT choose the minor|pg||
pc|c2|nt|chick: If 2N is Jacoby, 3N shows 14-15.  |pg||
nt|mmmakela: 10 and next|pg||
nt|kaapo: It seems South is just relaying here|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|suketbombi: easy now|pg||
pc|dK|nt|kaapo: 5@H likely normal RKCB response, two key cards without the queen of hearts|pg||
nt|mcphee: yes, but I think they will play @H|pg||
nt|suketbombi: not tested|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mmmakela: needed a H lead and cashout|pg||
nt|chick: needed a heart back, now S can pitch the 2nd heart|pg||
nt|mmmakela: was too late|pg||
nt|kaapo: South had no fast entry to dummy?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: it was too late when east returned a club. East could return a diamond since South has no direct entry to dummy for a club finesse|pg||
pc|d8|nt|burypies: po kierowym tak|pg||
nt|kaapo: And North has likely described his full shape by now|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: North has shown 4315, 8-9p|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|kaapo: And strength within one point range (likely restricted due to not opening the bidding)|pg||
nt|kaapo: Ed Schapiro prefers 5@C to 3NT|pg||
nt|suketbombi: well played sumit|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d7|pc|dA|nt|kaapo: North did have an unexpected high singleton|pg||
nt|suketbombi: if he concedes @C will get a @S back Misguess and a @D back still chance for def|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|frankaus: 2@S or 3@D would have had EW licking their lips|pg||
nt|joemanjo: back|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dJ|pc|s2|pc|d2|pg||

pc|d9|nt|mmmakela: either action will find 3 clubs|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Why not a @h instead of @d? declarer played like he held a 3-card @h|pg||
pc|h2|nt|varange: Orebrodge are winning by 17/2 this session|pg||
nt|col3435: definitely headed that way|pg||
nt|varange: he'll make his ace, and that is that|pg||
nt|kaapo: Both majors behave, so he'll just lose a club|pg||
pc|h7|nt|yuval10: yep, 12 tricks|pg||
nt|joemanjo: To those who asked, "3 Idiots" is a new movie released in India.|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|c4|nt|suketbombi: N has a promotable trump + @CQ and a @D trick not after @@S return|pg||

mb|p|nt|kaapo: She|pg||
nt|yuval10: 4NT now?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: 5@S perhaps?|pg||
nt|yuval10: follows by 6@c over 5@d |pg||
nt|yuval10: quite hard|pg||
nt|joemanjo: 3N or 4@S?|pg||
mb|2D|nt|kaapo: Many would open the South hand nowadays. Surprising to see a strong clubber pass it|pg||
nt|frankaus: not many would pass|pg||
nt|col3435: I thought it was because he didn't feel the hand was good enough with a misfit, but evidently it was more because he wanted the penalty|pg||
nt|vasanti: does 4 hcp warrant a bid?|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: 1@C was either balanced or natural|pg||
nt|othered1: @D split makes 4@S a potential problem|pg||
nt|mdgraham: could this be 6@S in one room and 2@S in the other.....|pg||
mb|2H|nt|kaapo: 2@D looks like natural, nonforcing call|pg||
nt|kaapo: And 3@H likely a fit jump|pg||
nt|ralfwil: nice score in OR!|pg||
nt|varange: hmm|pg||
nt|vasanti: in desperation yes they are at the moment not|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: no, but later you might have to guess whether partner has a 3-card support for @Ss|pg||

nt|kaapo: This appears to have about 6 losers|pg||
nt|mmmakela: pd opened in fav zone 10 points....|pg||
nt|kaapo: Wow, a natural system played in Swedish premmier league!|pg||
nt|yuval10: pass, if forcing, is very good by S|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: they seem to have stopped at a makeable spot|pg||
nt|varange: i'm just trying to figure out how it made!|pg||
nt|ralfwil: easy -1 here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: or -2|pg||
nt|varange: small club led|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: easy down 2 i would say|pg||
nt|col3435: I'd have just bid 4@h I think, can slam be that good?|pg||
nt|col3435: don't see how North can bid it|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  :-)|pg||
nt|othered1: I'd guess that in CR the NS *Know* they have a bad result . . .|pg||
nt|mdgraham: superficially, yes :) but one result is worse than the other, depending on your point of view  |pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  what is the probability of finding all 13 cards?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not sure|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|col3435: well, like that, evidently :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: after Pass by S i think she MUST bid it|pg||
nt|kaapo: By eptying the box save 7@S and 7NT|pg||
nt|col3435: if pass is forcing|pg||
nt|yuval10: the play will be interesting...... she might know that W has only 3 @s's from the bid|pg||
nt|yuval10: she can ruff 2 @d's..... and see that E has 3|pg||
nt|kaapo: Has West still something to think about?|pg||
nt|yuval10: then 8-1-3-1|pg||
nt|suketbombi:  ok the result wud be the same  460|pg||
nt|suketbombi: the other semis lot of Puneiets have been asking as there latest Hero kaustub bendre is batlling out against MMS|pg||
pc|sK|nt|chick: its not impossible that S will switch to spades, hoping to remove the entry to diamonds|pg||
nt|kaapo: North seems to have a chance for 10 tricks, if he raises the heart suit first|pg||
nt|yuval10: i belive she'll make it|pg||
nt|yuval10: sry HE will make it|pg||
nt|yuval10: because S is declarer|pg||
nt|kaapo: Cilla might make a comment about him never presenting a good dummy, and her showing an example :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: i think S will like the dummy he'll see :)  he knows it's a reasonable grand, now only have to make!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I think he will|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Would Haglund bid 6@S with @CQx?|pg||
nt|suketbombi: here too they wud think 10 imps gone|pg||
pc|s8|nt|burypies: czasami nawet Witek ma piki|pg||
nt|kaapo: Apparently their 2NT opening was something like 22-24|pg||
nt|mmmakela: -1|pg||
nt|kaapo: So 2@C followed by 2NT would be say 20-21|pg||
nt|varange: agreed|pg||
nt|suketbombi: sridhar your Favoraite pd Sudhir Inamdar has come out of retirement and playing in other room|pg||
nt|suketbombi: he will lead 2 rather than unconfortable 8|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Must have a lot of shape for that|pg||
nt|yuval10: lead @d will make it easier for him |pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|nt|kaapo: This seems to lose 2 spades, @D and @C|pg||
nt|kaapo: After North's fine spade switch|pg||
pc|dT|nt|chick: this works to kill the diamonds, but let's W have 2 diamond tricks|pg||
nt|mmmakela: now 8|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: might endplay North|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|c6|nt|xenya: lucky layout for EW|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 2 bds i Imp subhash must be aware the match is close specialy after the 6@H went dn here|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mdgraham: looks like 4@c was an auto-splinter (a splinter agreeing my suit), but the values outside are quite soft|pg||
nt|mdgraham: incidentally, that last board - why did East play a club back after the @SA?|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c2|pg||
nt|mmmakela: yes although obvious many wouldn't make it|pg||
pc|d4|nt|kaapo: Still more IMPs for Skalman on boards 19 (stopped at 3@S) and 20 (3NT went down)|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dA|nt|mmmakela: next a club and then N must find H switch|pg||
nt|kaapo: Interesting lead holding AK|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|abunio: jakos sie przeczolgal|pg||
nt|vugraphzbf: imp straty?|pg||
nt|varange: there is no justice!|pg||
nt|joemanjo: Cards lie so that the @h lead, though it attacked the weak spot, does not cause substantial dent to EW hands.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|yuval10: @h to T, A@d and @d ruff|pg||
nt|kaapo: So it's very important for Örebridgen that Mikael makes this, which does seem quite likely|pg||

nt|mmmakela: as will these gentlemen if given chance|pg||
nt|kaapo: Lower still, here|pg||
mb|3N|nt|burypies: a teraz co bêdzie ? Witek 10 ma|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Running a little late in this room as the next match is scheduled to start half past the hour|pg||
nt|mmmakela: oldfashioned nt dbl|pg||
nt|kaapo: AKQx makes for a perfect overcall suit|pg||
nt|vugraphzck: board inverted. player names will differ|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: 5@D certainly looks like a good contract, but will likely fail with the spade finesse off|pg||
nt|Walddk4: That won't happen|pg||
nt|ralfwil: "who says that crime doesn´t pay" from Bridge in the menagery (about Hidgeous Hog)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|kaapo: I'd have guessed North would open 1NT. Perhaps they play 15-17 1NT in third and fourth seat|pg||
nt|chick: and a non-transfer runout|pg||
nt|joemanjo: when in doubt ...|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzpx: they play 14-16NT. Dont know why Olof didnt go for 1NT|pg||
nt|kaapo: Fredin - Lindkvist also missed the slam on board 7, playing at the 5 level...|pg||
nt|kaapo: However it was doubled, with an overtrick|pg||
nt|kaapo: Which was worth 11 IMPs, as you can see in the movie|pg||
nt|kaapo: You can find Running Scores via a link here: http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_plugins/content/content.php?content.877|pg||
nt|othered1: lucky hardly describes it|pg||
nt|suketbombi: ok they will surely make this probably with an ot|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: S's dbl???|pg||
nt|kaapo: I suppose most are old-fashioned with doubles facing a weak NT (if it was one) :)|pg||
nt|chick: balance of points double maybe|pg||
nt|mmmakela: too risky in my book|pg||
nt|suketbombi: trump lead by Subhash:(|pg||
mb|p|nt|kamyk: rednia impa na rozdanie jest imponuj¹ca|pg||
nt|varange: http://www.jeffgoldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=5+Q+KQ873+AKQ632 |pg||
nt|varange: lose three aces|pg||
nt|xenya: this won't be a success|pg||
nt|othered1: that's certainly a good start for declarer, if he guesses @S correctly|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 3nt better you can suffer a @H ruff in @Ss|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h8|nt|burypies: ale sobie poradzi³|pg||
nt|varange: 20HCP|pg||
nt|col3435: could be +1 ...|pg||
pc|hA|nt|joemanjo: the 'wish I were taking my nap" hands.|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|suketbombi: diffcult to cash here may play in for @C K and @S J  to beat and restrict in process|pg||
pc|cA|nt|kaapo: You can access the movie by clicking the green MOVIE button bottom-right of the screen|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Exactly the same auction so far but then Åsmo chickened out|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I think Ejnell could do better with that good @c support|pg||
nt|othered1: There's a purpose to the !Q play, but here it's possible declarer was going wrong|pg||
pc|c7|nt|rnc: Next match on vugraph (round 10) starts at 21.00: BK Lavec "Smile" (with Peter Fredin-Magnus Lindkvist) vs Näsby BS |pg||
nt|kaapo: Gärds - Malmström found a slam that didn't make|pg||
nt|kaapo: They chose 6@C and lost 17 IMPs|pg||
nt|varange: excitement then, after all|pg||
pc|c3|nt|kaapo: We are on two last boards of the set and have comparisons from the open room|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|kaapo: Tack Carl :)|pg||
nt|varange: kinda difficult to avoid slam with that hand opposite a partner who opens the bidding|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c4|nt|mmmakela: small club immidiately?|pg||
nt|chick: I don't know about 'chose' ... E made a psyche overcall in hearts|pg||
nt|kaapo: Fredin - Lindkvist back together?|pg||
nt|col3435: nope, well cashed, pity it's not MPs|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mmmakela: no|pg||
nt|chick: the other room has 5 boards yet to play, so score is not yet a good indicator|pg||
nt|mmmakela: so a push thx to the dbl|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: W 34.tym graja 4@H. Trzy Kara sa przy dubli @H...|pg||
pc|h3|nt|xenya: 3N by N feels like an overbid|pg||
pc|h9|nt|Walddk4: For the occasion, yes|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1@H was not a psyche|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It showed a bad overcall in one major|pg||
nt|Walddk4: And bad it was|pg||
nt|kaapo: Or by clicking My Results on the right, if using the browser-enabled Flash BBO|pg||
pc|h6|nt|kaapo: Nice to have honest opponents like that :)|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Walddk4: The fact that Ejnell did not cue bid spades should have been encouraging for East I think. Then his high cards must be in the right places|pg||
nt|joemanjo: cant be the Ace. |pg||
nt|suketbombi: ok last bd comming up:)|pg||

nt|Walddk4: How can that be a psyche over a strong club?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: He had what he promised|pg||
nt|Walddk4: One major, bad cards|pg||
nt|kaapo: Thanks a lot to Staffan Hed, our splendid operator!|pg||
nt|kaapo: Trust me, it's rather tiring operating the vugraph whole day|pg||
nt|chick: Staffan has been such an outstanding operator today!  Can't say enough good about him :)|pg||

nt|vasanti: partial hand again does not give much chance to swing|pg||
nt|suketbombi: does not matter namdev too will make ten tricks here|pg||
nt|joemanjo: 4@h anyone?|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 63 63:):):):)|pg||
nt|suketbombi: oh they have missed a game there:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: Tack så mycket Staffan Hed, bra jobbat!|pg||
nt|kaapo: A great thank you for our marvellous operator, Staffan Hed, who had to wake up ridiculously early this morning to bring this show to us!|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 1nt any one?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|kaapo: I don't object to that but I think it would be fair to state that 1NT is usually not 14 in 3rd hand then|pg||
nt|mmmakela: last here, thx kibs,Kaapo, Chick and Staffan for outstanding operator job!|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: thank you, will try to keep myself from commentating though :)|pg||
nt|kaapo: 1@C 2+@C, natural or balanced|pg||
nt|yuval10: NS can find a good sacrifice in a major|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: not that early, about 7.50am.. :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: only -4|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  with a little bit more @c lay, 5@c could have been better than 7-trumps @s game|pg||
nt|vasanti: 4hrt sld be on if they do find it agst boss suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: hard to match the OR result here|pg||
nt|kaapo: 1@C 2-way|pg||
nt|kaapo: More tiring than actual playing, because you need to keep focused all the time|pg||
nt|kaapo: "Early bird opens the can of worms" or how does the saying go?|pg||
nt|col3435: hehe, almost|pg||
mb|3N|nt|kaapo: 2@D looks like natural and game forcing|pg||
nt|kaapo: Um, sorry, 1@C may have been strong for EW :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: 1@D either 11-13 NT or unbalanced with a 4-card major; does not promise dimonds|pg||
nt|kaapo: And thanks Cornelia, Bob and Roland + kibs|pg||
nt|col3435: looks hard to avoid this one|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  anyway - game was poor|pg||
nt|vasanti: seems to be some systematic fit+club|pg||
nt|suketbombi: even intra finese working does not help 4@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzck: 3 more to go|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  not so this one|pg||
pc|h9|nt|jkmjanusz: 7IMP - ale raczej p³asciochy...|pg||
nt|burypies: nawet Wacek mo¿e mieæ problem|pg||
nt|mmmakela: needs the @S A lead to make 6|pg||
nt|kaapo: Would anyone try 3@C as North?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|kaapo: Hmm, have they incorporated transfers into the system?|pg||
nt|kaapo: 2@S might show something like 8-12 here|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: 10-13|pg||
nt|vasanti:  anybody 4 4sp?|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|Walddk4: If he had a long minor instead of a major, it would be a psyche, but 1@H surely was not|pg||
nt|kaapo: That seems to be a raising trend in Sweden|pg||
nt|chick: no dummy-time naps :)|pg||
nt|col3435: club lead?|pg||
nt|suketbombi: subhash does not like to rebid weak suits ahead of his 6 card @S|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|kaapo: Very standard bidding here|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: except for when sundelin is on... then you get a nap or two... :)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mmmakela: so last board now thx all for watching!|pg||
nt|chick: hehehe|pg||
pc|dT|nt|kaapo: Oh, I see. Glad you're there to correct us Staffan :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: should go one down |pg||
nt|joemanjo: in practise, almost impossible to get to @h contract|pg||
pc|d2|nt|vugraphzck: announcement at the venue|pg||
nt|vugraphzck: Dr. Sudhir Bapat has expired about half an hour back at the table|pg||
nt|vugraphzck: condolence meeting being held|pg||

nt|suketbombi:  2- here w/o @SQ lead|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hK|nt|kaapo: Det är sant det :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: thanks all|pg||
pc|h6|nt|kaapo: Perhaps there's case for playing 5@C here too? Or 4@H|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: A, nie: zagrali vtylko 3@H|pg||
nt|abunio: chyba, ze drugi stol co postawi z paleczka|pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: Nie dograli popartyjnej koñcówki...|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: After this it will be dinner break and the play will continue at 1915, maybe 1920|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes but they will loose 6/8 imps on this bd|pg||
pc|d4|nt|kaapo: Tied with 1st place now!|pg||
nt|kaapo: Tack!|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|Walddk4: wow, they stayed out of the laydown grand slam|pg||
nt|joemanjo: club Jack|pg||
pc|d5|nt|arvid: well done by Bergström to bid on 3NT|pg||
nt|col3435: I'm sure there are some who would give it away on the lead|pg||
nt|suketbombi: ok another push now 24 in 2|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|abunio: Witus byl bezkompromisowy, a tam chyba dwukolorowka nie zagrala|pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: Tak: 2@C (dwukolor.) - 3@H invit...|pg||
nt|varange: that heart lead wasn't at all obvious|pg||
nt|suketbombi: :)|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 3 Iidiots and the unsung +1 are in finals now:) |pg||
pc|h2|nt|chick: if he had bid 6, the @SA is a possible lead, but not at 4|pg||
nt|chick: Thanks to our excellent vugraph operator, Staffan Hed!|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: Thank you all for watching and commentating :)|pg||
nt|chick: and thanks to my co-commentator, Markku Makela!    We'll be back soon with the next segment :)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: thx Cornelia|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Anyway, well bid small slam by N-S next door|pg||
pc|h4|nt|suketbombi: life ban gaya|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|c2|pg||
nt|kaapo: Here we saw the 3rd/5th lead versus notrumps|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cA|nt|xenya: looks like NS can make 8 tricks in spades... -- perhaps on a different lead|pg||
mc|10|nt|chick: should make this easily, even with the @HQ off|pg||
nt|kaapo: NS lack some aces to bring this home|pg||
nt|joemanjo: what?|pg||
nt|vugraphzck: missed play - claiming at the end|pg||
nt|joemanjo: certainly looked like that|pg||
nt|suketbombi: misplay or misclick?|pg||
nt|joemanjo: miskey|pg||
nt|vugraphzck: speed play....missed a trick|pg||
nt|vugraphzck: finals coming up soon|pg||
