mb|1C|nt|davidstern: Pretty good 5@C contract depending on diamond finesse|pg||

nt|chick: anyone for overcalling with E hand?|pg||

mb|1S|nt|rodal f: Hard to defend 3NT S. Only a @C lead makes it down|pg||

mb|p|nt|phil_20686:  you have any preferences for norths bidding here tony?|pg||
mb|2N|nt|mdgraham: the fact that the diamond finesse is offside for NS means that it is onside for EW|pg||

mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|rodal f: A very good lead|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s6|nt|davidstern: I believe that this will be one level too high|pg||

nt|jackthelad: N just likes to bid|pg||
nt|ppiglett: I bid spades partner!|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|davidstern: East better make sure he doesnt get endplayed - unlikely of course|pg||
nt|davidstern: E/W probably feel a little sick at this point - could have passed out 4@H and now being forced to defend 4|pg||
nt|chick: do you think E is leading this K because he thinks his pard has the suit?   surely he can't want a ruff with that trump holding|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, it happens. I once protected against 1@D in the pass-out seat and ended up conceding 1370 in 6@C|pg||
nt|chick: so annoying |pg||
nt|barbyh: now thats bad luck|pg||
nt|davidstern: If he believes the @HA is with South he can split honours, win next heart get partner in and get his ruff so not THAT unusual|pg||

pc|h6|nt|davidstern: And there will be an endplay if that happened|pg||
pc|hT|nt|phil_20686:  yeah, but there are 3 hand types here that affect the preferences, 6-4, 5-5 5-4, i suspect that most experts would use the 2nt bid to show whatever of these they deem most important, as a natural meaning seems superflous|pg||
pc|h5|pc|d6|pg||
pc|c6|nt|davidstern: Also with 7 spades thought it possible partner may have a singleton spade|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes|pg||

nt|eamongall: so lets see his effort |pg||
nt|phil_20686:  the problem for the defence is that they cannot lead their partners suit enough times so declarer will never have a problem scoring (eventually) 3c 4h 1s 1d|pg||
