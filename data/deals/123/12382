mb|p|nt|athene: 1@D = spades, 1@H = hearts here i guess|pg||
nt|beauch:  1d - showed 4 plus hearts i presume|pg||
nt|athene: i mean as opening bids|pg||
nt|3for3: MOSCITO stands for major oriented strong club, with transfer openings...or something like that|pg||
mb|2D|an|alerted|mb|p|nt|athene: yes major-oriented strong club incorporating transfer openers|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|athene: or "in trouble often" i think the last three letters were sometimes :)|pg||
nt|3for3: incorporating...that is where the I comes from :)|pg||

nt|Walddk2: http://www.bridgeguys.com/Conventions/MoscitoSystem.html|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: W in the tank|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: there are many versions of moscito but the basis is always limited 4-card major openers|pg||
pc|cT|nt|athene: i don't know any versions that use canap√© in the majors so i am still going for 1@D showing spades, and after that they are happily into an incomprehensible relay auction|pg||

nt|3for3: Yes, we here in the ACBL are not so permissive|pg||

pc|h5|pc|hQ|pc|h7|pc|h3|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|2C|an|alerted|nt|Walddk2: East's hand is known as a Yarborough|pg||
