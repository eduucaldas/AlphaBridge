nt|sharkey: Gd morning|pg||
nt|sybarra: gm Carl  welcome |pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: It seems we'll have to restart the broadcast in order to correct the score. We apologize for the inconvenience|pg||
nt|Walddk8: score incorrect, pls shut down|pg||
nt|sybarra: we had an exciting last set  W.H  took the lead |pg||
mb|1N!|mb|3D|nt|andersk: Looks like we have 14 board to come here!|pg||
nt|burry1975: final this year as expected between the White house and 't Onstein|pg||
nt|sybarra: better! |pg||
nt|rnmalik: I was a kib some fantastic play:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: re score |pg||
mb|p|nt|burry1975: the two semi professional teams in the Netherlands|pg||
nt|sybarra: toughest 4 players perhaps in the other room |pg||
nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: n/s play Tarzan club |pg||
nt|sybarra: assuming we have same pair |pg||
pc|c2|nt|andersk: When I saw the line up, I kinda digured that this is "the match" of the championship|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello Vladimir and welcome again|pg||
pc|cA|nt|burry1975: at this table Brink - Drijver who play together for a number of years now and had a lot of good results since|pg||
nt|andersk: that was a great lead from East|pg||
nt|burry1975: jansma paulissen only play together for two years now. This year they won the butler in the RR i believe|pg||
nt|andersk: Probably only lead to set this contract|pg||
nt|burry1975: i think they were both members of the junior team that won the world championships in 87|pg||
nt|andersk: looks like MUD lead for me|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Yes excellent lead, attacks declarer's entries while the diamonds are blocked|pg||
nt|andersk: MUD is Medium Up Down, this is to show partner that lead was from weak 3 card suit|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  On any other lead, declarer can concede a diamond and reach the good diamonds with the @sA|pg||
nt|andersk: next card will be @S 9 then @S 3|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: Drijver just asked about the leads. Paulissen explained 2nd 4th from any holding, but from eg KJT(xx) the J. "Very old-fashioned"|pg||
pc|c7|nt|rnmalik: delayed this segment by 45 minutes|pg||
nt|sybarra: Brink/Drijver v Jansma/Paulssen      |pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|sharkey: assume 1 NT = 12-14?|pg||
pc|d6|nt|andersk: maybe thay will start plying MUD now|pg||
nt|andersk: :9|pg||
nt|sybarra: but our guys are no slouches!|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dJ|nt|rnmalik: tough contract would need some play|pg||
nt|sybarra: *Paulissen.....sorry |pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Hi everyone|pg||
nt|sharynr: good day all :)|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes think that range, it is a club system  |pg||
pc|dA|nt|Vugraphzbt: EW play upside-down count and attitude|pg||
pc|c8|pc|d9|pc|dT|pg||
nt|andersk: When you see the layout here! Normally they win 1 NT, defenders "almost never" finds the holding in every suit|pg||
pc|dK|pc|c5|nt|burry1975: with hearts 3 3 this can make now if declarer guesses right|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Walddk1: Welcome to Jean Harings|pg||
nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|d8|nt|sybarra: named Tarzan Club as result of their names....wijs/muller sounding much like the name of the guy (Weismuller) who starred in the old Tarzan movies|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: Hi Jean :)|pg||
nt|jeanhari: hi.. way away for a minute, cooking dinner|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Jean |pg||
nt|rnmalik: Welcome|pg||
nt|jeanhari: I think the players persuaded Hans to play 2 sets each the first day|pg||
nt|sybarra: do tell us what is for dinner?|pg||
pc|h6|nt|andersk: well played|pg||
nt|burry1975: yes probably the best line and still leaves option open to run the diamonds|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  The defenders winning the first diamond means they probably are not breaking|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I think he will still need to guess clubs to make|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: Brink just remarked they've been playing the first board for 12 minutes now|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sharkey: you go back a few years Shirley :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: 11 tricks - no more no less here|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|d4|pc|cT|pc|c6|nt|nigel_k:  There looks to be two trump losers but an endplay may be possible|pg||
nt|xenya: endplay? i don't think so|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  It's an entry short - after discarding a spade on the fourth club and ruffing a spade is in the wrong hand|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  If he was then able to lead the last club from North and ruff it he would make the last two tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: true|pg||
nt|vugraphzbt: dbl on 1nt and 2@d were alerted|pg||
nt|sharynr: looks like a good start for E-W|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|sybarra: I watched the old movies on TV |pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|pc|hT|pc|hA|pg||
pc|h3|nt|sharynr: they will make 3 or 4 depending on defence|pg||

nt|jeanhari: spaghetti Tetrazzini by Jamie Oliver|pg||
nt|jeanhari: but to the bridge now...|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello all and welcome|pg||
nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|xenya: is this score right? it was different a few minutes ago i think |pg||
nt|xenya: match score i mean|pg||
nt|xenya: hi Rashed|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Natalia is the match score correct please|pg||
nt|xenya: was 157 for Onstein i'm told|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharynr: the diamond suit seems to have shifted|pg||
mb|1D!|mb|2S|nt|burry1975: ew can make 5 spades, NS can bid up to 5D which is only down 1|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|andersk: No entrances in East, so 10 tricks in @H for NS, and 11 EW in @S|pg||
nt|xenya: just catching up |pg||
mb|3D|nt|jeanhari: I think indeed the level of play wasn"t that good in the second set|pg||
nt|xenya: another hand to play in partscore rather than game|pg||
mb|p|nt|burry1975: 2d probably a non minimum heart raise|pg||
nt|andersk: The question is if Jansma will let them play 5@D, probably since he hold 3 small @H and alot too defense with|pg||
nt|jeanhari: some questionable defense and declarerplay|pg||
nt|sybarra: we have seen better |pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: or 172 -- anyway way bigger|pg||
nt|henryb: well and quickly played|pg||
mb|p|nt|andersk: wow|pg||
nt|burry1975: the double fit made it 'easy' for paulissen|pg||
nt|andersk: If 2 @D is a @H raise, I cant see how Jansma can get away from 6@S|pg||
nt|burry1975: 6d would put some pressure on it. and costs only 2 imps, will brink do it?|pg||
nt|sharynr: south should try 3NT|pg||
nt|sharynr: imp|pg||
nt|sharynr: imo|pg||
pc|h7|nt|jeanhari: proves how difficult the game is|pg||
pc|h3|nt|burry1975: dbl here shows I want to bid 6D|pg||
nt|andersk: we are 26 mintes in the set, they have played 1 NT = and now bidding board 2, this will be a long day :)|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I thought I had done well to avoid Muller's table |pg||
nt|burry1975: difficult decision for drijver here. Odds on he will bid|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: Actually, they've only completed one board there too :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: @S lead best for NS while N still has @HK as entry|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|s9|nt|burry1975: wrong bet :-)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: Paulissen just requested the TD to come to the table|pg||
nt|sybarra: easy to see from here about the spade lead not so easy at the table perhaps |pg||
nt|sybarra: if I lead AK and a @S  usually it is opp who has 5 @S |pg||
pc|s5|nt|sharkey: usually what happens to me...|pg||
nt|xenya: this shouldn't be too difficult|pg||
nt|sharynr: not having made a negative double, with 3 good trumps and spades well stopped|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pg||
nt|vugraphzbt: Bas, my fellow vugraph, seems to have a bad today. we'll need to restart after this board, scores are written in a wrong manner...|pg||
nt|sharynr: and more importantly, down 46 imps|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jeanhari: 7 tricks here, more interesting in pairs|pg||
pc|s7|pc|d2|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sharkey: Paulissen has ensured 7 tricks now|pg||
nt|sharynr: ok no prob natalia|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|pc|c4|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|nt|sybarra: might even play if differently in pairs|pg||
nt|sybarra: or the same and grab your 7 tricks |pg||
pc|d3|pc|d6|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|s3|nt|sharkey: 9 possible|pg||
