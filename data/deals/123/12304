nt|chick: Hello Everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: welcome everyone :)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: rehi all! easy 6 @H to start with|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: Eliasson will get a nice surprise as his partner opens the bidding with 1@H :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: hmm 7 maybe?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: Good Morning everyone and welcome back to Linköping and the final rounds of the swedish premier league. We will follow the outcome of the match between BK Lyx and Örebridgen, both ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: fighting to stay in the top division|pg||

mb|p|nt|kaapo: Nope|pg||
mb|1C|nt|col3435: looks like a normal 3NT here then|pg||
nt|joemanjo: Hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: rehi Staffan|pg||

nt|chick: should easily find 3N here|pg||
nt|kaapo: Swedes love strong or 2-way club|pg||
nt|col3435: some well-fitting cards here|pg||
mb|1H|nt|mmmakela: bridge is one of the few sports where playing home is not that great an advantage|pg||
nt|suketbombi: HI all|pg||
nt|suketbombi: n-s play Demicoma a strong club 16+ convention and 12-15 NT|pg||
mb|1N|nt|chick: Hi again, Staffan :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Commentators Cornelia Yoder and Bob McPhee|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and Kari Patana|pg||
nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||

mb|p|nt|kaapo: Hejssan :)|pg||
nt|joemanjo: Hi Vladimir|pg||
mb|2H|nt|suketbombi: while e-w play a std convention|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: N has a rotten rdbl hand|pg||
nt|kaapo: Hejssan alla|pg||
nt|joemanjo: This looks like a West Bengal vs Delhi match. NS and EW respectively.|pg||
mb|3S|nt|varange: welcome to the Swedish Premier League.|pg||
nt|joemanjo: Hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: 1NT is about 17-19 here I suppose|pg||
nt|col3435: at least declarer has something to think about on this lead|pg||
nt|varange: NS played pretty slowly during the previous session|pg||
nt|othered1: Looks like they're headed for an easy 4@S|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|kaapo: Straightforward bidding|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  Hello, Markku. Good evening to all|pg||
nt|kaapo: Did 3NT show clubs or @S shortness or something else?|pg||
mb|p|nt|varange: which meant that the OR caught up|pg||
nt|kaapo: 1NT = clubs or GF relay?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  Hello, Kari.|pg||
pc|h9|nt|mmmakela: 3433 and 9 with no intermeds|pg||
nt|mcphee: 3nt a nice spot|pg||
nt|xenya: good stop but still an awkward contract|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes shd be a flat bd which is a good news for Khandelwals|pg||
nt|othered1: Possible without @C system for north to be declarer, but on this hand it doesn't matter|pg||
pc|h5|nt|kaapo: Hi Cornelia, Markku and Staffan|pg||
nt|chick: hard to pass with 2 aces though|pg||
nt|chick: and a lively first round of bidding dies quite suddenly|pg||
nt|rnc: For Running Scores, time schedule etc during the tournament: http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_plugins/content/content.php?content.877|pg||
nt|kaapo: Hi|pg||
nt|mmmakela: only guess who might have all 3 trumps|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: short @S and not min|pg||
pc|h2|nt|chick: now that E sees that he set up the spades, he has to start grabbing tricks before losers can be pitched|pg||
nt|kaapo: Clubs will easily bring enough tricks for EW and luckily South hasn't got too high a heart in order to get a chance to play twice through West|pg||
nt|chick: with no entries, N must try to get to partner's hand again for another @H through|pg||
nt|col3435: if East is showing his shape this could turn out well|pg||
nt|kaapo: Ten tricks on top and 2 diamond ruffs bring it to twelve. 4-0 clubs shouldn't do much harm|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|joemanjo: Both sides play Standard with variations|pg||
pc|sA|nt|burypies: tajemnicza 8@d|pg||
nt|kaapo: Hopefully 4@H was alerted too :)|pg||
pc|s7|nt|kaapo: Or are they playing with screens?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mmmakela: needs C A right here for starters,now might even make this akward contract|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|kaapo: North might have some slam ambitions, if there are no wasted @S values|pg||
nt|rnc: For Running Scores, time schedule etc during the tournament: http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_plugins/content/content.php?content.877|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: north has shown 1-4 in majors with 5+@D here|pg||
nt|kaapo: Tack, Staffan|pg||
nt|vugraphzck: missed play...c\will claim at the end|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mcphee: all over now|pg||
nt|varange: Ralf Willquist will be able to fill us in on most of the play as he knows the players|pg||
nt|varange: and our operator at the venue, Steffan, will keep us updated|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a big mistake to reach 6@s here. -2 if they can find the @c ruff on NS|pg||
pc|s6|nt|burypies: Weijknis wiedzia³ ze 2! to dwukolorówka?|pg||
nt|burypies: 2@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzbf: tak wyjanione przed wistem|pg||
nt|burypies: je¿eli tak powinien zagraæ D@d|pg||
nt|burypies: wiedzia³ ¿e  rozgrywaj¹cy ma singla @d|pg||
nt|kaapo: I believe NS play 2-way club. North would open 1@C with 11-13 balanced, so he has kind of maximum|pg||
nt|mmmakela: I surely would because now 1 @S was forcing in my book and he passed!|pg||
nt|kaapo: I tried commentating in Swedish too, but my typing was a bit too slow in that language. I might do better now that PO is playing, though ;)|pg||
nt|varange: should be bid - ask Roland :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: I doubt even Roland would approve of this one :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: no screens, no alert since swedish rules say no alerting above 3nt|pg||
pc|s5|nt|kaapo: Ok, then no alerts beyond 3NT|pg||
nt|col3435: opps had probably got the idea by that point anyway :)|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|kaapo: A kib suggests that 4@H was RKC in clubs|pg||
nt|suketbombi: will end up making 5@S|pg||
pc|d4|nt|varange: what systems do they play Ralf?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree Staffan!|pg||
nt|joemanjo: North may be AshiM Mukherjee - if so he is a player in the Indian Railways B team.|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dA|nt|col3435: mm. So presumably 3@h showed 4414 exactly|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|d2|nt|xenya: should make with a careful play though, and he is on the right track|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dK|nt|col3435: easy with spades breaking - but how would you play if South had five?|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ralfwil: strong @c from both pairs  - Staffan?|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ralfwil: EW does and I thing NS too|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: yes, strong club, 17+, from both as far as i can see|pg||
nt|kaapo: The web site for the tournament is here http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_plugins/content/content.php?content.877|pg||
pc|s8|nt|kaapo: You'll find running scores there too|pg||
nt|xenya: now another trump and @C hook |pg||
nt|xenya: but this line fails -- |pg||
nt|xenya: not clear why he decided to shorten himself in trumps, losing control|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|rnc: For Running Scores, time schedule etc during the tournament: http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_plugins/content/content.php?content.877|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hT|nt|varange: NT is 14-16?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|kaapo: It's very normal in Sweden to play 3rd and 5th leads, even against notrumps. Nyström - Wrang seem not to do it, though|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: I would say most swedes play 3rd-5th vs suit and 4th vs NT|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|kaapo: And you can see that it's quite close in the top|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|c4|nt|mdgraham: Good afternoon all|pg||
pc|c8|nt|mmmakela: u right Kari 1c includes 10-12 nt so I take back my words|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|d7|pc|c7|pc|cT|nt|kaapo: Yes, that's a sensible agreement|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|mdgraham: This match seems a lot closer |pg||
mc|11|nt|chick: S cannot afford to try for an overtrick and lose a bunch of spades|pg||

nt|vugraphzpx: i would say they are pretty good, noone knows how good he is in a speedy :) I can ask him though... :)|pg||
nt|chick: Hello Everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: if south has 5 spades, the best way must be to play the 8 of clubs and let it go round to north|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: or even a small one|pg||
nt|col3435: yes that's nice|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes and the favoriates are trailing makes it more interesting|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: nice 4@H contract here|pg||
nt|kaapo: Rehi Cornelia|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  hello, Cornelia|pg||
nt|kaapo: 1NT looks interesting|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 1 nt seems needing swings|pg||
nt|kaapo: What does that show, then? :)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  if E decided to open 1nt, good ending could be 3nt |pg||
nt|kaapo: 10-13, might be off-shap?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  guess @d right - "only"|pg||
nt|joemanjo: What wd u open as North?|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: yes, 26 imps can be found in 14 boards without doing much more than playing good bridge and getting a little lucky to have active hands.|pg||
mb|1C|nt|kaapo: Well, no need to interfere with his play :)|pg||
nt|frankaus: g'day all|pg||
nt|kaapo: North may get to open here, unless West finds 1@H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@C|pg||
nt|joemanjo: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: need to reach 5@D |pg||
nt|chick: is he known as a particularly slow player?  :)|pg||
nt|xenya: the 3@D preempt in the other room was overdoing it|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|varange: hi Frank|pg||
mb|2H|nt|kaapo: I suppose Johan and PO at least play 2-way club|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: chick, sundelin is known as one of the slowest swedish players ever... :)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mmmakela: N won't sell|pg||
nt|mdgraham: curious no 1@s overcall by North|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: 2-way club, where 1@C shows either a strong hand or a weak notrump range, is often referred to as Swedish club|pg||
nt|joemanjo: 2@C and 2N take up valuable space to show a black two suiter.|pg||
nt|suketbombi: N-s have a good @S partial|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mmmakela: 14-16 Nt maybe?|pg||
nt|chick: certainly doesn't look like a hand that I would upgrade|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: 13-17NT from start, 2@D showed 13-15 without 4c major|pg||
nt|chick: :)|pg||
nt|mcphee: PO thinks his partners minor is @C:)|pg||
nt|chick: good thing I don't have a lot to do today then :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I am told NS play VERY sound overcalls - and it surely seems so|pg||
pc|h6|nt|kaapo: I guess 1NT = 14-16|pg||
nt|kaapo: Some might bid some number of diamonds as West|pg||
nt|kaapo: Even if East doesn't lead a club, he'll get another chance|pg||
nt|kaapo: Unless he ducks a spade|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: this board is wrong duplicated. Not much, but the ace of heart is located at east, not at south|pg||
nt|kaapo: Makes a little more sense then|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  single?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: south stole the 9 of D from east|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: so east holds 3253 with A7 in hearts|pg||
nt|kaapo: Mikael and Cilla are in the minority for Swedish experts: they don't play strong/2-way club|pg||
nt|kaapo: Their system of choice is short club with transfers|pg||
pc|h2|nt|frankaus: @D lead would have proved troublesome|pg||
nt|xenya: well if he decided to treat has hand as balanced, it makes sense|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|xenya: whether it is balanced is doubtful though|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sA|nt|chick: almost any lead gives away a trick|pg||
pc|s2|nt|kaapo: Well, unless the other room plays the board similarly distorted, this has to be canceled|pg||
nt|mmmakela: so S has 10982 in dias?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: it´s the same at all other tables.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: yes, south holds 10982 in @d|pg||
nt|suketbombi: a @C lead or shift wud restrict to 3 or else 4 makable|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: Witam!|pg||
nt|vugraphzbf: witamy nowych komentatorów |pg||
nt|abunio: witamy z Gdanska :)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: ns play 2-way club Staffan? Carrot?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: 2@C asking for majors, 2@D relay with lots of different hands, 2@H/2@S/2NT/3@C/3@D invitational|pg||
nt|chick: and N puts him to the test immediately, before he can get any other info|pg||
nt|kaapo: Of couse he does have @DQ and might get a trick with it|pg||
nt|chick: but N still has to find the @DQ|pg||
nt|mcphee: sure, nice bold play before anyones knows what is up|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6@C makes but it's not great. It takes more than the heart finesse|pg||
pc|d5|nt|othered1: That's a *really* positional style|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d6|nt|varange: choices choices|pg||
nt|xenya: all S's honours work and he knows it|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|kaapo: @H8 looked discouraging|pg||
nt|chick: club switch still isn't clear though|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sfoxa:  so, we'll be unable to follow the play right - just enter result? |pg||
nt|kaapo: This seems to happen rarely but occasionally with the duplicating machines|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: we can follow the play as long as they wont play hearts... :)|pg||
nt|kaapo: In Beijing we had a normal bidding sequence and I ended up at 3NT|pg||
nt|mmmakela: we can until certain point but did S really pitch a dia|pg||
nt|kaapo: When I examined the dummy, I noticed our side had two diamond queens!|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: yes, south did pitch the 2 of @d|pg||
nt|mmmakela: very strange|pg||
nt|frankaus: still makes with 3@H 3@C 2@S + 1@D|pg||
nt|col3435: I guess you finish drawing trumps and try to cash some clubs, but when that doesn't work, what do you do?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Besides, if declarer is not careful, he may go down|pg||
pc|sK|nt|chick: now should just lose the top trumps|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s8|pg||
nt|kaapo: It may get dangerous now, if he finesses trumps|pg||
nt|kaapo: Some also play Smith echo in the suit declarer first attacks (if count isn't relevant). If that's the case, @D2 might suggest finding another suit, too|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Must ruff one spade low and one high|pg||
nt|xenya: i think it's basically on a @H finesse -- barring something really bad in trumps or @Hs|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mcphee: going to be a costly misguess sadly|pg||
pc|h4|nt|col3435: ruff the club out and play for the @dA to be right?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|kaapo: Hmm, he attacked @S first :)|pg||
nt|varange: oops|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|kaapo: On the other hand he seems to be home now if trumps are 3-2|pg||
nt|chick: one more round of trump, then set up clubs?|pg||
nt|col3435: of course you can get away with anything as the cards lie|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ralfwil: I had prefered to signal for a @d shift by playing @s10|pg||
nt|kaapo: Yes, black suits were a bit bad but anything else is right|pg||
nt|suketbombi: here is a happy man with T tricks|pg||

nt|suketbombi: atleast the effort is made here:)|pg||
mb|3S|nt|kaapo: I think 1@C is natural or balanced|pg||
nt|kaapo: And 1@H shows spades|pg||
nt|chick: which never works for me, but it seems to for everyone else :)|pg||

nt|varange: a clear violation of Burns' Law, Ralf?|pg||
nt|col3435: South must bid again here, but what?|pg||

nt|col3435: was difficult to do more though|pg||
nt|joemanjo: dbl worked |pg||
nt|xenya: agree -- double stands out|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Important for West to cover the @d 10|pg||

nt|col3435: I don't see anything too bad in this auction, it just doesn't happen to get there|pg||

nt|col3435: I guess you can just see what develops|pg||

nt|mmmakela: @S K and then|pg||
nt|kaapo: They didn't, and neither did the open room|pg||
nt|frankaus: well not real garbagge and not short in @C so i would not  use it here|pg||
nt|varange: yep|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes! 1nt is good enough|pg||
nt|varange: Burns' Law: As declarer, one should strive to have more trumps than one's opponents|pg||
nt|varange: in some ways easier if playing the big 2NT, SAYC style|pg||
nt|xenya: if E is weak, he can take remove to 3@S -- the position is quite clear adter W's initial pass |pg||
mb|p|mb|6C|nt|burypies: ale Witek im namiesza³ |pg||
nt|kaapo: 3@D might be 17-19 NT with 4 spades - but just guessing|pg||
nt|mcphee: make 3N i think|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|chick: not sure I would have led a trump on that auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: Without the double, North would bid 1@D to show 0-7. Difficult to tell what 1@S shows here|pg||
nt|suketbombi: got there :)|pg||

nt|col3435: yeah, why not @sJ and run it if West follows low|pg||
pc|dA|nt|chick: W might Q-ask |pg||
nt|kaapo: In case I was about right about the early bids, 3@H could be a re-tranafer and 3NT some kind of slam try follows by two cue bids|pg||
nt|kaapo: Fredin - Lindkvist had an even more straightforward sequence to 7@H|pg||
nt|col3435: but here west shows out, and if he allows the @h7 to score it's all over|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: west has the option of discarding 2 diamonds on the 3rd and 4th round of spade, denying the 6of H to score|pg||

pc|d2|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: moimi prywatnymi faworytami s¹ licytacje sprzedajace te same walory po kilkakroæ|pg||
nt|kaapo: And 4@H could then be a "last train" kind of bid - still interested in slam but without a heart control|pg||
nt|kaapo: Apparently not much :)|pg||
nt|kaapo: So pitching a club here looks a reasonable plan|pg||
nt|yuval10: indeed|pg||
nt|col3435: hmm, there's too much to do though isn't there?|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 3@S showed a delayed support hence doubleton Honor and 4@H was quebid|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Maybe even 10|pg||
mb|1D|an| |nt|kaapo: 4@S or 3NT here?|pg||

nt|mcphee: easy @S game, interesting to see how far N/S will push|pg||
nt|kaapo: 6@S could make but is missing two key cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: 4@H will look tasty to NS, but also to W |pg||
nt|ralfwil: first morning slam in @d|pg||
nt|col3435: perhaps South could bid 4@d over 3NT then.|pg||
nt|varange: I can see that N wouldnt be happy|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@S let through on board 2|pg||
nt|othered1: I guess north thinks this hand is too good for 15 point 1N.  I tend to agree|pg||
nt|suketbombi: the system is called Demicoma Destructive Minor Constructive Major|pg||
mb|2D|an| |nt|kaapo: Difficult to play either after 5@D|pg||

mb|3N|an| |nt|suketbombi: so 1D shows nothing about @Ds but atleast 1 or both Majors|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: Unlikely they'd get that high, though, unless really pushed|pg||
nt|mcphee: does the 2@S bid show game interest for @H?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: 2@S was pass/correct. |pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: 1@D, I believe, shows about 11-16 with 4+@D and an unbalanced hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: N will expect partner to have @s singleton|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: 10-15 actually|pg||
nt|mcphee: or just an invitation + for @H?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes, but @d is better|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: do i start with a Roland slam :) ?|pg||
pc|h7|nt|mmmakela: supp dbl in spades|pg||
nt|chick: do you suppose 1@H is transfer advance showing spades?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: y|pg||
nt|kaapo: Nyström made a slight overbid with 4@D, but his @DAQ had grown in strength over 3@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: Wrang explained the 4@D wrong it seems, 4@D showed game forcing without short D|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: with spade support of course|pg||
nt|kaapo: 2@D Multi, showing a weak two in either of the majors (or perhaps some strong hand)|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 1nt denies Major unless 4-3-3-3|pg||
nt|othered1: Nicely j udged lead|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|Walddk2: Nothing wrong with this slam|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: actually a good slam... need only to find @Hq|pg||

nt|vugraphzpx: max 14-15 |pg||
nt|xenya: 10 tricks are available, yes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's around 50%, not bad at all|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: maybe even better with the 9 card fit|pg||

nt|varange: <-- being facetious|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That's 53%, singleton queen or 2-2, but ....|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: maybe north shd have started a cuebid with 3@S|pg||

pc|h4|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: 4@H showed a good raise to 4@S|pg||
nt|kaapo: Perhaps West could bid a minor suit to suggest a maximum with hearts?|pg||
nt|kaapo: 8 teams remain in the top division so there's lot to play for even for Örebridgen. They're currently 6th, 4.5 VPs ahead of the 8th positioned team|pg||

nt|joemanjo: That lead is good. Now 10 wll be difficult.|pg||

nt|sunsamvar: wow u have the %s at the tip of your fingers Roland|pg||
nt|vugraphzck: miskey - play out of turn - claiming at the end|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, I know when to bid my 12.89% slams|pg||

nt|mmmakela: well clubs are 3-2 and the A right|pg||
pc|d2|nt|kaapo: I'm not very fond of West's 2@S but perhaps that was another small deception: he was trying to convince NS they should go to 4@H|pg||
nt|othered1: Probably depends on what north things their lead style would imply here.    To my eyes, 7 is an interesting card|pg||

nt|mdgraham: Good morning all.|pg||
nt|othered1: do we know what 3@H showed?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: why save in 4@S when you can save in 3@S?|pg||
pc|h6|nt|kaapo: 3NT is easy, but will they go higher?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Sorry if my analyses are not as crisp as they usually are (:) ahem) - I've been a bit poorly|pg||
pc|h4|nt|kaapo: 1@D was max 15 HCP, so it's not so clear to raise to 3|pg||

nt|kaapo: Pass was my first instinct with just "quacks"|pg||

nt|sunsamvar: well bid in the end|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mcphee: i am sure PO will thank him later|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: but 4@S will dampen east... |pg||
pc|sA|nt|joemanjo: If u say so, Roland it must be really terrible.|pg||
nt|xenya: but 4@S is solid|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sK|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|pc|dK|nt|chick: strong spots in hearts, and all suits well-behaved, so he will make this|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: easy claim after 1 round of trumps|pg||
nt|mdgraham: bidding 4@H with the North hand looks a bit, er, well shall we say percentgae|pg||
nt|othered1: 3 @H rather|pg||
pc|c5|nt|chick: he is playing this perfectly, given the chance to make|pg||
nt|mmmakela: will try the dias hook for 9th|pg||

nt|yuval10: now he won't even need that spectacular finish|pg||
pc|cK|nt|frankaus: smooth sailing fro here|pg||
pc|s3|nt|kaapo: 1@C was strong. Interesting to see that West didn't have any fancy convention but simply bid his best suit|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|chick: the @C7 just became a big card|pg||
nt|kaapo: I don't really see much better here than to hope for @CA at East|pg||

pc|s2|pc|sK|nt|dagold: was trying to understand what happend on board 2 when I was asked to commentate!|pg||
nt|lestergold: and south showed extras unfortunately north wasnt excited by the club bid|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s3|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Well, North has 7 losers and should normally not make a game try (6 loser hand does). The question is if 2@H was an underbid|pg||
pc|c2|nt|april7: after the pass by N, the 2 @S bid by E not vulnerable is quite ok imo|pg||
pc|cA|nt|dagold: these sort of hands solved easily by bergen type. where south would have a bid to show 4 trumps and not wuite a limit raise|pg||

nt|kaapo: That had some potential for our first swing board|pg||
nt|kaapo:  15 was push: down one in both rooms|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think you can make 6@S even on a trump lead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but then again maybe 3@H was weak|pg||
nt|mdgraham: told 3@H=4@H with 0-6 hcp.|pg||
nt|othered1: I'm told: 3@H less than 6 pts-- then it was an underbid to my eyes|pg||
mb|p|nt|arvid: 1@D is 4+ and always unbalanced|pg||
nt|chick: in the previous hand?|pg||

mb|p|nt|kaapo: For EW in a contract declared ny East|pg||
nt|mmmakela: N must save|pg||
nt|frankaus: this will be a easy  hand for declarer with everything working|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Win the ace. Ruff one heart after giving up one and squeeze South in clubs and hearts|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: may get to 3 nt here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no singleton?|pg||
nt|othered1: do you repoen as easat?|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: Would you overcall 3@C?|pg||
nt|kaapo: Apparently 2@C is showing the majors|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes|pg||
mb|2C|an| |nt|chick: this one is nice 3N if they can bid it|pg||
nt|kaapo: Staffan does wisely and concentrates on the board actually being played. That's a good advice for any bridge player :)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: now tough for S|pg||
nt|frankaus: now the save|pg||
nt|kaapo: If NS are good guessers, they could make 4@S|pg||
nt|yuval10: 4@s looks like a fair-chance contract but both A@D offside and 4-1 trump will doom it|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: dbl or 2@C graham ?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, either could be right. 2@C has the advantage of bidding the good suit... |pg||
nt|suketbombi: 12-15 no major or 4-3-3-3 if there is a major|pg||
mb|p|nt|burypies: raz Witek siê pogubi³ na tej rozgrywce ale ogólnie naprawdê bardzo dobrze|pg||

nt|mmmakela: will W balance?|pg||
nt|chick: I would|pg||
nt|arvid: I would|pg||
nt|kaapo: I guess I would too|pg||
nt|kaapo: Unapparently 4@C is asking to pick a major|pg||
nt|frankaus: pass  at 50s would be my action 2|pg||
nt|mmmakela: not the expected one|pg||
nt|kaapo: 10 down = 500|pg||
nt|frankaus: -10  = 500|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 4 H dbld cheaper|pg||
nt|frankaus: yes but hard to  be certain its not 800|pg||
nt|mmmakela: come on after 4 @C!|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, win @SA, then ruff a @H and eventually there is a squeeze against S|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 2 @C for me anyday|pg||
mb|2D|an| |nt|kaapo: The web site (mostly in Swedish) is here somewhere: http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_plugins/content/content.php?content.877|pg||
nt|kaapo: @S to queen, then run 7|pg||
nt|othered1: would be nice if west can bid 2@D for longer suit|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 2@C is majors  2@D pick yours|pg||
mb|d|nt|chick: would you?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: after the pause is a club lead ethical?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: yes|pg||
nt|mcphee: lots down|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: no double no trouble :)|pg||
nt|kaapo: But just 50 each|pg||
nt|col3435: ok, I guess even on three rounds of diamonds declarer would probably go down there.|pg||
mb|2S|nt|kaapo: 2@D was some kind of Multi: showing a weak two bid in either major (or possibly some strong hand)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: they will land in 2@h now instead of 2@s, if S had opened with 1@s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: South has all the important cards. @CQJ and @HKQ|pg||
nt|othered1: Is south thinking of doing something?  Did north's original pass show some values?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jkmjanusz: Po przepuszczeniu @H Damy Kasprzak zmieni³ wista na @S !!|pg||
nt|kaapo: Apparently 2@H was a simple reverse, a little light but with nice 3-card support for partner and great controls|pg||
nt|kaapo: Diamond split is very cruel, in case they end up at some number of dimonds|pg||
nt|kaapo: What is the 1NT range here, Staffan?|pg||
nt|frankaus: 2@H will make so no real harm|pg||
nt|varange: the one is as good as the other?|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: not necessarily a pause... remember the operator cannot enter bids until both people on one side of the screen have bid|pg||
nt|varange: friendly breaks either way|pg||
nt|yuval10: if he guess it that would be something :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but double shows the three-suiter and is possibly more flexible, and would therefore score 10/10 in a bidding competition|pg||
nt|mdgraham: board 5 - game missed at othert table as well|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 2nt knowing there is a minor fit|pg||
mb|2N|an| |nt|kaapo: 14-16?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: not sure, 14-16 or 15-17|pg||
mb|p|nt|abunio: raz tez Misiak umozliwil piekna rozgrywke, ale na pewno niebyl to blad prosty|pg||
nt|mmmakela: if Lebens this promises values(3@C)|pg||
nt|mcphee: they blew n/s out of 3N|pg||
nt|mmmakela: still wd EW|pg||
nt|varange: you'd open the south hand 1@s Frank?|pg||
nt|varange: or 1NT?|pg||
nt|frankaus: many here include 5M332 in their NT range - klinger has  a great influence here a he recomends it|pg||
nt|xenya: but this is very double dummy|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @C is only 5-card - d is best|pg||
nt|hawe45:  D|pg||
nt|othered1: "Knowing" may be a bit strong, if south could have 4=3=3=3 with 4-card major|pg||
nt|suketbombi: ok but they got 4 for there 200|pg||
mb|3D|nt|chick: that's one advantage of not bidding clubs, don't give away the bad distribution|pg||
nt|kaapo: Of course would be more cruel still, if South had them|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: they play lebensohl|pg||
nt|chick: if it promises clubs, that's ok with N|pg||
nt|mcphee: :)|pg||
nt|chick: but with a nice heart fit, it is trouble, double or not|pg||
mb|p|nt|arvid: If east had the jack of diamonds 6@D would have been a very good slam|pg||
nt|kaapo: Wrang saw short clubs with partner and opts for the 4-3 @S game|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: We had a lost connection at the other table which means board  15 isnt scored properly. The result in the open room was 6@S made, which should give another 14imps for Team Zang|pg||
nt|chick: he must win the @SA, so can ruff two clubs with the small trumps|pg||
nt|mmmakela: making 13|pg||
nt|yuval10: either way EW can make 10 tricks in @h because of the 87 doubleton @d so -1 in 4@s isn't so bad|pg||
nt|joemanjo: yes, missed the qj of clubs|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but with these suit discrepancies I would bid 2@C - always a good overcall of 1@D|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes that is rare N is known to take chances|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: so then very nice auction|pg||
nt|frankaus: will be nervous about the @D situation|pg||
nt|varange: the 8@h is a big card|pg||
mb|p|nt|varange: AQxxx isn't that flash anyway|pg||
nt|frankaus: yes  then i play garbage 2@C and puppet 3@C for all game going hands|pg||
nt|varange: ok|pg||
nt|varange: nice treatment|pg||
nt|col3435: can East just continue hearts here?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: yes he can|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: well he has only 3 carder @S and a very weak 4 card @H suit|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: easy on a @D lead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East will do very well to lead a spade here|pg||
nt|suketbombi: everyone is happy here|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mmmakela: well S never thinks with his 10-12.....|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: there are no screens |pg||
nt|mmmakela: against 2-way club most treat it as supposing the weak variation and W didn't bid after 1 @C so has clubs now if thinking one could assume|pg||
nt|mmmakela: even that was meant priv sry|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but, on the bidding, he may well do so - no, he has gone passive|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that's good - being happy is better than being miserable|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|burypies: a przeciwnicy siê szarpi¹ |pg||
nt|kaapo: How do you like 2@D (either direct or in the pass out seat)?|pg||

nt|sunsamvar: and my money is on him to pull off this contract|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Play out of turn? We have heard that before. They can't keep doing that, surely|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: what a pity... great hand for timing in declarer play|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You lost the play?|pg||
nt|vugraphzck: yes...dummy played before his own turn|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: play 2 @C and then the 2nd @H|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: but east can take the @Ha and clear @H|pg||
nt|suketbombi: a @S ruff in Dummy will promote def trumps|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sQ|nt|col3435: that would take some good guessing too :)|pg||

nt|joemanjo: I wonder where this will end. 3N or 5C? |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: multi 2@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: 3NT seems an interesting choice - I was thinking about 2NT or 4NT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, they won't get any here I fancy - this looks the flattest 4@S imaginable |pg||
mb|2C|nt|chick: E was about to bid spades, so now will he try his diamonds, or will he hide in the bushes and ambush a spade contract?|pg||
nt|chick: 2N obviously for the minors, not what N wanted to hear|pg||
nt|chick: and S violates rule  1 of preempts .... don't bid again unless forced.   But with 6-6, I can see the temptation|pg||
nt|kaapo: In the end, PO went one down and lost 12 IMPs|pg||
nt|varange: and made 10 tricks|pg||
nt|kaapo: Opening 4@S looks right|pg||
nt|col3435: agree|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: 3NT perhaps|pg||
nt|mcphee: too hi in everything I thinnk:)|pg||
nt|mcphee: good thing about this hand is they are not going to get dbled in 3N|pg||
nt|col3435: quick 4@s here then|pg||
nt|varange: that 4NT+2 got them 11 imps; 7@d-1 at the other table|pg||
nt|joemanjo: East has an easy defense if he starts off with @h honour|pg||
nt|othered1: @C lead can hold 3N to 4|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  hello to all, hi Roland|pg||
mb|p|nt|joemanjo: 2 down without breathing hard and more if declarer discards wrong.|pg||
nt|xenya: i don't like 1@D opening, but perhaps it's forced if you are not prepared to support  1@S response|pg||
mb|2S|nt|burypies: 1@s by³by w stylu Darlesu:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzbf: zasuwaj¹ tak, ¿ebym nie nad¹¿y³...|pg||
nt|kaapo: I might open 4NT if that shows both minors too|pg||
nt|chick: 2@C probably a precision-like bid showing 5-6 clubs and a 4 card major|pg||
nt|varange: one of our specs is having confit du canard - hmmmm, yummy|pg||
nt|ralfwil: perhaps best lead. declarer has to do all the work himself|pg||
nt|varange: yep|pg||
nt|varange: nice and neutral|pg||
nt|mdgraham: You have to bid 3@H, really.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: Lebensohl is a very good gimmick that can be used in many various situations|pg||
nt|mmmakela: really like this?|pg||
nt|kaapo: 2 down on a @C ruff|pg||
nt|frankaus: 5@D X will be a poor compensation for NS|pg||
nt|col3435: ah, the danger of bidding grands|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: yes, the players at the other table knew about the 6-2 in @d and bid 7. Bridge isnt fair... :)|pg||
nt|varange: dontcha hate it when underbids get the imps?|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|chick: It's a nearly perfect fit NS, and neither one knows about the other's singleton|pg||
nt|varange: too true Staffan|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: nice stab for n/s, just no tricks|pg||
nt|mcphee: maybe he can work some end play|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  and how W has to attack trumps immediately|pg||
nt|suketbombi:  showed 4 Hearts and up to 10 hcp|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes the vital imp|pg||
nt|othered1: We're going through some relays and responses, it seems.|pg||
mb|3S|an| |nt|mmmakela: quite a bid in red with W hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzbf: i kart nie pokazuj¹, które zagrywaj¹, chyba siê obra¿ê :)|pg||

mb|4S|an| |nt|chick: he may survive it|pg||
nt|chick: N needs to cash his @HA to avoid crashing it with one of S's honors|pg||
nt|chick: it looks like a good hand, but still have to trust partner|pg||
nt|arvid: good lead|pg||
nt|mcphee: should try @D|pg||
nt|xenya: 3N is hopeless of course|pg||
nt|suketbombi: oh ace asking:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: then switch to a spade and start tapping declarer|pg||
nt|arvid: now this will be 4 or 5 down|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: I´ve played several speedys and I am used to winning speedys :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: either 4 or 1 @s.... looks like P not an option|pg||

mc|11|nt|vugraphzpx: last time Ida Grönkvist picked me out for a speedy knowing i was the fastest one around... and we sure won at 67% too :)|pg||
nt|kaapo: The idea in a Speedy Gonzales bridge competition is that there's only a ridiculously short time per board to play|pg||
nt|arvid: sorry only 3, but much more difficult for east-west if south is declarer|pg||

nt|chick: I'll bet it means, the info is here :)|pg||
nt|kaapo: Sylvan keeps getting a lot of diamonds|pg||
nt|mmmakela: I would bid 6|pg||
nt|frankaus: Aces and singleton a re great combination|pg||
nt|varange: 4@sE in the OR|pg||
nt|varange: and another interesting layout ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzck: players taking a break|pg||
nt|suketbombi: could be that vital imp to texan aces here|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes 2 smokers there|pg||
nt|othered1: another easy game, likely making 4 since there's no clear reason to guess trumps correctly|pg||
nt|othered1: And no reason to overbid, unless somehow @D are thought to provide tricks|pg||
nt|suketbombi: auction will be 1@H- 2@H  and W will settle for 4|pg||
nt|suketbombi: even if E gets agressive with a Nt will get a 2@D response and will bid 3@H but sighn off after the que bid from W|pg||
nt|vugraphzck: awaiting S at the table|pg||
nt|vugraphzck: resuming play|pg||
mb|1H|nt|joemanjo: hmm 1@c?|pg||
nt|xenya: note that 3!N has no play even if @Cs are 2-2|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|kaapo: 1NT seems fine on the East cards|pg||
nt|chick: maybe he's a girl's best friend :)|pg||
nt|kaapo: 1@D is about 11-16 with 4+@D and suggests an unbalanced hand|pg||
nt|mcphee: 19 @S nice card for S hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: shall i ask him cornelia? :)|pg||
nt|kaapo: Surprising no pre-empt from N|pg||

mb|2S|nt|chick: 3 good spades|pg||
nt|kaapo: East has an interesting opening bid choice|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes he decided to underbid this|pg||
mb|3S|nt|col3435: on bd6, if East continued hearts, declarer would probably play another club with West showing out. Then west would be marked with all the cards in spades and diamonds, and it seems ...|pg||
nt|col3435: declarer could throw him in|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North has plenty to raise to 2@S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: when you six-card major is raised - bid game|pg||

nt|mmmakela: leb again|pg||
nt|chick: asking partner to bid 3@C|pg||
nt|kaapo: Or perhaps a transfer to clubs|pg||
nt|mcphee: 10@S I mean|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  EW reached their limit, what about NS?|pg||
nt|suketbombi: Jm has not finished:(|pg||
nt|othered1: but west has done more and east has a maximum, so|pg||
mb|4C|nt|mmmakela: would you show majs or treat S hand as 1-suiter|pg||
nt|xenya: strange pass by S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: You can understand why South bids 3@D, even though imho it is an overbid |pg||
mb|p|nt|varange: can you explain Ralf?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: still, push-em-up|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ...onward and possibly upward.... |pg||
mb|4H|nt|mmmakela: and direct 3 @C promising pos values|pg||
nt|chick: "transfer" implies that you have the suit.   in this case, it's more like a "relay" to clubs, with many possible hands|pg||
nt|kaapo: East had a very maximal hand and support for whatever suit West has and tries for game|pg||
nt|mmmakela: tries?|pg||
nt|kaapo: True, Cornelia, but many play real transfers in this position|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: East though seems unaware of that his partner has made a lebensohl bid |pg||
nt|kaapo: Your using keyboard input, Staffan?|pg||
nt|kaapo: *You're|pg||
nt|frankaus: nil vul is not so good to preempt|pg||
nt|kaapo: I didn't expect 2NT if EW play strong club, but I guess it's still an option|pg||
nt|mmmakela: grandmaproof 3 nt|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and West takes the bait|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  juicy 200?|pg||
nt|vugraphzck: S thinking hard|pg||
nt|suketbombi: in good time|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but seriously, East only bid 2@H |pg||
mb|p|nt|abunio: sorry, private|pg||
nt|burypies: w jakim kierunku zmierzaja?|pg||
nt|chick: majors|pg||
nt|kaapo: @S lead will bring the 8th trick|pg||
nt|kaapo: And if there are 8 there are 9, as the saying goes :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, it's teams, so not that important - as long as South is not tempted to bid 3@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|jkmjanusz: A ³adsna? Warto dzwoniæ?|pg||
nt|chick: in competitive bidding, I think need to give as many options to partner as you can|pg||
nt|kaapo: 800 may have been very expensive, because EW's 4@S didn't seem easy at all|pg||
nt|kaapo: 1@C strong - 1@D weak|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: yes, but looking at the wrong hand as well... :)|pg||
nt|varange: says he, belatedly :)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  S could expect partner with relatively long @c and @h|pg||
mb|p|nt|abunio: nie, do mojej mamy:)|pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: O, sorry...|pg||
nt|chick: if pard is not intereted, then can bid hearts|pg||
nt|frankaus: another friendly layout 4@D 2@C 1@H 2@S|pg||
nt|ralfwil: no! |pg||
nt|col3435: very much so :)|pg||
nt|col3435: nice though|pg||
nt|varange: yes|pg||
nt|xenya: double showed @Hs -- it would seem natural to bid your @S at that point|pg||
nt|othered1: Maybe the overcall will help west get trumps right|pg||
nt|othered1: for the requisite 1 imp per board|pg||
pc|d2|nt|chick: ok, but that's not lebensohl (for the benefit of kibs)|pg||
nt|kaapo: Yes, good to make the distinction clear|pg||
nt|mmmakela: not true Kaapo, most play leb here|pg||
nt|mcphee: this game may go down|pg||
nt|kaapo: As you see, D and S are adjacent on the keyboard. Easy to make "typos" if using keyboard input when operating :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: yeah, and all 13 cards are next to eachother so it´s easy to have a "clickos" for that :)|pg||
nt|mcphee: @C lead bad for the N hand|pg||
nt|kaapo: Well, you've been doing marvellously well :)|pg||
nt|varange: :) dang|pg||
nt|ralfwil: perhaps some kind of transfer|pg||
nt|varange: it seems that way|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: no alert on 1NT at least so I dont think they play it as transfer|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes and a singleton @D lead may confirm the trump position for OT|pg||
pc|d9|nt|mmmakela: N likes the lead but...|pg||
nt|col3435: good prediction - spade lead didn't look clear to me|pg||
pc|dT|nt|chick: as long as EW cash their minor winners, this cannot make|pg||
nt|kaapo: Some might use Lebensohl here. If it's in use, then South's 3@D shows some values; he'd bid 2NT with a very weak hand|pg||
nt|varange: wow|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|mmmakela: I hate playing in 4-2 when 6-1 was available(ok extreme case but 4-3 is probable)|pg||

nt|kaapo: @DJ would suffer the same, too|pg||
pc|h5|nt|chick: often opponents will compete, taking partner off the hook|pg||
nt|mmmakela: so 1-suiter for me|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|chick: and even if 4-2, opps cannot double (else you run to hearts)|pg||
nt|varange: then the DBL must have some unknown meaning|pg||
nt|varange: how would S interpret the 3@d|pg||
nt|suketbombi: sure imp for texans|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|nt|arvid: even if south is showing some values with 3@D I think his hand is too good|pg||
nt|col3435: yeah, and club is worse!|pg||
pc|hK|nt|chick: and to paraphrase your comment:   I hate playing in a 6-1 when 4-4 was available :)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: any opinions from kibs? majors or 1-suiter?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  small club from table?|pg||

nt|kaapo: And 1@C could be 2 cards, either natural unbalanced, or balanced|pg||
nt|col3435: I'd rather West bid 3@d the first time|pg||
nt|suketbombi: from Dalas Aces to Texan Aces:)|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mmmakela: ok sound contract, 5 can be in jeopardy|pg||
pc|cA|nt|kaapo: I see, tack Staffan|pg||
nt|kaapo: 2NT apparently shows a balanced hand, and now 4@C looks like a control bid with @H support|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|varange: here's the knr hand evaluator for the East hand|pg||
nt|varange: http://www.jeffgoldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=AQ9xx+Kxx+AKx+Kx|pg||
nt|varange: 19.85 HCP|pg||
nt|othered1: East can get @D ruff, if they're really careful|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|kaapo: I'd bid 3, also|pg||
pc|dA|nt|varange: yes, provided the X promised spades|pg||
nt|varange: how many will declarer be off?|pg||
nt|varange: 3?|pg||
pc|d5|nt|kaapo: Yes, lots of working finesses too|pg||
nt|kaapo: If @Hs are 4-1, you might still make 6NT while 6@H fails|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|mdgraham: he has to get the ruff with a low trump|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so South has to lead @SQ (no entry to dummy) and West has to duck it - very difficult |pg||
nt|suketbombi: @SJ has to be ducked by JM|pg||
nt|othered1: But possible, as play of interion @S would be very tricky from AQJ|pg||
nt|othered1: interior|pg||
nt|vugraphzck: S thinking.....|pg||
nt|suketbombi: :) you need to know your customer|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sT|nt|mmmakela: perfect for action dbl/2 NT choose the minor|pg||
pc|s5|nt|chick: If 2N is Jacoby, 3N shows 14-15.  |pg||
nt|mmmakela: 10 and next|pg||
nt|kaapo: It seems South is just relaying here|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|suketbombi: easy now|pg||
pc|dK|nt|kaapo: 5@H likely normal RKCB response, two key cards without the queen of hearts|pg||
nt|mcphee: yes, but I think they will play @H|pg||
nt|suketbombi: not tested|pg||
pc|d7|nt|mmmakela: needed a H lead and cashout|pg||
nt|chick: needed a heart back, now S can pitch the 2nd heart|pg||
nt|mmmakela: was too late|pg||
nt|kaapo: South had no fast entry to dummy?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: it was too late when east returned a club. East could return a diamond since South has no direct entry to dummy for a club finesse|pg||
pc|h4|nt|burypies: po kierowym tak|pg||
nt|kaapo: And North has likely described his full shape by now|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: North has shown 4315, 8-9p|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|kaapo: And strength within one point range (likely restricted due to not opening the bidding)|pg||
nt|kaapo: Ed Schapiro prefers 5@C to 3NT|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d8|pc|sA|nt|kaapo: North did have an unexpected high singleton|pg||

nt|yuval10: follows by 6@c over 5@d |pg||
nt|yuval10: quite hard|pg||
mb|2S|an| |nt|kaapo: Many would open the South hand nowadays. Surprising to see a strong clubber pass it|pg||
nt|frankaus: not many would pass|pg||
nt|col3435: I thought it was because he didn't feel the hand was good enough with a misfit, but evidently it was more because he wanted the penalty|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: 1@C was either balanced or natural|pg||
nt|othered1: @D split makes 4@S a potential problem|pg||
nt|mdgraham: could this be 6@S in one room and 2@S in the other.....|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: 2@D looks like natural, nonforcing call|pg||

mb|p|nt|xenya: no, but later you might have to guess whether partner has a 3-card support for @Ss|pg||

nt|mmmakela: pd opened in fav zone 10 points....|pg||
nt|kaapo: Wow, a natural system played in Swedish premmier league!|pg||
nt|yuval10: pass, if forcing, is very good by S|pg||

nt|othered1: I'd guess that in CR the NS *Know* they have a bad result . . .|pg||
nt|mdgraham: superficially, yes :) but one result is worse than the other, depending on your point of view  |pg||
pc|s2|nt|sfoxa:  what is the probability of finding all 13 cards?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not sure|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|col3435: well, like that, evidently :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: after Pass by S i think she MUST bid it|pg||
nt|kaapo: By eptying the box save 7@S and 7NT|pg||
nt|col3435: if pass is forcing|pg||
nt|yuval10: the play will be interesting...... she might know that W has only 3 @s's from the bid|pg||
nt|yuval10: she can ruff 2 @d's..... and see that E has 3|pg||
nt|kaapo: Has West still something to think about?|pg||
nt|yuval10: then 8-1-3-1|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|chick: its not impossible that S will switch to spades, hoping to remove the entry to diamonds|pg||
nt|kaapo: North seems to have a chance for 10 tricks, if he raises the heart suit first|pg||
nt|yuval10: i belive she'll make it|pg||
nt|yuval10: sry HE will make it|pg||
nt|yuval10: because S is declarer|pg||
nt|kaapo: Cilla might make a comment about him never presenting a good dummy, and her showing an example :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: i think S will like the dummy he'll see :)  he knows it's a reasonable grand, now only have to make!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I think he will|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Would Haglund bid 6@S with @CQx?|pg||
nt|suketbombi: here too they wud think 10 imps gone|pg||
pc|d4|nt|burypies: czasami nawet Witek ma piki|pg||
nt|kaapo: Apparently their 2NT opening was something like 22-24|pg||
nt|mmmakela: -1|pg||
nt|kaapo: So 2@C followed by 2NT would be say 20-21|pg||
nt|varange: agreed|pg||
pc|d6|nt|Walddk4: Must have a lot of shape for that|pg||
nt|yuval10: lead @d will make it easier for him |pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d2|pg||
nt|kaapo: This seems to lose 2 spades, @D and @C|pg||
nt|kaapo: After North's fine spade switch|pg||
pc|dA|nt|chick: this works to kill the diamonds, but let's W have 2 diamond tricks|pg||
nt|mmmakela: now 8|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: might endplay North|pg||
pc|d5|pc|c4|nt|xenya: lucky layout for EW|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|mdgraham: looks like 4@c was an auto-splinter (a splinter agreeing my suit), but the values outside are quite soft|pg||
nt|mdgraham: incidentally, that last board - why did East play a club back after the @SA?|pg||
pc|d8|pc|s7|nt|mmmakela: yes although obvious many wouldn't make it|pg||
pc|s9|nt|kaapo: Still more IMPs for Skalman on boards 19 (stopped at 3@S) and 20 (3NT went down)|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mmmakela: next a club and then N must find H switch|pg||

nt|vugraphzbf: imp straty?|pg||
nt|varange: there is no justice!|pg||

pc|h8|pg||
nt|yuval10: @h to T, A@d and @d ruff|pg||
nt|kaapo: So it's very important for Örebridgen that Mikael makes this, which does seem quite likely|pg||

nt|lestergold: not first time Kista has pushed boat out|pg||
nt|dagold: would have thought 2@s plenty and accept if partne bids on|pg||
nt|dagold: the whole point of transfers is that you get two bids|pg||
nt|dima:  Unless playing some special things that 3@s is a VERY intetresting bid|pg||
nt|april7: 3@S???|pg||
nt|lestergold: North must be thinking of slam possibilities!!|pg||
nt|dagold: North might be thinking of more. I don't blame him|pg||
nt|lestergold: I mean his hand is gianormous|pg||
nt|april7: I think 3@S shows 3@S cards!:)|pg||
nt|dima:  Can North think that West psyched 1NT with long clubs in 3rd seat?|pg||
nt|dagold: QJxx xxx xxx xxx|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c9|nt|april7: misunderstanding, S thinks that N has @H probably!|pg||

nt|dagold: Did the auction really go like that or is there some special meaning of a bid we are unaware of|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c4|pg||
nt|dagold: so why did south bid 3s?|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h8|pc|h2|pg||
nt|dima:  But then 3@s is virtually impossible (if S think N has hearts)|pg||
nt|dagold: perhaps 4h was multi purpose in case partner had hearts and diamonds|pg||
nt|lestergold: Kista needs Copey to send in his friends with then white coats|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s7|pc|sQ|pc|s5|pg||

mb|p|nt|kaapo: I don't object to that but I think it would be fair to state that 1NT is usually not 14 in 3rd hand then|pg||
nt|mmmakela: last here, thx kibs,Kaapo, Chick and Staffan for outstanding operator job!|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: thank you, will try to keep myself from commentating though :)|pg||
nt|kaapo: 1@C 2+@C, natural or balanced|pg||

nt|vugraphzpx: not that early, about 7.50am.. :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: only -4|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  with a little bit more @c lay, 5@c could have been better than 7-trumps @s game|pg||
mb|1N|nt|mmmakela: hard to match the OR result here|pg||
nt|kaapo: 1@C 2-way|pg||

mb|p|nt|kaapo: 2@D looks like natural and game forcing|pg||
nt|kaapo: Um, sorry, 1@C may have been strong for EW :)|pg||
mb|2C|nt|kaapo: 1@D either 11-13 NT or unbalanced with a 4-card major; does not promise dimonds|pg||

mb|2N|nt|kaapo: Hmm, have they incorporated transfers into the system?|pg||
nt|kaapo: 2@S might show something like 8-12 here|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: 10-13|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: If he had a long minor instead of a major, it would be a psyche, but 1@H surely was not|pg||

mb|p|nt|othered1: Now, how do Ew apply th ebrakes to the auction?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|joemanjo: needs immediate @d play to beat 4@h.|pg||

nt|mdgraham: 7@C on spade finesse - dubious proposition|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  yes, but if you are on 7th level - you have no choice|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that double can be either for take-out or penalty - let us hope EW play it as take-out |pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: @CA, then find the @D switch |pg||
