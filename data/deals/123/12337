nt|finch:  Surely 4@H by North?|pg||
nt|lml: they would bid the game and induce a defensive erroor if they could|pg||

nt|brolucius: @DJ is suit preference for a spade switch|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: sorry - players chucking cards down so I can't see them!!!|pg||
nt|brolucius: There can be no point in attotude or count, so West quite rightly gives a suit preference signal.|pg||

nt|lml: west was determined not to lose the spade suit again|pg||
nt|finch:  An exclusive 1-level overcall with a good suit in a bad hand, opposite a passed partner, is the best time for a 4-card overcall|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dJ|nt|lml: but ... it keep north south from spades |pg||
nt|finch:  North's 1NT is consistent with their very light opening style|pg||
nt|finch:  It is a fairly horrible 12-count, but if partner is a sound opener it's still worth 2NT|pg||
nt|lml: I dont know its pretty heavy|pg||
pc|d3|nt|brolucius: Yes, if you bid only 1NT on that, the bid must be covering an uncomfortably wide range.|pg||

nt|brolucius: Redouble normally shows a doubleton diamond honour.|pg||
nt|finch:  Another (10)11-13 balanced opening - again, South is not minimum|pg||
mb|r|mb|p|nt|brolucius: With three or more diamonds, East would seek to take away bidding space in one way or another.|pg||
nt|lml: I think most people would open the south hand... maybe everyone|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: redouble normally shows the majors with tolerance for diamonds, which may or may not be what Simpson is doing here|pg||
nt|finch:  Oh yes, but most people would consider it a minimum (although AAK is nice)|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: for example, he would still redouble if @dA were @sA|pg||
nt|brolucius: North has already suggested the major suits.|pg||
pc|c7|nt|dburn: North has suggested one of them - there is no particular reason to suppose that he has both of them|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|pc|c9|pg||
nt|finch:  The NS card is not clear, but many people play this double as showing both majors (with one of them, you bid it)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Many players bid the major, even on four cards, when they hold only one major. A double then promises both.|pg||
nt|lml: I usually play that double shows both but I suppose it doesnt have to|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|c8|pc|c4|pg||
nt|finch:  With no other information, the percentage line in diamonds is to play them from the top|pg||
nt|lml: well east-west didnt get too high|pg||
nt|dburn: since 1@C does not show clubs, it is necessary to be able to double with, say, a 3=3=3=4 11 count without a diamond stop - you cannor raise clubs with such a hand|pg||
pc|c5|pc|d4|pc|cQ|pc|cJ|pg||

pc|d5|pc|d6|pc|dK|pc|cT|pg||
pc|h8|nt|finch:  Some people play transfers over the 1D overcall (x = hearts, 1H = spades, 1S = the unbiddable hand)|pg||
nt|dburn: sure it does, but that is part of the price you pay for a 1@c opening that does not show any clubs (or any points)|pg||

nt|finch:  Declarer knows the @SK is right now as otherwise SOuth would have a 1NT opening|pg||

mb|p|nt|xenya: the 3@C bid could help them to achieve that|pg||
nt|eggy: Presumably Brunner is not allowed to open with2254 shape|pg||
pc|h3|nt|eggy: If he decided to move, I expect their agreement requires preference|pg||
pc|h4|nt|eamongall: can show 5@H and 4@S but who cares when dropping a few 50s on low high card points |pg||

mb|4C|mb|p|nt|brolucius: 4@H now usually denies a singleton by the opener.|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|brolucius: So West makes a splinter bid. |pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|lml: I think that 4@D was his only way to show slam interest|pg||
nt|Walddk6: Is 4@D last train rather than a cue bid I wonder|pg||
nt|finch:  4@D "last train" type - East has very nice trumps so doesn't want to sign off, but has nothing to cue bid|pg||
nt|brolucius: Looks like 4@D is 'last try', not guaranteeing a diamond control.|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|nt|lml: well it all worked and they are on their way|pg||
nt|finch:  4@D is probably technically a cue bid - so West may be expecting AJxxxx of hearts and the @DK instead of his actually dummy|pg||
nt|finch:  But that doesn't hurt|pg||
nt|lml: could they get too high here?|pg||
mb|5N|nt|brolucius: No, you are right. It seems they are going to produce a rather good auction.|pg||
mb|p|mb|6H|mb|p|nt|finch:  Now he's expecting AK of thearts and the @DK, but East will soon put a stop to that|pg||
nt|dburn: dangerous to play "last train" in partner's suit, but no real alternative for East other than, perhaps, a committal 5@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Well done!|pg||
nt|Walddk6: In South England they call it "last try" rather than "train" because the trains can't get all the way because of the snow|pg||
nt|lml: it is a nice auction|pg||
mb|p|pc|sJ|nt|brolucius: Yes, we are iced up here. We absolutely had to make it out to Waitrose this morning because we had run out of such necessities as partridge and fillet steak. |pg||

pc|sA|nt|Walddk6: or Sweden, -44 the other night|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|pg||
nt|brolucius: What do you mean? It was -2C here overnight.|pg||
nt|Walddk6: -44 C that is|pg||
nt|finch:  This is not a trivial play problem, as declarer doesn't know hearts are 2-2 and he needs a 12th trick from somewhere|pg||
nt|brolucius: -40 is the same on both temperature scales if I remember rightly.|pg||
nt|dburn: not actually all that much difference between -44C and -44F, of course|pg||
nt|Walddk6: It is actually|pg||
nt|finch:  One obvious line is to cash the ace of clubs, then organise a diamond ruff or ruffs to dummy|pg||
nt|lml: okoay I concede|pg||
nt|dburn: not straingtforward to organise two club ruffs in the West hand, certainly|pg||
nt|finch:  but this goes off with spades 5-1 and trumps 2-2 (obviously less likely than trumps 3-1, however)|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|pc|c5|pc|c4|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h8|pc|hA|pc|h3|pg||
nt|dburn: in fact, one club ruff will probably suffice, since South will be squeezed in the black suits|pg||

pc|d4|nt|finch:  But why should you play for that layout?|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dJ|pc|d7|pg||
nt|finch:  I hope he remembers not to ruff a diamond with the 2...|pg||
nt|lml: if a sneaky low diamond comes back East needs to be careful|pg||
nt|Walddk6: Well, he has played before, so ....|pg||
nt|dburn: you might feel that it needs either 3-3 spades or the spade length with the @cK - somewhere around the 68% mark, that|pg||
nt|dburn: this line is harder to evaluate|pg||
nt|dburn: or, of course, hearts 2-2, which makes the simple line of drawing three trumps and then ducking a diamond look pretty good|pg||
nt|lml: if north puts east asleep then he might ruff low|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|lml: that is probably his best chance|pg||
nt|Walddk6: I'll call the Scotland Yard if he does|pg||
nt|brolucius: Hanlon began with ace and another diamond against the 4@H contract we saw earlier, allowing declarer to ditch one of her spade losers.|pg||
nt|finch:  I'll buy draw trumps & duck a diamond, because you might decide to play for a double squeeze instead|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|pc|hT|pg||

nt|xenya: N can bid 4@S straight away or 4@C -- jump fit, if available -- would be nice here|pg||
mb|1S|nt|iain sime: 4 Clubs is a good bid- partner will likely be on lead.|pg||
mb|2D|nt|yo_yo: hi everyone|pg||
nt|eamongall: good afternoon Kath |pg||

nt|eggy: Good afternoon everyone|pg||
pc|s6|nt|yo_yo: john & Michelle, england's top mixed pair |pg||

nt|mdgraham: in the last cricket club quiz we went to there was a good one (anagrams of famous people): Vindaloo and rice|pg||
nt|yo_yo: apart from ...... |pg||
pc|h2|pc|hQ|nt|xenya: nicely done by N -- 5@D is cold|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, a spade, a heart and a club to lose -- -200 vs -400|pg||

nt|finch:  David Bird, Linda Lee and David Burn. Thanks also to Sandra Claridge and Bridge Great Britain|pg||
mb|1D|nt|finch:  together with the Scottish Bridge Union (Anne Perkins and Fiona Greenwood).|pg||
mb|1S|nt|finch:  Thanks in particular to the vugraph operator, Norma Bain and to Roland Wald & BBO.|pg||
mb|p|nt|finch:  We start again at 17:35 GMT, or in about 45 minutes time.|pg||
mb|2D|mb|d|mb|2S|mb|3H|nt|brolucius: 2@S may show a better hand than a pass would have done.|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: The tempo of this auction is different from that at the other table. No chance of N/S going to 4@S over 4@H here, even if West bids it.|pg||

pc|dA|nt|brolucius: So, a heavy portion of IMPs flow back to CBAI on the last board. A bit unlucky for England, but they have been lucky on other boards. A close result was fair.|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d9|pc|d7|pg||
pc|d3|nt|finch:  There is nothing really wrong with 4@H as a contract; the 4-0 break is unfriendly|pg||

pc|h4|pc|h3|pc|hK|pc|s7|pg||
nt|brolucius: Exactly|pg||

nt|brolucius: 3@D, when East opened a weak 2@D at this table, went only one down instead of three down at the other table, bringing the scores to 40-40. And a big 13 on this one. Oh dear. |pg||

nt|mdgraham: they might get to game there, at the other table|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2H!|an|NF|nt|eggy: but best to defend from either side, given the layout I think|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|mdgraham: South has a good hand, but it's a bit quacky|pg||
nt|eggy: West has great potential opposite the "right" heart hand, but this isn't it|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@H coming?|pg||
nt|eggy: He may be more ambitious than that I suppose|pg||
mb|4H|nt|eamongall: holland has no  reason not to pass |pg||
mb|4S|nt|eggy: North may phantom here, although i don't thinks it's right|pg||
nt|eamongall: oops|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|nt|mdgraham: double coming|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|iain sime: 3C is obviously a 4 card raise.|pg||
nt|eamongall: but West is going to be disappointed to see @HAK not scoring even 1 trick |pg||
nt|eamongall: still enough for 1 off at least |pg||
nt|mdgraham: he won't worry - they'll be getting plenty more|pg||
pc|d9|nt|yo_yo: what else would Holland do?  Void in opps suit and partner showed good support|pg||
nt|eggy: Not that unhappy once he discovers that N only holds 5 spades i think|pg||
nt|eamongall: 2 off on that lead |pg||
nt|eamongall: thats without GIB button by the way|pg||
nt|eggy: well done Eamon |pg||
nt|mdgraham: this would be better if South had had four trumps|pg||
nt|eamongall: 4@Hs will be off a few on trump leads |pg||
pc|d7|pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dQ|nt|eamongall: but probably off 1 in reality as who leads trumps frm @HQTxx|pg||
pc|s6|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|eamongall: we won't see this board result until end of other room ..in 2 hours time |pg||
pc|h2|pc|hT|nt|xenya: yes, and E opened a bit light vulnerable -- that might have helped NS reach 4@S|pg||

nt|yo_yo: He partnered also the late great John Armstrong |pg||
nt|mdgraham: Brian Callaghan thinks 4@H makes from the short side|pg||

nt|yo_yo: well that's science fiction|pg||
nt|eamongall: Jim (flash) Gordon indicates "early-morning cross-eyedness possible, but doesn't 4@H make on any lead but a trump?   (win pointed-suit lead in dummy and lead a @C up; use @H AK to ...|pg||
