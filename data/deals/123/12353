mb|p|mb|1D!|mb|1S|nt|Walddk2: 1@D  0-7|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I have Crouch's 181 pages of notes in front of me|pg||
nt|chessmaste: I have a note from the milkman in front of me|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|dagold: Opposite a 1 spade overcall when 1@c  was not strong 1nt would be reasonable. Not now|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|dagold: A good way to play after a 1@h/1@s over call of a strong @c is that 1nt is a good raise|pg||
nt|dburn: Patterson may have intended to rebid 1NT rather than 2@c, which is why he passed over 1@s, but this is somewhat dangerous|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Give North or South West's @H A and they would have a game, so South is right to do something|pg||
nt|dburn: 2@h may be a Rubens-like transfer response, so that South is treating his cards as a spade raise|pg||
nt|dagold: and North is making a game try|pg||
nt|dagold: rather than raising hearts. South did not overcall 1@h after all|pg||
mb|p|nt|chessmaste: I imagine a direct 1@H would be conventional|pg||
nt|dagold: As a strong @c player would you rebid 1nt over 1@s on Patterson's hand David?|pg||
nt|dburn: the Murdoch-Spears card says that responses to overcalls are "transfers from the cue bid", but of course South does not have a cue bid available|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Norma Bain is some operator. She is at both tables at a time according to the profiles|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: well, pass effectively shows a minimum 1NT rebid|pg||
nt|chessmaste: A twin sister perhaps?|pg||
nt|dagold: I see|pg||
pc|c8|nt|dagold: I guess Spears thinks he may have improved the contract|pg||
nt|dburn: but I would be inclined to bid 2@c anyway, minimum and all|pg||
nt|dagold: a bit of a gamble in my view|pg||
nt|dagold: sure I like 2@c|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cK|pc|c2|pg||

mb|p|nt|garnetts: West must pass here  |pg||

mb|p|nt|roswolf: sorry for the shout but the keyboard is frozen|pg||
mb|p|nt|eamongall: this is the weaker side of the Carrot @C |pg||
nt|eggy: I think East was playing n for a pretty thin raise as well|pg||
nt|eamongall: holland will hardly move in |pg||
nt|eggy: Although Holland rarely declines invitations|pg||
nt|garnetts: I can hardly imagine Victor Goldberg letting 3@S go |pg||
nt|roswolf: yes n/s seem to have put their head into the noose|pg||

nt|garnetts: He was a tough handful at the table |pg||
pc|c2|pc|c9|pc|c6|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks -1 at least|pg||
nt|jackthelad: all seems pretty reasonable, and cant really be more than -1|pg||
nt|garnetts: True  but quite a lucky lie for NS --unenamoured of the 2@S bid and the 3@S bid too|pg||
nt|jackthelad: difference between Victor and Brian is rubber...Victor played stakes, Brian never did|pg||
nt|garnetts: strikes me that if East ha s bid and west reversed that partner has a poor overcall --maybe 2@S initially |pg||
pc|dT|nt|xenya: perhaps winning the Ace followed by a @S back would have been better|pg||
pc|d4|nt|roswolf: fair point|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C!|nt|dagold: three strong @cs in a row|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Crouch treating his hand as 16+. Fair enough|pg||
mb|1D|mb|d|nt|dburn: well, if East-West are going to open a strong club onevery board, we might be able to work out what their system is by the end of the set|pg||
nt|dagold: Double is some kind of balanced positive?|pg||
mb|2D|nt|Walddk2: I can e-mail the 181 pages if you like|pg||
mb|3S|nt|dburn: although in truth, anyone who can work out a Crouch system on the basis of fewer than, say, 16000 boards is doing pretty well|pg||
mb|p|nt|chessmaste: Does that count towards your carbon footprint?|pg||
mb|4D|nt|dagold: Wouldn't mind actually, anything Crouch has come up with is worth looking at|pg||
nt|dagold: I prefer 3@d on souths hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|dagold: don't see the point in 2@d|pg||

nt|dburn: not clear which of the horrible slams is least horrible - maybe 6@c|pg||
nt|chessmaste: But will North support him?|pg||
nt|dagold: not sure why that changes things Roland. Partner says, I have 4 cards in hearts|pg||
nt|dagold: does that mean he must not have values of use elswhere?|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Indeed, but as South you would have liked a 1@S response better|pg||
nt|dagold: 3nt call in my view is good judgement|pg||
nt|dagold: I don't think it makes as much difference as you think Roland|pg||
nt|dagold: partner bids 1@h with 4-4 in the majors|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, but 1@S will often be 5+ cards if you don't play Walsh|pg||
nt|Walddk2: After 1@C opening|pg||
nt|dburn: not sure about 3NT - partner probably ought to pass that with a singleton spade, and that's not what you want him to do|pg||
nt|capercliff: you have then wrong sided a likely contract?|pg||
nt|capercliff: sry:)|pg||
nt|dagold: I have been asked why I think 3nt is good judgement|pg||
nt|dagold: For me it is not ideal but|pg||
nt|dagold: I think it is a fair description of the hand. 8-10 majors stopped|pg||
nt|dburn: oh, it's the right idea to bid notrump rather than support diamonds, but would prefer @sAQx and @hKJ8x, not the other way about|pg||
nt|dagold: raising diamonds does not exactly seem ideal either|pg||
nt|dagold: I agree David|pg||
nt|dagold: I just think that 3nt is a practical and sensible call|pg||
nt|dagold: i think 3@d should have more playability or diamonds|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn: here, one might bid 2@s and then 3NT to suggest some level of concern|pg||
pc|h5|nt|chessmaste: From memory 3NT is described as 9+ in the Acol Index|pg||

nt|eamongall: Most decent pairs these days have a relay to 3NT in their auctions to gateway to minor suit stuff |pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|eggy: A dreadful 3NT, but may be hard to stop out of|pg||
nt|Walddk7: This may help N-S to avoid the doomed 3NT|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|Walddk7: No|pg||
nt|mdgraham: or it may not....|pg||
mb|p|nt|eggy: especially now , unless that denied a stop and was therefore a misbid|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: 2@D looks like asptro|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it makes sense to use your normal defence to an opening Multi 2@D against this kind of overcall|pg||
pc|s4|nt|eggy: or transfer|pg||
nt|mdgraham: (assuming it is one major, not Astro or some variant)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|jackthelad: 2@c is probably stronger than 2@s, so result could be the same|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|pg||
nt|garnetts: ood isn't EW can make 3NT |pg||
nt|henryb: What do you think, Panel. Does 3@s show extras, or just a minimum with four trumps?|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cQ|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
nt|yo_yo: @S and another|pg||
nt|garnetts: Minimum for me--start with a double with a decent hand or cue one of there suits |pg||
pc|d3|pc|dK|pc|dA|nt|iain sime: After the cue bid, East was always bidding game, but gave himself a chance to reach  a 4/4 heart fit.|pg||

nt|roswolf: nice diamond suit blocked|pg||
nt|garnetts: How hard was it to play the Q@D?  |pg||
pc|d4|nt|eggy: might be any of those - or both majors (Capp)|pg||
pc|dT|nt|roswolf: impossible it looks like|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|xenya: might need careful defence to beat it though|pg||
nt|iain sime: trump best.|pg||
nt|jackthelad: why I think the 2@s in the other room was better....at least gave a chance of missing it...also loosing trick count in E is ugly|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, we're guessing a bit, aren't we?|pg||
nt|garnetts: I was thinking he might do that |pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|vugraphzgk: small delay due to a bathroom break|pg||
nt|iain sime: Wales in the other room have done well to flatten Board 15 where 5@S was a save at adverse vulnerability.|pg||

nt|Walddk7: And not needed as all CCs are available|pg||
nt|garnetts: Poor west will be looking for a hole now |pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|Walddk2: 2@C would have been game-forcing with clubs or 9-11 with three spades, so Murdoch had to settle for 1NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c5|nt|dagold: best lead|pg||
nt|bigtrain: have to disagree... no reason not to play supportX in ANY system other than if playing weak NT|pg||
nt|bigtrain: you at at a huge disadvantage if competitive auctions if R can't differaniate the trump fit|pg||
nt|dburn: sure, partner's life is easier if when you support you are supposed to have four cards|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|nt|bigtrain: but obviously i agree IF you're playing weak NT...  then support X is wrong|pg||
nt|dburn: but when you don't support (and double instead) partner often ends up with no idea what to do|pg||

mb|2H|mb|p|nt|garnetts: I think on the last hand the Q@D was right not because partner might have 7 but because it might allow some fluidity between the defenders hands |pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk7: 3@D is a good contract for N-S; 3NT is not, too much to do|pg||

nt|eggy: I thought that you supported Scotland|pg||
pc|d3|nt|jackthelad: double dummy and bad def can actually make...but little chance in reality|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Is it double dummy to win the ace and pitch a club on @HK?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Then cross-ruff your way to 10 tricks|pg||
nt|iain sime: @CA, @HK and cross ruff the next six, keeping @SAQ|pg||
nt|Walddk4: declarer may think that if W has @cK, E must have @dA for his opening, as Michael Rosenberg points out. That is true|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Michael: crossruff might fail if E has 4-card @D|pg||
pc|d9|pg||

pc|s6|pc|sQ|pc|h4|pc|s5|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Spears did what Michael thought he might. No success on this layout|pg||
nt|vugraphzgk: declarer had AC pulled out before putting it back and playing QC|pg||
pc|hK|nt|jackthelad: you have to read the @d position and the @c even in the X ruff..so still a tad double dummy :)|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h3|nt|eggy: West should play a spade after the club I think, to cater for the HJ in South's hand|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|hT|pc|h2|pc|h7|pg||
