nt|jafa: so -540 is a slightly odd datum|pg||
nt|jafa: nice opportunity for n/s to brew up some imps and bring the scores back to level|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: yes, my eye slipped.  Datum is +990|pg||
nt|susanjane: 990 is datum |pg||
mb|p|nt|wesleyc: yeah i was going to say|pg||
nt|jafa: 990 makes more sense|pg||
mb|6N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jafa: so one imp to the south aussies for their 6NT|pg||
nt|jafa: unless they duck a diamond lead or something|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: So, current scoreline is 56.3 to 77 and that shouldn't change by more than 1 IMP here|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cA|pc|c7|pc|c3|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cJ|pc|c6|pc|c2|pg||
mc|13|nt|jafa: so 19.7 imps to Adam and Andy going into the final segment of 16|pg||
nt|jafa: the current odds on betfair have Adam and Andy as 1.35 favourites|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: yes I think that is right. Betfair lol|pg||
nt|susanjane: are they playing on or having a break?|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: Looks like we'll be having about a 10 minute break before going into the final set of 16 boards.|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: Love the 48 boards straight through head to head :D|pg||
nt|vugrapha1: So Hung - Edgtton lead 77 to 57.3 going into the last set.  Back in 10 to 15 mins|pg||
