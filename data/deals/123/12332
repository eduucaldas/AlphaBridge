nt|vugraphzer: I will post the last results from closed room soon|pg||

nt|athene: this is a hand from the previous set|pg||
nt|cliveo: As there is no play in progress it might be interesting to reflect on what has happened so far, I thought Holland and Brunner who are representing England for the third successive ...|pg||
nt|cliveo: year were on top form in defence last night|pg||
nt|po-s: Who is leading this event?|pg||

pc|s7|pc|sK|nt|athene: club lead looks much more natural from east's hand|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s5|pg||

nt|kdr_fm: good chance west might wack this as a 2 way shot ... 5M makes and 5@C is -1|pg||
nt|athene: using the @SAK @HA to get the long suit going|pg||
nt|athene: now declarer might be able to come to two spades, two hearts, two diamonds, three clubs|pg||
pc|c2|nt|rodal f: EW are brothers wich have played many years together in 1st and 2nd div. so they will land|pg||

nt|Vugraphzgj: Director giving table into trouble for talking through the screen|pg||
nt|ady: west may open a weak 2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and a good solid one it is too|pg||
nt|ady: north has no definate action|pg||
mb|p|nt|kdr_fm: 3@H N/s makes so 2@s is a good result in the open|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|athene: a pretty definite pass i think :)|pg||
mb|2H!|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: NS play 2M as 8-11, with 2@D reserved for weaker (0-7!) hands|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: likely to fail by 1 trick |pg||
nt|athene: double is just about vaguely possible from south|pg||
mb|p|nt|kdr_fm: Having said that 3@h vul is alot of bidding on the N/S cards|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|nt|mcarroll: 4@S is also a lot of bidding on the cards|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|athene: the question here is whether declarer can build a diamond trick for a black-suit pitch|pg||
nt|ady: might  make on this lead  |pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|c2|nt|kdr_fm: right well .... this should be 5 imps or so to scotland|pg||
nt|athene: could put the @D8 in but playing low worked out ok anyway|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cJ|nt|rodal f: Normaly waisted @SK. Then 6@Hand 11HP at N in vul, but....|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|nt|hedyg: are you suggesting that N should pass?|pg||
pc|cT|nt|athene: i remember billy eisenberg's bridge tip was to play low in dummy even with nothing in hand - third hand won't know to take a deep finesse against dummy and it often lets you build ...|pg||
nt|athene: a trick from nothing|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|cliveo: a difficult hand for Holland to lead from|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c7|pc|cK|pc|h4|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d9|nt|chick: coming in at the 3 level is pretty brave|pg||

nt|rodal f: He is 2 times pair champ so now:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: i would bid|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dA|pg||

pc|c3|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt looks a bit much|pg||

pc|c8|pc|c4|pc|cQ|pc|c7|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ady: what did the 1NT rebid show?|pg||
pc|cT|nt|athene: he must have thought 1nt was strong, surely|pg||
nt|mdgraham: presumably putting a lot of value on the @HK |pg||
nt|cliveo: their convention card says 1NT opener is 15-17|pg||
pc|h4|pc|c9|pg||
pc|c2|pc|d4|nt|ady: then west was maximum for rebid  and still down 2|pg||

nt|golfsquash: falling apart now :)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: C!J continuation rather than @S would have helped the scramble|pg||

mb|1D!|mb|p|nt|roswolf: the east hand is my typical rubber bridge holding|pg||
mb|1H|nt|odysseus69: slam time?|pg||
nt|brolucius: E/W play strong 1@C, with the usual 1@D to cover various weak hands.|pg||
mb|1S|mb|d|nt|roswolf: a typical tactical bid by east|pg||
nt|brolucius: Patterson has freedom to respond because he knows that N/S must have game values.|pg||
nt|roswolf: support double|pg||
nt|odysseus69: difficult to reach what is around 50% slam|pg||
nt|roswolf: rdbl may be good here|pg||
nt|odysseus69: support double promising 3 hearts|pg||
nt|brolucius: Redouble looks OK, whatever it means.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Usually values and a doubleton honor in spades.|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|pc|dQ|nt|brolucius: Declarer has one diamond discard on the @CA and must hope to build another on the hearts (to make 12 tricks).|pg||

mb|1C|nt|ady: easy game for n/s   |pg||
nt|athene: not a great 6@S here but it does make|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: marginal 6@S, nothing special |pg||
mb|p|nt|golfsquash: a chance here to recoup some Imps|pg||
nt|athene: if they don't lead @HA or a club you probably end up having to find the @HJ|pg||
nt|mdgraham: @HJ coming down in three rounds is handy|pg||
nt|athene: although there are various ways you can fiddle around|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and there is also a two-way finesse for it |pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|athene: maybe you ruff some hearts and/or clubs and then run trumps and hope for a squeeze if no big cards fell|pg||
nt|ady: unlikely to get beyond game|pg||
nt|athene: i seriously doubt they will play anywhere other than 4@S|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|kdr_fm: yup scrambled lots a tricks there ... just dont agree with 2@C in teams .. maybe not vul its ok but 400 out ...|pg||
nt|athene: hmmm...2@C might get south interested|pg||
nt|cliveo: If they bid it I would expect them to make it|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|athene: the problem with doubling on hands like south's is when it goes double all pass and the penalty is insufficient|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|kdr_fm: this works @Hk onside 620 in|pg||
nt|cliveo: What would you bid then?|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|athene: if you don't want to just bid 4@S on these hands, then play something funky like 4@C overcall is a "strong" 4major bid|pg||
nt|mdgraham: there is also the possibility that there may not be any penalty at all  |pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|pc|dA|pg||

nt|golfsquash: The bidding is also a clue|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|athene: if you lead the @HK and west wins and switches there will be a double squeeze around hearts|pg||

mb|p|nt|roswolf: well a possible slam which i think e/w will do well to avoid|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|odysseus69: this time a Roland slaam - it can make with a little look at Norths cards|pg||

nt|odysseus69: I sent it to you David|pg||
mb|3H!|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Normal bidding would be 2@H (transfer) followed by forcing-to-game 3@D.|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|odysseus69: 3H probably retransfer - now 4D|pg||
mb|3N!|nt|odysseus69: 3NT- serious slam try - possibly|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, but you are forgetting that my system sends messages from you straight to the spam box.|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Even if East's @SJ were the @SQ, a club lead would still put the slam in jeopardy.|pg||

nt|cliveo: I wonder what the difference was between 2 @S and 4 @S by Brunner|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 4@S logically has to be very long spades and hence a really big hand not to have just bid them first time|pg||

nt|mdgraham: this could get interesting now|pg||

mb|4D|nt|Vugraphzgj: after confering with E, N changes his mind, +1 |pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|athene: the problem now is west still doesn't know if they have a club control|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 4@S denies a heart control, by the looks of it - but can 5@C be so far wrong? |pg||
