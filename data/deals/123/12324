nt|benjent: We know he should play a diamond, but that may be letting declarer's @c loser go|pg||
nt|imp_jan: excactly|pg||
nt|imp_jan: on the other hand, west migth have cashed in @CK first|pg||
nt|benjent: Not clear that West would have cashed @cK when he was in, so Muller can't be sure of the layout|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1H!|mb|p|nt|andersk: Looks like we have 14 board to come here!|pg||
nt|burry1975: final this year as expected between the White house and 't Onstein|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|burry1975: the two semi professional teams in the Netherlands|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|andersk: When I saw the line up, I kinda digured that this is "the match" of the championship|pg||
pc|s7|nt|burry1975: at this table Brink - Drijver who play together for a number of years now and had a lot of good results since|pg||
nt|andersk: that was a great lead from East|pg||
nt|burry1975: jansma paulissen only play together for two years now. This year they won the butler in the RR i believe|pg||
nt|andersk: Probably only lead to set this contract|pg||
nt|burry1975: i think they were both members of the junior team that won the world championships in 87|pg||
nt|andersk: looks like MUD lead for me|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Yes excellent lead, attacks declarer's entries while the diamonds are blocked|pg||
nt|andersk: MUD is Medium Up Down, this is to show partner that lead was from weak 3 card suit|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  On any other lead, declarer can concede a diamond and reach the good diamonds with the @sA|pg||
nt|andersk: next card will be @S 9 then @S 3|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: Drijver just asked about the leads. Paulissen explained 2nd 4th from any holding, but from eg KJT(xx) the J. "Very old-fashioned"|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|pc|s4|pg||
nt|andersk: maybe thay will start plying MUD now|pg||
nt|andersk: :9|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|d3|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: EW play upside-down count and attitude|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hQ|pc|hA|nt|andersk: When you see the layout here! Normally they win 1 NT, defenders "almost never" finds the holding in every suit|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
pc|s9|nt|burry1975: with hearts 3 3 this can make now if declarer guesses right|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|pc|sA|pg||
pc|h7|nt|andersk: well played|pg||
nt|burry1975: yes probably the best line and still leaves option open to run the diamonds|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  The defenders winning the first diamond means they probably are not breaking|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I think he will still need to guess clubs to make|pg||

mb|4C!|an|misbid|mb|p|nt|benjent: 4@c is a strong relay|pg||

pc|d6|pc|d4|nt|jeanhari: Verhees thinking to go up and playing for the club ruff but he must make three tricks so it wasnt a good plan|pg||
pc|h4|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|jeanhari: declr must choose between clubs 3-2 and heart finesse, so I suppose he will go wrong|pg||
nt|imp_jan: strange discard: that low heart by verhees|pg||
nt|po-s: It seems to be the standard card from Dutch elite players|pg||
pc|c2|nt|benjent: If De Wijs tries to ruff 2 spades, he'll need to take the @h finesse (or get trapped on the board late), so I think he will take a different line|pg||
nt|benjent: And he does :)|pg||
nt|imp_jan: declarer realises that when trumps dont break, clubs might not do that either|pg||
nt|jeanhari: good play|pg||
nt|benjent: The @h pitch may have turned him off the @h finesse idea|pg||

nt|jeanhari: @HQ will show up after discard :)|pg||
nt|imp_jan: or might he finesse the hearts like jansma did|pg||
nt|jeanhari: north did not bid over 1nt so most of the time only 5@S |pg||
nt|jeanhari: so he can play north for 4@H|pg||
nt|vugraphzbu: they have 11 minutes left, so they will surely be late here|pg||
nt|jeanhari: can take some time|pg||
nt|benjent: next set is in about 40 minutes, I think ... will they finish in time? :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzbu: West asks about the defence against 1N opening, they play 2@C=both M, 2@D=1M, 2M=5M-4m, and after "weak 1N"they play solid style|pg||
nt|imp_jan: now the interesting point is: suppose south had originally 3 small hearts, wld he ever have pitched one of those?|pg||

mb|1D!|nt|imp_jan: Hans Melchers, the boss of Onstein, stated that he will replace one of the pairs if they perform badly in the finals, so far no reason i guees|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzbu: but Ton and Huub were here already at 10 in the morning..|pg||

mb|2H|mb|p|nt|imp_jan: well then they are on time for lunch :)|pg||
mb|3H|nt|jeanhari: indeed they will play with three pairs, but Brink Drijver and Muller de WIjs as base team|pg||

mb|4S|mb|p|nt|po-s: a bit unlucky|pg||
nt|imp_jan: agree p.o.|pg||
nt|imp_jan: only heart stopper, not silly to end up in the 5-2 fit|pg||
nt|vugraphzbu: 4@S on a @H lead never looks really good, does it?|pg||
nt|jeanhari: no, indeed bad luck for Ricco v Prooijen choosing not to bid 3NT|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|vugraphzbu: might end here now..|pg||
nt|jeanhari: maybe any further bidding is no bad luck :)|pg||
nt|imp_jan: wow, last makeable contract: 4n|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|nt|imp_jan: spades dont break , but clubs do|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|nt|imp_jan: not over yet|pg||
nt|jeanhari: just key card, so must be rated as a misunderstanding or misbidding somehow|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|nt|imp_jan: Ultimate Club is getting out of hand|pg||
nt|benjent: Now it's going to get expensive ...|pg||
nt|imp_jan: very|pg||
nt|po-s: if spades break there is a reasonable chance to make, but if the heart bidder has the CA 3NT rates to go down unleaa there is a doubleton QJ of diamonds|pg||
nt|vugraphzbu: Muller wll be wondering if they are really planning to play 6@D|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|imp_jan: these guys shld resally look deeply in thr methods, bidding like this on 26 hcp with no clear fit is weird|pg||

pc|hT|pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|d2|pg||
nt|burry1975: ten of hearts doesnt indicate a club entry so brink thinking whether he can trust this. However even with spades breaking only 8 tricks so he needs to play clubs|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|pc|c8|pc|c2|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: Brink's X of 5@C gained 9 IMPs; OR played 5@D-2|pg||

mb|1D!|mb|1H|nt|imp_jan: both teams stuffed with members of Team Orange, the selection of the Dutch open bridge team |pg||
mb|1S!|an|0-3!S|mb|p|nt|benjent: I guess Muller & de Wijs are playing their Tarzan Precision. What are NS playing?|pg||
nt|imp_jan: not able to answer all yr questions, quite a few coming in already|pg||
nt|vugraphzbu: NS play precision with canape|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h2|nt|vugraphzbu: EW lead attitude against NT|pg||
nt|imp_jan: NS play Ultmate Club (desigend by Ekeblad and Rubin)|pg||
nt|imp_jan: 1@d opening usually is 12-14 hcp bal, but has diff meanings as well|pg||
nt|vugraphzbu: Het Witte huis got a 17 Imp Carry-over from the round robin, they won it by a big margin|pg||
nt|benjent: Verhees would like to play the @h9 just looking at the @h suit, but if it wins, it places him in the wrong hand to play @d's, which is what he would like to do next|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h8|pc|hK|pg||

pc|d9|pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|c9|nt|benjent: And Verhees doesn't know for sure the @d suit has worked yet, so he's going to be a little nervous about how much 1NT is going to cost him|pg||

mb|2C!|an|6!C or 5!S-4!C 10-15|mb|p|nt|imp_jan: 6c interesting|pg||
nt|benjent: I wonder what doubling 1S would have meant by East?|pg||

mb|2D!|an|Relay|mb|p|mb|2H!|an|6!C|mb|p|mb|2N!|an|asks|mb|p|nt|imp_jan: btw white house play with 2 pairs throughout( vProoijen-Verhees and Jansma-Paulissen)|pg||
mb|3C|an|7+!C|mb|p|nt|imp_jan: Onstein has 3 pairs (Bakkeren-Bertens are sitting out for the moment)|pg||
mb|3D!|an|asks|mb|p|mb|3N!|an|short !S|mb|p|nt|benjent: It's not a very heavy playing schedule, so I think playing 4-handed is actually an advantage|pg||
mb|4H!|an|!C is trumps|mb|p|nt|benjent: Pretty small advantage though :)|pg||
mb|5D!|an|2kc without queen+max|mb|p|nt|benjent: So I'm guessing South has shown his exact shape and keycards ... and perhaps expressed a maximum as well|pg||
nt|imp_jan: so it will end in 6@c|pg||
nt|benjent: North is still thinking, so he must be wondering if 6NT could be safer|pg||
nt|imp_jan: hard to imagine with his stiff diamond (he bid nt first)|pg||
nt|benjent: He would like to find out if partner has both red K's|pg||
nt|benjent: Even then, there's no guarantee 6NT is better ... or even making, so I think he'll eventually settle for 6@c|pg||
nt|imp_jan: people are asking me about the methods of NS, hopefully somebody can mail me info on Ultimate Club|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|imp_jan: once more, i i get a lot of questions by the spectators, imposs to answer most of them|pg||

nt|imp_jan: a link: http://www.bridgewithdan.com/systems/Ultimate.zip|pg||
pc|s2|nt|benjent: Simple line is to play East for one of the 2 black K's|pg||
nt|imp_jan: but not sure if this is the appropriate version (verhees and van prooijen adjusted a lot)|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|s9|pg||

pc|c2|pc|c5|pc|d2|nt|imp_jan: after winning @SA declarer looks favorite to win the slam indeed|pg||
