nt|imp_jan: correct now|pg||
nt|Vugraph814: Muller didn't open 2@S, he's declaring the contract however, but I didn't get the auction|pg||
nt|daman: probably a transfer response by W|pg||
nt|imp_jan: probably east had opened 1n (12-15) and after xfer they play 2@S|pg||

pc|d5|pc|dK|pc|d7|pg||
nt|daman: definitely|pg||
nt|imp_jan: not a hand WH is waiting for|pg||
nt|Vugraph814: TD has been called|pg||

nt|daman: this hand will not help either|pg||
nt|daman: flat|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C!|mb|2C|mb|d!|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|imp_jan: Sorry have to take that back, Brink-Drijver are playing|pg||
nt|imp_jan: Bakkeren-Bertens are out|pg||
nt|daman: 3@C X could go for 800|pg||
nt|daman: but I guess they are trying to stir the pot|pg||
nt|imp_jan: it is often good practice to interfere lwith 2@c vs strong club|pg||
nt|Vugraph814: Yesterday Brink told me: "I hope it's still exciting who's going to win tomorrow. Correction: Either we should be far ahead or it should be exciting"|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c4|nt|imp_jan: west treated his hand (with those tens) as a 16-18 nt|pg||
nt|daman: Rubin/Becker   with their famous relay system     had problems with a 2@C overcall as well|pg||
nt|daman: it was the one flaw in their system|pg||
nt|daman: Muller will not have to work hard on this hand as long as he ducks a @C|pg||
nt|imp_jan: declarer is looking for 9  tricks|pg||
nt|daman: he is forced to play S for the @S Ace    no?|pg||
nt|imp_jan: and decl does not expect that @SA is in South|pg||
nt|daman: no, but he has no choice really|pg||
nt|imp_jan: might take some time|pg||
nt|daman: muller is known to take his time|pg||
nt|imp_jan: diff hand (not will all crds open of cours) and Bauke Muller is at the wheel|pg||

nt|burry1975: war and peace:-)|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok|pg||
nt|sybarra: that makes more sense  |pg||
nt|jeanhari: easy 4@S, NS missing diamond control|pg||
nt|sybarra: and not only game on the @D  ruff|pg||
nt|xenya: so just 1 off undoubled -- could be a swing |pg||
nt|xenya: what a freak|pg||
mb|2H|nt|burry1975: in which the White House eliminated all|pg||
nt|sybarra: I suspect the TD has spoken about "lets pick up the pace boys" |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|xenya: hard to predict where all that will end|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  If 4@c is a two suiter, North can probably just bid 5@h now|pg||
mb|d!|nt|xenya: nice|pg||
mb|p|nt|burry1975: 4 hearts look playable here|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - friendly @C break helps|pg||
nt|xenya: i tend to agree|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Maybe South will bid again though|pg||
mb|3S|nt|nigel_k:  The other table is playing board 1 now so we should start to see comparisons|pg||
nt|burry1975: interesting detail is that de wijs muller played the round robin in a different team (onstein 2)|pg||
mb|p|nt|burry1975: but they were promoted to the first squad after that |pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: "I have a very "suited" hand for you p", Jansma said|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: "Void again, huh", Paulissen said|pg||
nt|jeanhari: S will make a move now|pg||
nt|xenya: N might leave the double in?|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: no -- well done|pg||
mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  I think North has quite good cards for offence opposite a red two suiter and no certain defence|pg||
nt|xenya: hopefully we'll have no more breakdowns|pg||
nt|rnmalik: hope so:)|pg||
nt|xenya: good stop|pg||
nt|vugraphzbt: should be fine now :)|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c2|nt|sybarra: and a likely @D  lead will pick up that suit and so it is |pg||
nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
pc|cA|nt|rnmalik: 2@H DBL was also profitable for NS|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|xenya: but the game is just on a finesse|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hA|pc|h6|pc|h2|pg||

nt|sharkey: hope Bas can keep up :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: Barely|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: The slower they play the harder, you have to be focused without having anything to do|pg||
nt|xenya: 4-0 trump split is a nuisance but can be overcome|pg||
pc|s6|nt|xenya: 6@C would have been a correct save here|pg||
pc|sT|nt|sharkey: think you jinxed him Frank |pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|s4|nt|burry1975: 5s X on board 2 is duplicated in the open room|pg||
pc|d7|pc|s8|pc|sA|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hT|pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||

nt|po-s: unless North gets to bid diamonds|pg||
nt|vugraphzbt: Bakkeren claimed when Jansma was wondering what to do|pg||
mb|1C|an| |mb|p|nt|sybarra: here comes a club sequence... |pg||
nt|burry1975: open room was in 3nt here, west doubled and now ns are in 4clubs|pg||
nt|sybarra: Jan may bid 4 @S |pg||
nt|sybarra: quickly get in the way |pg||
nt|sharkey: not sure at these colors|pg||
mb|1H|nt|nigel_k:  I'm not sure what South's double was as the clubs were unlikely to ever run and he had some cards in partner's suits|pg||
mb|p|nt|burry1975: true, you need to play SAPP to bid that one:-)|pg||
nt|sybarra: Jan is white,  why should he wait?|pg||
nt|sybarra: 1 @S= 1n?|pg||
nt|jeanhari: can make 5@D or NT here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: One note for the last board, 5@D is a good save against 2@S :)|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Maybe just hoping to win trick one and play a major through West|pg||
mb|1N|an| |mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  Yes much harder by North and 6@d instead of 5NT is possible|pg||
nt|jeanhari: 5@D more probably to reach|pg||
nt|jeanhari: :)|pg||
nt|xenya: trap hand for NS|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|jeanhari: that was too fast for my typing|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: 3 NT may be not an option anymore - doesnt mind defending minor suit|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Not sure what sort of hand 3NT indicates in their methods but it doesn't look that attractive with 4405 shape and understandably hard for South to pass|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|nigel_k:  They may still be ok in 4NT or 5@c if they can stop|pg||
mb|p|nt|jeanhari: is was vulnerable|pg||
nt|sybarra: we may just see a claim |pg||
mb|2S|nt|Vugraphzbt: LOL, Bertens shuffled, said 600 and everyone agreed|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: Didn't even show his cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: 3 NT is an option....|pg||
nt|xenya: 6@C is excellent, looking at NS's hands|pg||
mb|p|nt|burry1975: 3nt is highly likely made due to the friendly heart position|pg||
nt|sharkey: indeed|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: on a good day, you might even make 7|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  After the 1@h overcall it still isn't bad but I don't know if I'd want to be there|pg||
nt|xenya: and it looks like 6@C can be made here despite the 5-0 trump split|pg||
pc|sT|nt|sharkey: doesnt have enough transportation i think|pg||
nt|xenya: it looks like a very good 4@S -- i wonder what stopped them from reaching it|pg||
pc|sA|nt|sybarra: I dont think he can do it |pg||
nt|burry1975: just enough...as long as you dare to begin with the ace of hearts|pg||
nt|sharkey: have to pick up @C suit as well|pg||
nt|sybarra: another "all in" move imo |pg||
pc|s3|nt|sharkey: may be double dummy|pg||
nt|burry1975: yes first the 2 of clubs, then finesse clubs and then ace of hearts|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|burry1975: but like i said... you need to have a crystal bowl:-)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: agree now @S on the table and @D finesse|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d7|pc|dT|nt|sharkey: is he able to cash @HA - 9th trick?|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|d8|nt|xenya: 6N by S is hopeless though|pg||
nt|xenya: oh it's by N...|pg||
pc|d3|nt|sharkey: sry - disregard|pg||
nt|burry1975: the moment of truth coming up|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|vugraphzbt: 5@h = 2|pg||
nt|xenya: still hopeless|pg||
nt|vugraphzbt: pass on 5@hx = undiscussed|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|sybarra: wd |pg||
nt|rnmalik: with that lead they are playing to maintain it but lose a vul game|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s8|nt|sharkey: E has shown M so has to play for stiff Honor|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  It looks like South expected North to have a balanced hand, or he would not have insisted on diamonds|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like NS have failed to handle this properly -- landing in a 7-0 fit instead of 5-3|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, Nigel, most likely |pg||
nt|nigel_k:  It isn't going to get better no matter how long he keeps staring at the cards|pg||
nt|xenya: even if @Cs came in, declarer wouldn't have 12 tricks unless there's something good in @Ds |pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s4|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sharkey: wd|pg||
nt|burry1975: so a good double by bakkeren in the open room|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s9|pc|cT|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h5|nt|xenya: no doubt he counted on 5 club tricks and was looking for a way to make|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h2|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|xenya: now he knows there's no chance|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  is there a time monitor at the table?|pg||
nt|vugraphzbt: yes|pg||
nt|xenya: this might be a huge swing|pg||
pc|c2|nt|vugraphzbt: Bertens is trying to make Paulissen faster|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d9|pg||
nt|xenya: well it's far from cold, looking at the NS's hands, but vulnerable it's a fair proposition |pg||

nt|burry1975: scared them out of 3n|pg||

mb|p|nt|Vugraphzbt: TD just announced 45 minutes for 7 boards left, telling them to speed up a little|pg||

nt|Vugraphzbt: Too much to relay|pg||

pc|hA|nt|nigel_k:  Should East or West have done more here?|pg||

nt|rnmalik: +1|pg||
nt|jeanhari: nice bidding|pg||
nt|rnmalik: no 4@C|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Hi Henry|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb: an unusual and successful play|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 7 should not be bid-finesse is involved in both the suits|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzbt: Drijver explains bidding to van Prooijen|pg||
mb|p|nt|burry1975: ten of hearts doesnt indicate a club entry so brink thinking whether he can trust this. However even with spades breaking only 8 tricks so he needs to play clubs|pg||
nt|rnmalik: we know that it makes because of stiff Q@H|pg||
nt|xenya: with all due respect, 7@H is against the odds|pg||
pc|c2|nt|imp_jan: hier komt nog een 4@H overheen|pg||
nt|imp_jan: oops|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sharkey: EW shut out in OR|pg||
nt|sharkey: the @H suit|pg||
nt|burry1975: so the white house strikes back with 45 unanswered Imps in the last five boards|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Maybe this set will never end|pg||
nt|burry1975: I think the white house likes that thought|pg||
nt|burry1975: this set can't last long enough:-)|pg||
nt|sharkey: good defence by NS - forcing with repeated @D leads|pg||
nt|burry1975: good effort but wont be good enough.. |pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: Classic NE trump holdings|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cK|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: Brink's X of 5@C gained 9 IMPs; OR played 5@D-2|pg||
pc|h9|nt|nigel_k:  Yes, he can't make if West has @cA anyway|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Running the nine of clubs would be ideal but the entries aren't there to do it safely|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|pc|h3|pc|d2|pg||
nt|burry1975: same defense. South trowing a heart and declarer playing jack of hearts. They copy the play |pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h6|mc|13|pg||
qx|c13|st||md|3SKQT93HA64DK5CAQ3,SA85HJ87DA983CT86,SJ62H532DQT62CK72,S74HKQT9DJ74CJ954|sv|b|nt|sharkey: but it worked|pg||
nt|burry1975: true, can't argue with success|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk1: The 3rd set was scheduled to start 5 minutes ago|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|sybarra: will they get both hands in |pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|burry1975: 4h can be set. In the open room verhees however could make it on a stripsqueeze|pg||
nt|sybarra: come back by the White House team impressiver here,  will be great next set! |pg||
nt|burry1975: however he misread the ending so still ended up down one|pg||
nt|sharkey: What is 1! opening?|pg||
nt|burry1975: for whose interested please check the playing records for this board and the three card ending|pg||
nt|sharkey: 1@D|pg||
nt|sybarra: remember they play a (tarzan) @C system |pg||
mb|p|pc|c6|nt|rnmalik: Board 8 NS lost 11 imps|pg||
nt|jeanhari: good partscore , will it make?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Vugraphzbt: Grace time is over now as well|pg||
nt|xenya: @H lead would beat 3N, but it's rightsided here -- as in the other room|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|burry1975: ew should be able to cash their spades at a certain point. so this should lead to down 1|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: 5 minutes of grace time just commenced|pg||
nt|sybarra: although I am surprised he didnt bid 1 @H |pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|nt|sharkey: ty Shirley - so cud be down to 0?|pg||
nt|sybarra: Many thanks, to our excellent operator Bas....no clue if I will have time later to say  @H@H|pg||
nt|sharkey: May be shud have been 1@H opening and 2@D showing good raise?|pg||
nt|burry1975: bas, did bauke really open 1d?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: Yup, as far as I could see|pg||
nt|sybarra: Thanks also to my co commentators Carl and Frank.   We appreciate your time, insights and humor.   |pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: Thanks Shirley, it was my pleasure :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: We may have another bd  but who knows?|pg||
nt|burry1975: thanks all|pg||
nt|sharkey: are we already done?|pg||
nt|sharkey: thanks all|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: Nope, 28 too|pg||
nt|burry1975: well with bauke declaring this may take some more time|pg||
nt|sybarra: we may have another bd,  if they get to play it |pg||
nt|sharkey: we may have another ½ hour to go yet....|pg||
nt|sybarra: and we have another session today |pg||
nt|Walddk1: They don't take boards away in Europe. That's an ACBL thing|pg||
nt|Walddk1: They penalise them for violating time|pg||
nt|sybarra: that is better R |pg||
nt|sharkey: last board cud be a swing board too|pg||
nt|sybarra: you must be peaking |pg||
nt|sharkey: while you wait HedyG has been kind enuff to supply a link to their respective systems:|pg||
nt|burry1975: a spade looks tempting however if the ace of spades is onside declarer expects a club ruff|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: Actually Roland, apparently the players received an e-mail saying that no time penalties would be issued, but boards cancelled|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: Or so I was told by Sjoert Brink|pg||
nt|sharkey: http://www.ecatsbridge.org/documents/files/ConventionCards/2008MindSportGamesBeijing/Open/Netherlands/muller-dewijs.pdf|pg||
nt|Walddk1: I see, but that has not happened|pg||
nt|sharkey: system for Muller - de Wijs|pg||
nt|burry1975: and will only make then with hearts 3-2 and the 3 card heart suit ruffing|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: Indeed|pg||
nt|Walddk1: I now hear that this only applies if they can't play all boards due to weather conditions|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: Looking outside; more snow is piling up, with increased winds|pg||
nt|sharkey: we assume S opened 1@H|pg||
nt|burry1975: well in that case they can play segment 4, 5 and 6 aswell today|pg||
nt|sharkey: Has anyone checked if Muller's awake?|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Muller is just going through all 8,321 combinations|pg||
pc|d2|nt|sybarra: maybe he is staring out window a the snow |pg||
nt|henryb: this could have been defeated by a heart or a club lead, but the automatic spade is declarer's eighth trick and the club is the ninth|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|rnmalik: should be made|pg||
nt|rnmalik: How 4@S was missed in the OR|pg||
nt|rnmalik: with @H lead it will go off-but should be bid|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c7|pc|c5|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Yes, North is easily strong enough for 2NT|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s5|nt|burry1975: spade lead is asked for now, else we have the same stripsqueeze|pg||
nt|burry1975: I will confess....i won't find that|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|nt|sybarra: or a spec suggested S is playing "Sominex coup"  (Put opps to sleep) |pg||
nt|Walddk1: Was too tough to find the spade switch|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s7|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h2|nt|Walddk1: Muller must have a pretty good feeling about the location of @SA|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  The defense discarded the setting trick but now diamonds are blocked so still down I think|pg||
pc|sK|nt|nigel_k:  He could have afforded @d8 instead of @d5|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: The grace time has ended|pg||
pc|s8|nt|nigel_k:  As spectators point out, if West cashes the heart declarer can discard a diamond |pg||
pc|sJ|pc|c4|pg||
pc|sT|nt|jeanhari: exciting day, both teams not able to keep the score below 100 in 42 boards|pg||
pc|cT|pc|h3|pc|c9|pg||
pc|d5|nt|nigel_k:  But West wisely declines the invitation to do so|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dT|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|hK|nt|burry1975: still one imp to WH so they double up their imps this session|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h7|pc|h5|pg||

nt|jeanhari: ok, 17 imps caary over but still more then 2 imp's a board|pg||
nt|rnmalik: last board here I think|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|sybarra: thx again to all names above,  and esp. thx to specs for your comments and humour |pg||
mb|2C|nt|sybarra: multi= weak with 1 major|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: We're 15 minutes out of grace time already|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|burry1975: a game for NS to end with, this shouldnt take that long|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: last board of this segment I think|pg||
mb|d|an| |nt|vugraphzbt: last board of this segment|pg||
nt|henryb: notice in the other room that South took a preference to partner's second suit|pg||
nt|xenya: yes|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|burry1975: 3nt by N?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: Yup Rahed|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: *Rashed|pg||
nt|jeanhari: yes, tx all for watching|pg||
nt|jeanhari: tx to Bas for excellent operating word|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: Thanks all, we'll be back tomorrow @@ 4:30 AM NY time, 10:30 Paris AM time and 8:30 PM Sydney, I think|pg||
nt|vugraphzbt: we should restart at 13.00|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: oh oh |pg||
nt|burry1975: well, tarzan not build for this probably|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: Thanks Jean, my pleasure as always :)|pg||
nt|jeanhari: probably come to Utrecht tomorrow, see you there|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Thanks Jean and Bas|pg||
nt|xenya: thanks everyone -- it was an interesting set|pg||
mb|p|pc|dT|nt|nigel_k:  This is a pretty good slam in clubs - basically on one of two finesses|pg||
pc|d8|nt|henryb: that is he anticipated that North could have four hearts and five clubs|pg||
pc|d2|nt|burry1975: 2d is probably a relay after which 3S shows a splinter|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|jeanhari: oeps, Huub Bertens going for a score!|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: See you tomorrow then, if I get there tomorrow morning :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Scores are level now, thanks Jean and Bas-entertaining|pg||
nt|jeanhari: finding the cards lying well for his partner|pg||
pc|cT|nt|sybarra: aha  better!|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: Oops, sorry!|pg||
nt|burry1975: that looks more normal indeed|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: Well, I already got my compliments ;)|pg||
nt|burry1975: sorry simon for thinking you actually passed!|pg||
nt|sharkey: you keep us on our toes Bas :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 2 correct finesses:)|pg||
nt|jeanhari: I think all will be decided in the last set tomorrow|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cJ|pc|c5|pg||
nt|burry1975: now three overtricks|pg||
nt|jeanhari: EW open getting the hearts wrong with the Bxx  opp. H9xxx|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jeanhari: so 12 imps to Onstein|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I don't know if I would double 1@s with South but it looks better than the balancing double|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  And certainly worked out better|pg||
nt|henryb: I think North might have bid 2N over the balancin double, showing two places to play, but he certainly would have corrected 3@d to 3@h|pg||
nt|xenya: how did EW manage to stop in 2N on a combined 28 count?|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hJ|nt|xenya: in the iother room|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|burry1975: pretty good i'd say but missed by drink drijver which is also not unreasonable|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: And another 11 on this board?|pg||
nt|jeanhari: declarer doesnt know but cant go wrong here|pg||
nt|jeanhari: indeed|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I agree|pg||
nt|henryb: 3@c making 130 was a spectacular result in the other room|pg||
pc|c3|nt|burry1975: the Q?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sharkey: shud try @C first|pg||
pc|c8|nt|burry1975: 11 imps back to the WH so it's tight match. The carry over is won back by 't onstein so it looks like a long exciting weekend in Utrecht|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hA|nt|xenya: in 1NT|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h5|pg||
nt|burry1975: the ten looked 100%|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: Thanks all, we'll continue tomorrow|pg||
pc|dA|nt|burry1975: which is good considering we are stuck inside with the freezing cold outside:-)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: Long for sure, already 15 minutes late...|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Some of us are enjoying summer though|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: :)|pg||
nt|henryb: This will drift off down 1|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d3|pc|d9|pg||
mc|11|nt|rnmalik: the lead has also reduced to 25 imps|pg||
nt|vugraphzbt: we're supposed to restart at 15.15, see you then!|pg||
