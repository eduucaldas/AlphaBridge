mb|p|nt|andersk: When I saw the line up, I kinda digured that this is "the match" of the championship|pg||
mb|4S|nt|burry1975: at this table Brink - Drijver who play together for a number of years now and had a lot of good results since|pg||
nt|andersk: that was a great lead from East|pg||
nt|burry1975: jansma paulissen only play together for two years now. This year they won the butler in the RR i believe|pg||
nt|andersk: Probably only lead to set this contract|pg||
nt|burry1975: i think they were both members of the junior team that won the world championships in 87|pg||
nt|andersk: looks like MUD lead for me|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Yes excellent lead, attacks declarer's entries while the diamonds are blocked|pg||
nt|andersk: MUD is Medium Up Down, this is to show partner that lead was from weak 3 card suit|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  On any other lead, declarer can concede a diamond and reach the good diamonds with the @sA|pg||
nt|andersk: next card will be @S 9 then @S 3|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: Drijver just asked about the leads. Paulissen explained 2nd 4th from any holding, but from eg KJT(xx) the J. "Very old-fashioned"|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|nt|sharkey: assume 1 NT = 12-14?|pg||

mb|p|nt|Vugraphzbt: EW play upside-down count and attitude|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|h4|nt|andersk: When you see the layout here! Normally they win 1 NT, defenders "almost never" finds the holding in every suit|pg||

pc|s2|nt|andersk: well played|pg||
nt|burry1975: yes probably the best line and still leaves option open to run the diamonds|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  The defenders winning the first diamond means they probably are not breaking|pg||

mb|p|pc|d5|nt|burry1975: 2d probably a non minimum heart raise|pg||
nt|andersk: The question is if Jansma will let them play 5@D, probably since he hold 3 small @H and alot too defense with|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dQ|nt|andersk: wow|pg||

nt|andersk: If 2 @D is a @H raise, I cant see how Jansma can get away from 6@S|pg||

nt|nigel_k:  I thought I had done well to avoid Muller's table |pg||
nt|burry1975: difficult decision for drijver here. Odds on he will bid|pg||

pc|s3|pc|s6|pc|sJ|pc|s8|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h5|nt|nigel_k:  Good decision by North. Many players would have passed 3NT but the bad spade suit is actually more suited to 4@s spades than 3NT.|pg||

nt|benjent: One of the upsides of Xing 3NT is that they may run when the tight game is actually coming home|pg||
nt|benjent: Having dislodged them from a game, he should really resist the temptation to double them back into one. The mathematics are entirely different|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sharkey: 3 NT is an option....|pg||
pc|s2|nt|burry1975: 3nt is highly likely made due to the friendly heart position|pg||

pc|cK|pc|c8|pc|c7|nt|burry1975: ten of hearts doesnt indicate a club entry so brink thinking whether he can trust this. However even with spades breaking only 8 tricks so he needs to play clubs|pg||

nt|burry1975: a spade looks tempting however if the ace of spades is onside declarer expects a club ruff|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: Actually Roland, apparently the players received an e-mail saying that no time penalties would be issued, but boards cancelled|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: Or so I was told by Sjoert Brink|pg||

nt|Walddk1: I see, but that has not happened|pg||
nt|sharkey: system for Muller - de Wijs|pg||
nt|burry1975: and will only make then with hearts 3-2 and the 3 card heart suit ruffing|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: Indeed|pg||
nt|Walddk1: I now hear that this only applies if they can't play all boards due to weather conditions|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: Looking outside; more snow is piling up, with increased winds|pg||

nt|burry1975: well in that case they can play segment 4, 5 and 6 aswell today|pg||
