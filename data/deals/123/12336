nt|athene: 4@S wouldn't have been fun for NS - west was just waiting to get his hands on that one|pg||
mb|1H|nt|james_h: Lets see if NS help/push EW to slam?|pg||
mb|p|nt|james_h: Tom Hanlon takes matters into his own hands|pg||
nt|james_h: Given this start,I think south will definately sac in 6@s ... lets see|pg||
nt|mcarroll: How many @S from Hugh? 4 I guess|pg||
mb|3H|nt|mdgraham: Hamman in his book castigated the jack-denies lead method. |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ..and hi William|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: Reckoned it gave declarer more help than it was worth |pg||
nt|chick: how high will NS go in @Ds?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: As ever with these thngs, the truth is somewhere near the middle|pg||
nt|chick: looks like 4 is the limit|pg||
nt|frankaus: this action quite a contrast to th OR|pg||
nt|vugraphzgh: PC technical problem with the CR NIBU NI match|pg||
nt|mdgraham: an enterprising 1@S overcall |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mcarroll: And James is right if EW bid 6 they will find the save|pg||
nt|andyv:  this one will take some work|pg||
pc|cT|nt|athene: normal enough to reach 4major when you have a 5-4 fit and some shape|pg||
nt|andyv:  and some help which the @c lead does provide|pg||
nt|athene: but south's values aren't exactly where north wants them|pg||
pc|c2|nt|frankaus: 3NT here would be my choice aswell|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mdgraham: duck a diamond|pg||
nt|james_h: whos buying?|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d7|nt|frankaus: 10 quickly|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mcarroll: OK - me|pg||
nt|james_h: Martin is a great team player|pg||
nt|athene: east had better jump in with the @DA and switch to a spad|pg||
nt|athene: spade|pg||
nt|andyv:  difficult hand to declare... when N goes after @ds, the @s switch will be obvious|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|andyv:  but E seems to be unaware of the danger to the hand|pg||
nt|athene: well it's very hard for east - he doesn't know anything about declarer's hand|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: needed to win diamond ace first time really..|pg||
nt|andyv:  but he does know he has no tricks in @ds and @cs... @s suit is only hope|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't think winning A of @d was all that difficult|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|pc|h2|pc|d6|pg||

pc|c7|pc|h4|pc|c8|pg||

nt|mcarroll: Hi Frank|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c9|pc|s4|nt|frankaus: 11 now & may take @H fin for 12|pg||
nt|chick: wish I knew what 3@H meant .. might be a clue to whether to finesse @Hs or not|pg||
nt|mdgraham: high card raise to 3@S, I suspect|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|james_h: North needs to establish @d because he cant draw t and ruff, 3@c and 1@h|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cK|nt|wilkinsona: best of fortune re exams..|pg||
nt|athene: even if you know that declarer has a singleton diamond, it might sometimes be right to duck - give declarer @SAxx for instance|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.camrosebridge.com/  for a website with lots of useful information|pg||
nt|athene: now rising the ace gives him pitches for both spades but if you duck he loses no diamond but two spades|pg||
nt|athene: but i agree it might have ben findable if east remembers his side needs FOUR tricks to beat this|pg||
nt|andyv:  as long as this isn't match points, rising with A of @d and switching to K of @s was called for. |pg||
pc|h5|nt|frankaus: Value raise of @S would be my guess|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dJ|pc|hT|nt|chick: could it show something in hearts besides?|pg||
nt|frankaus: even 13 now on @H finn|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|c4|pc|c2|pg||
nt|rodal f: :)|pg||
nt|athene: you can be a lot more aggressive with hands like east's if you know it's a 4-4 fit|pg||
nt|andyv:  3 chances to make... slim, fat and none|pg||
nt|athene: maybe he expected 2@H to guarantee a 4th trump|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c6|pc|c8|pc|c5|pg||
nt|andyv:  some use 2N (this time it would be by E) to find out what quality of raise partner gave them... it would have helped this time|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yes E has assumed 4 hearts, and I think at least 3 diamonds and added a bit more as well|pg||
nt|athene: north has quite a lot of defensive cards not to double this|pg||
nt|athene: but his partner is a passed hand and he doesn't have any distributional surprises|pg||
nt|andyv:  but, E was a bit optomistic....2@h was already too high|pg||
nt|athene: and no-one forced east to bid game!|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sA|pc|s5|nt|mdgraham: well, whether South runs or not depends on your parameters for doubling 1NT   |pg||

pc|d5|nt|frankaus: on repeated trump leads this can fail|pg||
pc|d9|nt|james_h: I dont believe South has shown his clubs naturally, he may have implied them|pg||
nt|rodal f: Should be implied now so 4@C to come?|pg||
nt|james_h: the fact the 3h is not alerted makes me think its just natural|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|vugraphzgh: Late alert of 3H|pg||

nt|james_h: sorry Rodal, this it too tame for me|pg||
nt|james_h: I demand more "fast lane" hands|pg||
nt|mcarroll: but this time the @S save is too expensive|pg||

nt|po-s: and 7clubs more|pg||
nt|rodal f: 1700 might enough|pg||
nt|james_h: West is considering her options|pg||
nt|po-s: right, I counted 6 spade tricks, forgot the ruff|pg||
nt|andyv:  no reason for W to fly with the Ace|pg||
nt|athene: if his partner has the @HA there's no rush anyway|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk5: How are you going to bid a grand slam with any accuracy when opps bid spades like mad as happened in the other matches?|pg||
nt|james_h: opening 1@c with this hand when looking at the NS (terrifying animals :) ) may not be appealing|pg||

mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|james_h: clubs|pg||
nt|rodal f: By exlution blackwood EW should have a easy line til 7|pg||

mb|p|nt|rodal f: P??|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Is 2@C really a limited opening? I mean, after all she has a 3 loser hand. Impossible to catch up later I predict. I agree with PO|pg||

nt|po-s: now South|pg||
nt|james_h: I'm sure|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mcarroll: Good Pass|pg||
nt|andyv:  10 tricks will fall on S's lap|pg||
nt|andyv:  anyone here like not leading pd's suit?|pg||
nt|athene: it's sensible to not lead partner's suit if you have one of your own|pg||
nt|athene: but eschewing the spade lead with a doubleton, just for KQx, seems a bit weird|pg||
nt|andyv:  i agree|pg||
pc|d4|nt|frankaus: @H and this may suceed|pg||
nt|james_h: South must smell a rat as he likes to balance|pg||
pc|d6|nt|chick: E has an interesting problem here .... N didn't choose NT without a good stopper in @Hs|pg||
nt|chick: so is one of his black suits better chance to set?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that's a lead declarer didn't want to see  |pg||
nt|james_h: this is an EW implosion|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: may concern declarer though..|pg||
nt|andyv:  rule of 6 should have told declarer not to hold up|pg||
pc|dK|nt|wilkinsona: yep, spade now gives south some losing options...|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mdgraham: not sure of the EW system here....2@D either a straightforward Multi (so to speak) or possibly a bad-suit weak two|pg||

pc|hK|nt|po-s: Probably there was a West face when Pass came back|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Well, the crux of the matter is that the West hand is too good for 2@C|pg||
nt|james_h: lol PO|pg||
nt|andyv:  I wonder why W is so reluctant to lead pd's suit|pg||

pc|c3|pc|c4|pc|cT|pc|c5|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Here is a very interesting hand|pg||
mb|2N|nt|Walddk2: With all cards in view it is easy to make 6@H, but it's not obvious at the table|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Colin Simpson of England made it against Ireland just now|pg||
nt|capercliff: well easy enough to make it at the table perhaps, but not to bid|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3nt probably shows a bal hand and minimum|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|roswolf: east will not be enthused|pg||
mb|p|nt|capercliff: W has such good controls, they wont stop before slam|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 1@D   1@H      4@C (splinter)  4@D  (last train)|pg||
nt|roswolf: after east passes it actually may be easier|pg||
nt|capercliff: if West could find the AK@h and K@d he may bid the grand even|pg||

mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5H|nt|andyv:  I imagine E tried to ruff a @d low|pg||

nt|athene: there was a hand in a set earlier this morning where declarer had something like @S63 in dummy and ruffing with the @S6 stopped an overruff|pg||

mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: well, asks about the grand|pg||
mb|7H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: perhaps there was a misunderstanding about the nature of 6@H here|pg||
nt|athene: east thought 5NT was asking for specific kings so 6@H denied one|pg||
nt|athene: and west thought 6@H showed two side kings|pg||

nt|athene: if that isn't the case, west was just illogical - why not bid 7@H over 5?|pg||

mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: east here being more conservative|pg||

nt|vugraphzgh: Discussing system Burns McGann|pg||
nt|athene: hard to say how high it will go..maybe just a gentle 3 of something|pg||
nt|athene: 2@H is presumably non-forcing ("negative free bid")|pg||
nt|athene: if it's forcing he is short of a few big cards :)|pg||

mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|nt|vugraphzgh: That is how it was explained to South|pg||
mb|5H|nt|mdgraham: 2@C inverted?|pg||
nt|frankaus: nicely rightsided|pg||
nt|vugraphzgh: Hi |pg||
nt|james_h: This is a battle between a 2 wal club NS and a 1 way club EW|pg||
nt|james_h: way|pg||
nt|andyv:  if EW are playing precision, dbl of 2S should have shown max for the bidding but hardly inviting E to keep bidding|pg||
mb|d|nt|andyv:  agree|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|james_h: Nice work by NS here, 2NT a good raise, 3d a trial bid (I expect)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: well, if East leads back a heart....question is, could the lead be from KJ10|pg||
nt|frankaus: will they find the killing defence?|pg||

pc|cK|pc|c6|pc|d3|nt|athene: east would have been better-off to bid a weak jump shift 3@H over 1@S|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cJ|nt|mcarroll: Second borderline 4@S in a row for Hanlon Mcgann - just the type of situation in which they thrive|pg||
