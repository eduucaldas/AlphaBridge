nt|roghog: Perhaps the last hand shows why for Brink-Drijver. Aggression in the auction + clinical card-play |pg||

nt|Vugraphzbt: Such coincidence :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: Gd morning|pg||
nt|sybarra: gm Carl  welcome |pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: It seems we'll have to restart the broadcast in order to correct the score. We apologize for the inconvenience|pg||
nt|Walddk8: score incorrect, pls shut down|pg||
nt|sybarra: we had an exciting last set  W.H  took the lead |pg||
mb|1N|mb|d|nt|andersk: Looks like we have 14 board to come here!|pg||
nt|burry1975: final this year as expected between the White house and 't Onstein|pg||
nt|sybarra: better! |pg||
nt|rnmalik: I was a kib some fantastic play:)|pg||
mb|2D|nt|sybarra: re score |pg||
mb|p|nt|burry1975: the two semi professional teams in the Netherlands|pg||
nt|sybarra: toughest 4 players perhaps in the other room |pg||
mb|2H|nt|sybarra: n/s play Tarzan club |pg||
nt|sybarra: assuming we have same pair |pg||
mb|3D|nt|andersk: When I saw the line up, I kinda digured that this is "the match" of the championship|pg||
mb|d|nt|burry1975: at this table Brink - Drijver who play together for a number of years now and had a lot of good results since|pg||
nt|andersk: that was a great lead from East|pg||
nt|burry1975: jansma paulissen only play together for two years now. This year they won the butler in the RR i believe|pg||
nt|andersk: Probably only lead to set this contract|pg||
nt|burry1975: i think they were both members of the junior team that won the world championships in 87|pg||
nt|andersk: looks like MUD lead for me|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Yes excellent lead, attacks declarer's entries while the diamonds are blocked|pg||
nt|andersk: MUD is Medium Up Down, this is to show partner that lead was from weak 3 card suit|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  On any other lead, declarer can concede a diamond and reach the good diamonds with the @sA|pg||
nt|andersk: next card will be @S 9 then @S 3|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: Drijver just asked about the leads. Paulissen explained 2nd 4th from any holding, but from eg KJT(xx) the J. "Very old-fashioned"|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: delayed this segment by 45 minutes|pg||
nt|sybarra: Brink/Drijver v Jansma/Paulssen      |pg||
mb|4H|nt|sharkey: assume 1 NT = 12-14?|pg||
mb|p|nt|andersk: maybe thay will start plying MUD now|pg||
nt|andersk: :9|pg||
nt|sybarra: but our guys are no slouches!|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rnmalik: tough contract would need some play|pg||
nt|sybarra: *Paulissen.....sorry |pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Hi everyone|pg||
pc|dK|nt|sybarra: yes think that range, it is a club system  |pg||
pc|d8|nt|Vugraphzbt: EW play upside-down count and attitude|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|pg||
pc|dA|nt|andersk: When you see the layout here! Normally they win 1 NT, defenders "almost never" finds the holding in every suit|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dJ|nt|burry1975: with hearts 3 3 this can make now if declarer guesses right|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Welcome to Jean Harings|pg||
nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s3|nt|sybarra: named Tarzan Club as result of their names....wijs/muller sounding much like the name of the guy (Weismuller) who starred in the old Tarzan movies|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: Hi Jean :)|pg||
nt|jeanhari: hi.. way away for a minute, cooking dinner|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Jean |pg||
nt|rnmalik: Welcome|pg||
nt|jeanhari: I think the players persuaded Hans to play 2 sets each the first day|pg||
nt|sybarra: do tell us what is for dinner?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|andersk: well played|pg||
nt|burry1975: yes probably the best line and still leaves option open to run the diamonds|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  The defenders winning the first diamond means they probably are not breaking|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I think he will still need to guess clubs to make|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: Brink just remarked they've been playing the first board for 12 minutes now|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|sharkey: you go back a few years Shirley :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: 11 tricks - no more no less here|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  There looks to be two trump losers but an endplay may be possible|pg||
nt|xenya: endplay? i don't think so|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  It's an entry short - after discarding a spade on the fourth club and ruffing a spade is in the wrong hand|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  If he was then able to lead the last club from North and ruff it he would make the last two tricks|pg||
nt|xenya: true|pg||
nt|vugraphzbt: dbl on 1nt and 2@d were alerted|pg||

nt|jeanhari: spaghetti Tetrazzini by Jamie Oliver|pg||
nt|jeanhari: but to the bridge now...|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|burry1975: ew can make 5 spades, NS can bid up to 5D which is only down 1|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|andersk: No entrances in East, so 10 tricks in @H for NS, and 11 EW in @S|pg||
mb|2H|nt|jeanhari: I think indeed the level of play wasn"t that good in the second set|pg||
nt|xenya: another hand to play in partscore rather than game|pg||
mb|d|nt|burry1975: 2d probably a non minimum heart raise|pg||
nt|andersk: The question is if Jansma will let them play 5@D, probably since he hold 3 small @H and alot too defense with|pg||
nt|jeanhari: some questionable defense and declarerplay|pg||
nt|sybarra: we have seen better |pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|andersk: wow|pg||
nt|burry1975: the double fit made it 'easy' for paulissen|pg||
nt|andersk: If 2 @D is a @H raise, I cant see how Jansma can get away from 6@S|pg||
nt|burry1975: 6d would put some pressure on it. and costs only 2 imps, will brink do it?|pg||
mb|3H|nt|jeanhari: proves how difficult the game is|pg||
mb|p|nt|burry1975: dbl here shows I want to bid 6D|pg||
nt|andersk: we are 26 mintes in the set, they have played 1 NT = and now bidding board 2, this will be a long day :)|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I thought I had done well to avoid Muller's table |pg||
nt|burry1975: difficult decision for drijver here. Odds on he will bid|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: Actually, they've only completed one board there too :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: @S lead best for NS while N still has @HK as entry|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|sK|nt|burry1975: wrong bet :-)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: Paulissen just requested the TD to come to the table|pg||
nt|sybarra: easy to see from here about the spade lead not so easy at the table perhaps |pg||
nt|sybarra: if I lead AK and a @S  usually it is opp who has 5 @S |pg||
pc|s8|nt|sharkey: usually what happens to me...|pg||

nt|andersk: Im just happy that the previous board was easy to declear:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: Remarkable how (semi-)professional players don't flinch at a board like this, but the worse the players get, the worse their reaction to such a result|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: TD has been called by Paulissen again|pg||
nt|jeanhari: I think line of play in pairs depends on position in a tournament,  do you want to gamble|pg||
nt|jeanhari: nice 6 of a major here|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: now what? |pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: The playing speed :)|pg||

nt|jeanhari: 5@C - 5@H - 6@S ?|pg||

nt|jeanhari: or @H|pg||
mb|3H|an|*|nt|burry1975: 4s for NS here, this should be a quick one too|pg||

nt|jeanhari: well done by Bertens, Verhees is gonna regret bidding on|pg||
nt|jeanhari: indeed|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: Wow, N can almost count to a profitable save, white vs red...|pg||
nt|sybarra: N doesnt know about the clubs |pg||
nt|xenya: 4@H for NS and a @D save EW -- but the bidding didn't go that way|pg||
pc|hK|nt|sybarra: pard kept him in the dark |pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: Bertens just asked me to change the auction :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: Then apologized and said he thought about 7|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  So North didn't realize that 4@h is making and he needed to double 4@s|pg||
pc|h6|nt|sybarra: unlikely this hand will be played at lightening speed|pg||
nt|sharkey: This cud make with the fiendly @D break I think|pg||
nt|sharkey: N has several options|pg||
pc|h5|nt|Vugraphzbt: (According to the TD there wasn't a problem)|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|xenya: double would be dangerous i think|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  If South had a typical @hAQxxxx and nothing else, the double would be wrong probably|pg||
nt|xenya: N couldn't rely on S to have 2 tricks  |pg||
pc|s2|nt|sybarra: not sure that @D break is all that friendly however nice of E not to have another club|pg||
nt|sybarra: Bas,  what venue are you play at?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: NBB office|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Maybe a 1@h opening would have worked out better|pg||
pc|s9|nt|jeanhari: indeed was a very lazy 4@S-bid |pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sharkey: Have to decide on which red suit|pg||
pc|h2|pc|sT|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|sybarra: now making pard feel better and just making 6 |pg||
nt|xenya: and the double might give the show away -- i mean the trump position|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|Vugraphzbt: This was my bad, I must've entered it wrong because S actually bid 5@C...|pg||
pc|s4|pc|h4|nt|nigel_k:  Good decision by North. Many players would have passed 3NT but the bad spade suit is actually more suited to 4@s spades than 3NT.|pg||
nt|sharkey: de Wijs knows W wud duck with @HA|pg||
nt|sharkey: @H9 first time...|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|sharkey: cant see him going down now|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d6|pc|dT|pg||

nt|sharkey: so much easier with all hands in view :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: I assume N placed W with the @DA in view his overcall thus @DQ shudnt cost|pg||
nt|sharkey: Kib questioning whether Paulissen called TD for slow play.....|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: Yes he did|pg||
nt|burry1975: he did indeed. and quite frankly he doesnt mind taking some time as well|pg||
nt|sharkey: now he's in the tank|pg||

nt|burry1975: true....just for the fun of it.. as he is normally the one being called on|pg||

nt|burry1975: war and peace:-)|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok|pg||
nt|sybarra: that makes more sense  |pg||
nt|jeanhari: easy 4@S, NS missing diamond control|pg||
nt|sybarra: and not only game on the @D  ruff|pg||
nt|xenya: so just 1 off undoubled -- could be a swing |pg||
nt|xenya: what a freak|pg||
mb|3C|nt|burry1975: in which the White House eliminated all|pg||
nt|sybarra: I suspect the TD has spoken about "lets pick up the pace boys" |pg||
mb|4C!|mb|4S|nt|xenya: hard to predict where all that will end|pg||

mb|d|nt|nigel_k:  The other table is playing board 1 now so we should start to see comparisons|pg||
nt|burry1975: interesting detail is that de wijs muller played the round robin in a different team (onstein 2)|pg||
mb|p|nt|burry1975: but they were promoted to the first squad after that |pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: "I have a very "suited" hand for you p", Jansma said|pg||

nt|burry1975: they may be pushed there ...|pg||
nt|po-s: 7D on spade lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: I don't know what the TD has said, it all took place outside of the play room. However, Paulissen has bid 2@S|pg||
nt|burry1975: de wijs duly agreed with 1D:-) now they should try to get 3n in his hand|pg||
nt|burry1975: only down with club lead I think|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  At the other table on board 17 South did open 1@h and they doubled 4@s for 300 and 6 imps|pg||
mb|d!|nt|sybarra: 2 @C=  weak with @D |pg||
nt|sybarra: (or stong)  but we know better|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 4@H makeable?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|burry1975: indeed 7 on a spade lead, 3d on a club lead|pg||
nt|burry1975: heart is probably good enough too.... |pg||

mb|4D!|mb|4N|nt|sybarra: someone may X this |pg||
nt|xenya: and they are going to get to 4|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: the only winning defence against 4@H is 3 rounds of spades -- unlikely to be found|pg||
nt|xenya: i may be wrong, sorry |pg||
nt|nigel_k:  West now choosing between 4NT and 5@d|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  5@d will be easier as North is endplayed even if you get clubs wrong|pg||
nt|xenya: yes|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  In 4NT the spade finesse is the tenth trick but declarer may not wish to play for that|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzbt: @C lead not unlikely by W|pg||
mb|p|pc|cQ|nt|sharkey: W's 4@C rather aggressive I think - @S lead called for|pg||
nt|xenya: that would be definitely against the odds -- but is there another chance|pg||
pc|c5|nt|sharkey: not easy from Qxx|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure @S lead with qxx comes to mind |pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry for the echo |pg||
nt|sharkey: If E has the guts to risk @C finesse...|pg||
nt|burry1975: if he has...he can make|pg||
nt|sharkey: think off 1|pg||
nt|sybarra: club finesses and he can...."all in"  as they say in poker |pg||
nt|sharkey: indxeed|pg||
nt|sharkey: ruff 2 @D and 2 @S losers|pg||
nt|sharkey: plus 2 red losers|pg||
nt|burry1975: use the 4th club to draw trumps|pg||
nt|sybarra: well we probably have time to get coffee while he thinks |pg||
nt|sybarra: brb|pg||
nt|sharkey: may be dinner too...|pg||

nt|boedhy: but he knowes @c arent 3-2....|pg||

nt|boedhy: so cannt really set up the @d....|pg||
nt|boedhy: gib says 1 off ok then it is.... will be happy to see at the end that 1 off will win 3imps...|pg||

nt|sybarra: quickly get in the way |pg||
nt|sharkey: not sure at these colors|pg||
mb|2C!|an|!ds|nt|nigel_k:  I'm not sure what South's double was as the clubs were unlikely to ever run and he had some cards in partner's suits|pg||
mb|p|nt|burry1975: true, you need to play SAPP to bid that one:-)|pg||
nt|sybarra: Jan is white,  why should he wait?|pg||
nt|sybarra: 1 @S= 1n?|pg||
nt|jeanhari: can make 5@D or NT here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: One note for the last board, 5@D is a good save against 2@S :)|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Maybe just hoping to win trick one and play a major through West|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  Yes much harder by North and 6@d instead of 5NT is possible|pg||
nt|jeanhari: 5@D more probably to reach|pg||
nt|jeanhari: :)|pg||
nt|xenya: trap hand for NS|pg||
mb|4H!|an|optional RKC|nt|jeanhari: that was too fast for my typing|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: 3 NT may be not an option anymore - doesnt mind defending minor suit|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Not sure what sort of hand 3NT indicates in their methods but it doesn't look that attractive with 4405 shape and understandably hard for South to pass|pg||
mb|4S|an|min|nt|nigel_k:  They may still be ok in 4NT or 5@c if they can stop|pg||
mb|p|nt|jeanhari: is was vulnerable|pg||
nt|sybarra: we may just see a claim |pg||
mb|4N!|an|RKC|nt|Vugraphzbt: LOL, Bertens shuffled, said 600 and everyone agreed|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: Didn't even show his cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: 3 NT is an option....|pg||
nt|xenya: 6@C is excellent, looking at NS's hands|pg||
mb|5H!|nt|burry1975: 3nt is highly likely made due to the friendly heart position|pg||
nt|sharkey: indeed|pg||
mb|d!|nt|xenya: on a good day, you might even make 7|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  After the 1@h overcall it still isn't bad but I don't know if I'd want to be there|pg||
nt|xenya: and it looks like 6@C can be made here despite the 5-0 trump split|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: doesnt have enough transportation i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: I dont think he can do it |pg||
nt|burry1975: just enough...as long as you dare to begin with the ace of hearts|pg||
nt|sharkey: have to pick up @C suit as well|pg||
nt|sybarra: another "all in" move imo |pg||
mb|5N|nt|sharkey: may be double dummy|pg||
nt|burry1975: yes first the 2 of clubs, then finesse clubs and then ace of hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|burry1975: but like i said... you need to have a crystal bowl:-)|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|mb|6N|nt|sharkey: is he able to cash @HA - 9th trick?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|xenya: 6N by S is hopeless though|pg||

pc|s2|nt|sybarra: wd |pg||
pc|s9|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|sharkey: E has shown M so has to play for stiff Honor|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  It looks like South expected North to have a balanced hand, or he would not have insisted on diamonds|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like NS have failed to handle this properly -- landing in a 7-0 fit instead of 5-3|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, Nigel, most likely |pg||
nt|nigel_k:  It isn't going to get better no matter how long he keeps staring at the cards|pg||

nt|vugraphzbt: true :)|pg||

nt|rnmalik: Bas any discussion on the table|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|burry1975: he bid 7H! wow!|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: Loads|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: Too much to relay|pg||
nt|xenya: declarer was probably trying cater for trumps 4-1 -- asuming they are 3-2, there were simpler lines of play |pg||
mb|1N!|nt|burry1975: i'd open 4 spades|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  On board 21 they are playing 7@cx at the other table|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: 4@S for me|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|sybarra: XX= 3 @S  is my guess |pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sharkey: 4@S shud make; however there may be some choices to make|pg||
nt|burry1975: i'd say XX is points|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: that too |pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: If XX shows 3@S, then what's 2@S? Or is XX just stronger than 2@S?|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think it was points |pg||
nt|sybarra: didnt look at the E hand carefully sorry |pg||

nt|sharkey: good duck by Jansma|pg||

nt|nigel_k:  The perils of bidding grand slams - so often they don't even make a small slam at the other table|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c4|nt|nigel_k:  Should East or West have done more here?|pg||
nt|jeanhari: one too high but 3@C makes|pg||
nt|rnmalik: the same with 3@H makes|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|xenya: declarer can't possibly go wrong on a @H switch now |pg||
nt|xenya: the way the cards lie|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|h9|nt|burry1975: i think east might have done something more, but its not clear cut|pg||

pc|hT|pc|h2|pg||
pc|hA|nt|burry1975: i reckon he downgraded his king of hearts|pg||
nt|burry1975: so brink gained quite some imps on the last two boards|pg||
nt|burry1975: however as PO said...if EW would have bid 5D in the previous one...he would be the one laughed at. |pg||
nt|burry1975: but no guts no glory. As I stated before. He likes to be active|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I couldn't work out if 5@d makes on board 8 but it would be close|pg||
nt|burry1975: he tried to play poker once, but he didnt know what folding was:-)|pg||
nt|jeanhari: no cant draw trumps|pg||
pc|dT|nt|jeanhari: sorry i'm wrong|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|s2|pc|hQ|nt|jeanhari: if NS duck one round of spades they can arrange a ruff|pg||
nt|jeanhari: so declarer has to play spades first?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: now things are differenW should have played a @S from the table to make the hand|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
mc|10|nt|nigel_k:  I think 4@s is a better contract but the lie of the heart suit means 3NT is safe unless East starts off by leading a heart|pg||

nt|burry1975: so the white house strikes back with 45 unanswered Imps in the last five boards|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Maybe this set will never end|pg||
nt|burry1975: I think the white house likes that thought|pg||
nt|burry1975: this set can't last long enough:-)|pg||
nt|sharkey: good defence by NS - forcing with repeated @D leads|pg||
nt|burry1975: good effort but wont be good enough.. |pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: Classic NE trump holdings|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s2|nt|Vugraphzbt: Brink's X of 5@C gained 9 IMPs; OR played 5@D-2|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Yes, he can't make if West has @cA anyway|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d6|pc|dK|nt|nigel_k:  Running the nine of clubs would be ideal but the entries aren't there to do it safely|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dJ|pc|d7|nt|burry1975: same defense. South trowing a heart and declarer playing jack of hearts. They copy the play |pg||

nt|boedhy: hi Jan|pg||
nt|imp_jan: hoi Ruud|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c6|pc|c2|nt|boedhy: this will be interesting. Could players all aroun in a tight match anything can happen.|pg||

pc|cA|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|s6|pg||

nt|burry1975: true, can't argue with success|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk1: The 3rd set was scheduled to start 5 minutes ago|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|sybarra: will they get both hands in |pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s4|nt|burry1975: 4h can be set. In the open room verhees however could make it on a stripsqueeze|pg||
nt|sybarra: come back by the White House team impressiver here,  will be great next set! |pg||
nt|burry1975: however he misread the ending so still ended up down one|pg||
nt|sharkey: What is 1! opening?|pg||
nt|burry1975: for whose interested please check the playing records for this board and the three card ending|pg||
nt|sharkey: 1@D|pg||
nt|sybarra: remember they play a (tarzan) @C system |pg||
pc|s6|pc|s7|nt|rnmalik: Board 8 NS lost 11 imps|pg||
nt|jeanhari: good partscore , will it make?|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: Grace time is over now as well|pg||
nt|xenya: @H lead would beat 3N, but it's rightsided here -- as in the other room|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c5|nt|burry1975: ew should be able to cash their spades at a certain point. so this should lead to down 1|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: 5 minutes of grace time just commenced|pg||
nt|sybarra: although I am surprised he didnt bid 1 @H |pg||
pc|c2|pc|c9|pg||
nt|sharkey: ty Shirley - so cud be down to 0?|pg||
nt|sybarra: Many thanks, to our excellent operator Bas....no clue if I will have time later to say  @H@H|pg||
nt|sharkey: May be shud have been 1@H opening and 2@D showing good raise?|pg||
nt|burry1975: bas, did bauke really open 1d?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: Yup, as far as I could see|pg||
nt|sybarra: Thanks also to my co commentators Carl and Frank.   We appreciate your time, insights and humor.   |pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: Thanks Shirley, it was my pleasure :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: We may have another bd  but who knows?|pg||
nt|burry1975: thanks all|pg||
nt|sharkey: are we already done?|pg||
nt|sharkey: thanks all|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: Nope, 28 too|pg||
nt|burry1975: well with bauke declaring this may take some more time|pg||
nt|sybarra: we may have another bd,  if they get to play it |pg||
nt|sharkey: we may have another ½ hour to go yet....|pg||
nt|sybarra: and we have another session today |pg||
nt|Walddk1: They don't take boards away in Europe. That's an ACBL thing|pg||
nt|Walddk1: They penalise them for violating time|pg||
nt|sybarra: that is better R |pg||
nt|sharkey: last board cud be a swing board too|pg||
nt|sybarra: you must be peaking |pg||
nt|sharkey: while you wait HedyG has been kind enuff to supply a link to their respective systems:|pg||
nt|burry1975: a spade looks tempting however if the ace of spades is onside declarer expects a club ruff|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: Actually Roland, apparently the players received an e-mail saying that no time penalties would be issued, but boards cancelled|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: Or so I was told by Sjoert Brink|pg||
nt|sharkey: http://www.ecatsbridge.org/documents/files/ConventionCards/2008MindSportGamesBeijing/Open/Netherlands/muller-dewijs.pdf|pg||
nt|Walddk1: I see, but that has not happened|pg||
nt|sharkey: system for Muller - de Wijs|pg||
nt|burry1975: and will only make then with hearts 3-2 and the 3 card heart suit ruffing|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: Indeed|pg||
nt|Walddk1: I now hear that this only applies if they can't play all boards due to weather conditions|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: Looking outside; more snow is piling up, with increased winds|pg||
nt|sharkey: we assume S opened 1@H|pg||
nt|burry1975: well in that case they can play segment 4, 5 and 6 aswell today|pg||
nt|sharkey: Has anyone checked if Muller's awake?|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Muller is just going through all 8,321 combinations|pg||
pc|d3|nt|sybarra: maybe he is staring out window a the snow |pg||
nt|henryb: this could have been defeated by a heart or a club lead, but the automatic spade is declarer's eighth trick and the club is the ninth|pg||
pc|d7|nt|rnmalik: should be made|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d8|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d9|nt|nigel_k:  Yes, North is easily strong enough for 2NT|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d4|pg||
nt|burry1975: spade lead is asked for now, else we have the same stripsqueeze|pg||
nt|burry1975: I will confess....i won't find that|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1S!|mb|d|mb|r!|nt|boedhy: aggressive rdl !?|pg||
mb|2H|mb|2S|nt|roghog: No attractive bid for South, but he doesn't like to pass|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|3C|nt|imp_jan: very agressive 3@C bid by North|pg||
nt|boedhy: He Roger my friend... dont think south has an alternative....|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roghog: Hi Ruud. Hope you have recovered from your defeat in the summer (at jeu de boules!)|pg||
mb|p|nt|boedhy: I agree Jan rdl shouldhave led to pass but probably will not get doubled and make 8 or even 9 tricks|pg||
pc|sA|nt|imp_jan: i checked west's rdbl, might be 5m + 4M (not that he has that type of hand)|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s9|pc|s2|pg||
nt|roghog: So the Bus Driver is at the wheel - as the Canadian juniors nicknamed him|pg||
pc|c3|nt|roghog: Aren't Canadians witty??   Hmmm|pg||
pc|c4|nt|boedhy: think he can make it @H switch would have made live difficult tho....but very hard to find|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cT|pg||
nt|imp_jan: got the right explanation now: wests dbl shows 3crd support|pg||
nt|imp_jan: makes more sense|pg||
nt|boedhy: yes ok then 3@c still very aggressive but then thats there style and will win points here|pg||
nt|boedhy: setting up @d needs 3-3 in both minors ....but is there an alternative|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sK|pc|sQ|pc|s4|pg||

mb|p|mb|2S|nt|burry1975: a game for NS to end with, this shouldnt take that long|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzbt: last board of this segment|pg||
nt|henryb: notice in the other room that South took a preference to partner's second suit|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|burry1975: 3nt by N?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: Yup Rahed|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: *Rashed|pg||
nt|jeanhari: yes, tx all for watching|pg||
nt|jeanhari: tx to Bas for excellent operating word|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: Thanks all, we'll be back tomorrow @@ 4:30 AM NY time, 10:30 Paris AM time and 8:30 PM Sydney, I think|pg||
nt|vugraphzbt: we should restart at 13.00|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|sybarra: oh oh |pg||
nt|burry1975: well, tarzan not build for this probably|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: Thanks Jean, my pleasure as always :)|pg||
nt|jeanhari: probably come to Utrecht tomorrow, see you there|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Thanks Jean and Bas|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  This is a pretty good slam in clubs - basically on one of two finesses|pg||
pc|sK|nt|henryb: that is he anticipated that North could have four hearts and five clubs|pg||
pc|s8|nt|burry1975: 2d is probably a relay after which 3S shows a splinter|pg||
pc|s9|nt|jeanhari: oeps, Huub Bertens going for a score!|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: See you tomorrow then, if I get there tomorrow morning :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Scores are level now, thanks Jean and Bas-entertaining|pg||
nt|jeanhari: finding the cards lying well for his partner|pg||
pc|s2|pg||

nt|Vugraphzbt: Oops, sorry!|pg||
nt|burry1975: that looks more normal indeed|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: Well, I already got my compliments ;)|pg||
nt|burry1975: sorry simon for thinking you actually passed!|pg||
nt|sharkey: you keep us on our toes Bas :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 2 correct finesses:)|pg||
nt|jeanhari: I think all will be decided in the last set tomorrow|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cJ|pc|cQ|nt|burry1975: now three overtricks|pg||
nt|jeanhari: EW open getting the hearts wrong with the Bxx  opp. H9xxx|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|jeanhari: so 12 imps to Onstein|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I don't know if I would double 1@s with South but it looks better than the balancing double|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  And certainly worked out better|pg||
nt|henryb: I think North might have bid 2N over the balancin double, showing two places to play, but he certainly would have corrected 3@d to 3@h|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hT|pc|h2|nt|burry1975: pretty good i'd say but missed by drink drijver which is also not unreasonable|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: And another 11 on this board?|pg||
nt|jeanhari: declarer doesnt know but cant go wrong here|pg||
nt|jeanhari: indeed|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I agree|pg||
nt|henryb: 3@c making 130 was a spectacular result in the other room|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|burry1975: the Q?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|sharkey: shud try @C first|pg||
pc|s5|nt|burry1975: 11 imps back to the WH so it's tight match. The carry over is won back by 't onstein so it looks like a long exciting weekend in Utrecht|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sQ|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|pc|dJ|nt|burry1975: the ten looked 100%|pg||

nt|burry1975: which is good considering we are stuck inside with the freezing cold outside:-)|pg||

nt|nigel_k:  Some of us are enjoying summer though|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: :)|pg||
nt|henryb: This will drift off down 1|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s7|pc|h3|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|nt|burry1975: however they are also still playing in open room and it looks like a big swing is coming there aswell on board 12|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hK|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|pc|c6|pc|c2|pg||
nt|burry1975: sjoert and bas did that quite well on board 12|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Yes quite easy to end in 4@s on 12 and I'm not sure it is the wrong contract just on the N/S cards|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Anyway that's the last one for this set so thanks for watching everyone|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Thanks fellow commentators and operator as well|pg||
nt|burry1975: segment two is scheduled to start in 10 minutes however i expect this will be postponed a bit|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: (12 tricks made here, I misunderstood wat Brink said, as he said he'd finesse Paulissen for the @SK)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sybarra: hmmm |pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: Thanks all, we'll be back later, I hope|pg||
nt|burry1975: well....didnt expect that|pg||
