mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cJ|nt|burry1975: jansma needs to overtake and play ace and another trump?|pg||
nt|sharynr: as can paulissen :)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jallerton: can then take @d finesse and use @cA as late entry|pg||
nt|burry1975: but then drijver can take diamond finesse|pg||
nt|imp_jan: interesting contract|pg||
nt|imp_jan: where bertens elected to overcall 1@S, Paulissen passed|pg||
nt|sharynr: not much of an overcall. 2@S would make more sense|pg||
nt|burry1975: or as one of the specs point out. drijver can duck a spade and play on a diamond spade squeeze, many roads to ten tricks|pg||
nt|jallerton: squeeze line needs quite a lot|pg||
nt|jallerton: must be wose odds than a finesse|pg||

nt|imp_jan: no he already gave up that line|pg||
nt|burry1975: yes saw that after i pressed the enter button:p|pg||
nt|burry1975: so looks like drijver does choose the squeeze line|pg||
nt|imp_jan: first he tests the diamonds 3-3 of course|pg||
nt|jallerton: could play @dKJ, running - picks up 3-3 or Qxxx or Q10xx in E|pg||

nt|Vugraphzbt: Such coincidence :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: Gd morning|pg||
nt|sybarra: gm Carl  welcome |pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: It seems we'll have to restart the broadcast in order to correct the score. We apologize for the inconvenience|pg||
nt|Walddk8: score incorrect, pls shut down|pg||
nt|sybarra: we had an exciting last set  W.H  took the lead |pg||
mb|d|mb|2C|nt|andersk: Looks like we have 14 board to come here!|pg||
nt|burry1975: final this year as expected between the White house and 't Onstein|pg||
nt|sybarra: better! |pg||
nt|rnmalik: I was a kib some fantastic play:)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|sybarra: re score |pg||
mb|p|nt|burry1975: the two semi professional teams in the Netherlands|pg||
nt|sybarra: toughest 4 players perhaps in the other room |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: n/s play Tarzan club |pg||
nt|sybarra: assuming we have same pair |pg||
mb|d|nt|andersk: When I saw the line up, I kinda digured that this is "the match" of the championship|pg||
mb|p|nt|burry1975: at this table Brink - Drijver who play together for a number of years now and had a lot of good results since|pg||
nt|andersk: that was a great lead from East|pg||
nt|burry1975: jansma paulissen only play together for two years now. This year they won the butler in the RR i believe|pg||
nt|andersk: Probably only lead to set this contract|pg||
nt|burry1975: i think they were both members of the junior team that won the world championships in 87|pg||
nt|andersk: looks like MUD lead for me|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Yes excellent lead, attacks declarer's entries while the diamonds are blocked|pg||
nt|andersk: MUD is Medium Up Down, this is to show partner that lead was from weak 3 card suit|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  On any other lead, declarer can concede a diamond and reach the good diamonds with the @sA|pg||
nt|andersk: next card will be @S 9 then @S 3|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: Drijver just asked about the leads. Paulissen explained 2nd 4th from any holding, but from eg KJT(xx) the J. "Very old-fashioned"|pg||
mb|2S|nt|rnmalik: delayed this segment by 45 minutes|pg||
nt|sybarra: Brink/Drijver v Jansma/Paulssen      |pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: assume 1 NT = 12-14?|pg||
mb|p|nt|andersk: maybe thay will start plying MUD now|pg||
nt|andersk: :9|pg||
nt|sybarra: but our guys are no slouches!|pg||
mb|p|pc|hJ|nt|rnmalik: tough contract would need some play|pg||
nt|sybarra: *Paulissen.....sorry |pg||
pc|h3|nt|sybarra: yes think that range, it is a club system  |pg||
pc|hK|nt|Vugraphzbt: EW play upside-down count and attitude|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h9|nt|andersk: When you see the layout here! Normally they win 1 NT, defenders "almost never" finds the holding in every suit|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hA|pg||
nt|burry1975: with hearts 3 3 this can make now if declarer guesses right|pg||
pc|cK|nt|Walddk1: Welcome to Jean Harings|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c6|nt|sybarra: named Tarzan Club as result of their names....wijs/muller sounding much like the name of the guy (Weismuller) who starred in the old Tarzan movies|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: Hi Jean :)|pg||
nt|jeanhari: hi.. way away for a minute, cooking dinner|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome Jean |pg||
nt|rnmalik: Welcome|pg||
nt|jeanhari: I think the players persuaded Hans to play 2 sets each the first day|pg||
nt|sybarra: do tell us what is for dinner?|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|andersk: well played|pg||
nt|burry1975: yes probably the best line and still leaves option open to run the diamonds|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  The defenders winning the first diamond means they probably are not breaking|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I think he will still need to guess clubs to make|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: Brink just remarked they've been playing the first board for 12 minutes now|pg||

nt|jeanhari: but to the bridge now...|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1N!|an|14-16|nt|burry1975: ew can make 5 spades, NS can bid up to 5D which is only down 1|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|andersk: No entrances in East, so 10 tricks in @H for NS, and 11 EW in @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|jeanhari: I think indeed the level of play wasn"t that good in the second set|pg||
pc|h5|nt|burry1975: 2d probably a non minimum heart raise|pg||
nt|andersk: The question is if Jansma will let them play 5@D, probably since he hold 3 small @H and alot too defense with|pg||
nt|jeanhari: some questionable defense and declarerplay|pg||
nt|sybarra: we have seen better |pg||
pc|h3|pc|h9|nt|andersk: wow|pg||
nt|burry1975: the double fit made it 'easy' for paulissen|pg||
nt|andersk: If 2 @D is a @H raise, I cant see how Jansma can get away from 6@S|pg||
nt|burry1975: 6d would put some pressure on it. and costs only 2 imps, will brink do it?|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|jeanhari: proves how difficult the game is|pg||
pc|dA|nt|burry1975: dbl here shows I want to bid 6D|pg||
nt|andersk: we are 26 mintes in the set, they have played 1 NT = and now bidding board 2, this will be a long day :)|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I thought I had done well to avoid Muller's table |pg||
nt|burry1975: difficult decision for drijver here. Odds on he will bid|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: Actually, they've only completed one board there too :)|pg||

pc|d5|pc|d2|pc|d3|pg||
nt|burry1975: wrong bet :-)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: Paulissen just requested the TD to come to the table|pg||
nt|sybarra: easy to see from here about the spade lead not so easy at the table perhaps |pg||

nt|imp_jan: u need help Sharyn?|pg||

nt|sharynr: no, east does|pg||
nt|burry1975: i predict that drijver brink will compete to the 7 level if necessary|pg||

mb|5H|nt|po-s: I doubt that 4D would have helped. A good raise doesn´t promise the DA - could easily be club honours|pg||

nt|andersk: Im just happy that the previous board was easy to declear:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: Remarkable how (semi-)professional players don't flinch at a board like this, but the worse the players get, the worse their reaction to such a result|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: TD has been called by Paulissen again|pg||

pc|d5|pc|dA|pc|d6|nt|burry1975: ten of hearts doesnt indicate a club entry so brink thinking whether he can trust this. However even with spades breaking only 8 tricks so he needs to play clubs|pg||

nt|sharkey: May be shud have been 1@H opening and 2@D showing good raise?|pg||
nt|burry1975: bas, did bauke really open 1d?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: Yup, as far as I could see|pg||
nt|sybarra: Thanks also to my co commentators Carl and Frank.   We appreciate your time, insights and humor.   |pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: Thanks Shirley, it was my pleasure :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: We may have another bd  but who knows?|pg||
nt|burry1975: thanks all|pg||
nt|sharkey: are we already done?|pg||
nt|sharkey: thanks all|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: Nope, 28 too|pg||
nt|burry1975: well with bauke declaring this may take some more time|pg||
nt|sybarra: we may have another bd,  if they get to play it |pg||
nt|sharkey: we may have another ½ hour to go yet....|pg||
nt|sybarra: and we have another session today |pg||
nt|Walddk1: They don't take boards away in Europe. That's an ACBL thing|pg||
nt|Walddk1: They penalise them for violating time|pg||
nt|sybarra: that is better R |pg||
nt|sharkey: last board cud be a swing board too|pg||
nt|sybarra: you must be peaking |pg||
nt|sharkey: while you wait HedyG has been kind enuff to supply a link to their respective systems:|pg||
nt|burry1975: a spade looks tempting however if the ace of spades is onside declarer expects a club ruff|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: Actually Roland, apparently the players received an e-mail saying that no time penalties would be issued, but boards cancelled|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: Or so I was told by Sjoert Brink|pg||
nt|sharkey: http://www.ecatsbridge.org/documents/files/ConventionCards/2008MindSportGamesBeijing/Open/Netherlands/muller-dewijs.pdf|pg||
nt|Walddk1: I see, but that has not happened|pg||
nt|sharkey: system for Muller - de Wijs|pg||
nt|burry1975: and will only make then with hearts 3-2 and the 3 card heart suit ruffing|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: Indeed|pg||
nt|Walddk1: I now hear that this only applies if they can't play all boards due to weather conditions|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: Looking outside; more snow is piling up, with increased winds|pg||
nt|sharkey: we assume S opened 1@H|pg||
nt|burry1975: well in that case they can play segment 4, 5 and 6 aswell today|pg||
nt|sharkey: Has anyone checked if Muller's awake?|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Muller is just going through all 8,321 combinations|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|sybarra: maybe he is staring out window a the snow |pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|rnmalik: should be made|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cJ|pc|c8|pc|c2|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cQ|nt|burry1975: spade lead is asked for now, else we have the same stripsqueeze|pg||
nt|burry1975: I will confess....i won't find that|pg||
pc|d3|pc|cK|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d2|nt|sybarra: or a spec suggested S is playing "Sominex coup"  (Put opps to sleep) |pg||
nt|Walddk1: Was too tough to find the spade switch|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d6|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s3|nt|Walddk1: Muller must have a pretty good feeling about the location of @SA|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s9|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  The defense discarded the setting trick but now diamonds are blocked so still down I think|pg||
pc|s6|nt|nigel_k:  He could have afforded @d8 instead of @d5|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: The grace time has ended|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|nigel_k:  As spectators point out, if West cashes the heart declarer can discard a diamond |pg||
pc|sT|pc|s4|pg||
mc|8|nt|jeanhari: exciting day, both teams not able to keep the score below 100 in 42 boards|pg||

nt|imp_jan: a lot of tricks in a heart slam|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|jallerton: Roland would get to 7@h here|pg||
mb|1H!|an|!S's|mb|p|nt|imp_jan: jansma-paulissen play reversals |pg||
nt|imp_jan: @h = spades|pg||
nt|imp_jan: and spades = hearts (may be, not sure, have to admit)|pg||
nt|imp_jan: not easy to bid slam in the 4th suit|pg||
nt|burry1975: 2clubs by east?|pg||
nt|imp_jan: yep|pg||
nt|jallerton: Yes, but East can choose which suit becomes the 4th suit|pg||
nt|sharynr: would 2@H no be a reverse?|pg||
nt|burry1975: and then 2h as 4th suit|pg||
nt|imp_jan: well 2@C looks pretty syandard|pg||
nt|imp_jan: unless something conv going on|pg||
nt|jallerton: in standard bidding he is also worth a reverse into @H|pg||
nt|imp_jan: no, no reverse on min values with a misfit|pg||
nt|vugraphzbu: there is a problem with the call from east|pg||
nt|imp_jan: what is goin on?|pg||
nt|vugraphzbu: there was another time penalty for 't Onstein, -3 so standings are 92-68 now|pg||
nt|burry1975: whats the problem he bid 2c and 2h at the same time?|pg||
nt|vugraphzbu: Easts wanted to bid 1@S but frist bid 2@CD|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|burry1975: 2h - 3h and then? 4h? |pg||
mb|2H!|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|imp_jan: got informed that east shld have bid 1@S, showing 4@H|pg||
nt|burry1975: well...then they may get into the grand by accident:p|pg||
nt|sharynr: if that is the case, then 3@H here only shows 3 cards|pg||
nt|imp_jan: well, we will see|pg||
nt|jallerton: Indeed, Sharyn, and that is a big problem for E|pg||
nt|po-s: so now he should have a good hand without a good heart stopper?|pg||
nt|po-s: and no spade support|pg||
mb|4H|nt|sharynr: probably, or wants NT played from spade stopper side|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jallerton: are they playing with screens?|pg||
nt|sharynr: Jansma thinks different :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzbu: yes they are|pg||
mb|p|nt|imp_jan: yes they r playing with screens, even with bidding boxes|pg||
nt|jallerton: Was West aware of the TD call?|pg||
nt|po-s: who said he should bid 1 spade?Not one of the players surely|pg||
nt|vugraphzbu: SW were sure of the TD call|pg||
nt|imp_jan: i heard that from a person close to Jansma|pg||
pc|c4|nt|po-s: begins with an A?|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cT|pc|c9|pg||
nt|burry1975: well even then ...they'll get 3nt plus 4:-)|pg||
nt|imp_jan: no comments :)|pg||
nt|jallerton: Then West is in a difficult position - he has unauthorised information from the TD call|pg||
nt|po-s: grand slam missed|pg||
nt|sharynr: does anyone thnk east should take another bid over 4@H?|pg||
nt|imp_jan: he ethically missed the grand|pg||
nt|burry1975: normally he's not that ethical is he?:-)|pg||
nt|imp_jan: jansma? he can be pretty ethical|pg||
nt|burry1975: joking:-)|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c8|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
nt|imp_jan: when i played with him, he was quite ethical|pg||
nt|po-s: not really. I doubt that he would bid 4H opposite a partner without four hearts|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|imp_jan: later, i lost track|pg||
nt|burry1975: as good old piet borst said 'a good player is not ethical':-)|pg||
nt|po-s: It seems to me he actually used the UI|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|sharynr: anyway, let's not question ethics.. |pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|pc|hJ|pc|h3|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|pc|h7|pc|hQ|pg||
mc|12|nt|po-s: of course we (and they) don´t know what the TD call was about|pg||
nt|imp_jan: why not, it is fun|pg||

nt|jeanhari: probably come to Utrecht tomorrow, see you there|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Thanks Jean and Bas|pg||
mb|p|mb|6H|nt|nigel_k:  This is a pretty good slam in clubs - basically on one of two finesses|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|burry1975: 2d is probably a relay after which 3S shows a splinter|pg||
mb|p|nt|jeanhari: oeps, Huub Bertens going for a score!|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: See you tomorrow then, if I get there tomorrow morning :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Scores are level now, thanks Jean and Bas-entertaining|pg||
nt|jeanhari: finding the cards lying well for his partner|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sybarra: aha  better!|pg||

nt|Vugraphzbt: And another 11 on this board?|pg||
nt|jeanhari: declarer doesnt know but cant go wrong here|pg||
nt|jeanhari: indeed|pg||
pc|hK|nt|burry1975: the Q?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|sharkey: shud try @C first|pg||
pc|h7|nt|burry1975: 11 imps back to the WH so it's tight match. The carry over is won back by 't onstein so it looks like a long exciting weekend in Utrecht|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h6|pc|hT|mc|12|nt|burry1975: the ten looked 100%|pg||
