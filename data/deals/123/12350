nt|yo_yo: 3NT looks ok too|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: tough hand all round here par seems to be a save in 6@S |pg||
mb|1S|nt|Walddk5: http://www.camrosebridge.com/  for a website with lots of useful information|pg||
mb|p|nt|snetram: agressive again|pg||
mb|1N!|mb|p|nt|hedyg: NS play very weak weak|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Kvangraven is known to bid every time he has 13 cards|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hamilton likes that response|pg||
mb|2N|nt|marlowepi: the hand is not really worth an overcall followed by a double. but i like immediate double even less.|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Hi Marshall|pg||
nt|garnetts: I would have bid on the South hand--especially since partner has passed|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but i assume you would overcall|pg||
mb|p|nt|coch draig: 1N is forcing of course|pg||
mb|3S|an|a|nt|mcarroll: There are possibilities to make this|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 4@S is very pushy |pg||
nt|rodal f: 6-9 and 5@H+ I belive|pg||
mb|4C|nt|hedyg: best defense would be @C lead and 10@d by S|pg||
nt|snetram: i am not agree with 2@H opening. Bad bridge - A,K and weak suit ( 5332)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: some like a few point to overcall |pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: but that is totally DD|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|mcarroll: and this lead helps|pg||
nt|rodal f: If A and @S|pg||
mb|4S|nt|garnetts: well done all round |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Won't it just go 2 down with normal defence?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: silent opposition in the open room|pg||
nt|coch draig: nice auction|pg||
pc|h2|nt|garnetts: A@D and and an underlead will get maximum|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h3|pc|h6|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe not any more|pg||
nt|hedyg: not if gets to disc a @d on @H and ruff a @D|pg||
nt|athene: south didn't anticipate that declarer might have two heart tricks :) his partner has to have a pretty bad suit for that to happen :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: a bit risky|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pg||

nt|hedyg: his turn to bid?|pg||

nt|rodal f: Done|pg||
nt|yo_yo: I'm a bit surprised Rex Anderson didnt support @S immediately|pg||
pc|h4|nt|garnetts: what else |pg||
nt|mcarroll: well done|pg||
pc|h5|nt|yo_yo: i tried it recently and declarer's singleton King made|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hA|pg||
nt|garnetts: one off rather than two |pg||
nt|yo_yo: better one down than making :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: but is off for sure--more risky if it might give the contract|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i hate that look on partner's face when it makes|pg||
nt|marlowepi: is that worse than the look on teammates faces?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgj: N closed board to ask east about W's pass in bidding|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|nt|Walddk2: Soft defence, but down it goes|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i dont blame him|pg||
pc|dT|nt|hedyg: if you are going to play @d though i am sure 10@d is best|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgj: played from N when on table|pg||

nt|Walddk2: First you have to bid 3NT, and then make it|pg||
nt|chick: but still a 2-point spread|pg||
nt|garnetts: so what--he wants to have his cake and eat it|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ah it was DOPI|pg||
nt|yo_yo: pass showing 1 key card|pg||
nt|marlowepi: seems odd that internationalists would not have an agreement about handling interference over 4N. is this a new partnership or something?|pg||
nt|coch draig: immediate raises are pre-emptive i believe|pg||
nt|yo_yo: they are a very experienced pairing  so I guess it's all covered|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Rex Anderson has been playing Camrose bridge for ....  ever|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|p|mb|p|nt|garnetts: Like much of what I see today--in my view if North wants an adjustment he should employ a chiropractor|pg||
mb|1S|nt|yo_yo: i wouldnt have an agreement about the final pass  but yes over 4NT  |pg||
nt|yo_yo: Shields and Denning seem to have been around for a long time, is that right Mark?|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: he's gone for tea :)|pg||
nt|coch draig: yes they played alot years ago (b4 my time) then took time out for family work etc but reformed v successfully|pg||
nt|coch draig: sry typing is slower when cold :)|pg||
nt|Walddk7: http://www.camrosebridge.com/  for standings, convention cards and other useful information|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|garnetts: Good lead for declarer here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i doubt thatthe final pass was the issue|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c2|nt|garnetts: close between small and the Q |pg||
nt|mcarroll: at least they avoided the 4-4 @S fit|pg||
pc|c9|nt|hedyg: 1NT is a constructive bid|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cT|pc|c5|nt|snetram: NS pay at least 500 in any contract|pg||
nt|athene: surprising to pass 2nt there with two aces and two potentially useful tens|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|athene: after his 4@S last board|pg||
nt|hedyg: he already bid his hand when he bid 1NT|pg||
nt|yo_yo: any photos mark?|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cQ|nt|athene: north dodged a bullet, doubling rather than overcalling 1nt - that might have led to a lot of trouble for NS|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I suppose this happens when you open a featureless 11 count|pg||
pc|c8|nt|hedyg: 1NT should show 8-10|pg||
nt|chick: both tens are in suits that W doesn't have, so they may not be worth much|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  quite a rare occasion to play on 1st level, but EW have no power to compete and NS have no game|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|chick: same with the length in @Ds|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|s2|nt|rodal f: Norwegian specs will tell me if I'm wrong. Belive it's still 6 cup rounds before the final are to be played. At 3rd round the best teams play there first cup match. |pg||
nt|athene: i would say both tens are working quite hard|pg||
nt|chick: he has almost nothing to help set up tricks in W's suits|pg||
nt|athene: give partner nothing in diamonds and just the jack in spades for instance|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|s9|nt|athene: @S10 and @D10 both help to give you a double stopper|pg||
nt|coch draig: photos letts see...|pg||
pc|s6|nt|yo_yo: agree  Denning made a good? decision not to go on|pg||
nt|yo_yo: mind you next time they might miss game|pg||

mc|8|nt|snetram: typical auction - 1@S - X -pas - 2@D - X - pas...|pg||
nt|garnetts: odd play surely |pg||
nt|coch draig: pat shields more camera shy|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgj: swift claim - declarer gave them 3 tricks|pg||

mb|3D|nt|athene: ...but hardly a routine negative double|pg||
nt|bjacobs: very weird|pg||
nt|athene: i guess Jones was intending to bid spades over whatever his partner did, to show a 3-card limit raise|pg||
mb|3S|nt|fabsayc: double is not likely to hurt when partner has bid spades and you have fit there|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|bjacobs: It's still weird.  The normal technique to show the limit raise is to cue-bid|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: well bill some play the cue bid as game forcing, and use the double for 3 card limit raise|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And what do they do with 4 hearts?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|fabsayc: bid 3H|pg||
nt|bjacobs: huh?|pg||

nt|fabsayc: sorry, 3@S|pg||
nt|bjacobs: huh?|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|nt|bjacobs: 4 *hearts*|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|fabsayc: but i like the european approach where 2nt is also a spade raise|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|c4|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, you still haven't answered the question: what do you do with 4 in the other major|pg||
nt|bjacobs: and say, 8-10 points|pg||
nt|fabsayc: oh i double with that also, can handle both as william said|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|pc|cA|pc|cT|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cK|pc|c7|pc|c9|pg||
mc|11|nt|fabsayc: partner treats it as a normal negative double until i correct to spades|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  if 1@s is limited (let's say up to 15 point) - the danger isn't big|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but if a 4/4 @H fit, then there is a danger|pg||
mb|p|nt|coch draig: should be a nothing board this|pg||
nt|yo_yo: here's David  : http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=684|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgj: sorry guys - players have B4 on table|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgj: so we'll just have to wait for B3 - and i'll have to work out how to put in contract and score for B4 later|pg||
nt|coch draig: obviously some kind of delay at the table|pg||
nt|yo_yo: any specs got pics online of Anderson or Denning  ( not many to ask)|pg||
nt|coch draig: more info about Denning / Shields from somebody much older than me obviously,   Pat and Paul won Junior tials in 1976; they were added to the senior trial when one pair dropped ...|pg||
nt|coch draig: out, and they won that too,and played in the Camrose in 1977|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgj: West is declarer here, but not sure of contract - they confused me!|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it's not easy Julia|pg||
nt|yo_yo: I know, I did vugraph myself recently|pg||
nt|yo_yo: awful trying to peer across the table to see if they play @D 2 or @D3|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgj: yes - i need new glasses!|pg||
nt|yo_yo: and if they play fast you are gone!|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  would you ask the dummy? about contract and result|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgj: yes - once finished |pg||
nt|coch draig: 4@s +1 by West appears to be the likely result|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i did ask actually, but they dont like it|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  yes, I know it well too )))|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgj: they playing B4 - i think it may be 1N by W, but will confirm|pg||
nt|yo_yo: in the end i was firm and made them tell me :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: put on my schoolteacher voice|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgj: yes - it was 1N by west up 2 for B4|pg||
nt|coch draig: so what happened on B3?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it coming up now presumably|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  we will see B3|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  we simple missed show (if any) in B4|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgj: now about to bid and plAY 3|pg||
nt|coch draig: right ok i've caught up, they played 3 and 4 out of sequence|pg||

mb|p|nt|garnetts: Not sure how good it is as a %age|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ok laydown at trick 3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: depends on lead as to how good it is. diamond leads hurts the a priori %|pg||
nt|yo_yo: simpson is treading carefully here, no  jump to 2@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzgj: :)|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|athene: you put the jack in right away to find if the finesse is on|pg||
nt|garnetts: Yes no communivation for the double club finesse on nay lead is there?|pg||

nt|garnetts: I prefer 5@C as a picture raise  first round @D control and reasonable clubs |pg||
nt|yo_yo: that sounds great (if it means that )|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: you don't want to run it round to the ace and then finesse because if it lost opps could cash and you would be worse off|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sA|nt|yo_yo: I wouldnt be confident with my partners|pg||
nt|garnetts: Now what is the best way to play clubs?   Take a finesse and play for the drop or cash the ace first?|pg||

nt|athene: auction by not raising immediately|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It seems like a great wy to mislead partner if the bidding gets high in a hurry|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|nt|bjacobs: Absolutely Bill - it's a foolish approach, IMHO|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: suppose it goes 1@S (2@D) X (4@D) now partner bids 5@C and you are past 4@S|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: that is why using both 2nt and cue bid for raises is probably best, i was merely saying why i thought he doubled|pg||

mb|4D|an|a|nt|athene: or try something else?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: he's tried something else, not sure why |pg||
nt|fabsayc: do we like 4@D|pg||
nt|bjacobs: no|pg||
nt|athene: it might be majors or just spades|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think 4@D would be fine if the majors were reversed. |pg||
nt|bjacobs: But here, what could be simpler than 3@S followed by 4@H over 3NT?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: whatever it is i prefer 3@S bid if forcing|pg||
nt|bjacobs: agree|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: he might be scared of west bidding 5@D immediately so he wants to get 5-5 in the majors across as fast as possible|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: i just saw this auction by the dutch, who use inverted response by responder|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i.e. 3@S=hearts, 3@H=spades|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Sort of a transfer regime, I suppose|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Following the theory: "at all costs the 1NT opener must be declarer"|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: it has other benefits|pg||
pc|dA|nt|fabsayc: i.e. it allows you to both compete and force in spades|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d8|pc|d5|pg||

mb|1N|nt|coch draig: what u trying to say Kathy? lol|pg||
mb|3D|nt|yo_yo: Unusual for Peter Crouch to miss a slam, he's one of the best bidders in England|pg||
nt|copeyj: interestingly, when played with @D as trumps it is basically a 5 or 7 hand|pg||

nt|marlowepi: this result is not going to impel NS to interfere when they hold 11 spades in future either|pg||
nt|copeyj: wonder if 2@D is @S and another or if it is both majors|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  would like, Mark|pg||
mb|4S|nt|mcarroll: This certainly looks like an eminently biddable slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: W in the tank|pg||
nt|garnetts: One of the specs used a different word--pathetic |pg||
nt|rodal f: Agree there:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: awkward for west here - 4@S goes past 4@H|pg||

nt|yo_yo: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wooden_spoon_(award)|pg||
pc|d8|nt|athene: the same issue as you have with opening - do you open the shorter suit to give yourself an easier rebid?|pg||
nt|coch draig: wooden spoon is historically said to be given to those that come last|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i recomment Mavis Beacon Mark|pg||
pc|d5|nt|rodal f: Need to be W for the quest|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dK|pg||
nt|copeyj: have no idea what made Simpson open 1NT 3rd in unfavourable - looks like a fairly cruddy 14 count imo|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but he is in scotland now kath|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|yo_yo: you mean he is on the whisky?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: cruddy   - a new word to me|pg||

pc|sT|nt|chick: not for opening bids, but when forced to start at a higher level, like here, yes|pg||
nt|athene: very ugly to force yourself to 5@H|pg||
nt|garnetts: Well I am suprised that everyone got there--not enough grit I hear--not sure if that was meant to describe road conditions or the UK workforce|pg||
nt|copeyj: additionally i wld have led a trump here|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I wonder who is thinking?|pg||
nt|rodal f: A board for presission and/or relays|pg||

pc|hT|nt|coch draig: i'll start practicing miss|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|mcarroll: Pass of the Dbl shows 1st round control?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Normaly RD. Belive pass was for give E space if he had more info to give since 3@C@S looks as relays|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mcarroll: So after all that a flat board|pg||
pc|s3|nt|copeyj: partner has doubled 2@S for penalties and i have QX and a substandard 1N opener|pg||
pc|s6|nt|athene: well if you are going to just treat west as "majors" and not try to emphasise the longer hearts, you might as well bid 3@S then 4@H?|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|copeyj: must stop them ruffing|pg||
nt|rodal f: 1@H normaly show 2-3controls so any problem for W to try 4NT?|pg||

pc|d4|nt|athene: yes, it doesn't help you even if the @S9 forced a big one from east|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That lead has unfortunately cost about 3 tricks|pg||

nt|chick: the trouble with something like neg double, or 4D for majors, is that partner will expect 4-4 type of hand and won't get excited with a 3 card major. with 6-5, I personally prefer ...|pg||
nt|chick: to bid the suits|pg||
nt|copeyj: west is dummy|pg||
nt|copeyj: and has lost the plot|pg||

nt|marlowepi: 5 a.m. everywhere|pg||

nt|coch draig: yes nothing to worry declarer....yet|pg||

pc|h3|pc|h8|pg||

nt|chick: good point, hedy, if you have both available ... but if you are going to actually bid the suits, starting with spades is much easier|pg||

mb|p|mb|4S|an|a|mb|p|nt|fabsayc: i hate it when first cue bid is a shortness, as with 4@H here|pg||
nt|athene: they might reach a bad and very lucky 6@D here|pg||
mb|4N|an|a|mb|p|nt|athene: no way to find about the @DJ, but even if south assumed his partner held that card, slam would still be worse than a finesse|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|mb|6D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: (needs to pick up the @DK and also danger of a club ruff)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: How incredibly lucky - even down to the spade jack (a key entry)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: system bad but lucky?!|pg||
nt|athene: south perhaps hoped his partner held something like @SK @HKQ @DK|pg||
nt|athene: that would be consistent with the bidding|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, one can be sympathetic.  It's an ugly mismatch, and not always easy to find this out|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I wonder what South will say when he sees THIS dummy?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: perhaps but here it took far too long to get openers shape bid|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he will cough|pg||
pc|h7|nt|fabsayc: by the way, is better if playing control responses to let 1nt=3 kings, 1@s=A+K|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: "thank you"|pg||
nt|bjacobs: but surely said with a hint of irony?|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: deadly serious...|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he has only himself to blame here, north merely followed orders|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: the room has gone still|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|d6|pc|d7|pg||
nt|athene: this hand is quite tricky because you have to ruff two clubs as well|pg||

pc|dK|pc|d4|pc|d9|pc|d3|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c9|pc|c2|pc|c6|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d5|pc|dT|nt|bjacobs: The theory being that the weak hand occasionally psyches a minor suit rescue on a short suit, and if you play takeout doubles, it might be passed out|pg||

nt|garnetts: Ragardless of the inadequacy of my 2@S bid|pg||
nt|marlowepi: many pairs play transfers over a double, which allows W to show his long hearts and then make a spade-tolerance raise|pg||
nt|marlowepi: thus showing everything, and in an accurate context|pg||

mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: acol players did that sort of thing in about 1940 but i think most would open 1@D now|pg||
pc|h6|nt|fabsayc: certainly that was true in NA when we played 4 card majors (i was merely a twinkle then)|pg||

nt|athene: this is a difficult hand to play|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|pc|h2|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Very tough.  I like the @HK play - reserving dummy's low trumps for spade ruffs|pg||
pc|sT|nt|athene: on hands like this you have to decide fairly early whether you are going to try to set up a long suit, draw trumps and cash it|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|athene: or alternatively try to crossruff completely|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pg||

pc|s6|pc|c3|pc|dK|nt|fabsayc: only 9 on cross ruff|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|athene: it looks superficially attractive (preventing two fast diamond losers if the ace is wrong) but you are a long way off having enough winners|pg||
nt|athene: throwing the @DK on another spade to set up the suit is a good idea though|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this works though|pg||
nt|bjacobs: East made a huge error covering the @S10.  |pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|bjacobs: In fact, a very basic error.  There was no way declarer was running that card|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And the canape style should tell him that it might be declarer's longer sdie suit|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s8|nt|bjacobs: So  I'll back off a bit from the "basic error" comment.  This is something of a gain for the uninformative canape auction|pg||

mb|1S|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|athene: wow|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: In the CR, West re-opened with 2@H, maybe fearing a penalty pass from partner|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: at this vulnerability he decides to go for the game, but i would have thought passing was normal|pg||
mb|p|pc|cT|nt|bjacobs: 3NT is not going to make, I feel|pg||
nt|bjacobs: @C7 isn't wuite good enough|pg||
nt|athene: with a stiff spade and not THAT much strength, surely you are nowhere near guaranteed to make game|pg||
nt|bjacobs: quite|pg||
nt|athene: so you take the money|pg||
pc|s6|pc|c4|nt|athene: maybe you get 300 or even 500 when game isn't on|pg||
nt|athene: declarer only has eight tricks without the spades|pg||
nt|athene: so i don't see how he can make this|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|c3|pc|s7|nt|athene: declarer ducks there, playing for split spade honours|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|pg||
nt|athene: if he won the first club, then attacked spades, he feared south could win and clear the clubs with north retaining his entry|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h3|pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|pc|sJ|pc|s3|pg||
pc|h4|nt|bjacobs: It seems North didn't want to give declarer 2 club tricks.  But there is a huge flaw in that reasoning|pg||
nt|athene: no problems now after that heart shift|pg||
pc|h6|nt|bjacobs: If declarer just wanted 2 club tricks, he would have won the first trick|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hA|pg||
pc|s8|nt|athene: but if declarer were scared of any suit more than clubs he would hardly have ducked at trick 1|pg||

nt|garnetts: Good morning Kath|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgj: lets hope that 32 is the same as the board on the table|pg||
nt|rodal f: U're forgive Stuart my son:)|pg||
nt|coch draig: a nice easy one to start there, perfect for a sunday morning|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  exactly, few deals to warm up|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Walddk2: *around|pg||
nt|yo_yo: you mean after the night before?|pg||
mb|2C|nt|yo_yo: that bidding may not be correct, i think the operator is concentrating on the results|pg||
nt|athene: this is the last board from previous set so we are getting there :)|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Exactly what can happen when you don't split the files into two of 16|pg||
nt|Walddk7: We emphasize that in our guidelines|pg||
nt|cliveo: That's right, the board was played in 3 @S +1 for a flat board|pg||
nt|athene: i see in the other room NIBU has changed their pair; certainly they had a rough time last set, letting through a few too many no-play contracts|pg||
nt|po-s: it increases the chances to find the right contracts|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Stuart, you may as well shut down. This leads to no good|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Fine the person who is in charge and let him/her sort it out|pg||
nt|Walddk7: >Nothing can be done with the table up|pg||
nt|cliveo: How much do you want to fine them?|pg||
nt|Walddk7: lol  sorry   I meant to say   Find|pg||
nt|mdgraham: How about 200 green points?|pg||
nt|cliveo: I think you were right the first time|pg||
nt|rodal f: For running scores: http://www.camrosebridge.com/action.php|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: I suppose Hamilton will open in 3rd seat|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Krzysztof Martens|pg||
mb|2H|nt|garnetts: The opening bid actually makes 4@S a good prospect|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|snetram: hi all|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: yes you are right, simpson with look favourably upon his @CK|pg||
nt|yo_yo: and the @H finesse|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Here, too, coded @S lead (J denies) might let EW find the winning defense|pg||
nt|garnetts: Well I must say that I find double unbelievable unless it has a hidden meaning |pg||
nt|coch draig: wb all sry about that|pg||
pc|d7|nt|Walddk2: Bill Frisby and Marianne Harding|pg||
nt|marlowepi: e|pg||
nt|yo_yo: you prefer a @S overcall?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3C imprudent, could easily have pushed them there|pg||
nt|rodal f: Can u explain 1@H Stuart?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Transfer - shows @S|pg||
nt|rodal f: Thx Martin:)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i was just googling Belarus,  my ignorance is such I have never heard of it, it must be cold there too :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: lead  ok  but I dont like 4/3 fits|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  as said - -15 average in winter ))) 3 years ago, we have -30 nights and -20-24 days |pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: hi again everyone|pg||
pc|d3|nt|yo_yo: well, the second team is forging ahead|pg||
nt|coch draig: game in either major works here, 4@s easier though|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: north doesn't have much for the double|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: the only thing he has a lot of is losers :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: good evening :)|pg||
nt|athene: hey Hedy!|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|pg||
nt|yo_yo: and that's it|pg||
nt|yo_yo: well done operator!|pg||
nt|peachy: thanks for the highlights|pg||
nt|vugraphzgk: If I'd known you were watching I'd have gone slower!|pg||
nt|yo_yo: this is live now|pg||
nt|yo_yo: dont worry, we preferred it quick :)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: E is sure doing a lot of bidding with a 4 count albeit with a 7 bagger|pg||
nt|rodal f: E say: OK, I give up 3NT|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|garnetts: Yes by a lot actually |pg||
nt|yo_yo: sounds awful  sveta|pg||
pc|s5|nt|yo_yo: I prefer the overcall myself but there's support for all the unbid suits  so ok|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  matter of habit, Kath|pg||
nt|yo_yo: cant you move?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  not this year - right now we have -3 only - looks like Grand Daddy Frost relocated to GB this year|pg||
pc|d4|nt|snetram: not very nice partscore for NS|pg||
nt|athene: it could be worse - could be doubled|pg||
nt|rodal f: A naturell X and 2NT lebensol|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d9|nt|snetram: right - passive pass by E|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h8|nt|athene: east was quite kind i think - his partner has to have something for 2@H vul against not |pg||
pc|hA|nt|mcarroll: This is not going to be a success|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|garnetts: You can always back in later if it feels prudent|pg||
pc|sT|nt|athene: people often don't double with a very big trump stack because they are scared opps will run to a better spot|pg||
nt|athene: but that isn't much of a danger here|pg||
pc|s2|pc|c2|pc|s3|pg||
nt|coch draig: the defences problem here is they can't force declarer at all|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sK|nt|yo_yo: this has gone very well|pg||
pc|h6|pc|s4|pg||
pc|d5|nt|snetram: +100 looks like -1IMP, +300= +4IMP|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dA|pc|c4|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|yo_yo: maybe i should revise my opinion of moysian fits|pg||
