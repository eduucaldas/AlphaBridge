nt|athene: 4@S wouldn't have been fun for NS - west was just waiting to get his hands on that one|pg||
nt|ciaran: Hi all|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi Ciaran|pg||
mb|p|nt|james_h: Lets see if NS help/push EW to slam?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|james_h: Tom Hanlon takes matters into his own hands|pg||
nt|james_h: Given this start,I think south will definately sac in 6@s ... lets see|pg||
nt|mcarroll: How many @S from Hugh? 4 I guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: Hamman in his book castigated the jack-denies lead method. |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ..and hi William|pg||
mb|3D!|mb|p|nt|ciaran: Hi Martin|pg||
mb|4C|nt|mdgraham: Reckoned it gave declarer more help than it was worth |pg||
nt|chick: how high will NS go in @Ds?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: As ever with these thngs, the truth is somewhere near the middle|pg||
nt|chick: looks like 4 is the limit|pg||
nt|frankaus: this action quite a contrast to th OR|pg||
nt|vugraphzgh: PC technical problem with the CR NIBU NI match|pg||
nt|mdgraham: an enterprising 1@S overcall |pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|nt|mcarroll: And James is right if EW bid 6 they will find the save|pg||
nt|andyv:  this one will take some work|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: normal enough to reach 4major when you have a 5-4 fit and some shape|pg||
nt|andyv:  and some help which the @c lead does provide|pg||
nt|athene: but south's values aren't exactly where north wants them|pg||
mb|4H|nt|frankaus: 3NT here would be my choice aswell|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: duck a diamond|pg||
nt|james_h: whos buying?|pg||
mb|5D|nt|ciaran: Looks like an easy 4S or a thin 6S here which will fail due to both trump honours being offside|pg||
mb|p|mb|6S|nt|frankaus: 10 quickly|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: OK - me|pg||
nt|james_h: Martin is a great team player|pg||
nt|athene: east had better jump in with the @DA and switch to a spad|pg||
nt|athene: spade|pg||
nt|andyv:  difficult hand to declare... when N goes after @ds, the @s switch will be obvious|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  but E seems to be unaware of the danger to the hand|pg||
nt|athene: well it's very hard for east - he doesn't know anything about declarer's hand|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: needed to win diamond ace first time really..|pg||
nt|andyv:  but he does know he has no tricks in @ds and @cs... @s suit is only hope|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't think winning A of @d was all that difficult|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|d3|pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s2|nt|mdgraham: with the added advantage that the defence may not take the queen|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi Frank|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|ciaran: when the wind is in your sails, these contracts make - a little unlucky for Hamilton and Ferguson|pg||
pc|cT|nt|mcarroll: A bit unfortunate - the bidding looks reasonable, unlucky to find the trumps stacked. So first imps to CBAIlookk|pg||
pc|c4|nt|frankaus: 11 now & may take @H fin for 12|pg||
nt|chick: wish I knew what 3@H meant .. might be a clue to whether to finesse @Hs or not|pg||
nt|mdgraham: high card raise to 3@S, I suspect|pg||
pc|c6|nt|james_h: North needs to establish @d because he cant draw t and ruff, 3@c and 1@h|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|d8|nt|wilkinsona: best of fortune re exams..|pg||
nt|athene: even if you know that declarer has a singleton diamond, it might sometimes be right to duck - give declarer @SAxx for instance|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.camrosebridge.com/  for a website with lots of useful information|pg||
nt|athene: now rising the ace gives him pitches for both spades but if you duck he loses no diamond but two spades|pg||
nt|athene: but i agree it might have ben findable if east remembers his side needs FOUR tricks to beat this|pg||
nt|andyv:  as long as this isn't match points, rising with A of @d and switching to K of @s was called for. |pg||
pc|d5|nt|frankaus: Value raise of @S would be my guess|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d7|pg||
pc|s3|pc|c7|nt|chick: could it show something in hearts besides?|pg||
nt|frankaus: even 13 now on @H finn|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|pg||
pc|d2|nt|andyv:  N guessed right... he could have saved himself a headache by not cashing the Ace of @cs first|pg||

nt|rodal f: :)|pg||
nt|athene: you can be a lot more aggressive with hands like east's if you know it's a 4-4 fit|pg||
nt|andyv:  3 chances to make... slim, fat and none|pg||
nt|athene: maybe he expected 2@H to guarantee a 4th trump|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s6|pc|sK|pc|sT|pg||
nt|andyv:  some use 2N (this time it would be by E) to find out what quality of raise partner gave them... it would have helped this time|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yes E has assumed 4 hearts, and I think at least 3 diamonds and added a bit more as well|pg||
nt|athene: north has quite a lot of defensive cards not to double this|pg||
nt|athene: but his partner is a passed hand and he doesn't have any distributional surprises|pg||
nt|andyv:  but, E was a bit optomistic....2@h was already too high|pg||
nt|athene: and no-one forced east to bid game!|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ciaran: the defense can get a cross ruff going here for -3|pg||

nt|po-s: now South|pg||
nt|james_h: I'm sure|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: Good Pass|pg||
nt|andyv:  10 tricks will fall on S's lap|pg||
nt|andyv:  anyone here like not leading pd's suit?|pg||
nt|athene: it's sensible to not lead partner's suit if you have one of your own|pg||
nt|athene: but eschewing the spade lead with a doubleton, just for KQx, seems a bit weird|pg||
nt|andyv:  i agree|pg||
mb|2N|nt|frankaus: @H and this may suceed|pg||
nt|james_h: South must smell a rat as he likes to balance|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: E has an interesting problem here .... N didn't choose NT without a good stopper in @Hs|pg||
nt|chick: so is one of his black suits better chance to set?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that's a lead declarer didn't want to see  |pg||
nt|james_h: this is an EW implosion|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes they dont have the theoretical points required, but maybe they will take the view that 3NT may be as likely as 2?|pg||
nt|ciaran: Will probably stop in 2N and be thankful to make|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: may concern declarer though..|pg||
nt|andyv:  rule of 6 should have told declarer not to hold up|pg||

pc|cK|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|dK|nt|athene: perhaps there was a misunderstanding about the nature of 6@H here|pg||
nt|athene: east thought 5NT was asking for specific kings so 6@H denied one|pg||

mb|2H|nt|mcarroll: The Open Room must have crashed, so we are not getting comparisons, but they bid and made 4@S on this board|pg||
nt|ciaran: 2H is a good result for N/S since it looks like E/W will make 2S, though it might be hard to get into the auction|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|nt|athene: 2@S is the best they can do at this point i guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|ciaran: 2C from N forces 2D from S, and 2H is then to play|pg||

mb|3D|nt|athene: the EW intervention in the other room kept NS safe|pg||
nt|ciaran: Did well not to|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 2@S=good raise in clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzgh: x = raise to 2S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not sure of the wisdom of these canape overcalls |pg||
nt|chick: makes the second bid much easier in competition|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mdgraham: sure, if partner expects a canape |pg||
nt|ciaran: A much longer auction in the other room to reach the same contract|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c9|nt|james_h: There is too much sex going on up north these days, they should focus their minds on bridge|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mdgraham: but it could confuse the suit lengths|pg||
nt|chick: doesn't usually matter with 6-5 ... pard will have one of the two suits|pg||
nt|andyv:  N also opened 1@d in OR... made it easier for E to bid|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d3|pc|dK|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dT|nt|chick: what you say is right, Mike, but in cases like this, all you really want to do is make pard pick one of your two suits|pg||
nt|eamongall: Its not that James surely ... its lack of game time against players of EBU and Team Silver level |pg||
pc|dJ|pc|c3|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|james_h: I blame the non sectarian sex|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mdgraham: it will matter if partner is 2-2 in your suits, but that probably can't be the case here |pg||

pc|cA|nt|andyv:  yep|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h7|nt|mcarroll: and another couple of imps to NIBU|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
pc|cK|nt|athene: i mean ignoring the fact of this having no play anyway :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|mdgraham: as you would far rather be in a 6-2 fit than a 5-2 fit|pg||
nt|chick: If the 5-2 suit is trump and badly split, maybe yes, but I think most of the time, you will lose the same tricks in either contract.  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: rather thought South would get the diamonds right there |pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, you might get forced as well - as is being graphically demonstrated here |pg||
nt|athene: maybe he was hoping for some horrible defensive crash and a no-loser club suit|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: surprised he didnt|pg||
mb|p|nt|eamongall: what does the word " recidivist " mean ...I need to understand a spec comment |pg||
nt|mcarroll: Backsliding - repeat offender|pg||
nt|andyv:  N really wants to get in this one?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Wrong again|pg||
mb|5S|nt|chick: I'm surprised that W hasn't shown the spades yet|pg||
nt|james_h: Etymology: French récidiviste, from récidiver to relapse, from Middle French, from Medieval Latin recidivare, from Latin recidivus recurring, from recidere to fall back, from re- + ...|pg||

nt|ciaran: I'm sure both doubles implied 4H, but someone has to bid them..|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|sT|pc|s3|pg||
nt|athene: maybe north, knowing he has had a huge set, just wanted to avoid any possible risk|pg||
nt|athene: but i don't think that passing 2@H out is exactly safe|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yes, seems reasonable, this is only a couple of imps if its -1|pg||

mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|ppiglett: West didn't like defneding 2C doubled with the lure of the V game. More importantly too distributional. Note how he bid 2H!|pg||

mb|3S|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|ppiglett: 3Nt predicted. |pg||
