nt|eggy: The republic have a great record over recent years, England first team haven;t won for about 5 years, although the "B" team won last year|pg||
nt|jcmax: 2@C very much looks like transfer to @D|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|3C|nt|finch:  We saw last set that Price likes four-card overcalls and, as before, a good suit opposite a passed partner is a good time to do it|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: I think the holders ought to be allowed to defend their title as the 6th team|pg||
nt|jallerton: is this 5/5 or 6/4 in the minors, South wonders|pg||
nt|golfsquash: Why are there 2 teams from NI?|pg||
nt|jallerton: it's their turn|pg||
nt|eggy: They used to do that, but I think that as the same team kept winning it was rather getting rather expensive to win|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|golfsquash: It used to be the holders got 2 teams|pg||
nt|jcmax: ¤-card overcalls work well when partner doesn't punish you. Some partner just always jump to the 3-level with 4-card support. And then you are not so happy when you get doubled.|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|finch:  EW have played a lot together, and East knows his partner's proclivities|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|nt|jallerton: Simpson has avoided the 3-level|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|jcmax: Whether N's 3@C should be 5/5 or 6/4 is a very good question. Should 2NT be natural in this sequence?|pg||
nt|jallerton: 2NT sounds natural to me|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s8|pc|sQ|pc|s7|pg||
pc|sK|nt|jcmax: Maybe, but one might also double 2@S with a "natural" 2NT bid.|pg||
nt|finch:  Declarer should get clubs right, as he can pick up Qx in East's hand but not in West's|pg||
nt|jallerton: but perhaps he should double for t/o with 6-4|pg||
pc|c2|pc|s4|pc|s9|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h2|pg||
nt|jcmax: I would expect a doubleton heart for a take-out double|pg||
nt|finch:  Although given he needs clubs 3-3 that was a slightly silly comment|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d9|pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
pc|dT|nt|jallerton: Fair enough, Sabine, but there is room for 2NT "scramble" over a double|pg||
nt|jcmax: Well, East should have something for his 2@H call. :) Or did it say: partner I have a bad raise?|pg||
nt|finch:  With the spade honours placed in West's hand, East needs the @CQ to make up a cue bid, I think|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d4|pc|dQ|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|h6|pc|d5|pc|h7|pg||

nt|finch:  Declarer's problem is that he thinks spades are 5-3, which probably makes 3-3 clubs unlikely|pg||
nt|jcmax: I agree, Jeffrey, there is room for that. But my partners usually don't scramble with 3622 distribution :)|pg||
