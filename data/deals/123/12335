mb|1H|nt|garnetts: tough hand all round here par seems to be a save in 6@S |pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: http://www.camrosebridge.com/  for a website with lots of useful information|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|snetram: agressive again|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|hedyg: NS play very weak weak|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Kvangraven is known to bid every time he has 13 cards|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hamilton likes that response|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: the hand is not really worth an overcall followed by a double. but i like immediate double even less.|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Hi Marshall|pg||
nt|garnetts: I would have bid on the South hand--especially since partner has passed|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but i assume you would overcall|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mcarroll: There are possibilities to make this|pg||
pc|cT|nt|athene: 4@S is very pushy |pg||
nt|rodal f: 6-9 and 5@H+ I belive|pg||
pc|c2|nt|hedyg: best defense would be @C lead and 10@d by S|pg||
nt|snetram: i am not agree with 2@H opening. Bad bridge - A,K and weak suit ( 5332)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: some like a few point to overcall |pg||
pc|c4|nt|hedyg: but that is totally DD|pg||

pc|s3|pc|s6|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Walddk2: Maybe not any more|pg||
nt|hedyg: not if gets to disc a @d on @H and ruff a @D|pg||
nt|athene: south didn't anticipate that declarer might have two heart tricks :) his partner has to have a pretty bad suit for that to happen :)|pg||

pc|d6|nt|garnetts: one off rather than two |pg||
nt|yo_yo: better one down than making :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: but is off for sure--more risky if it might give the contract|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i hate that look on partner's face when it makes|pg||
nt|marlowepi: is that worse than the look on teammates faces?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgj: N closed board to ask east about W's pass in bidding|pg||

nt|Walddk2: First you have to bid 3NT, and then make it|pg||
nt|chick: but still a 2-point spread|pg||
nt|garnetts: so what--he wants to have his cake and eat it|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ah it was DOPI|pg||
nt|yo_yo: pass showing 1 key card|pg||
nt|marlowepi: seems odd that internationalists would not have an agreement about handling interference over 4N. is this a new partnership or something?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D!|mb|1S|nt|garnetts: Like much of what I see today--in my view if North wants an adjustment he should employ a chiropractor|pg||
mb|2N|nt|yo_yo: i wouldnt have an agreement about the final pass  but yes over 4NT  |pg||
mb|p|mb|3C!|mb|p|nt|garnetts: Good lead for declarer here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i doubt thatthe final pass was the issue|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|garnetts: close between small and the Q |pg||
nt|mcarroll: at least they avoided the 4-4 @S fit|pg||
pc|sK|nt|hedyg: 1NT is a constructive bid|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|s8|pg||
pc|sA|nt|snetram: NS pay at least 500 in any contract|pg||
nt|athene: surprising to pass 2nt there with two aces and two potentially useful tens|pg||
pc|s4|nt|athene: after his 4@S last board|pg||
nt|hedyg: he already bid his hand when he bid 1NT|pg||
pc|d5|pc|s6|pg||
nt|athene: north dodged a bullet, doubling rather than overcalling 1nt - that might have led to a lot of trouble for NS|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I suppose this happens when you open a featureless 11 count|pg||
pc|s7|nt|hedyg: 1NT should show 8-10|pg||
nt|chick: both tens are in suits that W doesn't have, so they may not be worth much|pg||
pc|s5|nt|chick: same with the length in @Ds|pg||
pc|c2|pc|s9|pg||
pc|d8|nt|rodal f: Norwegian specs will tell me if I'm wrong. Belive it's still 6 cup rounds before the final are to be played. At 3rd round the best teams play there first cup match. |pg||
nt|athene: i would say both tens are working quite hard|pg||
nt|chick: he has almost nothing to help set up tricks in W's suits|pg||
nt|athene: give partner nothing in diamonds and just the jack in spades for instance|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d7|nt|athene: @S10 and @D10 both help to give you a double stopper|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|c4|nt|snetram: typical auction - 1@S - X -pas - 2@D - X - pas...|pg||
nt|garnetts: odd play surely |pg||
pc|c5|pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c6|nt|chick: but do nothing to actually establish a source of tricks|pg||

pc|dJ|nt|garnetts: Not sure how good it is as a %age|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ok laydown at trick 3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: depends on lead as to how good it is. diamond leads hurts the a priori %|pg||
nt|yo_yo: simpson is treading carefully here, no  jump to 2@H|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|athene: you put the jack in right away to find if the finesse is on|pg||

nt|yo_yo: fast arrival  says no slam?|pg||

nt|yo_yo: that sounds great (if it means that )|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|athene: you don't want to run it round to the ace and then finesse because if it lost opps could cash and you would be worse off|pg||
pc|d8|pc|h6|nt|yo_yo: I wouldnt be confident with my partners|pg||
nt|garnetts: Now what is the best way to play clubs?   Take a finesse and play for the drop or cash the ace first?|pg||

mb|p|mb|3C!|nt|copeyj: have no idea what made Simpson open 1NT 3rd in unfavourable - looks like a fairly cruddy 14 count imo|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but he is in scotland now kath|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: you mean he is on the whisky?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: cruddy   - a new word to me|pg||
mb|3H|nt|chick: not for opening bids, but when forced to start at a higher level, like here, yes|pg||
nt|athene: very ugly to force yourself to 5@H|pg||
nt|garnetts: Well I am suprised that everyone got there--not enough grit I hear--not sure if that was meant to describe road conditions or the UK workforce|pg||
nt|copeyj: additionally i wld have led a trump here|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I wonder who is thinking?|pg||
nt|rodal f: A board for presission and/or relays|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgj: i have to wait for the tray to pass through to see what the other side has bid, so thats why there is delay|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S!|mb|p|nt|hedyg: would have been nice to be able to bid 4@d over 3@d for majors|pg||
nt|rodal f: Iwas nearly shure it was Martin but obviously not:)|pg||
mb|4C!|nt|mcarroll: Yes thats why I wondered who is thinking, S has nothing to think about so it is probablyW|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|garnetts: I agree a trump looks normal |pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|nt|mcarroll: Pass of the Dbl shows 1st round control?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Normaly RD. Belive pass was for give E space if he had more info to give since 3@C@S looks as relays|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mcarroll: So after all that a flat board|pg||
pc|sT|nt|copeyj: partner has doubled 2@S for penalties and i have QX and a substandard 1N opener|pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: well if you are going to just treat west as "majors" and not try to emphasise the longer hearts, you might as well bid 3@S then 4@H?|pg||
pc|s9|nt|copeyj: must stop them ruffing|pg||
nt|rodal f: 1@H normaly show 2-3controls so any problem for W to try 4NT?|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h5|pc|hQ|nt|hedyg: they might have 1@d-2@d as majors, here 4@d probably shows @c fit|pg||

nt|copeyj: heading for down 2|pg||

nt|chick: the trouble with something like neg double, or 4D for majors, is that partner will expect 4-4 type of hand and won't get excited with a 3 card major. with 6-5, I personally prefer ...|pg||
nt|chick: to bid the suits|pg||
nt|copeyj: west is dummy|pg||
nt|copeyj: and has lost the plot|pg||

nt|copeyj: with his partner's failure to cash out for 2 down|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 5 a.m. everywhere|pg||

mb|p|nt|marlowepi: not bad on a heart lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Still it's a endplay to make at E|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pc|c8|pg||
pc|h7|nt|hedyg: pd opened 1@H, maybe he would have found the @d switch|pg||
pc|h3|nt|athene: cashing two trumps not a good idea surely?|pg||
nt|hedyg: not a good idea at all|pg||
nt|athene: now the defence can draw a third trump and stop the diamond ruff|pg||
nt|marlowepi: K of D seems clear|pg||
nt|yo_yo: does it?  I would lead @C|pg||
nt|marlowepi: plenty of time for clubs later, such as a club lead by W|pg||
pc|h9|nt|hedyg: just cash your @ss and disc a @d and play @d|pg||
nt|athene: just bash out @SAKQ and play diamonfds|pg||
nt|hedyg: our thanks to Markus Bruno, our talented operator in Kristiansand!to my excellent fellow commentators Cornelia Yoder, Krzysztof Martens, Bill Frisby , Frank Rodal and of course ...|pg||

nt|hedyg: was instrumental in organising this broadcast.|pg||
nt|garnetts: K@D best I think|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dT|pc|dA|nt|yo_yo: Fergie finds the best lead here|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|rodal f: Clean @C and 3 rounds @H. @D to A last @H If no ruff u play @D|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Ah an opportunity for NIBU to narrow the gap|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h4|pc|d4|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not sure that trump wasnt better|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|nt|yo_yo: but not the best discard|pg||
nt|marlowepi: now queen of D and 3 rounds of spades|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not the best anything actually --starting with the opening lead where a trump seemed obvious and also a a double of 4@S too|pg||

nt|yo_yo: not easy to play or defend|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if u double u will be -590|pg||
nt|yo_yo: who would double?|pg||

nt|cliveo: Perhaps this is another sensible auction on a different hand!|pg||
nt|athene: this is a hand from the previous set|pg||
nt|cliveo: As there is no play in progress it might be interesting to reflect on what has happened so far, I thought Holland and Brunner who are representing England for the third successive ...|pg||
nt|cliveo: year were on top form in defence last night|pg||
nt|po-s: Who is leading this event?|pg||
nt|cliveo: England|pg||
nt|cliveo: Nothern Ireland are in second and Scotland third|pg||
nt|cliveo: after the first round|pg||
mb|1N!|mb|p|nt|garnetts: very unuusual but an adverse save pays here|pg||
mb|3N|nt|Walddk7: Another term stolen from cricket, as is the case for hat-trick|pg||
nt|garnetts: North might have bid 4@C rather than 4@S to suggest a lead |pg||
nt|mdgraham: Good afternoon all|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: The play will not be taxing |pg||
nt|garnetts: In fact can claim 11 right now|pg||

nt|Vugraphzgj: lets hope that 32 is the same as the board on the table|pg||
nt|rodal f: U're forgive Stuart my son:)|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|Walddk2: *around|pg||
mb|1H!|nt|yo_yo: that bidding may not be correct, i think the operator is concentrating on the results|pg||
nt|athene: this is the last board from previous set so we are getting there :)|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Exactly what can happen when you don't split the files into two of 16|pg||
nt|Walddk7: We emphasize that in our guidelines|pg||
nt|cliveo: That's right, the board was played in 3 @S +1 for a flat board|pg||
nt|athene: i see in the other room NIBU has changed their pair; certainly they had a rough time last set, letting through a few too many no-play contracts|pg||
nt|po-s: it increases the chances to find the right contracts|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Stuart, you may as well shut down. This leads to no good|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Fine the person who is in charge and let him/her sort it out|pg||
nt|Walddk7: >Nothing can be done with the table up|pg||

nt|yo_yo: and the @H finesse|pg||

mb|3H|nt|Walddk2: Bill Frisby and Marianne Harding|pg||
nt|marlowepi: e|pg||
nt|yo_yo: you prefer a @S overcall?|pg||
