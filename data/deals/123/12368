nt|roswolf: this is just a question fo staying low|pg||
nt|garnetts: Watched this next door and a complex relay sequence took ten minutes to bid |pg||
nt|garnetts: I reckon my late Granny would have taken three bids and twent seconds |pg||
nt|garnetts: twenty even|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes but the science worked after a fashion|pg||
nt|garnetts: 1@S  3@S  4@S |pg||
nt|roswolf: yes simple stuff|pg||
nt|roswolf: have the players gone to sleep|pg||
mb|1D|nt|Vugraphzgk: very slow connection|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgk: I'm so good!|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgk: Norma in closed room - I think Ying in open|pg||
nt|garnetts: The only lead with the potential to hold it to 10 tricks is a low heart leaving a guess for declarer|pg||
mb|1S|nt|iain sime: Good result for Scotland in the other room, but I expect Wales should bid the slam as well.|pg||
mb|2D|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|iain sime: They play transfer responses. |pg||
nt|xenya: in the other room N got in with 1@S -- as here|pg||
nt|athene: 2@D shows hearts; i would have expected north to bid 3@H there|pg||
nt|yo_yo: does it show @H?|pg||
mb|3H|nt|iain sime: 1D showed hearts.|pg||
nt|xenya: that led to a lively auction -- here too|pg||
nt|roswolf: a bergen type sequence|pg||
nt|garnetts: Well I would have thought perhaps 3NT would be a more descriptive bid after 3@D |pg||
nt|Vugraphzgk: VERY slow connection sorry|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@D LOOKS ROUTINE NOW|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.camrosebridge.com/  for standings, convention cards and other useful information|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i wouldnt have thought so|pg||
mb|p|nt|iain sime: Wow. That will test their Blackwood over interference.|pg||
nt|eggy: 3@H looks a slight underbid on LTC|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: looks just right to me|pg||
nt|eggy: I can't imagine that EW will get their signals wrong here|pg||
nt|athene: well if they reach 4@H i think west has a fairly comfortable double and diamond lead|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d3|nt|iain sime: So Scotland have a good gain here for bidding slam in both rooms.|pg||

nt|iain sime: Good morning Ian.|pg||
pc|d5|nt|eggy: What do I know?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|roswolf: should be a push|pg||

nt|mdgraham: that might have been more difficult if NS could have made North declarer via some three- or four-level transfer mechanism |pg||
nt|brolucius: Ireland are playing NI-2, who have not been scoring particularly heavily in their other matches, so it will be a near miracle if England make up 4 VPs on the last round.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|2H!|nt|brolucius: Simpson cannot keep quiet for ever.|pg||
mb|d!|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Presumably an immediate double would have been conventional.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, it shows spades and another suit.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: looks like Price took that as penalties? |pg||
pc|dA|nt|brolucius: Ireland are actually playing Wales, I am told. That's right, they played NI-2 in the previous match. My mistake.|pg||

nt|eggy: With 3 trumps?|pg||
nt|brolucius: They must know what a delayed double means, surely.|pg||
nt|copeyj: Delayed x for them is "i would have doubled 1NT for penalties"|pg||
nt|eggy: although it is a bit surprising that he didn';t bid 2S whatever he thought it was|pg||
nt|brolucius: I guess it is 'strong balanced'. You could not have it as take-out in case you happened to hold length there.|pg||
nt|dagold: good Afternoon all|pg||
nt|eggy: NS play 1NT x aas @S and  another|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Good afternoon David, welcome|pg||
nt|eggy: so a double here should be a good hand you'd think|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cT|pc|cK|pc|c2|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sQ|nt|dagold: i know they play double as a hand which would double 1nt|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s4|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|brolucius: Simpson crosses to partner's hand with a club in case declarer has Q-10 remaining in the spade suit.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|dagold: Price's pass is a gamble|pg||
pc|s6|pc|h3|pg||
nt|mdgraham: perhaps North fancies a bit of payback after board 1.|pg||
nt|dagold: which is fairly typical of this pair|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h7|nt|eggy: looks like N will get his HT promoted, |pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
nt|eggy: or not|pg||
nt|brolucius: Not now. He needed to play a club instead of a trump.|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h5|pc|hT|nt|eggy: S would have had to read the club shape, but perhaps that wasn't too awkward|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|brolucius: Now declarer can ruff one of dummy's clubs for only one down.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Did N/S have a game available? I didn't look.|pg||
mc|7|nt|dagold: 4 spades maybe|pg||

nt|mdgraham: perhaps @DJ might have been better at trick one|pg||
nt|roswolf: we are of one mind david|pg||
nt|garnetts: Maybe 4@C was Gerber  :)  |pg||
nt|athene: wow, that was some pass of the double from north in the other room|pg||
nt|yo_yo: they are having fun in the open room!|pg||
nt|athene: maybe misunderstanding?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|yo_yo: ah it was indeed|pg||
mb|d|nt|mdgraham: always easier in hindsight|pg||
nt|roswolf: sshhhhh G is a bbo proscribed convention|pg||
mb|2H|nt|garnetts: Even for the Scottish team ?   |pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w may get too hifg now|pg||
mb|p|nt|iain sime: On Board 1 In the other room after a similar start South bid only 5S. |pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: seems normal so far |pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|garnetts: I assume that West will pass|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgk: connection seems OK for now|pg||
nt|roswolf: good news:)|pg||
nt|garnetts: South might double but I would pass|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgk: lots of questions being asked and answered|pg||
nt|garnetts: maybe they should listen to the bidding I understand it |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good morning to Ian Cowper|pg||
nt|roswolf: on this auction  seems understandable to me|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not often I can say that on here either |pg||
nt|andyv:  E certainly seemed to like his hand in the OR on Board 1|pg||
nt|athene: now south has a fairly easy double if it's t/o|pg||
nt|athene: if it's penalties he is stuck (as you usually are when double is penalties)|pg||
mb|3D|nt|jackthelad: morning all :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi Ian|pg||
nt|garnetts: Good morning Ian I was just recommending Gerber to the Scottish team |pg||
nt|roswolf: interEsting 2@S CID|pg||
nt|jackthelad: I noticed the "G" word, and baulked|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: West must pass here  |pg||
nt|andyv:  must have been for penalties|pg||
nt|athene: he tried to get unstuck with 3@D but this won't be so much fun|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: two very good  decisions at a high level by the Scots -- boards 1 and 15|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: FINIS I HOPE|pg||
nt|garnetts: I think East should be able to hand this --I have to say I would have doubled it |pg||
pc|cT|nt|roswolf: sorry for the shout but the keyboard is frozen|pg||
pc|c3|nt|eamongall: this is the weaker side of the Carrot @C |pg||
nt|eggy: I think East was playing n for a pretty thin raise as well|pg||
nt|eamongall: holland will hardly move in |pg||
nt|eggy: Although Holland rarely declines invitations|pg||
nt|garnetts: I can hardly imagine Victor Goldberg letting 3@S go |pg||
nt|roswolf: yes n/s seem to have put their head into the noose|pg||
pc|c6|nt|eamongall: possible 6 tricks for defence on first principles |pg||
nt|garnetts: He was a tough handful at the table |pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|d5|nt|eggy: Obviously Holland wasn't thinking, it was just the link going down|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d4|nt|roswolf: this looks -1 at least|pg||
nt|jackthelad: all seems pretty reasonable, and cant really be more than -1|pg||
nt|garnetts: True  but quite a lucky lie for NS --unenamoured of the 2@S bid and the 3@S bid too|pg||
nt|jackthelad: difference between Victor and Brian is rubber...Victor played stakes, Brian never did|pg||
nt|garnetts: strikes me that if East ha s bid and west reversed that partner has a poor overcall --maybe 2@S initially |pg||
pc|h3|nt|xenya: perhaps winning the Ace followed by a @S back would have been better|pg||
nt|athene: maybe north should bid 3@C over 2@H|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|roswolf: fair point|pg||
pc|d3|nt|xenya: now S is sort of endplayed|pg||
nt|jackthelad: awkward for the defence to organise their trix now|pg||
pc|s3|nt|garnetts: Yes Ian most of the best players have in my view enjoyed the money game |pg||
pc|s5|nt|eggy: Although Simpson prottected a similar auction with 2NT recently|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|andyv:  It seems like N had a pretty easy 2@s bid over 2@h|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h4|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|athene: shouldn't that show more than four spades?|pg||
pc|c9|nt|xenya: still it's down 1 but a 2-imp loss|pg||
pc|c7|nt|Walddk4: http://www.camrosebridge.com/  for a website with lots of useful information|pg||
nt|xenya: strictly speaking, declarer could always get out for -1, but NS made his task easier|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c4|pc|cK|nt|eamongall: possible 6 tricks for defence on first principles ...just b4 table crash|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the advisability of such an action depends heavily on the result|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|andyv:  was dbl for penalty?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: This hand is a violation of Burn's Law |pg||
nt|athene: pass was ok; you just have to play X as t/o here|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d8|pc|s4|pc|hT|pg||

nt|eggy: Holland deciding to play 2 of a major, |pg||

nt|yo_yo: cappelletti again|pg||
nt|athene: west will presumably back in with 2@S over 2@D anyway|pg||
nt|yo_yo: n|pg||
nt|andyv:  you could agree to still play Lebensold in that position... then 2@s is simple competitive and doesn't guarantee more than 4.|pg||
nt|yo_yo: no|pg||
nt|athene: even if east passes it|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i think john might compete though|pg||
nt|athene: it's easy to have misunderstandings over what east's double of 2@D would mean|pg||
nt|athene: since it's a pass or correct bid|pg||
nt|athene: best is to treat them as natural so double is whatever double of a natural 2@D would be there|pg||
nt|athene: which is of course another issue :) as usual i say it should be t/o|pg||
mb|2D|mb|d|nt|xenya: @C slam NS -- might be hard to bid though -- we'll see|pg||
mb|p|nt|eamongall: this is some kind of drop dead stayman|pg||
nt|yo_yo: might it not show 5@H and 4@S?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|xenya: the 3@C bid could help them to achieve that|pg||
nt|eggy: Presumably Brunner is not allowed to open with2254 shape|pg||
nt|athene: maybe the huge delay was north wondering what system they play as a passed hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|eggy: If he decided to move, I expect their agreement requires preference|pg||
mb|p|nt|eamongall: can show 5@H and 4@S but who cares when dropping a few 50s on low high card points |pg||
nt|garnetts: why not let North in easily?   Verbal nonsense to bid 4@D ---is a slam really likely ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jackthelad: yes...quick agreement was necessary to get to 6|pg||
nt|athene: the point being, you have double available to show something funky, so you might change your methods a little bit|pg||
nt|yo_yo: maybe Norma could tell us if North was thinking|pg||
pc|d3|nt|Vugraphzgk: yes - N thinking hard|pg||

pc|d2|pc|dT|nt|iain sime: No problem. Another slam swing to Scotland it seems.|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|iain sime: After a reverse, most common these days is for agreement of any of opener's suits is game forcing.|pg||

nt|yo_yo: looks like the right NT range to me|pg||

nt|andyv:  13 imps to England|pg||
nt|yo_yo: england zoom into the lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: this looks like a straightforard n/s game|pg||
mb|p|nt|eggy: or perhaps it's just their preference|pg||
mb|1C|nt|garnetts: might be able to push them or maybe South will get too excited |pg||

nt|Vugraphzgk: she's thinking hard|pg||
nt|roswolf: eventually|pg||
nt|garnetts: never pays to think at this game in the bidding |pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: One of the reasons i gave up the weak notrump is to avoid having to open 1@S on hands like this |pg||
mb|1S|nt|eamongall: this is an easy 12 tricks ... next thing is ... 4@H 5@H 6@H or heaven forbid 7@H|pg||

mb|3D|nt|xenya: it also looks like we are stuck again|pg||
nt|eamongall: 7@Hs out due to opening pass ...I guess ...|pg||
nt|eamongall: and eddieirl just told me as well |pg||
nt|athene: some people might consider passing 1@S with that east hand|pg||
nt|athene: but it's right to raise if you have four trumps |pg||
mb|p|nt|eamongall: theres a double for a @C lead and another for a @D lead |pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: the Scots managed to get to 7@H|pg||
nt|eamongall: I don't like 4@Hs ... but I don't know the Carrot @C either|pg||
nt|mdgraham: maybe shows good hearts in context and not much else |pg||
nt|eggy: Even if the diamonds were switched, I don;t think the entries are enough for 7H are they?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: and so did NI, flat board  one down|pg||
nt|eamongall: JComyn tells me 7@Hs is still in the pipeline but I would be thinking 6@Hs may not even be reached at this stage |pg||
nt|yo_yo: has McGann showed @H support yet?|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is in some jeopardy|pg||
mb|4S|nt|mdgraham: difficult to see what East can do over 4@S|pg||
nt|eamongall: is 2N showing @H supp or is it showing the strong balanced 1@C hand |pg||
nt|eggy: depends what it means I suppose|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: obviously you must raise if partner could have such an enormous hand|pg||
nt|athene: unless you really don't have your response|pg||
nt|andyv:  wonder what 3@d was about|pg||
nt|athene: if east had done something exciting over 3@D (like 4@S) maybe west would have gone on|pg||
pc|hK|nt|yo_yo: whatever it was John Holland wasnt interested|pg||
nt|athene: but she is missing a lot of aces and trumps - slam looks way off|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|nt|roswolf: looks like -1 to me|pg||
nt|jackthelad: 3 loosers, and nowhere to go|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|eggy: from the alerts, perhaps it's all relays|pg||
nt|athene: asking partner to have @SKQ and a red ace is very optimistic|pg||
nt|andyv:  so seems the luck of chosing 3@d (instead of 3@h) may have kept them out of slam?|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|eamongall: ok then ...4@S is GS try so ...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, apart from that :) |pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|nt|athene: perhaps she was probing for 3nt|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|athene: intending to pass that if east bid it|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s8|pc|s9|nt|Walddk7: This board was flat in the Scotland-N Ireland match, but I don't think you can guess how|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|athene: it might be safer than 4@S if spades break badly|pg||
nt|andyv:  in either case, the play will be over quickly|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes claim if he doesnt cash |pg||
nt|athene: or maybe she was worried about east having only three spades - but with only three spades AND a diamond stop east would surely bid 1nt rather than 2@S|pg||
pc|s7|nt|andyv:  somehow when you have 2 stiffs, 3N is not the place that comes to mind to play|pg||
pc|sT|nt|eamongall: we know it was 7@Hs flat |pg||
nt|Walddk7: no|pg||
nt|eamongall: down 1 flat |pg||
nt|Walddk7: One went down in 6@H, one in 7@H|pg||

nt|roswolf: hmm must have ruffed low|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgk: yes - then a flurry of cards and muttering|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: indeed -- mind you EW have done nothing wrong -- actually they have played quite well|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Look at the East hand closely|pg||

mb|p|nt|eggy: I am surprised that Bridge doesn't get larger crowds ...|pg||

nt|athene: well, now we know the borderline between opening and passing, for West|pg||

pc|d9|nt|henryb: South has the sort of hand that even SL Simon recommended opening a prepared 1@c|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jackthelad: good point Roland|pg||
nt|iain sime: it has been good bridge in this room. If Wales had got the slam hands right in the open the score would be 2-4.|pg||

pc|d5|nt|yo_yo: NI opened 1@H and got to 4|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|athene: when you have to develop a suit like the diamonds here with only one dummy entry you have to decide which hand has the doubleton honour|pg||
nt|athene: if east has it you lead from hand first; if west has it you finesse from dummy first|pg||
nt|yo_yo: no smith peter from Michelle,  Holland will switch|pg||
pc|h9|nt|Walddk4: If you think about it for a little while, 3NT is probably the right bid with that hand|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|athene: now he might burn his bridges? spade to the ace and run the ten, playing west for @DKQ?|pg||
nt|athene: that would be playing the @DK for a falsecard, but it doesn't do to believe opps in these situations|pg||
nt|andyv:  his bridges seemed burnt some time ago:)|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d7|nt|brolucius: I see that a director's ruling gave Ireland 3 VPs extra in their penultimate match, so they led ENgland by 7 VPs. Now the score are level at 95 VPs each, if the scores stay as they ...|pg||

nt|athene: people spend all their time trying to find every major suit fit under the sun|pg||
mb|p|nt|eggy: 9 even|pg||
nt|garnetts: 2NT is not good with AK A in my view and weak heart suit double is better |pg||
nt|henryb: Now I would play that as minors|pg||
nt|athene: and they can't find even a 6-5 fit in a minor :(|pg||

nt|yo_yo: is it possible to find the @C fit?  Not easy|pg||

nt|yo_yo: would anyone move?  I dont think so|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@c opener just to awkward for these hands|pg||

nt|andyv:  K@d is protected... so 6@c should be easy now|pg||
nt|yo_yo: go greer|pg||
nt|athene: north knows his partner presumably has a 4-card major so he has lots of shape|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|nt|athene: lots of shape + big fit + all the controls = slam|pg||

mb|3H|nt|yo_yo: 2@D looks like asptro|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it makes sense to use your normal defence to an opening Multi 2@D against this kind of overcall|pg||
mb|p|nt|eggy: or transfer|pg||
nt|mdgraham: (assuming it is one major, not Astro or some variant)|pg||
nt|andyv:  E almost has a 4@h bid here|pg||
mb|4H|nt|jackthelad: 2@c is probably stronger than 2@s, so result could be the same|pg||
nt|athene: also why won't they make it? even with @HQ and @SK wrong you only have three obvious losers - maybe you run out of tricks|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|garnetts: ood isn't EW can make 3NT |pg||

mb|p|pc|cQ|pc|c6|pc|c4|nt|yo_yo: @S and another|pg||
nt|garnetts: Minimum for me--start with a double with a decent hand or cue one of there suits |pg||

nt|garnetts: How hard was it to play the Q@D?  |pg||
pc|sK|pg||

pc|cK|nt|roswolf: impossible it looks like|pg||
pc|c2|nt|xenya: might need careful defence to beat it though|pg||
nt|iain sime: trump best.|pg||
nt|jackthelad: why I think the 2@s in the other room was better....at least gave a chance of missing it...also loosing trick count in E is ugly|pg||

nt|garnetts: I was thinking he might do that |pg||
nt|yo_yo: 3 losers but where are the winners|pg||
pc|c7|nt|vugraphzgk: small delay due to a bathroom break|pg||

nt|Walddk7: And not needed as all CCs are available|pg||

nt|yo_yo: it's been interesting|pg||
mc|10|nt|eggy: West should play a spade after the club I think, to cater for the HJ in South's hand|pg||
nt|eamongall: I have spotted Denmark on BBO sometimes and ...impartial |pg||

mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3C!|mb|p|nt|brolucius: This is the famous 'Marc Smith auction', where he reaches 3NT with 11 opposite 11.|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Ah, they have a method to stop in 3@D.|pg||
nt|eggy: which is a touch more successful that Price Simpson it seems|pg||
pc|sT|nt|dagold: What is going on here?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I reckon Mr Gold should make a firm comment about not trying this auction at home, either|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|nt|eggy: :)|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c6|pc|cK|nt|brolucius: The problem with rebidding 2NT on (11)12-14 is that responder cannot make a game try with 11.|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|Walddk1: It's Acol bidding, David, very accurate|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c9|pc|cQ|nt|brolucius: Not Acol at all!! Of course not.|pg||
nt|Walddk1: LIke 1@H all pass in the previous set|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cT|pc|d7|pc|c5|pg||
nt|brolucius: The weak 1NT avoids the problem. It is four-card majors, alongside the strong 1NT, which forces it.|pg||

pc|s5|pc|hK|pc|h9|pc|d3|pg||
nt|brolucius: One solution is to pass on the duff 11-count, since opener is more likely to have 12 points than 13, may have 11 points and is least likely to have 14 points.|pg||
nt|Walddk1: How does that avoid any problem when you have to bid 2/1 with a dubious 9 count in case partner has a strong notrump?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: absolutley, David|pg||
nt|Walddk1: It's a typical Acol flaw|pg||
nt|brolucius: Because the opener does not rebid 2NT on a weak NT type. He can rebid his five-card major.|pg||
nt|dagold: Brunner inded went on to 4@h on board 13|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|pc|hJ|nt|Walddk1: If he has one|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|hT|nt|eggy: I was unaware that Acol obliges you to bid at the 2 level with a dubious 9 count, whatever the other drawbacks|pg||
pc|d9|nt|mdgraham: NI found 6@C on board 12|pg||
pc|dA|pc|h7|pg||
nt|brolucius: You have to open a prepared 1@C if you play the strong 1NT. Not a 4-card major.|pg||
nt|Walddk1: It does if you play weak NT, Steve|pg||

nt|eamongall: I can see my polar bear (westie) outside in the 5 cm of snow |pg||
mb|p|nt|iain sime: This is the second match of the first of two Camrose weekends. last night scotland had a 16-14 win against the Republic of Ireland.|pg||
nt|iain sime: Wales lost their first match 9-21 to England.|pg||
nt|xenya: N can bid 4@S straight away or 4@C -- jump fit, if available -- would be nice here|pg||
mb|2C|nt|iain sime: 4 Clubs is a good bid- partner will likely be on lead.|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: hi everyone|pg||
nt|eamongall: good afternoon Kath |pg||
nt|eamongall: good afternoon Mike |pg||

mb|p|nt|yo_yo: hello everyone   welcome to Manchester vs Belfast :)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|xenya: 5@S is a good save -- in the jaws of unfavourable vulnerabilty|pg||

nt|yo_yo: apart from ...... |pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|h5|nt|xenya: nicely done by N -- 5@D is cold|pg||

nt|dagold: Well done to NI on finding 6@c on 12|pg||
nt|brolucius: The wonderful dream has collapsed in just a few minutes and been replaced by something quite different.|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|2S|mb|3H|nt|brolucius: A club, against a spade contract, consumes a natural trump trick, but there are still four losers.|pg||

nt|brolucius: Ireland now 5 VPs ahead and coasting.|pg||
nt|dagold: often the way on these fit hands|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|c4|nt|eggy: which is likely to be the most EW will bid|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|brolucius: Well, the recovery was good while it lasted. They could not work miracles (like our cricket team in SA have done.)|pg||
nt|eggy: still perhaps they can beat that too|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h5|pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||

nt|brolucius: No, sorry, I misread the auction. He did have his bid.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Thanks for watching!|pg||
nt|eggy: No- but perhaps he thought thay may make spades|pg||

nt|yo_yo: have we one of Greer and Hastings then?|pg||
nt|athene: NS might get pushed to 3@H here and that should be -1|pg||
nt|athene: as long as declarer isn't allowed to throw a diamond on a club|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Does Michelle open 11 counts vulnerable?|pg||
nt|athene: she might open some eleven counts but i wouldn't open that one when i have to open it 1nt|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 5 card suit  she might|pg||
mb|1N|nt|eamongall: I wish people who kibitz here would not use sick words .... edawl |pg||
nt|mdgraham: they might get to game there, at the other table|pg||
nt|roswolf: this has more bite|pg||
mb|2C|nt|yo_yo: there we go|pg||
mb|2N|nt|eggy: but best to defend from either side, given the layout I think|pg||
mb|d|nt|mdgraham: South has a good hand, but it's a bit quacky|pg||
nt|eggy: West has great potential opposite the "right" heart hand, but this isn't it|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@H coming?|pg||
nt|eggy: He may be more ambitious than that I suppose|pg||
nt|athene: 2NT standard lebensohl i guess|pg||
nt|yo_yo: lebensohl in action by John Holland|pg||
nt|andyv:  gm Bill, Kath and all|pg||
nt|athene: intending to follow with 3@S, invitational|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hi andy|pg||
nt|athene: (because with spades and no game interest east could just bid 2@S over 2@C)|pg||
mb|3C|nt|eamongall: holland has no  reason not to pass |pg||
mb|3H|nt|eggy: North may phantom here, although i don't thinks it's right|pg||
nt|eamongall: oops|pg||
mb|3S|nt|Vugraphzgk: Sorry - connection probs|pg||
nt|garnetts: There were a few technichal problems and I think this a catch up --maybe this is now real time|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 2@C from North is cappelletti, one suited hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|roswolf: that was an interesting board|pg||
nt|andyv:  is E planning to invite with his hand?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: double coming|pg||
nt|athene: Cappelletti is very rare this side of the atlantic|pg||
nt|yo_yo: not rare in manchester|pg||
mb|p|pc|cA|pc|c2|nt|iain sime: 3C is obviously a 4 card raise.|pg||
nt|eamongall: but West is going to be disappointed to see @HAK not scoring even 1 trick |pg||
nt|eamongall: still enough for 1 off at least |pg||
nt|mdgraham: he won't worry - they'll be getting plenty more|pg||
nt|yo_yo: nor it seems in Belfast|pg||
pc|c3|nt|yo_yo: what else would Holland do?  Void in opps suit and partner showed good support|pg||
nt|eggy: Not that unhappy once he discovers that N only holds 5 spades i think|pg||
nt|eamongall: 2 off on that lead |pg||
nt|eamongall: thats without GIB button by the way|pg||
nt|eggy: well done Eamon |pg||
nt|mdgraham: this would be better if South had had four trumps|pg||
nt|eamongall: 4@Hs will be off a few on trump leads |pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|athene: well, one pair play it anyway :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: will Hastings be fooled?|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h5|pc|h8|pc|h4|pg||
nt|eamongall: but probably off 1 in reality as who leads trumps frm @HQTxx|pg||
nt|andyv:  modified capp (or hamilton, depending on which coast you are from in the states) has taken over |pg||
nt|athene: you can often deceive the defence by two cards where you couldn't by one|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c4|nt|eamongall: we won't see this board result until end of other room ..in 2 hours time |pg||
nt|athene: because of count signals just showing the parity|pg||
pc|s3|pc|c5|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, and E opened a bit light vulnerable -- that might have helped NS reach 4@S|pg||
pc|hK|pc|s8|pc|h3|pc|h9|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|nt|yo_yo: john Holland - shortest biography ever  and NO pic  on http://www.ebu.co.uk/general/biographies/players/JohnHolland.htm|pg||
