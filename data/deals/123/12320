nt|roswolf: hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: hi good morning everyone :)|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|athene: strong club; time for south to wade in with some cunning bid or other|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w are strong clubbers with lots of transfers + gadgets|pg||
mb|p|nt|chessmaste: A few weeks ago Crouch and Patterson were on opposite sides in the Gold Cup Final|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|athene: NS should get into 4@S very quickly and give opps a bit of a problem|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|nt|athene: they won't get into 4@S by passing!|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D!|nt|chessmaste: South's pass over 1@C is very old fashioned|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: n/s if they can bid might find a spade save|pg||
nt|chessmaste: I will send them a copy of Defences to a Strong Club|pg||
mb|4S|nt|chessmaste: E/W use a lot of transfers - here 2@D is likely to show good heart support|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed not playing weak 2 suited bids may harm them here - over a tartan 2@S e/w may have had a lot of trouble bidding the slam|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|mb|6H|nt|roswolf: well on the way now 4@S being the key bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: 4@s = RKC @H|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c8|pc|c3|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
pc|hA|nt|roswolf: ah just the blackwood cannon - not so impressed now!|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|athene: 1@H was just 4+ hearts forcing 1 round|pg||
pc|s3|nt|roswolf: but well done to power into the slam|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h3|pg||
pc|cK|nt|athene: when east hears of support he can blast keycard and conceal his side-suit, which makes it harder for the defence|pg||

mb|p|nt|garnetts: tough hand all round here par seems to be a save in 6@S |pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|snetram: agressive again|pg||
mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|hedyg: NS play very weak weak|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Kvangraven is known to bid every time he has 13 cards|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hamilton likes that response|pg||
mb|4N|nt|marlowepi: the hand is not really worth an overcall followed by a double. but i like immediate double even less.|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Hi Marshall|pg||
nt|garnetts: I would have bid on the South hand--especially since partner has passed|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but i assume you would overcall|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: 4@S is very pushy |pg||
nt|rodal f: 6-9 and 5@H+ I belive|pg||
mb|6H|nt|hedyg: best defense would be @C lead and 10@d by S|pg||
nt|snetram: i am not agree with 2@H opening. Bad bridge - A,K and weak suit ( 5332)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: some like a few point to overcall |pg||
mb|6S|nt|hedyg: but that is totally DD|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|nt|garnetts: well done all round |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Won't it just go 2 down with normal defence?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: silent opposition in the open room|pg||
pc|cA|nt|garnetts: A@D and and an underlead will get maximum|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c5|pc|c2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe not any more|pg||
nt|hedyg: not if gets to disc a @d on @H and ruff a @D|pg||
nt|athene: south didn't anticipate that declarer might have two heart tricks :) his partner has to have a pretty bad suit for that to happen :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: a bit risky|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h2|pc|h3|pg||
nt|snetram: Why E bid 4@S?|pg||
nt|hedyg: his turn to bid?|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not really |pg||
pc|h5|nt|garnetts: what else |pg||
pc|s3|nt|yo_yo: i tried it recently and declarer's singleton King made|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|garnetts: one off rather than two |pg||
nt|yo_yo: better one down than making :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: but is off for sure--more risky if it might give the contract|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i hate that look on partner's face when it makes|pg||
nt|marlowepi: is that worse than the look on teammates faces?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgj: N closed board to ask east about W's pass in bidding|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s6|nt|Walddk2: Soft defence, but down it goes|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i dont blame him|pg||
pc|sA|nt|hedyg: if you are going to play @d though i am sure 10@d is best|pg||

mc|9|nt|yo_yo: i bet EW dont have an agreement about pass|pg||
nt|garnetts: Seems typical of bridge today---make your guess and get on with it---why ask what pass means --you can bet it is encouraging a slam |pg||
nt|Vugraphzgj: W says it was showing 1 keycard, @HK|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: south shoulf intervene but may not have a convenient way into the auction|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|chessmaste: If NS had been up to 4@S by the time the bidding got back to East he might well have bid 4NT to show his two suiter and 6@H should still be reached|pg||
nt|athene: it's standard to lead high from QJ9xx - the nine maks the difference|pg||
nt|roswolf: east wont like playing this one|pg||
nt|athene: it's fairly easy for east to play - he just plugs away at spades and waits to see if the defence get everything right|pg||

pc|s8|pc|s6|pc|sJ|pc|s3|pg||

nt|roswolf: defence went badly astray here|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sT|pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|chessmaste: South return makes no sense - assuming North had shown the C!Q|pg||
nt|athene: they lead J from QJ at trick 1- but maybe south thought they reverted to standard subsequently|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d8|pc|c3|nt|athene: so the @CJ denied the @CQ for him|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|s9|pc|d6|pc|h9|pc|c9|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|pc|h3|nt|athene: or maybe south just was worried about setting up slow club tricks for declarer if north's clubs were slightly less solid|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c5|pc|c6|pc|cT|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|h8|nt|chessmaste: A bad misunderstanding for an International pair|pg||
mc|7|nt|roswolf: at this level a poor situation - even club players discuss these things|pg||
pg||
qx|c2|st||md|4SA64HQ75DQJ964CA5,SQJ7H932D872C7642,ST53HAJ4D53CQJT93,SK982HKT86DAKTCK8|sv|n|nt|Walddk2: This is a good result for Kvangraven|pg||
nt|Walddk2: First you have to bid 3NT, and then make it|pg||
nt|chick: but still a 2-point spread|pg||
nt|garnetts: so what--he wants to have his cake and eat it|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ah it was DOPI|pg||
nt|yo_yo: pass showing 1 key card|pg||
nt|marlowepi: seems odd that internationalists would not have an agreement about handling interference over 4N. is this a new partnership or something?|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|garnetts: Like much of what I see today--in my view if North wants an adjustment he should employ a chiropractor|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: i wouldnt have an agreement about the final pass  but yes over 4NT  |pg||
pc|d6|pc|d2|pc|d5|nt|garnetts: Good lead for declarer here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i doubt thatthe final pass was the issue|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|s2|nt|garnetts: close between small and the Q |pg||
pc|s4|nt|hedyg: 1NT is a constructive bid|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s5|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s3|nt|snetram: NS pay at least 500 in any contract|pg||
nt|athene: surprising to pass 2nt there with two aces and two potentially useful tens|pg||
pc|s9|nt|athene: after his 4@S last board|pg||
nt|hedyg: he already bid his hand when he bid 1NT|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|athene: north dodged a bullet, doubling rather than overcalling 1nt - that might have led to a lot of trouble for NS|pg||
pc|d7|nt|hedyg: 1NT should show 8-10|pg||
nt|chick: both tens are in suits that W doesn't have, so they may not be worth much|pg||
pc|d3|nt|chick: same with the length in @Ds|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hQ|nt|rodal f: Norwegian specs will tell me if I'm wrong. Belive it's still 6 cup rounds before the final are to be played. At 3rd round the best teams play there first cup match. |pg||
nt|athene: i would say both tens are working quite hard|pg||
nt|chick: he has almost nothing to help set up tricks in W's suits|pg||
nt|athene: give partner nothing in diamonds and just the jack in spades for instance|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|pg||
nt|athene: @S10 and @D10 both help to give you a double stopper|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d8|nt|snetram: typical auction - 1@S - X -pas - 2@D - X - pas...|pg||
nt|garnetts: odd play surely |pg||
pc|cQ|pc|dK|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|pc|s7|nt|chick: but do nothing to actually establish a source of tricks|pg||

pc|cJ|pc|cK|nt|chick: the @C9 was more valuable :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: best defense by N|pg||
nt|snetram: 1@S x 1NT like natural make non sens.|pg||

nt|athene: it's normal to drop a trick or two in defence to 1nt|pg||
nt|athene: dropping four is by no means a record|pg||
nt|roswolf: 6@C is the target here|pg||
nt|chessmaste: A chance for NS to redeem themselves|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|p|mb|1S!|mb|p|nt|roswolf: 1@S = control showing?|pg||
mb|1N!|mb|p|mb|2C!|mb|p|mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4C!|mb|p|mb|4H!|mb|p|nt|chessmaste: If 1@C was Blue 1@S would be 3 controls, but I have a feeling this is something else|pg||
nt|roswolf: england found the save in 6@S on bd 1 - a well deserved 11 imps|pg||
nt|athene: strong club; 1@S = 8+ hcp balanced|pg||
nt|athene: now 1nt and 2@D will be relays|pg||
nt|athene: probably asking about shape|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzgn: sorry , can't read writing from here|pg||
nt|roswolf: that auction fell badly short|pg||
nt|athene: 6@C really should be reached on these hands given a free run|pg||
nt|roswolf: agreed|pg||
nt|chessmaste: So say all of us|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|athene: uncontested strong club auctions are one area where you make your money; otherwise don't play strong club|pg||
nt|chessmaste: You have to understand the methods - its not clear that NS did on this deal|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|pc|c5|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h4|nt|athene: south just needs to discover that his partner has three clubs and the @DA|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|pc|h8|pc|hT|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h9|nt|roswolf: yes the accuracy of the strong club system in the slam zone is the virtue of the system|pg||
pc|d3|pc|sT|pg||
nt|athene: the @CJ makes 6@C a lot better but you bid it even without finding that|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|s4|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cK|nt|athene: because without it, the slam is about 50%, and he might have it|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c2|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|d5|pc|d2|pc|h5|pg||
mc|11|nt|athene: against a very aggressive pair, when they don't intervene over the strong club, the odds of 2-2 clubs goes up|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Yes, but as far as I can see South never  showed his shape, so unless he knew North's his whole plan was wrong |pg||
pg||
qx|c3|st||md|1SAHAKQ65D8CAT8643,SJ63HJ972DKJT4CK7,SKQ72H84DA953CJ95,ST9854HT3DQ762CQ2|sv|e|nt|marlowepi: more slams|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|nt|garnetts: 4@H in the OR --6@C is laydown --not sure if it is that good|pg||
nt|marlowepi: laydown??|pg||
mb|1H|nt|hedyg: can make it now|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: can't fail as the cards lie surely|pg||
nt|yo_yo: looks laydown to me|pg||
mb|1S!|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: cold as cards lie,yes|pg||
nt|marlowepi: laydown means you can lay your hand down|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|garnetts: Not sure how good it is as a %age|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ok laydown at trick 3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: depends on lead as to how good it is. diamond leads hurts the a priori %|pg||
nt|yo_yo: simpson is treading carefully here, no  jump to 2@H|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|athene: you put the jack in right away to find if the finesse is on|pg||
nt|garnetts: Yes no communivation for the double club finesse on nay lead is there?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: fast arrival  says no slam?|pg||
mb|5S|nt|yo_yo: 4@C would be stronger|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: the D lead matters to KQ7 onside|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rodal f: Can do by any lead I belive|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: with hearts breaking badly|pg||
nt|marlowepi: wd in auction|pg||
pc|s3|nt|garnetts: I prefer 5@C as a picture raise  first round @D control and reasonable clubs |pg||
nt|yo_yo: that sounds great (if it means that )|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: you don't want to run it round to the ace and then finesse because if it lost opps could cash and you would be worse off|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sA|pg||
nt|yo_yo: I wouldnt be confident with my partners|pg||
nt|garnetts: Now what is the best way to play clubs?   Take a finesse and play for the drop or cash the ace first?|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|pc|c5|pc|c2|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cK|pc|c9|pc|cQ|pg||

nt|athene: but at these colours that's less of an indication admittedly|pg||
nt|chessmaste: EW were vulnerable - they are less likley to come in in any event|pg||
nt|athene: it was strange that NS, a strong club pair themselves, were so passive on the first board|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|chessmaste: Another slam - three in four boards|pg||
nt|athene: they should know the value of intervention simply by virtue of finding it annoying themselves|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S!|an|8+, less than 4!s|nt|roswolf: i would expect e/w to bid this |pg||
nt|athene: well EW have a solid 6-5 spade fit this time|pg||
nt|athene: NS sorry|pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: maybe they can make their presence felt :)|pg||
mb|2C|nt|roswolf: well now how high will north go|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Inexperienced players tend to think - they have a strong hand, better pass - while those who know better think - they have a strong hand, better bid|pg||
nt|chessmaste: 4@S looks right|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: i would bid 4@S but then i can see the cards!|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|chessmaste: Well, you do have six card support!|pg||
nt|athene: 1@S was 4+@H GF|pg||
nt|roswolf: true normally enough|pg||
nt|athene: once you have locked into a game-forcing auction, you have many more options after intervention, primarily because pass becomes forcing|pg||
nt|athene: but to make use of all this you need lots of agreements|pg||
nt|chessmaste: A less demure commentator might describe North's bid in somewhat uncomplimentary terms|pg||
mb|4S|nt|roswolf: might still not get to the grand|pg||
mb|d|mb|r|nt|athene: you basically need to be able to penalize them if they step way out of line|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: and also show a variety of hands|pg||
nt|chessmaste: A daft double by South, allowing West to show first round spade control|pg||
nt|roswolf: mark - demure is one word i wouldnt expect from you:)|pg||
nt|athene: 4@H as a cue for clubs would be nice but i guess it would have been natural for east|pg||
mb|4N|nt|roswolf: true mark may let e/w into evaluating their hands to the grand|pg||
nt|athene: 4@H directly over 3@S would presumably have been showing a much better suit, so pass - then - 4@H would be more scrambling|pg||
nt|chessmaste: I can see why West rebid his clubs, but I would have considered 4@D|pg||
nt|athene: so 4@S was a good bit of improvisation|pg||
nt|roswolf: north is now regreting not bidding 4@S|pg||
nt|athene: but it's going to be very hard for east to bid a grand slam|pg||
nt|athene: because he doesn't know his partner's shape|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: if west is confident of the @CK in pards hand he will be close to bidding it|pg||
nt|roswolf: ouch!|pg||
nt|roswolf: the brakes came on suddenly|pg||
nt|athene: i'm sure EW would have bid at least six if given a free run - they should still have done but it's always harder with less space|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: long explanations being written|pg||
nt|athene: even this relatively wet NS bidding worked out well|pg||

nt|yo_yo: here's  another slam!|pg||
nt|garnetts: Yes Kath but what does 5@C mean then?  3@S was available as a grope|pg||
mb|1C|nt|athene: if this gets into a battle of reds vs blacks it might easily end up in 4@S, not 3|pg||

nt|garnetts: 3@D is forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: i dont think S will fight hard|pg||
nt|athene: e.g. 3@D fit -showing from west, and then north decides it might be a double-fit and just bids 4@S|pg||

nt|athene: they doubled 2@S and got it -3 despite leading into the @DAQ at trick 1|pg||
nt|roswolf: now what is that?|pg||
nt|athene: 2@C might be weak with 4+clubs 4+major (as here)|pg||
nt|athene: or it might be a "normal" strong club-style 2@C bid (10-15, 6+ clubs)|pg||
nt|athene: seems strange to mix those two|pg||

mb|2S!|nt|athene: hard for north to go to 5@S over 5@D|pg||
mb|d|nt|roswolf: this looks a bit difficult to bid|pg||
nt|athene: 5@D might even be down - partner might do something nice occasionally like lead a singleton club|pg||
mb|4S|nt|roswolf: the spotlight is on east|pg||
nt|athene: east might bid 6@D here|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|athene: it would be a bit pushy i think|pg||
mb|4N!|nt|chessmaste: What? Why would he do that?|pg||
nt|athene: 4nt interesting - he's treating the hand as a 2-suiter|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: either 2 places to play or slam try@h?|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|nt|athene: right|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: so the idea is, if you bid 4nt (ostensibly scrambling) and then pull 5@C, not to 5@D, but to 5@H, that has to be a slam try, because it can't be a red 2-suiter|pg||
mb|p|pc|cK|nt|athene: i remember some debate over whether it was better to play that as 1-suited hearts and the direct 5@H as the slam try|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c5|pc|c4|pg||
nt|athene: because if partner bids 5@D over 4nt, and you bid 5@H, now partner doesn't know if you have @H+@C or the slam try|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cQ|pc|c7|pc|cJ|pg||
