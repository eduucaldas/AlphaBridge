nt|brolucius: Hi to the kibitzers!|pg||
mb|p|nt|barnets: I looked thru the hands a very lucky slam swing was 2 imps|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|barnets: 26 imps|pg||
nt|dagold: right|pg||
nt|brolucius: A handsome lead to England, I am pleased to see. Although of course all commentators are truly impartial on BBO.|pg||
mb|1D|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Not only that, Barnet. Also the 5@S|pg||
nt|dagold: 2@c showing hearts I guess|pg||
nt|brolucius: I saw Crouch and Patterson play well yesterday in a big win. Very reliable they were in the bidding. I hope this will not prove to be a further example of Commentators' Curse.|pg||
mb|2S|nt|copeyj: gm all|pg||
mb|p|nt|dagold: GA Simon|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Both pairs play Strong Club|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hello Simon|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dQ|nt|Walddk2: This is an awkward contract|pg||
nt|copeyj: yes|pg||
nt|dagold: but 3nt not good at all on paper|pg||
nt|barnets: but with QXX hearts in the slot|pg||
nt|dagold: good here of course|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But makeable via the heart finesse|pg||
nt|copeyj: wonder if Patterson showed 5@S |pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4 spades, 5 hearts, 1 diamond|pg||
nt|dagold: i suspect so|pg||
nt|dagold: but AKQx is like 5|pg||
nt|copeyj: indeed|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: big think from declarer|pg||
nt|copeyj: i dont think we've seen half of the big think yet|pg||
nt|brolucius: If N/S are playing 'ace for attitude, king for count', they may lead the queen for an attitude signal.|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|pc|dA|pg||
nt|copeyj: im sure thats the case|pg||
nt|dagold: rev attitude it looks like|pg||
nt|brolucius: Leading the king and hearing of an odd number of cards opposite would not be very helpful to declarer.|pg||
nt|brolucius: To the defender, I mean.|pg||
nt|dagold: very tricky now|pg||
nt|copeyj: Wilkinson is Alex Wilkinson, a longstanding Scottish Jnr International who has represented them at open level a few times|pg||
nt|dagold: must play a heart I think|pg||
nt|dagold: but does he risk the finness?|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h6|pc|hJ|pc|h8|pg||
nt|brolucius: He got that one right!|pg||
nt|dagold: good play, realised it was his best chance|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|d6|pc|h4|pg||
nt|copeyj: wonder what count N/S play - not sure this is a situation in which north shld give true count |pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|pc|d9|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Again a lucky escape for England. I can understand if the Scottish supporters are fed up by now|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: i think N played diff cards (sorry)|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3NT was not that much better, if at all.|pg||
nt|copeyj: Well 3N was hardly a bed of roses Roland|pg||
nt|dagold: 3nt very poor|pg||
nt|Walddk2: How good do you think 4@S is?|pg||
nt|barnets: better though|pg||
nt|brolucius: About the same.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No way|pg||
nt|copeyj: a bit worse than 3N|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3NT is clearly better|pg||
nt|dagold: 3nt may fail with the heart right|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|pc|dJ|pc|s2|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c8|pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|dagold: 3nt is better since if the heart loses you can hope the club king is right I suppose but not so much in it|pg||
nt|barnets: so dec can score 2 ruffs in dummy|pg||
pc|h9|pc|sQ|nt|barnets: or 1 ruff|pg||
pc|dT|pc|h3|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cT|pc|s7|pc|c9|pg||
nt|barnets: if south pitches a club|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d8|pc|sK|pc|dK|pg||
pc|c6|nt|barnets: and ruffs with the S9|pg||
mc|10|nt|barnets: so the def lost a trick|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|nt|roswolf: the english played in a moysian fit|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|ady: likely to be a similar result to OR|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: certainly played in many major international events and rcently as i said brought back a gold medal from Brazil no mean achievement|pg||
nt|ady: reached 4@S   on 4-3 fit in OR      3NT  with the 5 heart tricks available will make|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|mayors: XX = 1@h response, 1@h probably 3 cards|pg||
mb|2D|nt|Walddk4: Good afternoon to Heather Dhondy|pg||
mb|d|nt|rodal f: Are EW hooked of now? Y|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  man's decision from S - let's see how would be the play|pg||
nt|ppiglett: What was Rdble - T/f?|pg||
nt|mayors: yes xfer|pg||
nt|heatherd: Hi All|pg||
nt|ady: hi|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi:)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|jackthelad: nice lie of the cards for N/S|pg||
nt|ady: redouble show hearts?|pg||
nt|lestergold: E/W can make 3N or 4S 3n seems a more normal spot|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: e/w   may stop short of game     not that unreaasonable|pg||
nt|roswolf: enjoying being npc heather?|pg||
mb|3C|nt|mayors: Yes 4+ @hs|pg||
nt|ady: thx|pg||
mb|p|nt|heatherd: I'm not doing it until the 2nd weekend. Hopefully I'll be taking over with the team in a good position!|pg||
nt|roswolf: this auction is meandering somewhat|pg||
nt|lestergold: well David its a combined 26 count and thats dabgerous not to play gam,e at teams|pg||
nt|lestergold: and unusual|pg||
mb|p|nt|heatherd: I'm sure EW will wind up in 3NT somehow|pg||
nt|ady: there is 26 hcp   between them   but it appears they are not definately aware   and the hands dont fit well|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: well he has passed|pg||
nt|heatherd: OK, wrong again!|pg||
pc|dK|nt|marlowepi: especially with E playing heart 8|pg||
nt|mayors: The red honours lay very well for NS|pg||
nt|ady: club lead makes life difficult|pg||
nt|mayors: Yes 2@h more awkward than 2@d, a bit surpised crouch preferred @hs|pg||
nt|ppiglett: The hand lies will for 2H, on the nose for 110 and a flat board my prediction. Any wagers?|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Hugh must go looking for a diamond ruff holding trump control|pg||
nt|mayors: I expect 8 tricks I think|pg||
nt|ppiglett: might sorry!|pg||
nt|ady: might go wrong on a club lead  and further club s from defence|pg||
nt|mayors: On club lead may play to ruff three clubs in dummy|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Wont get the ruff, I agree club will put S under pressure|pg||
pc|d3|nt|lestergold: well they are not going to recove their deficit playing games in part sxcores even if the games dont come with a bank of scotland guarantee|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dA|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h4|pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h2|pc|d6|nt|marlowepi: always going to make with spade ten doubleton|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h8|pc|d9|pc|hQ|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|marlowepi: even on club lead|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d4|pc|c2|pg||
nt|roswolf: the scottish e/w have been somewhat subdued in this match so far|pg||
nt|heatherd: It seems to me that West should be driving game after partner's 2@d bid - clearly showing extras|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c8|pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|lestergold: I agree Heather|pg||
nt|roswolf: agreed|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|c6|pc|d2|pc|d7|pg||
nt|lestergold: west should have bid 3S which gives east a choice opf games|pg||
nt|garnetts: 3NT was as good as this |pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|sJ|pc|s5|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
pc|cT|pc|s4|pc|c9|pc|c7|pg||
pc|dT|nt|lestergold: couldnt bid 3N himself as the fourth suit diamond bid did not gurantee a diamond stop|pg||
mc|8|nt|heatherd: 1st blood to the English in this segment then|pg||
nt|roswolf: going off is adding insult to injury|pg||
pg||
qx|o18|st||md|4S764HA854D72C7532,SJH9DKJ865CAKQJ94,SAQ983HKJ6DQT9CT8,SKT52HQT732DA43C6|sv|n|nt|brolucius: 3NT was less attractive after the diamond overcall, althought slightly better than 4@S even so. Anyway, they have landed a big plus-score so I am happy with that.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 9 counts are frequently opened in the E-W methods but apparently not this one|pg||
nt|barnets: 3N top spot|pg||
nt|dagold: if Crouch opens 1 strong @c they may reach it|pg||
mb|5C|nt|dagold: not so easy if he opens 2@c but it may happen|pg||
nt|Walddk2: lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzgp: wrong number of @c!|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: ahem|pg||
mb|p|nt|dagold: I didn't predicty that!|pg||
mb|p|pc|dT|nt|Walddk2: Oh dear|pg||
nt|copeyj: oh my|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, I thought me might lead a diamond.|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d7|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Walddk2: The only lead to let it through. Unlucky for the Scots again|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c6|pc|c2|pg||
nt|brolucius: The luck is running England's way.|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cT|pc|h2|pc|c3|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|dagold: Difficult lead for Wilkinson. A trump is possible|pg||
pc|s3|pc|h3|pc|c5|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|s8|pc|s2|pc|c7|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d9|pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
pc|d4|nt|barnets: @SA I would lead|pg||
mc|11|pg||
qx|c18|st||md|4S764HA854D72C7532,SJH9DKJ865CAKQJ94,SAQ983HKJ6DQT9CT8,SKT52HQT732DA43C6|sv|n|nt|april7: very light openings nowadays, but might come out alright, one present was already given, so with 10 of @S favourable the contract is made|pg||
nt|marlowepi: would be made without the present|pg||
nt|mayors: No I don't think so|pg||
nt|mayors: South always was going to score a second @s trick|pg||
nt|lestergold: and the extra whammy of playingt in a nisht machen part score|pg||
nt|heatherd: He could have bid 3@d though|pg||
nt|lestergold: he had plenty of bids better than pass|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C|nt|heatherd: Another promising result for Englad here.|pg||
nt|lestergold: i like 3s because it cant be nmisunderstood |pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
mb|1S|mb|1N|nt|ady: one of the defenders needed a 14th club|pg||
mb|p|nt|mayors: 2@c another xfer|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Take second spade, play the king and a heart to the ten and cash the DQ - one down no?|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3N will be fine|pg||
nt|heatherd: 10@d lead in the other room, thank you very much!|pg||
mb|2D|nt|lestergold: 3N a better contract than 5C|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes lucky for the english|pg||
nt|ady: 5C got through in OR     north lead a diamond|pg||
nt|heatherd: Much better.|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes 3nt is where you would choose to play i think|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: i could get to like this |pg||
nt|jackthelad: interesting decison to open 1|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and without the opening bid, game could easily be missed|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  in 3rd seat - looks well |pg||
nt|april7: thats right|pg||
nt|marlowepi: seems normal to open 1|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it is not good strategy to advertise weakness in 3rd seat facing a passed hand, esp at these colours|pg||
nt|lestergold: cant blame the 5C bid with a top heavy hand fearful of letting opps in with the majors|pg||
mb|p|nt|jackthelad: wouldn't occur to me....rubber or imps....bash|pg||
nt|mayors: No, west had 4 spades and can only get rid of one of the @d Q|pg||
mb|p|pc|s4|nt|ady: on some lays 3NT would go down with 5 of a minor making|pg||
nt|roswolf: but not today|pg||
nt|lestergold: Many would take same action as Crouch did|pg||
nt|garnetts: 3NT bid makes it clear --maybe 3@D after 1NT would show 6-5|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ppiglett: You're right sorry|pg||
nt|ady: some imps for england here    irosh down in both rooms|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|lestergold: good try by Price|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pc|h9|pg||
nt|yo_yo: it's like a speedball|pg||
nt|lestergold: but pards hearts not god enough|pg||
pc|h4|nt|vugraphzgk: you missed a lot at the start|pg||
pc|d5|nt|marlowepi: of all weak 2 bids, 2H is the least effective. less preemptive than 2S, and unlike 2D it helps the opps by reducing their principal targets to just ONE major and NT|pg||
pc|hK|nt|heatherd: Yes. If East hadn't had the 10@h this was needed.|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|mayors: 3@h showed a mixed raise about 6-8 with 4 trumps|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hT|pc|h5|pc|d6|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c5|pc|cA|pc|c8|pg||
nt|heatherd: Over trick now, and 1 back to Scotland|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cT|pc|s5|nt|jackthelad: was an auto 3 to me|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||

nt|brolucius: I would lead a heart. I like leading from K-J combinations.|pg||
nt|copeyj: Seriously, David?|pg||
nt|dagold: I don't like the heart lead at all|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|barnets: nor me|pg||
nt|copeyj: That would be my 4th choice|pg||
mb|3N|nt|brolucius: Seriously, yes. I rarely look elsewhere if I have such a combination available.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|copeyj: no make it my 5th choice - id rather abstain|pg||
mb|p|pc|c4|nt|dagold: not sure if you are joking or not David|pg||
nt|copeyj: me neither lol|pg||
nt|brolucius: West pre-empts and you don't think there is a good chance of partner holding the ace or queen of hearts?|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cT|pc|cA|pg||
pc|h7|nt|brolucius: I nearly didn't mention it, I thought a heart lead was so obvious.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|copeyj: rofl|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|dagold: the Ace probably won't matter since you can cash it later|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|dagold: so only playing for the queen|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h3|pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
pc|s9|nt|dagold: and it could be a disaster|pg||
pc|s4|nt|reisig: Hope David isn't armed :)|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s7|pg||
pc|d2|nt|dagold: I think leading a heart is 4th choice, but still not sure if you are joking|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dJ|nt|barnets: leading the A gives you the chance to switch horses|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
pc|h8|nt|Walddk2: I think he is dead serious|pg||
nt|copeyj: www.camrosebridge.com for a link to the website with all the info including running scores|pg||
nt|brolucius: You must agree with Fritzi Gordon, who advised Sandra Landy 'Never lead from a king'. Not my idea of good advice.|pg||
mc|10|nt|barnets: and seldom loses atrick when dec has shortness|pg||
pg||

nt|lestergold: Price is correct to try and beat contract if its possible he will usually find the right card|pg||
mb|1H|nt|mayors: Catchall @d from south|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: I see Price Simpson play a fairly natural system with 4 card majors|pg||
mb|2C|nt|lestergold: of course they are both outstanding money players|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|Walddk4: http://www.camrosebridge.com/  for a website with lots of useful information|pg||
nt|marlowepi: offense-defense ratio is not skewed toward former, may turn plus into minus (maybe a big one), may push opps to a game they wont bid if i open ne|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: if Simpson plays 3NT    defence might win leading a spade    |pg||
mb|3N|nt|garnetts: 3NT might well show this  with three card support in the old days --suspect it means somehting else now|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mayors: 2@d shows @hs, Crouch/Patterson play transfers in just about every conceivable situation|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: will need to play K@H to make 3NT   |pg||
nt|garnetts: also like the OR it is wrong sided |pg||
pc|s6|nt|heatherd: Spade lead will give problems.|pg||
nt|ady: spade lead    and heart back   and 2nd spade|pg||
nt|lestergold: spade lead as expected on the auction|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sQ|pc|s7|pg||
nt|ady: spades 5-3   would have made life more difficult|pg||
nt|ady: wonder if East will lead Q@D|pg||
nt|mayors: Might do, must be thinking about it|pg||
nt|heatherd: Weak NT auction in the other room gave no info for the lead.|pg||
nt|garnetts: The down side of playing a 3NT gadget then |pg||
nt|lestergold: west must win first heart|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ppiglett: definitely thinking about it - yes|pg||
nt|mayors: J from QJ|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d5|pc|dT|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h4|pc|h7|nt|jackthelad: ultra conservatve wins out here|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|ady: was going to make anyway   but if head done that without Q! and west had Q! then that would have let game through|pg||
nt|ady: Q@H|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Who was Rusinov?|pg||
nt|ppiglett: true and south was certain to hold 3/4 diamonds from the bidding, more likely to be 4.|pg||
nt|lestergold: its off|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s8|pg||

nt|copeyj: KJ combos my last preference for leads yet it is at the top of your list :)|pg||
mb|1H|nt|brolucius: Not quite top.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|barnets: we wont be buying davids lead book|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: I have never written one. (Yet)|pg||
mb|2D!|mb|p|nt|vugraphzgp: 10-13 i think for 2@d? |pg||
nt|dagold: no game making here|pg||
nt|copeyj: 25 high but no good game - and in fact no making game that i can see|pg||
nt|dagold: can they produce another one of their great stops?|pg||
mb|3C|an|a|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|dagold: Looks like they will overeach which is fairly normal|pg||
nt|copeyj: to be fair Patterson doesnt like his QX@C now as partner is almost certainly the shape he is, but still too much of a view to stop short|pg||
mb|4H|nt|dagold: I guess they are commited by now|pg||
mb|p|nt|dagold: at least this has play, although not alot|pg||
nt|dagold: and not today assuming a club lead|pg||
nt|brolucius: North has a tricky lead (with no K-J combination available).|pg||
nt|barnets: hard to see why outh did not x 3@c|pg||
nt|dagold: yes he might have to lead his JT8x in the unbid suit|pg||
nt|barnets: always best to help your partner find the lead|pg||
nt|barnets: in my experience|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|reisig: and ..you need all the help you can get!|pg||

nt|brolucius: Indeed. Very good yesterday.|pg||
nt|dagold: Scotland missed game altogether on 17|pg||

nt|lestergold: trappy hand for E/W the duplication in cluibs meaning their points arent pulling their full weight|pg||
nt|heatherd: Tricky hand this. Values for game, but nothing obvious on.|pg||
nt|ady: England tried the only game with a chance in OR  |pg||

nt|ady: 9@C|pg||
nt|Walddk8: We think 6@D can make double dummy on any lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: standard technique is not to risk giving anything away against 6N|pg||
mb|4D|nt|jackthelad: W cant believe his luck...but E will exit to @h, and that is that|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  does 3NT mean something special like "good @h fit" or is W just counting till 9 (tricks)? |pg||
nt|vugraphzgk: 3NT explained to South as "not in system"|pg||
nt|lestergold: they desrev to make it if they bid well enought to reach it|pg||
nt|lestergold: and its looking likely|pg||
nt|heatherd: Deosn't 6NT require South to put up the K@s on the first round? Not easy if played early.|pg||
nt|heatherd: To defeat it|pg||
nt|lestergold: there is an end play indeed Heathe rif not|pg||
nt|ady: obviously you can finesse 9@D early   then ruff a heart  and make 12 tricks   but who is going to play that way|pg||
nt|lestergold: but its all a bit double dummyiash|pg||
nt|heatherd: Looks like they're heading for 6@d. That'll be interesting|pg||
nt|lestergold: whatever the result 6D will be well bid and very unlucky when it probably goes off|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: but if E bids 4@H then W might try for more|pg||

nt|lestergold: nor he either|pg||
nt|roswolf: 6nt is a practical shot it seems to me - south will do really well to find the defence as heather says|pg||
nt|heatherd: Now 3@d was lowest 4-card suit, and 4@d agreed @d|pg||
nt|Walddk8: Yes Heather, or to unblock the king if the ace is cashed|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|nt|Walddk8: Anyway, they won't be playing 6NT|pg||

nt|heatherd: There's still the endplay though|pg||
nt|Walddk8: But against a North who would NEVER play the jack from J10x, immediate finesse is actually the percentage play, says Michael Rosenberg|pg||
nt|lestergold: now must try the spade and hope to catch simpson|pg||
nt|heatherd: Same as in 6NT, South must unblock the K@s|pg||

pc|d4|pc|d7|pc|d9|nt|lestergold: and genuinely sorry for them if they dont make this even tho im biased being english|pg||

mb|p|mb|1H|nt|ady: England stopped safely in 2@S OR|pg||
nt|mayors: 1@d usually 0-7|pg||
nt|ady: just wonder if they might push too high?|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Pass 1N pass t.f to spades|pg||
nt|Walddk8: This has been an eventful set with lots of opportunities and a few missed chances. Great for watching|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
mb|2C|nt|lestergold: should make 4S played sensibly|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mayors: now 1NT 17-19 by McGann|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2s and a heart  to los|pg||
nt|Walddk8: Please explain 2@C someone|pg||
nt|heatherd: Yes, and they have done reasonably well to bid it.|pg||
nt|lestergold: all declarer needs to do is lose a ound of spades cash ace and  then play on minors eventually ruffing the third club in dummy|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|Walddk8: Well, it must have shown spades somehow|pg||
mb|3S|nt|Walddk8: I haven't seen this before|pg||
mb|p|nt|heatherd: I imagine that 2@c must show the other 2 suits. How this is different from double in their system, I don't know. I guess this must show 5@s judging by Price's response|pg||
mb|4S|nt|april7: did E promise 4 @S?|pg||

mb|p|nt|ppiglett: Hugh has options over the t/f to show max etc|pg||

nt|lestergold: void|pg||
nt|Walddk8: Maybe I am naive but a 1@S overcall is normal for most people. If it goes all pass after that, which game do you think you have missed?|pg||
nt|ady: as kibs have pointed out   also make if the diamonds are 4-2 but the 4 diamonds are with the 3 spades|pg||

nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|lestergold: a lot of debate aboutt hyen bidding from specs|pg||
nt|ady: west unsure about the club position|pg||
nt|lestergold: Price/simpson are natural and imaginative bidders|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C|mb|p|nt|ady: e/w  should be able to make 4@H   |pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|ady: fortunate heart position allows 10 tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: fairly routine 4H to bid and make I would have thought|pg||
mb|3C|nt|lestergold: 4H maes on any line|pg||
mb|p|nt|ppiglett: 4S actually a lucky make e-w but unbiddable|pg||
mb|3H|nt|roswolf: indeed |pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: if East is declarer  a diamond lead would be best   but still should make|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|jackthelad: good pass...very tempting to bid 2@h|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: but with west as declarer there is no defence |pg||
pc|s7|nt|ady: even better with west declarer|pg||
nt|lestergold: had east been declarer and received a diamond l;ead east would not to esclude south from getting in again|pg||
nt|lestergold: and would have to play the hearts accordingly which would have been successful here|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sT|pc|s8|pg||
nt|marlowepi: after the pass over 1S, game is remote, so not that hard to resist any temptation S may have felt to bid 2H|pg||
pc|c7|nt|jackthelad: easy from up here....but much harder at the table :)|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
nt|lestergold: Im told that David Walker has played in 28 out of last 20 camroses and is a three time gold cup winner|pg||
nt|lestergold: thx to spec for that info|pg||
nt|lestergold: 28 0ut of last 29 sorry|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|pc|d3|nt|ady: with west so short of entries will be forced to the winning line  playing hearts from the top|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|ady: now easier|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d7|pc|dJ|pc|dK|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|nt|ady: Price had to attack diamonds  to have any hope|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i wouldnt be too eager to trade a playable diamond fit for a possible 6 card heart fit|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|jackthelad: also, this is a very new partnership, so they are doing well so far|pg||
pc|s2|pc|h3|nt|lestergold: indeed|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
mc|10|nt|roswolf: next|pg||
