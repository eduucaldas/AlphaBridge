nt|chick: Hello Everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: welcome everyone :)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: rehi all! easy 6 @H to start with|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: Eliasson will get a nice surprise as his partner opens the bidding with 1@H :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: hmm 7 maybe?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: Good Morning everyone and welcome back to Linköping and the final rounds of the swedish premier league. We will follow the outcome of the match between BK Lyx and Örebridgen, both ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: fighting to stay in the top division|pg||
nt|varange: hello again|pg||
nt|col3435: hello Hugh, hi everyone|pg||
nt|varange: hi David|pg||
nt|col3435: hello again everyone|pg||

nt|chick: Hello Everyone :)|pg||
nt|kaapo: Or strong club?|pg||
mb|1D|nt|kaapo: Nope|pg||
mb|2D|nt|col3435: looks like a normal 3NT here then|pg||
nt|joemanjo: Hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: rehi Staffan|pg||
nt|mmmakela: sry meant 7|pg||

nt|vugraphzbf: ale ju¿ ustalili jak graj¹ :)|pg||
nt|chick: should easily find 3N here|pg||
nt|kaapo: Swedes love strong or 2-way club|pg||
nt|col3435: some well-fitting cards here|pg||
mb|d|an| |nt|mmmakela: bridge is one of the few sports where playing home is not that great an advantage|pg||
nt|suketbombi: HI all|pg||
nt|suketbombi: n-s play Demicoma a strong club 16+ convention and 12-15 NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: Hi again, Staffan :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Commentators Cornelia Yoder and Bob McPhee|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and Kari Patana|pg||
nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|joemanjo: We are off finally, only a small delay  :)|pg||
mb|3H|nt|kaapo: Hejssan :)|pg||
nt|joemanjo: Hi Vladimir|pg||
mb|p|nt|suketbombi: while e-w play a std convention|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: N has a rotten rdbl hand|pg||
nt|kaapo: Hejssan alla|pg||
nt|joemanjo: This looks like a West Bengal vs Delhi match. NS and EW respectively.|pg||
mb|p|nt|varange: welcome to the Swedish Premier League.|pg||
nt|joemanjo: Hi all|pg||
pc|d7|nt|kaapo: 1NT is about 17-19 here I suppose|pg||
nt|col3435: at least declarer has something to think about on this lead|pg||
nt|varange: NS played pretty slowly during the previous session|pg||
nt|othered1: Looks like they're headed for an easy 4@S|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|nt|kaapo: Straightforward bidding|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  Hello, Markku. Good evening to all|pg||
nt|kaapo: Did 3NT show clubs or @S shortness or something else?|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|varange: which meant that the OR caught up|pg||
nt|kaapo: 1NT = clubs or GF relay?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|sfoxa:  Hello, Kari.|pg||
pc|d9|nt|mmmakela: 3433 and 9 with no intermeds|pg||
nt|mcphee: 3nt a nice spot|pg||
nt|xenya: good stop but still an awkward contract|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes shd be a flat bd which is a good news for Khandelwals|pg||
nt|othered1: Possible without @C system for north to be declarer, but on this hand it doesn't matter|pg||
pc|d2|nt|kaapo: Hi Cornelia, Markku and Staffan|pg||
nt|chick: hard to pass with 2 aces though|pg||
nt|chick: and a lively first round of bidding dies quite suddenly|pg||
nt|rnc: For Running Scores, time schedule etc during the tournament: http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_plugins/content/content.php?content.877|pg||
nt|kaapo: Hi|pg||
nt|mmmakela: only guess who might have all 3 trumps|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: short @S and not min|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|chick: now that E sees that he set up the spades, he has to start grabbing tricks before losers can be pitched|pg||
nt|kaapo: Clubs will easily bring enough tricks for EW and luckily South hasn't got too high a heart in order to get a chance to play twice through West|pg||
nt|chick: with no entries, N must try to get to partner's hand again for another @H through|pg||
nt|col3435: if East is showing his shape this could turn out well|pg||
nt|kaapo: Ten tricks on top and 2 diamond ruffs bring it to twelve. 4-0 clubs shouldn't do much harm|pg||
pc|h8|nt|joemanjo: Both sides play Standard with variations|pg||
pc|h3|nt|burypies: tajemnicza 8@d|pg||
nt|kaapo: Hopefully 4@H was alerted too :)|pg||
pc|h7|nt|kaapo: Or are they playing with screens?|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|mmmakela: needs C A right here for starters,now might even make this akward contract|pg||
pc|c6|nt|kaapo: North might have some slam ambitions, if there are no wasted @S values|pg||
nt|rnc: For Running Scores, time schedule etc during the tournament: http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_plugins/content/content.php?content.877|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: north has shown 1-4 in majors with 5+@D here|pg||
nt|kaapo: Tack, Staffan|pg||
nt|vugraphzck: missed play...c\will claim at the end|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|mcphee: all over now|pg||
nt|varange: Ralf Willquist will be able to fill us in on most of the play as he knows the players|pg||
nt|varange: and our operator at the venue, Steffan, will keep us updated|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a big mistake to reach 6@s here. -2 if they can find the @c ruff on NS|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|burypies: Weijknis wiedzia³ ze 2! to dwukolorówka?|pg||
nt|burypies: 2@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzbf: tak wyjanione przed wistem|pg||
nt|burypies: je¿eli tak powinien zagraæ D@d|pg||
nt|burypies: wiedzia³ ¿e  rozgrywaj¹cy ma singla @d|pg||
nt|kaapo: I believe NS play 2-way club. North would open 1@C with 11-13 balanced, so he has kind of maximum|pg||
nt|mmmakela: I surely would because now 1 @S was forcing in my book and he passed!|pg||
nt|kaapo: I tried commentating in Swedish too, but my typing was a bit too slow in that language. I might do better now that PO is playing, though ;)|pg||
nt|varange: should be bid - ask Roland :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: I doubt even Roland would approve of this one :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: no screens, no alert since swedish rules say no alerting above 3nt|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|kaapo: Ok, then no alerts beyond 3NT|pg||
nt|col3435: opps had probably got the idea by that point anyway :)|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|kaapo: A kib suggests that 4@H was RKC in clubs|pg||
nt|suketbombi: will end up making 5@S|pg||
pc|d4|nt|varange: what systems do they play Ralf?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree Staffan!|pg||
nt|joemanjo: North may be AshiM Mukherjee - if so he is a player in the Indian Railways B team.|pg||
pc|s5|pc|hT|pg||
nt|col3435: mm. So presumably 3@h showed 4414 exactly|pg||
pc|h5|pc|dT|nt|xenya: should make with a careful play though, and he is on the right track|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|col3435: easy with spades breaking - but how would you play if South had five?|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c7|nt|ralfwil: strong @c from both pairs  - Staffan?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ralfwil: EW does and I thing NS too|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: yes, strong club, 17+, from both as far as i can see|pg||
nt|kaapo: The web site for the tournament is here http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_plugins/content/content.php?content.877|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|kaapo: You'll find running scores there too|pg||
nt|xenya: now another trump and @C hook |pg||
nt|xenya: but this line fails -- |pg||
nt|xenya: not clear why he decided to shorten himself in trumps, losing control|pg||
pc|d8|nt|rnc: For Running Scores, time schedule etc during the tournament: http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_plugins/content/content.php?content.877|pg||
pc|h9|pc|s2|nt|varange: NT is 14-16?|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|kaapo: It's very normal in Sweden to play 3rd and 5th leads, even against notrumps. Nyström - Wrang seem not to do it, though|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: I would say most swedes play 3rd-5th vs suit and 4th vs NT|pg||
pc|hA|nt|kaapo: And you can see that it's quite close in the top|pg||
pc|h2|pc|s7|nt|mdgraham: Good afternoon all|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|mmmakela: u right Kari 1c includes 10-12 nt so I take back my words|pg||
pc|c8|pc|h4|pc|cK|pc|c4|pg||
nt|kaapo: Yes, that's a sensible agreement|pg||
pc|sT|nt|mdgraham: This match seems a lot closer |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|chick: S cannot afford to try for an overtrick and lose a bunch of spades|pg||

nt|vugraphzpx: i would say they are pretty good, noone knows how good he is in a speedy :) I can ask him though... :)|pg||
nt|chick: Hello Everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: if south has 5 spades, the best way must be to play the 8 of clubs and let it go round to north|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: or even a small one|pg||
nt|col3435: yes that's nice|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes and the favoriates are trailing makes it more interesting|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: nice 4@H contract here|pg||
nt|kaapo: Rehi Cornelia|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  hello, Cornelia|pg||
nt|kaapo: 1NT looks interesting|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 1 nt seems needing swings|pg||
nt|kaapo: What does that show, then? :)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  if E decided to open 1nt, good ending could be 3nt |pg||
nt|kaapo: 10-13, might be off-shap?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  guess @d right - "only"|pg||
nt|joemanjo: What wd u open as North?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|othered1: yes, 26 imps can be found in 14 boards without doing much more than playing good bridge and getting a little lucky to have active hands.|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: Well, no need to interfere with his play :)|pg||
nt|frankaus: g'day all|pg||
nt|kaapo: North may get to open here, unless West finds 1@H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@C|pg||
nt|joemanjo: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcphee: need to reach 5@D |pg||
nt|chick: is he known as a particularly slow player?  :)|pg||
nt|xenya: the 3@D preempt in the other room was overdoing it|pg||
mb|p|pc|cK|nt|varange: hi Frank|pg||
pc|c4|nt|kaapo: I suppose Johan and PO at least play 2-way club|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: chick, sundelin is known as one of the slowest swedish players ever... :)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mmmakela: N won't sell|pg||
nt|mdgraham: curious no 1@s overcall by North|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|kaapo: 2-way club, where 1@C shows either a strong hand or a weak notrump range, is often referred to as Swedish club|pg||
nt|joemanjo: 2@C and 2N take up valuable space to show a black two suiter.|pg||
nt|suketbombi: N-s have a good @S partial|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sA|nt|mmmakela: 14-16 Nt maybe?|pg||
nt|chick: certainly doesn't look like a hand that I would upgrade|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: 13-17NT from start, 2@D showed 13-15 without 4c major|pg||
nt|chick: :)|pg||
nt|mcphee: PO thinks his partners minor is @C:)|pg||
nt|chick: good thing I don't have a lot to do today then :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I am told NS play VERY sound overcalls - and it surely seems so|pg||
pc|s6|nt|kaapo: I guess 1NT = 14-16|pg||
nt|kaapo: Some might bid some number of diamonds as West|pg||
nt|kaapo: Even if East doesn't lead a club, he'll get another chance|pg||
nt|kaapo: Unless he ducks a spade|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: this board is wrong duplicated. Not much, but the ace of heart is located at east, not at south|pg||
nt|kaapo: Makes a little more sense then|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  single?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: south stole the 9 of D from east|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: so east holds 3253 with A7 in hearts|pg||
nt|kaapo: Mikael and Cilla are in the minority for Swedish experts: they don't play strong/2-way club|pg||
nt|kaapo: Their system of choice is short club with transfers|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|frankaus: @D lead would have proved troublesome|pg||
nt|xenya: well if he decided to treat has hand as balanced, it makes sense|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h6|nt|xenya: whether it is balanced is doubtful though|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|pg||
nt|chick: almost any lead gives away a trick|pg||
pc|hK|nt|kaapo: Well, unless the other room plays the board similarly distorted, this has to be canceled|pg||
nt|mmmakela: so S has 10982 in dias?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: it´s the same at all other tables.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: yes, south holds 10982 in @d|pg||
nt|suketbombi: a @C lead or shift wud restrict to 3 or else 4 makable|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jkmjanusz: Witam!|pg||
nt|vugraphzbf: witamy nowych komentatorów |pg||
nt|abunio: witamy z Gdanska :)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: ns play 2-way club Staffan? Carrot?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: 2@C asking for majors, 2@D relay with lots of different hands, 2@H/2@S/2NT/3@C/3@D invitational|pg||
nt|chick: and N puts him to the test immediately, before he can get any other info|pg||
nt|kaapo: Of couse he does have @DQ and might get a trick with it|pg||
nt|chick: but N still has to find the @DQ|pg||
nt|mcphee: sure, nice bold play before anyones knows what is up|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6@C makes but it's not great. It takes more than the heart finesse|pg||
pc|h5|nt|othered1: That's a *really* positional style|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
mc|11|nt|varange: choices choices|pg||

nt|kaapo: Here's an old convention card for NS. Could be that not much has changed: http://www.bridgeguys.com/pdf/CC/SylvanSundelin.pdf|pg||
nt|kaapo: But he had 1@S444 so he didn't really know what suit to pitch|pg||
nt|kaapo: Back in order here?|pg||
nt|col3435: oh, I wanted to see which diamond honour declarer would play!|pg||
nt|mdgraham: excellent 6@C slam NS|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C!|nt|col3435: a lot going on there, but I think declarer should foresee the result when pitching the heart|pg||

mb|2S|an| |nt|ryskiel_: Darl es Santerm...to jaka arabska nazwa? |pg||
nt|chick: 4-5 @S,   6 if he can find the @SQ|pg||
nt|kaapo: In the signals section it states: |pg||
nt|kaapo: "We may combine discouragement and suit preference when known (or may be assumed) to be long in a suit; a high odd card shows preference for a high suit, a high even card for a low ...|pg||
nt|kaapo: suit - occurs rarely even if we should remember."|pg||
nt|kaapo: Will EW find diamonds?|pg||
nt|suketbombi: ask singleton|pg||
nt|othered1: Once you open the south hand, you should have a good run at it, unless system gets in the way|pg||
mb|p|nt|jkmjanusz: Na drugom staole wygrali to 3BA|pg||

nt|varange: garbage stayman - with garbage|pg||
nt|frankaus: this may not play well|pg||

nt|mmmakela: no reason E shd bid 4 @S?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I also think 3@S is terrible|pg||
nt|suketbombi: atleast the effort is made here:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: I think 1@C is natural or balanced|pg||
nt|kaapo: And 1@H shows spades|pg||
nt|chick: which never works for me, but it seems to for everyone else :)|pg||
nt|frankaus: g'day all - |pg||
nt|varange: a clear violation of Burns' Law, Ralf?|pg||
nt|col3435: South must bid again here, but what?|pg||
nt|kaapo: EW might make 8 tricks in diamonds, so 5@D could be a reasonable save|pg||
nt|col3435: was difficult to do more though|pg||
nt|joemanjo: dbl worked |pg||
nt|xenya: agree -- double stands out|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Important for West to cover the @d 10|pg||

nt|suketbombi: now they enter murky waters|pg||
nt|mdgraham: a key moment in any slam auction is when you agree a trump suit |pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|frankaus: i see i missed a grand :(|pg||
nt|mmmakela: @S K and then|pg||
nt|kaapo: They didn't, and neither did the open room|pg||
nt|frankaus: well not real garbagge and not short in @C so i would not  use it here|pg||
nt|varange: yep|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes! 1nt is good enough|pg||
nt|varange: Burns' Law: As declarer, one should strive to have more trumps than one's opponents|pg||
nt|varange: in some ways easier if playing the big 2NT, SAYC style|pg||
nt|xenya: if E is weak, he can take remove to 3@S -- the position is quite clear adter W's initial pass |pg||
pc|s5|pc|sA|nt|burypies: ale Witek im namiesza³ |pg||
nt|kaapo: 3@D might be 17-19 NT with 4 spades - but just guessing|pg||
nt|mcphee: make 3N i think|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s2|pg||
nt|chick: not sure I would have led a trump on that auction|pg||
pc|d6|nt|kaapo: Without the double, North would bid 1@D to show 0-7. Difficult to tell what 1@S shows here|pg||
nt|suketbombi: got there :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well done - it looked as though that was touch-and-go for a moment|pg||
nt|othered1: Would be nice to know what their decision points were, but the result is just fine.|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dQ|nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Yuval Yener|pg||
nt|kaapo: Loser on loser play on the next spade?|pg||
nt|yuval10: hi all|pg||
nt|kaapo: Hi Yuval|pg||
nt|col3435: yeah, why not @sJ and run it if West follows low|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|chick: W might Q-ask |pg||
nt|kaapo: In case I was about right about the early bids, 3@H could be a re-tranafer and 3NT some kind of slam try follows by two cue bids|pg||
nt|kaapo: Fredin - Lindkvist had an even more straightforward sequence to 7@H|pg||
nt|col3435: but here west shows out, and if he allows the @h7 to score it's all over|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: west has the option of discarding 2 diamonds on the 3rd and 4th round of spade, denying the 6of H to score|pg||
nt|col3435: yep you're right|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ryskiel_: moimi prywatnymi faworytami s¹ licytacje sprzedajace te same walory po kilkakroæ|pg||
nt|kaapo: And 4@H could then be a "last train" kind of bid - still interested in slam but without a heart control|pg||
nt|kaapo: Apparently not much :)|pg||
nt|kaapo: So pitching a club here looks a reasonable plan|pg||
nt|yuval10: indeed|pg||
nt|col3435: hmm, there's too much to do though isn't there?|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 3@S showed a delayed support hence doubleton Honor and 4@H was quebid|pg||
nt|suketbombi: i assume|pg||
pc|hK|nt|burypies: ale Walerowicz 2 razy t¹ sam¹ kartê licytowa³|pg||
nt|mmmakela: E must consider the fact that in OR the most probable contract is 4 @S|pg||

pc|h2|nt|col3435: or, just not enough tricks|pg||

nt|ralfwil: he needed that entry!|pg||
nt|yuval10: despite all the efforts it seem like a dead end for declarer|pg||
pc|dK|nt|othered1: I'm told:  once singleton is shown, 2NT denies 3@s and 3@s denies 6@h|pg||

nt|chick: nope, but it might have|pg||
nt|varange: hi Rashed|pg||
nt|varange: it even makes 13 with a 3/2 break in diamonds|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Lucky layout for N-S in a spade contract. They can take 9 tricks|pg||
mb|2D|an| |nt|Walddk2: Maybe even 10|pg||
mb|3C|nt|kaapo: 4@S or 3NT here?|pg||
nt|kaapo: NS might end up at 4@H here|pg||
nt|mcphee: easy @S game, interesting to see how far N/S will push|pg||
nt|kaapo: 6@S could make but is missing two key cards|pg||
mb|3D|nt|chick: 4@H will look tasty to NS, but also to W |pg||
nt|ralfwil: first morning slam in @d|pg||
nt|col3435: perhaps South could bid 4@d over 3NT then.|pg||
nt|varange: I can see that N wouldnt be happy|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@S let through on board 2|pg||
nt|othered1: I guess north thinks this hand is too good for 15 point 1N.  I tend to agree|pg||
nt|suketbombi: the system is called Demicoma Destructive Minor Constructive Major|pg||
mb|3H|nt|kaapo: Difficult to play either after 5@D|pg||
nt|kaapo: Ah, weren't we linked with the other table before?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: No|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like a @h partial for EW will be played here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Open room crashed|pg||
nt|kaapo: Well, back in action now, anyway :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: or perhaps 2@s from N|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Sunil Varghese|pg||
mb|p|nt|varange: and hearts|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: hi all|pg||
mb|4H|nt|suketbombi: so 1D shows nothing about @Ds but atleast 1 or both Majors|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: Unlikely they'd get that high, though, unless really pushed|pg||
nt|mcphee: does the 2@S bid show game interest for @H?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: 2@S was pass/correct. |pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: 1@D, I believe, shows about 11-16 with 4+@D and an unbalanced hand|pg||
mb|5D|nt|chick: N will expect partner to have @s singleton|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: 10-15 actually|pg||
nt|mcphee: or just an invitation + for @H?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes, but @d is better|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: do i start with a Roland slam :) ?|pg||
mb|5H|nt|mmmakela: supp dbl in spades|pg||
nt|chick: do you suppose 1@H is transfer advance showing spades?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: y|pg||
nt|kaapo: Nyström made a slight overbid with 4@D, but his @DAQ had grown in strength over 3@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: Wrang explained the 4@D wrong it seems, 4@D showed game forcing without short D|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: with spade support of course|pg||
nt|kaapo: 2@D Multi, showing a weak two in either of the majors (or perhaps some strong hand)|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 1nt denies Major unless 4-3-3-3|pg||
nt|othered1: Nicely j udged lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Nothing wrong with this slam|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: actually a good slam... need only to find @Hq|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: Ok, some downgrading due to singleton J|pg||
nt|mmmakela: brb cig br|pg||
nt|kaapo: 2@D limits the hand further down?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: max 14-15 |pg||
nt|xenya: 10 tricks are available, yes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's around 50%, not bad at all|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: maybe even better with the 9 card fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: now @d are 2-2, but if 3-1?|pg||
nt|varange: better slams are those that make :)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mmmakela: E knew 4-3 spades but didn't have a better option|pg||

nt|varange: too much relief|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a correct point of view, but not fair in all aspects:)|pg||
nt|varange: <-- being facetious|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That's 53%, singleton queen or 2-2, but ....|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: maybe north shd have started a cuebid with 3@S|pg||
nt|suketbombi: can survive DD tuff tho|pg||
pc|dT|nt|vugraphzbf: to zadzwoñ do niego i powiedz :)|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: 4@H showed a good raise to 4@S|pg||
nt|kaapo: Perhaps West could bid a minor suit to suggest a maximum with hearts?|pg||
nt|kaapo: 8 teams remain in the top division so there's lot to play for even for Örebridgen. They're currently 6th, 4.5 VPs ahead of the 8th positioned team|pg||
nt|kaapo: You'll find running scores via http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_plugins/content/content.php?content.877|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sT|nt|frankaus: lots of good slams fails - and some bad ones make - i for 1 bid far to many  slams|pg||
pc|sA|nt|varange: how would one know when one bids too many slams?|pg||
nt|joemanjo: That lead is good. Now 10 wll be difficult.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In the other room, West doubled 2@S and his poor partner is now in 2NT, mercifully undoubled|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: wow u have the %s at the tip of your fingers Roland|pg||
nt|vugraphzck: miskey - play out of turn - claiming at the end|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, I know when to bid my 12.89% slams|pg||
nt|suketbombi: he has not much options unless he thinks @HS are 4-4|pg||
nt|suketbombi: he has to try the @S finnesse first to know his target of @D tricks|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|chick: no one did, this hand is a nightmare in any contract|pg||
nt|col3435: (and 5VPs ahead of 9th)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|vugraphzbf: bo tylko siê Wacek denerwuje :)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: well clubs are 3-2 and the A right|pg||
pc|sK|nt|kaapo: I'm not very fond of West's 2@S but perhaps that was another small deception: he was trying to convince NS they should go to 4@H|pg||
nt|othered1: Probably depends on what north things their lead style would imply here.    To my eyes, 7 is an interesting card|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|mcphee: one entry short to make 6 I think|pg||
pc|hT|nt|burypies: jak siê k³óci to widaæ ¿e nie kuma to po co dzwoniæ|pg||
nt|kaapo: Interesting treatment. I've seen someone use 4@C and 4@D here as support bids, one promising @D cue, the other denying|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h2|pc|h3|pg||
nt|kaapo: He could squeeze East if nothing else works (double dummy) :)|pg||
nt|mcphee: dble dummy yes, or last resort|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not sure about that low spade discard|pg||
pc|h4|nt|jkmjanusz: Ma trzy dojcia do sto³u - 11 lew powinno byc|pg||
nt|suketbombi: if he ducks this will get a @D back and has to decide|pg||
pc|d2|nt|chick: if so, it certainly worked :)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: will be -2|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h5|pg||
nt|kaapo: High cross-ruff for the defence|pg||
nt|yuval10: E will need to cash A@h before last @c|pg||
pc|hK|nt|chick: yes, and with @Hs right for EW, this hand will go down only 1 or 2 :)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: now big problems|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: i would say he had big problems from the start... :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: W is worried about 6 @s's from N, perhaps?|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hJ|nt|frankaus: hard to fault the action but a red game was missed here|pg||

nt|kaapo: That had some potential for our first swing board|pg||
nt|kaapo:  15 was push: down one in both rooms|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think you can make 6@S even on a trump lead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but then again maybe 3@H was weak|pg||
nt|mdgraham: told 3@H=4@H with 0-6 hcp.|pg||

nt|mdgraham: no singleton?|pg||
nt|othered1: do you repoen as easat?|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: Would you overcall 3@C?|pg||
nt|kaapo: Apparently 2@C is showing the majors|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: this one is nice 3N if they can bid it|pg||
nt|kaapo: Staffan does wisely and concentrates on the board actually being played. That's a good advice for any bridge player :)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: now tough for S|pg||
nt|frankaus: now the save|pg||
nt|kaapo: If NS are good guessers, they could make 4@S|pg||
nt|yuval10: 4@s looks like a fair-chance contract but both A@D offside and 4-1 trump will doom it|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: dbl or 2@C graham ?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, either could be right. 2@C has the advantage of bidding the good suit... |pg||
nt|suketbombi: 12-15 no major or 4-3-3-3 if there is a major|pg||
mb|d|nt|burypies: raz Witek siê pogubi³ na tej rozgrywce ale ogólnie naprawdê bardzo dobrze|pg||

nt|mmmakela: will W balance?|pg||
nt|chick: I would|pg||
nt|arvid: I would|pg||
nt|kaapo: I guess I would too|pg||
nt|kaapo: Unapparently 4@C is asking to pick a major|pg||
nt|frankaus: pass  at 50s would be my action 2|pg||
nt|mmmakela: not the expected one|pg||
nt|kaapo: 10 down = 500|pg||
nt|frankaus: -10  = 500|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 4 H dbld cheaper|pg||
nt|frankaus: yes but hard to  be certain its not 800|pg||
nt|mmmakela: come on after 4 @C!|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, win @SA, then ruff a @H and eventually there is a squeeze against S|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 2 @C for me anyday|pg||
nt|suketbombi: a trf to @C if superaccepted even 4@S on a carefull handling will make|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: The web site (mostly in Swedish) is here somewhere: http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_plugins/content/content.php?content.877|pg||
nt|kaapo: @S to queen, then run 7|pg||
nt|othered1: would be nice if west can bid 2@D for longer suit|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 2@C is majors  2@D pick yours|pg||
mb|4S|nt|chick: would you?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: after the pause is a club lead ethical?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: yes|pg||
nt|mcphee: lots down|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: no double no trouble :)|pg||
nt|kaapo: But just 50 each|pg||
nt|col3435: ok, I guess even on three rounds of diamonds declarer would probably go down there.|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: 2@D was some kind of Multi: showing a weak two bid in either major (or possibly some strong hand)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: they will land in 2@h now instead of 2@s, if S had opened with 1@s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: South has all the important cards. @CQJ and @HKQ|pg||
nt|othered1: Is south thinking of doing something?  Did north's original pass show some values?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jkmjanusz: Po przepuszczeniu @H Damy Kasprzak zmieni³ wista na @S !!|pg||
nt|kaapo: Apparently 2@H was a simple reverse, a little light but with nice 3-card support for partner and great controls|pg||
nt|kaapo: Diamond split is very cruel, in case they end up at some number of dimonds|pg||
nt|kaapo: What is the 1NT range here, Staffan?|pg||
nt|frankaus: 2@H will make so no real harm|pg||
nt|varange: the one is as good as the other?|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: not necessarily a pause... remember the operator cannot enter bids until both people on one side of the screen have bid|pg||
nt|varange: friendly breaks either way|pg||
nt|yuval10: if he guess it that would be something :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but double shows the three-suiter and is possibly more flexible, and would therefore score 10/10 in a bidding competition|pg||
nt|mdgraham: board 5 - game missed at othert table as well|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 2nt knowing there is a minor fit|pg||
nt|suketbombi: y e-w play Demicoma 1nt denies 4 card major unless 4-3-3-3|pg||
pc|cK|nt|kaapo: 14-16?|pg||

nt|mmmakela: if Lebens this promises values(3@C)|pg||

nt|mmmakela: still wd EW|pg||
nt|varange: you'd open the south hand 1@s Frank?|pg||
nt|varange: or 1NT?|pg||
nt|frankaus: many here include 5M332 in their NT range - klinger has  a great influence here a he recomends it|pg||
nt|xenya: but this is very double dummy|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @C is only 5-card - d is best|pg||
nt|hawe45:  D|pg||
nt|othered1: "Knowing" may be a bit strong, if south could have 4=3=3=3 with 4-card major|pg||
nt|suketbombi: ok but they got 4 for there 200|pg||
pc|cA|nt|chick: that's one advantage of not bidding clubs, don't give away the bad distribution|pg||
nt|kaapo: Of course would be more cruel still, if South had them|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: they play lebensohl|pg||
nt|chick: if it promises clubs, that's ok with N|pg||
nt|mcphee: :)|pg||
nt|chick: but with a nice heart fit, it is trouble, double or not|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|arvid: If east had the jack of diamonds 6@D would have been a very good slam|pg||
nt|kaapo: Wrang saw short clubs with partner and opts for the 4-3 @S game|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: We had a lost connection at the other table which means board  15 isnt scored properly. The result in the open room was 6@S made, which should give another 14imps for Team Zang|pg||
nt|chick: he must win the @SA, so can ruff two clubs with the small trumps|pg||
nt|mmmakela: making 13|pg||
nt|yuval10: either way EW can make 10 tricks in @h because of the 87 doubleton @d so -1 in 4@s isn't so bad|pg||
nt|joemanjo: yes, missed the qj of clubs|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but with these suit discrepancies I would bid 2@C - always a good overcall of 1@D|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes that is rare N is known to take chances|pg||
pc|d5|nt|mmmakela: so then very nice auction|pg||
nt|frankaus: will be nervous about the @D situation|pg||
nt|varange: the 8@h is a big card|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|varange: AQxxx isn't that flash anyway|pg||
nt|frankaus: yes  then i play garbage 2@C and puppet 3@C for all game going hands|pg||
nt|varange: ok|pg||
nt|varange: nice treatment|pg||
nt|col3435: can East just continue hearts here?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: yes he can|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: well he has only 3 carder @S and a very weak 4 card @H suit|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: easy on a @D lead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East will do very well to lead a spade here|pg||
nt|suketbombi: everyone is happy here|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mmmakela: well S never thinks with his 10-12.....|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: there are no screens |pg||
nt|mmmakela: against 2-way club most treat it as supposing the weak variation and W didn't bid after 1 @C so has clubs now if thinking one could assume|pg||
nt|mmmakela: even that was meant priv sry|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but, on the bidding, he may well do so - no, he has gone passive|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that's good - being happy is better than being miserable|pg||

nt|vugraphzck: yes...dummy played before his own turn|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: play 2 @C and then the 2nd @H|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: but east can take the @Ha and clear @H|pg||

mb|3H|nt|chick: E was about to bid spades, so now will he try his diamonds, or will he hide in the bushes and ambush a spade contract?|pg||

nt|chick: and S violates rule  1 of preempts .... don't bid again unless forced.   But with 6-6, I can see the temptation|pg||
nt|kaapo: In the end, PO went one down and lost 12 IMPs|pg||

nt|kaapo: Sylvan keeps getting a lot of diamonds|pg||
nt|mmmakela: I would bid 6|pg||
nt|frankaus: Aces and singleton a re great combination|pg||
nt|varange: 4@sE in the OR|pg||
nt|varange: and another interesting layout ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzck: players taking a break|pg||
nt|suketbombi: could be that vital imp to texan aces here|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes 2 smokers there|pg||
nt|othered1: another easy game, likely making 4 since there's no clear reason to guess trumps correctly|pg||
nt|othered1: And no reason to overbid, unless somehow @D are thought to provide tricks|pg||
nt|suketbombi: auction will be 1@H- 2@H  and W will settle for 4|pg||

nt|vugraphzck: resuming play|pg||
mb|p|nt|joemanjo: hmm 1@c?|pg||
nt|xenya: note that 3!N has no play even if @Cs are 2-2|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|kaapo: 1NT seems fine on the East cards|pg||
nt|chick: maybe he's a girl's best friend :)|pg||
nt|kaapo: 1@D is about 11-16 with 4+@D and suggests an unbalanced hand|pg||
nt|mcphee: 19 @S nice card for S hand|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: shall i ask him cornelia? :)|pg||
nt|kaapo: Surprising no pre-empt from N|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  so, @c and some strenght against @s and distribution |pg||
nt|suketbombi: the old trusted 3nt best here for N-S|pg||
mb|1H|nt|chick: 3 good spades|pg||
nt|kaapo: East has an interesting opening bid choice|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes he decided to underbid this|pg||
mb|p|nt|col3435: on bd6, if East continued hearts, declarer would probably play another club with West showing out. Then west would be marked with all the cards in spades and diamonds, and it seems ...|pg||
nt|col3435: declarer could throw him in|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North has plenty to raise to 2@S|pg||

nt|chick: asking partner to bid 3@C|pg||
nt|kaapo: Or perhaps a transfer to clubs|pg||
nt|mcphee: 10@S I mean|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  EW reached their limit, what about NS?|pg||
nt|suketbombi: Jm has not finished:(|pg||
nt|othered1: but west has done more and east has a maximum, so|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: would you show majs or treat S hand as 1-suiter|pg||
nt|xenya: strange pass by S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: You can understand why South bids 3@D, even though imho it is an overbid |pg||
nt|suketbombi: ashim will stick? any way 4nt makes too|pg||
nt|suketbombi: will attack with @Ds knowing Thak|pg||
mb|p|nt|varange: can you explain Ralf?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: still, push-em-up|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ...onward and possibly upward.... |pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes K bendre is Kaustub Bendre and in Kibz bendre is his father|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: and direct 3 @C promising pos values|pg||
nt|chick: "transfer" implies that you have the suit.   in this case, it's more like a "relay" to clubs, with many possible hands|pg||
nt|kaapo: East had a very maximal hand and support for whatever suit West has and tries for game|pg||
nt|mmmakela: tries?|pg||
nt|kaapo: True, Cornelia, but many play real transfers in this position|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: East though seems unaware of that his partner has made a lebensohl bid |pg||
nt|kaapo: Your using keyboard input, Staffan?|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  juicy 200?|pg||
nt|vugraphzck: S thinking hard|pg||
nt|suketbombi: in good time|pg||

nt|suketbombi: 11|pg||
nt|vugraphzck: N-E discussing|pg||

pc|d5|nt|abunio: sorry, private|pg||
nt|burypies: w jakim kierunku zmierzaja?|pg||
nt|chick: majors|pg||
nt|kaapo: @S lead will bring the 8th trick|pg||
nt|kaapo: And if there are 8 there are 9, as the saying goes :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, it's teams, so not that important - as long as South is not tempted to bid 3@S|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|jkmjanusz: A ³adsna? Warto dzwoniæ?|pg||
nt|chick: in competitive bidding, I think need to give as many options to partner as you can|pg||
nt|kaapo: 800 may have been very expensive, because EW's 4@S didn't seem easy at all|pg||
nt|kaapo: 1@C strong - 1@D weak|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: yes, but looking at the wrong hand as well... :)|pg||
nt|varange: says he, belatedly :)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  S could expect partner with relatively long @c and @h|pg||
nt|vugraphzck: oh ok|pg||
pc|d7|nt|abunio: nie, do mojej mamy:)|pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: O, sorry...|pg||

nt|ralfwil: no! |pg||
nt|col3435: very much so :)|pg||
nt|col3435: nice though|pg||
nt|varange: yes|pg||
nt|xenya: double showed @Hs -- it would seem natural to bid your @S at that point|pg||
nt|othered1: Maybe the overcall will help west get trumps right|pg||
nt|othered1: for the requisite 1 imp per board|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|chick: ok, but that's not lebensohl (for the benefit of kibs)|pg||
nt|kaapo: Yes, good to make the distinction clear|pg||
nt|mmmakela: not true Kaapo, most play leb here|pg||
nt|mcphee: this game may go down|pg||
nt|kaapo: As you see, D and S are adjacent on the keyboard. Easy to make "typos" if using keyboard input when operating :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: yeah, and all 13 cards are next to eachother so it´s easy to have a "clickos" for that :)|pg||
nt|mcphee: @C lead bad for the N hand|pg||
nt|kaapo: Well, you've been doing marvellously well :)|pg||
nt|varange: :) dang|pg||
nt|ralfwil: perhaps some kind of transfer|pg||
nt|varange: it seems that way|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: no alert on 1NT at least so I dont think they play it as transfer|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes and a singleton @D lead may confirm the trump position for OT|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mmmakela: N likes the lead but...|pg||
nt|col3435: good prediction - spade lead didn't look clear to me|pg||
pc|s5|nt|chick: as long as EW cash their minor winners, this cannot make|pg||
nt|kaapo: Some might use Lebensohl here. If it's in use, then South's 3@D shows some values; he'd bid 2NT with a very weak hand|pg||
nt|varange: wow|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mmmakela: I hate playing in 4-2 when 6-1 was available(ok extreme case but 4-3 is probable)|pg||
pc|s7|pg||

nt|kaapo: @DJ would suffer the same, too|pg||
pc|s8|nt|chick: often opponents will compete, taking partner off the hook|pg||
nt|mmmakela: so 1-suiter for me|pg||
nt|suketbombi: he is inducing Thak to cash his @H or underlead it:(|pg||
pc|s3|nt|chick: and even if 4-2, opps cannot double (else you run to hearts)|pg||
nt|varange: then the DBL must have some unknown meaning|pg||
nt|varange: how would S interpret the 3@d|pg||
nt|suketbombi: sure imp for texans|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|sT|nt|arvid: even if south is showing some values with 3@D I think his hand is too good|pg||
nt|col3435: yeah, and club is worse!|pg||
pc|sA|nt|chick: and to paraphrase your comment:   I hate playing in a 6-1 when 4-4 was available :)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: any opinions from kibs? majors or 1-suiter?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  small club from table?|pg||
nt|suketbombi: oops what was that play of @Sa?|pg||
pc|s6|nt|kaapo: Most do, but many don't :)|pg||

pc|d3|nt|kaapo: Nystöm could give a ruff but he would then lose his natural @C trick|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: yeah, but that would force south to ruff a club |pg||
nt|kaapo: Seems to end +1 either way|pg||

pc|h4|nt|abunio: 36 boards, 3 segments, 12 boards each|pg||

nt|yuval10: follows by 6@c over 5@d |pg||
nt|yuval10: quite hard|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: Many would open the South hand nowadays. Surprising to see a strong clubber pass it|pg||
nt|frankaus: not many would pass|pg||
nt|col3435: I thought it was because he didn't feel the hand was good enough with a misfit, but evidently it was more because he wanted the penalty|pg||
nt|vasanti: does 4 hcp warrant a bid?|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: 1@C was either balanced or natural|pg||
nt|othered1: @D split makes 4@S a potential problem|pg||
nt|mdgraham: could this be 6@S in one room and 2@S in the other.....|pg||
pc|cK|nt|kaapo: 2@D looks like natural, nonforcing call|pg||

nt|kaapo: Wow, a natural system played in Swedish premmier league!|pg||
nt|yuval10: pass, if forcing, is very good by S|pg||

nt|col3435: don't see how North can bid it|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  :-)|pg||
nt|othered1: I'd guess that in CR the NS *Know* they have a bad result . . .|pg||
nt|mdgraham: superficially, yes :) but one result is worse than the other, depending on your point of view  |pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  what is the probability of finding all 13 cards?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not sure|pg||
pc|sA|nt|col3435: well, like that, evidently :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: after Pass by S i think she MUST bid it|pg||
nt|kaapo: By eptying the box save 7@S and 7NT|pg||
nt|col3435: if pass is forcing|pg||
nt|yuval10: the play will be interesting...... she might know that W has only 3 @s's from the bid|pg||
nt|yuval10: she can ruff 2 @d's..... and see that E has 3|pg||
nt|kaapo: Has West still something to think about?|pg||
nt|yuval10: then 8-1-3-1|pg||
pc|s7|nt|chick: its not impossible that S will switch to spades, hoping to remove the entry to diamonds|pg||
nt|kaapo: North seems to have a chance for 10 tricks, if he raises the heart suit first|pg||
nt|yuval10: i belive she'll make it|pg||
nt|yuval10: sry HE will make it|pg||
nt|yuval10: because S is declarer|pg||
nt|kaapo: Cilla might make a comment about him never presenting a good dummy, and her showing an example :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: i think S will like the dummy he'll see :)  he knows it's a reasonable grand, now only have to make!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I think he will|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Would Haglund bid 6@S with @CQx?|pg||
nt|suketbombi: here too they wud think 10 imps gone|pg||
pc|s8|nt|burypies: czasami nawet Witek ma piki|pg||
nt|kaapo: Apparently their 2NT opening was something like 22-24|pg||
nt|mmmakela: -1|pg||
nt|kaapo: So 2@C followed by 2NT would be say 20-21|pg||

nt|vugraphzpx: might endplay North|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|cT|nt|xenya: lucky layout for EW|pg||
pc|c7|nt|mdgraham: looks like 4@c was an auto-splinter (a splinter agreeing my suit), but the values outside are quite soft|pg||
nt|mdgraham: incidentally, that last board - why did East play a club back after the @SA?|pg||
pc|d2|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|mmmakela: yes although obvious many wouldn't make it|pg||
pc|h6|nt|kaapo: Still more IMPs for Skalman on boards 19 (stopped at 3@S) and 20 (3NT went down)|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|nt|mmmakela: next a club and then N must find H switch|pg||

pc|d3|nt|yuval10: @h to T, A@d and @d ruff|pg||

nt|ralfwil: "who says that crime doesn´t pay" from Bridge in the menagery (about Hidgeous Hog)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|kaapo: I'd have guessed North would open 1NT. Perhaps they play 15-17 1NT in third and fourth seat|pg||
nt|chick: and a non-transfer runout|pg||
nt|joemanjo: when in doubt ...|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|vugraphzpx: they play 14-16NT. Dont know why Olof didnt go for 1NT|pg||
nt|kaapo: Fredin - Lindkvist also missed the slam on board 7, playing at the 5 level...|pg||
nt|kaapo: However it was doubled, with an overtrick|pg||
nt|kaapo: Which was worth 11 IMPs, as you can see in the movie|pg||

nt|kaapo: Would anyone try 3@C as North?|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: Hmm, have they incorporated transfers into the system?|pg||
nt|kaapo: 2@S might show something like 8-12 here|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: 10-13|pg||
nt|vasanti:  anybody 4 4sp?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Walddk4: If he had a long minor instead of a major, it would be a psyche, but 1@H surely was not|pg||
nt|kaapo: That seems to be a raising trend in Sweden|pg||
nt|chick: no dummy-time naps :)|pg||
nt|col3435: club lead?|pg||
pc|s8|nt|kaapo: Very standard bidding here|pg||

nt|yuval10: thanks all|pg||
pc|h6|nt|kaapo: Perhaps there's case for playing 5@C here too? Or 4@H|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jkmjanusz: A, nie: zagrali vtylko 3@H|pg||
nt|abunio: chyba, ze drugi stol co postawi z paleczka|pg||

nt|varange: that heart lead wasn't at all obvious|pg||

nt|xenya: looks like NS can make 8 tricks in spades... -- perhaps on a different lead|pg||
pc|s7|nt|chick: should make this easily, even with the @HQ off|pg||
nt|kaapo: NS lack some aces to bring this home|pg||
pc|s3|pc|h4|pc|sQ|pg||
