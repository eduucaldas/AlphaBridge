nt|burry1975: 6spades very reasonable contract. |pg||
mb|2D!|mb|d!|nt|imp_jan: how high will north bid now?|pg||
nt|imp_jan: 3@S?|pg||
nt|daman: getting to 6@S should be easy enough|pg||
nt|daman: but will go down as well|pg||
mb|3H|an|*|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|4N!|nt|burry1975: easier for south to find the winning lead against slam here|pg||
nt|imp_jan: now there is a chance of gertting the spades right|pg||
nt|daman: right|pg||
nt|burry1975: after 2d opening spades will be guessed correctly|pg||
nt|imp_jan: unless you get a club ruff of course|pg||
nt|daman: same chance in the CR|pg||
nt|burry1975: yes thats what i mean. for north its more difficult|pg||
nt|daman: S was marked with short @Ss|pg||

nt|andersk: Im just happy that the previous board was easy to declear:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: Remarkable how (semi-)professional players don't flinch at a board like this, but the worse the players get, the worse their reaction to such a result|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: TD has been called by Paulissen again|pg||
nt|jeanhari: I think line of play in pairs depends on position in a tournament,  do you want to gamble|pg||
nt|jeanhari: nice 6 of a major here|pg||
nt|xenya: and the score is correct this time|pg||
nt|vugraphzbt: they're in 3n by W now|pg||
nt|henryb: I suspect they are on board 4 or 5 already|pg||
mb|1H|mb|2H!|nt|sybarra: now what? |pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: The playing speed :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: Time penalties have been issued, so players are more careful now|pg||
nt|jeanhari: and a profitable save|pg||
mb|5H|nt|xenya: not the most exciting contract|pg||
nt|sharkey: Hi everyone|pg||
mb|6S|nt|rnmalik: what a board- a GS on @S hook but 6 sure-lets see|pg||
nt|sybarra: and do you take the save as n/s?  |pg||
nt|sybarra: pass quietly and hope no further more my W?|pg||
nt|jeanhari: 5@C - 5@H - 6@S ?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: save will take EW to 7:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: no further *move |pg||
nt|jeanhari: or @H|pg||
nt|sharynr: South's 5@h putting it to the opps right away to make a decision|pg||
mb|p|nt|burry1975: 4s for NS here, this should be a quick one too|pg||
mb|p|nt|jeanhari: interesting 5@D bid?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharynr: they could get a club ruff on defence here|pg||
pc|cA|nt|nigel_k:  South has good playing strength for a multi|pg||
nt|xenya: no names of the players yet -- let's be patient|pg||
nt|xenya: ah ther they are|pg||
nt|rnmalik: :)|pg||
nt|sharynr: but without that, declarer will have to guess spades|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|pc|c4|pg||
nt|sybarra: surprised not a @c bid arent you?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: even @H|pg||
nt|jeanhari: well done by Bertens, Verhees is gonna regret bidding on|pg||
nt|jeanhari: indeed|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: Wow, N can almost count to a profitable save, white vs red...|pg||
nt|sybarra: N doesnt know about the clubs |pg||
nt|xenya: 4@H for NS and a @D save EW -- but the bidding didn't go that way|pg||
pc|c6|nt|sybarra: pard kept him in the dark |pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: Bertens just asked me to change the auction :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: Then apologized and said he thought about 7|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  So North didn't realize that 4@h is making and he needed to double 4@s|pg||
pc|c7|nt|sybarra: unlikely this hand will be played at lightening speed|pg||
nt|sharkey: This cud make with the fiendly @D break I think|pg||
nt|sharkey: N has several options|pg||
nt|sharynr: a spec advised south to bid 4 or 5 @C to pinpoint shortness, a reasonable idea|pg||
pc|s4|nt|Vugraphzbt: (According to the TD there wasn't a problem)|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|xenya: double would be dangerous i think|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  If South had a typical @hAQxxxx and nothing else, the double would be wrong probably|pg||
nt|xenya: N couldn't rely on S to have 2 tricks  |pg||
nt|xenya: a spectator points out that the score should be the other way -- it's Onstein 172|pg||
pc|d5|nt|sybarra: not sure that @D break is all that friendly however nice of E not to have another club|pg||
nt|sybarra: Bas,  what venue are you play at?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: NBB office|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Maybe a 1@h opening would have worked out better|pg||
nt|vugraphzbt: that's right|pg||
pc|dA|nt|jeanhari: indeed was a very lazy 4@S-bid |pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d3|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sharkey: Have to decide on which red suit|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|h3|pg||
nt|sybarra: now making pard feel better and just making 6 |pg||
nt|xenya: and the double might give the show away -- i mean the trump position|pg||
pc|s5|nt|Vugraphzbt: This was my bad, I must've entered it wrong because S actually bid 5@C...|pg||
pc|s7|nt|sharkey: Not the kind of start Witte huis need|pg||
pc|s8|nt|nigel_k:  Good decision by North. Many players would have passed 3NT but the bad spade suit is actually more suited to 4@s spades than 3NT.|pg||
nt|sharkey: de Wijs knows W wud duck with @HA|pg||
nt|sharkey: @H9 first time...|pg||
pc|h4|pg||

nt|imp_jan: we (Dutch players) will all read yr column tonight on the internet, Burry|pg||
mb|2S|an|*|nt|burry1975: lets see if I will become persona non grata to more people|pg||
nt|imp_jan: and enjoy yr first analyses and conclusions as well as the fielding of the Dutch open team for the EC in Oostende |pg||
nt|burry1975: the list is rapidly growing|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|imp_jan: lol|pg||

mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|nt|daman: not the best contract|pg||
nt|imp_jan: 4n now by north|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Should Paulissen had looked for a heart fir with KJx in spades when partner also announced a spade stopper?|pg||
nt|burry1975: but I hope he will give drijver-groenenboom a chance|pg||
nt|daman: xx?|pg||
nt|imp_jan: dont have uch sympathize for north's stayman|pg||
nt|daman: 4NT would be a smart bid|pg||
nt|imp_jan: much|pg||
nt|Walddk4: That makes us two|pg||
nt|imp_jan: and the rest, Ro|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|burry1975: or redouble knowing you need the points?|pg||
nt|imp_jan: btw is 4@H down?|pg||
mb|r|mb|p|nt|burry1975: double by brink not a clever bid if you know you're 40 something up|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Did that redouble come after a long tank by Paulissen?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Must be for business|pg||
pc|hA|nt|burry1975: that redouble by jansma is.... I don't care if i lose by 100|pg||
nt|daman: and the fans go wild....|pg||
pc|h2|nt|imp_jan: Jansma's famous last bid, before he dies|pg||
nt|imp_jan: REDOUBLE|pg||
nt|daman: on his tombstone|pg||
nt|daman: on this side of the pond we just say RE|pg||
pc|s7|pc|h7|pg||
nt|burry1975: i know a jansma double:-) |pg||
nt|Walddk4: The contract seems infragible|pg||
nt|burry1975: well a lot of work still to be done, but there are chances to make |pg||
nt|Walddk4: infrangible even|pg||
nt|daman: a Mike Gold word|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Everything sitting well for declarer except the 5-0 heart split|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|nt|Walddk4: @S10x too|pg||
nt|burry1975: but as pointed out by kibitzers, east will feel the pain of discarding on the hearts|pg||
nt|burry1975: Jan are you going to make an article like you did about the bermuda bowl?|pg||
nt|daman: that was a very perilous double|pg||
nt|burry1975: the festival of unforced errors? Or don't you have so many pages available?:-)|pg||
pc|d2|pc|h9|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h8|nt|imp_jan: well all 82 hands will be published in the IMP of March, almost all highly interesting|pg||

pc|hT|pg||
pc|dA|nt|daman: were there not 84 hands?|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d5|pc|d4|pg||
nt|imp_jan: + 2 :)|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d9|nt|burry1975: yes but the other two didnt have unforced errors:-)|pg||

pc|s2|pc|s5|pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
nt|imp_jan: so it seems west will make only his 3 trumps|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Jan will try @SQx with West first and if no luck take the C finesse|pg||
pc|d3|nt|imp_jan: diamond??|pg||
pc|h3|nt|Walddk4: Works well|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c3|pg||

pc|c8|pc|cT|pc|cA|pc|c2|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h6|pc|sJ|pc|c9|pg||
pc|c7|nt|burry1975: but i gues he will play for the drop of the Q now|pg||
nt|daman: uh oh|pg||
pc|c4|nt|Walddk4: He could play for the squeeze though|pg||
nt|daman: he did play for the squeeze|pg||
nt|burry1975: it was a good ten of clubs by drijver|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Drijver could have been genuinely squeezed|pg||
nt|daman: one could say    that this is the match|pg||
nt|burry1975: but he knows drijver is good enough to play the ten. I think based on the double he should finesse. but its like 51 49|pg||
nt|Walddk4: He should not attention to the 10 against a player like Drijver|pg||
nt|Walddk4: pay attention|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It does not change the odds|pg||
nt|burry1975: well decision to extend the match else we can all grab a beer and watch sven kramer|pg||
nt|imp_jan: anyway, jansma likes to play the audience a bit, even when he loses|pg||
nt|Vugraph814: He's doing that right now :)|pg||
nt|Vugraph814: "@C9, @CT, not nice"|pg||
nt|burry1975: another thing is that brink might have played a club instead of a spade when he ruffed the diamond|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|pg||
nt|imp_jan: OHWWW|pg||
nt|daman: good night|pg||

nt|burry1975: war and peace:-)|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok|pg||
nt|sybarra: that makes more sense  |pg||
nt|jeanhari: easy 4@S, NS missing diamond control|pg||
nt|sybarra: and not only game on the @D  ruff|pg||
nt|xenya: so just 1 off undoubled -- could be a swing |pg||
nt|xenya: what a freak|pg||
mb|p|nt|burry1975: in which the White House eliminated all|pg||
nt|sybarra: I suspect the TD has spoken about "lets pick up the pace boys" |pg||
mb|1C!|nt|sharkey: 4@H looks normal for NS - unless W bids the suit first|pg||
mb|1H|nt|xenya: hard to predict where all that will end|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  If 4@c is a two suiter, North can probably just bid 5@h now|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|xenya: nice|pg||
mb|p|nt|burry1975: 4 hearts look playable here|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - friendly @C break helps|pg||
nt|xenya: i tend to agree|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Maybe South will bid again though|pg||
nt|sharynr: is this a transfer|pg||
nt|sharkey: or some kind positive hand|pg||
nt|sharkey: Operator - can you find out what 2@D mean?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|nigel_k:  The other table is playing board 1 now so we should start to see comparisons|pg||
nt|burry1975: interesting detail is that de wijs muller played the round robin in a different team (onstein 2)|pg||
mb|p|nt|burry1975: but they were promoted to the first squad after that |pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: "I have a very "suited" hand for you p", Jansma said|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: "Void again, huh", Paulissen said|pg||
nt|jeanhari: S will make a move now|pg||
nt|xenya: N might leave the double in?|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: no -- well done|pg||
mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  I think North has quite good cards for offence opposite a red two suiter and no certain defence|pg||
nt|xenya: hopefully we'll have no more breakdowns|pg||
nt|rnmalik: hope so:)|pg||
nt|xenya: good stop|pg||
nt|vugraphzbt: should be fine now :)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|sharkey: kib says balanced 8+|pg||
nt|sharynr: i wonder if 4@H would have made, but this looks like a good contract now|pg||
nt|sharkey: Things going Onstein's way here|pg||
pc|h8|nt|sybarra: and a likely @D  lead will pick up that suit and so it is |pg||
nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
pc|s4|nt|rnmalik: 2@H DBL was also profitable for NS|pg||
nt|sharkey: 4@H may make I think - if you take the "right" black finesse|pg||
nt|sharynr: i think you are right, even if they are able to lead AK and another @H|pg||
nt|sharkey: easier for us to make it :)|pg||
nt|sharynr: always|pg||
nt|sharynr: of course, talking about how many tricks in a @H game, that would mean 1@HX would go for quite a ride!|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|xenya: but the game is just on a finesse|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|pc|dT|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|sharynr: was the spade 4 encouraging discard by east?|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h2|nt|jeanhari: not easy to look for a way te defeat a cold game|pg||
pc|s5|pc|hT|pg||
pc|hA|nt|burry1975: suddenly he's the whirlwind:-)|pg||
nt|sharkey: hope Bas can keep up :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: Barely|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: The slower they play the harder, you have to be focused without having anything to do|pg||
nt|xenya: 4-0 trump split is a nuisance but can be overcome|pg||
nt|sharkey: If S opens a 15-17 NT W may not enter into the bidding with 5332 and OR may end up in 4@H|pg||
pc|h4|nt|xenya: 6@C would have been a correct save here|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sharkey: think you jinxed him Frank |pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|h3|nt|burry1975: 5s X on board 2 is duplicated in the open room|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|sharkey: E is feeling the pressure|pg||
pc|c5|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|sharynr: east feeling a bit of discomfort|pg||
nt|sharynr: maybe the club ace and king, then the intrafinesse in spades?|pg||
nt|sharkey: @CA and finesse and rest of the tricks|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c9|pc|cA|pc|c2|pg||
pc|c7|nt|burry1975: paulissen shouldnt try to finesse in spades now else an extra undertrick|pg||
nt|sharynr: yes that is safe, since west would not get in|pg||
nt|sharkey: E squeezed |pg||
nt|sharynr: the intra finesse only for the newspapers|pg||
nt|sharkey: they always work there!|pg||
nt|sharynr: does west have a problem on this trick?|pg||
nt|sharkey: may be connection problems?|pg||
nt|sharynr: natalia?|pg||
nt|sharkey: apparently - kib says we've had several|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cJ|pc|cT|pg||

nt|Vugraphzbt: Hey PO :)|pg||
nt|burry1975: they may be pushed there ...|pg||
nt|po-s: 7D on spade lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: I don't know what the TD has said, it all took place outside of the play room. However, Paulissen has bid 2@S|pg||
nt|burry1975: de wijs duly agreed with 1D:-) now they should try to get 3n in his hand|pg||
nt|burry1975: only down with club lead I think|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  At the other table on board 17 South did open 1@h and they doubled 4@s for 300 and 6 imps|pg||
nt|xenya: strong @C?|pg||
nt|sharkey: White House still 41 IMPs behand - they need some swing boards|pg||
nt|sharynr: a very hungry 1@S bid here|pg||
nt|sharkey: 1@C strong|pg||
nt|sharynr: perhaps as you said Carl, looking for action|pg||
nt|sharkey: Interference at any price Sharyn - team need IMPs|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes|pg||
nt|sharkey: 6@D actually makes|pg||
nt|sharynr: never wil be bid though|pg||
nt|sharkey: or may get Dbl for big numbers|pg||
nt|sharkey: W will also have a say with 4 x @S|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|sybarra: 2 @C=  weak with @D |pg||
nt|sybarra: (or stong)  but we know better|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 4@H makeable?|pg||
nt|xenya: yes it is i'm told|pg||
nt|sharynr: will north leave DBL in if south does it|pg||
mb|3S|nt|burry1975: indeed 7 on a spade lead, 3d on a club lead|pg||
nt|burry1975: heart is probably good enough too.... |pg||
nt|xenya: NS can make a few tricks in a heart contract here|pg||
nt|sharynr: ouch|pg||
nt|sharynr: east now wiggling in his seat, i am sure|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|sybarra: someone may X this |pg||
nt|xenya: and they are going to get to 4|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3@S means?|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: the only winning defence against 4@H is 3 rounds of spades -- unlikely to be found|pg||
nt|xenya: i may be wrong, sorry |pg||
nt|nigel_k:  West now choosing between 4NT and 5@d|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  5@d will be easier as North is endplayed even if you get clubs wrong|pg||
nt|xenya: yes|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  In 4NT the spade finesse is the tenth trick but declarer may not wish to play for that|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzbt: @C lead not unlikely by W|pg||
nt|sharynr: sigh of relief heard all the way in canada|pg||
nt|sharkey: lol|pg||
pc|s8|pc|c6|nt|sharkey: W's 4@C rather aggressive I think - @S lead called for|pg||
nt|xenya: that would be definitely against the odds -- but is there another chance|pg||
nt|xenya: my guess it's hearts |pg||
pc|sJ|nt|sharkey: not easy from Qxx|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure @S lead with qxx comes to mind |pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry for the echo |pg||
nt|sharkey: If E has the guts to risk @C finesse...|pg||
nt|burry1975: if he has...he can make|pg||
nt|sharkey: think off 1|pg||
nt|sybarra: club finesses and he can...."all in"  as they say in poker |pg||
nt|sharkey: indxeed|pg||
nt|sharkey: ruff 2 @D and 2 @S losers|pg||
nt|sharkey: plus 2 red losers|pg||
nt|burry1975: use the 4th club to draw trumps|pg||
nt|sybarra: well we probably have time to get coffee while he thinks |pg||
nt|sybarra: brb|pg||
nt|sharkey: may be dinner too...|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Anyway the club lead will not test declarer too much|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|xenya: i wonder why N chose that lead -- it seemed S's double was not penalty |pg||
pc|d2|nt|rnmalik: Yep transfer to @H|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dQ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|xenya: another tricky contract|pg||
pc|s9|nt|rnmalik: would you DBL 2@D or bid 2@S|pg||
nt|rnmalik: requires play|pg||
pc|sA|nt|jeanhari: 4@H cold but the bidding was not that strange|pg||
nt|jeanhari: I think most will bid 2@S|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: Would probably X, though 2@S gets kudos too, in my book|pg||
pc|s2|pc|h4|pg||
nt|xenya: right|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|nt|burry1975: 300 is a bargain|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c2|pg||
nt|burry1975: well...he decided not too....now down 2|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I have done my best but cannot count to 10 tricks:)|pg||
nt|sharkey: It will be very difficult for NS to bid @D slam as N has ½ his HCP in pd's void suit so likely will this board be a push.  On the other hand, White House needs action...|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dT|nt|xenya: i'm still trying|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sharkey: getting short in trumps too|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|d4|nt|sharkey: OR also bid 6@S Bd 17 so no damage|pg||
nt|sharynr: pressure coming on east now|pg||
pc|h5|pc|dJ|nt|sybarra: he may ruff and lead a sp now |pg||
nt|sybarra: or any old shoe = -1 |pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I would DBL and still have a rebid in @S|pg||
pc|d8|nt|rnmalik: 2@S and a @D cannot be avoided|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like only 9|pg||
nt|xenya: yes |pg||
nt|vugraphzbt: sorry, we'll need to restart again after this board. sorry for the inconvenience|pg||
nt|xenya: this may well be a push -- 4@H looks a decent contract and should be reached in th OR too i think|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sharynr: and bid the game on the second board|pg||

nt|po-s: unless North gets to bid diamonds|pg||
nt|vugraphzbt: Bakkeren claimed when Jansma was wondering what to do|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: here comes a club sequence... |pg||
nt|burry1975: open room was in 3nt here, west doubled and now ns are in 4clubs|pg||
nt|sybarra: Jan may bid 4 @S |pg||
nt|sybarra: quickly get in the way |pg||
nt|sharkey: not sure at these colors|pg||
mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  I'm not sure what South's double was as the clubs were unlikely to ever run and he had some cards in partner's suits|pg||
nt|sharkey: so still possibilities|pg||
mb|1D!|an|12-14 bal or 10-15:both minors, 6+!d|nt|burry1975: true, you need to play SAPP to bid that one:-)|pg||
nt|sybarra: Jan is white,  why should he wait?|pg||
nt|sybarra: 1 @S= 1n?|pg||
nt|jeanhari: can make 5@D or NT here|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: One note for the last board, 5@D is a good save against 2@S :)|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Maybe just hoping to win trick one and play a major through West|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sharynr: 2NT?|pg||
nt|sharkey: 1@S may not be everybody's choise VUL and 41 IMPs ahead|pg||
nt|sharynr: can always used the "I was a passed hand excuse"|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|nigel_k:  Yes much harder by North and 6@d instead of 5NT is possible|pg||
nt|jeanhari: 5@D more probably to reach|pg||
nt|jeanhari: :)|pg||
nt|xenya: trap hand for NS|pg||
mb|p|nt|jeanhari: that was too fast for my typing|pg||
mb|3N|nt|sharkey: 3 NT may be not an option anymore - doesnt mind defending minor suit|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Not sure what sort of hand 3NT indicates in their methods but it doesn't look that attractive with 4405 shape and understandably hard for South to pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|nigel_k:  They may still be ok in 4NT or 5@c if they can stop|pg||
mb|p|nt|jeanhari: is was vulnerable|pg||
nt|sybarra: we may just see a claim |pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzbt: LOL, Bertens shuffled, said 600 and everyone agreed|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: Didn't even show his cards|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sharkey: 3 NT is an option....|pg||
nt|xenya: 6@C is excellent, looking at NS's hands|pg||
nt|sharkey: Why didnt E bid 2 NT?|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|burry1975: 3nt is highly likely made due to the friendly heart position|pg||
nt|sharkey: indeed|pg||
pc|s8|nt|xenya: on a good day, you might even make 7|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  After the 1@h overcall it still isn't bad but I don't know if I'd want to be there|pg||
nt|xenya: and it looks like 6@C can be made here despite the 5-0 trump split|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|sharkey: doesnt have enough transportation i think|pg||
nt|xenya: it looks like a very good 4@S -- i wonder what stopped them from reaching it|pg||
nt|sharkey: or 3?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sybarra: I dont think he can do it |pg||
nt|burry1975: just enough...as long as you dare to begin with the ace of hearts|pg||
nt|sharkey: have to pick up @C suit as well|pg||
nt|sybarra: another "all in" move imo |pg||
pc|c2|nt|sharkey: may be double dummy|pg||
nt|burry1975: yes first the 2 of clubs, then finesse clubs and then ace of hearts|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|burry1975: but like i said... you need to have a crystal bowl:-)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: agree now @S on the table and @D finesse|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|sharynr: how did Verhees know to bid 3NT?|pg||
nt|sharkey: may have been conventional as 2@S obviously showed @S stoppers|pg||
nt|sharynr: ah, spec points out 2@S= transfer.....good point|pg||
pc|c3|pc|h4|nt|sharkey: is he able to cash @HA - 9th trick?|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pg||
nt|xenya: 6N by S is hopeless though|pg||
nt|xenya: oh it's by N...|pg||
nt|sharynr: will he duck the @SJ now|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|sharkey: sry - disregard|pg||
nt|burry1975: the moment of truth coming up|pg||
pc|s4|nt|vugraphzbt: 5@h = 2|pg||
nt|xenya: still hopeless|pg||
nt|vugraphzbt: pass on 5@hx = undiscussed|pg||
pc|s5|nt|sybarra: wd |pg||
nt|rnmalik: with that lead they are playing to maintain it but lose a vul game|pg||
nt|sharkey: NS in 4@Hxx Bd 18 OR|pg||
nt|sharkey: shud|pg||
nt|sharynr: wow, that could be a big swing|pg||
nt|sharkey: big IMPs if it makes|pg||
nt|sharynr: if he picks up the hearts now, it wont matter if he ducks or not|pg||
nt|sharkey: to me the duck seem obvious but ....|pg||
nt|sharkey: think connection again...|pg||
nt|vugraphzbt: no :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzbt: this time Louk is thinking deeply...|pg||
nt|sharkey: thanks Natalia|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
pc|h7|nt|sharkey: E has shown M so has to play for stiff Honor|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  It looks like South expected North to have a balanced hand, or he would not have insisted on diamonds|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like NS have failed to handle this properly -- landing in a 7-0 fit instead of 5-3|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, Nigel, most likely |pg||
nt|nigel_k:  It isn't going to get better no matter how long he keeps staring at the cards|pg||
nt|xenya: even if @Cs came in, declarer wouldn't have 12 tricks unless there's something good in @Ds |pg||
pc|h5|nt|sharkey: ok - what now?|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|pg||
nt|sharkey: wd|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|d2|pg||
nt|xenya: now he knows there's no chance|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  is there a time monitor at the table?|pg||
nt|vugraphzbt: yes|pg||
nt|xenya: this might be a huge swing|pg||

nt|sybarra: lots of clubs make |pg||
nt|jeanhari: don't know the length|pg||
nt|sybarra: like 6?|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: 5@C would be defeated on @C lead|pg||

mb|p|nt|sharkey: think your point very valid Shirley|pg||
nt|sharkey: tend to interfer with "nothing" at favorable|pg||
nt|sharkey: try again...|pg||
nt|sybarra: and W just loving to bid  |pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: so far there is no exchange of imps|pg||
pc|cA|nt|nigel_k:  Was East's 2@h a transfer?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: cross ruff and it makes-@D A rightly placed|pg||
nt|xenya: yet another difficult hand for NS|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c8|pc|c2|pg||
nt|xenya: but N can pass -- well done|pg||

pc|c5|pc|c4|pg||

nt|rnmalik: Bas any discussion on the table|pg||
nt|xenya: 2 spades and 4 trumps|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|burry1975: he bid 7H! wow!|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: Loads|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: Too much to relay|pg||
nt|xenya: declarer was probably trying cater for trumps 4-1 -- asuming they are 3-2, there were simpler lines of play |pg||
mb|1N!|an|13-15|nt|burry1975: i'd open 4 spades|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  On board 21 they are playing 7@cx at the other table|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: 4@S for me|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C!|an|majors|nt|sybarra: XX= 3 @S  is my guess |pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: Bertens, meantime, is playing games on my iPhone :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: thought so:) poor S:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: NS discussing the way to properly bid S's hand|pg||
nt|sharynr: i know if i were down so many imps. I would try to be in game on that hand|pg||
nt|sharynr: looks like major takeout by west|pg||
nt|sharkey: agree Sharyn - with AK 7 times and pd open u shud be in game|pg||
mb|d!|nt|xenya: but not to worry as EW can easily make 1NT |pg||
mb|2S|nt|xenya: that's interesting|pg||
nt|rnmalik: interesting boards|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|xenya: very |pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: 4@S shud make; however there may be some choices to make|pg||
nt|burry1975: i'd say XX is points|pg||
mb|3H|nt|sybarra: that too |pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: If XX shows 3@S, then what's 2@S? Or is XX just stronger than 2@S?|pg||
nt|sybarra: I think it was points |pg||
nt|sybarra: didnt look at the E hand carefully sorry |pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: Bertens, after yawning: "Finally some thrill into the game"|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|burry1975: nice psych... 4s missed|pg||
nt|sharkey: good duck by Jansma|pg||
nt|sharynr: 1 too high i think|pg||
pc|c3|nt|nigel_k:  The perils of bidding grand slams - so often they don't even make a small slam at the other table|pg||
pc|c9|nt|xenya: 4@H is on of course as is 5@D -- probably|pg||
pc|cK|nt|nigel_k:  Should East or West have done more here?|pg||
nt|jeanhari: one too high but 3@C makes|pg||
nt|rnmalik: the same with 3@H makes|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|xenya: declarer can't possibly go wrong on a @H switch now |pg||
nt|xenya: the way the cards lie|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - NS can make 4@C|pg||
nt|sharynr: but east did well not to "hang" his partner any higher (even though he was a passed hand)|pg||
nt|sharkey: so no damage|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cQ|nt|burry1975: i think east might have done something more, but its not clear cut|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sharkey: ducking 1st @C left all options open|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|sharkey: On Bd 18 S played for the squeeze at the end in OR while the @C finesse was on so more IMPs to Onstein|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sT|nt|burry1975: i reckon he downgraded his king of hearts|pg||
nt|burry1975: so brink gained quite some imps on the last two boards|pg||
nt|burry1975: however as PO said...if EW would have bid 5D in the previous one...he would be the one laughed at. |pg||
nt|burry1975: but no guts no glory. As I stated before. He likes to be active|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I couldn't work out if 5@d makes on board 8 but it would be close|pg||
nt|burry1975: he tried to play poker once, but he didnt know what folding was:-)|pg||
nt|jeanhari: no cant draw trumps|pg||
pc|sK|nt|jeanhari: sorry i'm wrong|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s6|pc|s5|pc|sA|pg||
nt|jeanhari: if NS duck one round of spades they can arrange a ruff|pg||
nt|jeanhari: so declarer has to play spades first?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: now things are differenW should have played a @S from the table to make the hand|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|nt|nigel_k:  I think 4@s is a better contract but the lie of the heart suit means 3NT is safe unless East starts off by leading a heart|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|rnmalik: short ruff in @D|pg||
nt|jeanhari: signal will help declarer|pg||

nt|xenya: 21 imps on a hand is not an everyday result|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzbt: w asked s, however, about the meaning of this bid|pg||
pc|s2|nt|burry1975: ten tricks?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: E has an absolute balance hand |pg||
nt|xenya: interesting hand -- looks like good defence can beat it but very close|pg||
nt|rnmalik: He can ruff @C high as the 3@S in his hand are meaningful|pg||
pc|s7|nt|Vugraphzbt: Looks like it, spiked finesses onside|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|rnmalik: bridge made easy:)|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|sharkey: may play double finesse in @C |pg||
nt|burry1975: well done! lead duplicated at other table. Seems tempting to lead a diamond|pg||
nt|sharkey: I think @S lead stands out view bidding - pd obviously very limited|pg||
nt|burry1975: seven of diamonds can become the setting trick:-)|pg||
nt|sharkey: think W has to play @D to 9 - then @HKQ after N returns @S|pg||
nt|sharkey: IF N ruffs - think it may make|pg||
nt|burry1975: if north ruffs and plays a trump i think its down|pg||
nt|burry1975: declarer can play diamond to nine, and ruff a diamond...but he wont get rid of the 6 of diamonds|pg||
pc|s5|nt|xenya: suppose declarer plays 3 rounds of @Ds|pg||

pc|sK|pg||
pc|c3|nt|xenya: or this|pg||

mb|p|nt|sharynr: good stop|pg||

pc|d6|nt|sharkey: apparently 2@D shows @S as 2nd suit or 1435|pg||

nt|sharynr: interesting name for system :)|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|sharkey: Assuem E has "upgraded" his hand to 12-14 NT when he opened 1@C?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sharkey: Sry - misread the bidding|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|Vugraphzbt: 4@C is still a partscore :)|pg||
nt|sharynr: i am told tarzan comes from wijs muller=weismuller= tarzan (logical huh?)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sharkey: 1 NT forcing I assume - 4@D confirms huge @H fit|pg||
nt|burry1975: in open room ew didnt find their heart find as west judged his hand to be singlesuited clubs |pg||
nt|sharkey: E had no extras....|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Good morning to Henry Bethe|pg||
nt|henryb: Good morning Roland|pg||
nt|xenya: they miss a trump Q in either major|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|pg||
nt|sharkey: of course :) for those who remember him...|pg||
pc|d3|nt|xenya: hello Henry|pg||
nt|sharynr: not sure this one will be making|pg||
pc|d6|nt|henryb: And watchers all|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dT|pg||
nt|burry1975: well bid this one. Shame brink drijver are scheduled to sit out the second segment|pg||
nt|xenya: if you are going to bid a grand here, 7@S is better in theory|pg||
nt|xenya: but 7@H is way better on this specific hand|pg||
pc|d8|nt|sharkey: 4@D cud be cue as well but think it cud be interpreted both ways as hand limited I think|pg||
nt|rnmalik: +1|pg||
nt|jeanhari: nice bidding|pg||
nt|rnmalik: no 4@C|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Hi Henry|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|henryb: an unusual and successful play|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 7 should not be bid-finesse is involved in both the suits|pg||
pc|d5|nt|vugraphzbt: Drijver explains bidding to van Prooijen|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|burry1975: ten of hearts doesnt indicate a club entry so brink thinking whether he can trust this. However even with spades breaking only 8 tricks so he needs to play clubs|pg||
nt|rnmalik: we know that it makes because of stiff Q@H|pg||
nt|xenya: with all due respect, 7@H is against the odds|pg||
nt|sharkey: shud be off 1|pg||
nt|sharynr: had MUller chosen to double 3@D, perhaps they would have arrived in 4@H, perhaps not|pg||
nt|sharkey: 8 trumps usually play better than 7|pg||
nt|sharynr: but the opps did in fact make it quite difficult to be sure that it would be an 8 card fit|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - W's 1 NT obviously showed the minors and East's 3@D made it difficult for NS so a lot of credit to EW here|pg||
nt|sharynr: are we in an internet lul|pg||
nt|sharynr: lull|pg||
nt|sharkey: Bd 21 EW playing 2@C RD OR|pg||
nt|sharkey: Are you with us Natalia?|pg||
nt|vugraphzbt: yes|pg||
nt|sharkey: Muller in the tank?|pg||
nt|vugraphzbt: Muller has been thinking for a couple of minutes now...|pg||
nt|sharynr: thinking how he can shorten his trumps perhaps|pg||
nt|sharkey: seems like a lot longer|pg||
nt|sharkey: entries to dymmy are SCARCE|pg||
pc|s2|nt|imp_jan: hier komt nog een 4@H overheen|pg||
nt|imp_jan: oops|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sharkey: EW shut out in OR|pg||
nt|sharkey: the @H suit|pg||
nt|burry1975: so the white house strikes back with 45 unanswered Imps in the last five boards|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Maybe this set will never end|pg||
nt|burry1975: I think the white house likes that thought|pg||
nt|burry1975: this set can't last long enough:-)|pg||
nt|sharkey: good defence by NS - forcing with repeated @D leads|pg||
nt|burry1975: good effort but wont be good enough.. |pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: Classic NE trump holdings|pg||
nt|sharynr: and nothing to ruff :(|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s5|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: Brink's X of 5@C gained 9 IMPs; OR played 5@D-2|pg||
pc|s4|nt|nigel_k:  Yes, he can't make if West has @cA anyway|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sA|pc|s8|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Running the nine of clubs would be ideal but the entries aren't there to do it safely|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h2|pc|h3|nt|sharkey: Playing W for Qx as cannot pick up Qxxxx with E|pg||
nt|sharynr: he will be glad to find out that he was not making even with the finesse|pg||
nt|sharkey: probably assumed W wud have lead a stiff @H|pg||
nt|sharynr: reasonable play in the trumps suit nevertheless|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|burry1975: same defense. South trowing a heart and declarer playing jack of hearts. They copy the play |pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - lesson learned as 3-3 not likely|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h9|pc|h6|pc|hA|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|s7|pc|d2|pc|c5|pg||
pc|h5|nt|sharynr: now a heart or esle 2 down|pg||
nt|sharynr: else|pg||
mc|9|nt|sharynr: well read|pg||
pg||
qx|c27|st||md|1SA2HAQJ4DAK9854CK,SQJT76HT6D7CAQ632,S98HK752DQT63CJT4,SK543H983DJ2C9875|sv|o|nt|sharkey: but it worked|pg||
nt|burry1975: true, can't argue with success|pg||
nt|sharkey: Slam coming up|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|1S|nt|Walddk1: The 3rd set was scheduled to start 5 minutes ago|pg||
nt|sharynr: more interefence coming up|pg||
nt|sharkey: in @H though|pg||
mb|p!|mb|3S|nt|sybarra: will they get both hands in |pg||
mb|d|mb|4S|nt|vugraphzbt: dbl: s-->w not alerted, n-->e alerted|pg||
nt|sharynr: down 2 in 4@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sharkey: Maybe 4 NT and correct 5@C to 5@H?|pg||
nt|sharkey: tcorrect 5@C to 5@D|pg||
nt|sharynr: i like that way Carl|pg||
nt|sharkey: Then they'll end up in 5@D I think|pg||
nt|sharynr: but over 4NT north will bid diamonds, no?|pg||
mb|4N|an| |nt|burry1975: 4h can be set. In the open room verhees however could make it on a stripsqueeze|pg||
nt|sybarra: come back by the White House team impressiver here,  will be great next set! |pg||
nt|burry1975: however he misread the ending so still ended up down one|pg||
nt|sharkey: What is 1! opening?|pg||
nt|burry1975: for whose interested please check the playing records for this board and the three card ending|pg||
nt|sharkey: 1@D|pg||
nt|sybarra: remember they play a (tarzan) @C system |pg||
mb|p|nt|sharynr: then he might shoot it out|pg||
mb|5D|nt|rnmalik: Board 8 NS lost 11 imps|pg||
nt|jeanhari: good partscore , will it make?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzbt: Grace time is over now as well|pg||
nt|xenya: @H lead would beat 3N, but it's rightsided here -- as in the other room|pg||
nt|sharkey: 12 more IMPS to Onstein as 2@C xx made Bd 21|pg||
nt|sharkey: and 4@S bid bd 23|pg||
nt|sharkey: Did N's Pass over 1 NT show anything?|pg||
nt|vugraphzbt: yes, it was alerted...|pg||
nt|sharkey: Pass shows 6-8 0-4 @H|pg||
nt|sharkey: That the case Muller will raise and go down - my predictions so far not very good :(|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|burry1975: ew should be able to cash their spades at a certain point. so this should lead to down 1|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: 5 minutes of grace time just commenced|pg||
nt|sybarra: although I am surprised he didnt bid 1 @H |pg||
nt|vugraphzbt: if I heard it right, de Wijs's alerted pass was a penalty pass|pg||
pc|sK|mc|12|nt|sharkey: ty Shirley - so cud be down to 0?|pg||
nt|sybarra: Many thanks, to our excellent operator Bas....no clue if I will have time later to say  @H@H|pg||
nt|sharkey: May be shud have been 1@H opening and 2@D showing good raise?|pg||
nt|burry1975: bas, did bauke really open 1d?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: Yup, as far as I could see|pg||
nt|sybarra: Thanks also to my co commentators Carl and Frank.   We appreciate your time, insights and humor.   |pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: Thanks Shirley, it was my pleasure :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: We may have another bd  but who knows?|pg||
nt|burry1975: thanks all|pg||
nt|sharkey: are we already done?|pg||
nt|sharkey: thanks all|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: Nope, 28 too|pg||
nt|burry1975: well with bauke declaring this may take some more time|pg||
nt|sybarra: we may have another bd,  if they get to play it |pg||
nt|sharkey: we may have another ½ hour to go yet....|pg||
nt|sybarra: and we have another session today |pg||
nt|Walddk1: They don't take boards away in Europe. That's an ACBL thing|pg||
nt|Walddk1: They penalise them for violating time|pg||
nt|sybarra: that is better R |pg||
nt|sharkey: last board cud be a swing board too|pg||
nt|sybarra: you must be peaking |pg||
nt|sharkey: while you wait HedyG has been kind enuff to supply a link to their respective systems:|pg||
nt|burry1975: a spade looks tempting however if the ace of spades is onside declarer expects a club ruff|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: Actually Roland, apparently the players received an e-mail saying that no time penalties would be issued, but boards cancelled|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: Or so I was told by Sjoert Brink|pg||
nt|sharkey: http://www.ecatsbridge.org/documents/files/ConventionCards/2008MindSportGamesBeijing/Open/Netherlands/muller-dewijs.pdf|pg||
nt|Walddk1: I see, but that has not happened|pg||
nt|sharkey: system for Muller - de Wijs|pg||
nt|burry1975: and will only make then with hearts 3-2 and the 3 card heart suit ruffing|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: Indeed|pg||
nt|Walddk1: I now hear that this only applies if they can't play all boards due to weather conditions|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: Looking outside; more snow is piling up, with increased winds|pg||
nt|sharkey: we assume S opened 1@H|pg||
nt|burry1975: well in that case they can play segment 4, 5 and 6 aswell today|pg||
nt|sharkey: Has anyone checked if Muller's awake?|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Muller is just going through all 8,321 combinations|pg||
nt|sharkey: ty - Natalia|pg||

mb|d|mb|r!|nt|burry1975: a game for NS to end with, this shouldnt take that long|pg||

nt|sharynr: DBL not my style but seems to be the rage|pg||
mb|p!|nt|vugraphzbt: last board of this segment|pg||
nt|henryb: notice in the other room that South took a preference to partner's second suit|pg||
nt|xenya: yes|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|burry1975: 3nt by N?|pg||

nt|Vugraphzbt: Thanks all, we'll be back tomorrow @@ 4:30 AM NY time, 10:30 Paris AM time and 8:30 PM Sydney, I think|pg||
nt|vugraphzbt: we should restart at 13.00|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sybarra: oh oh |pg||
nt|burry1975: well, tarzan not build for this probably|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: Thanks Jean, my pleasure as always :)|pg||
nt|jeanhari: probably come to Utrecht tomorrow, see you there|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Thanks Jean and Bas|pg||
nt|xenya: thanks everyone -- it was an interesting set|pg||
nt|sharkey: Last board coming up and congratulations to the Onstein Team|pg||
mb|p|pc|s2|nt|nigel_k:  This is a pretty good slam in clubs - basically on one of two finesses|pg||
pc|s5|nt|henryb: that is he anticipated that North could have four hearts and five clubs|pg||
pc|sK|nt|burry1975: 2d is probably a relay after which 3S shows a splinter|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|jeanhari: oeps, Huub Bertens going for a score!|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: See you tomorrow then, if I get there tomorrow morning :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Scores are level now, thanks Jean and Bas-entertaining|pg||
nt|jeanhari: finding the cards lying well for his partner|pg||
pc|sT|nt|sybarra: aha  better!|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: Oops, sorry!|pg||
nt|burry1975: that looks more normal indeed|pg||

nt|burry1975: sorry simon for thinking you actually passed!|pg||
nt|sharkey: you keep us on our toes Bas :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 2 correct finesses:)|pg||
nt|jeanhari: I think all will be decided in the last set tomorrow|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|pc|s7|pg||
nt|burry1975: now three overtricks|pg||
nt|jeanhari: EW open getting the hearts wrong with the Bxx  opp. H9xxx|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|jeanhari: so 12 imps to Onstein|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I don't know if I would double 1@s with South but it looks better than the balancing double|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  And certainly worked out better|pg||
nt|henryb: I think North might have bid 2N over the balancin double, showing two places to play, but he certainly would have corrected 3@d to 3@h|pg||
nt|xenya: how did EW manage to stop in 2N on a combined 28 count?|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c5|nt|xenya: in the iother room|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|burry1975: pretty good i'd say but missed by drink drijver which is also not unreasonable|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: And another 11 on this board?|pg||
nt|jeanhari: declarer doesnt know but cant go wrong here|pg||
nt|jeanhari: indeed|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  I agree|pg||
nt|henryb: 3@c making 130 was a spectacular result in the other room|pg||
pc|d9|nt|burry1975: the Q?|pg||
pc|d7|nt|sharkey: shud try @C first|pg||
pc|dK|nt|burry1975: 11 imps back to the WH so it's tight match. The carry over is won back by 't onstein so it looks like a long exciting weekend in Utrecht|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|nt|xenya: in 1NT|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|pg||
nt|burry1975: the ten looked 100%|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: Thanks all, we'll continue tomorrow|pg||
nt|sharkey: The White House team were very close, and we have enjoyed some very exiting bridge these sessions|pg||
pc|s4|nt|burry1975: which is good considering we are stuck inside with the freezing cold outside:-)|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: Long for sure, already 15 minutes late...|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Some of us are enjoying summer though|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: :)|pg||
nt|henryb: This will drift off down 1|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s6|pc|s9|pg||
pc|c3|nt|rnmalik: the lead has also reduced to 25 imps|pg||
nt|vugraphzbt: we're supposed to restart at 15.15, see you then!|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|nt|burry1975: however they are also still playing in open room and it looks like a big swing is coming there aswell on board 12|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dT|pc|h3|pc|d5|pg||
pc|d8|nt|burry1975: sjoert and bas did that quite well on board 12|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Yes quite easy to end in 4@s on 12 and I'm not sure it is the wrong contract just on the N/S cards|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Anyway that's the last one for this set so thanks for watching everyone|pg||
nt|nigel_k:  Thanks fellow commentators and operator as well|pg||
nt|burry1975: segment two is scheduled to start in 10 minutes however i expect this will be postponed a bit|pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: (12 tricks made here, I misunderstood wat Brink said, as he said he'd finesse Paulissen for the @SK)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|sybarra: hmmm |pg||
nt|Vugraphzbt: Thanks all, we'll be back later, I hope|pg||
nt|burry1975: well....didnt expect that|pg||
