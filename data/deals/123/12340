mb|p|nt|davidstern: Pretty good 5@C contract depending on diamond finesse|pg||
nt|davidstern: And of course E/W make 4M|pg||
nt|barbyh: 2 cl has shut them out of the auction|pg||
nt|chick: anyone for overcalling with E hand?|pg||
nt|davidstern: I'm not sure I would have passed East at Nil Vul|pg||
nt|davidstern: Oh yes|pg||
mb|1D!|mb|d|nt|wilkinsona: Scotland in the OR made 1NT here|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|rodal f: Hard to defend 3NT S. Only a @C lead makes it down|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|davidstern: So good sacrifice as we have to assume that E or W may have come in if N/S rested much lower|pg||
nt|chick: or may have pushed them to 5M|pg||
nt|davidstern: I suspect that they would always have arrived in 5@C with or wothout E/W bidding|pg||
nt|phil_20686:  i assume this is a precision one diamond, there is quite a wide variance of style over what the north hand should bid after precision 1d-x-|pg||
pc|c5|nt|phil_20686:  you have any preferences for norths bidding here tony?|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|rodal f: A very good lead|pg||
nt|phil_20686:  this south hand is a normal precision 1h opener, and 2d looks to be a non forcing freebid|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: surprise alert of 2 diamonds..?|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|davidstern: I believe that this will be one level too high|pg||
nt|phil_20686:  It would be interesting to know norths agreements about the 3c bid|pg||
nt|phil_20686:  as opposed to 2n|pg||
nt|jackthelad: N just likes to bid|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|davidstern: East better make sure he doesnt get endplayed - unlikely of course|pg||
nt|davidstern: E/W probably feel a little sick at this point - could have passed out 4@H and now being forced to defend 4|pg||
nt|chick: do you think E is leading this K because he thinks his pard has the suit?   surely he can't want a ruff with that trump holding|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, it happens. I once protected against 1@D in the pass-out seat and ended up conceding 1370 in 6@C|pg||
nt|chick: so annoying |pg||
nt|barbyh: now thats bad luck|pg||
nt|davidstern: If he believes the @HA is with South he can split honours, win next heart get partner in and get his ruff so not THAT unusual|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sQ|pc|s7|pg||
nt|mdgraham: wan't too bad - oppo conceded 1540|pg||

pc|sA|pc|d2|pc|s4|nt|jackthelad: again spot on|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|davidstern: And there will be an endplay if that happened|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|phil_20686:  yeah, but there are 3 hand types here that affect the preferences, 6-4, 5-5 5-4, i suspect that most experts would use the 2nt bid to show whatever of these they deem most important, as a natural meaning seems superflous|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h2|pg||
nt|davidstern: Also with 7 spades thought it possible partner may have a singleton spade|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes|pg||
nt|barbyh: can actually make now|pg||
pc|sT|nt|rodal f: If E had time to take away @H he could drop one round @S and 8 on|pg||
pc|cT|pc|s2|pc|d3|pg||
nt|davidstern: I can't see how?|pg||
nt|chick: not so sure about that|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East needs to avoid leading a club - must give the ruff and discard|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d4|pc|dQ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|barbyh: swing the club q, take the heart finess and lead a club, gets aluff|pg||

nt|davidstern: I am guessing you are not drinking the 350 pound Bunnahabhain 1965 35 yo 53,9%|pg||
nt|davidstern: 5@C or 3NT here|pg||
mb|1D!|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: indeed not, £28.95 from Oddbins|pg||
nt|phil_20686:  looks like an aggressive preenpt got its come uppance here - perhaps they were feeling the pressure after letting through 4h|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|eamongall: our esteemed top rank commentator ran into a brick wall for his premet at the other table |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: 1 diamond from north... seems strange anyone know?|pg||
mb|p|nt|eamongall: thats Greenwood = jtr|pg||
mb|2H!|mb|p|mb|2S!|nt|barbyh: prob end up in 3nt|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West can't rule out  6@C just yet|pg||
nt|vugraphzgh: She's changed her mind|pg||
nt|davidstern: Both sides know that they have a misfit and their siognletons are well covered so 3NT looks best|pg||
nt|rodal f: 2NT=4@S and max I belive|pg||
nt|eamongall: it is kind of strange but Blue Club plays Canape |pg||
mb|p|nt|barbyh: well when she blackwoods she'll find out|pg||
nt|davidstern: Right now it seems|pg||
nt|vugraphzgh: With her fingers crossed!|pg||
mb|3D!|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: probably RKCB for clubs|pg||
nt|davidstern: If it is RKCB what was the response?|pg||
nt|phil_20686:  yes, but isnt that canape so as to open the major with longer minors because they beleive majors are more important - or do i have that completely wrong?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mdgraham: so no idea what 5@C means....|pg||
nt|chick: 0 keycards|pg||
nt|barbyh: lol  zero|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so perhaps 4@H is rkcb but they respond as if the 4N :) |pg||
nt|eamongall: even the max won't bring them to bid 6@S |pg||
nt|rodal f: Nicely bidded|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: may play 3N .. but can it make..?|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidstern: Oops|pg||
nt|chick: oops|pg||
nt|barbyh: dbl oops|pg||
nt|davidstern: See your oops and raise it one|pg||
nt|chick: maybe not 0 :)|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: it seems so..|pg||
pc|c6|nt|barbyh: has to be|pg||
nt|davidstern: Hence the question what was 5@C in response|pg||
nt|chick: one or the other of them has it wrong|pg||
nt|davidstern: Could not be zero else W would not have bid six|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: so last laugh to JTR|pg||
nt|phil_20686:  looks quite cld with the majors lying so kindly 3 imps to NI|pg||
pc|c3|nt|mdgraham: reckon West thought two keys without the @cQ |pg||
pc|c8|nt|davidstern: Very brave of South to lead one of his two aces|pg||
nt|rodal f: And a nice lead 2:)|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h9|pg||
nt|davidstern: and then the other|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: and the rest..|pg||
nt|eamongall: Murchan fancies himself as a dummy player |pg||
nt|eamongall: so lets see his effort |pg||
nt|phil_20686:  the problem for the defence is that they cannot lead their partners suit enough times so declarer will never have a problem scoring (eventually) 3c 4h 1s 1d|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|nt|davidstern: I claim|pg||
nt|mdgraham: very sensible too.|pg||

pc|s4|nt|mdgraham: gifted|pg||
nt|chick: shush, commentators can't claim, only declarer or dummy, don't you know BBO style?   :)|pg||
nt|davidstern: Spec says: Surprising a partnership of 30 years plus standing has this misunderstanding|pg||
nt|eamongall: I wonder would I be able to avoid the @SK ...|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: we can see playing hearts works, But John concerned of the breaks|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|eamongall: I typed this before murchan played it |pg||
nt|phil_20686:  5-2 diamonds would give declarer a real problem as he would have to knock out easts exit card before west played a second diamond|pg||
nt|eamongall: people are telling me double dummy plays but please remember Murchan is an ordinary human and does not even see 4 hands let alone have a gib button |pg||
nt|wilkinsona: defence to keep declarer from his hand now|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|pc|dT|nt|phil_20686:  clearly anothying but a diamond gives declarer no problem, but a diamond must be ducked right?|pg||

mc|8|nt|phil_20686:  people are suggesting that a top club return by west wouldahve set the contract - but in fact deglarers pips leead inevitably to a singe suited squeeze - heart was the only chance for the defence from wests seat|pg||
nt|eamongall: from 1stPanda "if Q had held @h86 doubleton here, he would have to exit with the 8 to avoid being thrown back in to lead a black card|pg||

nt|rodal f: They have 5cm snow a spec told me and Irland stop:))) 100cm here. Came by 4 days and no problem.|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: sound pass from Spears and Greenwood|pg||
mb|p|nt|eamongall: murchan opens up with a poor looking hand |pg||

mb|4D!|nt|chick: I would :)|pg||
nt|davidstern: Nice word lapse I know a few others|pg||
nt|phil_20686:  but now he has given himseld a problem - especially if they beleive in shape suitable doubles|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: EW play fairly solid weak twos, and a multi for the weaker varieties (I think)|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Britain, Ireland, Denmark, Netherlands and Belgium, all lowlanders and not geared for winter|pg||
mb|4S|nt|Walddk5: It comes as a surprise every year|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|eamongall: but you won't slide in 100cm of snow ...you can just drive along happily |pg||
nt|phil_20686:  does this show 4 of the other major? that would be a neat gadget here|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: like the alert less|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidstern: 2@H likely 8-11 and 2@D the weak 3-7 type seems to be the trend today (must be I play it)|pg||

pc|h2|nt|rodal f: :)|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hA|nt|barbyh: 4 seems cold|pg||
nt|davidstern: I need to refer you to the BBO commentators guide - cold is a NOT permitted word - likely is better as players often make fools of us|pg||
nt|rodal f: If @H was 5 in W there would have been a squize for 12|pg||

pc|h6|pc|hK|nt|eamongall: Frank ...no squeezes allowed in the Camrose .... up to a couple of years ago they did not even use screens |pg||
nt|phil_20686:  the defence has to wait to take its diamond ruff or they will reveal the winning spade play|pg||
pc|h8|nt|mdgraham: I wonder if 3@C showed some values, and whether a Lebensohl-style 2N was available|pg||
nt|barbyh: you are very likely-----right|pg||

pc|c3|pg||
nt|eamongall: depends on the panel and how many phil stephens is on it |pg||
pc|s3|nt|chick: :)|pg||
