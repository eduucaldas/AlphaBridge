nt|vugraphzpx: welcome everyone :)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: rehi all! easy 6 @H to start with|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: Eliasson will get a nice surprise as his partner opens the bidding with 1@H :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: hmm 7 maybe?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: Good Morning everyone and welcome back to Linköping and the final rounds of the swedish premier league. We will follow the outcome of the match between BK Lyx and Örebridgen, both ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: fighting to stay in the top division|pg||
nt|varange: hello again|pg||
nt|col3435: hello Hugh, hi everyone|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Our operator is Staffan Hed|pg||
nt|chick: Hello Everyone :)|pg||
nt|kaapo: Or strong club?|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: Nope|pg||
mb|1S|nt|col3435: looks like a normal 3NT here then|pg||
nt|joemanjo: Hi all|pg||
mb|d|nt|mmmakela: rehi Staffan|pg||
nt|mmmakela: sry meant 7|pg||
mb|2H|an| |nt|vugraphzbf: 2 @S piki i m³odszy|pg||

nt|vugraphzbf: ale ju¿ ustalili jak graj¹ :)|pg||
nt|chick: should easily find 3N here|pg||
nt|kaapo: Swedes love strong or 2-way club|pg||
nt|col3435: some well-fitting cards here|pg||
mb|3H|nt|mmmakela: bridge is one of the few sports where playing home is not that great an advantage|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: Hi again, Staffan :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Commentators Cornelia Yoder and Bob McPhee|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and Kari Patana|pg||
nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|joemanjo: We are off finally, only a small delay  :)|pg||
mb|4H|nt|kaapo: Hejssan :)|pg||
nt|joemanjo: Hi Vladimir|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mmmakela: N has a rotten rdbl hand|pg||
nt|kaapo: Hejssan alla|pg||
nt|joemanjo: This looks like a West Bengal vs Delhi match. NS and EW respectively.|pg||
mb|p|nt|varange: welcome to the Swedish Premier League.|pg||
nt|joemanjo: Hi all|pg||
pc|sA|nt|kaapo: 1NT is about 17-19 here I suppose|pg||
nt|col3435: at least declarer has something to think about on this lead|pg||
nt|varange: NS played pretty slowly during the previous session|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sK|nt|kaapo: Straightforward bidding|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  Hello, Markku. Good evening to all|pg||
nt|kaapo: Did 3NT show clubs or @S shortness or something else?|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|varange: which meant that the OR caught up|pg||
nt|kaapo: 1NT = clubs or GF relay?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sfoxa:  Hello, Kari.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|mmmakela: 3433 and 9 with no intermeds|pg||
nt|mcphee: 3nt a nice spot|pg||
nt|xenya: good stop but still an awkward contract|pg||
pc|cT|nt|kaapo: Hi Cornelia, Markku and Staffan|pg||
nt|chick: hard to pass with 2 aces though|pg||
nt|chick: and a lively first round of bidding dies quite suddenly|pg||
nt|rnc: For Running Scores, time schedule etc during the tournament: http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_plugins/content/content.php?content.877|pg||
nt|kaapo: Hi|pg||
nt|mmmakela: only guess who might have all 3 trumps|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: short @S and not min|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|chick: now that E sees that he set up the spades, he has to start grabbing tricks before losers can be pitched|pg||
nt|kaapo: Clubs will easily bring enough tricks for EW and luckily South hasn't got too high a heart in order to get a chance to play twice through West|pg||
nt|chick: with no entries, N must try to get to partner's hand again for another @H through|pg||
nt|col3435: if East is showing his shape this could turn out well|pg||
nt|kaapo: Ten tricks on top and 2 diamond ruffs bring it to twelve. 4-0 clubs shouldn't do much harm|pg||
pc|s3|nt|joemanjo: Both sides play Standard with variations|pg||
pc|s7|nt|burypies: tajemnicza 8@d|pg||
nt|kaapo: Hopefully 4@H was alerted too :)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|kaapo: Or are they playing with screens?|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|mmmakela: needs C A right here for starters,now might even make this akward contract|pg||
pc|h6|nt|kaapo: North might have some slam ambitions, if there are no wasted @S values|pg||
nt|rnc: For Running Scores, time schedule etc during the tournament: http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_plugins/content/content.php?content.877|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: north has shown 1-4 in majors with 5+@D here|pg||
nt|kaapo: Tack, Staffan|pg||
nt|vugraphzck: missed play...c\will claim at the end|pg||
mc|10|nt|mcphee: all over now|pg||
nt|varange: Ralf Willquist will be able to fill us in on most of the play as he knows the players|pg||
nt|varange: and our operator at the venue, Steffan, will keep us updated|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a big mistake to reach 6@s here. -2 if they can find the @c ruff on NS|pg||

nt|vugraphzpx: i would say they are pretty good, noone knows how good he is in a speedy :) I can ask him though... :)|pg||
nt|chick: Hello Everyone|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: if south has 5 spades, the best way must be to play the 8 of clubs and let it go round to north|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: or even a small one|pg||
nt|col3435: yes that's nice|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: nice 4@H contract here|pg||
nt|kaapo: Rehi Cornelia|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  hello, Cornelia|pg||
nt|kaapo: 1NT looks interesting|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 1 nt seems needing swings|pg||
nt|kaapo: What does that show, then? :)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  if E decided to open 1nt, good ending could be 3nt |pg||
nt|kaapo: 10-13, might be off-shap?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  guess @d right - "only"|pg||
nt|joemanjo: What wd u open as North?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|nt|kaapo: Well, no need to interfere with his play :)|pg||
nt|frankaus: g'day all|pg||
nt|kaapo: North may get to open here, unless West finds 1@H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@C|pg||
nt|joemanjo: :)|pg||
mb|1H|nt|mcphee: need to reach 5@D |pg||
nt|chick: is he known as a particularly slow player?  :)|pg||
nt|xenya: the 3@D preempt in the other room was overdoing it|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|varange: hi Frank|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: I suppose Johan and PO at least play 2-way club|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: chick, sundelin is known as one of the slowest swedish players ever... :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: N won't sell|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: 2-way club, where 1@C shows either a strong hand or a weak notrump range, is often referred to as Swedish club|pg||
nt|joemanjo: 2@C and 2N take up valuable space to show a black two suiter.|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cK|nt|mmmakela: 14-16 Nt maybe?|pg||
nt|chick: certainly doesn't look like a hand that I would upgrade|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: 13-17NT from start, 2@D showed 13-15 without 4c major|pg||
nt|chick: :)|pg||
nt|mcphee: PO thinks his partners minor is @C:)|pg||
nt|chick: good thing I don't have a lot to do today then :)|pg||
pc|c5|nt|kaapo: I guess 1NT = 14-16|pg||
nt|kaapo: Some might bid some number of diamonds as West|pg||
nt|kaapo: Even if East doesn't lead a club, he'll get another chance|pg||
nt|kaapo: Unless he ducks a spade|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: this board is wrong duplicated. Not much, but the ace of heart is located at east, not at south|pg||
nt|kaapo: Makes a little more sense then|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  single?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: south stole the 9 of D from east|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: so east holds 3253 with A7 in hearts|pg||
nt|kaapo: Mikael and Cilla are in the minority for Swedish experts: they don't play strong/2-way club|pg||
nt|kaapo: Their system of choice is short club with transfers|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|frankaus: @D lead would have proved troublesome|pg||
nt|xenya: well if he decided to treat has hand as balanced, it makes sense|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hK|nt|xenya: whether it is balanced is doubtful though|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|pg||
nt|chick: almost any lead gives away a trick|pg||
pc|h2|nt|kaapo: Well, unless the other room plays the board similarly distorted, this has to be canceled|pg||
nt|mmmakela: so S has 10982 in dias?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: it´s the same at all other tables.|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: yes, south holds 10982 in @d|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|jkmjanusz: Witam!|pg||
nt|vugraphzbf: witamy nowych komentatorów |pg||
nt|abunio: witamy z Gdanska :)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: ns play 2-way club Staffan? Carrot?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: 2@C asking for majors, 2@D relay with lots of different hands, 2@H/2@S/2NT/3@C/3@D invitational|pg||
nt|chick: and N puts him to the test immediately, before he can get any other info|pg||
nt|kaapo: Of couse he does have @DQ and might get a trick with it|pg||
nt|chick: but N still has to find the @DQ|pg||
nt|mcphee: sure, nice bold play before anyones knows what is up|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6@C makes but it's not great. It takes more than the heart finesse|pg||
pc|h7|pc|d6|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|varange: choices choices|pg||
nt|xenya: all S's honours work and he knows it|pg||
pc|h9|nt|kaapo: @H8 looked discouraging|pg||
nt|chick: club switch still isn't clear though|pg||
pc|d4|nt|sfoxa:  so, we'll be unable to follow the play right - just enter result? |pg||
nt|kaapo: This seems to happen rarely but occasionally with the duplicating machines|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: we can follow the play as long as they wont play hearts... :)|pg||
nt|kaapo: In Beijing we had a normal bidding sequence and I ended up at 3NT|pg||
nt|mmmakela: we can until certain point but did S really pitch a dia|pg||
nt|kaapo: When I examined the dummy, I noticed our side had two diamond queens!|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: yes, south did pitch the 2 of @d|pg||
nt|mmmakela: very strange|pg||
nt|frankaus: still makes with 3@H 3@C 2@S + 1@D|pg||
nt|col3435: I guess you finish drawing trumps and try to cash some clubs, but when that doesn't work, what do you do?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Besides, if declarer is not careful, he may go down|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|chick: now should just lose the top trumps|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cT|nt|kaapo: It may get dangerous now, if he finesses trumps|pg||
nt|kaapo: Some also play Smith echo in the suit declarer first attacks (if count isn't relevant). If that's the case, @D2 might suggest finding another suit, too|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Must ruff one spade low and one high|pg||
nt|xenya: i think it's basically on a @H finesse -- barring something really bad in trumps or @Hs|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|mcphee: going to be a costly misguess sadly|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|col3435: ruff the club out and play for the @dA to be right?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|kaapo: Hmm, he attacked @S first :)|pg||
nt|varange: oops|pg||
pc|h4|nt|kaapo: On the other hand he seems to be home now if trumps are 3-2|pg||
nt|chick: one more round of trump, then set up clubs?|pg||
nt|col3435: of course you can get away with anything as the cards lie|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ralfwil: I had prefered to signal for a @d shift by playing @s10|pg||
nt|kaapo: Yes, black suits were a bit bad but anything else is right|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d7|nt|kaapo: Seems a reasonable plan|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mmmakela: and a heart maybe|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|chick: needed to take his pitches on the minor winners before another trump|pg||
mc|9|nt|Walddk2: Sorry, he can ruff two low|pg||

nt|kaapo: Here's an old convention card for NS. Could be that not much has changed: http://www.bridgeguys.com/pdf/CC/SylvanSundelin.pdf|pg||
nt|kaapo: But he had 1@S444 so he didn't really know what suit to pitch|pg||
nt|kaapo: Back in order here?|pg||
nt|col3435: oh, I wanted to see which diamond honour declarer would play!|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|col3435: a lot going on there, but I think declarer should foresee the result when pitching the heart|pg||

nt|kaapo: "We may combine discouragement and suit preference when known (or may be assumed) to be long in a suit; a high odd card shows preference for a high suit, a high even card for a low ...|pg||
nt|kaapo: suit - occurs rarely even if we should remember."|pg||

nt|mmmakela: no reason E shd bid 4 @S?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I also think 3@S is terrible|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|kaapo: I think 1@C is natural or balanced|pg||
nt|kaapo: And 1@H shows spades|pg||
nt|chick: which never works for me, but it seems to for everyone else :)|pg||
nt|frankaus: g'day all - |pg||
nt|varange: a clear violation of Burns' Law, Ralf?|pg||
nt|col3435: South must bid again here, but what?|pg||
nt|kaapo: EW might make 8 tricks in diamonds, so 5@D could be a reasonable save|pg||
nt|col3435: was difficult to do more though|pg||
nt|joemanjo: dbl worked |pg||
nt|xenya: agree -- double stands out|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Important for West to cover the @d 10|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Declarer needs one out of three suits 3-3 - but has to guess|pg||

nt|Walddk2: What does West have more than he already showed with 2@S?|pg||

nt|col3435: I don't see anything too bad in this auction, it just doesn't happen to get there|pg||
nt|varange: yep|pg||
nt|kaapo: Try to establish spades or cross-ruff or both?|pg||
nt|col3435: I guess you can just see what develops|pg||
pc|dT|nt|frankaus: i see i missed a grand :(|pg||
nt|mmmakela: @S K and then|pg||
nt|kaapo: They didn't, and neither did the open room|pg||
nt|frankaus: well not real garbagge and not short in @C so i would not  use it here|pg||
nt|varange: yep|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes! 1nt is good enough|pg||
nt|varange: Burns' Law: As declarer, one should strive to have more trumps than one's opponents|pg||
nt|varange: in some ways easier if playing the big 2NT, SAYC style|pg||
nt|xenya: if E is weak, he can take remove to 3@S -- the position is quite clear adter W's initial pass |pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|nt|burypies: ale Witek im namiesza³ |pg||
nt|kaapo: 3@D might be 17-19 NT with 4 spades - but just guessing|pg||
nt|mcphee: make 3N i think|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|c4|nt|chick: not sure I would have led a trump on that auction|pg||
pc|c6|nt|kaapo: Without the double, North would bid 1@D to show 0-7. Difficult to tell what 1@S shows here|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Yuval Yener|pg||
nt|kaapo: Loser on loser play on the next spade?|pg||
nt|yuval10: hi all|pg||
nt|kaapo: Hi Yuval|pg||
nt|col3435: yeah, why not @sJ and run it if West follows low|pg||
pc|s5|nt|chick: W might Q-ask |pg||
nt|kaapo: In case I was about right about the early bids, 3@H could be a re-tranafer and 3NT some kind of slam try follows by two cue bids|pg||
nt|kaapo: Fredin - Lindkvist had an even more straightforward sequence to 7@H|pg||
nt|col3435: but here west shows out, and if he allows the @h7 to score it's all over|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: west has the option of discarding 2 diamonds on the 3rd and 4th round of spade, denying the 6of H to score|pg||
nt|col3435: yep you're right|pg||

nt|vugraphzpx: Wrang explained the 4@D wrong it seems, 4@D showed game forcing without short D|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: with spade support of course|pg||
nt|kaapo: 2@D Multi, showing a weak two in either of the majors (or perhaps some strong hand)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Nothing wrong with this slam|pg||

nt|yuval10: 4@s looks like a fair-chance contract but both A@D offside and 4-1 trump will doom it|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: dbl or 2@C graham ?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, either could be right. 2@C has the advantage of bidding the good suit... |pg||
mb|d|nt|burypies: raz Witek siê pogubi³ na tej rozgrywce ale ogólnie naprawdê bardzo dobrze|pg||
nt|mmmakela: that was about today's snooker match|pg||

nt|mmmakela: will W balance?|pg||
nt|chick: I would|pg||
nt|arvid: I would|pg||
nt|kaapo: I guess I would too|pg||
nt|kaapo: Unapparently 4@C is asking to pick a major|pg||
nt|frankaus: pass  at 50s would be my action 2|pg||
nt|mmmakela: not the expected one|pg||
nt|kaapo: 10 down = 500|pg||
nt|frankaus: -10  = 500|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 4 H dbld cheaper|pg||
nt|frankaus: yes but hard to  be certain its not 800|pg||
nt|mmmakela: come on after 4 @C!|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, win @SA, then ruff a @H and eventually there is a squeeze against S|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: 2 @C for me anyday|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: The web site (mostly in Swedish) is here somewhere: http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_plugins/content/content.php?content.877|pg||
nt|kaapo: @S to queen, then run 7|pg||
mb|2H|nt|chick: would you?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: after the pause is a club lead ethical?|pg||
nt|mmmakela: yes|pg||
nt|mcphee: lots down|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: no double no trouble :)|pg||
nt|kaapo: But just 50 each|pg||
nt|col3435: ok, I guess even on three rounds of diamonds declarer would probably go down there.|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: 2@D was some kind of Multi: showing a weak two bid in either major (or possibly some strong hand)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: they will land in 2@h now instead of 2@s, if S had opened with 1@s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: South has all the important cards. @CQJ and @HKQ|pg||
mb|2N|nt|jkmjanusz: Po przepuszczeniu @H Damy Kasprzak zmieni³ wista na @S !!|pg||
nt|kaapo: Apparently 2@H was a simple reverse, a little light but with nice 3-card support for partner and great controls|pg||
nt|kaapo: Diamond split is very cruel, in case they end up at some number of dimonds|pg||
nt|kaapo: What is the 1NT range here, Staffan?|pg||
nt|frankaus: 2@H will make so no real harm|pg||
nt|varange: the one is as good as the other?|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: not necessarily a pause... remember the operator cannot enter bids until both people on one side of the screen have bid|pg||
nt|varange: friendly breaks either way|pg||
nt|yuval10: if he guess it that would be something :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but double shows the three-suiter and is possibly more flexible, and would therefore score 10/10 in a bidding competition|pg||
mb|3C|nt|kaapo: 14-16?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: not sure, 14-16 or 15-17|pg||
mb|p|nt|abunio: raz tez Misiak umozliwil piekna rozgrywke, ale na pewno niebyl to blad prosty|pg||
nt|mmmakela: if Lebens this promises values(3@C)|pg||
nt|mcphee: they blew n/s out of 3N|pg||
nt|mmmakela: still wd EW|pg||
nt|varange: you'd open the south hand 1@s Frank?|pg||
nt|varange: or 1NT?|pg||
nt|frankaus: many here include 5M332 in their NT range - klinger has  a great influence here a he recomends it|pg||
nt|xenya: but this is very double dummy|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @C is only 5-card - d is best|pg||
nt|hawe45:  D|pg||
mb|3N|nt|chick: that's one advantage of not bidding clubs, don't give away the bad distribution|pg||
nt|kaapo: Of course would be more cruel still, if South had them|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: they play lebensohl|pg||
nt|chick: if it promises clubs, that's ok with N|pg||
nt|mcphee: :)|pg||
nt|chick: but with a nice heart fit, it is trouble, double or not|pg||
mb|p|nt|arvid: If east had the jack of diamonds 6@D would have been a very good slam|pg||
nt|kaapo: Wrang saw short clubs with partner and opts for the 4-3 @S game|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: We had a lost connection at the other table which means board  15 isnt scored properly. The result in the open room was 6@S made, which should give another 14imps for Team Zang|pg||
nt|chick: he must win the @SA, so can ruff two clubs with the small trumps|pg||
nt|mmmakela: making 13|pg||
nt|yuval10: either way EW can make 10 tricks in @h because of the 87 doubleton @d so -1 in 4@s isn't so bad|pg||
nt|joemanjo: yes, missed the qj of clubs|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but with these suit discrepancies I would bid 2@C - always a good overcall of 1@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: so then very nice auction|pg||
nt|frankaus: will be nervous about the @D situation|pg||
nt|varange: the 8@h is a big card|pg||
mb|p|nt|varange: AQxxx isn't that flash anyway|pg||
nt|frankaus: yes  then i play garbage 2@C and puppet 3@C for all game going hands|pg||
nt|varange: ok|pg||
nt|varange: nice treatment|pg||
nt|col3435: can East just continue hearts here?|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: yes he can|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: well he has only 3 carder @S and a very weak 4 card @H suit|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: easy on a @D lead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East will do very well to lead a spade here|pg||
pc|c7|nt|mmmakela: well S never thinks with his 10-12.....|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: there are no screens |pg||
nt|mmmakela: against 2-way club most treat it as supposing the weak variation and W didn't bid after 1 @C so has clubs now if thinking one could assume|pg||
nt|mmmakela: even that was meant priv sry|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but, on the bidding, he may well do so - no, he has gone passive|pg||
pc|cA|nt|burypies: a przeciwnicy siê szarpi¹ |pg||
nt|kaapo: How do you like 2@D (either direct or in the pass out seat)?|pg||

nt|sunsamvar: and my money is on him to pull off this contract|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Play out of turn? We have heard that before. They can't keep doing that, surely|pg||
nt|sunsamvar: what a pity... great hand for timing in declarer play|pg||

nt|kaapo: Where will this end?|pg||
nt|joemanjo: I wonder where this will end. 3N or 5C? |pg||
nt|sunsamvar: multi 2@D|pg||
mb|d|nt|kaapo: 3NT seems an interesting choice - I was thinking about 2NT or 4NT|pg||
mb|2S|nt|chick: E was about to bid spades, so now will he try his diamonds, or will he hide in the bushes and ambush a spade contract?|pg||
nt|chick: 2N obviously for the minors, not what N wanted to hear|pg||
nt|chick: and S violates rule  1 of preempts .... don't bid again unless forced.   But with 6-6, I can see the temptation|pg||
nt|kaapo: In the end, PO went one down and lost 12 IMPs|pg||
nt|varange: and made 10 tricks|pg||

mb|3H|nt|joemanjo: 2 down without breathing hard and more if declarer discards wrong.|pg||

mb|p|nt|burypies: 1@s by³by w stylu Darlesu:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzbf: zasuwaj¹ tak, ¿ebym nie nad¹¿y³...|pg||
nt|kaapo: I might open 4NT if that shows both minors too|pg||
nt|chick: 2@C probably a precision-like bid showing 5-6 clubs and a 4 card major|pg||
nt|varange: one of our specs is having confit du canard - hmmmm, yummy|pg||
nt|ralfwil: perhaps best lead. declarer has to do all the work himself|pg||
nt|varange: yep|pg||
nt|varange: nice and neutral|pg||
nt|mdgraham: You have to bid 3@H, really.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mmmakela: Lebensohl is a very good gimmick that can be used in many various situations|pg||
nt|mmmakela: really like this?|pg||
nt|kaapo: 2 down on a @C ruff|pg||
nt|frankaus: 5@D X will be a poor compensation for NS|pg||
nt|col3435: ah, the danger of bidding grands|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: yes, the players at the other table knew about the 6-2 in @d and bid 7. Bridge isnt fair... :)|pg||
nt|varange: dontcha hate it when underbids get the imps?|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: It's a nearly perfect fit NS, and neither one knows about the other's singleton|pg||

pc|sK|nt|mcphee: nice stab for n/s, just no tricks|pg||

pc|d8|pc|dT|pc|dJ|nt|chick: that's a very good clue, by the way.... when a defender cashes the trump A and then switches, it's often a singleton, so you can figure you have a bad split|pg||

nt|chick: in competitive bidding, I think need to give as many options to partner as you can|pg||
nt|kaapo: 800 may have been very expensive, because EW's 4@S didn't seem easy at all|pg||
nt|kaapo: 1@C strong - 1@D weak|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: yes, but looking at the wrong hand as well... :)|pg||
nt|varange: says he, belatedly :)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  S could expect partner with relatively long @c and @h|pg||
pc|s2|nt|abunio: nie, do mojej mamy:)|pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: O, sorry...|pg||
nt|chick: if pard is not intereted, then can bid hearts|pg||
nt|frankaus: another friendly layout 4@D 2@C 1@H 2@S|pg||
nt|ralfwil: no! |pg||
nt|col3435: very much so :)|pg||
nt|col3435: nice though|pg||
nt|varange: yes|pg||
nt|xenya: double showed @Hs -- it would seem natural to bid your @S at that point|pg||
pc|s7|nt|chick: ok, but that's not lebensohl (for the benefit of kibs)|pg||
nt|kaapo: Yes, good to make the distinction clear|pg||
nt|mmmakela: not true Kaapo, most play leb here|pg||
nt|mcphee: this game may go down|pg||
nt|kaapo: As you see, D and S are adjacent on the keyboard. Easy to make "typos" if using keyboard input when operating :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: yeah, and all 13 cards are next to eachother so it´s easy to have a "clickos" for that :)|pg||
nt|mcphee: @C lead bad for the N hand|pg||
nt|kaapo: Well, you've been doing marvellously well :)|pg||
nt|varange: :) dang|pg||
nt|ralfwil: perhaps some kind of transfer|pg||
nt|varange: it seems that way|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: no alert on 1NT at least so I dont think they play it as transfer|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|mmmakela: N likes the lead but...|pg||
nt|col3435: good prediction - spade lead didn't look clear to me|pg||
pc|h3|nt|chick: as long as EW cash their minor winners, this cannot make|pg||
nt|kaapo: Some might use Lebensohl here. If it's in use, then South's 3@D shows some values; he'd bid 2NT with a very weak hand|pg||
nt|varange: wow|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mmmakela: I hate playing in 4-2 when 6-1 was available(ok extreme case but 4-3 is probable)|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h2|pg||
nt|abunio: mama ladna, nie ma sprawy, tylko zajeta:)|pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: Mike Gold twierdzi, ¿e w Polsce dodaje sie 3BA do od¿ywek dzieciecych...|pg||
nt|kaapo: @DJ would suffer the same, too|pg||
pc|hA|nt|chick: often opponents will compete, taking partner off the hook|pg||
nt|mmmakela: so 1-suiter for me|pg||
pc|h8|nt|chick: and even if 4-2, opps cannot double (else you run to hearts)|pg||
nt|varange: then the DBL must have some unknown meaning|pg||
nt|varange: how would S interpret the 3@d|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h7|pg||
nt|arvid: even if south is showing some values with 3@D I think his hand is too good|pg||
nt|col3435: yeah, and club is worse!|pg||
pc|s9|nt|chick: and to paraphrase your comment:   I hate playing in a 6-1 when 4-4 was available :)|pg||
nt|mmmakela: any opinions from kibs? majors or 1-suiter?|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  small club from table?|pg||
pc|sT|nt|kaapo: Most do, but many don't :)|pg||

nt|varange: theree's my answer|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|kaapo: @H10 isn't that great either|pg||
pc|h6|nt|kaapo: Nystöm could give a ruff but he would then lose his natural @C trick|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: yeah, but that would force south to ruff a club |pg||
nt|kaapo: Seems to end +1 either way|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: true|pg||
nt|xenya: friendly lead -- 10 tricks are available now|pg||
pc|hT|nt|mmmakela: name 1 besides you|pg||
nt|kaapo: My partner, I hope ;)|pg||
nt|yuval10: @c lead actually the best....with @s return from S....|pg||
pc|d3|nt|kaapo: And Garozzo, perhaps|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|abunio: 36 boards, 3 segments, 12 boards each|pg||
nt|mmmakela: and more to the point I think S shd bid 3 H instead of 4 @S in this sequence to show his hand|pg||
nt|mcphee: nice D from west|pg||

mb|p|nt|kaapo: Ah, I now remember Markku told that NS play 13-17 1NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: south will be a bit surprised when his partnern supports his spades :)|pg||
nt|kaapo: Still more IMPs for Lavec: Johan Sylvan didn't consider the West hand with queens and jacks worth a move on board 5. They played at 2@S|pg||

mb|p|nt|kaapo: Many would open the South hand nowadays. Surprising to see a strong clubber pass it|pg||
nt|frankaus: not many would pass|pg||
nt|col3435: I thought it was because he didn't feel the hand was good enough with a misfit, but evidently it was more because he wanted the penalty|pg||
mb|1N|nt|kaapo: 1@C was either balanced or natural|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: 2@D looks like natural, nonforcing call|pg||

nt|kaapo: Has West still something to think about?|pg||
nt|yuval10: then 8-1-3-1|pg||
pc|d7|nt|chick: its not impossible that S will switch to spades, hoping to remove the entry to diamonds|pg||

nt|kaapo: A great thank you for our marvellous operator, Staffan Hed, who had to wake up ridiculously early this morning to bring this show to us!|pg||
mb|p|nt|kaapo: I don't object to that but I think it would be fair to state that 1NT is usually not 14 in 3rd hand then|pg||
nt|mmmakela: last here, thx kibs,Kaapo, Chick and Staffan for outstanding operator job!|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: thank you, will try to keep myself from commentating though :)|pg||
nt|kaapo: 1@C 2+@C, natural or balanced|pg||
nt|yuval10: NS can find a good sacrifice in a major|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: not that early, about 7.50am.. :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: only -4|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  with a little bit more @c lay, 5@c could have been better than 7-trumps @s game|pg||
mb|1C|nt|mmmakela: hard to match the OR result here|pg||
nt|kaapo: 1@C 2-way|pg||
nt|kaapo: More tiring than actual playing, because you need to keep focused all the time|pg||

mb|1H|nt|kaapo: 2@D looks like natural and game forcing|pg||

mb|1S|nt|kaapo: 1@D either 11-13 NT or unbalanced with a 4-card major; does not promise dimonds|pg||

nt|kaapo: Would anyone try 3@C as North?|pg||
mb|3D|nt|kaapo: Hmm, have they incorporated transfers into the system?|pg||
nt|kaapo: 2@S might show something like 8-12 here|pg||
nt|vugraphzpx: 10-13|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: If he had a long minor instead of a major, it would be a psyche, but 1@H surely was not|pg||
nt|kaapo: That seems to be a raising trend in Sweden|pg||
