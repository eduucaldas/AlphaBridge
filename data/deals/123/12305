nt|marlowepi: i think you have too much to bid 2H, in both senses--likely to miss game, and unlikely that they will balance|pg||
nt|roswolf: agreed this is a potential england gain - John and michelle in the other room like bidding games even when they should not|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but if you DO bid 2H and get lucky, you have to redouble|pg||
nt|pef: the welsh n/s got to 3nt on the board where e/w played 3sx here.  3nt had essentially no play on a spade lead by east, but made anyway|pg||

nt|marlowepi: h Jx?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: did he catch u with Jx?|pg||
mb|p|nt|pef: oh, that's happened a couple  of times.  I mean with this holding|pg||
nt|roswolf: west will have a tough call once south opens|pg||
mb|1N|mb|2S|nt|pef: spades and a minor presumably|pg||
nt|mayors: yes M/m|pg||
nt|marlowepi: what he has is diamonds and a major|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|roswolf: bidding the 5 card suit as a 1 suiter|pg||
nt|mayors: 3@d transfer|pg||
mb|3S|mb|4H|mb|4S|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: double seems right|pg||
nt|roswolf: the 4@H bid put west under the cosh|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|pef: I think we need an english to american dictionary.  what's a cosh?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sap|pg||
nt|marlowepi: something u clout someone with|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mayors: has some control problems on the @h lead|pg||
nt|pef: for those keeping score, the earthquake I reported earlier was only a 3.8, nothing compared to the trembling in this match :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h7|pg||
nt|pef: would seem like a heart continuation was in order here|pg||
nt|pef: north knows west has only 5 spades|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|marlowepi: with regard to the situation facing E over 3D...there is much to be said for using the distinction between a bid of 3H vs. 3S as spade raises with differently located minor-suit ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: strength. for example: 3H = club strength, 3S = diamonds at least as good as clubs|pg||
nt|roswolf: interesting idea|pg||
nt|pef: good point.  people don't think enough about taking advantage of the extra bids that opponent's transfers give you|pg||
nt|pef: lot of people now playing transfer responses to 1c and the same ideas apply|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if EW have a spade game at all, it is a huge favorite to depend on fit. and if they don;t go to gamne, such distinctions can hugely aid the defense|pg||
nt|pef: a heart continuation would have led to a massacre here, still down several, I think|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think declarer can get out for-2|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|pc|cA|pc|c2|pg||
pc|d5|nt|pef: that seems about right if he guesses diamonds|pg||
nt|marlowepi: using such a methoid here, E would bid 3H and W would pass 4H and lead a club. maybe he should have passed anyway, especially if 2S guaranteed 5 spades|pg||
nt|pef: but if south ducks, it probably is down 3|pg||
nt|mayors: But all in a dubious cause since 4@h was off if they found their @c ruff|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dK|pc|dT|pg||
nt|pef: west wins and continues diamonds, south plays another spade, actually maybe down 4 even, let's see|pg||

pc|d4|pc|d6|pc|d2|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this does not look promising for W|pg||
nt|pef: does seem like 2 diamonds and 2 hearts even if spades are guessed|pg||
nt|pef: even if north continues a diamond he can give south a ruff|pg||
nt|marlowepi: double dummy W can do it if no D continuation i think|pg||
nt|mayors: double dummy he can ruff out the @c K if no diamond continuation but why would you|pg||
nt|pef: you mean by playing for kxx of clubs offside|pg||
nt|marlowepi: no|pg||
