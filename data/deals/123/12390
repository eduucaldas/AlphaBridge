nt|sybarra: right Bill |pg||
nt|vugrapha3: well what can i say... i just report what I SEE|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: brd 1 now|pg||

mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|sybarra: and the other table did not bid the grand either on bd 12 !!!!|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: i would bid 2@S with west here|pg||

mb|2C|mb|p|mb|5C|mb|p|nt|rodal f: Not at the first bid!! Now it's OK|pg||

nt|rodal f: Where did the power come from?:) 5@C|pg||
nt|athene: so he escapes with just one down|pg||

mc|10|nt|athene: it was fairly optimistic bidding here but when you have a huge trump fit it's hard for opps to double you even if they have quite a few points|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugrapha3: Women are straight semis 4 teams|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1H|mb|1S|nt|athene: 1@D 1@H 1@S; now south knows if he bids something like 4@H it's just going to get 4@S over it|pg||
mb|3H|nt|sybarra: actually suprised Lilley didnt bid |pg||
mb|4S|nt|sybarra: now he is into the auction   |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: no problems here for declarer, just losing one trick in each side-suit|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: if one of the Semis from Women is close I will VG 4th set of the women|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|athene: actually maybe not|pg||
pc|h8|nt|athene: suppose north goes @HK, small club?|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: now declarer might run it round to the nine|pg||
nt|athene: on the grounds that north is more likely to have @CK10x or @CQ10x rather than @CKQ|pg||
nt|athene: but there is an argument against that - with something like @CK108, north would shift to the @C10, as a surrounding play|pg||
nt|sybarra: certainly putting it to declarer |pg||
nt|rodal f: Will miss I belive|pg||
nt|athene: so against expert opposition, you *maybe* should rise the @CJ when they lead a small one|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: E in the tank|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cT|nt|athene: it's difficult because the lower spot cards (@C8, @C7) start to matter on the surrounding play|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|athene: ok, well done north|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c7|pc|cQ|nt|rodal f: Best odd use to be honor + 10 at N|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: fantastic defense by Zoly|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s4|pc|sA|pc|s5|pg||
nt|athene: of course the other argument is that with honour-ten-one in clubs, north might switch to the honour|pg||
nt|athene: e.g. @CK10x switches to the @CK, hoping you will play him for @CKQ|pg||

nt|vugrapha3: lol... are you around here to see !!!!!|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: close match|pg||
nt|athene: if north is going to open 1@C on board 1, south can open 1@C here - it's no worse a hand|pg||

nt|rodal f: The odds have gone a bit down after the 3@D but only one way to handle 4-1 in @H|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Soi must take a first round heart finesse to make it|pg||

nt|vugrapha3: wow...the star commentator is here...HELLO BILL|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Bill and Roland:)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: In all likelihood, he will see the 6-2 club layout.  Then North will be marked for 0472 shape|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: well... he is still thinking|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: he picked up the cards now...|pg||

nt|rodal f: Can get problems to find the 6-2 in @C if S play a @D|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|pc|hJ|pc|h5|pg||

nt|Walddk4: I would have done what Lilley did and you would all have laughed. That's life|pg||
nt|athene: surely when your partner is very weak it makes more sense to try to give him a ruff rather than get into his hand for a ruff yourself|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|nt|bjacobs: I think you are resulting|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodal f: Ain't fare from what u say Roland. S belive N have some better HPs. Foult is at N for the 4@H bid|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|nt|vugrapha3: 5x14|pg||
nt|athene: this sort of hand is a good example of why you shouldn't play that double is penalties just because you have bid notrumps|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: you often want to bid NT and then double for t/o later|pg||

nt|athene: i am surprised south didn't open the hand actually|pg||
nt|sybarra: xx might have shown 3 hts? |pg||
nt|bjacobs: That's why I said "possible" - it certainly depends on their agreements|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Not after an overcall, with support you support|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Personally, I like to play the redouble as showing precisely honour-doubleton in partner's suit|pg||
pc|c6|nt|sybarra: and that is another possible agreement |pg||
pc|c9|pc|cT|pc|cA|pg||
nt|bjacobs: As Roland said, with 3+ hearts you raise, so it's quite a good convention.  Can often help in the defence|pg||
nt|sybarra: frankly what a mess this hand is!|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bjacobs: But here, I understand what Lilley was thinking.  We wanted to show a good hand, and the lack of a spade stopper wasn't that much of a worry|pg||

nt|rodal f: A Roland hand:) 20 - 20|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: everybody laughing... but EW probably a bitter laugh|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: 7 was biddable and gin|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|1N|nt|athene: 2@S looks reasonable enough for west here|pg||
mb|2S|nt|vugrapha3: lol|pg||
nt|athene: now east might give a courtesy raise even if not pushed|pg||
nt|vugrapha3: let's see... the tray is behind the screen now... we do not know who is thinking :)|pg||
nt|rodal f: Belive 4@S can become a bit hard, but not fare away. 4@H is on |pg||

nt|athene: ok, just natural, like 2@S last time|pg||
pc|s6|nt|sybarra: interesting lay out in spades (4/333 around the table |pg||
nt|athene: many top pairs play some way to show both majors after 1minor (1NT)|pg||

nt|sybarra: another magic hand |pg||
nt|athene: west's raise was quite aggressive, given his partner was a passed hand|pg||
nt|rodal f: An other magic218 Syb?:) |pg||
nt|athene: maybe he just felt that 2@H was unlikely to buy it anyway even if it was the limit of the hand|pg||
