nt|rodal f: 6-9 and 5@H+ I belive|pg||
pc|c6|nt|hedyg: best defense would be @C lead and 10@d by S|pg||
nt|snetram: i am not agree with 2@H opening. Bad bridge - A,K and weak suit ( 5332)|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Maybe not any more|pg||
nt|hedyg: not if gets to disc a @d on @H and ruff a @D|pg||

mb|2N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|snetram: NS pay at least 500 in any contract|pg||
nt|athene: surprising to pass 2nt there with two aces and two potentially useful tens|pg||
pc|d3|nt|athene: after his 4@S last board|pg||
nt|hedyg: he already bid his hand when he bid 1NT|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d7|nt|athene: north dodged a bullet, doubling rather than overcalling 1nt - that might have led to a lot of trouble for NS|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1NT should show 8-10|pg||
nt|chick: both tens are in suits that W doesn't have, so they may not be worth much|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|chick: same with the length in @Ds|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c2|pc|c8|pg||
nt|rodal f: Norwegian specs will tell me if I'm wrong. Belive it's still 6 cup rounds before the final are to be played. At 3rd round the best teams play there first cup match. |pg||
nt|athene: i would say both tens are working quite hard|pg||
nt|chick: he has almost nothing to help set up tricks in W's suits|pg||
nt|athene: give partner nothing in diamonds and just the jack in spades for instance|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: awkward for west here - 4@S goes past 4@H|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|athene: the same issue as you have with opening - do you open the shorter suit to give yourself an easier rebid?|pg||
mb|5H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dJ|nt|chick: not for opening bids, but when forced to start at a higher level, like here, yes|pg||
nt|athene: very ugly to force yourself to 5@H|pg||

nt|chick: the trouble with something like neg double, or 4D for majors, is that partner will expect 4-4 type of hand and won't get excited with a 3 card major. with 6-5, I personally prefer ...|pg||
nt|chick: to bid the suits|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: if 4@d is for majors it is surely not 4-4, you would just bid X with that|pg||
