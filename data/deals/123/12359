nt|vugraphzgn: sorry|pg||
nt|athene: np :)|pg||
nt|athene: this is a common treatment - traditionally 1@C (11D) X showed exactly 44 majors but this is too specific a meaning for such a useful low-level call as double|pg||
nt|athene: 1@C (1@D) X|pg||

pc|hK|pc|h2|pc|d6|pc|h4|pg||
nt|athene: possibly a ruffing heart finesse to pitch a diamond, although i am not sure it's really gaining often enough|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h9|pc|d9|pc|hQ|pg||

nt|athene: maybe he led the @SQ to try to induce count signals from the defenders|pg||
pc|h8|pc|sA|pc|cT|pc|h3|pg||
nt|athene: but i don't think you can rely on opps signalling spade length here since you are really marked with exactly four spades|pg||

nt|hedyg: maybe they open 2@d very weak +|pg||
nt|rodal f: Hi Krzy and William + specs and Bruno(the vug operator)|pg||
nt|rodal f: And Hedy:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: hi|pg||
nt|vugraphzer: Multi 6-9 hp vul|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty Markus|pg||
nt|hedyg: so he was really super maximum|pg||
nt|athene: borderline 3nt here; might be reached|pg||
mb|p|nt|cliveo: I've never known John and Michelle play so quickly :)|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|sfoxa:  must admit the @h jack play - covering maximum chances to guess @h|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D!|nt|snetram: modern preemptive|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|Walddk2: Surprise, surprise, partner will bid clubs|pg||
nt|golfsquash: Hi all|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: Hi rory and specs hope the table is stable this time|pg||
nt|golfsquash: If e/w compete to 5@h, it will make on this auction!|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgk: sorry for this poor connection, still havent missed any play, W has called director|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgk: missed any play on this board*|pg||
nt|athene: 1nt will certainly get them there|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgj: sorry, making bidding up to catch up|pg||
nt|chick: I presume EW are playing a strong club system|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|hedyg: and what did you plan to bid...3@d|pg||
nt|snetram: its looks very strong|pg||
nt|hedyg: notice no lebensohl by E|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mdgraham: no problem, Stuart|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  1@c - 16+points, yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: club lead looks much more natural from east's hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzgj: test|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  re-hi, Julia )))|pg||
nt|chick: Our vugraph operator today is Ying Piper :)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|kdr_fm: lts of chances given by N/s for e/w to show the majors|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: good chance west might wack this as a 2 way shot ... 5M makes and 5@C is -1|pg||
nt|athene: using the @SAK @HA to get the long suit going|pg||
nt|athene: now declarer might be able to come to two spades, two hearts, two diamonds, three clubs|pg||
nt|mcarroll: This is what the Americns cal "garbage Stayman" - where with short @Cs Stayman bidder can pass any rebid and hope to improve the contract|pg||
pc|dA|nt|rodal f: EW are brothers wich have played many years together in 1st and 2nd div. so they will land|pg||
pc|d2|nt|hedyg: small @H lead beats it immediately|pg||

nt|mdgraham: more style points|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: after pass - pass - 1@C - 1@S, what will east do?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|an|a|mb|1S|mb|d|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|athene: 2@H was possible since he was a passed hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: will probably end in 3NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: err...|pg||
nt|athene: an interesting point of theory here with opener's rebid in these situations - does 2@D count as a reverse? the normal meaning is not, but it does catch people out sometimes|pg||
nt|vugraphzgn: not a reverse|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East does not seem to think so|pg||
nt|athene: if 2@D doesn't count as a reverse, surely west was worth 3@D?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|athene: i seem to remember Rees tends to bid a bit cautiously :)|pg||

nt|Vugraphzgk: S thought it was N, N meant it as shortage|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgk: natural*|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgj: Director giving table into trouble for talking through the screen|pg||
nt|ady: west may open a weak 2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and a good solid one it is too|pg||
nt|ady: north has no definate action|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Another Roland|pg||
nt|chick: that will be some more imps for NI|pg||
mb|p|nt|kdr_fm: 3@H N/s makes so 2@s is a good result in the open|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|athene: a pretty definite pass i think :)|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|1S|nt|mdgraham: NS play 2M as 8-11, with 2@D reserved for weaker (0-7!) hands|pg||
mb|d|nt|ady: likely to fail by 1 trick |pg||
nt|athene: double is just about vaguely possible from south|pg||
nt|rodal f: With the best spot NS|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  yes, NI comes closer|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgj: hi everyone|pg||
mb|2S|nt|kdr_fm: Having said that 3@h vul is alot of bidding on the N/S cards|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 1@H shows @Ss|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|mcarroll: 4@S is also a lot of bidding on the cards|pg||
nt|chick: this has potential for 3N --  as major suits lie, there is a stopper in each|pg||
mb|3H|nt|athene: the question here is whether declarer can build a diamond trick for a black-suit pitch|pg||
nt|ady: might  make on this lead  |pg||
nt|mcarroll: Dbl shows @Hs|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|nt|kdr_fm: right well .... this should be 5 imps or so to scotland|pg||
nt|athene: could put the @D8 in but playing low worked out ok anyway|pg||
nt|rodal f: And a good 2@S keept NS away|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rodal f: Normaly waisted @SK. Then 6@Hand 11HP at N in vul, but....|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  but  missed, unfortunately. any major lead brings 9th trick, yes|pg||
pc|sA|nt|chick: yes, hard for W to see 3N with a hand of that time|pg||
pc|s2|nt|hedyg: are you suggesting that N should pass?|pg||
pc|s7|nt|athene: i remember billy eisenberg's bridge tip was to play low in dummy even with nothing in hand - third hand won't know to take a deep finesse against dummy and it often lets you build ...|pg||
nt|athene: a trick from nothing|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|cliveo: a difficult hand for Holland to lead from|pg||
nt|rodal f: -1 and 2IMP gained by that bid I belive|pg||
nt|chick: now N must lead a @H or the @H trick goes away|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h2|pc|hA|nt|chick: and from his holding, would be inspired indeed|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Right|pg||
nt|chick: nice switch :)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  especially when N knows about @s fit - that makes switch easier|pg||
pc|h4|pc|d6|nt|chick: coming in at the 3 level is pretty brave|pg||
nt|snetram: never pass in XXI century!!!|pg||
nt|rodal f: He is 2 times pair champ so now:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: i would bid|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h3|pg||
nt|ady: diamond was unfortunately bad   as even if not attacking spades early if declarer plays diamonds then more likely to p lay the king|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dT|pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d7|nt|sfoxa:  lot of pair use in such situation Lavinthal mark, not count or attitude|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|pg||

nt|chick: but EW did well to stop in 4, the other table defense dropped a trick by underleading the @SA|pg||
nt|chick: just another example of why you never underlead A's against trump contracts|pg||
mb|1D!|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|golfsquash: 14-16NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|rodal f: Why not try to take W after the 2@S? 3NT will be down by that bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|kdr_fm: was 2c alerted stuart ?   keri ?  if stayman thats quite a position to take albeit abit unlucky ..|pg||
nt|golfsquash: good pass by north|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 2NT Lebensohl, compels 3@C and the 3NT shows @S stopper, adirect 3NT would deny a @S stop|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: should be 2 down on normal defence|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, maybe not :)|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|golfsquash: This is the kind of hand where declarer will scramble lots of tricks|pg||
pc|s7|nt|Walddk7: http://www.camrosebridge.com/  for a website with lots of useful information|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: 3nt looks a bit much|pg||
nt|ady: 3 imps to England|pg||
nt|cliveo: According to their convention card Hamiltons 1NT presumably shows 12-14 so quite a stretch by Ferguson|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|dT|nt|mcarroll: But Frank is right - a vanilla penalty double should gain|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dA|pc|d5|pg||
nt|ady: what did the 1NT rebid show?|pg||
nt|chick: A Bath Coup possible there|pg||
pc|hT|nt|athene: he must have thought 1nt was strong, surely|pg||
nt|mdgraham: presumably putting a lot of value on the @HK |pg||
nt|cliveo: their convention card says 1NT opener is 15-17|pg||
pc|hK|nt|rodal f: In OR NT came at Ns hand so here NS are taken by there 11-14     12-15NT|pg||
pc|h5|nt|rodal f: Still must admit: @HK make there contract:)|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ady: then west was maximum for rebid  and still down 2|pg||
nt|rodal f: W lost a entery to early|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s3|nt|kdr_fm: 6 tricks will be good going - 3 imps out and thankfully not doubled|pg||
nt|golfsquash: falling apart now :)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: C!J continuation rather than @S would have helped the scramble|pg||
nt|athene: maybe they are just taking offbeat actions in view of the match situation|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hA|nt|sfoxa:  so again 1 imp in play - W did well playing @h K - now E can cash 2 @s tricks|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h2|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sT|nt|rodal f: 2@SX-2 for 500|pg||

mb|p|mb|2D|nt|athene: this is the sort of hand where you might end up in a 5-2 major fit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 5card majors EW|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: because 5@D looks a long way off|pg||
mb|3C|an|a|nt|mdgraham: but only a short way down, if NS cash out|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|3D|nt|athene: rees quite welcomes the double - he has nothing to say, and he duly says it :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|athene: if no double he would have bid 3@S i guess|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not really sure there's all that much point in doubling 3@C - as it has gone, it gives West the opportunity to say nothing|pg||
mb|4S|nt|mdgraham: and pard will probably lead a club anyway|pg||
nt|athene: now they will play 4@S one down instead of 5@D one down|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cA|nt|athene: majors are always to be preferred over minors|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c8|pc|c7|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c9|pc|c3|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|mdgraham: getting to game on these types of hands is simply practical bridge|pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: yes, you would expect this to be a flat board|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if you have a system that can stop in 4@D, knowing it to be the right thing to do, you will beat the world |pg||
pc|s6|pc|cJ|pc|d3|pg||

mb|1H|nt|ady: easy game for n/s   |pg||
nt|athene: not a great 6@S here but it does make|pg||
nt|rodal f: Running resaults: http://www.camrosebridge.com/action.php Something wrong at the match Irland - England|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: marginal 6@S, nothing special |pg||
mb|1N!|nt|golfsquash: a chance here to recoup some Imps|pg||
nt|athene: if they don't lead @HA or a club you probably end up having to find the @HJ|pg||
nt|mdgraham: @HJ coming down in three rounds is handy|pg||
nt|athene: although there are various ways you can fiddle around|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and there is also a two-way finesse for it |pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  32-boards match is rarely won by 1 imp, but as the situation goes, each imp is in count|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|athene: maybe you ruff some hearts and/or clubs and then run trumps and hope for a squeeze if no big cards fell|pg||
nt|ady: unlikely to get beyond game|pg||
nt|athene: i seriously doubt they will play anywhere other than 4@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C!|nt|kdr_fm: yup scrambled lots a tricks there ... just dont agree with 2@C in teams .. maybe not vul its ok but 400 out ...|pg||
nt|athene: hmmm...2@C might get south interested|pg||
nt|cliveo: If they bid it I would expect them to make it|pg||
nt|chick: strange 1N, bypassing a 5 card spade suit|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|athene: the problem with doubling on hands like south's is when it goes double all pass and the penalty is insufficient|pg||
nt|chick: I assume these alerted bids are somehow revealing it|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  must be. |pg||
nt|chick: ahhh, some kibs tell me that 1N promises 5 spades|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H!|nt|kdr_fm: this works @Hk onside 620 in|pg||
nt|cliveo: What would you bid then?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: if you don't want to just bid 4@S on these hands, then play something funky like 4@C overcall is a "strong" 4major bid|pg||
nt|mdgraham: there is also the possibility that there may not be any penalty at all  |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  in the first half, EW were announced as long-term partnership  having plenty of agreement|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: I'm also told that 2@D may be three and 3@C is FSF|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: must be, because they are getting to the right contract :)|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ady: diamond lead and continuation means heart finesse of the 10 is necessary to make 12 tricks|pg||

nt|chick: better :)|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|golfsquash: no need for that senond heart|pg||
nt|golfsquash: second|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: @d7 would have been better suit ptrf for @h, but S sould figure out why N underled the @dk|pg||
nt|golfsquash: The bidding is also a clue|pg||
pc|d9|nt|athene: if you lead the @HK and west wins and switches there will be a double squeeze around hearts|pg||
nt|mcarroll: when the NT opener makes a free bid after a nonforcing bid from partner anything can happen - and here it has|pg||
nt|rodal f: What happend:) Luckely 4@H is one of so a small loose by the misunderstanding|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d5|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|chick: a club would have put W in real trouble ... ruff with A and lose a trump,  ruff in hand and lose control|pg||

nt|cliveo: I wonder what the difference was between 2 @S and 4 @S by Brunner|pg||
mb|1N|nt|athene: 4@S logically has to be very long spades and hence a really big hand not to have just bid them first time|pg||

mb|1N|nt|athene: maybe the double was explained to west as not being penalty and that's why he thought the club lead would be at least safe|pg||

nt|ady: 4@H   can be held to 10 tricks with a spade lead|pg||

mb|1C|an|a|mb|p|mb|1D|an|!H|nt|athene: that board does go to highlight one thing - when opps bid a contract freely you really need a surprise to double them|pg||
nt|athene: no-one forced NS to bid 4@S|pg||
nt|athene: and they did it having heard 1nt|pg||

mb|1H|an|a|mb|2H|an|4 card support|mb|p|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|athene: now south has effectively doubled hearts for takeout then bid spades|pg||

mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: i would have just bid 1@S over 1@D and then doubled hearts later i think|pg||

mc|10|nt|athene: he could have tried it right away, but not of course after ducking a spade - that loses a vital tempo and allows them to cash their club|pg||

mb|2N!|nt|athene: now we find out if Brunner ALWAYS needs a six-card suit for a vulnerable 2minor overcall|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  we can asses the playing environment seeing just hands and plays. players on-site are unders emotional pressure, so everything is possible|pg||
mb|3D|nt|sfoxa:  the most important, I suppose|pg||

pc|c9|pc|c3|nt|mdgraham: although bididng directly forces NS to move into possibly murky pass/correct sequences|pg||

mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  hello, Cornelia|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|chick: The 2@S response to a multi 2@D opening normally shows a preference for @Hs and willing to play at the 3 level.  If opener has a weak 2 in spades, just passes|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|mcarroll: This looks like a rapid 2 off|pg||
nt|rodal f: A ok try but N have the obvious lead of @CA|pg||
mb|p|nt|kdr_fm: hi all welcome back to the 2nd session.  Not sure about that score thought it was 37/20 ... ?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzgk: connection crashed, unable to connect in time|pg||
mb|4H|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sfoxa:  what a start!|pg||
nt|chick: W can ruff a diamond high before drawing trump, and this will make with only 3 black losers.|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c3|nt|sfoxa:  and what if defence starts with 3 club rounds?|pg||
pc|cK|nt|chick: spades would provide a ruff for the defense except no entry to S's hand after the A|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|chick: being forced to overruff a club is another danger, but with trumps 3-3, still should make|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  eh - doesn't matter even so. 3 tricks for NS if declarer ruffs @d high|pg||

mb|1D|an|!H|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3D|an|xfer|nt|athene: 4@H should lose the aces and a trump; declarer must have got his diamonds away on clubs in the other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 1@d=hearts|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 4@H=no, we're not going to stop in 3@H|pg||
mb|p|pc|s2|nt|athene: at some point north might have to cash his @DA to hold this to ten - not easy, especially with the club side-suit concealed|pg||
nt|athene: of course declarer has to steal one diamond trick first anyway|pg||
