nt|vugraphzjf: I think it is the levell playing field syndrome in force|pg||
nt|brolucius: Level card table.|pg||
nt|henryb:  It is not the confusion, David; it is the time required to read the defense which varies with the particular brand of Multi|pg||
nt|brolucius: Many of these players compete regularly in world and European championships and are well capable of dealing with a multi 2@D opening.|pg||
mb|1D|nt|vugraphzjf: Next up this table De Knijjf/Wrang v Bramley/Demirev|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzjf: strange pass by East here|pg||
nt|ritong: pairs arithmetics are different|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: This session is 9 rounds of 3 boards each - testing for us operators as we only get three hands at a time for security reasons|pg||
nt|ritong: he would certainly bid playing imps|pg||
nt|brolucius: Almost half the field (20 pairs) had to buy themselves for the minimum $12,500 in the auction.|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: He would certainly bid of the club suit was with north as well|pg||
nt|ritong: hmm correction this is crossed imps  sorry|pg||
nt|brolucius: South cannot really double. He must choose between 1@H and 2@C.|pg||
mb|2C|mb|d|nt|brolucius: Double for take-out, showing a good hand.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Not particularly attractive for East to pass when his clubs lie under the bidder and he has four-card support for partner's suit. |pg||
pc|c5|nt|brolucius: East may have passed because 2@D would be inverted and he did not fancy going to 3@D.|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: Ah good call David that is likely why|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cT|pc|c9|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: The club suit is a little pregnant now for South to return a high one|pg||
nt|brolucius: Zia-Garner bid 1@D - 3@D (weak) - 3NT.|pg||
nt|ritong: three no trumps look difficult to beat because of the @c 7|pg||
pc|s3|nt|vugraphzjf: Geir in thought here|pg||
nt|ritong: but rather played by east|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sK|pc|s7|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: Bonjou Henri|pg||
nt|brolucius: Few players would pass the East hand, though. It lets South in too easily to bid the majors.|pg||

mb|2H!|nt|brolucius: Worth a transfer break with FIVE-card support. |pg||
nt|brolucius: 1NT shows 12-15.|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: I have a small interest in Brogeland/Malinowski and Passell/Casen and I do mean small |pg||

mc|12|nt|brolucius: So, they break the transfer when they are minimum and have four-card support. The theory is that you want to shut out the opponents when you have a 5-4 fit. I ahve never liked that ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: method because both opponents have already passed once and you have a fair chance to buy it in two of the major when partner is weak. Particularly when your suit is spades rather ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: than hearts. |pg||

nt|ritong: ok|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H!|nt|brolucius: Possible that 1NT is a transfer to clubs, but I do not have their card.|pg||
nt|ritong: ask jane|pg||
nt|ritong: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: It was alerted on both sides of the table|pg||
nt|brolucius: 1@C shows at least 16 points.|pg||

pc|h3|pc|hJ|pc|hK|nt|brolucius: East puts in the @HJ because he can see that it will fall under the @HQ anyway on the next round.|pg||
nt|chessmaste: I would have said West must duck in tempo - but its too late|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|brolucius: He did. But it was a very slow tempo.|pg||
nt|ritong: ducking in tempo would mean he expected that @h play  i wouldn t|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Now declarer may place the @C Q with East|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: Helgemo has created the possibility for south to now finesee clubs the other way|pg||
nt|brolucius: Anyway, by finessing East for the card, he ensures that he can score five club tricks.|pg||

nt|chessmaste: In practical terms declarer would have had to do something odd to go down|pg||
mc|10|nt|brolucius: Do you never do anything odd? Remember your stories yesterday about your dish washer.|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Deny everything Baldrick |pg||
nt|brolucius: You said that the dish washer was easy to switch on, I recall.|pg||
