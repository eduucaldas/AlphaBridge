nt|petergill: so EW should reach 3NT, whether South bids or not|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: we are about to start again|pg||
nt|petergill: though 2@SX by South is possible if South is aggressive|pg||
nt|ritong: um|pg||
nt|marlowepi: P 1C 1S|pg||
nt|petergill: If West tries for slam in clubs, 5@c will score poorly|pg||
nt|ritong: experts all open east hand, but noone would sit for a double, imho|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C!|mb|1S|mb|d|nt|ahollan1: Martel-Woolsey play Weak NT, 2+@C w/transfers|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C!|nt|petergill: A @D lead troubles 3NT - @DJ looks impossible to find, except perhaps for Zia, who sometimes leads lone honours from Hxx|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|petergill: Chip Martel and Kit Woolsey - Grand National Teams winners as a pair - went cheaply for just $13,000.|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@S splinter, tries for slam without bypassing 3NT|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: that's because in GNT i think they paired up with their wives :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: shd be easy pass|pg||
nt|petergill: East has a good hand for 6@C if West has the red aces  |pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: but correctly tries 3NT|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ritong: he led a stranded honor|pg||
nt|petergill: @HK (then @DJ) or @DJ lead seems best - extremely double dummy!|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ritong: but not the @d jack|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|pg||
nt|petergill: but Boye Brogeland is even more like Zia than Zia is|pg||
nt|petergill: @HK then @DJ on Vugraph would be quite something!|pg||
nt|ritong: drumroll..|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W has a lot fo slow stuff. any good auctionm should subside at 3N|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dK|pc|dA|pc|dT|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: Malinowski asks for all cards to remain up|pg||
nt|petergill: Zia used to play like Zia but admits to being more conservative nowadays, and Boye is regarded by many of us as the most dynamic card player in the world.|pg||
nt|petergill: @DK from dummy was normal - the overcaller is more likely to have @DA|pg||
pc|d2|pc|s8|pc|dJ|pc|d4|pg||
nt|petergill: Had Boye overcalled a more revealing 2@S instead of 1@S, then low @D from dummy can be found|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dQ|pc|d9|pc|s9|pg||
nt|petergill: East hopes South has @HA|pg||
nt|ritong: he is SURE that south has the @h A|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c4|pc|c2|pc|c5|pg||
nt|petergill: as @HK lead often will have @HA with it, but not against Boye!|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c6|pc|c3|pc|s6|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|h8|pc|c8|pc|s3|pg||
pc|c7|pc|h5|pc|cA|pc|s5|pg||
pc|cT|pc|h9|pc|d6|pc|s2|pg||
pc|c9|nt|ritong: down 2|pg||
pc|s4|nt|petergill: Artur Malinowksi is a regular in the English National Team - came 2nd in the World Teams in Beijing in 2008|pg||
pc|hT|pc|sT|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h7|pc|hJ|pc|hA|pg||
pc|d8|pc|sQ|nt|ritong: surprise!|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s7|pg||
pc|d5|pc|sA|pc|sK|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|petergill: Boye Brogeland is a World Champion, won 2007 Bermuda Bowl in Shanghai for Norway|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i bet we see that defense in tomorrow's daily bulletin|pg||
pg||
qx|o14|st||md|4ST853HKDAKQ63C754,SAJ962HT986DTCQ92,S4HQ7543D975CKJT3,SKQ7HAJ2DJ842CA86|sv|o|nt|petergill: Great defence by NS|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|petergill: I once played in a team with Boye Brogeland - he is the coolest best teammate ever. |pg||
mb|1D|mb|1H!|nt|ahollan1: 1@C=2+@C  1@H=4+@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: slow alert by Martel|pg||
mb|d|mb|1N!|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1N=15-17|pg||
nt|petergill: Stylewise, Boye Brogeland somehow turns the cards he plays into poisoned darts which strike at the unwitting opponents, hand after hand.|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: without interference Kit would have responded 2@H showing 5@S 4@H non-invite|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: North is considering 3@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: talking by both pairs now with martel writing|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: is he writing about posoned darts?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is 1st pair i've seen that plays transfer over 1@C in context of Weak NT -- it has some interesting ramifications not seen when pair is playing Strong NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: Woolsey is laughing|pg||
pc|dA|nt|vugraphzjf: Good Luck by Woolsey|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d5|nt|petergill: North worked out that partner had 4 spades so that prospects on defence were quite good, shortening declarer's trumps to less than 4 spades perhaps|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|petergill: dummy's I mean|pg||
pc|d6|nt|marlowepi: plus N doesnt have anything|pg||
nt|petergill: Both Chip Martel and Kit Woolsey are leading bidding theorists, so anything they do must have a lot going for it. |pg||
pc|c2|pc|d9|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|pc|s2|pc|s4|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|petergill: webcam of West and North http://www.cavendishinvitational.com/webcam/2/table2.jpg|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s6|pc|h3|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s8|pc|s9|nt|petergill: = Kit and Artur|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|sJ|pc|d7|pc|d8|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hQ|nt|petergill: Here's a good interview with Chip Martel from 9 years ago, in case you get bored out there|pg||
pc|hA|pc|d3|pg||

mc|9|pg||
qx|o15|st||md|1SATHA63D976CA7653,SJ9852HQ982DJT3C9,SHKJ4DAKQ852CKQJ4,SKQ7643HT75D4CT82|sv|n|mb|1C!|nt|petergill: in retrospect, perhaps North might have tried 3@D, but it was hard to tell at the time|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: sycophancy|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sick o fancybidding|pg||
nt|ritong: marshall!|pg||
mb|1S!|nt|marlowepi: sorry, play on words as private|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ahollan1: looks like 1@C=2+ and 1@S=@D  [malinowski also plays versions of Polish with English partner]|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: Woolsey asking what 1 spade is|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: 1S|pg||
nt|petergill: My friends and I are about to try out a new game one of them invented, called Two Bid Bridge. Each player is allowed only two bids per hand, except for bids at the 6 or 7 level. |pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: No fancy bids in that game :)|pg||
mb|4S|mb|5S|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: curiously -- i don't think it matters, even if 1@C and 1@S are natural, i think Chip-Kit play all "cue bids" natural [i.e. no Michaels]|pg||
nt|petergill: Is 5@S Exclusion RKCB?|pg||
nt|petergill: South might wonder. I would wonder too. |pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: boye has hand up to reach for a bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: \|pg||
mb|5N|nt|petergill: Exclusion = show keycards excluding spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if Boye bids 6@D -- then yes, Exclusion    maybe   [how's that for waffling]|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: I agree|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so now maybe just some slam try and 5N=pick @C & @D|pg||
nt|petergill: If simply 5@S = a Grand Slam try, then 5NT = I have too much to bid 6@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: annoucement 2 minutes left in round|pg||
nt|petergill: NS is not a regular partnership |pg||
nt|ahollan1: the play will be faster than the auction :)|pg||
mb|6C|nt|petergill: then 2 minutes grace period after the 25 minutes per round is over|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Helgemo in 7N|pg||
mb|6D|nt|petergill: NS are guessing here, I think|pg||
nt|marlowepi: graceland period, elvis has just left the building|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: The play will take 2 seconds|pg||
nt|petergill: 6@D = hedging towards 7@C, droppable|pg||
nt|petergill: NS still guessing|pg||
nt|petergill: with a lot of IMPs at stake|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: folds cards and crosses arms by Malinowski|pg||
nt|petergill: Other table bid 7@C, then 7NT over the 7@S save|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this would be unknown territory for a lot of pairs who play transfer responses|pg||
mb|7D|mb|p|nt|ritong: ole|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: The lack of confidence in NS's bidding might save EW from saving in 7@S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the slam must be easy. so hen in doubt, go for the choice that m,aximizes the reward when it is right|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: but now woolsey is in the tank puts cards on table|pg||
nt|petergill: To save or not to save, that is the question|pg||
mb|7S|nt|marlowepi: example of why it is important to make all bids but the last in tempo|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|petergill: Great decisions all round, so far|pg||
nt|petergill: Will South go all the way?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: kit starts to take bids and boye says wait now he picks up cards|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: does Boye really know about the double fit?|pg||
pc|d6|nt|petergill: 7@SX - 6 would be 1400|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: two minutes grace to play hand|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ahollan1: great pickup for Woolsey-Martel|pg||
pc|s6|pc|d9|pc|dT|pg||
pc|s7|nt|petergill: 6@D by Sotuh was saying that he had too much to pass 6@S, but partner could pass 6@D on perhaps void, KQx, AKQxxx, Q10xx or the like|pg||
nt|petergill: I think|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sJ|nt|petergill: to pass 6@C, I mean|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|c9|nt|marlowepi: quite a decision by W, after an agonized choice by N who is in an unfamilair partnership|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c2|pc|c3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: just mathematics|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: loss the play|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: as directors are here|pg||
nt|petergill: With $853,000 in the prize pool, security is paramount in the Cavendish, so we see no scores from other tables during the session. |pg||
mc|7|nt|vugraphzjf: closing table back in second|pg||
