nt|royhughes: I will be curious to see if Weinstein bids here|pg||
mb|p|nt|royhughes: Many of the successful players bid a lot|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s2|pc|sQ|nt|royhughes: Weinstein had a flawed hand, no great strength, and letting the vul opps play 1NT is not so bad|pg||
nt|royhughes: Is this scored at IMPs?|pg||
nt|flash: yes, IMPed against all the other tables|pg||
nt|flash: max gain/loss capped at 17 IMPs x   of comparisons|pg||
nt|royhughes: Notice Levin's tiny spade spots -- there may be suit blockagte here|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|pg||
pc|s6|nt|royhughes: Not that it matters, since Fredin has 8 tricks after getting a spade|pg||
mc|8|nt|flash: has to shift to avoid overtrick?  shows 4-card length, so Levin will duck??|pg||
pg||

mb|1N|nt|flash: they're trying to give us a longer break   :)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|po-s: it is hard enough with IMPs|pg||
nt|flash: 15-17 NT (upgrades have been known to happen)|pg||
nt|royhughes: I wonder if Falleniushad a natural 2@d available -- probably not|pg||
pc|d7|nt|flash: no tricks, even double-dummy|pg||
nt|royhughes: No indeed.|pg||
nt|royhughes: EW have 8 tricks ready to go|pg||

nt|royhughes: The best Levin can do is knock out the club ace|pg||
nt|po-s: oops|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|d3|pc|dT|pg||
nt|royhughes: He chose to finesse spades instead|pg||
nt|flash: now down 3|pg||
pc|dK|pc|h5|pc|s9|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|d8|pc|s5|pc|s7|pc|h4|pg||
pc|d9|nt|flash: again, at this form of scoring, not the end of the world; but every over/undertrick does carry some weight|pg||
pc|c2|pc|s4|pc|sK|pg||
pc|d4|pc|c9|nt|royhughes: I'm reluctant to second-guess Levin, who is a great player|pg||
pc|c6|pc|sA|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h6|pc|hK|pc|h2|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|pc|h9|pc|h7|pg||
nt|royhughes: Looking at all hands, the spade finesse didn't look appealing -- it's just a 4th trick if it wins|pg||
mc|4|nt|flash: for those who joined us recently, the entry fee is $2800 per pair|pg||
pg||
qx|o18|st||md|4SKQ9HQ3DQT852CAK7,SJT7HT98652DK93C4,SA64HA4DAJ4CQJT98,S8532HKJ7D76C6532|sv|n|mb|p|nt|flash: and the entrants have to be willing to buy themselves at auction for $12,500 (if no one bids higher)|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|po-s: plus 12500 unless somebody else buys you|pg||
mb|2S!|mb|p|nt|flash: between the travel expenses and the cost of entering, coupled with a form of scoring not to everyone's taste, some players choose to bypass the event|pg||
nt|royhughes: Here is a dangerous deal |pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|royhughes: This is a good slam -- it only goes down if the defence can set up a heart at trick 1 and the diamond king is wrong|pg||
mb|5N|nt|flash: 2@S xfer to @Cs?  5NT pick a slam??|pg||
mb|p|nt|royhughes: One would think so.  Maybe 3@c was an acceptance in clubs, based on the good fit|pg||
nt|flash: 3@C probably says he likes @Cs|pg||
nt|royhughes: This is a complicated deal if you look just at the NS hands.  There is something to be said for being in 7, since you may go down in 6 with everything wrong|pg||
nt|royhughes: There was an interesting article in the last Bridge World about this kind of thing|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|royhughes: This deal is not strictly 5-or-7, since it requires a parlay to go down in 6|pg||
nt|flash: this was NOT grand-slam force...|pg||
pc|h5|nt|royhughes: No, I think it was pick-a-slam|pg||
nt|royhughes: I don't think the North hand is strong enough to demand 7 opposite the AK clubs|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hK|nt|po-s: well Roy, it can´t have been this kind of hand - this isn´t a 5 or 7hand|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|vugraphzje: claiming|pg||
mc|12|nt|po-s: first you need a heart start to possibly beat six|pg||
nt|royhughes: Right -- I just said it has elements of 5-or-7|pg||
nt|flash: this is the curse of IMP Pairs - you sit down and do nothing wrong and have a pair bid a slam against you...|pg||
nt|vugraphzje: Next rd same NS  vs   the Blanchards|pg||
nt|vugraphzje: will reopen in 30 seg|pg||
