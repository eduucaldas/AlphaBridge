mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Bathurst currently 2nd with 71 VP, Diamond in 4th with 62|pg||

nt|petergill: 3@D looks best, then 4@S 5@D perhaps|pg||

mb|r|nt|ahollan1: Helness overcalled 1@D with North hand|pg||

nt|petergill: west's @S9 will prevent South from double-finessing in trumps|pg||

mb|3C|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: :)  the bane of vugraph operator's world|pg||
nt|petergill: sorry, ignore me, I thought N had @SA|pg||
nt|marlowepi: all depends on agreeemnts, but on this deal it would be nice for 4D to propose a save |pg||
nt|petergill: in favour of 5@D - suitable vulnerability, |pg||
nt|petergill: against 5@D - @SKQ looks very good for defence |pg||
nt|marlowepi: George Mittelman suggests another possible agreement: X of 4S by the weak 2 bidder suggests interest in saving in Ds|pg||
nt|petergill: and Jeff Meckstroth's reputation for "always bidding 4@S, whether it's making or not" in order to coax a save out of East, makes the save in 5@D less clear|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Fallenius-Fredin bid this to 5@D|pg||

nt|ahollan1: consider it a hypothetical question|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or -- actual case in other room|pg||
nt|petergill: Aside from being arguably the world's best player, Jeff Meckstoth is famous for upping the ante quickly, making opponents guess, so when he bids 4@s you are less sure that he has ...|pg||
nt|petergill: his bid. One dividend from this approach is that opponents misguess a lot. |pg||

nt|petergill: so you need more tricks to beat 5@H |pg||
pc|c8|pc|s6|nt|ritong: mais c est juste instinctif|pg||
nt|ahollan1: I don't know Zagorin-Bathurst, but partnerships who allow choice of opening with 4@C & 4@D will often choose 1@D when @Sxx |pg||
nt|ahollan1: that way easy rebid if opponents bid @S and partner makes negative dbl|pg||
mc|12|nt|petergill: 6@S is not a bad contract. I'm not sure if 6@S, 6NT or 3NT is the best contract to be in, based on 26 cards|pg||
nt|petergill: or pehaps in 6@C one might play for the person with the 3rd trump to have 3+ @d's, by drawing 2 rounds of trumps then playing diamonds, ruffing the 4th @D if possible|pg||

nt|ahollan1: mentioning Verhees-Jansma reminds me of amazing feat in 2009 Spingold|pg||
nt|petergill: To read about the controversy about Italy's 2010 team, one goes to the BBO Forum at http://forums.bridgebase.com/index.php?showtopic=38622&st=15|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: et également ARD9 a gauche, mais dans les deux cas il aurait pris un pain|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Helgemo-Helness never sniffed at slam either|pg||
nt|warrens:  I'm told Bathurst is 31-32 and has won one Dutch national championship event.  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: Verhees-Jansma-van Proiijen [?sp] played in 3 different partnership combinations .. ALL playing a different convention card|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|ritong: ça ne va pas passionner poizat|pg||
nt|ritong: donc..:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: 3@c?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS transfers over 1@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S = ART FG Relay|pg||
nt|petergill: 31-32 HCP with no fit didn't appeal to these world-class players for slam, but often appeals to lesser players|pg||
nt|petergill: and you should give a suit pref lead on opening lead, as you will not have much chance for a suit pref signal if partner wins @HA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wow -- in other room the auction went   3@C-DBL-P-4@H//P-4@S-end|pg||
nt|petergill: that was a truly great lead by Zia|pg||
mb|1S|nt|warrens:  this team: Zagorin-Bathurst & Brink-Drijver finished 3rd in last year's Reisinger|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Brink-Drijver still young too|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: with Michel Bessis's hand, I would stay out of the auction - when vulnerable, I don't like to bid bad suits in bad hands|pg||
nt|ahollan1: especially hard to diagnose slam in 5-2 fit without bypassing 3N [board 4]|pg||
nt|po-s: and they will play for Netherlands in this year´s European Chships|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and yes, they won the event|pg||
nt|petergill: The controversy is that Fantoni - Nunes have been omitted from Italy's team, in order to put Bocchi - Madala in the team|pg||
mb|4D|nt|petergill: but this father-son partnership from France has done very well indeed since joining the Zimmerman squad, so perhaps his action has more appeal than i realise|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=Drury|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzxr: il ne pousse pas trop pour le moment|pg||
mb|4S|nt|vugraphzxr: 3@s contré est assez probable non?|pg||
nt|farfie: françois a noté que son partenaire n'a pas pu dire 1@s,|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: oui|pg||
nt|farfie: donc je doute qu'il soutienne|pg||
nt|ahollan1: tough position here for Zagorin -- wrong side NT, pass seems wimpy   maybe 3@S?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oops  forgot Bathurst PASSED hand|pg||
nt|po-s: next month - in Ostend, Belgium for potential kibitzers/tourists|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: prend, joue @d|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: et zigouille le valet de @c au final|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=ok hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@S=game try :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: lots of talking on both sides of screen explaining alerts|pg||
nt|petergill: and Meckstroth's 3@D bid took away just enough bidding space to puch EW overboard|pg||
nt|petergill: A boring 3NT to catch my breath|pg||
pc|c3|nt|farfie: j'ai tout faux:)|pg||
nt|jcmax: And 6@C would be no fun on a @D lead either. and realistically I would expect anyone to bid xxxx in @C with a 1S suit like that!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: results from Round 1 are online at http://www.cavendishinvitational.com/2010/TEAMS1-1S.htm|pg||
nt|davidstern: It may be dated but Brink Drijver's system card http://bridgefiles.net/pdf/2007-brink-driver.pdf|pg||
nt|jcmax: Declarer will most likely play for the @C A onside, ruff a @C in dummy, pitch a @D on a heart and hope for trumps 3-2. Easy game :)|pg||
nt|jcmax: That doesn't look like this year's teams to me yet, Al.|pg||
nt|davidstern: The VG matches are chosen live after the results are in so we are unable to tell you who will be next but it will usually involve the leading teams|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: Brink is pinching his nose and thinking hard|pg||
nt|ahollan1: there's a Bridge Base Forum that lists the open team makeup for the European Championship|pg||
nt|petergill: Almost all (or most?) experts open the very strong South hand 1@H, not 2@C, so that the hand can be bid accurately, without losing bidding space. |pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: sorry John I made a mistake|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think 4@D = Grant Baze covention -- showing BALANCED raise to 4@S|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cA|nt|ahollan1: you might be tempted if you know a weak spot in opponents relay methods - but pass then bid in game forcing auction is huge risk|pg||
nt|petergill: When the opponents had not yet disclosed their suits and were possibly heading slamwards using artificial methods, West rightly thought those conditions made intervention more ...|pg||
nt|petergill: attractive, to reduce the effectiveness of NS's auction |pg||
nt|petergill: and 2@H removes quite a bit of bidding space from NS|pg||
nt|petergill: I'm making quite a good case that Michel Bessis bids better than I do :)|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|marlowepi: breathe through gills|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ahollan1: would have been interesting to see if relay could sniff out possible 6@C|pg||
nt|petergill: 6@C fares better than 6@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: there should be newer version on ecats bridge -- from Sao Paulo 2009 Bermuda Bowl|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if people are interested, holler and i'll find the url|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|nt|ahollan1: even better if @C9 instead of @C8|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@h looks like a cue agreeing @d's|pg||
nt|petergill: Is there a case for leading @D10 and running it, in 6@D?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other than ....  it works?   :)|pg||

nt|vugraphzxr: oui|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: piganeau ne dort pas|pg||
nt|ritong: en tout cas, dumazet ne semble pas déterminé a tirer sur tout ce qui bouge|pg||
nt|warrens:  looks like S wants to get to his hand to play a trump to the 10|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|nt|petergill: after the overcall has advertised long hearts and thus short diamonds in West?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: I apologize in advance by Welland|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|petergill: good lead! |pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: Thank you by Welland|pg||
nt|jcmax: Declarer will probably try to ruff his @C loser before playing 3 rounds of trumps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm not sure why Team Brink not in running total -- or why 20 teams [i thought only 14 playing]|pg||
nt|davidstern: The results are wrong|pg||
nt|davidstern: They refer to a prior year|pg||
nt|davidstern: I am having it fixed|pg||
nt|jcmax: This way if E happens to have a doubleton @C and 3 trumps, he will still make|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: he is still looking at all the hearts down comes the screen|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that is great explanation :)|pg||
nt|jcmax: If he drew 2 rounds of trumps before trying to ruff the @C e would overruf and there would be no entry to dummy's @H-winner|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: up screen|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: down screen again|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i was trying to work out possibilities if win @H then duck @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: delaying choice of discard on 3rd @H|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: up again now hearts still all showing at the table|pg||
nt|ahollan1: since it seems all lines require @CA onside|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: all cards now turned over|pg||
nt|jcmax: It seems to me the only time you can make this contract with the @CA offside is when W has KQ doubleton in @D. But you also have to play for it, and who would do that?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for specs who haven't played using screens -- the screen is lowered so that only one defender asks/answers questions without risking unauthorized info to the other defender|pg||
nt|davidstern: The theory is better than the reality of course|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s9|nt|davidstern: One usually knows who is thinking and if there is some movement in terms of explanations on the other side|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i can't tell Sabine -- is that supporting my idea of duck @D at trick 2??|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sJ|nt|ritong: mais tout ça est académique  onze plis|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now that @H9 is good, doesn't look like West has any good options, but we know that defense can always generate 2nd trump trick|pg||
nt|petergill: To read why, you go to that thread, then follow the links from its 2nd page to the Neapolitan Club website, which has comments from many Italians on the situation.|pg||

nt|petergill: Repeating, http://forums.bridgebase.com/index.php?showtopic=38622&st=15 is the BBO Forums thread|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|vugraphzjd: strong but not gameforcing|pg||
nt|petergill: John Mohan is an American who won the World Senior Teams a couple of years ago|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: bien sage|pg||
nt|farfie: il aurait gagné en prenant l'entame tout de suite|pg||
nt|farfie: ah non|pg||
nt|petergill: The lead won a lot of imps for EW|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but does @D10 ever lose?  knowing that @DK must be onside|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: Brink shows 5 fingers to Wrang|pg||
nt|marlowepi: another boring 3N|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|ritong: non, mais pas grave|pg||
nt|farfie: 5 perdantes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H=4+@S|pg||
nt|petergill: yes, you might as well lead @D10, especially against weak players who might cover|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H=3-10 HCP, 5+@H|pg||
nt|jcmax: 2@H is probably the famous Muiderberg convention that is very popular in Holland|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: 4spades + Minor|pg||
nt|jcmax: Al knows better, he has a convention card .)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no mention in CC of 2@H being 2-suiter |pg||
nt|warrens:  once W had shown 6 @H's and 4@D's and hadn't led a stiff @C, he figured him for 3-6-4-0|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 3@C is some form of @S raise -- we just don't know the details :(|pg||
nt|warrens:  after all, leading a low @D from the Ace was a warning sign|pg||
nt|petergill: 2NT by who?|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: right -- the only issue in 6@D is whether to float @D10 or play @DQ anyway|pg||
nt|jcmax: N is now trying to find the right comfort level for the opponents|pg||

nt|marlowepi: "here i come to save the day"|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: how close is North hand to 2@D overcall?|pg||

nt|petergill: sorry website should say http://www.cavendishinvitational.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=39&Itemid=50|pg||
nt|petergill: I pressed the wrong button|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@H looks likely now, given that the misfit makes slam unlikely|pg||
nt|petergill: or perhaps he's thinking that 4@s will play better opposite 2-3 in majors?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Woolsey had much different problem    1@D-1@S//3@C-?    He chose and is playing 3N|pg||
mb|5S|nt|petergill: 6-2 fits with good trumps are less susceptible to 4-1 breaks (and thus usually better) than 5-3 fits are|pg||

pc|cA|nt|ahollan1: agree - no overcall here, but how close?  would change @Hx to @Dx be enough or need lots more opposite passed partner?|pg||
nt|warrens:  oh, a 6th @D makes it automatic.|pg||
nt|warrens:  after the ruff sluff in @D's, this will make because of the favorable @H position|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this set seems to be very declarer friendly|pg||
nt|po-s: of course North can drop HT to encourage declarer to run jack next|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: Thomas has his hands locked behind his head and staring at the dummy|pg||
nt|po-s: or nine rather|pg||
nt|warrens:  he's thinking about how to make with one spade loser and one heart loser|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 22  Zimmerman in North did not bid over 1@H opening -- later DBL convinced Multon to jump to 3@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: now one had covering his mouth|pg||
nt|ahollan1: where Bathurst struggled to make 2@S, Multon made 3@S after @H lead|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|petergill: the transfer response, just as Jacoby Transfers over 1NT do, also allows more space to bid sensibly|pg||
nt|petergill: Back on Bd 3 - it's hard to pass 4@H, because 4@D by East over 3@D would show both majors, not a strong hand with @H's - there are many hands where East bids 4@h and 6@h is cold. I ...|pg||
nt|petergill: blame NS for EW getting overboard, not blame E (just has a 4@H bid not a 3@H bid) nor W |pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: Zia that is he doesn't like it --- Demirev if "its small"|pg||
nt|marlowepi: board 3 of the spring fours?|pg||
nt|petergill: South finds a brilliant low heart switch and East misguesses|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i see it, but still wouldn't have included 5@S in my list of bids to consider|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's why i type instead of play|pg||
nt|petergill: on @H lead, can get rid of club loser and then set up H's (picking @H's), so there was no defence  |pg||
nt|petergill: Huub Bertens is a wonderful card play thinker|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ritong: je n ai aucun commentaire pertinent a proposer|pg||

nt|warrens:  another aggressive game that rates to make.|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: Dbl might show 4+ hearts|pg||
nt|petergill: At the other table, Woolsey's Dbl of a vulnerable Helgemo showed a lack of faith in Helgemo - still, Helgemo did buy a lucky dummy|pg||
nt|davidstern: Tough on South here|pg||
mb|5H|nt|ahollan1: thanks to spectator who provides Michael's quote "always play a nine on defense ... unless you have to"|pg||
nt|davidstern: Well done by Bertens|pg||
nt|petergill: Kit Woolsey's second Dbl might have been in part to avoid partner going on to 5@S on some layouts|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|warrens:  either W leads a black card, give declarer the contract, or he gets squeezed in the black suits in the endgame|pg||

nt|petergill: EW lead 3rd and 5th versus suits|pg||

pc|s5|pg||
nt|petergill: Much the same here - the Dbl was partly intended to stop partner going to 5@S. |pg||
nt|ahollan1: a truly vindictive Bridge God would have @H split 4-0 -- or @CA @C ruff|pg||
nt|petergill: The Wests are wrong when South has a 9 card suit, but right most of the rest of the time. And how likely is "two 9 card @h suits in one match"?|pg||

mb|3N|nt|davidstern: E/W dont have anything of interest|pg||

nt|petergill: Will Thomas bid 5@h or Pass?|pg||
nt|petergill: 5@H seems to be one level too high|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't think enough shape to pull - but it is close|pg||
nt|ahollan1: show of hands -- how many remember when North hand never thought of any bid but PASS|pg||
nt|warrens:  yes, I like S bidding, especially as a passed hand.  should be -1 in 5@D, assuming good defense |pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ahollan1: obviously that DBL was NOT Responsive, but some form of Rosenkranz [showing @C honor]|pg||

nt|farfie: oui,drole d'idée|pg||
nt|petergill: West would expect East to have a singleton spade|pg||
nt|petergill: on this bidding|pg||
nt|ahollan1: surely not enough shape for WELLAND to bid 5@H :)|pg||
nt|petergill: need to change to 5@H by West|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is 4th of 9 9-board matches split into 3 sets of 3 matches|pg||
nt|davidstern: 2-1-1-0|pg||
nt|davidstern: The last three matches do allow for replay of a match played today|pg||
nt|ahollan1: there can be playback of teams, but not within a given 3 match session|pg||
nt|petergill: 5 @C plus 2@S and 2 aces to knock out - you need to knock out South's ace first, but then can the defence plays @Hs?|pg||
nt|petergill: At the other table, East played @D10 from dummy and North rose @DA in case partner had @SAJ10xx and no @HA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wouldn't @SK be better shot than @SJ?|pg||
nt|petergill: That was clever of East to foresee that the defence might do that|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: screen down|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: now up|pg||
nt|petergill: @SK at Trick 1, then @SJ at Trick 2, would clarify the spade position for North|pg||
nt|petergill: but seems a bit double dummy to me. |pg||
nt|ahollan1: i suppose @SJ hoping that partner holds @SA and declarer @SQx(x)|pg||

nt|ahollan1: sorry David -- you got there first|pg||
nt|davidstern: It is my understanding which may be wrong that the playback can only happen tomorrow during sessions 7-9|pg||

nt|petergill: @D9|pg||

pc|cT|pg||
nt|petergill: Not clear which you should play|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well it is arguable. it means that when you know there is a complex problem on the hand you are excellent at spotting it and solving it. with no disrespect at all to Bart, who is ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: indeed a great player. it isnt a table-real context|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that could be David, i'm less than 100% confident about whether this set can have playback from session 1|pg||
nt|davidstern: My memory is aging and poor at best but I am pretty sure only tomorrow allows for playbacks|pg||
nt|davidstern: and only once|pg||
nt|petergill: club exit is normal, as South is expected to have @HA for the opening bid, and @HAK cannot run away|pg||
nt|marlowepi: bart gave me a zero at the table in Reno by seeing the problem without any probem being tipped. that impressed me|pg||
nt|petergill: @C4 exit makes it harder for South to count the hand out|pg||

nt|ahollan1: can they negotiate the @H ruff?   even looking at all 4 hands it takes a good eye to see the best defense|pg||
nt|petergill: EW have tried to transfer the declarer (of spades) to West, but have ended up wrongsiding the declarership of hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: Zia says don;t lead it my lead|pg||
nt|warrens:  makes 6@H by W but only 4 by E|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@S relay, so that 4@h on 4333 opposite 4333 can be avoided in favour of 3NT|pg||
nt|petergill: the relay also allows more accurate slam bidding|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe downgrade hand and 2@C was only path to Inivite  ---  or opportunity to see cool treatment of 2@S|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ahollan1: either way --singleton Ace and @Dxxxx makes it a iffy choice|pg||
nt|petergill: Meckstroth likes to play "reverse lead-directing doubles"|pg||

mb|2C|mb|d!|an|3 card support|nt|ritong: that was a super natural opening|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|flash: absent a 5-card suit, they open cheapest 4-card suit, unless specifically 4333|pg||
nt|flash: X is support (3-card @S support)|pg||
nt|ritong: thus helgemo showed like 18/19 balanced with @s tolerance|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: 1@h opening is only made if 4-4-3-2 and 5 card @s suits|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d6|nt|ritong: but helnass is not very hot about his hand|pg||
nt|ritong: helness* sorry|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: Unless Helgemo decides otherwise |pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: Woolsey asks if they play 5 card majors in principle|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: told no|pg||

nt|vugraphzxr: oui t es super bon en psycholigie important au bridge:)|pg||
nt|ritong: j aimerais pas etre a sa place|pg||
nt|ritong: encore une main de stayman|pg||
nt|ritong: musclée, cette fois|pg||
nt|ritong: leenhardt pourrait imposer la manche|pg||
nt|ahollan1: especially with trump entry to dummy [22 trump or singleton @S10]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: at least i don't think that they are a well established partnership|pg||
nt|petergill: Club shift more or less places West with @CK, so perhaps the "heart before @D" play could have been found|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C!|nt|davidstern: Only 8 tricks N/S in NT and 4@D for E/W|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 6 was 300 (2SX) to 200 (4@S -4) as we expected = 3 imps|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: Roy pulls out 2 spades bid and pputs back|pg||
nt|petergill: 2 and a half spades perhaps?|pg||
nt|davidstern: 2.275|pg||
nt|ahollan1: some pairs use 2N as spade raise -- that would work well here with in-between hand|pg||
nt|davidstern: IMHO|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: now bids 3 clubs and is writing to Thomas|pg||
nt|petergill: or 3@D? or Dbl? Not 3@s which is weak |pg||
nt|ahollan1: I sort of like 2@S  intending to bid 3@H given the opportunity|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe that brings DBL into Welland's options|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzxr: non c est sr il sait qu il est a moins l infini pas cool au moment d aller faire les points|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: meyer stretz c est leur deuxieme finale perdue|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 1D|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|ritong: en tout cas il y songe|pg||
nt|davidstern: Apparently 3@C is a transfer to 3@D|pg||
nt|davidstern: which is cue raise|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@C might show hearts and 2@H show clubs, if they are into switching responder's bids when two suits have been bid |pg||
nt|ahollan1: and none of us saw THAT coming :(|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: moren writing on both sides of the screen|pg||
nt|davidstern: Migry was suggesting it to me|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Diamond will open West hand on  8 1N [14-16]   I suspect he'll declare @H also|pg||
nt|petergill: The most recent thread about Jeff Meckstroth on BBO Forums (discussion group) is http://forums.bridgebase.com/index.php?showtopic=38901|pg||
mb|1H|nt|ahollan1: now P-P-3@C//P-3N ??|pg||
nt|marlowepi: advantage of not playing precision, u can open 1D here and have it be worthwhile|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|ahollan1: enter and sign in please|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or maybe DBL now|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ritong: ben, ils seront sans doute en situation de décider si ils sauvent une journée ou pas, c est triste pour eux|pg||
nt|davidstern: Welcome to Warren Spector|pg||
nt|warrens:  hi all.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i thought DBL was a reach -- hence my 1st guess|pg||
nt|warrens:  is 3@C forcing? |pg||
nt|petergill: We will see two more 9 board matches tonight after this one|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|davidstern: Defence needs to get clubs going|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@D - to get the good four card support in - is normal among experts - 3@D is for wimps|pg||
nt|davidstern: Before declarer gets heart going|pg||
nt|petergill: Zia has a near maximum for 1D :)|pg||
nt|petergill: I am kidding|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@d negative|pg||
nt|ahollan1: last board of the set -- 1 more 9-board match tonight then 3 tomorrow|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidstern: I will take my leave to get ready for the next match and try and fix the webcam issue. Thanks for your company|pg||
nt|warrens:  looks like 3NT is the easiest game.  5@D a bid tougher|pg||
nt|ahollan1: do panelists rebid 3@D or 2@D holding void in responder's suit?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: after all these hands -- we don't even know if 1@C is always strong or  2-way [ala Baltic Club] and one-round force|pg||
nt|petergill: in the webcam at the bottom of http://www.cavendishinvitational.com, |pg||
nt|petergill: Thomas Bessis is the young French guy to the left of the screen, and the silvery haired guy to the right of the screen is John Mohan|pg||
mb|3H|nt|farfie: logique|pg||
nt|ritong: voila qui est fait|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: do either of you know -- which Bessis is dad, which is son?|pg||
nt|petergill: Interesting lead|pg||
nt|davidstern: Michel Dad Thomas Son|pg||
nt|warrens:  certainly not everyone plays it so|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good / tough question Warren    what IS the default?|pg||
mb|3S|nt|vugraphzxr: tout ça est bien joué:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: egalité a 420  bien vu Q|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: plutot normal de jouer la manche et de la filer je pense|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: enfin bien joué de la déclarer et après on voit|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: patrice devrait mettre un petit du mort|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: pour garder une remontée au mort |pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: qu est ce que vous en pensez|pg||
nt|ritong: méjane aura un tit souci sur le @s suivant, si ce n est pas l as|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: oui|pg||
nt|warrens:  Ivote for 3@D.  Lots of playing strength.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: I think over 50% of top experts would open South's hand 1@d in 3rd seat at this vulnerability. I certainly would|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes it is not good enough for 5D so 1D it is|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not positive but next set usually 15-20 minutes after match ends|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ahollan1: wow -- everybody knew except me|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so the partnership needs to discuss East's 2nd actions of DBL, 2N and 3 new suit|pg||
nt|petergill: South is Huub Bertens from Netherlands|pg||
nt|ritong: bertens/bakkeren won the pairs event not so long ago|pg||
nt|petergill: It's not clear that this is a singleton - running the @d is possible|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|petergill: 1@D is good as a lead-directer, plenty of safety from the vulnerability, opposite a passed (North) hand EW are likely to have game on and 1@D makes it harder for EW to bid ...|pg||
nt|petergill: accurately|pg||
nt|marlowepi: excellent summary. plus if zia passed, there would be a UN enquiry|pg||
nt|petergill: Meckstroth never says "thanks you partner", even when he strikes a dummy as good as this one|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 7-5, 3 aces, supporting quacks -- too right, 2@D would be very timid|pg||
pc|hA|nt|petergill: No problem in finding the vital switch|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but absolute best response   "the older one is the dad"  :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: THAT lead could make things much easier|pg||
nt|po-s: how would yoy ever be able to catch back later otherwise?|pg||
pc|h7|nt|petergill: with North having a weak hand on the bidding, leading away from a king is possible|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: on  8  Diamond playing 6@H west -- gets @H lead    oh my|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think declarer was stil going to get @H right -- as an avoidance play to protect @CK|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ritong: mais piganeau ne crache pas sur la possibilité d un honneur sec en est|pg||
pc|h8|pc|c7|pc|h3|pg||
nt|warrens:  I still doubt he'll make it.|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|vugraphzxr: je ne comprends pas de rejouer @h|pg||
nt|ritong: il semble naturel de jouer @c maintenant|pg||
nt|marlowepi: world-class players don;t get a lot of experience decidig which unforced moysian fit to play|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|c8|nt|petergill: I think that the idea is that by saying "thank you partner" your tone might help the defenders estimate how happy you are with the contract, so they keep silent on all matters at ...|pg||
nt|petergill: the bridge table including that one|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ritong: et l affaire est pliée|pg||
nt|petergill: Thomas Bessis was one of the best juniors (Under 26) in the world until he turned 26 not that long ago|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can we rewind -- i want to see how auction goes if Welland tries 2@S|pg||
nt|petergill: Alex Smirnov at the other table is the same age as Thomas - mid to late 20's|pg||
nt|davidstern: 27 I think|pg||
nt|petergill: NS's ultra-bold bidding on Bd 7 gained 12 imps for their side|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Alex had great run in big Australian Team event this year -- he was old man with junior Aussies and New Zealand transplant teammates|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i dont know anyone who says thank you partner in live bridge|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sT|nt|petergill: Sorry, I stand corrected - Jeff has started regularly saying Thank You partner|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is our last board of the session   next group of 3 9-board matches scheduled to begin in 1 hour 20 minutes|pg||
nt|warrens:  I don't understand why S played the @S K at trick one|pg||
nt|warrens:  but nothing matters much on this hand|pg||
nt|petergill: still, that was the normal start to the play|pg||
pc|hT|nt|davidstern: I am a big fan of Thomas Bessis' game. i watched him do some amazing things in San Remo |pg||
nt|davidstern: And wrote about them in the Bulletins|pg||
nt|ahollan1: there's a reason this hand is still being played -- i just don't know what it is|pg||
nt|ahollan1: too right Warren -- @SK seems like never-play [i.e. it can never be right[|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: I mayhave missed the first play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thanks again to our vugraph operator Debbie|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: sorry sometimes they don't show the cards played|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well - if she got trick 1 wrong, then i take away my thanks :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd:  I owe you a penny then|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but that would explain why no early claim when @D split 5-0|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: anyhow all bye for now will restart at 4 pm PDT|pg||
pc|h9|pc|cT|nt|ahollan1: i was thinking @S finesse at trick one was best shot|pg||
nt|warrens:  ruff high and claim on 3-2 trumps?|pg||
nt|po-s: me too - don´t think he can - spade finesse would have made it|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Fallenius also in 6@D but De Wijs leads @D2|pg||
pc|h6|nt|marlowepi: the usual alutation is "is that all?"|pg||
nt|petergill: "Loser on loser" play to disrupt defence's communication if West had @CA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: assuming 2@S alerted because lebenohl situation -- 3@H seems a bit of a push  [spec asked about alert]|pg||
nt|petergill: @D2 at Trick 1 would have been natural count - that is how most French players signal|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|petergill: pitching a @d from dummy looks normal, but declarer doesn't know the spade position|pg||
nt|petergill: I think he is wondering whether to ruff with the ace|pg||
nt|petergill: Earlier: best was to cash @CA, then low heart for ruff with @SA, then @d ruff|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: Thomas and Huub are laughing at each other|pg||
pc|d4|nt|petergill: this is a fascinating hand to defend|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|dT|nt|petergill: When Jeff Meckstroth was my screenmate in the World Championship in Beijing in 2008, and a very pleasant screenmate too, Jeff didn't say Thank You partner in that event|pg||
pc|c3|nt|petergill: 4@S is a save against 4@D, with the bonus that 4@s might make on lesser defence against weaker players than these|pg||
pc|d9|nt|warrens:  I think E has to pitch now|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: he isnlooking at the jackof clubs|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good pitch -- now declarer taps himself|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for that reason, it seems that any black discard works|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dJ|nt|marlowepi: did he thank you at all?|pg||
pc|s9|nt|po-s: good def|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: Okayn will restart in about 10 minutes|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: maybe about 15 now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even better lead from De Wijs in other room|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|petergill: North and South are perhaps the two most famous players in the world - who hardly ever play together|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: Zia just said thank younguys|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ahollan1: in other room at beginning of match, Sabine Auken mentioned that although EW play for German Open team -- almost none of that team are true Germans :)|pg||
pc|s8|nt|petergill: I think if South bids 2@S, WEet still bids 4@D, North still bids 4@S, and so it makes no difference|pg||
nt|petergill: West I mean|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: Okay done here until next match|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that was the issue for me Peter -- would West still bid 4@D or would he settle for 3@D|pg||
nt|petergill: Thanks everyone, thanks to our Scottish operator|pg||
nt|davidstern: Page 13 on http://www.eurobridge.org/bulletin/09_1%20Sanremo/pdf/Bul_10.pdf if you would like to see some Bessis hands|pg||
nt|davidstern: Not Scottish Debbie Hyatt of USA not yet updated|pg||
nt|petergill: Thanks Debbie |pg||
nt|petergill: I'm off to bed - it's rather late here in Sydney. Bye everyone|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nite Peter|pg||
nt|ahollan1: we don't know which match will be featured on vugraph next round -- stay tuned|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: closing table now back in a few|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this first round was random draw - next paired by VPs|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: Matches being selected after the draw in about ten minutes time see you back then.|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: Back in 10 mins|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: hi we are about to start|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: we have a fun match here|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: both won there last match one by 20 and the other by 26  |pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: DeKnijff and Brink|pg||
