nt|vugraphzjf: David Stern Actually|pg||
pc|dK|nt|chessmaste: 1NT with a singleton - the latest fashion in Oslo|pg||
nt|brolucius: The defenders must establish a heart trick before a discard is set up on the @CK.|pg||
nt|flash: N-S play a very natural system:  Norwegian Std - 1NT is 14+ - 17; absent a 5-card suit, they open their cheapest 4-card suit except if specifically 4333|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d7|pc|dA|pg||
nt|flash: welcome to Mark Horton|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: Play club before spade?|pg||
nt|flash: and to David Stern|pg||
pc|c3|nt|brolucius: After the diamond lead, declarer can lead a club to set up his discard. |pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: Club win diamond and ruff high now|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: -1|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: If he plays a spade the defence will set up heart|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: Sorry -2|pg||
nt|flash: the web site for the tournament is  www.cavendishinvitational.com|pg||
nt|brolucius: North's 1NT may look a little strange but it was the most accurate bid available. A singleton @CA is worth more than a modest doubleton.|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: Where you will see a photo every 5 minutes from each table|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: Each VG table that is|pg||
nt|flash: the link to the results/standings is now working; also today's Daily Bulletin is posted and worth a read|pg||
pc|c7|nt|brolucius: If North does rise with the ace, South will have the chance to give a suit preference signal, since there will be no further tricks available in clubs for the defense.|pg||

pc|dJ|pc|d4|pc|d5|mc|9|nt|flash: these are 9-board matches, scored at IMPs and converted to VPs on a full 30-point scale|pg||

mb|1H|mb|2S|nt|brolucius: I believe that Helgemo-Helness were on the winning Vanderbilt team a few weeks ago, playing with two French pairs.|pg||
nt|flash: not a comfortable call for West|pg||
nt|flash: most play a jump over a pre-empt as strong, so 4@H would misdescribe his hand|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cT|nt|brolucius: I am told that they are playing in the same team today.|pg||

pc|c3|pc|c9|pc|h2|pc|c6|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s4|pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|brolucius: Bramley can discard one club (on a spade) and ruff two clubs, so no problem for him. |pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: Replays are allowed once only during this session i.e. you can play a team that you may have played yesterday|pg||
nt|flash: there's a gap between 'fine' and 'perfect,' particularly when one doesn't get to see all 4 hands  :)|pg||
nt|flash: (Bramley had no particular reason to expect South to hold a 7-card suit, although it was a possibility)|pg||
nt|brolucius: West's pre-emptive 4@H shut out North, who had a very respectable hand. N/S were playable in clubs. |pg||
nt|flash: the @S ruff would hold him to 10 tricks|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d2|pc|dA|pc|dK|pg||

nt|marlowepi: np|pg||
nt|jcmax: At the other table W bid 3@S instead of 2@S. now N couldn't show his @H and there never was any temptation to bid to the 5-level|pg||
nt|ahollan1: another potential preempt on this board|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|petergill: so this is 2nd versus 4th|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: strong|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but i thought it was going to be from Bathurst :)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ahollan1: 1@D=5+@D or 4441|pg||
nt|jcmax: Why is there no result entered for board 1?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: strong as in ACOL 2s??  wow|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ahollan1: Bathurst currently 2nd with 71 VP, Diamond in 4th with 62|pg||
nt|petergill: Sjoert Brink and Bas Drijver are in the 2010 Dutch National team. |pg||
nt|jcmax: I believe W would really like to splinter in 1C to make any higher level decision easier. But he may be afraid it promises a bit more.|pg||
mb|5C|nt|jcmax: so, not unlikely these two pairs will meet soon again at the table.|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@D looks best, then 4@S 5@D perhaps|pg||
mb|d|nt|ritong: donc, ne soyez pas stupéfaits si vous voyez EO faire des trucs un peu erratiques|pg||
nt|petergill: "6/5 come alive" is a saying that experts seem to live by|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: trying to fix resullts from board 1|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Helness overcalled 1@D with North hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: 4D would have a certain attraction if natural and suggesting a save|pg||
nt|petergill: west's @S9 will prevent South from double-finessing in trumps|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: leur idée sera de créer des écarts par tous les moyens légaux|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the other room Demirev-Bramley start same way on board 19, but Demirev bid 6N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room  1@H-(2@S)-4@H-end|pg||
nt|jcmax: And of course in their system 4@C may not be a splinter at all anyway.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: multi-taskers can spy on the other room using http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/ |pg||
pc|hA|nt|jcmax: No doubt N wishes he had had a bid to show both majors immediately over 1@D|pg||

nt|vugraphzjd: Zagorin keeps opening and closing his cards|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the problem with 3D is E cant know how strong W is|pg||
nt|petergill: The EW father -son pair also won a European Championship in Antalya, Turkey and a World Chmpionship in Shanghai in 2007, I think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=ART Game Force|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@C artificial GF|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: :)  the bane of vugraph operator's world|pg||
nt|petergill: sorry, ignore me, I thought N had @SA|pg||
nt|marlowepi: all depends on agreeemnts, but on this deal it would be nice for 4D to propose a save |pg||
nt|petergill: in favour of 5@D - suitable vulnerability, |pg||
nt|petergill: against 5@D - @SKQ looks very good for defence |pg||
nt|marlowepi: George Mittelman suggests another possible agreement: X of 4S by the weak 2 bidder suggests interest in saving in Ds|pg||
nt|petergill: and Jeff Meckstroth's reputation for "always bidding 4@S, whether it's making or not" in order to coax a save out of East, makes the save in 5@D less clear|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@D any minimum|pg||

nt|jcmax: The layout in the @S-suit could hardly be better for the declaring side, so even though 3NT looks more appealing 5@D should make as well|pg||
nt|ahollan1: same contract via very different routes|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|ritong: ce qui est d ailleurs un exercice de style en soi|pg||
nt|ahollan1: very disciplined auction from Bathurst|pg||

nt|marlowepi: ahoy Tez|pg||

nt|flash: N-S will have ascribed a meaning to the 3@C and 3@D calls here|pg||
nt|brolucius: A good six-carder, an outside ace and a singleton. You cannot make the same opening bid with that relatively strong hand and some duff 4-count with  a poor suit.|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: That was limit plus w spades|pg||
nt|flash: the default agreement is that 3@C shows @Hs and 3@D shows @Ss|pg||
mb|4D|nt|vugraphzjf: Bramley kindly shows me the explanation|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: demirev now receiving explanation from Helgie|pg||
nt|flash: going through 3@D shows a better hand than just bidding 3@S - that's now a 'competitive' call|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: 3@S from North would have suggested a hand that would normally raise to 2@S. Helness bids 3@D (one of West's suit) to show a stronger raise. Similarly 3@C would have a special ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: meaning. (The convention is known as Unusual over Unusual.)|pg||

nt|petergill: Al -a quick quiz question - in the WBF World Bridge Rankings, who's the top-rated American player outside the Nickell team?|pg||
nt|petergill: Exactly - Kevin Bathurst chooses to open at the one level - the modern style is that favourable vulnerability preempts in 1st seat are weaker than this South hand|pg||

nt|ahollan1: what would you bid with west hand over opening 3@C?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: too good for preempt at this color scheme with establishable suit & outside ace|pg||

nt|ahollan1: consider it a hypothetical question|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or -- actual case in other room|pg||

nt|petergill: his bid. One dividend from this approach is that opponents misguess a lot. |pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4S|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: Demirev asking Zia what 3 Diamonds is and Zia shrugs shoulder|pg||
nt|marlowepi: over 3C i would bid 4S al|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: what's the record?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and over 1C i wouls bid 1S|pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Kit Woolsey sitting west bid 1@C-1@S//2@C   color me confused|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: any guesses about 2@D?    a) only positive  b) 0-1 controls  c) other|pg||
nt|petergill: East is a passed hand, so West will not get too excited|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2 ways to play Unusual vs Unusual     the most common uses low q [3@C] to show low suit [@H] and hi q [@D] to show hi suit [@S]|pg||
nt|petergill: North needs just a bit more, e.g. @HJ or @CJ, for slam to be there|pg||

nt|vugraphzjd: long thinking by DeKnijff|pg||

nt|vugraphzjd: Bathurst asking about leads and carding|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 20, Demirev sitting East bid 2@D over reopening DBL -- Multon playing 2@S from South|pg||
nt|petergill: with South on lead, finding the club ruff is not easy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and Diamond does start with DBL -- so much for predictions|pg||
pc|sK|nt|marlowepi: i dont want to hear 5D|pg||

nt|jcmax: Anybody bidding these cards to slam should be very proud. Bridge is not always a just game :)|pg||
nt|petergill: South is on lead, hence no lead-driecting dbl|pg||
nt|marlowepi: diamond's partner not allowed to bid diamonds?|pg||
nt|petergill: Great lead, suit pref @C3 to say I have @DA as an entry|pg||
nt|petergill: the reason not to lead @DA, as most players would woodenly do, is|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ritong: ça n a pas été necessaire, les adversaires sont allés a trois tout seuls|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: Thnak you by DeKnijff|pg||
nt|petergill: so 3NT by West is the best spot, as 6@C is les than 50%|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: FOUND IT --- "1C-1S, 1red-1N,1S-2C are ART GF relays, any distribution"|pg||
nt|petergill: that dummy surely has a singleton @D in order to bid 4NT|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ritong: il va juste examiner le cas des @ss 4/1|pg||
nt|petergill: Our operator Debbie Hyatt is the only one of several replies to be right - answer = Pepsi|pg||
pc|d6|nt|vugraphzjd: e-w count signals is said all laughter maybe count?|pg||
nt|warrens:  2 @S's, 1@H, 2@D's & 1@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry -- Demirev WEST|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sJ|nt|ritong: mais c est un peu étrange de ne pas dire 3@d, deux bonnes cartes avec le part et neuf atouts connus|pg||
nt|ritong: vulnérable ou pas|pg||
nt|ritong: il me semble qu il etait tres legerement supérieur de jouer vers 108x|pg||
nt|ritong: a cause du 9 sec a gauche|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|d4|pg||
nt|petergill: so you need more tricks to beat 5@H |pg||
nt|jcmax: But the interesting problem really is whether the 31D bid creates a forcing pass auction or not when the opponents compete.|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ahollan1: when partner opens 1@S -- you can't tell which method is being used :)|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ritong: mais c est juste instinctif|pg||
nt|ahollan1: I don't know Zagorin-Bathurst, but partnerships who allow choice of opening with 4@C & 4@D will often choose 1@D when @Sxx |pg||
nt|ahollan1: that way easy rebid if opponents bid @S and partner makes negative dbl|pg||
pc|d2|nt|petergill: 6@S is not a bad contract. I'm not sure if 6@S, 6NT or 3NT is the best contract to be in, based on 26 cards|pg||
nt|petergill: or pehaps in 6@C one might play for the person with the 3rd trump to have 3+ @d's, by drawing 2 rounds of trumps then playing diamonds, ruffing the 4th @D if possible|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 1@S = ART FG Relay|pg||
nt|petergill: 31-32 HCP with no fit didn't appeal to these world-class players for slam, but often appeals to lesser players|pg||
nt|petergill: and you should give a suit pref lead on opening lead, as you will not have much chance for a suit pref signal if partner wins @HA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wow -- in other room the auction went   3@C-DBL-P-4@H//P-4@S-end|pg||
nt|petergill: that was a truly great lead by Zia|pg||
mb|1S|nt|warrens:  this team: Zagorin-Bathurst & Brink-Drijver finished 3rd in last year's Reisinger|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Brink-Drijver still young too|pg||
mb|d|nt|petergill: with Michel Bessis's hand, I would stay out of the auction - when vulnerable, I don't like to bid bad suits in bad hands|pg||
nt|ahollan1: especially hard to diagnose slam in 5-2 fit without bypassing 3N [board 4]|pg||
nt|po-s: and they will play for Netherlands in this year´s European Chships|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and yes, they won the event|pg||
nt|petergill: The controversy is that Fantoni - Nunes have been omitted from Italy's team, in order to put Bocchi - Madala in the team|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: but this father-son partnership from France has done very well indeed since joining the Zimmerman squad, so perhaps his action has more appeal than i realise|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=Drury|pg||

nt|vugraphzjd: lots of talking on both sides of screen explaining alerts|pg||
nt|petergill: and Meckstroth's 3@D bid took away just enough bidding space to puch EW overboard|pg||

pc|s3|pg||
nt|farfie: j'ai tout faux:)|pg||
nt|jcmax: And 6@C would be no fun on a @D lead either. and realistically I would expect anyone to bid xxxx in @C with a 1S suit like that!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: results from Round 1 are online at http://www.cavendishinvitational.com/2010/TEAMS1-1S.htm|pg||
nt|davidstern: It may be dated but Brink Drijver's system card http://bridgefiles.net/pdf/2007-brink-driver.pdf|pg||
nt|jcmax: Declarer will most likely play for the @C A onside, ruff a @C in dummy, pitch a @D on a heart and hope for trumps 3-2. Easy game :)|pg||
nt|jcmax: That doesn't look like this year's teams to me yet, Al.|pg||
nt|davidstern: The VG matches are chosen live after the results are in so we are unable to tell you who will be next but it will usually involve the leading teams|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: Brink is pinching his nose and thinking hard|pg||
nt|ahollan1: there's a Bridge Base Forum that lists the open team makeup for the European Championship|pg||
nt|petergill: Almost all (or most?) experts open the very strong South hand 1@H, not 2@C, so that the hand can be bid accurately, without losing bidding space. |pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: sorry John I made a mistake|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think 4@D = Grant Baze covention -- showing BALANCED raise to 4@S|pg||
pc|h8|nt|petergill: Thomas Bessis will delay any @d guess as long as he can, to get info about the opponents' HCPs|pg||
nt|petergill: The defence can get 4 spades (one from ruffing @h's), one heart, and 1 or 2 diamond tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: Both Thomas and Zagorin have the palms of their hands on their cheeks|pg||
nt|jcmax: Yes, but South can only get N in with a @D, so there would be no guess then.|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: on different sides of the table thinkin|pg||
nt|jcmax: But declarer of course may play N for 5@H and go up with the @HA|pg||
nt|petergill: so perhaps North should underlead @DA when he wins @HK, then?|pg||
nt|petergill: if he can play double dummy|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: you might be tempted if you know a weak spot in opponents relay methods - but pass then bid in game forcing auction is huge risk|pg||
nt|petergill: When the opponents had not yet disclosed their suits and were possibly heading slamwards using artificial methods, West rightly thought those conditions made intervention more ...|pg||
nt|petergill: attractive, to reduce the effectiveness of NS's auction |pg||
nt|petergill: and 2@H removes quite a bit of bidding space from NS|pg||
nt|petergill: I'm making quite a good case that Michel Bessis bids better than I do :)|pg||
nt|jcmax: DEclarer may very well feel S is more likely to hold a singleton 1H for his penalty pass than a doubleton|pg||
nt|jcmax: And so he did.|pg||

nt|vugraphzjd: Thank you by Welland|pg||
nt|jcmax: Declarer will probably try to ruff his @C loser before playing 3 rounds of trumps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm not sure why Team Brink not in running total -- or why 20 teams [i thought only 14 playing]|pg||
nt|davidstern: The results are wrong|pg||
nt|davidstern: They refer to a prior year|pg||
nt|davidstern: I am having it fixed|pg||
nt|jcmax: This way if E happens to have a doubleton @C and 3 trumps, he will still make|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: he is still looking at all the hearts down comes the screen|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that is great explanation :)|pg||
nt|jcmax: If he drew 2 rounds of trumps before trying to ruff the @C e would overruf and there would be no entry to dummy's @H-winner|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: up screen|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: down screen again|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i was trying to work out possibilities if win @H then duck @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: delaying choice of discard on 3rd @H|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: up again now hearts still all showing at the table|pg||
nt|ahollan1: since it seems all lines require @CA onside|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: all cards now turned over|pg||
nt|jcmax: It seems to me the only time you can make this contract with the @CA offside is when W has KQ doubleton in @D. But you also have to play for it, and who would do that?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for specs who haven't played using screens -- the screen is lowered so that only one defender asks/answers questions without risking unauthorized info to the other defender|pg||
nt|davidstern: The theory is better than the reality of course|pg||
pc|sK|pg||

pc|h7|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ritong: mais tout ça est académique  onze plis|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now that @H9 is good, doesn't look like West has any good options, but we know that defense can always generate 2nd trump trick|pg||
nt|petergill: To read why, you go to that thread, then follow the links from its 2nd page to the Neapolitan Club website, which has comments from many Italians on the situation.|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|petergill: I agree with Al|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jcmax: Cashing the @CA was an excellent play!|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|petergill: the long weak heart suit, with no dbl of 4@h and no raise by partner, was unpromising as a source of tricks|pg||
nt|petergill: Kevin Bathurst has his cap on, as usual. Daniel Zagorin is to the right of the screen|pg||
nt|jcmax: Because S will be endplayed when ruffing the @H|pg||

nt|petergill: Website http://forums.bridgebase.com/index.php?showtopic=38622&st=15 still lacks scores after Round 4, sorry about that|pg||
nt|petergill: sorry website should say http://www.cavendishinvitational.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=39&Itemid=50|pg||
nt|petergill: I pressed the wrong button|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@H looks likely now, given that the misfit makes slam unlikely|pg||
nt|petergill: or perhaps he's thinking that 4@s will play better opposite 2-3 in majors?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Woolsey had much different problem    1@D-1@S//3@C-?    He chose and is playing 3N|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@S enquiry|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 6-2 fits with good trumps are less susceptible to 4-1 breaks (and thus usually better) than 5-3 fits are|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'd like a recount please|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: oy|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: Wrang looking at spots|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@H = max for 2@H, with four card support|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i was about to ask if 3@C is game force -- sure seems to be interpretation at both tables|pg||
pc|d3|nt|petergill: The normal 3NT contract is doomed on the normal lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but Helness chose 4@S instead of 3N|pg||
nt|jcmax: At the other table the contract is 4@S, which no doubt has better chances than 3!NT on a @D lead|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@S has some play, but the 4-1 club break makes 4@s difficult|pg||
nt|jcmax: Is 3NT so normal? the auction at the other table looks quite plausible to me, too.|pg||

nt|ritong: mon dieu mon dieu mon dieu|pg||
nt|warrens:  no 2@D by me|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's just under 2 hours from now|pg||
pc|s6|nt|marlowepi: ten f clubs meant to increasy chance that queen would be a dummy entry in case diamonds 4-1|pg||
nt|petergill: @H lead looks impossible to find|pg||
nt|petergill: so this might make|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: Thomas thank you|pg||
pc|s9|nt|petergill: 6 @S, 4 @D, 1 @C and 1 @H unless|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ahollan1: agree - no overcall here, but how close?  would change @Hx to @Dx be enough or need lots more opposite passed partner?|pg||
nt|warrens:  oh, a 6th @D makes it automatic.|pg||
nt|warrens:  after the ruff sluff in @D's, this will make because of the favorable @H position|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this set seems to be very declarer friendly|pg||
nt|po-s: of course North can drop HT to encourage declarer to run jack next|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: Thomas has his hands locked behind his head and staring at the dummy|pg||
nt|po-s: or nine rather|pg||
nt|warrens:  he's thinking about how to make with one spade loser and one heart loser|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 22  Zimmerman in North did not bid over 1@H opening -- later DBL convinced Multon to jump to 3@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: now one had covering his mouth|pg||
nt|ahollan1: where Bathurst struggled to make 2@S, Multon made 3@S after @H lead|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|petergill: the transfer response, just as Jacoby Transfers over 1NT do, also allows more space to bid sensibly|pg||
nt|petergill: Back on Bd 3 - it's hard to pass 4@H, because 4@D by East over 3@D would show both majors, not a strong hand with @H's - there are many hands where East bids 4@h and 6@h is cold. I ...|pg||
nt|petergill: blame NS for EW getting overboard, not blame E (just has a 4@H bid not a 3@H bid) nor W |pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: Zia that is he doesn't like it --- Demirev if "its small"|pg||
nt|marlowepi: board 3 of the spring fours?|pg||
nt|petergill: South finds a brilliant low heart switch and East misguesses|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i see it, but still wouldn't have included 5@S in my list of bids to consider|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's why i type instead of play|pg||
nt|petergill: on @H lead, can get rid of club loser and then set up H's (picking @H's), so there was no defence  |pg||
nt|petergill: Huub Bertens is a wonderful card play thinker|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ritong: je n ai aucun commentaire pertinent a proposer|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ahollan1: transfer responses gain in other ways too --- some use 1N rebid to show the hand that normally jump rebids 2N|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: ca ne se fait pas dutout mais je suis écroulé guy me fait rire|pg||
nt|ritong: tiens toi, quentin:-)|pg||
nt|petergill: Yes|pg||
nt|petergill: North tried to drop @SQ, as East would never lead from trump queen|pg||
nt|cavendish: operator, welland and willenkin are US, bessis are french|pg||
nt|ahollan1: still no results posted from round 4 -- sorry folks|pg||
nt|davidstern: So this will now make?|pg||
nt|petergill: Even on @h switch and misguess, North gets squeezed in the minors, so there was no defence|pg||
nt|petergill: @D10 protects partner's jack|pg||
pc|d9|pc|c4|pc|d7|nt|petergill: Sabine's right - the lack of aces in the North hand makes Kx not enough for 3NT, I guess|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: drum roll|pg||
nt|warrens:  N has to play the 9 or 10 now|pg||
nt|petergill: @DA was played, to check that @D7 is an entry to @SQ, I think|pg||
pc|d8|pc|h4|pc|h3|pc|c2|pg||
nt|petergill: Good defence (@H switch) to reduce pressure on East who might otherwise get endplayed on some layouts|pg||
nt|petergill: I think he might play a spade to the king, then back to @SA, then ruff a @D|pg||
pc|d6|pc|c7|pc|c6|nt|ahollan1: too right Peter -- the swing is result of Zia-Meck bidding and defense not EW actions|pg||
nt|jcmax: Of course if South had Q10x in @D instead of just Q10  3NT would be such a superior choice!|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ahollan1: didn't Michael Rosenberg [and probably others] write an article that said basically if you've got the 9 - play it|pg||
pc|c8|pc|hJ|pc|s3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: delaying losing @C finesse as long as possible|pg||
nt|petergill: just in case North is overruffing @d's and has only two spades|pg||
nt|davidstern: And pray thereafter|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|pc|c3|nt|davidstern: However if north is overruffing diamond no real play|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|petergill: he merely needs 4-3 @d's|pg||
nt|davidstern: merely|pg||
nt|petergill: He might take his time about whether to cash @DQ or ruff a small @D - both lines work|pg||
nt|davidstern: On a heart lead no problem as club disappears so no real defence to even test declarer|pg||
nt|petergill: Correct|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but that hand might bid 3N instead of 3@S --- i'm beginning to think that bridge is a tough game|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s2|pc|sQ|pc|s7|pg||
nt|ritong: meme si des gens qui prétendent représenter notre pays ne savent pas comment ils interviennent sur 1 SA fort, tu ne dois pas rire  après, ils vont te crier dessus|pg||
pc|sJ|mc|7|nt|jcmax: It might, but then again with like 10x in @S 3@S would really be a realistic choice as well.|pg||

nt|ahollan1: no surprise if board 5 is push|pg||
nt|poohbear: yes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and you thought you'd seen the last 9 card suit of the day|pg||
nt|petergill: Thomas Bessis's excellent 5@S bid shows how important it is to get to slam in the trump suit that has good quality trumps|pg||
nt|davidstern: 4-3 break is 62.2% so a reasonable slam provided spades break|pg||
nt|davidstern: The OR result may not be that hard to copy|pg||
nt|petergill: North's slow cards - KQJ and Q9 and no supporting club honour, argue for 4@S. With faster tricks and less spade texture, e.g. A10xxx, Kxxx, Kx, QJ, 3NT would appeal more. |pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 850 will be hard to beat|pg||

nt|ahollan1: it's a long known theme in regards to the trump suit -- but Michael's article most recent one that goes beyond trump|pg||
nt|marlowepi: good pass by W with only doubleton spade|pg||

nt|petergill: then) as one of the teammates|pg||
nt|ahollan1: quite a hefty 4@H opener from Helgemo|pg||
nt|ahollan1: another  forcing but not necessarily strong 1@C|pg||
nt|jcmax: If South's 3@C bid denied 4 cards in @H, a point could be made that N's sequence of first bidding 3@H and then 3NT said he didn't have a good @D-stopper. because otherwise he would ...|pg||
nt|jcmax: have bid 3NT immediately.|pg||

nt|jcmax: A good point for partnership discussion :)|pg||
nt|petergill: The leading scores are on the cover page of http://www.cavendishinvitational.com/|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: Dbl might show 4+ hearts|pg||
nt|petergill: At the other table, Woolsey's Dbl of a vulnerable Helgemo showed a lack of faith in Helgemo - still, Helgemo did buy a lucky dummy|pg||
nt|davidstern: Tough on South here|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@C Stayman|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: thanks to spectator who provides Michael's quote "always play a nine on defense ... unless you have to"|pg||
nt|davidstern: Well done by Bertens|pg||
nt|petergill: Kit Woolsey's second Dbl might have been in part to avoid partner going on to 5@S on some layouts|pg||
nt|petergill: This is the last session - this match, then two more 9 board matches.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|jcmax: I suppose N's pass over 2@S is a function of the partnership's light opening style|pg||
pc|s2|nt|warrens:  either W leads a black card, give declarer the contract, or he gets squeezed in the black suits in the endgame|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ritong: c est une position confortable  on a le droit de perdre 10 swings de double partielle|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C "asks distribution"    not sure how that differes from Stayman|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|ahollan1: guessing 1N alert = @C|pg||
nt|petergill: so a flat board|pg||
nt|petergill: 1NT looks like a transfer to clubs |pg||
pc|s3|pc|sJ|nt|petergill: South is not far from bidding 3@s, but there's (almost) no need to overbid at all when Jeff Meckstroth is opposite you. Jeff will never miss a game.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in answer to spec queries, the point of my reference to short spades is this: facing a PH you will not buy the contract since opps rate to have spades. so getting in there can only ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: give them info you cant use|pg||
nt|petergill: EW lead 3rd and 5th versus suits|pg||
pc|s7|nt|warrens:  "giving declarer..."|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: attitude leads|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|petergill: Much the same here - the Dbl was partly intended to stop partner going to 5@S. |pg||
nt|ahollan1: a truly vindictive Bridge God would have @H split 4-0 -- or @CA @C ruff|pg||
nt|petergill: The Wests are wrong when South has a 9 card suit, but right most of the rest of the time. And how likely is "two 9 card @h suits in one match"?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: Huub is says you can't beat me|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|ahollan1: NS  upside down count & attitude -- no mention of Smith Echoes [but wouldn't apply here anyway]|pg||
nt|petergill: Opposite a 1NT overcall, it's best to push in the bidding, as Lev did, because 1NT bidder's high cards lie over the opener's high cards, and 1NT bidder knows who has the missing ...|pg||
nt|petergill: high cards, making a light game playable|pg||
nt|petergill: Sorry, Sam Lev started in Poland then in Israel then in USA, I am told. |pg||
nt|petergill: Both East and North will find the play difficult|pg||
pc|h2|nt|petergill: Perhaps West, with well placed @D's, didn't want to dbl with his stiff king, in case it helped declarer|pg||
nt|ahollan1: premature save against 3N?  how does EW do in that contract|pg||
nt|petergill: West had already downgraded his bare king a lot|pg||

pc|h3|nt|ritong: 2@c un @h et les @ds ne s arrangent pas|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ahollan1: the VP scale in use for this event makes overtricks very important -- except in this range where Zimmerman already pitching a blitz|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|petergill: North ducks the 2nd @D, in part to avoid being on play|pg||

mb|p|nt|petergill: More ultra-aggressive bidding by NS|pg||
nt|petergill: Will Thomas bid 5@h or Pass?|pg||
nt|petergill: 5@H seems to be one level too high|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't think enough shape to pull - but it is close|pg||
nt|ahollan1: show of hands -- how many remember when North hand never thought of any bid but PASS|pg||
nt|warrens:  yes, I like S bidding, especially as a passed hand.  should be -1 in 5@D, assuming good defense |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: obviously that DBL was NOT Responsive, but some form of Rosenkranz [showing @C honor]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i've always suspected that invitational 1m-2N is the least sensible agreement in modern bridge|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: tiens, il cherche la baston|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: Drijver lays down 10 tricks of cards|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ahollan1: nice lead|pg||
nt|davidstern: One of my better predictions|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this might not be that great for EW|pg||
nt|davidstern: Likely only -1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Bus Driver ....  honest|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Helgemo range must be 15-17 because he opened 1@D  Helness treated his @S as 4-bagger so 3N south|pg||
nt|jcmax: With nohcp in his long suit and everything outside N may feel he only wants to play in @S if partner has 4 cards, but not with 3.|pg||
nt|petergill: Daniel Zagorin wsiely treated his weak five card suit as if it was four cards|pg||
nt|jcmax: So I guess the same judgment at both tables really :)|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|farfie: oui,drole d'idée|pg||
nt|petergill: West would expect East to have a singleton spade|pg||
nt|petergill: on this bidding|pg||
nt|ahollan1: surely not enough shape for WELLAND to bid 5@H :)|pg||
nt|petergill: need to change to 5@H by West|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is 4th of 9 9-board matches split into 3 sets of 3 matches|pg||
nt|davidstern: 2-1-1-0|pg||
nt|davidstern: The last three matches do allow for replay of a match played today|pg||
nt|ahollan1: there can be playback of teams, but not within a given 3 match session|pg||
nt|petergill: 5 @C plus 2@S and 2 aces to knock out - you need to knock out South's ace first, but then can the defence plays @Hs?|pg||
nt|petergill: At the other table, East played @D10 from dummy and North rose @DA in case partner had @SAJ10xx and no @HA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wouldn't @SK be better shot than @SJ?|pg||
nt|petergill: That was clever of East to foresee that the defence might do that|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: screen down|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: now up|pg||
nt|petergill: @SK at Trick 1, then @SJ at Trick 2, would clarify the spade position for North|pg||
nt|petergill: but seems a bit double dummy to me. |pg||
nt|ahollan1: i suppose @SJ hoping that partner holds @SA and declarer @SQx(x)|pg||
nt|petergill: On other alyouts - If partner had Ax in spades, @SK lead might wreck the defence if EW have lots of minor suit tricks|pg||

nt|petergill: world is a greater achievement to my eyes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry David -- you got there first|pg||
nt|davidstern: It is my understanding which may be wrong that the playback can only happen tomorrow during sessions 7-9|pg||
nt|petergill: @DJ (to deny @DQ) or 1D9 (suit pref to avoid a @H switch).  |pg||
nt|petergill: @D9|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|petergill: This will drift down one|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: i was thinking that North unlikely to hold an ace - so try @SK hoping dummy has stiff Q|pg||
pc|h6|nt|petergill: Not clear which you should play|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well it is arguable. it means that when you know there is a complex problem on the hand you are excellent at spotting it and solving it. with no disrespect at all to Bart, who is ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: indeed a great player. it isnt a table-real context|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that could be David, i'm less than 100% confident about whether this set can have playback from session 1|pg||
nt|davidstern: My memory is aging and poor at best but I am pretty sure only tomorrow allows for playbacks|pg||
nt|davidstern: and only once|pg||
nt|petergill: club exit is normal, as South is expected to have @HA for the opening bid, and @HAK cannot run away|pg||
nt|marlowepi: bart gave me a zero at the table in Reno by seeing the problem without any probem being tipped. that impressed me|pg||
nt|petergill: @C4 exit makes it harder for South to count the hand out|pg||

nt|ahollan1: this event converting IMPs to VPs using a true 30 VP scale   i.e. blitz = 30-0  whereas WBF scale max win is 25|pg||

nt|petergill: Pepsi's Dbl was important - it's good to get into the bidding when you can, and not worry too much about having only three small in spades|pg||
pc|sT|nt|petergill: if the latter, South can hope that East has doubleton @SA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i bet it was count  [haven't seen Foster Echo used in long time]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sort of like Defensive Driving -- it is the other guy's responsibility not to get into crash :)|pg||

nt|petergill: 3rd seat at Trick 1 can take a long time to think about the whole hand without creating any problem - not as long as this hand took, in my opinion|pg||

pc|h5|pc|d6|pc|h9|pg||
nt|ahollan1: right David -- particularly that means overtricks DO matter a lot [in close matches]|pg||

nt|jcmax: Knowing when to bid 3NT with an 8- or even 9-card major suit fit is a very difficult discipline. I admire everyone who masters it.|pg||
nt|petergill: At imps, 3NT is often better than 4@S or 4@H even with 8 card fits. At matchpoints, one has to bid 4@H or 4@S more often as the "620 beating 600" factor becomes more important than ...|pg||
nt|petergill: one imp|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|davidstern: Only 32 imps for a blitz|pg||

mb|d|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|flash: 1@C on all balanced hands seems to be a reasonable explanation  :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: The extra level of pre-emption from South was doubtless due to the fact that he knew E/W would have a good spade fit.|pg||
nt|chessmaste: I don't care for 4@S - that West hand looks defensive in nature|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: t|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: The double showed 4 or 5 spades but not 5 with a singleton heart|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: especially when partner suggests spades and you have tricks in other two suits|pg||
pc|hK|nt|brolucius: 4@S is not going to be productive even with five spades in the East hand. And he might have held only four.|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: If he has dour spades two falt hands with juicy minors looks defensive|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: four|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes.|pg||

mb|d|nt|ahollan1: Sabine - do you think Wrang had any option other than 1@S?|pg||

pc|hA|nt|ritong: maintenant, son souci est l es atouts|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can they negotiate the @H ruff?   even looking at all 4 hands it takes a good eye to see the best defense|pg||
nt|petergill: EW have tried to transfer the declarer (of spades) to West, but have ended up wrongsiding the declarership of hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: Zia says don;t lead it my lead|pg||
nt|warrens:  makes 6@H by W but only 4 by E|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@S relay, so that 4@h on 4333 opposite 4333 can be avoided in favour of 3NT|pg||
nt|petergill: the relay also allows more accurate slam bidding|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe downgrade hand and 2@C was only path to Inivite  ---  or opportunity to see cool treatment of 2@S|pg||
nt|petergill: West's singleton heart and @SA has encouraged him to go for the jugular (= blood)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: single dummy this actually has some chance of overtrick|pg||
nt|petergill: For anyone looking at MOVIE of Bd 24: On Bd 24, there is an error in the transcribing - on @D10, dummy pitched a heart, not a spade|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: either way --singleton Ace and @Dxxxx makes it a iffy choice|pg||
nt|petergill: Meckstroth likes to play "reverse lead-directing doubles"|pg||
nt|petergill: Club or spade lead is best, but surely a @d lead is most likely in real life|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|c6|nt|warrens:  this is a horrible contract and deserves to go down.  needs 3-2 trump with the K onside, plus more help|pg||

nt|ahollan1: i've heard them called  "anti-lead directing doubles"  but "reverse" fits well too|pg||

nt|jcmax: On this hand E would like dbl to be straight penalty. Unfortunately most pairs don't play it that way.|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|s9|nt|ahollan1: basically this is problem since early days -- RDBL with good hand, then opponent's bid suit where you hold 3 and no good suit -- all choices distasteful|pg||
pc|h7|pc|d3|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dT|nt|ahollan1: screens prevent use of convention where  fast DBL shows different hand from slow DBL   [sorry about that, couldn't resist]|pg||
nt|petergill: Should there be more penalty doubles nowadays, as people push higher on less values than they used to, Sabine?|pg||

mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|brolucius: Well, that was an interesting heart-spade competitive auction. I always used to reckon that I was averaging about minus 1.5 IMPs per auction of that type.|pg||
nt|poohbear: cause it can only go downhill  David :)|pg||

nt|brolucius: You can easily spend a lifetime judging such auctions wrongly. If anyone writes a book on the subject, I will buy it.|pg||

nt|vugraphzxr: oui t es super bon en psycholigie important au bridge:)|pg||
nt|ritong: j aimerais pas etre a sa place|pg||
nt|ritong: encore une main de stayman|pg||
nt|ritong: musclée, cette fois|pg||
nt|ritong: leenhardt pourrait imposer la manche|pg||
nt|ahollan1: especially with trump entry to dummy [22 trump or singleton @S10]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: at least i don't think that they are a well established partnership|pg||
nt|petergill: Club shift more or less places West with @CK, so perhaps the "heart before @D" play could have been found|pg||
nt|petergill: West's greedy Double was perhaps influenced by his rubber bridge activities in which taking penalties from unwary vulnerable takeout doublers is a favourite for most experts |pg||
nt|ahollan1: last board of this match -- 2 more 9 board matches remain to finish out the event|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|nt|davidstern: Only 8 tricks N/S in NT and 4@D for E/W|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 6 was 300 (2SX) to 200 (4@S -4) as we expected = 3 imps|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: Roy pulls out 2 spades bid and pputs back|pg||
nt|petergill: 2 and a half spades perhaps?|pg||
nt|davidstern: 2.275|pg||
nt|ahollan1: some pairs use 2N as spade raise -- that would work well here with in-between hand|pg||
nt|davidstern: IMHO|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: now bids 3 clubs and is writing to Thomas|pg||
nt|petergill: or 3@D? or Dbl? Not 3@s which is weak |pg||
nt|ahollan1: I sort of like 2@S  intending to bid 3@H given the opportunity|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe that brings DBL into Welland's options|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: This is the last board of the day|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=15-17, not 5@H/@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: usually 15-20 minute break between rounds|pg||
mb|1S|nt|vugraphzxr: non c est sr il sait qu il est a moins l infini pas cool au moment d aller faire les points|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: meyer stretz c est leur deuxieme finale perdue|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 1D|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: en tout cas il y songe|pg||
nt|davidstern: Apparently 3@C is a transfer to 3@D|pg||
nt|davidstern: which is cue raise|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@C might show hearts and 2@H show clubs, if they are into switching responder's bids when two suits have been bid |pg||
nt|ahollan1: and none of us saw THAT coming :(|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: moren writing on both sides of the screen|pg||
nt|davidstern: Migry was suggesting it to me|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Diamond will open West hand on  8 1N [14-16]   I suspect he'll declare @H also|pg||
nt|petergill: The most recent thread about Jeff Meckstroth on BBO Forums (discussion group) is http://forums.bridgebase.com/index.php?showtopic=38901|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C alert because does not promise a 4-card major|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: now P-P-3@C//P-3N ??|pg||
nt|marlowepi: advantage of not playing precision, u can open 1D here and have it be worthwhile|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: enter and sign in please|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or maybe DBL now|pg||
nt|petergill: Directly to 4@S in case EW can make something, or slowly to explore our best spot? I think North has done it right|pg||
nt|jcmax: It is really a two-edged sword in my opinion, because very often you want to double to show values and hope partner will bid. difficult to have it both ways :)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ritong: ben, ils seront sans doute en situation de décider si ils sauvent une journée ou pas, c est triste pour eux|pg||
nt|davidstern: Welcome to Warren Spector|pg||
nt|warrens:  hi all.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i thought DBL was a reach -- hence my 1st guess|pg||
nt|warrens:  is 3@C forcing? |pg||
nt|petergill: We will see two more 9 board matches tonight after this one|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidstern: Defence needs to get clubs going|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@D - to get the good four card support in - is normal among experts - 3@D is for wimps|pg||
nt|davidstern: Before declarer gets heart going|pg||
nt|petergill: Zia has a near maximum for 1D :)|pg||
nt|petergill: I am kidding|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@d negative|pg||
nt|ahollan1: last board of the set -- 1 more 9-board match tonight then 3 tomorrow|pg||
nt|ahollan1: side note: initial transfers for NS only promise 4|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidstern: I will take my leave to get ready for the next match and try and fix the webcam issue. Thanks for your company|pg||
nt|warrens:  looks like 3NT is the easiest game.  5@D a bid tougher|pg||
nt|ahollan1: do panelists rebid 3@D or 2@D holding void in responder's suit?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: after all these hands -- we don't even know if 1@C is always strong or  2-way [ala Baltic Club] and one-round force|pg||
nt|petergill: in the webcam at the bottom of http://www.cavendishinvitational.com, |pg||
nt|petergill: Thomas Bessis is the young French guy to the left of the screen, and the silvery haired guy to the right of the screen is John Mohan|pg||
mb|p|nt|farfie: logique|pg||
nt|ritong: voila qui est fait|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the way Sabine & Daniela bid 'em up -- i suspect she wouldn't like her opponent's to adopt more penalty doubles |pg||
pc|dK|nt|ahollan1: do either of you know -- which Bessis is dad, which is son?|pg||
nt|petergill: Interesting lead|pg||
nt|davidstern: Michel Dad Thomas Son|pg||
nt|warrens:  certainly not everyone plays it so|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good / tough question Warren    what IS the default?|pg||
nt|jcmax: Yes, I like all opponents that don't double :)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|vugraphzxr: tout ça est bien joué:)|pg||
pc|d8|nt|ritong: egalité a 420  bien vu Q|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: plutot normal de jouer la manche et de la filer je pense|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: enfin bien joué de la déclarer et après on voit|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: patrice devrait mettre un petit du mort|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: pour garder une remontée au mort |pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: qu est ce que vous en pensez|pg||
nt|ritong: méjane aura un tit souci sur le @s suivant, si ce n est pas l as|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: oui|pg||
nt|warrens:  Ivote for 3@D.  Lots of playing strength.|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|petergill: If NS have a 4-4 heart fit, I think the spade suit quality is not robust enough to make spades better than hearts. |pg||
pc|s8|nt|petergill: I think over 50% of top experts would open South's hand 1@d in 3rd seat at this vulnerability. I certainly would|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes it is not good enough for 5D so 1D it is|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not positive but next set usually 15-20 minutes after match ends|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: wow -- everybody knew except me|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so the partnership needs to discuss East's 2nd actions of DBL, 2N and 3 new suit|pg||
nt|petergill: South is Huub Bertens from Netherlands|pg||
nt|ritong: bertens/bakkeren won the pairs event not so long ago|pg||
nt|petergill: It's not clear that this is a singleton - running the @d is possible|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@D is good as a lead-directer, plenty of safety from the vulnerability, opposite a passed (North) hand EW are likely to have game on and 1@D makes it harder for EW to bid ...|pg||
nt|petergill: accurately|pg||
nt|marlowepi: excellent summary. plus if zia passed, there would be a UN enquiry|pg||
nt|petergill: Meckstroth never says "thanks you partner", even when he strikes a dummy as good as this one|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 25, where we talked about Pepsi double of 2@H with @Sxxx --- Zhao took phantom save to 10@H [5@HX]|pg||
nt|petergill: On Bd 8, NS can just, but only just, beat 3NT, so minus 160 might be close to a flat board, instead of the disaster it looks like. |pg||
nt|petergill: On Bd 26 I mean|pg||
nt|petergill: Mahaffey won this event narrowly last year, with a big win in the last match|pg||
nt|petergill: First prize is $43,000|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: 7-5, 3 aces, supporting quacks -- too right, 2@D would be very timid|pg||
pc|sT|nt|petergill: No problem in finding the vital switch|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but absolute best response   "the older one is the dad"  :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: THAT lead could make things much easier|pg||
nt|po-s: how would yoy ever be able to catch back later otherwise?|pg||
pc|d4|nt|petergill: with North having a weak hand on the bidding, leading away from a king is possible|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  8  Diamond playing 6@H west -- gets @H lead    oh my|pg||
nt|petergill: Webcam is at the bottom of http://www.cavendishinvitational.com|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3 matches starting tomorrow morning 10:30 Las Vegas time -- then the evening is spent bidding on pairs for the main event|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ahollan1: i think declarer was stil going to get @H right -- as an avoidance play to protect @CK|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ritong: mais piganeau ne crache pas sur la possibilité d un honneur sec en est|pg||
pc|dT|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|petergill: On webcam, we are the table on the right - Sam Lev is to the left of the screen  |pg||
pc|d5|nt|warrens:  I still doubt he'll make it.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|vugraphzxr: je ne comprends pas de rejouer @h|pg||
nt|ritong: il semble naturel de jouer @c maintenant|pg||
nt|marlowepi: world-class players don;t get a lot of experience decidig which unforced moysian fit to play|pg||
pc|d6|pc|h9|pg||
nt|petergill: I think that the idea is that by saying "thank you partner" your tone might help the defenders estimate how happy you are with the contract, so they keep silent on all matters at ...|pg||
nt|petergill: the bridge table including that one|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|nt|ritong: et l affaire est pliée|pg||
nt|petergill: Thomas Bessis was one of the best juniors (Under 26) in the world until he turned 26 not that long ago|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can we rewind -- i want to see how auction goes if Welland tries 2@S|pg||
nt|petergill: Alex Smirnov at the other table is the same age as Thomas - mid to late 20's|pg||
nt|davidstern: 27 I think|pg||
nt|petergill: NS's ultra-bold bidding on Bd 7 gained 12 imps for their side|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Alex had great run in big Australian Team event this year -- he was old man with junior Aussies and New Zealand transplant teammates|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i dont know anyone who says thank you partner in live bridge|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|pg||
nt|petergill: Sorry, I stand corrected - Jeff has started regularly saying Thank You partner|pg||
mc|11|nt|ahollan1: this is our last board of the session   next group of 3 9-board matches scheduled to begin in 1 hour 20 minutes|pg||
nt|warrens:  I don't understand why S played the @S K at trick one|pg||
nt|warrens:  but nothing matters much on this hand|pg||
nt|petergill: still, that was the normal start to the play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Zimmerman began the day with a 9 VP lead over 2nd place Bathurst and 16 over 3rd Diamond -- this blitz will leave the others with a LOT of work to do|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: Thanks commentators for your help and we will restart in about 20 minutes|pg||
nt|jcmax: Thanks all, too!|pg||
