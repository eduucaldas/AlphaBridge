nt|brolucius: Difficult evaluation for South now. The void spade is no advantage.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, best to keep quiet about that, Catalina.|pg||
mb|4C|nt|henryb:  Good Evening David, and hello kibitzers|pg||
nt|brolucius: Reasonable to bid 4@C and hope for the best.|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: I will say that I was using mine and it is David Stern - Cata Hijacked me|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Hi, Henry!|pg||

nt|vugraphzjf: Hi from a coolish Las Vegas|pg||
pc|dT|nt|brolucius: You can see how the play would be easier if South held a singleton spade to lead towards the king.|pg||

nt|brolucius: South was marked as very short in spades, by his preference back to clubs. So East might have led a trump initially.|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: Jacki is controlling all commentators not us|pg||
nt|brolucius: Controlling?!|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: Sorry private|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: OK organising|pg||
nt|henryb:  placing the @hK in East for the negative double, perhaps the best play is a heart to the ace and a heart|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: Fredin deep in thought - not an easy hand|pg||
nt|brolucius: During the auction that precedes this event, each pair has to be sole for at least Â£12,500. If no-one rates you that highly, you have to pay the money yourself. That is why I do ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: not enter...|pg||
pc|d3|nt|henryb:  although he knows suits are breaking well -- so perhaps the successful line is best: @hA, @s ruff, @d ruff @s ruff, draw trumps, concede spade|pg||

pc|s4|pc|s9|pc|c4|pc|sT|pg||
nt|brolucius: If a pair is shown as $12,500 in the listing, it is a good bet that they bought themselves.|pg||

nt|vugraphzjf: Next Round Table 1 Garner/Mahmood Levin/Weinstein and at this table Helness/Helgemo Wijs/Muller|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: Not a good bet a certain bet|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: They must bid $12.5k as opening bid so it must be them|pg||

nt|vugraphzjf: Carding asked UDC answer|pg||
pc|s2|nt|brolucius: Helgemo/Helness were part of the team that ran away with the Cavendish Teams, earlier in the week. When I watched  them (in the Zimmerman team) yesterday, they won 35-0 and 38-0. ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: Didn't drop an IMP, even though playing against such as Zia/Meckstroth.|pg||
