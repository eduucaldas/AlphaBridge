nt|flash: 2@C starting relay sequence|pg||
nt|flash: in general, a relay sequence will first establish the 'teller's' shape, then size/controls|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: Ok now we reached them|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: welcome back, sorry for the slow start|pg||
nt|flash: well done, Catalina  :)|pg||
nt|davidstern: Apologies for the mix up - MY FAULT - the seating was opposite to what I thought (thought in inverted commas)|pg||
nt|flash: welcome to David Stern|pg||
nt|davidstern: Hi Jim|pg||
nt|flash: i'm getting some prompting from someone familiar with the N-S system|pg||
nt|flash: 1NT either minimum or strong, balanced|pg||
nt|flash: 2@C asks|pg||
nt|flash: 2@D shows minimum|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4D|nt|flash: a bit unusual to have a relay response 5 steps higher than the ask|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidstern: Anyone for 6@D|pg||
nt|davidstern: or 6NT for that matter|pg||
nt|flash: but we'd assume that North has now shown 3433 in a minimum hand|pg||
nt|davidstern: DeK may bid 7NT if shooting|pg||
nt|davidstern: There is the CR result 1440|pg||
nt|flash: we expected the Closed Room auction to be a bit briefer, but we only got a summary|pg||
nt|flash: North didn't open 6NT there, i assure you   :)|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|flash: on Board 19, the 4-3 @H game didn't make; so 12 IMPs to Zimmermann|pg||
nt|davidstern: For thos esuggesting 7NT is cold Deep Finesse refutes the notion|pg||
nt|flash: if, indeed, South's calls are all relays, North's hesitations seem strange|pg||
nt|davidstern: If South will only make on a spade lead|pg||
nt|flash: 1@C - 1@D - 1NT - 6NT in the other room, i'm told|pg||

mb|3N!|nt|flash: welcome to PO Sundelin|pg||
nt|davidstern: I would have tried 3@H as East as partner is marked with a singleton spade|pg||
nt|davidstern: Hi PO|pg||
nt|po-s: short heart|pg||
nt|flash: so 3@C would have shown all minimums|pg||
nt|davidstern: As East I mean of course|pg||
nt|po-s: right|pg||
mb|5H|nt|flash: we've seen this before from Zimmermann - passing initially and then coming in at a much higher level|pg||
mb|p|nt|po-s: that is otherwise one of Fredin´s specialties|pg||
nt|flash: it seems to be quite disconcerting for the opps|pg||

nt|vugraphzjf: "for my partner" lots of laughings heere|pg||

nt|flash: 75 minutes time limit; 10-minute grace period|pg||
nt|davidstern: Easy for the winners to laugh|pg||
mb|7H|mb|d|mb|p|nt|davidstern: Given their position in the tourney N/S may try 7@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|flash: and again, they find the great save|pg||
nt|davidstern: So another 12 to Zimmermann|pg||
nt|davidstern: This team is almost unstoppable|pg||
nt|davidstern: For those interested this evening there is a cocktail party and dinner including the auction for the 46 players in the main pairs game|pg||
nt|flash: our commentary coach has suggested that, given the previous results, 7@S by N-S might be a reasonable stab at recouping some IMPs|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: Zimmermann now told me since multon wants a doctor for him, just tell the doctor he needs a aspirin only|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|pc|s3|pc|s2|pg||
nt|davidstern: Perhaps the drop of 350 points in the stock market and the fall in the Euro the pool may struggle to reach 1 million|pg||
nt|flash: given the scoring table, that would only have risked another 5 IMPs|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h2|mc|10|nt|flash: North's card there should be suit preference?   so perhaps upside-down suit preference as well|pg||
nt|davidstern: As suggested Zimmermann team now has $35k more to spend although some may belong to players|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1N=15-17  and obviously 5M 422 is allowed |pg||
mb|2C|mb|3H|nt|ahollan1: this hand reminds me of problem seen with many club players who use 4-suit transfers|pg||
mb|3S|nt|jbgood: so it took 3 boards into the third match today for Zimmerman to lose imps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i.e. what is transfer to minor then bid of a major?|pg||
mb|4H|mb|5H|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: most experts say shortness, but many club players think natural|pg||
nt|ahollan1: make sure you are on the same page as partner|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|nt|vugraphzjd: Tor is shaking his head and looking at the ceiling|pg||
nt|ahollan1: if you think natural -- then must differentiate  1N-2@C//2x-3minor|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: lets out a sigh|pg||
nt|jbgood: not knowing about the clubs - Tor will pass |pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: shaking his head and closing his eyes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe Tor, like us, wondering if 5@H taken as Exclusion Key Card|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: Helgemo is looking at this fingers then his hand|pg||
nt|jbgood: and then his arm?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: Tor is raising his eyebrows higher than his glasses|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: Tor now has his hand across his mouth|pg||
