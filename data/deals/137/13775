pc|c4|pc|cT|pc|cJ|pg||

nt|flash: this is  12 vs  16|pg||
nt|vugraphzje: 12 vs 8|pg||
nt|vugraphzje: screen down . East asking questions|pg||

nt|vugraphzje: didnt even get enuff tips to bet a hand of Blackjack|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|pc|h7|pc|hA|pg||
nt|flash: the @D play was an attempt to attack dummy entries|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|pc|c3|pc|c2|pg||

mb|1C|an|alerted|mb|p|mb|1S|an|alerted|nt|chorush: Look like this will be a flat 6NT or 6 spades contract. 6NT is a better contract|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|vugraphzje: I think they are playing a Polish @c system|pg||
nt|vugraphzje: so opener has shaown a weak NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: yes - they call it Baltic Club because one originally from Russia and the other from Poland|pg||
mb|2H!|an|either 7-9 or 12+ with 5 !s|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|flash: 1@S was natural and positive|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|flash: http://www.ecatsbridge.org/documents/files/ConventionCards/2008Pau-european/OpenTeams/Germany/piekarek-smirnov.pdf|pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: for the convention card, although they will have dropped a couple conventions to comply with the Conditions of Contest here|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|vugraphzje: Piekarek writing down things for Multon|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|nt|vugraphzje: screen is North East|pg||
nt|vugraphzje: and South West|pg||
nt|vugraphzje: Smirnov tanking now|pg||
nt|flash: i'm told that the 2@H rebid showed 7-9 or 12+ with 5+ @Ss|pg||
nt|flash: East has show @S support and 2 key cards (in this case Aces)|pg||
nt|chorush: Smirnov has a problem; if he knew that East held the heart K he would choose 6NT, but if East has the club K, he would want 6 spades|pg||
nt|vugraphzje: Piekarek checking out board 1 while the tray is on the other side|pg||
nt|flash: RKCB was preceded by control bidding|pg||
nt|flash: so East has shown a @H control (which West has cleverly worked out is the King)|pg||
nt|flash: (and East wouldn't have shown the @H control without a @C control as well?)|pg||
nt|vugraphzje: must be thinking about 6NT  . Knows partner has King ace ace  6@s only feels right when there is an unlikely ruff in the dummy|pg||
nt|flash: so the question remains:  what is West supposed to do with the 3 small @Cs?|pg||
mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzje: lots of discussion on both sides of the screen|pg||
pc|s3|nt|flash: East dutifully provides fillers in the @C suit and there are actually 13 tricks available|pg||
nt|vugraphzje: Multon asks what 1@d opener would show. Told usually 5 unless 4-4-4-1|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|nt|flash: if East didn't have the @C honors, he might have had a doubleton @C, so slam was certainly reasonable|pg||

nt|stewball: even 7 tricks will be a struggle|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||
pc|sK|nt|flash: either the @C hook now or knock out the @DA; @C hook seems likely, since can force @D entry to repeat it if needed|pg||
pc|c8|pc|s3|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|s6|pc|d3|pc|h2|nt|flash: 2 more @Ss and 2 red Aces...|pg||

pc|cA|pc|c5|pc|c9|pc|d4|pg||
nt|vugraphzje: that brought declarer to a screaming halt|pg||
nt|flash: as the tables re-open and the pair names are posted, you can pick the pairs you prefer to watch|pg||
nt|vugraphzje: leans into the table and starts thinking|pg||
nt|chorush: as well it might. if he cashes the club J he will squeeze the dummy|pg||
nt|vugraphzje: 2 min grace|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d5|pc|d9|pc|dT|pg||
