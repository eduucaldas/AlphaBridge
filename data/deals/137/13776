nt|petergill: Axx in the opponent's suit can often be just one winner and four losers in NT, so Sam Lev preferred to double rather than bid 2NT or 1NT|pg||
nt|petergill: most of the Wests will bid NT|pg||

nt|petergill: If East ruffs the third spade, as he should have, he seems to have 8 tricks, as the cards lie|pg||
pc|h4|nt|marlowepi: pepsi needed four of hearts, system not that fine-tuned|pg||

mb|2C|nt|ritong: close to an invite|pg||
nt|ritong: he does|pg||
mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Wrang opened with Lev's hand and now declaring 3N instead of 2@H|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|ritong: but north will decline|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|d3|nt|petergill: 2@S invitational|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, although N really has about the best dummy he could have to pass. perfect doubleton and all controls outdside|pg||
nt|petergill: with less than invit hand, South would simply transfer to 2@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and with better Invite  transfer then 2N [or 3@S]|pg||
nt|ritong: not really, al|pg||
nt|marlowepi: form of scoring heavily rewards big-ticket items (games & slams)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or  then use transfer then 2N as forcing|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d8|pc|d9|pg||
nt|ritong: invite is done the way we are watching|pg||
pc|sT|nt|petergill: 3NT on Board 4 looks doomed, in my opinion|pg||

pc|s2|pc|s3|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c2|pc|c8|pc|c4|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c7|pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: one treatment for 1N-2@H;2@S-2N forcing is to use it to differentiate 3 new suit rebid as 5 cards, with 2N for some side 4 card suit|pg||
nt|petergill: In the auction at http://www.cavendishinvitational.com/2010/FRIBULL2010.pdf last night, EW sold for $35,000 and |pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: Will South move over 2@C?|pg||
mb|p|pc|hJ|nt|petergill: 2@C denies four spades, else North would rebid 1@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: Thomas says nice card the ten of clubs|pg||
nt|marlowepi: as N i would be amazed to get to open 1C in 4th seat, and further gobsmacked to buy it at 2C|pg||

pc|c2|pc|cQ|pc|cT|pc|c5|pg||
nt|ritong: it might be the key for a borderline 3 NT, that means|pg||
nt|petergill: and the singleton club is bad for 3NT, so South was happy to settle for a club partscore|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h3|pc|h9|pc|c4|pg||
pc|cK|nt|ritong: but not today|pg||
pc|d8|nt|petergill: With 6 or 7 tricks in your own hand, you have to open the North hand in 4th seat. |pg||
pc|d3|pc|c6|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|s2|pc|d5|nt|ritong: marshall means that he finds it amazing noone moved before north, i suppose|pg||

nt|petergill: yes, I see|pg||
nt|marlowepi: no i am not saying that|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c9|pc|h6|nt|marlowepi: i am not elliptical. it is just rare to have the N hand in 4th seat and see PPP|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|s5|nt|marlowepi: and rarer to buy it at 2C|pg||
nt|petergill: North is a bit strong for 3@C in 4th seat. Would miss 3NT opposite some hands that have the useful CAxx in them|pg||
nt|marlowepi: no critique of anyone intended, except of Vietnam War|pg||
nt|ritong: hay marshall|pg||
nt|petergill: side aces are very good indeed when you have a long suit|pg||
nt|ritong: i now see how to picture you|pg||
nt|ritong: the guy who screamed "gooooood morning vietnam"|pg||
