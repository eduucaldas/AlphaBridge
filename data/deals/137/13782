mb|p|mb|p|nt|stewball: I wonder why W didnt try NT|pg||
nt|vugraphzje: needed to show 5@H|pg||
pc|cT|nt|chorush: Roger Lee tells me that NS play 4 card majors|pg||
nt|vugraphzje: deutsch asking about 3@s and told it was an acceptance of game try|pg||
nt|reisig: Well ..that makes a diff|pg||
nt|vugraphzje: Zhao leaning into table thinking |pg||

pc|h3|nt|reisig: :)|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h6|pc|hQ|pg||

nt|vugraphzje: Takeout dbl ?  1NT? 2@d?|pg||
nt|flash: X seems most flexible|pg||
nt|reisig: Pass ...1NT   ... 2@d|pg||
nt|chorush: 40 years ago 1 choice|pg||
nt|vugraphzje: dbl|pg||
mb|1N|nt|reisig: and X|pg||
mb|2S|nt|flash: lebensohl to 3@H??|pg||
mb|3H|nt|flash: if they play such a modern contraption|pg||
nt|vugraphzje: doubt these guys play lebensohl|pg||
mb|p|nt|chorush: I would get to 3H if i could|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzje: Zhao staring at Deutsch's green card. Kinda surprised|pg||
nt|flash: 17 trumps; right to bid again??|pg||
nt|reisig: He will|pg||
mb|3S|nt|stewball: does the law apply to 3rd seat openers?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|flash: delicately|pg||
nt|chorush: looks like 8 tricks for each side making pass the winner|pg||
nt|vugraphzje: swap the rounded aces and 4@h might make unless they find a ruff|pg||
nt|davidstern: Heart lead may see club disappear|pg||
nt|reisig: X here is thin...at MPs ...OK|pg||
nt|vugraphzje: today 3 is going down|pg||
nt|chorush: true that the cards lie badly for NS|pg||

nt|flash: taking a break from yeoman-like work as operator|pg||
nt|vugraphzje: Zhao apologises if its wrong|pg||
nt|vugraphzje: the pre apology as it were|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dT|pc|d4|pg||
nt|davidstern: Three rounds diamonds is OK as declarer can throw hearts on 3rd and then fourth round|pg||
nt|flash: and now the @D spots will let this make??|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d9|pc|d3|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|reisig: Nice bid :)|pg||

nt|davidstern: So was not makeable on 3 rounds of diamonds|pg||
nt|davidstern: Would make on heart lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzje: table talking about 3 @h|pg||
nt|flash: it was - needed to ruff high??|pg||
nt|vugraphzje: decide it was going down|pg||
nt|davidstern: Ruff high and then what?|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|vugraphzje: it was going down Flash|pg||
nt|vugraphzje: next case|pg||
nt|reisig: 6N prob the popular spot|pg||
nt|flash: play Ace and a @S and use @HA as re-entry to @Ds??|pg||
nt|davidstern: Ah yes ruff high would have been OK can establish club for heart or heart fro club|pg||
nt|chorush: If Seymon gets exuberant Kranyak will make 7|pg||
nt|stewball: nasty @s break here,,7 is not bad|pg||
nt|chorush: not spades however|pg||
mb|3C|nt|davidstern: Seven whats|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|stewball: 7 no spades|pg||
nt|chorush: NT makes with the lucky heart lie|pg||
mb|4C|nt|flash: Stayman - who says they haven't modernized their game??|pg||
nt|davidstern: 12 top tricks have to believe @HQ and double heart finesse|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidstern: Or maybe black suit squeeze as well|pg||
nt|vugraphzje: Jack looked like he fell asleep for a second. Deutsch has to prod him |pg||
mb|4S|nt|chorush: lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidstern: Ah an undo|pg||
nt|reisig: I got the contract right ...at least|pg||
mb|6N|mb|p|nt|flash: Kranyak shows the 5th @S; Deutsch bids what he hopes Kranyak can make|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: not yet richie|pg||
nt|ritong: now ok|pg||
nt|reisig: Henri!!   :)|pg||
nt|flash: bienvenue a Henri Schweitzer|pg||
nt|vugraphzje: Deutsch had pulled out the 6NT card and I thought he had bid it|pg||
nt|ritong: other room a s ad accident|pg||
nt|chorush: what happened Henri?|pg||
nt|ritong: over 4@s, krekorian inquired about aces|pg||
nt|vugraphzje: butt when I looked for jack's pass I looked again and Deutsch hadn't bid yet|pg||
nt|stewball: typical 2nt result,,this is the sort of hand that Italians would feast on in the old days|pg||
nt|ritong: and got left down..|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|h2|nt|vugraphzje: laim on dbl Sq now|pg||
nt|vugraphzje: can claim|pg||
nt|reisig: yes...a claim|pg||
pc|c4|pc|s6|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h3|pc|hA|nt|petergill: The auction at the other BBO table was the same until 4@s, over which South's 4NT was passed, so Deutsch's practical 6NT bid has some advantages. |pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|vugraphzje: leaning in|pg||
nt|vugraphzje: claiming on dbl Sq|pg||
nt|flash: for advancing players, the mantra of the double squeeze is:  LHO has to protect @Hs; RHO has to protect @Ss; no one can protect @Cs|pg||
nt|vugraphzje: always faster to play it out than to claim on dbl SQ!!!|pg||
nt|vugraphzje: closing|pg||
nt|flash: back soonest|pg||
nt|petergill: webcam http://www.cavendishinvitational.com/webcam/1/table1.jpg shows only West and North, so we coudln't see South's reaction at the other table|pg||
