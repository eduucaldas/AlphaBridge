nt|petergill: EW have 24 HCP, but NS have better shape and have the boss suit, so this is NS's hand|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|pc|c3|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|petergill: 590 will soon be the score, assuming declarer picks the trumps|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pc|h9|pc|h7|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c7|pc|cQ|pc|s9|pg||
nt|petergill: I guess EW more or less have to double, in case NS's diamonds are 2-2 instead of 4-0, in which case 300 is on offer|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d4|nt|petergill: It's possible to misguess spades, but the odds favour the finesse|pg||
pc|s3|pc|d3|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|pc|d9|pc|hT|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h4|pc|d2|pc|h2|pg||
nt|petergill: with ten trumps, finesse ... with 11 trumps, play to drop the king ... unless other considerations change the odds|pg||
pc|c9|pc|d8|pc|s8|pc|c8|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d5|pc|s5|pc|dT|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s2|nt|petergill: Declarer knew from the 2nd t/o dbl that East had at least 3 hearts, so cashing the hearts was safe|pg||
nt|petergill: Welcome to Rich Reisig|pg||
nt|reisig: I bet ...finesse|pg||
nt|reisig: thx Peter :)|pg||

mb|1D!|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@D=2+@D, 11-15 HCP|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|petergill: I think with a bare king, East might be more likely to pass out 4@S, but I don't know|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=11-13|pg||
nt|petergill: Hi Al|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hi peter, rich  ---   i'm just here to provide system info|pg||
nt|petergill: The Cavendish has 3 board rounds. IMPs Scoring. |pg||

mb|2H!|mb|p|nt|petergill: 50 pairs, so 49 rounds in 5 sessions of 9 or 10 rounds per session|pg||
mb|3S!|mb|p|nt|petergill: 2@D artificial GF|pg||
nt|ahollan1: actually -- only 46 pairs playing in spite of what daily bulletin showed from auction|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: lots of writing between greco and diamond|pg||
mb|3N!|nt|vugraphzjf: now between platnick and hampson\|pg||
nt|ahollan1: I don't know the Diamond-Platnick sequences after 1N rebid :( |pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: I see the writing but can't read it from where I am sitting :(|pg||
nt|petergill: Sorry, 46 pairs, 27 boards per session - at one stage, they expected up to 50 pairs, but only 46 made it to the starting line|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: sometimes the player's will hand me the sheets of paper |pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|nt|vugraphzjf: writing again by Platnick to Hampson|pg||
nt|petergill: webcam at the bottom of http://www.cavendishinvitational.com/|pg||
nt|reisig: Now 4@h = @c cue?|pg||
nt|petergill: webcam of other table at http://www.cavendishinvitational.com/webcam/1/table1.jpg|pg||
nt|petergill: webcam of our table at http://www.cavendishinvitational.com/webcam/2/table2.jpg|pg||
mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|nt|petergill: John Diamond on the left, Geoff Hampson on the right, in webcam|pg||
mb|5C|nt|fabsayc: undo operator|pg||
nt|petergill: 4NT by E not N|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: Greco holds up 3 fingers to Diamond who shakes his head yes|pg||
nt|marlowepi: there are places, and there were times, when this auction would consist of 2 bids: 1N-6N. nowadays we get our money's worth out of entry fees:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|nt|reisig: Marshall!  |pg||
mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|nt|petergill: We don't know what the responses to 2@D meant|pg||
mb|6N|mb|p|nt|ritong: marshall likes to play it provocative:-)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|reisig: I must run ...I know that makes the specs happy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i can tell you that 1@D-2@H/@S show major 2 suiters, so no strong jump shift available|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: Greco fanning and closing his cards|pg||
nt|petergill: Thanks for helping Rich|pg||
nt|marlowepi: my remark was not meant as critial. edgar is not here to say it.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D could be a) art gf  b) transfer  c) other|pg||
nt|marlowepi: detailed methods are fabulous. only sometimes they work overtime. it is not a critticism, only a smiling reflection|pg||
pc|s5|nt|petergill: should score up as 1020 - it's normal to finesse @C10 (not @CQ) first, in case KJ are both onside |pg||
nt|ahollan1: normal 2-way checkback response to 2@D would have been 2@S to show 3@S and 2@H would show 4@H -- so we're in unknown territory here|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: eight minutes announced on board|pg||

pc|sJ|pc|h2|nt|petergill: IMP scoring so the main thing is to reach slam - 6@S is OK  |pg||
pc|c8|pc|c2|pg||
pc|s9|pc|c6|pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: the tables are not connected because "Pairs" but you can watch multiple rooms using http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/ |pg||

pc|h6|pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|hA|pc|d9|nt|petergill: Normal and costfree to cash the long suit, and two top hearts before playing the club finesse |pg||
pc|h5|pc|h3|pg||
nt|ritong: but three @hs is a lot|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c7|pc|cT|pc|c9|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d6|pc|d5|pc|dT|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d7|pc|dK|nt|petergill: cashing all the top hearts before the club finesse, exposing a heart loser, was not expected|pg||

nt|petergill: perhaps West didn't actually play the hand that way?|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: this 1@D also 2+@D, 11-15 HCP|pg||

pc|s8|pc|sJ|pc|s5|pc|sA|pg||
nt|marlowepi: almost an Alexandre Dumas title ... "Twenty years After"|pg||
nt|petergill: We're fiarly confident East did not play the previous hand as transcribed|pg||
nt|ritong: it does not really matters anyway|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hard to get to NT from the N side, but that spade holding is one where you'd need to|pg||
nt|petergill: clubs or diamonds now?|pg||
nt|petergill: want to finesse twice in clubs if @CK is onside|pg||
pc|d3|nt|marlowepi: henri means that the French Press will just invent something anyway:)|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dJ|pc|d5|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: very hard to see greco cards|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d6|nt|petergill: but diamonds will set up extra tricks for sure|pg||
