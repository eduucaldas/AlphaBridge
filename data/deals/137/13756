mb|p|nt|flash: Round 2 - again, we had some minor problems at the site|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|flash: although it's early, i'm sure at least a few tables will get a 2@S overcall by North?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|poohbear: barf|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s2|nt|flash: the East hand is a bit uncomfortable for those playing inverted minors - raise seems superior to 1NT, but no raise fits the hand|pg||

pc|c8|nt|flash: i believe Barry just opined that a 2@S call, vulnerable, on that hand is beyond aggressive...|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c4|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|poohbear: actually I am just hung over from the auction party last night|pg||

nt|poohbear: bought Passell and Casen for 16K|pg||
nt|flash: had to strip dummy of the @H card, i believe|pg||
nt|flash: still not out of the woods...   Zia has to cash the @SA here - Weinstein won't have a comfortable pitch??|pg||
nt|flash: for security reasons, scores are not posted until the end of the session|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|flash: some play 3NT as a raise to the 4-level with an outside defensive card, but South's trumps seem far too good for that to be in play here|pg||
pc|d4|pc|s4|pc|sK|pg||
nt|flash: some still use 3NT as the forcing raise|pg||
