nt|petergill: Multi is not allowed in the Cavendish, but having a minimum is allowed|pg||
nt|petergill: Bas Drijver I suspect|pg||
nt|ritong: having a minimum = holding 13 cards?|pg||
nt|petergill: No, Sjoert Brink it is|pg||
nt|ahollan1: approximately 13 cards|pg||
nt|petergill: Dealer, fav vul = the time for action, is the Dutch style|pg||

nt|vugraphzjf: Drijver wants to play the hand again|pg||
nt|marlowepi: we all want second chances|pg||
mb|1C!|mb|2D!|nt|ritong: this hand might be more rewarding|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C=2+  [playing 1N=12-14]|pg||
nt|marlowepi: tricky showing majors with this shape|pg||
nt|marlowepi: so often what you need to be doing is bidding spades|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@C or 3@C or ?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: here of course np|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@C preemptive, perhaps?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: depends on agreements|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: 4@s looks like an easy make, assuming normal play|pg||
nt|marlowepi: np plausible scenario for failing|pg||

pc|h3|pc|h8|pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: without interference, 1@C-3@C = weak, 4@D & 5+@C  but i don't know if it can be this weak|pg||
