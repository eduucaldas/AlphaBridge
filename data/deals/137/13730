nt|farfie: oui,pour esperer refaire 120 imps en 32 donnes..;|pg||
nt|jcmax: We may not be able to find a convention card for EW yet, but they have played very successfully together for quite some time now. this year they have also qualified for the Swedish ...|pg||
nt|jcmax: Open team that will play in the European Championships in June.|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: sorry about the first board|pg||
nt|marlowepi: np|pg||
mb|2H|nt|petergill: so this is 2nd versus 4th|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ahollan1: 1@D=5+@D or 4441|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ahollan1: Bathurst currently 2nd with 71 VP, Diamond in 4th with 62|pg||
mb|4S|nt|jcmax: so, not unlikely these two pairs will meet soon again at the table.|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@D looks best, then 4@S 5@D perhaps|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: donc, ne soyez pas stupéfaits si vous voyez EO faire des trucs un peu erratiques|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: 4D would have a certain attraction if natural and suggesting a save|pg||
nt|petergill: west's @S9 will prevent South from double-finessing in trumps|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ritong: leur idée sera de créer des écarts par tous les moyens légaux|pg||

nt|ahollan1: :)  the bane of vugraph operator's world|pg||
nt|petergill: sorry, ignore me, I thought N had @SA|pg||
nt|marlowepi: all depends on agreeemnts, but on this deal it would be nice for 4D to propose a save |pg||
nt|petergill: in favour of 5@D - suitable vulnerability, |pg||
nt|petergill: against 5@D - @SKQ looks very good for defence |pg||
nt|marlowepi: George Mittelman suggests another possible agreement: X of 4S by the weak 2 bidder suggests interest in saving in Ds|pg||
nt|petergill: and Jeff Meckstroth's reputation for "always bidding 4@S, whether it's making or not" in order to coax a save out of East, makes the save in 5@D less clear|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ahollan1: Fallenius-Fredin bid this to 5@D|pg||

nt|jcmax: The layout in the @S-suit could hardly be better for the declaring side, so even though 3NT looks more appealing 5@D should make as well|pg||

nt|warrens:  ok, here's a hand with 7 honors onside!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what would you bid with west hand over opening 3@C?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: too good for preempt at this color scheme with establishable suit & outside ace|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: bien sage|pg||
nt|ahollan1: consider it a hypothetical question|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or -- actual case in other room|pg||
nt|petergill: Aside from being arguably the world's best player, Jeff Meckstoth is famous for upping the ante quickly, making opponents guess, so when he bids 4@s you are less sure that he has ...|pg||
nt|petergill: his bid. One dividend from this approach is that opponents misguess a lot. |pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4S|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: Demirev asking Zia what 3 Diamonds is and Zia shrugs shoulder|pg||
nt|marlowepi: over 3C i would bid 4S al|pg||
mb|4N|nt|ahollan1: what's the record?|pg||

nt|ritong: bretagne va donc dire 3@d|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: petite pause|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: bretagne revient|pg||
nt|ahollan1: diamond still in the tank -- i suspect 4@S would get most votes, but maybe DBL first|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: any guesses about 2@D?    a) only positive  b) 0-1 controls  c) other|pg||
mb|5H|nt|ritong: leenhardt sera d accord|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: 4@s chez françois je pense|pg||
nt|farfie: François devrait nommer la manche|pg||
nt|ahollan1: system summary for Welland-Willenkin is online from 2009 Team Trials, but it doesn't mention 1@S-2@C :(|pg||
nt|petergill: Thanks Al|pg||
nt|jcmax: I am guessing 0-1 controls, but we really don't know|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: long thinking by DeKnijff|pg||
nt|warrens:  oops, 6 only|pg||
mb|p|nt|po-s: I see seven too|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: Bathurst asking about leads and carding|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: on 20, Demirev sitting East bid 2@D over reopening DBL -- Multon playing 2@S from South|pg||
nt|petergill: with South on lead, finding the club ruff is not easy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and Diamond does start with DBL -- so much for predictions|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: i dont want to hear 5D|pg||
pc|c3|nt|farfie: parfait|pg||

nt|ahollan1: where 3@H=transfer  i've seen 3N used for specifically 2@S & 5@H -- but never this hand|pg||
nt|jcmax: Anybody bidding these cards to slam should be very proud. Bridge is not always a just game :)|pg||
nt|petergill: South is on lead, hence no lead-driecting dbl|pg||
nt|marlowepi: diamond's partner not allowed to bid diamonds?|pg||
nt|petergill: Great lead, suit pref @C3 to say I have @DA as an entry|pg||
nt|petergill: the reason not to lead @DA, as most players would woodenly do, is|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ritong: ça n a pas été necessaire, les adversaires sont allés a trois tout seuls|pg||

pc|c4|nt|ahollan1: FOUND IT --- "1C-1S, 1red-1N,1S-2C are ART GF relays, any distribution"|pg||

pc|d2|nt|ritong: mais c est un peu étrange de ne pas dire 3@d, deux bonnes cartes avec le part et neuf atouts connus|pg||
nt|ritong: vulnérable ou pas|pg||
nt|ritong: il me semble qu il etait tres legerement supérieur de jouer vers 108x|pg||
nt|ritong: a cause du 9 sec a gauche|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dA|nt|petergill: so you need more tricks to beat 5@H |pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ritong: mais c est juste instinctif|pg||
nt|ahollan1: I don't know Zagorin-Bathurst, but partnerships who allow choice of opening with 4@C & 4@D will often choose 1@D when @Sxx |pg||
nt|ahollan1: that way easy rebid if opponents bid @S and partner makes negative dbl|pg||
pc|cA|nt|petergill: 6@S is not a bad contract. I'm not sure if 6@S, 6NT or 3NT is the best contract to be in, based on 26 cards|pg||
pc|h9|pc|c2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not always?       when, if ever??|pg||
nt|petergill: hence you try the clubs, before the spade side suit you expect in dummy makes all the tricks|pg||

nt|petergill: 31-32 HCP with no fit didn't appeal to these world-class players for slam, but often appeals to lesser players|pg||
nt|petergill: and you should give a suit pref lead on opening lead, as you will not have much chance for a suit pref signal if partner wins @HA|pg||

nt|ahollan1: Brink-Drijver still young too|pg||
mb|2N|nt|petergill: with Michel Bessis's hand, I would stay out of the auction - when vulnerable, I don't like to bid bad suits in bad hands|pg||

nt|po-s: and they will play for Netherlands in this year´s European Chships|pg||

nt|vugraphzjd: lots of talking on both sides of screen explaining alerts|pg||

nt|petergill: A boring 3NT to catch my breath|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|farfie: j'ai tout faux:)|pg||
nt|jcmax: And 6@C would be no fun on a @D lead either. and realistically I would expect anyone to bid xxxx in @C with a 1S suit like that!|pg||

nt|davidstern: It may be dated but Brink Drijver's system card http://bridgefiles.net/pdf/2007-brink-driver.pdf|pg||
nt|jcmax: Declarer will most likely play for the @C A onside, ruff a @C in dummy, pitch a @D on a heart and hope for trumps 3-2. Easy game :)|pg||
nt|jcmax: That doesn't look like this year's teams to me yet, Al.|pg||
nt|davidstern: The VG matches are chosen live after the results are in so we are unable to tell you who will be next but it will usually involve the leading teams|pg||

nt|ahollan1: there's a Bridge Base Forum that lists the open team makeup for the European Championship|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: you might be tempted if you know a weak spot in opponents relay methods - but pass then bid in game forcing auction is huge risk|pg||

nt|petergill: attractive, to reduce the effectiveness of NS's auction |pg||
nt|petergill: and 2@H removes quite a bit of bidding space from NS|pg||

nt|jcmax: Declarer will probably try to ruff his @C loser before playing 3 rounds of trumps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm not sure why Team Brink not in running total -- or why 20 teams [i thought only 14 playing]|pg||
nt|davidstern: The results are wrong|pg||

nt|jcmax: This way if E happens to have a doubleton @C and 3 trumps, he will still make|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: he is still looking at all the hearts down comes the screen|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that is great explanation :)|pg||
nt|jcmax: If he drew 2 rounds of trumps before trying to ruff the @C e would overruf and there would be no entry to dummy's @H-winner|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: up screen|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: down screen again|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i was trying to work out possibilities if win @H then duck @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: delaying choice of discard on 3rd @H|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: up again now hearts still all showing at the table|pg||
nt|ahollan1: since it seems all lines require @CA onside|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: all cards now turned over|pg||
nt|jcmax: It seems to me the only time you can make this contract with the @CA offside is when W has KQ doubleton in @D. But you also have to play for it, and who would do that?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for specs who haven't played using screens -- the screen is lowered so that only one defender asks/answers questions without risking unauthorized info to the other defender|pg||

nt|petergill: yes, you might as well lead @D10, especially against weak players who might cover|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H=3-10 HCP, 5+@H|pg||
nt|jcmax: 2@H is probably the famous Muiderberg convention that is very popular in Holland|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: 4spades + Minor|pg||
nt|jcmax: Al knows better, he has a convention card .)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no mention in CC of 2@H being 2-suiter |pg||
nt|warrens:  once W had shown 6 @H's and 4@D's and hadn't led a stiff @C, he figured him for 3-6-4-0|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 3@C is some form of @S raise -- we just don't know the details :(|pg||
nt|warrens:  after all, leading a low @D from the Ace was a warning sign|pg||
nt|petergill: 2NT by who?|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: right -- the only issue in 6@D is whether to float @D10 or play @DQ anyway|pg||
nt|jcmax: N is now trying to find the right comfort level for the opponents|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think 2 passes to 2N|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: The transfer response allows the strong hand North to declarer the spades|pg||

pc|c5|pc|c6|nt|ahollan1: agree - no overcall here, but how close?  would change @Hx to @Dx be enough or need lots more opposite passed partner?|pg||
nt|warrens:  oh, a 6th @D makes it automatic.|pg||
nt|warrens:  after the ruff sluff in @D's, this will make because of the favorable @H position|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this set seems to be very declarer friendly|pg||
nt|po-s: of course North can drop HT to encourage declarer to run jack next|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: Thomas has his hands locked behind his head and staring at the dummy|pg||
nt|po-s: or nine rather|pg||
nt|warrens:  he's thinking about how to make with one spade loser and one heart loser|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 22  Zimmerman in North did not bid over 1@H opening -- later DBL convinced Multon to jump to 3@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: now one had covering his mouth|pg||
nt|ahollan1: where Bathurst struggled to make 2@S, Multon made 3@S after @H lead|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|petergill: the transfer response, just as Jacoby Transfers over 1NT do, also allows more space to bid sensibly|pg||
nt|petergill: Back on Bd 3 - it's hard to pass 4@H, because 4@D by East over 3@D would show both majors, not a strong hand with @H's - there are many hands where East bids 4@h and 6@h is cold. I ...|pg||
nt|petergill: blame NS for EW getting overboard, not blame E (just has a 4@H bid not a 3@H bid) nor W |pg||

nt|marlowepi: indeed a great player. it isnt a table-real context|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that could be David, i'm less than 100% confident about whether this set can have playback from session 1|pg||
nt|davidstern: My memory is aging and poor at best but I am pretty sure only tomorrow allows for playbacks|pg||
nt|davidstern: and only once|pg||
nt|petergill: club exit is normal, as South is expected to have @HA for the opening bid, and @HAK cannot run away|pg||
nt|marlowepi: bart gave me a zero at the table in Reno by seeing the problem without any probem being tipped. that impressed me|pg||

nt|ahollan1: this event converting IMPs to VPs using a true 30 VP scale   i.e. blitz = 30-0  whereas WBF scale max win is 25|pg||

nt|ahollan1: it was back when ACBL experimented with a PAUSE card -- much better than the always ignored STOP which is only sometimes used and only after a jump bid|pg||

nt|petergill: The first time I ever heard of Demirev was when he did some commentary here on BBO |pg||
nt|petergill: Good suit - of course Jeff Meckstroth overcalls|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@C must be 2+    and expect 1@H will be 4+@S|pg||

mb|1N!|nt|ritong: le chelem a @h est décent|pg||
nt|ritong: surtout de la main d ouest|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@D=5+@D or 4@D(441)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D denies 3+@H|pg||

nt|petergill: Agreeing with Al on matters of system is usually a good idea for us commentators|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|ahollan1: Sabine - do you think Wrang had any option other than 1@S?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: Wrang is pointing at 3 diamonds|pg||
nt|petergill: 1NT probably denies 3 spades|pg||
mb|d!|nt|ahollan1: gulp -- i was about to say ho-hum 2N-3N  and ask how they find slam when East minors reversed|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: Zia writing|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@D is artificial GF if they play the same methods as I do|pg||
nt|marlowepi: what about if they play the same methods that they do?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: now Demirev is writing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the 1N rebid is where 2 options arise -- in one camp 1N=strength of jump to 2N in the other [as appears here] 1N=2 of responder's suit and take the transfer = 3|pg||
nt|petergill: Sorry - we lack Convention Cards for these pairs. NS is not a regular partnership so they are playing basic Standard. |pg||
nt|ahollan1: or 2@D could be transfer|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: maintenant, son souci est l es atouts|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can they negotiate the @H ruff?   even looking at all 4 hands it takes a good eye to see the best defense|pg||
nt|petergill: EW have tried to transfer the declarer (of spades) to West, but have ended up wrongsiding the declarership of hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: Zia says don;t lead it my lead|pg||
nt|warrens:  makes 6@H by W but only 4 by E|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ahollan1: either way --singleton Ace and @Dxxxx makes it a iffy choice|pg||
nt|petergill: Meckstroth likes to play "reverse lead-directing doubles"|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|nt|warrens:  this is a horrible contract and deserves to go down.  needs 3-2 trump with the K onside, plus more help|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unless it is right -- then it is brilliant choice|pg||

nt|ahollan1: no @H - @H ruff means this will be fast hand |pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: I think over 50% of top experts would open South's hand 1@d in 3rd seat at this vulnerability. I certainly would|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes it is not good enough for 5D so 1D it is|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: wow -- everybody knew except me|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so the partnership needs to discuss East's 2nd actions of DBL, 2N and 3 new suit|pg||
pc|sT|pc|s6|nt|petergill: 1@D is good as a lead-directer, plenty of safety from the vulnerability, opposite a passed (North) hand EW are likely to have game on and 1@D makes it harder for EW to bid ...|pg||
nt|petergill: accurately|pg||
nt|marlowepi: excellent summary. plus if zia passed, there would be a UN enquiry|pg||
nt|petergill: Meckstroth never says "thanks you partner", even when he strikes a dummy as good as this one|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: 7-5, 3 aces, supporting quacks -- too right, 2@D would be very timid|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|petergill: No problem in finding the vital switch|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but absolute best response   "the older one is the dad"  :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: THAT lead could make things much easier|pg||
nt|po-s: how would yoy ever be able to catch back later otherwise?|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: on  8  Diamond playing 6@H west -- gets @H lead    oh my|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|ahollan1: i think declarer was stil going to get @H right -- as an avoidance play to protect @CK|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|ritong: mais piganeau ne crache pas sur la possibilité d un honneur sec en est|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h7|pc|hJ|nt|warrens:  I still doubt he'll make it.|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: je ne comprends pas de rejouer @h|pg||
nt|ritong: il semble naturel de jouer @c maintenant|pg||
nt|marlowepi: world-class players don;t get a lot of experience decidig which unforced moysian fit to play|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h8|nt|petergill: I think that the idea is that by saying "thank you partner" your tone might help the defenders estimate how happy you are with the contract, so they keep silent on all matters at ...|pg||
nt|petergill: the bridge table including that one|pg||
pc|h9|pc|c9|pg||
nt|ritong: et l affaire est pliée|pg||
nt|petergill: Thomas Bessis was one of the best juniors (Under 26) in the world until he turned 26 not that long ago|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can we rewind -- i want to see how auction goes if Welland tries 2@S|pg||
nt|petergill: Alex Smirnov at the other table is the same age as Thomas - mid to late 20's|pg||
nt|davidstern: 27 I think|pg||
nt|petergill: NS's ultra-bold bidding on Bd 7 gained 12 imps for their side|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Alex had great run in big Australian Team event this year -- he was old man with junior Aussies and New Zealand transplant teammates|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i dont know anyone who says thank you partner in live bridge|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s5|nt|petergill: Sorry, I stand corrected - Jeff has started regularly saying Thank You partner|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ahollan1: this is our last board of the session   next group of 3 9-board matches scheduled to begin in 1 hour 20 minutes|pg||
nt|warrens:  I don't understand why S played the @S K at trick one|pg||
nt|warrens:  but nothing matters much on this hand|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|davidstern: I am a big fan of Thomas Bessis' game. i watched him do some amazing things in San Remo |pg||
nt|davidstern: And wrote about them in the Bulletins|pg||
nt|ahollan1: there's a reason this hand is still being played -- i just don't know what it is|pg||
nt|ahollan1: too right Warren -- @SK seems like never-play [i.e. it can never be right[|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: I mayhave missed the first play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thanks again to our vugraph operator Debbie|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: sorry sometimes they don't show the cards played|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well - if she got trick 1 wrong, then i take away my thanks :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd:  I owe you a penny then|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but that would explain why no early claim when @D split 5-0|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: anyhow all bye for now will restart at 4 pm PDT|pg||
pc|hA|pc|cJ|nt|ahollan1: i was thinking @S finesse at trick one was best shot|pg||
nt|warrens:  ruff high and claim on 3-2 trumps?|pg||
nt|po-s: me too - don´t think he can - spade finesse would have made it|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ahollan1: Fallenius also in 6@D but De Wijs leads @D2|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the usual alutation is "is that all?"|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c6|pc|c3|pc|cA|pg||
nt|petergill: When Jeff Meckstroth was my screenmate in the World Championship in Beijing in 2008, and a very pleasant screenmate too, Jeff didn't say Thank You partner in that event|pg||
pc|s2|nt|petergill: 4@S is a save against 4@D, with the bonus that 4@s might make on lesser defence against weaker players than these|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|warrens:  I think E has to pitch now|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: he isnlooking at the jackof clubs|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ahollan1: good pitch -- now declarer taps himself|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for that reason, it seems that any black discard works|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|dK|nt|marlowepi: did he thank you at all?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|po-s: good def|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: Okayn will restart in about 10 minutes|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: maybe about 15 now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even better lead from De Wijs in other room|pg||
mc|7|nt|petergill: North and South are perhaps the two most famous players in the world - who hardly ever play together|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: Zia just said thank younguys|pg||
pg||
