mb|2C|nt|marlowepi: awkward for N|pg||
mb|2S|nt|petergill: Sam Lev and "Pepsi" sold for $35,000 in last night's auction|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: but 2C is the IMP bid|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in tempo crucial|pg||
nt|petergill: Good suit - get in there and bid it - seems to be the winningest philosophy at low levels|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|sA|nt|marlowepi: trying to hedge with neg dbl not advised when holding clubs & no diamond tolerance|pg||
nt|petergill: Even if this is not a good hand for that philosophy|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s2|pc|s3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: pay small, collect big. that is the mantra at IMPs|pg||
nt|petergill: Even If North passes the first time, he probably has to bid 3@C over 2@S anyway. |pg||
nt|petergill: EW are from France|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s9|pc|sT|nt|marlowepi: and if he neg dbls, S could go berserk in dimonds|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h2|pc|h5|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the north hand is why Eric Rodwell invented "Negative Free BIds"|pg||

pc|dT|pc|d4|nt|petergill: Jean Christophe Quantin and Marc Bompis are regulars in France's national team, but in this field they sold for the minimum price of $12,500|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|h6|nt|marlowepi: negative free bids are useful, but the flip side is having to double n many good hands and being preempted into awkward corners|pg||
nt|ahollan1: apparently the Germans playing those because Piekarek 2@C alerted and Smirnov never bid again|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h9|pc|hJ|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: pay small, reap big|pg||
nt|petergill: at IMPs, this is a good vulnerability to "go wrong" in the bidding|pg||
nt|petergill: and the players knew that when they bid|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: Auction results are in Friday's Bulletin at http://www.cavendishinvitational.com/2010/FRIBULL2010.pdf|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h3|pc|h2|pc|hA|pg||
pc|s4|nt|petergill: This very fast play means we will have a 5 to 10 minute break at this table after these 3 boards, waiting for the other tables to finish|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|pc|s2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Lev-Pepsi strong background in rubber bridge, where time=money |pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|pc|h5|pc|c2|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s7|pc|s5|pc|h4|pg||
nt|petergill: This play of the trump suit holds the trump losers to one, whereas leading a spade honour from dummy creates two trump losers. |pg||
pc|sJ|nt|marlowepi: hence the flex-time?|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s6|pc|h7|pg||
pc|d6|nt|petergill: The trump safety play gains when North has bare king or Kxxx in trumps|pg||
