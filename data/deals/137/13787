mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: that's a heavy favorable 2@S -- even 2nd seat|pg||
mb|p|pc|cQ|nt|petergill: -1, or -2 if @D's are misguessed|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N has a 1S opener in nomrla methods, but suspect they are playing 2-tiered 2 bids....2S 10-13 abd 2D multi? or the like|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|c8|pg||
nt|petergill: Aided by many successful finesses, EW make 5@D, and might make 5@C, I think|pg||
nt|marlowepi: S tables adequate support|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|nt|ahollan1: multi not allowed in Cavendish|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c4|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c9|pc|c3|nt|petergill: Still, not knowing about the winning finesses, it's normal for East o pass out 4@S. |pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|c7|pc|s4|pc|s6|pg||
pc|h4|nt|petergill: On the other hand, whenever you have a void in their suit, bidding on works out well far more often than one might expect.|pg||
nt|petergill: It's tempting to just cash out for 50|pg||
pc|hA|mc|9|nt|marlowepi: but if you know that, peter, it changes your expectations so that it works out well exactly as often as you expect|pg||
nt|petergill: I too would have played @HA |pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|nt|petergill: OK Marshall, that's true - I mean that 4NT on the East cards over 4@S is not unthinkable.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: clear 2S rebid|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d6|nt|vugraphzjf: FU says to Passell under the screen  "nice lead"|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ritong: this will go fast|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d8|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 16: With Q10xxxx and an ace and a single spade, partner would have bid 5@h 99% for sure over 4@S, but I and Drew Casen didn't want to risk that for an extra plus 50. |pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|pc|hJ|nt|ritong: a @h now, and passell has to play a @c|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c2|nt|petergill: Bd 16: For an extra 200 (if 4@s is doubled) we would have risked it|pg||

nt|marlowepi: will go fast, big heart heart to queen then sapde|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|petergill: East hand is worth 18.5 HCP on Kaplans Rubens evaluator ref http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=qj9+ak102+ak97+53|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|marlowepi: not my first wrong prediction. and i predict it wont be my last|pg||
pc|c2|pc|d3|pc|dK|pg||
nt|petergill: EW have done well to stop low - if East had a fitting club honour, 3NT might have been a great contract|pg||
nt|ritong: i have to admit that passell s instant pass was not expected|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not clear how they would ever get higher though|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cJ|nt|davidstern: Some lesser experienced players would consider tranferring to 3@C to play there|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but that still leaves you in a safe partial|pg||
nt|petergill: if East upgraded his hand to 18 HCP, perhaps putting North on lead to 3NT - and does 4@h have any play, I wonder?|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cQ|nt|ahollan1: or 1@D-1N//2N-?|pg||

mc|7|nt|petergill: Making a partscore should gain some imps for EW|pg||
nt|marlowepi: E has an upgradable hand for suit purposes, but he will probably be rebidding NT and for that strain he does not have real extras|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: closing and will restart soon there is still 7 minutes left in this round|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Levin also opened 1N|pg||
nt|ritong: of course|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and opening 1D could end him in 2N opposite five weak spades, with 2S an easy make after a 1n opener|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@D 1@H 4@H (or 3@H) is a possible auction, with West taking a view to respond in his 3 card major rather than respond 1NT|pg||
nt|ritong: cough|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if vul there would be more upside in the upgrade|pg||
nt|petergill: OK, so you guys like to bid normally, eh?|pg||
