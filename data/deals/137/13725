nt|vugraphzxr: 3@c?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS transfers over 1@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S = ART FG Relay|pg||
nt|petergill: 31-32 HCP with no fit didn't appeal to these world-class players for slam, but often appeals to lesser players|pg||
mb|2C!|mb|p|nt|petergill: with Michel Bessis's hand, I would stay out of the auction - when vulnerable, I don't like to bid bad suits in bad hands|pg||
nt|ahollan1: especially hard to diagnose slam in 5-2 fit without bypassing 3N [board 4]|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|petergill: but this father-son partnership from France has done very well indeed since joining the Zimmerman squad, so perhaps his action has more appeal than i realise|pg||

nt|vugraphzjd: lots of talking on both sides of screen explaining alerts|pg||
pc|h6|nt|farfie: j'ai tout faux:)|pg||
nt|jcmax: And 6@C would be no fun on a @D lead either. and realistically I would expect anyone to bid xxxx in @C with a 1S suit like that!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: results from Round 1 are online at http://www.cavendishinvitational.com/2010/TEAMS1-1S.htm|pg||
nt|davidstern: It may be dated but Brink Drijver's system card http://bridgefiles.net/pdf/2007-brink-driver.pdf|pg||
nt|jcmax: Declarer will most likely play for the @C A onside, ruff a @C in dummy, pitch a @D on a heart and hope for trumps 3-2. Easy game :)|pg||
nt|jcmax: That doesn't look like this year's teams to me yet, Al.|pg||
nt|davidstern: The VG matches are chosen live after the results are in so we are unable to tell you who will be next but it will usually involve the leading teams|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: Brink is pinching his nose and thinking hard|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h4|nt|ahollan1: you might be tempted if you know a weak spot in opponents relay methods - but pass then bid in game forcing auction is huge risk|pg||
nt|petergill: When the opponents had not yet disclosed their suits and were possibly heading slamwards using artificial methods, West rightly thought those conditions made intervention more ...|pg||
nt|petergill: attractive, to reduce the effectiveness of NS's auction |pg||
nt|petergill: and 2@H removes quite a bit of bidding space from NS|pg||
nt|petergill: I'm making quite a good case that Michel Bessis bids better than I do :)|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ahollan1: would have been interesting to see if relay could sniff out possible 6@C|pg||
nt|petergill: 6@C fares better than 6@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: there should be newer version on ecats bridge -- from Sao Paulo 2009 Bermuda Bowl|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|nt|ahollan1: even better if @C9 instead of @C8|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@h looks like a cue agreeing @d's|pg||
nt|petergill: Is there a case for leading @D10 and running it, in 6@D?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other than ....  it works?   :)|pg||

nt|ritong: en tout cas, dumazet ne semble pas déterminé a tirer sur tout ce qui bouge|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h5|nt|petergill: after the overcall has advertised long hearts and thus short diamonds in West?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: I apologize in advance by Welland|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|petergill: good lead! |pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: Thank you by Welland|pg||
nt|jcmax: Declarer will probably try to ruff his @C loser before playing 3 rounds of trumps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm not sure why Team Brink not in running total -- or why 20 teams [i thought only 14 playing]|pg||
nt|davidstern: The results are wrong|pg||
nt|davidstern: They refer to a prior year|pg||
nt|davidstern: I am having it fixed|pg||
nt|jcmax: This way if E happens to have a doubleton @C and 3 trumps, he will still make|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: he is still looking at all the hearts down comes the screen|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that is great explanation :)|pg||
nt|jcmax: If he drew 2 rounds of trumps before trying to ruff the @C e would overruf and there would be no entry to dummy's @H-winner|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: up screen|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: down screen again|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i was trying to work out possibilities if win @H then duck @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: delaying choice of discard on 3rd @H|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: up again now hearts still all showing at the table|pg||
nt|ahollan1: since it seems all lines require @CA onside|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: all cards now turned over|pg||
nt|jcmax: It seems to me the only time you can make this contract with the @CA offside is when W has KQ doubleton in @D. But you also have to play for it, and who would do that?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for specs who haven't played using screens -- the screen is lowered so that only one defender asks/answers questions without risking unauthorized info to the other defender|pg||
nt|davidstern: The theory is better than the reality of course|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cJ|nt|davidstern: One usually knows who is thinking and if there is some movement in terms of explanations on the other side|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i can't tell Sabine -- is that supporting my idea of duck @D at trick 2??|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|nt|ritong: mais tout ça est académique  onze plis|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s4|pg||
pc|s2|nt|petergill: the long weak heart suit, with no dbl of 4@h and no raise by partner, was unpromising as a source of tricks|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ahollan1: Roy [Welland] didn't see Peter's @D10 comment|pg||
nt|petergill: @DKx onside is more likely than @DKJx onside, hence the normal play by South|pg||

nt|petergill: 3@C might show hearts and 2@H show clubs, if they are into switching responder's bids when two suits have been bid |pg||
nt|ahollan1: and none of us saw THAT coming :(|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: moren writing on both sides of the screen|pg||
nt|davidstern: Migry was suggesting it to me|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|nt|ahollan1: enter and sign in please|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: ben, ils seront sans doute en situation de décider si ils sauvent une journée ou pas, c est triste pour eux|pg||
nt|davidstern: Welcome to Warren Spector|pg||
nt|warrens:  hi all.|pg||
mb|4D|nt|davidstern: Defence needs to get clubs going|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@D - to get the good four card support in - is normal among experts - 3@D is for wimps|pg||
nt|davidstern: Before declarer gets heart going|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidstern: I will take my leave to get ready for the next match and try and fix the webcam issue. Thanks for your company|pg||
nt|warrens:  looks like 3NT is the easiest game.  5@D a bid tougher|pg||
nt|ahollan1: do panelists rebid 3@D or 2@D holding void in responder's suit?|pg||
mb|4N!|nt|farfie: logique|pg||
nt|ritong: voila qui est fait|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: do either of you know -- which Bessis is dad, which is son?|pg||
nt|petergill: Interesting lead|pg||
nt|davidstern: Michel Dad Thomas Son|pg||
mb|5H!|nt|vugraphzxr: tout ça est bien joué:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: egalité a 420  bien vu Q|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: plutot normal de jouer la manche et de la filer je pense|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: enfin bien joué de la déclarer et après on voit|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: patrice devrait mettre un petit du mort|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: pour garder une remontée au mort |pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: qu est ce que vous en pensez|pg||
nt|ritong: méjane aura un tit souci sur le @s suivant, si ce n est pas l as|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: oui|pg||
nt|warrens:  Ivote for 3@D.  Lots of playing strength.|pg||
mb|5N!|mb|p|mb|6D|nt|ahollan1: wow -- everybody knew except me|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 7-5, 3 aces, supporting quacks -- too right, 2@D would be very timid|pg||
pc|s5|nt|petergill: No problem in finding the vital switch|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but absolute best response   "the older one is the dad"  :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: THAT lead could make things much easier|pg||
nt|po-s: how would yoy ever be able to catch back later otherwise?|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|pc|c7|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ritong: mais piganeau ne crache pas sur la possibilité d un honneur sec en est|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||
nt|warrens:  I still doubt he'll make it.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|vugraphzxr: je ne comprends pas de rejouer @h|pg||
nt|ritong: il semble naturel de jouer @c maintenant|pg||
pc|h9|pc|d3|pc|hT|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ritong: et l affaire est pliée|pg||
nt|petergill: Thomas Bessis was one of the best juniors (Under 26) in the world until he turned 26 not that long ago|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can we rewind -- i want to see how auction goes if Welland tries 2@S|pg||
nt|petergill: Alex Smirnov at the other table is the same age as Thomas - mid to late 20's|pg||
nt|davidstern: 27 I think|pg||
nt|petergill: NS's ultra-bold bidding on Bd 7 gained 12 imps for their side|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Alex had great run in big Australian Team event this year -- he was old man with junior Aussies and New Zealand transplant teammates|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cA|pc|c3|pg||
pc|h3|nt|davidstern: I am a big fan of Thomas Bessis' game. i watched him do some amazing things in San Remo |pg||
nt|davidstern: And wrote about them in the Bulletins|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|dK|nt|ahollan1: i was thinking @S finesse at trick one was best shot|pg||
nt|warrens:  ruff high and claim on 3-2 trumps?|pg||
nt|po-s: me too - don´t think he can - spade finesse would have made it|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Fallenius also in 6@D but De Wijs leads @D2|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s3|pc|d4|pc|s4|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hK|nt|petergill: 4@S is a save against 4@D, with the bonus that 4@s might make on lesser defence against weaker players than these|pg||
pc|d6|nt|warrens:  I think E has to pitch now|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: he isnlooking at the jackof clubs|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good pitch -- now declarer taps himself|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for that reason, it seems that any black discard works|pg||
pc|c4|pc|s7|mc|11|nt|po-s: good def|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: Okayn will restart in about 10 minutes|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: maybe about 15 now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: even better lead from De Wijs in other room|pg||
pg||
