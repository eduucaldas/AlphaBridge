mb|1S|nt|flash: E-W the leading Chinese pair|pg||
nt|flash: we'll see 2/1 of some ilk from N-S|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|flash: with a light-opening bid style, some have taken to playing 1NT as semi-forcing|pg||
pc|c2|nt|flash: North wouldn't accept any invitation and doesn't have a shapely hand, so he passes|pg||
nt|flash: Woolsey had (obviously) planned on a sequence to show a 3-card limit raise in @Ss|pg||

nt|royhughes: It isn't out of line at all by today's standards|pg||
mb|d|mb|4C|nt|flash: 4@C fit-showing jump|pg||
nt|royhughes: and it is a bit of a nuisance for Martel, who chooses an off-shape double|pg||
nt|royhughes: Yes, Fu shows his clubs to allow his partner to compete to the 5-level if appropriate|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|flash: over here, most would play that a 3@C call would be a lead director with @H tolerance|pg||
nt|royhughes: There is some advantage to that approach, but it does allow the opponents a bit more room|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|royhughes: Woolsey has been able to double 4cx|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|royhughes: which allows his partner to take appropriate action|pg||
pc|hK|nt|royhughes: I think Martel was happy to double with the AK of hearts|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h5|pc|hT|pg||
nt|royhughes: 4@s would have required a pickup of the spade suit, and EW might have found their diamond ruff|pg||
nt|flash: @S switch after the @Hs and nowhere to put the other losers?|pg||
nt|flash: Woolsey starting to show suit preference in the trump suit|pg||
nt|royhughes: Yes, a spade switch should get it 2 down|pg||
nt|flash: gotta watch those spots when they're 54   :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzje: next rd we will have Levin and Weinstein  vs    Fallenius and Fredin|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|nt|flash: Martel a bit reluctant to cede control here (by cashing the @HA)|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s8|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s7|nt|royhughes: Woolsey correctly inserted the 9|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|royhughes: If he had played the king, Zhao could have thrown away his club loser|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h6|pc|h4|pc|h8|pg||
nt|royhughes: Martel can kill dummy's spade threat, to end any chance of a black suit squeeze|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sJ|pc|sK|nt|flash: this round will take us 1/3 of the way through the session - a lot of bridge involved|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|pc|cA|pc|c9|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cJ|nt|royhughes: which maybe could never happen -- I'd need time to look at it|pg||

nt|royhughes: This was high-level bridge!|pg||
nt|royhughes: well-judged all around|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|royhughes: Fu chooses a marginal response and probably regrets it now|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|pc|d5|nt|royhughes: Martel's 8 of spades may be a 2nd trump trick -- Woolsey will probably cover the 9 if led from dummuy|pg||

pc|s9|pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|flash: upside-down count and attitude for N-S:  Woolsey shows 3 @Hs|pg||
nt|royhughes: It looks like NS play upside-down count|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hT|pc|h7|nt|royhughes: declarer may unblock the king here, creating a heart entry to dummy|pg||
nt|flash: Zhao considering whether a dummy entry will help|pg||
nt|royhughes: Then Martel would have to cash his club ace|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|flash: a @H exit still looks ok here|pg||
nt|royhughes: I don't know what is behind Woolseys heart 7|pg||
nt|royhughes: Yes, a diamond exit looks fine|pg||
nt|royhughes: I'm not sure what Martel was able to tell from the play of trick 1|pg||
