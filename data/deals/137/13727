mb|1N|nt|jcmax: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|flash: N-S playing some variation of French Std|pg||
nt|flash: E-W a club system|pg||
mb|p|nt|flash: (probably Meckwell Lite)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: Hi all David Stern Here - pls sit back and enjoy our presentation|pg||
mb|2H!|mb|p|nt|flash: last 9-board match of the session; back after break with 2nd session|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|nt|flash: hiya, David|pg||
nt|jcmax: With 16 hcp opposite a strong NT E knows he is at least in the slam zone.|pg||
nt|jcmax: He need s to find out whether his partner is minimum or maximum and whether there is a fit or not.|pg||
mb|4N|nt|flash: 4NT quantitative|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: West is certainly Max|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: if that is indeed the question|pg||
nt|flash: expecting partner to bid 6@S if accepting with 3-card @S support|pg||
nt|jcmax: His 4NT now after the transfer is a quantitative bid typically showing 5@S exactly, no second suit and asking partner to judge his hand|pg||
mb|p|mb|6N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzjf: Not high enough|pg||
nt|jcmax: If partner had a nice hand with no @S-fit and a 5-card suit somewhere he could show that now. and that way a 5-3 fit in another suit might be found|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: But moral victory vs 6@S at the other table +1470 here|pg||
nt|flash: the same 3-card support, however, makes 5 tricks in @Ss a favorite|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: Zimmerman making enquiries re Auction|pg||
nt|jcmax: I wonder why W chose to play in NT with 3-card support and a small doubleton 1D|pg||
nt|drewsky: weird choice of 6nt|pg||
nt|flash: welcome to Drew Casen|pg||
nt|jcmax: Hi Drew :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: This is the last match in Session1 the next session/match starts in 2:15 from now 16:00 PDS 19:00 New York 00:00 London 01:00 Europe and 09:00 Sydney|pg||

mb|2S|mb|p|nt|reisig: If you gonna bid ...try 2@h ...@s already known|pg||

nt|flash: welcome to Richie Reisig|pg||
nt|reisig: Hiya all :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: Hey Rich|pg||
nt|jcmax: Both E and W are entitled and sometimes even encouraged by the authorities to delay the bidding tray for some time by waiting to bid.|pg||
nt|jcmax: HI rich|pg||
nt|reisig: Hi Sabine:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|vugraphzjf: Nice little competitive auction. Bramley probably inspired by his lack of spade values|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|sJ|nt|jcmax: the reason being that preferable the players should not draw any inferences from the tempo of the auction.|pg||
nt|jcmax: But it's really all mainly theory. In practice it doesn't always work so well.|pg||
nt|flash: East's flat hand will provide no parking place for either of West's rounded-suit losers|pg||

nt|farfie: oui,pour esperer refaire 120 imps en 32 donnes..;|pg||
nt|jcmax: We may not be able to find a convention card for EW yet, but they have played very successfully together for quite some time now. this year they have also qualified for the Swedish ...|pg||
nt|jcmax: Open team that will play in the European Championships in June.|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@D=5+@D or 4441|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|nt|ritong: leur idée sera de créer des écarts par tous les moyens légaux|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the other room Demirev-Bramley start same way on board 19, but Demirev bid 6N|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcmax: No doubt N wishes he had had a bid to show both majors immediately over 1@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: you can spy on the other table using http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/ |pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: Zagorin keeps opening and closing his cards|pg||

mb|2D|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: wrang endplayed on opening lead|pg||
nt|jcmax: The layout in the @S-suit could hardly be better for the declaring side, so even though 3NT looks more appealing 5@D should make as well|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: ce qui est d ailleurs un exercice de style en soi|pg||

pc|d2|pg||
nt|jcmax: Very nice play by W here. But even if declarer had guessed wrong and played low in @S S would always get a 9th trick before the defence can get 5|pg||

nt|ahollan1: sorry -- Demirev WEST|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cT|pc|h7|pc|c6|pg||
nt|ritong: mais c est un peu étrange de ne pas dire 3@d, deux bonnes cartes avec le part et neuf atouts connus|pg||
nt|ritong: vulnérable ou pas|pg||
nt|ritong: il me semble qu il etait tres legerement supérieur de jouer vers 108x|pg||
nt|ritong: a cause du 9 sec a gauche|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d4|pc|dJ|pc|d3|pg||
nt|ritong: mais c est juste instinctif|pg||
nt|ahollan1: I don't know Zagorin-Bathurst, but partnerships who allow choice of opening with 4@C & 4@D will often choose 1@D when @Sxx |pg||
nt|ahollan1: that way easy rebid if opponents bid @S and partner makes negative dbl|pg||
pc|c3|nt|petergill: 6@S is not a bad contract. I'm not sure if 6@S, 6NT or 3NT is the best contract to be in, based on 26 cards|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|h8|nt|ahollan1: not always?       when, if ever??|pg||

pc|cA|pc|cQ|pc|c5|pc|h9|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in modern systems, 1@C frequently promises unbalanced hand or 5+@D|pg||
nt|warrens:  Bathurst is a young player, mid to late 20's, used to play with Justin Lall.  Very strong and aggressive|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ach --- modern treatment 1@C covers all balanced hands and 1@D unbal or 5+ depending upon agreement|pg||
nt|warrens:  Maybe someone can fill us in about Zagorin.|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzjf: But that said no explanation I can think of would fit the bill|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcmax: I can't help but think that there must be some kind of confusion involved. and Multon's jump to 3@S seems to confirm that|pg||
pc|h2|nt|vugraphzjf: Not a good lead for the defence|pg||
nt|flash: it would usually show values for a take-out X, but with enough @H length to have make it impractical earlier??|pg||

nt|vugraphzjf: Some French not so niceties being exchanged|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pg||

nt|petergill: 31-32 HCP with no fit didn't appeal to these world-class players for slam, but often appeals to lesser players|pg||
mb|p|nt|warrens:  this team: Zagorin-Bathurst & Brink-Drijver finished 3rd in last year's Reisinger|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Brink-Drijver still young too|pg||
mb|2S|nt|petergill: with Michel Bessis's hand, I would stay out of the auction - when vulnerable, I don't like to bid bad suits in bad hands|pg||
nt|ahollan1: especially hard to diagnose slam in 5-2 fit without bypassing 3N [board 4]|pg||
nt|po-s: and they will play for Netherlands in this year´s European Chships|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: but this father-son partnership from France has done very well indeed since joining the Zimmerman squad, so perhaps his action has more appeal than i realise|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=Drury|pg||

nt|farfie: j'ai tout faux:)|pg||
nt|jcmax: And 6@C would be no fun on a @D lead either. and realistically I would expect anyone to bid xxxx in @C with a 1S suit like that!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: results from Round 1 are online at http://www.cavendishinvitational.com/2010/TEAMS1-1S.htm|pg||
nt|davidstern: It may be dated but Brink Drijver's system card http://bridgefiles.net/pdf/2007-brink-driver.pdf|pg||
nt|jcmax: Declarer will most likely play for the @C A onside, ruff a @C in dummy, pitch a @D on a heart and hope for trumps 3-2. Easy game :)|pg||
nt|jcmax: That doesn't look like this year's teams to me yet, Al.|pg||
nt|davidstern: The VG matches are chosen live after the results are in so we are unable to tell you who will be next but it will usually involve the leading teams|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: Brink is pinching his nose and thinking hard|pg||
nt|ahollan1: there's a Bridge Base Forum that lists the open team makeup for the European Championship|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|nt|ahollan1: you might be tempted if you know a weak spot in opponents relay methods - but pass then bid in game forcing auction is huge risk|pg||
nt|petergill: When the opponents had not yet disclosed their suits and were possibly heading slamwards using artificial methods, West rightly thought those conditions made intervention more ...|pg||
nt|petergill: attractive, to reduce the effectiveness of NS's auction |pg||
nt|petergill: and 2@H removes quite a bit of bidding space from NS|pg||
nt|petergill: I'm making quite a good case that Michel Bessis bids better than I do :)|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: would have been interesting to see if relay could sniff out possible 6@C|pg||

nt|warrens:  looks like S wants to get to his hand to play a trump to the 10|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h4|nt|petergill: after the overcall has advertised long hearts and thus short diamonds in West?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: I apologize in advance by Welland|pg||
pc|h6|nt|petergill: good lead! |pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: Thank you by Welland|pg||
nt|jcmax: Declarer will probably try to ruff his @C loser before playing 3 rounds of trumps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm not sure why Team Brink not in running total -- or why 20 teams [i thought only 14 playing]|pg||
nt|davidstern: The results are wrong|pg||
nt|davidstern: They refer to a prior year|pg||
nt|davidstern: I am having it fixed|pg||
nt|jcmax: This way if E happens to have a doubleton @C and 3 trumps, he will still make|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: he is still looking at all the hearts down comes the screen|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that is great explanation :)|pg||
nt|jcmax: If he drew 2 rounds of trumps before trying to ruff the @C e would overruf and there would be no entry to dummy's @H-winner|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: up screen|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: down screen again|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i was trying to work out possibilities if win @H then duck @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: delaying choice of discard on 3rd @H|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: up again now hearts still all showing at the table|pg||
nt|ahollan1: since it seems all lines require @CA onside|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: all cards now turned over|pg||
nt|jcmax: It seems to me the only time you can make this contract with the @CA offside is when W has KQ doubleton in @D. But you also have to play for it, and who would do that?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for specs who haven't played using screens -- the screen is lowered so that only one defender asks/answers questions without risking unauthorized info to the other defender|pg||
nt|davidstern: The theory is better than the reality of course|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|dA|nt|davidstern: One usually knows who is thinking and if there is some movement in terms of explanations on the other side|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d5|nt|ahollan1: i can't tell Sabine -- is that supporting my idea of duck @D at trick 2??|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ritong: mais tout ça est académique  onze plis|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now that @H9 is good, doesn't look like West has any good options, but we know that defense can always generate 2nd trump trick|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c2|pc|s3|pg||
nt|petergill: the long weak heart suit, with no dbl of 4@h and no raise by partner, was unpromising as a source of tricks|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: Roy [Welland] didn't see Peter's @D10 comment|pg||
nt|petergill: @DKx onside is more likely than @DKJx onside, hence the normal play by South|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|pc|s7|pg||
pc|sT|nt|warrens:  yes, but declarer has to avoid playing a trump to the 10 or he's down on a club ruff|pg||

mb|4S|nt|reisig: 5@d at least|pg||
nt|reisig: I'd bid 6|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: Zimmerman has an easy 5@D but is probably troubled by holding 4 spades but he knows limited defensive values and likely void in spades in partner;s suit|pg||
nt|reisig: Pressure|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|jcmax: We have already seen that Multon isn't afraid of anything, so his 3NT bid now is really no big surprise. south at the other table passed.|pg||

nt|vugraphzjf: Zimmerman nodding his head in admiration on seeing dummy and thanks partner|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: Yes I would not like to be in 5@S for your money so double for -1 well judged|pg||
nt|reisig: He thinks - there's a play for this|pg||
nt|jcmax: 5@S really has no realistic play. It made at the other table, because N led a @D and continued with another @D into the double void|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: thereby allowing a losing club to be pitched but even then lots of work|pg||

nt|petergill: The lead won a lot of imps for EW|pg||

nt|vugraphzjd: Brink shows 5 fingers to Wrang|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: non, mais pas grave|pg||
nt|farfie: 5 perdantes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H=4+@S|pg||
nt|petergill: yes, you might as well lead @D10, especially against weak players who might cover|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H=3-10 HCP, 5+@H|pg||
nt|jcmax: 2@H is probably the famous Muiderberg convention that is very popular in Holland|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: 4spades + Minor|pg||
nt|jcmax: Al knows better, he has a convention card .)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no mention in CC of 2@H being 2-suiter |pg||
nt|warrens:  once W had shown 6 @H's and 4@D's and hadn't led a stiff @C, he figured him for 3-6-4-0|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|ahollan1: 3@C is some form of @S raise -- we just don't know the details :(|pg||
nt|warrens:  after all, leading a low @D from the Ace was a warning sign|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|ahollan1: right -- the only issue in 6@D is whether to float @D10 or play @DQ anyway|pg||
nt|jcmax: N is now trying to find the right comfort level for the opponents|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: The transfer response allows the strong hand North to declarer the spades|pg||
nt|jcmax: From his point of view slam rates to be cold for them and they might even make a grand slam.|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: which might be advantageous on this layout |pg||
nt|petergill: by dodging the @D lead|pg||

pc|c4|pg||
pc|s4|pc|d5|nt|ahollan1: agree - no overcall here, but how close?  would change @Hx to @Dx be enough or need lots more opposite passed partner?|pg||
nt|warrens:  oh, a 6th @D makes it automatic.|pg||
nt|warrens:  after the ruff sluff in @D's, this will make because of the favorable @H position|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this set seems to be very declarer friendly|pg||
nt|po-s: of course North can drop HT to encourage declarer to run jack next|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: Thomas has his hands locked behind his head and staring at the dummy|pg||
nt|po-s: or nine rather|pg||
nt|warrens:  he's thinking about how to make with one spade loser and one heart loser|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 22  Zimmerman in North did not bid over 1@H opening -- later DBL convinced Multon to jump to 3@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: now one had covering his mouth|pg||
nt|ahollan1: where Bathurst struggled to make 2@S, Multon made 3@S after @H lead|pg||
pc|sA|nt|petergill: the transfer response, just as Jacoby Transfers over 1NT do, also allows more space to bid sensibly|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|ritong: je n ai aucun commentaire pertinent a proposer|pg||

nt|ritong: dommage pour le spectacle|pg||
nt|jcmax: Tks for the company all, it was fun. I am moving over to the open room. c u later.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good question from spec -- was Wrang @H9 suit preference?    makes a lot of sense to use it that way|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and foolish me -- only wondered about North action over 1@S, never considered SOUTH bidding|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzxr: x me semble mieux que 2@h question de style peut êre|pg||
mb|1S|nt|petergill: Maybe East should have doubled, on reflection|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Open Room EW, Piekarek-Smirnov play Baltic Club -- they're convention card should be online somewhere one ecats|pg||
nt|davidstern: 5@C N/S |pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|davidstern: E/W dont have anything of interest|pg||
nt|davidstern: Yes of course 3NT but only with the fortunate heart position - I would prefer 5@C at teams|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|petergill: More ultra-aggressive bidding by NS|pg||
nt|petergill: Will Thomas bid 5@h or Pass?|pg||
nt|petergill: 5@H seems to be one level too high|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't think enough shape to pull - but it is close|pg||
nt|ahollan1: show of hands -- how many remember when North hand never thought of any bid but PASS|pg||
nt|warrens:  yes, I like S bidding, especially as a passed hand.  should be -1 in 5@D, assuming good defense |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: obviously that DBL was NOT Responsive, but some form of Rosenkranz [showing @C honor]|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: tiens, il cherche la baston|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: Drijver lays down 10 tricks of cards|pg||

nt|petergill: West would expect East to have a singleton spade|pg||

nt|ahollan1: surely not enough shape for WELLAND to bid 5@H :)|pg||

nt|davidstern: Any questions about the tournament or venue etc.|pg||
nt|davidstern: How can life be it's Las Vegas|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this event converting IMPs to VPs using a true 30 VP scale   i.e. blitz = 30-0  whereas WBF scale max win is 25|pg||
nt|davidstern: And the scale is very compressed|pg||
pc|s8|pg||

pc|s4|nt|jcmax: If East had no values in @H at all showing the minors could very easily have been the winning action|pg||
pc|s5|pc|h9|pc|sK|pg||
nt|jcmax: But unfortunately over a 2NT opening there isn't so much room to investigate.|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: or fortunately as the case may be|pg||

nt|ahollan1: with 3@H make Support DBL|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Sabine - do you think Wrang had any option other than 1@S?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: Wrang is pointing at 3 diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: gulp -- i was about to say ho-hum 2N-3N  and ask how they find slam when East minors reversed|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ritong: car toutes les entames arrangent le déclarant|pg||

nt|davidstern: If B/D havent changed system their 1NT is : 1NT Openings: 9-12 1st Fav, 15-17 o/wise|pg||

nt|vugraphzjd: screen down and not Michel is asking|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|nt|ritong: maintenant, son souci est l es atouts|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can they negotiate the @H ruff?   even looking at all 4 hands it takes a good eye to see the best defense|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: either way --singleton Ace and @Dxxxx makes it a iffy choice|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|d4|nt|warrens:  this is a horrible contract and deserves to go down.  needs 3-2 trump with the K onside, plus more help|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unless it is right -- then it is brilliant choice|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ahollan1: no @H - @H ruff means this will be fast hand |pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pg||
nt|ritong: ici, lasserre a fortement suggéré @s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm told specifically 5@C 4@D slammish|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ritong: et le singleton est connu|pg||
nt|ritong: puisqu il a reparlé sur 4@h|pg||
pc|s8|nt|vugraphzxr: cette donne sera surement une egalité|pg||

pc|cA|nt|ritong: donc le poizillon aurait pu trouver l entame de la dame de @s, pour le fun|pg||
nt|ritong: hm|pg||

pc|c3|nt|ritong: si c est le cas, ça ne sera surement pas apres la meme sequence|pg||

nt|ahollan1: especially with trump entry to dummy [22 trump or singleton @S10]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: at least i don't think that they are a well established partnership|pg||
mb|1S|mb|1N|nt|davidstern: Only 8 tricks N/S in NT and 4@D for E/W|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 6 was 300 (2SX) to 200 (4@S -4) as we expected = 3 imps|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: Roy pulls out 2 spades bid and pputs back|pg||
nt|petergill: 2 and a half spades perhaps?|pg||
nt|davidstern: 2.275|pg||
nt|ahollan1: some pairs use 2N as spade raise -- that would work well here with in-between hand|pg||
nt|davidstern: IMHO|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: now bids 3 clubs and is writing to Thomas|pg||
nt|petergill: or 3@D? or Dbl? Not 3@s which is weak |pg||
nt|ahollan1: I sort of like 2@S  intending to bid 3@H given the opportunity|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe that brings DBL into Welland's options|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzxr: non c est sr il sait qu il est a moins l infini pas cool au moment d aller faire les points|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: meyer stretz c est leur deuxieme finale perdue|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|ritong: en tout cas il y songe|pg||
nt|davidstern: Apparently 3@C is a transfer to 3@D|pg||
nt|davidstern: which is cue raise|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@C might show hearts and 2@H show clubs, if they are into switching responder's bids when two suits have been bid |pg||
nt|ahollan1: and none of us saw THAT coming :(|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: moren writing on both sides of the screen|pg||
nt|davidstern: Migry was suggesting it to me|pg||
mb|2S|nt|ahollan1: now P-P-3@C//P-3N ??|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: enter and sign in please|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or maybe DBL now|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: ben, ils seront sans doute en situation de décider si ils sauvent une journée ou pas, c est triste pour eux|pg||
nt|davidstern: Welcome to Warren Spector|pg||
nt|warrens:  hi all.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i thought DBL was a reach -- hence my 1st guess|pg||
nt|warrens:  is 3@C forcing? |pg||
mb|3N|nt|davidstern: Defence needs to get clubs going|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@D - to get the good four card support in - is normal among experts - 3@D is for wimps|pg||
nt|davidstern: Before declarer gets heart going|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidstern: I will take my leave to get ready for the next match and try and fix the webcam issue. Thanks for your company|pg||
nt|warrens:  looks like 3NT is the easiest game.  5@D a bid tougher|pg||
nt|ahollan1: do panelists rebid 3@D or 2@D holding void in responder's suit?|pg||
mb|p|nt|farfie: logique|pg||
nt|ritong: voila qui est fait|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: do either of you know -- which Bessis is dad, which is son?|pg||
nt|petergill: Interesting lead|pg||
nt|davidstern: Michel Dad Thomas Son|pg||
nt|warrens:  certainly not everyone plays it so|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good / tough question Warren    what IS the default?|pg||
pc|s9|nt|vugraphzxr: tout ça est bien joué:)|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ritong: egalité a 420  bien vu Q|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: plutot normal de jouer la manche et de la filer je pense|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: enfin bien joué de la déclarer et après on voit|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: patrice devrait mettre un petit du mort|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: pour garder une remontée au mort |pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: qu est ce que vous en pensez|pg||
nt|ritong: méjane aura un tit souci sur le @s suivant, si ce n est pas l as|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: oui|pg||
nt|warrens:  Ivote for 3@D.  Lots of playing strength.|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ahollan1: wow -- everybody knew except me|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so the partnership needs to discuss East's 2nd actions of DBL, 2N and 3 new suit|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 7-5, 3 aces, supporting quacks -- too right, 2@D would be very timid|pg||
pc|h3|nt|petergill: No problem in finding the vital switch|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but absolute best response   "the older one is the dad"  :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: THAT lead could make things much easier|pg||
nt|po-s: how would yoy ever be able to catch back later otherwise?|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think declarer was stil going to get @H right -- as an avoidance play to protect @CK|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ritong: mais piganeau ne crache pas sur la possibilité d un honneur sec en est|pg||
pc|s4|pc|dK|pc|d3|pg||

pc|h5|nt|vugraphzxr: je ne comprends pas de rejouer @h|pg||

pc|hT|pc|hQ|pc|s3|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ritong: et l affaire est pliée|pg||
nt|petergill: Thomas Bessis was one of the best juniors (Under 26) in the world until he turned 26 not that long ago|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can we rewind -- i want to see how auction goes if Welland tries 2@S|pg||
nt|petergill: Alex Smirnov at the other table is the same age as Thomas - mid to late 20's|pg||
nt|davidstern: 27 I think|pg||
nt|petergill: NS's ultra-bold bidding on Bd 7 gained 12 imps for their side|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Alex had great run in big Australian Team event this year -- he was old man with junior Aussies and New Zealand transplant teammates|pg||
pc|s5|pc|c4|pc|c7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is our last board of the session   next group of 3 9-board matches scheduled to begin in 1 hour 20 minutes|pg||
nt|warrens:  I don't understand why S played the @S K at trick one|pg||
nt|warrens:  but nothing matters much on this hand|pg||
mc|11|nt|davidstern: I am a big fan of Thomas Bessis' game. i watched him do some amazing things in San Remo |pg||
nt|davidstern: And wrote about them in the Bulletins|pg||
nt|ahollan1: there's a reason this hand is still being played -- i just don't know what it is|pg||
nt|ahollan1: too right Warren -- @SK seems like never-play [i.e. it can never be right[|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: I mayhave missed the first play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thanks again to our vugraph operator Debbie|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: sorry sometimes they don't show the cards played|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well - if she got trick 1 wrong, then i take away my thanks :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd:  I owe you a penny then|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but that would explain why no early claim when @D split 5-0|pg||
