nt|vugraphzje: ok ready to go everyone here|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C!|mb|p|nt|flash: it's a heavy tariff for a form of scoring which is far from everyone's favorite|pg||
mb|1N|nt|flash: West is Perry Johnson|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3C|nt|flash: it's officially an invitational event, but it would be most unusual for a world-class player to be turned away|pg||
mb|p|nt|poohbear: 1C strong and I believe 1NT is a @c positive ( 5 or more @cs 8 or more points)|pg||
nt|flash: if you check the web site, you'll see the form used to 'request an invitation'|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|mb|4D!|nt|poohbear: 4@d RKCB|pg||
mb|d|nt|flash: RM Precision most likely for E-W|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|r|mb|p|nt|dburn:  the trouble with all this is that West will now play a club slam with a diamond lead|pg||
mb|4H|mb|d|nt|flash: pls check the Daily Bulletin for auction prices - i believe the auction page on the web site is an obsolete link|pg||
nt|flash: welcome to David Burn!!!|pg||
nt|dburn:  hello|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|nt|rgdruru: hello|pg||
nt|dburn:  and the trouble with all that is that West can't make a club slam with a diamond lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|d6|nt|dburn:  fortunately (in a sense) East can't make a club slam with a spade lead either, so others may be going down also|pg||
nt|poohbear: In a Std auction West opens 1@s and rebids 2@c over 1NT  now what does East do?|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|dburn:  if 3@h were to show shortage with club support East could do that|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|d2|pg||
mc|11|pg||
qx|o8|st||md|2S83H7DKT8653CT985,SAJT7HAK9862D7CJ6,SKQ654HQT43DCAQ32,S92HJ5DAQJ942CK74|sv|o|nt|poohbear: big IF :)|pg||
nt|dburn:  a little unlucky, perhaps, but not as unlucky as those who reach 6@c by East and find they can't make it|pg||
mb|1H|mb|1S|mb|2D!|an|GF|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|d|mb|r|nt|dburn:  slight overbid, that force to game considering what you are supposed to open in the Meckwell style|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|dburn:  but Jeff has said that faced with a choice between an overbid and an underbid as an initial action, it's better to overbid|pg||
nt|flash: given the alert, i'm not at all sure is GF, David|pg||
pc|sK|nt|dburn:  well, given the pass to 3@h maybe 2@d wasn't actually forcing at all|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s8|pc|sA|pg||
pc|hA|nt|poohbear: I am surprised Johnson didnt dbl 2@s|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h5|pc|h7|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|pc|hJ|pc|cT|pg||
nt|vugraphzje: Ok i read what east wrote 2 d NF up to inv|pg||
nt|flash: thnx, Catalina  :)|pg||
nt|flash: so 'negative free bids' for E-W|pg||
nt|vugraphzje: misheard what west said srry about that|pg||
pc|d7|pc|c3|nt|poohbear: Very hard for the VG operators to see the notes players are writing to each other. Some players are helpful . Most aren't|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|vugraphzje: yeah very hard|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|h2|pc|s5|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pc|s9|pc|s3|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|nt|flash: now North can use his high trumps, but with the @CA on-side, this was always makable|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c6|pg||
mc|9|pg||
qx|o9|st||md|3SAQ5HKQJ8DATCAK53,S3HA732DKJ76CQJ92,SKJ764HT64DQ85CT8,ST982H95D9432C764|sv|e|mb|p|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|flash: 2@C strong, artificial and forcing; a positive response usually requires a slightly better suit than North holds|pg||
mb|3H|nt|flash: now an xfer|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|dburn:  rare to see any response other than 2@d these days anyway|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|flash: unless the pair is playing an immediate 2@H as dbl negative (or showing controls)   :)|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cQ|nt|flash: 4@C a control bid in support of @Ss|pg||
pc|c8|nt|flash: no 12th trick?|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cA|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s4|pc|s2|pg||
nt|dburn:  some play that South's 3@s promises three cards, and bid 3NT with a doubleton spade|pg||
pc|sQ|mc|11|nt|dburn:  not sure whether this pair have that arrangement|pg||
nt|flash: the pitch on the long @H comes in the wrong hand...   always a @D loser|pg||
nt|vugraphzje: ok people, will reopen soon, next coming  bompis quantin   vs   L Ecuyer and krekorian|pg||
nt|flash: again, for security reasons, we'll be closing both tables before the next round starts|pg||
