mb|2C!|nt|jcmax: so, not unlikely these two pairs will meet soon again at the table.|pg||

nt|petergill: west's @S9 will prevent South from double-finessing in trumps|pg||

nt|ahollan1: in the other room Demirev-Bramley start same way on board 19, but Demirev bid 6N|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: :)  the bane of vugraph operator's world|pg||
nt|petergill: sorry, ignore me, I thought N had @SA|pg||
nt|marlowepi: all depends on agreeemnts, but on this deal it would be nice for 4D to propose a save |pg||
nt|petergill: in favour of 5@D - suitable vulnerability, |pg||
nt|petergill: against 5@D - @SKQ looks very good for defence |pg||
nt|marlowepi: George Mittelman suggests another possible agreement: X of 4S by the weak 2 bidder suggests interest in saving in Ds|pg||
nt|petergill: and Jeff Meckstroth's reputation for "always bidding 4@S, whether it's making or not" in order to coax a save out of East, makes the save in 5@D less clear|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@D any minimum|pg||

nt|ahollan1: consider it a hypothetical question|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or -- actual case in other room|pg||
nt|petergill: Aside from being arguably the world's best player, Jeff Meckstoth is famous for upping the ante quickly, making opponents guess, so when he bids 4@s you are less sure that he has ...|pg||
nt|petergill: his bid. One dividend from this approach is that opponents misguess a lot. |pg||

mb|3S|nt|ahollan1: on 20, Demirev sitting East bid 2@D over reopening DBL -- Multon playing 2@S from South|pg||
nt|petergill: with South on lead, finding the club ruff is not easy|pg||

pc|hK|nt|ahollan1: FOUND IT --- "1C-1S, 1red-1N,1S-2C are ART GF relays, any distribution"|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|h2|pc|h4|nt|ritong: mais c est un peu étrange de ne pas dire 3@d, deux bonnes cartes avec le part et neuf atouts connus|pg||

pc|h6|pg||
pc|c4|nt|petergill: so you need more tricks to beat 5@H |pg||
pc|cT|pc|cA|nt|ritong: mais c est juste instinctif|pg||
nt|ahollan1: I don't know Zagorin-Bathurst, but partnerships who allow choice of opening with 4@C & 4@D will often choose 1@D when @Sxx |pg||
nt|ahollan1: that way easy rebid if opponents bid @S and partner makes negative dbl|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|petergill: 6@S is not a bad contract. I'm not sure if 6@S, 6NT or 3NT is the best contract to be in, based on 26 cards|pg||
nt|petergill: or pehaps in 6@C one might play for the person with the 3rd trump to have 3+ @d's, by drawing 2 rounds of trumps then playing diamonds, ruffing the 4th @D if possible|pg||
nt|petergill: My info about the Dutch pairs is confirmed by specs|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: not always?       when, if ever??|pg||

nt|ahollan1: wow -- in other room the auction went   3@C-DBL-P-4@H//P-4@S-end|pg||
nt|petergill: that was a truly great lead by Zia|pg||
mb|1N|nt|warrens:  this team: Zagorin-Bathurst & Brink-Drijver finished 3rd in last year's Reisinger|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Brink-Drijver still young too|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: with Michel Bessis's hand, I would stay out of the auction - when vulnerable, I don't like to bid bad suits in bad hands|pg||
nt|ahollan1: especially hard to diagnose slam in 5-2 fit without bypassing 3N [board 4]|pg||
nt|po-s: and they will play for Netherlands in this year´s European Chships|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and yes, they won the event|pg||
nt|petergill: The controversy is that Fantoni - Nunes have been omitted from Italy's team, in order to put Bocchi - Madala in the team|pg||
mb|3N|nt|petergill: but this father-son partnership from France has done very well indeed since joining the Zimmerman squad, so perhaps his action has more appeal than i realise|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=Drury|pg||

nt|vugraphzjd: lots of talking on both sides of screen explaining alerts|pg||

nt|petergill: A boring 3NT to catch my breath|pg||
pc|s9|nt|farfie: j'ai tout faux:)|pg||
nt|jcmax: And 6@C would be no fun on a @D lead either. and realistically I would expect anyone to bid xxxx in @C with a 1S suit like that!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: results from Round 1 are online at http://www.cavendishinvitational.com/2010/TEAMS1-1S.htm|pg||
nt|davidstern: It may be dated but Brink Drijver's system card http://bridgefiles.net/pdf/2007-brink-driver.pdf|pg||
nt|jcmax: Declarer will most likely play for the @C A onside, ruff a @C in dummy, pitch a @D on a heart and hope for trumps 3-2. Easy game :)|pg||
nt|jcmax: That doesn't look like this year's teams to me yet, Al.|pg||
nt|davidstern: The VG matches are chosen live after the results are in so we are unable to tell you who will be next but it will usually involve the leading teams|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: Brink is pinching his nose and thinking hard|pg||
nt|ahollan1: there's a Bridge Base Forum that lists the open team makeup for the European Championship|pg||
nt|petergill: Almost all (or most?) experts open the very strong South hand 1@H, not 2@C, so that the hand can be bid accurately, without losing bidding space. |pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: sorry John I made a mistake|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think 4@D = Grant Baze covention -- showing BALANCED raise to 4@S|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: you might be tempted if you know a weak spot in opponents relay methods - but pass then bid in game forcing auction is huge risk|pg||
nt|petergill: When the opponents had not yet disclosed their suits and were possibly heading slamwards using artificial methods, West rightly thought those conditions made intervention more ...|pg||
nt|petergill: attractive, to reduce the effectiveness of NS's auction |pg||
nt|petergill: and 2@H removes quite a bit of bidding space from NS|pg||
nt|petergill: I'm making quite a good case that Michel Bessis bids better than I do :)|pg||
pc|d7|nt|marlowepi: breathe through gills|pg||

nt|vugraphzjd: I apologize in advance by Welland|pg||
pc|c4|nt|petergill: good lead! |pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: Thank you by Welland|pg||
nt|jcmax: Declarer will probably try to ruff his @C loser before playing 3 rounds of trumps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm not sure why Team Brink not in running total -- or why 20 teams [i thought only 14 playing]|pg||
nt|davidstern: The results are wrong|pg||
nt|davidstern: They refer to a prior year|pg||
nt|davidstern: I am having it fixed|pg||
nt|jcmax: This way if E happens to have a doubleton @C and 3 trumps, he will still make|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: he is still looking at all the hearts down comes the screen|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that is great explanation :)|pg||
nt|jcmax: If he drew 2 rounds of trumps before trying to ruff the @C e would overruf and there would be no entry to dummy's @H-winner|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: up screen|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: down screen again|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i was trying to work out possibilities if win @H then duck @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: delaying choice of discard on 3rd @H|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: up again now hearts still all showing at the table|pg||
nt|ahollan1: since it seems all lines require @CA onside|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: all cards now turned over|pg||
nt|jcmax: It seems to me the only time you can make this contract with the @CA offside is when W has KQ doubleton in @D. But you also have to play for it, and who would do that?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for specs who haven't played using screens -- the screen is lowered so that only one defender asks/answers questions without risking unauthorized info to the other defender|pg||
nt|davidstern: The theory is better than the reality of course|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|h2|pg||
nt|ritong: mais tout ça est académique  onze plis|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now that @H9 is good, doesn't look like West has any good options, but we know that defense can always generate 2nd trump trick|pg||
nt|petergill: To read why, you go to that thread, then follow the links from its 2nd page to the Neapolitan Club website, which has comments from many Italians on the situation.|pg||
pc|h5|nt|petergill: I agree with Al|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hA|nt|petergill: the long weak heart suit, with no dbl of 4@h and no raise by partner, was unpromising as a source of tricks|pg||
pc|h3|pg||

nt|ahollan1: no mention in CC of 2@H being 2-suiter |pg||

mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 3@C is some form of @S raise -- we just don't know the details :(|pg||
nt|warrens:  after all, leading a low @D from the Ace was a warning sign|pg||

nt|ahollan1: 1@C is forcing, but includes minimum balanced hands|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: right -- the only issue in 6@D is whether to float @D10 or play @DQ anyway|pg||

nt|warrens:  oh, a 6th @D makes it automatic.|pg||
nt|warrens:  after the ruff sluff in @D's, this will make because of the favorable @H position|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this set seems to be very declarer friendly|pg||

nt|vugraphzjd: Thomas has his hands locked behind his head and staring at the dummy|pg||
nt|po-s: or nine rather|pg||
nt|warrens:  he's thinking about how to make with one spade loser and one heart loser|pg||

nt|ahollan1: where Bathurst struggled to make 2@S, Multon made 3@S after @H lead|pg||

nt|petergill: the transfer response, just as Jacoby Transfers over 1NT do, also allows more space to bid sensibly|pg||
nt|petergill: Back on Bd 3 - it's hard to pass 4@H, because 4@D by East over 3@D would show both majors, not a strong hand with @H's - there are many hands where East bids 4@h and 6@h is cold. I ...|pg||

nt|warrens:  another aggressive game that rates to make.|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: Dbl might show 4+ hearts|pg||
nt|petergill: At the other table, Woolsey's Dbl of a vulnerable Helgemo showed a lack of faith in Helgemo - still, Helgemo did buy a lucky dummy|pg||
nt|davidstern: Tough on South here|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@C Stayman|pg||
mb|2N|nt|ahollan1: thanks to spectator who provides Michael's quote "always play a nine on defense ... unless you have to"|pg||
nt|davidstern: Well done by Bertens|pg||
nt|petergill: Kit Woolsey's second Dbl might have been in part to avoid partner going on to 5@S on some layouts|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|warrens:  either W leads a black card, give declarer the contract, or he gets squeezed in the black suits in the endgame|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: c est une position confortable  on a le droit de perdre 10 swings de double partielle|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@C "asks distribution"    not sure how that differes from Stayman|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: guessing 1N alert = @C|pg||
nt|petergill: so a flat board|pg||
nt|petergill: 1NT looks like a transfer to clubs |pg||
mb|p|pc|h4|nt|petergill: South is not far from bidding 3@s, but there's (almost) no need to overbid at all when Jeff Meckstroth is opposite you. Jeff will never miss a game.|pg||

nt|petergill: EW lead 3rd and 5th versus suits|pg||
pc|h6|nt|warrens:  "giving declarer..."|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: attitude leads|pg||
pc|hA|nt|petergill: Much the same here - the Dbl was partly intended to stop partner going to 5@S. |pg||
nt|ahollan1: a truly vindictive Bridge God would have @H split 4-0 -- or @CA @C ruff|pg||
nt|petergill: The Wests are wrong when South has a 9 card suit, but right most of the rest of the time. And how likely is "two 9 card @h suits in one match"?|pg||

pc|h2|pc|hQ|pc|h5|pc|h3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS  upside down count & attitude -- no mention of Smith Echoes [but wouldn't apply here anyway]|pg||
nt|petergill: Opposite a 1NT overcall, it's best to push in the bidding, as Lev did, because 1NT bidder's high cards lie over the opener's high cards, and 1NT bidder knows who has the missing ...|pg||
nt|petergill: high cards, making a light game playable|pg||
nt|petergill: Sorry, Sam Lev started in Poland then in Israel then in USA, I am told. |pg||
nt|petergill: Both East and North will find the play difficult|pg||
pc|d3|nt|petergill: Perhaps West, with well placed @D's, didn't want to dbl with his stiff king, in case it helped declarer|pg||
nt|ahollan1: premature save against 3N?  how does EW do in that contract|pg||
nt|petergill: West had already downgraded his bare king a lot|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|d4|pg||

pc|d6|pc|h7|nt|petergill: North ducks the 2nd @D, in part to avoid being on play|pg||

nt|marlowepi: or to your demirev|pg||

nt|vugraphzxr: pourquoi un @h?|pg||

nt|ahollan1: and foolish me -- only wondered about North action over 1@S, never considered SOUTH bidding|pg||
nt|ahollan1: it either happens or it doesn't|pg||

nt|davidstern: 5@C N/S |pg||
nt|petergill: 3NT on a spade lead might be hard to make|pg||

nt|petergill: was held in 1998 in Lille, France. |pg||
nt|ahollan1: this set reminds me of my days playing rubber bridge -- sitting EW|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think peter means aprc ontest|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidstern: E/W dont have anything of interest|pg||
nt|davidstern: Yes of course 3NT but only with the fortunate heart position - I would prefer 5@C at teams|pg||
nt|marlowepi: par contest|pg||
nt|petergill: Yes I do|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3D|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: Dbl would be 4/4 in majors|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: the club exit would have prevented the 2nd endplay - sorry about my misanalysis - if I could analyse better, I would be playing in Las Vegas right now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Peter mentioned East known as Pepsi -- but didn't mention that North is known as "Bus"|pg||
pc|c5|nt|petergill: More ultra-aggressive bidding by NS|pg||
nt|petergill: Will Thomas bid 5@h or Pass?|pg||
nt|petergill: 5@H seems to be one level too high|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't think enough shape to pull - but it is close|pg||
nt|ahollan1: show of hands -- how many remember when North hand never thought of any bid but PASS|pg||
nt|warrens:  yes, I like S bidding, especially as a passed hand.  should be -1 in 5@D, assuming good defense |pg||
pc|cA|nt|ahollan1: obviously that DBL was NOT Responsive, but some form of Rosenkranz [showing @C honor]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i've always suspected that invitational 1m-2N is the least sensible agreement in modern bridge|pg||

nt|marlowepi: this might not be that great for EW|pg||
nt|davidstern: Likely only -1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Bus Driver ....  honest|pg||
pc|s3|nt|farfie: oui,drole d'idée|pg||
nt|petergill: West would expect East to have a singleton spade|pg||
nt|petergill: on this bidding|pg||
nt|ahollan1: surely not enough shape for WELLAND to bid 5@H :)|pg||
nt|petergill: need to change to 5@H by West|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is 4th of 9 9-board matches split into 3 sets of 3 matches|pg||
nt|davidstern: 2-1-1-0|pg||
nt|davidstern: The last three matches do allow for replay of a match played today|pg||
nt|ahollan1: there can be playback of teams, but not within a given 3 match session|pg||
nt|petergill: 5 @C plus 2@S and 2 aces to knock out - you need to knock out South's ace first, but then can the defence plays @Hs?|pg||
nt|petergill: At the other table, East played @D10 from dummy and North rose @DA in case partner had @SAJ10xx and no @HA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wouldn't @SK be better shot than @SJ?|pg||
nt|petergill: That was clever of East to foresee that the defence might do that|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: screen down|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: now up|pg||
nt|petergill: @SK at Trick 1, then @SJ at Trick 2, would clarify the spade position for North|pg||
nt|petergill: but seems a bit double dummy to me. |pg||
nt|ahollan1: i suppose @SJ hoping that partner holds @SA and declarer @SQx(x)|pg||
nt|petergill: On other alyouts - If partner had Ax in spades, @SK lead might wreck the defence if EW have lots of minor suit tricks|pg||
pc|sK|nt|vugraphzxr: piganeau a alerté d appel|pg||

nt|petergill: world is a greater achievement to my eyes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry David -- you got there first|pg||
nt|davidstern: It is my understanding which may be wrong that the playback can only happen tomorrow during sessions 7-9|pg||
nt|petergill: @DJ (to deny @DQ) or 1D9 (suit pref to avoid a @H switch).  |pg||
nt|petergill: @D9|pg||
pc|s2|nt|petergill: This will drift down one|pg||

nt|ahollan1: i was thinking that North unlikely to hold an ace - so try @SK hoping dummy has stiff Q|pg||
pc|c7|nt|petergill: Not clear which you should play|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well it is arguable. it means that when you know there is a complex problem on the hand you are excellent at spotting it and solving it. with no disrespect at all to Bart, who is ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: indeed a great player. it isnt a table-real context|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that could be David, i'm less than 100% confident about whether this set can have playback from session 1|pg||
nt|davidstern: My memory is aging and poor at best but I am pretty sure only tomorrow allows for playbacks|pg||
nt|davidstern: and only once|pg||
nt|petergill: club exit is normal, as South is expected to have @HA for the opening bid, and @HAK cannot run away|pg||
nt|marlowepi: bart gave me a zero at the table in Reno by seeing the problem without any probem being tipped. that impressed me|pg||
nt|petergill: @C4 exit makes it harder for South to count the hand out|pg||

nt|ahollan1: this event converting IMPs to VPs using a true 30 VP scale   i.e. blitz = 30-0  whereas WBF scale max win is 25|pg||

nt|petergill: Pepsi's Dbl was important - it's good to get into the bidding when you can, and not worry too much about having only three small in spades|pg||
pc|s5|nt|petergill: if the latter, South can hope that East has doubleton @SA|pg||

nt|vugraphzjd: now Demirev is writing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the 1N rebid is where 2 options arise -- in one camp 1N=strength of jump to 2N in the other [as appears here] 1N=2 of responder's suit and take the transfer = 3|pg||
nt|petergill: Sorry - we lack Convention Cards for these pairs. NS is not a regular partnership so they are playing basic Standard. |pg||
nt|ahollan1: or 2@D could be transfer|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: car toutes les entames arrangent le déclarant|pg||
nt|ritong: avanti|pg||

nt|petergill: play for penalties|pg||
nt|davidstern: If B/D havent changed system their 1NT is : 1NT Openings: 9-12 1st Fav, 15-17 o/wise|pg||
nt|davidstern: Just so you understand the scoring 13 IMPS is 23-7|pg||

pc|sT|nt|vugraphzjd: screen down by Wrang|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or minors with better @C??|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: screen down and not Michel is asking|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2 only @H supports Peter's guess that 2@D is 2-way Checkback|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|ritong: maintenant, son souci est l es atouts|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can they negotiate the @H ruff?   even looking at all 4 hands it takes a good eye to see the best defense|pg||
nt|petergill: EW have tried to transfer the declarer (of spades) to West, but have ended up wrongsiding the declarership of hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: Zia says don;t lead it my lead|pg||
nt|warrens:  makes 6@H by W but only 4 by E|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@S relay, so that 4@h on 4333 opposite 4333 can be avoided in favour of 3NT|pg||
nt|petergill: the relay also allows more accurate slam bidding|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe downgrade hand and 2@C was only path to Inivite  ---  or opportunity to see cool treatment of 2@S|pg||
nt|petergill: West's singleton heart and @SA has encouraged him to go for the jugular (= blood)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: single dummy this actually has some chance of overtrick|pg||
nt|petergill: For anyone looking at MOVIE of Bd 24: On Bd 24, there is an error in the transcribing - on @D10, dummy pitched a heart, not a spade|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ahollan1: either way --singleton Ace and @Dxxxx makes it a iffy choice|pg||
nt|petergill: Meckstroth likes to play "reverse lead-directing doubles"|pg||
nt|petergill: Club or spade lead is best, but surely a @d lead is most likely in real life|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cK|nt|warrens:  this is a horrible contract and deserves to go down.  needs 3-2 trump with the K onside, plus more help|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unless it is right -- then it is brilliant choice|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|ahollan1: no @H - @H ruff means this will be fast hand |pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|nt|ritong: ici, lasserre a fortement suggéré @s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm told specifically 5@C 4@D slammish|pg||
nt|petergill: EW knew that they had wrongsided @Hs so they had to stop in 4@H|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ritong: et le singleton est connu|pg||
nt|ritong: puisqu il a reparlé sur 4@h|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: cette donne sera surement une egalité|pg||
nt|petergill: they can see only 13 cards when they lead. We can see 52. |pg||
nt|ritong: i can tell you michel bessis is grumbling inside|pg||
nt|ahollan1: depends upon which glasses being used|pg||
pc|s3|nt|petergill: wrongsided @Ds I mean|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ahollan1: i've heard them called  "anti-lead directing doubles"  but "reverse" fits well too|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ritong: donc le poizillon aurait pu trouver l entame de la dame de @s, pour le fun|pg||
nt|ritong: hm|pg||
nt|warrens:  I agree that xxxx @D does not make for a slam try|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|ritong: si c est le cas, ça ne sera surement pas apres la meme sequence|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: :)|pg||
nt|davidstern: Claim 5 and next hand methinks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: specs may think this is just overtricks, but the VP scale in use is very compressed so that overtricks DO matter here|pg||
nt|petergill: Scores after 3 rounds at http://www.cavendishinvitational.com/2010/TEAMS1-1S.htm|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: hard to imagine that Demirev-Bramley will have or use that tool|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ahollan1: well then of course declarer can counteract -- but i hadn't thought about that |pg||
nt|petergill: there are 9 rounds - this is Round 4|pg||
nt|petergill: The Double of 1@S had more going for it if he was on lead, to lead his heart - partner's trump lead is impeccable against a doubled partscore, in theory (though not in practice as ...|pg||

pc|cQ|pc|c7|pc|d4|pc|d5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: basically this is problem since early days -- RDBL with good hand, then opponent's bid suit where you hold 3 and no good suit -- all choices distasteful|pg||

mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|ritong: zhao might envisage some smolen variation|pg||

nt|ritong: suppose you play standard smolen|pg||
nt|ritong: and this occurs?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: 15 min warning|pg||
nt|flash: given the favorable position of the red Jacks, this can always be made|pg||

nt|ritong: encore une main de stayman|pg||
nt|ritong: musclée, cette fois|pg||
nt|ritong: leenhardt pourrait imposer la manche|pg||
nt|ahollan1: especially with trump entry to dummy [22 trump or singleton @S10]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: at least i don't think that they are a well established partnership|pg||
nt|petergill: Club shift more or less places West with @CK, so perhaps the "heart before @D" play could have been found|pg||
nt|petergill: West's greedy Double was perhaps influenced by his rubber bridge activities in which taking penalties from unwary vulnerable takeout doublers is a favourite for most experts |pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|davidstern: Only 8 tricks N/S in NT and 4@D for E/W|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 6 was 300 (2SX) to 200 (4@S -4) as we expected = 3 imps|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: Roy pulls out 2 spades bid and pputs back|pg||
nt|petergill: 2 and a half spades perhaps?|pg||
nt|davidstern: 2.275|pg||
nt|ahollan1: some pairs use 2N as spade raise -- that would work well here with in-between hand|pg||
nt|davidstern: IMHO|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: now bids 3 clubs and is writing to Thomas|pg||
nt|petergill: or 3@D? or Dbl? Not 3@s which is weak |pg||
nt|ahollan1: I sort of like 2@S  intending to bid 3@H given the opportunity|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe that brings DBL into Welland's options|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: This is the last board of the day|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=15-17, not 5@H/@S|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|vugraphzxr: non c est sr il sait qu il est a moins l infini pas cool au moment d aller faire les points|pg||

nt|marlowepi: 1D|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: en tout cas il y songe|pg||
nt|davidstern: Apparently 3@C is a transfer to 3@D|pg||
nt|davidstern: which is cue raise|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@C might show hearts and 2@H show clubs, if they are into switching responder's bids when two suits have been bid |pg||
nt|ahollan1: and none of us saw THAT coming :(|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: moren writing on both sides of the screen|pg||
nt|davidstern: Migry was suggesting it to me|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Diamond will open West hand on  8 1N [14-16]   I suspect he'll declare @H also|pg||
nt|petergill: The most recent thread about Jeff Meckstroth on BBO Forums (discussion group) is http://forums.bridgebase.com/index.php?showtopic=38901|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C alert because does not promise a 4-card major|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|ahollan1: now P-P-3@C//P-3N ??|pg||
nt|marlowepi: advantage of not playing precision, u can open 1D here and have it be worthwhile|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: enter and sign in please|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or maybe DBL now|pg||
nt|petergill: Directly to 4@S in case EW can make something, or slowly to explore our best spot? I think North has done it right|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|ritong: ben, ils seront sans doute en situation de décider si ils sauvent une journée ou pas, c est triste pour eux|pg||
nt|davidstern: Welcome to Warren Spector|pg||
nt|warrens:  hi all.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i thought DBL was a reach -- hence my 1st guess|pg||
nt|warrens:  is 3@C forcing? |pg||
nt|petergill: We will see two more 9 board matches tonight after this one|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidstern: Defence needs to get clubs going|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@D - to get the good four card support in - is normal among experts - 3@D is for wimps|pg||
nt|davidstern: Before declarer gets heart going|pg||
nt|petergill: Zia has a near maximum for 1D :)|pg||
nt|petergill: I am kidding|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@d negative|pg||
nt|ahollan1: last board of the set -- 1 more 9-board match tonight then 3 tomorrow|pg||
nt|ahollan1: side note: initial transfers for NS only promise 4|pg||
mb|3S|nt|davidstern: I will take my leave to get ready for the next match and try and fix the webcam issue. Thanks for your company|pg||
nt|warrens:  looks like 3NT is the easiest game.  5@D a bid tougher|pg||
nt|ahollan1: do panelists rebid 3@D or 2@D holding void in responder's suit?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: after all these hands -- we don't even know if 1@C is always strong or  2-way [ala Baltic Club] and one-round force|pg||
nt|petergill: in the webcam at the bottom of http://www.cavendishinvitational.com, |pg||
nt|petergill: Thomas Bessis is the young French guy to the left of the screen, and the silvery haired guy to the right of the screen is John Mohan|pg||
mb|p|nt|farfie: logique|pg||
nt|ritong: voila qui est fait|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ahollan1: do either of you know -- which Bessis is dad, which is son?|pg||
nt|petergill: Interesting lead|pg||
nt|davidstern: Michel Dad Thomas Son|pg||
nt|warrens:  certainly not everyone plays it so|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good / tough question Warren    what IS the default?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzxr: tout ça est bien joué:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: egalité a 420  bien vu Q|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: plutot normal de jouer la manche et de la filer je pense|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: enfin bien joué de la déclarer et après on voit|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: patrice devrait mettre un petit du mort|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: pour garder une remontée au mort |pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: qu est ce que vous en pensez|pg||
nt|ritong: méjane aura un tit souci sur le @s suivant, si ce n est pas l as|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: oui|pg||
nt|warrens:  Ivote for 3@D.  Lots of playing strength.|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: If NS have a 4-4 heart fit, I think the spade suit quality is not robust enough to make spades better than hearts. |pg||
pc|sA|nt|petergill: I think over 50% of top experts would open South's hand 1@d in 3rd seat at this vulnerability. I certainly would|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes it is not good enough for 5D so 1D it is|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not positive but next set usually 15-20 minutes after match ends|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ahollan1: wow -- everybody knew except me|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so the partnership needs to discuss East's 2nd actions of DBL, 2N and 3 new suit|pg||
nt|petergill: South is Huub Bertens from Netherlands|pg||
nt|ritong: bertens/bakkeren won the pairs event not so long ago|pg||
nt|petergill: It's not clear that this is a singleton - running the @d is possible|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@D is good as a lead-directer, plenty of safety from the vulnerability, opposite a passed (North) hand EW are likely to have game on and 1@D makes it harder for EW to bid ...|pg||
nt|petergill: accurately|pg||
nt|marlowepi: excellent summary. plus if zia passed, there would be a UN enquiry|pg||
nt|petergill: Meckstroth never says "thanks you partner", even when he strikes a dummy as good as this one|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 25, where we talked about Pepsi double of 2@H with @Sxxx --- Zhao took phantom save to 10@H [5@HX]|pg||
nt|petergill: On Bd 8, NS can just, but only just, beat 3NT, so minus 160 might be close to a flat board, instead of the disaster it looks like. |pg||
nt|petergill: On Bd 26 I mean|pg||
nt|petergill: Mahaffey won this event narrowly last year, with a big win in the last match|pg||
nt|petergill: First prize is $43,000|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ahollan1: 7-5, 3 aces, supporting quacks -- too right, 2@D would be very timid|pg||
pc|c5|nt|petergill: No problem in finding the vital switch|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but absolute best response   "the older one is the dad"  :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: THAT lead could make things much easier|pg||
nt|po-s: how would yoy ever be able to catch back later otherwise?|pg||
pc|c2|nt|petergill: with North having a weak hand on the bidding, leading away from a king is possible|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  8  Diamond playing 6@H west -- gets @H lead    oh my|pg||
nt|petergill: Webcam is at the bottom of http://www.cavendishinvitational.com|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3 matches starting tomorrow morning 10:30 Las Vegas time -- then the evening is spent bidding on pairs for the main event|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ahollan1: i think declarer was stil going to get @H right -- as an avoidance play to protect @CK|pg||

nt|marlowepi: world-class players don;t get a lot of experience decidig which unforced moysian fit to play|pg||
pc|d9|pc|c6|pg||
nt|petergill: I think that the idea is that by saying "thank you partner" your tone might help the defenders estimate how happy you are with the contract, so they keep silent on all matters at ...|pg||
nt|petergill: the bridge table including that one|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c4|nt|ritong: et l affaire est pliée|pg||
nt|petergill: Thomas Bessis was one of the best juniors (Under 26) in the world until he turned 26 not that long ago|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can we rewind -- i want to see how auction goes if Welland tries 2@S|pg||
nt|petergill: Alex Smirnov at the other table is the same age as Thomas - mid to late 20's|pg||
nt|davidstern: 27 I think|pg||
nt|petergill: NS's ultra-bold bidding on Bd 7 gained 12 imps for their side|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Alex had great run in big Australian Team event this year -- he was old man with junior Aussies and New Zealand transplant teammates|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i dont know anyone who says thank you partner in live bridge|pg||
pc|s8|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|petergill: Sorry, I stand corrected - Jeff has started regularly saying Thank You partner|pg||
pc|h6|nt|ahollan1: this is our last board of the session   next group of 3 9-board matches scheduled to begin in 1 hour 20 minutes|pg||
nt|warrens:  I don't understand why S played the @S K at trick one|pg||
nt|warrens:  but nothing matters much on this hand|pg||
nt|petergill: still, that was the normal start to the play|pg||
pc|h4|nt|davidstern: I am a big fan of Thomas Bessis' game. i watched him do some amazing things in San Remo |pg||
nt|davidstern: And wrote about them in the Bulletins|pg||
nt|ahollan1: there's a reason this hand is still being played -- i just don't know what it is|pg||
nt|ahollan1: too right Warren -- @SK seems like never-play [i.e. it can never be right[|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: I mayhave missed the first play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thanks again to our vugraph operator Debbie|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: sorry sometimes they don't show the cards played|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well - if she got trick 1 wrong, then i take away my thanks :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd:  I owe you a penny then|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but that would explain why no early claim when @D split 5-0|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: anyhow all bye for now will restart at 4 pm PDT|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i was thinking @S finesse at trick one was best shot|pg||
nt|warrens:  ruff high and claim on 3-2 trumps?|pg||
nt|po-s: me too - don´t think he can - spade finesse would have made it|pg||
nt|petergill: with Bas Drijver, the Dutch guy aged about 30, on the right of the screen|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: Fallenius also in 6@D but De Wijs leads @D2|pg||
pc|hT|nt|marlowepi: the usual alutation is "is that all?"|pg||
nt|petergill: "Loser on loser" play to disrupt defence's communication if West had @CA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: assuming 2@S alerted because lebenohl situation -- 3@H seems a bit of a push  [spec asked about alert]|pg||
nt|petergill: @D2 at Trick 1 would have been natural count - that is how most French players signal|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|petergill: pitching a @d from dummy looks normal, but declarer doesn't know the spade position|pg||
nt|petergill: I think he is wondering whether to ruff with the ace|pg||
nt|petergill: Earlier: best was to cash @CA, then low heart for ruff with @SA, then @d ruff|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: Thomas and Huub are laughing at each other|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|petergill: this is a fascinating hand to defend|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d7|nt|petergill: When Jeff Meckstroth was my screenmate in the World Championship in Beijing in 2008, and a very pleasant screenmate too, Jeff didn't say Thank You partner in that event|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|petergill: 4@S is a save against 4@D, with the bonus that 4@s might make on lesser defence against weaker players than these|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|warrens:  I think E has to pitch now|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: he isnlooking at the jackof clubs|pg||
mc|10|nt|ahollan1: good pitch -- now declarer taps himself|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for that reason, it seems that any black discard works|pg||
nt|petergill: Total prizemoney for this 3 session Teams  - warmup for the main event - is about US$90,000|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: Play starts tomorrow at 10:30 PDT|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: Thanks for BBO and all the people who bring you the opportunity of watching great bridge|pg||
