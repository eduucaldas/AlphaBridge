mb|p|pc|c3|nt|brolucius: It's absolutely fine if you just need to understand something, rather than get a smooth translation.|pg||
nt|flash: unfortunately for Diamond, it was Meckstroth on lead, not Zia, vs 3NT...|pg||
nt|jcmax: I wonder whether N's delayed 2@S bid may carry any intereferences as to suit quality and a possible 2nd suit.|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cA|pc|c8|pg||
nt|brolucius: On the other table, they bid and made 3NT on the deal that had a flat 19-count facing an ace.|pg||
nt|jcmax: It's not like bidding 2@S at this point was any safer than directly over 1NT. E was still unlimited.|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cQ|pc|c2|pc|cK|pg||
pc|s3|nt|brolucius: That's right, but I suppose it is psychologically different because you are nervoud of allowing 2@H to play when you may have a spade fit.|pg||
nt|jbgood: good point, David|pg||
nt|jcmax: I understand, but on the other hand it will make it so much easier for the opponents to double you now, when they may have had no means to do so before.|pg||
nt|jcmax: At the other table N bid directly over 1NT|pg||
nt|flash: ducking is the winning play here|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|pc|s5|pg||
nt|jcmax: W is no doubt trying to figure out whether it can be right to go up with the Ace in case partner has only a doubleton @S|pg||
nt|brolucius: The defenders may expect North to hold only five spades because he did not speak on the first round.|pg||
nt|jcmax: N will probably continue a @D now.|pg||
nt|jcmax: the if W tries to give partner a @C ruff, N can pitch his @H-loser|pg||
nt|jcmax: So W would do best to switch to a @H|pg||
nt|flash: yes - by threatening to ruff a @D in dummy, declarer might get the defense to play trumps?|pg||
nt|flash: but a @D to the Ten will pretty much expose the lay-out|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s7|pc|sT|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|brolucius: It would be interesting at this point to know what was going through Helness's brain. It does seem tempting to play a diamond now. He has to do something with the suit at some ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: time. Ah, a spade!|pg||
nt|flash: now, as Sabine indicated, West has to get a @H on the table before surrendering the lead|pg||

nt|vugraphzjd: sorry about the first board|pg||
nt|marlowepi: np|pg||
nt|jcmax: At the other table W bid 3@S instead of 2@S. now N couldn't show his @H and there never was any temptation to bid to the 5-level|pg||
nt|ahollan1: another potential preempt on this board|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: so this is 2nd versus 4th|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: strong|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but i thought it was going to be from Bathurst :)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: 1@D=5+@D or 4441|pg||
nt|jcmax: Why is there no result entered for board 1?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: strong as in ACOL 2s??  wow|pg||
nt|ahollan1: they've had good showings recently in Europe too -- and if not mistaken Australia|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|ahollan1: Bathurst currently 2nd with 71 VP, Diamond in 4th with 62|pg||
nt|petergill: Sjoert Brink and Bas Drijver are in the 2010 Dutch National team. |pg||
nt|jcmax: I believe W would really like to splinter in 1C to make any higher level decision easier. But he may be afraid it promises a bit more.|pg||
mb|2H|nt|jcmax: so, not unlikely these two pairs will meet soon again at the table.|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@D looks best, then 4@S 5@D perhaps|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Meckwell over 1N   2@D=@D + @H or @S|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: Zia says diamond and spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: donc, ne soyez pas stupéfaits si vous voyez EO faire des trucs un peu erratiques|pg||
nt|petergill: "6/5 come alive" is a saying that experts seem to live by|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: trying to fix resullts from board 1|pg||
nt|petergill: and in Japan's NEC Cup in February where Lavazza pipped them in the Grand Final|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Helness overcalled 1@D with North hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder if he said that before of after the 2@H bid :)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|marlowepi: 4D would have a certain attraction if natural and suggesting a save|pg||
nt|petergill: west's @S9 will prevent South from double-finessing in trumps|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: leur idée sera de créer des écarts par tous les moyens légaux|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the other room Demirev-Bramley start same way on board 19, but Demirev bid 6N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room  1@H-(2@S)-4@H-end|pg||
nt|jcmax: And of course in their system 4@C may not be a splinter at all anyway.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: multi-taskers can spy on the other room using http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/ |pg||
mb|p|nt|jcmax: No doubt N wishes he had had a bid to show both majors immediately over 1@D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: you can spy on the other table using http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/ |pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: Zagorin keeps opening and closing his cards|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the problem with 3D is E cant know how strong W is|pg||
nt|petergill: The EW father -son pair also won a European Championship in Antalya, Turkey and a World Chmpionship in Shanghai in 2007, I think|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=ART Game Force|pg||

pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: :)  the bane of vugraph operator's world|pg||
nt|petergill: sorry, ignore me, I thought N had @SA|pg||
nt|marlowepi: all depends on agreeemnts, but on this deal it would be nice for 4D to propose a save |pg||
nt|petergill: in favour of 5@D - suitable vulnerability, |pg||
nt|petergill: against 5@D - @SKQ looks very good for defence |pg||
nt|marlowepi: George Mittelman suggests another possible agreement: X of 4S by the weak 2 bidder suggests interest in saving in Ds|pg||
nt|petergill: and Jeff Meckstroth's reputation for "always bidding 4@S, whether it's making or not" in order to coax a save out of East, makes the save in 5@D less clear|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@D any minimum|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ahollan1: Fallenius-Fredin bid this to 5@D|pg||

nt|ahollan1: wrang endplayed on opening lead|pg||
nt|jcmax: The layout in the @S-suit could hardly be better for the declaring side, so even though 3NT looks more appealing 5@D should make as well|pg||
nt|ahollan1: same contract via very different routes|pg||
nt|petergill: I think that Bocchi - Madala's good effort in that NEC Cup win might have contributed to Italy promoting that pair over Fantunes into this year's Italy national team.|pg||

nt|ahollan1: claim early, claim often|pg||
nt|jcmax: Hi Peter|pg||
mb|1D|nt|jcmax: A 1@S opening after my own heart :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: voyons si piganeau utilise le stayman|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: je ne vois vraiment l'équipe piganeau reperdre autant de points ils ont fait une partie très solide dans l'ensemble|pg||
nt|farfie: 9 levées à 3sa,10 levees à 4 @s..|pg||
nt|petergill: Al -a quick quiz question - in the WBF World Bridge Rankings, who's the top-rated American player outside the Nickell team?|pg||
nt|petergill: Exactly - Kevin Bathurst chooses to open at the one level - the modern style is that favourable vulnerability preempts in 1st seat are weaker than this South hand|pg||
mb|1S|nt|vugraphzxr: un stayman suivi de 2@s?|pg||
nt|ritong: oui, j aime bien|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i like 1C|pg||
nt|jcmax: N has 2 artificial bids available. 3@C and 3@D|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: writing by zagorin to Michel|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Helgemo seems to have read that book too -- exact same start to auction with East about to bid 4@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|farfie: moi aussi|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 2: Helness's Pass at the other table surprises me - I think Welland deserved that swing|pg||
nt|warrens:  ok, here's a hand with 7 honors onside!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: what would you bid with west hand over opening 3@C?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: too good for preempt at this color scheme with establishable suit & outside ace|pg||
nt|jcmax: Many pairs play in this position that 3@C shows a forcing @H-bid|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ritong: bien sage|pg||
nt|ahollan1: consider it a hypothetical question|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or -- actual case in other room|pg||
nt|petergill: Aside from being arguably the world's best player, Jeff Meckstoth is famous for upping the ante quickly, making opponents guess, so when he bids 4@s you are less sure that he has ...|pg||
nt|petergill: his bid. One dividend from this approach is that opponents misguess a lot. |pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4S|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: Demirev asking Zia what 3 Diamonds is and Zia shrugs shoulder|pg||
nt|marlowepi: over 3C i would bid 4S al|pg||
nt|petergill: The Dutch team is affected by some new partnerships being formed e.g. Bertens - Westra, no more Verhees - Jansma nor Bakkeren - Bertens, according to my mail|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: what's the record?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and over 1C i wouls bid 1S|pg||
nt|jcmax: Whereas 31D would be an invitational + @S raise|pg||
nt|petergill: Michel Bessis was choosing between Dbl and 4@D - taking space away with 4@d seems best. |pg||
mb|2C!|nt|ritong: 1SA après passe montre 4 et 6, exactement ce qu il a|pg||
nt|ritong: bretagne va donc dire 3@d|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: petite pause|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: bretagne revient|pg||
nt|ahollan1: diamond still in the tank -- i suspect 4@S would get most votes, but maybe DBL first|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@H=3-10 HCP, 5+@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Kit Woolsey sitting west bid 1@C-1@S//2@C   color me confused|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|ahollan1: any guesses about 2@D?    a) only positive  b) 0-1 controls  c) other|pg||
nt|petergill: East is a passed hand, so West will not get too excited|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2 ways to play Unusual vs Unusual     the most common uses low q [3@C] to show low suit [@H] and hi q [@D] to show hi suit [@S]|pg||
nt|petergill: North needs just a bit more, e.g. @HJ or @CJ, for slam to be there|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: leenhardt sera d accord|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: 4@s chez françois je pense|pg||
nt|farfie: François devrait nommer la manche|pg||
nt|ahollan1: system summary for Welland-Willenkin is online from 2009 Team Trials, but it doesn't mention 1@S-2@C :(|pg||
nt|petergill: Thanks Al|pg||
nt|jcmax: I am guessing 0-1 controls, but we really don't know|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: long thinking by DeKnijff|pg||
nt|warrens:  oops, 6 only|pg||
nt|petergill: 6@C needs @HA onside plus 3-3 diamonds or some squeeze|pg||
mb|3N|nt|po-s: I see seven too|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: Bathurst asking about leads and carding|pg||
nt|petergill: the trump promotion to beat that 2@S is so routine for these guys that we made no comment|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: on 20, Demirev sitting East bid 2@D over reopening DBL -- Multon playing 2@S from South|pg||
nt|petergill: with South on lead, finding the club ruff is not easy|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and Diamond does start with DBL -- so much for predictions|pg||
mb|4S|nt|marlowepi: i dont want to hear 5D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the other - and probably theoretically better is  low q = the other major and hi q = limit+ raise of partner|pg||
mb|p|nt|farfie: parfait|pg||
nt|ritong: les deux jeux collent parfaitement|pg||
nt|ahollan1: gonna guess - artificial game force|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: i am not able to see the writing for the alerts|pg||
nt|ahollan1: where 3@H=transfer  i've seen 3N used for specifically 2@S & 5@H -- but never this hand|pg||
nt|jcmax: Anybody bidding these cards to slam should be very proud. Bridge is not always a just game :)|pg||
nt|petergill: South is on lead, hence no lead-driecting dbl|pg||
nt|marlowepi: diamond's partner not allowed to bid diamonds?|pg||
nt|petergill: Great lead, suit pref @C3 to say I have @DA as an entry|pg||
nt|petergill: the reason not to lead @DA, as most players would woodenly do, is|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: ça n a pas été necessaire, les adversaires sont allés a trois tout seuls|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: Thnak you by DeKnijff|pg||
nt|petergill: so 3NT by West is the best spot, as 6@C is les than 50%|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: FOUND IT --- "1C-1S, 1red-1N,1S-2C are ART GF relays, any distribution"|pg||
nt|petergill: that dummy surely has a singleton @D in order to bid 4NT|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ritong: il va juste examiner le cas des @ss 4/1|pg||
nt|petergill: Our operator Debbie Hyatt is the only one of several replies to be right - answer = Pepsi|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this 2-way checkback sequence shows specifically 5@S and is COG [choice of games]|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@C checkback, when followed by 3NT it shows five spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D as artificial game force would be used if also interested in 4@H|pg||
pc|h2|nt|vugraphzjd: e-w count signals is said all laughter maybe count?|pg||
nt|warrens:  2 @S's, 1@H, 2@D's & 1@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry -- Demirev WEST|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h8|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cJ|nt|ritong: mais c est un peu étrange de ne pas dire 3@d, deux bonnes cartes avec le part et neuf atouts connus|pg||
nt|ritong: vulnérable ou pas|pg||
nt|ritong: il me semble qu il etait tres legerement supérieur de jouer vers 108x|pg||
nt|ritong: a cause du 9 sec a gauche|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c4|pg||
nt|petergill: so you need more tricks to beat 5@H |pg||
nt|jcmax: But the interesting problem really is whether the 31D bid creates a forcing pass auction or not when the opponents compete.|pg||
nt|petergill: This bidding method avoids (or minimises) telling the defence what declarer's hand shape is|pg||
pc|s9|nt|ahollan1: when partner opens 1@S -- you can't tell which method is being used :)|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ritong: mais c est juste instinctif|pg||
nt|ahollan1: I don't know Zagorin-Bathurst, but partnerships who allow choice of opening with 4@C & 4@D will often choose 1@D when @Sxx |pg||
nt|ahollan1: that way easy rebid if opponents bid @S and partner makes negative dbl|pg||
nt|petergill: when they end up in 3NT|pg||
pc|sK|nt|petergill: 6@S is not a bad contract. I'm not sure if 6@S, 6NT or 3NT is the best contract to be in, based on 26 cards|pg||
nt|petergill: or pehaps in 6@C one might play for the person with the 3rd trump to have 3+ @d's, by drawing 2 rounds of trumps then playing diamonds, ruffing the 4th @D if possible|pg||
nt|petergill: My info about the Dutch pairs is confirmed by specs|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|s4|nt|ahollan1: not always?       when, if ever??|pg||
nt|petergill: hence you try the clubs, before the spade side suit you expect in dummy makes all the tricks|pg||
nt|jcmax: If 3@D is inv+ it can hardly create a forcing pass situation. Only when it was GF to begin with.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jcmax: The EW hands are really a perfect mesh. Except that NS have a ruff coming.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: for a while, after Eddie Kantar published his book -- everybody knew what was / was not forcing|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|petergill: Reason = due to Nickell team's dominance, it's hard for other Americans to qualify to play in enough WBF events to be rated highly, unless they come from somewhere else!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but the book is out of print|pg||
nt|jcmax: I wish I had a copy!|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: laughing|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: Thomas is leaning forward |pg||
nt|petergill: Sabine is right - is Pass or 4@s weaker on this auction (Pass, non forcing, I think), and is Pass or 3@s weaker if East doubles 3@D (3@S, I think)?|pg||
pc|s3|pc|d7|pc|sQ|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d4|nt|ahollan1: in modern systems, 1@C frequently promises unbalanced hand or 5+@D|pg||
nt|warrens:  Bathurst is a young player, mid to late 20's, used to play with Justin Lall.  Very strong and aggressive|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ach --- modern treatment 1@C covers all balanced hands and 1@D unbal or 5+ depending upon agreement|pg||
nt|warrens:  Maybe someone can fill us in about Zagorin.|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d8|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d5|pc|dJ|nt|ahollan1: overtricks are very important in this tournament because of the VP scale that is used|pg||

nt|petergill: To read about the controversy about Italy's 2010 team, one goes to the BBO Forum at http://forums.bridgebase.com/index.php?showtopic=38622&st=15|pg||
nt|ahollan1: nice auction, good declarer technique|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ritong: et également ARD9 a gauche, mais dans les deux cas il aurait pris un pain|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Helgemo-Helness never sniffed at slam either|pg||
nt|warrens:  I'm told Bathurst is 31-32 and has won one Dutch national championship event.  |pg||
nt|ahollan1: Verhees-Jansma-van Proiijen [?sp] played in 3 different partnership combinations .. ALL playing a different convention card|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|ritong: ça ne va pas passionner poizat|pg||
nt|ritong: donc..:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: 3@c?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: NS transfers over 1@C|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@S = ART FG Relay|pg||
nt|petergill: 31-32 HCP with no fit didn't appeal to these world-class players for slam, but often appeals to lesser players|pg||
nt|petergill: and you should give a suit pref lead on opening lead, as you will not have much chance for a suit pref signal if partner wins @HA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wow -- in other room the auction went   3@C-DBL-P-4@H//P-4@S-end|pg||
nt|petergill: that was a truly great lead by Zia|pg||
mb|3D|nt|warrens:  this team: Zagorin-Bathurst & Brink-Drijver finished 3rd in last year's Reisinger|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Brink-Drijver still young too|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: with Michel Bessis's hand, I would stay out of the auction - when vulnerable, I don't like to bid bad suits in bad hands|pg||
nt|ahollan1: especially hard to diagnose slam in 5-2 fit without bypassing 3N [board 4]|pg||
nt|po-s: and they will play for Netherlands in this year´s European Chships|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and yes, they won the event|pg||
nt|petergill: The controversy is that Fantoni - Nunes have been omitted from Italy's team, in order to put Bocchi - Madala in the team|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 12: 3NT would also have made, so no swing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder if that 2@H was forcing -- quite strong for "constructive"|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: but this father-son partnership from France has done very well indeed since joining the Zimmerman squad, so perhaps his action has more appeal than i realise|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C=Drury|pg||
mb|d|nt|vugraphzxr: il ne pousse pas trop pour le moment|pg||
nt|petergill: What should North lead?|pg||
nt|petergill: if West passes|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzxr: 3@s contré est assez probable non?|pg||
nt|farfie: françois a noté que son partenaire n'a pas pu dire 1@s,|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: oui|pg||
nt|farfie: donc je doute qu'il soutienne|pg||
nt|ahollan1: tough position here for Zagorin -- wrong side NT, pass seems wimpy   maybe 3@S?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oops  forgot Bathurst PASSED hand|pg||
nt|po-s: next month - in Ostend, Belgium for potential kibitzers/tourists|pg||
nt|ahollan1: lead?  opposite passed hand -- do you agree with Bathurst's PASS?|pg||
nt|petergill: Should West have bid 1@S, doubled or passed? Opinions would vary. |pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: reach for bid by Michel then stops|pg||
mb|3H|nt|ahollan1: and South PASS or 1N ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: THank you by Thomas|pg||
nt|jcmax: At the other table W actually already opened 1@S. Opening bid seem to get lighter and lighter|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but North and East bidding spot on|pg||
nt|petergill: the fate of the contract seems to be depend on picking @d's|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: prend, joue @d|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: I cant see Bathurst cards|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@D is - when in doubt, bid, don't pass = the approach which has helped make Jeff Meckstroth (one of) the world's best player(s)|pg||
mb|3N|nt|ritong: et zigouille le valet de @c au final|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D=ok hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 4@S=game try :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: lots of talking on both sides of screen explaining alerts|pg||
nt|petergill: and Meckstroth's 3@D bid took away just enough bidding space to puch EW overboard|pg||
nt|petergill: A boring 3NT to catch my breath|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: so i am guessing|pg||
mb|p|nt|farfie: j'ai tout faux:)|pg||
nt|jcmax: And 6@C would be no fun on a @D lead either. and realistically I would expect anyone to bid xxxx in @C with a 1S suit like that!|pg||
nt|ahollan1: results from Round 1 are online at http://www.cavendishinvitational.com/2010/TEAMS1-1S.htm|pg||
nt|davidstern: It may be dated but Brink Drijver's system card http://bridgefiles.net/pdf/2007-brink-driver.pdf|pg||
nt|jcmax: Declarer will most likely play for the @C A onside, ruff a @C in dummy, pitch a @D on a heart and hope for trumps 3-2. Easy game :)|pg||
nt|jcmax: That doesn't look like this year's teams to me yet, Al.|pg||
nt|davidstern: The VG matches are chosen live after the results are in so we are unable to tell you who will be next but it will usually involve the leading teams|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: Brink is pinching his nose and thinking hard|pg||
nt|ahollan1: there's a Bridge Base Forum that lists the open team makeup for the European Championship|pg||
nt|petergill: Almost all (or most?) experts open the very strong South hand 1@H, not 2@C, so that the hand can be bid accurately, without losing bidding space. |pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: sorry John I made a mistake|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think 4@D = Grant Baze covention -- showing BALANCED raise to 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: Thomas Bessis will delay any @d guess as long as he can, to get info about the opponents' HCPs|pg||
nt|petergill: The defence can get 4 spades (one from ruffing @h's), one heart, and 1 or 2 diamond tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: Both Thomas and Zagorin have the palms of their hands on their cheeks|pg||
nt|jcmax: Yes, but South can only get N in with a @D, so there would be no guess then.|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: on different sides of the table thinkin|pg||
nt|jcmax: But declarer of course may play N for 5@H and go up with the @HA|pg||
nt|petergill: so perhaps North should underlead @DA when he wins @HK, then?|pg||
nt|petergill: if he can play double dummy|pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: you might be tempted if you know a weak spot in opponents relay methods - but pass then bid in game forcing auction is huge risk|pg||
nt|petergill: When the opponents had not yet disclosed their suits and were possibly heading slamwards using artificial methods, West rightly thought those conditions made intervention more ...|pg||
nt|petergill: attractive, to reduce the effectiveness of NS's auction |pg||
nt|petergill: and 2@H removes quite a bit of bidding space from NS|pg||
nt|petergill: I'm making quite a good case that Michel Bessis bids better than I do :)|pg||
nt|jcmax: DEclarer may very well feel S is more likely to hold a singleton 1H for his penalty pass than a doubleton|pg||
nt|jcmax: And so he did.|pg||

mb|p|nt|marlowepi: breathe through gills|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: would have been interesting to see if relay could sniff out possible 6@C|pg||
nt|petergill: 6@C fares better than 6@D|pg||

nt|ahollan1: if people are interested, holler and i'll find the url|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: with good shape, bid a lot - with poor shape, stay out = the style|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's the basis for RM Precision -- shape rules|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ahollan1: even better if @C9 instead of @C8|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@h looks like a cue agreeing @d's|pg||

nt|davidstern: They refer to a prior year|pg||
nt|davidstern: I am having it fixed|pg||
nt|jcmax: This way if E happens to have a doubleton @C and 3 trumps, he will still make|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: he is still looking at all the hearts down comes the screen|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that is great explanation :)|pg||
nt|jcmax: If he drew 2 rounds of trumps before trying to ruff the @C e would overruf and there would be no entry to dummy's @H-winner|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: up screen|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: down screen again|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i was trying to work out possibilities if win @H then duck @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: delaying choice of discard on 3rd @H|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: up again now hearts still all showing at the table|pg||
nt|ahollan1: since it seems all lines require @CA onside|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: all cards now turned over|pg||
nt|jcmax: It seems to me the only time you can make this contract with the @CA offside is when W has KQ doubleton in @D. But you also have to play for it, and who would do that?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: for specs who haven't played using screens -- the screen is lowered so that only one defender asks/answers questions without risking unauthorized info to the other defender|pg||
nt|davidstern: The theory is better than the reality of course|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
nt|davidstern: One usually knows who is thinking and if there is some movement in terms of explanations on the other side|pg||
pc|s9|nt|petergill: Pepsi is an American now - he plays in American trials|pg||
nt|petergill: though 3@DX would have been either 800 or 1100, about the same as 3NTX|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ahollan1: i can't tell Sabine -- is that supporting my idea of duck @D at trick 2??|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ahollan1: assumes @C aren't breaking so @S|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|ritong: mais tout ça est académique  onze plis|pg||
nt|ahollan1: now that @H9 is good, doesn't look like West has any good options, but we know that defense can always generate 2nd trump trick|pg||
nt|petergill: To read why, you go to that thread, then follow the links from its 2nd page to the Neapolitan Club website, which has comments from many Italians on the situation.|pg||
nt|petergill: You win some, you lose some - it won't stop Meckstroth from risking 3@d the next time he has the same position|pg||
nt|ahollan1: again -- nice technique|pg||
pc|h4|nt|petergill: I agree with Al|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|jcmax: Cashing the @CA was an excellent play!|pg||
pc|h3|nt|petergill: the long weak heart suit, with no dbl of 4@h and no raise by partner, was unpromising as a source of tricks|pg||
nt|petergill: Kevin Bathurst has his cap on, as usual. Daniel Zagorin is to the right of the screen|pg||
nt|jcmax: Because S will be endplayed when ruffing the @H|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: Thomas showing hand|pg||
nt|jcmax: Very well played!|pg||
nt|petergill: yes, a wonderful play, to endplay South|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Roy [Welland] didn't see Peter's @D10 comment|pg||
nt|petergill: @DKx onside is more likely than @DKJx onside, hence the normal play by South|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|dT|pc|d7|pc|s2|pg||
nt|warrens:  yes, but declarer has to avoid playing a trump to the 10 or he's down on a club ruff|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ahollan1: T recognized free @H finesse is illusion|pg||

nt|petergill: I pressed the wrong button|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@H looks likely now, given that the misfit makes slam unlikely|pg||
nt|petergill: or perhaps he's thinking that 4@s will play better opposite 2-3 in majors?|pg||

nt|petergill: 2@S enquiry|pg||
pc|h2|nt|petergill: 6-2 fits with good trumps are less susceptible to 4-1 breaks (and thus usually better) than 5-3 fits are|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'd like a recount please|pg||

pc|hA|pg||
nt|petergill: The normal 3NT contract is doomed on the normal lead|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but Helness chose 4@S instead of 3N|pg||
nt|jcmax: At the other table the contract is 4@S, which no doubt has better chances than 3!NT on a @D lead|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@S has some play, but the 4-1 club break makes 4@s difficult|pg||

nt|warrens:  oh, a 6th @D makes it automatic.|pg||
nt|warrens:  after the ruff sluff in @D's, this will make because of the favorable @H position|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this set seems to be very declarer friendly|pg||
nt|po-s: of course North can drop HT to encourage declarer to run jack next|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: Thomas has his hands locked behind his head and staring at the dummy|pg||
nt|po-s: or nine rather|pg||
nt|warrens:  he's thinking about how to make with one spade loser and one heart loser|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 22  Zimmerman in North did not bid over 1@H opening -- later DBL convinced Multon to jump to 3@S|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: now one had covering his mouth|pg||
nt|ahollan1: where Bathurst struggled to make 2@S, Multon made 3@S after @H lead|pg||
pc|h4|nt|petergill: the transfer response, just as Jacoby Transfers over 1NT do, also allows more space to bid sensibly|pg||
nt|petergill: Back on Bd 3 - it's hard to pass 4@H, because 4@D by East over 3@D would show both majors, not a strong hand with @H's - there are many hands where East bids 4@h and 6@h is cold. I ...|pg||
nt|petergill: blame NS for EW getting overboard, not blame E (just has a 4@H bid not a 3@H bid) nor W |pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: Zia that is he doesn't like it --- Demirev if "its small"|pg||
nt|marlowepi: board 3 of the spring fours?|pg||

nt|ahollan1: i see it, but still wouldn't have included 5@S in my list of bids to consider|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's why i type instead of play|pg||
nt|petergill: on @H lead, can get rid of club loser and then set up H's (picking @H's), so there was no defence  |pg||
nt|petergill: Huub Bertens is a wonderful card play thinker|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|ritong: je n ai aucun commentaire pertinent a proposer|pg||
nt|petergill: With Zimmerman having a big lead in the event, and this being the 2nd last match, NS are playing for swings - hence the Dbl of 3Nt and the 2Nt bid here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: transportation gets to be big issue if misguess @S now|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ahollan1: transfer responses gain in other ways too --- some use 1N rebid to show the hand that normally jump rebids 2N|pg||
nt|davidstern: Zimmerman's lead is 32 VP's with 30 available in any one match|pg||

nt|ahollan1: still no results posted from round 4 -- sorry folks|pg||
nt|davidstern: So this will now make?|pg||
nt|petergill: Even on @h switch and misguess, North gets squeezed in the minors, so there was no defence|pg||
nt|petergill: @D10 protects partner's jack|pg||
nt|petergill: so we can expect plenty of imagination from Jeff Meckstroth and Zia in this match|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sJ|nt|petergill: Sabine's right - the lack of aces in the North hand makes Kx not enough for 3NT, I guess|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ahollan1: drum roll|pg||

pc|s7|pg||
nt|davidstern: Unlike any other match Peter ???|pg||
pc|s8|pc|d3|pc|sT|nt|petergill: Good defence (@H switch) to reduce pressure on East who might otherwise get endplayed on some layouts|pg||
nt|petergill: I think he might play a spade to the king, then back to @SA, then ruff a @D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: easy game|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|s9|pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: too right Peter -- the swing is result of Zia-Meck bidding and defense not EW actions|pg||
nt|jcmax: Of course if South had Q10x in @D instead of just Q10  3NT would be such a superior choice!|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ahollan1: David returns from vugraph operator duties|pg||
nt|davidstern: I am so lucky that I have a team of VERY keep operators who all want to work|pg||

pc|d6|nt|petergill: he merely needs 4-3 @d's|pg||
nt|davidstern: merely|pg||
nt|petergill: He might take his time about whether to cash @DQ or ruff a small @D - both lines work|pg||
nt|davidstern: On a heart lead no problem as club disappears so no real defence to even test declarer|pg||
nt|petergill: Correct|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but that hand might bid 3N instead of 3@S --- i'm beginning to think that bridge is a tough game|pg||

nt|davidstern: The OR result may not be that hard to copy|pg||
nt|petergill: North's slow cards - KQJ and Q9 and no supporting club honour, argue for 4@S. With faster tricks and less spade texture, e.g. A10xxx, Kxxx, Kx, QJ, 3NT would appeal more. |pg||

nt|petergill: 2@C Stayman|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: thanks to spectator who provides Michael's quote "always play a nine on defense ... unless you have to"|pg||
nt|davidstern: Well done by Bertens|pg||
nt|petergill: Kit Woolsey's second Dbl might have been in part to avoid partner going on to 5@S on some layouts|pg||
nt|petergill: This is the last session - this match, then two more 9 board matches.|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcmax: I suppose N's pass over 2@S is a function of the partnership's light opening style|pg||
pc|dK|nt|warrens:  either W leads a black card, give declarer the contract, or he gets squeezed in the black suits in the endgame|pg||

nt|vugraphzjd: attitude leads|pg||
pc|s9|nt|petergill: Much the same here - the Dbl was partly intended to stop partner going to 5@S. |pg||
nt|ahollan1: a truly vindictive Bridge God would have @H split 4-0 -- or @CA @C ruff|pg||
nt|petergill: The Wests are wrong when South has a 9 card suit, but right most of the rest of the time. And how likely is "two 9 card @h suits in one match"?|pg||

nt|ahollan1: NS  upside down count & attitude -- no mention of Smith Echoes [but wouldn't apply here anyway]|pg||

nt|ahollan1: it either happens or it doesn't|pg||

nt|davidstern: 5@C N/S |pg||
nt|petergill: 3NT on a spade lead might be hard to make|pg||

nt|petergill: was held in 1998 in Lille, France. |pg||

nt|marlowepi: i think peter means aprc ontest|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidstern: E/W dont have anything of interest|pg||
nt|davidstern: Yes of course 3NT but only with the fortunate heart position - I would prefer 5@C at teams|pg||
nt|marlowepi: par contest|pg||
nt|petergill: Yes I do|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3D|pg||
nt|ahollan1: today The Great Shuffler is French|pg||
nt|petergill: when you have so much in a suit, sometimes it can he hard for experts to continue suits versus 3NT|pg||
mb|2N|nt|petergill: Dbl would be 4/4 in majors|pg||
nt|petergill: 3NT might attract a helpful club lead, but they might reach 4@s instead|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: the club exit would have prevented the 2nd endplay - sorry about my misanalysis - if I could analyse better, I would be playing in Las Vegas right now|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Peter mentioned East known as Pepsi -- but didn't mention that North is known as "Bus"|pg||
mb|3N|nt|petergill: More ultra-aggressive bidding by NS|pg||
nt|petergill: Will Thomas bid 5@h or Pass?|pg||
nt|petergill: 5@H seems to be one level too high|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i don't think enough shape to pull - but it is close|pg||
nt|ahollan1: show of hands -- how many remember when North hand never thought of any bid but PASS|pg||
nt|warrens:  yes, I like S bidding, especially as a passed hand.  should be -1 in 5@D, assuming good defense |pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: obviously that DBL was NOT Responsive, but some form of Rosenkranz [showing @C honor]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i've always suspected that invitational 1m-2N is the least sensible agreement in modern bridge|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: tiens, il cherche la baston|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: Drijver lays down 10 tricks of cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: nice lead|pg||
nt|davidstern: One of my better predictions|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this might not be that great for EW|pg||
nt|davidstern: Likely only -1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Bus Driver ....  honest|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Helgemo range must be 15-17 because he opened 1@D  Helness treated his @S as 4-bagger so 3N south|pg||
nt|jcmax: With nohcp in his long suit and everything outside N may feel he only wants to play in @S if partner has 4 cards, but not with 3.|pg||
nt|petergill: Daniel Zagorin wsiely treated his weak five card suit as if it was four cards|pg||
nt|jcmax: So I guess the same judgment at both tables really :)|pg||
pc|s7|nt|farfie: oui,drole d'idée|pg||
nt|petergill: West would expect East to have a singleton spade|pg||
nt|petergill: on this bidding|pg||
nt|ahollan1: surely not enough shape for WELLAND to bid 5@H :)|pg||
nt|petergill: need to change to 5@H by West|pg||
nt|ahollan1: this is 4th of 9 9-board matches split into 3 sets of 3 matches|pg||
nt|davidstern: 2-1-1-0|pg||
nt|davidstern: The last three matches do allow for replay of a match played today|pg||
nt|ahollan1: there can be playback of teams, but not within a given 3 match session|pg||
nt|petergill: 5 @C plus 2@S and 2 aces to knock out - you need to knock out South's ace first, but then can the defence plays @Hs?|pg||
nt|petergill: At the other table, East played @D10 from dummy and North rose @DA in case partner had @SAJ10xx and no @HA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wouldn't @SK be better shot than @SJ?|pg||
nt|petergill: That was clever of East to foresee that the defence might do that|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: screen down|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: now up|pg||
nt|petergill: @SK at Trick 1, then @SJ at Trick 2, would clarify the spade position for North|pg||
nt|petergill: but seems a bit double dummy to me. |pg||
nt|ahollan1: i suppose @SJ hoping that partner holds @SA and declarer @SQx(x)|pg||
nt|petergill: On other alyouts - If partner had Ax in spades, @SK lead might wreck the defence if EW have lots of minor suit tricks|pg||

nt|ahollan1: sorry David -- you got there first|pg||
nt|davidstern: It is my understanding which may be wrong that the playback can only happen tomorrow during sessions 7-9|pg||

pc|h5|nt|petergill: Not clear which you should play|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well it is arguable. it means that when you know there is a complex problem on the hand you are excellent at spotting it and solving it. with no disrespect at all to Bart, who is ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: indeed a great player. it isnt a table-real context|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that could be David, i'm less than 100% confident about whether this set can have playback from session 1|pg||
nt|davidstern: My memory is aging and poor at best but I am pretty sure only tomorrow allows for playbacks|pg||
nt|davidstern: and only once|pg||
nt|petergill: club exit is normal, as South is expected to have @HA for the opening bid, and @HAK cannot run away|pg||
nt|marlowepi: bart gave me a zero at the table in Reno by seeing the problem without any probem being tipped. that impressed me|pg||
nt|petergill: @C4 exit makes it harder for South to count the hand out|pg||

nt|jcmax: No, the only bid worth mentioning is W's 2NT bid. many pairs these days have given up on playing this as natural and use it as an artificial raise of partner's suit instead.|pg||

mb|4S|nt|ahollan1: 1@D=5+@D or 4@D(441)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@D denies 3+@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: with 3@H make Support DBL|pg||
nt|petergill: Agreeing with Al on matters of system is usually a good idea for us commentators|pg||
nt|davidstern: And very unavailable|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: Sabine - do you think Wrang had any option other than 1@S?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: Wrang is pointing at 3 diamonds|pg||
nt|petergill: 1NT probably denies 3 spades|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@H has good chances|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@s was a good undoubled save against the making 4@H|pg||
nt|ahollan1: I'm with you there Peter -- just love to get that Defensive Driving line in whenever/wherever I can|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: Bas asking Pepsi ?'s|pg||
nt|petergill: When they were youths about 7 years ago, NS used to be known as Drink Driver. |pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: gulp -- i was about to say ho-hum 2N-3N  and ask how they find slam when East minors reversed|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: Zia writing|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@D is artificial GF if they play the same methods as I do|pg||
nt|marlowepi: what about if they play the same methods that they do?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: now Demirev is writing|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the 1N rebid is where 2 options arise -- in one camp 1N=strength of jump to 2N in the other [as appears here] 1N=2 of responder's suit and take the transfer = 3|pg||
nt|petergill: Sorry - we lack Convention Cards for these pairs. NS is not a regular partnership so they are playing basic Standard. |pg||
nt|ahollan1: or 2@D could be transfer|pg||
nt|petergill: warned not arned|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: car toutes les entames arrangent le déclarant|pg||

nt|warrens:  do we know what 4@H showed? minors with short @H?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: no explanation at the table|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hehe|pg||
nt|petergill: He's 26 still, just barely too old for youth bridge|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|vugraphzxr: entame @c file non?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 24 imps = 27-3  not quite enough to make Zimmerman a lock|pg||

nt|davidstern: If B/D havent changed system their 1NT is : 1NT Openings: 9-12 1st Fav, 15-17 o/wise|pg||

pc|h9|nt|vugraphzjd: screen down by Wrang|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or minors with better @C??|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: screen down and not Michel is asking|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2 only @H supports Peter's guess that 2@D is 2-way Checkback|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|petergill: The AB article was on the 2005 Bermuda Bowl I think - the writer gave endless examples of how if Australia reached 3NT more often, we gain vast number of imps |pg||
pc|d8|nt|ritong: maintenant, son souci est l es atouts|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can they negotiate the @H ruff?   even looking at all 4 hands it takes a good eye to see the best defense|pg||
nt|petergill: EW have tried to transfer the declarer (of spades) to West, but have ended up wrongsiding the declarership of hearts|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: Zia says don;t lead it my lead|pg||
nt|warrens:  makes 6@H by W but only 4 by E|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@S relay, so that 4@h on 4333 opposite 4333 can be avoided in favour of 3NT|pg||
nt|petergill: the relay also allows more accurate slam bidding|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe downgrade hand and 2@C was only path to Inivite  ---  or opportunity to see cool treatment of 2@S|pg||
nt|petergill: West's singleton heart and @SA has encouraged him to go for the jugular (= blood)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: single dummy this actually has some chance of overtrick|pg||
nt|petergill: For anyone looking at MOVIE of Bd 24: On Bd 24, there is an error in the transcribing - on @D10, dummy pitched a heart, not a spade|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ahollan1: either way --singleton Ace and @Dxxxx makes it a iffy choice|pg||
nt|petergill: Meckstroth likes to play "reverse lead-directing doubles"|pg||
nt|petergill: Club or spade lead is best, but surely a @d lead is most likely in real life|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d6|pg||
nt|warrens:  this is a horrible contract and deserves to go down.  needs 3-2 trump with the K onside, plus more help|pg||
nt|ahollan1: unless it is right -- then it is brilliant choice|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ahollan1: no @H - @H ruff means this will be fast hand |pg||
pc|s2|pc|sA|nt|ritong: ici, lasserre a fortement suggéré @s|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm told specifically 5@C 4@D slammish|pg||
nt|petergill: EW knew that they had wrongsided @Hs so they had to stop in 4@H|pg||
nt|jcmax: The auction was basically the same at both tables. I am wondering whether maybe E might pass out 4@H knowing that partner unlikely will pass the double with 4 cards in 1S.|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|ritong: et le singleton est connu|pg||
nt|ritong: puisqu il a reparlé sur 4@h|pg||
nt|davidstern: Here are two hands I wrote up on Bessis http://www.eurobridge.org/bulletin/09_1%20Sanremo/pdf/Bul_10.pdf|pg||
mc|10|nt|vugraphzxr: cette donne sera surement une egalité|pg||
nt|petergill: they can see only 13 cards when they lead. We can see 52. |pg||
nt|ritong: i can tell you michel bessis is grumbling inside|pg||
nt|ahollan1: depends upon which glasses being used|pg||

mb|3D|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|flash: 2@C for the majors; 2@H a form of unusual over unusual??|pg||
nt|jbgood: I think Geir will pass - if Tor was really game interested, wouldnt he have doubled?|pg||
nt|jbgood: 3 @d?|pg||
nt|jcmax: N's 2@C call obviously showed the majors. So e's 2@H bid is artificial. Looking at his hand it may be both minors with longer @C|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcmax: That would explain W's 3@D call|pg||
nt|brolucius: You were right, Jon. A game was possible but North had not invited one.|pg||

nt|ritong: leenhardt pourrait imposer la manche|pg||
nt|ahollan1: especially with trump entry to dummy [22 trump or singleton @S10]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: at least i don't think that they are a well established partnership|pg||
nt|petergill: Club shift more or less places West with @CK, so perhaps the "heart before @D" play could have been found|pg||
nt|petergill: West's greedy Double was perhaps influenced by his rubber bridge activities in which taking penalties from unwary vulnerable takeout doublers is a favourite for most experts |pg||
nt|ahollan1: last board of this match -- 2 more 9 board matches remain to finish out the event|pg||
nt|petergill: Looking at the webcam http://www.cavendishinvitational.com/webcam/2/table2.jpg|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|davidstern: Only 8 tricks N/S in NT and 4@D for E/W|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 6 was 300 (2SX) to 200 (4@S -4) as we expected = 3 imps|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: Roy pulls out 2 spades bid and pputs back|pg||
nt|petergill: 2 and a half spades perhaps?|pg||
nt|davidstern: 2.275|pg||
nt|ahollan1: some pairs use 2N as spade raise -- that would work well here with in-between hand|pg||
nt|davidstern: IMHO|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: now bids 3 clubs and is writing to Thomas|pg||
nt|petergill: or 3@D? or Dbl? Not 3@s which is weak |pg||
nt|ahollan1: I sort of like 2@S  intending to bid 3@H given the opportunity|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe that brings DBL into Welland's options|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: This is the last board of the day|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N=15-17, not 5@H/@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: usually 15-20 minute break between rounds|pg||
mb|1N|nt|vugraphzxr: non c est sr il sait qu il est a moins l infini pas cool au moment d aller faire les points|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: meyer stretz c est leur deuxieme finale perdue|pg||

nt|davidstern: Change the 2's to 1's for the other table|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|ritong: en tout cas il y songe|pg||
nt|davidstern: Apparently 3@C is a transfer to 3@D|pg||
nt|davidstern: which is cue raise|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@C might show hearts and 2@H show clubs, if they are into switching responder's bids when two suits have been bid |pg||
nt|ahollan1: and none of us saw THAT coming :(|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: moren writing on both sides of the screen|pg||
nt|davidstern: Migry was suggesting it to me|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Diamond will open West hand on  8 1N [14-16]   I suspect he'll declare @H also|pg||
nt|petergill: The most recent thread about Jeff Meckstroth on BBO Forums (discussion group) is http://forums.bridgebase.com/index.php?showtopic=38901|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2@C alert because does not promise a 4-card major|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: now P-P-3@C//P-3N ??|pg||
nt|marlowepi: advantage of not playing precision, u can open 1D here and have it be worthwhile|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well that 2@C is NOT Meckwell   so maybe earlier 2@D did automagically show @D & @S|pg||
nt|davidstern: Here is an interview with Thomas which I did last June http://www.eurobridge.org/bulletin/09_1%20Sanremo/pdf/Bul_12.pdf|pg||
nt|petergill: from webcam, I have found a way to criticize the Cavendish which otherwise seems entirely uncriticizable - the tabels are a bit too small because it should be possible to keep the ...|pg||
nt|petergill: bidding tray parallel to NS|pg||
mb|3C|nt|ahollan1: enter and sign in please|pg||
nt|ahollan1: or maybe DBL now|pg||
nt|petergill: Directly to 4@S in case EW can make something, or slowly to explore our best spot? I think North has done it right|pg||
nt|jcmax: It is really a two-edged sword in my opinion, because very often you want to double to show values and hope partner will bid. difficult to have it both ways :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: Zia not quite hit the table with 3 clubs and now pulls it back|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: ben, ils seront sans doute en situation de décider si ils sauvent une journée ou pas, c est triste pour eux|pg||
nt|davidstern: Welcome to Warren Spector|pg||
nt|warrens:  hi all.|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i thought DBL was a reach -- hence my 1st guess|pg||
nt|warrens:  is 3@C forcing? |pg||
nt|petergill: We will see two more 9 board matches tonight after this one|pg||
mb|3H|nt|davidstern: Defence needs to get clubs going|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@D - to get the good four card support in - is normal among experts - 3@D is for wimps|pg||
nt|davidstern: Before declarer gets heart going|pg||
nt|petergill: Zia has a near maximum for 1D :)|pg||
nt|petergill: I am kidding|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@d negative|pg||
nt|ahollan1: last board of the set -- 1 more 9-board match tonight then 3 tomorrow|pg||
nt|ahollan1: side note: initial transfers for NS only promise 4|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidstern: I will take my leave to get ready for the next match and try and fix the webcam issue. Thanks for your company|pg||
nt|warrens:  looks like 3NT is the easiest game.  5@D a bid tougher|pg||
nt|ahollan1: do panelists rebid 3@D or 2@D holding void in responder's suit?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: after all these hands -- we don't even know if 1@C is always strong or  2-way [ala Baltic Club] and one-round force|pg||
nt|petergill: in the webcam at the bottom of http://www.cavendishinvitational.com, |pg||
nt|petergill: Thomas Bessis is the young French guy to the left of the screen, and the silvery haired guy to the right of the screen is John Mohan|pg||
mb|4H|nt|farfie: logique|pg||
nt|ritong: voila qui est fait|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the way Sabine & Daniela bid 'em up -- i suspect she wouldn't like her opponent's to adopt more penalty doubles |pg||
mb|d|nt|ahollan1: do either of you know -- which Bessis is dad, which is son?|pg||
nt|petergill: Interesting lead|pg||
nt|davidstern: Michel Dad Thomas Son|pg||
nt|warrens:  certainly not everyone plays it so|pg||
nt|ahollan1: good / tough question Warren    what IS the default?|pg||
nt|jcmax: Yes, I like all opponents that don't double :)|pg||
nt|davidstern: Peter in that case I will remove my webcams to reduce your angst|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzxr: tout ça est bien joué:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: egalité a 420  bien vu Q|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: plutot normal de jouer la manche et de la filer je pense|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: enfin bien joué de la déclarer et après on voit|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: patrice devrait mettre un petit du mort|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: pour garder une remontée au mort |pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: qu est ce que vous en pensez|pg||
nt|ritong: méjane aura un tit souci sur le @s suivant, si ce n est pas l as|pg||
nt|vugraphzxr: oui|pg||
nt|warrens:  Ivote for 3@D.  Lots of playing strength.|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: If NS have a 4-4 heart fit, I think the spade suit quality is not robust enough to make spades better than hearts. |pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: Jeff says Zia probably forgot what we were playing|pg||
nt|petergill: The 4th trump has encouraged his bold double. |pg||
pc|d3|nt|petergill: I think over 50% of top experts would open South's hand 1@d in 3rd seat at this vulnerability. I certainly would|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes it is not good enough for 5D so 1D it is|pg||
nt|ahollan1: not positive but next set usually 15-20 minutes after match ends|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ahollan1: wow -- everybody knew except me|pg||
nt|ahollan1: so the partnership needs to discuss East's 2nd actions of DBL, 2N and 3 new suit|pg||
nt|petergill: South is Huub Bertens from Netherlands|pg||
nt|ritong: bertens/bakkeren won the pairs event not so long ago|pg||
nt|petergill: It's not clear that this is a singleton - running the @d is possible|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d4|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@D is good as a lead-directer, plenty of safety from the vulnerability, opposite a passed (North) hand EW are likely to have game on and 1@D makes it harder for EW to bid ...|pg||
nt|petergill: accurately|pg||
nt|marlowepi: excellent summary. plus if zia passed, there would be a UN enquiry|pg||
nt|petergill: Meckstroth never says "thanks you partner", even when he strikes a dummy as good as this one|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on 25, where we talked about Pepsi double of 2@H with @Sxxx --- Zhao took phantom save to 10@H [5@HX]|pg||
nt|petergill: On Bd 8, NS can just, but only just, beat 3NT, so minus 160 might be close to a flat board, instead of the disaster it looks like. |pg||
nt|petergill: On Bd 26 I mean|pg||
nt|petergill: Mahaffey won this event narrowly last year, with a big win in the last match|pg||
nt|petergill: First prize is $43,000|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ahollan1: 7-5, 3 aces, supporting quacks -- too right, 2@D would be very timid|pg||
pc|dK|nt|petergill: No problem in finding the vital switch|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but absolute best response   "the older one is the dad"  :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: THAT lead could make things much easier|pg||
nt|po-s: how would yoy ever be able to catch back later otherwise?|pg||
pc|d8|nt|petergill: with North having a weak hand on the bidding, leading away from a king is possible|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on  8  Diamond playing 6@H west -- gets @H lead    oh my|pg||
nt|petergill: Webcam is at the bottom of http://www.cavendishinvitational.com|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3 matches starting tomorrow morning 10:30 Las Vegas time -- then the evening is spent bidding on pairs for the main event|pg||
nt|petergill: Axxx is a strong trump holding for a defender to have - it can cause control problems for declarer|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: Jeff shows convention card to Thomas what 2 clubs means|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: Zia is talking to himself|pg||
nt|davidstern: Debbie Hyatt is doing a fine job here letting us know what is happening at the table - well done Debbie|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: Thomas says he will protect his right  at the end of the hand|pg||
pc|dT|nt|ahollan1: i think declarer was stil going to get @H right -- as an avoidance play to protect @CK|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ritong: mais piganeau ne crache pas sur la possibilité d un honneur sec en est|pg||
pc|d5|pc|h5|pg||

pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: too right -- kudos Debbie|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|petergill: I think that the idea is that by saying "thank you partner" your tone might help the defenders estimate how happy you are with the contract, so they keep silent on all matters at ...|pg||
nt|petergill: the bridge table including that one|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sT|nt|ritong: et l affaire est pliée|pg||
nt|petergill: Thomas Bessis was one of the best juniors (Under 26) in the world until he turned 26 not that long ago|pg||
nt|ahollan1: can we rewind -- i want to see how auction goes if Welland tries 2@S|pg||
nt|petergill: Alex Smirnov at the other table is the same age as Thomas - mid to late 20's|pg||
nt|davidstern: 27 I think|pg||
nt|petergill: NS's ultra-bold bidding on Bd 7 gained 12 imps for their side|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Alex had great run in big Australian Team event this year -- he was old man with junior Aussies and New Zealand transplant teammates|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i dont know anyone who says thank you partner in live bridge|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pg||
nt|petergill: Sorry, I stand corrected - Jeff has started regularly saying Thank You partner|pg||
pc|s3|nt|ahollan1: this is our last board of the session   next group of 3 9-board matches scheduled to begin in 1 hour 20 minutes|pg||
nt|warrens:  I don't understand why S played the @S K at trick one|pg||
nt|warrens:  but nothing matters much on this hand|pg||
nt|petergill: still, that was the normal start to the play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Zimmerman began the day with a 9 VP lead over 2nd place Bathurst and 16 over 3rd Diamond -- this blitz will leave the others with a LOT of work to do|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: Thanks commentators for your help and we will restart in about 20 minutes|pg||

pc|s9|nt|davidstern: I am a big fan of Thomas Bessis' game. i watched him do some amazing things in San Remo |pg||
nt|davidstern: And wrote about them in the Bulletins|pg||
nt|ahollan1: there's a reason this hand is still being played -- i just don't know what it is|pg||
nt|ahollan1: too right Warren -- @SK seems like never-play [i.e. it can never be right[|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: I mayhave missed the first play|pg||
nt|ahollan1: thanks again to our vugraph operator Debbie|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: sorry sometimes they don't show the cards played|pg||
nt|ahollan1: well - if she got trick 1 wrong, then i take away my thanks :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd:  I owe you a penny then|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but that would explain why no early claim when @D split 5-0|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: anyhow all bye for now will restart at 4 pm PDT|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i was thinking @S finesse at trick one was best shot|pg||
nt|warrens:  ruff high and claim on 3-2 trumps?|pg||
nt|po-s: me too - don´t think he can - spade finesse would have made it|pg||
nt|petergill: with Bas Drijver, the Dutch guy aged about 30, on the right of the screen|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ahollan1: Fallenius also in 6@D but De Wijs leads @D2|pg||
pc|h7|nt|marlowepi: the usual alutation is "is that all?"|pg||
nt|petergill: "Loser on loser" play to disrupt defence's communication if West had @CA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: assuming 2@S alerted because lebenohl situation -- 3@H seems a bit of a push  [spec asked about alert]|pg||
nt|petergill: @D2 at Trick 1 would have been natural count - that is how most French players signal|pg||
pc|c2|nt|petergill: pitching a @d from dummy looks normal, but declarer doesn't know the spade position|pg||
nt|petergill: I think he is wondering whether to ruff with the ace|pg||
nt|petergill: Earlier: best was to cash @CA, then low heart for ruff with @SA, then @d ruff|pg||
nt|vugraphzjd: Thomas and Huub are laughing at each other|pg||
nt|davidstern: @HA and diamond|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
