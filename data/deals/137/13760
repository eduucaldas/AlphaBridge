mb|p|mb|1N|nt|vugraphzjf: Demirrev waving his hand suggesting semi-forcing|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2NT possible now for West.|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: Auction results http://www.cavendishinvitational.com/2010/CIPPairsAuction2010.pdf|pg||
mb|2H|mb|d|nt|brolucius: But they want to play in a black suit.|pg||
mb|4H|nt|vugraphzjf: Next round here I have  chosen a Norwegian Feast Groetheim/Tundall vs Helness/Helgemo|pg||
nt|chessmaste: 6@C by East would be where you would want to be.......but.....|pg||
nt|brolucius: There would be a stewards' enquiry if East bid 6@C now.|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|brolucius: He has done well.|pg||
nt|chessmaste: Nearly|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: Demirev in thought|pg||
nt|brolucius: As he might well be.|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: They have right sided it anyway|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: But the spade break is a killer|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|po-s: rightsided?|pg||

pc|s5|pc|s9|pc|c7|pc|s4|pg||
mc|11|nt|po-s: in 5C there is no wrong side|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: What I am saying is that a diamond lead by north could see an issue|pg||
nt|brolucius: East might at least have tried the effect of playing the @S9 on the first round - to make the @S3 look like the top of @S3-2.  It may well not work, but worth a try.|pg||

nt|brolucius: I was lucky to be watching the great Garozzo, on BBO in the Italian Championships a week ago. He never missed a chance to play a card that would induce doubt into the opponent's ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: mind. (Even at the age of 82...) |pg||
mb|2S!|nt|po-s: And as you may have discovered so did Bramley|pg||
nt|brolucius: No doubt 2@D from Bramley would show a heart raise. So, he has to bid 2@S to show his diamonds.|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: I would be happy to know what Garozzo has forgotten in terms of bridge ability|pg||
nt|po-s: at a younger age badmittedly|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Bramley played the @S2.|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|vugraphzjf: Other table next macth Brink/Drijver Hamman/Compton|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|brolucius: PO tells me that South would have led low from a doubleton, so in that case the @S2 from East was the correct deceptive card.|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: Honesty time - I didnt see what he played but wiill chekc the board for you|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: Played the @S2|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: Pass or 4@H here???|pg||
nt|po-s: Bart is normally very careful |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|s5|nt|brolucius: It is much more difficult for declarer to calculate deceptive plays when the opponents use a non-standard form os leads/signals. No doubt that is why many pairs use upside-down ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: signals. |pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: Having finished 3rd in the last World Par Point toourney you would think he is|pg||
nt|po-s: This  is not going to make - I think|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: Declarer asking about leads and carding|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: It is certainly problematic. Even if you duck and play heart to jack all sorts of problems|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s8|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|po-s: And about your theories on carding, please donÂ´t mislead innocent spectators as to the reasons for one or the other|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer correctly play the jack (higher of touching cards), which leaves North in the dark as to the position of the @S10.|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: Next you will be telling us that this is an R Rated table|pg||
nt|brolucius: We have an innocent spectator in the house today?|pg||
nt|po-s: why else would you suggest bthat Polish leads are to confuse opponents?|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: Low heart to jack North MUST rise|pg||
nt|brolucius: Upside-down signals are acknowledged as being technically superior (at least when signaling attitude). The fact that opponents may be less familiar with that method is a small ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: bonus.|pg||

pc|sK|pc|s9|pc|s3|pc|sA|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: which he did instantly|pg||
nt|brolucius: North removes the entry to the blocked hearts.|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sQ|pc|d2|nt|vugraphzjf: North asking if E/W play Flannery|pg||
nt|chessmaste: I think that is a forbidden word|pg||
nt|brolucius: I thought the F-word was banned on BBO. You are lucky that Roland is not here.|pg||

nt|chessmaste: In any case, a certainty for 25 Conventions you Don't need to Know|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is well known that Reese thought it was the worst convention ever invented. ('Copes with a hand-shape that causes no problems whatsoever with natural bidding!')|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: It wasnt me it wasnt me it was him sitting north|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, but you are the messenger. |pg||
nt|jbgood: Hi David, Mark and all:)|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: South asking West of he is aware that there are time limits|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: Hi Jon|pg||
nt|brolucius: Hi, Jon. We nearly had the Director called just now. Some-one used the F-word.|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: Depending on which David you were referring to|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|nt|chessmaste: I have already sent an email to Roland - best to plead guilty but ......|pg||

nt|vugraphzjf: Flannery a good word?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: There he goes again...|pg||
mb|2N!|mb|p|nt|chessmaste: Macbeth|pg||
mb|3H!|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzjf: 3@S showed three spades|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c8|nt|brolucius: Many pairs nowadays rebid 3NT with no spade fit. 3@S shows a fit and North's enxt call can then be a cue-bid rather than a second suit.|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cA|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|s4|pc|s2|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|h2|pc|s6|pc|s8|pg||
nt|brolucius: It means that you cannot sign off in 3@S on a weak hand but this is quite a rare requirement.|pg||
nt|jbgood: the strong variation of 2 NT opener, swedes include the 20-21 in their 2@c opening, so the responder can bid a direct suit negative..|pg||
pc|s5|pc|h3|pc|sK|pc|s9|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sT|pc|c5|nt|brolucius: N/S open 2@C on 20-21 balanced. 2NT shows a stronger hand.|pg||

pc|hJ|mc|11|nt|brolucius: Victor Silverstone is obviously more awake than I am. He says that declarer could have caught West in a trump squeeze had he kept four clubs.|pg||
nt|brolucius: That would involve discarding the @D10 and using the last trump back to the blocked @DQ if West chose to unguard the @DK.|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: Sorry closing and reopening|pg||
