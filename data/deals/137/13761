mb|1H|mb|d|nt|poohbear: easy dbl over 1H|pg||
mb|4C|nt|poohbear: 4@c fit showing|pg||
mb|4S|nt|poohbear: I think thats a tad aggressive opposite a 3rd seat opener|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|nt|poohbear: worked out nicely though|pg||
nt|jbgood: not giving prd credit for the 3rd seat opener.. but still, |pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: That double if penalties may lead Helgie to make this by finding the @SJ|pg||
mb|p|mb|5H|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|poohbear: wow|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: so -500 against a thin game it seems|pg||
nt|poohbear: dunno what L'ecuyer is thinking|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|h5|pc|h2|pg||
nt|poohbear: despite his minimum point count he has a balanced hand with defense|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: Irrelevant I know but I automatically unblock in hearts in this situation|pg||
nt|poohbear: should just take his best shot aginst 4@s|pg||
nt|vugraphzjf: 4@S will go off if they find the @D ruff of course|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jbgood: i am sure Helgemo would have made 4@s - so - the diamond ruff is not easy to find|pg||

nt|jbgood: whyd risk a club lead when you have that heart collection?|pg||
nt|poohbear: now north had an easy dbl of 4@h|pg||
nt|poohbear: not a risk. When partner fit jumps he has decent values in that suit. |pg||
pc|cA|pc|c9|pc|c5|pc|c3|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cJ|pc|cK|pc|c4|pg||

pc|s9|pc|s4|nt|poohbear: Helness knew which king his partner had from the second @d play|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||
