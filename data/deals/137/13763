nt|flash: the general approach is to open 1@C unless they have a 5-card suit elsewhere (1@D with 4441)|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|flash: big hand in the North; with no long suit, 1NT seems a reasonable alternative|pg||

mb|1C|mb|1H|nt|flash: 1@C can be a doubleton|pg||
mb|d|mb|2C!|nt|flash: X probably an xfer to @Ss|pg||

nt|flash: could Compton have talked Hamman into PDI as well???  :)|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|c2|pc|c8|pg||
