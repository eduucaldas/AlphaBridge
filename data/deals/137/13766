nt|flash: unfortunately, we'd be guessing at the meaning of 4@C|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|flash: general try, no shortness??|pg||
mb|p|nt|reisig: I would have start with 2@c over 1@H|pg||
nt|chorush: This kind of hand is an example of the luck involved in this form of scoring. The Blanchards were slated to win 175 mps or lose 175 imps (assuming about half the field will bid the ...|pg||
nt|chorush: slam) entirely randomly|pg||
nt|flash: then Weinstein might have been willing to risk 5-level??|pg||

nt|reisig: A dull 4@h - I'd guess|pg||

mb|1N!|nt|flash: 1NT = @Cs??|pg||
nt|flash: with @S tolerance|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|vugraphzje: with support|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|reisig: One effort by Levin ..|pg||
nt|flash: 4@C now a control bid|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|reisig: I'd play 4@d as a @s cue :)|pg||
mb|4H|nt|flash: control bid - but the @DK would be worth its weight in gold; the singleton not so much|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|warrens:  was 1NT by East a transfer showing clubs?|pg||
nt|flash: @Cs and @S support seems to be the explanation|pg||
