nt|jbgood: well put David, a less than perfect defense may even allow 3 spades to make|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm a nice freak|pg||
nt|roswolf: practical bidding in the other room|pg||
nt|vugraphzqn: they|pg||
nt|arno11: looked like making only 5 but...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Created by the Danish engineer, J.H. Monrad, for chess! in 1928|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It was soon afterwards adopted by bridge|pg||
mb|1N|nt|athene: @C7 might be a big card if east plays 3nt on a club lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphpl2: witamy kibicow|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w were slightly unlucky in the other room|pg||
nt|rv: I agree, if it at all it means something logical, it should be the expn of t/o of @s with max pre-empt (close to opening hand)|pg||
nt|athene: but i certainly would never ever bid it unless i KNEW partner would know it was forcing|pg||
nt|arno11: in the closed room EW apparently had a misunderstanding about the meaning of 2NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: may be duplicated|pg||
nt|tomi2: I dont like the double of 3@D, for me it does not show Kjxx, its just for the lead, think one should bid something to committ the partnership to 4th level to show the willing to ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: play 4@H or 5@D|pg||
nt|henryb:  reaching 6@h is well done|pg||
nt|arno11: making 6 was right in the last bd|pg||
nt|fabsayc: that delayed 2nt in closed room would be minors for me|pg||
nt|athene: 1nt raptor i assume|pg||
mb|2D|an|monokolor M|nt|marlowepi: in other words, it means "i should have opened 1H"|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no diamond raise form South|pg||
nt|athene: showing 4major and longer minor|pg||
nt|athene: standard in poland - i guess they double with a normal 1nt overcall|pg||
nt|fabsayc: will keep north out of trouble|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well should anyway|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: other major + longer minor?|pg||
nt|athene: i.e. we discussed it not earlier than 30 minutes before the start of the session :) |pg||
nt|mdgraham: at least it wasn't vulnerable - and you never know, maybe the opps will go in 6@S |pg||
nt|petergill: Here in Australia, players like me who know that penalty doubles exist often seem to end up in the national team - that's how rare penalty doubles seem to be in 2010|pg||
nt|arno11: wd to balance|pg||
nt|arno11: 2@D = one major|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@D = 1 major I assume|pg||
nt|Walddk2: :)|pg||
nt|arno11: :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The Multi-Landy defence|pg||
mb|2S|nt|roswolf: same start as the other room|pg||
nt|athene: 2@D is asking for south's major, i am told|pg||
nt|athene: i think north has a shrewd idea which it will be|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: yes 7@H would however be very unlucky|pg||
nt|othered1: Agree, forcing in lebensohl, but I know some who invert it (2N then 3@S forces, 3@S direct invites.)  Lets partner reject 3@Con the right hand.|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: the @C10 might have been a good shot for the defence|pg||
nt|roswolf: even so dont particulary like dbl|pg||
nt|rv: Raptor is not very popular, Sandwitch nt to show other 2 suits after (1x)-(1y) is more popular|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@S to play opposite a spade suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: so East should buy 4@s |pg||
nt|peachy: if it was a Precision 1D, I'm not surprised|pg||
nt|Walddk2: correctable if West has hearts|pg||
pc|cT|nt|mdgraham: you might bid 2@D anyway, as with two spades the opposition are likely to be raising  |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why on earth do you need Leb there when you have 2@S as sign off?|pg||
nt|peachy: some also have agreement on which sequence show/denies stopper|pg||
nt|athene: well as i said, it's less useful, certainly, but it still has SOME use|pg||
nt|athene: you can differentiate between weak and invitational hands with clubs|pg||
nt|othered1: Was 4@S fast arrival or just accepting game.  If fast arrival, they must have high standards for free bids, while many pairs lower their standards in comp.|pg||
nt|xenya: no way to beat this it seems|pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: and you can differentiate between forcing and invitational hands in a major|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe, but South had spades|pg||
pc|cA|nt|roswolf: except north bid 3@S rather than 4@C|pg||
nt|brolucius: Not unreasonable for North to bid strongly on his hand, which has potential. 3@S by North at the other table was a bit on the cautious side.|pg||
nt|vugraphzqn: he missbid 3 @c|pg||
nt|vugraphzqn: then he bid 4@c|pg||
nt|roswolf: AAHHH|pg||
nt|rv: I prefer 1n O/C to show 15-18 though I like Sandwitch NT |pg||
nt|athene: east has a pretty good hand but she knows she is probably getting a club, rather than a spade, lead|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|athene: so her tiny club spots must be a concern|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the carnage in 2s doubled would have been massive|pg||
pc|cK|nt|roswolf: 2nt = enquiry for minor!?|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|roswolf: this is tight but can/should go -1|pg||
nt|jbgood: .. and if you want to play 4 @s, you dont give away your hand by bidding 4 @c?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: matchpoint methods, IMHBAICO. i would never give up strong NT overcall at IMPs. variety of approaches is certainly interesting though|pg||
pc|c9|pc|c7|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@S is forcing to game in my book|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why make bridge so complicated|pg||
nt|athene: but now suddenly they aren't so tiny after all|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|tihana: hi all|pg||
nt|mdgraham: amusing that East can't ruff a diamond in dummy |pg||
nt|athene: hi good evening|pg||
nt|tihana: from pula live :)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|athene: he plays this way to force the defence to give him a black-suit finesse|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c8|pg||
nt|roswolf: very interesting and i agree raptor is a pairs gadget|pg||
nt|athene: and in theory if you subscribe to all the standard Lebensohl tenets you can show or deny a diamond stopper, etc|pg||
nt|arno11: hopefully not really the @C6|pg||
nt|vugraphzqn: asking for signals now...|pg||
nt|jaapfr:  |pg||
nt|vugraphzqn: but cant heard...sry..|pg||
nt|arno11: so 5 Imps to Zweili|pg||
nt|petergill: A low spade switch at Trick 2 would have been excellent defence|pg||
pc|s3|nt|tomi2: yes! this works well when partner has the ace, if not op will often nottake a finesse if he has some other play available|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@S  rubbish   3@S  invite   4@S  game   KISS|pg||
nt|othered1: To avoid missing good slams or getting too high on the wrong hands.|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sK|pc|s7|pg||
nt|athene: spade finesse immediately i would think|pg||
nt|arno11: but still no problem to make 9|pg||
nt|athene: then all is well|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|nt|peachy: Hi and thanks for joing here, a little local color never hurts!!!!!|pg||
nt|athene: you can often use elimination-type positions to this end|pg||
nt|tihana: we strongly support she - who goes to bad at 8 :)|pg||
pc|h2|pc|s5|pg||
nt|mdgraham: don't mind where she goes, as long as she's bad :) |pg||
nt|athene: good girls go to heaven - bad girls go everywhere|pg||
nt|athene: well i agree, 4@S was the simple bid, but i am just saying what south's rationale was :)|pg||
nt|peachy: Roland is right, unless stron ground on artificial sequence bids, best just to bid what you think makes|pg||
nt|fabsayc: diamond return best|pg||
nt|arno11: shld be 400 and 6 Imps th EW|pg||
nt|petergill: Very hard for North to tell that it's not South who is short in clubs, I guess|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You would normally have six cards for the action Jerolitsch took, but you have got to bid the hand you are dealt. The world is not ideal|pg||
nt|arno11: 10 from 109x is never easy to see, most of the time you will think it shows only 2 cards|pg||
nt|petergill: Perhaps the clubs could have waited, perhaps on other layouts you need to take them at the start - I'm not sure|pg||
nt|xenya: still 8 tricks after a spade switch -- but might have depended on a heart guess if N played a trump at some point |pg||
nt|xenya: a heart i meant to say|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Those part-score swings are significant in short matches|pg||
pc|d6|nt|peachy: I'm thining he'll make an overtrick, but certainly at least 9|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mdgraham: bad girls got to Essex |pg||
pc|d7|pc|d4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I dislike too much science|pg||
nt|arno11: she|pg||
nt|peachy: Ahe, apologies|pg||
nt|peachy: She|pg||
pc|dK|nt|brolucius: The defenders have made no mistake and declarer will have to look long and hard to find anywhere to ditch one of his two diamond losers. I wish him good luck.|pg||
nt|arno11: having 76 in @C now wld be nice....:)|pg||
pc|d9|pc|d5|pc|d8|pg||
nt|fabsayc: declarer is sort of squeezed, this is not a claimer|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|marlowepi: so they play that a double of 1S is penalty? even playing gadgets i dont see any call but double on the S gand|pg||
pc|d3|nt|roswolf: or a revoke|pg||
nt|roswolf: a push|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hand, not gand (or gland)|pg||
nt|tihana: :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but we won't have any Essex Girl jokes here, thanks all the same|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: yes, if she runs nine then plays @HA and another, she might find an overtrick drops into her lap|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Straightforward games do not create swings|pg||
pc|dT|pc|s6|nt|athene: she might be thinking about throwing south in with one black suit to lead into the other|pg||
nt|athene: she knows south has a singleton heart|pg||
pc|h7|pc|c4|pg||
nt|athene: so @HA, @C7 now is a sure thing isn't it?|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hJ|pc|hT|pc|h6|pg||
pc|h3|pc|s2|nt|athene: south is counted for 4-1-2-6|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|petergill: The best defence is: club at Trick 1, trump switch, if club is played next, win that, take @SA, cash club (optional), throw declarer on play in diamonds before the last trumps are ...|pg||
nt|petergill: drawn|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s8|pc|d2|pc|h5|pg||
pc|s9|pc|c6|nt|athene: nicely played|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h9|pg||
nt|petergill: Very hard to find that pinpoint defence - might have to be Italian to find such play|pg||
nt|petergill: and thus get 2@S down two|pg||
nt|vugraphzqn: we...will have to restart sesion for a shor time....|pg||
nt|vugraphzqn: sry|pg||

nt|henryb:  A Romanian pair E-W?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: EW are from Germany according to the flags. Do you know them, Tomi?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They are from Munich I am told|pg||
nt|vugraphzqn: hii all...welcome back to Pula...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Read above :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: err, sorry, yes, misread|pg||
nt|Walddk2: She prefers Blue Club|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hello everyone|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: "Consus" is something, that I saw often in Poland but should be much more all over the world. In other countries single persons are sponsor of teams, here they have found some ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: multinational company that runs a bridge team!|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzqn: hii all...welcome back to Pula...|pg||
nt|athene: hi good evening everyone|pg||
nt|athene: 4@S should be reached here i think|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Multi defence, 1 major|pg||
nt|athene: spade finesse through the 1nt opener|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hi Peter and Vladimir|pg||
nt|petergill: Hi Roland, Vladimir|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: Hi Tomislav, continue great work|pg||

nt|vugraphzqn: ...good evenin to all...|pg||
nt|vugraphzqn: evening :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: EW do indeed play Blue Club I am told|pg||
nt|fabsayc: with double fit east can bid 2nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: well that looks strong|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@C  17+|pg||
nt|xenya: Hi Peter and Roland|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and hi to our operator, Tomislav|pg||
pc|s6|nt|peachy: Hello Tomislav and Bill|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good evening to Arno Lindermann|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We will be starting with boards 7 and 8 in this room, followed by comparisons from the other table when we circle back to board 1|pg||
nt|Walddk2: N-S from Croatia, E-W from Austria|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s5|nt|tomi2: Consus is trading with CO2 emission rights and sponsor a whole Bridge team, like vodafone sponsors manchester united|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Used to, they don't any more|pg||
nt|Walddk2: MU have AON now|pg||
nt|henryb:  East would have done best to pass 3@cX|pg||
nt|rv: not my chice of double with aceless hand opp a passed partner|pg||
nt|arno11: hi everyone|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|vugraphpl2: gajcyk wypytuje o licytacje|pg||
nt|brolucius: If they are playing Polish Club, 1@C may be a strong hand but is more likely to be based on a weak 1NT (if they rebid 1NT).|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@H maybe?|pg||
nt|roswolf: here definitely strong!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's not necessarily strong. Polish Club 1@C is ... 1. 12-14 balanced (often) - 2. 15+ with clubs - 3. Any 18+ hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: all friendly as it should be so this will make easily|pg||
nt|petergill: This lead attacks the entry to dummy's clubs |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good afternoon to Arno Lindermann from Austria|pg||
nt|arno11: hi everybody|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Arno|pg||
nt|vugraphzqn: hii comentators, hii Roland, hii kibs...welcome all..|pg||
nt|petergill: She Goes To Bed at 8pm leads the event with Zweili 2nd|pg||
pc|cA|nt|roswolf: true|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is 3.|pg||
nt|arno11: well done by EW|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes it is. Always difficult to bid a game when an opponent opens a strong NT|pg||
nt|peachy: But once you get there, only few if any guesses, when one opp is know to have strong NT|pg||
pc|c7|nt|mdgraham: Good evening all.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: all routes lead to 4@S it seems|pg||
pc|c2|nt|peachy: Welcome to Mike Graham, from England|pg||
nt|athene: you might expect NS to lock into spades after the 1@S opener, with south having three|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@D is 0-7|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes i agree, but italian style takeout double lands on feet once again|pg||
nt|roswolf: agreed rv|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|brolucius: West decides he is not worth anything stronger than 4@H (such as 4@C, splinter) because East limited his hand with the 1@D response.|pg||
pc|c8|nt|roswolf: and a diamond switch!?|pg||
nt|tomi2: they send two teams to Pula it seems. North is Krzystof Martens, he wrote several books in the past years, if you are an advanced or expert player and want to improve your game, ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: think about his books|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, they have a better fit in hearts :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 15 and 16 first, followed by comparisons from the other table when we circle back to board 9|pg||
nt|petergill: South will duck|pg||
pc|c3|nt|henryb:  3@c goes down 4, which is even better than the lucky slam|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@S can still be a weak NT and is forcing|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@H obviously confirms the 18+ hand|pg||
pc|h2|nt|roswolf: yes the italians have a lot to answer for|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Down 1 not too bad, N-S can make some diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|peachy: The other commentators for this match are Bill Frisby, England, and Raija Davis USA|pg||
pc|h7|nt|peachy: declare needs to pay spades for one loser. Or else get rid of a diamond loser, to make|pg||
nt|athene: i would just transfer and then bid 3nt with that west hand|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h6|pg||
nt|roswolf: trump is even better|pg||
nt|petergill: NS playing upside down count|pg||
pc|h5|nt|arno11: Iris Grümm has always been a member of the austrian ladies team in recent years, Stefan is a former junior internationalist, both in their late twenties|pg||
nt|athene: maybe south thought his partner showed two hearts rather than four|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hK|nt|rv: this rates to be 1 down, can NS manoeur a @c ruff as well, now unlikely|pg||
nt|mdgraham: defence will get a spade ruff, but to no avail|pg||
nt|athene: no way to beat this - east could start with the spade lead but then if he tried underleading the club for a second ruff he would be sadly disappointed|pg||
nt|athene: i don't think you want to offer clubs with a minimum 5422|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed but east took a normal view i think|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you cant stand a 2D response and a huge chunk of your stuff is in their suit -- a defensive hand-type when they open 1S really|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Oh well, they are getting too many trump tricks now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We all agree re the double|pg||
nt|petergill: Nice play of heart to ten|pg||
nt|arno11: EW are Iris Grümm and Stefan Jerolitsch both in their late twenties, Iris is a steady competitor for the austrian ladies team and Stefan is a former junior internationalist|pg||
nt|arno11: I guess NS are of the same age, maybe even younger|pg||
nt|vugraphzqn: N-S 26,28...|pg||
nt|petergill: Is South Ben Handley-Pritchard? If so, he used to play in England Junior (U26) team about 8 years ago |pg||
nt|arno11: http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=3308   Iris|pg||
nt|vugraphzqn: yes scrote i Ben Handley_pritchard|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|nt|tomi2: As far as I remember this Consus squad won Australian Nationals earlier this year|pg||
nt|henryb:  At this vulnerability, I think you either have to look for slam or defend|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I agree- prospects of 6@C probably remote|pg||
nt|athene: and 5@C is very rarely going to be better than 3nt|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.pzbs.pl/wyniki/turnieje/2010/pula/team/pulateamleaderb.html  for running scores|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
nt|roswolf: but with 4 cards in the other major not too yucky|pg||
nt|marlowepi: both red is the worst conditions for this double -- both sides might go down in hundreds|pg||
nt|arno11: http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=13996 Stefan|pg||
nt|petergill: NS team name is "She Goes to Bed at 8pm"|pg||
pc|cK|nt|Walddk2: There is a first time for everything, all 4 commentators agree|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.msc.com.pl/cezar/index.php?s=&mycl=0&tmt=5&p=21&r=5739&s_r=0&s_nz=nowicki&s_off=0  for a picture of Nowicki|pg||
nt|athene: if north actually had a diamond ruff coming, and four hearts, it might be sensible to show THREE hearts|pg||
nt|athene: then there's no chance south will try to give a heart ruff rather than a diamond ruff|pg||
pc|d8|nt|vugraphpl2: spodziewana dyskusja|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
pc|s8|pc|c6|pg||
nt|Walddk2: yes, and not "bad" :)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|henryb:  I do not think they can beat this|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d7|pc|d2|pg||
nt|henryb:  especially with partners who are not particular about distribution when making takeout doubles|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe she is too|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|henryb:  But declarer can go down|pg||
nt|jbgood: well, another heart now|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup and probably has|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|rv: yes, I have seen it happen too often in my stints on BBO Vugraph, the more we have lesser the chance we all agree:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And now club, then 2 down|pg||
pc|cT|nt|roswolf: definitely has|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|arno11: http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=3464   Ben|pg||
nt|xenya: I think She Goes To Bed... is a motley team, consisting of players from Croatia, England and France |pg||
pc|h4|pc|h9|nt|othered1: Some prefer to bid their shapes out rather than just rebid 3N on 5-4-2-2- hands.  Matter of style, but not unheard of.|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|d5|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s7|nt|jbgood: he would have maed it by ruffing a di, then another spade. If N ruffs in, the di loser goes away|pg||
nt|jbgood: or a club loser|pg||
nt|henryb:  Should have taken his 10 tricks: three side winners, five trumps in hand and two club ruffs|pg||
pc|d6|nt|marlowepi: i rarely even agree with myself, let alone three other commentators|pg||
nt|athene: you might bid this way with a really concentrated 5-4 but here with the ace outside, it feels like a balanced hand to me|pg||
nt|vugraphzqn: N sad something about reading Es book....befor start...:)|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.crobridge.com/pula/eng/  for the festival website|pg||
pc|dT|nt|roswolf: probably will cost a couple of imps|pg||
pc|d3|nt|jbgood: but to get the five trump tricks in hand he needed to play another spade from dummy|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dA|pg||
pc|h8|nt|henryb:  North needed to return the @dJ, not the trump|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|sT|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|xenya: all under 29, i've been told|pg||

nt|roswolf: perhaps|pg||
nt|roswolf: did someone pull out a plug?rehi all|pg||
nt|roswolf: this might get feisty|pg||
nt|fabsayc: bidding strongly suggested 4 hearts with declarer where not possible|pg||
nt|Walddk2: E-W play Blue Team Club, a rare bid nowadays|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Did you play that ever, Peter?|pg||
nt|petergill: When Ben H-P played in the England junior team in 2002 at Torquay for the European Junior Championships, Ben's partner Richard Probst met his Croatian wife Sandra (Kulovic?). Both ...|pg||
nt|petergill: Ben and Richard were very humorous and witty when I met them at that event. |pg||
nt|Walddk2: *bird I meant to say|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: suits aren splitting friendly in this hand|pg||
nt|athene: most people would open the north hand 1@S - 2@S is ok if that's what it shows|pg||
nt|othered1: that's a normal result, if east doesn't make the non-restricted choice decision had north played @SJ on second round.|pg||
nt|athene: well, people treat 6-4 as a 1-suiter, sometimes|pg||
nt|arno11: EW are using a kind of Blue Club system, so strong club  4 card majors and canapé (shorter suit first in some situations)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: how loudly can east pass 1@S?|pg||
mb|1C|an|!|nt|vugraphzqn: ...sry all..lost conection..:(|pg||
nt|roswolf: aggressive opening by north|pg||
nt|peachy: in light opening style, North will open|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@D showing diamonds, a rare bird on this side of the pond|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's as good as anything in my view|pg||
nt|petergill: I played Blue Club for about 2 months. |pg||
nt|arno11: EW are playing canapé style, but only by opener, strong club with control responses by step, kind of BLue CLub|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@C is 17+|pg||
nt|Walddk2: with control responses I assume|pg||
nt|arno11: as iti is still played in Austria but becoming less popular|pg||
mb|d|an|!|nt|athene: if they bid 6@S (unlikely) west had better keep his fingers off that @DA|pg||
nt|fabsayc: EW probably make 6@D, but will they get there|pg||
nt|arno11: W will bid 1@H |pg||
nt|petergill: Ben H-P in his youth used not to like to pass against a strong 1@C |pg||
mb|1H|an|!|nt|mdgraham: not uncommon in England, maybe in places like Norway where they like Ekren |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Also after double?|pg||
nt|petergill: Still the same |pg||
nt|arno11: showing FG less than 3 controls (ace= 3 king=2)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You gain 2 steps after an overcall|pg||
mb|4H|nt|henryb:  Must not have weak 2 available|pg||
nt|rv: 3rd seat pre-empt can be wide ranging for most partnerships|pg||
nt|athene: a very surprising pass from east - i would have thought it was simply a choice between double and 2@H (i woudl double)|pg||
nt|athene: if you play Lebensohl then 3@S is forcing (with an invitational hand south would bid 2nt then 3@S)|pg||
nt|arno11: 1@H is 11-16, 4+ cards can have 4 cards+ a longer suit that´s why alerted|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=3308  Iris Grümm, pretty young woman|pg||
nt|athene: it's always very tough, when one person has shortage in his partner's first-bid suit, to find out whether there are wasted values there|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so this is blue team ew then, arno?|pg||
nt|arno11: 2@D 9 cards in both directions so could be 4@H 5@D or the other way round|pg||
nt|Walddk2: pass and redouble|pg||
nt|arno11: also after dbl, XX wld show 5-7 with clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: South does not double because 1@C is artificial.|pg||
nt|roswolf: a weak 2 is very strong by today's standards|pg||
nt|marlowepi: double?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ah|pg||
nt|mdgraham: oops|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, thousands play Multi|pg||
nt|peachy: Or some polish versions, or Ekren's etc.|pg||
nt|athene: ouch|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, all you can say here is that South thought 3@S was forcing and North didn't|pg||
nt|vugraphzqn: I think some misunderstand here...S look angry...|pg||
nt|petergill: Dbl will be some sort of two suiter, perhaps hearts and a minor ( I guess) |pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: very disciplined pass over 1@s by East|pg||
nt|athene: i think north might have thought they didn't play lebenshl here|pg||
nt|athene: there is less reason for it after you double 2@D|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.pzbs.pl/wyniki/turnieje/2010/pula/team/pulateam2leaderb.html  for running scores|pg||
nt|athene: because mostly with a weak hand you are bidding 2major|pg||
nt|arno11: yes Martin at least as far as I know :)|pg||
nt|athene: now when west doesn't cue 4@H, that is music to east's ears|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Blue Club is only alive in Austria I think. Fischer-Saurer also play it, don't they?|pg||
nt|petergill: Astro or Aspro over the strong club|pg||
mb|5D|nt|roswolf: dont like the 1nt - i would double having both majors|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2NT may show good clubs |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphpl2: ale klotni nie ma atmosfera dalej ok|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: i think a polish 1@C should be assumed to be natural-ish and defend accordingly|pg||
nt|athene: there's such a fine line between "disciplined" and "wet" :)|pg||
nt|athene: 2nt is just natural by the look of it|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes. You might not like 2@H, but double is possible|pg||
nt|peachy: If playing sound overcalls, E suit is not good enough.  Opposite passed partner, I think it is just conservative, not quite "wet"|pg||
nt|athene: south might just bid 3nt now anyway|pg||
nt|athene: those tens and nines are all quite nice|pg||
nt|mdgraham: wouldn't mind double|pg||
nt|athene: ok, maybe she doesn't like music :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|arno11: Fischer Saurer are playing 5 card majors and strong 1@C|pg||
nt|arno11: pass 0-4, 1@D 5-7|pg||
pc|sA|nt|roswolf: dont understand east's pass over 4@S|pg||
nt|arno11: the austrian ladies pairs are mostly playing Blue Club, so anyone can play with anyone|pg||
nt|fabsayc: here the second/fourth lead tells declarer club finesse working|pg||
nt|vugraphzqn: 2/4 leads|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.pzbs.pl/wyniki/turnieje/2010/pula/team/pulateam2leaderb.html  for running scores|pg||
nt|athene: well, unless it's a singleton lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 96 teams were divided into 24 groups of 4. Three rounds of qualifying, and then Swiss|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is Swiss 3, last match today|pg||
nt|peachy: with such distributional hands, club could easily be singleton|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6 more tomorrow|pg||
nt|athene: the Poles lead differently from everyone else from most suit combinations, but they have to follow the rest of the world with a singleton :)|pg||
nt|arno11: forgot Fucik and Purkarthofer and wife and husband Terraneo (Franz + Sylvia) who played Blue-Club for Austria in Ostend|pg||
nt|petergill: EW are lucky that they aren't overboard. |pg||
nt|petergill: Dble of 4@H would have yielded - let me add it up on a trump lead |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Did you say Ace = 3    king = 2   Arno?   In that case they are not playing "normal" responses, zz  as played by Nyström-Bertheau rather where ace = 3   king = 2   queen = 1     zz|pg||
pc|s5|nt|brolucius: Yes.|pg||
nt|rv: not sure if X meant anything specific, possibly East felt he had unstated strength|pg||
pc|s9|nt|peachy: West's choices for opening lead, difficult|pg||
nt|athene: no way to beat this - declarer will just plot away at the clubs|pg||
nt|athene: *plod away|pg||
nt|fabsayc: do they lead singleton?|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|tomi2: dont know what systems they use, but Martnes is fan of a system with very weak openings w/r and strong club while vulnerable he prefers to play natural openings|pg||
nt|athene: with @HAK @CAK off the hand declarer knows he needs a certain amount of good fortune, but it's all forthcoming|pg||
nt|Walddk2: With the left hand. Nice gadget|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Don't you all do that?|pg||
nt|arno11: dbl wld have netted 800|pg||
nt|arno11: sry ace 2 king 1 |pg||
nt|Walddk2: ok then|pg||
nt|petergill: -5 would be 1100 but I think declarer might have escaped for only 800 in 4@HX|pg||
nt|petergill: Ben Handley - Pritchard was recently the npc of the Croatian Ladies team at Ostend in the Euro Championships |pg||
pc|c5|pc|cA|nt|vugraphpl2: gosia miala obawy ze singlowa wziela|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|pg||
nt|peachy: grr :)|pg||
nt|arno11: http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=3308    Iris Grümm|pg||
nt|athene: i guess you try to set up the spades|pg||
nt|fabsayc: left handed people don't|pg||
nt|athene: using the clubs as entry to dummy|pg||
nt|arno11: http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=13996    and her partner :)|pg||
nt|athene: playing the @CJ at trick 1 might have been a deceptive move in case the lead was a singleton - south might not be able to read it|pg||
nt|athene: but it does mean you can't get two club entries to dummy|pg||
nt|athene: if north is sufficiently well-read to insert the king on the @C5 lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.pzbs.pl/wyniki/turnieje/2010/pula/team/pulateam2leaderb.html  for running scores|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6 matches of 8 boards today|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Finishing late tonight European time|pg||
nt|arno11: how big will group A be in the end?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|brolucius: North-South have sold out too cheaply, really. They have half the points and a 4-4 spade fit.|pg||
nt|jbgood: a steal for sure|pg||
nt|rv: not best defense|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|Walddk2: Maybe Tomislav knows|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: if the defence had attacked hearts right from the start they would be threatening to set up east's long heart before declarer got the clubs going, but south could change plans and ...|pg||
nt|athene: go for the diamonds and spades - with both finesses working he would have nine tricks without any clubs|pg||
nt|arno11: now 28 teams, but will be less in the end|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|petergill: One reason that people bid a lot nowadays is that opponents often do not take the penalties on offer - with a fairly balanced hand (i.e. no singleton nor void), West might have ...|pg||
nt|petergill: doubled 4@H|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|tomi2: this hand seems to be the reason.|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d5|pc|h6|pg||
nt|athene: but with a solid 5-5 trump fit you aren't usually all that worried about entries|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The last 3 rounds will be Danish where two teams can meet more than once|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dT|nt|vugraphpl2: gajcyk wypytuje o sekwencje zrzutek|pg||
pc|dK|nt|rv: East's X should have possibly enabled West to defend hand more accurately, he knew partner has most of unseen values|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i guess it was a pealty double of 3H. unlucky they ran|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 10@H right, @dK right |pg||
nt|athene: and the @SQ|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|peachy: everything right :)|pg||
nt|athene: finessing looks like the best play here|pg||
nt|peachy: while he is  thinking:   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Istria.png  Pula is located by the beautiful Adriatic Sea|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this is the sort of hand the opposition always make aganst you - off course you go about two off|pg||
nt|athene: there are some layouts where it would be wrong but nothing like as many|pg||
pc|s7|nt|roswolf: yes that is why double was better - the flexible friend|pg||
pc|s4|nt|jbgood: they would have to fight over 3 clubs then - not easy|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|athene: ok, perhaps declarer decided that west would not lead from @SQxxx - so he either has five, or he doesn't have the queen|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|athene: if he has @SQxxxx and no entry you are safe to rise @SA|pg||
pc|c8|pc|h2|pc|cK|nt|vugraphpl2: deklaracja ale tylko 9 lew |pg||
nt|vugraphpl2: moj bl¹d|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.pzbs.pl/wyniki/turnieje/2010/pula/team/pulateamleaderb.html  for running scores|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|henryb:  Since E-W make 3@c and can beat 3@s, what's the signicant difference?|pg||
nt|roswolf: DID this really happen?|pg||
nt|rv: East's X ideally should be t/o of @s with max of pre-empt, doesn't make sense to show "I have good and lots of @hs"|pg||
pc|c9|nt|jbgood: and only one down ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmmmmmmmmm|pg||
pc|h3|nt|athene: there was another consideration - he might think that west wouldn't give him a working spade finesse he couldn't take for himself|pg||
nt|athene: but still, there is a use for it |pg||
pc|h5|pg||
mc|12|nt|roswolf: not a lot in truth at imps|pg||
nt|arno11: as far as I saw it´s danish even now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Known as Monrad in Denmark|pg||
