mb|2D|nt|mcphee: ok @C lead for sure now|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|mcphee: oddly both major slams make due to a friendly lie|pg||
nt|mcphee: I doubt they will play a major|pg||
nt|mcphee: although Q alone in @H is not shabby support opposite a 6 card suit|pg||
nt|bmkl: N knows the @d fit|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|mcphee: now @D have been set|pg||

nt|panosk: by E-W of course|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|alati: lucky @s game, with @s 2-2, @d 3-3 and 19 points in the two hands|pg||
nt|panosk: 4h for E-W|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|alati: or easier 3nt |pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|d|nt|panosk: yes exactly rite so same contract in both tables|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|nt|panosk: that wud be a killing swing though|pg||
nt|alati: here there was a misunderstanding in the other room, but have in mind that Mimis and Filipos play  together for 1st time today|pg||
mb|p|nt|panosk: they overhear you Alex|pg||
mb|p|nt|alati: @s 3-3, @hJ falling, any slam in a major is on... but 6@d not|pg||
pc|c2|nt|eleni: abd a par score|pg||
nt|oliverc: 6@D doomed to failure here if EW find the @C lead (which they surely will now)|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cK|nt|panosk: declarer will ruff a diamond in dummy and collect his 10 tricks|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|alati: S must keep @Ds Q@h and @sA |pg||
pc|cA|pc|d4|nt|eleni: open table also played 3@s if the posted results are correct|pg||

pc|dK|nt|eleni: a tight maych|pg||
nt|panosk: the K&R evaluator gave South's last hand a value of (.6 points|pg||
nt|panosk: sorry 9.6|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d7|nt|oliverc: Difficult to bid to a 7-card fit Major suit slam once the 9-card @D fit found|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|mcphee: zaleski needs to find 8 or more imps this hand|pg||

nt|mcphee: 4@S not so fine|pg||
