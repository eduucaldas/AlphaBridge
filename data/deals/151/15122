nt|sharkey: About as far North and South in Norway as possible|pg||
nt|sharkey: good morning Mike|pg||
nt|haans: with amurder|pg||
nt|haans: 3@H did the trick|pg||
nt|chick: pretty brave 3N with only Qxx|pg||
pc|s9|nt|lestergold: and to u too Carl|pg||
nt|lestergold: well a tame defence may let this thru|pg||
nt|chick: ouch, and N rescues them|pg||
nt|haans: but ...|pg||
nt|jaheim: hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 3@C of course, partner should have both minors|pg||
nt|pelu: but pass is not an option by N - 2@S?|pg||
nt|frankaus: the scorer is the cheif scorer for the Aust BF  - has done an excelent job|pg||
nt|npcjpn: looks like pass forces redouble.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: greetings everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome Gary|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Hi Gary|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Steve :) great to see you|pg||
nt|kastan88: good morning /good afternoon Gary from estonia|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|sharkey: East elected to bid NV - not unexpected|pg||
nt|lestergold: cant blame south for making the obvious lead|pg||
nt|haans: or not|pg||
pc|sK|nt|haans: 1@D no 5 c M|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello all and welcome.|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Certainly better than this|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@S first time - but now N sh have 10+ |pg||
nt|iceblue: 2@D is woolsey,|pg||
nt|npcjpn: at least NS got the game so far.|pg||
nt|kaz08833: NS reached correct contract|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Martin and Tom are two of our leading players altho Reid usually plays with Newell|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: early coffee hand here :)|pg||
nt|kastan88: coffee hand or not, let's bet how many tricks?|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|lestergold: i must admit that as south i would chance a double here i like to earn imps|pg||
nt|jaheim: NS  won the mixed pair chship this year|pg||
nt|mcarroll: and adopting the trend towards 5 rather than 6 card suit|pg||
nt|jaheim: lots of toppairs playing 2 @D as a weak muli   and 2 @H @S as a serious weak 2|pg||
nt|kastan88: fight for partscore, after club lead and spade switch would be -1, West will getting spade ruff. Now just made.|pg||
nt|iceblue: 1 major|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|marlowepi: presumably S cannot open 2H, but a more likely alternative would seem to be 1H. cant argue with success though:)|pg||
nt|chick: Pass by S is also an alternative :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: very odd to bid 4H when 3N is virtually sure to go down|pg||
nt|frankaus: we are too lazy (or drunk) to look to see if the suns out :)|pg||
nt|kastan88: no more troubels for EW,  every partscore (1NT, 2@H doubled) probably -4 for them and -800|pg||
nt|kaz08833: easy 10 tricks, maybe 11|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Korea 11th NZ 10th at this stage|pg||
pc|s4|nt|sharkey: I see 8 tricks?|pg||
nt|lestergold: nom heart ruff but an immediate diamond swirtch and force will be uncomfortabelm fro declarer|pg||
nt|haans: slam possible :)|pg||
nt|april7: very aggressive bid by E|pg||
nt|jaheim: 2 @D   prob   1 major|pg||
nt|april7: @S lead would be good,then down|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 2@H Doubled would have been interesting|pg||
nt|jaheim: ............  and expensive|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/2b44yyj  for results and standings after round 12 of 14|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/2b44yyj  for results and standings before the last round|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@C should lead to a rapid sign-off from East|pg||
nt|rv: I presume Kushari's splinter is limited, Laltu (East's nickname) did have couple of useful cards, but poor @s suit must have decided to lie low|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: would 2@HX be more pleasant for N?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jaheim: tydligvis en xy nt i sving|pg||
nt|jaheim: ø har vist en invitthånd med 5 + spar|pg||
nt|lestergold: wehn the lord deals you jt9xx of trumps, he meant you to double|pg||
nt|othered1: 25 HCP and stopped at 2@S.  East's psyche had something to do with it.|pg||

nt|rv: Laltu will play safe and end up making 12 tricks here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Remember the Goon Show? Neddy Seagoon: "Gosh, the Sun's hot" Bluebottle: "Then you shouldn't touch it"   |pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Velkommen tilbake|pg||
nt|haans: why 4@H?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Mercifully undoubled|pg||
nt|pelu: even after pass in 1. seat N sh have an A more!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Nobu, please tell us about the Japanese ladies. Have they been regulars in the team for long?|pg||
nt|npcjpn: This EW pair has been played together for a long time.|pg||

nt|h_karluk: http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=3649  Sun Ming|pg||
nt|iceblue: vs str 1NT, 2@D is ok for me,|pg||
nt|bucheister: no good lead by N she might try a heart; certainly a spadewill not beat this|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: this should be beaten a trick, unless something odd happens|pg||
pc|hK|nt|haans: i prefer 1@H to 3|pg||
nt|chick: with 2 aces and 3 hearts, N must know that 3N is doomed.   must be he thought 4@H was makeable|pg||
nt|haans: true|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in that case why wouldnt he bid it on the porevious round?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: surely E was not going to pass 3HX|pg||
nt|frankaus: fairly transparent singleton lead |pg||
nt|rv: He will hop with @DA, pitch @c on @CK, draw trumps and concede a @d|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: in fact by 2, if def get club ruff|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes and 3@D makes easily|pg||
pc|h6|nt|haans: Results?|pg||
nt|chick: 3@HX is better than 4@H|pg||
nt|baardolav: Hello|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Looks like 11 tricks|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 9 tops|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: no overs|pg||
nt|kastan88: or to try for @D finesse now?|pg||
nt|kastan88: and some overs|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: doesnt need it|pg||
pc|h4|nt|Walddk4: Hey LM|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|sharkey: Ser ut som 9 stikk|pg||
nt|haans: 1@D no 5 card M|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: back in few minutes, must restart|pg||
nt|april7: it doesn't matter what S plays if the continuTION IS OK|pg||
nt|kastan88: Singapore is on 6th place, Bahrain on 16th place (19 countries participating)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|haans: poor believer|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Baard Olav Aasan|pg||
nt|baardolav: Hello all|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello all and welcome back |pg||
nt|kastan88: why not, if hearts 4-2?|pg||
pc|h3|nt|npcjpn: In open room, South did not enter, so 1NT was the contract.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: you win :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: could test @H first|pg||
nt|kastan88: 11 tricks,|pg||
pc|hA|nt|Walddk4: Jan Arne, Carl og vores operatør, Liv-Marit|pg||
nt|lestergold: if they find the doubhkle in the other room you are in for a massive loss |pg||
nt|jaheim: and  bronze medals  in the mixed team |pg||
nt|haans: other matches?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/2b44yyj  for results and standings after round 4|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: no worries here|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and Mike Graham|pg||
nt|april7: loks like only 1 down because of stiff Q of @S|pg||
nt|bucheister: at favorable vul I like 3S and many experts would open 3S even at NV|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: away goes the ruff|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|sharkey: Needed a @H lead from S - hardly to be expected I think|pg||
nt|haans: but may make Jt9 in @D = good|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Good morning all|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Indeed. The system I tend to use is that the Double of 2@D indicates that I was going to transfer to @Hs|pg||
nt|jaheim: EW  currently 2.   NS 4. place|pg||
nt|mcarroll: S thinking, 2 shows an honour, so it has to be either A or Ten, |pg||
pc|h9|nt|vugraphznb: EW are brothers|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this contract does not look to be in danger|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/2b44yyj  for results and standings after round 10 of 14|pg||
nt|jaheim: hi   BOA|pg||
nt|kastan88: still down, needed to play 1st trumps|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: well, defence have now missed their opportunity for that ruff|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: danger of too many tricks|pg||
pc|d6|nt|lestergold: the play for a ruff iss too slow and north has no entry now to play diamonds so this will make after all|pg||
nt|jaheim: 1. of all    tks to our exelent operator Liv Marit Grude,    and congrat.   with silver medal in the Junior ( baby?)  chship|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|npcjpn: The other pair in open room is relatively new partnership.|pg||
nt|frankaus: we can also see the result fron each board from every table|pg||
pc|h7|nt|marlowepi: certainly true that Pass is an option for S. my comment about 1H was based on the manifest intention of S to do something other than the textbook pass, so i whould have prefaced my ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: remark with "given that S wanted to be active here...,"|pg||
nt|jaheim: :)|pg||

nt|kastan88: 2@H doubled depends from opening lead, with @S or @D lead even may be -3 or -2 only|pg||
nt|kastan88: @SK and @HQ both laying right, so possible is 6@D, but rather, who bids that|pg||

mb|1N|nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/2b44yyj  for results and standings after round 3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: certainly there are hands where 3N could make and 4HX be a good save -- mostly they start with a longish minor lacking only the ace plus two heart stoppers and enough spade tricks ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: to get to nine. but it is extremely pessimistic to save since there are zillions of hands where 3N fails, maybe by several tricks. so if you don;t try for that kind of good result ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: when your preempt creates the opportunity, you ought to stop  preempoting|pg||
nt|davidstern: Irashaimase Nobu|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i doubt, why not @c, but may mean different in their sys|pg||
nt|iceblue: 1@D is another choice|pg||
nt|kastan88: not safety to try hearts 1st, then @DQ may be in South hand, and you cant give away @D safety.. problems with entries, and of course South could have @SK|pg||
mb|2C|nt|sharkey: vi ligger litt foran :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: Yes - problem was S was on lead - likely to favor declarer|pg||
nt|haans: we will not get abid fron West|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Sorry, missed a few rounds as I had to get the phone|pg||
nt|april7: might end up in 4@S by NS or 5@H by EW|pg||
nt|npcjpn: but only 3 teams in womens, Australia, New Zealand and Japan.|pg||
nt|frankaus: do we open as south ?|pg||
nt|iceblue: they are playing prec|pg||
nt|h_karluk: what's 1@c range?|pg||
nt|kaz08833: neither sids has game but it's likely some kind of disasters may happen on this one|pg||
nt|kastan88: depending of course, that strong hand playing 2@H, but not easy to reach there|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes must be their style, if N had kept 1@H there would be no finesse at the end|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: that is an opener for some these days :(|pg||
nt|bucheister: Hi I am John Buchheister and will commenting on this match in the closed room|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: or will we?|pg||
nt|haans: assume X is penalty|pg||
nt|haans: weak openings make it harder for opps to bid their cards|pg||
nt|frankaus: we are resorting to betting on two flies here - no-one knows how to rigg that contest|pg||
nt|rv: 3rd pre-empts are GOK, can be very weak to near opening hand esp at this vul|pg||
nt|xenya: i would|pg||
nt|frankaus: Y for me|pg||
nt|othered1: NS playing Precision, I presume?|pg||
nt|iceblue: too poor suit for 2@C|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: they are not an established partnership, but as this team is self funded, are together|pg||
nt|kastan88: for me too, we are quite crazy here in Estonia|pg||
mb|2H|nt|jaheim: will end up in 4 @H|pg||

nt|rv: Laltu's raise is a bit dangerous especially if partner is allowed to bid weak 2s with wide ranging hands|pg||
nt|kastan88: last was about previous board, of course|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: NS in trouble now|pg||
nt|npcjpn: brave 4NT oppsite passed partner.|pg||
nt|kaz08833: because of 1st success N might be too high.. 4NT is a little bit overbid|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thx for joining us John|pg||
mb|p|nt|kastan88: me too, always|pg||
nt|xenya: why not|pg||
nt|iceblue: yes, prec with 14-16 1NT|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I think 2@D is strong balanced|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: lol|pg||
nt|bucheister: Hi Gary; I think we have done this before|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: but alerted|pg||
nt|mcarroll: May have lost the @S suit now|pg||
nt|jaheim: so the winner of this match will win the tournament|pg||
nt|npcjpn: Quite impressive!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Do they play an invitational sequence after the 1NT rebid I wonder|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Seems like it|pg||
nt|dslee: NS should collect|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I'll bet this double isn't penalty, though|pg||
nt|coolvijay: 5@d on the cards on the finesse of @d q|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: minors or 2 suiter|pg||
nt|kastan88: 3NT must be some preemptive raise in both majors, if they play multi?|pg||
nt|kastan88: or onli strong 2@D?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 2@D 3 way multi 3NT 4-4 majors pass or correct|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Our matches tomorrow are China v Singapore (women), Pakistan v Indonesia (open), and Indonesia v Japan (women) |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: indeed we have|pg||
mb|2N|nt|sharkey: 3@C nå fra N?|pg||

nt|lestergold: i dont really understand the defence the play for the ruff wsd pstently hopeless when a forcing game had obviousn prospects|pg||
nt|sharkey: Kib points out @D9 a better lead with actual holding|pg||
nt|lestergold: coffee break hand 4 easy peasy @h|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good morning to Ed Shapiro|pg||
nt|davidstern: He was the third from the right|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 2@C forcing 2@D, then 3@S? Invitational with 6|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Probably not since East is thinking|pg||
nt|dslee: 3@H now|pg||
nt|xenya: more interestingly, do we overcall as W?|pg||
nt|othered1: 41S is really pushy, since almost nobody requires extras for a 1@S free bid nowadays|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Good morning, everybody, from overcast central Pennsylvania, USA|pg||
nt|jaheim: D  is prob  3 @H|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: lol|pg||
nt|mdgraham: bet it shows 13 cards, some of them pictures|pg||
nt|rv: NS not sure of their agreements here possibly, I presume North took South's X as responsive|pg||
nt|dslee: the hint N has to take is that his ptr might not have a 4 card M|pg||
nt|rv: in modern expert methods, I presume South should pass and collect undoubled if North can't double again|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 9 tricks could be made here as cards lie|pg||
mb|3N|nt|sharkey: S ikely to try the 10 here |pg||
nt|haans: good bidding |pg||
nt|mcarroll: Tricky contract|pg||
nt|davidstern: 4@S is a little unlucky oonb this hand with two diamond ruffs and the spade offside|pg||
nt|mdgraham: one possibility was to start with 2@H over 2@D, but you can understand the double  |pg||
nt|kaz08833: 5@c will go down, probably 2|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: which should come home with 3S, 3D, a heart and 2 clubs, even if defence find best start of a heart|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaheim: evt   2 nt|pg||
nt|sharkey: Det var vel alternativet|pg||
nt|jaheim: valgte kløvern, hadde fortjent å finne makker med omvendt minorfarger   imo|pg||
nt|sharkey: God strategi å sette press på motstanderne i gunstig sone|pg||
nt|jaheim: 2 @H  prob  shoving 3 + @H|pg||
nt|april7: best is to cash 2 top @D and then playing @C ace and @C|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: 3@H should make on the nose|pg||
nt|davidstern: 3@H last making spot|pg||
nt|frankaus: real tough to find the right strain and level on this 1|pg||
nt|dslee: 2@H is better bid from N|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and now NS are swinging across the line|pg||
nt|rv: I will fault South's double here more than North's first double|pg||
nt|mdgraham: to be fair, this is a very awkward hand for NS|pg||
nt|frankaus: my choice would bre 3NT after the X by N|pg||
nt|bucheister: E has to bid 5H|pg||
nt|h_karluk: it sounds modified prec there|pg||
nt|othered1: Yes, east can't presume a canape overcall . . . |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: which they didn't|pg||
nt|kastan88: mostly coz 4-card @S in my hand, with 3 or less spades I would pass|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 11 opp 8 whatever|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: :(|pg||
nt|haans: if they make 1NTx they do not get game |pg||
nt|chick: 4@H looks good superficially, but I think difficult to make.  3@S has no chance.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: we can see that spade intervention might make this tricky, but the chance for that has gone|pg||
nt|kastan88: with trump lead just lot of down|pg||
nt|kaz08833: S is an expert dummy player and he might take 10 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: technically 4@s is a vbiablem save but who is gonna bid it it could be heading for 800 not agood imnvestment unless you cansee al the cards|pg||
nt|jaheim: S is prob. very tired,  a "old"  (59)  lady playing every day since last friday|pg||
nt|sharkey: hi everyone|pg||
nt|chick: Hi Carl|pg||
nt|pelu: u were right with 3@s :)|pg||
nt|rv: South should either pass (my choice) or bid 3n|pg||
nt|mdgraham: looks like they will get to 4@H|pg||
nt|frankaus: when in doubt ........... bid 3NT ......... Hamman|pg||
nt|iceblue: @C lead would set it|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|sharkey: hi Cornelia|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Interesting lead. With no entry to the @Ss and with a limited auction, trying to find partners strength|pg||
nt|rnmalik: indeed. @SJ would have been interesting.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Absolutely|pg||
nt|baardolav: should make even if all the "quesses" goes wrong|pg||
nt|april7: S has to play Q of @H or small @H from dummy to make this contract,because S will not guess stiff K of @C|pg||

nt|Walddk4: This is basically the same|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The hands fit nicxely and game is easy|pg||
nt|super nova: Some people like to play 8 ever 9 never|pg||
nt|bucheister: I am not sure; but we will find out|pg||
nt|kastan88: another case here what to do with West hand, if partner opens with  light 1@C|pg||
nt|bucheister: Gary there has been an amazing turn around competing against 1nt openings; years ago you very seldom jumped in the auction; now with any excuse|pg||
pc|h6|nt|sharkey: Da burde vel ikke Pd ha x første gang?|pg||
nt|henryb:  I would love to know how East made 6N|pg||
nt|haans: Hi Ed|pg||
nt|henryb:  Hello Hans, Ed|pg||
nt|haans: Hi Henry|pg||
nt|baardolav: 3@s is a better bid than 3@h|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Well, maybe not easy|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.pabf2010.co.nz/Participants/Convention-Cards/Women/Japan.aspx|pg||
nt|super nova: hence not to take the @d finesse|pg||
nt|frankaus: a "round" 12 is not everybody's idea to open - but A + 2K  hard to pass |pg||
pc|h3|nt|haans: kib: GRASSHOPI: I'd have preferred X to 3@D me: and then what|pg||
nt|npcjpn: even @HQ wasted, I am surprised Asbi's pass over 2@s.|pg||
nt|iceblue: She got it|pg||
nt|kastan88: after such bidding, sure, needed trump lead|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|frankaus: this has a play IMO|pg||
nt|mdgraham: credit the 2@D opening with making NS work|pg||
nt|h_karluk: mainly there are 5 opening bids in the precision system : 1@c 18+, 1@d 10+, 1@h 10+ w 5cm @h, 11s same, 1N 15-17 (th important point dont bid if u ve 14-18)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mdgraham: looks like they are getitng there.|pg||
nt|frankaus: c!Q well placed|pg||
nt|frankaus: @CQ|pg||
nt|rv: this contract can make since @CQ well placed and both @hs and @cs breaking|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: bd 1 an exact push|pg||
pc|d8|nt|coolvijay: true|pg||
nt|super nova: however when a 6 card spade suit is shown the odds tend to favor the fineese so |pg||
nt|super nova: should make in theory.|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|othered1: easy plus for NS, even though you might score a bit more in @S|pg||
nt|chick: perhaps, but I don't like to bid a weak 2 in first seat with such a nice major holding spades here|pg||
nt|pelu: I see a loser in 4 suits :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: system info courtesy of Nick Jacob who is in the audience :)|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|haans: no not a perfect |pg||
nt|othered1: For my style, the @D suit is two higher honors short.|pg||
nt|chick: especially diamonds, which rarely has much preempt value|pg||
nt|h_karluk: do i remember right Ice?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|sharkey: Looks like Mr. Voll has lots of work to do here|pg||

nt|Walddk4: If not, a heart goes away on a club|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: in this case, makes the @S hook odds on :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: board 1 a swish neither side could find the slim game|pg||

pc|hK|nt|haans: assume he played well :)|pg||
nt|haans: on target|pg||
nt|chick: bingo|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Interesting, N will probably play J @Cs to try to get an entry to dummy, if W ducks may be held to 8|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ok modified variants|pg||
nt|npcjpn: on this hand, 4NT worked poorly, but if partner holds East hand...|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|lestergold: old lady! excuse my wife is 59 in a few weeks and she is still in first flush of youth|pg||
pc|h2|nt|chick: N could have safely led a heart at trick 2, and saved one club ruff, but S is doing it for him|pg||
nt|sharkey: and S will ruff the potential @D trick|pg||
nt|baardolav: David Ueland west Daniel east|pg||
nt|april7: @D @D ruff|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: 4@H only 5 +1 again|pg||
mb|4H|nt|sharkey: Must be "GARBAGE Mulki"...|pg||
nt|jaheim: 2 @D   very weaak multi|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/2b44yyj  for results and standings after round 5|pg||
nt|sharkey: Liv Marit our excellent operator confirms down 2|pg||
nt|davidstern: 2@D/3@D NS or 2@S EW|pg||
nt|rv: somemay bid sandwithch 1n here from Laltu's hand to show other 2 suits|pg||
nt|mdgraham: thank you, thinks West|pg||
nt|frankaus: some call it a smelly hand -  4711|pg||
nt|h_karluk: then the question east wld x or not, probably wld also pass|pg||
nt|iceblue: i think W mb ruff with @HQ instead of @H8|pg||
nt|bucheister: or two.  doesn't N make a heart anda spade?|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Spørs om NS kan få med seg @H stikkene her|pg||
nt|haans: no support x|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2D is the obvious call but it has the disadvantage of letting W bid hearts cheaply|pg||
nt|marlowepi: good hand for transfers faci ng overcalkls|pg||
nt|mcarroll: W passed?|pg||
nt|april7: W should have opened the bidding|pg||
nt|jaheim: My money is on "Filosofene"   any sidebets   ?  :)|pg||
nt|frankaus: after the brand of perfume|pg||
nt|h_karluk: swish|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i mean i expect a swish|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 1@h AP|pg||
nt|npcjpn: what is the meaning is South doubles 2@d?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: prefer 2@H N natural and promising @D support for me|pg||
nt|kaz08833: I agree pass is percentage judge after pd's pass |pg||
nt|npcjpn: good @D or good hand with 3@h.|pg||
nt|kaz08833: the contract will be 3@d by NS|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: or 3@S by W|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: @C systems handle east's hand easily.  But if you're willing to open the correct 1@D, standard shouldn't have a huge problem, either.|pg||
nt|pelu: 5@d make but diff to bid|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our match in round 4 will be India v Sri Lanka (open)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I saw the opening bid in this hand in the OR where S opened NT x by W and I am here:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello all |pg||
mb|5C|nt|sharkey: *Multi|pg||
nt|lestergold: festering awful wouldnt do it myself at equal vul|pg||
nt|lestergold: here it might make e/w auction difficult|pg||
nt|sharkey: Can't be distributional values either....|pg||
nt|april7: then K of @S extracts last trum, should play @C to hand and the @H|pg||
nt|jaheim: 4 @D from Aabye ?|pg||
nt|april7: now 1NT pass pass pass |pg||
nt|davidstern: Not a fan of the pass by W - I would prefer to bid 2@C to let partner know I have values else I will be under pressure later|pg||
nt|rv: I presume Kushari-Laltu play 1n here to show 16-18, hence Laltu Xed instead of 1@s on account of much better @c suit |pg||
nt|mdgraham: there is a school of thought that 1N sandwich should simply be a strong NT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: given the dross people open and respond on these days |pg||
nt|frankaus: red V green its risky to geet too excited|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but in my book passed hand|pg||
nt|bucheister: brb|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 's 11 t/o x fine|pg||
mb|d|nt|sharkey: Ø dukker en @S og NS må ta beiten på direkten|pg||
nt|chick: it looked same to me, but we trust our operator :)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: E hates this hand!!|pg||
nt|davidstern: We likely have 50% + of the points and partner doesnt know it|pg||
nt|davidstern: 2@D by E???|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: will be by S|pg||
nt|pelu: oh - I didn't exp that|pg||
nt|rv: he should pass here, not enough to bid once more esp with some short suit values|pg||
nt|frankaus: red card will apper now|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: but west has a monster over east's bidding so should go on|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh well im really getti9ng a full dose of commentatr's curse today|pg||
nt|sharkey: Whar would you bid Mike?|pg||
nt|lestergold: west's pass verylazy in my view and suicidal in a teams game|pg||
nt|lestergold: im 61 this month and feel about 18 mentally- er physically notm quite that|pg||
nt|baardolav: 2@d is a weak multi|pg||
nt|davidstern: Methinks too|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East might bid agin, but if he has bid his hand with double then he has a clear pass chez moi|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hi all|pg||
nt|h_karluk: would u x as E Ed?|pg||
nt|kaz08833: 3@s is very ill judge|pg||
nt|kastan88: why not 3@S from west?, or even 4s?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hi Shirley welcome|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaheim: K of cl and a claim?|pg||
nt|haans: Big Club at its best|pg||
nt|baardolav: this will make +2 or something|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if 2@d is a Multi, South can respond 2@h (pass/correct) or 2@S (pass/3@h). His hearts are good, could easily have bid 2@s   |pg||
nt|mdgraham: South with long hearts assumes his partner has spades :)|pg||
nt|baardolav: 2@s is natural not forcing in weak multi|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you can play it that way.|pg||
nt|npcjpn: wow! pass with void?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: At least they can take it 1 down|pg||
nt|iceblue: N misunderstood the DBL|pg||
nt|pelu: looks like NS is not so experient|pg||
nt|mdgraham: now 3@D from West?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the NT range is 14-17, most 14's and some 17's|pg||
nt|kastan88: but sure, there wasn't more  possibilities for West to bid after 2@D, as only 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: headed for game not making perhaps|pg||
nt|chick: this can make 4@H but not 5@C|pg||
nt|rnmalik: lesser evil and pass by E.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Pas probably limits the damage as any EW contract would be pretty expensive|pg||
nt|mcarroll: @S slam can make, but unlikely to be bid|pg||
nt|mcarroll: an aggressive lead which on this layout costs a trick|pg||
nt|rv: yes I agree Laltu should have 2 shown suits with more shape earlier with sandwitch NT or Mich or pass now|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 3@S seems a perfect making spot|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: no idea why South bothered to remove 1NT to 2D ..her hand looks "no-trumpy" to me|pg||
pc|hK|nt|haans: i have stopped bidding 4@H 30 years ago|pg||
nt|haans: support x better than delayed support|pg||
nt|npcjpn: may be great score in matchpoint.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: oh, North|pg||
nt|frankaus: saved|pg||
nt|iceblue: anyone agree with this DBL?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: not |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 4 makes on the trump hook|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: nor the choice of lead|pg||
nt|kastan88: ok, new board, I am too Post Mortimer :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello all welcome|pg||
pc|h5|nt|lestergold: i would bid something - choice between 4n and 5H not easy but i would fera missing slam to much not to make a try|pg||
nt|sharkey: @CJ Jan Arne - and claim :)|pg||
nt|othered1: I personally prefer to use a 2@C rebid after 1@D opening to show a good hand. Gives you room to explore below 3N, at a cost on some natural auctions on lesser hands.|pg||
nt|chick: wow, I would never sell out with S's hand|pg||
nt|sharkey: shud be off 1|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello Hamdi  welcome |pg||
nt|h_karluk: all natural and i think 2@s would be a wise choice|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Hi Shirley , thanks|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: and while 2@S will play ok here, if it got a hideous trump break it would be way off|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|jaheim: mm  |pg||
nt|Walddk4: But 100 is not much compensation for a missed game|pg||
nt|mdgraham: how can double be anything but penalty?|pg||
nt|frankaus: N cant beleive pd pass a penn X with 3@S|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: same no tricks and -5 now|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|h_karluk: the difference now is @d4/3 but @s 5/2|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but i wld choose x as east with passed hand's 11 fine|pg||
nt|kaz08833: watching all hands we know EW can make even 4@s but I will surely pass 3@D with E's hand and gain small plus|pg||
pc|s9|nt|sharkey: Ø spiller @SK først - ofte "æerlig" fordeling da|pg||
nt|haans: was strong in KS|pg||
nt|haans: 2@C|pg||
nt|othered1: That's my preferred natural system :)|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|haans: @H lead much better than low spade|pg||
nt|npcjpn: dbl by West show @H and some @s?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But can they make 5@C?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: would u also pass as East Ice?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the 3N was weakish prepared to play game opp a weak major|pg||
pc|sA|nt|jaheim: mm   5 @D  -1|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5@d can lose spade heart and @d 3n very vulnerable too|pg||
nt|sharkey: Agree - think he shud fight with 3@H|pg||
nt|april7: depends on the play,W might lose 1 @S,1@H 2@D and 1 @C|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 5@D I mean|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I wonder if South put the spades down first....|pg||
nt|iceblue: yes, i would pass, since of RED :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: then most probably 1@h allowed, maybe same thing yr p wld think even with less hcp and 1@h would buy|pg||
nt|iceblue: how about 2@D xx?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: double part score = +6 Japan its teams|pg||
nt|kaz08833: this is a kind of "alarm clock".. if S had stiff @h S shd play @DA at trick one|pg||
nt|kaz08833: playing @DK denies stiff @H|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Macau I mean|pg||
nt|kastan88: after 1@S overcall and inviting 2@D (spade support) from East, I think EW never stopping before 3@S (if opps fighting with 3@D), but sure such decision is problem of style|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 7 imps thx Tommy|pg||
pc|s5|nt|frankaus: they have agreed @H so X cant be t/o|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|jaheim: ja   og ender opp med 2 bet |pg||
nt|h_karluk: sounds a desire to play there, a tad ambitious|pg||
pc|c2|nt|npcjpn: on a club guess, I think.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: such things are good enough to save the say whenever there's a misfit and not big points|pg||
pc|hT|nt|lestergold: perfectly reasonable as games make on dim finesse|pg||
nt|jaheim: needs a sp lead to win, i think|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n can make dpending on defence 5@d no play at all|pg||
nt|lestergold: except on spade lead|pg||
nt|rv: N-S not clear about their competitive methods, clearly evident from first 2 deals|pg||
nt|h_karluk: sorry, i meant to save the day|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome to John Bucheister |pg||
nt|bucheister: hi:  I am John Buchheister from the USA;, Michigan to be precise|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Hello John|pg||
nt|h_karluk: greetings from SC to MI, i hope printed yr state well|pg||
pc|cK|nt|haans: :(|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Would you x NT after first x by W and pass by E?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: W showed the other two suits by x.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I think I would find the Pass, but I also think being aggressive is a winner in the long term|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|lestergold: very little info from auction west has opted for non commital 'safe' trump lead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: however, they have also stopped at the two-level, so double is not needed as any sort of competitive effort|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s6|nt|lestergold: spade switch obvious but doesnt matter spade loser cannot go|pg||
pc|s7|nt|mcarroll: AKx trumps lead would have made this a struggle for declarer|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: mm make 5 now|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|davidstern: Four rounfs of hearts would have been best|pg||
nt|othered1: Meanwhile, 2@H is going to play nicely.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: in the other room for NZ we have Michael Ware (NZ top masterpoint winner of all time) with new pard GeO Tislevol ex Norway|pg||
pc|h2|nt|othered1: At least it simplified the auction.  In standard, south's planned rebid after opening 1@D isn't easy.|pg||
nt|april7: @H switch might cause  aproblem|pg||
pc|c7|nt|jaheim: minst|pg||
pc|h8|nt|baardolav: you have to... else you will sit on 5-1 heart playing with 7-2 in spade|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good morning to Cornelia Yoder|pg||
nt|chick: Hello Everyone :)|pg||
nt|jaheim: HI|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|jaheim: ø i store problemer på neste hj|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and when you have vulnerable opps by the short and curlies (so to speak), you want to twist them  |pg||
pc|d4|nt|haans: biggest problem with 4@H is that you need 10 tricks|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi Cornelia|pg||
pc|d3|nt|kiwibridge: Michael has his own system CRUNCH used to great effect at the top level in the Australian top teams events|pg||
pc|dK|nt|sharkey: Skvisen kommer|pg||
nt|frankaus: turned a large plus into a wash |pg||
nt|Walddk4: This is the last match today. Tomorrow we have Sri Lanka v China, New Zealand v Chinese Taipei, and Singapore v Australia, all from the open series|pg||
nt|bucheister: Do NS play precision?|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|kastan88: while bidding seems game on 4-3 hearts fit quite possible, but bad trump break just finishes that dream|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: NZ-CT that should be a cracker|pg||
nt|bucheister: hello everyone|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: there was a big earthquake in Christchurch at 4.30 this morning, 7.1 lots of damage but no reported deaths|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|haans: holy ...|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Declare has 6 tricks and now setting up the 7th|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 3@S was meant as values with no good bid and that is what I think it should be|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sharkey: fremdeles 2 bet|pg||
pc|d6|nt|rv: huge let-off for India here, couple of free-hits missed by SL:)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Lead of 10 of @C by N would have been interesting. |pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|haans: nothing wrong with playing simple|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: yeah, C-T currently right up near the top|pg||
nt|bucheister: I lived thru one of those in LA; no fun at all|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: not sure of their system, the operators here tend not to alert anything|pg||
pc|s2|nt|marlowepi: did S really rebid the diamonds all on his own?|pg||
nt|npcjpn: no @c discard?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Shui was not on that wavelength|pg||
nt|dslee: sorry folks back again|pg||
pc|c9|nt|kastan88: Do they play that with Tislevoll too?|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|kiwibridge: easy game as they say|pg||

nt|chick: not sure which table it is|pg||
nt|april7: 10 of @H was important|pg||
nt|xenya: 4@H turned out to be an unlucky choice it seems -- don't think 4@S EW is likely to make|pg||
pc|h3|pc|cT|pg||
nt|haans: urkkkkkkkkkk|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|othered1: If trumps had split less well, it would be playing a lot less nicely.|pg||
nt|bucheister: 2D doubled must have been systemic and I cannot understand the bid by S; EW had no where to go and no where to hide|pg||
nt|kastan88: Yamada-san, sure right, East cant bid more by LOTT, really, he had shown all|pg||
pc|c5|nt|jaheim: hm   no sidebets,  not even a beer in Lillehammer next year  :)|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d8|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is not an easy hand to play in 4/3 |pg||
nt|h_karluk: yes, the auction went natural and somehow W neglected to pick 5/2 @s|pg||
pc|h4|pc|c4|nt|h_karluk: i believe E did his best to describe the hand|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: plus for NZ here|pg||
pc|h9|nt|kiwi_joker: having missguessed what to do on the spade exit by Susan H, decl now in big trouble. EW would have liked their opps to be vully here  :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: this will be costly v OR|pg||

nt|Walddk4: How to gain 2 IMPs|pg||
nt|dslee: ahh|pg||
nt|frankaus: peter hall's book competative bidding at pairs has an excellent chapter on competative doubles - i highly recomend it|pg||
nt|bucheister: are they playing a club system?|pg||
nt|sybarra: I do not think so |pg||
nt|h_karluk: i am not sure, just joined and 1st time working abt their teams, but i guess after a few boards we'll reach the truth|pg||
nt|super nova: 6-5 keep it alive.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Slam time.|pg||
nt|othered1: South's pass, at least as I play it, would have been accepting 2@DXX.  That could be tense|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: indeed it was|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznb: weak multi or strong|pg||
nt|haans: Voll right thats a weak 2|pg||
nt|chick: we all know better than to bet with you, Jan :)|pg||
nt|jaheim: :)|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: I prefer 2@S (spades and a minor, 6-10) to 1@S,here, but it is close, very close|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I think so Jaak, he's been playing with Matt McManus in the top Aussie events|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: so an unlucky -9 for a good sacrifice|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: may keep NS out of the cold @D slam|pg||
nt|april7: just 11 tricks possible, but depends on the lead and continuation|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 4@S with 10 or 11 tricks depending on the lead|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 11 on a diamond lead|pg||
nt|frankaus: takes the guesswork out of these situation|pg||
nt|bucheister: the meckwell two heart response is very useful on this type of hand|pg||
nt|rnmalik: What do we have from E, 2@H?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: coffee hand :)|pg||
nt|frankaus: g'day all|pg||
nt|bucheister: It looks like 4H would make; losing 1S;1H;1D|pg||
mb|1C|nt|sharkey: Depends on what x of 2@D would mean|pg||
nt|jaheim: 1 nt 4 minors|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: 1NT is 8-15 p and at least 4-4 in @c and @d|pg||

nt|kaz08833: LOTT tells E not to bid at 3-level but his @C holding breaks LOTT rules, thats why I dont blame 3@S by E|pg||
nt|kastan88: but brave wolf's breast is fat|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: welcome Frank|pg||

nt|sybarra: there are 15 teams participating in the event|pg||
mb|2C|nt|lestergold: well this slam wont be missed thats for sure|pg||
nt|othered1: South's double is interesting with that shape and not that many high cards|pg||
nt|haans: odd take out x|pg||
nt|henryb:  Going back to board one, where Lunna mysteriously took 12 tricks in 6N, shouldn't it be possible for big club players to reach 6@c?|pg||
nt|othered1: North has to act h ere and EW may find themselves defending a high @D contract|pg||
nt|haans: big clubs does anything :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: in board 1, Lunna got a diamond in the lead, and South was endplayed in spade|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I suppose it depends on what you open 2@d on - if you can do it with 5@h, then yes, 2@S natural makes sense |pg||
nt|davidstern: Spade partial ERW and Hearts or clubs NS|pg||
nt|pelu: I would never open in East - would u?|pg||
nt|sybarra: Singapore currently in 6th place|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I now have the Reid_Jacob system card thanks Nick :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: Kvarngraven 1st to think were are all the cards|pg||
nt|sybarra: at +17 imps|pg||
nt|h_karluk: http://www.bridgeguys.com/Conventions/MeckWellEscapes.html|pg||
nt|sybarra: Palestine, with -53 imps, is in 13th place, but there are several segments remaining and opportunities for plenty of movement in the standings|pg||
mb|2N|nt|jaheim: ja   hadde gått 2 bet jeg|pg||
nt|jaheim: minst  :)|pg||
nt|jaheim: another slam coming up|pg||
nt|sharkey: 18-19|pg||
nt|lestergold: whether they bid the grand tho is open to question|pg||
nt|othered1: I might rebid @H on south's hand and I think it wins over the long term.|pg||
nt|haans: with u|pg||
nt|marlowepi: some would use stayman as N|pg||
nt|april7: should S open and N passes then E will come in in @H and then  perhaps 1,2,3 NT???|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Obviously the dealing machine is saving the games and slams for later in the tournament ...|pg||
nt|davidstern: Spade lead and heart off dummy would work well for declarer|pg||
nt|Walddk4: No|pg||
nt|pelu: give up: 4@s|pg||
nt|rv: E-W pair play rebid of 2M after 2/1 to be catch-all|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2NT forcing - very sensible|pg||
nt|rv: they play 2/1 as GF|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thx Rashed my friend and Hi Jamie :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: wanghong should pass to 2@h, whatever vulnerability she see|pg||
nt|npcjpn: not coffee hand, depends on a club guess.|pg||
nt|bucheister: Hi Shirley; I did not realize you had joined us|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: hm that will tend to ruole out a heart contract|pg||
nt|sharkey: Kib asked why not open weak 2@H with S hand on Bd 17.  Reason is weak 2 openings 3rd hand NV can be very weak at Expert level, and this was closer to an opening hand.  Also a ...|pg||
nt|sharkey: matter of agreement|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Ah this may get them to the bad game|pg||
nt|frankaus: was the pd of Aust best player ever  (tim seres)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes, and another 6 to Australia on board 3 ambitious game failed OR|pg||
mb|3C|nt|sharkey: tror de fleste av oss hadde det|pg||
nt|jaheim: Viego in trbl,  but 1400 in the "bank"|pg||
nt|Walddk4: If you open with a sub-minimum in 3rd seat, fair enough, at least have a decent suit|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I dont know, but thought with 2@H bid by E, EW would be in 6@S.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i mean 2@d xx|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: interesting their 1N must have a 4 card major in it|pg||
nt|kastan88: Most problem for me, that can't find nowhere in internet participant CC's|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaheim: NS are playing in my local club|pg||
nt|lestergold: anymore and someone will be in tgrouble|pg||
nt|haans: ty Liv needed that info|pg||
nt|henryb:  Did South really have to act over 1@s Hans?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think many of us would begin with 1@D as W dealer|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Seres is a legend|pg||
nt|frankaus: david lilley played many years with ron klinger|pg||
mb|3D|nt|sharkey: 7@C makes|pg||
nt|chick: I think that hand is much too strong for a preempt|pg||
nt|mdgraham: dbl looks like DONT  - six card suit somewhere. Bit thin if it is|pg||
nt|npcjpn: there are many players who does not like pass in 3rd seat even vulnerable (in Japan).|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: I don't think W should pass 1@D, has 5 P!!! and then 4@H would have been reached making 5 if starts with @S finesse but 10 tricks for sure|pg||
nt|april7: down from top on @S lead|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I would rather open 1@H if you forced me to open|pg||
nt|npcjpn: me too.|pg||
nt|pelu: pest and colera :)|pg||
nt|kastan88: it's possible to win 6@D on EW-line, another is to bid that, and sure, need to find good break in trumps and right finesse in spades, too much key-cards off to bid that|pg||
nt|super nova: I dont like to bid micheals with 'intermediate' hands. because they can be hard to describe.|pg||
nt|kaz08833: or depends on defense.. the problem is when EW find @D shift|pg||
mb|3H|nt|sharkey: Gjetter spillet går ut|pg||
nt|haans: nope|pg||
nt|chick: If I get support for either suit, I don't play a 6-5 hand below game|pg||
nt|bucheister: 4H seems to be an impatient bid; don't you agree?|pg||
nt|bucheister: prbably take 8 tricks on defense|pg||
nt|h_karluk: it wld b a nightmare for EW|pg||
nt|iceblue: sun bids 4@S directly after 2NT better|pg||
nt|kastan88: may be somewhere in older tournament archives...|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: RDK one of the all time greats also|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: lol I welcomed Shirley earlier John :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: 7N has 13 tops |pg||
nt|lestergold: n /s in trouble !|pg||
nt|haans: to good effect|pg||
nt|pelu: can West pass?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: one of the legacies of the old Acol system was that 2NT here was not forcing|pg||
nt|rv: Kushari will sign-off in 3N to limit hand|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/25udavr  for running scores |pg||
nt|sybarra: seems so John |pg||
nt|h_karluk: absolutely, even i can tell misunderstanding of fast arrival concept|pg||
nt|bucheister: if E bids 2D, W will bid 3D and E can bid 3NT|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i guess A count, K attitude there|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so the defenders would have no difficulty to cash 2@d, 1@c and a trump|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but let's wait and see, who knows there may be a slip in defense|pg||
mb|3N|nt|frankaus: scoring looks to be done by martin wilcox cheif scorer for ABF |pg||
nt|dslee: now laltu might force a round?|pg||
nt|bucheister: I went to get some liquid refreshment and missed it|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaheim: y   but no D   |pg||
nt|mdgraham: ok, we don't want 1100|pg||
nt|baardolav: no one can ask for aces...|pg||
nt|pelu: plauge or colera, sorry :)|pg||
nt|pelu: plague - new keyboard :(:(|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this was because when someone opened the bidding, you could never be certain that they had an opening bid|pg||
nt|super nova: I like to stick with Weak or Strong Micheal and bid the medium hands naturally.|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaheim: her måtte sp K ut|pg||
nt|jaheim: y   13 toptricks,  with 2 sptricks|pg||
nt|haans: dirty bridge|pg||
nt|bucheister: made us all wonder?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the auction was tortuous what was W looking for?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: I tend to agree|pg||
nt|rv: Laltu's 4N is Quant|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh my,  made 4 in other room |pg||
nt|h_karluk: unfortunately true|pg||
nt|sybarra: south cashed a @D, then led a hts |pg||
nt|h_karluk: why i do not have such defenders, i think i am a jealous guy :)|pg||
nt|iceblue: @DQ is the killing lead|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so far so good layout|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and the lead friendly neighbor, no worries|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lestergold: 7N is technically better as well because if clubs broke badly you would have the spade position to fall back on|pg||
nt|sharkey: 7@S depending on the @S finesse|pg||
nt|april7: but after ruff S is endplayed|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so you had to have lots of bids that acted as invites. Partner bid on if he really did have an opening bid, and passed otherwise|pg||
nt|rv: Kushari would have accepted Inv to slam with max (13-14) for his stated minimum (10-14)|pg||
nt|kaz08833: now the time to @D shift but it's rather tough|pg||
nt|kastan88: now will work signals for defense, how good they are|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: right I concede @C guess :( sorry|pg||
nt|bucheister: 1nt-3nt|pg||
pc|h7|nt|haans: would have gone on if after 2nt invite|pg||
nt|haans: bridge not like all time|pg||
nt|haans: old|pg||
nt|mcarroll: The last thing Declarer will do is lead trumps, has to try for a semi-crossruff in the red suits|pg||
nt|mdgraham: important to know what these doubles are. After the redouble, penalty is a live possibility|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: EW not agree about bidding|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: back later .. bye all|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: this 3@S figures to fail also|pg||
nt|kastan88: immediate diamond play now, expassing later @DA|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mcarroll: well stopped|pg||
nt|baardolav: or south can not...|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: it is precision I'm told|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|jaheim: tull   kl Q er jo inntak  :(|pg||
nt|lestergold: funnt south doubles and east can probably manage 3@s they bid on to hopeless 4@d and let off hook|pg||
nt|othered1: right, south has a quite sound opening|pg||
pc|c5|nt|jaheim: y   think cl is trumph|pg||
nt|sharkey: The @S suit has not been mentioned so a mute point|pg||
nt|lestergold: well bid at any raTE ITS GOOD ENUF AT IMPS|pg||
nt|mdgraham: maybe West didn't believe East could have a penalty double of 2@H when he held @HKJ|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Now only 10, no entry to dummy to take the diamond finesse when spades are 3-1|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Declarer got a diamond lead in the other room|pg||
nt|kaz08833: E chose safe defense but lost plus score|pg||
nt|npcjpn: now time for buying a cup of coffee.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: to clarify: the NT must have a 4 card major IF if the lower range|pg||
nt|kastan88: small @D to J|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|sharkey: Wonder what wud happen if Jensen opened Multi 2@D here (ref previous board)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|henryb:  I thought this was perhaps a Scandinavian requirement: see 11HCP, Pass not allowed :)|pg||
nt|othered1: Is that tap enough to beat it?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: forcing defense there, early ruffed|pg||
nt|h_karluk: counting|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: but NZ +4 on board 3|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: GeO in 1N making |pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|c4|nt|haans: greast lover of T and 9|pg||
nt|sharkey: 4@H a make here?|pg||
nt|npcjpn: East in the other room also opened!|pg||
nt|super nova: Hard to describe in terms of playing tricks.|pg||
nt|kastan88: if @H8, was switch to somewhere... probably East could switch to dia|pg||
pc|c9|nt|lestergold: i do not understand my pard vul opens bidding i sit over strong hand with that trump holding they at 4 level im sorry folks i wer bring out a red card pdq|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Alright the other route is x 1@H and make 6.|pg||
nt|xenya: @S lead looked reasonable -- and would have been a killer|pg||
pc|cT|nt|mcarroll: best defence is to continue trumps but not easy from K9|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: W did jump to game, E could make a move|pg||
nt|rnmalik: or bid 1@S and @D later on........................|pg||
nt|h_karluk: no way to set it|pg||
pc|s5|pg||

nt|april7: @C would be better,because E might have 3@C|pg||
nt|h_karluk: only @dQ as ice described|pg||
nt|iceblue: dummy would be SQZed|pg||
nt|iceblue: seems -1 now|pg||
nt|othered1: but north can't make it from here|pg||
nt|iceblue: Sun Shud have played @SQ 1st instead of @SA|pg||

pc|c7|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Too tough for me|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the 3 level bids were a bit of wasted space|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lestergold: is there a law against it|pg||
pc|sA|nt|othered1: why @S pitch and not @D on their @C?  If no trump shift, then crossruff high|pg||
nt|kastan88: this time spade lead would take down, but usually I don't like such lead from poor doubleton into dummy's suit|pg||
nt|othered1: still time to tap declarer with another @C|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sharkey: Moysian fit|pg||
nt|npcjpn: 7 tricks for push.|pg||
nt|kastan88: but wasn't easy|pg||

pc|s3|pc|s6|pc|sQ|pg||

nt|april7: 3@H p  p  X  p 4@S|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Sound reasonable to me|pg||
nt|april7: on @H lead then 5,on @D ace lead only 4,but bidding might develop differently|pg||

nt|haans: Henry :)|pg||
nt|haans: no alert of 2nt?|pg||
nt|henryb:  1@s would seem to have the advantage that it leaves more room, and your hand is better than a weak jump overcall|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: 2NT was bid as good-bad, but W is not sure. TD at the table|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: 2NT was not alerted|pg||
nt|haans: can be costly|pg||
nt|henryb:  on either side?|pg||
nt|haans: for EW|pg||
nt|henryb:  the alet I mean?|pg||
nt|baardolav: they did not play that hand...|pg||
nt|april7: N did not reopen|pg||
nt|chick: now, S has shown his 20 with a X then cuebid|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if 2@c asks for a four-card major, West should reply 2@D|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, but i don't think a passive lead was indicated on the auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: on the  lead of @CA and a @C?|pg||
nt|sharkey: 500 if axed|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/2b44yyj  for results and standings after round 7|pg||
nt|rv: hand is too strong for 1n in my opiniom, I expect Rubens-Kaplan calculator to indicate atleast  18 hcp for West hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: off to the races is my guess |pg||
nt|bucheister: N really bid the spots off those cards|pg||
nt|othered1: withthe west hand?  Depends on agreed style.|pg||
nt|kastan88: for me last hand signalling easy: odd (@H7) says come on with hearts; even high (@H8) says: switch to hearts, even small (@H2) switch to clubs. But sure you always have not such ...|pg||
nt|kastan88: good spot cards|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: oops spoke too soon|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: best for South top say no more|pg||
nt|haans: to|pg||
nt|april7: tu|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: board 26 now, 25 later|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Ah that explains it|pg||
nt|baardolav: is this right?|pg||
nt|april7: tough game here!!!!|pg||
nt|baardolav: the biddings i mean?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Ms Kobayashi likes to open light it seems|pg||
nt|mdgraham: as he hasn't got a four-card major|pg||
nt|kastan88: 4@S for EW (and best is to play that from West hand). Now after @H lead just disaster|pg||
nt|h_karluk: now now|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: N trying to escape from the hole he created|pg||
nt|kaz08833: NS have only 9 top tricks and make much efforts to take 10th|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: superb player Martin is even this may test him|pg||
nt|kastan88: hmm, isn't 3@C forcing here? IMO 4@H too fast|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes far too fast/unthinking for me|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: WebCam: http://tinyurl.com/2bj3dm or full adress : http://bridgefestival.no/modules.php?name=NukeWrap&page=http://bridgefestival.no/refresh.htm|pg||
nt|rnmalik: favourable placement of cards for 4@S.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: At least this resembles an opening hand|pg||
nt|pelu: strange lead when u know that pd has max 2 @hs|pg||
nt|npcjpn: I do not play against this pair so often, so I don't know their style.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: dangerous seas for NS|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Steph should make this without much trouble|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: she'll worry that if the trump King is offside, she is in danger of going off (@D ruff)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes but no choice of trump play|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: she also has a lot of losers to 'do' something with. Throw them on spades, looks appealing.. but entries and maintaining control are important|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|lestergold: 9 claimable immediate tricks|pg||
nt|sharkey: In my view an awful convention - tell opps your distribution|pg||
nt|haans: no alert = good hand = 3@S good bid = missed game|pg||
nt|h_karluk: not an easy grand decision but its there|pg||
nt|bucheister: should be able to pass 1nt opposite a passed hand with the S cards|pg||
nt|sybarra: and a good stop here also|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jaheim: men meds gammelmakkern som sitter på hjørnet hadde det nok blitt 2 kl|pg||
nt|frankaus: too stong 4 me |pg||
nt|mdgraham: imho, 1NT is a complete distortion|pg||
nt|rv: I would have opened 1@h and rebid 2n with Kushari's hand|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes|pg||
nt|sybarra: grand doesnt make on the lay out |pg||
nt|frankaus: they must be playing michaels = anty strenght|pg||
nt|npcjpn: If North open this hand, South must invite with 4NT, but this is a new partnership..|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: flat 30's very seldom make 12 tricks ergo necessary to have full opening values when vul|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: chance to duck|pg||
pc|s6|nt|jaheim: kløver eller en sterk hand|pg||
nt|sharkey: hadde funket bra denne gang - unntatt hvis ikke @D forsvinner...|pg||
nt|sharkey: 2 x @D og ruff ut @CK|pg||
nt|sharkey: sry - ingen inngang|pg||
nt|npcjpn: @h7 at trick one is interesting..|pg||
nt|pelu: but @Hs not :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridgeunlimited.com/bridge/ViewMasterEvent2?code=10ASIA&header=pabf|pg||
nt|pelu: @HA|pg||
nt|rv: no harm done on this deal though|pg||
nt|sybarra: but 6 should be ok |pg||
nt|h_karluk: immediate pass by Nancy would be good|pg||
nt|iceblue: 2NT=choose minors pls|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 6 direct winners at 2N defense|pg||
nt|kastan88: and of course playing with spot trumps showing is that signal real (high trump spot 1st if possible)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes better, lucky here to escape a minor suit lead|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|jaheim: looks like im loosing my sidebet,  Liv Marit|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: :)|pg||
nt|bucheister: It will make but 6NT is much better|pg||
nt|h_karluk: kind of double dummy, @c K hook onside|pg||
nt|bucheister: partner is a passed hand and you are NV with no defense outside hearts; sounds like a 2H bid|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lestergold: a lot ofm tricks here for declarfer|pg||
nt|frankaus: 36 zars = 18 HCP|pg||
nt|frankaus: many do these days|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the sight of dummy won't bring joy, helpful sort of lead|pg||
pc|h3|nt|sharkey: Med @S 3-3 ordner det seg i den fargen|pg||
nt|sharkey: Med @D og @C 3-2 funker det meste - V skal også gardere seg mot @C 4-1|pg||
nt|lestergold: what?|pg||
nt|baardolav: this will be a disaster for NS|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no- saved by hearts 3-3|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jaheim: ikke  enkelt i 5 ruter,  faktisk lettere i 6|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @SK and @CA very friendly:)|pg||
nt|april7: 5 down|pg||
nt|jaheim: 1100  ?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: stiff !q dislike but i do not know p's @c holding, so 1@h fine, i think|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: relief to see that K :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: OR in @S making 6|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 12 to Singapore on 4 as Hans and Nunn go for a number|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|bucheister: well it is 13-10 and this is not Meckwell|pg||
pc|h5|nt|rv: yes I expected hand eval closer to 18 hcp |pg||
nt|iceblue: but i doubt if Sun thinks so too|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 11 points is NOT a vul opener unless partner won't go mad|pg||
pc|h7|nt|jaheim: or 1400|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: good guess|pg||
nt|frankaus: 6 losers 1 too many for my agreements|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|lestergold: i suppose can afford it|pg||
nt|sharkey: @C lead beats it I think|pg||
nt|chick: seems like a good way to tell the opponents your distribution|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: scan every hand ever played with 11 opp 19 I guarantee if you never bid slam you would have a huge plus|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: yes, got the doubleton heart lead from South and play was a breeze|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 3 more NZ on board 4|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|lestergold: ten tricks then|pg||
nt|kastan88: but still ruins, if North continuing @D|pg||
pc|dK|nt|pelu: @H8 and @C to K would be a very nice defense|pg||
nt|xenya: E's raise to 4 looks overaggressive to me -- considering his diamond holding|pg||
nt|frankaus: either E or W has oversreatched|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d7|nt|mcarroll: Yes, the nightmare scenario for declarer is if the EW @Cs were reversed|pg||
nt|mdgraham: even with diamonds coming in, North has only eight tricks, and entries are a problem|pg||
nt|h_karluk: their 9 cards @c fit masked|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|dT|nt|lestergold: agree it seems pretty ugly to me|pg||
nt|h_karluk: would make own hand good|pg||
nt|xenya: or both|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|lestergold: even more tricks goodbye ak @s|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so close to LBW, but let off by the umpire|pg||
nt|bucheister: good to try and preempt over the 1D opening; they lose the minors|pg||
nt|iceblue: W why not plas 2NT?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: they ll cash a @s and a @d|pg||
nt|othered1: Note that they lost th em anyway, despite the 1@H overcall|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Nice. Nothing can beat her now.|pg||
pc|d9|pg||

nt|haans: 2NT did for that reason say any 4 card m|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: S asleep|pg||
pc|s4|nt|sharkey: next...|pg||
nt|frankaus: e seems to have soft values on pd short suits  - no usually a good sign|pg||
pc|sT|nt|baardolav: -5 it will be...?|pg||
nt|rv: India has still not agreed to TRDS|pg||
pc|sA|nt|npcjpn: now 9 tricks.|pg||
nt|bucheister: time to claim 6;|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and i am very sorry, right now checked again, @h 10xxx a barrier for grand|pg||
nt|rnmalik: W should make 8 tricks.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but not doubled|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|hK|nt|henryb:  So declarer now has 9 tricks. He started with 8. Will they give him 10? Stay tuned|pg||
pc|hT|nt|jaheim: mm   bra spilt|pg||
pc|d8|nt|lestergold: its also extremely inaccurate likely to lead to wrong levels missed gamkes when maxi for example|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: this flat hand wuould have been +14 Japan|pg||
pc|c5|nt|april7: 9 is higher than 8:)|pg||
nt|npcjpn: may be only 5, 4NT-1.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Japan could gain 5|pg||
pc|c4|nt|haans: not 5c @H not 4c @S|pg||
nt|april7: now small @D and duck the next @H|pg||
pc|d6|pg||

pc|h4|nt|lestergold: gadget lovers all over the bridge world|pg||
nt|xenya: the auction strongly suggested that @DKQ were not likely to be of great value|pg||
nt|bucheister: do not know the logic of bidding over 2nt; N probably was bidding 3C though|pg||
pc|c3|nt|Walddk4: Heart to the 10 not unreasonable|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|Walddk4: given that clubs are 5-1|pg||

pc|s5|nt|haans: close is just close|pg||
pc|s8|pc|d3|pg||
nt|henryb:  they did but he would not take them|pg||
nt|sharkey: I think S should have Doubled 4@H|pg||
nt|npcjpn: quiet match so far.|pg||
pc|s7|nt|april7: or that way|pg||
pc|s9|pc|c6|nt|kastan88: IMO bad is such weak overcalls, as East made, must be only on 1-suiter. Not easy to find later 44 spades fit, if you have not good agreements |pg||
nt|bucheister: a bid plus is always better than a small minus|pg||
nt|iceblue: I think sun-wang mb misunderstand on this 2NT if Nancey PASSED 2NT|pg||
nt|othered1: I like 3@H.  Not likely to get doubled, and it may keep them from finding a minor, as it did.  Ambiguous openings do have a price tag attached.|pg||

nt|sharkey: or 4@S|pg||
nt|lestergold: that too but game unlikely to be bid in either back suit|pg||
nt|sharkey: 4@S may actually be a better contract|pg||

nt|mcarroll: Hard to see anything except a flat board here|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Lots of bidding in OR|pg||
nt|rnmalik: action hand.|pg||
nt|othered1: And it avoids insulting the opponents . .. |pg||
nt|bucheister: nothing wrong with 3H for sure!|pg||
nt|kaz08833: @H guess is easy at that time ... because W discarded @D.. he cannot have 5-card suit|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Tsukamoto knows what to expext by now; partner has 10-12 points when she opens|pg||

nt|h_karluk: lets check clues, wang might have max. 3@h, no 5 sp, then max 4@s and 10-15 unbal. might have 2@d and long @c, so why not 3@c free bid by Sun, i think it worths when Wang opened|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: S wades into the minefield|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: same contract 1 more light 2 more imps NZ|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Not easy|pg||

nt|h_karluk: but sun might pick a moysian fit idea with her x|pg||
mb|4H|nt|jaheim: 2 hj med 4 kortstøtte,  ja ja, ikke min melding|pg||
nt|sharkey: if East were ready to bid 4@C on 3@D he shud be able to do the same over 2@H|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Hi Martin. |pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@d South African transfer to 4@S....|pg||
nt|xenya: N is worth 3@S now i think|pg||
nt|xenya: but...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 3@h invites auto x|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but nobody dared|pg||
nt|npcjpn: not so bad if EW in the other room makes 4@H.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: may not even X|pg||
nt|frankaus: this will not be pretty|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: this can go -4 not a great dive|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: Hardly|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South really playing with fire here. You suspect 3@s would have been passed out|pg||
nt|jaheim: D   is @H lead|pg||
nt|davidstern: It seems the NS style may be to support immediately with 3 spades but I suspect that the bidding is consistent with 3 spades and six clubs perhaps|pg||
nt|h_karluk: however slam, no heart losers, only a club loser|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: very true, but 2@D with those @S's was a real crime|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: combined 24 points doesnt have to bid game|pg||
nt|jaheim: mm   1 nt opening in W|pg||
nt|chick: at least S didn't draw the fatal (to defenders) club lead by bidding them|pg||
nt|chick: now can N find a heart?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Well Leaped|pg||
nt|rnmalik: agree.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 11 easy tricks with hearts 3-2|pg||
nt|rnmalik: or 3 as suggested by a kib.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: not vul and good lead directing|pg||
nt|super nova: I wouldnt bid 2@d as south.|pg||
nt|kastan88: brave Martin will give that?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: is pass forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  but woud you bid less than game opposite partner's opening 1@s?|pg||
nt|chick: booo|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Good lead.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: For defence.|pg||
nt|chick: pretty skinny GF by S|pg||
nt|npcjpn: 4@d splinter discourages.|pg||
nt|davidstern: North may be aiming for 6@C|pg||
nt|davidstern: which would be playable opposite nothing more than the @SK and @CAQ|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: they wouldn't like the 4@s on the side|pg||
pc|cT|nt|sharkey: Vet ikke hvor N fant doblingen i Åpent Rom?|pg||
nt|sharkey: 5@C makes - not 6...|pg||
nt|henryb:  If 4@d is forcing, I approve, otherwise 5@d seems indicated|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2S was said to be GF\|pg||
nt|chick: if 2@S is GF....|pg||
nt|jaheim: so   10 points  is enough 4 a gf?   strange|pg||
nt|davidstern: Ino may have been better supporting clubs to allow South to better judge the hand|pg||
nt|super nova: More likly to consider 3@d|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: it will merely match the OR :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: oops overboard here|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: but a nice lead|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sharkey: Fant den her og...|pg||
nt|sharkey: I think South's hand is NTish - wud have tried 3@D to make pd bid 3 NT with @D stopper|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes, its frustrating when you find later that you pushed them to a  possibly making game |pg||
nt|april7: @S @S @S the W should discard ace of @C on 3d @D|pg||
nt|davidstern: South should now bid six with the @SK and a singleton heart|pg||
pc|c8|nt|haans: holy ...|pg||
nt|haans: xy Stayman in Sweden we belive that was invented in Denmark long time ago|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Miss Jane pulled most probably Miss Greta would respond|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|chick: agree|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think S should bid 5C over 3D, then he is in position to pass 5D|pg||
nt|henryb:  Suth could not affort Blackwood|pg||
nt|marlowepi: right|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: its a good sac for China to earn 7|pg||
pc|cK|nt|rv: this format is not favorite of many of the purists who prefer k/o matches to decide top placings since this format favors beating weak teams comprehensively|pg||
nt|frankaus: 2@H says pd did u have a decent overcall - pd passes to say no,|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: oh dear not optimum defence :(|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mdgraham: after the 3@D rebid, most players play 3@S as competitive only - they either double or bid 3@H as a game try|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh oh |pg||
nt|bucheister: oops|pg||
nt|h_karluk: this is too high|pg||
nt|sybarra: a bit too much |pg||
pc|dT|nt|haans: 2@D GF|pg||
nt|april7: only hope for E to get in if K or Q of @C|pg||
nt|april7: thats an interesting defence|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes 2 promises a few more values|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|lestergold: as spec pointsn o9ut he has forced himnself to bid 4@c over 3@d by his pard whcih would be overdoing the hand|pg||
nt|april7: W must  pray S having another @H|pg||
nt|Walddk4: some would claim|pg||
nt|npcjpn: no claim yet?|pg||
nt|sybarra: some imps back to palestine most likely |pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think Miss Greta forgot who was the captain|pg||
nt|bucheister: 6C would be a great spot even though it does not make|pg||
nt|bucheister: but probably not nice enough|pg||
nt|sybarra: just have to guess the hts on this lead right?|pg||
pc|h6|nt|kiwibridge: def a coffee hand this one Steve|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mcarroll: But on the bidding W may play S for a singleton @S and |pg||
nt|frankaus: quite a good method IMO|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sharkey: East got the clue he neede|pg||
nt|haans: i agree 5@D not 4@D best bid|pg||
nt|rnmalik: In any case then only NS may be in game or slam.|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|rnmalik: AK@S and @HK pitching 3@Ds and @D finesse and one @C loser.|pg||
nt|april7: 5 of @S = @C entry|pg||
nt|chick: the @S5 should show @C entry|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|sharkey: Ingen overstikk her|pg||
nt|jaheim: ja ja,  NS   tror vel neppe de vinner  5 imps etter å ha betalt ut 750|pg||
nt|sharkey: lol|pg||
nt|haans: 1@S-1n-3@S-p|pg||
nt|haans: 2n|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and it's not a bad idea to keep double for penalties, just in case the opponents have stepped out of tline|pg||
nt|kastan88: ahh, sometimeswe are crazy with light openings in Estonia, but much more correct on later biddings or pushings :) |pg||
pc|h8|pc|hK|nt|h_karluk: i think their conventions are stayman, weak 2, blackwood in prec sys |pg||
nt|h_karluk: just a few classic gadget|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: may lose an imp|pg||
nt|bucheister: yes; I wonder why she did not play the J|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|sybarra: wonder what 5 @D answer was?|pg||
nt|sybarra: was on the right track then....|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: was on the money but fell at the last fence|pg||
pc|c6|nt|mdgraham: South now endplayed|pg||
nt|frankaus: everybody plays the same number of weaker teams|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: it's almost a make now|pg||
nt|kaz08833: now 1 off?|pg||
pc|c7|nt|sybarra: could that have been mixup?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: or 1403 |pg||
pc|d9|nt|mdgraham: best|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Well, she enjoys playing|pg||
nt|npcjpn: only three pitch on diamonds.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Apart from that a valuable contribution by a spec that 3@D being bergen raise could be x by N with all the values and @C suit. |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: opps had 5 / 6 top tricks at the start|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|henryb:  5@d over 3@d would have implied the stiff club|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|lestergold: serious defensive error here no need to inform pard about tyhe diamonds at that stage|pg||
nt|mdgraham: sorry, not really endplayed...|pg||
nt|super nova: I had a sneak peak and they got to play 3h in the other room.|pg||
pc|h7|nt|sybarra: I can hear  the "ugh" even here|pg||
pc|d4|nt|sharkey: N squeezed|pg||
nt|kaz08833: gift from defense|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|h_karluk: :)|pg||
pc|c5|nt|jaheim: k of @D was a mistake,  will prob wni the contract now|pg||
nt|jaheim: well  Farstad is following with low spades|pg||
nt|sybarra: on the club break |pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: yes, North had an opportunity to star ..take @DAce quckly and find spade shift - but didnt|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|mdgraham: but East will play North for @HA|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Raju Tolani|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mdgraham: but playing him for @HJ too|pg||
nt|suketbombi: HI thanks Roland|pg||
nt|suketbombi: Hi all|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|npcjpn: NS will be surprised to gain 11 imps on this board.|pg||
nt|npcjpn: instead of losing.|pg||
pc|sT|nt|april7: should have discarded a @C and now small @H and duck|pg||
nt|april7: now its to late|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and i guess OR wld play same - carbon copy auction|pg||
nt|iceblue: they play Muiderberg, mini Multi-2D|pg||
pc|sK|nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/2b44yyj  for results and standings after round 1|pg||
nt|sharkey: Cornelia points out 6@C is indeed makeable on Bd 18 by setting up @D suit - even on @C lead|pg||

mb|p|nt|rv: Hi Dan|pg||
nt|othered1: HI, Dan!|pg||
nt|djneill:  hi shirley|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: I like to play good-bad 2n here as well from West hand|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|rv: direct bid of 3m will show good hand (good 16/17+) and 55, via 2n to show 55 and lesser hcp|pg||
nt|othered1: They can beat this, I think|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|othered1: I wonder if E has something like lebensohl available?|pg||
nt|rv: West decided to X even with 55 since she has some @c tolerance and sufficient extras|pg||
nt|rv: yes E-W should play some sohl (Leb/Ruben/Rumpel) here|pg||
nt|djneill:  good 2@s bid, made it difficult for E-W to  get to game, maybe West should do more than 3@d here|pg||
nt|othered1: yes, if partner wants to defend 2@S, we figure to be OK|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|nt|othered1: I think west has done well  here, unless she is of the "always reopen" school.  In that case, maybe she should have done more|pg||
nt|djneill:  West has already shown 5@d, not sure what 4@d has to add|pg||
nt|sybarra2: Foo must find green card (pass) I thnk |pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|sybarra2: or not |pg||
nt|rv: I think West is about right for double followed by 3@d|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: east hadn't taken a bid before west bid 4@D.  I think a raise is clear|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra2: can they make this?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|rv: well done, possibly best contract on combined E-W hands|pg||
nt|djneill:  bravo, now time for some enterprising play - if West tries to draw just 2 rounds of trumps South will play the Ace and another and now the @hJ cannot be ruffed out|pg||
nt|djneill:  I don't know Shirley, the @d8 uppercut might make West hook the @dT, what is the best play tho?|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|pc|s4|pg||

pc|d2|pc|d8|pc|dJ|pc|dA|pg||

nt|Walddk4: It is of course against the laws to delay the game unneccessarily|pg||
nt|rv: I prefer ACBL format or initial RR followed by k/o like in World Series, not a big fan of this format|pg||
nt|frankaus: one can still get a "flat pitch" V a weak tem and be disadvantaged though|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 7@c kind of double a battery attitude|pg||
nt|sybarra: am told, by spec wrong answer, thinks n/s play 0314 |pg||
nt|bucheister: Interesting that they took so long to play that hand;  I like to get it over with quickly|pg||
nt|frankaus: 300 looks like a pickup 4 NS |pg||
nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that means they give up to use weak 2 as preempts|pg||
nt|iceblue: 2@D|pg||
nt|bucheister: that might be shortness|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: oh dear painful to watch really :)|pg||

nt|vugraphzrc: ok|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: W opened but Christine and Jenna had no trouble reaching 3N|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: 3NT bid and made looks a good result for NZ, with West sitting over  dummy's only 2 honour cards|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: true|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: misread the scale|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: most of those tiny pluses wiped in one hand|pg||

mb|p|nt|lestergold: ie let him make his own mistakes or no0t as the case may be|pg||

nt|kaz08833: NS can make 6@s?|pg||
mb|1C|nt|lestergold: not provide him with a route map to 9 tricks|pg||
nt|sharkey: Rite - and discrading !K at the end position and keeping 3 x @C may have resulted in a set|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Last board of this segment, interesting hands as reflected by the respective scores, no unwanted swings.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's written black on white|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But maybe she could not see that she had 11 tricks; that's an excuse|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but in 0314 4N>5@c 0-3. 5@d 1-4, 5@h 2 and 5@s 2+ trump Q is not it ?|pg||

nt|iceblue: 2@D=WK 2M|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Tom may get excited|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sharkey: The challenge here is to bid game|pg||
nt|davidstern: South got a heart lead and carelessly ruffed a diamond losing all communication with dummy|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe pulled wrong card out of bidding box|pg||
nt|h_karluk: could be|pg||
nt|ralfwil: the "new" house is built 1932, but they have spent a lot of money to make it "up to date"|pg||

nt|Walddk4: West doubled 1NT, then she doubled 2@D and then she passed 2@S|pg||

nt|kastan88: and fast claim|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaheim: but needs to lead a @D, i think|pg||
nt|lestergold: moral of this session has been when you are dealt a double then double|pg||
nt|sharkey: Why didnt S bid 3 NT?|pg||
nt|haans: invite or not invite that is the question|pg||
nt|haans: 2@H prermpt in my book|pg||
nt|chick: after the X, 2@H shows 8+ in my book :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: last board in this match|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: 2 matches to go|pg||
nt|mcarroll: After I predicted a flat board on 6 I hesitate to say anything here - But............|pg||
nt|jaheim: 1   i think   ,  Liv Marit|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: yes, you're right jaheim|pg||
nt|april7: I think losing at most 2 @S and 2 aces|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: one more match|pg||
nt|h_karluk: you know people didn't much attend even to GNT finals|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.bridgeunlimited.com/bridge/ViewMasterEvent2?code=10ASIA&header=pabf|pg||
nt|sybarra: that is only site I have|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: W overcalled 1@D with his vul 7 count, guess E was provoked|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: so looks like 10 to NZ|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: a bonus indeed|pg||
mb|3N|nt|davidstern: And even then......|pg||
nt|npcjpn: @D to 9.|pg||
nt|npcjpn: East should have @CA instead of @CKJ to bid 3@D.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: agree, and a trump short as well|pg||
nt|frankaus: looks a too round for my liking|pg||
nt|h_karluk: as i inspected $23 each session for open pairs|pg||
nt|bucheister: philly is pricey; the large market next to the Marriott is just great; I could eat there everyday; fresh seafood; pastas; every type of food served in small booth areas at ...|pg||
nt|bucheister: reasonable prices|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i ve never been in Philly but heard there's a great Metro system|pg||
nt|kastan88: undisciplined 2NT IMO|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: AKK is extra in it self|pg||
nt|henryb:  better case at matchpoints|pg||
nt|sharkey: We would all lead @HQ vs 3 NT and set it....|pg||
nt|chick: and I have a known double fit in the majors (assuming a normal takeout double)|pg||
nt|sharkey: I wud bid 2@D to show both M and some points|pg||
nt|haans: yep good for 2@D instead of @H bid|pg||
nt|frankaus: friendly @H layout|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, will make|pg||
nt|othered1: 3@D by whom?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: W|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: claim 12 on the @C hook|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: oh dear bid  OR Blair tells me|pg||
mb|4D|nt|haans: im on Volls side|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Depends what 2NT showed|pg||
nt|bucheister: West|pg||
nt|npcjpn: in open room, West bid 5@d as (probably) a lead-directing, and East thought it creates a forcing pass, I guess.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: if xx was an offer to play 5@DXX S should have grabbed it|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: there has been a fair amountg of no trump avoidance too|pg||
nt|sharkey: May work out ok|pg||
nt|sharkey: 5@C that is|pg||
nt|lestergold: im susrprised that 3n failed in open room|pg||
nt|haans: yes at IMP you seldom pass before game|pg||
nt|chick: that would also work if such agreed|pg||
nt|sharkey: This won't be easy|pg||
nt|mcarroll: True Roland|pg||
nt|mdgraham: NS wil be quite pleased to gain an imp after going four down vulnerable in a freely-bid game |pg||
nt|sybarra: great city and hotel location is right down town, easy to get around|pg||
nt|sybarra: in the other room,   the 2 @S bid led the commentators to suggest taking immediate @H hook agst the j of H!'s|pg||
mb|4H|nt|sharkey: Solves trump problem|pg||
nt|lestergold: well ive checked play first took club the unatural way then after spade switch took a secons spade finesse rather than dim finesse when defenders had warned himn that spades were ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: both 'wrong'|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Well, the cardinal sin, Mike. Declarer had his contract but went for overtricks|pg||
nt|sharkey: Viego will suffer their first defeat |pg||
nt|h_karluk: I liked The Marriot, have been there in many sectionals, regionals|pg||
nt|h_karluk: classy|pg||
nt|super nova: Doesnt promise any points.|pg||
nt|xenya: easy to play too|pg||
nt|frankaus: 10 2 aces  -  red game in the offing  - i would make a game try |pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  if partner signs off the game may be less than 50%|pg||
nt|davidstern: South will switch to a spade at a million miles and hour if East plays another diamond |pg||
nt|pelu: yes KJ no value when pd 5-5 in major|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridgeunlimited.com/bridge/ViewMasterEvent2?code=10ASIA&header=pabf  for results|pg||
nt|pelu: a major Q better than @cK|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: has already denied many :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: x 13-15 or 19+ any|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: i see contract failed in open but surely playing on clubs declarer should make this|pg||
nt|haans: you need a good 50% to bid non vul games|pg||
nt|haans: better bidding than OR|pg||
nt|pelu: ??????????????|pg||
nt|npcjpn: East probably hoped miracle AQ in majors.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Sophia is lucky that this does not cost the contract|pg||
nt|kaz08833: xx = @DK and 5@H = ask for something?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: play for split honours in clubs shoul lose a heart a club and a diamond at most|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Last board for the match. Back in 10-15 mins|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: that would be nice|pg||
pc|sK|nt|sharkey: Had to lead @D9 for a set|pg||

nt|kastan88: *not lost 4@S, just didn't find right 4@S :)|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 2@C should be fine here unless declerer looses 3 @HS 2@CS and @S unlikely|pg||
pc|sA|nt|april7: now almost 4@H|pg||
nt|pelu: but she is almost endplayed |pg||
nt|npcjpn: the other 8 is better to shift.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: She had 3 to choose from :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South may have protected with 2@H, of course|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mcarroll: Extraordinary set, 53 imps in 6 boards - and more to come!!|pg||
nt|kaz08833: both sides did their best.. very good auction by both|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 20-22 maybe|pg||
nt|april7: 1@S and 2 aces, sorry|pg||
nt|Walddk4: "Set up your side suit first" is a good rule|pg||
nt|npcjpn: strange play. @HA then low and guess.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: ruff is welcome no guesses need now|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Andy Braithwaite will tell you 2NT is not a contract :)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|sharkey: Ø må spille på at N må ha begge Ess for å vinne kontrakten|pg||
nt|lestergold: it wasnt for overtrick played for split spade honours rather than dim finesse which a priori was better odds but suspicous on the dfence|pg||
nt|sharkey: First make your contract - THEN overtricks...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Thanks Liv Marit!|pg||
pc|h3|nt|haans: evry tim you do wrong Have a talk with p|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Winning the ace was strange for a start|pg||
nt|frankaus: quite hard for me as I would be plotting for the beer card|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: ??|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lestergold: 9 dimds would be a better card to play by east|pg||
nt|sharkey: killing lead - but nobody lead high from xxx??|pg||
nt|pelu: why not play @C8 - only chance is to find Q10x in C in N = discard for 3@Ss|pg||
nt|kastan88: OR bidding that 6@S? or NS pushing them in competition?|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Mike, BOA and Martin|pg||
nt|npcjpn: now North knows South has another spade, so the defense is not tough.|pg||
nt|frankaus: i meant for N to X |pg||
nt|kastan88: just change NS hands, and with @C lead just disaster, and, try is good only if some suit running, do you think its spades or diamonds?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|lestergold: we are seeing a lot of card play shall we say less than perfect plays in this match|pg||
pc|h8|nt|suketbombi: wud duck the @H return i suppose while @C shift will make things easy for him|pg||
pc|h7|nt|april7: why not 3 of @D from N?|pg||
nt|jaheim: and it will be a pleasure tu buy   Liv M a beer next year   tx  all   and cong. to team   Ugh|pg||
nt|rv: East (Deb Majumder aka Laltu) is the youngest member of the team, he is in his early thirties and this is his first Intl tourney|pg||
nt|kaz08833: now claim|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|rv: I am sure he must be fairly nervous|pg||
nt|xenya: or not so easy? |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|lestergold: shall we say less than optimum views|pg||
nt|haans: OR forgot  most pass bids|pg||
nt|sybarra: hmm surprised she didnt just cover S card|pg||
nt|othered1: 3@D by west would h ave been too pushy for me.   Should be saved for maximums, not just good shape|pg||
pc|s6|nt|jaheim: går bet nå  stor kl fra hånden hadde vært bedre denne gang|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes but it wasnt that was tying to makem it took ;wrong' view|pg||

nt|bucheister: moving along|pg||
pc|s5|nt|sharkey: Men vil gå beit - hadde ikke råd til å bruke @HK for tidlig|pg||

nt|haans: 1@S at both rooms?|pg||
nt|haans: other bidding at OR|pg||
nt|henryb:  the combination of Souths double on board 4 and North's pass on 7 is strange to my eyes|pg||

nt|djneill:  all 3-3, and 4-2 with doubleton Jack (or stiff Jack)|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill:  so 1/3 of about 47 or 16, +36, + maybe 1 = 53%|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: That could well be right, but I'd need firm numbers on it in my hands before taking back a result where I lost to north @HJ|pg||
nt|rv: HK leading Japan 17-13 in another crucial match in this event|pg||
mb|1D|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|djneill:  shirley would you have bid 3@h with East's hand |pg||
mb|3C|nt|djneill:  over 3@d?|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: This could be tricky for EW.  But east makes it easy|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|djneill:  here, South saw last 2@s overcall worked like a charm, thought he would do it even with a chunky hand|pg||
nt|othered1: Funny how getting your long suits into the auction works out so well so often|pg||
nt|rv: anyone for 2n rebid by East?|pg||
nt|rv: I might have bid 2n to be perfectly honest instead of 3@c|pg||
nt|djneill:  East has an awkward bid... some might open that 2NT and just get the strength out there|pg||
nt|djneill:  but this worked much better|pg||
pc|hK|nt|sybarra2: might have preferenced and try to get out|pg||
nt|rv: I actually like 2n opening as well|pg||
pc|h2|nt|othered1: I like east's auction.  It's practical, at least and partner will know you have real @D length.|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h5|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h3|pc|hA|pc|hQ|pg||

nt|djneill:  plays like a dream here, the crossruff and @d finesse just roll smoothly|pg||
nt|rv: Taipei leading Singapore 13-2 after 4 deals in another vital match in Open event|pg||
nt|othered1: Will our later webcasts cover the open event as well?|pg||
nt|djneill:  but hard to know the @d8 is onside!|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|d9|nt|djneill:  until now|pg||

nt|othered1: nnice ending|pg||
nt|rv: East should still score this|pg||
nt|djneill:  that was risky because if North had the @sQ doubleton, North would get in to shoot another @h through and East if ruffs with the @dJ promotes the @d8|pg||

nt|rv: India coming back a bit in bowling power-play|pg||
nt|kastan88: how now to find even 4@H for EW?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: that's closed up this match of lost opportunities|pg||
nt|npcjpn: South is famous for comic 1NT overcall in Japan, but is it true?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 1NT even if comic is awful|pg||

nt|h_karluk: i expect 4@c|pg||
nt|bucheister: agreed; but playing precision that hand is opened one spade and the rest is history|pg||
nt|othered1: some people are reticent to splinter with stiff A, especially with a limited hand.|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: a fight for the 7. trick - I exp that West wil win that battle|pg||
nt|kastan88: just such preempts, with outside A are not good|pg||

pc|c5|nt|npcjpn: from the bidding, North is marked with at most 3@s and 1@h, so must have 5+@d.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 19 teams in the open, 16 in the women's|pg||
nt|sybarra: must say E was not bashful |pg||
nt|npcjpn: oh, i see. |pg||
nt|kaz08833: N's 4@H is pass or correct|pg||

pc|c4|pg||
nt|npcjpn: win with @HK? Now case for typical second hand high for North.|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Our match in round 4 will be India v Sri Lanka (open)|pg||

pc|d4|nt|h_karluk: suits|pg||
nt|npcjpn: i did not notice 1@c was strong because there is no alert.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|rv: I agree with Sanyal that North did have a case for leading a @s with no entry in his hand trying to lead partner's major|pg||

nt|othered1: I meant in a natural framework.  Big @C systems are different (and work better on 20 counts with some shape)|pg||
nt|djneill:  South chose to show 5+-5+ majors rather than 1@s...2 or 3@h later|pg||

nt|rv: sry may double|pg||
mb|2H|nt|djneill:  spades are significantly better but it's a tradeoff South is willing to make|pg||

nt|sybarra2: sometimes you catch pard with hts|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill:  right, and this time it worked out ok, North might not really want to say much tho|pg||
mb|3D|nt|rv: I will go along with South's choice of Michaels|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill:  West has nothing really to say over 2@d, the unsupported Quacks are kind of sketchy|pg||
mb|p|nt|djneill:  not sure what the 2@h "cue" is|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: I presume West's 2@h shows @h values/stopper and Inv+ hand|pg||
nt|djneill:  East just bids 3@d and West shrugs|pg||
pc|h9|nt|djneill:  it could be part of a "unusual vs. unusual" structure where 2@h is support for one minor and 2@s support for the other|pg||

nt|kastan88: say, if pass with W hand or open 1@D, then South possibly bidding t/o double after 1@H from East, and spades easily found|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: operator - we have skipped 2 boards?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: a michaels special|pg||
mb|3C|nt|pelu: bad luck for NS-players - 4@S down 1 with 3 @c-losers|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: 2@D?|pg||
nt|kaz08833: 2@D = @S OR @H|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: W will guess what it is|pg||
mb|d|nt|npcjpn: 2, 3 or 4@S.|pg||
nt|dslee: to create some problem for NS to reach their game|pg||
nt|sybarra: now we know its a club system of some sort|pg||
nt|xenya: what's that?|pg||
nt|npcjpn: some calls woolsey, some calls multi-landy or reversed cappelletti|pg||
nt|kaz08833: 4@H or 3NT by EW is cold anyway|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: The double is a bit askew .. surely it's just a 2@H bid by South|pg||
nt|vugraphzrc: yeah,i will ask them|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: they must play 3@C rank|pg||
mb|3H|nt|kiwibridge: horrible red suits :(|pg||
nt|bucheister: notice they do not open very light in 3rd seat; I like 1H at this vulnerability|pg||
nt|othered1: You're saying that stayman was the right start to that hand?  It seems wrong if they have either transfer bids or 2-way stayman available.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: even earlier than 76 :) which is when I first met him|pg||
mb|3N|nt|iceblue: 4@S? 3@C? cant be, it is the famous 5332|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: cunning lead Baldrick I had a plan|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: many play 2@s here as F1|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 25 hcp and 4-4 @S fit here but making 3@S wud be tuff for E-W did well to stay away from auction can beat 2@H easily tho|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hard for N after 4 artificial bids|pg||
mb|p|nt|npcjpn: a heart shift is not so difficult to find.|pg||
nt|kaz08833: inspired lead|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 3@S a "youth" bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: I guess EW don't go to the three level without considerable extras.|pg||
nt|frankaus: just costs an overtrick i guess|pg||
pc|dA|nt|rv: this is a match, India will expect to win handsomely, SL putting up a good fight and fairly flat boards so far|pg||

nt|sybarra: went down in 4 @H played from the other side on last hand (other table) |pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|nt|rv: yes as rightly suggested by Ed, strong @c systems are more suited to handle deals where 1 hand is very strong with minimal hcl in partner's hand|pg||

pc|s5|nt|othered1: 14-16, per earlier hand|pg||

nt|xenya: 3@C must be a weak raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceblue: indeed|pg||

nt|npcjpn: now coffee hand.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|rv: he has guessed well though|pg||

nt|kaz08833: 2@H? do NS introduce a new convention?|pg||
pc|d7|nt|kiwibridge: a delicate 4-2 |pg||

nt|kiwibridge: now a 4-3|pg||
pc|dA|pg||

nt|kaz08833: sorry N's contract i see|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|pelu: the first 5 tricks for defense?|pg||
nt|npcjpn: so 3NT has more chance than 3@c.|pg||
nt|kastan88: i would not double with passed partner, IMO better to say just 1@S overcall and hope for possibility later to double for max overcall, if needed|pg||
nt|othered1: There goes the possible 3rd @S trick|pg||
nt|h_karluk: fortunately @s8 at the table|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes always N|pg||
pc|dT|nt|super nova: The consideration here is likly the diamonds.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: great play|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: so another 10 .. NZ headed for a healthy win here|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: EW 5 card majors 2+@C|pg||
pc|d2|nt|kiwibridge: maybe he mis sorted|pg||
nt|kastan88: for me seems East's double over 3@H as penalty oriented... I would left that. East had another forcing bids - 3S 4@C or not?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: X of 3@H take out no one knows why Reid did not open 1@S|pg||
pc|d5|pc|cT|pg||
nt|Walddk4: yes|pg||
nt|othered1: there is a case for east to read the position and play @S2.  West just has to be prepared for that.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and @h j entry there|pg||
pc|d9|nt|kastan88: now in both rooms Kiwis playing diamonds, not rich choice this time|pg||
pc|d6|nt|npcjpn: on board 10, open room EW got to 6@c and down with a spade ruff.|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|rv: he can claim 1 down and go to next deal|pg||
nt|xenya: my opinion too|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|npcjpn: If North reopens 1NT instead of 2@H, NS will get there.|pg||
nt|suketbombi: strange line one looser in every suit now|pg||
nt|bucheister: I am not sure how the duck could work; the old college try would be the A and low|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|Walddk4: Would not be unreasonable to lead a low spade, but it's a disaster as the cards lie|pg||
nt|lmeili: he expects to have @d 3-3 & @s 2-2 break|pg||
nt|kastan88: yes, have not chance, if @HA not right, so still needed to play to @HK|pg||
nt|othered1: declarer will take her  plus without further ado.|pg||
pc|c7|pc|d4|nt|Walddk4: Our match in round 3: Japan v Chinese Taipei (women)|pg||

pc|d8|pg||
pc|c3|nt|npcjpn: yes, @H lead is possible, but @d is impposible, @s looks normal.|pg||
nt|lmeili: perhaps he is still thinking of last hand|pg||
nt|kastan88: imo 2@D was forcing, with 4-card @S could bid 1@S, so why double now for take-out, no logical|pg||

pc|c2|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Only if you have the hand records do you take 12 tricks|pg||
nt|npcjpn: looking for 5-3 spade fit.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Normal play is to take a double finesse in diamonds|pg||
nt|rv: Laltu's direct 2@s is constructive showing good 7-10 hcp, this sequence shows doubleton @s or 3 @s poor hand|pg||
nt|suketbombi: it will make|pg||

nt|kiwi_joker: ok. But he probably wouldnt have ducked trick 1 with A9xx in the suit|pg||
nt|npcjpn: but the play may be different if West has @SA9xx.|pg||

nt|rv: 3@h by South is 5+Cards GF and North bids 3n with no @h fit|pg||

mb|p|nt|npcjpn: even using last train, West is too strong for that.|pg||

nt|kastan88: now 1 or 2 IMPs for Australia, with that club lead|pg||
pc|s7|nt|iceblue: 5@H, 5@S, pass all,:)|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: So if east had shown 5@H (and west had a fit), 3@S is the mirror approach? Slam interest in hearts?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 1430/|pg||
pc|s8|nt|suketbombi: has to drop doubleton Q on AK and back @HS|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: South decides it's time to try and peg back a few IMPs, with a rather desperate raise to game.|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|npcjpn: i play 3@S over 3@h as slam try in @h.|pg||

nt|iceblue: dislike 6@S, 5@D deny controls in @C, |pg||

nt|Walddk4: She will get !AKQ and 4@S shows an honour|pg||
nt|Walddk4: @HAKQ|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Don't you agree?|pg||
nt|pelu: not sure|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I think it's pretty simple. You can sign-off in 4@H, you can't in 4@S|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Easy to remember|pg||
nt|npcjpn: so hard to forget|pg||
nt|pelu: in CR EW had a better action: 2@H - 3@H - 3@S - after 4NT - 5@S East bid 5NT - but West didnt accept|pg||
pc|c2|nt|iceblue: he need @HA, !K @Sk to make 6@S, its impossible, i think|pg||
nt|npcjpn: On this lead, declarer may think he has a chance in guessing, but...|pg||
nt|iceblue: but got is not sitting behind him:)|pg||
nt|npcjpn: but if declarer gives up clubs, then North has to play @h|pg||

pc|cJ|pg||
nt|suketbombi: donno the provocation to bid with 5hcp and that weak @S suit inispite of the 2nt bid but may work here tho|pg||

nt|super nova: I know the Suicide coup where you accidentally squeeze your partner by playing your long suit.|pg||
nt|super nova: What about where you end play yourself ? does that have a name. |pg||
nt|super nova: we saw that coup on the last hand.|pg||
nt|super nova: Perhaps we can invent one like|pg||
nt|super nova: "SELF BURNER"|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: still no auction from board 11 other room|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 11 well earned and very timely imps Japan|pg||
nt|kastan88: and curtains|pg||
nt|bucheister: this should be a lively board|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes but on current form unlikely John:)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|Walddk4: Our match in round 4 will be India v Sri Lanka (open). Dinner break first, so in 1 hour and 50 minutes|pg||
nt|rnmalik: no doubt, took the exit card away from E:)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: it was such a bad lead it cost 14 imps, 2 to go now|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 5 imps ona nothing hand, they do add up|pg||
mb|4S|nt|Walddk4: It's 6 pm (18.00) in China now|pg||
nt|npcjpn: 2@s = @s & a minor.|pg||
nt|kaz08833: actually still border slam because of bad trump break or minor suit ruff|pg||
nt|kastan88: Aussies very needed that 5 IMPs|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: as score stands, india winning match 18-12, decent but would be below their expectations|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: cost the defence 7 imps, 2 to go|pg||
mb|p|nt|npcjpn: 3@c = pass or correct.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: how bad can a trump break be with 10|pg||
nt|kastan88: doesnt matter what to lead, if singleton S in South hand, same elimination|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes still need more but times almost up, not a very swinging set tonight Jaak|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: did she really think it necessary to lurch into 4@S?|pg||
mb|d|nt|kaz08833: what if E had @HAJx?|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwi_joker: My grandmother defeats the slam  (she always leads an ace against them if she holds one)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Can 5@D make on a spade lead?|pg||
nt|suketbombi: knowing the agression may bid 5@S here|pg||
nt|lmeili: W may bid 5@s|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: in effect 12 as beating it is +5|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes several kibs point out cold on any lead with same line|pg||
nt|bucheister: that is a very aggressive bid by W|pg||
mb|p|nt|npcjpn: now EW can avoid to play 4-4 @s fit.|pg||
mb|p|nt|bucheister: and it will payoff|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: aggressive being a psudonym :)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|npcjpn: only 11%.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|Walddk4: Not that they will get there of course|pg||
nt|rv: way too many flat boards in this set, keep fingers crossed to get a real swingy last deal:)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: they call it drop dead stayman|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: S will pass any response|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||
nt|suketbombi: a relieved N :)|pg||
nt|lmeili: will u bid 3N with S' hand?|pg||
nt|xenya: enterprising double from E |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: unlikely play, so back to only making on bad lead|pg||
nt|kastan88: how to say, Mongolia China 111 IMPs in this set, but sure that is another case, and not need to compare|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hK|nt|kiwibridge: strike oil in dummy|pg||
pc|h4|nt|pelu: not so easy to play 5@D on a @s-lead from East|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|suketbombi: @D3?|pg||
nt|kastan88: but sure double dummy, not likely cashing SA, before throwing out in trumps, more per centage to play for 1CQ and @SK in same hand|pg||
nt|kastan88: or not?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: no @S missing two bullets imps come back|pg||
pc|sK|nt|xenya: but perhaps just 2@H from W would have been enough? |pg||
pc|s5|nt|bucheister: when she sees the spade story then will finesse a heart and go down an extra|pg||
nt|rnmalik: If W can finesse or guess the Q@H, would be good play on @D.|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sA|pg||
nt|npcjpn: if you can guess both red suits, you can make 6@D.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Maybe it needs a club finesse to the 10|pg||
nt|bucheister: most would rebid 4S with her hand|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: so in the end a big win for C-T after a positive start by NZ|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Jane assists with a no reason double|pg||
pc|h6|pc|sT|nt|rv: this event is held in Port city of Northern China|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: wow they made the cards swing for them :)|pg||
pc|h9|nt|Walddk4: Ruff spade, heart to hand, club to the 10|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Then I think you have 11 tricks|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|sybarra: E made one more try in the open room |pg||
pc|c6|nt|rv: Ning Bo|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|bucheister: I think it was a desparate double out of frustration by S|pg||
pc|s9|nt|suketbombi: should give a @H relief now|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Cant 9@D missing.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|suketbombi: good defence |pg||
pc|d3|pc|c5|pg||
pc|s8|nt|kiwibridge: Jaak you have been great, as has our operator, the feedback spectators has been excellent, join me again in 30 minutes for our final match of the day|pg||
pc|c2|nt|bucheister: that is playing for down one; the extra under trick is worth 13 imps gamble|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: China wins the match quite easily one board to go|pg||
pc|d6|pc|c3|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thanks to our great operator XU LI and my fellow excellent commentators, hope specs will join me in 30 minutes when the Kiwi ladies clash with Korea, should be a great show|pg||
pc|s7|nt|rnmalik: The declarer hand a chance to make 6@H tricks by ruffing @S and did not.|pg||
pc|d5|nt|npcjpn: 4 down?|pg||
pc|c9|pc|d7|pg||
nt|bucheister: and she will make 5|pg||
pc|s6|nt|kiwibridge: as always thx to Roland Wald our organiser and to Fred, Uday and BBO|pg||
pc|c7|pc|cK|nt|suketbombi: all set to collect their 25 VPS is chinese Taipei|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|s4|pc|d2|nt|npcjpn: now 3 down only.|pg||
nt|xenya: not that 3@H was utterly unreasonable -- it did put some pressure on the opponents|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|xenya: and, of course, the contract could be made|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|kiwibridge: nice sq|pg||

nt|djneill:  lol|pg||
mb|1C|nt|rv: Ind up 28-8 (20-10) after 12 deals vs Pak, China 46-13 (23-7) after 10 deals vs HK, Taipe 45-3 (25-5) vs Singapore in Open event|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|djneill:  East has an interesting rebid|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|rv: I expect Open event to go down to the wire (last round) before we get to know destination of medals|pg||
nt|djneill:  West bypassed the major(s) since East should not have a major for a 1@d response with a minimal uninteresting hand|pg||
nt|djneill:  oops|pg||
nt|othered1: A wonderful standard auction.  Maybe west doesn't have a real opening bid?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|rv: here E-W play Walshs style 1@c-1@d-1n can have 1 or both 4M|pg||
nt|djneill:  North will probabl lead a @h, and South switches to a low @s and a ruff is obtained, to go with the long club and @dA|pg||
pc|h2|nt|djneill:  the @sA is pretty but in reality an unsupported Ace (or doubleton for that matter) are just bad leads|pg||

nt|rv: also words of appreciation for organizers and BBO to broadcast this event and Roland Wald to co-ordinate all these broadcasts|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: great commentary, and thanks all specs for your great feedback|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the Kiwis will be diappointed but a match played in great spirit I dare say|pg||
mb|d|nt|sybarra: is next set,  |pg||

nt|kiwibridge: operator can you please check we think it made with overtricks|pg||
nt|kastan88: again IMp(s) from nothing, but not right team, need to check operator|pg||
nt|kastan88: was 2S+2|pg||
mb|r|nt|rv: loong way to go before we can get an indication of where medals are going|pg||
nt|psridhar: i just saw the auction in the other room this bd- it went 1h-1n-2c-2s-.....and a strange 5c|pg||
nt|kastan88: as demonstrated|pg||
mb|1H|nt|sybarra: the bid that E hated to hear,  X!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and to the PABF and CCBA for letting us in|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: changed to making we just need the +2|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thanks to John and Shirley for great comments, thx operator and specs for your great feedback, join me the Kiwi again in about 90 minutes for the next round|pg||
mb|2C|nt|npcjpn: multi, pass or correct, and takeout double.|pg||
nt|super nova: ho ho.|pg||
nt|xenya: double presumably shows an unknown long suit|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: and special thanks to Nick for sending and interpeting his dad's cc|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thx operator, and so our last for the match and the day.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: and this E puts it back pard |pg||
nt|sybarra: in our room,  e/w was playing precision |pg||
nt|bucheister: Playing a strong club sometimes partner will just bid a game with a full opening bid; this may not b e the perfect example but they are stuck many imps|pg||
nt|suketbombi: you have to give up on such a good @C suit when u open 1 Nt on this hand|pg||
nt|kastan88: same words from me, tx to spectators for right comments, tx to fellow commentator Gary.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|rv: hope it was not doubled?|pg||
nt|psridhar: yes N leaped all the way to 5c over 2s|pg||
nt|rv: is it a misclick by Vugraph operator because auction looks unreal|pg||
nt|psridhar: i thk no game makes -may be 4H |pg||
nt|kastan88: what is time at your Gary?|pg||
mb|4H|nt|lmeili: suprised W did'nt transfer to 2@h|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes surprising indeed no body here got his suit in:)|pg||
nt|lmeili: NS can make their 3N now|pg||
nt|suketbombi: :)|pg||
nt|super nova: most likly 8 tricks.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: a complicated hand, difficult to stay away from 4@S.|pg||
nt|npcjpn: after a diamond lead, if declarer plays a club before a spade..|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: I presume its actually South who is in 1NT|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Or maybe East.|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Or somebody|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: operator??|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I'll be here tomorrow and hope you can join me|pg||
nt|bucheister: Thanks Gary; enjoyed it|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the 4@SX+1 again a flat board :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: so the 1 @C could have none, and E tried 2 @H |pg||
nt|npcjpn: took out in 3-card suit.|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|Walddk4: PABF is now APBF, sorry|pg||
nt|rv: world's most popular contract makes right?|pg||
nt|psridhar: in 4h u take a spd ruff, concede 1sp+1h+1c=|pg||
nt|rv: 2@s, 4@h, 2@c and 1@d for 9 tricks in 3n|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: we have 5 more rounds over the weekend I'll be here for all of them, it's just 10pm  now I could do another set now|pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: should have played the queen makes it like the lead was form KL3|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Mr Song Zhao from the CCBA has been instrumental in setting up a fine show. Many thanks to him|pg||
nt|suketbombi: a signal for @D:)|pg||
nt|xenya: but i'm at a loss as to what E's double means|pg||
nt|xenya: so penalty...|pg||
nt|kastan88: so must be very late for players and operators,  is understandable mistakes after long working day|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: sry yes 3nt shd make easily|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: Hi Vladimir, 1st D ok but i am afraid 2nd D idea wld b a trouble with such poor values, so far declarer wld have no difficulty to bring the contract home|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes, thx all spectators for watching and thx Jaak you made great commentary|pg||
pc|dK|nt|Walddk4: Today's last match in 1 hour and 38 minutes|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Choo loses the plot big time here :(|pg||
pc|dA|nt|robinswr: KJ3|pg||
nt|sybarra: can N "see" the South diamond holding?|pg||
nt|xenya: however 2@S should play quite well here |pg||
nt|kaz08833: seems another swing|pg||
nt|mwigor: in china its around 6pm i think|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: also Frank Budai who joined us for a while|pg||
pc|d8|nt|Walddk4: This is the last board of the match, thanks to our flawless operator Xu Li, and PABF and CCBA for the show|pg||
nt|psridhar: over 2c, Ashok goel found the technically correct 2s....|pg||
nt|kastan88: still, played lot of today :)|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|rv: I would have bid 3n with South hand after partner's 2n possibly showing 16-17|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dT|nt|kiwibridge: on H run 9 tricks|pg||
pc|d4|nt|xenya: possibly 9 tricks can be made|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: win run J@H|pg||
nt|npcjpn: 3 heart tricks only, so needs a club finesse.|pg||
nt|kaz08833: or normally @S?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: or just give N @S + 2D|pg||
nt|npcjpn: test @c first , then @s finesse is a normal play.|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|Walddk4: India vs Sri Lanka (open teams)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: maybe only -3|pg||
nt|bucheister: it is always correct to lead a trump on these auctions; even the stiff J|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: indeed|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: that would be a top lead|pg||
pc|hK|nt|Walddk4: Also thanks to our commentators, Nobuyuki and Alywn and Steve|pg||
nt|Walddk4: welcome back then|pg||
pc|h2|nt|kiwibridge: 8@D may be SP for @S|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|psridhar: hard to explain that leap to 5c|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|nt|h_karluk: the declarer has enough  entries to enjoy club suit|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: that is declarer committing hari kari I feel|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Walddk4: Next match in about 35 minutes|pg||
nt|npcjpn: but it seems normal to hope @c 3-2 or @s finesse working.|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|npcjpn: now at least one down?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: has cut his own comms channel |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: compresses 1 trick|pg||
pc|d6|nt|Walddk4: Japan v Chinese Taipei (women)|pg||
nt|kastan88: well earned 13 IMPs for singapure in opened room, I hope that was they played right on 3rd trick: after ducking spade lead taking 2nd @S  in hand and playing @H10 for J finesse ...|pg||
nt|kastan88: from East hand. This working against @H entry in long spades hand in East hand, and later declarer can check for diamond lay-out, if they are 4-1, may throw in with 4th @D or ...|pg||
nt|kastan88: eliminate or|pg||
nt|kastan88: diamonds and hearts and throw in with clubs|pg||
nt|xenya: so likely a huge swing to Singapore  |pg||
nt|kastan88: and, Gary, you said, not many swings in this set? :)|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|rv: Rex's 3@h seems to be a gross underbid here though I wouldn't have bid 2n with KP's hand|pg||
pc|h4|nt|npcjpn: you mean @s discard.|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h3|nt|npcjpn: oops|pg||

pc|s9|nt|xenya: thanks everyone|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
