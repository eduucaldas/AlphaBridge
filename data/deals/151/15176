pc|h2|pc|h5|nt|athene: So this will be the final contract; I assume South opened 1@D and West doubled and N-S were forced up to 3@D.|pg||

nt|patricck: my waistline is testimony to my expertise in Buffet points :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Was it Hamman East, Zia West?|pg||
nt|brolucius: I think so.|pg||
nt|athene: 1NT is notoriously difficult to defend and at this form of scoring every trick matters - conceding 120 instead of 90 can be as big a disaster as going for a phantom 1400.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Not that this makes a 120 as exciting as a 1400, as I see it.|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|brolucius: A dull 1NT contract does not suddenly flare into life because 'Ah, it's matchpoint scoring!'|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cA|pc|c5|pc|h6|pg||
nt|brolucius: May do for the players, but not for the crusty BBO commentators.|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d5|pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dQ|nt|Walddk2: Essentially, this becomes Super-Matchpoints: every overtrick, every undertrick, the difference between playing in No Trump versus a Major may decide the board|pg||
nt|athene: If the defence had attacked hearts I think they would have held this to 9 tricks.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|Walddk2: For simplicity, we are using the European style of 2 points for a win, 1 point for a tie and 0 points for a loss|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
pc|c7|nt|athene: Declarer has to concede a spade and @DAK, or attack diamonds and lose a heart.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|Walddk2: We are starting with the Pairs competition. Each pair has drawn a pair from the other team, with whom their scores will be compared. Each pair will play an 11-board match against ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: each of the remaining five pairs from the opposing team|pg||
nt|patricck: thanks to South's 9@H..  without that card a @H attack would have given away a trick|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The overall competition is scored at "Buffett Points". Each match/set from each event has been assigned a point value, based on the number of boards involved. The Pairs and Teams ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: will have 4 BPs at stake for each match; the Individual will have 2 BPs at stake for each match|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d7|pg||
pc|c3|nt|brolucius: After a 3@D and a 1NT deal, we will feel that we have 'done out duty' and deserve something more palatable.|pg||
pc|sT|nt|Walddk2: This leaves 60 Buffett Points to be contested for the Pairs, 72 for the Teams and 66 for the Individual. With 198 total BPs at stake, the first team to 100 points wins the trophy. ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If the teams tie with 99 BPs each, Europe, as holders, will retain the Cup.|pg||
pc|s8|pc|h4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The inaugural event in 2006 in Ireland was won by USA, but Europe equalised two years later in Kentucky, USA|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s6|pc|s5|nt|brolucius: In the first holding of the event, 4 years ago, the Individual had double the points on offer now, giving it disproportional importance. The USA won that segment easily, because ( ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: thought) they all play similar systems while Europeans had to contend with partners with a very different bidding philosophy. However, 2 years later, the Europeans won the ...|pg||

nt|brolucius: The Great Dealer has relented.|pg||
mb|1D|nt|athene: 1NT is unlikely on this board, yes.|pg||
mb|d|mb|r|nt|brolucius: East might bid 2@H (pre-emptive) now if non-vulnerable.|pg||
mb|3H|nt|brolucius: Hah!|pg||
nt|athene: Many pairs play that a jump is pre-emptive over a redouble.  This can cause problems if you have a good hand (and the redouble is a psyche, or the opening bid is).|pg||
nt|patricck: 1NT is unlikely... so is the par result of 6NT making :)|pg||
mb|5D|nt|athene: The best strategy is that if you pass the redouble then bid a new suit that shows values.  If you bid a suit right away that's weak.|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: An easy sixth diamond for North.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Roger Bryant, live from the venue in Wales|pg||
nt|brolucius: He may even try for a grand.|pg||
nt|athene: He'll want to play in notrumps.|pg||
nt|athene: It is point a board remember.|pg||
nt|athene: 6NT is my guess.|pg||
nt|roghog: Hi all. I'm at the venue here in Cardiff,so welcome! |pg||
nt|brolucius: Brogeland/Saelensminde rarely bid a small slam without looking for a grand on the way!|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: OK, so there we are :)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|athene: Maybe he was worried about a black-suit singleton with partner - then if you get a lead in that suit, 6NT can look very silly indeed.|pg||
nt|athene: And people often meanly don't lead their bid suit when you jump to 6NT over it.|pg||
nt|patricck: just a matter of playing @S for one loser, there are a number of lines declarer might adopt, but this should make|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer can lead towards the @SQ and then finesse the @S10. Or he can try for an elimination end position, eliminating clubs and hearts.|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|pc|h4|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|cJ|pc|c4|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, he is eliminating the club suit.|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c9|nt|brolucius: @DJ, I expect|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|c2|pg||
nt|athene: If you can strip the hand then lead @SQ - king - ace, then back to hand and lead towards the @S10.|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h8|pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d8|pc|dQ|pc|d6|pg||
nt|athene: That gives you the contract when West has @SKJ, as is likely, but also gives you the added bonus that if East wins @SJx on the second round of the suit he is endplayed.|pg||
pc|dK|pc|c7|nt|patricck: given the double the elimination followed by a spade to the 8@S seems best as the K@S is certainly with West, the J@S is only likely to be there|pg||

nt|athene: preliminary work.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Pity we did not see the conclusion.|pg||
nt|athene: A solid 7-4 fit was just the ticket on that last hand.|pg||
pc|h9|nt|vugraphzrd: Sorry i got some discards wrong that lead to problems|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hK|pc|h4|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hQ|nt|athene: When I tell students to open 1NT on hands like that East, as it simplifies the auction, they tell me it has two doubletons.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, didn't you notice them, Bill?|pg||
nt|patricck: The decision to open 1NT on the 5-4 shape isn't necessarily wrong, but it will work out badly if the comparison is against someone who found their @S fit|pg||
nt|athene: I tell them to adopt a more cheerful and carefree attitude to life.|pg||
nt|roghog: Qx often seems good for NT hands, but not here|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hT|pg||
pc|h6|pc|c5|pc|h8|nt|brolucius: The usual advice is to open the 5-card suit if you are confident that you will be able to rebid the 4-card suit on the next round. With 5 clubs and 4 spades, East had no problem ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: with bidding his suits.|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|athene: Sure, this particular 5422 is one of the "worst" for opening 1NT - you are happier with the awkward shapes like 2452.|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|brolucius: Yes, when you are not strong enough for a 'reverse'.|pg||
nt|athene: But even so, you will see many good players opening 1NT.|pg||
nt|roghog: Will he put N in to lead a @C?. No|pg||
pc|d5|pc|h7|nt|brolucius: They are so used to playing with sponsor partners... and want to grab the contract. A difficult habit to shake off.|pg||
nt|athene: I don't think Hamman plays with clients that much these days does he?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Hamman could not shake it off, even when partnering Zia!|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s6|pc|s3|pc|s5|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|brolucius: Another reason to open 1NT is that they are really playing match-points here and NT scores heavily. You don't want to end in clubs.|pg||

mb|1C!|nt|athene: A loss for Z-H I mean.  East will open 1@C (clubs or balanced, 15+) and it's likely they will find spades.|pg||
mb|1D|nt|brolucius: The European team looks particularly strong to me, this year. I wonder who the bookies have installed as favourites.|pg||
mb|1H|an|!s|nt|brolucius: 1@C may be bid on a three-card suit.|pg||
mb|2D|nt|brolucius: 1@H transfer|pg||
mb|2S|nt|athene: 4@S from South now will probably buy it.|pg||
nt|vugraphzrd: may be bid on two according to table.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Difficult evaluation problem for South now.|pg||
nt|roghog: no spot betting, I hope|pg||
mb|3D|mb|3H|nt|brolucius: Oh, may be two clubs. Well, I am looking at their 2007 convention card (when they won the Bermuda Bowl).|pg||
mb|4C|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Fancy changing your system from one that was good enough to win the world's top event!|pg||
mb|4D|nt|patricck: A good bid from Zia...Hamman is certain to bid 5@D over 4@S now|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|athene: Perhaps South bids 3@H instead of 4@S because he wants to involve his partner over the likely/possible 5@D|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|mb|5S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dK|pc|dT|nt|brolucius: No point in doubling 5@S on such auctions. You just sit back and take your good board if 5@S goes off. (Odds are slightly different at matchpoints, no doubt).|pg||
nt|athene: But in that case, this auction looks strange - maybe 3@H was a tactical shot just trying to persuade E-W to let him have it in 4@S.|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d7|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|patricck: The decision to bid 5@S could easily have been right ... if the opposing spades had been 3-0 then 5@D may well have been making|pg||
nt|brolucius: East-West's auction to 5@D was hardly convincing, so I am a bit surprised that Brogeland has bid five over five.|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s6|nt|roghog: Not near enough the table to get the explanations|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s8|pc|sA|pc|d3|pg||
nt|athene: My guess is, West's 4@C bid raised the spectre of a double fit hand in South's mind.|pg||
mc|10|nt|brolucius: Hamman bid only 4@D over 4@C, and then 5@D. He could be bluffing. of course, in the expectation that 4@S would come.|pg||
nt|athene: 1@C could be @SAxxx @HAKxx @Dxxx @Cxx for example :)|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C|an|alert|nt|brolucius: If North held both the majors that strongly, HE could bid 5@S. That was the advantage of South showing his second suit.|pg||
mb|p|mb|1H|an|1s|mb|p|mb|1S|nt|brolucius: Common to play transfers opposite a 1@C opening nowadays.|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: For some, 1@S here shows three - that is how transfer responses were played when they first appeared.|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: 1@S shows three-card support and is limited to around 17 points in their system.|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|athene: But these days it's more common for a simple completion of the transfer to just show any weak notrump with 2 or 3 card support.|pg||
nt|brolucius: With 18-19, they choose something like 2NT and look for a 5-3 fit on the next round.|pg||
nt|roghog: Zia asks how many @S 1@S shows. I think they rebid 1NT with a doubleton|pg||
nt|patricck: looks like 1@S, 1@D and 1@C loser with the favourable position in 2 suits and the unfavourable K@C|pg||
nt|athene: Yes, 4@S bid on five suggests 1@S shows three.|pg||

nt|Walddk2: From the next macth and onwards we will have linked tables for the corresponding pairs. That will make it easier to keep track of the scores and standings|pg||

nt|brolucius: West no doubt shows five clubs with his raise (since East might be short). So, with four clubs, Hamman can advance to the nine-trick level (nine trumps = nine-trick contract).|pg||
nt|athene: Someone with the Goldsmith evaluator thingie can find out - my guess is, it will say he has about a 16 count.|pg||

nt|athene: There are various chances for a ninth trick, but you probably would have to see all the cards.  You might throw East in to lead into the diamonds or something.|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h2|nt|brolucius: 1@S is played as a catch-all. Brogeland plays 1NT as 11-12 points now. I don;t know how much of his system with Svendsen he has persuaded Erik Saelensminde to adopt.|pg||
nt|brolucius: 1@C - 1NT as 11-12 points, I mean.|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h9|pg||
nt|athene: Yes, if you open bad 11 counts it's nice to be able to show 11-12 in response without going to the dreaded 2NT level.|pg||
