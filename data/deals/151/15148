nt|jbgood: well put David, a less than perfect defense may even allow 3 spades to make|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm a nice freak|pg||
nt|roswolf: practical bidding in the other room|pg||
nt|vugraphzqn: they|pg||
nt|arno11: looked like making only 5 but...|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: @C7 might be a big card if east plays 3nt on a club lead|pg||
mb|1D|an|!|nt|vugraphpl2: witamy kibicow|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w were slightly unlucky in the other room|pg||
nt|rv: I agree, if it at all it means something logical, it should be the expn of t/o of @s with max pre-empt (close to opening hand)|pg||
nt|athene: but i certainly would never ever bid it unless i KNEW partner would know it was forcing|pg||
nt|arno11: in the closed room EW apparently had a misunderstanding about the meaning of 2NT|pg||
mb|1N|an|!|nt|jbgood: may be duplicated|pg||
nt|tomi2: I dont like the double of 3@D, for me it does not show Kjxx, its just for the lead, think one should bid something to committ the partnership to 4th level to show the willing to ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: play 4@H or 5@D|pg||
nt|henryb:  reaching 6@h is well done|pg||
nt|arno11: making 6 was right in the last bd|pg||
nt|fabsayc: that delayed 2nt in closed room would be minors for me|pg||
nt|athene: 1nt raptor i assume|pg||
mb|2C|an|!|nt|marlowepi: in other words, it means "i should have opened 1H"|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no diamond raise form South|pg||
nt|athene: showing 4major and longer minor|pg||
nt|athene: standard in poland - i guess they double with a normal 1nt overcall|pg||
nt|fabsayc: will keep north out of trouble|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well should anyway|pg||
mb|2D|an|!|nt|rv: :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: other major + longer minor?|pg||
nt|athene: i.e. we discussed it not earlier than 30 minutes before the start of the session :) |pg||
nt|mdgraham: at least it wasn't vulnerable - and you never know, maybe the opps will go in 6@S |pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: same start as the other room|pg||
nt|athene: 2@D is asking for south's major, i am told|pg||
nt|athene: i think north has a shrewd idea which it will be|pg||
mb|2S|nt|roswolf: yes 7@H would however be very unlucky|pg||
nt|othered1: Agree, forcing in lebensohl, but I know some who invert it (2N then 3@S forces, 3@S direct invites.)  Lets partner reject 3@Con the right hand.|pg||
mb|3D|nt|roswolf: the @C10 might have been a good shot for the defence|pg||
nt|roswolf: even so dont particulary like dbl|pg||
nt|rv: Raptor is not very popular, Sandwitch nt to show other 2 suits after (1x)-(1y) is more popular|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: so East should buy 4@s |pg||
nt|peachy: if it was a Precision 1D, I'm not surprised|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mdgraham: you might bid 2@D anyway, as with two spades the opposition are likely to be raising  |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why on earth do you need Leb there when you have 2@S as sign off?|pg||
nt|peachy: some also have agreement on which sequence show/denies stopper|pg||
nt|athene: well as i said, it's less useful, certainly, but it still has SOME use|pg||
nt|athene: you can differentiate between weak and invitational hands with clubs|pg||
nt|othered1: Was 4@S fast arrival or just accepting game.  If fast arrival, they must have high standards for free bids, while many pairs lower their standards in comp.|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: and you can differentiate between forcing and invitational hands in a major|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe, but South had spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: except north bid 3@S rather than 4@C|pg||
nt|brolucius: Not unreasonable for North to bid strongly on his hand, which has potential. 3@S by North at the other table was a bit on the cautious side.|pg||
nt|vugraphzqn: he missbid 3 @c|pg||
nt|vugraphzqn: then he bid 4@c|pg||
nt|roswolf: AAHHH|pg||
nt|rv: I prefer 1n O/C to show 15-18 though I like Sandwitch NT |pg||
nt|athene: east has a pretty good hand but she knows she is probably getting a club, rather than a spade, lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: so her tiny club spots must be a concern|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the carnage in 2s doubled would have been massive|pg||
pc|cK|nt|roswolf: 2nt = enquiry for minor!?|pg||
pc|cT|nt|roswolf: this is tight but can/should go -1|pg||
nt|jbgood: .. and if you want to play 4 @s, you dont give away your hand by bidding 4 @c?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: matchpoint methods, IMHBAICO. i would never give up strong NT overcall at IMPs. variety of approaches is certainly interesting though|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c6|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@S is forcing to game in my book|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why make bridge so complicated|pg||
nt|athene: but now suddenly they aren't so tiny after all|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|tihana: hi all|pg||
nt|mdgraham: amusing that East can't ruff a diamond in dummy |pg||
nt|athene: hi good evening|pg||
nt|tihana: from pula live :)|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|athene: he plays this way to force the defence to give him a black-suit finesse|pg||
pc|h9|pc|cA|pg||
nt|roswolf: very interesting and i agree raptor is a pairs gadget|pg||
nt|athene: and in theory if you subscribe to all the standard Lebensohl tenets you can show or deny a diamond stopper, etc|pg||
nt|arno11: hopefully not really the @C6|pg||
nt|vugraphzqn: asking for signals now...|pg||
nt|jaapfr:  |pg||
nt|vugraphzqn: but cant heard...sry..|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|tomi2: yes! this works well when partner has the ace, if not op will often nottake a finesse if he has some other play available|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@S  rubbish   3@S  invite   4@S  game   KISS|pg||
nt|othered1: To avoid missing good slams or getting too high on the wrong hands.|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|pc|d7|pg||
nt|athene: spade finesse immediately i would think|pg||
nt|arno11: but still no problem to make 9|pg||
nt|athene: then all is well|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|nt|peachy: Hi and thanks for joing here, a little local color never hurts!!!!!|pg||
nt|athene: you can often use elimination-type positions to this end|pg||
nt|tihana: we strongly support she - who goes to bad at 8 :)|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|mdgraham: don't mind where she goes, as long as she's bad :) |pg||
nt|athene: good girls go to heaven - bad girls go everywhere|pg||
nt|athene: well i agree, 4@S was the simple bid, but i am just saying what south's rationale was :)|pg||
nt|peachy: Roland is right, unless stron ground on artificial sequence bids, best just to bid what you think makes|pg||
nt|fabsayc: diamond return best|pg||
nt|arno11: shld be 400 and 6 Imps th EW|pg||
pc|d8|nt|peachy: I'm thining he'll make an overtrick, but certainly at least 9|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mdgraham: bad girls got to Essex |pg||
pc|d2|pc|d9|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I dislike too much science|pg||
nt|arno11: she|pg||
nt|peachy: Ahe, apologies|pg||
nt|peachy: She|pg||
pc|dT|nt|brolucius: The defenders have made no mistake and declarer will have to look long and hard to find anywhere to ditch one of his two diamond losers. I wish him good luck.|pg||
nt|arno11: having 76 in @C now wld be nice....:)|pg||
pc|c2|pc|dK|pc|d4|pg||
nt|fabsayc: declarer is sort of squeezed, this is not a claimer|pg||
pc|d6|nt|marlowepi: so they play that a double of 1S is penalty? even playing gadgets i dont see any call but double on the S gand|pg||
pc|h4|nt|roswolf: or a revoke|pg||
nt|roswolf: a push|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hand, not gand (or gland)|pg||
nt|tihana: :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but we won't have any Essex Girl jokes here, thanks all the same|pg||
pc|h3|nt|athene: yes, if she runs nine then plays @HA and another, she might find an overtrick drops into her lap|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|d5|pc|h6|nt|athene: she might be thinking about throwing south in with one black suit to lead into the other|pg||
nt|athene: she knows south has a singleton heart|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c5|pg||
nt|athene: so @HA, @C7 now is a sure thing isn't it?|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|pc|hA|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c9|nt|athene: south is counted for 4-1-2-6|pg||
pc|s4|pc|h8|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s5|pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s8|nt|athene: nicely played|pg||
pc|h5|pc|s6|pg||
pc|hT|pc|s9|pc|hQ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|arno11: 7 imps sry|pg||
nt|peachy: well counted|pg||
nt|fabsayc: to avoid this south had to keep two clubs, of course declarer can always prevail|pg||
nt|peachy: and played to guarantee contract|pg||
nt|arno11: well played|pg||

nt|haans: 3nt possible|pg||
nt|othered1: tougher if north preempts|pg||
mb|2D!|an|w2M|mb|p|mb|2H|nt|haans: 2@D must be Multi|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: I think east has a reopening double, but it could be wrong|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|nt|haans: 3nt with @HT Golden card|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: might depend on their methods over multi.  If east had a way to make a takeout of @H over 2@D, the double here might mean something else.|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|othered1: But I have no idea what 2N implies.|pg||
nt|haans: agressive?|pg||
nt|othered1: Is it really natural here?  why?|pg||
nt|haans: understand 3@D even less|pg||
nt|othered1: perhaps taking 2N as for minors?|pg||

nt|tomi2: this auction will not be duplicated here. Polish pairs play 1@D as negative over (1@C)-x-(p)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.pzbs.pl/wyniki/turnieje/2010/pula/team/pulateamleaderb.html  for running scores|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is a nasty hand for n/s|pg||
nt|rv: yes agree Marshall even playing raptor, X seems a good option|pg||
nt|athene: a good slam here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Leb me here, Rump be there. Too much can go wrong|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I repeat, KISS|pg||
nt|athene: yes, south's best line of defence is to throw a small spade, looking shifty|pg||
nt|athene: like a man baring an honour|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: this looks a reasonable slam|pg||
nt|athene: unusual to play 3nt with a 5-4 major fit and unbalanced hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: needs to study body language of poker players|pg||
mb|1H|nt|athene: 6@S needs 3-2 spades and no club ruff most of the time|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: ok over 1@D this does not work|pg||
mb|1S|nt|roswolf: north mustnt get too carried away with his points|pg||
nt|brolucius: Krakow is a beautiful mediaeval city, where the restaurants serve a lot of game dishes, such as venison. A great place for a week's holiday.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: NS obviously not Precision, so it looks like 1@D was natural on the previous hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: same auction so far as in Closed Room|pg||
nt|mdgraham: good barrage|pg||
nt|tihana: S doesnt need much from p|pg||
nt|athene: south might just wheel out blackwood now, trusting his partner to have little wastage in diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: i think that is the practical decision|pg||
nt|athene: rare to see a 1@S response on this sort of hand|pg||
nt|athene: most people wheel out their trusty GF-major-raise, whatever it may be|pg||
mb|2D|nt|tomi2: do you bid 1@S or 1@H with north hand? and why?|pg||
nt|rv: 1@c is 3 way here|pg||
nt|peachy: 2S likely final contract here, unless NS interfere and push them to game|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: nor must west!!!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good evening to Peter Gill|pg||
nt|roswolf: what was 1nt supposed to be?|pg||
nt|petergill: Hi|pg||
nt|athene: wow|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mdgraham: normal-looking stuff|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't like 2@S one bit|pg||
nt|athene: a heavy 2@S bid for sure|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: to me 3D is hasty -- you might have a heart game. with this shape and nobody bidding spades, it is unlikely opps can outbid you, so go slow. if they bid more clubs, diamonds still ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: rank higher|pg||
nt|tihana: hihi|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@S is a rubber bridge bid|pg||
nt|mdgraham: any reason for not liking 2@S, Roland?|pg||
nt|othered1: What do you bid?  2@D?   Limited opening bid systems handle this hand better.\|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: certainly you have to give partner a bit of slack since 3@S was bid under pressure and hence it's a "good 2@S bid up to a mediocre 3@S bid" - with a good 3@S bid north should just ...|pg||
nt|athene: bid game - but even so|pg||
nt|tihana: South should go to bed at 8 :) |pg||
nt|athene: well 2@D is more flexible|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: north is wondering who has the spades . if prd has them, he must be very weak|pg||
nt|henryb:  More to the point, do you make a takeout double of 1@d with South or remain a churchmouse, silent and waiting|pg||
nt|roswolf: i bid 1@H "UP THE LINE"|pg||
pc|sT|nt|roswolf: fair comment|pg||
nt|rv: I would have bid 2@h on 1@d O/C to show @hs and @ds, fit showing jump|pg||
nt|rv: instead of 3@d by East|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes for me 3@D would show a worthless hand |pg||
nt|athene: a very nice fit and the heart onside means three overtricks i think, if declarer plays it flat out|pg||
nt|fabsayc: can pick up 2 imps for making seven|pg||
pc|sA|nt|arno11: declarer might make all the tricks with @H s as trumps so a couple of imps back|pg||
pc|s8|nt|roswolf: this should be a cakewalk|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|athene: flexible being the F-word that roland approves of :)|pg||
pc|hT|nt|roswolf: heart suit quality not good enough for me for a fit jump|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|nt|tomi2: dont understand easts pass here. ater not selling out to 1@S and a raise by partner Game should be a good shot|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but spades is really where you live|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, I bid 2@D. We could be cold for 5@D for all I know|pg||
nt|athene: you can't ruff two diamonds in dummy without east overruffing though so perhaps 12 is the limit|pg||
pc|h3|nt|athene: not when partner has @DKJxxx / @Sx|pg||
nt|peachy: With 6-4 and not a bad hand, opener rebids 2D, and bad hand 2S.  Matter of what opener evaluated, I think|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hJ|nt|peachy: In the other room, it was South who bid 4D, thast could have excited North at least a little|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|athene: you don't like it when you get pre-empted out of a slam, but you like it less when you get pre-empting into a slam which doesn't make|pg||
pc|hA|nt|fabsayc: 13 is cold with diamonds 33|pg||
pc|c2|nt|marlowepi: even if it is invitational in their methods i think it is both an underbid and tactically injudicious. |pg||
nt|roswolf: another push|pg||
pc|h8|nt|jbgood: agree - 3 NT should be a good shot|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|petergill: Declarer should flatten the board|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You do in USA, that is not mainstream in Europe|pg||
nt|arno11: need to ruff only 1 diamond as they break 3-3|pg||
pc|c4|nt|Walddk2: When you have 2 suits, bid them|pg||
nt|peachy: oooh, that I did not know. THank you|pg||
nt|athene: some people always show the 4-card suit - i believe larry cohen wrote an article on it where he said that Berkowitz ALWAYS showed the lower-ranking suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The idea is that it must be more relevant for partner to know at least 9 cards rather than 6|pg||
nt|athene: ah yes sorry apologies|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cA|nt|othered1: They play Precision, which changes things|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That is simple logic|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|athene: of course you only need one diamond ruff :)|pg||
pc|c7|nt|peachy: To me, when the discrepancy of suit quality os as great as it is here. I like 2S|pg||
nt|othered1: They = Cohen Berkowitz|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cQ|nt|mdgraham: yes, you have great spades  |pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|cK|nt|Walddk2: I don't understand, really. You want to show 6 cards rather than 9+|pg||
nt|Walddk2: KISS|pg||
nt|othered1: *+ really|pg||
nt|othered1: 8+ really, that is|pg||
pc|c9|nt|Walddk2: Not if 1NT is NF|pg||
nt|Walddk2: then 2@D shows 9+ cards|pg||
nt|othered1: Was the alerted 1N nonforcing?|pg||
nt|peachy: Was 1NT nonforcing here|pg||
pc|d5|nt|petergill: Might lose trump control now|pg||

nt|rv: can't have everything/be too specific Geoff, at 2 level being passed hand and values in 2 suits, I like fit jump a lot|pg||
nt|roswolf: its mainly a matter of philosophy|pg||
nt|tihana: well in the other room North is SHE, so at least she's aware of it|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, outside your main suit you have two queens. Partner will need an exceptional hand for 5@D to be good |pg||
nt|vugraphzqn: he alerted 1nt...|pg||
nt|peachy: even if it was not a perfect mesh, they would just stay at game level...|pg||
nt|arno11: slam was rather good, many chances to make as @H 2-2  @H finesse, @D 3-3  etc.|pg||

nt|athene: not a textbook 1@D|pg||

nt|marlowepi: normally i agree totally Jeff. i think there is a case, though, for loosening the suit-strength criteria when you are a passed hand. i could go either way on that|pg||
nt|athene: but no-one ever raises minors with five-card support these days so i doubt north will ever own up to a mere Q10 doubleton|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: Filipowicz and Martens won Australia's biggest bridge event earlier this year, and I'm told that they also won the Polish Pairs Championship last year. |pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.pzbs.pl/wyniki/turnieje/2010/pula/team/pulateamleaderb.html  for running scores|pg||
mb|2H|nt|roswolf: nice slam to get to|pg||
nt|athene: that west hand is a classic example of an opening bid which you are supposed to pass after the opponents open (unless they open 1@H, when you can double)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Agreed|pg||
nt|athene: but people like to get into the auction early these days|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|roswolf: 3@C = MAYBE BOTH MAJORS? OR CONTROLS|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Geoff|pg||
nt|peachy: He could not Dbl, so the choices are Pass, 1D, 1S.  Of those, I like 1D|pg||
nt|athene: 1@S is definitely sick|pg||
mb|p|mb|3H|nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: now N is worried that 4C wont be read as forcing|pg||
nt|rv: now North worth 4@c to show fit and extras (I like to play crossing 3n with minor fit shows extras)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: so he may bid 3S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: planning to bid 4C over 3N to reveal intentions|pg||
nt|athene: ok|pg||
nt|peachy: South prob should rebid diamonds, even with shape, he really does not have enough for reverse|pg||
nt|athene: he might have visions of 7@D now, the way the bidding has gone|pg||
nt|athene: north might|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@H would classically be a "reverse" - showing a much stronger hand|pg||
nt|athene: he can pretty much play the hand through in his head|pg||
nt|athene: win the heart or club lead, ruff spades good, draw trumps, get back with the other ace|pg||
nt|athene: Michael Rosenberg has said that when you are in a slam auction you should be trying to play the hand in the bidding|pg||
nt|peachy: So is Dbl...|pg||
nt|othered1: Feels wrong for 1@D, so pass seems clear|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Who says you can't get in later? Look at the CR auction|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Perfect|pg||
nt|athene: yes, west in the other room bid it straight out of the textbook|pg||
nt|othered1: non-space consuming overcalls work better when classic.|pg||
nt|athene: 4@H on a spade lead might be a slight worry?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: often you can see problems - for example if north didn't have BOTH side aces, declarer might be short of an entry for reaching the good spades|pg||
nt|peachy: Ed speaks the truth!|pg||
nt|athene: bidding 1@D meant west actually competed the hand less|pg||
nt|mdgraham: looks like a couple off for a flat board|pg||
nt|othered1: Could be a couple of imps to LMPS here|pg||
mb|4H|nt|roswolf: wasnt 2@D setting up a gf|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: seemy both tables will sell the W hand as strong balanced. I think one could open 1@D|pg||
nt|tomi2: both black suits are stopped but the stops dont run away|pg||
mb|p|nt|tihana: wow|pg||
nt|peachy: wow, North trusted South to actyually have the reverse values|pg||
nt|athene: ok - i apologise for doubting him - he DID show Q10 doubleton!|pg||
nt|athene: well you can't bid much less than 7 after partner reversed|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well done North - influenced by South's reverse, perhaps|pg||
nt|athene: i would have thought it was an underbid if anything|pg||
nt|peachy: exactly, sometimes unconventional bidding pays|pg||
nt|tihana: very different approaches from Grosset and Dombi|pg||
nt|athene: he will probably expect his partner to have that hand but with the @HKQ too so even if the spades can't be used, there will be enough tricks anyway, perhaps with a heart ruff|pg||
nt|peachy: In the other room S did not open, that decision is unusual as well|pg||
nt|athene: yes the diamonds got sort of lost in the other room|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@H goes 1 down but that is still 2 IMPs to the enemy. Not insignificant in an eight-board match|pg||
nt|athene: probably just one down at worst|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: well, if you can make a slam in a suit, someone has to bid the suit at some stage|pg||
nt|peachy: His only line is to develop the spades, so he'll just do that and hope|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you won't bid 7@D if all you bid is spades, clubs, and no-trumps |pg||
nt|athene: http://www.pzbs.pl/wyniki/turnieje/2010/pula/team/pulateamleaderb.html  for running scores|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can make with 4-2 spades - he doesn't need 3-3|pg||
nt|mdgraham: in the other room South resonded 1NT to 1@S. As a passed hand, there doesn't seem much wrong with 2@D  |pg||
nt|athene: but if the spades need two ruffs declarer has only three discards and he needs a heart ruff too|pg||
nt|athene: declarer, understandably, is taking his time|pg||
nt|tihana: a mach with two grands already bid.|pg||
nt|athene: you are a bit worried about spade over-ruffs from west|pg||
nt|athene: if you start ruffing spades high you might find you lose a trump trick if they break 4-1|pg||
nt|tihana: @S3 would be nice lead :)|pg||
nt|othered1: I th ink you hold @C losers to 1 by pitching on @S|pg||
nt|athene: you might have to be careful not to run into a trump promotion on three rounds of spades, @HA, fourth spade perhaps|pg||
pc|d3|nt|petergill: Consus is EW's sponsor - a major company in Poland - Consus is involved in emissions trading schemes or something like that|pg||
nt|rv: if North had min he could have passed 3@c even if 2@d was not setting GF, in my book 4@c should be forcing|pg||
nt|roswolf: or not as the case may be|pg||
pc|d6|nt|marlowepi: N apparently worried that 3rd suit forcing does not set up a GF, or else that his pd wont be sure it does, or else that "GF" auctions can still die at 4m|pg||
pc|dK|nt|roswolf: 3NT IS VERY FORTUNATE|pg||
nt|athene: the defence can't open up the clubs|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|athene: of course declarer has to find the @HJ anyway even without that, not to mention finding ten tricks :)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|roswolf: strong with 5 spades apparently|pg||
pc|c6|nt|roswolf: fell short - indeed not as easy as it seems|pg||
nt|petergill: 4NT RKCB should in my opinion be followed by 5NT by South, to let North know that NS has all the keycards and trump queen|pg||
pc|cK|nt|athene: spade ruff low, @HA, then have a think :)|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps it would have been better to cash the @HA first actually? if you are planning on two spade ruffs and one heart ruff|pg||
nt|athene: you don't ever want to have to overtake a diamond honour from dummy|pg||
nt|athene: or you really are squandering too many big diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: never a wise plan in today's financial climate|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|athene: so maybe @SA, @HA, spade ruff, heart ruff, cash diamond from dummy, spade ruff was better|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c7|pc|dT|nt|roswolf: 12 top tricks|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's on a finesse, not that fortunate|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Must finesse spades to make it|pg||
nt|henryb:  needs the @s finesse. and a little luck in a pointed suit: either 3-3 @s or @d coming home|pg||
nt|jbgood: cllose your eyes and open them again after the spade jack wins:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: but lots off if finesse is wrong|pg||
nt|tomi2: in 5@D you lose two aces but can survive without finesses|pg||
nt|athene: you might even endplay west sometimes and make it, on a very good day|pg||
pc|s9|nt|brolucius: South had the option, presumably, of bidding 5NT after his 4NT. This would tell partner that all the key cards were held and invite him to bid a grand slam. |pg||
nt|peachy: now has to ruff a heart and hope diamonds split|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this line will need 3-2 trumps, as South can't get back to hand after a heart ruff without overtaking, and if he takes a club ruff he can't get back to dummy|pg||
nt|athene: yes, exactly|pg||
nt|athene: i think cashing the @HA at trick 2 was definitely an improvement on this line|pg||
pc|sT|nt|petergill: Then North might bid the grand. |pg||
pc|sJ|nt|athene: he has no options now does he? he can't ever ruff high here|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|roswolf: whereas 5@D is gin|pg||
pc|d4|nt|rv: slam auctions become too diff, if both North and South both want to have Inv bids after South has shown min |pg||
pc|d8|nt|marlowepi: and over 3N, N was worried that if he bid on terorists would kill his children. only explanation i can think of for not bidding 4C over 3N|pg||
pc|d9|nt|athene: for example cash the spades first, THEN club to queen, then club back and duck it to west|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Matches, particularly short ones, are usually won on partscore swings, not straightforward games|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|henryb:  Obviously both 4@h, 4@s and 5@d are all better contracts|pg||
nt|athene: now a small spade from dummy|pg||
pc|s5|nt|athene: puts south under a bit of pressure re. the @S8|pg||
nt|athene: kibitzers are suggesting that north would not cover without the @S8 but i don't think it's that clearcut|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|nt|jbgood: i guess they will bid it -- in the post mortem|pg||
nt|vugraphzqn: small argue befor playing that last one...system problems I think...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Protect your partscore|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|athene: the point is after the opening bid south is marked with most of the points so declarer might perhaps try some sort of chinese finesse|pg||
nt|athene: so north might feel he has to protect against that|pg||
nt|peachy: And South does not know that it actually doesnt matter the way cards lie, but good technique by jerolitsch|pg||
nt|athene: maybe it's all a bit tenuous|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|pc|h4|nt|athene: well, 3@S+2 isn't great in a short match|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h9|pc|hJ|nt|roswolf: like the comment marshall|pg||
nt|athene: protect your partscores and don't have horrible lebensohl misunderstandings :)|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|othered1: That wasn't the best line by declarer.  @CK would have been better play, eventually giving east a chance to make an error by not rising @DQ|pg||

nt|othered1: Mayvbe transfer by east, rebid of 2@S, then over 2N a forcing 3H would let west make a decision east can stand by|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: 4@h as marshall pointed out but in practice may concede 2 hearts, say plays towards Q, then hook for J, just a possibility|pg||

nt|athene: yes of course, i was just talking about 2@S tick vs 2@H not-quite-tick|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 2@C from south i guess|pg||
nt|athene: but of course north won't be interested in anything higher than 2@H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.pzbs.pl/wyniki/turnieje/2010/pula/team/pulateam2leaderb.html  for running scores|pg||
nt|othered1: is east thinking of (garbage) STayman?|pg||
nt|athene: but you don't expect all this (and @HQ too) with west opening a weak-2@S|pg||
nt|peachy: took th bull by the horns|pg||
nt|athene: one area of the game that most partnerships don't discuss nearly enough (i.e. at all) is advancing a 3nt overcall|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not at all clear if south should show his suit|pg||
nt|peachy: true, however general principles could apply. Systems on whenever they can be|pg||
nt|athene: usually problems occur after a 3-level pre-empt when a 3NT overcall can be really wide-ranging|pg||
mb|4D|an|!|nt|vugraphzqn: i think he was...:)|pg||
nt|athene: you aren't weak enough to be bidding it out of fear|pg||
nt|mdgraham: why should he?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 2@C=good raise to 2@H|pg||
nt|athene: and you aren't strong enough to have game interest|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now you can set up your 7th trick in hearts|pg||
nt|athene: so i think 1NT passed is the goldilocks call - just right|pg||
nt|Walddk2: win king and play another one|pg||
nt|mdgraham: an ace and a king don't usually add up to enough for game opposite a strong NT|pg||
nt|othered1: must north capitulate honors with south?|pg||
nt|peachy: including here|pg||
nt|arno11: true, 3N cld easily be based on a running minor and be much better than 4@H..|pg||
mb|6H|nt|marlowepi: it is not a question of "cancelling" a GF. there is a case for allowing "strong" auctions to die at 4m, because not every hand that wants to play 3N if a certain suit is stopped ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: would be thriolled to contract for 11 tricks if it isnt|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so (usually) 2@H is the weakest bid North can make|pg||
nt|athene: east has a lot to say - he has a 1nt bid, a negative double and a club raise|pg||
nt|peachy: I like Dbl|pg||
nt|athene: but clubs are raised even less often than diamonds these days of course|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Ignore that|pg||
nt|fabsayc: good bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: East is one of the world's greatest players. His website is http://www.martensuniversity.com/. |pg||
nt|brolucius: North's 2@H means that he want to go no higher (understandably) if South's major is hearts.|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: it essentially means you are cancelling GF:)|pg||
nt|athene: north's hand gets a lot better when partner has a long suit|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and a practical one|pg||
nt|peachy: Took the bull by the horns, twice in this auction:)|pg||
nt|athene: north can pretty much play the hand in the bidding|pg||
nt|arno11: bidding 4@S vs. the strong NT was worth a game swing on bd 23|pg||
nt|athene: draw trumps whilst ruffing the diamonds good|pg||
nt|athene: loads of entries to his hand (having a 25 count has that effect)|pg||
nt|peachy: heh, Bill :)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|arno11: development not unlucky for NS, but still well done|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|petergill: Martens' books and training are highly recommended - some of his books have been translated into English|pg||
nt|brolucius: South doubles 3@H to tell partner that this is his suit. If he omitted to do this, North might on some auctions bid high in spades, assuming that South held spades.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: a question of wording i guess. you could call it a "conditional game force" too|pg||
nt|roswolf: west probably converted a plus into a minus by bidding 4@H|pg||
pc|hK|nt|peachy: difficult to pass 2H, their last chance for a plus|pg||
pc|h7|nt|athene: 2@H would be interesting but i guess it might go one down|pg||
pc|h3|nt|Walddk2: There is no 7th trick when the spade finesse is off|pg||
nt|athene: small spade from hand is a possible play|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|athene: try to set up the long spade|pg||
pc|hT|nt|brolucius: It seems to me that East's 3@H was a bit risky, since it might have been read as natural (with South's suit not yet known). But West held hearts and did not raise so they clearly ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: knew what they were doing.|pg||
nt|petergill: At least 1100 looks achievable if East can double 2@H for take-out and West converts to penalty|pg||
nt|jbgood: perhaps it would have paid off to double 2 hearts? |pg||
nt|jbgood: unlucky lead|pg||
nt|athene: would be touch and go between one down and making|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hJ|pc|s9|pg||
pc|d2|nt|brolucius: Perhaps that would have shown hearts?|pg||
nt|petergill: At both tables, the vulnerable penalty was not taken|pg||
nt|peachy: this was not an easy hand for East|pg||
nt|athene: it doesn't help to cash the diamonds throwing the hearts away - south can ruff and still make a trump trick|pg||
pc|d6|nt|vugraphzqn: ...REALLY TOO FAST...SRY|pg||
nt|othered1: In the CR, looks like east essentially did treat the hand as "garbage" Stayman.|pg||
nt|peachy: good discard|pg||
pc|dA|nt|jbgood: even clearer to double by E in the other room...|pg||
nt|petergill: I think 2HX is only 1100 - trump promotion for 1400 is not available, I think|pg||
nt|athene: the alternative way to play this sort of 1NT contract is to lead clubs|pg||
nt|athene: that can have two benefits|pg||
nt|athene: firstly it might cause the defence to attack other suits you want them to|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dJ|nt|athene: but even if they don't do that it can tighten up the position for endplays without losing too many tricks|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d9|pg||
pc|d3|nt|roswolf: 1100 is never bad|pg||
pc|s4|pc|h5|nt|rv: West 's hand is tempting to pass 3n, I generally like to pass with 4333 and min hand|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|athene: 6@H was not a wild bid at all - as can be judged from the fact that south couldn't really have any less and this is making an overtrick|pg||
pc|c5|nt|henryb:  unluckier shift|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cA|nt|petergill: The top Italians would just overcall 1@H on the grounds that the flat 6322 shape (no singleton nor void) is unsuitable for vulnerable premption. |pg||

nt|athene: a victory for the weak notrump there - it was really hard for NS to come in |pg||
nt|othered1: how did 4@S go doen?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: depends, i play 2nt over 2M to force and ask shape|pg||
nt|fabsayc: ignore that, was answering a question|pg||
mb|1C|nt|vugraphpl2: pozdrawiamy kibicow|pg||
nt|mdgraham: unusual score from board 7 in the other room - 4@Hxx+1, 1480|pg||
nt|athene: double spade hook maybe|pg||
nt|athene: (run the ten from hand)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: sorry run the ten from the SOUTH hand :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, declarer cashed @SA at some point|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not the best line|pg||
nt|Walddk2: that was not such a good idea as he also had to ruff two diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: this particular suit combination gives you lots of possibilities|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1H|nt|vugraphpl2: Gajcyk zapytal vugrafa czy idzi 4 ale pas|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: EW did really well in the other room|pg||
mb|2H|nt|petergill: Martens is ranked 47th best player in the world by the WBF. His photo and WBF results are at http://worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=1140|pg||
nt|roswolf: very restained by west|pg||
nt|athene: if the defence had started spade to the ace, spade ruff, east would have had a horrible dilemma|pg||
nt|athene: you might lead small from the ace and if east plays low, put in the ten, and if that loses to the jack, run the queen, on the basis that east wouldn't duck with @SKx|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You can't look at the spade suit in isolation, Bill|pg||
nt|othered1: But the possiblilites are limited by other considerations on the actual hands.|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: whether to underlead for the second ruff|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You need diamond ruffs|pg||
nt|athene: yes sure|pg||
nt|athene: still, it looks as though you really should make the hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: this is strong version of Polish @c, 18+any strength|pg||
nt|athene: not sure i like 1@H but i guess if you play canapé 1@H openers, why not overcalls too? :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: 4@C splinter|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i am having trouble understanding the auction to slam in the other room: 3C-5C-6C |pg||
pc|s3|nt|athene: @CA, @HAK to pitch the club, then play diamonds|pg||
nt|Walddk2: certainly|pg||
pc|s5|nt|vugraphpl2: zadumal sie i mruczy cos pod nosem:)|pg||
nt|athene: with the stakes at 4@HXX :)|pg||
nt|athene: this should be a nice simple auction - maybe west will ask for the @CK|pg||
nt|arno11: :)|pg||
nt|athene: but if west just didn't know what to do, that suggests he needs to discuss defence to polish 1@C |pg||
pc|sA|nt|jbgood: a very cautious comment ...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that would be good, and is a useful meaning of 5N in this kind of auction |pg||
nt|athene: but really how can he not have that?|pg||
nt|athene: one thing about polish club is that people playing it open 1@C a LOT|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|vugraphzqn: w question S about that 2@s...|pg||
nt|vugraphzqn: strong with supp|pg||
nt|athene: but if you go for some sort of crossruff you might run into too many overruffs in hearts perhaps|pg||
nt|athene: so you really need to know what you are doing over it|pg||
nt|arno11: interesting contract but 2 will be easy|pg||
nt|peachy: was 1D a transfer, or some point count range?|pg||
nt|athene: 1@D negative|pg||
nt|athene: or might be some strong hands but usually negative|pg||
nt|peachy: ty, I am not that familiar with Polish Club|pg||
nt|athene: if they are playing normal Polish|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sK|nt|othered1: which is what declarer in CR did, but he played @SA before ruffing @D and things came apart from there|pg||
pc|s4|nt|rv: 2@h shows 4@h <11 hcp|pg||
nt|roswolf: i missed an ace - ihave enough for game - i found another ace - easy peasey|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|rv: 2@d is artificial setting GF, 3@h shows fit|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes would work splendidly if pd raised to 5C preemptive;y|pg||
nt|marlowepi: to ic his own, i guess|pg||
nt|fabsayc: denies 7 points with 4 card major, can be some flat hands that are stronger|pg||
nt|arno11: low @D ?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|athene: yes, cashing the @SA is certainly mad|pg||
nt|athene: well perhaps not mad, but sub-optimal let's say |pg||
nt|Walddk2: diamond ducked now|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mdgraham: plus there may be an element of if-you-can-bid-a-grand then so-can-we|pg||
pc|h3|nt|athene: west can count 12 tricks|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|athene: doesn't bid 7nt because you might need to ruff the clubs good, or ruff a spade in the east hand, for the thirteenth trick|pg||
nt|mdgraham: good flat board|pg||
pc|s6|nt|rv: 2H is apparently 4 cards and 7-9|pg||
pc|h6|pc|s8|nt|roswolf: indeed - luck beats skill some days at least|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|athene: not an easy contract|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d3|pc|dA|nt|jbgood: will he find the single club ace for the overtrick?|pg||
nt|athene: hard to keep trump control to use the diamonds|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|petergill: Dominik Filipowicz is much younger than Martens|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2@H showed a minimum hand (in response to the take-out double), so the 4@C splinter bid was pushing it a bit. Could have been a slam there, I suppose.|pg||
nt|athene: but you have too big a diamond fit to go for a crossruff comfortably|pg||
pc|d2|nt|petergill: I agree about the "pushing it a bit"|pg||
nt|othered1: you do have pretty good trump pips.  Losing both high @S on overruffs, plus the @S7 would be cruel.|pg||
nt|peachy: I have had lots of help from kibitzers, re 1D response : (0-7 any or 12-15 without major 4 ,possible 7-9 on minor without good bid|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dT|nt|roswolf: doubt it|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|athene: once you know west can't overruff diamonds you should be OK |pg||
pc|dQ|pc|h5|nt|jbgood: yes!|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c3|nt|othered1: now if east overruffs, he can't pull trumps|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cA|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed wrong again:(:)|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h7|pc|h2|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|rv: wp, he didn't fall for @c finesse|pg||
nt|athene: yes, cashing the @SA allows east to go overruff, @SK, spade|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2 ways of making it now|pg||
nt|mdgraham: heart ruff with @SA|pg||
nt|athene: which tends to puncture your happy crossruff balloon|pg||
pc|c4|pc|s9|nt|Walddk2: Spade to the ace and @D10|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|othered1: only overruff, @S.  remember ace was played already|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|c8|nt|Walddk2: or as declarer did|pg||

pc|d8|pc|c9|pc|c7|pc|c6|pg||
pc|d9|pc|cQ|pc|cK|pc|cT|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Thanks Tomislav, great operating!|pg||
nt|vugraphzqn: last board of this match...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: slammish|pg||
nt|athene: a good lesson from that hand - many people feel it's safer to cash just one round of trumps, but that can often allow a defender to draw a killing second (or third) round later on|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: drawing just one round of trumps rarely stops a damaging ruff since it's unlikely a defender has ruffing potential and a singleton trump|pg||
nt|arno11: 6@C a make here with trumps 3-2|pg||
mb|1S|nt|brolucius: At least his singleton was in the suit that had been overcalled, which suggested that partner's values would be in the other three suits - just where they were needed.|pg||
nt|rv: thx Tomislav, continue the great job|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Anyone for 4@C now?|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt possible from west now|pg||
nt|othered1: Penalty doubles anyone?|pg||
nt|peachy: Not sure if anyone plays Dbl there is penalty|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphpl2: gajcyk chcial grac 2@d z X|pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks a push in 4@H|pg||
nt|petergill: Consus Oil's sponsorship of bridge is thanks to Piotr Wasiak, I think |pg||
nt|rv: this is weak bal nt version of Polish @c|pg||
nt|athene: of course east might have had @SAxxx @HAQxx @DQxx @CAK :) but in that case it's just not your day|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They do not exist below 7@H, Ed|pg||
nt|othered1: Some of us do.|pg||
nt|athene: if west does bid 3nt, east's excitement will be lessened, as he knows there are wasted club cards opposite|pg||
nt|athene: if west had shown a good spade raise, east would not have stopped below about lotsof@S|pg||
nt|peachy: for those interested in the beer http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_card|pg||
nt|arno11: also 6NT on the lucky lie of the @D suit...|pg||
mb|3C|an|!|nt|brolucius: North might consider a slam opposite a 2NT opening, but not opposite a strong 1NT.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: you might open 1@H with that, not 1@C|pg||
nt|mdgraham: unless 5cM, of course|pg||
nt|fabsayc: south could have treated his hand by opening 1c and jumping in spades|pg||
nt|fabsayc: perhaps a little shy in sure tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzqn: thx Martin, Arno, Raija and Walter...thx Roland and kibbs...:)|pg||
nt|athene: is 3@C invitational? seems a bit strong if so|pg||
mb|4S|nt|rv: 13-15 bal|pg||
nt|peachy: I like 3NT, even with spade support|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: polish standards for 2 over 1 overcalls are quiet low, I would pass that hand. qtz73 cries for trapping pass and reopening double|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3nt is a fair shot here|pg||
nt|othered1: But why was it alerted?|pg||
nt|athene: yes, 4333 is notrump shape|pg||
nt|athene: we know that east feels that way - on board 9 he chose 3nt with 4333 when his partner had five spades|pg||
nt|athene: so it's good to see the partnership is in tune :)|pg||
nt|othered1: Looks like 6@S making 5, 3N making 6.  Odd.|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: hmmm - i was expecting south to say he had a minimum, which isn't usually 3nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: Heading for a flat board here|pg||
nt|peachy: depends on what 2NT asked|pg||
nt|mdgraham: maybe by the NS standards that isn't a minimum - in which case, I'd like to see one|pg||
nt|fabsayc: either way this is an absolute maximum 1@S opener in polish club|pg||
nt|peachy: Thank you TOmislav, great job as operator, much appreciated|pg||
nt|arno11: making 5 for a flat board|pg||
nt|vugraphzqn: and William ofcourse...:)|pg||
pc|d6|nt|roswolf: e/w in the other room did well to find 5@C|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i am guessing RD by S would show a better hand|pg||
nt|athene: that's really a pretty bad hand for a second-seat weak 2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it's that extra club trick|pg||
nt|arno11: thx everyone, nice close match|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dT|nt|petergill: Consus just scored another big swing|pg||
nt|rv: I would have bid 1@h with North or XX from South as SOS instead of 1@d|pg||

pc|dA|pg||
nt|vugraphpl2: odpytuja sie z systemu|pg||
nt|tomi2: and if we make game, i pass and west will pass to, partner will reopen with double or 1nt. if he cant reopen we are favortes to have no game on|pg||
nt|tihana: 3N is a beuty |pg||
pc|sA|nt|jbgood: it doesnt always work that way, Thomas, so I must admit I would bid 2@h|pg||
pc|s6|nt|rv: yes maybe XX by South shows a strong variety of Polish @c|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and smile....|pg||
nt|tihana: buc|pg||
nt|athene: it's certainly getting more beautiful by the minute|pg||
nt|othered1: Really the lead consideration, and that emphasizes the benefit of 3N, not to mention thatnorth may be ready to ruff @C|pg||
nt|athene: north will no doubt be happy to find his "costly" lead didn't cost at all|pg||
nt|athene: he just lost the same 12 imps either way :)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|marlowepi: 2C by E seems excessively modest|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|c2|pc|s7|pg||
nt|jbgood: fortunately bridge players have different approaches - else it would be a dull game|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: almost certainly 6 hearts minimum for the 4H bid|pg||
nt|marlowepi: a good 6C will be missed here|pg||
nt|othered1: OK, could well be|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|haans: Im on Eds side hard to find 6@H at that board|pg||
nt|othered1: They may not play 2/1, but south is playing north for a very good hand, and I doubt 3N showed extras.|pg||
nt|haans: 6@C looks best here|pg||
nt|othered1: yes, 6@C, but how do you get there intelligently after the jump rebid?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: S has already done a lot with 3S -- he has a substandard suit for that call, and no club honor|pg||
nt|haans: after 4nt = bid again and slam it is|pg||
nt|othered1: That was my thought.  ONce he chose to bid out his values, he could consider himself done.|pg||
nt|haans: pass acceptable|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|marlowepi: i dont agree. even in non-2/1 the most likely hand type for S is solid spades, and in that case 4N may have been a bit of a stretch. If N goes on over 4N, he should bid 5C to ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: suggest slam|pg||
nt|othered1: And even in some versions of 2/1, a jump rebid doesn't have to be a solid suit.  Some like to get their general hand type in early to avoid the 2/1 traps.|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c3|pc|c2|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c7|pc|cT|nt|marlowepi: 5C over 4N would be a strong slam invitation. otherwise pass 4N, since N has already shown willingness to play NT|pg||
nt|othered1: Not much difference between this and a high reverse after a 2/1.  YOu can play it to show shape or to show extras, even after partner has forced to game.|pg||

nt|roswolf: here definitely strong!|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 1@D is 0-7|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes i agree, but italian style takeout double lands on feet once again|pg||
nt|roswolf: agreed rv|pg||
pc|hA|nt|brolucius: West decides he is not worth anything stronger than 4@H (such as 4@C, splinter) because East limited his hand with the 1@D response.|pg||
pc|h4|nt|roswolf: and a diamond switch!?|pg||
nt|tomi2: they send two teams to Pula it seems. North is Krzystof Martens, he wrote several books in the past years, if you are an advanced or expert player and want to improve your game, ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: think about his books|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, they have a better fit in hearts :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 15 and 16 first, followed by comparisons from the other table when we circle back to board 9|pg||
pc|h3|nt|henryb:  3@c goes down 4, which is even better than the lucky slam|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@S can still be a weak NT and is forcing|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@H obviously confirms the 18+ hand|pg||
pc|hK|nt|roswolf: yes the italians have a lot to answer for|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Down 1 not too bad, N-S can make some diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|peachy: The other commentators for this match are Bill Frisby, England, and Raija Davis USA|pg||
pc|h6|nt|peachy: declare needs to pay spades for one loser. Or else get rid of a diamond loser, to make|pg||
nt|athene: i would just transfer and then bid 3nt with that west hand|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|roswolf: trump is even better|pg||
pc|h2|nt|arno11: Iris Grümm has always been a member of the austrian ladies team in recent years, Stefan is a former junior internationalist, both in their late twenties|pg||
nt|athene: maybe south thought his partner showed two hearts rather than four|pg||
pc|c3|pc|h9|nt|rv: this rates to be 1 down, can NS manoeur a @c ruff as well, now unlikely|pg||
nt|mdgraham: defence will get a spade ruff, but to no avail|pg||
nt|athene: no way to beat this - east could start with the spade lead but then if he tried underleading the club for a second ruff he would be sadly disappointed|pg||
nt|athene: i don't think you want to offer clubs with a minimum 5422|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed but east took a normal view i think|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you cant stand a 2D response and a huge chunk of your stuff is in their suit -- a defensive hand-type when they open 1S really|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Oh well, they are getting too many trump tricks now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We all agree re the double|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|nt|tomi2: As far as I remember this Consus squad won Australian Nationals earlier this year|pg||
nt|henryb:  At this vulnerability, I think you either have to look for slam or defend|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I agree- prospects of 6@C probably remote|pg||
nt|athene: and 5@C is very rarely going to be better than 3nt|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s6|pg||
nt|roswolf: but with 4 cards in the other major not too yucky|pg||
nt|marlowepi: both red is the worst conditions for this double -- both sides might go down in hundreds|pg||
mc|10|nt|Walddk2: There is a first time for everything, all 4 commentators agree|pg||

nt|athene: if north actually had a diamond ruff coming, and four hearts, it might be sensible to show THREE hearts|pg||
nt|athene: then there's no chance south will try to give a heart ruff rather than a diamond ruff|pg||

mb|1N|nt|haans: win some lose some|pg||
nt|othered1: 6 of a minor, when right, is a large matchpoint and imp gatherer.  About same as 4-3 fits when they're best.|pg||

nt|roswolf: perhaps|pg||
nt|roswolf: did someone pull out a plug?rehi all|pg||
nt|roswolf: this might get feisty|pg||
nt|fabsayc: bidding strongly suggested 4 hearts with declarer where not possible|pg||
mb|1H|an|!|nt|peachy: suits aren splitting friendly in this hand|pg||
nt|athene: most people would open the north hand 1@S - 2@S is ok if that's what it shows|pg||
nt|othered1: that's a normal result, if east doesn't make the non-restricted choice decision had north played @SJ on second round.|pg||
nt|athene: well, people treat 6-4 as a 1-suiter, sometimes|pg||
nt|arno11: EW are using a kind of Blue Club system, so strong club  4 card majors and canapé (shorter suit first in some situations)|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: how loudly can east pass 1@S?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|vugraphzqn: ...sry all..lost conection..:(|pg||
nt|roswolf: aggressive opening by north|pg||
nt|peachy: in light opening style, North will open|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@D showing diamonds, a rare bird on this side of the pond|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's as good as anything in my view|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: if they bid 6@S (unlikely) west had better keep his fingers off that @DA|pg||
nt|fabsayc: EW probably make 6@D, but will they get there|pg||
mb|2D|nt|mdgraham: not uncommon in England, maybe in places like Norway where they like Ekren |pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  Must not have weak 2 available|pg||
nt|rv: 3rd seat pre-empt can be wide ranging for most partnerships|pg||
nt|athene: a very surprising pass from east - i would have thought it was simply a choice between double and 2@H (i woudl double)|pg||
nt|athene: if you play Lebensohl then 3@S is forcing (with an invitational hand south would bid 2nt then 3@S)|pg||
nt|arno11: 1@H is 11-16, 4+ cards can have 4 cards+ a longer suit that´s why alerted|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=3308  Iris Grümm, pretty young woman|pg||
nt|athene: it's always very tough, when one person has shortage in his partner's first-bid suit, to find out whether there are wasted values there|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so this is blue team ew then, arno?|pg||
nt|arno11: 2@D 9 cards in both directions so could be 4@H 5@D or the other way round|pg||
mb|4D|nt|brolucius: South does not double because 1@C is artificial.|pg||
nt|roswolf: a weak 2 is very strong by today's standards|pg||
nt|marlowepi: double?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ah|pg||
nt|mdgraham: oops|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, thousands play Multi|pg||
nt|peachy: Or some polish versions, or Ekren's etc.|pg||
nt|athene: ouch|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, all you can say here is that South thought 3@S was forcing and North didn't|pg||
nt|vugraphzqn: I think some misunderstand here...S look angry...|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: very disciplined pass over 1@s by East|pg||
nt|athene: i think north might have thought they didn't play lebenshl here|pg||
nt|athene: there is less reason for it after you double 2@D|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.pzbs.pl/wyniki/turnieje/2010/pula/team/pulateam2leaderb.html  for running scores|pg||
nt|athene: because mostly with a weak hand you are bidding 2major|pg||
nt|arno11: yes Martin at least as far as I know :)|pg||
nt|athene: now when west doesn't cue 4@H, that is music to east's ears|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Blue Club is only alive in Austria I think. Fischer-Saurer also play it, don't they?|pg||
mb|5D|nt|roswolf: dont like the 1nt - i would double having both majors|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2NT may show good clubs |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphpl2: ale klotni nie ma atmosfera dalej ok|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: i think a polish 1@C should be assumed to be natural-ish and defend accordingly|pg||
nt|athene: there's such a fine line between "disciplined" and "wet" :)|pg||
nt|athene: 2nt is just natural by the look of it|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes. You might not like 2@H, but double is possible|pg||
nt|peachy: If playing sound overcalls, E suit is not good enough.  Opposite passed partner, I think it is just conservative, not quite "wet"|pg||
nt|athene: south might just bid 3nt now anyway|pg||
nt|athene: those tens and nines are all quite nice|pg||
nt|mdgraham: wouldn't mind double|pg||
nt|athene: ok, maybe she doesn't like music :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|arno11: Fischer Saurer are playing 5 card majors and strong 1@C|pg||
pc|cT|nt|roswolf: dont understand east's pass over 4@S|pg||
nt|arno11: the austrian ladies pairs are mostly playing Blue Club, so anyone can play with anyone|pg||
nt|fabsayc: here the second/fourth lead tells declarer club finesse working|pg||
nt|vugraphzqn: 2/4 leads|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.pzbs.pl/wyniki/turnieje/2010/pula/team/pulateam2leaderb.html  for running scores|pg||
nt|athene: well, unless it's a singleton lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 96 teams were divided into 24 groups of 4. Three rounds of qualifying, and then Swiss|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is Swiss 3, last match today|pg||
nt|peachy: with such distributional hands, club could easily be singleton|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6 more tomorrow|pg||
nt|athene: the Poles lead differently from everyone else from most suit combinations, but they have to follow the rest of the world with a singleton :)|pg||
nt|arno11: forgot Fucik and Purkarthofer and wife and husband Terraneo (Franz + Sylvia) who played Blue-Club for Austria in Ostend|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|brolucius: Yes.|pg||
nt|rv: not sure if X meant anything specific, possibly East felt he had unstated strength|pg||
pc|c7|nt|peachy: West's choices for opening lead, difficult|pg||
nt|athene: no way to beat this - declarer will just plot away at the clubs|pg||
nt|athene: *plod away|pg||
nt|fabsayc: do they lead singleton?|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|tomi2: dont know what systems they use, but Martnes is fan of a system with very weak openings w/r and strong club while vulnerable he prefers to play natural openings|pg||
nt|athene: with @HAK @CAK off the hand declarer knows he needs a certain amount of good fortune, but it's all forthcoming|pg||
nt|Walddk2: With the left hand. Nice gadget|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Don't you all do that?|pg||

nt|arno11: http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=3308    Iris Grümm|pg||
nt|athene: i guess you try to set up the spades|pg||
nt|fabsayc: left handed people don't|pg||
nt|athene: using the clubs as entry to dummy|pg||
nt|arno11: http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=13996    and her partner :)|pg||
nt|athene: playing the @CJ at trick 1 might have been a deceptive move in case the lead was a singleton - south might not be able to read it|pg||
nt|athene: but it does mean you can't get two club entries to dummy|pg||
nt|athene: if north is sufficiently well-read to insert the king on the @C5 lead|pg||
pc|sK|nt|brolucius: North-South have sold out too cheaply, really. They have half the points and a 4-4 spade fit.|pg||
nt|jbgood: a steal for sure|pg||
nt|rv: not best defense|pg||
pc|sA|pc|d5|nt|athene: if the defence had attacked hearts right from the start they would be threatening to set up east's long heart before declarer got the clubs going, but south could change plans and ...|pg||
nt|athene: go for the diamonds and spades - with both finesses working he would have nine tricks without any clubs|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|d6|nt|tomi2: this hand seems to be the reason.|pg||
pc|c4|pc|dJ|pc|d4|pg||
nt|athene: but with a solid 5-5 trump fit you aren't usually all that worried about entries|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s3|nt|vugraphpl2: gajcyk wypytuje o sekwencje zrzutek|pg||
pc|dK|nt|rv: East's X should have possibly enabled West to defend hand more accurately, he knew partner has most of unseen values|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i guess it was a pealty double of 3H. unlucky they ran|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 10@H right, @dK right |pg||
nt|athene: and the @SQ|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|peachy: everything right :)|pg||
nt|athene: finessing looks like the best play here|pg||
nt|peachy: while he is  thinking:   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Istria.png  Pula is located by the beautiful Adriatic Sea|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this is the sort of hand the opposition always make aganst you - off course you go about two off|pg||
nt|athene: there are some layouts where it would be wrong but nothing like as many|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|roswolf: yes that is why double was better - the flexible friend|pg||
pc|cK|nt|jbgood: they would have to fight over 3 clubs then - not easy|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: ok, perhaps declarer decided that west would not lead from @SQxxx - so he either has five, or he doesn't have the queen|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|athene: if he has @SQxxxx and no entry you are safe to rise @SA|pg||

pc|s8|nt|henryb:  Since E-W make 3@c and can beat 3@s, what's the signicant difference?|pg||
nt|roswolf: DID this really happen?|pg||
nt|rv: East's X ideally should be t/o of @s with max of pre-empt, doesn't make sense to show "I have good and lots of @hs"|pg||
pc|c6|nt|jbgood: and only one down ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmmmmmmmmm|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: there was another consideration - he might think that west wouldn't give him a working spade finesse he couldn't take for himself|pg||

pc|s3|nt|marlowepi: his original pass might suggest he intended to pass a reopening double of 1S..but he didnt want to defend 2SX|pg||
nt|othered1: East obviously has a huge trap pass, which might have touted south off the lead|pg||
nt|haans: that double may not be a pen double|pg||
