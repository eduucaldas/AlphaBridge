nt|tomi2: this auction will not be duplicated here. Polish pairs play 1@D as negative over (1@C)-x-(p)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.pzbs.pl/wyniki/turnieje/2010/pula/team/pulateamleaderb.html  for running scores|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is a nasty hand for n/s|pg||
nt|rv: yes agree Marshall even playing raptor, X seems a good option|pg||
nt|athene: a good slam here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Leb me here, Rump be there. Too much can go wrong|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I repeat, KISS|pg||
nt|athene: yes, south's best line of defence is to throw a small spade, looking shifty|pg||
nt|athene: like a man baring an honour|pg||
nt|vugraphzqn: ...welcome back...sry...some small problems...|pg||
nt|petergill: Ben Handley-Pritchard's old partner Richard Probst once told me that Pula is a great resort and that one day I should go there then visit Plitvice National Park then wander down to ...|pg||
nt|petergill: Split and Dubrovnik. |pg||
mb|1N|nt|mdgraham: this looks a reasonable slam|pg||
nt|athene: unusual to play 3nt with a 5-4 major fit and unbalanced hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: needs to study body language of poker players|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 6@S needs 3-2 spades and no club ruff most of the time|pg||
mb|2C|an|!|nt|tomi2: ok over 1@D this does not work|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: north mustnt get too carried away with his points|pg||
nt|brolucius: Krakow is a beautiful mediaeval city, where the restaurants serve a lot of game dishes, such as venison. A great place for a week's holiday.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: NS obviously not Precision, so it looks like 1@D was natural on the previous hand|pg||
mb|2D|nt|peachy: same auction so far as in Closed Room|pg||
nt|mdgraham: good barrage|pg||
nt|tihana: S doesnt need much from p|pg||
nt|athene: south might just wheel out blackwood now, trusting his partner to have little wastage in diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: i think that is the practical decision|pg||
nt|athene: rare to see a 1@S response on this sort of hand|pg||
nt|athene: most people wheel out their trusty GF-major-raise, whatever it may be|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: do you bid 1@S or 1@H with north hand? and why?|pg||
nt|rv: 1@c is 3 way here|pg||
nt|peachy: 2S likely final contract here, unless NS interfere and push them to game|pg||
mb|2N|nt|roswolf: nor must west!!!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good evening to Peter Gill|pg||
nt|roswolf: what was 1nt supposed to be?|pg||
nt|petergill: Hi|pg||
nt|athene: wow|pg||
nt|arno11: has bid 2@C as no other way to invite is possible|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: normal-looking stuff|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't like 2@S one bit|pg||
nt|athene: a heavy 2@S bid for sure|pg||
nt|petergill: I think Ben H-P is having a reunion with old friends in Pula - his country is not really Reunion|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: to me 3D is hasty -- you might have a heart game. with this shape and nobody bidding spades, it is unlikely opps can outbid you, so go slow. if they bid more clubs, diamonds still ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: rank higher|pg||
nt|tihana: hihi|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@S is a rubber bridge bid|pg||
nt|mdgraham: any reason for not liking 2@S, Roland?|pg||
nt|othered1: What do you bid?  2@D?   Limited opening bid systems handle this hand better.\|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But the flag is colourful|pg||
nt|vugraphzqn: his countryes are Croatia and England...|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: certainly you have to give partner a bit of slack since 3@S was bid under pressure and hence it's a "good 2@S bid up to a mediocre 3@S bid" - with a good 3@S bid north should just ...|pg||
nt|athene: bid game - but even so|pg||
nt|tihana: South should go to bed at 8 :) |pg||
nt|athene: well 2@D is more flexible|pg||
pc|h5|nt|jbgood: north is wondering who has the spades . if prd has them, he must be very weak|pg||
nt|henryb:  More to the point, do you make a takeout double of 1@d with South or remain a churchmouse, silent and waiting|pg||
nt|roswolf: i bid 1@H "UP THE LINE"|pg||
pc|h3|nt|roswolf: fair comment|pg||
nt|rv: I would have bid 2@h on 1@d O/C to show @hs and @ds, fit showing jump|pg||
nt|rv: instead of 3@d by East|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes for me 3@D would show a worthless hand |pg||
nt|athene: a very nice fit and the heart onside means three overtricks i think, if declarer plays it flat out|pg||
nt|fabsayc: can pick up 2 imps for making seven|pg||
pc|h7|nt|arno11: declarer might make all the tricks with @H s as trumps so a couple of imps back|pg||
nt|petergill: I will back the defence to beat 2NT|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|roswolf: this should be a cakewalk|pg||
pc|c5|nt|athene: flexible being the F-word that roland approves of :)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|roswolf: heart suit quality not good enough for me for a fit jump|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c9|pg||
nt|tomi2: dont understand easts pass here. ater not selling out to 1@S and a raise by partner Game should be a good shot|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but spades is really where you live|pg||
nt|Walddk2: OK, we'll create an Engcro flag next time|pg||
pc|h4|nt|Walddk2: Yes, I bid 2@D. We could be cold for 5@D for all I know|pg||
nt|athene: you can't ruff two diamonds in dummy without east overruffing though so perhaps 12 is the limit|pg||
pc|hK|nt|athene: not when partner has @DKJxxx / @Sx|pg||
nt|peachy: With 6-4 and not a bad hand, opener rebids 2D, and bad hand 2S.  Matter of what opener evaluated, I think|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h8|pg||
nt|peachy: In the other room, it was South who bid 4D, thast could have excited North at least a little|pg||
pc|c6|nt|athene: you don't like it when you get pre-empted out of a slam, but you like it less when you get pre-empting into a slam which doesn't make|pg||
pc|c4|nt|fabsayc: 13 is cold with diamonds 33|pg||
nt|petergill: I'm still backing the defence to win the race, narrowly|pg||
nt|petergill: @CA I think, as north having a bare honour is more likely than KQ with South|pg||
pc|cT|nt|marlowepi: even if it is invitational in their methods i think it is both an underbid and tactically injudicious. |pg||
nt|roswolf: another push|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|jbgood: agree - 3 NT should be a good shot|pg||
pc|sK|nt|petergill: Declarer should flatten the board|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You do in USA, that is not mainstream in Europe|pg||
nt|arno11: need to ruff only 1 diamond as they break 3-3|pg||
nt|arno11: in the other room Nord switched to @D 10 after the @C 9 so 8 tricks were there|pg||
pc|s5|nt|Walddk2: When you have 2 suits, bid them|pg||
nt|peachy: oooh, that I did not know. THank you|pg||
nt|athene: some people always show the 4-card suit - i believe larry cohen wrote an article on it where he said that Berkowitz ALWAYS showed the lower-ranking suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The idea is that it must be more relevant for partner to know at least 9 cards rather than 6|pg||
nt|athene: ah yes sorry apologies|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s3|pg||
nt|othered1: They play Precision, which changes things|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That is simple logic|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: of course you only need one diamond ruff :)|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|peachy: To me, when the discrepancy of suit quality os as great as it is here. I like 2S|pg||
nt|othered1: They = Cohen Berkowitz|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hA|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, you have great spades  |pg||
nt|petergill: Makes no difference that Iris played differently in @Cs from what I would have done|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|nt|Walddk2: I don't understand, really. You want to show 6 cards rather than 9+|pg||
nt|Walddk2: KISS|pg||
nt|othered1: *+ really|pg||
nt|othered1: 8+ really, that is|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|Walddk2: Not if 1NT is NF|pg||
nt|Walddk2: then 2@D shows 9+ cards|pg||
nt|othered1: Was the alerted 1N nonforcing?|pg||
nt|peachy: Was 1NT nonforcing here|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|petergill: Might lose trump control now|pg||
pc|hT|pc|d3|nt|petergill: Ruffing a club without cashing @SA is better as the cards lie |pg||
pc|c2|pc|d6|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.pzbs.pl/wyniki/turnieje/2010/pula/team/pulateam2leaderb.html  for running scores|pg||
pc|s8|nt|petergill: @D10 switch can be called "highly imaginative". Playing back what partner led is what dreary players like me do|pg||

nt|rv: can't have everything/be too specific Geoff, at 2 level being passed hand and values in 2 suits, I like fit jump a lot|pg||
nt|roswolf: its mainly a matter of philosophy|pg||
nt|tihana: well in the other room North is SHE, so at least she's aware of it|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, outside your main suit you have two queens. Partner will need an exceptional hand for 5@D to be good |pg||
nt|vugraphzqn: he alerted 1nt...|pg||
nt|peachy: even if it was not a perfect mesh, they would just stay at game level...|pg||
nt|arno11: slam was rather good, many chances to make as @H 2-2  @H finesse, @D 3-3  etc.|pg||
nt|peachy: Any method to show GF heart raise would have been enough|pg||
nt|athene: do you open that south hand 1@C, treating it as balanced?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5-5, maybe this will go to a tie-break|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You watching tennis, Peter?|pg||
mb|1D|nt|roswolf: can they gei to the grand|pg||
nt|athene: it doesn't look like a 2@C opener even if you play that as possible 5 clubs 4 major|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphpl2: dyskusja o poprzednim rozdaniu|pg||
nt|athene: 7@D here, if you want it enough|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it depends what you respond on x  xx  AKxxxxx Jxx, for example |pg||
nt|athene: not a textbook 1@D|pg||
mb|1H|nt|arno11: 4@H likely contract here|pg||
nt|athene: more major-suit fits eschewed in favour of 3NT on this one in the other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: grands are rarely "easy" ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I like one of the team names in Group U, "She goes to bed at 8"   :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: normally i agree totally Jeff. i think there is a case, though, for loosening the suit-strength criteria when you are a passed hand. i could go either way on that|pg||
nt|athene: but no-one ever raises minors with five-card support these days so i doubt north will ever own up to a mere Q10 doubleton|pg||
nt|petergill: The Croatian-English defence was fine - that sounds like a Chess play|pg||
mb|2C|nt|petergill: Filipowicz and Martens won Australia's biggest bridge event earlier this year, and I'm told that they also won the Polish Pairs Championship last year. |pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.pzbs.pl/wyniki/turnieje/2010/pula/team/pulateamleaderb.html  for running scores|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: nice slam to get to|pg||
nt|athene: that west hand is a classic example of an opening bid which you are supposed to pass after the opponents open (unless they open 1@H, when you can double)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Agreed|pg||
nt|athene: but people like to get into the auction early these days|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Trump lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: 3@C = MAYBE BOTH MAJORS? OR CONTROLS|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Geoff|pg||
nt|peachy: He could not Dbl, so the choices are Pass, 1D, 1S.  Of those, I like 1D|pg||
nt|athene: 1@S is definitely sick|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You don't even have to look at your cards|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Just find a small trump|pg||
nt|petergill: Not watching - but yesterday's Sydney newspaper had a long interview with Caroline Wozniacki the great Dane who is seeded  1|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c7|nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: now N is worried that 4C wont be read as forcing|pg||
nt|rv: now North worth 4@c to show fit and extras (I like to play crossing 3n with minor fit shows extras)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: so he may bid 3S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: planning to bid 4C over 3N to reveal intentions|pg||
nt|athene: ok|pg||
nt|peachy: South prob should rebid diamonds, even with shape, he really does not have enough for reverse|pg||
nt|athene: he might have visions of 7@D now, the way the bidding has gone|pg||
nt|athene: north might|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@H would classically be a "reverse" - showing a much stronger hand|pg||
nt|athene: he can pretty much play the hand through in his head|pg||
nt|athene: win the heart or club lead, ruff spades good, draw trumps, get back with the other ace|pg||
nt|athene: Michael Rosenberg has said that when you are in a slam auction you should be trying to play the hand in the bidding|pg||
nt|peachy: So is Dbl...|pg||
nt|othered1: Feels wrong for 1@D, so pass seems clear|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Who says you can't get in later? Look at the CR auction|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Perfect|pg||
nt|athene: yes, west in the other room bid it straight out of the textbook|pg||
nt|othered1: non-space consuming overcalls work better when classic.|pg||
nt|athene: 4@H on a spade lead might be a slight worry?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|athene: often you can see problems - for example if north didn't have BOTH side aces, declarer might be short of an entry for reaching the good spades|pg||
nt|peachy: Ed speaks the truth!|pg||
nt|athene: bidding 1@D meant west actually competed the hand less|pg||
nt|mdgraham: looks like a couple off for a flat board|pg||
nt|othered1: Could be a couple of imps to LMPS here|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|roswolf: wasnt 2@D setting up a gf|pg||
pc|d2|nt|tomi2: seemy both tables will sell the W hand as strong balanced. I think one could open 1@D|pg||
nt|tomi2: both black suits are stopped but the stops dont run away|pg||
pc|d9|nt|tihana: wow|pg||
nt|peachy: wow, North trusted South to actyually have the reverse values|pg||
nt|athene: ok - i apologise for doubting him - he DID show Q10 doubleton!|pg||
nt|athene: well you can't bid much less than 7 after partner reversed|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well done North - influenced by South's reverse, perhaps|pg||
nt|athene: i would have thought it was an underbid if anything|pg||
nt|peachy: exactly, sometimes unconventional bidding pays|pg||
nt|tihana: very different approaches from Grosset and Dombi|pg||
nt|athene: he will probably expect his partner to have that hand but with the @HKQ too so even if the spades can't be used, there will be enough tricks anyway, perhaps with a heart ruff|pg||
nt|peachy: In the other room S did not open, that decision is unusual as well|pg||
nt|athene: yes the diamonds got sort of lost in the other room|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@H goes 1 down but that is still 2 IMPs to the enemy. Not insignificant in an eight-board match|pg||
nt|athene: probably just one down at worst|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mdgraham: well, if you can make a slam in a suit, someone has to bid the suit at some stage|pg||
nt|peachy: His only line is to develop the spades, so he'll just do that and hope|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you won't bid 7@D if all you bid is spades, clubs, and no-trumps |pg||
nt|athene: http://www.pzbs.pl/wyniki/turnieje/2010/pula/team/pulateamleaderb.html  for running scores|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can make with 4-2 spades - he doesn't need 3-3|pg||
nt|mdgraham: in the other room South resonded 1NT to 1@S. As a passed hand, there doesn't seem much wrong with 2@D  |pg||
nt|athene: but if the spades need two ruffs declarer has only three discards and he needs a heart ruff too|pg||
nt|athene: declarer, understandably, is taking his time|pg||
nt|tihana: a mach with two grands already bid.|pg||
nt|athene: you are a bit worried about spade over-ruffs from west|pg||
nt|athene: if you start ruffing spades high you might find you lose a trump trick if they break 4-1|pg||
nt|tihana: @S3 would be nice lead :)|pg||
nt|othered1: I th ink you hold @C losers to 1 by pitching on @S|pg||
nt|athene: you might have to be careful not to run into a trump promotion on three rounds of spades, @HA, fourth spade perhaps|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|petergill: Consus is EW's sponsor - a major company in Poland - Consus is involved in emissions trading schemes or something like that|pg||
nt|rv: if North had min he could have passed 3@c even if 2@d was not setting GF, in my book 4@c should be forcing|pg||
nt|roswolf: or not as the case may be|pg||
pc|d5|nt|marlowepi: N apparently worried that 3rd suit forcing does not set up a GF, or else that his pd wont be sure it does, or else that "GF" auctions can still die at 4m|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Don't understand the small club from Iris|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|roswolf: 3NT IS VERY FORTUNATE|pg||
nt|athene: the defence can't open up the clubs|pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: of course declarer has to find the @HJ anyway even without that, not to mention finding ten tricks :)|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|roswolf: strong with 5 spades apparently|pg||
pc|s3|nt|roswolf: fell short - indeed not as easy as it seems|pg||
nt|petergill: 4NT RKCB should in my opinion be followed by 5NT by South, to let North know that NS has all the keycards and trump queen|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: spade ruff low, @HA, then have a think :)|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps it would have been better to cash the @HA first actually? if you are planning on two spade ruffs and one heart ruff|pg||
nt|athene: you don't ever want to have to overtake a diamond honour from dummy|pg||
nt|athene: or you really are squandering too many big diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: never a wise plan in today's financial climate|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|athene: so maybe @SA, @HA, spade ruff, heart ruff, cash diamond from dummy, spade ruff was better|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dJ|nt|roswolf: 12 top tricks|pg||
pc|cT|nt|Walddk2: It's on a finesse, not that fortunate|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Must finesse spades to make it|pg||
nt|henryb:  needs the @s finesse. and a little luck in a pointed suit: either 3-3 @s or @d coming home|pg||
nt|jbgood: cllose your eyes and open them again after the spade jack wins:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: but lots off if finesse is wrong|pg||
nt|tomi2: in 5@D you lose two aces but can survive without finesses|pg||
nt|athene: you might even endplay west sometimes and make it, on a very good day|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|brolucius: South had the option, presumably, of bidding 5NT after his 4NT. This would tell partner that all the key cards were held and invite him to bid a grand slam. |pg||
nt|peachy: now has to ruff a heart and hope diamonds split|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this line will need 3-2 trumps, as South can't get back to hand after a heart ruff without overtaking, and if he takes a club ruff he can't get back to dummy|pg||
nt|athene: yes, exactly|pg||
nt|athene: i think cashing the @HA at trick 2 was definitely an improvement on this line|pg||
pc|hA|nt|petergill: Then North might bid the grand. |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now I do|pg||
pc|c5|nt|athene: he has no options now does he? he can't ever ruff high here|pg||
pc|h6|nt|roswolf: whereas 5@D is gin|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|rv: slam auctions become too diff, if both North and South both want to have Inv bids after South has shown min |pg||
pc|cA|nt|marlowepi: and over 3N, N was worried that if he bid on terorists would kill his children. only explanation i can think of for not bidding 4C over 3N|pg||
pc|c8|nt|athene: for example cash the spades first, THEN club to queen, then club back and duck it to west|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Matches, particularly short ones, are usually won on partscore swings, not straightforward games|pg||
pc|h3|nt|henryb:  Obviously both 4@h, 4@s and 5@d are all better contracts|pg||
nt|athene: now a small spade from dummy|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|athene: puts south under a bit of pressure re. the @S8|pg||
nt|athene: kibitzers are suggesting that north would not cover without the @S8 but i don't think it's that clearcut|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dK|nt|jbgood: i guess they will bid it -- in the post mortem|pg||
nt|vugraphzqn: small argue befor playing that last one...system problems I think...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Protect your partscore|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: the point is after the opening bid south is marked with most of the points so declarer might perhaps try some sort of chinese finesse|pg||
nt|athene: so north might feel he has to protect against that|pg||
nt|peachy: And South does not know that it actually doesnt matter the way cards lie, but good technique by jerolitsch|pg||
nt|athene: maybe it's all a bit tenuous|pg||
mc|10|nt|petergill: Uncontested auctions like 1@S 1NT Pass or 1@H 1NT 2@C or 1@D 1@H 2@C scream for a trump lead, as a crossruff is quite likely |pg||

mb|p|nt|roswolf: the other room had no problem - a bow and arrow approach 3-5-6|pg||
nt|athene: yes of course, i was just talking about 2@S tick vs 2@H not-quite-tick|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It is often effective|pg||
nt|arno11: quite strong for a 4@S opening bid as chosen in the closed room|pg||
mb|2C|an|!|nt|athene: 2@C from south i guess|pg||
nt|athene: but of course north won't be interested in anything higher than 2@H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.pzbs.pl/wyniki/turnieje/2010/pula/team/pulateam2leaderb.html  for running scores|pg||
nt|othered1: is east thinking of (garbage) STayman?|pg||
nt|athene: but you don't expect all this (and @HQ too) with west opening a weak-2@S|pg||
nt|peachy: took th bull by the horns|pg||
nt|athene: one area of the game that most partnerships don't discuss nearly enough (i.e. at all) is advancing a 3nt overcall|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not at all clear if south should show his suit|pg||
nt|peachy: true, however general principles could apply. Systems on whenever they can be|pg||
nt|athene: usually problems occur after a 3-level pre-empt when a 3NT overcall can be really wide-ranging|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzqn: i think he was...:)|pg||
nt|athene: you aren't weak enough to be bidding it out of fear|pg||
nt|mdgraham: why should he?|pg||
nt|arno11: 1@S might have been 4 cards and a longer suit that´s why the alert|pg||
mb|4S|nt|mdgraham: 2@C=good raise to 2@H|pg||
nt|athene: and you aren't strong enough to have game interest|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now you can set up your 7th trick in hearts|pg||
nt|athene: so i think 1NT passed is the goldilocks call - just right|pg||
nt|Walddk2: win king and play another one|pg||
nt|mdgraham: an ace and a king don't usually add up to enough for game opposite a strong NT|pg||
nt|othered1: must north capitulate honors with south?|pg||
nt|peachy: including here|pg||
nt|arno11: true, 3N cld easily be based on a running minor and be much better than 4@H..|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: it is not a question of "cancelling" a GF. there is a case for allowing "strong" auctions to die at 4m, because not every hand that wants to play 3N if a certain suit is stopped ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: would be thriolled to contract for 11 tricks if it isnt|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so (usually) 2@H is the weakest bid North can make|pg||
nt|athene: east has a lot to say - he has a 1nt bid, a negative double and a club raise|pg||
nt|peachy: I like Dbl|pg||
nt|athene: but clubs are raised even less often than diamonds these days of course|pg||
nt|petergill: I too would open 1@S, unless I was playing the Namyats convention. Much too strong for 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Ignore that|pg||
nt|fabsayc: good bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: East is one of the world's greatest players. His website is http://www.martensuniversity.com/. |pg||
nt|brolucius: North's 2@H means that he want to go no higher (understandably) if South's major is hearts.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Suitable for a Namyats, is it not?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|rv: it essentially means you are cancelling GF:)|pg||
nt|athene: north's hand gets a lot better when partner has a long suit|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and a practical one|pg||
nt|peachy: Took the bull by the horns, twice in this auction:)|pg||
nt|athene: north can pretty much play the hand in the bidding|pg||
nt|arno11: bidding 4@S vs. the strong NT was worth a game swing on bd 23|pg||
nt|athene: draw trumps whilst ruffing the diamonds good|pg||
nt|athene: loads of entries to his hand (having a 25 count has that effect)|pg||
nt|peachy: heh, Bill :)|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|arno11: development not unlucky for NS, but still well done|pg||
pc|dK|nt|xenya: here, too, trump lead was best -- but hard to find |pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.bridgeguys.com/Conventions/Namyats.html|pg||
pc|d3|nt|petergill: Martens' books and training are highly recommended - some of his books have been translated into English|pg||
nt|brolucius: South doubles 3@H to tell partner that this is his suit. If he omitted to do this, North might on some auctions bid high in spades, assuming that South held spades.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: a question of wording i guess. you could call it a "conditional game force" too|pg||
nt|roswolf: west probably converted a plus into a minus by bidding 4@H|pg||
pc|d5|nt|peachy: difficult to pass 2H, their last chance for a plus|pg||
pc|d6|nt|athene: 2@H would be interesting but i guess it might go one down|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|Walddk2: There is no 7th trick when the spade finesse is off|pg||
nt|athene: small spade from hand is a possible play|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: try to set up the long spade|pg||
nt|arno11: @D ducked better as in CR|pg||
pc|sA|nt|brolucius: It seems to me that East's 3@H was a bit risky, since it might have been read as natural (with South's suit not yet known). But West held hearts and did not raise so they clearly ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: knew what they were doing.|pg||
nt|petergill: At least 1100 looks achievable if East can double 2@H for take-out and West converts to penalty|pg||
nt|jbgood: perhaps it would have paid off to double 2 hearts? |pg||
nt|jbgood: unlucky lead|pg||
nt|athene: would be touch and go between one down and making|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sT|pg||
nt|petergill: When you have the boss suit, with opponents not vul (less likely to save at 5 level), there is less need to preempt them out of the auction - so opening 1@S (in case 6@S is on) ...|pg||
nt|petergill: makes sense |pg||
pc|d4|pc|d7|nt|brolucius: Perhaps that would have shown hearts?|pg||
nt|petergill: At both tables, the vulnerable penalty was not taken|pg||
nt|peachy: this was not an easy hand for East|pg||
nt|athene: it doesn't help to cash the diamonds throwing the hearts away - south can ruff and still make a trump trick|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Try to read Namyats backwards|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|vugraphzqn: ...REALLY TOO FAST...SRY|pg||
nt|othered1: In the CR, looks like east essentially did treat the hand as "garbage" Stayman.|pg||
nt|peachy: good discard|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|jbgood: even clearer to double by E in the other room...|pg||
nt|petergill: I think 2HX is only 1100 - trump promotion for 1400 is not available, I think|pg||
nt|athene: the alternative way to play this sort of 1NT contract is to lead clubs|pg||
nt|athene: that can have two benefits|pg||
nt|athene: firstly it might cause the defence to attack other suits you want them to|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Walddk2: It is no coincidence|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|s3|nt|athene: but even if they don't do that it can tighten up the position for endplays without losing too many tricks|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|sK|nt|arno11: but there S played @D instead of trump, but I guess all roads will lead to success|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|roswolf: 1100 is never bad|pg||
pc|c5|pc|s5|pg||
nt|rv: West 's hand is tempting to pass 3n, I generally like to pass with 4333 and min hand|pg||
pc|h8|nt|athene: 6@H was not a wild bid at all - as can be judged from the fact that south couldn't really have any less and this is making an overtrick|pg||
pc|h6|nt|henryb:  unluckier shift|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h2|pg||

nt|roswolf: very restained by west|pg||
nt|athene: if the defence had started spade to the ace, spade ruff, east would have had a horrible dilemma|pg||
nt|athene: you might lead small from the ace and if east plays low, put in the ten, and if that loses to the jack, run the queen, on the basis that east wouldn't duck with @SKx|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You can't look at the spade suit in isolation, Bill|pg||
nt|othered1: But the possiblilites are limited by other considerations on the actual hands.|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: @CA, @HAK to pitch the club, then play diamonds|pg||
nt|Walddk2: certainly|pg||
nt|petergill: I think Kelsey's books on bridge odds (co-written with Glauert) and squeezes (much easier to read than Clyde Love's book) and ultra-expert card play book (with Ottlik) are all ...|pg||
nt|petergill: great, and his classics Killing Defence and More Killing Defence are OK too|pg||
nt|petergill: At least @H's are 3-3, unlike spades|pg||
nt|petergill: and @H10 to ruff a spade might be an entry to the clubs - I wonder if he can make this - would require fine play |pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphpl2: zadumal sie i mruczy cos pod nosem:)|pg||
nt|athene: with the stakes at 4@HXX :)|pg||
nt|athene: this should be a nice simple auction - maybe west will ask for the @CK|pg||
nt|arno11: :)|pg||
nt|athene: but if west just didn't know what to do, that suggests he needs to discuss defence to polish 1@C |pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: a very cautious comment ...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that would be good, and is a useful meaning of 5N in this kind of auction |pg||
nt|athene: but really how can he not have that?|pg||
nt|athene: one thing about polish club is that people playing it open 1@C a LOT|pg||
nt|petergill: @D7 or @SQ lead?|pg||
pc|d7|nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|vugraphzqn: w question S about that 2@s...|pg||
nt|vugraphzqn: strong with supp|pg||
nt|athene: but if you go for some sort of crossruff you might run into too many overruffs in hearts perhaps|pg||
nt|athene: so you really need to know what you are doing over it|pg||
nt|arno11: interesting contract but 2 will be easy|pg||
nt|peachy: was 1D a transfer, or some point count range?|pg||
nt|athene: 1@D negative|pg||
nt|athene: or might be some strong hands but usually negative|pg||
nt|peachy: ty, I am not that familiar with Polish Club|pg||
nt|athene: if they are playing normal Polish|pg||
nt|petergill: Leading the Beer Card (@D7) = same choice as me |pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|nt|othered1: which is what declarer in CR did, but he played @SA before ruffing @D and things came apart from there|pg||

nt|arno11: low @D ?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: yes, cashing the @SA is certainly mad|pg||
nt|athene: well perhaps not mad, but sub-optimal let's say |pg||
nt|Walddk2: diamond ducked now|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mdgraham: plus there may be an element of if-you-can-bid-a-grand then so-can-we|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Playing Gazzilli is much better than jumping to 3@H|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|athene: west can count 12 tricks|pg||
pc|d5|nt|athene: doesn't bid 7nt because you might need to ruff the clubs good, or ruff a spade in the east hand, for the thirteenth trick|pg||
nt|mdgraham: good flat board|pg||

pc|sA|nt|athene: not an easy contract|pg||
pc|s8|pc|s6|pc|s2|pg||
nt|jbgood: will he find the single club ace for the overtrick?|pg||
nt|athene: hard to keep trump control to use the diamonds|pg||
pc|sK|nt|petergill: Dominik Filipowicz is much younger than Martens|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2@H showed a minimum hand (in response to the take-out double), so the 4@C splinter bid was pushing it a bit. Could have been a slam there, I suppose.|pg||
nt|athene: but you have too big a diamond fit to go for a crossruff comfortably|pg||
pc|sT|nt|petergill: I agree about the "pushing it a bit"|pg||
nt|othered1: you do have pretty good trump pips.  Losing both high @S on overruffs, plus the @S7 would be cruel.|pg||
nt|peachy: I have had lots of help from kibitzers, re 1D response : (0-7 any or 12-15 without major 4 ,possible 7-9 on minor without good bid|pg||
pc|s9|nt|petergill: If he ruffs a spade low = no good. If ruff with @H10 then East will pitch a club|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|roswolf: doubt it|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sJ|nt|athene: once you know west can't overruff diamonds you should be OK |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Then you can use 3@H as weakish with 5-5|pg||
pc|hT|pc|c8|pg||
nt|jbgood: yes!|pg||
nt|petergill: I think @H10 is best play - well done|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c5|pc|d2|nt|othered1: now if east overruffs, he can't pull trumps|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Thanks Tomislav, great operating!|pg||
nt|vugraphzqn: last board of this match...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: slammish|pg||
nt|athene: a good lesson from that hand - many people feel it's safer to cash just one round of trumps, but that can often allow a defender to draw a killing second (or third) round later on|pg||
nt|petergill: Jerolitsch photo http://worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=13996|pg||
mb|1S|an|!|nt|athene: drawing just one round of trumps rarely stops a damaging ruff since it's unlikely a defender has ruffing potential and a singleton trump|pg||
nt|arno11: 6@C a make here with trumps 3-2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 40% slam 6@C is, so below par|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: At least his singleton was in the suit that had been overcalled, which suggested that partner's values would be in the other three suits - just where they were needed.|pg||
nt|rv: thx Tomislav, continue the great job|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Anyone for 4@C now?|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt possible from west now|pg||
nt|othered1: Penalty doubles anyone?|pg||
nt|peachy: Not sure if anyone plays Dbl there is penalty|pg||
mb|3C|nt|vugraphpl2: gajcyk chcial grac 2@d z X|pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks a push in 4@H|pg||
nt|petergill: Consus Oil's sponsorship of bridge is thanks to Piotr Wasiak, I think |pg||
nt|rv: this is weak bal nt version of Polish @c|pg||
nt|athene: of course east might have had @SAxxx @HAQxx @DQxx @CAK :) but in that case it's just not your day|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They do not exist below 7@H, Ed|pg||
nt|othered1: Some of us do.|pg||
nt|athene: if west does bid 3nt, east's excitement will be lessened, as he knows there are wasted club cards opposite|pg||
nt|athene: if west had shown a good spade raise, east would not have stopped below about lotsof@S|pg||
nt|peachy: for those interested in the beer http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_card|pg||
nt|arno11: also 6NT on the lucky lie of the @D suit...|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: North might consider a slam opposite a 2NT opening, but not opposite a strong 1NT.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mdgraham: you might open 1@H with that, not 1@C|pg||
nt|mdgraham: unless 5cM, of course|pg||
nt|fabsayc: south could have treated his hand by opening 1c and jumping in spades|pg||
nt|fabsayc: perhaps a little shy in sure tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzqn: thx Martin, Arno, Raija and Walter...thx Roland and kibbs...:)|pg||
nt|athene: is 3@C invitational? seems a bit strong if so|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: 13-15 bal|pg||
nt|peachy: I like 3NT, even with spade support|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: polish standards for 2 over 1 overcalls are quiet low, I would pass that hand. qtz73 cries for trapping pass and reopening double|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3nt is a fair shot here|pg||
nt|othered1: But why was it alerted?|pg||
nt|athene: yes, 4333 is notrump shape|pg||
nt|athene: we know that east feels that way - on board 9 he chose 3nt with 4333 when his partner had five spades|pg||
nt|athene: so it's good to see the partnership is in tune :)|pg||
nt|othered1: Looks like 6@S making 5, 3N making 6.  Odd.|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: hmmm - i was expecting south to say he had a minimum, which isn't usually 3nt|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5@C is better than 3NT|pg||
nt|petergill: and last but not least Ben H-P photo is at http://worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=3464|pg||
nt|vugraphzqn: ...last board of this match...thx comentator and kibbss....|pg||
nt|arno11: over 3@C E has a difficult rebid, as eg 3@D wld show 5 @D 4@S  |pg||
pc|d4|nt|petergill: Heading for a flat board here|pg||
nt|peachy: depends on what 2NT asked|pg||
nt|mdgraham: maybe by the NS standards that isn't a minimum - in which case, I'd like to see one|pg||
nt|fabsayc: either way this is an absolute maximum 1@S opener in polish club|pg||
nt|peachy: Thank you TOmislav, great job as operator, much appreciated|pg||
nt|arno11: making 5 for a flat board|pg||
nt|vugraphzqn: and William ofcourse...:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Sometimes you go down in 3NT when 5@C is cold, never the other way around|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|roswolf: e/w in the other room did well to find 5@C|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i am guessing RD by S would show a better hand|pg||
nt|athene: that's really a pretty bad hand for a second-seat weak 2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it's that extra club trick|pg||
nt|arno11: thx everyone, nice close match|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d3|pg||
nt|petergill: Consus just scored another big swing|pg||
nt|rv: I would have bid 1@h with North or XX from South as SOS instead of 1@d|pg||
nt|peachy: Especially, thank you specs for your comments and tips|pg||
nt|vugraphzqn: see you in 15 mins....|pg||
pc|cA|nt|vugraphpl2: odpytuja sie z systemu|pg||
nt|tomi2: and if we make game, i pass and west will pass to, partner will reopen with double or 1nt. if he cant reopen we are favortes to have no game on|pg||
nt|tihana: 3N is a beuty |pg||
pc|c7|nt|jbgood: it doesnt always work that way, Thomas, so I must admit I would bid 2@h|pg||
pc|c3|nt|rv: yes maybe XX by South shows a strong variety of Polish @c|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mdgraham: and smile....|pg||
nt|tihana: buc|pg||
nt|athene: it's certainly getting more beautiful by the minute|pg||
nt|othered1: Really the lead consideration, and that emphasizes the benefit of 3N, not to mention thatnorth may be ready to ruff @C|pg||
nt|athene: north will no doubt be happy to find his "costly" lead didn't cost at all|pg||
nt|athene: he just lost the same 12 imps either way :)|pg||
pc|c9|nt|marlowepi: 2C by E seems excessively modest|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|cT|nt|jbgood: fortunately bridge players have different approaches - else it would be a dull game|pg||
nt|athene: declarer might not know the diamond position so he will want to ruff the clubs down for a diamond pitch|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thanks Tomislav|pg||

pc|d5|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Walddk2: and thanks Peter, Vladimir and Arno|pg||
nt|arno11: shld enter hand with a @H and play @C ducking if the Q appears|pg||
nt|petergill: !@HQ to ace then low club ducking if South produces bare queen is a safety play in case North has @CJxx and South has five diamonds to ace|pg||
mc|12|nt|rv: I prefer 1@d O/C by West and bid later instead of X|pg||
