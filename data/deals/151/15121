mb|p|mb|3D|nt|larrymori: I do not understand the give up on the majors when pard's overcall might have a 4 card major on the side especially when south  denied one|pg||
nt|xenya: wouldn't 2@C be enough for a raise?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|haans: thety play MP so M important|pg||
nt|larrymori: it is a way to differentiate 3 and 4 card raises, many now play the jump cue as a mixed raise|pg||
mb|p|pc|c7|nt|haans: it will end with all raised being mixed|pg||
nt|haans: either i have it or i dont :)|pg||

nt|haans: East dummy|pg||
nt|yuval10: then give S another 4 @c's so trumps are 2-2|pg||

pc|hQ|pc|hJ|pc|h4|pc|h9|pg||
nt|yuval10: that wasn't a good start....|pg||

nt|larrymori: but will have to guess whether 3253 or this distribution|pg||
nt|yuval10: so N has 6 @c's ?|pg||
nt|yuval10: had A@h?|pg||

nt|Walddk2: This is a marathon day for the participants. First 12 boards of IMP Pairs, then 54 boards of Indy (22 is the last board). Very demanding|pg||
nt|haans: Lebesohl only for responder i say|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Tomorrow 54 boards of BAM|pg||

nt|yuval10: W is currently 4th place in this tournement, probably 1st overall, considering the fact that he won 2nd place in the pairs event yesterday|pg||

mb|p|mb|1C|nt|yuval10: great matchup to end a very busy day|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2H|nt|chick: this looks like a monster EW, but there is no slam|pg||

nt|vugraphzrn: Altshuler*|pg||

pc|d6|pc|h6|pg||
pc|hT|pc|c3|pc|dT|nt|yuval10: perhaps he was caught into the light overcall and thought there's no way S doesn't have the A@c ?|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
pc|h8|pc|c6|nt|chick: must be something like that|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s2|pg||
nt|chick: maybe he saw an "only chance" play that way|pg||
nt|yuval10: but he should've known that there was no way that S would'ne have played the A@c at first round, it's a certainty that declarer has either a singel  or more likely a void in @c ...|pg||
nt|yuval10: from the play|pg||
nt|vugraphzrn: Pachtman take his @Cs cards and put them aside|pg||
nt|yuval10: lol|pg||
nt|yuval10: good way to prevent mistakes|pg||
nt|chick: hahahaaaa|pg||
nt|yuval10: probably a good tip for all you out there - when you're affraid to play a suit by mistake - just take it off your cards|pg||
pc|s9|nt|vugraphzrn: Zack claimed in defence|pg||
nt|yuval10: 2 tricks for the def. either way|pg||
