nt|xenya: or 9?|pg||
nt|vugraphzda: 11 claimed, perhaps I got a card wrong in the play|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: looked like 11 to me|pg||
nt|blum1956: Jason worked out that the @dQ is with S so he is alredy void in hearts|pg||
nt|brolucius: Diamond lead would have sunk 4@H.|pg||
mb|1N|an|14-16|nt|athene: he took @SQ, six clubs, @DAK and the heart finesse|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Segment 1 scores: Teltscher 86 Hackett 29, Senior 13 Rosen 49, Hinden 35 Small 41, Crouch 40 de Botton 52|pg||
mb|2D|an|!S and other|nt|vugraphzda: Justin asks if 4@Ss are possible in the 2@D overcall|pg||
nt|athene: A good hand here perhaps for transfers after 1NT - intervention.|pg||
nt|vugraphzda: Answer = yes|pg||
mb|4H|nt|brolucius: No reason for Justin to want to play the contract. He probably has a transfer mechanism. Oh, he doesn't.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Diamond lead impossible to find...|pg||
pc|s7|nt|athene: I think this is one area of bidding where a bit of science is definitely beneficial.|pg||
nt|athene: You often gain a trick or two by putting the overcaller on lead playing up to the strong notrump.|pg||
nt|vugraphzda: Justin asks about leads, told 3/5th|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sA|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|athene: Even if you just play that jumps to 4@D/4@H are texas for the major, that is better than nothing.|pg||
nt|blum1956: the club return looks clear but North must distinguish that from the singleton club|pg||
nt|brolucius: Most people return a singleton immediately.... (there have been several appeals on that basis in the USA).|pg||
nt|blum1956: No appeals when they return a NONsingle club NOT immediately?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Both sorts.|pg||
nt|athene: Yes, unauthorized information from tempo in defence happens all the time; it's a much bigger problem than many people realise.|pg||
nt|athene: People think UI just means partner doing (whatever) in the auction after you took two minutes to pass, but there are lots of very tricky areas in defence.|pg||
nt|brolucius: North knows that his partner has at most one trump, so no reason to suspect that a side-suit return is a singleton.|pg||
nt|athene: Yes, you assume 4@H is a six-card suit.|pg||
pc|s8|nt|blum1956: this time thejob looks easy as South must cash the @dA before playing the singleton club|pg||

nt|blum1956: hi all|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|an|(14)15-17|nt|brolucius: That seemed perfectly reasonable defence from South, to me. It was more likely that the lead was a singleton than that North would hold the @CA when West had bid game.|pg||

nt|athene: ok|pg||
nt|athene: he should have cashed the @DQ first then he would have changed his mind i suspect|pg||
nt|brolucius: This is a standard situation for a Smith Peter by East. His jack might be from Q-J-x in which case he would indicate 'strong holding in your suit, partner' with a Smith Peter.|pg||
nt|brolucius: That is why South should win with his higher honor, to hide the position of the Q.|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|pc|s9|pc|s6|pg||

mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|athene: East might emerge with a takeout double of 2@S|pg||
nt|brolucius: South's removal of the double indicates a duff opening in 3rd seat.|pg||
mb|2S|mb|d|an|t/o|mb|p|mb|3D|nt|athene: now west has various options, partly dictated by their agreements over 2NT in this position|pg||
nt|blum1956: The brothers' methods  will certainly allow them to land in 3@d|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D suggests they play lebensohl|pg||
nt|brolucius: Bill had made a second accurate prediction! He should be a professional gambler, rather than a mere BBO commentator.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: so 3@D is showing a good hand|pg||
mb|p|pc|c4|nt|athene: if they were playing scrambling 2nt then of course west would have bid that instead|pg||
nt|athene: i think scramble is more useful, certainly when one hand is fairly limited (like a 1nt bid), and should be your default agreement|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, but South had already bid the black suits.|pg||
nt|athene: ah yes, there is that i guess|pg||
nt|athene: If you did bid a scrambling 2NT over the double, partner might assume it had to be 4-4 in the reds, since south bid clubs, and he might bid a disastrous 3@H|pg||
nt|athene: OK the other room sort of explored all these issues :)|pg||
nt|athene: Unfortunate in the other room that South never got to reveal his very light opener, as Whittaker did here (2@C)|pg||
nt|blum1956: probably the 2NT itself was the best spot. Maybe even makeable.|pg||
nt|athene: I mean unfortunate for NS in the other room.|pg||
nt|athene: Although I think McIntosh was totally mad to pass the double after his partner bid 2@S over 1NT.|pg||
nt|athene: You just pull that every day of the week, on planet earth, don't you?|pg||
nt|vugraphzda: Anyone seen what happed at Goodison Park just now!|pg||

nt|Walddk2: If Crouch reads this, North can be endplayed to lead away from @HK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That is why a heart switch was needed at trick 2|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes cash out the side suits|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But he has to guess North's shape|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2 hearts and 3 clubs, or the other way round|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He is certain re diamonds|pg||
pc|c7|nt|yo_yo: 12 imps|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Or a diamond to confirm the layout|pg||
nt|roswolf: north will be endplayed twice|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Then it is also easy|pg||
nt|othered1: And east's double of 2@S had to be on more than just the @HA|pg||
nt|roswolf: in either red suit - declarer's choice|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Looking like someone who had  xx|pg||

mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphzda: Understandably doesn't want to look at the scores any more i guess|pg||
nt|athene: One thing you notice watching the very top players (Helgemo, the top italians) is that they are very, very wary about doubling 2major or 3minor.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Most pairs use conventional rebids opposite a 1NT response nowadays. Brogeland treats 2NT as game-forcing.|pg||
nt|blum1956: There are communication problems|pg||
pc|s3|nt|athene: Yes there was a book on Helgemo came out quite a while ago ("Bridge with Imagination" i think) where they described this idea.|pg||
nt|brolucius: A spade lead was better than a diamond because East had denied four spades.|pg||
nt|vugraphzda: Mike Amos (the director) has just dropped a pile of boards next to the table; quickly picks them up|pg||
nt|athene: Helgemo is mainly a natural bidder, so this was interesting because it was one of the few bits of system he played.|pg||
nt|athene: the idea is 1major - 1nt; 2nt is a stronger hand than a 1nt opener so you might as well make it game-forcing|pg||
nt|blum1956: 3NT looks not that safe|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, usually 18-19 for 2NT.|pg||
nt|vugraphzda: Jason is studying NS's convention card|pg||
nt|vugraphzda: Asks for the flap to be replaced|pg||
nt|athene: if you want four clubs, you might overtake the queen|pg||
nt|vugraphzda: this is the other side of the screen to me|pg||
nt|vugraphzda: so I don't know what's being asked, presumably about their leads|pg||
nt|athene: that will bring the suit in for one loser on 3-3 break or the @CJ or @C10 falling doubleton|pg||
nt|brolucius: As the cards lie, he can win, cash the @CA-Q and duck a heart. But that is not likely to be best at single-dummy.|pg||
nt|xenya: must play for 4-3 @S and 3-3 in @H or @C i think|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sQ|pc|s6|pg||
nt|blum1956: the declarer may duck twice then cash two top clubs and play a small heart but this is not that clear|pg||

pc|c4|pc|c2|pc|c3|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c5|pc|c7|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|athene: declarer's problem now is, he doesn't know if clubs are actually breaking|pg||
nt|athene: it would be a pity to duck a heart and find the defence can cash too many spades, with clubs 3-3 all the time|pg||
nt|athene: but there just isn't any way to find out|pg||
nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
nt|brolucius: Restricted Choice applies to South's club honour, it seems.|pg||
nt|blum1956: that is why it probably were better to duck spades and discover their distribution|pg||
nt|brolucius: But I suppose he might play it from @CJ-x-x.|pg||
nt|athene: Yes, Restricted Choice is lurking around in the background as it usually does.|pg||
nt|vugraphzda: Jason picks up convention card again|pg||
nt|athene: if declarer had held up in spades he would have known the break|pg||
nt|brolucius: If declarer ducks a spade, he might be worried about a diamond switch and a return to spades.|pg||
nt|vugraphzda: Now a sip of water, and ruffles his unplayed cards|pg||
nt|brolucius: At the other table West played 3NT. He won @SQ opening lead, cashed @CA-Q and ducked a heart. |pg||
nt|blum1956: yes such danger does exist but it brings a diamond trick to declarer instead of the heart one and he may then try for 4 hearts|pg||
nt|brolucius: Many thanks to Ant Edwards for the excellent table-side details!|pg||
nt|athene: Also, it is quite a tough defence to find, even if it was actually killing.|pg||

mb|p|pc|hT|pc|hQ|pc|h4|nt|athene: East sensibly leads a heart.  Many players, having read too many books or listened to too many teachers, think it's a moral imperative to lead partner's suit.|pg||

nt|vugraphzda: Again, the questions are on the other side of the screen alas|pg||
nt|brolucius: 'Moral imperative' is not a phrase that you see in many bridge books.|pg||
nt|athene: In fact, if in doubt, never lead partner's suit :)  Certainly in this situation a heart is far more likely to be right.|pg||
nt|brolucius: West's @H4 is likely to be a count signal, but some would play attitude (in which case the @H4 might be a reverse-attitude signal to show the @HJ.)|pg||

nt|vugraphzda: Speed of play I think|pg||
nt|athene: OK - so East plays this double as penalties, but has he shared the good news with his brother?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Most pairs use the Rule of 470 and 670 in such positions.|pg||
nt|blum1956: 2@h South is not that bad|pg||
nt|athene: I find it hard to believe Justin actually doesn't know what the double means; he must just be wondering whether to pull it even given that it is penalty.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Hardly in a position to pull it, really.|pg||
nt|athene: If so, he should pull to 2@S, I think - that has to show a weak hand with only five spades and short hearts (hence a long minor)|pg||
nt|athene: So if east hates spades he can get out in 3minor|pg||
nt|blum1956: certainly jason will pass 2@s if Justin bids that|pg||
nt|athene: A kibitzer suggests it might be an "either-or" double but I doubt the Hacketts play anything as  weird as that.|pg||
nt|brolucius: The 'Rule of 470 and 670' means that you should not try a risk double (that may be misinterpreted) if the likely loss is more than that number. Jason's hand was borderline in this ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: respect.|pg||
nt|vugraphzda: Justin's thinking pose is not dissimilar to "the thinker", but clothed of course|pg||
nt|athene: For anyone who hasn't met this sort of double, the idea is you double with either a marked t/o shape (singleton or void) OR a marked penalty (5-card trump stack upwards)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|athene: these two sorts of hand are so dissimilar, the theory goes, your partner will know for sure which one you have|pg||

nt|brolucius: 'Ability to Waffle' counts for a full 40% in the exam for BBO commentators. |pg||

mb|p|nt|yo_yo: when do you double and when do you compete|pg||
nt|ady: west likely to pass|pg||
nt|garnetts: I would rather be in 6@D than 2@D |pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: i suppose if East double he fears West will lead @S|pg||
nt|blum1956: 5@d looks the best spot. Even 6@d makeable. But East was most unhappy with his overcall. Certainly he was going to rebid|pg||
nt|garnetts: I suppose that West couldn't bid 2@D because it was conventional--personally I would bid 3@D then |pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: decent 3NT for EW here|pg||
nt|sybarra: feisty all the was to 2 @C |pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dA|pc|d7|pc|d2|pg||

nt|brolucius: The Hacketts have so far picked up 16 plus scores out of 18. The two minus scores cost them 24 IMPs, however.|pg||
nt|athene: They wouldn't object to opening that shape 1nt when in range|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1S|nt|athene: I bet if he had the same hand without the @DJ he would have opened 1NT|pg||
mb|1N|mb|2S|mb|d|an|t/o|mb|p|nt|blum1956: There are two gaps - 2245 and a small heart doubleton|pg||
nt|athene: well 4-2-1-6 and a small singleton didn't stop him a moment ago :)|pg||
nt|athene: of course some people are more likely to want to bend a 1nt overcall than an opener|pg||
nt|blum1956: That time he had a fair stopper in the opponent's suit|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dQ|nt|athene: N-S seem to have dodged their 4-4 heart fit|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps South felt that north would bid a major first time if he had one|pg||
nt|vugraphzda: Liggins: "sorry if that's ot enough"|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d5|pc|d3|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|athene: and hence 1@D then t/o double was more likely 2-3-5-3 or so|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|pc|h7|pg||
nt|brolucius: 1NT was a bit borderline on the South cards, too. |pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|pc|hQ|pc|h6|pg||
nt|athene: several kibitzers are asking why south should double then bid 1nt rather than just bidding 1nt first time|pg||
pc|dT|nt|athene: he is too strong for a balancing 1nt - that would be about 11-15 or so|pg||
nt|brolucius: Bidding after protection is still an under-discussed area of the game. It is not enough to say 'We play the 'subtracted king' method'. That still leads to problems.|pg||
nt|blum1956: maybe Liggins should better have responded 1@h rather than 1@d? Anyway his double showes he had estimated his hand as a good one|pg||
nt|athene: didn't mike lawrence write a whole weighty tome on protective bidding? of course he probably called it "balancing" so no-one in england had a clue what he was talking about|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d2|pc|d6|pg||
nt|athene: they thought it was a book on tightrope walking and moved on|pg||
nt|vugraphzda: @C4 being considered|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c9|pc|cT|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|hA|nt|brolucius: Even though a protective double may be lighter than normal, I still think that responder should not overload the simple suit response. He should be willing to give a single jump ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: quite freely.|pg||
pc|d7|pc|h9|pc|hK|pg||
pc|h8|pc|c5|pc|hT|pc|s3|pg||
pc|d8|nt|brolucius: It is a good bridge tip to not over-balance.|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s9|pc|dA|pg||
nt|athene: Well, i think jumping in a suit in response to a 4th seat double of 1@C is another interesting issue because you can't have a decent 5-card suit with some points or you would have ...|pg||
nt|athene: overcalled|pg||
pc|sK|nt|athene: so you pretty much have to have a weak notrump with a 4-card suit|pg||

nt|Walddk2: One thought 3@S was forcing, the other one did not|pg||
nt|garnetts: One thinks 3@S is forcing and the other doesn't |pg||
nt|garnetts: Bidding 2@S gives information about not leading a spade--which I would be keen not to do--2NT doesn't preclude a heart contract |pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes  agree|pg||
nt|garnetts: 2NT gets a spade lead and bidding 2@S gets a lead you don't like |pg||

nt|garnetts: on the last hand the auction in the OR room was odd to say the least--East was unbelievably conservative |pg||

nt|garnetts: West overcalled 1@C with 1@D and west just bid hearts twice |pg||
pc|d3|pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|garnetts: Dixon and Silverstone have for years thought three of amjor was a pointless contrcat and simply agreed that it was always forcing |pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@S is the default rebid with an unbalanced minimum hand without 3 hearts, so it did not guarantee six cards|pg||

nt|athene: as a kibitzer remarks, you shouldn't lead a fast club singleton here|pg||
nt|athene: and a  slow club doubleton|pg||
nt|athene: well, it will probably give you good results|pg||
nt|brolucius: We had that situation before in this session.|pg||

nt|brolucius: As you sit among the silverware.|pg||
nt|vugraphzda: 2NT=natural|pg||
nt|blum1956: This is wellknown in theory. The immediate club swith is a doubleton as South must wait for the @sA with a singleton|pg||

nt|othered1: That 1N overcall(as opposed to an opening) wouldn't be everyone's cup of tea.  West's great @Slength, however, is a great catch.|pg||
nt|roswolf: a case for 3@S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4 can go down but it may not|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h4|nt|garnetts: I think no decision here--must be right to pass--might have been tempted on the South hand except that partner has passed already |pg||

nt|athene: That East hand is at least three tricks too good for 2@H|pg||

nt|vugraphzda: I am sitting on the West/South side of the table, so either North or East could be thinking here|pg||
nt|athene: West might have considered 4NT as a general takeout bid over 4@S, with such an offensive hand|pg||
nt|brolucius: Let's hope so.|pg||
mb|p|mb|5H|mb|d|mb|p|nt|athene: Good news and bad news - he gets his club ruff but it only holds the contract to 11 tricks.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|cJ|nt|brolucius: East's 5@H may look amazing but he know that his partner is likely to hold at most 1@S, so he must have general values. (And 1@H might have been on only four cards).|pg||

nt|xenya: this, of course, is better than 4@SX, although the latter might go down 2 |pg||
mb|2D!|an|multi|nt|brolucius: West might have bid differently over 4@S if playing five-card majors.|pg||
nt|athene: Whether West bids right away depends on his defence; he has a takeout double of hearts, and some defences to a multi allow you to show that right away.|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|brolucius: You can play either Pass or Redouble to ask partner to show his suit.|pg||
nt|blum1956: South should better have discarded a diamond on the club return by West|pg||
