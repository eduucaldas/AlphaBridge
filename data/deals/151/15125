nt|yuval10: good morning|pg||
nt|mich-b: interesting board here .. 4@H for EW , but cheap save in 5@D available for NS|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 4 hearts better than 4 spades here|pg||
nt|yuval10: basically we have 2 players competing for 1st place overall this tournement - Gilad Altshuller and Dror Padon|pg||
mb|1D|mb|2S|mb|3D|mb|4H|nt|mich-b: I think the format of the event created an undesirable situation :|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|yuval10: Birman ( 3rd ) is playing with Altshuler in the team, therefor can't move past him|pg||
mb|d|nt|mich-b: some players can not win the event , since their teammates have done better in the individual|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h4|nt|mich-b: This means that perhaps the individual has to be the last event of the 3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.israbridge.com/home/results/2010/gp2010/grand2010-english  for overall standings among the 28 players|pg||
nt|yuval10: and Israel Yadlin ( 4th ) is playing with Padon ( 2nd ) and can't move past him either|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Agree there, Michael|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pc|h5|pg||
nt|flash: morning all; we don't see a lot of this form of scoring any more|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Indy must come last for all three events to be interesting|pg||
nt|flash: on this side of the pond, we call it Board-A-Match (BAM)|pg||
nt|flash: closer to Israel, it's called Point-A-Board|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: i played a similar format once and happily we split the money between us, ignoring the individual result|pg||
nt|flash: it's bascially super-matchpoints...   there are 3 scores available:  a top, a bottom and an average|pg||
nt|mich-b: Meanwhile , well judged by both sides here , reaching the par contract 5@DX|pg||
nt|flash: any difference, even the 10-point difference between NT and a major suit, is enough to decide the board|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c9|pc|cQ|pc|c2|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|pc|s8|pc|s3|pg||
nt|mich-b: Good play by Gilboa cashing the @SA|pg||
nt|flash: at its best, this takes an extremely conservative approach to the game|pg||
nt|mich-b: there is time to play a @C after cashing the @SA if needed|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|pc|c7|mc|10|nt|yuval10: this tournement is not only unique in its format, it's also marked the first time a tournement in that caliber is played while using Bridgemates|pg||
nt|yuval10: I think we should all praise Doron Yadlin for that|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 54 boards altogether, divided into three sessions of 18 boards. 3 boards against each opponent|pg||
nt|flash: a prime reason for its increasing rarity is that the strongest team(s) usually come out on top|pg||
nt|mich-b: Agree , unfortunately|pg||
nt|flash: over here, it's been almost totally replaced by short-match, Swiss-style team games|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But the teams are pretty random regarding skill level as Michael explained earlier|pg||
nt|mich-b: There have been several trends in events organizing , which went to wards randomizing results|pg||
nt|flash: pls mark your calendars:  the Buffett Cup will be shown here from 13-16 September|pg||
nt|mich-b: In Israel there are quite a lot of "single session" . 30 boards "regional" events and those are very poular (pairs)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6 tables throughout|pg||
nt|flash: that event is extremely unusual, in that ALL scoring (pairs, teams and individual) is BAM|pg||
nt|mich-b: I think it is an excellent decision, because the event is relatively short|pg||
nt|mich-b: and Short IMP events are very random|pg||
nt|Walddk2: For vugraph schedule, please go to  http://online.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php  and bookmark it!|pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: enough|pg||
nt|mich-b: In some places , many would like to support @S by West|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Although 2@S is a better contract|pg||
nt|mich-b: But supporting with 3 card suits is not popular in Israel|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and so is 2@H|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|nt|flash: East has enough to invite (unfortunately)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@H a bit of a stretch imo|pg||
nt|flash: in a regular partnership, one might have methods to invite at the 2-level|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Much better, Jim. But then West might accept anyway|pg||
nt|mich-b: Yes, some play 2@C as a puppet to 2@D , and then 2@H would show the invitation|pg||
nt|flash: i know it won't happen at the table (and few would endorse it), but i don't think West has an opening bid...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Really?|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 13 and 5322 is no opening?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2 aces and a king|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|flash: and bidding 4@H here is simply wrong at this form of scoring|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I can't say I agree|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|nt|mich-b: I would surely open the West hand|pg||

nt|flash: my most abject apologies|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mich-b: this is mlikely to be played in 2@S|pg||
mb|1C|mb|d|nt|Walddk2: They seem to be playing a weak NT|pg||
nt|mich-b: Hmm , I assumed South would open 1NT...|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Unless South miscounted|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dJ|nt|mich-b: In @S , I think NS had a good play for 10 tricks|pg||
nt|mathat: only 9 trics in @s with @c lead|pg||
nt|mich-b: so the board looks lost for NS here|pg||
nt|mathat: and 7 rics in NT|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d5|pc|dK|pg||
nt|mich-b: a @C lead would not be likely after 1NT opening and a transfer|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|pc|cA|pc|c5|pg||
nt|mich-b: probably West would lead a @H|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c7|pc|c8|pc|c3|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s7|pc|s2|nt|mich-b: btw , I think there was some merit for North to consider correcting 1NT to 2@S here|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dQ|pc|dA|pc|d6|pg||
nt|mich-b: with South opening 1@C it is likely that at least one red suit is weak|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|nt|mich-b: and South can surely have 3@S ..|pg||
pc|h2|pc|c9|pg||
nt|flash: the allure of the extra 10 points in NT strikes again...   (but i agree with Michael - with all the length/strength in the black suits, 2@S stands out)|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sK|pc|s3|pc|s4|pg||
pc|dT|pc|s5|pc|d8|pc|d4|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|mathat: Based on total points, they will difficulty reach 6 @d|pg||
mb|1S|mb|d|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2N|nt|flash: 3NT would be rewarded handsomely|pg||
nt|mich-b: I think 2@D is a serious underbid|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|mich-b: North is easily worth 3@D|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mich-b: which is not Forcing here of course|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s9|nt|mich-b: EW need to cash 3 @S tricks|pg||
nt|mathat: bad bid from haramati after 2 NT 3 @d|pg||
nt|flash: i have no problems with 2@D here; but i think the same approach which led to NT last time has struck again|pg||
nt|mich-b: Zack is considering if he should underlead @S in trick 2|pg||
nt|flash: as Manos has suggested, rebidding the 5-card suit wouldn't rule out 3NT, but would describe the hand better|pg||
nt|mich-b: this could earn him a 3rd trick if wet led from Jxx|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mich-b: but could lose him a trick if declarer can cash 12|pg||

nt|mich-b: 4@H by North woyuld do better , 5@D would do worse|pg||
nt|Walddk2: End of round 2, short break|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6 rounds of 3 boards per session|pg||
nt|flash: Michael raises an interesting point - 4@H could turn disastrous on a 4-2 split with the @DK off-side|pg||
nt|flash: and the defense will lead and continue @Ss to start tapping declarer|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We should get score updates after each cycle of 6 boards. I'll keep you posted|pg||
nt|flash: if i'm trying to avoid losing the board, 3NT looks solid; if i'm trying to win the board, 4@H grabs all the MPs|pg||

nt|yuval10: currently, David Birman is surpassing Padon for 2nd place|pg||
nt|flash: for folks on this side of the pond (to make sense out of the results), although we score BAM as 1, .5 and 0, the scoring in Europe (and Israel) is almost universally 2-1-0|pg||
nt|yuval10: Saada and Boaziz had a terrific round - 9 out of 12, we could see that here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We are in Ra'anana, a city in the heart of the southern Sharon Plain of the Central District of Israel with a population of around 80,000. Ra'anana (means "fresh" if translated ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: literally) is bordered by Kfar Sava on the east and Herzliya on the southwest|pg||
nt|yuval10: indeed Roland, and for various reasons, Ra'anana has been the center of bridge in Israel|pg||
