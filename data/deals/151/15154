nt|jbgood: well put David, a less than perfect defense may even allow 3 spades to make|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm a nice freak|pg||
nt|roswolf: practical bidding in the other room|pg||
nt|vugraphzqn: they|pg||
nt|arno11: looked like making only 5 but...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Created by the Danish engineer, J.H. Monrad, for chess! in 1928|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It was soon afterwards adopted by bridge|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He could have played for the squeeze instead of the ruffing finesse. Both work after the lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: anyh theories as to why north didnt give pard the spade rufff?|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: @C7 might be a big card if east plays 3nt on a club lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphpl2: witamy kibicow|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w were slightly unlucky in the other room|pg||
nt|rv: I agree, if it at all it means something logical, it should be the expn of t/o of @s with max pre-empt (close to opening hand)|pg||
nt|athene: but i certainly would never ever bid it unless i KNEW partner would know it was forcing|pg||
nt|arno11: in the closed room EW apparently had a misunderstanding about the meaning of 2NT|pg||
nt|petergill: Excellent 5@C cue bid by Ben that led to the slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: may be duplicated|pg||
nt|tomi2: I dont like the double of 3@D, for me it does not show Kjxx, its just for the lead, think one should bid something to committ the partnership to 4th level to show the willing to ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: play 4@H or 5@D|pg||
nt|henryb:  reaching 6@h is well done|pg||
nt|arno11: making 6 was right in the last bd|pg||
nt|fabsayc: that delayed 2nt in closed room would be minors for me|pg||
nt|athene: 1nt raptor i assume|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's not often I disagree with Peter, but this slam was very bad|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So I would not use "excellent"|pg||
mb|1S|nt|marlowepi: in other words, it means "i should have opened 1H"|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no diamond raise form South|pg||
nt|athene: showing 4major and longer minor|pg||
nt|athene: standard in poland - i guess they double with a normal 1nt overcall|pg||
nt|fabsayc: will keep north out of trouble|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well should anyway|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: other major + longer minor?|pg||
nt|athene: i.e. we discussed it not earlier than 30 minutes before the start of the session :) |pg||
nt|mdgraham: at least it wasn't vulnerable - and you never know, maybe the opps will go in 6@S |pg||
nt|petergill: Here in Australia, players like me who know that penalty doubles exist often seem to end up in the national team - that's how rare penalty doubles seem to be in 2010|pg||
nt|arno11: wd to balance|pg||
nt|arno11: 2@D = one major|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@D = 1 major I assume|pg||
nt|Walddk2: :)|pg||
nt|arno11: :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The Multi-Landy defence|pg||
nt|blum1956: EW have a chance for a gain  their teammates losing only 300|pg||
mb|2N|an|!|nt|roswolf: same start as the other room|pg||
nt|athene: 2@D is asking for south's major, i am told|pg||
nt|athene: i think north has a shrewd idea which it will be|pg||
nt|mdgraham: sorry all, must go - I am summoned - enjoy the rest of the show |pg||
nt|peachy: I don't know what the alerted 2NT ,eams|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: yes 7@H would however be very unlucky|pg||
nt|othered1: Agree, forcing in lebensohl, but I know some who invert it (2N then 3@S forces, 3@S direct invites.)  Lets partner reject 3@Con the right hand.|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@D checkback|pg||
mb|4S|nt|roswolf: the @C10 might have been a good shot for the defence|pg||
nt|roswolf: even so dont particulary like dbl|pg||
nt|rv: Raptor is not very popular, Sandwitch nt to show other 2 suits after (1x)-(1y) is more popular|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@S to play opposite a spade suit|pg||
nt|peachy: means|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: so East should buy 4@s |pg||
nt|peachy: if it was a Precision 1D, I'm not surprised|pg||
nt|Walddk2: correctable if West has hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: you might bid 2@D anyway, as with two spades the opposition are likely to be raising  |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why on earth do you need Leb there when you have 2@S as sign off?|pg||
nt|peachy: some also have agreement on which sequence show/denies stopper|pg||
nt|athene: well as i said, it's less useful, certainly, but it still has SOME use|pg||
nt|athene: you can differentiate between weak and invitational hands with clubs|pg||
nt|othered1: Was 4@S fast arrival or just accepting game.  If fast arrival, they must have high standards for free bids, while many pairs lower their standards in comp.|pg||
nt|xenya: no way to beat this it seems|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4@h looksm pretty solid|pg||
nt|bernix: north has no reentry and he can read pard's @d6 as a very high card|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: and you can differentiate between forcing and invitational hands in a major|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe, but South had spades|pg||
nt|peachy: ty Mike|pg||
nt|vugraphzqn: 3@s supp|pg||
pc|c8|nt|roswolf: except north bid 3@S rather than 4@C|pg||
nt|brolucius: Not unreasonable for North to bid strongly on his hand, which has potential. 3@S by North at the other table was a bit on the cautious side.|pg||
nt|vugraphzqn: he missbid 3 @c|pg||
nt|vugraphzqn: then he bid 4@c|pg||
nt|roswolf: AAHHH|pg||
nt|rv: I prefer 1n O/C to show 15-18 though I like Sandwitch NT |pg||
nt|athene: east has a pretty good hand but she knows she is probably getting a club, rather than a spade, lead|pg||
nt|peachy: ty Tomislav|pg||
pc|c3|nt|athene: so her tiny club spots must be a concern|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the carnage in 2s doubled would have been massive|pg||
nt|lestergold: doubole dummy i thin 12 tricks as cards lie are available|pg||
pc|c7|nt|roswolf: 2nt = enquiry for minor!?|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@S is far far better than 3NT|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is tight but can/should go -1|pg||
nt|jbgood: .. and if you want to play 4 @s, you dont give away your hand by bidding 4 @c?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: matchpoint methods, IMHBAICO. i would never give up strong NT overcall at IMPs. variety of approaches is certainly interesting though|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not sure how they would locate a 4-4 heart fit if they had one|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|nt|Walddk2: 4@S is forcing to game in my book|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why make bridge so complicated|pg||
nt|athene: but now suddenly they aren't so tiny after all|pg||
pc|s2|nt|tihana: hi all|pg||
nt|mdgraham: amusing that East can't ruff a diamond in dummy |pg||
nt|athene: hi good evening|pg||
nt|tihana: from pula live :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In 2-way checkback Stayman you bid 2@H with that North hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: cheapest information first|pg||
nt|hedyg: by replying 2@h to the 2@d bid?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You can come back to 3-card spade support|pg||
nt|xenya: likely swing for Novi Cod, making up for the disaster on the previous hand|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|athene: he plays this way to force the defence to give him a black-suit finesse|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s6|nt|roswolf: very interesting and i agree raptor is a pairs gadget|pg||
nt|athene: and in theory if you subscribe to all the standard Lebensohl tenets you can show or deny a diamond stopper, etc|pg||
nt|arno11: hopefully not really the @C6|pg||
nt|vugraphzqn: asking for signals now...|pg||
nt|jaapfr:  |pg||
nt|vugraphzqn: but cant heard...sry..|pg||
nt|arno11: so 5 Imps to Zweili|pg||
nt|petergill: A low spade switch at Trick 2 would have been excellent defence|pg||
nt|hedyg: they seem to have Italian waiters in Pula|pg||
nt|petergill: sorry, I was wrong - 3NT has better chances than 4@S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I know, someone was about to go home and switched everything off|pg||
nt|blum1956: High crossruff, then take three trumps and you still have time to try smth with spades|pg||
nt|bernix: but in this instance he should have returned the 10 of @d. so that cant be the explanation|pg||
nt|lestergold: spade ruff now reduces to 11|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|tomi2: yes! this works well when partner has the ace, if not op will often nottake a finesse if he has some other play available|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@S  rubbish   3@S  invite   4@S  game   KISS|pg||
nt|othered1: To avoid missing good slams or getting too high on the wrong hands.|pg||
nt|hedyg: wow|pg||
nt|xenya: hard to believe it was 4 down|pg||
nt|petergill: play of 3NT was - West had shown @H's so @H8 lead to king, @D6 - 5 - low - king, then @SJ to king and low @D, playing partner for Qxx|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|s5|pc|c5|nt|athene: spade finesse immediately i would think|pg||
nt|arno11: but still no problem to make 9|pg||
nt|athene: then all is well|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s8|pg||
nt|peachy: Hi and thanks for joing here, a little local color never hurts!!!!!|pg||
nt|athene: you can often use elimination-type positions to this end|pg||
nt|tihana: we strongly support she - who goes to bad at 8 :)|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|mdgraham: don't mind where she goes, as long as she's bad :) |pg||
nt|athene: good girls go to heaven - bad girls go everywhere|pg||
nt|athene: well i agree, 4@S was the simple bid, but i am just saying what south's rationale was :)|pg||
nt|peachy: Roland is right, unless stron ground on artificial sequence bids, best just to bid what you think makes|pg||
nt|fabsayc: diamond return best|pg||
nt|arno11: shld be 400 and 6 Imps th EW|pg||
nt|petergill: Very hard for North to tell that it's not South who is short in clubs, I guess|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You would normally have six cards for the action Jerolitsch took, but you have got to bid the hand you are dealt. The world is not ideal|pg||
nt|arno11: 10 from 109x is never easy to see, most of the time you will think it shows only 2 cards|pg||
nt|petergill: Perhaps the clubs could have waited, perhaps on other layouts you need to take them at the start - I'm not sure|pg||
nt|xenya: still 8 tricks after a spade switch -- but might have depended on a heart guess if N played a trump at some point |pg||
nt|xenya: a heart i meant to say|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Those part-score swings are significant in short matches|pg||
pc|d3|nt|peachy: I'm thining he'll make an overtrick, but certainly at least 9|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|mdgraham: bad girls got to Essex |pg||
pc|c9|pc|c2|nt|Walddk2: I dislike too much science|pg||
nt|arno11: she|pg||
nt|peachy: Ahe, apologies|pg||
nt|peachy: She|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|brolucius: The defenders have made no mistake and declarer will have to look long and hard to find anywhere to ditch one of his two diamond losers. I wish him good luck.|pg||
nt|arno11: having 76 in @C now wld be nice....:)|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d7|nt|fabsayc: declarer is sort of squeezed, this is not a claimer|pg||
pc|h3|nt|marlowepi: so they play that a double of 1S is penalty? even playing gadgets i dont see any call but double on the S gand|pg||
nt|lestergold: 12 is always awkward because 4th spade had to be disposed off along with 2 dims that was 3 ruffs needed in dummy if declarer draws 1 round than south can play a second trumop when ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: in with K so perhaps 12 was always elusive|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|roswolf: or a revoke|pg||
nt|roswolf: a push|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hand, not gand (or gland)|pg||
nt|tihana: :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but we won't have any Essex Girl jokes here, thanks all the same|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|athene: yes, if she runs nine then plays @HA and another, she might find an overtrick drops into her lap|pg||
pc|d9|nt|Walddk2: Straightforward games do not create swings|pg||
pc|h8|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|athene: she might be thinking about throwing south in with one black suit to lead into the other|pg||
nt|athene: she knows south has a singleton heart|pg||
pc|d8|mc|11|nt|athene: so @HA, @C7 now is a sure thing isn't it?|pg||
nt|peachy: nice and relaxing hand last one was|pg||
pg||

nt|vugraphzqm: sofar nobody is asking|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rmb1: Opposition don't think they need to know at the moment, so sensibly aren't asking|pg||
nt|vugraphzqm: basically west was asking, but i can't hear what were the answers|pg||
mb|p|pc|d9|pc|dA|pc|d6|pc|d3|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|pc|s2|pc|sT|pg||
nt|rmb1: So East has show no 4 card major, a 4 card minor, a "serious" acceptance of spades, and 0/3 key card|pg||

nt|tomi2: this auction will not be duplicated here. Polish pairs play 1@D as negative over (1@C)-x-(p)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.pzbs.pl/wyniki/turnieje/2010/pula/team/pulateamleaderb.html  for running scores|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is a nasty hand for n/s|pg||
nt|rv: yes agree Marshall even playing raptor, X seems a good option|pg||
nt|athene: a good slam here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Leb me here, Rump be there. Too much can go wrong|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I repeat, KISS|pg||
nt|athene: yes, south's best line of defence is to throw a small spade, looking shifty|pg||
nt|athene: like a man baring an honour|pg||
nt|vugraphzqn: ...welcome back...sry...some small problems...|pg||
nt|petergill: Ben Handley-Pritchard's old partner Richard Probst once told me that Pula is a great resort and that one day I should go there then visit Plitvice National Park then wander down to ...|pg||
nt|petergill: Split and Dubrovnik. |pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: this looks a reasonable slam|pg||
nt|athene: unusual to play 3nt with a 5-4 major fit and unbalanced hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: needs to study body language of poker players|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 6@S needs 3-2 spades and no club ruff most of the time|pg||
mb|1N|nt|tomi2: ok over 1@D this does not work|pg||
nt|lestergold: interesting 3N a bit tight but a 9th trick develops in  hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: north mustnt get too carried away with his points|pg||
nt|brolucius: Krakow is a beautiful mediaeval city, where the restaurants serve a lot of game dishes, such as venison. A great place for a week's holiday.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: NS obviously not Precision, so it looks like 1@D was natural on the previous hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: same auction so far as in Closed Room|pg||
nt|mdgraham: good barrage|pg||
nt|tihana: S doesnt need much from p|pg||
nt|athene: south might just wheel out blackwood now, trusting his partner to have little wastage in diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: i think that is the practical decision|pg||
nt|athene: rare to see a 1@S response on this sort of hand|pg||
nt|athene: most people wheel out their trusty GF-major-raise, whatever it may be|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: do you bid 1@S or 1@H with north hand? and why?|pg||
nt|rv: 1@c is 3 way here|pg||
nt|peachy: 2S likely final contract here, unless NS interfere and push them to game|pg||
pc|c5|nt|roswolf: nor must west!!!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good evening to Peter Gill|pg||
nt|roswolf: what was 1nt supposed to be?|pg||
nt|petergill: Hi|pg||
nt|athene: wow|pg||
nt|arno11: has bid 2@C as no other way to invite is possible|pg||
nt|vugraphzqn: 1nt 15-17|pg||
pc|c6|nt|mdgraham: normal-looking stuff|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't like 2@S one bit|pg||
nt|athene: a heavy 2@S bid for sure|pg||
nt|petergill: I think Ben H-P is having a reunion with old friends in Pula - his country is not really Reunion|pg||
pc|cK|nt|marlowepi: to me 3D is hasty -- you might have a heart game. with this shape and nobody bidding spades, it is unlikely opps can outbid you, so go slow. if they bid more clubs, diamonds still ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: rank higher|pg||
nt|tihana: hihi|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@S is a rubber bridge bid|pg||
nt|mdgraham: any reason for not liking 2@S, Roland?|pg||
nt|othered1: What do you bid?  2@D?   Limited opening bid systems handle this hand better.\|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But the flag is colourful|pg||
nt|vugraphzqn: his countryes are Croatia and England...|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|athene: certainly you have to give partner a bit of slack since 3@S was bid under pressure and hence it's a "good 2@S bid up to a mediocre 3@S bid" - with a good 3@S bid north should just ...|pg||
nt|athene: bid game - but even so|pg||
nt|tihana: South should go to bed at 8 :) |pg||
nt|athene: well 2@D is more flexible|pg||
nt|peachy: slight ptoblem in the club department, declarer might end up with only 5 heart tricks in worst case|pg||
pc|h8|nt|jbgood: north is wondering who has the spades . if prd has them, he must be very weak|pg||
nt|henryb:  More to the point, do you make a takeout double of 1@d with South or remain a churchmouse, silent and waiting|pg||
nt|roswolf: i bid 1@H "UP THE LINE"|pg||
nt|bernix: likely push|pg||
pc|h3|nt|roswolf: fair comment|pg||
nt|rv: I would have bid 2@h on 1@d O/C to show @hs and @ds, fit showing jump|pg||
nt|rv: instead of 3@d by East|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes for me 3@D would show a worthless hand |pg||
nt|athene: a very nice fit and the heart onside means three overtricks i think, if declarer plays it flat out|pg||
nt|fabsayc: can pick up 2 imps for making seven|pg||
nt|hedyg: why bid 3@s?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2NT denies 3 spades|pg||
nt|Walddk2: so 3@S shows 2|pg||
nt|petergill: last board, other table = bad defence by West - should cash @DA as partner with @DQxx must be trusted to unblock @DQ under ace - ALWAYS trust partner in defence|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@D over 1@S would show the 18+ hand with at least 3 spades|pg||
nt|petergill: sorry, bad defence by East I mean|pg||
nt|hedyg: so much for finding 6@d then|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Don't know why Czerepak did not bid 3NT|pg||
pc|h4|nt|arno11: declarer might make all the tricks with @H s as trumps so a couple of imps back|pg||
nt|petergill: I will back the defence to beat 2NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@S was an excellent bid in case partner has six cards|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|roswolf: this should be a cakewalk|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No big deal here as they have so many high cards|pg||
pc|h7|nt|athene: flexible being the F-word that roland approves of :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: they should have some checkback system over 2NT to find 4 @hs and @s should not get mentioned again|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They can afford a load of trump losers|pg||
pc|h6|nt|roswolf: heart suit quality not good enough for me for a fit jump|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||
nt|tomi2: dont understand easts pass here. ater not selling out to 1@S and a raise by partner Game should be a good shot|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but spades is really where you live|pg||
nt|Walddk2: OK, we'll create an Engcro flag next time|pg||
nt|lestergold: hts have best chance for an extra trick any 3/3 break or as here the QT dropping and a lead up to the 9|pg||
pc|hK|nt|Walddk2: Yes, I bid 2@D. We could be cold for 5@D for all I know|pg||
nt|athene: you can't ruff two diamonds in dummy without east overruffing though so perhaps 12 is the limit|pg||
nt|blum1956: The declarer having eight top tricks, the defenders three, the fight for two remaining probably ends 1-1 here|pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: not when partner has @DKJxxx / @Sx|pg||
nt|peachy: With 6-4 and not a bad hand, opener rebids 2D, and bad hand 2S.  Matter of what opener evaluated, I think|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h2|pg||
nt|peachy: In the other room, it was South who bid 4D, thast could have excited North at least a little|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|athene: you don't like it when you get pre-empted out of a slam, but you like it less when you get pre-empting into a slam which doesn't make|pg||
nt|lestergold: well now a chance for an overtick|pg||
pc|s9|nt|fabsayc: 13 is cold with diamonds 33|pg||
nt|petergill: I'm still backing the defence to win the race, narrowly|pg||
nt|petergill: @CA I think, as north having a bare honour is more likely than KQ with South|pg||
pc|s3|nt|marlowepi: even if it is invitational in their methods i think it is both an underbid and tactically injudicious. |pg||
nt|roswolf: another push|pg||
nt|petergill: Bye all, I'm off to bed - NS team name is She Goes To Bed at 8pm", and it's 1am here in Sydney so "He Goes To Bed at 1am". |pg||
nt|lestergold: finesse that pesky 9 yes he did well done|pg||
pc|d3|pg||

nt|athene: some people always show the 4-card suit - i believe larry cohen wrote an article on it where he said that Berkowitz ALWAYS showed the lower-ranking suit|pg||

nt|roswolf: its mainly a matter of philosophy|pg||
nt|tihana: well in the other room North is SHE, so at least she's aware of it|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, outside your main suit you have two queens. Partner will need an exceptional hand for 5@D to be good |pg||

mb|1S|nt|vugraphpl2: dyskusja o poprzednim rozdaniu|pg||
nt|athene: 7@D here, if you want it enough|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it depends what you respond on x  xx  AKxxxxx Jxx, for example |pg||
nt|athene: not a textbook 1@D|pg||
mb|d|nt|arno11: 4@H likely contract here|pg||
nt|athene: more major-suit fits eschewed in favour of 3NT on this one in the other room|pg||
mb|4S|nt|jbgood: grands are rarely "easy" ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I like one of the team names in Group U, "She goes to bed at 8"   :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: normally i agree totally Jeff. i think there is a case, though, for loosening the suit-strength criteria when you are a passed hand. i could go either way on that|pg||
nt|athene: but no-one ever raises minors with five-card support these days so i doubt north will ever own up to a mere Q10 doubleton|pg||
nt|petergill: The Croatian-English defence was fine - that sounds like a Chess play|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1NT is the limit for N-S, EW can make 2@H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Multi defence|pg||

nt|Walddk2: http://www.pzbs.pl/wyniki/turnieje/2010/pula/team/pulateamleaderb.html  for running scores|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: nice slam to get to|pg||
nt|athene: that west hand is a classic example of an opening bid which you are supposed to pass after the opponents open (unless they open 1@H, when you can double)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Agreed|pg||
nt|athene: but people like to get into the auction early these days|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Trump lead|pg||
nt|hedyg: multilandy spreading like wildfire|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|roswolf: 3@C = MAYBE BOTH MAJORS? OR CONTROLS|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Geoff|pg||
nt|peachy: He could not Dbl, so the choices are Pass, 1D, 1S.  Of those, I like 1D|pg||
nt|athene: 1@S is definitely sick|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You don't even have to look at your cards|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Just find a small trump|pg||
nt|petergill: Not watching - but yesterday's Sydney newspaper had a long interview with Caroline Wozniacki the great Dane who is seeded  1|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: now N is worried that 4C wont be read as forcing|pg||
nt|rv: now North worth 4@c to show fit and extras (I like to play crossing 3n with minor fit shows extras)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: so he may bid 3S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: planning to bid 4C over 3N to reveal intentions|pg||
nt|athene: ok|pg||
nt|peachy: South prob should rebid diamonds, even with shape, he really does not have enough for reverse|pg||
nt|athene: he might have visions of 7@D now, the way the bidding has gone|pg||
nt|athene: north might|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@H would classically be a "reverse" - showing a much stronger hand|pg||
nt|athene: he can pretty much play the hand through in his head|pg||
nt|athene: win the heart or club lead, ruff spades good, draw trumps, get back with the other ace|pg||
nt|athene: Michael Rosenberg has said that when you are in a slam auction you should be trying to play the hand in the bidding|pg||
nt|peachy: So is Dbl...|pg||
nt|othered1: Feels wrong for 1@D, so pass seems clear|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Who says you can't get in later? Look at the CR auction|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Perfect|pg||
nt|athene: yes, west in the other room bid it straight out of the textbook|pg||
nt|othered1: non-space consuming overcalls work better when classic.|pg||
nt|athene: 4@H on a spade lead might be a slight worry?|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|athene: often you can see problems - for example if north didn't have BOTH side aces, declarer might be short of an entry for reaching the good spades|pg||
nt|peachy: Ed speaks the truth!|pg||
nt|athene: bidding 1@D meant west actually competed the hand less|pg||
nt|mdgraham: looks like a couple off for a flat board|pg||
nt|othered1: Could be a couple of imps to LMPS here|pg||
nt|lestergold: gross overbidding |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|roswolf: wasnt 2@D setting up a gf|pg||
nt|jcmax: E's 2@H seems to be NF. Still quite courageous, not everyone would bid it|pg||
nt|bernix: very optimistic 4@h bid by east|pg||
pc|d5|nt|tomi2: seemy both tables will sell the W hand as strong balanced. I think one could open 1@D|pg||
nt|tomi2: both black suits are stopped but the stops dont run away|pg||
pc|dA|nt|tihana: wow|pg||
nt|peachy: wow, North trusted South to actyually have the reverse values|pg||
nt|athene: ok - i apologise for doubting him - he DID show Q10 doubleton!|pg||
nt|athene: well you can't bid much less than 7 after partner reversed|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well done North - influenced by South's reverse, perhaps|pg||
nt|athene: i would have thought it was an underbid if anything|pg||
nt|peachy: exactly, sometimes unconventional bidding pays|pg||
nt|tihana: very different approaches from Grosset and Dombi|pg||
nt|athene: he will probably expect his partner to have that hand but with the @HKQ too so even if the spades can't be used, there will be enough tricks anyway, perhaps with a heart ruff|pg||
nt|peachy: In the other room S did not open, that decision is unusual as well|pg||
nt|athene: yes the diamonds got sort of lost in the other room|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@H goes 1 down but that is still 2 IMPs to the enemy. Not insignificant in an eight-board match|pg||
nt|athene: probably just one down at worst|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is touch and go|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, if you can make a slam in a suit, someone has to bid the suit at some stage|pg||
nt|peachy: His only line is to develop the spades, so he'll just do that and hope|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you won't bid 7@D if all you bid is spades, clubs, and no-trumps |pg||
nt|athene: http://www.pzbs.pl/wyniki/turnieje/2010/pula/team/pulateamleaderb.html  for running scores|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can make with 4-2 spades - he doesn't need 3-3|pg||
nt|mdgraham: in the other room South resonded 1NT to 1@S. As a passed hand, there doesn't seem much wrong with 2@D  |pg||
nt|athene: but if the spades need two ruffs declarer has only three discards and he needs a heart ruff too|pg||
nt|athene: declarer, understandably, is taking his time|pg||
nt|tihana: a mach with two grands already bid.|pg||
nt|athene: you are a bit worried about spade over-ruffs from west|pg||
nt|athene: if you start ruffing spades high you might find you lose a trump trick if they break 4-1|pg||
nt|tihana: @S3 would be nice lead :)|pg||
nt|othered1: I th ink you hold @C losers to 1 by pitching on @S|pg||
nt|athene: you might have to be careful not to run into a trump promotion on three rounds of spades, @HA, fourth spade perhaps|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Will probably go 1 down|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But N-S had already lost the board when E-W bid 2@H|pg||
nt|blum1956: polish players rarely stop short of game|pg||
nt|peachy: East has too much defense to unilaterally go to 4S, he had a slower route available surely, to see what the overcall was about|pg||
nt|peachy: one-level, some folks might have a leaddirecting overcall, instead of game aspirations|pg||
nt|peachy: Still, NS were talked out of their potential 4H so all might be well|pg||
pc|sA|nt|petergill: Consus is EW's sponsor - a major company in Poland - Consus is involved in emissions trading schemes or something like that|pg||
nt|rv: if North had min he could have passed 3@c even if 2@d was not setting GF, in my book 4@c should be forcing|pg||
nt|roswolf: or not as the case may be|pg||
nt|lestergold: and even with K@h right its off|pg||
nt|peachy: Normally, 5-card support calls for aggressive action, and it has paid off here|pg||
pc|s5|nt|marlowepi: N apparently worried that 3rd suit forcing does not set up a GF, or else that his pd wont be sure it does, or else that "GF" auctions can still die at 4m|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Don't understand the small club from Iris|pg||
pc|s2|nt|roswolf: 3NT IS VERY FORTUNATE|pg||
nt|athene: the defence can't open up the clubs|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|athene: of course declarer has to find the @HJ anyway even without that, not to mention finding ten tricks :)|pg||
pc|s8|nt|roswolf: strong with 5 spades apparently|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|roswolf: fell short - indeed not as easy as it seems|pg||
nt|petergill: 4NT RKCB should in my opinion be followed by 5NT by South, to let North know that NS has all the keycards and trump queen|pg||
pc|d4|nt|athene: spade ruff low, @HA, then have a think :)|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps it would have been better to cash the @HA first actually? if you are planning on two spade ruffs and one heart ruff|pg||
nt|athene: you don't ever want to have to overtake a diamond honour from dummy|pg||
nt|athene: or you really are squandering too many big diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: never a wise plan in today's financial climate|pg||
nt|peachy: "No Double" and no heart contract:)|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|athene: so maybe @SA, @HA, spade ruff, heart ruff, cash diamond from dummy, spade ruff was better|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|pc|hQ|nt|roswolf: 12 top tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Henry Bethe|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's on a finesse, not that fortunate|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Must finesse spades to make it|pg||
nt|henryb:  needs the @s finesse. and a little luck in a pointed suit: either 3-3 @s or @d coming home|pg||
nt|jbgood: cllose your eyes and open them again after the spade jack wins:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: but lots off if finesse is wrong|pg||
nt|tomi2: in 5@D you lose two aces but can survive without finesses|pg||
nt|athene: you might even endplay west sometimes and make it, on a very good day|pg||
pc|h3|nt|brolucius: South had the option, presumably, of bidding 5NT after his 4NT. This would tell partner that all the key cards were held and invite him to bid a grand slam. |pg||
nt|peachy: now has to ruff a heart and hope diamonds split|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this line will need 3-2 trumps, as South can't get back to hand after a heart ruff without overtaking, and if he takes a club ruff he can't get back to dummy|pg||
nt|athene: yes, exactly|pg||
nt|athene: i think cashing the @HA at trick 2 was definitely an improvement on this line|pg||
pc|h4|nt|petergill: Then North might bid the grand. |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now I do|pg||
pc|h5|nt|athene: he has no options now does he? he can't ever ruff high here|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|roswolf: whereas 5@D is gin|pg||
nt|hedyg: hi Henry|pg||
pc|c8|nt|rv: slam auctions become too diff, if both North and South both want to have Inv bids after South has shown min |pg||
pc|c2|nt|marlowepi: and over 3N, N was worried that if he bid on terorists would kill his children. only explanation i can think of for not bidding 4C over 3N|pg||
pc|c5|nt|athene: for example cash the spades first, THEN club to queen, then club back and duck it to west|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Matches, particularly short ones, are usually won on partscore swings, not straightforward games|pg||
nt|vugraphzqn: hii|pg||

mb|p|nt|roswolf: the other room had no problem - a bow and arrow approach 3-5-6|pg||
nt|athene: yes of course, i was just talking about 2@S tick vs 2@H not-quite-tick|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It is often effective|pg||
nt|arno11: quite strong for a 4@S opening bid as chosen in the closed room|pg||

mb|1N|nt|athene: 2@C from south i guess|pg||

nt|Walddk2: http://www.pzbs.pl/wyniki/turnieje/2010/pula/team/pulateam2leaderb.html  for running scores|pg||
nt|othered1: is east thinking of (garbage) STayman?|pg||
nt|athene: but you don't expect all this (and @HQ too) with west opening a weak-2@S|pg||
nt|peachy: took th bull by the horns|pg||
nt|athene: one area of the game that most partnerships don't discuss nearly enough (i.e. at all) is advancing a 3nt overcall|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not at all clear if south should show his suit|pg||
nt|peachy: true, however general principles could apply. Systems on whenever they can be|pg||
nt|athene: usually problems occur after a 3-level pre-empt when a 3NT overcall can be really wide-ranging|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, pretty squeeze|pg||
nt|lestergold: because west is looking at a minimum opening and was forced to bid in any case as i assumethat east's 2@h was forcing it would normally be in natural mthods|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzqn: i think he was...:)|pg||
nt|athene: you aren't weak enough to be bidding it out of fear|pg||
nt|mdgraham: why should he?|pg||
nt|arno11: 1@S might have been 4 cards and a longer suit that´s why the alert|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 2@C=good raise to 2@H|pg||
nt|athene: and you aren't strong enough to have game interest|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now you can set up your 7th trick in hearts|pg||
nt|athene: so i think 1NT passed is the goldilocks call - just right|pg||
nt|Walddk2: win king and play another one|pg||
nt|mdgraham: an ace and a king don't usually add up to enough for game opposite a strong NT|pg||
nt|othered1: must north capitulate honors with south?|pg||
nt|peachy: including here|pg||
nt|arno11: true, 3N cld easily be based on a running minor and be much better than 4@H..|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: it is not a question of "cancelling" a GF. there is a case for allowing "strong" auctions to die at 4m, because not every hand that wants to play 3N if a certain suit is stopped ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: would be thriolled to contract for 11 tricks if it isnt|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so (usually) 2@H is the weakest bid North can make|pg||
nt|athene: east has a lot to say - he has a 1nt bid, a negative double and a club raise|pg||
nt|peachy: I like Dbl|pg||
nt|athene: but clubs are raised even less often than diamonds these days of course|pg||
nt|petergill: I too would open 1@S, unless I was playing the Namyats convention. Much too strong for 4@S|pg||
nt|hedyg: 14-16 NT?|pg||
nt|vugraphzqn: not alerted|pg||
nt|hedyg: np|pg||
nt|peachy: Probably POlish Clubs so whatever is the normal range in that sys?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|Walddk2: Ignore that|pg||
nt|fabsayc: good bid|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, East had to pitch his exit card in hearts|pg||
pc|s6|nt|petergill: East is one of the world's greatest players. His website is http://www.martensuniversity.com/. |pg||
nt|brolucius: North's 2@H means that he want to go no higher (understandably) if South's major is hearts.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Suitable for a Namyats, is it not?|pg||
nt|hedyg: J@S lead in CR|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|rv: it essentially means you are cancelling GF:)|pg||
nt|athene: north's hand gets a lot better when partner has a long suit|pg||
nt|fabsayc: and a practical one|pg||
nt|peachy: Took the bull by the horns, twice in this auction:)|pg||
nt|athene: north can pretty much play the hand in the bidding|pg||
nt|arno11: bidding 4@S vs. the strong NT was worth a game swing on bd 23|pg||
nt|athene: draw trumps whilst ruffing the diamonds good|pg||
nt|athene: loads of entries to his hand (having a 25 count has that effect)|pg||
nt|peachy: heh, Bill :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: we must assume they play either 12-14 or 14-16 since there is no cause for upgrade here|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|arno11: development not unlucky for NS, but still well done|pg||
pc|h6|nt|xenya: here, too, trump lead was best -- but hard to find |pg||
nt|Walddk2: A straightforward line is to win the queen, enter dummy with a club and take a diamond finesse|pg||
nt|Walddk2: When that works you can safely play for the overtrick|pg||
nt|lestergold: any suggestion that anyone here plays natural methods is of course purely speculative|pg||
nt|bernix: he raises with 4 trumps whether 2@h was forcing or not|pg||
nt|hedyg: normally 15-17 in Polish @c|pg||
pc|hK|nt|Walddk2: http://www.bridgeguys.com/Conventions/Namyats.html|pg||
nt|jcmax: good trump lead by E here|pg||
pc|h4|nt|petergill: Martens' books and training are highly recommended - some of his books have been translated into English|pg||
nt|brolucius: South doubles 3@H to tell partner that this is his suit. If he omitted to do this, North might on some auctions bid high in spades, assuming that South held spades.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: a question of wording i guess. you could call it a "conditional game force" too|pg||
nt|roswolf: west probably converted a plus into a minus by bidding 4@H|pg||
nt|lestergold: well was 3@h forcing surely not and to raise this to game with south's hand i would need a gun to my head|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|peachy: difficult to pass 2H, their last chance for a plus|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|athene: 2@H would be interesting but i guess it might go one down|pg||
pc|s7|nt|Walddk2: There is no 7th trick when the spade finesse is off|pg||
nt|athene: small spade from hand is a possible play|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: try to set up the long spade|pg||
nt|arno11: @D ducked better as in CR|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|brolucius: It seems to me that East's 3@H was a bit risky, since it might have been read as natural (with South's suit not yet known). But West held hearts and did not raise so they clearly ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: knew what they were doing.|pg||
nt|petergill: At least 1100 looks achievable if East can double 2@H for take-out and West converts to penalty|pg||
nt|jbgood: perhaps it would have paid off to double 2 hearts? |pg||
nt|jbgood: unlucky lead|pg||
nt|athene: would be touch and go between one down and making|pg||
pc|sT|pc|d3|nt|petergill: When you have the boss suit, with opponents not vul (less likely to save at 5 level), there is less need to preempt them out of the auction - so opening 1@S (in case 6@S is on) ...|pg||
nt|petergill: makes sense |pg||
pc|s8|nt|blum1956: Was 3@h forcing this time?   )))))|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|brolucius: Perhaps that would have shown hearts?|pg||
nt|petergill: At both tables, the vulnerable penalty was not taken|pg||
nt|peachy: this was not an easy hand for East|pg||
nt|athene: it doesn't help to cash the diamonds throwing the hearts away - south can ruff and still make a trump trick|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Try to read Namyats backwards|pg||
pc|h3|nt|vugraphzqn: ...REALLY TOO FAST...SRY|pg||
nt|othered1: In the CR, looks like east essentially did treat the hand as "garbage" Stayman.|pg||
nt|peachy: good discard|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jbgood: even clearer to double by E in the other room...|pg||
nt|petergill: I think 2HX is only 1100 - trump promotion for 1400 is not available, I think|pg||
nt|athene: the alternative way to play this sort of 1NT contract is to lead clubs|pg||
nt|athene: that can have two benefits|pg||
nt|athene: firstly it might cause the defence to attack other suits you want them to|pg||
nt|lestergold: i dont think so i think Mr.pritchard has been chasing too many pretty croatian girls|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|Walddk2: It is no coincidence|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|d7|nt|athene: but even if they don't do that it can tighten up the position for endplays without losing too many tricks|pg||
nt|hedyg: or 2|pg||
nt|hedyg: good duck of J@s|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|nt|arno11: but there S played @D instead of trump, but I guess all roads will lead to success|pg||
nt|blum1956: I probably have preferred the 2NT rebid for North if not conventional|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|roswolf: 1100 is never bad|pg||
nt|Walddk2: or 3 overtricks :)|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|jcmax: E felt sort of end-played here. A @S wasn't best really. he will be in again with the @CA|pg||
nt|lestergold: east sort of endplayed but surely should have got out of the way with that stiffago A@c|pg||
nt|blum1956: The spade lead allowes that to make|pg||
pc|d5|nt|rv: West 's hand is tempting to pass 3n, I generally like to pass with 4333 and min hand|pg||
pc|d2|nt|athene: 6@H was not a wild bid at all - as can be judged from the fact that south couldn't really have any less and this is making an overtrick|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|henryb:  unluckier shift|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|Walddk2: He could have won that heart|pg||
pc|d6|nt|petergill: The top Italians would just overcall 1@H on the grounds that the flat 6322 shape (no singleton nor void) is unsuitable for vulnerable premption. |pg||
pc|dT|pc|c3|pg||
nt|hedyg: could have, should have|pg||
nt|jcmax: Now E cannot prevent DEclarer from getting to dummy to pitch his @S loser on the @DK|pg||
pc|d9|nt|Walddk2: Then East would have been squeezed|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c7|nt|Walddk2: In Norway they play a convention named Yeslek. Try to read that one backwards|pg||
nt|jcmax: Alternatively he can play up into the @SAQ again|pg||

nt|roswolf: very restained by west|pg||
nt|athene: if the defence had started spade to the ace, spade ruff, east would have had a horrible dilemma|pg||
nt|athene: you might lead small from the ace and if east plays low, put in the ten, and if that loses to the jack, run the queen, on the basis that east wouldn't duck with @SKx|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You can't look at the spade suit in isolation, Bill|pg||
nt|othered1: But the possiblilites are limited by other considerations on the actual hands.|pg||

nt|Walddk2: certainly|pg||
nt|petergill: I think Kelsey's books on bridge odds (co-written with Glauert) and squeezes (much easier to read than Clyde Love's book) and ultra-expert card play book (with Ottlik) are all ...|pg||
nt|petergill: great, and his classics Killing Defence and More Killing Defence are OK too|pg||
nt|petergill: At least @H's are 3-3, unlike spades|pg||
nt|petergill: and @H10 to ruff a spade might be an entry to the clubs - I wonder if he can make this - would require fine play |pg||

nt|athene: this should be a nice simple auction - maybe west will ask for the @CK|pg||
nt|arno11: :)|pg||
nt|athene: but if west just didn't know what to do, that suggests he needs to discuss defence to polish 1@C |pg||
nt|hedyg: i dont see the merit of bidding 3 @H here, even with 3 cards|pg||
nt|hedyg: not to mention with 2..|pg||
nt|lestergold: well i flat hand here unl;ess Roland is at table when he would want to be in 6@s on the finesse|pg||
nt|jcmax: This is a slam that will be avoided by everybdoy that plays Key card Blackwood|pg||
nt|hedyg: everybody who has been says it is great from all points of view|pg||
pc|s5|nt|jbgood: a very cautious comment ...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that would be good, and is a useful meaning of 5N in this kind of auction |pg||
nt|athene: but really how can he not have that?|pg||
nt|athene: one thing about polish club is that people playing it open 1@C a LOT|pg||
nt|petergill: @D7 or @SQ lead?|pg||
nt|lestergold: except Roland|pg||
pc|s2|nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|vugraphzqn: w question S about that 2@s...|pg||
nt|vugraphzqn: strong with supp|pg||
nt|athene: but if you go for some sort of crossruff you might run into too many overruffs in hearts perhaps|pg||
nt|athene: so you really need to know what you are doing over it|pg||
nt|arno11: interesting contract but 2 will be easy|pg||
nt|peachy: was 1D a transfer, or some point count range?|pg||
nt|athene: 1@D negative|pg||
nt|athene: or might be some strong hands but usually negative|pg||
nt|peachy: ty, I am not that familiar with Polish Club|pg||
nt|athene: if they are playing normal Polish|pg||
nt|petergill: Leading the Beer Card (@D7) = same choice as me |pg||
pc|sK|nt|Walddk2: He can't have 3 when he did not support hearts before, can he?|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|othered1: which is what declarer in CR did, but he played @SA before ruffing @D and things came apart from there|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They seem to like 5-2 fits|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Also on board 10|pg||
nt|hedyg: some dont support with xxx and minimum|pg||
nt|jcmax: It is really quite funny. People love to bids slam on a finesse. But hardly anyone can do it anymore when it is the trump king that is missing.|pg||
nt|blum1956: The slam being almost 50% EW happily stopped short|pg||
pc|sA|nt|rv: 2@h shows 4@h <11 hcp|pg||
nt|roswolf: i missed an ace - ihave enough for game - i found another ace - easy peasey|pg||

nt|Walddk2: I would be very upset if my partner did not support my 5+ suit with 3|pg||

pc|s6|nt|athene: west can count 12 tricks|pg||
nt|peachy: This will be a quick -1|pg||

nt|blum1956: few methods to distinguish between the trump King and an Ace|pg||
nt|jcmax: A good friend of mine used to have this theory: When the opponents open the bidding or when they preempt, key card Blackwood is not on anymore, just normal aces. The idea being one ...|pg||

pc|cJ|nt|petergill: Dominik Filipowicz is much younger than Martens|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2@H showed a minimum hand (in response to the take-out double), so the 4@C splinter bid was pushing it a bit. Could have been a slam there, I suppose.|pg||
nt|athene: but you have too big a diamond fit to go for a crossruff comfortably|pg||
pc|c7|nt|petergill: I agree about the "pushing it a bit"|pg||
nt|othered1: you do have pretty good trump pips.  Losing both high @S on overruffs, plus the @S7 would be cruel.|pg||

mb|p|nt|brolucius: At least his singleton was in the suit that had been overcalled, which suggested that partner's values would be in the other three suits - just where they were needed.|pg||
nt|rv: thx Tomislav, continue the great job|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Anyone for 4@C now?|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt possible from west now|pg||
nt|othered1: Penalty doubles anyone?|pg||
nt|peachy: Not sure if anyone plays Dbl there is penalty|pg||
nt|vugraphzqn: see xou in 15 minutes...|pg||
nt|lestergold: on today'su;tra light and cheeky bidding that does not apply so much anynore|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphpl2: gajcyk chcial grac 2@d z X|pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks a push in 4@H|pg||
nt|petergill: Consus Oil's sponsorship of bridge is thanks to Piotr Wasiak, I think |pg||
nt|rv: this is weak bal nt version of Polish @c|pg||
nt|athene: of course east might have had @SAxxx @HAQxx @DQxx @CAK :) but in that case it's just not your day|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They do not exist below 7@H, Ed|pg||
nt|othered1: Some of us do.|pg||
nt|athene: if west does bid 3nt, east's excitement will be lessened, as he knows there are wasted club cards opposite|pg||
nt|athene: if west had shown a good spade raise, east would not have stopped below about lotsof@S|pg||
nt|peachy: for those interested in the beer http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_card|pg||
nt|arno11: also 6NT on the lucky lie of the @D suit...|pg||
mb|1C|nt|brolucius: North might consider a slam opposite a 2NT opening, but not opposite a strong 1NT.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: you might open 1@H with that, not 1@C|pg||
nt|mdgraham: unless 5cM, of course|pg||
nt|fabsayc: south could have treated his hand by opening 1c and jumping in spades|pg||
nt|fabsayc: perhaps a little shy in sure tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphzqn: thx Martin, Arno, Raija and Walter...thx Roland and kibbs...:)|pg||
nt|athene: is 3@C invitational? seems a bit strong if so|pg||
nt|vugraphzqn: ...we are starting in 21.00 in the evening with 10th round...|pg||
nt|peachy: Vugraph schedule here, for todays and for future shows. ALl times local to you: http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php|pg||
mb|1D|an|usually not 4 majors if he isnt strong|nt|rv: 13-15 bal|pg||
nt|peachy: I like 3NT, even with spade support|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They use a 12-0 VP scale|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.pzbs.pl/wyniki/turnieje/2010/pula/team/pulateam2leaderb.html  for running scores|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: polish standards for 2 over 1 overcalls are quiet low, I would pass that hand. qtz73 cries for trapping pass and reopening double|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3nt is a fair shot here|pg||
nt|othered1: But why was it alerted?|pg||
nt|athene: yes, 4333 is notrump shape|pg||
nt|athene: we know that east feels that way - on board 9 he chose 3nt with 4333 when his partner had five spades|pg||
nt|athene: so it's good to see the partnership is in tune :)|pg||
nt|othered1: Looks like 6@S making 5, 3N making 6.  Odd.|pg||
mb|2N|nt|athene: hmmm - i was expecting south to say he had a minimum, which isn't usually 3nt|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5@C is better than 3NT|pg||
nt|petergill: and last but not least Ben H-P photo is at http://worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=3464|pg||
nt|vugraphzqn: ...last board of this match...thx comentator and kibbss....|pg||
nt|arno11: over 3@C E has a difficult rebid, as eg 3@D wld show 5 @D 4@S  |pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: Heading for a flat board here|pg||
nt|peachy: depends on what 2NT asked|pg||
nt|mdgraham: maybe by the NS standards that isn't a minimum - in which case, I'd like to see one|pg||
nt|fabsayc: either way this is an absolute maximum 1@S opener in polish club|pg||
nt|peachy: Thank you TOmislav, great job as operator, much appreciated|pg||
nt|arno11: making 5 for a flat board|pg||
nt|vugraphzqn: and William ofcourse...:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Sometimes you go down in 3NT when 5@C is cold, never the other way around|pg||
nt|lestergold: south has to put in a leadm directional bid I suppose|pg||
mb|3N|nt|roswolf: e/w in the other room did well to find 5@C|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i am guessing RD by S would show a better hand|pg||
nt|athene: that's really a pretty bad hand for a second-seat weak 2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it's that extra club trick|pg||
nt|arno11: thx everyone, nice close match|pg||
nt|blum1956: the EW can make up to 3NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: Consus just scored another big swing|pg||
nt|rv: I would have bid 1@h with North or XX from South as SOS instead of 1@d|pg||
nt|peachy: Especially, thank you specs for your comments and tips|pg||
nt|vugraphzqn: see you in 15 mins....|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I like 3@C as a catch-all bid after 4th suit with that hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No descriptive bid available|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphpl2: odpytuja sie z systemu|pg||
nt|tomi2: and if we make game, i pass and west will pass to, partner will reopen with double or 1nt. if he cant reopen we are favortes to have no game on|pg||
nt|tihana: 3N is a beuty |pg||
nt|hedyg: 4th from longest and strongest........|pg||
pc|h7|nt|jbgood: it doesnt always work that way, Thomas, so I must admit I would bid 2@h|pg||
nt|Walddk2: oh, 2@C was not game-forcing|pg||
nt|lestergold: why support partner's 5 c ard suit with 3 when you have 5 cards to the umph in ur own suit|pg||
nt|hedyg: ohhhhhh|pg||
pc|h3|nt|rv: yes maybe XX by South shows a strong variety of Polish @c|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@c was xyz|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@d forced bid|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and smile....|pg||
nt|tihana: buc|pg||
nt|athene: it's certainly getting more beautiful by the minute|pg||
nt|othered1: Really the lead consideration, and that emphasizes the benefit of 3N, not to mention thatnorth may be ready to ruff @C|pg||
nt|athene: north will no doubt be happy to find his "costly" lead didn't cost at all|pg||
nt|athene: he just lost the same 12 imps either way :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: Be4n has made one or two undisciplined bids in this session|pg||
nt|hedyg: why do my opps never lead like this?|pg||
nt|peachy: With entries n hand, standard lead 4th would have been more effective|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@ss, 2@hs, 2@ds 1@c = 9 tricks|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|marlowepi: 2C by E seems excessively modest|pg||
nt|hedyg: surely Zsak was confident that 3NT would be easy when he put down dummy with 2 aces!|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cT|pc|c2|pg||
nt|jbgood: fortunately bridge players have different approaches - else it would be a dull game|pg||
nt|athene: declarer might not know the diamond position so he will want to ruff the clubs down for a diamond pitch|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thanks Tomislav|pg||

nt|vugraphzqn: thx all...see you in about 20 minutes for the last rount for today...|pg||
nt|athene: can start three rounds of spades, but on a heart shift he wins the king and goes for clubs right away|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and thanks Peter, Vladimir and Arno|pg||
nt|arno11: shld enter hand with a @H and play @C ducking if the Q appears|pg||
nt|petergill: !@HQ to ace then low club ducking if South produces bare queen is a safety play in case North has @CJxx and South has five diamonds to ace|pg||
pc|d5|nt|rv: I prefer 1@d O/C by West and bid later instead of X|pg||
nt|arno11: thx all|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bye for now|pg||
nt|petergill: so Arno and I would make less tricks than these Easts did!|pg||
nt|xenya: thanks everyone|pg||
nt|arno11: :)|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dA|nt|lestergold: 1@h didnt even take up space absolutely pointless noise|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3C more like it, and even that may be an underbid. the fact that S ran from 1C is telling|pg||
nt|athene: ok, now claim looks the best line|pg||
nt|athene: thanks all|pg||
pc|c9|nt|peachy: thx everyone|pg||

nt|vugraphzqn: Mergl :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: and my fellow commentators restart in 15 mins|pg||
nt|jbgood: so long|pg||
nt|roswolf: bye for now|pg||
nt|brolucius: The second big swing to Consus was on the 4@H hand that was apparently misplayed by declarer here too, but let through by North.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer was allowed to go down at the other table.|pg||
nt|vugraphzqn: see you in 15 minutes...thx all...|pg||
nt|petergill: Interesting to see how the swing to Consus on Bd 7 arose - in 4@H Martens seemed to keep more options open in the play and gained a major swing when trumps broke 4-1|pg||
nt|petergill: Not at all easy to know how to play that 4@h on Bd 7|pg||
nt|petergill: Bye all|pg||
pc|h8|nt|xenya: stopping in 3@H looks entirely reasonable, if a bit unlucky|pg||
pc|s6|nt|tomi2: i think he could go down if EW cut off communication and establish clubs|pg||
nt|roswolf: west played too quickly|pg||
pc|c6|mc|8|nt|hedyg: and if @ss dont come in finesse in @c|pg||

pc|hA|nt|roswolf: well that looks strong|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@C  17+|pg||
nt|xenya: Hi Peter and Roland|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and hi to our operator, Tomislav|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Polish Club presumably|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1. 12-14 balanced - 2. 15+ with clubs - 3. Any 18+|pg||
nt|lestergold: lets see if his bridge is printable!?|pg||
nt|peachy: Hello Mike|pg||
pc|h5|nt|peachy: Hello Tomislav and Bill|pg||

pc|h3|pc|h6|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Used to, they don't any more|pg||
nt|Walddk2: MU have AON now|pg||

nt|Walddk2: We will be starting with boards 23 and 24 in this room, followed by comparisons from the other table when we circle back to board 17|pg||
nt|peachy: EW are from Poland, NS from Hungary|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|vugraphpl2: gajcyk wypytuje o licytacje|pg||
nt|brolucius: If they are playing Polish Club, 1@C may be a strong hand but is more likely to be based on a weak 1NT (if they rebid 1NT).|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@H maybe?|pg||
nt|roswolf: here definitely strong!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's not necessarily strong. Polish Club 1@C is ... 1. 12-14 balanced (often) - 2. 15+ with clubs - 3. Any 18+ hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: all friendly as it should be so this will make easily|pg||
nt|petergill: This lead attacks the entry to dummy's clubs |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good afternoon to Arno Lindermann from Austria|pg||
nt|arno11: hi everybody|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Arno|pg||
nt|vugraphzqn: hii comentators, hii Roland, hii kibs...welcome all..|pg||
nt|petergill: She Goes To Bed at 8pm leads the event with Zweili 2nd|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@C shgows the 18+ hand and denies as much as 3 hearts|pg||
nt|hedyg: how would he show 15+ with @cs?|pg||
pc|h7|nt|roswolf: true|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is 3.|pg||
nt|arno11: well done by EW|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes it is. Always difficult to bid a game when an opponent opens a strong NT|pg||
nt|peachy: But once you get there, only few if any guesses, when one opp is know to have strong NT|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mdgraham: Good evening all.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: all routes lead to 4@S it seems|pg||
nt|petergill: M Czerepak used to partner Marek Markowski who has for many years been npc of Polish youth teams|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6 obvious tricks here 7th may need help from teh defence|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|peachy: Welcome to Mike Graham, from England|pg||
nt|athene: you might expect NS to lock into spades after the 1@S opener, with south having three|pg||
pc|hT|nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@D is 0-7|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes i agree, but italian style takeout double lands on feet once again|pg||
nt|roswolf: agreed rv|pg||
pc|h8|nt|brolucius: West decides he is not worth anything stronger than 4@H (such as 4@C, splinter) because East limited his hand with the 1@D response.|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|roswolf: and a diamond switch!?|pg||
nt|tomi2: they send two teams to Pula it seems. North is Krzystof Martens, he wrote several books in the past years, if you are an advanced or expert player and want to improve your game, ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: think about his books|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, they have a better fit in hearts :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 15 and 16 first, followed by comparisons from the other table when we circle back to board 9|pg||
nt|petergill: South will duck|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|henryb:  3@c goes down 4, which is even better than the lucky slam|pg||
pc|h9|nt|Walddk2: 1@S can still be a weak NT and is forcing|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@H obviously confirms the 18+ hand|pg||
pc|d3|nt|roswolf: yes the italians have a lot to answer for|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Down 1 not too bad, N-S can make some diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|peachy: The other commentators for this match are Bill Frisby, England, and Raija Davis USA|pg||
pc|d5|nt|peachy: declare needs to pay spades for one loser. Or else get rid of a diamond loser, to make|pg||
nt|athene: i would just transfer and then bid 3nt with that west hand|pg||
nt|petergill: I think declarer should win @SA, then play a @D before the clubs|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|petergill: in order to try for the 9th trick early, in case the defence can cash 4 @Hs and 1 @D|pg||
nt|lestergold: actually even 8 not that easy|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6 i mean|pg||
pc|h4|nt|roswolf: trump is even better|pg||
nt|petergill: NS playing upside down count|pg||
pc|s2|nt|arno11: Iris Grümm has always been a member of the austrian ladies team in recent years, Stefan is a former junior internationalist, both in their late twenties|pg||
nt|athene: maybe south thought his partner showed two hearts rather than four|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s5|pg||
nt|rv: this rates to be 1 down, can NS manoeur a @c ruff as well, now unlikely|pg||
nt|mdgraham: defence will get a spade ruff, but to no avail|pg||
nt|athene: no way to beat this - east could start with the spade lead but then if he tried underleading the club for a second ruff he would be sadly disappointed|pg||
nt|athene: i don't think you want to offer clubs with a minimum 5422|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|roswolf: indeed but east took a normal view i think|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you cant stand a 2D response and a huge chunk of your stuff is in their suit -- a defensive hand-type when they open 1S really|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Oh well, they are getting too many trump tricks now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We all agree re the double|pg||
nt|petergill: Nice play of heart to ten|pg||
nt|arno11: EW are Iris Grümm and Stefan Jerolitsch both in their late twenties, Iris is a steady competitor for the austrian ladies team and Stefan is a former junior internationalist|pg||
nt|arno11: I guess NS are of the same age, maybe even younger|pg||
nt|vugraphzqn: N-S 26,28...|pg||
nt|petergill: Is South Ben Handley-Pritchard? If so, he used to play in England Junior (U26) team about 8 years ago |pg||
nt|arno11: http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=3308   Iris|pg||
nt|vugraphzqn: yes scrote i Ben Handley_pritchard|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c7|nt|tomi2: As far as I remember this Consus squad won Australian Nationals earlier this year|pg||
nt|henryb:  At this vulnerability, I think you either have to look for slam or defend|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I agree- prospects of 6@C probably remote|pg||
nt|athene: and 5@C is very rarely going to be better than 3nt|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.pzbs.pl/wyniki/turnieje/2010/pula/team/pulateamleaderb.html  for running scores|pg||
nt|hedyg: now @D?|pg||
nt|petergill: A @d now, before any meaningful defensive discards, is recommended |pg||
nt|peachy: Your commentators are Mike Graham/England and Raija Davis/USA|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|lestergold: west did better to win the spade and lead one back as east cannot het in gain|pg||
nt|lestergold: now west needs to avoid being endplayed |pg||
nt|vugraphzqn: hii comentators...hii kibbs|pg||
pc|cK|nt|roswolf: but with 4 cards in the other major not too yucky|pg||
nt|marlowepi: both red is the worst conditions for this double -- both sides might go down in hundreds|pg||
nt|arno11: http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=13996 Stefan|pg||
nt|petergill: NS team name is "She Goes to Bed at 8pm"|pg||
pc|c8|nt|Walddk2: There is a first time for everything, all 4 commentators agree|pg||

nt|athene: if north actually had a diamond ruff coming, and four hearts, it might be sensible to show THREE hearts|pg||

nt|petergill: @d's at Trick 2|pg||
nt|petergill: Pula in Croatia is very popular, and this event has a very good reputation|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Bernard|pg||
mb|2H|an|!h + any|nt|peachy: suits aren splitting friendly in this hand|pg||
nt|athene: most people would open the north hand 1@S - 2@S is ok if that's what it shows|pg||
nt|othered1: that's a normal result, if east doesn't make the non-restricted choice decision had north played @SJ on second round.|pg||
nt|athene: well, people treat 6-4 as a 1-suiter, sometimes|pg||
nt|arno11: EW are using a kind of Blue Club system, so strong club  4 card majors and canapé (shorter suit first in some situations)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|athene: how loudly can east pass 1@S?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The East hand before could not be bid accurately after the 1@H response as 2@D woulkd be artificial. 2@C was in theory 6+ clubs and 15+ points, but he had to lie a little|pg||
nt|hedyg: tststs|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzqn: ...sry all..lost conection..:(|pg||
nt|roswolf: aggressive opening by north|pg||
nt|peachy: in light opening style, North will open|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@D showing diamonds, a rare bird on this side of the pond|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's as good as anything in my view|pg||
nt|petergill: I played Blue Club for about 2 months. |pg||
nt|arno11: EW are playing canapé style, but only by opener, strong club with control responses by step, kind of BLue CLub|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@C is 17+|pg||
nt|Walddk2: with control responses I assume|pg||
nt|arno11: as iti is still played in Austria but becoming less popular|pg||
nt|bernix: hi mike|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that will get NS to 4@S|pg||
mb|3H|nt|athene: if they bid 6@S (unlikely) west had better keep his fingers off that @DA|pg||
nt|fabsayc: EW probably make 6@D, but will they get there|pg||
nt|arno11: W will bid 1@H |pg||
nt|petergill: Ben H-P in his youth used not to like to pass against a strong 1@C |pg||
nt|petergill: Matej Ivancic is from Croatia and Ben Handley-Pritchard is from England|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Either 2@C  or 1NT   18-20 balanced|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I wonder....say West is on lead to 4@s and finds CK lead - defence take two clubs and a ruff.... |pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: not uncommon in England, maybe in places like Norway where they like Ekren |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Also after double?|pg||
nt|petergill: Still the same |pg||
nt|arno11: showing FG less than 3 controls (ace= 3 king=2)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You gain 2 steps after an overcall|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.pzbs.pl/wyniki/turnieje/2010/pula/team/pulateam2leaderb.html  for running scores|pg||
nt|hedyg: 10 tricks in NT, 11 in @D |pg||
nt|lestergold: i dont think e/w will but this in 2@h and more doesnt make|pg||
mb|3N|nt|henryb:  Must not have weak 2 available|pg||
nt|rv: 3rd seat pre-empt can be wide ranging for most partnerships|pg||
nt|athene: a very surprising pass from east - i would have thought it was simply a choice between double and 2@H (i woudl double)|pg||
nt|athene: if you play Lebensohl then 3@S is forcing (with an invitational hand south would bid 2nt then 3@S)|pg||
nt|arno11: 1@H is 11-16, 4+ cards can have 4 cards+ a longer suit that´s why alerted|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=3308  Iris Grümm, pretty young woman|pg||
nt|athene: it's always very tough, when one person has shortage in his partner's first-bid suit, to find out whether there are wasted values there|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so this is blue team ew then, arno?|pg||
nt|arno11: 2@D 9 cards in both directions so could be 4@H 5@D or the other way round|pg||
nt|Walddk2: pass and redouble|pg||
nt|arno11: also after dbl, XX wld show 5-7 with clubs|pg||
nt|lestergold: buy|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: South does not double because 1@C is artificial.|pg||
nt|roswolf: a weak 2 is very strong by today's standards|pg||
nt|marlowepi: double?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ah|pg||
nt|mdgraham: oops|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, thousands play Multi|pg||
nt|peachy: Or some polish versions, or Ekren's etc.|pg||
nt|athene: ouch|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, all you can say here is that South thought 3@S was forcing and North didn't|pg||
nt|vugraphzqn: I think some misunderstand here...S look angry...|pg||
nt|petergill: Dbl will be some sort of two suiter, perhaps hearts and a minor ( I guess) |pg||
nt|hedyg: i would have bid 3NT|pg||
nt|bernix: ns may not end up in their best fit though|pg||
nt|lestergold: almost certainly not|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West can then be squeezed in the red suits I think|pg||
mb|4S|nt|mdgraham: very disciplined pass over 1@s by East|pg||
nt|athene: i think north might have thought they didn't play lebenshl here|pg||
nt|athene: there is less reason for it after you double 2@D|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.pzbs.pl/wyniki/turnieje/2010/pula/team/pulateam2leaderb.html  for running scores|pg||
nt|athene: because mostly with a weak hand you are bidding 2major|pg||
nt|arno11: yes Martin at least as far as I know :)|pg||
nt|athene: now when west doesn't cue 4@H, that is music to east's ears|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Blue Club is only alive in Austria I think. Fischer-Saurer also play it, don't they?|pg||
nt|petergill: Astro or Aspro over the strong club|pg||
nt|petergill: On a non-club lead, I think 6@D can be made by picking spades then squeezing West|pg||
nt|hedyg: 5@C= control with @d fit|pg||
nt|petergill: but @CJ is the natural lead to 5@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: dont like the 1nt - i would double having both majors|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2NT may show good clubs |pg||
nt|lestergold: oh|pg||
nt|mdgraham: all academic, as East is on lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphpl2: ale klotni nie ma atmosfera dalej ok|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: i think a polish 1@C should be assumed to be natural-ish and defend accordingly|pg||
nt|athene: there's such a fine line between "disciplined" and "wet" :)|pg||
nt|athene: 2nt is just natural by the look of it|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes. You might not like 2@H, but double is possible|pg||
nt|peachy: If playing sound overcalls, E suit is not good enough.  Opposite passed partner, I think it is just conservative, not quite "wet"|pg||
nt|athene: south might just bid 3nt now anyway|pg||
nt|athene: those tens and nines are all quite nice|pg||
nt|mdgraham: wouldn't mind double|pg||
nt|athene: ok, maybe she doesn't like music :)|pg||
nt|peachy: small clubs will be an impossible lead to fing|pg||
nt|peachy: find*|pg||
pc|cA|nt|arno11: Fischer Saurer are playing 5 card majors and strong 1@C|pg||
nt|arno11: pass 0-4, 1@D 5-7|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3NT, of course, has nine top tricks - silly old South for bidding 4@s :) |pg||
pc|c2|nt|roswolf: dont understand east's pass over 4@S|pg||
nt|arno11: the austrian ladies pairs are mostly playing Blue Club, so anyone can play with anyone|pg||
nt|fabsayc: here the second/fourth lead tells declarer club finesse working|pg||
nt|vugraphzqn: 2/4 leads|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.pzbs.pl/wyniki/turnieje/2010/pula/team/pulateam2leaderb.html  for running scores|pg||
nt|athene: well, unless it's a singleton lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 96 teams were divided into 24 groups of 4. Three rounds of qualifying, and then Swiss|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is Swiss 3, last match today|pg||
nt|peachy: with such distributional hands, club could easily be singleton|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6 more tomorrow|pg||
nt|athene: the Poles lead differently from everyone else from most suit combinations, but they have to follow the rest of the world with a singleton :)|pg||
nt|arno11: forgot Fucik and Purkarthofer and wife and husband Terraneo (Franz + Sylvia) who played Blue-Club for Austria in Ostend|pg||
nt|petergill: EW are lucky that they aren't overboard. |pg||
nt|petergill: Dble of 4@H would have yielded - let me add it up on a trump lead |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Did you say Ace = 3    king = 2   Arno?   In that case they are not playing "normal" responses, zz  as played by Nyström-Bertheau rather where ace = 3   king = 2   queen = 1     zz|pg||
nt|petergill: This will be interesting!|pg||
nt|petergill: @CJ lead = defence is doing OK, @SA lead = no good|pg||
nt|lestergold: Ben has judged this well to 'rescue' pard|pg||
nt|bernix: i admit i would have passed|pg||
nt|lestergold: and now north best pass|pg||
pc|c9|nt|brolucius: Yes.|pg||
nt|rv: not sure if X meant anything specific, possibly East felt he had unstated strength|pg||
nt|petergill: no good|pg||
nt|hedyg: how he can make it|pg||
nt|lestergold: Ben knows that pard is not too strong didnt overcall immediately|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|peachy: West's choices for opening lead, difficult|pg||
nt|athene: no way to beat this - declarer will just plot away at the clubs|pg||
nt|athene: *plod away|pg||
nt|fabsayc: do they lead singleton?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and all interest departs|pg||
pc|c8|nt|tomi2: dont know what systems they use, but Martnes is fan of a system with very weak openings w/r and strong club while vulnerable he prefers to play natural openings|pg||
nt|athene: with @HAK @CAK off the hand declarer knows he needs a certain amount of good fortune, but it's all forthcoming|pg||
nt|Walddk2: With the left hand. Nice gadget|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Don't you all do that?|pg||
nt|arno11: dbl wld have netted 800|pg||
nt|arno11: sry ace 2 king 1 |pg||
nt|Walddk2: ok then|pg||
nt|petergill: -5 would be 1100 but I think declarer might have escaped for only 800 in 4@HX|pg||
nt|petergill: Ben Handley - Pritchard was recently the npc of the Croatian Ladies team at Ostend in the Euro Championships |pg||
nt|lestergold: so tricially defeated in 3@h|pg||
pc|c3|nt|petergill: and he will make it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am glad to see that an unsupported ace is a disaster|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It takes TWO tricks to beat a slam|pg||
pc|cK|nt|vugraphpl2: gosia miala obawy ze singlowa wziela|pg||

nt|arno11: http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=3308    Iris Grümm|pg||

nt|athene: using the clubs as entry to dummy|pg||
nt|arno11: http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=13996    and her partner :)|pg||
nt|athene: playing the @CJ at trick 1 might have been a deceptive move in case the lead was a singleton - south might not be able to read it|pg||
nt|athene: but it does mean you can't get two club entries to dummy|pg||
nt|athene: if north is sufficiently well-read to insert the king on the @C5 lead|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Finishing late tonight European time|pg||
nt|arno11: how big will group A be in the end?|pg||
pc|s6|nt|brolucius: North-South have sold out too cheaply, really. They have half the points and a 4-4 spade fit.|pg||
nt|jbgood: a steal for sure|pg||
nt|rv: not best defense|pg||
pc|s3|nt|Walddk2: Maybe Tomislav knows|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|athene: if the defence had attacked hearts right from the start they would be threatening to set up east's long heart before declarer got the clubs going, but south could change plans and ...|pg||
nt|athene: go for the diamonds and spades - with both finesses working he would have nine tricks without any clubs|pg||
nt|arno11: now 28 teams, but will be less in the end|pg||
pc|sA|nt|petergill: One reason that people bid a lot nowadays is that opponents often do not take the penalties on offer - with a fairly balanced hand (i.e. no singleton nor void), West might have ...|pg||
nt|petergill: doubled 4@H|pg||
pc|d5|nt|tomi2: this hand seems to be the reason.|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh dear|pg||
nt|bernix: not so trivial to defeat 3@h|pg||
pc|s9|nt|petergill: On a red suit lead, declarer runs @SJ, and when East wins @SA, a club back to break up the impending black-suit squeeze seems to be necessary |pg||
nt|lestergold: why no spade ruff i dont understand|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|s5|nt|athene: but with a solid 5-5 trump fit you aren't usually all that worried about entries|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The last 3 rounds will be Danish where two teams can meet more than once|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mdgraham: After the 2@h opening, North may find this squeeze - let's see|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|vugraphpl2: gajcyk wypytuje o sekwencje zrzutek|pg||

nt|peachy: while he is  thinking:   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Istria.png  Pula is located by the beautiful Adriatic Sea|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this is the sort of hand the opposition always make aganst you - off course you go about two off|pg||
nt|athene: there are some layouts where it would be wrong but nothing like as many|pg||
pc|c5|nt|roswolf: yes that is why double was better - the flexible friend|pg||
pc|c6|nt|jbgood: they would have to fight over 3 clubs then - not easy|pg||
nt|blum1956: hi all|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|athene: ok, perhaps declarer decided that west would not lead from @SQxxx - so he either has five, or he doesn't have the queen|pg||
