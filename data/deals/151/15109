pc|d4|pc|s7|pg||
pc|sT|pc|d6|nt|h_karluk: i got it, they like slams in competitive auctions, see they did not bother much by their opps|pg||
mc|12|nt|lestergold: obviously slams only on when oppos push u there i understand|pg||
nt|h_karluk: agreed|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Inviting strong 2@s opening had made it easy to bid 6@s|pg||
nt|lestergold: north has a monster and knows is odds on on the heart bid to be playing with a 30 point pack to boot pard dint bid no trumps he jumped inspades|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Ed's point really cool, he questioned "might that missed slam have been a fast arrival misunderstanding?"|pg||
nt|lestergold: what about 5@s how good are ur spade honours?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But I donÂ´t understand 3@h instead of a natural 3@c bid from N|pg||
nt|lestergold: i do not disagree with the 1 @s opening the suit is poor in quality for some kind of strength ashowing opener|pg||
nt|lestergold: however after p[artner has responded pretty positively i want to show i have extras and even more than extras|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4 boards to go|pg||
nt|Walddk2: One more session of IMP Pairs tomorrow afternoon, then on to the individual|pg||
nt|h_karluk: emergency here guys, appreciated all around, have fun please, so long|pg||
nt|lestergold: slam bidding is usually the weak link in many expert partnerships|pg||
nt|lestergold: we dont get a penny|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry private message|pg||
nt|lestergold: but not private information |pg||
nt|vugraphzrn: play will resume in 2 mins.|pg||
nt|lestergold: all commentators are volunteers of course do it for love of game and desire to make bridge as accessib le as possible for players of all standards|pg||
nt|lestergold: bbo vugraph is in my view the greatest boost to the game of bridge ever|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree mike:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: and the game needs  efforts to keep it growing and interesting young people|pg||
nt|lestergold: many of the commentators are elderly folk with very young minds|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: north has opened the bidding where his major assets are in  hearts he must raise hearts on every possible ground when pard responds its simply p[oor bridge to pass 1h|pg||
