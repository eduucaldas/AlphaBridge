nt|haans: was 3@D really passable?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You saw it was|pg||
nt|haans: true|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: too many 24 hcp at combined hands|pg||

nt|Walddk2: The layout isn't friendly for 4@S so it will probably go down|pg||
nt|haans: really good double|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ancient greek philosopher Aristotle discovered there's agreement with tragedy in his epic poetry studies|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Spades 4-1, club honours offside. Altshuler let them know when he doubled|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|d3|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 3 pass own, 4 pass of partner and a double with 8 hcp&stiff trump, we say 'i doubled their auction' in Turkiye|pg||
nt|haans: assume @D9 do not tell how many @D he has|pg||
nt|vugraphzrn: lost the play,  sorry - ended 1 down|pg||
mc|9|nt|haans: thats was entertaining|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He is only 1 down despite the bad breaks so it's perfectly fine to be in this game|pg||
nt|h_karluk: what if N has doubleton @c and West had stiff @c? there's no guarantee N would have 4 pcs @s also|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think double with off two at own hand better|pg||
nt|Walddk2: End of round 1|pg||
