nt|haans: Only strong players in this tournament|pg||
nt|sommer: hi all|pg||
nt|pef: This is a set of 11 boards in the Buffett Cup.  This is the pair competition, where the two pairs at this table are|pg||
nt|haans: Hi Povi|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|pef: compared against two pairs in the closed room.  Scoring is board a match and winner take all in the match|pg||
mb|2C!|an|Majors|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pef: Allan Sontag and David Berkowitz are the American pair|pg||
nt|pef: and Jason and Justin Hackett are the European pair|pg||
mb|p|nt|sommer: risky decission by Jason here|pg||
nt|haans: playing 2@C may be costly|pg||
pc|d6|nt|sommer: ...wonder why, he didnt chose 2@H|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dK|pc|d4|pg||
nt|haans: often you bid 2@C with 5-4 4-4 in M|pg||
nt|pef: it looks like down about 3, which is likely to cost the board.  passing with k10x of hearts seems like a pretty swingy decision to me|pg||
nt|sommer: looks like kiss of death|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|d2|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|s6|nt|pef: the counterpart teammates are Steve Weinstein and Bobby Levin for the Americans, and Sabine Auken/Daniela van Armin for the Europeans|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
nt|haans: ahh the teams change after every match?|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s7|pc|s5|pc|s4|pg||
nt|sommer: in BAM, you dont bid tough games or slams - same as in pairs|pg||
nt|pef: yes, different "teams" every match.  Actually three types of matches--pairs, which we are seeing now, teams, which are like a normal team match but played bam and individual|pg||
nt|haans: but in Bridge you bid all games and some more :)|pg||
nt|sommer: all that matters is, that you have 10 points more than the oponents|pg||
nt|pef: or in the case of Meckwell, 5 more :)|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||

nt|mamos: is this a  hand for science?|pg||

nt|stc: and a making line if E have had one more @h instead of the @d|pg||
mb|4H|nt|mamos: :)   a two up transfer :)|pg||
nt|reisig: Pass is a sure thing|pg||
nt|oliverc: Auken perhaps not counting the hand right there. partner HAS to have either the K|pg||
nt|oliverc: or J of Spades to make up their 1@C Opening|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: normally many people plays it xfer to spades|pg||
nt|stc: this is how you win 100 times the cavendish|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: as Bob read it|pg||
nt|mamos: not necessarily Hamdi  may be cue|pg||
nt|h_karluk: if Bob would open 1N then things would be easy, ie uncontested 1N>3@h mild slam invite for clubs|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that'|pg||
nt|h_karluk: s also true Mike|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so there's not a novel layout problem, but the matter is to tell yr clubs to partner|pg||
nt|mamos: if you play $C@C for @H and @d for @S  makes sense to play the other way round too|pg||
nt|h_karluk: sure, you know it all depends partnership agreements|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and you are not sure about @c A, K|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: http://www.masterpointpress.com/general/bbum.html|pg||
pc|c3|nt|h_karluk: if you roll the dice and bid slam then in the newspapers, if goes down would feel worst, because the players there know their business very well|pg||
nt|oliverc: hi everyone|pg||
nt|mamos: well  you'd want to be playing with a partner with whom you had very secure agreements on this auction ........|pg||
nt|h_karluk: I don't think anyone has the luxury to take an adventure |pg||
nt|h_karluk: still 6NT, presumably very hard to lead a @d from KJx ternace|pg||
nt|h_karluk: in case 5@s misread|pg||
nt|oliverc: Do we know exactly what 4@H meant?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: edit : tenace|pg||
nt|h_karluk: no we do not know|pg||

nt|vugraphzrj: 2@D shows 9 cards either way|pg||
nt|mamos: lots of bidding on a 20-20 hand|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: surprised they didnt double 4@D (at this form of scoring).|pg||
nt|h_karluk: pass saves the day|pg||
nt|h_karluk: drums beating|pg||
nt|vugraphzrj: not the fastest auction in the world|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dK|nt|h_karluk: this could be a breakpoint, in case @dJ lead|pg||

nt|oliverc: -1 now|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mamos: but Bob clearly did not|pg||
nt|h_karluk: which in practice as i said very very hard to lead from that KJ9 tenace to set it|pg||
nt|oliverc: indeed|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i believe they were not reading the same book (Bob&Zia)|pg||
nt|oliverc: so ruffing high and exiting with the Q@S should have been a sensible line of defence|pg||
pc|s6|nt|mamos: or perhaps he did and risked 6NT   not inconceivable at this form of scoring|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ok declarer claims|pg||
