pc|h5|pg||
nt|sharkey: will try ro confirm this|pg||
nt|petergill: Yes, B does play against E, so Antonio Sementa's overtrick won the board for Europe ---> 1-0 to Europe, with a long way to go. |pg||

mb|r|nt|sharkey: belive so Thomas - I just dont know how to do it....|pg||
nt|tomi2: how high will Berkowitz preempt r/w?|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@H now, or 2@H preemptive?|pg||
nt|tomi2: 2 would be finde for me|pg||
mb|3H|nt|viren169: at red,,, 1 is enough|pg||
nt|petergill: Tom, you're young, I thought you might try 3@H|pg||
nt|tomi2: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: players choosing to not have screens here|pg||
nt|sharkey: 7@D off 7 - 1700 I think|pg||
nt|sharkey: sry 7@H|pg||
nt|tomi2: but I already know how much doubled undertricks cost vulnerable|pg||
nt|petergill: Having partnered Larry Cohen for amyn years, Dave Berkowitz likes to bid to the max, law of total tricks style |pg||
nt|sharkey: 7@C may be less|pg||
nt|petergill: After the Redouble, both 2@H and 3@H are generally played as preemptive|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|viren169: yes but at this vul... sometimes opps dont have slam on and u go for telephone number!|pg||
nt|sharkey: 6@D at the other table - EW didnt interfere|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|mb|6D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: and partner's double indicated at least 3 cards in an unbid major, hence 3@H on the "9 trumps = 3 level" Law of Total Tricks theory|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cA|nt|sharkey: thought prehaps at BAM that one of the tables wud try 6 NT|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d8|pc|dA|pc|d6|pg||
pc|h4|nt|petergill: This will make without any problem, but the best line of play to make certain of 6@D is not clear|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hA|pc|hT|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c3|pc|d4|pc|c2|pg||
nt|viren169: run the Q on the bidding looks ok|pg||
nt|petergill: On a club lead, 6NT makes on a black suit squeeze, preferably ducking the first trick |pg||
mc|12|nt|petergill: Declarer is stripping out the other suits prior to playing spades|pg||
nt|sharkey: @S towards 10 works as well|pg||
pg||
qx|o4|st||md|2SK862HJ9832D84CKQ,ST973HT5DAT953C72,S5HAK76DQJ72C9643,SAQJ4HQ4DK6CAJT85|sv|b|nt|sharkey: in 6@D|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: Or strip other suits, @SQ - K - A, back to South hand, spade to ten - if @SJ is doubleton in East, you get a ruff and discard|pg||
nt|viren169: 1@C or 1N on East's hand?|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|tomi2: this looks like a strong club auction now|pg||
nt|viren169: looks like the safe and obvious 1C|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|sharkey: As we see a @S contract works better here|pg||
pc|h3|nt|petergill: Benito Garozzzo once said that he thinks Sementa may be the best card player in the world, so his line of play would have been the best one|pg||
nt|tomi2: but 1@D was not alerted 2 boards ago, so I wasn't sure|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hK|pc|h4|pg||
nt|sharkey: May end up at same in other room after 1 NT opening|pg||
pc|c6|nt|petergill: Bd 3 is flat - 920 at both tables in Table B versus Table E|pg||
nt|sharkey: Im not the one to dispute what Benito said....|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@C strong, Precision style, 1@D negative, 1NT = a strong 1NT|pg||
nt|sharkey: If Sontag can read @C6 as 2nd high he may spurn the double finesse|pg||
nt|tomi2: Berkowitz playing himself|pg||
nt|petergill: Also there is an inference that North, thinking the hearts can wait, has nothing in clubs to be leading clubs through declarer early|pg||
nt|viren169: opportunities for both sides on the @C switch.|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|pc|c2|pg||
nt|sharkey: EW in 3@S other room as N entered the bidding after East's 1 NT rebid|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c7|pc|c3|pc|cA|pg||
nt|sharkey: This is BAM scoring - the board is either Won, Lost or Tied|pg||

nt|petergill: hearts since South can unblock on the 2nd heart and leave North on play if South wants to|pg||

nt|viren169: I cant see much to upgrade in Noth's hand...|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: Bd 7: A club partscore might score 130 or might score 110, so 120 could be good or bad - or normal if the other table is in NT|pg||

mb|d|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|viren169: until it was passed!|pg||

nt|vugraphzre: pass explained as 0-5|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d7|pc|d5|pc|d6|pg||
nt|petergill: Dave Berkowitz's Dbl of 2@D either means "take-out" or "I wish you had have passed out 2@C" :)|pg||
nt|viren169: Duboin plaing in 2@C would have been interesting|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: lots of heads in hands here|pg||
nt|viren169: must have been a good dinner last night!|pg||
nt|sharkey: Appears 2@S superior to 2@H due to suit breaks|pg||
nt|petergill: The obvious top club lead would send 2@C down four, I think|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c2|pc|c9|pc|cJ|pg||

nt|viren169: Not sure what declarer is trying to do?!?!|pg||
nt|sharkey: we know @S are 3-3 - Sontag doesn't.....|pg||
nt|petergill: Perhaps Sementa forgot to read my expanation of what 2@C meant? In Italy, they probably play against a Strong 1@C so rarely that they have not prepared properly. Or (more likely) ...|pg||
nt|petergill: Sementa had a bidding "forget", not for the first time in his life. |pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hA|pc|h7|pc|h2|pg||
nt|viren169: even so... spade or a diamond looked right...|pg||

nt|tomi2: if ops have game he can go down 8 in 2@C for 400 or ensure -350 with -7|pg||
