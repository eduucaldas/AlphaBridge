mb|p|mb|p|nt|sharkey: All suits are breaking nicely - shud make|pg||
nt|athene: a bit of an ugly auction|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Waterlow had no other option if 1NT is forcing|pg||
nt|athene: even if 1nt is only semi-forcing, you wouldn't want to pass with that nice 14 count north hand|pg||
nt|athene: so basically you are in trouble - only flannery can save you!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: At least he showed the 5th heart|pg||

pc|sK|pc|s4|pc|c4|pg||

nt|daman: this looks like a 4@H game for EW|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|ady: good morning all|pg||
nt|lestergold: welcome specs to the first of todays encounters|pg||
nt|daman: soft board to start off|pg||

mb|3C!|nt|Walddk4: Hi Shirley|pg||
nt|Walddk4: E-W are Crouch-Patterson and I have their somewhat complicated system in front of me|pg||
nt|sybarra: Roland and Geoffrey |pg||
nt|Walddk4: We may need it|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: 2@D = SPADES AND ANOTHER I THINK|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Crouch is pitiful on BBO and one of our regular commentators|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1NT is 14-16 in 1st and 2nd|pg||
nt|ady: good morning Kath   David|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hello from Manchester|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: Hi all. Welcome to Solihull|pg||
nt|ady: not much difficulty   especially on likely heart lead|pg||
nt|yo_yo: we saw Townsend & Bakhshi put up a great performance this time yesterday|pg||
nt|daman: Italians always double with hands like East   points before shape|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Good evening all|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|daman: I would have passed|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|Walddk4: 15-17 in 3rd and 4th|pg||

nt|daman: I like lasagna    does that count?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: now S can take 11 tricks|pg||
pc|d6|nt|garnetts: Good morning everyone |pg||
nt|roswolf: yes lots of transfer responses on a strong club base|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3nt has perhaps a chance, but not 4@s|pg||
nt|lestergold: Good afternoon|pg||
nt|lestergold: Hi George|pg||
nt|daman: Hi Mike|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|pg||
nt|yo_yo: anyone know the results?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: did they keep it up?|pg||
nt|lestergold: all strong players here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Results from round 1: Rosen v Senior 25-4 ; Teltscher v P Hackett 19-11 ; Small v Hinden 17-13, and de Botton v Crouch 16-14|pg||
nt|yo_yo: david are there any results online?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Division 2: FEGARTY beat ROBERTS 25-5; PRYOR beat BIRD 25-5; COOPER beat SHILLITOE 23-7; DHONDY beat COPE 18-11 (Cope was penalised 1 VP for slow play)|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: Players seem very chipper for such an early hour|pg||
pc|hK|nt|garnetts: I agree Roland but with AQ stiff it is a reasonable bid as long as it cannot be passed |pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s play a standard 5 card major system i think - relatively uncommom in acol land|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h7|nt|yo_yo: good morning from Manchester|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hello from Manchester|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @h are 3-3 and a @s discard. @d are 3-3 and also a finess after the lead|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|ralfwil: this lead can help declarer|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You got the results before you asked, Kath|pg||
nt|yo_yo: that's very impressive yes :)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mcarroll: another double fit in the Majors|pg||
nt|garnetts: West doing a lot of bidding |pg||
nt|yo_yo: hello again ralf :)|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hA|nt|daman: can make 6 now|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|lestergold: predictable lead which stes up 3 heart tricks for declarer|pg||
nt|lestergold: curse the cards!|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|Walddk2: Sandqvist - McIntosh are members of the England open team, and Crouch-Patterson have won the Camrose Trophy for England|pg||
nt|roswolf: both very good pairs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Sandqcist originally from Sweden, Tosh from Scotland|pg||
nt|sybarra: defense has to be a bit careful here|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|haans: spade loser soon|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Division 1 after 20 boards: Teltscher +19 IMPs v Rosen, Senior +7 IMPs v Small, Crouch +8 IMPs v Hinden, Hackett P +3 IMPs v DeBotton|pg||
pc|d4|pc|h8|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Michelle must have been having kittens with that awful south hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: cashing out|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/w could be candidates for one of the strongest mixed pairs on the planet|pg||
nt|daman: that's a pretty broad statement|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Division 2: Cooper +36 v Dhondy, Cope +27 v Pryor, Roberts +19 v Bird, Fegarty +1 v Shillitoe|pg||
pc|c3|nt|daman: I have to say I don't agree|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sybarra: wisely |pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|garnetts: yes easier to play the ace and finesse |pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: but he sin't  doing that |pg||
nt|garnetts: Must admit I cannot see much wrong with 1@H and if I had managed to bid 2@H --then 3@D wouldn't have been on my mind |pg||
nt|yo_yo: 2@H would be a 6 card suit with me|pg||
nt|blum1956: hi all|pg||
nt|ady: hi|pg||
nt|garnetts: In the balancing position here 2@H should be say a decent six card suit and a reasonable hand --what used to be called intermediate |pg||
pc|d9|pc|dT|nt|roswolf: the ace of clubs wont run away|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ralfwil: 9 tricks with a correct play in @c|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sybarra: yes it will |pg||
pc|s6|nt|sybarra: 10 9 of spades and the good @D?|pg||
nt|roswolf: oh yes|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 4@c, 2@h, 2@s and 1@d = 9|pg||
pc|s2|nt|roswolf: oops|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Ed Shapiro|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and hello Ralf|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Hello Roland and Ed|pg||
nt|Walddk4: also welcome to our operator, Nicky|pg||
mc|11|nt|Walddk2: This line is scary. It's not a good idea to shorten the long hand when you also have fit in a side suit|pg||
nt|garnetts: West should hold his cards up lol  |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nothing bad will happen here, but on a different layout ....|pg||
nt|haans: tme for a clubs ruff|pg||
nt|haans: time|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes  has to make 4@C tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: a 'double dummy' @d lead would probably be only lead to put declarer undr serious pressure here|pg||
nt|ady: may only make 9 obvious tricks|pg||
pg||

nt|Walddk2: 4@H is a slam killer|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|Walddk2: They don't have one, but ...|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c3|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h5|nt|athene: well, south has a million key cards and slam still isn't there, so 4@H isn't that bad, maybe|pg||

nt|Walddk2: So give him @SK instead of @HQ. Would he have moved?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|Walddk2: No, because he has no diamond control|pg||
nt|athene: no, but that doesn't make 4@H a bad bid|pg||
mc|11|nt|sharkey: With the 5th @H and @DK well placed I disagree Bill|pg||

nt|yo_yo: has he forsaken tom townsend?|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes i haD NOTICED EVEN THO AT THIS HOUR IM NORMALLY HAL;F ASLEEP|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry capslock|pg||
nt|ady: 3@D    3NT   likely staert|pg||
nt|lestergold: Hallberg of course a legend and Ms.Senior one of the world's leading lady players|pg||
nt|lestergold: against the long standing partnerhsip of cooke and garvey|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, everyone, from rainy central Pennsylvania, USA.|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: My second session - will try harder|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|roswolf: a blow for de botton|pg||
nt|daman: I have never heard of the legend and I subscribed to IPBM for years|pg||
mb|1D|nt|lestergold: er yes basically altho they still paly in some things|pg||
mb|1H|nt|roswolf: 2@C - THE MAJORS|pg||
nt|ralfwil: remaining @s from dummy and S is squeezed|pg||
nt|yo_yo: if 1NT is 15-18 why the delay?|pg||
nt|ady: not likely to make|pg||
nt|lestergold: Garvey a great bit slightly wild talent|pg||
nt|daman: I have heard of Nevena|pg||
mb|p|mb|2D|nt|mcarroll: "Interesting" a very broad term  |pg||
nt|yo_yo: i hope tony forrester doesnt shout at your son|pg||
nt|lestergold: Hallberg is a world class player|pg||
nt|daman: you said legend    he is not a legend|pg||
nt|daman: and I have a plethora of specs who agree|pg||
nt|lestergold: well a matter of opinion |pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: taking advantage of the vul|pg||
nt|sybarra: might end the 4/3 with X or 3 nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 2@H|pg||
nt|ady: Brunner not opening vul with a ragged suit|pg||
nt|yo_yo: who is East,  Bakhshi is in both rooms|pg||
nt|lestergold: n/sneeed to bid this tight vul 3N whoch as cards lie should make|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 2@C probably stayman|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I doubt N can make 3nt after a @s lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: Small max will accept the invite which is on the way|pg||
nt|daman: he might be a legend in GB|pg||
mb|4H|nt|garnetts: Not sure if NS use a 12-14 1NT --but even so I think this hand needs upgrading --too good for 15-17|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good morning to Ed Shapiro|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, everyone!|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi ED|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello Ed |pg||

mb|p|nt|ady: fantastic pass from West    winning action|pg||

nt|othered1: Anyone make sense of this auction?|pg||
pc|d6|nt|daman: Sure I have|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ralfwil: and for me a @s lead is natural as E|pg||
nt|lestergold: i c defence can establish 2 spades 2 clubs and a heart |pg||
nt|daman: sctoll up|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sybarra: should roll this one home,  not sure E can ever get in   |pg||
nt|roswolf: thyis looks like a make - west will be embarassed on the run of the minors|pg||

nt|Walddk4: But you said you had not|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|haans: bidding today make them go to 3 level|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Strange lead|pg||
nt|garnetts: Likely think that it is too balanced and the suit is too weak at red|pg||
nt|sybarra: and clubs are 3/3 |pg||
nt|lestergold: am i seeing things here|pg||
nt|daman: scroll up|pg||
nt|Walddk4: oh, heard, sorry|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|pelu: hi all|pg||

pc|d2|pc|d5|pg||

nt|daman: hrrrrrmmmmm|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mcarroll: Hi Peter|pg||
nt|lestergold: Townsend chos the  right time to pass but i would have thought an action with his big hand was noprmal like 3N|pg||
pc|h5|nt|garnetts: but it works well |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Call me naive, but I would have led a spade|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|blum1956: no way to go down in 4@s (almost)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: @C lead in other room|pg||
nt|ady: Q@C well place this will get home   also diamonds 4-4   |pg||
nt|garnetts: I think both NS judged well --one to pass as South and the other to upgrade the North hand---but the final decision to stay in 3NT is a poot one--South gave North a choice and 4@S ...|pg||
nt|garnetts: should have been bid |pg||
nt|yo_yo: easy make on  @C lead|pg||
nt|blum1956: Today more and more players open weak two with 6-card whatever quality one is|pg||
nt|blum1956: 6-card or player ))))|pg||
nt|garnetts: They do--and in my view their card play rarely live up to their expectations--a triumph of hope over experience |pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|othered1: Might there have been a pass by east to start this?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: lost it N|pg||

nt|athene: looks like a no-brainer takeout double from north?|pg||
nt|sharkey: Some may not have entered the fray with West's card VUL|pg||
nt|athene: 2@D might be some cunning bid, like diamonds and a major, or something?|pg||
mb|3N|an|No Stop|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: north doesn't bother with a possible spade fit|pg||

pc|dK|nt|haans: had myself bid 4@C |pg||

nt|garnetts: I like 4@C as it helps partner to judge --but usually is shows more length doesn't it?  |pg||
nt|roswolf: Q in pards bid suit i think|pg||

nt|lestergold: has to be careful when returning to hand ruffing the third@d|pg||
nt|lestergold: however has no choice as @da drops|pg||
nt|pelu: on @DK he can discard the last @S-loser - so give up 2 @Hs - but has to take @HA|pg||
pc|h5|nt|garnetts: 4@S is very poorly disciplined |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Excellent judgement by Gui. 4@S is as dead as a dead chruch rat|pg||
nt|Walddk2: church  even|pg||
nt|garnetts: ask partner for a view and then ignore it--this hsould be a slam try sequence |pg||
nt|mcarroll: interesting metaphor|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Even if you guess hearts (you don't), it's 1 down|pg||

pc|s3|pc|sT|nt|lestergold: in the other room teammates de botton and malinowski the latter a world class player de botton a world class sponsor and enthusiast of the game|pg||
pc|sA|pc|d5|pg||

nt|ady: good swing for Hackett|pg||

nt|Walddk2: ah, ok|pg||
nt|roswolf: ah my faith in tosh is restored |pg||
pc|c3|pc|cJ|nt|garnetts: A heart to the King and North will do well to duck |pg||

nt|ralfwil: this was a mistake as I see it - for 9 tricks|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cT|nt|lestergold: Holland and Brunner partnership in real life Holland a fin player used to partner the late Arnstrong qell respected player |pg||

mb|1H|nt|athene: yes, ducking the @H10 would give the defence three hearts and @DAK for sure|pg||
mb|d|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: 4-4-4-1 with singleton spade is notoriously tricky hand|pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|nt|athene: Malinowski has no such compunctions|pg||

nt|athene: do you play for @CQxx onside and an endplay?|pg||
nt|athene: not likely to work as the defence should have communication in diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: the requirements for double-then-bid have gone up over the years - many people would simply overcall a spade with that north hand|pg||
nt|sharkey: Yes - especially Vul|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d9|pc|dJ|nt|athene: interesting stuff :)|pg||
pc|dA|pg||

nt|athene: several kibitzers are questioning east's play in diamonds - certainly in many similar situations you want to try to grab the lead to play partner's suit back through declarer|pg||

nt|lestergold: Small is having a field day at the wheel|pg||
nt|yo_yo: mind you a weak 2 would have worked equally well |pg||
nt|lestergold: of course its no0t a victory for the multi as such merely a victory for the barrage that took place|pg||
nt|lestergold: or maybe a lowly trump promoted in south |pg||
nt|daman: 3NT for EW? |pg||
nt|daman: being aggressive?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Michelle Brunner a frequent member of English distaff international team|pg||
nt|lestergold: Waterlow usually plays with hackett senior very experienced senior player i dont know much about Levy|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: SZ thinking about digging graves|pg||
nt|ady: part score here    likley 1NT e/w|pg||

nt|lestergold: which hand? the last?|pg||

nt|marlowepi: is this david levy?|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 5@H!? What a strange choice|pg||
nt|mcarroll: This mountain that SZ had to climb is suddenly taking on the appearance of Everest|pg||
nt|garnetts: Cannot think how West declared 5@H next door |pg||
nt|garnetts: I suppose that with the TOD west thought east had four |pg||
nt|daman: I think you might look at their card Nicky|pg||
mb|1N|mb|d|an|Alert|nt|Walddk2: This is funny. Yang psyched a pass over the Multi|pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 1,  e/w lost an imp here|pg||

nt|daman: ask them the result|pg||
mb|r|nt|haans: agressive non bidding|pg||
nt|garnetts: No auction given in the movie|pg||
mb|2D|nt|blum1956: again the 3NT-4 Major choice|pg||
nt|othered1: Why alert the double,  Standard to double 1N for takout of @S|pg||
mb|d|nt|ady: diamond lead beats this|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: 4@h is better than 4@s. time enough to find the @c ruff|pg||
nt|lestergold: so the rosen team fresh from having given the senior team a serious pasting|pg||
nt|ady: wrong red suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: ht lead i predict|pg||
nt|daman: would we all have bid 3NT with 3334 9 count?|pg||
nt|daman: I have been told that -1 was claimed at the table|pg||
nt|lestergold: Hallberg still has his workl cut out for 9 tricks|pg||
nt|daman: from someone who is at the table|pg||
nt|lestergold: there are two tens i think normal to bid vul game at ips with west's hand|pg||
nt|othered1: North can't really sit this,  since his double wasn't based on defense|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i was wondering about the alert on Michelle's pass over 1C last time. maybe she alerts all her bids|pg||
nt|othered1: his redouble, rather|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i am not sure he cant sit this. he has good defence, knows he is facing spade shortness and five hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: maybe she was swayed by her two 10's|pg||
mb|2H|mb|d|nt|roswolf: yes a spade lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: from the frying pan.... into ,,,, the fire....|pg||
nt|othered1: The double, in practice, tends to deny a fit at all, but north's @S suit doesn't need a lot of support.  |pg||
mb|2S|nt|yo_yo: bakhshi has to alert  as he could have a longer @D suit|pg||
nt|ady: may get to 4@H    needs club lead  to definately beat it|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 4@H also made in the other room on board 1, with an overtrick even|pg||
nt|othered1: Not at all -- isn't 2@H makable?|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: this might beat it too|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: SZ scores :)|pg||
nt|pelu: I exp that the bidding in CR is so strange, that the operator dont wont to give it :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he has two trumps and above all, EW are vul & 2D X is not game so even if they make it there is a limit to how bad it can be. N has shown a good hand so if S doesnt want to move ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: towards game I think it is reasonable for N to pass the double|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes! 2@h is not so far away|pg||
nt|lestergold: but hm as i expected Sandqvist is worried about the defensive potential of his con tribution|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|nt|lestergold: @d switch good enuf?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: the teltscher team seemed to be way in front  yesterday|pg||
pc|d6|nt|yo_yo: this will be a quick match|pg||
nt|lestergold: Halberg will make it with the help from the lead now|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|lestergold: has time to try the club as well|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ady: spade lead also enough    only one discard of a club  so down 1|pg||
pc|d4|nt|Walddk2: A spade was led to the ace and one returned. Curtains|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dT|pg||
nt|daman: he almost has to fall into it now    no?|pg||
pc|d9|nt|sybarra: was so much easier to beat the hand from this vantage point |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|Walddk2: I am told that the contract was 6@C and not 5@H|pg||
pc|dA|nt|roswolf: but after the great lead the follow-up was disappointing|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In the open room, Whittaker reasonably played partner for a singleton spade rather than @CA after West bid game|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Can't fault him|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Anyway, something went 2 down|pg||
nt|othered1: I think 2@S was a good decision, likely going plus instead of minus if east had taken the right view|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|pc|s4|pc|s9|pg||
nt|garnetts: I am suprised to hear that :)  |pg||
pc|sK|pc|s3|nt|Walddk2: Whittaker also from Scotland originally|pg||
nt|othered1: and 670 is an especially ugly minus|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h9|pg||
nt|yo_yo: making now|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But EW can still defeat 4@h with @d continustion|pg||
nt|ralfwil: continuation....|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2@h hasa fair potential as cards lie|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it is different to pass the doubl;e of 2H. first off, if they make it NS will have a huge loss, and secondly N has a much better hand for defense against Ds than Hs. as against ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that, S probably has five hearts. here prudence wins the day|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h5|nt|daman: he will take the money and run|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|lestergold: north was never stabding a double into game at the 2 level|pg||
pc|c3|nt|Walddk2: Scotland "exported" many strong players, most notably Michael Rosenberg and Barnet Shenkin to USA|pg||
pc|cA|nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and Victor Silverstone, Irving Gordon, and a few others|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: Was 1 off, not making|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No wonder Scotland does not have a strong team today|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c2|pg||
nt|haans: close to making|pg||
nt|lestergold: his redouble was bad on offensive potential of course|pg||
nt|lestergold: based not bad|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cT|pc|cK|pc|c8|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and even if 2H would fail, it probably wouldnt go down more than one, so as long as N thinks he has a good shot at 110, the IMP odds support bidding. the real question is can he ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: count on going plus, knowing there is a big spade stack behind him. i think so, because he will be able to make his small trumps via ruffs as long as S has entries|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hA|nt|yo_yo: unfortunate discard by East|pg||
pc|s8|pc|h7|pg||
pc|c6|nt|garnetts: This seems to go in line with the old adage --return partner's suit |pg||
pc|hT|nt|blum1956: NS needed to ruff a spade before switching to clubs|pg||
nt|garnetts: The Q@C seems a very flash play to me |pg||

nt|lestergold: at unfave vul i cant see the point of the bid|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, and especially with a double. what if W redoubles? now you may get hurt in a variety of ways|pg||
pc|s6|nt|sybarra: E has to NOT play trumps |pg||
nt|Walddk2: If Crouch reads this, North can be endplayed to lead away from @HK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That is why a heart switch was needed at trick 2|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes cash out the side suits|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But he has to guess North's shape|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2 hearts and 3 clubs, or the other way round|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He is certain re diamonds|pg||

nt|othered1: south did echo in @C|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Or a diamond to confirm the layout|pg||
nt|roswolf: north will be endplayed twice|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Then it is also easy|pg||
nt|othered1: And east's double of 2@S had to be on more than just the @HA|pg||
nt|roswolf: in either red suit - declarer's choice|pg||

nt|yo_yo: 16 opp  7   difficult|pg||

nt|yo_yo: splinter  or fit jump  or voidwood  which?|pg||

nt|blum1956: East is hoping to buy a contract for his side))|pg||
nt|yo_yo: does the X show @S?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: even if they do go to 3H you cant rate your chances of beating iot very highly. and if they do go down 50, what have you won? risk-reward ratio very dicey|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: yes --almost certainly spades with @D toleranace |pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@C  16+ unbalanced or 17+ balanced|pg||
nt|daman: hard to stop below game now|pg||
mb|2H|nt|yo_yo: surely the dbl means more than "not penalty"!!|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 1@D  0-7|pg||
nt|roswolf: this will show off the strong club system|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: might just bid 6@C and hope for the best |pg||
mb|4H|nt|haans: or jump to 4@C GF|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why did North double over 2@C?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: *not double I mean|pg||
nt|yo_yo: another tough call for Michelle Brunner|pg||
nt|garnetts: When people used to play monet doubles --there were many times a psychic penaltry double was used--good time for it here for example :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: tradegy too as its frigid|pg||
nt|daman: it is gin|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Does that not show both red suits?|pg||

mb|p|nt|ady: this is not plain sailing|pg||

nt|lestergold: personally i think tiownsend overbid herec partner didnt even have tio have 4 reasonable,hearts|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Bakhshi knows the @S dont break from the bidding|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think 3@c expresses his values after the double|pg||
nt|yo_yo: most would bid 4@H |pg||
nt|lestergold: why?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 19 points? |pg||
nt|lestergold: west'shand is full of holes|pg||
nt|lestergold: 19 points opposie a pssoble yarborough maybe with a 3 card suit is not mandatory game|pg||
nt|lestergold: in either major|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 4-2 spade split gives this an excellent play    would Bakhshi except an invitation ?|pg||
nt|pelu: for sure NS play Michael 5+/4+ - S has absolut minimum, but very friendly steup for N|pg||
nt|othered1: dicey is a very kind way to put it|pg||
nt|lestergold: kamikaze?|pg||
pc|c5|nt|haans: now they know nothing|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Especially with the state of the match - harking back to the debate earlier about tactics|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not hard since North choose to bid 3@H--5NT will do it now |pg||
nt|blum1956: either exclusion Blackwood  (if NS use one) or just RKCB and hope for  the @dA with EW|pg||
nt|ady: disappointing|pg||
pc|cK|nt|haans: Pass forcing?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They have reached the par contract now, 6@DX|pg||

pc|c6|nt|mcarroll: He surely is not contemplating 6NT?|pg||

pc|c3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@D asking for a 5-card major|pg||
nt|othered1: and 3@D?  Puppet?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: so yes, Ed|pg||
nt|lestergold: Last year Cooke and Garvey were in the winning Camrose team which was I expect a culmination of their drwam for years|pg||
nt|daman: good for them|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Tosh comes from the "Scots wha' hae wi' Wallace bled" school|pg||
nt|othered1: Your line here?  Cross ruff possible|pg||
nt|lestergold: im askwed if 2@h is forcing here i would say it was forcing in most partnerships ithese days|pg||
nt|lestergold: obviously must be in theirs|pg||
pc|c7|nt|othered1: North can likely infer that @S are 3-3 at most in EW  hands|pg||
pc|c2|nt|yo_yo: 5 small @H and a bust and it has a play|pg||
nt|lestergold: its a moot point borderline my point is that Towsend sholuld have consulted|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c8|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Lucky that hearts are 3-3. He can test if @CJ10 doubleton first by cashing one of them|pg||
nt|lestergold: Garvey has always believed that he was the world's number one not noted for his modesty but to be fair i have always felt that he had a great talent for then game but in sufficent ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: discipline to sustain a position at the top table|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ady: but would he get the right result with a 4-2 spade split  if just consulting|pg||
pc|c9|nt|garnetts: trump next I imagine |pg||
nt|Walddk2: @CJ to indicate values in spades|pg||
nt|pelu: @cJ for @S|pg||
nt|garnetts: trump is best--the spade can wait |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Peter and I must have been partners|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|lestergold: a double followed by a 3 level cue bid tells pard that he doesnt need much to bid game posession ofa 5 CARD SUIT WOULD THEN BE HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT|pg||
nt|ady: I agree if east had just 3 small hearts and a bust then 4 hearts could cost a big number|pg||
nt|lestergold: Ssorry butterfingers this morning|pg||
nt|daman: we have our share of those on this side of the pond as well|pg||

pc|s3|pc|s6|nt|lestergold: a club away on that spade wouldnt hurt|pg||

nt|lestergold: better not continue these!!|pg||
nt|lestergold: top diamond or even a trump by south would do|pg||
nt|lestergold: dont think bakhshi can set up a long dim and enjoy without losing trump comntrol|pg||
nt|ady: dont think it matters  if Townsend pulls 1 trumpt    can discard a club on K@S   and has time to ruff a spade and a club|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: hovering over a @h|pg||
pc|dT|nt|garnetts: Poor South might be feeling a bit shell shocked after the start to this match---pressure gets to all of us |pg||
nt|lestergold: There are T shirts in circulation listing the world's top ten players Garvey at the top of course|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Then he just needs either hearts or clubs to behave|pg||
pc|dK|nt|marlowepi: yes this is not the same situation as 1D-1S-1N-2H|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: The 470 was worth 8 IMPs, 110 at the other table|pg||
nt|yo_yo: very odd|pg||
mb|2N|nt|garnetts: I like 1NT a lot more--because I hate double |pg||
nt|garnetts: If North doubles South might lead the K@H |pg||
nt|garnetts: Very well done by John here |pg||
nt|blum1956: was West's double of 1NT strong or 1-suiter? Probably strong|pg||
nt|blum1956: otherwise East shoud not pass by 2@c|pg||
nt|garnetts: I did not like the 2@D bid--why not just pass and leave it to partner?  Unless it showed a desire to play in 1NT xx|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i dont think you have to alert a penalty double of 1NT|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but other penalty doubles are now alertable|pg||
nt|garnetts: West double was penalty oriented I am fiarly sure |pg||
nt|garnetts: essential to have that option against 12-14 0r weaker |pg||
nt|blum1956: anyway EW are in serious trouble|pg||
nt|lestergold: note that the absence of a 7th club does not deter the Garve from a vul 3 level pre=empt|pg||
nt|lestergold: 1n not sure of their sys here but i assume 1C is some sort of artificial bid|pg||

nt|othered1: The double may help NS here.  Why double when you are quite likely on lead?|pg||
nt|sybarra: S would love to have the ace to send it back |pg||

nt|Walddk2: It's a miracle that I have the EW card. I have because Crouch sent it to me|pg||

nt|Walddk2: There is also a shorter version I have on hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i suspect Precision, with 2S inviting game in NT|pg||

nt|sharkey: A 2@C opener?|pg||
nt|athene: play standard stayman and smolen|pg||
nt|Walddk2: so yes, worth a 2@C opening|pg||
nt|athene: or play one of the funky puppet stayman methods where you can show that shape|pg||
pc|d3|nt|athene: 3@S is not good because it wrongsides spade contracts|pg||

nt|blum1956: looks like for EW more hands are suitable for a weak two|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@H   NF|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not a pretty fit|pg||
nt|pelu: I know it the system - but still :)|pg||
nt|athene: they play strong club, 5-card majors, multi 2@D, so 1@D is very loose|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6@s wants to be played by south asltho here as A@h is right doesnt matter|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: I'm sorry, we have to restart this room|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Patterson could also have rebid 2@S which is also non-forcing|pg||
nt|sybarra: an understatement Roland |pg||
nt|othered1: Possible for NS also to  play @H, if EW decide not to enter the auction.  But that's not the modern approach|pg||
nt|roswolf: this sort of hand shows the bow and arrow nature of these responses - remember opener is limited by his failure to open 1@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: Tosh asking what hands Patterson wouldn't bid 2@h|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You know you are in trouble when the opponents start drawing trumps|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But down in 50's|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes indeed|pg||
nt|sybarra: we call it "only 50's"|pg||
nt|lestergold: why show hearts when they have alre4ady located spade fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: dont worry Nicky anyoje takes on vugraph is very brave|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: he has a simple bid to show a good raise in spade4s|pg||
nt|henryb:  West is close to too strong for a 2N opener|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm this decision to open 2N here is going to lead to game and i dont think can make|pg||
nt|othered1: 2N is a pro-am bid, in my eyes.  Partner has no idea of trick potential in @D contract|pg||
nt|marlowepi: I think 2N would be fine if the hand were different:)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ady: Holland 3@C  for major|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i cant see the point of a transfer weak 2|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Francis Hinden made 4@H  well done to her|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Frances|pg||
nt|reisig: 4@s deny a @h cue?|pg||
nt|pelu: Sorry - I was weong they are "close" now|pg||
nt|lestergold: a bit unluckly west's hand is better than some 20 counts but has hit an unfortunate misfit minimum opposite|pg||
pc|c4|nt|yo_yo: doesnt it just give opps an extra bid?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: gained 12 imps for her team on 4|pg||
nt|lestergold: i wouldnt venture into this auction with that pile of festering horse manure with a gun to my head|pg||
pc|cA|nt|lestergold: specs want to undertsand teh system|pg||
nt|lestergold: anyone explain it|pg||
nt|lestergold: heavily artificial of course|pg||

nt|lestergold: 2n support 4@c splinter|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4@d cue i assum|pg||
nt|lestergold: the key is the nebulous 1D opening and the 2@h response|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is quite funny; an opener with no entry to his hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If this can be called an opener of course, but it is for them|pg||
pc|cT|nt|garnetts: in my view it does |pg||
nt|blum1956: It is fair when there is some strong option covered by the same bid|pg||
nt|ady: 4-1 spade split no problem with clubs behaving|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Mrs Bakhshi thinks it's a multi |pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: Ah!  Yes, looking at the wrong part of the card :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: On baord six they missed 7@H because the 5@D bids was exclusion blackwood and they could not locate the Q@H it seems |pg||
nt|ady: could they not have bid 5NT  immediately rather than 5@D?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes 5NT  asks about top honours|pg||
nt|ady: or maybe he tht Q@H not needed with a 6 or 7 card suit headed by the ace|pg||
nt|garnetts: That is my view David---seems that neither South worked out the potential--in Both rooms North showed six hearts--what else is needed--maybe just knwledge of the ace of trumps--who ...|pg||
nt|garnetts: cares about the queen when you ten including the AK |pg||
nt|yo_yo: a former team mate to Cameron Small so it's doubly satisfying for her I guess :)|pg||
pc|cK|nt|Walddk2: David Bird must be a happy man today. His county, Hampshire, won the 20/20 trophy|pg||
nt|garnetts: Do not mention 20/20 after Somerste lost yesterday sensitive issue here--especially if Jane is watching |pg||
nt|garnetts: You will make her mad Roland|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes Roland, but in 20/20 10 per over is eminently achievable - especially if an inform Gilchrist is batting|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ah by South  |pg||
nt|lestergold: 2n good support im toldthe rest is fairly starightforward|pg||
nt|marlowepi: actually 2N is OK if pd is a passed hand. but facing an unlimited partner you are just begging to miss a slam|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c6|pg||
nt|pelu: 5@S asking for @H-control?|pg||
nt|henryb:  mainly unlucky that the diamond suit doesn't run|pg||
nt|othered1: That's the point I was dancing around|pg||
nt|lestergold: Holland too good in the majors to pass 2N|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|nt|sybarra: old fashioned forcing nt might have solved this problem ending in 2 @D's or so |pg||
nt|lestergold: unfortunately i think with Towsned's minimum 12 count and awful spade suit his 3@d bid which is effectivbely a game try was an overbid|pg||
nt|yo_yo: in case 3NT is the contract|pg||
nt|yo_yo: or 4@H|pg||

pc|dK|nt|lestergold: i would think it must be by impication|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|garnetts: also you do not really need to ask for ther Q@H as you know North is not queen high for his actions |pg||
nt|garnetts: He is almost certain to have the ace |pg||
nt|lestergold: indeed very unlucky not an unreasonable bidding sequence|pg||
pc|d6|nt|lestergold: it was agood auction |pg||
pc|h5|nt|Walddk2: This can go 2 down of Shi finds the diamond shift|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|garnetts: east needs to count here --North has played it very well so far |pg||
nt|marlowepi: i know, Ed, but i felt more like kick-boxing than dancing:)|pg||

pc|dJ|nt|lestergold: coujld easily be duplicated |pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|Walddk2: I am not sure they can do that with 5 hearts as they have 2@D available for 9+ with hearts|pg||
pc|c7|nt|sybarra: their system is different|pg||
pc|c8|nt|henryb:  notice that even 2N is down since West gets squeezed|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: Sorry wrong descard there|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, Artur might open 2N, but i predict 1D|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well spotted henry--that makes 2 hands in a row where declarer could get squeezed|pg||

nt|henryb:  the @cK would not be a good choice|pg||

pc|h6|pc|hJ|nt|henryb:  in some order|pg||
nt|lestergold: the play is uninteresting what is interesting is how thye managed to overbid their hands|pg||

pc|c8|pg||
pc|hT|pc|c5|pc|hK|nt|marlowepi: obviously the 1N call has a widish range, esp. at these colours. still 3N was a lot for John to bid, having siad that, he was hoping that if the hand makes exactly nine tricks it ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: wouldnt matter if they played hearts or NT|pg||
nt|henryb:  The only good thing about this result is that the other table is not unlikely to reach 3@h and go down there also|pg||
nt|ralfwil: discard @dA and @dQ|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not clear...if the auction starts 1D-P-3D, who knows where the carousel will stop|pg||

pc|hA|nt|blum1956: it could be 12 if East had the @dQ|pg||

nt|othered1: is double meaningful?|pg||
nt|roswolf: no but slam seems to be far away from north's point of view|pg||
nt|roswolf: and this caters for the big bal hand option|pg||

mb|p|nt|lestergold: on an entertainment basis Garvey ism probably the most watchable player on the planet|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: on 10 the twins avoided the slam|pg||
nt|sybarra: S not giving that as option for W |pg||
nt|Walddk2: No, Liggins-Whittaker did|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 6NT bid to protect @SK but he does not have enough tricks|pg||
nt|othered1: 6N doesn't have a play I can see|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but double followed bye @D might not be forcing|pg||
nt|lestergold: however should be headed for the club game either way|pg||
nt|lestergold: selway should downvalue with so much in clubs opposite the splinter|pg||
nt|yo_yo: would you splinter with the South hand?|pg||
nt|ady: north not really interested in more than game with such good club values opposite a shortage|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: Of course my dog howled when he heard the bidding|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|garnetts: dbl defeats me as a bid--4@D seems logical --but dbl?   |pg||

nt|blum1956: again that antiLaw board - 22 total trumps but far less total tricks|pg||

nt|lestergold: landed right spot|pg||
nt|ady: 5 level would have been dangerous |pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|garnetts: Culbertson put forward a theory of symetrical distributions--where there was a shapely hand with a singleton likely to be another similar hand |pg||
nt|roswolf: needs a month of sundays|pg||
nt|Walddk2: @SA is perhaps a little insulting|pg||
nt|othered1: This isn't doubled, but west clearly would have doubled 7@D.|pg||
nt|sybarra: sort of why not? shortening some one some where|pg||
nt|roswolf: why - when opps bid this way insults are deserved|pg||
nt|othered1: Only very slightly nsulting.  This hasn't exactly been a confident auction|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Crouch has no defence against 7@D or 7NT so he can't double 7@C|pg||
nt|roswolf: the imp score wont be too different even if doubled!|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c2|pc|c7|nt|ralfwil: must play @dA now otherwise 12 tricks|pg||

nt|lestergold: true|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not keen on the heart lead. to me best chance of beating 3S on this auction would be to lead a minor king, try to get an ace out of dummy before hearts are set up|pg||
nt|lestergold: but i dont think we saw the actual auction wasa problem with it operator wise o think|pg||

nt|othered1: double by south is one of the stranger bids I"ve seen|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh dear|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well, yes, but he has to be thinking there is something odd about the W auction, since she passed as dealer and does not have 4 spades|pg||
nt|lestergold: i do not like 3@h on west's hand here|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|lestergold: in my opinion it is merely maximum for 2@h|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: Sorry N dbl|pg||
nt|othered1: Without complicated methods, 3@H looks OK to me.  If  you play weak jump shifts by passed  hand, 2@H may do.  But you have to keep major focus on @H|pg||
nt|lestergold: it is simply not a 3 level bid whenever partner has no heart fit likely to get into trouble|pg||
nt|lestergold: as here and with a vengeance|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if you dont bid 3H on this hand, what passed hand WOULD bid it? it is already a borderline opener as it is|pg||
nt|othered1: And isn't 4@H a reasonable spot, whatdo you think is?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: West checking system card|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lestergold: its not so much that north denied 4 hearts that he didnt promise 4@h a first round doubole would have either promised 4@h or a very stgrong hand|pg||
pc|d6|nt|blum1956: Brunner's pass was clearly forcing. Should she not have doubled herself?|pg||
pc|dT|pg||

nt|ady: nice cheap trick|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ady: down 3   |pg||
nt|lestergold: a downside of tyhe artificial 2@d bid as 2@s would have bought the contract|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lestergold: looks like at least one heart loser prob 2 likely club loser and dim loser not a great contract|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Now the @S switch required|pg||
pc|sK|nt|haans: one more "H please|pg||
pc|s6|nt|garnetts: better cash a club now |pg||
nt|sybarra: 11 imps for Crouch as the stopped in 3 nt on bd 11|pg||
pc|s9|nt|pelu: strange to open 1Nt and then bid 2@H over a Multi by S|pg||
nt|lestergold: i expected it first its fave vulnerbaiklity and second Gravey is known to bid without much provocation|pg||
nt|lestergold: Garvey never paid hi trainfare to solihull to pass|pg||
nt|georgia19: alter that quick or it'll stick:)|pg||

pc|sQ|pc|s4|pc|c4|pc|s7|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|nt|garnetts: I still cannot see the logic of failing to bid 2@S and then bidding 3@S on a queen high suit|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|othered1: Why, without looking at the actual hand, are 2@C losers likely?  don't your finesses ever win?|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if spades break normally there is no diamond loser|pg||
nt|lestergold: actuaolly rarely in my case Ed|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i would want to be in this game at IMPs. even NV|pg||
nt|lestergold: it doesnt change my view taht i would not bid 3@h with the west hand|pg||
nt|marlowepi: so what hand WOULD bid 3H as a PH?|pg||
nt|lestergold: at least the JH to impriove th trick taking security of the heart suit for example|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: I've done wrong discard by W |pg||
nt|othered1: At what point does your suggested hand become an opening, or at least a weak 2 or multi?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: OK but then it for sure is not a PH anymore|pg||

nt|marlowepi: even as it is, E had to be wondering what W could have for her sequence -- a one-suiter with enough to invite in that suit, but no opening or preempt despite not having four spades|pg||
nt|othered1: Q is normal, hoping for Jx, very unlikely on this hand|pg||
nt|othered1: Maybe a 7th card in a suit otherwise like this, if they have standards for preempts that like either better suits to open or few outside controls.|pg||
pc|c6|nt|othered1: I assume declarer h as one fewer trick than displayed here.|pg||

nt|garnetts: let the opps find their fit---maybe over 2@S North would pass --then east bids 4@S|pg||
pc|d5|pc|h9|pc|sJ|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|nt|Walddk4: I played against him for 2 hours here the other day. Most of the time he was light or off-shape for his actions|pg||
mb|2D|nt|blum1956: even if this is not the case the opponents will be often in trouble in the hearts game the opener having that kind of a hand|pg||
mb|2H|nt|garnetts: If West had opned 2@S is North really going to double?  Certainly won't bid 3@H |pg||
nt|ady: 10 imps for Hacket on board 9  where 6@H went down 1 in open room|pg||

nt|marlowepi: clear 1N, especially with 33 in majors|pg||
mb|2S|nt|yo_yo: 1NT for me|pg||
nt|lestergold: i borrow a point and protect|pg||

mb|p|nt|othered1: another possible slam|pg||

nt|lestergold: biut 6 on ice|pg||
nt|georgia19: I think they'll get there, hopefully ony to 6|pg||

nt|pelu: the last slam gave - as exp - 11 IMPs to Small|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes its a very ciommon british disease this love of the wak no  trump|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: the spades are very dodgy|pg||
nt|othered1: I guess west can justify 2@H because of the stiff @D|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3@c from W?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Tosh overcall not so clear but not likely to get nailed even when it could, and may disrupt EW just enough|pg||
nt|lestergold: personally i wouldnt play it with gun to my head but very widespread in uk|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: It looks as if Twonsend thinks this shows a hand that would have made a penalty double of 1NT|pg||
nt|yo_yo: some play the double as penalty of a weak NT|pg||
nt|ady: n/s could be in difficulty here if e/w keep doubling|pg||
nt|yo_yo: some play it shows @D|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's a slam below par obviously when you must play that suit for 1 loser|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ady: if east can double showing values  west will surely pass|pg||
nt|othered1: 4@H is quite a lucky result in OR|pg||
pc|h3|nt|othered1: are we into relays?|pg||
nt|sybarra: looks like (again)|pg||
nt|lestergold: extra values but even 5@s is alittle precarious|pg||
nt|georgia19: got that wrong then|pg||
nt|lestergold: but above 12.855 Roland|pg||
nt|georgia19: Garvey not interested over weak NT|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|garnetts: I prefer the agreement that x is pens after a weak notrump and a suit after a strong/medium notrump |pg||
nt|yo_yo: oooops   true,  no agreement :)|pg||
nt|ady: n/s of the hook|pg||
nt|georgia19: Steve taking over, now you might get some intelligent comments from here....|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|lestergold: Small has a sign off now|pg||
nt|lestergold: Small's diamond suit does not like like slam, material|pg||
nt|othered1: It looks like natural @C opening there motivated west to push with such a good fit for @C|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lestergold: Garvey is wild about getting into auctions early but doens rotuinely overbid in these situations|pg||
pc|s8|nt|pelu: where did N find that X???|pg||
nt|pelu: in CR|pg||
nt|blum1956: Against weak NT it is better to play "diamonds or strong, starting from a strong NT"|pg||
pc|sK|nt|garnetts: Some decided to dbl 3NT next door--someone should have redoubled |pg||
nt|ady: 9 tricks look a lot|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|garnetts: This is truely poor bridge from EW--|pg||
nt|yo_yo: there's not better about either, just depends which hand comes along|pg||
nt|ady: might well make on the lead|pg||
nt|yo_yo: however I would have expected a pair of such quality as townsend Bakhshi to have discussed this one|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm...|pg||
nt|lestergold: well time to put brakes on as cards lie 11 tricks ok |pg||

pc|s6|pc|s9|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|lestergold: well kin'sare on|pg||
pc|c8|nt|othered1: Here east may get squeezed in the minors for 6|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4@h bid by the darimng Malinowski who probably adds on three points for his own card play|pg||
nt|lestergold: which im afraid isa  more reliable method of hand evaluation than some|pg||
nt|othered1: Funny, but if you play support doubles, allowing east to distinguish between 3 and 4-card support, you'll likely stay out.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|georgia19: or not!|pg||
nt|georgia19: hi all|pg||
pc|cA|nt|garnetts: it should be incumbent upon players wanting to represent their country to have sorted this out |pg||
nt|yo_yo: they are a newish partnership|pg||
nt|ady: Q@H favourable this should make|pg||
nt|blum1956: the strongest part of the weak NT - you make the opponents not to know their HCP's. They often land in 22-23 HCP 3NT. Still you nead to beat that.|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|lestergold: King's were on but Small is still plunging headlong there|pg||
nt|lestergold: very un disciplined in my view|pg||
pc|d6|nt|lestergold: its a not even good enuf for roland im trying to work out how the cards would have to lie for thsi slam to be makeable|pg||
nt|ralfwil: E must win @cA if S plays a small from dummy|pg||
nt|lestergold: he will know that from the lead|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|garnetts: well I am moaning the lead was awful--and South should have doubled |pg||
pc|dA|nt|garnetts: South must double to keep EDW honest and North on track--so he doesn't look elsewhere for a lead like he has |pg||
nt|ady: e/w have useful lower diamond pips|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|yo_yo: I am corrected, Townsend/Bakhshi not a "newish" partner|pg||
nt|yo_yo: a NEW partnership|pg||
nt|blum1956: the game of bridge is not that all for high card points|pg||
nt|garnetts: NS doing well for EW on this hand|pg||
nt|garnetts: it is interesting and instructional to see play like this and where it stems from---North started with a bad lead because he though his side needed to find fast tricks  |pg||
nt|blum1956: West must establish a trick in a minor suit  to discard his 4th heart|pg||
nt|garnetts: If Souht had doubled then his opening lead would have been like ace and another heart |pg||
nt|garnetts: this would also have left dec to get on with it and he would have no chance |pg||
nt|garnetts: Shows that bridge relies upon so many tells -|pg||
nt|blum1956: is he going not to play the @dQ??|pg||
nt|ady: 10@D  would have been killing switch if 9 was with south|pg||
nt|ady: has to cover or will go down|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure I want to be in 6 on that possibility |pg||

nt|lestergold: de Botton a very experienced player of ocurse and much improved but not in her patner's league|pg||

nt|othered1: Was 2N for minors?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: yes|pg||

nt|blum1956: NS have time to establish 5 tricks for their side|pg||
nt|ady: if Holland plays a spade  when winning a heart   depends on whether Townsend ducks or not   can make by winning  when the suit is blocked|pg||
nt|yo_yo: michelle didnt peter in @D, difficult for John to lead @D|pg||

nt|athene: now declarer would be home if not for the 4-1 trump break|pg||
nt|sharkey: indeed - also if @H 4-3 and trumps 4-1|pg||
nt|athene: he can still make with a double squeeze around spades, can he?|pg||
nt|athene: maybe he can't cash the @HA at the right moment|pg||
nt|athene: he has heart threat against west and club threat against east|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Doesn't work with the breaks in the red suits|pg||
nt|athene: but both threats are under their respective guards|pg||
nt|athene: i don't think double squeeze ever works with both side threats poorly positioned, unless there is some compensating factor|pg||
nt|athene: i think he is fairly sure of the heart split|pg||
nt|athene: not just from the lead but because west returned a heart obviously expecting/hoping that east would ruff|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6@D is also the contract at the other table|pg||
nt|athene: you could play for east to have only two trumps|pg||
nt|athene: but still hard to organise two club ruffs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You have not done much right when you go 3 down|pg||

pc|dT|pc|s8|nt|Walddk2: More bad news|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now he can't even get out for 1 down|pg||
nt|athene: one club ruff + black-suit squeeze on west would only work if east had a doubleton trump as you need to cash the @HA before drawing trumps|pg||
nt|Walddk2: As he can't get back to hand without overtaking @D10|pg||
nt|athene: and there just isn't room in west's hand for all these cards we hope he has|pg||

nt|haans: fair to your team at the other table|pg||
nt|yo_yo: the key was @D to J|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n completely frigid of course s=curse the game|pg||
nt|lestergold: who will play these cards in 3n  tho?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: I was struggling to keep up there, when they go, they go fast|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|Walddk2: But he did not expect declarer to have 4 clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: lots of weak NTs|pg||
nt|roswolf: this may be feisty|pg||
nt|lestergold: easy 4@s n/s|pg||
nt|georgia19: after @D lead and @S switch it could have bben difficult with a threat of a ruff/discard|pg||
nt|georgia19: opening bids are getting weaker|pg||
nt|lestergold: probably be a push board in any case|pg||
mb|2D|nt|Walddk2: 1@C is often 12-14 balanced for N-S|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: meanwhilei see they didnt bid that esxcellent spade slam in open and one or two other swings and at presenr small is running away with this match|pg||
nt|lestergold: obviously east 3N here but with combijned 30 and a @d fit they could go exploring a slam|pg||
nt|lestergold: easy 3N i meant |pg||
mb|2N|nt|garnetts: could get interesting--case for 2@C as North |pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 1NT   a lot down|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@H is 3+ cards and can still be 12-14 balanced|pg||
nt|pelu: diff to bid 4@H - but NS-bidding can help|pg||
mb|3C|nt|yo_yo: when do you double and when do you compete|pg||
nt|ady: west likely to pass|pg||
nt|garnetts: I would rather be in 6@D than 2@D |pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: i suppose if East double he fears West will lead @S|pg||
nt|blum1956: 5@d looks the best spot. Even 6@d makeable. But East was most unhappy with his overcall. Certainly he was going to rebid|pg||
nt|garnetts: I suppose that West couldn't bid 2@D because it was conventional--personally I would bid 3@D then |pg||
mb|3D|nt|garnetts: decent 3NT for EW here|pg||
nt|sybarra: feisty all the was to 2 @C |pg||
nt|georgia19: 3 or 4 @H?|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: in the past it was verboten to open 1NT with a 5 card major|pg||
nt|ady: easy 4@S for n/s    there is a save for e/w|pg||
nt|lestergold: not many very interesting hands not the swing producers we want to see|pg||
nt|othered1: What's the *agreed* range for south's rebid?|pg||
nt|lestergold: slam of course is not awul but i think layout here will make it impossible to manage|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|nt|georgia19: 12 tricks can be made now|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: does the delayed 2@S imply a good hand, as opposed to immediate action?  If not initial pass seems strange|pg||
nt|yo_yo: South will be glad to play a hand at last|pg||
nt|lestergold: om a goodish day without even the K@c right spades go away on top hets and u ruff 2 clubs in dummy|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: seems like a bid or too may be missing?|pg||
nt|lestergold: well theyve bid it and now for the play|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: no bids missing|pg||
pc|h9|nt|georgia19: strange if south passes E/W might miss the game|pg||
nt|marlowepi: ok sorry:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: well this may be genuine Sanqvist is a known jumper |pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: :-)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lestergold: the other 12 imp swing was when Halberg strangely failed in that 4@h contract|pg||
pc|h3|nt|othered1: delayed 2@C, that is|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|lestergold: but no scope here for any expert play|pg||
nt|yo_yo: even though it's a simple one|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|lestergold: will make 5 in opractice|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Erichsen an import from Sweden|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes withholding info is sometimes key to success in slam|pg||
pc|c4|nt|garnetts: Mike Graham has said that whether you should disclose agreed tactics was discusses in Brige World a while back|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|lestergold: first diasspointment|pg||
pc|h2|nt|haans: playing clubs from right side|pg||
nt|lestergold: we were specualting on the possibilty of making 5 and he apparently we are told comndeded one off whenthe contract looked gin to us|pg||
nt|lestergold: those 2 boards the main reason for the score differential|pg||
nt|lestergold: the lead has warned about the hearts but can he do anything about it and trumps 4/1 doesnt help either|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this heart play tells  him hearts are probably 5-2, but the knowledge won;t help much|pg||
nt|lestergold: looks doomed |pg||
pc|s6|pc|h8|pc|hA|pg||
nt|lestergold: is their any double squeeze here possibnility|pg||

mb|d|mb|p|mb|3D|nt|blum1956: looks like a partscore board - one of the few|pg||
nt|garnetts: I would never have passed the east hand at green--any takers?  |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hacketts having a great card, N-S here a poor card|pg||
nt|lestergold: i would say that stick to referring to him as a native of Norway!!|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: insurgent, perhaps|pg||
nt|ady: 3@C should be down 1|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N needs to lead 4th from longest and strongest against 3N|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: think we will be hearing from Tosh shortly|pg||
mb|3S|nt|ady: south might contest with 3@H|pg||
nt|othered1: Why?|pg||
mb|4C|nt|lestergold: 9 easy tricks available as cards lie|pg||
nt|ady: whoever plays should get the minus|pg||
nt|lestergold: quite likely he would not epect to have enuf defence to beat 3@c and it is fave vul|pg||
nt|lestergold: fave vul he does have 7 playimng tricks in clubs|pg||
mb|d|nt|yo_yo: a reverse|pg||
nt|lestergold: as cards lie i thinkl 3@h makes|pg||
nt|othered1: Usually it's right to get in early, before they have so much information|pg||
nt|lestergold: god didnt deal you a 9 card suit to pass with it|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|haans: error |pg||
nt|othered1: three major slam swings in 4 boards.  Exciting.|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: i prefer 2@S to 3|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm Bakhshi is dipping his toe into 500 territory |pg||
nt|ady: might have mad 3@H|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes but tosh may think it important to warn his gung ho pard that he has only got a zillion clubs|pg||
nt|othered1: In defense, cash out is necessary.|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: auction good here we go|pg||
pc|s7|nt|garnetts: 2NT for me not 2@S  |pg||
nt|blum1956: Brunner is disciplined|pg||
nt|yo_yo: at least that shows 5@H|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes fun at the other table|pg||
nt|yo_yo: this is the best spot for NS|pg||
nt|georgia19: whoops, better stop soon guys|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well then you need to bid earlier. all the signs are wrong here -- N is almost surely short in clubs and an EW game may have little play|pg||
nt|lestergold: well only one off 100 now|pg||
nt|marlowepi: club lead a standout|pg||
pc|sK|nt|garnetts: Seems EW are at cross purposes|pg||
nt|haans: by West or ...|pg||
nt|mcarroll: A bit surprising game not reached|pg||
nt|Walddk2: One thought 3@S was forcing, the other one did not|pg||
nt|garnetts: One thinks 3@S is forcing and the other doesn't |pg||
nt|garnetts: Bidding 2@S gives information about not leading a spade--which I would be keen not to do--2NT doesn't preclude a heart contract |pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes  agree|pg||
nt|garnetts: 2NT gets a spade lead and bidding 2@S gets a lead you don't like |pg||
nt|ady: favourable lie of the majors   but still only 8 tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: even 5 level looks probelmatic|pg||
nt|ralfwil: A shot in the dark! Why not start with @cK (or @cA)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Walddk2: 1NT rebid is 17-19 balanced or semi-balanced|pg||
nt|othered1: was 2@D Flint-like?|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|roswolf: de botton in command|pg||

nt|georgia19: should be ok as we see it|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lestergold: oh they are in trouble|pg||
nt|yo_yo: will he run?|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 5@h tricks 2 @s 2 @d and a spade ruff in dummy thats ten|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|Walddk2: 2@D is a relay and shows 4+ spades|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@S to play|pg||
nt|lestergold: how do you propse 11 tricks georgia?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lestergold: he has punished partner for his protection holding no fit in  clubs and just basically a couple of bulletsd a hand laccking in trick taking power|pg||
nt|ady: someone should run to 4@C    but still down 2   but may not be doubled|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh i think erichsen didnt double 3N if he wasnt doubling 4@c|pg||
nt|lestergold: second spade ruff promotes the T@h|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|georgia19: wow, can this be made.... nasty club position, I can't see it myself|pg||
nt|lestergold: and the club position is ugly |pg||
pc|d2|nt|garnetts: snap sorry|pg||
nt|ady: could be trouble here|pg||
nt|yo_yo: danger of making now|pg||
nt|lestergold: well i dont agree with this lead partner has said lead ur suit its nisht machen|pg||
nt|lestergold: bow eruichsen could easily go wrong here|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes seems quite a poor lead decision|pg||
pc|d7|nt|mcarroll: Great minds!!|pg||
pc|dT|nt|blum1956: yes the diamond lead is crucial for beating 3NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: well he hasnt|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|lestergold: have a look at dummy cant hurt|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lestergold: can set up a club trick ruffing high but then ruffing spae loser sets up that pesky @h ten|pg||
nt|lestergold: garvey has gone for a deceptive play here|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hT|nt|Walddk2: 1@S  2@H  ;  2@S  3@D  ;  3@H  3@S  ; 4@S  is a possible auction|pg||
nt|lestergold: so only 8 tricks altho should have been 2 off|pg||
nt|yo_yo: south in trouble now on the run of the @C|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes may well|pg||
nt|panja: hi all, there will be an endplay in Diamonds...N needed to shift to a @D..|pg||
nt|yo_yo: can discard 2@D and 1@S easily but then??|pg||
nt|lestergold: i cannot understaqnd the lead|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|haans: 3@S nonforcing in old Acol time|pg||

pc|hK|nt|georgia19: may get out for -1 now|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|nt|garnetts: on the last hand the auction in the OR room was odd to say the least--East was unbelievably conservative |pg||
nt|yo_yo: j@S will be welcome|pg||
nt|garnetts: West overcalled 1@C with 1@D and west just bid hearts twice |pg||
nt|yo_yo: NS under a lot of pressure now|pg||
pc|h5|pc|c3|pg||
mc|9|nt|garnetts: Dixon and Silverstone have for years thought three of amjor was a pointless contrcat and simply agreed that it was always forcing |pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@S is the default rebid with an unbalanced minimum hand without 3 hearts, so it did not guarantee six cards|pg||
nt|othered1: I don't charge the lead.  Of course I'm speaking from the pov of only west's cards and the auction|pg||
nt|othered1: Rather I don't "black charge" the lead.  @C isn't unattractive|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the only reason i can think of not to lead a club is if partner has a stiff club and a stiff heart|pg||
nt|marlowepi: and that is impossible|pg||

nt|roswolf: could be a lot of bidding here|pg||
nt|roswolf: how many spades?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Close to 4|pg||
nt|othered1: That 1N overcall(as opposed to an opening) wouldn't be everyone's cup of tea.  West's great @Slength, however, is a great catch.|pg||
nt|roswolf: a case for 3@S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4 can go down but it may not|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It takes a club ruff to beat 4@S|pg||
nt|roswolf: or 4@S or even 2@S SAY SOME SPECS|pg||
nt|othered1: 4@H isn't hopeless, is it? But they won't get to play there|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Is it obvious that they will find the defence against 4@S?|pg||
nt|lestergold: undoubtedly one of our best card players|pg||
mb|3C|nt|Walddk2: I don't think so|pg||
nt|roswolf: not at all|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: did the right thing   5 too high|pg||
nt|lestergold: schooledijn decades of high stake rubber bridge|pg||
nt|ady: e/w can make either 3NT or 5@C  with K@D well placed   but have been kept out of the bidding|pg||
mb|3D|nt|yo_yo: Townsend got it right , as he had with every decision this match|pg||
nt|roswolf: good 2-way shot|pg||
nt|othered1: Not sure 5 is easy on a @C lead, but 4 should be OK|pg||
nt|othered1: @H|pg||
nt|othered1: 2@H in their system?|pg||
nt|lestergold: bad suit bad hand no lead directional benefit the old principles apply as far qas im concerned|pg||
nt|lestergold: cant hardly blame malinowski for raising to game|pg||
mb|3S|nt|Walddk2: wow|pg||
nt|Walddk2: what a lead|pg||
nt|othered1: 4@S down is a bit unllucky|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|nt|lestergold: 4@h cold as cards lie|pg||
nt|lestergold: of course no reason for them to get there|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: indeed nick is very very good combines flair with excellent technique|pg||
nt|othered1: One way to get @C ruff, if both N and S read it correctly|pg||
nt|yo_yo: South will be surprised to be undoubled|pg||
nt|georgia19: going to be played from other side - doubt if it'll make much difference|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|garnetts: I think no decision here--must be right to pass--might have been tempted on the South hand except that partner has passed already |pg||
nt|blum1956: I would pass as well - to find 6@h you need a stiff club and this is not enough while 5@h may well go down|pg||

nt|ady: sorry   not quiet lay down  on a passive lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: they need to have the kit to find their @d fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: oh well we are meant to use surnames especially for non british specs benefit but some leeway allowed garvey is surely so infamous that almost any name will do|pg||

nt|roswolf: game forcing i think|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 12 to 12! perhaps 3nt with so many middel cards (10s and 9s)|pg||
pc|dK|nt|Walddk2: If no interference it would have been 4+ spades, 3+ hearts, invitational|pg||
nt|roswolf: may well be a push|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But that is obviously not the case here|pg||
nt|ady: needs heart guess|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|yo_yo: he denied 4@H so that's a cue bid agreeing @D|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes it needs heart taken the 'unnatural' way i wonder how that happened in the open room|pg||
pc|c6|pc|cJ|nt|lestergold: cards very favourable for e/w|pg||
nt|lestergold: small not being able to continue club attack and south may never get in|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pg||
nt|garnetts: Normal these days to bid on not a lot in response --has its merits too|pg||
nt|ady: 2@H shows a good rebid of 2@S   a transfer rebid   2@S  would have been weaker|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dQ|pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||
pc|h2|nt|garnetts: I wouldn't have led that |pg||
nt|roswolf: tosh will be depressed looking at dummy|pg||

nt|lestergold: now the play is everything!|pg||
pc|hK|nt|yo_yo: now to see our  "immigrant" in action|pg||
nt|ady: with east showing singleton diamond  this is likely to made  heart guess likely |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Results from round 1: Rosen v Senior 25-4 ; Teltscher v P Hackett 19-11 ; Small v Hinden 17-13, and de Botton v Crouch 16-14|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i think he will get it right, will find the singleton !@D and long @C with Bakhshi|pg||
nt|lestergold: if south reads east for club length on the bidding and lead he may find it hard to read the heart however when east shows up with stiff trump he will have a lot of thinki9ng to do|pg||

nt|ady: 4@H seems to be a make here     3@D -2   a misunderstanding|pg||

nt|athene: Garvey was close to a double of 2@S i think but he does need extras for it, facing 0-7|pg||
nt|lestergold: phantom of the opera |pg||
nt|athene: he knows Cooke will be there with a bid if there is a bid on the north cards anywhere to be found|pg||
nt|georgia19: 4@C or 4@H?|pg||
nt|georgia19: or a mad pass?|pg||
mb|2N|nt|roswolf: maybe not|pg||
nt|othered1: If that's multi, there are lots of different defenses to it.   Some let  you make a takeout "double" of @H immediately, but west's @S holding might be inadequate|pg||

mb|p|nt|roswolf: this looks -2 for sure|pg||
nt|lestergold: no wsay|pg||
nt|athene: lots of very interesting tactical/psychological issues for south|pg||
nt|athene: if you are scared of 4@S making, you might bid 4@C|pg||
nt|athene: on the principle that they will bid 4@S over 4@H more than over 4@C|pg||

pc|h3|nt|yo_yo: tempting to bid 3NT with the north hand now|pg||
nt|lestergold: twice as many bnids to reach 3N in open room that was the only difference|pg||
nt|lestergold: south good enuf to know that 4@s is very unlikely|pg||
nt|athene: now East needs to lead a heart through at some point to break up the endplay|pg||
