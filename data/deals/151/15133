nt|lestergold: well a tame defence may let this thru|pg||
nt|chick: ouch, and N rescues them|pg||
nt|haans: but ...|pg||
nt|jaheim: hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 3@C of course, partner should have both minors|pg||
nt|pelu: but pass is not an option by N - 2@S?|pg||
nt|frankaus: the scorer is the cheif scorer for the Aust BF  - has done an excelent job|pg||
nt|npcjpn: looks like pass forces redouble.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: greetings everyone|pg||

mb|5D|nt|sharkey: East elected to bid NV - not unexpected|pg||

nt|npcjpn: at least NS got the game so far.|pg||
nt|kaz08833: NS reached correct contract|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Martin and Tom are two of our leading players altho Reid usually plays with Newell|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: early coffee hand here :)|pg||

nt|kastan88: Australia 270  6. India 269|pg||
nt|kastan88: Pakistan on 7th place|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Lasut and Manoppo are a great pair|pg||
nt|kastan88: at once slam hand, 6@C on double finesse in diamonds|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hi Wu good luck in your operating :)|pg||
mb|6D|nt|lestergold: i must admit that as south i would chance a double here i like to earn imps|pg||
nt|jaheim: NS  won the mixed pair chship this year|pg||
nt|mcarroll: and adopting the trend towards 5 rather than 6 card suit|pg||
nt|jaheim: lots of toppairs playing 2 @D as a weak muli   and 2 @H @S as a serious weak 2|pg||
nt|kastan88: fight for partscore, after club lead and spade switch would be -1, West will getting spade ruff. Now just made.|pg||
nt|iceblue: 1 major|pg||
nt|djneill:  South can construct some good slam hands for North's free 2@s bid - must have 5+@d and surely the @sK|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: presumably S cannot open 2H, but a more likely alternative would seem to be 1H. cant argue with success though:)|pg||
nt|chick: Pass by S is also an alternative :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: very odd to bid 4H when 3N is virtually sure to go down|pg||
nt|frankaus: we are too lazy (or drunk) to look to see if the suns out :)|pg||
nt|kastan88: no more troubels for EW,  every partscore (1NT, 2@H doubled) probably -4 for them and -800|pg||
nt|kaz08833: easy 10 tricks, maybe 11|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Korea 11th NZ 10th at this stage|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: I see 8 tricks?|pg||
nt|lestergold: nom heart ruff but an immediate diamond swirtch and force will be uncomfortabelm fro declarer|pg||
nt|haans: slam possible :)|pg||
nt|april7: very aggressive bid by E|pg||
nt|jaheim: 2 @D   prob   1 major|pg||
nt|april7: @S lead would be good,then down|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 2@H Doubled would have been interesting|pg||
nt|jaheim: ............  and expensive|pg||

nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/2b44yyj  for results and standings before the last round|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@C should lead to a rapid sign-off from East|pg||
nt|rv: I presume Kushari's splinter is limited, Laltu (East's nickname) did have couple of useful cards, but poor @s suit must have decided to lie low|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: would 2@HX be more pleasant for N?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaheim: tydligvis en xy nt i sving|pg||
nt|jaheim: ø har vist en invitthånd med 5 + spar|pg||
nt|lestergold: wehn the lord deals you jt9xx of trumps, he meant you to double|pg||
nt|othered1: 25 HCP and stopped at 2@S.  East's psyche had something to do with it.|pg||

nt|mdgraham: Remember the Goon Show? Neddy Seagoon: "Gosh, the Sun's hot" Bluebottle: "Then you shouldn't touch it"   |pg||
nt|mathat: manoppo thinking loose 1 @d 1 @h who many loos in @c|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes alas 2 red aces|pg||
pc|h9|nt|Walddk4: Velkommen tilbake|pg||
nt|haans: why 4@H?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Mercifully undoubled|pg||
nt|pelu: even after pass in 1. seat N sh have an A more!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Nobu, please tell us about the Japanese ladies. Have they been regulars in the team for long?|pg||
nt|npcjpn: This EW pair has been played together for a long time.|pg||
nt|frankaus: we can see scores from all matches as they come in|pg||
nt|iceblue: Sun-wang play prec, |pg||

nt|iceblue: dbl=select ur majors pls|pg||
nt|h_karluk: http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=3649  Sun Ming|pg||
nt|iceblue: vs str 1NT, 2@D is ok for me,|pg||
nt|bucheister: no good lead by N she might try a heart; certainly a spadewill not beat this|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: this should be beaten a trick, unless something odd happens|pg||
nt|djneill:  gary is North's 5@d implying a bad hand|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|haans: i prefer 1@H to 3|pg||
nt|chick: with 2 aces and 3 hearts, N must know that 3N is doomed.   must be he thought 4@H was makeable|pg||
nt|haans: true|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in that case why wouldnt he bid it on the porevious round?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: surely E was not going to pass 3HX|pg||
nt|frankaus: fairly transparent singleton lead |pg||
nt|rv: He will hop with @DA, pitch @c on @CK, draw trumps and concede a @d|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: in fact by 2, if def get club ruff|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes and 3@D makes easily|pg||
pc|hA|nt|haans: Results?|pg||
nt|chick: 3@HX is better than 4@H|pg||
nt|baardolav: Hello|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Looks like 11 tricks|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 9 tops|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: no overs|pg||
nt|kastan88: or to try for @D finesse now?|pg||
nt|kastan88: and some overs|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: doesnt need it|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hey LM|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I would have passed 2@H|pg||
nt|djneill:  well done to E-W to get in the way |pg||
nt|djneill:  South needed North to have Kxxx  Ax  KQxxx  xx or Kxxx  xxx  AKxxxx x or similar|pg||
nt|djneill:  all very plausible, I think North's 2@s was rash holding the @hKxx|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sharkey: Ser ut som 9 stikk|pg||
nt|haans: 1@D no 5 card M|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: back in few minutes, must restart|pg||
nt|april7: it doesn't matter what S plays if the continuTION IS OK|pg||
nt|kastan88: Singapore is on 6th place, Bahrain on 16th place (19 countries participating)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: and C-T stopped in the making game so a flying start|pg||
pc|hK|nt|haans: poor believer|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Baard Olav Aasan|pg||
nt|baardolav: Hello all|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello all and welcome back |pg||
nt|kastan88: why not, if hearts 4-2?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: well bid just need to make it|pg||
pc|h7|nt|npcjpn: In open room, South did not enter, so 1NT was the contract.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: you win :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: could test @H first|pg||
nt|kastan88: 11 tricks,|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: @C's away if he gets @H going in time|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Jan Arne, Carl og vores operatør, Liv-Marit|pg||
nt|lestergold: if they find the doubhkle in the other room you are in for a massive loss |pg||
nt|jaheim: and  bronze medals  in the mixed team |pg||
nt|haans: other matches?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/2b44yyj  for results and standings after round 4|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: no worries here|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: that helps|pg||
nt|kastan88: and they bid that, well done|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|Walddk4: and Mike Graham|pg||
nt|april7: loks like only 1 down because of stiff Q of @S|pg||
nt|bucheister: at favorable vul I like 3S and many experts would open 3S even at NV|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: away goes the ruff|pg||
pc|d3|nt|sharkey: Needed a @H lead from S - hardly to be expected I think|pg||
nt|haans: but may make Jt9 in @D = good|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Good morning all|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Indeed. The system I tend to use is that the Double of 2@D indicates that I was going to transfer to @Hs|pg||
nt|jaheim: EW  currently 2.   NS 4. place|pg||
nt|mcarroll: S thinking, 2 shows an honour, so it has to be either A or Ten, |pg||
pc|d5|nt|vugraphznb: EW are brothers|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this contract does not look to be in danger|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/2b44yyj  for results and standings after round 10 of 14|pg||
nt|jaheim: hi   BOA|pg||
nt|kastan88: still down, needed to play 1st trumps|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: well, defence have now missed their opportunity for that ruff|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: danger of too many tricks|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|lestergold: the play for a ruff iss too slow and north has no entry now to play diamonds so this will make after all|pg||
nt|jaheim: 1. of all    tks to our exelent operator Liv Marit Grude,    and congrat.   with silver medal in the Junior ( baby?)  chship|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: impressive start Jaak|pg||
pc|h3|nt|npcjpn: The other pair in open room is relatively new partnership.|pg||
nt|frankaus: we can also see the result fron each board from every table|pg||
pc|h8|nt|marlowepi: certainly true that Pass is an option for S. my comment about 1H was based on the manifest intention of S to do something other than the textbook pass, so i whould have prefaced my ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: remark with "given that S wanted to be active here...,"|pg||

nt|frankaus: we are all from cricketing countries - we can bore the world with cricket analogies :)|pg||
nt|kastan88: 2@H doubled depends from opening lead, with @S or @D lead even may be -3 or -2 only|pg||
nt|kastan88: @SK and @HQ both laying right, so possible is 6@D, but rather, who bids that|pg||
nt|mathat: and now??????? fines @s or|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes time for a trump|pg||
pc|d9|nt|dslee: Good evening frank and RV|pg||

nt|kastan88: Gary, how about 2NT bid from West? without @S stopper.... For estonia usual still to double here, |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Australia 6th Singapore 10th|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: declined the overtrick imp?|pg||
nt|kastan88: hmm even not tried for +1?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: wd 11 imps|pg||
nt|kastan88: congrats to Japan!|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: so 10 imps out of nothing really|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: results here as they come through http://www.bridgeunlimited.com/bridge/ViewMasterEvent2?code=10ASIA&header=pabf|pg||
nt|kastan88: i think need to check that, probably 11 tricks.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/2b44yyj  for results and standings after round 3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: certainly there are hands where 3N could make and 4HX be a good save -- mostly they start with a longish minor lacking only the ace plus two heart stoppers and enough spade tricks ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: to get to nine. but it is extremely pessimistic to save since there are zillions of hands where 3N fails, maybe by several tricks. so if you don;t try for that kind of good result ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: when your preempt creates the opportunity, you ought to stop  preempoting|pg||
nt|davidstern: Irashaimase Nobu|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i doubt, why not @c, but may mean different in their sys|pg||
nt|iceblue: 1@D is another choice|pg||
nt|kastan88: not safety to try hearts 1st, then @DQ may be in South hand, and you cant give away @D safety.. problems with entries, and of course South could have @SK|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hard EW to keep out of this slam too|pg||
nt|djneill:  other room South started with a forcing @d raise and then splintered in @h and North could evaluate the @hK as a bad card|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: excellent|pg||
nt|djneill:  opposite short @h, North wants Axx, or xxx, not Kxx or QJxx|pg||
nt|djneill:  East's rule of 20 opening, looks pretty good to me, gary would you open 1@s in standard?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: always|pg||
nt|djneill:  West has a small interest in slam|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Sidney must be thinking slam thoughts and how best to proceed|pg||

nt|djneill:  thanks Roalnd|pg||
nt|djneill:  Roland*|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: simple 2@C to start I would have thought|pg||
nt|djneill:  West just cares about the @c control, I think Jacoby 2NT would work here|pg||
nt|djneill:  set @s, start cue-bidding|pg||
nt|djneill:  East will show a @c control (that he couldn't over a natural 2@c)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes then 3@C by opener = shortage?|pg||
nt|djneill:  should get to 6 after RKC reveals off one keycard?|pg||
mb|2N|nt|sharkey: vi ligger litt foran :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: Yes - problem was S was on lead - likely to favor declarer|pg||
nt|haans: we will not get abid fron West|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Sorry, missed a few rounds as I had to get the phone|pg||
nt|april7: might end up in 4@S by NS or 5@H by EW|pg||
nt|npcjpn: but only 3 teams in womens, Australia, New Zealand and Japan.|pg||
nt|frankaus: do we open as south ?|pg||
nt|iceblue: they are playing prec|pg||
nt|h_karluk: what's 1@c range?|pg||
nt|kaz08833: neither sids has game but it's likely some kind of disasters may happen on this one|pg||
nt|kastan88: depending of course, that strong hand playing 2@H, but not easy to reach there|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes must be their style, if N had kept 1@H there would be no finesse at the end|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: that is an opener for some these days :(|pg||
nt|bucheister: Hi I am John Buchheister and will commenting on this match in the closed room|pg||

mb|p|nt|haans: or will we?|pg||
nt|haans: assume X is penalty|pg||
nt|haans: weak openings make it harder for opps to bid their cards|pg||
nt|frankaus: we are resorting to betting on two flies here - no-one knows how to rigg that contest|pg||
nt|rv: 3rd pre-empts are GOK, can be very weak to near opening hand esp at this vul|pg||
nt|xenya: i would|pg||
nt|frankaus: Y for me|pg||
nt|othered1: NS playing Precision, I presume?|pg||
nt|iceblue: too poor suit for 2@C|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: they are not an established partnership, but as this team is self funded, are together|pg||
nt|kastan88: for me too, we are quite crazy here in Estonia|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: NS in trouble now|pg||
nt|npcjpn: brave 4NT oppsite passed partner.|pg||

nt|vugraphzrc: 10 is right|pg||

nt|djneill:  East's 3@c we cannot be sure but in std Jacoby that is short @c - some people play it a little modified to show min/max then shortness|pg||
mb|p|nt|kastan88: me too, always|pg||
nt|xenya: why not|pg||
nt|iceblue: yes, prec with 14-16 1NT|pg||

mb|3S|nt|haans: but alerted|pg||

nt|jaheim: so the winner of this match will win the tournament|pg||
nt|npcjpn: Quite impressive!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Do they play an invitational sequence after the 1NT rebid I wonder|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Seems like it|pg||
nt|dslee: NS should collect|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I'll bet this double isn't penalty, though|pg||
nt|coolvijay: 5@d on the cards on the finesse of @d q|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: minors or 2 suiter|pg||
nt|kastan88: 3NT must be some preemptive raise in both majors, if they play multi?|pg||
nt|kastan88: or onli strong 2@D?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 2@D 3 way multi 3NT 4-4 majors pass or correct|pg||
nt|Walddk3: Our matches tomorrow are China v Singapore (women), Pakistan v Indonesia (open), and Indonesia v Japan (women) |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: indeed we have|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: 3@C nå fra N?|pg||

nt|lestergold: i dont really understand the defence the play for the ruff wsd pstently hopeless when a forcing game had obviousn prospects|pg||
nt|sharkey: Kib points out @D9 a better lead with actual holding|pg||
nt|lestergold: coffee break hand 4 easy peasy @h|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good morning to Ed Shapiro|pg||
nt|davidstern: He was the third from the right|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 2@C forcing 2@D, then 3@S? Invitational with 6|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Probably not since East is thinking|pg||
nt|dslee: 3@H now|pg||
nt|xenya: more interestingly, do we overcall as W?|pg||
nt|othered1: 41S is really pushy, since almost nobody requires extras for a 1@S free bid nowadays|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: need to bid it to match the OR|pg||
nt|djneill:  3@s is interesting, I wonder why West did not bid a red Ace|pg||
nt|djneill:  could be a relay sequence|pg||
mb|4C|nt|othered1: Good morning, everybody, from overcast central Pennsylvania, USA|pg||
nt|jaheim: D  is prob  3 @H|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: lol|pg||
nt|mdgraham: bet it shows 13 cards, some of them pictures|pg||
nt|rv: NS not sure of their agreements here possibly, I presume North took South's X as responsive|pg||
nt|dslee: the hint N has to take is that his ptr might not have a 4 card M|pg||
nt|rv: in modern expert methods, I presume South should pass and collect undoubled if North can't double again|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 9 tricks could be made here as cards lie|pg||
nt|mathat: 2 rund @c and A K @d ruf to the dammy and 1 mor @s|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: S ikely to try the 10 here |pg||
nt|haans: good bidding |pg||
nt|mcarroll: Tricky contract|pg||
nt|davidstern: 4@S is a little unlucky oonb this hand with two diamond ruffs and the spade offside|pg||
nt|mdgraham: one possibility was to start with 2@H over 2@D, but you can understand the double  |pg||
nt|kaz08833: 5@c will go down, probably 2|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: which should come home with 3S, 3D, a heart and 2 clubs, even if defence find best start of a heart|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Patrick has nothing much to show|pg||
mb|4N|nt|jaheim: evt   2 nt|pg||
nt|sharkey: Det var vel alternativet|pg||
nt|jaheim: valgte kløvern, hadde fortjent å finne makker med omvendt minorfarger   imo|pg||
nt|sharkey: God strategi å sette press på motstanderne i gunstig sone|pg||
nt|jaheim: 2 @H  prob  shoving 3 + @H|pg||
nt|april7: best is to cash 2 top @D and then playing @C ace and @C|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: 3@H should make on the nose|pg||
nt|davidstern: 3@H last making spot|pg||
nt|frankaus: real tough to find the right strain and level on this 1|pg||
nt|dslee: 2@H is better bid from N|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and now NS are swinging across the line|pg||
nt|rv: I will fault South's double here more than North's first double|pg||
nt|mdgraham: to be fair, this is a very awkward hand for NS|pg||
nt|frankaus: my choice would bre 3NT after the X by N|pg||
nt|bucheister: E has to bid 5H|pg||
nt|h_karluk: it sounds modified prec there|pg||
nt|othered1: Yes, east can't presume a canape overcall . . . |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: which they didn't|pg||
nt|kastan88: mostly coz 4-card @S in my hand, with 3 or less spades I would pass|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 11 opp 8 whatever|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to John Buchheister|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: :(|pg||
nt|haans: if they make 1NTx they do not get game |pg||
nt|chick: 4@H looks good superficially, but I think difficult to make.  3@S has no chance.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: we can see that spade intervention might make this tricky, but the chance for that has gone|pg||
nt|kastan88: with trump lead just lot of down|pg||
nt|kaz08833: S is an expert dummy player and he might take 10 tricks|pg||
nt|djneill:  there's the magic 4@c West was waiting for, |pg||
mb|5D|nt|lestergold: technically 4@s is a vbiablem save but who is gonna bid it it could be heading for 800 not agood imnvestment unless you cansee al the cards|pg||
nt|jaheim: S is prob. very tired,  a "old"  (59)  lady playing every day since last friday|pg||
nt|sharkey: hi everyone|pg||
nt|chick: Hi Carl|pg||
nt|pelu: u were right with 3@s :)|pg||
nt|rv: South should either pass (my choice) or bid 3n|pg||
nt|mdgraham: looks like they will get to 4@H|pg||
nt|frankaus: when in doubt ........... bid 3NT ......... Hamman|pg||
nt|iceblue: @C lead would set it|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 4@S has been missed here with 10 top tricks cashing AK@S|pg||
nt|djneill:  welcome John|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: hi Cornelia|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Interesting lead. With no entry to the @Ss and with a limited auction, trying to find partners strength|pg||
nt|rnmalik: indeed. @SJ would have been interesting.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Absolutely|pg||
nt|baardolav: should make even if all the "quesses" goes wrong|pg||
nt|april7: S has to play Q of @H or small @H from dummy to make this contract,because S will not guess stiff K of @C|pg||

nt|Walddk4: The hands fit nicxely and game is easy|pg||
nt|super nova: Some people like to play 8 ever 9 never|pg||
nt|bucheister: I am not sure; but we will find out|pg||
nt|kastan88: another case here what to do with West hand, if partner opens with  light 1@C|pg||
nt|bucheister: Gary there has been an amazing turn around competing against 1nt openings; years ago you very seldom jumped in the auction; now with any excuse|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: re John welcome|pg||
mb|6S|nt|sharkey: Da burde vel ikke Pd ha x første gang?|pg||
nt|henryb:  I would love to know how East made 6N|pg||
nt|haans: Hi Ed|pg||
nt|henryb:  Hello Hans, Ed|pg||
nt|haans: Hi Henry|pg||
nt|baardolav: 3@s is a better bid than 3@h|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Well, maybe not easy|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.pabf2010.co.nz/Participants/Convention-Cards/Women/Japan.aspx|pg||
nt|super nova: hence not to take the @d finesse|pg||
nt|frankaus: a "round" 12 is not everybody's idea to open - but A + 2K  hard to pass |pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: kib: GRASSHOPI: I'd have preferred X to 3@D me: and then what|pg||
nt|npcjpn: even @HQ wasted, I am surprised Asbi's pass over 2@s.|pg||
nt|iceblue: She got it|pg||
nt|kastan88: after such bidding, sure, needed trump lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: this has a play IMO|pg||
nt|mdgraham: credit the 2@D opening with making NS work|pg||
nt|h_karluk: mainly there are 5 opening bids in the precision system : 1@c 18+, 1@d 10+, 1@h 10+ w 5cm @h, 11s same, 1N 15-17 (th important point dont bid if u ve 14-18)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: looks like they are getitng there.|pg||
nt|frankaus: c!Q well placed|pg||
nt|frankaus: @CQ|pg||
nt|rv: this contract can make since @CQ well placed and both @hs and @cs breaking|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: bd 1 an exact push|pg||
nt|bucheister: Hi everyone, I am John Buchheister and will be assisting with the commentators this even; hello Aussie and Dan|pg||
nt|djneill:  at the other table, 6@s was reached and made|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Kiwi please :)|pg||
nt|djneill:  and my name's not Bruce|pg||
pc|d5|nt|coolvijay: true|pg||
nt|super nova: however when a 6 card spade suit is shown the odds tend to favor the fineese so |pg||
nt|super nova: should make in theory.|pg||
nt|djneill:  could be confusing :-)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|othered1: easy plus for NS, even though you might score a bit more in @S|pg||
nt|chick: perhaps, but I don't like to bid a weak 2 in first seat with such a nice major holding spades here|pg||
nt|pelu: I see a loser in 4 suits :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: system info courtesy of Nick Jacob who is in the audience :)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|haans: no not a perfect |pg||
nt|othered1: For my style, the @D suit is two higher honors short.|pg||
nt|chick: especially diamonds, which rarely has much preempt value|pg||
nt|h_karluk: do i remember right Ice?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: maybe not but this will be a satisfactory result|pg||
nt|mathat: opp play first A K @C and A K @d|pg||
nt|kastan88: Manos right|pg||
nt|kastan88: then trump trick away|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: ok, but 6 imps as team mates stole it in 3@C|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: the sight of good @H's will be welcome|pg||

pc|sT|nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/2b44yyj  for results and standings after round 6|pg||
nt|Walddk4: True, on the heart lead|pg||
nt|Walddk4: If not, a heart goes away on a club|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: in this case, makes the @S hook odds on :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: board 1 a swish neither side could find the slim game|pg||

nt|h_karluk: ok modified variants|pg||
nt|npcjpn: on this hand, 4NT worked poorly, but if partner holds East hand...|pg||

pc|sK|pg||
nt|chick: N could have safely led a heart at trick 2, and saved one club ruff, but S is doing it for him|pg||

nt|sharkey: I thought he was down 1 as dummy provided two discards after @SA|pg||

nt|marlowepi: as a very active player, S must be disappointed to be in 4th shair with that hand|pg||
nt|mcarroll: At least Helness eventually got a @C trick :)|pg||
nt|april7: I think so too, either ruff in hand losing another 2 @H or ruffing in dummy and losing control|pg||
nt|baardolav: Forget it:) was if Aabye played a spade for the ace... after diamond ruff|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Sorry thought the @SAAce had been taken out|pg||

nt|iceblue: oh no, @HA? then why not ruff with @HQ?|pg||

nt|bucheister: ???? result; seems it was down one|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i suppose the bidding would go pass pass 1@h |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: a very costly excercise|pg||
nt|kaz08833: btw- what call is recommended with N's hand after 3@h opening?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|lestergold: shouldnt be difficul;t to bid slam here a more interesting hand at mps where 6N by east would be the best spot|pg||
nt|jaheim: stron cl|pg||
nt|jaheim: strong|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2S?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: good grief, 2@d :)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Looked like a Muiderberg for S|pg||
nt|april7: S might bid NT over N's overcall of 1 @S and play there|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: this looks like another part-score coming up (you'll all be delighted to hear)|pg||
nt|npcjpn: pass|pg||
nt|kastan88: for me pass|pg||

nt|frankaus: some call it a smelly hand -  4711|pg||
nt|h_karluk: then the question east wld x or not, probably wld also pass|pg||
nt|iceblue: i think W mb ruff with @HQ instead of @H8|pg||
nt|bucheister: or two.  doesn't N make a heart anda spade?|pg||
nt|djneill:  should North bid over South's 2@c John?|pg||
mb|2C|nt|sharkey: Spørs om NS kan få med seg @H stikkene her|pg||
nt|haans: no support x|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2D is the obvious call but it has the disadvantage of letting W bid hearts cheaply|pg||
nt|marlowepi: good hand for transfers faci ng overcalkls|pg||
nt|mcarroll: W passed?|pg||
nt|april7: W should have opened the bidding|pg||
nt|jaheim: My money is on "Filosofene"   any sidebets   ?  :)|pg||
nt|frankaus: after the brand of perfume|pg||
nt|h_karluk: swish|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i mean i expect a swish|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 1@h AP|pg||
nt|npcjpn: what is the meaning is South doubles 2@d?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: prefer 2@H N natural and promising @D support for me|pg||
nt|kaz08833: I agree pass is percentage judge after pd's pass |pg||
nt|npcjpn: good @D or good hand with 3@h.|pg||
nt|kaz08833: the contract will be 3@d by NS|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: or 3@S by W|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: @C systems handle east's hand easily.  But if you're willing to open the correct 1@D, standard shouldn't have a huge problem, either.|pg||
nt|pelu: 5@d make but diff to bid|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our match in round 4 will be India v Sri Lanka (open)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I saw the opening bid in this hand in the OR where S opened NT x by W and I am here:)|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello all |pg||
mb|2H|nt|sharkey: *Multi|pg||
nt|lestergold: festering awful wouldnt do it myself at equal vul|pg||
nt|lestergold: here it might make e/w auction difficult|pg||
nt|sharkey: Can't be distributional values either....|pg||
nt|april7: then K of @S extracts last trum, should play @C to hand and the @H|pg||
nt|jaheim: 4 @D from Aabye ?|pg||
nt|april7: now 1NT pass pass pass |pg||
nt|davidstern: Not a fan of the pass by W - I would prefer to bid 2@C to let partner know I have values else I will be under pressure later|pg||
nt|rv: I presume Kushari-Laltu play 1n here to show 16-18, hence Laltu Xed instead of 1@s on account of much better @c suit |pg||
nt|mdgraham: there is a school of thought that 1N sandwich should simply be a strong NT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: given the dross people open and respond on these days |pg||
nt|frankaus: red V green its risky to geet too excited|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but in my book passed hand|pg||
nt|bucheister: brb|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 's 11 t/o x fine|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Ø dukker en @S og NS må ta beiten på direkten|pg||
nt|chick: it looked same to me, but we trust our operator :)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: E hates this hand!!|pg||
nt|davidstern: We likely have 50% + of the points and partner doesnt know it|pg||
nt|davidstern: 2@D by E???|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: will be by S|pg||
nt|pelu: oh - I didn't exp that|pg||
nt|rv: he should pass here, not enough to bid once more esp with some short suit values|pg||
nt|frankaus: red card will apper now|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: alas|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: but west has a monster over east's bidding so should go on|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh well im really getti9ng a full dose of commentatr's curse today|pg||
nt|sharkey: Whar would you bid Mike?|pg||
nt|lestergold: west's pass verylazy in my view and suicidal in a teams game|pg||
nt|lestergold: im 61 this month and feel about 18 mentally- er physically notm quite that|pg||
nt|baardolav: 2@d is a weak multi|pg||
nt|davidstern: Methinks too|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East might bid agin, but if he has bid his hand with double then he has a clear pass chez moi|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hi all|pg||
nt|h_karluk: would u x as E Ed?|pg||
nt|kaz08833: 3@s is very ill judge|pg||
nt|kastan88: why not 3@S from west?, or even 4s?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hi Shirley welcome|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaheim: K of cl and a claim?|pg||
nt|haans: Big Club at its best|pg||
nt|baardolav: this will make +2 or something|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if 2@d is a Multi, South can respond 2@h (pass/correct) or 2@S (pass/3@h). His hearts are good, could easily have bid 2@s   |pg||
nt|mdgraham: South with long hearts assumes his partner has spades :)|pg||
nt|baardolav: 2@s is natural not forcing in weak multi|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you can play it that way.|pg||
nt|npcjpn: wow! pass with void?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: At least they can take it 1 down|pg||
nt|iceblue: N misunderstood the DBL|pg||
nt|pelu: looks like NS is not so experient|pg||
nt|mdgraham: now 3@D from West?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the NT range is 14-17, most 14's and some 17's|pg||
nt|kastan88: but sure, there wasn't more  possibilities for West to bid after 2@D, as only 3NT|pg||
pc|s6|nt|lestergold: headed for game not making perhaps|pg||
nt|chick: this can make 4@H but not 5@C|pg||
nt|rnmalik: lesser evil and pass by E.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Pas probably limits the damage as any EW contract would be pretty expensive|pg||
nt|mcarroll: @S slam can make, but unlikely to be bid|pg||
nt|mcarroll: an aggressive lead which on this layout costs a trick|pg||
nt|rv: yes I agree Laltu should have 2 shown suits with more shape earlier with sandwitch NT or Mich or pass now|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 3@S seems a perfect making spot|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: no idea why South bothered to remove 1NT to 2D ..her hand looks "no-trumpy" to me|pg||
nt|djneill:  West hates to lead a worthless doubleton but more or less East is marked for 5 of them|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|haans: i have stopped bidding 4@H 30 years ago|pg||
nt|haans: support x better than delayed support|pg||
nt|npcjpn: may be great score in matchpoint.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: oh, North|pg||
nt|frankaus: saved|pg||
nt|iceblue: anyone agree with this DBL?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: not |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 4 makes on the trump hook|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: nor the choice of lead|pg||
nt|kastan88: ok, new board, I am too Post Mortimer :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello all welcome|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|lestergold: i would bid something - choice between 4n and 5H not easy but i would fera missing slam to much not to make a try|pg||
nt|sharkey: @CJ Jan Arne - and claim :)|pg||
nt|othered1: I personally prefer to use a 2@C rebid after 1@D opening to show a good hand. Gives you room to explore below 3N, at a cost on some natural auctions on lesser hands.|pg||
nt|chick: wow, I would never sell out with S's hand|pg||
nt|sharkey: shud be off 1|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello Hamdi  welcome |pg||
nt|h_karluk: all natural and i think 2@s would be a wise choice|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Hi Shirley , thanks|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: and while 2@S will play ok here, if it got a hideous trump break it would be way off|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|jaheim: mm  |pg||
nt|Walddk4: But 100 is not much compensation for a missed game|pg||
nt|mdgraham: how can double be anything but penalty?|pg||
nt|frankaus: N cant beleive pd pass a penn X with 3@S|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: same no tricks and -5 now|pg||
nt|djneill:  South has 1@c, 2@s, 4@h, and since West is long in @c South can cash a few|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: this can be -2 awful contract|pg||
pc|h2|nt|h_karluk: the difference now is @d4/3 but @s 5/2|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but i wld choose x as east with passed hand's 11 fine|pg||
nt|kaz08833: watching all hands we know EW can make even 4@s but I will surely pass 3@D with E's hand and gain small plus|pg||
pc|h5|nt|sharkey: Ø spiller @SK først - ofte "æerlig" fordeling da|pg||
nt|haans: was strong in KS|pg||
nt|haans: 2@C|pg||
nt|othered1: That's my preferred natural system :)|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|haans: @H lead much better than low spade|pg||
nt|npcjpn: dbl by West show @H and some @s?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But can they make 5@C?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: would u also pass as East Ice?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the 3N was weakish prepared to play game opp a weak major|pg||
pc|h4|nt|jaheim: mm   5 @D  -1|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5@d can lose spade heart and @d 3n very vulnerable too|pg||
nt|sharkey: Agree - think he shud fight with 3@H|pg||
nt|april7: depends on the play,W might lose 1 @S,1@H 2@D and 1 @C|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 5@D I mean|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I wonder if South put the spades down first....|pg||
nt|iceblue: yes, i would pass, since of RED :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: then most probably 1@h allowed, maybe same thing yr p wld think even with less hcp and 1@h would buy|pg||
nt|iceblue: how about 2@D xx?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: double part score = +6 Japan its teams|pg||
nt|kaz08833: this is a kind of "alarm clock".. if S had stiff @h S shd play @DA at trick one|pg||
nt|kaz08833: playing @DK denies stiff @H|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Macau I mean|pg||
nt|kastan88: after 1@S overcall and inviting 2@D (spade support) from East, I think EW never stopping before 3@S (if opps fighting with 3@D), but sure such decision is problem of style|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 7 imps thx Tommy|pg||
nt|kastan88: Myself i don't like such double with flat hand and 14 points after partner is passed, only troubles may happen  if partner has 8..9 points|pg||
nt|kastan88: as in this case: what must bid now West with 8 points?|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|frankaus: they have agreed @H so X cant be t/o|pg||
pc|c8|nt|jaheim: ja   og ender opp med 2 bet |pg||
nt|h_karluk: sounds a desire to play there, a tad ambitious|pg||
pc|c5|nt|npcjpn: on a club guess, I think.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: such things are good enough to save the say whenever there's a misfit and not big points|pg||
nt|djneill:  it's not that important to lead @c from dummy since South can only pick up Kxx onside for no losers (Kx or K can be picked up but are less likely)|pg||
pc|cK|nt|lestergold: perfectly reasonable as games make on dim finesse|pg||
nt|jaheim: needs a sp lead to win, i think|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n can make dpending on defence 5@d no play at all|pg||
nt|lestergold: except on spade lead|pg||
nt|rv: N-S not clear about their competitive methods, clearly evident from first 2 deals|pg||
nt|h_karluk: sorry, i meant to save the day|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome to John Bucheister |pg||
nt|bucheister: hi:  I am John Buchheister from the USA;, Michigan to be precise|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Hello John|pg||
nt|h_karluk: greetings from SC to MI, i hope printed yr state well|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|haans: :(|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Would you x NT after first x by W and pass by E?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: W showed the other two suits by x.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I think I would find the Pass, but I also think being aggressive is a winner in the long term|pg||
pc|c4|nt|lestergold: very little info from auction west has opted for non commital 'safe' trump lead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: however, they have also stopped at the two-level, so double is not needed as any sort of competitive effort|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c3|nt|lestergold: spade switch obvious but doesnt matter spade loser cannot go|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|mcarroll: AKx trumps lead would have made this a struggle for declarer|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: mm make 5 now|pg||
pc|h3|nt|davidstern: Four rounfs of hearts would have been best|pg||
nt|othered1: Meanwhile, 2@H is going to play nicely.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: in the other room for NZ we have Michael Ware (NZ top masterpoint winner of all time) with new pard GeO Tislevol ex Norway|pg||
pc|h7|nt|othered1: At least it simplified the auction.  In standard, south's planned rebid after opening 1@D isn't easy.|pg||
nt|april7: @H switch might cause  aproblem|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jaheim: minst|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|baardolav: you have to... else you will sit on 5-1 heart playing with 7-2 in spade|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good morning to Cornelia Yoder|pg||
nt|chick: Hello Everyone :)|pg||
nt|jaheim: HI|pg||
nt|djneill:  South is now ahead of the game, can take the tap in @d and still have enough trumps to handle West's 8|pg||
nt|djneill:  there is a danger that West gets in and gets to East who can cash a spade and promote the @h8|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: except they didn't establish the @S yet|pg||
nt|djneill:  but West has doubleton spade only so must underlead @dA|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|jaheim: ø i store problemer på neste hj|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and when you have vulnerable opps by the short and curlies (so to speak), you want to twist them  |pg||
nt|djneill:  nice job|pg||
nt|djneill:  twas risky, in case @h were 3-3, but half of that time East's 3rd @h wil be the @hK, a natural trick|pg||
pc|s5|nt|haans: biggest problem with 4@H is that you need 10 tricks|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi Cornelia|pg||
nt|kastan88: 8 points and 4-card @H, 2@H seems little bit weak for me (0...7 HCP)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|kiwibridge: Michael has his own system CRUNCH used to great effect at the top level in the Australian top teams events|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|sharkey: Skvisen kommer|pg||
nt|frankaus: turned a large plus into a wash |pg||
nt|Walddk4: This is the last match today. Tomorrow we have Sri Lanka v China, New Zealand v Chinese Taipei, and Singapore v Australia, all from the open series|pg||
nt|bucheister: Do NS play precision?|pg||
pc|h9|nt|kastan88: while bidding seems game on 4-3 hearts fit quite possible, but bad trump break just finishes that dream|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: NZ-CT that should be a cracker|pg||
nt|bucheister: hello everyone|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: there was a big earthquake in Christchurch at 4.30 this morning, 7.1 lots of damage but no reported deaths|pg||
pc|hK|nt|haans: holy ...|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Declare has 6 tricks and now setting up the 7th|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 3@S was meant as values with no good bid and that is what I think it should be|pg||

nt|rv: huge let-off for India here, couple of free-hits missed by SL:)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Lead of 10 of @C by N would have been interesting. |pg||
nt|djneill:  1NT at other table was more banal|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the @C switch was bad for the defence|pg||
pc|d3|nt|haans: nothing wrong with playing simple|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: yeah, C-T currently right up near the top|pg||
nt|bucheister: I lived thru one of those in LA; no fun at all|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: not sure of their system, the operators here tend not to alert anything|pg||
nt|kastan88: if partner is normally short in @S and with 4-card @H|pg||
pc|d6|nt|marlowepi: did S really rebid the diamonds all on his own?|pg||
nt|npcjpn: no @c discard?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Shui was not on that wavelength|pg||
nt|dslee: sorry folks back again|pg||

nt|chick: http://bridgefestival.no/modules.php?name=NukeWrap&page=http://bridgefestival.no/refresh.htm|pg||
nt|chick: not sure which table it is|pg||
nt|april7: 10 of @H was important|pg||
nt|xenya: 4@H turned out to be an unlucky choice it seems -- don't think 4@S EW is likely to make|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|djneill:  North's 1N was not forcing at the other table, and South found an interesting Pass|pg||
pc|hT|nt|haans: urkkkkkkkkkk|pg||
pc|h8|nt|othered1: If trumps had split less well, it would be playing a lot less nicely.|pg||
nt|bucheister: 2D doubled must have been systemic and I cannot understand the bid by S; EW had no where to go and no where to hide|pg||
nt|kastan88: Yamada-san, sure right, East cant bid more by LOTT, really, he had shown all|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jaheim: hm   no sidebets,  not even a beer in Lillehammer next year  :)|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|h6|nt|sybarra: this is not an easy hand to play in 4/3 |pg||
nt|h_karluk: yes, the auction went natural and somehow W neglected to pick 5/2 @s|pg||
pc|c9|pc|d8|nt|h_karluk: i believe E did his best to describe the hand|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: plus for NZ here|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: having missguessed what to do on the spade exit by Susan H, decl now in big trouble. EW would have liked their opps to be vully here  :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: this will be costly v OR|pg||
nt|sybarra: good pass and no X in the OR|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: was 4@h making|pg||
pc|cT|pc|dT|pc|dJ|nt|davidstern: so making 3 for a flat board|pg||
nt|sybarra: and the 5/2 would have played better esp. at the 2 level |pg||

pc|s8|pc|dA|nt|h_karluk: totally agreed|pg||

nt|othered1: Agree.  Getting there, however, is another story|pg||
mb|2H|an| |mb|p|nt|othered1: Agreement was re: 3N|pg||

nt|Walddk2: If they bid it|pg||
nt|psridhar: with both NS cue bidding that 4s is out now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe 2@H was a transfer advance, showing spades|pg||
nt|psridhar: Jonky might hv tried 2s over 2d being a pssed hand|pg||
nt|psridhar: passed hand|pg||
mb|r|mb|p|nt|patricck: hard for West to know they don't want partner to lead @H|pg||
nt|psridhar: however if S bids 3nt now, he is certain to get h lead|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|psridhar: well guessed Roland !|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|patricck: looks like Roland was right and 2@H showed @S|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|Walddk2: This is an intra-finesse position, is it not? You play for 10x with East|pg||
nt|patricck: yes|pg||
nt|psridhar: a variant yes|pg||
nt|othered1: Here it looks right to win and play @D to 8, 100 percent safe, but not very likely to be necessary on the auction|pg||

nt|jaheim: skulle tatt sine 6 toppstikk|pg||
nt|sharkey: Ja - mye lettere etterpå:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: my partner is not showing a weak hand in that auction|pg||
nt|jaheim: how many spades in W ?   prob 1|pg||
nt|lestergold: no game here for anyone|pg||
nt|haans: no simple enough|pg||
nt|haans: Soth should ave discarded S!J|pg||
nt|haans: @SJ|pg||
nt|haans: or played spades|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: open room|pg||
nt|jaheim: wow  sidebet from our operator   Thank you   Liv Marit  :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: How to gain 2 IMPs|pg||
nt|dslee: ahh|pg||
nt|frankaus: peter hall's book competative bidding at pairs has an excellent chapter on competative doubles - i highly recomend it|pg||
nt|bucheister: are they playing a club system?|pg||
nt|sybarra: I do not think so |pg||
nt|h_karluk: i am not sure, just joined and 1st time working abt their teams, but i guess after a few boards we'll reach the truth|pg||
nt|super nova: 6-5 keep it alive.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Slam time.|pg||
nt|othered1: South's pass, at least as I play it, would have been accepting 2@DXX.  That could be tense|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: indeed it was|pg||
nt|bucheister: not me|pg||
nt|djneill:  that was a cute hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznb: weak multi or strong|pg||
nt|haans: Voll right thats a weak 2|pg||
nt|chick: we all know better than to bet with you, Jan :)|pg||
nt|jaheim: :)|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: I prefer 2@S (spades and a minor, 6-10) to 1@S,here, but it is close, very close|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I think so Jaak, he's been playing with Matt McManus in the top Aussie events|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: so an unlucky -9 for a good sacrifice|pg||
nt|kastan88: another swing for Japan|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: may keep NS out of the cold @D slam|pg||
nt|april7: just 11 tricks possible, but depends on the lead and continuation|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 4@S with 10 or 11 tricks depending on the lead|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 11 on a diamond lead|pg||
nt|frankaus: takes the guesswork out of these situation|pg||
nt|bucheister: the meckwell two heart response is very useful on this type of hand|pg||
nt|rnmalik: What do we have from E, 2@H?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: coffee hand :)|pg||
nt|frankaus: g'day all|pg||
nt|bucheister: It looks like 4H would make; losing 1S;1H;1D|pg||
nt|djneill:  East has a 2@h mebbe?|pg||
nt|bucheister: push |pg||
mb|2H|nt|sharkey: Depends on what x of 2@D would mean|pg||
nt|jaheim: 1 nt 4 minors|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: 1NT is 8-15 p and at least 4-4 in @c and @d|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: greetings all|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello Gary, pleasant.|pg||
nt|super nova: Hello|pg||
nt|bucheister: that is right ED and very tense for EW|pg||
nt|kaz08833: LOTT tells E not to bid at 3-level but his @C holding breaks LOTT rules, thats why I dont blame 3@S by E|pg||
nt|kastan88: but brave wolf's breast is fat|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: welcome Frank|pg||
nt|kastan88: Hi Frank|pg||
nt|frankaus: zoltan is a gr8 declarer|pg||
nt|mathat: now part scor from N/S @D OR @S|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: some would call it an opening :)|pg||
nt|kastan88: precisionists always|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: in my day to open promised a rebid :)|pg||
mb|3D|nt|othered1: EW will find 4@S|pg||
nt|sybarra: there are 15 teams participating in the event|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes lol|pg||
nt|djneill:  mud still dripping from the 2@h card as he dredges it up|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well this slam wont be missed thats for sure|pg||
nt|othered1: South's double is interesting with that shape and not that many high cards|pg||
nt|haans: odd take out x|pg||
nt|henryb:  Going back to board one, where Lunna mysteriously took 12 tricks in 6N, shouldn't it be possible for big club players to reach 6@c?|pg||
nt|othered1: North has to act h ere and EW may find themselves defending a high @D contract|pg||
nt|haans: big clubs does anything :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: in board 1, Lunna got a diamond in the lead, and South was endplayed in spade|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I suppose it depends on what you open 2@d on - if you can do it with 5@h, then yes, 2@S natural makes sense |pg||
nt|davidstern: Spade partial ERW and Hearts or clubs NS|pg||
nt|pelu: I would never open in East - would u?|pg||
nt|sybarra: Singapore currently in 6th place|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I now have the Reid_Jacob system card thanks Nick :)|pg||
nt|djneill:  North in between|pg||
mb|3S|nt|haans: Kvarngraven 1st to think were are all the cards|pg||
nt|sybarra: at +17 imps|pg||
nt|h_karluk: http://www.bridgeguys.com/Conventions/MeckWellEscapes.html|pg||
nt|sybarra: Palestine, with -53 imps, is in 13th place, but there are several segments remaining and opportunities for plenty of movement in the standings|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaheim: ja   hadde gått 2 bet jeg|pg||
nt|jaheim: minst  :)|pg||
nt|jaheim: another slam coming up|pg||
nt|sharkey: 18-19|pg||
nt|lestergold: whether they bid the grand tho is open to question|pg||
nt|othered1: I might rebid @H on south's hand and I think it wins over the long term.|pg||
nt|haans: with u|pg||
nt|marlowepi: some would use stayman as N|pg||
nt|april7: should S open and N passes then E will come in in @H and then  perhaps 1,2,3 NT???|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Obviously the dealing machine is saving the games and slams for later in the tournament ...|pg||
nt|davidstern: Spade lead and heart off dummy would work well for declarer|pg||
nt|Walddk4: No|pg||
nt|pelu: give up: 4@s|pg||
nt|rv: E-W pair play rebid of 2M after 2/1 to be catch-all|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2NT forcing - very sensible|pg||
nt|rv: they play 2/1 as GF|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thx Rashed my friend and Hi Jamie :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: wanghong should pass to 2@h, whatever vulnerability she see|pg||
nt|npcjpn: not coffee hand, depends on a club guess.|pg||
nt|bucheister: Hi Shirley; I did not realize you had joined us|pg||
nt|kastan88: but how to stop now|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: q@H lead|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: prob a small @D|pg||
nt|kastan88: in this board disaster happened in OR for NS|pg||
nt|djneill:  what does East lead vs 4@s|pg||
nt|bucheister: Q of hearts; partner opened a vul 2 bid|pg||
nt|deltadash: thanks Gary and hi to everyone, so sorry to be late|pg||
mb|4S|nt|lestergold: hm that will tend to ruole out a heart contract|pg||
nt|sharkey: Kib asked why not open weak 2@H with S hand on Bd 17.  Reason is weak 2 openings 3rd hand NV can be very weak at Expert level, and this was closer to an opening hand.  Also a ...|pg||
nt|sharkey: matter of agreement|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Ah this may get them to the bad game|pg||
nt|frankaus: was the pd of Aust best player ever  (tim seres)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes, and another 6 to Australia on board 3 ambitious game failed OR|pg||
nt|kastan88: in right 3@C or 2/3@S|pg||
nt|kastan88: that is question|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: looks like -2|pg||
nt|mathat: 7 trics only take the A@S and retern Q@H|pg||
nt|kastan88: yes, even @D lead not helps|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: tror de fleste av oss hadde det|pg||
nt|jaheim: Viego in trbl,  but 1400 in the "bank"|pg||
nt|Walddk4: If you open with a sub-minimum in 3rd seat, fair enough, at least have a decent suit|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I dont know, but thought with 2@H bid by E, EW would be in 6@S.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i mean 2@d xx|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: interesting their 1N must have a 4 card major in it|pg||
nt|kastan88: Most problem for me, that can't find nowhere in internet participant CC's|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaheim: NS are playing in my local club|pg||
nt|lestergold: anymore and someone will be in tgrouble|pg||
nt|haans: ty Liv needed that info|pg||
nt|henryb:  Did South really have to act over 1@s Hans?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think many of us would begin with 1@D as W dealer|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Seres is a legend|pg||
nt|frankaus: david lilley played many years with ron klinger|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: 7@C makes|pg||
nt|chick: I think that hand is much too strong for a preempt|pg||
nt|mdgraham: dbl looks like DONT  - six card suit somewhere. Bit thin if it is|pg||
nt|npcjpn: there are many players who does not like pass in 3rd seat even vulnerable (in Japan).|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I blame Henri for this one, NOT a vul opener|pg||
nt|bucheister: hi Diane|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: welcome Diane Siebert glad to have you|pg||
nt|djneill:  running scores:  event:http://www.bridgeunlimited.com/bridge/DisplayResultsT4?club_event_id=15508&header=pabf&fdc=KDFFAJVDG|pg||
pc|cK|nt|april7: I don't think W should pass 1@D, has 5 P!!! and then 4@H would have been reached making 5 if starts with @S finesse but 10 tricks for sure|pg||
nt|april7: down from top on @S lead|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I would rather open 1@H if you forced me to open|pg||
nt|npcjpn: me too.|pg||
nt|pelu: pest and colera :)|pg||
nt|kastan88: it's possible to win 6@D on EW-line, another is to bid that, and sure, need to find good break in trumps and right finesse in spades, too much key-cards off to bid that|pg||
nt|super nova: I dont like to bid micheals with 'intermediate' hands. because they can be hard to describe.|pg||
nt|kaz08833: or depends on defense.. the problem is when EW find @D shift|pg||
nt|djneill:  http://www.bridgeunlimited.com/bridge/DisplayResultsT4?club_event_id=15508&header=pabf&fdc=KDFFAJVDG|pg||

nt|djneill:  welcome diane|pg||
nt|bucheister: best lead:)|pg||
nt|deltadash: Hi Dan :)|pg||
nt|djneill:  do not foresee the overtrick at this table, in fact we'll have to see some magic in the trump suit|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the online interactive scoring is great|pg||
pc|c5|nt|sharkey: Gjetter spillet går ut|pg||
nt|haans: nope|pg||
nt|chick: If I get support for either suit, I don't play a 6-5 hand below game|pg||
nt|bucheister: 4H seems to be an impatient bid; don't you agree?|pg||
nt|bucheister: prbably take 8 tricks on defense|pg||
nt|h_karluk: it wld b a nightmare for EW|pg||
nt|iceblue: sun bids 4@S directly after 2NT better|pg||
nt|kastan88: may be somewhere in older tournament archives...|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: RDK one of the all time greats also|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: lol I welcomed Shirley earlier John :)|pg||
nt|kastan88: after 1@S-1NT-2@D IMO South had to bid 3@D of course, not pass|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: E has done well to remain silent here|pg||
nt|bucheister: this should beat it|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|lestergold: 7N has 13 tops |pg||
nt|lestergold: n /s in trouble !|pg||
nt|haans: to good effect|pg||
nt|pelu: can West pass?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: one of the legacies of the old Acol system was that 2NT here was not forcing|pg||
nt|rv: Kushari will sign-off in 3N to limit hand|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/25udavr  for running scores |pg||
nt|sybarra: seems so John |pg||
nt|h_karluk: absolutely, even i can tell misunderstanding of fast arrival concept|pg||
nt|bucheister: if E bids 2D, W will bid 3D and E can bid 3NT|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i guess A count, K attitude there|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so the defenders would have no difficulty to cash 2@d, 1@c and a trump|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but let's wait and see, who knows there may be a slip in defense|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: it's so loose these days results are pretty random|pg||
nt|kastan88: seems so that precisionists must revise their openings :)|pg||
nt|kastan88: but naturalists in other room raised up to 5@C, same bad|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|frankaus: scoring looks to be done by martin wilcox cheif scorer for ABF |pg||
nt|dslee: now laltu might force a round?|pg||
nt|bucheister: I went to get some liquid refreshment and missed it|pg||
nt|djneill:  West plays the @cJ as suit preference or to show the @cT?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: shows 10 for me|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jaheim: y   but no D   |pg||
nt|mdgraham: ok, we don't want 1100|pg||
nt|baardolav: no one can ask for aces...|pg||
nt|pelu: plauge or colera, sorry :)|pg||
nt|pelu: plague - new keyboard :(:(|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this was because when someone opened the bidding, you could never be certain that they had an opening bid|pg||
nt|super nova: I like to stick with Weak or Strong Micheal and bid the medium hands naturally.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: it's not even a great suit, but good for bidding later|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: can he slip this one thru|pg||
nt|kastan88: probably in OR was right to bid 3@C not 4@C from South, if take that 2@H (4th suit) was GF|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jaheim: her måtte sp K ut|pg||
nt|jaheim: y   13 toptricks,  with 2 sptricks|pg||
nt|haans: dirty bridge|pg||
nt|bucheister: made us all wonder?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the auction was tortuous what was W looking for?|pg||
nt|bucheister: unless magic in the spade suit|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mcarroll: I tend to agree|pg||
nt|rv: Laltu's 4N is Quant|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh my,  made 4 in other room |pg||
nt|h_karluk: unfortunately true|pg||
nt|sybarra: south cashed a @D, then led a hts |pg||
nt|h_karluk: why i do not have such defenders, i think i am a jealous guy :)|pg||
nt|iceblue: @DQ is the killing lead|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so far so good layout|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and the lead friendly neighbor, no worries|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|lestergold: 7N is technically better as well because if clubs broke badly you would have the spade position to fall back on|pg||
nt|sharkey: 7@S depending on the @S finesse|pg||
nt|april7: but after ruff S is endplayed|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so you had to have lots of bids that acted as invites. Partner bid on if he really did have an opening bid, and passed otherwise|pg||
nt|rv: Kushari would have accepted Inv to slam with max (13-14) for his stated minimum (10-14)|pg||
nt|kaz08833: now the time to @D shift but it's rather tough|pg||
nt|kastan88: now will work signals for defense, how good they are|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: right I concede @C guess :( sorry|pg||
nt|bucheister: 1nt-3nt|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: he has|pg||
nt|kastan88: may be then c can stop, but sure in vuln you just lose game, if play 3NT from North with heart lead and hearts 44|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: what an effort appluase Manoppo|pg||
nt|deltadash: me 2|pg||
pc|h6|nt|haans: would have gone on if after 2nt invite|pg||
nt|haans: bridge not like all time|pg||
nt|haans: old|pg||
nt|mcarroll: The last thing Declarer will do is lead trumps, has to try for a semi-crossruff in the red suits|pg||
nt|mdgraham: important to know what these doubles are. After the redouble, penalty is a live possibility|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: EW not agree about bidding|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: back later .. bye all|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: this 3@S figures to fail also|pg||
nt|kastan88: immediate diamond play now, expassing later @DA|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mcarroll: well stopped|pg||
nt|baardolav: or south can not...|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: it is precision I'm told|pg||
nt|kastan88: more IMPs to Japan, 11 this time|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jaheim: tull   kl Q er jo inntak  :(|pg||
nt|lestergold: funnt south doubles and east can probably manage 3@s they bid on to hopeless 4@d and let off hook|pg||
nt|othered1: right, south has a quite sound opening|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|jaheim: y   think cl is trumph|pg||
nt|sharkey: The @S suit has not been mentioned so a mute point|pg||
nt|lestergold: well bid at any raTE ITS GOOD ENUF AT IMPS|pg||
nt|mdgraham: maybe West didn't believe East could have a penalty double of 2@H when he held @HKJ|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Now only 10, no entry to dummy to take the diamond finesse when spades are 3-1|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Declarer got a diamond lead in the other room|pg||
nt|kaz08833: E chose safe defense but lost plus score|pg||
nt|npcjpn: now time for buying a cup of coffee.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: to clarify: the NT must have a 4 card major IF if the lower range|pg||
nt|kastan88: small @D to J|pg||
nt|djneill:  the @sQT/@sKT with East is twice as likely as KQ tight with West (impossible for East to have @sKQ on this auciton and @cK lead)|pg||
pc|s6|nt|sharkey: Wonder what wud happen if Jensen opened Multi 2@D here (ref previous board)|pg||
nt|deltadash: how DO you play the @s suit guys?|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|henryb:  I thought this was perhaps a Scandinavian requirement: see 11HCP, Pass not allowed :)|pg||
nt|othered1: Is that tap enough to beat it?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: forcing defense there, early ruffed|pg||
nt|h_karluk: counting|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: but NZ +4 on board 3|pg||

pc|s2|pc|s3|pg||
nt|haans: greast lover of T and 9|pg||
nt|sharkey: 4@H a make here?|pg||
nt|npcjpn: East in the other room also opened!|pg||
nt|super nova: Hard to describe in terms of playing tricks.|pg||
nt|kastan88: if @H8, was switch to somewhere... probably East could switch to dia|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: now J smothers 10 nice|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|lestergold: i do not understand my pard vul opens bidding i sit over strong hand with that trump holding they at 4 level im sorry folks i wer bring out a red card pdq|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Alright the other route is x 1@H and make 6.|pg||
nt|xenya: @S lead looked reasonable -- and would have been a killer|pg||
pc|s7|nt|mcarroll: best defence is to continue trumps but not easy from K9|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: W did jump to game, E could make a move|pg||
nt|rnmalik: or bid 1@S and @D later on........................|pg||
nt|h_karluk: no way to set it|pg||
pc|c6|nt|rv: Indian team playing in the event, won the trials to represent India in Commonwealth Bridge Champs at New Delhi later this year, they got a bonus event in first Asian bridge Champs ...|pg||

nt|baardolav: pluss 1|pg||
nt|april7: @C would be better,because E might have 3@C|pg||
nt|h_karluk: only @dQ as ice described|pg||
nt|iceblue: dummy would be SQZed|pg||
nt|iceblue: seems -1 now|pg||
nt|othered1: but north can't make it from here|pg||
nt|iceblue: Sun Shud have played @SQ 1st instead of @SA|pg||
nt|h_karluk: just touch diamonds and hope spiit honors|pg||
pc|s4|nt|haans: waited for that|pg||

nt|deltadash: very nicely done|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lestergold: is there a law against it|pg||
pc|d7|nt|othered1: why @S pitch and not @D on their @C?  If no trump shift, then crossruff high|pg||
nt|kastan88: this time spade lead would take down, but usually I don't like such lead from poor doubleton into dummy's suit|pg||
nt|othered1: still time to tap declarer with another @C|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|sharkey: Moysian fit|pg||
nt|npcjpn: 7 tricks for push.|pg||

nt|Walddk2: I was focusing on the more likely 3-2 break|pg||
mb|1N|mb|2S|nt|othered1: I wonder if NS have methods to play this in @D?|pg||
nt|patricck: singleton 10 unlikely because West might have doubled with @SKQxx @HQx, or at least thought of it|pg||

nt|othered1: That, too|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|psridhar: yes true; didnt notice the 3-0 break in dia|pg||

nt|sharkey: dont think they've been at the rubber bridge table too often :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: i gain a lot more than i lose by doubling|pg||
nt|lestergold: last hand was a stand on the chair double|pg||
nt|henryb:  Not the best result for E-W, as 4@s is easy|pg||
nt|haans: agree :)|pg||
nt|chick: 4@H might make, but I sure wouldn't be happy in it|pg||
nt|chick: of course I'm famous for detesting moysians :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: :) - dont think 4@H makes either - tapped in @S |pg||
nt|haans: but IMP so who cares :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in a short match overtricks sometimes matter|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: it was 8 tricks|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: but went quite fast in the end, so don't know exactly how|pg||
nt|haans: no good bid for E|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 1D seems fine to me|pg||
nt|chick: again, too good for a preempt|pg||
nt|haans: "Not for person below 100"|pg||
nt|mcarroll: now making all his small trumps with the crossruff - contract making|pg||
nt|april7: 3@H p  p  X  p 4@S|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Sound reasonable to me|pg||
nt|april7: on @H lead then 5,on @D ace lead only 4,but bidding might develop differently|pg||
nt|chick: would you jump to game with N's hand over 3@H P P X?  partner is under pressure and doesn't have to have 20 pts for a X|pg||
nt|april7: you are right, but even over 3@S S will bid 4, but thats a different story|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It was somewhat dangerous cash that last trump and then @DA and king|pg||
nt|super nova: W may also consider 4h good raise ?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that was the logical line|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: action hand possibly|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: some long suits here|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: and what devastation for the morale of Masood|pg||
nt|bucheister: since you can pick up Q or K 10 fourth for one loser in the E hand I would guess that the spade ace is technically best but with the auction probably not reseachable|pg||
nt|bucheister: reasonable|pg||
nt|djneill:  that sounds right john|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|april7: N might reopen with a X, then S might reach qa @H contract at 3 level, but EW might compete to 3 @S|pg||

nt|npcjpn: can NS stop?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: from -12 to +1|pg||

nt|haans: kib: ihj: Koppang - Olsen are both seniors|pg||
nt|april7: now perhaps 2@H nonforcing?|pg||
nt|chick: sure, I would have guessed   3@H P P X P 3@S P 4@S|pg||
nt|rnmalik: In the OR W opened 1@S and after that 6 was not a problem, previous hand.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 1@h and?|pg||
nt|othered1: Any thoughts on what EW were playing for on last hand?|pg||
nt|frankaus: red V green preempt  - pd expects good values|pg||
nt|bucheister: good lead; good play|pg||
nt|djneill:  ok East opens a weak NT, South delivers the axe|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: not sure of their escape methods|pg||
nt|djneill:  West has no way to communicate the void - East may have complete wastage, or game could be cold|pg||
nt|djneill:  here, minimum (assume) with wasted @d's|pg||
mb|2S|nt|haans: do like 2@S|pg||
nt|jaheim: right|pg||

nt|mdgraham: hmm 1NT|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I don't like 11 point openers when vul|pg||
nt|kaz08833: NS in the open room went astray and bid 6@C|pg||
nt|bucheister: did patrick cheat or is their nt that weak?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 12-15 in Prec I believe|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: form theirmn gross overbidding|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: 1NT = 8-12, at least 4-4 in @h and @s|pg||
nt|jaheim: weak with majors, if i dont remember wrong|pg||
nt|haans: for first time ever(?) can we see that they have no sceens|pg||
nt|haans: Lunna right no opening|pg||
nt|sharkey: Kib points out 5@C makes though|pg||
nt|marlowepi: is it intermediate?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Nancy shld go on with @cK|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Hva gjør V?|pg||
nt|jaheim: spar eller ru tro   |pg||
nt|jaheim: hadde meldt rutern jeg|pg||
nt|sharkey: 6@D mulig?|pg||
nt|sharkey: Plutselig har Ø et "monster" - så lenge pd ikke har meldt av 3 korts farge|pg||
nt|jaheim: men på 2 trinnet,   3 ru er 5 kort imo|pg||
nt|jaheim: D  =  3 @H|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Surely 4@H is the bid|pg||
nt|h_karluk: a simple 2@h rebid expected |pg||
nt|npcjpn: Even 4NT may be too high with a bad club break.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: and gets them |pg||
nt|frankaus: even Zoltans hand a bit light 4 me|pg||
nt|deltadash: I think he was paying attention to the vulnerability|pg||
nt|djneill:  hmm, North may be afraid of pushing E-W into game, otherwise, can use Leb maybe to get to 3@d|pg||
nt|djneill:  South has no call, North on lead with the... @d?|pg||
nt|bucheister: opposite a strong hand she had to bid|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Spørs hvilke krav meldinger de har til rådighet - hvis 2 NT krav viser farge|pg||
nt|othered1: 3N migh be best on this on NS cards alone, but @H more likely to be found.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: not 2|pg||
nt|chick: moot now as W elected to treat his hand as an opening bid|pg||
nt|npcjpn: it will be tough not leading a spade.|pg||
nt|frankaus: some would open North hand|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but preferred a jump rebid, i guess was useless, slow approach would produce a better way to see what partner have|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: nice swing to the kiwis|pg||
nt|rnmalik: :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: she had Kx while cut with @dK|pg||
nt|bucheister: anyone else like 2H|pg||
nt|iceblue: yes, i bid 2@H after dbl|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: guess not|pg||
nt|djneill:  West may try ducking @c twice, knowing South has the @cA for the double when South shows the @dA and not @dK|pg||
pc|hT|nt|sharkey: Good bid by Kvangraven|pg||
nt|lestergold: no lead to beat|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3N|pg||
nt|sharkey: S unsure about @C suit?|pg||
nt|lestergold: south may be tempted to play this in hearts|pg||
nt|jaheim: or lucky, finding p with 10 of @S|pg||
nt|lestergold: if so three rounds of spades with the 9@h ruffing in would not be nice|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4S seems makeable on trump coup|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Henri should have no probs here|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: lol not really|pg||
nt|bucheister: those part score swings with kill you|pg||
nt|deltadash: every time John|pg||
nt|djneill:  can this make?|pg||
nt|bucheister: 3|pg||
nt|djneill:  only makes if South covers or cashes the @dA and North gets red-suit squeezed|pg||
nt|djneill:  doesn't South get 2@s, 3@c?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|sharkey: may be even 6...|pg||
nt|henryb:  I would prefer 1@s, but ..|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi henry:)|pg||
nt|henryb:  Hi|pg||
nt|haans: Henry :)|pg||
nt|haans: no alert of 2nt?|pg||
nt|henryb:  1@s would seem to have the advantage that it leaves more room, and your hand is better than a weak jump overcall|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: 2NT was bid as good-bad, but W is not sure. TD at the table|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: 2NT was not alerted|pg||
nt|haans: can be costly|pg||
nt|henryb:  on either side?|pg||
nt|haans: for EW|pg||
nt|henryb:  the alet I mean?|pg||
nt|baardolav: they did not play that hand...|pg||
nt|april7: N did not reopen|pg||
nt|chick: now, S has shown his 20 with a X then cuebid|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if 2@c asks for a four-card major, West should reply 2@D|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, but i don't think a passive lead was indicated on the auction|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hard trump suit to play|pg||
pc|h7|nt|chick: on the  lead of @CA and a @C?|pg||
nt|sharkey: 500 if axed|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/2b44yyj  for results and standings after round 7|pg||
nt|rv: hand is too strong for 1n in my opiniom, I expect Rubens-Kaplan calculator to indicate atleast  18 hcp for West hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: off to the races is my guess |pg||
nt|bucheister: N really bid the spots off those cards|pg||
nt|othered1: withthe west hand?  Depends on agreed style.|pg||
nt|kastan88: for me last hand signalling easy: odd (@H7) says come on with hearts; even high (@H8) says: switch to hearts, even small (@H2) switch to clubs. But sure you always have not such ...|pg||

nt|baardolav: the biddings i mean?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Ms Kobayashi likes to open light it seems|pg||
nt|mdgraham: as he hasn't got a four-card major|pg||
nt|kastan88: 4@S for EW (and best is to play that from West hand). Now after @H lead just disaster|pg||
nt|h_karluk: now now|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: N trying to escape from the hole he created|pg||
nt|kaz08833: NS have only 9 top tricks and make much efforts to take 10th|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: superb player Martin is even this may test him|pg||
nt|kastan88: hmm, isn't 3@C forcing here? IMO 4@H too fast|pg||

nt|npcjpn: I do not play against this pair so often, so I don't know their style.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: dangerous seas for NS|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Steph should make this without much trouble|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: she'll worry that if the trump King is offside, she is in danger of going off (@D ruff)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes but no choice of trump play|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: she also has a lot of losers to 'do' something with. Throw them on spades, looks appealing.. but entries and maintaining control are important|pg||
pc|s6|nt|lestergold: 9 claimable immediate tricks|pg||
nt|sharkey: In my view an awful convention - tell opps your distribution|pg||
nt|haans: no alert = good hand = 3@S good bid = missed game|pg||
nt|h_karluk: not an easy grand decision but its there|pg||
nt|bucheister: should be able to pass 1nt opposite a passed hand with the S cards|pg||
nt|sybarra: and a good stop here also|pg||
nt|bucheister: you are so right|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: in practise I don't see it making but -1 is fine -2 still an imp|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|jaheim: men meds gammelmakkern som sitter på hjørnet hadde det nok blitt 2 kl|pg||
nt|frankaus: too stong 4 me |pg||
nt|mdgraham: imho, 1NT is a complete distortion|pg||

nt|mdgraham: yes|pg||
nt|sybarra: grand doesnt make on the lay out |pg||
nt|frankaus: they must be playing michaels = anty strenght|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: flat 30's very seldom make 12 tricks ergo necessary to have full opening values when vul|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: chance to duck|pg||

nt|iceblue: 2NT=choose minors pls|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 6 direct winners at 2N defense|pg||
nt|kastan88: and of course playing with spot trumps showing is that signal real (high trump spot 1st if possible)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes better, lucky here to escape a minor suit lead|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jaheim: looks like im loosing my sidebet,  Liv Marit|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: :)|pg||
nt|bucheister: It will make but 6NT is much better|pg||
nt|h_karluk: kind of double dummy, @c K hook onside|pg||
nt|bucheister: partner is a passed hand and you are NV with no defense outside hearts; sounds like a 2H bid|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lestergold: a lot ofm tricks here for declarfer|pg||
nt|frankaus: 36 zars = 18 HCP|pg||
nt|frankaus: many do these days|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the sight of dummy won't bring joy, helpful sort of lead|pg||
nt|kastan88: and need to ruff out @D too, 3rd H promoting long spades in East hand, and if repeat now heart, no more entries to hand|pg||
pc|h4|nt|sharkey: Med @S 3-3 ordner det seg i den fargen|pg||

pc|s7|nt|bucheister: well it is 13-10 and this is not Meckwell|pg||
pc|s2|nt|rv: yes I expected hand eval closer to 18 hcp |pg||
nt|iceblue: but i doubt if Sun thinks so too|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 11 points is NOT a vul opener unless partner won't go mad|pg||
pc|sK|nt|jaheim: or 1400|pg||

nt|frankaus: 6 losers 1 too many for my agreements|pg||

nt|lestergold: i suppose can afford it|pg||
nt|sharkey: @C lead beats it I think|pg||
nt|chick: seems like a good way to tell the opponents your distribution|pg||

nt|kiwi_joker: yes, got the doubleton heart lead from South and play was a breeze|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 3 more NZ on board 4|pg||
nt|djneill:  was North falsecarding with the @s spot, West wondering|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: though would run that|pg||
nt|deltadash: hmmmmmmmm|pg||
nt|djneill:  ok the @h return broke up the transportation for the squeeze|pg||
pc|h6|nt|lestergold: ten tricks then|pg||
nt|kastan88: but still ruins, if North continuing @D|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|pelu: @H8 and @C to K would be a very nice defense|pg||
nt|xenya: E's raise to 4 looks overaggressive to me -- considering his diamond holding|pg||
nt|frankaus: either E or W has oversreatched|pg||
nt|kastan88: need 3rd @H|pg||
pc|h8|nt|bucheister: if he had played a lower spade S might have felt endplayed|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes, the nightmare scenario for declarer is if the EW @Cs were reversed|pg||
nt|mdgraham: even with diamonds coming in, North has only eight tricks, and entries are a problem|pg||
nt|h_karluk: their 9 cards @c fit masked|pg||
nt|djneill:  @c here would finish it off quickly|pg||
nt|deltadash: good point John|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c2|nt|lestergold: agree it seems pretty ugly to me|pg||
nt|h_karluk: would make own hand good|pg||
nt|xenya: or both|pg||
nt|djneill:  North is a great partner!|pg||
pc|cT|nt|kiwibridge: pitch Q@C then home|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|lestergold: even more tricks goodbye ak @s|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so close to LBW, but let off by the umpire|pg||
nt|bucheister: good to try and preempt over the 1D opening; they lose the minors|pg||
nt|iceblue: W why not plas 2NT?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: they ll cash a @s and a @d|pg||
nt|othered1: Note that they lost th em anyway, despite the 1@H overcall|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Nice. Nothing can beat her now.|pg||
pc|c4|nt|sharkey: or 12|pg||

nt|bucheister: time to claim 6;|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and i am very sorry, right now checked again, @h 10xxx a barrier for grand|pg||
nt|rnmalik: W should make 8 tricks.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but not doubled|pg||

mb|2C|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h2|nt|othered1: Drury.  You need good methods to get to 4@H here.  And North seems to have wanted to keep EW as much in the dark about the hand as possible|pg||
nt|psridhar: 2 stiffs persuaded drury and leap to 4s |pg||

nt|sharkey: In 7 board matches overtricks often significant in score|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6@c avaialble as cards liem 3n no good|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5@c is what i meant to type|pg||
nt|sharkey: or 4@S|pg||
nt|lestergold: that too but game unlikely to be bid in either back suit|pg||
nt|sharkey: 4@S may actually be a better contract|pg||
nt|lestergold: both comntractsb less than 50% no real reason to justify bidding game here|pg||
nt|henryb:  down 2?????????|pg||
nt|haans: will EW try slam|pg||
nt|haans: none at the table :)|pg||
nt|haans: so who are playing?|pg||
nt|henryb:  As a matter of pride now: @cQ to K, @c ruff, @h to Q, @c ruff, @h to A and claim|pg||
nt|haans: webcam off|pg||
nt|april7: 6@D possible if finding right play in @D|pg||
nt|april7: ace was @D was very wrong!!!|pg||
nt|jaheim: hm   dident matter  4@H  was laydown   NS,   wasnt it?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hard to see anything except a flat board here|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Lots of bidding in OR|pg||
nt|rnmalik: action hand.|pg||
nt|othered1: And it avoids insulting the opponents . .. |pg||
nt|bucheister: nothing wrong with 3H for sure!|pg||
nt|kaz08833: @H guess is easy at that time ... because W discarded @D.. he cannot have 5-card suit|pg||
nt|Walddk4: No, but   xxxx   Jx   so it was not a sure thing|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: claimed 7 accepted strange|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: good try what will it cost|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: however it did make which is a plus|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: EW each with 2 winners|pg||
nt|bucheister: the club K or A would certainly worked more effectively|pg||
nt|djneill:  North did compete in the other room, reasonably, to win a few IMPs|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: still 2 imps in|pg||
nt|djneill:  similar start but North bid the shape|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaheim: snei    alle lagturneringene har vært trege fra begynnelsen i år|pg||
nt|lestergold: another frigid 3n thx to favourable layout of @d suit|pg||
nt|sharkey: On previous hand it took a @D lead to set 4@S|pg||
nt|mcarroll: or 6NT|pg||
nt|april7: same with 6NT|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Tsukamoto knows what to expext by now; partner has 10-12 points when she opens|pg||
nt|pelu: good play for 4@h on small values|pg||
nt|frankaus: 6 is ok Red V red, but i like 5 for 3 level preempt red V green|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: but still a loss as X'd in OR|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes the 2@C on Q2 was a cunning trick|pg||
nt|kastan88: 6 IMPs back to Indonesia, they needed that|pg||
nt|bucheister: still an interesting spade play by W|pg||
nt|djneill:  North's @s6 was the highest spot, if a true card, could not help much to hook|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznb: 1 down in last board|pg||
nt|haans: :) |pg||
nt|henryb:  what I thought|pg||
nt|mcarroll: If they reach slam there is no real alternative to the @D finesse|pg||

nt|Walddk4: What would you bid now, guys?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaheim: snei   = nei   :)|pg||

nt|Walddk4: 2@H, 2@D, double?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: What do you prefer?|pg||
nt|dslee: rather easy one for EW|pg||
nt|super nova: 1nt comic here would work really well for Gibbons|pg||
nt|super nova: 1nt = Strong balanced hand or any weak 2.|pg||

nt|haans: 3@D less likely suits are 4333|pg||
nt|haans: 2@S GF|pg||
nt|bucheister: same result |pg||
nt|h_karluk: lets check clues, wang might have max. 3@h, no 5 sp, then max 4@s and 10-15 unbal. might have 2@d and long @c, so why not 3@c free bid by Sun, i think it worths when Wang opened|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: S wades into the minefield|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: same contract 1 more light 2 more imps NZ|pg||
mb|p|nt|npcjpn: 4@s looks best.|pg||
nt|npcjpn: how about 2NT? any strong two suiter.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Not easy|pg||
nt|frankaus: i like 3 card raise over 1@S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: certainly now - the odds on @DK being right just went up|pg||
nt|sybarra: nice of H!'s to be 3/3 here |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: a steady set of wee gains 1 1 4 3 2|pg||
nt|kastan88: and same bidding sequence was, they don't like minor contracts, seems|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 4@H is making here|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 5@D -2|pg||
nt|kastan88: is West hand worth the raise?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: C-T have done well here in OR|pg||
nt|djneill:  South has a nice hand for @s|pg||
mb|2C|nt|haans: three card raise rarer and rarer|pg||
nt|chick: three card raise should be extinct|pg||
nt|chick: :)|pg||
nt|npcjpn: though this hand is not so strong.|pg||
nt|sybarra: now looks like a club system for n/s|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: never find 6@D now|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: yes -on review think 5@C better|pg||
nt|lestergold: i do not like east's double tend to get into troubole when u faikl to bid ur main asset namely clubs here|pg||
nt|april7: is N considering a X???|pg||
nt|mcarroll: That is a very sporting 2@S|pg||
nt|april7: thats why it will cost a lot|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 2@H by S - surely not|pg||
nt|frankaus: well places should they try 4@S|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: boom explodes|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Martin thinks so|pg||
nt|frankaus: North very "round" for pushing on|pg||
nt|bucheister: well a good player would always false card in that seat; even with the 102|pg||
mb|4S|nt|rnmalik: Good score in the OR.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: identical auction so far|pg||
nt|jaheim: prob   2 @C|pg||
nt|mcarroll: OK not natural|pg||
nt|mathat: 3 NT lead J@s -2|pg||
nt|twcho: Think that Lasut will find the @s lead|pg||
nt|twcho: judging from his hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  West has, imo, a marginal game force.|pg||
nt|haans: OR in 5@S|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi Mike, all|pg||
nt|mcarroll: and with 3 tricks N expects something from pd - He will be disappointed!!|pg||
nt|jaheim: Viego in trbl  now|pg||
nt|davidstern: 2NT by South 3@S by North now |pg||
nt|pelu: a lot of bidding here - 60 HCP in this board? :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: No matter what, 2@H worked like a dream|pg||
nt|rv: this event is played like erstwhile European Open Teams Champs, 18 rounds amongst 19 teams with winner of RR winning the event|pg||
nt|sybarra: @H's 3/3|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our next match is New Zealand v Korea (women)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 2or 3 @H|pg||
nt|bucheister: how many of the specs out there open 2H with the s hand|pg||
nt|twcho: Bingo|pg||
nt|twcho: Indonesia has an easy schedule for the final few rounds and they are favorites to win the Championship|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: they will surely cash @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: now will bid|pg||
nt|haans: yes if no agreement|pg||
nt|mcarroll: and they seem set to bid it the same way here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/2b44yyj  for results and standings after round 9 of 14|pg||
nt|mcarroll: But  6@C seems like a leap in the dark|pg||
nt|april7: N really has not enough to X!!!!|pg||
nt|npcjpn: true.|pg||
nt|pelu: 4@S down 1?|pg||
nt|sybarra: may land in 3 nt also |pg||
nt|bucheister: I am surprised that S did not bid 3C asking on this hand;  it is the key to a club slam|pg||
nt|h_karluk: !K offside, seems either 3N by N or 4@h by S|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @Sk|pg||
nt|kaz08833: unfortunate 2@Dx|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: time for West to joke'. "sorry pard, guess we underbid it"  :-)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: S commits to 5@D|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: for an imp|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: and as u say it may well go off |pg||
nt|sharkey: @DA lead OR|pg||
nt|sharkey: Made it easy for declarer|pg||
nt|lestergold: sure|pg||
nt|lestergold: is east that stromngb that a doubolem is needed before showing the clubs/|pg||
nt|haans: many play 2nt as invite or more|pg||
nt|haans: many scandinavians at least|pg||
nt|sharkey: 3@D - 3 NT|pg||
nt|mcarroll: OK Natural :)|pg||
nt|npcjpn: or 3@c by North and 3@s by South.|pg||
nt|davidstern: 6@C would be a good spot|pg||
nt|npcjpn: if you open light, you have to be lucky.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: would you bid 2@D in S?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but sun might pick a moysian fit idea with her x|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jaheim: 2 hj med 4 kortstøtte,  ja ja, ikke min melding|pg||
nt|sharkey: if East were ready to bid 4@C on 3@D he shud be able to do the same over 2@H|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Hi Martin. |pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@d South African transfer to 4@S....|pg||
nt|xenya: N is worth 3@S now i think|pg||
nt|xenya: but...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 3@h invites auto x|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but nobody dared|pg||
nt|npcjpn: not so bad if EW in the other room makes 4@H.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: may not even X|pg||
nt|frankaus: this will not be pretty|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: this can go -4 not a great dive|pg||
nt|djneill:  2@c an ART limit raise of some kind|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mcarroll: Hardly|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South really playing with fire here. You suspect 3@s would have been passed out|pg||
nt|jaheim: D   is @H lead|pg||
nt|davidstern: It seems the NS style may be to support immediately with 3 spades but I suspect that the bidding is consistent with 3 spades and six clubs perhaps|pg||
nt|h_karluk: however slam, no heart losers, only a club loser|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: very true, but 2@D with those @S's was a real crime|pg||
pc|h6|nt|lestergold: combined 24 points doesnt have to bid game|pg||
nt|jaheim: mm   1 nt opening in W|pg||
nt|chick: at least S didn't draw the fatal (to defenders) club lead by bidding them|pg||
nt|chick: now can N find a heart?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Well Leaped|pg||
nt|rnmalik: agree.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 11 easy tricks with hearts 3-2|pg||
nt|rnmalik: or 3 as suggested by a kib.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: not vul and good lead directing|pg||
nt|super nova: I wouldnt bid 2@d as south.|pg||
nt|kastan88: brave Martin will give that?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: is pass forcing|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|henryb:  but woud you bid less than game opposite partner's opening 1@s?|pg||
nt|chick: booo|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Good lead.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: For defence.|pg||
nt|chick: pretty skinny GF by S|pg||
nt|npcjpn: 4@d splinter discourages.|pg||
nt|davidstern: North may be aiming for 6@C|pg||
nt|davidstern: which would be playable opposite nothing more than the @SK and @CAQ|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: they wouldn't like the 4@s on the side|pg||
pc|d4|nt|sharkey: Vet ikke hvor N fant doblingen i Åpent Rom?|pg||
nt|sharkey: 5@C makes - not 6...|pg||
nt|henryb:  If 4@d is forcing, I approve, otherwise 5@d seems indicated|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2S was said to be GF\|pg||
nt|chick: if 2@S is GF....|pg||
nt|jaheim: so   10 points  is enough 4 a gf?   strange|pg||
nt|davidstern: Ino may have been better supporting clubs to allow South to better judge the hand|pg||
nt|super nova: More likly to consider 3@d|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: it will merely match the OR :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: oops overboard here|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: but a nice lead|pg||
pc|d5|nt|sharkey: Fant den her og...|pg||
nt|sharkey: I think South's hand is NTish - wud have tried 3@D to make pd bid 3 NT with @D stopper|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes, its frustrating when you find later that you pushed them to a  possibly making game |pg||
nt|april7: @S @S @S the W should discard ace of @C on 3d @D|pg||
nt|davidstern: South should now bid six with the @SK and a singleton heart|pg||
pc|dK|nt|haans: holy ...|pg||
nt|haans: xy Stayman in Sweden we belive that was invented in Denmark long time ago|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Miss Jane pulled most probably Miss Greta would respond|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|chick: agree|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think S should bid 5C over 3D, then he is in position to pass 5D|pg||
nt|henryb:  Suth could not affort Blackwood|pg||
nt|marlowepi: right|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: its a good sac for China to earn 7|pg||
nt|djneill:  4@h is not so bad here, North might have tried to look for it|pg||
pc|s2|nt|rv: this format is not favorite of many of the purists who prefer k/o matches to decide top placings since this format favors beating weak teams comprehensively|pg||
nt|frankaus: 2@H says pd did u have a decent overcall - pd passes to say no,|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: oh dear not optimum defence :(|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mdgraham: after the 3@D rebid, most players play 3@S as competitive only - they either double or bid 3@H as a game try|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh oh |pg||
nt|bucheister: oops|pg||
nt|h_karluk: this is too high|pg||
nt|sybarra: a bit too much |pg||
nt|twcho: no way to avoid the @c finesse|pg||
pc|sK|nt|haans: 2@D GF|pg||
nt|april7: only hope for E to get in if K or Q of @C|pg||
nt|april7: thats an interesting defence|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes 2 promises a few more values|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|lestergold: as spec pointsn o9ut he has forced himnself to bid 4@c over 3@d by his pard whcih would be overdoing the hand|pg||
nt|april7: W must  pray S having another @H|pg||
nt|Walddk4: some would claim|pg||
nt|npcjpn: no claim yet?|pg||
nt|sybarra: some imps back to palestine most likely |pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think Miss Greta forgot who was the captain|pg||
nt|bucheister: 6C would be a great spot even though it does not make|pg||
nt|bucheister: but probably not nice enough|pg||
nt|sybarra: just have to guess the hts on this lead right?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|kiwibridge: def a coffee hand this one Steve|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mcarroll: But on the bidding W may play S for a singleton @S and |pg||
nt|frankaus: quite a good method IMO|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: clim time|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: claim|pg||
pc|s7|nt|sharkey: East got the clue he neede|pg||
nt|haans: i agree 5@D not 4@D best bid|pg||
nt|rnmalik: In any case then only NS may be in game or slam.|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|rnmalik: AK@S and @HK pitching 3@Ds and @D finesse and one @C loser.|pg||
nt|april7: 5 of @S = @C entry|pg||
nt|chick: the @S5 should show @C entry|pg||
nt|bucheister: I agree; it is probably better than 4S|pg||
pc|h3|nt|sharkey: Ingen overstikk her|pg||
nt|jaheim: ja ja,  NS   tror vel neppe de vinner  5 imps etter å ha betalt ut 750|pg||
nt|sharkey: lol|pg||
nt|haans: 1@S-1n-3@S-p|pg||
nt|haans: 2n|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and it's not a bad idea to keep double for penalties, just in case the opponents have stepped out of tline|pg||
nt|kastan88: ahh, sometimeswe are crazy with light openings in Estonia, but much more correct on later biddings or pushings :) |pg||
pc|h8|nt|twcho: and the board will be tied quickly|pg||
pc|hK|nt|h_karluk: i think their conventions are stayman, weak 2, blackwood in prec sys |pg||
nt|h_karluk: just a few classic gadget|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: may lose an imp|pg||
nt|bucheister: yes; I wonder why she did not play the J|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|sybarra: wonder what 5 @D answer was?|pg||
nt|sybarra: was on the right track then....|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: was on the money but fell at the last fence|pg||

pc|s8|nt|mdgraham: best|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Well, she enjoys playing|pg||
nt|npcjpn: only three pitch on diamonds.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Apart from that a valuable contribution by a spec that 3@D being bergen raise could be x by N with all the values and @C suit. |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: opps had 5 / 6 top tricks at the start|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|henryb:  5@d over 3@d would have implied the stiff club|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|lestergold: serious defensive error here no need to inform pard about tyhe diamonds at that stage|pg||

nt|kiwi_joker: yes, North had an opportunity to star ..take @DAce quckly and find spade shift - but didnt|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|april7: should have discarded a @C and now small @H and duck|pg||

nt|vugraphznb: the winner of this match will win the ch.ship|pg||
nt|pelu: or to let opp belive that they have a trick|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It is of course against the laws to delay the game unneccessarily|pg||
nt|rv: I prefer ACBL format or initial RR followed by k/o like in World Series, not a big fan of this format|pg||
nt|frankaus: one can still get a "flat pitch" V a weak tem and be disadvantaged though|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 7@c kind of double a battery attitude|pg||
nt|sybarra: am told, by spec wrong answer, thinks n/s play 0314 |pg||
nt|bucheister: Interesting that they took so long to play that hand;  I like to get it over with quickly|pg||
nt|frankaus: 300 looks like a pickup 4 NS |pg||
nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that means they give up to use weak 2 as preempts|pg||
nt|iceblue: 2@D|pg||
nt|bucheister: that might be shortness|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: oh dear painful to watch really :)|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: so 3 imp loss but miles better than going down|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: now back to 7 cunning|pg||
nt|vugraphzrc: ok|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: W opened but Christine and Jenna had no trouble reaching 3N|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: 3NT bid and made looks a good result for NZ, with West sitting over  dummy's only 2 honour cards|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: true|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: misread the scale|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: most of those tiny pluses wiped in one hand|pg||
nt|kastan88: not my taste that 4@D with flat hand|pg||
nt|frankaus: hard to ignore the green light :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: it went nicely|pg||
nt|djneill:  quiet since board 1's free for all|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: very slow scoring|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: ie let him make his own mistakes or no0t as the case may be|pg||

nt|kastan88: GM Roland|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hello Jaak|pg||
nt|kaz08833: NS can make 6@s?|pg||
nt|twcho: Chinese Taipei will certainly score another 25 this round against Mongolia but they still have to face Australia and China in the final few rounds|pg||
nt|djneill:  other room here E-W had a lazy strong club auction to 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: not provide him with a route map to 9 tricks|pg||
nt|sharkey: Rite - and discrading !K at the end position and keeping 3 x @C may have resulted in a set|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Last board of this segment, interesting hands as reflected by the respective scores, no unwanted swings.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's written black on white|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But maybe she could not see that she had 11 tricks; that's an excuse|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but in 0314 4N>5@c 0-3. 5@d 1-4, 5@h 2 and 5@s 2+ trump Q is not it ?|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes still |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes a mini splinter 3@C was X'd by N|pg||
nt|iceblue: 2@D=WK 2M|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Tom may get excited|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: The challenge here is to bid game|pg||
nt|davidstern: South got a heart lead and carelessly ruffed a diamond losing all communication with dummy|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe pulled wrong card out of bidding box|pg||
nt|h_karluk: could be|pg||
nt|ralfwil: the "new" house is built 1932, but they have spent a lot of money to make it "up to date"|pg||
nt|xenya: another partscore battle coming?|pg||
nt|iceblue: 2@H=pre with 2 majors|pg||

nt|jaheim: late|pg||
nt|sybarra: happens to all of us |pg||
nt|h_karluk: very aggressive 2@h|pg||
nt|sybarra: looks like tartan 2 suited type bid|pg||
nt|suketbombi: a close Match till now Phillippines doing well to Take the Might of Patrick and his Team|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: mini splinter GF|pg||
nt|kastan88: ahaa, that's it some splinter bid?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: any splinter says Nick|pg||
nt|twcho: so they are having tougher schedule than Indonesia|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: 7 stikk mulig her|pg||
nt|jaheim: no  3 nt looks ok it playing on @Ds|pg||
nt|henryb:  but would you with AKK and four trumps, a couple of extra jacks and a doubleton?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: sneaking admiration for double by North |pg||
nt|h_karluk: this would make east's day|pg||
nt|h_karluk: with 18 easy to buy|pg||
nt|kaz08833: seems 6@S by N is virtually cold|pg||

mb|p|nt|jaheim: if   playing|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Or 6NT? with 12 tops?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: A bit surprising nobody found the red card after 4@S in OR|pg||

mb|2D|nt|haans: as all others try for game|pg||

nt|davidstern: I took an oath never to bid 3N T with a void in partner's suit but that was in 1975|pg||
nt|davidstern: I should say I have stuck with it ever since|pg||
nt|pelu: borderline 2@D (Michael) in Red|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Amazing, EW sold out to 2@S on board 6 in the open room|pg||
nt|kastan88: till now closed, but last 2 boards may be good results for Taipei, as 5th board Philippines lost 4@S and in 6th is possible to bid and win 3NT|pg||
nt|super nova: I think I would find a 2@S bid|pg||
nt|iceblue: dbl 2@D= 13-15 bal or 19+ any|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: but then A@H didn't cash|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: N has 8 tricks own hand|pg||
nt|twcho: NS plays precision|pg||
nt|djneill:  looks similar to that other auction - 1@c = strong, 16+ ART|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: as would I|pg||
nt|sharkey: Will get to game now|pg||
nt|Walddk4: West doubled 1NT, then she doubled 2@D and then she passed 2@S|pg||
nt|rv: Laltu should pass here, not enough for raise to 3@d in my opinion|pg||
nt|bucheister: seems that 3D is automatic|pg||
nt|iceblue: 3@D is a little agreesive|pg||
nt|npcjpn: but it was East who doubled. |pg||
nt|kaz08833: 4@H might show H void|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: seems all too wierd|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: this could get passed out|pg||
nt|twcho: 1@d may promise only 2+ cards|pg||
mb|2S|nt|sharkey: 2NT Invitational Values min @S and 4 card support|pg||
nt|april7: but cross ruff is already open|pg||
nt|npcjpn: @dQ and @CK are great card for East.|pg||
nt|kaz08833: i'm not sure of NS's 3@H and 4@H difference|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: wowee|pg||
nt|kastan88: and fast claim|pg||
nt|djneill:  West 2@c= 8-10, game force, 5+@c|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: some matches have traded 30+ imps on less boards|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaheim: but needs to lead a @D, i think|pg||
nt|lestergold: moral of this session has been when you are dealt a double then double|pg||
nt|sharkey: Why didnt S bid 3 NT?|pg||
nt|haans: invite or not invite that is the question|pg||
nt|haans: 2@H prermpt in my book|pg||
nt|chick: after the X, 2@H shows 8+ in my book :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: last board in this match|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: 2 matches to go|pg||
nt|mcarroll: After I predicted a flat board on 6 I hesitate to say anything here - But............|pg||
nt|jaheim: 1   i think   ,  Liv Marit|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: yes, you're right jaheim|pg||
nt|april7: I think losing at most 2 @S and 2 aces|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: one more match|pg||
nt|h_karluk: you know people didn't much attend even to GNT finals|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.bridgeunlimited.com/bridge/ViewMasterEvent2?code=10ASIA&header=pabf|pg||
nt|sybarra: that is only site I have|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: W overcalled 1@D with his vul 7 count, guess E was provoked|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: so looks like 10 to NZ|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: a bonus indeed|pg||
nt|djneill:  2@d, 2@s natural|pg||
nt|djneill:  2@d might be a relay for some|pg||
mb|2N|nt|davidstern: And even then......|pg||
nt|npcjpn: @D to 9.|pg||
nt|npcjpn: East should have @CA instead of @CKJ to bid 3@D.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: agree, and a trump short as well|pg||
nt|frankaus: looks a too round for my liking|pg||
nt|h_karluk: as i inspected $23 each session for open pairs|pg||
nt|bucheister: philly is pricey; the large market next to the Marriott is just great; I could eat there everyday; fresh seafood; pastas; every type of food served in small booth areas at ...|pg||
nt|bucheister: reasonable prices|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i ve never been in Philly but heard there's a great Metro system|pg||
nt|kastan88: undisciplined 2NT IMO|pg||
nt|twcho: there are 6 tricks after @s lead. where is the 7th?|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: AKK is extra in it self|pg||
nt|henryb:  better case at matchpoints|pg||
nt|sharkey: We would all lead @HQ vs 3 NT and set it....|pg||
nt|chick: and I have a known double fit in the majors (assuming a normal takeout double)|pg||
nt|sharkey: I wud bid 2@D to show both M and some points|pg||
nt|haans: yep good for 2@D instead of @H bid|pg||
nt|frankaus: friendly @H layout|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, will make|pg||
nt|othered1: 3@D by whom?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: W|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: claim 12 on the @C hook|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: oh dear bid  OR Blair tells me|pg||
nt|vugraphzrc: hi all|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: a pulled plug?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|haans: im on Volls side|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Depends what 2NT showed|pg||
nt|bucheister: West|pg||
nt|npcjpn: in open room, West bid 5@d as (probably) a lead-directing, and East thought it creates a forcing pass, I guess.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: if xx was an offer to play 5@DXX S should have grabbed it|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: there has been a fair amountg of no trump avoidance too|pg||
nt|sharkey: May work out ok|pg||
nt|sharkey: 5@C that is|pg||
nt|lestergold: im susrprised that 3n failed in open room|pg||
nt|haans: yes at IMP you seldom pass before game|pg||
nt|chick: that would also work if such agreed|pg||
nt|sharkey: This won't be easy|pg||
nt|mcarroll: True Roland|pg||
nt|mdgraham: NS wil be quite pleased to gain an imp after going four down vulnerable in a freely-bid game |pg||
nt|sybarra: great city and hotel location is right down town, easy to get around|pg||
nt|sybarra: in the other room,   the 2 @S bid led the commentators to suggest taking immediate @H hook agst the j of H!'s|pg||
nt|djneill:  East's 2NT allows West to show extreme shape if it is there|pg||
nt|djneill:  which would make slam a possibility|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Solves trump problem|pg||
nt|lestergold: well ive checked play first took club the unatural way then after spade switch took a secons spade finesse rather than dim finesse when defenders had warned himn that spades were ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: both 'wrong'|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Well, the cardinal sin, Mike. Declarer had his contract but went for overtricks|pg||
nt|sharkey: Viego will suffer their first defeat |pg||
nt|h_karluk: I liked The Marriot, have been there in many sectionals, regionals|pg||
nt|h_karluk: classy|pg||
nt|super nova: Doesnt promise any points.|pg||
nt|xenya: easy to play too|pg||
nt|frankaus: 10 2 aces  -  red game in the offing  - i would make a game try |pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  if partner signs off the game may be less than 50%|pg||
nt|davidstern: South will switch to a spade at a million miles and hour if East plays another diamond |pg||
nt|pelu: yes KJ no value when pd 5-5 in major|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridgeunlimited.com/bridge/ViewMasterEvent2?code=10ASIA&header=pabf  for results|pg||
nt|pelu: a major Q better than @cK|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: has already denied many :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: x 13-15 or 19+ any|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lestergold: i see contract failed in open but surely playing on clubs declarer should make this|pg||
nt|haans: you need a good 50% to bid non vul games|pg||
nt|haans: better bidding than OR|pg||
nt|pelu: ??????????????|pg||
nt|npcjpn: East probably hoped miracle AQ in majors.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Sophia is lucky that this does not cost the contract|pg||
nt|kaz08833: xx = @DK and 5@H = ask for something?|pg||
nt|djneill:  if West has Axxx  x  xx  QJxxxx slam could be good|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lestergold: play for split honours in clubs shoul lose a heart a club and a diamond at most|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Last board for the match. Back in 10-15 mins|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|sharkey: Ø må spille på at N må ha begge Ess for å vinne kontrakten|pg||
nt|lestergold: it wasnt for overtrick played for split spade honours rather than dim finesse which a priori was better odds but suspicous on the dfence|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: ??|pg||
pc|h5|nt|lestergold: 9 dimds would be a better card to play by east|pg||
nt|sharkey: killing lead - but nobody lead high from xxx??|pg||
nt|pelu: why not play @C8 - only chance is to find Q10x in C in N = discard for 3@Ss|pg||
nt|kastan88: OR bidding that 6@S? or NS pushing them in competition?|pg||
pc|hT|nt|Walddk4: Mike, BOA and Martin|pg||
nt|npcjpn: now North knows South has another spade, so the defense is not tough.|pg||
nt|frankaus: i meant for N to X |pg||
nt|kastan88: just change NS hands, and with @C lead just disaster, and, try is good only if some suit running, do you think its spades or diamonds?|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lestergold: we are seeing a lot of card play shall we say less than perfect plays in this match|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|suketbombi: wud duck the @H return i suppose while @C shift will make things easy for him|pg||
nt|twcho: but Manoppo chose @c|pg||
pc|s8|nt|april7: why not 3 of @D from N?|pg||
nt|jaheim: and it will be a pleasure tu buy   Liv M a beer next year   tx  all   and cong. to team   Ugh|pg||

nt|haans: OR forgot  most pass bids|pg||
nt|sybarra: hmm surprised she didnt just cover S card|pg||
nt|othered1: 3@D by west would h ave been too pushy for me.   Should be saved for maximums, not just good shape|pg||
nt|kastan88: sure, before playing diamonds|pg||

nt|jaheim: går bet nå  stor kl fra hånden hadde vært bedre denne gang|pg||

mb|3N|nt|psridhar: whatever it is, i fully agree with such interference over strog club opg|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: strong clubbers shd not be given a free ride-their auctions after 1c are far too accurate for my comfort as oppo|pg||

nt|othered1: If west opens, yes.  If not, seems very tough|pg||
nt|kaz08833: probably input error|pg||
nt|kastan88: I know well, that in vulnerable need to try, but still not my choice, on long distance you win more passing 2s|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 8 to Singapore we are half way|pg||
nt|twcho: before going to dummy for @cQ|pg||
nt|twcho: and east will be show up squeezed by the @hA|pg||
nt|djneill:  East was threatening to cash @cAK, then over to @s and run @s, squeezing anyone with @d guard and @cQ (but @cQ drops)|pg||
mb|p|nt|davidstern: Sorry Japan of course ----- I have to wish you adieu and will see you all soon|pg||

mb|1C|nt|suketbombi: agressive 3@D wud only preampt his pd here|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: 12 big ones to NZ there|pg||
nt|kastan88: just bid, lucky EW in OR|pg||
nt|twcho: is south hand good enough to bid 3 level new suit|pg||
mb|1H|nt|mdgraham: sorry all, I have to go now. Enjoy the rest.|pg||
nt|suketbombi: pity 6@H on a @H guess and languising in 3@D|pg||
nt|djneill:  East strong 1@c again|pg||
mb|d|nt|pelu: diff hand for S - some would bid 1NT|pg||
nt|rv: India coming back a bit in bowling power-play|pg||
nt|kastan88: how now to find even 4@H for EW?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: that's closed up this match of lost opportunities|pg||
nt|npcjpn: South is famous for comic 1NT overcall in Japan, but is it true?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 1NT even if comic is awful|pg||
nt|npcjpn: 8-card heart suit is his record for 1NT overcall.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I feel it should be bid here too, insurance they used to call it|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: this 3@D is not vul, ok with you Frank and Jaak?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 27 unanswered imps and we are half way|pg||
nt|twcho: assuming they play lebensohl|pg||
mb|2H|nt|rv: thanks Mike, bye|pg||

nt|kastan88: both rooms didn't find killing @D lead previous|pg||
mb|p|nt|npcjpn: without @D10, I prefer pass.|pg||
nt|dslee: N has to be innovative leading that|pg||
nt|iceblue: no, they play 2/1|pg||
nt|twcho: so south decides that his hand isn't worth it and bid 2NT|pg||
nt|deltadash: East should go on the road and play money bridge with these cards he's getting|pg||

nt|h_karluk: i expect 4@c|pg||
nt|bucheister: agreed; but playing precision that hand is opened one spade and the rest is history|pg||
nt|othered1: some people are reticent to splinter with stiff A, especially with a limited hand.|pg||
mb|d|nt|pelu: a fight for the 7. trick - I exp that West wil win that battle|pg||
nt|kastan88: just such preempts, with outside A are not good|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: as if the earthquake wasn't bad enough, gale force wind storms are on the way there :(|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: @D7 is not a beer card if diamonds are trumps i think|pg||
nt|iceblue: wow¡£¡£¡£|pg||
nt|h_karluk: why not 1@h John? @h and @s are not both 10+ openings with 5+ cards?:)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but if u meant rebid problem ok|pg||
nt|kaz08833: S's 1NT must be CRASH (@S and @D OR @H and @C)|pg||
nt|kastan88: after splinter was doubled by South, may be really slam is worth to try- @HK is well positioned, partner may have all right honors|pg||
nt|djneill:  South uses the time honored tradition of bidding over a strong @c to stop long precise auctions|pg||
mb|2N|nt|h_karluk: std @d K lead, but depends players, @c or @s also available|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.bridgeunlimited.com/bridge/ViewMasterEvent2?code=10ASIA&header=pabf  for results|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridgeunlimited.com/bridge/ViewMasterEvent2?code=10ASIA&header=pabf  for results|pg||
nt|bucheister: equal length|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think KNR would bid 1@h in any natural sys, chances much|pg||
nt|djneill:  West's double = "5-7 any shape" probably|pg||
nt|djneill:  2nd double should be negative|pg||
nt|djneill:  East's 2NT should be NF|pg||
nt|deltadash: sometimes it's fun to screw with the opps system :)|pg||
nt|djneill:  does this make 3N?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: no :)|pg||
nt|bucheister: my feeling is no way|pg||
nt|deltadash: not if I declare it, lol|pg||
mb|p|nt|npcjpn: from the bidding, North is marked with at most 3@s and 1@h, so must have 5+@d.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 19 teams in the open, 16 in the women's|pg||
nt|sybarra: must say E was not bashful |pg||
nt|npcjpn: oh, i see. |pg||
nt|kaz08833: N's 4@H is pass or correct|pg||
nt|frankaus: would like a shortage tho|pg||
nt|djneill:  3@h, 2@s, 2@d, but @c not so hot|pg||
mb|p|nt|npcjpn: win with @HK? Now case for typical second hand high for North.|pg||
nt|pelu: best to play a small @S now|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our match in round 4 will be India v Sri Lanka (open)|pg||
nt|suketbombi: No shame if u just bid your game and make it but 3@D is the worst possible contract for E-W|pg||
nt|super nova: This reminds me of a hand my partner had Monday|pg||
nt|othered1: west still has no clue that east doesn't have @Sxx and @CK (xx)|pg||
nt|iceblue: Gee...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: all filled in cards there, only need few picture cards in M|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hook a trump now :)|pg||

nt|djneill:  might pick up an extra |pg||

pc|h3|nt|h_karluk: suits|pg||
nt|npcjpn: i did not notice 1@c was strong because there is no alert.|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|rv: I agree with Sanyal that North did have a case for leading a @s with no entry in his hand trying to lead partner's major|pg||
nt|super nova: AKQJx|pg||

nt|othered1: Silly bidding|pg||
nt|bucheister: 4nt is wild and crazy|pg||
nt|h_karluk: would make slam|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: It's Steph's style to raise on 3-cards there|pg||

nt|sybarra: but "only 50's" at the point |pg||

nt|kiwibridge: this is the half way board|pg||

nt|vugraphzrc: ok|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d6|pg||
nt|rv: at MPs, not selling OTs is as important that beating contract, hence @s lead|pg||
nt|bucheister: I think that school is out|pg||
nt|djneill:  North is a great partner :-)  that's the third time|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|kiwibridge: so all square at half way|pg||
nt|twcho: yes, a bit mysterious|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|pc|s8|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe too relaxed being in 2?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: there are after shocks and fires, electricty and sewage down, looting in the cbd, and now a plane crash on the Fox Glacier|pg||
nt|deltadash: lol - are we in a rut or what Dan???|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s9|nt|xenya: he had 9 tricks -- 4 clubs, 2 spades, 2 hearts and a diamond -- no need to risk finesses|pg||
nt|kastan88: I remember as  20 years ago i was apologate of forcing pass system with relays.... Lot of strength and time then went to bidding games, usually 4-7 rounds. But sure all ...|pg||
nt|kastan88: distributional slams and games were well bid. |pg||
pc|s3|pc|s7|pg||
nt|dslee: north would have been thinking - no, I should have lead @S , depends on how the handled after that|pg||

nt|rnmalik: unfriendly placement of cards here.|pg||
nt|kastan88: pass, 4h?|pg||
nt|xenya: undo please|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ed, say right opens, u ve KQTx, Atx, Atx, Atx, new generation bids 1N, but old generation doubles, bcos hopes @s, say 1@d/@h comes still 16-18 rt? but new generation believes ...|pg||

nt|h_karluk: *righty|pg||
nt|bucheister: she could be off 2S, 2H or 2D and the combinations; she needed a big fit bid and the only one available was to splinter in her singleton which works on this hand.  E will never ...|pg||
nt|bucheister: stop|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: what happened - did the deal just change?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: pre-empt got pard that time, -5 again|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the accidental throw in|pg||
nt|kastan88: my consolations to all New Zealand|pg||
nt|deltadash: we need some action!!|pg||
mb|1D|nt|sybarra: it was just 2 @s and she had 7 of them + a void |pg||
mb|d|nt|npcjpn: do you overcall 2@C?|pg||
nt|dslee: Kushari should bid 3@D|pg||
nt|kastan88: say, if pass with W hand or open 1@D, then South possibly bidding t/o double after 1@H from East, and spades easily found|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: operator - we have skipped 2 boards?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: a michaels special|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Japan did well in OR here|pg||
nt|djneill:  East's run of opening strength hands continues,  6 in a row|pg||
mb|1H|nt|pelu: bad luck for NS-players - 4@S down 1 with 3 @c-losers|pg||
nt|rv: Kushari may bid only 2@d at this vul on South's X|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so different ideas wld always be there, there were a slam u know and wld b nice if they'd land|pg||
nt|kaz08833: coffee time came up after all|pg||
nt|npcjpn: 2@d = one major|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 2@D?|pg||
nt|kaz08833: 2@D = @S OR @H|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: W will guess what it is|pg||
nt|mathat: by manoppo 6 @D @S NT|pg||
nt|twcho: not sure what is their NT range|pg||
mb|d|nt|npcjpn: 2, 3 or 4@S.|pg||
nt|dslee: to create some problem for NS to reach their game|pg||
nt|sybarra: now we know its a club system of some sort|pg||
nt|xenya: what's that?|pg||
nt|npcjpn: some calls woolsey, some calls multi-landy or reversed cappelletti|pg||
nt|kaz08833: 4@H or 3NT by EW is cold anyway|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: The double is a bit askew .. surely it's just a 2@H bid by South|pg||
nt|vugraphzrc: yeah,i will ask them|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: they must play 3@C rank|pg||
nt|mathat: no NT|pg||
nt|djneill:  North's precision 1@d could have longer @c so EAst's double is not takeout of @d, per se|pg||
mb|2S|nt|kiwibridge: horrible red suits :(|pg||
nt|bucheister: notice they do not open very light in 3rd seat; I like 1H at this vulnerability|pg||
nt|othered1: You're saying that stayman was the right start to that hand?  It seems wrong if they have either transfer bids or 2-way stayman available.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: even earlier than 76 :) which is when I first met him|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Indonesia now co-leaders with Chinese Taipei, they are up 33-0 after 5|pg||
nt|twcho: 2@s promise 4 cards support|pg||
nt|djneill:  I've been told South's 1@h is a normal 1@s response, over the double|pg||
mb|3H|nt|iceblue: 4@S? 3@C? cant be, it is the famous 5332|pg||
nt|npcjpn: i guessed wrong.|pg||
nt|rv: KP is worth a bid of 4@s with his hand, all useful cards and 5th @s|pg||
nt|dslee: most likely 4@H now|pg||
nt|rv: I presume he is setting GF with 3@d cue in case partner has a big hand|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @s10986543 @h---@d864 @caq2|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 1@H 19+|pg||
nt|twcho: 1@h = @s|pg||
nt|djneill:  welcome Tommy Cho|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: probably they play variable NT|pg||
nt|mathat: play 6 @d only one lead x @c from Ahed|pg||
nt|twcho: when non-vul 11-13 and vul 14-16|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 6@S looks 110% by S who has bid them|pg||
mb|4H|nt|Walddk4: Sphia has a good hand for a non-forcing 2@S|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Also known as a negative free bid|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 1@S 0-4|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: presume 2@H a cunning pass ot correct woozle|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Do you really want to play this hand in spades when North rebids 2@S with Qxx of spdes and Ax of hearts?|pg||
nt|twcho: 2@d supposed to be GF checkback|pg||
nt|deltadash: Hi Tommy, welcome|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzrc: sorry|pg||
nt|xenya: np -- you are doing fine|pg||
nt|kaz08833: 2@H shd be simple pass or correct .. not sure if it promises any values|pg||
nt|twcho: and 2@s confirmed 3 cards support|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 3@C?|pg||
mb|p|nt|twcho: hi everyone|pg||
nt|bucheister: welcome|pg||
mb|p|nt|kastan88: can't remember that, I  started that year only in my local club, PABF was too far |pg||
nt|djneill:  momentum has pushed E-W into game|pg||
pc|d4|nt|pelu: i like to have a 6 card minor to overcall - but as lead-directing - Ok - but min |pg||
nt|frankaus: this looks to be coming in|pg||
nt|frankaus: the lead will not give dclarer nightmares :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: cunning lead Baldrick I had a plan|pg||
nt|twcho: so now south should be looking for slam after this start|pg||
nt|deltadash: does he have a prayer?|pg||
pc|d7|nt|pelu: many play 2@s here as F1|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 25 hcp and 4-4 @S fit here but making 3@S wud be tuff for E-W did well to stay away from auction can beat 2@H easily tho|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hard for N after 4 artificial bids|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hi Tommy, not a great game friendly sort of lead|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|npcjpn: a heart shift is not so difficult to find.|pg||
nt|kaz08833: inspired lead|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 3@S a "youth" bid|pg||
nt|twcho: should south just simply sign off?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I'll have a go says Dewi|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|othered1: I guess EW don't go to the three level without considerable extras.|pg||
nt|frankaus: just costs an overtrick i guess|pg||
nt|twcho: or maybe the range promising by the 1NT rebid is not 14-16 as I thought|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Chinese Taipei up 74-0 after a mere 8 boards v Mongolia|pg||
nt|bucheister: our father|pg||
nt|deltadash: hehe|pg||
nt|djneill:  now South will get a @h and a ruff, no question, and North the @sA and a @c|pg||
nt|twcho: seems better to play @d8|pg||
nt|twcho: instead of @dQ|pg||
pc|h2|nt|rv: this is a match, India will expect to win handsomely, SL putting up a good fight and fairly flat boards so far|pg||
nt|dslee: yes, revenge for the cricket finals recently :)|pg||
nt|kastan88: but now we have clever internet and vugraph, so kilometres and miles no problem|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: oh no what a lead|pg||
pc|h4|nt|kaz08833: N will shift to @S10?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 4@H is pushing it up hill|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h8|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: nearly :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: this is all surreal so far|pg||
nt|twcho: seems quite safe to start exploring for slam after the GF sequence|pg||
pc|h3|nt|frankaus: getting late here - i'm going to hit the sack  - tu all 4 your company|pg||
nt|rv: Check http://tinyurl.com/25udavr  for running scores |pg||
nt|h_karluk: now the declarer have no worries abt @dJ, it goes to established @c K|pg||
nt|h_karluk: or a heart loser, maybe would try a hook|pg||
pc|d2|nt|dslee: bye frank - and here I just started my day :)|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: lol. She'll do ok , though|pg||
nt|djneill:  South ducked the @hQJ smoothly|pg||
pc|hT|nt|npcjpn: now South has to lose 2@h, 1@d, and 2@c for one down.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: We all want to get in over 1@D with 2@C if we have any excuse|pg||
nt|sybarra: went down in 4 @H played from the other side on last hand (other table) |pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think either their ping very slow or some unknown problem about input |pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|bucheister: at least our operator ducked smoothly|pg||
nt|twcho: did !2 say anything about suit preference?|pg||
nt|bucheister: yes; it should be clubs|pg||
nt|djneill:  R-M play that East's double of 2@s would be a good 3@h bid, and 3@h would be this, competitive, but West has a dynamic hand|pg||
nt|bucheister: no I believe that would be a 10 card fit; 9 at the three level|pg||
pc|s3|nt|Walddk4: It often creates problems for the opponents|pg||
nt|sybarra: brb  going to check other table |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I started 71, scored the pabf in Auckland in 76 and met Zia who there also|pg||
nt|kastan88: this gives to all of us possibility to taste smell and spirit of all - Huang, Tislevoll, Zia, Meckwell|pg||
pc|s7|nt|npcjpn: 10 is better, but South is marked with @HA, so doesn't matter.|pg||
nt|frankaus: tu all for ur company - my dinner time|pg||
pc|sA|nt|iceblue: nice shift, 1 donw|pg||
nt|suketbombi: oops a sure trump trick sacrificed here|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: mmmm whats happening|pg||
pc|cK|nt|rv: Bye Frank, have a good day|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: all over|pg||
nt|twcho: not sure why south decide to drop short and just bid game|pg||
pc|c3|nt|kiwibridge: yes the world a much smaller place now like you and I working together here :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: nor me unusual|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: given N opened and S free bid I don't see W's hand as all that dynamic|pg||
pc|c8|nt|kiwi_joker: Lose a couple of spades, a club, a diamond and a ruff for -1 I guess|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|bucheister: Some pairs play that a 2S rebid after stayman shows 5 spades and a mild interest;|pg||
nt|h_karluk: good news|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: tu Frank see you again was nice|pg||
pc|d5|nt|npcjpn: but vulnerable and 5-3-3-2, I prefer pass at teams.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Sabine Auken has a chapter on that issue in her book "I love this game"|pg||
nt|super nova: Here is an artical given to me by a spec 'plarq'|pg||
pc|d3|nt|h_karluk:  8 OR EW found slam @h|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: live results both open and ladies http://www.bridgeunlimited.com/bridge/ViewMasterEvent2?code=10ASIA&header=pabf|pg||
nt|twcho: if they can find 6@d it will be the best slam and will only be defeated by a cunning @c lead|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Our match in round 7 in 1 hour and 50 minutes is Hong Kong v New Zealand (Women)|pg||
nt|frankaus: 4@S or 3NT |pg||

mb|1N|nt|suketbombi: 6@C any one?|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: overdose of ging seng?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|npcjpn: classical 4@c open unless using Namyats.|pg||
nt|rv: E-W open 1@d with 44 or 55 in minors and open 1@c with 33 in minors|pg||
nt|kastan88: I never know how to bid that right, say partner has some 5..6 against your 26? how find right 44 fits in minors?|pg||
nt|frankaus: 2 round hand 3NT looks preferable|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: seems not :(|pg||
mb|p|nt|npcjpn: i expected upgrade 1NT openiing.|pg||
nt|rv: West's double is negative and shows 4+@s|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the kiwi teams are completely self funded for this event|pg||
nt|othered1: double just shows values, I guess.  Not a safe call in standard, but likely mandatory here.|pg||
nt|twcho: is west hand good enough for an invite after strong NT by partner?|pg||
nt|twcho: certainly not |pg||
nt|bucheister: noooo|pg||
nt|twcho: need @h breaks, @d break and @cK on|pg||
nt|djneill:  North's 2@h should be serious - vulnerable 2-level overcalls are rocks|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: it makes so it aint awful|pg||
mb|3N|nt|iceblue: mild   5@C|pg||
nt|rv: sorry it shows 4@s, Laltu would bid 1@s with 5@s|pg||

nt|xenya: wonder what 1@D means|pg||
nt|bucheister: do we all like 2D?|pg||
nt|kaz08833: only possible if W can show @H shortness|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: seems a gutty pass, perhap they don't have look for minor fits|pg||
nt|npcjpn: only if West has a game-forcing values, and 3@h shows this kind of shape.|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: how about 5@C by W ?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: board 7 corrected, 10 imp NZ|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: 600 to go with +750 would be nice  :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 3 @S losers tho|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 4@H anyone :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwi_joker: not played by West|pg||
nt|bucheister: at least they won't make 7|pg||
nt|djneill:  West's 1NT, knowing East is limited to 11-15, was a tactical move|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: Only air tickets needed, hospitality free as was informed yesterday.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: no not if W I see|pg||
mb|p|nt|suketbombi: wonder how may players wud show 25+ by bidding 3nt these days:):)|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: yes a very good one|pg||
pc|sK|nt|pelu: west only exp 10-11 by pd|pg||

nt|pelu: 6@c need !x 3-3 or @c10 drop|pg||
nt|xenya: 4@S might be tricky|pg||
nt|kastan88: may be using some montreal 1@D bid, 1M= 5-card then only|pg||
nt|bucheister: E rather than 2S|pg||
nt|othered1: I coiuld like wityh 2@D on east's hand over the double, but it does give them @H to bid at the 2-level|pg||
nt|othered1: I could live with . . . |pg||
nt|h_karluk: mandatory 2@s by E|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: could transfer to @C on the way to @D but when E super accepts @C...|pg||
pc|sT|nt|npcjpn: not so great slam,|pg||

nt|frankaus: friendly @D layout|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s4|pg||
nt|rv: Rex is trying slow the auction down and possibly doesn't want to commit 3 level|pg||

nt|bucheister: Sorry, I know it is a good suit but I cannot stomach a pass of 3nt|pg||
nt|djneill:  South's @s4 makes East's @s5 look like a high @s, discouraging|pg||
nt|twcho: good point Dan|pg||
nt|twcho: EW plays UDCA?|pg||
nt|bucheister: they must|pg||
pc|c6|nt|suketbombi: vow agressive|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Phoebe Lin|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: oop|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: A@S lead would help|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sybarra: asking for stop?|pg||
nt|lmeili: hi all|pg||
nt|h_karluk: there's a 8 cards @s fit, 6 hcp and no feature|pg||
nt|bucheister: cu all and gn|pg||
nt|h_karluk: bye for now|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Tom hopes in vain Martin to have an entry + a @H|pg||
pc|cK|nt|rv: @s lead or early @s switch may not be required to beat this|pg||
nt|rv: may be required|pg||
nt|kastan88: or they don't know?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: thanks|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i also have 20 minutes to stay here, tomorrow i am scheduled for all day Israeli Grand Prix which starts at 09am EDT|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: omg|pg||
nt|twcho: now only 1 imp to CT|pg||
nt|bucheister: this is crazy|pg||
nt|twcho: will get 12 tricks|pg||
pc|dA|nt|dslee: i would has thought laltu would lead a @S |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hold your hats folks|pg||
nt|vugraphzrc: haha|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: its better than 1N|pg||
nt|kastan88: let's count 5@H-3@S-@DK + 1 club ruff = how many tricks?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: plenty :)|pg||
pc|d5|nt|suketbombi: no they dont know what is going on and will land in 6nt|pg||
pc|d4|nt|rv: no harm done, easy for Kushari|pg||
nt|twcho: China is trailing Singapore so probably the final winner will be either Chinese Taipei or Indonesia|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|suketbombi: unless the J is put up still no cahnce for the decl|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: it's a vul game going begging so their methods not too good|pg||
nt|twcho: the @s4 does it part|pg||
pc|d6|nt|Walddk4: On board 9, East was penalised in 2@C|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: unlucky|pg||
pc|d3|nt|sybarra: with a @H lead this will roll home with lots of tricks|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes indeed grateful for that but still costs them a lot |pg||
pc|dT|pc|s6|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: this time they luck in as 3N failed|pg||
pc|d8|nt|pelu: west: -"sorry partner, I didn't expect that u had an opening hand" :):)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: She played it a little carelessly and will go for 500|pg||
nt|npcjpn: no claim again.|pg||
nt|npcjpn: probably 1NT = 14-16, because they play precision.|pg||
nt|kaz08833: so 6 imps to Macau?|pg||
pc|s7|nt|kiwi_joker: Funny thing is, EW will be feeling shattered about this board now .... but they've picked up 12|pg||
pc|dK|nt|Walddk4: Well, even 800 it cost. 13 IMPs to Japan|pg||
nt|sybarra: and fabuous @D spots |pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|Walddk4: So AKQxx not a guarantee that you can't be doubled at the 2-level|pg||

nt|npcjpn: Can South continue spade if the contract is 6@C?|pg||
nt|npcjpn: North's pass is well judged.|pg||
nt|twcho: so interesting to note that north has to duck the ace for 3 rounds to defeat this contract|pg||
nt|kastan88: well done of course|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: olay Indonesia well earned|pg||
nt|twcho: China has yet to score a single imp|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwibridge: yes instead of 16 for 5@C as Nick points out only cost 4 to fail in slam|pg||
mb|1C|nt|iceblue: yes, |pg||
nt|h_karluk:  9 Ew reached 4@s|pg||
mb|1H|nt|h_karluk: so a little IMPs back after that 6@h disaster|pg||

mb|p|nt|iceblue: he disc @S on @H and @D|pg||
nt|othered1: Not surprising.  Did west show extras there?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: EW can take the first six tricks against 3NT, but ......|pg||
nt|suketbombi: Philippines loosing there way here after a close initial match|pg||
nt|xenya: perhaps N considers his hand to be too strong for a simple overcall|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: another routine part-score deal|pg||
nt|dslee: 3@C now|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ice what's their 1@d range please|pg||
pc|c2|nt|iceblue: seems EW is playing prec?|pg||
nt|npcjpn: but he has to guess the location of @hK.|pg||
nt|npcjpn: I don't know, but must be weak NT.|pg||
nt|npcjpn: pass forces redouble, and East will pass it.|pg||
nt|xenya: 3@C must be a weak raise|pg||
nt|twcho: is 2@s forcing?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: should be|pg||
nt|twcho: seems so|pg||
nt|twcho: will east bid 4?|pg||
nt|twcho: which happens to be easy and cold|pg||
nt|twcho: CT needs a big win to have a real chance against Indonesia|pg||
nt|bucheister: now is the time|pg||
pc|c4|nt|iceblue: indeed|pg||
nt|Walddk4: If East gives declarer a spade trick, she can take 9|pg||
nt|pelu: well or lucky? - we have seen here that a negativ D was passed out - down 1 with 5@d to make|pg||
nt|rv: I might have bid 2@c with KP's hand in round earlier instead of guessing now|pg||
nt|iceblue: 0-7|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ty|pg||
nt|othered1: The ususal good showing for the big @C system here.  Of course, very old-fashioned players might find 1@H (opened and passed out.)|pg||
nt|iceblue: 1NT=17-19|pg||
nt|npcjpn: now coffee hand.|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|rv: he has guessed well though|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: playing a natural acol I quite like 14-16 nt instead of the trad 12-14|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: what is 2H|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: this could be more|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: not sure why they didnt investigate the 4-4 spade fit, but it's all good news|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Jane should bring this home for a decent plus|pg||

pc|cA|pg||

nt|rnmalik: A@D and 4@S would be a make.|pg||
nt|kastan88: bergen raise would work here, not easy to find now 3@S stop|pg||
nt|npcjpn: undo please.|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: 8 top tricks now .. and leading diamonds towards dummy brings a 9th|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 5 losers if the cash|pg||
nt|deltadash: they're working on it Tommy :)|pg||
nt|twcho: the final opponent of Indonesia is Korea and you can't expect much from the Koreans|pg||
pc|h3|nt|suketbombi: Friendly @S & @HS should be a cool 420 for E-W|pg||

nt|twcho: well done|pg||
pc|h8|nt|Walddk4: Spade to the queen, club finesse, heart to hand, club finesse, @CK and a heart. 9 tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Can well happen|pg||
nt|super nova: Should have no trouble making.|pg||
nt|twcho: exactly the same acution as in OR|pg||
pc|hK|nt|Walddk4: But all academic now|pg||
nt|sybarra: sorry must leave you,  an extremely early start for me in the morning  and 1140pm here  |pg||
nt|rnmalik: 4@S+5@D+1@H=10|pg||
nt|kaz08833: 2@H? do NS introduce a new convention?|pg||
nt|twcho: so as the result. :)|pg||
nt|mathat: 9 |pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: a delicate 4-2 |pg||
pc|h2|nt|rv: this is 1 level too high for Indian EW here|pg||
nt|sybarra: I will see tomorrow |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: now a 4-3|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: a curfew is in place in Christchurch, to stop the looters I guess|pg||
nt|twcho: are there any casulties?|pg||
pc|hT|nt|rv: even on this lead, Kushari can't avoid losing 3@s, 1@h and !1c|pg||
nt|npcjpn: probably time-saving by operator.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: lol|pg||
nt|vugraphzrc: sorry|pg||
nt|kaz08833: whatever S's contract rite?|pg||
nt|npcjpn: do not mind. |pg||
pc|hA|nt|kiwibridge: np Xu @H|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: or overs for S|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: alas no entries|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|super nova: I have 20 / 20 vision|pg||
nt|super nova: or at least that is what the scores say.|pg||
nt|kaz08833: sorry N's contract i see|pg||
pc|s4|nt|pelu: the first 5 tricks for defense?|pg||
nt|npcjpn: so 3NT has more chance than 3@c.|pg||
nt|kastan88: i would not double with passed partner, IMO better to say just 1@S overcall and hope for possibility later to double for max overcall, if needed|pg||
nt|othered1: There goes the possible 3rd @S trick|pg||
nt|h_karluk: fortunately @s8 at the table|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes always N|pg||
pc|s9|nt|super nova: The consideration here is likly the diamonds.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: great play|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: so another 10 .. NZ headed for a healthy win here|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: EW 5 card majors 2+@C|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: maybe he mis sorted|pg||
nt|kastan88: for me seems East's double over 3@H as penalty oriented... I would left that. East had another forcing bids - 3S 4@C or not?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: X of 3@H take out no one knows why Reid did not open 1@S|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c3|nt|Walddk4: yes|pg||
nt|othered1: there is a case for east to read the position and play @S2.  West just has to be prepared for that.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and @h j entry there|pg||
pc|c5|nt|kastan88: now in both rooms Kiwis playing diamonds, not rich choice this time|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|npcjpn: on board 10, open room EW got to 6@c and down with a spade ruff.|pg||
nt|twcho: But Indonesia performance in this tournament is amazing|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|rv: he can claim 1 down and go to next deal|pg||
nt|xenya: my opinion too|pg||
pc|h4|nt|npcjpn: If North reopens 1NT instead of 2@H, NS will get there.|pg||
nt|suketbombi: strange line one looser in every suit now|pg||
nt|bucheister: I am not sure how the duck could work; the old college try would be the A and low|pg||
pc|s6|nt|Walddk4: Would not be unreasonable to lead a low spade, but it's a disaster as the cards lie|pg||
nt|lmeili: he expects to have @d 3-3 & @s 2-2 break|pg||
nt|kastan88: yes, have not chance, if @HA not right, so still needed to play to @HK|pg||
nt|othered1: declarer will take her  plus without further ado.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: no deaths thankfully, it's sad how the animals come out in a disaster|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|twcho: In the previous 17 rounds (including a bye) they have won 16 matches only losing slightly to Singapore|pg||
pc|dA|nt|Walddk4: Our match in round 3: Japan v Chinese Taipei (women)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our match in round 4: India v Sri Lanka (open)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes and was -300 by Ware now -500|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d7|nt|npcjpn: yes, @H lead is possible, but @d is impposible, @s looks normal.|pg||
nt|lmeili: perhaps he is still thinking of last hand|pg||
nt|kastan88: imo 2@D was forcing, with 4-card @S could bid 1@S, so why double now for take-out, no logical|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
pc|dK|nt|pelu: oh no|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: -1 flat board next please|pg||
pc|d9|nt|kiwibridge: Indonesia now 1 ahead up 39-0 after 8|pg||

nt|h_karluk: Thanks to operator and Alywn Jihe, also Ed Shapiro, gtg guys, tomorrow will b a long day for me, see you :)|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Only if you have the hand records do you take 12 tricks|pg||
nt|npcjpn: looking for 5-3 spade fit.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Normal play is to take a double finesse in diamonds|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: Martin must have had an overdose of red meat to move over 3N|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our match in the last round is New Zealand v Chinese Taipei (women). Before you lynch me (some may want to) I'd like to state that BBO does not decide which matches we get|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 2@D is always 11+ game try|pg||
nt|twcho: Kuo Chieh Hong wrote it|pg||
pc|d2|nt|kiwi_joker: so they have bid it... very understandable, just without hope on this layout|pg||
nt|iceblue: dislike 6@S, 5@D deny controls in @C, |pg||
nt|npcjpn: completely agree with Roland.|pg||
nt|npcjpn: If West bids 4@s over 4@c, East will bid 7@H.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: sure|pg||
nt|pelu: is 4@S here forcing ?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: She will get !AKQ and 4@S shows an honour|pg||
nt|Walddk4: @HAKQ|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Should be Peter. Hearts are set after 4@C|pg||
nt|npcjpn: I do not like 4@s non forcing after 4-level cue bid.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Don't you agree?|pg||
nt|pelu: not sure|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I think it's pretty simple. You can sign-off in 4@H, you can't in 4@S|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Easy to remember|pg||
nt|npcjpn: so hard to forget|pg||
nt|pelu: in CR EW had a better action: 2@H - 3@H - 3@S - after 4NT - 5@S East bid 5NT - but West didnt accept|pg||
pc|d6|nt|iceblue: he need @HA, !K @Sk to make 6@S, its impossible, i think|pg||
nt|npcjpn: On this lead, declarer may think he has a chance in guessing, but...|pg||
nt|iceblue: but got is not sitting behind him:)|pg||
nt|npcjpn: but if declarer gives up clubs, then North has to play @h|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 3@H is probably better when playing 2/1|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: played by E 10@H lead OR|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|suketbombi: donno the provocation to bid with 5hcp and that weak @S suit inispite of the 2nt bid but may work here tho|pg||
nt|rnmalik: yes can, N's bid is one over one, can only be 5@S+|pg||
nt|kastan88: and later not switched to clubs|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: urgh |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: a misunderstanding here,,,|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 3@C was @D + a major thx Arifin|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: then 3@H shoed @S|pg||
nt|djneill:  just 8 tricks even with 2@d so @c must be breached (broached?)|pg||
pc|cT|nt|npcjpn: with @c 3-3, now no need for @d finesse.|pg||
pc|c6|nt|Walddk4: where 2@H is game-forcing|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cK|pg||
pc|d4|nt|rv: play has taken a different course|pg||
nt|suketbombi: there 10 imps on bd 11 alteady a diff of 44 imps close to getting a full 25 at this stage is Chinese Taipei|pg||
pc|d8|nt|Walddk4: Gives you more room to investigate|pg||
nt|npcjpn: East has too many things to tell.|pg||
nt|othered1: I must retire.  Thank you, operator, for the fine presentation.  Thanks everyone else and bye!|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|rv: moment of truth|pg||
nt|xenya: interesting defence and play|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: The @DJ is indeed an entry ... but sadly for declarer, EW have 5 tricks to take|pg||
nt|twcho: so likely a +1 here|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|rv: well done Laltu (sry for India bias):)|pg||
nt|kastan88: may be even more than 2 IMps, tell how to find your 7 tricks here?|pg||

nt|iceblue: @C6=@H?|pg||
nt|iceblue: he shud play @S Hi-low, i think|pg||
nt|npcjpn: sure, and North knows South has @c632.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our match in round 3 in about 50 minutes: Japan v Chinese Taipei (women)|pg||
nt|npcjpn: if North watches spot card carefully:)|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: This kind of delay gives Souths grey hair!  :)|pg||

nt|super nova: "SELF BURNER"|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: still no auction from board 11 other room|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 11 well earned and very timely imps Japan|pg||
nt|kastan88: and curtains|pg||
nt|bucheister: this should be a lively board|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes but on current form unlikely John:)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the long draught for Japan finally breaks |pg||
nt|bucheister: Now that you are in England; have at old chum|pg||
nt|twcho: Indonesia is now getting the maximum VP out of their match against Bangledesh|pg||
nt|twcho: so I don't think the result of this match matters|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Walddk4: Our match in round 4 will be India v Sri Lanka (open). Dinner break first, so in 1 hour and 50 minutes|pg||
nt|rnmalik: no doubt, took the exit card away from E:)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: it was such a bad lead it cost 14 imps, 2 to go now|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 5 imps ona nothing hand, they do add up|pg||
mb|2S|nt|Walddk4: It's 6 pm (18.00) in China now|pg||
nt|npcjpn: 2@s = @s & a minor.|pg||
nt|kaz08833: actually still border slam because of bad trump break or minor suit ruff|pg||
nt|kastan88: Aussies very needed that 5 IMPs|pg||
mb|d|nt|rv: as score stands, india winning match 18-12, decent but would be below their expectations|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: cost the defence 7 imps, 2 to go|pg||
nt|twcho: another strange push|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: normally one would expect to see the top of the table clash in both divisions|pg||
nt|twcho: and the final match for the mighty Indonesian is playing against the not so strong Korea|pg||
mb|2N|nt|npcjpn: 3@c = pass or correct.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: how bad can a trump break be with 10|pg||
nt|kastan88: doesnt matter what to lead, if singleton S in South hand, same elimination|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes still need more but times almost up, not a very swinging set tonight Jaak|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: did she really think it necessary to lurch into 4@S?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: nearly :)|pg||
nt|twcho: 2nd last board|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: here's a big one |pg||
mb|p|nt|kaz08833: what if E had @HAJx?|pg||
mb|3C|nt|kiwi_joker: My grandmother defeats the slam  (she always leads an ace against them if she holds one)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Can 5@D make on a spade lead?|pg||
nt|suketbombi: knowing the agression may bid 5@S here|pg||
nt|lmeili: W may bid 5@s|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: in effect 12 as beating it is +5|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes several kibs point out cold on any lead with same line|pg||
nt|bucheister: that is a very aggressive bid by W|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: my dear friend Jaak seems unable to get back, his commentary has been great all day|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: or one that could affect thos placings|pg||
nt|twcho: You can find the running score at http://www.bridgeunlimited.com/bridge/DisplayResultsT4?club_event_id=15508&session=18&fdc=JRFROJVDG|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Something is wrong on 14|pg||
nt|djneill:  Michaels with 12 HCP, shocking|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 3NT made in both directions|pg||
nt|twcho: he has a perfect shape|pg||
mb|3S|nt|npcjpn: now EW can avoid to play 4-4 @s fit.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: slam chance Pakistan|pg||
mb|p|nt|bucheister: and it will payoff|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: aggressive being a psudonym :)|pg||
nt|twcho: a lucky slam here|pg||
nt|bucheister: is that score correct?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Operator, you entered the score in the wrong column|pg||
mb|4S|nt|npcjpn: only 11%.|pg||
nt|twcho: either 6@d, 6@s or 6NT all make|pg||
nt|twcho: seems best strain will be 6NT|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: E has reversed in respones they can hardly stop in game|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our next match in about 50 minutes is Indonesia v Japan (women) |pg||
nt|twcho: 6NT is the best slam here|pg||
nt|twcho: can they bid it|pg||
nt|twcho: yes, 6NT rates to be made|pg||
nt|twcho: good percentage|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the crowd waits with bated breath|pg||
nt|twcho: a chance for Pakistan|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: like when Belladonna bid 7@C with K10 onside|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Not that they will get there of course|pg||
nt|rv: way too many flat boards in this set, keep fingers crossed to get a real swingy last deal:)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: they call it drop dead stayman|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: S will pass any response|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|suketbombi: a relieved N :)|pg||
nt|lmeili: will u bid 3N with S' hand?|pg||
nt|xenya: enterprising double from E |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: unlikely play, so back to only making on bad lead|pg||
nt|kastan88: how to say, Mongolia China 111 IMPs in this set, but sure that is another case, and not need to compare|pg||
pc|cA|nt|kiwibridge: oh so sad|pg||
nt|twcho: a chance missed|pg||
nt|twcho: they have plenty in preserve it seems|pg||
nt|twcho: operator, please amend the score of bd 14 at this table|pg||
nt|twcho: thanks|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Done, ty|pg||
nt|vugraphzrc: sorry|pg||
nt|Walddk4: np|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thx Wu you've done an excellent job for us|pg||
pc|c4|nt|kiwibridge: strike oil in dummy|pg||
nt|twcho: but just stop in game level|pg||
pc|c5|nt|pelu: not so easy to play 5@D on a @s-lead from East|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: have we lost Jaak?|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|suketbombi: @D3?|pg||
nt|kastan88: but sure double dummy, not likely cashing SA, before throwing out in trumps, more per centage to play for 1CQ and @SK in same hand|pg||
nt|kastan88: or not?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: no @S missing two bullets imps come back|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thanks to our great operator Wu , the CCBA (Mr Song Zhao) and the APBF for making this broadcast possible, thanks also to Roland Wald and BBO for bringing to you, thanks Jaak great ...|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: commentary, and thanks all specs for your great feedback|pg||
nt|djneill:  looks doomed here|pg||
nt|djneill:  East's low @c is encouraging|pg||
pc|hT|nt|xenya: but perhaps just 2@H from W would have been enough? |pg||
nt|twcho: a similar auction to OR|pg||
nt|twcho: a very low scoring set|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: and manos?|pg||
nt|twcho: a @c continuation will certainly set the contract easily|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|bucheister: when she sees the spade story then will finesse a heart and go down an extra|pg||
nt|rnmalik: If W can finesse or guess the Q@H, would be good play on @D.|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|pg||
nt|npcjpn: if you can guess both red suits, you can make 6@D.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Maybe it needs a club finesse to the 10|pg||
nt|bucheister: most would rebid 4S with her hand|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: so in the end a big win for C-T after a positive start by NZ|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Jane assists with a no reason double|pg||
nt|bucheister: might be right to play a heart here; the only card to beat this is the HA|pg||
nt|bucheister: ok|pg||
nt|bucheister: partner might also have a singleton heart on the auction|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s6|nt|rv: this event is held in Port city of Northern China|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: wow they made the cards swing for them :)|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|Walddk4: Ruff spade, heart to hand, club to the 10|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I'll be back tomorrow for the final matches, do hope you can join me|pg||
nt|twcho: but still dummy don't have 3 entries to finesse in @s|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Then I think you have 11 tricks|pg||
nt|twcho: so he is destined to lose 2 trumps and one in each minor|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: running 8 would have been good|pg||
nt|twcho: east can cover with 9|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Last round  Indonesia v Korea  and  Chinese Taipei v Australia, so Indonesia must be fancied|pg||
nt|twcho: the spot cards in @s has made the contract impossible to make|pg||
nt|djneill:  West rising with the @dA saves TWO tricks, not just one - so much for 2nd hand low|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Bangladesh have scored 2 imps to stall Indonesias momentum|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sybarra: E made one more try in the open room |pg||
pc|h5|nt|rv: Ning Bo|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h9|pg||
nt|bucheister: I think it was a desparate double out of frustration by S|pg||
nt|Walddk4: And Mongolia is still without a single VP in a real match|pg||
nt|Walddk4: They got 18 for a bye|pg||
nt|djneill:  they are just pawn in game of bridge|pg||
nt|bucheister: they probably had more fun|pg||
pc|d8|nt|suketbombi: should give a @H relief now|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Cant 9@D missing.|pg||
pc|d6|nt|suketbombi: good defence |pg||
nt|djneill:  no doubt!|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d9|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|bucheister: that is playing for down one; the extra under trick is worth 13 imps gamble|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: China wins the match quite easily one board to go|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Losing 0-25 in 18 matches can't be much fun|pg||

pc|s2|pc|h8|pg||

nt|kastan88: was 2S+2|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: loong way to go before we can get an indication of where medals are going|pg||
nt|psridhar: i just saw the auction in the other room this bd- it went 1h-1n-2c-2s-.....and a strange 5c|pg||
nt|kastan88: as demonstrated|pg||
mb|1S|nt|sybarra: the bid that E hated to hear,  X!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and to the PABF and CCBA for letting us in|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: changed to making we just need the +2|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thanks to John and Shirley for great comments, thx operator and specs for your great feedback, join me the Kiwi again in about 90 minutes for the next round|pg||
nt|twcho: another pedestrian 4@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|npcjpn: multi, pass or correct, and takeout double.|pg||
nt|super nova: ho ho.|pg||
nt|xenya: double presumably shows an unknown long suit|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: and special thanks to Nick for sending and interpeting his dad's cc|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thx operator, and so our last for the match and the day.|pg||
mb|2C|nt|sybarra: and this E puts it back pard |pg||
nt|sybarra: in our room,  e/w was playing precision |pg||
nt|bucheister: Playing a strong club sometimes partner will just bid a game with a full opening bid; this may not b e the perfect example but they are stuck many imps|pg||
nt|suketbombi: you have to give up on such a good @C suit when u open 1 Nt on this hand|pg||
nt|kastan88: same words from me, tx to spectators for right comments, tx to fellow commentator Gary.|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: hope it was not doubled?|pg||
nt|psridhar: yes N leaped all the way to 5c over 2s|pg||
nt|rv: is it a misclick by Vugraph operator because auction looks unreal|pg||
nt|psridhar: i thk no game makes -may be 4H |pg||
nt|kastan88: what is time at your Gary?|pg||
nt|djneill:  stamina plays a big role at the end of these events|pg||
mb|2N|nt|lmeili: suprised W did'nt transfer to 2@h|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes surprising indeed no body here got his suit in:)|pg||
nt|lmeili: NS can make their 3N now|pg||
nt|suketbombi: :)|pg||
nt|super nova: most likly 8 tricks.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: a complicated hand, difficult to stay away from 4@S.|pg||
nt|npcjpn: after a diamond lead, if declarer plays a club before a spade..|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: I presume its actually South who is in 1NT|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Or maybe East.|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Or somebody|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: operator??|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I'll be here tomorrow and hope you can join me|pg||
nt|bucheister: Thanks Gary; enjoyed it|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the 4@SX+1 again a flat board :)|pg||
nt|twcho: so 3@c is puppet stayman|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: so the 1 @C could have none, and E tried 2 @H |pg||
nt|npcjpn: took out in 3-card suit.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: last board and 8 the difference that probably won't change|pg||
mb|3N|nt|twcho: 3@d deny 5 card M but promise 4M|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: PABF is now APBF, sorry|pg||
nt|rv: world's most popular contract makes right?|pg||
nt|psridhar: in 4h u take a spd ruff, concede 1sp+1h+1c=|pg||
nt|rv: 2@s, 4@h, 2@c and 1@d for 9 tricks in 3n|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: we have 5 more rounds over the weekend I'll be here for all of them, it's just 10pm  now I could do another set now|pg||
nt|twcho: very bad defense by west|pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: should have played the queen makes it like the lead was form KL3|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Mr Song Zhao from the CCBA has been instrumental in setting up a fine show. Many thanks to him|pg||
nt|suketbombi: a signal for @D:)|pg||
nt|xenya: but i'm at a loss as to what E's double means|pg||
nt|xenya: so penalty...|pg||
nt|kastan88: so must be very late for players and operators,  is understandable mistakes after long working day|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: sry yes 3nt shd make easily|pg||
nt|twcho: and let the contract go thru|pg||
pc|d8|nt|h_karluk: Hi Vladimir, 1st D ok but i am afraid 2nd D idea wld b a trouble with such poor values, so far declarer wld have no difficulty to bring the contract home|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes, thx all spectators for watching and thx Jaak you made great commentary|pg||
nt|twcho: 3@h shows 4 cards in @s|pg||
nt|twcho: and that is it|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: NZ is having a great win :) Chinese Taipei up 130 to NIL|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Dan, John, Tommy, Diane and Roland thx for your great comments, Wu our operator has done an excellent job|pg||
nt|djneill:  how best to play this one|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thanks all spectators for your great feedback|pg||
nt|bucheister: thanks enjoyed everyone|pg||
nt|deltadash: it's been fun everyone, thanks|pg||
nt|djneill:  1@d was precision, so East is not leading "their suit" necessarily|pg||
pc|d2|nt|Walddk4: Today's last match in 1 hour and 38 minutes|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Choo loses the plot big time here :(|pg||
pc|dT|nt|robinswr: KJ3|pg||
nt|sybarra: can N "see" the South diamond holding?|pg||
nt|xenya: however 2@S should play quite well here |pg||
nt|kaz08833: seems another swing|pg||
nt|mwigor: in china its around 6pm i think|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: also Frank Budai who joined us for a while|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: our next match is in 40 minutes we don't know who will be featured|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thanks to the CCBA (Mr Song Zhao) and the APBF for making this broadcast possible, thanks also to Roland Wald and BBO for bringing to you, |pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|Walddk4: This is the last board of the match, thanks to our flawless operator Xu Li, and PABF and CCBA for the show|pg||
nt|psridhar: over 2c, Ashok goel found the technically correct 2s....|pg||
nt|kastan88: still, played lot of today :)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|rv: I would have bid 3n with South hand after partner's 2n possibly showing 16-17|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h2|nt|kiwibridge: on H run 9 tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Back in about 1 hour with the last match of the tournament|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|xenya: possibly 9 tricks can be made|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: win run J@H|pg||
nt|npcjpn: 3 heart tricks only, so needs a club finesse.|pg||
nt|kaz08833: or normally @S?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: or just give N @S + 2D|pg||
nt|npcjpn: test @c first , then @s finesse is a normal play.|pg||
pc|h8|nt|Walddk4: India vs Sri Lanka (open teams)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: maybe only -3|pg||
nt|bucheister: it is always correct to lead a trump on these auctions; even the stiff J|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: indeed|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: that would be a top lead|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|Walddk4: Also thanks to our commentators, Nobuyuki and Alywn and Steve|pg||
nt|Walddk4: welcome back then|pg||
pc|hA|nt|kiwibridge: 8@D may be SP for @S|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|psridhar: hard to explain that leap to 5c|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I should have added by much :)|pg||
nt|twcho: who can find the @sK lead|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|bucheister: I can|pg||
pc|c3|nt|kiwibridge: thx Tommy nice to see you again :)|pg||
pc|c5|nt|h_karluk: the declarer has enough  entries to enjoy club suit|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: that is declarer committing hari kari I feel|pg||
nt|twcho: and please send my best regards to all New Zealanders|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Indonesia V Japan women I'm told|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Next match in about 35 minutes|pg||
nt|npcjpn: but it seems normal to hope @c 3-2 or @s finesse working.|pg||
nt|djneill:  that's a backwash rabbi|pg||
pc|c6|nt|npcjpn: now at least one down?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: has cut his own comms channel |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: compresses 1 trick|pg||
pc|c7|nt|Walddk4: Japan v Chinese Taipei (women)|pg||
nt|kastan88: well earned 13 IMPs for singapure in opened room, I hope that was they played right on 3rd trick: after ducking spade lead taking 2nd @S  in hand and playing @H10 for J finesse ...|pg||
nt|kastan88: from East hand. This working against @H entry in long spades hand in East hand, and later declarer can check for diamond lay-out, if they are 4-1, may throw in with 4th @D or ...|pg||
nt|kastan88: eliminate or|pg||
nt|kastan88: diamonds and hearts and throw in with clubs|pg||
nt|xenya: so likely a huge swing to Singapore  |pg||
nt|kastan88: and, Gary, you said, not many swings in this set? :)|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|rv: Rex's 3@h seems to be a gross underbid here though I wouldn't have bid 2n with KP's hand|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: it's been a great 1st APBF from where I am sitting and hopefully for the players also, I know they have been helped with accomodation which is great for the self funded Kiwis|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|npcjpn: you mean @s discard.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|kiwibridge: thx, we got off lightly and are thankful|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cT|nt|npcjpn: oops|pg||
nt|xenya: a decider|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thanks also to the CCBA (Mr Song Zhao) and the APBF for making this broadcast possible, to Roland Wald and BBO for bringing to you, and thanks all specs for your great feedback|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: that last was unexpected|pg||
pc|c4|nt|kiwibridge: thx all spectators @H come back in 40 @H|pg||
nt|twcho: another imp to Indonesia so the result will be 20:10 VP|pg||
nt|twcho: maybe crucial to Indonesia|pg||
nt|twcho: but even so, declarer will score 9 tricks, right?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|rv: thanks to Vugraph operator and my fellow commentators|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d5|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: final results all matches at http://www.bridgeunlimited.com/bridge/ViewMasterEvent2?code=10ASIA&header=pabf|pg||
pc|d3|nt|vugraphzrc: tks all|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|nt|robinswr: two for one sale get two of opponents trumps for one of yours|pg||
nt|robinswr: this is what happens when you bid when long in the opponents suit|pg||
nt|rv: a big thanks to Roland, organisers and all specs|pg||
nt|h_karluk: would ruff, and draw last trump, then wld claim|pg||
nt|kastan88: tx Vladimir, have to go, well done operator and good night kibbitzers|pg||
nt|djneill:  yep|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|xenya: thanks everyone|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|psridhar: partnerships shd discuss these raises of short minors- a popular method is 2s = 4 card bal raise preparing for 3nt; and jump to 3 lev new suit=5 + card raise + values in bid suit|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes indeed all  vital|pg||
pc|h7|pc|d7|nt|kiwibridge: a tough hand for declarer to finish on a sad note|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thx all see you in an hour, go the Kiwi ladies :)|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Thanks to all specs for watching|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Thanks all, bye for now|pg||
mc|10|nt|psridhar: over 2c i mean|pg||
nt|rv: I presume India will lose 6 IMPs here winning the match by 9 IMPs and score of 17-13|pg||
nt|djneill:  thanks roland, thanks all|pg||
nt|deltadash: Bye all|pg||
nt|twcho: one imps to CT and the final score is 16:14 VP I suppose|pg||
nt|twcho: this is far from enough to win the title|pg||
nt|twcho: thanks everyone|pg||
nt|twcho: the last round will be one hour from now|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: tough last round, c-t or indonesia who will prevail|pg||
nt|twcho: Indonesia is the hot favorite now|pg||
pg||
