nt|ralfwil: of course it´s a style of bidding, but on these two boards I cannot understand the first pass and also missed game|pg||
nt|chick: regardless of who is in which chair, EW bid a lot on not very much value, and NS didn't get into the auction in time to find it|pg||

nt|ralfwil: and N can act immediately and avoid further problems|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h7|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||

nt|ralfwil: D or downgrade to 1nt|pg||
nt|chick: 1N probably better I think|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s2|nt|chick: kibs say 1N, or wait and bid 2@H after 2@D|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|chick: in my opinion,   1@D P 1@H 2@H should be natural|pg||
nt|chick: for exactly this reason .... in today's methods, the 1@H bid can be 4 hearts 5432, and you need a way to show a real heart suit in 4th seat (same for 2@D being natural as well)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: You cannot tell about 18P after a first pass in my opinion|pg||
nt|chick: looking at all 4 hands, we can see that nunes can draw trump and run the hearts, but he can't see that the @HJ is dropping|pg||

mb|p|nt|h_karluk: as Bob read it|pg||
nt|mamos: not necessarily Hamdi  may be cue|pg||
nt|h_karluk: if Bob would open 1N then things would be easy, ie uncontested 1N>3@h mild slam invite for clubs|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that'|pg||
nt|h_karluk: s also true Mike|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so there's not a novel layout problem, but the matter is to tell yr clubs to partner|pg||
nt|mamos: if you play $C@C for @H and @d for @S  makes sense to play the other way round too|pg||
nt|h_karluk: sure, you know it all depends partnership agreements|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and you are not sure about @c A, K|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|nt|h_karluk: if you roll the dice and bid slam then in the newspapers, if goes down would feel worst, because the players there know their business very well|pg||

nt|h_karluk: I don't think anyone has the luxury to take an adventure |pg||
nt|h_karluk: still 6NT, presumably very hard to lead a @d from KJx ternace|pg||

nt|h_karluk: which in practice as i said very very hard to lead from that KJ9 tenace to set it|pg||
nt|oliverc: indeed|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i believe they were not reading the same book (Bob&Zia)|pg||
