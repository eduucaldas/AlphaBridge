mb|p|mb|p|pc|hA|nt|hedyg: 2@s enough with that hand imo|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|pc|hT|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes he has a doubleton @d, but do you want to ruff with AKQ?|pg||
nt|flash: this form of scoring is, essentially, super-matchpoints; it favors a very conservative approach - no pushing to bid games; try to preserve the plus|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sQ|pc|s8|pc|s4|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|nt|Walddk2: 2@S surely nog enough, could be 5-6 points with a doubleton spade|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c7|pg||
nt|Walddk2: *not|pg||
nt|hedyg: i mean 1@s-p-2@s Roland :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: without bidding 1NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But that would not show this hand in their methods|pg||
nt|hedyg: a constructive 2@s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You can't change their agreement all of a sudden|pg||
nt|Walddk2: just because you like it better|pg||
nt|hedyg: if they play 2/1 it would be constructive, no?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But don't you alllow for individual agreements?|pg||
nt|hedyg: sure i do and i dont know theirs|pg||

nt|flash: we're trying to get Round 1 scores for you, folks; pls bear with us|pg||
nt|warrens:  playing for 3-3 clubs is safe, since giving up a club ruff gets back a diamond ruff for declarer, so same number of tricks|pg||

pc|cK|nt|flash: so 3@D showed at least 1 4-card major; Levin showed a 4-card @H suit|pg||
mc|10|nt|brolucius: Puppet Stayman (asking for five-card majors) is more useful when you play a strong 1NT. That's because most hands with a five -card major, 5-3-3-2 shape and 15-17 points, are ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: opened 1NT. With 12-14 points and that shape, you would not normally open a weak 1NT.|pg||

pc|c5|nt|flash: and a big guess at trick 1|pg||
nt|brolucius: With the @CK and @DA, West is happy to play no-trumps rather than a potential 6-2 spade fit.|pg||

pc|d3|pc|h6|pc|s3|pg||
pc|sT|pc|c7|pc|h7|pc|s7|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|brolucius: Yes. Remember that all the scoring is match-points, even though the partners/teams arrangements change from segment to segment.|pg||
nt|mamos: and only ten point diff  wins the board|pg||
pc|c9|pc|h3|pc|h2|pg||
pc|sA|pc|h9|pc|c4|nt|brolucius: In this first segment the players are arranged as a pair with their normal partner. They face five different pairs from the other team, eventually comparing their results against ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: just one pre-set pair from the other team. Whichever pair scores most match-points in that comparison picks up 4 Buffett Points for their side.|pg||

nt|flash: and the defense slips to allow the extra overtrick|pg||
nt|flash: but, it's a grosvenor of sorts|pg||
nt|brolucius: Levin may have used Restricted Choice for that heart play, reasoning that North was more likely to hold A-Q or A-J rather than Q-J.|pg||
nt|brolucius: South surely has no problem with his return at Trick 12, so the communications may have gone again.|pg||
nt|flash: if North held the @HA, surely he would have kept it singleton, along with Ace and a @C?|pg||
nt|flash: or 2 @CS, if South had led from AQ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: In the first match of this event, I was watching at the table where Brogeland/Saelensminde faced Zia/Hamman (yes, a good table to watch). Brogeland reached 6@D and was at the most ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: interesting point when.....  we lost it all. So, I have had to send him an email to enquire how he managed to make 920. |pg||

pc|sK|nt|brolucius: In his later years Reese use to make disapproving noises whenever anyone used Stayman, even on 4-4-3-2 shape.  ("How absurd!" he would say.)|pg||
pc|c5|pc|s4|pc|s6|pg||
nt|flash: this will fail on the @C position, but 4@S wouldn't have fared any better|pg||
pc|s8|pc|c6|pc|sQ|pc|s9|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sT|pc|s7|nt|brolucius: His argument was that you gave away information to the defenders when no fit was found, and might be better off in NT anyway. But he carried the argument to extremes and few agreed ...|pg||

nt|warrens:  but it doesn't matter, no way for W to find another trick|pg||

mb|p|nt|flash: last board now; we'd hope to have all tables up and the paired tables linked for Board-a-Match (Point-a-Board) scoring|pg||
nt|flash: i'm sure Alan and the rest of the folks in Wales will be trying to get us back in one piece|pg||
nt|brolucius: I have heard players say that 2@S should show a five-card suit now because West cannot hold four spades. What nonsense! East would be simply describing his own hand.|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: people working hard to get IT issues sorted, i promise :)|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk4: This is the last board of round 2|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Resuming in 1 hour and 10 minutes|pg||
nt|brolucius: East would like better spades for 2@S, which would suggest the same values that 3@D did.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hopefully all will be well by then|pg||
nt|flash: again; 10 top tricks and no real chance for more (or less)|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: fingers crossed!|pg||
nt|petergill: That means that in Round 1, Auken - von Arnim and Sementa - Duboin won for Europe (4 points), but USA won the other two matches. |pg||
nt|brolucius: Crossing fingers is sometimes very unreliable (particularly when you are in a 4-3 fit).|pg||
