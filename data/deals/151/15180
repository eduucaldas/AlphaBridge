mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mrdct: 1NT will probably score better than 2@s|pg||
nt|kastan88:  hi Dave, welcome|pg||
pc|c9|nt|mrdct: in fact with @s 3-3 and A onside 3NT might make|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c8|nt|mrdct: this is shaping up to be the same 9 tricks in 2@s as NT would|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Hello everyone!|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c2|pc|cT|pc|cA|pg||
nt|mrdct: expect the players to be working hard for every possible trick in BAM scoring|pg||

mb|1D|nt|kastan88:  slam time now|pg||
mb|d|nt|mrdct: looks like USA are making an overtrick in the same contract in the comparison room (sontag-berkowitz v duboin-sementa)|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|mrdct: score is 2-2|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|ralfwil: If NS bid 6@d, the play is easy after west´s double|pg||
nt|mrdct: might be able to make a slam here squeezing west in the black suits|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ralfwil: agree Dave, but the D tells a lot|pg||
mb|p|nt|kastan88:  and of course West's double is helpful here|pg||
nt|mrdct: 1@h looks like 4+ @s|pg||
nt|mrdct: fairly standard treatment in expert circles|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|mrdct: i'm not really sure what 4@h should be though|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mrdct: 4@h might be ace asking|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|kastan88:  they know better than we, what they are doing :)|pg||
nt|mrdct: the play is interesting here|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 6nt is also a rather easy contract after a @c lead and a duck for a squeeze tempo|pg||
nt|mrdct: same contract in the other room|pg||
nt|kastan88:  looked for Hampson-Gitelman system/CC nowhere to find in internet|pg||
nt|mrdct: in 6@D he has an extra option of @SK in east|pg||
nt|ralfwil: no score yet on board 2|pg||
nt|mrdct: board 2 was a win for USA|pg||
nt|mrdct: i think the odds favour placing the @sK with the guy who made a vul t/o dbl|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c3|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|mrdct: so he's ducking this to rectify the count|pg||
nt|mrdct: and now west is dead in the water on the simple squeeze in the black suits|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hK|pc|h2|pc|h4|pg||
nt|mrdct: gitelman might even claim now as he's put all his eggs un that basket|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d8|pc|dA|pc|d6|pg||
pc|dK|pc|c2|pc|d3|pc|h3|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C|nt|mrdct: so score is 3-3 now|pg||
mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kastan88:  1@C=16+|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|mrdct: hampson sticking his neck out|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mrdct: excellent spot for NS|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|ralfwil: N gave EW a chance to find their @s fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: although NS may have done better defending 1NT as 2@s looks to make|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mrdct: and i think 1NT is in trouble|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|nt|mrdct: hard to fault NS here for competing - generally it's a winning strategy to push your up a level or two|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h5|pg||
nt|kastan88:  The website for the competition is  www.buffettcup.com . Please visit the site for Daily Bulletins, Running Scores, the convention cards for the Individual and other information.|pg||
nt|mrdct: all hope is not lost for NS of course. trumps are 4-1 and @CKQ are offside so declarer has a lot of work to do|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|pc|d8|pc|d9|pg||
nt|mrdct: a cross ruff might be the best line but need to be ruffing high in dummy|pg||
nt|mrdct: a bit easier now with that winning @d pip as only one @d ruff required and no need to risk double hooking the @c suit|pg||
nt|kastan88:  this diamond trick probably tells to west about bad trump break|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree Jaak! N has shown at least 8 red cards|pg||
nt|mrdct: 1NT failed in the other room so 2 points for Europe if this makes|pg||

nt|mrdct: south has both majors|pg||
mb|1D|mb|2D|nt|mrdct: 4@s the limit for NS but EW have a good save in 5@D|pg||
mb|3D|mb|d|nt|mrdct: no sacrifice taken in the other room where the italians bid and made 4@s|pg||
mb|3S|nt|kastan88:  seems NS playing some Precision kind system, as that is usual for Hampson with his regular partner Greco|pg||
nt|mrdct: 5@d might be one of those really good saves that actually makes|pg||
nt|ralfwil: possible for EW to find 5@d now|pg||
mb|4C|nt|kastan88:  probably 1@D= 11..16 2+@D|pg||
mb|4S|mb|5C|nt|mrdct: EW certainly sound like they are in the business of competing on this hand|pg||
mb|d|mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mrdct: and east has converted to the superior @D contract|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dQ|nt|mrdct: hampson had little choice but to bid 5@s as he knows he isn't going to get rich doubling 5@D|pg||
pc|dT|nt|mrdct: no where to dump the @H loser so this can't possible make. europe 7-3|pg||
nt|kastan88:  that's pressure with BAM scoring, you must win every board|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cQ|pc|cA|pc|c2|pg||
nt|mrdct: it is an extreme rare form of scoring in my part of the world. no major events use it and there might be a handful of poorly attended state events using BAM scoring|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|mrdct: 3NT could win the board|pg||
nt|mrdct: which is sometimes indicated at BAM or MP when all of the side suits are double stopped|pg||
mb|3S|nt|mrdct: 2@c either checkback or puppet|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mrdct: not sure which|pg||
mb|p|nt|mrdct: normal contract which should make with 2 out of 3 finesses working|pg||

mb|1S|mb|d|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mrdct: this is the sort of hand where you would quite likely bid 3NT at imps but a BAM you will be a bit more conservative|pg||
