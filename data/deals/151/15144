nt|jbgood: well put David, a less than perfect defense may even allow 3 spades to make|pg||

nt|tomi2: I dont like the double of 3@D, for me it does not show Kjxx, its just for the lead, think one should bid something to committ the partnership to 4th level to show the willing to ...|pg||

pc|s2|nt|roswolf: except north bid 3@S rather than 4@C|pg||
nt|brolucius: Not unreasonable for North to bid strongly on his hand, which has potential. 3@S by North at the other table was a bit on the cautious side.|pg||

nt|Walddk2: I like one of the team names in Group U, "She goes to bed at 8"   :)|pg||

mb|p|mb|3S|an|!|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|tomi2: seemy both tables will sell the W hand as strong balanced. I think one could open 1@D|pg||
nt|tomi2: both black suits are stopped but the stops dont run away|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|c4|nt|petergill: Consus is EW's sponsor - a major company in Poland - Consus is involved in emissions trading schemes or something like that|pg||

pc|cQ|pg||
pc|dA|nt|roswolf: strong with 5 spades apparently|pg||
pc|d8|nt|roswolf: fell short - indeed not as easy as it seems|pg||
nt|petergill: 4NT RKCB should in my opinion be followed by 5NT by South, to let North know that NS has all the keycards and trump queen|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d3|pg||
pc|dK|pc|h2|pc|d4|pc|d5|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's on a finesse, not that fortunate|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Must finesse spades to make it|pg||
nt|henryb:  needs the @s finesse. and a little luck in a pointed suit: either 3-3 @s or @d coming home|pg||
nt|jbgood: cllose your eyes and open them again after the spade jack wins:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: but lots off if finesse is wrong|pg||
nt|tomi2: in 5@D you lose two aces but can survive without finesses|pg||
pc|sA|nt|brolucius: South had the option, presumably, of bidding 5NT after his 4NT. This would tell partner that all the key cards were held and invite him to bid a grand slam. |pg||
pc|s2|nt|petergill: Then North might bid the grand. |pg||
pc|s3|pc|s4|pg||
nt|roswolf: whereas 5@D is gin|pg||

nt|tomi2: west saw akqxx @D when he opened the bidding|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|mb|2N|an|minors|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: East is one of the world's greatest players. His website is http://www.martensuniversity.com/. |pg||
nt|brolucius: North's 2@H means that he want to go no higher (understandably) if South's major is hearts.|pg||
mb|p|pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|c8|pc|cT|pg||
nt|petergill: Martens' books and training are highly recommended - some of his books have been translated into English|pg||
nt|brolucius: South doubles 3@H to tell partner that this is his suit. If he omitted to do this, North might on some auctions bid high in spades, assuming that South held spades.|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c9|pc|c3|pc|cK|pg||
pc|sK|nt|brolucius: It seems to me that East's 3@H was a bit risky, since it might have been read as natural (with South's suit not yet known). But West held hearts and did not raise so they clearly ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: knew what they were doing.|pg||
nt|petergill: At least 1100 looks achievable if East can double 2@H for take-out and West converts to penalty|pg||
nt|jbgood: perhaps it would have paid off to double 2 hearts? |pg||
nt|jbgood: unlucky lead|pg||
pc|d4|pc|s2|pc|sA|pg||
pc|dK|nt|brolucius: Perhaps that would have shown hearts?|pg||
nt|petergill: At both tables, the vulnerable penalty was not taken|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|nt|jbgood: even clearer to double by E in the other room...|pg||
nt|petergill: I think 2HX is only 1100 - trump promotion for 1400 is not available, I think|pg||

pc|h8|pc|h2|nt|petergill: The top Italians would just overcall 1@H on the grounds that the flat 6322 shape (no singleton nor void) is unsuitable for vulnerable premption. |pg||

mb|1S|mb|2H|nt|brolucius: At least his singleton was in the suit that had been overcalled, which suggested that partner's values would be in the other three suits - just where they were needed.|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphpl2: gajcyk chcial grac 2@d z X|pg||
nt|roswolf: this looks a push in 4@H|pg||
nt|petergill: Consus Oil's sponsorship of bridge is thanks to Piotr Wasiak, I think |pg||
mb|2S|nt|brolucius: North might consider a slam opposite a 2NT opening, but not opposite a strong 1NT.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|tomi2: polish standards for 2 over 1 overcalls are quiet low, I would pass that hand. qtz73 cries for trapping pass and reopening double|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3nt is a fair shot here|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|petergill: Heading for a flat board here|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: Consus just scored another big swing|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphpl2: odpytuja sie z systemu|pg||
nt|tomi2: and if we make game, i pass and west will pass to, partner will reopen with double or 1nt. if he cant reopen we are favortes to have no game on|pg||

nt|roswolf: and my fellow commentators restart in 15 mins|pg||
nt|jbgood: so long|pg||
nt|roswolf: bye for now|pg||
nt|brolucius: The second big swing to Consus was on the 4@H hand that was apparently misplayed by declarer here too, but let through by North.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer was allowed to go down at the other table.|pg||
nt|vugraphzqn: see you in 15 minutes...thx all...|pg||
nt|petergill: Interesting to see how the swing to Consus on Bd 7 arose - in 4@H Martens seemed to keep more options open in the play and gained a major swing when trumps broke 4-1|pg||
nt|petergill: Not at all easy to know how to play that 4@h on Bd 7|pg||
nt|petergill: Bye all|pg||

nt|jcwla: So a push there.|pg||
nt|othered1: So far, though a match and a half, Conusu White has played very solidly|pg||
mb|1S|nt|othered1: Consus White, that is.|pg||
mb|2H|nt|jcwla: Those look like four spades to me.|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|othered1: I agree, but they may not have an alternative way to handle the hand with this shape unless they also promise longer, say, @D|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|othered1: with north's @S length, NT looks quite attractive|pg||

nt|Walddk2: They are from Munich I am told|pg||
nt|vugraphzqn: hii all...welcome back to Pula...|pg||
mb|3C|nt|tomi2: "Consus" is something, that I saw often in Poland but should be much more all over the world. In other countries single persons are sponsor of teams, here they have found some ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: multinational company that runs a bridge team!|pg||
mb|d|nt|Walddk2: We will be starting with boards 7 and 8 in this room, followed by comparisons from the other table when we circle back to board 1|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|roswolf: well that looks strong|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|cQ|nt|tomi2: Consus is trading with CO2 emission rights and sponsor a whole Bridge team, like vodafone sponsors manchester united|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Used to, they don't any more|pg||
nt|Walddk2: MU have AON now|pg||
nt|henryb:  East would have done best to pass 3@cX|pg||
pc|c8|nt|vugraphpl2: gajcyk wypytuje o licytacje|pg||
nt|brolucius: If they are playing Polish Club, 1@C may be a strong hand but is more likely to be based on a weak 1NT (if they rebid 1NT).|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@H maybe?|pg||
nt|roswolf: here definitely strong!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's not necessarily strong. Polish Club 1@C is ... 1. 12-14 balanced (often) - 2. 15+ with clubs - 3. Any 18+ hand|pg||
pc|c9|nt|roswolf: true|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is 3.|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dT|nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@D is 0-7|pg||
pc|dA|nt|brolucius: West decides he is not worth anything stronger than 4@H (such as 4@C, splinter) because East limited his hand with the 1@D response.|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|roswolf: and a diamond switch!?|pg||
nt|tomi2: they send two teams to Pula it seems. North is Krzystof Martens, he wrote several books in the past years, if you are an advanced or expert player and want to improve your game, ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: think about his books|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|henryb:  3@c goes down 4, which is even better than the lucky slam|pg||
pc|h5|nt|Walddk2: 1@S can still be a weak NT and is forcing|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@H obviously confirms the 18+ hand|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sA|nt|roswolf: trump is even better|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|nt|roswolf: indeed but east took a normal view i think|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|tomi2: As far as I remember this Consus squad won Australian Nationals earlier this year|pg||

mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|othered1: NOte that in OR, south preempted 3@C and west doubled, not a call everyone would make.  East bid simple 4@H|pg||
