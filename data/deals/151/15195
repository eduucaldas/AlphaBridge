pc|s8|nt|mamos: Zia knows what he has   we know what he has   |pg||
nt|oliverc: -1 now|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mamos: but Bob clearly did not|pg||
nt|h_karluk: which in practice as i said very very hard to lead from that KJ9 tenace to set it|pg||
nt|oliverc: indeed|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i believe they were not reading the same book (Bob&Zia)|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|mamos: or perhaps he did and risked 6NT   not inconceivable at this form of scoring|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ok declarer claims|pg||

pc|c9|pc|c5|nt|lestergold: now they need merely to defend accurately notm difficult on the elad and its 1 off is very good bridge!|pg||
nt|lestergold: North of course had ideal shape and at this form of scoring the vulnerability is much less relevant unless you are liekly to be doubled for the 200 kiss of death|pg||
