mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: Good afternoon all|pg||
nt|jcwla: Welcome to the Miskin Manor hotel, near Cardiff in Wales, for the 3rd edition of the Warren Buffett Bridge Cup. This contest has the concept of golfs Ryder Cup and is scheduled to ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: coincide, as closely as possible, with it. |pg||
nt|psridhar: hi all welcome :)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|jcwla: The competing teams, from Europe and the United States, consist of 12 players each and include one Womens pair and five Open pairs.|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: For Europe, NPC Paul Hackett of England has selected Sabine Auken & Daniela von Arnim, Germany, Boye Brogeland & Erik Saelensminde, Geir Helgemo & Tor Helness, Norway, Giorgio ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: Duboin & Antonio Sementa, Fulvio Fantoni & Claudio Nunes, Italy, and Jason & Justin Hackett, England.|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|nt|jcwla: For the USA, NPC Donna Compton has chosen David Berkowitz & Alan Sontag, Bob Hamman & Zia Mahmood, Bobby Levin & Steve Weinstein, Jill Levin & Jill Meyers, Jeff Meckstroth & Eric ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: Rodwell, and Geoff Hampson & Fred Gitelman.|pg||
nt|jcwla: The competition includes Pairs, Teams and an Individual. All events are scored at Board-A-Match (Point-A-Board). In this form of scoring, there are only 3 scores available: a win, ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: a tie and a loss. Any difference in the score, no matter how small, decides the board. We will have 6 tables in play at all times.|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|jcwla: Essentially, this becomes Super-Matchpoints: every overtrick, every undertrick, the difference between playing in No Trump versus a Major may decide the board.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@D is constructive|pg||
nt|jcwla: For simplicity, we are using the European style of 2 points for a win, 1 point for a tie and 0 points for a loss.|pg||
nt|jcwla: We are starting with the Pairs competition. Each pair has drawn a pair from the other team, with whom their scores will be compared.  Each pair will play an 11-board match against ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: each of the remaining five pairs from the opposing team.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: note South's response on a 1-count |pg||
nt|jcwla: Next up will be the Teams competition. The captains assign each pair to one of three teams. They will play a double round-robin of 14-board rounds, for a total of six matches.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Finally, we will have the Individual. Each player has drawn a player from the other team, with whom their scores will be compared. Each player partners each of the other eleven ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: players on their team for a short set (6 boards) against various partnerships from the other team.  Each team has agreed on a standard convention card for this event.|pg||
mb|4S|nt|jcwla: The overall competition is scored at "Buffett Points". Each match/set from each event has been assigned a point value, based on the number of boards involved. The Pairs and Teams ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: will have 4 BPs at stake for each match; the Individual will have 2 BPs at stake for each match.|pg||
nt|jcwla: This leaves 60 Buffett Points to be contested for the Pairs, 72 for the Teams and 66 for the Individual. With 198 total BPs at stake, the first team to 100 points wins the trophy. ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: If the teams tie with 99 BPs each, Europe, as holders, will retain the Cup.|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|nt|jtr: Check the result please operator|pg||
nt|vugraphzrd: -1 correct.|pg||
mb|2H|nt|athene: we might see a bit of system gadgetry here - some play 2@H to show that west hand|pg||
nt|jtr: ty|pg||
nt|Gerben42: that's possible losing 3@S but ducking trick 1 did not happen|pg||
nt|athene: the point being, if you bid 1@S, you might miss a 4-4 heart fit, if partner is not strong enough to reverse|pg||
nt|Gerben42: excellent agreement that|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: because 1@D 1@S; 2@D - 2@H is forcing which might take you too high|pg||
nt|Gerben42: its worse with 5422 then 1@D 1@S 2@C ugh...|pg||
nt|jtr: Well, they may get too high anyway|pg||
nt|athene: now Levin will be thinking about 3nt|pg||
nt|Gerben42: just try 3N I guess|pg||
nt|athene: but club lead might be slightly worrying if partner has a singleton|pg||
nt|Gerben42: unless its 5-8 HCP then she might invite and get turned down|pg||
nt|jtr: Depends on the range of 2@h|pg||
nt|athene: some play 2@H as 5-4 or 5-5|pg||
nt|athene: so east might check back to find a possible 5-3 heart fit|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|athene: of course 1@D - 1@S; 2NT would be awkward too with that west hand unless you play something very fancy over 2NT|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|athene: Maybe Levin will just bid 3NT anyway - "the @C9 made me do it, officer"|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Gerben42: Brogeland played 5@S carefully and won the board - but 3NT would be the jackpot for 460|pg||
nt|athene: at imps i don't think we would be playing this board in a partscore|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c2|pc|cJ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|jtr: Like only 10 tricks in NT on the previous with a @d lead|pg||

pc|sK|nt|athene: ah ok|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|athene: wow, really the king?|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c3|nt|Gerben42: this could make|pg||
nt|jtr: Will just give up 3 @s tricks now|pg||
nt|athene: @S6 will come in handy|pg||
pc|c5|pc|s2|pg||
nt|athene: ah but they are getting a force going |pg||
nt|Gerben42: my guess is the Norse will get to 3N|pg||
nt|jtr: She wont clear trumps|pg||
nt|athene: maybe a diamond to the queen now and just play some winners|pg||
nt|jtr: Cant afford a @d to the 9 either|pg||
nt|Gerben42: some danger being ruffed from the short side, so maybe @D to Q, then @S to J and then cash winners|pg||
nt|athene: if you are just thinking about long-term prospects in diamonds you lead to the nine first|pg||
nt|athene: but here that's not really an issue|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|pc|hK|pc|h6|pg||
pc|c6|nt|athene: maybe she's going to try eloping with a couple of club ruffs|pg||
pc|c8|pc|s6|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h7|pc|hA|pc|h8|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cT|nt|athene: and hope that south, when he finally ruffs in, will have to lead into the diamonds anyway|pg||
pc|d3|nt|Gerben42: 140 in the other room|pg||
nt|Gerben42: trying a loser on loser here, she doesnt know 98 are all in S|pg||
nt|Gerben42: after all otherwise risking a cheap overruff|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|s4|nt|Gerben42: a deadly defense would be for Helness to ruff partner's trick and let partner ruff a @H|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s5|pc|s3|pg||
nt|jtr: Next door West bailed out in 2 of a major  Would have invited if he found a fit|pg||

nt|psridhar: so first blood to Europe here|pg||
nt|daman: Levin ducked the @D lead|pg||
mb|1D|nt|dimi: is it a board a match event?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|odysseus69: players will be named soon|pg||
nt|jcwla: The website for the competition is  www.buffettcup.com . Please visit the site for Daily Bulletins, Running Scores, the convention cards for the Individual and other information.|pg||
nt|daman: and then lost 2@S tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: thats difficult to comprehend dia duck|pg||
mb|2C|nt|rmb1: Board-a-match throughout|pg||
mb|p|nt|odysseus69: no not a board a match - over 11 boards each pair is competing gainst a specific pair from the other team|pg||
nt|odysseus69: dont know who is playing weak NT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Fantoni-Nunes, I think |pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|jcwla: With all that said, hi Mike.  Looks like a very good result for Europe on Board 1.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you need the 1NT in "sandwich" position to be natural against this EW pair. They open and respond very light. |pg||
nt|daman: weak Smolen|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: Hi Jordan|pg||
nt|mdgraham: On the last board, East may be weak with a long suit. Lebensohl comes in handy (2NT puppets 3@C, then you can bid your long suit). A diretc bid shows reasonable values.|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: Brogeland seq asks for pd to pick a 2 level major nf|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|daman: @C tap right away|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|pc|c2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: So West wasn't flying solo when he bid 3NT.|pg||
nt|psridhar: that attacking lead will tap decl trumps, but decl may not mind scoring his little trumps in a dummy reversal manner|pg||
nt|daman: West has to get the @Ss moving|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cK|nt|odysseus69: looks like 8 tricks i|pg||
nt|jcwla: In the OR, S passed the 1@S opening and EW ended in 3@C.|pg||

nt|psridhar: Brogeland playing dummy reversal indeed|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|nt|rmb1: Do Justin+Jason still play weak NT?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: no- 14-16 rising to 15-17 in 3rd and 4th|pg||

nt|vugraphzrd: Let south claim.|pg||
mb|2C|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|nt|athene: this should win the board for E-W, if it's left in|pg||
nt|athene: 500 against 460 without too much problem|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|jtr: It depends what double means|pg||
nt|athene: i guess in 3nt on a small heart lead you make 490, but probably people won't lead 4th best heart at board a match|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: if double is penalty, west should pass - if it shows a strong balanced hand, it's not so clearcut|pg||
nt|Gerben42: I guess X was "strong NT"|pg||
nt|Gerben42: and east couldnt dbl for T/O with short @S|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|athene: west couldn't|pg||

mb|2C|nt|daman: at trick 2|pg||
nt|psridhar: but EW bid well with E bidding only 1nt on a goodish 18|pg||
mb|2H|nt|mdgraham: possible auction here -  3NT-6@D|pg||
nt|jcwla: In the OR, same start to the auction, but Brogeland did not move over N's 1NT, so a win to USA there.|pg||
mb|p|an|at least 4 pts|nt|daman: goodish is a new word to me|pg||
mb|p|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|odysseus69: sure to make 6D - but can they get there|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North has a huge hand now after the 3@D jump |pg||
nt|odysseus69: and not bid grand|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 3@S likely a fragment-style bid, as South did not bid 1@S over 1@H |pg||
nt|daman: Some pairs play DOPI for controls over opposition to their 2@C opening|pg||
nt|daman: he might get squeezed if he doesn't take his 2@Hs|pg||
nt|daman: but there is the issue of transportation|pg||
nt|daman: and N can hold the @Ss|pg||
nt|psridhar: decl has 10 top tricks and will need to play h to get his 11th|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|rmb1: 3@S is just showing a stop (of sorts) for 3NT,  Does not know North is making slam tries.|pg||
nt|daman: if East had AK10 of @S there would be a shot  |pg||
pc|s4|nt|psridhar: now decl is a tempo behind -likely only 430|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sA|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no 1@S overcall - mildly surprising|pg||

pc|dK|pc|d6|pc|d8|pc|d5|pg||
nt|odysseus69: club lead still not good enough|pg||
nt|rmb1: In a less confident partnership, South would have let North play in hearts by now :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North not content with 6@D at pairs. But a club lead may be interesting  |pg||
nt|odysseus69: sure to make after the take out double|pg||
nt|odysseus69: west will be thrown in to concede 2 spade tricks|pg||
nt|rmb1: I guess there is a strip squeeze on a club lead|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|odysseus69: also could duck and squeeze as long as he reads distribution-not a problem either way |pg||
pc|d7|nt|mdgraham: the t/o double places virtually all the high cards - just room for East to hold @SJ perhaps|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dT|pg||
nt|rmb1: Doesn't duck and squeeze require West to have @SJ, which is only card he might not have|pg||
nt|odysseus69: no - spade jack not relevant|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mdgraham: although West may reduce to a singleton K in spades - but North will get it right  |pg||
nt|rmb1: The plan is for south to have SQx and winning diamond, and North to have SAx and C10.  |pg||
nt|dimi: Nunes has to hold @c K and @s K, so there is no chance to escape the squeeze|pg||
nt|odysseus69: N/S areboth Jill- North Jill Levin -now corrected-wife of Bobby Levin|pg||
pc|h2|nt|rmb1: When South cashes the diamond, either the C10 or SQ will become a winner|pg||
nt|jcwla: I'd say very surprising, meanwhile a great result for Europe here.|pg||

nt|Walddk2: sure you can figure it out|pg||

nt|athene: I don't see how this can make.|pg||
nt|vugraphzrd: the 3h bid is under scrutony.|pg||

pc|s9|nt|jtr: Can you understand South moving over 3NT?|pg||
nt|athene: he'll unblock the spades and lead a heart up, perhaps|pg||
nt|Gerben42: reasonable - 5@C 4@S SEEM certain|pg||
nt|athene: amusingly the clubs would be blocked even with @CJxx but north could throw his 4th club on a major-suit winner|pg||

pc|s4|pc|s3|pg||

pc|d2|pg||
nt|odysseus69: heading for 9 ticks|pg||

nt|odysseus69: I think Fantoni-Nunes lead high from even if with an honour and opposite with no honour|pg||
pc|d9|nt|jcwla: It looks like the auction in the OR got reversed in the movie, but Levin/Weinstein had no trouble bidding to 4@S on 6 so a win for USA there.|pg||
