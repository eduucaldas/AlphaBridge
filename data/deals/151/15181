nt|lestergold:  we are waiting for names but i think n/s are Helgemo Hellness|pg||
nt|lestergold: hi Kit|pg||
nt|kit: hi Mike|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/w Levin Weinstien|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3@D normal contract but needs t outscore a no trump contract always the issue at this form of scoring|pg||
nt|vugraphzrf: Bobby still thinking!!!|pg||
nt|lestergold: looks like declarer can score 130 with the loss of a trick in each side suit trump lead would have been better for the defence|pg||

pc|s8|pc|sA|nt|lestergold: hard to see more than 8 tricks in a no trump contract|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|pg||
mc|10|nt|kit: On trump leads, he could set up the spades nd come to enough tricks I'm pretty sure.|pg||

nt|lestergold: hi Raju|pg||
nt|kit: which is what he did.  In fact, Weinstein had to split to avoid being squeezed for the overtrick|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|mb|2C!|nt|kit: likely inverted raise by Weinstein|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: they may have some artificial way to show a balnced minimum|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lestergold: 3@c seems an odd action|pg||
nt|kit: probably 2NT would be forcing|pg||
nt|lestergold: msu be the explanatikon|pg||
nt|vugraphzrf: 3@c explained as bad/bad|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 3@c guess club to make scoring 110 but 2N ourscores|pg||
nt|kit: assuming the 2@C call shows 5, which I guess it does for them, Levin figured that if Weinstein was passing 3@C that would be best, otherwise would get to 3NT.|pg||
nt|lestergold: but does an inv raise necessarily show 5|pg||
nt|suketbombi: true many pairs wud find themselves in 1/2nt on this hand|pg||
nt|kit: I think 2NT needs the club guess as well.|pg||
nt|lestergold: probably but 120 wins against 110 thats what point abopard is al about|pg||

nt|kit: hi Raju|pg||
nt|vugraphzrf: 12 and 14 cards in Board 2!|pg||
mb|1D|mb|d|mb|r|mb|2H|mb|3H|mb|p|nt|lestergold: looking ahead 6@d makes because the takeout double has provided a road map to the winning play in spades|pg||
nt|lestergold: the takeout double a little lighht but very shape suitable|pg||
nt|kit: this sort of Q-bid generally asks partner to bid 3NT with a stopper in their suit.|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 6@D is an excellent spot trust helgamo wud be there after Double @Ss can be picked up for sure|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|kit: Helness has that, but he is wondering if he has enough for slam|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|nt|kit: Helgemo is minimal for his 3@H call, so he just signs off.  Now Helness has to guess.|pg||
nt|lestergold: needs to bid slam now to outscore no trumps so often the case at mps|pg||
nt|kit: He knows Helgemo has solid diamonds, and those black tens might be fat (and one of them is)|pg||
nt|suketbombi: even 6nt squeeze without count can be executed on a @C lead|pg||
mb|5N|mb|p|nt|kit: or can just duck the club and then a normal squeeze|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes true|pg||
nt|lestergold: i like the comparison of the tens with me not heard that before|pg||
nt|lestergold: is Helgemo thinking of 6N?|pg||
nt|kit: he sure is|pg||
nt|kit: but with the singleton club I think he should pick diamonds -- you never know when a ruff might come in handy.|pg||
nt|lestergold: well luckily levin on lead unlikely to find club if he does|pg||
mb|6N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|kit: I think Levin might well find the club lead.  Opponents clearly prepared for hearts if they bid 6NT|pg||
nt|lestergold: at this form of scoring players have to judge whetehr slam is easy to reach and with heavy values as no trumps outscores difficult decision here|pg||
nt|lestergold: if levin is inspired?|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hJ|pc|hQ|nt|lestergold: ait is scored point a board|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d8|pc|dA|pc|d6|pg||
nt|kit: Declarer probably should duck a club and play for the squeeze -- more likely to work than jack of spades onside|pg||
pc|dK|nt|lestergold: which i think makes it equivalent to mp tactics as opposed to butler which is not being used|pg||
pc|c2|nt|kit: or he can just play spade to 10, giving himself both chances -- looks best of all.|pg||
pc|d2|pc|h2|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sJ|pc|sA|mc|12|nt|lestergold: the point is that he will make whatever and score well for bidding nop trumps|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 6@D a far superior contract wud make even if @SJ the only material card here is doubleton with Levin but this format has forced helgamo to go for maximum here|pg||
pg||
qx|o4|st||md|2SK862HJ9832D84CKQ,ST973HT5DAT953C72,S5HAK76DQJ72C9643,SAQJ4HQ4DK6CAJT85|sv|b|nt|vugraphzrf: Levin asked if he washed his hands!!!!!|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|suketbombi: :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: part score major battle|pg||
mb|d|nt|kit: I wonder what this double shows?|pg||
nt|lestergold: players strain not to dfefend 1n at this form of scoring|pg||
nt|vugraphzrf: major and minor|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Now let's see if Levin starts bidding his 2-suiter|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|kit: so 2@H is probably pass or correct?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|3H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cK|pc|c2|nt|lestergold: typical needle double at this form of scoring|pg||

pc|h9|pc|h5|pc|hK|pc|h4|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hQ|nt|lestergold: not sure tho why Helgemo believed that this was n/s hand that is usually the reason for doubling|pg||

nt|lestergold: well round zero i would think for the great Norwegian legends|pg||
nt|lestergold: Helgemo has had two bad boards in a row entirely of his own making|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1D|mb|1S|mb|2D|mb|2S!|nt|lestergold: 5@d a good save against 4@s|pg||
mb|3C|mb|3H|nt|suketbombi: a save in 5@D wud be the par on this Hand even tho at worst loose a@S 2@Hs and a @C|pg||
mb|4C|nt|kit: They will surely compete to 5@D after Levin's 3@C bid hits king-fifth in partner's hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: some specs think last hand was just unlucky and that  Helgemo's line was as reasonable as any waht do u guys think?|pg||
mb|d|mb|4D|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|suketbombi: this wud enable East to save but his @Hs valuse may lure him not to|pg||
nt|kit: I din't like his line|pg||
nt|lestergold: nor did I but i agree it was a complex hand with a lot of options|pg||
mb|5D|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|c2|nt|lestergold: it is insructive as to just how much difference is made by point a board scoring|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cT|pc|cA|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dT|pc|d5|nt|kit: it can be very difficult, since you don't always know what your objective is|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|dK|pc|sT|pc|d8|pc|d7|pg||
pc|c5|nt|lestergold: sacrifices are more likely for sure especially at these colours when you can make a profit with 3 down|pg||
pc|h4|pc|c3|pc|c7|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d3|nt|kit: Levin can expect that the club lead is a singleton, so he knows the shape of the hand now.|pg||
pc|s2|pc|dA|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|pc|h5|nt|lestergold: risk versus reward ratios change completely|pg||

qx|o6|st||md|4S865HAK85DT53CAJ2,SQ97HJT7DK986CK53,SKJT32H64DAQ72CQT,SA4HQ932DJ4C98764|sv|e|nt|vugraphzrf: Anothre 12 and 14 hand!|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: I agree Mike -- he didn't figure to make 3@H.  He should just be happy he got the opponents to the 3-level.|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|kit: Let's see if Helness probes for a spade fit or just blasts to 3NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|d6|pc|d2|nt|kit: Very difficult lead problem for Weinstein IMO -- diamond lead doesn't figure to set up much, and may blow a trick|pg||
nt|lestergold: needs to make 10 tricks here to outscore spades|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d5|pg||
nt|suketbombi: well helgamo is at par withe @S contract here having escaped the unlikely @H lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: look slike he will make 10 and i dont think spades can do more than make on the nose|pg||
nt|kit: is it so clear that there are 10 tricks in spades?|pg||
nt|lestergold: club dim and spade to lose?|pg||
nt|kit: right, sorry -- miscounted|pg||
pc|d4|nt|kit: so key now is for Levin to shift to a heart|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d8|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|kit: Now it looks like declarer can attack clubs first and get to 10 tricks on the lucky lie of the cards, but he doesn't know that|pg||
nt|suketbombi: wud he now get the danger hand out by hooking @Cs Before @Ss|pg||
nt|kit: From his point of view, if the club finesse loses a diamond continuation will knock out the entry to the spades -- he doesn't know East has ace-doubleton.|pg||
pc|sK|nt|lestergold: if he plays club abd west ducks smoothly he has a real problem |pg||
nt|kit: He might pass 10 of clubs, so queen of clubs remains as entry|pg||
nt|kit: This wasn't so good for declarer -- now I think he comes up a trick short for the contract.|pg||
nt|lestergold: problem playuing club is if weisntein ducks he then has option torfepat amd the weisntrin  wins clears clubs and contract defeated|pg||
nt|lestergold: this may be why Helgemo has given up on chance for 4 wpade tricks|pg||
nt|kit: It would be pretty difficult for Weinstein to duck|pg||
nt|lestergold: i agree but at this form of scoring players usually repeat as they need to garner every trick|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pc|s7|pg||
nt|kit: Levin can probably work out his partner has queen of spades, else why did it take declarer so long to attack spades.|pg||
nt|lestergold: however cannot really understand Helgemo's play|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hA|nt|lestergold: ht switch inevitable|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h4|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sQ|pc|s2|pc|s4|pg||
nt|kit: now he will have to take club finesse anyway|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dA|nt|lestergold: hts set up before club has been tackled doesnt seem best card play helgemo has ever produced|pg||
pc|c4|pc|dT|pg||
nt|kit: Weinstein can now defeat contract with either king of diamonds or heart play|pg||
nt|lestergold: or dim same difference|pg||
nt|kit: if he decides club finesse is off, he can survive with heart to ace, run spades, throw West in (or drop club if West stiffs king).  But that is a big play.|pg||
nt|suketbombi: helgemo can cash the @H and  there a squeeze on weinstein|pg||
nt|kit: He might try it just try to get even from what he now knows wasn't a successful line of play.|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c7|pc|c2|pc|cK|pg||
mc|8|nt|lestergold: no this legebdary card player has taken all the wrong decsiisons on this hand|pg||
nt|suketbombi: weinstein wud have done well by ducking the @S and then reurning the @D K|pg||
pg||

nt|lestergold: iis this a weak no trump or an upgraded strong one?|pg||
nt|kit: I'm pretty sure they play strong notrumps|pg||
nt|suketbombi: Levin and Weinstein having a great set here except for the board no2 where Helgemo bid and made 6NT|pg||
