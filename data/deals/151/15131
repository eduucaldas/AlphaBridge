pc|d4|pc|sK|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Saada can't know but there is a good chance they are good values if East is able to show a singleton diamond|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Many partnerships can|pg||
mc|12|nt|jtr: Indeed|pg||
nt|jtr: Quite why 4@h was necessary i really do not know|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Unless it shows a single diamond, but I don't think so|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3 boards to go before a break|pg||
nt|ady: I prefer showing shortage after 2NT   but many prefer showing a 2nd suit   but usually at the 3 level  and 4 level with at least 5?|pg||
nt|jtr: Maybe 2NT was just limit+ here though|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5@H would be 5-5 for me with a strong side suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I bid 3@D to show a singleton|pg||
nt|ady: do you mean 4@H?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, 4@H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Or you can agree to play 3@C as minimum, then 3@D as a relay to ask for shortage. However, this East hand is not a minimum and then you can bid your shortage immediately to show ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: shortage|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That is also a good method|pg||
nt|jtr: Yes, that allows 2nT to be a raise to 3+|pg||
