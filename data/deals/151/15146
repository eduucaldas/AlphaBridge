nt|jbgood: well put David, a less than perfect defense may even allow 3 spades to make|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm a nice freak|pg||
nt|roswolf: practical bidding in the other room|pg||
nt|vugraphzqn: they|pg||
mb|1D|mb|1S|nt|vugraphpl2: witamy kibicow|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w were slightly unlucky in the other room|pg||
nt|rv: I agree, if it at all it means something logical, it should be the expn of t/o of @s with max pre-empt (close to opening hand)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jbgood: may be duplicated|pg||
nt|tomi2: I dont like the double of 3@D, for me it does not show Kjxx, its just for the lead, think one should bid something to committ the partnership to 4th level to show the willing to ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: play 4@H or 5@D|pg||
nt|henryb:  reaching 6@h is well done|pg||
mb|3S|an|pree|nt|marlowepi: in other words, it means "i should have opened 1H"|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no diamond raise form South|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: other major + longer minor?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|roswolf: same start as the other room|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: yes 7@H would however be very unlucky|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: the @C10 might have been a good shot for the defence|pg||
nt|roswolf: even so dont particulary like dbl|pg||
nt|rv: Raptor is not very popular, Sandwitch nt to show other 2 suits after (1x)-(1y) is more popular|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: so East should buy 4@s |pg||
nt|peachy: if it was a Precision 1D, I'm not surprised|pg||
pc|h4|nt|mdgraham: you might bid 2@D anyway, as with two spades the opposition are likely to be raising  |pg||
pc|h2|pc|hQ|nt|roswolf: except north bid 3@S rather than 4@C|pg||
nt|brolucius: Not unreasonable for North to bid strongly on his hand, which has potential. 3@S by North at the other table was a bit on the cautious side.|pg||
nt|vugraphzqn: he missbid 3 @c|pg||
nt|vugraphzqn: then he bid 4@c|pg||
nt|roswolf: AAHHH|pg||
nt|rv: I prefer 1n O/C to show 15-18 though I like Sandwitch NT |pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|roswolf: 2nt = enquiry for minor!?|pg||
pc|h6|nt|roswolf: this is tight but can/should go -1|pg||
nt|jbgood: .. and if you want to play 4 @s, you dont give away your hand by bidding 4 @c?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: matchpoint methods, IMHBAICO. i would never give up strong NT overcall at IMPs. variety of approaches is certainly interesting though|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h3|pg||
pc|d4|nt|tihana: hi all|pg||
nt|mdgraham: amusing that East can't ruff a diamond in dummy |pg||
nt|athene: hi good evening|pg||
nt|tihana: from pula live :)|pg||
pc|d8|nt|athene: he plays this way to force the defence to give him a black-suit finesse|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d9|pg||
nt|roswolf: very interesting and i agree raptor is a pairs gadget|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|tomi2: yes! this works well when partner has the ace, if not op will often nottake a finesse if he has some other play available|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cK|pc|c7|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c8|nt|peachy: Hi and thanks for joing here, a little local color never hurts!!!!!|pg||
nt|athene: you can often use elimination-type positions to this end|pg||
nt|tihana: we strongly support she - who goes to bad at 8 :)|pg||
pc|s9|pc|c5|pg||
nt|mdgraham: don't mind where she goes, as long as she's bad :) |pg||
nt|athene: good girls go to heaven - bad girls go everywhere|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|c6|nt|mdgraham: bad girls got to Essex |pg||
pc|dK|pc|s2|pg||
pc|s5|nt|brolucius: The defenders have made no mistake and declarer will have to look long and hard to find anywhere to ditch one of his two diamond losers. I wish him good luck.|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s3|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|marlowepi: so they play that a double of 1S is penalty? even playing gadgets i dont see any call but double on the S gand|pg||
mc|10|nt|roswolf: or a revoke|pg||
nt|roswolf: a push|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hand, not gand (or gland)|pg||
nt|tihana: :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but we won't have any Essex Girl jokes here, thanks all the same|pg||

mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d4|nt|xenya: The other team, i'm told, is international: Croatia, England and France -- all players are under 29 |pg||
nt|sfoxa: N could hardly be blamed for her bid - partner supported @d, so Lara sees no way to beat 4@s |pg||
nt|sfoxa: altough, it woukd be costly, unfortunately|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d6|pc|d5|pg||

nt|tomi2: this auction will not be duplicated here. Polish pairs play 1@D as negative over (1@C)-x-(p)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.pzbs.pl/wyniki/turnieje/2010/pula/team/pulateamleaderb.html  for running scores|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is a nasty hand for n/s|pg||
nt|rv: yes agree Marshall even playing raptor, X seems a good option|pg||
nt|athene: a good slam here|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: this looks a reasonable slam|pg||
mb|1S|nt|athene: 6@S needs 3-2 spades and no club ruff most of the time|pg||
mb|3D|nt|tomi2: ok over 1@D this does not work|pg||
mb|3S|nt|roswolf: north mustnt get too carried away with his points|pg||
nt|brolucius: Krakow is a beautiful mediaeval city, where the restaurants serve a lot of game dishes, such as venison. A great place for a week's holiday.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: NS obviously not Precision, so it looks like 1@D was natural on the previous hand|pg||
mb|4D|nt|peachy: same auction so far as in Closed Room|pg||
nt|mdgraham: good barrage|pg||
nt|tihana: S doesnt need much from p|pg||
nt|athene: south might just wheel out blackwood now, trusting his partner to have little wastage in diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: i think that is the practical decision|pg||
mb|4S|nt|tomi2: do you bid 1@S or 1@H with north hand? and why?|pg||
nt|rv: 1@c is 3 way here|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: nor must west!!!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good evening to Peter Gill|pg||
nt|roswolf: what was 1nt supposed to be?|pg||
nt|petergill: Hi|pg||
nt|athene: wow|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: to me 3D is hasty -- you might have a heart game. with this shape and nobody bidding spades, it is unlikely opps can outbid you, so go slow. if they bid more clubs, diamonds still ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: rank higher|pg||
nt|tihana: hihi|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|athene: certainly you have to give partner a bit of slack since 3@S was bid under pressure and hence it's a "good 2@S bid up to a mediocre 3@S bid" - with a good 3@S bid north should just ...|pg||
nt|athene: bid game - but even so|pg||
nt|tihana: South should go to bed at 8 :) |pg||
pc|dA|nt|jbgood: north is wondering who has the spades . if prd has them, he must be very weak|pg||
nt|henryb:  More to the point, do you make a takeout double of 1@d with South or remain a churchmouse, silent and waiting|pg||
nt|roswolf: i bid 1@H "UP THE LINE"|pg||
pc|d6|nt|roswolf: fair comment|pg||
nt|rv: I would have bid 2@h on 1@d O/C to show @hs and @ds, fit showing jump|pg||
nt|rv: instead of 3@d by East|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes for me 3@D would show a worthless hand |pg||
pc|d2|pg||
pc|s3|nt|roswolf: this should be a cakewalk|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sA|nt|roswolf: heart suit quality not good enough for me for a fit jump|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|sK|nt|tomi2: dont understand easts pass here. ater not selling out to 1@S and a raise by partner Game should be a good shot|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s5|pc|s7|pg||
pc|s4|nt|peachy: In the other room, it was South who bid 4D, thast could have excited North at least a little|pg||
mc|12|nt|athene: you don't like it when you get pre-empted out of a slam, but you like it less when you get pre-empting into a slam which doesn't make|pg||
pg||
qx|c2|st||md|4SAKQ84HAQ4D2CKJT8,SJ2H52DKJT875CA62,ST53HKT987DA4CQ75,S976HJ63DQ963C943|sv|n|nt|sfoxa: 2 imps loss, it seems|pg||
mb|p|nt|sfoxa: hm, I wonder, how NS recover to bid vulnerable small slam here|pg||
mb|1S|mb|3D|nt|xenya: yes, 6 in either major for NS|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|othered1: Rehi, everyone|pg||
nt|sfoxa: hello Ed|pg||
mb|4D|nt|othered1: Would you act with the east hand over 3@S, with that fit? (ignore the shape)|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|xenya: not a bad slam really as it is possible to overcome some 4-1 splits thanks to those 10's|pg||
nt|sfoxa: I do prefer to pass with such a long but weak fit|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|dJ|nt|othered1: I agree.  3@S doesn't put them in slam and I wouldn't want to precipitate a winning stab by NS|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d3|pc|d2|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s6|pc|sA|pc|s2|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sJ|pc|sT|pc|s7|pg||
mc|12|nt|othered1: As often happens, the minimally preemptive 3@D was enough to nudge NS offtrack|pg||
nt|sfoxa: But I'd prefer 4@c bid with S hand, not 4@d |pg||
pg||
qx|o3|st||md|1S7HJ8653DAKJ653C3,SJT3HK9742D97CQ98,SAK9854HADQTCAT65,SQ62HQTD842CKJ742|sv|e|nt|roswolf: well an easy slam now|pg||
nt|rv: can't have everything/be too specific Geoff, at 2 level being passed hand and values in 2 suits, I like fit jump a lot|pg||
nt|roswolf: its mainly a matter of philosophy|pg||
nt|tihana: well in the other room North is SHE, so at least she's aware of it|pg||
mb|1D|nt|roswolf: can they gei to the grand|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphpl2: dyskusja o poprzednim rozdaniu|pg||
nt|athene: 7@D here, if you want it enough|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|jbgood: grands are rarely "easy" ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I like one of the team names in Group U, "She goes to bed at 8"   :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: normally i agree totally Jeff. i think there is a case, though, for loosening the suit-strength criteria when you are a passed hand. i could go either way on that|pg||
nt|athene: but no-one ever raises minors with five-card support these days so i doubt north will ever own up to a mere Q10 doubleton|pg||
mb|2H|nt|petergill: Filipowicz and Martens won Australia's biggest bridge event earlier this year, and I'm told that they also won the Polish Pairs Championship last year. |pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.pzbs.pl/wyniki/turnieje/2010/pula/team/pulateamleaderb.html  for running scores|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: nice slam to get to|pg||
mb|2S|an|!|mb|p|nt|roswolf: 3@C = MAYBE BOTH MAJORS? OR CONTROLS|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Geoff|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: now N is worried that 4C wont be read as forcing|pg||
nt|rv: now North worth 4@c to show fit and extras (I like to play crossing 3n with minor fit shows extras)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: so he may bid 3S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: planning to bid 4C over 3N to reveal intentions|pg||
nt|athene: ok|pg||
nt|peachy: South prob should rebid diamonds, even with shape, he really does not have enough for reverse|pg||
nt|athene: he might have visions of 7@D now, the way the bidding has gone|pg||
nt|athene: north might|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@H would classically be a "reverse" - showing a much stronger hand|pg||
nt|athene: he can pretty much play the hand through in his head|pg||
nt|athene: win the heart or club lead, ruff spades good, draw trumps, get back with the other ace|pg||
nt|athene: Michael Rosenberg has said that when you are in a slam auction you should be trying to play the hand in the bidding|pg||
mb|7D|nt|athene: often you can see problems - for example if north didn't have BOTH side aces, declarer might be short of an entry for reaching the good spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: wasnt 2@D setting up a gf|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: seemy both tables will sell the W hand as strong balanced. I think one could open 1@D|pg||
nt|tomi2: both black suits are stopped but the stops dont run away|pg||
mb|p|nt|tihana: wow|pg||
nt|peachy: wow, North trusted South to actyually have the reverse values|pg||
nt|athene: ok - i apologise for doubting him - he DID show Q10 doubleton!|pg||
nt|athene: well you can't bid much less than 7 after partner reversed|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well done North - influenced by South's reverse, perhaps|pg||
nt|athene: i would have thought it was an underbid if anything|pg||
nt|peachy: exactly, sometimes unconventional bidding pays|pg||
nt|tihana: very different approaches from Grosset and Dombi|pg||
nt|athene: he will probably expect his partner to have that hand but with the @HKQ too so even if the spades can't be used, there will be enough tricks anyway, perhaps with a heart ruff|pg||
nt|peachy: In the other room S did not open, that decision is unusual as well|pg||
nt|athene: yes the diamonds got sort of lost in the other room|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mdgraham: well, if you can make a slam in a suit, someone has to bid the suit at some stage|pg||
nt|peachy: His only line is to develop the spades, so he'll just do that and hope|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you won't bid 7@D if all you bid is spades, clubs, and no-trumps |pg||
nt|athene: http://www.pzbs.pl/wyniki/turnieje/2010/pula/team/pulateamleaderb.html  for running scores|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can make with 4-2 spades - he doesn't need 3-3|pg||
nt|mdgraham: in the other room South resonded 1NT to 1@S. As a passed hand, there doesn't seem much wrong with 2@D  |pg||
nt|athene: but if the spades need two ruffs declarer has only three discards and he needs a heart ruff too|pg||
nt|athene: declarer, understandably, is taking his time|pg||
nt|tihana: a mach with two grands already bid.|pg||
nt|athene: you are a bit worried about spade over-ruffs from west|pg||
nt|athene: if you start ruffing spades high you might find you lose a trump trick if they break 4-1|pg||
nt|tihana: @S3 would be nice lead :)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|petergill: Consus is EW's sponsor - a major company in Poland - Consus is involved in emissions trading schemes or something like that|pg||
nt|rv: if North had min he could have passed 3@c even if 2@d was not setting GF, in my book 4@c should be forcing|pg||
nt|roswolf: or not as the case may be|pg||
pc|s2|nt|marlowepi: N apparently worried that 3rd suit forcing does not set up a GF, or else that his pd wont be sure it does, or else that "GF" auctions can still die at 4m|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3NT IS VERY FORTUNATE|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sQ|nt|roswolf: strong with 5 spades apparently|pg||
pc|d3|nt|roswolf: fell short - indeed not as easy as it seems|pg||
nt|petergill: 4NT RKCB should in my opinion be followed by 5NT by South, to let North know that NS has all the keycards and trump queen|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|athene: spade ruff low, @HA, then have a think :)|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps it would have been better to cash the @HA first actually? if you are planning on two spade ruffs and one heart ruff|pg||
nt|athene: you don't ever want to have to overtake a diamond honour from dummy|pg||
nt|athene: or you really are squandering too many big diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: never a wise plan in today's financial climate|pg||
pc|h3|nt|athene: so maybe @SA, @HA, spade ruff, heart ruff, cash diamond from dummy, spade ruff was better|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hA|pc|hT|pg||
nt|roswolf: 12 top tricks|pg||
pc|s5|nt|Walddk2: It's on a finesse, not that fortunate|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Must finesse spades to make it|pg||
nt|henryb:  needs the @s finesse. and a little luck in a pointed suit: either 3-3 @s or @d coming home|pg||
nt|jbgood: cllose your eyes and open them again after the spade jack wins:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: but lots off if finesse is wrong|pg||
nt|tomi2: in 5@D you lose two aces but can survive without finesses|pg||
pc|s6|nt|brolucius: South had the option, presumably, of bidding 5NT after his 4NT. This would tell partner that all the key cards were held and invite him to bid a grand slam. |pg||
nt|peachy: now has to ruff a heart and hope diamonds split|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this line will need 3-2 trumps, as South can't get back to hand after a heart ruff without overtaking, and if he takes a club ruff he can't get back to dummy|pg||
nt|athene: yes, exactly|pg||
nt|athene: i think cashing the @HA at trick 2 was definitely an improvement on this line|pg||
pc|d6|nt|petergill: Then North might bid the grand. |pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|athene: he has no options now does he? he can't ever ruff high here|pg||
pc|h5|nt|roswolf: whereas 5@D is gin|pg||
pc|h4|nt|rv: slam auctions become too diff, if both North and South both want to have Inv bids after South has shown min |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|marlowepi: and over 3N, N was worried that if he bid on terorists would kill his children. only explanation i can think of for not bidding 4C over 3N|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|dT|nt|henryb:  Obviously both 4@h, 4@s and 5@d are all better contracts|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dA|pc|d7|pg||
nt|jbgood: i guess they will bid it -- in the post mortem|pg||
nt|vugraphzqn: small argue befor playing that last one...system problems I think...|pg||
pc|dK|mc|13|pg||
qx|c3|st||md|1S7HJ8653DAKJ653C3,SJT3HK9742D97CQ98,SAK9854HADQTCAT65,SQ62HQTD842CKJ742|sv|e|nt|othered1: I agree with 4@C, to let partner focus on that suit.|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: and another one...|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|sfoxa: sometimes, partner bids 3@s with  worser hand that this one was|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|sfoxa: so, each partner's value is on gold cost. and after 4@d having no @c cue, partner closes bidding properly, as it happened |pg||
nt|othered1: I wonder if south can't bid 3@D for a systemic reason|pg||
nt|xenya: now if S can persuade partner he has such good diamonds, N might even go for grand|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|othered1: Like 3@C showing a multitude of possible hands and 3@D asking for more definition|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|othered1: @C lead, not easy to find, is best|pg||
nt|xenya: now S might fear that 5@D would be taken as cuebid?|pg||
pc|d8|nt|sfoxa: assumingly, NS is a fresh partnership, we can exercise in commenting their bidding quite long |pg||
nt|othered1: After the 3N bid, I don't know what it could show unless they need a way to plug a hole in the system|pg||
nt|xenya: anyway 5@D looks like a poor bid here|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d7|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|sfoxa: anyway, I'm not a fan of the agreements that prevent me from showing 6-cards suit lower than game level|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|pc|s7|pc|s3|pg||
pc|sK|pc|s2|pc|h3|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sQ|pc|h5|nt|othered1: Nor I.  Failing to get y our long suits into the auction is a minus whether your system prevents it or just a misjudgment.|pg||
nt|sfoxa: declarer will be happy to find @s broken 3-3|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|xenya: we can see that declarer can make 12 tricks by simply playing trumps -- but that is not a safe line i think|pg||
mc|12|nt|sfoxa: with 4-2 split, second @d lead makes dummy dead |pg||
nt|othered1: If you think the @D was a stiff, what can be right save pulling trumps at once?|pg||
pg||
qx|o4|st||md|2SAQ62H872DJ82CK83,S95H53DAKQTCQJ976,ST74HAKJT9D9764CT,SKJ83HQ64D53CA542|sv|b|nt|petergill: West's Dbl of 2@D indicated to NS that @DK was offside and might have contributed to NS's pessimism|pg||
nt|brolucius: South did make a grand slam try at the other table and North accepted. Well bid!|pg||
nt|tomi2: west saw akqxx @D when he opened the bidding|pg||
nt|henryb:  because we are good birds with a birds-eye view|pg||
nt|athene: well i am happy to see people gaining imps for bidding minor suits :) i think they are neglected these days|pg||
mb|1C|an|!|mb|1H|nt|roswolf: the other room had no problem - a bow and arrow approach 3-5-6|pg||
mb|d|an|4!S|nt|athene: 2@C from south i guess|pg||
nt|athene: but of course north won't be interested in anything higher than 2@H|pg||
mb|2C|an|!|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 2@C=good raise to 2@H|pg||
mb|2H|nt|marlowepi: it is not a question of "cancelling" a GF. there is a case for allowing "strong" auctions to die at 4m, because not every hand that wants to play 3N if a certain suit is stopped ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: would be thriolled to contract for 11 tricks if it isnt|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so (usually) 2@H is the weakest bid North can make|pg||
nt|athene: east has a lot to say - he has a 1nt bid, a negative double and a club raise|pg||
nt|peachy: I like Dbl|pg||
nt|athene: but clubs are raised even less often than diamonds these days of course|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|petergill: East is one of the world's greatest players. His website is http://www.martensuniversity.com/. |pg||
nt|brolucius: North's 2@H means that he want to go no higher (understandably) if South's major is hearts.|pg||
mb|p|nt|rv: it essentially means you are cancelling GF:)|pg||
mb|p|pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h8|nt|petergill: Martens' books and training are highly recommended - some of his books have been translated into English|pg||
nt|brolucius: South doubles 3@H to tell partner that this is his suit. If he omitted to do this, North might on some auctions bid high in spades, assuming that South held spades.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: a question of wording i guess. you could call it a "conditional game force" too|pg||
nt|roswolf: west probably converted a plus into a minus by bidding 4@H|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|peachy: difficult to pass 2H, their last chance for a plus|pg||
pc|s4|nt|athene: 2@H would be interesting but i guess it might go one down|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pc|s5|pg||
nt|brolucius: It seems to me that East's 3@H was a bit risky, since it might have been read as natural (with South's suit not yet known). But West held hearts and did not raise so they clearly ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: knew what they were doing.|pg||
nt|petergill: At least 1100 looks achievable if East can double 2@H for take-out and West converts to penalty|pg||
nt|jbgood: perhaps it would have paid off to double 2 hearts? |pg||
nt|jbgood: unlucky lead|pg||
nt|athene: would be touch and go between one down and making|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dA|pc|d7|pc|d3|pg||
nt|brolucius: Perhaps that would have shown hearts?|pg||
nt|petergill: At both tables, the vulnerable penalty was not taken|pg||
nt|peachy: this was not an easy hand for East|pg||
nt|athene: it doesn't help to cash the diamonds throwing the hearts away - south can ruff and still make a trump trick|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: hmmm - i was expecting south to say he had a minimum, which isn't usually 3nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|petergill: Heading for a flat board here|pg||

nt|brolucius: The second big swing to Consus was on the 4@H hand that was apparently misplayed by declarer here too, but let through by North.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer was allowed to go down at the other table.|pg||
nt|vugraphzqn: see you in 15 minutes...thx all...|pg||
nt|petergill: Interesting to see how the swing to Consus on Bd 7 arose - in 4@H Martens seemed to keep more options open in the play and gained a major swing when trumps broke 4-1|pg||
nt|petergill: Not at all easy to know how to play that 4@h on Bd 7|pg||

pc|c9|pc|c7|nt|marlowepi: my point being, the only possible reason for 2C is that E may be worried about clubs going bad, and also W doubled 1C. but the fact that S ran gives E a 3C bid|pg||

nt|roswolf: here definitely strong!|pg||

nt|roswolf: agreed rv|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|brolucius: West decides he is not worth anything stronger than 4@H (such as 4@C, splinter) because East limited his hand with the 1@D response.|pg||
pc|s9|nt|roswolf: and a diamond switch!?|pg||

pc|s7|pc|sA|nt|xenya: N must have been thinking whether to probe for slam after 4@H from S, so he felt insulted when he saw the double|pg||

nt|roswolf: did someone pull out a plug?rehi all|pg||
nt|roswolf: this might get feisty|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: suits aren splitting friendly in this hand|pg||
nt|athene: most people would open the north hand 1@S - 2@S is ok if that's what it shows|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|vugraphzqn: ...sry all..lost conection..:(|pg||
nt|roswolf: aggressive opening by north|pg||
nt|peachy: in light opening style, North will open|pg||
mb|1N|an|!|mb|p|mb|2C|nt|henryb:  Must not have weak 2 available|pg||
nt|rv: 3rd seat pre-empt can be wide ranging for most partnerships|pg||
nt|athene: a very surprising pass from east - i would have thought it was simply a choice between double and 2@H (i woudl double)|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: South does not double because 1@C is artificial.|pg||
nt|roswolf: a weak 2 is very strong by today's standards|pg||
nt|marlowepi: double?|pg||
mb|2N|nt|mdgraham: very disciplined pass over 1@s by East|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: dont like the 1nt - i would double having both majors|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2NT may show good clubs |pg||
mb|3C|nt|vugraphpl2: ale klotni nie ma atmosfera dalej ok|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: i think a polish 1@C should be assumed to be natural-ish and defend accordingly|pg||
nt|athene: there's such a fine line between "disciplined" and "wet" :)|pg||
nt|athene: 2nt is just natural by the look of it|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes. You might not like 2@H, but double is possible|pg||
nt|peachy: If playing sound overcalls, E suit is not good enough.  Opposite passed partner, I think it is just conservative, not quite "wet"|pg||
nt|athene: south might just bid 3nt now anyway|pg||
nt|athene: those tens and nines are all quite nice|pg||
nt|mdgraham: wouldn't mind double|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|roswolf: dont understand east's pass over 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Yes.|pg||
nt|rv: not sure if X meant anything specific, possibly East felt he had unstated strength|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: West's choices for opening lead, difficult|pg||
nt|athene: no way to beat this - declarer will just plot away at the clubs|pg||
nt|athene: *plod away|pg||
pc|s4|nt|tomi2: dont know what systems they use, but Martnes is fan of a system with very weak openings w/r and strong club while vulnerable he prefers to play natural openings|pg||
nt|athene: with @HAK @CAK off the hand declarer knows he needs a certain amount of good fortune, but it's all forthcoming|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|nt|vugraphpl2: gosia miala obawy ze singlowa wziela|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c7|nt|brolucius: North-South have sold out too cheaply, really. They have half the points and a 4-4 spade fit.|pg||
nt|jbgood: a steal for sure|pg||
nt|rv: not best defense|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c8|pg||
nt|athene: if the defence had attacked hearts right from the start they would be threatening to set up east's long heart before declarer got the clubs going, but south could change plans and ...|pg||
nt|athene: go for the diamonds and spades - with both finesses working he would have nine tricks without any clubs|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|d6|nt|tomi2: this hand seems to be the reason.|pg||

pc|h3|pc|hQ|pc|hK|nt|vugraphpl2: gajcyk wypytuje o sekwencje zrzutek|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|rv: East's X should have possibly enabled West to defend hand more accurately, he knew partner has most of unseen values|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i guess it was a pealty double of 3H. unlucky they ran|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 10@H right, @dK right |pg||
nt|athene: and the @SQ|pg||
pc|s6|nt|peachy: everything right :)|pg||
nt|athene: finessing looks like the best play here|pg||
nt|peachy: while he is  thinking:   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Istria.png  Pula is located by the beautiful Adriatic Sea|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this is the sort of hand the opposition always make aganst you - off course you go about two off|pg||
nt|athene: there are some layouts where it would be wrong but nothing like as many|pg||
pc|sK|nt|roswolf: yes that is why double was better - the flexible friend|pg||
pc|s9|nt|jbgood: they would have to fight over 3 clubs then - not easy|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|athene: ok, perhaps declarer decided that west would not lead from @SQxxx - so he either has five, or he doesn't have the queen|pg||
pc|c5|nt|athene: if he has @SQxxxx and no entry you are safe to rise @SA|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|henryb:  Since E-W make 3@c and can beat 3@s, what's the signicant difference?|pg||
nt|roswolf: DID this really happen?|pg||
nt|rv: East's X ideally should be t/o of @s with max of pre-empt, doesn't make sense to show "I have good and lots of @hs"|pg||
pc|h2|nt|jbgood: and only one down ...|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmmmmmmmmm|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|athene: there was another consideration - he might think that west wouldn't give him a working spade finesse he couldn't take for himself|pg||
pc|c2|pc|s7|nt|roswolf: not a lot in truth at imps|pg||
pc|c9|pc|d4|pg||

nt|brolucius: A lot of difference in the long run, if you do not compete strongly enough. May not matter on this particular deal.|pg||

nt|xenya: last board now|pg||
nt|xenya: http://www.pzbs.pl/wyniki/turnieje/2010/pula/team/pulateam2leaderb.html  -- for the tournament site |pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Opening the north hand could lead to some rebid problems|pg||
mb|2S|nt|othered1: But it does get the boss suit in early|pg||
mb|3H|nt|othered1: Was t hat a weak 2 or a 2-suited bid?|pg||
nt|sfoxa: not this opening|pg||
nt|othered1: 3@H says east came to b id|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|sfoxa: I woud prefer pass with N hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: hard to tell these days, Ed|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|othered1: south's turn to double, likely with more success than west's last effort|pg||
nt|othered1: I pass north's hand, also, but I'm a registered chicken.|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|othered1: That may cost a @D trick, as cards lie and if NS could get defense right early.|pg||
nt|sfoxa: next question - E shouldn't play trumps|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c6|pc|cA|pg||
nt|othered1: 4-0 trump break is likely on this auction|pg||
