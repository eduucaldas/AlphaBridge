nt|roswolf: hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Your commentators are P Sridhar, India, Robin Barker and Geoffrey Wolfarth, England. I am Roland Wald from England/Denmark|pg||
nt|psridhar: hi all good morning|pg||
nt|rmb1: Hi |pg||

nt|garnetts: Must admit I cannot see much wrong with 1@H and if I had managed to bid 2@H --then 3@D wouldn't have been on my mind |pg||
nt|yo_yo: 2@H would be a 6 card suit with me|pg||
nt|blum1956: hi all|pg||
nt|ady: hi|pg||
nt|garnetts: In the balancing position here 2@H should be say a decent six card suit and a reasonable hand --what used to be called intermediate |pg||

pc|h9|nt|Walddk2: This line is scary. It's not a good idea to shorten the long hand when you also have fit in a side suit|pg||
nt|garnetts: West should hold his cards up lol  |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nothing bad will happen here, but on a different layout ....|pg||

mb|2D|mb|p|mb|3D|nt|psridhar: wait till u see an entry shifting squeeze landing a slam Geoffrey :)|pg||
mb|3N|nt|rmb1: Teltscher team (NS) is Silverstone, Forrester, Gold. Townsend, Bakhshi (sp?)|pg||
nt|roswolf: well 3nt seems to be popular today|pg||
nt|Walddk2: South had better take this out into spades|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rmb1: EW probably P Hackett and Waterlow|pg||
pc|c4|nt|Walddk2: oh well|pg||
nt|Walddk2: what happened to 4th best from my longest and strongest?|pg||
nt|roswolf: east's weak 2 in diamonds(!?) worked but south seeemed to be asleep|pg||
nt|roswolf: is David Gold north?|pg||

pc|c2|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|Walddk2: You can make 3NT double dummy even on a diamond lead but you won't at the table|pg||
nt|rmb1: Looks like the pairings are still in transition.  The talk is that Gold/Townsend are playing less and Gold/Forrester is the new pairing|pg||
nt|psridhar: East had to fig out if that 3nt was HCP based ( dia lead right) OR long suit based ( i pref dia but may be he thought, pd to get in and play dia thru)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So Gold it is after all. Bakhshi is East in the closed room|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 2@H|pg||
nt|ady: Brunner not opening vul with a ragged suit|pg||
nt|yo_yo: who is East,  Bakhshi is in both rooms|pg||
mb|2N|nt|garnetts: Not sure if NS use a 12-14 1NT --but even so I think this hand needs upgrading --too good for 15-17|pg||
mb|p|mb|3S|nt|blum1956: why not open weak 2@s? Or Multi? |pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes  12-14|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|haans: bidding today make them go to 3 level|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Strange lead|pg||
nt|garnetts: Likely think that it is too balanced and the suit is too weak at red|pg||
pc|d5|nt|pelu: hi all|pg||
nt|blum1956: This leads to a probable disaster|pg||
nt|garnetts: Poor suit--more defensive than attacking|pg||

pc|sK|nt|mcarroll: Hi Peter|pg||
pc|s2|nt|garnetts: but it works well |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Call me naive, but I would have led a spade|pg||
pc|s3|nt|blum1956: no way to go down in 4@s (almost)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: @C lead in other room|pg||
nt|ady: Q@C well place this will get home   also diamonds 4-4   |pg||
nt|garnetts: I think both NS judged well --one to pass as South and the other to upgrade the North hand---but the final decision to stay in 3NT is a poot one--South gave North a choice and 4@S ...|pg||
nt|garnetts: should have been bid |pg||
nt|yo_yo: easy make on  @C lead|pg||
nt|blum1956: Today more and more players open weak two with 6-card whatever quality one is|pg||
nt|blum1956: 6-card or player ))))|pg||
nt|garnetts: They do--and in my view their card play rarely live up to their expectations--a triumph of hope over experience |pg||

nt|roswolf: yes a bid swing missed by not6 leading their suit east believed the opps always a dangerous thing to do|pg||
mb|1C|nt|roswolf: big swing|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: 20 board segments test your stamina|pg||
mb|1S|nt|roswolf: a spec suggests perhaps W should double for partner to lead D - i think that was a good point|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|psridhar: but in line with world championships like the Bermuda Bowl|pg||

mb|p|nt|garnetts: I cannot see any reason to make 4@S  |pg||
mb|p|pc|c6|nt|yo_yo: 2@D presumably asks for the better major|pg||
nt|garnetts: Yes|pg||
nt|blum1956: this time 3NT looks slightly better|pg||
nt|garnetts: East sees no reason to do anything other than bid 3NT--things are well placed for 4@H--best lead from North though |pg||
nt|garnetts: I meant 4@H not 3NT sorry|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c8|nt|haans: had myself bid 4@C |pg||
nt|garnetts: might on a club lead even then not certain |pg||
nt|garnetts: I like 4@C as it helps partner to judge --but usually is shows more length doesn't it?  |pg||
pc|c3|pg||
pc|dK|nt|haans: we can talk about that :)|pg||
nt|pelu: no 4@C = fit to @D and values in @C|pg||
pc|dA|pc|h5|pc|d2|pg||
nt|garnetts: 4@S is very poorly disciplined |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Excellent judgement by Gui. 4@S is as dead as a dead chruch rat|pg||
nt|Walddk2: church  even|pg||
nt|garnetts: ask partner for a view and then ignore it--this hsould be a slam try sequence |pg||

mb|1S|nt|roswolf: no a new partnership|pg||

nt|rmb1: 2@H GF?  Or does everyone bid game on West hand?|pg||
nt|psridhar: club lead wd hv worked better|pg||
pc|s7|nt|Walddk2: 2@H is game-forcing, yes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Unfortunately no convention cards available, but I have the one for EW here  ... and also for Crouch-Patterson if we need that later|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think it is gf but west would always be in game - that's his style|pg||
nt|psridhar: now they hv to find the club shift, i think they will, with N having cl as the onlt picture card while handing the ruff|pg||
nt|roswolf: especially after the first few boards|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The EBU should really require that CCs are submitted, then put on display on the website. I think we all agree here|pg||
nt|psridhar: in case Gold is wondering if the lead is stiff jack or JX, he might remember pd led THEIR suit|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed - which relay system is peter crouch playing - the strong club version?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Walddk2: yes|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I have a file that took me 5 minutes to download!|pg||

nt|Walddk2: with all those suit symbols|pg||
nt|Walddk2: @C2 presumably|pg||
nt|Walddk2: @S2|pg||
nt|roswolf: it is a very fine theorectical effort- but has some holes which can be exploited by aggressive opp bidding|pg||
nt|psridhar: Townsend found a bid over 1nt opg deal 3. Hackett passed 1c |pg||
nt|psridhar: so Teltscher off to a flier -30 for no loss in 3 overs :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I suspect Forrester will switch to a club regardless of which spade is returned|pg||
nt|roswolf: a fine effort by e/w in the other room to get to game on bd3 - teltscher has started very strongly|pg||
nt|psridhar: sorry for the cricket analogy...it is cricket fever in India once again now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I lost interest in Eng v Pak here|pg||

nt|Walddk2: He switched to @CQ |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Gold facing the same dilemma here|pg||

nt|rmb1: The nuanced @S4|pg||

mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|blum1956: even if this is not the case the opponents will be often in trouble in the hearts game the opener having that kind of a hand|pg||
mb|d|an|No Agreement|nt|garnetts: If West had opned 2@S is North really going to double?  Certainly won't bid 3@H |pg||
nt|ady: 10 imps for Hacket on board 9  where 6@H went down 1 in open room|pg||
nt|yo_yo: what?  no agreement? |pg||
mb|p|an|<3!Hs|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|garnetts: It looks as if Twonsend thinks this shows a hand that would have made a penalty double of 1NT|pg||
nt|yo_yo: some play the double as penalty of a weak NT|pg||
nt|ady: n/s could be in difficulty here if e/w keep doubling|pg||
nt|yo_yo: some play it shows @D|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: if east can double showing values  west will surely pass|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|garnetts: I prefer the agreement that x is pens after a weak notrump and a suit after a strong/medium notrump |pg||

mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|pelu: where did N find that X???|pg||

nt|blum1956: Against weak NT it is better to play "diamonds or strong, starting from a strong NT"|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: Some decided to dbl 3NT next door--someone should have redoubled |pg||
nt|ady: 9 tricks look a lot|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|garnetts: This is truely poor bridge from EW--|pg||
nt|yo_yo: there's not better about either, just depends which hand comes along|pg||

nt|yo_yo: they are a newish partnership|pg||
nt|ady: Q@H favourable this should make|pg||
nt|blum1956: the strongest part of the weak NT - you make the opponents not to know their HCP's. They often land in 22-23 HCP 3NT. Still you nead to beat that.|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h3|pc|h2|nt|garnetts: well I am moaning the lead was awful--and South should have doubled |pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|garnetts: South must double to keep EDW honest and North on track--so he doesn't look elsewhere for a lead like he has |pg||
nt|ady: e/w have useful lower diamond pips|pg||
pc|dT|nt|yo_yo: I am corrected, Townsend/Bakhshi not a "newish" partner|pg||
nt|yo_yo: a NEW partnership|pg||
nt|blum1956: the game of bridge is not that all for high card points|pg||
nt|garnetts: NS doing well for EW on this hand|pg||
nt|garnetts: it is interesting and instructional to see play like this and where it stems from---North started with a bad lead because he though his side needed to find fast tricks  |pg||
nt|blum1956: West must establish a trick in a minor suit  to discard his 4th heart|pg||
nt|garnetts: If Souht had doubled then his opening lead would have been like ace and another heart |pg||
nt|garnetts: this would also have left dec to get on with it and he would have no chance |pg||
nt|garnetts: Shows that bridge relies upon so many tells -|pg||
nt|blum1956: is he going not to play the @dQ??|pg||
