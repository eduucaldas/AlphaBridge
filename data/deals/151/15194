pc|cQ|pc|c4|pc|c8|pc|d4|pg||
nt|bobh1: one problem with stayman is that it can give the defense gratuitous information if you end in 3N anyway|pg||

pc|sT|mc|12|nt|drewsky: Mr. Roth said to bid stayman and then 3NT no matter what opener responded, but if the pulled 3NT to 4M that he has to be 4-4 in the majors and thus would have ruffing value !|pg||

nt|ralfwil: after a @s lead a small @d to dummu and a @h to 10. works this time|pg||

nt|bobh1: well the @c finesse is a chance|pg||
nt|ralfwil: thatÂ´s an option|pg||
