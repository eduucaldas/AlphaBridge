nt|panosk: anyway 4cl were possible E-W got a 100 so maybe an imp there, not the end of the world|pg||
nt|mcphee: true|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s6|pc|s5|nt|mcphee: missed the 4-4 @S fit here|pg||
nt|panosk: but coupled with the other room raises to 7|pg||
pc|sA|pg||

pc|c2|pc|dT|pc|c8|nt|mcphee: not sure why W rebid 1N, perhaps this is their style with balanced hands|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|cT|pc|d4|pc|c6|pc|dJ|pg||
pc|c4|pc|s9|pc|c9|mc|6|nt|panosk: that was a serious offence to stay on that legal tone of yours Bob|pg||
nt|mcphee: pre alert, technically it is alertable|pg||
nt|mcphee: sorry wrong spot|pg||
nt|mcphee: this match seems to be what will happen with 2@H down 200 from board 1|pg||
nt|mcphee: can the Suns find 7 imps from that hand, it will be close possibility|pg||
nt|mcphee: 6 imps is very possible|pg||
nt|panosk: spyro any problem there?|pg||
nt|mcphee: the board in question n/s have driven to 3@S|pg||
nt|panosk: in the most plausible way I may add|pg||
nt|mcphee: the final board we saw N steal a 12th trick in 3N|pg||
nt|mcphee: this will be a close set|pg||
nt|panosk: we have 2 more boards here dont we?|pg||
nt|mcphee: here we are done, just waiting for the speedy room to catch up|pg||
nt|panosk: no sorry was looking at the other table's results|pg||
nt|mcphee: the other room has found the assault on trumps with a @C lead|pg||
nt|mcphee: am matter of how many down|pg||
nt|mcphee: so it might well be that the board we saw down in 1@H for 200 becomes a push|pg||
nt|mcphee: rodos suns opportunity evaporates|pg||
nt|panosk: no but only 3sp-1 and 3 imps to the suns|pg||
nt|mcphee: just 1 down |pg||
nt|mcphee: so it appears that Zaleski will dodminate here winning by 4 imps|pg||
nt|mcphee: dominate|pg||
nt|mcphee: as the final board is likely 1 imp pickyo|pg||
nt|panosk:  still a gd result for the Suns, rest of the teams that played Zaleski didnt do as much|pg||
nt|mcphee: a respectable loss as they say|pg||
nt|panosk: exactly like Bob predicted another imp for pick up at the last board|pg||
nt|vugraphztf: Suns is a team of local players and it is very important for them to be shown on table 1 and BBO :) It is difficult for players in islands to find good opponents for practice as ...|pg||
nt|vugraphztf: well as good teachers |pg||
nt|mcphee: see you all later, about 15 mins again I suspect|pg||
