nt|jcwla: a tie and a loss. Any difference in the score, no matter how small, decides the board. We will have 6 tables in play at all times.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|jcwla: Essentially, this becomes Super-Matchpoints: every overtrick, every undertrick, the difference between playing in No Trump versus a Major may decide the board.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@D is constructive|pg||
nt|jcwla: For simplicity, we are using the European style of 2 points for a win, 1 point for a tie and 0 points for a loss.|pg||

pc|c4|nt|mdgraham: Hi Jordan|pg||
nt|mdgraham: On the last board, East may be weak with a long suit. Lebensohl comes in handy (2NT puppets 3@C, then you can bid your long suit). A diretc bid shows reasonable values.|pg||

mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 3@S likely a fragment-style bid, as South did not bid 1@S over 1@H |pg||

nt|mdgraham: North not content with 6@D at pairs. But a club lead may be interesting  |pg||
nt|odysseus69: sure to make after the take out double|pg||
nt|odysseus69: west will be thrown in to concede 2 spade tricks|pg||
nt|rmb1: I guess there is a strip squeeze on a club lead|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|odysseus69: also could duck and squeeze as long as he reads distribution-not a problem either way |pg||
pc|d4|nt|mdgraham: the t/o double places virtually all the high cards - just room for East to hold @SJ perhaps|pg||
pc|d9|pc|dQ|nt|rmb1: Doesn't duck and squeeze require West to have @SJ, which is only card he might not have|pg||
nt|odysseus69: no - spade jack not relevant|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|mdgraham: although West may reduce to a singleton K in spades - but North will get it right  |pg||
nt|rmb1: The plan is for south to have SQx and winning diamond, and North to have SAx and C10.  |pg||
nt|dimi: Nunes has to hold @c K and @s K, so there is no chance to escape the squeeze|pg||
nt|odysseus69: N/S areboth Jill- North Jill Levin -now corrected-wife of Bobby Levin|pg||
mc|12|nt|rmb1: When South cashes the diamond, either the C10 or SQ will become a winner|pg||

nt|mdgraham: I wonder if 3@S puppets 3NT, then 4@D=club slam try|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|mb|4N|nt|mdgraham: The opening bid of 2NT is often described as the "slam-killer" |pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1D|mb|p|nt|jcwla: 6NT normally calls for a "don't kick a trick lead" -- a twist here b/c S not a balanced hand, but still would be a contender for lead of the year had E found a @D there.|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|nt|odysseus69: East passes on barren 12 - good idea but others will be less prudent|pg||

pc|h5|nt|mdgraham: whether you open or not on theEast hand is very much a matter of what partner has|pg||

pc|hT|nt|odysseus69: heading for 9 ticks|pg||
