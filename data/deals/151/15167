mb|2N|an|min|mb|p|mb|3C!|an|inv with clubs|mb|p|nt|garnetts: looks like he will show a spade fragment and heart shortage with both minors --or maybe just 5@C/4@D|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|henryb:  Some people in the US used to play that a jump to 3 of a major showed a stiff in that major, three cards in the other, and 5-4 in the minors|pg||
pc|h4|nt|bjacobs: Not just the US|pg||
nt|garnetts: Here too |pg||
pc|h3|pc|hJ|pc|hK|pg||
nt|garnetts: seems to me that showing five ==more likely six clubs and bidding 3NT to express doubt excluded diamonds and spades |pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h2|pc|s2|pc|h7|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Guessing is not my kind of game, so you may take your own guess if you care. However, I have encouraged the EBU to have the CCs displayed on the website, and Max Bavin agrees. So ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: this is step 1 in the right direction|pg||
nt|henryb:  Most have abandoned it by now, using the jumps for other things. Responding to 1N is a very fluid area in bridge theory|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c4|pc|c3|pc|c6|pg||
nt|garnetts: Must be better methods out there |pg||
nt|vugraphzda: David asks about smith|pg||

pc|h9|pg||
nt|henryb:  the @dK lead would have had a chance to beat this|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good one, Bill :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: since it is apparent that dec is cashing out--what is the point of the question?  |pg||
nt|Walddk2: How many Smith's do they have in England?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It seemed a fair bet ... but of course he's asking about the Smith defensive convention|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d2|pc|dJ|nt|Walddk2: One can probably google it, but I am too lazy|pg||

nt|lestergold: welcome specs to the first of todays encounters|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|Walddk4: Hi Shirley|pg||

nt|sybarra: Roland and Geoffrey |pg||
nt|Walddk4: We may need it|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: 2@D = SPADES AND ANOTHER I THINK|pg||

nt|ady: good morning Kath   David|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hello from Manchester|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: Hi all. Welcome to Solihull|pg||
nt|ady: not much difficulty   especially on likely heart lead|pg||
nt|yo_yo: we saw Townsend & Bakhshi put up a great performance this time yesterday|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|mb|3N|nt|Walddk4: 15-17 in 3rd and 4th|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: Good morning everyone |pg||
nt|roswolf: yes lots of transfer responses on a strong club base|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3nt has perhaps a chance, but not 4@s|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: anyone know the results?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: did they keep it up?|pg||
nt|lestergold: all strong players here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Results from round 1: Rosen v Senior 25-4 ; Teltscher v P Hackett 19-11 ; Small v Hinden 17-13, and de Botton v Crouch 16-14|pg||
nt|yo_yo: david are there any results online?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Division 2: FEGARTY beat ROBERTS 25-5; PRYOR beat BIRD 25-5; COOPER beat SHILLITOE 23-7; DHONDY beat COPE 18-11 (Cope was penalised 1 VP for slow play)|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: Players seem very chipper for such an early hour|pg||
pc|h4|nt|garnetts: I agree Roland but with AQ stiff it is a reasonable bid as long as it cannot be passed |pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s play a standard 5 card major system i think - relatively uncommom in acol land|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hJ|nt|yo_yo: good morning from Manchester|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hello from Manchester|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|ralfwil: this lead can help declarer|pg||

nt|yo_yo: that's very impressive yes :)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mcarroll: another double fit in the Majors|pg||
nt|garnetts: West doing a lot of bidding |pg||
nt|yo_yo: hello again ralf :)|pg||
pc|h2|pc|s2|pc|h7|pg||
nt|lestergold: predictable lead which stes up 3 heart tricks for declarer|pg||
nt|lestergold: curse the cards!|pg||
pc|cK|nt|Walddk2: Sandqvist - McIntosh are members of the England open team, and Crouch-Patterson have won the Camrose Trophy for England|pg||
nt|roswolf: both very good pairs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Sandqcist originally from Sweden, Tosh from Scotland|pg||
nt|sybarra: defense has to be a bit careful here|pg||
pc|c2|nt|haans: spade loser soon|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c6|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Michelle must have been having kittens with that awful south hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: cashing out|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c4|nt|sybarra: wisely |pg||
pc|c5|pc|cT|pg||
nt|garnetts: yes easier to play the ace and finesse |pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: but he sin't  doing that |pg||
nt|garnetts: Must admit I cannot see much wrong with 1@H and if I had managed to bid 2@H --then 3@D wouldn't have been on my mind |pg||
nt|yo_yo: 2@H would be a 6 card suit with me|pg||
nt|blum1956: hi all|pg||
nt|ady: hi|pg||
nt|garnetts: In the balancing position here 2@H should be say a decent six card suit and a reasonable hand --what used to be called intermediate |pg||
pc|c7|pc|c8|nt|roswolf: the ace of clubs wont run away|pg||
pc|c9|nt|ralfwil: 9 tricks with a correct play in @c|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|sybarra: yes it will |pg||
pc|d2|nt|sybarra: 10 9 of spades and the good @D?|pg||
nt|roswolf: oh yes|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 4@c, 2@h, 2@s and 1@d = 9|pg||
pc|s5|nt|roswolf: oops|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This line is scary. It's not a good idea to shorten the long hand when you also have fit in a side suit|pg||
nt|garnetts: West should hold his cards up lol  |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nothing bad will happen here, but on a different layout ....|pg||
nt|haans: tme for a clubs ruff|pg||
nt|haans: time|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes  has to make 4@C tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: a 'double dummy' @d lead would probably be only lead to put declarer undr serious pressure here|pg||
nt|ady: may only make 9 obvious tricks|pg||

nt|Walddk2: They are vul, we are not|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, it's all about the vulnerability|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Take what you can get|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|pc|sK|nt|roswolf: absolutely with a 20 count most of us would bid something - |pg||
nt|henryb:  I would overcall 3N, but who am I|pg||
nt|vugraphzda: bell asks about quality - pretty sound|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I wouldn't at these colours|pg||
nt|vugraphzda: Gold puts down dummy: "would you believe it"|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|pc|s5|pg||
nt|garnetts: Me too Henry--especially if I paid an entry fee |pg||
nt|roswolf: i would too obviously my style is erroneous|pg||
nt|vugraphzda: Forrester: "incredible"|pg||
nt|bjacobs: West is of course delighted by the sight of dummy, meaning that his partner has zip|pg||
nt|vugraphzda: Bell thinking, head in hands|pg||

mb|p|nt|roswolf: a blow for de botton|pg||
mb|3D|nt|lestergold: er yes basically altho they still paly in some things|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: 2@C - THE MAJORS|pg||
nt|ralfwil: remaining @s from dummy and S is squeezed|pg||
nt|yo_yo: if 1NT is 15-18 why the delay?|pg||
nt|ady: not likely to make|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|mcarroll: "Interesting" a very broad term  |pg||
nt|yo_yo: i hope tony forrester doesnt shout at your son|pg||
pc|sK|nt|roswolf: taking advantage of the vul|pg||
nt|sybarra: might end the 4/3 with X or 3 nt|pg||
pc|s4|nt|Walddk2: 2@H|pg||
nt|ady: Brunner not opening vul with a ragged suit|pg||
nt|yo_yo: who is East,  Bakhshi is in both rooms|pg||
nt|lestergold: n/sneeed to bid this tight vul 3N whoch as cards lie should make|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 2@C probably stayman|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I doubt N can make 3nt after a @s lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: Small max will accept the invite which is on the way|pg||
pc|s2|nt|garnetts: Not sure if NS use a 12-14 1NT --but even so I think this hand needs upgrading --too good for 15-17|pg||

nt|othered1: Hi, everyone!|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi ED|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello Ed |pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|ady: fantastic pass from West    winning action|pg||
pc|sA|nt|blum1956: why not open weak 2@s? Or Multi? |pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes  12-14|pg||
nt|lestergold: er my son has a louder voice and is a lot bigger!|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s3|pc|sJ|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and for me a @s lead is natural as E|pg||
nt|lestergold: i c defence can establish 2 spades 2 clubs and a heart |pg||
pc|hA|nt|sybarra: should roll this one home,  not sure E can ever get in   |pg||
nt|roswolf: thyis looks like a make - west will be embarassed on the run of the minors|pg||
nt|lestergold: dim lead would let it thru|pg||
pc|h2|nt|haans: bidding today make them go to 3 level|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Strange lead|pg||
nt|garnetts: Likely think that it is too balanced and the suit is too weak at red|pg||
nt|sybarra: and clubs are 3/3 |pg||
nt|lestergold: am i seeing things here|pg||
pc|hT|nt|pelu: hi all|pg||
nt|blum1956: This leads to a probable disaster|pg||
nt|garnetts: Poor suit--more defensive than attacking|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|cT|pc|cQ|pc|c7|nt|mcarroll: Hi Peter|pg||
nt|lestergold: Townsend chos the  right time to pass but i would have thought an action with his big hand was noprmal like 3N|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|garnetts: but it works well |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Call me naive, but I would have led a spade|pg||
pc|s7|nt|blum1956: no way to go down in 4@s (almost)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: @C lead in other room|pg||
nt|ady: Q@C well place this will get home   also diamonds 4-4   |pg||
nt|garnetts: I think both NS judged well --one to pass as South and the other to upgrade the North hand---but the final decision to stay in 3NT is a poot one--South gave North a choice and 4@S ...|pg||
nt|garnetts: should have been bid |pg||
nt|yo_yo: easy make on  @C lead|pg||
nt|blum1956: Today more and more players open weak two with 6-card whatever quality one is|pg||
nt|blum1956: 6-card or player ))))|pg||
nt|garnetts: They do--and in my view their card play rarely live up to their expectations--a triumph of hope over experience |pg||
pc|s9|pc|d2|nt|yo_yo: I suppose John wanted to protect K@D|pg||

nt|lestergold: well dop u agree with Townsend'spass david?|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|haans: Hi Peter|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ralfwil: Best play from E is to discard @s6 on next @c|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ady: maybe Townsend tht 3@D likley if east had anything   that +300 would not be a great loss  and if partner had nothing would gain |pg||
mc|8|nt|roswolf: a very odd view imo|pg||

mb|2D|mb|p|nt|roswolf: good slam here|pg||

nt|garnetts: My idea of a weak two |pg||
nt|garnetts: four lever ?|pg||
nt|garnetts: level |pg||
nt|bjacobs: Any of you guys play 4@C here as: "bid the suit below your suit"?|pg||
nt|vugraphzda: either north or east could be thinking here, there are screens|pg||
nt|roswolf: if north raises to 4@H p/c life will be interesting|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I do, Bill|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: It's not a bad example ... North hiding his hand here is a good idea|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|nt|garnetts: Looks like this might be the 2@D fertiliser bid with 2@H/@S being decent weak twos |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Daylight robbery|pg||
pc|hK|nt|Walddk2: I blame West more than East|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is incredible east i think must take some action|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Get in over the Multi right away|pg||
nt|vugraphzda: NS discussing what 4@C and 4@D are|pg||
nt|vugraphzda: they didn't agree|pg||

pc|h2|pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d7|pc|d2|pc|d3|pg||
nt|bjacobs: As it turns out, it's a good thing they didn't bid 4@D ... this is what got E/W into the auction in the CR|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hT|nt|garnetts: Seems to me that EW should have a method--used to play that 2@H or 2@H were take out doubles of the opposite major |pg||
nt|bjacobs: Was that called DIxon?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But another good example of how important it is to get in in 2nd seat right away over the Multi|pg||
nt|garnetts: Whatever West should act immediately |pg||
nt|roswolf: east to me had an obvious double of 4@H and an obvious 5@D bid over 4@S but then i am a bidder and not a passer by temprament|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But West's hand was marginal ... I have a lot of sympathy for them here ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He has the perfect shape for a TO double of spades, no?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: West might have been planning to make a TO double of spades ...|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 2@S, in particular|pg||
nt|garnetts: Absolutely right Roland |pg||
nt|bjacobs: But when it came back to him at 4@S, it was a bit high|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h5|pg||

pc|dJ|pc|d9|pc|d4|pc|s2|pg||
pc|sA|pc|sT|pc|s3|pc|s6|pg||

pc|sK|pc|sQ|pc|s7|nt|bjacobs: It's just an 11 count|pg||
nt|garnetts: With a strong hand pass and bid is OK |pg||

nt|Walddk2: It's an 11 count with 1444|pg||

nt|Walddk2: That must compensate|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c3|pc|cA|pg||

nt|Walddk2: when you have support for all "unbid" suits|pg||

mb|1C!|nt|henryb:  Last time I acted with the West hand over Multi, South had a weak two in hearts and North had a strong NT with a doubleton heart.|pg||

pc|s3|pc|sK|nt|roswolf: blood will flow but whose it is not clear|pg||

nt|Walddk2: He will play the hand accordingly|pg||
nt|sybarra: or maybe 4441 |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nah|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He would never double with that hand|pg||
nt|othered1: Mightn't he think north may be thinking that south had something for the vulnerable opening bid, even 3rd hand?|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry what amn i talking about 2 off|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lestergold: hard for partner to read this|pg||

pc|s2|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes and the side suit is @h!|pg||
pc|c8|nt|haans: two yes for one no :)|pg||

nt|lestergold: i dont think 3N is a likely spot here|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sybarra: E has to NOT play trumps |pg||
nt|Walddk2: If Crouch reads this, North can be endplayed to lead away from @HK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That is why a heart switch was needed at trick 2|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes cash out the side suits|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But he has to guess North's shape|pg||

nt|sybarra: ace and a @H now?|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Then it is also easy|pg||

nt|othered1: and 3@D?  Puppet?|pg||

pc|s5|nt|othered1: North can likely infer that @S are 3-3 at most in EW  hands|pg||

nt|lestergold: its a moot point borderline my point is that Towsend sholuld have consulted|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sT|nt|Walddk2: Lucky that hearts are 3-3. He can test if @CJ10 doubleton first by cashing one of them|pg||

mb|2H|nt|haans: SZ coming|pg||

nt|blum1956: EW probably catched up|pg||
nt|garnetts: yes xx was punitive|pg||
nt|sybarra: singleton honors worth ?  (zip)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Mike Bell also passed 3@D in the OR on 2|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I like Gan's choice of 1NT in the closed room, rather than double|pg||
nt|garnetts: Anyone for 1NT on the West cards raher then dbl? |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Jxx often a nice holding|pg||
nt|pelu: diff to see the @H-stop in 3Nt - in CR West reopen 1NT - so......|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: The 470 was worth 8 IMPs, 110 at the other table|pg||
nt|yo_yo: very odd|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: I like 1NT a lot more--because I hate double |pg||
nt|garnetts: If North doubles South might lead the K@H |pg||
nt|garnetts: Very well done by John here |pg||
nt|blum1956: was West's double of 1NT strong or 1-suiter? Probably strong|pg||
nt|blum1956: otherwise East shoud not pass by 2@c|pg||
nt|garnetts: I did not like the 2@D bid--why not just pass and leave it to partner?  Unless it showed a desire to play in 1NT xx|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i dont think you have to alert a penalty double of 1NT|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but other penalty doubles are now alertable|pg||
nt|garnetts: West double was penalty oriented I am fiarly sure |pg||
nt|garnetts: essential to have that option against 12-14 0r weaker |pg||
nt|blum1956: anyway EW are in serious trouble|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|othered1: Looks like 3N doesn'thave much play at all on @H lead.|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @S raising @D?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i wish i understood this bidding|pg||
nt|lestergold: slam looks well below 59%|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 2¬@h doesnt mke|pg||
nt|ady: North decided to keep out of bidding     not unreasonable|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ady: west considering 3@C   not an immediate success|pg||
nt|blum1956: perfect lead!|pg||
pc|sK|nt|pelu: only 2@D on 14 HCP???????????????|pg||
nt|sybarra: Simon Cope says:  no - relay shape ask I am pretty sure|pg||
nt|lestergold: 60%|pg||
nt|lestergold: 50% i mean|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s8|nt|mcarroll: I agree, especially when you see where double leads to|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6 losers unavoidable|pg||
pc|s9|nt|othered1: The double may help NS here.  Why double when you are quite likely on lead?|pg||
nt|sybarra: S would love to have the ace to send it back |pg||
nt|Walddk2: I said it before and I will say it again. The EBU must require that all convention cards are submitted and then put on display on the website. It is unreasonable that commentators ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: must guess what certain bids mean|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I'll have a word with Max Bavin|pg||
nt|othered1: Agree|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|garnetts: I would rather have passed the double than bid 2@D |pg||
nt|haans: original bid|pg||
pc|d5|nt|sybarra: I have found that the cc's typically posted are only part of the story,  but would be nice|pg||
nt|yo_yo: nice lead for King|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d2|nt|sybarra: (also in little tiny print) |pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's a miracle that I have the EW card. I have because Crouch sent it to me|pg||
nt|othered1: Most don't get terribly deep into relay development|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It took me 5 minutes to download the comprehensive version of the EW CC|pg||
nt|sybarra: the cc's hardly give the details for relays,  agree ED |pg||
nt|Walddk2: There is also a shorter version I have on hand|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|haans: i would have tried 3@D :)|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|blum1956: ruff out, play trumps and then a spade|pg||
pc|d4|nt|garnetts: Yes of course Haans :) rofl |pg||
nt|mcarroll: I would have tried 2@H with the E hand|pg||
nt|garnetts: Roland explained to me that out operators are new to this and it is very tought job--in my view Darren is doing brilliantly so far --may not be able to note all alerts this first ...|pg||
nt|garnetts: time |pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: Cheers, I am new but Roger is an old hand, you'll have David and Ant later who are both experts!|pg||
pc|d6|nt|lestergold: making 5|pg||

pc|s6|nt|haans: :)|pg||

pc|c5|pc|dT|nt|mcarroll: I think 1NT is the most descriptive bid,as it does not promise a @H stop|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|haans: best way to find 3nt  is not caring about stoppers|pg||
nt|ady: looks like the defence wont be able to get 2 club tricks    the 4th diamond will be a discard|pg||

pc|c5|pc|c4|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 3@D is the bid you make with @SAxxxx @Hxxx @DAKxx  @Cx|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Does everyone support spades at this point by bidding 3@C? What a about a negative double first?|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cT|pc|c3|pc|c7|pg||
nt|vugraphzda: Gold studying this trick in detail|pg||
nt|ritong: i ilke the idea of a double first|pg||
nt|bjacobs: You reckon, Roland, that the 432 of spades (specifically) is a signal from God, perhaps.  (I also like the negative double)|pg||
nt|garnetts: I like dbl too|pg||
nt|ritong: raising as soon as possible is important, but this hand looks like an exception|pg||
nt|bjacobs: What could go wrong?  Suppose it goes ... d'ble, 3@C, pass, pass ... now 3@S is about right?|pg||
nt|roswolf: i would double first but then in my agreements 3@C would DENY @H with 3 card support - not a common agreement|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|Walddk2: My point is that a 4-4 heart fit often plays better, and over 3@C I don't think 3@H shows a suit, a game try rather. Could be three cards|pg||

nt|lestergold: no game here for e/w|pg||
mb|2C|nt|haans: The Complete Book of Balasncing Mike Lawrence|pg||

mb|3C!|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 2@D  5+ hearts  9+ hcp|pg||
nt|roswolf: transfer|pg||
mb|3D|nt|ady: 4@S for n/s|pg||

nt|lestergold: east may likem his diamond fit|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: It's like 20/20 cricket, run rate required per over almost 10|pg||
nt|sybarra: in the category of "oh good"........|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: at last a penalty double bid as penalty taken as penalty|pg||
nt|garnetts: transfer weak twos --interesting |pg||
nt|blum1956: looks like for EW more hands are suitable for a weak two|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@H   NF|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not a pretty fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Patterson could also have rebid 2@S which is also non-forcing|pg||
nt|sybarra: an understatement Roland |pg||
nt|othered1: Possible for NS also to  play @H, if EW decide not to enter the auction.  But that's not the modern approach|pg||
nt|roswolf: this sort of hand shows the bow and arrow nature of these responses - remember opener is limited by his failure to open 1@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: Tosh asking what hands Patterson wouldn't bid 2@h|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You know you are in trouble when the opponents start drawing trumps|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But down in 50's|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes indeed|pg||
nt|sybarra: we call it "only 50's"|pg||

nt|yo_yo: Frances|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|yo_yo: doesnt it just give opps an extra bid?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: gained 12 imps for her team on 4|pg||
nt|lestergold: i wouldnt venture into this auction with that pile of festering horse manure with a gun to my head|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cT|nt|Walddk2: This is quite funny; an opener with no entry to his hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If this can be called an opener of course, but it is for them|pg||
pc|c2|nt|garnetts: in my view it does |pg||
nt|blum1956: It is fair when there is some strong option covered by the same bid|pg||
nt|ady: 4-1 spade split no problem with clubs behaving|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Mrs Bakhshi thinks it's a multi |pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: Ah!  Yes, looking at the wrong part of the card :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: On baord six they missed 7@H because the 5@D bids was exclusion blackwood and they could not locate the Q@H it seems |pg||
nt|ady: could they not have bid 5NT  immediately rather than 5@D?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes 5NT  asks about top honours|pg||
nt|ady: or maybe he tht Q@H not needed with a 6 or 7 card suit headed by the ace|pg||
nt|garnetts: That is my view David---seems that neither South worked out the potential--in Both rooms North showed six hearts--what else is needed--maybe just knwledge of the ace of trumps--who ...|pg||
nt|garnetts: cares about the queen when you ten including the AK |pg||
nt|yo_yo: a former team mate to Cameron Small so it's doubly satisfying for her I guess :)|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: David Bird must be a happy man today. His county, Hampshire, won the 20/20 trophy|pg||
nt|garnetts: Do not mention 20/20 after Somerste lost yesterday sensitive issue here--especially if Jane is watching |pg||
nt|garnetts: You will make her mad Roland|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes Roland, but in 20/20 10 per over is eminently achievable - especially if an inform Gilchrist is batting|pg||

pc|h2|pc|hA|pc|h3|mc|9|nt|sybarra: old fashioned forcing nt might have solved this problem ending in 2 @D's or so |pg||
nt|lestergold: unfortunately i think with Towsned's minimum 12 count and awful spade suit his 3@d bid which is effectivbely a game try was an overbid|pg||

pc|cK|nt|roswolf: if 2@D was constructive 5@D LOOKS VERY PESSIMISTIC|pg||

mb|3H|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Fortunately, the lack of @H9 means that 5@H will make|pg||

mb|1H|nt|haans: More INFO: zhoufly: hu is the sponsor of his team|pg||
nt|garnetts: symetrical stiff kings here--Culbertson would be pleased |pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: This is an excellent slam but I think impossible to bid |pg||
nt|othered1: is double meaningful?|pg||
nt|roswolf: no but slam seems to be far away from north's point of view|pg||
nt|roswolf: and this caters for the big bal hand option|pg||
nt|yo_yo: maybe he realised he had done the wrong thing earlier so tried to redress it|pg||

mb|4H|mb|p|nt|roswolf: on 10 the twins avoided the slam|pg||
nt|sybarra: S not giving that as option for W |pg||
nt|Walddk2: No, Liggins-Whittaker did|pg||
nt|roswolf: ok same difference:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6NT bid to protect @SK but he does not have enough tricks|pg||
nt|othered1: 6N doesn't have a play I can see|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but double followed bye @D might not be forcing|pg||
nt|lestergold: however should be headed for the club game either way|pg||
nt|lestergold: selway should downvalue with so much in clubs opposite the splinter|pg||
nt|yo_yo: would you splinter with the South hand?|pg||
nt|ady: north not really interested in more than game with such good club values opposite a shortage|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|garnetts: dbl defeats me as a bid--4@D seems logical --but dbl?   |pg||
nt|garnetts: 4@C in response is odd too--might get passed so 4@D maybe  |pg||
nt|blum1956: again that antiLaw board - 22 total trumps but far less total tricks|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes i would splinter|pg||
nt|lestergold: perfect hand for it|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lestergold: straight off the chest|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|Walddk2: lol|pg||
nt|roswolf: north bidding a grand -surely a surplus of imagination|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Well, it might have made when we get a week with two Fridays|pg||
nt|lestergold: landed right spot|pg||
nt|ady: 5 level would have been dangerous |pg||
pc|sA|nt|garnetts: Culbertson put forward a theory of symetrical distributions--where there was a shapely hand with a singleton likely to be another similar hand |pg||
nt|roswolf: needs a month of sundays|pg||
nt|Walddk2: @SA is perhaps a little insulting|pg||
nt|othered1: This isn't doubled, but west clearly would have doubled 7@D.|pg||
nt|sybarra: sort of why not? shortening some one some where|pg||
nt|roswolf: why - when opps bid this way insults are deserved|pg||
nt|othered1: Only very slightly nsulting.  This hasn't exactly been a confident auction|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Crouch has no defence against 7@D or 7NT so he can't double 7@C|pg||
nt|roswolf: the imp score wont be too different even if doubled!|pg||

nt|Walddk2: A quiet 2 down it seems|pg||
nt|sybarra: I can hear the groan over here|pg||

nt|lestergold: well i promise 4 H or a hand good enuf to cope with any acrtion by my pard|pg||
nt|ady: 20-20 here|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|mb|p|nt|blum1956: even if this is not the case the opponents will be often in trouble in the hearts game the opener having that kind of a hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: If West had opned 2@S is North really going to double?  Certainly won't bid 3@H |pg||
nt|ady: 10 imps for Hacket on board 9  where 6@H went down 1 in open room|pg||
nt|yo_yo: what?  no agreement? |pg||
nt|yo_yo: anyone protect with the West hand?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|yo_yo: 1NT for me|pg||
nt|lestergold: i borrow a point and protect|pg||
pc|h3|nt|othered1: another possible slam|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|pg||
nt|garnetts: It looks as if Twonsend thinks this shows a hand that would have made a penalty double of 1NT|pg||
nt|yo_yo: some play the double as penalty of a weak NT|pg||
nt|ady: n/s could be in difficulty here if e/w keep doubling|pg||
nt|yo_yo: some play it shows @D|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ady: if east can double showing values  west will surely pass|pg||
pc|hT|nt|othered1: are we into relays?|pg||
nt|sybarra: looks like (again)|pg||
nt|lestergold: extra values but even 5@s is alittle precarious|pg||
pc|h4|nt|garnetts: I prefer the agreement that x is pens after a weak notrump and a suit after a strong/medium notrump |pg||
nt|yo_yo: oooops   true,  no agreement :)|pg||
nt|ady: n/s of the hook|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|lestergold: Small has a sign off now|pg||
nt|lestergold: Small's diamond suit does not like like slam, material|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c9|nt|pelu: where did N find that X???|pg||
nt|pelu: in CR|pg||
nt|blum1956: Against weak NT it is better to play "diamonds or strong, starting from a strong NT"|pg||
pc|c6|nt|garnetts: Some decided to dbl 3NT next door--someone should have redoubled |pg||
nt|ady: 9 tricks look a lot|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|garnetts: This is truely poor bridge from EW--|pg||
nt|yo_yo: there's not better about either, just depends which hand comes along|pg||
nt|ady: might well make on the lead|pg||
nt|yo_yo: however I would have expected a pair of such quality as townsend Bakhshi to have discussed this one|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm...|pg||
nt|lestergold: well time to put brakes on as cards lie 11 tricks ok |pg||

pc|c3|pc|cJ|pc|cK|pg||
nt|lestergold: well kin'sare on|pg||
pc|d6|nt|othered1: Here east may get squeezed in the minors for 6|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d5|nt|garnetts: it should be incumbent upon players wanting to represent their country to have sorted this out |pg||
nt|yo_yo: they are a newish partnership|pg||
nt|ady: Q@H favourable this should make|pg||
nt|blum1956: the strongest part of the weak NT - you make the opponents not to know their HCP's. They often land in 22-23 HCP 3NT. Still you nead to beat that.|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|lestergold: King's were on but Small is still plunging headlong there|pg||
nt|lestergold: very un disciplined in my view|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|lestergold: its a not even good enuf for roland im trying to work out how the cards would have to lie for thsi slam to be makeable|pg||
nt|ralfwil: E must win @cA if S plays a small from dummy|pg||
nt|lestergold: he will know that from the lead|pg||
pc|cT|nt|garnetts: well I am moaning the lead was awful--and South should have doubled |pg||
pc|s2|nt|garnetts: South must double to keep EDW honest and North on track--so he doesn't look elsewhere for a lead like he has |pg||
nt|ady: e/w have useful lower diamond pips|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|yo_yo: I am corrected, Townsend/Bakhshi not a "newish" partner|pg||
nt|yo_yo: a NEW partnership|pg||
nt|blum1956: the game of bridge is not that all for high card points|pg||
nt|garnetts: NS doing well for EW on this hand|pg||
nt|garnetts: it is interesting and instructional to see play like this and where it stems from---North started with a bad lead because he though his side needed to find fast tricks  |pg||
nt|blum1956: West must establish a trick in a minor suit  to discard his 4th heart|pg||
nt|garnetts: If Souht had doubled then his opening lead would have been like ace and another heart |pg||
nt|garnetts: this would also have left dec to get on with it and he would have no chance |pg||
nt|garnetts: Shows that bridge relies upon so many tells -|pg||
nt|blum1956: is he going not to play the @dQ??|pg||
nt|ady: 10@D  would have been killing switch if 9 was with south|pg||
nt|ady: has to cover or will go down|pg||
nt|sybarra: not sure I want to be in 6 on that possibility |pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree Mike, but must still be done|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|othered1: Noa, but on this favorable lie of EW cards, it scores|pg||

pc|dA|nt|othered1: Was 2N for minors?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: yes|pg||
nt|ralfwil: This is a kind of bidding I don´t like. a natural 2@s forcing on an unpassed hand and a 5-card suit for me|pg||

nt|ralfwil: what´s your opinion Mike?|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Also thanks to our excellent commentators, David, Peter, Martin and Hans|pg||

nt|vugraphzda: apologies to the kib asking me about their methods, I'm not certain, and looking over at their card would be distracting to the players|pg||
nt|roswolf: the play is trivial|pg||

nt|garnetts: I would rather be in 6@D than 2@D |pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: i suppose if East double he fears West will lead @S|pg||
nt|blum1956: 5@d looks the best spot. Even 6@d makeable. But East was most unhappy with his overcall. Certainly he was going to rebid|pg||
nt|garnetts: I suppose that West couldn't bid 2@D because it was conventional--personally I would bid 3@D then |pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: decent 3NT for EW here|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 1@S  2@H  ;  2@S  3@D  ;  3@H  3@S  ; 4@S  is a possible auction|pg||

pc|cJ|pc|c9|pc|cA|nt|garnetts: on the last hand the auction in the OR room was odd to say the least--East was unbelievably conservative |pg||
nt|yo_yo: j@S will be welcome|pg||
nt|garnetts: West overcalled 1@C with 1@D and west just bid hearts twice |pg||
nt|yo_yo: NS under a lot of pressure now|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c7|nt|garnetts: Dixon and Silverstone have for years thought three of amjor was a pointless contrcat and simply agreed that it was always forcing |pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@S is the default rebid with an unbalanced minimum hand without 3 hearts, so it did not guarantee six cards|pg||
pc|s2|pc|d7|pg||
nt|garnetts: perhaps he isn't aware of the bonus for making games or slams |pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: Tom asks about carding methods|pg||
pc|cK|nt|panja: in the five card ending with @SAJ and @DAJ3 in E hand, S will have to keep two Spades and 3 Diamonds...then duck a @S to South..and then final endplay|pg||

nt|yo_yo: 20|pg||
nt|roswolf: could be a lot of bidding here|pg||
nt|roswolf: how many spades?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Close to 4|pg||
nt|othered1: That 1N overcall(as opposed to an opening) wouldn't be everyone's cup of tea.  West's great @Slength, however, is a great catch.|pg||
nt|roswolf: a case for 3@S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4 can go down but it may not|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It takes a club ruff to beat 4@S|pg||
nt|roswolf: or 4@S or even 2@S SAY SOME SPECS|pg||
nt|othered1: 4@H isn't hopeless, is it? But they won't get to play there|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Is it obvious that they will find the defence against 4@S?|pg||
nt|lestergold: undoubtedly one of our best card players|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I don't think so|pg||
nt|roswolf: not at all|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ady: did the right thing   5 too high|pg||
nt|lestergold: schooledijn decades of high stake rubber bridge|pg||
nt|ady: e/w can make either 3NT or 5@C  with K@D well placed   but have been kept out of the bidding|pg||
pc|cA|nt|yo_yo: Townsend got it right , as he had with every decision this match|pg||
nt|roswolf: good 2-way shot|pg||

pc|c2|nt|Walddk2: wow|pg||
nt|Walddk2: what a lead|pg||
pc|c3|pc|h2|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4@h cold as cards lie|pg||
nt|lestergold: of course no reason for them to get there|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|roswolf: indeed nick is very very good combines flair with excellent technique|pg||
nt|othered1: One way to get @C ruff, if both N and S read it correctly|pg||
nt|yo_yo: South will be surprised to be undoubled|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h3|nt|garnetts: I think no decision here--must be right to pass--might have been tempted on the South hand except that partner has passed already |pg||
nt|blum1956: I would pass as well - to find 6@h you need a stiff club and this is not enough while 5@h may well go down|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h4|nt|Walddk2: South will|pg||

nt|ralfwil: here is another board where my bidding is different. I can bid 2@h on a hand like Ss|pg||

mb|2C!|mb|p|mb|2D!|an|no 4 major|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: To find the lady, you could: 1) Peek or 2) note that East has only one diamond, and therefore is likely to have more length in hearts than West|pg||
mb|2N!|mb|p|mb|3N!|an|no 5 minor|mb|p|nt|roswolf: ok have kept it!|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Some events start at 9:00|pg||

nt|garnetts: Just been told that Bob Hamman said play the one you hate most for it--but as has been said since he hates almost everyone .............|pg||
nt|henryb:  Only at the table ...|pg||
nt|bjacobs: He might have SAID that, but he would DO it|pg||

nt|garnetts: Of course Henry |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hamman also says that experts play badly, the rest even worse. He is probably right|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I thought you sold your caps key, Geoffrey|pg||
nt|roswolf: places the cards and values|pg||
nt|vugraphzda: Bell asks what North has shown : 5@Ds, 4 card major|pg||
nt|garnetts: He was just shouting at me Roland |pg||
pc|c2|nt|roswolf: i have a new keyboard at work where i was yesterday but at home the old faithful still remains|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I don't think the double of 5@C is at all fatuous.  It's quite likely that partner is on lead to 6@D ... it's quite fair to help him with it|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Of course, it could backfire, but so can any decision|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c8|pc|c5|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Agree, at least it avoids the disastrous heart lead|pg||
nt|garnetts: Dec will use the 3-1 @D break as his main reason for playing east for the Q@H--based on the principal of vacant spaces|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dT|nt|Walddk2: Is that valid if East is long in clubs?|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d2|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm juniors or recent juniors cant sit still|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|c3|pc|d6|pc|d8|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I think the double of 5@C shows strength rather than length|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not sure it shows length in clubs more an honour |pg||

pc|dJ|nt|garnetts: The lead was also the 2 --so no info there really |pg||

nt|bjacobs: He's going to find the exact shape, now ...|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: If no interference it would have been 4+ spades, 3+ hearts, invitational|pg||
nt|roswolf: may well be a push|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But that is obviously not the case here|pg||
nt|ady: needs heart guess|pg||
mb|4C|nt|yo_yo: he denied 4@H so that's a cue bid agreeing @D|pg||

nt|lestergold: now the play is everything!|pg||
pc|c2|nt|yo_yo: now to see our  "immigrant" in action|pg||
nt|ady: with east showing singleton diamond  this is likely to made  heart guess likely |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Results from round 1: Rosen v Senior 25-4 ; Teltscher v P Hackett 19-11 ; Small v Hinden 17-13, and de Botton v Crouch 16-14|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i think he will get it right, will find the singleton !@D and long @C with Bakhshi|pg||
nt|lestergold: if south reads east for club length on the bidding and lead he may find it hard to read the heart however when east shows up with stiff trump he will have a lot of thinki9ng to do|pg||

nt|roswolf: GOOD START|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: After a weak notrump I think dbl is best used to show a hand that would have doubled 1NT |pg||
nt|garnetts: against a medium/strong notrump dbl is best to show the suit for lead reasons |pg||
nt|roswolf: really this shows are wierd alerting rules when you have to alert this kind of double|pg||

mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Is it so easy to reach 4@H here?|pg||
mb|2S|mb|2N|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: No|pg||
nt|bjacobs: West isn't really thinking of game - he might just sign off in 3@H|pg||
nt|henryb:  why? the natural meaning of double is "I can defeat 2@H". When by agreement it means something else ...|pg||
nt|garnetts: not in my view but once East has shown about what he has ---west should bid it |pg||
nt|bjacobs: Still, East has shown a very good hand, I suppose|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's a line ball decision - take away the @DJ and 4@H is almost hopeless|pg||
mb|3D|nt|Walddk2: Bell may not know exactly how strong. However, he can't really afford to stay out of a vulnerable game at IMPs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think he will bid it eventually|pg||
nt|roswolf: i believe that under our rules an unalerted double of a transfer bid SHOWS that suit not power|pg||
nt|vugraphzda: which to be fair is how everyone plays it at club bridge|pg||
nt|garnetts: The rules as usual are daft |pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@D seems dangerous to me|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3@D LOOKS TO BE AN INTENDED TRANSFER WILL EAST RECOGNISE THIS? |pg||
nt|bjacobs: Surely not - either they play transfers or they don't ...|pg||
nt|vugraphzda: I think alerting rules should be for the masses, and most people in the UK would play that dbl shows @Hs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Unless you have a firm agreement on this auction. Not sure how many have|pg||
nt|roswolf: sorry caos lock is getting stuck|pg||
nt|roswolf: caps|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I have a firm agreement ... after someone bids a natural 2NT, system is on ...|pg||
nt|henryb:  My agreement is that after natural 2N bids, all actions are transfers|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We can see that it is a transfer but can Byrne is the question|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Probably should be as West already passed 2@H doubled|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Disaster struck|pg||

pc|h8|nt|garnetts: Roland---the number of times I have seen players make a bid which is dodgy in uncharted waters --I wonder why bother--might just bid 4@H  and have done with it|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h9|pc|hQ|nt|roswolf: this will now be a big morale test for e/w - opps bid and make a thinnish slam now a major bidding mix up- lots of intestinal fortitude required|pg||
mc|7|nt|vugraphzda: some discussion: EW seems quite relaxed|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But if you are going to play serious bridge at a seriously high level, you simply have to know these things, and not be forced into blasting games "just in case"|pg||

mb|p|nt|roswolf: e/w will do well to avoid going minu here|pg||
nt|yo_yo: in the OR Byrne discarded a @S|pg||
mb|1S|mb|d|nt|ady: likely to end in 2NT|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk2: They are playing it now, out of order|pg||
mb|3H|nt|yo_yo: do you agree with that double?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: I use it for the other 2 suits|pg||
nt|ady: 4@H seems to be a make here     3@D -2   a misunderstanding|pg||
nt|lestergold: i see what happened in open is that the inexperienced Byrne discarded a spade and that was enyf for Forrester|pg||
mb|p|mb|4H|mb|p|nt|roswolf: maybe not|pg||
nt|othered1: If that's multi, there are lots of different defenses to it.   Some let  you make a takeout "double" of @H immediately, but west's @S holding might be inadequate|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: this looks -2 for sure|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: no play of course for a push|pg||
nt|lestergold: mybols bridge tip think carefully before discarding form ur useless low tripleton!!|pg||
pc|d5|nt|blum1956: 3@d is much better|pg||

nt|lestergold: road map|pg||
pc|cK|nt|yo_yo: tempting to bid 3NT with the north hand now|pg||
nt|lestergold: twice as many bnids to reach 3N in open room that was the only difference|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|nt|ady: now overboard     unavoidable once North bids 2@D   south can really only raise|pg||

mb|2C!|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3C|an|forcing|nt|henryb:  Interesting question as West: do you Stayman or show an invitational hand with clubs |pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bjacobs: Some might have Staymaned and then bid 3NT|pg||
pc|d6|nt|henryb:  Or a forcing hand with clubs|pg||
nt|roswolf: now 3nt is the spot - and a solid sequence to get there - in the circumstances just what e/w needed|pg||
pc|d8|nt|garnetts: Stayman looks right to me--and if 3@C implies four spades--west has bid it well |pg||

nt|garnetts:  good point has just been made however, if you transfer to clubs you will know if partner has the ace--like/dislike--and 3NT will not be on with no ace opposite most of the time |pg||
