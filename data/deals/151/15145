nt|jbgood: well put David, a less than perfect defense may even allow 3 spades to make|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm a nice freak|pg||
nt|roswolf: practical bidding in the other room|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|vugraphpl2: witamy kibicow|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w were slightly unlucky in the other room|pg||
nt|rv: I agree, if it at all it means something logical, it should be the expn of t/o of @s with max pre-empt (close to opening hand)|pg||
mb|1N|an|4!h 5m|nt|jbgood: may be duplicated|pg||
nt|tomi2: I dont like the double of 3@D, for me it does not show Kjxx, its just for the lead, think one should bid something to committ the partnership to 4th level to show the willing to ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: play 4@H or 5@D|pg||
nt|henryb:  reaching 6@h is well done|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: in other words, it means "i should have opened 1H"|pg||
mb|2C|nt|rv: :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: other major + longer minor?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|roswolf: same start as the other room|pg||
mb|d|an|T/o|nt|roswolf: yes 7@H would however be very unlucky|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: the @C10 might have been a good shot for the defence|pg||
nt|roswolf: even so dont particulary like dbl|pg||
nt|rv: Raptor is not very popular, Sandwitch nt to show other 2 suits after (1x)-(1y) is more popular|pg||
mb|2N|an|!|mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|roswolf: except north bid 3@S rather than 4@C|pg||
nt|brolucius: Not unreasonable for North to bid strongly on his hand, which has potential. 3@S by North at the other table was a bit on the cautious side.|pg||
nt|vugraphzqn: he missbid 3 @c|pg||
nt|vugraphzqn: then he bid 4@c|pg||
nt|roswolf: AAHHH|pg||
nt|rv: I prefer 1n O/C to show 15-18 though I like Sandwitch NT |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: 2nt = enquiry for minor!?|pg||
pc|s6|nt|roswolf: this is tight but can/should go -1|pg||
nt|jbgood: .. and if you want to play 4 @s, you dont give away your hand by bidding 4 @c?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: matchpoint methods, IMHBAICO. i would never give up strong NT overcall at IMPs. variety of approaches is certainly interesting though|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|pc|sJ|pg||
pc|d4|pc|d9|pc|dK|nt|roswolf: very interesting and i agree raptor is a pairs gadget|pg||

nt|marlowepi: so they play that a double of 1S is penalty? even playing gadgets i dont see any call but double on the S gand|pg||

pc|c8|pc|c2|pc|c4|pc|cK|pg||

mb|p|nt|roswolf: north mustnt get too carried away with his points|pg||
nt|brolucius: Krakow is a beautiful mediaeval city, where the restaurants serve a lot of game dishes, such as venison. A great place for a week's holiday.|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|tomi2: do you bid 1@S or 1@H with north hand? and why?|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Good evening to Peter Gill|pg||
nt|roswolf: what was 1nt supposed to be?|pg||
nt|petergill: Hi|pg||
mb|p|pc|c3|nt|marlowepi: to me 3D is hasty -- you might have a heart game. with this shape and nobody bidding spades, it is unlikely opps can outbid you, so go slow. if they bid more clubs, diamonds still ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: rank higher|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cA|nt|jbgood: north is wondering who has the spades . if prd has them, he must be very weak|pg||
nt|henryb:  More to the point, do you make a takeout double of 1@d with South or remain a churchmouse, silent and waiting|pg||
nt|roswolf: i bid 1@H "UP THE LINE"|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|roswolf: fair comment|pg||
nt|rv: I would have bid 2@h on 1@d O/C to show @hs and @ds, fit showing jump|pg||
nt|rv: instead of 3@d by East|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes for me 3@D would show a worthless hand |pg||
pc|sA|pc|s6|nt|roswolf: this should be a cakewalk|pg||
pc|s9|pc|s4|pg||
nt|roswolf: heart suit quality not good enough for me for a fit jump|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sJ|nt|tomi2: dont understand easts pass here. ater not selling out to 1@S and a raise by partner Game should be a good shot|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s5|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sQ|pc|s3|pc|s7|pg||
mc|9|nt|marlowepi: even if it is invitational in their methods i think it is both an underbid and tactically injudicious. |pg||

nt|rv: can't have everything/be too specific Geoff, at 2 level being passed hand and values in 2 suits, I like fit jump a lot|pg||
nt|roswolf: its mainly a matter of philosophy|pg||
mb|1C|an|!|nt|roswolf: can they gei to the grand|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphpl2: dyskusja o poprzednim rozdaniu|pg||
mb|1H|mb|p|nt|jbgood: grands are rarely "easy" ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I like one of the team names in Group U, "She goes to bed at 8"   :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: normally i agree totally Jeff. i think there is a case, though, for loosening the suit-strength criteria when you are a passed hand. i could go either way on that|pg||
mb|2C|nt|petergill: Filipowicz and Martens won Australia's biggest bridge event earlier this year, and I'm told that they also won the Polish Pairs Championship last year. |pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.pzbs.pl/wyniki/turnieje/2010/pula/team/pulateamleaderb.html  for running scores|pg||

nt|marlowepi: Geoff|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: now N is worried that 4C wont be read as forcing|pg||
nt|rv: now North worth 4@c to show fit and extras (I like to play crossing 3n with minor fit shows extras)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: so he may bid 3S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: planning to bid 4C over 3N to reveal intentions|pg||
mb|3S|an|!|mb|p|nt|roswolf: wasnt 2@D setting up a gf|pg||
mb|3N|nt|tomi2: seemy both tables will sell the W hand as strong balanced. I think one could open 1@D|pg||
nt|tomi2: both black suits are stopped but the stops dont run away|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|petergill: Consus is EW's sponsor - a major company in Poland - Consus is involved in emissions trading schemes or something like that|pg||
nt|rv: if North had min he could have passed 3@c even if 2@d was not setting GF, in my book 4@c should be forcing|pg||
nt|roswolf: or not as the case may be|pg||
pc|s3|nt|marlowepi: N apparently worried that 3rd suit forcing does not set up a GF, or else that his pd wont be sure it does, or else that "GF" auctions can still die at 4m|pg||
pc|s4|nt|roswolf: 3NT IS VERY FORTUNATE|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sA|pg||
nt|roswolf: strong with 5 spades apparently|pg||
pc|c2|nt|roswolf: fell short - indeed not as easy as it seems|pg||
nt|petergill: 4NT RKCB should in my opinion be followed by 5NT by South, to let North know that NS has all the keycards and trump queen|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cK|pc|cT|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d8|nt|roswolf: 12 top tricks|pg||
pc|d5|nt|Walddk2: It's on a finesse, not that fortunate|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Must finesse spades to make it|pg||
nt|henryb:  needs the @s finesse. and a little luck in a pointed suit: either 3-3 @s or @d coming home|pg||
nt|jbgood: cllose your eyes and open them again after the spade jack wins:)|pg||
nt|roswolf: but lots off if finesse is wrong|pg||
nt|tomi2: in 5@D you lose two aces but can survive without finesses|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|brolucius: South had the option, presumably, of bidding 5NT after his 4NT. This would tell partner that all the key cards were held and invite him to bid a grand slam. |pg||
pc|dK|nt|petergill: Then North might bid the grand. |pg||
pc|d4|pc|d6|nt|roswolf: whereas 5@D is gin|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|rv: slam auctions become too diff, if both North and South both want to have Inv bids after South has shown min |pg||
pc|hA|nt|marlowepi: and over 3N, N was worried that if he bid on terorists would kill his children. only explanation i can think of for not bidding 4C over 3N|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h5|nt|henryb:  Obviously both 4@h, 4@s and 5@d are all better contracts|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c3|nt|jbgood: i guess they will bid it -- in the post mortem|pg||

pc|c4|pc|hK|pc|hT|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|rv: playing convention of cancelling GF is not good for partnership health in my opinion:)|pg||
mc|12|nt|rv: better to bid 5 and go down occasionally rather than complicating all slam auctions|pg||
pg||

nt|haans: do you agree with 3@C?|pg||
nt|othered1: and only a @D split or unlikely squeeze for 13 tricks|pg||

mb|6C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: well south caught up |pg||
nt|haans: Pintaric just found the second ace :)|pg||

nt|brolucius: South did make a grand slam try at the other table and North accepted. Well bid!|pg||
nt|tomi2: west saw akqxx @D when he opened the bidding|pg||
nt|henryb:  because we are good birds with a birds-eye view|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|roswolf: the other room had no problem - a bow and arrow approach 3-5-6|pg||
mb|2D|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|marlowepi: it is not a question of "cancelling" a GF. there is a case for allowing "strong" auctions to die at 4m, because not every hand that wants to play 3N if a certain suit is stopped ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: would be thriolled to contract for 11 tricks if it isnt|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|petergill: East is one of the world's greatest players. His website is http://www.martensuniversity.com/. |pg||
nt|brolucius: North's 2@H means that he want to go no higher (understandably) if South's major is hearts.|pg||
mb|4H|nt|rv: it essentially means you are cancelling GF:)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dJ|nt|petergill: Martens' books and training are highly recommended - some of his books have been translated into English|pg||
nt|brolucius: South doubles 3@H to tell partner that this is his suit. If he omitted to do this, North might on some auctions bid high in spades, assuming that South held spades.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: a question of wording i guess. you could call it a "conditional game force" too|pg||
nt|roswolf: west probably converted a plus into a minus by bidding 4@H|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|pc|dA|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|nt|brolucius: It seems to me that East's 3@H was a bit risky, since it might have been read as natural (with South's suit not yet known). But West held hearts and did not raise so they clearly ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: knew what they were doing.|pg||
nt|petergill: At least 1100 looks achievable if East can double 2@H for take-out and West converts to penalty|pg||
nt|jbgood: perhaps it would have paid off to double 2 hearts? |pg||
nt|jbgood: unlucky lead|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h8|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h6|nt|brolucius: Perhaps that would have shown hearts?|pg||
nt|petergill: At both tables, the vulnerable penalty was not taken|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h3|pg||
nt|jbgood: even clearer to double by E in the other room...|pg||
nt|petergill: I think 2HX is only 1100 - trump promotion for 1400 is not available, I think|pg||

pc|d4|pc|s3|nt|roswolf: 1100 is never bad|pg||

pc|d8|pc|d7|nt|henryb:  unluckier shift|pg||
pc|d9|pc|c2|pg||
nt|petergill: The top Italians would just overcall 1@H on the grounds that the flat 6322 shape (no singleton nor void) is unsuitable for vulnerable premption. |pg||

nt|roswolf: 4@H maybe?|pg||
nt|roswolf: here definitely strong!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's not necessarily strong. Polish Club 1@C is ... 1. 12-14 balanced (often) - 2. 15+ with clubs - 3. Any 18+ hand|pg||

nt|roswolf: agreed rv|pg||
pc|s2|nt|brolucius: West decides he is not worth anything stronger than 4@H (such as 4@C, splinter) because East limited his hand with the 1@D response.|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|roswolf: and a diamond switch!?|pg||
nt|tomi2: they send two teams to Pula it seems. North is Krzystof Martens, he wrote several books in the past years, if you are an advanced or expert player and want to improve your game, ...|pg||

nt|henryb:  Since E-W make 3@c and can beat 3@s, what's the signicant difference?|pg||
nt|roswolf: DID this really happen?|pg||
nt|rv: East's X ideally should be t/o of @s with max of pre-empt, doesn't make sense to show "I have good and lots of @hs"|pg||
pc|c7|nt|jbgood: and only one down ...|pg||

pc|cQ|pc|s4|nt|brolucius: A lot of difference in the long run, if you do not compete strongly enough. May not matter on this particular deal.|pg||

pc|hA|pc|d9|nt|rv: if that be the case West could have shifted to @c at trick 2, in any case no harm done, decl misguessed @s and went down|pg||

nt|roswolf: i play that double as showing a good wuality suit or a max hand in context|pg||
nt|roswolf: quality|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i am not sure it makes all that much sense even on the reading you suggest -- partner is a passed hand and did not act over 2N -- where are EW going?|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|1N|nt|lestergold: well failure to bid a slam with 12 top tricks does suggest that there may be some error|pg||
mb|d|mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|hT|nt|lestergold: the fault may lie in bidding methods but generally speaking i would feel unhappy if i failed to reach  a 12 top trick nothing to establish slam|pg||
nt|othered1: I guess they don't transfer in this situation.  I agree with that approach.  |pg||

nt|othered1: On the 6@C in OR, I think north's 3@S bid is matchpointy and I think arranging the auction to raise @C would work better.  But in these days of Walsh-type response structure, that ...|pg||
