nt|xenya: double finesse in clubs would have yielded 11 tricks, but it looks a bit risky|pg||

nt|Walddk2: If Pachtman takes a spade finesse, Altshuler must switch to a club, not a diamond|pg||
nt|chick: lots of things could happen if he plays a diamond now and sits back for an endplay|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but would have to try something like leading the @cQ from dummy to try to establish an entry.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 10 tricks he can take, but he can take 11 in 4@H is he guesses everything|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: this will struggle on diamond forces - East's trumps aren't good enough against the 4-1 break|pg||
