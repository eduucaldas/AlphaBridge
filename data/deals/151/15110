nt|kastan88: at once nice hand  for start, NS may win 6c, but how to bid that after opponents 1NT opening?|pg||

nt|sharkey: good morning Mike|pg||
nt|haans: with amurder|pg||
nt|haans: 3@H did the trick|pg||
nt|chick: pretty brave 3N with only Qxx|pg||
pc|c9|nt|lestergold: and to u too Carl|pg||
nt|lestergold: well a tame defence may let this thru|pg||
nt|chick: ouch, and N rescues them|pg||
nt|haans: but ...|pg||
nt|jaheim: hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 3@C of course, partner should have both minors|pg||
nt|pelu: but pass is not an option by N - 2@S?|pg||
nt|frankaus: the scorer is the cheif scorer for the Aust BF  - has done an excelent job|pg||
nt|npcjpn: looks like pass forces redouble.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: greetings everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome Gary|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Hi Gary|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Steve :) great to see you|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sharkey: East elected to bid NV - not unexpected|pg||
nt|lestergold: cant blame south for making the obvious lead|pg||
nt|haans: or not|pg||
pc|cA|nt|haans: 1@D no 5 c M|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello all and welcome.|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: hi all|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Certainly better than this|pg||
nt|pelu: 2@S first time - but now N sh have 10+ |pg||
nt|iceblue: 2@D is woolsey,|pg||
nt|npcjpn: at least NS got the game so far.|pg||
nt|kaz08833: NS reached correct contract|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|lestergold: i must admit that as south i would chance a double here i like to earn imps|pg||
nt|jaheim: NS  won the mixed pair chship this year|pg||
nt|mcarroll: and adopting the trend towards 5 rather than 6 card suit|pg||
nt|jaheim: lots of toppairs playing 2 @D as a weak muli   and 2 @H @S as a serious weak 2|pg||
nt|kastan88: fight for partscore, after club lead and spade switch would be -1, West will getting spade ruff. Now just made.|pg||
nt|iceblue: 1 major|pg||
pc|dA|nt|marlowepi: presumably S cannot open 2H, but a more likely alternative would seem to be 1H. cant argue with success though:)|pg||
nt|chick: Pass by S is also an alternative :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: very odd to bid 4H when 3N is virtually sure to go down|pg||
nt|frankaus: we are too lazy (or drunk) to look to see if the suns out :)|pg||
nt|kastan88: no more troubels for EW,  every partscore (1NT, 2@H doubled) probably -4 for them and -800|pg||
nt|kaz08833: easy 10 tricks, maybe 11|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Korea 11th NZ 10th at this stage|pg||
pc|d6|nt|sharkey: I see 8 tricks?|pg||
nt|lestergold: nom heart ruff but an immediate diamond swirtch and force will be uncomfortabelm fro declarer|pg||
nt|haans: slam possible :)|pg||
nt|april7: very aggressive bid by E|pg||
nt|jaheim: 2 @D   prob   1 major|pg||
nt|april7: @S lead would be good,then down|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 2@H Doubled would have been interesting|pg||
nt|jaheim: ............  and expensive|pg||

nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/2b44yyj  for results and standings before the last round|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@C should lead to a rapid sign-off from East|pg||
nt|rv: I presume Kushari's splinter is limited, Laltu (East's nickname) did have couple of useful cards, but poor @s suit must have decided to lie low|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: would 2@HX be more pleasant for N?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|jaheim: tydligvis en xy nt i sving|pg||
nt|jaheim: ø har vist en invitthånd med 5 + spar|pg||
nt|lestergold: wehn the lord deals you jt9xx of trumps, he meant you to double|pg||
nt|othered1: 25 HCP and stopped at 2@S.  East's psyche had something to do with it.|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Velkommen tilbake|pg||
nt|haans: why 4@H?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Mercifully undoubled|pg||
nt|pelu: even after pass in 1. seat N sh have an A more!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Nobu, please tell us about the Japanese ladies. Have they been regulars in the team for long?|pg||
nt|npcjpn: This EW pair has been played together for a long time.|pg||

nt|iceblue: vs str 1NT, 2@D is ok for me,|pg||
nt|bucheister: no good lead by N she might try a heart; certainly a spadewill not beat this|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: this should be beaten a trick, unless something odd happens|pg||
pc|d2|nt|haans: i prefer 1@H to 3|pg||
nt|chick: with 2 aces and 3 hearts, N must know that 3N is doomed.   must be he thought 4@H was makeable|pg||
nt|haans: true|pg||
nt|marlowepi: in that case why wouldnt he bid it on the porevious round?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: surely E was not going to pass 3HX|pg||
nt|frankaus: fairly transparent singleton lead |pg||
nt|rv: He will hop with @DA, pitch @c on @CK, draw trumps and concede a @d|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: in fact by 2, if def get club ruff|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes and 3@D makes easily|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|haans: Results?|pg||
nt|chick: 3@HX is better than 4@H|pg||

pc|h9|nt|npcjpn: In open room, South did not enter, so 1NT was the contract.|pg||
pc|h5|nt|Walddk4: Jan Arne, Carl og vores operatør, Liv-Marit|pg||
nt|lestergold: if they find the doubhkle in the other room you are in for a massive loss |pg||
nt|jaheim: and  bronze medals  in the mixed team |pg||
nt|haans: other matches?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/2b44yyj  for results and standings after round 4|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and Mike Graham|pg||
nt|april7: loks like only 1 down because of stiff Q of @S|pg||
nt|bucheister: at favorable vul I like 3S and many experts would open 3S even at NV|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: away goes the ruff|pg||
pc|h4|nt|sharkey: Needed a @H lead from S - hardly to be expected I think|pg||
nt|haans: but may make Jt9 in @D = good|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Good morning all|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Indeed. The system I tend to use is that the Double of 2@D indicates that I was going to transfer to @Hs|pg||
nt|jaheim: EW  currently 2.   NS 4. place|pg||
nt|mcarroll: S thinking, 2 shows an honour, so it has to be either A or Ten, |pg||
pc|hK|nt|vugraphznb: EW are brothers|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this contract does not look to be in danger|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/2b44yyj  for results and standings after round 10 of 14|pg||
nt|jaheim: hi   BOA|pg||
nt|kastan88: still down, needed to play 1st trumps|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: well, defence have now missed their opportunity for that ruff|pg||
pc|h7|nt|lestergold: the play for a ruff iss too slow and north has no entry now to play diamonds so this will make after all|pg||
nt|jaheim: 1. of all    tks to our exelent operator Liv Marit Grude,    and congrat.   with silver medal in the Junior ( baby?)  chship|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|npcjpn: The other pair in open room is relatively new partnership.|pg||
nt|frankaus: we can also see the result fron each board from every table|pg||
pc|s6|nt|marlowepi: certainly true that Pass is an option for S. my comment about 1H was based on the manifest intention of S to do something other than the textbook pass, so i whould have prefaced my ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: remark with "given that S wanted to be active here...,"|pg||
nt|jaheim: :)|pg||

nt|iceblue: hi Ed|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, everyone, from a warm late central Pennsylvania|pg||
mb|p|nt|kastan88: so good result for taipei +130 against possible -50|pg||
nt|h_karluk: MI, PA and SC what a combination :)|pg||
nt|bucheister: Michigan is a killer and our a?C went out; hot|pg||
nt|iceblue: wang mb open 1NT, i bet|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: this should end up in 3NT by EW|pg||
mb|1C|nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/2b44yyj  for results and standings after round 3|pg||
nt|marlowepi: certainly there are hands where 3N could make and 4HX be a good save -- mostly they start with a longish minor lacking only the ace plus two heart stoppers and enough spade tricks ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: to get to nine. but it is extremely pessimistic to save since there are zillions of hands where 3N fails, maybe by several tricks. so if you don;t try for that kind of good result ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: when your preempt creates the opportunity, you ought to stop  preempoting|pg||
nt|davidstern: Irashaimase Nobu|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i doubt, why not @c, but may mean different in their sys|pg||
nt|iceblue: 1@D is another choice|pg||
mb|1H|nt|sharkey: vi ligger litt foran :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: Yes - problem was S was on lead - likely to favor declarer|pg||
nt|haans: we will not get abid fron West|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Sorry, missed a few rounds as I had to get the phone|pg||
nt|april7: might end up in 4@S by NS or 5@H by EW|pg||
nt|npcjpn: but only 3 teams in womens, Australia, New Zealand and Japan.|pg||
nt|frankaus: do we open as south ?|pg||
nt|iceblue: they are playing prec|pg||
nt|h_karluk: what's 1@c range?|pg||
nt|kaz08833: neither sids has game but it's likely some kind of disasters may happen on this one|pg||
nt|kastan88: depending of course, that strong hand playing 2@H, but not easy to reach there|pg||
mb|d|nt|haans: or will we?|pg||
nt|haans: assume X is penalty|pg||
nt|haans: weak openings make it harder for opps to bid their cards|pg||
nt|frankaus: we are resorting to betting on two flies here - no-one knows how to rigg that contest|pg||
nt|rv: 3rd pre-empts are GOK, can be very weak to near opening hand esp at this vul|pg||
nt|xenya: i would|pg||
nt|frankaus: Y for me|pg||
nt|othered1: NS playing Precision, I presume?|pg||
nt|iceblue: too poor suit for 2@C|pg||

nt|kastan88: last was about previous board, of course|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: NS in trouble now|pg||
nt|npcjpn: brave 4NT oppsite passed partner.|pg||
nt|kaz08833: because of 1st success N might be too high.. 4NT is a little bit overbid|pg||
mb|2S|nt|kastan88: me too, always|pg||
nt|xenya: why not|pg||
nt|iceblue: yes, prec with 14-16 1NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: but alerted|pg||
nt|mcarroll: May have lost the @S suit now|pg||
nt|jaheim: so the winner of this match will win the tournament|pg||
nt|npcjpn: Quite impressive!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Do they play an invitational sequence after the 1NT rebid I wonder|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Seems like it|pg||
nt|dslee: NS should collect|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I'll bet this double isn't penalty, though|pg||
nt|coolvijay: 5@d on the cards on the finesse of @d q|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: minors or 2 suiter|pg||
mb|3S|nt|sharkey: 3@C nå fra N?|pg||
nt|jaheim: to trekte runder av 7 spill først,   så nr 1 mot 2   osv    en rundes forsinkelse|pg||
nt|jaheim: results afer 2. round   http://bridgefestival.no/modules.php?name=NukeWrap&page=http://nbfdata.bridge.no/Turnering/default.asp?Fil=Festival2010monlag|pg||
nt|lestergold: i dont really understand the defence the play for the ruff wsd pstently hopeless when a forcing game had obviousn prospects|pg||
nt|sharkey: Kib points out @D9 a better lead with actual holding|pg||
nt|lestergold: coffee break hand 4 easy peasy @h|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good morning to Ed Shapiro|pg||
nt|davidstern: He was the third from the right|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 2@C forcing 2@D, then 3@S? Invitational with 6|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Probably not since East is thinking|pg||
nt|dslee: 3@H now|pg||
nt|xenya: more interestingly, do we overcall as W?|pg||
nt|othered1: 41S is really pushy, since almost nobody requires extras for a 1@S free bid nowadays|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Good morning, everybody, from overcast central Pennsylvania, USA|pg||
nt|jaheim: D  is prob  3 @H|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: lol|pg||
nt|mdgraham: bet it shows 13 cards, some of them pictures|pg||
nt|rv: NS not sure of their agreements here possibly, I presume North took South's X as responsive|pg||
nt|dslee: the hint N has to take is that his ptr might not have a 4 card M|pg||
nt|rv: in modern expert methods, I presume South should pass and collect undoubled if North can't double again|pg||
mb|4S|nt|sharkey: S ikely to try the 10 here |pg||
nt|haans: good bidding |pg||
nt|mcarroll: Tricky contract|pg||
nt|davidstern: 4@S is a little unlucky oonb this hand with two diamond ruffs and the spade offside|pg||
nt|mdgraham: one possibility was to start with 2@H over 2@D, but you can understand the double  |pg||
nt|kaz08833: 5@c will go down, probably 2|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: which should come home with 3S, 3D, a heart and 2 clubs, even if defence find best start of a heart|pg||
mb|5H|nt|jaheim: evt   2 nt|pg||
nt|sharkey: Det var vel alternativet|pg||
nt|jaheim: valgte kløvern, hadde fortjent å finne makker med omvendt minorfarger   imo|pg||
nt|sharkey: God strategi å sette press på motstanderne i gunstig sone|pg||
nt|jaheim: 2 @H  prob  shoving 3 + @H|pg||
nt|april7: best is to cash 2 top @D and then playing @C ace and @C|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: 3@H should make on the nose|pg||
nt|davidstern: 3@H last making spot|pg||
nt|frankaus: real tough to find the right strain and level on this 1|pg||
nt|dslee: 2@H is better bid from N|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and now NS are swinging across the line|pg||
nt|rv: I will fault South's double here more than North's first double|pg||
nt|mdgraham: to be fair, this is a very awkward hand for NS|pg||
nt|frankaus: my choice would bre 3NT after the X by N|pg||
nt|bucheister: E has to bid 5H|pg||
nt|h_karluk: it sounds modified prec there|pg||
nt|othered1: Yes, east can't presume a canape overcall . . . |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: which they didn't|pg||
mb|d|nt|haans: :(|pg||
nt|haans: if they make 1NTx they do not get game |pg||
nt|chick: 4@H looks good superficially, but I think difficult to make.  3@S has no chance.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: we can see that spade intervention might make this tricky, but the chance for that has gone|pg||
nt|kastan88: with trump lead just lot of down|pg||
nt|kaz08833: S is an expert dummy player and he might take 10 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: technically 4@s is a vbiablem save but who is gonna bid it it could be heading for 800 not agood imnvestment unless you cansee al the cards|pg||
nt|jaheim: S is prob. very tired,  a "old"  (59)  lady playing every day since last friday|pg||
nt|sharkey: hi everyone|pg||
nt|chick: Hi Carl|pg||
nt|pelu: u were right with 3@s :)|pg||
nt|rv: South should either pass (my choice) or bid 3n|pg||
nt|mdgraham: looks like they will get to 4@H|pg||
nt|frankaus: when in doubt ........... bid 3NT ......... Hamman|pg||
nt|iceblue: @C lead would set it|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: hi Cornelia|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Interesting lead. With no entry to the @Ss and with a limited auction, trying to find partners strength|pg||
nt|rnmalik: indeed. @SJ would have been interesting.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Absolutely|pg||
nt|baardolav: should make even if all the "quesses" goes wrong|pg||
nt|april7: S has to play Q of @H or small @H from dummy to make this contract,because S will not guess stiff K of @C|pg||

nt|Walddk4: This is basically the same|pg||
nt|Walddk4: The hands fit nicxely and game is easy|pg||
nt|super nova: Some people like to play 8 ever 9 never|pg||
nt|bucheister: I am not sure; but we will find out|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Da burde vel ikke Pd ha x første gang?|pg||
nt|henryb:  I would love to know how East made 6N|pg||
nt|haans: Hi Ed|pg||
nt|henryb:  Hello Hans, Ed|pg||
nt|haans: Hi Henry|pg||
nt|baardolav: 3@s is a better bid than 3@h|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Well, maybe not easy|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.pabf2010.co.nz/Participants/Convention-Cards/Women/Japan.aspx|pg||
nt|super nova: hence not to take the @d finesse|pg||
nt|frankaus: a "round" 12 is not everybody's idea to open - but A + 2K  hard to pass |pg||
pc|s9|nt|haans: kib: GRASSHOPI: I'd have preferred X to 3@D me: and then what|pg||
nt|npcjpn: even @HQ wasted, I am surprised Asbi's pass over 2@s.|pg||
nt|iceblue: She got it|pg||
nt|kastan88: after such bidding, sure, needed trump lead|pg||
pc|s3|nt|frankaus: this has a play IMO|pg||
nt|mdgraham: credit the 2@D opening with making NS work|pg||
nt|h_karluk: mainly there are 5 opening bids in the precision system : 1@c 18+, 1@d 10+, 1@h 10+ w 5cm @h, 11s same, 1N 15-17 (th important point dont bid if u ve 14-18)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mdgraham: looks like they are getitng there.|pg||
nt|frankaus: c!Q well placed|pg||
nt|frankaus: @CQ|pg||
nt|rv: this contract can make since @CQ well placed and both @hs and @cs breaking|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: bd 1 an exact push|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|coolvijay: true|pg||
nt|super nova: however when a 6 card spade suit is shown the odds tend to favor the fineese so |pg||
nt|super nova: should make in theory.|pg||
pc|h7|nt|othered1: easy plus for NS, even though you might score a bit more in @S|pg||
nt|chick: perhaps, but I don't like to bid a weak 2 in first seat with such a nice major holding spades here|pg||
nt|pelu: I see a loser in 4 suits :)|pg||
pc|hA|nt|haans: no not a perfect |pg||
nt|othered1: For my style, the @D suit is two higher honors short.|pg||
nt|chick: especially diamonds, which rarely has much preempt value|pg||
nt|h_karluk: do i remember right Ice?|pg||
pc|h6|nt|sharkey: Looks like Mr. Voll has lots of work to do here|pg||

pc|c2|nt|haans: assume he played well :)|pg||
nt|haans: on target|pg||
nt|chick: bingo|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Interesting, N will probably play J @Cs to try to get an entry to dummy, if W ducks may be held to 8|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ok modified variants|pg||
nt|npcjpn: on this hand, 4NT worked poorly, but if partner holds East hand...|pg||
pc|c5|nt|lestergold: old lady! excuse my wife is 59 in a few weeks and she is still in first flush of youth|pg||
pc|cA|nt|chick: N could have safely led a heart at trick 2, and saved one club ruff, but S is doing it for him|pg||

pc|c4|nt|npcjpn: without @HQ, it is possible.|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|haans: weak opening made NS hard to bid|pg||

nt|kaz08833: the contract will be 3@d by NS|pg||

mb|4S|nt|othered1: @C systems handle east's hand easily.  But if you're willing to open the correct 1@D, standard shouldn't have a huge problem, either.|pg||

nt|jaheim: 4 @D from Aabye ?|pg||
nt|april7: now 1NT pass pass pass |pg||
nt|davidstern: Not a fan of the pass by W - I would prefer to bid 2@C to let partner know I have values else I will be under pressure later|pg||
nt|rv: I presume Kushari-Laltu play 1n here to show 16-18, hence Laltu Xed instead of 1@s on account of much better @c suit |pg||
nt|mdgraham: there is a school of thought that 1N sandwich should simply be a strong NT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: given the dross people open and respond on these days |pg||

nt|chick: it looked same to me, but we trust our operator :)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: E hates this hand!!|pg||
nt|davidstern: We likely have 50% + of the points and partner doesnt know it|pg||
nt|davidstern: 2@D by E???|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: will be by S|pg||
nt|pelu: oh - I didn't exp that|pg||
nt|rv: he should pass here, not enough to bid once more esp with some short suit values|pg||
nt|frankaus: red card will apper now|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: but west has a monster over east's bidding so should go on|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh well im really getti9ng a full dose of commentatr's curse today|pg||

nt|mdgraham: East might bid agin, but if he has bid his hand with double then he has a clear pass chez moi|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hi all|pg||
nt|h_karluk: would u x as E Ed?|pg||
nt|kaz08833: 3@s is very ill judge|pg||
nt|kastan88: why not 3@S from west?, or even 4s?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jaheim: K of cl and a claim?|pg||
nt|haans: Big Club at its best|pg||
nt|baardolav: this will make +2 or something|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if 2@d is a Multi, South can respond 2@h (pass/correct) or 2@S (pass/3@h). His hearts are good, could easily have bid 2@s   |pg||
nt|mdgraham: South with long hearts assumes his partner has spades :)|pg||
nt|baardolav: 2@s is natural not forcing in weak multi|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you can play it that way.|pg||
nt|npcjpn: wow! pass with void?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: At least they can take it 1 down|pg||
nt|iceblue: N misunderstood the DBL|pg||
nt|pelu: looks like NS is not so experient|pg||
nt|mdgraham: now 3@D from West?|pg||
pc|d3|nt|lestergold: headed for game not making perhaps|pg||
nt|chick: this can make 4@H but not 5@C|pg||
nt|rnmalik: lesser evil and pass by E.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Pas probably limits the damage as any EW contract would be pretty expensive|pg||
nt|mcarroll: @S slam can make, but unlikely to be bid|pg||
nt|mcarroll: an aggressive lead which on this layout costs a trick|pg||
nt|rv: yes I agree Laltu should have 2 shown suits with more shape earlier with sandwitch NT or Mich or pass now|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 3@S seems a perfect making spot|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: no idea why South bothered to remove 1NT to 2D ..her hand looks "no-trumpy" to me|pg||
pc|d6|nt|haans: i have stopped bidding 4@H 30 years ago|pg||
nt|haans: support x better than delayed support|pg||
nt|npcjpn: may be great score in matchpoint.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: oh, North|pg||
nt|frankaus: saved|pg||
nt|iceblue: anyone agree with this DBL?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: not |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 4 makes on the trump hook|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: nor the choice of lead|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|lestergold: i would bid something - choice between 4n and 5H not easy but i would fera missing slam to much not to make a try|pg||
nt|sharkey: @CJ Jan Arne - and claim :)|pg||
nt|othered1: I personally prefer to use a 2@C rebid after 1@D opening to show a good hand. Gives you room to explore below 3N, at a cost on some natural auctions on lesser hands.|pg||
nt|chick: wow, I would never sell out with S's hand|pg||
nt|sharkey: shud be off 1|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello Hamdi  welcome |pg||
nt|h_karluk: all natural and i think 2@s would be a wise choice|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Hi Shirley , thanks|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: and while 2@S will play ok here, if it got a hideous trump break it would be way off|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jaheim: mm  |pg||
nt|Walddk4: But 100 is not much compensation for a missed game|pg||
nt|mdgraham: how can double be anything but penalty?|pg||
nt|frankaus: N cant beleive pd pass a penn X with 3@S|pg||
pc|c2|nt|h_karluk: the difference now is @d4/3 but @s 5/2|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but i wld choose x as east with passed hand's 11 fine|pg||
nt|kaz08833: watching all hands we know EW can make even 4@s but I will surely pass 3@D with E's hand and gain small plus|pg||
pc|d4|nt|sharkey: Ø spiller @SK først - ofte "æerlig" fordeling da|pg||
nt|haans: was strong in KS|pg||
nt|haans: 2@C|pg||
nt|othered1: That's my preferred natural system :)|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|haans: @H lead much better than low spade|pg||
nt|npcjpn: dbl by West show @H and some @s?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But can they make 5@C?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: would u also pass as East Ice?|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|jaheim: mm   5 @D  -1|pg||
nt|lestergold: 5@d can lose spade heart and @d 3n very vulnerable too|pg||
nt|sharkey: Agree - think he shud fight with 3@H|pg||
nt|april7: depends on the play,W might lose 1 @S,1@H 2@D and 1 @C|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 5@D I mean|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I wonder if South put the spades down first....|pg||
nt|iceblue: yes, i would pass, since of RED :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: then most probably 1@h allowed, maybe same thing yr p wld think even with less hcp and 1@h would buy|pg||
nt|iceblue: how about 2@D xx?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: double part score = +6 Japan its teams|pg||
nt|kaz08833: this is a kind of "alarm clock".. if S had stiff @h S shd play @DA at trick one|pg||
nt|kaz08833: playing @DK denies stiff @H|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Macau I mean|pg||
nt|kastan88: after 1@S overcall and inviting 2@D (spade support) from East, I think EW never stopping before 3@S (if opps fighting with 3@D), but sure such decision is problem of style|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 7 imps thx Tommy|pg||
pc|cK|nt|frankaus: they have agreed @H so X cant be t/o|pg||
pc|c6|nt|jaheim: ja   og ender opp med 2 bet |pg||
nt|h_karluk: sounds a desire to play there, a tad ambitious|pg||
pc|d9|nt|npcjpn: on a club guess, I think.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: such things are good enough to save the say whenever there's a misfit and not big points|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|lestergold: perfectly reasonable as games make on dim finesse|pg||
nt|jaheim: needs a sp lead to win, i think|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3n can make dpending on defence 5@d no play at all|pg||
nt|lestergold: except on spade lead|pg||
nt|rv: N-S not clear about their competitive methods, clearly evident from first 2 deals|pg||
nt|h_karluk: sorry, i meant to save the day|pg||
nt|sybarra: welcome to John Bucheister |pg||
nt|bucheister: hi:  I am John Buchheister from the USA;, Michigan to be precise|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Hello John|pg||
nt|h_karluk: greetings from SC to MI, i hope printed yr state well|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|haans: :(|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Would you x NT after first x by W and pass by E?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: W showed the other two suits by x.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I think I would find the Pass, but I also think being aggressive is a winner in the long term|pg||
pc|cT|nt|lestergold: very little info from auction west has opted for non commital 'safe' trump lead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: however, they have also stopped at the two-level, so double is not needed as any sort of competitive effort|pg||
pc|s4|pc|c8|pg||
nt|lestergold: spade switch obvious but doesnt matter spade loser cannot go|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mcarroll: AKx trumps lead would have made this a struggle for declarer|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: mm make 5 now|pg||
pc|h2|nt|davidstern: Four rounfs of hearts would have been best|pg||
nt|othered1: Meanwhile, 2@H is going to play nicely.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|othered1: At least it simplified the auction.  In standard, south's planned rebid after opening 1@D isn't easy.|pg||
nt|april7: @H switch might cause  aproblem|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|jaheim: minst|pg||
pc|h4|nt|baardolav: you have to... else you will sit on 5-1 heart playing with 7-2 in spade|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good morning to Cornelia Yoder|pg||
nt|chick: Hello Everyone :)|pg||
nt|jaheim: HI|pg||
pc|hK|nt|jaheim: ø i store problemer på neste hj|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and when you have vulnerable opps by the short and curlies (so to speak), you want to twist them  |pg||
pc|h7|nt|haans: biggest problem with 4@H is that you need 10 tricks|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi Cornelia|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
pc|hT|nt|sharkey: Skvisen kommer|pg||
nt|frankaus: turned a large plus into a wash |pg||
nt|Walddk4: This is the last match today. Tomorrow we have Sri Lanka v China, New Zealand v Chinese Taipei, and Singapore v Australia, all from the open series|pg||
pc|d5|nt|kastan88: while bidding seems game on 4-3 hearts fit quite possible, but bad trump break just finishes that dream|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: NZ-CT that should be a cracker|pg||
pc|d2|nt|haans: holy ...|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Declare has 6 tricks and now setting up the 7th|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 3@S was meant as values with no good bid and that is what I think it should be|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|sharkey: fremdeles 2 bet|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|rv: huge let-off for India here, couple of free-hits missed by SL:)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Lead of 10 of @C by N would have been interesting. |pg||
pc|s2|nt|haans: nothing wrong with playing simple|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: yeah, C-T currently right up near the top|pg||
pc|s3|nt|marlowepi: did S really rebid the diamonds all on his own?|pg||
nt|npcjpn: no @c discard?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Shui was not on that wavelength|pg||
nt|dslee: sorry folks back again|pg||
pc|h9|pg||

nt|chick: http://bridgefestival.no/modules.php?name=NukeWrap&page=http://bridgefestival.no/refresh.htm|pg||
nt|chick: not sure which table it is|pg||
nt|april7: 10 of @H was important|pg||
nt|xenya: 4@H turned out to be an unlucky choice it seems -- don't think 4@S EW is likely to make|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|nt|haans: urkkkkkkkkkk|pg||
pc|s5|nt|othered1: If trumps had split less well, it would be playing a lot less nicely.|pg||
nt|bucheister: 2D doubled must have been systemic and I cannot understand the bid by S; EW had no where to go and no where to hide|pg||
nt|kastan88: Yamada-san, sure right, East cant bid more by LOTT, really, he had shown all|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|jaheim: hm   no sidebets,  not even a beer in Lillehammer next year  :)|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s9|nt|sybarra: this is not an easy hand to play in 4/3 |pg||
nt|h_karluk: yes, the auction went natural and somehow W neglected to pick 5/2 @s|pg||
pc|sK|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i believe E did his best to describe the hand|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: plus for NZ here|pg||
mc|10|nt|kiwi_joker: having missguessed what to do on the spade exit by Susan H, decl now in big trouble. EW would have liked their opps to be vully here  :)|pg||

nt|peachy: maybe midway the hand, he could no longer cope if trumps were 4-1 so he should have played for them to be split|pg||
mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1D|mb|d|nt|peachy: I think we can now conclude that both pairs play Precision or Strong Club|pg||

nt|jaheim: skulle tatt sine 6 toppstikk|pg||
nt|sharkey: Ja - mye lettere etterpå:)|pg||
nt|lestergold: my partner is not showing a weak hand in that auction|pg||
nt|jaheim: how many spades in W ?   prob 1|pg||
nt|lestergold: no game here for anyone|pg||
nt|haans: no simple enough|pg||

nt|haans: @SJ|pg||
nt|haans: or played spades|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: open room|pg||
nt|jaheim: wow  sidebet from our operator   Thank you   Liv Marit  :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: How to gain 2 IMPs|pg||
nt|dslee: ahh|pg||
nt|frankaus: peter hall's book competative bidding at pairs has an excellent chapter on competative doubles - i highly recomend it|pg||
nt|bucheister: are they playing a club system?|pg||
nt|sybarra: I do not think so |pg||
nt|h_karluk: i am not sure, just joined and 1st time working abt their teams, but i guess after a few boards we'll reach the truth|pg||
nt|super nova: 6-5 keep it alive.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Slam time.|pg||
nt|othered1: South's pass, at least as I play it, would have been accepting 2@DXX.  That could be tense|pg||
mb|1C|nt|vugraphznb: weak multi or strong|pg||
nt|haans: Voll right thats a weak 2|pg||
nt|chick: we all know better than to bet with you, Jan :)|pg||
nt|jaheim: :)|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: I prefer 2@S (spades and a minor, 6-10) to 1@S,here, but it is close, very close|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: may keep NS out of the cold @D slam|pg||
nt|april7: just 11 tricks possible, but depends on the lead and continuation|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 4@S with 10 or 11 tricks depending on the lead|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 11 on a diamond lead|pg||
nt|frankaus: takes the guesswork out of these situation|pg||
nt|bucheister: the meckwell two heart response is very useful on this type of hand|pg||
nt|rnmalik: What do we have from E, 2@H?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: coffee hand :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Depends on what x of 2@D would mean|pg||
nt|jaheim: 1 nt 4 minors|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: 1NT is 8-15 p and at least 4-4 in @c and @d|pg||
nt|april7: do they play strong pass?|pg||
nt|rv: Click http://www.bridgeunlimited.com/bridge/DisplayResultsT4?club_event_id=15508&header=pabf&fdc=EWDPRAUDG for latest results|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Gary Hanna|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: greetings all|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello Gary, pleasant.|pg||
nt|super nova: Hello|pg||
nt|bucheister: that is right ED and very tense for EW|pg||
nt|kaz08833: LOTT tells E not to bid at 3-level but his @C holding breaks LOTT rules, thats why I dont blame 3@S by E|pg||
nt|kastan88: but brave wolf's breast is fat|pg||
mb|1D|nt|othered1: EW will find 4@S|pg||
nt|sybarra: there are 15 teams participating in the event|pg||
mb|d|nt|lestergold: well this slam wont be missed thats for sure|pg||
nt|othered1: South's double is interesting with that shape and not that many high cards|pg||
nt|haans: odd take out x|pg||
nt|henryb:  Going back to board one, where Lunna mysteriously took 12 tricks in 6N, shouldn't it be possible for big club players to reach 6@c?|pg||
nt|othered1: North has to act h ere and EW may find themselves defending a high @D contract|pg||
nt|haans: big clubs does anything :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: in board 1, Lunna got a diamond in the lead, and South was endplayed in spade|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I suppose it depends on what you open 2@d on - if you can do it with 5@h, then yes, 2@S natural makes sense |pg||
nt|davidstern: Spade partial ERW and Hearts or clubs NS|pg||
nt|pelu: I would never open in East - would u?|pg||
nt|sybarra: Singapore currently in 6th place|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: Kvarngraven 1st to think were are all the cards|pg||
nt|sybarra: at +17 imps|pg||
nt|h_karluk: http://www.bridgeguys.com/Conventions/MeckWellEscapes.html|pg||
nt|sybarra: Palestine, with -53 imps, is in 13th place, but there are several segments remaining and opportunities for plenty of movement in the standings|pg||
mb|1S|nt|jaheim: ja   hadde gått 2 bet jeg|pg||
nt|jaheim: minst  :)|pg||
nt|jaheim: another slam coming up|pg||
nt|sharkey: 18-19|pg||
nt|lestergold: whether they bid the grand tho is open to question|pg||
nt|othered1: I might rebid @H on south's hand and I think it wins over the long term.|pg||
nt|haans: with u|pg||
nt|marlowepi: some would use stayman as N|pg||
nt|april7: should S open and N passes then E will come in in @H and then  perhaps 1,2,3 NT???|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Obviously the dealing machine is saving the games and slams for later in the tournament ...|pg||
nt|davidstern: Spade lead and heart off dummy would work well for declarer|pg||
nt|Walddk4: No|pg||
nt|pelu: give up: 4@s|pg||
nt|rv: E-W pair play rebid of 2M after 2/1 to be catch-all|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2NT forcing - very sensible|pg||
nt|rv: they play 2/1 as GF|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: thx Rashed my friend and Hi Jamie :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: wanghong should pass to 2@h, whatever vulnerability she see|pg||
nt|npcjpn: not coffee hand, depends on a club guess.|pg||
mb|2D|nt|lestergold: hm that will tend to ruole out a heart contract|pg||
nt|sharkey: Kib asked why not open weak 2@H with S hand on Bd 17.  Reason is weak 2 openings 3rd hand NV can be very weak at Expert level, and this was closer to an opening hand.  Also a ...|pg||
nt|sharkey: matter of agreement|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Ah this may get them to the bad game|pg||
mb|2S|nt|sharkey: tror de fleste av oss hadde det|pg||
nt|jaheim: Viego in trbl,  but 1400 in the "bank"|pg||
nt|Walddk4: If you open with a sub-minimum in 3rd seat, fair enough, at least have a decent suit|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I dont know, but thought with 2@H bid by E, EW would be in 6@S.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i mean 2@d xx|pg||
mb|3D|nt|jaheim: NS are playing in my local club|pg||
nt|lestergold: anymore and someone will be in tgrouble|pg||
nt|haans: ty Liv needed that info|pg||
nt|henryb:  Did South really have to act over 1@s Hans?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think many of us would begin with 1@D as W dealer|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: 7@C makes|pg||
nt|chick: I think that hand is much too strong for a preempt|pg||
nt|mdgraham: dbl looks like DONT  - six card suit somewhere. Bit thin if it is|pg||
nt|npcjpn: there are many players who does not like pass in 3rd seat even vulnerable (in Japan).|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: I don't think W should pass 1@D, has 5 P!!! and then 4@H would have been reached making 5 if starts with @S finesse but 10 tricks for sure|pg||
nt|april7: down from top on @S lead|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I would rather open 1@H if you forced me to open|pg||
nt|npcjpn: me too.|pg||
nt|pelu: pest and colera :)|pg||
nt|kastan88: it's possible to win 6@D on EW-line, another is to bid that, and sure, need to find good break in trumps and right finesse in spades, too much key-cards off to bid that|pg||
nt|super nova: I dont like to bid micheals with 'intermediate' hands. because they can be hard to describe.|pg||
nt|kaz08833: or depends on defense.. the problem is when EW find @D shift|pg||
mb|3S|nt|sharkey: Gjetter spillet går ut|pg||
nt|haans: nope|pg||
nt|chick: If I get support for either suit, I don't play a 6-5 hand below game|pg||
nt|bucheister: 4H seems to be an impatient bid; don't you agree?|pg||
nt|bucheister: prbably take 8 tricks on defense|pg||
nt|h_karluk: it wld b a nightmare for EW|pg||
nt|iceblue: sun bids 4@S directly after 2NT better|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: 7N has 13 tops |pg||
nt|lestergold: n /s in trouble !|pg||
nt|haans: to good effect|pg||
nt|pelu: can West pass?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: one of the legacies of the old Acol system was that 2NT here was not forcing|pg||
nt|rv: Kushari will sign-off in 3N to limit hand|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/25udavr  for running scores |pg||
nt|sybarra: seems so John |pg||
nt|h_karluk: absolutely, even i can tell misunderstanding of fast arrival concept|pg||
nt|bucheister: if E bids 2D, W will bid 3D and E can bid 3NT|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i guess A count, K attitude there|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so the defenders would have no difficulty to cash 2@d, 1@c and a trump|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but let's wait and see, who knows there may be a slip in defense|pg||
mb|p|nt|frankaus: scoring looks to be done by martin wilcox cheif scorer for ABF |pg||
nt|dslee: now laltu might force a round?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaheim: y   but no D   |pg||
nt|mdgraham: ok, we don't want 1100|pg||
nt|baardolav: no one can ask for aces...|pg||
nt|pelu: plauge or colera, sorry :)|pg||
nt|pelu: plague - new keyboard :(:(|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this was because when someone opened the bidding, you could never be certain that they had an opening bid|pg||
nt|super nova: I like to stick with Weak or Strong Micheal and bid the medium hands naturally.|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|jaheim: her måtte sp K ut|pg||
nt|jaheim: y   13 toptricks,  with 2 sptricks|pg||
nt|haans: dirty bridge|pg||
nt|bucheister: made us all wonder?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|mcarroll: I tend to agree|pg||
nt|rv: Laltu's 4N is Quant|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh my,  made 4 in other room |pg||
nt|h_karluk: unfortunately true|pg||
nt|sybarra: south cashed a @D, then led a hts |pg||
nt|h_karluk: why i do not have such defenders, i think i am a jealous guy :)|pg||
nt|iceblue: @DQ is the killing lead|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so far so good layout|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and the lead friendly neighbor, no worries|pg||
pc|d7|nt|lestergold: 7N is technically better as well because if clubs broke badly you would have the spade position to fall back on|pg||
nt|sharkey: 7@S depending on the @S finesse|pg||
nt|april7: but after ruff S is endplayed|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so you had to have lots of bids that acted as invites. Partner bid on if he really did have an opening bid, and passed otherwise|pg||
nt|rv: Kushari would have accepted Inv to slam with max (13-14) for his stated minimum (10-14)|pg||
nt|kaz08833: now the time to @D shift but it's rather tough|pg||
nt|kastan88: now will work signals for defense, how good they are|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: right I concede @C guess :( sorry|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|haans: would have gone on if after 2nt invite|pg||
nt|haans: bridge not like all time|pg||
nt|haans: old|pg||
nt|mcarroll: The last thing Declarer will do is lead trumps, has to try for a semi-crossruff in the red suits|pg||
nt|mdgraham: important to know what these doubles are. After the redouble, penalty is a live possibility|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: EW not agree about bidding|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: back later .. bye all|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mcarroll: well stopped|pg||
nt|baardolav: or south can not...|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jaheim: tull   kl Q er jo inntak  :(|pg||
nt|lestergold: funnt south doubles and east can probably manage 3@s they bid on to hopeless 4@d and let off hook|pg||
nt|othered1: right, south has a quite sound opening|pg||
pc|s4|nt|jaheim: y   think cl is trumph|pg||
nt|sharkey: The @S suit has not been mentioned so a mute point|pg||
nt|lestergold: well bid at any raTE ITS GOOD ENUF AT IMPS|pg||
nt|mdgraham: maybe West didn't believe East could have a penalty double of 2@H when he held @HKJ|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Now only 10, no entry to dummy to take the diamond finesse when spades are 3-1|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Declarer got a diamond lead in the other room|pg||
nt|kaz08833: E chose safe defense but lost plus score|pg||
nt|npcjpn: now time for buying a cup of coffee.|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|sharkey: Wonder what wud happen if Jensen opened Multi 2@D here (ref previous board)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|henryb:  I thought this was perhaps a Scandinavian requirement: see 11HCP, Pass not allowed :)|pg||
nt|othered1: Is that tap enough to beat it?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: forcing defense there, early ruffed|pg||
nt|h_karluk: counting|pg||
pc|h2|pc|hT|nt|haans: greast lover of T and 9|pg||
nt|sharkey: 4@H a make here?|pg||
nt|npcjpn: East in the other room also opened!|pg||
nt|super nova: Hard to describe in terms of playing tricks.|pg||
nt|kastan88: if @H8, was switch to somewhere... probably East could switch to dia|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|lestergold: i do not understand my pard vul opens bidding i sit over strong hand with that trump holding they at 4 level im sorry folks i wer bring out a red card pdq|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Alright the other route is x 1@H and make 6.|pg||
nt|xenya: @S lead looked reasonable -- and would have been a killer|pg||
pc|d4|nt|mcarroll: best defence is to continue trumps but not easy from K9|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: W did jump to game, E could make a move|pg||
nt|rnmalik: or bid 1@S and @D later on........................|pg||
nt|h_karluk: no way to set it|pg||
pc|s5|nt|rv: Indian team playing in the event, won the trials to represent India in Commonwealth Bridge Champs at New Delhi later this year, they got a bonus event in first Asian bridge Champs ...|pg||

pc|h8|nt|haans: I would prefer Storöy to be american|pg||
nt|baardolav: pluss 1|pg||
nt|april7: @C would be better,because E might have 3@C|pg||
nt|h_karluk: only @dQ as ice described|pg||
nt|iceblue: dummy would be SQZed|pg||
nt|iceblue: seems -1 now|pg||
nt|othered1: but north can't make it from here|pg||
nt|iceblue: Sun Shud have played @SQ 1st instead of @SA|pg||
nt|h_karluk: just touch diamonds and hope spiit honors|pg||
pc|h5|nt|haans: waited for that|pg||
nt|rv: Ashok Goel playing with Kamal Mukherjee in the OR is sponsor and captain of the team, in my opinion he is one of the best captains and sponsor in the Indian bridge circuit|pg||

nt|pelu: but that dont make me feel better :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Too tough for me|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|lestergold: is there a law against it|pg||
pc|hA|nt|othered1: why @S pitch and not @D on their @C?  If no trump shift, then crossruff high|pg||
nt|kastan88: this time spade lead would take down, but usually I don't like such lead from poor doubleton into dummy's suit|pg||
nt|othered1: still time to tap declarer with another @C|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h3|nt|sharkey: Moysian fit|pg||
nt|npcjpn: 7 tricks for push.|pg||
nt|kastan88: but wasn't easy|pg||

nt|chick: of course I'm famous for detesting moysians :)|pg||

nt|marlowepi: 1D seems fine to me|pg||
nt|chick: again, too good for a preempt|pg||
nt|haans: "Not for person below 100"|pg||
nt|mcarroll: now making all his small trumps with the crossruff - contract making|pg||
nt|april7: 3@H p  p  X  p 4@S|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Sound reasonable to me|pg||
nt|april7: on @H lead then 5,on @D ace lead only 4,but bidding might develop differently|pg||
nt|chick: would you jump to game with N's hand over 3@H P P X?  partner is under pressure and doesn't have to have 20 pts for a X|pg||
nt|april7: you are right, but even over 3@S S will bid 4, but thats a different story|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It was somewhat dangerous cash that last trump and then @DA and king|pg||
nt|super nova: W may also consider 4h good raise ?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that was the logical line|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|april7: N might reopen with a X, then S might reach qa @H contract at 3 level, but EW might compete to 3 @S|pg||

nt|rnmalik: In the OR W opened 1@S and after that 6 was not a problem, previous hand.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 1@h and?|pg||
nt|othered1: Any thoughts on what EW were playing for on last hand?|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: do like 2@S|pg||
nt|jaheim: right|pg||

mb|p|nt|lestergold: form theirmn gross overbidding|pg||

nt|jaheim: men på 2 trinnet,   3 ru er 5 kort imo|pg||
nt|jaheim: D  =  3 @H|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Surely 4@H is the bid|pg||
nt|h_karluk: a simple 2@h rebid expected |pg||
nt|npcjpn: Even 4NT may be too high with a bad club break.|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Spørs hvilke krav meldinger de har til rådighet - hvis 2 NT krav viser farge|pg||
nt|othered1: 3N migh be best on this on NS cards alone, but @H more likely to be found.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: not 2|pg||
nt|chick: moot now as W elected to treat his hand as an opening bid|pg||
nt|npcjpn: it will be tough not leading a spade.|pg||
nt|frankaus: some would open North hand|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but preferred a jump rebid, i guess was useless, slow approach would produce a better way to see what partner have|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: nice swing to the kiwis|pg||

nt|h_karluk: she had Kx while cut with @dK|pg||

mb|3C|nt|sharkey: Good bid by Kvangraven|pg||
nt|lestergold: no lead to beat|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3N|pg||
nt|sharkey: S unsure about @C suit?|pg||
nt|lestergold: south may be tempted to play this in hearts|pg||
nt|jaheim: or lucky, finding p with 10 of @S|pg||
nt|lestergold: if so three rounds of spades with the 9@h ruffing in would not be nice|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4S seems makeable on trump coup|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: may be even 6...|pg||
nt|henryb:  I would prefer 1@s, but ..|pg||
nt|marlowepi: hi henry:)|pg||
nt|henryb:  Hi|pg||
nt|haans: Henry :)|pg||
nt|haans: no alert of 2nt?|pg||
nt|henryb:  1@s would seem to have the advantage that it leaves more room, and your hand is better than a weak jump overcall|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: 2NT was bid as good-bad, but W is not sure. TD at the table|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: 2NT was not alerted|pg||
nt|haans: can be costly|pg||
nt|henryb:  on either side?|pg||
nt|haans: for EW|pg||
nt|henryb:  the alet I mean?|pg||

nt|april7: N did not reopen|pg||
nt|chick: now, S has shown his 20 with a X then cuebid|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if 2@c asks for a four-card major, West should reply 2@D|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, but i don't think a passive lead was indicated on the auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: on the  lead of @CA and a @C?|pg||
nt|sharkey: 500 if axed|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://tinyurl.com/2b44yyj  for results and standings after round 7|pg||

nt|baardolav: the biddings i mean?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Ms Kobayashi likes to open light it seems|pg||
nt|mdgraham: as he hasn't got a four-card major|pg||
nt|kastan88: 4@S for EW (and best is to play that from West hand). Now after @H lead just disaster|pg||
nt|h_karluk: now now|pg||

nt|h_karluk: dangerous seas for NS|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: Steph should make this without much trouble|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: she'll worry that if the trump King is offside, she is in danger of going off (@D ruff)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes but no choice of trump play|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: she also has a lot of losers to 'do' something with. Throw them on spades, looks appealing.. but entries and maintaining control are important|pg||
pc|c8|nt|lestergold: 9 claimable immediate tricks|pg||
nt|sharkey: In my view an awful convention - tell opps your distribution|pg||

nt|h_karluk: not an easy grand decision but its there|pg||

nt|mdgraham: yes|pg||
nt|sybarra: grand doesnt make on the lay out |pg||
nt|frankaus: they must be playing michaels = anty strenght|pg||
nt|npcjpn: If North open this hand, South must invite with 4NT, but this is a new partnership..|pg||

pc|h7|pc|hA|nt|rv: yes I expected hand eval closer to 18 hcp |pg||

pc|h9|nt|jaheim: or 1400|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|lestergold: i suppose can afford it|pg||
nt|sharkey: @C lead beats it I think|pg||

nt|kiwi_joker: yes, got the doubleton heart lead from South and play was a breeze|pg||
pc|d3|nt|lestergold: ten tricks then|pg||
pc|d7|nt|pelu: @H8 and @C to K would be a very nice defense|pg||

pc|dQ|pc|d6|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes, the nightmare scenario for declarer is if the EW @Cs were reversed|pg||
nt|mdgraham: even with diamonds coming in, North has only eight tricks, and entries are a problem|pg||
nt|h_karluk: their 9 cards @c fit masked|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c5|nt|lestergold: agree it seems pretty ugly to me|pg||

nt|april7: is N considering a X???|pg||

nt|Walddk4: No matter what, 2@H worked like a dream|pg||

nt|h_karluk: @Sk|pg||

nt|sharkey: 3@D - 3 NT|pg||
nt|mcarroll: OK Natural :)|pg||
nt|npcjpn: or 3@c by North and 3@s by South.|pg||
nt|davidstern: 6@C would be a good spot|pg||
nt|npcjpn: if you open light, you have to be lucky.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: would you bid 2@D in S?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but sun might pick a moysian fit idea with her x|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaheim: 2 hj med 4 kortstøtte,  ja ja, ikke min melding|pg||
nt|sharkey: if East were ready to bid 4@C on 3@D he shud be able to do the same over 2@H|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Hi Martin. |pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@d South African transfer to 4@S....|pg||

nt|xenya: but...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 3@h invites auto x|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but nobody dared|pg||
nt|npcjpn: not so bad if EW in the other room makes 4@H.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: Hardly|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South really playing with fire here. You suspect 3@s would have been passed out|pg||
nt|jaheim: D   is @H lead|pg||
nt|davidstern: It seems the NS style may be to support immediately with 3 spades but I suspect that the bidding is consistent with 3 spades and six clubs perhaps|pg||
nt|h_karluk: however slam, no heart losers, only a club loser|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: very true, but 2@D with those @S's was a real crime|pg||
pc|d9|nt|lestergold: combined 24 points doesnt have to bid game|pg||
nt|jaheim: mm   1 nt opening in W|pg||
nt|chick: at least S didn't draw the fatal (to defenders) club lead by bidding them|pg||
nt|chick: now can N find a heart?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Well Leaped|pg||
nt|rnmalik: agree.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 11 easy tricks with hearts 3-2|pg||
nt|rnmalik: or 3 as suggested by a kib.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: not vul and good lead directing|pg||
nt|super nova: I wouldnt bid 2@d as south.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|henryb:  but woud you bid less than game opposite partner's opening 1@s?|pg||
nt|chick: booo|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Good lead.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: For defence.|pg||
nt|chick: pretty skinny GF by S|pg||
nt|npcjpn: 4@d splinter discourages.|pg||
nt|davidstern: North may be aiming for 6@C|pg||
nt|davidstern: which would be playable opposite nothing more than the @SK and @CAQ|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|sharkey: Vet ikke hvor N fant doblingen i Åpent Rom?|pg||
nt|sharkey: 5@C makes - not 6...|pg||
nt|henryb:  If 4@d is forcing, I approve, otherwise 5@d seems indicated|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2S was said to be GF\|pg||
nt|chick: if 2@S is GF....|pg||
nt|jaheim: so   10 points  is enough 4 a gf?   strange|pg||
nt|davidstern: Ino may have been better supporting clubs to allow South to better judge the hand|pg||
nt|super nova: More likly to consider 3@d|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|sharkey: Fant den her og...|pg||
nt|sharkey: I think South's hand is NTish - wud have tried 3@D to make pd bid 3 NT with @D stopper|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes, its frustrating when you find later that you pushed them to a  possibly making game |pg||
nt|april7: @S @S @S the W should discard ace of @C on 3d @D|pg||
nt|davidstern: South should now bid six with the @SK and a singleton heart|pg||
pc|s2|nt|haans: holy ...|pg||
nt|haans: xy Stayman in Sweden we belive that was invented in Denmark long time ago|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Miss Jane pulled most probably Miss Greta would respond|pg||
pc|s7|nt|chick: agree|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i think S should bid 5C over 3D, then he is in position to pass 5D|pg||
nt|henryb:  Suth could not affort Blackwood|pg||
nt|marlowepi: right|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|rv: this format is not favorite of many of the purists who prefer k/o matches to decide top placings since this format favors beating weak teams comprehensively|pg||
nt|frankaus: 2@H says pd did u have a decent overcall - pd passes to say no,|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: oh dear not optimum defence :(|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|mdgraham: after the 3@D rebid, most players play 3@S as competitive only - they either double or bid 3@H as a game try|pg||
nt|sybarra: oh oh |pg||
nt|bucheister: oops|pg||
nt|h_karluk: this is too high|pg||
nt|sybarra: a bit too much |pg||

nt|april7: only hope for E to get in if K or Q of @C|pg||
nt|april7: thats an interesting defence|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes 2 promises a few more values|pg||
pc|d5|nt|lestergold: as spec pointsn o9ut he has forced himnself to bid 4@c over 3@d by his pard whcih would be overdoing the hand|pg||
nt|april7: W must  pray S having another @H|pg||
nt|Walddk4: some would claim|pg||
nt|npcjpn: no claim yet?|pg||
nt|sybarra: some imps back to palestine most likely |pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think Miss Greta forgot who was the captain|pg||

pc|dT|nt|kiwibridge: def a coffee hand this one Steve|pg||
pc|d3|pg||

nt|frankaus: quite a good method IMO|pg||
pc|s5|nt|sharkey: East got the clue he neede|pg||
nt|haans: i agree 5@D not 4@D best bid|pg||
nt|rnmalik: In any case then only NS may be in game or slam.|pg||
pc|sA|nt|rnmalik: AK@S and @HK pitching 3@Ds and @D finesse and one @C loser.|pg||
nt|april7: 5 of @S = @C entry|pg||

pc|sT|nt|mdgraham: best|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Well, she enjoys playing|pg||
nt|npcjpn: only three pitch on diamonds.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Apart from that a valuable contribution by a spec that 3@D being bergen raise could be x by N with all the values and @C suit. |pg||
pc|sJ|nt|henryb:  5@d over 3@d would have implied the stiff club|pg||

nt|vugraphznb: last board in this match|pg||
nt|sharkey: So the Cider King and his kids take the lead 11-4|pg||
nt|chick: Thanks to our excellent operator, Liv Marit Grude, for a great job :)|pg||
nt|haans: to both table urKKKK|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, well. Lucky old South :)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Strage - it appears as 3NT in results?|pg||
nt|jaheim: 1nt +3 in open  rom was a lot  |pg||
nt|jaheim: sry +2|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Everything lies well, especially @Hs so losing 3@S and a @D only|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 3@Cs sorry|pg||
nt|jaheim: next    pls|pg||
nt|april7: last hand of the match|pg||
nt|chick: E knew partner had the @CA|pg||
nt|chick: so the hearts didn't matter any more|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: last hand in this tournament|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: thnx all|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: the winner of this match will win the ch.ship|pg||
nt|pelu: or to let opp belive that they have a trick|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It is of course against the laws to delay the game unneccessarily|pg||
nt|rv: I prefer ACBL format or initial RR followed by k/o like in World Series, not a big fan of this format|pg||
nt|frankaus: one can still get a "flat pitch" V a weak tem and be disadvantaged though|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 7@c kind of double a battery attitude|pg||
nt|sybarra: am told, by spec wrong answer, thinks n/s play 0314 |pg||
nt|bucheister: Interesting that they took so long to play that hand;  I like to get it over with quickly|pg||
nt|frankaus: 300 looks like a pickup 4 NS |pg||
nt|xenya: indeed|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that means they give up to use weak 2 as preempts|pg||
nt|iceblue: 2@D|pg||
nt|bucheister: that might be shortness|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: oh dear painful to watch really :)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: whats this now 5SX +1|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: so 3 imp loss but miles better than going down|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: now back to 7 cunning|pg||
nt|vugraphzrc: ok|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: W opened but Christine and Jenna had no trouble reaching 3N|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: 3NT bid and made looks a good result for NZ, with West sitting over  dummy's only 2 honour cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: ie let him make his own mistakes or no0t as the case may be|pg||
nt|baardolav: need two entries for the heart... |pg||
nt|jaheim: but only 1 entery  to E hand|pg||
nt|baardolav: yeah... |pg||
nt|kastan88: Hi Raju|pg||
nt|kastan88: GM Roland|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Hello Jaak|pg||
nt|kaz08833: NS can make 6@s?|pg||
mb|1D|nt|lestergold: not provide him with a route map to 9 tricks|pg||
nt|sharkey: Rite - and discrading !K at the end position and keeping 3 x @C may have resulted in a set|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Last board of this segment, interesting hands as reflected by the respective scores, no unwanted swings.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's written black on white|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But maybe she could not see that she had 11 tricks; that's an excuse|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but in 0314 4N>5@c 0-3. 5@d 1-4, 5@h 2 and 5@s 2+ trump Q is not it ?|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes still |pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes a mini splinter 3@C was X'd by N|pg||
nt|iceblue: 2@D=WK 2M|pg||
mb|d|nt|sharkey: The challenge here is to bid game|pg||
nt|davidstern: South got a heart lead and carelessly ruffed a diamond losing all communication with dummy|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe pulled wrong card out of bidding box|pg||
nt|h_karluk: could be|pg||
nt|ralfwil: the "new" house is built 1932, but they have spent a lot of money to make it "up to date"|pg||
nt|xenya: another partscore battle coming?|pg||
nt|iceblue: 2@H=pre with 2 majors|pg||
nt|iceblue: 2@S=@S+m|pg||
mb|1N|nt|sharkey: @DK|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: 3@h is slamtry with @c|pg||
nt|jaheim: too lata again :(|pg||
nt|jaheim: late|pg||
nt|sybarra: happens to all of us |pg||
nt|h_karluk: very aggressive 2@h|pg||
nt|sybarra: looks like tartan 2 suited type bid|pg||
nt|suketbombi: a close Match till now Phillippines doing well to Take the Might of Patrick and his Team|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: 7 stikk mulig her|pg||
nt|jaheim: no  3 nt looks ok it playing on @Ds|pg||
nt|henryb:  but would you with AKK and four trumps, a couple of extra jacks and a doubleton?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: sneaking admiration for double by North |pg||
nt|h_karluk: this would make east's day|pg||
nt|h_karluk: with 18 easy to buy|pg||
nt|kaz08833: seems 6@S by N is virtually cold|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: was a lightner X I guess|pg||

nt|haans: BBO Schedule your time: http://www.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php |pg||
nt|mcarroll: a good 6 @D possible?|pg||
nt|frankaus: 5@D looks a good chance|pg||
nt|kaz08833: yes W might dbl 6@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|jaheim: if   playing|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Or 6NT? with 12 tops?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: A bit surprising nobody found the red card after 4@S in OR|pg||
nt|npcjpn: vulnerbale, second seat and bad suit...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: could cost a packet, of course |pg||
nt|h_karluk: http://www.pattayabridge.com/conventions/Tartan-twos.htm|pg||
nt|bucheister: I would imagine that we will see a lot of those is Philly|pg||
nt|bucheister: thank you|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Philly prices are interesting|pg||
nt|sybarra: you will be in Philly John?  I will likely be opperating |pg||
nt|h_karluk: you are welcome|pg||
nt|iceblue: wang PASS = suggest playing 2@D|pg||
nt|h_karluk: why not 3@d|pg||
nt|h_karluk: offers to play at 3 level M|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: as all others try for game|pg||
nt|sharkey: S bid 2@H OR|pg||
nt|henryb:  I remind kibitzers that while I deeply appreciate comments I will not respond to anyone who does not have the courtesy to put their full names in their profile|pg||
nt|april7: switchto @H is best|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridgeunlimited.com/bridge/DisplayResultsT4?club_event_id=15508&header=pabf&fdc=TKFMSZTDG  for running scores in all matches|pg||
nt|davidstern: I took an oath never to bid 3N T with a void in partner's suit but that was in 1975|pg||
nt|davidstern: I should say I have stuck with it ever since|pg||
nt|pelu: borderline 2@D (Michael) in Red|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Amazing, EW sold out to 2@S on board 6 in the open room|pg||
nt|kastan88: till now closed, but last 2 boards may be good results for Taipei, as 5th board Philippines lost 4@S and in 6th is possible to bid and win 3NT|pg||
nt|super nova: I think I would find a 2@S bid|pg||
nt|iceblue: dbl 2@D= 13-15 bal or 19+ any|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: but then A@H didn't cash|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: N has 8 tricks own hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: as would I|pg||
nt|sharkey: Will get to game now|pg||
nt|Walddk4: West doubled 1NT, then she doubled 2@D and then she passed 2@S|pg||
nt|rv: Laltu should pass here, not enough for raise to 3@d in my opinion|pg||
nt|bucheister: seems that 3D is automatic|pg||
nt|iceblue: 3@D is a little agreesive|pg||
nt|npcjpn: but it was East who doubled. |pg||
nt|kaz08833: 4@H might show H void|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: seems all too wierd|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: this could get passed out|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sharkey: 2NT Invitational Values min @S and 4 card support|pg||
nt|april7: but cross ruff is already open|pg||
nt|npcjpn: @dQ and @CK are great card for East.|pg||
nt|kaz08833: i'm not sure of NS's 3@H and 4@H difference|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: wowee|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|jaheim: but needs to lead a @D, i think|pg||
nt|lestergold: moral of this session has been when you are dealt a double then double|pg||
nt|sharkey: Why didnt S bid 3 NT?|pg||
nt|haans: invite or not invite that is the question|pg||
nt|haans: 2@H prermpt in my book|pg||
nt|chick: after the X, 2@H shows 8+ in my book :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: last board in this match|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: 2 matches to go|pg||
nt|mcarroll: After I predicted a flat board on 6 I hesitate to say anything here - But............|pg||
nt|jaheim: 1   i think   ,  Liv Marit|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: yes, you're right jaheim|pg||
nt|april7: I think losing at most 2 @S and 2 aces|pg||
nt|vugraphznb: one more match|pg||
nt|h_karluk: you know people didn't much attend even to GNT finals|pg||
nt|sybarra: http://www.bridgeunlimited.com/bridge/ViewMasterEvent2?code=10ASIA&header=pabf|pg||
nt|sybarra: that is only site I have|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: W overcalled 1@D with his vul 7 count, guess E was provoked|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: so looks like 10 to NZ|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: a bonus indeed|pg||
pc|s6|nt|davidstern: And even then......|pg||
nt|npcjpn: @D to 9.|pg||
nt|npcjpn: East should have @CA instead of @CKJ to bid 3@D.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: agree, and a trump short as well|pg||
nt|frankaus: looks a too round for my liking|pg||
nt|h_karluk: as i inspected $23 each session for open pairs|pg||
nt|bucheister: philly is pricey; the large market next to the Marriott is just great; I could eat there everyday; fresh seafood; pastas; every type of food served in small booth areas at ...|pg||
nt|bucheister: reasonable prices|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i ve never been in Philly but heard there's a great Metro system|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|haans: AKK is extra in it self|pg||
nt|henryb:  better case at matchpoints|pg||
nt|sharkey: We would all lead @HQ vs 3 NT and set it....|pg||
nt|chick: and I have a known double fit in the majors (assuming a normal takeout double)|pg||
nt|sharkey: I wud bid 2@D to show both M and some points|pg||
nt|haans: yep good for 2@D instead of @H bid|pg||
nt|frankaus: friendly @H layout|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, will make|pg||
nt|othered1: 3@D by whom?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: W|pg||
pc|c7|nt|haans: im on Volls side|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Depends what 2NT showed|pg||
nt|bucheister: West|pg||
nt|npcjpn: in open room, West bid 5@d as (probably) a lead-directing, and East thought it creates a forcing pass, I guess.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: if xx was an offer to play 5@DXX S should have grabbed it|pg||
pc|cA|nt|lestergold: there has been a fair amountg of no trump avoidance too|pg||
nt|sharkey: May work out ok|pg||
nt|sharkey: 5@C that is|pg||
nt|lestergold: im susrprised that 3n failed in open room|pg||
nt|haans: yes at IMP you seldom pass before game|pg||
nt|chick: that would also work if such agreed|pg||
nt|sharkey: This won't be easy|pg||
nt|mcarroll: True Roland|pg||
nt|mdgraham: NS wil be quite pleased to gain an imp after going four down vulnerable in a freely-bid game |pg||
nt|sybarra: great city and hotel location is right down town, easy to get around|pg||
pc|c5|nt|sharkey: Solves trump problem|pg||
nt|lestergold: well ive checked play first took club the unatural way then after spade switch took a secons spade finesse rather than dim finesse when defenders had warned himn that spades were ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: both 'wrong'|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Well, the cardinal sin, Mike. Declarer had his contract but went for overtricks|pg||
nt|sharkey: Viego will suffer their first defeat |pg||
nt|h_karluk: I liked The Marriot, have been there in many sectionals, regionals|pg||
nt|h_karluk: classy|pg||
nt|super nova: Doesnt promise any points.|pg||
nt|xenya: easy to play too|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|henryb:  if partner signs off the game may be less than 50%|pg||
nt|davidstern: South will switch to a spade at a million miles and hour if East plays another diamond |pg||
nt|pelu: yes KJ no value when pd 5-5 in major|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridgeunlimited.com/bridge/ViewMasterEvent2?code=10ASIA&header=pabf  for results|pg||
nt|pelu: a major Q better than @cK|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: has already denied many :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: x 13-15 or 19+ any|pg||
pc|s5|nt|lestergold: i see contract failed in open but surely playing on clubs declarer should make this|pg||
nt|haans: you need a good 50% to bid non vul games|pg||
nt|haans: better bidding than OR|pg||
nt|pelu: ??????????????|pg||
nt|npcjpn: East probably hoped miracle AQ in majors.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Sophia is lucky that this does not cost the contract|pg||
nt|kaz08833: xx = @DK and 5@H = ask for something?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|lestergold: play for split honours in clubs shoul lose a heart a club and a diamond at most|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Last board for the match. Back in 10-15 mins|pg||
pc|s7|nt|sharkey: Had to lead @D9 for a set|pg||
nt|sharkey: Needed @H lead - not @HQ - to make|pg||

nt|kastan88: *not lost 4@S, just didn't find right 4@S :)|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 2@C should be fine here unless declerer looses 3 @HS 2@CS and @S unlikely|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|april7: now almost 4@H|pg||
nt|pelu: but she is almost endplayed |pg||
nt|npcjpn: the other 8 is better to shift.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: She had 3 to choose from :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South may have protected with 2@H, of course|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mcarroll: Extraordinary set, 53 imps in 6 boards - and more to come!!|pg||
nt|kaz08833: both sides did their best.. very good auction by both|pg||
pc|cK|nt|Walddk4: 20-22 maybe|pg||
nt|april7: 1@S and 2 aces, sorry|pg||
nt|Walddk4: "Set up your side suit first" is a good rule|pg||
nt|npcjpn: strange play. @HA then low and guess.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: ruff is welcome no guesses need now|pg||
pc|c3|nt|sharkey: Ø må spille på at N må ha begge Ess for å vinne kontrakten|pg||
nt|lestergold: it wasnt for overtrick played for split spade honours rather than dim finesse which a priori was better odds but suspicous on the dfence|pg||
nt|sharkey: First make your contract - THEN overtricks...|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Thanks Liv Marit!|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|haans: evry tim you do wrong Have a talk with p|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Winning the ace was strange for a start|pg||
nt|frankaus: quite hard for me as I would be plotting for the beer card|pg||
pc|s8|nt|lestergold: 9 dimds would be a better card to play by east|pg||
nt|sharkey: killing lead - but nobody lead high from xxx??|pg||
nt|pelu: why not play @C8 - only chance is to find Q10x in C in N = discard for 3@Ss|pg||
pc|sK|nt|Walddk4: Mike, BOA and Martin|pg||
nt|npcjpn: now North knows South has another spade, so the defense is not tough.|pg||
nt|frankaus: i meant for N to X |pg||
pc|s9|nt|lestergold: we are seeing a lot of card play shall we say less than perfect plays in this match|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|suketbombi: wud duck the @H return i suppose while @C shift will make things easy for him|pg||
pc|hK|nt|april7: why not 3 of @D from N?|pg||
nt|jaheim: and it will be a pleasure tu buy   Liv M a beer next year   tx  all   and cong. to team   Ugh|pg||
nt|rv: East (Deb Majumder aka Laltu) is the youngest member of the team, he is in his early thirties and this is his first Intl tourney|pg||
nt|kaz08833: now claim|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes|pg||
pc|h2|nt|rv: I am sure he must be fairly nervous|pg||
nt|xenya: or not so easy? |pg||
pc|h7|nt|lestergold: shall we say less than optimum views|pg||
nt|haans: OR forgot  most pass bids|pg||
nt|sybarra: hmm surprised she didnt just cover S card|pg||
nt|othered1: 3@D by west would h ave been too pushy for me.   Should be saved for maximums, not just good shape|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|jaheim: går bet nå  stor kl fra hånden hadde vært bedre denne gang|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes but it wasnt that was tying to makem it took ;wrong' view|pg||

nt|suketbombi: pity 6@H on a @H guess and languising in 3@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: diff hand for S - some would bid 1NT|pg||
nt|rv: India coming back a bit in bowling power-play|pg||

nt|h_karluk: i expect 4@c|pg||

nt|pelu: a fight for the 7. trick - I exp that West wil win that battle|pg||
nt|kastan88: just such preempts, with outside A are not good|pg||

nt|iceblue: wow¡£¡£¡£|pg||
nt|h_karluk: why not 1@h John? @h and @s are not both 10+ openings with 5+ cards?:)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but if u meant rebid problem ok|pg||
nt|kaz08833: S's 1NT must be CRASH (@S and @D OR @H and @C)|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|h_karluk: std @d K lead, but depends players, @c or @s also available|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridgeunlimited.com/bridge/ViewMasterEvent2?code=10ASIA&header=pabf  for results|pg||
nt|bucheister: equal length|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think KNR would bid 1@h in any natural sys, chances much|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|npcjpn: from the bidding, North is marked with at most 3@s and 1@h, so must have 5+@d.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 19 teams in the open, 16 in the women's|pg||
nt|sybarra: must say E was not bashful |pg||
nt|npcjpn: oh, i see. |pg||
nt|kaz08833: N's 4@H is pass or correct|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|npcjpn: win with @HK? Now case for typical second hand high for North.|pg||
nt|pelu: best to play a small @S now|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Our match in round 4 will be India v Sri Lanka (open)|pg||
nt|suketbombi: No shame if u just bid your game and make it but 3@D is the worst possible contract for E-W|pg||
nt|super nova: This reminds me of a hand my partner had Monday|pg||
nt|othered1: west still has no clue that east doesn't have @Sxx and @CK (xx)|pg||
nt|iceblue: Gee...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: all filled in cards there, only need few picture cards in M|pg||
pc|s7|nt|h_karluk: suits|pg||
nt|npcjpn: i did not notice 1@c was strong because there is no alert.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|rv: I agree with Sanyal that North did have a case for leading a @s with no entry in his hand trying to lead partner's major|pg||
nt|super nova: AKQJx|pg||
nt|rnmalik: imo 3@H was the order of the day in E.|pg||
nt|super nova: QTxx|pg||

nt|iceblue: lovely bidding|pg||

nt|othered1: Silly bidding|pg||
nt|bucheister: 4nt is wild and crazy|pg||
nt|h_karluk: would make slam|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: It's Steph's style to raise on 3-cards there|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|othered1: That's a  huge overstatement.  Many won't with only one ace and no kings.|pg||
pc|sT|nt|sybarra: but "only 50's" at the point |pg||
pc|c4|nt|npcjpn: cross ruff seems best.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://www.bridgeunlimited.com/bridge/DisplayResultsT4?club_event_id=15507&header=pabf&fdc=CLZRUZTDG for women's scores|pg||

nt|npcjpn: and East has a club suit:)|pg||
pc|s9|nt|npcjpn: 3 side aces and six trump tricks is enough for 3@h.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Alywn Jihe|pg||
nt|iceblue: hi all|pg||
nt|npcjpn: hi|pg||
nt|iceblue: wlcome to watch the 1st Asia cup bridge championships|pg||

pc|h6|pg||
nt|kastan88: pls mention, NS line have good 4@S :)|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes and too strong for this Vul also West who has a great @D fit and a singleton with 3 more Controls? difficult to imagine|pg||
pc|c8|nt|kastan88: if don't open 3@S they possibly intervent to bidding and find that sac |pg||
pc|c5|nt|Walddk4: Round-robin among 19 teams (one sit-out per round)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: many of us would pass with east's cards|pg||
nt|super nova: they went to game because they said they had 16 points.|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|kastan88: oops! I meant 3@D opening|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|rv: of-course you have a lot to answer to team-mates if first 5@h tricks were cashable|pg||
nt|bucheister: lead director:<)|pg||

pc|c2|pc|c9|nt|npcjpn: the organizer pays everything but air fee, i was told.|pg||
nt|pelu: would not help N to play @SK - decl would duck|pg||
nt|super nova: they upgraded each of the JX to 2 points ? |pg||
nt|super nova: of course that went down.|pg||
pc|c6|pg||

nt|super nova: with a max of 23 reevaluated points and a min or 20.|pg||

nt|h_karluk: *righty|pg||

nt|bucheister: stop|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: what happened - did the deal just change?|pg||
mb|1C|nt|sybarra: it was just 2 @s and she had 7 of them + a void |pg||
mb|p|nt|npcjpn: do you overcall 2@C?|pg||
nt|dslee: Kushari should bid 3@D|pg||
nt|kastan88: say, if pass with W hand or open 1@D, then South possibly bidding t/o double after 1@H from East, and spades easily found|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: operator - we have skipped 2 boards?|pg||
mb|1D|nt|pelu: bad luck for NS-players - 4@S down 1 with 3 @c-losers|pg||

nt|h_karluk: so different ideas wld always be there, there were a slam u know and wld b nice if they'd land|pg||
nt|kaz08833: coffee time came up after all|pg||
nt|npcjpn: 2@d = one major|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 2@D?|pg||
nt|kaz08833: 2@D = @S OR @H|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: W will guess what it is|pg||
mb|1H|nt|npcjpn: 2, 3 or 4@S.|pg||
nt|dslee: to create some problem for NS to reach their game|pg||
nt|sybarra: now we know its a club system of some sort|pg||
nt|xenya: what's that?|pg||
nt|npcjpn: some calls woolsey, some calls multi-landy or reversed cappelletti|pg||
nt|kaz08833: 4@H or 3NT by EW is cold anyway|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: The double is a bit askew .. surely it's just a 2@H bid by South|pg||
nt|vugraphzrc: yeah,i will ask them|pg||
mb|1N|nt|kiwibridge: horrible red suits :(|pg||
nt|bucheister: notice they do not open very light in 3rd seat; I like 1H at this vulnerability|pg||
nt|othered1: You're saying that stayman was the right start to that hand?  It seems wrong if they have either transfer bids or 2-way stayman available.|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceblue: 4@S? 3@C? cant be, it is the famous 5332|pg||
nt|npcjpn: i guessed wrong.|pg||
nt|rv: KP is worth a bid of 4@s with his hand, all useful cards and 5th @s|pg||
nt|dslee: most likely 4@H now|pg||
nt|rv: I presume he is setting GF with 3@d cue in case partner has a big hand|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: presume 2@H a cunning pass ot correct woozle|pg||

pc|s6|nt|vugraphzrc: sorry|pg||

nt|npcjpn: now coffee hand.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|rv: he has guessed well though|pg||

pc|s4|nt|iceblue: i was told EW was playing standard, wk NT|pg||

nt|rnmalik: A@D and 4@S would be a make.|pg||
nt|kastan88: bergen raise would work here, not easy to find now 3@S stop|pg||
nt|npcjpn: undo please.|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: 8 top tricks now .. and leading diamonds towards dummy brings a 9th|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|suketbombi: Friendly @S & @HS should be a cool 420 for E-W|pg||
nt|kaz08833: not coffee time for an operator :)|pg||

pc|sA|pg||

pc|d7|pg||
nt|pelu: the first 5 tricks for defense?|pg||
nt|npcjpn: so 3NT has more chance than 3@c.|pg||
nt|kastan88: i would not double with passed partner, IMO better to say just 1@S overcall and hope for possibility later to double for max overcall, if needed|pg||
nt|othered1: There goes the possible 3rd @S trick|pg||
nt|h_karluk: fortunately @s8 at the table|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes always N|pg||
pc|dT|nt|super nova: The consideration here is likly the diamonds.|pg||

pc|d6|pc|c6|pc|s2|pg||
nt|Walddk4: yes|pg||

nt|h_karluk: and @h j entry there|pg||
pc|s9|pc|sT|nt|npcjpn: on board 10, open room EW got to 6@c and down with a spade ruff.|pg||
pc|sK|nt|rv: he can claim 1 down and go to next deal|pg||
nt|xenya: my opinion too|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|npcjpn: If North reopens 1NT instead of 2@H, NS will get there.|pg||
nt|suketbombi: strange line one looser in every suit now|pg||
pc|d9|nt|Walddk4: Would not be unreasonable to lead a low spade, but it's a disaster as the cards lie|pg||
nt|lmeili: he expects to have @d 3-3 & @s 2-2 break|pg||
nt|kastan88: yes, have not chance, if @HA not right, so still needed to play to @HK|pg||

nt|npcjpn: looking for 5-3 spade fit.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Normal play is to take a double finesse in diamonds|pg||

nt|iceblue: 1S=0-3cards @S, kiwi|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: ok. But he probably wouldnt have ducked trick 1 with A9xx in the suit|pg||
nt|npcjpn: but the play may be different if West has @SA9xx.|pg||
nt|rv: he needs @c finesse, @s break for starters and need to get 3@c tricks w/o losing a trick in that suit|pg||

pc|hK|nt|super nova: The 8 imps will probably change to 11 imps out.|pg||
nt|xenya: no chance here, with @HK offside?|pg||

nt|pelu: 4@C = cue bid agree @hs|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's good news for Kobayashi that partner doesn't have a diamond cue|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Then she knows all her high cards are working|pg||
nt|pelu: west like to go on - but what to bid - 4@D = last train?|pg||

nt|Walddk4: @HAKQ  @SK|pg||
nt|suketbombi: bd 11 a sure 6 or 10 imps on bd 10 also a potential swing on bd 12 will give chinese taipei a huge lead|pg||

nt|npcjpn: In open room, East opened 2@d multi as a dealer to jam the auction.|pg||
mb|p|nt|super nova: if your partner reopens with X|pg||
nt|kaz08833: i agree S's fit showing 3@D|pg||
nt|npcjpn: now North needs only two red aces.|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: for 7?|pg||
nt|kaz08833: N expects S is likely to have @HA and @DKQ (or KJ)?|pg||
nt|npcjpn: for six. for seven 2 red aces plus @dK|pg||
mb|2N|nt|npcjpn: even using last train, West is too strong for that.|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes but still e too weak to take this up|pg||
nt|lmeili: E may bid it|pg||
mb|p|nt|super nova: then you are going to have to bid 1nt anyway,.. but now you have shown 0-5 points and will feel guilty.|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: not quite it didn't reach the boundary|pg||
mb|3C|nt|kiwi_joker: lol, we are twins again, nobuyuki|pg||
nt|npcjpn: 4@h = artificial slam try in @S?|pg||
nt|iceblue: yes|pg||
nt|iceblue: do they play puppet? seems 3@S=5cards|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: interesting method (4@H slam try). What would 4@C and 4@D have been, then?|pg||
nt|npcjpn: How about natural, 5+ suit?|pg||
nt|npcjpn: with 4-card major and 5+card minor, slam interest.|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: ok, good treatment|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Long tank then 4@H I don't like|pg||
nt|rv: @SJ guess here|pg||
nt|rv: lot of IMPs ride on the guess of @s knave here|pg||

mb|4H|nt|iceblue: 5@H, 5@S, pass all,:)|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: So if east had shown 5@H (and west had a fit), 3@S is the mirror approach? Slam interest in hearts?|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 1430/|pg||
mb|p|nt|suketbombi: has to drop doubleton Q on AK and back @HS|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: South decides it's time to try and peg back a few IMPs, with a rather desperate raise to game.|pg||
mb|p|nt|npcjpn: i play 3@S over 3@h as slam try in @h.|pg||
nt|rv: natural course of play will force him to guess right as per prediction|pg||
nt|lmeili: when he bids it, he will make it, no choice|pg||
mb|p|nt|suketbombi:  AK and 3rd heart is the best but decl has no choice|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: yes, well done I say :)|pg||
pc|cT|nt|kiwi_joker: so they have bid it... very understandable, just without hope on this layout|pg||
nt|iceblue: dislike 6@S, 5@D deny controls in @C, |pg||
nt|npcjpn: completely agree with Roland.|pg||
nt|npcjpn: If West bids 4@s over 4@c, East will bid 7@H.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: sure|pg||
nt|pelu: is 4@S here forcing ?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: She will get !AKQ and 4@S shows an honour|pg||
nt|Walddk4: @HAKQ|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Should be Peter. Hearts are set after 4@C|pg||
nt|npcjpn: I do not like 4@s non forcing after 4-level cue bid.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Don't you agree?|pg||
nt|pelu: not sure|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I think it's pretty simple. You can sign-off in 4@H, you can't in 4@S|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Easy to remember|pg||
nt|npcjpn: so hard to forget|pg||
nt|pelu: in CR EW had a better action: 2@H - 3@H - 3@S - after 4NT - 5@S East bid 5NT - but West didnt accept|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|iceblue: he need @HA, !K @Sk to make 6@S, its impossible, i think|pg||
nt|npcjpn: On this lead, declarer may think he has a chance in guessing, but...|pg||
nt|iceblue: but got is not sitting behind him:)|pg||
nt|npcjpn: but if declarer gives up clubs, then North has to play @h|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 3@H is probably better when playing 2/1|pg||
pc|cA|nt|suketbombi: donno the provocation to bid with 5hcp and that weak @S suit inispite of the 2nt bid but may work here tho|pg||
nt|rnmalik: yes can, N's bid is one over one, can only be 5@S+|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|npcjpn: with @c 3-3, now no need for @d finesse.|pg||
