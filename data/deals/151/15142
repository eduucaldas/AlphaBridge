pc|dA|pc|d2|pc|d8|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s9|pc|s3|pc|s5|pg||
nt|brolucius: South had the option, presumably, of bidding 5NT after his 4NT. This would tell partner that all the key cards were held and invite him to bid a grand slam. |pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C|mb|2D|an|multy|mb|d|mb|2H|an|p/c|mb|3H|mb|d|nt|petergill: East is one of the world's greatest players. His website is http://www.martensuniversity.com/. |pg||
nt|brolucius: North's 2@H means that he want to go no higher (understandably) if South's major is hearts.|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|h4|nt|petergill: Martens' books and training are highly recommended - some of his books have been translated into English|pg||
nt|brolucius: South doubles 3@H to tell partner that this is his suit. If he omitted to do this, North might on some auctions bid high in spades, assuming that South held spades.|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c8|nt|brolucius: It seems to me that East's 3@H was a bit risky, since it might have been read as natural (with South's suit not yet known). But West held hearts and did not raise so they clearly ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: knew what they were doing.|pg||
nt|petergill: At least 1100 looks achievable if East can double 2@H for take-out and West converts to penalty|pg||
nt|jbgood: perhaps it would have paid off to double 2 hearts? |pg||
pc|cT|pc|cQ|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h3|nt|brolucius: Perhaps that would have shown hearts?|pg||
nt|petergill: At both tables, the vulnerable penalty was not taken|pg||

nt|jbgood: even clearer to double by E in the other room...|pg||

pc|c4|nt|olliebol: the grand was missed to the tune of 11 imps|pg||
nt|othered1: So do I, but maybe they don't play Texas transfers, necessary if this is to be a aslam try|pg||
nt|daman: right|pg||

nt|brolucius: If they are playing Polish Club, 1@C may be a strong hand but is more likely to be based on a weak 1NT (if they rebid 1NT).|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@H maybe?|pg||
nt|roswolf: here definitely strong!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's not necessarily strong. Polish Club 1@C is ... 1. 12-14 balanced (often) - 2. 15+ with clubs - 3. Any 18+ hand|pg||
mb|4H|nt|roswolf: true|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is 3.|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@D is 0-7|pg||
pc|cA|nt|brolucius: West decides he is not worth anything stronger than 4@H (such as 4@C, splinter) because East limited his hand with the 1@D response.|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|roswolf: and a diamond switch!?|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@S can still be a weak NT and is forcing|pg||

pc|s3|pc|h8|nt|jbgood: he would have maed it by ruffing a di, then another spade. If N ruffs in, the di loser goes away|pg||
nt|jbgood: or a club loser|pg||
nt|henryb:  Should have taken his 10 tricks: three side winners, five trumps in hand and two club ruffs|pg||
pc|c6|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.crobridge.com/pula/eng/  for the festival website|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hK|nt|jbgood: but to get the five trump tricks in hand he needed to play another spade from dummy|pg||
