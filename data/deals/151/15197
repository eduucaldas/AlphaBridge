nt|bobh1: 1@d is 14+ in their methods|pg||

pc|cT|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h5|nt|bobh1: one problem with stayman is that it can give the defense gratuitous information if you end in 3N anyway|pg||

pc|s4|pg||

pc|s3|nt|drewsky: Mr. Roth said to bid stayman and then 3NT no matter what opener responded, but if the pulled 3NT to 4M that he has to be 4-4 in the majors and thus would have ruffing value !|pg||
