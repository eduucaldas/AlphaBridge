nt|Walddk4: E-W are Crouch-Patterson and I have their somewhat complicated system in front of me|pg||
nt|sybarra: Roland and Geoffrey |pg||
nt|Walddk4: We may need it|pg||
mb|4H|nt|roswolf: 2@D = SPADES AND ANOTHER I THINK|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Crouch is pitiful on BBO and one of our regular commentators|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1NT is 14-16 in 1st and 2nd|pg||
nt|ady: good morning Kath   David|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hello from Manchester|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: Hi all. Welcome to Solihull|pg||
nt|ady: not much difficulty   especially on likely heart lead|pg||
nt|yo_yo: we saw Townsend & Bakhshi put up a great performance this time yesterday|pg||
nt|daman: Italians always double with hands like East   points before shape|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|daman: I would have passed|pg||

nt|daman: I like lasagna    does that count?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|garnetts: Good morning everyone |pg||
nt|roswolf: yes lots of transfer responses on a strong club base|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3nt has perhaps a chance, but not 4@s|pg||
nt|lestergold: Good afternoon|pg||
nt|lestergold: Hi George|pg||
nt|daman: Hi Mike|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s9|nt|yo_yo: anyone know the results?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: did they keep it up?|pg||
nt|lestergold: all strong players here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Results from round 1: Rosen v Senior 25-4 ; Teltscher v P Hackett 19-11 ; Small v Hinden 17-13, and de Botton v Crouch 16-14|pg||
nt|yo_yo: david are there any results online?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Division 2: FEGARTY beat ROBERTS 25-5; PRYOR beat BIRD 25-5; COOPER beat SHILLITOE 23-7; DHONDY beat COPE 18-11 (Cope was penalised 1 VP for slow play)|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: Players seem very chipper for such an early hour|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|garnetts: I agree Roland but with AQ stiff it is a reasonable bid as long as it cannot be passed |pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s play a standard 5 card major system i think - relatively uncommom in acol land|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h8|nt|yo_yo: good morning from Manchester|pg||

pc|h2|nt|ralfwil: this lead can help declarer|pg||

nt|yo_yo: that's very impressive yes :)|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|mcarroll: another double fit in the Majors|pg||
nt|garnetts: West doing a lot of bidding |pg||
nt|yo_yo: hello again ralf :)|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hT|nt|daman: can make 6 now|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lestergold: predictable lead which stes up 3 heart tricks for declarer|pg||
nt|lestergold: curse the cards!|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Sandqvist - McIntosh are members of the England open team, and Crouch-Patterson have won the Camrose Trophy for England|pg||
nt|roswolf: both very good pairs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Sandqcist originally from Sweden, Tosh from Scotland|pg||
nt|sybarra: defense has to be a bit careful here|pg||
pc|s7|nt|haans: spade loser soon|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Division 1 after 20 boards: Teltscher +19 IMPs v Rosen, Senior +7 IMPs v Small, Crouch +8 IMPs v Hinden, Hackett P +3 IMPs v DeBotton|pg||
pc|c4|pc|sJ|nt|yo_yo: Michelle must have been having kittens with that awful south hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: cashing out|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/w could be candidates for one of the strongest mixed pairs on the planet|pg||
nt|daman: that's a pretty broad statement|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Division 2: Cooper +36 v Dhondy, Cope +27 v Pryor, Roberts +19 v Bird, Fegarty +1 v Shillitoe|pg||

nt|lestergold: but should be suspicious that is exactly what to expect from a player opf King's ability|pg||
nt|ralfwil: anopther way was to play the remaining |pg||
nt|yo_yo: has he forsaken tom townsend?|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes i haD NOTICED EVEN THO AT THIS HOUR IM NORMALLY HAL;F ASLEEP|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry capslock|pg||
nt|ady: 3@D    3NT   likely staert|pg||
nt|lestergold: Hallberg of course a legend and Ms.Senior one of the world's leading lady players|pg||
nt|lestergold: against the long standing partnerhsip of cooke and garvey|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: a blow for de botton|pg||
nt|daman: I have never heard of the legend and I subscribed to IPBM for years|pg||
mb|1S|nt|lestergold: er yes basically altho they still paly in some things|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: 2@C - THE MAJORS|pg||
nt|ralfwil: remaining @s from dummy and S is squeezed|pg||
nt|yo_yo: if 1NT is 15-18 why the delay?|pg||
nt|ady: not likely to make|pg||
nt|lestergold: Garvey a great bit slightly wild talent|pg||
nt|daman: I have heard of Nevena|pg||
mb|2D|an|hearts|mb|p|nt|mcarroll: "Interesting" a very broad term  |pg||
nt|yo_yo: i hope tony forrester doesnt shout at your son|pg||
nt|lestergold: Hallberg is a world class player|pg||
nt|daman: you said legend    he is not a legend|pg||
nt|daman: and I have a plethora of specs who agree|pg||
nt|lestergold: well a matter of opinion |pg||
mb|2S!|nt|roswolf: taking advantage of the vul|pg||
nt|sybarra: might end the 4/3 with X or 3 nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 2@H|pg||
nt|ady: Brunner not opening vul with a ragged suit|pg||
nt|yo_yo: who is East,  Bakhshi is in both rooms|pg||
nt|lestergold: n/sneeed to bid this tight vul 3N whoch as cards lie should make|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 2@C probably stayman|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I doubt N can make 3nt after a @s lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: Small max will accept the invite which is on the way|pg||
nt|daman: he might be a legend in GB|pg||
mb|4H|nt|garnetts: Not sure if NS use a 12-14 1NT --but even so I think this hand needs upgrading --too good for 15-17|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good morning to Ed Shapiro|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, everyone!|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi ED|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello Ed |pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: fantastic pass from West    winning action|pg||
mb|p|nt|blum1956: why not open weak 2@s? Or Multi? |pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes  12-14|pg||
nt|lestergold: er my son has a louder voice and is a lot bigger!|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: ok then very well known player :)|pg||
nt|daman: cool|pg||
nt|lestergold: he is originally from swedn and plays a great deal internationally especially the S|pg||
nt|lestergold: in the US|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You have never heard of Nevena Senior, George?|pg||
nt|pelu: but long way from US to Canada :)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|daman: Sure I have|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ralfwil: and for me a @s lead is natural as E|pg||
nt|lestergold: i c defence can establish 2 spades 2 clubs and a heart |pg||
nt|daman: sctoll up|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sybarra: should roll this one home,  not sure E can ever get in   |pg||
nt|roswolf: thyis looks like a make - west will be embarassed on the run of the minors|pg||
nt|lestergold: dim lead would let it thru|pg||
nt|daman: r*|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But you said you had not|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|haans: bidding today make them go to 3 level|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Strange lead|pg||
nt|garnetts: Likely think that it is too balanced and the suit is too weak at red|pg||
nt|sybarra: and clubs are 3/3 |pg||
nt|lestergold: am i seeing things here|pg||
nt|daman: scroll up|pg||
nt|Walddk4: oh, heard, sorry|pg||
pc|d8|nt|pelu: hi all|pg||
nt|blum1956: This leads to a probable disaster|pg||
nt|garnetts: Poor suit--more defensive than attacking|pg||
pc|d7|nt|daman: can't remember her maiden name|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dT|pg||
nt|daman: Demtinev or something like that|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Delova|pg||
nt|daman: hrrrrrmmmmm|pg||
mc|9|nt|mcarroll: Hi Peter|pg||
nt|lestergold: Townsend chos the  right time to pass but i would have thought an action with his big hand was noprmal like 3N|pg||
pg||
qx|c3|st||md|1SKQ962HK65DAJCQ95,ST4HAT7DKT9863CK2,SJ7HQDQ7542CJT863,SA853HJ98432DCA74|sv|e|nt|yo_yo: rotten start for the Hackett team|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed will be a test of their fortitude under pressure|pg||
nt|lestergold: I have seen Townsend pass in other auctions with massive hands where he should not have|pg||
nt|yo_yo: seems an odd pass to me|pg||
nt|daman: I have boxes of past issues of IPBM|pg||
nt|daman: delova doesn't ring a bell|pg||
nt|daman: yes    Deleva|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|garnetts: Both sides deserved to suffer for getting to 3NT--life is never fair lol|pg||
nt|yo_yo: the dreaded multi |pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: weak only version|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 11-15 at least  0  diamonds|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ady: sorry  seeing things  I tht diamonds 4-4 last hand|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but once again... if E had discarded @s6 he is discarding behind declarer|pg||
nt|lestergold: wellselway may take him seriously here and go too far|pg||
mb|2S|nt|Walddk2: Li Jie bid 5@D on his own next door|pg||
mb|4H|nt|Walddk2: Amazing auction really|pg||
nt|yo_yo: operator  can you explain the alerts?|pg||
nt|lestergold: hopwever  6@d is on ice|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 1@D   3@D   5@D  he bid. Partner was silent throughout|pg||
nt|sybarra: i guess you have to open that dog (4333)|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: will Gui give them 4@S?|pg||
nt|ady: well E/W do have 6@D|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh it worked they kept them out of the laydown slam |pg||
nt|daman: good stuff to reach game|pg||
pc|sK|nt|garnetts: I cannot see any reason to make 4@S  |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Denies 6 in a minor unless a 4-card major on the side|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@D can have 6 clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: Scores from first stanza|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup not a good 13 count but an opening within the meaning of the Act|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: Teltscher 86 Hackett 29, Senior 13 Rosen 49, Hinden 35 Small 41, Crouch 40 de Botton 52|pg||
nt|yo_yo: the multi does seem to work |pg||
nt|lestergold: 19 combined but work to do|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sJ|nt|yo_yo: 2@D presumably asks for the better major|pg||
nt|garnetts: Yes|pg||
nt|blum1956: this time 3NT looks slightly better|pg||
nt|garnetts: East sees no reason to do anything other than bid 3NT--things are well placed for 4@H--best lead from North though |pg||
nt|garnetts: I meant 4@H not 3NT sorry|pg||
nt|sybarra: with W do you lead low ht or q? |pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: Small should have good 6 to bad 8|pg||
nt|daman: needs to duck this|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2 top losers and 2 out  of 3 black losers in Hallberg's hand which need to be disposed of one way or the other|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|roswolf: well a good club view would help the cause of n/s|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|haans: had myself bid 4@C |pg||
nt|garnetts: might on a club lead even then not certain |pg||
nt|garnetts: I like 4@C as it helps partner to judge --but usually is shows more length doesn't it?  |pg||
nt|roswolf: Q in pards bid suit i think|pg||
nt|lestergold: at these colours there is a lot of equity in messing up the u]auction as n/s have done|pg||
pc|sT|nt|sybarra: this pickles you pard |pg||
pc|s7|nt|haans: we can talk about that :)|pg||
nt|pelu: no 4@C = fit to @D and values in @C|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|c4|nt|lestergold: a trump attack was needed|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: Sorry first time at this|pg||
nt|daman: he is gin for game|pg||
nt|daman: can make 5 really|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes he is lucky here can ruff 2 losers in dummy and just about negotiate |pg||
nt|daman: yes   maybe only makes 4    not enough soldiers for an overtrick|pg||
nt|lestergold: has to be careful when returning to hand ruffing the third@d|pg||
nt|lestergold: however has no choice as @da drops|pg||
nt|pelu: on @DK he can discard the last @S-loser - so give up 2 @Hs - but has to take @HA|pg||
mc|12|nt|garnetts: 4@S is very poorly disciplined |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Excellent judgement by Gui. 4@S is as dead as a dead chruch rat|pg||
nt|Walddk2: church  even|pg||
nt|garnetts: ask partner for a view and then ignore it--this hsould be a slam try sequence |pg||
nt|mcarroll: interesting metaphor|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Even if you guess hearts (you don't), it's 1 down|pg||
nt|sybarra: I lead the Q but who am I ?|pg||
nt|pelu: I dont beligve 12 - but 10!|pg||
nt|daman:     not 680|pg||
nt|lestergold: plus 1 i was expecting plus 2 imposs|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: Soryy result not right|pg||
nt|daman: maybe 620|pg||
nt|lestergold: 650 my guess|pg||
nt|pelu: 11 impossible|pg||
nt|daman: I think he has to lose a @S in the wash|pg||
nt|pelu: u cant place 3 black losers om two @Hs|pg||

nt|lestergold: Small is having a field day at the wheel|pg||
nt|yo_yo: mind you a weak 2 would have worked equally well |pg||
nt|lestergold: of course its no0t a victory for the multi as such merely a victory for the barrage that took place|pg||
nt|lestergold: or maybe a lowly trump promoted in south |pg||
nt|daman: 3NT for EW? |pg||
nt|daman: being aggressive?|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: SZ thinking about digging graves|pg||
nt|ady: part score here    likley 1NT e/w|pg||
nt|pelu: now the hand is scored as -1?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: -1 is right|pg||
nt|lestergold: which hand? the last?|pg||
nt|pelu: how?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|Walddk2: 5@H!? What a strange choice|pg||
nt|mcarroll: This mountain that SZ had to climb is suddenly taking on the appearance of Everest|pg||
nt|garnetts: Cannot think how West declared 5@H next door |pg||
nt|garnetts: I suppose that with the TOD west thought east had four |pg||
nt|daman: I think you might look at their card Nicky|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|Walddk2: This is funny. Yang psyched a pass over the Multi|pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 1,  e/w lost an imp here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Results from round 1: Rosen v Senior 25-4 ; Teltscher v P Hackett 19-11 ; Small v Hinden 17-13, and de Botton v Crouch 16-14|pg||
nt|daman: ask them the result|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: agressive non bidding|pg||
nt|garnetts: No auction given in the movie|pg||
mb|p|nt|blum1956: again the 3NT-4 Major choice|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: diamond lead beats this|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ralfwil: 4@h is better than 4@s. time enough to find the @c ruff|pg||
nt|lestergold: so the rosen team fresh from having given the senior team a serious pasting|pg||
nt|ady: wrong red suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: ht lead i predict|pg||
nt|daman: would we all have bid 3NT with 3334 9 count?|pg||
nt|daman: I have been told that -1 was claimed at the table|pg||
nt|lestergold: Hallberg still has his workl cut out for 9 tricks|pg||
nt|daman: from someone who is at the table|pg||
nt|lestergold: there are two tens i think normal to bid vul game at ips with west's hand|pg||
pc|hT|nt|daman: maybe she was swayed by her two 10's|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes a spade lead|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d2|nt|yo_yo: bakhshi has to alert  as he could have a longer @D suit|pg||
nt|ady: may get to 4@H    needs club lead  to definately beat it|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|Walddk2: 4@H also made in the other room on board 1, with an overtrick even|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|garnetts: this might beat it too|pg||
pc|s2|nt|haans: SZ scores :)|pg||
nt|pelu: I exp that the bidding in CR is so strange, that the operator dont wont to give it :)|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s9|nt|lestergold: @d switch good enuf?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: the teltscher team seemed to be way in front  yesterday|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|yo_yo: this will be a quick match|pg||
nt|lestergold: Halberg will make it with the help from the lead now|pg||
pc|d8|nt|lestergold: has time to try the club as well|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ady: spade lead also enough    only one discard of a club  so down 1|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|Walddk2: A spade was led to the ace and one returned. Curtains|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|s4|nt|daman: he almost has to fall into it now    no?|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|sybarra: was so much easier to beat the hand from this vantage point |pg||
pc|sK|nt|Walddk2: I am told that the contract was 6@C and not 5@H|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|roswolf: but after the great lead the follow-up was disappointing|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In the open room, Whittaker reasonably played partner for a singleton spade rather than @CA after West bid game|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Can't fault him|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|Walddk2: Anyway, something went 2 down|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c4|pc|c2|pg||
pc|d4|nt|garnetts: I am suprised to hear that :)  |pg||
pc|dT|pc|dK|nt|Walddk2: Whittaker also from Scotland originally|pg||

pc|c7|pc|s7|nt|daman: he will take the money and run|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h2|nt|Walddk2: Scotland "exported" many strong players, most notably Michael Rosenberg and Barnet Shenkin to USA|pg||
pc|hK|nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and Victor Silverstone, Irving Gordon, and a few others|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: Was 1 off, not making|pg||

mb|p|nt|garnetts: Well they got off to a very good lead and then made a fatal switch |pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: no, not clear|pg||
nt|yo_yo: if that's a weak 2 ...|pg||
nt|daman: nope  The Garve saved us from that|pg||
nt|lestergold: with garvey around you cant be sure|pg||
mb|2C|nt|garnetts: No--but the Q@C seemed a very rapid play |pg||
nt|blum1956: not an easy decision for North spade lead probably made from J10|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: apparently david gold still contemplating the @SA|pg||
nt|garnetts: In my view too fast to work out options |pg||
mb|2S!|nt|Walddk2: I can make 3NT here. Impressed?|pg||
nt|daman: 3 card drury?|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: a third in hand opening but 1nt looks bold at these colours and with a sketchy stop|pg||
nt|othered1: Agree|pg||
nt|lestergold: that is the wildness of garvey at unfavouravle vul he makes a bid that many of us wouldnt even do at favourable|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|haans: no :)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|daman: once you have a reputation...it is difficult to deviate|pg||
nt|lestergold: but he will get a plus score on this occasion for his efforts|pg||
nt|lestergold: cards lie very tamely|pg||
pc|hA|nt|Walddk2: You can't sit still with a 17 count|pg||
nt|yo_yo: a quick one down?|pg||
nt|lestergold: a push i expect|pg||
nt|ady: this should go ddown on the lay    3NT  may have mad with Q@D right though a an unlikely club lead would beat it|pg||
nt|yo_yo: the weak No trumpers might bid it 1NT - 3NT|pg||
pc|h9|nt|yo_yo: no a quick 2 down|pg||
nt|lestergold: a passive lead mind you would let it thru but unlikely|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|lestergold: work to do but the lead has created a trick and the spades are playabel for one loser|pg||
pc|h7|nt|pelu: yes Roland - and I can make 6 on a non-@c-lead :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: I would have been more impressed if you could have made 6@C on the last hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: well dangerous weak 2 with 6 solid tricks in ones hand|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hJ|nt|roswolf: blood will flow but whose it is not clear|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2NT asked East to choose a minor|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And Crouch knows that diamonds 5-0 now after the double|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He will play the hand accordingly|pg||
nt|sybarra: or maybe 4441 |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nah|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He would never double with that hand|pg||
nt|othered1: Mightn't he think north may be thinking that south had something for the vulnerable opening bid, even 3rd hand?|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry what amn i talking about 2 off|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|lestergold: hard for partner to read this|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT can only make on a spade lead which is likely|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ralfwil: yes and the side suit is @h!|pg||
nt|lestergold: even a @d trick may be created  as they lie|pg||
pc|h8|nt|haans: two yes for one no :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Crouch knows that Tosh has nothing. Otherwise North has no double|pg||
nt|sybarra: except with no @D lead, maybe shows S has none?|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes north cant be faulted but south will be ashamed|pg||
nt|othered1: Good pint, Shirley|pg||
nt|othered1: point|pg||
nt|roswolf: that is on the way|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Pint sounds OK|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe the pint is better at this hour for us|pg||
nt|sybarra: 940 am here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It may need a heart switch now|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed someone eill need a blood transfusion after this|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|yo_yo: @S lead would have beaten this |pg||
nt|yo_yo: ooops  Gold did return a low @S|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|d5|nt|garnetts: I was wondering what their methods were over 1NT  ---tempting to bid if you get both suits in |pg||
pc|d6|pc|dJ|nt|lestergold: that is a textbook error of course|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|c6|nt|yo_yo: another 13 imps to Teltscher|pg||
nt|lestergold: i dont think 3N is a likely spot here|pg||
nt|daman: Mike    I have noticed a marked imrpovement with your spelling    are you dating a Grammar teacher?    or are you just typing slower?    lol|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sybarra: E has to NOT play trumps |pg||
nt|Walddk2: If Crouch reads this, North can be endplayed to lead away from @HK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That is why a heart switch was needed at trick 2|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes cash out the side suits|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But he has to guess North's shape|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2 hearts and 3 clubs, or the other way round|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He is certain re diamonds|pg||
pc|c3|nt|yo_yo: 12 imps|pg||
nt|ralfwil: you are very kind Mike!|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i never heard of a weak 2  8-12|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|roswolf: assuming the 5-0 trump split playing clubs which is the natural thing to do will make the positiom clear|pg||
pc|d8|pc|d3|pc|d4|nt|daman: not at all like the old days|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|lestergold: well practice|pg||
nt|daman: hehehe|pg||
pc|cT|pc|c9|pc|c5|nt|roswolf: this may not be good enough|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|d7|nt|garnetts: On the last hand I really like the pass of 2@D --an intelligent psych |pg||
nt|lestergold: this doesnt make sense|pg||
nt|daman: tell us a bit about the 4some at the other table Mike|pg||
nt|lestergold: surely that club wasnt ducked by the defence|pg||
mc|7|nt|Walddk2: Now it is again|pg||
nt|roswolf: but that was a clear error by north|pg||
nt|sybarra: ace and a @H now?|pg||
nt|othered1: south did echo in @C|pg||
nt|sybarra: does that help?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Or a diamond to confirm the layout|pg||
nt|roswolf: north will be endplayed twice|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Then it is also easy|pg||
nt|othered1: And east's double of 2@S had to be on more than just the @HA|pg||
nt|roswolf: in either red suit - declarer's choice|pg||
pg||

nt|ady: grand slam time|pg||
nt|lestergold: well Brian senior and sandra penfold another formidable mixed partnership King a very respected player Small always appears in premier league and trials but would not rank him as ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: top ten in Uk|pg||
mb|1C|nt|haans: god slam here|pg||
nt|blum1956: perfect grand - will they find it?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and for me - never both majors|pg||
nt|daman: I think the score will sort itself out in the fullness of time|pg||
mb|2C|nt|daman: we need to cut Nicky some slack    this is her first time as a vugraph operator|pg||
nt|lestergold: Brian mainly known for his supremacy as a match point player world class|pg||
nt|daman: he is very good|pg||
nt|lestergold: but a very good player altogether|pg||
nt|daman: all pass?|pg||
nt|daman: or would you bid 2NT with the North hand?|pg||
nt|lestergold: senior of  course a very fine bridge journalist produces all the world championshiop reports excellent|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 5@D was a fine save against 6@C|pg||
nt|garnetts: If 2@H shows this then it might take a very short time to bid it |pg||
nt|sybarra: and great thinking as declarer,  didnt panic |pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed was my teammate in my Camrose match|pg||
nt|lestergold: Ive always foujhnd Small to be an undisciplined player at this level which ismperhaps why altho he is up there competing ion the premier league every year rarely m,akes it into the ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: top 4 if ever|pg||
nt|yo_yo: well  it was a weak @H suit |pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|garnetts: tough to get to 6@C but maybe not after that opening |pg||
nt|yo_yo: 16 opp  7   difficult|pg||
nt|blum1956: using the negative free style North should bid 2@h and then the life becomes easy|pg||
nt|ady: only 23 hcp   but great fit  and source of tricks|pg||
nt|yo_yo: splinter  or fit jump  or voidwood  which?|pg||
nt|blum1956: but NS probably do not use it|pg||
nt|blum1956: East is hoping to buy a contract for his side))|pg||
nt|yo_yo: does the X show @S?|pg||
mb|3H|nt|garnetts: yes --almost certainly spades with @D toleranace |pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@C  16+ unbalanced or 17+ balanced|pg||
nt|daman: hard to stop below game now|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: surely the dbl means more than "not penalty"!!|pg||
nt|yo_yo: they must have some more meaning than "not penalty"|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@D  0-7|pg||
nt|roswolf: this will show off the strong club system|pg||
mb|4S|nt|garnetts: might just bid 6@C and hope for the best |pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: or jump to 4@C GF|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why did North double over 2@C?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: *not double I mean|pg||
nt|yo_yo: another tough call for Michelle Brunner|pg||
nt|garnetts: When people used to play monet doubles --there were many times a psychic penaltry double was used--good time for it here for example :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: tradegy too as its frigid|pg||
nt|daman: it is gin|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Does that not show both red suits?|pg||
nt|haans: maybe better cards|pg||
nt|garnetts: like everyone else I have no idea what to do with hands like west--so might as well gamble|pg||
nt|othered1: There are 7's and there are 7's.  |pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1NT 17-19|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: this is not plain sailing|pg||
nt|lestergold: here we see Towsned can bid aggressively when he wants to|pg||
nt|lestergold: Im trying to work out can this be made double dummy even?|pg||
nt|lestergold: answer is i dont think that makes ten tricks as cardsw lie here|pg||
nt|yo_yo: difficult when the @S dont break|pg||
nt|lestergold: personally i think tiownsend overbid herec partner didnt even have tio have 4 reasonable,hearts|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Bakhshi knows the @S dont break from the bidding|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think 3@c expresses his values after the double|pg||
nt|yo_yo: most would bid 4@H |pg||
nt|lestergold: why?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 19 points? |pg||
nt|lestergold: west'shand is full of holes|pg||
nt|lestergold: 19 points opposie a pssoble yarborough maybe with a 3 card suit is not mandatory game|pg||
nt|lestergold: in either major|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ady: 4-2 spade split gives this an excellent play    would Bakhshi except an invitation ?|pg||
nt|pelu: for sure NS play Michael 5+/4+ - S has absolut minimum, but very friendly steup for N|pg||
pc|d4|nt|haans: now they know nothing|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Especially with the state of the match - harking back to the debate earlier about tactics|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not hard since North choose to bid 3@H--5NT will do it now |pg||
nt|blum1956: either exclusion Blackwood  (if NS use one) or just RKCB and hope for  the @dA with EW|pg||
nt|ady: disappointing|pg||
pc|d6|nt|haans: Pass forcing?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They have reached the par contract now, 6@DX|pg||
nt|garnetts: Not yet Roland |pg||
nt|garnetts: Very polite David |pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|mcarroll: He surely is not contemplating 6NT?|pg||
nt|garnetts: west is considering what to do|pg||
nt|lestergold: length is the paramountg consideration|pg||
pc|cK|nt|Walddk2: 3@D asking for a 5-card major|pg||
nt|othered1: and 3@D?  Puppet?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: so yes, Ed|pg||
nt|lestergold: Last year Cooke and Garvey were in the winning Camrose team which was I expect a culmination of their drwam for years|pg||
nt|daman: good for them|pg||
pc|c7|nt|othered1: North can likely infer that @S are 3-3 at most in EW  hands|pg||
pc|d5|nt|yo_yo: 5 small @H and a bust and it has a play|pg||
nt|lestergold: its a moot point borderline my point is that Towsend sholuld have consulted|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|Walddk2: Lucky that hearts are 3-3. He can test if @CJ10 doubleton first by cashing one of them|pg||
nt|lestergold: Garvey has always believed that he was the world's number one not noted for his modesty but to be fair i have always felt that he had a great talent for then game but in sufficent ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: discipline to sustain a position at the top table|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ady: but would he get the right result with a 4-2 spade split  if just consulting|pg||
pc|s8|nt|garnetts: trump next I imagine |pg||
nt|Walddk2: @CJ to indicate values in spades|pg||
nt|pelu: @cJ for @S|pg||
nt|garnetts: trump is best--the spade can wait |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Peter and I must have been partners|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|lestergold: a double followed by a 3 level cue bid tells pard that he doesnt need much to bid game posession ofa 5 CARD SUIT WOULD THEN BE HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT|pg||
nt|ady: I agree if east had just 3 small hearts and a bust then 4 hearts could cost a big number|pg||
nt|lestergold: Ssorry butterfingers this morning|pg||
nt|daman: we have our share of those on this side of the pond as well|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry slight exaggeration but we are allowed to tease garvey|pg||
pc|h2|nt|Walddk2: and will|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hA|nt|lestergold: a club away on that spade wouldnt hurt|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think selway should have played a club here a spade should have helped declarer|pg||
nt|daman: The Garve is not timid   he criticizes easily    lol|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|yo_yo: the winner of the 3 weekends gets to represent England in the Camrose |pg||
pc|cJ|nt|sybarra: if clubs 3/3,  this rolls |pg||
pc|c4|nt|sybarra: but oh well |pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is very good play|pg||
pc|d9|nt|blum1956: extremely strange bid for the player of Brunner's level|pg||
nt|lestergold: better not continue these!!|pg||
nt|lestergold: top diamond or even a trump by south would do|pg||
nt|lestergold: dont think bakhshi can set up a long dim and enjoy without losing trump comntrol|pg||
nt|ady: dont think it matters  if Townsend pulls 1 trumpt    can discard a club on K@S   and has time to ruff a spade and a club|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: hovering over a @h|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|garnetts: Poor South might be feeling a bit shell shocked after the start to this match---pressure gets to all of us |pg||
nt|lestergold: There are T shirts in circulation listing the world's top ten players Garvey at the top of course|pg||
pc|h5|nt|Walddk2: Then he just needs either hearts or clubs to behave|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|pc|h6|pg||
nt|lestergold: not designed by Gravey tho|pg||

pc|dK|pc|dT|pc|d2|pc|d3|pg||
nt|garnetts: what is there to think about? |pg||
pc|c6|nt|pelu: what to order for lunch :)|pg||
nt|daman: like wrestling with a python I imagine|pg||
nt|lestergold: but hes okay for a beer away from then table!!!|pg||
nt|pelu: if lose to @SQ then a @H-ruff - but he is lucky|pg||
nt|lestergold: well some of the bridge world'smore colourful characters Halberg is getting on form seventy buty i hear no one can beat him in an arm wrestle|pg||
nt|lestergold: Small not known for his sweetness and lightness either|pg||
pc|sA|nt|sybarra: hts behave |pg||
pc|hJ|nt|Walddk2: and spades 4-3 of course|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|sK|nt|lestergold: Cooke is of  course a world class pojker player|pg||

nt|ady: other than bid 2@H  if their system allows I dont think Holland do much about  it   Brunner needs to do a lot more|pg||

mb|3C|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: first weekend of 3|pg||

mb|3N|nt|haans: SZ coming|pg||
nt|garnetts: Tough hand for North --|pg||
nt|yo_yo: redouble is for blood i think|pg||
nt|garnetts: Double now look fine |pg||
nt|blum1956: EW probably catched up|pg||
nt|garnetts: yes xx was punitive|pg||
nt|sybarra: singleton honors worth ?  (zip)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Mike Bell also passed 3@D in the OR on 2|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I like Gan's choice of 1NT in the closed room, rather than double|pg||
nt|garnetts: Anyone for 1NT on the West cards raher then dbl? |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Jxx often a nice holding|pg||
nt|pelu: diff to see the @H-stop in 3Nt - in CR West reopen 1NT - so......|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: The 470 was worth 8 IMPs, 110 at the other table|pg||
nt|yo_yo: very odd|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: I like 1NT a lot more--because I hate double |pg||
nt|garnetts: If North doubles South might lead the K@H |pg||
nt|garnetts: Very well done by John here |pg||
nt|blum1956: was West's double of 1NT strong or 1-suiter? Probably strong|pg||
nt|blum1956: otherwise East shoud not pass by 2@c|pg||
nt|garnetts: I did not like the 2@D bid--why not just pass and leave it to partner?  Unless it showed a desire to play in 1NT xx|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i dont think you have to alert a penalty double of 1NT|pg||
nt|yo_yo: but other penalty doubles are now alertable|pg||
nt|garnetts: West double was penalty oriented I am fiarly sure |pg||
nt|garnetts: essential to have that option against 12-14 0r weaker |pg||
nt|blum1956: anyway EW are in serious trouble|pg||
nt|lestergold: note that the absence of a 7th club does not deter the Garve from a vul 3 level pre=empt|pg||
pc|c7|nt|othered1: Looks like 3N doesn'thave much play at all on @H lead.|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @S raising @D?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i wish i understood this bidding|pg||
nt|lestergold: slam looks well below 59%|pg||
nt|lestergold: well 2¬@h doesnt mke|pg||
nt|ady: North decided to keep out of bidding     not unreasonable|pg||
nt|daman: I have an appointment in 10 minutes    so I will have to flee this match at that point|pg||
nt|pelu: 6 or 7? - as long as the suit is QJ109xx|pg||
nt|lestergold: however his cheeky opening has pushed e/w into  a pretty hpel;ess 3n|pg||
nt|pelu: woprked foine here - no chance in 3NT|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ady: west considering 3@C   not an immediate success|pg||
nt|blum1956: perfect lead!|pg||
pc|c9|nt|pelu: only 2@D on 14 HCP???????????????|pg||
nt|sybarra: Simon Cope says:  no - relay shape ask I am pretty sure|pg||
nt|lestergold: 60%|pg||
nt|lestergold: 50% i mean|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s3|nt|mcarroll: I agree, especially when you see where double leads to|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6 losers unavoidable|pg||
pc|sT|nt|othered1: The double may help NS here.  Why double when you are quite likely on lead?|pg||
nt|sybarra: S would love to have the ace to send it back |pg||
nt|Walddk2: I said it before and I will say it again. The EBU must require that all convention cards are submitted and then put on display on the website. It is unreasonable that commentators ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: must guess what certain bids mean|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I'll have a word with Max Bavin|pg||
nt|othered1: Agree|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|garnetts: I would rather have passed the double than bid 2@D |pg||
nt|haans: original bid|pg||
pc|c5|nt|sybarra: I have found that the cc's typically posted are only part of the story,  but would be nice|pg||
nt|yo_yo: nice lead for King|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lestergold: I must admit i would not have preotected with halberg's hand altho h ewas influnced by holding 9 cards in the majors|pg||
pc|d4|nt|sybarra: (also in little tiny print) |pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's a miracle that I have the EW card. I have because Crouch sent it to me|pg||
nt|othered1: Most don't get terribly deep into relay development|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It took me 5 minutes to download the comprehensive version of the EW CC|pg||
nt|sybarra: the cc's hardly give the details for relays,  agree ED |pg||
nt|Walddk2: There is also a shorter version I have on hand|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|haans: i would have tried 3@D :)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|blum1956: ruff out, play trumps and then a spade|pg||
pc|s4|nt|garnetts: Yes of course Haans :) rofl |pg||
nt|mcarroll: I would have tried 2@H with the E hand|pg||
nt|garnetts: Roland explained to me that out operators are new to this and it is very tought job--in my view Darren is doing brilliantly so far --may not be able to note all alerts this first ...|pg||
nt|garnetts: time |pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: Cheers, I am new but Roger is an old hand, you'll have David and Ant later who are both experts!|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|lestergold: making 5|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|garnetts: Roland and I would have been in 3NT because we would have bid 1NT as west --so there |pg||
nt|lestergold: the downside of going for a number would have detered me|pg||
nt|pelu: but some would pass the X - if pd strong then 500-800 |pg||
pc|d2|nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 11 imps about to appear for the Teltscher team|pg||
nt|roswolf: this isnt favorite|pg||
nt|sybarra: take no finesses|pg||

nt|reisig: Somehow - I get partners that remind me!!|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dK|pc|d7|pg||
nt|lestergold: long dim takes care of one club loser but that is still 1 off|pg||
nt|lestergold: no devils coup available|pg||
nt|ady: this may be down 2    but definately 1  so nothing much lost for n/s being kept out of the bidding|pg||
