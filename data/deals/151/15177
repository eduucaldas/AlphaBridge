pc|h5|nt|odysseus69: no not a board a match - over 11 boards each pair is competing gainst a specific pair from the other team|pg||

mb|r|mb|1H|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|odysseus69: sure to make 6D - but can they get there|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North has a huge hand now after the 3@D jump |pg||
nt|odysseus69: and not bid grand|pg||
mb|3H|mb|p|mb|3S|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 3@S likely a fragment-style bid, as South did not bid 1@S over 1@H |pg||
mb|4H|nt|rmb1: 3@S is just showing a stop (of sorts) for 3NT,  Does not know North is making slam tries.|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|mb|p|mb|5H|mb|p|nt|odysseus69: few undos to correct|pg||
mb|6D|nt|mdgraham: does now....|pg||
mb|p|mb|6N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|odysseus69: club lead still not good enough|pg||
nt|rmb1: In a less confident partnership, South would have let North play in hearts by now :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North not content with 6@D at pairs. But a club lead may be interesting  |pg||
nt|odysseus69: sure to make after the take out double|pg||
nt|odysseus69: west will be thrown in to concede 2 spade tricks|pg||
nt|rmb1: I guess there is a strip squeeze on a club lead|pg||
pc|c3|nt|odysseus69: also could duck and squeeze as long as he reads distribution-not a problem either way |pg||
pc|cJ|nt|mdgraham: the t/o double places virtually all the high cards - just room for East to hold @SJ perhaps|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c6|pg||
nt|rmb1: Doesn't duck and squeeze require West to have @SJ, which is only card he might not have|pg||
nt|odysseus69: no - spade jack not relevant|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mdgraham: although West may reduce to a singleton K in spades - but North will get it right  |pg||
nt|rmb1: The plan is for south to have SQx and winning diamond, and North to have SAx and C10.  |pg||
nt|dimi: Nunes has to hold @c K and @s K, so there is no chance to escape the squeeze|pg||
nt|odysseus69: N/S areboth Jill- North Jill Levin -now corrected-wife of Bobby Levin|pg||
pc|dT|nt|rmb1: When South cashes the diamond, either the C10 or SQ will become a winner|pg||

mb|p|mb|p|mb|1C|mb|p|mb|1H|nt|mdgraham: looks like Fantoni-Nunes are playing their own system|pg||
mb|d|an|4+spades|nt|rmb1: 1@C is 14+ with clubs or 15+ BAL, F|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 9 tricks in hearts and a struggle for 9 in spades -|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|d|mb|p|nt|odysseus69: as is the modern style aggressive bidding all round|pg||
nt|rmb1: 1@H is a transfer 0-11 4 @S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so 1@h shows spades. Good here for double  to be take-out of the shown suit|pg||
mb|3D|mb|3H|mb|3S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|odysseus69: cant understand Fantoni double|pg||
