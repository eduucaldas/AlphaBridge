nt|odysseus69: welcome to the Buffet cup - the formatt seeks to follow the Ryder cup|pg||
nt|dimi: good morning Victor|pg||
nt|odysseus69: for the first stage each pair is matched against a specific pair from the other side- the matched pairs sit in the same direction and play against the other pairs from the opposing ...|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|mb|2C|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: Good afternoon all|pg||
nt|jcwla: Welcome to the Miskin Manor hotel, near Cardiff in Wales, for the 3rd edition of the Warren Buffett Bridge Cup. This contest has the concept of golfs Ryder Cup and is scheduled to ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: coincide, as closely as possible, with it. |pg||
nt|psridhar: hi all welcome :)|pg||
mb|2H|nt|jcwla: The competing teams, from Europe and the United States, consist of 12 players each and include one Womens pair and five Open pairs.|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: For Europe, NPC Paul Hackett of England has selected Sabine Auken & Daniela von Arnim, Germany, Boye Brogeland & Erik Saelensminde, Geir Helgemo & Tor Helness, Norway, Giorgio ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: Duboin & Antonio Sementa, Fulvio Fantoni & Claudio Nunes, Italy, and Jason & Justin Hackett, England.|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|jcwla: For the USA, NPC Donna Compton has chosen David Berkowitz & Alan Sontag, Bob Hamman & Zia Mahmood, Bobby Levin & Steve Weinstein, Jill Levin & Jill Meyers, Jeff Meckstroth & Eric ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: Rodwell, and Geoff Hampson & Fred Gitelman.|pg||
nt|jcwla: The competition includes Pairs, Teams and an Individual. All events are scored at Board-A-Match (Point-A-Board). In this form of scoring, there are only 3 scores available: a win, ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: a tie and a loss. Any difference in the score, no matter how small, decides the board. We will have 6 tables in play at all times.|pg||
mb|p|mb|3D|mb|p|nt|jcwla: Essentially, this becomes Super-Matchpoints: every overtrick, every undertrick, the difference between playing in No Trump versus a Major may decide the board.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@D is constructive|pg||
nt|jcwla: For simplicity, we are using the European style of 2 points for a win, 1 point for a tie and 0 points for a loss.|pg||
nt|jcwla: We are starting with the Pairs competition. Each pair has drawn a pair from the other team, with whom their scores will be compared.  Each pair will play an 11-board match against ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: each of the remaining five pairs from the opposing team.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: note South's response on a 1-count |pg||
nt|jcwla: Next up will be the Teams competition. The captains assign each pair to one of three teams. They will play a double round-robin of 14-board rounds, for a total of six matches.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Finally, we will have the Individual. Each player has drawn a player from the other team, with whom their scores will be compared. Each player partners each of the other eleven ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: players on their team for a short set (6 boards) against various partnerships from the other team.  Each team has agreed on a standard convention card for this event.|pg||
mb|p|nt|jcwla: The overall competition is scored at "Buffett Points". Each match/set from each event has been assigned a point value, based on the number of boards involved. The Pairs and Teams ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: will have 4 BPs at stake for each match; the Individual will have 2 BPs at stake for each match.|pg||
nt|jcwla: This leaves 60 Buffett Points to be contested for the Pairs, 72 for the Teams and 66 for the Individual. With 198 total BPs at stake, the first team to 100 points wins the trophy. ...|pg||
nt|jcwla: If the teams tie with 99 BPs each, Europe, as holders, will retain the Cup.|pg||

mb|p|nt|Gerben42: Hampson shows that Dbl does not promise 4-card @S|pg||
pc|c2|nt|Gerben42: Brogeland was surprisingly passive|pg||
nt|athene: I guess he decided that spades were unlikely to be a good trump suit for his side after the double.|pg||

nt|daman: Levin ducked the @D lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|dimi: is it a board a match event?|pg||

mb|d|nt|psridhar: thats difficult to comprehend dia duck|pg||
mb|1S|nt|rmb1: Board-a-match throughout|pg||
nt|drewsky: USA is up quite a bit now...does anyone know how much ?|pg||
mb|3D|nt|odysseus69: no not a board a match - over 11 boards each pair is competing gainst a specific pair from the other team|pg||
nt|odysseus69: dont know who is playing weak NT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Fantoni-Nunes, I think |pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|xenya: 28-20 i heard|pg||
pc|sA|nt|jcwla: With all that said, hi Mike.  Looks like a very good result for Europe on Board 1.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you need the 1NT in "sandwich" position to be natural against this EW pair. They open and respond very light. |pg||
nt|daman: weak Smolen|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mdgraham: Hi Jordan|pg||
nt|mdgraham: On the last board, East may be weak with a long suit. Lebensohl comes in handy (2NT puppets 3@C, then you can bid your long suit). A diretc bid shows reasonable values.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|psridhar: Brogeland seq asks for pd to pick a 2 level major nf|pg||

nt|daman: @C tap right away|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s5|pc|s3|nt|mdgraham: So West wasn't flying solo when he bid 3NT.|pg||
nt|psridhar: that attacking lead will tap decl trumps, but decl may not mind scoring his little trumps in a dummy reversal manner|pg||
nt|daman: West has to get the @Ss moving|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
pc|d8|nt|odysseus69: looks like 8 tricks i|pg||

nt|lml: hi :)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|mdgraham: possible auction here -  3NT-6@D|pg||
nt|jcwla: In the OR, same start to the auction, but Brogeland did not move over N's 1NT, so a win to USA there.|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: goodish is a new word to me|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|3S|nt|odysseus69: sure to make 6D - but can they get there|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North has a huge hand now after the 3@D jump |pg||
nt|odysseus69: and not bid grand|pg||
mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 3@S likely a fragment-style bid, as South did not bid 1@S over 1@H |pg||
nt|daman: Some pairs play DOPI for controls over opposition to their 2@C opening|pg||
nt|daman: he might get squeezed if he doesn't take his 2@Hs|pg||
nt|daman: but there is the issue of transportation|pg||
nt|daman: and N can hold the @Ss|pg||
nt|psridhar: decl has 10 top tricks and will need to play h to get his 11th|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: 3@S is just showing a stop (of sorts) for 3NT,  Does not know North is making slam tries.|pg||
nt|daman: if East had AK10 of @S there would be a shot  |pg||
pc|d9|nt|psridhar: now decl is a tempo behind -likely only 430|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d4|nt|mdgraham: no 1@S overcall - mildly surprising|pg||

nt|psridhar: cl are 5-0|pg||

pc|s6|nt|mdgraham: does now....|pg||
pc|s8|pc|sA|pg||
nt|xenya: i think he can make 11 now|pg||
nt|lml: 5 i think after that good guess|pg||
nt|lml: yes|pg||
nt|xenya: losing a @D and a @S|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cA|pc|c4|nt|odysseus69: club lead still not good enough|pg||
nt|rmb1: In a less confident partnership, South would have let North play in hearts by now :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North not content with 6@D at pairs. But a club lead may be interesting  |pg||
nt|odysseus69: sure to make after the take out double|pg||
nt|odysseus69: west will be thrown in to concede 2 spade tricks|pg||
nt|rmb1: I guess there is a strip squeeze on a club lead|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|odysseus69: also could duck and squeeze as long as he reads distribution-not a problem either way |pg||
nt|xenya: now he has to get @H right as well|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mdgraham: the t/o double places virtually all the high cards - just room for East to hold @SJ perhaps|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|xenya: for 11|pg||
pc|sK|nt|rmb1: Doesn't duck and squeeze require West to have @SJ, which is only card he might not have|pg||
nt|odysseus69: no - spade jack not relevant|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|mdgraham: although West may reduce to a singleton K in spades - but North will get it right  |pg||
nt|rmb1: The plan is for south to have SQx and winning diamond, and North to have SAx and C10.  |pg||
nt|dimi: Nunes has to hold @c K and @s K, so there is no chance to escape the squeeze|pg||
nt|odysseus69: N/S areboth Jill- North Jill Levin -now corrected-wife of Bobby Levin|pg||
nt|lml: yes it may be quite tempting to play hearts the wrong way|pg||
pc|h9|nt|rmb1: When South cashes the diamond, either the C10 or SQ will become a winner|pg||
nt|jcwla: I'd say very surprising, meanwhile a great result for Europe here.|pg||
nt|lml: since it is safer that way|pg||

nt|athene: but it would have risked going down|pg||

nt|athene: diamond lead, spade finesse, club shift from north|pg||
mb|1D!|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|1S|mb|3H|mb|4S|nt|athene: 4@S looks good here - only 500 isn't it?|pg||
nt|athene: this is a situation where point-a-board and MP are very different from imps|pg||
nt|Gerben42: good timing for max. pressure|pg||
nt|athene: at imps you just take the money|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes 500 against 650! in this format of scoring these deccisions have to be very close|pg||
nt|athene: 4@SX rather than risking 5@H|pg||
nt|athene: because going one off in 5@H is a huge disaster|pg||
nt|athene: you are prepared to settl for a sure 500|pg||
nt|athene: but here, +500 is just as bad as -100, if they are making 620 or 650 in the other room|pg||

mb|4D|nt|drewsky: Many partnerships play that 4 of a aminor here by west is NOT a slam try.....|pg||

mb|p|nt|odysseus69: as is the modern style aggressive bidding all round|pg||
nt|rmb1: 1@H is a transfer 0-11 4 @S|pg||

pc|s7|nt|odysseus69: no problems here with 2 out of 3 finesses right and no bad breaks|pg||
nt|mdgraham: useful here to have two raises over the double - a good raise and a weak raise. It looks like EW have no such agreement|pg||

nt|athene: i am going mad|pg||
nt|athene: so concede a heart right away looks normal; see what happens|pg||

nt|vugraphzrd: Declarer apologiseing saying "this will take some time"|pg||
nt|vugraphzrd: Especially as the 10 can "quite often be from a short suit"|pg||
