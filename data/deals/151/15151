mb|1C!|mb|p|mb|1H!|an|!s|nt|tomi2: Grosset and Ruso are two junior players, he is from France, she from Croatia, send me private msg if you know, how this partnership came together :)|pg||
nt|blum1956: hi all|pg||
mb|d|nt|jcwla: Hi all.|pg||
mb|1N!|mb|p|mb|2H!|mb|p|mb|2S!|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|tomi2: when both opps sugest NE, Ruso might better lead her own suit?|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: *NT|pg||
pc|h8|nt|tomi2: hope for then they have agreed what they lead from xx and xxx|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|blum1956: 25 HCP but all of them are bad. South is right to prefere 3NT. At least the defence must switch to diamonds now|pg||
nt|jcwla: Doesn't sound like decl has a lot of @D cards...|pg||
nt|tomi2: Grosset might be tempted to think lead may be from 3 small and duck ths|pg||
nt|blum1956: 4@s is down unconditionally|pg||
nt|tomi2: maybe they open 1@C even with 4 dias on a bal. hand|pg||
nt|blum1956: W must deduce that his parnter should have supported hearts on 2nd level having 3 hearts|pg||
nt|blum1956: After this the defence is easy|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Good afternoon all|pg||

nt|blum1956: 3 off|pg||
nt|mdgraham: was 1@h over 1@C showing spades?|pg||
nt|jcwla: Well the lead should tell the whole story, should not lead high from three of pd's bid and unsupported suit.|pg||
nt|jcwla: Hi Mike.|pg||
nt|blum1956: yes|pg||
nt|jcwla: Meanwhile 4@S only off b/c of placement of @SK.|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d4|pc|d9|pc|dQ|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s9|pc|s2|pc|s7|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|jcwla: To the extent N has some @C cards, the double fit and 8-card @S holding argues strongly for @S.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: interesting, then - popular in England is to rebid 1N with 2 cards, complete the 1-level transfer with 3, and jump to the 2-level with 4 |pg||
mc|10|nt|blum1956: of coarse 4@s is better looking on tne NS cards? but on this particulsr board 3NT had a better chance|pg||
nt|jcwla: Cue up Joe Cocker -- N getting by with a little help from his friends...|pg||

nt|tomi2: maybe @DT would be a better switch than small?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you are off @HAK and @DA in 4@s, so it's no great shakes - if North shows about 12-14 and three spades South might pack it in right there  |pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|nt|jcwla: But also lower downside risk in @S if it is off -- meanwhile there will undoubtedly be some discussion btn. E and W at a later time.|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Read above :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: err, sorry, yes, misread|pg||
nt|Walddk2: She prefers Blue Club|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hello everyone|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2: "Consus" is something, that I saw often in Poland but should be much more all over the world. In other countries single persons are sponsor of teams, here they have found some ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: multinational company that runs a bridge team!|pg||

nt|xenya: hello everyone|pg||
nt|petergill: Hi Hedy|pg||
nt|vugraphzqn: welcome Hedy :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: We will be starting with boards 7 and 8 in this room, followed by comparisons from the other table when we circle back to board 1|pg||
nt|peachy: Results after Round 3:  http://www.crobridge.com/pula/eng/|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzqn: hii all...welcome back to Pula...|pg||
nt|athene: hi good evening everyone|pg||
nt|athene: 4@S should be reached here i think|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Multi defence, 1 major|pg||
nt|athene: spade finesse through the 1nt opener|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hi Peter and Vladimir|pg||
nt|petergill: Hi Roland, Vladimir|pg||
mb|1C|an|!|nt|rv: Hi Tomislav, continue great work|pg||

nt|vugraphzqn: ...hii all...welcome back to Pula...|pg||
nt|vugraphzqn: ...good evenin to all...|pg||
nt|vugraphzqn: evening :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: EW do indeed play Blue Club I am told|pg||
nt|fabsayc: with double fit east can bid 2nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: well that looks strong|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@C  17+|pg||
nt|xenya: Hi Peter and Roland|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and hi to our operator, Tomislav|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Polish Club presumably|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1. 12-14 balanced - 2. 15+ with clubs - 3. Any 18+|pg||
mb|1H|nt|peachy: Hello Tomislav and Bill|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good evening to Arno Lindermann|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We will be starting with boards 7 and 8 in this room, followed by comparisons from the other table when we circle back to board 1|pg||
nt|Walddk2: N-S from Croatia, E-W from Austria|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|an|!|nt|tomi2: Consus is trading with CO2 emission rights and sponsor a whole Bridge team, like vodafone sponsors manchester united|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Used to, they don't any more|pg||
nt|Walddk2: MU have AON now|pg||
nt|henryb:  East would have done best to pass 3@cX|pg||
nt|rv: not my chice of double with aceless hand opp a passed partner|pg||
nt|arno11: hi everyone|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphpl2: gajcyk wypytuje o licytacje|pg||
nt|brolucius: If they are playing Polish Club, 1@C may be a strong hand but is more likely to be based on a weak 1NT (if they rebid 1NT).|pg||
nt|roswolf: 4@H maybe?|pg||
nt|roswolf: here definitely strong!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's not necessarily strong. Polish Club 1@C is ... 1. 12-14 balanced (often) - 2. 15+ with clubs - 3. Any 18+ hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: all friendly as it should be so this will make easily|pg||
nt|petergill: This lead attacks the entry to dummy's clubs |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good afternoon to Arno Lindermann from Austria|pg||
nt|arno11: hi everybody|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Arno|pg||
nt|vugraphzqn: hii comentators, hii Roland, hii kibs...welcome all..|pg||
nt|petergill: She Goes To Bed at 8pm leads the event with Zweili 2nd|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@C shgows the 18+ hand and denies as much as 3 hearts|pg||
nt|hedyg: how would he show 15+ with @cs?|pg||
mb|2N|nt|roswolf: true|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is 3.|pg||
nt|arno11: well done by EW|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes it is. Always difficult to bid a game when an opponent opens a strong NT|pg||
nt|peachy: But once you get there, only few if any guesses, when one opp is know to have strong NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: Good evening all.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: all routes lead to 4@S it seems|pg||
nt|petergill: M Czerepak used to partner Marek Markowski who has for many years been npc of Polish youth teams|pg||
mb|3N|nt|peachy: Welcome to Mike Graham, from England|pg||
nt|athene: you might expect NS to lock into spades after the 1@S opener, with south having three|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@D is 0-7|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes i agree, but italian style takeout double lands on feet once again|pg||
nt|roswolf: agreed rv|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: West decides he is not worth anything stronger than 4@H (such as 4@C, splinter) because East limited his hand with the 1@D response.|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: and a diamond switch!?|pg||
nt|tomi2: they send two teams to Pula it seems. North is Krzystof Martens, he wrote several books in the past years, if you are an advanced or expert player and want to improve your game, ...|pg||
nt|tomi2: think about his books|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, they have a better fit in hearts :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 15 and 16 first, followed by comparisons from the other table when we circle back to board 9|pg||
nt|petergill: South will duck|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|henryb:  3@c goes down 4, which is even better than the lucky slam|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Walddk2: 1@S can still be a weak NT and is forcing|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@H obviously confirms the 18+ hand|pg||
pc|s7|nt|roswolf: yes the italians have a lot to answer for|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Down 1 not too bad, N-S can make some diamonds|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|peachy: The other commentators for this match are Bill Frisby, England, and Raija Davis USA|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|peachy: declare needs to pay spades for one loser. Or else get rid of a diamond loser, to make|pg||
nt|athene: i would just transfer and then bid 3nt with that west hand|pg||
nt|petergill: I think declarer should win @SA, then play a @D before the clubs|pg||
pc|cA|nt|petergill: in order to try for the 9th trick early, in case the defence can cash 4 @Hs and 1 @D|pg||
pc|c4|nt|roswolf: trump is even better|pg||
nt|petergill: NS playing upside down count|pg||
pc|c3|nt|arno11: Iris Gr√ºmm has always been a member of the austrian ladies team in recent years, Stefan is a former junior internationalist, both in their late twenties|pg||
nt|athene: maybe south thought his partner showed two hearts rather than four|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|cK|nt|rv: this rates to be 1 down, can NS manoeur a @c ruff as well, now unlikely|pg||
nt|mdgraham: defence will get a spade ruff, but to no avail|pg||
nt|athene: no way to beat this - east could start with the spade lead but then if he tried underleading the club for a second ruff he would be sadly disappointed|pg||
nt|athene: i don't think you want to offer clubs with a minimum 5422|pg||
pc|c8|nt|roswolf: indeed but east took a normal view i think|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you cant stand a 2D response and a huge chunk of your stuff is in their suit -- a defensive hand-type when they open 1S really|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Oh well, they are getting too many trump tricks now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We all agree re the double|pg||
nt|petergill: Nice play of heart to ten|pg||
nt|arno11: EW are Iris Gr√ºmm and Stefan Jerolitsch both in their late twenties, Iris is a steady competitor for the austrian ladies team and Stefan is a former junior internationalist|pg||
nt|arno11: I guess NS are of the same age, maybe even younger|pg||
nt|vugraphzqn: N-S 26,28...|pg||
nt|petergill: Is South Ben Handley-Pritchard? If so, he used to play in England Junior (U26) team about 8 years ago |pg||
nt|arno11: http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=3308   Iris|pg||
nt|vugraphzqn: yes scrote i Ben Handley_pritchard|pg||
pc|c5|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|tomi2: As far as I remember this Consus squad won Australian Nationals earlier this year|pg||
nt|henryb:  At this vulnerability, I think you either have to look for slam or defend|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I agree- prospects of 6@C probably remote|pg||
nt|athene: and 5@C is very rarely going to be better than 3nt|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.pzbs.pl/wyniki/turnieje/2010/pula/team/pulateamleaderb.html  for running scores|pg||
nt|hedyg: now @D?|pg||
nt|petergill: A @d now, before any meaningful defensive discards, is recommended |pg||
pc|d5|pc|d3|nt|roswolf: but with 4 cards in the other major not too yucky|pg||
nt|marlowepi: both red is the worst conditions for this double -- both sides might go down in hundreds|pg||
nt|arno11: http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=13996 Stefan|pg||
nt|petergill: NS team name is "She Goes to Bed at 8pm"|pg||
pc|dK|nt|Walddk2: There is a first time for everything, all 4 commentators agree|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.msc.com.pl/cezar/index.php?s=&mycl=0&tmt=5&p=21&r=5739&s_r=0&s_nz=nowicki&s_off=0  for a picture of Nowicki|pg||
nt|athene: if north actually had a diamond ruff coming, and four hearts, it might be sensible to show THREE hearts|pg||
nt|athene: then there's no chance south will try to give a heart ruff rather than a diamond ruff|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|vugraphpl2: spodziewana dyskusja|pg||
nt|roswolf: :)|pg||
nt|petergill: M Czerepak follows Hedy's and my lead|pg||
pc|cT|pc|d4|nt|Walddk2: yes, and not "bad" :)|pg||
pc|c6|nt|henryb:  I do not think they can beat this|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|c7|pc|s8|nt|henryb:  especially with partners who are not particular about distribution when making takeout doubles|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe she is too|pg||
pc|c9|nt|henryb:  But declarer can go down|pg||
nt|jbgood: well, another heart now|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup and probably has|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|rv: yes, I have seen it happen too often in my stints on BBO Vugraph, the more we have lesser the chance we all agree:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And now club, then 2 down|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|roswolf: definitely has|pg||
pc|h3|nt|arno11: http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=3464   Ben|pg||
nt|xenya: I think She Goes To Bed... is a motley team, consisting of players from Croatia, England and France |pg||
nt|petergill: If @HA was onside and clubs not 2-2, then declarer can make 3@D's and 3NT by playing on @d's first, but might go down by playing clubs first|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d7|pg||
nt|othered1: Some prefer to bid their shapes out rather than just rebid 3N on 5-4-2-2- hands.  Matter of style, but not unheard of.|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|pc|h4|pc|s6|pg||
nt|jbgood: he would have maed it by ruffing a di, then another spade. If N ruffs in, the di loser goes away|pg||
nt|jbgood: or a club loser|pg||
nt|henryb:  Should have taken his 10 tricks: three side winners, five trumps in hand and two club ruffs|pg||
pc|hT|nt|marlowepi: i rarely even agree with myself, let alone three other commentators|pg||
nt|athene: you might bid this way with a really concentrated 5-4 but here with the ace outside, it feels like a balanced hand to me|pg||
nt|vugraphzqn: N sad something about reading Es book....befor start...:)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|Walddk2: http://www.crobridge.com/pula/eng/  for the festival website|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|roswolf: probably will cost a couple of imps|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|jbgood: but to get the five trump tricks in hand he needed to play another spade from dummy|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|pc|h6|nt|henryb:  North needed to return the @dJ, not the trump|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|s5|pc|sT|nt|xenya: all under 29, i've been told|pg||
nt|arno11: and here we also have the N player : http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=24213 |pg||

nt|roswolf: perhaps|pg||
nt|roswolf: did someone pull out a plug?rehi all|pg||
nt|roswolf: this might get feisty|pg||
nt|fabsayc: bidding strongly suggested 4 hearts with declarer where not possible|pg||
nt|Walddk2: E-W play Blue Team Club, a rare bid nowadays|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Did you play that ever, Peter?|pg||
nt|petergill: When Ben H-P played in the England junior team in 2002 at Torquay for the European Junior Championships, Ben's partner Richard Probst met his Croatian wife Sandra (Kulovic?). Both ...|pg||
nt|petergill: Ben and Richard were very humorous and witty when I met them at that event. |pg||
nt|Walddk2: *bird I meant to say|pg||
nt|petergill: Another way of looking at it: there are 3 extra @D tricks available by playing @d's first, and only 2 or 3 extra club winners to me made by playing clubs first, therefore play on ...|pg||
nt|petergill: @d's at Trick 2|pg||
nt|petergill: Pula in Croatia is very popular, and this event has a very good reputation|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: suits aren splitting friendly in this hand|pg||
nt|athene: most people would open the north hand 1@S - 2@S is ok if that's what it shows|pg||
nt|othered1: that's a normal result, if east doesn't make the non-restricted choice decision had north played @SJ on second round.|pg||
nt|athene: well, people treat 6-4 as a 1-suiter, sometimes|pg||
nt|arno11: EW are using a kind of Blue Club system, so strong club  4 card majors and canap√© (shorter suit first in some situations)|pg||
mb|2C|an|strong|nt|athene: how loudly can east pass 1@S?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The East hand before could not be bid accurately after the 1@H response as 2@D woulkd be artificial. 2@C was in theory 6+ clubs and 15+ points, but he had to lie a little|pg||
nt|hedyg: tststs|pg||
mb|3H|nt|vugraphzqn: ...sry all..lost conection..:(|pg||
nt|roswolf: aggressive opening by north|pg||
nt|peachy: in light opening style, North will open|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@D showing diamonds, a rare bird on this side of the pond|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's as good as anything in my view|pg||
nt|petergill: I played Blue Club for about 2 months. |pg||
nt|arno11: EW are playing canap√© style, but only by opener, strong club with control responses by step, kind of BLue CLub|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@C is 17+|pg||
nt|Walddk2: with control responses I assume|pg||
nt|arno11: as iti is still played in Austria but becoming less popular|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: if they bid 6@S (unlikely) west had better keep his fingers off that @DA|pg||
nt|fabsayc: EW probably make 6@D, but will they get there|pg||
nt|arno11: W will bid 1@H |pg||
nt|petergill: Ben H-P in his youth used not to like to pass against a strong 1@C |pg||
nt|petergill: Matej Ivancic is from Croatia and Ben Handley-Pritchard is from England|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Either 2@C  or 1NT   18-20 balanced|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: not uncommon in England, maybe in places like Norway where they like Ekren |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Also after double?|pg||
nt|petergill: Still the same |pg||
nt|arno11: showing FG less than 3 controls (ace= 3 king=2)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You gain 2 steps after an overcall|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.pzbs.pl/wyniki/turnieje/2010/pula/team/pulateam2leaderb.html  for running scores|pg||
nt|hedyg: 10 tricks in NT, 11 in @D |pg||
mb|4D|nt|henryb:  Must not have weak 2 available|pg||
nt|rv: 3rd seat pre-empt can be wide ranging for most partnerships|pg||
nt|athene: a very surprising pass from east - i would have thought it was simply a choice between double and 2@H (i woudl double)|pg||
nt|athene: if you play Lebensohl then 3@S is forcing (with an invitational hand south would bid 2nt then 3@S)|pg||
nt|arno11: 1@H is 11-16, 4+ cards can have 4 cards+ a longer suit that¬¥s why alerted|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=3308  Iris Gr√ºmm, pretty young woman|pg||
nt|athene: it's always very tough, when one person has shortage in his partner's first-bid suit, to find out whether there are wasted values there|pg||
nt|fabsayc: so this is blue team ew then, arno?|pg||
nt|arno11: 2@D 9 cards in both directions so could be 4@H 5@D or the other way round|pg||
nt|Walddk2: pass and redouble|pg||
nt|arno11: also after dbl, XX wld show 5-7 with clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: South does not double because 1@C is artificial.|pg||
nt|roswolf: a weak 2 is very strong by today's standards|pg||
nt|marlowepi: double?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ah|pg||
nt|mdgraham: oops|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, thousands play Multi|pg||
nt|peachy: Or some polish versions, or Ekren's etc.|pg||
nt|athene: ouch|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, all you can say here is that South thought 3@S was forcing and North didn't|pg||
nt|vugraphzqn: I think some misunderstand here...S look angry...|pg||
nt|petergill: Dbl will be some sort of two suiter, perhaps hearts and a minor ( I guess) |pg||
nt|hedyg: i would have bid 3NT|pg||
mb|5C|nt|mdgraham: very disciplined pass over 1@s by East|pg||
nt|athene: i think north might have thought they didn't play lebenshl here|pg||
nt|athene: there is less reason for it after you double 2@D|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.pzbs.pl/wyniki/turnieje/2010/pula/team/pulateam2leaderb.html  for running scores|pg||
nt|athene: because mostly with a weak hand you are bidding 2major|pg||
nt|arno11: yes Martin at least as far as I know :)|pg||
nt|athene: now when west doesn't cue 4@H, that is music to east's ears|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Blue Club is only alive in Austria I think. Fischer-Saurer also play it, don't they?|pg||
nt|petergill: Astro or Aspro over the strong club|pg||
nt|petergill: On a non-club lead, I think 6@D can be made by picking spades then squeezing West|pg||
nt|hedyg: 5@C= control with @d fit|pg||
nt|petergill: but @CJ is the natural lead to 5@D|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: dont like the 1nt - i would double having both majors|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2NT may show good clubs |pg||
mb|6D|nt|vugraphpl2: ale klotni nie ma atmosfera dalej ok|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: i think a polish 1@C should be assumed to be natural-ish and defend accordingly|pg||
nt|athene: there's such a fine line between "disciplined" and "wet" :)|pg||
nt|athene: 2nt is just natural by the look of it|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes. You might not like 2@H, but double is possible|pg||
nt|peachy: If playing sound overcalls, E suit is not good enough.  Opposite passed partner, I think it is just conservative, not quite "wet"|pg||
nt|athene: south might just bid 3nt now anyway|pg||
nt|athene: those tens and nines are all quite nice|pg||
nt|mdgraham: wouldn't mind double|pg||
nt|athene: ok, maybe she doesn't like music :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|arno11: Fischer Saurer are playing 5 card majors and strong 1@C|pg||
nt|arno11: pass 0-4, 1@D 5-7|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: dont understand east's pass over 4@S|pg||
nt|arno11: the austrian ladies pairs are mostly playing Blue Club, so anyone can play with anyone|pg||
nt|fabsayc: here the second/fourth lead tells declarer club finesse working|pg||
nt|vugraphzqn: 2/4 leads|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.pzbs.pl/wyniki/turnieje/2010/pula/team/pulateam2leaderb.html  for running scores|pg||
nt|athene: well, unless it's a singleton lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 96 teams were divided into 24 groups of 4. Three rounds of qualifying, and then Swiss|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is Swiss 3, last match today|pg||
nt|peachy: with such distributional hands, club could easily be singleton|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6 more tomorrow|pg||
nt|athene: the Poles lead differently from everyone else from most suit combinations, but they have to follow the rest of the world with a singleton :)|pg||
nt|arno11: forgot Fucik and Purkarthofer and wife and husband Terraneo (Franz + Sylvia) who played Blue-Club for Austria in Ostend|pg||
nt|petergill: EW are lucky that they aren't overboard. |pg||
nt|petergill: Dble of 4@H would have yielded - let me add it up on a trump lead |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Did you say Ace = 3    king = 2   Arno?   In that case they are not playing "normal" responses, zz  as played by Nystr√∂m-Bertheau rather where ace = 3   king = 2   queen = 1     zz|pg||
nt|petergill: This will be interesting!|pg||
nt|petergill: @CJ lead = defence is doing OK, @SA lead = no good|pg||
pc|sA|nt|brolucius: Yes.|pg||
nt|rv: not sure if X meant anything specific, possibly East felt he had unstated strength|pg||
nt|petergill: no good|pg||
nt|hedyg: how he can make it|pg||
pc|s5|nt|peachy: West's choices for opening lead, difficult|pg||
nt|athene: no way to beat this - declarer will just plot away at the clubs|pg||
nt|athene: *plod away|pg||
nt|fabsayc: do they lead singleton?|pg||
pc|s8|nt|tomi2: dont know what systems they use, but Martnes is fan of a system with very weak openings w/r and strong club while vulnerable he prefers to play natural openings|pg||
nt|athene: with @HAK @CAK off the hand declarer knows he needs a certain amount of good fortune, but it's all forthcoming|pg||
nt|Walddk2: With the left hand. Nice gadget|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Don't you all do that?|pg||
nt|arno11: dbl wld have netted 800|pg||
nt|arno11: sry ace 2 king 1 |pg||
nt|Walddk2: ok then|pg||
nt|petergill: -5 would be 1100 but I think declarer might have escaped for only 800 in 4@HX|pg||
nt|petergill: Ben Handley - Pritchard was recently the npc of the Croatian Ladies team at Ostend in the Euro Championships |pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|petergill: and he will make it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am glad to see that an unsupported ace is a disaster|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It takes TWO tricks to beat a slam|pg||
pc|s2|nt|vugraphpl2: gosia miala obawy ze singlowa wziela|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s7|nt|peachy: grr :)|pg||
nt|arno11: http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=3308    Iris Gr√ºmm|pg||
nt|athene: i guess you try to set up the spades|pg||
nt|fabsayc: left handed people don't|pg||
nt|athene: using the clubs as entry to dummy|pg||
nt|arno11: http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=13996    and her partner :)|pg||
nt|athene: playing the @CJ at trick 1 might have been a deceptive move in case the lead was a singleton - south might not be able to read it|pg||
nt|athene: but it does mean you can't get two club entries to dummy|pg||
nt|athene: if north is sufficiently well-read to insert the king on the @C5 lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.pzbs.pl/wyniki/turnieje/2010/pula/team/pulateam2leaderb.html  for running scores|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6 matches of 8 boards today|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Finishing late tonight European time|pg||
nt|arno11: how big will group A be in the end?|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|brolucius: North-South have sold out too cheaply, really. They have half the points and a 4-4 spade fit.|pg||
nt|jbgood: a steal for sure|pg||
nt|rv: not best defense|pg||
pc|dA|nt|Walddk2: Maybe Tomislav knows|pg||
pc|d3|nt|athene: if the defence had attacked hearts right from the start they would be threatening to set up east's long heart before declarer got the clubs going, but south could change plans and ...|pg||
nt|athene: go for the diamonds and spades - with both finesses working he would have nine tricks without any clubs|pg||
nt|arno11: now 28 teams, but will be less in the end|pg||
pc|d2|nt|petergill: One reason that people bid a lot nowadays is that opponents often do not take the penalties on offer - with a fairly balanced hand (i.e. no singleton nor void), West might have ...|pg||
nt|petergill: doubled 4@H|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|tomi2: this hand seems to be the reason.|pg||
pc|dK|nt|petergill: On a red suit lead, declarer runs @SJ, and when East wins @SA, a club back to break up the impending black-suit squeeze seems to be necessary |pg||
pc|h6|pc|d4|nt|athene: but with a solid 5-5 trump fit you aren't usually all that worried about entries|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The last 3 rounds will be Danish where two teams can meet more than once|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|d6|nt|vugraphpl2: gajcyk wypytuje o sekwencje zrzutek|pg||
pc|h4|nt|rv: East's X should have possibly enabled West to defend hand more accurately, he knew partner has most of unseen values|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i guess it was a pealty double of 3H. unlucky they ran|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 10@H right, @dK right |pg||
nt|athene: and the @SQ|pg||
pc|d9|nt|peachy: everything right :)|pg||
nt|athene: finessing looks like the best play here|pg||
nt|peachy: while he is  thinking:   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Istria.png  Pula is located by the beautiful Adriatic Sea|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this is the sort of hand the opposition always make aganst you - off course you go about two off|pg||
nt|athene: there are some layouts where it would be wrong but nothing like as many|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes that is why double was better - the flexible friend|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|jbgood: they would have to fight over 3 clubs then - not easy|pg||
pc|s3|nt|athene: ok, perhaps declarer decided that west would not lead from @SQxxx - so he either has five, or he doesn't have the queen|pg||
pc|c3|nt|athene: if he has @SQxxxx and no entry you are safe to rise @SA|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
mc|12|nt|petergill: If my analysis is not clear to you, then I recommend Kelsey's book on squeezes|pg||
nt|hedyg: great book|pg||
