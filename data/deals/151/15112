nt|haans: changing pairs after 4 boards so a pause|pg||
nt|gulyas: also, ruffing low instead of discarding a @C did not help either|pg||

nt|Walddk2: I think an Indy is quite charming, just for a change. Should not be a permanent ingredient in an event|pg||

pc|c2|pc|c8|nt|gulyas: in each wuit|pg||
nt|gulyas: suit|pg||
nt|gulyas: I think he will get it right|pg||
nt|gulyas: he knows N has 3@S, 3-4@H, and probably at least 4@D|pg||
nt|gulyas: so 3343, 3442, or 3352|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If only he did not have @C9|pg||
nt|gulyas: obv N has AK in @D|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And if Padon had remained silent|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Then he would have got it right for sure|pg||
nt|gulyas: so 7 tricks or 12? interesting how many tricks can depend on one decision|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The longer you think the longer you are inclined to get it wrong is my experience|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What do you think, Daniel?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The more likely I mean|pg||

mc|7|nt|haans: next board|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You can't really blame him|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's unusual that the guy who makes a takeout double has a doubleton in an unbid suit|pg||
nt|gulyas: its a Q of style I think|pg||
nt|haans: dont agree with @CJ|pg||
nt|gulyas: its better to concentrate on the Ms, you would want at least 3 from an unbid M, but the more points you have, to better to get into the auction while u can|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A case for cahing the ace first is that South might have the singleton queen|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If he hasn't, then play for a 2-2 break|pg||
nt|Walddk2: What do you think?|pg||
nt|haans: we all agree to that|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Last round of the IMP Pairs coming up|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Then a break for 20 mins or so before the Individual|pg||
nt|gulyas: after the x, I disagree, he played it right until that point|pg||
nt|gulyas: but after N so hastily cashed @HA and switched to @D, I would think he was afraid you will run away with the @C suit|pg||
nt|gulyas: so thats not QTx|pg||
nt|gulyas: but these are just small hints, I can see why he played it the way he did|pg||
