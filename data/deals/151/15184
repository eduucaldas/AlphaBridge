nt|athene: Or if you really don't like that, play a 3NT opener to show a strong 4major bid.|pg||
nt|flash: again, this is Board-a-Match (Point-a-Board) scoring; so you'll see some decisions you wouldn't see at IMPs|pg||
mb|2C|nt|athene: 1@S lets NS in and now North might well be sacrificing, as happened in the other room.|pg||
mb|4S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|4N|mb|p|nt|athene: In this form of scoring, you sacrifice more aggressively, because 500 vs 620 is a win.|pg||
nt|flash: for those with the downloaded version of BBO, you can see the Closed Room auction by moving your cursor over the Closed Room result on this screen|pg||

mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|flash: for those watching on-line, i believe you have to click on the Other Table tab to see it|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: The traditional gambling 3NT showing a solid minor with nothing outside is just a bad convention as it totally wrongsides 3NT.|pg||
nt|athene: Much better to play it as a strong 4-major opener.|pg||
pc|sT|nt|flash: accurate result in both rooms; headed for a push (tied board)|pg||
nt|suketbombi: agree William totaly|pg||
nt|suketbombi: an inspired @C lead wud fetch 800 tho|pg||
nt|athene: Meckwell used to play transfer pre-empts which meant they had 3@S opener as a solid suit, allowing partner to bid 3nt|pg||
nt|vugraphzre: meckstroth asking for time to consider|pg||
nt|flash: this will make the (available) score 6-4 USA...   they're using the European-style scoring|pg||

pc|h2|pc|hJ|pc|h3|pg||
pc|c5|nt|flash: doesn't want a @H back; gets his @C!!!|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps winning the first trick with the @SJ was meant to be suit preference for the club ruff|pg||
nt|flash: now the defense will take 3 more tricks|pg||

nt|athene: Then if responder has spades you can still stop in 2@S|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|mb|p|nt|suketbombi: that is the contract for N_s:)|pg||

mb|p|nt|athene: maybe something like 4-1-6-2 shape|pg||
nt|athene: West would have been better off to wait until NS actually bid hearts, and then double for takeout, perhaps.|pg||

nt|suketbombi: wires are crossed Rodwell probaly intended to bid the suits upwards here|pg||

mb|d|mb|p|nt|athene: if north can bid 6nt i don't see meckstroth finding the diamond lead|pg||
nt|flash: in general, the idea is to avoid losing boards, not to win them...   6NT only if your scorecard strongly suggests you need a board??|pg||
nt|athene: North doesn't think even Meckstroth will make nine tricks in hearts.|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|athene: now we might hear 6nt - but this auction warns east not to lead a heart perhaps|pg||
nt|suketbombi: she has not shown her support wil bid 6@C with her control rich and the supporting hand she has but 6nt unlikely:(|pg||
nt|athene: NS were given an easier ride in the other room.|pg||

nt|sharkey: 6 NT in OR - 12 tricks|pg||
mb|1C|nt|rv: 6@c is right contract, 6n in trouble on @d lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|rv: I expect Berk-Sontag to bid accurately, reach 6@c and lose the board|pg||
mb|p|mb|3C|mb|p|nt|sharkey: Yes - but BAM scoring elicit the gambling element|pg||
nt|sharkey: I think N will "correct" to 6 NT|pg||
nt|rv: I suspect Berk has too much respect for Sontag as well as Helness|pg||
nt|sharkey: Sontag dared Helgemo to lead a @C last board of Spingold; Helgemo didnt and lost the match|pg||
nt|rv: he may bid 4@c followed by RKC|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4S|mb|p|nt|rv: 4@D could be kickback|pg||
nt|rv: 4@s shows 0 or 3 keys?|pg||
nt|rv: in minor suit fit auctions, 4@d is rkc in @cs and 4@h is rkc in @ds, this is called kickback|pg||
mb|5N|mb|p|mb|6C|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|rv: 5n is pick a slam, Sontag rightly bid 6@c|pg||

nt|rv: only 8 tricks even on this lead, I suspect Helness will cash out|pg||
nt|rv: he will risk going 2 down by playing a @s especially against this quality of opps and form of scoring|pg||
nt|rv: not risk|pg||
nt|sharkey: attempt sneak a @S thru perhaps...|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d5|nt|rv: I don't think so, if @hs are 5-3, he may go 2 down, wont risk it especially against good opps|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|sharkey: he must make some assumptions re action OR and plan accordingly|pg||
nt|rv: he knows opps have listened to double, he has not doubled 1@s to show 4@hs, @DJ has won first trick as well|pg||
