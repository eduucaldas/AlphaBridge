pc|h5|nt|athene: South doesn't like having the void in partner's first-bid suit|pg||
nt|patricck: I know that it is the suit partner opened, but I believe 4@C by Suth should be a splinter there|pg||
pc|h3|nt|roswolf: but she is far too strong to shut up shop unilaterally|pg||
nt|athene: you have so much room over 2@S, you should definitely be able to explore these hands to find perfect fit slams|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pg||
nt|athene: the point is, even if you give information to the defence, you are never going down in game|pg||
nt|athene: so you might as well find out if slam just happens to be there|pg||
nt|roswolf: another 11 to small|pg||

mb|p|nt|yo_yo: well to be fair the weak NT didnt help earlier|pg||
nt|ady: e/w need to keep out of game|pg||
nt|lestergold: no game here for e/w|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6@s frigidaire?|pg||
mb|1D|nt|haans: The Complete Book of Balasncing Mike Lawrence|pg||
nt|mcarroll: SZ rapidly approaching a target of 10 imps per board to win.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: and not actually a bad contract|pg||
nt|pelu: ok slam - but I dont exp that NS will come even close to bid slam|pg||
nt|athene: south might just respond 4@S|pg||
nt|lestergold: Cooke is the perfect partner for garvey he is a thoughtful disciplined highly intelligent player around whom Garvey can dance his dance of death|pg||
mb|2H|nt|Walddk2: 2@D  5+ hearts  9+ hcp|pg||
nt|roswolf: transfer|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 4@S for n/s|pg||
nt|lestergold: unassuming cue bid not game forcing|pg||
nt|lestergold: however this may lead to game|pg||
nt|yo_yo: surprised Bakhshi didnt double to show those @H|pg||
nt|lestergold: east may likem his diamond fit|pg||
nt|reisig: no alert for 2@h?|pg||
nt|pelu: I would hate to open 1@D on the N-hand :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: and Garvey deals out quite a lot of death against anyone but the toughest opposition|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|lestergold: systematic requirements i suppose|pg||
mb|4C|nt|Walddk2: It's like 20/20 cricket, run rate required per over almost 10|pg||
nt|sybarra: in the category of "oh good"........|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: at last a penalty double bid as penalty taken as penalty|pg||
nt|garnetts: transfer weak twos --interesting |pg||
nt|blum1956: looks like for EW more hands are suitable for a weak two|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@H   NF|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not a pretty fit|pg||
nt|pelu: I know it the system - but still :)|pg||
nt|athene: they play strong club, 5-card majors, multi 2@D, so 1@D is very loose|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6@s wants to be played by south asltho here as A@h is right doesnt matter|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: I'm sorry, we have to restart this room|pg||
mb|4D|nt|Walddk2: Patterson could also have rebid 2@S which is also non-forcing|pg||
nt|sybarra: an understatement Roland |pg||
nt|othered1: Possible for NS also to  play @H, if EW decide not to enter the auction.  But that's not the modern approach|pg||
nt|roswolf: this sort of hand shows the bow and arrow nature of these responses - remember opener is limited by his failure to open 1@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: Tosh asking what hands Patterson wouldn't bid 2@h|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You know you are in trouble when the opponents start drawing trumps|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But down in 50's|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes indeed|pg||
nt|sybarra: we call it "only 50's"|pg||
nt|lestergold: why show hearts when they have alre4ady located spade fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: dont worry Nicky anyoje takes on vugraph is very brave|pg||
mb|4S|nt|lestergold: he has a simple bid to show a good raise in spade4s|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: Holland 3@C  for major|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i cant see the point of a transfer weak 2|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Francis Hinden made 4@H  well done to her|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Frances|pg||
nt|reisig: 4@s deny a @h cue?|pg||
nt|pelu: Sorry - I was weong they are "close" now|pg||
mb|5S|nt|yo_yo: doesnt it just give opps an extra bid?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: gained 12 imps for her team on 4|pg||
nt|lestergold: i wouldnt venture into this auction with that pile of festering horse manure with a gun to my head|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: specs want to undertsand teh system|pg||
nt|lestergold: anyone explain it|pg||
nt|lestergold: heavily artificial of course|pg||
nt|lestergold: 21H must show spades|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2n support 4@c splinter|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4@d cue i assum|pg||
nt|lestergold: the key is the nebulous 1D opening and the 2@h response|pg||
mb|6S|nt|Walddk2: This is quite funny; an opener with no entry to his hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If this can be called an opener of course, but it is for them|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: in my view it does |pg||
nt|blum1956: It is fair when there is some strong option covered by the same bid|pg||
nt|ady: 4-1 spade split no problem with clubs behaving|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Mrs Bakhshi thinks it's a multi |pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: Ah!  Yes, looking at the wrong part of the card :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: On baord six they missed 7@H because the 5@D bids was exclusion blackwood and they could not locate the Q@H it seems |pg||
nt|ady: could they not have bid 5NT  immediately rather than 5@D?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes 5NT  asks about top honours|pg||
nt|ady: or maybe he tht Q@H not needed with a 6 or 7 card suit headed by the ace|pg||
nt|garnetts: That is my view David---seems that neither South worked out the potential--in Both rooms North showed six hearts--what else is needed--maybe just knwledge of the ace of trumps--who ...|pg||
nt|garnetts: cares about the queen when you ten including the AK |pg||
nt|yo_yo: a former team mate to Cameron Small so it's doubly satisfying for her I guess :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: David Bird must be a happy man today. His county, Hampshire, won the 20/20 trophy|pg||
nt|garnetts: Do not mention 20/20 after Somerste lost yesterday sensitive issue here--especially if Jane is watching |pg||
nt|garnetts: You will make her mad Roland|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes Roland, but in 20/20 10 per over is eminently achievable - especially if an inform Gilchrist is batting|pg||
nt|yo_yo: ah by South  |pg||
nt|lestergold: 2n good support im toldthe rest is fairly starightforward|pg||
mb|p|pc|h5|nt|pelu: 5@S asking for @H-control?|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hA|nt|sybarra: old fashioned forcing nt might have solved this problem ending in 2 @D's or so |pg||
nt|lestergold: unfortunately i think with Towsned's minimum 12 count and awful spade suit his 3@d bid which is effectivbely a game try was an overbid|pg||
nt|yo_yo: in case 3NT is the contract|pg||
nt|yo_yo: or 4@H|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hK|nt|lestergold: i would think it must be by impication|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h7|pg||
pc|sK|nt|Walddk2: 1NT would have been 5-11  NF|pg||
pc|s6|nt|garnetts: also you do not really need to ask for ther Q@H as you know North is not queen high for his actions |pg||
nt|garnetts: He is almost certain to have the ace |pg||

nt|Walddk4: really?|pg||
nt|lestergold: biut 6 on ice|pg||
nt|georgia19: I think they'll get there, hopefully ony to 6|pg||
nt|lestergold: i dont think may pairs would bid 6 on these cards|pg||
nt|pelu: the last slam gave - as exp - 11 IMPs to Small|pg||
mb|4S|nt|lestergold: the spades are very dodgy|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: It looks as if Twonsend thinks this shows a hand that would have made a penalty double of 1NT|pg||
nt|yo_yo: some play the double as penalty of a weak NT|pg||
nt|ady: n/s could be in difficulty here if e/w keep doubling|pg||
nt|yo_yo: some play it shows @D|pg||
nt|Walddk4: It's a slam below par obviously when you must play that suit for 1 loser|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: if east can double showing values  west will surely pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: are we into relays?|pg||
nt|sybarra: looks like (again)|pg||
nt|lestergold: extra values but even 5@s is alittle precarious|pg||

nt|lestergold: but above 12.855 Roland|pg||
nt|georgia19: Garvey not interested over weak NT|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|garnetts: I prefer the agreement that x is pens after a weak notrump and a suit after a strong/medium notrump |pg||
nt|yo_yo: oooops   true,  no agreement :)|pg||
nt|ady: n/s of the hook|pg||
nt|georgia19: Steve taking over, now you might get some intelligent comments from here....|pg||
pc|cT|nt|lestergold: Small has a sign off now|pg||
nt|lestergold: Small's diamond suit does not like like slam, material|pg||

pc|cK|pg||
nt|pelu: where did N find that X???|pg||
nt|pelu: in CR|pg||
nt|blum1956: Against weak NT it is better to play "diamonds or strong, starting from a strong NT"|pg||
pc|s2|nt|garnetts: Some decided to dbl 3NT next door--someone should have redoubled |pg||
nt|ady: 9 tricks look a lot|pg||
pc|sK|nt|garnetts: This is truely poor bridge from EW--|pg||
nt|yo_yo: there's not better about either, just depends which hand comes along|pg||
nt|ady: might well make on the lead|pg||
nt|yo_yo: however I would have expected a pair of such quality as townsend Bakhshi to have discussed this one|pg||

nt|yo_yo: they are a newish partnership|pg||
nt|ady: Q@H favourable this should make|pg||
nt|blum1956: the strongest part of the weak NT - you make the opponents not to know their HCP's. They often land in 22-23 HCP 3NT. Still you nead to beat that.|pg||

nt|ady: last hand  n/s playing 1NT    so some more imps for Hackett|pg||
mb|1D|nt|lestergold: here is a no play game easy to reach!|pg||
nt|georgia19: can NS bid to 3NT despite a 9 card heart fit|pg||
mb|1N|mb|3D|nt|blum1956: EW will probably climb up to 3NT|pg||
nt|roswolf: north will show his majors?|pg||
nt|lestergold: however this barrage may prevent n/s rom finding their heart fit|pg||
mb|d|nt|othered1: Actually more a throw in than a squeeze.  I wonder if @DA lead could have prevented it.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Last board of the match and our broadcast from Hong Kong. Many thanks to Jonathan who has been a terrific operator for five full days. Very well done!|pg||
nt|lestergold: and thus doing them a great favour!|pg||
nt|georgia19: 4@H needs good defence to beat it|pg||
nt|lestergold: id say needs bad defence to let it thru|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|roswolf: 2@S seems right now |pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: e/w may get to a tight 3NT  looks tough|pg||

nt|lestergold: but could well be a push|pg||

pc|c8|nt|othered1: Was 2N for minors?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: yes|pg||
nt|ralfwil: This is a kind of bidding I don´t like. a natural 2@s forcing on an unpassed hand and a 5-card suit for me|pg||
nt|ralfwil: D is a balanced hand |pg||
nt|ralfwil: what´s your opinion Mike?|pg||
nt|lestergold: its a normal 3n just happems to have no chance|pg||
pc|c4|nt|roswolf: a very sensible auction by e/w|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|Walddk2: Also thanks to our excellent commentators, David, Peter, Martin and Hans|pg||
nt|garnetts: I agree David--NS just need to take care |pg||
nt|blum1956: only 8 tricks even taking under account 3 in hearts and 3 in clubs. The declarer must work a lot.|pg||

nt|patricck: this is a far better slam than the last offering|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|patricck: doesn't make on a spade lead of course|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|athene: South opens 1@S because she knows the match has not gone well, perhaps|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Will it make without one?|pg||
mb|2N|nt|Walddk2: I don't think so|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: I like Nevena's double of 1@S in the other room|pg||
nt|patricck: if you can concede a diamond and ruff two diamonds in dummy you are home|pg||
nt|athene: you have very nice values and four hearts - ok, 4333 is a flaw but if you don't get in there you might find yourself being shutout of a game|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w are strangely quiet|pg||
nt|athene: Brian might intend 2nt to show a very strong diamond raise|pg||
nt|roswolf: but this looks dangereous|pg||
nt|vugraphzda: No alert from Sandra|pg||
nt|athene: playing acol, with light 2-over-1 bids, 1nt is fairly limited|pg||
nt|vugraphzda: Now she's explaind it as systemic|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm |pg||
nt|athene: so you don't have the "1nt then 2nt" on a balanced 11 the way you might in america|pg||
nt|athene: right - 2nt shows big diamond raise|pg||
mb|3D|nt|roswolf: but what system?|pg||
nt|vugraphzda: Yes, now clarified|pg||

nt|Walddk2: East has been too passive here|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|pc|h7|pg||

pc|h5|pc|hA|pc|hT|pg||
nt|patricck: Takeout double by East on the first round|pg||

mb|1S|nt|Walddk2: But he did not expect declarer to have 4 clubs|pg||
mb|d|nt|yo_yo: lots of weak NTs|pg||
nt|roswolf: this may be feisty|pg||
nt|lestergold: easy 4@s n/s|pg||
nt|georgia19: after @D lead and @S switch it could have bben difficult with a threat of a ruff/discard|pg||
nt|georgia19: opening bids are getting weaker|pg||
nt|lestergold: probably be a push board in any case|pg||
mb|2C|nt|Walddk2: 1@C is often 12-14 balanced for N-S|pg||
mb|d|nt|lestergold: meanwhilei see they didnt bid that esxcellent spade slam in open and one or two other swings and at presenr small is running away with this match|pg||

mb|p|nt|ady: 1NT   a lot down|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@H is 3+ cards and can still be 12-14 balanced|pg||

mb|p|nt|yo_yo: when do you double and when do you compete|pg||
nt|ady: west likely to pass|pg||
nt|garnetts: I would rather be in 6@D than 2@D |pg||
mb|4H|nt|yo_yo: i suppose if East double he fears West will lead @S|pg||
nt|blum1956: 5@d looks the best spot. Even 6@d makeable. But East was most unhappy with his overcall. Certainly he was going to rebid|pg||
nt|garnetts: I suppose that West couldn't bid 2@D because it was conventional--personally I would bid 3@D then |pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: decent 3NT for EW here|pg||
nt|sybarra: feisty all the was to 2 @C |pg||
nt|georgia19: 3 or 4 @H?|pg||

mb|p|pc|dA|nt|georgia19: 12 tricks can be made now|pg||
pc|d5|nt|othered1: does the delayed 2@S imply a good hand, as opposed to immediate action?  If not initial pass seems strange|pg||
nt|yo_yo: South will be glad to play a hand at last|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d8|pg||
nt|georgia19: strange if south passes E/W might miss the game|pg||

pc|s5|nt|othered1: delayed 2@C, that is|pg||

nt|lestergold: but no scope here for any expert play|pg||

nt|lestergold: oh i think erichsen didnt double 3N if he wasnt doubling 4@c|pg||
nt|lestergold: second spade ruff promotes the T@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|georgia19: wow, can this be made.... nasty club position, I can't see it myself|pg||
nt|lestergold: and the club position is ugly |pg||

pc|c4|pg||

nt|lestergold: garvey has gone for a deceptive play here|pg||
pc|d3|pc|h2|nt|Walddk2: 1@S  2@H  ;  2@S  3@D  ;  3@H  3@S  ; 4@S  is a possible auction|pg||
nt|lestergold: so only 8 tricks altho should have been 2 off|pg||
nt|yo_yo: south in trouble now on the run of the @C|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes may well|pg||
nt|panja: hi all, there will be an endplay in Diamonds...N needed to shift to a @D..|pg||
nt|yo_yo: can discard 2@D and 1@S easily but then??|pg||

pc|d5|nt|georgia19: may get out for -1 now|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|nt|garnetts: on the last hand the auction in the OR room was odd to say the least--East was unbelievably conservative |pg||
nt|yo_yo: j@S will be welcome|pg||
nt|garnetts: West overcalled 1@C with 1@D and west just bid hearts twice |pg||
nt|yo_yo: NS under a lot of pressure now|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h7|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|garnetts: Dixon and Silverstone have for years thought three of amjor was a pointless contrcat and simply agreed that it was always forcing |pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@S is the default rebid with an unbalanced minimum hand without 3 hearts, so it did not guarantee six cards|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h5|nt|garnetts: perhaps he isn't aware of the bonus for making games or slams |pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: Tom asks about carding methods|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|panja: in the five card ending with @SAJ and @DAJ3 in E hand, S will have to keep two Spades and 3 Diamonds...then duck a @S to South..and then final endplay|pg||
nt|lestergold: was a clever player but ironically contract niow cold|pg||

mb|d|an|Strong NT|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|athene: double perhaps is the "strong notrump double" - it can be hard to show that hand in competition if you couldn't open it 1nt in the first place|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: interesting issues in this spade suit too|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: north knows where he wants to play|pg||
nt|athene: if you lead from dummy and west plays low, the odds play is to put the nine in, playing for @SK10x / @SQ10x onside|pg||
nt|athene: but|pg||
nt|athene: sometimes a good west with that holding will play the big one|pg||
nt|athene: to try to talk you out of the percentage play|pg||
nt|athene: so you might argue that if west plays low you should rise jack|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Walddk2: It doesn't matter what a good player does|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You have decided before you play|pg||
pc|c3|pc|cT|pc|c4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Low to the 9 spot|pg||
nt|athene: yes, you can always take your "a priori" odds to the bank |pg||
nt|Walddk2: and if an honour, you play for H10x|pg||
nt|patricck: yes, that is the percentage play...doesn't work so well on this deal though|pg||

nt|roswolf: could be a lot of bidding here|pg||
nt|roswolf: how many spades?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Close to 4|pg||
nt|othered1: That 1N overcall(as opposed to an opening) wouldn't be everyone's cup of tea.  West's great @Slength, however, is a great catch.|pg||
nt|roswolf: a case for 3@S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4 can go down but it may not|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It takes a club ruff to beat 4@S|pg||
nt|roswolf: or 4@S or even 2@S SAY SOME SPECS|pg||
nt|othered1: 4@H isn't hopeless, is it? But they won't get to play there|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Is it obvious that they will find the defence against 4@S?|pg||
nt|lestergold: undoubtedly one of our best card players|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I don't think so|pg||
nt|roswolf: not at all|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|ady: did the right thing   5 too high|pg||
nt|lestergold: schooledijn decades of high stake rubber bridge|pg||
nt|ady: e/w can make either 3NT or 5@C  with K@D well placed   but have been kept out of the bidding|pg||
mb|2S|nt|yo_yo: Townsend got it right , as he had with every decision this match|pg||
nt|roswolf: good 2-way shot|pg||
nt|othered1: Not sure 5 is easy on a @C lead, but 4 should be OK|pg||
nt|othered1: @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: wow|pg||
nt|Walddk2: what a lead|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: 4@h cold as cards lie|pg||
nt|lestergold: of course no reason for them to get there|pg||
pc|cT|nt|roswolf: indeed nick is very very good combines flair with excellent technique|pg||
nt|othered1: One way to get @C ruff, if both N and S read it correctly|pg||
nt|yo_yo: South will be surprised to be undoubled|pg||
nt|georgia19: going to be played from other side - doubt if it'll make much difference|pg||
pc|c4|pc|cK|nt|garnetts: I think no decision here--must be right to pass--might have been tempted on the South hand except that partner has passed already |pg||
nt|blum1956: I would pass as well - to find 6@h you need a stiff club and this is not enough while 5@h may well go down|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
pc|cA|pc|cQ|pc|d2|nt|Walddk2: South will|pg||

nt|lestergold: 6@h 2@s 1 ruff and a @d|pg||
nt|ralfwil: here is another board where my bidding is different. I can bid 2@h on a hand like Ss|pg||
nt|lestergold: Towsend probably knopws he was being 'done' but with his flat 15 points what action could he jusify at the 4 level?|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d6|pc|dQ|pc|dA|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sK|nt|roswolf: a just reward|pg||

nt|lestergold: that slam cost senior 13 imps|pg||
nt|georgia19: I wonder what the 2NT rebid showed|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lestergold: when Halberg showed no further interest over Senior's 4@s cue i think she had no reson to bid 6|pg||

pc|sK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If no interference it would have been 4+ spades, 3+ hearts, invitational|pg||

nt|ady: needs heart guess|pg||

pc|cA|nt|garnetts: Normal these days to bid on not a lot in response --has its merits too|pg||

nt|lestergold: now the play is everything!|pg||
pc|c6|nt|yo_yo: now to see our  "immigrant" in action|pg||
nt|ady: with east showing singleton diamond  this is likely to made  heart guess likely |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Results from round 1: Rosen v Senior 25-4 ; Teltscher v P Hackett 19-11 ; Small v Hinden 17-13, and de Botton v Crouch 16-14|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i think he will get it right, will find the singleton !@D and long @C with Bakhshi|pg||
nt|lestergold: if south reads east for club length on the bidding and lead he may find it hard to read the heart however when east shows up with stiff trump he will have a lot of thinki9ng to do|pg||

nt|georgia19: 4@C or 4@H?|pg||
nt|georgia19: or a mad pass?|pg||
mb|4C|nt|roswolf: maybe not|pg||
nt|othered1: If that's multi, there are lots of different defenses to it.   Some let  you make a takeout "double" of @H immediately, but west's @S holding might be inadequate|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: this looks -2 for sure|pg||
nt|lestergold: no wsay|pg||
nt|athene: lots of very interesting tactical/psychological issues for south|pg||
nt|athene: if you are scared of 4@S making, you might bid 4@C|pg||

nt|yo_yo: tempting to bid 3NT with the north hand now|pg||
nt|lestergold: twice as many bnids to reach 3N in open room that was the only difference|pg||

nt|athene: now East needs to lead a heart through at some point to break up the endplay|pg||
nt|georgia19: swop a @D to a @H in east|pg||
pc|sK|nt|athene: in the other room it was just for the second undertrick but here it's for the contract|pg||

mb|2C!|nt|yo_yo: bye mike|pg||
mb|4D|nt|yo_yo: last hand here|pg||
nt|athene: east opened 1@D systemically, silencing south - then 1@S, 2nt rebid, 3@D from south, 3nt, all pass|pg||
mb|4S|nt|roswolf: on 17 4@SX duly made|pg||
nt|roswolf: in the other room by the twins|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@C can be 10-15 with 6+ clubs and no 4-card major|pg||
nt|ady: bye      thx all|pg||
mb|p|nt|garnetts: unexceptional last hand |pg||
nt|ady: thx all|pg||
nt|yo_yo: EW have had a great set|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@D relay|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 20 IMPs in a 60-board match is 17-13 VPs|pg||
nt|athene: 2nt obviously intended as something cunning but perhaps misunderstood|pg||
nt|lestergold: well here would be a good time to puntg a slam for e/w especially as it makes|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: Townsend particularly played very well|pg||
nt|garnetts: I do not agree they have had a great set--for my money they have a lot of issues to sort out--they had the best of the luck |pg||
mb|p|pc|d8|nt|Walddk2: 2NT 6+ clubs and a maximum|pg||
nt|roswolf: can north find the killing lead if 3nt is the final contract|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dA|pc|d9|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They wrong-sided NT|pg||
nt|othered1: 3N is from unlucky side, but maybe they can find 5@C|pg||
nt|lestergold: the winning team get to p[lay camrose however the selectors will tajke into accoun t the performance of individual pairs on a butler basis to select England team for next season so ...|pg||
nt|lestergold: very important|pg||
nt|lestergold: not the only determinant but a major factor|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Many thanks to David Kenward, our excellent operator in Solihull|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And to our commentators, Mike, Ralf and Kath|pg||
nt|ady: easy 3NT here|pg||
pc|d6|nt|roswolf: yes slightly unlucky but|pg||
nt|othered1: I'd personally call it a system flaw.|pg||
pc|dK|nt|yo_yo: just one misunderstanding?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: for a new partnership a great start|pg||
nt|roswolf: trying to block the suit|pg||
pc|d5|pc|dT|pg||
nt|ady: low club switch and queen played by Holland best|pg||
pc|s4|nt|yo_yo: thanks everyone|pg||
pc|s2|nt|blum1956: you're right, David. The opponents' play was not a sort of top bridge. Recall that 4@h instead of seven, for example|pg||
nt|garnetts: I was thinking about all of that 3NT and not 4@S |pg||
nt|garnetts: and so on |pg||
pc|sQ|pc|d3|pg||
pc|s3|pc|d4|nt|yo_yo: thanks Darren well done |pg||
pc|sK|nt|roswolf: yes all systems have their downsides|pg||
