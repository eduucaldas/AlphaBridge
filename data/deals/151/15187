mb|1S|nt|vugraphzrd: i was trying to undo to put in the double of 7nt but i hit back by mistake...|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|brolucius: Ah, East did find the double. Yes, well judged. |pg||
nt|arobson:  Did he lead the ace?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He probably also led a diamond to add insult to injury|pg||
nt|arobson:  Can hardly run away|pg||
nt|vugraphzrd: he claimed 1 down.|pg||

nt|Walddk2: No heart switch apparently|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|arobson:  Then he'd make 11 tricks?...|pg||
mb|1C|mb|1H|mb|d|nt|Walddk2: Or if there was one, Broge did not continue the suit|pg||
nt|arobson:  Or did he duck the spade?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't know|pg||

nt|brolucius: North-South play transfers over a 1@H overcall. A double shows spades.|pg||
nt|arobson:  THis will go a swiftish down one|pg||
nt|arobson:  West thought he was protected by the Law (10 trumps = ten tricks)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Over a black-suit overcall (1@S or 2@C) they play switch bids. So after 1@D (1@S), 2@C would show hearts and 2@H would show clubs. |pg||
pc|dK|nt|brolucius: I know all this because I have just finished writing a 240-page book with Brogeland! (Normally I know practically nothing of the players' bidding methods and everyone says.... ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: Hopeless!)|pg||

nt|vugraphzrd: Ok see you all soon.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Thanks for watching! That was the lat board of the set.|pg||
nt|arobson:  bye all thank you for watching sorry about the technical glitches|pg||
