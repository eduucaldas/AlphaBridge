nt|athene: good decision - you are probably going to go down in 5@H on @DA, diamond |pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|athene: we haven't yet reached the stage where a 1@H bid to show hearts is alertable|pg||

mb|1D|mb|d|nt|ady: good morning all|pg||

nt|daman: soft board to start off|pg||

mb|3S|nt|Walddk4: Hi Shirley|pg||
nt|Walddk4: E-W are Crouch-Patterson and I have their somewhat complicated system in front of me|pg||
nt|sybarra: Roland and Geoffrey |pg||
nt|Walddk4: We may need it|pg||
mb|4H|nt|roswolf: 2@D = SPADES AND ANOTHER I THINK|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Crouch is pitiful on BBO and one of our regular commentators|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 1NT is 14-16 in 1st and 2nd|pg||
nt|ady: good morning Kath   David|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hello from Manchester|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: Hi all. Welcome to Solihull|pg||
nt|ady: not much difficulty   especially on likely heart lead|pg||
nt|yo_yo: we saw Townsend & Bakhshi put up a great performance this time yesterday|pg||
nt|daman: Italians always double with hands like East   points before shape|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|daman: I would have passed|pg||

nt|daman: I like lasagna    does that count?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|garnetts: Good morning everyone |pg||
nt|roswolf: yes lots of transfer responses on a strong club base|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3nt has perhaps a chance, but not 4@s|pg||
nt|lestergold: Good afternoon|pg||
nt|lestergold: Hi George|pg||
nt|daman: Hi Mike|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s9|nt|yo_yo: anyone know the results?|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Results from round 1: Rosen v Senior 25-4 ; Teltscher v P Hackett 19-11 ; Small v Hinden 17-13, and de Botton v Crouch 16-14|pg||
nt|yo_yo: david are there any results online?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Division 2: FEGARTY beat ROBERTS 25-5; PRYOR beat BIRD 25-5; COOPER beat SHILLITOE 23-7; DHONDY beat COPE 18-11 (Cope was penalised 1 VP for slow play)|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: Players seem very chipper for such an early hour|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|garnetts: I agree Roland but with AQ stiff it is a reasonable bid as long as it cannot be passed |pg||
nt|roswolf: n/s play a standard 5 card major system i think - relatively uncommom in acol land|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h8|nt|yo_yo: good morning from Manchester|pg||
nt|yo_yo: hello from Manchester|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ralfwil: this lead can help declarer|pg||

nt|yo_yo: that's very impressive yes :)|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|mcarroll: another double fit in the Majors|pg||
nt|garnetts: West doing a lot of bidding |pg||
nt|yo_yo: hello again ralf :)|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hT|nt|daman: can make 6 now|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lestergold: predictable lead which stes up 3 heart tricks for declarer|pg||
nt|lestergold: curse the cards!|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Sandqvist - McIntosh are members of the England open team, and Crouch-Patterson have won the Camrose Trophy for England|pg||
nt|roswolf: both very good pairs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Sandqcist originally from Sweden, Tosh from Scotland|pg||
nt|sybarra: defense has to be a bit careful here|pg||
pc|s7|nt|haans: spade loser soon|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Division 1 after 20 boards: Teltscher +19 IMPs v Rosen, Senior +7 IMPs v Small, Crouch +8 IMPs v Hinden, Hackett P +3 IMPs v DeBotton|pg||
pc|c4|pc|sJ|nt|yo_yo: Michelle must have been having kittens with that awful south hand|pg||
nt|roswolf: cashing out|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/w could be candidates for one of the strongest mixed pairs on the planet|pg||
nt|daman: that's a pretty broad statement|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Division 2: Cooper +36 v Dhondy, Cope +27 v Pryor, Roberts +19 v Bird, Fegarty +1 v Shillitoe|pg||
mc|12|nt|daman: I have to say I don't agree|pg||

mb|2H|mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|roswolf: ah transfer responses!|pg||
nt|patricck: presumably 2@D was a transfer to @H, but haven't seen that before over a normal 1@S opening|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|d2|nt|roswolf: then the sequence is effectively the same in both rooms|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dA|pc|d7|pg||

nt|khaled_m: possible 2 down|pg||

pc|c5|pc|cK|pc|c4|nt|athene: so declarer will be able to unblock the club |pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|hA|nt|roswolf: cooke and garvey are part of the avant-garde|pg||

nt|lestergold: but should be suspicious that is exactly what to expect from a player opf King's ability|pg||
nt|ralfwil: anopther way was to play the remaining |pg||
nt|yo_yo: has he forsaken tom townsend?|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes i haD NOTICED EVEN THO AT THIS HOUR IM NORMALLY HAL;F ASLEEP|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry capslock|pg||
nt|ady: 3@D    3NT   likely staert|pg||
nt|lestergold: Hallberg of course a legend and Ms.Senior one of the world's leading lady players|pg||
nt|lestergold: against the long standing partnerhsip of cooke and garvey|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: a blow for de botton|pg||
nt|daman: I have never heard of the legend and I subscribed to IPBM for years|pg||
mb|1S|nt|lestergold: er yes basically altho they still paly in some things|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: 2@C - THE MAJORS|pg||
nt|ralfwil: remaining @s from dummy and S is squeezed|pg||
nt|yo_yo: if 1NT is 15-18 why the delay?|pg||
nt|ady: not likely to make|pg||
nt|lestergold: Garvey a great bit slightly wild talent|pg||
nt|daman: I have heard of Nevena|pg||
mb|2D|an|hearts|mb|p|nt|mcarroll: "Interesting" a very broad term  |pg||
nt|yo_yo: i hope tony forrester doesnt shout at your son|pg||
nt|lestergold: Hallberg is a world class player|pg||
nt|daman: you said legend    he is not a legend|pg||
nt|daman: and I have a plethora of specs who agree|pg||
nt|lestergold: well a matter of opinion |pg||
mb|2S!|nt|roswolf: taking advantage of the vul|pg||
nt|sybarra: might end the 4/3 with X or 3 nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 2@H|pg||
nt|ady: Brunner not opening vul with a ragged suit|pg||
nt|yo_yo: who is East,  Bakhshi is in both rooms|pg||
nt|lestergold: n/sneeed to bid this tight vul 3N whoch as cards lie should make|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 2@C probably stayman|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I doubt N can make 3nt after a @s lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: Small max will accept the invite which is on the way|pg||
nt|daman: he might be a legend in GB|pg||
mb|4H|nt|garnetts: Not sure if NS use a 12-14 1NT --but even so I think this hand needs upgrading --too good for 15-17|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good morning to Ed Shapiro|pg||
nt|othered1: Hi, everyone!|pg||
nt|roswolf: hi ED|pg||
nt|sybarra: hello Ed |pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: fantastic pass from West    winning action|pg||
mb|p|nt|blum1956: why not open weak 2@s? Or Multi? |pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes  12-14|pg||
nt|lestergold: er my son has a louder voice and is a lot bigger!|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: ok then very well known player :)|pg||
nt|daman: cool|pg||
nt|lestergold: he is originally from swedn and plays a great deal internationally especially the S|pg||
nt|lestergold: in the US|pg||
nt|Walddk4: You have never heard of Nevena Senior, George?|pg||
nt|pelu: but long way from US to Canada :)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|daman: Sure I have|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ralfwil: and for me a @s lead is natural as E|pg||
nt|lestergold: i c defence can establish 2 spades 2 clubs and a heart |pg||
nt|daman: sctoll up|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sybarra: should roll this one home,  not sure E can ever get in   |pg||
nt|roswolf: thyis looks like a make - west will be embarassed on the run of the minors|pg||
nt|lestergold: dim lead would let it thru|pg||
nt|daman: r*|pg||
nt|Walddk4: But you said you had not|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|haans: bidding today make them go to 3 level|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Strange lead|pg||
nt|garnetts: Likely think that it is too balanced and the suit is too weak at red|pg||
nt|sybarra: and clubs are 3/3 |pg||
nt|lestergold: am i seeing things here|pg||
nt|daman: scroll up|pg||
nt|Walddk4: oh, heard, sorry|pg||
pc|d8|nt|pelu: hi all|pg||
nt|blum1956: This leads to a probable disaster|pg||
nt|garnetts: Poor suit--more defensive than attacking|pg||
pc|d7|nt|daman: can't remember her maiden name|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dT|pg||
nt|daman: Demtinev or something like that|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Delova|pg||
nt|daman: hrrrrrmmmmm|pg||
mc|9|nt|mcarroll: Hi Peter|pg||
nt|lestergold: Townsend chos the  right time to pass but i would have thought an action with his big hand was noprmal like 3N|pg||
pg||
qx|c3|st||md|1SKJ984H72DQ643CT9,SHQJ95DAK2CAKQ862,SAT765H63DJT9CJ73,SQ32HAKT84D875C54|sv|e|nt|yo_yo: rotten start for the Hackett team|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed will be a test of their fortitude under pressure|pg||
nt|lestergold: I have seen Townsend pass in other auctions with massive hands where he should not have|pg||
nt|yo_yo: seems an odd pass to me|pg||
nt|daman: I have boxes of past issues of IPBM|pg||
nt|daman: delova doesn't ring a bell|pg||
nt|daman: yes    Deleva|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|garnetts: Both sides deserved to suffer for getting to 3NT--life is never fair lol|pg||
nt|yo_yo: the dreaded multi |pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: weak only version|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 11-15 at least  0  diamonds|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ady: sorry  seeing things  I tht diamonds 4-4 last hand|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but once again... if E had discarded @s6 he is discarding behind declarer|pg||
nt|lestergold: wellselway may take him seriously here and go too far|pg||
mb|2S|nt|Walddk2: Li Jie bid 5@D on his own next door|pg||
mb|4H|nt|Walddk2: Amazing auction really|pg||
nt|yo_yo: operator  can you explain the alerts?|pg||
nt|lestergold: hopwever  6@d is on ice|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 1@D   3@D   5@D  he bid. Partner was silent throughout|pg||
nt|sybarra: i guess you have to open that dog (4333)|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: will Gui give them 4@S?|pg||
nt|ady: well E/W do have 6@D|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh it worked they kept them out of the laydown slam |pg||
nt|daman: good stuff to reach game|pg||
pc|sK|nt|garnetts: I cannot see any reason to make 4@S  |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Denies 6 in a minor unless a 4-card major on the side|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@D can have 6 clubs|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: Scores from first stanza|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup not a good 13 count but an opening within the meaning of the Act|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: Teltscher 86 Hackett 29, Senior 13 Rosen 49, Hinden 35 Small 41, Crouch 40 de Botton 52|pg||
nt|yo_yo: the multi does seem to work |pg||
nt|lestergold: 19 combined but work to do|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sJ|nt|yo_yo: 2@D presumably asks for the better major|pg||
nt|garnetts: Yes|pg||
nt|blum1956: this time 3NT looks slightly better|pg||
nt|garnetts: East sees no reason to do anything other than bid 3NT--things are well placed for 4@H--best lead from North though |pg||
nt|garnetts: I meant 4@H not 3NT sorry|pg||
nt|sybarra: with W do you lead low ht or q? |pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: Small should have good 6 to bad 8|pg||
nt|daman: needs to duck this|pg||
nt|lestergold: 2 top losers and 2 out  of 3 black losers in Hallberg's hand which need to be disposed of one way or the other|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|roswolf: well a good club view would help the cause of n/s|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|haans: had myself bid 4@C |pg||
nt|garnetts: might on a club lead even then not certain |pg||
nt|garnetts: I like 4@C as it helps partner to judge --but usually is shows more length doesn't it?  |pg||
nt|roswolf: Q in pards bid suit i think|pg||
nt|lestergold: at these colours there is a lot of equity in messing up the u]auction as n/s have done|pg||
pc|sT|nt|sybarra: this pickles you pard |pg||
pc|s7|nt|haans: we can talk about that :)|pg||
nt|pelu: no 4@C = fit to @D and values in @C|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
pc|c4|nt|lestergold: a trump attack was needed|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: Sorry first time at this|pg||
nt|daman: he is gin for game|pg||
nt|daman: can make 5 really|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes he is lucky here can ruff 2 losers in dummy and just about negotiate |pg||
nt|daman: yes   maybe only makes 4    not enough soldiers for an overtrick|pg||
nt|lestergold: has to be careful when returning to hand ruffing the third@d|pg||
nt|lestergold: however has no choice as @da drops|pg||
nt|pelu: on @DK he can discard the last @S-loser - so give up 2 @Hs - but has to take @HA|pg||
mc|12|nt|garnetts: 4@S is very poorly disciplined |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Excellent judgement by Gui. 4@S is as dead as a dead chruch rat|pg||
nt|Walddk2: church  even|pg||
nt|garnetts: ask partner for a view and then ignore it--this hsould be a slam try sequence |pg||
nt|mcarroll: interesting metaphor|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Even if you guess hearts (you don't), it's 1 down|pg||
nt|sybarra: I lead the Q but who am I ?|pg||
nt|pelu: I dont beligve 12 - but 10!|pg||
nt|daman:     not 680|pg||
nt|lestergold: plus 1 i was expecting plus 2 imposs|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: Soryy result not right|pg||
nt|daman: maybe 620|pg||
nt|lestergold: 650 my guess|pg||
nt|pelu: 11 impossible|pg||
nt|daman: I think he has to lose a @S in the wash|pg||
nt|pelu: u cant place 3 black losers om two @Hs|pg||
pg||

nt|lestergold: Small is having a field day at the wheel|pg||
nt|yo_yo: mind you a weak 2 would have worked equally well |pg||
nt|lestergold: of course its no0t a victory for the multi as such merely a victory for the barrage that took place|pg||
nt|lestergold: or maybe a lowly trump promoted in south |pg||
nt|daman: 3NT for EW? |pg||
nt|daman: being aggressive?|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: SZ thinking about digging graves|pg||
nt|ady: part score here    likley 1NT e/w|pg||
nt|pelu: now the hand is scored as -1?|pg||
nt|vugraphzdb: -1 is right|pg||
nt|lestergold: which hand? the last?|pg||
nt|pelu: how?|pg||
mb|p|mb|1N|nt|Walddk2: 5@H!? What a strange choice|pg||
nt|mcarroll: This mountain that SZ had to climb is suddenly taking on the appearance of Everest|pg||
nt|garnetts: Cannot think how West declared 5@H next door |pg||
nt|garnetts: I suppose that with the TOD west thought east had four |pg||
nt|daman: I think you might look at their card Nicky|pg||
mb|p|mb|3N|nt|Walddk2: This is funny. Yang psyched a pass over the Multi|pg||
nt|sybarra: bd 1,  e/w lost an imp here|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Results from round 1: Rosen v Senior 25-4 ; Teltscher v P Hackett 19-11 ; Small v Hinden 17-13, and de Botton v Crouch 16-14|pg||
nt|daman: ask them the result|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: agressive non bidding|pg||
nt|garnetts: No auction given in the movie|pg||
mb|p|nt|blum1956: again the 3NT-4 Major choice|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: diamond lead beats this|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ralfwil: 4@h is better than 4@s. time enough to find the @c ruff|pg||
nt|lestergold: so the rosen team fresh from having given the senior team a serious pasting|pg||
nt|ady: wrong red suit|pg||
nt|lestergold: ht lead i predict|pg||
nt|daman: would we all have bid 3NT with 3334 9 count?|pg||
nt|daman: I have been told that -1 was claimed at the table|pg||
nt|lestergold: Hallberg still has his workl cut out for 9 tricks|pg||
nt|daman: from someone who is at the table|pg||
nt|lestergold: there are two tens i think normal to bid vul game at ips with west's hand|pg||
pc|hT|nt|daman: maybe she was swayed by her two 10's|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes a spade lead|pg||
pc|d7|pc|d2|nt|yo_yo: bakhshi has to alert  as he could have a longer @D suit|pg||
nt|ady: may get to 4@H    needs club lead  to definately beat it|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|Walddk2: 4@H also made in the other room on board 1, with an overtrick even|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|garnetts: this might beat it too|pg||
pc|s2|nt|haans: SZ scores :)|pg||
nt|pelu: I exp that the bidding in CR is so strange, that the operator dont wont to give it :)|pg||
pc|s6|pc|s9|nt|lestergold: @d switch good enuf?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: the teltscher team seemed to be way in front  yesterday|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|yo_yo: this will be a quick match|pg||
nt|lestergold: Halberg will make it with the help from the lead now|pg||
pc|d8|nt|lestergold: has time to try the club as well|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ady: spade lead also enough    only one discard of a club  so down 1|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|Walddk2: A spade was led to the ace and one returned. Curtains|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|s4|nt|daman: he almost has to fall into it now    no?|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|sybarra: was so much easier to beat the hand from this vantage point |pg||
pc|sK|nt|Walddk2: I am told that the contract was 6@C and not 5@H|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|roswolf: but after the great lead the follow-up was disappointing|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In the open room, Whittaker reasonably played partner for a singleton spade rather than @CA after West bid game|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Can't fault him|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|Walddk2: Anyway, something went 2 down|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c4|pc|c2|pg||
pc|d4|nt|garnetts: I am suprised to hear that :)  |pg||
pc|dT|pc|dK|nt|Walddk2: Whittaker also from Scotland originally|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|nt|yo_yo: no, not clear|pg||

nt|daman: nope  The Garve saved us from that|pg||
nt|lestergold: with garvey around you cant be sure|pg||
mb|2C|nt|garnetts: No--but the Q@C seemed a very rapid play |pg||
nt|blum1956: not an easy decision for North spade lead probably made from J10|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: apparently david gold still contemplating the @SA|pg||
nt|garnetts: In my view too fast to work out options |pg||
mb|2S!|nt|Walddk2: I can make 3NT here. Impressed?|pg||
nt|daman: 3 card drury?|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: a third in hand opening but 1nt looks bold at these colours and with a sketchy stop|pg||
nt|othered1: Agree|pg||
nt|lestergold: that is the wildness of garvey at unfavouravle vul he makes a bid that many of us wouldnt even do at favourable|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|haans: no :)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|daman: once you have a reputation...it is difficult to deviate|pg||
nt|lestergold: but he will get a plus score on this occasion for his efforts|pg||

pc|hA|nt|Walddk2: You can't sit still with a 17 count|pg||
nt|yo_yo: a quick one down?|pg||
nt|lestergold: a push i expect|pg||
nt|ady: this should go ddown on the lay    3NT  may have mad with Q@D right though a an unlikely club lead would beat it|pg||
nt|yo_yo: the weak No trumpers might bid it 1NT - 3NT|pg||
pc|h9|nt|yo_yo: no a quick 2 down|pg||
nt|lestergold: a passive lead mind you would let it thru but unlikely|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|lestergold: work to do but the lead has created a trick and the spades are playabel for one loser|pg||
pc|h7|nt|pelu: yes Roland - and I can make 6 on a non-@c-lead :)|pg||
nt|garnetts: I would have been more impressed if you could have made 6@C on the last hand|pg||
nt|lestergold: well dangerous weak 2 with 6 solid tricks in ones hand|pg||
pc|h3|pc|hJ|nt|roswolf: blood will flow but whose it is not clear|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2NT asked East to choose a minor|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And Crouch knows that diamonds 5-0 now after the double|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He will play the hand accordingly|pg||
nt|sybarra: or maybe 4441 |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nah|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He would never double with that hand|pg||
nt|othered1: Mightn't he think north may be thinking that south had something for the vulnerable opening bid, even 3rd hand?|pg||
nt|lestergold: sorry what amn i talking about 2 off|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|lestergold: hard for partner to read this|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT can only make on a spade lead which is likely|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ralfwil: yes and the side suit is @h!|pg||
nt|lestergold: even a @d trick may be created  as they lie|pg||
pc|h8|nt|haans: two yes for one no :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Crouch knows that Tosh has nothing. Otherwise North has no double|pg||
nt|sybarra: except with no @D lead, maybe shows S has none?|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes north cant be faulted but south will be ashamed|pg||
nt|othered1: Good pint, Shirley|pg||
nt|othered1: point|pg||
nt|roswolf: that is on the way|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Pint sounds OK|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe the pint is better at this hour for us|pg||
nt|sybarra: 940 am here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It may need a heart switch now|pg||
nt|roswolf: indeed someone eill need a blood transfusion after this|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|yo_yo: @S lead would have beaten this |pg||
nt|yo_yo: ooops  Gold did return a low @S|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
pc|d5|nt|garnetts: I was wondering what their methods were over 1NT  ---tempting to bid if you get both suits in |pg||
pc|d6|pc|dJ|nt|lestergold: that is a textbook error of course|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|c6|nt|yo_yo: another 13 imps to Teltscher|pg||
nt|lestergold: i dont think 3N is a likely spot here|pg||
nt|daman: Mike    I have noticed a marked imrpovement with your spelling    are you dating a Grammar teacher?    or are you just typing slower?    lol|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sybarra: E has to NOT play trumps |pg||
nt|Walddk2: If Crouch reads this, North can be endplayed to lead away from @HK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That is why a heart switch was needed at trick 2|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes cash out the side suits|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But he has to guess North's shape|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2 hearts and 3 clubs, or the other way round|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He is certain re diamonds|pg||
pc|c3|nt|yo_yo: 12 imps|pg||
nt|ralfwil: you are very kind Mike!|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i never heard of a weak 2  8-12|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|roswolf: assuming the 5-0 trump split playing clubs which is the natural thing to do will make the positiom clear|pg||

pc|d7|nt|garnetts: On the last hand I really like the pass of 2@D --an intelligent psych |pg||
nt|lestergold: this doesnt make sense|pg||
nt|daman: tell us a bit about the 4some at the other table Mike|pg||
nt|lestergold: surely that club wasnt ducked by the defence|pg||
mc|7|nt|Walddk2: Now it is again|pg||
nt|roswolf: but that was a clear error by north|pg||
nt|sybarra: ace and a @H now?|pg||
nt|othered1: south did echo in @C|pg||
nt|sybarra: does that help?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Or a diamond to confirm the layout|pg||
nt|roswolf: north will be endplayed twice|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Then it is also easy|pg||
nt|othered1: And east's double of 2@S had to be on more than just the @HA|pg||

pc|s2|pc|s6|pc|sJ|pc|sA|pg||
pc|h3|nt|athene: notice how it's slightly more deceptive to win the first trick with the @HK there rather than the ace|pg||
pc|h8|nt|athene: i suit contracts, as declarer, you generally win with your highest card to conceal information|pg||
pc|hT|pc|h9|pg||
nt|athene: but againt NT, the king there can deceive both defenders|pg||

pc|c3|pc|c9|pc|cQ|pc|cK|pg||

pc|d4|pg||
nt|patricck: If they could see all the cards I think EW could have made 2@H even after 3 rounds of trumps, but neither of them had a way into the bidding against a weak NT opening |pg||

mb|1C|nt|athene: north will probably respond 1@H|pg||
nt|roswolf: this is a tricky hand|pg||
nt|patricck: yes, one imp at the most|pg||
nt|athene: E-W will certainly go to 4@S|pg||
mb|p|mb|2C|mb|2S|nt|roswolf: and n/s to 5@C|pg||
nt|athene: ok, he bid 2@C rather than 1@H - very sensible|pg||
nt|athene: a lot of 5-card major players would bid a heart|pg||
nt|patricck: 5@C has the same losers that 4@H does tho|pg||
mb|3S|nt|athene: but when you have a fit in clubs, you know you are battling against the spades anyway|pg||
mb|4S|nt|athene: so hearts don't rank any higher than clubs|pg||

pc|s9|pc|sQ|pc|s6|pg||
nt|athene: king might have doubled this, with his @HKQx over the stronger hand|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dK|nt|athene: the defence just have to beware of an elimination, with west getting endplayed |pg||
pc|d8|pc|d2|pg||
nt|roswolf: not to many game axe doubles these days|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c8|nt|patricck: As a kib has just pointed out 5@C plays better, because if east doesn't lead hearts through early there may be an endplay|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c4|pg||
nt|athene: e.g. if south knocks out the @DA and East carelessly plays a second spade|pg||
nt|patricck: last chance will be when in with A@D|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can strip the diamonds and play a heart, and west loses his second heart trick|pg||
pc|c3|pc|s4|pc|cQ|pc|c6|pg||
nt|athene: but east only has to put a heart through once when west has a safe exit|pg||
nt|athene: but still if he fears declarer has a second spade loser and the @S10 is going on a diamond|pg||
nt|athene: he might try cashing the spade|pg||
nt|roswolf: sandra is trying to create an illusion|pg||
nt|athene: this is where it really matters to know how many spades your partner has|pg||
nt|athene: i don't see how west could bid 4@S with only three spades|pg||

mb|2N!|an|GF with LongDias or 4Spades|nt|roswolf: well south can spring an ambush soon|pg||
nt|athene: south isn't going to do any springing in the auction, although she might hope to do some in the defence |pg||
nt|patricck: The best slam seeing only the EW hands would be 6@C by West because that only needs the @H finesse. But curiously that is the only slam that can be beaten on htis layout|pg||
mb|3D|mb|3N|nt|roswolf: i know my sandra|pg||
nt|athene: if east had rebid 1nt that would be 18-20, i think|pg||
nt|roswolf: she is very agressive but a lovely lady and delightful teammate|pg||
nt|athene: so 2nt is a spade raise or maybe various hands including a spade raise|pg||
nt|athene: ok i'm told 2nt is 18-20 balanced with 4 spades|pg||
nt|athene: that makes sense|pg||
nt|roswolf: east now has a judgment problem but i expect he will try some science|pg||
nt|athene: so 3nt is "serious" i guess|pg||
nt|patricck: South's delayed 3@D bid has allowed EW to find out more information and allowed West to look favourably on the K@D|pg||
nt|athene: he can't possibly be any better as a passed hand|pg||
nt|athene: when opps play 1minor very loose like this i think it's best to play the cue overcall as natural|pg||
nt|roswolf: nevena and gunnar in the other room might well bid the slam|pg||
nt|patricck: better would be K@H and a singleton diamond|pg||
nt|roswolf: that is why east has a problem - how to find out?|pg||
nt|athene: i don't see how east can have slam ambition facing a passed hand, really|pg||
nt|roswolf: the big spade fit is the key|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|roswolf: east clucks out|pg||
nt|athene: wow|pg||
nt|athene: it's tempting to suggest they didn't know what they were doing here|pg||
nt|vugraphzda: Nothing offered in respect of 3N|pg||
nt|athene: you don't usually pick 3nt over 4@S with a known big diamond suit getting led|pg||
nt|roswolf: I would have bid 4@C |pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dK|pc|d5|pc|d2|pg||
pc|c3|pc|c6|pc|cA|nt|athene: of course, the misunderstanding can be a double disaster here in that if west actually has the hand where slam is good (singleton diamond, @SAK, @HK) you are going down a million ...|pg||

pc|cJ|pc|d4|pc|c9|pc|d8|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|roswolf: declarer may well eschew the @H finesse|pg||
nt|athene: as the Hog remarked - conventions create confusion|pg||
nt|patricck: declarer will end up taking the @H finesse for 690. If South had AQJxxx @D and the K@H there probably would have been an immediate bid|pg||
nt|vugraphzda: sandra asking about range|pg||
pc|d6|pc|s4|pc|s2|pg||
