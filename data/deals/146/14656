nt|odysseus69: Bocchi got 2H bid in before Townsend could|pg||
nt|odysseus69: I suspect that may have been catch-up for Vugraph|pg||
pc|s3|nt|yuval10: N in the OR also opened 1@h |pg||
nt|ralfwil: I think it´s a she Mike|pg||
nt|odysseus69: trump lead|pg||
pc|s2|nt|yannis3012: begining with a difficult 3nt to make|pg||
nt|star6ija: 17-18 direct 1 N, 19-20 via 1h|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: well they scaped from that one |pg||
nt|ralfwil: the only positive for ns is that it´s undoubled|pg||
nt|oleberg: 3 down could be possible, but requires accurate defence|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: all the key cards are badly placed K@H,K@S,AQ@C|pg||
pc|sT|nt|peachy: EW system is 4-card majors, light style 14-16 and 15-17NT. NS is Transfer Walsh 15-17NT|pg||
nt|athene: tricky hand to play - ruffing diamond finesse is a possibility|pg||
nt|bagman: There are lot's of high cards out and E passed and W opened weak|pg||
nt|athene: the problem is that ruffing diamond finesse might not be that useful, even if the king is with east|pg||
nt|athene: because if the @DQ is covered you have to use the @CA to get back there for a fast pitch of the heart|pg||
nt|athene: and that gives up on a double club finesse|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer wants a quick discards and wants to play the clubs for one loser|pg||
nt|athene: it's possible he might put all his eggs in one basket and take a normal diamond finesse; i.e. lead to the queen|pg||
nt|bagman: W  has shown up with @HKQ, does he have @DK and @CH?|pg||
nt|athene: the other issue is, you aren't necessarily going all-out to make|pg||
nt|athene: if it risks incurring two or three additional vulnerable undertricks|pg||
nt|bagman: S vulnerable he needs to make as many tricks as possible unless he has 9 safe|pg||
nt|bagman: He has likely 3 spade losers and a club|pg||
nt|athene: not at all an easy decision for south here|pg||
nt|athene: i prefer to open these hands 2@S first time|pg||
nt|athene: passing might appear safer but you often end up having to take more of a risk later at a higher level|pg||
nt|bagman: If he takes the straight diamond finesse, he needs to play @S to the Q|pg||
nt|athene: he knows the points are split fairly evenly between east and west|pg||
nt|bagman: Hoping for Jx KQxxx Kxx Qx or similar leaving E AKx xx xxx Kxx|pg||
nt|athene: west has weak-2 and east can't open - that doesn't leave much room for variation, with 21 hcp missing|pg||
nt|athene: the only problem is, there are a lot of variations in which cards each defender has|pg||
nt|bagman: If he places KQ of hearts and @DK west, he is quite restricted to place the rest for a make|pg||
nt|andreasw:  only lead is @S if u dont want to give any trick's|pg||
nt|haans: South do not liked it|pg||
nt|othered1: hi!|pg||
nt|lesniak: teraz musza zmienic na kiera|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|lmeili: 4N shows 6 4?|pg||
nt|ziff:  Looks like the par contract|pg||
nt|yuval10: so no swing in a rather dangerous board |pg||
nt|yuval10: Israeli open for instance opened 1@c and played it wrong-sidedly, going down 1|pg||
nt|aldek: it can be made, but unlikely|pg||
nt|cameron_1: yes|pg||
nt|mdgraham: looking at the banner, you can be dead certain|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the W is a clue|pg||
pc|cA|nt|roswolf: another thinnish game reached|pg||
nt|haans: landed fair|pg||
nt|poohbear: trump lead and its over|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: yes not easy|pg||
nt|haans: Hi Barry wlc|pg||
nt|poohbear: sorry|pg||
nt|poohbear: dont mean to chat|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: hi barry|pg||
nt|udo: 4 @H fails , even finding @H Queen doubleton is not enough|pg||
nt|udo: no entries for the 2 top-spades for diamond discards|pg||
nt|brolucius: East expects six hearts for a 2@H rebid that bypasses so many alternative rebid. Hence the raise.|pg||
nt|udo: hm, only 2 clublooses|pg||
nt|udo: losers|pg||
nt|othered1: with @CJ on, this does make (6@H, 2@S, 1@D, 1@C)|pg||
nt|udo: small @H to jack will be enough|pg||
nt|othered1: or win in dummy, pitch @C, hook rounded suits|pg||
nt|othered1: sorry, pitch @D|pg||
nt|udo: or 2 discards after heart to the jack|pg||
nt|othered1: (Ignore me, I'll awaken shortly)|pg||
nt|udo: jack of clubs is the important card, and it is well placed|pg||
nt|udo: same here:)|pg||
nt|udo: good morning ED:)|pg||
nt|tomi2:  I think they should not have bid that game, IMO east should have passed 2@H|pg||
nt|brolucius: At last I have managed to find a Lauria-Versace convention card. The 2NT response on Board 1 was a limit bid in partner's major. More often nowadays, 2NT shows a game-forcing ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: raise.|pg||
nt|8252: les 2 derniers matche sdes français comptent donc double, puisque Bulgare et allemands seront au tour suivant|pg||
nt|ralfwil: except @dK:)|pg||
nt|oleberg: A switch to the @DQ is the first step towards -3|pg||

nt|brolucius: Duck, I expect, to set up the @HJ (or avoid losing a trump trick). Unlikely that they would duck @HQ - but possible at this level.|pg||

nt|lesh: the small spade makes no sense|pg||
nt|h_karluk: I think today is Monday June 28, 2010, so obviously not April one, whatever|pg||
nt|justin c: if South's double was penalty, no reason for N to remove it that I can see|pg||
nt|babs59: isn't it now 18-19 based on inflation?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|aap00: playing @dQ, not 10 correct - you can discard 3d @d by @c|pg||

nt|star6ija: that is the question|pg||
nt|lesh: what it seems to be a flat board turn out to be a possible swing|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: real danger of an endplay here, I think a @s discard instead of a @d would have been better|pg||

nt|jkotor: na drugim stole 5@d bez X, nadróbka cenna :)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|brolucius: Those who play a 2@D response as game-forcing, will presumably have to respond 1NT on those North cards.|pg||
pc|d8|nt|rigas_karo: still|pg||
nt|yannis3012: yes. greek women are losing 10-0 after three boards from russia , one of the favourites|pg||
nt|andersk: -2 for a push|pg||
nt|ady: going down|pg||
nt|shevek: yes, a bid of 3@c/@d or@h over 2NT would show a Max with a shortage|pg||
nt|MolvaM: I see several 4s making with this board in other matches|pg||
nt|andreasw:  i have seen worse 2@s opening before|pg||
nt|brolucius: It may seem a bit light to bid 2NT on a 10-count, but both responders were allowing for six trick-producing hearts ion the opener's hand.|pg||

nt|xenya: but it's odds in to play for the actual spade disitribution|pg||

nt|andersk: Croatia NS aggressive style|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: hand 2 3@D contract also & same lead 4@D |pg||
nt|haans: Fallenius do no like it|pg||
nt|brolucius: Brogeland plays the 2@D is game-forcing unless there is a 3@D rebid.|pg||
pc|c8|nt|eweber: the open series is being played in two groups for a whole week|pg||

nt|jameslee 2: no move after openning |pg||

nt|snetram:  zabawne|pg||

nt|mdgraham: first blood to Sweden on board 1 - the Swedish EW made 6@s|pg||
nt|odysseus69: cant get to 3NT now- |pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@D looks to be to play opposite a weak two in diamonds - however one suspects a crossed wire|pg||
pc|c2|nt|andersk: I beleve 2 @C is drury with 3 card|pg||
nt|aap00: no cards for 6 |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 2@S shape & points |pg||
nt|justin c: as a passed hand, West might have stretched to 2@D |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: first duck from declarer to open comunication |pg||
nt|oleberg: Declarer will probaly try to "scramble"; getting his small thrumphs home|pg||
pc|c3|nt|eweber: and of those 10 teams 6+NL will play in the Bermuda Bowl|pg||
nt|andersk: Has to switch @D or @C noe, I predeict @D|pg||
nt|ady: this needed a major suit lead |pg||
nt|kdr_fm: nothing breaking (well @C 5/4) this is going off a few|pg||
nt|oleberg: Instead of trying to drawthrumphs, and control the hand|pg||
nt|odysseus69: no|pg||
pc|cA|pg||

nt|jameslee 2: 3@H  6 card |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 4@H end |pg||
nt|lesh: unfortunately for E/W 4@s is making|pg||
nt|barnets: 5@D would be a good save down just 1|pg||
nt|brolucius: The doubletons in spades, also the vulnerability, are a deterrent.|pg||
nt|bagman: The defense has 4 tricks but they have not the means to take them (3 clubs and a heart)|pg||
nt|brolucius: The 2-2 spade break will now be helpful to declarer, providing an entry to the long hearts.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Murray lost first set|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer ruffs this, draws two rounds of trumps with QJ and starts hearts|pg||
nt|babs59: strange lead v. 4@C??|pg||
nt|odysseus69: and a strange lead-cant believe it|pg||

nt|MolvaM: running scores http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/runningscores/asp/roundteamsconditstatclassicmod.asp?qtournid=819&qshowflag=1|pg||
nt|MolvaM: norths 2@c could be the gazilli convention that several pairs play these days|pg||
nt|MolvaM: showing either a natural @c rebid or some sort of strong hand|pg||
nt|ftpe: hearts 5-2, so only 5 spades here|pg||
nt|aap00: so 4 is reasonable contract|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer has some sort of chance to ditch a diamond on one of the black suits. A diamond finesse and a heart break would then give him a chance.|pg||
nt|brolucius: South's signal on the top-club lead deterred Lauria from cashing his other high club, thereby giving declarer a diamond discard. Buit the @DK is wrong anyway.|pg||

nt|othered1: it's difficult to stay out of this game, unless west opens strong NT and east chooses not to act, vulnerable.|pg||
nt|lesh: should take much longer before claiming|pg||
nt|andersk: Kinda stragne 2 @C and 4@H bid from Charlie here, I would prefeer 4@H over 1 @H opening, isnt that what the hand is wurth?|pg||
nt|lesh: certainly 4@H would do the job. I dont think North would dbl|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this might make, or it might go down - that covers most possibilities |pg||
nt|mdgraham: but should make now, even if NS get a spade ruff, as a diamond can be discarded on @CK|pg||
nt|ralfwil: walter the valrus had made this easy - double with a voice of thunder - (Mollo)|pg||

nt|andreasw:  3nt 11 trick's finessing @d|pg||
nt|othered1: i.e, it's a game virtually everyone will get to|pg||
nt|mdgraham: perhaps the real contract is 3NT|pg||
pc|d6|nt|athene: lauria's negative double over 2@D warned south off getting involved with his spade suit|pg||
nt|oleberg: Then again, he might not :)|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: bad news has arrived from the trumps|pg||
nt|oleberg: Nridge is easier, when you can see all four hands|pg||
pc|d5|nt|aap00: for me strange, with 10hcp and passed pd |pg||
nt|haans: not easy clubs finesse|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|lmeili: if S ducks @dA|pg||
nt|bagman: I would guess that declarer discards a club on the hearts and gives 2 spades and 2 hearts|pg||
nt|athene: Sementa is prepared to lose his @HK to hold declarer to one heart winner rather than two|pg||
nt|bagman: Sementa's duck gives defense 3 spades instead of 2 spades|pg||
nt|brolucius: A high spot-card (@C7) is discouraging, against both suit and NT contracts. (Reverse attitude).|pg||
nt|justin c: leaving the @C suit blocked to keep entry to @HQJ|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a @s lead was defeating|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mcarroll: I agree - lets the defence signal very comfortably|pg||
nt|h_karluk: the only possibility to make this a thrown-in play with misdefense of West|pg||
nt|aap00: so, "well deserved" -5 impls|pg||
pc|s6|nt|haans: @H6 even|pg||
nt|odysseus69: I hate that 2C option - it just interferes with big hand with too little damage to oppo on weak hands|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|peachy: NS 1H opening might not be everybody's choice, but they play 4-card majors, light style|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: he will ruff a @H & open the clubs guess !|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer keeps the @SA as an entry in case he needs to finesse E for @HT|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|peachy: oops, he overcalled!|pg||
nt|ziff:  I must confess that I would not sell the E hand as 9+, but Entscho s judgement has always been somewhat different....|pg||
nt|h_karluk: pitch the spade and lose the board|pg||
nt|mdgraham: can you shed any light please operator?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|MolvaM: this is a 630 or 660 hand for the field to rest their grey cells|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Thor Erik was in San Remo 2009, i guess evil made him do that double|pg||
pc|h2|nt|andersk: will probably go down|pg||
nt|oleberg: Well, a double with a voice of thunder might not have been good. It might make if nort's strength is known|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|athene: he will carry on with the time-honoured antidote to a 4-4 trump fit - keep leading trumps|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer can play N to have AQx and make now 10 tricks|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|peachy: ignore everything I said, please :)|pg||
nt|bagman: Or W can let N to have @SQ|pg||
nt|athene: declarer probably thinks the club is offside|pg||
nt|athene: he will try and endplay north|pg||
nt|athene: duck another spade now, perhaps|pg||
nt|bagman: The @C-finesse working is an extra bonus|pg||
nt|andersk: maybe, I cant see what damage ¤@H direct might couse|pg||
mc|11|nt|xenya: i'm told there are no commentators in the open room, so I think i'll switch over there|pg||
nt|ftpe: now he plays safe|pg||
nt|aap00: oh, yes me too |pg||
nt|kdr_fm: W praying that @dT9 .... arghhh :>|pg||
nt|barnets: perhaps the hackets will bid 5@D they like to bid|pg||
nt|babs59: I dislike mixing strong bids and weak bids... as with the multi 2@D having a strong option.  That also hinders the preemptive nature of the 2@D multi |pg||

nt|shevek: coffee hand, brb :)|pg||
nt|jkotor: operator, do we know 3@c meaning?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but will S be quiet?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Quite common to play that two of a major via Stayman is invitational now. That restricts the option of bidding 2@C on South's shape.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: some advocate Stayman with 4-4 knowing at least a 4-3 fit - would not have been good idea here|pg||
nt|bagman: South has enough to be dummy in NT; no need to look for an 'escape'|pg||
nt|barnets: does not look north is destined for success here|pg||
mb|p|nt|eweber: 2@c precision style again|pg||

nt|cameron_1: i was referign to David's initial choice of 2@c rather than X|pg||

nt|haans: 3@C full of danger|pg||
nt|haans: 2@D may have been trf|pg||
nt|haans: more logical|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: not in this position |pg||
nt|haans: but bidding @D twice is?|pg||

nt|jameslee 2: hi |pg||
nt|haans: only 40 hcp exist|pg||
nt|psridhar: two high class pairs facing each other -should be an absorbing contest|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 5@D can be made true will see where he ends up|pg||
mb|3C|nt|rnmalik: but for the @S finesse had a good chance to make it.|pg||
nt|roswolf: never likely to be bid though|pg||
nt|brolucius: You see how light South's 2@S response is. Everyone does that nowadays, to allow partner to compete if he has extra trump-length. In the Bad Old Days, a raise to 2@S was considered ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: a 'free bid' (particularly in the USA) and promised a king's ransom.|pg||
nt|udo: and 4 @S NS  |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 3@D= bergen |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 4@S = 10/11 tricks |pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: if thats not a minimum hand I never saw one|pg||
nt|davidb: normal  450 . will be flat all over I believe|pg||

mb|3D|nt|mcarroll: Lebensohl|pg||
nt|andersk: must be the best weak 2 ever|pg||
nt|yuval10: 4+|pg||
nt|tomi2:  Hackett raised to 3@S with only 3 cad support. I play a cuebid by overcaller as 3 card support raise with maximum here, so 3@S would always be 4 cards for me|pg||
nt|yuval10: seem like a nice agreement|pg||
nt|yuval10: you have to play over the @h's in 4@s|pg||

nt|mamos: this all looks odd|pg||
nt|MolvaM: while the results from their own group will be carried over|pg||
nt|xenya: well if N just had @HA instead of the King... |pg||
nt|lesh: 2@c prec, 2@s non forcing.However South has a decent hand he tried 4@s|pg||

nt|motu: i guess i would lead a@H|pg||
nt|tomi2:  seems like a good idea too, in case S has also a singleton you cut this communication|pg||

nt|Gerben42: Rudakov removed because of the @S problem, not because of his good suit|pg||
nt|wygbe1: play off 3 top clubs pitching h's and let e ruff|pg||
nt|peachy: declarer is likely to adopt that line, but then he has to deal with the H, S and club losers in hand|pg||
nt|peachy: might turn out too tuff|pg||
nt|wygbe1: yes, the line that works is to just ruff the 2 low clubs in dummy and draw trumps, finessing against d jack|pg||
nt|wygbe1: even that could run into difficulty|pg||
nt|h_karluk: oh yes, now i liked more Lawrence's Law of total tricks |pg||
nt|odysseus69: as a founder member of the multi society I suggest including only strong 4-4-4-1 hands as the only strong option|pg||
nt|odysseus69: will do well to find a way to 9 tricks here|pg||

nt|yuval10: and now for a goulash hand|pg||
nt|tomi2:  I think 1@C is 2+@C for the German pair|pg||
nt|bagman: In the late 80's  passing out a deal was nearly impossible|pg||
nt|athene: EW might be able to create some confusion|pg||
nt|athene: with 11 -card spade fit|pg||
nt|antoniz: odzyskujemy przewagê psychiczn¹:)|pg||

nt|h_karluk: echo|pg||
nt|lechcold: przed 13 jest..poszli na wodê jednak:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: weak 2 in @D|pg||
nt|Gerben42: refreshingly natural|pg||
nt|eweber: there is a tiny little chance of an endplay vs South|pg||
nt|wygbe1: guess i missed something, down 1 looked pretty easy|pg||
nt|yuval10: really hard to predict what the final outcome here will be|pg||
nt|tomi2:  am no fan of double and no fan of redouble here. what contract does Della Monta want to play doubled, iff ops bid it?|pg||
nt|yuval10: X from S is dangerous in the sense that sometimes P will pass and you have very few defensive tricks for him|pg||
nt|tomi2:  yes|pg||
nt|roswolf: another straightforward board|pg||
nt|bagman: p-p|pg||
nt|athene: 2@S must be a takeout |pg||
nt|bagman: S is confident in his methods|pg||
nt|athene: takeout of spades|pg||
nt|fokal: 2@d shows @s , strong or weak|pg||
nt|fokal: hi all by the way|pg||
nt|athene: maybe 2@S is specifically michaels|pg||
nt|bagman: Is it T/O or 2-suiter?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi.|pg||
nt|athene: many pairs play "leaping michaels" over these bids, so 4@D would be reds|pg||
nt|bagman: hi|pg||
nt|fokal: so I guess 2@s shows a two suiters for sure|pg||
nt|athene: maybe NS don't play that or maybe south prefers to treat his hand as a 3-suiter|pg||
nt|bagman: N has an easy raise of the q-bid :)|pg||
nt|bagman: if methods permit such treatment|pg||
nt|hawe45:  So - I was late from another match|pg||
nt|athene: north pretty much just wants to RKCB in hearts|pg||
nt|athene: but he might have to set hearts first|pg||
nt|MolvaM: double now?|pg||
nt|andreasw:  1@s and 4@h after 3nt|pg||
nt|udo: 7@D|pg||
nt|udo: or NT|pg||
nt|udo: lets see|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is natural to bid 4@H rather than 5@C because it is a trick less. When the opponents go to 4@S and you want to bid at the five-level, you have a free choice between hearts and ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: clubs.|pg||
nt|8252: tu as donc 2 pseudos|pg||
nt|ralfwil: As you said Mike a classic preempt with a good result|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: denmark on lead 8-0 Iceland|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: hand nº 6 |pg||
nt|oleberg: 1@D shows 11-15, 4+ diamonds, can have longer clubs|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: seems a 4@H by West|pg||
nt|oleberg: (No, I'm not guessing :))|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this 3N is a bit easier|pg||
mb|1S|nt|yuval10: i agree with those 2 arguments you made|pg||
nt|shevek: neither side can make game|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 3nt seems not makable|pg||
nt|tomi2:  lauria only needs to find partner with two aces here, should be possible to find|pg||
mb|p|nt|ziff:  In a marked contrast to our table Scotland and Italy have won 40 and 46 IMP in 5 boards.....|pg||
nt|lmeili: they should reach to 4@h, 1@c-1@d , 1N 2@c|pg||
nt|tomi2:  sometimes pd will jump to 2 level with 4 cards only and you have a hard bidding later|pg||
nt|tomi2:  os della Monatas hand now worth a raise to 6?|pg||
nt|yuval10: i believe W must add now....P is willing to play in the 5 level ALONE when he's VUL, and you have AK A?|pg||
nt|tomi2:  AKtx of trumps and the ace in their suit?|pg||
nt|yuval10: *she's|pg||
nt|yuval10: very likely that we'll see a sacrifice from NS|pg||
nt|tomi2:  if S bids 5@D now w has a difficult bid|pg||
nt|yuval10: Pass forcing?|pg||
nt|tomi2:  E-W are clearly in a forcing pass situation, but do you pass with TWO small dias?|pg||
nt|roswolf: unless n/s get carried away|pg||
nt|davidb: yes  no  great  boards yet...|pg||
nt|ady: can make 6NT    6@S  beaten on heart lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: the axe might descend here|pg||
nt|davidb: ??  aces...|pg||
nt|bagman: Ok, now let's see how the void is shown|pg||
nt|cameron_1: might chooce 4@s since Drijver's X was prob snapfragon style i.e. 2@s 5@c|pg||
nt|aldek: double showing clubs and a doubleton spade|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@D is natural. She has one diamond, so opens One Diamond.|pg||
nt|oleberg: And a good save in 4@S|pg||
nt|oleberg: Ok, a save|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: a block 3@S by N|pg||
nt|brolucius: Well, it was quite interesting how Gold approached the play - attacking his weakest suit first. |pg||
nt|odysseus69: a boring looking affair here|pg||
nt|odysseus69: can they look for a slam?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: dont think so|pg||
mb|2D|nt|athene: it's never easy to bid a grand slam which depends on a void (i.e. where you are off an ace)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: still a possible 5 imps missed|pg||
mb|p|nt|eweber: but NS can escape by cashing their tricks|pg||
nt|lmeili: 2@h 3@h|pg||
nt|haans: close to spade raise|pg||
nt|yuval10: you have to do something with this AKTX trump and A@h|pg||
nt|cameron_1: choose a game i guess, a little strange because most use that to claim "ownership" and show a good hand|pg||
nt|mamos: what strength was 2@h   do we know - forcing ?|pg||
nt|mamos: will england bid on ?|pg||
nt|andreasw:  3nt should not win yes|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: could East X ?|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: can it be 3 card suport?|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: West can go alone to 5@H|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 5@H=11 tricks |pg||
nt|brolucius: England supporters can hope so.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|peachy: he ruffed H with the Q, unnecessary|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like another boring hand|pg||
nt|lechcold: dziêki wejciu Brinka nasi dojd¹ do 3BA|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: empting to Dbl with S hand|pg||
nt|peachy: tempting|pg||
nt|andersk: If 5@C makes, then 3 NT makes too|pg||
nt|bagman: If N can ask aces, S can bid quite a lot|pg||
nt|athene: did south think 4nt was asking for the minor?|pg||
nt|fokal: sementa has no idea of the @s void , he might try to protect his K of @s|pg||
nt|fokal: by bidding NT|pg||
nt|bagman: Now 5@S, I guess|pg||
nt|fokal: obvisously S interpreted 4NT as 'what is your minor , partner ? '|pg||
nt|athene: they might scramble into the grand if south finds 5@S now|pg||
nt|hawe45:  What was 2 @S exactly?|pg||
nt|bagman: It's bad to have your misunderstanding on a grand slam deal|pg||
nt|athene: but if there really has been a misunderstanding it's asking a lot to recover and go on to bid a tricky seven|pg||
nt|athene: 2@D showed spades, weak or strong (or some monster balanced)|pg||
nt|athene: so 2@S was obviously a cue - whatever they play that as|pg||
nt|hawe45:  So 5 @S now might do...|pg||
nt|cameron_1: i imagine tom was happy not to have to guess over an immediate 4@s from Brink|pg||
nt|MolvaM: thomas bids what he hopes he can make|pg||
nt|MolvaM: reasonable bid but doesnt work today|pg||
nt|MolvaM: but maybe pushes opps to 4@h|pg||
nt|xenya: 2N promises 20+|pg||
nt|Walddk2: His suit might not be solid :)|pg||
nt|lechcold: i wygraj¹|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 6T aurait eu une chance de gagner si E avait cache ses coeurs, mais evidemment 2C est 100% normale|pg||
nt|marlowepi: a cartes ouvertes c'est faisable meme sans entame coeur, mais le dec fera les deux impasses perdantes|pg||
nt|odysseus69: but maybe some exchanges|pg||
nt|cumino: J@D for a good slam instead of Q@C|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, I expect they will do their duty - taking a look for a slam - and then stop in game.|pg||
nt|bagman: Slam requires the spades to come in and diamond guess|pg||
nt|bagman: I have made worse slams |pg||
nt|babs59: more points, more substance to suits :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|rigas_karo: 4@s in 5-1 fit in the oper room, probably +1|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: looks like an easy 3NT|pg||
nt|boyklas: its difficult to find the Jxx after this bidding, except if he lead it|pg||
nt|ady: should south double if they get to 6@S    might remove to 6NT|pg||
nt|psridhar: difficult to bid 5d on their own last bd- needed push from oppo|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: a part score 2@S by West|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so W missed to find 4/4 hearts fit|pg||
nt|odysseus69: yes - that would be good- but no wasted club cards is what West needs |pg||
mb|p|nt|wygbe1: yep it is|pg||
nt|Walddk12: Good morning to Paul Hackett|pg||
nt|wygbe1: and it was |pg||
nt|ady: problem is not there|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w were merciful but have missed the boat somewhat|pg||
nt|cameron_1: it is usally right to bid on know double fit hands|pg||
nt|tomi2:  but he should not bid 4nt too fast, because it could be keycard for spades, and partner would sell @SAK and no @CA as two aces|pg||
nt|andersk: 4@S is makeable, but <i do not understand why Charlie didnt look for @H suit first|pg||
nt|andersk: need to do something good in @s to make|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: hand 5 other room playing 4@S same contract|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|tomi2:  not hackett should bid 5@H rather than double I think|pg||
nt|ady: sorry    blind spot    2 aces missing|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: can go -1 with a good defence timming|pg||
nt|odysseus69: heavy 2D bid for English style|pg||
pc|c5|nt|rigas_karo: well this is an easy way :)|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Morning everyone|pg||
nt|peachy: Good morning Paul|pg||
nt|wygbe1: morning|pg||
nt|yuval10: very interesting sequence to work with your partner|pg||
nt|bagman: When a misunderstaning occurs, it's difficult to recover, because neither player knows what the misunderstanding has been|pg||
nt|athene: even if both players suspect, neither one can be sure his partner is in on the secret|pg||
nt|bagman: If N thinks that S has 1 ace and @S-void, he still cannot bid the grand|pg||
nt|athene: these sort of auctions are where top pairs really have to put in the time away from the table|pg||
nt|athene: because there are lots of imps riding on these hands|pg||
nt|lechcold: ogranicznie nie znoszê takich wejæ:)...|pg||

pc|cK|nt|paulhac:  It is a playable game just but not with the trump break they did well to only go 1 off in the othere room|pg||
nt|lmeili: after 1@c 1@d what is 1N shows? some player holds 7 HCP as E they may not inv to game|pg||

nt|h_karluk: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_total_tricks|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer is happy to see this dummy; quite sure make and quite a bad slam|pg||
nt|cumino: But EST is 12-14 bal, there isn't many cards for slam|pg||

nt|eweber: just heard the second match of the Dutch was 11-19 vs Spain|pg||
nt|aldek: 4@S was close as well|pg||
nt|tomi2:  with 5@H he committses himself to 6 level even if partners @C were QJT, or does 4@S also show @C control?|pg||
nt|udo: hard now|pg||
pc|cT|nt|motu: depends on vul|pg||

nt|yuval10: now only 2 down....can't be good for the leaders|pg||
nt|xenya: 12 tricks |pg||
nt|ftpe: yes|pg||
nt|ftpe: south should play club|pg||
nt|brolucius: Versace may think: 'I must have club ace to suggest a grand slam (with another spade cue-bid), so this is more accurate, showing @SK too.|pg||

nt|andersk: Do you good people understand the 5@C raise?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: if we are talking abt std signals|pg||
nt|andersk: I would probably try 3 NT|pg||
nt|h_karluk: by N?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: yes lots of game plus - but slam minus  hands|pg||

nt|eweber: England leading the group with 50(!)|pg||
nt|eweber: Russia 13th with 27|pg||
nt|eweber: NL 17th of 19 with 17|pg||
nt|othered1: But first south recues @S, guaranteeing some kind of @C control, I'd think|pg||
nt|udo: 5@S is ?|pg||
nt|brolucius: He would just bid 6@D with second-round club control.|pg||
nt|tomi2:  5@S = both black aces|pg||
nt|udo: i am told @S king and first round club|pg||
nt|brolucius: Well, he has already shown @SA, hasn't he? (With 4@S).|pg||
nt|tomi2:  probably with no @SK he'd bid 6@C|pg||
nt|brolucius: Indeed.|pg||
nt|udo: and 6@D with second round @C controll?|pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: Teraz to zmusili Go do zrobienia nadróbki...|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mamos: England have done well on this board I feel|pg||
nt|othered1: And Lauria selects the highest scoring (and unbreakable, if partner has 1@D) spot.|pg||
pc|d5|nt|haans: Bulgaria do not play Blue Clubs but Precision|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: dangerous but works here |pg||
nt|psridhar: true 3h makes -but two eight card fits deterred the pairs from venturing into 3 level -THE LAW :)|pg||
nt|tomi2:  problem is again, waht does he bid with no club control? 5nt is nonforcing?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|boyklas: 4C at te open room? not 4S?|pg||
nt|lmeili: tx, that means they'll reach 4@h any how|pg||
nt|andersk: Need AQxxxxx and almost nothing more for it to be makeable|pg||
nt|roswolf: israel avoided the slam on bd 3 in the other room and so gained 11|pg||
nt|star6ija: yes|pg||
nt|star6ija: no trump is 14-16...and some new gadgets over 1@c openning|pg||
nt|brolucius: But it was West who had the chance to make a try. East was merely following the route to describe 12-14 with three spades.|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|mcarroll: In a word - No - I do not understand it|pg||
nt|andersk: 3 NT is my choise|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hard to reach there|pg||
nt|andersk: hard to reach 3 NT?|pg||
nt|andersk: Just pull it out of your bidding box:)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: can you make a sample bidding?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: LOL|pg||
nt|h_karluk: it should be played by N|pg||
nt|aldek: could not do better|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hellom Peter|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mamos: surely not|pg||
nt|mamos: not @hK|pg||
nt|xenya: but declarer can either get @Ds righ or squeeze N in the reds |pg||
nt|rodvenn: that is not the law as I understand it|pg||
nt|bagman: WIth no transportation possible between the defenders, declarer took the sure way to make his game|pg||
pc|d9|nt|jkmjanusz: 5@C w 5 tylko bez jednej. 16 IMP|pg||
pc|d4|nt|rnmalik: 9 tricks.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: welcome again.|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|rigas_karo: West bid 4@s over 2@h|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: but maybe he bid 4@c to indicate @c +@s and east (reasonably) passed with singleton @s|pg||
nt|collins64: no Filippos opened 2@h with his 6-card J|pg||
nt|andersk: I understan that 3 @S is a tempting bid|pg||
nt|star6ija: this sequence showed 4-4-4-1 singleton not defined, 2N was relay and 3@c showed @d singleton - 4@h denies control outside|pg||
nt|aldek: the operator is in trouble, it seems|pg||
nt|mamos: vugraph op???????   you there?|pg||
nt|xenya: for the same result|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: 3NT might have made iF south led a high heart .... but 4@C is going 4 off|pg||
pc|s4|nt|collins64: and West bid 4@c with his 55 passed by East|pg||
nt|boyklas: ok, 10 imps for greece|pg||
nt|cameron_1: seems right result|pg||
pc|d8|nt|rodvenn: two 8-card fits make you compete to the 3-level according to the law|pg||
nt|odysseus69: the only question now is how long it will take for 10 tricks|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|andersk: understand|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|peachy: good line to keep it down 1q|pg||
nt|haans: will lose 2 clubs|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: jakby bylo bez dwóch o dziwo przyby³by impik|pg||

pc|s7|nt|wygbe1: looks like that is the line adopted|pg||
nt|peachy: without the Dbl, it is not as obvious|pg||
nt|andersk: I type too fast:)|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: to take opps out of the 8 card fit |pg||
nt|haans: 8 carder outside of the law|pg||
nt|h_karluk: thanks to Marty and Larry, sorry for wrong remembered that devised by Mike|pg||
nt|bagman: A heart ruff and two diamond losers were declarer's worries|pg||
nt|brolucius: Now a possible squeeze if North has the two minor-suit kings.|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|d6|nt|lesh: wrong guess which leads to -1|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sT|pc|h3|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: chance for West|pg||
nt|rodvenn: 8 carder is at the core of the law. This is where it starts|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: guessing @C is home |pg||
nt|psridhar: the law says there are as many tricks as there are trumps|pg||
nt|haans: hard to belie he get this chance|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: a good think & decision wil he put the Q@C or not ?|pg||
nt|babs59: similarly board 4 in the OR, 3NT by East (a more 'normal' contract) is taking a long time|pg||
nt|babs59: not prepared to give away overtrick IMPs if avoidable|pg||
nt|odysseus69: safe to play heart finesse|pg||
nt|babs59: I'm told that Poland bid and made 6NT on board 4|pg||
nt|odysseus69: he is thinking of going for 11 with heart jack but cant risk it|pg||
pc|h4|nt|haans: King but be on other side|pg||
nt|psridhar: so if there are two 8 cad fits there are 16 tricks in total|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: he did |pg||
pc|h2|pc|hK|nt|h_karluk: -3 as i expected|pg||
nt|haans: or not :)|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 2@S = 110 |pg||
nt|psridhar: if your side can 9 of those then they can get only 7 -meaning u go + defending 2 level|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|odysseus69: delay puzzling|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ziff:  He could not afford a 2nd trump early, as he lacks a fast entry to hand for the 2nd @C ruff|pg||
nt|motu: hmm i think now it is posible to score the @H9|pg||
nt|lmeili: yes|pg||
nt|ziff:  So he probably had to lead a @D after that first trump, to open up communication|pg||
nt|motu: it was needed to ruff the @C low and than play a @S|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hJ|nt|wygbe1: this will also work, playing h nine to force a cover, then ruff club back to hand and play spade toward the last 2 trumps in dummy|pg||

nt|athene: what they need is some way for north to agree hearts|pg||

nt|bagman: I'm sure they'll go back to the drawing board after this match|pg||

nt|cameron_1: flat borad|pg||

nt|ftpe: ew migth go to 4 he here|pg||
nt|h_karluk: in practice very hard to reach, given layout diamonds favorably placed|pg||

nt|jameslee 2: Spain had some yeterday againtx portugal at football :)|pg||

mb|2C|nt|h_karluk: unless Sweden gifts some seems Austria's this team couldn't scratch something useful|pg||

nt|yuval10: so "only" 5 imps to Austria|pg||
nt|mamos: i think youd want to be in game|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 5c has much chances if declare can manage the 4-0 split|pg||
nt|tomi2:  7@D could be in danger of some ruff, not likely, but why take the risc...|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: 4H rolls now,, on lucky spade sit|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Although the K@S is right the K@D is wrong so 4@H is an excellent contract|pg||
nt|peachy: EW have a paying sacrifice, rare at Vul|pg||
nt|andersk: Might be possible to bid game here|pg||
nt|bagman: If North was confident that 4NT was RKCB in hearts, that was a good bid; no need to re-cue with 3@S|pg||
nt|fokal: but maybe S could (should ?) have bid something else than 6@h|pg||
nt|haans: the law is not the law just suggestions :)|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: another part score hand |pg||
nt|udo: guess after 3 NT Lauria gave him club A or King|pg||
nt|brolucius: If North has a club more and a diamond fewer, he would be delighted to hear of the @SK, which would give a second club discard.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: not guilty Maam :) i was living in an ocean away and the internet was not invented. i was just thirsty and eager to buy any foreign bridge book, thanks |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 2NT no move after |pg||

nt|jameslee 2: think he will claim |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: straigh away|pg||

nt|paulhac:  Without a heart ruff|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 4 cards M 4th seat|pg||

nt|h_karluk: quite gross dissortion|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT   for n/s looks normal|pg||
nt|athene: well, it was only good if he was confident and he knew his partner was confident it was, too :)|pg||
nt|athene: that is one strange double of 1@C|pg||
nt|bagman: In confusion, it's often a good idea to bid something, which can be passed )|pg||

nt|mdgraham: 1@H looks like a control response, but I can't read the print|pg||

nt|MolvaM: no 7600 distribution so far :)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  sry was away for a bid there:)|pg||
nt|ftpe: well ew had play for 4 hearts, but ns bougth contract in 2 cl on 4-3 fit|pg||
nt|barnets: 5@D passed out big swing for england|pg||
pc|s2|nt|eweber: Imp scoring doesn't seem to work, 5 Imps for Russia until Board 4, if I count correctly|pg||
nt|h_karluk: quickly jettison loser|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: good lord even adding T + 9 I cant see how N is worth 3 bids|pg||
nt|brolucius: A clever method, showing spades but not going past the safety level of 2@H.|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|motu: 4@C would be aceasking for @S|pg||
nt|tomi2:  but is @S suit possible after not raising?|pg||
nt|lmeili: 4th step shows how many key cards?|pg||
nt|tomi2:  2+@Dq|pg||
nt|motu: 2+ trump Q|pg||
nt|lmeili: tx|pg||
nt|h_karluk: to spades|pg||
nt|h_karluk: overtakes K and enjoys|pg||
nt|roswolf: with the diamonds 3-2 no problem|pg||
nt|udo: must be|pg||
nt|udo: 11 tricks,, next:)|pg||
nt|brolucius: 1@H must have been a transfer but I cannot see anything about it on the conv-card that I have up.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: mais aux yeux fermes|pg||
nt|barnets: so very fast start for england here|pg||
nt|odysseus69: this is going well for England but more significantly for Israel|pg||
pc|cA|nt|paulhac:  Best lead but he could have led anything|pg||
nt|MolvaM: u didnt miss much andreas|pg||
nt|andreasw:  great:)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: declarer tries to protect himself against the 2 diamond honors being offside|pg||
nt|MolvaM: so he just gave up a heart trick that he could establish by taking his @hA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes it is, X would have shown hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They play transfers after interference|pg||
nt|udo: last time i played them ( San Remo),, they played transfers|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think a tad stretched 2@s works better than X there|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: na drugim stole to samo - arcymistrzowski overbid|pg||
nt|petergill: Fiona not missing out on the extra 100, plus a heart lead (sdummy's first bid "suit might ensue from her Dbl|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Dhondy used Leaping Michaels (4@D) over the 3@C opener. Wrong time - 500|pg||
nt|petergill: which would be great if South had another heart|pg||
pc|c3|nt|MolvaM: the computer dealt hands makes everyone paranoid a little bit after a while|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: good starting duck by S in  trick 1 |pg||
nt|aldek: moze mu sie juz wszystko pokrecilo|pg||
nt|hawe45:  OK|pg||
pc|c2|nt|kdr_fm: whats extrodinary is that 3NT is going to be real hard to beat|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|bagman: AK and a low heart?|pg||
nt|lechcold: tym rozdaniem obie pary NS nie bêd¹ mog³y siê specjalnie szczyciæ|pg||
nt|snetram:  oby siÄ para B-N nie zagotowaÅa. MajÄ dwa zÅe rozdania|pg||
nt|james_h: not on this lead|pg||
nt|brolucius: All commentators are impartial, of course, but that only refers to their utterances on the screen. Some of them are cheering loudly at each swing in the right direction.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|motu: everything is possible here:)|pg||
nt|athene: just the five obvious tricks to lose here|pg||
nt|petergill: Susan as expected leads a heart - dummy's first bid "suit", after the Dbl|pg||
nt|odysseus69: best to cash 2nd club -then d|pg||
pc|c5|nt|eweber: no miracle in the 4@h contract, but an imp for Russia anyway|pg||
nt|tomi2:  so 1 kexcard is missing and they stop in (a bad) game - I am no fan of this auction...|pg||
nt|chick: or a simple 2@H overcall|pg||
nt|justin c: hi james|pg||
pc|c8|nt|lmeili: at least it makes even guess wrong @s|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|h_karluk: just needs to play a trump|pg||
nt|h_karluk: say East played Ace and switched back to @c|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ruff with K|pg||
nt|athene: red ace-kings and a diamond ruff|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: no entrys in West to develope the @D |pg||
nt|h_karluk: well aren't we ready to play at least 3 level in any suit ? |pg||
nt|chick: EW potentially had 3N, so a disaster for NS is not a given|pg||
nt|lesh: a possible 800, South has to be careful|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: tam król kier sie utrzyma³|pg||
nt|aldek: problem jest nastepujacy, jak pas jest forsujacy to czy zaprasza do 5-ciu czy do 6-ciu|pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: E - nie nmajak wypucic...|pg||
nt|8252: EO vont mener 4 0 mais ça va s'arreter là|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: ya east has too many entries|pg||
nt|bagman: The defense can take 2 clubs, a diamond and two trumps + a trick|pg||
nt|bagman: the trick can be either 3rd trump wiht a diamond overruff or a heart|pg||
nt|odysseus69: and now 3rd club|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|collins64: about the previous deal, you always have to discuss before is it or not GF 4@c overcall after weak 2@h opening|pg||
nt|MolvaM: now he can do his throw in|pg||
nt|jkotor: to mówi: "nie wiem czy ich X, czy graæ wy¿ej"|pg||
nt|jkotor: tak przynajmniej ja rozumiem pasa forsuj¹cego|pg||
pc|c6|nt|h_karluk: @h A  favorably placed|pg||
nt|MolvaM: which he didnt need actually :)|pg||
nt|james_h: hi boyz|pg||
nt|petergill: Fiona will (eventually, there's no rush) cash out|pg||
pc|d3|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|athene: no chance for the defence to get a trump promotion going and i don't see why declarer should take a backwards trump finesse|pg||
nt|xenya: S showed 5-4 in the minors, but clubs could longer than diamonds, so N had to guess -- hence his pass over 2@C|pg||
pc|c9|nt|collins64: West had a very nice hand with 19HCP and East Pass with 2 Kings and a 7-card Q10 suit|pg||
nt|rnmalik: oops|pg||
nt|haans: we all see the clubs finesse|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Italy gained 10 when Russia played silly 4C contract here and 3NT next door|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h3|nt|andersk: wrong slam|pg||
nt|andersk: normal line|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 10 @C could come in play |pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|collins64: x Kxx Q10xxxxx KJ|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: if 4@c is not GF easts is reasonable however, he thinks the hand is a misfit, and his K@h can be a wasted value|pg||
nt|andersk: a lucky make|pg||
nt|andersk: since @H K is together with 3 card @S|pg||
nt|rnmalik: no on a @H finesse can make 7. @D lead would force him to take a finesse.|pg||
nt|andersk: I must be sleeping, 6 is alw cold|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: Sorry for the rush for the previous deql now we are align with the players|pg||
nt|rnmalik: ok and thanks.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but still may go down|pg||
nt|davidb: board  6  was classical  SPL   -suit preference lead -  high H for D |pg||
nt|ady: ooops     Patchman trying to protect possible entry and clear the hearts|pg||
nt|andreasw:  ok 9 trick's |pg||
nt|mdgraham: pity about the club ruff|pg||
nt|mdgraham: bit of a gift, that|pg||
pc|h6|nt|motu: i do not see why E went beyond 3N since 2N shoed allready extras|pg||
nt|ziff:  Not easy to bid, as W may have 5 @D and @SA instead of KJ, making slam pretty good|pg||
nt|bagman: No trump promotion but the old fashioned tap|pg||
nt|bagman: Now a heart and ruff with 9 ?|pg||
nt|haans: best not is spades|pg||
nt|aldek: who should bid 4, east or west?|pg||
nt|rodvenn: not vulnerable you should, according to the law, always compete to the 3-level holding 8 against 8. They make, you go one down in the typical example|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Ivan needs subway tickets to enter the table and that doesn't help much|pg||
nt|petergill: the club ruffs were hard to find - EW will be happy with plus 200|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ziff:  Hope springs eternal, as they say, but I agree that it was agressive|pg||
nt|athene: he is more likely to ruff with the queen surely|pg||
nt|MolvaM: but its good for discussions after the match with yr teammates: "I could have made it even if both @d honors were off"|pg||
nt|haans: Body in clubs very good|pg||
nt|rodvenn: of course you may feel that your hand has intermideate cards in their suit which makes you take another course|pg||
nt|petergill: @SA then @HA is what I would do|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But is X only for a @h lead? not in my opinion, so a @c lead is not so far away. But in nt - yes|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|eweber: I don't count correcly, 4:1 is correct|pg||
nt|h_karluk: now trump promo possible|pg||
nt|bagman: what would you do then?|pg||
nt|cameron_1: i think they play the method 3m=non max lin linked M and 3M=max in other M|pg||
nt|mamos: I dont think West can    |pg||
nt|haans: endplay in hearts|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|rnmalik: No @H finesse 6.|pg||
nt|andersk: East will get a trumph raise|pg||
nt|ftpe: will be poor result for ns i think|pg||
pc|dK|nt|andersk: unfortunate for the sweeds|pg||
nt|h_karluk: the declarer should play a trump to K before touching @h|pg||
nt|cameron_1: so it was up to tom|pg||
nt|udo: hm,,,,was this the best line?|pg||
pc|d6|nt|rnmalik: tricky hand after very good lead of @D. we have seen all cards so easy for us.:)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3@S in E is key to its making without finesse also which is % wise low.|pg||
nt|andersk: Austrians|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ruff and do that - now or never|pg||
nt|haans: and a make???|pg||
nt|h_karluk: not really|pg||
nt|h_karluk: if pitches and plays a trump to table goes down to @c shift|pg||
nt|h_karluk: if ruffs and plays a trump to hand always makes, thinner than a hair line|pg||
nt|haans: best play was not to cover|pg||
nt|Walddk12: Good morning to Peter Crouch|pg||
nt|xenya: quite poor, yes|pg||
nt|xenya: 2@D is certainly better, although i'm not sure it makes |pg||
nt|lesh: 500 now, against 4@h it is a good result|pg||
nt|marlowepi: un spec astucieux note que 6P est faisable sur la donne precedente|pg||
nt|james_h: Terry is watchin the pips|pg||
pc|d2|nt|motu: with a decent hand and 5-5 W will make move over 3nt|pg||
nt|h_karluk: as we see all cards easy, i doubt same for him/her|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|andreasw:  :) *i could*|pg||
nt|lesh: here is nothing East can do to prevent South from taking 3more spade tricks|pg||
nt|odysseus69: sorry Lauria was declarer - also fine player|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dJ|nt|ziff:  If 2N showed extras, yes|pg||
nt|mamos: same auction exactly in OR|pg||
nt|haans: well done|pg||
nt|james_h: hence taking the @sA|pg||
nt|james_h: Terry (W)|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: S will hope the @CA is with west now|pg||
nt|james_h: I dont think he has great expectations|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: well AQ9xx and ace is enough to double 2@d ... but he'll be disappointed|pg||
pc|dA|nt|xenya: best he could do was play the @SQ|pg||
nt|bagman: Now declarer is quite badly placed. He'll probably ruffs a heart high|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that's off one|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: he is full off 10/9 cards fos Nt contract lovely deal |pg||
pc|d7|nt|h_karluk: fifty fifty, 3 tricks for EW also|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ftpe: well|pg||
nt|ftpe: ew migthy bid 4 he|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|andersk: had to start with a small @D from dummy, to avoid truph promotion|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|haans: kick them when they are down|pg||
nt|james_h: I dont think She has great expectstions (thanks kib)|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|xenya: 3 off now|pg||
pc|s5|nt|bagman: Bocchi's trump big enough to score|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 2 down- maybe get Italy on scoreboard|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer makes the two high trumps from dummy for -2|pg||
nt|barnets: tthey will get on board 5 -200 in 1n|pg||
pc|s7|nt|eweber: and of course the Imp in 4@h was for NL|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Heart thumping:)|pg||

nt|collins64: if it is NF|pg||
nt|paulhac:  England takes the lead for the first time.|pg||
nt|andersk: unlucky board for the Austrians|pg||
nt|h_karluk: west still should refuse to overruff for a late trump promo possibility|pg||
nt|yuval10: and she did|pg||
nt|roswolf: overtrick imps to ireland|pg||

nt|MolvaM: 3@c shows what?|pg||
nt|shevek: no, not from here !|pg||
nt|MolvaM: both minors?|pg||
nt|shevek: 3@c = 5-5 in the minors|pg||
nt|andreasw:  it should|pg||
nt|hawe45:  E/O ou N/S?|pg||
mb|p|nt|collins64: another 2@c opening in North|pg||
nt|athene: will south double 2@H or bid 2@S?|pg||
mb|2D|nt|andersk: Italy running good in Bridge, but currently out of the world cup|pg||
nt|star6ija: 3N is possible here|pg||
nt|aldek: I'd say west should bid on the base of the quality of the spades, an ace and a singleton|pg||
nt|cameron_1: i agree|pg||
nt|andreasw:  i will go a few times and be back after 10 second's have to see score's from danaish match:)|pg||

mb|p|nt|collins64: both majors at least 44|pg||
nt|boyklas: i think he judged that the hand shouldnt be to game with the singleton S and the KH wasted value after showing C+S|pg||
nt|bagman: If partner has Txx left, both the 9 and the Q work; what about other holdings?|pg||
nt|ftpe: boring cards again|pg||
nt|justin c: expect south will drive to slam now|pg||

nt|brolucius: The players in the Open Room are not exactly burning the baize with their playing speed, They are three boards behind already.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 7 boards and 24 IMPs exchanged, interesting|pg||
nt|aldek: przeczytaj moje pytanie, prosze|pg||
nt|petergill: EW Convention Card http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/May/WomensTeams/england/stockdale-brown.pdf|pg||
nt|bagman: NS can make 4@H here, the 11th trick can come from the spade lead or spade guess|pg||
nt|brolucius: Gold found an 11-count that he was willing to pass. (Only a jack in the long suit, and four jacks in all.)|pg||
nt|bagman: Now he needs to describe the 'impossible' hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|jameslee 2: East a take out 2@D on a dangerous 1Nt X|pg||
nt|lesh: probably E will bid 2@s or 2@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulhac:  IF East had been the overcaller one could say that Spain were unlucky|pg||
nt|h_karluk: well, sorry i disagree that was unlucky|pg||

nt|andreasw:  3@h slam invit?|pg||
nt|shevek: looks like it|pg||
nt|andreasw:  no best slam with @d AK out:)|pg||
nt|shevek: but 5@d is not a make|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 5d seems ok since defence cannot take their club ruff with a small trump|pg||
nt|rodvenn: Very good bridge to reach 5 @d in both rooms. |pg||
nt|james_h: 2@d XX being played at the other table|pg||
nt|james_h: NS|pg||
nt|eamongall: The Great Mulall managed 2@DXX a few months ago in the Regent up 3 ... Michael is not having the same success |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: another missfit in @S for N-S|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: shooting to 3NT |pg||
nt|brolucius: He may bid 3@S to show a sound raise to 4@H. No, 2NT does the job.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 2NT is a heart raise|pg||
nt|odysseus69: cant imagine them missing game|pg||
nt|bagman: Townsend has enought to bid/force to game|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: or the score is wrong -- that happens from time to time|pg||
nt|lesh: but over 2@h West might blast to a game|pg||
nt|oleberg: The natural @D lead, will give the 9.th trick immidiately|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 3NT with a missfit is alays veryvery dificult |pg||
nt|oleberg: The natural heart lead is better :)|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 1 of the thing we try to teach bridge students is to go to game to 3NT with a fit in a minor |pg||
nt|mdgraham: and mine|pg||
pc|h5|nt|chick: don't think a major suit game is possible|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: Buras wita sie z g¹sk¹ - poszli mu w kiera...|pg||
nt|hawe45:  OK - cÂ´est possible|pg||
nt|petergill: EW at the other table won the World Junior (U26) Pairs Championship in 2006 in Piestany, Slovakia, the only female pair ever to do so|pg||
nt|petergill: Cecilia Rimstedt was only 18 at the time, I think|pg||
pc|h2|nt|peachy: 2NT might have been alerted, otherwise I don't understand it|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 5@d good|pg||
nt|shevek: actually might make|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: second X pass out |pg||
nt|psridhar: this can be set 800|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: quite  a few down -3/-4 could be the result|pg||
nt|brolucius: If Madala had passed, some use 2NT by North to show a sound four-card heart raise and 2@S to show a sound three-card raise.|pg||
pc|h9|nt|wygbe1: probably lebensohl|pg||
nt|santyclz: The 6@h+1 ended as a push.  Neither n/s was able to overcome the preempt.|pg||
nt|star6ija: happens... :)|pg||
nt|shevek: yes|pg||
nt|haans: easier to play 2@D doubles not game sore if make|pg||
nt|psridhar: if defense can find the club ruff-they will get plenty of opportunities for the ruff|pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: Tam wyszli po raz drugi w Kiera. Alew chyba nie dadza rady wypuciæ|pg||
nt|8252: on devrait abdiquer, les @s ont souvent raison|pg||

nt|jameslee 2: @S brake nicely |pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|lesh: well looks like over 2@s as well :)|pg||
nt|chick: perhaps with a club finesse to dump a heart, this could make|pg||
nt|snetram:  3 kier forsowaÅo do koÅcÃ³wki, wiÄc pas zaprasza do szlemika|pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: Gdyby @CAs by³ u W, by³by przymus...|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ftpe: he will try ruff 2 di at hand|pg||
nt|lesh: the defence has to be careful|pg||
nt|babs59: Russia are in 6th place on 180 with France close behind on 178.  After that there's a bigger gap, Netherlands on 164...|pg||
pc|h6|nt|eweber: in board 4 NL managed to win 4 by making 2@d, so 5:4 for them now|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Lebensohl or transfer Lebensohl. Transfer Lebensohl would show both monors|pg||
nt|peachy: even down 1, this be small gain for England|pg||
nt|peachy: and it could slip home|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Which is Jason and which is Justin?|pg||

nt|ady: 2 minor suit aces to lose|pg||
nt|shevek: can't score a ruff on top of AK|pg||
nt|lesh: he didnt has the entry ,however the small spade gave it|pg||
nt|h_karluk: then ruff hearts and try devil's coup|pg||
nt|petergill: At least 8 tricks for NS, even on a trump switch|pg||
nt|oleberg: Like Zia says: When you have the @D9, PLAY IT|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|athene: the auction in the other room looks like an interesting twist on leaping michaels - you bid 4 of the minor you haven't got|pg||
nt|athene: that is perhaps sensible if you play the bids as forcing|pg||
nt|bagman: Thx all. I need to go now, see you again.|pg||
nt|bagman: bye|pg||

nt|jameslee 2: 9@D   a not bad play he will make 9 tricks |pg||
nt|oleberg: Yes, the defence has to play something|pg||
nt|odysseus69: hoping that defence will get stuck into diamonds or even spades|pg||
nt|babs59: has it changed?|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|athene: it looks at first as though declarer might be able to hold his losers to two trumps from here, if he guesses right, but there's just too much work to do, i suppose|pg||
nt|lesh: well the declarer didnt want to take advantage|pg||
nt|chick: hehe|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Versace will not fall for this|pg||
pc|dT|nt|star6ija: 12 tricks may be taken now|pg||
nt|haans: @S7 count even|pg||
nt|bagman: This solves the spade guess as the the @DJ can be used to discard the spade|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|paulhac:  This looks like the only lead to give the contract|pg||

nt|justin c: only needs the @SK or the @DK right|pg||

pc|cK|nt|ziff:  We can see that the contract is cold, but declarer can see only 8 tricks|pg||
nt|athene: ok, this is just doing his work for him|pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: Graja 3 Dzwonki|pg||
nt|bagman: Anyhow, the non-spade lead indicates the @SA|pg||
pc|c2|nt|brolucius: Good point.|pg||
nt|bagman: With trumps breaking the declarer has an easy claim|pg||
pc|c3|nt|rigas_karo: nothing else here i think, @s to the K and claim|pg||

nt|xenya: 9 tricks now on a cross ruff|pg||
nt|chick: so a grosvenor duck by N sets this :)|pg||
nt|petergill: My job was to photograph the Swedish girls for the Bulletin after their win in Piestany. Cecilia said "Please wait until I make myself look better." I thought that was impossible. ...|pg||
nt|petergill: I will see if I can show find the photo for you|pg||
nt|odysseus69: no - defence still ok as long as not club|pg||
pc|s6|nt|athene: spade force looked the natural play - perhaps Duboin was worried about forcing declarer too much and helping him into a trump coup against north's known heart length|pg||
nt|haans: Fallenius do not like it :(|pg||
nt|psridhar: Fredin must be ruing his decision to upgrade his hand to 1NT opening|pg||

nt|ziff:  I am not surprised....|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: I see that on the rama but no idea on the subject|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: maybe on the slow playing|pg||
nt|tomi2:  yeaterday Nerherlands - Russia was scored as 18-2 VP because of 5 VP for each team|pg||
nt|lmeili: because of slow play?|pg||
nt|tomi2:  yes, as far as I know|pg||
nt|lmeili: that was a heavy penalty!|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: If I have good information they finish 20 minutes late in that match|pg||
nt|tomi2:  10 VP for 20 minutes? thats a lot|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: restarting here|pg||
nt|athene: which means duboin can't have had a count on the diamonds - if he knew declarer had four he would have bashed out that @S10 like a shot|pg||
nt|athene: the standard counter to a 2-suiter being to force declarer|pg||
nt|andreasw:  then a @d to ace and a @s back |pg||

nt|psridhar: might hv worked on some other layout |pg||

nt|h_karluk: 5@c/@d ok|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: the @D was abit of desperation ... if left to her (i'm told) own devices declarer will have to gess is it @dKxx or @dKx|pg||
nt|cumino: May be board 6 is a bit delicate if EST opens 1S|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: israel made 3nt on bd 4 for another game swing|pg||
nt|ady: partial here in spades   Ireland need to keep low|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes may well get too high|pg||
nt|psridhar: Fredin will briefly consider 3nt b4 bidding 4s when he finds out his pd has unbal hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: There was no follow-up to discuss. North jumped to 3@D, South thought it was a WJS and passed|pg||
nt|cumino: 1NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: apparently the rooms are connected now|pg||
nt|Gerben42: white vs red NS are very agressive, but as we have seen vuln. they are middle of the road|pg||

nt|Gerben42: best to not dream but pass with a happy face|pg||
nt|eweber: I assume West is the one who is taking his time here|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Great to see the Irish at the top of the leader board|pg||
nt|josj: as far as I know, they were about 30 mins. late and were eventually fined 3 VP each|pg||

nt|ftpe: that opening will probably bring them to 6 spades|pg||
nt|xenya: on 7, the Estonian EW in the other room got to 4@H -- not a bad contract really, but down on foul trump split -- 1 down and 7 imps to Russia|pg||
nt|ftpe: in 6 spades he has to guess spade queen, but best chance is playing on sp 2-2|pg||

mb|1N|nt|boyklas: FG raise with D?|pg||
nt|boyklas: or 14+ Bal?|pg||
nt|haans: that 1@S overcall???|pg||
nt|xenya: i don't think 6@S is such a great contract -- problems in spades and diamonds|pg||
nt|ftpe: agree, but they will get there after ligth open, |pg||
nt|xenya: well the 3@H bid makes it easier to solve the spade problem|pg||

mb|p|nt|rigas_karo: it is safe to bid once again but |pg||
nt|rnmalik: very tempting:)|pg||
nt|mamos: good pressure from South|pg||
nt|othered1: Bye, Udo.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i choose 3@h cue here|pg||
nt|chick: right, 3@C is a better bid|pg||
nt|lechcold: basketball|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: ahh true|pg||
mb|p|nt|collins64: if Mike bid 4@d, Isabelle 4@h they'll play 6@d|pg||
nt|eweber: if anyone of the players|pg||
nt|yuval10: not everyone's X perhaps|pg||
nt|ady: this might cause Irland to get too high|pg||
nt|jkotor: jak w dobrych juniorskich czasach :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|rigas_karo: 4@d or 4NT?|pg||
nt|roswolf: the boards have been swingy - Italy - slovakia 46-0 after 4 boards shows how|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Vul, not for the fainthearted!|pg||
nt|mamos: at least a couple off|pg||
nt|cameron_1: but flat vs. 3@s so|pg||
nt|cameron_1: flatish|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes but N takes the firsst @D trick|pg||
nt|MolvaM: good stop|pg||
nt|andreasw:  first|pg||
nt|xenya: no slam now -- just collecting your money i think...|pg||
nt|lechcold: 2BA naci¹gane|pg||
nt|james_h: Penos in South Africa ...|pg||
nt|oleberg: 2@H = 3 spades and a good raise. Normally not a gameforcing hand|pg||
pc|h3|nt|andersk: opps|pg||
nt|andersk: cold 4 @H|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 4@H +1|pg||
nt|athene: not sure i like unusual 2nt with 6@D4@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: :)|pg||
nt|athene: partner usually bids clubs with equal length which isn't at all what you want|pg||
nt|athene: notice how south can't bid stayman intending 2@S (sign-off) over 2@D|pg||
nt|athene: they obviously play that as something cunning|pg||
nt|athene: we have seen they have lots of relay auctions after stayman so you do lose the ability to bid it on rubbish hands|pg||
nt|shevek: 8 declarer made 3N and 8 went down|pg||
nt|shevek: declarers|pg||
nt|MolvaM: so it must have been a 50% contract :)|pg||
nt|shevek: true, needs accurate defence|pg||
nt|shevek: lol  murat|pg||
nt|xenya: or... who knows?|pg||
nt|lesh: he has to guess Q@d now, but it is difficult and probably -2|pg||
nt|hawe45:  300 avec le bon flanc - mais tout normale|pg||
nt|mdgraham: understandable auction, but the cards do not lie well|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: Ole I would love to play Ghana tat would mean we are in the final :)|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 2@H = is new for me nice |pg||
nt|oleberg: "To play Ghana" sounds like something that could be illegal (or prohibited to minors)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: coffee time|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A very sound contract on this lie|pg||
nt|mdgraham: heavy 1NT overcall, but you don't really want to pass at this vulnerability|pg||
pc|h8|nt|pitiful:  some play middle encourages and high or low sp in this situation|pg||
nt|shevek: to be fair some went down in 6@d :)|pg||
nt|petergill: Found it http://www.worldbridge1.org/bulletin/06_2%20Piestany/pdf/pairs/bul_04.pdf there are 2 photos of Cecilia. Interesting that the Poles who ran 2nd to them in the 2006 World ...|pg||
nt|petergill: Junior Pairs are near the top of the datums in the Open here in Ostend|pg||
nt|ralfwil: was N opening 1@h? 5+ |pg||
pc|hA|nt|collins64: he made the wrong choice|pg||
nt|boyklas: all the problems comes here for S because he doesnt know the H or the C Quebid|pg||
nt|boyklas: and he make go down even a 5D|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: at least the did well to avoid 6NT :)|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: 5@d by North is safe|pg||
nt|collins64: Belgium is back after the previous deal|pg||
nt|collins64: Dehaye weak NT forced them to play 4@h for one down|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: very weak NT :)|pg||
nt|boyklas: Manolis choosed to play at the 5-3 fit and not at the 4-4, firstly was thinking that he is playing at th 5-4 fit|pg||
nt|collins64: the bidding was 1NT 8-11 Pass 3@c X and he bid 4@h with his 5-card Q@h and his 4-card 8@s|pg||
nt|ady: they might make this  getting 3 diamond tricks|pg||
nt|lesh: A@s and @d switch|pg||
nt|h_karluk: straightforward play also possible|pg||
nt|chick: against the odds to drop the @DQ, but W may lead trump now to protect against a spade ruff|pg||
nt|barnets: Hacketts stopped in 4@S|pg||
nt|bagman: The hands do not fit well|pg||
nt|barnets: after a couple of slam tries|pg||
nt|barnets: on board 6|pg||
nt|brolucius: Countries in certain parts of the globe get a 'free pass' into the Bermuda Bowl. It is much more difficult if you are a European country.|pg||
nt|barnets: Holland have afree pass|pg||

nt|bagman: Declarer is afraid to duck|pg||
pc|h2|nt|collins64: did he actually play the K@h|pg||
nt|boyklas: i dont think so.|pg||
nt|andersk: probably @H 9 lead|pg||
nt|rnmalik: suit worth bidding is worth leading.:)|pg||
nt|haans: most would say "thats not fair"|pg||
nt|davidb: should make on the  D suit |pg||
nt|athene: if north has a pretty good penalty pass here unless he thinks the double is really really offensive|pg||
nt|santyclz: The "DNPA" (does not promise anything) stayman has a lot going for it, but gives up a lot on big hands.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Entame atout - et bonne chance...|pg||
nt|haans: @H to ace to avoid @S ruff|pg||

nt|chick: OR, E could make a brilliant overtake of the spades and lead a trump :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: if ther declarer decided to play straightforward that doesn't make a sense|pg||

nt|odysseus69: surprising to win|pg||
pc|dK|nt|rnmalik: Possibility only if declarer guesses the entry to W hand.|pg||
nt|athene: Mari shamefacedly trying to shift some diamonds in with his clubs, courtesy of a black pen|pg||
nt|brolucius: Speculative double from East.|pg||
nt|othered1: Their doubles show extras, I believe.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They prefer to use double for something else. One can survive without support doubles you know|pg||
nt|tomi2:  eas has @CAQ in their opened suit, @DA, @SQ and partner made a constructive call vulnerable|pg||
nt|brolucius: Kibitzers suggest lead-directing double (similar to Lightner). But not obvious to me, nor to West.|pg||
nt|lesh: Q@D :)|pg||
nt|james_h: tes they are, confirmed|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Roland like all english men has becomes a master of understatement|pg||

nt|othered1: I survive very well without them in almost all partnerships that don't have hours to discuss their ramifications.|pg||
nt|jkotor: 80 to ju¿ blisko mojego juniorskiego rekordu 88-1 w 8 rozd|pg||
nt|justin c: this looks like a good moment to get a drink|pg||
nt|brolucius: In Beijing there were 13 European quarter-finalists out of 16 (in the Open and Women's events) but Europe is given only one quarter of the world championship slots for the Bermuda ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: Bowl and Venice Cup.|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer can make with high cross ruff, if the defense takes the heart ruff|pg||
nt|barnets: that is why the european championships are one of the toughest tests in the whole of bridge|pg||
nt|bagman: Gold thinking how to beat this. There is, however, no way to beat|pg||
nt|odysseus69: and if they dont?|pg||
nt|cumino: 1 more if they don't|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer can discard a heart on the @CA to make 11 tricks with a cross ruff|pg||
pc|d2|nt|yuval10: nice guess by declarer|pg||

nt|8252: fo pas exagérer, le 8 de @s stoppe l'hemoragie|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 2nd tie break for Murray|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer was quite safe when he did not discard a heart on @CA in the early play, If he would have misguessed diamonds, the 2nd trump back woul d have leaft him a trick short|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|xenya: down 4 if W just cashes his high cards now|pg||

nt|roswolf: yes intra finesse position|pg||
nt|pitiful:  still a nice pick up for n-s|pg||
nt|pitiful:  even without the double|pg||
nt|marlowepi: trois fois trefles, as de pique, carreau et pique, un trefle aussi eventuellement au flanc|pg||
nt|bagman: the only way to discard would have been by crossing with a trump|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d4|pg||
nt|athene: still 800|pg||
nt|ftpe: rigth|pg||
nt|xenya: of course, you could argue that EW might have got in later in the auction, but it's easier to say...|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 10@H or 9@H|pg||
pc|c2|nt|hawe45:  But less than 500 will be difficult|pg||
pc|c7|nt|xenya: by the way, i think the E hand is an opener|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Le retour du 9 de @H Ã¡ la place du Valet aura ete mieux|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mcarroll: Back to +1 after no trump shift|pg||

nt|ryskiel_: coup de grace 9@D|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Be careful Ed, David may have to look that word up too|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer has three minor-suit stoppers to knock out.|pg||
nt|jkotor: czy nie lepiej teraz z pozycji Adama 10?|pg||
pc|d6|nt|rnmalik: In the OR K@D was led.|pg||

nt|ady: only 9 tricks|pg||
nt|davidb: H to K & D to the 9 -normal play|pg||
nt|ady: diamond to the ace and diamond to 9|pg||
nt|bagman: Madala's playing safe for 10 tricks; he should have cashed the @DK as South ruffing it and trump back was practically impossible|pg||
nt|rodvenn: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/runningscores/asp/roundteamsconditstatclassicmod.asp?qtournid=821&qshowflag=1|pg||

nt|jkotor: jednak bilans to potêga|pg||
pc|hT|nt|rnmalik: Good chance now.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|brolucius: Had he drawn the last trump, he would be stuffed now - a heart would force the last trump in the South hand.|pg||

nt|brolucius: Attitude leads against NT, so the low club shows a suit that will be worth pursuing.|pg||
nt|othered1: would south have taken the same line without the double, which pretty strongly put the @CQ offside?.|pg||
nt|lesh: @c switch is not that difficult|pg||
nt|lesh: or playing small :)|pg||
nt|justin c: several of them, truth to tell|pg||

nt|petergill: so 1NT rebid 15-17 and 2@D GF checkback with 2@H = three hearts|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East getting the character of her hand across with 1NT. Not much of a diamond stop, but anything else would be a distortion  |pg||

nt|petergill: North's jamming 4@H call was a good bid, convincing EW not to try 4@S|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed, especially since 4@s would actually make on a heart lead|pg||
nt|petergill: With NS playing a limited opening system (11H 11-16), 4@H might also have been bid on a balanced 14 count, making 4@S by East quite dangerous|pg||

nt|jameslee 2: @H brake 3/3 will help him to get home|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @sA onside and @h not worse than 4-2 is enough|pg||

pc|d2|nt|hawe45:  Carefully played to discard a @H|pg||
nt|cameron_1: are you sure?|pg||
nt|mamos: South holding @HK makes it morelikely that North has @sK   but still needs to finesse 10|pg||
nt|othered1: But NS will  have an exact description of west hand and west will be declarer so @H lead very likely from both sides.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Well done to bid it!|pg||
nt|tomi2:  lauria will lead @HK with his likely trump trick|pg||

nt|pitiful:  and no I do not play for Spurs|pg||
nt|pitiful:  perhaps I need to put that in my profile|pg||
nt|dburn: his problem is that he thinks (from the opening bid) that North has the ace of clubs|pg||
nt|pitiful:  this is very tough for TT|pg||
nt|pitiful:  DG sorry|pg||
nt|dburn: in which case he needs to cater for the possibility that North will play the fourth round of diamonds|pg||
nt|dburn: so perhaps he will cash hearts, hoping to pitch West's remaining diamond|pg||
nt|dburn: of course, if he had played a low heart to the queen instead of running the jack, as he probably should have done, he would have a quick entry to dummy now|pg||
nt|ftpe: yes|pg||

nt|tomi2:  @C lead would be fatal, but I can't imagine this|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so Jivko, just curiosity, you didn't consider 1N overcall by W?|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: Ice|pg||
nt|oleberg: South undeled his diamonds in case declarer had the @SJ|pg||

pc|h3|nt|haans: now he must try spades|pg||

pc|sK|pg||
pc|c8|pc|d4|nt|hawe45:  Claim|pg||
nt|dburn: but he would doubtless have used that to play for North to hold @sKx rather than @sK10x|pg||
nt|lesh: it depends on their methods and the decision of the player. 1NT could be 5@c and 4M, or as here he prefered DBL instead of overcalling 1nt as 15-17|pg||
nt|mdgraham: difference of style on board 7. KQxx xx xx AKQxx. Over 1@D - Lauria bid 2@C, +110. The Russian North doubled, which got them to 2@H, -50. Not that that proves anythng  |pg||

pc|c7|nt|rnmalik: sorry-11.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: There is no sane player who would insert the 10|pg||
nt|othered1: now west has to  hope that north also holds 4+@D to pitch both @H|pg||
nt|tomi2:  he will try for singleton king of clubs with south maybe ?;)|pg||
nt|brolucius: God is Italian in this room. But he will not be Italian in the other room, if they reach the good slam too.|pg||
nt|tomi2:  god was a German yesterday, that is quite fair :)|pg||

nt|shevek: now 6@h is the place to be here|pg||
nt|MolvaM: now thats an exciting hand|pg||
nt|shevek: BUT....|pg||

nt|kdr_fm: oh well commentators curse .. -1|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: how many timz u ll have 0661 w 18|pg||
nt|lesh: 6@c for E/W but difficult to reach, after 1@c opening as 16+|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: the only way to get higher is to be pushed by opps|pg||
nt|andreasw:  poland reach slam here just not 6@h but 6@d:)|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3@H was a good bid but that was not exactly the dummy he was looking for.|pg||
mb|1D|nt|rnmalik: 3NT for Ns.|pg||
nt|tomi2:  in the OR Piekared prefered a double here to 2NT|pg||
nt|tomi2:  ending up as dummy in 2@D, not the contract he was dreaming of|pg||
nt|athene: i am not sure where they went wrong but clearly a wheel came off somewhere|pg||
nt|pitiful:  another lead directing bid|pg||
nt|dburn: I suspect the play went quickly at the end - some of those cards were doubltess not played to the same trick|pg||
nt|shevek: I just had a glimpse at the poles playing in 6@d|pg||
nt|shevek: you too :)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  :)|pg||
nt|lesh: I wonder what 1NT is|pg||
nt|chick: 3 suit takeout?|pg||
nt|lesh: I suppose N/S will land at least at 5th level, but then E/W might bid 6@c and then ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: say didn't begin w art 1@c, 3 aces outside, so that's DD slam of EW players, what a homework, ty teacher!|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 11 cards @S for N-S|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: direct 4@S|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: by S|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: EW possibly in trouble now|pg||
nt|xenya: perhaps W was concerned about bad splits in the balck suits and 4-1 @Hs, but all was well|pg||
nt|8252: mais il vaut mieux soit qua ça marche, soit avoir des partenaires compréhensifs et doux|pg||
mb|2N|nt|andersk: Est overcalled 1 @S in open room, and South 2 @S, quite strange bidding, anyway NOrway playing 5 NT in open room|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Looks like 4@H should make|pg||
nt|tomi2:  Wladow knows about partnes @C qualitiy, so he won't lead a club now ;)|pg||
nt|mamos: Gold keeps his 1@D openers up to strength :)|pg||
nt|funtay: adamlar 1 lovenin bile pesinde |pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 5@C looks difficult with a trump trick and A@S off  and diamonds bottled up|pg||
nt|justin c: did East bid this?|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: unlikely undo ?|pg||
nt|eamongall: I don't think she meant to be rescued |pg||
nt|james_h: this might get interesting but I doubt it|pg||
nt|eamongall: ah yeah pass 1@S |pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 11: At the other table, South opened 1NT, West bid 2@C single suiter  and EW never found out what suit it was, so NS ended up in 4@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|andersk: 2-2|pg||
nt|andersk: no|pg||
nt|andersk: offside|pg||
nt|andersk: incredible match on TV too:)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 6@d may have communication problems.... between parters :)|pg||
nt|lesh: probably 1nt was 3 suits and that's why North decided to pass over 3@d|pg||
nt|lesh: and possible 5@c bid by West now if 1nt is what we suppose to mean|pg||
nt|petergill: something to be said for: calling a spade a spade, perhaps|pg||
nt|ralfwil: close to 6nt|pg||
nt|mdgraham: or even Two Spades|pg||
nt|petergill: yes|pg||
nt|petergill: Susan Stockdale knows that her @DK should be huge, being in partner's suit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: raise to 4NT?|pg||
nt|petergill: I think she will bid 4NT quantitative|pg||
nt|ralfwil: perhaps 4nt from W|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: nice fight by W = 5@C |pg||
nt|oleberg: 5@C is a nice save, -300|pg||
mb|p|nt|lesh: but still it will be very agressive |pg||
nt|funtay: sry|pg||
pc|sT|nt|eweber: but still, with 210 and 170 on my score card I wouldn't feel to good, it may not cost but surely won't bring in...|pg||
nt|andersk: even more exsiteing then bbo|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT hopless if they lead hearts   |pg||
nt|andreasw:  lol|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: dangerous reopenning here |pg||
nt|psridhar: thin 4s for EW , a lucky make -but imposs to get there unless pushed|pg||
nt|haans: but most of us would|pg||
nt|psridhar: South does have a good hand, cant fault him for reopening|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: what will North try to bid ?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think a similar example was in one of Ian Fleming's 007 JB books|pg||
nt|h_karluk: trappy sample|pg||
nt|lesh: I dont think North will pass|pg||
nt|lesh: South has showed 0-5 and 6+ spades but ...|pg||
nt|chick: N's hand is far too good|pg||
nt|chick: almost slam in hand|pg||
nt|lesh: 4@h is making|pg||
nt|chick: only problem is ... can he overcome his fear of 4-1 or 4-2 trump split in a red suit|pg||
nt|petergill: and then Fiona will probably pass, wanting one more diamond or one more highish card anywhere for 6NT|pg||
nt|ralfwil: With these two guys, you must be fast on the keyboard|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 4@S=620|pg||
nt|oleberg: If he gets diamonds right, which he will.|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 5@C=300 or 500|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Crikey, free lesson in Turkish|pg||
nt|mdgraham: is it really necessary to get to 2NT with the EW cards?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|paulhac:  Putting South to the test|pg||
nt|star6ija: 2@d game forcing|pg||
nt|tomi2:  he is mathematican and we often see him going for overtricks in games where he can go down, when he thinks odds are better than 95%|pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: Pani Agato! |pg||
nt|petergill: Fiona will like @D10, bulking up her long suit|pg||
pc|sK|nt|rigas_karo: maybe he thought declarer hand 6421|pg||
nt|andersk: same lead as open room, probably 11 and a push|pg||
nt|Gerben42: you never know yesterday I saw Greco Hampson making 3N on 11 vs 10|pg||
nt|peachy: somebody took a long time, I assume|pg||
nt|roswolf: looks very possible|pg||
nt|shevek: they had some intervention by west who showed the blacks, still....|pg||
nt|dburn: quite a lot may depend on the lead to 6NT - @c10 (or@c9 depending on methods) will not work well|pg||
nt|dburn: but this is dangerous|pg||
nt|petergill: Ralf, or you will be burned ... am I still allowed to commentate after that?  |pg||
nt|ralfwil: :)|pg||
nt|petergill: 6@C, in case West has 5 clubs|pg||
nt|dburn: although West probably ought to convert to 6NT...|pg||
nt|petergill: A conversion to 6NT would avoid the nasty 5-1 split|pg||
nt|petergill: With 4 clubs, East might have proceeded via "fourth suit forcing"|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|rnmalik: This board.|pg||
nt|peachy: and cant be but South|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes|pg||
nt|8252: il va falloir du bon timing ici|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It is when you open the East hand|pg||
nt|odysseus69: just what you dont want to hear when you open light in 3rd seat|pg||
pc|s6|nt|star6ija: 2N no 3@ss|pg||
nt|psridhar: note that S does not have values like unsupported king or queen sitting under the NT opener-he has a 'pure' hand|pg||
nt|chick: now a XX|pg||
nt|lesh: dangerous call|pg||
nt|chick: "pick another suit"|pg||
nt|lesh: he can even make 5@d|pg||
nt|lesh: 4@h and 5@d making but 3nt not |pg||
nt|chick: he can make 6H if he plays E for something like 4414 or 4405 ... losing 1 heart and no diamonds ... or am I missing something?|pg||
nt|james_h: I like Derek O'Gs raise|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: nice bid West|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: here is an example of a Vulnerable position safe for E-W|pg||
nt|brolucius: Not the sort of deal where you want to be playing against Italy...|pg||
nt|odysseus69: we are watching a Bocchi special- sadly I can offer no explanation|pg||
nt|bagman: 7@D here is a good contract|pg||
nt|Walddk2: How can you expect West to bid any less?|pg||
pc|s7|nt|paulhac:  E/wWhave done well to hold the loss to 5 Imps|pg||
nt|star6ija: well oriented|pg||
nt|haans: xy most popular checkback now|pg||
nt|star6ija: from East's hand @h lead may cause som damges|pg||
nt|star6ija: some|pg||
nt|star6ija: damages* :):)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: maybe 6nt is safest|pg||
nt|snetram:  wejÅcie 1 pik w niekorzystnych ambitne|pg||

nt|babs59: The chat about Scottish inventions had me googling additional Australian inventions.  I thought I needed to check facts |pg||
pc|s5|nt|collins64: just talk about why playing A@c on that 1st round|pg||
nt|boyklas: its possible|pg||
nt|ady: kib asking again for link to running scores please|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm not the expected lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/runningscores/asp/roundteamsconditstatclassicmod.asp?qtournid=817&qshowflag=1|pg||
nt|pitiful:  well this is not very interesting|pg||
nt|pitiful:  @c lead best|pg||
nt|lesh: opps 3nt also makes:) He has the entry for @d finess|pg||
nt|lesh: he can but it is impossible to bid|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i whispered he could pass to 3NX but seems was busy a lot and did not hear me|pg||
nt|chick: entry for @D finesse is a problem|pg||
nt|chick: and 6@C EW is makeable too, I think|pg||
nt|lesh: slams are makeable but it is diffucult to reach. |pg||
nt|chick: I dunno, I'd still keep trying to reach a red slam with N's hand|pg||
nt|lesh: from the bidding you know what 4@h are 4-1 at least and there is 4th @d in West|pg||
nt|chick: yes, that's what is scaring N into serious caution|pg||
nt|lesh: your partner is 0-5 points with 6+ spades|pg||
nt|lesh: you dont expect him have K@hxx and 109x in @d|pg||
nt|chick: and nothing wasted in @Ss :)|pg||
nt|aldek: ale konsekwentne|pg||
nt|barnets: yes even 7N makes|pg||
nt|odysseus69: when smoke clears I expect to see 7D|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|star6ija: still some communication problems|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: problems are arriving for N-S |pg||
nt|psridhar: but 3C x is painful all the same|pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: Przepraszam...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, that's avoided the 5-1 trump break |pg||
nt|dburn: good decision - now all East has to do is make it|pg||
nt|petergill: Good decision by Susan, but can 6NT be made?|pg||
nt|Walddk7: It can|pg||
nt|dburn: North will probably be squeezed in the majors even if East does not pick the clubs|pg||
nt|dburn: but on this auction South is not all that likely to lead the suit|pg||
nt|ralfwil: N is squeezed in majors|pg||
nt|Walddk7: She can get four club tricks by force|pg||
nt|petergill: South has to lead - what? - something ... the hearts and spades lie over West's holdings, reducing squeeze possibilities|pg||
nt|ralfwil: A squeese in more fun than a double finess:)|pg||
nt|Walddk7: If she is inspired and trust that @CJ is a singleton she has four tricks in the suit. The rest will come from diamonds|pg||
nt|petergill: East's 3rd heart might be a vital threat in this hand which even Fiona, usually a fast but careful player, will take a long time to play, surely|pg||
nt|Walddk7: She has just enough entries for all that|pg||
nt|dburn: but if South chooses the queen of hearts (which is dangerous), East may well go astray|pg||
nt|petergill: Sandra Rimstedt can hardly lead a club after this bidding, or will she?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: @HQ is a bit of a Flash Harry sort of lead|pg||
nt|ralfwil: When E can see a 5-card @c and a 4-card @d the squeeze is easy|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: always remember to make actions depending on the vul position |pg||
nt|barnets: and 7@H|pg||
nt|odysseus69: however many will open on West|pg||
pc|d2|nt|collins64: no Mike show count on J@d lead 7 cards so not possible |pg||
nt|MolvaM: to protect the @cQ and against bad breaks,|pg||
nt|justin c: looks like 5 losers here|pg||
nt|petergill: A low club lead is safe into the expected 4-3 fit - either partner has a bare @C honour or she does not|pg||
nt|Walddk7: That will likely give the show away|pg||
nt|dburn: well, that's a safe club to lead - declarer probably won't take four club tricks now|pg||
nt|petergill: NS lead 3rd and 5th versus both NT and suit|pg||
nt|Walddk7: I think she will, they lead 5th|pg||
nt|Walddk7: That's what I meant by giving the show away|pg||
nt|dburn: yes, but they also lead third - it would be a little vexing to lose to @cJ109 or the like with North|pg||
nt|petergill: A club lead from a 3 or 4 card holding is unlikely (being risky, might pick up partner's queen) on the bidding|pg||
nt|dburn: well, declarer lost her way at the other table, so this is a big chance for Fiona Brown|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: here is ths most advantaje Vulnerable position for a pair Non Vul - Vul = we are clear advantaje never hesitate to fight 1 more |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: remember te only bad safe is when you are getting paid 1 don and you decided to defend |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 1 down |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: as you can see West has no key cards to fight againtx 4@S|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ady: got of to a bad lead    but still defence can recover  South will need to play a low heart when in with A@S   and north will have to read the position|pg||
nt|star6ija: decided by the defense|pg||
nt|andreasw:  Magnusson in control here and chose 6@h|pg||
nt|tomi2:  if he exited with a heart, Versace could have won the Jack and give partner a @D ruff to "get back" the 2 imps Kirmse was working for, but we don't know the cards exactly|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: so good 5@C|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|roswolf: the lead was i think another sols flight of fancy|pg||
nt|shevek: good choice|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes had Mag bid a cue Harald would bid 6@d and Mag had to make a choise|pg||
nt|andreasw:  after 4nt from harald ofcourse|pg||
nt|MolvaM: spade lead?|pg||
nt|andreasw:  small @h lead but could cost the beating trick|pg||
nt|MolvaM: and then another spade (when in with @hA) could create problems|pg||
nt|andreasw:  i would lead the @c|pg||
nt|MolvaM: declarer must refrain from cashing diamonds|pg||
nt|lesh: opps|pg||
nt|chick: N did well not to double :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: okay, if the input is correct now i belived much to that old saying in BG. "The wolf has a thick neck, because he does his job on his own. "|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|mcarroll: :)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  worst lead would be @D|pg||
nt|lesh: that's better|pg||
nt|h_karluk: agreed|pg||
nt|marlowepi: car E pourrait avec honneur seche, et tu ne vas pas en tout cas faire l'impasse au 2e tour d'atout contre le 8 en tous cas|pg||
nt|mdgraham: true|pg||
pc|dK|nt|eweber: y and board 10 was a good 16 opposite 8 here|pg||
nt|peachy: NS in the other room preempted themselves from 4H, it can happen|pg||
nt|bogier: 1100 kosztowa³oby chyba|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But there is also a double squeeze if S has only a 4-card @d, so correctplay is to win on dummy, and play on @d|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is East who should be able to count 13 tricks at the end.|pg||
nt|bagman: 7@H is easy to play, win the first trick and play @HA and heart to the T|pg||
nt|bagman: How would you play 7NT?|pg||
nt|bagman: I would go for double squeeze|pg||
pc|d4|nt|odysseus69: slowly|pg||
pc|d8|nt|collins64: !2 on dummy singleton 3@d for declarer and Mike played 4@d and discard 5@d|pg||

nt|bagman: with spades as the pivot suit|pg||

nt|cumino: 4NT = 2Key|pg||
pc|dT|pg||

nt|ftpe: yes, a little lucky|pg||
nt|haans: really not bad|pg||
nt|haans: draw clubs and then spades = 3 spade tricks|pg||
nt|psridhar: Try as he might i dont see Herbst avoiding the 800|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: terry taking no chances ...|pg||
nt|james_h: but there are not many who do not|pg||
nt|petergill: She will pitch a spade and a heart from dummy on the @d's, to retain squeeze chances|pg||
pc|h3|nt|tomi2:  @DJ would be best|pg||
nt|tomi2:  wd|pg||
nt|ralfwil: well played and discard @h on @d|pg||

pc|h7|pg||

nt|Walddk7: regrets  even|pg||
nt|babs59: and Steve Waugh|pg||
pc|c3|nt|8252: correct|pg||
nt|brolucius: This is like a long arrow, heading straight for the bulls-eye.|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|eamongall: I think its time to hit the road back to swords ...if they play slow I will be home in time for the wake |pg||
nt|brolucius: Got there!|pg||
nt|odysseus69: old people like me dont mind responding 2C over 1D - is that so bizarre|pg||
pc|cA|nt|boyklas: by east sorry, he fillipos led small H manolis took the A and played a small D taking the A from the dummy so -1|pg||
nt|MolvaM: no problem|pg||
nt|MolvaM: dummy has a high heart|pg||
nt|andreasw:  still makeable|pg||
nt|psridhar: now 1100 even|pg||
nt|tomi2:  Smirnov Piekarek found some great defense against 3NT in board 10|pg||
nt|bagman: 7@D is more a bidding problem than a play problem. With trumps breaking it's easy to take a heart ruff|pg||
nt|cumino: Spade lead board 10 in 3NT|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|Gerben42: also an option to pass 1@H, then reaching 3/4@H is likely|pg||
nt|andreasw:  but a nice try|pg||
nt|petergill: When North showed out in clubs, Fiona will smartly think about North having length in both majors and being squeezable|pg||

nt|brolucius: 2@C was forcing to game, so I suppose a 2@S continuation covers all the spade raises.|pg||

nt|jameslee 2: 15/1 up|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 4- is not a part score not much dange on this x|pg||
nt|oleberg: Or at least the double shows, that diamonds is controlled, and south should be vary, leading from honours|pg||
nt|ralfwil: this lead makes that N can win the @d immediately and return another @s|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: tricks count |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: East |pg||
nt|oleberg: 3@D must have been invitational, so the double is "safe"|pg||

nt|jameslee 2: he needs to develope the @D |pg||
nt|ralfwil: only 6 tricks from top, so let us see|pg||
nt|oleberg: the lead is a killer|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: sorry 6 yes |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: remember siesta time for Spanish people |pg||

nt|jameslee 2: Siesta= good life in spain / relax moment and here we are fighting in this match :)|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||

nt|Walddk2: So they go through 2NT with a balanced heart raise|pg||
pc|d2|nt|boyklas: 5C at boar 12|pg||

nt|andersk: this contract is not makeable|pg||
nt|pitiful:  i saw symonds play the other night for Surrey|pg||
pc|d4|nt|haans: do not understand low spade|pg||
nt|Walddk7: At TGR they would probably play this in 3NT in order collect 150 honours|pg||
nt|petergill: This gives declarer an entry to dummy for the doomed trump finesse|pg||
pc|dK|nt|boyklas: boar|pg||
nt|shevek: I think it also suggests shortage in @h|pg||
nt|chick: can make 6, but I predict only 5 ... will set up @Ds, they will knock out the other @S stopper, and he won't dare take the @H finesse|pg||
nt|petergill: Declarer has to misguess a lot in order to fail|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Welcome to Jaap Frijling|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|collins64: Mike 14 HCP opening is not going to run good here|pg||
nt|eweber: wow, another 11 for NL|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Spade lead looked normal|pg||
nt|athene: lauria-versace got some way towards 4@H - just not all the way|pg||
nt|pitiful:  you mentioned flash boys|pg||
nt|lesh: with doubleton Q@d and Q@c and @H finess working he can even make 12 tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That is an excellent switch, it will set up a club trick in time|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|peachy: 3Nt was better since hearts 4-4, but one never knows|pg||
nt|chick: hmm, now he may have to take the @H finesse|pg||
nt|lesh: however,what is more important is to make your contract|pg||

pc|d5|nt|rnmalik: cannot rule out an error by the defense.|pg||

nt|MolvaM: the iceland pairs doing extremely well in the event|pg||

pc|d3|nt|MolvaM: one pair ranked 1st in butler with 1,66 imp/board|pg||
nt|MolvaM: other 2 pairs also high with 0,84 and 0,3 plus|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 1,66 imp average over 100 boards is phenomenal|pg||
nt|xenya: well at least it served as a lead director|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 9@D a very strong card in N|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|Gerben42: thanks to the 3@S opener|pg||
nt|bagman: The defense can get 800 if they make no mistake. Often a trick is dropped|pg||
nt|bagman: and declarer escapes with -500|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Oh well, not when West did not win the first diamond|pg||
pc|sA|nt|boyklas: Dehaye didnt find the S lead so again some imps for greece|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 8 tricks|pg||
nt|petergill: Their system wrongsided the hand - "calling a spade a spade" works a bit better on this hand|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 800?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Some players drop fewer tricks than others.|pg||
pc|s8|nt|h_karluk: yesterday i was in Florence SC, USA sectional, a young lady offered me for an interview to their local TV channel. Her question was "what's the best thing in this game". I think ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 'try to improve your judgement skills' was a fair answer.|pg||
nt|petergill: OK now|pg||
nt|bagman: These guys here drop fewer but even they drop tricks in defense|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Then the suit would be blocked and no entry to @DJ|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Gerben42: 3NT is a claimer|pg||
nt|roswolf: israel made 4@S ON 9 BUT had some opp bidding to help them|pg||

nt|othered1: ty|pg||

nt|Walddk2: The operation was successful, but .....|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now it may even make|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Lauria has a feeling that hearts are 5-1, so I think he will make it from here|pg||

nt|andersk: OMG|pg||
nt|xenya: only 10 tricks now -- in the other room, i think, a spade was led|pg||

nt|jameslee 2: 500 |pg||

nt|andersk: 2,5 minutes left|pg||
nt|ady: now 7|pg||
nt|shevek: this one looks like yet another one :)|pg||
nt|othered1: Declarer is looking for best way to 10 tricks, not for an overtrick|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They knighted him for that??|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|Gerben42: if they win 22-8 they have 39, which is not great but getting back in|pg||
nt|ady: tried for 9|pg||
nt|MolvaM: for me a good match is when I win it|pg||
nt|brolucius: If this sort of deal appears in a problem book (where you are meant to see if you can deal with bad breaks in hearts and/or clubs), I usually turn the page to see the answer ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: straight away. I suppose - somewhere in the  universe - there is a hard-working bridge player who spends ages trying to work out the answers to such problems.|pg||
nt|james_h: North has only shown the @s for his effort => he has the @c K|pg||

nt|babs59: Don't you have Sir Ian Botham?|pg||

nt|babs59: here's a kib's contribution to that:  he was knighted for his contribution to alcohol consumption...|pg||

nt|othered1: The @C duck isn't a play I had foreseen.|pg||

pc|d7|pg||
nt|dburn: careful play, that @sQ, just in case West was doing something fiendish|pg||
nt|petergill: 650 - she could safely have got 680 after @C7 then @C8 by East - only an overtrick  |pg||
nt|ralfwil: but N didn´t use the count|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c4|nt|Walddk2: He played as soon as he saw your comment|pg||
pc|h4|pc|cK|pg||
nt|oleberg: East's strenght, (and placement of highcards) is unknown, so the defence goes for the sure set, happy to defeat a contract, that might have made if not for the double|pg||
nt|bagman: Now the @DQ|pg||
nt|barnets: still dont see a line to make 6@H|pg||
nt|brolucius: A bit like two lions on a wildebeest.|pg||

nt|h_karluk: i always enjoy, never let anybody ruins my day|pg||

nt|eweber: if the medals were given for speed this table would probably qualify :)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: they will have to wait for their partners quite some time throughout the tournament|pg||
nt|Gerben42: Bauke Muller is not known to be fast|pg||
nt|eweber: 1@d here showed 11-16 with 4+ @d, unbalanced|pg||
nt|Gerben42: showing 4+@D paid off here|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 5@S still cheap for 300|pg||
nt|eweber: and the limit is useful as well|pg||
nt|eweber: in such auctions|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 6@D must be defended carefully, but I think after @S2 lead Drijver will get it|pg||
nt|eweber: with 7 hcp in @s 5@s is an option|pg||
nt|vasmar: double now|pg||
nt|ady: played a diamond to the 9 early on to make 4@S on board 9|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D game try in hearts perhaps but NS should wander into 4@S without too much difficulty |pg||
nt|athene: 3@S pass 4@S now|pg||

nt|justin c: might try 6@H here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They gave him a chance to shine, and he grabbed it|pg||

mb|2N|nt|shevek: Unfortunately losing 2@h - 1@d - 1@c|pg||

nt|petergill: OK, David is right, if @SK was from KJ doubleton the play for the overtrick risks the contract|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: the normal action practicly is ths K@C from KQ ending the defence  I enjoyed that detail|pg||
nt|odysseus69: that means there snt 1 - I never try for unbid slams- not enough grey cells|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: could be passed out?|pg||

mb|3C|nt|vugraphzng: the CR send me -2 will check|pg||
nt|andersk: ok|pg||
nt|brolucius: E/W play the weak 1NT, as we saw a deal or two ago, so they open 1@D here.|pg||
nt|jkotor: 1nt i think|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - ou 500 Ã¡ 5 @D X|pg||
nt|petergill: maybe|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@H 11-16, usually at least 5|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: at least the auction heated up some :)|pg||
nt|eweber: no double?|pg||
nt|tomi2:  1@S might have longer clubs than spades, I hope he alerted this :)|pg||
nt|andersk: stoppage time now|pg||
nt|haans: Cullin have it|pg||
nt|ady: very thin balance|pg||
nt|athene: now we have to find the club lead|pg||

mb|3H|nt|collins64: 5@c just made for Greece|pg||
nt|santyclz: Protecting the @hAQ.  Didn't see that coming.|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt not a bad shot - even when a minor-suit lead is right for the defence it's going to be hard for east to find it|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: West trying to disturb bidding |pg||
nt|h_karluk: x and cue|pg||
mb|p|nt|vasmar: small diamond lead :)|pg||
nt|pitiful:  2@s will play ok|pg||
nt|MolvaM: academic now|pg||
nt|xenya: back to life|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 4@D?|pg||

nt|jameslee 2: 5/4/4/0 ?showing shape with void @C |pg||
nt|oleberg: Yes|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Do you all pass as S after 1@s opening? not for me. 3@c|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: nice |pg||
nt|oleberg: after 2@S 2NT would have shown a balanced hand|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: lets see if West  can stop in game |pg||
mb|3S|nt|ziff:  No insider jokes please :)|pg||
nt|tomi2:  maybe there will be an appeal and in september they will decide...|pg||

nt|andersk: OMG ITALY MISSED FROM 5 meters 5 min over stopppage time|pg||
nt|haans: 6@D a make if @H lead|pg||
nt|yuval10: small @s would've been great|pg||
nt|yuval10: then they force declarer|pg||
nt|haans: more likely that E have the Q rather than A = weaker hand|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: they must be aware they having a poor set so might go for 6@h|pg||
nt|oleberg: 3@C and higher shows the intire distribution|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzng: NO DOUBLE APPARENTLY|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: sorry for upcqse|pg||
nt|Gerben42: Rudakov didnt know what 5@D showed in defense and Khven didn't count on @DA I guess|pg||
nt|paulhac:  An OK slam|pg||
nt|lmeili: how to show longer @d than @s?|pg||
nt|mamos: was 2@h single or two suited ?  the latter I think|pg||
nt|shevek: phantom got in the way|pg||
nt|MolvaM: tahts the problems with phantoms|pg||
nt|shevek: won't cost much though|pg||
nt|MolvaM: they should stick to hanging out in the operas|pg||
nt|babs59: we've also seen one from Russia on board 2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2NT=transfer to 3@C, either sign-off, balanced slam try or a slam try with 6+@H |pg||
mb|4C|nt|shevek: will get away with -50|pg||
nt|shevek: instead of +50|pg||
nt|mdgraham: could also be a sign-off in hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzng: seems to be clqi;end for -2, correction will come later if needed|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Diamonds 3-3 or doubleton J|pg||
nt|andersk: I have to go for a few|pg||
nt|tomi2:  he upgraded his hand to 18 with those aces and kings|pg||
nt|snetram:  teraz operator|pg||
nt|babs59: Will they be able to stop short of slam now?|pg||
mb|4D|nt|vasmar: now small diamond works also|pg||
nt|vasmar: if S misguesses|pg||
nt|ady: low diamond lead will beat this|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: puppet + 3@s showing hearts|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: there he is nice 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|eweber: non vul doubling for -1 is a bad bargain when the contract may be made, none of them knows about the opther one's quick tricks|pg||
nt|ady: thlow spade lead also good enough|pg||
nt|mamos: just Hearts I'm told|pg||
nt|andreasw:  they were not in 4@s|pg||
nt|shevek: phantoms , yes :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Ivan was good enough to find it, grats|pg||

nt|oleberg: Well, 12 tricks are easy, on the friendly lay.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 6@s as @d are AJ|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: hand 13 playing 3NT but other side & not X |pg||
nt|odysseus69: it seems that nobody knows what to expecxt from preempts - its because players are varying them so much|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't think so, and slam is not that bad|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's basically on a finesse|pg||
nt|babs59: 6@C is the best slam|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6@C can make when diamonds are 3-3 or queen doubleton|pg||
mb|4N|nt|peachy: nicely judged|pg||
nt|peachy: as it is, 12 tricks|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Unless he takes a diamond finesse|pg||
nt|peachy: if they duck club, it will be testy|pg||
nt|brolucius: If yo use 12-14 and 15-17 as your ranges for 1NT and the 1NT rebid, a jump rebid of 2NT shows 18-19. They must do something different since West has only 17 here.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Hardly worth an upgrade, with those intermediates, it would seem.|pg||
nt|tomi2:  @S2 gives you the count of the spades, they should behave 4-4|pg||
nt|othered1: Giving an extra Work point or two when  you have only aces and kings is reasaonable, perhaps mandatory|pg||
nt|bagman: NS had 5@C or 5@D, going 1 or 2 down in 4@S is no disaster here|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: heart contract for 9 tricks best  |pg||
nt|haans: he had been thinking|pg||
nt|mcarroll: They dont listen to you Hans :)|pg||
nt|haans: see that|pg||
nt|haans: why not clubs to 9|pg||
nt|star6ija: 3rd hand plays high?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 6 clubs needs help from defence - preferably diamond lead- 6NT no chance |pg||
mb|5H|nt|rigas_karo: well, at least this is NV :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: might be a few twists and turns though|pg||
nt|star6ija: no entries for dummy|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 4@H+2 =480 |pg||
mb|p|nt|andersk: ty|pg||
nt|Gerben42: @H ruff is -2 |pg||
nt|yuval10: she indeed misguessed|pg||
nt|athene: small club after the @DA gives declarer a nasty moment but the odds must be to rise king|pg||
nt|athene: west would indeed lead low from @CQJxx, knowing the suit has to run, but it's more likely he simply has the ace|pg||
nt|aldek: non-vulnerable could be very weak|pg||
nt|mamos: not a great bid then imho   it made any exploration of the hands here impossible|pg||
nt|shevek: Thomas would've bid 4@s if it came around|pg||
nt|andreasw:  and then u could bid 5@c with the risk of being dbl but still u never now|pg||
nt|shevek: true, they bid it to make|pg||

nt|marlowepi: en toute probabilite, 300 a 5Kx je crois|pg||
nt|justin c: west might have preferred 4@C to 4@h |pg||
nt|petergill: NS play Two Way Checkback after 1@H - 1@S - 1NT|pg||
nt|petergill: so 2@C would have been artificial|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: instead E is playing West|pg||
nt|babs59: you can discard the 3rd @D on the @H, when @DQ doesn't drop - then @S to dummy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why help, Victor?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You pitch a diamond on a heart|pg||
nt|odysseus69: take me through play please|pg||
mb|6C|nt|shevek: flat board|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes|pg||

mb|p|nt|haans: @H to Q and they forget to take two @D|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 3@D we can take it as a trial bid |pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: they did forget|pg||
nt|antoniz: tak jest -1|pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: 2@D,2@S,2@C|pg||
nt|justin c: but unclear whether East can cooperate over that|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: good lead, gives nothing away|pg||
nt|lesh: thanks everyone, I have to go|pg||
nt|babs59: however, 6@C (by South) on a @S lead is trickier|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It is true that a spade lead kills the entry|pg||
nt|babs59: I missed the ruffing the 13th @D good, before going back to the @S - so 5 clubs, 3 hearts, 3 diamonds, 1 spade|pg||
nt|odysseus69: I see how but is that likely line- and of couse spade lead finishes it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, but there is an alternative, and losing, line|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe even a better one|pg||
nt|babs59: Just one?  I see the @D finesse, or trying for short @SA, or a squeeze|pg||
nt|Walddk2: diamond finesse in combination with @SA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: doubleton|pg||
pc|c8|nt|pitiful:  well if that is your style and it works well for you you tend to stick to it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Kaplan & Rubens Hand Evaluator|pg||
nt|tomi2:  we will need some undo here|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|nt|dburn: looks natural to play a spade now, but I don't think it will work|pg||
nt|odysseus69: and as my friend Tony Waterlow pointed out if he guesses to play spade Q on Jack he is stil ok - all very inspired|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|ady: no way to make unless north discards 2 clubs when hearts are run|pg||
nt|chick: thanks Jivko@H@H|pg||
nt|aldek: 2BA nie mozna przegrac|pg||
nt|oleberg: The underlead looked costly, but gained a trick|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You need @SK as an entry if you go for diamonds (no finesse)|pg||
pc|cK|nt|vasmar: plenty of tricks now for N-S nut not enough ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 18.3 on the K&R so an upgrade was fine|pg||
pc|c5|nt|rigas_karo: @d now for -3|pg||
nt|yuval10: big board for Germany|pg||
nt|ady: south likely to discard 2 diamonds and a club|pg||
nt|roswolf: well i think this can make by force but timing needs to be exacrt|pg||
pc|c3|nt|brolucius: Declarer went against Restricted Choice in the heart suit.|pg||
nt|jkotor: Janusz jedn¹ lewê zdejmij|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|paulhac:  He may be able to work out the distribution in which case he may well go off|pg||
nt|peachy: cashing spades to get information on shapes and discards, not sure if it will help him|pg||
nt|santyclz: I'm sure I could convince myself to go wrong there.|pg||
nt|athene: now Mari gets squeezed in the minors|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: sweden made another 5 Imp,s move on board 13|pg||
nt|h_karluk: c u Jivko|pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: A, tak jedno Karo i jedno Pik jest wspólne...|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|tomi2:  couldnt he first duck out a club?|pg||
nt|brolucius: 10-x or J-x with South was more likely than J-10-x.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, as a matter of principle they don't read books by Englishmen. They beat them in football instead|pg||
nt|tomi2:  :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: A matter of Principle.|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ziff:  Don t listen, Phoebe, it is about an appeal in Germany in another sequence where a possible canape was not alerted|pg||
nt|odysseus69: anyway Versace plays quickly so we will see soon|pg||
pc|c9|nt|mcarroll: Has to keep @D3 as 2nd @D entry to dummy|pg||
nt|petergill: Would a @H to the ace and the club finesse work better?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: helpful duck/|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|dburn: although it will now - West needed to win that trick|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Diamond finesse is strictly 50%. Not sure what the other line is, the winning one|pg||
nt|odysseus69: may even see d 10|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|peachy: defense is not helping at all:) wd|pg||

nt|oleberg: Being a passed hand, 1NT is no longer a relay|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and now the escape methods can get wheeled out |pg||
mb|r|nt|paulg:  4@d an unusual bid with 4-4 minors, but unlucky to suffer this fate compared to 4@c|pg||

nt|pitiful:  and one east 6@d redoubled !|pg||

nt|psridhar: Fredin is quite active making 3 bids ( so far) on his aceless minimum|pg||

mb|p|nt|shevek: 14-16|pg||
mb|p|nt|rigas_karo: 5 top tricks for the defence|pg||
nt|motu: 5@D says nothing about other kings but East is limited to 14 so another K is not possible|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: nice lead from North we must say so |pg||
nt|odysseus69: 2 service breaks for Murray in 3rd set|pg||
pc|s3|nt|boyklas: 16-18 Balanced|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Trump split painful for declarer|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You can have 1NT as a transfer to 2@C|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am told: Duboin makes 3NT on 14. gets @s2 and shoots a @s straight back! When nobody wants to cash out the spades, he ducks a club.|pg||
nt|tomi2:  In poland 99.9 % play non forcing, in Germany we have lots of influences in bidding and defense, some from French bidding style, some from American books and some from Polish players, because some German players are Polish origin, like Piekarek |pg||
nt|ryskiel_: i wemie|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 7 tricks now|pg||
nt|barnets: not really a good effort by them|pg||

pc|sT|nt|tomi2:  voila|pg||

nt|mdgraham: it's funny how when you start redoubling here, you just know that the final contract is going to be two of something doubled  |pg||
pc|s5|nt|rnmalik: 11 tricks.|pg||
nt|ady: dont think east's pass wrong    has already shown values with 2NT|pg||
nt|ady: north sure to get diamonds right|pg||
nt|roswolf: west might/should have bid 4@H but i would have done more as east on this auction|pg||
nt|psridhar: whatever their methods were , this 2nt is not pretty on club lead|pg||
nt|psridhar: i fancy -200|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|shevek: no they play mini NT not vul (10-12)|pg||
nt|tomi2:  in the OR, so you see some pairs playing SEF based style, some 2/1 and some use polish club and polish style bids and carding|pg||
nt|8252: il protège les @c en duquant, et espère l'AS d'atout an Nord, ou un gisement des @s favorable|pg||
nt|bagman: This lead was quite helpful for the declarer. With the cards being nice it did not matter much, however|pg||
nt|mdgraham: or, as happened on a memorable occasion, four of something doubled|pg||
nt|odysseus69: not too many entries to South|pg||
pc|hK|nt|paulg:  at least he can pitch a heart on the fourth spade|pg||
nt|hawe45:  120 - next|pg||
nt|shevek: http://tinyurl.com/29ud57z|pg||
pc|h9|nt|collins64: A@c for the 10@c|pg||
nt|pitiful:  probably watching the cricket with Roland...|pg||
nt|pitiful:  looks like 9 tricks here|pg||
nt|xenya: now 2 hearts pitching 2 diamonds -- that must be his plan?|pg||
nt|ftpe: he probably knows cl 3-3, so maybe will play on clubs|pg||
nt|xenya: but that would lead to a defeat i think -- discarding diamonds i mean|pg||
nt|xenya: and trying to ruff a @D loser in the dimmy|pg||
pc|h6|nt|haans: many plax xx as forcing to at lead 2nt|pg||
nt|brolucius: It will be interesting to see how many pairs reach 7@D. Perhaps a majority at this level.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: now David did you say you wanted to be kept up to date with cricket?|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|collins64: and @s|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: creative bidding would  be my guess:)|pg||
nt|paulg:  although not an ideal start to a doubled four-level contract|pg||
nt|haans: just to tease|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|vasmar: club was not a success|pg||
nt|star6ija: 3rd trump trick apeared|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ziff:  Of course he didn t lead @H8 as he had no idea where @HA is, but it would sure have been fun :)|pg||
nt|psridhar: S will duck dia queen to cut declarer off his hand|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 23/19 getting closer te match |pg||
nt|psridhar: perhpas Fallenius might hv tried 2S over Fredin's 2D- a much better spot than 2nt|pg||
nt|haans: so fredin just had to countinue bidding|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 2nt a contract you bid but you never play|pg||

pc|h8|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: same|pg||
nt|xenya: in the OR, the lead was a safe a heart |pg||
nt|psridhar: Russia up 4--15 vs Ireland with one bd to go|pg||
nt|marlowepi: mieux|pg||
nt|me argent: mais avec les 2K noir mal places il va chuter|pg||
nt|ritong: il est tres probable que l autre salle atteindra aussi ce tres bon contrat|pg||
nt|bernix: .|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: needs to refrain from ruffing here make declarers life abit harder|pg||
pc|c8|nt|vasmar: there may be a club spade squeeze|pg||
nt|psridhar: 40-15|pg||
nt|mdgraham: years ago in the Spring Foursomes - partner and I doubled 2@D. The oppo removed, and ended in 4@Dx. Not a success |pg||
pc|c3|nt|paulg:  bidding 4@c would have given someone the option of running if doubled (although never easy to work out when to run) ... 4@d has no such safety valve|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Could easily play East for KQ@C doubleton and go for 800|pg||
nt|xenya: well now he MUST discard diamonds on the hearts |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: big smash there fron denmark |pg||
nt|odysseus69: I hear that Hacketts bid 6NT|pg||
nt|bagman: declarer is still going to lose a spade and a diamond|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Back to that slam on 14. At one table where the contract was 6NT, West avoided the diamond lead, but the contract still made when East rose with the ace (low spade from dummy)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: better to win spade ace and take 2 ruffs then diamond jack gets promoted|pg||
pc|cA|nt|pitiful:  didn't cash their @s|pg||
nt|tomi2:  as predicted Italy won 3NT over there, dubion exited with a spade and had tempo to try the clubs because he knew the @S split|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|pitiful:  11 now|pg||
nt|psridhar: Bulagria leading italy 33-25 with one Bd o go|pg||
nt|8252: oui, mais entre le chelem de tout à l'heure, et ce 4 @s, la carte se montre méchante cet après midi pour E W|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|rigas_karo: @s cannot go anywhere|pg||
nt|ady: Israel got 11 on board 12  where they could take all the hearts and ace of spades in 3NT|pg||
nt|babs59: the @DJ will be promoted here anyway - or the @D7 even|pg||
pc|cK|nt|jameslee 2: that,s good headlines news good job Padma |pg||

pc|c5|nt|petergill: Might be an imp to Sweden here|pg||
nt|jaapfr: the imo sub marginal 1@D creates 2 imps for opps|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A match like this is particularly imprtant because both nations will advance to the finals. VPs against the eight other qualifiers are carried forward|pg||
nt|brolucius: Not a happy moment for the defenders.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Il est ou - le resultat de donne  15|pg||

pc|hJ|pg||
nt|ftpe: cant be rigth|pg||

nt|peachy: a counteroffer|pg||
nt|peachy: sry guys|pg||
nt|santyclz: Not in @ds.  A good sign.|pg||
nt|tomi2:  the field is relatively close and Germany is around 15VP in front of 10th, so it would also be important to score well against the non-qualifiers too|pg||

mb|p|nt|rnmalik: Interesting hand.|pg||
nt|james_h: oooh baby|pg||
mb|p|nt|andersk: Not any boards from live page updated from this match, yet. I have a feeling 2 boards are misscoored, for +3 IMP to Croatia|pg||
nt|rnmalik: would require good play to make this contract.|pg||
nt|paulg:  As well as starting much later on Saturday, you'll only have 16 board matches in the Seniors|pg||
nt|brolucius: Perhaps you are not English?|pg||
nt|barnets: is 100 a good score at cricket ?|pg||
nt|bagman: maybe that's the explanation|pg||

nt|jameslee 2: 1@H = 4 card @S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In the finals the 9 teams from one group will play against the 9 from the other group and an aggregate score is calculated|pg||
nt|tomi2:  Italy and Iceland have quite confortable leads, they can try to relax in matches agains teams, that will be relegated for sure and save some energy and avoid time penalties (don't know if penalties are also carried into 2nd RR)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Six teams will qualify for the Bermuda Bowl - the top six in the second round-robin. At the moment the field is split into two, so around the top 3 in each section may be seen as ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: the top contenders at present. But there is some luck involved in which of your scores are dropped after the first round-robin.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Penalties are carried forward if both teams qualify, not if only one of them|pg||
nt|chick: with the diamond finesse working and a good guess in clubs, he can make 6|pg||

nt|jameslee 2: 4@S= 10 tricks |pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's stated in the bulletins|pg||
nt|odysseus69: te he Italian philosophy is to bid all suits where there is possible weakness - most Brits would simply bid 3NT after Stayman|pg||
nt|barnets: hacketts stopped in 4@H so we dont get to see if they can make it|pg||
nt|barnets: they led a diamond so prob just as well they stopped|pg||
nt|barnets: @D is tthe best lead for defense|pg||
pc|dA|nt|santyclz: N might have been contemplating a @h raise there.|pg||
nt|xenya: seems any reasonable line will succeed here|pg||

pc|dJ|pc|d3|nt|rigas_karo: ruff a @c, @s and claim... next board|pg||
nt|eweber: many diamonds with NE here|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer might take the club finesse now|pg||
nt|odysseus69: going to lose club to bare q maybe- however he does not have entries if North has qxxx so maybe not|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|Gerben42: this will somehow make I gues|pg||
nt|Gerben42: even though only 8 tricks are clear, all those 10 will trouble EW|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: this looks makeable - whats the best way to handle diamonds ?  guess @dA and ruff one ... |pg||
nt|petergill: South played the opening bidder for @HQ on the last hand in order to make up her 12 HCP for her opening bid - surely?|pg||
pc|d7|nt|vasmar: but now she has to find diamonds|pg||
nt|andreasw:  im hopefully not:)|pg||
nt|ftpe: sotuh knows that north has 0 points|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am told that Netherlands qill qualify for BB as hosts. So there may be 6 more Euro qualifiers, making 7 in all.|pg||
nt|petergill: that's why it was 120|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but a finesse could not lose imo|pg||

pc|s5|pg||
nt|Gerben42: but has to take care of communication to make his 9th trick|pg||
nt|Gerben42: might get stranded with @HA|pg||
nt|eweber: playing @h first might help, but both J and K are wrongsided|pg||
nt|ady: trying to steal 7the trick|pg||
nt|bernix: with trump 2/2 no way to go down|pg||
pc|d8|nt|andersk: fortunate @C split|pg||

nt|kdr_fm: ya but he doesnt know all this :> if u didnt see the opps cards whats the best line - spades 3/1 and diamonds 4/2 can u still do it ?|pg||
nt|bagman: The proble playing @CA and J is that if S covers, you don't know what to do|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|Gerben42: likely to go down now unless he finds @HJ|pg||

nt|Gerben42: as I thought, @D 6-1 led him to think Khven simply ducked|pg||
nt|eweber: now he has a new problem|pg||
nt|Gerben42: but if so, why not play @C2 instead|pg||
nt|Gerben42: even if he finds @HJ will go down now|pg||
nt|eweber: I assume he was hoping to endplay West with Kxx|pg||

nt|petergill: West needs perfect cards for slam - Axx, AQxx, xxx, Qxx - so she wisely passes  |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: declarer not with many tricks looks an imposible contract|pg||
mb|d|nt|eweber: a festival for the weak NT players who find their @s fit :)|pg||

nt|haans: He asked and got NO|pg||
nt|pitiful:  this is a nice spot for e-w|pg||
nt|ftpe: 3 nt was hard bid|pg||

nt|ftpe: punish will come, even if lucky lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Fleisher-Kamil, Weinstein-Levin, Stansby-Martel|pg||
nt|tomi2:  I am not a fan of redoubles with hands that have only one thing to say... "I have support and some values". Redouble for me should mean "I want to double the opps" but it is so unlikely for W that he will get opps...|pg||
nt|brolucius: If you play negative bids over a double, you need to use redouble more - I guess.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Funnily enough this is all about @HQ, is it now?|pg||
nt|othered1: I prefer redouble denies fit, unless game force.|pg||
nt|tomi2:  more often opps will preempt you in spades and partner will not know about your fit when its his turn to bid. You should have a bid in your system to show a constructive or invitational raise directly|pg||
nt|tomi2:  best again is to use transfers :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: transfers are useful in many sequences but no-one ever seems to write a magazine article about them. (Must prefer to keep the advantages to themselves...)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Gromöller is a hot favourite to go down. He must lose two spades and one diamond, and why would he play South for @HQ after the take-out double?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: rumen va d abord essayer de faire tomber le @d V|pg||
nt|odysseus69: are tese the cards they are bidding?|pg||

nt|barnets: why not?|pg||
nt|barnets: 3@H invite with hearts|pg||
nt|barnets: 3@S is forcing|pg||
nt|barnets: 3N lets try it|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: and thought well:)|pg||
nt|tomi2:  my gues is: his intention was "pd pls bid 3nt with a spade stopper"|pg||
nt|athene: it could easily give tricks away|pg||

nt|kdr_fm: good question Eamon - most events have a final B with the top x teams allowed back in ... not sure|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 9 tricks as long as  he gets trumps right|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: N was sort of endplayed on the lead -- any suit he might lead (except @Cs) gives away a trick|pg||
nt|psridhar: are they saving vul vs nv on a 4-4? looks 500 to me|pg||
nt|bernix: there is a transnational. i'd prefer golf|pg||
pc|h6|nt|paulg:  12 tricks looks a lot at the other table|pg||
nt|haans: play clubs at sonest|pg||
nt|haans: soonest|pg||
nt|vasmar: i think that in hearts there are a lot of tricks for N-S|pg||
nt|pitiful:  should make 10 on the layout|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: after @H North will be told where to go after with a signal|pg||
nt|barnets: 4@H I have a good card in your suit|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3@H looks like a bit of a punt on that suit, when vulnerable. Why not 1NT? Jump shifts are invitational.|pg||
nt|cumino: 3NT was a good feeling by Gold|pg||
nt|odysseus69: over 1s- with Axxxxx- dont please tell me this is the way to bid in 2010- it wont catch on in our street|pg||
nt|barnets: agree better to have the  @H10 in north|pg||
nt|brolucius: And the @HJ. |pg||
nt|odysseus69: and he will now|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the double of 3@S looks a bit of a pairs bid|pg||
pc|h2|nt|santyclz: @c back looks safer than @d.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Still tempting though|pg||
nt|shevek: coffee hand is when you need to go to the bathroom and pretend you go to the kitchen :)|pg||
nt|chick: in any case, EW found a makeable game|pg||
nt|chick: won't be easy with the awful trump split, but he has a lot of resources outside of trump|pg||
nt|me argent: tout marche pour lui|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|haans: true always is|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: good 4@S if -1 =200 for a 420 opps |pg||
nt|ritong: si ça ne marche pas, il lui restera la solution des @ss|pg||
nt|8252: oui, mais bon coloris, à SA, -10 au lieu de - 11 :)|pg||
nt|ritong: mais ça marchera|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Probably as the double must suggest good defensive values for his weak 2|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Looks like 12 on this lead also|pg||
nt|vasmar: now 1NT will go 1 off probably|pg||
nt|vasmar: 4 hearts + 3 Aces|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: but seems a 500 againtx a 420|pg||
nt|mdgraham: after all, can he really underwrite two off?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: how to convert +100 into -730|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mcarroll: not enough dummy entries to trap @HK so will lose 2@D,1@S and the @HK|pg||
nt|haans: sweden DOWN|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3@D should be gf and if so west could have bid 3@S when a slam would be reached|pg||
nt|lechcold: do taryfy chyba brakuje 2 Impów?|pg||
nt|petergill: There are far more hands where 5@H goes down than ones where 6@h makes, excellent judgement by Stockdale|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: I think he will discard a @C|pg||
nt|brolucius: It's a Young Chelsea bid.|pg||
nt|bagman: If N has what he's supposed to have, S might have passed|pg||
nt|barnets: @HA109854|pg||
nt|barnets: the !J makes it a strong jump shift|pg||
nt|barnets: kidding|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|athene: declarer really played a diamond, not a trump, at trick 2?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Doesn't seems likely.|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 2@C = mean = @D |pg||
pc|d2|nt|rnmalik: Cant play @S that would squeeze the hand.|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|eweber: ... or play 1@c|pg||
nt|lmeili: wd!|pg||
nt|MolvaM: coffee hands are the type of hands that allow you to go and get a cup of coffee from the kitchen without worrying about what extremely clever remark you can do here as commentator|pg||
nt|tomi2:  he knows now @DQ in north, so not many points left for south. maybe some bad clue, but better than no clue ;)|pg||
nt|othered1: north might have ruffed to play @S through, at possible cost of trump trick|pg||
nt|tomi2:  I am told that the systematic meaning of xx is "10+, often no @H fit", hmm|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Club exit won't help declarer|pg||
nt|brolucius: Clever line of play.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: North rates to have more hearts than South after the double, so it would be against the odds to finesse through South|pg||
nt|brolucius: More important to have your hand in the bulletin than to actually win the match.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Versace could easily have had @CQ instead of @HQ|pg||
nt|tomi2:  spades should be 4-4|pg||
nt|othered1: Whne I play @DK from dummy, south's lead was from J10xx|pg||
nt|tomi2:  dias are 2north and 3 south|pg||
nt|lechcold: kto by siê tego spodziewa³? du¿a, przyjemna niespodzianka|pg||
nt|eamongall: but wait ...at first glance greece have 3 plus scores on 18-20 ...there might be some singing yet in austria |pg||
pc|h8|pc|h3|nt|Gerben42: 1@C is forcing for me :)|pg||
nt|eweber: for those who don't know, Gerben preferably plays Fantunes|pg||
nt|tomi2:  so if clubs are 4-4, north has longer hearts, if 5-3 south has longer hearts|pg||
nt|barnets: probably north could not invite going thru 1N|pg||
nt|cumino: He can survive|pg||
nt|brolucius: I can't see that 3@H is any sort of disciplined bid. I am rather disappointed by it. |pg||
pc|s4|nt|haans: and he should have|pg||
nt|andreasw:  for me it's smooking hand:)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  smoking|pg||
nt|ftpe: 1 nt opening showing 15-17, having 8 as prd, pass is rigth i think, max. is 25 and 8 had no extra|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|tomi2:  and having 4 spades is enough for an Italian player to double, can't remember an Italian TO double on 4144 :)|pg||
nt|barnets: so had to make a choice of the lesser of 2 evils|pg||
pc|d4|nt|cumino: sry private|pg||
nt|barnets: if he bids 1N what is his next bid over 2@C or 2@D ?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: this style has 0(zero) (zilch) appeal to e- what happens when pd has 5 clubs facing your Axxx - we can find out on the way back to the hotel|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Murray 2 sets to 1 and at the Oval.....|pg||
nt|odysseus69: break for Murray in 4th|pg||
nt|brolucius: All two-over-one players would have to respond 1NT and then make some bid or other in hearts.|pg||
nt|barnets: and if you cant make an invitational bid in hearts by jumping to 3@H then maybe you should make a direct invite|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dA|nt|roswolf: i think west was a bit lazy here|pg||
nt|eamongall: this one looks like an EW score so no hope there |pg||
nt|barnets: in the old days before 2/1 many would respond 2@h and then 3@H non forcing|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|eweber: good duck from East here|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, i think E overbid -- possibly for tactical reasons though|pg||
nt|eamongall: I am looking at any hope of austria getting through |pg||
nt|bernix: losing to monaco was the nail in the coffing|pg||
nt|eamongall: well austria have certainly done their best here ...currently standing at the maximum 25|pg||
nt|brolucius: You can take off a bit for the @DQ-x.|pg||
pc|c6|nt|tomi2:  interesting positions, I got 10 msg now with THE best line|pg||
nt|tomi2:  @HQ is a nice falsecard|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Brilliant|pg||
nt|tomi2:  makes GromÃ¶ller believe Lauria has the 3rd heart|pg||
nt|tomi2:  so @D pitches will not work|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Lauria knows where @DA is now|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ady: will make 12 tricks in spades as they lay|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: board 15 other tavle also in 6@H|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|Walddk2: Gromöller will think Lauria has the last trump|pg||
nt|odysseus69: dont think they play 2 over 1- didnt they stop in 2S earlier - after 1S - 2m-2H-2S|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|tomi2:  but would have Lauria played the @H9 from 984?|pg||
nt|brolucius: South knows that declarer has a void club, otherwise he would have led towards the @CK.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Would Versace have played a heart from Qxx?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He did|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So East be marked with @SA|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I confess that I don't see the rationale behind the double of 3@S here. The Russian EW pair have had several good boards, so they have no need to panic |pg||
nt|Walddk2: must be|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s7|nt|ftpe: what tactical reason?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|paulg:  when dummy goes down your first thought would be about making the contract, not two overtricks|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: Line for +1 is @cK finesse @cJ cash @CA and finesse @h9 - all abit risky|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|paulhac:  True|pg||
nt|eamongall: in case we did not mention it ... Sylvia and Franz Terraneo were the austrian NS |pg||
pc|d5|nt|jameslee 2: -1 |pg||
nt|brolucius: They don't play it, no.|pg||
pc|d6|nt|roswolf: lots of swings in this match|pg||

nt|hawe45:  Penultimate - does that mean, that they doÂ´nt play it...?|pg||
nt|athene: the auction in the other room is about how you would expect|pg||

nt|mcarroll: Unless defence set up a @C for declarer, they should come to 2@Hs and 2@Cs|pg||
nt|ftpe: after this lead down i think|pg||
nt|8252: encore une donne ou les distibutions ne sont pas urbaines|pg||

pc|dK|nt|ady: israel got 7 on board 14 in the thin 3NT    Ireland played a part score in hearts|pg||
nt|andreasw:  so 10 trick's|pg||
nt|xenya: but this is going to be a huge swing to Estonia|pg||
nt|me argent: la bonne nouvelle est K@S bien placer mais la mauvaise est la partage des atouts|pg||
nt|ritong: meme le grand talent de mari pourrait ne pas venir a bout de celle ci|pg||
nt|eamongall: those of us old enough might also remember a decent Austrian womens team in Euro champs 1991 in Killarney Ireland |pg||
nt|eamongall: they might have even won it but I reckon they definitely medaled|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|tomi2:  don't know where N found a raise to 6 here|pg||
nt|vasmar: probably she thougth that 4@s was a conservative approach|pg||
nt|shevek: can play @hQ now and claim|pg||
nt|bernix: they won it|pg||
nt|jaapfr: if in the endplay you lose 2@D and 2@C it is not really made so need some luck with @CQT|pg||

nt|petergill: they don't have it|pg||
nt|jaapfr: rite you are|pg||
nt|ralfwil: the @d lead was a killer|pg||
nt|petergill: after the hearts are stripped out, if she plays a club to the 8, EW have to be careful|pg||
nt|rmb1: In OR, defence did not play diamond early and were thrown in late.  But we weren't sure where the tenth trick came from|pg||
nt|petergill: then they have to win @CA, play low @D to W, low @d back to the king, then club|pg||
nt|jillan:  same here, 2 rounds of @S ruff the @H and exit in @D|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Why a killer? opened up the defence|pg||
nt|petergill: If @C6 or @C8, low, low, ducked by @CA, then declarer exits in @D to make |pg||

nt|brolucius: Yes, a brave lead. So easy to fish out a heart.|pg||
pc|d7|pg||

nt|xenya: spade was led in the OR i'm told|pg||
nt|xenya: W was declarer there|pg||
nt|ftpe: diffcult to lead ace di|pg||
nt|xenya: the @S lead by N looks normal enough, so i withdraw my criticism|pg||
nt|ftpe: withdraw accepted :)|pg||
nt|xenya: and it looks like another disaster for the Russian team is coming|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: well a valiant effort by austria - couldnt do more but apparently not enough so denmark + portugal get thru - finals start tomorrow|pg||
nt|eamongall: I recall the surname ... there was also Fischer ...like the chess players mane |pg||
nt|eamongall: name |pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: are you going to raise to "a lot"?|pg||
nt|paulg:  a kib suggests at least taking the ace of diamonds to cash five clubs first and then play a diamond ... which saves a trick|pg||
nt|haans: the delay after W bid is because SE are on other side of screen|pg||
nt|ftpe: more imps for estonia here, dont think he can manage|pg||
nt|tomi2:  Piekarek ruffed the 3rd @D with no thought to play a skade, now Sementa will get the @H right I think|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: dziêkujê licznym a znakomitym komentatorom oraz jeszcze bardziej licznym kibicom|pg||
nt|petergill: France has taken a 6 VP lead in the Women's event|pg||

nt|oleberg: (Unfortunate on this layout)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: what is S thinking of? or is it operator?|pg||
nt|oleberg: It might be West thinking|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I hope so:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|rigas_karo: last hand, good luck to both teams for rest of the tournament|pg||
nt|eweber: looking back all the big imps were won by style, board 8, 9, 14|pg||
nt|paulhac:  True|pg||
nt|tomi2:  now he committes himself to 4 level if pd has no @H fit?|pg||
nt|vasmar: for now Austria gets the lead after the unlucky slam of german|pg||
nt|psridhar: abt 25 % game i reckon ( dia 4-2 wih spd 2-2 also ok)|pg||
nt|oleberg: The oprator cannot use the keyboard before both screenmates have bid|pg||
nt|oleberg: That would give away the tempo|pg||
nt|barnets: England have played quite well this match|pg||
nt|mdgraham: horrible hand for EW to bid|pg||
pc|c2|nt|haans: 2nd opinion: Rado: 2@H weak 5+@H4+m 3@C pass or correct|pg||

nt|petergill: At the other table, the bidding might not have been as it is recorded|pg||
nt|jaapfr: tough decision for N|pg||
nt|petergill: 3NT has chances|pg||
nt|petergill: @D7 is the normal lead to 3NT |pg||
nt|jillan:  may even be easier to play the 4@S|pg||
nt|jaapfr: N considers a 4@C 4@H or pass bid |pg||
nt|jillan:  is west likely to find a heart lead?|pg||
nt|petergill: Other table : 1@D showed hearts and 1@H was takeout of hearts|pg||
nt|petergill: No chance of a @h lead to 3NT - East showed 6 @d's, did not show hearts|pg||
nt|odysseus69: quiet board to finish|pg||
nt|barnets: and it will be a close result|pg||
nt|odysseus69: have to leave- bye all|pg||

nt|oleberg: It helps him, that he is limited to 15 points, partner will know the nature of his hand|pg||
pc|cA|nt|pitiful:  doubled was the stripe tailed ape|pg||
nt|mamos: wow  was that striped ape do you think|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: thx to our commentators eamonn, justin, bernard - vugraph operator and hope to see you all tomorrow for the finals round 1|pg||
nt|jillan:  so this might make then :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4@C the lesser bid so pass or 4@H|pg||
nt|petergill: West (likely) or East (unlikely) will need to find a heart switch, if East puts up @DK on a low @d elad|pg||
nt|barnets: bye victor|pg||
nt|brolucius: So have the Italians at this table. There was that diamond lead against 3NT and the 7@D that they bid. |pg||
nt|bagman: bye|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|lmeili: never argue with DR Waldow :)|pg||
nt|reisig: disaster coming|pg||
nt|haans: dont ask|pg||
nt|vasmar: S is happy to pass|pg||
nt|roswolf: east will pass?he is normally very reluctant to pass an invitation|pg||
nt|mcarroll: on 19 4@S was made in Open, to account for most of the lead held by Bulgaria|pg||
nt|pitiful:  or at least he will claim that later|pg||
nt|jaapfr: @H|pg||
pc|d4|nt|cumino: sry|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: @s @h @d @c last hand  Bye from Ostend @c @d @h @s|pg||
nt|iyer7550: looks like norway will score a moral victory|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: dobrze, ¿e tu sêdziowie nie musz¹ uznawaæ strzelonych goli |pg||
nt|jkotor: bez pasa Adama po 1@h-2@h-? te¿ mo¿na graæ transferami|pg||
nt|jkotor: 2@s = GF z fitem, 2ba=@c, 3@c=@d, 3@d=INV z fitem, 3@h=przepych|pg||
nt|petergill: Might be hard (impossible) to put @DK on 1D!0 = unlucky|pg||
nt|oleberg: 5NT = Pick a slam (I sincerely hope)|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mamos: lol|pg||
nt|MolvaM: many thanks to all our commentators and our specs for their valuable guidance|pg||
nt|haans: 3@S must have been premptive|pg||
nt|marlowepi: je m'etonne a la ligne de jeu, notamment le deuxieme tour d'atout avant de jouer trefle et coeur pour limiter la note si les atouts sont mal partages|pg||
pc|dA|nt|andersk: calm finish, so the results as it stands now, is 15-15 in VP|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Its Stayman Jim, but not as we know it?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a @h lead was Killing|pg||
nt|jaapfr: duck??|pg||
nt|petergill: @D5 = discouraging, as South is "marked' with @DAQJ|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|ady: might be 1 too high    depends on view in trumps|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: very much so 0-6  4 card is the maximum preempitve |pg||
nt|psridhar: but that 3s worked in pushing Freding into the startosphere 4D|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|tomi2:  trump lead|pg||
nt|lechcold: wygl¹da ¿e mo¿emy Holendrom odpisaæ jeszcze kilka VP|pg||
nt|petergill: This swing will halve the margin|pg||
nt|oleberg: Payback for board 14, where Iceland in open room bid and made a very lucky 6@S|pg||
nt|ralfwil: W will make this, so thanks all and I wish you all a nice Wednesday evening:)|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|xenya: N doubled on slender values but 4-4-4-1, and S was happy to pass|pg||
pc|d7|nt|eweber: if I weren't an aggressive bidder I would consider to convert after watching this match :)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  i would like to back to board 4 and 11 tricks was made!!!!!:)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: thanks andreas, nicoleta|pg||
nt|chick: This is the last board for this table,  3 yet to score|pg||
nt|mdgraham: maybe West could rebid 1NT, but personally I loathe it - any preferences? 2@d seems normal enough |pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|pitiful:  great hand to finish with|pg||
nt|pitiful:  well done to the dutch, they played very well|pg||
nt|pitiful:  after a slow start they are motoring |pg||
nt|mamos: the idea is you double 5 Level to stop them bidding Six then if they redouble you vanish to your save like a stripe tailed ape vanishing up a tree|pg||
nt|aldek: anyhow, great entertainment|pg||
nt|pitiful:  thanks to all watching|pg||
nt|pitiful:  bye now|pg||
nt|mamos: yes thsanks all|pg||
nt|aldek: till next time|pg||
nt|nyg8:  5HX was striptail monkey - i.e. stop then from gettnig to 6|pg||
nt|psridhar: bd 19 Sweden did reach their 'game'|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: both match are no time penalty 3 minutes left |pg||

nt|oleberg: And a nice vening to you and everybody else|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: thanks all...|pg||
nt|maribelxx: another reason for the day being quiet is midsummer... all shops are closed, no public transport, people flee from cities to spend a few days in the country|pg||
nt|chick: Thanks to our excellent vugraph operator,  Michel Machiels, for a great job!!  :)|pg||
nt|jkotor: po pasie uzna³, ¿e ka¿da licytacja MUSI byæ z fitem|pg||
nt|ritong: il faudrait verifier si une ligne de jeu " méfiante" ne risque pas le contrat en cas de partages normaux|pg||
nt|marlowepi: il y avait une probabilite miniscule que N ait 5 coeurs (crainte de promotion d'atout), car il avait passe en troisieme aux couleurs favorables et il a deja le roi de pique en ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: plaus de ses coeurs--au moins|pg||
nt|ritong: bien  allons voir ce qui se passe dans l autre salle|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|rnmalik: good bridge, 20 boards and such little difference.|pg||
nt|paulhac:  North might well have bid over 2@H|pg||
nt|ady: good guess|pg||
nt|maribelxx: sorry :(|pg||
nt|santyclz: Thanks all, see you soon.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: ok andreas we analyze that board and send you the results by a sealed envelope|pg||
nt|tomi2:  not difficult after Piekarek has told him his exact shape...|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i would at least think a longer time as E to see how this can go down on trick 1|pg||
nt|odysseus69: looks normal auction|pg||
pc|s4|nt|haans: 9.30 central time tomorrow|pg||
nt|shevek: thx Murat, Andreas, everyone|pg||

nt|andreasw:  bye everyone|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: other table playing 2nt west |pg||
nt|brolucius: If the @DK lead picks up a big number we will have a near-draw, very creditable. |pg||
nt|barnets: for those interested in extraordinary bridge stories , scandal and hands I have anew wbsite at www.shenkinbridge.com and a club free to join|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|eweber: this is the last board on this table, but we will have the chance to watch the last 5 in the open|pg||
nt|psridhar: that 2nt wont be a success either|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s7|pc|h2|pc|s8|pg||
nt|Gerben42: thanks to our excellent operator in Oostende in Belgium!|pg||
nt|ady: now can set up 4th club to discard a diamond|pg||
nt|mcarroll: This convention (Rado) seems to have many names, we call it both Tartan and Pender and I believe it has other names|pg||
nt|psridhar: the hand belongs to NS in spds|pg||
nt|brolucius: Thanks for watching!|pg||
nt|othered1: Thanks everyone and bye for now.|pg||
nt|barnets: where do they stand ?|pg||

nt|bagman: thx all|pg||
nt|barnets: bye all|pg||
nt|brolucius: Thanks for watching!|pg||
pc|s3|nt|paulhac:  But with soft values and a singleton I can see why he passed|pg||
nt|ady: now no need|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: a @d there might have beaten it with a @C return ...|pg||
pc|sT|nt|paulg:  i'm surprised that 1@s was not opened in the other room|pg||
nt|motu: maybe only 800|pg||
nt|petergill: West needs to switch to hearts, not play 1D's and partner did discourage 1d's  - can she read @D5 as high discouraging?|pg||
nt|jillan:  Brownis doing good discarding all her @D|pg||
nt|petergill: 1D  and 1d = @ds|pg||
nt|petergill: Yes, telling aprtnet to play 1Hs not 1|pg||
nt|petergill: @D's|pg||
pc|d9|pg||

nt|paulg:  Thanks all, more matches in 55 minutes time|pg||
nt|iyer7550: for those kibitzers who are not aware of the difficulties the vugraph operator experiences let me tell you, it is a very tough job. |pg||
nt|eamongall: I feel sad ... what am I going to do for a buzz tomorrow |pg||

nt|babs59: bye all|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|iyer7550: to keep pace with the players is really very difficult. |pg||
nt|ryskiel_: Panie 16-14 ze Szkocj¹|pg||
nt|petergill: They play Reverse Odd Even Discards|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|eamongall: So as far as I see it .... I need another team ... going to stick with the old favourites Italy |pg||
nt|eamongall: and maybe netherlands |pg||
nt|bernix: italy for me as well|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lechcold: brawo|pg||

nt|jkmjanusz: Holendrzy zawiedli na ca³ej linii; Aldek: dlaczego?|pg||
nt|lechcold: do zobaczenia|pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: Przekupi³e?|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: seniorzy 19-11 z Wali¹|pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: Dio widzenia!|pg||
nt|aldek: nie powinni byli wystawiac mlodych na Adama i Cezarego|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: Holendrzy sa nieprzekupni|pg||
nt|jkotor: ale mo¿e starsi te¿ na nich nie chcieli siadaæ?|pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: Ale to Paulissen przegra³ 6@C!|pg||

nt|jkmjanusz: Narkioewicz skotrowal, 5@H|pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: 4@H - i zniesli na 5@D...|pg||
nt|bogier: widocznie nie wie co to "cichy pogrzeb"|pg||
nt|vdoubleu: anyway am outta here--park--looking forward to Wed Raph:)))))|pg||
nt|eamongall: I guess its back to watching Great Mulall versus the Gibs ... current score is minus 550 imps after 411 boards |pg||
nt|eamongall: hey I am informed I can support the Wales who are likely to qualify |pg||
nt|eamongall: lets examine that |pg||
nt|bernix: austrias senior team still in hunt for 6th place|pg||
nt|eamongall: they must have won the tiebreak or direct match or whatever way they split it |pg||
nt|eamongall: with the last board they overtook Croatia who have beaten Italy 25:5... Sementa will be happy to see that score gone |pg||
nt|eamongall: but ...Wales lost to Latvia so what gives |pg||
nt|petergill: partner|pg||
pc|c7|nt|xenya: if he gets out for -1 however, the swing won't be that big -- just 5 imps|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|vasmar: 1 off|pg||
nt|vasmar: 3 imps for Germany in board 18 since 1NT was 3 off in open room|pg||
nt|petergill: even pip = discouraging|pg||
nt|jillan:  I know dear, just tried to make 2 jokes.... sepll and aprtnet :) |pg||
pc|cK|nt|ady: can try for a club spade squeeze   but dows not work|pg||
nt|roswolf: ideed|pg||
nt|psridhar: thx all bye|pg||
nt|jaapfr: after a lot of changing sensations a push to end the session|pg||
pc|d3|nt|rnmalik: This is the last board, thanks all.|pg||
nt|andersk: cya|pg||
nt|petergill: sorry, even pip - encouraging, so Fiona discarded @D3 |pg||
pc|c8|pc|cJ|pg||
nt|roswolf: 9 tricks|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|xenya: sorry, 7 |pg||
pc|s6|nt|ralfwil: ????|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but will W be clear enough:)?|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ady: Israel well ahead at the moment   but hands 16 and 18 could be large swings for Ireland|pg||
nt|chick: definitely!   the operators have the hardest job of all in the vugraph|pg||
nt|jillan:  why claim now?|pg||
nt|petergill: Hugh McGann has convinced Fioan to play Reverse Odd Even Discard and Reverse Suit Pref, so Susan plays that with Fiona, though Hugh's partner Tom prefers not to play these card ...|pg||
nt|petergill: play methods! |pg||
nt|jaapfr: we missed @CK x@D aftr @HJ|pg||
nt|petergill: West had all winners at the end|pg||
nt|jillan:  sometimes I think they claim prematurely|pg||
nt|jaapfr: bye all and tx|pg||
nt|petergill: Even if declarer had avoided the early club finesse and simply played spades, West would have been squeezed then endplayed in the ending|pg||
nt|jillan:  so see ya all!|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Thanks all and bye|pg||
nt|petergill: for Results go to http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/10Ostend/Results.htm|pg||
nt|petergill: then click on the word Women's in Black Type|pg||
pc|h6|pg||

mc|6|nt|vasmar: and the expected 11 imps in board 19 for Germany|pg||
nt|vasmar: Thx all|pg||
