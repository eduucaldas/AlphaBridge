nt|hedyg: and Roland :) good morning Roland|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hello everyone, good morning from a very hot London|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Hey Roland lol|pg||
nt|brolucius: The Bocchi-Madala 1@C is natural, 11-21 points but may be based on as few as two clubs.|pg||
nt|stc: zürich is hot too|pg||
nt|andyv:  good morning everyone|pg||
nt|koksoy: is  there a misunderstanding ?  2nt is @H and @D  ??|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Hey Andy, Barbara|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Barbara|pg||
nt|drorp: I think W bid 1@S?|pg||
nt|athene: hello good afternoon everyone|pg||
nt|rnmalik: likely 4@S and @S lead would beat it.|pg||
nt|haans: can be suicide now|pg||
nt|peachy: 2NT response was apparently relay to 3C|pg||
nt|haans: had they had a little talk?|pg||
nt|haans: Barel can see its take-out|pg||
nt|haans: NS have 16 hcp were is @SQ?|pg||
nt|peachy: If opener was forced to bid 3C, Tsonchev still doesn't know anything about opener's hand, but probably doesn';t matter, he can see 3C is reasonable|pg||
nt|mgchat: allez on "pousse" tous pour eux|pg||

nt|brolucius: I wonder if South's pass of 1@C will eventually allow declarer to drop the @SK offside.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: hello Peter, Gerben, Ugis and Barnet|pg||
nt|ugis: Latvians playing Precision here and Polish club in the other room|pg||
nt|petergill: An untidy contract to reach|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 2@C must have been some art. rebid|pg||
nt|gulyas: this a good day so far for Hungary, scoring 29 and trying to climb back to contention|pg||

mb|p|nt|paulg:  Wilkinson-Piper play a fairly standard version of Precision, in a typically aggressive style|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Hello everyone|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: Yes, set and ready to go|pg||
nt|mamos: good afternoon from England|pg||
nt|barnets: hi all|pg||
nt|ugis: yes, 2c artificial here|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Welcome Barnet :)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: so looks like a Burn's law violation|pg||
nt|Gerben42: (opps have more trumps than declarer)|pg||
nt|petergill: NS Convention Card is http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/May/OpenTeams/latvia/Ozols-Romanovskis.pdf|pg||
nt|Gerben42: probably not much lost as natural bidders would reach 3@C, which has problems on this trump break|pg||
nt|milton_se: NS play a natural 5542 system and EW a strong club with lots of relay sequences|pg||
nt|toral5: hello othered and graham:)|pg||
nt|tokay1975: hi|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  dbl here by W should deny 4 spades. so E might be better to bid the @d suit|pg||
nt|xenya: and Martin |pg||
nt|bagman: Here NS are lucky to make 4@H|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Hey Mike, Shirley :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: canape sequesnce it seems |pg||
nt|mamos: yes ew stong club canape |pg||
nt|mamos: english pair 4 card majors natural style|pg||
nt|iain sime: Hi everyone. Both pairs are using fairly natural methods. For Italy 2@Dis strong, for the Swiss it is a weak 2.|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: As is Ostend :) Hey Iain|pg||
nt|hedyg: Polish @c for EW|pg||
nt|gulyas: a win here may still help them get in the top9|pg||
nt|athene: standard for NS|pg||
nt|athene: (strong and 5)|pg||
nt|gulyas: EW plays polish club|pg||
nt|bagman: Looks like strong club opening and two suited 2NT or misunderstanding|pg||
nt|koksoy: it  may be  lead directing purpose..|pg||
nt|schtsch: tesla stanicic are not in good shape on this tournament, but now is the time to correct it|pg||
nt|frululu: good result for Croatia in open room|pg||
nt|schtsch: well, we need 25 in this match to have a chance :)|pg||
nt|corplaw: EW can make 4H so possible double game swing available|pg||
nt|schtsch: so this is necessary|pg||
nt|frululu: and Latvia,Hungary and Wales need to be hitted by a bus :P|pg||
nt|drorp: 4@S makeable, needs good guessing though.|pg||
nt|athene: just two diamonds and a spade to lose hre|pg||
nt|toral5: hi tokay|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Slightly pushy game, but preempt improves it.|pg||
nt|ziff:  I met him a couple of years ago at an EBL TD course|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: greetings everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and zz|pg||
nt|yuval10: 4@h next door|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: Heya Mike, Bill|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: And Roland :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: we are set |pg||
nt|Walddk2: And hello to Bas too|pg||
nt|bagman: or actually 5@H|pg||
nt|lesniak: witam wszystkich|pg||
nt|ugis: 2h showed h+c, min, S has forgotten the system :)|pg||
nt|athene: both pairs upside down carding|pg||
nt|petergill: A quiet hand to start|pg||
nt|xenya: 4@D makes sense opposite a passed partner|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A = 3  K = 2  Q = 1|pg||
pc|dT|nt|bjacobs: This will be a stern test for Lithuania ... no joy on board 1, although 4@H is a fairly normal contract|pg||
nt|sybarra: everything off side here,  |pg||
nt|rnmalik: anyways de Wijs opted not to bid a misfit.|pg||
nt|jkotor: .|pg||
nt|athene: here|pg||
nt|barnets: and in fact 4@D was chosen in both rooms a good choice|pg||
nt|barnets: 5@D usually forces opps to x |pg||
nt|Walddk2: It will be there soon|pg||
nt|athene: yes, pre-empts of 4@S and above tend to force opponents to do the right thing; i.e. defend|pg||
pc|dA|nt|xenya: @Hs rightsided|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Hey all, welcome back :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hello Pekka and Ben|pg||
nt|bagman: North has a very unfitting hand for South. 3NT might have made but the bad diamond break probably kills even that|pg||
nt|pasker: Hi everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and Andy|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Heya Ben|pg||
nt|brolucius: The 2@C overcall has helped them to stop low on good values.|pg||
nt|iain sime: Even hot in Edinburgh!|pg||
nt|brolucius: 12 winners (a requirement for a slam) but 2 losers (a negative slam feature).|pg||
nt|ni hao: salut|pg||

nt|Walddk2: You forgot to add the seniors, Bas. Here is the complete new macro|pg||

pc|dQ|pg||
nt|atabey: even w/o preemt normal to reach|pg||
nt|fabsayc: a fair bit of upgrading, this should make|pg||
nt|bagman: North would like to cash a spade and return a trump|pg||
nt|andyv:  some work to do here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hi Roland|pg||
nt|drorp: Very aggressive bidding from Versace, but the layout is lucky, will need to guess the spade situation to make.|pg||
nt|haans: not best game ever|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Barel now asking what passing his X of 2NT would've been|pg||
nt|peachy: Barel thiks like I do, I would have liked to know that as well|pg||
nt|haans: OR 4@H down|pg||
nt|yvesj49: une donne pour lancer la partie|pg||
nt|besbes: c est la paire suedoise la plus serieuse ds l autre salle les artistes |pg||
nt|ritong: salut michel|pg||
pc|d4|nt|andyv:  should be an easy down 2|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 9 tricks in @S for EW because of good @S and @D splits, I think|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Bas:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  but 4th @d should allow declarer to pitch a @s|pg||
nt|athene: he will know the @SA is with north|pg||
nt|athene: for the opening bid|pg||
nt|lechcold: dzieñ dobry|pg||
nt|jkotor: Witam Pañstwa|pg||
pc|dK|nt|kiwi_joker: yes, but not a contract that was ever likley to be doubled|pg||
nt|andyv:  1st board partials tend to get away with murder... no one is ready to commit 11 or more imps:)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Italians must play that 3@D is weaker than a pass on the East cards.|pg||
nt|mamos: The English pair very experienced of course  - winners in Worls Seniors|pg||
nt|sybarra: nice lead to take the entry out of dummy fast |pg||
nt|barnets: e/w do quite well in diamonds|pg||
nt|barnets: 4@D often allows theopps to amke a mistake|pg||
pc|d3|nt|xenya: played by S. it goes down on a @D lead|pg||
nt|sharkey: Will need to drop @SK to make|pg||
nt|bagman: South should IMO raised to 3@C instead of the 2nd pass|pg||
nt|lesniak: liczymy na lepszy wystep naszych|pg||
nt|bagman: Without X, this might be relatively cheap|pg||
nt|andyv:  the Italians are so good, they merely sent East and West to play for them.|pg||
nt|andyv:  not a bad pair here either|pg||
nt|corplaw: needs to avoid spade lead|pg||
nt|tokay1975: this one probably they will play 6nt  but maybe dangerous to find dia fit |pg||

pc|h9|pg||
nt|antoniz: bilans sto³u zosta³ zgubiony,trudno|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Roland, Pekka, Ben and everyone:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  and anti-percentage slam to start with|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Hey Andy|pg||
nt|pasker: Yes always relieving to see game going down as well if you are not doubled|pg||
nt|schtsch: ok, this is a plus score|pg||
nt|schtsch: but let's see how much|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hello Gary and Venky|pg||
nt|athene: but he might play north for @SAQx perhaps|pg||
nt|tokay1975: there is no sp  to ruff  dummy|pg||
nt|haans: Not @DK all card down|pg||
nt|peachy: Israel takes the first imps in this match, without a mishap on declarer's part, this contract is cold|pg||
pc|sA|nt|henryb:  It looks like declarer should take 2@s, 1@h, and two in each minor|pg||
nt|paulg:  Wilkinson-Piper also play very fast, so this should be a quick set|pg||

mb|4D|nt|rodvenn: yes. Boye transferred first to spades and then bid hearts|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/10Ostend/Ostend|pg||
nt|bjacobs: In fact, 6@C on this layout will make on a heart lead!|pg||

nt|capercliff: Bas, tell him they are down by 3 goals already!:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Better to not go than to go like the French|pg||

nt|bagman: I used to play Romex in 1981, then the opening was called Mexican 2@D (bal about this strength)|pg||
nt|stc: and, once ops are fixed on @s, 3NT is an easy make|pg||
nt|brolucius: West should have every reason to be nervous about this auction - having not shown his values at all.|pg||
nt|hedyg: how many times can you pass with 10 hcps opposite an opening?|pg||
nt|iain sime: 3NT would have made in practice.|pg||
nt|Gerben42: both hands 4333... should be in 3N|pg||
nt|athene: now a quiet 3@D from north - no interest in big things facing a passed hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  EW able to bully NS out of this auction.|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Heya Mike|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I think 2NT is either 7-9 HCP with 4@H or 10-11 with 3@H|pg||

nt|athene: this was always a danger - now on a club lead east will just duck to maintain communications|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Board 1 will be flat|pg||
nt|yuval10: a swing here|pg||
nt|viren169: Not sure I like 3@D with Txxx|pg||
nt|mgchat: les notres ont joués 3SA ;(;(|pg||

mb|p|nt|jtr: 2@s shwoing a minimum hand with @ss and @cs|pg||
nt|jtr: showing|pg||
nt|boz_: ala fantunes|pg||
nt|petergill: The play of 3@DX corrected to 3@HX is hard to analyse, if South went for blood|pg||
nt|schtsch: ah 3@c is some sort of relay it seems|pg||
nt|rv: I would X 3@D as game try if @DA was elsewhere|pg||
nt|barnets: a club lead defeats this|pg||
nt|athene: and declarer has nowhere to go, other than hoping for 4-4 clubs|pg||
nt|jillan:  They bid 7@D at the ither table so no swing|pg||
nt|yuval10: quite tough to see NS making their contract|pg||
nt|haans: not good odds|pg||
nt|peachy: just needs to find CQ|pg||
mb|6D|nt|xenya: good stop, good lead|pg||
nt|bagman: E has soft values but he has so much of them that he has to at least invite|pg||
nt|brolucius: A recent book recommended a 5-4-3-2-1 point count (5 for aces, 1 for tens) when responding to 1NT. That would upgrade the value of the East hand.|pg||
nt|hedyg: no they dont open 1NT with 5 card majors|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I can't hear what they're saying exactly, but it's not Puppet I believe|pg||
nt|hedyg: i think 2@d denies 3 + cards in @H|pg||
nt|bagman: West has a good hand: aces and kings and the only Q in the suit where it surely works|pg||
nt|antoniz: kontra w 2pik powinna pokazywaæ lepsz¹ rêkê,moim zdaniem|pg||
nt|gulyas: EW lead 2nd/4th|pg||
nt|athene: can't see declarer finessing the six of trumps so this will lose two clubs, three trumps...maybe he will finesse spades too for a heart pitch|pg||
nt|athene: unless east gets endplayed somehow|pg||
nt|wstuart: probably shows any min?|pg||
nt|athene: i guess versace can anticipate that south will be able to hold up a diamond card and just kill the dummy|pg||
nt|mgchat: Chemla a dit 1@d 3@d en reponse ?|pg||
nt|yvesj49: bon|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: NS play 4 card majors|pg||
nt|marlowepi: presumably will rise and play a spade|pg||
nt|hedyg: or he will ruff out Q@s maybe?|pg||
nt|andyv:  should make this|pg||
nt|peachy: or not give trick to it, rather|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: Looks like 9 tricks or so with the lie of the cards|pg||
nt|atabey: zorlu will have to guess @hs|pg||
nt|othered1: Personally, I'm not big on semi-psychic openings and would prefer to have some defense if I open.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Or "can" make|pg||
nt|mbruun: Good save by the Italians. East unstopable after the thin overcall|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Anyway, 5@S doubled is a pretty normal outcome|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Esp with @S, the Italians like to come in at the 1 level|pg||
nt|mdgraham: EW basically natural with a srong NT. NS play the NASZ system|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i predict down one|pg||
nt|corplaw: 4H could be down if declarer misguesses everything and def gives no help|pg||
nt|haans: yep but @CQ-third at wrong hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: However, 8 might not be so easy:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: but nothing in their CC|pg||
nt|bagman: About 25 yars later it has been resurrected|pg||
nt|lesniak: oczywiscie jego istotnoæ polega na tym ,¿e wynik tego meczu bedzie sie liczy w finale|pg||
nt|bagman: The heart guess is getting no easier|pg||
nt|bagman: because S needs @HA for his opening more or less|pg||
nt|viren169: Trump lead usually works better on this type of auction|pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: finesse must be better odds surely|pg||
nt|hedyg: a 3rd seat minor preempt is not necessarily weak|pg||
nt|athene: trump switch now would not help the defence, of course|pg||
nt|ziff:  I suspect 2@C was an artificial gameforce, 2@D may be balanced or nor @H support|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@C likely a general GF, perhaps 2@D = not three hearts. Just guessing though|pg||
nt|petergill: EW quickly established that slam was poor. The 2@D response to 2@C looks like it showed a minimum hand |pg||
nt|ziff:  Great minds all think alike ;)|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@C asked, 2@D = not 3@H, 2@S GF natural, 2NT minimum balanced, 4@S = end|pg||
nt|petergill: from my Italian source|pg||
nt|jkotor: bardzo dobry wynik naszych w Pok Otw|pg||

pc|s3|nt|sybarra: bid 1 looks like severe punishment |pg||
nt|hedyg: so he either has 4@ss or no major|pg||
nt|petergill: The bidding makes picking the @D's fairly easy|pg||
nt|andyv:  don't see how... 5@hs, 2@s and at least 1@c|pg||
nt|schtsch: don't think 3@c can be minimum|pg||
nt|schtsch: how do they play 3@h then?|pg||
nt|schtsch: 3@h is obviously minimum, 3@c some relayish|pg||
nt|ahri: 3@c could ask which option it is if 2NT is what Bas suggests. I'll take a peek in their CC.|pg||
nt|peachy: I think after this lead he will be defaulted into the line that lets it male|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Good morning to David Bird|pg||
nt|brolucius: Hi to the kibitzers!|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: Heya David B :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: The proposed new point-count system had two big flaws, as I see it. (1) No-one wants to have a 60-point deck and to need 34 points to open 2@C. Too difficult to count that high. ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: Also, you don;t know whether you will end in NT during the early bidding, so impractical to upgrade the Q/Js, which will have less value in an eventual suit contract.  |pg||

pc|s7|pc|sQ|nt|atabey: not anymore|pg||
nt|sybarra: little frisky agst the Italians in the other room maybe|pg||
nt|athene: that's interesting shot - playing his partner for the ace of spades, hoping for @SA and another, and now declarer would duck, fearing the switch was a singleton|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 3@h shows a stiff @D|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3@D+2@S=5 I can only see 5 tricks for the defense. 2@S also when @H is played by E after 3 rounds of @D. The key card is the Q@C.|pg||
nt|athene: let's see if they find 4@S in the other room|pg||

nt|ppiglett: The Croatians sadly missed out on a split tie to Latvia to the Italian delight. They are all very strong competitors and were audiby releived that their score against Croatia ...|pg||
nt|ppiglett: didn't have to carry |pg||

nt|mdgraham: well, 4@H was mildly unlucky|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I like the 2@C overcall, but West's raise to 3@C was more dubious.  Whatever, the Italians had booked a gain by stopping in a partscore|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but there is a question of whether 2@H in the actual sequence is (a) sign-off (b) invitational (c) forcing|pg||
nt|barnets: it would certainly have been more interesting to watch peter|pg||
nt|Gerben42: not so clear at this vuln to prefer defending|pg||
nt|april7: at least 2 down  because most cards  wrong positioned|pg||
nt|viren169: Looks like 1st blood to England...|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|bagman: Assuming that declarer guesses the spade layout|pg||
nt|bagman: Which he really should even with the restricted choice|pg||
nt|peachy: still, very tough, and I expect he goes down|pg||
pc|s8|nt|jtr: problems|pg||
nt|marlowepi: dont understand the second trump, but maybe i am not awake yet|pg||
nt|wstuart: Somewhat pointless to guess at their methods.|pg||
nt|april7: now @S switch|pg||
nt|toral5: nice undershift|pg||
nt|tokay1975: this is 1 down but very good for italy  that  5h also  down adn 4sp making|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Are our commentators on strike? You got a pay rise last month|pg||
nt|toral5: again an imp at stake seeing the other room result.|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: lol Roland|pg||
pc|s4|nt|marlowepi: had trumps been 4-1 the second heart would have ben fatal, but there would have been chances by leading a spade|pg||
nt|brolucius: Possible intra-finesse in clubs.|pg||
nt|gulyas: it was not a bad idea, it was just wrong here|pg||
nt|athene: ok, one down|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer is likely to draw trumps now|pg||
nt|yuval10: he does|pg||
pc|dT|nt|bjacobs: Most would play (a) ... but North might raise anyway.  The 4@H bid seemed to be "a lot"|pg||
nt|robinswr: strange that north is not playing on clubs|pg||
nt|toral5: will make only 2 now|pg||
nt|yvesj49: genre bicolore majeur faible|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, some ******* has stolen my address book and is sending adverts that seem to come from me.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: for example, you can play 2@H as invitational and 2@C as a puppet to 2@d, so that 2@H is then pass/correct |pg||
nt|marlowepi: probably N judged that if trumps were 4-1 E would not have led a singleton|pg||
nt|petergill: True|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes your right, can score all the trumps|pg||
pc|dA|nt|lechcold: przy asie trefl nie ma atuta - bêdzie swoje|pg||

pc|d6|nt|lesniak: celne zachowanie gracza E|pg||

pc|s9|nt|iain sime: As it happens 5@D loses two clubs and a heart. |pg||
nt|brolucius: But he very reasonably played the overcaller for the @CK.|pg||

nt|andyv:  I don't believe it's weak:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: That's what I thought, Fayad explained it as weak though|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Anyway the awkward preempted sequence has placed them in a Moysian where the split is frtiendly|pg||
nt|mbruun: Declarer lacks entries for the double hook in diamonds, så with this fortunate lay-out, 12 tricks are possible. 4 H as the Italians reached is a decent spot as well|pg||
nt|hedyg: that might have worked|pg||
nt|lesniak: E powinien wznowic- ale widac ze sie boj¹ naszej pary|pg||

nt|daman: Hi Billand Roland|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: I'd bid 2@S, 0-4 6+@S|pg||
nt|othered1: I couldn't resist bidding on east's hand.  NS (obviously) don't promise great @S length for their takeout doubles|pg||
nt|peachy: E will decline, but it would have not cost anything to try|pg||
mb|3N|nt|capercliff: acurate defence is down 2 i think?|pg||
nt|pasker: looks like they will be playing slam now|pg||
nt|bagman: Against Irish slam Versace would know what to do|pg||
nt|andyv:  Versace not one to be timid on leads|pg||
nt|pasker: Looks pretty tough to lead a @C from Versace's hand|pg||
nt|bagman: "First you cash your aces and kings, then you cash your partner's aces and kings and the you wait for two trump tricks"|pg||
nt|andyv:  Goran style?|pg||
nt|bagman: The club lead can be very very wrong |pg||
nt|bagman: if the slam is bid on marginal tricks|pg||
nt|hedyg: still seem to be playing puppet though|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 3M after 3@C must be something else then :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: i dont understand why you would play puppet when 2@d denies 5M|pg||
nt|andyv:  hard to avoid 2@s and 2@h losers|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: witamy Krzysztofa Martensa|pg||
nt|bagman: N is worried that the @SK is wrong|pg||
nt|athene: 1@D is a bit less likely to be short than 1@C|pg||

nt|toral5: this means they stopped wel looking at the cards and lot of hcps|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Great decision by Lauria. |pg||
nt|rhelle: and that is with the @sJ dropping and the minors splitting 3-3|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  he can be very passive|pg||

nt|milton_se: certainly not|pg||

nt|haans: splinters pay as well lead directing|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: Shabby trumps, unlikely to guess the layout|pg||
nt|hedyg: can we switch to 6@c now?|pg||
nt|bagman: because of the overcall|pg||
nt|bagman: and the ruff coming anyhow|pg||
nt|brolucius: Now it is no good to guess the @HA-x because West would get a club ruff.|pg||
nt|bagman: He should play for drop, because he might still have chance to set up diamonds with Qxx hearts and xxx diamonds in the same hand|pg||

pc|dA|nt|pasker: Declarer likely to play for trumps 2-2 as has an extra chance if 3-1 of setting up @Ds for a 2nd @C pitch|pg||

nt|drorp: maybe some sort of trump coup possible, double dummy i think even 10 tricks are possible|pg||
nt|athene: this is a common dilemma for the defence - if you play trumps, declarer uses a side suit|pg||

nt|sybarra: sounds like a volley ball game description |pg||
nt|bjacobs: Duboin really has a serious problem here - if that queen is singleton, which the odds suggest, he needs to cross to dummy to finesse diamonds|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I think I'll settle for the ECATS system document: available from http://www.ecatsbridge.com/Events/ebl/2010ostend/default.asp|pg||
nt|bjacobs: As it turns out, even if he does that, he will make, because then the 3-3 club break is revealed|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not every day i see someone say "the finesse is the more elegant line of play"|pg||

nt|athene: when he switches to a heart, will declarer decide the @HK is wrong, and try to ruff it down?|pg||
nt|athene: ok, maybe he is considering a trump|pg||

nt|koksoy: at  board 2 Wales are one level higher than Italians so 4 imps to  Ýtaly|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|brolucius: Some players use 2@S and 2NT to differentiate between a 3-card and 4-card heart raise. That would help declarer on this deal because he could then visualize two possible trump ...|pg||

nt|athene: but hard to know that really from south's point of view|pg||

nt|mdgraham: The Lithuanians let 5@D play on board 2 - likely afraid of pushing NS into a making slam - but 11 more to Italy |pg||

nt|mamos: ACTION|pg||
nt|brolucius: I see that it means that when responder continues with 2@S over the requested 2@H, this has a special meaning. (Some players use that as Baron, looking for a 4-4 minor-suit fit).|pg||

nt|april7: good defence holding NS to 8 tricks|pg||

nt|athene: 2@S gives east a slightly awkward decision|pg||
nt|athene: 3@H is very committal on such a modest suit|pg||

nt|Walddk2: I think it's a terrible Michaels vulnerable|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Shirley, one of the very top players in my area agrees with you.  He thinks the only excuse for not coming in with a 5-5 is that you are dead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I have a mild aversion to going for unnecessary 1400 penalties|pg||

mb|1N|nt|bjacobs: well, it's only mild ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 500 point save in 5@S|pg||
nt|bagman: NS have started by bidding quite aggressively. It's a reasonable strategy when being an underdog|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@C Precision|pg||
nt|snetram:  Holandia, Austria i Anglia|pg||
nt|drorp: Ultra agressive opening|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: bidding 3@H would be aiming at a very small target|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D alerted because it promises some values|pg||
nt|athene: (2nt would be rubbish)|pg||
nt|daman: he might try 3@H now|pg||
nt|athene: i think east should just pass|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not really worth it|pg||
nt|brolucius: Had West made a weak jump overcall of 2@S and the opponents then settled in 6@C, declarer might play East for the @HA.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Perhaps Slovakians were up all night celebrating.|pg||
nt|bagman: North has some options: 2@D, 2NT, 3@C and 3NT|pg||

nt|rv: pass by West denies 3@s, negative inference for no support X|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: wow Italy not only bid slam but grand on board 1 and made it|pg||
nt|athene: that was a difficult cash-out situation for the defence, last board|pg||
nt|athene: there were layouts where they had to take the trump off dummy and cash a third spade|pg||
nt|rhelle: surely 4@s now?|pg||
nt|othered1: 2@C opening doesn't make it easy, but NS will find their way.  North's shape ensures that.|pg||
nt|idc: Hi Sapan, Ed and everyone|pg||
nt|toral5: will they bid?|pg||
nt|peachy: he has 9 tricks if thee dont lead hearts|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: Looks like fingers on the F5 there|pg||

mb|p|nt|jtr: Transfer response|pg||
nt|jtr: 1@h showing specifically three cards i imagine|pg||
nt|brolucius: West's 1@H rebid suggests three-card heart support.|pg||
nt|andyv:  5 imps to Lebanon on board 3 as they bid 5@hx|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Yesterday Hedy advocated rebidding 2@S as opposed to 1NT on a hand similar to the current W hand because of @Hxx :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  aggressive dbl by Bocchi has put S in a quandry|pg||
nt|andyv:  3@c will probably end it|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Interesting options for Madala here ..he has best hand at table...hasnt said a word yet :) |pg||
nt|andyv:  right... that's the quandry|pg||
nt|bjacobs: so you might as well go for it|pg||
nt|sybarra: I figure, one bid gets this hand off my chest  |pg||
nt|xenya: quite sensible though|pg||
nt|rodvenn: pushed|pg||
nt|rodvenn: we dont know who thinks. probably charlsen|pg||
nt|Walddk2: When fixed stay fixed. Madala thinking about raising I suppose. I don't Charlsen is thinking|pg||
nt|rodvenn: the BBO operator probably cant see on the other side of the screen|pg||
nt|jbgood: my press colleagues here think it is Charlsen who is thinking|pg||
nt|hedyg: Lohay wondering how much his K@D is worth|pg||
nt|bagman: Personally I would have taken the more aggressive 2NT approach|pg||
nt|brolucius: In the open room there was no spade overcall at all, I am told, and declarer guessed the @HA. |pg||
nt|sharkey: On previous hand In OR Madala entered dummy to play @H towards his hand - like he knew E had Ax... - one trump loser only|pg||
nt|brolucius: I don't like 3@C much on those values. 2@D or 2NT looks better. |pg||
nt|sharkey: after @D lead|pg||
nt|bagman: South has a good hand and can see 7 quick tricks|pg||

mb|2N!|nt|Vugraphznk: How about no bid?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I'm 18 and even I wouldn't Michaels it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But every time it's not your hand you have given the show away, and there is nothing that suggests that it *is* your hand with the values North has|pg||

nt|schtsch: they have discussion on 50% of the borads|pg||
nt|haans: 3@C-4@C did the trick|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: France started out this last round with 1 VP more than the Netherlands so if all three teams score 25, France will win and Sweden will end just behind Netherlands|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  only problem with NT... no tricks|pg||
nt|andyv:  S will scramble for 7 tricks|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: 2NT is so seldom natural these days .. have we found a rare example?  :-)|pg||
nt|andyv:  Bocchi trying to decide|pg||
nt|andyv:  Q10 of @s makes him doubt that it's natural|pg||
nt|andyv:  but his minors are pretty sick|pg||
nt|andyv:  passing will probably push the board|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: several kibs think 2NT = scramble|pg||
nt|mbruun: Dbl of a Michaels could be treated as 7+ with 3c support. 2NT or 3H GF with 4c support, and if you have a penalty double just pass 2 Sp and wack them in the next roundat tti|pg||
nt|mdgraham: values? Well, all those fours must be worth something|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: *Tries not to laugh*|pg||
nt|sybarra: no chuckling at the table Bas |pg||
nt|bjacobs: I would pass as well, but the fact is that 5-5's can be quite powerful.  And the opponents don't always nail you, even when they should|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Looks like a playable method, Mathias|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The problem might be if partner intervenes before you get your chance to double|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Where did you nick it?|pg||
nt|mbruun: From Duboin-Sementa|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Another possibility is to double the 2@S bid saying: "partner, I am interested in penalties"|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That might stop partner from making a bid before you can get your claws on the next hand's bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: if only he could get to dummy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: By the way, 2@C shows diamonds as you may have guessed|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: It was Charlsen thinking, Madala had a swift pass|pg||
nt|sybarra: now for the cue bidding|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I count 16 tricks in any contract but @S EW :)|pg||
nt|gulyas: I am happy with the outcome as I am biased, but still surprised at the play|pg||
nt|athene: 6@S is there, but unlikely to be bid|pg||
nt|athene: oh sorry only 11 tricks|pg||
nt|athene: but surely they won't get higher than 4@S |pg||
nt|bagman: EW can make only 8 tricks in hearts|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@C FG 4+@C or balanced|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 2@D is nf with @D|pg||
nt|drorp: i hope 3@C is NF|pg||
nt|drorp: trouble now|pg||
nt|othered1: Ignore that, please|pg||
nt|haans: but some do not|pg||
nt|ritong: volcker a des points d honneur, mais pas un beau jeu|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: 2@D would also leave more room for bidding|pg||
nt|bagman: Hoping that the cards lay well|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hi Vassilis, welcome|pg||
nt|drorp: Barbosa wants to double 3@S :)|pg||
nt|latwy: ta|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: 2@D only shows a sound raise to 3@C, so North has plenty for that. Then he can raise to 3@C on distributional values and fewer points (to be obstructive).|pg||
nt|lesniak: lub skontruje 1 ba|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Hey Vassilis|pg||
nt|mamos: i think East has shown 4 controls so West may well be off to the grand |pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 clubs is?   |pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I wonder what 3@S would've been|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: OR bid 1@S p 4@S ap|pg||
nt|jkotor: impas karo jest bezpieczny|pg||
nt|babs59: oops|pg||
nt|drorp: he'll double 3NT too|pg||
nt|drorp: maybe even south can, holding a club stop|pg||
nt|athene: south should be close to doubling 3nt|pg||
nt|drorp: and good diamonds stops|pg||
nt|athene: north should have more than just spades, to double 3@S|pg||
nt|athene: if he only had four or five spade tricks and nothing else he would pass 3@S i am sure|pg||
nt|jkotor: a potem S uduszony na kolory starsze|pg||
nt|barnets: perhaps south should have returned a diamond and not a heart|pg||
nt|athene: north's delayed 3@H showing lots of shape but not so many HCP|pg||
nt|barnets: as south knew the third spade was not cashing|pg||
nt|athene: i am not so sure he did - might not north have led as he did from @SAQ5?|pg||

nt|brolucius: Is the 1@H rebid forcing, David?|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@c drury|pg||
nt|atabey: 2@c is a version of drury I guess. and 2@s shows a good raise for 1@s-2@s|pg||
nt|hedyg: he obviously devalued the K@d|pg||
nt|bagman: 3NT by N would have made only with diamond lead|pg||
nt|sharkey: cud go 2@D - 2@D - 3 NT|pg||
nt|brolucius: Then East might well lead a major suit.|pg||
nt|sharkey: The way this match is going - Yes|pg||
nt|bagman: East might figure out that leading a diamond might give the 9th trick|pg||
nt|lesniak: pokazujac sile ok 9 PC|pg||

nt|gulyas: right, thats what happened in the OR, in precision, its an easy bid|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I usually play that as 7-9 distr. with 4-5 @S...|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Oh, they play Precision? :)|pg||
nt|gulyas: yep|pg||
nt|koksoy: I dont  think  they  will  try 4@S|pg||
nt|koksoy: 10 easy  tricks|pg||
nt|rv: this could go down if @s ruff is found|pg||
nt|drorp: there must be a reason for P to double a forcing 3@S bid, south should come to the right conclusion, and he does|pg||
nt|rhelle: this will not take long, I suspect ... next!|pg||
nt|toral5: i think he ll claim 10 soon|pg||
nt|jillan:  a small @D now?|pg||

pc|c6|nt|jtr: The way i play it is 99% forcing as 1@h is unlimited|pg||
nt|brolucius: I see.|pg||
nt|brolucius: The bidding continues naturally after such a rebid?|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: lol at the Impage :)|pg||
nt|jtr: Useful to have all those @cs concealed|pg||
nt|brolucius: 6@S has been rescored as one down.|pg||

nt|brolucius: Justice!!|pg||
nt|jtr: Well, responder must have a way of forcing through a relay|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you can make game in clubs though:)|pg||
nt|petergill: Normal Precision bidding 1@C 16+, 2@D 5+ @D and 8+ HCP GF, 2@S 5+ @S|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: Bocchi opened the screen and they started discussing even before the lead :)|pg||
nt|rodvenn: claims|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: True|pg||
nt|babs59: last time I tried 3NT with 10xxx (and against 1@C better minor) I had the same problem|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@S also minimum |pg||
nt|petergill: 2NT asks|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|kiwi_joker: better not cover 10!|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|rv: now it will make since there won't an entry to North hand for @s ruff or @d gets pitched on @CK|pg||
nt|drorp: spade lead and heart switch seems like the best start|pg||
nt|athene: he might jump ace here to get the clubs going fast|pg||
nt|april7: ace and @C E might save some tricks|pg||
nt|athene: just a pity about the @CQ in the wrong place|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Good save as 4@S was making.|pg||
nt|barnets: he would play the @S Q normally|pg||

pc|h3|nt|sybarra: now does N have stiff ace or q?|pg||

nt|schtsch: well, 8:0 is a great start|pg||

nt|mdgraham: must have been irresistible|pg||
nt|rv: good stop by Swiss ladies here|pg||
nt|drorp: this can be a big number for NS, they can take 2 clubs 4 hearts and 1 spade, easily|pg||
pc|c8|nt|athene: east should just count himself thankful that his partner bid diamonds rather than clubs|pg||
nt|mbruun: 11 tricks now. Spade entry for the diamonds |pg||
nt|brolucius: Bocchi bid 2NT on the North cards at the other table. If you put your cursor over the Open Room result, top-left, you can see the other auction. |pg||
nt|marlowepi: our mathematicians in the audience can tell us what the odds are, when you have 2 six card suits, that five of the cards will be the same in the two suits|pg||
nt|marlowepi: they must make astronomical look small|pg||
nt|sybarra: praying for 2/2 @D after @H's dont break or is there another way?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: with 43 club break do not even need to guess Ds or have good luck there|pg||
nt|mamos: yes i was thinking about 4-3 as always its about combining chances|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4 discrads on black suit winners|pg||
nt|mamos: whats the best order|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes I see the club 4/3  maybe easier |pg||
nt|sybarra: I am told 7 sp only 2000, but they you push them to 7 nt most likely |pg||
nt|athene: it was easier for Bocchi in the other room as his partner had jumped in spades in the bidding showing five|pg||
nt|barnets: 3 boards only played italy up by 25,|pg||
nt|tokay1975: dia back now|pg||
nt|tokay1975: best def|pg||
nt|milton_se: D back will make it interesting|pg||
nt|jillan:  I agree with the specs that a @H switsch and the @SJ back MAY be the ultimate play, BUT how will he know what K Nort holds @S or @H|pg||
nt|jillan:  do they have THAT good signals?|pg||
nt|yvesj49: michel se prend pour thierry roland lol|pg||
pc|c3|nt|jtr: @h raises show five cards (obviously) and are limit bids|pg||
nt|brolucius: With only 4 hearts and a rubbish hand, East has to sign off in 1NT, 2@C or 2@H?|pg||
nt|jtr: Others play the 1@h rebid as any weak hand which i think is inferior|pg||
nt|jtr: Right|pg||
nt|jtr: Anyway, how is he doing in 4@h?|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: He has to decide if it's KTx or K9x or K8 onside|pg||
nt|jtr: Not as simple as that is it?|pg||
nt|brolucius: North held off his king to give declarer a guess if he held Q-J-9-x-x, but he has given West a chance to pick up the trumps for no loser now.|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: @C aren't splitting so he should ruff a @C in dummy?|pg||
nt|jtr: North did very well not to cover|pg||
nt|pasker: declarer likely to be at least down 2 here, 2@S 2@H, 1@D, 1@C|pg||
nt|marlowepi: have to play trump ace first in case they are 4-0. then king of H, club to ace and club ruff, heart to Q and club ruff, claim|pg||
nt|mamos: you dont want to go off trying to set up Club when Diamonds 2-2 alll the time |pg||
nt|schtsch: for handball of course|pg||
nt|yuval10: but 14 imps for Bulgaria nontheless|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|tez: it was 8/10|pg||
nt|andyv:  even with fancy foot work in @s suit, there still are only 7 tricks|pg||
nt|hedyg: claim|pg||
nt|gulyas: Szalay, easily the best player of the team (and probably of Hungary, too, some may say) is a rare sitout|pg||
nt|athene: declarer will probably try to ruff hearts in dummy|pg||
nt|hedyg: i thought Dumbovich was the best on the team|pg||
nt|gulyas: he is expected to play the rest of the matches|pg||
nt|bagman: South might be worried about the result as some might open the N hand and reaching game is then easier|pg||
nt|andyv:  there's no humor in bridge|pg||
nt|andyv:  :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: That wasn't actually a slow duck by Norh|pg||
nt|athene: they aren't getting four hearts |pg||
nt|april7: if N would have taken the ace|pg||
nt|drorp: not rising with @CA is bad, now probably 2 down at most|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: North even|pg||
nt|peachy: well done on defense to keep it to ten tricks, although doesnt matter|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mbruun: Made it easy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Note that Bocchi passed over 1@S at the other table|pg||
nt|snetram:  jestem zwolennikiem teorii Jacka PszczoÅy, Å¼e z dwoma starszymi czwÃ³rkami zawsze daje siÄ Staymana. OczywiÅcie o ile z dwoma starszymi czwÃ³rkami odpowiada siÄ 2 kier.|pg||
nt|drorp: heart is crucial now|pg||
nt|athene: there is an interesting point of strategy here, whether you should lead dummy's suit on these auctions|pg||
nt|april7: wrong pick so 1 down only|pg||
nt|athene: just because partner has the spades held doesn't mean you necessarily are best off leading them at trick 1|pg||
nt|drorp: well now declearer suddenly has 8 tricks, and a disaster board turns to be a normal score|pg||
nt|athene: ok, it is likely to be safe, but not much more|pg||
nt|tokay1975: also if east plays  heart  and  west returns sp jack declarer  can make |pg||
pc|c9|nt|latwy: nie piki s¹ na 4 lewy|pg||
nt|idc: I guess NS must have an agreement that South still has to have some tolerance for @s, even when he bids 4@h|pg||
nt|mdgraham: just been looking at the EW CC - relay precision, lots of writing   |pg||
nt|toral5: so italy open their account.where sementa competed up to 3@S|pg||
nt|idc: Otherwise, passing 4@h looks more normal|pg||
nt|othered1: normal strategy of going after the side suit first to protect from being ruffed down.  |pg||
nt|toral5: does 4@H show some cards in @S?|pg||

nt|hedyg: and Roland?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, sorry, I forgot. Him and Roland.|pg||
nt|bagman: The defense needs to cash out now|pg||

nt|sybarra: stiff q would have been interesting with N |pg||
nt|Walddk2: But the finesse is with the odds as it also caters to AQx onside|pg||
nt|mdgraham: declarer got a diamond lead and club switch. Misguessed trumps|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: A two-suited overcall would've been less likely with @SQ- I think|pg||
nt|paulg:  well defended but you'd hope that it would be flat |pg||
nt|hedyg: well, a careless 10@H lead......|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/Events/ebl/2010ostend/default.asp  for convention cards and other useful information|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Bocchi had shuffled, put his cards back in, taken a new board, placed the tray and board on the table and took out his cards before EW knew what had happened|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's not a record|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Obermair inquiring about the @D, laughter all around|pg||
nt|brolucius: Playing a two-level response as game-forcing has some advantages, of course. If it didn't, most of the USA wold not use it. But it is not that wonderful. Here, for example, East ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: did not want to cue-bid the @CA (because he wanted to limit his hand) but West was still unlimited.  |pg||
nt|barnets: another 6 imps to latvia when italy reached 4@S|pg||
nt|barnets: on the last|pg||
nt|gulyas: sure, some would say Dumbovich, or Winkler is better, its open to discussion:)|pg||
nt|athene: he had a heart-club squeeze even if east had long clubs|pg||
nt|hedyg: well Winkler is not on the team|pg||
nt|hedyg: not this time..|pg||
nt|athene: another boring 4major+1 push :) so this discussion can go on |pg||
nt|gulyas: he opted not to play due to personal reasons and work|pg||
nt|hedyg: tough decision|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Interesting: would you try for slam with the S hand opposite a strong 1NT?|pg||
nt|gulyas: but he WAS asked:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: :) of course he was!|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: The board has been put in the wrong way around...|pg||
nt|koksoy: double  difference & one overtrick  is 7 imps  for  Wales |pg||
nt|koksoy: at the  3rd board|pg||
nt|babs59: a reasonable shot by South tho|pg||
nt|petergill: After 16 rounds, EW, who play in all Italy's toughest matches and sat out matches like Slovakia, Latvia and Wales, are +0.46 imps/bd for 11 matches played |pg||
nt|april7: luckyn outcome though|pg||
nt|athene: maybe lauria has been taking lessons from Phil Hellmuth - he too can dodge bullets :)|pg||
nt|drorp: E-W really lucked out here, bidding game with 11 to 9 and a misfit, might still cost them as a normal 3@C contract probably makes|pg||
nt|april7: N will reach 4@S and making+1 losing only 1 @H and 1 @D|pg||
nt|athene: it depends how 3@H plays|pg||
nt|athene: the big danger would be if declarer gets forced too much and can't bring in the clubs|pg||
nt|xenya: or 4@H?|pg||
nt|athene: but i think as the cards lie he should be able to manage things|pg||
nt|toral5: we surely are heading for a gr8 encounter|pg||

nt|stc: 5@d was made because the def helped dec to eliminate @h@S, and dec guessed the @c position|pg||
nt|brolucius: In other words, it is difficult for both players to combine getting their strength across and cue-bidding their controls.|pg||
nt|gulyas: its a very nice hand|pg||
nt|athene: you have to be confident to bid 4@H with that south hands|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Or 4@D, if you play SA Texas, I guess :)|pg||
nt|athene: i remember lauria-versace had a misunderstanding in that position in the bermuda bowl|pg||
nt|babs59: and unfortunate that East gets horribly squeezed in 5@C|pg||
nt|babs59: on board 2 the Italians found the 5@C vulnerable save, but EW bid on to 5@S making|pg||
nt|andyv:  S still wondering what to do with her 2 headed monster|pg||
nt|mdgraham: anybody watching who is Welsh may not be too amused at that, Peter :) |pg||
nt|petergill: The favourable vulnerability led Lauria to choose the more aggressive overcall|pg||
nt|frululu: 6@s here ?|pg||
nt|schtsch: a grand on a finesse|pg||
nt|rv: NS could runinto a penalty here|pg||
nt|drorp: now that's more like a 1@S opening :)|pg||
nt|april7: true|pg||
nt|athene: if the defence don't get their heart in the bag declarer might throw it on a club, making 12 |pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: This one|pg||
nt|babs59: not what I'd have predicted|pg||

nt|jkotor: byæ mo¿e co uzgadniaj¹ tam, lub przeciwnicy protestuj¹ i jest sêdzia|pg||
mb|1H!|nt|brolucius: Now I think of it, 4@H was a bit of a pot on the East hand - with an unhelpful void in partner's first-bid suit. Still, overbidding is not a fault at this level.|pg||
nt|hedyg: a drop of blood, Bas corrected the score|pg||
nt|hedyg: now, now, lets not go overboard !|pg||
nt|athene: well 4@D is ok because partner knows it's something cute so will probably just bid 4@H|pg||
nt|athene: but 4@H - that is in danger of sounding natural|pg||
nt|andyv:  interesting hand for S|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i think lauria may have the last say|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 1@S by north?|pg||

nt|jkotor: *so|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Yes|pg||
nt|bagman: The bad spade break dooms 4@S|pg||
nt|babs59: unless it's some Ghestem|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 2@D apparently shows some kind of two-suiter with @S|pg||
nt|babs59: the 2S bid indicates that it's shown @D and @S|pg||
nt|babs59: thanks Bas|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hard not to do something as S|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: W is happy|pg||
nt|drorp: ah, now they will be pushed to game either way|pg||
nt|athene: 2@S must be alerted because they play constructive raises (i.e. a bit stronger than usual)|pg||
nt|april7: now 4@S because of singleton @H|pg||
nt|drorp: sacrifice is possible, costs 800 on optimal defence|pg||
nt|athene: with weaker hands going via 1nt|pg||
nt|athene: the upper limit on simple overcalls seems to be rising|pg||
nt|rhelle: and stays out of trouble|pg||

mb|p|nt|capercliff: well 3N was stiff? Only from North|pg||

mb|1S!|nt|jtr: 1@s alerted as it may be canape (Walsh)|pg||
nt|atabey: it was the first blood indeed. only the other side :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Yes, they said 10 first then 11... :(|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: minors break badly tho|pg||
nt|Walddk2: what would 2@D be I wonder|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Final contract 6NT= without @D lead?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Looking at only the N/S hands, you want to be in 6@C ... go figure|pg||
nt|mbruun: 6N is a decent spot. Without a diamond lead its wash, and otherwise you have to get the diamonds right|pg||
nt|rodvenn: was 1 sp alerted?|pg||
nt|xenya: and he did find Madala with two beautiful cards|pg||

nt|Walddk2: I have got a problem, please help. Bridge, cricket, football, tennis. Where to start and end?|pg||
nt|iain sime: Italy made 5@D on board two by stripping the majors and leading a club to the nine. North had to win and lead from @C king.|pg||

nt|rv: especially since double was spontaneous|pg||
nt|drorp: 2@S probably 8-10|pg||
nt|athene: it's a bit like getting straight back on a horse after falling off - EW dodged 800 penalty last board, so they give NS another shot at it :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Specs suggest that 4@S may not make with 3@C losers and a @H, imo W never gets a chance to play @C and the declarer would pitch 2@C on @H.|pg||
nt|athene: most people would double with that south hand intending to rebid hearts, i think|pg||
nt|toral5: another flat M game now|pg||

nt|viren169: too pushy for 2N|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: You can's beat 6NT on any lead|pg||
nt|paulg:  true, but 5@d the practical call|pg||
nt|capercliff: maybe South might have done well to bid 3@s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@S shows 0-3 cards|pg||
nt|bagman: 4@C is makeable|pg||
nt|ziff:  Preempted the wrong player this time, but white vs. red is too tempting|pg||
nt|athene: 2@C transfer to diamonds|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|hedyg: np Bas|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Damn bridge players, the world would be better off without us :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: N cannot bid inverted 2@d|pg||

nt|petergill: 1@C 16+ any, 1@D 0-7 any|pg||
nt|Gerben42: may be interesting to note that Madala is a junior player originally from Argentina|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt must show better than minimum, so duboin might get vaguely interested|pg||

nt|koksoy: they  are far from  finding  their  spade fit|pg||
nt|petergill: Wales are not in the top five in the section, so my statement is simply stating the facts. |pg||
nt|ahri: 6 is not completely safe either |pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Not if Bocchi doesn't bid 4@H :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: If that's their system :)|pg||
nt|wstuart: a bit less than the 57% which is needed for a grand to be break even.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1NT is 14-16|pg||

nt|fokal: le flancavait filé|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: Bas!!!!!!|pg||

nt|wstuart: assuming a small is bid at the other table.|pg||
nt|schtsch: well, this is one of those 5/7 boards|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|kiwi_joker: if South could find 3NT on Jx .. it makes|pg||
nt|andyv:  everyone pointing to 3N|pg||
nt|andyv:  and W did miss a chance to really muddle things up by not bidding 3@h on his 2nd turn|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Because the diamond suit is "frozen"|pg||
nt|mdgraham: looks like North took 4NT as agreeing diamonds|pg||
nt|henryb:  you might try 3@s instead. That after all was the purpose of that bid|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Double = 4+ spades|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So on this auction 1@S shows the minors|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2NT relay|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@S seems to be a good spot to stop in|pg||
nt|gulyas: he knows N probably has wasted values in @H - unless he has the A|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: In Rubensohl (the way I play it), 3@H is 5+@S, so 3NT might just be SO or offer to play systematically|pg||
nt|gulyas: with a bad hand and no fit, you could still just bid 3@S|pg||
nt|athene: NS play 3@H is invitational+ so i assume with any minimum north just bids 3@S|pg||
nt|gulyas: now S may get excited|pg||
nt|athene: south might content himself with 4@H|pg||
nt|hedyg: scared to bid 4@H?|pg||
nt|april7: 3 down but possible 4 if ruff in @C isfound|pg||
nt|drorp: I think they will take it now|pg||
nt|drorp: defence is quite straight forward|pg||
nt|athene: or 3nt of course, if you catch partner with an 18 count :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Sorry, he overcalled, so a little more|pg||
nt|jillan:  no it is 15-18|pg||
nt|fokal: Est arait du tirer le 10 de @h avant de rejouer roi de @s et @s|pg||

nt|lesniak: natomiast wychodzi 5 trefli|pg||
nt|jkotor: ale obrona wychodzi na trafieniu kiera|pg||

nt|petergill: unless he can find a 10th trick somehow|pg||
nt|barnets: def will duck a @D|pg||
nt|barnets: and thats that|pg||
nt|athene: from the point of view of the club suit it would have been better to make north declarer|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They don't even have to when @CK is removed|pg||
nt|athene: but i guess that's not really feasible|pg||
nt|barnets: right|pg||
nt|athene: declarer won't even go for the diamonds, i wouldn't think - he knows that's hopeless|pg||
nt|athene: he will perhaps run the @SJ hoping to switch to hearts|pg||
nt|xenya: on the previous hand, NS in the other did bid up to 4@H, and EW decided to take a save|pg||
nt|athene: i suppose he might play the @DQ hoping it gets ducked by both defenders, so he has stolen a trick|pg||
nt|jillan:  they made the 4@H a thÂ´a other table so 13 to Italy|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|andyv:  and my apologies... She missed a chance:)|pg||

nt|andyv:  this may get expensive|pg||
nt|andyv:  bad trump split and immediate taps|pg||
nt|ahri: on a rounded suit lead you need 4-3 diamonds to throw that other loser, and if finesse of spades won't work you need west not to have fourth diamond|pg||

nt|Walddk2: :)|pg||

nt|brolucius: Oh, I see now that David has found one. That's good.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: two aces + @DQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: South thinks North has shown 5-5 is my quess|pg||
nt|mbruun: South seems to think that partner promised 55|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I assume they have a strong club base, hence the 3@D, and the small misunderstanding|pg||
nt|mbruun: Sry slow typing by me|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Lots of whispering on both sides|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's a really tough hand to bid, to be honest|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@C is 12-14/19-23 balanced, or natural|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Then I don't understand 3@D at all ...|pg||
nt|paulg:  so you play in 3N opposite the @sA and lose the first five clubs with 5@d cold?|pg||
nt|andyv:  no, gives too much info away and hand isn't distributional enough|pg||
nt|bagman: I would not X myself but I admire the courage of those who do X|pg||
nt|hedyg: (as my English husband used to tell me )|pg||
nt|hedyg: they become British, never English|pg||
nt|gulyas: he is not sure where that would take him|pg||
nt|gulyas: 5@S or 6@S now?|pg||
nt|hedyg: so what is 5@C now? fit or cue?|pg||
nt|jkotor: czyli tutaj wynik bardzo wiele znaczy|pg||
nt|bagman: The club lead gives 8th trick|pg||
nt|koksoy: after club  lead..  Sementha  has 8 tricks..  and  will  try  for  jay  jay  squeze|pg||
nt|petergill: North played South for @DJ rather than @DK|pg||
nt|petergill: Find an 11th trick somewhere, I mean|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I'm being told that on board 4 (3NT X-1) Bocchi sits North, declaring 2@SX|pg||
nt|robinswr: only a spade lead will let his make|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@S would have been 2 off, 4@H also going down|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe only 1 down in 3@S|pg||
nt|jillan:  They shouild get their tricks in i n time since the singelton @S is evident in dummy....|pg||
nt|viren169: tough lead...|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: The ecats site is more useful that the tournament site|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is the only slam that does not make. I think 6@C, 6@H, 6@S and 6NT all make|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 6@H?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Oh well, hearts 6-1|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But it's a better contract than 6@D|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Indeed, in fact, I think it's probably the correct contract IN THEORY|pg||
nt|bjacobs: No, perhaps 6@C|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, good luck, North|pg||
nt|mdgraham: guess well|pg||
nt|brolucius: Chance of a slam is not wonderfulo, after the single raise, but typically the Italians will take a look in that direction.|pg||
nt|bagman: Maybe W relayed to see if E had 4-5-1-3|pg||
nt|vasmar: vulnerable no|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't think many do, Ben|pg||

nt|tez: first partscore swing i think|pg||
nt|hedyg: E denied a singleton i guess|pg||
nt|bagman: Then there might be a legitimate slam|pg||
nt|barnets: the 12 imps Iatvia gained is when after a natural 2N - North Bocchi looked for a major fit with 4-3-3-3 found one and went down|pg||
nt|athene: ok, going to the 5-level is a very serious statement and duboin will now surely bid the slam|pg||
nt|athene: wow, he didn't, even with all the trumps|pg||
nt|gulyas: interesting|pg||
nt|athene: i guess his rationale is, if north had everything needed he would just bid blackwood himself|pg||
nt|petergill: Could have played @HA, ruff 2 hearts ...|pg||
nt|cumino: On @D lead she could make|pg||
nt|rv: West should have been a bit circumspect after South showed 10+cards in red suits and with void in partner's pre-empt suit|pg||

nt|rodvenn: then Hofta probably would have gone on to game.|pg||

nt|rv: I expect this to go 1 down since too much work to be done|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: It might win a partscore but often it gives away info or induces partner to overcompete|pg||
nt|sybarra: does he play ace and spade now?|pg||
nt|brolucius: West limited his hand by not doubling 2NT (which showed a weak diamond raise). East did not have a clear-cut leap to 4@S over the delayed double.|pg||
nt|athene: hmmm ok a wheel has come off here|pg||
nt|hedyg: i dont see that N ever showed @s fit|pg||
nt|athene: if 3nt showed better than minimum, north should back-pedal all the way after that|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: N looks puzzled|pg||
nt|athene: since he has really a bad hand|pg||
nt|gulyas: N bid 5NT to pick a slam I guess|pg||
nt|athene: if north is looking puzzled now,  i would suspect that he thought south had hearts|pg||
nt|hedyg: seems like he was protecting K@H all the way|pg||
nt|athene: but then 3nt makes no sense because he has no spade stop|pg||
nt|gulyas: I think he should have bid 4@S over 4@H|pg||
nt|athene: yes, 5@C was definitely an overbid|pg||
nt|athene: if the auction all means what we think it does|pg||
nt|gulyas: @S stop? 3@H showed @Ss|pg||
nt|athene: but i think there are probably three interpretations of this auction here - north's, south's, and ours :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: where is the undo button?|pg||
nt|gulyas: :)|pg||
nt|athene: maybe four - North's, South's, ours, and the right one|pg||

nt|lechcold: wiem, ¿e w dzisiejszym stylu 11PC i 54 na starszych to prawie dla wszystkich bezproblemowe otwarcie...|pg||
nt|robinswr: on good days the KQ of spades would be on lead|pg||
nt|rhelle: he play low = encouraging on Q and A - so the 3 was very inviting|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: E a montre des @S et O a montre des @H|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|gulyas: we need all the imps we can get our hands on|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Italian going on now|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: Excusez-moi, ce n'est pas possible pour moi de creeer des accents :(|pg||
pc|h4|nt|hedyg: i dont like 1NT with xx in @H|pg||
nt|pasker: S could have returned a @S for ruff here at trick 2|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Something with minori, which I suspect means minors :)|pg||
nt|snetram:  przy ujawnionym renonsie trefl ukÅad 6-5 jest nietrafialny|pg||

nt|jkotor: raczej za³o¿y siê uk³ad 6430 Krzysiu?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Zmudzinski would like "a dozen vodka at this stage of the hand"|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: w pozosta³ych meczach po 4-5 rozdaniach ¿aden wynik nie pzrekracza 2-0|pg||
nt|babs59: maybe she thought the 4@D bid showed some 6-6|pg||
nt|babs59: after all, the 4@H bid had given a reprieve|pg||
nt|petergill: East can make, if he can see all the cards. |pg||
nt|jkotor: jest te¿ mo¿liwa wpustka kierowa przeciw E|pg||

nt|kiwi_joker: I dont think it can make now, can it Andy?|pg||
nt|andyv:  i don't think so|pg||
nt|andyv:  can't ruff 2@cs and still pick up the @d suit... and he still has a @s to lose|pg||
nt|andyv:  if either minor behaved this would be a quick claimer|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Had to win first trick and play three top clubs, methinks|pg||
nt|paulg:  Versace may block the clubs here to get a heart through|pg||
nt|Walddk2: However, I also admire some imagination when you know that your opponents are much better players|pg||
nt|petergill: At the other table, North opened 1@S, East passed (sensible and disciplined) and Madala as South has responded 1NT, which could lead to a @D partscore, I guess|pg||
nt|Gerben42: the maximum for an Italian 1@S is quite high, still not passing was a position|pg||
nt|petergill: Actually, Lauria did well not to play hearts too early, else North would have been able to beat him|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|andyv:  I think so|pg||

nt|ziff:  Ruffing out @H KQx. The Squeeze may work, too|pg||
nt|athene: ok this is just giving up trying to make it but i guess that was never really an option|pg||
nt|robinswr: only a diamond lead beats 4hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Where else would the defence get the tricks from with that dummy?|pg||
nt|idc: The 1NT response was game forcing, artificial|pg||
nt|ritong: tu es pardonné:)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|capercliff: with just the A@s N doesnt have to bid 3N|pg||
nt|bagman: Sure but AQxx Kxxxx x Kxx gives some play, I think|pg||
nt|andyv:  the plus side is that both NS are original passers so they shouldn't get carried away by overbidding|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No offence intended of course|pg||
nt|andyv:  maybe... although dbl would seem indicated if that were the case|pg||
nt|petergill: East knows from Trick 1 that South has @DK and N has @DQ, so he knows all the high card layout|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|iceblue: morning, its 17:20 here :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  now the bad news|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it is by no means trivial to wind up in 3N, making while 4S fails|pg||
nt|bagman: S is not going to like discarding but there's not much he can do wrong really|pg||
nt|petergill: NS lead 3rd/5th, so East knows @D's were 4-4  |pg||
nt|rv: now 2 down|pg||
nt|toral5: he ll try a dbl hook in @H|pg||
nt|besbes: c est deja super|pg||

pc|h5|nt|jtr: Is there one for group B ?|pg||
nt|tez: 1 nt ok for me..|pg||
nt|brolucius: That says it all. Englishmen want Murray to do well at Wimbledon. Scots want England to lose to Germany. Sad!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No matches at Wimbledon today I hear, that solves one problem|pg||
nt|stc: just switch some of those Q's|pg||
nt|iain sime: It will mean that we will be able to watch the rest of the tournament without being bombarded with references to 1966 for a start.|pg||
nt|brolucius: They show Gemmill's wonder-goal quite a lot.|pg||
nt|jkotor: "A mo¿e by tak ilociówkê karow¹ panowie?"|pg||

nt|andyv:  or bid 3@s... she bid 4@d so her @ds had to be longer|pg||
nt|toral5: i dont think north ll risk 4th @D|pg||
nt|rhelle: a 4th @d is risky if South can't overruff dummy, as it would allow a @s pitch|pg||
nt|toral5: will wait for his @S king|pg||
nt|ritong: oui, bas est très bon au piano|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Merci :)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jtr: Wonderful!|pg||
nt|atabey: nobody would like that but 1@s also very risky. I thk 1NT ok too|pg||

nt|andyv:  E should refuse to over ruff here|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Btw, England can still score the Bronze Medal in the Women's series|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|petergill: so they have stopped in 3@D, which looks makeable|pg||
nt|petergill: Declarer, unaware of the friendly @S position, is playing safely and sensibly for 7 tricks, I think|pg||

nt|Gerben42: +80 feels like a good score with 9@C out|pg||
nt|petergill: After he ruffs in dummy, he is deciding whether to plays spades or hearts next|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|viren169: Not a lot defense do with the spade Ace sitting nicely for Declarer|pg||

nt|xenya: fireworks here|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is an example of Restricted Choice. If declarer had similar holdings in both the minors, he might have chosen to lead a diamond instead.|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: I must say, NS don't seem to be intimidated at all... Not letting EW play they usually do, ask to see claims, etc.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: On board 3, Bocchi-Madala discovered the club weakness, but they are uncomfortably high in 5@H. It also got a spade lead|pg||
nt|mamos: i hadnt even thought about if it was making just expected to bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: pretty likely that S had Q@c|pg||
nt|brolucius: Double (competitive) can mean clubs and spade tolerance (usually a doubleton).|pg||
nt|Gerben42: with this @H stopper you need @C for 0 loser|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: Adam Kaplan wrote a book on the "Tired RHO squeeze", applying here as well :)|pg||
nt|xenya: 5@D now -- can W or E bid 6 after that?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Madala would like to get doubled in a number of diamonds. Contemplating how to achieve that|pg||
nt|rodvenn: 6@dx = 3 down?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He has no defence against any contract by EW|pg||
nt|rodvenn: Hofta will go on to 6 and Madala will save i think. Not poosible to get minus 4 in practise|pg||
nt|sharkey: slam time|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@d=4+|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@H= negative freebid|pg||
nt|brolucius: Why not raise to 4@H?|pg||
nt|athene: EW do play a slightly strange form of Polish club|pg||
nt|andyv:  just needed 2-2 @ds and @hs to behave...not too much to ask|pg||
nt|rv: 2@c seems precision style|pg||
nt|drorp: yep, and they will|pg||
nt|athene: EW will surely take the money rather than risk 5@H|pg||
nt|april7: 4@S only 3 down|pg||
nt|drorp: 4@S from south surely, then versace will have to bid 5@H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The key is of course the singleton club opposite nothing|pg||
nt|tokay1975: even if  dummy has 5small spades  6h has a chance to make without heart lead so they will get there easily|pg||
nt|jillan:  and it promises a singelton|pg||
nt|yuval10: puppet, i persume|pg||
nt|viren169: Price may muddy the waters by opening 3rd in hand|pg||
nt|mgchat: 3@C MAINTENANT|pg||

nt|Walddk4: 2NT game-forcing with support I assume|pg||

mb|3S|nt|Walddk4: 3NT balanced minimum|pg||
nt|brgpro: hi|pg||
nt|capercliff: yes 1@s was pretty normal? 4@s is maybe a better contract|pg||
nt|paulg:  1@s is very usual for them|pg||
nt|sharkey: sry - missing 2 aces|pg||
nt|lesniak: to pogarsza sytuacje|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: lepsze tu jest ustalenie kolor+fit - 4@C|pg||
nt|antoniz: chyba nie w tej sekwencji|pg||
nt|lesniak: bo mam nadzieje ze Cezary moze powiedziec 3 kier forsujace|pg||
nt|andyv:  spec says 8-11 any singleton, 3@h asks and 3N shows @d singleton|pg||
nt|hedyg: Bas says Bocchi was told 2@H is strong so maybe it isnt a NFB|pg||
nt|iain sime: This has allowed South another chance.|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@S = minors |pg||
nt|barnets: but in fact they led a spade v 3N in other room from south dont ask me why|pg||
nt|schtsch: low heart lead in closed|pg||
nt|latwy: tymczasem nasze panie grubo przegrywaj¹ z ostatni¹ dru¿yn¹|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@C should do the trick|pg||
nt|jillan:  West has promised a single with 2NT, East can now find out which one it is|pg||
nt|viren169: but it wont stop N/S bidding the game|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I just saw a 1st in hand opening much worse than that :)|pg||
nt|mgchat: difficile pour l'ouvreur de rajouter le 4eme )))|pg||
mb|4C|nt|hedyg: 2@d=@H|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2@S is what Kelsey used to describe as daisy-picking.|pg||
nt|athene: they play 4-card heart opener so the weak NT option in 1@C denies 4 hearts|pg||
nt|gulyas: sry, 15-17 with @Cs|pg||
nt|gulyas: an easy game here - some might try 6@C and succeed, but its not easy to bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: or 11+ 3suiter singleton @d|pg||
nt|jkotor: dla Polaków: Adam powiedzia³ Bertheau, ¿e ma 4333|pg||

nt|yuval10: all roads to 3NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Hi Jack|pg||
nt|brolucius: The defenders took their @DA and declarer broached trumps with low to the queen and king, followed by the overruff.|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: nice one|pg||
nt|andyv:  in OR, S overcalled 2@h and EW played 2@S|pg||
nt|andyv:  I had Adam sign it but he fell asleep|pg||
nt|xenya: how can Hofta bid 6 without  knowing about the @C support?|pg||

nt|xenya: AKxx?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 2@D 2-way xyz?|pg||
nt|bagman: Italians are known to bid slams without 2 aces but I think that this generation uses RKCB as routine|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2way checkback, yes|pg||
nt|brolucius: The old 2-ace-missing system was so that opponents did at least have a chance of beating them.|pg||
nt|hedyg: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/May/OpenTeams/italy/duboin-sementa.pdf|pg||
nt|bagman: And indeed in Stockholm they did|pg||
nt|bagman: West is going to make a try|pg||
nt|Walddk2: As we see, 4@S can be defeated on best defence|pg||
nt|hedyg: over 2@d they bid up the line, i.e. with 4@Hs he would show those first|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Heart lead ruffed, diamond to the ace, heart ruff, and @SA|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, a heart is a plausible lead. It would stand out if West had actually bid hearts, since East has shown a balanced hand.|pg||
nt|sharkey: Even with a @C back goes down|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes S gets a 2nd chance to find the right return|pg||
nt|bagman: No, but N gets the ruff|pg||
nt|brolucius: If North is leading a heart, expecting it to be ruffed, he should lead a suit-preference card.|pg||
nt|bagman: On club return W probably tries to ditch the diamond|pg||
nt|hedyg: but N has no indication of 4 cards in @H in W|pg||
nt|brolucius: Learned kibitzers claim that it is OBVIOUS to play in no-trumps.|pg||
nt|sharkey: rite - so far W has only shown @S so not obvious to lead @H for ruff|pg||
nt|marlowepi: another cheesy takeout double, though at the colours fairly normal|pg||
nt|sybarra: remember these are seniors not juniors  |pg||
nt|hedyg: 10@s for free|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: This is possibly the longest I ever saw Duboin take to lead lol|pg||
nt|hedyg: he knows he is leading into a double stopper|pg||
nt|mdgraham: might reach 6@C here|pg||
nt|drorp: Versace doubling at first, to show a better hand than 4@H directly, but this plan backfires|pg||
nt|april7: possible EW going overboard because both think  p has singleton @S|pg||
nt|athene: 4nt unusual, offering choice of minors|pg||
nt|toral5: @D guess 4 an ot|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Well, the right combination of 14 counts will produce a slam|pg||
nt|toral5: thts true.both dont think they ll even explore on a semi wk 1nt aftr a texas auction|pg||
nt|toral5: but i meant.NOT both|pg||
nt|rhelle: I thought Flannery was forbidden in Europe|pg||
nt|toral5: this wd be beaten|pg||
nt|robinswr: would allow you to buy it at 4hearts|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Is he not Irish?|pg||
nt|jillan:  west knows he can eat most of his @S and STILL the slam is good :)|pg||
nt|fokal: mais 4@c va les pousser|pg||
nt|fokal: :s|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahri: for previous board, spec correctly pointed out that if spades are 2-1 you are safe as long as diamonds are 5-2 or 4-3 :). anyway, to this board...|pg||

nt|mdgraham: 2NT=good heart raise. |pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: sry Tez|pg||
nt|paulg:  i played against them last Sunday in their final practice match and Wilkinson had the same hand|pg||

nt|bagman: EW can also make 4@H with good spade guess|pg||
nt|rv: I am told 2n is GF relay|pg||
nt|april7: X of 3 @S is not very helpful|pg||
nt|athene: quite aggressive with exactly the wrong number of spades|pg||
nt|barnets: dec can make 6@S by setting up hearts and dropping the @SQ not too likely|pg||
nt|peachy: Now this is a variation of Puppet I am not familiar with, 3H|pg||
nt|fokal: oh !|pg||
nt|yvesj49: houlà|pg||
nt|fokal: impressionant|pg||
pc|dT|nt|brgpro: 2NT=GF bal. |pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: lol, not surprised with the amount of Mafia Wars he plays on FB|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: harfouche tries to make up for board 5. Sadly, this isnt the layout to do it|pg||
nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
nt|brolucius: 4@H would have bought it. Another instructive bidding hand.|pg||
nt|barnets: and so THEN the breaks are good and he will make it|pg||
nt|andyv:  with all the intermediates, do you think W has an invite with her 8 count, Barbara?|pg||
nt|babs59: I wouldn't|pg||
nt|mgchat: héhéhé ca va faire du bien|pg||
pc|d3|nt|athene: 3-3 diamonds and the double club stop mean this won't take too long|pg||
nt|sybarra: do they play this as a puppet sequence.  looks like it |pg||
nt|bjacobs: Looks like it, in an unusual setting|pg||
nt|mdgraham: actually there was no guess in 6@D - two unavoidable losers at least |pg||
nt|bagman: N is likely to lead a heart whether W bids hearts or not; just for a different reason|pg||
nt|lesniak: 3 pik=krotkosc- ale nie jestem pewien czy obaj tak mysla|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: 1@C - 1S - 2D - pas pas pas Nie gra pan odwrotk¹? gram ale nie w tej sekwencji|pg||

nt|petergill: North cannot be accused of lack of courage!|pg||
nt|Gerben42: I guess OK with @D3-3|pg||
nt|bagman: 4@S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@H is strong, natural; I think 4@H and 5+@C|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: something went wrong then :(|pg||
nt|rv: 3@h is natural and 4@d is cue in support of @hs|pg||
nt|toral5: they will negotiate the @D ruff here|pg||
pc|dA|nt|jtr: Then a @d ruff for 2 down|pg||
nt|othered1: Was east's double simply negative or was it specific to @S?|pg||
nt|jbgood: no insurance taken out|pg||
nt|rodvenn: well bid by charlsen|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am not sure Madala's approach was right tactically|pg||
nt|fabsayc: or rather bid in such a way as hard to judge if making|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes|pg||
nt|pasker: I think W may have been able to put Madala to a trump guess on that deal as @C weakness was marked|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Madala took all 13 by dropping @HQ, 11 IMPs to Italy|pg||
nt|bagman: EW like to sniff every possible slam. Sometimes that might give too much info for the defense|pg||
nt|snetram:  Szwedom zabierze to siedem okrÄÅ¼eÅ i wiele potu|pg||
nt|schtsch: i haven't slept much :)|pg||
nt|frululu: only low @H lead can set it|pg||

nt|ppiglett: Tough lead|pg||
nt|toral5: now making i guess|pg||
nt|yuval10: need small @h lead otherwise @h's are blocked|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: 3@H showed @S or ... I couldn't hear the ... though|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Sorry|pg||
nt|yuval10: @s's or no @s's|pg||
nt|yuval10: 3@s from W was 4 cards @s|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: That is the question!|pg||
nt|yuval10: lol 3@h can be either way|pg||
nt|haans: W has 2 hearts|pg||
nt|haans: nice make|pg||
nt|toral5: wd ve loved the auction 1@H-pp-dbl:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: If you're talking about Txx KQxxx KQxx x, I don't think that was that bad a hand|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|brgpro: he didnt show his @s at all|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: Cashout for an OT here? @SJxx is fortunate :)|pg||
nt|jtr: Communications a little awkward here|pg||
nt|jtr: But clearing the @ss seems right as you say|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Yesterday there was a similar auction where several Italian kibs claimed they don't play Puppet over 2@D openings|pg||
nt|lesniak: w trej chwili dojscie do wielikana graniczy z cudem|pg||
nt|antoniz: lol|pg||
nt|schtsch: ouch|pg||
nt|athene: i am surprised versace didn't just bid 4@H over 3@S|pg||
nt|jillan:  promises 1 or 4 aces|pg||
nt|peachy: where I play, 3H means "4-card spades, no 4-card hearts", but Barel-Zack have different agreements|pg||
pc|hA|nt|hedyg: i think it showed 4@s|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This one is not too trivial to play at all|pg||
nt|hedyg: i dont know...a hand that has NOTHING outside the @ss.....|pg||
nt|capercliff: what else Hedy? pass?|pg||
nt|hedyg: that doesnt go as a 1@s opening bid in 1st seat vuln for me|pg||
nt|hedyg: too strong for a weak 2?|pg||
nt|capercliff: yes|pg||
nt|hedyg: you need a lot to make game, if pd cannot bid over a weak 2 i am not going anywhere|pg||
nt|capercliff: duck 2 @c and down 3|pg||
nt|hedyg: Bocchi found the @H lead in OR|pg||
nt|hedyg: he can make this|pg||
nt|iain sime: Should survive.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5@H also makes|pg||
nt|hedyg: must get @hs right|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, very fortunate.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Impossible to go wrong, really|pg||
nt|stc: very good decision by Mossop|pg||
nt|athene: now he knows the spade suit is dead|pg||
nt|athene: but there aren't really any fresh woods and pastures new that look particularly promising|pg||
nt|jkotor: :)|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@C - 1@D - 1@h would have been forcing, so 2@H is very strong and natural|pg||
nt|haans: maybe 3@D as trf to 3nt|pg||
pc|h8|nt|tez: nice lead|pg||
nt|daman: double partscore swing for Serbia on Board 4|pg||
nt|andyv:  quite a lead|pg||
nt|lesniak: chyba ze czegos nie zauwazylem|pg||
nt|koksoy: they  will  play  4@H|pg||
nt|rv: maybe South's 3@c showed @s with possibly max hand|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Bocchi obviously not expecting too much for the 1@H overcall|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: no it was another match on my way here|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Ah|pg||
nt|viren169: That would not have been nice!|pg||
nt|viren169: probably hold declarer to 3 tricks for +1100|pg||
pc|h7|nt|hedyg: 4 or 5|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's a miracle that a diamond stands up after the support, and yet they can't beat it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So there is something wrong with Madala's judgement in my opinion|pg||
nt|hedyg: and also got the @c ruff|pg||
nt|Walddk2: David's point is valid. *IF* North thinks he can give partner5 a heart ruff on lead, he should also leader a high card in order to show preference for the higher suit, diamonds|pg||
nt|brolucius: South has shown big black two-suiter, so cannot hold all three hearts.|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: czy B-N graj¹ w tej chwili w Tunezji?|pg||
nt|koksoy: it  needs  carefull  play...  but cards lie  friendly for  the  declearer|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, but can't do without @SA if they lead a trump and another when in with a club. QJ are wasted but not the ace|pg||
nt|jillan:  I said MOST of his spades  :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: well done|pg||
nt|jillan:  they should lead atrump wityh this auction I think|pg||
nt|jillan:  same contract in the other room|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: No lead...|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: And Bocchi and Berthea took the dummy and they just accepted =|pg||
nt|peachy: no, 3D shows 1 or both 4-card majors, no 5 card major|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|brolucius: Hi to the kibitzers!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Oh I see|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good morning David|pg||
nt|iceblue: 2NT is nat fg, It is very puplar in china|pg||
nt|brolucius: Win with the @HA, clear the spades (if there is a loser) and the defenders would then have to play a club to give you any entry problem.|pg||
nt|lesniak: w polsce nie stosuje sie odpowiedzi na Blackwooda pokazujace renons- szkoda|pg||
nt|bagman: 4@H makes now easily but generally this kind of contract can be quite delicate because of the misfit. It cannot stand bad breaks|pg||
nt|petergill: 6@C is a good contract, but both finesses fail|pg||
nt|rv: possibly 4@s is kickback asking for key cards in @hs and South's 5@c shows 1 key|pg||
nt|tokay1975: yes clubs split nicely|pg||
nt|fokal: je ne pensais qu'Ouest passerait , j'avais l'impression que son partenaire avait montrer 6@s|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ryskiel_: a jak podobala by siê sekwencja 2@C-3@C-3@D-3@H itd?|pg||
nt|mamos: looking at all four hands  this looks straightforward enough|pg||
nt|toral5: 1 imp at stake here aftr the open room result:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: This is the second time since I've started operating that there was a claim for = without a lead. Both of the times were during this tournament|pg||
nt|haans: sry did mean 3@H as trf|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ryskiel_: sorry 2@H -  3@C  mialo byæ|pg||
nt|babs59: there's no real source of tricks - make the clubs QJ10xx and yes I would |pg||
nt|petergill: 3@C showed 3+ card support|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: N has shown @H+@D|pg||
nt|cumino: I Think a misundarstanding. 2@c >>2NT should be 55 or @S@D or @H@D|pg||
nt|rv: I am completely lost now and will stop guessing|pg||
nt|haans: but leave it|pg||
pc|c7|nt|mdgraham: according to the CC, 3@c is Stayman|pg||
nt|hedyg: by Zivkovic|pg||
nt|bagman: The lead hurts more declarer's nerves than the contract|pg||
nt|athene: but italian style is always double to show a good hand, almost irrespective of distribution|pg||
nt|peachy: N should have overtaken, did he not overtale Bas?|pg||
nt|peachy: overtake|pg||
nt|haans: @H8 made 3nt easy make|pg||
nt|peachy: hmm, either way, this now makes|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I didn't see him overtake, of course I might've missed something|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: We won't know till either plays a card :)|pg||
nt|peachy: small heart lead would have been best, but I cant really blame the Q, having QJ9xxx|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|capercliff: he should have taken time on this one however, it was much better to play on @c's before playing a @s|pg||
nt|capercliff: he may even had made it|pg||
nt|henryb:  still one down, as he cannot untangle tricks|pg||
nt|capercliff: only 1 Henry?|pg||
nt|henryb:  Isner and Mahut now at 61-60|pg||
nt|paulg:  yes, who worries about (the number of) undertricks when non-vul |pg||
nt|hedyg: wow|pg||
nt|hedyg: they will play for ever!|pg||
nt|paulg:  more importantly, for some, Italy are still 0-1|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  no, I meant that even playing clubs first declarer would be down one|pg||
nt|capercliff: I was chatting with Roland last night, he was saying he might walk down to watch. This was at 56-56, thought he may get anothre hour of it:)|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer has quite safe 10 tricks by drawing trumps and giving away 2 clubs and a diamond|pg||
nt|Gerben42: @D ruff for 800|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: lol|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Nystrom showed his hand without a lead|pg||
nt|jkotor: 3@d = krótkoæ 8-10zz    zz: a=3, k=2, d=1|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Nope :)|pg||
nt|fokal: tout dépend de la signification de 2 @c|pg||
nt|besbes: c etait bien de declarer apres le passe en est|pg||
nt|fokal: peut etre du @h et du @s|pg||
pc|sA|nt|xenya: here, at any rate, it has proved to be wrong |pg||
nt|bagman: Now N is interested to know if 3@H shows suit or just strength|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Otherwise South will not know if he should lead a club or a diamond|pg||
nt|marlowepi: best lead for NS. looks like a snoring hand, but the double increasing likelihood of bad breaks in key suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nothing you could have done if he had|pg||
nt|petergill: Normal contract at both tables, well bid, unlucky , assuming no @h lead|pg||
pc|s8|nt|mdgraham: 3@d/@H=transfers|pg||
nt|bjacobs: A simple approach is to just hope @HQ drops doubleton|pg||
nt|hedyg: hmm|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The point is moot now, so much for science|pg||
nt|hedyg: here N had the info and did not find the @H lead|pg||
nt|sharkey: Not their day - that was yesterday......|pg||
nt|athene: if north had a huge heart or diamond suit he might have bid it instead of 2@S perhaps|pg||
nt|snetram:  okazuje siÄ Å¼e sztucznie teÅ¼ moÅ¼na|pg||
nt|jkotor: mam dobre wpomaganie od Szwedów na priv|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: The lead wasn't really @SQ, there was no lead|pg||
nt|petergill: There is a silly double dummy line to make, which will not happen|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Possibly a misunderstanding of the meaning of 4@D|pg||
nt|rv: 5@h/5n are last making contracts|pg||
nt|cumino: Yes 4@D nat for Manara|pg||
nt|rv: you need lots of practise playing complicated relay based systems, otherwise you tend to lose more than you gain by such disasters|pg||
nt|viren169: East may have responded 1@S to make matters worse!|pg||
nt|haans: on @D dcl sort of sqz|pg||
pc|s7|nt|sybarra: but with the 3 @S bid,  looks like puppet |pg||
nt|Walddk2: What do you think, do the players from the "lesser" nations enjoy playing against Italy or do they fear it, especially when they are on vugraph?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if I read it right|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Both|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I think both as well|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I saw a Serbian player take the match card with the countries and player names yesterday :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: there is a lot of pressure when you are on Vugraph |pg||
nt|mbruun: Possible push for Lithuania. Ceasefire|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Enormous pressure.  They would surely MUCH prefer to play the Italians in a small private room with no one watching|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: My first and only match on BBO was a disaster, it was against Belgium :(|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I would guess that they would be up for it. Lithuanians are a fiercely proud people |pg||
nt|bjacobs: This is a really complex position|pg||
nt|bjacobs: One possibility for Duboin is to ruff a club, then plan to discard a spade on the 4th club, then ruff a spade - finally the heart finesse|pg||
nt|bagman: he can discard one of the diamonds on the @SQ|pg||
nt|andyv:  E could see 10 tricks if @hs broke|pg||
nt|andyv:  now he has to decide how to tackle the @d and @c suits|pg||
nt|bagman: If trumps were 4-0, declarer needs some luck elsewhere|pg||
nt|bagman: He's safe to draw the last trump and establis a trick in clubs |pg||
nt|koksoy: he  may  try  ruffing 2  clubs|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer is afraid of having one of the diamond winners ruffed.|pg||
nt|athene: south is presumably wondering whether his partner has the @DK|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|bagman: Now declarer goes up and starts trumps|pg||
nt|bagman: no need to guess|pg||
nt|petergill: Usually it's better to set up the side suit first, on hands like this one in 5@HX|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good afternoon to Paul Gipson|pg||
nt|corplaw: another pickup for croatia on club guess|pg||
pc|h2|nt|andyv:  when things go bad....|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|hedyg: Bocchi had no info|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, that too.|pg||
nt|andyv:  vul vs. none, you need about 42-44% chance of making game to bid it in mp.|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I am sorry, I lost the play here|pg||
nt|ziff:  Yes. Ruff two @Ds, cash 2 @S, throw in South with the last @C|pg||
nt|athene: now declarer, having stolen a diamond, will crossruff, i guess|pg||
nt|toral5: @C are nicely placed for lauria|pg||
pc|hT|nt|athene: yes, the multi allowed EW to say their piece at a lower level and then give up |pg||
nt|paulg:  Hi everyone|pg||
nt|robinswr: only reason it makes|pg||
nt|toral5: so as expected italy gained 7 on brd 2 stopping wel in a @S partial|pg||
nt|ppiglett: No need for club. with Diamond A onside - now cold - missed opportunity for Holland|pg||
nt|toral5: will versace bid 5@H at this vul with 1/2 @S losers?|pg||
nt|ppiglett: excuse me - Netherlands|pg||
nt|robinswr: needs one more trick |pg||
nt|toral5: i think @S ace wd not ve gained|pg||
nt|robinswr: he has 7 tricks and needs either the q of spades dropping or the QJ of clubs dropping|pg||
nt|toral5: this can turn out to be a huge brd for italy if 4s is allowed to play in the other room|pg||
pc|c8|nt|bjacobs: Or even discard two spades on two clubs?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: An interesting expansion of the basic plan|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If it's true what you are saying, the Italians have an advantage when they buy a vugraph box for the entire tournament. Everyone is forced to play against them on vugraph|pg||
nt|mbruun: They have many advantages, the Vu-graph, their system, their cardplay. |pg||
nt|bjacobs: This play is fraught as well - if South is 3-3-4-3, he will eventually be able to overruff dummy|pg||
nt|mamos: yes setting up Clubs may be harder |pg||
nt|frululu: by ouch y mean a good score in american football ? |pg||
nt|schtsch: don't need it|pg||
nt|corplaw: or spade trick :)|pg||
nt|robinswr: does south have AQ2 of spades?|pg||
nt|robinswr: or AQ|pg||
nt|robinswr: unlikely to be a singleton|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Good play from Simon - put Lauria to a guess in a free position|pg||
nt|toral5: lauria needs @D ace right 2 make this|pg||
nt|robinswr: would he lead from the queen in this situation|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Would de Wijs have bid 4@S on T987xxx?|pg||
nt|robinswr: 7-card suits are worth bidding|pg||
nt|mdgraham: get the clubs right, and 5@Hx is 500 I think|pg||
nt|toral5: if west doesnt cash out,@H ace ll b discarded|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|koksoy: that  is  @C A  and ruff  @H Q  THEN|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Another win for 4th best from your longest and strongest|pg||
pc|d6|nt|hedyg: hmmm he might try to disc the @d now?|pg||
nt|petergill: East is endplayed after he ruffs the @D and has to accept 800 instead of 1100  - he will try a low club from his king |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not easy to play that trump suit for 1 loser|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: after 46 in big swings this will be a welcome score for the Swiss ladies|pg||
pc|cA|nt|tez: @d2 is suit pereferance|pg||
nt|bjacobs: She!  |pg||
nt|petergill: At the other table, Norberto Bocchi did not bid as boldly as Janis Ozols|pg||
nt|barnets: nice play|pg||
nt|barnets: gives north a dilemma|pg||
nt|petergill: Duboin, anticipating the endplay, works out that it's better to play a club from his side than to give partner the @d ruff. Classy, as long as it doesn't backfire.|pg||
nt|ziff:  Probably doesn t work, even, as everything is blocked afterwards|pg||
nt|cumino: Normally on 2@C the relay is 2@D, 2NT is for two switers FG, no support in @C|pg||
mc|8|nt|Walddk2: An additional advantage then, as if they need more|pg||
nt|Gerben42: thats impressive bridging|pg||

nt|athene: short club with transfer responses, so 1@S from north|pg||
nt|jillan:  they are playing it at the other table.....|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Yes, Nystrom went to the bathroom and Bertheau picked up his cards and showed them to Bocchi who shrugged|pg||
nt|mdgraham: however, who needs that sort of guess - and yet the oppo might go 5@s which you have a chance of defeating|pg||

nt|andyv:  if you dbl and take the same tricks, it's 14 imps... but, if you warn declarer of the suit break and it goes down only 1 (8 imps) or makes 14 imps against you... not a good return for your dbl|pg||

nt|petergill: "heavies"|pg||
nt|petergill: so Latvia have already played many of the top teams and are doing well to be in the top half of the field|pg||

nt|mdgraham: it's a bit of a point. In those kinds of position, do you mind conceding 800 against a vul game if every so often you get a chance of going plus if the oppo misguess|pg||
nt|haans: even with @CA lead boring hand|pg||
nt|viren169: With the diamonds 3-3 and K of spades right there are 10 tricks available for Declarer|pg||
mb|r!|nt|brolucius: If it had been, the defender would have to surrender the contract, whether he rose with the ace or not.|pg||
nt|othered1: on @D lead @H is 5 or 7|pg||

nt|bagman: This is  too much for Versace to handle|pg||
nt|vasmar: 4 losers|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Simpson claiming he has a minimum|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N hoping S has something like Axx of spades and short clubs|pg||
nt|marlowepi: agree he has a minimum 3S bid:)|pg||
nt|stc: anyway, in bridge you don't even need a to be citizen to represent a country...|pg||
nt|rnmalik: P has passed 1@H, imo defend NT.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: "Is there a squeeze for the overtrick", the Danish declarer asked|pg||
nt|Walddk2: "Yes", replied the Finn|pg||
nt|jillan:  hahaha, played the hand? acutally as in PLAYED?|pg||
nt|idc: The NS CC is ... not as clear as it might be|pg||
nt|yuval10: after 8 boards only|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: MIght not be flat|pg||
nt|bagman: a heart now and declarer might settle for his 9 tops|pg||
nt|brolucius: If Slovakia finish in the bottom half of the table, Italy's (magnificent) score from this match will count for nothing. You only carry over your scores against qualifying teams.|pg||
nt|sharkey: this reminds me of when we got a WO in a Pairs tournament after 5 rounds - finally achieving a Plus round|pg||
nt|bagman: or S might duck the @HJ and get 10 tricks by setting up the clubs|pg||
nt|hedyg: they are 14th so far|pg||
nt|brolucius: Respectable with such a small population.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Anyway, if you are going to have a string of awful boards, best to group them together in just one match.|pg||
nt|mamos: North has been conservative too|pg||
nt|barnets: e/w can make  3@C here|pg||
nt|ziff:  Various kibitzers have improved on my line by drawing only two trump before playing the 3rd @S. This seems to work, but nobody plays that way without mirrors in the room|pg||
nt|schtsch: and bocchi will pass it if it happens|pg||

nt|Walddk2: No service|pg||

nt|athene: 3@S was alerted - did it show specifically two spades?|pg||

nt|Walddk2: It's a true story|pg||
nt|jillan:  but maybe I have forgotten it.... running Alzheimer you know :)|pg||
nt|jillan:  I do believe you. Could easily have happened in the Nordic|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The other two players were a bit surprised when they came back and put the cards back in the wallet|pg||
pc|dA|nt|brgpro: well, he has 4@s as well,....so, opps can't have a cheap contract here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Spain-Belgium must be playing football instead of bridge. The score is 1-0 after 5 boards|pg||
nt|rv: I might have led @HA from East hand hoping for stiff honor|pg||
nt|drorp: now @C, A@S, and 4th @C|pg||
nt|drorp: not hard|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Yuval Yener|pg||
nt|peachy: NS did it as NS|pg||
nt|peachy: in the other room,|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|brolucius: North would rarely lead the @HA from a combination such as A-Q-x, but here the bidding had suggested that neither East nor West held a heart control.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No, just a permanent resident for some time|pg||
nt|cicus: I expected E to try some club ruffs|pg||
nt|hedyg: once pd showed the rounded suits..|pg||
nt|athene: no reason for versace to jump in with a big spade first round anyway, even if declarer really does have the queen|pg||

nt|atabey: would be a good auction if K of @h was offside with a @d lead|pg||

nt|capercliff: not sure even a @c lead would beat it tho?|pg||
nt|snetram:  co powinno pokazywaÄ renons|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Hand over they said|pg||
nt|jillan:  same contract in both rooms|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|brgpro: normal|pg||
nt|brolucius: West did hold a singleton heart, in fact, but chose not to cue-bid it because of the general minimum nature of his hand.|pg||
nt|bagman: South needs to return a club after taking the @CA|pg||
nt|petergill: Yes, there's a lack of entries to dummy|pg||

nt|henryb:  I have to leave you for Chicago|pg||
nt|hedyg: bye Henry, ty|pg||

nt|capercliff: cu Henry, thanks|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Awww Henry|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Thanks Henry, enjoy :)|pg||
nt|paulg:  Piper/Wilkinson have an excellent attitude and memories like goldfish ... a bad score never fazes them|pg||
nt|bagman: ducking twice is fatal|pg||
nt|bagman: Time to count decarer's tricks|pg||
nt|andyv:  his choices would appear limited... either a club or a club or a club|pg||
nt|bagman: Nothing to do if partner hasn't go a trump trick|pg||
nt|brolucius: You can measure the strength of a bridge player by counting the countries in the world that would welcome the player into their national team.|pg||

nt|sybarra: wonderful system |pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: OK, someting is terribly wrong here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but even with 4 card majors 1S is somewhat questionable, and the double a bit more so holding 3 clubs |pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Declarer ran the hearts then played a small @S|pg||
nt|babs59: regarding last board, many people move with 8 HCP opposite a 15-17 NT|pg||
nt|ppiglett: It just has - 2+2 - claim|pg||
nt|toral5: as long as he plays @H frm dummy|pg||
pc|c7|nt|bagman: Now Sementa needs to dicard the clubs and see what happens|pg||
nt|brolucius: The Smith peter is a signal, normally used only in no-trumps. You play high or low on declarer's first suit (when a count signal is not needed) to say something about how much you ...|pg||

pc|d2|nt|barnets: while there appears only 4 losers the entries are tough |pg||

nt|athene: giving up a tempo with the club could have been fatal|pg||
pc|s7|nt|brolucius: There is a general consensus that you should always cue-bid an ace, provided it does not raise the level of the contract. With a second-round control, you can take a view and ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: decline to cue-bid if you are not suitable for a slam. |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Why would you not be suitable for slam with five controls?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Indeed. I would have bid 4@H.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Particularly as East had not bid that suit.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I am asked about controls. The ace is worth two, the king one control|pg||
nt|Walddk4: So AAK = five|pg||
nt|brolucius: It's a slight problem with auctions that have become game-forcing. The needs to cue-bid controls and to show slam suitability clash somewhat.|pg||
nt|bagman: Pressure|pg||
nt|koksoy: 4@H  need  some  effort|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|bagman: Sementa is probably especially happy because defending at 2 level with void vs Q9xxx is always quite risky|pg||

nt|atabey: that was a strong hand over 2@h|pg||
nt|tez: other table playing 6|pg||
nt|othered1: i think 6@H was right on last hand, given far less than high likelihood of @D lead.|pg||
nt|andyv:  not sure what W dbld on unless it was to stop pd from bidding|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: NS may have missed chance of +800 ..but got +850  :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Are you saying Pass is forcing? :P|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So 13 IMPs to Norway on board 6|pg||
nt|rodvenn: if East had had the spade q, he would have bid more strongly|pg||
nt|bagman: This looks like a flat 4@H with an overtrick|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: After 7 compared boards a 60 IMP lead would be 25-0 with 9 IMPs to spare|pg||
nt|sybarra: do we have the right bd?|pg||
nt|mamos: i think North is worth 3@h if South had rebid 2@D so not quite sure what has happened here|pg||
nt|iain sime: Italy were losing 12 imps anyway so the lead only cost two more.|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I think, by David's measure, Zia must be the best player in the world, for who wouldn't want him on their team?|pg||
nt|brolucius: A diamond lead seems to look right from that East hand.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, he would pick up the whole world.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Same with Meckstroth and Rodwell, and the great Italians.|pg||
nt|petergill: As we are seeing, 3@H can be beaten |pg||
nt|Gerben42: +80 almost never feels bad|pg||
nt|Gerben42: EW turn again|pg||
nt|petergill: To make 2@H, you have to cross to @SQ to lead a heart up, then duck a heart|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 5@D the top spot|pg||
nt|petergill: In 1@H, North's play was just fine, was the safest way to play 1@H|pg||
nt|gulyas: so, a push as expected|pg||
nt|andyv:  and Bulgaria struck back with a 12 imp swing when 3N was set on board 4|pg||

nt|schtsch: over hte screen of course|pg||
nt|corplaw: good 6S contract|pg||
nt|drorp: bad luck for portugal i think, transferring is normally percentage with those type of hands|pg||

nt|hedyg: Open one browser window per table|pg||
nt|bagman: He probably knew but was considering that the contract cannot go down unless he can cash another @H trick|pg||
nt|mamos: though I dont play 4 card majors  I dont think its the system thats gone wrong here |pg||
nt|marlowepi: the description of the play siuggests a NT contract, probably N bid 2N over 2S|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: It was the right board, I just entered the wrong contract, my apologies|pg||
nt|schtsch: his head is too big to fit through the screen hole|pg||
nt|wstuart: I wonder if they know they are generating more action than normal?|pg||

nt|koksoy: so  as  you  said  everyone  could be happy|pg||
nt|babs59: first blood to Italy who stopped in 3@C on board 4|pg||
nt|mdgraham: not only is it very small (although you can ramp up the size) but there is a lot of it|pg||
mb|1N|nt|andyv:  when it goes pass pass... yes your pass is now forcing... and no one else can bid:)|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, and he knew spades were 3-3|pg||
nt|xenya: 2@S?|pg||
nt|bagman: Here it is very hard to misguess something in the play|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer will play diamonds before spades, hoping to set up a spade discard on the @DK-Q.|pg||

nt|hedyg: hmm did he duck the 2nd @d?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I asked him after the claim and he said 9|pg||

nt|petergill: 3@S = minors|pg||

mb|p|nt|pasker: they need to avoid 3NT on this deal|pg||
nt|Gerben42: i guess 5@D will be reached soon|pg||
nt|andyv:  this should wind up in 3N|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: You know what they say about @D :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: always a good topic for debate about whether 1NT should be take-out or natural here |pg||
pc|h5|nt|mdgraham: 2NT=19-23 balanced|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If you must jump to 2NT now, I think you have lost the advantage of opening 1@C|pg||
nt|hedyg: must have (reasonably) ducked the 2nd @d|pg||
nt|hedyg: oh|pg||
nt|hedyg: well then he had 10 tricks|pg||
nt|stc: NS may defend in 5@d|pg||
nt|iain sime: May not find spades if North bounces.|pg||

nt|othered1: A possible line on last h and is to cash @HA then try to get @D discard on 4th @S.  I don't think that's best, however.|pg||
nt|tez: kandemir led @d at the other table..interesting now|pg||

nt|gulyas: unless its mp scoring, where anything goes|pg||
nt|hedyg: A@H and small @D?|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can easily win the top two trumps and crossruff in diamonds and spades|pg||
nt|skorchev: hi all|pg||
nt|mdgraham: when people open with 10 and respond with 3 you sometimes need a natural NT bid|pg||

nt|andyv:  http://bit.ly/cLqzVV|pg||
nt|capercliff: if he went up with the K then they need to give him 10 tricks?|pg||
nt|bagman: It is possible that E leads a club and then a spade back forces declarer to go up|pg||
nt|bagman: He'll do fine with a diamond lead|pg||
nt|bagman: It's hard to locate a weakness in partner's 4 card suit|pg||
nt|andyv:  a lot riding on the opening lead|pg||
nt|pasker: true lauria might not lead a @S|pg||
nt|brolucius: Take-out double a good move from West - suggests spades but does not go past 3@H.|pg||
nt|petergill: 5@D plays better than 3NT|pg||
nt|barnets: not so safe|pg||
nt|barnets: with bad club break|pg||
nt|toral5: on a @C lead say he plays @S in dummy and leads a @H|pg||
nt|robinswr: usually right to lead heart here|pg||
nt|robinswr: maybe even the king|pg||
nt|toral5: can shorten ONLY once whn in with @H ace|pg||
nt|toral5: he ll end up getting 5@S+4@H+1@C|pg||
nt|tokay1975: this is a push probably|pg||
nt|milton_se: preferred 2NT|pg||
nt|toral5: this is a non yawner.courtesy 3-1 @C|pg||
pc|s4|nt|othered1: assuming @D lead, of course|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Huge opportunity here|pg||
nt|hedyg: except if he claims 9, yes|pg||
nt|hedyg: then it is his problem|pg||
nt|capercliff: hmm, 1@s not forcing here?|pg||
nt|bagman: does not force as he might have a heart loser|pg||
nt|bagman: so even in that case declarer takes the spade finesse|pg||
nt|sybarra: I see 8 tricks |pg||

nt|fabsayc: the idea is to offer a choice between 3nt and 4s|pg||

nt|iceblue: Zhou doest think it is 16HCP since of the stiff @HQ|pg||
nt|stc: 3@s(170) better the 5@dx-1 !|pg||
nt|stc: or even 140|pg||
nt|iain sime: Or minus 400 (3NT if a club lead)|pg||
nt|hedyg: in the mean time 10 more imps to Italy|pg||
nt|athene: with no overruff possible, he will end up making nine tricks|pg||
nt|skorchev: 3@H by South is either slam interest with @S fit or @S fit, balanced fit, intending to play 3nt/4@S|pg||
nt|skorchev: *balanced hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: you can use this idea over a 1NT opening|pg||
nt|bagman: Sementa has goodish spade intermediates and a fitting Q + singleton|pg||
nt|paulg:  from what I've seen, it is wrong to describe any Duboin as invitational ... it is just a transfer for Sementa to bid game|pg||
nt|koksoy: :)|pg||
nt|rv: Gabrielle's raise to 4@s seems to be very optimistic|pg||
nt|robinswr: declarer oftens has a singleton heart here|pg||

pc|cJ|nt|hedyg: nice selfcontrol by Assael|pg||

nt|bagman: yes|pg||
nt|hedyg: where 4@s was bid and made|pg||
nt|hedyg: on bd 7|pg||
nt|bagman: Sementa might duck this to keep multiple options|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Girls need a deck of cards... A @H to love a man, a @D to marry him, a @C to whack him in the head and a @S to bury him|pg||
nt|babs59: I hadn't heard that one before!|pg||

nt|viren169: What would you lead from West's hand?|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mbruun: Gutsy play|pg||

nt|capercliff: maybe they play it as limited|pg||

nt|paulg:  he is a little short of entries to do everything though|pg||
nt|koksoy: diamond  now|pg||
nt|schtsch: really? maybe he can count his honors?|pg||
nt|rv: this deal cries for a trump lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes and get partner in later with a diamond for her to play another trump|pg||
nt|drorp: Barbosa feels is AKJ642 is worth spade bids, so he'll have to play with a 6-0 fit, luckily everything is well for him so this can make 11 tricks|pg||

nt|robinswr: king of hearts would have been better just in case the jack was the queen|pg||

nt|toral5: ahh brd 6 turned out to be a PUSH|pg||
nt|rhelle: that is not unexpected|pg||
nt|rhelle: the problem is the lead; and when partner bids 4@s, he may well have done so on a partial @d fit|pg||
nt|othered1: But it's not ridiculous to reason that way.|pg||

nt|rhelle: so it's not easy to visualise a @d singleton|pg||
nt|toral5: once @C 9 appears he ll b forced to play ace 2nd time|pg||
nt|idc: The important thing is, Sapan doesn't have to say: FLAT GAME  :)|pg||
pc|cK|nt|gulyas: with Dumbovich in the driving seat, I would not be surprised at all:)|pg||
nt|gulyas: sry, its Gotthard|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Bocchi asking whether 1NT is natural or not|pg||
nt|ahri: hm seems board 7 was corrected to 2@hx-2 |pg||
nt|ahri: or I might have been blind|pg||
nt|athene: @SAK and a small one will work very nicely - if he chooses that|pg||
nt|toral5: if he is in a position to play few @H i think he can guess|pg||
nt|ritong: attention|pg||
pc|c3|nt|daman: this probably requires careful play     ergo the delay|pg||
nt|daman: USA  and England won their soccer matches|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: So Algeria and Slovakia are out of the Football World Cup? :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Sorry George, couldn't resist :)|pg||
nt|daman: I believe so|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I am being told Slovenia|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I was just testing George kibs :) Haha|pg||
nt|bagman: NS have probably promised both majors and clubs as the trick suit|pg||
nt|andyv:  nice method|pg||
nt|fabsayc: see my website for an explanation of this idea|pg||
nt|petergill: Making 3@S requires good guessing in @h and @C|pg||
nt|cumino: Even after A@h trump is normal|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I notice that our operator "stole" an ø :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: :) I saved it from the last time you sent it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Ah right|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: But it's not on the match sheet, too much of a match for the EBL computers, I suppose|pg||
nt|xenya: a small spade at trick 2 would hvae beaten 3@H, but how could W  know the Jack was singleton|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: (Only because the keyboards are set to English and aren't suitable for accents)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Jacob Røn was in the team when Denmark won the World Championships for juniors in 1998|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, I moved to England and I still have  æ  ø  å|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|fabsayc: under 50%|pg||
nt|Gerben42: it was a part of the Romex system, designed by Mexican top player George Rosenkrantz|pg||
nt|petergill: when a @D is led towards dummy, South needs to duck. Is this hard?|pg||
nt|lesniak: tak|pg||
nt|paulg:  if he ruffed two diamonds, then he'd need the club finesse for a heart pitch and doesn't have the entries for that ....|pg||
nt|paulg:  unless the defence helps!|pg||
nt|koksoy: now  he  may  crossruff|pg||
nt|bagman: This was helpful; now he can afford to ruff the diamonds |pg||
nt|toral5: haha idc:)|pg||
nt|yuval10: AK@d and @h to the 8 like the OR will do|pg||
nt|ritong: le flanc est plus facile a cartes ouvertes|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mbruun: Looks like a minirally of 1 IMP|pg||
nt|paulg:  i wonder if Wilkinson misread the auction and thought that East bid it|pg||
nt|bagman: now the rest is easy|pg||
nt|barnets: same contract same lead in the open|pg||
nt|babs59: entries are interesting this hand|pg||
nt|schtsch: of course, but his stopper is a bit tiny|pg||
nt|athene: but he might try for some sort of elopement|pg||
nt|lechcold: wygl¹da ¿e kolejne 5 impów zasili nasze konto|pg||
nt|toral5: k109 with north he is helpless|pg||
nt|tokay1975: israel turkey match 50 -6 after 9 boards so tournament gets more exited |pg||
pc|d4|nt|andyv:  finally a calm board for Lebanon|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe the 3 was attitude?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: When there are imps to be won, you have to go for it|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer did consider rising with the @SA... for about 0.0001 milliseconds.|pg||
nt|cicus: still no surprise|pg||
nt|gulyas: :)|pg||
nt|8252: ils doivent etre équipé de l'appel de smith : les petites cartes de Mari dénie une carte intéressante à @h|pg||
pc|dA|nt|hedyg: claim|pg||
nt|jkotor: Adam lavinthalowa³ trefle, wiêc jest na to czas|pg||
nt|rv: Swiss ladies have been kind not to double this contract as well, generally you get away with overbidding if opps don't have good trumps:)|pg||
nt|athene: just ruffing things in hand|pg||
nt|ritong: joli|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|jtr: Nicely played by Bocchi|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@H asked for a @H stopper|pg||
nt|bagman: Logical to lead a diamond|pg||
nt|vasmar: a potential plus for Cyprus|pg||
nt|petergill: Moment of truth|pg||
nt|petergill: Playing the opening bidder for @HA was reasonable but unlucky|pg||
pc|h9|nt|iain sime: Not sure about this line. the heart king was an entry.|pg||
nt|petergill: Very difficult play for South|pg||
nt|snetram:  jak powiedzieliÅmy, tak zrobiÅ|pg||
nt|babs59: even with a 'helpful' lead|pg||
nt|besbes: tres dur le petit @c est la seule indication|pg||
pc|h3|nt|bagman: I guess that this will played to the end|pg||
nt|andyv:  if Versace had somehow found a way to duck the @d, it would have put a lot of pressure on N|pg||
nt|ritong: très joli, même|pg||
pc|h2|nt|daman: for interested parties    http://www.cbc.ca/sports/soccer/fifaworldcup/features/story/2010/06/19/sp-wc-tiebreakers.html|pg||
nt|gulyas: crossruff time|pg||
nt|ziff:  That s what I meant with difficult, you want to bid only once, but the hand is very good if you hit a fit. If  not....|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|brgpro: after E has shown 3@s, he knows the @h aren't breaking....well, actually he hopes they wont break...|pg||
nt|lesniak: Adam - bo on chyba siedzi na E|pg||
nt|toral5: the software DID listen to my flat game cryies|pg||
pc|h6|nt|Vugraphznk: It seems the contract is indeed 4@S, I missed a part, sorry all|pg||
nt|hedyg: ahhhhh ok ty Bas|pg||
nt|jkotor: nie, chyba przekrêcili tylko jedno rozdanie|pg||
nt|snetram:  profesjonalna obrona - zawodowcy.|pg||

pc|hK|nt|jtr: They are playing 4@s at the other table i hear|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|hedyg: i agree|pg||
nt|toral5: 2nd @S i guess now|pg||
nt|toral5: this will be 9 tricks for lauria|pg||
nt|mdgraham: maybe he can in a minute or so|pg||
pc|h8|nt|lesniak: i tyle by bylo...|pg||
nt|snetram:  ale wymagaÅo koncentracji|pg||
nt|lesniak: tak|pg||
nt|viren169: sadly no entry to the long club for defense|pg||
pc|d9|nt|pasker: as pointed out by spec the 9@S is going to be good enough on a @S lead|pg||
nt|bagman: Ducking would have been double dummy play; imagine partner with AJxx(x)|pg||
nt|drorp: either way, he will make 10 tricks|pg||
pc|s8|nt|brgpro: that would be a quick one down, even without @h ruffs|pg||
nt|mamos: hoping for some clues or helpful discards|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer must be careful now in the trump suit. Yes, well played!|pg||
nt|mamos: pretty sure @H finesse is wrong now|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes too many @H's discards from W |pg||
nt|Gerben42: this will also test Madala|pg||
nt|petergill: Will be interesting to see what Madala does at other table|pg||
nt|petergill: Very tough play - the sort of play that the champions often find|pg||
nt|barnets: in the open declarer played a @D from hand at trcik 2 better I think and madala made a fine play of ducking his K|pg||
nt|petergill: Agustin Madala ducked, I am told|pg||
nt|idc: Of course, I missed the most important point as usual|pg||
pc|h7|nt|athene: declarer had no chance to set up the spades|pg||
nt|athene: as dummy was short of entries|pg||
nt|athene: but now he is running seriously short of tricks|pg||
nt|athene: even though west only has two obvious winners (@CA, trump)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: now 8, not 7|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W held his diamonds because N might have had diamond ace instead of heart ace|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N still has the chance of a defensive error earlier, i.e. E failing to unl;ock spade ten from QTxx|pg||
nt|marlowepi: then a diamond exit would see him home|pg||
pc|s3|nt|andyv:  yes...Lauria would have had to lead something other than the 5@d to give Versace a chance to duck|pg||
nt|vasmar: this is a disadvantage of leading low from 10xxx|pg||
nt|mgchat: 6 for us|pg||
pc|s7|nt|rv: Roland are these 2 teams in contention for medals?|pg||
nt|athene: the @SJ is definitely an error there|pg||
nt|athene: doesn't help to pin the nine|pg||
nt|athene: you have to play for singleton queen|pg||
nt|athene: since you are missing the seven as well|pg||
mc|6|nt|mamos: east not thinking???|pg||
nt|brolucius: He can give up a club for 9 tricks.|pg||
nt|hedyg: best play @s now and give 1@c|pg||

mb|p|nt|iceblue: Muiderberg 2@S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 13 IMPs to Italy on 7. The Italians found the defence against 3NT. @HQ to the ace and a diamond switch|pg||
nt|toral5: another 3nt coming up.this time for the dutch|pg||
mb|1S|nt|brgpro: 6@d needs @hA to be on...|pg||
nt|brolucius: That deal is worthy of another look afterwards. Very instructive that Bocchi established the spades before playing on trumps. |pg||
nt|brgpro: not that bad but hard to reach|pg||
nt|capercliff: oh i see:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: -2|pg||

nt|pasker: I'm not a big fan of the 4@H opening with a poorish suit and some defence|pg||
nt|pasker: but has worked out well enough here|pg||
nt|vasmar: first seat you mean|pg||
nt|andyv:  if that's all you have in your arsenal, you may as well use it|pg||
nt|bagman: W comes in with 4NT?|pg||
nt|andyv:  -500|pg||
nt|bagman: IT cannot be S thinking|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: W blocking out all sound now, hands over his eyes and fingers in his ears|pg||
nt|andyv:  but may talk N into bidding on|pg||
nt|bagman: over 4NT N can bid on with X|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I haven't even done a slamtease yet ;)|pg||
nt|hedyg: rofl|pg||
nt|barnets: it is better for dec to play th @D at trick 2 before the defense know what is going on|pg||
nt|petergill: Well deserved imps to Italy |pg||
nt|barnets: if the clubs are good they will always be good|pg||
nt|athene: but a pre-empt can do that to you|pg||
nt|athene: one area of the game where i am sure most pairs don't have enough methods is after a 3nt overcall of a pre-empt|pg||
nt|gulyas: 4@S makes more tricks - in fact, you  have to guess @Ss to to make 3NT at all|pg||
nt|athene: it can cover such a wide range of shapes and strengths, you need a lot of kit to investigate the best game or slam|pg||

nt|toral5: luks gets LOT of hcps|pg||

nt|haans: me 2|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: we all do|pg||
nt|viren169: 2@C here|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Spades and a minor, 5-5|pg||
nt|petergill: which makes East about a 9/17 chance of having @HA in my opinion, so it was a close guess in @H|pg||
nt|athene: and 1nt - 3nt - east didn't double for a spade lead and west didn't find @SKx lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They had 3 chances|pg||
nt|rhelle: 1NT = 12.5 - 15|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|andyv:  probably need a @c lead to stop 4@s|pg||
nt|bjacobs: German term|pg||
nt|petergill: Possibly, but at Trick 2 it seems natural to duck to retain your entry. At Trick 4, perhaps it seemed less clear?|pg||
nt|athene: 2@H rather than 3@H makes things much easier|pg||
nt|athene: now transfer and west will do something very enthusiastic|pg||
nt|athene: to show his monster support for spades|pg||
nt|gulyas: 6@S makes with good guesses, not likely to be bid tho|pg||
nt|cicus: still not an easy overcall, double is a sensible alternative|pg||
nt|athene: west wants to play game facing just five spades and a yarborough, pretty much|pg||
nt|lesniak: oczywiscie uzylibysmy innych przymiotnikow gdyby S mial K trefl|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: np :)|pg||
nt|paulg:  1@d promises 0 diamonds, not an ideal start to this hand|pg||
nt|bagman: Is N going to bury the @Hs|pg||
nt|andyv:  balancing with W hand ok in mp... but not great in imps.|pg||
nt|lechcold: witamy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: One can't find the lead from Kx of course, but Askgaard had another two opportunities|pg||
nt|athene: 2@S shows 4 spades and 6-card minor|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He ducked hearts twice and then it was all over|pg||
nt|milton_se: another 3NT|pg||

nt|fokal: @c 3-3 et le roi placé, A de @d placé D de @h seche|pg||
mb|3D|nt|Walddk4: A Dutch invention|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Google solves all|pg||
nt|bagman: nice result in the open room|pg||
nt|bagman: Difficult situation. 5m can go down a lot and there was no guarantees that 4@H makes|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: South correctly makes no move towards game. He expects that the deal is a mis-fit and his hearts will pull little weight with spades as trumps.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 3@C seems sadistic|pg||
nt|mdgraham: apart from translating the NASZ system....|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@S is the limit and even that is not cold|pg||
nt|bagman: NS can make 5@C|pg||
nt|paulg:  3@d looks like a mixed raise in spades|pg||
nt|paulg:  so 4-card support plus a good card or two|pg||
nt|bagman: Denning has more or less shown only his range without much info about his shape|pg||
nt|paulg:  Denning might bid four or five diamonds|pg||
nt|bagman: Now it's quite hard to recover from the start|pg||
nt|paulg:  i think 5@d |pg||
nt|paulg:  three major suit cards, fit with partner, excellent suit|pg||
nt|schtsch: no action from tesla, pity|pg||
nt|schtsch: wrong vulerability|pg||
nt|ahri: 2@c is GF|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: flat super accept|pg||
nt|athene: i can't see any reason for declarer to drop the @SK here|pg||
nt|april7: 2NT is Truscott I think, but E proposes 3NT|pg||
nt|drorp: Italians continue to bid aggrresivley, and unless Versace can find the stiff K@s, it won't work for them this time aswell|pg||
nt|athene: you might make 4@S even if you lose to the @SK - you won't make 3nt|pg||
nt|athene: in 4@S you might hold the losers to @SK, @HA, and @CA, throwing a club on a heart eventually|pg||
nt|athene: brave of declarer to play a second heart rather than hoping for 3-3 clubs|pg||
nt|athene: but i guess after the club lead he knew a 3-3 split was very unlikely|pg||
nt|athene: maybe he just operated on the principle "if west didn't lead a spade either of his first two opportunities, he won't lead one on his third" :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Blakset left for the bathroom, Duboin thinking|pg||
nt|athene: if EW are going to bid a slam, they had better put north on lead|pg||
nt|athene: since he isn't the one with the fairly obvious lead :)|pg||
nt|athene: i think if west ended up 6@H, north would lead a club|pg||
nt|Walddk2: At long last, Denmark on the board. 3@H went 1 down on 8 in the other room|pg||
nt|athene: probably EW in the other room play upside down count and west could read the @SJ as a singleton|pg||
nt|ppiglett: 3N for n/s unless E-W want to get involved and get Dbled|pg||
nt|mdgraham: once again the overcall on ace-ten-nine fifth|pg||
nt|fokal: quelle que soit la gingne choisie on devrait s'en sortir|pg||
nt|fokal: la ligne|pg||
mb|3H|nt|daman: tah dah|pg||
nt|bagman: They have loaded quite a lot into 1@D opening as their 2@C opening shows 6 or more|pg||
nt|athene: i guess EW aren't making a slam even if they escape the club lead, anyway|pg||
nt|athene: on this board|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Denied|pg||
nt|viren169: No fireworks here|pg||
mb|4D|nt|iceblue: 2NT shud be Lebensohl|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3NT?|pg||
nt|sybarra: does S pass?|pg||
nt|hedyg: not sure Versace was bidding 4@H freely|pg||
nt|hedyg: E bid 2@C in OR|pg||
nt|sharkey: Madala did not have a good match earlier today vs Norway but sure has reddemed himself in this match|pg||
nt|hedyg: and S doubled to show a good hand|pg||
nt|bagman: N might not make a move nv|pg||
nt|hedyg: Italy won 21:9 vs Norway|pg||
nt|hedyg: that looks pretty good to me|pg||
nt|brolucius: Incredible that the Italians should actually make two cue-bids on such values. Do they see a potential slam on every deal?|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - cud have been much more...|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4 VPs more?|pg||
nt|bagman: W should not bid to sac but to make (on this vulnerability)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But declarer can overtake spades when the 10 falls and should be OK in 3|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@H raise should include 4333 10 counts. |pg||
nt|lesniak: nasi grali 4 pik z kontra , dostali wist 3 razy trefl= ksiazka/ odwrot karo i buras niepotrzebnie wstawil K karo- w efekcie byl bez 2|pg||
nt|haans: shorter kibs+us|pg||
nt|toral5: is 2@C precision style?|pg||
nt|haans: yes|pg||
nt|ritong: je serais stupéfait de les voir au chelem|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: I don't get it - South passes 1@S, why would North then venture 3@C with that hand?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: South had no choice|pg||
nt|mdgraham: why 3@C facing a partner who passed 1@S?|pg||
nt|sybarra: another canape sequence here |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Lucky club position|pg||
nt|bagman: And now p p 5@C|pg||
mb|4H!|nt|capercliff: Piper is out for blood now|pg||
nt|dougdscsu: of course he was|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@H = "not forward-going", |pg||

nt|lesniak: w kara= zalezy co zrobi rozg i partner|pg||
nt|koksoy: 4nt  ?  now  to  choose  a  minor|pg||
nt|koksoy: he  thinks  wh  has  hearts?|pg||
nt|bagman: The problem with 4NT is that W gets a freeroll to X|pg||
nt|athene: a surprising choice from lauria there|pg||
nt|athene: now the scoreboard really is all square :)|pg||
nt|athene: thanks to bocchi taking a good view not to transfer|pg||
nt|april7: the contract depends on how W plays the @S suit, he can make 3@H,2@D 1@C and perhaps 3 @S, before NS has 5  tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Yalcin Atabey|pg||
nt|athene: if he loses to the @SK the defence will definitely have @SK, two diamonds, and two aces|pg||
nt|april7: K of @D and @H 10, then if he doesn't make the finesse in @S because he wants to play @H from dummy he wil  be rewarded|pg||
nt|athene: but he definitely needs the spades as well as the hearts|pg||
nt|athene: i don't see how he can refuse the spade finesse|pg||
nt|atabey: ty roland :) hi all|pg||
nt|athene: hi|pg||
nt|athene: there's plenty of room for south to have a double without the @SK|pg||
nt|jkotor: co do 4, nie wiem, kibic mi podpowiada na priv, który obserwuje OR|pg||
nt|lechcold: tu nic siê nie wydarzy|pg||
nt|jkotor: cisza przed burz¹?|pg||
nt|tokay1975:  not easy  after a sp lead he has  to duck |pg||
nt|jillan:  a Swdish friend told me that in a match Swedn:Iceland Peter played agains Magnus nd Magus, and after 12 realying rounds the Swedes end up in 7@H. Petre puts the cards straight back into teh fold and says to his Magnus, you should lead a @D. |pg||
nt|toral5: ian time AGAIN to shout FLAT GAME?|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: A direct 3@H would show values, so West travels via a Lebensohl 2NT to show a weak hand with hearts.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muiderberg_convention|pg||
nt|athene: leads a top spade to see which red suit to attack|pg||
nt|daman: 9 toppers   may be room for an overtrick |pg||
nt|capercliff: we all need to remember that the play is very fast at this table, hard for the operator to keep up sometimes|pg||
nt|hedyg: Bas is doing fine :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: bd 8 Swiss played 5@DX= for 12 imps|pg||
nt|iain sime: Should manage six trump, two clubs and a diamond.|pg||
nt|athene: ok - now it's harder :) |pg||
nt|cicus: this won't make declarer sweat|pg||
nt|athene: short of putting the stop card down and bidding 4@S, west can't really superaccept now unless he wants to risk the 5-level, which he really can't|pg||
nt|hedyg: 12 tricks are there|pg||
nt|toral5: dutch playing strong @C here?|pg||
nt|toral5: many tricks here|pg||
nt|yuval10: indeed.....and a 7 easy tricks|pg||
nt|peachy: good stop, helped by their system|pg||
nt|yuval10: Bulgaria will take the lead after this board|pg||
nt|toral5: lol haans|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|viren169: 2@C= opening hand with 6+ clubs or 5+ clubs and a major|pg||
nt|viren169: Not sure there is any style in it!|pg||
nt|toral5: precision 2@C is ok 4 me viren:)|pg||
nt|toral5: lol|pg||
nt|viren169: It is part of their kit-bag, so it must be bid!|pg||
nt|toral5: 3@C wd ve gone only 1 down;courtesy @D qx|pg||
nt|viren169: With or w/out style!|pg||
mb|4S|nt|brolucius: 2@C is game-forcing balanced or diamond support.|pg||
nt|brgpro: they are on they way...with a lot of relays i think...although we dont really know their agreements|pg||
nt|atabey: on board 7 the lead to 6@h was a dia. declarer didnt take the @h finess. however he could pitch the @d's to @c ace and the 4th @s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Madala's 1NT backfired in the other room|pg||
nt|sharkey: in VP no - IMPs yes :)|pg||
nt|bagman: Now N has values to do something|pg||
nt|hedyg: David when your pd shows a strong hand an ace, a king and Qx in pds suit is not a lot?|pg||
nt|bagman: X or 3@S|pg||
nt|bagman: depending on agreements on X|pg||
nt|lesniak: dobrze wykonane|pg||
nt|bagman: S had already shown a fine @D suit. Now it was time to show some support for partner|pg||
nt|idc: When it is a strong 1@c, players like to interfere on anything (and quite right too)|pg||
nt|idc: ok, on you go Sapan...|pg||
nt|toral5: lol:)|pg||
nt|othered1: overcall of forcing @C can be different from overcall of a natural opening, as objectives differ.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: agree, but 1@D isn't much of an interference|pg||
nt|ritong: car, même si upmark a remarquablement jugé son jeu en disant 4@d, son part a pas la main pure|pg||
mb|p|nt|dougdscsu: Bas is god|pg||
nt|hedyg: oh my|pg||
nt|mamos: 3Nt coming|pg||
nt|marlowepi: for most of us, not an appetizing approach to describing the E hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is played from the other side |pg||
nt|andyv:  10 more imps for Bulgaria is Italy stopped at 3@d on board 5|pg||
nt|jillan:  Noone says anyrthing more, and everyone put theis cards in |pg||
mb|5H|nt|brgpro: my guess is: 2@d=extra length or Bal. min. and 2@h asked which, 2@s showed the later|pg||
nt|brolucius: An initial response of 3@C would be 8-11 natural.|pg||
nt|jtr: It needs very specific cards facing a weak NT which i imagine Bocchi has shown by now|pg||
nt|jtr: Madala is maybe just looking for the best game|pg||
nt|brolucius: It would be quite a system triumph to identify that you were CLOSE to a slam. |pg||
nt|brgpro: the perfect card S can find is: xx  KQx xxxxx Akx|pg||
nt|brolucius: xx/Axxx/AKx/Qxxx also good.|pg||
nt|brgpro: that isn't that min....he might rebid 2NT with that|pg||
nt|brgpro: now he is on the corss road...go beyond 3NT or not...|pg||
nt|jtr: I imagine 2@d showed the weak NT with 2NT showing something else  Common methods which i myself use|pg||
nt|brolucius: The convention card says 2NT rebid is 12-14 balanced but may not be bid with x-x in a suit. Here he has a low doubleton spade.|pg||
nt|jtr: I cant see that David|pg||
nt|brgpro: so 2NT asked his weakness and 3@s showed it?|pg||
nt|brolucius: At the end of the notes - last section.|pg||
nt|jtr: ah!|pg||
nt|jtr: Wow you are efficient!|pg||
nt|brolucius: In fact 2NT rebid is 11-14 balanced, with no low doubleton.|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am spurred into action by the presence of top-class commentators alongside.|pg||
nt|hedyg: lucky to find K@H with 3 @ss|pg||
nt|atabey: so it was unbeatable afterall. the lead didnt matter|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Fayad values the hand as stronger than Versace did in othr room .. but they still stop short of game|pg||
nt|capercliff: maybe its Lauria's turn to only claim 10?:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: esp when opps can bid spades, highly likely when u r short there, your main suit can get buried|pg||
nt|mamos: no double because it asked for a spade nd here Spade holder on lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: but he found the lead |pg||
nt|Gerben42: only the best graduate from the Blue Team bridge school|pg||
nt|barnets: well clearly north likes to bid a lot|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Some play XX here instead of 3@H has an invite to 4@H so that 3@H can be used for competition, or just push opps out|pg||
nt|pikolo: jesli trafi uk³ad|pg||
nt|jkotor: no to zysk Szwedów za celny wist w PO|pg||

nt|snetram:  S nie moÅ¼e trzy razy atutowaÄ|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I am not sure why I keep getting asked, but the names are as on the screen. When Balicki came in he told me EW swapped seats|pg||
nt|jkotor: przegra na skrócie?|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: The Bocchi-Madala convention card is available at:  http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/May/OpenTeams/italy/bocchi-madala.pdf|pg||
nt|brgpro: finally he dicided to cross the boarder|pg||
nt|jtr: Ah of course, they cant have 18-19 balanced|pg||
nt|sharkey: The way this match is going may also influence NS bidding here|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't think EW need to speculate|pg||
nt|petergill: Janis Ozols likes to compete, as we saw earlier on a hand that cost 5 imps|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: EW amazed at dummy|pg||
nt|gulyas: this another 2 imps to HUN, regardless of making 5 or 6|pg||
nt|athene: you are kidding! wow|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Not an operator prank :)|pg||
nt|toral5: ahh.at last v got to see a 2 digit score.italy gained 13|pg||
mb|5S|nt|Walddk2: A Gazzilli sequence got them to the 3-level|pg||
nt|Walddk2: was impossible for Madala to stop short after that|pg||
nt|schtsch: woohoo|pg||
nt|schtsch: the lead is set|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: N had no reason to move over 3N|pg||
nt|athene: trusting that @CAK aren't cashing AND a bad heart break isn't causing difficulties|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: Here Sementa is unlikely to drop the @CK|pg||
nt|hedyg: J@H works well here|pg||
nt|skorchev: Bulgaria won 10 imps in board 5, since Madala-Bocchi stopped at 3@D+2 ... (5@D= was played here)|pg||
nt|tokay1975: this is hard play  cause  he has to know 62 spades and dia finesse off|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: They open 2@c with that|pg||
nt|brgpro: i think 4NT shows odd number of key cards....i played a lot of Italian pairs, still dont quite understand their turbo method|pg||
nt|brolucius: If anyone bid and made 6@D against me on these cards, I would think that I was not destined to win the match.|pg||
nt|hedyg: lets try not to exaggerate :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: wudnt bet on it....:)|pg||
nt|bagman: If he ever gets to dummy|pg||
nt|sybarra: I would hard pressed to find a low sp lead from the N holding |pg||
nt|petergill: He is a passed hand, so he knew if partner passed the Dbl that it would be OK|pg||
nt|barnets: not surprised|pg||
nt|snetram:  ale zagrania dwa razy atu- poÅÄczone z impasem - wygrywa|pg||
nt|koksoy: @S R lead  overtaken by  A  and  diamond  ...  now??  decision  time|pg||
nt|bagman: South might guess this; the defense would have played 2 rounds of spades if there was need for @D finesse|pg||
nt|othered1: They do seem to have adopted that philosophy that if you don't overcall at 1-level you don't have any long suit.|pg||
nt|haans: Last match Isreal vs Italy Poland vs Germany|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Typical I guess, you leep making the wrong decisions once you started|pg||
nt|athene: that's giving opps an awful lot of respect|pg||
nt|Walddk2: *keep|pg||
nt|athene: i am not sure i would give anyone THAT much respect :)|pg||
nt|toral5: lol|pg||
nt|haans: england leads 4-1 (boards)|pg||
nt|viren169: Simpsom would have competed to 3@S|pg||
nt|toral5: and 3@S=down|pg||
nt|8252: il lui manque clairement quelque chose à @c, mais upmark s'est réfugié|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|bagman: he might be forced to|pg||
nt|bagman: ok the old trick|pg||
nt|lesniak: nie wszyscy majatak¹ szansê- niektorzy np Francuzi graja ,¿e 2 tref i po 2 karach 2 kier jest inwituj¹ce|pg||

nt|ritong: oui|pg||
nt|8252: ils sont affamés, ces suédois|pg||
pc|d4|nt|bagman: S put lead to dummy to score the @CK|pg||

nt|pikolo: dama trefl w impasie|pg||
nt|lesniak: chyba nie wolno by bylo grac 2 gego atuta|pg||
nt|april7: because of the X W might finesse for the 10 first round or second round|pg||
pc|dA|nt|brgpro: not that bad...only a little less than 50% slam...|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, it's not a bad slam particularly but difficult to bid, as you said earlier.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://psbridge.gotdns.com/bbo/allvug/  - Vugraph Hand Records (PDF)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: lol thanks all (and Doug)|pg||
nt|capercliff: im not really sure what to say about this auction|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: It was actually (again!) someone coming in for the BM|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I should just gag them...|pg||
nt|bagman: Now @H + spade guarantees set if E has Qxx of diamonds|pg||
nt|schtsch: sorry for this cheering, we are watching football and i got carried away|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@D showed 13 cards and that's no lie|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|brolucius: If you don't play a two-suited 2@S, then many would open a normal weak 2@S on that North hand.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Correction, the minor can be four cards only|pg||
nt|brolucius: Anyway, it seems that they had a splendid investigative auction and decided, very reasonably, to stay out of it.|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: In Pairs it might've been easier, raising 5@D to 6@D because it's bad score anyway :)|pg||
nt|daman: he need to play a @S or a @D|pg||
nt|athene: so even if it's against a game in the other room that might be ok|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Played for 11. might have had a dble squeeze for 12.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: we all remember when it doesn't work....|pg||
nt|toral5: haha|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I counted them|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|daman: s|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can be pretty sure the @DA is right|pg||
nt|hedyg: S thought pd had singleton @S not to raise to 3@s|pg||
nt|fokal: mouais|pg||
pc|hA|nt|bagman: Sementa probably reasoned that N must have the @CK to pass|pg||
nt|sharkey: still need to locate a few honors yet so too early to play for drop|pg||
nt|bagman: And so far, he really cannot draw inferences from the nyances in S's defensive play|pg||
nt|lesniak: brawo za wstawienie damy pik!!|pg||

nt|athene: yes but that's irrelevant - leading to the nine is just as bad as leading to the queen|pg||
nt|drorp: italians win 8 when Bocchi chooses not to transfer on board 7|pg||
pc|h2|nt|capercliff: im told to say "certifiable":)|pg||
nt|rodvenn: 5 @c was a much better contract on 7 than 3NT. Deserved to gain|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: There's an orchestra practising just on the other side of a wall here|pg||
nt|babs59: I would have thought West would continue the trump attack|pg||
nt|corplaw: 10 imps for croatia|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The auction indicated that both opponents had a spade control, but did they say anything about clubs?|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|daman: yes|pg||
nt|athene: firstly @SAK @DA is 1@S not 2@S|pg||
nt|toral5: missed the trump promotion here|pg||
nt|8252: 1 @s contré tout a l'heure, là 3 ou 4 tentatives pour le slam|pg||
pc|sA|nt|atabey: kolata did not dbl 2@h. which I believe was a better move. and he earned 5 imps|pg||
nt|athene: secondly with the @DA north would be more likely to just clear the spades|pg||
nt|rodvenn: the 6 points on 5 is also well deserved to Italy, but the 10imps on 1 is slightly lucky|pg||
pc|s7|nt|bagman: Now south wanted the @ST back|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: S powinien pomyleæ ze trzy piki ma Adam|pg||

nt|snetram:  Åwietnie siÄ broni Cezary, ale na maksy S miaÅby problem|pg||
nt|koksoy: nice  defence..|pg||
nt|bagman: West cannot believe that S has Axx of clubs|pg||
pc|s3|nt|bagman: Technically and in isolation, declarer should have lead @HJ to pick up KTx onside. Here, however, the @HJ was needed to guard against diamond overruf|pg||
nt|marlowepi: once W bids the suit you have to lead a low one at IMPs|pg||
nt|wstuart: not until he cashes his @CA  :)|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|schtsch: trump promotion|pg||
nt|schtsch: not needed though|pg||
nt|athene: this will surely be a loss - maybe small loss against 3@S, maybe big loss against 4@S making|pg||
nt|athene: the best they can hope for is a flat board against 4@S-1|pg||
nt|athene: well they bid a slam knowing south had long clubs|pg||
nt|fokal: je suis pas convaincuu par le fait de ne pas montrer les @c avec le jeu d'ouest|pg||
pc|s2|nt|hedyg: and a @c back|pg||
nt|brolucius: After a club lead (against that 5@D doubled), declarer simply drew trumps and set up a club winner in the South hand to pitch the spade loser from dummy.|pg||
nt|paulg:  not an easy situation to read|pg||
nt|tokay1975: only way to make  is to duck spade win next or third  and play jack of hearts but this is open cards play|pg||
nt|besbes: la pologne a 3 pts|pg||
pc|h3|nt|athene: ok, he isn't risking the contract for an overtrick|pg||
nt|athene: fair enough|pg||
nt|hedyg: why not K@H before @s finesse?|pg||
nt|gulyas: just plain Dumbovich, getting everything right|pg||
nt|ziff:  More or less the same defence at both tables|pg||
nt|8252: ça dépend s'il est mini ou maxi de son 2 SA : il avait peut etre pas trop de réserve|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|Vugraphznk: Declarer took a finesse from dummy, but I have no clue how...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: too unlikely that partner has 2 tricks of his own|pg||
nt|barnets: in the open north was content with just 1 X|pg||
nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@h on a @s lead would have been (only just) -1, but the 4@S overcall at this vulnerability is normal|pg||
nt|toral5: ll cross ruff the rest|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|hedyg: he could have played the 9|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Table complimenting Price on his lead|pg||

nt|jtr: As i said, in keeping with transfer responses|pg||
nt|athene: this was west's 4@S, i presume|pg||
nt|bjacobs: As a passed hand, I think you are worth 2@S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@D also possible, but the spades look good|pg||
nt|mbruun: You just turned 20 last week. Youre getting more sensible on your older days|pg||
nt|mdgraham: after all, they are solid|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Partner usually has 4 spades when he doubles 1@H, but not always as we see|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In an ideal world he has|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Still, this 4-3 fit is fairly harmless.  And if partner has extras, he will bid, and I can show my heart stopper next|pg||
nt|bjacobs: North thinking here is an overbid|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it's not an ideal world, even though it's the only one we've got|pg||
nt|mbruun: I dont think you should interfer over 1 H with the North hand after partner passed. Game is highly unlikely, and partner can still bidd with good distibution|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Wow|pg||
nt|sybarra: I would 1 @S  but my better suit is @D's here |pg||
nt|mbruun: I just turned 21 yesterday|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Looks like it|pg||

nt|drorp: so it can go 3@D-P-P-X|pg||
nt|drorp: to find it|pg||
nt|atabey: 2@s probably some sort of unballenced inverted|pg||
nt|jillan:  so 11 more for Italy when 4@D went one down|pg||
nt|toral5: 2nt=minors.but opening hand?|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: I know play X=M, 1NT=m, 1x is t/o of that suit|pg||
nt|othered1: I think it is not allowed in ACBL.  Proscription of bids meant solely to obstruct, particularly on random hands.|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Fairly simple :)|pg||
nt|toral5: why is 3@C alerted?|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Minimum|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@D asking for shortage I believe, not sure|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: With NS overcalling style, the S hand would be considered a maximum, right?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well not a minimum for sure|pg||
nt|bagman: S hoping that the @HK is with length|pg||
nt|hedyg: their CC says they play Ghestem|pg||

nt|daman: serbia gained 12 on Board 9    Italy never got to game in the OR|pg||
nt|daman: he can make this.......double dummy|pg||
nt|athene: the multi-2@D has definitely been outscoring the natural 2@S opener this match|pg||
nt|daman: yes|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Serbia leading Italy by 24 with 9 compared boards, who would've though|pg||
nt|athene: despite common claims that it can't be better to allow opps so much more room|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that never stopped the Italians, and it doesn't seem to do them any harm |pg||
nt|rodvenn: also the board 8 shows better judgement and system by the Italians. |pg||
nt|sharkey: Slovakia off the Schneider??|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, 1NT looks OK.|pg||
nt|sharkey: 1 NT by N may be an alternative as well|pg||
nt|bagman: North hasn't made this, yet|pg||
nt|marlowepi: spade natural lead|pg||
nt|brolucius: 5@D was the obvious move if South does decide to advance.|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Wouldn't this be a 2@D overcall then?|pg||
nt|iain sime: My experience is the same as David's.|pg||
nt|hedyg: no Bas|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now he only needs to maake it|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I thought 3@C two highest remaining, cuebid two most extreme and 2NT the two lowest|pg||
nt|athene: 3@C from sementa showing less than 8 hcp|pg||
nt|gulyas: same spot, and a likely push|pg||
nt|athene: both sides played it from the singleton hand|pg||
nt|athene: as no-one ever bids clubs to mean clubs these days|pg||
nt|toral5: very lucky 6@D coming up.but they wont bid for sure|pg||
nt|toral5: 4@C has to b BOLD.pd can easily be @C less|pg||
nt|othered1: Yes, why would it be alerted?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: at least they had spades! :)|pg||
mb|5D|nt|marlowepi: sometimes you catch Txxxxx with partner and 22. or you may find Axxxx|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@d would be majors|pg||

nt|gulyas: OR cos of prec 1@C, and Gazilli here|pg||

nt|athene: think|pg||
nt|andyv:  a claimer for 5... I wonder what the alert was for.  Maybe NS play NAMYATS|pg||
nt|ziff:  Versace probably is a bit nervous about @D Kx, but he can t right-side the contract anyway, and his partner has the right cards for him|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West will be pleased to see a non-@DQ opening lead|pg||
nt|petergill: On Bd 6, 6@S would be a wonderful contract to reach. Nobody has bid 6@S so far. Here is Group B's scores on Bd 6 http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/runningsc...|pg||

nt|athene: south didn't want to bid just 2@H with A A @HQ|pg||
nt|athene: but this is a bit high|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: hard to only make 4 here|pg||
nt|drorp: and on this case it will reward as both 3@S and 3@D make|pg||
nt|atabey: well done by ballancing. 3@s is a good spot for NS|pg||
nt|drorp: who's thinking? and why?|pg||
nt|atabey: maybe it was not a good decision for versace to open in 3rd seat. it might go passed out|pg||

mb|p|nt|brolucius: The kibitzer who told me those scores must be psychic then.|pg||
nt|bagman: There are something like 6 to 7 losers|pg||
nt|sharkey: by no means no - the way the match has developed so far....|pg||
nt|bagman: Slovakia might get 5 IMPs but this can be also flat|pg||
nt|brolucius: Of course it would be foolish of East to double just because he has loads of points - an insult to the opponents (even if they were not Italian).|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He can, double dummy, but that is not the same as he will|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@d majors, 2NT @H+@C, 3@C @S+@C|pg||
nt|stc: @s is probably best play|pg||
nt|Walddk2: East is squeezed to pieces without the count|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Maybe we play different Ghestems :) So many modifications around these days|pg||
nt|brolucius: Many actual partnerships play different Ghestems, as Iain pointed out.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: See what happens to East if Bocchi cashes lots of trumps|pg||
nt|hedyg: he can drop the @ds?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But then Bocchi can set up spades in comfort|pg||
nt|stc: The last 6 cards are 3@c, 2@s and 1@d|pg||
nt|hedyg: so i think Mossop could have a played a higher card than the 6|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If East has no more diamonds|pg||
nt|hedyg: though*|pg||
nt|hedyg: any reason not to?|pg||
nt|athene: well you might sometimes run into a defensive crossruff where just drawing trumps worked better, but it's pretty unlikely|pg||

nt|rnmalik: Stiff @S a big bother for N.|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: People who normally play the so-called convention "2-way checkback" utilise the 2NT response to the 1NT rebid as a puppet to 3@C, to show a shortage|pg||

mb|p|nt|bagman: disapointment, when dummy shows (and doubly so with the @CJ there)|pg||
nt|athene: certainly if you are going to go all the way to the 3-level you might as well play in game|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: Yes|pg||
nt|corplaw: 5N pick a slam, but S not sure what slam to pick|pg||

nt|ahri: even 6@h could make :)|pg||
nt|schtsch: madala would like to pick 6@c but suit is not a great one|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I think South believes that given he's shown 45 already, how come partner didn't set clubs with 3@C's|pg||
nt|schtsch: enough, though|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: If South has 2434 it is also likely that he would bid 3NT over 2NT|pg||
nt|schtsch: correct, so he is marked with 2425|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Since 2NT over 2@H would most likely deny 4 clubs|pg||

nt|iain sime: This doesn't work if a diamond is played. The squeeze would have worked- East had to keep all his black cards so declarer could have given up a spade.|pg||

nt|iain sime: Win the lead and play all the trumps would have worked.|pg||
nt|stc: if he ducks the @d E must play @s to beat|pg||
nt|brolucius: East had no idea at all how the diamond suit lay.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It won't help East to come down to 2 spades, 1 diamond and 3 clubs. Then declarer can ruff out the clubs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: There was a legitimate line |pg||
nt|Walddk2: But a little easier for us|pg||
nt|petergill: South had 2 losing choices, give partner a ruff and miss out on @D tricks, or takes winners. He chose the latter|pg||
nt|petergill: Half time, and Latvia are holding the mighty Italy well |pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: In Namyats, wouldn't this be a 4@D opening?|pg||
nt|andyv:  it would except that the hand was pretty weak in hcp|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I'd probably open 1@S and rebid 4@S, showing a really good suit with too much on the side to open 4@S|pg||

mb|p|nt|jtr: So you werent tempted to venture some of your 'hard' earned dosh?:)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3nt overcall?|pg||
nt|jbgood: multi, 2@s would have shown 8-11 hcp and 6 cards|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4S easier to make than to bid|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 4@S is one too high, though|pg||
nt|andyv:  a very strong NT|pg||
nt|paulg:  Denning with a Meckwell-style 1@d opener, is there a worse 11 points?|pg||
nt|andyv:  but you are right...4@s would show about 7 tricks and 4@d (namyats) would show about 7.5 to 8 tricks|pg||
nt|babs59: some believe Namyats should have more control of outside suits than that hand - eg singleton in one of the 'less stopped' suits|pg||
nt|athene: 2@C overcall over 1@D causes a lot of problems |pg||
nt|athene: very easy to miss major-suit fits or find bad ones|pg||

nt|daman: if they can get there|pg||
nt|rodvenn: or on board 8 a misundeerstanding: the double of the 2@S splinter bid howed spades. But Svendsen seem tu have thought it was an OD, showing hearts|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Hoftaniska asked me to call the TD|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Not sure what it was all about|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: He seemed to want Bocchi to tell the TD what he told him. The TD just told Hofta to stop...|pg||
nt|bagman: I've been wrong before, though, in my estimates|pg||
nt|antoniz: jak wysoko dojad¹?|pg||
nt|barnets: In his earlier days young Madala would have opened 4@S as would many- now he opened 1@S and got a plus|pg||
nt|athene: interesting choice of overcall - 1nt was definitely an option there|pg||
nt|gulyas: or dbl|pg||
nt|cicus: E had many choices here, including X and 1NT|pg||
nt|schtsch: 2@c something|pg||
nt|athene: here for example north has to double, because he isn't strong enough for 2@S|pg||
nt|athene: weak notrump from north will buy it, i guess|pg||
nt|rhelle: 3rd in hand, you can vary the strength of your weak 2 openings|pg||
nt|haans: any|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: i dont like the 2@H bid :(|pg||
nt|hedyg: what is wrong with 2NT?|pg||
nt|brolucius: If Hedy and I would both rebid 2NT it must be right.|pg||
nt|bagman: It all depends on their methods. Playing standardish 2@H is wrong but here we do not know.|pg||
nt|hedyg: :) ty David|pg||
nt|sharkey: I think we all wud join in|pg||
nt|Gerben42: I guess if the Blue Team school told him not to, perhaps we all should listen ?|pg||
nt|bagman: Yes, if no aces :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Italya are more likely to win this than England are to beat Slovenia in the World Cup and England are '2-to-1 on'.|pg||
nt|othered1: here 6@D is OK with @C lead and excellent without it.|pg||
nt|atabey: never reachable 6@d|pg||
nt|hedyg: slam in @d is on IF he finds Q@s|pg||
nt|bagman: This looks like a quiet push in 1NT|pg||
nt|snetram:  bardzo obrotowe rozdanie|pg||
nt|bagman: Without any other knowledge running the @H9 is correct as A/Q offside are equal but 9 takes care of the AQx|pg||

pc|d8|nt|othered1: is north worth 3@D in their methods?  That could get south interested?|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@c is transfer|pg||

nt|andyv:  Hi Pekka:)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I never said that - it was Mathias :)|pg||
nt|rodvenn: so there may have been a wrong explanation to Svendsen ... |pg||
nt|fabsayc: this auction strange, did west really pass 2@H|pg||
nt|fabsayc: diamond suit blocked|pg||
nt|ahri: i am not sure if 6@s was played in best manner, if east held KQx clubs and 4 hearts with jack, bocchi killed his squeeze by playing 3 rounds of hearts first|pg||
nt|athene: if you decided that north had four hearts for his double, and you had to play the heart suit for no losers, you would have to play for the drop |pg||
nt|athene: you can't pick up @HQxxx with north, only @HQx with south|pg||
nt|toral5: 2@S=muiderberg?|pg||

pc|d2|nt|brolucius: Like a moment for a horror film. Strangely, the bookies have maintained exactly the same odds for England still to win the World Cup. 8/1 fourth favourites.|pg||

nt|paulg:  you can often tell a pair's opening style by looking at responder's hand after a 1NT overcall|pg||
nt|koksoy: :)|pg||
nt|paulg:  if you were a very sound pair, then you might double with 8 points (or at least consider it)|pg||
nt|rhelle: I would expect so, yes - 2@s shows 5@s and 4+ in a minor|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Lavazza...|pg||
nt|yuval10: normal sequence|pg||

nt|ahri: i might be overseeing something though|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 1 club honour onside = 75% though, with the added chance of hearts 3-3 or 4-2 with @HJx|pg||

nt|mbruun: First quarter 46-0 for Italy, second quarter 8-0 for Lithuania, now its time for the third|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That's a good stop ... it's a tempting hand, but the lack of aces is crucial|pg||
nt|hedyg: and the lead is....directed!|pg||
nt|brolucius: In the old days 1@D - 3@S would show the North hand. Now it is usually used as a splinter bid agreeing diamonds.|pg||
nt|hedyg: disc @c on @d and claim when that works for 11 tricks|pg||
nt|bagman: NS' system card states: NAT: maybe reverse bids|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am told that in Poland a 2NT rebid denies four hearts.|pg||

nt|bagman: Sout has values to compete|pg||
nt|athene: i guess his reasoning was, partner can still bid 3@S over 3@H if he has four|pg||
nt|cicus: probably|pg||
nt|athene: with 5 spades and 4 hearts you would be more inclined to double 3@D, i think|pg||

nt|hedyg: they cannot afford to throw tricks away like this|pg||
nt|brolucius: I don't really see the value in such a method because North can introduce hearts over a 2NT rebid. Meanwhile, South has given an excellent description of his hand.|pg||
nt|sharkey: the @H reverse distorts the S hand as well|pg||
nt|hedyg: definitely|pg||
nt|sharkey: unless that's their agreement|pg||
nt|bagman: There are multiple structures a bidding system can be built on. I don't think that we have the competence to analyze them all|pg||

nt|hedyg: if it looks like an opening it is an opening is ok for me. this doesnt look like 1|pg||
nt|iain sime: I don't like it, especially if playing 15/17 as it puts to big a range on the 1NT rebid. But these are openers nowadays, and I have to confess that I would not have passed.|pg||
nt|petergill: At the other table, West played @DK, @DQ then @D to ace, and East played a 4th @D , hoping partner had a spade greaer than the 8|pg||
nt|paulg:  or club and diamond so he does have the problem again|pg||
pc|d4|nt|hedyg: 8@s was an entry to dummy to disc all his losers :(|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: gdyby chodzi³o tylko o nieoddanie wiecej niz jednej ;ewy w pikach przy braku komunikacji by³oby to zagranie poprawne|pg||
pc|c5|nt|pasker: he may also now its from AK bare as potentially no support dble|pg||
nt|petergill: Correct, as at this table, is the low @D at Trick 2|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Gotthard went to the bathroom|pg||
nt|athene: even if Lauria counts the hcp and decides south has the @HQ, he might play to drop it - can't afford to lead the @HJ if it's doubleton|pg||
nt|athene: missing the six and the eight|pg||
nt|athene: and nine|pg||
nt|athene: everyone keeps saying it's easy to guess the @HQ|pg||
nt|athene: it isn't|pg||
nt|athene: you have to guess the shape as well|pg||
nt|april7: only an inspired J of @H will do the job|pg||
nt|atabey: the J of @s is not a good signal. shows the @s position to declarer|pg||
nt|athene: he might try the @H10, hoping south is asleep and doesn't cover with @HQx|pg||
nt|drorp: the spade play of small 1st makes it harder for Lauria to read the shape|pg||
nt|drorp: south could have Qxx aswell, not hard to unblock after partner plays A and J with obvious length|pg||
nt|athene: the main point is not the six-card diamond suit so much as the double of 2@C from north|pg||
nt|athene: we know he hasn't got many points for it so we might be more inclined to play him for the right shape|pg||
nt|athene: i.e. length in both majors|pg||
nt|april7: and since the 4th Q cannot be finessed E might finess S for that card|pg||
nt|atabey: he wont play for the drop thats for sure|pg||
nt|toral5: sd escape 4 100 if he inserts @D 10|pg||
nt|toral5: buth @H ace instead of a @C wd ve secured 300|pg||
nt|yuval10: Q@d will be enough|pg||
nt|toral5: infact  q is corrct.cos he can pitch dummys @D on @S|pg||
nt|yuval10: then @s finesse|pg||

nt|fabsayc: of both aces offside|pg||
nt|toral5: NOT a gr8 play again.|pg||
pc|s7|nt|brolucius: East has to calculate whether it is worth rising with the @HQ to get West to draw dummy's last trump.|pg||
nt|atabey: usually zorlu has very good instincts|pg||
nt|hedyg: OR stopped in 5@d|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: So he'll cash @SAK Yalcin? :)|pg||
nt|atabey: but this very hard |pg||
nt|paulg:  Piper is easily the best declarer in the Scotland team ... practice makes perfect|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Haha|pg||
nt|capercliff: im not sure he can get this right, is there a case to playing the double @d finesse instead of low to the J?|pg||
nt|hedyg: was there a case to play @c?|pg||
nt|hedyg: i thought that was risky|pg||
nt|hedyg: he needs the @ds for his contract|pg||
nt|capercliff: i dont think the defence can stop 9 tricks as it happens|pg||
nt|rodvenn: Hofta realised he could not beat the contract|pg||
nt|snetram:  ma jeszcze czas przez dwie lewy|pg||
pc|s3|nt|brolucius: I checked the instructions on my various packets of heart pills and they made no mention of taking an extra dose before England world cup matches.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if N has stiff heart ace, that line would make|pg||
nt|bagman: Now declarer has no time to get that long heart|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|fabsayc: or|pg||
nt|jillan:  board 9 will give 10 to Sweden|pg||
pc|c2|nt|bagman: This is still likely to make: often defense might set up 6th trick in trumps but here declarer has the spots |pg||
nt|brolucius: As often happens, the Italians used 10 bids where the Slovakians thought that 4 were enough. Once in a while, the longer auction would diagnose a good slam, so the extra work can ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: pay off.|pg||
nt|hedyg: so he could have played J@d, then a @s to the 8|pg||
nt|stc: What is the %play in trump here ? I think small to the 9 sligthly better|pg||
nt|brolucius: Iain makes a good point about 11-14 being too large a range to cover accurately.|pg||
nt|Gerben42: at least 3@S wouldnt have been let through here either :)|pg||
nt|babs59: interesting - with no @D at trick 2, North would play the @C the other way, for safety|pg||
pc|d6|nt|bjacobs: The winning contract was probably 1NT.  It could be reached if, for example, West opens 1NT|pg||
nt|bagman: anyhow a flat 450, wasn't it|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I was told 11, but corrected to 10 now|pg||
nt|bagman: ok|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok ty Bas|pg||
nt|paulg:  excellent defence that will set up the spade trick as the seventh defensive trick|pg||
pc|cT|nt|Vugraphznk: Lauria is pretty disgruntled. Has been like that since the 3NTX|pg||
nt|peachy: an overtrick IMP for Bulgaria here|pg||

pc|c7|nt|hedyg: see? instincts!|pg||

nt|andyv:  only 50 a trick|pg||
nt|mamos: did colin really double?|pg||
nt|bagman: N really should have gone and played the spade|pg||
nt|bagman: Unless he could count for surely that S has KJx|pg||
pc|hA|nt|hedyg: was there a case for playing Q@S?|pg||
nt|mamos: any one see why?|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: As just did the other players|pg||
nt|gulyas: Italy down in a slam in the OR|pg||
nt|gulyas: chance for a swing again|pg||
nt|athene: not a great 6@H as you have a diamond to get rid of as well as the trump suit to negotiate, but not that bad|pg||
nt|athene: double dummy it makes of course - as does 7@S|pg||
nt|cicus: how would you play it on  a@D lead?|pg||
nt|hedyg: as does 6NT then|pg||
nt|hedyg: i think not even Roland would bid it|pg||

nt|gulyas: this surely is a Roland slam|pg||
nt|hedyg: no, Roland slams are 12.89%|pg||
nt|gulyas: oh, sry:)|pg||
nt|athene: the big question is whether you play a trump to the ten - gains against small singleton with north, of course, but loses on lots of other layouts|pg||

nt|marlowepi: well it wasnt a terribly confident auction, but still...opps are NV which means smaller penalty and also less likelihood EW have done something very overambitious|pg||
nt|brolucius: As I have mentioned before. Marc Smith tells me that in his system there is no way to avoid 3NT with 11 opposite 11. The responding hand raises the 2NT rebid to 3NT, in case opener ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: has 14. But he claims that such 22-point 3NT contracts are usually made. Not when I try it! |pg||
nt|hedyg: V/L play 1@s as 10-21 and Versace did NOT open!|pg||
nt|cicus: spades must come in anyway if you lose a trump so best seems a small trump to the 10|pg||
nt|athene: on a diamond lead you don't want to risk them knocking out the dummy entry which you might need for the spades|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes... we were trying to remember when last time Italy lost back to back matches|pg||
nt|petergill: 6@C, 6@S and 6NT are all playable, but how can North know that South has @C9, or South know that North has @C10? Too tough.|pg||
nt|athene: 5@C sac not so bad here|pg||
nt|atabey: the way to 4@h was also ugly :)|pg||
nt|drorp: 4@S from S seems normal, he has a 6 card fit but his hand is balanced so it's not like he's under bidding or anything like that, W will probably sacrifice over that|pg||

nt|andy_h: 2@D is "trash multi", which is like a weak 2 except the strength is 2-7 and can be a 5 card suit|pg||
nt|xenya: deaja vu of sorts -- if NS bid 6@H or 6N, they will make it|pg||
nt|jbgood: Brogeland is in 6 hearts in the OR|pg||
nt|andy_h: This will allow 2M openings to be 8-11 which can be destructive and constructive in nature.  If you have ever come across those 6M with 10hcp that doesn't deem worthy of a 1M or a ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: 2M opening, then having the 2M=8-11 really helps|pg||
nt|rodvenn: qj of spades maybe a worry for Bocchi|pg||

nt|athene: well, you might just bash out @HAK and then hope to ruff spades down with the diamond as entry|pg||
nt|athene: it perhaps depends whether you get a club or diamond lead|pg||
nt|hedyg: in the mean time Hungary is in 12th position|pg||
nt|gulyas: thats what I thought|pg||
nt|cicus: but the entry is important only if spades are 3-3 with Q offside|pg||
nt|andyv:  this one still has a lot of boards|pg||

nt|bagman: N has good enough hand to bid 4NT or more for take out and then correct @C to diamonds|pg||
nt|paulg:  according to the CC, double is takeout emphasising the majors|pg||
nt|babs59: today has been our coldest (possibly South Australia's wettest) day of the year|pg||

nt|athene: versace going to follow up with 4nt over 4@S perhaps? i think with that suit disparity you want to insist on clubs|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: 3@S could be called enterprising, even NV vs V|pg||
nt|bagman: West has no defense and no distributional surprises|pg||
nt|andyv:  well within the Versace playbook:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: lol|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe it meant colors |pg||
nt|marlowepi: perhaps W pulled wrong card, meaning to bid 1H|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I'd love to play with Marc Smith in that case lol|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 6@H seems reasonable|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 3NT solid @D with too much on the side?|pg||
nt|petergill: 3NT = solid @D's and close to 15 points|pg||
nt|athene: yes, that's quite a small factor|pg||
nt|koksoy: as  both  red  suits divided 4-0  I think  he  can  not  make  slem|pg||
nt|bagman: With both reds breaking as they are, 5@H is the limit|pg||
nt|koksoy: 3 @H   --  5nt  ??|pg||
nt|bagman: They surely bid slam, though|pg||
nt|paulg:  may gain 3 imps even if you go down in 6@h|pg||
nt|paulg:  there will be a few 7@h on the scoresheet|pg||
nt|koksoy: may  be..|pg||
nt|bagman: Declare might make 6@H X against careless defense|pg||
nt|paulg:  Denning may splinter in clubs here|pg||
nt|bagman: N wins the black lead and plays @HJ not covered|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 6H is good defence against 6C|pg||
nt|koksoy: 5 nt  is an old  conventition called  Josephine which asks partner about trump  quality  for  garandslem|pg||
nt|bagman: True, but EW have to find that suit first|pg||
nt|petergill: NS's 1NT is 14-16, so the 1NT rebid was 11-13 (or a very good 10)|pg||
nt|ziff:  Probably|pg||
nt|rnmalik: wow a grand.|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Tarzan Precision at work|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: seniorsi na 4, Bialoglowy na 6 miejscu|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It is a delicate 3NT, although no amount of delicacy would help if a diamond is led|pg||
nt|Walddk2: East can't find that|pg||
nt|bjacobs: East is not yet on lead|pg||
nt|bjacobs: However, I don't think West would lead one either|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No, but he might be after double|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Evil position for Madala|pg||
nt|jillan:  not an easy decision for S here|pg||
nt|bjacobs: A double is somewhat of a blame-transfer bid|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Does that you mean that you think Swedes are evil when they have put him in that position?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: lol|pg||
nt|jillan:  and rightly so!  :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This is why the 2@C bid is mandatory|pg||
nt|jillan:  evil is good....|pg||
nt|jillan:  When I'm good, I'm very good. When I'm bad, I'm better (Mae West)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Must have been a bridge player with that surname|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Can they even beat 3@S?|pg||
nt|jillan:  shoudl be a BUT when I am bad.... there|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I have a "no" and a "yes" so far (to beating 3@S)|pg||
nt|haans: :( :)|pg||
nt|fokal: sa retraite|pg||
nt|fokal: pardon|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Again 2NT to show a weak hand. Partner is expected to rebid 3@C on most shapes. A direct 3@C would have been stronger.|pg||
nt|andyv:  that's why 4 person teams rarely win... just too much bridge over a short period of time.|pg||
nt|jkotor: chyba Adam móg³ o¿ywiæ 2@h "z bilansu sto³u"|pg||

nt|viren169: No but not unreasonable to play for Kx onside |pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: Against good opponents 3@S might help them more than hurt them|pg||

nt|ryskiel_: jak prosisz Irlandczyków Antoni to po angielsku|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: I can see a TD call coming here|pg||
nt|Gerben42: define "too much" pd hasnt promised much|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Too much for a gambling 3NT|pg||
nt|Gerben42: gives Romanovski a tough decision|pg||
nt|petergill: Janis Romanovski realised that his void in partner's suit was terrible for higher contracts - well done|pg||
nt|athene: it's a good advertisement for a) not leading a singleton trump and b) not leading a trump against a small slam|pg||
nt|gulyas: they do have all the controls in the pack|pg||
nt|athene: but i doubt north is going to lead a heart :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: all like 3@H?|pg||
nt|hedyg: i prefer 3NT|pg||
nt|gulyas: its a nice suit|pg||
nt|cicus: I do|pg||
nt|hedyg: is it?|pg||
nt|gulyas: but I can see 3NT as well|pg||
nt|hedyg: the problem is that pd does not have AK@C!|pg||
nt|athene: whether 3@H is a nice suit will depend on how declarer plays it :)|pg||
nt|gulyas: all the controls show towards a suit contract|pg||
nt|hedyg: so you show that|pg||
nt|hedyg: he is imposing @hs and the suit just isnt good enough for that|pg||
nt|cicus: E has a problem here, he would like to invite to 6@H|pg||
nt|schtsch: spade?|pg||
nt|schtsch: what happened to fourth best nowadays?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Interesting that Bocchi didn't overcall 1@H as 1@D promises 0@D|pg||

nt|toral5: this is a telephone number|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: Well, maybe West is prepared to play 4@h facing @hs?|pg||
nt|andyv:  and here it did help them in the OR to get to a thin game|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Landy over opponent's 1NT overcall :)|pg||
nt|mbruun: Trump lead is best for the defense. |pg||
nt|barnets: 6@H would have been better to spectate|pg||
nt|petergill: Entries are a bit awkward|pg||
nt|petergill: in 3NT|pg||
nt|Gerben42: too few high cards missing to really be in trouble though|pg||
nt|barnets: no he has 3@S 4@H a club and a few diamonds|pg||
nt|gulyas: with 12hcp, E may bid more than just 4@H|pg||

nt|hedyg: 4@s rkc in @H?|pg||
nt|cicus: the dreaded 4@S ace ask|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 4@S must be KC asking|pg||
nt|gulyas: yes|pg||

pc|s6|nt|daman: this looks like -1 to me|pg||
nt|daman: 3@Ds   2@Ss and a @H|pg||
nt|athene: slightly unusual that lauria-versace passed 2@D out|pg||
nt|athene: many pairs would be in a forcing situation after doubling a 1nt overcall|pg||
nt|daman: what do you think of a double of 2@D by South?|pg||
nt|athene: it's not the same as doubling a 1nt opener (even assuming you play that as strong) because here you know your side has the balance of the points|pg||
nt|athene: i assume NS play double as takeout and north didn't fancy it with such a threadbare hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 7/12 atm Paul|pg||
nt|hedyg: my version looked politer :)|pg||
nt|petergill: The play will be interesting, I think|pg||
nt|schtsch: of course, 1nt asks for passive lead|pg||
nt|rnmalik: We know how the cards are placed but who would risk. |pg||
nt|lechcold: mo¿e, ale popatrz jakie mia³ "wartoci" w m³odszych|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well Madala will have little difficult I feel|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The @HA will beat thin air, and the diamonds won't be runnable|pg||
pc|s5|nt|Walddk4: Top spot when you have a heart loser|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Losing one trick in each suit|pg||
nt|brolucius: This would normally rate as an OK game, but East's 1NT overcall means that there will be a trump loser.|pg||
nt|iceblue: 2NT is LEB, xfers to 3@C|pg||
nt|brolucius: The re-opening double gives North at least three options (clubs, NT or penalty pass).|pg||
nt|brgpro: on @s lead, N has to go up the 10 to make this|pg||
nt|jtr: I hate giving my partner options:)|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is what lazy bidding-panel members describe as a 'flexible action'. (All readers groan immediately).|pg||
nt|bagman: After 3@S it's not possible for NS to stay in 3@C and they might have to bid game as N has enough to act|pg||
nt|bagman: If North is going to lead a heart against 3NT, he should lead a low|pg||
nt|brolucius: If they use ten bids this time too, they will surely get too high.|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Okay, maybe not 2-way... lol|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He suggested that he and I have a game soon. Maybe I should accept|pg||
nt|bagman: and they have actually the highest making contract|pg||
nt|koksoy: Nederlands-Slovakya  2-0|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: The last week has been really pleasurable here, but for two days (one of which is today) where it was overcast|pg||
nt|rv: 2@d seems to be artificial GF here|pg||
nt|cumino: 6NT here. There is squeeze in M but double squeeze position had worked if south had 3@H|pg||
nt|drorp: chose the wrong time to suddenly being conservative, this time a save would work quite well (only 2 off by double finnesing the diamond)|pg||
nt|athene: maybe versace hoping his partner has a strong hand with a spade trick|pg||
nt|toral5: so lot of hard work in last 7 brds|pg||
nt|toral5: 1nt is BETA here?|pg||
nt|peachy: Well, opener did expect the world afterall, competitive decisions are seldom easy|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|pasker: Lauria is probably giving a choice between 3NT and 4@S|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 1@D did show @H apparently|pg||
nt|brolucius: If any kibitzers are thinking of logging off, to enjoy the sunshine, I am told that they will miss one of the most spectacular distributional hands of all time, later in this set.|pg||
nt|paulg:  3@d was no doubt intended as a good raise, but the diamond raise makes it sound less like one|pg||
nt|ziff:  Hand doesn t lie very well for declarer. Control may become a problem|pg||
pc|sK|nt|Walddk4: Top spot for N-S that is, 4@C for E-W|pg||
nt|othered1: Or maybe not. Concention card says what Hedy describes in 1N box, but 1@C box says it shows outside of NT range (11-13).  So which is it?|pg||
nt|bagman: A low heart can give declarer a problem|pg||
nt|gulyas: 0-3|pg||
nt|gulyas: @HQ?|pg||
nt|hedyg: now asking about Q@H|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i am not quite sure what 3@H showed, anybody know?|pg||
nt|toral5: control asking i mean?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I guess de Wijs is de master, but then what's 3@S instead of 3@H|pg||
nt|toral5: so 1@S showed some number of @H?|pg||
nt|jillan:  he has 4@C tricks 2@S tricks and will get 3@H tricks|pg||
pc|s8|nt|antoniz: nie jestem trójjêzyczny jak Ty-angielski , niemiecki i wspania³y polski:):)|pg||
nt|andyv:  @c lead when pd didn't dbl 2@c makes little sense since it's from shortness|pg||
nt|rv: 4n is quantitative from West w/o any agreed fit, possibly showing 18-19, East correctly declined with only 13 hcp and would have accepted with 14/15|pg||
nt|rv: East also knows West is short in @d with 4-4-1-4 and slam doesn't rate to play well with no source of tricks|pg||
nt|viren169: 800|pg||
nt|viren169: 0800 number|pg||
nt|toral5: so contract is 2nt dbl aftr trick 4:)|pg||
pc|s7|nt|jtr: @d lead also gives the vital entry|pg||
nt|brgpro: and he will play @cA and @c i think|pg||
nt|brolucius: In case East or West has @CK-x-x.|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3NT+2 at the other table, I am told.|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: Are you slandering my intel?! :P|pg||
nt|daman: not so sure that was best|pg||
nt|antoniz: piêkne odejcie|pg||
nt|mamos: dont understand much about this hand|pg||
nt|brolucius: It will be nice to say: 'Well, yes, we did lose to Germany in the World Cup, but - against that - I enjoyed that big hand on BBO this morning.'|pg||
nt|Walddk2: England supporters are kindly requested not to have a look at the scoreline in the match against the Netherlands|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Half full glasses are better than the half empty ones|pg||
nt|stc: The problem here is if @c are 4-4 or not|pg||
nt|brolucius: Full glasses even better.|pg||
nt|cicus: 4@S gains in 1 out of 1000 and causes trouble on every 2nd hand|pg||
nt|gulyas: what do you mean?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: This makes sense because else 4@S by responder would be a @S cue and the strong hand would ask Aces, which doesn't make sense|pg||
nt|paulg:  I hate auctions where there is some doubt over the trump suit .. surely Denning would cue bid 5@c if he was certain about hearts?|pg||
nt|koksoy: what  is  1@C  double ??  can  it  be  majors ??|pg||
nt|lechcold: najgorsze z mo¿liwych chyba|pg||
nt|athene: 3@C natural and constructive, but Duboin isn't interested - a little cautious with a decent 8-count, perhaps|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|bagman: with the relays going on N had no information where EW were going. So the X was ok|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://tinyurl.com/ebc-open-b   http://tinyurl.com/ebc-open-a   http://tinyurl.com/3yl8spu  for running Euro scores |pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer has entry problems|pg||
nt|skorchev: after the group stage they'll play less rounds per they (most often 2 rounds), so it isn't impossible to play 4-handed|pg||
nt|andyv:  I always admire auctions like this one where EW were not satisfied in just bidding 4@s but exhausted all possibilities for a slam.|pg||
nt|tokay1975: lorenzo  donot like 3cl but still  he will try with a monster|pg||
nt|toral5: 3@C seemd to be discouraging for lauria|pg||
nt|toral5: 3@C=NO 4@S with @C cards?|pg||
nt|rhelle: the explanation is that 3@c denies 4@s. That explains 3@d as a further try|pg||
nt|tokay1975: yes club values and deniþes 4sp|pg||
pc|s9|nt|brolucius: I am told: 2@h=4@h or max w/o 4M  2@s = relay 3@c = 4@h/4m min. 3@d = asks minor 3@h = 4@c|pg||
nt|cicus: I hate 4@S ace ask for @Hs|pg||
nt|hedyg: pulling the brakes|pg||
nt|gulyas: I love it|pg||
nt|hedyg: why Gabor?|pg||
nt|hedyg: i love it too|pg||
nt|cicus: see above|pg||
nt|athene: i agree these tweaks to improve blackwood cause much more trouble than they save - it's like the difference betwenen 3014 and 1430|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Why Gabor?|pg||
nt|gulyas: he passes them too often:)|pg||
nt|petergill: The 3 declarers in Group B who have played 4@S so far have made it, with the clubs coming in. |pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Jan Jansma tells me 3@S is a strong relay whereas 3@H is a weak relay|pg||
nt|ppiglett: 3C not natural. With declarer showing his shape I suggest a diamond lead|pg||
nt|toral5: ok|pg||
nt|rhelle: otherwise you'd give up on slam and simply bid 4@d, I expect|pg||
nt|rhelle: 4@h, sorry|pg||
nt|robinswr: its much better for east to show nothing and just allow west to describe his hand|pg||
nt|toral5: how shall he play this?|pg||
nt|toral5: @D king and @C king?|pg||
nt|robinswr: needs to play trumps from dummy|pg||
nt|jillan:  see....|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Piece of cake now, but even without it when East has shown the majors|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Then he can advance the king from dummy. Does not matter if West wins the singleton ace. He has a marked finesse later|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Even the @DJ here won't fool Madala - he will know that East has an honour|pg||
nt|milton_se: that's why I agree w Jill about the 2C bid ...|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Presumably if all you guys are passing on East's actual hand, you also pass with QJ9xx-10xxxx-Jx-x|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Exactly|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That 2@C bid gave the show away|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I'm stubbornly with Bertheau.  Wonder how at many tables East will pass over 1@C|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You know it's not your hand, why tell the opponents how they should play it?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Thank you Roland :) I guess this is a recurring debate :)|pg||
nt|milton_se: and no disturbing effect at all -- just gives them an extra bid|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Surrender, Bill|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Never|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: lol|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I will fight you on the beaches, and elsewhere |pg||
nt|bjacobs: (since you are now in London ...)|pg||
nt|jillan:  and I will support your right to do so  :)|pg||
nt|milton_se: yeah, your beaches are safely far from here :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We don't have many beaches in London|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Let's not forget that it took Madala 30 minutes to bid 3NT|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: "I couldn't disagree with what you say more, but I will defend your right to say it till my death"|pg||
nt|milton_se: can't anyone tell Nyström that it's over?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Nystrom just asked Madala what 2@H/@S would be over 2@C|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: Third hand NV vs V it's different, I suppose|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer taking safety play in trumps|pg||
nt|koksoy: he  will  get  schocked  when  he  will  see  4-0 diamond  break  :)|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: a foolish result from a nothing hand|pg||
nt|toral5: ya|pg||
nt|toral5: now might 1100|pg||
nt|viren169: due to the 7 of clubs|pg||
pc|dA|nt|brolucius: 2@H is about 8-10 and he could downgrade such as @CQ-J doubleton. I don't think it is a bad response. |pg||
nt|hedyg: you know pd will not bid game with 14 opposite 2@H|pg||
nt|stc: he didn't make yet|pg||

nt|brolucius: East new the game was up (no pun intended) and cashed his available tricks.|pg||
nt|brolucius: ..knew..|pg||
nt|bagman: With better heart spots, South would have bid 3@H, I guess. He might also have done that vulnerable|pg||
nt|bagman: In the OR NS were forced to bid the laydown game|pg||
nt|paulg:  Precision bidding|pg||
nt|capercliff: well a big @c auction coming|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: Cliff, was it you saying 4@HX+1 would tie the match? :)|pg||
nt|capercliff: :)|pg||
nt|paulg:  Lauria and Versace seem to be playing a new defence to a strong club, based on canape overcalls|pg||
nt|andy_h: Bas, did South ask West of his preempting styles?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not Madala's set, 30 of the 31 IMPs were caused by wrong decisions |pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Nope, he just sat there and thought, playing the @C5|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: No kibs, I wasn't tricking you... I would|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: *I would've long undid it|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Undone even|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Or we could say that 30 of the 31 IMPs to Norway came after good decisions by Brogeland|pg||
nt|brolucius: 'How did you do in your match against Italy?'  'Let me show you a deal where I got Duboin three down in 3NT'.|pg||
nt|andyv:  I was impressed|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: lol|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: "What a player"|pg||
nt|andyv:  that he is:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 3NT is not a lucky contract this session, 80% of the times it was played it went down at this table|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Zivkovic left for the bathroom|pg||
nt|hedyg: strange pass by Versace this hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: would you pass?|pg||
nt|iain sime: Despite the opening lead accidents in the other room, Italy are building a substantial lead.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Perhaps 2NT is a better response (to a double of 1@D) than 2@H was. On the previous board. Those queens and jacks may play OK in NT.|pg||
nt|hedyg: how can one not bid ever with the W hand?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Surprising, as you say.|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok Gabor, i will never discuss any blackwood or keycard with you :)|pg||
nt|gulyas: I think you should play a simpler game, cicus:) you get excited too often over simple conventions|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: This was pretty funny. Dumbovich playing @HAK and Sementa saying "@HQJ partner" in Italian. Then declarer claimed and E assumed 7@H :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|athene: next month's Bridge World may seen an article from Fred, entitled "why conventions , especially texas transfers, are ruining the modern game"|pg||
nt|cicus: we keep it simple, Hedy :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|andyv:  a big pick up for Lebanon... interesting that their pick ups have been when they've been quiet:)|pg||

mb|1H|nt|brolucius: If there are any kibitzers staggered by the 0-0 scoreline, that is because there is no coverage of the Open Room and therefore no automatic scoring. |pg||

nt|Gerben42: a good hand for weak NT to stay low|pg||

mb|p|nt|capercliff: a @c lead was needed to beat 6|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@d= 5+@hs 4-18|pg||
nt|rodvenn: 2@c may be Drury or natural|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: That's true for any contract on any board, bridge is a 100% no luck game|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Contract bridge that is|pg||
nt|mamos: well  we might have forgiven Colin for doubling this one opposite a vul first in hand opener from part|pg||
nt|mamos: but then he has played with David a lot|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the NT games on 8 & 9 were a bit unlucky. the two subsequent ones were just bad contracts, even if one would rate to reach them|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i would say it is a better double than the one he actually did perpetrate|pg||
nt|skorchev: 1@D=11-17 hcp, 4+@D, unbal|pg||
nt|skorchev: 2NT = very weak or FG @D fit (tnx Rado)|pg||
nt|andyv:  this one should not be successful|pg||
nt|april7: E might end up here in an unmakable 3NT contract, but with 1NT answer by W if its not forcing might pass,otherwise they will reach 3NT|pg||
nt|athene: 2@D showed 8+ hcp, forcing to game if opener has the strong hand|pg||
nt|athene: i am told 3@C showed 4@S-5@H|pg||
nt|athene: south might have doubled 2@C there but it's a bit aggressive i guess|pg||
nt|ppiglett: as was suggested By guido Ferraro on Vugraph in Ostende, a high scoring match in Football is a potential sign of quality. Howvere the oposite applies in Bridge. 13-7 after 13 ...|pg||
nt|ppiglett: boards is good bridge|pg||
nt|toral5: 1@H is discouraging for east as finesses are LIKELY 2 fail|pg||
mb|5C|nt|bagman: Only lead not give away anything|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: lol|pg||
nt|capercliff: easily enough from the West hand|pg||
nt|paulg:  2@d is either a weak two in hearts or 5+@H with 18+ points|pg||
nt|sharkey: Surprised W didnt bid his @S suit OR|pg||
nt|brolucius: On a similar hand yesterday, David Greenwood was saying that he prefers a 1NT rebid on that East type. It seems to be a close decision between 1NT and 2@D, but I rather like 1NT.|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@H Precision 11-15|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this time they have stretched the odds|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: N explained it as just weak with @D|pg||
nt|rv: I expect Catalina to make it here|pg||
nt|toral5: so few more 4 iceland|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: Declarer is going to guess the trumps|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: That might be true, I'm being told no, nor the 2@C opening which would be 18-19 BAL|pg||
nt|bagman: because he can pick Qxxx from W but not from E unless he takes a direct finesse|pg||
nt|bagman: With the diamond lead it is possible that declarer plays spades from the top and relies on @C or @H|pg||
nt|iain sime: No, I would have bid 3@S. But two doubletons and an AK to lead and that is enough.|pg||
nt|andyv:  he certainly has that|pg||
nt|athene: north could have bid 2@H over 1@S perhaps|pg||
nt|tokay1975: that play was more  spectacular but  to get600  is more important for norberto|pg||
nt|hawe45:  PLus que cela - 50 pour la Dame de @C placÃ©e + A sec chez Est|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: The live score service seems still down  Teething problems i guess|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 5-0 would be evil. 4-1 is just poor|pg||
nt|mbruun: OK|pg||
nt|brolucius: West would have passed 1NT, as it happens, and they would have stayed at a more comfortable level.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Giorgio Mauri|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Hello everyone from Italy|pg||
nt|andyv:  with 10 and 2 9s almost too strong|pg||
nt|mamos: does declarer need to lead @hK to make this|pg||
nt|hedyg: surely that is intended as a joke|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: lol|pg||
nt|andyv:  what they lack in strength, they make up in numbers:)|pg||

nt|viren169: OMC|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: oops man overboard throw him a raft|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 2@c= gazzilli like|pg||
nt|jbgood: i think that is the only explanation - 2 @c shows 3 card Major support and 8 +(and never clubs)|pg||
nt|jbgood: if clubs, 2 NT is a transfer to that suit|pg||
nt|andy_h: One benefit of playing this is that you don't need another route to show a 3 card limit raise, but the downside of it is that it can hurt the tempo of your 2/1 auctions if it ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: happens to be a GF|pg||
nt|hedyg: now 5@c by S?|pg||
nt|hedyg: he really wants to protect the K@s|pg||
nt|stc: 800 available but hard to collect|pg||
nt|iain sime: 5@D ?|pg||
nt|hedyg: useless K@S...|pg||
nt|skorchev: yes, since he is passed hand, the GF option is hardly possible|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: What would 3@D and 4|pg||
nt|ziff:  12 boards in 75 minutes is pretty fast|pg||
nt|petergill: Versace has shown 5+ @S and |pg||
nt|petergill: 4+ @d and 3 cards in @H and |pg||
nt|petergill: 3 cards in @S I mean|pg||

pc|s5|nt|brolucius: South can place declarer with a double stopper in clubs and is considering if he can cast his net elsewhere.|pg||

nt|bagman: GIB suggest 12 tricks|pg||
nt|bagman: Now @SA, @C AK JT (@H discard), !JD and then heart finesse when in dummyt|pg||
nt|paulg:  GIB can take the heart finesse when the @dJ is ducked, as it can still play the diamonds for four tricks|pg||
nt|paulg:  More realistically, declarer will not be happy (yet)|pg||
nt|koksoy: but  in  practice  he  will play  clubs first  then diamond jack..  then try  for  dropping @D9  .. if  not try  for  heart finesse  for  the  9th  trick|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer probably plays AK of clubs|pg||
nt|paulg:  doubleton @cQ is about the only option to make it|pg||
nt|rv: sry Caterina, on @d lead, right play is to cash @SA before entering dummy with @HK and take @c hook even if @S honor doesn't fall|pg||
nt|viren169: He jumped - let him sink!|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Undo please|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Coffee...|pg||
nt|atabey: undo again pls|pg||
nt|drorp: not declerer will know how to play the diamonds, but since he lacks entries it might not help him|pg||
pc|h7|nt|atabey: for the turkish spectators: our women team is up 46-1 for now. I thk against the chech republic|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@c= good hand @S+@C|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I believe England lost a swing to Ireland last night when trumps broke 5-0 in a 6@C contract   |pg||
nt|brolucius: South must look for a card to suggest a diamond switch.|pg||
nt|bagman: He needs the doubleton @CQ |pg||
nt|petergill: in @S|pg||
nt|petergill: Pardon me, I am tired, it is late here|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: np Peter :)|pg||
nt|athene: north is wondering whether to return a diamond, i suppose, but i don't think that can gain very often|pg||
nt|athene: you need partner to have the @CA for a start|pg||
pc|h3|nt|othered1: Tis is pushy, but good @H spots and other good views may pull this through|pg||
nt|hedyg: only 2@H tricks|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@ds, 4@cs on a good guess|pg||
nt|hedyg: that is only 8|pg||
nt|bagman: In isolation the spade play should be @SK and then finesse(s)|pg||
nt|mbruun: Yes I remember not a sound overcall with a boring 5332 and a bad suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Silence was golden for Muller in the other room|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He passed in a flash|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In order not to risk further penalties|pg||
nt|rv: win @HA and cash @SA now|pg||
nt|yuval10: so, same lead, will it be the same play?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|marlowepi: as S has no 4th D, E is in control|pg||
nt|hedyg: if i would bid 2NT opps would take the 1st 5 @ss|pg||
nt|gulyas: I like the way this match goes - some pushes, some doubledigit swings to Hungary, some more pushes:)|pg||
nt|athene: well i suppose the same contract will be reached in the other room|pg||
nt|athene: with 15 hcp facing 10, all suits covered, and no great fit anywhere|pg||
nt|viren169: 2@C dbled making!|pg||
nt|viren169: on the last|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the contract was the same, except the other S made 2@CX sacre blue|pg||
nt|toral5: ouch..tht defense is worth seeing|pg||
nt|viren169: Gunnar is good... but not that good!|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|snetram:  remis|pg||
nt|hedyg: no entry to dummy|pg||
nt|stc: yes but if they play twice @c and @h S is endplay after the @d ruff|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes.|pg||
nt|skorchev: 3@D would be to play and 4@D some kind of invite, I guess|pg||
nt|andyv:  3|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|hedyg: OR same 3NT|pg||
nt|bagman: There are some chances for a 2nd trump trick for S|pg||
nt|frululu: and wd|pg||
nt|robinswr: with a singleton east should bid in balancing position but my guess is that he can't show minors|pg||
pc|c3|nt|Walddk2: NL and Russia lost 3VPs each yesterday for slow play|pg||
nt|bagman: With the setting trick in his hand S might have considered cashing it but there's really no way that the @HA can run away|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Vanuzzi has taken a bathroom break|pg||
nt|babs59: Italy gained again when North treated her red 5/5 as a multi 2|pg||
nt|babs59: so they played in 3@D rather than 3NT|pg||
nt|babs59: sensible treatment when you have multis - the singleton @SQ downgrades|pg||
nt|rv: well played|pg||
nt|jillan:  I am a girl, and I can see all 4 hands, so would only bid 2@S.... :)|pg||
nt|haans: now easy play in @D|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mamos: what if South had won Ace and played Diamond?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: lol Daniel|pg||
nt|athene: i guess 2NT is showing a good diamond suit  because 1@D can't have more than 17 points|pg||
nt|hedyg: try to sound impartial Daniel :)|pg||
nt|gulyas: sry, I hope u understand I root for my team|pg||

nt|athene: i think there is a case for opening that east hand 1nt, if you play 15-17|pg||
nt|athene: you are really stuck for a rebid if you open 1@H and partner bids 1NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Top 6 + the Netherlands qualify for the Bermuda Bowl next year. If NL are among the 6, seventh also qualifies|pg||
nt|april7: why not pass a passable bid|pg||
nt|athene: Lauria could definitely have passed 3@DX i think|pg||
nt|athene: he has pretty decent diamond support for a man who has shown 9 cards in the majors|pg||
nt|atabey: 3@d X was a good spot. what made lauria run from it?|pg||
nt|atabey: ok. I am told that 3@d was a relay. not natural|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|hedyg: same lead|pg||
nt|atabey: confirmed by the audiance. turkey 46 czech republic 1. for now. ladies match|pg||
nt|brolucius: Important to pick up every available trick in defence when opponents have 650 in the bag already.|pg||
pc|c4|nt|Vugraphznk: I am sorry, I lost play here, I'll claim the correct amount of tricks|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok|pg||

nt|hedyg: ok ty|pg||
nt|atabey: then its -1|pg||
nt|atabey: at least -1 I mean|pg||
nt|atabey: still a small swing for italy|pg||
nt|hedyg: Kandemir misguessed the @c and Madala switched to ..............10@s!|pg||
nt|othered1: Defense in other room was merciless after declarer misguessed @C|pg||
nt|andy_h: So, E-W seem to have handled the interference well as one generally needs to be prepared if you play any type of relay sequences|pg||
nt|xenya: it would be interesting to see 2@DXX -- but with S's diamond holding the chances of that are almost non-existent |pg||
nt|rodvenn: Brogeland played 3 times diamonds. Which must be the right defense|pg||
nt|wstuart: good def|pg||
nt|barnets: according to the running scores Italy now have a 17 vp lead over iceland 18 ocer polandand 20.5 over israel|pg||
pc|cA|nt|bogier: wszystko przez ocene K karo, który wydaje sie kiepski- a jest swietny|pg||

nt|athene: ok 3@D asking for shape?|pg||
nt|athene: so 3nt just showed 4-5-2-2 maybe|pg||
nt|atabey: this will go some down. its a matter of time only. can we assume how many down?|pg||
pc|c5|nt|capercliff: well done:)|pg||
nt|bagman: South tries for 2 down|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|brolucius: N/S play reverse count signals, so Bocchi has shown two hearts.|pg||
nt|brgpro: he has to duck again to give himself a chance although declarer can play @s and make this anyways|pg||
nt|andyv:  3@d probably invite... who knows what 4@d would be|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@H showed 3 spades (not 4) and not 4@D|pg||
nt|bjacobs: South's hand is pretty massive to just bid 2@S ... he can hope for a stiff club opposite|pg||

nt|sharkey: Cud be interesting...|pg||
mb|3H|nt|hedyg: take away his bidding box?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Yes, when the opps generally play slower than you it can be a pretty powerful weapon|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: It takes a lot of experience (which EW obviously have) to keep your own pace|pg||
nt|rodvenn: Madala seem not to be up to the standard of Brogeland yet. But he is young|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 25 I think|pg||
nt|bagman: I have no idea if it makes but let's see if EW bid it|pg||
nt|bogier: sytuacja nie jest taka prosta|pg||
nt|andyv:  NS can make 3@h|pg||
nt|pasker: S may have been tempted to open the bidding holding 2 aces and a king|pg||
nt|andyv:  S needs to get in the bidding|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1Nt isn't forcing|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @D multi,  wk 2 in a major |pg||
nt|barnets: easy for south to play a heart to satop any endplay|pg||
nt|athene: it's something you might need at any moment :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: rehi all. small hiccup there|pg||
nt|petergill: Dbl by the passed hand suggests both majors|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 1@H - 1@S - 2@D passed out rather inelegant|pg||
nt|rv: traditionalists will pass with South hand, very few will pass in today's bridge|pg||
nt|athene: 5@S isn't the most forward-going bid lauria could have made|pg||
nt|athene: so versace might let this go|pg||
nt|drorp: i think it's more than enough with his hand|pg||
nt|drorp: Versace has a decision to make|pg||
nt|drorp: 6@S isn't that good|pg||
nt|athene: hard to bid slam with nineteen plain-suit losers|pg||
nt|drorp: just works here|pg||
nt|athene: i guess versace is giving it a good look|pg||
nt|athene: this delay can't be Palma, can it?|pg||
nt|athene: his options over 5@S are: pass|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: od tego czasu zd¹zyli chyba zapomniec jaki kontralkt by³ grany|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I @H how penalty Xs are explained at this level|pg||
nt|rhelle: Maybe ... but I still think it's anti %|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West hoping for a re-opening double|pg||
nt|yuval10: hmmmm 3@h probably forcing|pg||
nt|toral5: north ll closely look :DID SOUTH OPEN?|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: you do a great job! my favorite operator :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Thanks :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: lol, that means a lot, given the amount of sessions I've seen you commentate, haha|pg||
nt|capercliff: that wasnt really a slow pass was it?|pg||
nt|haans: all the way i say|pg||
mb|3S|nt|Walddk2: Gazzilli I presume|pg||
nt|mbruun: Sp K is huge, but still 1 NT is stretchy|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: No, it wasn't|pg||
nt|capercliff: tx|pg||
nt|paulg:  of course the Scottish expectations for this match will be low so Piper does have free rein to try for a result|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I just figured that with all my typing I might as well enter the bidding real life when I'm typing :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: why did he pass?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Wasn't he the 15 year old wonder boy 10 years ago?|pg||
nt|bogier: ktr mog³aby doprowadziæ do sytuacji ¿e N podejmowa³by decyzjê na poziomie 4|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, for promotion, but he can do that no matter which trump trick he wins|pg||
nt|mamos: ah yes  he just didnt do it |pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: There is some kind of socialist festival going on outside with loud music, fire crackers and a small carnival|pg||
nt|brolucius: Some players use a new major at the two-level (facing a weak two-bid of some sort) to be invitational but non-forcing. In that way they can pick up the games where there is a fit ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: for responder's suit. A new suit at the three-level is forcing.|pg||
nt|petergill: Interesting (disciplined?) that Sementa chooses 3@D raise rather than direct 4@S|pg||
nt|petergill: I expected North to bid 5@C|pg||
nt|paulg:  Shields bids 2@s so that he can compete in hearts on the next round ... if there were one|pg||
nt|jkotor: inv or GF?|pg||
nt|lechcold: 2@H = zajmij BA|pg||
nt|yuval10: guess not|pg||
nt|peachy: I wouldnt think so|pg||
nt|peachy: but of course I dont know their agreement|pg||
nt|yuval10: interesting play to 3@h|pg||
nt|peachy: on range/ranges of 2NT|pg||
nt|haans: 2nt not as good as it was|pg||
nt|yuval10: if def. play AK@s and K@d....|pg||
nt|yuval10: declarer can't enter his hand to draw trumps|pg||
nt|viren169: Needs the J of diamonds to come down in 3|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|dougdscsu: really dont like pass with Piper's hand, hes got 9 hcp and support for partners suit..|pg||
nt|paulg:  i'm sure it was an 'action' pass|pg||
nt|andy_h: Looks like a swing for norway here|pg||
nt|brolucius: Neither East rates his hand as worth a 2@D bid to show a sound raise to 2@H. No, but it is around a maximum for the direct raise.|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@H is 7+|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I am being told Finnish and Hungarian have a shared ancestry, there you go kids, don't believe what you're being told :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  Italy chipping away at the lead with 2 imp gains on boards 7 and 8|pg||
nt|athene: normally when you push opps to the 5-level, you don't do anything after that|pg||
nt|athene: they might be one down; they might have missed a slam|pg||
nt|athene: you are in a really advantageous situation|pg||
mb|4C!|nt|Walddk2: 2@C either natural or any 16+|pg||
nt|bogier: troche zamieszania- Cezary walczy z w³asn¹ intuicj¹, która podpowiada³a mu skrecic w BA|pg||
nt|bagman: If @SK were wrong and the clubs very badly, declarer got from the lead a heart trick for his 10th trick|pg||
nt|mamos: perfect playing conditions for bridge|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I am sorry, sometimes bid don't register properly...|pg||
nt|cicus: that theory is already refuted|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: That's only proving my last point :)|pg||
nt|athene: if this auction was forced on EW by system it's not a great advertisement for polish club 1@C opener in competition, i don't think|pg||
nt|schtsch: noone will understand it but it could get them to slam|pg||
nt|schtsch: 1@s positive|pg||
nt|schtsch: 1nt relay|pg||
nt|schtsch: he bid balanced hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Palma had a swift pass, it was Versace thinking|pg||
nt|athene: right|pg||
nt|jkotor: 6@c?|pg||
nt|jkotor: wyrzutka kara na kiera|pg||
nt|jkotor: i dojcie pikiem do dobrego kara, ¿eby pika wyrzuciæ, ale to na widne|pg||
nt|jillan:  the Swedish women got 25 against France|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I'm guessing 2@H is a transfer - i.e. showing a spade raise of some sort|pg||
nt|milton_se: going for a beautiful slam ...|pg||
nt|milton_se: 2H is support|pg||
nt|jillan:  shows 4@S|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: If N can't keycard to 7 something is very wrong|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 2@H natural but denies 8+hcp|pg||
nt|capercliff: he might double if they reach 5@d?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: he is only 23 I hear, born 1987|pg||
nt|bagman: There were entry problems to go for that line and set up 3 heart tricks|pg||
nt|hedyg: as usual the @c suit got lost|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer is playing close to DD|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Sorry all, the OR crashed so we had to reestablish the link|pg||
nt|wstuart: this is a tough one. 2 controlish hands with the right doubletons opposite length in the other hand|pg||
nt|rnmalik: comes the @D switch.|pg||
nt|toral5: couple of imps 4 holland|pg||
nt|mdgraham: now, when 3NT comes back in the tray, East will know he's done the wrong thing|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: And not the @D9xxxx|pg||
mb|4H!|nt|andy_h: The 2@S opening did its job, with the 3@S adding more preemptive value|pg||
nt|lesniak: oczywiscie wist w trefla kladaie 3 ba ale kto to wymysli|pg||
nt|antoniz: please heart lead|pg||
nt|brolucius: And the @D suit.|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Don't NS play weak 2's?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Or did Madala judge it as too bad|pg||
nt|barnets: same contract|pg||
nt|petergill: North does not like to use the Pass Card unless he has to|pg||
nt|paulg:  as it happens, the double fit means that they have missed game|pg||
nt|koksoy: and  2@D  seems  natural...  because he  prefered to  bid 2@S  with  4-4  major|pg||
nt|bagman: Sementa's going to play a trump now|pg||
nt|schtsch: 3@d obviously his shape|pg||
nt|rv: I prefer 1n rebid with South hand with 5422 and min hand|pg||
nt|drorp: Lauria isn't sure he's making 5 yet|pg||

nt|toral5: and once @H q denied,@S king is marked wid pd...but stil some cards needed|pg||
nt|viren169: It is not a particularly good 7...|pg||
nt|viren169: it happens to make...|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 3@C natural, NF|pg||
nt|bagman: here there are 3 top tricks to lose and then declarer has to guess the trumps (which he will after this lead)|pg||
nt|antoniz: dobrze Rysiu:)|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: pañskie zyczenie jest rozkazem|pg||
nt|vasmar: E-W can make 3@D|pg||
nt|hedyg: not 2suiters, no|pg||
nt|petergill: Bas - when in doubt, assume that Ozols did not pass?|pg||
nt|athene: if east really has to jump all the way to 3nt just to show the strong hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  great dummy for N|pg||
nt|athene: versace assumed the 5@S bid was a club but not huge red-suit strength so there's strong likelihood of two red losers|pg||
nt|mdgraham: however, 2@c looks exquisitely reasonable|pg||
mb|4S|nt|hedyg: 2@H is wow|pg||
nt|paulg:  might double 3N|pg||
nt|hedyg: specs suggest he cannot play the hand if he raises |pg||
nt|capercliff: or 3N for a @s lead?|pg||
nt|mamos: 3NT was good i was just going to say   but  .....|pg||
nt|brolucius: Six cards, 4-10 points, on their card.|pg||
nt|hedyg: but E could have bid 2@d here|pg||
nt|hedyg: i really dont see why he didnt|pg||
nt|snetram:  kierowy atak stwarza problem|pg||
nt|jkotor: nasi ³adnie tutaj wistowali w Otwartym, ale RZG ustawi³ wpust|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@h was polish in OR on board 8... showed 5@h and 5 of other....5-11 hcp... she was max for her bid|pg||
nt|schtsch: 3@h asking controls or something|pg||
nt|wstuart: Does anyone know exactly what Croatia needs in this match to advance?|pg||
nt|schtsch: don't know their system, just guessing|pg||
nt|schtsch: 27:3 :)|pg||
nt|tokay1975: i thk  pass  was  pass  by versace |pg||
nt|toral5: he cant get to dummy:(|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: The players slice their necks with their hand :)|pg||
nt|viren169: on this layout|pg||
nt|haans: rkc?|pg||
nt|toral5: ya sd rkc in @H|pg||
nt|viren169: i which suit?|pg||
nt|viren169: in which suit|pg||
nt|haans: good q|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Interesting here is how does S cue @H and set @D as trumps at the same time?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: So 16-18 with spades and clubs|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Is there a brake pedal to this auction?|pg||
nt|sybarra: nice of @S's to be 3/3|pg||
nt|mbruun: North will probably lead a diamond against a spade contract, and the 3-3 break combined with good intermediates allows it to make|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Sementa could have passed 3@C|pg||
nt|mdgraham: he could have passed 1@S too|pg||
nt|mbruun: With a nondiamond lead declarer lacks an entry|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Indeed|pg||
nt|capercliff: 4@h is a good contract|pg||
nt|dougdscsu: still hope for italy, 2-1 now|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Thanks|pg||
nt|capercliff: and maybe 6@d on any lead other than a @h|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Won't tell him until the contract is over, dw Scots :)|pg||
nt|xenya: and a huge one|pg||
nt|bagman: Then, on the other hand, declarer might have lost a spade and two clubs with the heart|pg||
nt|stc: -5 possible|pg||
nt|hedyg: now J@C|pg||
nt|hedyg: well, only 50/ trick|pg||
nt|toral5: infact 1 imp.cant go less thn 2 down i guess|pg||
nt|milton_se: couldn't imagine the 5-card Cs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The Swedish women are indeed in the 25-2 VP range, but still 8 boards to go in the match|pg||
nt|toral5: rkcb in @H|pg||
mb|6S|nt|brolucius: Declarer must take steps to avoid two trump losers. Ace and low to the jack will work.|pg||
nt|brolucius: He can afford that safety play only when he knows that there are only two losers in the side suits.|pg||
nt|brolucius: With three side-suit losers he would have to play the A-K, hoping to drop a doubleton queen.|pg||
nt|atabey: very good pass by assael. could be a cold 4@h|pg||
nt|hedyg: did we miss out a double Bas?|pg||
nt|bagman: They are on their way. West seems to think that diamonds are solid (and they are :) )|pg||
nt|marlowepi: after the king of hearts drops the queen from N, there is a good case for swtiching tacks and knocking out the ace of clubs. you want to take the entry out of the hand that has the ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: long diamonds|pg||
nt|mamos: Pric wants more|pg||
nt|sybarra: but spades are 3/3 |pg||
nt|rv: I might have given false preference to 2@h with North hand if the auction proceeded as 1@h-1@S-2@d|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I'm not a traditionalist but would happily pass the S hand|pg||
nt|athene: *5@S bid was a club void|pg||
nt|atabey: versace has nothing extra to thk. even less then when he was bidding over 2@c|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: problemem tego rozdania jest na co zagra rozgrywajacy na impas damy karo czy na wyrobienie kara|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: 2NT 18-19|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Or rather, what is 4@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|atabey: for NS I mean|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I didn't see it, barring human error, no, no Xs|pg||
nt|atabey: probably yes|pg||
nt|hedyg: and it was for sure Sementa who bid 2@H? not Assael?|pg||
nt|atabey: what is 2@h by sementa otherwise|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: That I am sure of|pg||
nt|atabey: then 2@h was by assael for sure|pg||
nt|hedyg: double by Duboin seems pretty automatic after 2@d|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: That's correct, I might've missed it|pg||
nt|petergill: A boring game, 5@D would not be much of a save|pg||
nt|schtsch: denial now|pg||
nt|wstuart: I hear that Croatia needs 27:3 to have a fighter but it is still not sure then, depending on other matches|pg||
nt|toral5: is 4@D kickback?|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Lauria passed 2NT after the same start in the Open Room. |pg||
nt|hedyg: maybe|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: In any case, S declares 3@D :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|atabey: so duboin dbled. is that correct?|pg||
nt|andyv:  always tough to play them when you are in 6|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It would be a travesty if Duboin bid 4@S, North led a diamond, and 4@S got wrapped up|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is not down yet|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, I know it can be defeated but you don't always get the best defence|pg||
nt|mdgraham: might be difficult for NS to switch to hearts, after the 2@H bid by East |pg||
nt|bjacobs: The defence will need to grab their heart tricks when in with a spade (or earlier)|pg||
nt|toral5: duck|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: lol|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Well, you opened 1@H partially because of your distribution, right? Why then not bid that second suit?|pg||
nt|rv: Gabrielle used her women's instinct and made the wnning bid of 2@s|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: should have keycarded over 1@S imo|pg||
nt|haans: many bid a direct 4nt as 4 card B|pg||
nt|viren169: 5@S can determine the K of spades... but it wont help|pg||

nt|andyv:  let's see how W plays it|pg||
nt|bagman: It could go @HA, @DA, @C, @HK, @CQ and diamond finesse|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Barbosa has left for the bathroom|pg||
nt|drorp: I am told the same contract is played at the other room, so a push it seems|pg||
nt|rhelle: he's still likely to make it|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|brolucius: Not everyone would agree on whether 3@C is forcing after such a start. If it was, then a pass seems wiser.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No rush yet, but soon ....|pg||
nt|mbruun: May be difficult for defense to grab their heart tricks but seems like the only chance looking at dummy, when they can count nine tricks for declarer|pg||
nt|wstuart: thank you to all who provoded information|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - problem with 3 NT may be misfit when W has 5 @S|pg||
pc|h8|nt|sybarra: this will roll now |pg||
nt|marlowepi: it was always rolling i think|pg||
nt|sybarra: with ace of @D on side yes |pg||
nt|bagman: and planned that partner had something nice in hearts|pg||
nt|cumino: I think 2@s is correct, even with singleton by Partner you play better|pg||
nt|toral5: @S duck wd ve beaten by 2 i guess|pg||
nt|toral5: thn why are they trying so much?|pg||
nt|viren169: It is all done with a wing and prayer here|pg||
nt|haans: @SK or @HQ or just luck|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: WHY 7@D|pg||
nt|toral5: german fight back here|pg||
nt|toral5: @H q he DENIED responding 5@H|pg||
nt|toral5: so its the question of aqj @S or ak@S|pg||
nt|haans: @CJ as needed as @SK|pg||
nt|toral5: luckiest of grands.|pg||
nt|viren169: probably quite a nice pickup for Germany here.... I cant see 7 being bid at the other table...|pg||
nt|toral5: old bridge theory:1 bad brd follows other|pg||
pc|hK|nt|jtr: Maybe a pass of 2NT was the wisest action|pg||
nt|brolucius: We had five double-figure swings to Italy on the first six boards. Since then only a dribble of IMPs. A margin 51 or more is needed for a maximum win in VPs.   |pg||
nt|athene: the big question is whether 2nt would have shown the strong version of 1@C and been forcing|pg||

nt|Walddk2: No, especially if she is wearing high heels|pg||
nt|mbruun: Would you return the 5 or the 6 of hearts|pg||
nt|bjacobs: There are a number of clues, but that's all they are ... clues|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 5, playing 2/4|pg||
nt|mbruun: Its almost impossible for him after East has shown 5cH|pg||

nt|brolucius: East-West play Gazzilli, so 2@H was a limited rebid. (He would rebid 2@C on a stronger hand).|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and North might have three diamonds to cash|pg||
nt|athene: firstly, south might lead a club from Qxx|pg||

nt|andyv:  if you are the underdog, the N hand is one that you might want to play around with and open... maybe 3@d, or 1@d or even 1@h|pg||
nt|bagman: South might X the spade game|pg||
nt|bagman: he might not beat it|pg||

nt|jkotor: kierowy obk³ada, ale partner piki licytowa³|pg||
nt|toral5: dull 3nt here|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3NT for EW.|pg||
nt|toral5: frm d spectator point of view|pg||
nt|toral5: ohh|pg||
nt|toral5: should attack @H immediately the defenders|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: A@d and @s|pg||
nt|mbruun: Third quarter for Italy |pg||
nt|brolucius: Excellent work by Mossop! Many would go on bidding on that collection.|pg||
nt|petergill: In the World Rankings, the highest ranked Italian player in this team is Giorgio Duboin, ranked the 2nd best player in the world. The highest ranked Latvian in this team is ranked ...|pg||
nt|petergill: 684th in the world.  (My figures may be a few months out of date)|pg||
nt|athene: that was quite some 3@H bid, vul against not|pg||
nt|hedyg: 6@D is off on a @S lead|pg||
nt|snetram:  kierowy to poprawny atak|pg||
nt|athene: if 4@D is just a splinter, 4@S is a very big bid|pg||
nt|athene: basically if you make a cue which raises the level of the final contract, that should be a good hand|pg||
nt|drorp: now that he knows his A@D is worth nothing, he'd wish he could bid 4@H|pg||
nt|toral5: gud 4 kibs if i m eaten away.they ll get to see NICE BRDS.lol|pg||
nt|haans: will he not even if u feed him :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: I once made 3NT on just 24 points but I can't remember the hand now.|pg||

nt|Gerben42: who is  1? |pg||
nt|babs59: together with @SA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't agree with the jack. That will give her a losing option|pg||
nt|yuval10: S didn't play trump|pg||
nt|yuval10: probably sure that his P has a singelton|pg||
nt|peachy: this could end up as push|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphznk: The look on Versace's face in indescribable|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3Nt means interesting hand (@S are fixed)|pg||
nt|bagman: If EW bid in confidence, S should not X. If it's invitational, X would be fine|pg||
nt|hedyg: quite so!|pg||
nt|athene: after 4@S it's going to be hard to stop north|pg||
nt|atabey: barbosa is very happy now. showed clubs then short @d then void @d|pg||
nt|athene: if i were north i would bid a slam after hearing 4@S|pg||
nt|athene: i certainly wouldn't have bid 4@S as south|pg||
nt|drorp: that's why i prefer not to splinter with voids, singleton and void are totally different you can't have the same bid to show either of them|pg||
nt|atabey: he told everything he had. I'd pass in a sec|pg||
nt|athene: i agree it's very important to differentiate as quickly and clearly as possible between voids and singletons|pg||
nt|drorp: opposite singletong, south thought his hand is working well, only J@D wasted, and has a club fit, not that i agree with 4@S, but i can see why he thought about it|pg||
nt|athene: they just aren't the same :) not even close|pg||
nt|april7: the 4 @S bid might be the ace ,then N has a difficult decision|pg||
nt|drorp: also, his pass on the double already showed a minimal balanced hand... otherwise he could bid 2@H\3@C|pg||
nt|athene: 5@D exclusion might have worked - south bids 5@H saying no keycards outside diamonds, end of story|pg||
nt|drorp: XX\whatever|pg||
nt|drorp: 5@H is too high already|pg||
nt|drorp: i think N should pass|pg||
nt|drorp: why did u bid 5@D if you're not passing 5@H?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Barbosa bid 6@H and Lauria has called the TD|pg||
nt|toral5: on target |pg||
pc|dA|nt|brolucius: North considering a pass. Yes, he has passed.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bill, remember to tune in for the cricket in 30 mins|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 9-0 at the moment|pg||
nt|bjacobs: too tired, too uninterested|pg||
nt|bjacobs: There's something a bit wrong with this auction ...|pg||
nt|bridge_one: after passed hand right to give the chance to play slam|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Madala apologising now|pg||
nt|petergill: Should North do more? South?|pg||
nt|athene: if he heard 5@S he would bid 5NT grand slam force|pg||
nt|athene: maybe 5@H very slow and lauria thinks north has to pass it|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I daren't say|pg||
pc|d2|nt|andyv:  EW are one pair that always bids in confidence:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I suspect neither would South|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I thought it was because of the salary|pg||
nt|bjacobs: well, that too|pg||
nt|jillan:  on board 13 the Swedes stopped in 1@S made 2 and Sweden got 7 imps|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Bocchi showing his hand but not claiming...|pg||
nt|jillan:  the match is now very even|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Thinking the claim over|pg||
nt|sharkey: ty Andy - explains it|pg||
pc|d7|nt|Walddk2: Yes I am|pg||
nt|brolucius: I look forward to it.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Just waiting for David to send me an invitation for lunch|pg||
nt|jtr: Dont hold your breath|pg||
nt|othered1: Note that Duboin stayed out of the auction, despite vulnerability.  West's action in OR bought -800, abetted by east.|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: *is|pg||
nt|toral5: haans u really want me to get killed:):(|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and Marc Smith. That could be fun|pg||
nt|brolucius: Consider yourself invited (after the world cup is over).|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer is going to take his finesses in the majors and ends up with 10 or 11 tricks|pg||
nt|bagman: A spade to the 9 now?|pg||
nt|bagman: and then heart?|pg||
nt|paulg:  hard to believe that the cards could lie so well|pg||
nt|drorp: yeah 5@H was quite slow, but normal tempo in slam bidding|pg||
nt|atabey: lots of specs saying 4@s is a way overbid. I agree. even @d shortness is good you have to have some points also :)|pg||
nt|athene: this might be only a small loss, though|pg||
nt|athene: might be 5@H-1 in the other room|pg||
nt|april7: I think the 4 @S bid was to much for N to bear|pg||
nt|athene: yes, you are forcing to a slam with north after 4@S|pg||
nt|athene: well i am :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: It won't matter much in the end, since 6@H will go down|pg||
nt|athene: maybe i had better not play with Palma|pg||
nt|atabey: so I have to take it back what I said about N|pg||
nt|athene: but i would not have responded 2@C; i would have shown heart support first round|pg||
nt|april7: if you can show a void and support in @H, but a splinter(singleton) is not enough|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Versace asking Palma about other bids Barbosa could've made|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5@H made in the other room after a spade to the ace|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That set up the queen for a club pitch|pg||

pc|sA|nt|bjacobs: 3@S is not in any way invitational is it?  So is North allowed to bid 4@S?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Something is an underbid|pg||
nt|antoniz: dobrze idzie|pg||
nt|pasker: that lead should help|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|iain sime: Should be 1100  |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Everyone knows hos the cards lie in a second|pg||
nt|Walddk2: (no club)|pg||
nt|hedyg: he might regret that J@S|pg||
nt|athene: yes i didn't mean makeable necessarily i mean they might get bid|pg||
nt|cicus: I wonder why W overtook, he could have gone to hand with a @D|pg||
nt|athene: i am told france brought home 6@S|pg||
nt|schtsch: with only 2VPs available for croatia here|pg||
nt|april7: big swing then for Italy|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|vasmar: there was a safe heart lead for N |pg||
pc|s7|nt|Walddk2: Thank you|pg||
nt|petergill:  1 is Fulvio Fantoni, pushed up by his World Pairs win in 2002|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|hedyg: if 2NT could be this weak E had no business bidding 5@d|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@d by N in OR was unusual vs unusual|pg||
nt|othered1: Maybe they don't have a narrow range for the action at this vul and east was taking a general direction shot.  But double of 3@D might bring partner back in on the right hand.|pg||
nt|hedyg: France is killing Lithuania, so far 51:1 after 13 bds|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bridge_one: the lead help|pg||
nt|bagman: Now this is more or less over. declarer has many ways for 10 tricks and some for 11|pg||
nt|brolucius: Madala is looking around for an Undo button. 'Sorry, I don't know what happened. Obviously I meant to pass over 5@D.'|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|stc: E has better majors|pg||
nt|stc: As I heard on BBO:"my daughter bounced my arm"|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: lol|pg||
nt|hedyg: cannot use that excuse in Ostend|pg||
nt|brolucius: Mind you, who can say that 5@H was wrong? He could have ended up being a hero if the North and East hands were adjusted a bit.|pg||
nt|hedyg: 56:1 sry|pg||
nt|cicus: now has to settle for 11 tricks as a @H ruff would make N's @S87 a trick|pg||
nt|jkotor: szansa na -2|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer's best chance to make the contract is the same as playing for max|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|paulg:  this is an important match for Wales as they are currently lying 9th in the standings and the last qualifying spot, just 8VPs clear of tenth|pg||
nt|marlowepi: these two countries both claim nationality credit for Marco Polo|pg||
nt|rnmalik: wd|pg||
nt|haans: :) would be interesting|pg||
pc|s9|nt|mamos: I still think that transfer is their defence to strong Club (which Simpson Price are not playing)|pg||

nt|mdgraham: Sure North is allowed to. Whether it is wise to do so is a different matter|pg||
nt|xenya: good @D switch -- Italy is likely to pick 2 imps here|pg||
nt|andy_h: Not much to this hand. Declarer's thinking suggests that he is trying to protect against any foul breaks which is what you want to do in case it happens|pg||
nt|bagman: The @CA is marked south|pg||
nt|bagman: So is the @SK with some confidence|pg||
nt|athene: the italian NS did very well to reach 4@H on 13|pg||
pc|c2|nt|bjacobs: Suspect the problem is the 2@S bid|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I play Gametry XX here, so 3@S is just stonewalling opps|pg||
nt|Gerben42: also Italian - they have a lot of players to pick from|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Tough for N to keep his @H though|pg||
pc|c9|nt|sybarra: maybe they play it over any club|pg||

nt|capercliff: the 10@h would have been a great card to find|pg||
nt|toral5: haha|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Conclusion: Les kibbs sont forts|pg||
pc|s4|nt|jtr: Looks like this is going to drift a few off at least|pg||
nt|othered1: And AKxx of their likely trumps is a lot better for defense than offense.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If they are married, as Mike suggested in the beginning, he will hear about it all evening and night|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And Sementa finds a truly evil defensive play, putting South under all sorts of pressure|pg||
nt|sybarra: I suspect they have sorted this out much earlier than now |pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I think they are btw, same rings though she has it on her right hand and he on his left|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer has quite a good count of the hand and can go for the line to make 11 tricks|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Anyone for some ping pong?|pg||
nt|hedyg: good defense by E|pg||
nt|Walddk2: N and W might just as well fold their cards|pg||
nt|stc: In the USBC trails Moss-Gittelman payed 2200 in -5xx, this one will be cheaper |pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: Unless he knows S guards the @C|pg||

nt|hedyg: not 2, not 3|pg||

nt|brolucius: A conservative assessment.|pg||
nt|bagman: Playing 5@C, what would you do on a diamond lead?|pg||
nt|pasker: N may open 3@D here and is likely to play there|pg||
nt|bagman: Might W X?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: may South pass ? :)|pg||
nt|athene: north had better not do something silly like lead away from a king on opening lead|pg||
nt|paulg:  They are a very small bridge nation and it would be a first|pg||

nt|babs59: except Norway Germany is only board 8!|pg||
nt|petergill: North has redoubled, so full credit to Alfredo Versace for not reopening|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you might try 2NTas South, but it's only 9 hcp, and the singleton heart isn't exactly a bonus|pg||

nt|babs59: often it's the negative after overcalls|pg||

nt|andyv:  W has easy @s lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  and can probably switch to @d without much ado|pg||
nt|skorchev: usually pass followed by DBL shows 9-11 hcp, balanced hand without fit|pg||
nt|fabsayc: diamond switch is 7 for declarer|pg||
nt|koksoy: who  afraids vulneribility  and  lack  of  points ??  not  Duboin|pg||
nt|paulg:  North's 4@s is reasonable, but not what South wanted to hear|pg||

nt|koksoy: pass  is  ok..|pg||
nt|bagman: Any move and NS go minus|pg||
nt|paulg:  at this vulnerability the ace of hearts may be opposite void|pg||
nt|koksoy: sometimes S has 11  winners  but  its good  to  play  9 or  10  for  him|pg||
nt|koksoy: 8 or 9|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphznk: I liked the one against us as well, Roland ;)|pg||

nt|brgpro: let's not talk about football...the chinese team didnt even qualify from Asia...|pg||
nt|hedyg: just claim 11 and next|pg||

nt|dougdscsu: what an exciting week in both bridge and sports worlds|pg||
nt|bagman: W is going to try a surprise spade lead|pg||
nt|bagman: Here the size matters, is he going to lead the A?|pg||
nt|brolucius: South surely has nothing to think about, it must be West thinking.|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Never mind me, I counted 9 @Cs|pg||
nt|athene: ok - it's a bit more serious than that - it takes club lead and immediate diamond shift to beat, i think|pg||

nt|ziff:  In the race for the qualifying positions the first 7 teams in this group should be fairly safe by now, with Wales, Norway, Hungary, Latvia and Croatia fighting it out for the last two spots.|pg||
nt|athene: south can do something to ask for a heart|pg||
nt|athene: ok|pg||
nt|athene: i think you should only pass these doubles with some values|pg||
nt|toral5: muller did find a gud bal in the form of 2@S|pg||
nt|toral5: 3 also should make|pg||
nt|robinswr: when your partner balances, you need lots of extras to continue |pg||

nt|brolucius: Better to not qualify than to reach South Africa and play like idiots.|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: I'd feel more comfortable bidding 1@S and raising @H after that, wouldn't that describe my hand better?|pg||
nt|brgpro: well, versace did the same but Lauria just gave it a try then signed off when pd said so|pg||
nt|brolucius: I will not be adding this bidding method to my card.|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Icemen are fearless. As soon as there is a game in sight .....|pg||

nt|mdgraham: to be fair, on a different lead it would have been a 5 or 7 hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: rofl|pg||
nt|paulg:  Also partner could have bid 6@d himself .. you have shown values with 4@s|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 15: The reopening Dbl has led Italy to 4@h at the other table|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Wales, eh? :)|pg||
nt|wstuart: this may well be a huge swing|pg||

nt|bagman: Reminds of the meckwell deal against pakistan some (30) years ago|pg||

nt|brolucius: Again it must be West thinking at this point. The bids are made in pairs, each side of the screen.|pg||
nt|bogier: system kanape?|pg||
nt|athene: i imagine the way to make this is get the clubs going fast for diamond discards|pg||
nt|athene: but i think declarer might have to be looking at all four hands to find the winning line|pg||
nt|koksoy: look  at  the  methods ..  how  you  can  find a  game  after 15-17  nt  opening  as  Ýtalians  did|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: Italy would not want their "5" match to count for Carryover and some 20+ matches to be excluded, I doubt they're intentionally dumping|pg||
nt|wstuart: however, there has been a fair amount of thought given to tournament formats which reduce the incentive/ability for "Sportsmanlike Dumping".|pg||
nt|marlowepi: croatia has offered to share the Glagolitic script with Italy in exchange for 30 IMPs|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: Lauria needs to set up the @S suit for @C, and possibly, @D discards|pg||
nt|robinswr: too many club losers to make|pg||
nt|toral5: actually he cant make even if @S is ducked|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I think he's got some entry issues as well, since he needs to draw trumps and ruff @Ss in hand...|pg||
nt|robinswr: he should win ace of spades and switch to the king of diamnds|pg||
nt|toral5: problm is 3rd @S is getting over ruffed.|pg||

nt|toral5: interchange the minor aces.not leading a @D cd ve cost|pg||
nt|robinswr: if spades are 2-2 maybe he has to duck|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: It seems Paulissen went at the @S suit immediately instead of playing trumps first as Lauria did. This enabled the defenders to ruff a @D and make @SQ|pg||

nt|babs59: I thought we'd lost you to the wee hours Andy|pg||
nt|andyv:  no, just looking at the hands.. didn't seem like there was much to them|pg||
nt|babs59: what's the time for you?|pg||
nt|babs59: 3am?|pg||
nt|andyv:  3:15am|pg||
nt|babs59: West is just deciding whether the spades can cash|pg||
nt|babs59: either that or she's stressing South?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: That's dedication Andy|pg||
nt|andyv:  with that suit in dummy?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: S reading the Daily Bulletin now :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
nt|babs59: ah, no stress :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  the insomniac coup|pg||
nt|babs59: I was playing a Zonal v. New Zealand and my opponent took 25 minutes at trick 1|pg||
nt|babs59: then played the worst card|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|bagman: Now West needs to go up and attack clubs|pg||
nt|hedyg: nice contract|pg||
nt|paulg:  with the British Andy Murray winning (he only becomes Scottish when he loses), Italy going out of the World Cup, perhaps a Scotland win here would be the lead in tomorrow's papers|pg||
nt|cicus: I can see an overtrick|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: Roland Wald|pg||
nt|fabsayc: at BAM you want to be in 3NT on this board|pg||
nt|petergill: Well stopped, with the five level being very dangerous |pg||
nt|rv: good nite Gary|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: cheers|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 48 minutes left for 3 more boards|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: And this one, of course|pg||
pc|s6|nt|vugraphznk: Roland has eyes everywhere...|pg||
nt|athene: hard for west to duck the club perhaps but it would have made things harder for declarer |pg||
nt|daman: a@H play now might be fatal|pg||
nt|athene: declarer now has some transportation to untangle his black tricks|pg||
nt|athene: four clubs, two spades, and the red aces is still only eight though|pg||
nt|athene: double dummy he can make quite easily by dropping the @HJ of course|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@s showed 2 keycards and cuebid in @s|pg||
nt|paulg:  nice contract but potential gain of 2 imps if Scotland bid the inferior 6@s|pg||
nt|hedyg: a lauria speciality|pg||
nt|bagman: Now @CA and trouble|pg||
nt|bogier: a u nas juz trenuje ekipa operatorów na przysz³oroczne ME w Poznaniu :)|pg||
nt|antoniz: ju¿ zaczêli trykaæ,tak trzymaæ|pg||
nt|athene: he can put north in with a heart to play a spade back|pg||
nt|athene: but then lauria will probably hold up in spades, test clubs, and as a last resort just play north to have the heart and nothing else, which works|pg||
nt|drorp: ducking again is not a bad idea|pg||
nt|athene: so i think nine tricks will come from two spades, three diamonds, three clubs and one heart|pg||
nt|drorp: then taking the 3rd, crossing to partner with @H and spade through, will make it very difficult for declearer|pg||

nt|athene: diamond to jack i guess|pg||
nt|haans: remove trumfs|pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: but i don't see why he should find that|pg||
nt|bogier: znowu przed [parti¹|pg||
nt|stc: Madala is learning fast, this time he passed :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Madala has had enough of making risky heart bids.|pg||
nt|hedyg: pay-back time |pg||
nt|bogier: spryciarz|pg||
nt|paulg:  Madala and Bocchi bidding every possible game at the moment and finding a perfect lie of the cards|pg||
nt|bagman: Now the rest is about overtricks|pg||
nt|babs59: so at trick 2 she took another 10 minutes!|pg||
nt|toral5: how ll u play aftr a @H lead?duck and thn finesse @C 10?|pg||
nt|lesio: 2@H oznacza chyba ze mam starsza 4 a 2@S pyta dalej|pg||
nt|kamyk: ale cos zmienili - pzxedtem grali inaczej -2@H obiecywa³o starsz¹ czwórkê (nieznana)|pg||
nt|athene: get those hearts away fast|pg||
nt|henryb:  good Morning; this final contract is not an advertisement for the Nystrom-Bertheau system|pg||
pc|s4|nt|brolucius: Yes, he has always been interested in coffee.|pg||
nt|jtr: But usually focussed on Lavazza girls|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|bagman: I think that Madala made up his mind about the hearts|pg||
nt|rodvenn: it surely must  be reight to save a tick. Well done charlsen|pg||
nt|rodvenn: trick|pg||
nt|gulyas: maybe he should play on @Ds|pg||
nt|cicus: hmm, this was not urgent|pg||
nt|gulyas: do they lead 4th best?|pg||
nt|hedyg: he was in dummy, what should he play?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: NS lead odd|pg||
nt|drorp: but indeed, 1 way or another, declerer will make 9 tricks |pg||
nt|atabey: I'm not so sure. this can easily go down|pg||
nt|robinswr: or a soccer match|pg||
nt|toral5: now trump 7 becomes a high value card|pg||
nt|robinswr: lauria is still not cold|pg||
pc|d6|nt|athene: heart to the @HQ and @HK|pg||
nt|athene: and now it looks percentage to finesse the ten|pg||
nt|daman: yes|pg||
nt|athene: unblock @SK first|pg||
nt|athene: still lauria has a bit of a habit of making these contracts, so let's see....|pg||
nt|athene: Lauria might suspect that west has the @HK|pg||
nt|athene: otherwise why no heart back after the @CK>|pg||
nt|athene: ?|pg||
nt|athene: but even if he knew that, i don't see how it would really help that much|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps he will cash the @SK then run the clubs and judge whether to exit @SA, spade|pg||
nt|Walddk2: apart from the overtrick of course|pg||
nt|babs59: THAT was tough to remain focused|pg||
nt|athene: worry about drawing trumps later|pg||
nt|toral5: lot of work yet to be done|pg||
pc|d5|nt|Walddk2: Bas will insert result on 16 when he gets a minute. Please be patient|pg||
nt|xenya: now comes the guess|pg||
nt|athene: would east really lead from @CQ? he has been leading quite passively in general|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Last time he had that guess, the king was right, now it's not|pg||
nt|xenya: not easy|pg||
nt|barnets: west might have played the @CQ|pg||
nt|athene: north knows that east has a totally safe diamond lead, with no top honour|pg||
nt|athene: so the club lead looks more likely to be a singleton|pg||
nt|barnets: on the opening lead|pg||
nt|barnets: surely then dec would misguess|pg||
nt|athene: yes, @CQ at trick 1 might help proceedings along|pg||
nt|barnets: thinking east had the @CJ|pg||
nt|athene: maybe it's a double bluff - if you play the @CJ, you can't have QJ, because everyone falsecards with that|pg||
nt|barnets: this is a situation doesnt harm to falsecard partner|pg||
nt|xenya: but E is more likely to lead from Q than J|pg||
nt|xenya: so the Jack was probably the right card to play |pg||
nt|athene: apparently blakset is in the audience here! that must give him an edge|pg||
nt|athene: pity he is dummy|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Actually.... he just left for the bathroom lol|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: :)|pg||
nt|barnets: well its not given him an edge so far|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jtr: Now maybe an overtrick?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that's a relief, then|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That's a "half is glass full" theory Roland by the look of it|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@d would have been 1 or 4, not showing cue in @d|pg||
nt|bagman: hoping that partner has 2 trump tricks|pg||
nt|athene: i am told he has a brother|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|brgpro: he will get one for sure|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you don't want too many good results like this, though|pg||
nt|andyv:  one specs chimes in with they've been told not to double.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Bridge World has been discussing this issue for decades i believe|pg||
nt|drorp: even if now A@D, @H to Q, and @S, he can duck, take the 3rd, cash the diamond, cash 3 clubs, and play K@H, N is only left with hearts|pg||
nt|atabey: heart and spade back|pg||
nt|atabey: problem|pg||
nt|drorp: again, he can duck it|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: interesting he didn't unblock the spade - now a club return is very bad surely|pg||
nt|bagman: I cannot believe that Tesla ducked the diamond to the danger hand|pg||
pc|cT|nt|pasker: S can then play the 4th round of clubs to promote his 7 of trumps|pg||
nt|yuval10: now it's getting interesting|pg||

nt|athene: although NS have done well to organise the clubs so south doesn't get endplayed|pg||
nt|cicus: but what does S discard?|pg||
nt|athene: yes but if you exit a heart now, what does south throw?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: If he plays @SA @S, he'll have 2@S and 2@D + 5 = 9?|pg||
nt|athene: south is squeezed in three suits|pg||
nt|schtsch: one off????|pg||

nt|andy_h: make sure you have clear agreements of when it applies and which suit does it imply|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Director has been called|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Apparently Bocchi held the @s9 before leading a @D|pg||
nt|Walddk2: what now?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Hofta called the TD|pg||
nt|andy_h: held or led?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Did his partner see @S9?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: According to Bocchi he held, according to Hofta he put it on the table, the tray was closed at the time|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: The tray was only opened after the @D lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So what is the problem?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Chaos describes it aptly atm|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Tray = screen|pg||
nt|andy_h: if the screen was closed then there should not be a problem at all. This is one of the main advantages of playing behind screens!|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: According to Hoffa, Bocchi almost put down the @S9, he wanted to put dummy down and then Bocchi changed the card|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So facts are disputed|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It happens|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I, personally, didn't see a card before the @D|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I'm not sure if Bocchi has disputed showing the @S9 as a lead to Hofta|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In those situations, the TD *can* ask a spectator if he so wishes, but it rarely happens|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: He did|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bas is a spectator in this context|pg||
nt|rodvenn: this is being discussed now in the press rooms with very good expert TDs present|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Please kibs, I am impartial in this, I'm only reporting what I see and hear at the table, I have no hidden agenda|pg||
nt|rodvenn: they think the 9 of @s may be a playd card|pg||

nt|bagman: in the days of old when vugraphs were theaters one of my frinds was playing a tough contract. In a critical situation he heard the chanting from the theatre: "DROP IT, DROP IT" and ...|pg||
nt|bagman: played for the drop|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the best result is 4@D dbl less 1 = -100|pg||
nt|pasker: I think W was likely to bid at all vulnerabilities|pg||
nt|bagman: Here my suggestion did not help N|pg||
nt|brolucius: There have been some instructive bidding boards. Perhaps the most valuable lesson is that you should not take a gamble that is destined to lose.|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@D= a major suit|pg||
nt|yuval10: 3@h probably invitational|pg||
nt|toral5: he invites with such a terrible suit?|pg||
nt|toral5: and 10 hcps?|pg||
nt|athene: just what south didn't want to hear|pg||
nt|athene: this sort of decision might drive him back to the bathroom|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@D=0-8 5M+4m|pg||
mb|2S|mb|3S|nt|brolucius: I wonder how many teams contain a sponsor. The round-robin format makes that a more difficult proposition than it would be in such as the Bermuda Bowl. That is one reason why the ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: USA have a poor record in the bridge Olympiad.|pg||
nt|andy_h: 1NT = (14)15-17|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Bocchi tried to Charlsen, who stated he didn't mind. Then Hoffa asked for the screen to be closed|pg||
nt|sharkey: Canape style OR may have complicated matters|pg||
nt|petergill: A spec wisely pointed out that 12-15 is too wide as a 1NT range = very good point - that was part of the problem|pg||
nt|schtsch: i don't think bad is the right word for that|pg||
nt|toral5: pd can b as gud as @H void|pg||
nt|athene: i guess he decides that overtricks in 1@SX aren't as bad as what might happen if he bid|pg||
nt|robinswr: 1nt is 12-15 so 1club has to be bid with stronger hands|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Where's Rob when we need him? :)|pg||
nt|toral5: ya.but 15-15 is NOT gud news for italy as far as turkey is destroyed by israel|pg||
mb|d|nt|mdgraham: no raise to 3@H from North|pg||
nt|mdgraham: four trumps to the queen and an ace....|pg||
nt|bjacobs: shell shocked perhaps|pg||
nt|bjacobs: it can happen|pg||
nt|antoniz: p³askie -1|pg||
nt|barnets: looks like dec can make all 6 spades here to bring home 10 tricks|pg||
nt|mdgraham: (at this vul. It's a bit stronger vulnerable :))|pg||
mb|4H|nt|bjacobs: I like 3@H - sort of offering a choice of contracts.  East has already shown his heart stopper, presumably|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: Anyone else here with knowledge of Tarzan Precision?|pg||
nt|milton_se: now a few rounds of relays|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Let's hope this is a better advertisement|pg||
nt|bjacobs: wake me up when it's over|pg||
nt|henryb:  I hope so also|pg||
nt|yuval10: E won't be denied|pg||
nt|yuval10: he's defending his P who can be relatively strong|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: not sure Duboin is all that keen on it|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Me too|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: *tried to apologise to|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: So much to type...|pg||
nt|andy_h: According to the K&R Evaluator, West's hand comes to 12.20.  http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=QJ9+Q7+KQ743+KJ10|pg||
nt|stc: The so-called MultiLandy, very more and more popular|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2NT is four card heart raise|pg||
nt|bagman: Philosophical question, with a hand that bad as S has, showing 12 cards instead of 5 with a single call might be a good policy|pg||
nt|petergill: North did well to bid 3@H opposite 14-16|pg||
nt|mdgraham: won't matter here, but you can play transfers after that sort of overcall, to get the stroing NT hand being declarer.|pg||
nt|yuval10: 4@s too.... but can't see any play for 4@h|pg||
nt|toral5: so unfortunate tht @C are blocked|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: S has too much to pass :(|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: An other argument of the Italians was that Hoffa should've called the TD before the screen was opened if he felt wronged|pg||
nt|brolucius: South's 2@H was to play in partner's major. That is why North did not pass - South had not shown hearts.|pg||
nt|hedyg: @d lead and a @C back?|pg||
nt|iain sime: Woolsey I think is another name for it.|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I always thought the only difference between ML and Cappeletti is the reverse of 2m (2@C in Cap is the 2@D in ML), is that true?|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@S = some sort of good raise to 4@H|pg||

nt|jillan:  the 1D is either 0-4 or a GF|pg||
nt|jillan:  1@H shows any 20+|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So far, West has bid diamonds, notrumps and notrumps - such a perfect description of his hand!|pg||
nt|milton_se: y, isn't it!|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Someone would turn in his grave|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bertheau is relaying|pg||
nt|sharkey: think he'll |pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Only one win, I think.|pg||
nt|rodvenn: What the experts say here is that the fact that the screen is down does not automatically give Bocchi the right to change.  |pg||
nt|Walddk2: No|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I've seen players change cards and calls behind screens, I'm not sure if that's in accordance with the rules though|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes Iain, depending which side of the water you are on :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2@C used with only 3 trumps|pg||
nt|rv: Swiss ladies could lose another IMP here if Italians take their top tricks|pg||
nt|toral5: he ll b forced to win and play @S|pg||
nt|jillan:  any 20+ or 5+ hearts 16-19|pg||
pc|cA|nt|hedyg: lucky 3NT with no entry to the W hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes and another hand with little to comment on|pg||
nt|babs59: yes correct - but I guess you can correct the score for us?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: There is no reason to|pg||
nt|marlowepi: at the point where heart queen was led, it was not unreasonable to play small. he had to take pitch earlier|pg||

nt|marlowepi: yes|pg||
nt|yuval10: now he's down|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @CA, small @H to K! and @SK|pg||
nt|toral5: he was always down..|pg||
nt|toral5: ONLY bid i know in it is 1@C-1@H=4 or more @S:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He will get shape and number of zz's, and bid the slam|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A = 3  K = 2  Q = 1|pg||
nt|henryb:  and they would claim that it is all natural|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He will even know where the two kings are|pg||
nt|bjacobs: By the way, there's a book everyone should buy that says many interesting things, including about relay systems|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's called Bridge at the Enigma Club, by Peter Winkler, and it's a must read|pg||
pc|cT|nt|bjacobs: He isn't, but if partner is moving away from NT, Duboin will agree |pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: If E did intend 3@H to let W choose, W didn't take it that way|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Why not?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Didn't he choose?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: He just said 3@H probably was half a stop|pg||
nt|bjacobs: oh|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Denying 4@S anyway|pg||
nt|andy_h: But that doesn't refrain them from the 1NT opening - they also have another edge, that is, it is pre-emptive. If you hover your mouse to the open room score on the top-left, you ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: can see the auction from the Open Room. Versace also opened it 1NT|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Usually, when a player decides to allow/disallow a screenmate to change a call/card, it's dependant on personal relations|pg||
nt|sharkey: not sure - but West's raise to game seems very conservative|pg||
nt|Gerben42: even have time to let the strong hand play it|pg||
nt|cicus: another struggle for 9 tricks is coming|pg||
nt|bagman: MIght treat that Kxxxx as a 4-carder|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: wywolawczoæ kontry nabiera rozmiarów AIDS - kontrakt 2 karo z kontr¹ jest tego przykladem|pg||

nt|yuval10: probably 1 or 2 off|pg||
pc|c7|nt|hedyg: why not bid 2NT?|pg||
nt|daman: good bidding|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Oh well, it was a fine auction, even if a misunderstanding|pg||

nt|snetram:  kusi przepuszczenie kiera|pg||
nt|hedyg: no Bas|pg||

nt|hedyg: same lead as OR|pg||
nt|lechcold: kontra by³a nadwy¿kowa (2@D s³abe dwa), ale zg³oszenie 4@H przez Berseta to chyba przesada|pg||
nt|athene: yes, make six spades, @DAQ, @CK, @HA = ten tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Lars thought that passing would be the cheapest option for his side, but I really don't think you should pass|pg||
nt|xenya: so perhaps Blakset was right|pg||
nt|barnets: he had to play i think @S 9 @S Q the a club|pg||
nt|barnets: @DQ and @DA are two entries for two ruffs|pg||
nt|barnets: and then he exits with the 4th @D|pg||
nt|barnets: that would give 10 tricks|pg||
nt|barnets: not sure he can do it now|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Back to the diamonds!|pg||
nt|henryb:  Surprised West has not yet bid clubs|pg||
nt|bjacobs: :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, it shows the singleton 10 after 2 minutes of hesitation. 2 mins and 10 secs with the singleton 9|pg||
nt|jillan:  while we were sleepig here Fallenius managed to make 2@D 9 tricks in the open so Sweden gained 2 imps|pg||
nt|henryb:  but note that the stiff 10has to be rebid before a stiff 2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That goes without saying|pg||
nt|jillan:  The Swedes are using zz's while the kibs are zzzzzzz,ing  (from a spec)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: What does zz even stand for?|pg||
nt|henryb:  Kidding aside, West has (probably) shown 6-5-1-1 at this point|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Which means that the players are only half asleep I suppose|pg||
nt|milton_se: not only kibs -- but I make cofffee when I see it starting|pg||
nt|jillan:  Now the open room is ahaead of us. They bid 6@H in 4 rounds...|pg||
nt|henryb:  Ah those efficient natural systems |pg||
nt|Walddk2: I remember from a Yeh Bros Cup match in 2008 when it took Dano De Falco 19 minutes and 47 seconds to bid after he got doubled in 3NT. He was still in the tank when I had walked my ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: turtle|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I wonder how it can be that Muller - de Wijs always bid so fast, is Tarzan an easier strong @C system?|pg||
nt|henryb:  you walk it a km every morning?|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 4@H-1 is the match score|pg||
nt|andyv:  it looks like NS agreed to -1|pg||
nt|yuval10: could've made it before that , double-dummy|pg||
pc|hA|nt|vasmar: now diamond lost|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: There's actually a VG theatre here, but it's well isolated from the playing area :)|pg||
nt|stc: yes, but Multilandy better, because selfdescribing|pg||
nt|lesniak: fajnie zaczyna bal- prowokuje do grania w atu|pg||
nt|petergill: as long as you are not the sort of people who forget your system |pg||
pc|h2|nt|Walddk2: But as I understand it, N and E don't agree as to whether @S9 had been played or not. Anyway, that's why we have TDs; it's for them to sort out|pg||
nt|bagman: bad minors and bad shape|pg||
nt|antoniz: karo proszê,a widzisz wiara czyni cuda:)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Dbl by lauria at 2@s is a raise in @D in decent hand|pg||
nt|bagman: North did not support so surprise attac might work. And now it does|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer has 9 tricks, though|pg||
nt|paulg:  with the marked heart finesse|pg||

nt|iain sime: The so- called Aiberdeen double. 3 cards in each take out suit :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: on a normal A@H lead how do you make 4@s?|pg||
nt|stc: only 7 VP behing the 9th place(Norway)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: Lebensohl|pg||
nt|Gerben42: surely will be denied|pg||
nt|gulyas: its hard to see N leading a @D against game|pg||
nt|fabsayc: wow, 2s is overstrength|pg||
nt|skorchev: it's makeable on any lead|pg||
nt|bogier: 1@D= piki|pg||
nt|koksoy: one  is  for  NS  one  is  for  EW|pg||
nt|bagman: NS can also make 10 tricks in NT|pg||
nt|koksoy: sure..|pg||
nt|bagman: S not happy to bid now|pg||
nt|athene: that really does look like a 2@S bid to me|pg||
nt|jillan:  NS has a cheap save in 5@C here|pg||
nt|jillan:  maybe....|pg||
nt|henryb:  and a very tricky defense to 5@s|pg||
nt|jillan:  may not be that easy to bid 5@S over 5@C when you know it is a crazy distribution|pg||
nt|tokay1975: he judges  his hand minus tricks to pd|pg||
nt|yuval10: Italy-Poland 16:14|pg||
mb|2S|nt|hedyg: 3@D?|pg||
nt|hedyg: why?|pg||
nt|Gerben42: probably 3NT|pg||
nt|toral5: 1@S?|pg||
nt|tokay1975: to pds defensive values|pg||
mb|p|nt|antoniz: takie 1pik to szko³a Krzysia:)|pg||
nt|antoniz: studiowa³em Twoje ksi¹¿ki, bardzo starannie:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  not now|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4@S are possible also without K@H lead, if South don't play @h but @D|pg||
nt|bagman: No heart lead now|pg||
nt|brolucius: Bold double by South.|pg||
nt|hedyg: S led A@H in OR and switched to the A@c!|pg||
nt|brolucius: He is looking for a sacrifice somewhere, but doubles instead of 4NT in case partner prefers to pass.|pg||
nt|stc: another big point !|pg||
nt|brolucius: Presumably North will pass.|pg||
nt|hedyg: trying to find a bid..|pg||
nt|barnets: in 3N defense have to try and stop dec making the 9th trick|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 3@D = 18+ with @D|pg||
nt|barnets: he has 8 toppers with 3 hearts|pg||
nt|Gerben42: Sementa will start liking his hand now|pg||
nt|petergill: North loves to bid, but 3@S seems too pushy, to me|pg||
nt|Gerben42: will be Sementa thinking|pg||
nt|petergill: I wonder if it's N or E who is thinking?|pg||
nt|Gerben42: pass than 3@S isnt the kind of strategy on this hand|pg||
nt|Gerben42: either directly 3@S or forever hold your peace|pg||
nt|jkotor: i mamy silnego trefla po raz pierwszy|pg||
nt|bagman: Opts for his longest suit :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: That is exactly what I am saying.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Impressive by Poland. 91-2 against Latvia!|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 5@S is down on @HA lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: It's funny how in the FR the scores have become much more extreme than they were in Groups A & B|pg||
nt|henryb:  The usual question then is "How did those 2 imps get away?"|pg||
nt|milton_se: y, and remember that Poland were aut of the game when the final round started|pg||
nt|bjacobs: East must be reeling - all this bidding and him with 19 points|pg||
nt|jillan:  They claimed 11 tricks in the open room after the @HA led then a @C to the A, seem swrong unless South did not return a @H|pg||
nt|yuval10: so Italy are leading Poland by 7 VP's and tomorrow they're playing vs Israel who needs a win to secure 3rd place|pg||
mb|4S|nt|othered1: 3N would be easy on @S lead.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but 3Nt is the best spot|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@S Dbl 3@S Dbl All Pass might be the auction at one or two tables|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no surprise that south passed|pg||
nt|skorchev: with @C lead you take with @CA, play @D|pg||
nt|andyv:  makeable and able to bid it are 2 different things|pg||

mb|p|nt|brolucius: North only worth false preference to 2@H.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it's important to get yur prefixes and suffixes in the right place  |pg||
nt|andy_h: 3NT is a space consuming bid, so it probably shows 6+@S 14+ and a shortage in hearts (?)|pg||
nt|snetram:  szlemik w karo nie jest Åatwy do licytacji|pg||
nt|antoniz: po tym 1pik chyba niemo¿liwe|pg||
nt|Gerben42: asking for stopper, Duboin has some|pg||
nt|bagman: And now raise to 5@C|pg||
nt|rv: 3@s does make if declarer runs @CJ or play low @c to @c9|pg||
nt|psridhar: 4s no prayer :)|pg||
nt|cumino: Or Ruff @H and play A@D and @D|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: zyczliwi potwierdzaj¹ ¿e bêdzie to mecz z Islandi¹|pg||
nt|sharkey: cud Italians reach 3 NT previous hand - wouldn't surprise me|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphznk: 10/19 leads so far were @C leads, that's funny|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well, she gets access to dummy's clubs, but not too clear what to throw on them|pg||
nt|paulg:  what would an undisciplined player call?|pg||
nt|babs59: this has chances because North will lead a spade|pg||
nt|andyv:  and N will get off to wron glead|pg||
nt|andyv:  wrong lead|pg||
nt|rv: yes agree elimination ensures no @c guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: This will make, too.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: think North should have bid 3@h on the last one, though|pg||
nt|petergill: Gerben's words are Very Important Advice|pg||
nt|petergill: the "or forever hold your peace" bit, I mean|pg||
nt|barnets: needs very good defense to beat this contract|pg||
nt|petergill: 3NT is not at all hopeless|pg||
nt|skorchev: then ruff @D and draw trumps ending in dummy on @SK|pg||
nt|snetram:  zÅa czÄÅciÃ³wka pary B-N|pg||
nt|babs59: but too many hearts to ruff - should still go -1 I think|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: TD just announced half time :)|pg||
nt|toral5: a bit too light i suppose|pg||
nt|haans: will they get 8 tricks?|pg||
nt|haans: or less|pg||
pc|c2|nt|bagman: Declearer might go down a lot now unless he cashes out the 7 tops|pg||
nt|sharkey: West opened 1@H canape OR so East was out unless wanted introduce @D suit Vul...|pg||
nt|hedyg: nice double by E|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Bocchi actually bid 5@C in temp|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: *tempo|pg||
nt|yuval10: EW did well to bid game facing interference|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Toral has left playing a TM|pg||
nt|yuval10: 1NT overcall when you're red and facing a passed hand P must be solid, as E demonstrated here|pg||
nt|lesio: bedzie to wazny mecz Islandia siedzi nam na plecach w tabeli|pg||
nt|othered1: You don't see double made on that hand very often any longer.  Most would just make a simple overcall.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: sure, 5@s makes as @DJ is onside ... but as a general principle, pard should have good values outside|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I suspect South's pass of the double is due to the fact that they play special transfer responses after interference and this is one of the hands that they can't bid directly? ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: (Anyone confirm?)|pg||
nt|yuval10: max. 8 tricks here|pg||
pc|c4|nt|rodvenn: easy to get carried away by the trumps and aces. A heart splinter should slow things down|pg||
nt|andy_h: 4@D sets spades as I think 4@C would be needed to confirm that 2@C was based on a natural club suit|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: XX showing first round control|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I think|pg||
nt|sharkey: S wondering why pd underlead @CA..|pg||
nt|bogier: 1@S= kolory czarne lub czerone|pg||

nt|hedyg: ok ty Bas|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 4@D 1@C 2@H are the easy ones|pg||
nt|barnets: i think 3n would have made|pg||
nt|petergill: 3NT = 3 @H's, 4@D's, one club ... and one on the wash maybe |pg||
nt|Gerben42: hmm :) what about 4@D will they dbl?|pg||
nt|petergill: but EW keep bidding, heading towards contracts which should go down|pg||
nt|antoniz: kto gra w kara wygra zara- pamiêtacie z czasów Juvenii:)|pg||
nt|rv: 2n is 3 card limit raise, South is at best worth a game try in either minor|pg||
nt|rv: good lead by Jennifer|pg||
nt|rv: let declarer struggle for her tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The Danish players can't wait to get out of the room. They all know that they have been thrashed|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You know that although you don't know the score|pg||
nt|peachy: I am sure declarer will take his 8, even nonvul undertricks add up, he know defense cant go that blind to let him score a H|pg||
nt|yuval10: he won't take his 8 if def. will take their 6 first|pg||
nt|yuval10: if W takes A@s and switch to @c|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Walddk2: It does|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: Krzysztof W¹grodzki chyba by³ tym, który rozpropagowa³ to powiedzenie|pg||
nt|babs59: how can North not lead her spade?|pg||
nt|andyv:  should make|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't blame N.. she did what she was supposed to do|pg||
nt|babs59: but won't declarer hope diamonds are 2-1 - @D to K?|pg||
nt|andyv:  but now declarer can play 2 rounds of @ds ending in dummy and run spades|pg||
nt|babs59: throwing 1@C and 1@H|pg||
nt|andyv:  n can ruff in but W will have time to get rid of all her @hs|pg||
nt|babs59: but stuck with 3 hearts to ruff and 2 trumps in dummy?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Anyone for a 2NT bid by E here?|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|brolucius: East can see that playing the jack will not assist his side's prospects.|pg||
nt|brolucius: South was marked with king or queen of clubs, since West would lead an honor from K-Q-x-x(-x).|pg||
nt|daman: 3NT loos like the par contract on this one|pg||
nt|daman: looks*|pg||
nt|daman: 2@C = Gazzilli|pg||
nt|bagman: South has two chances to play hearts before the elimination postion develops|pg||
nt|andyv:  Nunes and Fantoni made a killing at a NABC tourney in the US by playing 5 3N contracts holding 5-4 major suit fits... it was right every time!|pg||
nt|brolucius: At the other table North did make a trump trick, of course, but declarer was able to ditch two hearts on the established @CK-Q.|pg||
nt|petergill: EW have found a way to stay out of 4@S, which should fail (but only just)|pg||
nt|atabey: for this hand everything looks ok. but what if versace had a full opening?|pg||
pc|c8|nt|pasker: safe lead from N|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@s for @d|pg||
nt|iain sime: Italy have turned a handy plus (probably) into minus.|pg||
nt|hedyg: he still had a @d loser and 1@s? how did he make 11 tricks?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Magic.|pg||
nt|hedyg: looks like he should have lost 1@H, 1@s and 1@d|pg||
nt|athene: right|pg||
nt|andyv:  somehow, needing 3-3 @d AND the Ace of @D on side AND trumps not to be 4-0 seems like a huge parlay|pg||
nt|toral5: a kib friend says 1M range starts frm 10-15|pg||
nt|tokay1975: i agree you but he thks when pd bids 5h and get some risk 6h is just 1more trick risk|pg||
pc|cK|nt|Vugraphznk: Lauria had his pass on the tray then took it back, haha. Gotta love screens|pg||
nt|hedyg: he might double to show the value of the 1NT opening|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: "No bid"|pg||
nt|hedyg: depending on agreements|pg||
nt|hedyg: but that was when Bas had written 12-14 |pg||
nt|hedyg: he corrected that|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: lol|pg||
nt|rodvenn: well stopped|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's a very poor slam; too much wasted in hearts|pg||
nt|antoniz: zwyciêstwo bardzo nas cieszy, a zaczê³o sie niespecjalnie:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: lol, S and W just compared hands and decided the result|pg||
nt|koksoy: play  is  easy|pg||
nt|schtsch: @h10 is well positioned|pg||
nt|corplaw: making 3N will put croatia at 24-6 for match; |pg||
nt|barnets: might gain 2 imps 420 on the last|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Kib suggesting 2@C shows a minor and 3@C exactly 5224|pg||
nt|robinswr: this hand would be better at matchpoints|pg||
nt|toral5: yes|pg||
nt|haans: opps can just take their 6 = 2 down|pg||
pc|s5|nt|bagman: N has troubles if they play odd=encouraging on the diamond switch|pg||
nt|petergill: Ew have few losers, but they lack tricks - 5@D on non trump leads might make 2 H's, 1 @C and 8 @D's I guess|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@H is interesting too|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Duboin: "Disgusting"|pg||
nt|babs59: yes - needs to ruff out the @CA too|pg||
nt|andyv:  pretty easy from here|pg||
nt|drorp: double looks classic|pg||
nt|sharkey: has to locate @SJ I think|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|daman: 2@S = 19-21|pg||
nt|toral5: he can set up a @S endplay here by ducking 1st @D|pg||
nt|robinswr: i'm surprised that after the auction is over, that ns doesn't explain the auction out loud|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Nous n'avons pas vu bcp des <<partscores>> Je ne sais pas le mot Francais|pg||
pc|hA|nt|Gerben42: heh|pg||
nt|cicus: S had a chance to X|pg||
nt|yuval10: T@d from S now?|pg||
nt|sharkey: to make|pg||
nt|peachy: defense can take six, I was popinted out, but hardly likely|pg||
pc|h8|nt|daman: 3NT = 5@S  4@C and not 3 @Hs|pg||
nt|iain sime: Bro Paolo would have made 12 ? :)|pg||
nt|bagman: without the trump lead declarer ruffs 2 spades and loses a trump trick in the process|pg||
nt|yuval10: very nice|pg||
nt|yuval10: declarer has to make some decisions now|pg||
nt|yuval10: J@d would be good if N has KQ @D|pg||
nt|yuval10: he can play J and duck, but yet again, he'll have to guess to play Ace in the 2nd round|pg||
nt|yuval10: not easy at all!|pg||
nt|mdgraham: CC says: When the opponents dbl our 1m opening we play transfers from re-double|pg||
pc|h5|nt|bridge_one: and @c|pg||
nt|Gerben42: what can he do|pg||
nt|barnets: if he can make 5@H tricks 4@D and a club |pg||
nt|barnets: seems a lot|pg||
nt|Gerben42: esp the combination of making 5@H and getting the @D through|pg||
nt|barnets: with the @D 4-1|pg||
nt|barnets: if the diamonds split|pg||
nt|petergill: The play looks complex - I hope the defence do not let Duboin's reaction affect their concentration (i.e. make them assume that the contract is hopeless)|pg||
nt|barnets: would have better chance|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: True|pg||
nt|rnmalik: win the 2nd @D and makes.|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|othered1: On @H lead, don't you get @H pitch on @S?|pg||
nt|rv: essential for West to switch to @d now, wd Jennifer|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: powiedzia³bym, ¿e to my im siedzimy na plecach a raczej idziemy pier w pier|pg||
nt|ritong: contrat partiel|pg||
pc|d7|nt|hedyg: ohhhhh N didnt split his @s honours!|pg||
nt|yuval10: in the CR declarer played @s in the 2nd round and in N it's impossible to challenge declarer with a @d continuation|pg||
pc|dA|nt|bogier: z " O" PC ciê¿ko cos wyci¹gn¹æ w licytacji|pg||
nt|pasker: S will need to play a @H through at some point to avoid N being potentially endplayed|pg||
nt|athene: a trump or club ace would keep them alive, but spade is normal|pg||
nt|barnets: Israel who were down a 23 to germany went on a 32-0 tear over 6 boards all partials to lead by 9|pg||
nt|Walddk2: One could argue that the result does not matter for Denmark as they can't finish among the medals, but that is not quite true. First 6 + the Netherlands qualify for next year's ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bermuda Bowl, and top 10 for the Champions' Cup|pg||
nt|barnets: israel were in second place|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So there is indeed something to play for, other than pride|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Well, they can't|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: The screens are still in effect|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: One side cannot receive information from the other, other than by use of bidding/playing cards|pg||
nt|robinswr: after the auction is over, before the opening lead, I always explain the auction out loud |pg||
pc|d8|nt|daman: this is a Roland slam which just might come home   even with the bad trumps|pg||
nt|bagman: anyhow, this is going to be double digit swing for Italy|pg||
nt|Gerben42: if you can ruff 4@S in dummy and @D 3-2 you would get 6 or 7 @H perhaps|pg||
nt|petergill: I predict 4@h will fail and will take a very very long time to be played|pg||
nt|Gerben42: he will try that I guess|pg||
nt|cicus: dangerous though it may have been|pg||
nt|athene: double of 3@D would have worked very well, yes :)|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|jtr: I rather prefer the 1NT rebid by South What do you think?|pg||
nt|latwy: panie dojecha³y do æwiartki|pg||
nt|athene: 6@D easy enough here - just cash @DAK, crossruff|pg||
nt|toral5: still 10 tricks|pg||
pc|s2|nt|brolucius: He was obviously considering it. No idea, really, which is better.|pg||
nt|jtr: Limits the hand and has nice honour holdings to be led round to|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes.|pg||
nt|brolucius: You have persuaded me.|pg||
nt|jtr: Damn I was hoping to get you into an arguement:)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Discuss it with David Burn if that is what you want...|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: Haha, I see where you're coming from David|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: either way it's a whole bunch more to Italy|pg||
nt|sharkey: Trump return seemed natural|pg||
nt|sharkey: 2nd trick|pg||
nt|brolucius: In case the final deal is very exciting, or over in a few seconds, I will take this opportunity to thank our wonderful VG operator, Bas. Many thanks!|pg||
nt|bagman: Does west believe that the @DK sits in where it is?|pg||
nt|hedyg: was taking a nap :(|pg||
nt|frululu: this isnt a good match to watch for people with weak nerves :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: people with weak nerves shouldnt play bridge at all:)|pg||
nt|schtsch: possible to take 2@s a @h and a diamond before declarer takes his 9|pg||
nt|robinswr: can't hurt us but if there is a bidding misunderstanding allows the opponents to defend correctly|pg||
pc|s7|nt|daman: E shd duck|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: N knows the @Cs are 5-0|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Looking rather worried lol|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: OR playing 6@C as well, I'm being told|pg||
nt|daman: this will probably take some time|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 36 minutes left on the clock|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Plenty o' that|pg||
nt|daman: beaucoup|pg||
nt|athene: the known diamond break is bad news for trying to set up diamonds or trying to crossruff|pg||
nt|athene: versace might be considering whether he can set up spades|pg||
nt|athene: but the problem is, he has the weak trumps, so he doesn't really want to use dummy's trumps for ruffing|pg||
nt|daman: 6@C -2 in the OR|pg||
nt|daman: he will finesse a H first|pg||
nt|andy_h: This will be 11 imps to Italy|pg||
nt|hedyg: probably being upset about the A@c play|pg||
nt|hedyg: why not @s back?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|bagman: Especially after the lead|pg||
nt|brolucius: Thanks as well to my fellow commentators Carl and Pekka. All the excitement came at the start. I ahve never seen so many big swings in a sequence.|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Thanks David, 't has been fun|pg||
nt|bagman: S did not return a @D so T is unlikely singleton|pg||
nt|bagman: OK, easy|pg||
nt|Gerben42: in other news: Germany 1 - England 0|pg||
nt|barnets: sounds ok to me|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Nice|pg||

nt|fabsayc: you have to add in a little plus for the decent 5 card side suit when evaluating north hand|pg||
nt|lesniak: nieprzyjemny wynik dla Polski ale szwedzi zagrali swietnego brydza|pg||
nt|andyv:  West rushed this a bit... by playing K@D and A@d and then @S, if N ruffs, then she is endplayed|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: lol, 2 scorers and the other operator have asked me about the Board 17 score|pg||
nt|drorp: last hand of this match|pg||
nt|april7: finally a slam|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Grand|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Yes, X is better, because you wouldn't want to bypass 2@S as a contract, and it also implicates minors. 2NT should probably be a 1255 or something similar :)|pg||
nt|jkotor: tu chyba W robi³ transfer na kara w PO|pg||
nt|robinswr: he could have been endplayed in spades |pg||
nt|bjacobs: So hats off to the Italians there - particularly Bocchi|pg||
nt|milton_se: as so many times before|pg||
nt|sharkey: last hand coming up|pg||
nt|mdgraham: interesting set of boards|pg||
nt|yuval10: last hand of today|pg||

mb|p|nt|jtr: Hmmm Not really|pg||
nt|brolucius: Could be worse.|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: If the E hand could be my average, I'd sign up|pg||
nt|jtr: They might play it in 1NT just for you David|pg||
nt|hedyg: if S had bid 3@h (splinter) then maybe......|pg||
nt|hedyg: last board of this match now|pg||
nt|mdgraham: last board. It's been pretty unavailing for the Lithuanians, I'm afraid|pg||
nt|paulg:  an excellent performance so far by Scotland|pg||
nt|brolucius: South clearly thought that 3@C was conventional at the other table.|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Isn't the W hand a LV 2@D opener?|pg||
nt|hedyg: we will be back in 72 minutes|pg||
nt|brolucius: He must have thought North held both majors. But you would expect 3@D would be explained as showing hearts.|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes it is he upgraded|pg||
nt|brolucius: There is not space here to explain the full reasoning behind the 7@C bid.|pg||
nt|stc: 7@c in OR was intended as choose between @c and @s but not understood as such|pg||
nt|stc: 6@d was simpler to understand|pg||
nt|hedyg: he could have tried 6 @s...|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Versace possibly thought 3@D was natural too, because of the explanation he got that 3@C were both majors|pg||
nt|brolucius: Bocchi-Madala will expect to handle the North/South cards somewhat better.|pg||
nt|iain sime: Might be a pick up v. 7@H !|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why would you give partner that choice when he already selected spades? By a jump even|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: South and West are screen mates|pg||
nt|petergill: Exactly what Latvia wanted, a few more imps for a nice respectable result about mighty Italy|pg||
nt|barnets: for specs interested I have a new website with lots of interesting material - look at some of worlds best ever players and extraordinary bridge taleshttp://www.s...|pg||
nt|barnets: henkinbridge.com/Entertainment/Default.aspx?categoryID=3|pg||
nt|athene: yes, x of 3@D might be t/o of hearts anyway, rather than showing diamonds|pg||
nt|hedyg: special thanks to our specs for joining and for your kind and helpful comments,we hope you enjoyed the show|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Thanks Hedy, it has been a real surprise :)|pg||
nt|athene: although i am not sure that's the best way to play as a passed hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty Bas for a great job as we come to our last board of this set|pg||
nt|petergill: On Bd 19, EW are in 4@S at the other table - will it go down?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: N just said he expects the OR to be in 4@S|pg||
nt|athene: possible 7@S here|pg||
nt|jillan:  At the other table N-S never entered the bidding|pg||
nt|othered1: They've really kept things moving here|pg||
mb|p|nt|antoniz: lol|pg||
nt|paulg:  Last board of the day and Wales will have a tenser day tomorrow after this result|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Final board of an entertaining match.  Hats off to our excellent operator Bas van Beijsterveldt|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: They might get overboard to keep the Italy supporters happy.|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty all for joining us in a most entertaining set of boards... the bridge may not have been perfect but there was a lot of excitement.|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I'm with you on that one Andy|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty Bas for great job|pg||
nt|rodvenn: Norway has bid 2 slams on questionable values. |pg||
nt|brolucius: Not a very good game. Let's see if the Italians can stop low.|pg||
nt|bagman: 4@H is quite awful contract; can EW stay out of it?|pg||
nt|antoniz: a 4pik|pg||
nt|vasmar: maybe Italy doesn't get 25Vps|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thanks to Bas, great job as usual!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And to all our excellent commentators|pg||
nt|stc: perhaps was not sure about 4@s, natural or short ?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Mossop alerted 3@D but then took it back|pg||
nt|petergill: Latvia is still well placed to qualify, having already played Iceland, Italy, Germany and Bulgaria|pg||
nt|gluckenval: url splitted :(|pg||
nt|hedyg: we will be back tomorrow at 9 30 local time |pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: And thank you for being here today, sharing your comments with us :)|pg||
nt|petergill: I may have sent a few kibitzers to the other table with my comment|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@S 5-11 weak two|pg||
nt|corplaw: sorry; 41 imps is worth 23 VPs, needs 1 more|pg||
nt|rv: last deal here, thanks to my fellow commentators Gary, Paolo and Roland and excellent Vu graph operator Bas|pg||
nt|cumino: Ty|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Thanks Venky :) And thank you for your wit and wisdom here :)|pg||
nt|april7: especially in NT|pg||
nt|drorp: i hardly see slam making, only because hearts are 3-3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I was referring to the hotel in Stockholm|pg||

nt|m_niemi: sry, priv|pg||
nt|mdgraham: If we knew what that meant, we'd probably agree |pg||
nt|brolucius: If 3@H was NF at the other table, East might well have passed.|pg||

nt|andyv:  ty to Bas for a wonderful job and to all the commentators and specs who kept us on our toes.  And thank you Roland for making this possible.|pg||
nt|gulyas: an entertaining match, Hungary showing that they are still in there, trying to Q for the 2nd week|pg||
nt|athene: interesting that versace didn't open 2@H in the other room|pg||
nt|fabsayc: not saying they needed to be there, just that north hand has a lot of potential cover cards|pg||
nt|andyv:  but here it didn't matter...N had to find a @c lead.. not easy...S might have risked a dble of 6@d asking for pd not to lead a spade.|pg||
nt|rv: big thanks to all specs for their feedback and listening to us patiently|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Hahahaha Roland|pg||
nt|atabey: terrible slam. and unreachable also I believe|pg||

nt|bjacobs: Yes, sure, partnership bidding is the key to being successful at bridge :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: How did I go?|pg||
nt|bagman: They are vulnerable so they might bid it|pg||
nt|brolucius: Many thanks to Bas for the extra table-side information. (The mark of a top VG operator...)|pg||
nt|petergill: Can they reach 4@H?|pg||
nt|gulyas: 2@H not as good as 2@S|pg||
nt|hedyg: too strong for 2@H not enough for 1@H|pg||
nt|gulyas: N just had the hand to reopen 2@H tho|pg||
nt|gulyas: now they are in 2@S as well|pg||
nt|skorchev: another makeable 4M :)|pg||

nt|april7: why impossible, if E supports at the end W's @C suit,then W will bid 6 ofcourse|pg||
nt|jillan:  great job Bas|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And many thanks to our entertaining commentators: Jill Mellstrom, Bertil Johnson, Roland Wald and Henry Bethe. |pg||
nt|bjacobs: Sweden played well, but not quite well enough, I guess|pg||
mb|3N|nt|paulg:  Scotland have played well in the first two days of the tournament and hopefully that will set them up for the tough days ahead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Last board of the match now|pg||
nt|andy_h: Transfer responses after an interference of an opening bid, hence 1@H=5+@S|pg||
nt|rodvenn: but a very entertaining fight!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thanks Bas, Vladimir, Andy, Jon, Christian and Martin|pg||
nt|paulg:  i think we've all lost the clubs|pg||
nt|yuval10: will be very interesting matches until the end of this championship|pg||
nt|rnmalik: No doubt:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: May not be so easy to keep low when the heart fit is found.|pg||
nt|jtr: I suppose West might cue now|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: lol, wb|pg||
nt|andyv:  1600 viewers here... thanks to all the specs for joining us and helping us with their comments and questions|pg||
nt|bagman: Easy bidding followed by easy play, I guess|pg||
nt|hedyg: we will be back tomorrow morning at 9 30 local time|pg||
nt|andy_h: And an interesting rebid from Bocchi|pg||
nt|bagman: East migh value his KJ a bit too much|pg||
nt|stc: W opened 2NT, you have 5@ss, hard to believe that partner has 5+@s and no @c fit !!|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I am not sure whether Zivkovic alerted 3@D, I would assume so|pg||
nt|cumino: 2@S seems makeable|pg||
nt|haans: seniors 9.30 12.15 15.15 Paris time Open 12.15|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: thanks to Bill Frisby and Tezcan Sen for their analysis|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Be advised: we're starting one hour earlier tomorrow, 9:30 AM local time and 8:30 AM London|pg||
nt|tez: ty all:)|pg||
nt|jkotor: 3@h x -1?|pg||
nt|petergill: A very easy 620 to finish|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: One of the few times where the CR has more kibs than the OR. Must be the excellent commentary :)|pg||
nt|rv: some play 1n from South as sandwitch nt showing other 2 suits|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: Having already shown a minimum|pg||
nt|bagman: @SA @HAK club |pg||
nt|bjacobs: Can he end in a blaze of glory?  The bidding is very informative|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It seems hard to believe that GIB thinks 4@S can make, but there it is|pg||
nt|jbgood: another good result for Italy coming in now - 3 NT in the other room was "a bit" high..|pg||
nt|bagman: Not exactly the friendiest of layouts for W|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the open of 1@D would work better here|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: "Lauria has left the table"|pg||
nt|Gerben42: if they pinpoint the @S problem...|pg||
nt|petergill: 2NT forcing|pg||
nt|gulyas: 3@C makes|pg||
nt|skorchev: oopsy, I didn't saw the pass of 1@S by South, sry|pg||
nt|jkotor: bo kontra na 3@c chyba ze wzglêdu na opozycjê kierow¹|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: S and W predicting the auction now :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Saying N will bid 3@D - X - 3@H - p - p - X - ap|pg||
nt|bogier: oj, Bale juz ich chyba nie wypuszcz¹|pg||
nt|jkotor: S i W próbuj¹ przewidzieæ licytacjê|pg||
nt|andyv:  the Italian team has played very well... the Irish tead did have some chances|pg||
nt|mdgraham: looks like just three losers |pg||
nt|petergill: 4@SX would be 500 I think|pg||
nt|lechcold: bêdzie strata, ale jest zapasik:)|pg||
nt|milton_se: seems an appropriate analysis|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Bocchi: "Stiff?" Madala: "Yes, of course!"|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Finally, our appreciation to the European Bridge League (J-C Beineix), Belgian Bridge Federation, and on behalf of BBO, Guy Lambeaux|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's certainly been a smorgasbord of great bridge, these last two weeks|pg||
nt|othered1: Play in @H could be pretty interesting, but north treated his 7-4 as a 1-suiter, a normal tactic|pg||
nt|8252: dans 4 plutot, |pg||
pc|d4|nt|brolucius: 4@D a cue-bid with heart agreed.|pg||
nt|bagman: Normally they would be nice but facing this bad suit they are not that useful|pg||
nt|brolucius: Not easy to stop low because there are so many hands to be covered by relatively few sequences and it is not possible to discover that much about each hand.|pg||
nt|bagman: Getting plus here is worth 8 IMPs|pg||
nt|bagman: Going one down is worth 3|pg||
nt|brolucius: East must at least be thinking about passing 3@H.|pg||
nt|hedyg: Mossop might wake up now to the transfer?|pg||
nt|hedyg: no|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: But Mossop didn't wholeheartedly|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Please stick around as I will show the missed board 16|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok we will!|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Mossop explaining now that 3@D was undiscussed|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So the 1700 will not be that costly; this is only a question of an overtrick or not|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6 or 7 IMPs|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Mossop saying he took 3@D as constructive with @D|pg||
nt|iain sime: Italy have missed the save , but will still pick up 7 imps or so.|pg||
nt|hedyg: you dont expect opps to overcall 2NT thus dont discuss your bids in case they do?|pg||
nt|stc: 6@s probably -800|pg||
nt|hedyg: push opps into making grand?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 6 or 7 IMPs won't matter for the VP score: 21:9|pg||
nt|athene: now 4nt|pg||
pc|d3|nt|brolucius: East still sees at least two holes unless partner can bid again. Well bid.|pg||
nt|jtr: East has too many hooles to be interested even if the @d cue was the Ace|pg||
nt|jtr: holes|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, they bid it well. (Famous last words as West raises to 6@H...)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And West has done enough too with his aceless hand|pg||
nt|jtr: lol|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He already encouraged with 4@D|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, but he does have five trumps, which makes the singleton spade a little more attractive than it would otherwise have been.|pg||
nt|brgpro: what is W thinking about?|pg||
nt|jtr: Bidding a 'Roland' slam|pg||
nt|brolucius: Maybe what he should bid next.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If East can't take an initiative over 4@D, West can't bid on in my opinion|pg||
nt|hedyg: we will be back in 75 minutes|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Thanks Hedy, fellow commentators and kibs! I can only hope you liked it as much as me :)|pg||
nt|bagman: Fast 11 tricks|pg||
nt|stc: then 7@s for -1100|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I was going to say, this type of 1NT overcall is rather rare where I come from :)|pg||
nt|athene: ok i thought they play 4nt shows even number of keycards|pg||
nt|athene: their card says they play modified turbo when clubs are trumps|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Was 4@D a cuebid for @C or was 4@C a cuebid for @D?|pg||
nt|athene: for anyone who hasn't met that, the idea is, you bid 4nt with an even number of keycards |pg||
nt|athene: since 4nt as rkcb isn't much use when clubs are trumps|pg||
nt|atabey: and what is 4@s|pg||
nt|athene: that would be good defence against 6@C, if hearts not 3-3 - don't try to cash the second spade, but switch to a diamond, to kill the entry to dummy|pg||
pc|dA|nt|atabey: TY Hedy my colleges and spectators|pg||
nt|brolucius: bravo!|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but in italian system 1@D means 4+cards unbalanced|pg||
nt|andyv:  something wrong with a system that misses the 5-4 fit for the 5-2|pg||
nt|bagman: 2@C artificial, I guess|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thanks Bas for great operating as usual|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thanks all, next round in about 75 minutes|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Cheers|pg||

nt|andy_h: either 1NT is 12-16 or Bocchi "downgraded" to 12-14 based on his singleton spade. Triple-four-one hands are always hard to bid|pg||
nt|cicus: 2NT doesn't|pg||
nt|andyv:  N did think about it.  S did bid 2@s on his own so he is pretty sure S has 4 @s and nothing else.|pg||
nt|skorchev: looks like North is short of entries to take all finesses|pg||
nt|koksoy: bye..|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: J'ai entendu "partscore", "score partiel(le)", "contrat partiel(le)" et "manche partiel(le)" lol|pg||
nt|ritong: manche partiel, c etait surement une fine plaisanterie|pg||
nt|8252: manche partielle c'est quand on la chute|pg||
pc|c3|nt|jtr: But 6 is rather too good for him|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and he realised that eventually|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thanks all, back in 1 hour and a wee bit|pg||
nt|Gerben42: impressive|pg||
nt|petergill: They pinpointed the spade problem, as one expects from these Italians|pg||
nt|gulyas: 2NT may not|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: cos odrobimy|pg||
nt|corplaw: declarer can make this with good reads|pg||
nt|schtsch: @cK and a @s for discard|pg||
nt|rv: here 1n shows 16-18 and nice safe contract of 2@s reached|pg||
nt|haans: Bye all its been fun :)|pg||
nt|peachy: on second thought (thx kib) , if declarer had club ace, it was cold, so perhaps SA and switch to clubs was much better than I first thought!|pg||
pc|c6|nt|Gerben42: playing like this they are among the big favorites|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Another 4@H by EW in a 7 card fit :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: surely 2NT was not natural|pg||
nt|athene: 2nt is a bad spot, as usual|pg||
nt|jkotor: pik do skrótu?|pg||
nt|bogier: :)|pg||
nt|antoniz: dziêki, do us³yszenia:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: My pleasure, thanks all for showing up and providing me with a job :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And to my fellow commentators, Barnet, Bill and Vladimir|pg||
pc|c7|nt|mdgraham: that's not the best possible start...|pg||
nt|iain sime: thanks Bas and all. Bye. |pg||
nt|hedyg: 64 minutes :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Thanks Iain|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|snetram:  Moim zdaniem E powinien walczyc - 4NT|pg||
nt|bogier: Polki przegra³y Francuzkom 5 pik X w tym rozdaniu|pg||
nt|andyv:  in Belgium|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: England - Ukraine have only compared 4 boards!|pg||
pc|h9|nt|brolucius: Good entertainment today - an excellent set of boards.|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes lots of fun :(|pg||
nt|barnets: http://www.shenkinbridge.com/    some asked me to repeat|pg||
nt|Gerben42: again from Duboin|pg||
nt|athene: i don't know how NS play it but most experts treat all these 2nt bids as artificial, usually showing two places to play|pg||
nt|cicus: without @Cs N has only 6 tricks|pg||
nt|jkotor: gib mówi, ¿e to chodzi|pg||
nt|bogier: pozory myl¹|pg||
nt|barnets: tx all specs |pg||
nt|sharkey: Bocchi determined to play in his strong 7 card suit in this "swan neck" (74) hand|pg||
pc|h7|nt|antoniz: czemu nie przez kiery?|pg||
nt|gulyas: this going down 2|pg||
nt|rv: Italians ladies should century of last ball (sry deal):)|pg||
nt|yuval10: W needs a good @h guess now|pg||
nt|athene: he won't risk the lead being a singleton|pg||
pc|hK|nt|daman: running scores Group A    http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/runningscores/asp/roundteamsconditstatclassicmod.asp?qtournid=819&qshowflag=1|pg||
nt|pasker: maybe versace could have chosen to play in @Ds instead|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty Bas for your wonderful work and ty Barbara, it's been a pleasure.  And a big thanks to all the specs who make this a most enjoyable way to spend a couple of hours.|pg||
nt|athene: interesting lead from sementa - he didn't know south had that heart suit did he?|pg||
nt|sharkey: sry Ed|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|snetram:  5 trefli - praktycznie bez jednej|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Duboin probably had his reasons to pass|pg||
pc|s6|nt|andy_h: In the Open Room, the Norwegian N/S pair had an uncontested auction to 3NT after North decided to reverse with 2@H|pg||
nt|sharkey: may make if guess @H|pg||
nt|skorchev: maybe some problem with Bridgemate?|pg||
nt|schtsch: just made|pg||
nt|corplaw: croatia on way to a blitz|pg||
nt|schtsch: @c goes on @s|pg||
nt|yuval10: and he did|pg||
nt|yuval10: so 2@d , @c and @h to lose|pg||
nt|yuval10: 1 imp for NET. but +17 to Iceland in the end|pg||
pc|s5|nt|Vugraphznk: Thank you all, be back later, good night Andy :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty Bas|pg||
nt|andyv:  good night all|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 70-68 isner|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|bagman: Well guessed|pg||
nt|bagman: Now he makes for 8 IMPs|pg||
nt|andyv:  not sure how he could do it|pg||
nt|petergill: Thanks to Matthias Berghaus and Mike Graham for their comments and to Bas for being one of the best operators around|pg||
nt|mdgraham: second that|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Thanks Peter, and thank you for your sharing of your wit with us despite the late hour :)|pg||
nt|petergill: Anyone know why Versace doubled 3@S instead of simply bidding 4@H?|pg||
nt|ziff:  And to Peter and all the kibitzers, who keep us busy and make it fun|pg||
nt|mdgraham: possibly to show two places to play |pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|robinswr: 1diam pass 1nt shows clubs, so i'm surpised about the club lead|pg||
pc|d6|nt|petergill: He was a passed hand - perhaps he was showing a maximum 4@H bid in case slam was on?|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: 19-11 then|pg||
nt|8252: le 690 si upmark deraille à @s|pg||
pc|d2|nt|jtr: A close well-fought match|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes they are not doubled yet|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Thanks all, bye for now.|pg||
nt|sharkey: ty all|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Thanks all!|pg||
nt|othered1: Thanks everyone and bye for now.|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jkotor: ale ju¿ -1|pg||
nt|athene: i guess it was likely that south had the @HA so sementa wanted to put immediate pressure on|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|hedyg: OMG!|pg||
nt|hedyg: will they ever stop?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: its over|pg||
nt|gulyas: he was not sure they have a @C fit?|pg||
nt|bagman: The trump lead is helpful. Declarer draws trumps and sets up the clubs|pg||
nt|mdgraham: although holding five hearts 4@H is likely to be as good a spot as any - also, East might be enormous and EW may have a slam |pg||
nt|ziff:  They always keep slam in the picture....|pg||
nt|mdgraham: thanks all.|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I think he wouldnt mind if partner passes with say 2344|pg||
nt|petergill: Thanks to EBL and to anyone in Ostend Belgium who made this broadcast possible|pg||
nt|ziff:  Thanks all, one more round to go in the qualification|pg||
nt|petergill: Results at http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/10Ostend/Results.htm|pg||
nt|rv: I like Sandwitch NT here though it doesn't work out on this deal, if you play natural my preference is min of good 16-18 for this bid|pg||
nt|athene: thanks all|pg||
nt|barnets: bye all|pg||
nt|xenya: thanks everyone|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Thank you, we'll be back in rougly 45 minutes )|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bye|pg||
nt|peachy: Last hand. Thank you Bas for a great job as operator. Thanks Yuval and  Haans. Thanks kibitzers for your comments, always appreciated.|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ryskiel_: Panie niestety poleg³y z frnacuskimi Madame narazie jest minus 20|pg||
nt|jkotor: chodzi o to, ¿eby N nie przebil 2 pików|pg||
nt|jkotor: a Cezary dok³ada do wszystkich trefli|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: But that's an important IMP|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Thank you Raija, for your wit and wisdom this session :)|pg||
pc|d9|nt|jkotor: brawo Adam!|pg||
pc|d8|nt|sybarra: still cant handle it all |pg||
nt|bagman: Now declarer can get two diamonds the tricks he makes from trumps|pg||
nt|pasker: it is difficult to know when you don't know what 2m would have been over 1NT|pg||
nt|bagman: In the end N might get endplayed but the contact is probably down at that time|pg||
nt|atabey: anyways. its a dream to reach 6@c on this deal|pg||
nt|april7: but W thought a long time before he passed|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|daman: ciao all|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Thanks, be back tomorrow|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: The TD's here now|pg||
nt|antoniz: a my 11 lew|pg||
nt|hedyg: -2 either way|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well these were 20 simple boards, the play here was not fast to the point of creating errors|pg||
nt|andyv:  http://tinyrul.com/ebc-open-b    http://tinyurl.com/ebc-open-a|pg||
nt|atabey: england and polish bid this slam. ty specs|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Thanks all, we'll be back in a little over 30 minutes|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: (Iceland - Netherlands)|pg||
nt|athene: thanks all :)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|brolucius: It was worth a think, since partner had forced to game opposite a blizzard. Slam would have been OK if the @DK was the @DA, but West could see which honor he had (on close ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: inspection).|pg||
nt|andyv:  When E denied @hs, maybe he shoudl have pulled 1N to 2@d|pg||
nt|andersk: wd|pg||
nt|schtsch: 25|pg||
pc|sT|nt|jtr: I had to get a hyphen in during the session just to please DB|pg||
nt|brolucius: I didn't notice it. Where?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thanks Bas|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thanks everyone|pg||
nt|jtr: close-fought|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Back in 75 minutes|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, Bas was great. Many thanks!|pg||
nt|jtr: Thanks for watching everyone  TTFN|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: Thank you, be back later :)|pg||
nt|toral5: dutch are likely to gain on brd 17 whr italy played 4@H.so looks like holland cant lose this match|pg||
nt|toral5: tht was the last brd.tnk u all|pg||
nt|toral5: see you 2morw|pg||
nt|toral5: bye|pg||
nt|robinswr: seems like the 10 of diamonds would be a better lead, hoping partner has five diamnods|pg||
pc|s2|nt|sharkey: and a tie score 2nd half|pg||
nt|brolucius: A classy plus score by the Italians to end the session. |pg||
nt|bagman: It's seldom that at this level a pair stops in 3@H in an invitational sequence when vulnerable|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Sementa played the "played card game" again|pg||
nt|sharkey: I understand Bas and the Dutch play Slovakia next game in football - so good luck to both teams :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@D by Versace seam more effective after 1nt by Lauria|pg||
nt|pasker: W likely to make 3 more trump tricks|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty all, bye|pg||
nt|athene: thanks all|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 20-10 to Hungary, thank you all|pg||

nt|babs59: and we all hope you get some sleep now Andy!|pg||
nt|babs59: thanks everyone|pg||
nt|peachy: And finally, thanks to BBF for organizing this great show, and to BBO for providing the place for it for everyone to enjoy!|pg||
pc|s3|nt|bagman: A game should be bid  if its 33% or better|pg||
nt|skorchev: they used about 100 minutes for 20 boards - 5 mins/board|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: They're entitled to 8.5 lol|pg||
nt|andyv:  zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz|pg||
