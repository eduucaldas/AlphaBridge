nt|gluckenval: solo 50 in 2 turni ? Potevano anche sforzarsi un po di più... :)|pg||
nt|figb_rama: già sì, sono andati un pò sotto media|pg||
nt|figb_rama: la nostra nazionale femminile sta lottando contro tutto e tutti per raggiungere il 6° posto|pg||
nt|figb_rama: utile per qualificarsi per i mondiali|pg||
nt|gluckenval: abbiamo gli Hackett qui.... bello|pg||
nt|gluckenval: Justin & Jason Hackett sono una vecchia conoscenza dei nostri, giocano un sistema di base naturale con nobili anche 4i e anche in corto lungo con mano debole (1@C min. 3 carte), ...|pg||
nt|gluckenval: 1NT 14-16 nelle prime 2 posizioni e 15-17 in 3a e 4a, 2@C forte, 2@D@H@S deboli |pg||
nt|gluckenval: In controgioco segnali std, ovvero la cicciotta incoraggia, con conto dritto. In GB e USA si adotta ancora spesso il chiamare con le grosse.|pg||

nt|star6ija: 17-18 direct 1 N, 19-20 via 1h|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: well they scaped from that one |pg||
nt|ralfwil: the only positive for ns is that it´s undoubled|pg||
nt|oleberg: 3 down could be possible, but requires accurate defence|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: all the key cards are badly placed K@H,K@S,AQ@C|pg||
pc|dT|nt|peachy: EW system is 4-card majors, light style 14-16 and 15-17NT. NS is Transfer Walsh 15-17NT|pg||
nt|athene: tricky hand to play - ruffing diamond finesse is a possibility|pg||
nt|bagman: There are lot's of high cards out and E passed and W opened weak|pg||
nt|athene: the problem is that ruffing diamond finesse might not be that useful, even if the king is with east|pg||
nt|athene: because if the @DQ is covered you have to use the @CA to get back there for a fast pitch of the heart|pg||
nt|athene: and that gives up on a double club finesse|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer wants a quick discards and wants to play the clubs for one loser|pg||
nt|athene: it's possible he might put all his eggs in one basket and take a normal diamond finesse; i.e. lead to the queen|pg||
nt|bagman: W  has shown up with @HKQ, does he have @DK and @CH?|pg||
nt|athene: the other issue is, you aren't necessarily going all-out to make|pg||
nt|athene: if it risks incurring two or three additional vulnerable undertricks|pg||
nt|bagman: S vulnerable he needs to make as many tricks as possible unless he has 9 safe|pg||
nt|bagman: He has likely 3 spade losers and a club|pg||
nt|athene: not at all an easy decision for south here|pg||
nt|athene: i prefer to open these hands 2@S first time|pg||
nt|athene: passing might appear safer but you often end up having to take more of a risk later at a higher level|pg||
nt|bagman: If he takes the straight diamond finesse, he needs to play @S to the Q|pg||
nt|athene: he knows the points are split fairly evenly between east and west|pg||
nt|bagman: Hoping for Jx KQxxx Kxx Qx or similar leaving E AKx xx xxx Kxx|pg||
nt|athene: west has weak-2 and east can't open - that doesn't leave much room for variation, with 21 hcp missing|pg||
nt|athene: the only problem is, there are a lot of variations in which cards each defender has|pg||
nt|bagman: If he places KQ of hearts and @DK west, he is quite restricted to place the rest for a make|pg||
nt|andreasw:  only lead is @S if u dont want to give any trick's|pg||
nt|haans: South do not liked it|pg||
nt|othered1: hi!|pg||

nt|ziff:  Looks like the par contract|pg||
nt|yuval10: so no swing in a rather dangerous board |pg||
nt|yuval10: Israeli open for instance opened 1@c and played it wrong-sidedly, going down 1|pg||
nt|aldek: it can be made, but unlikely|pg||
nt|cameron_1: yes|pg||
nt|mdgraham: looking at the banner, you can be dead certain|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the W is a clue|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|roswolf: another thinnish game reached|pg||

nt|poohbear: sorry|pg||
nt|poohbear: dont mean to chat|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: hi barry|pg||
nt|udo: 4 @H fails , even finding @H Queen doubleton is not enough|pg||
nt|udo: no entries for the 2 top-spades for diamond discards|pg||

nt|xenya: but it's odds in to play for the actual spade disitribution|pg||
nt|xenya: odds on *|pg||
nt|aap00: no squeeze chances, so N has to guess - play on @dJ onside or @hK remaining bare|pg||

nt|aap00: y |pg||
nt|tomi2:  2004 yes, 2008 not|pg||

mb|1S|nt|Gerben42: and whats important you will keep your VP score against the 8 teams that join you in the final!|pg||

nt|ziff:  Hi Tomi|pg||
nt|chick: yes, jivko, but @DA and small trump still doesn't hurt in that case|pg||
nt|lesh: if the small @s wins, then you have a problem|pg||
nt|andersk: over 3rd and 4th hand openings EW play a drury|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: double swing board one and 1st blood austria|pg||
nt|justin c: this double not to everybody's taste|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: no move after openning |pg||
nt|oleberg: EW plays 2@S as a strong-weak 2@S, while 2@D would be a weak-weak 2@S (or@H)|pg||
mb|3H|nt|motu: 2@D is 15-19 with any onesuiter or 20-21 NT|pg||

nt|motu: 2@S is 9+ any hand|pg||
nt|andersk: Sorry Im late, was dinner here:)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: however there's transportation problem|pg||
nt|bagman: With spades 2-2 declarer can set up the hearts before losing 3 club tricks to make 10 tricks in spades|pg||

nt|yuval10: can they reach 5@c here?|pg||

nt|ady: kib has asked for the link for the running score|pg||

mb|4H|nt|haans: 1@D normal trf|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 10 tricks in diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: no its played with 18 teams, you dont replay the teams in your group|pg||
nt|star6ija: some prospects for making|pg||
nt|cameron_1: David has a much harder time in his 5@d |pg||

nt|haans: normal today|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 1@D meaning  4 card @H|pg||

nt|odysseus69: 5D coming?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|lmeili: if @c lead & guss wrong of @s|pg||

nt|antoniz: farcik jest:)|pg||
nt|lechcold: mniam:)|pg||
nt|snetram:  zabawne|pg||
nt|mdgraham: NS strong club, variable NT; EW 5M, weak NT, 1@C may be weak NT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: first blood to Sweden on board 1 - the Swedish EW made 6@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|andersk: I beleve 2 @C is drury with 3 card|pg||
nt|aap00: no cards for 6 |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 2@S shape & points |pg||
nt|justin c: as a passed hand, West might have stretched to 2@D |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: first duck from declarer to open comunication |pg||
nt|oleberg: Declarer will probaly try to "scramble"; getting his small thrumphs home|pg||
mb|p|nt|eweber: and of those 10 teams 6+NL will play in the Bermuda Bowl|pg||
nt|andersk: Has to switch @D or @C noe, I predeict @D|pg||
nt|ady: this needed a major suit lead |pg||
nt|kdr_fm: nothing breaking (well @C 5/4) this is going off a few|pg||
nt|oleberg: Instead of trying to drawthrumphs, and control the hand|pg||
nt|odysseus69: no|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|bagman: quiet lookin partial, declarer probably making 9 tricks|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 3@H  6 card |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 4@H end |pg||
nt|lesh: unfortunately for E/W 4@s is making|pg||
nt|barnets: 5@D would be a good save down just 1|pg||
nt|brolucius: The doubletons in spades, also the vulnerability, are a deterrent.|pg||
nt|bagman: The defense has 4 tricks but they have not the means to take them (3 clubs and a heart)|pg||
nt|brolucius: The 2-2 spade break will now be helpful to declarer, providing an entry to the long hearts.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Murray lost first set|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer ruffs this, draws two rounds of trumps with QJ and starts hearts|pg||
pc|d2|nt|yuval10: did well here, and in the OR as well|pg||
nt|MolvaM: running scores http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/runningscores/asp/roundteamsconditstatclassicmod.asp?qtournid=819&qshowflag=1|pg||
nt|MolvaM: norths 2@c could be the gazilli convention that several pairs play these days|pg||
nt|MolvaM: showing either a natural @c rebid or some sort of strong hand|pg||
nt|ftpe: hearts 5-2, so only 5 spades here|pg||
nt|aap00: so 4 is reasonable contract|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer has some sort of chance to ditch a diamond on one of the black suits. A diamond finesse and a heart break would then give him a chance.|pg||
nt|brolucius: South's signal on the top-club lead deterred Lauria from cashing his other high club, thereby giving declarer a diamond discard. Buit the @DK is wrong anyway.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Vladimir was in Warsaw Poland in 2006 and in Antalya 2007 with reasonable ranking, however this time surprised to his line|pg||
nt|h_karluk: *Antalya Turkiye|pg||

nt|xenya: yes, 11 tricks|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|eweber: o.k., sorry|pg||
nt|davidb: good stop as 3NT -only 8 tricks|pg||
nt|santyclz: 6 imps to France on board 2 for going + in both rooms.  |pg||
nt|othered1: it's difficult to stay out of this game, unless west opens strong NT and east chooses not to act, vulnerable.|pg||
nt|lesh: should take much longer before claiming|pg||
nt|andersk: Kinda stragne 2 @C and 4@H bid from Charlie here, I would prefeer 4@H over 1 @H opening, isnt that what the hand is wurth?|pg||
nt|lesh: certainly 4@H would do the job. I dont think North would dbl|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this might make, or it might go down - that covers most possibilities |pg||
nt|mdgraham: but should make now, even if NS get a spade ruff, as a diamond can be discarded on @CK|pg||
nt|ralfwil: walter the valrus had made this easy - double with a voice of thunder - (Mollo)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Please no cricket scores on the screen, since I am recording it.|pg||
pc|s6|nt|andersk: agree|pg||
nt|ftpe: he now|pg||
nt|aap00: in brd 2 W(!) pushed to 3nt... |pg||
pc|s2|nt|h_karluk: declarer for sure would try long string|pg||
nt|haans: the more @D he plays the better defense|pg||
nt|h_karluk: we will see |pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|andersk: 990 now|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Will make now. If S tries to get a @s ruff a @d will disapperar on @cK and if NS takes their @d tricks, no communication|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|chick: bypassing drury may have some kind of subtle implication about strength|pg||
pc|sT|nt|Gerben42: changed from last time and will change again next time I guess|pg||
nt|andreasw:  3nt 11 trick's finessing @d|pg||
nt|othered1: i.e, it's a game virtually everyone will get to|pg||
pc|s8|nt|athene: lauria's negative double over 2@D warned south off getting involved with his spade suit|pg||
nt|oleberg: Then again, he might not :)|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: bad news has arrived from the trumps|pg||
nt|oleberg: Nridge is easier, when you can see all four hands|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|aap00: for me strange, with 10hcp and passed pd |pg||
nt|haans: not easy clubs finesse|pg||
pc|h5|nt|lmeili: if S ducks @dA|pg||
nt|bagman: I would guess that declarer discards a club on the hearts and gives 2 spades and 2 hearts|pg||
nt|athene: Sementa is prepared to lose his @HK to hold declarer to one heart winner rather than two|pg||
nt|bagman: Sementa's duck gives defense 3 spades instead of 2 spades|pg||
nt|brolucius: A high spot-card (@C7) is discouraging, against both suit and NT contracts. (Reverse attitude).|pg||
nt|justin c: leaving the @C suit blocked to keep entry to @HQJ|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a @s lead was defeating|pg||
pc|h7|nt|mcarroll: I agree - lets the defence signal very comfortably|pg||
nt|h_karluk: the only possibility to make this a thrown-in play with misdefense of West|pg||
nt|aap00: so, "well deserved" -5 impls|pg||
pc|hK|nt|haans: @H6 even|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|peachy: NS 1H opening might not be everybody's choice, but they play 4-card majors, light style|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: he will ruff a @H & open the clubs guess !|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer keeps the @SA as an entry in case he needs to finesse E for @HT|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|peachy: oops, he overcalled!|pg||
nt|ziff:  I must confess that I would not sell the E hand as 9+, but Entscho s judgement has always been somewhat different....|pg||
nt|h_karluk: pitch the spade and lose the board|pg||
pc|hT|nt|MolvaM: this is a 630 or 660 hand for the field to rest their grey cells|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Thor Erik was in San Remo 2009, i guess evil made him do that double|pg||
pc|h9|nt|andersk: will probably go down|pg||
nt|oleberg: Well, a double with a voice of thunder might not have been good. It might make if nort's strength is known|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|athene: he will carry on with the time-honoured antidote to a 4-4 trump fit - keep leading trumps|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer can play N to have AQx and make now 10 tricks|pg||
pc|h2|nt|peachy: ignore everything I said, please :)|pg||
nt|bagman: Or W can let N to have @SQ|pg||
nt|athene: declarer probably thinks the club is offside|pg||
nt|athene: he will try and endplay north|pg||
nt|athene: duck another spade now, perhaps|pg||
nt|bagman: The @C-finesse working is an extra bonus|pg||
nt|andersk: maybe, I cant see what damage ¤@H direct might couse|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|xenya: i'm told there are no commentators in the open room, so I think i'll switch over there|pg||
nt|ftpe: now he plays safe|pg||
nt|aap00: oh, yes me too |pg||
nt|kdr_fm: W praying that @dT9 .... arghhh :>|pg||
nt|barnets: perhaps the hackets will bid 5@D they like to bid|pg||

nt|jameslee 2: a 7/2/2/2 Nt by East interesting |pg||
nt|haans: Finals words: willwats: could ruff out the q if 2nd,3rd or 4th,  finesse only neccassary if 5-1 or 6-0|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: block 2@D  by S so no transfer by West|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: North looks like a 3@D bid|pg||
nt|udo: nice 4 @H for EW|pg||
nt|lesh: N/S might appear to be in 4@s|pg||
nt|h_karluk: it helps you to know 3 or 4 cards support and to test whether sound or light opening there|pg||

nt|shevek: coffee hand, brb :)|pg||
nt|jkotor: operator, do we know 3@c meaning?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but will S be quiet?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Quite common to play that two of a major via Stayman is invitational now. That restricts the option of bidding 2@C on South's shape.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: some advocate Stayman with 4-4 knowing at least a 4-3 fit - would not have been good idea here|pg||
nt|bagman: South has enough to be dummy in NT; no need to look for an 'escape'|pg||
nt|barnets: does not look north is destined for success here|pg||
pc|s3|nt|eweber: 2@c precision style again|pg||

nt|mamos: and or values   "competitive"|pg||
nt|cameron_1: i was referign to David's initial choice of 2@c rather than X|pg||
nt|mamos: from an english poerspective these Queens all look to be in the wrong places  opponents hands rather than theirs|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: no he stayed still Vul danger|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but use it moderate , 10 goodish or minimum 11 required|pg||

nt|yuval10: in 4@h you can discard 2@s's over the KQ@c|pg||
nt|tomi2:  do you play 1@S as 5 cards here?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: iceland lies at the top of the table with 2 more days to go|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 1 more match today and 6 matches the next days|pg||
nt|MolvaM: top 9 ranked teams will qualify for the second stage|pg||
nt|MolvaM: then teams will play a round robin with the teams coming from the other group|pg||
nt|ftpe: south is looking for 6 spades, but cant win here|pg||
nt|haans: 3@C full of danger|pg||
nt|haans: 2@D may have been trf|pg||
nt|haans: more logical|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: not in this position |pg||
nt|haans: but bidding @D twice is?|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: but one never knows in this game |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: what a parnership can bild up |pg||
nt|psridhar: Hi all|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: big think there by N |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: hi |pg||
nt|haans: only 40 hcp exist|pg||
nt|psridhar: two high class pairs facing each other -should be an absorbing contest|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 5@D can be made true will see where he ends up|pg||
pc|h3|nt|rnmalik: but for the @S finesse had a good chance to make it.|pg||
nt|roswolf: never likely to be bid though|pg||
nt|brolucius: You see how light South's 2@S response is. Everyone does that nowadays, to allow partner to compete if he has extra trump-length. In the Bad Old Days, a raise to 2@S was considered ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: a 'free bid' (particularly in the USA) and promised a king's ransom.|pg||
nt|udo: and 4 @S NS  |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 3@D= bergen |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 4@S = 10/11 tricks |pg||
pc|h2|nt|Gerben42: if thats not a minimum hand I never saw one|pg||
nt|davidb: normal  450 . will be flat all over I believe|pg||

nt|brolucius: Italy has reached game on 4, I am told.|pg||
pc|h8|nt|mcarroll: Lebensohl|pg||
nt|andersk: must be the best weak 2 ever|pg||
nt|yuval10: 4+|pg||
nt|tomi2:  Hackett raised to 3@S with only 3 cad support. I play a cuebid by overcaller as 3 card support raise with maximum here, so 3@S would always be 4 cards for me|pg||
nt|yuval10: seem like a nice agreement|pg||
nt|yuval10: you have to play over the @h's in 4@s|pg||
nt|yuval10: Alfredo Versace is going down in 4@s in his match|pg||
nt|udo: 4@H is ok played from W|pg||

nt|yuval10: means that this contract isn't so easy |pg||
nt|mamos: this all looks odd|pg||
nt|MolvaM: while the results from their own group will be carried over|pg||
nt|xenya: well if N just had @HA instead of the King... |pg||
nt|lesh: 2@c prec, 2@s non forcing.However South has a decent hand he tried 4@s|pg||
nt|lesh: it also put pressure on the oppoinents and they might as here bid 5@d|pg||
nt|snetram:  moÅ¼e byÄ imponujacy wyÅcig, ale nie musi|pg||
nt|jkotor: E bêdzie musia³ nadbijaæ kara|pg||

nt|barnets: weakest|pg||
pc|s8|nt|eweber: 2NT was nat, nf|pg||

nt|ryskiel_: Armstrong or Contador?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I vote for 12|pg||
pc|s4|nt|peachy: with trumps not splitting, this will be tough to play, unless of course EW bids again (I doubt it)|pg||
nt|wygbe1: 6d is pretty  good, but the cards are not friendly|pg||
nt|lmeili: 3@c says 9+ red cards not min hand|pg||
nt|lmeili: tx Rado, 3@s may show sington @c|pg||
nt|tomi2:  what would you lead here?|pg||
nt|lmeili: probably @d, not @s not @h not @c|pg||
nt|tomi2:   seems to cause communication problems, but I cant Imagine to lead a @D from jxx|pg||
nt|motu: i guess i would lead a@H|pg||
nt|tomi2:  seems like a good idea too, in case S has also a singleton you cut this communication|pg||
nt|ziff:  I hope for a @D (obviously), but would lead a @H myself|pg||
nt|motu: with 3@C showing 9 red cards a @D lead looks unatraktiv for me|pg||
nt|haans: Blue Clubs with 5-c M|pg||
nt|cameron_1: I guess Tom chickened out and assumed David was under pressure picking a short major, even so|pg||
nt|ftpe: rigth|pg||

nt|Gerben42: Rudakov removed because of the @S problem, not because of his good suit|pg||
nt|wygbe1: play off 3 top clubs pitching h's and let e ruff|pg||
nt|peachy: declarer is likely to adopt that line, but then he has to deal with the H, S and club losers in hand|pg||
nt|peachy: might turn out too tuff|pg||
nt|wygbe1: yes, the line that works is to just ruff the 2 low clubs in dummy and draw trumps, finessing against d jack|pg||
nt|wygbe1: even that could run into difficulty|pg||
nt|h_karluk: oh yes, now i liked more Lawrence's Law of total tricks |pg||

nt|kdr_fm: board 2 btw needs to be rectified - E/W have to get the 2 black aces +2 is wrong|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Sweden made 4@H+1 on board 4, retake the lead|pg||
mb|1D|nt|boyklas: it seems that we have some connection problems|pg||
nt|h_karluk: board 6 and 23-0, wonder a recovery possible|pg||
nt|yuval10: not an easy game at all, it was|pg||
nt|yuval10: and now for a goulash hand|pg||
nt|tomi2:  I think 1@C is 2+@C for the German pair|pg||
nt|bagman: In the late 80's  passing out a deal was nearly impossible|pg||
nt|athene: EW might be able to create some confusion|pg||
nt|athene: with 11 -card spade fit|pg||
nt|antoniz: odzyskujemy przewagê psychiczn¹:)|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: after 5 hands |pg||
mb|p|nt|collins64: Mike is going to open 2@c with a weak major 2-suiter|pg||
nt|h_karluk: echo|pg||
nt|lechcold: przed 13 jest..poszli na wodê jednak:)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Gerben42: weak 2 in @D|pg||
nt|Gerben42: refreshingly natural|pg||
nt|eweber: there is a tiny little chance of an endplay vs South|pg||
nt|wygbe1: guess i missed something, down 1 looked pretty easy|pg||
nt|yuval10: really hard to predict what the final outcome here will be|pg||
nt|tomi2:  am no fan of double and no fan of redouble here. what contract does Della Monta want to play doubled, iff ops bid it?|pg||
nt|yuval10: X from S is dangerous in the sense that sometimes P will pass and you have very few defensive tricks for him|pg||
nt|tomi2:  yes|pg||
nt|roswolf: another straightforward board|pg||
nt|bagman: p-p|pg||
nt|athene: 2@S must be a takeout |pg||
nt|bagman: S is confident in his methods|pg||
nt|athene: takeout of spades|pg||
nt|fokal: 2@d shows @s , strong or weak|pg||
nt|fokal: hi all by the way|pg||
nt|athene: maybe 2@S is specifically michaels|pg||
nt|bagman: Is it T/O or 2-suiter?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi.|pg||
nt|athene: many pairs play "leaping michaels" over these bids, so 4@D would be reds|pg||
nt|bagman: hi|pg||
nt|fokal: so I guess 2@s shows a two suiters for sure|pg||
nt|athene: maybe NS don't play that or maybe south prefers to treat his hand as a 3-suiter|pg||
nt|bagman: N has an easy raise of the q-bid :)|pg||
nt|bagman: if methods permit such treatment|pg||
nt|hawe45:  So - I was late from another match|pg||
nt|athene: north pretty much just wants to RKCB in hearts|pg||
nt|athene: but he might have to set hearts first|pg||
nt|MolvaM: double now?|pg||
nt|andreasw:  1@s and 4@h after 3nt|pg||
nt|udo: 7@D|pg||
nt|udo: or NT|pg||
nt|udo: lets see|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is natural to bid 4@H rather than 5@C because it is a trick less. When the opponents go to 4@S and you want to bid at the five-level, you have a free choice between hearts and ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: clubs.|pg||
nt|8252: tu as donc 2 pseudos|pg||
nt|ralfwil: As you said Mike a classic preempt with a good result|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: denmark on lead 8-0 Iceland|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: hand nº 6 |pg||
nt|oleberg: 1@D shows 11-15, 4+ diamonds, can have longer clubs|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: seems a 4@H by West|pg||
nt|oleberg: (No, I'm not guessing :))|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: i agree with those 2 arguments you made|pg||
nt|shevek: neither side can make game|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 3nt seems not makable|pg||
nt|tomi2:  lauria only needs to find partner with two aces here, should be possible to find|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ziff:  In a marked contrast to our table Scotland and Italy have won 40 and 46 IMP in 5 boards.....|pg||
nt|lmeili: they should reach to 4@h, 1@c-1@d , 1N 2@c|pg||
nt|tomi2:  sometimes pd will jump to 2 level with 4 cards only and you have a hard bidding later|pg||
nt|tomi2:  os della Monatas hand now worth a raise to 6?|pg||
nt|yuval10: i believe W must add now....P is willing to play in the 5 level ALONE when he's VUL, and you have AK A?|pg||
nt|tomi2:  AKtx of trumps and the ace in their suit?|pg||
nt|yuval10: *she's|pg||
nt|yuval10: very likely that we'll see a sacrifice from NS|pg||
nt|tomi2:  if S bids 5@D now w has a difficult bid|pg||
nt|yuval10: Pass forcing?|pg||
nt|tomi2:  E-W are clearly in a forcing pass situation, but do you pass with TWO small dias?|pg||
nt|roswolf: unless n/s get carried away|pg||
nt|davidb: yes  no  great  boards yet...|pg||
nt|ady: can make 6NT    6@S  beaten on heart lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: the axe might descend here|pg||
nt|davidb: ??  aces...|pg||
nt|bagman: Ok, now let's see how the void is shown|pg||
nt|cameron_1: might chooce 4@s since Drijver's X was prob snapfragon style i.e. 2@s 5@c|pg||
nt|aldek: double showing clubs and a doubleton spade|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@D is natural. She has one diamond, so opens One Diamond.|pg||
nt|oleberg: And a good save in 4@S|pg||
nt|oleberg: Ok, a save|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: a block 3@S by N|pg||
nt|brolucius: Well, it was quite interesting how Gold approached the play - attacking his weakest suit first. |pg||
nt|odysseus69: a boring looking affair here|pg||
nt|odysseus69: can they look for a slam?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: dont think so|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: it's never easy to bid a grand slam which depends on a void (i.e. where you are off an ace)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: still a possible 5 imps missed|pg||
mb|2D|nt|eweber: but NS can escape by cashing their tricks|pg||
nt|lmeili: 2@h 3@h|pg||
nt|haans: close to spade raise|pg||
nt|yuval10: you have to do something with this AKTX trump and A@h|pg||
nt|cameron_1: choose a game i guess, a little strange because most use that to claim "ownership" and show a good hand|pg||
nt|mamos: what strength was 2@h   do we know - forcing ?|pg||
nt|mamos: will england bid on ?|pg||
nt|andreasw:  3nt should not win yes|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: could East X ?|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: can it be 3 card suport?|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: West can go alone to 5@H|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 5@H=11 tricks |pg||
nt|brolucius: England supporters can hope so.|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: he ruffed H with the Q, unnecessary|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like another boring hand|pg||
nt|lechcold: dziêki wejciu Brinka nasi dojd¹ do 3BA|pg||
mb|2S|nt|peachy: empting to Dbl with S hand|pg||
nt|peachy: tempting|pg||
nt|andersk: If 5@C makes, then 3 NT makes too|pg||
nt|bagman: If N can ask aces, S can bid quite a lot|pg||
nt|athene: did south think 4nt was asking for the minor?|pg||
nt|fokal: sementa has no idea of the @s void , he might try to protect his K of @s|pg||
nt|fokal: by bidding NT|pg||
nt|bagman: Now 5@S, I guess|pg||
nt|fokal: obvisously S interpreted 4NT as 'what is your minor , partner ? '|pg||
nt|athene: they might scramble into the grand if south finds 5@S now|pg||
nt|hawe45:  What was 2 @S exactly?|pg||
nt|bagman: It's bad to have your misunderstanding on a grand slam deal|pg||
nt|athene: but if there really has been a misunderstanding it's asking a lot to recover and go on to bid a tricky seven|pg||
nt|athene: 2@D showed spades, weak or strong (or some monster balanced)|pg||
nt|athene: so 2@S was obviously a cue - whatever they play that as|pg||
nt|hawe45:  So 5 @S now might do...|pg||
nt|cameron_1: i imagine tom was happy not to have to guess over an immediate 4@s from Brink|pg||
nt|MolvaM: thomas bids what he hopes he can make|pg||
nt|MolvaM: reasonable bid but doesnt work today|pg||
nt|MolvaM: but maybe pushes opps to 4@h|pg||
nt|xenya: 2N promises 20+|pg||
nt|Walddk2: His suit might not be solid :)|pg||
nt|lechcold: i wygraj¹|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 6T aurait eu une chance de gagner si E avait cache ses coeurs, mais evidemment 2C est 100% normale|pg||
nt|marlowepi: a cartes ouvertes c'est faisable meme sans entame coeur, mais le dec fera les deux impasses perdantes|pg||
nt|odysseus69: but maybe some exchanges|pg||
nt|cumino: J@D for a good slam instead of Q@C|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, I expect they will do their duty - taking a look for a slam - and then stop in game.|pg||
nt|bagman: Slam requires the spades to come in and diamond guess|pg||
nt|bagman: I have made worse slams |pg||
mb|p|nt|rigas_karo: 4@s in 5-1 fit in the oper room, probably +1|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: looks like an easy 3NT|pg||
nt|boyklas: its difficult to find the Jxx after this bidding, except if he lead it|pg||
nt|ady: should south double if they get to 6@S    might remove to 6NT|pg||
nt|psridhar: difficult to bid 5d on their own last bd- needed push from oppo|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: a part score 2@S by West|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so W missed to find 4/4 hearts fit|pg||
nt|odysseus69: yes - that would be good- but no wasted club cards is what West needs |pg||
mb|4S|nt|wygbe1: yep it is|pg||
nt|Walddk12: Good morning to Paul Hackett|pg||
nt|wygbe1: and it was |pg||
nt|ady: problem is not there|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w were merciful but have missed the boat somewhat|pg||
nt|cameron_1: it is usally right to bid on know double fit hands|pg||
nt|tomi2:  but he should not bid 4nt too fast, because it could be keycard for spades, and partner would sell @SAK and no @CA as two aces|pg||
nt|andersk: 4@S is makeable, but <i do not understand why Charlie didnt look for @H suit first|pg||
nt|andersk: need to do something good in @s to make|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: hand 5 other room playing 4@S same contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2:  not hackett should bid 5@H rather than double I think|pg||
nt|ady: sorry    blind spot    2 aces missing|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: can go -1 with a good defence timming|pg||
mb|p|nt|rigas_karo: well this is an easy way :)|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Morning everyone|pg||
nt|peachy: Good morning Paul|pg||
nt|wygbe1: morning|pg||
nt|yuval10: very interesting sequence to work with your partner|pg||
nt|bagman: When a misunderstaning occurs, it's difficult to recover, because neither player knows what the misunderstanding has been|pg||
nt|athene: even if both players suspect, neither one can be sure his partner is in on the secret|pg||
nt|bagman: If N thinks that S has 1 ace and @S-void, he still cannot bid the grand|pg||
nt|athene: these sort of auctions are where top pairs really have to put in the time away from the table|pg||
nt|athene: because there are lots of imps riding on these hands|pg||
nt|lechcold: ogranicznie nie znoszê takich wejæ:)...|pg||
nt|aldek: zgadzam sie|pg||
nt|aldek: ale w holandii nie moge nikogo przekonac ze to sensu nie ma|pg||
nt|8252: c'est mieux comme ça, l'entame @h donnait la 12 ème, mais DAFILO n'aurait pas filé|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 11 trickd from top as @dJ is Jxx|pg||
nt|mdgraham: This hand would be perfect for Christmas Party bridge - One Diamond, Two Spades, Three Hearts, Three NoTrump |pg||
nt|mdgraham: Natural Bidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|boyklas: thats true|pg||
nt|athene: even if they don't come up all that often|pg||

nt|snetram:  za wzgledu na depresjÄ. PoniÅ¼ej poziomu morza tak bywa|pg||
nt|justin c: 4@C...|pg||
pc|h4|nt|Gerben42: this contract will be no problem, will duck once to guard against 5-2 @C|pg||
nt|ziff:  2@Sx would have been 3 down at least on a @D lead or switch, but not easy to find, and 620 are available|pg||
nt|star6ija: 11 tricks|pg||
nt|antoniz: Adam zagra przez trefle z powodów komunikacyjnych|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Good evening to Peter Gill|pg||
nt|brolucius: If West shows any interest in a slam (no, I see he has signed off), East would go there with three aces.|pg||
pc|h9|nt|paulhac:  It is a playable game just but not with the trump break they did well to only go 1 off in the othere room|pg||
nt|lmeili: after 1@c 1@d what is 1N shows? some player holds 7 HCP as E they may not inv to game|pg||
nt|andersk: this will be -2 or more|pg||
nt|MolvaM: what about 5@c?|pg||
nt|udo: @D agreed now ?|pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: Czy wygra, to zobaczymy... W jasne karty ³atwo|pg||
pc|hT|nt|brolucius: 5@H, cue-bid denying a club control. Now 6@C will show first-round club control.|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|wygbe1: playing for 50 hearts, could set up spades and run them through south for down 1, losintg ak of spades and 2 hearts|pg||
nt|h_karluk: -3|pg||
nt|h_karluk: just play off top hearts|pg||
nt|andersk: I know - 3 double dummy, but they dont see all cards:)|pg||
nt|rodvenn: In practice 3@h is a good bid|pg||
nt|h_karluk: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_total_tricks|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer is happy to see this dummy; quite sure make and quite a bad slam|pg||
nt|cumino: But EST is 12-14 bal, there isn't many cards for slam|pg||
nt|brolucius: A few pairs will get too high, you can be sure.|pg||
nt|olegario: E needed a bit more to try|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|Gerben42: sry always 2nd stopper|pg||
nt|eweber: just heard the second match of the Dutch was 11-19 vs Spain|pg||
nt|aldek: 4@S was close as well|pg||
nt|tomi2:  with 5@H he committses himself to 6 level even if partners @C were QJT, or does 4@S also show @C control?|pg||
nt|udo: hard now|pg||
pc|s2|nt|motu: depends on vul|pg||
nt|h_karluk: true|pg||
nt|yuval10: now only 2 down....can't be good for the leaders|pg||
nt|xenya: 12 tricks |pg||
nt|ftpe: yes|pg||
nt|ftpe: south should play club|pg||
nt|brolucius: Versace may think: 'I must have club ace to suggest a grand slam (with another spade cue-bid), so this is more accurate, showing @SK too.|pg||
nt|lesh: have to guess right|pg||
nt|petergill: Hi everyone|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ziff:  undo?|pg||

nt|andersk: Do you good people understand the 5@C raise?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: if we are talking abt std signals|pg||
nt|andersk: I would probably try 3 NT|pg||
nt|h_karluk: by N?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: yes lots of game plus - but slam minus  hands|pg||
pc|s5|nt|eweber: results of round 2 are online by now |pg||
nt|eweber: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/10Ostend/asp/roundteams.asp?qtournid=820&qroundno=2|pg||
nt|eweber: England leading the group with 50(!)|pg||
nt|eweber: Russia 13th with 27|pg||
nt|eweber: NL 17th of 19 with 17|pg||
nt|othered1: But first south recues @S, guaranteeing some kind of @C control, I'd think|pg||
nt|udo: 5@S is ?|pg||
nt|brolucius: He would just bid 6@D with second-round club control.|pg||
nt|tomi2:  5@S = both black aces|pg||
nt|udo: i am told @S king and first round club|pg||
nt|brolucius: Well, he has already shown @SA, hasn't he? (With 4@S).|pg||
nt|tomi2:  probably with no @SK he'd bid 6@C|pg||
nt|brolucius: Indeed.|pg||
nt|udo: and 6@D with second round @C controll?|pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: Teraz to zmusili Go do zrobienia nadróbki...|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mamos: England have done well on this board I feel|pg||
nt|othered1: And Lauria selects the highest scoring (and unbreakable, if partner has 1@D) spot.|pg||
pc|s4|nt|haans: Bulgaria do not play Blue Clubs but Precision|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: dangerous but works here |pg||
nt|psridhar: true 3h makes -but two eight card fits deterred the pairs from venturing into 3 level -THE LAW :)|pg||
nt|tomi2:  problem is again, waht does he bid with no club control? 5nt is nonforcing?|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|boyklas: 4C at te open room? not 4S?|pg||
nt|lmeili: tx, that means they'll reach 4@h any how|pg||
nt|andersk: Need AQxxxxx and almost nothing more for it to be makeable|pg||
nt|roswolf: israel avoided the slam on bd 3 in the other room and so gained 11|pg||
nt|star6ija: yes|pg||
nt|star6ija: no trump is 14-16...and some new gadgets over 1@c openning|pg||
nt|brolucius: But it was West who had the chance to make a try. East was merely following the route to describe 12-14 with three spades.|pg||
pc|cT|nt|mcarroll: In a word - No - I do not understand it|pg||
nt|andersk: 3 NT is my choise|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hard to reach there|pg||
nt|andersk: hard to reach 3 NT?|pg||
nt|andersk: Just pull it out of your bidding box:)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: can you make a sample bidding?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: LOL|pg||
nt|h_karluk: it should be played by N|pg||
nt|aldek: could not do better|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hellom Peter|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mamos: surely not|pg||
nt|mamos: not @hK|pg||
nt|xenya: but declarer can either get @Ds righ or squeeze N in the reds |pg||
nt|rodvenn: that is not the law as I understand it|pg||
nt|bagman: WIth no transportation possible between the defenders, declarer took the sure way to make his game|pg||
pc|c7|nt|jkmjanusz: 5@C w 5 tylko bez jednej. 16 IMP|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 9 tricks.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: welcome again.|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h3|nt|rigas_karo: West bid 4@s over 2@h|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: but maybe he bid 4@c to indicate @c +@s and east (reasonably) passed with singleton @s|pg||
nt|collins64: no Filippos opened 2@h with his 6-card J|pg||
nt|andersk: I understan that 3 @S is a tempting bid|pg||
nt|star6ija: this sequence showed 4-4-4-1 singleton not defined, 2N was relay and 3@c showed @d singleton - 4@h denies control outside|pg||
nt|aldek: the operator is in trouble, it seems|pg||
nt|mamos: vugraph op???????   you there?|pg||
nt|xenya: for the same result|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: 3NT might have made iF south led a high heart .... but 4@C is going 4 off|pg||
pc|hA|nt|collins64: and West bid 4@c with his 55 passed by East|pg||
nt|boyklas: ok, 10 imps for greece|pg||
nt|cameron_1: seems right result|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|rodvenn: two 8-card fits make you compete to the 3-level according to the law|pg||

nt|jameslee 2: to take opps out of the 8 card fit |pg||
nt|haans: 8 carder outside of the law|pg||
nt|h_karluk: thanks to Marty and Larry, sorry for wrong remembered that devised by Mike|pg||

nt|bagman: He needs to guess 3 things: a) 5@D shows the 2nd suit, b) S has 2 aces, c) S has @S-void|pg||
nt|athene: well there's no way anyone is guessing all that|pg||
nt|athene: what they need is some way for north to agree hearts|pg||
nt|athene: then it's relatively easy|pg||
nt|athene: but slam auctions are hard when no-one knows what trumps are|pg||
nt|bagman: I'm sure they'll go back to the drawing board after this match|pg||
nt|santyclz: Perhaps 3@s over 2?  |pg||
nt|athene: it's sort of like trying to build the top story of a house of cards and then fill in the first layers later|pg||
nt|psridhar: of course it is genral precription -law can go wrong at times|pg||
nt|lechcold: tak by by³o i tutaj, gdyby nie pomocna d³oñ Brinka|pg||
nt|marlowepi: pour repondre publiquement aux specs qui demandent comment reussir a cartes ouvertes: supposons entame K. as de K. K coupe. AR d'atout, as de pique, pique pour la dame, K coupe.  ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: puis roi de pique. si S ne coupe pas, mise en main avec trefle|pg||
nt|petergill: Here's a picture of North and South|pg||
nt|petergill: A picture is worth a thousand words|pg||
nt|petergill: http://www.acbl.org/nabc/2008/03/highlights/Boston2008/junior_bridge_players.html|pg||
nt|oleberg: Fireworks!|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: where ?|pg||
nt|oleberg: Here. (I hope)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lesh: a peaceful 4@h here, but lets see|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i guess slam @h|pg||
mb|1D|nt|wygbe1: several roads to down one, as long as declarer assumes s has all the trumps|pg||
nt|yuval10: NS in the OR found the 6@d sac.|pg||
nt|roswolf: bd2 was flat when 4@S was also allowed to make|pg||
nt|fokal: on 6@h it seems clear to me that north couldn't make a move|pg||
nt|star6ija: operator, please try to follow the moves more precisely|pg||
nt|cameron_1: flat borad|pg||
nt|mamos: multi|pg||
nt|ftpe: ew migth go to 4 he here|pg||
nt|h_karluk: in practice very hard to reach, given layout diamonds favorably placed|pg||
nt|chick: Hamdi, the LoTT was originally devised by Vernes.  Cohen and Bergen popularized it, and Lawrence is the one who wrote "I fought the Law ..." disputing it's value :)|pg||
nt|pikolo: co ty bal na 8 inwituje |pg||
nt|kdr_fm: board 4 the austrian west did indeed bid 2@d Just like u suggest and another double swing|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: Spain had some yeterday againtx portugal at football :)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: maybe over 2D there were some other exciting responses- maybe 3D to show 5 good diamonds and 3 spades|pg||
mb|1H|nt|h_karluk: unless Sweden gifts some seems Austria's this team couldn't scratch something useful|pg||
nt|haans: standard bidding in 2nd hand no 2@H|pg||
nt|yuval10: so "only" 5 imps to Austria|pg||
nt|mamos: i think youd want to be in game|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 5c has much chances if declare can manage the 4-0 split|pg||
nt|tomi2:  7@D could be in danger of some ruff, not likely, but why take the risc...|pg||
mb|1S|nt|peachy: 4H rolls now,, on lucky spade sit|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Although the K@S is right the K@D is wrong so 4@H is an excellent contract|pg||
nt|peachy: EW have a paying sacrifice, rare at Vul|pg||
nt|andersk: Might be possible to bid game here|pg||
nt|bagman: If North was confident that 4NT was RKCB in hearts, that was a good bid; no need to re-cue with 3@S|pg||
nt|fokal: but maybe S could (should ?) have bid something else than 6@h|pg||
nt|haans: the law is not the law just suggestions :)|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: another part score hand |pg||
nt|udo: guess after 3 NT Lauria gave him club A or King|pg||
nt|brolucius: If North has a club more and a diamond fewer, he would be delighted to hear of the @SK, which would give a second club discard.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: not guilty Maam :) i was living in an ocean away and the internet was not invented. i was just thirsty and eager to buy any foreign bridge book, thanks |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 2NT no move after |pg||
nt|oleberg: Boring partial|pg||
mb|p|nt|motu: 1N is 9+  with 4cMajor possible as you can see|pg||
nt|ftpe: ahh, not any longer :)|pg||
nt|chick: 1N should warn S off from doing anything unilaterally and dramatic :)|pg||
nt|jkotor: na drugim zbieg³o 1nt|pg||
nt|oleberg: I wouldn't like to open the South hand 2nt. Partner might pass.|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 2NT= 8 tricks |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: think he will claim |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: straigh away|pg||
nt|brolucius: No doubt a double would show 4+ spades and 1@S denies spades.|pg||
mb|1N|nt|paulhac:  Isnt it 800?|pg||
nt|peachy: oops|pg||
nt|peachy: I think I need another cup of coffee!!!|pg||
nt|wygbe1: if n had just shown limit raise values for hearts, they would be in the easy 4h contract|pg||
nt|paulhac:  6@D is only on the K@D 50% almost|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Without a heart ruff|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 4 cards M 4th seat|pg||
nt|andersk: looks like NT has to be played by S, but 5@D makes|pg||
nt|h_karluk: quite gross dissortion|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT   for n/s looks normal|pg||
nt|athene: well, it was only good if he was confident and he knew his partner was confident it was, too :)|pg||
nt|athene: that is one strange double of 1@C|pg||
nt|bagman: In confusion, it's often a good idea to bid something, which can be passed )|pg||
nt|fokal: X from sementa seems artificial|pg||
nt|haans: why did S not bid 3@H|pg||
nt|xenya: my assignment was for Closed Room|pg||
nt|lechcold: 4333? no nie wiem...kiedy co prawda Adam otwiera³ 1BA do 18:)|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: jedno jest pewne - 2@H uruchomic musia³o Bala, a pas niekoniecznie|pg||
nt|marlowepi: sur entame pique, quasi-pareil|pg||
nt|justin c: ireland might bid 6@S tho, and maybe get 3NT through on the previous one|pg||
nt|oleberg: Which is right here, but I would hold my breath, to see dummy|pg||
nt|odysseus69: balanced 11s and wiith 3 10s- they call you mad now if you pass even in 2nd seat vul|pg||
mb|2D|nt|rigas_karo: double is transfer for @h?|pg||
nt|fokal: some kind of transfer ?|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes'|pg||
nt|haans: believe it to much and you go wrong|pg||
nt|justin c: could change that scoreline very quickly, potentially|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: 4@S+3 on the slam board 1 imp|pg||
mb|p|nt|boyklas: maybe|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: should be|pg||
nt|wygbe1: i really think it is wrong to make a neg x with a fit for opener's major, this auction is one example of why |pg||
nt|yuval10: if N bids 3NT here def. must find the @d lead/switch|pg||
nt|bagman: I have never declared a splinter, but my partners have on some occasions |pg||
nt|xenya: sorry private|pg||
nt|pikolo: bal jest zawsze uruchomiony kwestia tylko jak bardzo :)|pg||
nt|justin c: ugh|pg||
nt|petergill: Fiona Brown and Susan Stockdale were top of the datums (Butler Scores), the last time I looked|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 3nt is ok on N |pg||
nt|petergill: Yes that's the only game that makes, if hearts are led|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@C 17+, 1@H 8+ balanced|pg||
nt|petergill: NS Convention Card http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/May/WomensTeams/sweden/SandraRimstedt-EmmaSjoberg_SWEDEN_WOMEN.pdf |pg||
nt|mdgraham: there's something odd about the NS system file from ECATS. Page 1 is ok, but page 2 is peculair |pg||
nt|petergill: 3@S by South then 3NT by North, maybe?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@H looks like a control response, but I can't read the print|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@H = 8+ HCP, no 6m, no 5M, not 4M and longer suit is roughly what I can read |pg||
nt|brolucius: I am often thought of as mad in that respect.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 1S denies spades|pg||
mb|2S|nt|udo: 1@H is transfer ?|pg||
nt|lesh: well a trouble for S now|pg||
nt|snetram:  z 8 karami S zapewne powie 5 karo|pg||
mb|p|nt|rigas_karo: i think anastasiadis will claim 7 tricks here..|pg||
nt|rnmalik: can NS make a slam?|pg||
nt|andersk: @C lead|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: wczoraj widzia³em brak uruchomienia ze strony Cezarego, wiêc nie zawsze Jacku|pg||
nt|snetram:  N ma rzeczywisty problem|pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: Cza Bal bez lew defensywnych nie npowinien powiedzieæ 5@H?|pg||
nt|lechcold: 5@H bardzo op³acalne|pg||
nt|aldek: bez jednej tylko|pg||
nt|snetram:  wczeÅniejsza kontra byÅa bÅÄdem, pas byÅby forsujacy |pg||
nt|snetram:  i lepiej sprzedaÅby intencje gracza N|pg||
nt|jkotor: do tego momentu wszystko w PO tak samo|pg||
nt|jkotor: i N myli|pg||
nt|pikolo: wygl¹da ¿e powie 6|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: a w PiS-ie?|pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: Tak, Krzysztof Martens ma racjê |pg||
nt|aldek: do niedawna Brink Drijver grali na odwrot|pg||
nt|snetram:  teraz wyÅÄczenie kier kusi|pg||
nt|aldek: kontra zachecajaca do dalszej licytacji|pg||
nt|antoniz: mo¿e skusi|pg||
nt|jkotor: Narkiewicz do³o¿y³ 6@d|pg||
nt|snetram:  jak zachÄciÅ to nad czym teraz mysli?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Pour les spectateurs: Marlowepi ne joue que Ã¡ cartes ouvertes|pg||
nt|petergill: which sounds like "balanced" to me|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 2D must show spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|collins64: after minor opening and opponent's double they play transfer|pg||
nt|yuval10: 5@c is cold, so many imps here on the line perhaps|pg||
nt|MolvaM: hands seem to be quiet, compared to the previous match|pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: Mo¿e wypuszcz¹?|pg||
nt|aldek: ale ostatnio zrezygnowali z tego pomyslu|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: alot of bidding again on a poor 7 count|pg||
nt|barnets: hacketts did bid 5@D as I suggested - will be another england swing|pg||
nt|barnets: not even x|pg||
nt|cumino: 5@d not doubledb board 4|pg||
mb|p|nt|boyklas: take 5D, 1S, 1H and leave|pg||
nt|lmeili: though 6@d makable, i would prefer for 3N|pg||
nt|tomi2:  they are on their way to 6@D it seems :)|pg||
nt|motu: 4@D is aceasking|pg||
nt|tomi2:  not 4@C?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: no matter @c lead|pg||
nt|andersk: @C A AQ in @S and @H J|pg||
nt|haans: 5@D jump may be based on previous bidding|pg||
nt|MolvaM: no 7600 distribution so far :)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  sry was away for a bid there:)|pg||
nt|ftpe: well ew had play for 4 hearts, but ns bougth contract in 2 cl on 4-3 fit|pg||
nt|barnets: 5@D passed out big swing for england|pg||
pc|c4|nt|eweber: Imp scoring doesn't seem to work, 5 Imps for Russia until Board 4, if I count correctly|pg||
nt|h_karluk: quickly jettison loser|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: good lord even adding T + 9 I cant see how N is worth 3 bids|pg||
nt|brolucius: A clever method, showing spades but not going past the safety level of 2@H.|pg||
pc|c7|nt|motu: 4@C would be aceasking for @S|pg||
nt|tomi2:  but is @S suit possible after not raising?|pg||
nt|lmeili: 4th step shows how many key cards?|pg||
nt|tomi2:  2+@Dq|pg||
nt|motu: 2+ trump Q|pg||
nt|lmeili: tx|pg||
nt|h_karluk: to spades|pg||
nt|h_karluk: overtakes K and enjoys|pg||
nt|roswolf: with the diamonds 3-2 no problem|pg||
nt|udo: must be|pg||
nt|udo: 11 tricks,, next:)|pg||
nt|brolucius: 1@H must have been a transfer but I cannot see anything about it on the conv-card that I have up.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: mais aux yeux fermes|pg||
nt|barnets: so very fast start for england here|pg||
nt|odysseus69: this is going well for England but more significantly for Israel|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|paulhac:  Best lead but he could have led anything|pg||
nt|MolvaM: u didnt miss much andreas|pg||
nt|andreasw:  great:)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: declarer tries to protect himself against the 2 diamond honors being offside|pg||
nt|MolvaM: so he just gave up a heart trick that he could establish by taking his @hA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes it is, X would have shown hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They play transfers after interference|pg||
nt|udo: last time i played them ( San Remo),, they played transfers|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think a tad stretched 2@s works better than X there|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: na drugim stole to samo - arcymistrzowski overbid|pg||
nt|petergill: Fiona not missing out on the extra 100, plus a heart lead (sdummy's first bid "suit might ensue from her Dbl|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Dhondy used Leaping Michaels (4@D) over the 3@C opener. Wrong time - 500|pg||
nt|petergill: which would be great if South had another heart|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|MolvaM: the computer dealt hands makes everyone paranoid a little bit after a while|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: good starting duck by S in  trick 1 |pg||
nt|aldek: moze mu sie juz wszystko pokrecilo|pg||
nt|hawe45:  OK|pg||
pc|cA|nt|kdr_fm: whats extrodinary is that 3NT is going to be real hard to beat|pg||
pc|c2|nt|bagman: AK and a low heart?|pg||
nt|lechcold: tym rozdaniem obie pary NS nie bêd¹ mog³y siê specjalnie szczyciæ|pg||
nt|snetram:  oby siÄ para B-N nie zagotowaÅa. MajÄ dwa zÅe rozdania|pg||
nt|james_h: not on this lead|pg||
nt|brolucius: All commentators are impartial, of course, but that only refers to their utterances on the screen. Some of them are cheering loudly at each swing in the right direction.|pg||
pc|c5|nt|motu: everything is possible here:)|pg||
nt|athene: just the five obvious tricks to lose here|pg||
nt|petergill: Susan as expected leads a heart - dummy's first bid "suit", after the Dbl|pg||
nt|odysseus69: best to cash 2nd club -then d|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|eweber: no miracle in the 4@h contract, but an imp for Russia anyway|pg||
nt|tomi2:  so 1 kexcard is missing and they stop in (a bad) game - I am no fan of this auction...|pg||
nt|chick: or a simple 2@H overcall|pg||
nt|justin c: hi james|pg||
pc|d7|nt|lmeili: at least it makes even guess wrong @s|pg||
pc|dK|nt|h_karluk: just needs to play a trump|pg||
nt|h_karluk: say East played Ace and switched back to @c|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ruff with K|pg||
nt|athene: red ace-kings and a diamond ruff|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: no entrys in West to develope the @D |pg||
nt|h_karluk: well aren't we ready to play at least 3 level in any suit ? |pg||
nt|chick: EW potentially had 3N, so a disaster for NS is not a given|pg||
nt|lesh: a possible 800, South has to be careful|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: tam król kier sie utrzyma³|pg||
nt|aldek: problem jest nastepujacy, jak pas jest forsujacy to czy zaprasza do 5-ciu czy do 6-ciu|pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: E - nie nmajak wypucic...|pg||
nt|8252: EO vont mener 4 0 mais ça va s'arreter là|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: ya east has too many entries|pg||
nt|bagman: The defense can take 2 clubs, a diamond and two trumps + a trick|pg||
nt|bagman: the trick can be either 3rd trump wiht a diamond overruff or a heart|pg||
nt|odysseus69: and now 3rd club|pg||
pc|dA|nt|collins64: about the previous deal, you always have to discuss before is it or not GF 4@c overcall after weak 2@h opening|pg||
nt|MolvaM: now he can do his throw in|pg||
nt|jkotor: to mówi: "nie wiem czy ich X, czy graæ wy¿ej"|pg||
nt|jkotor: tak przynajmniej ja rozumiem pasa forsuj¹cego|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @h A  favorably placed|pg||
nt|MolvaM: which he didnt need actually :)|pg||
nt|james_h: hi boyz|pg||
nt|petergill: Fiona will (eventually, there's no rush) cash out|pg||
pc|c6|pc|s6|nt|athene: no chance for the defence to get a trump promotion going and i don't see why declarer should take a backwards trump finesse|pg||
nt|xenya: S showed 5-4 in the minors, but clubs could longer than diamonds, so N had to guess -- hence his pass over 2@C|pg||
pc|c3|nt|collins64: West had a very nice hand with 19HCP and East Pass with 2 Kings and a 7-card Q10 suit|pg||
nt|rnmalik: oops|pg||
nt|haans: we all see the clubs finesse|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|d9|nt|andersk: wrong slam|pg||
nt|andersk: normal line|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 10 @C could come in play |pg||
pc|d6|nt|collins64: x Kxx Q10xxxxx KJ|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: if 4@c is not GF easts is reasonable however, he thinks the hand is a misfit, and his K@h can be a wasted value|pg||
nt|andersk: a lucky make|pg||
nt|andersk: since @H K is together with 3 card @S|pg||
nt|rnmalik: no on a @H finesse can make 7. @D lead would force him to take a finesse.|pg||
nt|andersk: I must be sleeping, 6 is alw cold|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: Sorry for the rush for the previous deql now we are align with the players|pg||
nt|rnmalik: ok and thanks.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but still may go down|pg||
nt|davidb: board  6  was classical  SPL   -suit preference lead -  high H for D |pg||
nt|ady: ooops     Patchman trying to protect possible entry and clear the hearts|pg||
nt|andreasw:  ok 9 trick's |pg||
nt|mdgraham: pity about the club ruff|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|motu: i do not see why E went beyond 3N since 2N shoed allready extras|pg||
nt|ziff:  Not easy to bid, as W may have 5 @D and @SA instead of KJ, making slam pretty good|pg||
nt|bagman: No trump promotion but the old fashioned tap|pg||
nt|bagman: Now a heart and ruff with 9 ?|pg||
nt|haans: best not is spades|pg||
nt|aldek: who should bid 4, east or west?|pg||
nt|rodvenn: not vulnerable you should, according to the law, always compete to the 3-level holding 8 against 8. They make, you go one down in the typical example|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Ivan needs subway tickets to enter the table and that doesn't help much|pg||
nt|petergill: the club ruffs were hard to find - EW will be happy with plus 200|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|ziff:  Hope springs eternal, as they say, but I agree that it was agressive|pg||
nt|athene: he is more likely to ruff with the queen surely|pg||
nt|MolvaM: but its good for discussions after the match with yr teammates: "I could have made it even if both @d honors were off"|pg||
nt|haans: Body in clubs very good|pg||
nt|rodvenn: of course you may feel that your hand has intermideate cards in their suit which makes you take another course|pg||
nt|petergill: @SA then @HA is what I would do|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But is X only for a @h lead? not in my opinion, so a @c lead is not so far away. But in nt - yes|pg||
pc|h2|nt|eweber: I don't count correcly, 4:1 is correct|pg||
nt|h_karluk: now trump promo possible|pg||
nt|bagman: what would you do then?|pg||
nt|cameron_1: i think they play the method 3m=non max lin linked M and 3M=max in other M|pg||
nt|mamos: I dont think West can    |pg||
nt|haans: endplay in hearts|pg||
pc|hT|nt|rnmalik: No @H finesse 6.|pg||
nt|andersk: East will get a trumph raise|pg||
nt|ftpe: will be poor result for ns i think|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|andersk: unfortunate for the sweeds|pg||
nt|h_karluk: the declarer should play a trump to K before touching @h|pg||
nt|cameron_1: so it was up to tom|pg||
nt|udo: hm,,,,was this the best line?|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|rnmalik: tricky hand after very good lead of @D. we have seen all cards so easy for us.:)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3@S in E is key to its making without finesse also which is % wise low.|pg||
nt|andersk: Austrians|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ruff and do that - now or never|pg||
nt|haans: and a make???|pg||
nt|h_karluk: not really|pg||
nt|h_karluk: if pitches and plays a trump to table goes down to @c shift|pg||
nt|h_karluk: if ruffs and plays a trump to hand always makes, thinner than a hair line|pg||
nt|haans: best play was not to cover|pg||
nt|Walddk12: Good morning to Peter Crouch|pg||
nt|xenya: quite poor, yes|pg||
nt|xenya: 2@D is certainly better, although i'm not sure it makes |pg||
nt|lesh: 500 now, against 4@h it is a good result|pg||
nt|marlowepi: un spec astucieux note que 6P est faisable sur la donne precedente|pg||
nt|james_h: Terry is watchin the pips|pg||
pc|hA|nt|motu: with a decent hand and 5-5 W will make move over 3nt|pg||
nt|h_karluk: as we see all cards easy, i doubt same for him/her|pg||
pc|h7|nt|andreasw:  :) *i could*|pg||
nt|lesh: here is nothing East can do to prevent South from taking 3more spade tricks|pg||
pc|d3|pc|hK|pg||
nt|ziff:  If 2N showed extras, yes|pg||
nt|mamos: same auction exactly in OR|pg||
nt|haans: well done|pg||
nt|james_h: hence taking the @sA|pg||
nt|james_h: Terry (W)|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: S will hope the @CA is with west now|pg||
nt|james_h: I dont think he has great expectations|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: well AQ9xx and ace is enough to double 2@d ... but he'll be disappointed|pg||
pc|h5|nt|xenya: best he could do was play the @SQ|pg||
nt|bagman: Now declarer is quite badly placed. He'll probably ruffs a heart high|pg||
pc|h8|nt|h_karluk: that's off one|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: he is full off 10/9 cards fos Nt contract lovely deal |pg||
pc|s9|nt|h_karluk: fifty fifty, 3 tricks for EW also|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|ftpe: well|pg||
nt|ftpe: ew migthy bid 4 he|pg||
pc|dT|nt|andersk: had to start with a small @D from dummy, to avoid truph promotion|pg||
pc|s8|nt|haans: kick them when they are down|pg||
nt|james_h: I dont think She has great expectstions (thanks kib)|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|xenya: 3 off now|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|bagman: Bocchi's trump big enough to score|pg||

nt|collins64: if it is NF|pg||
nt|paulhac:  England takes the lead for the first time.|pg||
nt|andersk: unlucky board for the Austrians|pg||
nt|h_karluk: west still should refuse to overruff for a late trump promo possibility|pg||
nt|yuval10: and she did|pg||
nt|roswolf: overtrick imps to ireland|pg||
nt|bagman: sure, Q works when there is a legal chance for beat|pg||
nt|bagman: 9 works only as deception|pg||
nt|andreasw:  again board 4 is wrong!!!|pg||
nt|shevek: quite a few declarers went down in 3NT here|pg||
nt|MolvaM: andreas maybe you shld forget the past and move on :)|pg||
nt|xenya: strange -- perhaps the real play was different|pg||
nt|udo: i am not yet awake, but i doubt it|pg||
nt|marlowepi: mais encore une fois c'est a cartes ouvertes|pg||
nt|ralfwil: this will be fast. take the 8 first and run|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: 2 suiter i think|pg||
nt|roswolf: they multi with a 1 suiter weak 2|pg||
nt|bagman: or is it actually so?|pg||
nt|andreasw:  neeeverrr:)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 3@c shows what?|pg||
nt|shevek: no, not from here !|pg||
nt|MolvaM: both minors?|pg||
nt|shevek: 3@c = 5-5 in the minors|pg||
nt|andreasw:  it should|pg||
nt|hawe45:  E/O ou N/S?|pg||
mb|p|nt|collins64: another 2@c opening in North|pg||
nt|athene: will south double 2@H or bid 2@S?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|andersk: Italy running good in Bridge, but currently out of the world cup|pg||
nt|star6ija: 3N is possible here|pg||
nt|aldek: I'd say west should bid on the base of the quality of the spades, an ace and a singleton|pg||
nt|cameron_1: i agree|pg||
nt|andreasw:  i will go a few times and be back after 10 second's have to see score's from danaish match:)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  danish*|pg||

nt|justin c: decent 6@S here|pg||
nt|eamongall: well folks ye better get your armour on ...as Michael has just been mugged in the other room |pg||
mb|2H|nt|collins64: both majors at least 44|pg||
nt|boyklas: i think he judged that the hand shouldnt be to game with the singleton S and the KH wasted value after showing C+S|pg||
nt|bagman: If partner has Txx left, both the 9 and the Q work; what about other holdings?|pg||
nt|ftpe: boring cards again|pg||
nt|justin c: expect south will drive to slam now|pg||
mb|2S|nt|star6ija: stubborn @s stopper|pg||

nt|udo: me too,,,therefore i asked only:)|pg||
nt|othered1: for 10 tricks, I don't see better|pg||
nt|brolucius: The players in the Open Room are not exactly burning the baize with their playing speed, They are three boards behind already.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 7 boards and 24 IMPs exchanged, interesting|pg||
nt|aldek: przeczytaj moje pytanie, prosze|pg||
nt|petergill: EW Convention Card http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/May/WomensTeams/england/stockdale-brown.pdf|pg||
nt|bagman: NS can make 4@H here, the 11th trick can come from the spade lead or spade guess|pg||
nt|brolucius: Gold found an 11-count that he was willing to pass. (Only a jack in the long suit, and four jacks in all.)|pg||
nt|bagman: Now he needs to describe the 'impossible' hand|pg||
mb|2N|nt|jameslee 2: East a take out 2@D on a dangerous 1Nt X|pg||
nt|lesh: probably E will bid 2@s or 2@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulhac:  IF East had been the overcaller one could say that Spain were unlucky|pg||
nt|h_karluk: well, sorry i disagree that was unlucky|pg||
nt|roswolf: south will no doubt transfer and offer his pard a choice of games|pg||
nt|shevek: you can watch any match here :)  http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|andreasw:  thx mucht|pg||
nt|andreasw:  3@h slam invit?|pg||
nt|shevek: looks like it|pg||
nt|andreasw:  no best slam with @d AK out:)|pg||
nt|shevek: but 5@d is not a make|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 5d seems ok since defence cannot take their club ruff with a small trump|pg||
nt|rodvenn: Very good bridge to reach 5 @d in both rooms. |pg||
nt|james_h: 2@d XX being played at the other table|pg||
nt|james_h: NS|pg||
nt|eamongall: The Great Mulall managed 2@DXX a few months ago in the Regent up 3 ... Michael is not having the same success |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: another missfit in @S for N-S|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: shooting to 3NT |pg||
nt|brolucius: He may bid 3@S to show a sound raise to 4@H. No, 2NT does the job.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 2NT is a heart raise|pg||
nt|odysseus69: cant imagine them missing game|pg||
nt|bagman: Townsend has enought to bid/force to game|pg||
mb|3C|nt|xenya: or the score is wrong -- that happens from time to time|pg||
nt|lesh: but over 2@h West might blast to a game|pg||
nt|oleberg: The natural @D lead, will give the 9.th trick immidiately|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 3NT with a missfit is alays veryvery dificult |pg||
nt|oleberg: The natural heart lead is better :)|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 1 of the thing we try to teach bridge students is to go to game to 3NT with a fit in a minor |pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: don't think a major suit game is possible|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: Buras wita sie z g¹sk¹ - poszli mu w kiera...|pg||
nt|hawe45:  OK - cÂ´est possible|pg||
nt|petergill: EW at the other table won the World Junior (U26) Pairs Championship in 2006 in Piestany, Slovakia, the only female pair ever to do so|pg||
nt|petergill: Cecilia Rimstedt was only 18 at the time, I think|pg||
mb|4H|nt|peachy: 2NT might have been alerted, otherwise I don't understand it|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 5@d good|pg||
nt|shevek: actually might make|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: second X pass out |pg||
nt|psridhar: this can be set 800|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: quite  a few down -3/-4 could be the result|pg||
nt|brolucius: If Madala had passed, some use 2NT by North to show a sound four-card heart raise and 2@S to show a sound three-card raise.|pg||
mb|p|nt|wygbe1: probably lebensohl|pg||
nt|santyclz: The 6@h+1 ended as a push.  Neither n/s was able to overcome the preempt.|pg||
nt|star6ija: happens... :)|pg||
nt|shevek: yes|pg||
nt|haans: easier to play 2@D doubles not game sore if make|pg||
nt|psridhar: if defense can find the club ruff-they will get plenty of opportunities for the ruff|pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: Tam wyszli po raz drugi w Kiera. Alew chyba nie dadza rady wypuciæ|pg||
nt|8252: on devrait abdiquer, les @s ont souvent raison|pg||
nt|james_h: 19 imps|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: whoa 2200 ...|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: here after a major 2@S= very dificult to be in a correct contract |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: @S brake nicely |pg||
mb|p|nt|lesh: well looks like over 2@s as well :)|pg||
nt|chick: perhaps with a club finesse to dump a heart, this could make|pg||
nt|snetram:  3 kier forsowaÅo do koÅcÃ³wki, wiÄc pas zaprasza do szlemika|pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: Gdyby @CAs by³ u W, by³by przymus...|pg||
mb|p|nt|ftpe: he will try ruff 2 di at hand|pg||
nt|lesh: the defence has to be careful|pg||
pc|d9|nt|eweber: in board 4 NL managed to win 4 by making 2@d, so 5:4 for them now|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Lebensohl or transfer Lebensohl. Transfer Lebensohl would show both monors|pg||
nt|peachy: even down 1, this be small gain for England|pg||
nt|peachy: and it could slip home|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Which is Jason and which is Justin?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ty|pg||
nt|chick: now very hard to make|pg||
nt|h_karluk: seems clubs hook needed|pg||
nt|snetram:  gdyby chciaÅ graÄ tylko 5 powinien sam licytowaÄ 5|pg||
nt|eamongall: and unfortunately in the not to distant future Eamon Galligans name will be mentioned in Ostend by the Ireland npc .... as I went for 2200 in Brighton as he whispered "donkey" ...|pg||

nt|mcarroll: All one way traffic at the moment|pg||
nt|haans: better :)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yep|pg||
nt|ady: 2 minor suit aces to lose|pg||
nt|shevek: can't score a ruff on top of AK|pg||
nt|lesh: he didnt has the entry ,however the small spade gave it|pg||
nt|h_karluk: then ruff hearts and try devil's coup|pg||
nt|petergill: At least 8 tricks for NS, even on a trump switch|pg||
nt|oleberg: Like Zia says: When you have the @D9, PLAY IT|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: the auction in the other room looks like an interesting twist on leaping michaels - you bid 4 of the minor you haven't got|pg||
nt|athene: that is perhaps sensible if you play the bids as forcing|pg||
nt|bagman: Thx all. I need to go now, see you again.|pg||
nt|bagman: bye|pg||
nt|santyclz: Thanks Pekka.|pg||

nt|shevek: yes|pg||

nt|jameslee 2: 9@D   a not bad play he will make 9 tricks |pg||
nt|oleberg: Yes, the defence has to play something|pg||
pc|d5|nt|athene: it looks at first as though declarer might be able to hold his losers to two trumps from here, if he guesses right, but there's just too much work to do, i suppose|pg||
nt|lesh: well the declarer didnt want to take advantage|pg||
nt|chick: hehe|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|star6ija: 12 tricks may be taken now|pg||
nt|haans: @S7 count even|pg||
nt|bagman: This solves the spade guess as the the @DJ can be used to discard the spade|pg||
pc|hA|nt|paulhac:  This looks like the only lead to give the contract|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Thanks Paul|pg||
nt|paulhac:  We think Justin is East|pg||
nt|haans: all cards from for Austria but no score i believe|pg||
nt|shevek: not if declarer ducks once?|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes he sould still go down|pg||
nt|andreasw:  would*|pg||
nt|justin c: only needs the @SK or the @DK right|pg||
nt|james_h: but the teams fate is sealed I fear|pg||
nt|oleberg: Leading towards the @DK can be done later|pg||
pc|h9|nt|jameslee 2: he can make 4@C+2@H+2@S= 8 tricks  |pg||
pc|h3|nt|ryskiel_: i nast¹pi³o oddanie zapisu i strata|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|ziff:  We can see that the contract is cold, but declarer can see only 8 tricks|pg||
nt|athene: ok, this is just doing his work for him|pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: Graja 3 Dzwonki|pg||
nt|bagman: Anyhow, the non-spade lead indicates the @SA|pg||
mc|11|nt|brolucius: Good point.|pg||

nt|ziff:  I am not surprised....|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: I see that on the rama but no idea on the subject|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: maybe on the slow playing|pg||
nt|tomi2:  yeaterday Nerherlands - Russia was scored as 18-2 VP because of 5 VP for each team|pg||
nt|lmeili: because of slow play?|pg||
nt|tomi2:  yes, as far as I know|pg||
nt|lmeili: that was a heavy penalty!|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: If I have good information they finish 20 minutes late in that match|pg||
nt|tomi2:  10 VP for 20 minutes? thats a lot|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: restarting here|pg||
nt|athene: which means duboin can't have had a count on the diamonds - if he knew declarer had four he would have bashed out that @S10 like a shot|pg||
nt|athene: the standard counter to a 2-suiter being to force declarer|pg||
nt|andreasw:  then a @d to ace and a @s back |pg||

nt|psridhar: might hv worked on some other layout |pg||

nt|h_karluk: 5@c/@d ok|pg||

nt|cumino: May be board 6 is a bit delicate if EST opens 1S|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: israel made 3nt on bd 4 for another game swing|pg||
nt|ady: partial here in spades   Ireland need to keep low|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes may well get too high|pg||
nt|psridhar: Fredin will briefly consider 3nt b4 bidding 4s when he finds out his pd has unbal hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: There was no follow-up to discuss. North jumped to 3@D, South thought it was a WJS and passed|pg||
nt|cumino: 1NT|pg||
mb|1C|nt|Gerben42: apparently the rooms are connected now|pg||
nt|Gerben42: white vs red NS are very agressive, but as we have seen vuln. they are middle of the road|pg||
nt|eweber: 3@s is not exactly what you'd dream of with the South hand...|pg||
nt|Gerben42: best to not dream but pass with a happy face|pg||
nt|eweber: I assume West is the one who is taking his time here|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Great to see the Irish at the top of the leader board|pg||
nt|josj: as far as I know, they were about 30 mins. late and were eventually fined 3 VP each|pg||
nt|tomi2:  getting informed that they got 3 VP back each|pg||
nt|tomi2:  thx|pg||
nt|athene: ok :)|pg||
nt|aldek: England on the board|pg||
nt|andreasw:  @d to king and alot of @s trick's|pg||
nt|shevek: south can only get in once (@dK)|pg||
nt|ftpe: that opening will probably bring them to 6 spades|pg||
nt|xenya: on 7, the Estonian EW in the other room got to 4@H -- not a bad contract really, but down on foul trump split -- 1 down and 7 imps to Russia|pg||
nt|ftpe: in 6 spades he has to guess spade queen, but best chance is playing on sp 2-2|pg||
nt|haans: 10-13|pg||
nt|lechcold: 54 impy w 8 rozdaniach|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: Unfortunate lie of the cards, but will be the same in the other room  one assumes|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hmmm?|pg||
nt|athene: my guess is they put the board on the table upside down|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hand reversed?|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: ty vugragher |pg||
nt|oleberg: Well, if you play Ghana in football, I guess a black squeeze is possible|pg||
mb|1S|nt|boyklas: FG raise with D?|pg||
nt|boyklas: or 14+ Bal?|pg||
nt|haans: that 1@S overcall???|pg||
nt|xenya: i don't think 6@S is such a great contract -- problems in spades and diamonds|pg||
nt|ftpe: agree, but they will get there after ligth open, |pg||
nt|xenya: well the 3@H bid makes it easier to solve the spade problem|pg||

nt|lesh: 1@d has to be alerted I think|pg||

mb|p|nt|rigas_karo: it is safe to bid once again but |pg||
nt|rnmalik: very tempting:)|pg||
nt|mamos: good pressure from South|pg||
nt|othered1: Bye, Udo.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i choose 3@h cue here|pg||
nt|chick: right, 3@C is a better bid|pg||
nt|lechcold: basketball|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: ahh true|pg||
mb|4S|nt|collins64: if Mike bid 4@d, Isabelle 4@h they'll play 6@d|pg||
nt|eweber: if anyone of the players|pg||
nt|yuval10: not everyone's X perhaps|pg||
nt|ady: this might cause Irland to get too high|pg||
nt|jkotor: jak w dobrych juniorskich czasach :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|rigas_karo: 4@d or 4NT?|pg||
nt|roswolf: the boards have been swingy - Italy - slovakia 46-0 after 4 boards shows how|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Vul, not for the fainthearted!|pg||
nt|mamos: at least a couple off|pg||

nt|andersk: cold 4 @H|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 4@H +1|pg||
nt|athene: not sure i like unusual 2nt with 6@D4@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: :)|pg||
nt|athene: partner usually bids clubs with equal length which isn't at all what you want|pg||
nt|athene: notice how south can't bid stayman intending 2@S (sign-off) over 2@D|pg||
nt|athene: they obviously play that as something cunning|pg||
nt|athene: we have seen they have lots of relay auctions after stayman so you do lose the ability to bid it on rubbish hands|pg||
nt|shevek: 8 declarer made 3N and 8 went down|pg||
nt|shevek: declarers|pg||
nt|MolvaM: so it must have been a 50% contract :)|pg||
nt|shevek: true, needs accurate defence|pg||
nt|shevek: lol  murat|pg||
nt|xenya: or... who knows?|pg||
nt|lesh: he has to guess Q@d now, but it is difficult and probably -2|pg||
nt|hawe45:  300 avec le bon flanc - mais tout normale|pg||
nt|mdgraham: understandable auction, but the cards do not lie well|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: Ole I would love to play Ghana tat would mean we are in the final :)|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 2@H = is new for me nice |pg||
nt|oleberg: "To play Ghana" sounds like something that could be illegal (or prohibited to minors)|pg||
mb|p|nt|pitiful:  some play middle encourages and high or low sp in this situation|pg||
nt|shevek: to be fair some went down in 6@d :)|pg||
nt|petergill: Found it http://www.worldbridge1.org/bulletin/06_2%20Piestany/pdf/pairs/bul_04.pdf there are 2 photos of Cecilia. Interesting that the Poles who ran 2nd to them in the 2006 World ...|pg||
nt|petergill: Junior Pairs are near the top of the datums in the Open here in Ostend|pg||
nt|ralfwil: was N opening 1@h? 5+ |pg||
pc|hK|nt|collins64: he made the wrong choice|pg||
nt|boyklas: all the problems comes here for S because he doesnt know the H or the C Quebid|pg||
nt|boyklas: and he make go down even a 5D|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: at least the did well to avoid 6NT :)|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: 5@d by North is safe|pg||
nt|collins64: Belgium is back after the previous deal|pg||
nt|collins64: Dehaye weak NT forced them to play 4@h for one down|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: very weak NT :)|pg||
nt|boyklas: Manolis choosed to play at the 5-3 fit and not at the 4-4, firstly was thinking that he is playing at th 5-4 fit|pg||
nt|collins64: the bidding was 1NT 8-11 Pass 3@c X and he bid 4@h with his 5-card Q@h and his 4-card 8@s|pg||
nt|ady: they might make this  getting 3 diamond tricks|pg||
nt|lesh: A@s and @d switch|pg||
nt|h_karluk: straightforward play also possible|pg||
nt|chick: against the odds to drop the @DQ, but W may lead trump now to protect against a spade ruff|pg||
nt|barnets: Hacketts stopped in 4@S|pg||
nt|bagman: The hands do not fit well|pg||
nt|barnets: after a couple of slam tries|pg||
nt|barnets: on board 6|pg||
nt|brolucius: Countries in certain parts of the globe get a 'free pass' into the Bermuda Bowl. It is much more difficult if you are a European country.|pg||
nt|barnets: Holland have afree pass|pg||
nt|barnets: being the host country|pg||
nt|barnets: next year|pg||
nt|cumino: Good lead here K@H|pg||
pc|hA|nt|dburn: perhaps he should have signalled for a heart|pg||
nt|aldek: and now @DQ|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer is afraid to duck|pg||
pc|hT|nt|collins64: did he actually play the K@h|pg||
nt|boyklas: i dont think so.|pg||
nt|andersk: probably @H 9 lead|pg||
nt|rnmalik: suit worth bidding is worth leading.:)|pg||
nt|haans: most would say "thats not fair"|pg||
nt|davidb: should make on the  D suit |pg||
nt|athene: if north has a pretty good penalty pass here unless he thinks the double is really really offensive|pg||
nt|santyclz: The "DNPA" (does not promise anything) stayman has a lot going for it, but gives up a lot on big hands.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Entame atout - et bonne chance...|pg||
nt|haans: @H to ace to avoid @S ruff|pg||
nt|jkotor: nasi tu 1ba graj¹|pg||
nt|lechcold: 3BA te¿ naci¹gane:) i rezultat bêdzie chyba adekwatny|pg||
nt|bagman: the lead might have been from Kx|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: strange|pg||
nt|andersk: should make now|pg||
nt|paulhac:  And the other room is 2 boards ahead|pg||
nt|andersk: the famous "almost 1k"  +990|pg||
nt|roswolf: i am told gib says the game can make -in practice i am confident it wont|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Sorry - trump lead - and good luck, I meant|pg||
nt|star6ija: 8+points, 5+@hs|pg||
nt|chick: OR, E could make a brilliant overtake of the spades and lead a trump :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: if ther declarer decided to play straightforward that doesn't make a sense|pg||
nt|chick: unfortunately, that gives away the location of the @DQ, so S might just try for the drop now|pg||
nt|h_karluk: *the|pg||
pc|d7|nt|peachy: so even faster there|pg||
nt|ady: problem is the tap with the clubs|pg||
nt|star6ija: :)|pg||
nt|haans: claiming time|pg||
nt|lesh: well East is forced to switch to @d, having or no @d|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: I assumed opener had at least the Q for the 2@h opener - sry :>|pg||
nt|james_h: NS play control responces to 1@c?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mcarroll: Although playing safe after the double 4 is the probable outcome|pg||
nt|psridhar: actually 3nt is superior cont-4s may fail if h ace was wrong|pg||
nt|othered1: Lauria and Versace seem not to have adopted the modern support double.|pg||
nt|snetram:  zauwazcie Å¼e jeszcze dwa rozdanie wcale nie musiaÅy byÄ remisowe. Wtedy by byÅo 80 IMP|pg||
nt|lechcold: du¿a czêæ graczy stosuj¹cych naturalne systemy panicznie boi siê otwierania 1@C/@D na 19PC i masowo naci¹gaj¹ takie rêce do  otwarcia 2BA|pg||
nt|aldek: jak sie trefle nie sa 4-0 a impas pik idzie to duza szansa wygrania|pg||
nt|hawe45:  4 de @S|pg||
nt|8252: moins 1 ou moins 2 suivant les nerfs de Fred à @c|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 9/10 can be made|pg||
nt|odysseus69: surprising to win|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|rnmalik: Possibility only if declarer guesses the entry to W hand.|pg||
nt|athene: Mari shamefacedly trying to shift some diamonds in with his clubs, courtesy of a black pen|pg||
nt|brolucius: Speculative double from East.|pg||
nt|othered1: Their doubles show extras, I believe.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They prefer to use double for something else. One can survive without support doubles you know|pg||
nt|tomi2:  eas has @CAQ in their opened suit, @DA, @SQ and partner made a constructive call vulnerable|pg||
nt|brolucius: Kibitzers suggest lead-directing double (similar to Lightner). But not obvious to me, nor to West.|pg||
nt|lesh: Q@D :)|pg||
nt|james_h: tes they are, confirmed|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This trick is VERY important, North|pg||
nt|othered1: I survive very well without them in almost all partnerships that don't have hours to discuss their ramifications.|pg||
nt|jkotor: 80 to ju¿ blisko mojego juniorskiego rekordu 88-1 w 8 rozd|pg||
nt|justin c: this looks like a good moment to get a drink|pg||
nt|brolucius: In Beijing there were 13 European quarter-finalists out of 16 (in the Open and Women's events) but Europe is given only one quarter of the world championship slots for the Bermuda ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: Bowl and Venice Cup.|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer can make with high cross ruff, if the defense takes the heart ruff|pg||
nt|barnets: that is why the european championships are one of the toughest tests in the whole of bridge|pg||
nt|bagman: Gold thinking how to beat this. There is, however, no way to beat|pg||
nt|odysseus69: and if they dont?|pg||
nt|cumino: 1 more if they don't|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer can discard a heart on the @CA to make 11 tricks with a cross ruff|pg||
pc|s4|nt|yuval10: nice guess by declarer|pg||
nt|davidb: D to the 9 = 10 tricks|pg||
nt|aldek: reka N to jest oczywiste otwarcie 2BA|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 800 theoriquement disponible sur entame trefle|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Petit Chr.|pg||
nt|8252: fo pas exagérer, le 8 de @s stoppe l'hemoragie|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 2nd tie break for Murray|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer was quite safe when he did not discard a heart on @CA in the early play, If he would have misguessed diamonds, the 2nd trump back woul d have leaft him a trick short|pg||
pc|s7|nt|xenya: down 4 if W just cashes his high cards now|pg||
nt|ftpe: wow, 3 he in open room :)|pg||
nt|xenya: he will have to do it sooner or later |pg||
nt|ftpe: + 50 not much when close to 1430|pg||
nt|xenya: well E didn't open there, and that made all the difference |pg||
nt|psridhar: not after the X of course|pg||
nt|haans: yep 3nt a make|pg||

nt|jameslee 2: 9 after the @S finesse |pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|ady: I think can be made playing a diamond to the 9 after Q@S|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes intra finesse position|pg||
nt|pitiful:  still a nice pick up for n-s|pg||
nt|pitiful:  even without the double|pg||
nt|marlowepi: trois fois trefles, as de pique, carreau et pique, un trefle aussi eventuellement au flanc|pg||
nt|bagman: the only way to discard would have been by crossing with a trump|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cJ|nt|athene: still 800|pg||
nt|ftpe: rigth|pg||
nt|xenya: of course, you could argue that EW might have got in later in the auction, but it's easier to say...|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 10@H or 9@H|pg||
pc|cK|nt|hawe45:  But less than 500 will be difficult|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|xenya: by the way, i think the E hand is an opener|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Le retour du 9 de @H Ã¡ la place du Valet aura ete mieux|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mcarroll: Back to +1 after no trump shift|pg||
nt|haans: do not like this |pg||
nt|h_karluk: push next board please|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: coup de grace 9@D|pg||
pc|d8|nt|Walddk2: Be careful Ed, David may have to look that word up too|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer has three minor-suit stoppers to knock out.|pg||
nt|jkotor: czy nie lepiej teraz z pozycji Adama 10?|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|rnmalik: In the OR K@D was led.|pg||
nt|chick: yes but not forced to overtake the @S, that he would do only if a @D lead was needed from E|pg||
nt|lechcold: kwestia limitu...wydaje mi siê, ¿e nawet na brzydkie 20 mo¿na otworzyæ 1 w kolor (o ile 20 mo¿e byæ brzydkie:))|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|davidb: normal finesse..|pg||
nt|james_h: NS happy that SK offside otherwise slam is there|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: scared of a possible heart ruff and possible @c sing with east|pg||
nt|petergill: We put some info about the Swedes on page 2 of this Bulletin two days later http://www.worldbridge1.org/bulletin/06_2%20Piestany/pdf/camp/bul_02.pdf|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jameslee 2: cover to finesse 10@S|pg||
pc|c7|nt|athene: even the "cash all my aces, one by one" defence will be just fine|pg||
nt|brolucius: Can some knowledgeable person put up the web-site address for the current scores?|pg||

nt|ady: only 9 tricks|pg||
nt|davidb: H to K & D to the 9 -normal play|pg||
nt|ady: diamond to the ace and diamond to 9|pg||
nt|bagman: Madala's playing safe for 10 tricks; he should have cashed the @DK as South ruffing it and trump back was practically impossible|pg||

nt|brolucius: Attitude leads against NT, so the low club shows a suit that will be worth pursuing.|pg||
nt|othered1: would south have taken the same line without the double, which pretty strongly put the @CQ offside?.|pg||
nt|lesh: @c switch is not that difficult|pg||
nt|lesh: or playing small :)|pg||

nt|mdgraham: East getting the character of her hand across with 1NT. Not much of a diamond stop, but anything else would be a distortion  |pg||
mb|3C|nt|santyclz: It's particularly unsafe to balance when the opponents haven't shown a fit.|pg||

nt|barnets: west has to avoid leading his long suit V 3N|pg||
nt|brolucius: They are certainly bidding round the houses. Let's hope that they end in the right place.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: eventually 3NT|pg||
mb|3S|nt|rigas_karo: this is not making...|pg||
nt|petergill: Susan Stockdale is very disciplined about taking her time at Trick 1 to study the hand fully before committing herself to any play|pg||
nt|petergill: This is a very good habit to have|pg||
nt|barnets: r he gives dec his 9th trick|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: relays flipping out|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: good bridge by both teams |pg||
nt|justin c: very good contract|pg||

nt|marlowepi: heureusement pour Mari, E peut contribuer la dame de K, sinon entame K serait peu confortable|pg||
nt|brolucius: Obvious what to lead after that bidding...|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk12: It wasn't for the Italians after the same start. Bocchi bid 4@H, 5@D by Madala and 6@H|pg||
nt|barnets: a diamond ?|pg||
nt|cumino: Diamond beats |pg||
nt|bagman: Madala's going to lead a spade and Bocchi's going to play the @SQ|pg||
pc|d6|nt|boyklas: if he had not take the D he would have made it|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: double @C finesse is 75% or so - playing on hearts is 36% 3/3 or 50% abit better if u cash the @HA ... so claerly clubs best line|pg||
nt|odysseus69: need to know what they said about 3S bid|pg||
nt|barnets: wow amazing|pg||
nt|bagman: well done by Madala|pg||
nt|brolucius: Too good.|pg||
nt|bagman: Might 3@S mean solid spade stopper and not so solid diamond stopper?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: I suspect that 3 spades showed good stop|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dQ|nt|haans: :(|pg||
nt|petergill: I lost to Fiona and Susan at the NEC Cup in Japan earlier this year - I know their style quite well|pg||

pc|h2|nt|collins64: other Room 3NT on deal 9|pg||
nt|andersk: maybe South switch small @D|pg||
nt|ziff:  If I understood our operator right he played two cards to the same trick|pg||
nt|MolvaM: maybe ducking would have been better|pg||
nt|barnets: murray won set 2|pg||
nt|brolucius: Perhaps a quicker auction would have given fewer clues.|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|lmeili: do u like N's "double" ? here|pg||
nt|haans: no @D loser|pg||
pc|hK|nt|rigas_karo: i think only 8 tricks even if the ducks the @d|pg||
nt|wygbe1: i need to go, its late here - thx all, gnite, enjoy the match|pg||

nt|peachy: Thanks Jim, enjoyed! G nite|pg||
nt|star6ija: happyend|pg||
nt|brolucius: Will need to look at that one again, Thomas. You are right that he needs to get to the South hand to draw the last trump and a diamond hold-up may be helpful.|pg||
nt|tomi2:  then duck the club later|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 1 set all - murrayv Tsonga|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mcarroll: Surely not|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I mean not playing @SQ?|pg||
nt|haans: Operator Who are the swedish players?|pg||
nt|haans: 2nd opinion: Peacokk: E upmark|pg||
nt|haans: @H5|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|tomi2:  had no other intelligent bid|pg||
pc|d9|nt|boyklas: yes sorry|pg||
pc|dK|nt|paulhac:  Goodnight Jim|pg||
nt|bagman: Now Madala knows how to defend with the setting trick in his own hand|pg||
pc|d7|nt|haans: sloppy|pg||
nt|tomi2:  maybe he can make versace believe @CQ is onside and use spade as entry to hand|pg||
nt|tomi2:  but versace had @CT8, so he could have played the clubs starting with the 8 then without losing communication|pg||
nt|brolucius: Worth another look, you are right. Easier on Deep Finesse.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If S had followed with @hQ on @hK.....|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer still has only 7 tricks ready made|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Pekka I thnk you called it right|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|roswolf: a huge swing on bd6 to ireland when the israelis lost 800 in 5@CX|pg||
nt|ady: board 6 Ireland gain 14 imps    when Israel went down in 4 spades with 2 heart ruffs    the Israel South came in at the 5 level with clubs when Ireland reached 4 spades|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: going for a squeeze - 4@h + the @cK|pg||
nt|barnets: really fine lead by madala --not sure how he worked it out|pg||
pc|c5|nt|cameron_1: good methods so logn as you never want to bid @h|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: is he down ?|pg||
nt|eamongall: down where ? |pg||
nt|james_h: its about an 80% contract|pg||
pc|c9|nt|lmeili: 3N sounds a good contract, needs @d K on side |pg||
nt|bagman: he might try a heart to the 7 for 8th trick|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|boyklas: why not claim?|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: ohh noo nm|pg||
nt|james_h: when clubs 4-1 off side, you can finesse the @h 10|pg||
nt|eamongall: 12 tricks yeah |pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: it turned out to be a decision to pass with north's hand|pg||
nt|Gerben42: perhaps if the operator has time he can enter the missing result|pg||
nt|justin c: more like 90% I imagine|pg||
pc|c3|nt|andersk: btw, I like the 2 Nt bid from Charlie|pg||
nt|rnmalik: With Q@C and P promising 6+@C, good bid.|pg||
nt|andersk: thinking about if he wants to hook the @C?|pg||
nt|petergill: Brilliant idea, Ralf|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cA|nt|justin c: 75 on the @C position alone|pg||

nt|petergill: West cannot get East in|pg||
nt|petergill: North's jamming 4@H call was a good bid, convincing EW not to try 4@S|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed, especially since 4@s would actually make on a heart lead|pg||
nt|petergill: With NS playing a limited opening system (11H 11-16), 4@H might also have been bid on a balanced 14 count, making 4@S by East quite dangerous|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@H 11-16|pg||

nt|marlowepi: un bon contrat|pg||
pc|hA|nt|rnmalik: The contract I mean.|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: that's what I got from thr CR|pg||
nt|athene: if east suspects the 1@H is a psyche he can't be so sure about the diamond finesse|pg||
nt|shevek: I would pass every time|pg||

nt|hawe45:  Carefully played to discard a @H|pg||
nt|cameron_1: are you sure?|pg||
nt|mamos: South holding @HK makes it morelikely that North has @sK   but still needs to finesse 10|pg||
nt|othered1: But NS will  have an exact description of west hand and west will be declarer so @H lead very likely from both sides.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Well done to bid it!|pg||
nt|tomi2:  lauria will lead @HK with his likely trump trick|pg||
pc|sA|nt|pitiful:  that was just to see how many messages I would get :)|pg||

nt|pitiful:  and no I do not play for Spurs|pg||
nt|pitiful:  perhaps I need to put that in my profile|pg||
nt|dburn: his problem is that he thinks (from the opening bid) that North has the ace of clubs|pg||
nt|pitiful:  this is very tough for TT|pg||
nt|pitiful:  DG sorry|pg||
nt|dburn: in which case he needs to cater for the possibility that North will play the fourth round of diamonds|pg||
nt|dburn: so perhaps he will cash hearts, hoping to pitch West's remaining diamond|pg||
nt|dburn: of course, if he had played a low heart to the queen instead of running the jack, as he probably should have done, he would have a quick entry to dummy now|pg||
nt|ftpe: yes|pg||

nt|hawe45:  Claim|pg||
nt|dburn: but he would doubtless have used that to play for North to hold @sKx rather than @sK10x|pg||
nt|lesh: it depends on their methods and the decision of the player. 1NT could be 5@c and 4M, or as here he prefered DBL instead of overcalling 1nt as 15-17|pg||
pc|d7|nt|shevek: flat hand, give it a go, sure pass|pg||
nt|h_karluk: oh that makes sense, thanks|pg||

pc|dT|nt|rnmalik: sorry-11.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: There is no sane player who would insert the 10|pg||
nt|othered1: now west has to  hope that north also holds 4+@D to pitch both @H|pg||
nt|tomi2:  he will try for singleton king of clubs with south maybe ?;)|pg||
nt|brolucius: God is Italian in this room. But he will not be Italian in the other room, if they reach the good slam too.|pg||
nt|tomi2:  god was a German yesterday, that is quite fair :)|pg||

nt|athene: i am not sure where they went wrong but clearly a wheel came off somewhere|pg||
nt|pitiful:  another lead directing bid|pg||
nt|dburn: I suspect the play went quickly at the end - some of those cards were doubltess not played to the same trick|pg||
nt|shevek: I just had a glimpse at the poles playing in 6@d|pg||
nt|shevek: you too :)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  :)|pg||
nt|lesh: I wonder what 1NT is|pg||
nt|chick: 3 suit takeout?|pg||
nt|lesh: I suppose N/S will land at least at 5th level, but then E/W might bid 6@c and then ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: say didn't begin w art 1@c, 3 aces outside, so that's DD slam of EW players, what a homework, ty teacher!|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 11 cards @S for N-S|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: direct 4@S|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: by S|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: EW possibly in trouble now|pg||
nt|xenya: perhaps W was concerned about bad splits in the balck suits and 4-1 @Hs, but all was well|pg||
nt|8252: mais il vaut mieux soit qua ça marche, soit avoir des partenaires compréhensifs et doux|pg||
mb|2H|nt|andersk: Est overcalled 1 @S in open room, and South 2 @S, quite strange bidding, anyway NOrway playing 5 NT in open room|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Looks like 4@H should make|pg||
nt|tomi2:  Wladow knows about partnes @C qualitiy, so he won't lead a club now ;)|pg||
nt|mamos: Gold keeps his 1@D openers up to strength :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 5@C looks difficult with a trump trick and A@S off  and diamonds bottled up|pg||
nt|justin c: did East bid this?|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: unlikely undo ?|pg||

nt|james_h: this might get interesting but I doubt it|pg||
nt|eamongall: ah yeah pass 1@S |pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 11: At the other table, South opened 1NT, West bid 2@C single suiter  and EW never found out what suit it was, so NS ended up in 4@H|pg||
mb|2N|nt|andersk: 2-2|pg||
nt|andersk: no|pg||
nt|andersk: offside|pg||
nt|andersk: incredible match on TV too:)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 6@d may have communication problems.... between parters :)|pg||
nt|lesh: probably 1nt was 3 suits and that's why North decided to pass over 3@d|pg||
nt|lesh: and possible 5@c bid by West now if 1nt is what we suppose to mean|pg||
nt|petergill: something to be said for: calling a spade a spade, perhaps|pg||
nt|ralfwil: close to 6nt|pg||
nt|mdgraham: or even Two Spades|pg||
nt|petergill: yes|pg||
nt|petergill: Susan Stockdale knows that her @DK should be huge, being in partner's suit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: raise to 4NT?|pg||
nt|petergill: I think she will bid 4NT quantitative|pg||
nt|ralfwil: perhaps 4nt from W|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: nice fight by W = 5@C |pg||
nt|oleberg: 5@C is a nice save, -300|pg||
mb|p|nt|lesh: but still it will be very agressive |pg||
mb|3C|nt|eweber: but still, with 210 and 170 on my score card I wouldn't feel to good, it may not cost but surely won't bring in...|pg||
nt|andersk: even more exsiteing then bbo|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT hopless if they lead hearts   |pg||
nt|andreasw:  lol|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: dangerous reopenning here |pg||
nt|psridhar: thin 4s for EW , a lucky make -but imposs to get there unless pushed|pg||
nt|haans: but most of us would|pg||
nt|psridhar: South does have a good hand, cant fault him for reopening|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: what will North try to bid ?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think a similar example was in one of Ian Fleming's 007 JB books|pg||
nt|h_karluk: trappy sample|pg||
nt|lesh: I dont think North will pass|pg||
nt|lesh: South has showed 0-5 and 6+ spades but ...|pg||
nt|chick: N's hand is far too good|pg||
nt|chick: almost slam in hand|pg||
nt|lesh: 4@h is making|pg||
nt|chick: only problem is ... can he overcome his fear of 4-1 or 4-2 trump split in a red suit|pg||
nt|petergill: and then Fiona will probably pass, wanting one more diamond or one more highish card anywhere for 6NT|pg||
nt|ralfwil: With these two guys, you must be fast on the keyboard|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 4@S=620|pg||
nt|oleberg: If he gets diamonds right, which he will.|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 5@C=300 or 500|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulhac:  Putting South to the test|pg||
nt|star6ija: 2@d game forcing|pg||
nt|tomi2:  he is mathematican and we often see him going for overtricks in games where he can go down, when he thinks odds are better than 95%|pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: Pani Agato! |pg||
nt|petergill: Fiona will like @D10, bulking up her long suit|pg||
mb|3D|nt|rigas_karo: maybe he thought declarer hand 6421|pg||
nt|andersk: same lead as open room, probably 11 and a push|pg||
nt|Gerben42: you never know yesterday I saw Greco Hampson making 3N on 11 vs 10|pg||
nt|peachy: somebody took a long time, I assume|pg||
nt|roswolf: looks very possible|pg||
nt|shevek: they had some intervention by west who showed the blacks, still....|pg||
nt|dburn: quite a lot may depend on the lead to 6NT - @c10 (or@c9 depending on methods) will not work well|pg||
nt|dburn: but this is dangerous|pg||
nt|petergill: Ralf, or you will be burned ... am I still allowed to commentate after that?  |pg||
nt|ralfwil: :)|pg||
nt|petergill: 6@C, in case West has 5 clubs|pg||
nt|dburn: although West probably ought to convert to 6NT...|pg||
nt|petergill: A conversion to 6NT would avoid the nasty 5-1 split|pg||
nt|petergill: With 4 clubs, East might have proceeded via "fourth suit forcing"|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: This board.|pg||
nt|peachy: and cant be but South|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes|pg||
nt|8252: il va falloir du bon timing ici|pg||
mb|3H|nt|star6ija: 2N no 3@ss|pg||
nt|psridhar: note that S does not have values like unsupported king or queen sitting under the NT opener-he has a 'pure' hand|pg||
nt|chick: now a XX|pg||
nt|lesh: dangerous call|pg||
nt|chick: "pick another suit"|pg||
nt|lesh: he can even make 5@d|pg||
nt|lesh: 4@h and 5@d making but 3nt not |pg||
nt|chick: he can make 6H if he plays E for something like 4414 or 4405 ... losing 1 heart and no diamonds ... or am I missing something?|pg||
nt|james_h: I like Derek O'Gs raise|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: nice bid West|pg||

nt|roswolf: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/runningscores/asp/roundteamsconditstatclassicmod.asp?qtournid=817&qshowflag=1|pg||
nt|pitiful:  well this is not very interesting|pg||
nt|pitiful:  @c lead best|pg||
nt|lesh: opps 3nt also makes:) He has the entry for @d finess|pg||
nt|lesh: he can but it is impossible to bid|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i whispered he could pass to 3NX but seems was busy a lot and did not hear me|pg||
nt|chick: entry for @D finesse is a problem|pg||
nt|chick: and 6@C EW is makeable too, I think|pg||
nt|lesh: slams are makeable but it is diffucult to reach. |pg||
nt|chick: I dunno, I'd still keep trying to reach a red slam with N's hand|pg||
nt|lesh: from the bidding you know what 4@h are 4-1 at least and there is 4th @d in West|pg||
nt|chick: yes, that's what is scaring N into serious caution|pg||
nt|lesh: your partner is 0-5 points with 6+ spades|pg||
nt|lesh: you dont expect him have K@hxx and 109x in @d|pg||
nt|chick: and nothing wasted in @Ss :)|pg||
nt|aldek: ale konsekwentne|pg||
nt|barnets: yes even 7N makes|pg||
nt|odysseus69: when smoke clears I expect to see 7D|pg||
mb|p|nt|star6ija: still some communication problems|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: problems are arriving for N-S |pg||
nt|psridhar: but 3C x is painful all the same|pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: Przepraszam...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, that's avoided the 5-1 trump break |pg||
nt|dburn: good decision - now all East has to do is make it|pg||
nt|petergill: Good decision by Susan, but can 6NT be made?|pg||
nt|Walddk7: It can|pg||
nt|dburn: North will probably be squeezed in the majors even if East does not pick the clubs|pg||
nt|dburn: but on this auction South is not all that likely to lead the suit|pg||
nt|ralfwil: N is squeezed in majors|pg||
nt|Walddk7: She can get four club tricks by force|pg||
nt|petergill: South has to lead - what? - something ... the hearts and spades lie over West's holdings, reducing squeeze possibilities|pg||
nt|ralfwil: A squeese in more fun than a double finess:)|pg||
nt|Walddk7: If she is inspired and trust that @CJ is a singleton she has four tricks in the suit. The rest will come from diamonds|pg||
nt|petergill: East's 3rd heart might be a vital threat in this hand which even Fiona, usually a fast but careful player, will take a long time to play, surely|pg||
nt|Walddk7: She has just enough entries for all that|pg||
nt|dburn: but if South chooses the queen of hearts (which is dangerous), East may well go astray|pg||
nt|petergill: Sandra Rimstedt can hardly lead a club after this bidding, or will she?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: @HQ is a bit of a Flash Harry sort of lead|pg||
nt|ralfwil: When E can see a 5-card @c and a 4-card @d the squeeze is easy|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: always remember to make actions depending on the vul position |pg||
nt|barnets: and 7@H|pg||
mb|4D|nt|collins64: no Mike show count on J@d lead 7 cards so not possible |pg||
nt|MolvaM: to protect the @cQ and against bad breaks,|pg||
nt|justin c: looks like 5 losers here|pg||
nt|petergill: A low club lead is safe into the expected 4-3 fit - either partner has a bare @C honour or she does not|pg||
nt|Walddk7: That will likely give the show away|pg||
nt|dburn: well, that's a safe club to lead - declarer probably won't take four club tricks now|pg||
nt|petergill: NS lead 3rd and 5th versus both NT and suit|pg||
nt|Walddk7: I think she will, they lead 5th|pg||
nt|Walddk7: That's what I meant by giving the show away|pg||
nt|dburn: yes, but they also lead third - it would be a little vexing to lose to @cJ109 or the like with North|pg||
nt|petergill: A club lead from a 3 or 4 card holding is unlikely (being risky, might pick up partner's queen) on the bidding|pg||
nt|dburn: well, declarer lost her way at the other table, so this is a big chance for Fiona Brown|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: here is ths most advantaje Vulnerable position for a pair Non Vul - Vul = we are clear advantaje never hesitate to fight 1 more |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: remember te only bad safe is when you are getting paid 1 don and you decided to defend |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 1 down |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: as you can see West has no key cards to fight againtx 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: got of to a bad lead    but still defence can recover  South will need to play a low heart when in with A@S   and north will have to read the position|pg||
nt|star6ija: decided by the defense|pg||
nt|andreasw:  Magnusson in control here and chose 6@h|pg||
nt|tomi2:  if he exited with a heart, Versace could have won the Jack and give partner a @D ruff to "get back" the 2 imps Kirmse was working for, but we don't know the cards exactly|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: so good 5@C|pg||
mb|4H|nt|roswolf: the lead was i think another sols flight of fancy|pg||
nt|shevek: good choice|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes had Mag bid a cue Harald would bid 6@d and Mag had to make a choise|pg||
nt|andreasw:  after 4nt from harald ofcourse|pg||
nt|MolvaM: spade lead?|pg||
nt|andreasw:  small @h lead but could cost the beating trick|pg||
nt|MolvaM: and then another spade (when in with @hA) could create problems|pg||
nt|andreasw:  i would lead the @c|pg||
nt|MolvaM: declarer must refrain from cashing diamonds|pg||
nt|lesh: opps|pg||
nt|chick: N did well not to double :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: okay, if the input is correct now i belived much to that old saying in BG. "The wolf has a thick neck, because he does his job on his own. "|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: :)|pg||

nt|ralfwil: But there is also a double squeeze if S has only a 4-card @d, so correctplay is to win on dummy, and play on @d|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is East who should be able to count 13 tricks at the end.|pg||
nt|bagman: 7@H is easy to play, win the first trick and play @HA and heart to the T|pg||
nt|bagman: How would you play 7NT?|pg||
nt|bagman: I would go for double squeeze|pg||
mb|d|nt|odysseus69: slowly|pg||
mb|r|nt|collins64: !2 on dummy singleton 3@d for declarer and Mike played 4@d and discard 5@d|pg||
nt|collins64: 2@d|pg||
nt|boyklas: belgium plays 3NT at the OR|pg||
nt|boyklas: in board 11|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: played by east i guess.. should make|pg||
nt|boyklas: no by west, its one down at least|pg||
nt|Gerben42: Rudakov getting out for -1|pg||
nt|eweber: the open just finished board 8, 4s -1, so 10 imps for Russia|pg||
nt|eweber: sorry|pg||
nt|eweber: for NL|pg||
nt|pitiful:  looks like 9 tricks |pg||
nt|psridhar: Fredin may get his 800 'back' !|pg||
nt|petergill: Lucky it's not me who is declarer, I would take forever... . and I mean "forever" ... to play this hand|pg||
nt|bagman: with spades as the pivot suit|pg||
mb|p|nt|jameslee 2: we can see in trick 1 how East encorouge with 2@S |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: many players still  have not change to a small card to say your parner we want that suit again |pg||
nt|psridhar: defense shd try to avoid the trump endplay|pg||
nt|ralfwil: sry 3-card @d|pg||
mb|4N|nt|Walddk12: Welcome to Vasillis Virvidakis|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulhac:  Playing for England on BBO at the moment|pg||
nt|vasmar: Good morning all|pg||
nt|roswolf: solo|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: for bridge players there are a lot of modern calls / bids / discards /bridge is evolution as all sports |pg||
mb|5C|nt|star6ija: @h to the queen and home|pg||
nt|xenya: in the other room EW got to an inferior 4@S contract, which, however, had ther advantage of being makeable|pg||
nt|haans: here Fredin does not have a clue what E have|pg||
nt|barnets: on board 10 Justin H led a @S so expected swing for Italy|pg||
nt|cumino: 4NT = 2Key|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2:  wladow will need to set up an extra @D trick now|pg||
nt|haans: South needed @CT and @C lead to bid more|pg||
nt|h_karluk: true, world soccer championship also exciting for many nations|pg||
nt|shevek: duck again|pg||
nt|MolvaM: now take @hA and push another @s|pg||
nt|james_h: Derek is getting tired I think|pg||
mb|5H|nt|lmeili: !J |pg||
nt|ady: now home    a likely swing for Israel|pg||
nt|ftpe: yes, a little lucky|pg||
nt|haans: really not bad|pg||
nt|haans: draw clubs and then spades = 3 spade tricks|pg||
nt|psridhar: Try as he might i dont see Herbst avoiding the 800|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: terry taking no chances ...|pg||
nt|james_h: but there are not many who do not|pg||
nt|petergill: She will pitch a spade and a heart from dummy on the @d's, to retain squeeze chances|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2:  @DJ would be best|pg||
nt|tomi2:  wd|pg||
nt|ralfwil: well played and discard @h on @d|pg||
mb|7D|nt|pitiful:  4 more imps on board 11|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Now she regreats that she did not win the lead in hand, but she can still make it if she reads it|pg||
mb|p|nt|psridhar: a small measure of revenge for the swedes as this 800 is against their 2s ! ( in contrast to the Israeli colln which was against their game ) :)|pg||
nt|Walddk7: regrets  even|pg||
mb|p|nt|8252: correct|pg||
nt|brolucius: This is like a long arrow, heading straight for the bulls-eye.|pg||
mb|p|nt|eamongall: I think its time to hit the road back to swords ...if they play slow I will be home in time for the wake |pg||
nt|brolucius: Got there!|pg||
pc|s6|nt|boyklas: by east sorry, he fillipos led small H manolis took the A and played a small D taking the A from the dummy so -1|pg||
nt|MolvaM: no problem|pg||
nt|MolvaM: dummy has a high heart|pg||
nt|andreasw:  still makeable|pg||
nt|psridhar: now 1100 even|pg||
nt|tomi2:  Smirnov Piekarek found some great defense against 3NT in board 10|pg||
nt|bagman: 7@D is more a bidding problem than a play problem. With trumps breaking it's easy to take a heart ruff|pg||
nt|cumino: Spade lead board 10 in 3NT|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Gerben42: also an option to pass 1@H, then reaching 3/4@H is likely|pg||
nt|andreasw:  but a nice try|pg||
nt|petergill: When North showed out in clubs, Fiona will smartly think about North having length in both majors and being squeezable|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Which is a certainty when she cashes @D10|pg||
nt|mdgraham: from the photos, I'd say that both North and South are - no, I'd better not |pg||
pc|sT|nt|pitiful:  the Dutch stopped in 2@s and the twins competed to 3@c which was mercifully not doubled down 2|pg||
nt|eamongall: 13.5 miles |pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: well defended|pg||
pc|d2|nt|Gerben42: going down|pg||
nt|petergill: NS play upside down count, so Fiona is thinking that South has 4 @Ds and 5 @Cs|pg||
pc|d4|nt|collins64: Greece is back after deal 11|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: yes match can get close to a draw situation after hand nº 12 & 8 boards to play|pg||
nt|petergill: and not many major suit cards|pg||
nt|ralfwil: back on @sK|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Or cash @CK, then a heart|pg||
nt|petergill: If South is 3-1 in the majors, the timing to allow for both single and double squeeze possibilities is worth thinking about|pg||
nt|petergill: What to pitch from fummy on @d's is part of the problem|pg||
nt|petergill: @HQJ could be doubleton|pg||
nt|petergill: @S6 3rd and 5th - count-givers to the end|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @cK and a @s to @sk, @d10 and all is clear|pg||
nt|Walddk7: If Peter had been declarer, he would probably not have played to trick 1 yet|pg||
nt|petergill: Sandra Rimstedt and Emma Sjoberg play pro bridge at US Nationals, and do quite well there|pg||
nt|petergill: Roland is right|pg||
pc|dK|nt|odysseus69: the only question was how many bids it would take- actually I believe that many grnd slams are easier to bid than most small slams|pg||
nt|cumino: claim|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|ralfwil: WD!|pg||
nt|barnets: match close now|pg||
mc|13|nt|Gerben42: so 100 is fine for NL|pg||
nt|pitiful:  declarer is possibly concerned that east has five @c's|pg||
nt|petergill: Nevena Senior found a good @H swtich at the other table, and then declarer chose to pitch a spade (not a club) from dummy, hoping for a @H and @c squeeze which did not eventuate|pg||

nt|MolvaM: a normal weak 2?|pg||
nt|andreasw:  in my book it would be to strong for a weak bid|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, the boards in this set haven't been overly exciting so far|pg||
nt|ftpe: 2 diamond multi i guess, hard with only 5-carder and minimum|pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: Jansma próbuje: 4BA|pg||
nt|petergill: Susan has become a perfect partner, who will not say a word|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: On the other hand, that was an awfully quacky hand, even with 15 "Pearson Points" (hcp + number of @ss.)|pg||

nt|jameslee 2: other room playing in hand nº 12 just 2@S  (no reopening call ther by South ) |pg||

nt|haans: 1@S to show 2 3 spade no extra|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2@C was forcing to game, so I suppose a 2@S continuation covers all the spade raises.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@H over 2@H would be a @H raise and @D shortness|pg||
nt|othered1: and with no side shortness?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Let me ask giammi|pg||
nt|8252: sans les @s, on a du mal aussi|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: 2 off for sure|pg||
nt|barnets: anyone see a twelfth trick in hearts ?|pg||
nt|brolucius: East known to have long clubs, so Townsend is suspicious of the @S8 switch and declines the finesse.|pg||

pc|cK|nt|Gerben42: now at least 2|pg||

nt|jameslee 2: 15/1 up|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 4- is not a part score not much dange on this x|pg||
nt|oleberg: Or at least the double shows, that diamonds is controlled, and south should be vary, leading from honours|pg||
nt|ralfwil: this lead makes that N can win the @d immediately and return another @s|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: tricks count |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: East |pg||
nt|oleberg: 3@D must have been invitational, so the double is "safe"|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 3@S+2@H+1@C=7 |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: he needs to develope the @D |pg||
nt|ralfwil: only 6 tricks from top, so let us see|pg||
nt|oleberg: the lead is a killer|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: sorry 6 yes |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: remember siesta time for Spanish people |pg||
nt|oleberg: This will always take at least 7 tricks, 6 obvious ones, and seventh cannot help but being devellopped|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: Siesta= good life in spain / relax moment and here we are fighting in this match :)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|pitiful:  safe play by declarer|pg||
nt|mamos: making safe|pg||
nt|pitiful:  leaving trump in dummy to ruff @s|pg||

nt|Walddk2: So they go through 2NT with a balanced heart raise|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|boyklas: 5C at boar 12|pg||

nt|pitiful:  i saw symonds play the other night for Surrey|pg||
pc|hA|nt|haans: do not understand low spade|pg||
nt|Walddk7: At TGR they would probably play this in 3NT in order collect 150 honours|pg||
nt|petergill: This gives declarer an entry to dummy for the doomed trump finesse|pg||
pc|c5|nt|boyklas: boar|pg||
nt|shevek: I think it also suggests shortage in @h|pg||
nt|chick: can make 6, but I predict only 5 ... will set up @Ds, they will knock out the other @S stopper, and he won't dare take the @H finesse|pg||
nt|petergill: Declarer has to misguess a lot in order to fail|pg||

pc|h3|pg||
nt|peachy: 3Nt was better since hearts 4-4, but one never knows|pg||

nt|jameslee 2: 9@D a very strong card in N|pg||
pc|c3|nt|Gerben42: thanks to the 3@S opener|pg||
nt|bagman: The defense can get 800 if they make no mistake. Often a trick is dropped|pg||
nt|bagman: and declarer escapes with -500|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|boyklas: Dehaye didnt find the S lead so again some imps for greece|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 8 tricks|pg||
nt|petergill: Their system wrongsided the hand - "calling a spade a spade" works a bit better on this hand|pg||

nt|brolucius: If this sort of deal appears in a problem book (where you are meant to see if you can deal with bad breaks in hearts and/or clubs), I usually turn the page to see the answer ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: straight away. I suppose - somewhere in the  universe - there is a hard-working bridge player who spends ages trying to work out the answers to such problems.|pg||

pc|d9|nt|dburn: careful play, that @sQ, just in case West was doing something fiendish|pg||

pc|d3|pg||
pc|h8|pc|c9|pc|hT|nt|oleberg: East's strenght, (and placement of highcards) is unknown, so the defence goes for the sure set, happy to defeat a contract, that might have made if not for the double|pg||

nt|vasmar: double now|pg||
nt|ady: played a diamond to the 9 early on to make 4@S on board 9|pg||

nt|peachy: as it is, 12 tricks|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Unless he takes a diamond finesse|pg||
nt|peachy: if they duck club, it will be testy|pg||
nt|brolucius: If yo use 12-14 and 15-17 as your ranges for 1NT and the 1NT rebid, a jump rebid of 2NT shows 18-19. They must do something different since West has only 17 here.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Hardly worth an upgrade, with those intermediates, it would seem.|pg||
nt|tomi2:  @S2 gives you the count of the spades, they should behave 4-4|pg||
nt|othered1: Giving an extra Work point or two when  you have only aces and kings is reasaonable, perhaps mandatory|pg||

nt|petergill: Even if you play Simple Stayman, responding 3@H or 3@S with a max with a 5 card suit to simple Stayman is a pretty good idea IMO, rarely costs|pg||

nt|jameslee 2: time for a good think by east |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: A@S or not ?|pg||

nt|jameslee 2: so defence needs to put J@S|pg||
nt|oleberg: There is always a heart-loser|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: true there is a 9@H problem there good point by specs|pg||

pc|c5|pc|cA|nt|snetram:  tu moÅ¼e byc bez jednej|pg||

nt|Gerben42: 13 tops now |pg||
nt|petergill: With 9 trumps, you play for the drop, and with 8 trumps you finesse the queen, unless the bidding and/or play suggests otherwise |pg||
nt|oleberg: It is always 11 (thx kibz) |pg||
pc|h8|nt|dburn: for example, Brink may not believe he can give Drijver a spade ruff, because that would mean East's bidding is completely berserk|pg||
nt|pitiful:  surely not Ace|pg||

nt|justin c: guess 2@H showed @H and minor|pg||
nt|barnets: did not locate their @D fit|pg||
pc|c6|nt|vugraphzng: There are information that on board 9, it was not put in the right direction in the other room, expect modification|pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: Tewraz mo¿e wzi¹æ nawet 13 lew|pg||
nt|me argent: apres moi il devait dire quelque chose ou risque manquer un manche vul|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: Its easy to be critical of players on BBO but you have to recall we can see all the cards and these guys are on day 7 now of tough bridge that takes some stamina|pg||
nt|jaapfr: successfull 1nt bid although @S 432 not a sensational @S holding:)|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: or |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 1Nt = -1|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: dependes on defence |pg||
nt|ralfwil: not on a @c return|pg||
nt|barnets: after west opened 1N|pg||
nt|odysseus69: all the other matches are close except Iceland at moment heading for 20-10 v Netherlands|pg||
pc|cA|nt|rnmalik: Routine.|pg||
nt|motu: 5@D= @DK|pg||
nt|lmeili: so he has no @h k?|pg||
nt|tomi2:  @H8 lead vs slam would work nicely, if you have "top of nothing" on your card :)|pg||
nt|ady: now may make an overtrick|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: anoter part score hand |pg||
nt|psridhar: Fredin is quite active making 3 bids ( so far) on his aceless minimum|pg||
nt|psridhar: EW were better off defending 2c i thk|pg||
nt|psridhar: bd 15 sweden passed out 1H -may be a swing for Israel|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|collins64: what's 2NT|pg||
nt|roswolf: well this seems to be very good for ireland|pg||
nt|ftpe: even poor lead, will go down|pg||
nt|xenya: think he can make?|pg||
nt|ftpe: no way|pg||
nt|xenya: we will see|pg||
nt|xenya: it feels there must be a way|pg||

pc|c9|nt|shevek: 14-16|pg||
pc|c2|nt|rigas_karo: 5 top tricks for the defence|pg||
nt|motu: 5@D says nothing about other kings but East is limited to 14 so another K is not possible|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: nice lead from North we must say so |pg||
nt|odysseus69: 2 service breaks for Murray in 3rd set|pg||
pc|c7|nt|boyklas: 16-18 Balanced|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Trump split painful for declarer|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You can have 1NT as a transfer to 2@C|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am told: Duboin makes 3NT on 14. gets @s2 and shoots a @s straight back! When nobody wants to cash out the spades, he ducks a club.|pg||
nt|tomi2:  In poland 99.9 % play non forcing, in Germany we have lots of influences in bidding and defense, some from French bidding style, some from American books and some from Polish players, because some German players are Polish origin, like Piekarek |pg||
nt|ryskiel_: i wemie|pg||

nt|ady: dont think east's pass wrong    has already shown values with 2NT|pg||
nt|ady: north sure to get diamonds right|pg||
nt|roswolf: west might/should have bid 4@H but i would have done more as east on this auction|pg||
nt|psridhar: whatever their methods were , this 2nt is not pretty on club lead|pg||
nt|psridhar: i fancy -200|pg||
pc|h5|nt|shevek: no they play mini NT not vul (10-12)|pg||
nt|tomi2:  in the OR, so you see some pairs playing SEF based style, some 2/1 and some use polish club and polish style bids and carding|pg||
nt|8252: il protège les @c en duquant, et espère l'AS d'atout an Nord, ou un gisement des @s favorable|pg||
nt|bagman: This lead was quite helpful for the declarer. With the cards being nice it did not matter much, however|pg||
pc|h3|nt|paulg:  at least he can pitch a heart on the fourth spade|pg||
nt|hawe45:  120 - next|pg||
nt|shevek: http://tinyurl.com/29ud57z|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|collins64: A@c for the 10@c|pg||
nt|pitiful:  probably watching the cricket with Roland...|pg||
nt|pitiful:  looks like 9 tricks here|pg||
nt|xenya: now 2 hearts pitching 2 diamonds -- that must be his plan?|pg||
nt|ftpe: he probably knows cl 3-3, so maybe will play on clubs|pg||
nt|xenya: but that would lead to a defeat i think -- discarding diamonds i mean|pg||
nt|xenya: and trying to ruff a @D loser in the dimmy|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|haans: many plax xx as forcing to at lead 2nt|pg||
nt|brolucius: It will be interesting to see how many pairs reach 7@D. Perhaps a majority at this level.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: now David did you say you wanted to be kept up to date with cricket?|pg||
pc|h6|nt|collins64: and @s|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: creative bidding would  be my guess:)|pg||
nt|paulg:  although not an ideal start to a doubled four-level contract|pg||
nt|haans: just to tease|pg||
pc|h7|nt|vasmar: club was not a success|pg||
nt|star6ija: 3rd trump trick apeared|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|ziff:  Of course he didn t lead @H8 as he had no idea where @HA is, but it would sure have been fun :)|pg||
nt|psridhar: S will duck dia queen to cut declarer off his hand|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 23/19 getting closer te match |pg||
nt|psridhar: perhpas Fallenius might hv tried 2S over Fredin's 2D- a much better spot than 2nt|pg||
nt|haans: so fredin just had to countinue bidding|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 2nt a contract you bid but you never play|pg||
nt|psridhar: Israel are in 2H other room as EW|pg||
nt|psridhar: Denmark leading 51-7 vs Estonia after bd 16|pg||

nt|justin c: i have to go - enjoy the rest of the match all|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: Ireland started really well and this squad beat the team silver in the trials ... its a learning curve and one which will stand to them ... |pg||
pc|hJ|nt|rigas_karo: same|pg||
nt|xenya: in the OR, the lead was a safe a heart |pg||
nt|psridhar: Russia up 4--15 vs Ireland with one bd to go|pg||
nt|marlowepi: mieux|pg||
nt|me argent: mais avec les 2K noir mal places il va chuter|pg||
nt|ritong: il est tres probable que l autre salle atteindra aussi ce tres bon contrat|pg||
nt|bernix: .|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: needs to refrain from ruffing here make declarers life abit harder|pg||
pc|hA|nt|vasmar: there may be a club spade squeeze|pg||
nt|psridhar: 40-15|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|paulg:  bidding 4@c would have given someone the option of running if doubled (although never easy to work out when to run) ... 4@d has no such safety valve|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Could easily play East for KQ@C doubleton and go for 800|pg||
nt|xenya: well now he MUST discard diamonds on the hearts |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: big smash there fron denmark |pg||
nt|odysseus69: I hear that Hacketts bid 6NT|pg||
nt|bagman: declarer is still going to lose a spade and a diamond|pg||
mc|10|nt|pitiful:  didn't cash their @s|pg||
nt|tomi2:  as predicted Italy won 3NT over there, dubion exited with a spade and had tempo to try the clubs because he knew the @S split|pg||

nt|santyclz: Not in @ds.  A good sign.|pg||

mb|3N|nt|andersk: Not any boards from live page updated from this match, yet. I have a feeling 2 boards are misscoored, for +3 IMP to Croatia|pg||
nt|rnmalik: would require good play to make this contract.|pg||
nt|paulg:  As well as starting much later on Saturday, you'll only have 16 board matches in the Seniors|pg||
nt|brolucius: Perhaps you are not English?|pg||
nt|barnets: is 100 a good score at cricket ?|pg||
nt|bagman: maybe that's the explanation|pg||
nt|brolucius: We don't watch javelin throwing on TV, like you do!|pg||

nt|vasmar: another 2 imos in board 15 for germany|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 1@H = 4 card @S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In the finals the 9 teams from one group will play against the 9 from the other group and an aggregate score is calculated|pg||
nt|tomi2:  Italy and Iceland have quite confortable leads, they can try to relax in matches agains teams, that will be relegated for sure and save some energy and avoid time penalties (don't know if penalties are also carried into 2nd RR)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Six teams will qualify for the Bermuda Bowl - the top six in the second round-robin. At the moment the field is split into two, so around the top 3 in each section may be seen as ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: the top contenders at present. But there is some luck involved in which of your scores are dropped after the first round-robin.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Penalties are carried forward if both teams qualify, not if only one of them|pg||
nt|chick: with the diamond finesse working and a good guess in clubs, he can make 6|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: he has 3@D +3@C+2@S= 8 tricks |pg||

nt|jameslee 2: 4@S= 10 tricks |pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's stated in the bulletins|pg||
nt|odysseus69: te he Italian philosophy is to bid all suits where there is possible weakness - most Brits would simply bid 3NT after Stayman|pg||
nt|barnets: hacketts stopped in 4@H so we dont get to see if they can make it|pg||
nt|barnets: they led a diamond so prob just as well they stopped|pg||
nt|barnets: @D is tthe best lead for defense|pg||
pc|sA|nt|santyclz: N might have been contemplating a @h raise there.|pg||
nt|xenya: seems any reasonable line will succeed here|pg||
nt|james_h: Good show, now make it :)|pg||

nt|eweber: many diamonds with NE here|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer might take the club finesse now|pg||
nt|odysseus69: going to lose club to bare q maybe- however he does not have entries if North has qxxx so maybe not|pg||
pc|c4|nt|Gerben42: this will somehow make I gues|pg||
nt|Gerben42: even though only 8 tricks are clear, all those 10 will trouble EW|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: this looks makeable - whats the best way to handle diamonds ?  guess @dA and ruff one ... |pg||
nt|petergill: South played the opening bidder for @HQ on the last hand in order to make up her 12 HCP for her opening bid - surely?|pg||
pc|c5|nt|vasmar: but now she has to find diamonds|pg||
nt|andreasw:  im hopefully not:)|pg||
nt|ftpe: sotuh knows that north has 0 points|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am told that Netherlands qill qualify for BB as hosts. So there may be 6 more Euro qualifiers, making 7 in all.|pg||
nt|petergill: that's why it was 120|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but a finesse could not lose imo|pg||

nt|kdr_fm: 2@d looks like @h's or @s & a minor|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@C cue denies spade control|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@H might deter West|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@H denies @DA. |pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|rigas_karo: with a @h lead, the paly will be very fast...|pg||
nt|motu: i guess he can find the @D position|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @D-shift from North looks needed|pg||
nt|athene: the defence have to lead diamonds at some point|pg||
nt|athene: before declarer gets the clubs going and throws two diamonds on spade and the last club|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Good pass by Magnusson|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A Zia double. "Try to double every time you have the queen in their suit; they will then play your partner for it"|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Oh, I am asked to tell what the USA1 team is. I will, of course|pg||
nt|snetram:  trudno uwierzyc w licytacje|pg||
nt|eamongall: is there a repechage event in this competition or do the losers just go home and play golf |pg||
nt|bernix: keeping @sK in dummy, just in case he needs a 2nd ruff|pg||
nt|dburn: well judged|pg||
nt|petergill: West needs perfect cards for slam - Axx, AQxx, xxx, Qxx - so she wisely passes  |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: declarer not with many tricks looks an imposible contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|eweber: a festival for the weak NT players who find their @s fit :)|pg||
nt|athene: not at all easy for north to lead from Qxx round to Jxx though|pg||
nt|haans: He asked and got NO|pg||
nt|pitiful:  this is a nice spot for e-w|pg||
nt|ftpe: 3 nt was hard bid|pg||
nt|xenya: normal to bid 3N on 25 points, but the game is very thin|pg||
nt|ftpe: punish will come, even if lucky lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Fleisher-Kamil, Weinstein-Levin, Stansby-Martel|pg||
nt|tomi2:  I am not a fan of redoubles with hands that have only one thing to say... "I have support and some values". Redouble for me should mean "I want to double the opps" but it is so unlikely for W that he will get opps...|pg||
nt|brolucius: If you play negative bids over a double, you need to use redouble more - I guess.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Funnily enough this is all about @HQ, is it now?|pg||
nt|othered1: I prefer redouble denies fit, unless game force.|pg||
nt|tomi2:  more often opps will preempt you in spades and partner will not know about your fit when its his turn to bid. You should have a bid in your system to show a constructive or invitational raise directly|pg||
nt|tomi2:  best again is to use transfers :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: transfers are useful in many sequences but no-one ever seems to write a magazine article about them. (Must prefer to keep the advantages to themselves...)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Gromöller is a hot favourite to go down. He must lose two spades and one diamond, and why would he play South for @HQ after the take-out double?|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ritong: rumen va d abord essayer de faire tomber le @d V|pg||
nt|odysseus69: are tese the cards they are bidding?|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3NT would have had a better chance. The cards lie quite well.|pg||
nt|barnets: why not?|pg||
nt|barnets: 3@H invite with hearts|pg||
nt|barnets: 3@S is forcing|pg||
nt|barnets: 3N lets try it|pg||
pc|c5|nt|rnmalik: and thought well:)|pg||
nt|tomi2:  my gues is: his intention was "pd pls bid 3nt with a spade stopper"|pg||
nt|athene: it could easily give tricks away|pg||
nt|athene: i assume that @D4 is the @H4|pg||
nt|hawe45:  East found the shift|pg||
nt|andreasw:  if denmark wins now free beer for all|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: good question Eamon - most events have a final B with the top x teams allowed back in ... not sure|pg||
pc|cK|nt|xenya: N was sort of endplayed on the lead -- any suit he might lead (except @Cs) gives away a trick|pg||
nt|psridhar: are they saving vul vs nv on a 4-4? looks 500 to me|pg||
nt|bernix: there is a transnational. i'd prefer golf|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|paulg:  12 tricks looks a lot at the other table|pg||
nt|haans: play clubs at sonest|pg||
nt|haans: soonest|pg||
nt|vasmar: i think that in hearts there are a lot of tricks for N-S|pg||
nt|pitiful:  should make 10 on the layout|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: after @H North will be told where to go after with a signal|pg||
nt|barnets: 4@H I have a good card in your suit|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3@H looks like a bit of a punt on that suit, when vulnerable. Why not 1NT? Jump shifts are invitational.|pg||
nt|cumino: 3NT was a good feeling by Gold|pg||
nt|odysseus69: over 1s- with Axxxxx- dont please tell me this is the way to bid in 2010- it wont catch on in our street|pg||
nt|barnets: agree better to have the  @H10 in north|pg||
nt|brolucius: And the @HJ. |pg||
pc|h6|nt|santyclz: @c back looks safer than @d.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Still tempting though|pg||
nt|shevek: coffee hand is when you need to go to the bathroom and pretend you go to the kitchen :)|pg||
nt|chick: in any case, EW found a makeable game|pg||
nt|chick: won't be easy with the awful trump split, but he has a lot of resources outside of trump|pg||
nt|me argent: tout marche pour lui|pg||
pc|h3|nt|haans: true always is|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: good 4@S if -1 =200 for a 420 opps |pg||
nt|ritong: si ça ne marche pas, il lui restera la solution des @ss|pg||
nt|8252: oui, mais bon coloris, à SA, -10 au lieu de - 11 :)|pg||
nt|ritong: mais ça marchera|pg||
pc|h2|nt|paulhac:  Looks like 12 on this lead also|pg||
nt|vasmar: now 1NT will go 1 off probably|pg||
nt|vasmar: 4 hearts + 3 Aces|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: but seems a 500 againtx a 420|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|mcarroll: not enough dummy entries to trap @HK so will lose 2@D,1@S and the @HK|pg||
nt|haans: sweden DOWN|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3@D should be gf and if so west could have bid 3@S when a slam would be reached|pg||
nt|lechcold: do taryfy chyba brakuje 2 Impów?|pg||
nt|petergill: There are far more hands where 5@H goes down than ones where 6@h makes, excellent judgement by Stockdale|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: I think he will discard a @C|pg||
nt|brolucius: It's a Young Chelsea bid.|pg||
nt|bagman: If N has what he's supposed to have, S might have passed|pg||
nt|barnets: @HA109854|pg||
nt|barnets: the !J makes it a strong jump shift|pg||
nt|barnets: kidding|pg||
pc|sK|nt|athene: declarer really played a diamond, not a trump, at trick 2?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Doesn't seems likely.|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 2@C = mean = @D |pg||
pc|sA|nt|rnmalik: Cant play @S that would squeeze the hand.|pg||
pc|s4|nt|eweber: ... or play 1@c|pg||
nt|lmeili: wd!|pg||
nt|MolvaM: coffee hands are the type of hands that allow you to go and get a cup of coffee from the kitchen without worrying about what extremely clever remark you can do here as commentator|pg||
nt|tomi2:  he knows now @DQ in north, so not many points left for south. maybe some bad clue, but better than no clue ;)|pg||
nt|othered1: north might have ruffed to play @S through, at possible cost of trump trick|pg||
nt|tomi2:  I am told that the systematic meaning of xx is "10+, often no @H fit", hmm|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Club exit won't help declarer|pg||
nt|brolucius: Clever line of play.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: North rates to have more hearts than South after the double, so it would be against the odds to finesse through South|pg||
nt|brolucius: More important to have your hand in the bulletin than to actually win the match.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Versace could easily have had @CQ instead of @HQ|pg||
nt|tomi2:  spades should be 4-4|pg||
nt|othered1: Whne I play @DK from dummy, south's lead was from J10xx|pg||
nt|tomi2:  dias are 2north and 3 south|pg||
nt|lechcold: kto by siê tego spodziewa³? du¿a, przyjemna niespodzianka|pg||
nt|eamongall: but wait ...at first glance greece have 3 plus scores on 18-20 ...there might be some singing yet in austria |pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Gerben42: 1@C is forcing for me :)|pg||
nt|eweber: for those who don't know, Gerben preferably plays Fantunes|pg||
nt|tomi2:  so if clubs are 4-4, north has longer hearts, if 5-3 south has longer hearts|pg||
nt|barnets: probably north could not invite going thru 1N|pg||
nt|cumino: He can survive|pg||
nt|brolucius: I can't see that 3@H is any sort of disciplined bid. I am rather disappointed by it. |pg||
pc|c6|nt|haans: and he should have|pg||
nt|andreasw:  for me it's smooking hand:)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  smoking|pg||
nt|ftpe: 1 nt opening showing 15-17, having 8 as prd, pass is rigth i think, max. is 25 and 8 had no extra|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|tomi2:  and having 4 spades is enough for an Italian player to double, can't remember an Italian TO double on 4144 :)|pg||
nt|barnets: so had to make a choice of the lesser of 2 evils|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|cumino: sry private|pg||
nt|barnets: if he bids 1N what is his next bid over 2@C or 2@D ?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: this style has 0(zero) (zilch) appeal to e- what happens when pd has 5 clubs facing your Axxx - we can find out on the way back to the hotel|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Murray 2 sets to 1 and at the Oval.....|pg||
nt|odysseus69: break for Murray in 4th|pg||
nt|brolucius: All two-over-one players would have to respond 1NT and then make some bid or other in hearts.|pg||
nt|barnets: and if you cant make an invitational bid in hearts by jumping to 3@H then maybe you should make a direct invite|pg||
pc|c7|pc|h7|nt|roswolf: i think west was a bit lazy here|pg||
nt|eamongall: this one looks like an EW score so no hope there |pg||
nt|barnets: in the old days before 2/1 many would respond 2@h and then 3@H non forcing|pg||
pc|c9|nt|eweber: good duck from East here|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, i think E overbid -- possibly for tactical reasons though|pg||
nt|eamongall: I am looking at any hope of austria getting through |pg||
nt|bernix: losing to monaco was the nail in the coffing|pg||
nt|eamongall: well austria have certainly done their best here ...currently standing at the maximum 25|pg||
nt|brolucius: You can take off a bit for the @DQ-x.|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|tomi2:  interesting positions, I got 10 msg now with THE best line|pg||
nt|tomi2:  @HQ is a nice falsecard|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Brilliant|pg||
nt|tomi2:  makes GromÃ¶ller believe Lauria has the 3rd heart|pg||
nt|tomi2:  so @D pitches will not work|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ady: will make 12 tricks in spades as they lay|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: board 15 other tavle also in 6@H|pg||
pc|hA|nt|Walddk2: Gromöller will think Lauria has the last trump|pg||
nt|odysseus69: dont think they play 2 over 1- didnt they stop in 2S earlier - after 1S - 2m-2H-2S|pg||
pc|c2|nt|tomi2:  but would have Lauria played the @H9 from 984?|pg||
nt|brolucius: South knows that declarer has a void club, otherwise he would have led towards the @CK.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Would Versace have played a heart from Qxx?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He did|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|h8|nt|ftpe: what tactical reason?|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|paulg:  when dummy goes down your first thought would be about making the contract, not two overtricks|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: Line for +1 is @cK finesse @cJ cash @CA and finesse @h9 - all abit risky|pg||
pc|d8|nt|paulhac:  True|pg||
nt|eamongall: in case we did not mention it ... Sylvia and Franz Terraneo were the austrian NS |pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: -1 |pg||
nt|brolucius: They don't play it, no.|pg||

nt|jameslee 2: down 1 |pg||
pc|dA|nt|haans: sweden UP again|pg||
pc|d2|nt|brolucius: A splendid tussle! Worth the entry money on its own.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He could have endplayed Versace with a diamond, but he was deceived by the @HQ return|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is a great hand!|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer could have made by playing a good diamond, for a spade discard if South did not ruff. But he placed the last trump with North. |pg||

nt|hawe45:  Good bidding system to find 6 @D|pg||
nt|athene: yes, very hard|pg||
nt|santyclz: This is the penultimate bd of the session.  Thanks to the EBU, for providing this for us.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Penultimate - does that mean, that they doÂ´nt play it...?|pg||
nt|athene: the auction in the other room is about how you would expect|pg||
nt|athene: east shows a monster balanced|pg||
nt|athene: west staymans for 4-4 heart fit and then just bids 3nt|pg||
nt|santyclz: Thanks to our operator, Jean-Jacques Thiry, great job!|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: Apparently they replay the board 9, wait for this one soon|pg||
nt|hawe45:  7 @D is not so bad, @C King dropping or @S-hook|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - or a black suit-lead...|pg||
nt|athene: you don't want to play 7@D on a hand like this where it's really likely they will not even bid 6@D in the other room|pg||
nt|shevek: sry andreas but they are 47imps behind with 2 boards to go|pg||
nt|MolvaM: u must have a note on yr cigarette package|pg||
nt|xenya: anyway once E has bid something, they were destined to end up in 3N|pg||

mb|p|nt|rnmalik: @C/@H Aces were correctly placed.|pg||

nt|tomi2:  great deal, yes|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: narazie 24-6|pg||
nt|odysseus69: so why not simple 2H over 1S?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: after only 3@S it is very pushy to go to 5@S|pg||
nt|vasmar: sorry they always make|pg||
nt|roswolf: 1nt may be tried|pg||
nt|andreasw:  so no beer,s:(|pg||
nt|MolvaM: smoking makes you miscount the trumps|pg||

nt|petergill: Most of these players started playing bridge when they were about 12 or younger - Stockdale, Brown (in an Australian town called Ballina), both Rimstedt sisters|pg||
mb|1H|nt|xenya: yes, good idea|pg||
nt|iyer7550: we could be seeing a lot of bidding on this hadn|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: 100/100|pg||
mb|d|nt|rnmalik: 3NT a big hand in N.|pg||
nt|Gerben42: looks like sure 300 vs uncertain 400|pg||
nt|hawe45:  That logic can not be right at both tables|pg||
nt|athene: 2@D = spades or 24+ notrump|pg||
nt|santyclz: Thanks to my fellow commentators:  William Frisby (England), Hans Werge (Denmark) and those who joined us for parts of the session.|pg||
nt|shevek: aggressive bidding by NS|pg||
nt|ftpe: page 2 in beginners book|pg||
nt|ftpe: 26 for game :)|pg||
nt|jkotor: W utrzymuje 3ba?\|pg||
nt|brolucius: Hacketts beat 5@C. Three rounds of hearts, declarer ruffed high and lost a trump to J-x-x.|pg||
mb|2S|nt|mcarroll: If they bid 4, defence always take their 4 minor suit tricks|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 2 boards left|pg||
nt|ritong: le redoutable tricolore fort|pg||
mb|3S|nt|haans: maybe :)|pg||
nt|haans: xx standard here|pg||
nt|pitiful:  e-w can make 3@s assuming south does not try to cash @c ace|pg||
nt|pitiful:  2@s|pg||
nt|xenya: but maybe he felt that EW in the other room would bid games at the slightest excuse |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: XX = 10 + point count |pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: i would have competed in hearts on the south hand via lebensohl|pg||
nt|lechcold: Adam tylko ziewn¹³:)|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: a one obuzy w trefla|pg||
mb|4S|nt|paulg:  nasty lead|pg||
nt|paulhac:  This could go a lot down|pg||
nt|paulg:  could easily play South for a 6-4 hand, and leading his second suit|pg||
nt|tomek: cz, jak widzisz|pg||
nt|vasmar: the overtrick on a ruffing finesse in hearts |pg||
nt|pitiful:  double showing a good raise is increasingly popular here|pg||
nt|jkotor: "mam kilka lew i ci¹gnik Cezary"|pg||
nt|petergill: Sandra and Cecilia;s little (twin?) brothers, aged about 14 (or less) I think, are in Sweden's U21 team to take on the World U21 Teams in Philadelphia in October|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 2@h now?|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: X  by East would mean penaltys |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: pass mean not much after xx|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: looks a 2@H bid |pg||
nt|ralfwil: with 8 points and @d support|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: lets see if it comes to bright |pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: this might be some artificial sequence|pg||
nt|chick: 3N seems like a good spot, I'm surprised that N didn't trust his partner |pg||
nt|snetram:  trefle  siÄ blokujÄ|pg||
nt|aldek: po treflowym nie idzie|pg||
nt|ritong: les systemes naturels ont généralement des soucis avec ce genre de main|pg||
nt|oleberg: South and West are screenmates, so it is probably weat considering 2@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|andreasw:  should make here unless N-S will find the @c switch|pg||
nt|shevek: they're busy playing @ss though|pg||
nt|oleberg: It wasn't|pg||
mb|p|nt|jameslee 2: 1 question know that we are finishing match |pg||
nt|brolucius: On 3@S - 4@S deal here.|pg||
pc|dK|nt|vasmar: now the contract is not safe anymore...|pg||
nt|santyclz: Thanks to BBO and Roland Wald for providing this service to bridge lovers worldwide.|pg||
nt|santyclz: And finally thanks to you, the kibs, who drive the whole process.|pg||
nt|tomi2:  Germany gained 5 imps on that non forcing freebid deal and two others in 16|pg||

nt|barnets: good lead|pg||
nt|barnets: very nice shot|pg||
pc|d6|nt|aldek: niestety nie blokuja sie|pg||
nt|marlowepi: etonnant que chemla n'ait pas ouvert la main S sur la  11, selon presque tous les criteres principaux c'est une ouverture nette.|pg||
nt|petergill: Declarer will make 4@S by stripping out the red suits and doing an endplay in clubs, 100% for sure|pg||
nt|petergill: need to play heart to ace and ruff a heart before playing trumps|pg||
pc|d5|nt|santyclz: Vg in your timezone: http://online.bridgebase.com/vugraph/schedule.php  Make it your home page!|pg||
nt|santyclz: There are currently only 14 tables on vg. http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/   lets you watch as many vugraph rooms as you want - one window per table|pg||
nt|santyclz: (Of course a 60" monitor would help.)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Looks like one too many|pg||
nt|haans: 23.45 central time next session|pg||
nt|haans: 13.45 |pg||
nt|xenya: so he didn't want to create swings|pg||
nt|haans: 10 tricks with @D 3-3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Spec suggests that Versace should have been in the Italian football team. He can play|pg||
nt|petergill: to start the "strip"|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: does anybody now exactly how the matches end and how many boards played to go over the round to next match |pg||
nt|oleberg: Whack it for 300|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, suddenly the black clouds have cleared away. |pg||
nt|bagman: Without diamond lead, West might have had some chances to make with an endplay|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|ady: west wants to clear trumps and then run diamonds|pg||
nt|ftpe: and he didnt :)|pg||
nt|xenya: right :)|pg||
nt|tomi2:  he is too young for this!|pg||
nt|lechcold: chyba odpuszczenie 3BA by³o jednak zbyt pasywne|pg||

nt|odysseus69: not good- great lead|pg||
pc|d4|nt|shevek: declarer might sneak 2 @s tricks and 2@h|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2NT= 6+@C-4@D|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2NT shows the diamonds without going past 3@C if that should be partner's preference.|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: is it a straight nock-out |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 9 matches on play |pg||
nt|bagman: In the end he would have elimnated clubs and hearts and can play @DA and another|pg||
pc|d9|nt|paulg:  good lead, although a spade would have had the same effect|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Unless defence set up a @C for declarer, they should come to 2@Hs and 2@Cs|pg||
nt|ftpe: after this lead down i think|pg||
nt|8252: encore une donne ou les distibutions ne sont pas urbaines|pg||
nt|petergill: Sorry, that leaves 2 @d's and 2 clubs to lose - I cannot count|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|eweber: 1NT was nf, so much is known|pg||
nt|vasmar: i don't know if N-S play a 2x1 system and if 3@s would be stronger than 4|pg||
nt|shevek: here....|pg||
nt|psridhar: with 3 kings and a 5 card suit that N hand is a limit raise with 3 trumps to me|pg||
nt|haans: NEWS: rona: madala opened 1@s and his p bid 3@ds//they ended up in 4 spades making|pg||
nt|iyer7550: on a spade lead 3nt will be in big trouble. |pg||

pc|d2|nt|ady: israel got 7 on board 14 in the thin 3NT    Ireland played a part score in hearts|pg||
nt|andreasw:  so 10 trick's|pg||
nt|xenya: but this is going to be a huge swing to Estonia|pg||
nt|me argent: la bonne nouvelle est K@S bien placer mais la mauvaise est la partage des atouts|pg||
nt|ritong: meme le grand talent de mari pourrait ne pas venir a bout de celle ci|pg||
nt|eamongall: those of us old enough might also remember a decent Austrian womens team in Euro champs 1991 in Killarney Ireland |pg||
nt|eamongall: they might have even won it but I reckon they definitely medaled|pg||
pc|s4|nt|tomi2:  don't know where N found a raise to 6 here|pg||
nt|vasmar: probably she thougth that 4@s was a conservative approach|pg||
nt|shevek: can play @hQ now and claim|pg||
nt|bernix: they won it|pg||
nt|jaapfr: if in the endplay you lose 2@D and 2@C it is not really made so need some luck with @CQT|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: who is first will be te winner |pg||
nt|ralfwil: 140/a70 in 3@s so this can go -3|pg||

nt|barnets: 4spades 3clubs 2 hearts and a diamond|pg||
pc|h6|nt|brolucius: I'm sure we all agree that we made a good choice of table to watch today!|pg||
nt|petergill: so she will go down|pg||
nt|jaapfr: not if she finesses @CQT|pg||
nt|petergill: NS need @C10, but the don't have it|pg||
nt|petergill: they don't have it|pg||
nt|jaapfr: rite you are|pg||
nt|ralfwil: the @d lead was a killer|pg||
nt|petergill: after the hearts are stripped out, if she plays a club to the 8, EW have to be careful|pg||
nt|rmb1: In OR, defence did not play diamond early and were thrown in late.  But we weren't sure where the tenth trick came from|pg||
nt|petergill: then they have to win @CA, play low @D to W, low @d back to the king, then club|pg||
nt|jillan:  same here, 2 rounds of @S ruff the @H and exit in @D|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Why a killer? opened up the defence|pg||
nt|petergill: If @C6 or @C8, low, low, ducked by @CA, then declarer exits in @D to make |pg||

nt|8252: il y a du avoir glissé dans les N° à @c|pg||
nt|jillan:  on this hand, declarer gpt a bit tangled up and went one down|pg||
nt|petergill: It is bold of the England, with four current World Champions in their team, to play their young new pair (Stockdale - Brown) in this vital match against one of the five top teams. |pg||
nt|petergill: Admittedly Stockdale - Brown are topping the datums with +0.93 imps/bd|pg||
nt|oleberg: Double must surely be take-out|pg||
nt|odysseus69: last board -thx all - some excitement|pg||
mb|p|nt|aldek: ja bym mlodych nie wystawial na Bala i Zmudzika|pg||
nt|bernix: unfortunatlely gabi bamberger passed away early|pg||
nt|jillan:  2NT is a transfer|pg||
mb|2D|nt|santyclz: 2@d or a @c splinter?|pg||
nt|cumino: bilanciatone senza cuori|pg||
nt|rialc2: secondo te non ha tentato il fit a @H?|pg||
nt|pitiful:  and e-w did well to bid and make 5@c|pg||
nt|lechcold: 4@H WE, 4@S NS|pg||
nt|jkotor: wskazanie wartoci przy ficie|pg||
nt|aldek: ale nikt sie mnie o rade nie pytal|pg||
nt|jkotor: kto mo¿e pójdzie w 5|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: zapraszam na mecz kobiet przeciwko Holandii o 17:35|pg||
nt|jkotor: mo¿e Cezary wiedz¹c o podwójnych fitach i s³abej wartoci defensywnej rêki|pg||
nt|petergill: (11) 12-14, transfer to @D, |pg||
nt|jaapfr: 3@S push push:)|pg||
nt|petergill: Resutls from Runnign Scores at http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/runningscores/asp/roundteamsconditstatclassicmod.asp?qtournid=817&qshowflag=1|pg||
nt|rmb1: I don't know how Stockdate/Brown have performed today but they have pulled their weight in the team|pg||
nt|oleberg: (Diamond-switch is annoying too, but still, hearts 3-3)|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: 4@S or 3NT, both the contracts make for NS.|pg||
nt|xenya: spade was led in the OR i'm told|pg||
nt|xenya: W was declarer there|pg||
nt|ftpe: diffcult to lead ace di|pg||
nt|xenya: the @S lead by N looks normal enough, so i withdraw my criticism|pg||
nt|ftpe: withdraw accepted :)|pg||
nt|xenya: and it looks like another disaster for the Russian team is coming|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: well a valiant effort by austria - couldnt do more but apparently not enough so denmark + portugal get thru - finals start tomorrow|pg||
nt|eamongall: I recall the surname ... there was also Fischer ...like the chess players mane |pg||
nt|eamongall: name |pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: are you going to raise to "a lot"?|pg||
nt|paulg:  a kib suggests at least taking the ace of diamonds to cash five clubs first and then play a diamond ... which saves a trick|pg||
nt|haans: the delay after W bid is because SE are on other side of screen|pg||
nt|ftpe: more imps for estonia here, dont think he can manage|pg||
nt|tomi2:  Piekarek ruffed the 3rd @D with no thought to play a skade, now Sementa will get the @H right I think|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: dziêkujê licznym a znakomitym komentatorom oraz jeszcze bardziej licznym kibicom|pg||
nt|petergill: France has taken a 6 VP lead in the Women's event|pg||
nt|oleberg: West will bid 5@C at some point. Unfortunately, East wont raise|pg||
nt|oleberg: (Unfortunate on this layout)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: what is S thinking of? or is it operator?|pg||
nt|oleberg: It might be West thinking|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I hope so:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|rigas_karo: last hand, good luck to both teams for rest of the tournament|pg||
nt|eweber: looking back all the big imps were won by style, board 8, 9, 14|pg||
nt|paulhac:  True|pg||
nt|tomi2:  now he committes himself to 4 level if pd has no @H fit?|pg||
nt|vasmar: for now Austria gets the lead after the unlucky slam of german|pg||
nt|psridhar: abt 25 % game i reckon ( dia 4-2 wih spd 2-2 also ok)|pg||
nt|oleberg: The oprator cannot use the keyboard before both screenmates have bid|pg||
nt|oleberg: That would give away the tempo|pg||
nt|barnets: England have played quite well this match|pg||
pc|sT|nt|haans: 2nd opinion: Rado: 2@H weak 5+@H4+m 3@C pass or correct|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: Last hand Sweden - Israel hope Spect enjoyed , Thx to Vugragher ; coments by hanns , psridhar &    hope to see you  later on |pg||
nt|psridhar: THX ALL THX JAIME|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: next match 13.00   & 16.15   thx to Spectators te most important in BBO |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: good match by both teams as expected very close result |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 13.00 / 16.15 paris time ty Hans |pg||
nt|psridhar: that 3S bid is really stretching too far...N thinking of 4s now|pg||
nt|snetram:  Åwietne zagranie Adama - umozliwi obronÄ 5 kierami 4 pikÃ³w|pg||
nt|jkotor: Cezary chyba nie zrozumia³, ale wysz³o dobrze|pg||
nt|snetram:  dlaczego nie zrozumiaÅ?|pg||
nt|eamongall: Doris Fischer I am told |pg||
nt|petergill: At the other table, the bidding might not have been as it is recorded|pg||
nt|jaapfr: tough decision for N|pg||
nt|petergill: 3NT has chances|pg||
nt|petergill: @D7 is the normal lead to 3NT |pg||
nt|jillan:  may even be easier to play the 4@S|pg||
nt|jaapfr: N considers a 4@C 4@H or pass bid |pg||
nt|jillan:  is west likely to find a heart lead?|pg||
nt|petergill: Other table : 1@D showed hearts and 1@H was takeout of hearts|pg||
nt|petergill: No chance of a @h lead to 3NT - East showed 6 @d's, did not show hearts|pg||
nt|odysseus69: quiet board to finish|pg||
nt|barnets: and it will be a close result|pg||
nt|odysseus69: have to leave- bye all|pg||
pc|s2|nt|motu: wladow does not know bids like 2NT in such situations|pg||
nt|vasmar: but board 19 will give back the lead to Germany i beleive|pg||
nt|MolvaM: last hand of the match here now|pg||
nt|oleberg: West is doing what he can, to get to 6@C|pg||
nt|oleberg: It helps him, that he is limited to 15 points, partner will know the nature of his hand|pg||
pc|s3|nt|pitiful:  doubled was the stripe tailed ape|pg||
nt|mamos: wow  was that striped ape do you think|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: thx to our commentators eamonn, justin, bernard - vugraph operator and hope to see you all tomorrow for the finals round 1|pg||
nt|jillan:  so this might make then :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4@C the lesser bid so pass or 4@H|pg||
nt|petergill: West (likely) or East (unlikely) will need to find a heart switch, if East puts up @DK on a low @d elad|pg||
nt|barnets: bye victor|pg||
nt|brolucius: So have the Italians at this table. There was that diamond lead against 3NT and the 7@D that they bid. |pg||
nt|bagman: bye|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|lmeili: never argue with DR Waldow :)|pg||
nt|reisig: disaster coming|pg||
nt|haans: dont ask|pg||
nt|vasmar: S is happy to pass|pg||
nt|roswolf: east will pass?he is normally very reluctant to pass an invitation|pg||
nt|mcarroll: on 19 4@S was made in Open, to account for most of the lead held by Bulgaria|pg||
nt|pitiful:  or at least he will claim that later|pg||
nt|jaapfr: @H|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|cumino: sry|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: @s @h @d @c last hand  Bye from Ostend @c @d @h @s|pg||
nt|iyer7550: looks like norway will score a moral victory|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: dobrze, ¿e tu sêdziowie nie musz¹ uznawaæ strzelonych goli |pg||
nt|jkotor: bez pasa Adama po 1@h-2@h-? te¿ mo¿na graæ transferami|pg||
nt|jkotor: 2@s = GF z fitem, 2ba=@c, 3@c=@d, 3@d=INV z fitem, 3@h=przepych|pg||
nt|petergill: Might be hard (impossible) to put @DK on 1D!0 = unlucky|pg||
nt|oleberg: 5NT = Pick a slam (I sincerely hope)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mamos: lol|pg||
nt|MolvaM: many thanks to all our commentators and our specs for their valuable guidance|pg||
nt|haans: 3@S must have been premptive|pg||
nt|marlowepi: je m'etonne a la ligne de jeu, notamment le deuxieme tour d'atout avant de jouer trefle et coeur pour limiter la note si les atouts sont mal partages|pg||
pc|s6|nt|andersk: calm finish, so the results as it stands now, is 15-15 in VP|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Its Stayman Jim, but not as we know it?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a @h lead was Killing|pg||
nt|jaapfr: duck??|pg||
nt|petergill: @D5 = discouraging, as South is "marked' with @DAQJ|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|ady: might be 1 too high    depends on view in trumps|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: very much so 0-6  4 card is the maximum preempitve |pg||
nt|psridhar: but that 3s worked in pushing Freding into the startosphere 4D|pg||
pc|d2|nt|tomi2:  trump lead|pg||
nt|lechcold: wygl¹da ¿e mo¿emy Holendrom odpisaæ jeszcze kilka VP|pg||
nt|petergill: This swing will halve the margin|pg||
nt|oleberg: Payback for board 14, where Iceland in open room bid and made a very lucky 6@S|pg||
nt|ralfwil: W will make this, so thanks all and I wish you all a nice Wednesday evening:)|pg||
pc|d5|nt|xenya: N doubled on slender values but 4-4-4-1, and S was happy to pass|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|eweber: if I weren't an aggressive bidder I would consider to convert after watching this match :)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  i would like to back to board 4 and 11 tricks was made!!!!!:)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: thanks andreas, nicoleta|pg||
nt|chick: This is the last board for this table,  3 yet to score|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|pitiful:  great hand to finish with|pg||
nt|pitiful:  well done to the dutch, they played very well|pg||
nt|pitiful:  after a slow start they are motoring |pg||
nt|mamos: the idea is you double 5 Level to stop them bidding Six then if they redouble you vanish to your save like a stripe tailed ape vanishing up a tree|pg||
nt|aldek: anyhow, great entertainment|pg||
nt|pitiful:  thanks to all watching|pg||
nt|pitiful:  bye now|pg||
nt|mamos: yes thsanks all|pg||

nt|oleberg: And a nice vening to you and everybody else|pg||
pc|dT|nt|athene: thanks all...|pg||
nt|maribelxx: another reason for the day being quiet is midsummer... all shops are closed, no public transport, people flee from cities to spend a few days in the country|pg||
nt|chick: Thanks to our excellent vugraph operator,  Michel Machiels, for a great job!!  :)|pg||
nt|jkotor: po pasie uzna³, ¿e ka¿da licytacja MUSI byæ z fitem|pg||
nt|ritong: il faudrait verifier si une ligne de jeu " méfiante" ne risque pas le contrat en cas de partages normaux|pg||
nt|marlowepi: il y avait une probabilite miniscule que N ait 5 coeurs (crainte de promotion d'atout), car il avait passe en troisieme aux couleurs favorables et il a deja le roi de pique en ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: plaus de ses coeurs--au moins|pg||
nt|ritong: bien  allons voir ce qui se passe dans l autre salle|pg||
pc|dK|nt|rnmalik: good bridge, 20 boards and such little difference.|pg||

nt|ady: good guess|pg||
nt|maribelxx: sorry :(|pg||
nt|santyclz: Thanks all, see you soon.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: ok andreas we analyze that board and send you the results by a sealed envelope|pg||
nt|tomi2:  not difficult after Piekarek has told him his exact shape...|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i would at least think a longer time as E to see how this can go down on trick 1|pg||
pc|d9|nt|haans: 9.30 central time tomorrow|pg||
