nt|jameslee 2: well they scaped from that one |pg||
nt|ralfwil: the only positive for ns is that it´s undoubled|pg||

nt|riccho: 11-13 SA bei Gro und Andreas|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|peachy: EW system is 4-card majors, light style 14-16 and 15-17NT. NS is Transfer Walsh 15-17NT|pg||
nt|athene: tricky hand to play - ruffing diamond finesse is a possibility|pg||
nt|bagman: There are lot's of high cards out and E passed and W opened weak|pg||
nt|athene: the problem is that ruffing diamond finesse might not be that useful, even if the king is with east|pg||
nt|athene: because if the @DQ is covered you have to use the @CA to get back there for a fast pitch of the heart|pg||
nt|athene: and that gives up on a double club finesse|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer wants a quick discards and wants to play the clubs for one loser|pg||
nt|athene: it's possible he might put all his eggs in one basket and take a normal diamond finesse; i.e. lead to the queen|pg||
nt|bagman: W  has shown up with @HKQ, does he have @DK and @CH?|pg||
nt|athene: the other issue is, you aren't necessarily going all-out to make|pg||
nt|athene: if it risks incurring two or three additional vulnerable undertricks|pg||
nt|bagman: S vulnerable he needs to make as many tricks as possible unless he has 9 safe|pg||
nt|bagman: He has likely 3 spade losers and a club|pg||
nt|athene: not at all an easy decision for south here|pg||
nt|athene: i prefer to open these hands 2@S first time|pg||
nt|athene: passing might appear safer but you often end up having to take more of a risk later at a higher level|pg||
nt|bagman: If he takes the straight diamond finesse, he needs to play @S to the Q|pg||
nt|athene: he knows the points are split fairly evenly between east and west|pg||
nt|bagman: Hoping for Jx KQxxx Kxx Qx or similar leaving E AKx xx xxx Kxx|pg||
nt|athene: west has weak-2 and east can't open - that doesn't leave much room for variation, with 21 hcp missing|pg||
nt|athene: the only problem is, there are a lot of variations in which cards each defender has|pg||
nt|bagman: If he places KQ of hearts and @DK west, he is quite restricted to place the rest for a make|pg||
nt|andreasw:  only lead is @S if u dont want to give any trick's|pg||

nt|yuval10: so no swing in a rather dangerous board |pg||
nt|yuval10: Israeli open for instance opened 1@c and played it wrong-sidedly, going down 1|pg||
nt|aldek: it can be made, but unlikely|pg||

nt|udo: 4 @H fails , even finding @H Queen doubleton is not enough|pg||
nt|udo: no entries for the 2 top-spades for diamond discards|pg||
nt|brolucius: East expects six hearts for a 2@H rebid that bypasses so many alternative rebid. Hence the raise.|pg||
nt|udo: hm, only 2 clublooses|pg||
nt|udo: losers|pg||
nt|othered1: with @CJ on, this does make (6@H, 2@S, 1@D, 1@C)|pg||
nt|udo: small @H to jack will be enough|pg||
nt|othered1: or win in dummy, pitch @C, hook rounded suits|pg||
nt|othered1: sorry, pitch @D|pg||
nt|udo: or 2 discards after heart to the jack|pg||
nt|othered1: (Ignore me, I'll awaken shortly)|pg||
nt|udo: jack of clubs is the important card, and it is well placed|pg||
nt|udo: same here:)|pg||
nt|udo: good morning ED:)|pg||
nt|tomi2:  I think they should not have bid that game, IMO east should have passed 2@H|pg||
nt|brolucius: At last I have managed to find a Lauria-Versace convention card. The 2NT response on Board 1 was a limit bid in partner's major. More often nowadays, 2NT shows a game-forcing ...|pg||

nt|lesniak: wietna zrzutka Adama|pg||
nt|oleberg: Unless I've missed an endplay|pg||
nt|oleberg: A third round of clubs will promote a heart trick, but diamonds have to be cashed first|pg||

nt|Walddk2: and 14-16 against Hungary today|pg||
nt|tomi2:  was his intention to duck the 10 or overtake?|pg||
nt|othered1: EW system is described as Swiss-ACOL.   I'm not sure how limited the 2@H bid was.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Duck, I expect, to set up the @HJ (or avoid losing a trump trick). Unlikely that they would duck @HQ - but possible at this level.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We got the names right now, thank you operator|pg||
nt|riccho: Die 1" klemmt bei mir manchmal... :(|pg||
pc|c5|nt|yannis3012: hi ntino|pg||

nt|brolucius: Now declarer can ditch his diamonds.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We can't expect her/him to have the  ö  on the keyboard|pg||
nt|mdgraham: would it be possible to have the player names please operator? |pg||

nt|yannis3012: evrything is in, so 3nt is cold|pg||
nt|eweber: it seems we didn't miss too much by starting a bit late here|pg||
nt|aldek: however south did not enter the bidding over 1@D with some cards in the majors,|pg||
nt|bagman: 1NT opening at this vulnerability was 9-12|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Souths aces perhaps justify the flexible double, but the long and tight hearts favour bidding on. Tough decision |pg||
pc|sJ|nt|haans: close to error|pg||

pc|d6|nt|pikolo: konserwatywny to tylko Adam :)|pg||
nt|bagman: With heart lead the contract would have gone down in quite natural manner declarer not having time to establish diamonds|pg||
nt|suketbombi: mat:)|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|Gerben42: Netherlands had a bad start vs Ireland, whereas Russia started with a small win vs Sweden, a competitor for a Bermuda Bowl spot|pg||
nt|shevek: Wales is running 6th|pg||
nt|MolvaM: seems many norths could just blast 4@s after hearing pd open a weak 2 here|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: should go off even with the @c lead|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: S is trying to make @S tricks problem no direct entry time for E-W to make @H good|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: still double stopper helps him to make contract |pg||
nt|odysseus69: difficult to keep oppo out of bidding- |pg||
nt|suketbombi: may:)|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|haans: 5@H risky|pg||
nt|xenya: @SA followed by @SK and another spade would have defeated it -- previous hand |pg||
nt|bagman: Now the defense has started to attack declarer's long suits|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes both of them. But obvious to dbl 2 @h??|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Bd 2 E open room|pg||

nt|skaftij:  so Israel will gain 3 imps only|pg||
nt|suketbombi: so that is clear 500 3 imps to israel|pg||
pc|dT|nt|lmeili: when @d QJ does'nt fall, still the chance @h 3-3 or Tx, and @c K on side|pg||
nt|bagman: It needs the heart finesse|pg||
nt|aap00: 1@c = strong, 1@s = looks like "bal GF", some relays|pg||
nt|ftpe: yes|pg||
nt|haans: few entries to dummy|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: getting worse after K@H|pg||
nt|haans: well only non vul|pg||
nt|brolucius: Only 1 IMP to Germany for the fancy play in 4@H. Semanta advanced with 2NT on the East cards, after the same start, and 3NT was bid and made.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: guys, was that a hidden camera joke? I meant 2nd trick a low spade towards dummy|pg||
nt|andersk: Or @C|pg||
nt|lesh: if the king of spades is 3rd in East, he needs A@h to be in West|pg||
nt|lesh: the small spade makes no sense|pg||
nt|h_karluk: I think today is Monday June 28, 2010, so obviously not April one, whatever|pg||
nt|justin c: if South's double was penalty, no reason for N to remove it that I can see|pg||
nt|babs59: isn't it now 18-19 based on inflation?|pg||
pc|d7|nt|aap00: playing @dQ, not 10 correct - you can discard 3d @d by @c|pg||

pc|d5|pg||

nt|bagman: But not any more|pg||
pc|d2|nt|motu: what about restriced choise|pg||
nt|mcarroll: S looking for N's entry for a @D ruff|pg||
nt|haans: many austrians have played Blue Clubs for 30 years|pg||
nt|MolvaM: specs tell me 3@s shows a no-singleton hand and a bad-bad hand|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: true|pg||
nt|bagman: With 4 spades and a heart it is enough to score only 4 tricks in the minors|pg||
nt|bagman: As both are 33 declarer can pick either|pg||
pc|s6|nt|santyclz: Certainly rates to be a much quicker hand in @cs than @ss.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Now has the problem of guessing the trumps to make 5|pg||
nt|aap00: thk no real chance to go wrong|pg||
nt|ftpe: he will win for sure, but migth take some time :)|pg||
nt|xenya: no -- he will play for @SKxx in the W hand|pg||

pc|d9|nt|haans: we have all learned yes on 8 no on 9|pg||
nt|star6ija: that is the question|pg||
nt|lesh: what it seems to be a flat board turn out to be a possible swing|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: real danger of an endplay here, I think a @s discard instead of a @d would have been better|pg||
nt|yusufb: @s iyi cýktý ama @c de cýksa 3@c caktýgý için batardý|pg||

nt|jkotor: na drugim stole 5@d bez X, nadróbka cenna :)|pg||
pc|h6|nt|brolucius: Those who play a 2@D response as game-forcing, will presumably have to respond 1NT on those North cards.|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes no problems for declarer|pg||
nt|bagman: Did not have 9 tricks: 4 spades, 3 clubs -> the defense can set up 2 diamonds|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: still|pg||
nt|yannis3012: yes. greek women are losing 10-0 after three boards from russia , one of the favourites|pg||
nt|andersk: -2 for a push|pg||
nt|ady: going down|pg||
nt|shevek: yes, a bid of 3@c/@d or@h over 2NT would show a Max with a shortage|pg||
nt|MolvaM: I see several 4s making with this board in other matches|pg||
nt|andreasw:  i have seen worse 2@s opening before|pg||
nt|brolucius: It may seem a bit light to bid 2NT on a 10-count, but both responders were allowing for six trick-producing hearts ion the opener's hand.|pg||
nt|andreasw:  cullin has to play @h now, else 10 tricks|pg||
pc|d8|nt|haans: not beg difference|pg||
pc|c8|nt|Gerben42: Netherlands is |pg||
nt|Gerben42: hosting the next Bowl so pre-qualified, but must improve to be in the medal race|pg||

nt|ralfwil: Did she play @cA? |pg||
nt|bagman: @CA, @C to Q, @DJ|pg||
pc|s2|nt|h_karluk: The Bamberger pair was good at their own sys, got many victories|pg||
nt|xenya: but it's odds in to play for the actual spade disitribution|pg||
nt|xenya: odds on *|pg||
nt|aap00: no squeeze chances, so N has to guess - play on @dJ onside or @hK remaining bare|pg||
nt|ftpe: and both works :)|pg||
nt|aap00: y |pg||
nt|tomi2:  2004 yes, 2008 not|pg||
nt|justin c: y, will take a couple of spades and put West in with a trump|pg||

pc|s7|pg||
nt|rnmalik: yep|pg||
pc|c5|nt|andersk: actually quite interesting start|pg||
nt|ziff:  @CJ is a bitextreme if he wants to look like someone with a singleton @D|pg||

nt|jameslee 2: hand 2 3@D contract also & same lead 4@D |pg||

pc|s8|nt|bagman: South is pretty safe now to make 2 spade tricks for the contract|pg||
nt|barnets: there are 7 more matches to be played after this one|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Gerben42: this was a good stop by NS - with so many HCP, 4NT might be too high|pg||
pc|s9|nt|brolucius: Only the scores against teams that also qualified are carried over to this second stage.|pg||
pc|sT|nt|ziff:  Whatever he wanted to do, he didn t fool Michael|pg||

nt|ady: this needed a major suit lead |pg||
nt|kdr_fm: nothing breaking (well @C 5/4) this is going off a few|pg||
nt|oleberg: Instead of trying to drawthrumphs, and control the hand|pg||
nt|odysseus69: no|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: quiet lookin partial, declarer probably making 9 tricks|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 3@H  6 card |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 4@H end |pg||
nt|lesh: unfortunately for E/W 4@s is making|pg||
nt|barnets: 5@D would be a good save down just 1|pg||
nt|brolucius: The doubletons in spades, also the vulnerability, are a deterrent.|pg||
nt|bagman: The defense has 4 tricks but they have not the means to take them (3 clubs and a heart)|pg||
nt|brolucius: The 2-2 spade break will now be helpful to declarer, providing an entry to the long hearts.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Murray lost first set|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer ruffs this, draws two rounds of trumps with QJ and starts hearts|pg||
nt|babs59: strange lead v. 4@C??|pg||
nt|odysseus69: and a strange lead-cant believe it|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: did well here, and in the OR as well|pg||
nt|MolvaM: running scores http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/runningscores/asp/roundteamsconditstatclassicmod.asp?qtournid=819&qshowflag=1|pg||
nt|MolvaM: norths 2@c could be the gazilli convention that several pairs play these days|pg||
nt|MolvaM: showing either a natural @c rebid or some sort of strong hand|pg||
nt|ftpe: hearts 5-2, so only 5 spades here|pg||
nt|aap00: so 4 is reasonable contract|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer has some sort of chance to ditch a diamond on one of the black suits. A diamond finesse and a heart break would then give him a chance.|pg||
nt|brolucius: South's signal on the top-club lead deterred Lauria from cashing his other high club, thereby giving declarer a diamond discard. Buit the @DK is wrong anyway.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Vladimir was in Warsaw Poland in 2006 and in Antalya 2007 with reasonable ranking, however this time surprised to his line|pg||

pc|c6|nt|andreasw:  yes.. 10 tricks next board:p|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer has 10 top tricks and 3 losers with no discards|pg||
nt|bagman: He has tested spades; not 5-0, claim time|pg||
nt|andreasw:  right!|pg||
nt|bagman: There is no way that defense would NOT play hearts, if he tries diamond to 9|pg||
pc|cA|nt|eweber: o.k., sorry|pg||
nt|davidb: good stop as 3NT -only 8 tricks|pg||
nt|santyclz: 6 imps to France on board 2 for going + in both rooms.  |pg||
nt|othered1: it's difficult to stay out of this game, unless west opens strong NT and east chooses not to act, vulnerable.|pg||
nt|lesh: should take much longer before claiming|pg||
nt|andersk: Kinda stragne 2 @C and 4@H bid from Charlie here, I would prefeer 4@H over 1 @H opening, isnt that what the hand is wurth?|pg||
nt|lesh: certainly 4@H would do the job. I dont think North would dbl|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this might make, or it might go down - that covers most possibilities |pg||
nt|mdgraham: but should make now, even if NS get a spade ruff, as a diamond can be discarded on @CK|pg||
nt|ralfwil: walter the valrus had made this easy - double with a voice of thunder - (Mollo)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Please no cricket scores on the screen, since I am recording it.|pg||

nt|jkotor: .|pg||

nt|andersk: agree|pg||
nt|ftpe: he now|pg||
nt|aap00: in brd 2 W(!) pushed to 3nt... |pg||
pc|hA|nt|h_karluk: declarer for sure would try long string|pg||
nt|haans: the more @D he plays the better defense|pg||
nt|h_karluk: we will see |pg||
pc|h4|nt|andersk: 990 now|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Will make now. If S tries to get a @s ruff a @d will disapperar on @cK and if NS takes their @d tricks, no communication|pg||
nt|ady: diamond back|pg||
nt|suketbombi: ye @D back is the best defence tho but @H ( is also good at this satge|pg||
nt|suketbombi: @H9|pg||
pc|h2|nt|chick: bypassing drury may have some kind of subtle implication about strength|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|Gerben42: changed from last time and will change again next time I guess|pg||
nt|andreasw:  3nt 11 trick's finessing @d|pg||
nt|othered1: i.e, it's a game virtually everyone will get to|pg||
nt|mdgraham: perhaps the real contract is 3NT|pg||
nt|ady: east cant be sure    but 9@H ok    |pg||
pc|h5|nt|athene: lauria's negative double over 2@D warned south off getting involved with his spade suit|pg||
nt|oleberg: Then again, he might not :)|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: bad news has arrived from the trumps|pg||
nt|oleberg: Nridge is easier, when you can see all four hands|pg||
pc|hK|nt|aap00: for me strange, with 10hcp and passed pd |pg||
nt|haans: not easy clubs finesse|pg||
pc|h7|nt|lmeili: if S ducks @dA|pg||
nt|bagman: I would guess that declarer discards a club on the hearts and gives 2 spades and 2 hearts|pg||
nt|athene: Sementa is prepared to lose his @HK to hold declarer to one heart winner rather than two|pg||
nt|bagman: Sementa's duck gives defense 3 spades instead of 2 spades|pg||
nt|brolucius: A high spot-card (@C7) is discouraging, against both suit and NT contracts. (Reverse attitude).|pg||
nt|justin c: leaving the @C suit blocked to keep entry to @HQJ|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a @s lead was defeating|pg||
nt|jkotor: polish or english comment here?|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I agree - lets the defence signal very comfortably|pg||
nt|h_karluk: the only possibility to make this a thrown-in play with misdefense of West|pg||
nt|aap00: so, "well deserved" -5 impls|pg||
nt|yusufb: turkish|pg||
nt|pikonlu: turkish|pg||
nt|jkotor: oh|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|haans: @H6 even|pg||
nt|odysseus69: I hate that 2C option - it just interferes with big hand with too little damage to oppo on weak hands|pg||
nt|j li: Schön den treffschnapper verhindert, aber einen zweiten Treffstich gibt es trotzdem nicht|pg||
pc|d5|nt|peachy: NS 1H opening might not be everybody's choice, but they play 4-card majors, light style|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: he will ruff a @H & open the clubs guess !|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer keeps the @SA as an entry in case he needs to finesse E for @HT|pg||
nt|suketbombi: he did not have @C count I think|pg||
pc|d6|nt|peachy: oops, he overcalled!|pg||
nt|ziff:  I must confess that I would not sell the E hand as 9+, but Entscho s judgement has always been somewhat different....|pg||
nt|h_karluk: pitch the spade and lose the board|pg||
nt|mdgraham: can you shed any light please operator?|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|MolvaM: this is a 630 or 660 hand for the field to rest their grey cells|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Thor Erik was in San Remo 2009, i guess evil made him do that double|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|andersk: will probably go down|pg||
nt|oleberg: Well, a double with a voice of thunder might not have been good. It might make if nort's strength is known|pg||
pc|d8|nt|athene: he will carry on with the time-honoured antidote to a 4-4 trump fit - keep leading trumps|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer can play N to have AQx and make now 10 tricks|pg||
pc|d7|nt|peachy: ignore everything I said, please :)|pg||
nt|bagman: Or W can let N to have @SQ|pg||
nt|athene: declarer probably thinks the club is offside|pg||
nt|athene: he will try and endplay north|pg||
nt|athene: duck another spade now, perhaps|pg||
nt|bagman: The @C-finesse working is an extra bonus|pg||
nt|andersk: maybe, I cant see what damage ¤@H direct might couse|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|xenya: i'm told there are no commentators in the open room, so I think i'll switch over there|pg||
nt|ftpe: now he plays safe|pg||
nt|aap00: oh, yes me too |pg||
nt|kdr_fm: W praying that @dT9 .... arghhh :>|pg||
nt|barnets: perhaps the hackets will bid 5@D they like to bid|pg||
nt|babs59: I dislike mixing strong bids and weak bids... as with the multi 2@D having a strong option.  That also hinders the preemptive nature of the 2@D multi |pg||
pc|sA|nt|haans: they do not show count|pg||
nt|andersk: Time to give @c count for East now|pg||
pc|s3|pc|s2|nt|haans: @DK must be cover both other suits|pg||

nt|shevek: coffee hand, brb :)|pg||
nt|jkotor: operator, do we know 3@c meaning?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but will S be quiet?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Quite common to play that two of a major via Stayman is invitational now. That restricts the option of bidding 2@C on South's shape.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: some advocate Stayman with 4-4 knowing at least a 4-3 fit - would not have been good idea here|pg||
nt|bagman: South has enough to be dummy in NT; no need to look for an 'escape'|pg||

nt|suketbombi: yes only way to make 5@H there|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Dbl by North shows 3@hs|pg||
pc|s6|nt|rnmalik: but for the @S finesse had a good chance to make it.|pg||
nt|roswolf: never likely to be bid though|pg||
nt|brolucius: You see how light South's 2@S response is. Everyone does that nowadays, to allow partner to compete if he has extra trump-length. In the Bad Old Days, a raise to 2@S was considered ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: a 'free bid' (particularly in the USA) and promised a king's ransom.|pg||

nt|yuval10: seem like a nice agreement|pg||
nt|yuval10: you have to play over the @h's in 4@s|pg||

nt|ady: 6@H  e/w|pg||
mb|3S|nt|Gerben42: weak 2 in @D|pg||
nt|Gerben42: refreshingly natural|pg||
nt|eweber: there is a tiny little chance of an endplay vs South|pg||
nt|wygbe1: guess i missed something, down 1 looked pretty easy|pg||
nt|yuval10: really hard to predict what the final outcome here will be|pg||
nt|tomi2:  am no fan of double and no fan of redouble here. what contract does Della Monta want to play doubled, iff ops bid it?|pg||
nt|yuval10: X from S is dangerous in the sense that sometimes P will pass and you have very few defensive tricks for him|pg||
nt|tomi2:  yes|pg||
nt|roswolf: another straightforward board|pg||
nt|bagman: p-p|pg||
nt|athene: 2@S must be a takeout |pg||
nt|bagman: S is confident in his methods|pg||
nt|athene: takeout of spades|pg||
nt|fokal: 2@d shows @s , strong or weak|pg||
nt|fokal: hi all by the way|pg||
nt|athene: maybe 2@S is specifically michaels|pg||
nt|bagman: Is it T/O or 2-suiter?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi.|pg||
nt|athene: many pairs play "leaping michaels" over these bids, so 4@D would be reds|pg||
nt|bagman: hi|pg||
nt|fokal: so I guess 2@s shows a two suiters for sure|pg||
nt|athene: maybe NS don't play that or maybe south prefers to treat his hand as a 3-suiter|pg||
nt|bagman: N has an easy raise of the q-bid :)|pg||
nt|bagman: if methods permit such treatment|pg||
nt|hawe45:  So - I was late from another match|pg||
nt|athene: north pretty much just wants to RKCB in hearts|pg||
nt|athene: but he might have to set hearts first|pg||
nt|MolvaM: double now?|pg||
nt|andreasw:  1@s and 4@h after 3nt|pg||
nt|udo: 7@D|pg||
nt|udo: or NT|pg||
nt|udo: lets see|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is natural to bid 4@H rather than 5@C because it is a trick less. When the opponents go to 4@S and you want to bid at the five-level, you have a free choice between hearts and ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: clubs.|pg||
nt|8252: tu as donc 2 pseudos|pg||
nt|ralfwil: As you said Mike a classic preempt with a good result|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: denmark on lead 8-0 Iceland|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: hand nº 6 |pg||
nt|oleberg: 1@D shows 11-15, 4+ diamonds, can have longer clubs|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: seems a 4@H by West|pg||
nt|oleberg: (No, I'm not guessing :))|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this 3N is a bit easier|pg||
nt|Walddk12: Welcome to Eric Robinson|pg||
nt|suketbombi: nice 6@H here inspite of @S watages|pg||
nt|skaftij:  West has a lot in reserve|pg||
nt|skaftij:  2NT GF, @h fit|pg||
nt|riccho: hmm|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: i agree with those 2 arguments you made|pg||
nt|shevek: neither side can make game|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 3nt seems not makable|pg||
nt|tomi2:  lauria only needs to find partner with two aces here, should be possible to find|pg||
nt|corplaw: hi |pg||
nt|bagman: Hi|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ziff:  In a marked contrast to our table Scotland and Italy have won 40 and 46 IMP in 5 boards.....|pg||
nt|lmeili: they should reach to 4@h, 1@c-1@d , 1N 2@c|pg||
nt|tomi2:  sometimes pd will jump to 2 level with 4 cards only and you have a hard bidding later|pg||
nt|tomi2:  os della Monatas hand now worth a raise to 6?|pg||
nt|yuval10: i believe W must add now....P is willing to play in the 5 level ALONE when he's VUL, and you have AK A?|pg||
nt|tomi2:  AKtx of trumps and the ace in their suit?|pg||
nt|yuval10: *she's|pg||
nt|yuval10: very likely that we'll see a sacrifice from NS|pg||
nt|tomi2:  if S bids 5@D now w has a difficult bid|pg||
nt|yuval10: Pass forcing?|pg||
nt|tomi2:  E-W are clearly in a forcing pass situation, but do you pass with TWO small dias?|pg||
nt|roswolf: unless n/s get carried away|pg||
nt|davidb: yes  no  great  boards yet...|pg||
nt|ady: can make 6NT    6@S  beaten on heart lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: the axe might descend here|pg||
nt|davidb: ??  aces...|pg||
nt|bagman: Ok, now let's see how the void is shown|pg||
nt|cameron_1: might chooce 4@s since Drijver's X was prob snapfragon style i.e. 2@s 5@c|pg||
nt|aldek: double showing clubs and a doubleton spade|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@D is natural. She has one diamond, so opens One Diamond.|pg||
nt|oleberg: And a good save in 4@S|pg||
nt|oleberg: Ok, a save|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: a block 3@S by N|pg||
nt|brolucius: Well, it was quite interesting how Gold approached the play - attacking his weakest suit first. |pg||
nt|odysseus69: a boring looking affair here|pg||
nt|odysseus69: can they look for a slam?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: dont think so|pg||
nt|andreasw:  hi Eric|pg||
nt|riccho: In Bd. 4 haben die Russen die Verteidigung gegen Vollspiel "gefunden". 4 Imps für die guten... |pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: it's never easy to bid a grand slam which depends on a void (i.e. where you are off an ace)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: still a possible 5 imps missed|pg||
mb|p|nt|eweber: but NS can escape by cashing their tricks|pg||
nt|lmeili: 2@h 3@h|pg||
nt|haans: close to spade raise|pg||
nt|yuval10: you have to do something with this AKTX trump and A@h|pg||
nt|cameron_1: choose a game i guess, a little strange because most use that to claim "ownership" and show a good hand|pg||
nt|mamos: what strength was 2@h   do we know - forcing ?|pg||
nt|mamos: will england bid on ?|pg||
nt|andreasw:  3nt should not win yes|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: could East X ?|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: can it be 3 card suport?|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: West can go alone to 5@H|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 5@H=11 tricks |pg||
nt|brolucius: England supporters can hope so.|pg||
nt|ady: 3@C   2nd suit     a bit dangerous with that holding|pg||
nt|ady: 4@C a cu   now 4@D?|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: he ruffed H with the Q, unnecessary|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like another boring hand|pg||
nt|lechcold: dziêki wejciu Brinka nasi dojd¹ do 3BA|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 3@C is more likely some kind of relay I guess|pg||
nt|udo: 4@S EW,,,,,,5@H N/S wird schon zu teuer, wenn man in @C falsch rät ( klein zur 9 )|pg||
pc|d8|nt|peachy: empting to Dbl with S hand|pg||
nt|peachy: tempting|pg||
nt|andersk: If 5@C makes, then 3 NT makes too|pg||
nt|bagman: If N can ask aces, S can bid quite a lot|pg||
nt|athene: did south think 4nt was asking for the minor?|pg||
nt|fokal: sementa has no idea of the @s void , he might try to protect his K of @s|pg||
nt|fokal: by bidding NT|pg||
nt|bagman: Now 5@S, I guess|pg||
nt|fokal: obvisously S interpreted 4NT as 'what is your minor , partner ? '|pg||
nt|athene: they might scramble into the grand if south finds 5@S now|pg||
nt|hawe45:  What was 2 @S exactly?|pg||
nt|bagman: It's bad to have your misunderstanding on a grand slam deal|pg||
nt|athene: but if there really has been a misunderstanding it's asking a lot to recover and go on to bid a tricky seven|pg||
nt|athene: 2@D showed spades, weak or strong (or some monster balanced)|pg||
nt|athene: so 2@S was obviously a cue - whatever they play that as|pg||
nt|hawe45:  So 5 @S now might do...|pg||
nt|cameron_1: i imagine tom was happy not to have to guess over an immediate 4@s from Brink|pg||
nt|MolvaM: thomas bids what he hopes he can make|pg||
nt|MolvaM: reasonable bid but doesnt work today|pg||
nt|MolvaM: but maybe pushes opps to 4@h|pg||
nt|xenya: 2N promises 20+|pg||
nt|Walddk2: His suit might not be solid :)|pg||
nt|lechcold: i wygraj¹|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 6T aurait eu une chance de gagner si E avait cache ses coeurs, mais evidemment 2C est 100% normale|pg||
nt|marlowepi: a cartes ouvertes c'est faisable meme sans entame coeur, mais le dec fera les deux impasses perdantes|pg||
nt|odysseus69: but maybe some exchanges|pg||
nt|cumino: J@D for a good slam instead of Q@C|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, I expect they will do their duty - taking a look for a slam - and then stop in game.|pg||
nt|bagman: Slam requires the spades to come in and diamond guess|pg||
nt|bagman: I have made worse slams |pg||
nt|babs59: more points, more substance to suits :)|pg||
nt|bagman: Even with @DA lead and @DK ruffed, 4@H makes as the @SA falls|pg||
nt|j li: Und schon wieder geht es nur um Überstiche|pg||
pc|d2|nt|rigas_karo: 4@s in 5-1 fit in the oper room, probably +1|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: looks like an easy 3NT|pg||
nt|boyklas: its difficult to find the Jxx after this bidding, except if he lead it|pg||
nt|ady: should south double if they get to 6@S    might remove to 6NT|pg||
nt|psridhar: difficult to bid 5d on their own last bd- needed push from oppo|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: a part score 2@S by West|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so W missed to find 4/4 hearts fit|pg||
nt|odysseus69: yes - that would be good- but no wasted club cards is what West needs |pg||
nt|yusufb: eller dengesiz geliyo butun maçlarda ilk 4 bordda baya alýþveriþ olmuþ|pg||

nt|wygbe1: and it was |pg||
nt|ady: problem is not there|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w were merciful but have missed the boat somewhat|pg||
nt|cameron_1: it is usally right to bid on know double fit hands|pg||
nt|tomi2:  but he should not bid 4nt too fast, because it could be keycard for spades, and partner would sell @SAK and no @CA as two aces|pg||
nt|andersk: 4@S is makeable, but <i do not understand why Charlie didnt look for @H suit first|pg||
nt|andersk: need to do something good in @s to make|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: hand 5 other room playing 4@S same contract|pg||
nt|ady: kib said 3@C minimum pt count|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|tomi2:  not hackett should bid 5@H rather than double I think|pg||
nt|ady: sorry    blind spot    2 aces missing|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: can go -1 with a good defence timming|pg||
nt|odysseus69: heavy 2D bid for English style|pg||
nt|suketbombi: wonder 4@S was a que or an exclusion key card BW|pg||
pc|sK|nt|rigas_karo: well this is an easy way :)|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Morning everyone|pg||
nt|peachy: Good morning Paul|pg||
nt|wygbe1: morning|pg||
nt|yuval10: very interesting sequence to work with your partner|pg||
nt|bagman: When a misunderstaning occurs, it's difficult to recover, because neither player knows what the misunderstanding has been|pg||
nt|athene: even if both players suspect, neither one can be sure his partner is in on the secret|pg||
nt|bagman: If N thinks that S has 1 ace and @S-void, he still cannot bid the grand|pg||
nt|athene: these sort of auctions are where top pairs really have to put in the time away from the table|pg||
nt|athene: because there are lots of imps riding on these hands|pg||
nt|lechcold: ogranicznie nie znoszê takich wejæ:)...|pg||

nt|star6ija: 11 tricks|pg||
nt|antoniz: Adam zagra przez trefle z powodów komunikacyjnych|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Good evening to Peter Gill|pg||
nt|brolucius: If West shows any interest in a slam (no, I see he has signed off), East would go there with three aces.|pg||
nt|ozgull: bu masada çok hýzlý oynanýyor|pg||
nt|bagman: Maybe not so unlucky as W was likely to have very short spades|pg||

nt|bagman: He needs to guess 3 things: a) 5@D shows the 2nd suit, b) S has 2 aces, c) S has @S-void|pg||
nt|athene: well there's no way anyone is guessing all that|pg||
nt|athene: what they need is some way for north to agree hearts|pg||
nt|athene: then it's relatively easy|pg||
nt|athene: but slam auctions are hard when no-one knows what trumps are|pg||
nt|bagman: I'm sure they'll go back to the drawing board after this match|pg||
nt|santyclz: Perhaps 3@s over 2?  |pg||
nt|athene: it's sort of like trying to build the top story of a house of cards and then fill in the first layers later|pg||

mb|1S|nt|lesh: a peaceful 4@h here, but lets see|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i guess slam @h|pg||
mb|p|nt|wygbe1: several roads to down one, as long as declarer assumes s has all the trumps|pg||
nt|yuval10: NS in the OR found the 6@d sac.|pg||
nt|roswolf: bd2 was flat when 4@S was also allowed to make|pg||
nt|fokal: on 6@h it seems clear to me that north couldn't make a move|pg||
nt|star6ija: operator, please try to follow the moves more precisely|pg||
nt|cameron_1: flat borad|pg||
nt|mamos: multi|pg||
nt|ftpe: ew migth go to 4 he here|pg||
nt|h_karluk: in practice very hard to reach, given layout diamonds favorably placed|pg||
nt|chick: Hamdi, the LoTT was originally devised by Vernes.  Cohen and Bergen popularized it, and Lawrence is the one who wrote "I fought the Law ..." disputing it's value :)|pg||
nt|pikolo: co ty bal na 8 inwituje |pg||
nt|kdr_fm: board 4 the austrian west did indeed bid 2@d Just like u suggest and another double swing|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: Spain had some yeterday againtx portugal at football :)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: maybe over 2D there were some other exciting responses- maybe 3D to show 5 good diamonds and 3 spades|pg||
nt|ady: hand 4 where Iceland could have gone down 1 in 1NT   Israel mad an overtrick|pg||
nt|j li: Ohne, dass hier sonderlich langsam gespielt würde!|pg||
nt|riccho: stimmt|pg||
mb|2N|nt|h_karluk: unless Sweden gifts some seems Austria's this team couldn't scratch something useful|pg||
nt|haans: standard bidding in 2nd hand no 2@H|pg||
nt|yuval10: so "only" 5 imps to Austria|pg||
nt|mamos: i think youd want to be in game|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 5c has much chances if declare can manage the 4-0 split|pg||
nt|tomi2:  7@D could be in danger of some ruff, not likely, but why take the risc...|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: 4H rolls now,, on lucky spade sit|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Although the K@S is right the K@D is wrong so 4@H is an excellent contract|pg||
nt|peachy: EW have a paying sacrifice, rare at Vul|pg||
nt|andersk: Might be possible to bid game here|pg||
nt|bagman: If North was confident that 4NT was RKCB in hearts, that was a good bid; no need to re-cue with 3@S|pg||
nt|fokal: but maybe S could (should ?) have bid something else than 6@h|pg||
nt|haans: the law is not the law just suggestions :)|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: another part score hand |pg||
nt|udo: guess after 3 NT Lauria gave him club A or King|pg||
nt|brolucius: If North has a club more and a diamond fewer, he would be delighted to hear of the @SK, which would give a second club discard.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: not guilty Maam :) i was living in an ocean away and the internet was not invented. i was just thirsty and eager to buy any foreign bridge book, thanks |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 2NT no move after |pg||
nt|oleberg: Boring partial|pg||
nt|ozgull: 2h kötüsü demek ama heralde ama ne kadar kötü?|pg||

mb|3H|nt|motu: 1N is 9+  with 4cMajor possible as you can see|pg||

nt|chick: 1N should warn S off from doing anything unilaterally and dramatic :)|pg||
nt|jkotor: na drugim zbieg³o 1nt|pg||
nt|oleberg: I wouldn't like to open the South hand 2nt. Partner might pass.|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 2NT= 8 tricks |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: think he will claim |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: straigh away|pg||
nt|brolucius: No doubt a double would show 4+ spades and 1@S denies spades.|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulhac:  Isnt it 800?|pg||
nt|peachy: oops|pg||
nt|peachy: I think I need another cup of coffee!!!|pg||
nt|wygbe1: if n had just shown limit raise values for hearts, they would be in the easy 4h contract|pg||
nt|paulhac:  6@D is only on the K@D 50% almost|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Without a heart ruff|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 4 cards M 4th seat|pg||
nt|andersk: looks like NT has to be played by S, but 5@D makes|pg||
nt|h_karluk: quite gross dissortion|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT   for n/s looks normal|pg||
nt|athene: well, it was only good if he was confident and he knew his partner was confident it was, too :)|pg||
nt|athene: that is one strange double of 1@C|pg||
nt|bagman: In confusion, it's often a good idea to bid something, which can be passed )|pg||
nt|fokal: X from sementa seems artificial|pg||
nt|haans: why did S not bid 3@H|pg||
nt|xenya: my assignment was for Closed Room|pg||

nt|riccho: 3@h = Verliererfarbe? |pg||
mb|p|nt|boyklas: maybe|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: should be|pg||
nt|wygbe1: i really think it is wrong to make a neg x with a fit for opener's major, this auction is one example of why |pg||
nt|yuval10: if N bids 3NT here def. must find the @d lead/switch|pg||
nt|bagman: I have never declared a splinter, but my partners have on some occasions |pg||
nt|xenya: sorry private|pg||
nt|pikolo: bal jest zawsze uruchomiony kwestia tylko jak bardzo :)|pg||

nt|ralfwil: 3nt is ok on N |pg||
nt|petergill: Yes that's the only game that makes, if hearts are led|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@C 17+, 1@H 8+ balanced|pg||
nt|petergill: NS Convention Card http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/May/WomensTeams/sweden/SandraRimstedt-EmmaSjoberg_SWEDEN_WOMEN.pdf |pg||
nt|mdgraham: there's something odd about the NS system file from ECATS. Page 1 is ok, but page 2 is peculair |pg||
nt|petergill: 3@S by South then 3NT by North, maybe?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@H looks like a control response, but I can't read the print|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@H = 8+ HCP, no 6m, no 5M, not 4M and longer suit is roughly what I can read |pg||
nt|brolucius: I am often thought of as mad in that respect.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 1S denies spades|pg||
nt|odysseus69: I am sure that at pairs Versace would have played heart jack- he felt that West had Q |pg||

nt|udo: 4@D -4@S|pg||
nt|riccho: sieht so aus|pg||

mb|4D|nt|collins64: after minor opening and opponent's double they play transfer|pg||

nt|barnets: not even x|pg||
nt|cumino: 5@d not doubledb board 4|pg||
mb|p|nt|boyklas: take 5D, 1S, 1H and leave|pg||
nt|lmeili: though 6@d makable, i would prefer for 3N|pg||
nt|tomi2:  they are on their way to 6@D it seems :)|pg||
nt|motu: 4@D is aceasking|pg||
nt|tomi2:  not 4@C?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: no matter @c lead|pg||
nt|andersk: @C A AQ in @S and @H J|pg||
nt|haans: 5@D jump may be based on previous bidding|pg||
nt|MolvaM: no 7600 distribution so far :)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  sry was away for a bid there:)|pg||
nt|ftpe: well ew had play for 4 hearts, but ns bougth contract in 2 cl on 4-3 fit|pg||
nt|barnets: 5@D passed out big swing for england|pg||
nt|yusufb: 3@c naturelmi yada minorlerden birini secmi onu düþünüyo salvo|pg||
nt|bagman: Trump switch unlikely to help as the hearts are so nicely|pg||
mb|4S|nt|eweber: Imp scoring doesn't seem to work, 5 Imps for Russia until Board 4, if I count correctly|pg||
nt|h_karluk: quickly jettison loser|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: good lord even adding T + 9 I cant see how N is worth 3 bids|pg||
nt|brolucius: A clever method, showing spades but not going past the safety level of 2@H.|pg||
mb|p|nt|motu: 4@C would be aceasking for @S|pg||
nt|tomi2:  but is @S suit possible after not raising?|pg||
nt|lmeili: 4th step shows how many key cards?|pg||
nt|tomi2:  2+@Dq|pg||
nt|motu: 2+ trump Q|pg||
nt|lmeili: tx|pg||
nt|h_karluk: to spades|pg||
nt|h_karluk: overtakes K and enjoys|pg||
nt|roswolf: with the diamonds 3-2 no problem|pg||
nt|udo: must be|pg||
nt|udo: 11 tricks,, next:)|pg||
nt|brolucius: 1@H must have been a transfer but I cannot see anything about it on the conv-card that I have up.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: mais aux yeux fermes|pg||
nt|barnets: so very fast start for england here|pg||
nt|odysseus69: this is going well for England but more significantly for Israel|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulhac:  Best lead but he could have led anything|pg||
nt|MolvaM: u didnt miss much andreas|pg||
nt|andreasw:  great:)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: declarer tries to protect himself against the 2 diamond honors being offside|pg||
nt|MolvaM: so he just gave up a heart trick that he could establish by taking his @hA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes it is, X would have shown hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They play transfers after interference|pg||
nt|udo: last time i played them ( San Remo),, they played transfers|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think a tad stretched 2@s works better than X there|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: na drugim stole to samo - arcymistrzowski overbid|pg||
nt|petergill: Fiona not missing out on the extra 100, plus a heart lead (sdummy's first bid "suit might ensue from her Dbl|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Dhondy used Leaping Michaels (4@D) over the 3@C opener. Wrong time - 500|pg||
nt|petergill: which would be great if South had another heart|pg||
mb|p|nt|MolvaM: the computer dealt hands makes everyone paranoid a little bit after a while|pg||

nt|james_h: not on this lead|pg||
nt|brolucius: All commentators are impartial, of course, but that only refers to their utterances on the screen. Some of them are cheering loudly at each swing in the right direction.|pg||
pc|h8|nt|motu: everything is possible here:)|pg||
nt|athene: just the five obvious tricks to lose here|pg||
nt|petergill: Susan as expected leads a heart - dummy's first bid "suit", after the Dbl|pg||
nt|odysseus69: best to cash 2nd club -then d|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|eweber: no miracle in the 4@h contract, but an imp for Russia anyway|pg||
nt|tomi2:  so 1 kexcard is missing and they stop in (a bad) game - I am no fan of this auction...|pg||
nt|chick: or a simple 2@H overcall|pg||
nt|justin c: hi james|pg||
nt|corplaw:  diamond to disrupt communications and set up ruff|pg||

pc|hK|nt|lmeili: at least it makes even guess wrong @s|pg||
pc|h7|nt|h_karluk: just needs to play a trump|pg||
nt|h_karluk: say East played Ace and switched back to @c|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ruff with K|pg||
nt|athene: red ace-kings and a diamond ruff|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: no entrys in West to develope the @D |pg||
nt|h_karluk: well aren't we ready to play at least 3 level in any suit ? |pg||
nt|chick: EW potentially had 3N, so a disaster for NS is not a given|pg||
nt|lesh: a possible 800, South has to be careful|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: tam król kier sie utrzyma³|pg||

nt|8252: EO vont mener 4 0 mais ça va s'arreter là|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: ya east has too many entries|pg||
nt|bagman: The defense can take 2 clubs, a diamond and two trumps + a trick|pg||
nt|bagman: the trick can be either 3rd trump wiht a diamond overruff or a heart|pg||
nt|odysseus69: and now 3rd club|pg||
nt|bagman: Another safe play would have been one high trump from dummy and then hearts|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|collins64: about the previous deal, you always have to discuss before is it or not GF 4@c overcall after weak 2@h opening|pg||
nt|MolvaM: now he can do his throw in|pg||
nt|jkotor: to mówi: "nie wiem czy ich X, czy graæ wy¿ej"|pg||

nt|riccho: hallo!|pg||
nt|j li: Hi|pg||
nt|sastro: moin Martin|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d8|nt|athene: no chance for the defence to get a trump promotion going and i don't see why declarer should take a backwards trump finesse|pg||
nt|xenya: S showed 5-4 in the minors, but clubs could longer than diamonds, so N had to guess -- hence his pass over 2@C|pg||
pc|d4|nt|collins64: West had a very nice hand with 19HCP and East Pass with 2 Kings and a 7-card Q10 suit|pg||
nt|rnmalik: oops|pg||
nt|haans: we all see the clubs finesse|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Italy gained 10 when Russia played silly 4C contract here and 3NT next door|pg||
nt|ady: can be held to 8 |pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|sA|nt|andersk: wrong slam|pg||

nt|jameslee 2: 10 @C could come in play |pg||
pc|s7|nt|collins64: x Kxx Q10xxxxx KJ|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: if 4@c is not GF easts is reasonable however, he thinks the hand is a misfit, and his K@h can be a wasted value|pg||
nt|andersk: a lucky make|pg||
nt|andersk: since @H K is together with 3 card @S|pg||
nt|rnmalik: no on a @H finesse can make 7. @D lead would force him to take a finesse.|pg||
nt|andersk: I must be sleeping, 6 is alw cold|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: Sorry for the rush for the previous deql now we are align with the players|pg||
nt|rnmalik: ok and thanks.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but still may go down|pg||

nt|ady: ooops     Patchman trying to protect possible entry and clear the hearts|pg||
nt|andreasw:  ok 9 trick's |pg||
nt|mdgraham: pity about the club ruff|pg||
nt|mdgraham: bit of a gift, that|pg||
nt|ady: sorry   9|pg||
nt|suketbombi: cud have made 10 here if he ducked the @H|pg||
pc|s3|nt|motu: i do not see why E went beyond 3N since 2N shoed allready extras|pg||
nt|ziff:  Not easy to bid, as W may have 5 @D and @SA instead of KJ, making slam pretty good|pg||
nt|bagman: No trump promotion but the old fashioned tap|pg||
nt|bagman: Now a heart and ruff with 9 ?|pg||
nt|haans: best not is spades|pg||
nt|aldek: who should bid 4, east or west?|pg||
nt|rodvenn: not vulnerable you should, according to the law, always compete to the 3-level holding 8 against 8. They make, you go one down in the typical example|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Ivan needs subway tickets to enter the table and that doesn't help much|pg||
nt|petergill: the club ruffs were hard to find - EW will be happy with plus 200|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|ziff:  Hope springs eternal, as they say, but I agree that it was agressive|pg||
nt|athene: he is more likely to ruff with the queen surely|pg||
nt|MolvaM: but its good for discussions after the match with yr teammates: "I could have made it even if both @d honors were off"|pg||
nt|haans: Body in clubs very good|pg||
nt|rodvenn: of course you may feel that your hand has intermideate cards in their suit which makes you take another course|pg||
nt|petergill: @SA then @HA is what I would do|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But is X only for a @h lead? not in my opinion, so a @c lead is not so far away. But in nt - yes|pg||
pc|sK|nt|eweber: I don't count correcly, 4:1 is correct|pg||
nt|h_karluk: now trump promo possible|pg||
nt|bagman: what would you do then?|pg||
nt|cameron_1: i think they play the method 3m=non max lin linked M and 3M=max in other M|pg||
nt|mamos: I dont think West can    |pg||
nt|haans: endplay in hearts|pg||
nt|corplaw: can make 4 by playing a heart, but chooses to cross ruff for 3|pg||
pc|sT|nt|rnmalik: No @H finesse 6.|pg||
nt|andersk: East will get a trumph raise|pg||
nt|ftpe: will be poor result for ns i think|pg||
nt|bagman: Easts spade is too low to force the @SK|pg||
pc|s4|nt|andersk: unfortunate for the sweeds|pg||
nt|h_karluk: the declarer should play a trump to K before touching @h|pg||
nt|cameron_1: so it was up to tom|pg||
nt|udo: hm,,,,was this the best line?|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|rnmalik: tricky hand after very good lead of @D. we have seen all cards so easy for us.:)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3@S in E is key to its making without finesse also which is % wise low.|pg||
nt|andersk: Austrians|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ruff and do that - now or never|pg||
nt|haans: and a make???|pg||
nt|h_karluk: not really|pg||
nt|h_karluk: if pitches and plays a trump to table goes down to @c shift|pg||
nt|h_karluk: if ruffs and plays a trump to hand always makes, thinner than a hair line|pg||
nt|haans: best play was not to cover|pg||
nt|Walddk12: Good morning to Peter Crouch|pg||
nt|xenya: quite poor, yes|pg||
nt|xenya: 2@D is certainly better, although i'm not sure it makes |pg||
nt|lesh: 500 now, against 4@h it is a good result|pg||
nt|marlowepi: un spec astucieux note que 6P est faisable sur la donne precedente|pg||

pc|hA|pc|h7|pg||
nt|benjent: roughly speaking, this will come down to guessing the @c's right|pg||
nt|rodal f: A new @H and E to find the @C?|pg||
nt|benjent: Gromov may get it right just on point count - he'll see @sK, @hA with N, and @hk with South|pg||
nt|rodal f: But should be easy after testing the @S|pg||
nt|rodal f: Can't @C still be by the opener?|pg||
pc|d6|pc|dQ|pc|d4|pc|h3|pg||
nt|benjent: He won't quite see which way the @s's break. If he knew North had 3@s, he would place him with 3352 or 3361. The 3361 is more likely  (a) because he opened junk and (b) South ...|pg||

nt|collins64: if it is NF|pg||
nt|paulhac:  England takes the lead for the first time.|pg||
nt|andersk: unlucky board for the Austrians|pg||
nt|h_karluk: west still should refuse to overruff for a late trump promo possibility|pg||
nt|yuval10: and she did|pg||
nt|roswolf: overtrick imps to ireland|pg||
nt|bagman: sure, Q works when there is a legal chance for beat|pg||
nt|bagman: 9 works only as deception|pg||
nt|andreasw:  again board 4 is wrong!!!|pg||
nt|shevek: quite a few declarers went down in 3NT here|pg||
nt|MolvaM: andreas maybe you shld forget the past and move on :)|pg||

nt|udo: i am not yet awake, but i doubt it|pg||
nt|marlowepi: mais encore une fois c'est a cartes ouvertes|pg||

nt|andreasw:  good safe play|pg||
nt|j li: Wer eröffnet mit West?|pg||
mb|1C|nt|roswolf: 2 suiter i think|pg||
nt|roswolf: they multi with a 1 suiter weak 2|pg||
nt|bagman: or is it actually so?|pg||
nt|andreasw:  neeeverrr:)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 3@c shows what?|pg||
nt|shevek: no, not from here !|pg||
nt|MolvaM: both minors?|pg||
nt|shevek: 3@c = 5-5 in the minors|pg||
nt|andreasw:  it should|pg||
nt|hawe45:  E/O ou N/S?|pg||
nt|ady: apparently made 10|pg||
mb|1D|nt|collins64: another 2@c opening in North|pg||
nt|athene: will south double 2@H or bid 2@S?|pg||
nt|riccho: Andreas|pg||
nt|sastro: Kirmse|pg||
nt|riccho: :)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|andersk: Italy running good in Bridge, but currently out of the world cup|pg||
nt|star6ija: 3N is possible here|pg||
nt|aldek: I'd say west should bid on the base of the quality of the spades, an ace and a singleton|pg||
nt|cameron_1: i agree|pg||
nt|andreasw:  i will go a few times and be back after 10 second's have to see score's from danaish match:)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  danish*|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 3nt would be nice if thomas knew about the @hK with partner|pg||

nt|jameslee 2: other room playing 5@D X also on hand nº 5|pg||

nt|Walddk2: I would be reluctant to question any line by Lauria :)|pg||

nt|kdr_fm: board 6 3NT made cutting the damage @s lead|pg||
nt|justin c: decent 6@S here|pg||
nt|eamongall: well folks ye better get your armour on ...as Michael has just been mugged in the other room |pg||
nt|odysseus69: hands up those who like 1NT - my hand stays down|pg||
nt|udo: ich eigentlich immer, auch wenn  meinem Partner dann manchmal die Haare zu Berge stehen|pg||
nt|riccho: Also Dein Partner dann wahrscheinlich nicht... :)|pg||
mb|3D|nt|collins64: both majors at least 44|pg||
nt|boyklas: i think he judged that the hand shouldnt be to game with the singleton S and the KH wasted value after showing C+S|pg||
nt|bagman: If partner has Txx left, both the 9 and the Q work; what about other holdings?|pg||
nt|ftpe: boring cards again|pg||
nt|justin c: expect south will drive to slam now|pg||
nt|udo: wenn ein Fit zu Tage kommt, ist es gut,,wenn es in Sa endet, meist grausam|pg||
mb|3S|nt|star6ija: stubborn @s stopper|pg||

nt|udo: me too,,,therefore i asked only:)|pg||
nt|othered1: for 10 tricks, I don't see better|pg||
nt|brolucius: The players in the Open Room are not exactly burning the baize with their playing speed, They are three boards behind already.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 7 boards and 24 IMPs exchanged, interesting|pg||
nt|aldek: przeczytaj moje pytanie, prosze|pg||
nt|petergill: EW Convention Card http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/May/WomensTeams/england/stockdale-brown.pdf|pg||
nt|bagman: NS can make 4@H here, the 11th trick can come from the spade lead or spade guess|pg||
nt|brolucius: Gold found an 11-count that he was willing to pass. (Only a jack in the long suit, and four jacks in all.)|pg||
nt|bagman: Now he needs to describe the 'impossible' hand|pg||
nt|riccho: 3F sind immer schwer zu judgen|pg||
nt|motu: ich würde vermutlich passen|pg||
nt|j li: Ich bin auch ein Passant|pg||
mb|p|nt|jameslee 2: East a take out 2@D on a dangerous 1Nt X|pg||
nt|lesh: probably E will bid 2@s or 2@h|pg||
nt|yusufb: 3@d|pg||
nt|corplaw: that is E-W bidding|pg||
nt|ady: n/s  have 3NT|pg||
nt|riccho: In einem NAT System wie Gro und Andreas es spielen, würde ich vermutlich auch passen. |pg||
mb|4C|nt|paulhac:  IF East had been the overcaller one could say that Spain were unlucky|pg||
nt|h_karluk: well, sorry i disagree that was unlucky|pg||
nt|roswolf: south will no doubt transfer and offer his pard a choice of games|pg||
nt|shevek: you can watch any match here :)  http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|andreasw:  thx mucht|pg||
nt|andreasw:  3@h slam invit?|pg||
nt|shevek: looks like it|pg||
nt|andreasw:  no best slam with @d AK out:)|pg||
nt|shevek: but 5@d is not a make|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 5d seems ok since defence cannot take their club ruff with a small trump|pg||
nt|rodvenn: Very good bridge to reach 5 @d in both rooms. |pg||
nt|james_h: 2@d XX being played at the other table|pg||
nt|james_h: NS|pg||
nt|eamongall: The Great Mulall managed 2@DXX a few months ago in the Regent up 3 ... Michael is not having the same success |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: another missfit in @S for N-S|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: shooting to 3NT |pg||
nt|brolucius: He may bid 3@S to show a sound raise to 4@H. No, 2NT does the job.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 2NT is a heart raise|pg||
nt|odysseus69: cant imagine them missing game|pg||
nt|bagman: Townsend has enought to bid/force to game|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: or the score is wrong -- that happens from time to time|pg||
nt|lesh: but over 2@h West might blast to a game|pg||
nt|oleberg: The natural @D lead, will give the 9.th trick immidiately|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 3NT with a missfit is alays veryvery dificult |pg||
nt|oleberg: The natural heart lead is better :)|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 1 of the thing we try to teach bridge students is to go to game to 3NT with a fit in a minor |pg||
nt|mdgraham: and mine|pg||
nt|riccho: In precision würde ich auch passen, um nicht 2@c aufmachen zu müssen|pg||
mb|4D|nt|chick: don't think a major suit game is possible|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: Buras wita sie z g¹sk¹ - poszli mu w kiera...|pg||
nt|hawe45:  OK - cÂ´est possible|pg||
nt|petergill: EW at the other table won the World Junior (U26) Pairs Championship in 2006 in Piestany, Slovakia, the only female pair ever to do so|pg||
nt|petergill: Cecilia Rimstedt was only 18 at the time, I think|pg||
nt|corplaw: bidding is off|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes must be|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: 2NT might have been alerted, otherwise I don't understand it|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 5@d good|pg||
nt|shevek: actually might make|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: second X pass out |pg||
nt|psridhar: this can be set 800|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: quite  a few down -3/-4 could be the result|pg||
nt|brolucius: If Madala had passed, some use 2NT by North to show a sound four-card heart raise and 2@S to show a sound three-card raise.|pg||
nt|bagman: 3NT might be makeable here|pg||
nt|suketbombi: nothing helps here not even the @S lead|pg||
mb|4S|nt|wygbe1: probably lebensohl|pg||
nt|santyclz: The 6@h+1 ended as a push.  Neither n/s was able to overcome the preempt.|pg||
nt|star6ija: happens... :)|pg||
nt|shevek: yes|pg||
nt|haans: easier to play 2@D doubles not game sore if make|pg||
nt|psridhar: if defense can find the club ruff-they will get plenty of opportunities for the ruff|pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: Tam wyszli po raz drugi w Kiera. Alew chyba nie dadza rady wypuciæ|pg||
nt|8252: on devrait abdiquer, les @s ont souvent raison|pg||
nt|james_h: 19 imps|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: whoa 2200 ...|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: here after a major 2@S= very dificult to be in a correct contract |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: @S brake nicely |pg||
nt|riccho: Jetzt bekommt Andreas hier mit seiner Hand aber Frühlingsgefühle... |pg||
mb|p|nt|lesh: well looks like over 2@s as well :)|pg||
nt|chick: perhaps with a club finesse to dump a heart, this could make|pg||
nt|snetram:  3 kier forsowaÅo do koÅcÃ³wki, wiÄc pas zaprasza do szlemika|pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: Gdyby @CAs by³ u W, by³by przymus...|pg||
mb|p|nt|ftpe: he will try ruff 2 di at hand|pg||
nt|lesh: the defence has to be careful|pg||
nt|babs59: Russia are in 6th place on 180 with France close behind on 178.  After that there's a bigger gap, Netherlands on 164...|pg||
mb|p|nt|eweber: in board 4 NL managed to win 4 by making 2@d, so 5:4 for them now|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Lebensohl or transfer Lebensohl. Transfer Lebensohl would show both monors|pg||
nt|peachy: even down 1, this be small gain for England|pg||
nt|peachy: and it could slip home|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Which is Jason and which is Justin?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ty|pg||
nt|chick: now very hard to make|pg||
nt|h_karluk: seems clubs hook needed|pg||
nt|snetram:  gdyby chciaÅ graÄ tylko 5 powinien sam licytowaÄ 5|pg||
nt|eamongall: and unfortunately in the not to distant future Eamon Galligans name will be mentioned in Ostend by the Ireland npc .... as I went for 2200 in Brighton as he whispered "donkey" ...|pg||

nt|shevek: can't score a ruff on top of AK|pg||
nt|lesh: he didnt has the entry ,however the small spade gave it|pg||
nt|h_karluk: then ruff hearts and try devil's coup|pg||
nt|petergill: At least 8 tricks for NS, even on a trump switch|pg||
nt|oleberg: Like Zia says: When you have the @D9, PLAY IT|pg||
nt|j li: Gut den Karoangriff vermieden!|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|athene: the auction in the other room looks like an interesting twist on leaping michaels - you bid 4 of the minor you haven't got|pg||
nt|athene: that is perhaps sensible if you play the bids as forcing|pg||
nt|bagman: Thx all. I need to go now, see you again.|pg||
nt|bagman: bye|pg||
nt|santyclz: Thanks Pekka.|pg||
nt|athene: bye thanks|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: I think the irish fans need to start some serious prayers - its looking grim|pg||
nt|babs59: Netherlands, as host country, will have a place in the Bermuda Bowl field regardless|pg||
nt|bagman: If declarer guesses the clubs he has 9 tricks|pg||
pc|hA|nt|eweber: quite many warm up boards so far|pg||
nt|haans: @HK good play|pg||
nt|chick: really?|pg||
nt|babs59: Belgium is hosting the selection event, but I thought 2011 Bermuda Bowl etc slated for Netherlands?|pg||
nt|bagman: IF not, he might have time to establish the diamonds|pg||
nt|andreasw:  why board 8 here?|pg||
nt|bagman: If declarer loses a club trick to South, he returns a heart. West's spots are good enough to stop defense from taking 3 heart tricks|pg||
nt|andreasw:  he will take it with q and finesse clubs|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|collins64: @s to the J and it's over|pg||
nt|wygbe1: that lead may allow it to slip home|pg||

nt|shevek: yes|pg||

nt|jameslee 2: 9@D   a not bad play he will make 9 tricks |pg||

nt|j li: Man wird die Gegnerhände auszählen können bis auf eine UF-Karte|pg||
pc|c7|nt|athene: it looks at first as though declarer might be able to hold his losers to two trumps from here, if he guesses right, but there's just too much work to do, i suppose|pg||

nt|chick: hehe|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|star6ija: 12 tricks may be taken now|pg||

nt|ady: Israel gained 2 imps on hand 5  going down 1 in 3@S|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ziff:  We can see that the contract is cold, but declarer can see only 8 tricks|pg||
nt|athene: ok, this is just doing his work for him|pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: Graja 3 Dzwonki|pg||
nt|bagman: Anyhow, the non-spade lead indicates the @SA|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|brolucius: Good point.|pg||
nt|bagman: With trumps breaking the declarer has an easy claim|pg||
nt|bagman: West needs to win this|pg||
pc|s4|nt|rigas_karo: nothing else here i think, @s to the K and claim|pg||
nt|collins64: yes West need to lead A@h to beat the contract|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: there is nothing he can do if @s are 4-1|pg||

nt|jameslee 2: K@D the 9 th trick|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: wd South|pg||
pc|s6|nt|jkotor: na oko odda pika i 2kara|pg||
nt|andreasw:  no Ace finesse clubs |pg||
nt|sastro: Plan ist klar- Ost soll auf Pik-Schnitt verzichten und N bekommt noch nen Schnapper wenn Partner @H -König hält|pg||
nt|riccho: hmm|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|brolucius: Declarer would have had time to set up the clubs after a heart lead from West.|pg||
nt|tomi2:  for me it is quite impressive how many teams did not bid the grand in 6 till now|pg||
nt|bagman: Now the defense has 2 heart tricks ready|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|tomi2:  bulgaria in 5@D, Norway in 6@D|pg||
nt|othered1: east doesn'thave the most comfortable of pitches|pg||
nt|jkotor: szczególnie po pikowym|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lesh: going down now|pg||
nt|odysseus69: think hes home now unless defence finds spade switch|pg||
nt|riccho: @sK stellt sicher, dass der Gegner es richtig macht|pg||
pc|d3|nt|boyklas: claim|pg||
nt|lmeili: pretty safe to win @hA if the lead from 4th, set up a @d trick as 9th |pg||
nt|xenya: 9 tricks now on a cross ruff|pg||
nt|chick: so a grosvenor duck by N sets this :)|pg||
nt|petergill: My job was to photograph the Swedish girls for the Bulletin after their win in Piestany. Cecilia said "Please wait until I make myself look better." I thought that was impossible. ...|pg||
nt|petergill: I will see if I can show find the photo for you|pg||
nt|odysseus69: no - defence still ok as long as not club|pg||
pc|cK|nt|athene: spade force looked the natural play - perhaps Duboin was worried about forcing declarer too much and helping him into a trump coup against north's known heart length|pg||
nt|haans: Fallenius do not like it :(|pg||
nt|psridhar: Fredin must be ruing his decision to upgrade his hand to 1NT opening|pg||
nt|lechcold: -2 siê szykuje tutaj|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|boyklas: i think its not reasonable to lead the AH|pg||
nt|collins64: for sure|pg||
nt|ftpe: solid play|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|rigas_karo: certainly not!|pg||
nt|haans: flat|pg||
nt|petergill: All four are in their (mid) twenties at this table. |pg||
nt|oleberg: I thought he might have played his heart|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: spec asked me if spain will play Argentine after quater-finals ???|pg||
pc|c9|nt|tomi2:  San Marino should agree on their 2/1 follow ups too, 3@D was not a great score|pg||
nt|udo: jetzt schauts doch ganz gut aus:))|pg||
pc|c6|nt|udo: 5 imps italy in board 5,,,NS bid on to 5 @S ,,against the probably making 5@C|pg||

nt|peachy: the end|pg||
nt|aldek: why didnot Townsend bid 3@S?|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: what do you all think?|pg||
pc|h4|nt|bagman: WIth his heart stopper declarer can afford to take a diamond finesse for overtrick now|pg||
nt|riccho: Überstich oder?|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ryskiel_: ach ten chciwy Bal|pg||

nt|ziff:  I am not surprised....|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: I see that on the rama but no idea on the subject|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: maybe on the slow playing|pg||
nt|tomi2:  yeaterday Nerherlands - Russia was scored as 18-2 VP because of 5 VP for each team|pg||
nt|lmeili: because of slow play?|pg||
nt|tomi2:  yes, as far as I know|pg||
nt|lmeili: that was a heavy penalty!|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: If I have good information they finish 20 minutes late in that match|pg||
nt|tomi2:  10 VP for 20 minutes? thats a lot|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: restarting here|pg||
nt|athene: which means duboin can't have had a count on the diamonds - if he knew declarer had four he would have bashed out that @S10 like a shot|pg||
nt|athene: the standard counter to a 2-suiter being to force declarer|pg||
nt|andreasw:  then a @d to ace and a @s back |pg||
nt|haans: yes dirty upscore|pg||
nt|psridhar: might hv worked on some other layout |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: yes 800 always dangerous|pg||
nt|lesh: here we go :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 5@c/@d ok|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: the @D was abit of desperation ... if left to her (i'm told) own devices declarer will have to gess is it @dKxx or @dKx|pg||
nt|cumino: May be board 6 is a bit delicate if EST opens 1S|pg||
nt|riccho: Gar nicht so einfach immer die brettharte defense zu finden... wie man hier sehen kann|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: israel made 3nt on bd 4 for another game swing|pg||
nt|ady: partial here in spades   Ireland need to keep low|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes may well get too high|pg||
nt|psridhar: Fredin will briefly consider 3nt b4 bidding 4s when he finds out his pd has unbal hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: There was no follow-up to discuss. North jumped to 3@D, South thought it was a WJS and passed|pg||
nt|cumino: 1NT|pg||
mb|2C|nt|Gerben42: apparently the rooms are connected now|pg||
nt|Gerben42: white vs red NS are very agressive, but as we have seen vuln. they are middle of the road|pg||
nt|eweber: 3@s is not exactly what you'd dream of with the South hand...|pg||
nt|Gerben42: best to not dream but pass with a happy face|pg||
nt|eweber: I assume West is the one who is taking his time here|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Great to see the Irish at the top of the leader board|pg||
nt|josj: as far as I know, they were about 30 mins. late and were eventually fined 3 VP each|pg||
nt|tomi2:  getting informed that they got 3 VP back each|pg||
nt|tomi2:  thx|pg||
nt|athene: ok :)|pg||
nt|aldek: England on the board|pg||
nt|andreasw:  @d to king and alot of @s trick's|pg||
nt|shevek: south can only get in once (@dK)|pg||
nt|ftpe: that opening will probably bring them to 6 spades|pg||
nt|xenya: on 7, the Estonian EW in the other room got to 4@H -- not a bad contract really, but down on foul trump split -- 1 down and 7 imps to Russia|pg||
nt|ftpe: in 6 spades he has to guess spade queen, but best chance is playing on sp 2-2|pg||
nt|haans: 10-13|pg||
nt|lechcold: 54 impy w 8 rozdaniach|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: Unfortunate lie of the cards, but will be the same in the other room  one assumes|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hmmm?|pg||
nt|athene: my guess is they put the board on the table upside down|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hand reversed?|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: ty vugragher |pg||
nt|oleberg: Well, if you play Ghana in football, I guess a black squeeze is possible|pg||
mb|2D|nt|boyklas: FG raise with D?|pg||
nt|boyklas: or 14+ Bal?|pg||
nt|haans: that 1@S overcall???|pg||
nt|xenya: i don't think 6@S is such a great contract -- problems in spades and diamonds|pg||
nt|ftpe: agree, but they will get there after ligth open, |pg||
nt|xenya: well the 3@H bid makes it easier to solve the spade problem|pg||
nt|haans: Fredit pass??????|pg||
nt|udo: Ed,Tomi,Roland,,thks so far,,,have to leave for work:)  would like to stay here..|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thanks Udo|pg||
nt|mdgraham: quite a rate of exchanges - 56 imps in 7 boards|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 3nt  by NS likely to fail as nothing works for the 9th trick however 5@C is a great contract and aMake|pg||
nt|suketbombi: @@@S pd bid on if @H is ur suit|pg||
nt|ady: 2@D  multi     2@S   shows good heart support   but sign of for spades|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 2@S|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Might make 3Nt by ducking @s and organizing endplay of West|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes|pg||
nt|riccho: O verkauft seine Hand notgedrungen als BAL |pg||
mb|p|nt|ftpe: after 3 he better chance to play north for Qxx in sp|pg||
nt|haans: ERROR|pg||
nt|brolucius: Work? What is that?|pg||
nt|tomi2:  then they should discuss their first round of bidding as well :)|pg||
nt|justin c: @D losers were going on the @HKQ|pg||
nt|odysseus69: where 3NT was 3 down here it was 4 down in Open Room despite 6 tricks on top|pg||
mb|2H|nt|collins64: 2NT is GF with @d|pg||
nt|collins64: GF with 4+ @d|pg||
nt|boyklas: 6D makes here|pg||
nt|collins64: 3NT 12-14 balance|pg||
nt|boyklas: with the AH in his place|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: difficult decision for South here|pg||
nt|andersk: 3 NT?|pg||
nt|peachy: operator doing great job, keeping up with the fairly fast pace at the table|pg||
nt|pitiful:  4@h not timid|pg||
nt|xenya: yes|pg||
nt|udo: i will send u an E-Mail, david|pg||
nt|brolucius: Thx.|pg||
nt|lesh: what might appeared to be a sacrifice for N/S it will be a makable game :)|pg||
nt|chick: 3@D is enough|pg||
nt|lesh: they need to find @c support|pg||
nt|lesh: 1@d has to be alerted I think|pg||
nt|lesh: they play prec :)|pg||
nt|ady: south might compete with 3@C    but not clear action|pg||
nt|Walddk12: Kokish?|pg||
mb|p|nt|rigas_karo: it is safe to bid once again but |pg||
nt|rnmalik: very tempting:)|pg||
nt|mamos: good pressure from South|pg||
nt|othered1: Bye, Udo.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i choose 3@h cue here|pg||
nt|chick: right, 3@C is a better bid|pg||
nt|lechcold: basketball|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: ahh true|pg||
mb|2S|nt|collins64: if Mike bid 4@d, Isabelle 4@h they'll play 6@d|pg||
nt|eweber: if anyone of the players|pg||
nt|yuval10: not everyone's X perhaps|pg||
nt|ady: this might cause Irland to get too high|pg||
nt|jkotor: jak w dobrych juniorskich czasach :)|pg||
nt|koksoy: 5@D  veya  4@H  iyi  kontratlar  bizim  4@S  de  iyi  baraj...  5@D  oynayacaklar  sanýrým|pg||
nt|suketbombi: even @H in isolation will allow to make if the 1st @S is ducked|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Icelnad bid 3Nt on bd 7|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 3@D is Rubinsol trf to @Hs i Suppose|pg||
mb|p|nt|rigas_karo: 4@d or 4NT?|pg||
nt|roswolf: the boards have been swingy - Italy - slovakia 46-0 after 4 boards shows how|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Vul, not for the fainthearted!|pg||
nt|mamos: at least a couple off|pg||
nt|cameron_1: but flat vs. 3@s so|pg||
nt|cameron_1: flatish|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes but N takes the firsst @D trick|pg||
nt|MolvaM: good stop|pg||
nt|andreasw:  first|pg||
nt|xenya: no slam now -- just collecting your money i think...|pg||
nt|lechcold: 2BA naci¹gane|pg||
nt|james_h: Penos in South Africa ...|pg||
nt|oleberg: 2@H = 3 spades and a good raise. Normally not a gameforcing hand|pg||
nt|funtay: 6. brd 13 bize:)|pg||
mb|2N|nt|andersk: opps|pg||
nt|andersk: cold 4 @H|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 4@H +1|pg||
nt|athene: not sure i like unusual 2nt with 6@D4@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: :)|pg||
nt|athene: partner usually bids clubs with equal length which isn't at all what you want|pg||
nt|athene: notice how south can't bid stayman intending 2@S (sign-off) over 2@D|pg||
nt|athene: they obviously play that as something cunning|pg||
nt|athene: we have seen they have lots of relay auctions after stayman so you do lose the ability to bid it on rubbish hands|pg||
nt|shevek: 8 declarer made 3N and 8 went down|pg||
nt|shevek: declarers|pg||
nt|MolvaM: so it must have been a 50% contract :)|pg||
nt|shevek: true, needs accurate defence|pg||
nt|shevek: lol  murat|pg||
nt|xenya: or... who knows?|pg||
nt|lesh: he has to guess Q@d now, but it is difficult and probably -2|pg||
nt|hawe45:  300 avec le bon flanc - mais tout normale|pg||
nt|mdgraham: understandable auction, but the cards do not lie well|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: Ole I would love to play Ghana tat would mean we are in the final :)|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 2@H = is new for me nice |pg||
nt|oleberg: "To play Ghana" sounds like something that could be illegal (or prohibited to minors)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: coffee time|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A very sound contract on this lie|pg||
nt|mdgraham: heavy 1NT overcall, but you don't really want to pass at this vulnerability|pg||
nt|yusufb: 6 bordda 53 imp baya fazla|pg||
nt|ozgull: eller ona uygun tüm maçlar imp kaynýyor|pg||
nt|corplaw: easy 3N|pg||
nt|skaftij:  likely 10 imps to Iceland|pg||
nt|Walddk12: Glaub ich schon|pg||
nt|j li: 2@H zeigt 19-20 ausgeglichen|pg||
mb|p|nt|pitiful:  some play middle encourages and high or low sp in this situation|pg||
nt|shevek: to be fair some went down in 6@d :)|pg||
nt|petergill: Found it http://www.worldbridge1.org/bulletin/06_2%20Piestany/pdf/pairs/bul_04.pdf there are 2 photos of Cecilia. Interesting that the Poles who ran 2nd to them in the 2006 World ...|pg||
nt|petergill: Junior Pairs are near the top of the datums in the Open here in Ostend|pg||
nt|ralfwil: was N opening 1@h? 5+ |pg||
nt|skaftij:  Haraldsson opened 15-17 NT in 4th seat on his good 14 count|pg||
mb|3S|nt|collins64: he made the wrong choice|pg||
nt|boyklas: all the problems comes here for S because he doesnt know the H or the C Quebid|pg||
nt|boyklas: and he make go down even a 5D|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: at least the did well to avoid 6NT :)|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: 5@d by North is safe|pg||
nt|collins64: Belgium is back after the previous deal|pg||
nt|collins64: Dehaye weak NT forced them to play 4@h for one down|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: very weak NT :)|pg||
nt|boyklas: Manolis choosed to play at the 5-3 fit and not at the 4-4, firstly was thinking that he is playing at th 5-4 fit|pg||
nt|collins64: the bidding was 1NT 8-11 Pass 3@c X and he bid 4@h with his 5-card Q@h and his 4-card 8@s|pg||
nt|ady: they might make this  getting 3 diamond tricks|pg||
nt|lesh: A@s and @d switch|pg||
nt|h_karluk: straightforward play also possible|pg||
nt|chick: against the odds to drop the @DQ, but W may lead trump now to protect against a spade ruff|pg||
nt|barnets: Hacketts stopped in 4@S|pg||
nt|bagman: The hands do not fit well|pg||
nt|barnets: after a couple of slam tries|pg||
nt|barnets: on board 6|pg||
nt|brolucius: Countries in certain parts of the globe get a 'free pass' into the Bermuda Bowl. It is much more difficult if you are a European country.|pg||
nt|barnets: Holland have afree pass|pg||
nt|barnets: being the host country|pg||
nt|barnets: next year|pg||
nt|cumino: Good lead here K@H|pg||
nt|udo: und 3 @S zeigt 5er@S 4er@h ?|pg||
nt|j li: Das gibt die Konventionskarte nicht her|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: perhaps he should have signalled for a heart|pg||
nt|aldek: and now @DQ|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer is afraid to duck|pg||
nt|yusufb: pas yada 5@d|pg||
nt|koksoy: 6  nolu  boardda  Kuranoglu  4@S  i  gercekten  sýk  oynamýs|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes|pg||
mb|4H|nt|collins64: did he actually play the K@h|pg||
nt|boyklas: i dont think so.|pg||
nt|andersk: probably @H 9 lead|pg||
nt|rnmalik: suit worth bidding is worth leading.:)|pg||
nt|haans: most would say "thats not fair"|pg||
nt|davidb: should make on the  D suit |pg||
nt|athene: if north has a pretty good penalty pass here unless he thinks the double is really really offensive|pg||
nt|santyclz: The "DNPA" (does not promise anything) stayman has a lot going for it, but gives up a lot on big hands.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Entame atout - et bonne chance...|pg||
nt|haans: @H to ace to avoid @S ruff|pg||
nt|jkotor: nasi tu 1ba graj¹|pg||
nt|lechcold: 3BA te¿ naci¹gane:) i rezultat bêdzie chyba adekwatny|pg||

nt|udo: nahezu unmögliches Ausspiel|pg||
mb|p|nt|rigas_karo: strange|pg||
nt|andersk: should make now|pg||
nt|paulhac:  And the other room is 2 boards ahead|pg||
nt|andersk: the famous "almost 1k"  +990|pg||
nt|roswolf: i am told gib says the game can make -in practice i am confident it wont|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Sorry - trump lead - and good luck, I meant|pg||
nt|star6ija: 8+points, 5+@hs|pg||
nt|chick: OR, E could make a brilliant overtake of the spades and lead a trump :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: if ther declarer decided to play straightforward that doesn't make a sense|pg||
nt|chick: unfortunately, that gives away the location of the @DQ, so S might just try for the drop now|pg||
nt|h_karluk: *the|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: so even faster there|pg||
nt|ady: problem is the tap with the clubs|pg||
nt|star6ija: :)|pg||
nt|haans: claiming time|pg||
nt|lesh: well East is forced to switch to @d, having or no @d|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: I assumed opener had at least the Q for the 2@h opener - sry :>|pg||
nt|james_h: NS play control responces to 1@c?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: Although playing safe after the double 4 is the probable outcome|pg||

nt|othered1: Their doubles show extras, I believe.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They prefer to use double for something else. One can survive without support doubles you know|pg||
nt|tomi2:  eas has @CAQ in their opened suit, @DA, @SQ and partner made a constructive call vulnerable|pg||

nt|brolucius: Bowl and Venice Cup.|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer can make with high cross ruff, if the defense takes the heart ruff|pg||
nt|barnets: that is why the european championships are one of the toughest tests in the whole of bridge|pg||

nt|odysseus69: 2nd tie break for Murray|pg||

nt|bagman: Yes, that would have meant N winning with the A from AQ 7th|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 1H is 11-13 with 3 hearts|pg||
nt|brolucius: 1@H shows three hearts and is often played as forcing.|pg||
mb|4S|nt|rnmalik: support X.|pg||
nt|Walddk12: There is a legitimate line. Bocchi did not find it, but the defence erred|pg||
nt|MolvaM: a very terminologic approach shevek :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i bet with a constructive hand Vladimir would be able to give much tempting calls|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And I can reveal that the white cliffs of Dover are not white|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: 1@H mostly bal |pg||
nt|roswolf: well in the heat of battle anything can happen|pg||
nt|xenya: i think EW have said all they had to say -- now it's NS's turn|pg||
nt|snetram:  pewnie teraz 5 trefli cue bid|pg||
nt|jkotor: stwierdz¹ brak CB karo i 5@s jeszcze chodzi|pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: Ale 5@S idzie...|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: assuming no miracle recovery - austria now require denmark or portugal to lose heavily and they may scrap thru|pg||
nt|justin c: another slam here|pg||
nt|bagman: A lucky slam here but it is likely that EW stay in 3NT|pg||
nt|andreasw:  another swing for Bulgaria... game made board 7|pg||
mb|p|nt|eweber: this may have been another 2 Imps for NL|pg||
nt|athene: just because opps don't have game values between them doesn't mean they can't crucify you at the 3-level|pg||
nt|lesh: an easy -1 |pg||
nt|koksoy: 2@H de  kalacagýz|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: poles toughts us this|pg||
nt|pitiful:  not many would not want to show that @h suit|pg||
nt|xenya: but pass by S looks clear now|pg||
nt|brolucius: Attitude leads against NT, so the low club shows a suit that will be worth pursuing.|pg||
nt|othered1: would south have taken the same line without the double, which pretty strongly put the @CQ offside?.|pg||
nt|lesh: @c switch is not that difficult|pg||
nt|lesh: or playing small :)|pg||
nt|justin c: several of them, truth to tell|pg||
nt|brolucius: Oh, they play it as limited. Well, David Greenwood told me a few days ago that he treats it as 99% forcing. |pg||
nt|Walddk2: grey-ish rather|pg||
nt|odysseus69: there is a law in Scotland known as Leckies Law - if opponents are happy to defend 1D on this auction - GET OUT|pg||
nt|yusufb: 2@d 2@h diyen elin iyisi|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 3@C is pretty ok here 2@S a@D and a@C to loose|pg||
nt|ady: yes    Israel have competed well|pg||
nt|riccho: Andreas kennt aber auch Gro und weiß, dass die 4er UF noch nicht in Stein festgemeißelt ist|pg||
pc|c2|nt|babs59: What did you do to them Roland?|pg||
nt|bagman: The auction looks like Puppet Stayman 3@D promising one major and 3@H promising spades|pg||
pc|c5|nt|peachy: 1H showed spades|pg||
nt|ziff:  This could be tricky...|pg||
pc|c9|nt|boyklas: long suit game try, and accept with 4-3-3-3|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 1S is transfer to 1NT perhaps|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|pitiful:  maybe 4@h would not be natural for n-s|pg||
nt|aldek: nastepna glupota Brinka, ale ta przezyl|pg||
nt|james_h: I'm hoping for 6@d |pg||
nt|james_h: I could 6n|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: this is rigid once the @CQ pops declarer will be happy|pg||
nt|petergill: so 1NT rebid 15-17 and 2@D GF checkback with 2@H = three hearts|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East getting the character of her hand across with 1NT. Not much of a diamond stop, but anything else would be a distortion  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: painted them, perhaps?|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer has 9 top tricks in high cards and all suits stopped. He should play diamonds for 5 tricks|pg||
pc|d5|nt|santyclz: It's particularly unsafe to balance when the opponents haven't shown a fit.|pg||
nt|tomi2:  I am just thinking about how the play went, if GromÃ¶ller ducked @DA two times|pg||
nt|hawe45:  moins un|pg||
nt|justin c: either @C in West, or @H3-3,or @HJx etc|pg||
pc|d8|nt|haans: do not believe in 4@S|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 3NT, 5@C,2@D, 2@S losing 4 @H|pg||
nt|pitiful:  I am informed possibly a slam try in @s|pg||
nt|jkotor: jeli graj¹ otwarcie 4@s na -3 to tu tylko lewa wiêcej|pg||

nt|barnets: west has to avoid leading his long suit V 3N|pg||
nt|brolucius: They are certainly bidding round the houses. Let's hope that they end in the right place.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: eventually 3NT|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|rigas_karo: this is not making...|pg||
nt|petergill: Susan Stockdale is very disciplined about taking her time at Trick 1 to study the hand fully before committing herself to any play|pg||
nt|petergill: This is a very good habit to have|pg||
nt|barnets: r he gives dec his 9th trick|pg||
nt|andreasw:  He will|pg||
nt|bagman: Instead of playing diamond to ace and 8 back with intention to run it|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|haans: relays flipping out|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: good bridge by both teams |pg||
nt|justin c: very good contract|pg||

nt|tomi2:  Wladow revoked?|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 3/2 a litle move by Sweden |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jameslee 2: let,s se how the 800 finishes starting bidding of the hand other room|pg||
nt|marlowepi: heureusement pour Mari, E peut contribuer la dame de K, sinon entame K serait peu confortable|pg||
nt|brolucius: Obvious what to lead after that bidding...|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|Walddk12: It wasn't for the Italians after the same start. Bocchi bid 4@H, 5@D by Madala and 6@H|pg||
nt|barnets: a diamond ?|pg||
nt|cumino: Diamond beats |pg||
nt|bagman: Madala's going to lead a spade and Bocchi's going to play the @SQ|pg||
nt|koksoy: burada  @H  overcallundan  sonra   dbl=  en az  4 tane  pik  demek....  1S  deseydi  =  cevap  verecek  kadar puan va ancak  4lü  pik  yok  demekti|pg||
pc|s2|nt|boyklas: if he had not take the D he would have made it|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: double @C finesse is 75% or so - playing on hearts is 36% 3/3 or 50% abit better if u cash the @HA ... so claerly clubs best line|pg||
nt|odysseus69: need to know what they said about 3S bid|pg||
nt|barnets: wow amazing|pg||
nt|bagman: well done by Madala|pg||
nt|brolucius: Too good.|pg||
nt|bagman: Might 3@S mean solid spade stopper and not so solid diamond stopper?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: I suspect that 3 spades showed good stop|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|j li: Die Gegenspieler sind zu scharf auf ihre Schnapper|pg||
pc|sK|nt|haans: :(|pg||
nt|petergill: I lost to Fiona and Susan at the NEC Cup in Japan earlier this year - I know their style quite well|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Gold must have showed concern about either diamonds or spades|pg||
nt|bagman: Now unlikely to try to steal the @SK|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|andersk: many tables have been playing 4@HX +1 for 990 on  9|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: 50% inteding to finesse the @ht|pg||
nt|justin c: guess you run the @CJ, and if that loses test @H, and if nothing good there, run the @C10|pg||
nt|riccho: hab ich auch grad dran gedacht|pg||
pc|d6|nt|collins64: other Room 3NT on deal 9|pg||
nt|andersk: maybe South switch small @D|pg||
nt|ziff:  If I understood our operator right he played two cards to the same trick|pg||
nt|MolvaM: maybe ducking would have been better|pg||
nt|barnets: murray won set 2|pg||
nt|brolucius: Perhaps a quicker auction would have given fewer clues.|pg||
nt|motu: karo nach sollte noch reichen|pg||
pc|s6|nt|lmeili: do u like N's "double" ? here|pg||
nt|haans: no @D loser|pg||
pc|d9|nt|rigas_karo: i think only 8 tricks even if the ducks the @d|pg||
nt|wygbe1: i need to go, its late here - thx all, gnite, enjoy the match|pg||
nt|athene: well a boring 4major+1 is just what EW need to get back on track after that last board|pg||
nt|fokal: indeed|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|collins64: after 1@d 2@d |pg||
nt|Walddk2: What is West supposed to do, Victor, redouble?|pg||
nt|suketbombi: Zack has taken that gamble as 3@C cud have come with 5 cards too|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|nt|rnmalik: After the first @H you mean.|pg||
nt|peachy: Thanks Jim, enjoyed! G nite|pg||
nt|star6ija: happyend|pg||
nt|brolucius: Will need to look at that one again, Thomas. You are right that he needs to get to the South hand to draw the last trump and a diamond hold-up may be helpful.|pg||
nt|tomi2:  then duck the club later|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 1 set all - murrayv Tsonga|pg||
nt|riccho: haarscharf das Ganze. |pg||
pc|s3|nt|mcarroll: Surely not|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I mean not playing @SQ?|pg||
nt|haans: Operator Who are the swedish players?|pg||
nt|haans: 2nd opinion: Peacokk: E upmark|pg||
nt|haans: @H5|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|tomi2:  had no other intelligent bid|pg||
nt|mdgraham: may be out for 800 - not so bad with 4@H on NS|pg||
nt|yusufb: kendi rengimize transfer etmek burdaki 2@d gibi|pg||
nt|j li: es droht ein dritter Trumpfstich für die Defense|pg||
pc|d3|nt|boyklas: yes sorry|pg||
pc|dT|nt|paulhac:  Goodnight Jim|pg||
nt|bagman: Now Madala knows how to defend with the setting trick in his own hand|pg||
nt|babs59: East is relieved to get the spade trick, bonus|pg||
nt|odysseus69: yes xx on this - pass not allowed |pg||
pc|s9|nt|haans: sloppy|pg||
nt|tomi2:  maybe he can make versace believe @CQ is onside and use spade as entry to hand|pg||
nt|tomi2:  but versace had @CT8, so he could have played the clubs starting with the 8 then without losing communication|pg||
nt|brolucius: Worth another look, you are right. Easier on Deep Finesse.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If S had followed with @hQ on @hK.....|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer still has only 7 tricks ready made|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Pekka I thnk you called it right|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|roswolf: a huge swing on bd6 to ireland when the israelis lost 800 in 5@CX|pg||
nt|ady: board 6 Ireland gain 14 imps    when Israel went down in 4 spades with 2 heart ruffs    the Israel South came in at the 5 level with clubs when Ireland reached 4 spades|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: going for a squeeze - 4@h + the @cK|pg||
nt|barnets: really fine lead by madala --not sure how he worked it out|pg||
pc|cK|nt|cameron_1: good methods so logn as you never want to bid @h|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: is he down ?|pg||
nt|eamongall: down where ? |pg||
nt|james_h: its about an 80% contract|pg||
pc|c3|nt|lmeili: 3N sounds a good contract, needs @d K on side |pg||
nt|bagman: he might try a heart to the 7 for 8th trick|pg||
pc|s4|nt|boyklas: why not claim?|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: ohh noo nm|pg||
nt|james_h: when clubs 4-1 off side, you can finesse the @h 10|pg||
nt|eamongall: 12 tricks yeah |pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: it turned out to be a decision to pass with north's hand|pg||
nt|Gerben42: perhaps if the operator has time he can enter the missing result|pg||
nt|justin c: more like 90% I imagine|pg||
pc|hA|nt|andersk: btw, I like the 2 Nt bid from Charlie|pg||
nt|rnmalik: With Q@C and P promising 6+@C, good bid.|pg||
nt|andersk: thinking about if he wants to hook the @C?|pg||
nt|petergill: Brilliant idea, Ralf|pg||

nt|benjent: Was the @dA all by it's lonesome, or did it have a little brother? Ruff high or not?|pg||

nt|petergill: @D2 = "reverse suit preference"|pg||
nt|petergill: West cannot get East in|pg||
nt|petergill: North's jamming 4@H call was a good bid, convincing EW not to try 4@S|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed, especially since 4@s would actually make on a heart lead|pg||
nt|petergill: With NS playing a limited opening system (11H 11-16), 4@H might also have been bid on a balanced 14 count, making 4@S by East quite dangerous|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@H 11-16|pg||
nt|dburn: declarer contemplating playing ace and another heart, to avoid a possible club ruff|pg||
nt|petergill: Picture and bridge results of Fiona Brown at http://worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=23541|pg||

nt|eamongall: I think we should have John Comyn in here for a last hurrah |pg||
nt|james_h: I demand that John be ungaged|pg||
nt|james_h: we need John right now|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: right then like cricket Ireland need to score roughly 7+ imps every board from now on .. np !!|pg||
nt|eamongall: Roland is not around |pg||
nt|eamongall: have we got any Austrian commentator |pg||
nt|skaftij:  8 trick limit in NT|pg||

nt|star6ija: NS|pg||
nt|andreasw:  not at all|pg||
nt|xenya: but 4@H should be easy|pg||
nt|eamongall: I remember reading in books 25 years ago about Jan Fucik ...and he was not young then |pg||
nt|dburn: so this is not an easy problem for Rimstedt - although whatever she does will work|pg||
nt|bagman: He might take a spade finesse suggested by the X for take out|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|andersk: looks like the names have been corrected|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Is it true?:)|pg||
nt|mamos: lots of work|pg||
nt|pitiful:  DG will need to guess the trump suit|pg||
nt|mamos: that lead directing opening has resulted in the best lead|pg||
nt|pitiful:  yes a good effort by north|pg||
nt|pitiful:  some might pass the north hand surprisingly|pg||
nt|marlowepi: un bon contrat|pg||
pc|c2|nt|rnmalik: The contract I mean.|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: that's what I got from thr CR|pg||
nt|athene: if east suspects the 1@H is a psyche he can't be so sure about the diamond finesse|pg||
nt|shevek: I would pass every time|pg||
nt|brolucius: One heart loser goes on the @CA, so slam depends on picking up the trump. But no reason to think they will bid it.|pg||

nt|andersk: SVK- ITA 2-1|pg||
nt|andersk: 10 min left|pg||
nt|haans: i think he did not have a clue were @SJ was :)|pg||
nt|athene: but more likely it's just a shaded opener|pg||
nt|othered1: EW's card mentions "distributional asking relays," which may be in effect here.|pg||
nt|8252: oui, mais c'est les même levées à SA|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: board 10 North by not openning lost a @S = part score contract|pg||
nt|riccho: @s besser duecken im 1. Stich?|pg||
pc|c8|nt|boyklas: he may play well the S, if he play small to the A and see the KS drops he can play small to T now the JXX cant be played|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|Gerben42: making many tricks|pg||
nt|shevek: at least!  :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: You might not get a heart lead.|pg||
nt|othered1: and east's cheapest bid style h ere surely looks like a relay auction.  Don't have translation,  however.|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 4@C= 10 tricks |pg||
nt|j li: egal, da Kirmse zwei Asse hat|pg||
pc|s5|nt|pitiful:  still if he did he would probably be on lead to 4@s anyway|pg||
nt|pitiful:  Gold would open Rolands favourite flannery|pg||

nt|jameslee 2: @H brake 3/3 will help him to get home|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @sA onside and @h not worse than 4-2 is enough|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: true clubs 2/2 helps but with clubs 3/1 also gets there with a @H play first|pg||
pc|d2|nt|tomi2:  I guess west showed 4 3 2 4 :)|pg||
nt|chick: W could have overcalled 1N and been first :)|pg||

nt|tomi2:  ending up as dummy in 2@D, not the contract he was dreaming of|pg||
nt|athene: i am not sure where they went wrong but clearly a wheel came off somewhere|pg||
nt|pitiful:  another lead directing bid|pg||

nt|8252: mais il vaut mieux soit qua ça marche, soit avoir des partenaires compréhensifs et doux|pg||
mb|p|nt|andersk: Est overcalled 1 @S in open room, and South 2 @S, quite strange bidding, anyway NOrway playing 5 NT in open room|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Looks like 4@H should make|pg||
nt|tomi2:  Wladow knows about partnes @C qualitiy, so he won't lead a club now ;)|pg||

nt|james_h: this might get interesting but I doubt it|pg||
nt|eamongall: ah yeah pass 1@S |pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 11: At the other table, South opened 1NT, West bid 2@C single suiter  and EW never found out what suit it was, so NS ended up in 4@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|andersk: 2-2|pg||
nt|andersk: no|pg||
nt|andersk: offside|pg||
nt|andersk: incredible match on TV too:)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 6@d may have communication problems.... between parters :)|pg||
nt|lesh: probably 1nt was 3 suits and that's why North decided to pass over 3@d|pg||
nt|lesh: and possible 5@c bid by West now if 1nt is what we suppose to mean|pg||
nt|petergill: something to be said for: calling a spade a spade, perhaps|pg||
nt|ralfwil: close to 6nt|pg||
nt|mdgraham: or even Two Spades|pg||
nt|petergill: yes|pg||
nt|petergill: Susan Stockdale knows that her @DK should be huge, being in partner's suit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: raise to 4NT?|pg||
nt|petergill: I think she will bid 4NT quantitative|pg||
nt|ralfwil: perhaps 4nt from W|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: nice fight by W = 5@C |pg||
nt|oleberg: 5@C is a nice save, -300|pg||
nt|corplaw: EW should bid and make 4H|pg||

nt|skaftij:  East's bid showing majors will help|pg||
nt|suketbombi: away|pg||
nt|ady: will need to get 3 heart tricks and block the diamond suit if their is a switch by playing low|pg||
nt|ady: will need to play a low heart from ssouth |pg||
nt|riccho: 1@h = TRF |pg||
mb|p|nt|eweber: but still, with 210 and 170 on my score card I wouldn't feel to good, it may not cost but surely won't bring in...|pg||
nt|andersk: even more exsiteing then bbo|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT hopless if they lead hearts   |pg||
nt|andreasw:  lol|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: dangerous reopenning here |pg||
nt|psridhar: thin 4s for EW , a lucky make -but imposs to get there unless pushed|pg||
nt|haans: but most of us would|pg||
nt|psridhar: South does have a good hand, cant fault him for reopening|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: what will North try to bid ?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think a similar example was in one of Ian Fleming's 007 JB books|pg||
nt|h_karluk: trappy sample|pg||
nt|lesh: I dont think North will pass|pg||
nt|lesh: South has showed 0-5 and 6+ spades but ...|pg||
nt|chick: N's hand is far too good|pg||
nt|chick: almost slam in hand|pg||
nt|lesh: 4@h is making|pg||
nt|chick: only problem is ... can he overcome his fear of 4-1 or 4-2 trump split in a red suit|pg||
nt|petergill: and then Fiona will probably pass, wanting one more diamond or one more highish card anywhere for 6NT|pg||
nt|ralfwil: With these two guys, you must be fast on the keyboard|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 4@S=620|pg||
nt|oleberg: If he gets diamonds right, which he will.|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 5@C=300 or 500|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Crikey, free lesson in Turkish|pg||
nt|mdgraham: is it really necessary to get to 2NT with the EW cards?|pg||

nt|jkmjanusz: Pani Agato! |pg||
nt|petergill: Fiona will like @D10, bulking up her long suit|pg||
nt|bagman: 2@S might be a start of a short suit trial|pg||
mb|p|nt|rigas_karo: maybe he thought declarer hand 6421|pg||
nt|andersk: same lead as open room, probably 11 and a push|pg||
nt|Gerben42: you never know yesterday I saw Greco Hampson making 3N on 11 vs 10|pg||
nt|peachy: somebody took a long time, I assume|pg||
nt|roswolf: looks very possible|pg||
nt|shevek: they had some intervention by west who showed the blacks, still....|pg||
nt|dburn: quite a lot may depend on the lead to 6NT - @c10 (or@c9 depending on methods) will not work well|pg||
nt|dburn: but this is dangerous|pg||
nt|petergill: Ralf, or you will be burned ... am I still allowed to commentate after that?  |pg||
nt|ralfwil: :)|pg||
nt|petergill: 6@C, in case West has 5 clubs|pg||
nt|dburn: although West probably ought to convert to 6NT...|pg||
nt|petergill: A conversion to 6NT would avoid the nasty 5-1 split|pg||
nt|petergill: With 4 clubs, East might have proceeded via "fourth suit forcing"|pg||

nt|lesh: dangerous call|pg||
nt|chick: "pick another suit"|pg||
nt|lesh: he can even make 5@d|pg||
nt|lesh: 4@h and 5@d making but 3nt not |pg||

nt|jameslee 2: nice bid West|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: here is an example of a Vulnerable position safe for E-W|pg||
nt|brolucius: Not the sort of deal where you want to be playing against Italy...|pg||
nt|odysseus69: we are watching a Bocchi special- sadly I can offer no explanation|pg||
nt|bagman: 7@D here is a good contract|pg||
nt|Walddk2: How can you expect West to bid any less?|pg||
nt|bagman: or maybe not|pg||
nt|suketbombi: finnese|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|paulhac:  E/wWhave done well to hold the loss to 5 Imps|pg||

nt|babs59: The chat about Scottish inventions had me googling additional Australian inventions.  I thought I needed to check facts |pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|collins64: just talk about why playing A@c on that 1st round|pg||
nt|boyklas: its possible|pg||
nt|ady: kib asking again for link to running scores please|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm not the expected lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/runningscores/asp/roundteamsconditstatclassicmod.asp?qtournid=817&qshowflag=1|pg||
nt|pitiful:  well this is not very interesting|pg||
nt|pitiful:  @c lead best|pg||
nt|lesh: opps 3nt also makes:) He has the entry for @d finess|pg||
nt|lesh: he can but it is impossible to bid|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i whispered he could pass to 3NX but seems was busy a lot and did not hear me|pg||
nt|chick: entry for @D finesse is a problem|pg||
nt|chick: and 6@C EW is makeable too, I think|pg||
nt|lesh: slams are makeable but it is diffucult to reach. |pg||
nt|chick: I dunno, I'd still keep trying to reach a red slam with N's hand|pg||
nt|lesh: from the bidding you know what 4@h are 4-1 at least and there is 4th @d in West|pg||
nt|chick: yes, that's what is scaring N into serious caution|pg||
nt|lesh: your partner is 0-5 points with 6+ spades|pg||
nt|lesh: you dont expect him have K@hxx and 109x in @d|pg||
nt|chick: and nothing wasted in @Ss :)|pg||
nt|aldek: ale konsekwentne|pg||

nt|yusufb: alýp @s pas atarsa 2-3 batar|pg||
nt|ozgull: pik empasý atýp fazla fazla batacak|pg||
nt|corplaw: now can make 5 on that lead|pg||
nt|suketbombi: well done|pg||
pc|s6|nt|star6ija: still some communication problems|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: problems are arriving for N-S |pg||
nt|psridhar: but 3C x is painful all the same|pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: Przepraszam...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, that's avoided the 5-1 trump break |pg||
nt|dburn: good decision - now all East has to do is make it|pg||
nt|petergill: Good decision by Susan, but can 6NT be made?|pg||
nt|Walddk7: It can|pg||
nt|dburn: North will probably be squeezed in the majors even if East does not pick the clubs|pg||
nt|dburn: but on this auction South is not all that likely to lead the suit|pg||
nt|ralfwil: N is squeezed in majors|pg||
nt|Walddk7: She can get four club tricks by force|pg||
nt|petergill: South has to lead - what? - something ... the hearts and spades lie over West's holdings, reducing squeeze possibilities|pg||
nt|ralfwil: A squeese in more fun than a double finess:)|pg||
nt|Walddk7: If she is inspired and trust that @CJ is a singleton she has four tricks in the suit. The rest will come from diamonds|pg||
nt|petergill: East's 3rd heart might be a vital threat in this hand which even Fiona, usually a fast but careful player, will take a long time to play, surely|pg||
nt|Walddk7: She has just enough entries for all that|pg||
nt|dburn: but if South chooses the queen of hearts (which is dangerous), East may well go astray|pg||
nt|petergill: Sandra Rimstedt can hardly lead a club after this bidding, or will she?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: @HQ is a bit of a Flash Harry sort of lead|pg||
nt|ralfwil: When E can see a 5-card @c and a 4-card @d the squeeze is easy|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: always remember to make actions depending on the vul position |pg||
nt|barnets: and 7@H|pg||
nt|odysseus69: however many will open on West|pg||
pc|s9|nt|collins64: no Mike show count on J@d lead 7 cards so not possible |pg||
nt|MolvaM: to protect the @cQ and against bad breaks,|pg||
nt|justin c: looks like 5 losers here|pg||
nt|petergill: A low club lead is safe into the expected 4-3 fit - either partner has a bare @C honour or she does not|pg||
nt|Walddk7: That will likely give the show away|pg||
nt|dburn: well, that's a safe club to lead - declarer probably won't take four club tricks now|pg||
nt|petergill: NS lead 3rd and 5th versus both NT and suit|pg||
nt|Walddk7: I think she will, they lead 5th|pg||
nt|Walddk7: That's what I meant by giving the show away|pg||
nt|dburn: yes, but they also lead third - it would be a little vexing to lose to @cJ109 or the like with North|pg||
nt|petergill: A club lead from a 3 or 4 card holding is unlikely (being risky, might pick up partner's queen) on the bidding|pg||
nt|dburn: well, declarer lost her way at the other table, so this is a big chance for Fiona Brown|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: here is ths most advantaje Vulnerable position for a pair Non Vul - Vul = we are clear advantaje never hesitate to fight 1 more |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: remember te only bad safe is when you are getting paid 1 don and you decided to defend |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 1 down |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: as you can see West has no key cards to fight againtx 4@S|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|ady: got of to a bad lead    but still defence can recover  South will need to play a low heart when in with A@S   and north will have to read the position|pg||
nt|star6ija: decided by the defense|pg||
nt|andreasw:  Magnusson in control here and chose 6@h|pg||
nt|tomi2:  if he exited with a heart, Versace could have won the Jack and give partner a @D ruff to "get back" the 2 imps Kirmse was working for, but we don't know the cards exactly|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: so good 5@C|pg||
nt|corplaw: QS more sensible|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|roswolf: the lead was i think another sols flight of fancy|pg||
nt|shevek: good choice|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes had Mag bid a cue Harald would bid 6@d and Mag had to make a choise|pg||
nt|andreasw:  after 4nt from harald ofcourse|pg||
nt|MolvaM: spade lead?|pg||
nt|andreasw:  small @h lead but could cost the beating trick|pg||
nt|MolvaM: and then another spade (when in with @hA) could create problems|pg||
nt|andreasw:  i would lead the @c|pg||
nt|MolvaM: declarer must refrain from cashing diamonds|pg||
nt|lesh: opps|pg||
nt|chick: N did well not to double :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: okay, if the input is correct now i belived much to that old saying in BG. "The wolf has a thick neck, because he does his job on his own. "|pg||
nt|skaftij:  not difficult, would plan to finesse for the 10 next round|pg||
nt|ady: home now     good board for Iceland|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mcarroll: :)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  worst lead would be @D|pg||
nt|lesh: that's better|pg||
nt|h_karluk: agreed|pg||

pc|d5|nt|eweber: y and board 10 was a good 16 opposite 8 here|pg||
nt|peachy: NS in the other room preempted themselves from 4H, it can happen|pg||
nt|bogier: 1100 kosztowa³oby chyba|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But there is also a double squeeze if S has only a 4-card @d, so correctplay is to win on dummy, and play on @d|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is East who should be able to count 13 tricks at the end.|pg||
nt|bagman: 7@H is easy to play, win the first trick and play @HA and heart to the T|pg||
nt|bagman: How would you play 7NT?|pg||
nt|bagman: I would go for double squeeze|pg||

nt|psridhar: Fredin may get his 800 'back' !|pg||
nt|petergill: Lucky it's not me who is declarer, I would take forever... . and I mean "forever" ... to play this hand|pg||
nt|bagman: with spades as the pivot suit|pg||
nt|corplaw: risks spade ruff, but then can pitch losing diamond on 4th spade to still make 4|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer is ready to give 2 trumps and a spade.|pg||
nt|bagman: Playing trumps would be dangerous as he could lose two trumps a spade and a diamond|pg||
nt|bagman: This guarantees the contract|pg||
nt|bagman: on the assumption that S has the @SJ|pg||
nt|corplaw: even if S led from Qx of spades, contract still guaranteed|pg||
nt|bagman: yes. Goes down only if the Q came from Q9x :9|pg||
nt|corplaw: Q from Q9x would be the master stroke :)|pg||
nt|corplaw: and even then only if KJx of hearts is offside|pg||

nt|MolvaM: no problem|pg||
nt|MolvaM: dummy has a high heart|pg||
nt|andreasw:  still makeable|pg||
nt|psridhar: now 1100 even|pg||
nt|tomi2:  Smirnov Piekarek found some great defense against 3NT in board 10|pg||
nt|bagman: 7@D is more a bidding problem than a play problem. With trumps breaking it's easy to take a heart ruff|pg||
nt|cumino: Spade lead board 10 in 3NT|pg||
nt|sastro: alles ausser @C|pg||
pc|h9|nt|Gerben42: also an option to pass 1@H, then reaching 3/4@H is likely|pg||
nt|andreasw:  but a nice try|pg||
nt|petergill: When North showed out in clubs, Fiona will smartly think about North having length in both majors and being squeezable|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Which is a certainty when she cashes @D10|pg||
nt|mdgraham: from the photos, I'd say that both North and South are - no, I'd better not |pg||
nt|odysseus69: Roland go go go - the Don comes to mind|pg||
pc|hK|nt|pitiful:  the Dutch stopped in 2@s and the twins competed to 3@c which was mercifully not doubled down 2|pg||
nt|eamongall: 13.5 miles |pg||
nt|babs59: and Mike - there are plenty of Aussie inventions :)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|rigas_karo: well defended|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|Gerben42: going down|pg||
nt|petergill: NS play upside down count, so Fiona is thinking that South has 4 @Ds and 5 @Cs|pg||
pc|d3|nt|collins64: Greece is back after deal 11|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: yes match can get close to a draw situation after hand nº 12 & 8 boards to play|pg||
nt|petergill: and not many major suit cards|pg||
nt|ralfwil: back on @sK|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Or cash @CK, then a heart|pg||
nt|petergill: If South is 3-1 in the majors, the timing to allow for both single and double squeeze possibilities is worth thinking about|pg||
nt|petergill: What to pitch from fummy on @d's is part of the problem|pg||
nt|petergill: @HQJ could be doubleton|pg||
nt|petergill: @S6 3rd and 5th - count-givers to the end|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @cK and a @s to @sk, @d10 and all is clear|pg||
nt|Walddk7: If Peter had been declarer, he would probably not have played to trick 1 yet|pg||
nt|petergill: Sandra Rimstedt and Emma Sjoberg play pro bridge at US Nationals, and do quite well there|pg||
nt|petergill: Roland is right|pg||
pc|d6|nt|odysseus69: the only question was how many bids it would take- actually I believe that many grnd slams are easier to bid than most small slams|pg||
nt|cumino: claim|pg||
pc|dA|nt|ralfwil: WD!|pg||
nt|barnets: match close now|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|Gerben42: so 100 is fine for NL|pg||
nt|pitiful:  declarer is possibly concerned that east has five @c's|pg||
nt|petergill: Nevena Senior found a good @H swtich at the other table, and then declarer chose to pitch a spade (not a club) from dummy, hoping for a @H and @c squeeze which did not eventuate|pg||

pc|h2|nt|Gerben42: this looks at least -1|pg||
nt|Walddk7: 1@H any 20+|pg||

pc|hA|nt|paulhac:  Now its all over|pg||
nt|tomi2:  he will be rewarded with friendly breaks all around except of hearts - the best knws he can get. but Smirnov made 4@H so there will ne no huge swing|pg||
nt|haans: different versions of walsh transfer in sweden we bid only 1nt with S hand|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: still a lot to say by both teams |pg||

nt|oleberg: Operator, are you sure Easts second bid was 2@H and not 2@D?|pg||
nt|sastro: gibt wenig zu spielen an der Hand|pg||
pc|h8|nt|pitiful:  6@C is a playable spot here|pg||

nt|babs59: we have a large street that was renamed Sir Donald Bradman Drive|pg||
nt|babs59: But my 6 degrees of separation is that his son bought the house I built|pg||
nt|suketbombi: a close match till bd 6 and Iceland have picked up 25+ imps since then|pg||
nt|skaftij:  @s switch best|pg||

pc|c3|nt|andersk: Italy is out of the world cup|pg||

nt|vasmar: good morning Yuval|pg||
nt|star6ija: I think they managed to play in same directions aiming to be shown on the Vugraph :)|pg||
nt|haans: 1@S to show 2 3 spade no extra|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2@C was forcing to game, so I suppose a 2@S continuation covers all the spade raises.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@H over 2@H would be a @H raise and @D shortness|pg||
nt|othered1: and with no side shortness?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Let me ask giammi|pg||
nt|8252: sans les @s, on a du mal aussi|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: 2 off for sure|pg||
nt|barnets: anyone see a twelfth trick in hearts ?|pg||
nt|brolucius: East known to have long clubs, so Townsend is suspicious of the @S8 switch and declines the finesse.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: well done - cant be bad|pg||
pc|cK|nt|Gerben42: now at least 2|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@S 0-4|pg||
nt|petergill: or balanced|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: fireworks =X 3nt by North |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: way tis X ?|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: somebody ?|pg||
nt|oleberg: X asked for a diamond-lead, dummy's suit|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: well he knows |pg||
nt|ozgull: natürel de gitse zor|pg||
nt|riccho: Schnitt und Cl|pg||
pc|c2|nt|eweber: while this one would only promise a swing if the open NS pair weren't playing strong NT, but they are|pg||
nt|ady: now 6 easy tricks    I am sure a 7th will come|pg||
nt|shevek: I'm told 2@s is 8-10 , 6@s|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: nice K@C helping card showing to secuence & giving parner a relax moment to tell him your lead made no damagge to defence|pg||
nt|marlowepi: meme cela revient a la chance:)|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 1- both opps are not strong |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 2- he has the @D controled |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 3-he has a lot of confidence |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 15/1 up|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 4- is not a part score not much dange on this x|pg||
nt|oleberg: Or at least the double shows, that diamonds is controlled, and south should be vary, leading from honours|pg||
nt|ralfwil: this lead makes that N can win the @d immediately and return another @s|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: tricks count |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: East |pg||
nt|oleberg: 3@D must have been invitational, so the double is "safe"|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 3@S+2@H+1@C=7 |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: he needs to develope the @D |pg||
nt|ralfwil: only 6 tricks from top, so let us see|pg||
nt|oleberg: the lead is a killer|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: sorry 6 yes |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: remember siesta time for Spanish people |pg||
nt|oleberg: This will always take at least 7 tricks, 6 obvious ones, and seventh cannot help but being devellopped|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: Siesta= good life in spain / relax moment and here we are fighting in this match :)|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|pitiful:  safe play by declarer|pg||
nt|mamos: making safe|pg||
nt|pitiful:  leaving trump in dummy to ruff @s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2NT= asking for min/max and distribution. Denies @S raise, may have @H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So they go through 2NT with a balanced heart raise|pg||
nt|riccho: eigentlich... |pg||
nt|motu: wenn man da kontriert wird weiss man nicht ob man drin bleiben soll oder lieber 3@C reizen sollte|pg||
pc|d9|nt|boyklas: 5C at boar 12|pg||
nt|rnmalik: would require some play.|pg||
nt|andersk: this contract is not makeable|pg||
nt|pitiful:  i saw symonds play the other night for Surrey|pg||
pc|d4|nt|haans: do not understand low spade|pg||
nt|Walddk7: At TGR they would probably play this in 3NT in order collect 150 honours|pg||
nt|petergill: This gives declarer an entry to dummy for the doomed trump finesse|pg||
nt|koksoy: 4@H  e  gerek  yoktu..  ancak  3@C  yaptýrýp  110  verecegimize  3@H +1 170  alsaydýk...|pg||
nt|ozgull: ama yinede bir partskor kaybý gibi|pg||
nt|ady: will need to play east for doubleton K@H|pg||
nt|j li: Aber 2@S verpflichtet direkt zur 3er Stufe|pg||
pc|d8|nt|boyklas: boar|pg||
nt|shevek: I think it also suggests shortage in @h|pg||
nt|chick: can make 6, but I predict only 5 ... will set up @Ds, they will knock out the other @S stopper, and he won't dare take the @H finesse|pg||
nt|petergill: Declarer has to misguess a lot in order to fail|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Welcome to Jaap Frijling|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|collins64: Mike 14 HCP opening is not going to run good here|pg||
nt|eweber: wow, another 11 for NL|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Spade lead looked normal|pg||
nt|athene: lauria-versace got some way towards 4@H - just not all the way|pg||
nt|pitiful:  you mentioned flash boys|pg||
nt|lesh: with doubleton Q@d and Q@c and @H finess working he can even make 12 tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That is an excellent switch, it will set up a club trick in time|pg||
pc|s3|nt|peachy: 3Nt was better since hearts 4-4, but one never knows|pg||
nt|chick: hmm, now he may have to take the @H finesse|pg||
nt|lesh: however,what is more important is to make your contract|pg||
nt|jkotor: lol, dosta³em na priv pytanie, |pg||
nt|cumino: if they don't lead @D|pg||
nt|suketbombi: cud aways guess the @HS to make the 8th on the @S switch asthe cards are but much easier now|pg||
pc|s6|nt|rnmalik: cannot rule out an error by the defense.|pg||
nt|eweber: 26:4 now|pg||
nt|MolvaM: the iceland pairs doing extremely well in the event|pg||
nt|jaapfr: hoi Roland et all:)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|MolvaM: one pair ranked 1st in butler with 1,66 imp/board|pg||
nt|MolvaM: other 2 pairs also high with 0,84 and 0,3 plus|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 1,66 imp average over 100 boards is phenomenal|pg||
nt|xenya: well at least it served as a lead director|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 9@D a very strong card in N|pg||
nt|bagman: Surprise @CA|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|Gerben42: thanks to the 3@S opener|pg||
nt|bagman: The defense can get 800 if they make no mistake. Often a trick is dropped|pg||
nt|bagman: and declarer escapes with -500|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Oh well, not when West did not win the first diamond|pg||
nt|koksoy: 2@D  ya  kontur   nedir ?  diger  renkler  ??    yoksa  karolarmý  ??... |pg||
nt|yusufb: 1@c pas 1@s 2@c olursa N eli 2@h diye uyandýrabilir|pg||
nt|skaftij:  disagree|pg||
nt|skaftij:  or..|pg||
pc|s9|nt|boyklas: Dehaye didnt find the S lead so again some imps for greece|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 8 tricks|pg||
nt|petergill: Their system wrongsided the hand - "calling a spade a spade" works a bit better on this hand|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 800?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Some players drop fewer tricks than others.|pg||
pc|s8|nt|h_karluk: yesterday i was in Florence SC, USA sectional, a young lady offered me for an interview to their local TV channel. Her question was "what's the best thing in this game". I think ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 'try to improve your judgement skills' was a fair answer.|pg||
nt|petergill: OK now|pg||
nt|bagman: These guys here drop fewer but even they drop tricks in defense|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Then the suit would be blocked and no entry to @DJ|pg||
pc|s4|nt|Gerben42: 3NT is a claimer|pg||
nt|roswolf: israel made 4@S ON 9 BUT had some opp bidding to help them|pg||
nt|shevek: iceland lost their 1st match to italy (14-16)|pg||
nt|shevek: after that won 10 in a row|pg||
nt|andreasw:  must have been a good match|pg||
nt|petergill: EW lead 2nd and 4th |pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|Gerben42: looks they finally start scoring|pg||
nt|eweber: right, over 2@s life is so much easier!|pg||
nt|peachy: yes indeed it did, having stuff in all other suits|pg||
nt|othered1: ty|pg||
nt|othered1: lost of possible variations here, including a cross-ruff with thos good trump spots|pg||
nt|skaftij:  if esat does not cover @h J, west gets in to play 3rd @s|pg||
pc|cA|nt|rigas_karo: discrding the diamond costs a trick, -1 now|pg||
nt|lmeili: E ll be squeezed|pg||
nt|andersk: 3-2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The operation was successful, but .....|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now it may even make|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Lauria has a feeling that hearts are 5-1, so I think he will make it from here|pg||
nt|odysseus69: dont fancy him|pg||
nt|mdgraham: (it was 99.94, not 99.6. Sorry)|pg||
pc|c7|nt|lmeili: not now|pg||
nt|andersk: OMG|pg||
nt|xenya: only 10 tricks now -- in the other room, i think, a spade was led|pg||
nt|oleberg: Declarer might be banking South having no diamonds, since he didn't lead one|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: going for the @H gives him te 7t trick |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: looks like |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 500 |pg||
nt|ralfwil: a @c back and @s10|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: -2 x = 500 for Iceland trying to do a comeback |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: any back excepto te J@S|pg||
nt|ralfwil: N will know a lot about Easts distribution 4522|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and also S|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and better @c to @cQ and another @c|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer was hoping to set up two club tricks assuming the AK onside|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mcarroll: 3-=2!!!|pg||
nt|andersk: stil 1,5 minutes left|pg||
nt|andersk: 2,5 minutes left|pg||
nt|ady: now 7|pg||
nt|shevek: this one looks like yet another one :)|pg||
nt|othered1: Declarer is looking for best way to 10 tricks, not for an overtrick|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They knighted him for that??|pg||
nt|corplaw: nice def to set|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|Gerben42: if they win 22-8 they have 39, which is not great but getting back in|pg||
nt|ady: tried for 9|pg||
nt|MolvaM: for me a good match is when I win it|pg||
nt|brolucius: If this sort of deal appears in a problem book (where you are meant to see if you can deal with bad breaks in hearts and/or clubs), I usually turn the page to see the answer ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: straight away. I suppose - somewhere in the  universe - there is a hard-working bridge player who spends ages trying to work out the answers to such problems.|pg||
nt|james_h: North has only shown the @s for his effort => he has the @c K|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Roland you are right - |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Lizzy, get your act together!|pg||
nt|babs59: Don't you have Sir Ian Botham?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, Both was bionic|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Iron Bottom, as he was known in India |pg||
nt|babs59: here's a kib's contribution to that:  he was knighted for his contribution to alcohol consumption...|pg||
nt|odysseus69: club to ace - d jack - club ruff - spade - simple|pg||

nt|riccho: 2@h finde ich trotzdem mau|pg||

mb|1S|nt|shevek: 4@s might be a reasonable spot here|pg||
mb|p|nt|andersk: pls correct to minus 3|pg||
nt|eweber: if the medals were given for speed this table would probably qualify :)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: they will have to wait for their partners quite some time throughout the tournament|pg||
nt|Gerben42: Bauke Muller is not known to be fast|pg||
nt|eweber: 1@d here showed 11-16 with 4+ @d, unbalanced|pg||
nt|Gerben42: showing 4+@D paid off here|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 5@S still cheap for 300|pg||
nt|eweber: and the limit is useful as well|pg||
nt|eweber: in such auctions|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 6@D must be defended carefully, but I think after @S2 lead Drijver will get it|pg||
nt|eweber: with 7 hcp in @s 5@s is an option|pg||
nt|vasmar: double now|pg||
nt|ady: played a diamond to the 9 early on to make 4@S on board 9|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D game try in hearts perhaps but NS should wander into 4@S without too much difficulty |pg||
nt|athene: 3@S pass 4@S now|pg||
nt|pitiful:  5@c a nice spot here|pg||
nt|justin c: might try 6@H here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They gave him a chance to shine, and he grabbed it|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 4H for 650 where 1Dx was 800 here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@D=18-20 balanced|pg||
nt|babs59: Board 12 was sensibly passed out|pg||
mb|p|nt|shevek: Unfortunately losing 2@h - 1@d - 1@c|pg||
nt|lesh: 4@h and 4@s are making,just need to be reached|pg||
nt|petergill: OK, David is right, if @SK was from KJ doubleton the play for the overtrick risks the contract|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: the normal action practicly is ths K@C from KQ ending the defence  I enjoyed that detail|pg||
nt|odysseus69: that means there snt 1 - I never try for unbid slams- not enough grey cells|pg||
nt|udo: weches Vollspiel ist das chancenreichste auf OW ?|pg||
mb|2H|nt|roswolf: could be passed out?|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzng: the CR send me -2 will check|pg||
nt|andersk: ok|pg||
nt|brolucius: E/W play the weak 1NT, as we saw a deal or two ago, so they open 1@D here.|pg||

nt|hawe45:  - ou 500 Ã¡ 5 @D X|pg||

mb|3N|nt|Gerben42: at least the auction heated up some :)|pg||
nt|eweber: no double?|pg||
nt|tomi2:  1@S might have longer clubs than spades, I hope he alerted this :)|pg||
nt|andersk: stoppage time now|pg||
nt|haans: Cullin have it|pg||
nt|ady: very thin balance|pg||
nt|athene: now we have to find the club lead|pg||
nt|pitiful:  Roland is probably glued to the cricket at this moment|pg||
nt|MolvaM: elimination possibilities|pg||
nt|haans: 5@D looked like beginner bridge|pg||

nt|odysseus69: mexican 2D - balanced 18/19 - popular with Italy |pg||
nt|yusufb: pas|pg||
mb|p|nt|collins64: 5@c just made for Greece|pg||
nt|santyclz: Protecting the @hAQ.  Didn't see that coming.|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt not a bad shot - even when a minor-suit lead is right for the defence it's going to be hard for east to find it|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: West trying to disturb bidding |pg||
nt|h_karluk: x and cue|pg||
nt|sastro: fühle mich geehrt Udo ( hab diese Reizung mal vor 45 Jahren eingeführt )|pg||
mb|p|nt|vasmar: small diamond lead :)|pg||

nt|jameslee 2: 4@D?|pg||

nt|jameslee 2: 5/4/4/0 ?showing shape with void @C |pg||
nt|oleberg: Yes|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Do you all pass as S after 1@s opening? not for me. 3@c|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: nice |pg||
nt|oleberg: after 2@S 2NT would have shown a balanced hand|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: lets see if West  can stop in game |pg||
nt|yusufb: 3@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|ziff:  No insider jokes please :)|pg||

nt|haans: 6@D a make if @H lead|pg||
nt|yuval10: small @s would've been great|pg||
nt|yuval10: then they force declarer|pg||
nt|haans: more likely that E have the Q rather than A = weaker hand|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: they must be aware they having a poor set so might go for 6@h|pg||
nt|oleberg: 3@C and higher shows the intire distribution|pg||
nt|udo: 2@H ist jetzt sicher keine reversreizung,sondern eher ein schwächeres verteilungsblatt|pg||
pc|d3|nt|vugraphzng: NO DOUBLE APPARENTLY|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: sorry for upcqse|pg||
nt|Gerben42: Rudakov didnt know what 5@D showed in defense and Khven didn't count on @DA I guess|pg||
nt|paulhac:  An OK slam|pg||
nt|lmeili: how to show longer @d than @s?|pg||
nt|mamos: was 2@h single or two suited ?  the latter I think|pg||
nt|shevek: phantom got in the way|pg||
nt|MolvaM: tahts the problems with phantoms|pg||
nt|shevek: won't cost much though|pg||
nt|MolvaM: they should stick to hanging out in the operas|pg||
nt|babs59: we've also seen one from Russia on board 2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2NT=transfer to 3@C, either sign-off, balanced slam try or a slam try with 6+@H |pg||
pc|d5|nt|shevek: will get away with -50|pg||
nt|shevek: instead of +50|pg||
nt|mdgraham: could also be a sign-off in hearts|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|vugraphzng: seems to be clqi;end for -2, correction will come later if needed|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Diamonds 3-3 or doubleton J|pg||
nt|andersk: I have to go for a few|pg||
nt|tomi2:  he upgraded his hand to 18 with those aces and kings|pg||
nt|snetram:  teraz operator|pg||
nt|babs59: Will they be able to stop short of slam now?|pg||
nt|suketbombi: a 50% slam here (slightly less) for e-w a 4@C bid showing good clubs and a max wud hav e helped|pg||
nt|udo: mit stärkeren Blätern zuerst Kontra|pg||
nt|riccho: jetzt sind es 9 einfache stiche|pg||

nt|riccho: server hakt in Belgien? Selbst Andreas dürfte hier nicht viel zu denken haben|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|vasmar: now small diamond works also|pg||
nt|vasmar: if S misguesses|pg||
nt|ady: low diamond lead will beat this|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: puppet + 3@s showing hearts|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: there he is nice 4@S|pg||
pc|s4|nt|eweber: non vul doubling for -1 is a bad bargain when the contract may be made, none of them knows about the opther one's quick tricks|pg||
nt|ady: thlow spade lead also good enough|pg||
nt|mamos: just Hearts I'm told|pg||
nt|andreasw:  they were not in 4@s|pg||
nt|shevek: phantoms , yes :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Ivan was good enough to find it, grats|pg||

nt|oleberg: Well, 12 tricks are easy, on the friendly lay.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 6@s as @d are AJ|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: hand 13 playing 3NT but other side & not X |pg||
nt|odysseus69: it seems that nobody knows what to expecxt from preempts - its because players are varying them so much|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't think so, and slam is not that bad|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's basically on a finesse|pg||
nt|babs59: 6@C is the best slam|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6@C can make when diamonds are 3-3 or queen doubleton|pg||
nt|corplaw: looks like 2D should make exactly|pg||
pc|s8|nt|peachy: nicely judged|pg||
nt|peachy: as it is, 12 tricks|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Unless he takes a diamond finesse|pg||
nt|peachy: if they duck club, it will be testy|pg||
nt|brolucius: If yo use 12-14 and 15-17 as your ranges for 1NT and the 1NT rebid, a jump rebid of 2NT shows 18-19. They must do something different since West has only 17 here.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Hardly worth an upgrade, with those intermediates, it would seem.|pg||
nt|tomi2:  @S2 gives you the count of the spades, they should behave 4-4|pg||
nt|othered1: Giving an extra Work point or two when  you have only aces and kings is reasaonable, perhaps mandatory|pg||
nt|bagman: NS had 5@C or 5@D, going 1 or 2 down in 4@S is no disaster here|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ady: heart contract for 9 tricks best  |pg||
nt|haans: he had been thinking|pg||
nt|mcarroll: They dont listen to you Hans :)|pg||
nt|haans: see that|pg||
nt|haans: why not clubs to 9|pg||
nt|star6ija: 3rd hand plays high?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 6 clubs needs help from defence - preferably diamond lead- 6NT no chance |pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: well, at least this is NV :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: might be a few twists and turns though|pg||
nt|star6ija: no entries for dummy|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 4@H+2 =480 |pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer cannot get the diamonds wrong so he has 6 tricks there and gets at least one spade and either a @H or a @C|pg||
nt|bagman: Here most of the guesses work|pg||
pc|c4|nt|andersk: ty|pg||
nt|Gerben42: @H ruff is -2 |pg||
nt|yuval10: she indeed misguessed|pg||
nt|athene: small club after the @DA gives declarer a nasty moment but the odds must be to rise king|pg||
nt|athene: west would indeed lead low from @CQJxx, knowing the suit has to run, but it's more likely he simply has the ace|pg||
nt|aldek: non-vulnerable could be very weak|pg||
nt|mamos: not a great bid then imho   it made any exploration of the hands here impossible|pg||
nt|shevek: Thomas would've bid 4@s if it came around|pg||
nt|andreasw:  and then u could bid 5@c with the risk of being dbl but still u never now|pg||
nt|shevek: true, they bid it to make|pg||
nt|lechcold: 2BA nieestetyczne z uwagi na dziurê w treflach|pg||
nt|jkotor: sorry, spojrza³em, ¿e oba króle nie stoj¹...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: en toute probabilite, 300 a 5Kx je crois|pg||
nt|justin c: west might have preferred 4@C to 4@h |pg||
nt|petergill: NS play Two Way Checkback after 1@H - 1@S - 1NT|pg||
nt|petergill: so 2@C would have been artificial|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: instead E is playing West|pg||
nt|babs59: you can discard the 3rd @D on the @H, when @DQ doesn't drop - then @S to dummy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why help, Victor?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You pitch a diamond on a heart|pg||
nt|odysseus69: take me through play please|pg||
nt|bagman: The only losing case is to play W for AJ|pg||
pc|c2|nt|shevek: flat board|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Give the hand to K&R and ask what it's worth|pg||
nt|aldek: ktora nie idzie|pg||
nt|snetram:  a 3 karo nie wyjdzie|pg||
pc|cA|nt|haans: @H to Q and they forget to take two @D|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 3@D we can take it as a trial bid |pg||
nt|yusufb: 8@s altýn|pg||
nt|bagman: or for J only if a low comes now|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|haans: they did forget|pg||
nt|antoniz: tak jest -1|pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: 2@D,2@S,2@C|pg||
nt|justin c: but unclear whether East can cooperate over that|pg||
pc|sK|nt|peachy: good lead, gives nothing away|pg||
nt|lesh: thanks everyone, I have to go|pg||
nt|babs59: however, 6@C (by South) on a @S lead is trickier|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It is true that a spade lead kills the entry|pg||
nt|babs59: I missed the ruffing the 13th @D good, before going back to the @S - so 5 clubs, 3 hearts, 3 diamonds, 1 spade|pg||
nt|odysseus69: I see how but is that likely line- and of couse spade lead finishes it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, but there is an alternative, and losing, line|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe even a better one|pg||
nt|babs59: Just one?  I see the @D finesse, or trying for short @SA, or a squeeze|pg||
nt|Walddk2: diamond finesse in combination with @SA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: doubleton|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|pitiful:  well if that is your style and it works well for you you tend to stick to it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Kaplan & Rubens Hand Evaluator|pg||
nt|tomi2:  we will need some undo here|pg||
pc|h2|nt|koksoy: herhalde  batmaz...  karolar  partaj  (3-3)|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|dburn: looks natural to play a spade now, but I don't think it will work|pg||
nt|odysseus69: and as my friend Tony Waterlow pointed out if he guesses to play spade Q on Jack he is stil ok - all very inspired|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|ady: no way to make unless north discards 2 clubs when hearts are run|pg||
nt|chick: thanks Jivko@H@H|pg||
nt|aldek: 2BA nie mozna przegrac|pg||
nt|oleberg: The underlead looked costly, but gained a trick|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You need @SK as an entry if you go for diamonds (no finesse)|pg||
nt|bagman: E sees that most of the suits are frozen so attacks the trumps|pg||
pc|c5|nt|vasmar: plenty of tricks now for N-S nut not enough ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 18.3 on the K&R so an upgrade was fine|pg||
pc|cK|nt|rigas_karo: @d now for -3|pg||
nt|yuval10: big board for Germany|pg||
nt|ady: south likely to discard 2 diamonds and a club|pg||
nt|roswolf: well i think this can make by force but timing needs to be exacrt|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer went against Restricted Choice in the heart suit.|pg||
nt|jkotor: Janusz jedn¹ lewê zdejmij|pg||
mc|9|nt|paulhac:  He may be able to work out the distribution in which case he may well go off|pg||
nt|peachy: cashing spades to get information on shapes and discards, not sure if it will help him|pg||
nt|santyclz: I'm sure I could convince myself to go wrong there.|pg||

pc|hK|nt|shevek: I don't mind 3@s, (he can't have more than 5 anyway)|pg||
pc|h8|nt|benjent: The plain defence is to give East a ruff ... but then East can be squeezed in the minors|pg||
nt|rodal f: Agree. S have told his story. Did it twice|pg||

nt|lestergold: does south know the meaning of west's double|pg||

nt|benjent: no, no - criss cross is still on|pg||
nt|rodal f: I was a bit blind my self.|pg||

nt|lestergold: yes but he has to read it|pg||
nt|rodal f: E pitch after N? Still on?|pg||
nt|benjent: X was a single-suiter|pg||
nt|lestergold: so the position of K@d at this vulnerability is anyone's guess|pg||
nt|benjent: yes - N has @dA and @c64, S has @dQ9 and @cK - and East has to come down to 3 cards|pg||
nt|lestergold: go for the criss cross as it is more fun for the specs and it happens top also work on the hand|pg||
pc|s4|pc|hJ|pc|d6|pc|d8|pg||

nt|pitiful:  everyday|pg||
nt|ralfwil: You cannot lose more than 2@d and 1@h, so always 10 tricks|pg||

nt|Gerben42: @S to Ace and @C back|pg||
nt|eweber: ...if no ruff|pg||
nt|Gerben42: Dbl and lead @S2 :)|pg||
nt|haans: ERROR|pg||
nt|ady: very thin opening |pg||
nt|pitiful:  East enjoyed his partner's 2N|pg||
nt|pitiful:  some might pass warts and all|pg||
nt|shevek: Xfer response|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: & they are playing 3NT N-S|pg||
nt|oleberg: Yes, but discarding a diamond is superior for 11, tricks|pg||
nt|bagman: The redoubled 2@C reminds me of a deal from 1993 Menton against two Polish players|pg||
nt|suketbombi: showing @Cs and @SS i guess|pg||
nt|ady: 11 tricks in spades for n/s|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 3@C trf to @Ds i think|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: 1@H correct?|pg||
nt|yuval10: board 12: 13 imps for Austria, when Germany played 6@c and misguessed the trumps|pg||
mb|3H|nt|Gerben42: 1@C was strong, and 3@H creates big problems|pg||
nt|peachy: 1S showed either diamonds, or balanced|pg||
nt|pitiful:  the comeback has started on board 13|pg||
nt|mamos: sorry I have to leave   thanks all  England 5 imps   the fight back begins|pg||
nt|pitiful:  unlucky 13 for the dutch?|pg||
nt|oleberg: But I can't say which line is best.|pg||
nt|pikonlu: undo varmý diye soran arkadaslara , gercek oyunda elbette undo yok, operator yanlýslýk kagýda týkladýgý icin oluyor|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes 2@c shd be @cs and other major on such an auction|pg||
nt|ady: 5@D    500  against 650   |pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: 4@H and still no suits have been shown|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like another routine game for EW?|pg||
nt|tomi2:  other table will make this becasue NS lead 2/4/6 and a 6 card suit not bid is unlikely|pg||
nt|petergill: (11) 12-14|pg||
nt|barnets: on the slam it is suggested if dec can come down to @DAK in dummy and !AQ and 3 @Ds in hand and a trump|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: For minors-non vul against vul.|pg||
nt|haans: bidding are correct operator say|pg||
nt|pitiful:  this is going to be ugly but could be at most tables|pg||
nt|dburn: what is Gold doing?|pg||
nt|aldek: this will be bloody|pg||
nt|dburn: bidding 4@h in case partner didn't hear him bid 3@h?|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe this is a misprint - it's hard to believe that East really bid like this; perhaps 4@h was really 4@d|pg||
nt|pitiful:  initially David was not enjoying the auction, now it is Tom's turn to join in|pg||
nt|othered1: If you're going to take a line like west's, why not just play @S back at NS right away?|pg||
nt|tomi2:  2/3 of German top pairs play negative free bids|pg||
nt|marlowepi: a mon avis, N devrait dire 4K car assez souvent S aura une main ou le sacrifice serait bon. esperer que les adveaux empaillent la manche n'est pas tres realiste, et esperer battre ...|pg||

nt|riccho: Am anderen Tisch hat man mit OW 5@c getestet und feststellen müssen, dass 3SA von W nach @d Angriff leichter sind|pg||
mb|p|nt|rigas_karo: i think he could go 2 down actually if he cashed one round of trumps after north overuffed with the A@h|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Negative free bids, like 2@C here, are popular in some places|pg||
nt|chick: 4 of either major should make|pg||

nt|lechcold: 3@H nieforsuj¹ce teraz?|pg||
nt|oleberg: And wise of declarer not to use to much energy on that|pg||
nt|bagman: We got to 2@C XX via Stayman and I was the declarer. My screenmate showed me his hand expecting my partner to be playing it|pg||
nt|corplaw: only 8 tricks on a heart lead, but will N lead his suit|pg||
pc|h5|nt|vasmar: Spade lead and continuation may set it i think|pg||
nt|andreasw:  not if @h AJx sit's by west and @s K on east:)|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: Swill just stop in 4@H|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @dJ on side is 50% so....|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Stave Weinstein suggests that it's better to play @D10 to see if covered, if not revert to the ruffing out diamond line|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Steve|pg||

nt|ady: anyone know what 1@H is    not alert?|pg||
nt|ftpe: yes|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@S max with 5 spades|pg||
nt|barnets: south is caught in a trump sueeze|pg||
nt|odysseus69: i did suggest d10|pg||
nt|ady: surprising to go to 5@S by north     should pass round for south to decide|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes and @S need to be 2/2 for 5@s wise to settle for 500 but..|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|peachy: NT will be a poor strain this time, one can only hope they dont bid 3|pg||
nt|lmeili: good gor Germany, no double|pg||
nt|pitiful:  interesting lead for south|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: chance here if E/W can produce some red cards|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: actually plays quite well 3@d be close|pg||
nt|petergill: Even if you play Simple Stayman, responding 3@H or 3@S with a max with a 5 card suit to simple Stayman is a pretty good idea IMO, rarely costs|pg||
nt|petergill: No reason to get spades wrong, as far as I can see|pg||
nt|ozgull: batýnýn 5 pik demesini bekliyoruz :)|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|boyklas: -2 now with a small H|pg||
nt|eweber: and now the wrong hand decl. in a spade contract|pg||
nt|ziff:  No double, no trouble|pg||
nt|pitiful:  how many down?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maths + psychology. Maybe he has a point|pg||
nt|yusufb: 3@s deyince salvo @d dayalý elini anlattý þimdiki 4nt gereksiz bence|pg||
nt|corplaw: another hand where lead from longest suit works best|pg||
nt|corplaw: an original low club lead though could set contract 2 tricks|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer has enough entries to take care of JTxx in South so West is quite happy now|pg||
pc|hA|nt|eweber: and probably no chance to find the 2nd fit|pg||
nt|motu: hard to dbl for N|pg||
nt|MolvaM: now a non heart lead could bring overtrivk|pg||
nt|andreasw:  will bring a overtrcik but a @h lead look's fair|pg||
nt|andreasw:  then again east could have dbl 1@h|pg||
nt|andreasw:  for the lead|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: a part score 3@C |pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: Tam wzi¹³ 13(!) mlew... na 3@H|pg||

nt|snetram:  13 lew po serii faÅszywych renonsÃ³w?|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: North still going for the slam|pg||
nt|oleberg: the defence to 5@h will be interesting|pg||
nt|oleberg: The @SA cannot be taken prematurely|pg||
nt|barnets: @CAQ|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Russia made 6C -|pg||
nt|mdgraham: much needed|pg||
pc|h8|nt|MolvaM: would that just ask for a lead or show a real suit?|pg||
nt|andreasw:  well done!|pg||
nt|brolucius: Lauria, Versace use non-forcing responses in a new suit over a take-out double.|pg||
nt|lechcold: wygl¹da ¿e to nie idzie|pg||
pc|d3|nt|yuval10: over @s lead, S needs to signal what she has|pg||
nt|yuval10: for me it's 7@s indicating @d|pg||
nt|ady: 4 tricks or 8 on heart finesse |pg||
nt|dburn: well, he has six tricks|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 9 tricks |pg||
nt|haans: know that @H wrong|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: a seniorsi 48-30 z Walij¹|pg||
nt|oleberg: And a squeeze of East is lurking, but much to double-dummy to find|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|peachy: Not sure what subesequent bidding showed. |pg||
nt|hawe45:  South throws trick away|pg||
nt|athene: NS lead attitude against notrumps - definitely favoured amongst the top italian players|pg||
nt|dburn: so I guess that's four down|pg||
nt|pitiful:  i was thinking 3|pg||
nt|koksoy: umarým   @C  V yi  bulur|pg||
nt|yusufb: ataktan cýkar belki ama @h J cýkar|pg||

nt|yusufb: 4@s x li 2 batsýn daha iyi degilmi|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|vasmar: true|pg||
nt|yuval10: will help P not to play @c here|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 1 imp for wales now|pg||
nt|oleberg: the defence to 6@H should be possible to find|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: Iceland on the lead 16/15 |pg||
nt|ralfwil: too high is always selfdefending:)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: however not on scoreboard yet|pg||
pc|hT|nt|vasmar: she must continue spades now|pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: Nie - Operator sie grobn¹³. Rozgrywaka jeszcze trwqa|pg||
nt|barnets: so there are 4 cards left in each hand|pg||
nt|odysseus69: yes a good result|pg||
pc|d5|nt|dburn: yes, but you're not defending|pg||
nt|pitiful:  i know 4 looks likely but sometimes 1 gets away |pg||
nt|dburn: oh, sure - no one ever believes how bad the contract actually is|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: time for a good think by east |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: A@S or not ?|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: A@S makes = 12 tricks asOle told us |pg||
nt|oleberg: No 11|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If my partner lead @s2 he has an honour..... |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: so defence needs to put J@S|pg||
nt|oleberg: There is always a heart-loser|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: true there is a 9@H problem there good point by specs|pg||
nt|oleberg: But the @SJ will keep declarer to 10 tricks|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|yusufb: þimdi @s gelirse ne atýcak:)|pg||
nt|koksoy: ufak  kör  gelme  :)|pg||
nt|bagman: Now north is hoping that West has Qx of clubs|pg||
nt|corplaw: another possible large swing to bulgaria|pg||
nt|bagman: He knows he cannot beat the contract any more and hopes that it was makeable with any lead|pg||
nt|riccho: Sieht nach billig 2 down aus. Wenn die defense noch was probiert ist es vielleicht auch nur 1 down...|pg||
pc|s3|nt|snetram:  tu moÅ¼e byc bez jednej|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: I think S meant 2NT as pick a minor over 3@C would decide whether to pass or not|pg||
pc|s8|nt|Gerben42: 13 tops now |pg||
nt|petergill: With 9 trumps, you play for the drop, and with 8 trumps you finesse the queen, unless the bidding and/or play suggests otherwise |pg||
nt|oleberg: It is always 11 (thx kibz) |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|dburn: for example, Brink may not believe he can give Drijver a spade ruff, because that would mean East's bidding is completely berserk|pg||
nt|pitiful:  surely not Ace|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Alternatively, you can cash @DAK to see if the queen falls, if not go for the ruffing out line|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|ziff:  The contract could be cold, or he might give away the position|pg||
nt|vasmar: now it makes easily|pg||
nt|andreasw:  dosent matter u have no problm in 2@h x if opp,s have the 4@s|pg||
nt|tomi2:  I am a fan of nfb, but not sure everybody agrees :)|pg||
nt|bogier: jest|pg||

nt|ozgull: eðer asý çekmez ise|pg||
pc|c5|nt|athene: south doesn't see any future in hearts for the defence - he doesn't know how few declarer has, for one thing|pg||
nt|petergill: Susan is obtaining information about the layout before she commits herself in spades|pg||
nt|barnets: dec needs to take a spade ruff in dummy to engineer this|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Many lines, only one was good enough|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Somebody will probably calculate the odds before too long|pg||

nt|jameslee 2: S will see that @C 3/1 after west not play second @C|pg||

nt|vasmar: no you are right|pg||

mb|p|nt|Gerben42: 170 will be flat|pg||
nt|motu: now 3@D would show 4441|pg||
nt|motu: there it is|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think e/w may well declare a heart contract|pg||
nt|roswolf: level is questionable though|pg||
nt|santyclz: 2nt seems a stretch.|pg||
nt|athene: west has a difficult rebid the way the auction went|pg||
nt|athene: 1nt seems a bit of an underbid|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: we are arriving to te last 5 boards and ll in |pg||
nt|8252: certains l'assouplisse à 4 @s 3 @h|pg||

nt|riccho: Ich hab 3:2 für BRA getippt. Da müssen noch vieel Tore fallen...|pg||
nt|riccho: Das 2@s hat GRO jetzt ein bisserl aus der Reizung genommen. Vor allem wenn jetzt 4@s kommt|pg||
nt|udo: 4@S kontra?,,oder nochmal reizen ? oder passen ?|pg||
nt|j li: An Passe glaube ich nicht|pg||
nt|udo: dann lieber 2 @h und dann5 @c ?|pg||
nt|sastro: halte es für sinnvoll 2-Färber nur mit guten Händen zu zeigen, wenn man hohfft den Kontrakt zu gewinnen, weil sonst der Gegner mehr davon hat wenn er  später die Verteilung für ...|pg||
nt|sastro: sein Alleinspiel kennt|pg||
nt|udo: ein Punkt,  und 6er Oberfarben sind heilig|pg||
nt|riccho: gute alte Schule :) aber damit bin ich einverstanden |pg||
mb|4S|nt|ady: J@D lead beats 5@C would have tht west might have gone straight to 4@H|pg||
nt|snetram:  raczej good stop - trzy lewy z gÃ³ry i impas. Minus nadbitka. jak na przedpartyjnÄ koÅcÃ³wkÄ nic rewelacyjnego|pg||
nt|lechcold: 6@C na re-open?|pg||
nt|barnets: only bid 6N so there will be a big jump|pg||
mb|4N|nt|rigas_karo: i guess it will be difficult to stay low here|pg||
nt|tomi2:  Dr. Wladow has some ideas on working / not working finesses in Grand Slams depending on vulnerbility and board number|pg||
nt|ziff:  He has some other ideas as well....|pg||
nt|tomi2:  but I think red/white is "5 or 7, never bid 6"|pg||
nt|roswolf: 5@C WOULD HAVE BEEN MY CHOICE|pg||
nt|roswolf: sorry for the shouting|pg||
nt|roswolf: dont like the pass by east|pg||

nt|shevek: no|pg||
nt|shevek: 2+|pg||
nt|odysseus69: x for sure for me|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1NT gets the hcp across, but with no aces and only Kx clubs, double seems a better option|pg||
nt|ady: Israel may play in hearts|pg||
nt|j li: 4SA im Gegensatz zu 5@C zeigt vermutlich 6@h5@C|pg||
nt|riccho: impliziert 4SA jetzt ein 6er @h?|pg||

nt|riccho: :)|pg||
mb|5H|nt|motu: basicly it is related to success|pg||
nt|motu: 4@C is rkcb and 4NT 2+@SQ|pg||
nt|tomi2:  4@C asking for keycards, all aere ther|pg||
nt|ziff:  Let s hope for 7 then (only the Germans, of course, Bulgarians are allowed to hope for 5) ;)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  2 @C might be the solution|pg||
nt|oleberg: Being a passed hand, 1NT is no longer a relay|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and now the escape methods can get wheeled out |pg||
nt|udo: macht Sinn,,5@C mit 5-5|pg||
mb|5S|nt|paulg:  4@d an unusual bid with 4-4 minors, but unlucky to suffer this fate compared to 4@c|pg||
nt|paulhac:  This looks expensive for the Spanish|pg||
nt|antoniz: do us³yszenia:)|pg||
nt|bogier: w praktyce 6@C nie wychodzi|pg||
nt|lechcold: ee, dlaczego?|pg||
nt|aldek: wychodzi|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 1NT= 7 tricks |pg||

mb|p|nt|tomi2:  so havong AQ of dia himself and QJ of hearts he virtualy sees no loser ;)|pg||
nt|motu: 5@C ask for kings|pg||
nt|yuval10: @h lead likely, then many tricks for declarer|pg||
nt|vasmar: only spade lead can embarass declarer but not seriously|pg||
nt|pitiful:  i am told 1 unfortunate south played in 6@s doubled on the previous board|pg||
nt|dburn: did he make it?|pg||
nt|pitiful:  and one east 6@d redoubled !|pg||
nt|pitiful:  well you might have made it David|pg||
nt|pitiful:  but I think he went 1 off|pg||
nt|shevek: wonder why not 1NT|pg||
nt|andreasw:  what about @h?|pg||

nt|justin c: guess 2@H showed @H and minor|pg||
nt|barnets: did not locate their @D fit|pg||
nt|riccho: Andreas wird das sicher gut finden, dass der Gegner jetzt noch 5@s gereizt hat|pg||
nt|sastro: hmm - denke mal nicht, dass man auf dieser Stufe noch mit 5-5 operiert|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzng: There are information that on board 9, it was not put in the right direction in the other room, expect modification|pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: Tewraz mo¿e wzi¹æ nawet 13 lew|pg||
nt|me argent: apres moi il devait dire quelque chose ou risque manquer un manche vul|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: Its easy to be critical of players on BBO but you have to recall we can see all the cards and these guys are on day 7 now of tough bridge that takes some stamina|pg||
nt|jaapfr: successfull 1nt bid although @S 432 not a sensational @S holding:)|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: or |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 1Nt = -1|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: dependes on defence |pg||
nt|ralfwil: not on a @c return|pg||
nt|barnets: after west opened 1N|pg||
nt|odysseus69: all the other matches are close except Iceland at moment heading for 20-10 v Netherlands|pg||
nt|koksoy: 3@s  oynarken   oynayanýn   körde  9 lu  empasý  veya  @D  da  D empasý  mevcut  ataktan  fire  olmazsa|pg||
nt|udo: ist Gros passe forcing? für mich nicht|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: Routine.|pg||
nt|motu: 5@D= @DK|pg||
nt|lmeili: so he has no @h k?|pg||
nt|tomi2:  @H8 lead vs slam would work nicely, if you have "top of nothing" on your card :)|pg||
nt|ady: now may make an overtrick|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: anoter part score hand |pg||
nt|psridhar: Fredin is quite active making 3 bids ( so far) on his aceless minimum|pg||
nt|psridhar: EW were better off defending 2c i thk|pg||
nt|psridhar: bd 15 sweden passed out 1H -may be a swing for Israel|pg||
nt|odysseus69: end|pg||
pc|cK|nt|collins64: what's 2NT|pg||
nt|roswolf: well this seems to be very good for ireland|pg||
nt|ftpe: even poor lead, will go down|pg||
nt|xenya: think he can make?|pg||
nt|ftpe: no way|pg||
nt|xenya: we will see|pg||
nt|xenya: it feels there must be a way|pg||
nt|ftpe: agree, can be exciting, but dont think he will make it|pg||
nt|bogier: ale wist chyba nie jest do rozszyfrowania 9 z 10 9 sec|pg||
nt|ady: wull have to get hearts right|pg||
pc|c4|nt|shevek: 14-16|pg||
nt|ady: 3@C  down 1    but hard for east not to compete to 3 hearts|pg||
nt|j li: Für Andreas auch nicht|pg||
pc|c9|nt|rigas_karo: 5 top tricks for the defence|pg||
nt|motu: 5@D says nothing about other kings but East is limited to 14 so another K is not possible|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: nice lead from North we must say so |pg||
nt|odysseus69: 2 service breaks for Murray in 3rd set|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|boyklas: 16-18 Balanced|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Trump split painful for declarer|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You can have 1NT as a transfer to 2@C|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am told: Duboin makes 3NT on 14. gets @s2 and shoots a @s straight back! When nobody wants to cash out the spades, he ducks a club.|pg||
nt|tomi2:  In poland 99.9 % play non forcing, in Germany we have lots of influences in bidding and defense, some from French bidding style, some from American books and some from Polish players, because some German players are Polish origin, like Piekarek |pg||
nt|ryskiel_: i wemie|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 7 tricks now|pg||
nt|barnets: not really a good effort by them|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6NT made at some tables on 14. It should not have|pg||
nt|ady: yes Iceland doing a lot right|pg||
pc|hA|nt|tomi2:  voila|pg||
nt|lmeili: wow!|pg||
nt|ziff:  Seems to be the right board number|pg||
nt|pitiful:  you could probably write a very long article or even a book on just that board, where is David Bird|pg||

nt|jkotor: jakby trefle 2-1, to ju¿ by karty pokaza³|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it's funny how when you start redoubling here, you just know that the final contract is going to be two of something doubled  |pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes david even if the opponents are pushed to 3@H @HS need to be guesse in view of the 3@C bid|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 2dn cud be the result|pg||
nt|ady: Israel do have a chance on hand 14  if they bid the round about 50-50 slam|pg||
nt|skaftij:  migth play side suits, trying to figure out distribution|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|rnmalik: 11 tricks.|pg||
nt|ady: dont think east's pass wrong    has already shown values with 2NT|pg||
nt|ady: north sure to get diamonds right|pg||
nt|roswolf: west might/should have bid 4@H but i would have done more as east on this auction|pg||
nt|psridhar: whatever their methods were , this 2nt is not pretty on club lead|pg||
nt|psridhar: i fancy -200|pg||
pc|h9|nt|shevek: no they play mini NT not vul (10-12)|pg||
nt|tomi2:  in the OR, so you see some pairs playing SEF based style, some 2/1 and some use polish club and polish style bids and carding|pg||
nt|8252: il protège les @c en duquant, et espère l'AS d'atout an Nord, ou un gisement des @s favorable|pg||
nt|bagman: This lead was quite helpful for the declarer. With the cards being nice it did not matter much, however|pg||
nt|mdgraham: or, as happened on a memorable occasion, four of something doubled|pg||
nt|odysseus69: not too many entries to South|pg||
nt|bagman: brb|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|paulg:  at least he can pitch a heart on the fourth spade|pg||
nt|hawe45:  120 - next|pg||
nt|shevek: http://tinyurl.com/29ud57z|pg||
pc|cA|nt|collins64: A@c for the 10@c|pg||
nt|pitiful:  probably watching the cricket with Roland...|pg||
nt|pitiful:  looks like 9 tricks here|pg||
nt|xenya: now 2 hearts pitching 2 diamonds -- that must be his plan?|pg||
nt|ftpe: he probably knows cl 3-3, so maybe will play on clubs|pg||
nt|xenya: but that would lead to a defeat i think -- discarding diamonds i mean|pg||
nt|xenya: and trying to ruff a @D loser in the dimmy|pg||
nt|suketbombi: guessed the @Hs alright|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Iceland has the chance on bd 14|pg||
pc|c5|nt|haans: many plax xx as forcing to at lead 2nt|pg||
nt|brolucius: It will be interesting to see how many pairs reach 7@D. Perhaps a majority at this level.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: now David did you say you wanted to be kept up to date with cricket?|pg||
pc|c6|nt|collins64: and @s|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: creative bidding would  be my guess:)|pg||
nt|paulg:  although not an ideal start to a doubled four-level contract|pg||
nt|haans: just to tease|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|vasmar: club was not a success|pg||
nt|star6ija: 3rd trump trick apeared|pg||
nt|corplaw: NS had a spade partial|pg||
nt|corplaw: W should expect that N has no more clubs, since S wouldn't be setting up dummy|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ziff:  Of course he didn t lead @H8 as he had no idea where @HA is, but it would sure have been fun :)|pg||
nt|psridhar: S will duck dia queen to cut declarer off his hand|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 23/19 getting closer te match |pg||
nt|psridhar: perhpas Fallenius might hv tried 2S over Fredin's 2D- a much better spot than 2nt|pg||
nt|haans: so fredin just had to countinue bidding|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 2nt a contract you bid but you never play|pg||
nt|psridhar: Israel are in 2H other room as EW|pg||
nt|psridhar: Denmark leading 51-7 vs Estonia after bd 16|pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: Trefl do sto³u i Pik; przeciez wistu spod @SKróla nie mog³o byc|pg||

nt|jkmjanusz: I teraz do spodu. Co ma trzymac S? |pg||
nt|marlowepi: sauf ca:)|pg||
nt|brolucius: No!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|pg||
nt|riccho: In Bd. 15 haben Piekarek Smirnov ein weiteres exzellentes Ergebnis mit 4@s = nach Hause gebracht|pg||
pc|s4|nt|haans: they may open one or two points shorter|pg||
nt|snetram:  lepiej byÅo pokryc waleta pik|pg||
nt|marlowepi: tout le monde joue tres bien sur cette donne|pg||
nt|justin c: i have to go - enjoy the rest of the match all|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: Ireland started really well and this squad beat the team silver in the trials ... its a learning curve and one which will stand to them ... |pg||
pc|c7|nt|rigas_karo: same|pg||
nt|xenya: in the OR, the lead was a safe a heart |pg||
nt|psridhar: Russia up 4--15 vs Ireland with one bd to go|pg||
nt|marlowepi: mieux|pg||
nt|me argent: mais avec les 2K noir mal places il va chuter|pg||
nt|ritong: il est tres probable que l autre salle atteindra aussi ce tres bon contrat|pg||
nt|bernix: .|pg||

nt|koksoy: kýrmýzý  renkleri  ellememek  cok  zordu ...  tam  oldu|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|vasmar: there may be a club spade squeeze|pg||
nt|psridhar: 40-15|pg||
nt|mdgraham: years ago in the Spring Foursomes - partner and I doubled 2@D. The oppo removed, and ended in 4@Dx. Not a success |pg||
pc|s6|nt|paulg:  bidding 4@c would have given someone the option of running if doubled (although never easy to work out when to run) ... 4@d has no such safety valve|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Could easily play East for KQ@C doubleton and go for 800|pg||
nt|xenya: well now he MUST discard diamonds on the hearts |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: big smash there fron denmark |pg||
nt|odysseus69: I hear that Hacketts bid 6NT|pg||
nt|bagman: declarer is still going to lose a spade and a diamond|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Back to that slam on 14. At one table where the contract was 6NT, West avoided the diamond lead, but the contract still made when East rose with the ace (low spade from dummy)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: better to win spade ace and take 2 ruffs then diamond jack gets promoted|pg||
pc|s8|nt|pitiful:  didn't cash their @s|pg||
nt|tomi2:  as predicted Italy won 3NT over there, dubion exited with a spade and had tempo to try the clubs because he knew the @S split|pg||
nt|j li: Smirnov hat über einenCriss-Cross-Squeeze erfüllt!|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|pitiful:  11 now|pg||
nt|psridhar: Bulagria leading italy 33-25 with one Bd o go|pg||
nt|8252: oui, mais entre le chelem de tout à l'heure, et ce 4 @s, la carte se montre méchante cet après midi pour E W|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: @s cannot go anywhere|pg||
nt|ady: Israel got 11 on board 12  where they could take all the hearts and ace of spades in 3NT|pg||
nt|babs59: the @DJ will be promoted here anyway - or the @D7 even|pg||
nt|riccho: wow|pg||

nt|bagman: EW are losing 4 tricks in major suit contracts|pg||
nt|corplaw: even NS good boards go for naught.  Lost 7 imps on board 11, when NS made 4S (!) in other room on 8 diamonds lead from QJ8x, declarer played K from K109x, but W ducked A expecting ...|pg||
nt|corplaw: pd for doubleton and keeping communications|pg||
nt|bagman: 3@S likely to be competitive|pg||
nt|bagman: as W can bid minors to show forcing hands in majors|pg||
nt|bagman: also known as unusual over unusual|pg||
nt|corplaw: have to go; tx all|pg||
nt|udo: 4@S OW sieht ganz gut aus|pg||

nt|james_h: rat a tat tat|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: cant see how they down in 3NT in the other room 9 top tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|vasmar: I think 6@h make played by E (if she guesses diamonds) unless S underlead clubs|pg||
nt|peachy: a counteroffer|pg||
nt|peachy: sry guys|pg||
nt|santyclz: Not in @ds.  A good sign.|pg||
nt|tomi2:  the field is relatively close and Germany is around 15VP in front of 10th, so it would also be important to score well against the non-qualifiers too|pg||
nt|jkotor: 1@d to pewnie transfer na 4+@h|pg||

nt|bagman: I find it quite amusing that there really are people who watch televised cricket|pg||
nt|ady: poor opening bid north|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: Interesting hand.|pg||
nt|james_h: oooh baby|pg||
nt|ady: this comes home with A@D well placed   and 4 heart tricks coming in|pg||
nt|suketbombi: but it gains tuff to set 2@S while 1Nt will score |pg||
mb|4S|nt|andersk: Not any boards from live page updated from this match, yet. I have a feeling 2 boards are misscoored, for +3 IMP to Croatia|pg||
nt|rnmalik: would require good play to make this contract.|pg||
nt|paulg:  As well as starting much later on Saturday, you'll only have 16 board matches in the Seniors|pg||
nt|brolucius: Perhaps you are not English?|pg||
nt|barnets: is 100 a good score at cricket ?|pg||
nt|bagman: maybe that's the explanation|pg||
nt|brolucius: We don't watch javelin throwing on TV, like you do!|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Israel still heading for 19 Iceland 15|pg||
nt|bagman: E was quite sure they were missing nothing after the competitive 3@S bid|pg||
nt|bagman: North was offering South to pick a minor. E knowing that there's also diamond fit is happy to let NS play the suit which sits badly for them|pg||
nt|bagman: West might consider leading any of his major suit cards|pg||
nt|bagman: Is west waiting for east to lead?|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  Presumably to allow more time for a decent bottle in the evening|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 4333 everyone|pg||
nt|shevek: guess I'm getting old Andreas :)|pg||
nt|haans: 1@H trf|pg||
nt|koksoy: batacak|pg||
nt|bagman: If west doesn't lead a spade, declarer has normally one loser in each suit going one down|pg||
nt|j li: Hätte West 3@s sagen sollen?|pg||
mb|p|nt|boyklas: making 5|pg||

nt|petergill: Double dummy, @S5 lead and a club switch might trouble this, but in the real world 3NT makes in comfort|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: sthere we shall see E developing @D fira|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@D=hearts|pg||
nt|bagman: With the trumps breaking like they are even the spade lead cannot give the contract|pg||
nt|motu: ich finde nein|pg||
nt|j li: mir auch etwas zu dünn|pg||
nt|sastro: denke mal Andreas sollte schon 3 Pik sagen- haben wohl Stil auch schwach zwischenzureizen|pg||
nt|udo: 3@S finde ich knapp,,,,falsches Ass|pg||
mb|5H|nt|haans: we now all know i was right :)|pg||
nt|vasmar: another 2 imos in board 15 for germany|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 1@H = 4 card @S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In the finals the 9 teams from one group will play against the 9 from the other group and an aggregate score is calculated|pg||
nt|tomi2:  Italy and Iceland have quite confortable leads, they can try to relax in matches agains teams, that will be relegated for sure and save some energy and avoid time penalties (don't know if penalties are also carried into 2nd RR)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Six teams will qualify for the Bermuda Bowl - the top six in the second round-robin. At the moment the field is split into two, so around the top 3 in each section may be seen as ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: the top contenders at present. But there is some luck involved in which of your scores are dropped after the first round-robin.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Penalties are carried forward if both teams qualify, not if only one of them|pg||
nt|chick: with the diamond finesse working and a good guess in clubs, he can make 6|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: he has 3@D +3@C+2@S= 8 tricks |pg||
nt|bagman: :)|pg||
nt|barnets: bad news |pg||
mb|d|nt|paulhac:  Of course!|pg||
nt|vasmar: imps|pg||
nt|vasmar: n lightner double?|pg||
nt|haans: :(|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 4@S= 10 tricks |pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's stated in the bulletins|pg||
nt|odysseus69: te he Italian philosophy is to bid all suits where there is possible weakness - most Brits would simply bid 3NT after Stayman|pg||
nt|barnets: hacketts stopped in 4@H so we dont get to see if they can make it|pg||
nt|barnets: they led a diamond so prob just as well they stopped|pg||
nt|barnets: @D is tthe best lead for defense|pg||
nt|yusufb: batmaz|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: N might have been contemplating a @h raise there.|pg||
nt|xenya: seems any reasonable line will succeed here|pg||
nt|james_h: Good show, now make it :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|rigas_karo: ruff a @c, @s and claim... next board|pg||
nt|eweber: many diamonds with NE here|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer might take the club finesse now|pg||
nt|odysseus69: going to lose club to bare q maybe- however he does not have entries if North has qxxx so maybe not|pg||
nt|yusufb: italya danimarkaya 25-0 vp olarak onde farký acýyo|pg||
nt|udo: 300|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Gerben42: this will somehow make I gues|pg||
nt|Gerben42: even though only 8 tricks are clear, all those 10 will trouble EW|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: this looks makeable - whats the best way to handle diamonds ?  guess @dA and ruff one ... |pg||
nt|petergill: South played the opening bidder for @HQ on the last hand in order to make up her 12 HCP for her opening bid - surely?|pg||
pc|s5|nt|vasmar: but now she has to find diamonds|pg||
nt|andreasw:  im hopefully not:)|pg||
nt|ftpe: sotuh knows that north has 0 points|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am told that Netherlands qill qualify for BB as hosts. So there may be 6 more Euro qualifiers, making 7 in all.|pg||
nt|petergill: that's why it was 120|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but a finesse could not lose imo|pg||
nt|oleberg: The declarer will know, whether he can afford to duck a club|pg||

nt|yusufb: wdwd|pg||
nt|suketbombi: finaly Israel scores a imp after 12 bds|pg||
pc|sK|nt|Gerben42: but has to take care of communication to make his 9th trick|pg||
nt|Gerben42: might get stranded with @HA|pg||
nt|eweber: playing @h first might help, but both J and K are wrongsided|pg||
nt|ady: trying to steal 7the trick|pg||
nt|bernix: with trump 2/2 no way to go down|pg||
pc|s8|nt|andersk: fortunate @C split|pg||

nt|riccho: Am anderen Tisch wider: in 4@s im X spielt Piekarek nach gleichem Start wie hier Pik zur 9 |pg||
pc|h4|nt|rigas_karo: actuallt q@s and @d, declarer has to guess what to do for the overtrick, but both lines work|pg||

nt|oleberg: A spade switch might have troubled declarer|pg||

nt|kdr_fm: ya but he doesnt know all this :> if u didnt see the opps cards whats the best line - spades 3/1 and diamonds 4/2 can u still do it ?|pg||
nt|bagman: The proble playing @CA and J is that if S covers, you don't know what to do|pg||
pc|c5|nt|Gerben42: likely to go down now unless he finds @HJ|pg||

nt|eweber: now he has a new problem|pg||
nt|Gerben42: but if so, why not play @C2 instead|pg||
nt|Gerben42: even if he finds @HJ will go down now|pg||

nt|hawe45:  @D-shift from North looks needed|pg||

nt|snetram:  trudno uwierzyc w licytacje|pg||
nt|eamongall: is there a repechage event in this competition or do the losers just go home and play golf |pg||
nt|bernix: keeping @sK in dummy, just in case he needs a 2nd ruff|pg||
nt|dburn: well judged|pg||
nt|petergill: West needs perfect cards for slam - Axx, AQxx, xxx, Qxx - so she wisely passes  |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: declarer not with many tricks looks an imposible contract|pg||
nt|skaftij:  No, west way to strong 4 4@h|pg||
pc|d2|nt|eweber: a festival for the weak NT players who find their @s fit :)|pg||
nt|athene: not at all easy for north to lead from Qxx round to Jxx though|pg||
nt|haans: He asked and got NO|pg||
nt|pitiful:  this is a nice spot for e-w|pg||
nt|ftpe: 3 nt was hard bid|pg||
nt|xenya: normal to bid 3N on 25 points, but the game is very thin|pg||
nt|ftpe: punish will come, even if lucky lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Fleisher-Kamil, Weinstein-Levin, Stansby-Martel|pg||
nt|tomi2:  I am not a fan of redoubles with hands that have only one thing to say... "I have support and some values". Redouble for me should mean "I want to double the opps" but it is so unlikely for W that he will get opps...|pg||
nt|brolucius: If you play negative bids over a double, you need to use redouble more - I guess.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Funnily enough this is all about @HQ, is it now?|pg||
nt|othered1: I prefer redouble denies fit, unless game force.|pg||
nt|tomi2:  more often opps will preempt you in spades and partner will not know about your fit when its his turn to bid. You should have a bid in your system to show a constructive or invitational raise directly|pg||
nt|tomi2:  best again is to use transfers :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: transfers are useful in many sequences but no-one ever seems to write a magazine article about them. (Must prefer to keep the advantages to themselves...)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Gromöller is a hot favourite to go down. He must lose two spades and one diamond, and why would he play South for @HQ after the take-out double?|pg||
nt|koksoy: kýsalarak  4@S  yapabilir..  oynayan  icin  hersey  iyi...    pik  vermeyebilir|pg||

nt|odysseus69: are tese the cards they are bidding?|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3NT would have had a better chance. The cards lie quite well.|pg||
nt|barnets: why not?|pg||
nt|barnets: 3@H invite with hearts|pg||
nt|barnets: 3@S is forcing|pg||
nt|barnets: 3N lets try it|pg||
nt|bagman: A standard transfer sequence to good 4@S|pg||
pc|sA|nt|rnmalik: and thought well:)|pg||
nt|tomi2:  my gues is: his intention was "pd pls bid 3nt with a spade stopper"|pg||
nt|athene: it could easily give tricks away|pg||
nt|athene: i assume that @D4 is the @H4|pg||
nt|hawe45:  East found the shift|pg||
nt|andreasw:  if denmark wins now free beer for all|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: good question Eamon - most events have a final B with the top x teams allowed back in ... not sure|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 9 tricks as long as  he gets trumps right|pg||
nt|udo: ja, weil er 2 Treffs auf Keo loswird|pg||
pc|s3|nt|xenya: N was sort of endplayed on the lead -- any suit he might lead (except @Cs) gives away a trick|pg||
nt|psridhar: are they saving vul vs nv on a 4-4? looks 500 to me|pg||
nt|bernix: there is a transnational. i'd prefer golf|pg||
pc|s8|nt|paulg:  12 tricks looks a lot at the other table|pg||
nt|haans: play clubs at sonest|pg||
nt|haans: soonest|pg||
nt|vasmar: i think that in hearts there are a lot of tricks for N-S|pg||
nt|pitiful:  should make 10 on the layout|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: after @H North will be told where to go after with a signal|pg||
nt|barnets: 4@H I have a good card in your suit|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3@H looks like a bit of a punt on that suit, when vulnerable. Why not 1NT? Jump shifts are invitational.|pg||
nt|cumino: 3NT was a good feeling by Gold|pg||
nt|odysseus69: over 1s- with Axxxxx- dont please tell me this is the way to bid in 2010- it wont catch on in our street|pg||
nt|barnets: agree better to have the  @H10 in north|pg||
nt|brolucius: And the @HJ. |pg||
nt|odysseus69: and he will now|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the double of 3@S looks a bit of a pairs bid|pg||
nt|suketbombi: lucky !A is sriff|pg||
nt|suketbombi: @HA is stiff|pg||
nt|udo: karo|pg||
pc|s7|pg||

nt|mcarroll: Still tempting though|pg||
nt|shevek: coffee hand is when you need to go to the bathroom and pretend you go to the kitchen :)|pg||
nt|chick: in any case, EW found a makeable game|pg||
nt|chick: won't be easy with the awful trump split, but he has a lot of resources outside of trump|pg||
nt|me argent: tout marche pour lui|pg||
nt|j li: @S8 ist schwer zu interpretieren|pg||
nt|udo: und das driite Ass wird man jeztt wohl eher Süd geben ?|pg||
nt|udo: wenns zum Raten kommt |pg||
pc|dT|nt|haans: true always is|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: good 4@S if -1 =200 for a 420 opps |pg||
nt|ritong: si ça ne marche pas, il lui restera la solution des @ss|pg||
nt|8252: oui, mais bon coloris, à SA, -10 au lieu de - 11 :)|pg||
nt|ritong: mais ça marchera|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Probably as the double must suggest good defensive values for his weak 2|pg||
pc|c3|nt|paulhac:  Looks like 12 on this lead also|pg||
nt|vasmar: now 1NT will go 1 off probably|pg||
nt|vasmar: 4 hearts + 3 Aces|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: but seems a 500 againtx a 420|pg||
nt|mdgraham: after all, can he really underwrite two off?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: how to convert +100 into -730|pg||
nt|skaftij:  switch @s and c and the contract would have been an inelegant 5@s|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mcarroll: not enough dummy entries to trap @HK so will lose 2@D,1@S and the @HK|pg||
nt|haans: sweden DOWN|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3@D should be gf and if so west could have bid 3@S when a slam would be reached|pg||
nt|lechcold: do taryfy chyba brakuje 2 Impów?|pg||
nt|petergill: There are far more hands where 5@H goes down than ones where 6@h makes, excellent judgement by Stockdale|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: I think he will discard a @C|pg||
nt|brolucius: It's a Young Chelsea bid.|pg||
nt|bagman: If N has what he's supposed to have, S might have passed|pg||
nt|barnets: @HA109854|pg||
nt|barnets: the !J makes it a strong jump shift|pg||
nt|barnets: kidding|pg||
nt|suketbombi: this will be over soon|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|athene: declarer really played a diamond, not a trump, at trick 2?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Doesn't seems likely.|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 2@C = mean = @D |pg||
pc|hA|nt|rnmalik: Cant play @S that would squeeze the hand.|pg||
pc|h8|nt|eweber: ... or play 1@c|pg||
nt|lmeili: wd!|pg||
nt|MolvaM: coffee hands are the type of hands that allow you to go and get a cup of coffee from the kitchen without worrying about what extremely clever remark you can do here as commentator|pg||
nt|tomi2:  he knows now @DQ in north, so not many points left for south. maybe some bad clue, but better than no clue ;)|pg||
nt|othered1: north might have ruffed to play @S through, at possible cost of trump trick|pg||
nt|tomi2:  I am told that the systematic meaning of xx is "10+, often no @H fit", hmm|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Club exit won't help declarer|pg||
nt|brolucius: Clever line of play.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: North rates to have more hearts than South after the double, so it would be against the odds to finesse through South|pg||
nt|brolucius: More important to have your hand in the bulletin than to actually win the match.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Versace could easily have had @CQ instead of @HQ|pg||
nt|tomi2:  spades should be 4-4|pg||
nt|othered1: Whne I play @DK from dummy, south's lead was from J10xx|pg||
nt|tomi2:  dias are 2north and 3 south|pg||
nt|lechcold: kto by siê tego spodziewa³? du¿a, przyjemna niespodzianka|pg||
nt|eamongall: but wait ...at first glance greece have 3 plus scores on 18-20 ...there might be some singing yet in austria |pg||
pc|h2|pc|h7|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 1@C is forcing for me :)|pg||
nt|eweber: for those who don't know, Gerben preferably plays Fantunes|pg||
nt|tomi2:  so if clubs are 4-4, north has longer hearts, if 5-3 south has longer hearts|pg||
nt|barnets: probably north could not invite going thru 1N|pg||
nt|cumino: He can survive|pg||
nt|brolucius: I can't see that 3@H is any sort of disciplined bid. I am rather disappointed by it. |pg||
pc|hK|nt|haans: and he should have|pg||
nt|andreasw:  for me it's smooking hand:)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  smoking|pg||
nt|ftpe: 1 nt opening showing 15-17, having 8 as prd, pass is rigth i think, max. is 25 and 8 had no extra|pg||
pc|h9|nt|tomi2:  and having 4 spades is enough for an Italian player to double, can't remember an Italian TO double on 4144 :)|pg||
nt|barnets: so had to make a choice of the lesser of 2 evils|pg||
pc|h3|nt|cumino: sry private|pg||
nt|barnets: if he bids 1N what is his next bid over 2@C or 2@D ?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: this style has 0(zero) (zilch) appeal to e- what happens when pd has 5 clubs facing your Axxx - we can find out on the way back to the hotel|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Murray 2 sets to 1 and at the Oval.....|pg||
nt|odysseus69: break for Murray in 4th|pg||
nt|brolucius: All two-over-one players would have to respond 1NT and then make some bid or other in hearts.|pg||
nt|barnets: and if you cant make an invitational bid in hearts by jumping to 3@H then maybe you should make a direct invite|pg||
nt|koksoy: 9  lu  pikle  yerde  kalacak  rua  trefl  cekip  cakacak...  as  karo  yere  gidip  bir  daha  cakacak..  elden  karoyla  cýkacak|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|roswolf: i think west was a bit lazy here|pg||
nt|eamongall: this one looks like an EW score so no hope there |pg||
nt|barnets: in the old days before 2/1 many would respond 2@h and then 3@H non forcing|pg||
nt|koksoy: umarým  beceremez|pg||
pc|d5|nt|eweber: good duck from East here|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, i think E overbid -- possibly for tactical reasons though|pg||
nt|eamongall: I am looking at any hope of austria getting through |pg||
nt|bernix: losing to monaco was the nail in the coffing|pg||
nt|eamongall: well austria have certainly done their best here ...currently standing at the maximum 25|pg||
nt|brolucius: You can take off a bit for the @DQ-x.|pg||
nt|koksoy: karo  dam  koymadý..  artýk  battý|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer is relying that the heart lead was from JT|pg||
pc|h4|nt|tomi2:  interesting positions, I got 10 msg now with THE best line|pg||
nt|tomi2:  @HQ is a nice falsecard|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Brilliant|pg||
nt|tomi2:  makes GromÃ¶ller believe Lauria has the 3rd heart|pg||
nt|tomi2:  so @D pitches will not work|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Lauria knows where @DA is now|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|ady: will make 12 tricks in spades as they lay|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: board 15 other tavle also in 6@H|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|Walddk2: Gromöller will think Lauria has the last trump|pg||
nt|odysseus69: dont think they play 2 over 1- didnt they stop in 2S earlier - after 1S - 2m-2H-2S|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Iceland in hopeless 4@h on bd 16|pg||
pc|d3|nt|tomi2:  but would have Lauria played the @H9 from 984?|pg||
nt|brolucius: South knows that declarer has a void club, otherwise he would have led towards the @CK.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Would Versace have played a heart from Qxx?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He did|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So East be marked with @SA|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I confess that I don't see the rationale behind the double of 3@S here. The Russian EW pair have had several good boards, so they have no need to panic |pg||
nt|Walddk2: must be|pg||
pc|c4|pc|s2|pg||
nt|ftpe: what tactical reason?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|paulg:  when dummy goes down your first thought would be about making the contract, not two overtricks|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: Line for +1 is @cK finesse @cJ cash @CA and finesse @h9 - all abit risky|pg||
pc|d4|nt|paulhac:  True|pg||

pc|d7|nt|brolucius: A splendid tussle! Worth the entry money on its own.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He could have endplayed Versace with a diamond, but he was deceived by the @HQ return|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is a great hand!|pg||

nt|oleberg: Whack it for 300|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, suddenly the black clouds have cleared away. |pg||
nt|bagman: Without diamond lead, West might have had some chances to make with an endplay|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ady: west wants to clear trumps and then run diamonds|pg||

pc|h9|nt|shevek: declarer might sneak 2 @s tricks and 2@h|pg||

nt|jameslee 2: is it a straight nock-out |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 9 matches on play |pg||
nt|bagman: In the end he would have elimnated clubs and hearts and can play @DA and another|pg||
pc|h5|nt|paulg:  good lead, although a spade would have had the same effect|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Unless defence set up a @C for declarer, they should come to 2@Hs and 2@Cs|pg||
nt|ftpe: after this lead down i think|pg||
nt|8252: encore une donne ou les distibutions ne sont pas urbaines|pg||
nt|petergill: Sorry, that leaves 2 @d's and 2 clubs to lose - I cannot count|pg||

pc|h2|nt|ady: israel got 7 on board 14 in the thin 3NT    Ireland played a part score in hearts|pg||

nt|petergill: so she will go down|pg||
nt|jaapfr: not if she finesses @CQT|pg||
nt|petergill: NS need @C10, but the don't have it|pg||
nt|petergill: they don't have it|pg||
nt|jaapfr: rite you are|pg||
nt|ralfwil: the @d lead was a killer|pg||
nt|petergill: after the hearts are stripped out, if she plays a club to the 8, EW have to be careful|pg||
nt|rmb1: In OR, defence did not play diamond early and were thrown in late.  But we weren't sure where the tenth trick came from|pg||
nt|petergill: then they have to win @CA, play low @D to W, low @d back to the king, then club|pg||
nt|jillan:  same here, 2 rounds of @S ruff the @H and exit in @D|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Why a killer? opened up the defence|pg||
nt|petergill: If @C6 or @C8, low, low, ducked by @CA, then declarer exits in @D to make |pg||

nt|brolucius: Yes, a brave lead. So easy to fish out a heart.|pg||
pc|c3|pg||

nt|rodal f: Wandered if W was good enough for 2@C=good lift in @D, but but NS play 16+ so no|pg||
nt|shevek:  at the moment, ITALY 288,  POLAND  283,  ISRAEL 264.5, ICELAND 255,  RUSSIA  238|pg||
nt|rodal f: Are N to stopnow?|pg||
nt|shevek: http://tinyurl.com/26a6fhk|pg||
nt|lestergold: er do n ot think so north needs very little from pard to make game with heart fit fopund|pg||
nt|rodal f: Tinking. 3 or 4. 3 or 4|pg||
nt|lestergold: and pard ios marked with some values as e/w bidding not very strong|pg||
nt|benjent: If he's having any fantasies about slam, he should give them up now. Smirnov couldn't bid over 1@d, he can't have a great hand|pg||
nt|shevek: 4@h is tough enough|pg||
nt|lestergold: imsure that with his lousy hearts he cannot be having those fantasies|pg||
nt|benjent: Hope is essential to the human condition ... but I agree this would be too hopeful|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dJ|nt|shevek: now the making....|pg||
nt|benjent: you'd think the obvious path is to set up the @c's, but they've already started attacking the entries ... and the @c's don't break|pg||
nt|lestergold: problem of course is with the attack on the entries to dummy via the dim force its a case of can the clubs ne established and enjoyed|pg||
pc|h4|pc|d7|pc|d6|pg||
nt|rodal f: Let's see.S have a supermax by his bid so better make 10 now.|pg||
nt|benjent: You might try to cash @cA, then run @cQ. East can ruff that, but he has the long trump, so it's not that good for the defence|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c9|pc|c4|pc|c2|pg||
nt|lestergold: no must not ruff of course but west ibn with K@c plays nanother dim and hand looks difficult to manage|pg||
nt|benjent: If East ruffs, I think you ditch a @d, and eventually re-rum the @cJ to make 10 tricks|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|lestergold: of copurse tho still has spade as an entry|pg||
nt|rodal f: Any need to ruff so fare?|pg||
nt|rodal f: E will might see that he need the @Hs + a killer at @SA|pg||
nt|shevek: both east and dummy will pitch on this|pg||
nt|shevek: south I mean|pg||
nt|rodal f: And @Ds?:)|pg||
nt|benjent: If East ditches, and West wins and plays a @d, you ruff the @d, cash @hAK and start playing @c winners ... you're ditching @d losers on the @c's as quickly as you can|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think this makes because defence can only get @CK a trump and a dim and all the spades will go away|pg||
nt|shevek: east ruffs with a trump trick, no gain|pg||
nt|lestergold: declarer is in control and this looks like apush therefore and 11 imp win to Germany |pg||
nt|benjent: It's often the right thing to do to ruff in this kind of situation, but it's unattractive when you hold the long trumps|pg||
nt|shevek: very entertaining match, I hope you all agree|pg||
nt|shevek: thanks to my fellow commentators Mike, Ben and Rodal|pg||
nt|lestergold: east is perhaps thinking of ruffing and playing his pard for Q@s|pg||
nt|shevek: to the specs for their input|pg||
nt|lestergold: but i cant see any resopurce here for the defence|pg||
pc|hT|pc|d5|pc|c5|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d8|pc|d4|pc|h3|pg||
nt|rodal f: Tks also to Nicoleta  Ben and Mike. BUT don't for get Michel the splended vug operator and the specs.|pg||
nt|benjent: Now @hA, @hA and run the @cJ. Don't want to leave any annoying @h's in East|pg||
nt|lestergold: declarer still has his worries of course he cant be sure that east ruffed holding 3 trumps|pg||
nt|shevek: http://tinyurl.com/26a6fhk|pg||
nt|lestergold: declarer must i think play for hearts to behave he cannot afford to play another club now for it to be ruffed|pg||
nt|benjent: I think East would have ruffed in a microsecond if he had fewer than 3 @h's, so I think Smirnov will play him for 3|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes i agree|pg||
nt|lestergold: tank a big giveaway of course|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|d2|nt|benjent: gadzooks! odd to ruff the first one but not the second|pg||
nt|shevek: pitching a @d is fine|pg||
nt|benjent: there's a lot of ways to go from here, and they pretty much all work|pg||
nt|rodal f: So easy for us wich can see all the cards.|pg||
nt|shevek: true, any card in his hand...but he's worried about the trump split|pg||
nt|benjent: Since basically all ways work, I think we'd all really like him just to choose one :)|pg||
nt|shevek: if there is a prize for the best hand of the event, it must be board 15, well done Smirnov|pg||

nt|roswolf: and to my fellow commentators the 2 Davids|pg||
nt|santyclz: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/10Ostend/Information.htm is the tourny web-site.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Unusual to say the least?|pg||
nt|shevek: another 3NT|pg||
nt|lechcold: 6@C oznacza³a ¿e partner ma 876 lub 6x, zatem granie waleta nie mia³o sensu |pg||
nt|jkotor: to nie jest udany mecz pary Holenderskiej|pg||
nt|8252: oui|pg||
nt|jillan:  but to be fair she was only in3 so didn't matter much|pg||
nt|oleberg: Ty, and thx all for listening to me|pg||
nt|cumino: Very good lead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 12 imps to Italy on 18 - no surprises there |pg||
mb|p|nt|vasmar: this is tha last board|pg||
nt|haans: he had very little to go on|pg||
nt|pitiful:  will guessthem appear again?|pg||
nt|pitiful:  excllent 6@h here|pg||
nt|mamos: wow it is quite some board|pg||
nt|shevek: north can't get in|pg||
nt|xenya: NOT the best defence by the Russian pair there|pg||
nt|oleberg: 12 tricks in clubs|pg||
nt|ralfwil: when @h are 3-3 yes!|pg||
nt|oleberg: Diamond lead is annoying, but hearts 3-3 sails it home|pg||
nt|bagman: This is the last board of the match|pg||
nt|j li: richtig|pg||
mb|1C|nt|eweber: did I say a few?|pg||
nt|roswolf: hope you enjoyed the show!|pg||

nt|mamos: even at this vul?|pg||
nt|pitiful:  if e-w do get pushed to 7@h will he make it|pg||
nt|pitiful:  9 back to England on 17 |pg||
nt|pitiful:  south wisely did not overcall |pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes|pg||
nt|haans: yes many are not happy if you do not bid a game that need two finesses|pg||
nt|tomi2:  www.bbotv.com is the link for watching several tables at once, now Sementa is in 4@H but Smirnov lead @CA (after Piekarek found two unforced bid with his ace- and kingless hand)|pg||
nt|chick: yes, 11 tricks is possible, but on a spade lead, I would just cash my 10 tricks and go home :)|pg||
nt|snetram:  po transferze 4 kier masz jeden extra bid z rÄkÄ licytujacego 3NT|pg||
nt|8252: il y a du avoir glissé dans les N° à @c|pg||
nt|jillan:  on this hand, declarer gpt a bit tangled up and went one down|pg||
nt|petergill: It is bold of the England, with four current World Champions in their team, to play their young new pair (Stockdale - Brown) in this vital match against one of the five top teams. |pg||
nt|petergill: Admittedly Stockdale - Brown are topping the datums with +0.93 imps/bd|pg||
nt|oleberg: Double must surely be take-out|pg||
nt|odysseus69: last board -thx all - some excitement|pg||
mb|d|nt|aldek: ja bym mlodych nie wystawial na Bala i Zmudzika|pg||

nt|rmb1: I don't know how Stockdate/Brown have performed today but they have pulled their weight in the team|pg||
nt|oleberg: (Diamond-switch is annoying too, but still, hearts 3-3)|pg||
nt|koksoy: son  el..  tesekkürler  herkese  19  no  dan  umutluyuz|pg||
nt|pikonlu: 6 karo dendi obur masada|pg||
nt|koksoy: evet  6  demisler...|pg||
mb|4D|nt|rnmalik: 4@S or 3NT, both the contracts make for NS.|pg||
nt|xenya: spade was led in the OR i'm told|pg||
nt|xenya: W was declarer there|pg||
nt|ftpe: diffcult to lead ace di|pg||
nt|xenya: the @S lead by N looks normal enough, so i withdraw my criticism|pg||
nt|ftpe: withdraw accepted :)|pg||
nt|xenya: and it looks like another disaster for the Russian team is coming|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: well a valiant effort by austria - couldnt do more but apparently not enough so denmark + portugal get thru - finals start tomorrow|pg||
nt|eamongall: I recall the surname ... there was also Fischer ...like the chess players mane |pg||
nt|eamongall: name |pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: are you going to raise to "a lot"?|pg||
nt|paulg:  a kib suggests at least taking the ace of diamonds to cash five clubs first and then play a diamond ... which saves a trick|pg||
nt|haans: the delay after W bid is because SE are on other side of screen|pg||
nt|ftpe: more imps for estonia here, dont think he can manage|pg||
nt|tomi2:  Piekarek ruffed the 3rd @D with no thought to play a skade, now Sementa will get the @H right I think|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: dziêkujê licznym a znakomitym komentatorom oraz jeszcze bardziej licznym kibicom|pg||
nt|petergill: France has taken a 6 VP lead in the Women's event|pg||
nt|oleberg: West will bid 5@C at some point. Unfortunately, East wont raise|pg||
nt|oleberg: (Unfortunate on this layout)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: what is S thinking of? or is it operator?|pg||
nt|oleberg: It might be West thinking|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I hope so:)|pg||
nt|ady: this is last hand of the session     thx all   interesting hands|pg||
mb|4H|nt|rigas_karo: last hand, good luck to both teams for rest of the tournament|pg||
nt|eweber: looking back all the big imps were won by style, board 8, 9, 14|pg||
nt|paulhac:  True|pg||
nt|tomi2:  now he committes himself to 4 level if pd has no @H fit?|pg||
nt|vasmar: for now Austria gets the lead after the unlucky slam of german|pg||
nt|psridhar: abt 25 % game i reckon ( dia 4-2 wih spd 2-2 also ok)|pg||
nt|oleberg: The oprator cannot use the keyboard before both screenmates have bid|pg||
nt|oleberg: That would give away the tempo|pg||
nt|barnets: England have played quite well this match|pg||
nt|mdgraham: horrible hand for EW to bid|pg||
nt|bagman: 1@S by East was transfer to 1NT denying 4 card major|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: 2nd opinion: Rado: 2@H weak 5+@H4+m 3@C pass or correct|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: Last hand Sweden - Israel hope Spect enjoyed , Thx to Vugragher ; coments by hanns , psridhar &    hope to see you  later on |pg||
nt|psridhar: THX ALL THX JAIME|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: next match 13.00   & 16.15   thx to Spectators te most important in BBO |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: good match by both teams as expected very close result |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 13.00 / 16.15 paris time ty Hans |pg||
nt|psridhar: that 3S bid is really stretching too far...N thinking of 4s now|pg||
nt|snetram:  Åwietne zagranie Adama - umozliwi obronÄ 5 kierami 4 pikÃ³w|pg||
nt|jkotor: Cezary chyba nie zrozumia³, ale wysz³o dobrze|pg||
nt|snetram:  dlaczego nie zrozumiaÅ?|pg||
nt|eamongall: Doris Fischer I am told |pg||
nt|petergill: At the other table, the bidding might not have been as it is recorded|pg||
nt|jaapfr: tough decision for N|pg||
nt|petergill: 3NT has chances|pg||
nt|petergill: @D7 is the normal lead to 3NT |pg||
nt|jillan:  may even be easier to play the 4@S|pg||
nt|jaapfr: N considers a 4@C 4@H or pass bid |pg||
nt|jillan:  is west likely to find a heart lead?|pg||
nt|petergill: Other table : 1@D showed hearts and 1@H was takeout of hearts|pg||
nt|petergill: No chance of a @h lead to 3NT - East showed 6 @d's, did not show hearts|pg||
nt|odysseus69: quiet board to finish|pg||
nt|barnets: and it will be a close result|pg||
nt|odysseus69: have to leave- bye all|pg||
mb|p|nt|motu: wladow does not know bids like 2NT in such situations|pg||
nt|vasmar: but board 19 will give back the lead to Germany i beleive|pg||
nt|MolvaM: last hand of the match here now|pg||
nt|oleberg: West is doing what he can, to get to 6@C|pg||
nt|oleberg: It helps him, that he is limited to 15 points, partner will know the nature of his hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|pitiful:  doubled was the stripe tailed ape|pg||
nt|mamos: wow  was that striped ape do you think|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: thx to our commentators eamonn, justin, bernard - vugraph operator and hope to see you all tomorrow for the finals round 1|pg||
nt|jillan:  so this might make then :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4@C the lesser bid so pass or 4@H|pg||
nt|petergill: West (likely) or East (unlikely) will need to find a heart switch, if East puts up @DK on a low @d elad|pg||
nt|barnets: bye victor|pg||
nt|brolucius: So have the Italians at this table. There was that diamond lead against 3NT and the 7@D that they bid. |pg||
nt|bagman: bye|pg||
nt|ozgull: grand þlem bulundu galiba|pg||
nt|koksoy: 7@S  cok  güzel  kont rat...  karolar  iyiyse  oluyor..  o  ve  pikler  kötü  ama  kör  pasý  geciyor|pg||
nt|suketbombi: last hand comming up thanks David Skaftij and all the wonderful kibzers. Thanks to the Vu-Graph Opertator for the great Job.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lmeili: never argue with DR Waldow :)|pg||
nt|reisig: disaster coming|pg||
nt|haans: dont ask|pg||
nt|vasmar: S is happy to pass|pg||
nt|roswolf: east will pass?he is normally very reluctant to pass an invitation|pg||
nt|mcarroll: on 19 4@S was made in Open, to account for most of the lead held by Bulgaria|pg||
nt|pitiful:  or at least he will claim that later|pg||
nt|jaapfr: @H|pg||
nt|yusufb: seninkiler %1 zaten|pg||
nt|riccho: ich danke allen, die hier zugeschaut haben. Meinen Mitkommentatoren danke ich ebenfalls sehr und dem Operator, der wie immer einen exzellenten Job gamcht hat|pg||
nt|riccho: und wünsche noch einen schönes Wochenende :)|pg||
pc|sA|nt|cumino: sry|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: @s @h @d @c last hand  Bye from Ostend @c @d @h @s|pg||
nt|iyer7550: looks like norway will score a moral victory|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: dobrze, ¿e tu sêdziowie nie musz¹ uznawaæ strzelonych goli |pg||
nt|jkotor: bez pasa Adama po 1@h-2@h-? te¿ mo¿na graæ transferami|pg||
nt|jkotor: 2@s = GF z fitem, 2ba=@c, 3@c=@d, 3@d=INV z fitem, 3@h=przepych|pg||
nt|petergill: Might be hard (impossible) to put @DK on 1D!0 = unlucky|pg||
nt|oleberg: 5NT = Pick a slam (I sincerely hope)|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer has only one entry to dummy as the club finesse is not working|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mamos: lol|pg||
nt|MolvaM: many thanks to all our commentators and our specs for their valuable guidance|pg||
nt|haans: 3@S must have been premptive|pg||
nt|marlowepi: je m'etonne a la ligne de jeu, notamment le deuxieme tour d'atout avant de jouer trefle et coeur pour limiter la note si les atouts sont mal partages|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|andersk: calm finish, so the results as it stands now, is 15-15 in VP|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Its Stayman Jim, but not as we know it?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a @h lead was Killing|pg||
nt|jaapfr: duck??|pg||
nt|petergill: @D5 = discouraging, as South is "marked' with @DAQJ|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Thx vugraph operator, fellow commentaros Raju and David and specs not least|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ady: might be 1 too high    depends on view in trumps|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: very much so 0-6  4 card is the maximum preempitve |pg||
nt|psridhar: but that 3s worked in pushing Freding into the startosphere 4D|pg||
pc|h2|nt|tomi2:  trump lead|pg||
nt|lechcold: wygl¹da ¿e mo¿emy Holendrom odpisaæ jeszcze kilka VP|pg||
nt|petergill: This swing will halve the margin|pg||
nt|oleberg: Payback for board 14, where Iceland in open room bid and made a very lucky 6@S|pg||
nt|ralfwil: W will make this, so thanks all and I wish you all a nice Wednesday evening:)|pg||
nt|bagman: W strongly suspecting that the @DQ is wrong|pg||
pc|hA|nt|xenya: N doubled on slender values but 4-4-4-1, and S was happy to pass|pg||
nt|koksoy: 5 @C  diyerek  trefl  haric  aslarý  sordu .. 5nt=  2as  ve  dam  var..  artýk  7  demek  kolay|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|eweber: if I weren't an aggressive bidder I would consider to convert after watching this match :)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  i would like to back to board 4 and 11 tricks was made!!!!!:)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: thanks andreas, nicoleta|pg||
nt|chick: This is the last board for this table,  3 yet to score|pg||
nt|mdgraham: maybe West could rebid 1NT, but personally I loathe it - any preferences? 2@d seems normal enough |pg||
nt|ozgull: kýsmet 7 karo dediler|pg||
nt|koksoy: cok  güzel  konustular|pg||
nt|ozgull: bir önceki el yani|pg||
nt|koksoy: yapma  ya..|pg||
nt|koksoy: 4-0  pik  gözükünce  kör  empasý  mecburi...  karolar  yetmiyor|pg||
pc|c4|nt|pitiful:  great hand to finish with|pg||
nt|pitiful:  well done to the dutch, they played very well|pg||
nt|pitiful:  after a slow start they are motoring |pg||
nt|mamos: the idea is you double 5 Level to stop them bidding Six then if they redouble you vanish to your save like a stripe tailed ape vanishing up a tree|pg||
nt|aldek: anyhow, great entertainment|pg||
nt|pitiful:  thanks to all watching|pg||
nt|pitiful:  bye now|pg||
nt|mamos: yes thsanks all|pg||
nt|aldek: till next time|pg||
nt|nyg8:  5HX was striptail monkey - i.e. stop then from gettnig to 6|pg||
nt|psridhar: bd 19 Sweden did reach their 'game'|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: both match are no time penalty 3 minutes left |pg||
nt|haans: bye all see you :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Tren bien maniement des @H Christian - Nord pourrait avoir 10 ou Valet sec|pg||
nt|ralfwil: bye!|pg||
nt|oleberg: And a nice vening to you and everybody else|pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: thanks all...|pg||
nt|maribelxx: another reason for the day being quiet is midsummer... all shops are closed, no public transport, people flee from cities to spend a few days in the country|pg||
nt|chick: Thanks to our excellent vugraph operator,  Michel Machiels, for a great job!!  :)|pg||
nt|jkotor: po pasie uzna³, ¿e ka¿da licytacja MUSI byæ z fitem|pg||
nt|ritong: il faudrait verifier si une ligne de jeu " méfiante" ne risque pas le contrat en cas de partages normaux|pg||
nt|marlowepi: il y avait une probabilite miniscule que N ait 5 coeurs (crainte de promotion d'atout), car il avait passe en troisieme aux couleurs favorables et il a deja le roi de pique en ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: plaus de ses coeurs--au moins|pg||
nt|ritong: bien  allons voir ce qui se passe dans l autre salle|pg||
pc|cA|nt|rnmalik: good bridge, 20 boards and such little difference.|pg||
nt|paulhac:  North might well have bid over 2@H|pg||
nt|ady: good guess|pg||
nt|maribelxx: sorry :(|pg||
nt|santyclz: Thanks all, see you soon.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: ok andreas we analyze that board and send you the results by a sealed envelope|pg||
nt|tomi2:  not difficult after Piekarek has told him his exact shape...|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i would at least think a longer time as E to see how this can go down on trick 1|pg||
nt|odysseus69: looks normal auction|pg||
nt|koksoy: simdi  düsünüyor  ama  birazdan  hýzlanacak|pg||
nt|koksoy: artýk  kör  pasý  mecburi|pg||
nt|bagman: To make declarer needs luck in both spades and clubs|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|haans: 9.30 central time tomorrow|pg||
nt|shevek: thx Murat, Andreas, everyone|pg||
nt|andreasw:  :) thx everyone was fun|pg||
nt|MolvaM: this room is finished. everybody invited to the Open room to finish the match. thanks...|pg||
nt|andreasw:  bye everyone|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: other table playing 2nt west |pg||
nt|brolucius: If the @DK lead picks up a big number we will have a near-draw, very creditable. |pg||
nt|barnets: for those interested in extraordinary bridge stories , scandal and hands I have anew wbsite at www.shenkinbridge.com and a club free to join|pg||
nt|bagman: now he probably goes 3 down making only his 4 top tricks he had in the beginning|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|eweber: this is the last board on this table, but we will have the chance to watch the last 5 in the open|pg||
nt|psridhar: that 2nt wont be a success either|pg||
nt|ralfwil: sry for my break. serious net problems (WAN)|pg||
nt|bagman: South should not consider ducking this because he still has the @C9|pg||
pc|d3|nt|ralfwil: When I see the figures, perhaps as well as a swede:)|pg||
nt|bagman: The defense need to play spades at some point so declarer is likely to go only 2 down|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ady: thx all|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|koksoy: bütün  seyirciler  7@D  ya  kýzýyorlar...  karolar 2-2  olsaydý  herkes  oleyy  diyecekti|pg||
nt|udo: danke Dich auch :):):|pg||
pc|d4|nt|Gerben42: thanks to our excellent operator in Oostende in Belgium!|pg||
nt|ady: now can set up 4th club to discard a diamond|pg||
nt|mcarroll: This convention (Rado) seems to have many names, we call it both Tartan and Pender and I believe it has other names|pg||
nt|psridhar: the hand belongs to NS in spds|pg||
nt|brolucius: Thanks for watching!|pg||
nt|othered1: Thanks everyone and bye for now.|pg||
nt|barnets: where do they stand ?|pg||
nt|petergill: Sorry, heart swich will beat it now |pg||
nt|petergill: I cannot count|pg||
nt|jaapfr: but think you rite here peter|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes only 8 tricks with a @h shift|pg||
nt|jillan:  she needed to finesse the @C with the 8|pg||
nt|ralfwil: yes Jill!|pg||
nt|koksoy: bricte kýsa  vadede  kazananý  bizim  degil  rakiplerimizin  ellerindeki  dagýlýmlar  belirleyebilir|pg||
pc|h4|nt|Gerben42: and also many thanks to my co-commentator Elke Weber|pg||
nt|xenya: so 2 big swings on the last 2 hands to Estonia|pg||
nt|jaapfr: too tough the @C8|pg||
pc|d2|nt|vasmar: ruff and spade back|pg||
nt|iyer7550: well done michael|pg||

nt|barnets: aand thanks to all the specs for their valuable input|pg||
nt|bagman: thx all|pg||
nt|barnets: bye all|pg||
nt|brolucius: Thanks for watching!|pg||
nt|bagman: When North cashes the hearts West is going to be strip squeezed. He cannot unguard the @DJ so he have to discard a spade|pg||
nt|bagman: North endplays West with a spade who is forced to lead from his J3 of diamonds to North's Q8|pg||
pc|h6|nt|paulhac:  But with soft values and a singleton I can see why he passed|pg||
nt|ady: now no need|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: a @d there might have beaten it with a @C return ...|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|paulg:  i'm surprised that 1@s was not opened in the other room|pg||
nt|motu: maybe only 800|pg||
nt|petergill: West needs to switch to hearts, not play 1D's and partner did discourage 1d's  - can she read @D5 as high discouraging?|pg||
nt|jillan:  Brownis doing good discarding all her @D|pg||
nt|petergill: 1D  and 1d = @ds|pg||
nt|petergill: Yes, telling aprtnet to play 1Hs not 1|pg||
nt|petergill: @D's|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|Gerben42: 10 more days of European Championships still to come, and American qualifying for Bermuda Bowl inbetween|pg||
nt|eweber: and to my co-commentator Gerben Dirksen|pg||

nt|eweber: and of course thanks to the audience for valuable hints and patience when I told something wrong|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 2011 the Bermuda Bowl, Venice Cup and Seniors Bowl will be in Eindhoven, NL|pg||
