nt|lestergold: Hi Mike|pg||
nt|paulg:  3@d is a mixed raise, whatever that means|pg||
nt|haans: none ever know what mixed is|pg||
nt|paulg:  four trumps and another useful card is normal I guess|pg||
nt|haans: here a believer in @D singel|pg||
nt|paulg:  Fredin may bid 3@s more for the lead than anything else|pg||

mb|2H|nt|dimi: Welcome to the 50th european team championship from Ostend in Belgium. This is the 5th day of the open event. |pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: Hello all and welcome.|pg||
nt|haans: yes my choice|pg||
nt|mamos: North has woken up in a frisky mood|pg||
nt|eweber: hello everyone|pg||
nt|mamos: south thinks Oh gawd here we go again|pg||
nt|daman: I guess we have started|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|lestergold: well decision for Towsend at trick 1|pg||
mb|p|nt|eweber: 2@s shows 4-9 and Sabine is not known for underbidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: This appears to be doomed contract.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: on the placement of cards 4@H has a good play for NS.|pg||
nt|dimi: Iceland (200 VP) the current leader of group A is facing Germany (168.5 VP) the fifth of group A |pg||
nt|rnmalik: partial available both sides.|pg||
nt|daman: welcome|pg||
nt|sga1: Hi all.|pg||
nt|daman: perhaps we can get player's names at some point|pg||
nt|sga1: 1@s was a canape bid? any one|pg||
pc|d4|nt|ady: looks aty least down 1     had a place with spade finesse right|pg||
nt|eweber: maybe I should add that it shows @s+m|pg||
nt|Gerben42: hello all!|pg||
mc|11|nt|haans: 4@D was an invite|pg||
nt|mamos: 2@S shows 5+ 5+ minor 4-9 so about as expected i guess|pg||
nt|arvidsson: De spelar ett starkklöver system (väldigt likt Bernys system) så mycket relä och många zz har vi framför oss)|pg||
nt|daman: NS should make an overtrick|pg||

mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2H|mb|p|nt|april7: a makeble contract of 3 NT but not easy to reach and to make|pg||
nt|marcsmith: make game if declarer guesses trumps, but why should he|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|marcsmith: 4H makes it he guesses hearts since clubs are Jxx onside|pg||
pc|sT|nt|marcsmith: sensible pass from East at this vul tho|pg||
nt|marcsmith: one option is to play spade AQ pitching a diamond and take a heart finesses|pg||

nt|drorp: Hi all|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s4|pc|d4|pc|s9|pg||

nt|gohar: yes|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Men man skall komma ihåg att det är bra mycket enklare för oss som ser alla händer|pg||
nt|hawe45:  A quiet start, it seems |pg||
nt|daman: nicely played|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk1: You must connect to the open room|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Hans|pg||
nt|haans: not as bloody as i first believed|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: you should try to win the matches versus the strong teams in the round robin, because those results count later in the final|pg||
nt|mikael_w: hjälper inte att spela @c då|pg||
nt|arvidsson: tursamt nog ser vi alla händer, gör att vi ibland kan analysera rätt :)|pg||
nt|affe82: utspelet gjorde väl i praktiken att s alltid var hemma|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I make coffee|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: Hi Nicoleta|pg||
nt|haans: some say that 1/3 of all IMPs you get in defense|pg||
nt|rnmalik: NT-non vul 11-14?|pg||
nt|paulg:  both teams are (almost) certain to qualify for the second stage, so the matches against the other qualifiers are doubled important as the score will be carried over|pg||
nt|dimi: at the other table Baldursson-Jonsson is facing Pikarek-Smirnov|pg||
mb|1H|nt|Walddk1: You have starated your own broadcast|pg||
nt|xenya: Nicoleta :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/w can make 4@h but will of course be outbid by N/S in spades but at these colours they have good save|pg||
nt|mamos: no it woke us all up with a bang|pg||
nt|dimi: Wladow-Elinescu play a strong @c-system with strong NT |pg||
nt|Gerben42: Baldursson - Jonsson were part of the 1991 Bermuda Bowl team|pg||
nt|mikael_w: ja, efter utspelet så var det nog tungbetat om spelföraren spelade rätt|pg||
nt|affe82: ew ending up in 3@c after a 3rd hand oping by W?|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: no cc for this pair|pg||
mb|1S|nt|vbman: how come 2 cl down 3?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: difficult hand to bid, the lower contract the better.|pg||
nt|ady: OR stopped in part score so 5 imps for Russia|pg||
nt|copeyj: Hi All|pg||
nt|h_karluk: lucky 4@s in case allowed|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Hi, welcome Simon|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 6D NS|pg||
nt|lestergold: played by N |pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@S seems a bit drastic|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but the Norht dummy is what you might call suitable |pg||
nt|lestergold: well the upside is that it shuts e/w out whop have good saves|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@s = 7-10 5@s 4m|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Enver Köksoy|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: dubious overcall      but 4@S on|pg||
mb|2H|nt|Walddk1: Pls look at this|pg||
nt|copeyj: you would have to tie south down with piano wire to get him to pass 4@S|pg||
nt|ady: Townsend  4NT   looking for a minor suit contract |pg||
nt|lestergold: double fit hands are the ones you want to declarer|pg||
nt|lestergold: especially before opps find out they have double fit|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the S heart holding is not one that makes 4S an appetizing call. but of course it could easy work well, e.g. by driving EW too high or by keeping thgem from finding their club game ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: or slam|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the reality is that even though NS have a cold slam, they are never going to get to them 4-4 fit unless N is able to open 1NT or the like. with E dealer, you wouldnt expect one top ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: pair in a hundred to reach 6D|pg||
nt|haans: fallenius did not like it|pg||
nt|sga1: Another 4@h contract.|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: North soon to bid|pg||
nt|xenya: 2@C is weak with @Ds -- or something else maybe|pg||
nt|haans: 2@C weak @D or strong have followers|pg||
nt|xenya: yes|pg||
nt|pitiful:  west pleased not to be doubled|pg||
nt|eweber: a bidding sequence one should have discussed in a partnership|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 2@D seems light at these colors|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: well gromov has 5/6 bicolors with a void and decent values|pg||
nt|rmb1: 6@C makes even on @H lead because defence can not cash second heart|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 9 top tricks at NT.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Difficult hand to bid, the lower the contract the better.|pg||
nt|koksoy: hello  evrybody|pg||
nt|daman: noooooooooooooooooo|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: must have been misplayed.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 7 tricks on @S hook.|pg||

nt|rnmalik: hi|pg||
nt|sga1: No|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Good afternoon all|pg||
nt|daman: partscore|pg||
nt|daman: Hi Mike|pg||
nt|sga1: Hi Mike|pg||
pc|c2|nt|rnmalik: On the placement of cards EW can make 9 tricks at NT.|pg||
nt|rmb1: .. but not on a diamond lead|pg||
nt|h_karluk: this won't be easy|pg||
nt|copeyj: gromov will possibly bid 6@S|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i doubt|pg||
nt|copeyj: can't be expensive and the vulnerability is right|pg||
nt|copeyj: Hello all - sorry I am a bit late|pg||
nt|mamos: South probably seen her partner's protective doubles  before :)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  hello to all|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: iceland here is playing a variable no trump range and transfer bid over a 1 cl opening|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Här väljer N att inte fråga efter @s färgen|pg||
pc|c3|nt|xenya: likely 1 down|pg||
nt|haans: good bidding by South|pg||
nt|h_karluk: already showed intentions and knows his p is not blind|pg||
nt|benjy:  Would you guys bid 3@S with the south hand? Obviously if partner has a fit then you might make a game, but if partner doesn't do you really want him passing or converting to 4@D? Certainly not clear in my opinion.|pg||
nt|pitiful:  looks like 4 or 5  tricks |pg||
nt|arvidsson: 3 @D is the final contract, do you agree on bidding 3 @D Fredrik?|pg||
pc|cK|nt|xenya: NS can make 1N or 2@S|pg||
nt|h_karluk: omg|pg||
nt|copeyj: he cant pass 6@D|pg||
nt|haans: Open CC http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/docdefault.asp?page=OpenTeams&start=c%3A%5Cinetpub%5Cwwwroot%5Cecatsbridge%5Cdocuments%5Cfiles%5CMay |pg||
nt|eweber: 1x ppx 1NT and 1x X pp 1NT, especially when you play weak NT|pg||
nt|andreasw:  down 3 i think how did they go down in other table?|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|Gerben42: the 11th trick needs to come from @C|pg||
nt|sga1: Good to stayout of 4@h as it doesn't make.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: bidding looks quite normal|pg||
nt|daman: not the best lead|pg||
nt|sga1: If E had bid 2NT which is not a bad bid, they would be overboard.|pg||
nt|daman: a @D would have been helpful|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|copeyj: he has no idea if it is cold or no play|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: can he avoid 2 club looser?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: could we have the name sof the players please operator?|pg||
pc|dA|nt|copeyj: but 6@S cheap insurance|pg||
nt|sga1: Both tables playing the same contract :)|pg||
pc|d6|nt|h_karluk: well well|pg||
nt|h_karluk: groans and grimaces barred, scowling free :)|pg||
nt|haans: i have played relays 3nt never relay|pg||
nt|paulg:  i thought it was a big call|pg||
nt|gohar: they deserve penality|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|copeyj: one advantage of townsend bidding 6@D quickly and confidently|pg||
nt|ady: 300 a decent score for englanf in view of the fact they werer in a minus situation in 6@D|pg||
nt|Gerben42: given the 5-5 distribution he can play Ace and low @C!|pg||
nt|affe82: vilket är ett gott avvägande med den fördelningen i mitt tycke|pg||
pc|hA|nt|haans: not impressed|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 4@S with @D lead would not make|pg||
nt|haans: nor in Fallanius mind|pg||
nt|pitiful:  J@h swicth would be pretty|pg||
nt|arvidsson: med 4-3-3-3 tycker jag det är ett bra val|pg||
nt|arvidsson: it will definitly go off 1 or 2 depending on play|pg||
pc|h8|nt|pitiful:  !q @d from south might have been clearer|pg||
nt|pitiful:  Q@d|pg||
pc|h2|nt|copeyj: 3 inescapable losers - nothing to the play|pg||
nt|Walddk7: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/Events/ebl/2010ostend/default.asp  for convention cards and other useful information|pg||
nt|copeyj: Townsend & Gold had the fortunate position of sitting out the first match today - fortunate because it was a 0930 start - far too early for your average bridge player :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: as it is 5@C also makes. |pg||
nt|benjy:  This will be another useful pickup for the English|pg||
nt|paulg:  especially as 3@h often has spades, as when you don't have spades then you bid game or pass|pg||
nt|benjy:  I would pass as even when partner has a fit there is no guarantee of going plus. A singleton in partner's suit is very defensive|pg||
nt|haans: whith u|pg||
nt|haans: with|pg||
nt|hedyg: went down on a @c lead|pg||
nt|gohar: yes|pg||
nt|andreasw:  1 sek brb|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|pitiful:  well done|pg||
nt|hawe45:  To bid ANYTHING with the West-hand is wrong|pg||
nt|hedyg: he could have just ducked the @c and let E ruff and make it|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@H seems to be makeable and that is 620, lets see|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes 4@h should have been won|pg||
nt|hedyg: ducking the @c lead he loses 1@c 1ruff and 1@s|pg||
nt|gohar: yes @c lead|pg||
nt|gohar: down 3 ...|pg||
nt|gohar: 4@h better|pg||
nt|andreasw:  even going up then draw 2@d 2@h ruff a @d and 10 trick's|pg||
nt|affe82: troliga 10 här|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Med 4-3-3-3 tycker jag att det ofta är rätt i partävling, men i lagtävling föredrar jag nog en högfärgsfråga faktiskt|pg||
pc|hK|nt|copeyj: 5@SX next door so looks like 5 back to England for a tied ball game|pg||
nt|haans: ok so a make but nothing to be impressed about|pg||
nt|arvidsson: faran är om partnen har 5 kortshögfärg|pg||
nt|mikael_w: det är inte förbjudet att öppna med Ax i @h med 2 NT, Och varför ta risken|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hJ|nt|haans: when 2!1C may be weak@D opps have more option the just 2@D weak|pg||
nt|vbman: nice spot|pg||
nt|gohar: what abt the other table?|pg||
nt|mikael_w: eller @c för den delen|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|Gerben42: Elinescu can then drop the @CJ under the A|pg||
pc|hT|nt|haans: Relays Curse |pg||
nt|arvidsson: vilket man tyvärr får ha i 2nt, men i regel brukar jag tänka kan nt vara rätt? då bjuder jag nt (inget bra tips att ta efter)|pg||
pc|d8|nt|Walddk4: Typo in South's name, operator   BLAKSET   with a  K|pg||
nt|xenya: operator, S's name is incorrect -- should be Blakset?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Thank you|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and perhaps you can insert result on board 1 manually?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Board 1, no more flat 4@H wrong sided and with @D lead -1.|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: elimination of spades and hearts and then the queen of cl|pg||
nt|arvidsson: ok no guesses left for N and no squeeze so 1 of, better for defence would earlier on attacking @H |pg||
pc|d5|nt|paulg:  partner is also still there over 3@H, and with two hearts can always make a takeout double with a decent overcall|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|haans: you have to bid spades yourselves only you know u have 6|pg||
pc|sK|nt|arvidsson: instead of returning @D a @H would mist likley give 2 off|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sA|nt|xenya: i don't believe that|pg||
nt|pitiful:  nice defence |pg||
nt|gohar: 2 more and its over:)|pg||

pc|s3|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|arvidsson: man kan måla upp mängder med händer då det är rätt att spela nt kontra spader och vice versa, frågan är hur tar man reda på allt innan det är försent ?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @D are placed in a very friendly position. The defense could take 3@S and a @H for -1.|pg||

nt|drorp: yea|pg||
nt|marcsmith: ok|pg||
nt|drorp: i kinda like that 1NT call|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|mb|p|nt|marcsmith: seems fairly normal - best of bad options|pg||
mb|3D|nt|nyg8:  3d is a bit risky|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|3H|nt|drorp: 3@D call might seem odd, but when he holds 4 hearts and knows partner is stiff, it's fairly safe|pg||
mb|p|nt|marcsmith: sure, but defending 2H doesn't look like a winning option|pg||
mb|p|nt|april7: should pass although not vul|pg||
mb|p|nt|marcsmith: Eastmight have competed to 4D|pg||
nt|april7: its against the "law"|pg||
pc|dK|nt|marcsmith: 5D is making if you guess trumps|pg||
nt|nyg8:  so is 3H against the Law|pg||
nt|marcsmith: yes|pg||
pc|dA|nt|drorp: i think you have to guess the clubs aswell otherwise too many losers|pg||
pc|d6|pc|d5|pg||
nt|marcsmith: probably|pg||
nt|marcsmith: 3H might have been smacked for at least 300|pg||

pc|s2|pc|sK|pc|sA|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|dJ|pc|d2|pc|d7|pg||
nt|marcsmith: declarer can probably set up SJ for a 7th trick tho|pg||
nt|nyg8:  he should of played clubs not S as the A is obviously off side|pg||
nt|april7: now best is K of @C, but not so easy to do|pg||
nt|marcsmith: or trumps|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s4|pc|s8|pc|s7|pg||
nt|marcsmith: but declarer can win in hand and lead towards SJ while dummy still has a trump entry anyway|pg||
nt|april7: will probably play small @H|pg||
nt|marcsmith: now declarer has 4 trumps, 2 aces and SJ for 2 down|pg||
pc|dT|nt|april7: now less down|pg||
nt|nyg8:  poor D|pg||
pc|c4|pc|d3|nt|marcsmith: makes no difference|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|drorp: can escape for 1 off now|pg||
nt|marcsmith: probably yes|pg||

nt|mamos: this match must involve the some of the most experienced Women players in Europe|pg||

nt|hedyg: for their system it is|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I see 10 tricks - in @H|pg||
nt|Gerben42: first to reach 5@D and second to make it|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: i woudnt recomend the 2 dia overcall, bec being vulnerble there is no chance for declaring this hand|pg||
nt|affe82: i 4@s hade @d 9 legat i disken efter 0.1 vilket gjort det kämpigt. om vi haller med generellt eller inte sa kan vi hursom inte klaga pa resultatet.|pg||

mb|1H!|nt|henryb:  GM all, or rather good afternoon where you are|pg||
mb|d|nt|rnmalik: 4@S for EW, cards are nicely placed with @C 3/3.|pg||
nt|copeyj: strong @C from Dubinin|pg||
nt|rmb1: South following the sound defence against slams - cash your aces and wait for your trump trick(s)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: likely 3n for EW|pg||
nt|marlowepi: even if it goes 1H-1S-P-2H and S gets to bid Ds, the contract is wrongsided. an auction that places declaration of Ds in N hand is hard to construct|pg||
nt|pitiful:  we have a Roland slam now|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes Hans|pg||
nt|dimi: 11 tricks in @h for NS|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: coffee hand- at least should be|pg||
nt|arvidsson: du är en gambler du Micke :) vi kan sammanfatta att det är en fråga om stil nysan hamnade till slut i 4 @S|pg||
nt|mikael_w: kommer inte att bli lätt för N/S att stanna under 4 @s här|pg||
nt|arvidsson: ok west did discard a Heart so declarar made, did not even see that as an possibility|pg||
nt|sga1: May be another contract in @hs unless EW out bid NS.|pg||
mb|2H|nt|hawe45:  Sorry @S...!|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: 2@H two-suiter???|pg||
nt|marlowepi: welcome simon|pg||
nt|hedyg: oh lol|pg||
nt|gohar: 2@s was not his bid i think,,,but they play like this|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This board|pg||
nt|gohar: yes|pg||
nt|Gerben42: standard bidding would be 4@D transfer, because 2@D 2@H 4@H would show slam interest|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Fast som en åskådare precis sa :) Kanske 3 NT igen, och denna gången är det verkligen rätt|pg||
nt|arvidsson: på denna gör man 3nt, men går det att bjuda ?|pg||
nt|sga1: Is the double right or 2@D was the call.|pg||
nt|sga1: I would prefer 2@D overcall.|pg||
mb|p|nt|shevek: 7-10(11) 5], not 4[|pg||
nt|xenya: unless something very unusual happened |pg||
nt|shevek: 5@h not 4@s|pg||
nt|h_karluk: very lucky diamonds for the declarer|pg||
nt|Walddk7: I am trying to make our operator insert a  D  in West's name|pg||
mb|3D|nt|h_karluk: pass by Easr quite interesting, perhaps part of their CC|pg||
nt|h_karluk: *East|pg||
nt|ady: e/w have 3NT   easy if playing diamonds from the top   and have other chances even if diamonds are 4-1|pg||
nt|copeyj: Townsend probably thinks e/w have big things on - he will be disappointed in that respect but they are not going to be able to play in 3N now it seems to me|pg||
nt|copeyj: i had duties getting cereal bars for a certain D Gold|pg||
nt|Walddk7: TOWNSEND|pg||
nt|pitiful:  strong @c by south|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@d now?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This should lead to an easy 4 @S|pg||
nt|koksoy: 2or  3@H  by  N is  my guess|pg||
nt|daman: I like 2@D|pg||
nt|henryb:  Now in the US no one would double 1@h with the W hand: 2@d or pass would be the common choices|pg||
mb|p|nt|gohar: 4@s,,,,,makes|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I allready se East lead the @D QUEEN..|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: well not clubs either :)|pg||
nt|shevek: Ron and Blakset play Xfer openings (1@d = @h, 1@h = @ss)|pg||
nt|shevek: 2@h = 5+@h, denies @ss|pg||
nt|shevek: I guess 2@s would've been relay (N/A)|pg||
nt|xenya: imaginative lead by Fredin -- maybe now it's makeable? |pg||
nt|xenya: yes|pg||
nt|shevek: system cards @@  http://tinyurl.com/29ud57z|pg||
nt|h_karluk: seems reop X would help East to visualize|pg||
nt|copeyj: although they can make 5@D too |pg||
nt|h_karluk: however still makes 5@d|pg||
nt|ady: can make 12 tricks|pg||
nt|h_karluk: what a slam|pg||
nt|ady: is possible 4 diamonds passed out|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Good morning to Henry Bethe|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Sorry for the typo in the N-S team name, nothing we can do about it now I'm afraid|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 6@C would become tough with @H placement and 3NT makes against any defense.|pg||
nt|mamos: 1NT is Relay I think|pg||
nt|pitiful:  slam is likely to make if they get there|pg||
nt|eweber: NS plays a variable NT, NT opening nv 1st and 2nd seat 10-12|pg||
nt|daman: the Italians always double with those hands    like to show points rather than shape|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: Good morning all|pg||
nt|h_karluk: a bit double dummy|pg||
nt|hedyg: hmm ok|pg||
nt|arvidsson: givetvis måste man gissa rätt i @C så ingen garanti att gå hem även om den bjuds|pg||
nt|henryb:  I know; and based on results it is hard to shoose between the two philosophies|pg||
pc|h7|nt|rnmalik: Hello all and welcome.|pg||
nt|lestergold: at this colour north may compete|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North will be reluctant to pass this |pg||
nt|gohar: are u looking for an OT at 4@s?|pg||
nt|Gerben42: apparently not for this pair|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 2 heart is funny in my eyes|pg||
nt|mikael_w: man får nog hemgången i utspelet i 3 nt|pg||
nt|arvidsson: svårt utspel för Johan|pg||
nt|koksoy: 3@H  is  alerted  but  seems  natural invitation|pg||
nt|daman: yes|pg||
nt|mdgraham: EW pretty natural, strong NT. NS Strong Club with control responses, strong NT|pg||
nt|sga1: W in OR found another bid on same hand 1NT.|pg||
nt|daman: 1NT would have been on my radar 30 years ago|pg||
nt|sga1: I agree.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|Walddk1: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/Events/ebl/2010ostend/default.asp  for convention cards and other useful information|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not sure, E has shown values|pg||
nt|marlowepi: with his minors the other way round hewould probably compete|pg||
nt|jallerton: 3@d looks to be a safer partial than 3@s|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Surprise...|pg||
nt|hedyg: there it is|pg||
nt|gohar: :)yes|pg||
nt|arvidsson: om man gissar så  har S visad en svag 2:a I @S med minimum intervall|pg||
nt|rnmalik: good pass by S, no extra values.|pg||
nt|koksoy: spec  says ; its a  conventition  ....  its inv hand  with 6 + 1h and 3 @S|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|xenya: i still think the score in board 1 is wrong|pg||
nt|shevek: we don't have a score in bd 1|pg||
nt|shevek: you mean bd 2 Vlad?|pg||
nt|xenya: 2 i meant|pg||
nt|haans: agree hard to take 8|pg||
nt|dimi: true Jan, strange most pairs have greements to show 4 card support after txf|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|haans: or more than 8|pg||
nt|ady: west has to legislate for a possible bust with east|pg||
nt|lestergold: nice tame contract for eng|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this seems best startr for defense|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I guess the thing about passing, attractive though it may be, is that there is the possibility of being frozen out of the auction |pg||
pc|cK|nt|rnmalik: Good Morning Mike.|pg||
nt|copeyj: depends what pass over 1@S showed|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hearts 3-3, d QJ falls and @cK hook works, cheez n crackers :)|pg||
nt|haans: relays when one ask one responed and asker end up playing 3nt (with his hand) that can be tricy for defense|pg||
nt|haans: been there done it :)|pg||
nt|pitiful:  south did not feel obliged to cue bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: and Bosiger went -1......|pg||
nt|arvidsson: vilket talar för trumf eller hj ut (A sitter troligen hos N) |pg||
pc|c4|nt|copeyj: might be that it showed some values|pg||
nt|benjy:  but how to get there?|pg||
nt|jallerton: though the 4-1 @d break gives both trouble|pg||
nt|andreasw:  other table @c K wad the lead and a @h switch|pg||
pc|c5|nt|lestergold: towsend cannot afford to float this dim|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2H should come in anyway|pg||
nt|lestergold: should be suspicious of the switch|pg||
nt|lestergold: wont comem in if he ducks dim|pg||
nt|copeyj: Askgaard defended very quickly here - Townsend may have picked up on that which may help him to work out what is going on|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he can count five losers if he rises and trumps are ok. but he has to worry about a promoted heart ten|pg||
nt|lestergold: he has safe 8 tricks nowm if he takes the dim|pg||
nt|daman: 3 @D on that collection is very perilous  and he bought a great dummy    if I did that I would go for 800|pg||
nt|sga1: same for me as well :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: only 800? You must buy good dummies|pg||
nt|henryb:  Perhaps only 500. Imperfect defense and great declarer play :)|pg||
nt|daman: I wish|pg||
nt|henryb:  Actually, with the @h raise there is some reasonable chance of buying some trumps in dummy|pg||
nt|sga1: right as max 1@h so good chances r there.|pg||
nt|daman: my dummy would be xxxx x xx xxxxxx   red|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yup|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|mdgraham: EW Precision, 1NT=12-15 1st and 2nd, 15-17 3rd and 4th|pg||
nt|ady: what dowes one show with a bust?|pg||
pc|sK|nt|mamos: South knows that for Slam to be good she need a lot of cards from North|pg||
nt|eweber: the NS pair in the other room also plays "variable" as I just see, 14-16 in 1/2 nv and else 15-17 |pg||
nt|andreasw:  was*|pg||
nt|hawe45:  The bidding: 1 @C pas 1 @S pass - 4 @S...|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Better than asking about this bidding, buy the book...!|pg||
pc|sA|nt|marlowepi: we know he has 8, but he does not|pg||
nt|haans: england can take it|pg||
nt|jallerton: they got there in the other room when W doubled 2@c|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mdgraham: 2@D=weak two in a major, 2@H/@S=two-suited|pg||
nt|haans: imagnative leads not succeeding are not popular|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello Henry Bethe, welcome.|pg||
pc|s2|pg||

nt|pitiful:  well swap south's minors and slam is ok|pg||
nt|mamos: just the trump Q to cause anxiety if EW cah clubs|pg||
nt|hedyg: i dont see how that beats 4@s|pg||
nt|gohar: cant|pg||
nt|hedyg: lose 2@cs and 1@D|pg||
nt|gohar: yes simple and straight|pg||
nt|arvidsson: någon som hade tänkt annorlunda (jag är fruktasnvärt dålig på otur, så försöker få lite tips)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No good lead for West|pg||
nt|affe82: not that I get the bidding but ending in the denomination and level that was expected.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @S bid encouraged N to bid 3@H.|pg||
nt|koksoy: he needs to guess hearts to  make...  he  must give only 2 heart tricks to defence|pg||
pc|hT|nt|marlowepi: nevertheless i agree he should rise|pg||
nt|lestergold: well he can count a likely 4 hearts dim spade club and club ruff surely|pg||
nt|mamos: cash|pg||
nt|pitiful:  well done by east|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Well-done - the worse lead possible ( J x x x ) was good this time|pg||
nt|affe82: my regular pd has forbidden me to ever lead that. so would have had a hard timing replicating W's good lead here.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @C Queen - and @D to the Queen|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Your regular partner is RIGHT!|pg||
pc|d2|nt|xenya: i'm certain the score should be 4-0 Denmark|pg||
nt|andreasw:  how will u only loose 1@D?|pg||
nt|affe82: blir 11 här|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|copeyj: might be double showing a bust|pg||
nt|eweber: no big surprise that they lead a club if 4@s and 5@d were cuebids|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|hermandw: thierry, herman hier, ik probeer even of ik met jullie kan chatten - geef even een klein antwoord|pg||
nt|copeyj: opposite strong @C|pg||
nt|gohar: irrespective of any lead|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I really hope, someting is going on - no declarer should use that time on an ordinary game contract|pg||
pc|c2|nt|marlowepi: theh problem, as i said above, is the possibility of a sixth defensive trick via promotion of heart ten|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No @D-loser|pg||
pc|s6|nt|xenya: can make by overtaking and playing 4 rounds of spades|pg||
nt|h_karluk: honestly dubinin dictated fine|pg||
nt|ady: ok|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|haans: EW cannot take many clubs|pg||
pc|s8|nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Anders Kristensen|pg||
nt|andersk: Hi|pg||
nt|copeyj: I don't know - but I can't believe E passed facing a strong @C unless it showed something|pg||
nt|andreasw:  2@d looser's?|pg||
nt|hedyg: i give 1 and i ruff 1|pg||
nt|andreasw:  W will over ruff|pg||
nt|hawe45:  NO @D-loser|pg||
nt|hedyg: oh true|pg||
nt|affe82: no it seems strange..|pg||
pc|s7|nt|gohar: yes straight hand|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Duck this and finish cross-ruffing for 10 tricks|pg||
nt|affe82: a kibber suggest dropping @s J under A. might give decl a chance to go wrong. at least if on a later board he should get to do the same thing on JTx. kind of interesting play ...|pg||
nt|affe82: really.|pg||
nt|affe82: hans line is better. the drop will prob not happen.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Anyway - no line within some minutes|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Should - in my plan - the third @C be ruffed, you must try the finesse of the @D Jack|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|daman: this is going to work out so well for West|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|h6|nt|Walddk5: Operator, there is a typo in North's name.  EKREN|pg||
nt|andersk: Im not sure what vent wrong here. I like playing 3 @C over 1x-1y-2NT as search for info. Ekrens 4 NT I disagree with, 4333 and actually nothing good exsept for AK A|pg||
nt|hawe45:  To drop the @S Jack is a greek gift |pg||
nt|koksoy: now  he is  safe|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|d3|nt|Walddk5: Reverse the  R and K|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|rmb1: X=0-4, Pass=5-7 after 1C-(1x)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that makes sense, ty|pg||
nt|haans: a make|pg||
nt|jallerton: As Ben points out, if  you X what if it goes 3C 3H to you?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: E gets trump promotion in with @HA and @C return.|pg||
pc|sT|nt|henryb:  and on a @h lead you would take @hA, two @h ruffs, 2@s, and 3@d for 1 down|pg||
pc|d7|nt|daman: definitely a Matchpoint top|pg||
pc|d9|nt|xenya: however that was far from clear|pg||
nt|pitiful:  this sort of hand, it is usually a good idea for north to be able to show shortage below game level|pg||
nt|affe82: this is taking forever. cannot really see why. was surprised earlier when russia-netherlands managed to incur 5VPs penalties eeach fro slow play. they are off to a good start ...|pg||
nt|affe82: repeating that here perhaps..|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This is a joke - restricted choice by West - come on|pg||
nt|affe82: the drop really does not put decl to more of a test. playing them small up achieves the same thing really.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  What decl is thiunking about now, he should have decided before touching the @S|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|andersk: 3 down|pg||
nt|rnmalik: ensured 7 tricks.|pg||
pc|h9|pc|dJ|nt|pitiful:  the degree of fit opposite shortage is often the key|pg||
pc|d6|nt|haans: nope|pg||
nt|mdgraham: good advertisement for an initial 2@D overcall - you get your hand off your chest and can pass with a clear conscience afterwards |pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|daman: and if they continue to bid @Hs    well that is your second suit|pg||

pc|sK|pc|s3|nt|april7: but with the 4-4 fit one  should be in @H|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|nyg8:  3n make by W on club lead. W cashes 4H, 2S and exits a club to N who is endplayed|pg||
nt|marcsmith: not with 4333 opposite 4432 |pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pc|h3|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|marcsmith: true|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h4|pc|h5|pc|hT|pg||
nt|marcsmith: only if South plays the CJ at trick 1 tho|pg||
nt|marcsmith: if South can win the 2nd or 3rd club they can still beat it|pg||
nt|nyg8:  no difference as h plays the T from dummy |pg||
nt|marcsmith: :)|pg||
nt|nyg8:  if S ducks, then W exits with cQ|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h8|pc|h6|pc|s4|pg||
nt|marcsmith: yes and must then lead second round of clubs from dummy|pg||
nt|april7: if you open 1NT with W than stayman leads you also to 4@H for sure|pg||
pc|c5|nt|marcsmith: stayman not obvious on that East hand tho|pg||
nt|nyg8:  not needed, W plays cT at trick 1 from dummy. if S does not cover with J then W exits cQ at end|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|pc|c2|pg||
pc|sT|nt|april7: with doubleton @C?I dout it that he won't use stayman|pg||
nt|marcsmith: he has to lead the second club from dummy, but yesm, you are right|pg||
nt|marcsmith: well, if he uses stayman they he won;t get to 3N |pg||
pc|sA|pc|s8|pc|s2|pg||
nt|april7: would you rather bid 2NT?|pg||
nt|marcsmith: of perhaps he will anyway -- see closed room|pg||
nt|marcsmith: i'd bid 3N|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sJ|pc|s5|nt|drorp: 1st big swing of the match then|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|nyg8:  if E bids 3N I gues S would lead  a S|pg||
nt|marcsmith: looks that way|pg||
nt|april7: in CR E risked to stay in 3@H!|pg||
nt|marcsmith: yes, need West to open 1N so that North is on lead to give you a chance|pg||
pc|d6|nt|drorp: opposite 15-17 NT, E invited...|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|nt|marcsmith: and West accepted, so perhaps it is 13-15 or 14-16...?|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|drorp: he has 17|pg||
nt|marcsmith: so he does -- doesn't look like 17 does it :)|pg||
nt|april7: swing for Israel here on an endplay in CR in 3NT good and lucky judgement by W|pg||
nt|marcsmith: not a difficult option for West tho|pg||
nt|drorp: W suggested to play 3NT, E made the good judgement passing it|pg||

nt|vbman: ---------------4-------------------|pg||
nt|rnmalik: again a tricky hand NS with combined 25 hcp may end up in 3NT.|pg||
nt|vbman: in my cristal l see several down in 3 nt|pg||
nt|copeyj: there you go|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so far we have a tied match|pg||

nt|benjy:  you are completely scuppered|pg||
nt|mamos: Anyway passed of safely|pg||
nt|hedyg: he played K@H on the switch!|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @S A-K useless|pg||
nt|arvidsson: dålig på utspel :) men har ofta otur när jag tänker|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Lucky 12 tricks in a @S-contract hre|pg||
nt|affe82: 6@s seems to be on. can we get a good board for Ger here?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: K@H was played to pin the Q.|pg||
mb|1N|nt|copeyj: slightly fortunate flat board for Russia - 3NT is where you would want to play I should think|pg||
nt|andreasw:  grand slam look's fair|pg||
nt|hedyg: why useless? good for 7NT?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But South leads the @D Q...|pg||
nt|affe82: dags att tänka in ytterligare en 3nt:are|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No, they will play 4 @S - just like in bridge|pg||
nt|mdgraham: which shows in a way that the requirement for a six-card suit to overcall at the two-level is a bit stringent|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: Blaksets 2@H did cost (was that bridge?)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that may be a push against 110|pg||
nt|henryb:  it is a poor contract at beat|pg||
nt|eweber: Sally Brock opened a 14-16 NT with the South hand|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|h_karluk: easy 4@s for EW players|pg||
nt|mdgraham: two poorish results for the Englsih NS next door - 18-0 Denmark|pg||
nt|copeyj: guess this is what a 5@D overcall looks like|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, how do you bid that South hand?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3S|pg||
nt|copeyj: i dont like 3@S|pg||
nt|rnmalik: action hand:)|pg||
nt|haans: trash dim|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: easy 4 h here|pg||
nt|affe82: :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  After this critisable 2 @H-bid, itÂ´s a good slam|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 1@C 16+|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: If played by S has a good chance, but N playing it would be disaster on @S lead.|pg||
nt|copeyj: with a stiff @C|pg||
mb|2H|nt|andersk: Norway EW in open room playing 4@H|pg||
nt|haans: why not 2@C i say|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 5@C wins.|pg||
nt|haans: Nyström far behind|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 1@D=?|pg||
nt|benjy:  1@D shows 4+@H|pg||
nt|affe82: still earns them another imp I guess. altman's choice of 3n was a surprise to me.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Sorry, you can NOT ruff a @H - 4 @S is the spot|pg||
nt|koksoy: they  will  reach  4@H  I  suppose|pg||
mb|p|nt|andersk: probably -1|pg||
nt|andreasw:  now 4@s|pg||
nt|andreasw:  then 7 is on the table|pg||
mb|3H|nt|rmb1: 1NT = 8+ bal|pg||
nt|ady: 6@S a possibility    not a bgreat contract|pg||
nt|h_karluk: well it all depends @s guess|pg||
nt|copeyj: Askgaard and I should have a game some time|pg||
nt|haans: dont ask i wont tell|pg||
nt|haans: bridge or POKER|pg||
nt|Walddk7: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/Events/ebl/2010ostend/default.asp  for convention cards and other useful information|pg||
nt|rnmalik: I have been told by a friend, 11-13, 4M+m|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@c rkc|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Now they bid slam|pg||
nt|affe82: so you don't see him go for the doublefinesse then? lol. no imps. you are right. 11.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: EW play a 3NT opening as a solid 7-card minor, no outside ace or king - so the West hand is too strong for that|pg||
nt|shevek: well, let's just say the board didn't favour their system :)|pg||
nt|haans: :) lets say that|pg||
nt|copeyj: careful defence leads to down 1|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you cant have everything. you get old waiting for the perfect hand. of course at simon's age we all believe that will never happen:)|pg||
nt|mamos: Board 2 was flat NS collected 150 for getting nine tricks in NT the other way :)|pg||
nt|pitiful:  sort of hand t=you might well upgrade|pg||
nt|eweber: 3@d is a Bergen raise here|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Ah - I see, N/S play Rusinow - North leads the @D Jack...|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: easy dia lead, quick claim|pg||
mb|3N|nt|xenya: it certainly did -- did they fell victim to their own system? Or just to an improper use of it?|pg||
nt|andersk: this will be 9 tricks|pg||
nt|haans: you an opening bid when you have no better|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Sensible to play a jump overcall as intermediate at these colours|pg||
nt|pitiful:  west did too much here imo|pg||
nt|eweber: she probably didn't love to do this with a 4333 distribution, many players treat this like a 3 card trump support|pg||
nt|hedyg: 03 14|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: the 3 is positive|pg||
nt|arvidsson: en så kallad kaffebricka |pg||
nt|daman: they will get to 4@H   and making it is not chopped liver    will probably go one off|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: accurate defence beats this as no entry to take heart finegle|pg||
nt|Walddk7: With a nice club fit Paulissen had a fair shot at 3NT|pg||
nt|henryb:  well yes, but would you do any worse bidding 2@c and raising partner's 2N to 3?|pg||
nt|Walddk7: No|pg||
nt|rnmalik: appears to be a doomed contract.|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Paulissen searching for his 9th trick|pg||
nt|henryb:  Purka seems to have found an effective lead|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Indeed he has; 4th best from your longest and strongest would not have worked this time|pg||
nt|jallerton: still 3@s seems to have made more tricks that 3@D in practice|pg||
nt|pitiful:  although 3@d is no thing of beauty|pg||
nt|Gerben42: notice that Jonsson did not bid after 1@D, almost making it impossible for Smirnov Piekarek to go plus (even 5@D will be hard to make without information)|pg||
nt|koksoy: &  there is a  club  ruff for  the  defence...  |pg||
nt|rnmalik: I have been informed that 1@C is natural or 15-19 balanced hand.|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: counting 10 :)|pg||
nt|copeyj: its not waiting for the perfect hand - it is the fact that I think the S hand is described pretty nicely by 5@D|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well no argument there. its just that the beautifully descriptve bid might get you past your only game|pg||
nt|lestergold: the 13 imp swing was due to the hand in which the danes overcalled 4@s here nhand 2 in thne open a more conservative 3s and north bid 3n whioch was very unfortunate form england|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if you bid 3S you can still get to 5D|pg||
nt|copeyj: wasnt that unfortunate mike - 3n was not where you want to play the hands|pg||
nt|copeyj: but i agree that neither action taken next door was unreasonable|pg||
nt|lestergold: on hand 2 Sanduist not unreasonably wanted to protect his K@h so bid 3n rathe rthan raise the spades but unfortunately they had rien in clubs|pg||
nt|mdgraham: indeed. Very disciplined of South to pass 3N. Good lead from East too.|pg||
nt|lestergold: no that was very unlucky i would not criticvise sandqvist at all for his action|pg||
nt|rnmalik: only makes on @D lead or misdefense.|pg||
nt|haans: we fram sweden say "not fair"|pg||
nt|jallerton: 1@c is not systemic - as I understand their system 1@c is only short if 18-20 bal|pg||
nt|hawe45:  South denied the @H-control - 650|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West has a maximum NT and will surely go on|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: but it could be regarded as too lop-sided for a strong club. Still, that is West's choice|pg||
nt|rnmalik: They are in the best contraact possible.|pg||
nt|haans: from|pg||
nt|haans: clubs or 18-20 bal|pg||
nt|jallerton: Systemically West had a choice between 1@s and 1@d|pg||
nt|arvidsson: inga konstigheter är övertricken vi spelar om här|pg||
nt|mikael_w: en typisk bricka som visar tydligt hur viktigt det är med anpassning|pg||
pc|c4|nt|rnmalik: contract.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: web site: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/10Ostend/Ostend.htm|pg||
nt|ady: apart from the possible club loser    which will have to be discarded on the diamonds|pg||
nt|h_karluk: you win if you play ten, you lose if you play K :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I hat to tell you, but 7 @S is ONLY 2.000 = gaining 5 IMP|pg||
nt|hedyg: 7@s?|pg||
nt|affe82: troliga 11. claim inom 4 stick?|pg||
nt|daman: 3NT will have the same fate|pg||
nt|henryb:  Personally, I would rather pass, and balance with double after 2@h-P-P intending to convert 3@c to 3@d|pg||
nt|sga1: After @c no 9th trick|pg||
nt|daman: yes    that would show the hand in a better light     doubling and bidding 3@D?   I would have a much different layout|pg||
nt|henryb:  really? can't North be stripped and endplayed?|pg||
nt|daman: and at least a 6 bagger|pg||
nt|mdgraham: hmm double dummy....win @CQ, 4x@H and 2x@S exit club...|pg||
pc|c3|nt|copeyj: and the two aces|pg||
nt|copeyj: you are missing|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|lestergold: but 13 imps is 13 imps away|pg||
nt|haans: landed right so ...|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|hedyg: oy|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Doubled -|pg||
nt|andreasw:  dosent matter now:(|pg||
nt|hawe45:   I think|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|shevek: likely improper use|pg||
nt|haans: we must tell them whats suits are :)|pg||
nt|mamos: and East in mine if 3@D shows a limit raise|pg||
nt|andreasw:  i think he should have bid 4@s|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Hade N haft omvänt i rödfärgerna hade han bjudit vidare efter S 2@d och då hade man också gjort slam|pg||
pc|h2|nt|h_karluk: we will see how declarer would tackle trumps|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lestergold: its a cruel game|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, it sure ain't 13 imps in|pg||
nt|arvidsson: nej när spadern sitter snett ;) tror jag inte på claim :)|pg||
nt|mikael_w: efter att man kollat så man har alla A förstås|pg||
nt|arvidsson: 11 med rätt giss i ruter, så kan bli en lång resa till 11 stick|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|h_karluk: nice guess|pg||
nt|ady: yes    2 aces missing     sorry|pg||
nt|lestergold: well it is... for the danes....|pg||
nt|mdgraham: now the defenders need to be careful|pg||
nt|copeyj: well defended by gold here - looks like england will prevail on this board after this start|pg||
nt|lestergold: as it happens the 3s would have worked nicely here but with 9 card suit and i did it pard would be void and idn watch 9 tricks go into the skip|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the next few tricks may take awhile|pg||
nt|lestergold: one of those hands in which partnership informatuion exchange is crucial   ....   and concentration....|pg||
nt|copeyj: England in 3N here next door I am told|pg||
nt|lestergold: well eng need a few back so they had better defend carefully here|pg||
nt|copeyj: which will stop the rot if G&T manage to defeat 5@D here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: without breathing a word of criticism about Tosh's 3S call, the outcome exhibits a cautionary point about preempts. sometimes they preempt us instead of the opponents, and of ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: course we cant always tell when we pick up a hand which side will be victimized. BUT -- once opps have already announced the other major, a preempt has somewhat less to gain|pg||
nt|andreasw:  i dont know theyre system but must be void?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Tuff start at this table|pg||
nt|hedyg: after A@H he can claim|pg||
pc|hA|nt|h_karluk: +2?|pg||
nt|affe82: men när han kommer att spela @d sa gör han det till J och 11|pg||
nt|koksoy:  one more chance..  yess|pg||
pc|h4|nt|copeyj: Townsend showing good technique here - he is thinking about all the discards he is going to have to make before making the first one|pg||
nt|lestergold: gold has to discard clubs to show towsend that he only needs to keep ace|pg||
nt|lestergold: think they should / will get this right|pg||
nt|marlowepi: we dont get much practice planning discards against 9-card suits|pg||
nt|lestergold: no point in keeping hearts just needs a spade to get off lead with when club is played|pg||
nt|arvidsson: om inte Cullin vänder i ruter (sista chansen till bet)|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|haans: 2nd opinion: nullve: Fantoni-Nunes ville vel også ha åpnet med 2@h der, så da er det vel bridge... ME: they play 2!"H show a mini opening|pg||
nt|eweber: 3@d showed a 4card mixed raise according to their CC|pg||
nt|hedyg: no has to check @ds first|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes:)|pg||
pc|h9|pc|h8|nt|koksoy: but now there is  no  @S looser|pg||
pc|h6|nt|Walddk7: Drijver led a diamond at the other table, declarer's 9th trick was established|pg||
nt|sga1: That is a possible line definitely.|pg||
nt|daman: is the strip endplay a better proposition than the simple finesse?|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|lestergold: Gold has helped hism pard immediately clarifying the club position|pg||
nt|mdgraham: probably not|pg||
pc|h7|nt|marlowepi: this may be tense but shouldnt be too hard|pg||
pc|d7|pc|hK|nt|marlowepi: true, but there uis no way W would ever duck regardless|pg||
nt|pitiful:  well for me east does not have a 3@d bid but it is much closer than the 4@s bid|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|rnmalik: -1|pg||
nt|mamos: WEll is going somewhere about three off so someone seems to have done tooo much|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  W may well be afraid of game bid next door|pg||
nt|daman: South is helping declarer a bit by sluffing @Ds    he might work out the strip now|pg||
nt|mdgraham: still, he has to decide|pg||
nt|henryb:  Assuming North's shape can be worked out from South's discards, and that the @dK is off because of South's two disdards, yes|pg||
nt|daman: great minds think alike Henry|pg||
pc|s6|pc|sJ|nt|lestergold: frankly this is rooutine defence for top class players but in the heat of battle anything can happen|pg||
nt|hawe45:  About 30 IMPÂ´s diff, that @D behave|pg||

pc|c2|nt|copeyj: pls don't say such things until they are racked up Mike - no tempting fate ty|pg||
nt|copeyj: :)|pg||
nt|copeyj: and good discarding from both of them|pg||

mb|5H|nt|marcsmith: I agree with the 4S opening|pg||

nt|h_karluk: whatever, new board new chances|pg||
nt|ady: this is a possible slam|pg||
nt|vugraphzns: +1|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ok ty gl there|pg||
nt|hedyg: seen much better Andi|pg||
nt|koksoy: contract  was safe to  any  lead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: depressing for NS vulnerable too bootr|pg||
nt|sga1: NS may bid upto 4@s|pg||
mb|4S|nt|copeyj: 12 tricks in NT on non @D lead - and on a @D lead you will have to guess whether to play T or Q if played by South (solid played by N)|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: what happened is beyond me:) |pg||
nt|copeyj: no dressing down whatsoever - that's why he is playing and I am not :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: u arent playing because ur needed as a coach|pg||
nt|andreasw:  i never have:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: yesterday in open Italy was ahead by 48:0|pg||
nt|andreasw:  after how many board's?|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 1@D precision style|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: east west may play 3 spades, will they get a chance to enter bidding?|pg||
nt|arvidsson: balanserar man på V?|pg||
nt|affe82: pass?|pg||
mb|p|nt|shevek: Ron and Blakset play Xfer openings (1@d = @h, 1@h = @ss)|pg||
nt|paulg:  could he not have just thrown dummy in?|pg||
nt|eweber: für die deutschen Zuschauer, die nicht gut englisch sprechen: Fragen Sie mich bitte, wenn Sie etwas nicht verstehen!|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4|pg||
nt|affe82: nej|pg||
mb|p|nt|shevek: 4-cards|pg||
nt|shevek: always unbalanced|pg||
nt|haans: make it harder to find @D|pg||
nt|copeyj: this might have been a good board for england in the closed room|pg||
nt|copeyj: N opened 2@S (8-11)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: ok stout lads, the floor is in good hand, i must away. catch up with you all later:)|pg||
nt|copeyj: but the vulnerability persuaded tosh to try game|pg||
nt|lestergold: stout lads who is Marshall talking about cant be us Simon|pg||
nt|Walddk7: http://tinyurl.com/ebc-open-b   http://tinyurl.com/ebc-open-a   http://tinyurl.com/3yl8spu  for running Euro scores |pg||
nt|andreasw:  wow!|pg||
nt|Gerben42: Elinescu may consider passing, facing a weak NT|pg||
nt|Gerben42: ah he did|pg||
nt|arvidsson: ja det var självklart :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 5@D a good playable contract, the question is to bid it.|pg||
nt|koksoy: weak nt... &  double  is  penalty tendency  ..|pg||
nt|henryb:  And East would have to lead a @d to beat it|pg||
pc|cK|nt|henryb:  given the result at the other table it cost only 1 imp to bid the game as opposed to stoppint liw|pg||
nt|mikael_w: återigen, en självklar balansering i partävling, i lagtävling är det nog mer en stilfråga|pg||
nt|sga1: Hmmm|pg||
pc|cA|nt|shevek: sry, misread the card|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 5@D a reasonable spot for NS. 3NT also on with 4@S losers.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: meant in sense of "stalwart"|pg||
nt|marlowepi: worthy|pg||
nt|copeyj: 2@C art gf i think for these guys - so Townsend doubling for @C lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: back pedalling Marshall eh?!|pg||
nt|mamos: three off turned out  to be optimistic|pg||
nt|pitiful:  e-w may well end up in 3@d|pg||
nt|eweber: Cristina Giampietro and Pony Nehmert bid 1@s 2@s in the other room|pg||
nt|hedyg: and Roland said that is not a record|pg||
nt|affe82: another push. me I prefer 2@s forcing from Kirmse's hand. no trouble getting to the right spot here though.|pg||
pc|c9|nt|janhamhurg: not a good idea i thk, why not 2 dia or 1 no- because they are vulnerable|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|copeyj: 1@H = 4+, 2@C = F1, not FG|pg||
nt|haans: 2 hearts loser = no game|pg||
nt|rnmalik: and so will EW in 4@H.|pg||
nt|haans: 4@S have a chans|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 4@H also makes?|pg||
nt|haans: think no game makes|pg||
nt|jallerton: 1NT natural with 4+ @d I believe|pg||
nt|hawe45:  They probably play the 2 @s-bid for a weaker hand|pg||
nt|affe82: oops. yet again I am lost.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Dangerous now - North must have promised a strong NT|pg||
nt|hawe45:  See it fra South, North shall cover 4 out of 5 losers|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Whatever 4 NT is - North must answer|pg||
nt|koksoy: diamonds 2-2  and heart honours friendly seperated  makes 11  tricks in diamond contract..  but  3@D is  enough for  NS|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@S as an opener seems terribly direct |pg||
pc|h3|nt|arvidsson: men med NS i zonen är nog pass rätt i längden även i partävling|pg||
pc|h9|nt|shevek: so 1@d is 4+@d, always unbalanced|pg||
nt|affe82: i am informed N has showed 14+ bal, might 4n have been quantitative?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|andreasw:  Italy'en team is *powning*:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: this should be -1|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Gave the contract...|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|haans: partscores are not IMPs|pg||
nt|lestergold: bid up boys oh sorry im not allowed bias i withdraw that|pg||
nt|mamos: id expect South to bid 2@h|pg||
nt|mikael_w: tycker du det ? det tycker nog inte jag|pg||
nt|affe82: 630 prob. or am I to be surprised again?|pg||
nt|koksoy: wow..  we  forgot agressive E  :)|pg||
nt|sga1: Now as contract makes N may feel it was right bid.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but leads to a terribly direct 620|pg||
pc|c8|nt|shevek: I used to say that...but...|pg||
nt|copeyj: wow|pg||
nt|rnmalik: shall see, 2@H+1@S=3.|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|dimi: this will be to much|pg||
nt|dimi: -1 likely outcome|pg||
nt|Gerben42: Magnusson meant 2@S as purely comp.|pg||
pc|c3|nt|shevek: lost a few tight finals :)|pg||
nt|haans: Fredit leads magain|pg||
nt|haans: Fredin|pg||
nt|shevek: agree, not a standard lead :)|pg||
nt|xenya: the layout is quite friendly |pg||
nt|ady: got 12 easy tricks without a diamond lead|pg||
nt|copeyj: 2@S fourth suit, 3N showed non minimum, and 6N was music to my biased ears|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Townsend there, buckle up please (personally m confused why didn't search controls)|pg||
nt|ady: as cards are  better played by North who has not losing choise on a diamond lead|pg||
nt|copeyj: maybe 2@C was not gf - let me find their card|pg||
nt|mdgraham: It doesn't look as though 2@C is FG|pg||
nt|lestergold: well they have just cdemnonstrated that it isnt|pg||
nt|lestergold: this is prob only 1 0ff so another 3 likely to Denmark|pg||
nt|copeyj: 1M - 2@C = @D Sign-offOR any INV w/o fit, w/o 5+OM.|pg||
nt|copeyj: according to their card|pg||
nt|lestergold: actually it may make|pg||
nt|copeyj: and apparently 2@D showed @D support |pg||
nt|pitiful:  and east 3@d|pg||
nt|hedyg: with the right defense...|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: now they play 4- probably - 1, but makes if you find the club queen|pg||
nt|Gerben42: but Haraldsson expected perhaps a tiny bit more than this junkyard|pg||
pc|c5|nt|copeyj: i think Townsend will need to underlead his @C to get partner in to lead @H through |pg||
nt|lestergold: and if it makes that s a heftier 8 imps in for the danes|pg||
nt|copeyj: although bjarnarson can play A@D then AKQ@S pitching a @C|pg||
nt|lestergold: on this lead townsend has to find an underlead to put goldin for heart thru to beat this|pg||
nt|copeyj: declarer can always make now mike|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes decline finesse and play on spades so another 8 away no doubt|pg||
nt|haans: kibs believe in 4@H easy make |pg||
nt|paulg:  Townsend-Gold have clearly changed the system from their published convention card, which says that 1NT is game forcing with diamonds|pg||
nt|mamos: :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Lead a small @H - and South will play for the @C-finesse|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|haans: i have played @CJ here|pg||
nt|shevek: lol|pg||
nt|shevek: they played together b4|pg||
nt|haans: true|pg||
nt|shevek: never underlead a queen?  :)|pg||
nt|xenya: seems 11 tricks can be made|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mamos: well predicted Peter |pg||
nt|janhamhurg: spade now|pg||
nt|arvidsson: jag tycker att det är ett svårt läge, men zonerna hade hjort att jag passat i båda fallen|pg||
nt|koksoy: down2  ??|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|rnmalik: Play appears to be simple or it looks, A@H and A@D and small @C to A and KQ@C and pitch @H and let E ruff and 1@S loser.|pg||
nt|copeyj: can claim|pg||
nt|copeyj: AKJ@H pitching two @D losers|pg||
nt|copeyj: and give up @S|pg||
nt|affe82: personligen hade jag inte balanserat i ngn form. lite skräpigt.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|h_karluk: 2 times @s hold-up would make it interesting |pg||
nt|lestergold: now brilliancy needed|pg||
nt|jallerton: are they allowed to vary their system, Paul?|pg||
nt|Gerben42: still isnt a hopeless contract |pg||
pc|dK|pg||
pc|dA|nt|pitiful:  looks like 9 tricks|pg||
nt|hedyg: wd|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: now actually its better than 50%|pg||
nt|Gerben42: good guessing in trumps helps|pg||
pc|d5|nt|vbman: rehi|pg||
nt|vbman: this will be challenging|pg||
nt|rnmalik: seems so.|pg||
nt|vbman: cash 2 cl ,play the three spot discarding hearts|pg||
nt|copeyj: the Russians stopped in 3NT next door I am told|pg||
nt|h_karluk: now declarer claims, push next board please|pg||
nt|copeyj: 8@C encouraging|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 10@C now?|pg||
nt|lestergold: does thnat show count or the club q|pg||
nt|copeyj: attitude |pg||
nt|copeyj: no need for count with doubleton on display in dummy|pg||
nt|copeyj: Tom will underlead|pg||
nt|lestergold: well there is chance now kill point as jens Auken would say|pg||
nt|copeyj: I am sure|pg||
nt|hedyg: in OR N did not open and then punished his pd for overcalling|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|janhamhurg: or in clubs- but still i guess -1|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|xenya: so far so good|pg||
nt|copeyj: yes|pg||
nt|affe82: squeeze for 11|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think that was wrong: could lead to defeat even with @d 2-2 if trumps 4-0|pg||
mc|10|nt|lestergold: do u fwel that south was right to run the dim a lead away from q was not too likely|pg||
nt|paulg:  Assuming the change is minor and published to the other countries|pg||
nt|Gerben42: yes|pg||

nt|nyg8:  do you play for Kx in N or 10x in south|pg||
nt|nyg8:  or KTx in N|pg||
nt|marcsmith: 7D or 7N here|pg||
mb|p|nt|marcsmith: probably get it right as North is known to hold the long spades|pg||
nt|drorp: wouldn't be hard to reach|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|mb|2D|mb|p|nt|marcsmith: if North has a strong jum[ shift available, this is the time to use it|pg||
nt|april7: could win 2 imps here|pg||
mb|2H|mb|p|nt|marcsmith: possible|pg||
nt|nyg8:  how do N find out about SK ?|pg||
nt|nyg8:  4N will be asking in H not S|pg||
nt|marcsmith: doesn't need SK|pg||
nt|marcsmith: just 2 aces to cover his two clubs|pg||
mb|4D|nt|nyg8:  true... but frmo a theoretical standpoint|pg||
nt|april7: BW in @S: answer 3 aces|pg||
mb|p|nt|marcsmith: no blackwood if South doesn't Q SA now|pg||
mb|4S|nt|drorp: 4@D= we gonna play in @D, any bid is a cue|pg||
nt|marcsmith: agree|pg||
mb|p|nt|marcsmith: North doesn't know if there are 2 club losers tho|pg||
nt|drorp: 4N-5H-7N seems a good continuation, when partner cues in spade, i'm not afraid of losing 2 club tricks|pg||
nt|marcsmith: what if South has KQx of clubs|pg||
nt|marcsmith: blackwood doesn't help|pg||
nt|marcsmith: he wouldn't bid this way with AKxxx/QJxx/x/KQx?|pg||
mb|5H!|nt|april7: I wonder why 7@D in CR after S showed 2 aces!!!|pg||
mb|p|nt|drorp: with something like AKQxx, Qxxx, x, Qxx he could bid 5@D on 4@D|pg||
nt|marcsmith: or AKQxx/QJxx/x/QJx|pg||
nt|nyg8:  i think N make life complicated, if he bids 4N after 2H it is easy|pg||
nt|marcsmith: now 6C should get job done|pg||
nt|drorp: well N also decided he's not playing anything under slam, so why not asking for aces?|pg||
nt|marcsmith: easier if North can bid 1S-3D to start with of course|pg||
mb|6C|mb|p|nt|april7: like inn CR|pg||
nt|marcsmith: pointless to bid 7D now|pg||
mb|7D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|marcsmith: yes, why on earth would you bid 7D when you find out partner has the two missing aces?|pg||
nt|nyg8:  also  could go down on a H ruff|pg||
nt|drorp: maybe he's still not sure if partner has A@S or not, as cue can be either 1st or 2nd control (6@C had to be 1st, as it's already trying for grand)|pg||
nt|marcsmith: can you not see 13 tricks in NT?|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|marcsmith: in the other room they used Blackwood|pg||

nt|vbman: my line needed 44 h|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Operator please the contract is just made.|pg||
nt|haans: GRAND|pg||
nt|pitiful:  was that really only 9 operator?|pg||
nt|dimi: oops|pg||
nt|Gerben42: revoke?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: a partial.|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: yes, a chance for Sweden here|pg||
nt|haans: not easy|pg||
nt|dimi: 2 revokes?|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: so 12 imps away by a lack of concentration|pg||
nt|vugraphzns: yes|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: no revoke just the ten under the jack|pg||
nt|Gerben42: now its important to realize 15 more boards coming lots of chance|pg||

mb|1S!|nt|rnmalik: what misfits:)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: brb coffee break|pg||
nt|haans: no cc for ew|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Interesting hand.|pg||
nt|vugraphzns: miss click +1 sorry|pg||
nt|haans: 6@D sac optimal|pg||
nt|sga1: absolutely freak hands |pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: I would pass 3@C with the N hand i think|pg||
nt|copeyj: assuming this is weak jump|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 6@D/@H equally good.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: OR result interesting.|pg||
nt|Gerben42: not sure what 2@S shows here|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: ok it was a revoke then, the spade 10 on a club|pg||
nt|arvidsson: en intressant giv vi har framför oss, där man ska nå 5@C|pg||
nt|affe82: som är en off, väl?|pg||
nt|mikael_w: 5 @c hamnar man nog lätt i här. men det går kanske att spela hem också|pg||
nt|arvidsson: klart det går att lira hem|pg||
nt|affe82: kanske kan ns komma för högt i @h? 3@hX -1?|pg||
nt|arvidsson: men sedan är frågan om det är troligt|pg||
nt|mikael_w: varför är det klart att det går hem ?|pg||
nt|arvidsson: inte alls klart, men man kan gå hem|pg||
nt|mikael_w: precis :)|pg||
nt|daman: the grand salami on tap|pg||
mb|3D|nt|haans: one harder to find|pg||
nt|rnmalik: yep|pg||
nt|rnmalik: what is wrong with 6@C, EW.|pg||
nt|benjy:  impossible in my view|pg||
nt|eweber: I have been told these sites work best with Internet Exlorer, some browsers refuse to show anything when you click on "playing record"|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 2@S=8+hcp, 6+@D|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Operator how can the hand be made +4, please correct or let us know how the hand was played?|pg||
nt|shevek: 1@c is either natural, or bal w/o 5M, Xfer responses|pg||
nt|xenya: not exactly an exciting set so far|pg||
nt|copeyj: yet another strong @C from Dubinin|pg||
nt|lestergold: well io ccertainly would not raise spades wioth the south hand if thats what pard bid- obviously forcing by unpassed hand|pg||
nt|haans: spades tempting|pg||
nt|haans: holy ...|pg||
nt|Walddk7: 4@S is down on best defence|pg||
nt|paulg:  Fallenius about to use Leaping Michaels?|pg||
nt|haans: we have as u in england played Multi for 40 years|pg||
nt|mamos: a heavy 1NT in my opinion with 17 and a five card suit|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Väljer man att spela på @d så löser det sig nog, |pg||
nt|affe82: tom -2 i @h.|pg||
nt|affe82: 4-0 gör det svart att hämta hem sticken.|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Nu börjar det dock se jobbigt ut att nå 5 @c då varken Ö eller V har visat @c|pg||
nt|sga1: Cold 7@d can he bid that. Shud be possible.|pg||
nt|daman: strong jump shift|pg||
nt|henryb:  how do you show an 11 winner hand?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: one feels Blackwood coming up....|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|lestergold: i would repeat clubs|pg||
nt|copeyj: Gold-Townsend another chance to shine defensively to hold the loss to 2 imps|pg||
nt|haans: that was POKER|pg||
nt|jallerton: easy for players of this level in an uncontested auction, harder when opponents bid|pg||
nt|haans: asked and answered|pg||
nt|paulg:  I wonder how many pairs have discussed strong follow ups to this 4@d bid?|pg||
nt|jallerton: the trouble with 4@d is that it loses the @C suit.  Having passed on 1st round, I prefer to double 2@s|pg||
nt|hedyg: N needs to find a @D lead to hold this to 10 tricks|pg||
nt|henryb:  7N is better|pg||
nt|sga1: or 7NT|pg||
nt|daman: could some form of exclusion help this one?|pg||
mb|4N|nt|shevek: 2@d is some Fit Showing (nonJump)|pg||
nt|copeyj: i think Dubinin has shown 18-20 balanced|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Heart, ruffed, diamond to the ace, heart ruff, and @SA|pg||
nt|mamos: but wont matter here |pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: Operator: same problem in Board 4|pg||
nt|haans: 2@D must be a raise|pg||
nt|shevek: yes|pg||
nt|vbman: dbl?|pg||
nt|lestergold: but 3@s i agree was optimistic opposite a weak jump at green|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Pushed them to 6, now non-vul 6@D the order of the day:)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: no @H lead-ruff-@D-another @H ruff and @SA.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: sorry late.|pg||
nt|haans: never nice to x with spade void|pg||
nt|mikael_w: OPPERATOR ? are you sure this is right ?|pg||
nt|mikael_w: ser ut som ett väl hårt 1NT inkliv tycker jag :)|pg||
nt|daman: nah    he's unsheathing Easley|pg||
nt|henryb:  hard to do exclusion in partner's opened suit|pg||
nt|sga1: When simple blackwood is the right answer to reach 7N, why try exclusion here.|pg||
nt|sga1: Although exclusion coud have been right also.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I don't think 4@s by North on this auction as ERKCB is in anybody's armoury|pg||
mb|5H!|nt|vbman: well , u r never served if u just stand and wait|pg||
nt|copeyj: so now I am sure Gromov will look for 4-4 @H fit|pg||
nt|pitiful:  yes maybe but AK is not a good 7 points|pg||
nt|hawe45:  And pd did NOT bid 1 @S|pg||
nt|hedyg: in OR S bid 1@d and 4@H was played by E with a Q@D lead|pg||
nt|Gerben42: EW doing what's right against pairs who mix it up like NS - just play their normal game|pg||
mb|p|nt|jallerton: never nice to play 4@h with 7@C cold|pg||
nt|hedyg: wow wd!|pg||
nt|dimi: 11 easy tricks|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: i dont like the 2 spade call- much to strong for me|pg||
mb|7D|nt|haans: true :)|pg||
nt|dimi: i agree Jan|pg||
nt|Gerben42: me too - but NS like to mix it up, it's their style|pg||
nt|dimi: :)|pg||
nt|daman: the @C suit is important for a small slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: and play 4@H|pg||
nt|paulg:  interesting that perhaps both North and South were planning a leaping michaels bid|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes a great lead |pg||
nt|henryb:  asking to lose 2 imps|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: Hi Peter, agree.|pg||
nt|copeyj: looks like 5 card stayman, so 2@D showed 1+ 4cM, 2@S showed @H and no @S|pg||
nt|copeyj: is my guess|pg||
nt|mdgraham: oh wd|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Townsend is defending very well this match|pg||
nt|copeyj: they both are|pg||
nt|haans: will E double|pg||
nt|mamos: it is difficult to describe such hands if you open 1@H|pg||
nt|arvidsson: ja inte var det blygt inte|pg||
nt|koksoy: board 4 was played 3nt in  other room  ...  down...  13 for  Denmark|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @D switch important before losing the control.|pg||
nt|koksoy: defence may get 2heart  and 3 diamonds ..  seems  easy  but...|pg||
nt|rnmalik: who would play @D? |pg||
nt|koksoy: heart  now...  then  N I suppose|pg||
nt|koksoy: somebody  should..|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: Hi Mike and Rashed|pg||

pc|d6|nt|shevek: good choice by north|pg||
nt|xenya: N has a mountain, with his 7-carder and all those primes |pg||
nt|haans: harder to find @D lead now|pg||
nt|rodvenn: Det er mye tekniske feil her nede. så at vi detter ut, er ikek nødvendigvis BBOs feil|pg||
nt|rnmalik: x was -3=800.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: with correct  @S guess 5@C makes for NS.|pg||
nt|haans: 3rd hand opening|pg||
pc|dK|nt|pelu: 11-13 and 17-19 only non vuln|pg||
nt|lestergold: only really needs good begaviour in dims and no disaster elsewhere|pg||

nt|copeyj: 1@S-2@C-2@D-2N-4N all pass|pg||
nt|h_karluk: carbon copy auctions are very rare|pg||
nt|paulg:  I've only played against Fredin a couple of times, but he is one of the more imaginative that I've seen|pg||
nt|arvidsson: bra utspel och en trolig bet att vänta|pg||
nt|arvidsson: kan lätt bli -2 då kommunikationen inte är den bästa (lätt att få till två @H till försvaret) om S lägger i K som exempel|pg||
pc|s8|nt|rnmalik: pass or @H gains, a large swing.|pg||
nt|jallerton: There is a case for double rather than 2@s with East|pg||
nt|mikael_w: det var inte lätt att gå hem ändå, det vimlar inte av ingångar på´S för att spela @h|pg||
pc|s9|nt|copeyj: 2@C was nat FG OR limit raise in @S, 2@D showed 5+@S and the rest was natural|pg||
nt|copeyj: The Russians have stopped safely in 3NT well done |pg||
nt|copeyj: and this is going down if townsend leads one|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but does it ask for that.....|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|copeyj: maybe it didnt|pg||
nt|copeyj: townsend didnt think it did at any rate|pg||
nt|lestergold: if 2@c was natural then it surely did ask for a club|pg||
nt|copeyj: might just say he thinks they have overbid Mike|pg||
nt|pitiful:  i know it's all the rage to open 1NT with the south hand and I understand the problems of the canape strong @c system that n-s play but I am not a fan|pg||
nt|eweber: the easiest way to reach all the runnig scores is via the official website|pg||
pc|h5|nt|jallerton: West I mean|pg||
nt|haans: yes many in sweden believe that including Fredin|pg||
pc|h2|nt|xenya: well on a @D lead it's 5 or 7|pg||
nt|andersk: looks like -1 here|pg||
pc|h9|nt|shevek: that is true|pg||
nt|lestergold: might have thopught that it asked him to lead his suit- this is a well known area of ambiguity ion defence you would have thought they had it sorted|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the natural lead would be a heart one would think....so perhaps double should have the lead directing overtone for clubs  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: difficult|pg||
nt|lestergold: well i expect words will be said later and im not adding any fuel to that fire|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but then, if you think the contract will go down a packet if partner simply leads his suit, it's a bit rough if you can't double because that would ask him to lead something else |pg||
nt|jfaria: even if @d wouldnt behave always 9 tricks via @c |pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|arvidsson: nej nu blev det 2 bet|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Oh-no - West can see, that they have an 8-card fit in @H|pg||
nt|koksoy: operator ..  could  you  please  score board 6 ??|pg||
pc|dT|nt|Gerben42: i went through the play - wasnt that clear to guess it - but he made it :)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: the 4@S bid opposite the vuln preempt showed good judgement|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: and trust!|pg||
nt|Gerben42: unfortunately @CAKQ was opposite the singleton and break 5-2|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: still makes 10 trick ace of dia is well|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Good morning to Bernard Ludewig|pg||
pc|d2|nt|rnmalik: Should guess right with the opening bid.|pg||
nt|jfaria: now easy ten|pg||

pc|d5|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 6@d has a double dummy solution|pg||
nt|copeyj: two imps to Russia here|pg||
nt|arvidsson: spader var enklare att spela, men då det är Belgien som spelför är vi inte lässna för det|pg||

pc|s5|pg||
nt|rodvenn: there is a new record in direct transfes from BBO. But the technical problems may not be because of BBO.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: with one of my regular partners we have the agreement here that double asks partner to lead his suit  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: although I'm not saying that it's best|pg||
nt|lestergold: it is a matter for partnership agreement |pg||
nt|lestergold: best is having an agreement and sticking to it|pg||
nt|copeyj: Slovakia 2 Italy 0|pg||
nt|mdgraham: There is also a question of ethics. You must pass or double in tempo. You can't think for ages and then pass and have partner find the right lead |pg||
nt|lestergold: very true Mike|pg||
nt|mamos: ive been looking at scores instead of bridge :(    sorry|pg||

mb|1N|nt|shevek: no finesse in OR|pg||

nt|copeyj: not the luckiest of layouts here for 4@S|pg||

nt|mamos: but a loser in each suit so only probaly an imp or so|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok to pass in E for me, even in 3rd seat|pg||
nt|hawe45:  It seems, that the swiss South in OR has guessed the @S-position, maybe 2 IMP waiting|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: second excellent board from piekarek-smirnov|pg||
nt|ludewig: they may try 4@S again|pg||
nt|arvidsson: så det hoppas vi inte på :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|copeyj: 2N is roughly 21-22 for Gold/Townsend (1@C opener can include balanced 20)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i choose 2@c big there, m i alone ?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: just borrowed one HCP|pg||

mb|p|nt|andersk: good job by GeO|pg||

nt|Gerben42: with passed pd, another "weak jump overcall", agree with 2@D|pg||

nt|ludewig: 5@D makes after a Club lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzns: player in discussion|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 4@D looks like final contract now|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: no alert i guess|pg||
nt|vugraphzns: yes|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|rnmalik: why not the minor suit transfer, for my education:)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  hopefully W lead's a @s:)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: although it may be "general bridge logic" to bid 3@H only with fit, I still think one should alert it|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: if 3 hearts is a fit jump east might bid 3 spades|pg||
nt|arvidsson: eller det sticket får vi ändå, men snyggare|pg||

nt|mdgraham: boards like that last one swing hundreds of points - NS bid defensively (they cannot have been expecting to make 3@H) to go one down, which appears no disaster - but EW can't make ...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: vert much either   |pg||
nt|lestergold: what is 2@c?|pg||
nt|copeyj: probably their way of showing an invitational hand with 5(6)@S|pg||
nt|haans: then you are in 3nt|pg||
nt|haans: acceptance from W|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  lucky guys - today is a "short" day - 1 or 2 matches only|pg||

pc|d3|nt|pelu: short of entries - better to play @S now|pg||

nt|mikael_w: man vill ju heller inleda @h-behandlingen med liten mot bordet med den starka öppnaren till höger|pg||

nt|arvidsson: om Ö har kort hj vill man det :)|pg||

pc|s4|nt|mamos: Nevena   knows whats she wants to happen|pg||
nt|arvidsson: handlar om vem som har 2 hj|pg||
nt|hawe45:  That is asking for trouble - now North can get rid of a @D|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Best defence = one more @C|pg||
pc|h2|nt|rnmalik: He has 9 tricks on @S guess.|pg||
nt|jallerton: or perhaps the operator mis-saw and he actually opened 2@d on bd 2|pg||
nt|paulg:  yes, that is possible too, it would not have been on the tray for long|pg||

mb|1D!|nt|arvidsson: ännu en bricka med kamp om kontraktet|pg||
mb|d|nt|rnmalik: +2|pg||
nt|pitiful:  i would expect the last board to be a swing to England|pg||

nt|pitiful:  North will open 1N|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 4@S for EW and a possibility for going overboard.|pg||
nt|koksoy: 2@S  is clubs  I  think  a  transferred  3 level  opennings ?? |pg||
mb|r|mb|4H|nt|lestergold: Roland deal here|pg||
nt|lestergold: 20/20 hcp division|pg||

nt|Gerben42: another "Burger King opening" (over 1 zillion served), as Meckstroth describes it|pg||
nt|ludewig: finally a part score hand|pg||
nt|affe82: 4@c ser ut att vara en god sac mot 3@h|pg||
nt|rnmalik: yep|pg||

mb|p|nt|andersk: Iceland playing 4@S X in open room  8|pg||
nt|haans: assume trash|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: most likely, 2@H was down 1|pg||
nt|lestergold: well  could be repeated here double is normal holding two bullets opposite an opener|pg||
nt|jfaria: but doubt they will reach it|pg||
nt|pitiful:  4@h is a good spot here|pg||
nt|eweber: such things happen, but I am amazed that no one realized when it happened in the vugraph!|pg||
nt|hedyg: doesnt want to bid 1NT with xx in @d|pg||
nt|hawe45:  3 NT OK with me here|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes 3nt look's fair enough to bid|pg||
nt|daman: nope|pg||
nt|daman: the same philosophy as his partner    points|pg||
mb|4N|nt|copeyj: although looks like 11 tricks so maybe england got away lightly|pg||

mb|p|nt|h_karluk: i would pass to 2@h|pg||
nt|lestergold: they did |pg||
nt|rnmalik: very, how missed. May be difficult to bid with N hand.|pg||
nt|ludewig: actualy 3 NT is good|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: so a bad result from germany in number 7|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: down 3 in a 3 no contract gives 5 imps to iceland|pg||
nt|Gerben42: I'm surprised that Alex passed that rather than a weak 2|pg||
nt|Gerben42: but I know they have very strict standards for 2-bids|pg||
nt|hawe45:  1 @S is NOT everybodyÂ´s taste, might play a strong @C-system|pg||
nt|koksoy: it  was weak  preempt in  any  suit ý was informed  ..  that  enables W  to make  cue and invite slem|pg||
nt|sga1: How lucky to find partner with 7@hs.|pg||
mb|5C|nt|paulg:  You can get all the convention cards from http://tinyurl.com/3yrfhjq|pg||

mb|d|nt|mdgraham: 1@S=game invitational or better, relay|pg||
nt|lestergold: well i would pass 1 spade|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and i have no idea why did not rebid 2@C|pg||
nt|ady: I think 2@H artificial|pg||
nt|haans: what is leaft of Precision are weak opening bids|pg||
nt|jallerton: trump lead common on this auction as dummy often hits with @c shortness and maybe only 3 trumps|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 3 hearts now- any extras you see in that hand?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: south has followed the not unreasonable thibn king that a freely bid vulnerable game maybe an ace isnt working and he was right|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Board 7, 5@C -1, @S wrong guess.|pg||
nt|jfaria: that's it|pg||
nt|jfaria: fiendly lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: has pros and cons i admit.... passing or bidding|pg||
nt|rmb1: 2@H = transfer|pg||
nt|Gerben42: important to note that Magnusson did not bid 3@H - remember the saying " only monkey climb alone"|pg||
nt|affe82: gar väl hem tom. sa det kanske det kan bli. svart att komma dit nu dock|pg||
mb|p|nt|shevek: not much point in ducking here|pg||

nt|h_karluk: agree Mike, pass to 1@s sound|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Will North lead 4th best @S...?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: maybe 1@S from South might have been better|pg||
pc|hT|nt|rnmalik: makes the work easy.|pg||
nt|andreasw:  nope:)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Ace and @D to the 10|pg||
nt|hedyg: Hans he cannot see the cards|pg||
pc|c3|nt|hawe45:  No - but he needs 9 tricks|pg||
nt|andreasw:  he can try:p|pg||
nt|hedyg: only 26 of them|pg||
nt|arvidsson: kan spelas hem, men inte självklart (4@C) dvs bra bjudet av EW här, men jag var aldrig orolig|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Exciting now|pg||
nt|hawe45:  All depends of the trump-play|pg||
pc|h7|nt|lestergold: west probably backs in if u pass but unlikely they have a game and more likely u get into trouble bidding|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I see no reason for the winning @S-finesse, sorry|pg||
nt|daman: Iwould have bid 1 @S if I was South     you have to include partner in the process|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|shevek: not much point in winning either :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: so why in @D?|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@ds and 1@h is enough|pg||
pc|c8|nt|pelu: 11 toptricks - time for coffee :)|pg||
nt|haans: well done Sweden :)|pg||
nt|eweber: Sally and Nicola have won 12 Imps by pushing Cristina and Pony to 5 in board 6|pg||
pc|c7|nt|hawe45:  Bu what a lucky @D-position|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ady: I tht 2@H  was a tranfer back to 2@S  which may be on a minumum opening   and a 2@S rebid  invitational  |pg||
nt|copeyj: I would not pass 1@S - the opponents could very easily have a vulnerable game on|pg||
nt|h_karluk: well unless 1@s implies 23+ pass quite normal|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|andersk: -1, good result for NS here! As the layout is, 3 NT makes EW|pg||

nt|haans: no guess at or|pg||
nt|Gerben42: looks like down 1|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: spade now?|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: or club?|pg||
nt|sga1: Redbl with @h void was definitely wrong.|pg||
pc|h4|nt|haans: thsi room|pg||
pc|d3|pc|h8|nt|Walddk4: Please tell how 2@H made 9 tricks on board 8|pg||
nt|lestergold: well i agree its controversial but here you have a misfit and the heart suit and a k makes it unlikely not impossible that oppos have a game|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|h_karluk: say they have a game, what can we do pal :)|pg||
nt|copeyj: of course it is unlikely, but the downside of responding is relatively small, where as the upside is big|pg||
nt|ady: anyone know the mweaning of the 2@H rebid?|pg||
pc|d5|nt|jallerton: the English N/S play 5-card Stayman so South had to transfer out to 2@s and play in the worse 2@s contract|pg||
nt|henryb:  perhaps they play that no XX = <10HCP|pg||
pc|dA|nt|Walddk4: Down 1 much more likely|pg||
nt|h_karluk: no sorry|pg||
nt|jallerton: North did well to make it|pg||
nt|andreasw:  :)or 1@d and 2@h|pg||
pc|d9|nt|hawe45:  By taking the @cÂ´s he will get discard-problems himself|pg||

nt|xenya: yes|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: contract starts to look better- but not enough to make|pg||

pc|d2|nt|haans: trash may end you in 4-3 instead of 5-3|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|hawe45:  That was why I recommended to play at least a RED suit from dummy|pg||

nt|haans: small to A one way|pg||
pc|s2|nt|hedyg: ohhhh not @d to the 10?|pg||

nt|marcsmith: North might have led a low spade from the A but not from Q when he won the heart|pg||
nt|april7: there is actually only 1 playin @S!!!|pg||
nt|marcsmith: if South has SA instead of Q, declarer has to play DA, CK club to endplay him|pg||
nt|marcsmith: switch N/S spades|pg||
nt|marcsmith: so actually there is not only one play in spades|pg||
nt|april7: or no @S at all!|pg||
nt|drorp: yep still some reading to do, but percentage is @S to K, after all you don't know that you can strip south's hand from diamonds|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d8|pc|dA|pc|d7|pg||
pc|d2|pc|s9|pc|s7|pc|dJ|pg||
nt|marcsmith: that's effectively the same as playing for SA onside|pg||

nt|april7: small @S now!!!|pg||
nt|drorp: crucial moment coming|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|s5|nt|marcsmith: i predict he'll get it wrong|pg||

mb|1N|nt|haans: garbage is to long word for me|pg||
nt|eweber: but they had an easier task since Cristina had shown her 5card @h suit by jumping to 3@h over the 2@d intervention|pg||
nt|andreasw:  when you are in a contract by missunderstanding's they first thing u have to do after game plan is playing it like u have everything under control|pg||
nt|dimi: maybe first slam|pg||
nt|ludewig: slam for NS |pg||
nt|Gerben42: 1@D alerted because it cant be balanced|pg||
nt|daman: 3NT for EW now|pg||
nt|henryb:  Franz seems to have won 12 imps by his 4@s opener|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: well, it's a bit early for a beer, I suppose  |pg||

mb|3C!|nt|copeyj: England need to start motoring|pg||

nt|copeyj: certain push i would say|pg||
nt|haans: not easy to find the sac here|pg||
nt|haans: E has all his cards in other suits|pg||
nt|Gerben42: if anyone then this pair|pg||
nt|affe82: köps i 3@d?|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodvenn: han må trumfe seg inn på bordet og spilel stående spar. kaste klvøer. Vest må stjele og er innspilt. må spilel kl opp til K kn|pg||

mb|p|nt|lestergold: no heartb lead will make ten tricks inpractice|pg||
nt|eweber: would you prefer 31h?|pg||

nt|rnmalik: logical contract.|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  no, about the right time here:)|pg||
nt|copeyj: West has opened 1N here|pg||

nt|eweber: 3@h?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No - 3 NT was a normal shot|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: i think its hard to make 6 hearts|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: he doesnt like his hand so much|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 5@D down 2|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: now x would be great|pg||
nt|ludewig: and 6 @S should go down after a club lead, so no slam after all|pg||
mb|p|pc|c3|nt|rnmalik: Water best remedy:)|pg||

nt|copeyj: and east has raised to 3|pg||

nt|rnmalik: Specs have pointed out that Sweden has more Vps then I mentioned, may the record available with me has not been updated.:)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Interesting hand very easy to go above board.|pg||
nt|henryb:  Jansma's most successful action would have been the "green" card|pg||
nt|andreasw:  nope |pg||
pc|c7|nt|andyv:  I wonder how they got the 12th trick|pg||
nt|pelu: no beer for me to day - to morrow morning I am going by car to Oostende :(|pg||
nt|copeyj: 2@H showed 6@S minimum or 16+ with @C|pg||
nt|copeyj: when he continued with 3@h|pg||
nt|h_karluk: seems a good beginning is half a succession|pg||
nt|copeyj: he showed 5-3-1-4 and a good hand|pg||
nt|h_karluk: k ty|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm the hackett vulnerable barrage on the ew/ cards in the open room does not look very sound lucky only one off|pg||
nt|mdgraham: nine toppers|pg||
nt|haans: we take that as it comes|pg||
nt|jfaria: 1nt must be like std now|pg||
nt|hedyg: can W find the @s lead?|pg||
pc|c9|nt|paulg:  nice dummy here|pg||
nt|Gerben42: good decision from N although I dont believe pass was forcing from S|pg||
nt|vugraphzns: td|pg||
nt|arvidsson: 9 stick om normal spelföring (maskar i ruter)|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|rnmalik: We have a very generous operator.|pg||
nt|Gerben42: who called? was there a BIT somewhere?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  As almost always: Trump Lead is the best - for the defence|pg||
nt|henryb:  What was 3@c? |pg||
pc|h9|nt|lestergold: i mean neither of their buids would have been my choice|pg||
nt|ady: I suppose has some other way of showing 5-3-4-1 good hand|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  not the classical Multi opening, although this time it worked well|pg||
nt|andreasw:  nope:)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @S-lead|pg||
nt|andreasw:  would be the easy way out|pg||
nt|hedyg: not impossible|pg||
nt|koksoy: we   see  EW  play  nt opening strong or  weak  depends on  vulneribily|pg||
pc|h5|nt|rnmalik: This is cursed lead, every time lead K from KQ find AJ:)|pg||
nt|haans: lot of finesses|pg||
nt|mamos: Yes its worked well  |pg||
nt|hedyg: you surely dont want to lead anything else |pg||
nt|hawe45:  No comments - I promise!|pg||
nt|andreasw:  i like to lead a @c or @s on w hand|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|pg||
nt|copeyj: which hand are you talking about david - 9?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ten when @SQ drops|pg||
nt|hedyg: i like to open with the E hand :(|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: cant have south 2 small dia instead of 2 small hearts?, i think there was hesitation after the 5 dia call|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @S 8 is the correct switch now|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@C is described as NF Stayman, so 3@C may be F Stayman - CC not really clear|pg||
pc|hK|nt|pelu: Andy : problems with the claim almost every time - we have given up :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Their is no alternative toi the @S-lead - after this bidding|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|copeyj: if so then yes he wld have started with 2@C transfer to @D|pg||
pc|h4|nt|hawe45:  Does not matter, sry|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|h3|nt|andyv:  ok:)|pg||
nt|ady: yes|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|pelu: passiv by the swedes - they can make 3@d|pg||
nt|andyv:  with 4 trump S probably would have preferred a forcing game rather than lead a @d but neither black suit is attractive (although @c lead seems to work well)|pg||
nt|jallerton: Yes, 4@s looks aggressive, although perhaps East would not bid 2@s with 3334 playing 4-card majors |pg||
pc|h8|nt|copeyj: Isner has won the marathon Wimbledon match, 70-68 in the final set|pg||
nt|haans: 5 losers|pg||
nt|paulg:  Meckstroth's Rule: bid game when partner raises your six-card major|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: crazy play|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|henryb:  and every time you lead low you find dummy with Jx and Declarer with Axx|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ady: ok     thx|pg||
nt|h_karluk: preempts are double edge swords and twins are supposed to get experienced abt that issue, but who knows there were a tough table pressure|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true.|pg||
nt|Gerben42: with screens it is necessary that the side calls TD that was opposite the BIT|pg||

pc|d3|pg||

nt|Gerben42: and TD = tournament director |pg||

nt|marcsmith: not really -- with a heart to lose you don't want to play 6S with those trumps|pg||
nt|drorp: also they have to find the @H lead, otherwise it will make almost always|pg||

pc|d7|nt|marcsmith: has to win DQ and run S9 to make it|pg||

mb|p|nt|copeyj: and 9 imps to England (much needed)|pg||

mb|p|nt|mdgraham: lots of flaws - singleton black honours, the four hearts....but still tempting|pg||
nt|andyv:  this auction it's tempting for Gromov to bid 3N|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 2 level @s or N fine there|pg||
nt|lestergold: looks like an overboard hand for e/w|pg||
nt|copeyj: I would expect the twins to end in game next door (they play 14-16 NT in this position)|pg||

nt|pitiful:  but a low @c switch initially .....|pg||
nt|hawe45:  East has bad values, no thinking about a slam, not at all|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well tyhen russians have been conservative at the right time cant see the twins being as conservative|pg||
nt|haans: what would 2nt overcall have meant|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @C hook correct and the contract home.|pg||
nt|jallerton: might yet get to 7 after than majestic leap to game|pg||
nt|haans: 6 is enough|pg||
nt|jallerton: East'd double is usually 13-15 balanced|pg||

mb|p|nt|lestergold: sorry only 24|pg||

pc|h2|nt|pelu: No in practical bridge there are 2 C-losers|pg||

nt|arvidsson: troligen kommer Uppmark att spela kl från bordet|pg||

nt|jallerton: but East still interested in grand opposite @dK|pg||
pc|c4|pc|h6|nt|haans: :( better slams have been seen :)|pg||
nt|ady: 3NY at this posint a good prospect|pg||
nt|lestergold: obiously not pasrtnering david burn then|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|copeyj: Bjarnarson has done well to steer it back to @C here|pg||
nt|paulg:  a doublecross from West|pg||
pc|s4|nt|haans: @D finesse?|pg||
nt|eweber: if I remember correctly and they still play like this|pg||
pc|s3|nt|xenya: so much for slam|pg||
nt|haans: right in my opinion|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT|pg||
nt|jallerton: well he can make it if he reads the cards well|pg||
pc|sA|nt|vbman: l have to confess l found this score unexpected|pg||
nt|lestergold: this hand has some potential for england because i think 3N is likely to make if bid although it doesnt look that plain sailing|pg||
nt|copeyj: 3@C next door also I am told|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|haans: will count only 5 hearts|pg||
nt|haans: sry|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|haans: S must have singel @H|pg||
nt|jallerton: he might be forced into playing for @DKxx in North just to get up to 13 tricks|pg||
nt|paulg:  i don't think he can establish clubs unless KQ are tripleton|pg||
nt|paulg:  so I think Jeffrey is probably right|pg||
nt|jallerton: but the timing has to be careful; I'm not surprised West is taking his time here|pg||
nt|paulg:  there is also the problem of 4-1 trumps to cope with|pg||
nt|paulg:  he may have to take two spades first|pg||
nt|haans: must do a lot first|pg||
nt|jallerton: maybe hr has to cash @dJ without drawing any more trumps and then cross ruff the remainder|pg||
nt|jallerton: playing North for s/ton @s and @dKxx|pg||
nt|haans: singel @H at S|pg||
nt|haans: what did xx mean?|pg||
nt|paulg:  XX meant bid your suit, pass would have shown diamonds and presumably interest in 2@d-X|pg||
nt|haans: and 2@H?|pg||
nt|paulg:  2@h would have been natural|pg||
pc|d2|nt|koksoy: he  will  try  for 2 kings  one  is  good  ...  so  8  tricks|pg||
pc|d3|nt|rodvenn: Can west find the spade queen?|pg||
nt|andersk: I doubt he will find it|pg||
nt|Gerben42: if he is playing for 0 losers needs to start with @SQ|pg||
nt|ludewig: now he wishes he had played 3 NT|pg||
nt|dimi: true, he playing for @s 10 doubleton ...|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|lestergold: well heart lead helped|pg||
nt|lestergold: oh well|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
pc|d5|nt|shevek: another low fron xx lead|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: which is the wrong percentage play- to be honest gerben|pg||
pc|s5|nt|andersk: since @C 2-2, and as long as south can follow @S, he have 100% safeplay to hook|pg||
nt|Gerben42: @SQ wins whenever KT onside or T singleton behind|pg||
pc|dT|nt|rnmalik: true thought it would be a close match. That is the name of the game.|pg||
nt|jallerton: he may also be defeated by 6-1 hearts|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mdgraham: 4@C was a splinter - fair enough - but West has (presumably) limited his hand with 2@s|pg||
nt|henryb:  say a @d lead. Win, @sA -- can't draw trump and pitch from hand on @d|pg||
pc|hT|nt|rodvenn: strange safety in spades|pg||
nt|ady: yes|pg||
nt|copeyj: as predicted the Hacketts next door in 3NT going down|pg||
nt|lestergold: still only 8 obvious tricks tho|pg||
nt|copeyj: so this deal will see Russia take the lead|pg||
nt|arvidsson: blir N skvisad nu?|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h4|pg||
nt|haans: had north bid 4@S over 4@C then|pg||
nt|mdgraham: so whether 4@H would be "extras within the limit" is a matter for partnership agreement|pg||
nt|nyg8:  on a d lead, the best play is deep finess in S at trick on|pg||
mc|10|nt|Gerben42: but he doesnt know about @H yet|pg||
nt|nyg8:  even it it looses, 6 is still cold|pg||

nt|marcsmith: i think South should bid 2D/3D over X|pg||
nt|marcsmith: he has a bad hand with a diamond fit|pg||
nt|marcsmith: 2D/3D whichever is the weak bid|pg||
nt|april7: if  he is sure that E also has  the @S suit|pg||
nt|marcsmith: it's a tactical decision |pg||
nt|marcsmith: probably not our hand, so make things as difficult as possible|pg||
nt|marcsmith: 3D might shut West out, or might get East to misjudge if West does bid|pg||

mb|1D!|nt|copeyj: what would you do with the N hand|pg||
mb|d|nt|pelu: 1NT 15-17 (vuln)|pg||
nt|andyv:  most practical bid seems to be 3N (if not conventional)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you suspect that South is about to wheel out some System |pg||
nt|pelu: many would just bid 3NT now - u can also tranfer to 3@C and see partners reaction|pg||
nt|rnmalik: another doomed contract.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: NS can make 5@H alright.|pg||
nt|haans: 6@H odds off|pg||
nt|rnmalik: no action boards:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: i think England will open 1NT next door with the W hand (14-16) then it is unclear where the auction will go |pg||
nt|ady: west may retreat|pg||

nt|koksoy: this  not a  slemish  set|pg||
nt|mdgraham: very thin double|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lestergold: rescue transfer to hearts i assume|pg||
nt|haans: no 2 suiter|pg||
nt|hedyg: leaddirecting?|pg||
nt|Gerben42: but the essential point is that you dont knwo your @S goal without knowing if you lose @HK|pg||
nt|arvidsson: får många kloka tips om att N måste ha några HP för sin budgivning|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Ser ut som att 6 @h är ett bra kontrakt, men det kanske kan finnas fällor i det också|pg||
nt|hawe45:  A fair slam here - good chances with @H 3-2|pg||
mb|p|nt|shevek: 1NT=12-14|pg||
nt|xenya: i think it's a very good slam -- almost cold on a non-club lead and 50+% on a club lead|pg||
nt|copeyj: X penalties from Gold - and surely Dubinin will run - i suspect xx shows a 5 card suit somewhere now let's see where they end up|pg||
nt|h_karluk: interesting points : 3 "Jan" at the table (SWN) and Gunther PURKARTHOFER still with Fucik, last year their partners were Arno  Lindermann and Christoph Puersil|pg||

nt|mdgraham: that should be that|pg||

nt|hawe45:  The West-hand is fair for a 1 @H-overcall|pg||

pc|dJ|pg||
nt|jfaria: E decides for a GF |pg||
nt|h_karluk: @h lead and history|pg||
nt|jallerton: 1@d 4+@h, 1@h usually 11-14 balanced without 4 hearts|pg||
nt|hawe45:  North has maximum for ALL his bids here|pg||
nt|hedyg: more than max|pg||
pc|dK|nt|pelu: correct! u are :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: gold's second doubole musrt be for takeout|pg||
nt|copeyj: normal @C lead for Townsend I would say - and it looks like this is makeable to me|pg||
nt|lestergold: not supisingly townsend passes but this is a better spot than 2h could scramble quite  few tricks here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no, brave 3@h|pg||
nt|dimi: no road to fail|pg||
nt|mikael_w: 6 @h går nog alltid hen även om det sitter dåligt|pg||
nt|affe82: daligt?|pg||
nt|arvidsson: ja 6@H om det bjuds kommer att gå hem, därför hoppas vi på att de bjuder 6nt :)|pg||
nt|mikael_w: med @d utspel, så kan speföraren ta utspetel och spela @h, men duckar V då och S spelar en @h till så är j|pg||
nt|arvidsson: ruter sitter dåligt, spadern sitter sjukt bra|pg||
nt|mikael_w: går det nog bet om V tar och fortsätter med @h|pg||
nt|arvidsson: nej spader J sitter 3:e|pg||
pc|d5|nt|haans: but clubs most likely lead|pg||
nt|shevek: yes, played by north better (less likely @c lead)|pg||
nt|copeyj: i think it's normal to bid 3@H|pg||
nt|mamos: The women's championship is still very close   -- about half the field still in touch with the leaders|pg||
nt|rnmalik: E stepped in to rescue NS.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|andersk: probably 7 tricks|pg||
nt|copeyj: has a little something, 5th @H and no @S wastage opposite presumed shortage|pg||
nt|lestergold: well reckons his q@d working so i think he can at this colour|pg||
nt|jfaria: a @h lead will be devastating|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 1o tricks|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: but germany is far behind now in the match, and i woudnt call that unlucky|pg||
nt|arvidsson: varav det alltid står|pg||
nt|mikael_w: du har bara 3 sak, du kanske sakar en @d och slår en @s-mask|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Singel @d ut så kommer det ofta att gå bet|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|rnmalik: But this may not make-imo 4@S x is to play.|pg||
pc|c4|nt|arvidsson: varför då?|pg||
nt|mikael_w: ja hur hade du spelat efter @d ut ?|pg||
nt|arvidsson: tror inte han kommer att lägga ner några ruter, men visst det kan hända|pg||
nt|mikael_w: det handlar inte om att lägga ner, hur spelar ni efter @d ut ?|pg||
nt|arvidsson: jag stväl på handen spelar hj Q|pg||
nt|affe82: duck. @h. be till gud.|pg||
nt|arvidsson: stjäl |pg||
nt|arvidsson: sedan är det rulltårta :)|pg||
nt|mikael_w: nej det är det inte|pg||
nt|arvidsson: jo det är det 2 ingångar @H K samt @S Q kan stjäla upp rutern om jag vill då|pg||
nt|arvidsson: men som sagt sitter trumfen 4-1 kan det bli jobbigt|pg||
pc|c3|nt|pauleger: this contract can be set after simply playing 2 rounds of @h|pg||
nt|mdgraham: close though. Pard doesn't guarantee four hearts|pg||
nt|lestergold: but does gurantee 3|pg||
nt|copeyj: very likely to have short @S and thus 3@H|pg||
nt|lestergold: if not wopuld have much stronger hand|pg||
nt|haans: @DJ standard for this pair|pg||
nt|paulg:  on the card?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No trump-lead this time, Michael|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|pelu: I owe u 1, Andy|pg||
nt|rodvenn: maybe good for norway as it may be difficult to stop in 2 @h|pg||
nt|rodvenn: for NS|pg||
nt|haans: nope mot that standard|pg||
nt|haans: not|pg||
nt|mikael_w: stjäla upp @d ? skojar du?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  On a @D-lead, you might play a @H to the 10|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and now a @s switch|pg||
nt|jfaria: Paulissen would thank u for the info :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Gert supposed to find it, drums beating|pg||
pc|hT|nt|rmb1: 1NT(X)Pass = forcing to redouble|pg||
nt|arvidsson: jag kan stjäla upp rutern om jag villl, hade jag gjort det ja|pg||
nt|nyg8:  bbad D|pg||
pc|h7|nt|paulg:  it's not a nice hand to lead from, and you don't want diamonds returned, so it is a reasonable try|pg||
nt|haans: i do not like players that lead to be copied in papers|pg||
nt|arvidsson: lite beroende på vad som händer tidigare när jag spelar hj J |pg||
pc|h2|nt|rodvenn: but only 5 losers for East|pg||
nt|affe82: riskerna är väl: @h A kan ge @d stöld. men mest 4-1 i trumf. annars kan man enligt arvidssons linje dra trumf och ruffa 2@d|pg||
nt|arvidsson: duckar de och jag spelar hj mot K |pg||
nt|mikael_w: så i stick 2 spelar du !q och efter duck även @h J då. men då vet jag inte om du spelat med oddsen|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|jfaria: anything works, except @h |pg||
nt|h_karluk: however declarer still far far away to bring it home|pg||
nt|jfaria: @d dont behave|pg||
nt|jfaria: he will need @s|pg||
nt|h_karluk: say behaved|pg||
nt|mamos: dummy is short of entries here|pg||
nt|pitiful:  a double dummy @h 10 lead was the only chance|pg||
nt|mamos: but now declarer is well in control|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hA|nt|copeyj: Gold can make this if he reads it perfectly, and England in 2@S next door (likely to make)|pg||
nt|copeyj: so some chance for a dbl partscore swing|pg||
nt|arvidsson: jag spelar en liten hj mot K i stick 3, |pg||
nt|mikael_w: ja, men det är oerhört lätt när man ser alla kort, men jag kan nog lova att du inte spelar brickan på bästa sätt om du spelar så|pg||
pc|h3|nt|mdgraham: I knew it. One of my partners wants to play 1NT-3NT as a minor suit slam try :) |pg||
nt|pelu: the danger for N is to lose to a @S-H and then @S back and @D = 5 losers - no problem with both @S H in East|pg||
nt|jfaria: ther it goes|pg||
nt|haans: 2nd opinion: beboeloek: heart lead maybe better on this hand|pg||
nt|haans: my man :)|pg||
nt|arvidsson: jag tror att det är rätt spelföring Micke|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|andyv:  as a spec also pointed out Kxx in W hand also a good reason not take finesse|pg||
nt|henryb:  unless the defense gives away the contract, of course|pg||
pc|s8|nt|rnmalik: nothing does. such a hand.|pg||
nt|koksoy: Denmark  is increasing  pressure  for th 9th chair|pg||
nt|nyg8:  why play C when S can be risky|pg||
nt|nyg8:  S is safe- club is riksy|pg||
pc|s4|nt|xenya: this, however, is a coffee hand -- which reminds me... brb|pg||
nt|lestergold: now dim club dim and what does north do|pg||
nt|copeyj: can play a number of lines now|pg||
nt|lestergold: al defence can come to now surely are two trump tricks one way or the other|pg||
nt|koksoy: 40-0|pg||
nt|henryb:  either black suit concedes the contract: only @hA and a @h (probably) leads to defeat|pg||
nt|nyg8:  After aH and H can make contract by wining in dummy and play small S.|pg||
nt|daman: all roads lead to +140|pg||
pc|sK|nt|rodvenn: direct losers|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Really bad luck, with this lead, declarer only needs trumps 3-2 and @s-suit fair|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|jfaria: next pl|pg||
nt|arvidsson: att spela QJ i hj, sitter hj 3-2 är det matte hemma|pg||
nt|henryb:  yes, but unlikely to make that play|pg||
nt|nyg8:  If S pops up with K then he can throw 2C loosers on sAQ|pg||
mc|9|nt|h_karluk: i don't know, 2@c fine but..whatever|pg||

nt|affe82: eller bada.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Quite normal 3 NT here|pg||
nt|koksoy: this  board could be punishment for Denmark  but Estonia missed a  chance for 5 or 8 hundred|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|h_karluk: both vul and weak NT in action|pg||
nt|lestergold: 15 the deficit and 8 boards to go so eng still has chacne to reverse this|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  S hand looks like a 1N opener|pg||
nt|lestergold: deficit|pg||
nt|jfaria: those hands are tricky, 8 hc points and a void... facing 1nt|pg||
nt|dimi: 6@h cannot be beaten|pg||
nt|Gerben42: Elinescu wont like 2@S behind his @SK|pg||
nt|henryb:  and might make even if the @s is off if the same player has 4@s and 3@c|pg||
mb|3N!|nt|copeyj: will this end in 2@SX e/w? that would not be pleasant for them|pg||
nt|jallerton: the Sweded missed a decent game in the other room|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Ouf - TOO strong for 1 NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: Operator - I know it is diff - but dont claim 10 tricks when opp has taken 4 tricks, pl :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: But you had given up:)|pg||
nt|shevek: bd 10 was not passed in as we thought|pg||
nt|haans: SW other side of screen|pg||
nt|mamos: all these players have lots of medals and championships to their names|pg||
nt|andreasw:  this is he's fault|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Welcome |pg||
nt|janhamhurg: but 6 club is better, but since 2 keycard are missing 6 isnt an option i thk|pg||
nt|arvidsson: väldigt få brickor som är självklara, oftast brukar man finna någon dålig variant att spela på, men finns en anledning varför jag inte spelar utan sitter här och kommenterar|pg||
nt|affe82: med en gynsam @s sits. var väl även linjen med vinst(kasta @c) liten hj. kassaskap? kan fa en giss om maska med @h8 när en hypotetisk E vinner @h k med A..|pg||
nt|koksoy: you  know  1100  is  an  emergency  number in  every  country  so  I told about  800  :)|pg||
nt|nyg8:  and there were some clues as if N hehlp SK, HA, and AK of D he would open 1N|pg||
mb|4H|nt|haans: duly noted|pg||
nt|jallerton: as have the English|pg||
mb|p|nt|pauleger: i think its some sort of kokish here|pg||
nt|haans: both :)|pg||
nt|pitiful:  they only have 1 schedule match in open today so they replay this pm|pg||
nt|pitiful:  sorry private|pg||
nt|eweber: this is very true, we are watching one of the strongest matches of the whole women tournament|pg||
nt|hawe45:  4 @H is lay-down|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 4 sp is -1 only|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: or - 2 if a ruff comes|pg||
nt|Gerben42: running scores: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/10Ostend/Results.htm|pg||
nt|arvidsson: men vi glömmer den brickan och spanar på denna intressanta giv|pg||
nt|arvidsson: trots gynsam sit ser 3nt väldigt skakigt ut|pg||
nt|mikael_w: japp :) håller med Arvidsson :) BRB, rökpause|pg||
nt|affe82: westerlund bör som jag lära sig att sitta pa verandan. da behöver man inte ga ifran oavsett begär.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: pass must be forcing byh west i assume|pg||
nt|ady: this time e/w are in difficulties|pg||
nt|copeyj: assume this shows @D and a major|pg||
nt|jfaria: E hand must be limited, otherwise not easy to stop at 2 level|pg||
nt|paulg:  i suppose if you are going to miss the game, then stopping at the one level is optimal|pg||
nt|andreasw:  should be 9 trick's unleass he guess the @h Q|pg||
nt|andreasw:  unless|pg||
nt|dimi: hello Hans and Specs|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: i expect similar result by OR|pg||
nt|copeyj: going to get away with it i think - townsend cld pass and collect a nice penalty but not so easy not to bid his 5 card @h suit here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: bet 1NT shows spades|pg||
nt|haans: hard to like @DK|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: sorry always -2|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: bidding clubs 3 times is a miracle to me- sorry|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Magnus Eriksson hade en intressant sak från förra brickan också, stjäl ni utspelet och sedan spelar trumf och sedan stjäl upp @d så måste ni stjäla högt, och då får vär V ett ...|pg||
nt|mikael_w: trumfspel?|pg||
nt|mikael_w: BRB|pg||
nt|koksoy: 10  tricks|pg||
nt|henryb:  they play 14+ 1NT?|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|andyv:  not sure why the 2@h raise|pg||
nt|jfaria: told it showed 11-13 ty kib :)|pg||
nt|nyg8:  and the Q or J of clubs|pg||
pc|c9|nt|pelu: 1@C = 12-14 or 18-19 Ball., or natural @C|pg||
nt|shevek: guess south opened 1NT and played there|pg||
nt|jallerton: at least the Swedes tried to get to game|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  my team has its debuit here, but our first victory was vs.England - 16 to 14 - sensation for us|pg||
nt|ludewig: South shows some club support, he did not bid 4@H immediately|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: a kibitz says pass over 4 spade would have been forcing- im not so sure about that|pg||
nt|henryb:  if 15-17, then North could have no club honor|pg||
nt|henryb:  or an unbalanced hand|pg||
nt|nyg8:  that was my point - am jsut saying there were some clues the S had SK|pg||
nt|henryb:  Perverse Flannery opener|pg||
nt|henryb:  5=4 in majors rather than 4=5|pg||
nt|henryb:  presumably they canape, and reverses show extras|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 5+@S, 4+@h, 8-14 hcp. Quite a wide range|pg||
nt|nyg8:  that sounds right. E has now tough decision|pg||
nt|nyg8:  going up with the A will set up 2C tricks for D discard|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3NT showed 5422 maximum|pg||
pc|cA|nt|rnmalik: ace less 12. |pg||
nt|hawe45:  He would open 1 NT also wit a 4-card @D - and here he has two more tricks|pg||
nt|rnmalik: so found the fit, afterx.|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|shevek: unsuccessfully|pg||
nt|pauleger: you will make 4@s although you have 3 loosers in @h and @c, because you wont finesse against the dangerous opponent|pg||
nt|copeyj: dubinin made a good decision on this deal to show a 2 suiter|pg||
nt|ady: looks like n/s will take their vuln game|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3N looks a better spot than 4H|pg||
nt|h_karluk: with 2 hcp?|pg||
nt|arvidsson: hm ett bra kontrakt landade de i, vågar vi hoppas på spader ut och sedan hj till A och mera hj ? så det blir en snabb resa tillö hemgång|pg||
nt|affe82: visst @h A som det sitter. det blir jobbigt om w startade med 9xxx och E med Asingel.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Open 1 @D and jump to 2 NT|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Hello|pg||
nt|henryb:  and ducking might lose the @cA if declarer has @dKQx|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|nt|shevek: the cards are not very friendly here|pg||
nt|haans: 2@S must have been spades + clubs Häxan in sweden |pg||
nt|copeyj: yes although both probably make|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6 on a non club lead|pg||
nt|mamos: think this is coffee hand :)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 5@CX+1 is more than slam|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 1400 vs 1370|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: that scores well no sos on level 5:)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: XX I mean|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 5@CXX+1 , without redouble slam is more|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: is north thinking? if he bids i leave:)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: north and east are on 1 side - operator enters two bids at the time|pg||
nt|ludewig: the operator puts in bids for N and E at the same time, so East is thinking I think|pg||
nt|dimi: E will not feel comfortable|pg||
nt|Gerben42: East just showed support in an auction in which opps are strong |pg||
nt|vugraphzns: N is thinking|pg||
nt|nyg8:  also true. Tough guess|pg||
pc|d7|nt|arvidsson: ska fi spela massa trumf på oss|pg||
nt|koksoy: I prefer  second  double  from  S|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Dear collegue - 4 @H lay-down = 10 tricks, they will regret, that they didÂ´nr RD|pg||
nt|Gerben42: woww|pg||
nt|arvidsson: som det sitter, men hoppas på att de attackerar hj s¨vi går hem|pg||
nt|arvidsson: bra trumfvända från S|pg||
nt|nyg8:  so it seems that 5 is cold|pg||
pc|c2|nt|pauleger: with @hs behaving this will make easily|pg||
nt|haans: W has on other bid yes|pg||
nt|paulg:  embarrassing to make eleven tricks in a one-level contract|pg||
nt|haans: have we not all been there?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  1130 against possible 1370|pg||
nt|Gerben42: might be the start of a German comeback?|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: its not that easy- we will see|pg||
pc|c5|nt|lestergold: yeh hearts is hard work tho shouldmake|pg||
nt|haans: even today|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Oh-oh - only 600...|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|h_karluk: cake and walk|pg||
nt|copeyj: not that hard - especially if that lead reveals that KQ@D both with E (likely on auction anyway)|pg||
nt|lestergold: well the dim position is fortunate |pg||
nt|rmb1: What was 3D(X)P - attempt to right-side 3NT?|pg||
nt|arvidsson: men fortfarande hemma (då inget kan hota en stöld)|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|rnmalik: May take the right view in @S as well.|pg||
nt|lestergold: lose 2h and a dim|pg||
nt|hawe45:  So "WE" get 11 IMP|pg||
nt|Gerben42: on this lead can make all tricks even... 1800|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: we see 13 tricks, but imagine cl 3-1 and king of hearts offside|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|h_karluk: i think after X NT was out of issue sir|pg||
nt|lestergold: brb|pg||
pc|h2|nt|pelu: better bid 1. time - u know that u never will have 1@H when u have fit - sp better take space|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|andyv:  with 4-3-3-3 14hcp + 2 10s, S hand just felt like 1N opener esp. over a passed pd.|pg||
nt|dimi: One swallow does not make a summer ...|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: i doubt that that is an english saying----|pg||
pc|h4|nt|jfaria: in any case (maybe 14) easy for W to pass...|pg||
nt|Gerben42: update on board  10 - apparently the table result was 5@S making, but score adjusted by director to 5@H-1 ; Germany can appeal until 30 minutes after end of match|pg||
nt|Gerben42: reason for adjustment was a break in tempo (BIT) from Elinescu|pg||
pc|hK|nt|eweber: for those interested in CCs and other stuff: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/Events/ebl/2010ostend/default.asp |pg||
pc|h8|nt|rnmalik: nicely bid and with @S 3/3 makes.|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
pc|cT|nt|haans: You may called it Gazzilli in Sweden we call it Häxan|pg||
nt|haans: 2@C becaused 2@C would have been relay|pg||
nt|xenya: down 1 if Fallenius gets @Cs right -- more if he doesn't|pg||
nt|haans: he does 50% of time :)|pg||
pc|cK|nt|hedyg: now a promotion?|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|hedyg: so much for laydown|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|Gerben42: the play did seem irregular on  10 - now we know why|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: now he needs cl 22 and heart 22- not sure that line was best|pg||
nt|henryb:  Now it seems cold by playing trumps unless they are 5-0, but should not play @dA first|pg||
nt|daman: 5 looked cold to me|pg||
nt|nyg8:  once a played the hA he opened the Door to a club ruff|pg||
mc|10|nt|henryb:  It was, if declarer played trump before clearing @c|pg||
pg||

mb|1H|mb|p|mb|2C!|mb|p|mb|2D!|mb|p|mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|marcsmith: a spade lead will give declarer 8 tricks|pg||
nt|marcsmith: and a heart guess for 9|pg||
nt|marcsmith: or set up club for 9|pg||
nt|marcsmith: a minor-suit lead probably beats the contract|pg||
pc|s2|nt|marcsmith: declarer is favourite now|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sJ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|marcsmith: that's the lead that gives declarer the easiest job|pg||
nt|april7: the @H suit has to be guessed or giving up first a @C, because @S are 4-4|pg||
nt|drorp: yes, 2@S|pg||
pc|s3|nt|marcsmith: yes, can still go down if he plays on hearts and misguesses, but he's not doing that|pg||
nt|marcsmith: he'll find out spades are 4-4 now and then play on clubs|pg||
nt|april7: he' l ask the opponents how they lead against NT|pg||
nt|marcsmith: hard for North to find the diamond lead|pg||
nt|marcsmith: how long to they get for 20 boards?|pg||
nt|marcsmith: must be getting close to sruggling for time here now|pg||
nt|marcsmith: has been very slow|pg||
nt|vugraphznp: 2 hours 50 |pg||

nt|xenya: again, the way the play was shown here, the result should be 2 off, not 3 |pg||
nt|haans: when do you have a solid suit?|pg||
nt|shevek: back to part scores....|pg||
nt|haans: or not|pg||
nt|rodvenn: interesting hand|pg||
nt|rodvenn: 6 @d is rasonable contract|pg||
nt|andersk: 3 @S or 4@S overcall|pg||
nt|rodvenn: reasonable|pg||
nt|rodvenn: but needs 2 finesses|pg||
nt|rodvenn: if eager bidding, everybody may bid too high for safety|pg||
nt|andersk: 6@D can be set with a @C ruff|pg||
nt|rodvenn: and then norway must find club ruff against 6 @d|pg||
nt|rodvenn: but nomrla opening is 1@d with East|pg||
nt|rodvenn: then 2 of @s lead will be lavinthal for club ruff|pg||
nt|pauleger: so he took the best line not knowing @hs behave|pg||
nt|pauleger: 6NT here|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Sorry for miscounting, 1130 was never in question, but 930 by playing @C earlier|pg||
nt|nyg8:  i the SA and then double finess in H is a better play|pg||
nt|nyg8:  i would havr played the SA and then double finessed H|pg||
nt|vugraphzns: toilet break for 3 players|pg||
nt|nyg8:  3N will be bid but not make if N unblocks the cQ and does not lead S|pg||
nt|nyg8:  this is an interesting hand. One assumes that W will be declare|pg||
nt|henryb:  bye all. Work calls|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: 3nt ?|pg||
nt|rodvenn: yes. here we go!|pg||
nt|andersk: I have a feeling that many NS will make 4 @S|pg||
nt|rodvenn: how much shd South bid?|pg||
nt|eweber: looking back to board 6 and 8, the two swings, in both cases the English were one of two teams in the whole women tournament to earn these imps, congratulations!|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: yet another big @C for Dubinin - amazing number in one set|pg||
nt|jallerton: yes, some of us have made +5 too!|pg||
nt|andreasw:  another slam|pg||
nt|affe82: claimade han inte 10?|pg||
nt|nyg8:  on a passived D lead and unblock of cQ, S gains an entry in C and they can take 4S and a C|pg||
mb|1N|nt|haans: time to bid Fredin|pg||
nt|jallerton: 3@s should show a reasonable hand here as borderline hands can pass and bid 3@s on next round|pg||
nt|jallerton: Justin Hackett chose 3@s after same start to auction|pg||
nt|haans: he have cards for 3@S|pg||
nt|jallerton: perhaps he is considering 2NT|pg||
nt|haans: pass now bid 3@S later no no no|pg||
nt|paulg:  the hand is not so great, three small diamonds, heart poorly placed ... 3@s looks normal|pg||
nt|pitiful:  2@d @s and another|pg||
nt|mamos: 10-12|pg||
nt|hedyg: multi 2@d|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 1@C can be 2|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Aj då. nu ser vi att 6 @h gick en bet vid andra bordet :( men det berodde väl mest på att dom fick den på fel hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|shevek: far from it|pg||
nt|Gerben42: should have said "safe" rather than safe |pg||
nt|hawe45:  More - no-swing-boards - 10 or 11 tricks in 4 @H|pg||
nt|daman: the @H suit has some promise|pg||
nt|nyg8:  but bery hard defence|pg||
mb|2C|nt|pelu: :(:(|pg||
nt|rodvenn: pass. inviteing 6?|pg||
nt|andersk: a safe 5@S from Ekren|pg||
nt|andersk: I suppose pass should be invite|pg||
nt|rodvenn: but this is not a clear forcing pass situation?|pg||
nt|rodvenn: nobody vulnerable|pg||
nt|andersk: I think it is clear|pg||
nt|haans: take out x had been better that 3nt|pg||
nt|arvidsson: ja blev svårare från andra handen med kl genom AQ|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodvenn: no forcing bids from EW|pg||
nt|rodvenn: why do you think it is clear? 4 spades may be a strong hand|pg||
nt|andersk: what is worse case, to pay out 650 instead of 450|pg||
nt|rnmalik: how would they bid, lets see.|pg||
nt|pauleger: 6NT played in the open room|pg||
nt|rnmalik: J@D dropping makeable contract 6NT.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 5@D+4@S+2@H+1@C=12.|pg||
mb|2D|nt|rnmalik: W thinking 6 or 7. 4@C RKC imo.|pg||
nt|haans: but all bids have a cost|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: hard to reach a club contract- weired x here, their style i thk to x with 15 +|pg||
nt|rnmalik: slam time, 6@H for NS, lose 1@D only. K@C rightly placed but should not be bid.|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: Correctly pointed out 7 covered by 8, would have a different story.|pg||
nt|nyg8:  unfortuntately, H lead sets up 4H tricks|pg||
mb|2N|nt|rodvenn: ok. let us see if the 2 of @s comes as i predicted|pg||
nt|andersk: looks like EW agrees that it was forceing.....sometime when opo is agressive....you just have to keep agreements|pg||
nt|rodvenn: peaple have different agrrements as to what is forcing pass sit|pg||
nt|rodvenn: Ingmarsson probably had a good agreement and could pass|pg||
nt|rmb1: 1@S not alerted this time :)|pg||
nt|copeyj: the 6th|pg||
nt|ady: part score only   |pg||
nt|h_karluk: i expect 41s|pg||
nt|haans: inn in spades low dim|pg||
nt|h_karluk: seems Fucik and Gunther have to find another swing to win, so far Jan and Gert slowly slowly approach|pg||
nt|rnmalik: been|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: oh i see:)|pg||
nt|affe82: men den sista 5an maste vara en felscoring. tror det star 34-24, väl?|pg||
mb|p|nt|pauleger: 4@d: i dont like to play slam|pg||
nt|lestergold: any black suit part score looks ok|pg||
nt|arvidsson: jag är inne på din linje fredrik borde vara 24-24|pg||
nt|arvidsson: 34-24|pg||
mb|3N|nt|pelu: in modern bridge it is imp0ossible to find a @C-fit :) - bidding @C- never mean @Cs :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  why is it when you decide to open a hand like E's, you always end up in 2NT?|pg||
nt|andersk: I think pass must be an invite against any "real" 5@D and no invite against a save 5@D bid|pg||
nt|rodvenn: now Ekren will not find the club shift i think|pg||
nt|pauleger: rest: answering RKCB|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 4@s|pg||
nt|lestergold: lousy contract and a shortage of entries to fimnesse dims twice|pg||
nt|copeyj: as does a NT partial i think|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S too high  unless a diamond lead|pg||
nt|h_karluk: with 18 and 5134 i cannot imagine a partscore|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: an easy make|pg||
nt|jfaria: this time 1@c is what it most often is : weak bal|pg||
nt|dimi: EW can make 4@h if they get everything right|pg||
nt|hawe45:  They need nothing right - at least  10 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|shevek: with the black aces in the right place, this will make|pg||
nt|hedyg: now 3NT?|pg||
nt|hedyg: as in OR|pg||
nt|mikael_w: bra spelat av S som lägger @s K här :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: spots decent worths to push|pg||
nt|lestergold: clubs could make a lot of tricks witgh the two three three breaks|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and both sides were nonvul|pg||
nt|ady: can make 11 tricks in clubs without a heart lead  |pg||
nt|haans: odd for lead from A|pg||
nt|haans: harder to lead from Q|pg||
nt|rnmalik: now it will make. K@D the best chance.|pg||
nt|haans: here a big difference from MP|pg||
nt|haans: lead from Q as sort of psyche|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  with bidding suggested @d lead, declarer has little chance|pg||
nt|eweber: was there a misunderstanding?|pg||
nt|pitiful:  lots of bidding here|pg||
nt|mamos: defence has at least one mor chance to find Diamond tricks|pg||
nt|pitiful:  I expect north did not mean 3@h as invite|pg||
nt|eweber: seeing the North hand I would assume 3@h was meant as not inv opposite a 10-12|pg||
nt|pitiful:  probably thinks 3@d is available as game try|pg||
nt|nyg8:  but that is still on 8 tricks|pg||
nt|nyg8:  lets see.|pg||
pc|h4|nt|lestergold: any rate nice safe spot|pg||
nt|nyg8:  hmm. lets see if they find the magic defence|pg||

pc|h6|nt|mamos: do we know what double showed?|pg||
nt|dimi: doctores are not that brave today|pg||
pc|hT|nt|xenya: the score that we see on our screens should be ignored -- too many errors -- see board 7, for instance|pg||
nt|shevek: hmmmm|pg||
nt|jfaria: no way to loose 6 tricks|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  or 2@s - if @s suit is known|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Allt för att ge sken av att han har 2 st @h så att V skall ducka när @h spelas mot bordet|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|hedyg: i assume they dont play lebensohl here after the double|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Men denna gången spelar det ingen roll när V har ALLT i @h|pg||
nt|affe82: bra offring ock|pg||
pc|c3|nt|h_karluk: @S j now and @h hook needed for the jack, rest cake and walk|pg||
nt|jfaria: y, extra trick depends on handling @h|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so NS gets a @s, a @h and 2 @d|pg||
pc|c2|nt|hedyg: else N should have continued|pg||
nt|nyg8:  that was the point before. N must unblock the cQ to give S and entry|pg||
pc|cK|nt|pelu: and 3@C over 2NT prob forcing - so thats not an option|pg||

nt|janhamhurg: its hard to play 3 matches a day- against tough opponents- so you lose concentration sometimes|pg||
pc|cA|nt|pelu: in the "good old days" - before 1NT F1 - u could bid 2@C in East|pg||
nt|andyv:  it would be for me|pg||

mb|p|mb|1D|nt|shevek: yes, once the team mates sit the same way :)|pg||

nt|hedyg: not strange at all really|pg||

nt|Gerben42: really 5@H?|pg||
nt|vugraphzns: yes|pg||
nt|arvidsson: mot 3spader tänkte du då?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Good and fast bid 6 @D here|pg||

mb|1S|nt|jallerton: 3 imps if 4@s made exactly|pg||

nt|hedyg: yes here also 2@H= 5@H +4m|pg||
nt|Gerben42: ?!|pg||
mb|3C|nt|pelu: transfer to @S (4+) could have a longer minor|pg||
nt|andyv:  20-20 hands usually don't travel too far in the bidding|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South likely to bid 2@S - unless 3@D would be a splinter|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and the hand is a bit weak for that action|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|paulg:  just trying to help Hans|pg||

nt|eweber: 5 Imps for GER in board 10, Sally bid 2NT vs this wk2 on @h 10xxxxxx, ending up in 3@sX for 800|pg||
nt|mamos: id guess that germany are winning the match at the moment|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2NT asks|pg||
nt|affe82: sry. sant.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: South undeterred.... |pg||
nt|andyv:  good call, Mike|pg||
nt|haans: and how many deals until you found out?|pg||
nt|pauleger: unfortunately i have to mention, that he took the best line in @d|pg||
nt|pauleger: the book will say cash one top@d and then finesse|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Against 6NT in OR @S was led and E played AK@D and made the contract.|pg||
nt|haans: 4 down to equal score|pg||
nt|eweber: making this incredible 4@h will bring in some more!|pg||
nt|affe82: missade 44an i @h|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodvenn: puppet|pg||
nt|jallerton: dyou agree with South's 2nd pass?|pg||
nt|Gerben42: showing @S or @C and @D I guess :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  200 % - wo wohnst Du (ruhig, Ich komme nicht...?)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Sorry, private|pg||
nt|hawe45:  What does 3 @D mean - with so good cards?|pg||
mb|d|nt|h_karluk: surprised to watch off-beat weak bicolor opening|pg||
nt|copeyj: pretty sure it is cold on @C lead mike.. @S to A, ruff, @D to Q, ruff @S, @H to A, ruff @S, cross to @D and pitch @C|pg||
nt|paulg:  i would definitely bid|pg||
nt|haans: to much in @D|pg||

nt|h_karluk: over x not|pg||
nt|jallerton: no, Jason Hackett is playing, not commentating.  He bid 1@h|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 6@D = pass with minors, bid 6@S otherwise|pg||

nt|h_karluk: as a passed|pg||
nt|hawe45:  What would 2 @S mean after 2 @H?|pg||
nt|Gerben42: it all makes sense now, in a crazy way|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: great lead!|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  although stiff Aces are not a favorite to show as splinters|pg||
nt|lestergold: what then?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that's the question|pg||
nt|ady: 3@D  I would think is a break  showing good clubs|pg||
nt|andreasw:  my guess is to stand|pg||
nt|hedyg:  7 @ss no interest any other suit|pg||
nt|Gerben42: bad timing for the agressive move by W|pg||
nt|ludewig: over 1@S from S nobody would bid less than 4 or maybe 5NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: 3@D look like and overbid, 1@H from N could be very weak|pg||
nt|rmb1: 2@S used to be a bad preempt in any suit.  Do they still play that?  It is brown sticker, is it allowed?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: seems just a seam in their sys|pg||
nt|h_karluk: brown supposedly allowed|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Ah - I see...|pg||
mb|p|nt|andersk: 2 key's missing, should stop in 5@S|pg||
nt|lestergold: in some nbooks its simply a minimum 1 @s opener|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i guess even red stickers|pg||
nt|ady: west baled out as soon as possible|pg||
nt|hedyg: something like that|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Ah - East also bids West cards - I see|pg||
nt|mdgraham: can you confirm result on14, Thierry? |pg||
nt|nyg8:  why not X 3S?|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|paulg:  a lot is down to style too ... would Fredin double if the ace of diamonds were the ace of spades?|pg||
nt|mamos: Its useful to play 2@S as natural here after t/o double and South's 1@S|pg||
pc|c2|nt|andyv:  not a favorite to make|pg||
nt|pelu: but there are 10 tricks on cross-ruff|pg||
nt|andyv:  I see 9|pg||
nt|pelu: - oh wrong calculation - lets try again|pg||
nt|xenya: N must be disgusted to see the singleton @D is the Ace|pg||
nt|pelu: give S @CA and a fine game|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Vladimir|pg||
nt|mdgraham: a friend of mine comments that a trump lead would defeat this  - and I think he is right|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Andy -- and everyone|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but v diff to find a trump from Qx  |pg||
nt|rnmalik: We are at Board 15, any idea about the score?|pg||
nt|andersk: I dont understand 5@D>, maybe 4@D is trelde?|pg||
nt|lestergold: can t cross to the second dim because of the 9 dims doubleton q was only dimn higher  in dummy|pg||
nt|copeyj: 3@D in townsend's hand|pg||
nt|jallerton: at "red" opposite a passed partner?  I suspect not|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  agree. S can bid @s as psychic, having good @d fit (if N's opening shows @d)|pg||
nt|mamos: declarer has work to do|pg||
nt|hawe45:  The ending of thos match will be very bad for Slovakia - very expensive, and Germany needs it|pg||
nt|hawe45:  With such a good hand, West should - having passed - bid 3 @H|pg||
pc|c6|nt|xenya: interestingly, 4@H could be beaten on the lead of a SMALL spade|pg||
nt|haans: as kibs say EW took+ 200 at or so ...|pg||
nt|mikael_w: det här ser ut som ett sterilt kontrakt, när @h sitter så här|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|rodvenn: so what is 5 @d?|pg||
nt|Gerben42: psychologically +1000 +800 will do the Germans well|pg||
pc|h2|nt|haans: let them count to tired|pg||
nt|eweber: Heather must know that she is playing against 4 trumps in the South hand now|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: but its hard to stop below 5 clubs- so the gain might be just 300|pg||
nt|Gerben42: in std system the auction might go: 1@S (2NT) pass (3@D) ; 3@H (4@C) Dbl end|pg||
pc|h7|nt|pelu: no running score - no results from Op - so ...........:(:(|pg||
nt|rodvenn: ok now a lightner double?|pg||
nt|andersk: does he beleve 4 key's?|pg||
nt|rodvenn: 4 @d natural?|pg||
nt|andersk: 5@C 03 5@D 14 and @D K?|pg||
nt|andersk: then they will bid 7|pg||
nt|copeyj: cash two rounds @D and cross with third|pg||
nt|lestergold: well this unofrtunately is a bridge or two too far even 1n was in danger as cards are spitting here|pg||
nt|koksoy: coservative  style  of  N if  he  has  responded  with  5 points  they  will  reach better 3@C contract|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|lestergold: east may have to drop tye stiff HK with no obvious entries tov finesse the heart|pg||
nt|arvidsson: ja 10 enkla kommer det nog att bli|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: not with 7-6 gerben!|pg||
nt|Gerben42: bidding 4@C voluntarily on this auction surely shows my hand with pd promising nothing|pg||
nt|ludewig: the other table is in 5D with S to bid (after 1Club - 4NT)|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: now a spade is best|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lestergold: anolther swin g to denmark undoubetdly|pg||
nt|lestergold: Noty convinced Townsend had an acceptance of the invite|pg||
nt|hedyg: why 10@c?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Why not?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|eweber: trying for a cross ruff is the logical consequence|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Has the 9 himself|pg||
nt|hedyg: exactly!|pg||
pc|s8|nt|andersk: this looks strange|pg||
nt|hedyg: why not allow opps to make a mistake and play A@c?|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: might be - 5 now|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|xenya: then, when E gets in with a @SK, he plays a club --curtains|pg||
nt|andersk: I have never seen top players bid 5@D before with 2 key's, must be something we dont know|pg||
pc|s9|nt|andyv:  gromov reluctant to lead @ss still|pg||
nt|pauleger: because some specs tell me a different thing, maybe have a look here|pg||
nt|lestergold: not great when yiour five card suit is to the 8 spot|pg||
nt|mamos: this is a good line with @CK dropping in three|pg||
pc|sK|nt|pauleger: http://www.bridgehands.com/S/Suit_Combination_1.htm|pg||
nt|ady: might have been more difficult and exiting if north had raised to 3@S|pg||
nt|lestergold: still understandable when u feel u have to push for imps usually resuolts in even bigger loss|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Efterssom Björn Fallenius är här inne och tittar nu också så passar vi naturligtvis på att gratulera till mycket bra spel såhär långt :)|pg||
nt|arvidsson: ja ser väldigt stabilt ut, tur man han med och lägga en liten slant på betfair|pg||
pc|c4|nt|lestergold: 8@h reverse attitude i assume|pg||
nt|copeyj: yes they play standard carding but rev att first discard|pg||
nt|h_karluk: last 5 boards always could cause traumatic results, pressure rise|pg||
nt|rmb1: On up-to-date convention card: 2@S = 8-13 5@S + 4+@C|pg||
nt|copeyj: that is correct|pg||
nt|copeyj: they used to play it as something else|pg||
nt|copeyj: but changed fairly recently|pg||
nt|lestergold: in that case that explains townsend's choice|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i don't know what they call in England, in USA 'tartan' bicolors - weak 5-5, long long years ago was popular, nowadays very rare to see|pg||
nt|copeyj: this tool eliminates a problem hand given their transfer structure over 1@S-1N|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|Gerben42: this hand is a trap for all EW|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: all clear now- so he will play a dia|pg||
nt|ludewig: same contract in the other room|pg||
pc|hA|nt|eweber: without NS auction one would probably have tried finessing in @d|pg||
nt|Gerben42: esp. after strong @C from S, West will be motivated to push higher|pg||
nt|Gerben42: so far scores on  15 range from 1100 NS to 1700 EW|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: perfect defence will give germany some needed imps|pg||
nt|Gerben42: make that +2200 to -1700|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h5|nt|haans: thats not low spade lead|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 6@Dxx -5 until 6@Sx-6|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|paulg:  i think it is definitely a hand worth looking at closely ... how often will balancing be right|pg||
pc|cA|nt|haans: yes it was|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I guess you don't like to hang in 2NT when there's a sniff of game, and @SK10x must have looked good   |pg||
nt|paulg:  is this layout almost pre-destined?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|h_karluk: probably|pg||
pc|c8|nt|haans: do not balance in long in their suit = p have no points|pg||

nt|haans: dirty 2nt|pg||
nt|jallerton: West has an awkward hand playing strong NT.  What should he rebid?|pg||
nt|haans: 1nt my choice but see u point|pg||
nt|jallerton: weak NT players would rebid 1NT and say "what is the problem?"|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|paulg:  i think 2NT is fine when partner has shown values|pg||
nt|haans: weak nt for pairs |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  but disciplinied pass followed...|pg||
pc|sT|nt|Gerben42: reward for a most quiet auction goes to Jansma - Paulissen|pg||
pc|sA|nt|pelu: but late arivel can explain|pg||
nt|pauleger: piekarek tested @ss first to check, how they behave|pg||
nt|h_karluk: maybe 7 :P|pg||
nt|copeyj: 4@C from Dubinin now? or 4@h?|pg||
nt|copeyj: he has a super fly hand|pg||
nt|h_karluk: which given layout makes|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|jfaria: no strugle, a very good board for NL|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i did not mention to find @h jack, but i believed that was easy after opening bid |pg||
nt|arvidsson: borde vara enkel att bjuda|pg||
nt|vugraphzns: +1|pg||
nt|nyg8:  perfect D leads to 11 tricks for EW but hard to see that|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ok, thanks|pg||
pc|s4|nt|lestergold: well being an english commentator im not allowed bias or have fabtasies about the twions bidding 7 and the ussians bidding 6|pg||
nt|copeyj: wonder if this might be a 6 keycard situation for some pairs|pg||
nt|vasmar: Good evening all|pg||
nt|h_karluk: welcome to Vassilis Virvidakis|pg||
nt|paulg:  the diamond break will kill this, even on a low spade lead|pg||
nt|jallerton: South did very well to make 1NT on the other room|pg||
nt|vugraphzns: Thank you to all |pg||
nt|dimi: 12 imps, nice |pg||
nt|Gerben42: 1@S (2NT) p (p); 3@H (4@C) X end - 300|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Ouf - rebid of J 7 5 3 2 - call a doctor|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|h_karluk: for slam you do not need @h hook, for grandslam you need and it works|pg||
nt|haans: 1nt less underbid that 2nt is overbid|pg||
nt|mikael_w: enkel att bjuda, men skall spelas hem också :)|pg||
nt|arvidsson: svårigheterna är att visa upp singel ruter och bra spader|pg||
nt|mikael_w: krävs väl rättgiss i @h|pg||
nt|hawe45:  West should naturally bid 2 @D|pg||
pc|sK|nt|andyv:  2@h the extent of this hand|pg||
nt|rodvenn: Usually Norway bids these Norwegian slams|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|pelu: some would X in N in 3. round NS easy make 9 tricks i minor|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so for slam that's perfect, for grandslam 50-50|pg||
nt|haans: 1nt 11-13 |pg||
nt|jfaria: wonder how many EW will have the guts to bid ...|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hi|pg||
nt|paulg:  South's silence over the double was heard by Fredin|pg||
nt|arvidsson: att spela hem denna tror jag de klarar|pg||
nt|arvidsson: nej de kastar en hj på kl|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|h_karluk: given layout everything on the right spot|pg||
nt|jfaria: hi|pg||
nt|haans: lead going for blood|pg||
nt|toniemme: qui dopo attacco a @D è più fatrtibile il gioco di sorpasso a @C dato che il mancato intervento di sud farà piazzare al giocante il k@C in nord..|pg||
pc|c7|nt|rnmalik: True pass from N looked unreal.|pg||
nt|arvidsson: krävs uttrumfning|pg||
pc|s2|nt|pelu: need to find the @s-ruff to defeat 2@h|pg||
nt|xenya: the 2@H bid has proved rather fortunate here|pg||
nt|andyv:  certainly the vul is right|pg||
nt|pelu: and if partner bid @S then he has played on 4-3 before :)|pg||
nt|mikael_w: oppps, såg inte att det var AK på bordet :)|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|rmb1: We can't tell if @HK is a key card,|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i hope you are back to home from office :)|pg||
pc|s9|nt|copeyj: if 3@h showed 5+@S (as is fairly likely) then 4N is either 6 keycard bwood or keycard for @S imo|pg||
nt|jallerton: was South close to a double of 3NT?|pg||
nt|paulg:  opposite a non-vulnerable Fredin overcall? Probably not.|pg||
nt|jallerton: he has all the suits stopped and can even supply a spade honour if partner leads his suit|pg||
nt|eweber: and an unlucky lead|pg||
nt|hawe45:  And a @D|pg||
pc|c8|nt|h_karluk: or just ask K and roll the dice - worst scenario|pg||
nt|copeyj: and judging by response id say just kc for @S|pg||
nt|haans: Fallenius are sitting asking "were is 2 down"|pg||
nt|jallerton: but I agree that his does depend on partner;s style of overcalls to an extent|pg||
pc|dT|nt|rmb1: East knows West can't have enough for grand, given limited 1@D opening|pg||
nt|copeyj: england in 7@S next door|pg||
nt|daman: -2   but they should make at least 3@S EW|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|h_karluk: let me visit and brb|pg||
nt|lestergold: we are not allowed to show any pleasure Simon at that foprtuitous result|pg||
nt|vasmar: not yet :(|pg||
nt|h_karluk: oh ok, time for a deep finesse in @d suit? :)|pg||
nt|toniemme: mariani maschera la Dama..|pg||
nt|rialc2: Carlo nasconde la Q di @D|pg||
nt|hedyg: disc a @H?|pg||
nt|andreasw:  thx to all has been great  and thx to our operater Thierry for doing a great Job bye everyone|pg||
nt|hedyg: bye Andi :)|pg||
pc|s6|nt|haans: boring|pg||
nt|rnmalik: such an action hand-one bid and over.|pg||
nt|toniemme: now low club for not easy defense..|pg||
nt|hedyg: he will not find it|pg||
nt|toniemme: 4@C 4@S 1ruf and 1@H|pg||
nt|hedyg: count to 10 and play small @c|pg||
nt|dimi: this will make |pg||
nt|daman: unless a trumps is led|pg||
pc|h7|pc|c3|nt|arvidsson: nu kan man göra storslam med rätt giss i hj :) |pg||

nt|mikael_w: visste väl att gissen var viktig :)|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|paulg:  also his redouble on the first board was not a roaring success|pg||
nt|affe82: operator: did EW really go down in 3@c on board..|pg||
nt|daman: even then they have a pitch on the @H Queen|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h9|pc|h2|pc|h6|pg||
pc|hA|pc|hT|nt|sfoxa:  that promotes 3rd trump trick for defence|pg||
pc|h4|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|xenya: will be over soon|pg||
nt|vasmar: no need for 5 since there is a discard|pg||
nt|daman: this could have been real ugly had he cashed the AK of @Hs before leading a @S lol|pg||
mc|5|nt|haans: 1@C 16+|pg||
nt|Gerben42: if you cash @SKQ you will have 4 tricks but give up any chance for a 5th|pg||

mb|1H|nt|rnmalik: indeed-vul 3@H means something and E passed 4@C with that hand.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: oh yes they are in 7|pg||
nt|copeyj: Jason Hackett bid 3@S over 1@S (a massive difference in hand evaluation because he was not in a limited system)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: undeserved technically but when you ar behind you need a little push and luck|pg||
nt|rnmalik: :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: well, that board would be a breakpoint|pg||
nt|nyg8:  that was my point - 11 tricks for EW....|pg||
nt|nyg8:  6S is makeable here|pg||
nt|nyg8:  if you guess the Clubs|pg||
mb|1S!|nt|h_karluk: walls have ears|pg||
nt|copeyj: and when justin asked about Ks, he heard 6@D which i believe was that K or the other two - so Justin knew at worst on a hook and could be solid|pg||
mb|2D|nt|haans: 3nt best|pg||
nt|lestergold: could have gone other way and meant an ignom,inous defeat such is bridge|pg||

nt|mikael_w: Där vi kan följa running scores står det också 37-29 så då stämmer det säkert|pg||
mb|4D|nt|andyv:  3N and 4@s make here|pg||
nt|h_karluk: in my book 7 means adventure|pg||
nt|paulg:  getting a flat board, going down in game when your team mates make part score, is always amusing when you score up|pg||
nt|haans: less that 11-13 raise (2@H)|pg||
nt|jallerton: 2@s = @s+@c?|pg||
nt|mamos: North has a huge hand for 10-12 NT |pg||
nt|rnmalik: coffee hand.|pg||
nt|nyg8:  3 card support|pg||
mb|4S|nt|mdgraham: England are hurting|pg||
nt|lestergold: regret that i must leave now thx to my excellent fellow commentators well played Denmark|pg||
nt|copeyj: 3@H splinter|pg||
nt|mdgraham: good news for West|pg||
nt|h_karluk: seems popular in nowadays|pg||
nt|nyg8:  he will make 6 with only 17 working points|pg||
mb|5D|nt|haans: all sweden happy|pg||
mb|d|nt|jfaria: Jan chooses the 8 card fit|pg||
nt|Gerben42: invitational jump shift|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: however this was a lucky day, who knows tomorrow|pg||
nt|haans: yes Gazzilli (in sweden we call it Hexan)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 3NT seems to have a shot though|pg||
nt|mdgraham: can't see EW doing any more bididng, but you never know|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: interesting decision to bid 4@S....presumably 3@S showed (at least) three |pg||
nt|vasmar: if he finds clubs he can get 10 tricks|pg||
nt|h_karluk: minor major in a single bid, in te rest ing|pg||
nt|jfaria: he can now|pg||
nt|haans: a Gazzilli variation |pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  seems odd that S would insist on @s game |pg||
nt|haans: 3nt would have been slam try|pg||
nt|xenya: quite a helpful lead...|pg||
nt|haans: usually no singel but slammish|pg||
nt|arvidsson: jag tror på hemgång fortfarande|pg||
nt|arvidsson: denna bricka kommer gå bet|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, they have.|pg||
nt|nyg8:  i would not pass that....|pg||
nt|nyg8:  3 lights|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|dimi: not the best lead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South has quite a good case to pull the double|pg||
pc|h2|nt|andyv:  can't believe 3@s showed 3... S is never allowed to get out in 3@s?|pg||
nt|haans: (Häxan = Witsch)|pg||
pc|dT|nt|haans: now they can play nt|pg||
nt|haans: true|pg||
nt|rnmalik: with this bid yes, 6@H maked on Double @D finesse for EW. 5@H always there.|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|mdgraham: sorry, I must leave too - I have a bridge match|pg||
nt|arvidsson: om försvaret hittar att angripa hj|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but 5@D looks a bit wild|pg||
nt|nyg8:  sK and then C swithc|pg||
pc|sK|nt|rodvenn: so Iceland got to Lightner double 6! played from West. 1 down|pg||
nt|pauleger: @c lead would have been best|pg||
nt|mdgraham: thanks Simon, thanks operator - and well done to Denmark|pg||
pc|s7|nt|haans: @CJ right|pg||
nt|andersk: and Norway stoped in 5@S on the next slam, as we predicted|pg||
nt|rodvenn: this is a funeral|pg||
nt|rodvenn: of course also very well done by Iceland!|pg||
nt|andersk: we still miss board 13 here|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mdgraham: agree, seems unlikely |pg||
nt|rnmalik: makes|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|andyv:  almost looks like one round of bidding is missing|pg||
nt|copeyj: townsend trying for 13 tricks|pg||
pc|c4|nt|haans: my kind a play|pg||
pc|cK|nt|mdgraham: maybe South bid 3NT and North corrected?|pg||
nt|rmb1: England regain the lead|pg||
nt|mamos: just one off|pg||
pc|cA|nt|haans: well done|pg||
nt|h_karluk: slam and grandslam difference|pg||
nt|lestergold: edge intom it rather than leap|pg||
nt|copeyj: but dont think he can|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes|pg||
nt|pauleger: this will make with @sK onside|pg||
pc|c8|nt|andyv:  that would seem to be normal|pg||
nt|haans: now thay have a little talk|pg||
pc|cT|nt|pelu: no: 3@S by N = 3+ @S - System note 14 :):))|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Our matches in round 2 (all from the open series in 1 hour and 35 minutes) are: Italy v Turkey, Norway v Croatia, Sweden v Denmark, Netherlands v Spain, and Portugal v Poland|pg||
nt|andyv:  specs educating me... one states that 3@d may show a weak 5+ in major or other strong hand and 3@h or 3@s is the other major forcing to game.... interesting treatment.|pg||
nt|rodvenn: i think thw way Iclenad bid to 4@s on board 11 was impressive|pg||
nt|rodvenn: the way Iceland bid|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Thierry, the way the game goes on "Movie" its imposible 4 @c was down 1? Was there a wrong claim or something ?|pg||

nt|hawe45:  But a friendly lead|pg||

pc|d4|nt|Gerben42: easy contract|pg||
nt|rnmalik: next please.|pg||
pc|dT|nt|rnmalik: A reasonable game.|pg||
nt|mikael_w: puuuhhhh|pg||
nt|hawe45:  North will be saved by his partners @S 8|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But 4 x @C now might work|pg||
pc|d9|nt|pauleger: an easy make (hopefully this time)|pg||

pc|sT|pc|sK|nt|jfaria: im told 2@d= 11-14 5-5 8-14 5-4 |pg||
nt|jfaria: hard to W to guess...|pg||
nt|vasmar: he has 4 good cards in majors|pg||
nt|vasmar: but he is afraid of many minor losers|pg||
nt|jfaria: those calls are ackward to meet when weak and get strong fit, otherwise a very big gap to to fill|pg||
nt|paulg:  it seems random to me with no outside entry, even if his minor values are soft|pg||
nt|haans: Time tomorrow: 10.30 13.30 central time|pg||
nt|paulg:  As I said at the start, this result will count in the second round robin as well as teams only play the qualifiers from the other group|pg||
nt|jallerton: Why can't they start at the same time each day?|pg||
nt|haans: 9.30 am 12.30 pm your time|pg||

pc|s6|nt|jallerton: "your" = UK/Portugal/Canaries|pg||

pc|s4|nt|hawe45:  Now the only suit declarer has NOT played, was the one he SHOULD play|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|lestergold: ?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: now East has to find @HQ, and I can'; |pg||
nt|mdgraham: 't see any reason why he should|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|rodvenn: desperate but correct|pg||
nt|hawe45:  One more gift now, letÂ´s see|pg||
pc|h2|pc|s5|nt|eweber: South plays the 4th club after coming in whith the 1st round of trumps, of course|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
pc|c3|nt|vasmar: since there is a ruffing finesse position in diamonds 6 are cold|pg||
pc|c5|nt|jfaria: in open Brink choose a light 4@s in first position in board 18. not a double game swing but NS were forced to 6@c -1|pg||

mb|p|nt|haans: bye Vladimir|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: bye Hans, thanks|pg||
nt|xenya: another 3N for NS|pg||

nt|copeyj: boring 1N deal it looks like|pg||
nt|vasmar: 11 tricks?|pg||
nt|jfaria: again Majors ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: yes because of the spades|pg||
nt|mamos: meanwhile NS judged well on Board 18|pg||
mb|2C|nt|copeyj: 2@H here|pg||
mb|2S|nt|xenya: might be a delicate contract though|pg||
nt|copeyj: i guess|pg||
nt|mamos: ew will bid game i think|pg||
nt|eweber: right, I am wondering whether their strong club system made things difficult or possible here...|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Interesting hand.|pg||
mb|p|nt|dimi: a lot of distribution around but no game seems to be available|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: 2!GH 3 card support 11-13|pg||
nt|vasmar: if you play anti flannery you must get these hands usually :) |pg||
mb|d|nt|hawe45:  @S 9 - and it is over|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodvenn: 3 nt is a natural contract which will make|pg||
nt|lestergold: difficult hands to bid n/s|pg||
nt|copeyj: altho townsend may double 2@H for t/o|pg||
nt|copeyj: but hasnt|pg||
nt|copeyj: too much of his hand in @H|pg||
nt|vasmar: trump lead|pg||
nt|h_karluk: guys that's antiflannery, 1st time saw around 1987 in some Brasil international team, the next year was popular amongst many Europeans but quickly disappeared, now back again|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Difficult lead for North|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North may contest this - 2NT?|pg||
nt|nyg8:  X is dangerous with onl 2H|pg||
mb|3H|nt|xenya: hmm...|pg||
nt|lestergold: Gold has decided to get out of this misfit auction early|pg||
nt|lestergold: shouldbe able to scramble 8 tricks here|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i guess the twins like to toll the dice|pg||
nt|lestergold: a PLUS SCORTE ON THESE CARDS WOULD BE VERY GOOD FOR N/S|pg||
nt|h_karluk: *roll|pg||
nt|paulg:  when I see that they play in 4@h in the other room, i presume someone passed Redwood (keycard in diamonds)|pg||
nt|jallerton: Burn's Law violation in other room|pg||
nt|haans: better contract|pg||
nt|haans: no E did make a take out|pg||
nt|haans: W took out|pg||
nt|jillan:  The bidding was "slighty" different. South opened  1S and North bid 2S.. |pg||
nt|paulg:  Looks like the Hacketts created most of the trouble by opening the South hand|pg||
nt|jallerton: In fact 6@d is where you want to be - not easy|pg||
mb|3S|nt|pauleger: this wont make|pg||
nt|lestergold: caps lock by mistake sorry|pg||
nt|haans: believe 3@C was GF|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Jag antar att 1 @h visar @s, så nu behöver inte Cullin oroa sig för den färgen längre|pg||
nt|koksoy: as diamonds are favoritly  divided 10 tricks  can  be  taken  in  spade contract|pg||
nt|nyg8:  i would have bid 2N to shows 6-4 in minirs|pg||
mb|4C|nt|andyv:  lead helpful to declarer|pg||
nt|mikael_w: nu gäller det att dom vet vad som händer så att inte Uppmark tar detta som starkt och bra stöd i @c|pg||
nt|mikael_w: men dom har säkert bra ordning på sådant, men man blir ju alltid lite orolig|pg||
nt|affe82: 5@d är väl vad som kan försökas. men det blir väl tungt med trumf fran försvaret ngn gang.|pg||
nt|mikael_w: ja, jag tror man skall vara glad om man går hem i delkontrakt i @d här|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: double|pg||
nt|mdgraham: by West|pg||
nt|nyg8:  S will bid 4D now|pg||
nt|nyg8:  giving N an option with only 2H|pg||
nt|mdgraham: can South infer that North has diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: no worries, its fine|pg||
nt|mamos: i think South needs to lead Hearts |pg||
nt|mamos: after cashing will do|pg||
nt|mamos: if not North will be endplayed |pg||
nt|mikael_w: ajajaj|pg||
nt|affe82: vi kan enas om att det fanns 3 andra trumffärger som var bättre iaf.|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: perhaps N expected to find S with xx xxx xx xxxxxx|pg||
nt|jallerton: Mari-Volcker(France) and Stockdale/Brown (Eng ladies) made 6@d I hear|pg||
nt|mikael_w: det var just detta jag syftade på, men det ÄR jobbigt när fi bjuder hela tiden|pg||
nt|rnmalik: can make 4 with a chance to play @D thrice and entry retained in dummy.|pg||
nt|koksoy: ým  sure   he  would  play  on  diamods  if  he had  played  4|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West content|pg||
pc|s4|nt|rodvenn: prabably with overtricks|pg||
nt|rnmalik: had 9 top tricks and with @D lead 10.|pg||
nt|haans: sweden have increased there lead|pg||
nt|Gerben42: its very close though, for example @CA onside would suffice|pg||
nt|dimi: 3@hs and a @s trick as a minimum|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Gerben42: 4-0 break of course not helpful|pg||
nt|mikael_w: och det skall det vara|pg||
pc|s5|nt|jallerton: Perhaps 4@s is Flint here, trying to sign off somewhere|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|jfaria: now Fuck can ruff some @h|pg||
nt|jallerton: 4@d|pg||
nt|haans: holy ...|pg||
nt|affe82: men @d ut erbjuder möjligheten att lata syd stjäla ett gäng höga ruter.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|h_karluk: Fucik worked for that|pg||
pc|c3|nt|paulg:  hard to know what range East has actually shown |pg||
nt|jallerton: they were not many IMPs at stake anyway, Hans assuming EW made a plus score|pg||
pc|h2|nt|affe82: gar nog nagon bet här.|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|haans: nice knowing who has the king|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|andyv:  really?|pg||
pc|c8|nt|vasmar: Purka yo mean|pg||
pc|d2|nt|jallerton: I suspect West was just signing off in 5@d, Paul|pg||
nt|haans: 2nd opinion: pauleGER: not "well done" ? ME: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO|pg||
nt|mamos: still ok if plays Heart when in with Club|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Jag misstänker att Cullin var orolig för att bli bortpsykad här. och Uppmark földe regeln att med missanpassning så gäller dett stanna så lågt som möjligt|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|h_karluk: you are a regular commentator and we are sure that a nice personality there :)|pg||

nt|jfaria: Fucik i meant|pg||
pc|s6|nt|h_karluk: true Gunther is declarer|pg||
nt|dimi: but will be 2 down eventually|pg||
nt|hawe45:  My grandmother would have defeated this 4 @H - by taking her minir-aces...|pg||
nt|hawe45:  minor-|pg||
pc|c5|nt|lestergold: oh dear Towsened has abandoned 2 clubs and the enry form a spade finesse|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I must admit the double of 2@S sounded more like a 1336 shape or similar, rather than 1246   |pg||
pc|s3|nt|pauleger: -2|pg||
nt|vasmar: he will make easily 9 tricks|pg||
nt|mamos: now|pg||

nt|Gerben42: 6@H is a nice contract, can even find @HK after overcall|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: Didn't the defence have 2 trumps for the last three tricks?  Declarer claiming 2 tricks was unlikely|pg||
nt|h_karluk: oh ACOL|pg||
nt|lestergold: the last few tricks looked strange like why would towsend not play the third spade rather than the heart|pg||
nt|Gerben42: must have been 2NT opening?|pg||
pc|cA|nt|pauleger: Auken - von Arnim played only 2@h on this board|pg||
nt|mamos: East had a  horrid position   - played South for Kx  which in a way was consistent with her defence  dont know what 1@H from North meant|pg||
nt|mamos: sorry qx|pg||
nt|pitiful:  probably expected south to have more than 10points for 2N|pg||

pc|c2|nt|h_karluk: 22/18|pg||
nt|jallerton: Thanks also to my co-commentators: Hans, Paul and Ben|pg||
nt|eweber: though she might have expected North to have something for her 1@h bid|pg||
nt|mamos: these handa re glaringly obvious for us .......... but declarer has a different view :)|pg||
nt|eweber: they are playing very quickly, maybe too quick this time|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|pitiful:  n-s have a @s partcore here|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 1NT would be 14-16|pg||
nt|dimi: 6@s could be a cheap defense|pg||
nt|Gerben42: strange |pg||
nt|Gerben42: but found the top spot anyway|pg||

nt|rnmalik: Board 17 may result in double swing for Sweden.|pg||

nt|vugraphzns: tanks to watch|pg||
nt|eweber: I assume she relied on the fact that Dany never played a @h through|pg||

pc|cT|nt|h_karluk: last 5 tricks|pg||
nt|h_karluk: opps had 3 tricks|pg||

nt|h_karluk: this only possible very fast players there, also in a long marathon operators got tired|pg||
nt|lestergold: a savage misfit in the side suits and a nasty spade layout|pg||
nt|vugraphzns: yes|pg||
nt|rmb1: Me (and some spec.s - thanks) think defence took 2@H and 4@D|pg||
