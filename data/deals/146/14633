nt|brolucius: I wonder if South's pass of 1@C will eventually allow declarer to drop the @SK offside.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: hello Peter, Gerben, Ugis and Barnet|pg||
nt|ugis: Latvians playing Precision here and Polish club in the other room|pg||
nt|petergill: An untidy contract to reach|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 2@C must have been some art. rebid|pg||

nt|hedyg: hi guys :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hi andy, spectators|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Bas|pg||
mb|2S|nt|paulg:  Wilkinson-Piper play a fairly standard version of Precision, in a typically aggressive style|pg||
nt|hedyg: the official website is : http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/10Ostend/Information.htm|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hello everyone|pg||

nt|barnets: hi all|pg||
nt|ugis: yes, 2c artificial here|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Welcome Barnet :)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: so looks like a Burn's law violation|pg||
nt|Gerben42: (opps have more trumps than declarer)|pg||
nt|petergill: NS Convention Card is http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/May/OpenTeams/latvia/Ozols-Romanovskis.pdf|pg||
nt|Gerben42: probably not much lost as natural bidders would reach 3@C, which has problems on this trump break|pg||
mb|3D|an|W: 6-5|nt|andyv:  dbl here by W should deny 4 spades. so E might be better to bid the @d suit|pg||
nt|xenya: and Martin |pg||
nt|bagman: Here NS are lucky to make 4@H|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Hey Mike, Shirley :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: canape sequesnce it seems |pg||
nt|mamos: yes ew stong club canape |pg||
nt|mamos: english pair 4 card majors natural style|pg||
nt|iain sime: Hi everyone. Both pairs are using fairly natural methods. For Italy 2@Dis strong, for the Swiss it is a weak 2.|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: As is Ostend :) Hey Iain|pg||
nt|hedyg: Polish @c for EW|pg||
nt|gulyas: a win here may still help them get in the top9|pg||
nt|athene: standard for NS|pg||
nt|athene: (strong and 5)|pg||
nt|gulyas: EW plays polish club|pg||
nt|bagman: Looks like strong club opening and two suited 2NT or misunderstanding|pg||
nt|koksoy: it  may be  lead directing purpose..|pg||
nt|schtsch: tesla stanicic are not in good shape on this tournament, but now is the time to correct it|pg||
nt|frululu: good result for Croatia in open room|pg||
nt|schtsch: well, we need 25 in this match to have a chance :)|pg||
nt|corplaw: EW can make 4H so possible double game swing available|pg||
nt|schtsch: so this is necessary|pg||
nt|frululu: and Latvia,Hungary and Wales need to be hitted by a bus :P|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|othered1: Slightly pushy game, but preempt improves it.|pg||
nt|ziff:  I met him a couple of years ago at an EBL TD course|pg||
mb|5D|nt|kiwi_joker: Madala in a comon position for us all .. not want to sell out to 2@S|pg||

nt|bagman: or actually 5@H|pg||
nt|lesniak: witam wszystkich|pg||
nt|ugis: 2h showed h+c, min, S has forgotten the system :)|pg||
nt|athene: both pairs upside down carding|pg||
nt|petergill: A quiet hand to start|pg||
mb|p!|nt|bjacobs: This will be a stern test for Lithuania ... no joy on board 1, although 4@H is a fairly normal contract|pg||
nt|sybarra: everything off side here,  |pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: @Hs rightsided|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Hey all, welcome back :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hello Pekka and Ben|pg||
nt|bagman: North has a very unfitting hand for South. 3NT might have made but the bad diamond break probably kills even that|pg||
nt|pasker: Hi everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and Andy|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Heya Ben|pg||
nt|brolucius: The 2@C overcall has helped them to stop low on good values.|pg||
nt|iain sime: Even hot in Edinburgh!|pg||

mb|d|nt|atabey: even w/o preemt normal to reach|pg||
nt|fabsayc: a fair bit of upgrading, this should make|pg||
nt|bagman: North would like to cash a spade and return a trump|pg||
nt|andyv:  some work to do here|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  should be an easy down 2|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 9 tricks in @S for EW because of good @S and @D splits, I think|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Bas:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  but 4th @d should allow declarer to pitch a @s|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwi_joker: yes, but not a contract that was ever likley to be doubled|pg||
nt|andyv:  1st board partials tend to get away with murder... no one is ready to commit 11 or more imps:)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Italians must play that 3@D is weaker than a pass on the East cards.|pg||
nt|mamos: The English pair very experienced of course  - winners in Worls Seniors|pg||
nt|sybarra: nice lead to take the entry out of dummy fast |pg||
nt|barnets: e/w do quite well in diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: played by S. it goes down on a @D lead|pg||

nt|lesniak: liczymy na lepszy wystep naszych|pg||
nt|bagman: Without X, this might be relatively cheap|pg||
nt|andyv:  the Italians are so good, they merely sent East and West to play for them.|pg||

pc|c4|nt|henryb:  It looks like declarer should take 2@s, 1@h, and two in each minor|pg||
nt|paulg:  Wilkinson-Piper also play very fast, so this should be a quick set|pg||
pc|cK|nt|brolucius: 3@C would have made life a bit more difficult for West.|pg||
nt|hedyg: S needed 6+ hcps to bid over 1@c|pg||
nt|bagman: If E gets into the elimination position he can afford to finesse in spades to endplay N;|pg||
nt|hedyg: hard to read 9@c lead|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/10Ostend/Ostend|pg||
nt|bjacobs: In fact, 6@C on this layout will make on a heart lead!|pg||

mb|p|nt|kiwi_joker: If he had enough entries, he could lead spades from dummy 3 times for a very positive outcome (West covering first two times) .....|pg||
nt|andyv:  the 4 of @s just too big a card to overcome|pg||
nt|barnets: well done|pg||
nt|koksoy: as diamonds are 2-2  contract  depends on  heart guess|pg||
nt|petergill: Sorry we cannot explain what the bids mean|pg||
nt|ziff:  Versace will surely try for slam, but the 5-level should be safe, as a @D ruff is with the natural trump trick|pg||

nt|petergill: The play of 3@DX corrected to 3@HX is hard to analyse, if South went for blood|pg||
nt|schtsch: ah 3@c is some sort of relay it seems|pg||
pc|hT|nt|xenya: good stop, good lead|pg||
nt|bagman: E has soft values but he has so much of them that he has to at least invite|pg||
nt|brolucius: A recent book recommended a 5-4-3-2-1 point count (5 for aces, 1 for tens) when responding to 1NT. That would upgrade the value of the East hand.|pg||
nt|hedyg: no they dont open 1NT with 5 card majors|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I can't hear what they're saying exactly, but it's not Puppet I believe|pg||
nt|hedyg: i think 2@d denies 3 + cards in @H|pg||
nt|bagman: West has a good hand: aces and kings and the only Q in the suit where it surely works|pg||
nt|antoniz: kontra w 2pik powinna pokazywaæ lepsz¹ rêkê,moim zdaniem|pg||
nt|gulyas: EW lead 2nd/4th|pg||
nt|athene: can't see declarer finessing the six of trumps so this will lose two clubs, three trumps...maybe he will finesse spades too for a heart pitch|pg||
nt|athene: unless east gets endplayed somehow|pg||
nt|wstuart: probably shows any min?|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mamos: NS play 4 card majors|pg||
nt|marlowepi: presumably will rise and play a spade|pg||
nt|hedyg: or he will ruff out Q@s maybe?|pg||
nt|andyv:  should make this|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|jtr: Looks like 9 tricks or so with the lie of the cards|pg||
nt|atabey: zorlu will have to guess @hs|pg||
nt|othered1: Personally, I'm not big on semi-psychic openings and would prefer to have some defense if I open.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Or "can" make|pg||
nt|mbruun: Good save by the Italians. East unstopable after the thin overcall|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Anyway, 5@S doubled is a pretty normal outcome|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Esp with @S, the Italians like to come in at the 1 level|pg||
nt|mdgraham: EW basically natural with a srong NT. NS play the NASZ system|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i predict down one|pg||
nt|corplaw: 4H could be down if declarer misguesses everything and def gives no help|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jtr: However, 8 might not be so easy:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: but nothing in their CC|pg||
nt|bagman: About 25 yars later it has been resurrected|pg||
nt|lesniak: oczywiscie jego istotnoæ polega na tym ,¿e wynik tego meczu bedzie sie liczy w finale|pg||
nt|bagman: The heart guess is getting no easier|pg||
nt|bagman: because S needs @HA for his opening more or less|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|athene: finesse must be better odds surely|pg||
nt|hedyg: a 3rd seat minor preempt is not necessarily weak|pg||
nt|athene: trump switch now would not help the defence, of course|pg||
nt|ziff:  I suspect 2@C was an artificial gameforce, 2@D may be balanced or nor @H support|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@C likely a general GF, perhaps 2@D = not three hearts. Just guessing though|pg||
nt|petergill: EW quickly established that slam was poor. The 2@D response to 2@C looks like it showed a minimum hand |pg||
nt|ziff:  Great minds all think alike ;)|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@C asked, 2@D = not 3@H, 2@S GF natural, 2NT minimum balanced, 4@S = end|pg||
nt|petergill: from my Italian source|pg||
pc|h4|nt|koksoy: ým  sure D uboin will decide good after @S A @SD in N hand|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|sybarra: bid 1 looks like severe punishment |pg||
nt|hedyg: so he either has 4@ss or no major|pg||
nt|petergill: The bidding makes picking the @D's fairly easy|pg||
nt|andyv:  don't see how... 5@hs, 2@s and at least 1@c|pg||
nt|schtsch: don't think 3@c can be minimum|pg||
nt|schtsch: how do they play 3@h then?|pg||
nt|schtsch: 3@h is obviously minimum, 3@c some relayish|pg||
nt|ahri: 3@c could ask which option it is if 2NT is what Bas suggests. I'll take a peek in their CC.|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|Walddk2: Good morning to David Bird|pg||
nt|brolucius: Hi to the kibitzers!|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: Heya David B :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: The proposed new point-count system had two big flaws, as I see it. (1) No-one wants to have a 60-point deck and to need 34 points to open 2@C. Too difficult to count that high. ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: Also, you don;t know whether you will end in NT during the early bidding, so impractical to upgrade the Q/Js, which will have less value in an eventual suit contract.  |pg||
nt|bogier: E zorientowa³ siê z ogólnego przebiegu licytacji, ¿e wejcie partnera(chyba brata?) by³o s³absze i wyhamowa³|pg||

nt|sybarra: little frisky agst the Italians in the other room maybe|pg||
nt|athene: that's interesting shot - playing his partner for the ace of spades, hoping for @SA and another, and now declarer would duck, fearing the switch was a singleton|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 3@h shows a stiff @D|pg||
pc|d5|nt|jtr: GM DB9|pg||
nt|bagman: The ruff wil come with trump trick and the club can be later discarded on the diamond|pg||

nt|mdgraham: well, 4@H was mildly unlucky|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I like the 2@C overcall, but West's raise to 3@C was more dubious.  Whatever, the Italians had booked a gain by stopping in a partscore|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but there is a question of whether 2@H in the actual sequence is (a) sign-off (b) invitational (c) forcing|pg||
nt|barnets: it would certainly have been more interesting to watch peter|pg||
nt|Gerben42: not so clear at this vuln to prefer defending|pg||
pc|s3|nt|bagman: Assuming that declarer guesses the spade layout|pg||
nt|bagman: Which he really should even with the restricted choice|pg||
pc|s7|nt|jtr: problems|pg||
nt|marlowepi: dont understand the second trump, but maybe i am not awake yet|pg||
nt|wstuart: Somewhat pointless to guess at their methods.|pg||
pc|s8|nt|marlowepi: had trumps been 4-1 the second heart would have ben fatal, but there would have been chances by leading a spade|pg||
nt|brolucius: Possible intra-finesse in clubs.|pg||
nt|gulyas: it was not a bad idea, it was just wrong here|pg||
nt|athene: ok, one down|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer is likely to draw trumps now|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Most would play (a) ... but North might raise anyway.  The 4@H bid seemed to be "a lot"|pg||
pc|h3|nt|brolucius: Yes, some ******* has stolen my address book and is sending adverts that seem to come from me.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: for example, you can play 2@H as invitational and 2@C as a puppet to 2@d, so that 2@H is then pass/correct |pg||
nt|marlowepi: probably N judged that if trumps were 4-1 E would not have led a singleton|pg||

nt|koksoy: by  this  way , he can afford to  loose  2 hearts and a spade|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|iceblue: 3@H ¸ãÏÞÆÆÌ×|pg||
nt|brolucius: With hearts not being 3-2, he seems to be a trick short.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's quite a charming translation|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 1 up with the @H finesse?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: But cashing out is probably better in Teams|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|marlowepi: doesnt even need it as cards lie. could just cash winners and exit in clubs|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|pasker: Declarer likely to play for trumps 2-2 as has an extra chance if 3-1 of setting up @Ds for a 2nd @C pitch|pg||
nt|bagman: He should have gone up the @SA to have late entry to hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  E has easy exits|pg||
pc|d4|nt|daman: this will be over quickly|pg||
nt|gulyas: hmm, interesting play here|pg||
nt|athene: @S10 and declarer will throw @D perhaps|pg||
nt|gulyas: could be|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Hey George btw, and thanks :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Anyway, declarer will play the overcaller for the @HA.|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: True, but the @H finesse is more elegant :)|pg||
nt|athene: you normally hope that an early ruff is from the trump length|pg||
nt|athene: when it isn't, there can be problems|pg||
pc|s9|nt|Vugraphznk: N had the slightest of pauses before playing @DQ|pg||
nt|sybarra: may just play the !'s right now|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Here's another: For all the auctions bilateral spikes own color in a highly ³ ¶ you three and four are based on the fit ± colored partner (9 cards in the colors of bids) |pg||
nt|Walddk2: lol|pg||
nt|Walddk2: spikes|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: lol|pg||
nt|bjacobs: well, it's not exactly "full disclosure"|pg||
nt|sybarra: sounds like a volley ball game description |pg||
nt|bjacobs: Duboin really has a serious problem here - if that queen is singleton, which the odds suggest, he needs to cross to dummy to finesse diamonds|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I think I'll settle for the ECATS system document: available from http://www.ecatsbridge.com/Events/ebl/2010ostend/default.asp|pg||
nt|bjacobs: As it turns out, even if he does that, he will make, because then the 3-3 club break is revealed|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not every day i see someone say "the finesse is the more elegant line of play"|pg||
pc|sT|nt|othered1: Again, open room reached the same contract after a different auction.   Good efforts to stop at 2|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So I think he might indeed take the club finesse now|pg||
nt|gulyas: @H now|pg||
nt|athene: apart from anything east may now be endplayed|pg||
nt|athene: of course we can see he isn't :)|pg||
nt|gulyas: true|pg||
nt|athene: when he switches to a heart, will declarer decide the @HK is wrong, and try to ruff it down?|pg||
nt|athene: ok, maybe he is considering a trump|pg||
nt|hedyg: when declarer refuses to play trump.........|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer can ruff the 4th club in dummy now|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|hedyg: @c ruff, draw trumps and run 9@H worked|pg||
nt|athene: with the spades wide open declarer can't get cute|pg||
nt|paulg:  he knows Piper has three or four hearts, and Wilkinson would not double with a singleton|pg||
nt|lesniak: oczywiscie Adam grajac 3 karo stara sie grac tylko najbezpieczniej jak mozna|pg||
nt|snetram:  w kara wychodzi tylko 10 lew - good stop by B-Å»|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|brolucius: West ruffed one of dummy's top hearts (on Board 1). Declarer had only one discard on the 13th heart - for his losing club - and could not afford to ruff the diamond loser with ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: dummy's bare @SK because West would then score the @SQ.|pg||
nt|Gerben42: first blood to Latvia - Italy in 4@S|pg||
nt|Gerben42: on  2|pg||
nt|petergill: Latvia is coming 7th. The top 9 teams in each group qualify for the next stage. |pg||
nt|schtsch: there is an endplay on w|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: just cash your winners|pg||
nt|andyv:  good point Pekka|pg||
nt|barnets: if the @DA was true then west has the @CAK|pg||
nt|petergill: Switch @SK and @SA - then 4@S is a reasonable contract|pg||
nt|ahri: west will be endplayed now with heart i suppose|pg||
pc|d2|nt|atabey: played wisely. could be complications if trumps were 4-2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Oh well|pg||
nt|gulyas: maybe he should have ducked this|pg||
pc|d3|nt|Walddk2: You can't help feeling sorry for declarer|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|brolucius: I expect we will hear what happened somehow...|pg||
nt|athene: ok|pg||
nt|athene: wow|pg||
nt|daman: ugh|pg||
nt|athene: he really finessed that?|pg||
nt|daman: had to be an undo|pg||
nt|capercliff: 4 more imps on 2 when Scotland sacrificed with 5@h|pg||
nt|andyv:  k@d for the gallery:)|pg||
nt|koksoy: at  board 2 Wales are one level higher than Italians so 4 imps to  Ýtaly|pg||
pc|h7|nt|brolucius: Some players use 2@S and 2NT to differentiate between a 3-card and 4-card heart raise. That would help declarer on this deal because he could then visualize two possible trump ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: losers.|pg||
pc|h8|nt|gulyas: :)|pg||
pc|d6|nt|hedyg: yes avoiding a trump promotion on a different setup|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|athene: ok :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: well there you go for elegance sake|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|corplaw: W needed to play third spade before clearing hearts|pg||
pc|cA|nt|sybarra: so bridge is an easy game (sometimes) |pg||

nt|Walddk2: I think it's a terrible Michaels vulnerable|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Shirley, one of the very top players in my area agrees with you.  He thinks the only excuse for not coming in with a 5-5 is that you are dead|pg||

nt|jbgood: the setting trick would /might have come in clubs....|pg||

mb|p|nt|bjacobs: well, it's only mild ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 500 point save in 5@S|pg||
nt|bagman: NS have started by bidding quite aggressively. It's a reasonable strategy when being an underdog|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@C Precision|pg||
nt|snetram:  Holandia, Austria i Anglia|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|daman: bidding 3@H would be aiming at a very small target|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D alerted because it promises some values|pg||
nt|athene: (2nt would be rubbish)|pg||
nt|daman: he might try 3@H now|pg||
nt|athene: i think east should just pass|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not really worth it|pg||
nt|brolucius: Had West made a weak jump overcall of 2@S and the opponents then settled in 6@C, declarer might play East for the @HA.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Perhaps Slovakians were up all night celebrating.|pg||
nt|bagman: North has some options: 2@D, 2NT, 3@C and 3NT|pg||

mb|p|nt|brolucius: If you press the MOVIE button, you can see the entire scorecard and play through any of the deals at the other table.|pg||
nt|ugis: 1d looked strange :)|pg||
nt|babs59: yes - last hand's 5@D bid was only 1 trick stronger really|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: Transfer response|pg||
nt|jtr: 1@h showing specifically three cards i imagine|pg||
nt|brolucius: West's 1@H rebid suggests three-card heart support.|pg||
nt|andyv:  5 imps to Lebanon on board 3 as they bid 5@hx|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Yesterday Hedy advocated rebidding 2@S as opposed to 1NT on a hand similar to the current W hand because of @Hxx :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  aggressive dbl by Bocchi has put S in a quandry|pg||
nt|andyv:  3@c will probably end it|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Interesting options for Madala here ..he has best hand at table...hasnt said a word yet :) |pg||
nt|andyv:  right... that's the quandry|pg||
nt|bjacobs: so you might as well go for it|pg||
nt|sybarra: I figure, one bid gets this hand off my chest  |pg||
nt|xenya: quite sensible though|pg||
nt|rodvenn: pushed|pg||
nt|rodvenn: we dont know who thinks. probably charlsen|pg||
nt|Walddk2: When fixed stay fixed. Madala thinking about raising I suppose. I don't Charlsen is thinking|pg||
nt|rodvenn: the BBO operator probably cant see on the other side of the screen|pg||
nt|jbgood: my press colleagues here think it is Charlsen who is thinking|pg||
nt|hedyg: Lohay wondering how much his K@D is worth|pg||
nt|bagman: Personally I would have taken the more aggressive 2NT approach|pg||
nt|brolucius: In the open room there was no spade overcall at all, I am told, and declarer guessed the @HA. |pg||
nt|sharkey: On previous hand In OR Madala entered dummy to play @H towards his hand - like he knew E had Ax... - one trump loser only|pg||
nt|brolucius: I don't like 3@C much on those values. 2@D or 2NT looks better. |pg||
nt|sharkey: after @D lead|pg||
nt|bagman: South has a good hand and can see 7 quick tricks|pg||
nt|sharkey: agree David - about as good as he can get|pg||

nt|schtsch: they have discussion on 50% of the borads|pg||
pc|hK|nt|andyv:  only problem with NT... no tricks|pg||
nt|andyv:  S will scramble for 7 tricks|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: 2NT is so seldom natural these days .. have we found a rare example?  :-)|pg||
nt|andyv:  Bocchi trying to decide|pg||
nt|andyv:  Q10 of @s makes him doubt that it's natural|pg||
nt|andyv:  but his minors are pretty sick|pg||
nt|andyv:  passing will probably push the board|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: several kibs think 2NT = scramble|pg||
nt|mbruun: Dbl of a Michaels could be treated as 7+ with 3c support. 2NT or 3H GF with 4c support, and if you have a penalty double just pass 2 Sp and wack them in the next roundat tti|pg||
nt|mdgraham: values? Well, all those fours must be worth something|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: *Tries not to laugh*|pg||
nt|sybarra: no chuckling at the table Bas |pg||
nt|bjacobs: I would pass as well, but the fact is that 5-5's can be quite powerful.  And the opponents don't always nail you, even when they should|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Looks like a playable method, Mathias|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The problem might be if partner intervenes before you get your chance to double|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Where did you nick it?|pg||
nt|mbruun: From Duboin-Sementa|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Another possibility is to double the 2@S bid saying: "partner, I am interested in penalties"|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That might stop partner from making a bid before you can get your claws on the next hand's bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: if only he could get to dummy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: By the way, 2@C shows diamonds as you may have guessed|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: It was Charlsen thinking, Madala had a swift pass|pg||
nt|sybarra: now for the cue bidding|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I count 16 tricks in any contract but @S EW :)|pg||
nt|gulyas: I am happy with the outcome as I am biased, but still surprised at the play|pg||
nt|athene: 6@S is there, but unlikely to be bid|pg||
nt|athene: oh sorry only 11 tricks|pg||
nt|athene: but surely they won't get higher than 4@S |pg||
nt|bagman: EW can make only 8 tricks in hearts|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@C FG 4+@C or balanced|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 2@D is nf with @D|pg||
pc|h6|nt|sharkey: 2@D would also leave more room for bidding|pg||
nt|bagman: Hoping that the cards lay well|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hi Vassilis, welcome|pg||
pc|h4|nt|brolucius: 2@D only shows a sound raise to 3@C, so North has plenty for that. Then he can raise to 3@C on distributional values and fewer points (to be obstructive).|pg||

pc|s8|nt|athene: east should just count himself thankful that his partner bid diamonds rather than clubs|pg||
nt|mbruun: 11 tricks now. Spade entry for the diamonds |pg||
nt|brolucius: Bocchi bid 2NT on the North cards at the other table. If you put your cursor over the Open Room result, top-left, you can see the other auction. |pg||
nt|marlowepi: our mathematicians in the audience can tell us what the odds are, when you have 2 six card suits, that five of the cards will be the same in the two suits|pg||
nt|marlowepi: they must make astronomical look small|pg||
nt|sybarra: praying for 2/2 @D after @H's dont break or is there another way?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: with 43 club break do not even need to guess Ds or have good luck there|pg||
nt|mamos: yes i was thinking about 4-3 as always its about combining chances|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4 discrads on black suit winners|pg||
nt|mamos: whats the best order|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes I see the club 4/3  maybe easier |pg||
nt|sybarra: I am told 7 sp only 2000, but they you push them to 7 nt most likely |pg||
pc|s4|nt|jtr: @h raises show five cards (obviously) and are limit bids|pg||
nt|brolucius: With only 4 hearts and a rubbish hand, East has to sign off in 1NT, 2@C or 2@H?|pg||
nt|jtr: Others play the 1@h rebid as any weak hand which i think is inferior|pg||
nt|jtr: Right|pg||
nt|jtr: Anyway, how is he doing in 4@h?|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: He has to decide if it's KTx or K9x or K8 onside|pg||
nt|jtr: Not as simple as that is it?|pg||
nt|brolucius: North held off his king to give declarer a guess if he held Q-J-9-x-x, but he has given West a chance to pick up the trumps for no loser now.|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: @C aren't splitting so he should ruff a @C in dummy?|pg||
nt|jtr: North did very well not to cover|pg||
nt|pasker: declarer likely to be at least down 2 here, 2@S 2@H, 1@D, 1@C|pg||
nt|marlowepi: have to play trump ace first in case they are 4-0. then king of H, club to ace and club ruff, heart to Q and club ruff, claim|pg||
nt|mamos: you dont want to go off trying to set up Club when Diamonds 2-2 alll the time |pg||
nt|schtsch: for handball of course|pg||
pc|s9|nt|tez: it was 8/10|pg||
nt|andyv:  even with fancy foot work in @s suit, there still are only 7 tricks|pg||
nt|hedyg: claim|pg||
nt|gulyas: Szalay, easily the best player of the team (and probably of Hungary, too, some may say) is a rare sitout|pg||
nt|athene: declarer will probably try to ruff hearts in dummy|pg||
nt|hedyg: i thought Dumbovich was the best on the team|pg||
nt|gulyas: he is expected to play the rest of the matches|pg||
nt|bagman: South might be worried about the result as some might open the N hand and reaching game is then easier|pg||

nt|hedyg: Lauria needs to disc the 8@c|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: A two-suited overcall would've been less likely with @SQ- I think|pg||

nt|Walddk2: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/Events/ebl/2010ostend/default.asp  for convention cards and other useful information|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Bocchi had shuffled, put his cards back in, taken a new board, placed the tray and board on the table and took out his cards before EW knew what had happened|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's not a record|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Obermair inquiring about the @D, laughter all around|pg||
nt|brolucius: Playing a two-level response as game-forcing has some advantages, of course. If it didn't, most of the USA wold not use it. But it is not that wonderful. Here, for example, East ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: did not want to cue-bid the @CA (because he wanted to limit his hand) but West was still unlimited.  |pg||
nt|barnets: another 6 imps to latvia when italy reached 4@S|pg||
nt|barnets: on the last|pg||
nt|gulyas: sure, some would say Dumbovich, or Winkler is better, its open to discussion:)|pg||

nt|hedyg: not this time..|pg||

nt|hedyg: tough decision|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Interesting: would you try for slam with the S hand opposite a strong 1NT?|pg||
nt|gulyas: but he WAS asked:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: :) of course he was!|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: The board has been put in the wrong way around...|pg||
nt|koksoy: double  difference & one overtrick  is 7 imps  for  Wales |pg||
nt|koksoy: at the  3rd board|pg||
nt|babs59: a reasonable shot by South tho|pg||
nt|petergill: After 16 rounds, EW, who play in all Italy's toughest matches and sat out matches like Slovakia, Latvia and Wales, are +0.46 imps/bd for 11 matches played |pg||
mb|1N|nt|hedyg: ty Roland :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphznk: In their defence, it was a really quick one|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 55 is|pg||
nt|brolucius: Perhaps Roland is the Great Dealer.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: some of the laughter may be about something else:)|pg||
nt|stc: 5@d was made because the def helped dec to eliminate @h@S, and dec guessed the @c position|pg||
nt|brolucius: In other words, it is difficult for both players to combine getting their strength across and cue-bidding their controls.|pg||
nt|gulyas: its a very nice hand|pg||
nt|athene: you have to be confident to bid 4@H with that south hands|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Or 4@D, if you play SA Texas, I guess :)|pg||
nt|athene: i remember lauria-versace had a misunderstanding in that position in the bermuda bowl|pg||
nt|babs59: and unfortunate that East gets horribly squeezed in 5@C|pg||
nt|babs59: on board 2 the Italians found the 5@C vulnerable save, but EW bid on to 5@S making|pg||
nt|andyv:  S still wondering what to do with her 2 headed monster|pg||
nt|mdgraham: anybody watching who is Welsh may not be too amused at that, Peter :) |pg||

nt|babs59: not what I'd have predicted|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Now I think of it, 4@H was a bit of a pot on the East hand - with an unhelpful void in partner's first-bid suit. Still, overbidding is not a fault at this level.|pg||
nt|hedyg: a drop of blood, Bas corrected the score|pg||
nt|hedyg: now, now, lets not go overboard !|pg||
nt|athene: well 4@D is ok because partner knows it's something cute so will probably just bid 4@H|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Just making I think|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer may reason that North was bound to lead a club or a diamond. His choice of a club may indicate that he holds the diamond ace, which makes a lead in that suit less ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: attractive.|pg||

nt|hedyg: so you all thought the 1@s opening bid was ok there?|pg||
nt|xenya: fireworks here|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is an example of Restricted Choice. If declarer had similar holdings in both the minors, he might have chosen to lead a diamond instead.|pg||

nt|marlowepi: first u have to bid it, then they have to lead a nonclub|pg||
nt|brolucius: The bidding on the last deal was instructive. When you compete for a part-score, responder should be very wary of undoing your good work by going too high.|pg||
nt|hedyg: not really if he counted N's hcps|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 1-point upgrade|pg||

nt|andyv:  mini splinter?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I must say, NS don't seem to be intimidated at all... Not letting EW play they usually do, ask to see claims, etc.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: On board 3, Bocchi-Madala discovered the club weakness, but they are uncomfortably high in 5@H. It also got a spade lead|pg||
nt|mamos: i hadnt even thought about if it was making just expected to bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: pretty likely that S had Q@c|pg||
nt|brolucius: Double (competitive) can mean clubs and spade tolerance (usually a doubleton).|pg||
nt|Gerben42: with this @H stopper you need @C for 0 loser|pg||
nt|petergill: East hand is worth 20.05 HCP, according to Kand R Evaluator at http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=aq2+k64+k6+ak986|pg||
nt|mdgraham: mildly unlucky lead, that diamond |pg||

mb|2N!|nt|jtr: 4@h failed on 4|pg||
nt|brolucius: Had Bocchi taken David's advice and cashed the second diamond winner, he would have made an overtrick.  |pg||
nt|jtr: I would usually defer to him:)|pg||
nt|brolucius: South scored a club overruff to defeat 4@H at the other table.|pg||
nt|tez: 2@d=good raise|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Adam Kaplan wrote a book on the "Tired RHO squeeze", applying here as well :)|pg||
nt|xenya: 5@D now -- can W or E bid 6 after that?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Madala would like to get doubled in a number of diamonds. Contemplating how to achieve that|pg||
nt|rodvenn: 6@dx = 3 down?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He has no defence against any contract by EW|pg||
nt|rodvenn: Hofta will go on to 6 and Madala will save i think. Not poosible to get minus 4 in practise|pg||
nt|sharkey: slam time|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@d=4+|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@H= negative freebid|pg||
nt|brolucius: Why not raise to 4@H?|pg||
nt|athene: EW do play a slightly strange form of Polish club|pg||

mb|p|nt|iceblue: NS play prec, EW 2over1|pg||

nt|andyv:  spec says 8-11 any singleton, 3@h asks and 3N shows @d singleton|pg||
nt|hedyg: Bas says Bocchi was told 2@H is strong so maybe it isnt a NFB|pg||
nt|iain sime: This has allowed South another chance.|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@S = minors |pg||
nt|barnets: but in fact they led a spade v 3N in other room from south dont ask me why|pg||
nt|schtsch: low heart lead in closed|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 2@d=@H|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2@S is what Kelsey used to describe as daisy-picking.|pg||
nt|athene: they play 4-card heart opener so the weak NT option in 1@C denies 4 hearts|pg||
nt|gulyas: sry, 15-17 with @Cs|pg||
nt|gulyas: an easy game here - some might try 6@C and succeed, but its not easy to bid|pg||

nt|brolucius: The defenders took their @DA and declarer broached trumps with low to the queen and king, followed by the overruff.|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: nice one|pg||
nt|andyv:  in OR, S overcalled 2@h and EW played 2@S|pg||
nt|andyv:  I had Adam sign it but he fell asleep|pg||
nt|xenya: how can Hofta bid 6 without  knowing about the @C support?|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: 2@D 2-way xyz?|pg||
nt|bagman: Italians are known to bid slams without 2 aces but I think that this generation uses RKCB as routine|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2way checkback, yes|pg||
nt|brolucius: The old 2-ace-missing system was so that opponents did at least have a chance of beating them.|pg||
nt|hedyg: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/May/OpenTeams/italy/duboin-sementa.pdf|pg||
nt|bagman: And indeed in Stockholm they did|pg||
nt|bagman: West is going to make a try|pg||
nt|Walddk2: As we see, 4@S can be defeated on best defence|pg||
nt|hedyg: over 2@d they bid up the line, i.e. with 4@Hs he would show those first|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Heart lead ruffed, diamond to the ace, heart ruff, and @SA|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, a heart is a plausible lead. It would stand out if West had actually bid hearts, since East has shown a balanced hand.|pg||
nt|sharkey: Even with a @C back goes down|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes S gets a 2nd chance to find the right return|pg||
nt|bagman: No, but N gets the ruff|pg||
nt|brolucius: If North is leading a heart, expecting it to be ruffed, he should lead a suit-preference card.|pg||
nt|bagman: On club return W probably tries to ditch the diamond|pg||
nt|hedyg: but N has no indication of 4 cards in @H in W|pg||
nt|brolucius: Learned kibitzers claim that it is OBVIOUS to play in no-trumps.|pg||
nt|sharkey: rite - so far W has only shown @S so not obvious to lead @H for ruff|pg||
nt|marlowepi: another cheesy takeout double, though at the colours fairly normal|pg||
nt|sybarra: remember these are seniors not juniors  |pg||
nt|hedyg: 10@s for free|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: This is possibly the longest I ever saw Duboin take to lead lol|pg||
nt|hedyg: he knows he is leading into a double stopper|pg||
nt|mdgraham: might reach 6@C here|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahri: for previous board, spec correctly pointed out that if spades are 2-1 you are safe as long as diamonds are 5-2 or 4-3 :). anyway, to this board...|pg||

nt|kiwi_joker: harfouche tries to make up for board 5. Sadly, this isnt the layout to do it|pg||
nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
nt|brolucius: 4@H would have bought it. Another instructive bidding hand.|pg||
nt|barnets: and so THEN the breaks are good and he will make it|pg||
nt|andyv:  with all the intermediates, do you think W has an invite with her 8 count, Barbara?|pg||
nt|babs59: I wouldn't|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 3-3 diamonds and the double club stop mean this won't take too long|pg||
nt|sybarra: do they play this as a puppet sequence.  looks like it |pg||
nt|bjacobs: Looks like it, in an unusual setting|pg||
nt|mdgraham: actually there was no guess in 6@D - two unavoidable losers at least |pg||
nt|bagman: N is likely to lead a heart whether W bids hearts or not; just for a different reason|pg||

mb|p|nt|jtr: Then a @d ruff for 2 down|pg||
nt|othered1: Was east's double simply negative or was it specific to @S?|pg||

nt|rodvenn: well bid by charlsen|pg||

nt|fabsayc: or rather bid in such a way as hard to judge if making|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes|pg||
nt|pasker: I think W may have been able to put Madala to a trump guess on that deal as @C weakness was marked|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Madala took all 13 by dropping @HQ, 11 IMPs to Italy|pg||
nt|bagman: EW like to sniff every possible slam. Sometimes that might give too much info for the defense|pg||

nt|capercliff: what else Hedy? pass?|pg||
nt|hedyg: that doesnt go as a 1@s opening bid in 1st seat vuln for me|pg||
nt|hedyg: too strong for a weak 2?|pg||
nt|capercliff: yes|pg||
nt|hedyg: you need a lot to make game, if pd cannot bid over a weak 2 i am not going anywhere|pg||
nt|capercliff: duck 2 @c and down 3|pg||

nt|Walddk2: It's a miracle that a diamond stands up after the support, and yet they can't beat it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So there is something wrong with Madala's judgement in my opinion|pg||
nt|hedyg: and also got the @c ruff|pg||
nt|Walddk2: David's point is valid. *IF* North thinks he can give partner5 a heart ruff on lead, he should also leader a high card in order to show preference for the higher suit, diamonds|pg||
nt|brolucius: South has shown big black two-suiter, so cannot hold all three hearts.|pg||

nt|iceblue: 2NT is nat fg, It is very puplar in china|pg||

nt|lesniak: w polsce nie stosuje sie odpowiedzi na Blackwooda pokazujace renons- szkoda|pg||
nt|bagman: 4@H makes now easily but generally this kind of contract can be quite delicate because of the misfit. It cannot stand bad breaks|pg||

nt|bagman: Declarer has quite safe 10 tricks by drawing trumps and giving away 2 clubs and a diamond|pg||
nt|Gerben42: @D ruff for 800|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: lol|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Nystrom showed his hand without a lead|pg||
nt|jkotor: 3@d = krótkoæ 8-10zz    zz: a=3, k=2, d=1|pg||
pc|d9|nt|xenya: here, at any rate, it has proved to be wrong |pg||
nt|bagman: Now N is interested to know if 3@H shows suit or just strength|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Otherwise South will not know if he should lead a club or a diamond|pg||
nt|marlowepi: best lead for NS. looks like a snoring hand, but the double increasing likelihood of bad breaks in key suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nothing you could have done if he had|pg||
nt|petergill: Normal contract at both tables, well bid, unlucky , assuming no @h lead|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mdgraham: 3@d/@H=transfers|pg||
nt|bjacobs: A simple approach is to just hope @HQ drops doubleton|pg||
nt|hedyg: hmm|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The point is moot now, so much for science|pg||
nt|hedyg: here N had the info and did not find the @H lead|pg||
nt|sharkey: Not their day - that was yesterday......|pg||
nt|athene: if north had a huge heart or diamond suit he might have bid it instead of 2@S perhaps|pg||
nt|snetram:  okazuje siÄ Å¼e sztucznie teÅ¼ moÅ¼na|pg||
nt|jkotor: mam dobre wpomaganie od Szwedów na priv|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: The lead wasn't really @SQ, there was no lead|pg||
nt|petergill: There is a silly double dummy line to make, which will not happen|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|sybarra: but with the 3 @S bid,  looks like puppet |pg||
nt|Walddk2: What do you think, do the players from the "lesser" nations enjoy playing against Italy or do they fear it, especially when they are on vugraph?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if I read it right|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Both|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I think both as well|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I saw a Serbian player take the match card with the countries and player names yesterday :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: there is a lot of pressure when you are on Vugraph |pg||
nt|mbruun: Possible push for Lithuania. Ceasefire|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Enormous pressure.  They would surely MUCH prefer to play the Italians in a small private room with no one watching|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: My first and only match on BBO was a disaster, it was against Belgium :(|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I would guess that they would be up for it. Lithuanians are a fiercely proud people |pg||
nt|bjacobs: This is a really complex position|pg||
nt|bjacobs: One possibility for Duboin is to ruff a club, then plan to discard a spade on the 4th club, then ruff a spade - finally the heart finesse|pg||
nt|bagman: he can discard one of the diamonds on the @SQ|pg||
nt|andyv:  E could see 10 tricks if @hs broke|pg||
nt|andyv:  now he has to decide how to tackle the @d and @c suits|pg||
nt|bagman: If trumps were 4-0, declarer needs some luck elsewhere|pg||
nt|bagman: He's safe to draw the last trump and establis a trick in clubs |pg||
nt|koksoy: he  may  try  ruffing 2  clubs|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer is afraid of having one of the diamond winners ruffed.|pg||
pc|sT|nt|bagman: Now declarer goes up and starts trumps|pg||
nt|bagman: no need to guess|pg||
nt|petergill: Usually it's better to set up the side suit first, on hands like this one in 5@HX|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good afternoon to Paul Gipson|pg||
nt|corplaw: another pickup for croatia on club guess|pg||
pc|s6|nt|andyv:  when things go bad....|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|hedyg: Bocchi had no info|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, that too.|pg||
nt|andyv:  vul vs. none, you need about 42-44% chance of making game to bid it in mp.|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I am sorry, I lost the play here|pg||
nt|ziff:  Yes. Ruff two @Ds, cash 2 @S, throw in South with the last @C|pg||
pc|h2|nt|athene: yes, the multi allowed EW to say their piece at a lower level and then give up |pg||
nt|paulg:  Hi everyone|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Or even discard two spades on two clubs?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: An interesting expansion of the basic plan|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If it's true what you are saying, the Italians have an advantage when they buy a vugraph box for the entire tournament. Everyone is forced to play against them on vugraph|pg||
nt|mbruun: They have many advantages, the Vu-graph, their system, their cardplay. |pg||
nt|bjacobs: This play is fraught as well - if South is 3-3-4-3, he will eventually be able to overruff dummy|pg||
nt|mamos: yes setting up Clubs may be harder |pg||
nt|frululu: by ouch y mean a good score in american football ? |pg||
nt|schtsch: don't need it|pg||
nt|corplaw: or spade trick :)|pg||

nt|petergill: "heavies"|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: Roland Wald|pg||
nt|ahri: we wish that score for this board could run from the sheet too.|pg||
pc|h6|nt|snetram:  Adam mÃ³gÅ uÅatwiÄ licytujÄc 4 pik z przeskokiem, zamiast trzech|pg||
nt|sybarra: where was either the rebid of @H's or support of H!'s??|pg||
nt|jkotor: choæ wydaje siê p³aski...|pg||
nt|lesniak: zadnychprezentow|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: S explaining to W that he was trying to get his distribution across|pg||
nt|lesniak: 5 impow dla nas bylo gdy Narkiewicz  zagra³ si³a woli a nie si³¹ karty|pg||
nt|schtsch: thats what happens when you double without the @s9|pg||
pc|h5|nt|Vugraphznk: :)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|brgpro: well, he has 4@s as well,....so, opps can't have a cheap contract here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Spain-Belgium must be playing football instead of bridge. The score is 1-0 after 5 boards|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|brolucius: North would rarely lead the @HA from a combination such as A-Q-x, but here the bidding had suggested that neither East nor West held a heart control.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No, just a permanent resident for some time|pg||
nt|cicus: I expected E to try some club ruffs|pg||
nt|hedyg: once pd showed the rounded suits..|pg||
pc|d2|nt|marlowepi: 4 card majors|pg||
nt|hedyg: bd 6 Swiss in 5@c|pg||
nt|snetram:  rozdanie 5 byÅo obrotowe i dziÄki Adamowi wygraliÅmy 5 zamiast przegraÄ 6|pg||
nt|lesniak: moze tez dzieki narkiewiczowi|pg||
nt|jkotor: wczoraj takie zagranie obróci³o 24 w z³¹ stronê, ale Grzeka chyba nic nie zatrzyma|pg||
nt|lesniak: ktory poszedl w obrone 5 trefli|pg||
nt|schtsch: good club spots help, also|pg||
nt|ahri: at least they are connected.|pg||
nt|ahri: so, croatian lead will be cut to less than half after this board|pg||
pc|dK|nt|iceblue: How do you think about this 3@C? Jack|pg||
nt|atabey: would be a good auction if K of @h was offside with a @d lead|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@H over 2@H would show a stronger hand|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: nightmare time for EW, for sure, these few boards|pg||
nt|mbruun: Looks like a quick push|pg||
nt|capercliff: not sure even a @c lead would beat it tho?|pg||
nt|snetram:  co powinno pokazywaÄ renons|pg||
nt|hedyg: seems Lauria's lead gives the contract|pg||
nt|stc: and, as in the case of Madala you may play for different countries|pg||
pc|dT|nt|brgpro: normal|pg||
nt|brolucius: West did hold a singleton heart, in fact, but chose not to cue-bid it because of the general minimum nature of his hand.|pg||
nt|bagman: South needs to return a club after taking the @CA|pg||
nt|petergill: Yes, there's a lack of entries to dummy|pg||
nt|paulg:  everyone playing double dummy now|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|harmon: hi|pg||
nt|harmon: all|pg||
nt|paulg:  Piper's 3NT was some bid by a passed hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Hey Harmon|pg||
nt|hedyg: hi Harmon :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  easily: defense sets up two clubs to go with 2@h and the @dA|pg||
nt|capercliff: yes sry 2@c'c, 2@h's and a @d|pg||
nt|henryb:  I have to leave you for Chicago|pg||
nt|hedyg: bye Henry, ty|pg||
nt|paulg:  i guess Piper knows that North will probably hold a couple of diamonds, as he did not use the 2@H opener (three suits, short in diamonds)|pg||
nt|capercliff: cu Henry, thanks|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Awww Henry|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Thanks Henry, enjoy :)|pg||
nt|paulg:  Piper/Wilkinson have an excellent attitude and memories like goldfish ... a bad score never fazes them|pg||
nt|bagman: ducking twice is fatal|pg||
nt|bagman: Time to count decarer's tricks|pg||
nt|andyv:  his choices would appear limited... either a club or a club or a club|pg||
nt|bagman: Nothing to do if partner hasn't go a trump trick|pg||
nt|brolucius: You can measure the strength of a bridge player by counting the countries in the world that would welcome the player into their national team.|pg||
nt|athene: east will surely hope for the @CQ onside|pg||
nt|schtsch: that's for deception|pg||
nt|schtsch: to give them hope|pg||
nt|corplaw: decl still has some work to do now that didn't finesse JD|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c2|nt|Walddk2: 2NT asking, 3NT= 15+ 5-2-4-2 or 5-3-4-1|pg||
pc|c9|nt|ugis: or even 2h|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|brgpro: i would bid 1@h and, if necessary, bid 2@H again|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|brgpro: but what is important: after 2/1, 3 level new suit better be 5|pg||
nt|lesniak: na 100% pytanie tylko czy pokazuje renons czy tez pyta o asy z wylaczeniem|pg||
nt|sybarra: wonderful system |pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: OK, someting is terribly wrong here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but even with 4 card majors 1S is somewhat questionable, and the double a bit more so holding 3 clubs |pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Declarer ran the hearts then played a small @S|pg||
nt|babs59: regarding last board, many people move with 8 HCP opposite a 15-17 NT|pg||
pc|c3|nt|bagman: Now Sementa needs to dicard the clubs and see what happens|pg||
nt|brolucius: The Smith peter is a signal, normally used only in no-trumps. You play high or low on declarer's first suit (when a count signal is not needed) to say something about how much you ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: like the opening lead.|pg||
nt|lesniak: ladnie ta obrona idzie|pg||
nt|antoniz: jest szansik|pg||
nt|lesniak: E moze zgrac bez ryzyka k dame i blotke trefl|pg||
nt|lesniak: zobaczywszy u adama W trefl bedzie wiedzial co z D pik|pg||
nt|andyv:  actually too well for NS's liking|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer makes 4 trumps one way or another|pg||
pc|cT|nt|barnets: while there appears only 4 losers the entries are tough |pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We have Valerio Guibilo in the audience to explain the sequences by E-W if we need it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Very nice|pg||
nt|hedyg: only 1 overtrick|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: According to piper only 9 trick|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: *tricks|pg||
nt|capercliff: he will claim|pg||
nt|stc: Zia also played at first for Pakistan :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  in imps more will move than mps|pg||
nt|petergill: The club ruff is with the trump winner, 110|pg||
nt|schtsch: @dA|pg||
nt|corplaw: AD and low diamond may be best|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|babs59: I tend not to unless a decent 5 card suit...  applying a Jim Borin 'law'|pg||
pc|d3|nt|bagman: I would guess that declarer cashes out now instead of trying to be a hero|pg||
nt|lesniak: zagranie 9 pik przez Cezarego bylo doskonale|pg||
nt|babs59: which was not to move when the MAXIMUM was the min. you needed for game|pg||
pc|d8|nt|brgpro: if not max, then better be concentrated suits|pg||
nt|Gerben42: @H10 will still be lost, so 80|pg||
nt|koksoy: he  can  do  nothing ...  500|pg||
nt|paulg:  two down and -500, i guess everyone reasonably happy|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|andyv:  just not counting |pg||
nt|cicus: this is an easy hand, it goes down anyway :)|pg||
pc|d5|nt|rodvenn: everybody knows this is about the spade q|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|brolucius: There is a general consensus that you should always cue-bid an ace, provided it does not raise the level of the contract. With a second-round control, you can take a view and ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: decline to cue-bid if you are not suitable for a slam. |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Why would you not be suitable for slam with five controls?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Indeed. I would have bid 4@H.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Particularly as East had not bid that suit.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I am asked about controls. The ace is worth two, the king one control|pg||
nt|Walddk4: So AAK = five|pg||
nt|brolucius: It's a slight problem with auctions that have become game-forcing. The needs to cue-bid controls and to show slam suitability clash somewhat.|pg||
nt|bagman: Pressure|pg||
nt|koksoy: 4@H  need  some  effort|pg||
pc|s9|nt|bagman: Sementa is probably especially happy because defending at 2 level with void vs Q9xxx is always quite risky|pg||
nt|koksoy: and  3nt  is  lay down|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|brolucius: He felt a bit guilty at switching and asked the US team to wear Pakistani costume on one occasion.|pg||
nt|schtsch: still struggling|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|c5|pc|h4|nt|xenya: i think he will get it right now|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|hedyg: he will be disappointed|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hJ|pc|s8|nt|stc: In the meantime switzerland won double game swing to tie|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c4|nt|andyv:  maybe... and didn't listen to the auction or understand the lead|pg||
pc|h7|pc|c7|pg||
nt|vasmar: he must know that N has 4 hearts since he bids 3@h|pg||
nt|iain sime: A diamond lead away from the king has let 5@C through and tied the match.|pg||
nt|ahri: claim|pg||
pc|d4|nt|hedyg: nice defense|pg||

nt|Vugraphznj: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/10ostend/results.htm|pg||
nt|toniemme: 3SA è singolo a @H ?|pg||
nt|cumino: Certo il vantaggio di dire 2SA per alzare la licita con 20 in risposta mi sfugge|pg||
nt|caruga: compensibile, nella sua patavinità|pg||
nt|toniemme: 2SA è per evitare probabili barrage ad alto livello da parte degli avversari che sono in prima|pg||

nt|atabey: that was a strong hand over 2@h|pg||
nt|tez: other table playing 6|pg||
nt|othered1: i think 6@H was right on last hand, given far less than high likelihood of @D lead.|pg||
nt|andyv:  not sure what W dbld on unless it was to stop pd from bidding|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: NS may have missed chance of +800 ..but got +850  :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Are you saying Pass is forcing? :P|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So 13 IMPs to Norway on board 6|pg||
nt|rodvenn: if East had had the spade q, he would have bid more strongly|pg||
nt|bagman: This looks like a flat 4@H with an overtrick|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: After 7 compared boards a 60 IMP lead would be 25-0 with 9 IMPs to spare|pg||
nt|sybarra: do we have the right bd?|pg||
nt|mamos: i think North is worth 3@h if South had rebid 2@D so not quite sure what has happened here|pg||
nt|iain sime: Italy were losing 12 imps anyway so the lead only cost two more.|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I think, by David's measure, Zia must be the best player in the world, for who wouldn't want him on their team?|pg||
nt|brolucius: A diamond lead seems to look right from that East hand.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, he would pick up the whole world.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Same with Meckstroth and Rodwell, and the great Italians.|pg||
nt|petergill: As we are seeing, 3@H can be beaten |pg||
nt|Gerben42: +80 almost never feels bad|pg||
nt|Gerben42: EW turn again|pg||
nt|petergill: To make 2@H, you have to cross to @SQ to lead a heart up, then duck a heart|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 5@D the top spot|pg||
nt|petergill: In 1@H, North's play was just fine, was the safest way to play 1@H|pg||
nt|gulyas: so, a push as expected|pg||
nt|andyv:  and Bulgaria struck back with a 12 imp swing when 3N was set on board 4|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: Tesla standing up and talking to his partner|pg||
nt|schtsch: over hte screen of course|pg||
nt|corplaw: good 6S contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: As yesterday, the speed of play is impressive.|pg||

nt|hedyg: Open one browser window per table|pg||
nt|bagman: He probably knew but was considering that the contract cannot go down unless he can cash another @H trick|pg||
nt|mamos: though I dont play 4 card majors  I dont think its the system thats gone wrong here |pg||
nt|marlowepi: the description of the play siuggests a NT contract, probably N bid 2N over 2S|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: It was the right board, I just entered the wrong contract, my apologies|pg||
nt|schtsch: his head is too big to fit through the screen hole|pg||
nt|wstuart: I wonder if they know they are generating more action than normal?|pg||
nt|ahri: although Tesla is over 2m tall, Oggy is even taller.|pg||
mb|1S|nt|bjacobs: Muppet Stayman at the other table|pg||
nt|mdgraham: should see a NASZ club here|pg||
nt|capercliff: but they should give him 10 tricks?|pg||
nt|lesniak: bo odruch jest zabicie dama|pg||
nt|koksoy: so  as  you  said  everyone  could be happy|pg||
nt|babs59: first blood to Italy who stopped in 3@C on board 4|pg||
mb|1N|nt|andyv:  when it goes pass pass... yes your pass is now forcing... and no one else can bid:)|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, and he knew spades were 3-3|pg||
nt|xenya: 2@S?|pg||
nt|bagman: Here it is very hard to misguess something in the play|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer will play diamonds before spades, hoping to set up a spade discard on the @DK-Q.|pg||
nt|antoniz: tam na szczêcie te¿ nie umieli zagraæ szlema,farcik jest:)|pg||
nt|bagman: In pressure situation "passion rules reason"|pg||

nt|mdgraham: 1@S=7+hcp, 4+@S|pg||
nt|hedyg: hmm did he duck the 2nd @d?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I asked him after the claim and he said 9|pg||
nt|capercliff: even if he claims 9?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: No, he took @DK and heaved a sigh of relief|pg||
nt|rodvenn: splintr|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Mini-splinter, shows diamond support|pg||
nt|xenya: thanks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and denies 4 hearts|pg||

nt|lesniak: jesli partner ma 4 ta 10 ke to jest bez znaczenia|pg||
nt|hedyg: tricky 4@S here|pg||
nt|gohar: not tricky|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3@D might just shut out the spades.|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@S = minors|pg||
nt|gulyas: 2@H makes EW, so 3@C may gain a couple imps|pg||
nt|ziff:  Difficult handtype for S|pg||
nt|schtsch: now it's action time|pg||
mb|d!|nt|pasker: they need to avoid 3NT on this deal|pg||
nt|Gerben42: i guess 5@D will be reached soon|pg||
nt|andyv:  this should wind up in 3N|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: You know what they say about @D :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: always a good topic for debate about whether 1NT should be take-out or natural here |pg||
mb|3H|nt|mdgraham: 2NT=19-23 balanced|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If you must jump to 2NT now, I think you have lost the advantage of opening 1@C|pg||
nt|hedyg: must have (reasonably) ducked the 2nd @d|pg||
nt|hedyg: oh|pg||
nt|hedyg: well then he had 10 tricks|pg||
nt|stc: NS may defend in 5@d|pg||
nt|iain sime: May not find spades if North bounces.|pg||
nt|brolucius: But 2@D seems right on those values, with the dubious heart honours.|pg||

mb|p|nt|brolucius: Some would bid 3@H, a mini-splinter (which would give South much more information).|pg||
nt|atabey: T/O and goodish|pg||
nt|othered1: A possible line on last h and is to cash @HA then try to get @D discard on 4th @S.  I don't think that's best, however.|pg||
nt|tez: kandemir led @d at the other table..interesting now|pg||
nt|daman: will probably end up in 4@Hs on this|pg||
nt|andyv:  probably with good reason|pg||
nt|cicus: I'm waiting for that opportunity|pg||
nt|gulyas: unless its mp scoring, where anything goes|pg||
nt|hedyg: A@H and small @D?|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can easily win the top two trumps and crossruff in diamonds and spades|pg||
nt|skorchev: hi all|pg||
nt|mdgraham: when people open with 10 and respond with 3 you sometimes need a natural NT bid|pg||

nt|bagman: It is possible that E leads a club and then a spade back forces declarer to go up|pg||
nt|bagman: He'll do fine with a diamond lead|pg||
nt|bagman: It's hard to locate a weakness in partner's 4 card suit|pg||
nt|andyv:  a lot riding on the opening lead|pg||
nt|pasker: true lauria might not lead a @S|pg||
nt|brolucius: Take-out double a good move from West - suggests spades but does not go past 3@H.|pg||
nt|petergill: 5@D plays better than 3NT|pg||
nt|barnets: not so safe|pg||
nt|barnets: with bad club break|pg||
mb|4N|nt|othered1: assuming @D lead, of course|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Huge opportunity here|pg||
nt|hedyg: except if he claims 9, yes|pg||
nt|hedyg: then it is his problem|pg||
nt|capercliff: hmm, 1@s not forcing here?|pg||
nt|bagman: does not force as he might have a heart loser|pg||
nt|bagman: so even in that case declarer takes the spade finesse|pg||
nt|sybarra: I see 8 tricks |pg||
nt|mamos: yes|pg||
nt|marlowepi: we will continue to see that number:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: until we see 7|pg||
nt|marlowepi: heart finesse|pg||
nt|cicus: look, Barczy is not afraid of being shot, and it earns hime some IMPs|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: That would show no more than a raise to 3@S that included at most one heart.|pg||
nt|brolucius: I suffered the connection problems that I mentioned 45 minutes ago. Obviously the exorbitant £17.99 that I pay for Boardband each month is not considered sufficient for a good ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: service.|pg||
nt|brgpro: i know for sure that had N bid 3@s, S would have raised to 4, playing the principle of 5-8|pg||
nt|jtr: Entries to play @ss are a problem here|pg||
nt|brgpro: but after 3@H, he has only 3...|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: Principle of 5-8?|pg||
nt|brgpro: used to be called principle of 7|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome Stefan|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i like 3h as forcing spade raise|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Heya Stefan|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Stefan|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the idea is to offer a choice between 3nt and 4s|pg||
mb|5H|nt|iceblue: Zhou doest think it is 16HCP since of the stiff @HQ|pg||
nt|stc: 3@s(170) better the 5@dx-1 !|pg||
nt|stc: or even 140|pg||
nt|iain sime: Or minus 400 (3NT if a club lead)|pg||
nt|hedyg: in the mean time 10 more imps to Italy|pg||
nt|athene: with no overruff possible, he will end up making nine tricks|pg||
nt|skorchev: 3@H by South is either slam interest with @S fit or @S fit, balanced fit, intending to play 3nt/4@S|pg||
nt|skorchev: *balanced hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: you can use this idea over a 1NT opening|pg||
nt|bagman: Sementa has goodish spade intermediates and a fitting Q + singleton|pg||
nt|paulg:  from what I've seen, it is wrong to describe any Duboin as invitational ... it is just a transfer for Sementa to bid game|pg||
nt|koksoy: :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: nice selfcontrol by Assael|pg||
nt|hedyg: anyhow isn't it more likely he plays a @d back?|pg||
nt|bagman: yes|pg||
nt|hedyg: where 4@s was bid and made|pg||
nt|hedyg: on bd 7|pg||
nt|bagman: Sementa might duck this to keep multiple options|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Girls need a deck of cards... A @H to love a man, a @D to marry him, a @C to whack him in the head and a @S to bury him|pg||
nt|babs59: I hadn't heard that one before!|pg||
nt|mdgraham: double smacks of bidding his hand twice imho |pg||
nt|ahri: madala does not look intimidated|pg||
mb|6S|nt|mbruun: Gutsy play|pg||
nt|paulg:  their CC does not say that 1@s is non-forcing|pg||
nt|capercliff: maybe they play it as limited|pg||
nt|athene: even though he sort of has 3 clubs, trump, diamond to lose|pg||
nt|athene: he will take nine tricks first and leave the defence to make a trump and a side-suit winner at the same time|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: Roland Wald|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Indeed. It is quite a modest opening bid - not so close to a strong 1@C.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, but 5-8 is more impressive.|pg||
nt|brgpro: always play pd for 5-8 HCP in these kind of auction...|pg||
nt|jtr: He wisely played them immediately|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: lol, unfamiliar with both of them :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: Oh, right|pg||
nt|brgpro: Berry Westra thought 5-8 is more likely:)|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: What's that based on then?|pg||
nt|jtr: Experience?|pg||
nt|brgpro: probability...although i dont know a bit of it:)|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: Haha, experience and probability are neighbours, aren't they? :)|pg||
nt|bagman: no|pg||
nt|andyv:  will N try to sneak a @h now?|pg||
nt|andyv:  not anymore|pg||
nt|jkotor: szansa na -2?|pg||

nt|ahri: looking at his hand and seeing half of the points there he knows what's going on :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|brgpro: yes, just like u and me! |pg||
nt|andyv:  for running scores|pg||
nt|bagman: :)|pg||
nt|barnets: this rates to be down|pg||
nt|bagman: No the defense has to commit to some line|pg||
nt|bagman: they can draw trumps to prevent the diamond ruffs but then Sementa can set up the hearts|pg||
nt|koksoy: if  defence  can  able to  play  3rd diamond ..  then  they  may  have 2spade heart and  dimond|pg||
nt|paulg:  he is a little short of entries to do everything though|pg||
nt|koksoy: diamond  now|pg||
nt|schtsch: really? maybe he can count his honors?|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  and even if it did, i would raise|pg||
nt|xenya: somewhat unlucky for Norway -- 5@D is a sensible contract|pg||
nt|hedyg: lolllllll famous last words|pg||
nt|petergill: South needs to retain his @D entry to the long spades|pg||
nt|snetram:  powinno byÄ bez dwÃ³ch, ale Cezary bedzie w lekkim przymusie po ÅciÄgniÄciu pikÃ³w. Tylko wskoczenie asem trefl i zagranie w karo uwalnia go od tego|pg||
nt|bagman: A diamond continuation leaves Sementa quite badly placed in Dummy|pg||
nt|ahri: i must admit that i like 3@h|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Madala showing his hand, S W laughing|pg||
pc|cT|nt|gulyas: with Dumbovich in the driving seat, I would not be surprised at all:)|pg||
nt|gulyas: sry, its Gotthard|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Bocchi asking whether 1NT is natural or not|pg||
nt|ahri: hm seems board 7 was corrected to 2@hx-2 |pg||
nt|ahri: or I might have been blind|pg||
pc|c3|nt|daman: this probably requires careful play     ergo the delay|pg||
nt|daman: USA  and England won their soccer matches|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: So Algeria and Slovakia are out of the Football World Cup? :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Sorry George, couldn't resist :)|pg||
nt|daman: I believe so|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I am being told Slovenia|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I was just testing George kibs :) Haha|pg||
nt|bagman: NS have probably promised both majors and clubs as the trick suit|pg||
nt|andyv:  nice method|pg||
nt|fabsayc: see my website for an explanation of this idea|pg||
nt|petergill: Making 3@S requires good guessing in @h and @C|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|fabsayc: under 50%|pg||
nt|Gerben42: it was a part of the Romex system, designed by Mexican top player George Rosenkrantz|pg||
nt|petergill: when a @D is led towards dummy, South needs to duck. Is this hard?|pg||
nt|lesniak: tak|pg||
nt|paulg:  if he ruffed two diamonds, then he'd need the club finesse for a heart pitch and doesn't have the entries for that ....|pg||
nt|paulg:  unless the defence helps!|pg||
nt|koksoy: now  he  may  crossruff|pg||
nt|bagman: This was helpful; now he can afford to ruff the diamonds |pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|mbruun: Looks like a minirally of 1 IMP|pg||
nt|paulg:  i wonder if Wilkinson misread the auction and thought that East bid it|pg||
nt|bagman: now the rest is easy|pg||
nt|barnets: same contract same lead in the open|pg||
nt|babs59: entries are interesting this hand|pg||
nt|schtsch: of course, but his stopper is a bit tiny|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|andyv:  finally a calm board for Lebanon|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe the 3 was attitude?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: When there are imps to be won, you have to go for it|pg||

nt|bagman: Logical to lead a diamond|pg||
nt|vasmar: a potential plus for Cyprus|pg||
nt|petergill: Moment of truth|pg||
nt|petergill: Playing the opening bidder for @HA was reasonable but unlucky|pg||

mb|p|nt|brgpro: 6@d needs @hA to be on...|pg||
nt|brolucius: That deal is worthy of another look afterwards. Very instructive that Bocchi established the spades before playing on trumps. |pg||

nt|athene: but a pre-empt can do that to you|pg||
nt|athene: one area of the game where i am sure most pairs don't have enough methods is after a 3nt overcall of a pre-empt|pg||
nt|gulyas: 4@S makes more tricks - in fact, you  have to guess @Ss to to make 3NT at all|pg||

mb|2C!|nt|Walddk4: Spades and a minor, 5-5|pg||
nt|petergill: which makes East about a 9/17 chance of having @HA in my opinion, so it was a close guess in @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  probably need a @c lead to stop 4@s|pg||
nt|bjacobs: German term|pg||
nt|petergill: Possibly, but at Trick 2 it seems natural to duck to retain your entry. At Trick 4, perhaps it seemed less clear?|pg||
nt|athene: 2@H rather than 3@H makes things much easier|pg||
nt|athene: now transfer and west will do something very enthusiastic|pg||
nt|athene: to show his monster support for spades|pg||
nt|gulyas: 6@S makes with good guesses, not likely to be bid tho|pg||
nt|cicus: still not an easy overcall, double is a sensible alternative|pg||

mb|2N|nt|Walddk4: A Dutch invention|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Google solves all|pg||
nt|bagman: nice result in the open room|pg||
nt|bagman: Difficult situation. 5m can go down a lot and there was no guarantees that 4@H makes|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: South correctly makes no move towards game. He expects that the deal is a mis-fit and his hearts will pull little weight with spades as trumps.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 3@C seems sadistic|pg||
nt|mdgraham: apart from translating the NASZ system....|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@S is the limit and even that is not cold|pg||
nt|bagman: NS can make 5@C|pg||
nt|paulg:  3@d looks like a mixed raise in spades|pg||
nt|paulg:  so 4-card support plus a good card or two|pg||
nt|bagman: Denning has more or less shown only his range without much info about his shape|pg||
nt|paulg:  Denning might bid four or five diamonds|pg||
nt|bagman: Now it's quite hard to recover from the start|pg||
nt|paulg:  i think 5@d |pg||

nt|hedyg: Italy won 21:9 vs Norway|pg||
nt|hedyg: that looks pretty good to me|pg||

nt|sharkey: yes - cud have been much more...|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4 VPs more?|pg||
nt|bagman: W should not bid to sac but to make (on this vulnerability)|pg||

nt|hedyg: 12 tricks are there|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: 2@C is game-forcing balanced or diamond support.|pg||
nt|brgpro: they are on they way...with a lot of relays i think...although we dont really know their agreements|pg||
nt|atabey: on board 7 the lead to 6@h was a dia. declarer didnt take the @h finess. however he could pitch the @d's to @c ace and the 4th @s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Madala's 1NT backfired in the other room|pg||
nt|sharkey: in VP no - IMPs yes :)|pg||
nt|bagman: Now N has values to do something|pg||
nt|hedyg: David when your pd shows a strong hand an ace, a king and Qx in pds suit is not a lot?|pg||
nt|bagman: X or 3@S|pg||
nt|bagman: depending on agreements on X|pg||
nt|lesniak: dobrze wykonane|pg||
nt|bagman: S had already shown a fine @D suit. Now it was time to show some support for partner|pg||
mb|4N|nt|dougdscsu: Bas is god|pg||
nt|hedyg: oh my|pg||
nt|mamos: 3Nt coming|pg||
nt|marlowepi: for most of us, not an appetizing approach to describing the E hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is played from the other side |pg||
nt|andyv:  10 more imps for Bulgaria is Italy stopped at 3@d on board 5|pg||
mb|p|nt|brgpro: my guess is: 2@d=extra length or Bal. min. and 2@h asked which, 2@s showed the later|pg||
nt|brolucius: An initial response of 3@C would be 8-11 natural.|pg||
nt|jtr: It needs very specific cards facing a weak NT which i imagine Bocchi has shown by now|pg||
nt|jtr: Madala is maybe just looking for the best game|pg||
nt|brolucius: It would be quite a system triumph to identify that you were CLOSE to a slam. |pg||
nt|brgpro: the perfect card S can find is: xx  KQx xxxxx Akx|pg||
nt|brolucius: xx/Axxx/AKx/Qxxx also good.|pg||
nt|brgpro: that isn't that min....he might rebid 2NT with that|pg||
nt|brgpro: now he is on the corss road...go beyond 3NT or not...|pg||
nt|jtr: I imagine 2@d showed the weak NT with 2NT showing something else  Common methods which i myself use|pg||
nt|brolucius: The convention card says 2NT rebid is 12-14 balanced but may not be bid with x-x in a suit. Here he has a low doubleton spade.|pg||
nt|jtr: I cant see that David|pg||
nt|brgpro: so 2NT asked his weakness and 3@s showed it?|pg||
nt|brolucius: At the end of the notes - last section.|pg||
nt|jtr: ah!|pg||
nt|jtr: Wow you are efficient!|pg||
nt|brolucius: In fact 2NT rebid is 11-14 balanced, with no low doubleton.|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am spurred into action by the presence of top-class commentators alongside.|pg||
nt|hedyg: lucky to find K@H with 3 @ss|pg||
nt|atabey: so it was unbeatable afterall. the lead didnt matter|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Fayad values the hand as stronger than Versace did in othr room .. but they still stop short of game|pg||
nt|capercliff: maybe its Lauria's turn to only claim 10?:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: esp when opps can bid spades, highly likely when u r short there, your main suit can get buried|pg||
nt|mamos: no double because it asked for a spade nd here Spade holder on lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: but he found the lead |pg||
nt|Gerben42: only the best graduate from the Blue Team bridge school|pg||
nt|barnets: well clearly north likes to bid a lot|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Some play XX here instead of 3@H has an invite to 4@H so that 3@H can be used for competition, or just push opps out|pg||

nt|brgpro: finally he dicided to cross the boarder|pg||
nt|jtr: Ah of course, they cant have 18-19 balanced|pg||
nt|sharkey: The way this match is going may also influence NS bidding here|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't think EW need to speculate|pg||
nt|petergill: Janis Ozols likes to compete, as we saw earlier on a hand that cost 5 imps|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: EW amazed at dummy|pg||
nt|gulyas: this another 2 imps to HUN, regardless of making 5 or 6|pg||
mb|d|nt|Walddk2: A Gazzilli sequence got them to the 3-level|pg||
nt|Walddk2: was impossible for Madala to stop short after that|pg||
nt|schtsch: woohoo|pg||
nt|schtsch: the lead is set|pg||
mb|p!|nt|bagman: Here Sementa is unlikely to drop the @CK|pg||
nt|hedyg: J@H works well here|pg||
nt|skorchev: Bulgaria won 10 imps in board 5, since Madala-Bocchi stopped at 3@D+2 ... (5@D= was played here)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: They open 2@c with that|pg||
nt|brgpro: i think 4NT shows odd number of key cards....i played a lot of Italian pairs, still dont quite understand their turbo method|pg||
nt|brolucius: If anyone bid and made 6@D against me on these cards, I would think that I was not destined to win the match.|pg||
nt|hedyg: lets try not to exaggerate :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: wudnt bet on it....:)|pg||
nt|bagman: If he ever gets to dummy|pg||
nt|sybarra: I would hard pressed to find a low sp lead from the N holding |pg||
nt|petergill: He is a passed hand, so he knew if partner passed the Dbl that it would be OK|pg||
nt|barnets: not surprised|pg||
nt|snetram:  ale zagrania dwa razy atu- poÅÄczone z impasem - wygrywa|pg||
nt|koksoy: @S R lead  overtaken by  A  and  diamond  ...  now??  decision  time|pg||
nt|bagman: South might guess this; the defense would have played 2 rounds of spades if there was need for @D finesse|pg||
mb|5S|mb|p|nt|bagman: he might be forced to|pg||
nt|bagman: ok the old trick|pg||
nt|lesniak: nie wszyscy majatak¹ szansê- niektorzy np Francuzi graja ,¿e 2 tref i po 2 karach 2 kier jest inwituj¹ce|pg||

mb|p|nt|brgpro: not that bad...only a little less than 50% slam...|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, it's not a bad slam particularly but difficult to bid, as you said earlier.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://psbridge.gotdns.com/bbo/allvug/  - Vugraph Hand Records (PDF)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: lol thanks all (and Doug)|pg||
nt|capercliff: im not really sure what to say about this auction|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: It was actually (again!) someone coming in for the BM|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I should just gag them...|pg||
nt|bagman: Now @H + spade guarantees set if E has Qxx of diamonds|pg||
nt|schtsch: sorry for this cheering, we are watching football and i got carried away|pg||
pc|c7|nt|brolucius: If you don't play a two-suited 2@S, then many would open a normal weak 2@S on that North hand.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Correction, the minor can be four cards only|pg||
nt|brolucius: Anyway, it seems that they had a splendid investigative auction and decided, very reasonably, to stay out of it.|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: In Pairs it might've been easier, raising 5@D to 6@D because it's bad score anyway :)|pg||
nt|daman: he need to play a @S or a @D|pg||
pc|c3|nt|daman: s|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can be pretty sure the @DA is right|pg||
nt|hedyg: S thought pd had singleton @S not to raise to 3@s|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|bagman: Sementa probably reasoned that N must have the @CK to pass|pg||
nt|sharkey: still need to locate a few honors yet so too early to play for drop|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: There's an orchestra practising just on the other side of a wall here|pg||
nt|babs59: I would have thought West would continue the trump attack|pg||
nt|corplaw: 10 imps for croatia|pg||
pc|cA|nt|daman: yes|pg||
nt|athene: firstly @SAK @DA is 1@S not 2@S|pg||
pc|c8|nt|atabey: kolata did not dbl 2@h. which I believe was a better move. and he earned 5 imps|pg||
nt|athene: secondly with the @DA north would be more likely to just clear the spades|pg||
nt|rodvenn: the 6 points on 5 is also well deserved to Italy, but the 10imps on 1 is slightly lucky|pg||
pc|c4|nt|bagman: Now south wanted the @ST back|pg||

nt|bagman: West cannot believe that S has Axx of clubs|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|bagman: Technically and in isolation, declarer should have lead @HJ to pick up KTx onside. Here, however, the @HJ was needed to guard against diamond overruf|pg||
nt|marlowepi: once W bids the suit you have to lead a low one at IMPs|pg||
nt|wstuart: not until he cashes his @CA  :)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|schtsch: trump promotion|pg||
nt|schtsch: not needed though|pg||
pc|d3|nt|hedyg: and a @c back|pg||
nt|brolucius: After a club lead (against that 5@D doubled), declarer simply drew trumps and set up a club winner in the South hand to pitch the spade loser from dummy.|pg||
nt|paulg:  not an easy situation to read|pg||
pc|s5|nt|athene: ok, he isn't risking the contract for an overtrick|pg||
nt|athene: fair enough|pg||
nt|hedyg: why not K@H before @s finesse?|pg||
nt|gulyas: just plain Dumbovich, getting everything right|pg||
nt|ziff:  More or less the same defence at both tables|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Declarer took a finesse from dummy, but I have no clue how...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: too unlikely that partner has 2 tricks of his own|pg||
nt|barnets: in the open north was content with just 1 X|pg||
nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@h on a @s lead would have been (only just) -1, but the 4@S overcall at this vulnerability is normal|pg||
pc|d4|nt|hedyg: he could have played the 9|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Partner usually has 4 spades when he doubles 1@H, but not always as we see|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In an ideal world he has|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Still, this 4-3 fit is fairly harmless.  And if partner has extras, he will bid, and I can show my heart stopper next|pg||
nt|bjacobs: North thinking here is an overbid|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it's not an ideal world, even though it's the only one we've got|pg||
nt|mbruun: I dont think you should interfer over 1 H with the North hand after partner passed. Game is highly unlikely, and partner can still bidd with good distibution|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Wow|pg||
nt|sybarra: I would 1 @S  but my better suit is @D's here |pg||
nt|mbruun: I just turned 21 yesterday|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Minimum|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@D asking for shortage I believe, not sure|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: With NS overcalling style, the S hand would be considered a maximum, right?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well not a minimum for sure|pg||
nt|bagman: S hoping that the @HK is with length|pg||
nt|hedyg: their CC says they play Ghestem|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: No one likes a 4333 except for when the opps have one|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The textbooks say that you have one heart too many and one spade too few for a take-out double|pg||

nt|atabey: oops|pg||
nt|othered1: I must have the wrong convention card for NS.  It calls for 1@C opening on south's hand.|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: This is interesting|pg||
nt|hedyg: nobody forces Zorlu to anything|pg||
nt|athene: this is unlikely to make|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: ... Lavazza girls ... lol|pg||
nt|daman: serbia gained 12 on Board 9    Italy never got to game in the OR|pg||
nt|daman: he can make this.......double dummy|pg||
nt|athene: the multi-2@D has definitely been outscoring the natural 2@S opener this match|pg||
nt|daman: yes|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Serbia leading Italy by 24 with 9 compared boards, who would've though|pg||
nt|athene: despite common claims that it can't be better to allow opps so much more room|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that never stopped the Italians, and it doesn't seem to do them any harm |pg||
nt|rodvenn: also the board 8 shows better judgement and system by the Italians. |pg||
nt|sharkey: Slovakia off the Schneider??|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, 1NT looks OK.|pg||
nt|sharkey: 1 NT by N may be an alternative as well|pg||
nt|bagman: North hasn't made this, yet|pg||
nt|marlowepi: spade natural lead|pg||
nt|brolucius: 5@D was the obvious move if South does decide to advance.|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Wouldn't this be a 2@D overcall then?|pg||
nt|iain sime: My experience is the same as David's.|pg||
nt|hedyg: no Bas|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now he only needs to maake it|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I thought 3@C two highest remaining, cuebid two most extreme and 2NT the two lowest|pg||
nt|athene: 3@C from sementa showing less than 8 hcp|pg||
nt|gulyas: same spot, and a likely push|pg||
nt|athene: both sides played it from the singleton hand|pg||
nt|athene: as no-one ever bids clubs to mean clubs these days|pg||
mb|2N|an|BAL, denies 4!H|nt|marlowepi: sometimes you catch Txxxxx with partner and 22. or you may find Axxxx|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@d would be majors|pg||
nt|cicus: and, incidentally, both rooms played the contract from the south hand|pg||
nt|gulyas: OR cos of prec 1@C, and Gazilli here|pg||
nt|cicus: hmm, I should write shorter sentences|pg||
nt|athene: declarer's only decision is whether to try @SAKQ for a diamond discard|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: lol|pg||
nt|athene: i thinky you probably do|pg||
nt|athene: think|pg||
nt|andyv:  a claimer for 5... I wonder what the alert was for.  Maybe NS play NAMYATS|pg||
nt|ziff:  Versace probably is a bit nervous about @D Kx, but he can t right-side the contract anyway, and his partner has the right cards for him|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West will be pleased to see a non-@DQ opening lead|pg||
nt|petergill: On Bd 6, 6@S would be a wonderful contract to reach. Nobody has bid 6@S so far. Here is Group B's scores on Bd 6 http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/runningsc...|pg||

nt|bagman: There are something like 6 to 7 losers|pg||
nt|sharkey: by no means no - the way the match has developed so far....|pg||
nt|bagman: Slovakia might get 5 IMPs but this can be also flat|pg||
nt|brolucius: Of course it would be foolish of East to double just because he has loads of points - an insult to the opponents (even if they were not Italian).|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He can, double dummy, but that is not the same as he will|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@d majors, 2NT @H+@C, 3@C @S+@C|pg||
nt|stc: @s is probably best play|pg||
nt|Walddk2: East is squeezed to pieces without the count|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Maybe we play different Ghestems :) So many modifications around these days|pg||
nt|brolucius: Many actual partnerships play different Ghestems, as Iain pointed out.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: See what happens to East if Bocchi cashes lots of trumps|pg||
nt|hedyg: he can drop the @ds?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But then Bocchi can set up spades in comfort|pg||
nt|stc: The last 6 cards are 3@c, 2@s and 1@d|pg||
nt|hedyg: so i think Mossop could have a played a higher card than the 6|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If East has no more diamonds|pg||
nt|hedyg: though*|pg||
nt|hedyg: any reason not to?|pg||
nt|athene: well you might sometimes run into a defensive crossruff where just drawing trumps worked better, but it's pretty unlikely|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer might hold up twice and then try to set up a heart|pg||

nt|mbruun: I would hesitate for 30 sec and pass. That shows 3343 and 15HCP in my system|pg||
nt|schtsch: so madala showing 54 or 44?|pg||
nt|schtsch: 1nt is 12-14 balanced?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Yes|pg||
nt|corplaw: 5N pick a slam, but S not sure what slam to pick|pg||
nt|corplaw: 6C, 6S and 6N all make with club position|pg||
nt|ahri: even 6@h could make :)|pg||
nt|schtsch: madala would like to pick 6@c but suit is not a great one|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I think South believes that given he's shown 45 already, how come partner didn't set clubs with 3@C's|pg||
nt|schtsch: enough, though|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: If South has 2434 it is also likely that he would bid 3NT over 2NT|pg||
nt|schtsch: correct, so he is marked with 2425|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Since 2NT over 2@H would most likely deny 4 clubs|pg||
mb|6S|an|I picked, you play|nt|Walddk4: I thought that range died in the 60's|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: lol, I was referring to group B running scores :)|pg||
nt|athene: if you allow them more room in tricky, complicated situations, it can work out very well when they get their shoelaces tangled up|pg||
nt|athene: anyway we will discover the best line of play in a moment, because duboin will choose it :)|pg||

nt|hedyg: looking at dummy @d is his only chance!|pg||
nt|stc: a BIG point now|pg||
nt|iain sime: This doesn't work if a diamond is played. The squeeze would have worked- East had to keep all his black cards so declarer could have given up a spade.|pg||

nt|bagman: This looks like a flat 450 at both tables :)|pg||

nt|hedyg: then he is down immediately|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't think so, Constantin|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is part of the odds of bidding such slams (and well done for bidding it) that the defenders may not be card perfect. It was a tricky one for East.|pg||
nt|stc: E must play @s|pg||
nt|iain sime: Win the lead and play all the trumps would have worked.|pg||
nt|stc: if he ducks the @d E must play @s to beat|pg||
nt|brolucius: East had no idea at all how the diamond suit lay.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It won't help East to come down to 2 spades, 1 diamond and 3 clubs. Then declarer can ruff out the clubs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: There was a legitimate line |pg||
nt|Walddk2: But a little easier for us|pg||

nt|daman: now a @S game for EW|pg||
nt|hedyg: while the Italians stop playing?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: So you werent tempted to venture some of your 'hard' earned dosh?:)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3nt overcall?|pg||
nt|jbgood: multi, 2@s would have shown 8-11 hcp and 6 cards|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4S easier to make than to bid|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 4@S is one too high, though|pg||
nt|andyv:  a very strong NT|pg||
nt|paulg:  Denning with a Meckwell-style 1@d opener, is there a worse 11 points?|pg||
nt|andyv:  but you are right...4@s would show about 7 tricks and 4@d (namyats) would show about 7.5 to 8 tricks|pg||
nt|babs59: some believe Namyats should have more control of outside suits than that hand - eg singleton in one of the 'less stopped' suits|pg||
mb|p|nt|gulyas: as I said before so many times, a likely push:)|pg||
mb|2C!|an|Majors, minors or M+ longer m|nt|brgpro: i dont mind opeing 3@d with the S cards although we were taught not to do so|pg||
nt|daman: if they can get there|pg||
nt|rodvenn: or on board 8 a misundeerstanding: the double of the 2@S splinter bid howed spades. But Svendsen seem tu have thought it was an OD, showing hearts|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Hoftaniska asked me to call the TD|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Not sure what it was all about|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: He seemed to want Bocchi to tell the TD what he told him. The TD just told Hofta to stop...|pg||
nt|bagman: I've been wrong before, though, in my estimates|pg||
nt|antoniz: jak wysoko dojad¹?|pg||
nt|barnets: In his earlier days young Madala would have opened 4@S as would many- now he opened 1@S and got a plus|pg||
nt|athene: interesting choice of overcall - 1nt was definitely an option there|pg||
nt|gulyas: or dbl|pg||
nt|cicus: E had many choices here, including X and 1NT|pg||
nt|schtsch: 2@c something|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: i dont like the 2@H bid :(|pg||
nt|hedyg: what is wrong with 2NT?|pg||
nt|brolucius: If Hedy and I would both rebid 2NT it must be right.|pg||
nt|bagman: It all depends on their methods. Playing standardish 2@H is wrong but here we do not know.|pg||
nt|hedyg: :) ty David|pg||
nt|sharkey: I think we all wud join in|pg||
nt|Gerben42: I guess if the Blue Team school told him not to, perhaps we all should listen ?|pg||
nt|bagman: Yes, if no aces :)|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|brolucius: Italya are more likely to win this than England are to beat Slovenia in the World Cup and England are '2-to-1 on'.|pg||
nt|othered1: here 6@D is OK with @C lead and excellent without it.|pg||
nt|atabey: never reachable 6@d|pg||
nt|hedyg: slam in @d is on IF he finds Q@s|pg||
nt|bagman: This looks like a quiet push in 1NT|pg||
nt|snetram:  bardzo obrotowe rozdanie|pg||
nt|bagman: Without any other knowledge running the @H9 is correct as A/Q offside are equal but 9 takes care of the AQx|pg||
nt|mamos: Blue Club type strong Club|pg||
nt|sybarra: blasted into it at other table|pg||
nt|andyv:  and still no one biting|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: ciekawe czy dawno ch³opaki wymieniali tarcze cierne w hamulcach...choc na widno szlemik idzie|pg||
nt|petergill: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/runningscores/asp/BoardacrossCondit.asp?qboard=006.18..819 for Group A on Bd 6|pg||
nt|schtsch: not natural|pg||
nt|frululu: @c+higher perhaps  ?|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  you do need some parameters to make the bid meaningful|pg||
mb|3C|an|*|nt|othered1: is north worth 3@D in their methods?  That could get south interested?|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@c is transfer|pg||
nt|bagman: This should have been a quiet push :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  Hi Pekka:)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I never said that - it was Mathias :)|pg||
nt|rodvenn: so there may have been a wrong explanation to Svendsen ... |pg||
nt|fabsayc: this auction strange, did west really pass 2@H|pg||
nt|fabsayc: diamond suit blocked|pg||
nt|ahri: i am not sure if 6@s was played in best manner, if east held KQx clubs and 4 hearts with jack, bocchi killed his squeeze by playing 3 rounds of hearts first|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Like a moment for a horror film. Strangely, the bookies have maintained exactly the same odds for England still to win the World Cup. 8/1 fourth favourites.|pg||
nt|bagman: Balancing against 1x-1y-1NT is quite dangerous business as the opps know what they have|pg||
nt|marlowepi: predict they will reach it here now|pg||
nt|stc: When E has only 6 cards the dec has not more trump|pg||
nt|bagman: Jxxx KJx Qxx KJx|pg||
nt|paulg:  you can often tell a pair's opening style by looking at responder's hand after a 1NT overcall|pg||
nt|koksoy: :)|pg||
nt|paulg:  if you were a very sound pair, then you might double with 8 points (or at least consider it)|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: and often have no fit|pg||
nt|bagman: With his late X, East has indicated heart values|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Oh, sorry Mathias :)|pg||
nt|antoniz: na trafieniu kara 12 lew|pg||
nt|barnets: good reason|pg||
nt|andyv:  another 3N hand|pg||
nt|babs59: yes, so maybe @HAx  and Dx  instead - giving more controls|pg||
nt|ahri: i might be overseeing something though|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 1 club honour onside = 75% though, with the added chance of hearts 3-3 or 4-2 with @HJx|pg||
mb|d|nt|brolucius: Nor have they improved Argentina's odds, despite them looking so strong. Roland will explain the betting on the Denmark team.|pg||
nt|mbruun: First quarter 46-0 for Italy, second quarter 8-0 for Lithuania, now its time for the third|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That's a good stop ... it's a tempting hand, but the lack of aces is crucial|pg||
nt|hedyg: and the lead is....directed!|pg||
nt|brolucius: In the old days 1@D - 3@S would show the North hand. Now it is usually used as a splinter bid agreeing diamonds.|pg||
nt|hedyg: disc @c on @d and claim when that works for 11 tricks|pg||
nt|bagman: NS' system card states: NAT: maybe reverse bids|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am told that in Poland a 2NT rebid denies four hearts.|pg||
nt|snetram:  kara trzeba grac na impas|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: a 13?|pg||
nt|athene: west did well to bid the hearts rather than doubling|pg||
nt|petergill: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/runningscores/asp/BoardacrossCondit.asp?qboard=006.17..817 = Women's results on Bd 6|pg||
nt|ziff:  6@C would have been a terrific contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: how strong a  hand has north shown and how many @D?|pg||
nt|andyv:  agree... fighting against 90 is fine in match points... in imps it can be costly|pg||
nt|andyv:  Surprised that Bocci pulled it.|pg||
nt|xenya: perhaps 2@H showed a real suit|pg||
nt|antoniz: po kierowym bedzie trochê k³opotów|pg||

nt|snetram:  tylko impas karo moze daÄ dodatkowÄ lewÄ|pg||
nt|lesniak: nie na 2 stronne przebitki ma 12 lew|pg||
nt|pasker: N/S should be able to escape to 2@D here|pg||
nt|pasker: Some people play 1NT as a stronger hand in this position as you can just pass with a weak nt having already opened the bidding|pg||
nt|bagman: Sout has values to compete|pg||
nt|athene: i guess his reasoning was, partner can still bid 3@S over 3@H if he has four|pg||
nt|cicus: probably|pg||
nt|athene: with 5 spades and 4 hearts you would be more inclined to double 3@D, i think|pg||
nt|gulyas: right|pg||
nt|gulyas: he was afraid they would miss the 5-3 fit|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 2@C Puppet Stayman?|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: Roland Wald|pg||
nt|schtsch: showtime|pg||
nt|schtsch: again|pg||
nt|corplaw: declarer might prefer to play for one honor onside than for squeeze|pg||
nt|ahri: he can always try for that later as he still has diamond entry i think?|pg||
nt|schtsch: double is penalty?|pg||
nt|schtsch: madala has an easy pass on penalty|pg||
nt|schtsch: why is he thinking?|pg||
nt|schtsch: about the weather?|pg||
mb|3H|nt|hedyg: 4@ds and 10ish|pg||
nt|capercliff: it seems Piper is prepared to bid 3N on anything|pg||
nt|paulg:  2NT is not an invitational bid, it is a relay ... it says bid game if you have your first bid|pg||
nt|xenya: over the double|pg||
nt|bogier: na przebitki jest 12|pg||
nt|stc: anyway, it was a 26 IMP swing|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphznk: A kib expert on Italian methods tells me XX is @H worries|pg||
nt|bagman: Does anybody know what XX meant?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Actually, it's not clear that even the lowly 2@S will make|pg||
nt|hedyg: ohhhhhhhh|pg||
nt|bagman: proven wrong again :(|pg||
nt|hedyg: they cannot afford to throw tricks away like this|pg||
nt|brolucius: I don't really see the value in such a method because North can introduce hearts over a 2NT rebid. Meanwhile, South has given an excellent description of his hand.|pg||
nt|sharkey: the @H reverse distorts the S hand as well|pg||
nt|hedyg: definitely|pg||
nt|sharkey: unless that's their agreement|pg||
nt|bagman: There are multiple structures a bidding system can be built on. I don't think that we have the competence to analyze them all|pg||
nt|hedyg: a reverse should show shape as well as strength|pg||
nt|brolucius: Well, if it does include this type, in the system, it certainly creates a less accurate description of the hand. |pg||
nt|marlowepi: E has too many primes to pass if W raises|pg||
nt|mamos: surely now|pg||
nt|babs59: I guess Bas bookmarked those links - as instructed?|pg||
mb|3S|nt|iceblue: interesting PASS|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 500-1, our team is rubbish; you will see that tomorrow against the Netherlands|pg||
nt|andyv:  probably the redbl may have been too expensive for him if they made it.|pg||
nt|andyv:  well, this contract isn't all that elegant|pg||

nt|jtr: Unusually unpartiotic of you David|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am very partiotic and will be cheering them on.|pg||
nt|andyv:  5 tricks off the top and a 6th if they don't squander their @d communications|pg||
nt|andyv:  N on lead so trot out his AK@h|pg||
nt|paulg:  but it is the modern game ... get in there and cause trouble (for someone)|pg||
nt|bagman: South's hand happens to be on top of my balanced hand range for 1@S opening|pg||
nt|paulg:  nothing attractive here, i guess Shields will switch to dummy's weaker major|pg||
nt|bagman: I would happily accept a game invitation by partner|pg||
nt|bagman: He might play a diamond and then get a spade through|pg||
nt|paulg:  a diamond is probably safe too, as partner will do the right thing|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: If NS are happy with their methods, I see no reason why we should judge them|pg||
nt|petergill: NS play Standard|pg||

nt|brolucius: Excellent!|pg||
nt|mbruun: Can you make 2 Sp?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: For example, if South covers @S9 with @SJ ("cover an honour with an honour") how does declarer make it?|pg||

nt|petergill: At the other table, West played @DK, @DQ then @D to ace, and East played a 4th @D , hoping partner had a spade greaer than the 8|pg||

nt|hedyg: OR stopped in 5@d|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: So he'll cash @SAK Yalcin? :)|pg||

nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Haha|pg||
nt|capercliff: im not sure he can get this right, is there a case to playing the double @d finesse instead of low to the J?|pg||
nt|hedyg: was there a case to play @c?|pg||
nt|hedyg: i thought that was risky|pg||
nt|hedyg: he needs the @ds for his contract|pg||
nt|capercliff: i dont think the defence can stop 9 tricks as it happens|pg||
nt|rodvenn: Hofta realised he could not beat the contract|pg||
nt|snetram:  ma jeszcze czas przez dwie lewy|pg||
pc|h2|nt|brolucius: I checked the instructions on my various packets of heart pills and they made no mention of taking an extra dose before England world cup matches.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if N has stiff heart ace, that line would make|pg||
nt|bagman: Now declarer has no time to get that long heart|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|fabsayc: or|pg||
pc|h4|nt|bagman: This is still likely to make: often defense might set up 6th trick in trumps but here declarer has the spots |pg||
nt|brolucius: As often happens, the Italians used 10 bids where the Slovakians thought that 4 were enough. Once in a while, the longer auction would diagnose a good slam, so the extra work can ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: pay off.|pg||
nt|hedyg: so he could have played J@d, then a @s to the 8|pg||
nt|stc: What is the %play in trump here ? I think small to the 9 sligthly better|pg||
nt|brolucius: Iain makes a good point about 11-14 being too large a range to cover accurately.|pg||
nt|Gerben42: at least 3@S wouldnt have been let through here either :)|pg||
nt|babs59: interesting - with no @D at trick 2, North would play the @C the other way, for safety|pg||
pc|h9|nt|bjacobs: The winning contract was probably 1NT.  It could be reached if, for example, West opens 1NT|pg||
nt|bagman: anyhow a flat 450, wasn't it|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I was told 11, but corrected to 10 now|pg||
nt|bagman: ok|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok ty Bas|pg||

nt|bagman: N really should have gone and played the spade|pg||

nt|cicus: how would you play it on  a@D lead?|pg||
nt|hedyg: as does 6NT then|pg||
nt|hedyg: i think not even Roland would bid it|pg||

nt|hedyg: no, Roland slams are 12.89%|pg||

nt|marlowepi: well it wasnt a terribly confident auction, but still...opps are NV which means smaller penalty and also less likelihood EW have done something very overambitious|pg||
nt|brolucius: As I have mentioned before. Marc Smith tells me that in his system there is no way to avoid 3NT with 11 opposite 11. The responding hand raises the 2NT rebid to 3NT, in case opener ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: has 14. But he claims that such 22-point 3NT contracts are usually made. Not when I try it! |pg||
nt|hedyg: V/L play 1@s as 10-21 and Versace did NOT open!|pg||
nt|cicus: spades must come in anyway if you lose a trump so best seems a small trump to the 10|pg||
nt|athene: on a diamond lead you don't want to risk them knocking out the dummy entry which you might need for the spades|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes... we were trying to remember when last time Italy lost back to back matches|pg||
nt|petergill: 6@C, 6@S and 6NT are all playable, but how can North know that South has @C9, or South know that North has @C10? Too tough.|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  at adverse vulnerability and a spade void, i'd be very nervous opening a strong 1@c|pg||
nt|paulg:  what level will the bidding be at when it gets back to me?|pg||
mb|1N|nt|brgpro: seems it showed @s |pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 27 and 26 IMPs difference is 1 VP too btw Andy :)|pg||

nt|andy_h: 2@D is "trash multi", which is like a weak 2 except the strength is 2-7 and can be a 5 card suit|pg||
nt|xenya: deaja vu of sorts -- if NS bid 6@H or 6N, they will make it|pg||
nt|jbgood: Brogeland is in 6 hearts in the OR|pg||
nt|andy_h: This will allow 2M openings to be 8-11 which can be destructive and constructive in nature.  If you have ever come across those 6M with 10hcp that doesn't deem worthy of a 1M or a ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: 2M opening, then having the 2M=8-11 really helps|pg||
nt|rodvenn: qj of spades maybe a worry for Bocchi|pg||
nt|xenya: but 6@C will be problematic|pg||
nt|sharkey: For those who want to study Lohay-Henc system you find it here : http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/May/OpenTeams/slovakia/henc-lohay.pdf|pg||
nt|brolucius: Hedy has to allow time for a restaurant lunch before the Portugal-Brazil game. |pg||
nt|bagman: Nothing works for EW on this hand. Luckily they are nv|pg||
nt|sybarra: quite a lead directing over call!|pg||
nt|petergill: It looks simple to do this, but it is not|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@D Precision, 11-15|pg||
nt|athene: well, you might just bash out @HAK and then hope to ruff spades down with the diamond as entry|pg||
nt|athene: it perhaps depends whether you get a club or diamond lead|pg||
nt|hedyg: in the mean time Hungary is in 12th position|pg||
nt|gulyas: thats what I thought|pg||
nt|cicus: but the entry is important only if spades are 3-3 with Q offside|pg||
nt|andyv:  this one still has a lot of boards|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but in this type of event you treat it as one long match, since the objective is qualification|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: ciekawe, ¿e w otwartym Szwed nie zagra³ na wygranie gry tylko pokornie siê podda³ i zarobi³ 2 impy|pg||
nt|koksoy: 6@H  -1   is  my  guess...  |pg||
nt|bagman: N has good enough hand to bid 4NT or more for take out and then correct @C to diamonds|pg||
nt|paulg:  according to the CC, double is takeout emphasising the majors|pg||
nt|babs59: today has been our coldest (possibly South Australia's wettest) day of the year|pg||
nt|schtsch: he will bid it as 14-16|pg||
mb|p|nt|jkotor: mo¿e wist z dubla karo nie by³ mo¿liwy?|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: (14)15-17 NT|pg||
nt|andyv:  W bid 3@S here and N dbld in OR|pg||
nt|andyv:  it can be expensive that one VP|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 3@S could be called enterprising, even NV vs V|pg||
nt|bagman: West has no defense and no distributional surprises|pg||
nt|andyv:  well within the Versace playbook:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: lol|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe it meant colors |pg||
nt|marlowepi: perhaps W pulled wrong card, meaning to bid 1H|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I'd love to play with Marc Smith in that case lol|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 6@H seems reasonable|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 3NT solid @D with too much on the side?|pg||
nt|petergill: 3NT = solid @D's and close to 15 points|pg||
nt|athene: yes, that's quite a small factor|pg||
nt|koksoy: as  both  red  suits divided 4-0  I think  he  can  not  make  slem|pg||
nt|bagman: With both reds breaking as they are, 5@H is the limit|pg||
nt|koksoy: 3 @H   --  5nt  ??|pg||
nt|bagman: They surely bid slam, though|pg||
nt|paulg:  may gain 3 imps even if you go down in 6@h|pg||
nt|paulg:  there will be a few 7@h on the scoresheet|pg||
nt|koksoy: may  be..|pg||
nt|bagman: Declare might make 6@H X against careless defense|pg||
nt|paulg:  Denning may splinter in clubs here|pg||
nt|bagman: N wins the black lead and plays @HJ not covered|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 6H is good defence against 6C|pg||
nt|koksoy: 5 nt  is an old  conventition called  Josephine which asks partner about trump  quality  for  garandslem|pg||
nt|bagman: True, but EW have to find that suit first|pg||
nt|petergill: NS's 1NT is 14-16, so the 1NT rebid was 11-13 (or a very good 10)|pg||
nt|ziff:  Probably|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Again 2NT to show a weak hand. Partner is expected to rebid 3@C on most shapes. A direct 3@C would have been stronger.|pg||
nt|andyv:  that's why 4 person teams rarely win... just too much bridge over a short period of time.|pg||
pc|s6|nt|bagman: Against good opponents 3@S might help them more than hurt them|pg||
nt|rodvenn: 6@h is easier. then declarer can investigate the distribution|pg||
nt|xenya: same in 6N|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: jak prosisz Irlandczyków Antoni to po angielsku|pg||
nt|sybarra: or is it transfer to hts?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I can see a TD call coming here|pg||
nt|Gerben42: define "too much" pd hasnt promised much|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Too much for a gambling 3NT|pg||
nt|Gerben42: gives Romanovski a tough decision|pg||
nt|petergill: Janis Romanovski realised that his void in partner's suit was terrible for higher contracts - well done|pg||
nt|athene: it's a good advertisement for a) not leading a singleton trump and b) not leading a trump against a small slam|pg||
nt|gulyas: they do have all the controls in the pack|pg||
nt|athene: but i doubt north is going to lead a heart :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: all like 3@H?|pg||
nt|hedyg: i prefer 3NT|pg||
nt|gulyas: its a nice suit|pg||
nt|cicus: I do|pg||
nt|hedyg: is it?|pg||
nt|gulyas: but I can see 3NT as well|pg||
nt|hedyg: the problem is that pd does not have AK@C!|pg||
nt|athene: whether 3@H is a nice suit will depend on how declarer plays it :)|pg||
nt|gulyas: all the controls show towards a suit contract|pg||
nt|hedyg: so you show that|pg||
nt|hedyg: he is imposing @hs and the suit just isnt good enough for that|pg||
nt|cicus: E has a problem here, he would like to invite to 6@H|pg||
nt|schtsch: spade?|pg||
nt|schtsch: what happened to fourth best nowadays?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Interesting that Bocchi didn't overcall 1@H as 1@D promises 0@D|pg||
nt|wstuart: Bad Madala - no Madala bicuit tonight  lol|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|jtr: Well, maybe West is prepared to play 4@h facing @hs?|pg||
nt|andyv:  and here it did help them in the OR to get to a thin game|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Landy over opponent's 1NT overcall :)|pg||
nt|mbruun: Trump lead is best for the defense. |pg||
nt|barnets: 6@H would have been better to spectate|pg||
nt|petergill: Entries are a bit awkward|pg||
nt|petergill: in 3NT|pg||
nt|Gerben42: too few high cards missing to really be in trouble though|pg||
nt|barnets: no he has 3@S 4@H a club and a few diamonds|pg||
nt|gulyas: with 12hcp, E may bid more than just 4@H|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: Maybe not|pg||
nt|hedyg: well he cannot bid NT for sure|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@s rkc in @H?|pg||
nt|cicus: the dreaded 4@S ace ask|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 4@S must be KC asking|pg||
nt|gulyas: yes|pg||
nt|bagman: As Philippe pointed out, EW can make 6@C|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|daman: this looks like -1 to me|pg||
nt|daman: 3@Ds   2@Ss and a @H|pg||
nt|athene: slightly unusual that lauria-versace passed 2@D out|pg||
nt|athene: many pairs would be in a forcing situation after doubling a 1nt overcall|pg||
nt|daman: what do you think of a double of 2@D by South?|pg||
nt|athene: it's not the same as doubling a 1nt opener (even assuming you play that as strong) because here you know your side has the balance of the points|pg||
nt|athene: i assume NS play double as takeout and north didn't fancy it with such a threadbare hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 7/12 atm Paul|pg||
nt|hedyg: my version looked politer :)|pg||
nt|petergill: The play will be interesting, I think|pg||
nt|schtsch: of course, 1nt asks for passive lead|pg||
pc|c9|nt|Walddk4: Top spot when you have a heart loser|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Losing one trick in each suit|pg||
nt|brolucius: This would normally rate as an OK game, but East's 1NT overcall means that there will be a trump loser.|pg||
nt|iceblue: 2NT is LEB, xfers to 3@C|pg||
nt|brolucius: The re-opening double gives North at least three options (clubs, NT or penalty pass).|pg||
nt|brgpro: on @s lead, N has to go up the 10 to make this|pg||
nt|jtr: I hate giving my partner options:)|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is what lazy bidding-panel members describe as a 'flexible action'. (All readers groan immediately).|pg||
nt|bagman: After 3@S it's not possible for NS to stay in 3@C and they might have to bid game as N has enough to act|pg||
nt|bagman: If North is going to lead a heart against 3NT, he should lead a low|pg||
nt|brolucius: If they use ten bids this time too, they will surely get too high.|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Okay, maybe not 2-way... lol|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He suggested that he and I have a game soon. Maybe I should accept|pg||
nt|bagman: and they have actually the highest making contract|pg||
nt|koksoy: Nederlands-Slovakya  2-0|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: The last week has been really pleasurable here, but for two days (one of which is today) where it was overcast|pg||
pc|c2|nt|pasker: Lauria is probably giving a choice between 3NT and 4@S|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 1@D did show @H apparently|pg||
nt|brolucius: If any kibitzers are thinking of logging off, to enjoy the sunshine, I am told that they will miss one of the most spectacular distributional hands of all time, later in this set.|pg||
nt|paulg:  3@d was no doubt intended as a good raise, but the diamond raise makes it sound less like one|pg||
nt|ziff:  Hand doesn t lie very well for declarer. Control may become a problem|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|Walddk4: Top spot for N-S that is, 4@C for E-W|pg||
nt|othered1: Or maybe not. Concention card says what Hedy describes in 1N box, but 1@C box says it shows outside of NT range (11-13).  So which is it?|pg||
nt|bagman: A low heart can give declarer a problem|pg||
nt|gulyas: 0-3|pg||
nt|gulyas: @HQ?|pg||
nt|hedyg: now asking about Q@H|pg||

pc|d4|nt|jtr: @d lead also gives the vital entry|pg||
nt|brgpro: and he will play @cA and @c i think|pg||
nt|brolucius: In case East or West has @CK-x-x.|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3NT+2 at the other table, I am told.|pg||

nt|Walddk2: England supporters are kindly requested not to have a look at the scoreline in the match against the Netherlands|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Half full glasses are better than the half empty ones|pg||
nt|stc: The problem here is if @c are 4-4 or not|pg||
nt|brolucius: Full glasses even better.|pg||
nt|cicus: 4@S gains in 1 out of 1000 and causes trouble on every 2nd hand|pg||
nt|gulyas: what do you mean?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: This makes sense because else 4@S by responder would be a @S cue and the strong hand would ask Aces, which doesn't make sense|pg||
nt|paulg:  I hate auctions where there is some doubt over the trump suit .. surely Denning would cue bid 5@c if he was certain about hearts?|pg||
nt|koksoy: what  is  1@C  double ??  can  it  be  majors ??|pg||

nt|petergill: If North !! ducks @CQ, does the defence have a chance?|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|atabey: they play 15-17 NT. only white against red 14-16. so their 1NT rebid there is 11-13|pg||

nt|andyv:  S certainly has a problem here with the non-forcing 3@c bid|pg||
pc|d7|nt|bagman: Sementa needs to cover the @HJ|pg||

pc|d9|nt|hedyg: N had a clear 2@d bid and 2NT over 2@s by S|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: Third hand NV vs V it's different, I suppose|pg||

nt|paulg:  Lauria and Versace seem to be playing a new defence to a strong club, based on canape overcalls|pg||
nt|andy_h: Bas, did South ask West of his preempting styles?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not Madala's set, 30 of the 31 IMPs were caused by wrong decisions |pg||

nt|Walddk2: Or we could say that 30 of the 31 IMPs to Norway came after good decisions by Brogeland|pg||
nt|brolucius: 'How did you do in your match against Italy?'  'Let me show you a deal where I got Duboin three down in 3NT'.|pg||
nt|andyv:  I was impressed|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: lol|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: "What a player"|pg||
nt|andyv:  that he is:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 3NT is not a lucky contract this session, 80% of the times it was played it went down at this table|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Zivkovic left for the bathroom|pg||
nt|hedyg: strange pass by Versace this hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: would you pass?|pg||
nt|iain sime: Despite the opening lead accidents in the other room, Italy are building a substantial lead.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Perhaps 2NT is a better response (to a double of 1@D) than 2@H was. On the previous board. Those queens and jacks may play OK in NT.|pg||
nt|hedyg: how can one not bid ever with the W hand?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Surprising, as you say.|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok Gabor, i will never discuss any blackwood or keycard with you :)|pg||
nt|gulyas: I think you should play a simpler game, cicus:) you get excited too often over simple conventions|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: This was pretty funny. Dumbovich playing @HAK and Sementa saying "@HQJ partner" in Italian. Then declarer claimed and E assumed 7@H :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|athene: next month's Bridge World may seen an article from Fred, entitled "why conventions , especially texas transfers, are ruining the modern game"|pg||

nt|bagman: The cards are really nice and NS can make DD quite a lot of tricks|pg||
nt|koksoy: I really  wonder what  was 1@C  double ??  if  its  clubs, why W didnt  raise...  if  it  was majors  NS  should know  the bad  break..  |pg||
nt|paulg:  Multi 2@d that has a 23-24 balanced option|pg||
nt|schtsch: madala thinking how crazy tesla is|pg||
mb|3S|an|*|nt|brolucius: If there are any kibitzers staggered by the 0-0 scoreline, that is because there is no coverage of the Open Room and therefore no automatic scoring. |pg||
nt|brolucius: Open room has recorded 2@H+2 on this board.|pg||
nt|paulg:  2@d is not what it appears|pg||
nt|paulg:  it is either weak or strong with hearts|pg||
nt|andyv:  very strong NT here|pg||
mb|p|nt|mbruun: Notice Sementas initial pass with 12 bal and no aces|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Anyone for a 2@D overcall by S?|pg||

nt|bagman: With @CQ dropping and diamonds running with one lead from dummy and good guess a game makes|pg||

nt|hedyg: 2@d= 5+@hs 4-18|pg||
nt|rodvenn: 2@c may be Drury or natural|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: That's true for any contract on any board, bridge is a 100% no luck game|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Contract bridge that is|pg||
nt|mamos: well  we might have forgiven Colin for doubling this one opposite a vul first in hand opener from part|pg||
nt|mamos: but then he has played with David a lot|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the NT games on 8 & 9 were a bit unlucky. the two subsequent ones were just bad contracts, even if one would rate to reach them|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i would say it is a better double than the one he actually did perpetrate|pg||
nt|skorchev: 1@D=11-17 hcp, 4+@D, unbal|pg||
nt|skorchev: 2NT = very weak or FG @D fit (tnx Rado)|pg||
nt|andyv:  this one should not be successful|pg||
pc|d9|nt|bagman: Only lead not give away anything|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: lol|pg||
nt|capercliff: easily enough from the West hand|pg||
nt|paulg:  2@d is either a weak two in hearts or 5+@H with 18+ points|pg||
nt|sharkey: Surprised W didnt bid his @S suit OR|pg||
nt|brolucius: On a similar hand yesterday, David Greenwood was saying that he prefers a 1NT rebid on that East type. It seems to be a close decision between 1NT and 2@D, but I rather like 1NT.|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@H Precision 11-15|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this time they have stretched the odds|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: N explained it as just weak with @D|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer is going to guess the trumps|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: That might be true, I'm being told no, nor the 2@C opening which would be 18-19 BAL|pg||
nt|bagman: because he can pick Qxxx from W but not from E unless he takes a direct finesse|pg||
nt|bagman: With the diamond lead it is possible that declarer plays spades from the top and relies on @C or @H|pg||
nt|iain sime: No, I would have bid 3@S. But two doubletons and an AK to lead and that is enough.|pg||
nt|andyv:  he certainly has that|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jtr: The live score service seems still down  Teething problems i guess|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 5-0 would be evil. 4-1 is just poor|pg||
nt|mbruun: OK|pg||
nt|brolucius: West would have passed 1NT, as it happens, and they would have stayed at a more comfortable level.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Giorgio Mauri|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Hello everyone from Italy|pg||
nt|andyv:  with 10 and 2 9s almost too strong|pg||
nt|mamos: does declarer need to lead @hK to make this|pg||
nt|hedyg: surely that is intended as a joke|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: lol|pg||
nt|andyv:  what they lack in strength, they make up in numbers:)|pg||
nt|corplaw: def needs to cash first 4 tricks to assure set|pg||
pc|d6|nt|hedyg: 2@c= gazzilli like|pg||
nt|jbgood: i think that is the only explanation - 2 @c shows 3 card Major support and 8 +(and never clubs)|pg||
nt|jbgood: if clubs, 2 NT is a transfer to that suit|pg||
nt|andy_h: One benefit of playing this is that you don't need another route to show a 3 card limit raise, but the downside of it is that it can hurt the tempo of your 2/1 auctions if it ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: happens to be a GF|pg||
nt|hedyg: now 5@c by S?|pg||
nt|hedyg: he really wants to protect the K@s|pg||
nt|stc: 800 available but hard to collect|pg||
nt|iain sime: 5@D ?|pg||
nt|hedyg: useless K@S...|pg||
nt|skorchev: yes, since he is passed hand, the GF option is hardly possible|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: What would 3@D and 4|pg||

nt|paulg:  doubleton @cQ is about the only option to make it|pg||
pc|d7|nt|Walddk2: 12 IMPs away when NL settled for 3NT|pg||
nt|dougdscsu: Italy now down 2-0|pg||
nt|dougdscsu: in the world cup|pg||
nt|hedyg: sry it is 4-9 or 18+|pg||
nt|capercliff: tell them at the table Bas?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I signaled it|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|atabey: for the turkish spectators: our women team is up 46-1 for now. I thk against the chech republic|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@c= good hand @S+@C|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I believe England lost a swing to Ireland last night when trumps broke 5-0 in a 6@C contract   |pg||
nt|brolucius: South must look for a card to suggest a diamond switch.|pg||
nt|bagman: He needs the doubleton @CQ |pg||
nt|petergill: in @S|pg||
nt|petergill: Pardon me, I am tired, it is late here|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: np Peter :)|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|othered1: Tis is pushy, but good @H spots and other good views may pull this through|pg||
nt|hedyg: only 2@H tricks|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@ds, 4@cs on a good guess|pg||
nt|hedyg: that is only 8|pg||
nt|bagman: In isolation the spade play should be @SK and then finesse(s)|pg||
nt|mbruun: Yes I remember not a sound overcall with a boring 5332 and a bad suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Silence was golden for Muller in the other room|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He passed in a flash|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In order not to risk further penalties|pg||
pc|cA|nt|marlowepi: as S has no 4th D, E is in control|pg||
nt|hedyg: if i would bid 2NT opps would take the 1st 5 @ss|pg||
nt|gulyas: I like the way this match goes - some pushes, some doubledigit swings to Hungary, some more pushes:)|pg||
pc|c6|nt|snetram:  remis|pg||
nt|hedyg: no entry to dummy|pg||
nt|stc: yes but if they play twice @c and @h S is endplay after the @d ruff|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes.|pg||
nt|skorchev: 3@D would be to play and 4@D some kind of invite, I guess|pg||
nt|andyv:  3|pg||
pc|c3|nt|hedyg: OR same 3NT|pg||
nt|bagman: There are some chances for a 2nd trump trick for S|pg||
nt|frululu: and wd|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: NL and Russia lost 3VPs each yesterday for slow play|pg||
nt|bagman: With the setting trick in his hand S might have considered cashing it but there's really no way that the @HA can run away|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Vanuzzi has taken a bathroom break|pg||
nt|babs59: Italy gained again when North treated her red 5/5 as a multi 2|pg||
nt|babs59: so they played in 3@D rather than 3NT|pg||
nt|babs59: sensible treatment when you have multis - the singleton @SQ downgrades|pg||
pc|c4|nt|mamos: what if South had won Ace and played Diamond?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: lol Daniel|pg||
nt|athene: i guess 2NT is showing a good diamond suit  because 1@D can't have more than 17 points|pg||
nt|hedyg: try to sound impartial Daniel :)|pg||
nt|gulyas: sry, I hope u understand I root for my team|pg||
nt|cicus: he is just doing it, Hedy :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: a bit obvious |pg||
pc|cK|nt|hedyg: same lead|pg||
nt|atabey: confirmed by the audiance. turkey 46 czech republic 1. for now. ladies match|pg||
nt|brolucius: Important to pick up every available trick in defence when opponents have 650 in the bag already.|pg||
pc|cT|nt|Vugraphznk: I am sorry, I lost play here, I'll claim the correct amount of tricks|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok|pg||
nt|hedyg: did Zorlu play another @d?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Yes and declarer played the @Cs right|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok ty|pg||
nt|atabey: then its -1|pg||
nt|atabey: at least -1 I mean|pg||
nt|atabey: still a small swing for italy|pg||
nt|hedyg: Kandemir misguessed the @c and Madala switched to ..............10@s!|pg||
nt|othered1: Defense in other room was merciless after declarer misguessed @C|pg||
nt|andy_h: So, E-W seem to have handled the interference well as one generally needs to be prepared if you play any type of relay sequences|pg||
nt|xenya: it would be interesting to see 2@DXX -- but with S's diamond holding the chances of that are almost non-existent |pg||
nt|rodvenn: Brogeland played 3 times diamonds. Which must be the right defense|pg||
nt|wstuart: good def|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|bogier: wszystko przez ocene K karo, który wydaje sie kiepski- a jest swietny|pg||
nt|bagman: He needs diamonds to run with one play from dummy|pg||
nt|ziff:  I have done comments on Australian events, I know how you feel :)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|capercliff: well done:)|pg||
nt|bagman: South tries for 2 down|pg||
pc|h4|nt|brolucius: N/S play reverse count signals, so Bocchi has shown two hearts.|pg||
nt|brgpro: he has to duck again to give himself a chance although declarer can play @s and make this anyways|pg||
nt|andyv:  3@d probably invite... who knows what 4@d would be|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@H showed 3 spades (not 4) and not 4@D|pg||
pc|hA|nt|rodvenn: If North has the J9 of trumps, the contract is down|pg||
nt|iain sime: Cracked it!|pg||
nt|stc: oops, a new communication opened|pg||
nt|hedyg: oy!|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Was 5 originally, but an appeal gave both teams 2 VPs back|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|brolucius: Against a high heart to request a diamond switch.|pg||
nt|hedyg: K@H was a mistake |pg||
nt|koksoy: diamond VDKA|pg||
nt|bagman: This is the only layout, otherwise defense wins|pg||
nt|bagman: if @D9 is doubleton, the defense can take the @DA|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|mamos: had another chance|pg||
pc|sA|nt|rodvenn: and if he has the Jack +x declarer may make a mistake|pg||
nt|andyv:  eventually he will lead trump|pg||
nt|koksoy:  then  try for droping  @D9  (not finesse )  because he  has heart finesse as  well|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The equation is simple now, although no doubt South expects the spade finesse to fail|pg||
nt|pasker: should be ok for +1 now|pg||

nt|barnets: bad heart split bears 4@S here|pg||
nt|petergill: Yes Bas, very fast. I think Latvia was fined 1VP in Round 1, but not this time|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Translating might prove challenging|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Although we saw a pretty good translation of the Lithuanian system notes earlier this week :)|pg||
nt|cicus: hey, what's that alert, Bas|pg||
nt|athene: i think any modern player should be able to say "sorry, partner" in any language|pg||
nt|skorchev: double @H finesse is his best chance - 25% .... he could slightly improve drawing @SAK wating for @SQJ doubleton, but then he would be short of entries to finesse @HS twice|pg||
nt|paulg:  2@c shows the majors|pg||
nt|corplaw: chance for another swing if croatia gets to slam|pg||
nt|schtsch: now relay auction|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Many distinguish between garbage (2@D) and constructive (2M)|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@D Precision, 11-15|pg||
mb|1S!|nt|hedyg: take away his bidding box?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Yes, when the opps generally play slower than you it can be a pretty powerful weapon|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: It takes a lot of experience (which EW obviously have) to keep your own pace|pg||
nt|rodvenn: Madala seem not to be up to the standard of Brogeland yet. But he is young|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 25 I think|pg||
nt|bagman: I have no idea if it makes but let's see if EW bid it|pg||
nt|bogier: sytuacja nie jest taka prosta|pg||
nt|andyv:  NS can make 3@h|pg||
nt|pasker: S may have been tempted to open the bidding holding 2 aces and a king|pg||
nt|andyv:  S needs to get in the bidding|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1Nt isn't forcing|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @D multi,  wk 2 in a major |pg||
nt|barnets: easy for south to play a heart to satop any endplay|pg||
nt|athene: it's something you might need at any moment :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: rehi all. small hiccup there|pg||
nt|petergill: Dbl by the passed hand suggests both majors|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: you do a great job! my favorite operator :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Thanks :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: lol, that means a lot, given the amount of sessions I've seen you commentate, haha|pg||
nt|capercliff: that wasnt really a slow pass was it?|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|Walddk2: Gazzilli I presume|pg||
nt|mbruun: Sp K is huge, but still 1 NT is stretchy|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: No, it wasn't|pg||
nt|capercliff: tx|pg||
nt|paulg:  of course the Scottish expectations for this match will be low so Piper does have free rein to try for a result|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I just figured that with all my typing I might as well enter the bidding real life when I'm typing :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: why did he pass?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Wasn't he the 15 year old wonder boy 10 years ago?|pg||
nt|bogier: ktr mog³aby doprowadziæ do sytuacji ¿e N podejmowa³by decyzjê na poziomie 4|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, for promotion, but he can do that no matter which trump trick he wins|pg||
nt|mamos: ah yes  he just didnt do it |pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: There is some kind of socialist festival going on outside with loud music, fire crackers and a small carnival|pg||
nt|brolucius: Some players use a new major at the two-level (facing a weak two-bid of some sort) to be invitational but non-forcing. In that way they can pick up the games where there is a fit ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: for responder's suit. A new suit at the three-level is forcing.|pg||
nt|petergill: Interesting (disciplined?) that Sementa chooses 3@D raise rather than direct 4@S|pg||
nt|petergill: I expected North to bid 5@C|pg||
nt|paulg:  Shields bids 2@s so that he can compete in hearts on the next round ... if there were one|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|dougdscsu: really dont like pass with Piper's hand, hes got 9 hcp and support for partners suit..|pg||
nt|paulg:  i'm sure it was an 'action' pass|pg||
nt|andy_h: Looks like a swing for norway here|pg||
nt|brolucius: Neither East rates his hand as worth a 2@D bid to show a sound raise to 2@H. No, but it is around a maximum for the direct raise.|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@H is 7+|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I am being told Finnish and Hungarian have a shared ancestry, there you go kids, don't believe what you're being told :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  Italy chipping away at the lead with 2 imp gains on boards 7 and 8|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|Walddk2: 2@C either natural or any 16+|pg||
nt|bogier: troche zamieszania- Cezary walczy z w³asn¹ intuicj¹, która podpowiada³a mu skrecic w BA|pg||
nt|bagman: If @SK were wrong and the clubs very badly, declarer got from the lead a heart trick for his 10th trick|pg||
nt|mamos: perfect playing conditions for bridge|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I am sorry, sometimes bid don't register properly...|pg||
nt|cicus: that theory is already refuted|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: That's only proving my last point :)|pg||
nt|athene: if this auction was forced on EW by system it's not a great advertisement for polish club 1@C opener in competition, i don't think|pg||
nt|schtsch: noone will understand it but it could get them to slam|pg||
nt|schtsch: 1@s positive|pg||
nt|schtsch: 1nt relay|pg||
nt|schtsch: he bid balanced hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 2@H natural but denies 8+hcp|pg||
nt|capercliff: he might double if they reach 5@d?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: he is only 23 I hear, born 1987|pg||
nt|bagman: There were entry problems to go for that line and set up 3 heart tricks|pg||
nt|hedyg: as usual the @c suit got lost|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer is playing close to DD|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Sorry all, the OR crashed so we had to reestablish the link|pg||
nt|wstuart: this is a tough one. 2 controlish hands with the right doubletons opposite length in the other hand|pg||
mb|3H!|nt|andy_h: The 2@S opening did its job, with the 3@S adding more preemptive value|pg||
nt|lesniak: oczywiscie wist w trefla kladaie 3 ba ale kto to wymysli|pg||
nt|antoniz: please heart lead|pg||
nt|brolucius: And the @D suit.|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Don't NS play weak 2's?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Or did Madala judge it as too bad|pg||
nt|barnets: same contract|pg||
nt|petergill: North does not like to use the Pass Card unless he has to|pg||
nt|paulg:  as it happens, the double fit means that they have missed game|pg||
nt|koksoy: and  2@D  seems  natural...  because he  prefered to  bid 2@S  with  4-4  major|pg||
nt|bagman: Sementa's going to play a trump now|pg||
nt|schtsch: 3@d obviously his shape|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 3@C natural, NF|pg||
nt|bagman: here there are 3 top tricks to lose and then declarer has to guess the trumps (which he will after this lead)|pg||
nt|antoniz: dobrze Rysiu:)|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: pañskie zyczenie jest rozkazem|pg||
nt|vasmar: E-W can make 3@D|pg||
nt|hedyg: not 2suiters, no|pg||
nt|petergill: Bas - when in doubt, assume that Ozols did not pass?|pg||
nt|athene: if east really has to jump all the way to 3nt just to show the strong hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  great dummy for N|pg||
mb|3S!|nt|hedyg: 2@H is wow|pg||
nt|paulg:  might double 3N|pg||
nt|hedyg: specs suggest he cannot play the hand if he raises |pg||
nt|capercliff: or 3N for a @s lead?|pg||
nt|mamos: 3NT was good i was just going to say   but  .....|pg||
nt|brolucius: Six cards, 4-10 points, on their card.|pg||
nt|hedyg: but E could have bid 2@d here|pg||

nt|andyv:  2@h was polish in OR on board 8... showed 5@h and 5 of other....5-11 hcp... she was max for her bid|pg||
nt|schtsch: 3@h asking controls or something|pg||
nt|wstuart: Does anyone know exactly what Croatia needs in this match to advance?|pg||
nt|schtsch: don't know their system, just guessing|pg||
nt|schtsch: 27:3 :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: So 16-18 with spades and clubs|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Is there a brake pedal to this auction?|pg||
nt|sybarra: nice of @S's to be 3/3|pg||
nt|mbruun: North will probably lead a diamond against a spade contract, and the 3-3 break combined with good intermediates allows it to make|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Sementa could have passed 3@C|pg||
nt|mdgraham: he could have passed 1@S too|pg||
nt|mbruun: With a nondiamond lead declarer lacks an entry|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Indeed|pg||
nt|capercliff: 4@h is a good contract|pg||
nt|dougdscsu: still hope for italy, 2-1 now|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Thanks|pg||
nt|capercliff: and maybe 6@d on any lead other than a @h|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Won't tell him until the contract is over, dw Scots :)|pg||
nt|xenya: and a huge one|pg||
nt|bagman: Then, on the other hand, declarer might have lost a spade and two clubs with the heart|pg||
nt|stc: -5 possible|pg||
nt|hedyg: now J@C|pg||
nt|hedyg: well, only 50/ trick|pg||
mb|4C!|nt|brolucius: Declarer must take steps to avoid two trump losers. Ace and low to the jack will work.|pg||
nt|brolucius: He can afford that safety play only when he knows that there are only two losers in the side suits.|pg||
nt|brolucius: With three side-suit losers he would have to play the A-K, hoping to drop a doubleton queen.|pg||
nt|atabey: very good pass by assael. could be a cold 4@h|pg||
nt|hedyg: did we miss out a double Bas?|pg||
nt|bagman: They are on their way. West seems to think that diamonds are solid (and they are :) )|pg||
nt|marlowepi: after the king of hearts drops the queen from N, there is a good case for swtiching tacks and knocking out the ace of clubs. you want to take the entry out of the hand that has the ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: long diamonds|pg||
nt|mamos: Pric wants more|pg||
nt|sybarra: but spades are 3/3 |pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: can he get the pitches |pg||
nt|athene: i suppose it's ok if it shows something really specific|pg||

nt|othered1: Note that Duboin stayed out of the auction, despite vulnerability.  West's action in OR bought -800, abetted by east.|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: *is|pg||
pc|c8|nt|Walddk2: and Marc Smith. That could be fun|pg||
nt|brolucius: Consider yourself invited (after the world cup is over).|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer is going to take his finesses in the majors and ends up with 10 or 11 tricks|pg||
nt|bagman: A spade to the 9 now?|pg||
nt|bagman: and then heart?|pg||
nt|paulg:  hard to believe that the cards could lie so well|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 3@S is not in any way invitational is it?  So is North allowed to bid 4@S?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Something is an underbid|pg||
nt|antoniz: dobrze idzie|pg||
nt|pasker: that lead should help|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|iain sime: Should be 1100  |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Everyone knows hos the cards lie in a second|pg||
nt|Walddk2: (no club)|pg||
nt|hedyg: he might regret that J@S|pg||
nt|athene: yes i didn't mean makeable necessarily i mean they might get bid|pg||
nt|cicus: I wonder why W overtook, he could have gone to hand with a @D|pg||
nt|athene: i am told france brought home 6@S|pg||
nt|schtsch: with only 2VPs available for croatia here|pg||
pc|h4|nt|vasmar: there was a safe heart lead for N |pg||
pc|h2|nt|Walddk2: Thank you|pg||
nt|petergill:  1 is Fulvio Fantoni, pushed up by his World Pairs win in 2002|pg||
pc|hA|nt|hedyg: if 2NT could be this weak E had no business bidding 5@d|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@d by N in OR was unusual vs unusual|pg||
nt|othered1: Maybe they don't have a narrow range for the action at this vul and east was taking a general direction shot.  But double of 3@D might bring partner back in on the right hand.|pg||
nt|hedyg: France is killing Lithuania, so far 51:1 after 13 bds|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the lead help|pg||
nt|bagman: Now this is more or less over. declarer has many ways for 10 tricks and some for 11|pg||
nt|brolucius: Madala is looking around for an Undo button. 'Sorry, I don't know what happened. Obviously I meant to pass over 5@D.'|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|stc: E has better majors|pg||
nt|stc: As I heard on BBO:"my daughter bounced my arm"|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: lol|pg||
nt|hedyg: cannot use that excuse in Ostend|pg||
nt|brolucius: Mind you, who can say that 5@H was wrong? He could have ended up being a hero if the North and East hands were adjusted a bit.|pg||
nt|hedyg: 56:1 sry|pg||
nt|cicus: now has to settle for 11 tricks as a @H ruff would make N's @S87 a trick|pg||
nt|jkotor: szansa na -2|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer's best chance to make the contract is the same as playing for max|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|paulg:  this is an important match for Wales as they are currently lying 9th in the standings and the last qualifying spot, just 8VPs clear of tenth|pg||
nt|marlowepi: these two countries both claim nationality credit for Marco Polo|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mamos: I still think that transfer is their defence to strong Club (which Simpson Price are not playing)|pg||

nt|xenya: good @D switch -- Italy is likely to pick 2 imps here|pg||
nt|andy_h: Not much to this hand. Declarer's thinking suggests that he is trying to protect against any foul breaks which is what you want to do in case it happens|pg||
nt|bagman: The @CA is marked south|pg||
nt|bagman: So is the @SK with some confidence|pg||
pc|s5|nt|bjacobs: Suspect the problem is the 2@S bid|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I play Gametry XX here, so 3@S is just stonewalling opps|pg||
nt|Gerben42: also Italian - they have a lot of players to pick from|pg||
pc|s4|nt|sybarra: maybe they play it over any club|pg||

pc|sA|pg||
nt|jtr: Looks like this is going to drift a few off at least|pg||
nt|othered1: And AKxx of their likely trumps is a lot better for defense than offense.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If they are married, as Mike suggested in the beginning, he will hear about it all evening and night|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And Sementa finds a truly evil defensive play, putting South under all sorts of pressure|pg||
nt|sybarra: I suspect they have sorted this out much earlier than now |pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I think they are btw, same rings though she has it on her right hand and he on his left|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer has quite a good count of the hand and can go for the line to make 11 tricks|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Anyone for some ping pong?|pg||
nt|hedyg: good defense by E|pg||
nt|Walddk2: N and W might just as well fold their cards|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: OR seems to be playing in 3@C|pg||
nt|brolucius: A conservative assessment.|pg||
nt|bagman: Playing 5@C, what would you do on a diamond lead?|pg||
nt|pasker: N may open 3@D here and is likely to play there|pg||
nt|bagman: Might W X?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: may South pass ? :)|pg||
nt|athene: north had better not do something silly like lead away from a king on opening lead|pg||
nt|paulg:  They are a very small bridge nation and it would be a first|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: The boards certainly haven't been boring!|pg||
nt|babs59: except Norway Germany is only board 8!|pg||
nt|petergill: North has redoubled, so full credit to Alfredo Versace for not reopening|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you might try 2NTas South, but it's only 9 hcp, and the singleton heart isn't exactly a bonus|pg||
nt|ahri: Sementa was out of blue cards.|pg||
nt|schtsch: great result for croatia in open|pg||

nt|babs59: often it's the negative after overcalls|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 6@C is a maker here because @SK is onside and @ST9 stiff, I think|pg||
nt|corplaw: EW can make 2C; don't know why sementa ran from that|pg||

nt|andyv:  W has easy @s lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  and can probably switch to @d without much ado|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: Never mind me, I counted 9 @Cs|pg||

nt|brgpro: well, versace did the same but Lauria just gave it a try then signed off when pd said so|pg||

nt|brolucius: Again it must be West thinking at this point. The bids are made in pairs, each side of the screen.|pg||
nt|bogier: system kanape?|pg||
nt|athene: i imagine the way to make this is get the clubs going fast for diamond discards|pg||

nt|brolucius: Not a very good game to hope to slip through when facing Italy.|pg||

nt|mdgraham: If 3NT was a "serious" slam try, 4@S looks an underbid, but perhaps there is more to this than that |pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: EW discussing in Italian, sounds like an opera lol|pg||
nt|bagman: West had a very marginal T/O X by passed hand. With the @DQ changed to @HQ, he would have doubled, I think|pg||

mb|p|nt|bagman: This removes the entry to @DK|pg||
nt|bagman: Unless declarer wins it with the @SA|pg||

nt|corplaw: where more than 2 teams have same number of VP, tie will be decided by result of the matches between those teams.  If one of those teams has defeated all othe other teams involved, ...|pg||
nt|corplaw: it will be ranked ahead regardless of number of VPs obtained.|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Italy would not want their "5" match to count for Carryover and some 20+ matches to be excluded, I doubt they're intentionally dumping|pg||
nt|wstuart: however, there has been a fair amount of thought given to tournament formats which reduce the incentive/ability for "Sportsmanlike Dumping".|pg||
nt|marlowepi: croatia has offered to share the Glagolitic script with Italy in exchange for 30 IMPs|pg||
nt|schtsch: there is a carryover so no dumping is good|pg||
nt|corplaw: push on this board|pg||
nt|wstuart: An excellent article was written on thsi subject in the Bridge World roughly 7 years agio which I would refer folks to if they wanted to pursue this topic further.|pg||

nt|hedyg: other room didnt have the 2@d at their disposal|pg||
nt|sharkey: agree Pekka - 3@C more of a "coffee" hand|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Bas probably flirting with the Lavazza girls and got distracted|pg||

nt|babs59: what's the time for you?|pg||
nt|babs59: 3am?|pg||
nt|andyv:  3:15am|pg||
nt|babs59: West is just deciding whether the spades can cash|pg||
nt|babs59: either that or she's stressing South?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: That's dedication Andy|pg||
nt|andyv:  with that suit in dummy?|pg||

nt|petergill: Well stopped, with the five level being very dangerous |pg||
pc|s6|nt|vugraphznk: Roland has eyes everywhere...|pg||
nt|athene: hard for west to duck the club perhaps but it would have made things harder for declarer |pg||
nt|daman: a@H play now might be fatal|pg||
nt|athene: declarer now has some transportation to untangle his black tricks|pg||
nt|athene: four clubs, two spades, and the red aces is still only eight though|pg||
nt|athene: double dummy he can make quite easily by dropping the @HJ of course|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@s showed 2 keycards and cuebid in @s|pg||
nt|paulg:  nice contract but potential gain of 2 imps if Scotland bid the inferior 6@s|pg||
nt|hedyg: a lauria speciality|pg||

nt|bogier: znowu przed [parti¹|pg||

nt|brolucius: Madala has had enough of making risky heart bids.|pg||
nt|hedyg: pay-back time |pg||
nt|bogier: spryciarz|pg||
nt|paulg:  Madala and Bocchi bidding every possible game at the moment and finding a perfect lie of the cards|pg||
nt|bagman: Now the rest is about overtricks|pg||
nt|babs59: so at trick 2 she took another 10 minutes!|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|brolucius: Yes, he has always been interested in coffee.|pg||
nt|jtr: But usually focussed on Lavazza girls|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|bagman: I think that Madala made up his mind about the hearts|pg||
nt|rodvenn: it surely must  be reight to save a tick. Well done charlsen|pg||
nt|rodvenn: trick|pg||
nt|gulyas: maybe he should play on @Ds|pg||
nt|cicus: hmm, this was not urgent|pg||
nt|gulyas: do they lead 4th best?|pg||
nt|hedyg: he was in dummy, what should he play?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: NS lead odd|pg||
pc|dT|nt|athene: heart to the @HQ and @HK|pg||
nt|athene: and now it looks percentage to finesse the ten|pg||
nt|daman: yes|pg||
nt|athene: unblock @SK first|pg||
nt|athene: still lauria has a bit of a habit of making these contracts, so let's see....|pg||
nt|athene: Lauria might suspect that west has the @HK|pg||
nt|athene: otherwise why no heart back after the @CK>|pg||
nt|athene: ?|pg||
nt|athene: but even if he knew that, i don't see how it would really help that much|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps he will cash the @SK then run the clubs and judge whether to exit @SA, spade|pg||
nt|Walddk2: apart from the overtrick of course|pg||
nt|babs59: THAT was tough to remain focused|pg||
pc|d4|nt|Walddk2: Bas will insert result on 16 when he gets a minute. Please be patient|pg||
pc|d3|nt|jtr: Now maybe an overtrick?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that's a relief, then|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That's a "half is glass full" theory Roland by the look of it|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@d would have been 1 or 4, not showing cue in @d|pg||
nt|bagman: hoping that partner has 2 trump tricks|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|brgpro: he will get one for sure|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you don't want too many good results like this, though|pg||
nt|andyv:  one specs chimes in with they've been told not to double.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Bridge World has been discussing this issue for decades i believe|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|athene: interesting he didn't unblock the spade - now a club return is very bad surely|pg||
nt|bagman: I cannot believe that Tesla ducked the diamond to the danger hand|pg||
pc|h6|nt|pasker: S can then play the 4th round of clubs to promote his 7 of trumps|pg||
pc|h2|nt|gulyas: he can play on @Ds|pg||
nt|cicus: well, yes, @H and @D was equal chance|pg||
nt|hedyg: they lead 3/5 and attitude|pg||
nt|gulyas: I know, I can see all hands|pg||
nt|andyv:  looks like that happened here too|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|koksoy: they  had  more  then   1.0  butler   ranking  a  few  matches  ago|pg||
pc|h3|nt|sharkey: shud make|pg||
nt|bagman: Now 2x diamonds, @CT and club|pg||
nt|brolucius: Trump promotion.|pg||
nt|sharkey: kib says no..|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes|pg||
pc|h8|nt|kiwi_joker: well, just goes to show. Madala the Magician strikes again|pg||
nt|brolucius: You can risk 3@H on some hands with a suit like that, but a bit dodgy with 3-2-2 on the side.|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|athene: ok, no reason to get that right|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|bagman: ruff!|pg||

nt|hedyg: no|pg||
nt|hedyg: oh yes sry , 9@c in N|pg||
nt|athene: he can still make if he reads the position|pg||
nt|gulyas: N has an entry to the high @H|pg||
nt|athene: although NS have done well to organise the clubs so south doesn't get endplayed|pg||
nt|cicus: but what does S discard?|pg||
nt|athene: yes but if you exit a heart now, what does south throw?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: If he plays @SA @S, he'll have 2@S and 2@D + 5 = 9?|pg||
nt|athene: south is squeezed in three suits|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: Director has been called|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Apparently Bocchi held the @s9 before leading a @D|pg||
nt|Walddk2: what now?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Hofta called the TD|pg||
nt|andy_h: held or led?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Did his partner see @S9?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: According to Bocchi he held, according to Hofta he put it on the table, the tray was closed at the time|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: The tray was only opened after the @D lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So what is the problem?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Chaos describes it aptly atm|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Tray = screen|pg||
nt|andy_h: if the screen was closed then there should not be a problem at all. This is one of the main advantages of playing behind screens!|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: According to Hoffa, Bocchi almost put down the @S9, he wanted to put dummy down and then Bocchi changed the card|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So facts are disputed|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It happens|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I, personally, didn't see a card before the @D|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I'm not sure if Bocchi has disputed showing the @S9 as a lead to Hofta|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In those situations, the TD *can* ask a spectator if he so wishes, but it rarely happens|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: He did|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bas is a spectator in this context|pg||
nt|rodvenn: this is being discussed now in the press rooms with very good expert TDs present|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Please kibs, I am impartial in this, I'm only reporting what I see and hear at the table, I have no hidden agenda|pg||
nt|rodvenn: they think the 9 of @s may be a playd card|pg||

nt|hedyg: i ignored the 9@c in N|pg||

nt|paulg:  1@h seems normal .. 3-5 majors too diverse for double|pg||

nt|hedyg: yes|pg||
nt|brolucius: This is a deal where 10 Italian bids may pay off.|pg||

nt|bagman: played for the drop|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the best result is 4@D dbl less 1 = -100|pg||
nt|pasker: I think W was likely to bid at all vulnerabilities|pg||
nt|bagman: Here my suggestion did not help N|pg||
nt|brolucius: There have been some instructive bidding boards. Perhaps the most valuable lesson is that you should not take a gamble that is destined to lose.|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@D= a major suit|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|nt|brolucius: I wonder how many teams contain a sponsor. The round-robin format makes that a more difficult proposition than it would be in such as the Bermuda Bowl. That is one reason why the ...|pg||

nt|andy_h: 1NT = (14)15-17|pg||

nt|sharkey: Canape style OR may have complicated matters|pg||
nt|petergill: A spec wisely pointed out that 12-15 is too wide as a 1NT range = very good point - that was part of the problem|pg||

nt|stc: The so-called MultiLandy, very more and more popular|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2NT is four card heart raise|pg||
nt|bagman: Philosophical question, with a hand that bad as S has, showing 12 cards instead of 5 with a single call might be a good policy|pg||
nt|petergill: North did well to bid 3@H opposite 14-16|pg||
nt|mdgraham: won't matter here, but you can play transfers after that sort of overcall, to get the stroing NT hand being declarer.|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: S has too much to pass :(|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: An other argument of the Italians was that Hoffa should've called the TD before the screen was opened if he felt wronged|pg||
nt|brolucius: South's 2@H was to play in partner's major. That is why North did not pass - South had not shown hearts.|pg||
nt|hedyg: @d lead and a @C back?|pg||
nt|iain sime: Woolsey I think is another name for it.|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I always thought the only difference between ML and Cappeletti is the reverse of 2m (2@C in Cap is the 2@D in ML), is that true?|pg||

mb|p|nt|brolucius: Only one win, I think.|pg||
nt|rodvenn: What the experts say here is that the fact that the screen is down does not automatically give Bocchi the right to change.  |pg||
nt|Walddk2: No|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I've seen players change cards and calls behind screens, I'm not sure if that's in accordance with the rules though|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes Iain, depending which side of the water you are on :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2@C used with only 3 trumps|pg||
pc|c7|nt|hedyg: lucky 3NT with no entry to the W hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes and another hand with little to comment on|pg||
nt|babs59: yes correct - but I guess you can correct the score for us?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: There is no reason to|pg||
nt|marlowepi: at the point where heart queen was led, it was not unreasonable to play small. he had to take pitch earlier|pg||
nt|wstuart: lol|pg||
nt|corplaw: contract cold for 7 on 4-2 diamonds|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes|pg||
pc|cK|nt|bjacobs: He isn't, but if partner is moving away from NT, Duboin will agree |pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: If E did intend 3@H to let W choose, W didn't take it that way|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Why not?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Didn't he choose?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: He just said 3@H probably was half a stop|pg||
nt|bjacobs: oh|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Denying 4@S anyway|pg||
nt|andy_h: But that doesn't refrain them from the 1NT opening - they also have another edge, that is, it is pre-emptive. If you hover your mouse to the open room score on the top-left, you ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: can see the auction from the Open Room. Versace also opened it 1NT|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Usually, when a player decides to allow/disallow a screenmate to change a call/card, it's dependant on personal relations|pg||
nt|sharkey: not sure - but West's raise to game seems very conservative|pg||
nt|Gerben42: even have time to let the strong hand play it|pg||
nt|cicus: another struggle for 9 tricks is coming|pg||
nt|bagman: MIght treat that Kxxxx as a 4-carder|pg||
pc|c3|nt|hedyg: why not bid 2NT?|pg||
nt|daman: good bidding|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Oh well, it was a fine auction, even if a misunderstanding|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: 4@H-1 is the match score|pg||
nt|andyv:  it looks like NS agreed to -1|pg||
pc|s7|nt|vasmar: now diamond lost|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: There's actually a VG theatre here, but it's well isolated from the playing area :)|pg||
nt|stc: yes, but Multilandy better, because selfdescribing|pg||
nt|lesniak: fajnie zaczyna bal- prowokuje do grania w atu|pg||
nt|petergill: as long as you are not the sort of people who forget your system |pg||
pc|s5|nt|Walddk2: But as I understand it, N and E don't agree as to whether @S9 had been played or not. Anyway, that's why we have TDs; it's for them to sort out|pg||
nt|bagman: bad minors and bad shape|pg||
nt|antoniz: karo proszê,a widzisz wiara czyni cuda:)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Dbl by lauria at 2@s is a raise in @D in decent hand|pg||
nt|bagman: North did not support so surprise attac might work. And now it does|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer has 9 tricks, though|pg||
nt|paulg:  with the marked heart finesse|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|hedyg: in OR W passed and left th bidding open for opps|pg||
nt|brolucius: In Turkey-Switzerland there was a noble push in 6@S bid and made.|pg||
nt|babs59: I thought you said both sides agreed to -2, Bas|pg||
pc|cT|nt|andyv:  a fast claimer... could actually make 4 if he believes E's dbl showed @hs|pg||
pc|c5|nt|bjacobs: Could that lead divert Sementa?  (Thinking it's a singleton ...)|pg||
nt|xenya: so NS have set up a 2nd trick in spades -- 2 down now|pg||

pc|s2|nt|bagman: Push by NS?|pg||

pc|s9|nt|petergill: Yes it was|pg||

nt|lesniak: moze tak naprawde trza bylo grac|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer needs to cash the @DA now|pg||
pc|c9|nt|othered1: I'd have no choice on north's hand -- getting my long suit into the auction is paramount.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The TD will give a ruling at some point and inform the two sides about their right to bring his decision before an appeals committee within a stipulated time frame|pg||

nt|bagman: and the rest is easy: take 3 heart tricks and @SA|pg||

nt|bagman: No heart lead now|pg||
nt|brolucius: Bold double by South.|pg||
nt|hedyg: S led A@H in OR and switched to the A@c!|pg||

nt|petergill: the "or forever hold your peace" bit, I mean|pg||
nt|barnets: needs very good defense to beat this contract|pg||

nt|snetram:  zÅa czÄÅciÃ³wka pary B-N|pg||

mb|p|nt|brolucius: East can see that playing the jack will not assist his side's prospects.|pg||

nt|daman: 3NT loos like the par contract on this one|pg||
nt|daman: looks*|pg||
nt|daman: 2@C = Gazzilli|pg||

nt|schtsch: @h10 is well positioned|pg||
nt|corplaw: making 3N will put croatia at 24-6 for match; |pg||
pc|h3|nt|bagman: N has troubles if they play odd=encouraging on the diamond switch|pg||
nt|petergill: Ew have few losers, but they lack tricks - 5@D on non trump leads might make 2 H's, 1 @C and 8 @D's I guess|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@H is interesting too|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Duboin: "Disgusting"|pg||
nt|babs59: yes - needs to ruff out the @CA too|pg||
nt|andyv:  pretty easy from here|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|daman: 2@S = 19-21|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|Gerben42: heh|pg||
nt|cicus: S had a chance to X|pg||
pc|d2|nt|daman: 3NT = 5@S  4@C and not 3 @Hs|pg||
nt|iain sime: Bro Paolo would have made 12 ? :)|pg||
nt|bagman: without the trump lead declarer ruffs 2 spades and loses a trump trick in the process|pg||
pc|d9|nt|bridge_one: and @c|pg||
nt|Gerben42: what can he do|pg||
nt|barnets: if he can make 5@H tricks 4@D and a club |pg||
nt|barnets: seems a lot|pg||
nt|Gerben42: esp the combination of making 5@H and getting the @D through|pg||
nt|barnets: with the @D 4-1|pg||
nt|barnets: if the diamonds split|pg||
nt|petergill: The play looks complex - I hope the defence do not let Duboin's reaction affect their concentration (i.e. make them assume that the contract is hopeless)|pg||
nt|barnets: would have better chance|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|othered1: On @H lead, don't you get @H pitch on @S?|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|hedyg: ohhhhh N didnt split his @s honours!|pg||
pc|d7|nt|bogier: z " O" PC ciê¿ko cos wyci¹gn¹æ w licytacji|pg||
nt|pasker: S will need to play a @H through at some point to avoid N being potentially endplayed|pg||
nt|athene: a trump or club ace would keep them alive, but spade is normal|pg||
pc|d6|nt|daman: this is a Roland slam which just might come home   even with the bad trumps|pg||
nt|bagman: anyhow, this is going to be double digit swing for Italy|pg||
nt|Gerben42: if you can ruff 4@S in dummy and @D 3-2 you would get 6 or 7 @H perhaps|pg||
nt|petergill: I predict 4@h will fail and will take a very very long time to be played|pg||
nt|Gerben42: he will try that I guess|pg||
nt|cicus: dangerous though it may have been|pg||
nt|athene: double of 3@D would have worked very well, yes :)|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jtr: I rather prefer the 1NT rebid by South What do you think?|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|brolucius: He was obviously considering it. No idea, really, which is better.|pg||
nt|jtr: Limits the hand and has nice honour holdings to be led round to|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes.|pg||
nt|brolucius: You have persuaded me.|pg||
nt|jtr: Damn I was hoping to get you into an arguement:)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Discuss it with David Burn if that is what you want...|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: Haha, I see where you're coming from David|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: either way it's a whole bunch more to Italy|pg||
nt|sharkey: Trump return seemed natural|pg||
nt|sharkey: 2nd trick|pg||
nt|brolucius: In case the final deal is very exciting, or over in a few seconds, I will take this opportunity to thank our wonderful VG operator, Bas. Many thanks!|pg||
nt|bagman: Does west believe that the @DK sits in where it is?|pg||
nt|hedyg: was taking a nap :(|pg||
nt|frululu: this isnt a good match to watch for people with weak nerves :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: people with weak nerves shouldnt play bridge at all:)|pg||
nt|schtsch: possible to take 2@s a @h and a diamond before declarer takes his 9|pg||
pc|hK|nt|daman: E shd duck|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: N knows the @Cs are 5-0|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Looking rather worried lol|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: OR playing 6@C as well, I'm being told|pg||
nt|daman: this will probably take some time|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 36 minutes left on the clock|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Plenty o' that|pg||
nt|daman: beaucoup|pg||
nt|athene: the known diamond break is bad news for trying to set up diamonds or trying to crossruff|pg||
nt|athene: versace might be considering whether he can set up spades|pg||
nt|athene: but the problem is, he has the weak trumps, so he doesn't really want to use dummy's trumps for ruffing|pg||
nt|daman: 6@C -2 in the OR|pg||
nt|daman: he will finesse a H first|pg||
nt|andy_h: This will be 11 imps to Italy|pg||
nt|hedyg: probably being upset about the A@c play|pg||
nt|hedyg: why not @s back?|pg||
pc|h8|nt|bagman: Especially after the lead|pg||
nt|brolucius: Thanks as well to my fellow commentators Carl and Pekka. All the excitement came at the start. I ahve never seen so many big swings in a sequence.|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Thanks David, 't has been fun|pg||
nt|bagman: S did not return a @D so T is unlikely singleton|pg||
nt|bagman: OK, easy|pg||
nt|Gerben42: in other news: Germany 1 - England 0|pg||
nt|barnets: sounds ok to me|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Nice|pg||
nt|athene: but the italian style is not to make many lead doubles|pg||
pc|h5|nt|jtr: I will, just after i finish sticking needles in my eyes|pg||
nt|brolucius: Hah!|pg||
nt|andyv:  that was not right |pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|daman: gag|pg||
nt|stc: good play now, @s helps dec|pg||
nt|bagman: Only safe  re-entry is @HA and heart|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h9|nt|athene: they think it helps opponents more, on balance|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|brolucius: Good tactics psychologically to fail to split spade honours. Makes missing the game look worse. But such clever manoeuvres are better early in a match.|pg||
nt|stc: K@S the last safe exit card|pg||

nt|cuan: non è possibile|pg||
nt|figb_rama: dillo Gluck|pg||
nt|figb_rama: tanto la sala resta aperta|pg||
nt|gluckenval: in caso di parità tra Lettonia Galles e Croazia passerebbe la Lettonia per la classifica avulsa|pg||
nt|rcerreto: 4@s -1 alla 17?|pg||
nt|cuan: volete controllare il 4@S di là alla 17 ?|pg||
nt|tax456: meno maleù|pg||
nt|figb_rama: comunque adesso siamo a -36 e in chiusa deve ancora passare il 300 per noi alla 18|pg||
nt|gluckenval: a 4@S sembra che abbiano pagato 3@H, il dichiarante ha ipotizzato l'Asso secco o secondo in Nord|pg||
nt|figb_rama: Eria puoi contattare tu la chiusa?|pg||

nt|rcerreto: la difesa ha fatto 1@d e 3@h|pg||
nt|Vugraphznj: si board giusto|pg||
nt|gluckenval: I croati in chiusa non hanno idea di che razza di score chiuso gli portano da questa sala, un attimo di deconcentrazione capita.|pg||

nt|rcerreto: il croato se la sognerà questa notte|pg||

nt|rcerreto: brrr|pg||
nt|cuan: la croazia perderà ancora qualcosa al board 18|pg||

nt|figb_rama: però, non avendo giustamente risparmiato critiche ai nostri per questo incontro, dobbiamo riconoscere che la Dama di @H di Agus è una cartona|pg||

nt|cuan: cacchio|pg||
nt|gluckenval: i running scores di questo girone si sono simpaticamente disconnessi....|pg||

nt|gluckenval: si, 2 imps|pg||
nt|rcerreto: speriamo che il Galles faccia qualche punto negli ultimi board altrimenti ci tocca pure chiedere loro scusa|pg||
nt|gluckenval: Galles a 3 mani dalla fine 14-16 vs Slovacchia.... sempre 288|pg||
nt|figb_rama: fatte 4@H|pg||
nt|figb_rama: 25|pg||
nt|rcerreto: splendido :(|pg||
nt|figb_rama: tu pensa in che razza di situazione...|pg||
nt|gluckenval: ok, Croazia finisce a 288|pg||
nt|figb_rama: con un altro imp per loro facevamo 4|pg||
nt|rcerreto: questa al momento è l'unica certezza|pg||
nt|cuan: la croazia ha fatto 4@H|pg||
nt|gluckenval: a 2 mani dalla fine purtroppo il Galles peggiora... ora 287|pg||

nt|mdgraham: last board. It's been pretty unavailing for the Lithuanians, I'm afraid|pg||
nt|paulg:  an excellent performance so far by Scotland|pg||
nt|brolucius: South clearly thought that 3@C was conventional at the other table.|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Isn't the W hand a LV 2@D opener?|pg||
nt|hedyg: we will be back in 72 minutes|pg||
nt|brolucius: He must have thought North held both majors. But you would expect 3@D would be explained as showing hearts.|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes it is he upgraded|pg||
nt|brolucius: There is not space here to explain the full reasoning behind the 7@C bid.|pg||
nt|stc: 7@c in OR was intended as choose between @c and @s but not understood as such|pg||
nt|stc: 6@d was simpler to understand|pg||
nt|hedyg: he could have tried 6 @s...|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Versace possibly thought 3@D was natural too, because of the explanation he got that 3@C were both majors|pg||
nt|brolucius: Bocchi-Madala will expect to handle the North/South cards somewhat better.|pg||
nt|iain sime: Might be a pick up v. 7@H !|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why would you give partner that choice when he already selected spades? By a jump even|pg||

nt|rodvenn: Norway has bid 2 slams on questionable values. |pg||

nt|fabsayc: not saying they needed to be there, just that north hand has a lot of potential cover cards|pg||
nt|andyv:  but here it didn't matter...N had to find a @c lead.. not easy...S might have risked a dble of 6@d asking for pd not to lead a spade.|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: thx all|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty Martin, Stefan and all the specs who joined us and made this a lot of fun.|pg||
mb|4H|nt|bagman: thx all|pg||
nt|andyv:  re:)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, sure, partnership bidding is the key to being successful at bridge :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: How did I go?|pg||
nt|bagman: They are vulnerable so they might bid it|pg||
nt|brolucius: Many thanks to Bas for the extra table-side information. (The mark of a top VG operator...)|pg||
nt|petergill: Can they reach 4@H?|pg||
nt|gulyas: 2@H not as good as 2@S|pg||
nt|hedyg: too strong for 2@H not enough for 1@H|pg||
nt|gulyas: N just had the hand to reopen 2@H tho|pg||
nt|gulyas: now they are in 2@S as well|pg||
nt|skorchev: another makeable 4M :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  I may have to concede that there may be some merit to constructive raises... but I'm not yet there:)|pg||
nt|koksoy: this  is  the  last  hand  ty  all  to  all  specs , Pekka and paul  and  our  operator  Philippe|pg||

nt|petergill: or 5@D?  |pg||
nt|athene: 2nt from north, so Duboin gets to play 3@C, i suppose|pg||
nt|fabsayc: delayed 3@S?!|pg||
nt|skorchev: 4@S|pg||
nt|skorchev: or 3@H|pg||

nt|bagman: 1NT now|pg||
nt|ziff:  Nearly 1000 kibitzers still around Peter, no problem :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  Scotland have played well in the first two days of the tournament and hopefully that will set them up for the tough days ahead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Last board of the match now|pg||
nt|andy_h: Transfer responses after an interference of an opening bid, hence 1@H=5+@S|pg||
nt|rodvenn: but a very entertaining fight!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thanks Bas, Vladimir, Andy, Jon, Christian and Martin|pg||
nt|paulg:  i think we've all lost the clubs|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|brolucius: May not be so easy to keep low when the heart fit is found.|pg||
nt|jtr: I suppose West might cue now|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: lol, wb|pg||
nt|andyv:  1600 viewers here... thanks to all the specs for joining us and helping us with their comments and questions|pg||
nt|bagman: Easy bidding followed by easy play, I guess|pg||
nt|hedyg: we will be back tomorrow morning at 9 30 local time|pg||
nt|andy_h: And an interesting rebid from Bocchi|pg||
nt|bagman: East migh value his KJ a bit too much|pg||
nt|stc: W opened 2NT, you have 5@ss, hard to believe that partner has 5+@s and no @c fit !!|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I am not sure whether Zivkovic alerted 3@D, I would assume so|pg||
pc|cK|nt|daman: thanks to Bill Frisby and Tezcan Sen for their analysis|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Be advised: we're starting one hour earlier tomorrow, 9:30 AM local time and 8:30 AM London|pg||
nt|tez: ty all:)|pg||
nt|jkotor: 3@h x -1?|pg||
nt|petergill: A very easy 620 to finish|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: One of the few times where the CR has more kibs than the OR. Must be the excellent commentary :)|pg||
pc|c8|nt|jtr: Having already shown a minimum|pg||
nt|bagman: @SA @HAK club |pg||
nt|bjacobs: Can he end in a blaze of glory?  The bidding is very informative|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It seems hard to believe that GIB thinks 4@S can make, but there it is|pg||
nt|jbgood: another good result for Italy coming in now - 3 NT in the other room was "a bit" high..|pg||
nt|bagman: Not exactly the friendiest of layouts for W|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the open of 1@D would work better here|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: "Lauria has left the table"|pg||
nt|Gerben42: if they pinpoint the @S problem...|pg||
nt|petergill: 2NT forcing|pg||
nt|gulyas: 3@C makes|pg||
nt|skorchev: oopsy, I didn't saw the pass of 1@S by South, sry|pg||
nt|jkotor: bo kontra na 3@c chyba ze wzglêdu na opozycjê kierow¹|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: S and W predicting the auction now :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Saying N will bid 3@D - X - 3@H - p - p - X - ap|pg||
nt|bogier: oj, Bale juz ich chyba nie wypuszcz¹|pg||
nt|jkotor: S i W próbuj¹ przewidzieæ licytacjê|pg||
nt|andyv:  the Italian team has played very well... the Irish tead did have some chances|pg||
nt|mdgraham: looks like just three losers |pg||
nt|petergill: 4@SX would be 500 I think|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|brolucius: 4@D a cue-bid with heart agreed.|pg||
nt|bagman: Normally they would be nice but facing this bad suit they are not that useful|pg||
nt|brolucius: Not easy to stop low because there are so many hands to be covered by relatively few sequences and it is not possible to discover that much about each hand.|pg||
nt|bagman: Getting plus here is worth 8 IMPs|pg||
nt|bagman: Going one down is worth 3|pg||
nt|brolucius: East must at least be thinking about passing 3@H.|pg||
nt|hedyg: Mossop might wake up now to the transfer?|pg||
nt|hedyg: no|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: But Mossop didn't wholeheartedly|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Please stick around as I will show the missed board 16|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok we will!|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Mossop explaining now that 3@D was undiscussed|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So the 1700 will not be that costly; this is only a question of an overtrick or not|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6 or 7 IMPs|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Mossop saying he took 3@D as constructive with @D|pg||
nt|iain sime: Italy have missed the save , but will still pick up 7 imps or so.|pg||
nt|hedyg: you dont expect opps to overcall 2NT thus dont discuss your bids in case they do?|pg||
nt|stc: 6@s probably -800|pg||
nt|hedyg: push opps into making grand?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 6 or 7 IMPs won't matter for the VP score: 21:9|pg||
pc|h2|nt|brolucius: East still sees at least two holes unless partner can bid again. Well bid.|pg||
nt|jtr: East has too many hooles to be interested even if the @d cue was the Ace|pg||
nt|jtr: holes|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, they bid it well. (Famous last words as West raises to 6@H...)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And West has done enough too with his aceless hand|pg||
nt|jtr: lol|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He already encouraged with 4@D|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, but he does have five trumps, which makes the singleton spade a little more attractive than it would otherwise have been.|pg||
nt|brgpro: what is W thinking about?|pg||
nt|jtr: Bidding a 'Roland' slam|pg||
nt|brolucius: Maybe what he should bid next.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If East can't take an initiative over 4@D, West can't bid on in my opinion|pg||
nt|hedyg: we will be back in 75 minutes|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Thanks Hedy, fellow commentators and kibs! I can only hope you liked it as much as me :)|pg||
nt|bagman: Fast 11 tricks|pg||
nt|stc: then 7@s for -1100|pg||
pc|h7|nt|atabey: TY Hedy my colleges and spectators|pg||
nt|brolucius: bravo!|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but in italian system 1@D means 4+cards unbalanced|pg||
nt|andyv:  something wrong with a system that misses the 5-4 fit for the 5-2|pg||
nt|bagman: 2@C artificial, I guess|pg||
pc|hK|nt|Vugraphznk: My pleasure Roland, I enjoyed it :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Next round in 50 minutes|pg||
nt|xenya: thanks everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Italy v Slovakia|pg||
nt|jbgood: bye all |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Lebanon v France|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Austria v Netherlands|pg||
nt|andy_h: In an uncontested auction, N/S play some form of gazzilli after 1@D-1M-2@C showing either a natural club suit or 16+|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Israel v Ireland|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Italy Slovakia 2-3? :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Denmark v Sweden (women)|pg||
nt|andy_h: either 1NT is 12-16 or Bocchi "downgraded" to 12-14 based on his singleton spade. Triple-four-one hands are always hard to bid|pg||
nt|cicus: 2NT doesn't|pg||
nt|andyv:  N did think about it.  S did bid 2@s on his own so he is pretty sure S has 4 @s and nothing else.|pg||
nt|skorchev: looks like North is short of entries to take all finesses|pg||
nt|koksoy: bye..|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|jtr: But 6 is rather too good for him|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and he realised that eventually|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thanks all, back in 1 hour and a wee bit|pg||
nt|Gerben42: impressive|pg||
nt|petergill: They pinpointed the spade problem, as one expects from these Italians|pg||
nt|gulyas: 2NT may not|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: cos odrobimy|pg||
nt|corplaw: declarer can make this with good reads|pg||
nt|schtsch: @cK and a @s for discard|pg||
pc|h8|nt|Gerben42: playing like this they are among the big favorites|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Another 4@H by EW in a 7 card fit :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: surely 2NT was not natural|pg||
nt|athene: 2nt is a bad spot, as usual|pg||
nt|jkotor: pik do skrótu?|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: England - Ukraine have only compared 4 boards!|pg||

nt|hedyg: yes lots of fun :(|pg||
nt|barnets: http://www.shenkinbridge.com/    some asked me to repeat|pg||
nt|Gerben42: again from Duboin|pg||
nt|athene: i don't know how NS play it but most experts treat all these 2nt bids as artificial, usually showing two places to play|pg||
nt|cicus: without @Cs N has only 6 tricks|pg||
nt|jkotor: gib mówi, ¿e to chodzi|pg||

nt|andyv:  ty Bas for your wonderful work and ty Barbara, it's been a pleasure.  And a big thanks to all the specs who make this a most enjoyable way to spend a couple of hours.|pg||
pc|s6|nt|snetram:  5 trefli - praktycznie bez jednej|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Duboin probably had his reasons to pass|pg||

nt|andyv:  good night all|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 70-68 isner|pg||
pc|dA|nt|bagman: Well guessed|pg||
nt|bagman: Now he makes for 8 IMPs|pg||
nt|andyv:  not sure how he could do it|pg||
nt|petergill: Thanks to Matthias Berghaus and Mike Graham for their comments and to Bas for being one of the best operators around|pg||
nt|mdgraham: second that|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Thanks Peter, and thank you for your sharing of your wit with us despite the late hour :)|pg||
nt|petergill: Anyone know why Versace doubled 3@S instead of simply bidding 4@H?|pg||
nt|ziff:  And to Peter and all the kibitzers, who keep us busy and make it fun|pg||
nt|mdgraham: possibly to show two places to play |pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|pg||
nt|petergill: He was a passed hand - perhaps he was showing a maximum 4@H bid in case slam was on?|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|jtr: A close well-fought match|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes they are not doubled yet|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jkotor: ale ju¿ -1|pg||
pc|s9|nt|hedyg: OMG!|pg||
nt|hedyg: will they ever stop?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: its over|pg||
nt|gulyas: he was not sure they have a @C fit?|pg||
nt|bagman: The trump lead is helpful. Declarer draws trumps and sets up the clubs|pg||
nt|mdgraham: although holding five hearts 4@H is likely to be as good a spot as any - also, East might be enormous and EW may have a slam |pg||
nt|ziff:  They always keep slam in the picture....|pg||
nt|mdgraham: thanks all.|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I think he wouldnt mind if partner passes with say 2344|pg||
nt|petergill: Thanks to EBL and to anyone in Ostend Belgium who made this broadcast possible|pg||

nt|brolucius: inspection).|pg||
