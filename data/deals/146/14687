nt|athene: are they really playing this fast?|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: N in the OR also opened 1@h |pg||

nt|star6ija: 17-18 direct 1 N, 19-20 via 1h|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: well they scaped from that one |pg||
nt|ralfwil: the only positive for ns is that it´s undoubled|pg||
nt|oleberg: 3 down could be possible, but requires accurate defence|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: all the key cards are badly placed K@H,K@S,AQ@C|pg||
nt|riccho: 11-13 SA bei Gro und Andreas|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: EW system is 4-card majors, light style 14-16 and 15-17NT. NS is Transfer Walsh 15-17NT|pg||
nt|athene: tricky hand to play - ruffing diamond finesse is a possibility|pg||
nt|bagman: There are lot's of high cards out and E passed and W opened weak|pg||
nt|athene: the problem is that ruffing diamond finesse might not be that useful, even if the king is with east|pg||
nt|athene: because if the @DQ is covered you have to use the @CA to get back there for a fast pitch of the heart|pg||
nt|athene: and that gives up on a double club finesse|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer wants a quick discards and wants to play the clubs for one loser|pg||
nt|athene: it's possible he might put all his eggs in one basket and take a normal diamond finesse; i.e. lead to the queen|pg||
nt|bagman: W  has shown up with @HKQ, does he have @DK and @CH?|pg||
nt|athene: the other issue is, you aren't necessarily going all-out to make|pg||
nt|athene: if it risks incurring two or three additional vulnerable undertricks|pg||
nt|bagman: S vulnerable he needs to make as many tricks as possible unless he has 9 safe|pg||
nt|bagman: He has likely 3 spade losers and a club|pg||
nt|athene: not at all an easy decision for south here|pg||
nt|athene: i prefer to open these hands 2@S first time|pg||
nt|athene: passing might appear safer but you often end up having to take more of a risk later at a higher level|pg||
nt|bagman: If he takes the straight diamond finesse, he needs to play @S to the Q|pg||
nt|athene: he knows the points are split fairly evenly between east and west|pg||
nt|bagman: Hoping for Jx KQxxx Kxx Qx or similar leaving E AKx xx xxx Kxx|pg||
nt|athene: west has weak-2 and east can't open - that doesn't leave much room for variation, with 21 hcp missing|pg||
nt|athene: the only problem is, there are a lot of variations in which cards each defender has|pg||
nt|bagman: If he places KQ of hearts and @DK west, he is quite restricted to place the rest for a make|pg||
nt|andreasw:  only lead is @S if u dont want to give any trick's|pg||
nt|haans: South do not liked it|pg||
nt|othered1: hi!|pg||

nt|athene: maybe they want to get finished early so they can watch murray-nadal :)|pg||
pc|h7|nt|lmeili: 4N shows 6 4?|pg||
nt|ziff:  Looks like the par contract|pg||
nt|yuval10: so no swing in a rather dangerous board |pg||
nt|yuval10: Israeli open for instance opened 1@c and played it wrong-sidedly, going down 1|pg||
nt|aldek: it can be made, but unlikely|pg||
nt|cameron_1: yes|pg||
nt|mdgraham: looking at the banner, you can be dead certain|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the W is a clue|pg||
nt|udo: naja, 1-3 SA wär auch mal was neues|pg||
pc|h2|nt|roswolf: another thinnish game reached|pg||

nt|haans: Hi Barry wlc|pg||

nt|poohbear: dont mean to chat|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: hi barry|pg||
nt|udo: 4 @H fails , even finding @H Queen doubleton is not enough|pg||
nt|udo: no entries for the 2 top-spades for diamond discards|pg||
nt|brolucius: East expects six hearts for a 2@H rebid that bypasses so many alternative rebid. Hence the raise.|pg||
nt|udo: hm, only 2 clublooses|pg||
nt|udo: losers|pg||
nt|othered1: with @CJ on, this does make (6@H, 2@S, 1@D, 1@C)|pg||
nt|udo: small @H to jack will be enough|pg||
nt|othered1: or win in dummy, pitch @C, hook rounded suits|pg||
nt|othered1: sorry, pitch @D|pg||
nt|udo: or 2 discards after heart to the jack|pg||
nt|othered1: (Ignore me, I'll awaken shortly)|pg||
nt|udo: jack of clubs is the important card, and it is well placed|pg||
nt|udo: same here:)|pg||
nt|udo: good morning ED:)|pg||
nt|tomi2:  I think they should not have bid that game, IMO east should have passed 2@H|pg||
nt|brolucius: At last I have managed to find a Lauria-Versace convention card. The 2NT response on Board 1 was a limit bid in partner's major. More often nowadays, 2NT shows a game-forcing ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: raise.|pg||
nt|8252: les 2 derniers matche sdes français comptent donc double, puisque Bulgare et allemands seront au tour suivant|pg||
nt|ralfwil: except @dK:)|pg||
nt|oleberg: A switch to the @DQ is the first step towards -3|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Operator, please insert player names|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|andreasw:  u can also selved @d self but would problebly go wrong|pg||

nt|haans: a killer|pg||
nt|h_karluk: it's a technical term, no offense intended|pg||
nt|riccho: lol|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|haans: i do not like prempts over prempts|pg||
nt|h_karluk: they missed 6@d by N|pg||
nt|lesh: the dbl is asking for the type of hand and 3@c is min hand with 6+clubs|pg||
nt|lesniak: wietna zrzutka Adama|pg||
nt|oleberg: Unless I've missed an endplay|pg||
nt|oleberg: A third round of clubs will promote a heart trick, but diamonds have to be cashed first|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: Est will duck nice defence only if he is nervous to play a quick 2 nd @C|pg||
nt|oleberg: And spades|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Lauria not tempted to do any more than 5C |pg||
nt|psridhar: W might hv raised that 2h|pg||

nt|odysseus69: only 50s - 3 of them|pg||

pc|c2|nt|andersk: a push now, 1 NT RD would been interesting|pg||
nt|andreasw:  solved|pg||
nt|odysseus69: may manage 2 down|pg||
nt|bagman: NS might make a partscore here but with xxx in diamonds neither player is willing to compete|pg||
nt|mdgraham: both pairs pretty natural; 5-card majors, strong NT|pg||
pc|c3|nt|jameslee 2: on the other room hand 1 the lead was a small @S in 4@H |pg||

pc|c8|nt|ady: should get home here     club loser will disappear|pg||
nt|davidb: S should play cl  to defeat|pg||
nt|ady: might beat it now with a club switch|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer seeks an entry with the @HJ.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We have something for the history books after this mornings round. Italy has lost back-to-back matches! No-one can remember when that last happened. Los 10-20 to Hungary last night ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and 14-16 against Hungary today|pg||
nt|tomi2:  was his intention to duck the 10 or overtake?|pg||
nt|othered1: EW system is described as Swiss-ACOL.   I'm not sure how limited the 2@H bid was.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Duck, I expect, to set up the @HJ (or avoid losing a trump trick). Unlikely that they would duck @HQ - but possible at this level.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We got the names right now, thank you operator|pg||
nt|riccho: Die 1" klemmt bei mir manchmal... :(|pg||
pc|c5|nt|yannis3012: hi ntino|pg||
nt|ziff:  I imagine 4NT showed a desire to play that contract|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|bagman: If he places the @DK east, he has probably some better chances to make|pg||
nt|brolucius: Now declarer can ditch his diamonds.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We can't expect her/him to have the  ö  on the keyboard|pg||
nt|mdgraham: would it be possible to have the player names please operator? |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: well a bit of air for North|pg||
nt|oleberg: Reasonable defence. No way of knowing partners hearts are so good, that he doesnt need ruffs|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|d9|pg||
nt|yannis3012: evrything is in, so 3nt is cold|pg||
nt|eweber: it seems we didn't miss too much by starting a bit late here|pg||
nt|aldek: however south did not enter the bidding over 1@D with some cards in the majors,|pg||
nt|bagman: 1NT opening at this vulnerability was 9-12|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Souths aces perhaps justify the flexible double, but the long and tight hearts favour bidding on. Tough decision |pg||
pc|s2|nt|haans: close to error|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Italy's match this morning was against Bulgaria. Sorry for mentioning Hungary twice|pg||
nt|f_aydogdu: kotü 3nt 4sp iyi kontrat salvonun eliyle 4sp derdim|pg||
nt|athene: some might play leaping michaels over the multi, so 4@C = clubs +major|pg||
pc|s4|nt|rigas_karo: +1 now|pg||
nt|Walddk12: Operator, a couple of typos in North's name   Haraldsson|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We have about 19 pedants in the audience|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Onother typo, 199 I meant|pg||

nt|justin c: from our vantage point, a low @C lead at trick 1 looks like the best shot for EW|pg||
nt|h_karluk: tactical bid|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Israel in 7@d on bd 1|pg||
nt|suketbombi: very tuff he may find pd with stiff @H or void letting him option to defend|pg||
nt|j li: O/W können 2@H machen, kommen aber nie in die Reizung|pg||
nt|riccho: Erst 1s jetzt 11SA... der Start ist nicht unbedingt "heiß"|pg||

nt|mamos: David prederving that 1D2|pg||

nt|cameron_1: thinking followed by going down most likely :(|pg||

pc|h8|nt|Walddk2: I don't expect the operator to have the  Ø  on his keyboard, no big deal. JORGENSEN is fine|pg||
nt|Walddk2: N-S play 5443 with a strong NT|pg||
nt|psridhar: spd back instead of that h will lead to a dummy lock temporarily, but decl might still make|pg||

pc|s6|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ady: may be a swing for Israel|pg||
nt|roswolf: an agressively bid game slips through again|pg||

nt|odysseus69: 2D was the Mexican 2D - used to be balanced 19/20 but inflation reduced to 18|pg||
nt|ady: much better with west declarer|pg||
nt|athene: they aren't missing any keycards - it might be hard to see|pg||
nt|Walddk2: All very natural. 1NT a better rebid than 2@C imo|pg||
pc|s8|nt|star6ija: Bulgarians are in 3N in the open room|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Vladimir and Ivan vs Thor Erik and Thomas|pg||
nt|justin c: twilight zone|pg||

nt|psridhar: a thoughtful lead spd 8|pg||
pc|s3|nt|bagman: good for them as the heart finesse is off|pg||
nt|athene: for example playing transfers you could bid 1@S there to show values but deny a major|pg||
nt|athene: assuming your 1@C is not raise-able, as is the case for most people these days :(|pg||
nt|bagman: I wonder what 1NT would have shown by S |pg||
nt|star6ija: board 1|pg||
nt|mcarroll: A swing so as 3NT makes on 1|pg||

pc|sA|pg||
nt|lmeili: @d AK then @h|pg||
nt|bagman: The diamond length often makes up for the missing stopper|pg||
nt|athene: south really likes his hand after his partner's free 2@C rebid|pg||
nt|bagman: Interesting 3@H|pg||
nt|bagman: cannot be natural|pg||
nt|athene: he is looking for 3nt - prepared to play 4@C if necessary|pg||
nt|haans: cue-bidding makes slam harder to make :)|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: the bid is on the limit ·3@H |pg||
nt|haans: but all will get higher|pg||
nt|andersk: this will be an easy make |pg||

nt|sastro: Man wird das As legen und auf ein Endspiel setzen - es ist wahrscheinlicher dass W @S könig hält als beide @C  Figuren ( bei klein Angriff|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I can see 6 tricks for declarer. Is there a 7th? I don't think so|pg||
nt|psridhar: i expect it to be a successful lead too, an interesting play / defend hand|pg||
pc|c6|nt|roswolf: north does bid the slam how is south's luck today?|pg||

nt|ralfwil: perhaps could S have doubled 2@h from E|pg||

nt|bagman: With heart lead the contract would have gone down in quite natural manner declarer not having time to establish diamonds|pg||
nt|suketbombi: mat:)|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|Gerben42: Netherlands had a bad start vs Ireland, whereas Russia started with a small win vs Sweden, a competitor for a Bermuda Bowl spot|pg||

nt|MolvaM: seems many norths could just blast 4@s after hearing pd open a weak 2 here|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: should go off even with the @c lead|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: S is trying to make @S tricks problem no direct entry time for E-W to make @H good|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: still double stopper helps him to make contract |pg||
nt|odysseus69: difficult to keep oppo out of bidding- |pg||
nt|suketbombi: may:)|pg||
pc|dK|nt|haans: 5@H risky|pg||
nt|xenya: @SA followed by @SK and another spade would have defeated it -- previous hand |pg||
nt|bagman: Now the defense has started to attack declarer's long suits|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes both of them. But obvious to dbl 2 @h??|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Bd 2 E open room|pg||

pc|dA|pg||
nt|lmeili: when @d QJ does'nt fall, still the chance @h 3-3 or Tx, and @c K on side|pg||
nt|bagman: It needs the heart finesse|pg||
nt|aap00: 1@c = strong, 1@s = looks like "bal GF", some relays|pg||
nt|ftpe: yes|pg||
nt|haans: few entries to dummy|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: getting worse after K@H|pg||
nt|haans: well only non vul|pg||
nt|brolucius: Only 1 IMP to Germany for the fancy play in 4@H. Semanta advanced with 2NT on the East cards, after the same start, and 3NT was bid and made.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: guys, was that a hidden camera joke? I meant 2nd trick a low spade towards dummy|pg||
nt|andersk: Or @C|pg||
nt|lesh: if the king of spades is 3rd in East, he needs A@h to be in West|pg||
nt|lesh: the small spade makes no sense|pg||
nt|h_karluk: I think today is Monday June 28, 2010, so obviously not April one, whatever|pg||

pc|c3|nt|aap00: playing @dQ, not 10 correct - you can discard 3d @d by @c|pg||

pc|c2|nt|shevek: maybe they shouldn't be so keen not vul|pg||

pc|cK|nt|motu: what about restriced choise|pg||
nt|mcarroll: S looking for N's entry for a @D ruff|pg||
nt|haans: many austrians have played Blue Clubs for 30 years|pg||
nt|MolvaM: specs tell me 3@s shows a no-singleton hand and a bad-bad hand|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: true|pg||
nt|bagman: With 4 spades and a heart it is enough to score only 4 tricks in the minors|pg||
nt|bagman: As both are 33 declarer can pick either|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|santyclz: Certainly rates to be a much quicker hand in @cs than @ss.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Now has the problem of guessing the trumps to make 5|pg||
nt|aap00: thk no real chance to go wrong|pg||
nt|ftpe: he will win for sure, but migth take some time :)|pg||
nt|xenya: no -- he will play for @SKxx in the W hand|pg||
nt|bagman: North is silently cursing now as he knows that partner had 3 hearts|pg||
nt|idc: interesting shot leading the @d, perhaps to try to steal a trick and make NS think he was strong in @d|pg||
nt|idc: But I'm still not sure I can recommend it|pg||
nt|idc: sorry, brain not working yet|pg||
pc|dT|nt|bagman: Now comes the @CJ |pg||

pc|d9|nt|haans: we have all learned yes on 8 no on 9|pg||
nt|star6ija: that is the question|pg||
nt|lesh: what it seems to be a flat board turn out to be a possible swing|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: real danger of an endplay here, I think a @s discard instead of a @d would have been better|pg||
nt|yusufb: @s iyi cýktý ama @c de cýksa 3@c caktýgý için batardý|pg||

nt|andreasw:  yes no problems for declarer|pg||
nt|bagman: Did not have 9 tricks: 4 spades, 3 clubs -> the defense can set up 2 diamonds|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He may even go 2 down now as he no longer has an entry to the good diamond|pg||
nt|psridhar: there comes the entry|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Unless Cedolin played the queen|pg||
pc|h2|nt|rigas_karo: still|pg||
nt|yannis3012: yes. greek women are losing 10-0 after three boards from russia , one of the favourites|pg||
nt|andersk: -2 for a push|pg||
nt|ady: going down|pg||
nt|shevek: yes, a bid of 3@c/@d or@h over 2NT would show a Max with a shortage|pg||
nt|MolvaM: I see several 4s making with this board in other matches|pg||
nt|andreasw:  i have seen worse 2@s opening before|pg||
nt|brolucius: It may seem a bit light to bid 2NT on a 10-count, but both responders were allowing for six trick-producing hearts ion the opener's hand.|pg||
nt|andreasw:  cullin has to play @h now, else 10 tricks|pg||
pc|h3|nt|haans: not beg difference|pg||

nt|bagman: @CA, @C to Q, @DJ|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|h_karluk: The Bamberger pair was good at their own sys, got many victories|pg||
nt|xenya: but it's odds in to play for the actual spade disitribution|pg||
nt|xenya: odds on *|pg||
nt|aap00: no squeeze chances, so N has to guess - play on @dJ onside or @hK remaining bare|pg||

nt|tomi2:  2004 yes, 2008 not|pg||

nt|odysseus69: 10 tricks only|pg||
pc|c9|nt|rnmalik: yep|pg||
pc|s6|nt|andersk: actually quite interesting start|pg||

nt|jameslee 2: hand 2 3@D contract also & same lead 4@D |pg||
nt|haans: Fallenius do no like it|pg||

nt|jameslee 2: nice defense K@D well done |pg||
nt|athene: actually i guess it was safe to run the spade|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bagman: South is pretty safe now to make 2 spade tricks for the contract|pg||
nt|barnets: there are 7 more matches to be played after this one|pg||
pc|sK|nt|athene: at worst north might win and give his partner a ruff in hearts|pg||
pc|s9|nt|Gerben42: this was a good stop by NS - with so many HCP, 4NT might be too high|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|brolucius: Only the scores against teams that also qualified are carried over to this second stage.|pg||
nt|psridhar: Berg has taken the triks that Roland precribed for him..and result is d1|pg||
mc|6|nt|ziff:  Whatever he wanted to do, he didn t fool Michael|pg||

nt|roswolf: israel missed the game on bd 1|pg||
nt|mamos: so a poor start for England   --  both these teams have some work to do to ensure qualification for the second round robin|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: a good 4@H contract coming along |pg||
nt|snetram:  czy to nie jest konserwatyzm - 2 karo z takimi pikami|pg||
nt|lechcold: bardzo solidny styl otwaræ u naszych - lubiê tak:)|pg||
nt|pikolo: tylko 1 imp ró¿nicy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@H I expect, sopund spade raise|pg||
mb|4S|nt|tomi2:  hi all|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: another dangerous hand @S behind opener |pg||
nt|ady: looks like 1NT|pg||
mb|p|nt|motu: hi tomi|pg||
nt|ziff:  Hi Tomi|pg||
nt|chick: yes, jivko, but @DA and small trump still doesn't hurt in that case|pg||
nt|lesh: if the small @s wins, then you have a problem|pg||
nt|andersk: over 3rd and 4th hand openings EW play a drury|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: double swing board one and 1st blood austria|pg||
nt|justin c: this double not to everybody's taste|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: no move after openning |pg||
nt|oleberg: EW plays 2@S as a strong-weak 2@S, while 2@D would be a weak-weak 2@S (or@H)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  same bidding but doubled by north|pg||
nt|riccho: der war jetzt vielleicht nicht nötig, aber der imp wirds auch nicht entscheiden|pg||
nt|psridhar: thats is quite a 'soft' hand for overclling 1S vul, but he has struck the 9 card fit; only his pd shd avoid -500 in 4s|pg||
nt|idc: In the old days, South wouldn't have a hand this good after so much bidding|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think that hand is too flat for 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|motu: 2@D is 15-19 with any onesuiter or 20-21 NT|pg||
nt|lmeili: wrong side to play @s|pg||
nt|motu: 2@S is 9+ any hand|pg||
nt|andersk: Sorry Im late, was dinner here:)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: however there's transportation problem|pg||
nt|bagman: With spades 2-2 declarer can set up the hearts before losing 3 club tricks to make 10 tricks in spades|pg||
nt|yusufb: yýllar once kýsa süre anlayamadým ben:)|pg||
nt|skaftij:  7 TRICKS|pg||
nt|ady: communications difficult |pg||
nt|athene: 2@H non-forcing i assume|pg||

nt|h_karluk: its ok, welcome back|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi Anders|pg||
nt|yuval10: can they reach 5@c here?|pg||
nt|roswolf: in the other room|pg||
nt|ady: kib has asked for the link for the running score|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 10/11 tricks in @H |pg||

nt|hawe45:  1 @H = minimum|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2NT by Gold would now be 'any game try'. (if West were to pass).|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@c=FG or weak 2@D|pg||
nt|riccho: 3SA hat jetzt bestimmt eine krude Bedeutung, die ich hier nur nicht dechiffrieren kann|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 5C comong|pg||

nt|athene: that's standard in poland although not in many other places|pg||
pc|h2|nt|haans: 1@D normal trf|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 10 tricks in diamonds|pg||
nt|ady: they are difficult for both declarer and defenders|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Give partner a chance to bail out by cue bidding hearts|pg||
nt|psridhar: in the olden days that E hand would have chopped 4s as well Ian |pg||
pc|h3|nt|Gerben42: no its played with 18 teams, you dont replay the teams in your group|pg||
nt|star6ija: some prospects for making|pg||
nt|cameron_1: David has a much harder time in his 5@d |pg||
nt|aap00: say u have 6 for KJx vs 4 for J10x, but believe that 50% times W will play K with KJx => 3 vs 4 remaining|pg||
nt|haans: normal today|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 1@D meaning  4 card @H|pg||
nt|lesh: but still a trump finess seems to be the best line|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 5D coming?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 3D looks a Russian special|pg||
nt|odysseus69: coming now|pg||

pc|h5|pg||
nt|andersk: Will be interesting to see if they find the deefence|pg||
nt|andersk: Hi Martin, Hamdi:)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i wonder west's defense to this one|pg||
nt|andreasw:  1nt force?|pg||
nt|antoniz: farcik jest:)|pg||
nt|lechcold: mniam:)|pg||
nt|snetram:  zabawne|pg||
nt|mdgraham: NS strong club, variable NT; EW 5M, weak NT, 1@C may be weak NT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: first blood to Sweden on board 1 - the Swedish EW made 6@s|pg||
nt|odysseus69: cant get to 3NT now- |pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@D looks to be to play opposite a weak two in diamonds - however one suspects a crossed wire|pg||
nt|yusufb: 30 yas civarý sanýrým|pg||
nt|psridhar: these days the one opening is not given due respect; if u want an example look at the danish opening on Bd 2 in other room|pg||
nt|idc: And too good as well - looks like a 2@h bid, possibly followed by an invite to 3@s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If you belong in game, you will get there after 2@H. When North signs off in 2@S, you have done enough in my opinion|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|andersk: I beleve 2 @C is drury with 3 card|pg||
nt|aap00: no cards for 6 |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 2@S shape & points |pg||
nt|justin c: as a passed hand, West might have stretched to 2@D |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: first duck from declarer to open comunication |pg||
nt|oleberg: Declarer will probaly try to "scramble"; getting his small thrumphs home|pg||
nt|ozgull: yani adamlar 27-28 yaþlarýnda|pg||
pc|dK|nt|eweber: and of those 10 teams 6+NL will play in the Bermuda Bowl|pg||
nt|andersk: Has to switch @D or @C noe, I predeict @D|pg||
nt|ady: this needed a major suit lead |pg||
nt|kdr_fm: nothing breaking (well @C 5/4) this is going off a few|pg||
nt|oleberg: Instead of trying to drawthrumphs, and control the hand|pg||
nt|odysseus69: no|pg||
nt|athene: defence just have to get their spades going|pg||
nt|athene: but it won't be hard to attack spades, seeing that dummy|pg||
nt|odysseus69: wont be difficult|pg||
pc|dA|nt|bagman: quiet lookin partial, declarer probably making 9 tricks|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 3@H  6 card |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 4@H end |pg||
nt|lesh: unfortunately for E/W 4@s is making|pg||
nt|barnets: 5@D would be a good save down just 1|pg||
nt|brolucius: The doubletons in spades, also the vulnerability, are a deterrent.|pg||
nt|bagman: The defense has 4 tricks but they have not the means to take them (3 clubs and a heart)|pg||
nt|brolucius: The 2-2 spade break will now be helpful to declarer, providing an entry to the long hearts.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Murray lost first set|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer ruffs this, draws two rounds of trumps with QJ and starts hearts|pg||
nt|babs59: strange lead v. 4@C??|pg||
nt|odysseus69: and a strange lead-cant believe it|pg||
nt|athene: there's the principle of the obvious shift - and the principle of the blindingly obvious shift :)|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|yuval10: did well here, and in the OR as well|pg||
nt|MolvaM: running scores http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/runningscores/asp/roundteamsconditstatclassicmod.asp?qtournid=819&qshowflag=1|pg||
nt|MolvaM: norths 2@c could be the gazilli convention that several pairs play these days|pg||
nt|MolvaM: showing either a natural @c rebid or some sort of strong hand|pg||
nt|ftpe: hearts 5-2, so only 5 spades here|pg||
nt|aap00: so 4 is reasonable contract|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer has some sort of chance to ditch a diamond on one of the black suits. A diamond finesse and a heart break would then give him a chance.|pg||
nt|brolucius: South's signal on the top-club lead deterred Lauria from cashing his other high club, thereby giving declarer a diamond discard. Buit the @DK is wrong anyway.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Vladimir was in Warsaw Poland in 2006 and in Antalya 2007 with reasonable ranking, however this time surprised to his line|pg||
nt|h_karluk: *Antalya Turkiye|pg||
nt|aldek: Brink nie docenil Bala|pg||

nt|8252: Les 3 premières donnes sont plates heureusement, parce que la salle ouverte ne semble pas avoir démarré|pg||
nt|riccho: humorlose Reizung der Gegner dann... |pg||
nt|udo: sieht wasserdicht aus|pg||
nt|odysseus69: yes it will - thot hK was automatic|pg||
pc|dT|nt|h_karluk: he is supposed to count and protect himself endplayed|pg||
nt|roswolf: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/runningscores/asp/roundteamsconditstatclassicmod.asp?qtournid=820&qshowflag=1|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, 11 tricks|pg||
pc|d5|nt|andreasw:  yes.. 10 tricks next board:p|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer has 10 top tricks and 3 losers with no discards|pg||
nt|bagman: He has tested spades; not 5-0, claim time|pg||
nt|andreasw:  right!|pg||
nt|bagman: There is no way that defense would NOT play hearts, if he tries diamond to 9|pg||
nt|athene: east decides that diamonds are the most likely trick source for his side|pg||
nt|jkotor: why K@h automatic?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: great start for Italy|pg||
pc|d4|nt|eweber: o.k., sorry|pg||
nt|davidb: good stop as 3NT -only 8 tricks|pg||
nt|santyclz: 6 imps to France on board 2 for going + in both rooms.  |pg||
nt|othered1: it's difficult to stay out of this game, unless west opens strong NT and east chooses not to act, vulnerable.|pg||
nt|lesh: should take much longer before claiming|pg||
nt|andersk: Kinda stragne 2 @C and 4@H bid from Charlie here, I would prefeer 4@H over 1 @H opening, isnt that what the hand is wurth?|pg||
nt|lesh: certainly 4@H would do the job. I dont think North would dbl|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this might make, or it might go down - that covers most possibilities |pg||
nt|mdgraham: but should make now, even if NS get a spade ruff, as a diamond can be discarded on @CK|pg||
nt|ralfwil: walter the valrus had made this easy - double with a voice of thunder - (Mollo)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Please no cricket scores on the screen, since I am recording it.|pg||
nt|babs59: is the contract really 4@C?|pg||
nt|jkotor: .|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|andersk: agree|pg||
nt|ftpe: he now|pg||
nt|aap00: in brd 2 W(!) pushed to 3nt... |pg||
pc|s4|nt|h_karluk: declarer for sure would try long string|pg||
nt|haans: the more @D he plays the better defense|pg||
nt|h_karluk: we will see |pg||
pc|s7|nt|andersk: 990 now|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Will make now. If S tries to get a @s ruff a @d will disapperar on @cK and if NS takes their @d tricks, no communication|pg||
nt|ady: diamond back|pg||
nt|suketbombi: ye @D back is the best defence tho but @H ( is also good at this satge|pg||
nt|suketbombi: @H9|pg||
pc|sA|nt|chick: bypassing drury may have some kind of subtle implication about strength|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|Gerben42: changed from last time and will change again next time I guess|pg||
nt|andreasw:  3nt 11 trick's finessing @d|pg||
nt|othered1: i.e, it's a game virtually everyone will get to|pg||
nt|mdgraham: perhaps the real contract is 3NT|pg||
nt|ady: east cant be sure    but 9@H ok    |pg||
nt|psridhar: i think a jump cue 3H over 1s x -showing a 4 trump , invitnal raise is ok|pg||
pc|sK|nt|athene: lauria's negative double over 2@D warned south off getting involved with his spade suit|pg||
nt|oleberg: Then again, he might not :)|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: bad news has arrived from the trumps|pg||
nt|oleberg: Nridge is easier, when you can see all four hands|pg||
nt|tokay1975: now easy 11|pg||
pc|s3|nt|aap00: for me strange, with 10hcp and passed pd |pg||
nt|haans: not easy clubs finesse|pg||
pc|s5|nt|lmeili: if S ducks @dA|pg||
nt|bagman: I would guess that declarer discards a club on the hearts and gives 2 spades and 2 hearts|pg||
nt|athene: Sementa is prepared to lose his @HK to hold declarer to one heart winner rather than two|pg||
nt|bagman: Sementa's duck gives defense 3 spades instead of 2 spades|pg||
nt|brolucius: A high spot-card (@C7) is discouraging, against both suit and NT contracts. (Reverse attitude).|pg||
nt|justin c: leaving the @C suit blocked to keep entry to @HQJ|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a @s lead was defeating|pg||
nt|jkotor: polish or english comment here?|pg||
nt|psridhar: tho it leads to a minus here|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I agree - lets the defence signal very comfortably|pg||
nt|h_karluk: the only possibility to make this a thrown-in play with misdefense of West|pg||
nt|aap00: so, "well deserved" -5 impls|pg||
nt|yusufb: turkish|pg||
nt|pikonlu: turkish|pg||
nt|jkotor: oh|pg||
pc|c3|nt|haans: @H6 even|pg||
nt|odysseus69: I hate that 2C option - it just interferes with big hand with too little damage to oppo on weak hands|pg||
nt|j li: Schön den treffschnapper verhindert, aber einen zweiten Treffstich gibt es trotzdem nicht|pg||
pc|cK|nt|peachy: NS 1H opening might not be everybody's choice, but they play 4-card majors, light style|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: he will ruff a @H & open the clubs guess !|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer keeps the @SA as an entry in case he needs to finesse E for @HT|pg||
nt|suketbombi: he did not have @C count I think|pg||
pc|c5|nt|peachy: oops, he overcalled!|pg||
nt|ziff:  I must confess that I would not sell the E hand as 9+, but Entscho s judgement has always been somewhat different....|pg||
nt|h_karluk: pitch the spade and lose the board|pg||
nt|mdgraham: can you shed any light please operator?|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|MolvaM: this is a 630 or 660 hand for the field to rest their grey cells|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Thor Erik was in San Remo 2009, i guess evil made him do that double|pg||
pc|hT|nt|andersk: will probably go down|pg||
nt|oleberg: Well, a double with a voice of thunder might not have been good. It might make if nort's strength is known|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's frustrating to get overboard when you have good cards (South's)|pg||
pc|h9|nt|athene: he will carry on with the time-honoured antidote to a 4-4 trump fit - keep leading trumps|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer can play N to have AQx and make now 10 tricks|pg||
pc|hK|nt|peachy: ignore everything I said, please :)|pg||
nt|bagman: Or W can let N to have @SQ|pg||
nt|athene: declarer probably thinks the club is offside|pg||
nt|athene: he will try and endplay north|pg||
nt|athene: duck another spade now, perhaps|pg||
nt|bagman: The @C-finesse working is an extra bonus|pg||
nt|andersk: maybe, I cant see what damage ¤@H direct might couse|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|xenya: i'm told there are no commentators in the open room, so I think i'll switch over there|pg||
nt|ftpe: now he plays safe|pg||
nt|aap00: oh, yes me too |pg||
nt|kdr_fm: W praying that @dT9 .... arghhh :>|pg||
nt|barnets: perhaps the hackets will bid 5@D they like to bid|pg||
nt|babs59: I dislike mixing strong bids and weak bids... as with the multi 2@D having a strong option.  That also hinders the preemptive nature of the 2@D multi |pg||
pc|d9|nt|haans: they do not show count|pg||
nt|andersk: Time to give @c count for East now|pg||
pc|d8|pc|h4|nt|haans: @DK must be cover both other suits|pg||
nt|andreasw:  now take @d finesse|pg||
nt|aap00: thotught it's OR :) |pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|andersk: finally|pg||
nt|andreasw:  can't hurt|pg||
nt|aap00: bye |pg||
nt|h_karluk: +1|pg||
nt|lesh: well with 7points and 5th support, I dont think drury was very appropriate|pg||
nt|h_karluk: S4SX+1|pg||
nt|justin c: many off now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Because then the opponents can't make anything|pg||
nt|idc: I like to use that for mixed raises: a hand between a preempt and a cue bid of opps suit|pg||

nt|mdgraham: spade lead at trick 1 not unreasonable - North may well have an entry of sorts on the auction|pg||
nt|ralfwil: agree Mike|pg||
nt|mdgraham: now there's something you don't see very often - a classic pre-empt|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and will W pass?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: would be quite a view to pass, with those good spades  -doesn't need much for game|pg||
nt|brolucius: N/S are happy to write down 620 anyway, hoping for something good at the other table.|pg||
nt|brolucius: 1NT good-14 to 17 points.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: I suspect that we will stay well ahead of Open Room and wont be able to enjoy knowing any results in advance|pg||
nt|bagman: I think that they are happy to write 620 instead of -100 wihout worrying about the other table|pg||
nt|skaftij:  West led @c Queen in 6@h so only 200|pg||
nt|odysseus69: well not automatic but natural|pg||
nt|athene: west has a double of 1@H, i suppose|pg||
nt|jkotor: me to for X|pg||
nt|athene: ok, so he would like another spade, but he wasn't dealt it, so what is there to do?|pg||
mb|1S|nt|eweber: with no bulletin online so far informations spread slowly|pg||
nt|justin c: presumably|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: this could be a thin slam|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: a 7/2/2/2 Nt by East interesting |pg||
nt|haans: Finals words: willwats: could ruff out the q if 2nd,3rd or 4th,  finesse only neccassary if 5-1 or 6-0|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: block 2@D  by S so no transfer by West|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: North looks like a 3@D bid|pg||
nt|udo: nice 4 @H for EW|pg||
nt|lesh: N/S might appear to be in 4@s|pg||
nt|h_karluk: it helps you to know 3 or 4 cards support and to test whether sound or light opening there|pg||
nt|lesniak: czyli cos w tym bylo|pg||
nt|bogier: jak to mówi¹ "arcymistrze"- taka by³a struktura karty :)|pg||

nt|pikolo: obstawiam 4kier z kontr¹|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2@C will not work well by South. No, he has passed.|pg||
nt|idc: Denmark gained 7 on Bd 2 when the OR Danes made life tough for their opps, but some of those IMPs may go back on that last Bd|pg||
mb|3S|nt|peachy: fast pace at this table|pg||
nt|cameron_1: X?|pg||
nt|shevek: coffee hand, brb :)|pg||
nt|jkotor: operator, do we know 3@c meaning?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but will S be quiet?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Quite common to play that two of a major via Stayman is invitational now. That restricts the option of bidding 2@C on South's shape.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: some advocate Stayman with 4-4 knowing at least a 4-3 fit - would not have been good idea here|pg||
nt|bagman: South has enough to be dummy in NT; no need to look for an 'escape'|pg||
nt|barnets: does not look north is destined for success here|pg||
mb|p|nt|eweber: 2@c precision style again|pg||
nt|lmeili: looks like 12 tricks in NT|pg||
nt|cameron_1: seems trange|pg||
nt|mamos: prsumably majors|pg||
nt|mamos: and or values   "competitive"|pg||
nt|cameron_1: i was referign to David's initial choice of 2@c rather than X|pg||
nt|mamos: from an english poerspective these Queens all look to be in the wrong places  opponents hands rather than theirs|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: no he stayed still Vul danger|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but use it moderate , 10 goodish or minimum 11 required|pg||

nt|justin c: this is a nice 6@S|pg||

nt|barnets: england hit the front 5-0|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: lavinthal|pg||
nt|yuval10: 4@h here is actually easier, but 4@s will prevail, too|pg||
nt|yuval10: in 4@h you can discard 2@s's over the KQ@c|pg||
nt|tomi2:  do you play 1@S as 5 cards here?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: iceland lies at the top of the table with 2 more days to go|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 1 more match today and 6 matches the next days|pg||
nt|MolvaM: top 9 ranked teams will qualify for the second stage|pg||
nt|MolvaM: then teams will play a round robin with the teams coming from the other group|pg||
nt|ftpe: south is looking for 6 spades, but cant win here|pg||
nt|haans: 3@C full of danger|pg||
nt|haans: 2@D may have been trf|pg||
nt|haans: more logical|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: not in this position |pg||
nt|haans: but bidding @D twice is?|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: but one never knows in this game |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: what a parnership can bild up |pg||
nt|psridhar: Hi all|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: big think there by N |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: hi |pg||
nt|haans: only 40 hcp exist|pg||
nt|psridhar: two high class pairs facing each other -should be an absorbing contest|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 5@D can be made true will see where he ends up|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes only way to make 5@H there|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Dbl by North shows 3@hs|pg||
pc|c4|nt|rnmalik: but for the @S finesse had a good chance to make it.|pg||
nt|roswolf: never likely to be bid though|pg||
nt|brolucius: You see how light South's 2@S response is. Everyone does that nowadays, to allow partner to compete if he has extra trump-length. In the Bad Old Days, a raise to 2@S was considered ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: a 'free bid' (particularly in the USA) and promised a king's ransom.|pg||
nt|udo: and 4 @S NS  |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 3@D= bergen |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 4@S = 10/11 tricks |pg||
nt|j li: Mir gefällt 3SA statt 4@H|pg||
nt|riccho: Würde jeder 3@h auf 2@s reizen hier? |pg||
nt|psridhar: no drury avoiding the 3 level on a 8 card fit ?|pg||
nt|idc: Roland, which Schaltz is that in OR?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Fancy stuff like Drury is not on the CC it appears|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Peter|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Gerben42: if thats not a minimum hand I never saw one|pg||
nt|davidb: normal  450 . will be flat all over I believe|pg||
nt|haans: yes both both clear for second rr|pg||
nt|brolucius: Italy has reached game on 4, I am told.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: dont agree about multi - its just which strong options are included - |pg||
pc|c7|nt|mcarroll: Lebensohl|pg||
nt|andersk: must be the best weak 2 ever|pg||
nt|yuval10: 4+|pg||
nt|tomi2:  Hackett raised to 3@S with only 3 cad support. I play a cuebid by overcaller as 3 card support raise with maximum here, so 3@S would always be 4 cards for me|pg||
nt|yuval10: seem like a nice agreement|pg||
nt|yuval10: you have to play over the @h's in 4@s|pg||
nt|yuval10: Alfredo Versace is going down in 4@s in his match|pg||
nt|udo: 4@H is ok played from W|pg||
nt|aldek: ghestem|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: kiedy Rumiñski objasnia³ rêkê swojego partnera który otworzy³ 1 karo 0-7..."partner ma bardzo silna rêk¹" ...jak to jak jest slaby? Ma bardzo siln¹ rêkê w ramach swojego otwarcia|pg||

nt|ady: 3@S  a good part score save|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|haans: yepsry|pg||
nt|yuval10: means that this contract isn't so easy |pg||
nt|mamos: this all looks odd|pg||
nt|MolvaM: while the results from their own group will be carried over|pg||
nt|xenya: well if N just had @HA instead of the King... |pg||
nt|lesh: 2@c prec, 2@s non forcing.However South has a decent hand he tried 4@s|pg||
nt|lesh: it also put pressure on the oppoinents and they might as here bid 5@d|pg||
nt|snetram:  moÅ¼e byÄ imponujacy wyÅcig, ale nie musi|pg||
nt|jkotor: E bêdzie musia³ nadbijaæ kara|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: Assuming 4@d shows a good 4@s bid maybe with 3 trumps and 4 iron clad tricks N is worth a 4@h Slam try ...|pg||
nt|barnets: a zia play play your wekest suit|pg||
nt|barnets: weakest|pg||
nt|bagman: With diamond lead, 4@H would have been near impossible. 3NT requires now the hearts to provide 5 tricks|pg||
nt|udo: passen kommt nicht in Frage, für mich|pg||
nt|idc: Thanks|pg||
pc|s5|nt|eweber: 2NT was nat, nf|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I would open 1 @S with that hand|pg||
nt|ady: apart from spades behaving  would need to guess diamond rightr   a poor slam|pg||
nt|Walddk1: http://tinyurl.com/ebc-open-b   http://tinyurl.com/ebc-open-a   http://tinyurl.com/3yl8spu  for running Euro scores |pg||

nt|ryskiel_: Armstrong or Contador?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I vote for 12|pg||
nt|ady: unlikely to be doubled   so just -50|pg||
pc|s2|nt|peachy: with trumps not splitting, this will be tough to play, unless of course EW bids again (I doubt it)|pg||
nt|wygbe1: 6d is pretty  good, but the cards are not friendly|pg||
nt|lmeili: 3@c says 9+ red cards not min hand|pg||
nt|lmeili: tx Rado, 3@s may show sington @c|pg||
nt|tomi2:  what would you lead here?|pg||
nt|lmeili: probably @d, not @s not @h not @c|pg||
nt|tomi2:   seems to cause communication problems, but I cant Imagine to lead a @D from jxx|pg||
nt|motu: i guess i would lead a@H|pg||
nt|tomi2:  seems like a good idea too, in case S has also a singleton you cut this communication|pg||
nt|ziff:  I hope for a @D (obviously), but would lead a @H myself|pg||
nt|motu: with 3@C showing 9 red cards a @D lead looks unatraktiv for me|pg||
nt|haans: Blue Clubs with 5-c M|pg||
nt|cameron_1: I guess Tom chickened out and assumed David was under pressure picking a short major, even so|pg||
nt|ftpe: rigth|pg||
nt|ftpe: 3 spade is probably min and 3-carder in sp|pg||
nt|haans: holy ...|pg||
nt|udo: 4@S NS is beatable NS, but only with the unlikely @D lead|pg||
nt|bagman: Attacking his weakest suit hoping the defense plays one of the stronger|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Italy got hearts in first in Open Room and reached 4 hearts|pg||

nt|cameron_1: I think the problem started with Daid's initial choice of 2@c|pg||
nt|cameron_1: rather than X|pg||
nt|aldek: or pass|pg||
nt|cameron_1: the ebu didnt pay it table money to watch him pass|pg||

nt|jameslee 2: we have in this days so many bergen types all bettween 0-11 points with 3 or 4 card support |pg||
nt|brolucius: Gold will try to look worried if they switch to diamonds at some stage.|pg||
nt|babs59: It's just my opinion, and I don't like 2@C having the GF and weak option, similarly|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes curiouly if 3 rounds of @Hs ate played declerer will end up making 3@S but no chance here|pg||
nt|suketbombi: opening lead 3 rounds of @H|pg||
nt|ady: why would it make with 3 rounds of hearts|pg||
nt|riccho: Ja sicher. W hätte ja noch KJxx haben können|pg||
nt|riccho: Ich finde 3@h jdf. auch nicht als ungefährlich|pg||
nt|psridhar: if the defense picks up the h ruff now they will repeat their 200 acquisition now|pg||
nt|idc: I see the Italians take the view that CC info is to some extent voluntary :)|pg||
nt|idc: one pair doesn't seem to have one|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Peter Schaltz has played more than 500 internationals for the open team. So the fact that he has now joined the seniors makes that team stronger|pg||
nt|psridhar: it is certainly sub-optimal to be forced to raise to 3s on that N hand|pg||
nt|psridhar: even assuming the 3rd seat opening is not mischievous|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Berg is a naturalist. He is not a fan of too many gadgets|pg||
pc|c2|nt|peachy: I dont think even 5 makes|pg||
nt|peachy: but 5 Is certainly reasonable bid, |pg||
nt|andreasw:  and endplay is up|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: there we go 5@D X all |pg||
nt|h_karluk: 5@d likely doubled off three, unless @cK works in some way|pg||
pc|c8|nt|brolucius: South can visualize a club ruff after the E/W club bidding.|pg||
nt|andersk: even better to get 200|pg||
nt|chick: turning a small plus into a big minus :(|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|haans: good opening VUL|pg||
nt|andersk: I open 2 @S, but my openings are 9-13|pg||
nt|MolvaM: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/runningscores/asp/roundteamsconditstatclassicmod.asp?qtournid=819&qshowflag=1|pg||
nt|psridhar: If north had raised diamonds at his first turn -3d over 2S- he would have avoided bidding at 4 level on his own , like he did here|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: the card play to position of the AQ@H guess|pg||
nt|tomi2:  Lauria cold pitch the @HQ|pg||
nt|tomi2:  @SQ|pg||
nt|andersk: 500|pg||
nt|andersk: sorry|pg||
nt|lesh: well 5@s isnt the best call|pg||
nt|aldek: jako junior Bas Drijver byl bardzo ostroznym graczem|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|Gerben42: Rudakov removed because of the @S problem, not because of his good suit|pg||
nt|wygbe1: play off 3 top clubs pitching h's and let e ruff|pg||
nt|peachy: declarer is likely to adopt that line, but then he has to deal with the H, S and club losers in hand|pg||
nt|peachy: might turn out too tuff|pg||
nt|wygbe1: yes, the line that works is to just ruff the 2 low clubs in dummy and draw trumps, finessing against d jack|pg||
nt|wygbe1: even that could run into difficulty|pg||
nt|h_karluk: oh yes, now i liked more Lawrence's Law of total tricks |pg||
nt|odysseus69: as a founder member of the multi society I suggest including only strong 4-4-4-1 hands as the only strong option|pg||
nt|odysseus69: will do well to find a way to 9 tricks here|pg||
nt|babs59: :)   I was referring to the strong 2NT option that gets included in Australia - which inhibits preempting in majors|pg||
nt|babs59: It will require Versace magic I feel|pg||
pc|s4|nt|andersk: If not I open 1|pg||
nt|mdgraham: maybe @HK, heart ruff, @CA -  |pg||
nt|bagman: Bochi might place N with 4 carder in @H|pg||
nt|odysseus69: second club looks natural|pg||
nt|babs59: Russia is in 4@SX on board 3|pg||
nt|mdgraham: may play diamond to J and ace, and lead a diamond towards the South hand - finesse 9?|pg||
nt|bagman: Soon declarer plays a spade to the A and takes the heart finesse for his contract|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And Jørgensen forgets them anyway :)|pg||
pc|sT|nt|haans: dim 2-2 big plus|pg||
nt|haans: @HQ double right|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: he guess correctly seems like @D 2/2 helps sure does|pg||
nt|haans: 2nd opinion: ronsheffy: makes!!!|pg||
nt|tomi2:  so versace now could signal a spade in his ruff|pg||
nt|idc: and what could be more natural than a minus score?|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|brolucius: An even discard (@D10) is discouraging in that suit.|pg||
nt|cumino: I doubt|pg||
nt|suketbombi: a diamond endplay but ok can give R&D so never makes|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|andersk: yes|pg||
nt|peachy: In any case, they avoided the hopeless slam in this room.|pg||
nt|jkotor: a Sjoert zawsze gra³ ostro!|pg||
nt|odysseus69: cant release heart so D or S from dummy - doesnt want to throw either|pg||
pc|s6|nt|Gerben42: the 4-1 break means that 2@S NS wont make either|pg||
nt|wygbe1: the slam is actually not bad with reasonable splits, but here the splits are not good|pg||

nt|yuval10: not an easy game at all, it was|pg||
nt|yuval10: and now for a goulash hand|pg||
nt|tomi2:  I think 1@C is 2+@C for the German pair|pg||
nt|bagman: In the late 80's  passing out a deal was nearly impossible|pg||
nt|athene: EW might be able to create some confusion|pg||
nt|athene: with 11 -card spade fit|pg||
nt|antoniz: odzyskujemy przewagê psychiczn¹:)|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: after 5 hands |pg||
mb|p|nt|collins64: Mike is going to open 2@c with a weak major 2-suiter|pg||
nt|h_karluk: echo|pg||
nt|lechcold: przed 13 jest..poszli na wodê jednak:)|pg||
nt|ady: 6@H  e/w|pg||
nt|psridhar: 4 queens and 2 jacks made up the 21 hcp that NS held-they are overvalued in the hcp method|pg||
mb|2H|nt|Gerben42: weak 2 in @D|pg||
nt|Gerben42: refreshingly natural|pg||
nt|eweber: there is a tiny little chance of an endplay vs South|pg||
nt|wygbe1: guess i missed something, down 1 looked pretty easy|pg||
nt|yuval10: really hard to predict what the final outcome here will be|pg||
nt|tomi2:  am no fan of double and no fan of redouble here. what contract does Della Monta want to play doubled, iff ops bid it?|pg||
nt|yuval10: X from S is dangerous in the sense that sometimes P will pass and you have very few defensive tricks for him|pg||
nt|tomi2:  yes|pg||
nt|roswolf: another straightforward board|pg||
nt|bagman: p-p|pg||
nt|athene: 2@S must be a takeout |pg||
nt|bagman: S is confident in his methods|pg||
nt|athene: takeout of spades|pg||
nt|fokal: 2@d shows @s , strong or weak|pg||
nt|fokal: hi all by the way|pg||
nt|athene: maybe 2@S is specifically michaels|pg||
nt|bagman: Is it T/O or 2-suiter?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi.|pg||
nt|athene: many pairs play "leaping michaels" over these bids, so 4@D would be reds|pg||
nt|bagman: hi|pg||
nt|fokal: so I guess 2@s shows a two suiters for sure|pg||
nt|athene: maybe NS don't play that or maybe south prefers to treat his hand as a 3-suiter|pg||
nt|bagman: N has an easy raise of the q-bid :)|pg||
nt|bagman: if methods permit such treatment|pg||
nt|hawe45:  So - I was late from another match|pg||
nt|athene: north pretty much just wants to RKCB in hearts|pg||
nt|athene: but he might have to set hearts first|pg||
nt|MolvaM: double now?|pg||
nt|andreasw:  1@s and 4@h after 3nt|pg||
nt|udo: 7@D|pg||
nt|udo: or NT|pg||
nt|udo: lets see|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is natural to bid 4@H rather than 5@C because it is a trick less. When the opponents go to 4@S and you want to bid at the five-level, you have a free choice between hearts and ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: clubs.|pg||
nt|8252: tu as donc 2 pseudos|pg||
nt|ralfwil: As you said Mike a classic preempt with a good result|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: denmark on lead 8-0 Iceland|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: hand nº 6 |pg||
nt|oleberg: 1@D shows 11-15, 4+ diamonds, can have longer clubs|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: seems a 4@H by West|pg||
nt|oleberg: (No, I'm not guessing :))|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this 3N is a bit easier|pg||
nt|Walddk12: Welcome to Eric Robinson|pg||
nt|suketbombi: nice 6@H here inspite of @S watages|pg||
nt|skaftij:  West has a lot in reserve|pg||
nt|skaftij:  2NT GF, @h fit|pg||
nt|riccho: hmm|pg||
nt|idc: 2@h is a weak M-m two suiter|pg||
nt|idc: 5-4+|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: i agree with those 2 arguments you made|pg||
nt|shevek: neither side can make game|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 3nt seems not makable|pg||
nt|tomi2:  lauria only needs to find partner with two aces here, should be possible to find|pg||
nt|corplaw: hi |pg||
nt|bagman: Hi|pg||
mb|p|nt|ziff:  In a marked contrast to our table Scotland and Italy have won 40 and 46 IMP in 5 boards.....|pg||
nt|lmeili: they should reach to 4@h, 1@c-1@d , 1N 2@c|pg||
nt|tomi2:  sometimes pd will jump to 2 level with 4 cards only and you have a hard bidding later|pg||
nt|tomi2:  os della Monatas hand now worth a raise to 6?|pg||
nt|yuval10: i believe W must add now....P is willing to play in the 5 level ALONE when he's VUL, and you have AK A?|pg||
nt|tomi2:  AKtx of trumps and the ace in their suit?|pg||
nt|yuval10: *she's|pg||
nt|yuval10: very likely that we'll see a sacrifice from NS|pg||
nt|tomi2:  if S bids 5@D now w has a difficult bid|pg||
nt|yuval10: Pass forcing?|pg||
nt|tomi2:  E-W are clearly in a forcing pass situation, but do you pass with TWO small dias?|pg||
nt|roswolf: unless n/s get carried away|pg||
nt|davidb: yes  no  great  boards yet...|pg||
nt|ady: can make 6NT    6@S  beaten on heart lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: the axe might descend here|pg||
nt|davidb: ??  aces...|pg||
nt|bagman: Ok, now let's see how the void is shown|pg||
nt|cameron_1: might chooce 4@s since Drijver's X was prob snapfragon style i.e. 2@s 5@c|pg||
nt|aldek: double showing clubs and a doubleton spade|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@D is natural. She has one diamond, so opens One Diamond.|pg||
nt|oleberg: And a good save in 4@S|pg||
nt|oleberg: Ok, a save|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: a block 3@S by N|pg||
nt|brolucius: Well, it was quite interesting how Gold approached the play - attacking his weakest suit first. |pg||
nt|odysseus69: a boring looking affair here|pg||
nt|odysseus69: can they look for a slam?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: dont think so|pg||
nt|andreasw:  hi Eric|pg||
nt|riccho: In Bd. 4 haben die Russen die Verteidigung gegen Vollspiel "gefunden". 4 Imps für die guten... |pg||
mb|d|nt|athene: it's never easy to bid a grand slam which depends on a void (i.e. where you are off an ace)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: still a possible 5 imps missed|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2NT overcall most likely, but Berg is going for the kill|pg||
nt|idc: At these colours, I like North's pass - now if only South protects|pg||
mb|p|nt|eweber: but NS can escape by cashing their tricks|pg||
nt|lmeili: 2@h 3@h|pg||
nt|haans: close to spade raise|pg||
nt|yuval10: you have to do something with this AKTX trump and A@h|pg||
nt|cameron_1: choose a game i guess, a little strange because most use that to claim "ownership" and show a good hand|pg||
nt|mamos: what strength was 2@h   do we know - forcing ?|pg||
nt|mamos: will england bid on ?|pg||
nt|andreasw:  3nt should not win yes|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: could East X ?|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: can it be 3 card suport?|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: West can go alone to 5@H|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 5@H=11 tricks |pg||
nt|brolucius: England supporters can hope so.|pg||
nt|ady: 3@C   2nd suit     a bit dangerous with that holding|pg||
nt|ady: 4@C a cu   now 4@D?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Does Jørgensen have enough to balance with a double?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He has|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: he ruffed H with the Q, unnecessary|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like another boring hand|pg||
nt|lechcold: dziêki wejciu Brinka nasi dojd¹ do 3BA|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 3@C is more likely some kind of relay I guess|pg||
nt|udo: 4@S EW,,,,,,5@H N/S wird schon zu teuer, wenn man in @C falsch rät ( klein zur 9 )|pg||
nt|psridhar: Cedolin might hv liked XX, AXXXX,X,AQXXX for that opening but he didnt deal that hand :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: empting to Dbl with S hand|pg||
nt|peachy: tempting|pg||
nt|andersk: If 5@C makes, then 3 NT makes too|pg||
nt|bagman: If N can ask aces, S can bid quite a lot|pg||
nt|athene: did south think 4nt was asking for the minor?|pg||
nt|fokal: sementa has no idea of the @s void , he might try to protect his K of @s|pg||
nt|fokal: by bidding NT|pg||
nt|bagman: Now 5@S, I guess|pg||
nt|fokal: obvisously S interpreted 4NT as 'what is your minor , partner ? '|pg||
nt|athene: they might scramble into the grand if south finds 5@S now|pg||
nt|hawe45:  What was 2 @S exactly?|pg||
nt|bagman: It's bad to have your misunderstanding on a grand slam deal|pg||
nt|athene: but if there really has been a misunderstanding it's asking a lot to recover and go on to bid a tricky seven|pg||
nt|athene: 2@D showed spades, weak or strong (or some monster balanced)|pg||
nt|athene: so 2@S was obviously a cue - whatever they play that as|pg||
nt|hawe45:  So 5 @S now might do...|pg||
nt|cameron_1: i imagine tom was happy not to have to guess over an immediate 4@s from Brink|pg||
nt|MolvaM: thomas bids what he hopes he can make|pg||
nt|MolvaM: reasonable bid but doesnt work today|pg||
nt|MolvaM: but maybe pushes opps to 4@h|pg||
nt|xenya: 2N promises 20+|pg||
nt|Walddk2: His suit might not be solid :)|pg||
nt|lechcold: i wygraj¹|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 6T aurait eu une chance de gagner si E avait cache ses coeurs, mais evidemment 2C est 100% normale|pg||
nt|marlowepi: a cartes ouvertes c'est faisable meme sans entame coeur, mais le dec fera les deux impasses perdantes|pg||
nt|odysseus69: but maybe some exchanges|pg||
nt|cumino: J@D for a good slam instead of Q@C|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, I expect they will do their duty - taking a look for a slam - and then stop in game.|pg||
nt|bagman: Slam requires the spades to come in and diamond guess|pg||
nt|bagman: I have made worse slams |pg||
nt|babs59: more points, more substance to suits :)|pg||
nt|bagman: Even with @DA lead and @DK ruffed, 4@H makes as the @SA falls|pg||
nt|j li: Und schon wieder geht es nur um Überstiche|pg||
pc|sK|nt|rigas_karo: 4@s in 5-1 fit in the oper room, probably +1|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: looks like an easy 3NT|pg||
nt|boyklas: its difficult to find the Jxx after this bidding, except if he lead it|pg||
nt|ady: should south double if they get to 6@S    might remove to 6NT|pg||
nt|psridhar: difficult to bid 5d on their own last bd- needed push from oppo|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: a part score 2@S by West|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so W missed to find 4/4 hearts fit|pg||
nt|odysseus69: yes - that would be good- but no wasted club cards is what West needs |pg||
nt|yusufb: eller dengesiz geliyo butun maçlarda ilk 4 bordda baya alýþveriþ olmuþ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good decision, unlucky lead|pg||
pc|s2|nt|wygbe1: yep it is|pg||
nt|Walddk12: Good morning to Paul Hackett|pg||
nt|wygbe1: and it was |pg||
nt|ady: problem is not there|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w were merciful but have missed the boat somewhat|pg||
nt|cameron_1: it is usally right to bid on know double fit hands|pg||
nt|tomi2:  but he should not bid 4nt too fast, because it could be keycard for spades, and partner would sell @SAK and no @CA as two aces|pg||
nt|andersk: 4@S is makeable, but <i do not understand why Charlie didnt look for @H suit first|pg||
nt|andersk: need to do something good in @s to make|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: hand 5 other room playing 4@S same contract|pg||
nt|ady: kib said 3@C minimum pt count|pg||
pc|sT|nt|tomi2:  not hackett should bid 5@H rather than double I think|pg||
nt|ady: sorry    blind spot    2 aces missing|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: can go -1 with a good defence timming|pg||
nt|odysseus69: heavy 2D bid for English style|pg||
nt|suketbombi: wonder 4@S was a que or an exclusion key card BW|pg||
nt|barnets: poland in 4@S where Italy made 5@C|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: well this is an easy way :)|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Morning everyone|pg||
nt|peachy: Good morning Paul|pg||
nt|wygbe1: morning|pg||
nt|yuval10: very interesting sequence to work with your partner|pg||
nt|bagman: When a misunderstaning occurs, it's difficult to recover, because neither player knows what the misunderstanding has been|pg||
nt|athene: even if both players suspect, neither one can be sure his partner is in on the secret|pg||
nt|bagman: If N thinks that S has 1 ace and @S-void, he still cannot bid the grand|pg||
nt|athene: these sort of auctions are where top pairs really have to put in the time away from the table|pg||
nt|athene: because there are lots of imps riding on these hands|pg||
nt|lechcold: ogranicznie nie znoszê takich wejæ:)...|pg||

nt|aldek: ale w holandii nie moge nikogo przekonac ze to sensu nie ma|pg||
nt|8252: c'est mieux comme ça, l'entame @h donnait la 12 ème, mais DAFILO n'aurait pas filé|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 11 trickd from top as @dJ is Jxx|pg||
nt|mdgraham: This hand would be perfect for Christmas Party bridge - One Diamond, Two Spades, Three Hearts, Three NoTrump |pg||
nt|mdgraham: Natural Bidding|pg||
nt|ady: 6@D     one control + a void?|pg||
nt|j li: +2, beide @Hverlierer verschwinden auf die Karos|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Wrong king|pg||
pc|c3|nt|boyklas: thats true|pg||

pc|c2|nt|Gerben42: this contract will be no problem, will duck once to guard against 5-2 @C|pg||
nt|ziff:  2@Sx would have been 3 down at least on a @D lead or switch, but not easy to find, and 620 are available|pg||
nt|star6ija: 11 tricks|pg||
nt|antoniz: Adam zagra przez trefle z powodów komunikacyjnych|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Good evening to Peter Gill|pg||
nt|brolucius: If West shows any interest in a slam (no, I see he has signed off), East would go there with three aces.|pg||
nt|ozgull: bu masada çok hýzlý oynanýyor|pg||
nt|bagman: Maybe not so unlucky as W was likely to have very short spades|pg||
nt|corplaw: N was probably going down in 4S, so sac was a phantom|pg||
pc|c8|nt|paulhac:  It is a playable game just but not with the trump break they did well to only go 1 off in the othere room|pg||
nt|lmeili: after 1@c 1@d what is 1N shows? some player holds 7 HCP as E they may not inv to game|pg||
nt|andersk: this will be -2 or more|pg||
nt|MolvaM: what about 5@c?|pg||
nt|udo: @D agreed now ?|pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: Czy wygra, to zobaczymy... W jasne karty ³atwo|pg||
nt|psridhar: it is still a 800 /1100 number|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Any other would be fine|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|brolucius: 5@H, cue-bid denying a club control. Now 6@C will show first-round club control.|pg||
pc|cK|nt|wygbe1: playing for 50 hearts, could set up spades and run them through south for down 1, losintg ak of spades and 2 hearts|pg||
nt|h_karluk: -3|pg||
nt|h_karluk: just play off top hearts|pg||
nt|andersk: I know - 3 double dummy, but they dont see all cards:)|pg||
nt|rodvenn: In practice 3@h is a good bid|pg||
nt|h_karluk: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_total_tricks|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer is happy to see this dummy; quite sure make and quite a bad slam|pg||
nt|cumino: But EST is 12-14 bal, there isn't many cards for slam|pg||

nt|aldek: 4@S was close as well|pg||
nt|tomi2:  with 5@H he committses himself to 6 level even if partners @C were QJT, or does 4@S also show @C control?|pg||

nt|xenya: 12 tricks |pg||
nt|ftpe: yes|pg||
nt|ftpe: south should play club|pg||
nt|brolucius: Versace may think: 'I must have club ace to suggest a grand slam (with another spade cue-bid), so this is more accurate, showing @SK too.|pg||

nt|andersk: Do you good people understand the 5@C raise?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: if we are talking abt std signals|pg||
nt|andersk: I would probably try 3 NT|pg||
nt|h_karluk: by N?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: yes lots of game plus - but slam minus  hands|pg||
nt|odysseus69: i should look before I leap|pg||
nt|idc: a trump at some point looks sensible from South|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|eweber: results of round 2 are online by now |pg||
nt|eweber: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/10Ostend/asp/roundteams.asp?qtournid=820&qroundno=2|pg||
nt|eweber: England leading the group with 50(!)|pg||
nt|eweber: Russia 13th with 27|pg||
nt|eweber: NL 17th of 19 with 17|pg||
nt|othered1: But first south recues @S, guaranteeing some kind of @C control, I'd think|pg||
nt|udo: 5@S is ?|pg||
nt|brolucius: He would just bid 6@D with second-round club control.|pg||
nt|tomi2:  5@S = both black aces|pg||
nt|udo: i am told @S king and first round club|pg||
nt|brolucius: Well, he has already shown @SA, hasn't he? (With 4@S).|pg||
nt|tomi2:  probably with no @SK he'd bid 6@C|pg||
nt|brolucius: Indeed.|pg||
nt|udo: and 6@D with second round @C controll?|pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: Teraz to zmusili Go do zrobienia nadróbki...|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mamos: England have done well on this board I feel|pg||
nt|othered1: And Lauria selects the highest scoring (and unbreakable, if partner has 1@D) spot.|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|haans: Bulgaria do not play Blue Clubs but Precision|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: dangerous but works here |pg||
nt|psridhar: true 3h makes -but two eight card fits deterred the pairs from venturing into 3 level -THE LAW :)|pg||
nt|tomi2:  problem is again, waht does he bid with no club control? 5nt is nonforcing?|pg||
pc|c5|nt|boyklas: 4C at te open room? not 4S?|pg||
nt|lmeili: tx, that means they'll reach 4@h any how|pg||
nt|andersk: Need AQxxxxx and almost nothing more for it to be makeable|pg||
nt|roswolf: israel avoided the slam on bd 3 in the other room and so gained 11|pg||
nt|star6ija: yes|pg||
nt|star6ija: no trump is 14-16...and some new gadgets over 1@c openning|pg||
nt|brolucius: But it was West who had the chance to make a try. East was merely following the route to describe 12-14 with three spades.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mcarroll: In a word - No - I do not understand it|pg||
nt|andersk: 3 NT is my choise|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hard to reach there|pg||
nt|andersk: hard to reach 3 NT?|pg||
nt|andersk: Just pull it out of your bidding box:)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: can you make a sample bidding?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: LOL|pg||
nt|h_karluk: it should be played by N|pg||
nt|aldek: could not do better|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hellom Peter|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer could have made the contract by drawing trumps and setting up clubs|pg||
nt|suketbombi: shd be reached in other room too|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|mamos: surely not|pg||
nt|mamos: not @hK|pg||
nt|xenya: but declarer can either get @Ds righ or squeeze N in the reds |pg||
nt|rodvenn: that is not the law as I understand it|pg||
nt|bagman: WIth no transportation possible between the defenders, declarer took the sure way to make his game|pg||
nt|athene: nothing there was so unreasonable but still lots of ways for poland to gain on the board|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: 5@C w 5 tylko bez jednej. 16 IMP|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But he thinks partner has @SQ after the lead|pg||
pc|dK|nt|rnmalik: 9 tricks.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: welcome again.|pg||
nt|arigun: simdi koz oynarisa batiyor galiba|pg||
nt|yusufb: þimdi sýra bizde|pg||
pc|d4|nt|corplaw: because of the very favorable drop of AQJ of clubs|pg||
nt|bagman: Now the rest is easy on cross ruff discarding a diamond on @SK|pg||
pc|d3|nt|rigas_karo: West bid 4@s over 2@h|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: but maybe he bid 4@c to indicate @c +@s and east (reasonably) passed with singleton @s|pg||
nt|collins64: no Filippos opened 2@h with his 6-card J|pg||
nt|andersk: I understan that 3 @S is a tempting bid|pg||
nt|star6ija: this sequence showed 4-4-4-1 singleton not defined, 2N was relay and 3@c showed @d singleton - 4@h denies control outside|pg||
nt|aldek: the operator is in trouble, it seems|pg||
nt|mamos: vugraph op???????   you there?|pg||
nt|xenya: for the same result|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: 3NT might have made iF south led a high heart .... but 4@C is going 4 off|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|collins64: and West bid 4@c with his 55 passed by East|pg||
nt|boyklas: ok, 10 imps for greece|pg||
nt|cameron_1: seems right result|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Wouldn't we all?|pg||
nt|psridhar: S needed to overtake that dia and shoot a h...now defense has lost a trick|pg||
nt|psridhar: still i fancy 500|pg||
nt|idc: South still had a chance - he should perhaps realize that partner is in danger of trump endplays|pg||
nt|psridhar: i wonder why he chose to let the dia king stand; he knows it is not stiff since he led the riskier spd king doubleton|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|rodvenn: two 8-card fits make you compete to the 3-level according to the law|pg||
nt|odysseus69: the only question now is how long it will take for 10 tricks|pg||
pc|s7|nt|andersk: understand|pg||
pc|s6|nt|peachy: good line to keep it down 1q|pg||
nt|haans: will lose 2 clubs|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: jakby bylo bez dwóch o dziwo przyby³by impik|pg||

nt|arigun: tuzak bir board, dekleranin @h uzerine oynamasi gerekiyordu yapabilmesi icin|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|peachy: 1|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Cedolin must have a pretty god picture of the layout and will likely play a club|pg||
nt|idc: To be fair, this is an unnaturally early hour to be playing bridge - 9:30 start local time I believe|pg||
nt|psridhar: he will need to ruff that club nevertheless , else South's tiny trump will score|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Right, in the middle of the night|pg||
nt|idc: At most Irish & Scottish events, last night's parties wouldn't be finished yet|pg||
nt|psridhar: Some would rather see 0930 hrs in their 'night' than in the morning :)|pg||
pc|c6|nt|wygbe1: looks like that is the line adopted|pg||
nt|peachy: without the Dbl, it is not as obvious|pg||
nt|andersk: I type too fast:)|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: to take opps out of the 8 card fit |pg||
nt|haans: 8 carder outside of the law|pg||
nt|h_karluk: thanks to Marty and Larry, sorry for wrong remembered that devised by Mike|pg||
nt|bagman: A heart ruff and two diamond losers were declarer's worries|pg||
nt|brolucius: Now a possible squeeze if North has the two minor-suit kings.|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|hJ|nt|lesh: wrong guess which leads to -1|pg||
nt|idc: nicely done Cedolin|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|d5|pc|d7|nt|jameslee 2: chance for West|pg||
nt|rodvenn: 8 carder is at the core of the law. This is where it starts|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: guessing @C is home |pg||
nt|psridhar: the law says there are as many tricks as there are trumps|pg||
nt|haans: hard to belie he get this chance|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: a good think & decision wil he put the Q@C or not ?|pg||
nt|babs59: similarly board 4 in the OR, 3NT by East (a more 'normal' contract) is taking a long time|pg||
nt|babs59: not prepared to give away overtrick IMPs if avoidable|pg||
nt|odysseus69: safe to play heart finesse|pg||
nt|babs59: I'm told that Poland bid and made 6NT on board 4|pg||
nt|odysseus69: he is thinking of going for 11 with heart jack but cant risk it|pg||
pc|h7|nt|haans: King but be on other side|pg||
nt|psridhar: so if there are two 8 cad fits there are 16 tricks in total|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: he did |pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|psridhar: now he cannot be prevented from scoring 2 more trump tricks for -500 ony|pg||
pc|h2|nt|h_karluk: -3 as i expected|pg||
nt|haans: or not :)|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 2@S = 110 |pg||
nt|psridhar: if your side can 9 of those then they can get only 7 -meaning u go + defending 2 level|pg||
pc|h5|nt|odysseus69: delay puzzling|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ziff:  He could not afford a 2nd trump early, as he lacks a fast entry to hand for the 2nd @C ruff|pg||
nt|motu: hmm i think now it is posible to score the @H9|pg||
nt|lmeili: yes|pg||
nt|ziff:  So he probably had to lead a @D after that first trump, to open up communication|pg||
nt|motu: it was needed to ruff the @C low and than play a @S|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
mc|6|nt|wygbe1: this will also work, playing h nine to force a cover, then ruff club back to hand and play spade toward the last 2 trumps in dummy|pg||

nt|athene: well there's no way anyone is guessing all that|pg||
nt|athene: what they need is some way for north to agree hearts|pg||
nt|athene: then it's relatively easy|pg||
nt|athene: but slam auctions are hard when no-one knows what trumps are|pg||
nt|bagman: I'm sure they'll go back to the drawing board after this match|pg||

nt|yusufb: 4nodan 11 verdik 1@h x 2@h e salvo pas demiþ 6520 la yeni baktým biþeyde anlamadým|pg||
nt|athene: some people open south's hand 1@D intending to rebid 2@C over 1@S|pg||
nt|psridhar: Italy duplicated the earlier 4s for d2 other room|pg||
mb|2H|nt|lesh: a peaceful 4@h here, but lets see|pg||

nt|jkotor: if you play Polish "WJ" with 2@c prec style U have to|pg||
nt|athene: but versace knows which his longest suit is!|pg||
mb|d|nt|wygbe1: several roads to down one, as long as declarer assumes s has all the trumps|pg||
nt|yuval10: NS in the OR found the 6@d sac.|pg||
nt|roswolf: bd2 was flat when 4@S was also allowed to make|pg||

nt|cameron_1: flat borad|pg||

nt|ftpe: ew migth go to 4 he here|pg||
nt|h_karluk: in practice very hard to reach, given layout diamonds favorably placed|pg||

nt|jameslee 2: Spain had some yeterday againtx portugal at football :)|pg||

nt|yuval10: so "only" 5 imps to Austria|pg||
nt|mamos: i think youd want to be in game|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 5c has much chances if declare can manage the 4-0 split|pg||

mb|2N|nt|peachy: 4H rolls now,, on lucky spade sit|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Although the K@S is right the K@D is wrong so 4@H is an excellent contract|pg||
nt|peachy: EW have a paying sacrifice, rare at Vul|pg||
nt|andersk: Might be possible to bid game here|pg||
nt|bagman: If North was confident that 4NT was RKCB in hearts, that was a good bid; no need to re-cue with 3@S|pg||
nt|fokal: but maybe S could (should ?) have bid something else than 6@h|pg||
nt|haans: the law is not the law just suggestions :)|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: another part score hand |pg||
nt|udo: guess after 3 NT Lauria gave him club A or King|pg||
nt|brolucius: If North has a club more and a diamond fewer, he would be delighted to hear of the @SK, which would give a second club discard.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: not guilty Maam :) i was living in an ocean away and the internet was not invented. i was just thirsty and eager to buy any foreign bridge book, thanks |pg||

nt|jameslee 2: straigh away|pg||

nt|peachy: oops|pg||
nt|peachy: I think I need another cup of coffee!!!|pg||

nt|paulhac:  Without a heart ruff|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 4 cards M 4th seat|pg||
nt|andersk: looks like NT has to be played by S, but 5@D makes|pg||

nt|ady: 3NT   for n/s looks normal|pg||
nt|athene: well, it was only good if he was confident and he knew his partner was confident it was, too :)|pg||
nt|athene: that is one strange double of 1@C|pg||
nt|bagman: In confusion, it's often a good idea to bid something, which can be passed )|pg||

nt|petergill: which sounds like "balanced" to me|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 2D must show spades|pg||
nt|koksoy: artýk  yapýlabilecek  en  iyi  sey  3@D  oynamak.|pg||
nt|koksoy: umarým  3@C  doubl lý  kalmaz|pg||
nt|arigun: 3@c yapabili belki|pg||
nt|arigun: yapamaz diyenlere belki dedik olur a defans yardim eder :)|pg||
nt|udo: erneut nicht sonderlich spannend, wenn man in 4 stoppt, was zu schaffen sein müsste|pg||
nt|j li: und jetzt wurde ein slam try daraus|pg||
nt|riccho: ah dann habe ich ja richtig geraten|pg||
nt|udo: 4@D -4@S|pg||
nt|riccho: sieht so aus|pg||
nt|riccho: aber gut zu sehen, dass es kein Zufall ist,  dass man 6@s vermeidet|pg||
mb|p|nt|collins64: after minor opening and opponent's double they play transfer|pg||
nt|yuval10: 5@c is cold, so many imps here on the line perhaps|pg||
nt|MolvaM: hands seem to be quiet, compared to the previous match|pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: Mo¿e wypuszcz¹?|pg||
nt|aldek: ale ostatnio zrezygnowali z tego pomyslu|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: alot of bidding again on a poor 7 count|pg||
nt|barnets: hacketts did bid 5@D as I suggested - will be another england swing|pg||
nt|barnets: not even x|pg||
nt|cumino: 5@d not doubledb board 4|pg||
nt|psridhar: that 3s showed an invitn hand with spds|pg||
nt|idc: I would have expected that too Padmanabhan, but I guess he chose this to invite instead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Somehow the Danes survived boards 4 and 5 when they bid too much in this room. Both flat|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|boyklas: take 5D, 1S, 1H and leave|pg||
nt|lmeili: though 6@d makable, i would prefer for 3N|pg||
nt|tomi2:  they are on their way to 6@D it seems :)|pg||
nt|motu: 4@D is aceasking|pg||
nt|tomi2:  not 4@C?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: no matter @c lead|pg||
nt|andersk: @C A AQ in @S and @H J|pg||
nt|haans: 5@D jump may be based on previous bidding|pg||
nt|MolvaM: no 7600 distribution so far :)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  sry was away for a bid there:)|pg||
nt|ftpe: well ew had play for 4 hearts, but ns bougth contract in 2 cl on 4-3 fit|pg||
nt|barnets: 5@D passed out big swing for england|pg||
nt|yusufb: 3@c naturelmi yada minorlerden birini secmi onu düþünüyo salvo|pg||
nt|bagman: Trump switch unlikely to help as the hearts are so nicely|pg||
pc|c5|nt|eweber: Imp scoring doesn't seem to work, 5 Imps for Russia until Board 4, if I count correctly|pg||
nt|h_karluk: quickly jettison loser|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: good lord even adding T + 9 I cant see how N is worth 3 bids|pg||
nt|brolucius: A clever method, showing spades but not going past the safety level of 2@H.|pg||
pc|c4|nt|motu: 4@C would be aceasking for @S|pg||
nt|tomi2:  but is @S suit possible after not raising?|pg||
nt|lmeili: 4th step shows how many key cards?|pg||
nt|tomi2:  2+@Dq|pg||
nt|motu: 2+ trump Q|pg||
nt|lmeili: tx|pg||
nt|h_karluk: to spades|pg||
nt|h_karluk: overtakes K and enjoys|pg||
nt|roswolf: with the diamonds 3-2 no problem|pg||
nt|udo: must be|pg||
nt|udo: 11 tricks,, next:)|pg||
nt|brolucius: 1@H must have been a transfer but I cannot see anything about it on the conv-card that I have up.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: mais aux yeux fermes|pg||
nt|barnets: so very fast start for england here|pg||
nt|odysseus69: this is going well for England but more significantly for Israel|pg||

nt|paulhac:  Best lead but he could have led anything|pg||
nt|MolvaM: u didnt miss much andreas|pg||
nt|andreasw:  great:)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: declarer tries to protect himself against the 2 diamond honors being offside|pg||
nt|MolvaM: so he just gave up a heart trick that he could establish by taking his @hA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes it is, X would have shown hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They play transfers after interference|pg||
nt|udo: last time i played them ( San Remo),, they played transfers|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think a tad stretched 2@s works better than X there|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: na drugim stole to samo - arcymistrzowski overbid|pg||
nt|petergill: Fiona not missing out on the extra 100, plus a heart lead (sdummy's first bid "suit might ensue from her Dbl|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Dhondy used Leaping Michaels (4@D) over the 3@C opener. Wrong time - 500|pg||
nt|petergill: which would be great if South had another heart|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|MolvaM: the computer dealt hands makes everyone paranoid a little bit after a while|pg||

nt|yusufb: zaten E bi aar @s der|pg||
nt|idc: I would have driven to game with the East hand - not that it will always make of course|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|kdr_fm: whats extrodinary is that 3NT is going to be real hard to beat|pg||
pc|hK|nt|bagman: AK and a low heart?|pg||

nt|james_h: not on this lead|pg||
nt|brolucius: All commentators are impartial, of course, but that only refers to their utterances on the screen. Some of them are cheering loudly at each swing in the right direction.|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|motu: everything is possible here:)|pg||
nt|athene: just the five obvious tricks to lose here|pg||
nt|petergill: Susan as expected leads a heart - dummy's first bid "suit", after the Dbl|pg||
nt|odysseus69: best to cash 2nd club -then d|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Pretty trick|pg||
nt|psridhar: 4s will make here with spd king in the box and cl q being stiff|pg||
pc|s3|nt|eweber: no miracle in the 4@h contract, but an imp for Russia anyway|pg||
nt|tomi2:  so 1 kexcard is missing and they stop in (a bad) game - I am no fan of this auction...|pg||
nt|chick: or a simple 2@H overcall|pg||
nt|justin c: hi james|pg||
nt|corplaw:  diamond to disrupt communications and set up ruff|pg||
nt|andreasw:  safe play|pg||
nt|sastro: kann nicht verstehen, dass man im anderen Raum etwas anderes als eine @H Topfigur ausspielz|pg||

pc|s7|nt|lmeili: at least it makes even guess wrong @s|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|h_karluk: just needs to play a trump|pg||
nt|h_karluk: say East played Ace and switched back to @c|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ruff with K|pg||
nt|athene: red ace-kings and a diamond ruff|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: no entrys in West to develope the @D |pg||
nt|h_karluk: well aren't we ready to play at least 3 level in any suit ? |pg||
nt|chick: EW potentially had 3N, so a disaster for NS is not a given|pg||
nt|lesh: a possible 800, South has to be careful|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: tam król kier sie utrzyma³|pg||
nt|aldek: problem jest nastepujacy, jak pas jest forsujacy to czy zaprasza do 5-ciu czy do 6-ciu|pg||

nt|8252: EO vont mener 4 0 mais ça va s'arreter là|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: ya east has too many entries|pg||
nt|bagman: The defense can take 2 clubs, a diamond and two trumps + a trick|pg||
nt|bagman: the trick can be either 3rd trump wiht a diamond overruff or a heart|pg||
nt|odysseus69: and now 3rd club|pg||
nt|bagman: Another safe play would have been one high trump from dummy and then hearts|pg||
nt|athene: i guess this will lose two hearts and one trick in each of the other suits, for one down|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|collins64: about the previous deal, you always have to discuss before is it or not GF 4@c overcall after weak 2@h opening|pg||
nt|MolvaM: now he can do his throw in|pg||
nt|jkotor: to mówi: "nie wiem czy ich X, czy graæ wy¿ej"|pg||
nt|jkotor: tak przynajmniej ja rozumiem pasa forsuj¹cego|pg||
pc|d2|nt|h_karluk: @h A  favorably placed|pg||
nt|MolvaM: which he didnt need actually :)|pg||
nt|james_h: hi boyz|pg||
nt|petergill: Fiona will (eventually, there's no rush) cash out|pg||
nt|motu: hallo zusammen|pg||
nt|riccho: hallo!|pg||
nt|j li: Hi|pg||
nt|sastro: moin Martin|pg||
pc|d8|pc|dA|nt|athene: no chance for the defence to get a trump promotion going and i don't see why declarer should take a backwards trump finesse|pg||
nt|xenya: S showed 5-4 in the minors, but clubs could longer than diamonds, so N had to guess -- hence his pass over 2@C|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|collins64: West had a very nice hand with 19HCP and East Pass with 2 Kings and a 7-card Q10 suit|pg||
nt|rnmalik: oops|pg||
nt|haans: we all see the clubs finesse|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Italy gained 10 when Russia played silly 4C contract here and 3NT next door|pg||
nt|ady: can be held to 8 |pg||
pc|s4|pc|s2|nt|andersk: wrong slam|pg||
nt|andersk: normal line|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 10 @C could come in play |pg||
pc|s9|nt|collins64: x Kxx Q10xxxxx KJ|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: if 4@c is not GF easts is reasonable however, he thinks the hand is a misfit, and his K@h can be a wasted value|pg||
nt|andersk: a lucky make|pg||
nt|andersk: since @H K is together with 3 card @S|pg||
nt|rnmalik: no on a @H finesse can make 7. @D lead would force him to take a finesse.|pg||
nt|andersk: I must be sleeping, 6 is alw cold|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: Sorry for the rush for the previous deql now we are align with the players|pg||
nt|rnmalik: ok and thanks.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but still may go down|pg||
nt|davidb: board  6  was classical  SPL   -suit preference lead -  high H for D |pg||
nt|ady: ooops     Patchman trying to protect possible entry and clear the hearts|pg||
nt|andreasw:  ok 9 trick's |pg||
nt|mdgraham: pity about the club ruff|pg||
nt|mdgraham: bit of a gift, that|pg||
nt|ady: sorry   9|pg||
nt|suketbombi: cud have made 10 here if he ducked the @H|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|motu: i do not see why E went beyond 3N since 2N shoed allready extras|pg||
nt|ziff:  Not easy to bid, as W may have 5 @D and @SA instead of KJ, making slam pretty good|pg||
nt|bagman: No trump promotion but the old fashioned tap|pg||
nt|bagman: Now a heart and ruff with 9 ?|pg||
nt|haans: best not is spades|pg||
nt|aldek: who should bid 4, east or west?|pg||
nt|rodvenn: not vulnerable you should, according to the law, always compete to the 3-level holding 8 against 8. They make, you go one down in the typical example|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Ivan needs subway tickets to enter the table and that doesn't help much|pg||
nt|petergill: the club ruffs were hard to find - EW will be happy with plus 200|pg||
nt|psridhar: the 4th dia in dummy will take care of declarer's cl loser|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ziff:  Hope springs eternal, as they say, but I agree that it was agressive|pg||
nt|athene: he is more likely to ruff with the queen surely|pg||
nt|MolvaM: but its good for discussions after the match with yr teammates: "I could have made it even if both @d honors were off"|pg||
nt|haans: Body in clubs very good|pg||
nt|rodvenn: of course you may feel that your hand has intermideate cards in their suit which makes you take another course|pg||
nt|petergill: @SA then @HA is what I would do|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But is X only for a @h lead? not in my opinion, so a @c lead is not so far away. But in nt - yes|pg||
pc|c7|nt|eweber: I don't count correcly, 4:1 is correct|pg||
nt|h_karluk: now trump promo possible|pg||
nt|bagman: what would you do then?|pg||
nt|cameron_1: i think they play the method 3m=non max lin linked M and 3M=max in other M|pg||
nt|mamos: I dont think West can    |pg||
nt|haans: endplay in hearts|pg||
nt|corplaw: can make 4 by playing a heart, but chooses to cross ruff for 3|pg||
pc|s6|nt|rnmalik: No @H finesse 6.|pg||
nt|andersk: East will get a trumph raise|pg||
nt|ftpe: will be poor result for ns i think|pg||
nt|bagman: Easts spade is too low to force the @SK|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|andersk: unfortunate for the sweeds|pg||
nt|h_karluk: the declarer should play a trump to K before touching @h|pg||
nt|cameron_1: so it was up to tom|pg||
nt|udo: hm,,,,was this the best line?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: PS, what is your first name among friends? :)|pg||
pc|d4|nt|rnmalik: tricky hand after very good lead of @D. we have seen all cards so easy for us.:)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3@S in E is key to its making without finesse also which is % wise low.|pg||
nt|andersk: Austrians|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ruff and do that - now or never|pg||
nt|haans: and a make???|pg||
nt|h_karluk: not really|pg||
nt|h_karluk: if pitches and plays a trump to table goes down to @c shift|pg||
nt|h_karluk: if ruffs and plays a trump to hand always makes, thinner than a hair line|pg||
nt|haans: best play was not to cover|pg||
nt|Walddk12: Good morning to Peter Crouch|pg||
nt|xenya: quite poor, yes|pg||
nt|xenya: 2@D is certainly better, although i'm not sure it makes |pg||
nt|lesh: 500 now, against 4@h it is a good result|pg||
nt|marlowepi: un spec astucieux note que 6P est faisable sur la donne precedente|pg||
nt|james_h: Terry is watchin the pips|pg||
nt|koksoy: 6  nolu..  boardda  rakip  4@S  e  gelmis  4-3  fite   bi  de  acaip  sekilde  yapmýs|pg||
pc|d3|nt|motu: with a decent hand and 5-5 W will make move over 3nt|pg||
nt|h_karluk: as we see all cards easy, i doubt same for him/her|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|andreasw:  :) *i could*|pg||
nt|lesh: here is nothing East can do to prevent South from taking 3more spade tricks|pg||
nt|odysseus69: sorry Lauria was declarer - also fine player|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
pc|d9|nt|ziff:  If 2N showed extras, yes|pg||
nt|mamos: same auction exactly in OR|pg||
nt|haans: well done|pg||
nt|james_h: hence taking the @sA|pg||
nt|james_h: Terry (W)|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: S will hope the @CA is with west now|pg||
nt|james_h: I dont think he has great expectations|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: well AQ9xx and ace is enough to double 2@d ... but he'll be disappointed|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|xenya: best he could do was play the @SQ|pg||
nt|bagman: Now declarer is quite badly placed. He'll probably ruffs a heart high|pg||
pc|dK|nt|h_karluk: that's off one|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: he is full off 10/9 cards fos Nt contract lovely deal |pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|h_karluk: fifty fifty, 3 tricks for EW also|pg||
pc|d5|nt|ftpe: well|pg||
nt|ftpe: ew migthy bid 4 he|pg||
nt|jkotor: @d was better than @h|pg||
pc|c8|nt|andersk: had to start with a small @D from dummy, to avoid truph promotion|pg||
pc|c3|nt|haans: kick them when they are down|pg||
nt|james_h: I dont think She has great expectstions (thanks kib)|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|xenya: 3 off now|pg||
nt|psridhar: Sridhar is what i am called; but PS is fine ( convenient)|pg||
mc|10|nt|bagman: Bocchi's trump big enough to score|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 2 down- maybe get Italy on scoreboard|pg||

nt|bagman: NS can make 4@H here, the 11th trick can come from the spade lead or spade guess|pg||
nt|brolucius: Gold found an 11-count that he was willing to pass. (Only a jack in the long suit, and four jacks in all.)|pg||
nt|bagman: Now he needs to describe the 'impossible' hand|pg||
nt|riccho: 3F sind immer schwer zu judgen|pg||
nt|motu: ich würde vermutlich passen|pg||
nt|j li: Ich bin auch ein Passant|pg||
mb|2N|nt|jameslee 2: East a take out 2@D on a dangerous 1Nt X|pg||
nt|lesh: probably E will bid 2@s or 2@h|pg||
nt|yusufb: 3@d|pg||
nt|corplaw: that is E-W bidding|pg||
nt|ady: n/s  have 3NT|pg||
nt|riccho: In einem NAT System wie Gro und Andreas es spielen, würde ich vermutlich auch passen. |pg||
nt|athene: simple 4@S looks possible, but he takes it slower|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulhac:  IF East had been the overcaller one could say that Spain were unlucky|pg||
nt|h_karluk: well, sorry i disagree that was unlucky|pg||
nt|roswolf: south will no doubt transfer and offer his pard a choice of games|pg||
nt|shevek: you can watch any match here :)  http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|andreasw:  thx mucht|pg||
nt|andreasw:  3@h slam invit?|pg||
nt|shevek: looks like it|pg||
nt|andreasw:  no best slam with @d AK out:)|pg||
nt|shevek: but 5@d is not a make|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 5d seems ok since defence cannot take their club ruff with a small trump|pg||
nt|rodvenn: Very good bridge to reach 5 @d in both rooms. |pg||
nt|james_h: 2@d XX being played at the other table|pg||
nt|james_h: NS|pg||
nt|eamongall: The Great Mulall managed 2@DXX a few months ago in the Regent up 3 ... Michael is not having the same success |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: another missfit in @S for N-S|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: shooting to 3NT |pg||
nt|brolucius: He may bid 3@S to show a sound raise to 4@H. No, 2NT does the job.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 2NT is a heart raise|pg||
nt|odysseus69: cant imagine them missing game|pg||
nt|bagman: Townsend has enought to bid/force to game|pg||
mb|3N|nt|xenya: or the score is wrong -- that happens from time to time|pg||
nt|lesh: but over 2@h West might blast to a game|pg||
nt|oleberg: The natural @D lead, will give the 9.th trick immidiately|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 3NT with a missfit is alays veryvery dificult |pg||
nt|oleberg: The natural heart lead is better :)|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 1 of the thing we try to teach bridge students is to go to game to 3NT with a fit in a minor |pg||
nt|mdgraham: and mine|pg||
nt|riccho: In precision würde ich auch passen, um nicht 2@c aufmachen zu müssen|pg||
mb|p|nt|chick: don't think a major suit game is possible|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: Buras wita sie z g¹sk¹ - poszli mu w kiera...|pg||
nt|hawe45:  OK - cÂ´est possible|pg||
nt|petergill: EW at the other table won the World Junior (U26) Pairs Championship in 2006 in Piestany, Slovakia, the only female pair ever to do so|pg||
nt|petergill: Cecilia Rimstedt was only 18 at the time, I think|pg||
nt|corplaw: bidding is off|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes must be|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: 2NT might have been alerted, otherwise I don't understand it|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 5@d good|pg||
nt|shevek: actually might make|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: second X pass out |pg||
nt|psridhar: this can be set 800|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: quite  a few down -3/-4 could be the result|pg||
nt|brolucius: If Madala had passed, some use 2NT by North to show a sound four-card heart raise and 2@S to show a sound three-card raise.|pg||
nt|bagman: 3NT might be makeable here|pg||
nt|suketbombi: nothing helps here not even the @S lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|wygbe1: probably lebensohl|pg||
nt|santyclz: The 6@h+1 ended as a push.  Neither n/s was able to overcome the preempt.|pg||
nt|star6ija: happens... :)|pg||
nt|shevek: yes|pg||
nt|haans: easier to play 2@D doubles not game sore if make|pg||
nt|psridhar: if defense can find the club ruff-they will get plenty of opportunities for the ruff|pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: Tam wyszli po raz drugi w Kiera. Alew chyba nie dadza rady wypuciæ|pg||
nt|8252: on devrait abdiquer, les @s ont souvent raison|pg||
nt|james_h: 19 imps|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: whoa 2200 ...|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: here after a major 2@S= very dificult to be in a correct contract |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: @S brake nicely |pg||
nt|riccho: Jetzt bekommt Andreas hier mit seiner Hand aber Frühlingsgefühle... |pg||
nt|idc: Watched some of that but it became too much after a while|pg||
pc|c4|nt|lesh: well looks like over 2@s as well :)|pg||
nt|chick: perhaps with a club finesse to dump a heart, this could make|pg||
nt|snetram:  3 kier forsowaÅo do koÅcÃ³wki, wiÄc pas zaprasza do szlemika|pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: Gdyby @CAs by³ u W, by³by przymus...|pg||
nt|idc: Pity npc cannot throw in the towel as in a boxing match|pg||
nt|psridhar: bd6 didnt fetch a danish gain as i expected|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ftpe: he will try ruff 2 di at hand|pg||
nt|lesh: the defence has to be careful|pg||
nt|babs59: Russia are in 6th place on 180 with France close behind on 178.  After that there's a bigger gap, Netherlands on 164...|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|eweber: in board 4 NL managed to win 4 by making 2@d, so 5:4 for them now|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Lebensohl or transfer Lebensohl. Transfer Lebensohl would show both monors|pg||
nt|peachy: even down 1, this be small gain for England|pg||
nt|peachy: and it could slip home|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Which is Jason and which is Justin?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ty|pg||
nt|chick: now very hard to make|pg||
nt|h_karluk: seems clubs hook needed|pg||
nt|snetram:  gdyby chciaÅ graÄ tylko 5 powinien sam licytowaÄ 5|pg||
nt|eamongall: and unfortunately in the not to distant future Eamon Galligans name will be mentioned in Ostend by the Ireland npc .... as I went for 2200 in Brighton as he whispered "donkey" ...|pg||
nt|eamongall: under his breath :):)|pg||
nt|j li: Gromöller hat einen Schlemmversuch gemacht, jetzt wird es schwierig, das Vollspiel zu erfüllen|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|haans: ERROR|pg||
nt|haans: no @C8|pg||
nt|h_karluk: operator, undo please|pg||
nt|haans: not|pg||
nt|mcarroll: All one way traffic at the moment|pg||
nt|haans: better :)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yep|pg||
nt|ady: 2 minor suit aces to lose|pg||
nt|shevek: can't score a ruff on top of AK|pg||
nt|lesh: he didnt has the entry ,however the small spade gave it|pg||
nt|h_karluk: then ruff hearts and try devil's coup|pg||
nt|petergill: At least 8 tricks for NS, even on a trump switch|pg||
nt|oleberg: Like Zia says: When you have the @D9, PLAY IT|pg||
nt|j li: Gut den Karoangriff vermieden!|pg||
pc|c5|nt|athene: the auction in the other room looks like an interesting twist on leaping michaels - you bid 4 of the minor you haven't got|pg||
nt|athene: that is perhaps sensible if you play the bids as forcing|pg||
nt|bagman: Thx all. I need to go now, see you again.|pg||
nt|bagman: bye|pg||
nt|santyclz: Thanks Pekka.|pg||
nt|athene: bye thanks|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: I think the irish fans need to start some serious prayers - its looking grim|pg||
nt|babs59: Netherlands, as host country, will have a place in the Bermuda Bowl field regardless|pg||
nt|bagman: If declarer guesses the clubs he has 9 tricks|pg||
pc|c6|nt|eweber: quite many warm up boards so far|pg||
nt|haans: @HK good play|pg||
nt|chick: really?|pg||
nt|babs59: Belgium is hosting the selection event, but I thought 2011 Bermuda Bowl etc slated for Netherlands?|pg||
nt|bagman: IF not, he might have time to establish the diamonds|pg||
nt|andreasw:  why board 8 here?|pg||
nt|bagman: If declarer loses a club trick to South, he returns a heart. West's spots are good enough to stop defense from taking 3 heart tricks|pg||
nt|andreasw:  he will take it with q and finesse clubs|pg||
nt|odysseus69: but gets there in the end|pg||
nt|athene: now his problem is how to hold his losers to two hearts and one spade|pg||
pc|c9|nt|collins64: @s to the J and it's over|pg||
nt|wygbe1: that lead may allow it to slip home|pg||
nt|andreasw:  so 11 trick's:)|pg||
nt|shevek: yes|pg||
nt|MolvaM: it seems the 5-5 minor gadget worked for the wales pair|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 3nt could well go down on spade lead|pg||
nt|udo: treffame wird wohl die Schlüsselkarte,,,und nach dieser reizung...|pg||
nt|riccho: Zumal wenn das 3er@s bei N bekannt wird|pg||
nt|udo: wennman allerdings bei Nord ein paar @h s und 3 Trümpfe erfährt.....|pg||
nt|idc: tricky - declarer would like to win this in dummy to take @h finesse|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: gdyby @C as by³ u W  moze by go ci¹gn¹³?|pg||

nt|jkotor: wczoraj widzielimy otwarcie Kality 1@s na "piêkne 10" i 5431|pg||
nt|james_h: Well, Ireland needed VPs badly and action was needed|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 9@D   a not bad play he will make 9 tricks |pg||
nt|oleberg: Yes, the defence has to play something|pg||
nt|odysseus69: hoping that defence will get stuck into diamonds or even spades|pg||
nt|babs59: has it changed?|pg||
nt|j li: Man wird die Gegnerhände auszählen können bis auf eine UF-Karte|pg||
pc|d4|nt|athene: it looks at first as though declarer might be able to hold his losers to two trumps from here, if he guesses right, but there's just too much work to do, i suppose|pg||
nt|lesh: well the declarer didnt want to take advantage|pg||
nt|chick: hehe|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Versace will not fall for this|pg||
pc|d5|nt|star6ija: 12 tricks may be taken now|pg||
nt|haans: @S7 count even|pg||
nt|bagman: This solves the spade guess as the the @DJ can be used to discard the spade|pg||
nt|bagman: His only option for 4 club trikcs is Kx N|pg||
nt|athene: @CA, @DAK throwing club, then duck a heart i suppose|pg||
pc|d8|nt|paulhac:  This looks like the only lead to give the contract|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Thanks Paul|pg||
nt|paulhac:  We think Justin is East|pg||
nt|haans: all cards from for Austria but no score i believe|pg||
nt|shevek: not if declarer ducks once?|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes he sould still go down|pg||
nt|andreasw:  would*|pg||
nt|justin c: only needs the @SK or the @DK right|pg||
nt|james_h: but the teams fate is sealed I fear|pg||
nt|oleberg: Leading towards the @DK can be done later|pg||
nt|udo: ist sie ( hoffentlich aus parteiischer Sicht) findbar:)|pg||
nt|j li: Der Gegner hat sie gefunden|pg||
nt|riccho: Ah... man will mit seinem Trumpfstich Schnapper machen... |pg||
nt|motu: das nachspiel hat geholfen|pg||
nt|j li: Jetzt muss Gro die Trümpfe finden|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: he can make 4@C+2@H+2@S= 8 tricks  |pg||
nt|ozgull: son üç bordun hepsi bize iyi|pg||
nt|j li: Einfacher Schnitt, oder Trumpfas, Trumpf nach?|pg||
nt|idc: but that uses up his only sure entry if he plans to try @s finesse later|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ryskiel_: i nast¹pi³o oddanie zapisu i strata|pg||
nt|odysseus69: wrong again- |pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's in the Netherlands alright, nothing has changed|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Top 6 + NL will qualify from all 3 categories|pg||
nt|andreasw:  well, only on entrance |pg||
nt|corplaw: think starting on clubs was better to create another entry to W's hand|pg||
nt|corplaw: now a heart return and spade back strands hand in dummy|pg||
nt|corplaw: or 10S return as well|pg||
nt|ady: Israel gained 2 imps on hand 5  going down 1 in 3@S|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ziff:  We can see that the contract is cold, but declarer can see only 8 tricks|pg||
nt|athene: ok, this is just doing his work for him|pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: Graja 3 Dzwonki|pg||
nt|bagman: Anyhow, the non-spade lead indicates the @SA|pg||
nt|barnets: low heart to the 8|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|brolucius: Good point.|pg||
nt|bagman: With trumps breaking the declarer has an easy claim|pg||
nt|bagman: West needs to win this|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: nothing else here i think, @s to the K and claim|pg||
nt|collins64: yes West need to lead A@h to beat the contract|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: there is nothing he can do if @s are 4-1|pg||
nt|lechcold: to wietnie:) nie doceni³em Grzegorza..bardzo siê cieszê bo 3@D chyba wygraj¹ bez problemu|pg||
nt|8252: N S peuvent scorer 140 la dessus, si on passe la bonne à @h, et à @c|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: K@D the 9 th trick|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: wd South|pg||
nt|athene: well finesse a heart|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jkotor: na oko odda pika i 2kara|pg||
nt|andreasw:  no Ace finesse clubs |pg||
nt|sastro: Plan ist klar- Ost soll auf Pik-Schnitt verzichten und N bekommt noch nen Schnapper wenn Partner @H -König hält|pg||
nt|riccho: hmm|pg||
pc|dA|nt|brolucius: Declarer would have had time to set up the clubs after a heart lead from West.|pg||
nt|tomi2:  for me it is quite impressive how many teams did not bid the grand in 6 till now|pg||
nt|bagman: Now the defense has 2 heart tricks ready|pg||
pc|d6|nt|tomi2:  bulgaria in 5@D, Norway in 6@D|pg||
nt|othered1: east doesn'thave the most comfortable of pitches|pg||
nt|jkotor: szczególnie po pikowym|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|lesh: going down now|pg||
nt|odysseus69: think hes home now unless defence finds spade switch|pg||
nt|riccho: @sK stellt sicher, dass der Gegner es richtig macht|pg||
nt|psridhar: with dia ace doubleton he will get another entry now|pg||
pc|h9|nt|boyklas: claim|pg||
nt|lmeili: pretty safe to win @hA if the lead from 4th, set up a @d trick as 9th |pg||
nt|xenya: 9 tricks now on a cross ruff|pg||
nt|chick: so a grosvenor duck by N sets this :)|pg||
nt|petergill: My job was to photograph the Swedish girls for the Bulletin after their win in Piestany. Cecilia said "Please wait until I make myself look better." I thought that was impossible. ...|pg||
nt|petergill: I will see if I can show find the photo for you|pg||
nt|odysseus69: no - defence still ok as long as not club|pg||
nt|barnets: a decs problem is the heart suit|pg||
pc|hT|nt|athene: spade force looked the natural play - perhaps Duboin was worried about forcing declarer too much and helping him into a trump coup against north's known heart length|pg||
nt|haans: Fallenius do not like it :(|pg||
nt|psridhar: Fredin must be ruing his decision to upgrade his hand to 1NT opening|pg||
nt|lechcold: -2 siê szykuje tutaj|pg||
pc|h7|nt|boyklas: i think its not reasonable to lead the AH|pg||
nt|collins64: for sure|pg||
nt|ftpe: solid play|pg||
nt|idc: a reasonable compromise - even if @d don't behave, they will provide some tricks and he keeps communications better|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: certainly not!|pg||
nt|haans: flat|pg||
nt|petergill: All four are in their (mid) twenties at this table. |pg||
nt|oleberg: I thought he might have played his heart|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: spec asked me if spain will play Argentine after quater-finals ???|pg||
nt|odysseus69: all over now|pg||
pc|dT|nt|tomi2:  San Marino should agree on their 2/1 follow ups too, 3@D was not a great score|pg||
nt|udo: jetzt schauts doch ganz gut aus:))|pg||
nt|psridhar: now he can make an overtrick on the major suit squeeze|pg||
pc|d7|nt|udo: 5 imps italy in board 5,,,NS bid on to 5 @S ,,against the probably making 5@C|pg||
nt|jkotor: przecina rêce ten As|pg||
pc|d9|nt|peachy: the end|pg||
nt|aldek: why didnot Townsend bid 3@S?|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: what do you all think?|pg||
nt|psridhar: well played|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|bagman: WIth his heart stopper declarer can afford to take a diamond finesse for overtrick now|pg||
nt|riccho: Überstich oder?|pg||
nt|barnets: while this wins with the actual distribution would lose to doubleton honour in west|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|ryskiel_: ach ten chciwy Bal|pg||

nt|ziff:  I am not surprised....|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: I see that on the rama but no idea on the subject|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: maybe on the slow playing|pg||
nt|tomi2:  yeaterday Nerherlands - Russia was scored as 18-2 VP because of 5 VP for each team|pg||
nt|lmeili: because of slow play?|pg||
nt|tomi2:  yes, as far as I know|pg||
nt|lmeili: that was a heavy penalty!|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: If I have good information they finish 20 minutes late in that match|pg||
nt|tomi2:  10 VP for 20 minutes? thats a lot|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: restarting here|pg||
nt|athene: which means duboin can't have had a count on the diamonds - if he knew declarer had four he would have bashed out that @S10 like a shot|pg||
nt|athene: the standard counter to a 2-suiter being to force declarer|pg||
nt|andreasw:  then a @d to ace and a @s back |pg||
nt|haans: yes dirty upscore|pg||
nt|psridhar: might hv worked on some other layout |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: yes 800 always dangerous|pg||
nt|lesh: here we go :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 5@c/@d ok|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: the @D was abit of desperation ... if left to her (i'm told) own devices declarer will have to gess is it @dKxx or @dKx|pg||
nt|cumino: May be board 6 is a bit delicate if EST opens 1S|pg||
nt|riccho: Gar nicht so einfach immer die brettharte defense zu finden... wie man hier sehen kann|pg||
nt|psridhar: the NS here sem to play a simple std system, but the OPEN denmark tean that i played against twice play very complicated system|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You are correct|pg||
nt|idc: I see Poland are doing well - 23-7 at the momkent so have closed the gap to Italy to just 7 VPs|pg||
nt|psridhar: abnormally complex but youngsters remember everything|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and France doing well too and have closed the gap to Denmark for 3rd|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Still two matches after this, much can happen|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In the next round all our matches are from the open series|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Italy v Israel and Poland v Germany are crucial|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: israel made 3nt on bd 4 for another game swing|pg||
nt|ady: partial here in spades   Ireland need to keep low|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes may well get too high|pg||
nt|psridhar: Fredin will briefly consider 3nt b4 bidding 4s when he finds out his pd has unbal hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: There was no follow-up to discuss. North jumped to 3@D, South thought it was a WJS and passed|pg||
nt|cumino: 1NT|pg||
nt|barnets: imagine east had QJxx in hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: apparently the rooms are connected now|pg||
nt|Gerben42: white vs red NS are very agressive, but as we have seen vuln. they are middle of the road|pg||
nt|eweber: 3@s is not exactly what you'd dream of with the South hand...|pg||
nt|Gerben42: best to not dream but pass with a happy face|pg||
nt|eweber: I assume West is the one who is taking his time here|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Great to see the Irish at the top of the leader board|pg||
nt|josj: as far as I know, they were about 30 mins. late and were eventually fined 3 VP each|pg||

nt|shevek: south can only get in once (@dK)|pg||
nt|ftpe: that opening will probably bring them to 6 spades|pg||
nt|xenya: on 7, the Estonian EW in the other room got to 4@H -- not a bad contract really, but down on foul trump split -- 1 down and 7 imps to Russia|pg||
nt|ftpe: in 6 spades he has to guess spade queen, but best chance is playing on sp 2-2|pg||
nt|haans: 10-13|pg||
nt|lechcold: 54 impy w 8 rozdaniach|pg||
mb|1C|nt|mcarroll: Unfortunate lie of the cards, but will be the same in the other room  one assumes|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hmmm?|pg||
nt|athene: my guess is they put the board on the table upside down|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hand reversed?|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: ty vugragher |pg||
nt|oleberg: Well, if you play Ghana in football, I guess a black squeeze is possible|pg||
nt|barnets: then dec still had a loser|pg||
nt|jkotor: 5@c made board 4 after K@h lead|pg||
mb|1S|nt|boyklas: FG raise with D?|pg||
nt|boyklas: or 14+ Bal?|pg||
nt|haans: that 1@S overcall???|pg||
nt|xenya: i don't think 6@S is such a great contract -- problems in spades and diamonds|pg||
nt|ftpe: agree, but they will get there after ligth open, |pg||
nt|xenya: well the 3@H bid makes it easier to solve the spade problem|pg||
nt|haans: Fredit pass??????|pg||
nt|udo: Ed,Tomi,Roland,,thks so far,,,have to leave for work:)  would like to stay here..|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thanks Udo|pg||
nt|mdgraham: quite a rate of exchanges - 56 imps in 7 boards|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 3nt  by NS likely to fail as nothing works for the 9th trick however 5@C is a great contract and aMake|pg||
nt|suketbombi: @@@S pd bid on if @H is ur suit|pg||
nt|ady: 2@D  multi     2@S   shows good heart support   but sign of for spades|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 2@S|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Might make 3Nt by ducking @s and organizing endplay of West|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes|pg||
nt|riccho: O verkauft seine Hand notgedrungen als BAL |pg||
mb|d|nt|ftpe: after 3 he better chance to play north for Qxx in sp|pg||
nt|haans: ERROR|pg||
nt|brolucius: Work? What is that?|pg||
nt|tomi2:  then they should discuss their first round of bidding as well :)|pg||
nt|justin c: @D losers were going on the @HKQ|pg||
nt|odysseus69: where 3NT was 3 down here it was 4 down in Open Room despite 6 tricks on top|pg||
mb|p|nt|collins64: 2NT is GF with @d|pg||
nt|collins64: GF with 4+ @d|pg||
nt|boyklas: 6D makes here|pg||
nt|collins64: 3NT 12-14 balance|pg||
nt|boyklas: with the AH in his place|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: difficult decision for South here|pg||
nt|andersk: 3 NT?|pg||
nt|peachy: operator doing great job, keeping up with the fairly fast pace at the table|pg||
nt|pitiful:  4@h not timid|pg||
nt|xenya: yes|pg||
nt|udo: i will send u an E-Mail, david|pg||
nt|brolucius: Thx.|pg||
nt|lesh: what might appeared to be a sacrifice for N/S it will be a makable game :)|pg||
nt|chick: 3@D is enough|pg||
nt|lesh: they need to find @c support|pg||
nt|lesh: 1@d has to be alerted I think|pg||
nt|lesh: they play prec :)|pg||
nt|ady: south might compete with 3@C    but not clear action|pg||
nt|Walddk12: Kokish?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Starting in 1½ hours|pg||
mb|2C|nt|rigas_karo: it is safe to bid once again but |pg||
nt|rnmalik: very tempting:)|pg||
nt|mamos: good pressure from South|pg||
nt|othered1: Bye, Udo.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i choose 3@h cue here|pg||
nt|chick: right, 3@C is a better bid|pg||
nt|lechcold: basketball|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: ahh true|pg||
mb|2S|nt|collins64: if Mike bid 4@d, Isabelle 4@h they'll play 6@d|pg||
nt|eweber: if anyone of the players|pg||
nt|yuval10: not everyone's X perhaps|pg||
nt|ady: this might cause Irland to get too high|pg||
nt|jkotor: jak w dobrych juniorskich czasach :)|pg||
nt|koksoy: 5@D  veya  4@H  iyi  kontratlar  bizim  4@S  de  iyi  baraj...  5@D  oynayacaklar  sanýrým|pg||
nt|suketbombi: even @H in isolation will allow to make if the 1st @S is ducked|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Icelnad bid 3Nt on bd 7|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 3@D is Rubinsol trf to @Hs i Suppose|pg||
nt|odysseus69: surprising|pg||
mb|p|nt|rigas_karo: 4@d or 4NT?|pg||
nt|roswolf: the boards have been swingy - Italy - slovakia 46-0 after 4 boards shows how|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Vul, not for the fainthearted!|pg||
nt|mamos: at least a couple off|pg||
nt|cameron_1: but flat vs. 3@s so|pg||
nt|cameron_1: flatish|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes but N takes the firsst @D trick|pg||
nt|MolvaM: good stop|pg||
nt|andreasw:  first|pg||
nt|xenya: no slam now -- just collecting your money i think...|pg||
nt|lechcold: 2BA naci¹gane|pg||
nt|james_h: Penos in South Africa ...|pg||
nt|oleberg: 2@H = 3 spades and a good raise. Normally not a gameforcing hand|pg||
nt|funtay: 6. brd 13 bize:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|andersk: opps|pg||
nt|andersk: cold 4 @H|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 4@H +1|pg||
nt|athene: not sure i like unusual 2nt with 6@D4@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: :)|pg||
nt|athene: partner usually bids clubs with equal length which isn't at all what you want|pg||
nt|athene: notice how south can't bid stayman intending 2@S (sign-off) over 2@D|pg||
nt|athene: they obviously play that as something cunning|pg||
nt|athene: we have seen they have lots of relay auctions after stayman so you do lose the ability to bid it on rubbish hands|pg||
nt|shevek: 8 declarer made 3N and 8 went down|pg||
nt|shevek: declarers|pg||
nt|MolvaM: so it must have been a 50% contract :)|pg||
nt|shevek: true, needs accurate defence|pg||
nt|shevek: lol  murat|pg||
nt|xenya: or... who knows?|pg||
nt|lesh: he has to guess Q@d now, but it is difficult and probably -2|pg||
nt|hawe45:  300 avec le bon flanc - mais tout normale|pg||
nt|mdgraham: understandable auction, but the cards do not lie well|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: Ole I would love to play Ghana tat would mean we are in the final :)|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 2@H = is new for me nice |pg||
nt|oleberg: "To play Ghana" sounds like something that could be illegal (or prohibited to minors)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: coffee time|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A very sound contract on this lie|pg||
nt|mdgraham: heavy 1NT overcall, but you don't really want to pass at this vulnerability|pg||
nt|yusufb: 6 bordda 53 imp baya fazla|pg||
nt|ozgull: eller ona uygun tüm maçlar imp kaynýyor|pg||
nt|corplaw: easy 3N|pg||
nt|skaftij:  likely 10 imps to Iceland|pg||
nt|Walddk12: Glaub ich schon|pg||
nt|j li: 2@H zeigt 19-20 ausgeglichen|pg||
nt|athene: no @S switch?|pg||
nt|jkotor: @d|pg||
mb|p|nt|pitiful:  some play middle encourages and high or low sp in this situation|pg||
nt|shevek: to be fair some went down in 6@d :)|pg||
nt|petergill: Found it http://www.worldbridge1.org/bulletin/06_2%20Piestany/pdf/pairs/bul_04.pdf there are 2 photos of Cecilia. Interesting that the Poles who ran 2nd to them in the 2006 World ...|pg||
nt|petergill: Junior Pairs are near the top of the datums in the Open here in Ostend|pg||
nt|ralfwil: was N opening 1@h? 5+ |pg||
nt|skaftij:  Haraldsson opened 15-17 NT in 4th seat on his good 14 count|pg||
pc|c7|nt|collins64: he made the wrong choice|pg||
nt|boyklas: all the problems comes here for S because he doesnt know the H or the C Quebid|pg||
nt|boyklas: and he make go down even a 5D|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: at least the did well to avoid 6NT :)|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: 5@d by North is safe|pg||
nt|collins64: Belgium is back after the previous deal|pg||
nt|collins64: Dehaye weak NT forced them to play 4@h for one down|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: very weak NT :)|pg||
nt|boyklas: Manolis choosed to play at the 5-3 fit and not at the 4-4, firstly was thinking that he is playing at th 5-4 fit|pg||
nt|collins64: the bidding was 1NT 8-11 Pass 3@c X and he bid 4@h with his 5-card Q@h and his 4-card 8@s|pg||
nt|ady: they might make this  getting 3 diamond tricks|pg||
nt|lesh: A@s and @d switch|pg||
nt|h_karluk: straightforward play also possible|pg||
nt|chick: against the odds to drop the @DQ, but W may lead trump now to protect against a spade ruff|pg||
nt|barnets: Hacketts stopped in 4@S|pg||
nt|bagman: The hands do not fit well|pg||
nt|barnets: after a couple of slam tries|pg||
nt|barnets: on board 6|pg||
nt|brolucius: Countries in certain parts of the globe get a 'free pass' into the Bermuda Bowl. It is much more difficult if you are a European country.|pg||
nt|barnets: Holland have afree pass|pg||
nt|barnets: being the host country|pg||
nt|barnets: next year|pg||
nt|cumino: Good lead here K@H|pg||
nt|udo: und 3 @S zeigt 5er@S 4er@h ?|pg||
nt|j li: Das gibt die Konventionskarte nicht her|pg||
nt|athene: 2@C is clubs or a good hand|pg||
nt|barnets: sementa surprisingly switched @D|pg||
nt|tokay1975: 2h is minus8 points |pg||
pc|cT|nt|dburn: perhaps he should have signalled for a heart|pg||
nt|aldek: and now @DQ|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer is afraid to duck|pg||
nt|yusufb: pas yada 5@d|pg||
nt|koksoy: 6  nolu  boardda  Kuranoglu  4@S  i  gercekten  sýk  oynamýs|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes|pg||
nt|athene: 2@H is 5-7 points|pg||
nt|jkotor: always making|pg||
pc|cA|nt|collins64: did he actually play the K@h|pg||
nt|boyklas: i dont think so.|pg||
nt|andersk: probably @H 9 lead|pg||
nt|rnmalik: suit worth bidding is worth leading.:)|pg||
nt|haans: most would say "thats not fair"|pg||
nt|davidb: should make on the  D suit |pg||
nt|athene: if north has a pretty good penalty pass here unless he thinks the double is really really offensive|pg||
nt|santyclz: The "DNPA" (does not promise anything) stayman has a lot going for it, but gives up a lot on big hands.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Entame atout - et bonne chance...|pg||
nt|haans: @H to ace to avoid @S ruff|pg||
nt|jkotor: nasi tu 1ba graj¹|pg||
nt|lechcold: 3BA te¿ naci¹gane:) i rezultat bêdzie chyba adekwatny|pg||
nt|bagman: the lead might have been from Kx|pg||
nt|corplaw: looks like will make 5 on favorable lie of other suits|pg||
nt|j li: 3@s ist 54 inOF und gf , dank an den kiebitz|pg||
nt|udo: hab Bestätigung vom Chef,,zeigt 5-4|pg||
nt|sastro: 6 sind möglich - ausser bei @S angriff|pg||
nt|motu: 6@H würde ohne @S aqusspiel vermutlich gehen|pg||
nt|j li: Falls Andreas Richtung Schlemm marschiert, muss Süd Pik ausspielen|pg||
nt|udo: nahezu unmögliches Ausspiel|pg||
nt|odysseus69: West played a high heart signalling for a spade but East switched to Diamond|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: strange|pg||
nt|andersk: should make now|pg||
nt|paulhac:  And the other room is 2 boards ahead|pg||
nt|andersk: the famous "almost 1k"  +990|pg||
nt|roswolf: i am told gib says the game can make -in practice i am confident it wont|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Sorry - trump lead - and good luck, I meant|pg||
nt|star6ija: 8+points, 5+@hs|pg||
nt|chick: OR, E could make a brilliant overtake of the spades and lead a trump :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: if ther declarer decided to play straightforward that doesn't make a sense|pg||
nt|chick: unfortunately, that gives away the location of the @DQ, so S might just try for the drop now|pg||
nt|h_karluk: *the|pg||
pc|dK|nt|peachy: so even faster there|pg||
nt|ady: problem is the tap with the clubs|pg||
nt|star6ija: :)|pg||
nt|haans: claiming time|pg||
nt|lesh: well East is forced to switch to @d, having or no @d|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: I assumed opener had at least the Q for the 2@h opener - sry :>|pg||
nt|james_h: NS play control responces to 1@c?|pg||
nt|barnets: duboin could have ovetaken the @HK and played @Sk butthat carried some risk|pg||
pc|d8|nt|mcarroll: Although playing safe after the double 4 is the probable outcome|pg||
nt|psridhar: actually 3nt is superior cont-4s may fail if h ace was wrong|pg||
nt|othered1: Lauria and Versace seem not to have adopted the modern support double.|pg||
nt|snetram:  zauwazcie Å¼e jeszcze dwa rozdanie wcale nie musiaÅy byÄ remisowe. Wtedy by byÅo 80 IMP|pg||
nt|lechcold: du¿a czêæ graczy stosuj¹cych naturalne systemy panicznie boi siê otwierania 1@C/@D na 19PC i masowo naci¹gaj¹ takie rêce do  otwarcia 2BA|pg||
nt|aldek: jak sie trefle nie sa 4-0 a impas pik idzie to duza szansa wygrania|pg||
nt|hawe45:  4 de @S|pg||
nt|8252: moins 1 ou moins 2 suivant les nerfs de Fred à @c|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 9/10 can be made|pg||
nt|odysseus69: surprising to win|pg||
nt|udo: ich glaube aber auch nciht an Schlemmreizung|pg||
pc|d2|nt|rnmalik: Possibility only if declarer guesses the entry to W hand.|pg||
nt|athene: Mari shamefacedly trying to shift some diamonds in with his clubs, courtesy of a black pen|pg||
nt|brolucius: Speculative double from East.|pg||
nt|othered1: Their doubles show extras, I believe.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They prefer to use double for something else. One can survive without support doubles you know|pg||
nt|tomi2:  eas has @CAQ in their opened suit, @DA, @SQ and partner made a constructive call vulnerable|pg||
nt|brolucius: Kibitzers suggest lead-directing double (similar to Lightner). But not obvious to me, nor to West.|pg||
nt|lesh: Q@D :)|pg||
nt|james_h: tes they are, confirmed|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Roland like all english men has becomes a master of understatement|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This trick is VERY important, North|pg||
nt|othered1: I survive very well without them in almost all partnerships that don't have hours to discuss their ramifications.|pg||
nt|jkotor: 80 to ju¿ blisko mojego juniorskiego rekordu 88-1 w 8 rozd|pg||
nt|justin c: this looks like a good moment to get a drink|pg||
nt|brolucius: In Beijing there were 13 European quarter-finalists out of 16 (in the Open and Women's events) but Europe is given only one quarter of the world championship slots for the Bermuda ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: Bowl and Venice Cup.|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer can make with high cross ruff, if the defense takes the heart ruff|pg||
nt|barnets: that is why the european championships are one of the toughest tests in the whole of bridge|pg||
nt|bagman: Gold thinking how to beat this. There is, however, no way to beat|pg||
nt|odysseus69: and if they dont?|pg||
nt|cumino: 1 more if they don't|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer can discard a heart on the @CA to make 11 tricks with a cross ruff|pg||
nt|koksoy: kozlarýn  durumu  kötü  3pik 1karo 1kör  verse  300  oluyor  iyi  skor|pg||
nt|koksoy: ben  1  yazýyorum  seyirciler 8 yazýyor..  tesekkürler  herkese  cevap  vermeye  hýzým  yetmiyor...|pg||
nt|koksoy: elimden  geldigince  cevap  vermeye  calýsýyorum|pg||
nt|psridhar: Caviezel guessed well to pass 2s rebid here-but imagine that W hand without those 2 queens but the spd ace instead|pg||
pc|d5|nt|yuval10: nice guess by declarer|pg||
nt|davidb: D to the 9 = 10 tricks|pg||
nt|aldek: reka N to jest oczywiste otwarcie 2BA|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 800 theoriquement disponible sur entame trefle|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Petit Chr.|pg||
nt|8252: fo pas exagérer, le 8 de @s stoppe l'hemoragie|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 2nd tie break for Murray|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer was quite safe when he did not discard a heart on @CA in the early play, If he would have misguessed diamonds, the 2nd trump back woul d have leaft him a trick short|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|xenya: down 4 if W just cashes his high cards now|pg||
nt|ftpe: wow, 3 he in open room :)|pg||
nt|xenya: he will have to do it sooner or later |pg||
nt|ftpe: + 50 not much when close to 1430|pg||
nt|xenya: well E didn't open there, and that made all the difference |pg||
nt|psridhar: not after the X of course|pg||
nt|haans: yep 3nt a make|pg||
pc|dA|nt|hawe45:  Ouf|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: i do tego jeszcze czerwoni le¿¹ dobrze|pg||
nt|jkotor: zagra chyba Q@s|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 9 after the @S finesse |pg||
nt|bagman: Now 100% for 11 tricks when the diamonds break|pg||
nt|suketbombi: !A and small from both hhands|pg||
nt|skaftij:  now duck@h|pg||
nt|udo: ein Sieg wäre schon wichtig für die Nationalmannschaft,|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|ady: I think can be made playing a diamond to the 9 after Q@S|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes intra finesse position|pg||
nt|pitiful:  still a nice pick up for n-s|pg||
nt|pitiful:  even without the double|pg||
nt|marlowepi: trois fois trefles, as de pique, carreau et pique, un trefle aussi eventuellement au flanc|pg||
nt|bagman: the only way to discard would have been by crossing with a trump|pg||
nt|Walddk2: PS was right about board 7. Game bid in the open room, 10 IMPs to Denmark|pg||
pc|c2|nt|koksoy: peki  teslim  oldum  11  tane  -1   olur  geldi  :)|pg||
nt|yusufb: tabii gorunuþte 2@s 1@h 1@d gozukyo|pg||
nt|yusufb: oledegil tabii|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|athene: still 800|pg||
nt|ftpe: rigth|pg||
nt|xenya: of course, you could argue that EW might have got in later in the auction, but it's easier to say...|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 10@H or 9@H|pg||
nt|udo: die ersten 10 dieser EM haben die Berechtigung am ChampionsCUP der Landesmeister telzunehmen|pg||
nt|riccho: Die 10. ersten Plätze qualifizieren zum Champions Cup|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|hawe45:  But less than 500 will be difficult|pg||
nt|riccho: D ist 11.|pg||
nt|tokay1975: alfredo may bid  with a  better 18 count but not with this one |pg||
nt|athene: obviously it was less risky than leaving his pd on lead :)|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|xenya: by the way, i think the E hand is an opener|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Le retour du 9 de @H Ã¡ la place du Valet aura ete mieux|pg||
nt|yusufb: kalýta caktýrýnca @s ten 3alýyor|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mcarroll: Back to +1 after no trump shift|pg||
nt|haans: do not like this |pg||
nt|h_karluk: push next board please|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: coup de grace 9@D|pg||
pc|h3|nt|Walddk2: Be careful Ed, David may have to look that word up too|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer has three minor-suit stoppers to knock out.|pg||
nt|jkotor: czy nie lepiej teraz z pozycji Adama 10?|pg||
nt|udo: die ersten 6 bei der Bermuda BOwl,,dafür bräuchte es aber fast ein Wunder|pg||
nt|idc: No weak two there, so they had a free run|pg||
pc|h5|nt|rnmalik: In the OR K@D was led.|pg||

nt|petergill: We put some info about the Swedes on page 2 of this Bulletin two days later http://www.worldbridge1.org/bulletin/06_2%20Piestany/pdf/camp/bul_02.pdf|pg||
nt|bagman: now he needs to add up his tricks and claim|pg||
pc|h6|nt|jameslee 2: cover to finesse 10@S|pg||

nt|j li: Mit 12 Siegpunkten Rückstand auf den 10.|pg||
pc|h8|nt|athene: even the "cash all my aces, one by one" defence will be just fine|pg||
nt|brolucius: Can some knowledgeable person put up the web-site address for the current scores?|pg||
nt|udo: aber Top 10 ist mit ordentlichen Restergebnissen noch in Reichweite|pg||
pc|hA|nt|aldek: 20 moze byc nawet bardzo brzydkie|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: mówisz Lechu - moze mieæ 16 lat byle mlodo wygl¹da³a:)|pg||
nt|oleberg: Nice technique by Bjarnarson, for an extra trick|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: @S = trup out & start again with @H finessse again 9@H|pg||
nt|skaftij:  often overseen play that putting up 10 is a no gain play|pg||
nt|suketbombi: std % play when u have this combination in 7 cards wins when 3/3 or doubleton H when 4/2|pg||
nt|ady: e/w cant get to their spade trick   so 170 |pg||
pc|h7|pg||

nt|roswolf: all hinges on the @D suit|pg||
nt|ady: end play west|pg||
nt|ady: only 9 tricks|pg||
nt|davidb: H to K & D to the 9 -normal play|pg||
nt|ady: diamond to the ace and diamond to 9|pg||
nt|bagman: Madala's playing safe for 10 tricks; he should have cashed the @DK as South ruffing it and trump back was practically impossible|pg||
nt|rodvenn: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/runningscores/asp/roundteamsconditstatclassicmod.asp?qtournid=821&qshowflag=1|pg||

nt|pitiful:  not many would not want to show that @h suit|pg||
nt|xenya: but pass by S looks clear now|pg||
nt|brolucius: Attitude leads against NT, so the low club shows a suit that will be worth pursuing.|pg||
nt|othered1: would south have taken the same line without the double, which pretty strongly put the @CQ offside?.|pg||
nt|lesh: @c switch is not that difficult|pg||
nt|lesh: or playing small :)|pg||
nt|justin c: several of them, truth to tell|pg||

nt|Walddk2: grey-ish rather|pg||

nt|petergill: so 1NT rebid 15-17 and 2@D GF checkback with 2@H = three hearts|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East getting the character of her hand across with 1NT. Not much of a diamond stop, but anything else would be a distortion  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: painted them, perhaps?|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer has 9 top tricks in high cards and all suits stopped. He should play diamonds for 5 tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: It's particularly unsafe to balance when the opponents haven't shown a fit.|pg||

nt|barnets: anyone living in usa should write and comlain to espn|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|Walddk12: It wasn't for the Italians after the same start. Bocchi bid 4@H, 5@D by Madala and 6@H|pg||
nt|barnets: a diamond ?|pg||
nt|cumino: Diamond beats |pg||
nt|bagman: Madala's going to lead a spade and Bocchi's going to play the @SQ|pg||
nt|koksoy: burada  @H  overcallundan  sonra   dbl=  en az  4 tane  pik  demek....  1S  deseydi  =  cevap  verecek  kadar puan va ancak  4lü  pik  yok  demekti|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|boyklas: if he had not take the D he would have made it|pg||

nt|odysseus69: need to know what they said about 3S bid|pg||
nt|barnets: wow amazing|pg||
nt|bagman: well done by Madala|pg||
nt|brolucius: Too good.|pg||
nt|bagman: Might 3@S mean solid spade stopper and not so solid diamond stopper?|pg||

nt|babs59: East is relieved to get the spade trick, bonus|pg||
nt|odysseus69: yes xx on this - pass not allowed |pg||
nt|idc: Poland up to a maximum 25 VPs now, so gap at the top between them & Italy only 2 VPs|pg||
pc|cT|nt|haans: sloppy|pg||
nt|tomi2:  maybe he can make versace believe @CQ is onside and use spade as entry to hand|pg||
nt|tomi2:  but versace had @CT8, so he could have played the clubs starting with the 8 then without losing communication|pg||
nt|brolucius: Worth another look, you are right. Easier on Deep Finesse.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If S had followed with @hQ on @hK.....|pg||

nt|odysseus69: Pekka I thnk you called it right|pg||
nt|barnets: actually that was live but the tennis is not|pg||
nt|psridhar: Italy is yet to get off the schenider even after half the match, admittedly the danish competition has been fierce|pg||
pc|s2|nt|roswolf: a huge swing on bd6 to ireland when the israelis lost 800 in 5@CX|pg||
nt|ady: board 6 Ireland gain 14 imps    when Israel went down in 4 spades with 2 heart ruffs    the Israel South came in at the 5 level with clubs when Ireland reached 4 spades|pg||

nt|james_h: its about an 80% contract|pg||
pc|cA|nt|lmeili: 3N sounds a good contract, needs @d K on side |pg||
nt|bagman: he might try a heart to the 7 for 8th trick|pg||
pc|c9|nt|boyklas: why not claim?|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: ohh noo nm|pg||
nt|james_h: when clubs 4-1 off side, you can finesse the @h 10|pg||
nt|eamongall: 12 tricks yeah |pg||
pc|c5|nt|rigas_karo: it turned out to be a decision to pass with north's hand|pg||

nt|petergill: @D2 = "reverse suit preference"|pg||
nt|petergill: West cannot get East in|pg||
nt|petergill: North's jamming 4@H call was a good bid, convincing EW not to try 4@S|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed, especially since 4@s would actually make on a heart lead|pg||
nt|petergill: With NS playing a limited opening system (11H 11-16), 4@H might also have been bid on a balanced 14 count, making 4@S by East quite dangerous|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@H 11-16|pg||

nt|dburn: so this is not an easy problem for Rimstedt - although whatever she does will work|pg||

pc|c8|pg||
nt|rnmalik: The contract I mean.|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: that's what I got from thr CR|pg||
nt|athene: if east suspects the 1@H is a psyche he can't be so sure about the diamond finesse|pg||
nt|shevek: I would pass every time|pg||
nt|brolucius: One heart loser goes on the @CA, so slam depends on picking up the trump. But no reason to think they will bid it.|pg||
nt|snetram:  trefl do waleta i 9 lew|pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: Oraz Nefki...|pg||
nt|james_h: I;m Herr James H from Austria, check my flag |pg||

nt|haans: i think he did not have a clue were @SJ was :)|pg||

nt|jameslee 2: 4@C= 10 tricks |pg||
nt|j li: egal, da Kirmse zwei Asse hat|pg||
nt|idc: But I think the West hand is just too weak, and the singleton @d is a turn off|pg||
nt|Walddk2: On board 9 where Cedolin played well to make his 2@S, Magnussen in the other room made an overtrick|pg||
pc|hK|nt|pitiful:  still if he did he would probably be on lead to 4@s anyway|pg||

nt|oleberg: South might have opened too, on board 10|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: @H brake 3/3 will help him to get home|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @sA onside and @h not worse than 4-2 is enough|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: true clubs 2/2 helps but with clubs 3/1 also gets there with a @H play first|pg||
nt|idc: Even if North leads a low @h, with the West hand entryless and @h blocked, I'm not sre 3NT makes|pg||

nt|kdr_fm: looks like this will just get home declarer heart pips are just too good and S cant force E|pg||
nt|suketbombi: there is not much hope here for declerer|pg||
pc|dA|nt|hawe45:  Carefully played to discard a @H|pg||
nt|cameron_1: are you sure?|pg||
nt|mamos: South holding @HK makes it morelikely that North has @sK   but still needs to finesse 10|pg||
nt|othered1: But NS will  have an exact description of west hand and west will be declarer so @H lead very likely from both sides.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Well done to bid it!|pg||
nt|tomi2:  lauria will lead @HK with his likely trump trick|pg||
nt|bagman: In every case E has quite a minimum|pg||
nt|bagman: North might be wondering if the weakness is compensated by singleton spade|pg||
nt|ady: israel down 2 in 4@H   hand 9     first spade was ducked|pg||
pc|d5|nt|pitiful:  that was just to see how many messages I would get :)|pg||
nt|pitiful:  quite a few|pg||
nt|pitiful:  ...|pg||
nt|mamos: i think you should stick to Bridge Peter|pg||
nt|pitiful:  and no I do not play for Spurs|pg||
nt|pitiful:  perhaps I need to put that in my profile|pg||
nt|dburn: his problem is that he thinks (from the opening bid) that North has the ace of clubs|pg||
nt|pitiful:  this is very tough for TT|pg||
nt|pitiful:  DG sorry|pg||
nt|dburn: in which case he needs to cater for the possibility that North will play the fourth round of diamonds|pg||
nt|dburn: so perhaps he will cash hearts, hoping to pitch West's remaining diamond|pg||
nt|dburn: of course, if he had played a low heart to the queen instead of running the jack, as he probably should have done, he would have a quick entry to dummy now|pg||
nt|ftpe: yes|pg||

nt|andreasw:  i would pass|pg||
nt|shevek: as I said, I would pass in all positions  lol|pg||
nt|andreasw:  :)|pg||
nt|tomi2:  @C lead would be fatal, but I can't imagine this|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so Jivko, just curiosity, you didn't consider 1N overcall by W?|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: Ice|pg||
nt|oleberg: South undeled his diamonds in case declarer had the @SJ|pg||
nt|oleberg: Then a low spade would have given declarer a guess|pg||
nt|psridhar: defense in 3nt will score at least the same tricks as they do in 3d|pg||
nt|psridhar: and many more if they find the spd lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The Danes also avoided the diamond slam on 10. The auction was short and sweet. 1@D  2@C  ;  3NT|pg||
nt|idc: Ok, we have set up an experiment - I'm told the OR is in 3NT so we will see how it goes :)|pg||
mc|8|nt|jameslee 2: 8 more for Israel so score 11/2|pg||
nt|psridhar: that dia 3 by Fredin in the 3rd round of dia=sps for h ( 2 for cl and 4 for spd)- obediently Fallenius shifts to H for d2 wd|pg||
nt|tomi2:  west will take his time to think of the best play in trumps|pg||

mb|d|nt|rnmalik: 3NT for Ns.|pg||
nt|tomi2:  in the OR Piekared prefered a double here to 2NT|pg||
nt|tomi2:  ending up as dummy in 2@D, not the contract he was dreaming of|pg||
nt|athene: i am not sure where they went wrong but clearly a wheel came off somewhere|pg||
nt|pitiful:  another lead directing bid|pg||
nt|dburn: I suspect the play went quickly at the end - some of those cards were doubltess not played to the same trick|pg||

nt|8252: mais il vaut mieux soit qua ça marche, soit avoir des partenaires compréhensifs et doux|pg||
nt|odysseus69: wrong colours for 5C|pg||
mb|p|nt|andersk: Est overcalled 1 @S in open room, and South 2 @S, quite strange bidding, anyway NOrway playing 5 NT in open room|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Looks like 4@H should make|pg||

nt|petergill: Bd 11: At the other table, South opened 1NT, West bid 2@C single suiter  and EW never found out what suit it was, so NS ended up in 4@H|pg||

nt|andersk: offside|pg||
nt|andersk: incredible match on TV too:)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 6@d may have communication problems.... between parters :)|pg||
nt|lesh: probably 1nt was 3 suits and that's why North decided to pass over 3@d|pg||
nt|lesh: and possible 5@c bid by West now if 1nt is what we suppose to mean|pg||
nt|petergill: something to be said for: calling a spade a spade, perhaps|pg||
nt|ralfwil: close to 6nt|pg||
nt|mdgraham: or even Two Spades|pg||
nt|petergill: yes|pg||
nt|petergill: Susan Stockdale knows that her @DK should be huge, being in partner's suit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: raise to 4NT?|pg||
nt|petergill: I think she will bid 4NT quantitative|pg||
nt|ralfwil: perhaps 4nt from W|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: nice fight by W = 5@C |pg||
nt|oleberg: 5@C is a nice save, -300|pg||
nt|corplaw: EW should bid and make 4H|pg||
nt|bagman: West not delighted if E can make a splinter|pg||
nt|ady: this is tough and go|pg||
nt|skaftij:  1NT = 14-16|pg||
nt|barnets: Italy are 5 victory points ahead of Poland - so this may be the decisive game in the championships|pg||
pc|h2|nt|lesh: but still it will be very agressive |pg||
nt|funtay: sry|pg||
nt|suketbombi: @D lead is a killer impossible to find @H lead gives awat @S there is a chance for declerar|pg||
nt|skaftij:  East's bid showing majors will help|pg||
nt|suketbombi: away|pg||
nt|ady: will need to get 3 heart tricks and block the diamond suit if their is a switch by playing low|pg||
nt|ady: will need to play a low heart from ssouth |pg||
nt|riccho: 1@h = TRF |pg||
pc|hQ|nt|eweber: but still, with 210 and 170 on my score card I wouldn't feel to good, it may not cost but surely won't bring in...|pg||
nt|andersk: even more exsiteing then bbo|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT hopless if they lead hearts   |pg||
nt|andreasw:  lol|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: dangerous reopenning here |pg||
nt|psridhar: thin 4s for EW , a lucky make -but imposs to get there unless pushed|pg||
nt|haans: but most of us would|pg||
nt|psridhar: South does have a good hand, cant fault him for reopening|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: what will North try to bid ?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think a similar example was in one of Ian Fleming's 007 JB books|pg||
nt|h_karluk: trappy sample|pg||
nt|lesh: I dont think North will pass|pg||
nt|lesh: South has showed 0-5 and 6+ spades but ...|pg||
nt|chick: N's hand is far too good|pg||
nt|chick: almost slam in hand|pg||
nt|lesh: 4@h is making|pg||
nt|chick: only problem is ... can he overcome his fear of 4-1 or 4-2 trump split in a red suit|pg||
nt|petergill: and then Fiona will probably pass, wanting one more diamond or one more highish card anywhere for 6NT|pg||
nt|ralfwil: With these two guys, you must be fast on the keyboard|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 4@S=620|pg||
nt|oleberg: If he gets diamonds right, which he will.|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 5@C=300 or 500|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Crikey, free lesson in Turkish|pg||
nt|mdgraham: is it really necessary to get to 2NT with the EW cards?|pg||

nt|paulhac:  Putting South to the test|pg||
nt|star6ija: 2@d game forcing|pg||

nt|jkmjanusz: Pani Agato! |pg||
nt|petergill: Fiona will like @D10, bulking up her long suit|pg||
nt|bagman: 2@S might be a start of a short suit trial|pg||
nt|idc: Oh, 3NT is on an earlier board|pg||
pc|c2|nt|rigas_karo: maybe he thought declarer hand 6421|pg||
nt|andersk: same lead as open room, probably 11 and a push|pg||
nt|Gerben42: you never know yesterday I saw Greco Hampson making 3N on 11 vs 10|pg||
nt|peachy: somebody took a long time, I assume|pg||
nt|roswolf: looks very possible|pg||
nt|shevek: they had some intervention by west who showed the blacks, still....|pg||
nt|dburn: quite a lot may depend on the lead to 6NT - @c10 (or@c9 depending on methods) will not work well|pg||
nt|dburn: but this is dangerous|pg||
nt|petergill: Ralf, or you will be burned ... am I still allowed to commentate after that?  |pg||
nt|ralfwil: :)|pg||
nt|petergill: 6@C, in case West has 5 clubs|pg||
nt|dburn: although West probably ought to convert to 6NT...|pg||
nt|petergill: A conversion to 6NT would avoid the nasty 5-1 split|pg||
nt|petergill: With 4 clubs, East might have proceeded via "fourth suit forcing"|pg||
nt|yusufb: 5@d|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes pactical as he can alwats finnease the @HT|pg||

nt|lesh: dangerous call|pg||
nt|chick: "pick another suit"|pg||
nt|lesh: he can even make 5@d|pg||
nt|lesh: 4@h and 5@d making but 3nt not |pg||
nt|chick: he can make 6H if he plays E for something like 4414 or 4405 ... losing 1 heart and no diamonds ... or am I missing something?|pg||
nt|james_h: I like Derek O'Gs raise|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: nice bid West|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: here is an example of a Vulnerable position safe for E-W|pg||
nt|brolucius: Not the sort of deal where you want to be playing against Italy...|pg||
nt|odysseus69: we are watching a Bocchi special- sadly I can offer no explanation|pg||
nt|bagman: 7@D here is a good contract|pg||

nt|pitiful:  well this is not very interesting|pg||
nt|pitiful:  @c lead best|pg||
nt|lesh: opps 3nt also makes:) He has the entry for @d finess|pg||
nt|lesh: he can but it is impossible to bid|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i whispered he could pass to 3NX but seems was busy a lot and did not hear me|pg||
nt|chick: entry for @D finesse is a problem|pg||
nt|chick: and 6@C EW is makeable too, I think|pg||
nt|lesh: slams are makeable but it is diffucult to reach. |pg||
nt|chick: I dunno, I'd still keep trying to reach a red slam with N's hand|pg||
nt|lesh: from the bidding you know what 4@h are 4-1 at least and there is 4th @d in West|pg||
nt|chick: yes, that's what is scaring N into serious caution|pg||
nt|lesh: your partner is 0-5 points with 6+ spades|pg||
nt|lesh: you dont expect him have K@hxx and 109x in @d|pg||
nt|chick: and nothing wasted in @Ss :)|pg||
nt|aldek: ale konsekwentne|pg||

nt|ozgull: pik empasý atýp fazla fazla batacak|pg||
nt|corplaw: now can make 5 on that lead|pg||
nt|suketbombi: well done|pg||
nt|tokay1975: thats  why he just didnot bid 3clubs|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|star6ija: still some communication problems|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: problems are arriving for N-S |pg||
nt|psridhar: but 3C x is painful all the same|pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: Przepraszam...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, that's avoided the 5-1 trump break |pg||
nt|dburn: good decision - now all East has to do is make it|pg||
nt|petergill: Good decision by Susan, but can 6NT be made?|pg||
nt|Walddk7: It can|pg||
nt|dburn: North will probably be squeezed in the majors even if East does not pick the clubs|pg||
nt|dburn: but on this auction South is not all that likely to lead the suit|pg||
nt|ralfwil: N is squeezed in majors|pg||
nt|Walddk7: She can get four club tricks by force|pg||
nt|petergill: South has to lead - what? - something ... the hearts and spades lie over West's holdings, reducing squeeze possibilities|pg||
nt|ralfwil: A squeese in more fun than a double finess:)|pg||
nt|Walddk7: If she is inspired and trust that @CJ is a singleton she has four tricks in the suit. The rest will come from diamonds|pg||
nt|petergill: East's 3rd heart might be a vital threat in this hand which even Fiona, usually a fast but careful player, will take a long time to play, surely|pg||
nt|Walddk7: She has just enough entries for all that|pg||
nt|dburn: but if South chooses the queen of hearts (which is dangerous), East may well go astray|pg||
nt|petergill: Sandra Rimstedt can hardly lead a club after this bidding, or will she?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: @HQ is a bit of a Flash Harry sort of lead|pg||
nt|ralfwil: When E can see a 5-card @c and a 4-card @d the squeeze is easy|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: always remember to make actions depending on the vul position |pg||
nt|barnets: and 7@H|pg||
nt|odysseus69: however many will open on West|pg||
pc|hK|nt|collins64: no Mike show count on J@d lead 7 cards so not possible |pg||
nt|MolvaM: to protect the @cQ and against bad breaks,|pg||
nt|justin c: looks like 5 losers here|pg||
nt|petergill: A low club lead is safe into the expected 4-3 fit - either partner has a bare @C honour or she does not|pg||
nt|Walddk7: That will likely give the show away|pg||
nt|dburn: well, that's a safe club to lead - declarer probably won't take four club tricks now|pg||
nt|petergill: NS lead 3rd and 5th versus both NT and suit|pg||
nt|Walddk7: I think she will, they lead 5th|pg||
nt|Walddk7: That's what I meant by giving the show away|pg||
nt|dburn: yes, but they also lead third - it would be a little vexing to lose to @cJ109 or the like with North|pg||
nt|petergill: A club lead from a 3 or 4 card holding is unlikely (being risky, might pick up partner's queen) on the bidding|pg||
nt|dburn: well, declarer lost her way at the other table, so this is a big chance for Fiona Brown|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: here is ths most advantaje Vulnerable position for a pair Non Vul - Vul = we are clear advantaje never hesitate to fight 1 more |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: remember te only bad safe is when you are getting paid 1 don and you decided to defend |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 1 down |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: as you can see West has no key cards to fight againtx 4@S|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|ady: got of to a bad lead    but still defence can recover  South will need to play a low heart when in with A@S   and north will have to read the position|pg||
nt|star6ija: decided by the defense|pg||
nt|andreasw:  Magnusson in control here and chose 6@h|pg||
nt|tomi2:  if he exited with a heart, Versace could have won the Jack and give partner a @D ruff to "get back" the 2 imps Kirmse was working for, but we don't know the cards exactly|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: so good 5@C|pg||
nt|corplaw: QS more sensible|pg||
pc|h8|nt|roswolf: the lead was i think another sols flight of fancy|pg||
nt|shevek: good choice|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes had Mag bid a cue Harald would bid 6@d and Mag had to make a choise|pg||
nt|andreasw:  after 4nt from harald ofcourse|pg||
nt|MolvaM: spade lead?|pg||
nt|andreasw:  small @h lead but could cost the beating trick|pg||
nt|MolvaM: and then another spade (when in with @hA) could create problems|pg||
nt|andreasw:  i would lead the @c|pg||
nt|MolvaM: declarer must refrain from cashing diamonds|pg||
nt|lesh: opps|pg||
nt|chick: N did well not to double :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: okay, if the input is correct now i belived much to that old saying in BG. "The wolf has a thick neck, because he does his job on his own. "|pg||
nt|skaftij:  not difficult, would plan to finesse for the 10 next round|pg||
nt|ady: home now     good board for Iceland|pg||
nt|psridhar: pretty thin 1nt overcall , will be -500|pg||

nt|peachy: NS in the other room preempted themselves from 4H, it can happen|pg||
nt|bogier: 1100 kosztowa³oby chyba|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But there is also a double squeeze if S has only a 4-card @d, so correctplay is to win on dummy, and play on @d|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is East who should be able to count 13 tricks at the end.|pg||
nt|bagman: 7@H is easy to play, win the first trick and play @HA and heart to the T|pg||
nt|bagman: How would you play 7NT?|pg||

nt|eweber: for NL|pg||
nt|pitiful:  looks like 9 tricks |pg||
nt|psridhar: Fredin may get his 800 'back' !|pg||
nt|petergill: Lucky it's not me who is declarer, I would take forever... . and I mean "forever" ... to play this hand|pg||
nt|bagman: with spades as the pivot suit|pg||
nt|corplaw: risks spade ruff, but then can pitch losing diamond on 4th spade to still make 4|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer is ready to give 2 trumps and a spade.|pg||
nt|bagman: Playing trumps would be dangerous as he could lose two trumps a spade and a diamond|pg||
nt|bagman: This guarantees the contract|pg||
nt|bagman: on the assumption that S has the @SJ|pg||
nt|corplaw: even if S led from Qx of spades, contract still guaranteed|pg||
nt|bagman: yes. Goes down only if the Q came from Q9x :9|pg||
nt|corplaw: Q from Q9x would be the master stroke :)|pg||
nt|corplaw: and even then only if KJx of hearts is offside|pg||

nt|idc: not doing it from then on has saved be thousands of points|pg||
nt|idc: *me|pg||
nt|psridhar: other day i saw Drijver/Brink overcall 1nt on a similar hand...but escped bcos they had some fancy runouts....they even found a 4-4 fit at 2 level which oppo cd not X|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Australia invented Ponting, and he is good|pg||
pc|cA|nt|star6ija: @h to the queen and home|pg||
nt|xenya: in the other room EW got to an inferior 4@S contract, which, however, had ther advantage of being makeable|pg||
nt|haans: here Fredin does not have a clue what E have|pg||
nt|barnets: on board 10 Justin H led a @S so expected swing for Italy|pg||
nt|cumino: 4NT = 2Key|pg||
pc|c4|nt|tomi2:  wladow will need to set up an extra @D trick now|pg||
nt|haans: South needed @CT and @C lead to bid more|pg||
nt|h_karluk: true, world soccer championship also exciting for many nations|pg||

nt|MolvaM: now take @hA and push another @s|pg||

pc|c7|nt|lmeili: !J |pg||

nt|ftpe: yes, a little lucky|pg||
nt|haans: really not bad|pg||
nt|haans: draw clubs and then spades = 3 spade tricks|pg||
nt|psridhar: Try as he might i dont see Herbst avoiding the 800|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: terry taking no chances ...|pg||
nt|james_h: but there are not many who do not|pg||
nt|petergill: She will pitch a spade and a heart from dummy on the @d's, to retain squeeze chances|pg||

nt|tomi2:  @DJ would be best|pg||
nt|tomi2:  wd|pg||
nt|ralfwil: well played and discard @h on @d|pg||
nt|corplaw: Sweden gets on the board when they punish a very light overcall on bd 8|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But to be fair, there is also a danger by passing|pg||
pc|h5|nt|pitiful:  4 more imps on board 11|pg||

nt|bagman: Now making 12 tricks|pg||
pc|s4|nt|psridhar: a small measure of revenge for the swedes as this 800 is against their 2s ! ( in contrast to the Israeli colln which was against their game ) :)|pg||
nt|Walddk7: regrets  even|pg||
nt|babs59: and Steve Waugh|pg||
nt|idc: No experiment on Bd 11 - I'm told they are in 3@d in OR as well|pg||
pc|s8|nt|8252: correct|pg||
nt|brolucius: This is like a long arrow, heading straight for the bulls-eye.|pg||
nt|psridhar: true - by passing 1c , u can kept out of the auction by an imaginative East|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|eamongall: I think its time to hit the road back to swords ...if they play slow I will be home in time for the wake |pg||

nt|odysseus69: old people like me dont mind responding 2C over 1D - is that so bizarre|pg||
nt|pikonlu: trefl atsa yapacak|pg||
pc|s7|nt|boyklas: by east sorry, he fillipos led small H manolis took the A and played a small D taking the A from the dummy so -1|pg||
nt|MolvaM: no problem|pg||
nt|MolvaM: dummy has a high heart|pg||
nt|andreasw:  still makeable|pg||
nt|psridhar: now 1100 even|pg||
nt|tomi2:  Smirnov Piekarek found some great defense against 3NT in board 10|pg||
nt|bagman: 7@D is more a bidding problem than a play problem. With trumps breaking it's easy to take a heart ruff|pg||
nt|cumino: Spade lead board 10 in 3NT|pg||
nt|sastro: alles ausser @C|pg||
pc|s6|nt|Gerben42: also an option to pass 1@H, then reaching 3/4@H is likely|pg||
nt|andreasw:  but a nice try|pg||
nt|petergill: When North showed out in clubs, Fiona will smartly think about North having length in both majors and being squeezable|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Which is a certainty when she cashes @D10|pg||
nt|mdgraham: from the photos, I'd say that both North and South are - no, I'd better not |pg||
nt|odysseus69: Roland go go go - the Don comes to mind|pg||
pc|sK|nt|pitiful:  the Dutch stopped in 2@s and the twins competed to 3@c which was mercifully not doubled down 2|pg||
nt|eamongall: 13.5 miles |pg||
nt|babs59: and Mike - there are plenty of Aussie inventions :)|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: well defended|pg||
pc|d5|nt|Gerben42: going down|pg||
nt|petergill: NS play upside down count, so Fiona is thinking that South has 4 @Ds and 5 @Cs|pg||
pc|d6|nt|collins64: Greece is back after deal 11|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: yes match can get close to a draw situation after hand nº 12 & 8 boards to play|pg||
nt|petergill: and not many major suit cards|pg||
nt|ralfwil: back on @sK|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Or cash @CK, then a heart|pg||
nt|petergill: If South is 3-1 in the majors, the timing to allow for both single and double squeeze possibilities is worth thinking about|pg||
nt|petergill: What to pitch from fummy on @d's is part of the problem|pg||
nt|petergill: @HQJ could be doubleton|pg||
nt|petergill: @S6 3rd and 5th - count-givers to the end|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @cK and a @s to @sk, @d10 and all is clear|pg||
nt|Walddk7: If Peter had been declarer, he would probably not have played to trick 1 yet|pg||
nt|petergill: Sandra Rimstedt and Emma Sjoberg play pro bridge at US Nationals, and do quite well there|pg||
nt|petergill: Roland is right|pg||
pc|d9|nt|odysseus69: the only question was how many bids it would take- actually I believe that many grnd slams are easier to bid than most small slams|pg||
nt|cumino: claim|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|ralfwil: WD!|pg||
nt|barnets: match close now|pg||
pc|cK|nt|Gerben42: so 100 is fine for NL|pg||
nt|pitiful:  declarer is possibly concerned that east has five @c's|pg||
nt|petergill: Nevena Senior found a good @H swtich at the other table, and then declarer chose to pitch a spade (not a club) from dummy, hoping for a @H and @c squeeze which did not eventuate|pg||
pc|d7|nt|eweber: well, this looked like 6 tricks from the start|pg||
pc|s5|pc|c8|pg||
nt|petergill: What to pitch from dummy = vital|pg||
nt|yusufb: degiþik sekilde 2 battý|pg||
nt|koksoy: -2  olacak..|pg||
nt|psridhar: long ago i read an article in Bridge world titled " how risky is not taking the risk" . covering the same topic|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|motu: das sollte der letzte stich fuer den alleinspieler gewesen sein|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|petergill: Sandra is Cecilia's elder sister|pg||
pc|sT|nt|Walddk2: Not only that; you may also hit partner with a balanced 10 count. No spade stopper, not 4 hearts. Then he won't re-open|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d8|pc|d3|nt|dburn: well, you can spare a club now - then @cK will squeeze North|pg||
nt|ralfwil: wrong now!|pg||

nt|jkmjanusz: Styanêli w 5@S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: moi aussi, sans la chance on est perdu|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@C 17+, 1@D 0-7, 1@H art forcing 20+|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Bye all|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: and 3@D= 6 card @D|pg||
nt|oleberg: Operator, are you sure Easts second bid was 2@H and not 2@D?|pg||
nt|sastro: gibt wenig zu spielen an der Hand|pg||
nt|athene: does it?|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|pitiful:  6@C is a playable spot here|pg||
nt|ftpe: i fully agree|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Unusual with an ace|pg||
nt|othered1:   An unusual treatment.|pg||
nt|lesh: 3@c pupet, 3@H no 4M, 3@s trf to 3nt|pg||
nt|odysseus69: will do well to rise|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it lasted two balls|pg||
nt|babs59: Though 'The Don' originated in NSW, we claim him in South Australia where he spent most of his test career|pg||
pc|sT|nt|peachy: E had a difficult lead decision|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Why doesÂ´nt East bid 2 @H in the first round|pg||
nt|haans: NORTH hand|pg||
nt|othered1: both with A and with stiff in partner's suit.|pg||
nt|antoniz: bêdzie p³askie|pg||
nt|bogier: dobry dla nas wynik w tym meczu pogr¹¿y  Holandiê  , a nam da wiate³ko w tunelu w nastêpnej fazie ME|pg||

nt|jkotor: móg³ jeszcze 3ba, ¿e nadwy¿kowa rêka i przejæ na CB|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 3NT = not an easy one !|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Bradman b Hollies 0|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Meanwhile back at the ranch, 2@H is not a happy spot with trumps 5-1|pg||
nt|babs59: we have a large street that was renamed Sir Donald Bradman Drive|pg||
nt|babs59: But my 6 degrees of separation is that his son bought the house I built|pg||
nt|suketbombi: a close match till bd 6 and Iceland have picked up 25+ imps since then|pg||
nt|skaftij:  @s switch best|pg||
nt|skaftij:  can be held to 7 tricks|pg||
nt|athene: hold up the ace of clubs and lead to the @DK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But wasn't it -2 even in the endgame?|pg||
nt|psridhar: now suddenly that -200 is looking like a possible danish gain if only the Italians overcall 1nt similarly..|pg||
pc|s3|nt|andersk: Italy is out of the world cup|pg||
nt|yuval10: good morning|pg||
nt|vasmar: good morning Yuval|pg||
nt|star6ija: I think they managed to play in same directions aiming to be shown on the Vugraph :)|pg||
nt|haans: 1@S to show 2 3 spade no extra|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2@C was forcing to game, so I suppose a 2@S continuation covers all the spade raises.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@H over 2@H would be a @H raise and @D shortness|pg||
nt|othered1: and with no side shortness?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Let me ask giammi|pg||
nt|8252: sans les @s, on a du mal aussi|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: 2 off for sure|pg||
nt|barnets: anyone see a twelfth trick in hearts ?|pg||
nt|brolucius: East known to have long clubs, so Townsend is suspicious of the @S8 switch and declines the finesse.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: well done - cant be bad|pg||
nt|jkotor: yap, sorry, no entry|pg||
nt|athene: now he has time to get a club away on a heart|pg||
nt|athene: but he might just play for @DQ right|pg||
nt|tokay1975: still cannot make i thk|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Gerben42: now at least 2|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@S 0-4|pg||
nt|petergill: or balanced|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: fireworks =X 3nt by North |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: way tis X ?|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: somebody ?|pg||
nt|oleberg: X asked for a diamond-lead, dummy's suit|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: well he knows |pg||
nt|ozgull: natürel de gitse zor|pg||
nt|riccho: Schnitt und Cl|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Official scoring and BBO differ by an imp in this match|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|eweber: while this one would only promise a swing if the open NS pair weren't playing strong NT, but they are|pg||
nt|ady: now 6 easy tricks    I am sure a 7th will come|pg||
nt|shevek: I'm told 2@s is 8-10 , 6@s|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: nice K@C helping card showing to secuence & giving parner a relax moment to tell him your lead made no damagge to defence|pg||
nt|marlowepi: meme cela revient a la chance:)|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 1- both opps are not strong |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 2- he has the @D controled |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 3-he has a lot of confidence |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 15/1 up|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 4- is not a part score not much dange on this x|pg||
nt|oleberg: Or at least the double shows, that diamonds is controlled, and south should be vary, leading from honours|pg||
nt|ralfwil: this lead makes that N can win the @d immediately and return another @s|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: tricks count |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: East |pg||
nt|oleberg: 3@D must have been invitational, so the double is "safe"|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 3@S+2@H+1@C=7 |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: he needs to develope the @D |pg||
nt|ralfwil: only 6 tricks from top, so let us see|pg||
nt|oleberg: the lead is a killer|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: sorry 6 yes |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: remember siesta time for Spanish people |pg||
nt|oleberg: This will always take at least 7 tricks, 6 obvious ones, and seventh cannot help but being devellopped|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: Siesta= good life in spain / relax moment and here we are fighting in this match :)|pg||
pc|s5|nt|pitiful:  safe play by declarer|pg||
nt|mamos: making safe|pg||
nt|pitiful:  leaving trump in dummy to ruff @s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2NT= asking for min/max and distribution. Denies @S raise, may have @H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So they go through 2NT with a balanced heart raise|pg||
nt|riccho: eigentlich... |pg||
nt|motu: wenn man da kontriert wird weiss man nicht ob man drin bleiben soll oder lieber 3@C reizen sollte|pg||
nt|tokay1975: yes with dia guess |pg||
nt|odysseus69: ok if he played hearts and guessed diamonds but is that right play- d finesse looks simpler|pg||
pc|s9|nt|boyklas: 5C at boar 12|pg||
nt|rnmalik: would require some play.|pg||
nt|andersk: this contract is not makeable|pg||
nt|pitiful:  i saw symonds play the other night for Surrey|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://tinyurl.com/39bvxwu  for running scores|pg||
pc|sK|nt|haans: do not understand low spade|pg||
nt|Walddk7: At TGR they would probably play this in 3NT in order collect 150 honours|pg||
nt|petergill: This gives declarer an entry to dummy for the doomed trump finesse|pg||
nt|koksoy: 4@H  e  gerek  yoktu..  ancak  3@C  yaptýrýp  110  verecegimize  3@H +1 170  alsaydýk...|pg||
nt|ozgull: ama yinede bir partskor kaybý gibi|pg||
nt|ady: will need to play east for doubleton K@H|pg||
nt|j li: Aber 2@S verpflichtet direkt zur 3er Stufe|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|boyklas: boar|pg||
nt|shevek: I think it also suggests shortage in @h|pg||
nt|chick: can make 6, but I predict only 5 ... will set up @Ds, they will knock out the other @S stopper, and he won't dare take the @H finesse|pg||
nt|petergill: Declarer has to misguess a lot in order to fail|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Welcome to Jaap Frijling|pg||
nt|jkotor: board 7, 3@s same as here, fighting between -1 and -2|pg||
pc|d2|nt|collins64: Mike 14 HCP opening is not going to run good here|pg||
nt|eweber: wow, another 11 for NL|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Spade lead looked normal|pg||
nt|athene: lauria-versace got some way towards 4@H - just not all the way|pg||
nt|pitiful:  you mentioned flash boys|pg||
nt|lesh: with doubleton Q@d and Q@c and @H finess working he can even make 12 tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That is an excellent switch, it will set up a club trick in time|pg||
pc|d3|nt|peachy: 3Nt was better since hearts 4-4, but one never knows|pg||
nt|chick: hmm, now he may have to take the @H finesse|pg||
nt|lesh: however,what is more important is to make your contract|pg||
nt|jkotor: lol, dosta³em na priv pytanie, |pg||
nt|cumino: if they don't lead @D|pg||
nt|suketbombi: cud aways guess the @HS to make the 8th on the @S switch asthe cards are but much easier now|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|rnmalik: cannot rule out an error by the defense.|pg||
nt|eweber: 26:4 now|pg||
nt|MolvaM: the iceland pairs doing extremely well in the event|pg||
nt|jaapfr: hoi Roland et all:)|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|MolvaM: one pair ranked 1st in butler with 1,66 imp/board|pg||
nt|MolvaM: other 2 pairs also high with 0,84 and 0,3 plus|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 1,66 imp average over 100 boards is phenomenal|pg||
nt|xenya: well at least it served as a lead director|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 9@D a very strong card in N|pg||
nt|bagman: Surprise @CA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So maybe we will see 500 on 12 after all|pg||
nt|idc: Note that Finland are fighting back v Poland, so Italian lead back up to 6 VPs|pg||
nt|psridhar: the play record in this room shows -2 only though the score entered is d1|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The Italians also caught in 1NTX on 12. Now they are running|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and at this point they are doubled in 2@C. Auction not over|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@DX it is|pg||
mc|10|nt|Gerben42: thanks to the 3@S opener|pg||
nt|bagman: The defense can get 800 if they make no mistake. Often a trick is dropped|pg||
nt|bagman: and declarer escapes with -500|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Oh well, not when West did not win the first diamond|pg||
nt|koksoy: 2@D  ya  kontur   nedir ?  diger  renkler  ??    yoksa  karolarmý  ??... |pg||
nt|yusufb: 1@c pas 1@s 2@c olursa N eli 2@h diye uyandýrabilir|pg||

nt|athene: on the basis that if the @DQ is onside, the other declarer will make anyway|pg||

mb|p|nt|Gerben42: but 10-13 look solid Dutch results|pg||

nt|udo: 2@S stört mehr, zeigt mehr, verrät aber auch mehr,   kann alles richtig sein,, ich bevorzuge aber 2@S,,|pg||
nt|athene: or maybe he is going the other way, thinking that if the other declarer is in 3nt, he will be forced to lead to @DK because of west having cashing clubs|pg||
nt|athene: so he wants to avoid a game swing out|pg||
nt|jkotor: lol, but what if there is no @c lead this hand?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And it has been confirmed that it actually *was* 500 on board 12 in this room|pg||
mb|1S|nt|shevek: 4@s might be a reasonable spot here|pg||
mb|p|nt|andersk: pls correct to minus 3|pg||
nt|eweber: if the medals were given for speed this table would probably qualify :)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: they will have to wait for their partners quite some time throughout the tournament|pg||
nt|Gerben42: Bauke Muller is not known to be fast|pg||
nt|eweber: 1@d here showed 11-16 with 4+ @d, unbalanced|pg||
nt|Gerben42: showing 4+@D paid off here|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 5@S still cheap for 300|pg||
nt|eweber: and the limit is useful as well|pg||
nt|eweber: in such auctions|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 6@D must be defended carefully, but I think after @S2 lead Drijver will get it|pg||
nt|eweber: with 7 hcp in @s 5@s is an option|pg||
nt|vasmar: double now|pg||
nt|ady: played a diamond to the 9 early on to make 4@S on board 9|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D game try in hearts perhaps but NS should wander into 4@S without too much difficulty |pg||
nt|athene: 3@S pass 4@S now|pg||
nt|pitiful:  5@c a nice spot here|pg||
nt|justin c: might try 6@H here|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Operator, could you please correct that?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Here is the code ...|pg||
nt|idc: I just reviewed the play and was about to say the same|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1NNX-2|pg||
nt|psridhar: 2D x is not less than 500 if defense leads trumps as they shd|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Click on MOVIE, put your mouse to board 12 and overwrite 1NNX-2|pg||
nt|psridhar: 2 tricks each in S/H/D for decl at best|pg||
nt|idc: meanwhile, this is a fun hand in prospect too|pg||
nt|psridhar: grand|pg||
mb|4N|nt|shevek: Unfortunately losing 2@h - 1@d - 1@c|pg||
nt|lesh: 4@h and 4@s are making,just need to be reached|pg||
nt|petergill: OK, David is right, if @SK was from KJ doubleton the play for the overtrick risks the contract|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: the normal action practicly is ths K@C from KQ ending the defence  I enjoyed that detail|pg||
nt|odysseus69: that means there snt 1 - I never try for unbid slams- not enough grey cells|pg||
nt|udo: weches Vollspiel ist das chancenreichste auf OW ?|pg||

mb|p|nt|Gerben42: at least the auction heated up some :)|pg||

nt|odysseus69: or maybe because he had a feeling for the diamond position |pg||
nt|jkotor: i do not respond on messages "why B-¯ does not play this match?", plz dont priv me|pg||
nt|Walddk2: LOL|pg||
pc|d8|nt|shevek: will get away with -50|pg||
nt|shevek: instead of +50|pg||
nt|mdgraham: could also be a sign-off in hearts|pg||
nt|athene: @DK lead at some point takes out the entry to the clubs, so he can't discard his diamond loser|pg||
nt|odysseus69: indecently fortunate lie of cards for 4H but is it enough|pg||
nt|psridhar: he did reach his top spot |pg||
nt|idc: Science is for people in white coats; Berg has no time for such nonsense :)|pg||
nt|psridhar: rather swiftly|pg||
pc|d5|nt|vugraphzng: seems to be clqi;end for -2, correction will come later if needed|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Diamonds 3-3 or doubleton J|pg||
nt|andersk: I have to go for a few|pg||
nt|tomi2:  he upgraded his hand to 18 with those aces and kings|pg||
nt|snetram:  teraz operator|pg||
nt|babs59: Will they be able to stop short of slam now?|pg||
nt|suketbombi: a 50% slam here (slightly less) for e-w a 4@C bid showing good clubs and a max wud hav e helped|pg||
nt|udo: mit stärkeren Blätern zuerst Kontra|pg||
nt|riccho: jetzt sind es 9 einfache stiche|pg||
nt|j li: Der Überraschungsangriff - Kirmse nimmt wenig überrascht neun Stiche mit|pg||
nt|riccho: server hakt in Belgien? Selbst Andreas dürfte hier nicht viel zu denken haben|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe not the top spot. 7@C is probably the best grand slam|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|vasmar: now small diamond works also|pg||
nt|vasmar: if S misguesses|pg||
nt|ady: low diamond lead will beat this|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: puppet + 3@s showing hearts|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: there he is nice 4@S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: TGry to bid that on 4-2 :)|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|eweber: non vul doubling for -1 is a bad bargain when the contract may be made, none of them knows about the opther one's quick tricks|pg||
nt|ady: thlow spade lead also good enough|pg||
nt|mamos: just Hearts I'm told|pg||
nt|andreasw:  they were not in 4@s|pg||
nt|shevek: phantoms , yes :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Ivan was good enough to find it, grats|pg||
nt|bogier: 2BA wychodzi - 3@D raczej nie|pg||
nt|jkotor: 2ba wygl¹da na -1, ale oppsy otworzyli kara od strony W i =|pg||

nt|oleberg: Well, 12 tricks are easy, on the friendly lay.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 6@s as @d are AJ|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: hand 13 playing 3NT but other side & not X |pg||
nt|odysseus69: it seems that nobody knows what to expecxt from preempts - its because players are varying them so much|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't think so, and slam is not that bad|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's basically on a finesse|pg||
nt|babs59: 6@C is the best slam|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6@C can make when diamonds are 3-3 or queen doubleton|pg||
nt|corplaw: looks like 2D should make exactly|pg||
nt|athene: so even though west has no entry, the defence should take a diamond, a club and two spades|pg||
nt|psridhar: after the dia lead Berg will take his extra 80 points|pg||
nt|idc: Hmmm, well spotted Roland, I like how sick your mind is :)|pg||
pc|c5|nt|peachy: nicely judged|pg||
nt|peachy: as it is, 12 tricks|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Unless he takes a diamond finesse|pg||
nt|peachy: if they duck club, it will be testy|pg||
nt|brolucius: If yo use 12-14 and 15-17 as your ranges for 1NT and the 1NT rebid, a jump rebid of 2NT shows 18-19. They must do something different since West has only 17 here.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Hardly worth an upgrade, with those intermediates, it would seem.|pg||
nt|tomi2:  @S2 gives you the count of the spades, they should behave 4-4|pg||
nt|othered1: Giving an extra Work point or two when  you have only aces and kings is reasaonable, perhaps mandatory|pg||
nt|bagman: NS had 5@C or 5@D, going 1 or 2 down in 4@S is no disaster here|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ady: heart contract for 9 tricks best  |pg||
nt|haans: he had been thinking|pg||
nt|mcarroll: They dont listen to you Hans :)|pg||
nt|haans: see that|pg||
nt|haans: why not clubs to 9|pg||
nt|star6ija: 3rd hand plays high?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 6 clubs needs help from defence - preferably diamond lead- 6NT no chance |pg||
nt|athene: or failing that east could just switch to a small club here|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|rigas_karo: well, at least this is NV :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: might be a few twists and turns though|pg||
nt|star6ija: no entries for dummy|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 4@H+2 =480 |pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer cannot get the diamonds wrong so he has 6 tricks there and gets at least one spade and either a @H or a @C|pg||
nt|bagman: Here most of the guesses work|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|andersk: ty|pg||
nt|Gerben42: @H ruff is -2 |pg||
nt|yuval10: she indeed misguessed|pg||
nt|athene: small club after the @DA gives declarer a nasty moment but the odds must be to rise king|pg||
nt|athene: west would indeed lead low from @CQJxx, knowing the suit has to run, but it's more likely he simply has the ace|pg||
nt|aldek: non-vulnerable could be very weak|pg||
nt|mamos: not a great bid then imho   it made any exploration of the hands here impossible|pg||
nt|shevek: Thomas would've bid 4@s if it came around|pg||
nt|andreasw:  and then u could bid 5@c with the risk of being dbl but still u never now|pg||
nt|shevek: true, they bid it to make|pg||
nt|lechcold: 2BA nieestetyczne z uwagi na dziurê w treflach|pg||
nt|jkotor: sorry, spojrza³em, ¿e oba króle nie stoj¹...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: en toute probabilite, 300 a 5Kx je crois|pg||
nt|justin c: west might have preferred 4@C to 4@h |pg||
nt|petergill: NS play Two Way Checkback after 1@H - 1@S - 1NT|pg||
nt|petergill: so 2@C would have been artificial|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: instead E is playing West|pg||
nt|babs59: you can discard the 3rd @D on the @H, when @DQ doesn't drop - then @S to dummy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why help, Victor?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You pitch a diamond on a heart|pg||
nt|odysseus69: take me through play please|pg||
nt|bagman: The only losing case is to play W for AJ|pg||
nt|jkotor: and there is no way to play from Hand|pg||
nt|tokay1975: defense is not easy|pg||
nt|jkotor: small @c also beats it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Wasn't me, some other Dane in the audience|pg||
pc|c3|nt|shevek: flat board|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Give the hand to K&R and ask what it's worth|pg||
nt|aldek: ktora nie idzie|pg||
nt|snetram:  a 3 karo nie wyjdzie|pg||
nt|barnets: it is though a very intersting question why one of the best 4 pairs in the word are stting on the sidelines as the championship is dcided|pg||
nt|athene: or even a third spade is ok, because after leading to the @CK, declarer has no way back to hand to lead another one up|pg||
nt|barnets: in the world|pg||
pc|c6|nt|haans: @H to Q and they forget to take two @D|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 3@D we can take it as a trial bid |pg||
nt|yusufb: 8@s altýn|pg||
nt|bagman: or for J only if a low comes now|pg||
pc|cA|nt|haans: they did forget|pg||
nt|antoniz: tak jest -1|pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: 2@D,2@S,2@C|pg||
nt|justin c: but unclear whether East can cooperate over that|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|peachy: good lead, gives nothing away|pg||
nt|lesh: thanks everyone, I have to go|pg||
nt|babs59: however, 6@C (by South) on a @S lead is trickier|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It is true that a spade lead kills the entry|pg||
nt|babs59: I missed the ruffing the 13th @D good, before going back to the @S - so 5 clubs, 3 hearts, 3 diamonds, 1 spade|pg||
nt|odysseus69: I see how but is that likely line- and of couse spade lead finishes it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, but there is an alternative, and losing, line|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe even a better one|pg||
nt|babs59: Just one?  I see the @D finesse, or trying for short @SA, or a squeeze|pg||
nt|Walddk2: diamond finesse in combination with @SA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: doubleton|pg||
pc|cK|nt|pitiful:  well if that is your style and it works well for you you tend to stick to it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Kaplan & Rubens Hand Evaluator|pg||
nt|tomi2:  we will need some undo here|pg||
pc|c8|nt|koksoy: herhalde  batmaz...  karolar  partaj  (3-3)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|dburn: looks natural to play a spade now, but I don't think it will work|pg||
nt|odysseus69: and as my friend Tony Waterlow pointed out if he guesses to play spade Q on Jack he is stil ok - all very inspired|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|ady: no way to make unless north discards 2 clubs when hearts are run|pg||
nt|chick: thanks Jivko@H@H|pg||
nt|aldek: 2BA nie mozna przegrac|pg||
nt|oleberg: The underlead looked costly, but gained a trick|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You need @SK as an entry if you go for diamonds (no finesse)|pg||
nt|bagman: E sees that most of the suits are frozen so attacks the trumps|pg||
nt|odysseus69: dont think the 3S bid was right- didnt suggest heart void o me|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They spot impossible contracts in a split second|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|vasmar: plenty of tricks now for N-S nut not enough ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 18.3 on the K&R so an upgrade was fine|pg||
pc|d4|nt|rigas_karo: @d now for -3|pg||
nt|yuval10: big board for Germany|pg||
nt|ady: south likely to discard 2 diamonds and a club|pg||
nt|roswolf: well i think this can make by force but timing needs to be exacrt|pg||
pc|s4|nt|brolucius: Declarer went against Restricted Choice in the heart suit.|pg||
nt|jkotor: Janusz jedn¹ lewê zdejmij|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|paulhac:  He may be able to work out the distribution in which case he may well go off|pg||
nt|peachy: cashing spades to get information on shapes and discards, not sure if it will help him|pg||
nt|santyclz: I'm sure I could convince myself to go wrong there.|pg||
nt|athene: now Mari gets squeezed in the minors|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: sweden made another 5 Imp,s move on board 13|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 12 has been corrected now, thanks operator|pg||
mc|13|nt|tomi2:  couldnt he first duck out a club?|pg||
nt|brolucius: 10-x or J-x with South was more likely than J-10-x.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, as a matter of principle they don't read books by Englishmen. They beat them in football instead|pg||
nt|tomi2:  :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: A matter of Principle.|pg||

nt|pitiful:  initially David was not enjoying the auction, now it is Tom's turn to join in|pg||

nt|odysseus69: i did suggest d10|pg||
nt|ady: surprising to go to 5@S by north     should pass round for south to decide|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes and @S need to be 2/2 for 5@s wise to settle for 500 but..|pg||
nt|jkotor: from good 15 he could have jump 3@d|pg||
nt|Walddk2: On one occasion Fredin was blamed. The trouble was that he was not West in that match, but East. So all partner's faults were blamed on Fredin. He was not a happy camper I can tell ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: you|pg||
nt|idc: not BBO I should add, but official EBL hand records|pg||
pc|d3|nt|peachy: NT will be a poor strain this time, one can only hope they dont bid 3|pg||
nt|lmeili: good gor Germany, no double|pg||
nt|pitiful:  interesting lead for south|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: chance here if E/W can produce some red cards|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: actually plays quite well 3@d be close|pg||
nt|petergill: Even if you play Simple Stayman, responding 3@H or 3@S with a max with a 5 card suit to simple Stayman is a pretty good idea IMO, rarely costs|pg||
nt|petergill: No reason to get spades wrong, as far as I can see|pg||
nt|ozgull: batýnýn 5 pik demesini bekliyoruz :)|pg||
nt|tokay1975: i thk  alfredo passed  automatically this  hand|pg||
nt|athene: south in the other room will surely open 2@H|pg||
pc|d6|nt|boyklas: -2 now with a small H|pg||
nt|eweber: and now the wrong hand decl. in a spade contract|pg||
nt|ziff:  No double, no trouble|pg||
nt|pitiful:  how many down?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maths + psychology. Maybe he has a point|pg||
nt|yusufb: 3@s deyince salvo @d dayalý elini anlattý þimdiki 4nt gereksiz bence|pg||
nt|corplaw: another hand where lead from longest suit works best|pg||
nt|corplaw: an original low club lead though could set contract 2 tricks|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer has enough entries to take care of JTxx in South so West is quite happy now|pg||
nt|barnets: many mesages coming in from the spectators roland i have about 20|pg||
nt|athene: and now west might leap into action with leaping michaels|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|eweber: and probably no chance to find the 2nd fit|pg||
nt|motu: hard to dbl for N|pg||
nt|MolvaM: now a non heart lead could bring overtrivk|pg||
nt|andreasw:  will bring a overtrcik but a @h lead look's fair|pg||
nt|andreasw:  then again east could have dbl 1@h|pg||

nt|oleberg: The @SA cannot be taken prematurely|pg||
nt|barnets: @CAQ|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Russia made 6C -|pg||
nt|mdgraham: much needed|pg||
pc|s4|nt|MolvaM: would that just ask for a lead or show a real suit?|pg||

nt|lechcold: wygl¹da ¿e to nie idzie|pg||
nt|athene: 2@H - 4@D now it's hard to bid 3nt|pg||
nt|jkotor: no way for 2@h opening|pg||
nt|barnets: and trying to deal with them|pg||
nt|tokay1975: because  the  set had  lots of bad distrubution hands|pg||
nt|athene: ah right of course in polish methods it's a 2@D opener |pg||
nt|jkotor: they play 2@d multi :)|pg||
nt|tokay1975: and he is believing this|pg||
nt|athene: ok, so 2@D 4@D leaping michaels the same|pg||
nt|tokay1975: he follows the set|pg||
nt|tokay1975: vul against nvul  he just followed the set|pg||
nt|tokay1975: he works  on this for years  i am sure|pg||
nt|me argent: this will be tough to beat|pg||
nt|athene: you mean "bad breaks on previous boards, so bad breaks on this one?" that's sort of mad isn't it?|pg||
nt|athene: that's like "head, head, head, next one MUST be tails"|pg||
nt|tokay1975: this is very strange for all  of us not to open 2h|pg||
nt|tokay1975: yes he works  on this|pg||
pc|sA|nt|yuval10: over @s lead, S needs to signal what she has|pg||
nt|yuval10: for me it's 7@s indicating @d|pg||
nt|ady: 4 tricks or 8 on heart finesse |pg||
nt|dburn: well, he has six tricks|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 9 tricks |pg||
nt|haans: know that @H wrong|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: a seniorsi 48-30 z Walij¹|pg||
nt|oleberg: And a squeeze of East is lurking, but much to double-dummy to find|pg||
nt|tokay1975: but thats why he is versace|pg||
pc|sK|nt|peachy: Not sure what subesequent bidding showed. |pg||
nt|hawe45:  South throws trick away|pg||
nt|athene: NS lead attitude against notrumps - definitely favoured amongst the top italian players|pg||
nt|dburn: so I guess that's four down|pg||
nt|pitiful:  i was thinking 3|pg||
nt|koksoy: umarým   @C  V yi  bulur|pg||

nt|vasmar: true|pg||
nt|yuval10: will help P not to play @c here|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 1 imp for wales now|pg||
nt|oleberg: the defence to 6@H should be possible to find|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: Iceland on the lead 16/15 |pg||
nt|ralfwil: too high is always selfdefending:)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: however not on scoreboard yet|pg||
nt|idc: That must be what hell is like: for eternity you have to watch partner butcher hands|pg||
nt|idc: then you get blamed for the mistakes   *shudder*|pg||
pc|d4|nt|vasmar: she must continue spades now|pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: Nie - Operator sie grobn¹³. Rozgrywaka jeszcze trwqa|pg||
nt|barnets: so there are 4 cards left in each hand|pg||
nt|odysseus69: yes a good result|pg||
nt|tokay1975: hard to understand but  he is working on this  |pg||
nt|psridhar: without the X of 1N that raise to 3D is normal enuf; but with the X, Berg might hv considered passing 2d |pg||
pc|d5|nt|dburn: yes, but you're not defending|pg||
nt|pitiful:  i know 4 looks likely but sometimes 1 gets away |pg||
nt|dburn: oh, sure - no one ever believes how bad the contract actually is|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: time for a good think by east |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: A@S or not ?|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: A@S makes = 12 tricks asOle told us |pg||
nt|oleberg: No 11|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If my partner lead @s2 he has an honour..... |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: so defence needs to put J@S|pg||
nt|oleberg: There is always a heart-loser|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: true there is a 9@H problem there good point by specs|pg||
nt|oleberg: But the @SJ will keep declarer to 10 tricks|pg||
pc|d7|nt|yusufb: þimdi @s gelirse ne atýcak:)|pg||
nt|koksoy: ufak  kör  gelme  :)|pg||
nt|bagman: Now north is hoping that West has Qx of clubs|pg||
nt|corplaw: another possible large swing to bulgaria|pg||
nt|bagman: He knows he cannot beat the contract any more and hopes that it was makeable with any lead|pg||
nt|riccho: Sieht nach billig 2 down aus. Wenn die defense noch was probiert ist es vielleicht auch nur 1 down...|pg||
nt|psridhar: of course S might hv had a distributional hand making 5d attractive|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|snetram:  tu moÅ¼e byc bez jednej|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: I think S meant 2NT as pick a minor over 3@C would decide whether to pass or not|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|Gerben42: 13 tops now |pg||
nt|petergill: With 9 trumps, you play for the drop, and with 8 trumps you finesse the queen, unless the bidding and/or play suggests otherwise |pg||
nt|oleberg: It is always 11 (thx kibz) |pg||
pc|s2|nt|dburn: for example, Brink may not believe he can give Drijver a spade ruff, because that would mean East's bidding is completely berserk|pg||
nt|pitiful:  surely not Ace|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Alternatively, you can cash @DAK to see if the queen falls, if not go for the ruffing out line|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ziff:  The contract could be cold, or he might give away the position|pg||
nt|vasmar: now it makes easily|pg||
nt|andreasw:  dosent matter u have no problm in 2@h x if opp,s have the 4@s|pg||
nt|tomi2:  I am a fan of nfb, but not sure everybody agrees :)|pg||
nt|bogier: jest|pg||

nt|koksoy: simdi  trefl  valeye  kaldý|pg||
nt|ozgull: eðer asý çekmez ise|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If there is a hell, then it will consist of being at PO Sundelin's table while he makes three overtricks in 2@C redoubled. Slowly.|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|athene: south doesn't see any future in hearts for the defence - he doesn't know how few declarer has, for one thing|pg||
nt|petergill: Susan is obtaining information about the layout before she commits herself in spades|pg||
nt|barnets: dec needs to take a spade ruff in dummy to engineer this|pg||

nt|odysseus69: 2 service breaks for Murray in 3rd set|pg||

pc|s5|nt|boyklas: 16-18 Balanced|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Trump split painful for declarer|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You can have 1NT as a transfer to 2@C|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am told: Duboin makes 3NT on 14. gets @s2 and shoots a @s straight back! When nobody wants to cash out the spades, he ducks a club.|pg||
nt|tomi2:  In poland 99.9 % play non forcing, in Germany we have lots of influences in bidding and defense, some from French bidding style, some from American books and some from Polish players, because some German players are Polish origin, like Piekarek |pg||
nt|ryskiel_: i wemie|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 7 tricks now|pg||
nt|barnets: not really a good effort by them|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6NT made at some tables on 14. It should not have|pg||
nt|ady: yes Iceland doing a lot right|pg||

nt|suketbombi: yes david even if the opponents are pushed to 3@H @HS need to be guesse in view of the 3@C bid|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 2dn cud be the result|pg||
nt|ady: Israel do have a chance on hand 14  if they bid the round about 50-50 slam|pg||
nt|skaftij:  migth play side suits, trying to figure out distribution|pg||
pc|sA|nt|rnmalik: 11 tricks.|pg||
nt|ady: dont think east's pass wrong    has already shown values with 2NT|pg||
nt|ady: north sure to get diamonds right|pg||
nt|roswolf: west might/should have bid 4@H but i would have done more as east on this auction|pg||
nt|psridhar: whatever their methods were , this 2nt is not pretty on club lead|pg||
nt|psridhar: i fancy -200|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|shevek: no they play mini NT not vul (10-12)|pg||
nt|tomi2:  in the OR, so you see some pairs playing SEF based style, some 2/1 and some use polish club and polish style bids and carding|pg||
nt|8252: il protège les @c en duquant, et espère l'AS d'atout an Nord, ou un gisement des @s favorable|pg||
nt|bagman: This lead was quite helpful for the declarer. With the cards being nice it did not matter much, however|pg||
nt|mdgraham: or, as happened on a memorable occasion, four of something doubled|pg||
nt|odysseus69: not too many entries to South|pg||
nt|bagman: brb|pg||
nt|barnets: had west a short club east would have tried for slam|pg||
nt|idc: The danger is NS will set up a @s for declarer|pg||
pc|s6|nt|paulg:  at least he can pitch a heart on the fourth spade|pg||
nt|hawe45:  120 - next|pg||
nt|shevek: http://tinyurl.com/29ud57z|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|collins64: A@c for the 10@c|pg||
nt|pitiful:  probably watching the cricket with Roland...|pg||
nt|pitiful:  looks like 9 tricks here|pg||
nt|xenya: now 2 hearts pitching 2 diamonds -- that must be his plan?|pg||
nt|ftpe: he probably knows cl 3-3, so maybe will play on clubs|pg||
nt|xenya: but that would lead to a defeat i think -- discarding diamonds i mean|pg||
nt|xenya: and trying to ruff a @D loser in the dimmy|pg||
nt|suketbombi: guessed the @Hs alright|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Iceland has the chance on bd 14|pg||
pc|sK|nt|haans: many plax xx as forcing to at lead 2nt|pg||
nt|brolucius: It will be interesting to see how many pairs reach 7@D. Perhaps a majority at this level.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: now David did you say you wanted to be kept up to date with cricket?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If they believe declarer has a spade stopper, then they should get it right|pg||
nt|idc: and not realize they have @h to cash|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|collins64: and @s|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: creative bidding would  be my guess:)|pg||
nt|paulg:  although not an ideal start to a doubled four-level contract|pg||
nt|haans: just to tease|pg||
nt|barnets: very good system|pg||
nt|psridhar: very tough|pg||
nt|idc: time to count points though|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Easy for us, very difficult at the table|pg||
nt|psridhar: now the odds are with declarer|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Berg can't be sure that declarer has 8 tricks in the minors|pg||
nt|psridhar: Brg will be aware of the running minors however|pg||
nt|idc: but his @d could be 9 high I guess, and defence get 3 @s, @ha and @dK|pg||
nt|psridhar: vul rebid of 2d.....doesnt come on cheese|pg||
pc|sT|nt|vasmar: club was not a success|pg||
nt|star6ija: 3rd trump trick apeared|pg||
nt|corplaw: NS had a spade partial|pg||
nt|corplaw: W should expect that N has no more clubs, since S wouldn't be setting up dummy|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ziff:  Of course he didn t lead @H8 as he had no idea where @HA is, but it would sure have been fun :)|pg||
nt|psridhar: S will duck dia queen to cut declarer off his hand|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 23/19 getting closer te match |pg||
nt|psridhar: perhpas Fallenius might hv tried 2S over Fredin's 2D- a much better spot than 2nt|pg||
nt|haans: so fredin just had to countinue bidding|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 2nt a contract you bid but you never play|pg||
nt|psridhar: Israel are in 2H other room as EW|pg||
nt|psridhar: Denmark leading 51-7 vs Estonia after bd 16|pg||

pc|sJ|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: same|pg||
nt|xenya: in the OR, the lead was a safe a heart |pg||
nt|psridhar: Russia up 4--15 vs Ireland with one bd to go|pg||
nt|marlowepi: mieux|pg||
nt|me argent: mais avec les 2K noir mal places il va chuter|pg||
nt|ritong: il est tres probable que l autre salle atteindra aussi ce tres bon contrat|pg||
nt|bernix: .|pg||

nt|koksoy: kýrmýzý  renkleri  ellememek  cok  zordu ...  tam  oldu|pg||
nt|Walddk2: sigh|pg||
pc|d2|nt|vasmar: there may be a club spade squeeze|pg||
nt|psridhar: 40-15|pg||
nt|mdgraham: years ago in the Spring Foursomes - partner and I doubled 2@D. The oppo removed, and ended in 4@Dx. Not a success |pg||
pc|dT|nt|paulg:  bidding 4@c would have given someone the option of running if doubled (although never easy to work out when to run) ... 4@d has no such safety valve|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Could easily play East for KQ@C doubleton and go for 800|pg||
nt|xenya: well now he MUST discard diamonds on the hearts |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: big smash there fron denmark |pg||
nt|odysseus69: I hear that Hacketts bid 6NT|pg||
nt|bagman: declarer is still going to lose a spade and a diamond|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Back to that slam on 14. At one table where the contract was 6NT, West avoided the diamond lead, but the contract still made when East rose with the ace (low spade from dummy)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: better to win spade ace and take 2 ruffs then diamond jack gets promoted|pg||
nt|idc: Hmm, 3-2-6-2 shape possible?  Maybe 3@c bid is unlikely then|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|pitiful:  didn't cash their @s|pg||
nt|tomi2:  as predicted Italy won 3NT over there, dubion exited with a spade and had tempo to try the clubs because he knew the @S split|pg||
nt|j li: Smirnov hat über einenCriss-Cross-Squeeze erfüllt!|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|pitiful:  11 now|pg||
nt|psridhar: Bulagria leading italy 33-25 with one Bd o go|pg||

pc|dA|nt|rigas_karo: @s cannot go anywhere|pg||
nt|ady: Israel got 11 on board 12  where they could take all the hearts and ace of spades in 3NT|pg||
nt|babs59: the @DJ will be promoted here anyway - or the @D7 even|pg||
nt|riccho: wow|pg||
pc|d3|nt|jameslee 2: that,s good headlines news good job Padma |pg||

nt|riccho: sehr cool|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Italy vs Israel, Poland v Germany in the last round|pg||
nt|barnets: when west is min he bids 3@C|pg||
pc|d5|nt|petergill: Might be an imp to Sweden here|pg||

nt|barnets: and east can play the hand|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A match like this is particularly imprtant because both nations will advance to the finals. VPs against the eight other qualifiers are carried forward|pg||

pc|c4|pg||
nt|ftpe: cant be rigth|pg||
