nt|chick: a good example of why you should preempt (2N for minors) and then let partner make the rest of the decisions|pg||
nt|8252: on rappelle le contexte : les 9 premiers sont qualifiés, chaque équipe conserve au tour suivant les points obtenus contre les 8 autres qualifiés|pg||

nt|oleberg: Everything is bad-placed for NS, if they can manege to penalty double, 300 should be available|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: & there is te suit|pg||
nt|oleberg: They do play the first double (after the initial) as takeout|pg||

nt|skaftij:  unbeatable|pg||
nt|suketbombi: just started yes 5@H is doomed due to lack of entries but a good VUl save|pg||
nt|athene: are they really playing this fast?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: England bowling quite well at the minute|pg||
mb|3D|nt|yuval10: N in the OR also opened 1@h |pg||
nt|ralfwil: I think it´s a she Mike|pg||
nt|odysseus69: trump lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|yannis3012: begining with a difficult 3nt to make|pg||
nt|star6ija: 17-18 direct 1 N, 19-20 via 1h|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: well they scaped from that one |pg||
nt|ralfwil: the only positive for ns is that it´s undoubled|pg||
nt|oleberg: 3 down could be possible, but requires accurate defence|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: all the key cards are badly placed K@H,K@S,AQ@C|pg||
nt|riccho: 11-13 SA bei Gro und Andreas|pg||
mb|3N|nt|peachy: EW system is 4-card majors, light style 14-16 and 15-17NT. NS is Transfer Walsh 15-17NT|pg||
nt|athene: tricky hand to play - ruffing diamond finesse is a possibility|pg||
nt|bagman: There are lot's of high cards out and E passed and W opened weak|pg||
nt|athene: the problem is that ruffing diamond finesse might not be that useful, even if the king is with east|pg||
nt|athene: because if the @DQ is covered you have to use the @CA to get back there for a fast pitch of the heart|pg||
nt|athene: and that gives up on a double club finesse|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer wants a quick discards and wants to play the clubs for one loser|pg||
nt|athene: it's possible he might put all his eggs in one basket and take a normal diamond finesse; i.e. lead to the queen|pg||
nt|bagman: W  has shown up with @HKQ, does he have @DK and @CH?|pg||
nt|athene: the other issue is, you aren't necessarily going all-out to make|pg||
nt|athene: if it risks incurring two or three additional vulnerable undertricks|pg||
nt|bagman: S vulnerable he needs to make as many tricks as possible unless he has 9 safe|pg||
nt|bagman: He has likely 3 spade losers and a club|pg||
nt|athene: not at all an easy decision for south here|pg||
nt|athene: i prefer to open these hands 2@S first time|pg||
nt|athene: passing might appear safer but you often end up having to take more of a risk later at a higher level|pg||
nt|bagman: If he takes the straight diamond finesse, he needs to play @S to the Q|pg||
nt|athene: he knows the points are split fairly evenly between east and west|pg||
nt|bagman: Hoping for Jx KQxxx Kxx Qx or similar leaving E AKx xx xxx Kxx|pg||
nt|athene: west has weak-2 and east can't open - that doesn't leave much room for variation, with 21 hcp missing|pg||
nt|athene: the only problem is, there are a lot of variations in which cards each defender has|pg||
nt|bagman: If he places KQ of hearts and @DK west, he is quite restricted to place the rest for a make|pg||
nt|andreasw:  only lead is @S if u dont want to give any trick's|pg||
nt|haans: South do not liked it|pg||
nt|othered1: hi!|pg||
nt|lesniak: teraz musza zmienic na kiera|pg||
nt|pikonlu: su anda 11. durumdayýz|pg||
nt|athene: maybe they want to get finished early so they can watch murray-nadal :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lmeili: 4N shows 6 4?|pg||
nt|ziff:  Looks like the par contract|pg||
nt|yuval10: so no swing in a rather dangerous board |pg||
nt|yuval10: Israeli open for instance opened 1@c and played it wrong-sidedly, going down 1|pg||
nt|aldek: it can be made, but unlikely|pg||
nt|cameron_1: yes|pg||
nt|mdgraham: looking at the banner, you can be dead certain|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the W is a clue|pg||
nt|udo: naja, 1-3 SA wär auch mal was neues|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: another thinnish game reached|pg||

nt|haans: Hi Barry wlc|pg||
nt|poohbear: sorry|pg||
nt|poohbear: dont mean to chat|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: hi barry|pg||
nt|udo: 4 @H fails , even finding @H Queen doubleton is not enough|pg||
nt|udo: no entries for the 2 top-spades for diamond discards|pg||
nt|brolucius: East expects six hearts for a 2@H rebid that bypasses so many alternative rebid. Hence the raise.|pg||
nt|udo: hm, only 2 clublooses|pg||
nt|udo: losers|pg||
nt|othered1: with @CJ on, this does make (6@H, 2@S, 1@D, 1@C)|pg||
nt|udo: small @H to jack will be enough|pg||
nt|othered1: or win in dummy, pitch @C, hook rounded suits|pg||
nt|othered1: sorry, pitch @D|pg||
nt|udo: or 2 discards after heart to the jack|pg||
nt|othered1: (Ignore me, I'll awaken shortly)|pg||
nt|udo: jack of clubs is the important card, and it is well placed|pg||
nt|udo: same here:)|pg||
nt|udo: good morning ED:)|pg||
nt|tomi2:  I think they should not have bid that game, IMO east should have passed 2@H|pg||
nt|brolucius: At last I have managed to find a Lauria-Versace convention card. The 2NT response on Board 1 was a limit bid in partner's major. More often nowadays, 2NT shows a game-forcing ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: raise.|pg||
nt|8252: les 2 derniers matche sdes français comptent donc double, puisque Bulgare et allemands seront au tour suivant|pg||
nt|ralfwil: except @dK:)|pg||
nt|oleberg: A switch to the @DQ is the first step towards -3|pg||
nt|oleberg: And it must beducked|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Operator, please insert player names|pg||
mb|p|nt|andreasw:  u can also selved @d self but would problebly go wrong|pg||

pc|hK|nt|andersk: a push now, 1 NT RD would been interesting|pg||
nt|andreasw:  solved|pg||
nt|odysseus69: may manage 2 down|pg||
nt|bagman: NS might make a partscore here but with xxx in diamonds neither player is willing to compete|pg||
nt|mdgraham: both pairs pretty natural; 5-card majors, strong NT|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: on the other room hand 1 the lead was a small @S in 4@H |pg||

nt|davidb: S should play cl  to defeat|pg||
nt|ady: might beat it now with a club switch|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer seeks an entry with the @HJ.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We have something for the history books after this mornings round. Italy has lost back-to-back matches! No-one can remember when that last happened. Los 10-20 to Hungary last night ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and 14-16 against Hungary today|pg||
nt|tomi2:  was his intention to duck the 10 or overtake?|pg||
nt|othered1: EW system is described as Swiss-ACOL.   I'm not sure how limited the 2@H bid was.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Duck, I expect, to set up the @HJ (or avoid losing a trump trick). Unlikely that they would duck @HQ - but possible at this level.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We got the names right now, thank you operator|pg||
nt|riccho: Die 1" klemmt bei mir manchmal... :(|pg||
pc|dA|nt|yannis3012: hi ntino|pg||

nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|bagman: If he places the @DK east, he has probably some better chances to make|pg||
nt|brolucius: Now declarer can ditch his diamonds.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We can't expect her/him to have the  ö  on the keyboard|pg||
nt|mdgraham: would it be possible to have the player names please operator? |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: well a bit of air for North|pg||

pc|dK|nt|yannis3012: evrything is in, so 3nt is cold|pg||
nt|eweber: it seems we didn't miss too much by starting a bit late here|pg||
nt|aldek: however south did not enter the bidding over 1@D with some cards in the majors,|pg||
nt|bagman: 1NT opening at this vulnerability was 9-12|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Souths aces perhaps justify the flexible double, but the long and tight hearts favour bidding on. Tough decision |pg||
pc|d3|nt|haans: close to error|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Italy's match this morning was against Bulgaria. Sorry for mentioning Hungary twice|pg||
nt|f_aydogdu: kotü 3nt 4sp iyi kontrat salvonun eliyle 4sp derdim|pg||
nt|athene: some might play leaping michaels over the multi, so 4@C = clubs +major|pg||
pc|s6|nt|rigas_karo: +1 now|pg||
nt|Walddk12: Operator, a couple of typos in North's name   Haraldsson|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We have about 19 pedants in the audience|pg||

nt|skaftij:  Israel in 7@d on bd 1|pg||

nt|Walddk2: I don't expect the operator to have the  Ø  on his keyboard, no big deal. JORGENSEN is fine|pg||
nt|Walddk2: N-S play 5443 with a strong NT|pg||
nt|psridhar: spd back instead of that h will lead to a dummy lock temporarily, but decl might still make|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5 spades, 4 hearts, 4 diamonds and 3 clubs (only 3 when 4333 specifically)|pg||
nt|brolucius: An early chance for Israel, then. Not easy hands to bid, once the old-fashioned jump shift is dismissed from the scene. |pg||

mb|p|nt|h_karluk: pre vs pre + un vs un are useful toys|pg||

nt|ady: much better with west declarer|pg||
nt|athene: they aren't missing any keycards - it might be hard to see|pg||

mb|3N|nt|bagman: good for them as the heart finesse is off|pg||

pc|h2|pg||
nt|pikolo: konserwatywny to tylko Adam :)|pg||
nt|bagman: With heart lead the contract would have gone down in quite natural manner declarer not having time to establish diamonds|pg||
nt|suketbombi: mat:)|pg||
nt|davidb: Swhartz -sheinman in the Seniors play 1Cl- 2D strong -may reach |pg||
nt|yuval10: 10 tricks likely|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Israel will know that they need 25- a tall order but will suggest an aggressive approach|pg||
nt|brolucius: East is happy to play game, facing a vulnerable opening, with his fitting diamond honours.|pg||
nt|brolucius: I don't expect Israel will go mad. Better to secure the brightest medal that is within practical reach.|pg||
nt|davidb: I agree . The chance of 25 vs Italy .... |pg||
nt|brolucius: North can guess the heart position after East's jump to 3NT.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No matter what happens, both teams qualify for next year's Bermuda Bowl in the Netherlands|pg||
nt|odysseus69: they have a big lead over 4th - 14.5 I think so only a heavy defeat might lose bronze - I think they should look ffor the miracle|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Top 6 + Netherlands if they are not among the 6. If they are, a seventh qualifies|pg||
nt|brolucius: Netherlands are currently 6th. Whether a 7th ream will go through depends on whether the Netherlands (the BB hosts) qualify by right.|pg||
nt|brolucius: No weaponry known to mankind can defeat 3NT on this board.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And Top 10 qualify for the European Champions' Cup in Turkey|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Netherlands looking good now after a recent surge into 5th |pg||
nt|yuval10: Russia is having a healthy lead over Bulgaria for the precious 7th place|pg||
nt|yuval10: same contract in the OR , 3NT|pg||
nt|yuval10: for board 2, that is|pg||
nt|brolucius: At this rate, per trick, they will consume most of the session on this board.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: North knows that South has all the missing high cards - best hope is only AK doubleton diamond|pg||
pc|h3|nt|Gerben42: Netherlands had a bad start vs Ireland, whereas Russia started with a small win vs Sweden, a competitor for a Bermuda Bowl spot|pg||
nt|shevek: Wales is running 6th|pg||
nt|MolvaM: seems many norths could just blast 4@s after hearing pd open a weak 2 here|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: should go off even with the @c lead|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: S is trying to make @S tricks problem no direct entry time for E-W to make @H good|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: still double stopper helps him to make contract |pg||
nt|odysseus69: difficult to keep oppo out of bidding- |pg||
nt|suketbombi: may:)|pg||
pc|h9|nt|haans: 5@H risky|pg||
nt|xenya: @SA followed by @SK and another spade would have defeated it -- previous hand |pg||
nt|bagman: Now the defense has started to attack declarer's long suits|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes both of them. But obvious to dbl 2 @h??|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Bd 2 E open room|pg||
nt|skaftij:  West 5@s|pg||
nt|skaftij:  South 6@h!!|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Dbl by east|pg||
nt|skaftij:  so Israel will gain 3 imps only|pg||
nt|suketbombi: so that is clear 500 3 imps to israel|pg||
nt|brolucius: Since there are only 12 points in the closed hands, North cannot hope for anything much with South. |pg||
pc|h7|nt|lmeili: when @d QJ does'nt fall, still the chance @h 3-3 or Tx, and @c K on side|pg||
nt|bagman: It needs the heart finesse|pg||
nt|aap00: 1@c = strong, 1@s = looks like "bal GF", some relays|pg||
nt|ftpe: yes|pg||
nt|haans: few entries to dummy|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: getting worse after K@H|pg||
nt|haans: well only non vul|pg||
nt|brolucius: Only 1 IMP to Germany for the fancy play in 4@H. Semanta advanced with 2NT on the East cards, after the same start, and 3NT was bid and made.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: guys, was that a hidden camera joke? I meant 2nd trick a low spade towards dummy|pg||
nt|andersk: Or @C|pg||
nt|lesh: if the king of spades is 3rd in East, he needs A@h to be in West|pg||
nt|lesh: the small spade makes no sense|pg||
nt|h_karluk: I think today is Monday June 28, 2010, so obviously not April one, whatever|pg||
nt|justin c: if South's double was penalty, no reason for N to remove it that I can see|pg||
nt|babs59: isn't it now 18-19 based on inflation?|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|aap00: playing @dQ, not 10 correct - you can discard 3d @d by @c|pg||

nt|ralfwil: That´s what I ment about Dbl after 2@h from E. 3-card support|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Brazil out- Holland through|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2 spades, 3 diamonds and 1 club. Curtains|pg||
nt|odysseus69: and heart 9 with pd|pg||
pc|dA|nt|shevek: maybe they shouldn't be so keen not vul|pg||
nt|ftpe: declarer knows who has king he know|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 1nt+1 could be the end of te hand |pg||
nt|ralfwil: ???? is this correct?|pg||
nt|bagman: But not any more|pg||
pc|d6|nt|motu: what about restriced choise|pg||
nt|mcarroll: S looking for N's entry for a @D ruff|pg||
nt|haans: many austrians have played Blue Clubs for 30 years|pg||
nt|MolvaM: specs tell me 3@s shows a no-singleton hand and a bad-bad hand|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: true|pg||
nt|bagman: With 4 spades and a heart it is enough to score only 4 tricks in the minors|pg||
nt|bagman: As both are 33 declarer can pick either|pg||
pc|d2|nt|santyclz: Certainly rates to be a much quicker hand in @cs than @ss.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Now has the problem of guessing the trumps to make 5|pg||
nt|aap00: thk no real chance to go wrong|pg||
nt|ftpe: he will win for sure, but migth take some time :)|pg||
nt|xenya: no -- he will play for @SKxx in the W hand|pg||
nt|bagman: North is silently cursing now as he knows that partner had 3 hearts|pg||
nt|idc: interesting shot leading the @d, perhaps to try to steal a trick and make NS think he was strong in @d|pg||
nt|idc: But I'm still not sure I can recommend it|pg||
nt|idc: sorry, brain not working yet|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|bagman: Now comes the @CJ |pg||

nt|antoniz: farcik jest:)|pg||
nt|lechcold: mniam:)|pg||
nt|snetram:  zabawne|pg||
nt|mdgraham: NS strong club, variable NT; EW 5M, weak NT, 1@C may be weak NT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: first blood to Sweden on board 1 - the Swedish EW made 6@s|pg||
nt|odysseus69: cant get to 3NT now- |pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@D looks to be to play opposite a weak two in diamonds - however one suspects a crossed wire|pg||
nt|yusufb: 30 yas civarý sanýrým|pg||
nt|psridhar: these days the one opening is not given due respect; if u want an example look at the danish opening on Bd 2 in other room|pg||
nt|idc: And too good as well - looks like a 2@h bid, possibly followed by an invite to 3@s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If you belong in game, you will get there after 2@H. When North signs off in 2@S, you have done enough in my opinion|pg||
mb|p|nt|andersk: I beleve 2 @C is drury with 3 card|pg||
nt|aap00: no cards for 6 |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 2@S shape & points |pg||
nt|justin c: as a passed hand, West might have stretched to 2@D |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: first duck from declarer to open comunication |pg||
nt|oleberg: Declarer will probaly try to "scramble"; getting his small thrumphs home|pg||
nt|ozgull: yani adamlar 27-28 yaþlarýnda|pg||
pc|h7|nt|eweber: and of those 10 teams 6+NL will play in the Bermuda Bowl|pg||
nt|andersk: Has to switch @D or @C noe, I predeict @D|pg||
nt|ady: this needed a major suit lead |pg||
nt|kdr_fm: nothing breaking (well @C 5/4) this is going off a few|pg||
nt|oleberg: Instead of trying to drawthrumphs, and control the hand|pg||
nt|odysseus69: no|pg||
nt|athene: defence just have to get their spades going|pg||
nt|athene: but it won't be hard to attack spades, seeing that dummy|pg||
nt|odysseus69: wont be difficult|pg||
nt|odysseus69: with Q9x diamond and a king I prefer pass-|pg||
pc|h5|nt|bagman: quiet lookin partial, declarer probably making 9 tricks|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 3@H  6 card |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 4@H end |pg||
nt|lesh: unfortunately for E/W 4@s is making|pg||
nt|barnets: 5@D would be a good save down just 1|pg||
nt|brolucius: The doubletons in spades, also the vulnerability, are a deterrent.|pg||
nt|bagman: The defense has 4 tricks but they have not the means to take them (3 clubs and a heart)|pg||
nt|brolucius: The 2-2 spade break will now be helpful to declarer, providing an entry to the long hearts.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Murray lost first set|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer ruffs this, draws two rounds of trumps with QJ and starts hearts|pg||
nt|babs59: strange lead v. 4@C??|pg||
nt|odysseus69: and a strange lead-cant believe it|pg||
nt|athene: there's the principle of the obvious shift - and the principle of the blindingly obvious shift :)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|yuval10: did well here, and in the OR as well|pg||
nt|MolvaM: running scores http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/runningscores/asp/roundteamsconditstatclassicmod.asp?qtournid=819&qshowflag=1|pg||
nt|MolvaM: norths 2@c could be the gazilli convention that several pairs play these days|pg||
nt|MolvaM: showing either a natural @c rebid or some sort of strong hand|pg||
nt|ftpe: hearts 5-2, so only 5 spades here|pg||
nt|aap00: so 4 is reasonable contract|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer has some sort of chance to ditch a diamond on one of the black suits. A diamond finesse and a heart break would then give him a chance.|pg||
nt|brolucius: South's signal on the top-club lead deterred Lauria from cashing his other high club, thereby giving declarer a diamond discard. Buit the @DK is wrong anyway.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Vladimir was in Warsaw Poland in 2006 and in Antalya 2007 with reasonable ranking, however this time surprised to his line|pg||

nt|xenya: yes, 11 tricks|pg||
nt|davidb: both bids are ok for me |pg||
pc|c9|nt|andreasw:  yes.. 10 tricks next board:p|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer has 10 top tricks and 3 losers with no discards|pg||
nt|bagman: He has tested spades; not 5-0, claim time|pg||
nt|andreasw:  right!|pg||
nt|bagman: There is no way that defense would NOT play hearts, if he tries diamond to 9|pg||
nt|athene: east decides that diamonds are the most likely trick source for his side|pg||
nt|jkotor: why K@h automatic?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: great start for Italy|pg||
pc|c2|nt|eweber: o.k., sorry|pg||
nt|davidb: good stop as 3NT -only 8 tricks|pg||
nt|santyclz: 6 imps to France on board 2 for going + in both rooms.  |pg||
nt|othered1: it's difficult to stay out of this game, unless west opens strong NT and east chooses not to act, vulnerable.|pg||
nt|lesh: should take much longer before claiming|pg||
nt|andersk: Kinda stragne 2 @C and 4@H bid from Charlie here, I would prefeer 4@H over 1 @H opening, isnt that what the hand is wurth?|pg||
nt|lesh: certainly 4@H would do the job. I dont think North would dbl|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this might make, or it might go down - that covers most possibilities |pg||
nt|mdgraham: but should make now, even if NS get a spade ruff, as a diamond can be discarded on @CK|pg||
nt|ralfwil: walter the valrus had made this easy - double with a voice of thunder - (Mollo)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Please no cricket scores on the screen, since I am recording it.|pg||
nt|babs59: is the contract really 4@C?|pg||
nt|jkotor: .|pg||
pc|c3|nt|andersk: agree|pg||
nt|ftpe: he now|pg||
nt|aap00: in brd 2 W(!) pushed to 3nt... |pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|h_karluk: declarer for sure would try long string|pg||
nt|haans: the more @D he plays the better defense|pg||
nt|h_karluk: we will see |pg||
nt|brolucius: South does not waste a heart honor because he can tell that West will hold a bare honor (from North's choice of lead).|pg||
nt|brolucius: If West held a low singleton, he would win with dummy's ace, of course.|pg||
pc|s6|nt|andersk: 990 now|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Will make now. If S tries to get a @s ruff a @d will disapperar on @cK and if NS takes their @d tricks, no communication|pg||
nt|ady: diamond back|pg||
nt|suketbombi: ye @D back is the best defence tho but @H ( is also good at this satge|pg||
nt|suketbombi: @H9|pg||
pc|s4|nt|chick: bypassing drury may have some kind of subtle implication about strength|pg||
pc|s3|nt|Gerben42: changed from last time and will change again next time I guess|pg||
nt|andreasw:  3nt 11 trick's finessing @d|pg||
nt|othered1: i.e, it's a game virtually everyone will get to|pg||
nt|mdgraham: perhaps the real contract is 3NT|pg||
nt|ady: east cant be sure    but 9@H ok    |pg||
nt|psridhar: i think a jump cue 3H over 1s x -showing a 4 trump , invitnal raise is ok|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|athene: lauria's negative double over 2@D warned south off getting involved with his spade suit|pg||
nt|oleberg: Then again, he might not :)|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: bad news has arrived from the trumps|pg||
nt|oleberg: Nridge is easier, when you can see all four hands|pg||
nt|tokay1975: now easy 11|pg||
pc|hA|nt|aap00: for me strange, with 10hcp and passed pd |pg||
nt|haans: not easy clubs finesse|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|lmeili: if S ducks @dA|pg||
nt|bagman: I would guess that declarer discards a club on the hearts and gives 2 spades and 2 hearts|pg||
nt|athene: Sementa is prepared to lose his @HK to hold declarer to one heart winner rather than two|pg||
nt|bagman: Sementa's duck gives defense 3 spades instead of 2 spades|pg||
nt|brolucius: A high spot-card (@C7) is discouraging, against both suit and NT contracts. (Reverse attitude).|pg||
nt|justin c: leaving the @C suit blocked to keep entry to @HQJ|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a @s lead was defeating|pg||
nt|jkotor: polish or english comment here?|pg||
nt|psridhar: tho it leads to a minus here|pg||
pc|d3|nt|mcarroll: I agree - lets the defence signal very comfortably|pg||
nt|h_karluk: the only possibility to make this a thrown-in play with misdefense of West|pg||
nt|aap00: so, "well deserved" -5 impls|pg||
nt|yusufb: turkish|pg||
nt|pikonlu: turkish|pg||
nt|jkotor: oh|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|haans: @H6 even|pg||
nt|odysseus69: I hate that 2C option - it just interferes with big hand with too little damage to oppo on weak hands|pg||
nt|j li: Schön den treffschnapper verhindert, aber einen zweiten Treffstich gibt es trotzdem nicht|pg||
pc|c6|nt|peachy: NS 1H opening might not be everybody's choice, but they play 4-card majors, light style|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: he will ruff a @H & open the clubs guess !|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer keeps the @SA as an entry in case he needs to finesse E for @HT|pg||
nt|suketbombi: he did not have @C count I think|pg||
pc|cA|nt|peachy: oops, he overcalled!|pg||
nt|ziff:  I must confess that I would not sell the E hand as 9+, but Entscho s judgement has always been somewhat different....|pg||
nt|h_karluk: pitch the spade and lose the board|pg||
nt|mdgraham: can you shed any light please operator?|pg||
pc|c4|nt|MolvaM: this is a 630 or 660 hand for the field to rest their grey cells|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Thor Erik was in San Remo 2009, i guess evil made him do that double|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|andersk: will probably go down|pg||
nt|oleberg: Well, a double with a voice of thunder might not have been good. It might make if nort's strength is known|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's frustrating to get overboard when you have good cards (South's)|pg||
pc|s8|nt|athene: he will carry on with the time-honoured antidote to a 4-4 trump fit - keep leading trumps|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer can play N to have AQx and make now 10 tricks|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|peachy: ignore everything I said, please :)|pg||
nt|bagman: Or W can let N to have @SQ|pg||
nt|athene: declarer probably thinks the club is offside|pg||
nt|athene: he will try and endplay north|pg||
nt|athene: duck another spade now, perhaps|pg||
nt|bagman: The @C-finesse working is an extra bonus|pg||
nt|andersk: maybe, I cant see what damage ¤@H direct might couse|pg||
pc|s9|nt|xenya: i'm told there are no commentators in the open room, so I think i'll switch over there|pg||
nt|ftpe: now he plays safe|pg||
nt|aap00: oh, yes me too |pg||
nt|kdr_fm: W praying that @dT9 .... arghhh :>|pg||
nt|barnets: perhaps the hackets will bid 5@D they like to bid|pg||
nt|babs59: I dislike mixing strong bids and weak bids... as with the multi 2@D having a strong option.  That also hinders the preemptive nature of the 2@D multi |pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|haans: they do not show count|pg||
nt|andersk: Time to give @c count for East now|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cK|nt|haans: @DK must be cover both other suits|pg||
nt|andreasw:  now take @d finesse|pg||
nt|aap00: thotught it's OR :) |pg||
pc|d2|nt|andersk: finally|pg||
nt|andreasw:  can't hurt|pg||
nt|aap00: bye |pg||
nt|h_karluk: +1|pg||
nt|lesh: well with 7points and 5th support, I dont think drury was very appropriate|pg||
nt|h_karluk: S4SX+1|pg||
nt|justin c: many off now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Because then the opponents can't make anything|pg||
nt|idc: I like to use that for mixed raises: a hand between a preempt and a cue bid of opps suit|pg||
nt|psridhar: accurately defended for 200|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
pc|d6|nt|justin c: @D9, north pitches blocking @CJ|pg||
nt|yuval10: 2NT by S OR|pg||
nt|brolucius: The defenders did well, removing dummy's trumps, and will now collect their reward.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: so 1 down |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|peachy: best to get a diam out now|pg||
nt|h_karluk: not abt @c count|pg||
nt|haans: most swedes 8 = odd |pg||

pc|dA|nt|shevek: in bd 2 (the mirror hand) Iceland gained 12 imps|pg||

pc|d7|nt|athene: ok well done|pg||
nt|odysseus69: potential swing for Israel|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|mcarroll: Obviously listening to you Anders :)|pg||
nt|andersk: abot time:)|pg||
nt|andersk: about|pg||
nt|h_karluk: then declarer wld be a @h less and a @c more|pg||
nt|h_karluk: as @c K favorably placed always makes, west doesn't need to care signals|pg||
nt|h_karluk: just count it out more and make fine judgement|pg||
nt|andreasw:  claim|pg||
nt|udo: would be down now, even with !J diamond in the finesse?|pg||

nt|shevek: coffee hand, brb :)|pg||
nt|jkotor: operator, do we know 3@c meaning?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but will S be quiet?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Quite common to play that two of a major via Stayman is invitational now. That restricts the option of bidding 2@C on South's shape.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: some advocate Stayman with 4-4 knowing at least a 4-3 fit - would not have been good idea here|pg||
nt|bagman: South has enough to be dummy in NT; no need to look for an 'escape'|pg||
nt|barnets: does not look north is destined for success here|pg||
nt|yuval10: 18-19 NT i guess|pg||
nt|dburn: this is 18-19 balanced|pg||
mb|3D|nt|eweber: 2@c precision style again|pg||
nt|lmeili: looks like 12 tricks in NT|pg||
nt|cameron_1: seems trange|pg||
nt|mamos: prsumably majors|pg||
nt|mamos: and or values   "competitive"|pg||
nt|cameron_1: i was referign to David's initial choice of 2@c rather than X|pg||
nt|mamos: from an english poerspective these Queens all look to be in the wrong places  opponents hands rather than theirs|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: no he stayed still Vul danger|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but use it moderate , 10 goodish or minimum 11 required|pg||
nt|snetram:  a ja 4pik z kontrÄ|pg||
nt|aldek: kara piki|pg||
nt|justin c: this is a nice 6@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|jameslee 2: other room 2@S but by North is being played |pg||
nt|barnets: england hit the front 5-0|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2@D 18-19 (occasionally 20) balanced.|pg||
mb|3S|nt|haans: lavinthal|pg||
nt|yuval10: 4@h here is actually easier, but 4@s will prevail, too|pg||
nt|yuval10: in 4@h you can discard 2@s's over the KQ@c|pg||
nt|tomi2:  do you play 1@S as 5 cards here?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: iceland lies at the top of the table with 2 more days to go|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 1 more match today and 6 matches the next days|pg||
nt|MolvaM: top 9 ranked teams will qualify for the second stage|pg||
nt|MolvaM: then teams will play a round robin with the teams coming from the other group|pg||
nt|ftpe: south is looking for 6 spades, but cant win here|pg||
nt|haans: 3@C full of danger|pg||
nt|haans: 2@D may have been trf|pg||
nt|haans: more logical|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: not in this position |pg||
nt|haans: but bidding @D twice is?|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: but one never knows in this game |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: what a parnership can bild up |pg||
nt|psridhar: Hi all|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: big think there by N |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: hi |pg||
nt|haans: only 40 hcp exist|pg||
nt|psridhar: two high class pairs facing each other -should be an absorbing contest|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 5@D can be made true will see where he ends up|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes only way to make 5@H there|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Dbl by North shows 3@hs|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: but for the @S finesse had a good chance to make it.|pg||
nt|roswolf: never likely to be bid though|pg||
nt|brolucius: You see how light South's 2@S response is. Everyone does that nowadays, to allow partner to compete if he has extra trump-length. In the Bad Old Days, a raise to 2@S was considered ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: a 'free bid' (particularly in the USA) and promised a king's ransom.|pg||
nt|udo: and 4 @S NS  |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 3@D= bergen |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 4@S = 10/11 tricks |pg||
nt|j li: Mir gefällt 3SA statt 4@H|pg||
nt|riccho: Würde jeder 3@h auf 2@s reizen hier? |pg||
nt|psridhar: no drury avoiding the 3 level on a 8 card fit ?|pg||
nt|idc: Roland, which Schaltz is that in OR?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Fancy stuff like Drury is not on the CC it appears|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Peter|pg||
mb|3N|nt|Gerben42: if thats not a minimum hand I never saw one|pg||
nt|davidb: normal  450 . will be flat all over I believe|pg||
nt|haans: yes both both clear for second rr|pg||
nt|brolucius: Italy has reached game on 4, I am told.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: dont agree about multi - its just which strong options are included - |pg||
nt|odysseus69: Mexican 2D - 18-20 balanced|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: Lebensohl|pg||
nt|andersk: must be the best weak 2 ever|pg||
nt|yuval10: 4+|pg||
nt|tomi2:  Hackett raised to 3@S with only 3 cad support. I play a cuebid by overcaller as 3 card support raise with maximum here, so 3@S would always be 4 cards for me|pg||
nt|yuval10: seem like a nice agreement|pg||
nt|yuval10: you have to play over the @h's in 4@s|pg||
nt|yuval10: Alfredo Versace is going down in 4@s in his match|pg||
nt|udo: 4@H is ok played from W|pg||
nt|aldek: ghestem|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: kiedy Rumiñski objasnia³ rêkê swojego partnera który otworzy³ 1 karo 0-7..."partner ma bardzo silna rêk¹" ...jak to jak jest slaby? Ma bardzo siln¹ rêkê w ramach swojego otwarcia|pg||

nt|ady: 3@S  a good part score save|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: yepsry|pg||
nt|yuval10: means that this contract isn't so easy |pg||
nt|mamos: this all looks odd|pg||
nt|MolvaM: while the results from their own group will be carried over|pg||
nt|xenya: well if N just had @HA instead of the King... |pg||
nt|lesh: 2@c prec, 2@s non forcing.However South has a decent hand he tried 4@s|pg||
nt|lesh: it also put pressure on the oppoinents and they might as here bid 5@d|pg||
nt|snetram:  moÅ¼e byÄ imponujacy wyÅcig, ale nie musi|pg||
nt|jkotor: E bêdzie musia³ nadbijaæ kara|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: Assuming 4@d shows a good 4@s bid maybe with 3 trumps and 4 iron clad tricks N is worth a 4@h Slam try ...|pg||
nt|barnets: a zia play play your wekest suit|pg||
nt|barnets: weakest|pg||
nt|bagman: With diamond lead, 4@H would have been near impossible. 3NT requires now the hearts to provide 5 tricks|pg||
nt|udo: passen kommt nicht in Frage, für mich|pg||
nt|idc: Thanks|pg||
mb|p|nt|eweber: 2NT was nat, nf|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I would open 1 @S with that hand|pg||
nt|ady: apart from spades behaving  would need to guess diamond rightr   a poor slam|pg||
nt|Walddk1: http://tinyurl.com/ebc-open-b   http://tinyurl.com/ebc-open-a   http://tinyurl.com/3yl8spu  for running Euro scores |pg||
nt|andersk: might settle for -1 here, If @S lead, @H lead -2|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: Armstrong or Contador?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I vote for 12|pg||
nt|ady: unlikely to be doubled   so just -50|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Must be it since 4 said it now|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|peachy: with trumps not splitting, this will be tough to play, unless of course EW bids again (I doubt it)|pg||
nt|wygbe1: 6d is pretty  good, but the cards are not friendly|pg||
nt|lmeili: 3@c says 9+ red cards not min hand|pg||
nt|lmeili: tx Rado, 3@s may show sington @c|pg||
nt|tomi2:  what would you lead here?|pg||
nt|lmeili: probably @d, not @s not @h not @c|pg||
nt|tomi2:   seems to cause communication problems, but I cant Imagine to lead a @D from jxx|pg||
nt|motu: i guess i would lead a@H|pg||
nt|tomi2:  seems like a good idea too, in case S has also a singleton you cut this communication|pg||
nt|ziff:  I hope for a @D (obviously), but would lead a @H myself|pg||
nt|motu: with 3@C showing 9 red cards a @D lead looks unatraktiv for me|pg||
nt|haans: Blue Clubs with 5-c M|pg||
nt|cameron_1: I guess Tom chickened out and assumed David was under pressure picking a short major, even so|pg||
nt|ftpe: rigth|pg||
nt|ftpe: 3 spade is probably min and 3-carder in sp|pg||
nt|haans: holy ...|pg||
nt|udo: 4@S NS is beatable NS, but only with the unlikely @D lead|pg||
nt|bagman: Attacking his weakest suit hoping the defense plays one of the stronger|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Italy got hearts in first in Open Room and reached 4 hearts|pg||
nt|athene: vicious defensive crossruff in the majors is coming very shortly|pg||
nt|barnets: only 50 a trick|pg||
nt|brolucius: No more takers?|pg||
nt|yuval10: tricky hand here|pg||
nt|dburn: and 3@c is puppet Stayman of some kind, I think|pg||
nt|brolucius: Standard puppet Stayman sequence with West showing hearts.|pg||

pc|h2|nt|lmeili: he hears |pg||

nt|cameron_1: rather than X|pg||

nt|jameslee 2: we have in this days so many bergen types all bettween 0-11 points with 3 or 4 card support |pg||
nt|brolucius: Gold will try to look worried if they switch to diamonds at some stage.|pg||
nt|babs59: It's just my opinion, and I don't like 2@C having the GF and weak option, similarly|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes curiouly if 3 rounds of @Hs ate played declerer will end up making 3@S but no chance here|pg||
nt|suketbombi: opening lead 3 rounds of @H|pg||
nt|ady: why would it make with 3 rounds of hearts|pg||
nt|riccho: Ja sicher. W hätte ja noch KJxx haben können|pg||
nt|riccho: Ich finde 3@h jdf. auch nicht als ungefährlich|pg||
nt|psridhar: if the defense picks up the h ruff now they will repeat their 200 acquisition now|pg||
nt|idc: I see the Italians take the view that CC info is to some extent voluntary :)|pg||
nt|idc: one pair doesn't seem to have one|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Peter Schaltz has played more than 500 internationals for the open team. So the fact that he has now joined the seniors makes that team stronger|pg||
nt|psridhar: it is certainly sub-optimal to be forced to raise to 3s on that N hand|pg||
nt|psridhar: even assuming the 3rd seat opening is not mischievous|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Berg is a naturalist. He is not a fan of too many gadgets|pg||
nt|dburn: 3@d some major, 3@s four hearts, etc|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|peachy: I dont think even 5 makes|pg||
nt|peachy: but 5 Is certainly reasonable bid, |pg||
nt|andreasw:  and endplay is up|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: there we go 5@D X all |pg||
nt|h_karluk: 5@d likely doubled off three, unless @cK works in some way|pg||
pc|d3|nt|brolucius: South can visualize a club ruff after the E/W club bidding.|pg||
nt|andersk: even better to get 200|pg||
nt|chick: turning a small plus into a big minus :(|pg||
pc|d6|nt|haans: good opening VUL|pg||
nt|andersk: I open 2 @S, but my openings are 9-13|pg||
nt|MolvaM: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/runningscores/asp/roundteamsconditstatclassicmod.asp?qtournid=819&qshowflag=1|pg||
nt|psridhar: If north had raised diamonds at his first turn -3d over 2S- he would have avoided bidding at 4 level on his own , like he did here|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: the card play to position of the AQ@H guess|pg||
nt|tomi2:  Lauria cold pitch the @HQ|pg||
nt|tomi2:  @SQ|pg||
nt|andersk: 500|pg||
nt|andersk: sorry|pg||
nt|lesh: well 5@s isnt the best call|pg||
nt|aldek: jako junior Bas Drijver byl bardzo ostroznym graczem|pg||
pc|dK|nt|Gerben42: Rudakov removed because of the @S problem, not because of his good suit|pg||
nt|wygbe1: play off 3 top clubs pitching h's and let e ruff|pg||
nt|peachy: declarer is likely to adopt that line, but then he has to deal with the H, S and club losers in hand|pg||
nt|peachy: might turn out too tuff|pg||
nt|wygbe1: yes, the line that works is to just ruff the 2 low clubs in dummy and draw trumps, finessing against d jack|pg||
nt|wygbe1: even that could run into difficulty|pg||
nt|h_karluk: oh yes, now i liked more Lawrence's Law of total tricks |pg||
nt|odysseus69: as a founder member of the multi society I suggest including only strong 4-4-4-1 hands as the only strong option|pg||
nt|odysseus69: will do well to find a way to 9 tricks here|pg||
nt|babs59: :)   I was referring to the strong 2NT option that gets included in Australia - which inhibits preempting in majors|pg||
nt|babs59: It will require Versace magic I feel|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|andersk: If not I open 1|pg||
nt|mdgraham: maybe @HK, heart ruff, @CA -  |pg||
nt|bagman: Bochi might place N with 4 carder in @H|pg||
nt|odysseus69: second club looks natural|pg||
nt|babs59: Russia is in 4@SX on board 3|pg||
nt|mdgraham: may play diamond to J and ace, and lead a diamond towards the South hand - finesse 9?|pg||
nt|bagman: Soon declarer plays a spade to the A and takes the heart finesse for his contract|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And Jørgensen forgets them anyway :)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|haans: dim 2-2 big plus|pg||
nt|haans: @HQ double right|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: he guess correctly seems like @D 2/2 helps sure does|pg||
nt|haans: 2nd opinion: ronsheffy: makes!!!|pg||
nt|tomi2:  so versace now could signal a spade in his ruff|pg||
nt|idc: and what could be more natural than a minus score?|pg||
nt|yuval10: he'll have to decide which opp to finnese the Q@c|pg||
pc|hA|nt|brolucius: An even discard (@D10) is discouraging in that suit.|pg||
nt|cumino: I doubt|pg||
nt|suketbombi: a diamond endplay but ok can give R&D so never makes|pg||
pc|h8|nt|andersk: yes|pg||
nt|peachy: In any case, they avoided the hopeless slam in this room.|pg||
nt|jkotor: a Sjoert zawsze gra³ ostro!|pg||
nt|odysseus69: cant release heart so D or S from dummy - doesnt want to throw either|pg||
nt|brolucius: West bids the major that he does not hold, so East (the strong hand) can become declarer if there is a 4-4 fit in the major.|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|Gerben42: the 4-1 break means that 2@S NS wont make either|pg||
nt|wygbe1: the slam is actually not bad with reasonable splits, but here the splits are not good|pg||
nt|chick: the Law of Total Tricks doesn't work very well above the 4 level|pg||

nt|justin c: might have chosen to cash the @SA before playing on @D here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: then South can't ruff a spade|pg||
nt|dburn: and if no major-suit fit is located, the defence has maximum information on which to conduct its business|pg||
nt|davidb: 9 tricks if Lauria believes the H count|pg||
nt|dburn: one of the worst conventions in the world, puppet Stayman - almost as bad as support doubles and leaping Michaels|pg||
nt|brolucius: However, all three conventions are immensely popular...|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ftpe: declarer playing safe using club ace, afraid off ruffs|pg||

nt|yuval10: and now for a goulash hand|pg||
nt|tomi2:  I think 1@C is 2+@C for the German pair|pg||
nt|bagman: In the late 80's  passing out a deal was nearly impossible|pg||
nt|athene: EW might be able to create some confusion|pg||
nt|athene: with 11 -card spade fit|pg||
nt|antoniz: odzyskujemy przewagê psychiczn¹:)|pg||

nt|ady: 6@H  e/w|pg||
nt|psridhar: 4 queens and 2 jacks made up the 21 hcp that NS held-they are overvalued in the hcp method|pg||
mb|1H|nt|Gerben42: weak 2 in @D|pg||
nt|Gerben42: refreshingly natural|pg||
nt|eweber: there is a tiny little chance of an endplay vs South|pg||
nt|wygbe1: guess i missed something, down 1 looked pretty easy|pg||
nt|yuval10: really hard to predict what the final outcome here will be|pg||
nt|tomi2:  am no fan of double and no fan of redouble here. what contract does Della Monta want to play doubled, iff ops bid it?|pg||
nt|yuval10: X from S is dangerous in the sense that sometimes P will pass and you have very few defensive tricks for him|pg||
nt|tomi2:  yes|pg||
nt|roswolf: another straightforward board|pg||
nt|bagman: p-p|pg||
nt|athene: 2@S must be a takeout |pg||
nt|bagman: S is confident in his methods|pg||
nt|athene: takeout of spades|pg||
nt|fokal: 2@d shows @s , strong or weak|pg||
nt|fokal: hi all by the way|pg||
nt|athene: maybe 2@S is specifically michaels|pg||
nt|bagman: Is it T/O or 2-suiter?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi.|pg||
nt|athene: many pairs play "leaping michaels" over these bids, so 4@D would be reds|pg||
nt|bagman: hi|pg||
nt|fokal: so I guess 2@s shows a two suiters for sure|pg||
nt|athene: maybe NS don't play that or maybe south prefers to treat his hand as a 3-suiter|pg||
nt|bagman: N has an easy raise of the q-bid :)|pg||
nt|bagman: if methods permit such treatment|pg||
nt|hawe45:  So - I was late from another match|pg||
nt|athene: north pretty much just wants to RKCB in hearts|pg||
nt|athene: but he might have to set hearts first|pg||
nt|MolvaM: double now?|pg||
nt|andreasw:  1@s and 4@h after 3nt|pg||
nt|udo: 7@D|pg||
nt|udo: or NT|pg||
nt|udo: lets see|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is natural to bid 4@H rather than 5@C because it is a trick less. When the opponents go to 4@S and you want to bid at the five-level, you have a free choice between hearts and ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: clubs.|pg||
nt|8252: tu as donc 2 pseudos|pg||
nt|ralfwil: As you said Mike a classic preempt with a good result|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: denmark on lead 8-0 Iceland|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: hand nº 6 |pg||
nt|oleberg: 1@D shows 11-15, 4+ diamonds, can have longer clubs|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: seems a 4@H by West|pg||
nt|oleberg: (No, I'm not guessing :))|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this 3N is a bit easier|pg||
nt|Walddk12: Welcome to Eric Robinson|pg||
nt|suketbombi: nice 6@H here inspite of @S watages|pg||
nt|skaftij:  West has a lot in reserve|pg||
nt|skaftij:  2NT GF, @h fit|pg||
nt|riccho: hmm|pg||
nt|idc: 2@h is a weak M-m two suiter|pg||
nt|idc: 5-4+|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: i agree with those 2 arguments you made|pg||
nt|shevek: neither side can make game|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 3nt seems not makable|pg||
nt|tomi2:  lauria only needs to find partner with two aces here, should be possible to find|pg||
nt|corplaw: hi |pg||
nt|bagman: Hi|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ziff:  In a marked contrast to our table Scotland and Italy have won 40 and 46 IMP in 5 boards.....|pg||
nt|lmeili: they should reach to 4@h, 1@c-1@d , 1N 2@c|pg||
nt|tomi2:  sometimes pd will jump to 2 level with 4 cards only and you have a hard bidding later|pg||
nt|tomi2:  os della Monatas hand now worth a raise to 6?|pg||
nt|yuval10: i believe W must add now....P is willing to play in the 5 level ALONE when he's VUL, and you have AK A?|pg||
nt|tomi2:  AKtx of trumps and the ace in their suit?|pg||
nt|yuval10: *she's|pg||
nt|yuval10: very likely that we'll see a sacrifice from NS|pg||
nt|tomi2:  if S bids 5@D now w has a difficult bid|pg||
nt|yuval10: Pass forcing?|pg||
nt|tomi2:  E-W are clearly in a forcing pass situation, but do you pass with TWO small dias?|pg||
nt|roswolf: unless n/s get carried away|pg||
nt|davidb: yes  no  great  boards yet...|pg||
nt|ady: can make 6NT    6@S  beaten on heart lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: the axe might descend here|pg||
nt|davidb: ??  aces...|pg||
nt|bagman: Ok, now let's see how the void is shown|pg||
nt|cameron_1: might chooce 4@s since Drijver's X was prob snapfragon style i.e. 2@s 5@c|pg||
nt|aldek: double showing clubs and a doubleton spade|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@D is natural. She has one diamond, so opens One Diamond.|pg||
nt|oleberg: And a good save in 4@S|pg||
nt|oleberg: Ok, a save|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: a block 3@S by N|pg||
nt|brolucius: Well, it was quite interesting how Gold approached the play - attacking his weakest suit first. |pg||
nt|odysseus69: a boring looking affair here|pg||
nt|odysseus69: can they look for a slam?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: dont think so|pg||
nt|andreasw:  hi Eric|pg||
nt|riccho: In Bd. 4 haben die Russen die Verteidigung gegen Vollspiel "gefunden". 4 Imps für die guten... |pg||
nt|brolucius: Many conventions gain information for one side at the expense of giving that same information to the opponents. That does not make them a mistake.|pg||
mb|3C|nt|athene: it's never easy to bid a grand slam which depends on a void (i.e. where you are off an ace)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: still a possible 5 imps missed|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2NT overcall most likely, but Berg is going for the kill|pg||
nt|idc: At these colours, I like North's pass - now if only South protects|pg||
mb|p|nt|eweber: but NS can escape by cashing their tricks|pg||
nt|lmeili: 2@h 3@h|pg||
nt|haans: close to spade raise|pg||
nt|yuval10: you have to do something with this AKTX trump and A@h|pg||
nt|cameron_1: choose a game i guess, a little strange because most use that to claim "ownership" and show a good hand|pg||
nt|mamos: what strength was 2@h   do we know - forcing ?|pg||
nt|mamos: will england bid on ?|pg||
nt|andreasw:  3nt should not win yes|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: could East X ?|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: can it be 3 card suport?|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: West can go alone to 5@H|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 5@H=11 tricks |pg||
nt|brolucius: England supporters can hope so.|pg||
nt|ady: 3@C   2nd suit     a bit dangerous with that holding|pg||
nt|ady: 4@C a cu   now 4@D?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Does Jørgensen have enough to balance with a double?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He has|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Indeed they are; and EW have the trophies to prove that they may not be playing 2 of the 3 worst conventions in the world|pg||
nt|yuval10: perhaps some will bid 1NT from S|pg||
nt|odysseus69: pass from Versace surprising|pg||
nt|yuval10: East will compete though|pg||
mb|5C|nt|peachy: he ruffed H with the Q, unnecessary|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like another boring hand|pg||
nt|lechcold: dziêki wejciu Brinka nasi dojd¹ do 3BA|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 3@C is more likely some kind of relay I guess|pg||
nt|udo: 4@S EW,,,,,,5@H N/S wird schon zu teuer, wenn man in @C falsch rät ( klein zur 9 )|pg||
nt|psridhar: Cedolin might hv liked XX, AXXXX,X,AQXXX for that opening but he didnt deal that hand :)|pg||
mb|d|nt|peachy: empting to Dbl with S hand|pg||
nt|peachy: tempting|pg||
nt|andersk: If 5@C makes, then 3 NT makes too|pg||
nt|bagman: If N can ask aces, S can bid quite a lot|pg||
nt|athene: did south think 4nt was asking for the minor?|pg||
nt|fokal: sementa has no idea of the @s void , he might try to protect his K of @s|pg||
nt|fokal: by bidding NT|pg||
nt|bagman: Now 5@S, I guess|pg||
nt|fokal: obvisously S interpreted 4NT as 'what is your minor , partner ? '|pg||
nt|athene: they might scramble into the grand if south finds 5@S now|pg||
nt|hawe45:  What was 2 @S exactly?|pg||
nt|bagman: It's bad to have your misunderstanding on a grand slam deal|pg||
nt|athene: but if there really has been a misunderstanding it's asking a lot to recover and go on to bid a tricky seven|pg||
nt|athene: 2@D showed spades, weak or strong (or some monster balanced)|pg||
nt|athene: so 2@S was obviously a cue - whatever they play that as|pg||
nt|hawe45:  So 5 @S now might do...|pg||
nt|cameron_1: i imagine tom was happy not to have to guess over an immediate 4@s from Brink|pg||
nt|MolvaM: thomas bids what he hopes he can make|pg||
nt|MolvaM: reasonable bid but doesnt work today|pg||
nt|MolvaM: but maybe pushes opps to 4@h|pg||
nt|xenya: 2N promises 20+|pg||
nt|Walddk2: His suit might not be solid :)|pg||
nt|lechcold: i wygraj¹|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 6T aurait eu une chance de gagner si E avait cache ses coeurs, mais evidemment 2C est 100% normale|pg||
nt|marlowepi: a cartes ouvertes c'est faisable meme sans entame coeur, mais le dec fera les deux impasses perdantes|pg||
nt|odysseus69: but maybe some exchanges|pg||
nt|cumino: J@D for a good slam instead of Q@C|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, I expect they will do their duty - taking a look for a slam - and then stop in game.|pg||
nt|bagman: Slam requires the spades to come in and diamond guess|pg||
nt|bagman: I have made worse slams |pg||
nt|babs59: more points, more substance to suits :)|pg||
nt|bagman: Even with @DA lead and @DK ruffed, 4@H makes as the @SA falls|pg||
nt|j li: Und schon wieder geht es nur um Überstiche|pg||
nt|davidb: the problem players use too much the conventions . quick aproach  is a good convention often...|pg||
nt|odysseus69: save against 4S|pg||
nt|dburn: as far as I can tell, Lauria and Versace actually play neither support doubles nor leaping Michaels|pg||
nt|yuval10: -3 if they can find the @d ruff|pg||
nt|brolucius: They play that a double by the opener shows a maximum hand.|pg||
mb|p|nt|rigas_karo: 4@s in 5-1 fit in the oper room, probably +1|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: looks like an easy 3NT|pg||
nt|boyklas: its difficult to find the Jxx after this bidding, except if he lead it|pg||
nt|ady: should south double if they get to 6@S    might remove to 6NT|pg||
nt|psridhar: difficult to bid 5d on their own last bd- needed push from oppo|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: a part score 2@S by West|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so W missed to find 4/4 hearts fit|pg||
nt|odysseus69: yes - that would be good- but no wasted club cards is what West needs |pg||
nt|yusufb: eller dengesiz geliyo butun maçlarda ilk 4 bordda baya alýþveriþ olmuþ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good decision, unlucky lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|wygbe1: yep it is|pg||
nt|Walddk12: Good morning to Paul Hackett|pg||
nt|wygbe1: and it was |pg||
nt|ady: problem is not there|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w were merciful but have missed the boat somewhat|pg||
nt|cameron_1: it is usally right to bid on know double fit hands|pg||
nt|tomi2:  but he should not bid 4nt too fast, because it could be keycard for spades, and partner would sell @SAK and no @CA as two aces|pg||
nt|andersk: 4@S is makeable, but <i do not understand why Charlie didnt look for @H suit first|pg||
nt|andersk: need to do something good in @s to make|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: hand 5 other room playing 4@S same contract|pg||
nt|ady: kib said 3@C minimum pt count|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2:  not hackett should bid 5@H rather than double I think|pg||
nt|ady: sorry    blind spot    2 aces missing|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: can go -1 with a good defence timming|pg||
nt|odysseus69: heavy 2D bid for English style|pg||
nt|suketbombi: wonder 4@S was a que or an exclusion key card BW|pg||
nt|barnets: poland in 4@S where Italy made 5@C|pg||
nt|dburn: although their defence to pre-empts is a bit confusing - on the one hand it says that four of a minor shows the other major and that minor|pg||
nt|dburn: but on the other hand it says that a direct cuebid over a weak two in a major shows the other major and a minor|pg||
nt|brolucius: Some players may venture a 1@S opening on the East cards.|pg||
pc|h7|nt|rigas_karo: well this is an easy way :)|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Morning everyone|pg||
nt|peachy: Good morning Paul|pg||
nt|wygbe1: morning|pg||
nt|yuval10: very interesting sequence to work with your partner|pg||
nt|bagman: When a misunderstaning occurs, it's difficult to recover, because neither player knows what the misunderstanding has been|pg||
nt|athene: even if both players suspect, neither one can be sure his partner is in on the secret|pg||
nt|bagman: If N thinks that S has 1 ace and @S-void, he still cannot bid the grand|pg||
nt|athene: these sort of auctions are where top pairs really have to put in the time away from the table|pg||
nt|athene: because there are lots of imps riding on these hands|pg||
nt|lechcold: ogranicznie nie znoszê takich wejæ:)...|pg||

nt|aldek: ale w holandii nie moge nikogo przekonac ze to sensu nie ma|pg||

nt|ralfwil: 11 trickd from top as @dJ is Jxx|pg||
nt|mdgraham: This hand would be perfect for Christmas Party bridge - One Diamond, Two Spades, Three Hearts, Three NoTrump |pg||
nt|mdgraham: Natural Bidding|pg||
nt|ady: 6@D     one control + a void?|pg||
nt|j li: +2, beide @Hverlierer verschwinden auf die Karos|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Wrong king|pg||
pc|h3|nt|boyklas: thats true|pg||

nt|justin c: 4@C...|pg||
nt|odysseus69: only 8 tricks - no sign of 9th|pg||
pc|hA|nt|Gerben42: this contract will be no problem, will duck once to guard against 5-2 @C|pg||
nt|ziff:  2@Sx would have been 3 down at least on a @D lead or switch, but not easy to find, and 620 are available|pg||
nt|star6ija: 11 tricks|pg||
nt|antoniz: Adam zagra przez trefle z powodów komunikacyjnych|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Good evening to Peter Gill|pg||
nt|brolucius: If West shows any interest in a slam (no, I see he has signed off), East would go there with three aces.|pg||
nt|ozgull: bu masada çok hýzlý oynanýyor|pg||
nt|bagman: Maybe not so unlucky as W was likely to have very short spades|pg||
nt|corplaw: N was probably going down in 4S, so sac was a phantom|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|paulhac:  It is a playable game just but not with the trump break they did well to only go 1 off in the othere room|pg||
nt|lmeili: after 1@c 1@d what is 1N shows? some player holds 7 HCP as E they may not inv to game|pg||
nt|andersk: this will be -2 or more|pg||
nt|MolvaM: what about 5@c?|pg||
nt|udo: @D agreed now ?|pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: Czy wygra, to zobaczymy... W jasne karty ³atwo|pg||
nt|psridhar: it is still a 800 /1100 number|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Any other would be fine|pg||
nt|odysseus69: who expected that lead?|pg||
pc|s7|nt|brolucius: 5@H, cue-bid denying a club control. Now 6@C will show first-round club control.|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|wygbe1: playing for 50 hearts, could set up spades and run them through south for down 1, losintg ak of spades and 2 hearts|pg||
nt|h_karluk: -3|pg||
nt|h_karluk: just play off top hearts|pg||
nt|andersk: I know - 3 double dummy, but they dont see all cards:)|pg||
nt|rodvenn: In practice 3@h is a good bid|pg||
nt|h_karluk: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_total_tricks|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer is happy to see this dummy; quite sure make and quite a bad slam|pg||
nt|cumino: But EST is 12-14 bal, there isn't many cards for slam|pg||
nt|brolucius: A few pairs will get too high, you can be sure.|pg||
nt|olegario: E needed a bit more to try|pg||
nt|yusufb: baya hýzlý |pg||
nt|jkotor: @h blocked!|pg||
pc|sK|nt|Gerben42: sry always 2nd stopper|pg||
nt|eweber: just heard the second match of the Dutch was 11-19 vs Spain|pg||
nt|aldek: 4@S was close as well|pg||
nt|tomi2:  with 5@H he committses himself to 6 level even if partners @C were QJT, or does 4@S also show @C control?|pg||
nt|udo: hard now|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe Versace was trying to give Lauria a ruff, in case that double had Lightner connotations|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|motu: depends on vul|pg||
nt|h_karluk: true|pg||
nt|yuval10: now only 2 down....can't be good for the leaders|pg||
nt|xenya: 12 tricks |pg||
nt|ftpe: yes|pg||
nt|ftpe: south should play club|pg||
nt|brolucius: Versace may think: 'I must have club ace to suggest a grand slam (with another spade cue-bid), so this is more accurate, showing @SK too.|pg||
nt|lesh: have to guess right|pg||
nt|petergill: Hi everyone|pg||
nt|bagman: Now comes a diamond and down goes the contract|pg||
nt|athene: hard to find the low heart lead|pg||
nt|odysseus69: -o the hearts - 4th highest best|pg||
nt|jkotor: i would take more than 8|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ziff:  undo?|pg||

nt|andersk: Do you good people understand the 5@C raise?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: if we are talking abt std signals|pg||
nt|andersk: I would probably try 3 NT|pg||
nt|h_karluk: by N?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: yes lots of game plus - but slam minus  hands|pg||
nt|odysseus69: i should look before I leap|pg||
nt|idc: a trump at some point looks sensible from South|pg||
pc|d8|nt|eweber: results of round 2 are online by now |pg||
nt|eweber: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/10Ostend/asp/roundteams.asp?qtournid=820&qroundno=2|pg||
nt|eweber: England leading the group with 50(!)|pg||
nt|eweber: Russia 13th with 27|pg||
nt|eweber: NL 17th of 19 with 17|pg||
nt|othered1: But first south recues @S, guaranteeing some kind of @C control, I'd think|pg||
nt|udo: 5@S is ?|pg||
nt|brolucius: He would just bid 6@D with second-round club control.|pg||
nt|tomi2:  5@S = both black aces|pg||
nt|udo: i am told @S king and first round club|pg||
nt|brolucius: Well, he has already shown @SA, hasn't he? (With 4@S).|pg||
nt|tomi2:  probably with no @SK he'd bid 6@C|pg||
nt|brolucius: Indeed.|pg||
nt|udo: and 6@D with second round @C controll?|pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: Teraz to zmusili Go do zrobienia nadróbki...|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|mamos: England have done well on this board I feel|pg||
nt|othered1: And Lauria selects the highest scoring (and unbreakable, if partner has 1@D) spot.|pg||
nt|davidb: versace thought X by passed hand will show very short H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Lauria-Versace's leaping Michaels version is this: leap to the 4-level usually 6 of the minor and 5 of the major, weaker than 2M (3M)|pg||
pc|h5|nt|haans: Bulgaria do not play Blue Clubs but Precision|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: dangerous but works here |pg||
nt|psridhar: true 3h makes -but two eight card fits deterred the pairs from venturing into 3 level -THE LAW :)|pg||
nt|tomi2:  problem is again, waht does he bid with no club control? 5nt is nonforcing?|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|boyklas: 4C at te open room? not 4S?|pg||
nt|lmeili: tx, that means they'll reach 4@h any how|pg||
nt|andersk: Need AQxxxxx and almost nothing more for it to be makeable|pg||
nt|roswolf: israel avoided the slam on bd 3 in the other room and so gained 11|pg||
nt|star6ija: yes|pg||
nt|star6ija: no trump is 14-16...and some new gadgets over 1@c openning|pg||
nt|brolucius: But it was West who had the chance to make a try. East was merely following the route to describe 12-14 with three spades.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Even discards are discouraging.|pg||
pc|c8|nt|mcarroll: In a word - No - I do not understand it|pg||
nt|andersk: 3 NT is my choise|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hard to reach there|pg||
nt|andersk: hard to reach 3 NT?|pg||
nt|andersk: Just pull it out of your bidding box:)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: can you make a sample bidding?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: LOL|pg||
nt|h_karluk: it should be played by N|pg||
nt|aldek: could not do better|pg||
nt|ralfwil: hellom Peter|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer could have made the contract by drawing trumps and setting up clubs|pg||
nt|suketbombi: shd be reached in other room too|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|mamos: surely not|pg||
nt|mamos: not @hK|pg||
nt|xenya: but declarer can either get @Ds righ or squeeze N in the reds |pg||
nt|rodvenn: that is not the law as I understand it|pg||
nt|bagman: WIth no transportation possible between the defenders, declarer took the sure way to make his game|pg||
nt|athene: nothing there was so unreasonable but still lots of ways for poland to gain on the board|pg||
nt|odysseus69: so I was the only one surprised|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jkmjanusz: 5@C w 5 tylko bez jednej. 16 IMP|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But he thinks partner has @SQ after the lead|pg||
pc|c7|nt|rnmalik: 9 tricks.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: welcome again.|pg||
nt|arigun: simdi koz oynarisa batiyor galiba|pg||
nt|yusufb: þimdi sýra bizde|pg||
nt|yuval10: so only -2 now|pg||
pc|c2|nt|corplaw: because of the very favorable drop of AQJ of clubs|pg||
nt|bagman: Now the rest is easy on cross ruff discarding a diamond on @SK|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: West bid 4@s over 2@h|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: but maybe he bid 4@c to indicate @c +@s and east (reasonably) passed with singleton @s|pg||
nt|collins64: no Filippos opened 2@h with his 6-card J|pg||
nt|andersk: I understan that 3 @S is a tempting bid|pg||
nt|star6ija: this sequence showed 4-4-4-1 singleton not defined, 2N was relay and 3@c showed @d singleton - 4@h denies control outside|pg||
nt|aldek: the operator is in trouble, it seems|pg||
nt|mamos: vugraph op???????   you there?|pg||
nt|xenya: for the same result|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: 3NT might have made iF south led a high heart .... but 4@C is going 4 off|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes|pg||
pc|cK|nt|collins64: and West bid 4@c with his 55 passed by East|pg||
nt|boyklas: ok, 10 imps for greece|pg||
nt|cameron_1: seems right result|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Wouldn't we all?|pg||
nt|psridhar: S needed to overtake that dia and shoot a h...now defense has lost a trick|pg||
nt|psridhar: still i fancy 500|pg||
nt|idc: South still had a chance - he should perhaps realize that partner is in danger of trump endplays|pg||
nt|psridhar: i wonder why he chose to let the dia king stand; he knows it is not stiff since he led the riskier spd king doubleton|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|rodvenn: two 8-card fits make you compete to the 3-level according to the law|pg||
nt|odysseus69: the only question now is how long it will take for 10 tricks|pg||
pc|c3|nt|andersk: understand|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|peachy: good line to keep it down 1q|pg||
nt|haans: will lose 2 clubs|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: jakby bylo bez dwóch o dziwo przyby³by impik|pg||

nt|arigun: tuzak bir board, dekleranin @h uzerine oynamasi gerekiyordu yapabilmesi icin|pg||
pc|dK|nt|peachy: 1|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Cedolin must have a pretty god picture of the layout and will likely play a club|pg||
nt|idc: To be fair, this is an unnaturally early hour to be playing bridge - 9:30 start local time I believe|pg||
nt|psridhar: he will need to ruff that club nevertheless , else South's tiny trump will score|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Right, in the middle of the night|pg||
nt|idc: At most Irish & Scottish events, last night's parties wouldn't be finished yet|pg||
nt|psridhar: Some would rather see 0930 hrs in their 'night' than in the morning :)|pg||
pc|dT|nt|wygbe1: looks like that is the line adopted|pg||
nt|peachy: without the Dbl, it is not as obvious|pg||
nt|andersk: I type too fast:)|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: to take opps out of the 8 card fit |pg||
nt|haans: 8 carder outside of the law|pg||
nt|h_karluk: thanks to Marty and Larry, sorry for wrong remembered that devised by Mike|pg||
nt|bagman: A heart ruff and two diamond losers were declarer's worries|pg||
nt|brolucius: Now a possible squeeze if North has the two minor-suit kings.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|yuval10: 4@s by EW OR|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|lesh: wrong guess which leads to -1|pg||
nt|idc: nicely done Cedolin|pg||
nt|brolucius: East had no odd diamond to play, so attempted to cancel the 'even' message by playing his highest diamond spot.|pg||

nt|athene: well there's no way anyone is guessing all that|pg||
nt|athene: what they need is some way for north to agree hearts|pg||
nt|athene: then it's relatively easy|pg||
nt|athene: but slam auctions are hard when no-one knows what trumps are|pg||
nt|bagman: I'm sure they'll go back to the drawing board after this match|pg||

nt|psridhar: Italy duplicated the earlier 4s for d2 other room|pg||

mb|p|nt|lesh: a peaceful 4@h here, but lets see|pg||

nt|h_karluk: in practice very hard to reach, given layout diamonds favorably placed|pg||

nt|jameslee 2: Spain had some yeterday againtx portugal at football :)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: maybe over 2D there were some other exciting responses- maybe 3D to show 5 good diamonds and 3 spades|pg||
nt|ady: hand 4 where Iceland could have gone down 1 in 1NT   Israel mad an overtrick|pg||

mb|p|nt|h_karluk: unless Sweden gifts some seems Austria's this team couldn't scratch something useful|pg||

nt|yuval10: so "only" 5 imps to Austria|pg||
nt|mamos: i think youd want to be in game|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 5c has much chances if declare can manage the 4-0 split|pg||
nt|tomi2:  7@D could be in danger of some ruff, not likely, but why take the risc...|pg||
mb|1H|nt|peachy: 4H rolls now,, on lucky spade sit|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Although the K@S is right the K@D is wrong so 4@H is an excellent contract|pg||
nt|peachy: EW have a paying sacrifice, rare at Vul|pg||
nt|andersk: Might be possible to bid game here|pg||
nt|bagman: If North was confident that 4NT was RKCB in hearts, that was a good bid; no need to re-cue with 3@S|pg||
nt|fokal: but maybe S could (should ?) have bid something else than 6@h|pg||
nt|haans: the law is not the law just suggestions :)|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: another part score hand |pg||
nt|udo: guess after 3 NT Lauria gave him club A or King|pg||
nt|brolucius: If North has a club more and a diamond fewer, he would be delighted to hear of the @SK, which would give a second club discard.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: not guilty Maam :) i was living in an ocean away and the internet was not invented. i was just thirsty and eager to buy any foreign bridge book, thanks |pg||

nt|jameslee 2: 2NT= 8 tricks |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: think he will claim |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: straigh away|pg||

mb|2S|nt|paulhac:  Isnt it 800?|pg||
nt|peachy: oops|pg||
nt|peachy: I think I need another cup of coffee!!!|pg||

nt|paulhac:  Without a heart ruff|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 4 cards M 4th seat|pg||

nt|athene: well, it was only good if he was confident and he knew his partner was confident it was, too :)|pg||
nt|athene: that is one strange double of 1@C|pg||
nt|bagman: In confusion, it's often a good idea to bid something, which can be passed )|pg||

nt|petergill: NS Convention Card http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/May/WomensTeams/sweden/SandraRimstedt-EmmaSjoberg_SWEDEN_WOMEN.pdf |pg||
nt|mdgraham: there's something odd about the NS system file from ECATS. Page 1 is ok, but page 2 is peculair |pg||
nt|petergill: 3@S by South then 3NT by North, maybe?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@H looks like a control response, but I can't read the print|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@H = 8+ HCP, no 6m, no 5M, not 4M and longer suit is roughly what I can read |pg||
nt|brolucius: I am often thought of as mad in that respect.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 1S denies spades|pg||
nt|odysseus69: I am sure that at pairs Versace would have played heart jack- he felt that West had Q |pg||

nt|udo: 4@D -4@S|pg||
nt|riccho: sieht so aus|pg||
nt|riccho: aber gut zu sehen, dass es kein Zufall ist,  dass man 6@s vermeidet|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2@S is described as 'artificial, strong'.|pg||
mb|p|nt|collins64: after minor opening and opponent's double they play transfer|pg||
nt|yuval10: 5@c is cold, so many imps here on the line perhaps|pg||
nt|MolvaM: hands seem to be quiet, compared to the previous match|pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: Mo¿e wypuszcz¹?|pg||
nt|aldek: ale ostatnio zrezygnowali z tego pomyslu|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: alot of bidding again on a poor 7 count|pg||
nt|barnets: hacketts did bid 5@D as I suggested - will be another england swing|pg||
nt|barnets: not even x|pg||
nt|cumino: 5@d not doubledb board 4|pg||
nt|psridhar: that 3s showed an invitn hand with spds|pg||
nt|idc: I would have expected that too Padmanabhan, but I guess he chose this to invite instead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Somehow the Danes survived boards 4 and 5 when they bid too much in this room. Both flat|pg||
mb|4H|nt|boyklas: take 5D, 1S, 1H and leave|pg||
nt|lmeili: though 6@d makable, i would prefer for 3N|pg||
nt|tomi2:  they are on their way to 6@D it seems :)|pg||
nt|motu: 4@D is aceasking|pg||
nt|tomi2:  not 4@C?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: no matter @c lead|pg||
nt|andersk: @C A AQ in @S and @H J|pg||
nt|haans: 5@D jump may be based on previous bidding|pg||
nt|MolvaM: no 7600 distribution so far :)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  sry was away for a bid there:)|pg||
nt|ftpe: well ew had play for 4 hearts, but ns bougth contract in 2 cl on 4-3 fit|pg||
nt|barnets: 5@D passed out big swing for england|pg||
nt|yusufb: 3@c naturelmi yada minorlerden birini secmi onu düþünüyo salvo|pg||
nt|bagman: Trump switch unlikely to help as the hearts are so nicely|pg||
mb|p|nt|eweber: Imp scoring doesn't seem to work, 5 Imps for Russia until Board 4, if I count correctly|pg||
nt|h_karluk: quickly jettison loser|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: good lord even adding T + 9 I cant see how N is worth 3 bids|pg||
nt|brolucius: A clever method, showing spades but not going past the safety level of 2@H.|pg||
mb|p|nt|motu: 4@C would be aceasking for @S|pg||
nt|tomi2:  but is @S suit possible after not raising?|pg||
nt|lmeili: 4th step shows how many key cards?|pg||
nt|tomi2:  2+@Dq|pg||
nt|motu: 2+ trump Q|pg||
nt|lmeili: tx|pg||
nt|h_karluk: to spades|pg||
nt|h_karluk: overtakes K and enjoys|pg||
nt|roswolf: with the diamonds 3-2 no problem|pg||
nt|udo: must be|pg||
nt|udo: 11 tricks,, next:)|pg||
nt|brolucius: 1@H must have been a transfer but I cannot see anything about it on the conv-card that I have up.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: mais aux yeux fermes|pg||
nt|barnets: so very fast start for england here|pg||
nt|odysseus69: this is going well for England but more significantly for Israel|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulhac:  Best lead but he could have led anything|pg||
nt|MolvaM: u didnt miss much andreas|pg||
nt|andreasw:  great:)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: declarer tries to protect himself against the 2 diamond honors being offside|pg||
nt|MolvaM: so he just gave up a heart trick that he could establish by taking his @hA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes it is, X would have shown hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They play transfers after interference|pg||
nt|udo: last time i played them ( San Remo),, they played transfers|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think a tad stretched 2@s works better than X there|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: na drugim stole to samo - arcymistrzowski overbid|pg||
nt|petergill: Fiona not missing out on the extra 100, plus a heart lead (sdummy's first bid "suit might ensue from her Dbl|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Dhondy used Leaping Michaels (4@D) over the 3@C opener. Wrong time - 500|pg||
nt|petergill: which would be great if South had another heart|pg||
nt|odysseus69: heading for normal but unlikely to make 4 hearts|pg||

nt|hawe45:  OK|pg||

nt|ozgull: veya 3cl -1 2nt -2 olacaktý|pg||
nt|yusufb: 2nt ye @c cýkýlabilir olmaz o zaman|pg||
nt|yusufb: zaten E bi aar @s der|pg||
nt|idc: I would have driven to game with the East hand - not that it will always make of course|pg||
nt|brolucius: Italy 5 VPs ahead of Poland at the moment.|pg||
nt|dburn: I suppose if they'd headed for 3NT instead, they'd have made it, but this is the "standard" contract|pg||
nt|odysseus69: i only said unlikely - there always seems to be a way home |pg||
nt|dburn: they could also have tried two spades redoubled, which is likely to make|pg||
nt|davidb: Lauria might play J H  ,after  N X  -than he wins|pg||
pc|dA|nt|kdr_fm: whats extrodinary is that 3NT is going to be real hard to beat|pg||
pc|d7|nt|bagman: AK and a low heart?|pg||
nt|lechcold: tym rozdaniem obie pary NS nie bêd¹ mog³y siê specjalnie szczyciæ|pg||
nt|snetram:  oby siÄ para B-N nie zagotowaÅa. MajÄ dwa zÅe rozdania|pg||
nt|james_h: not on this lead|pg||
nt|brolucius: All commentators are impartial, of course, but that only refers to their utterances on the screen. Some of them are cheering loudly at each swing in the right direction.|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|motu: everything is possible here:)|pg||
nt|athene: just the five obvious tricks to lose here|pg||
nt|petergill: Susan as expected leads a heart - dummy's first bid "suit", after the Dbl|pg||
nt|odysseus69: best to cash 2nd club -then d|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Pretty trick|pg||
nt|psridhar: 4s will make here with spd king in the box and cl q being stiff|pg||
nt|davidb: because with KQ sp & K H  N might overcall|pg||
nt|brolucius: North's double showed long (and strong) spades, so he is likely to be shorter than South in hearts. Hence the suggestion that East may lead the @HJ in an attempt to pin a singleton ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: 10 or 9 with North.|pg||
pc|c2|nt|eweber: no miracle in the 4@h contract, but an imp for Russia anyway|pg||
nt|tomi2:  so 1 kexcard is missing and they stop in (a bad) game - I am no fan of this auction...|pg||
nt|chick: or a simple 2@H overcall|pg||
nt|justin c: hi james|pg||
nt|corplaw:  diamond to disrupt communications and set up ruff|pg||
nt|andreasw:  safe play|pg||
nt|sastro: kann nicht verstehen, dass man im anderen Raum etwas anderes als eine @H Topfigur ausspielz|pg||
nt|j li: Der andere Raum hat von der anderen Seite gespielt|pg||
nt|riccho: also wieder rnd Überstichimps|pg||
pc|c4|nt|lmeili: at least it makes even guess wrong @s|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|h_karluk: just needs to play a trump|pg||
nt|h_karluk: say East played Ace and switched back to @c|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ruff with K|pg||
nt|athene: red ace-kings and a diamond ruff|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: no entrys in West to develope the @D |pg||
nt|h_karluk: well aren't we ready to play at least 3 level in any suit ? |pg||
nt|chick: EW potentially had 3N, so a disaster for NS is not a given|pg||
nt|lesh: a possible 800, South has to be careful|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: tam król kier sie utrzyma³|pg||
nt|aldek: problem jest nastepujacy, jak pas jest forsujacy to czy zaprasza do 5-ciu czy do 6-ciu|pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: E - nie nmajak wypucic...|pg||
nt|8252: EO vont mener 4 0 mais ça va s'arreter là|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: ya east has too many entries|pg||
nt|bagman: The defense can take 2 clubs, a diamond and two trumps + a trick|pg||
nt|bagman: the trick can be either 3rd trump wiht a diamond overruff or a heart|pg||
nt|odysseus69: and now 3rd club|pg||
nt|bagman: Another safe play would have been one high trump from dummy and then hearts|pg||
nt|athene: i guess this will lose two hearts and one trick in each of the other suits, for one down|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|collins64: about the previous deal, you always have to discuss before is it or not GF 4@c overcall after weak 2@h opening|pg||
nt|MolvaM: now he can do his throw in|pg||
nt|jkotor: to mówi: "nie wiem czy ich X, czy graæ wy¿ej"|pg||
nt|jkotor: tak przynajmniej ja rozumiem pasa forsuj¹cego|pg||
pc|h3|nt|h_karluk: @h A  favorably placed|pg||
nt|MolvaM: which he didnt need actually :)|pg||
nt|james_h: hi boyz|pg||
nt|petergill: Fiona will (eventually, there's no rush) cash out|pg||
nt|motu: hallo zusammen|pg||
nt|riccho: hallo!|pg||
nt|j li: Hi|pg||
nt|sastro: moin Martin|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hQ|nt|athene: no chance for the defence to get a trump promotion going and i don't see why declarer should take a backwards trump finesse|pg||
nt|xenya: S showed 5-4 in the minors, but clubs could longer than diamonds, so N had to guess -- hence his pass over 2@C|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|collins64: West had a very nice hand with 19HCP and East Pass with 2 Kings and a 7-card Q10 suit|pg||
nt|rnmalik: oops|pg||
nt|haans: we all see the clubs finesse|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Italy gained 10 when Russia played silly 4C contract here and 3NT next door|pg||
nt|ady: can be held to 8 |pg||
pc|hA|pc|s5|nt|andersk: wrong slam|pg||
nt|andersk: normal line|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 10 @C could come in play |pg||
pc|h4|nt|collins64: x Kxx Q10xxxxx KJ|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: if 4@c is not GF easts is reasonable however, he thinks the hand is a misfit, and his K@h can be a wasted value|pg||
nt|andersk: a lucky make|pg||
nt|andersk: since @H K is together with 3 card @S|pg||
nt|rnmalik: no on a @H finesse can make 7. @D lead would force him to take a finesse.|pg||
nt|andersk: I must be sleeping, 6 is alw cold|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: Sorry for the rush for the previous deql now we are align with the players|pg||
nt|rnmalik: ok and thanks.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but still may go down|pg||
nt|davidb: board  6  was classical  SPL   -suit preference lead -  high H for D |pg||
nt|ady: ooops     Patchman trying to protect possible entry and clear the hearts|pg||
nt|andreasw:  ok 9 trick's |pg||
nt|mdgraham: pity about the club ruff|pg||
nt|mdgraham: bit of a gift, that|pg||
nt|ady: sorry   9|pg||
nt|suketbombi: cud have made 10 here if he ducked the @H|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|motu: i do not see why E went beyond 3N since 2N shoed allready extras|pg||
nt|ziff:  Not easy to bid, as W may have 5 @D and @SA instead of KJ, making slam pretty good|pg||
nt|bagman: No trump promotion but the old fashioned tap|pg||
nt|bagman: Now a heart and ruff with 9 ?|pg||
nt|haans: best not is spades|pg||
nt|aldek: who should bid 4, east or west?|pg||
nt|rodvenn: not vulnerable you should, according to the law, always compete to the 3-level holding 8 against 8. They make, you go one down in the typical example|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Ivan needs subway tickets to enter the table and that doesn't help much|pg||
nt|petergill: the club ruffs were hard to find - EW will be happy with plus 200|pg||
nt|psridhar: the 4th dia in dummy will take care of declarer's cl loser|pg||
nt|yuval10: he's going down now|pg||
nt|brolucius: However, Victor was right with his 'unlikely to make' prediction.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ziff:  Hope springs eternal, as they say, but I agree that it was agressive|pg||
nt|athene: he is more likely to ruff with the queen surely|pg||
nt|MolvaM: but its good for discussions after the match with yr teammates: "I could have made it even if both @d honors were off"|pg||
nt|haans: Body in clubs very good|pg||
nt|rodvenn: of course you may feel that your hand has intermideate cards in their suit which makes you take another course|pg||
nt|petergill: @SA then @HA is what I would do|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But is X only for a @h lead? not in my opinion, so a @c lead is not so far away. But in nt - yes|pg||
pc|c6|nt|eweber: I don't count correcly, 4:1 is correct|pg||
nt|h_karluk: now trump promo possible|pg||
nt|bagman: what would you do then?|pg||
nt|cameron_1: i think they play the method 3m=non max lin linked M and 3M=max in other M|pg||
nt|mamos: I dont think West can    |pg||
nt|haans: endplay in hearts|pg||
nt|corplaw: can make 4 by playing a heart, but chooses to cross ruff for 3|pg||
pc|s8|nt|rnmalik: No @H finesse 6.|pg||
nt|andersk: East will get a trumph raise|pg||
nt|ftpe: will be poor result for ns i think|pg||
nt|bagman: Easts spade is too low to force the @SK|pg||
nt|davidb: I  think he would make it  on the second day of the event|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|andersk: unfortunate for the sweeds|pg||
nt|h_karluk: the declarer should play a trump to K before touching @h|pg||
nt|cameron_1: so it was up to tom|pg||
nt|udo: hm,,,,was this the best line?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: PS, what is your first name among friends? :)|pg||
pc|cK|nt|rnmalik: tricky hand after very good lead of @D. we have seen all cards so easy for us.:)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3@S in E is key to its making without finesse also which is % wise low.|pg||
nt|andersk: Austrians|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ruff and do that - now or never|pg||
nt|haans: and a make???|pg||
nt|h_karluk: not really|pg||
nt|h_karluk: if pitches and plays a trump to table goes down to @c shift|pg||
nt|h_karluk: if ruffs and plays a trump to hand always makes, thinner than a hair line|pg||
nt|haans: best play was not to cover|pg||
nt|Walddk12: Good morning to Peter Crouch|pg||
nt|xenya: quite poor, yes|pg||
nt|xenya: 2@D is certainly better, although i'm not sure it makes |pg||
nt|lesh: 500 now, against 4@h it is a good result|pg||
nt|marlowepi: un spec astucieux note que 6P est faisable sur la donne precedente|pg||
nt|james_h: Terry is watchin the pips|pg||

nt|h_karluk: as we see all cards easy, i doubt same for him/her|pg||
pc|sT|nt|andreasw:  :) *i could*|pg||
nt|lesh: here is nothing East can do to prevent South from taking 3more spade tricks|pg||
nt|odysseus69: sorry Lauria was declarer - also fine player|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ziff:  If 2N showed extras, yes|pg||
nt|mamos: same auction exactly in OR|pg||
nt|haans: well done|pg||
nt|james_h: hence taking the @sA|pg||
nt|james_h: Terry (W)|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: S will hope the @CA is with west now|pg||
nt|james_h: I dont think he has great expectations|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: well AQ9xx and ace is enough to double 2@d ... but he'll be disappointed|pg||
pc|cT|nt|xenya: best he could do was play the @SQ|pg||
nt|bagman: Now declarer is quite badly placed. He'll probably ruffs a heart high|pg||
pc|h7|nt|h_karluk: that's off one|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: he is full off 10/9 cards fos Nt contract lovely deal |pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|h_karluk: fifty fifty, 3 tricks for EW also|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ftpe: well|pg||
nt|ftpe: ew migthy bid 4 he|pg||
nt|jkotor: @d was better than @h|pg||
pc|h6|nt|andersk: had to start with a small @D from dummy, to avoid truph promotion|pg||
pc|s4|nt|haans: kick them when they are down|pg||
nt|james_h: I dont think She has great expectstions (thanks kib)|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|xenya: 3 off now|pg||
nt|psridhar: Sridhar is what i am called; but PS is fine ( convenient)|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|bagman: Bocchi's trump big enough to score|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 2 down- maybe get Italy on scoreboard|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer makes the two high trumps from dummy for -2|pg||
nt|barnets: tthey will get on board 5 -200 in 1n|pg||
mc|9|nt|eweber: and of course the Imp in 4@h was for NL|pg||
nt|brolucius: East did open 1@S (on the 5@C doubled hand), South doubled and West raised to 4@S, shutting out the club sacrifice. A deserved swing.|pg||

nt|collins64: if it is NF|pg||
nt|paulhac:  England takes the lead for the first time.|pg||
nt|andersk: unlucky board for the Austrians|pg||
nt|h_karluk: west still should refuse to overruff for a late trump promo possibility|pg||
nt|yuval10: and she did|pg||
nt|roswolf: overtrick imps to ireland|pg||
nt|bagman: sure, Q works when there is a legal chance for beat|pg||
nt|bagman: 9 works only as deception|pg||
nt|andreasw:  again board 4 is wrong!!!|pg||
nt|shevek: quite a few declarers went down in 3NT here|pg||
nt|MolvaM: andreas maybe you shld forget the past and move on :)|pg||
nt|xenya: strange -- perhaps the real play was different|pg||
nt|udo: i am not yet awake, but i doubt it|pg||
nt|marlowepi: mais encore une fois c'est a cartes ouvertes|pg||
nt|ralfwil: this will be fast. take the 8 first and run|pg||
nt|andreasw:  good safe play|pg||
nt|j li: Wer eröffnet mit West?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The seniors only play 16 boards. They get tired|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: 2 suiter i think|pg||
nt|roswolf: they multi with a 1 suiter weak 2|pg||
nt|bagman: or is it actually so?|pg||
nt|andreasw:  neeeverrr:)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 3@c shows what?|pg||
nt|shevek: no, not from here !|pg||
nt|MolvaM: both minors?|pg||
nt|shevek: 3@c = 5-5 in the minors|pg||
nt|andreasw:  it should|pg||
nt|hawe45:  E/O ou N/S?|pg||
nt|ady: apparently made 10|pg||
nt|psridhar: so far the Danes hv got what they were looking for...|pg||
mb|p|nt|collins64: another 2@c opening in North|pg||
nt|athene: will south double 2@H or bid 2@S?|pg||
nt|riccho: Andreas|pg||
nt|sastro: Kirmse|pg||
nt|riccho: :)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|andersk: Italy running good in Bridge, but currently out of the world cup|pg||
nt|star6ija: 3N is possible here|pg||
nt|aldek: I'd say west should bid on the base of the quality of the spades, an ace and a singleton|pg||
nt|cameron_1: i agree|pg||
nt|andreasw:  i will go a few times and be back after 10 second's have to see score's from danaish match:)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  danish*|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 3nt would be nice if thomas knew about the @hK with partner|pg||
nt|MolvaM: good luck andreas|pg||
nt|andreasw:  5@d is also a winner:p|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: other room playing 5@D X also on hand nº 5|pg||
nt|udo: or was it best saftey for 10|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I would be reluctant to question any line by Lauria :)|pg||
nt|snetram:  Drijver zaprzeczyÅ samemu sobie|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: board 6 3NT made cutting the damage @s lead|pg||
nt|justin c: decent 6@S here|pg||
nt|eamongall: well folks ye better get your armour on ...as Michael has just been mugged in the other room |pg||
nt|odysseus69: hands up those who like 1NT - my hand stays down|pg||
nt|udo: ich eigentlich immer, auch wenn  meinem Partner dann manchmal die Haare zu Berge stehen|pg||
nt|riccho: Also Dein Partner dann wahrscheinlich nicht... :)|pg||
nt|athene: south will get excited now with 6-4 majors|pg||
nt|athene: it doesn't take much to get this south excited in the bidding, actually|pg||
mb|p|nt|collins64: both majors at least 44|pg||
nt|boyklas: i think he judged that the hand shouldnt be to game with the singleton S and the KH wasted value after showing C+S|pg||
nt|bagman: If partner has Txx left, both the 9 and the Q work; what about other holdings?|pg||
nt|ftpe: boring cards again|pg||
nt|justin c: expect south will drive to slam now|pg||
nt|udo: wenn ein Fit zu Tage kommt, ist es gut,,wenn es in Sa endet, meist grausam|pg||
nt|psridhar: at end of bd 7 they shd be + about 28 imps|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They are doing better than the open team against Italy the other day. 8-118 I think it was|pg||
mb|2C|nt|star6ija: stubborn @s stopper|pg||
nt|haans: 14-16 nt|pg||
nt|psridhar: is South's pass forcing? |pg||
nt|udo: me too,,,therefore i asked only:)|pg||
nt|othered1: for 10 tricks, I don't see better|pg||
nt|brolucius: The players in the Open Room are not exactly burning the baize with their playing speed, They are three boards behind already.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 7 boards and 24 IMPs exchanged, interesting|pg||
nt|aldek: przeczytaj moje pytanie, prosze|pg||
nt|petergill: EW Convention Card http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/May/WomensTeams/england/stockdale-brown.pdf|pg||
nt|bagman: NS can make 4@H here, the 11th trick can come from the spade lead or spade guess|pg||
nt|brolucius: Gold found an 11-count that he was willing to pass. (Only a jack in the long suit, and four jacks in all.)|pg||
nt|bagman: Now he needs to describe the 'impossible' hand|pg||
nt|riccho: 3F sind immer schwer zu judgen|pg||
nt|motu: ich würde vermutlich passen|pg||
nt|j li: Ich bin auch ein Passant|pg||
mb|p|nt|jameslee 2: East a take out 2@D on a dangerous 1Nt X|pg||
nt|lesh: probably E will bid 2@s or 2@h|pg||
nt|yusufb: 3@d|pg||
nt|corplaw: that is E-W bidding|pg||
nt|ady: n/s  have 3NT|pg||
nt|riccho: In einem NAT System wie Gro und Andreas es spielen, würde ich vermutlich auch passen. |pg||
nt|athene: simple 4@S looks possible, but he takes it slower|pg||
mb|2H|nt|paulhac:  IF East had been the overcaller one could say that Spain were unlucky|pg||
nt|h_karluk: well, sorry i disagree that was unlucky|pg||
nt|roswolf: south will no doubt transfer and offer his pard a choice of games|pg||
nt|shevek: you can watch any match here :)  http://www.bridgebase.com/client/vugraph.php|pg||
nt|andreasw:  thx mucht|pg||
nt|andreasw:  3@h slam invit?|pg||
nt|shevek: looks like it|pg||
nt|andreasw:  no best slam with @d AK out:)|pg||
nt|shevek: but 5@d is not a make|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 5d seems ok since defence cannot take their club ruff with a small trump|pg||
nt|rodvenn: Very good bridge to reach 5 @d in both rooms. |pg||
nt|james_h: 2@d XX being played at the other table|pg||
nt|james_h: NS|pg||
nt|eamongall: The Great Mulall managed 2@DXX a few months ago in the Regent up 3 ... Michael is not having the same success |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: another missfit in @S for N-S|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: shooting to 3NT |pg||
nt|brolucius: He may bid 3@S to show a sound raise to 4@H. No, 2NT does the job.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 2NT is a heart raise|pg||
nt|odysseus69: cant imagine them missing game|pg||
nt|bagman: Townsend has enought to bid/force to game|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: or the score is wrong -- that happens from time to time|pg||
nt|lesh: but over 2@h West might blast to a game|pg||
nt|oleberg: The natural @D lead, will give the 9.th trick immidiately|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 3NT with a missfit is alays veryvery dificult |pg||
nt|oleberg: The natural heart lead is better :)|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 1 of the thing we try to teach bridge students is to go to game to 3NT with a fit in a minor |pg||
nt|mdgraham: and mine|pg||
nt|riccho: In precision würde ich auch passen, um nicht 2@c aufmachen zu müssen|pg||
mb|2N|nt|chick: don't think a major suit game is possible|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: Buras wita sie z g¹sk¹ - poszli mu w kiera...|pg||
nt|hawe45:  OK - cÂ´est possible|pg||
nt|petergill: EW at the other table won the World Junior (U26) Pairs Championship in 2006 in Piestany, Slovakia, the only female pair ever to do so|pg||
nt|petergill: Cecilia Rimstedt was only 18 at the time, I think|pg||
nt|corplaw: bidding is off|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes must be|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: 2NT might have been alerted, otherwise I don't understand it|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 5@d good|pg||
nt|shevek: actually might make|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: second X pass out |pg||
nt|psridhar: this can be set 800|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: quite  a few down -3/-4 could be the result|pg||
nt|brolucius: If Madala had passed, some use 2NT by North to show a sound four-card heart raise and 2@S to show a sound three-card raise.|pg||
nt|bagman: 3NT might be makeable here|pg||
nt|suketbombi: nothing helps here not even the @S lead|pg||
nt|brolucius: Poland 8 IMPs behind Germany, Italy will be pleased to hear.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|wygbe1: probably lebensohl|pg||
nt|santyclz: The 6@h+1 ended as a push.  Neither n/s was able to overcome the preempt.|pg||
nt|star6ija: happens... :)|pg||
nt|shevek: yes|pg||
nt|haans: easier to play 2@D doubles not game sore if make|pg||
nt|psridhar: if defense can find the club ruff-they will get plenty of opportunities for the ruff|pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: Tam wyszli po raz drugi w Kiera. Alew chyba nie dadza rady wypuciæ|pg||
nt|8252: on devrait abdiquer, les @s ont souvent raison|pg||
nt|james_h: 19 imps|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: whoa 2200 ...|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: here after a major 2@S= very dificult to be in a correct contract |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: @S brake nicely |pg||
nt|riccho: Jetzt bekommt Andreas hier mit seiner Hand aber Frühlingsgefühle... |pg||
nt|idc: Watched some of that but it became too much after a while|pg||
mb|p|nt|lesh: well looks like over 2@s as well :)|pg||
nt|chick: perhaps with a club finesse to dump a heart, this could make|pg||
nt|snetram:  3 kier forsowaÅo do koÅcÃ³wki, wiÄc pas zaprasza do szlemika|pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: Gdyby @CAs by³ u W, by³by przymus...|pg||
nt|idc: Pity npc cannot throw in the towel as in a boxing match|pg||
nt|psridhar: bd6 didnt fetch a danish gain as i expected|pg||
mb|p|nt|ftpe: he will try ruff 2 di at hand|pg||
nt|lesh: the defence has to be careful|pg||
nt|babs59: Russia are in 6th place on 180 with France close behind on 178.  After that there's a bigger gap, Netherlands on 164...|pg||
mb|p|nt|eweber: in board 4 NL managed to win 4 by making 2@d, so 5:4 for them now|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Lebensohl or transfer Lebensohl. Transfer Lebensohl would show both monors|pg||
nt|peachy: even down 1, this be small gain for England|pg||
nt|peachy: and it could slip home|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Which is Jason and which is Justin?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ty|pg||
nt|chick: now very hard to make|pg||
nt|h_karluk: seems clubs hook needed|pg||
nt|snetram:  gdyby chciaÅ graÄ tylko 5 powinien sam licytowaÄ 5|pg||
nt|eamongall: and unfortunately in the not to distant future Eamon Galligans name will be mentioned in Ostend by the Ireland npc .... as I went for 2200 in Brighton as he whispered "donkey" ...|pg||
nt|eamongall: under his breath :):)|pg||
nt|j li: Gromöller hat einen Schlemmversuch gemacht, jetzt wird es schwierig, das Vollspiel zu erfüllen|pg||
pc|h2|nt|haans: ERROR|pg||
nt|haans: no @C8|pg||
nt|h_karluk: operator, undo please|pg||
nt|haans: not|pg||
nt|mcarroll: All one way traffic at the moment|pg||
nt|haans: better :)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yep|pg||
nt|ady: 2 minor suit aces to lose|pg||
nt|shevek: can't score a ruff on top of AK|pg||
nt|lesh: he didnt has the entry ,however the small spade gave it|pg||
nt|h_karluk: then ruff hearts and try devil's coup|pg||
nt|petergill: At least 8 tricks for NS, even on a trump switch|pg||
nt|oleberg: Like Zia says: When you have the @D9, PLAY IT|pg||
nt|j li: Gut den Karoangriff vermieden!|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|athene: the auction in the other room looks like an interesting twist on leaping michaels - you bid 4 of the minor you haven't got|pg||
nt|athene: that is perhaps sensible if you play the bids as forcing|pg||
nt|bagman: Thx all. I need to go now, see you again.|pg||
nt|bagman: bye|pg||
nt|santyclz: Thanks Pekka.|pg||
nt|athene: bye thanks|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: I think the irish fans need to start some serious prayers - its looking grim|pg||
nt|babs59: Netherlands, as host country, will have a place in the Bermuda Bowl field regardless|pg||
nt|bagman: If declarer guesses the clubs he has 9 tricks|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2@H = max without majors or four hearts.|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|eweber: quite many warm up boards so far|pg||
nt|haans: @HK good play|pg||
nt|chick: really?|pg||
nt|babs59: Belgium is hosting the selection event, but I thought 2011 Bermuda Bowl etc slated for Netherlands?|pg||
nt|bagman: IF not, he might have time to establish the diamonds|pg||
nt|andreasw:  why board 8 here?|pg||
nt|bagman: If declarer loses a club trick to South, he returns a heart. West's spots are good enough to stop defense from taking 3 heart tricks|pg||
nt|andreasw:  he will take it with q and finesse clubs|pg||
nt|odysseus69: but gets there in the end|pg||
nt|athene: now his problem is how to hold his losers to two hearts and one spade|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|collins64: @s to the J and it's over|pg||
nt|wygbe1: that lead may allow it to slip home|pg||
nt|andreasw:  so 11 trick's:)|pg||
nt|shevek: yes|pg||
nt|MolvaM: it seems the 5-5 minor gadget worked for the wales pair|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 3nt could well go down on spade lead|pg||
nt|udo: treffame wird wohl die Schlüsselkarte,,,und nach dieser reizung...|pg||
nt|riccho: Zumal wenn das 3er@s bei N bekannt wird|pg||
nt|udo: wennman allerdings bei Nord ein paar @h s und 3 Trümpfe erfährt.....|pg||
nt|idc: tricky - declarer would like to win this in dummy to take @h finesse|pg||
pc|s2|nt|ryskiel_: gdyby @C as by³ u W  moze by go ci¹gn¹³?|pg||

nt|jkotor: wczoraj widzielimy otwarcie Kality 1@s na "piêkne 10" i 5431|pg||
nt|james_h: Well, Ireland needed VPs badly and action was needed|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 9@D   a not bad play he will make 9 tricks |pg||
nt|oleberg: Yes, the defence has to play something|pg||
nt|odysseus69: hoping that defence will get stuck into diamonds or even spades|pg||
nt|babs59: has it changed?|pg||
nt|j li: Man wird die Gegnerhände auszählen können bis auf eine UF-Karte|pg||
pc|s4|nt|athene: it looks at first as though declarer might be able to hold his losers to two trumps from here, if he guesses right, but there's just too much work to do, i suppose|pg||
nt|lesh: well the declarer didnt want to take advantage|pg||
nt|chick: hehe|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Versace will not fall for this|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/Events/ebl/2010ostend/default.asp  for convention cards and other useful information|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|star6ija: 12 tricks may be taken now|pg||
nt|haans: @S7 count even|pg||
nt|bagman: This solves the spade guess as the the @DJ can be used to discard the spade|pg||
nt|bagman: His only option for 4 club trikcs is Kx N|pg||
nt|athene: @CA, @DAK throwing club, then duck a heart i suppose|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|paulhac:  This looks like the only lead to give the contract|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Thanks Paul|pg||
nt|paulhac:  We think Justin is East|pg||
nt|haans: all cards from for Austria but no score i believe|pg||
nt|shevek: not if declarer ducks once?|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes he sould still go down|pg||
nt|andreasw:  would*|pg||
nt|justin c: only needs the @SK or the @DK right|pg||
nt|james_h: but the teams fate is sealed I fear|pg||
nt|oleberg: Leading towards the @DK can be done later|pg||
nt|udo: ist sie ( hoffentlich aus parteiischer Sicht) findbar:)|pg||
nt|j li: Der Gegner hat sie gefunden|pg||
nt|riccho: Ah... man will mit seinem Trumpfstich Schnapper machen... |pg||
nt|motu: das nachspiel hat geholfen|pg||
nt|j li: Jetzt muss Gro die Trümpfe finden|pg||
pc|c9|nt|jameslee 2: he can make 4@C+2@H+2@S= 8 tricks  |pg||
nt|ozgull: son üç bordun hepsi bize iyi|pg||
nt|j li: Einfacher Schnitt, oder Trumpfas, Trumpf nach?|pg||
nt|idc: but that uses up his only sure entry if he plans to try @s finesse later|pg||
pc|c4|nt|ryskiel_: i nast¹pi³o oddanie zapisu i strata|pg||
nt|odysseus69: wrong again- |pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's in the Netherlands alright, nothing has changed|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Top 6 + NL will qualify from all 3 categories|pg||
nt|andreasw:  well, only on entrance |pg||
nt|corplaw: think starting on clubs was better to create another entry to W's hand|pg||
nt|corplaw: now a heart return and spade back strands hand in dummy|pg||
nt|corplaw: or 10S return as well|pg||
nt|ady: Israel gained 2 imps on hand 5  going down 1 in 3@S|pg||
pc|c5|nt|ziff:  We can see that the contract is cold, but declarer can see only 8 tricks|pg||
nt|athene: ok, this is just doing his work for him|pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: Graja 3 Dzwonki|pg||
nt|bagman: Anyhow, the non-spade lead indicates the @SA|pg||
nt|barnets: low heart to the 8|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|brolucius: Good point.|pg||
nt|bagman: With trumps breaking the declarer has an easy claim|pg||
nt|bagman: West needs to win this|pg||
pc|sT|nt|rigas_karo: nothing else here i think, @s to the K and claim|pg||
nt|collins64: yes West need to lead A@h to beat the contract|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: there is nothing he can do if @s are 4-1|pg||
nt|lechcold: to wietnie:) nie doceni³em Grzegorza..bardzo siê cieszê bo 3@D chyba wygraj¹ bez problemu|pg||
nt|8252: N S peuvent scorer 140 la dessus, si on passe la bonne à @h, et à @c|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: K@D the 9 th trick|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: wd South|pg||
nt|athene: well finesse a heart|pg||
nt|dburn: not easy to find a diamond shift, but he doesn't need to|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jkotor: na oko odda pika i 2kara|pg||
nt|andreasw:  no Ace finesse clubs |pg||
nt|sastro: Plan ist klar- Ost soll auf Pik-Schnitt verzichten und N bekommt noch nen Schnapper wenn Partner @H -König hält|pg||
nt|riccho: hmm|pg||
pc|s8|nt|brolucius: Declarer would have had time to set up the clubs after a heart lead from West.|pg||
nt|tomi2:  for me it is quite impressive how many teams did not bid the grand in 6 till now|pg||
nt|bagman: Now the defense has 2 heart tricks ready|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|tomi2:  bulgaria in 5@D, Norway in 6@D|pg||
nt|othered1: east doesn'thave the most comfortable of pitches|pg||
nt|jkotor: szczególnie po pikowym|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|lesh: going down now|pg||
nt|odysseus69: think hes home now unless defence finds spade switch|pg||
nt|riccho: @sK stellt sicher, dass der Gegner es richtig macht|pg||
nt|psridhar: with dia ace doubleton he will get another entry now|pg||
pc|s5|nt|boyklas: claim|pg||
nt|lmeili: pretty safe to win @hA if the lead from 4th, set up a @d trick as 9th |pg||
nt|xenya: 9 tricks now on a cross ruff|pg||
nt|chick: so a grosvenor duck by N sets this :)|pg||
nt|petergill: My job was to photograph the Swedish girls for the Bulletin after their win in Piestany. Cecilia said "Please wait until I make myself look better." I thought that was impossible. ...|pg||
nt|petergill: I will see if I can show find the photo for you|pg||
nt|odysseus69: no - defence still ok as long as not club|pg||
nt|barnets: a decs problem is the heart suit|pg||
pc|sK|nt|athene: spade force looked the natural play - perhaps Duboin was worried about forcing declarer too much and helping him into a trump coup against north's known heart length|pg||
nt|haans: Fallenius do not like it :(|pg||
nt|psridhar: Fredin must be ruing his decision to upgrade his hand to 1NT opening|pg||
nt|lechcold: -2 siê szykuje tutaj|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|boyklas: i think its not reasonable to lead the AH|pg||
nt|collins64: for sure|pg||
nt|ftpe: solid play|pg||
nt|idc: a reasonable compromise - even if @d don't behave, they will provide some tricks and he keeps communications better|pg||
pc|s6|nt|rigas_karo: certainly not!|pg||
nt|haans: flat|pg||
nt|petergill: All four are in their (mid) twenties at this table. |pg||
nt|oleberg: I thought he might have played his heart|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: spec asked me if spain will play Argentine after quater-finals ???|pg||
nt|odysseus69: all over now|pg||
nt|dburn: or at least, not to beat the contract - this defence will lead to two down rather than three|pg||
nt|yuval10: his only chance seem to be 3-3 in both blacks + A@d with S for a throw-in|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Poland are up by 4 now against Germany, and only 3 VPs behind Italy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Exciting finish|pg||
nt|yuval10: indeed|pg||
nt|brolucius: And this board will not assist Italy.|pg||
nt|yuval10: 4@h is going down in the OR as well ( board 7 )|pg||
nt|odysseus69: h 9 best|pg||
nt|dburn: well, a diamond will probably have the same effect|pg||
nt|dburn: the trouble is, as far as I can tell, that North does not know the heart position|pg||
nt|odysseus69: yes anything but a club|pg||
nt|dburn: the lead was attitude, so South could have five hearts or six; 2@h showed a maximum with no major or any hand with four hearts, so Lauria could have three hearts or four|pg||
nt|davidb: partner led the 2  attitude -should know|pg||
pc|d3|nt|tomi2:  San Marino should agree on their 2/1 follow ups too, 3@D was not a great score|pg||
nt|udo: jetzt schauts doch ganz gut aus:))|pg||
nt|psridhar: now he can make an overtrick on the major suit squeeze|pg||
pc|d7|nt|udo: 5 imps italy in board 5,,,NS bid on to 5 @S ,,against the probably making 5@C|pg||

nt|vugraphzng: I see that on the rama but no idea on the subject|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: maybe on the slow playing|pg||
nt|tomi2:  yeaterday Nerherlands - Russia was scored as 18-2 VP because of 5 VP for each team|pg||
nt|lmeili: because of slow play?|pg||
nt|tomi2:  yes, as far as I know|pg||
nt|lmeili: that was a heavy penalty!|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: If I have good information they finish 20 minutes late in that match|pg||
nt|tomi2:  10 VP for 20 minutes? thats a lot|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: restarting here|pg||
nt|athene: which means duboin can't have had a count on the diamonds - if he knew declarer had four he would have bashed out that @S10 like a shot|pg||
nt|athene: the standard counter to a 2-suiter being to force declarer|pg||
nt|andreasw:  then a @d to ace and a @s back |pg||
nt|haans: yes dirty upscore|pg||
nt|psridhar: might hv worked on some other layout |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: yes 800 always dangerous|pg||

nt|h_karluk: 5@c/@d ok|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: the @D was abit of desperation ... if left to her (i'm told) own devices declarer will have to gess is it @dKxx or @dKx|pg||
nt|cumino: May be board 6 is a bit delicate if EST opens 1S|pg||
nt|riccho: Gar nicht so einfach immer die brettharte defense zu finden... wie man hier sehen kann|pg||
nt|psridhar: the NS here sem to play a simple std system, but the OPEN denmark tean that i played against twice play very complicated system|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You are correct|pg||

nt|psridhar: abnormally complex but youngsters remember everything|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and France doing well too and have closed the gap to Denmark for 3rd|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Still two matches after this, much can happen|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In the next round all our matches are from the open series|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Italy v Israel and Poland v Germany are crucial|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In the seniors' event, Poland has now overtaken Italy. The Italians had a healthy lead going into today's play, but they lost 10-20 against Denmark in the morning match. The ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: seniors have another round after this|pg||

nt|ady: partial here in spades   Ireland need to keep low|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes may well get too high|pg||
nt|psridhar: Fredin will briefly consider 3nt b4 bidding 4s when he finds out his pd has unbal hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: There was no follow-up to discuss. North jumped to 3@D, South thought it was a WJS and passed|pg||
nt|cumino: 1NT|pg||
nt|barnets: imagine east had QJxx in hearts|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Gerben42: apparently the rooms are connected now|pg||
nt|Gerben42: white vs red NS are very agressive, but as we have seen vuln. they are middle of the road|pg||
nt|eweber: 3@s is not exactly what you'd dream of with the South hand...|pg||
nt|Gerben42: best to not dream but pass with a happy face|pg||
nt|eweber: I assume West is the one who is taking his time here|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Great to see the Irish at the top of the leader board|pg||
nt|josj: as far as I know, they were about 30 mins. late and were eventually fined 3 VP each|pg||
nt|tomi2:  getting informed that they got 3 VP back each|pg||
nt|tomi2:  thx|pg||
nt|athene: ok :)|pg||
nt|aldek: England on the board|pg||
nt|andreasw:  @d to king and alot of @s trick's|pg||
nt|shevek: south can only get in once (@dK)|pg||
nt|ftpe: that opening will probably bring them to 6 spades|pg||
nt|xenya: on 7, the Estonian EW in the other room got to 4@H -- not a bad contract really, but down on foul trump split -- 1 down and 7 imps to Russia|pg||
nt|ftpe: in 6 spades he has to guess spade queen, but best chance is playing on sp 2-2|pg||
nt|haans: 10-13|pg||
nt|lechcold: 54 impy w 8 rozdaniach|pg||
nt|yuval10: will they reach slam here?|pg||
nt|dburn: here is a slam - not in the Roland category either|pg||
mb|3H|nt|mcarroll: Unfortunate lie of the cards, but will be the same in the other room  one assumes|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hmmm?|pg||
nt|athene: my guess is they put the board on the table upside down|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hand reversed?|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: ty vugragher |pg||
nt|oleberg: Well, if you play Ghana in football, I guess a black squeeze is possible|pg||
nt|barnets: then dec still had a loser|pg||
nt|jkotor: 5@c made board 4 after K@h lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Too good for me|pg||
mb|4H|nt|boyklas: FG raise with D?|pg||
nt|boyklas: or 14+ Bal?|pg||
nt|haans: that 1@S overcall???|pg||
nt|xenya: i don't think 6@S is such a great contract -- problems in spades and diamonds|pg||
nt|ftpe: agree, but they will get there after ligth open, |pg||
nt|xenya: well the 3@H bid makes it easier to solve the spade problem|pg||
nt|haans: Fredit pass??????|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Thanks Udo|pg||

nt|suketbombi: 3nt  by NS likely to fail as nothing works for the 9th trick however 5@C is a great contract and aMake|pg||
nt|suketbombi: @@@S pd bid on if @H is ur suit|pg||
nt|ady: 2@D  multi     2@S   shows good heart support   but sign of for spades|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 2@S|pg||

nt|boyklas: with the AH in his place|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: difficult decision for South here|pg||
nt|andersk: 3 NT?|pg||
nt|peachy: operator doing great job, keeping up with the fairly fast pace at the table|pg||

nt|udo: i will send u an E-Mail, david|pg||
nt|brolucius: Thx.|pg||
nt|lesh: what might appeared to be a sacrifice for N/S it will be a makable game :)|pg||

nt|lesh: they need to find @c support|pg||
nt|lesh: 1@d has to be alerted I think|pg||
nt|lesh: they play prec :)|pg||
nt|ady: south might compete with 3@C    but not clear action|pg||
nt|Walddk12: Kokish?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Starting in 1½ hours|pg||
mb|p|nt|rigas_karo: it is safe to bid once again but |pg||
nt|rnmalik: very tempting:)|pg||
nt|mamos: good pressure from South|pg||
nt|othered1: Bye, Udo.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i choose 3@h cue here|pg||
nt|chick: right, 3@C is a better bid|pg||
nt|lechcold: basketball|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: ahh true|pg||
mb|p|nt|collins64: if Mike bid 4@d, Isabelle 4@h they'll play 6@d|pg||
nt|eweber: if anyone of the players|pg||
nt|yuval10: not everyone's X perhaps|pg||
nt|ady: this might cause Irland to get too high|pg||
nt|jkotor: jak w dobrych juniorskich czasach :)|pg||

nt|suketbombi: 3@D is Rubinsol trf to @Hs i Suppose|pg||
nt|odysseus69: surprising|pg||
mb|p|nt|rigas_karo: 4@d or 4NT?|pg||
nt|roswolf: the boards have been swingy - Italy - slovakia 46-0 after 4 boards shows how|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Vul, not for the fainthearted!|pg||
nt|mamos: at least a couple off|pg||
nt|cameron_1: but flat vs. 3@s so|pg||
nt|cameron_1: flatish|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes but N takes the firsst @D trick|pg||
nt|MolvaM: good stop|pg||
nt|andreasw:  first|pg||
nt|xenya: no slam now -- just collecting your money i think...|pg||
nt|lechcold: 2BA naci¹gane|pg||
nt|james_h: Penos in South Africa ...|pg||
nt|oleberg: 2@H = 3 spades and a good raise. Normally not a gameforcing hand|pg||
nt|funtay: 6. brd 13 bize:)|pg||
pc|hT|nt|andersk: opps|pg||
nt|andersk: cold 4 @H|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 4@H +1|pg||
nt|athene: not sure i like unusual 2nt with 6@D4@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: :)|pg||
nt|athene: partner usually bids clubs with equal length which isn't at all what you want|pg||
nt|athene: notice how south can't bid stayman intending 2@S (sign-off) over 2@D|pg||
nt|athene: they obviously play that as something cunning|pg||
nt|athene: we have seen they have lots of relay auctions after stayman so you do lose the ability to bid it on rubbish hands|pg||
nt|shevek: 8 declarer made 3N and 8 went down|pg||
nt|shevek: declarers|pg||
nt|MolvaM: so it must have been a 50% contract :)|pg||
nt|shevek: true, needs accurate defence|pg||
nt|shevek: lol  murat|pg||
nt|xenya: or... who knows?|pg||
nt|lesh: he has to guess Q@d now, but it is difficult and probably -2|pg||
nt|hawe45:  300 avec le bon flanc - mais tout normale|pg||
nt|mdgraham: understandable auction, but the cards do not lie well|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: Ole I would love to play Ghana tat would mean we are in the final :)|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 2@H = is new for me nice |pg||
nt|oleberg: "To play Ghana" sounds like something that could be illegal (or prohibited to minors)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: coffee time|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A very sound contract on this lie|pg||
nt|mdgraham: heavy 1NT overcall, but you don't really want to pass at this vulnerability|pg||
nt|yusufb: 6 bordda 53 imp baya fazla|pg||
nt|ozgull: eller ona uygun tüm maçlar imp kaynýyor|pg||
nt|corplaw: easy 3N|pg||
nt|skaftij:  likely 10 imps to Iceland|pg||
nt|Walddk12: Glaub ich schon|pg||
nt|j li: 2@H zeigt 19-20 ausgeglichen|pg||
nt|athene: no @S switch?|pg||
nt|jkotor: @d|pg||
nt|dburn: but that 3@h overcall took away just enough space|pg||
nt|yuval10: AK A and 4@s ?|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|pitiful:  some play middle encourages and high or low sp in this situation|pg||
nt|shevek: to be fair some went down in 6@d :)|pg||
nt|petergill: Found it http://www.worldbridge1.org/bulletin/06_2%20Piestany/pdf/pairs/bul_04.pdf there are 2 photos of Cecilia. Interesting that the Poles who ran 2nd to them in the 2006 World ...|pg||
nt|petergill: Junior Pairs are near the top of the datums in the Open here in Ostend|pg||
nt|ralfwil: was N opening 1@h? 5+ |pg||
nt|skaftij:  Haraldsson opened 15-17 NT in 4th seat on his good 14 count|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|collins64: he made the wrong choice|pg||
nt|boyklas: all the problems comes here for S because he doesnt know the H or the C Quebid|pg||
nt|boyklas: and he make go down even a 5D|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: at least the did well to avoid 6NT :)|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: 5@d by North is safe|pg||
nt|collins64: Belgium is back after the previous deal|pg||
nt|collins64: Dehaye weak NT forced them to play 4@h for one down|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: very weak NT :)|pg||
nt|boyklas: Manolis choosed to play at the 5-3 fit and not at the 4-4, firstly was thinking that he is playing at th 5-4 fit|pg||
nt|collins64: the bidding was 1NT 8-11 Pass 3@c X and he bid 4@h with his 5-card Q@h and his 4-card 8@s|pg||
nt|ady: they might make this  getting 3 diamond tricks|pg||
nt|lesh: A@s and @d switch|pg||
nt|h_karluk: straightforward play also possible|pg||
nt|chick: against the odds to drop the @DQ, but W may lead trump now to protect against a spade ruff|pg||
nt|barnets: Hacketts stopped in 4@S|pg||
nt|bagman: The hands do not fit well|pg||
nt|barnets: after a couple of slam tries|pg||
nt|barnets: on board 6|pg||
nt|brolucius: Countries in certain parts of the globe get a 'free pass' into the Bermuda Bowl. It is much more difficult if you are a European country.|pg||

pc|c4|nt|rigas_karo: strange|pg||

nt|star6ija: 8+points, 5+@hs|pg||
nt|chick: OR, E could make a brilliant overtake of the spades and lead a trump :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: if ther declarer decided to play straightforward that doesn't make a sense|pg||

nt|mcarroll: Although playing safe after the double 4 is the probable outcome|pg||

nt|brolucius: Some work to do, for 12 tricks. I don't know that I would expect them to bid 6@S on those values.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|rnmalik: Possibility only if declarer guesses the entry to W hand.|pg||
nt|athene: Mari shamefacedly trying to shift some diamonds in with his clubs, courtesy of a black pen|pg||
nt|brolucius: Speculative double from East.|pg||
nt|othered1: Their doubles show extras, I believe.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They prefer to use double for something else. One can survive without support doubles you know|pg||
nt|tomi2:  eas has @CAQ in their opened suit, @DA, @SQ and partner made a constructive call vulnerable|pg||

nt|odysseus69: time to relax and watch second set tie-break|pg||
nt|barnets: thanks victor|pg||
nt|yuval10: they might reach 6 here|pg||
nt|dburn: to Dutch football supporters, I should say that I was delighted when the Netherlands won, except that it generated a lot of noise in the hotel room below mine where I was trying to ...|pg||
nt|dburn: do some work|pg||
mb|4C|nt|eweber: this may have been another 2 Imps for NL|pg||
nt|athene: just because opps don't have game values between them doesn't mean they can't crucify you at the 3-level|pg||
nt|lesh: an easy -1 |pg||
nt|koksoy: 2@H de  kalacagýz|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: poles toughts us this|pg||
nt|pitiful:  not many would not want to show that @h suit|pg||
nt|xenya: but pass by S looks clear now|pg||
nt|brolucius: Attitude leads against NT, so the low club shows a suit that will be worth pursuing.|pg||
nt|othered1: would south have taken the same line without the double, which pretty strongly put the @CQ offside?.|pg||
nt|lesh: @c switch is not that difficult|pg||
nt|lesh: or playing small :)|pg||
nt|justin c: several of them, truth to tell|pg||
nt|brolucius: Oh, they play it as limited. Well, David Greenwood told me a few days ago that he treats it as 99% forcing. |pg||
nt|Walddk2: grey-ish rather|pg||
nt|odysseus69: there is a law in Scotland known as Leckies Law - if opponents are happy to defend 1D on this auction - GET OUT|pg||
nt|yusufb: 2@d 2@h diyen elin iyisi|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 3@C is pretty ok here 2@S a@D and a@C to loose|pg||
nt|ady: yes    Israel have competed well|pg||
nt|riccho: Andreas kennt aber auch Gro und weiß, dass die 4er UF noch nicht in Stein festgemeißelt ist|pg||
nt|yuval10: 3NT serious?|pg||
mb|4D|nt|babs59: What did you do to them Roland?|pg||
nt|bagman: The auction looks like Puppet Stayman 3@D promising one major and 3@H promising spades|pg||
nt|barnets: in usa espn are showing the match we are on the first set game 6|pg||
nt|yuval10: you may wonder|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: 1H showed spades|pg||
nt|ziff:  This could be tricky...|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2@H presumably forcing to game, so 3@H is not limited.|pg||
nt|dburn: perhaps - this is another not-so-great-but-playable slam|pg||
mb|4N|nt|boyklas: long suit game try, and accept with 4-3-3-3|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 1S is transfer to 1NT perhaps|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|pitiful:  maybe 4@h would not be natural for n-s|pg||
nt|aldek: nastepna glupota Brinka, ale ta przezyl|pg||
nt|james_h: I'm hoping for 6@d |pg||
nt|james_h: I could 6n|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: this is rigid once the @CQ pops declarer will be happy|pg||
nt|petergill: so 1NT rebid 15-17 and 2@D GF checkback with 2@H = three hearts|pg||
nt|mdgraham: East getting the character of her hand across with 1NT. Not much of a diamond stop, but anything else would be a distortion  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: painted them, perhaps?|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer has 9 top tricks in high cards and all suits stopped. He should play diamonds for 5 tricks|pg||
nt|serhat: bu turnuvayi yapacaklar.. 4 takým cýracaklar.. oynasýnlar sabaha kadar kazanan milli takým olsun|pg||
mb|5D|nt|santyclz: It's particularly unsafe to balance when the opponents haven't shown a fit.|pg||
nt|tomi2:  I am just thinking about how the play went, if GromÃ¶ller ducked @DA two times|pg||
nt|hawe45:  moins un|pg||
nt|justin c: either @C in West, or @H3-3,or @HJx etc|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: do not believe in 4@S|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 3NT, 5@C,2@D, 2@S losing 4 @H|pg||
nt|pitiful:  I am informed possibly a slam try in @s|pg||
nt|jkotor: jeli graj¹ otwarcie 4@s na -3 to tu tylko lewa wiêcej|pg||

nt|ryskiel_: jakby licytacja potoczy³a sie inaczej mogliby zagaræ 6|pg||
nt|barnets: west has to avoid leading his long suit V 3N|pg||
nt|brolucius: They are certainly bidding round the houses. Let's hope that they end in the right place.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: eventually 3NT|pg||
nt|idc: We only have 1 page of the Italian's CC, so can't tell you what the 3@c - 3@h bit meant|pg||
nt|psridhar: an armchair ride the play, overtricks|pg||
nt|brolucius: Indeed.|pg||
mb|6H|nt|rigas_karo: this is not making...|pg||
nt|petergill: Susan Stockdale is very disciplined about taking her time at Trick 1 to study the hand fully before committing herself to any play|pg||
nt|petergill: This is a very good habit to have|pg||
nt|barnets: r he gives dec his 9th trick|pg||
nt|andreasw:  He will|pg||
nt|bagman: Instead of playing diamond to ace and 8 back with intention to run it|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: relays flipping out|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: good bridge by both teams |pg||
nt|justin c: very good contract|pg||
nt|koksoy: ortak  oyun  actýktan  sonra  ovecall  geldigi  zaman  cok  konvansiyon  oynanýyor|pg||

nt|yusufb: major oyun acýþýna ve major araya giriþine x gelirse transfer oynayan cok cift var|pg||
nt|dburn: and maybe they will bid it, but the lack of @hQ and an ace may deter them, but...|pg||
nt|serhat: sorry|pg||
mb|p|nt|wygbe1: could have held it to 2 with 3 rounds of diamonds , for uppercut promoting a second trump trick, but cant beat it|pg||
nt|star6ija: running scores for this round and this group at http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/runningscores/asp/roundteamsconditstatclassicmod.asp?qtournid=819&qshowflag=1|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzng: it seems east played 2 spade on same time here, director explain what to do|pg||
nt|tomi2:  Wladow revoked?|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 3/2 a litle move by Sweden |pg||
nt|brolucius: When you need 25 VPs, anything goes.|pg||
nt|dburn: ...that 5@d response hasn't left room to ask about @hQ, so Ilan bid it anyway|pg||
nt|dburn: @hQ will oblige, but the clubs won't - this is not going to be easy|pg||
nt|odysseus69: all he has to do is make it|pg||
pc|c6|nt|jameslee 2: let,s se how the 800 finishes starting bidding of the hand other room|pg||
nt|marlowepi: heureusement pour Mari, E peut contribuer la dame de K, sinon entame K serait peu confortable|pg||
nt|brolucius: Obvious what to lead after that bidding...|pg||
nt|barnets: anyone living in usa should write and comlain to espn|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He can make it if he plays on spades but why would he|pg||
nt|dburn: if he wins this in his hand, draws trumps and plays a spade to the queen he can make it, but that looks anti-percentage|pg||
nt|yuval10: no reason to do that indeed|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That would be double dummy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Defect of no 1430 got them to slam a distinguished spectator points out|pg||
nt|davidb: now difficult .on A D he would make it . trumps(4) , KQ club & sp finesse  when club do not break |pg||
nt|brolucius: May still get 1430, though.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is a textbook example of why 1430 is superior. 1 keycard is a common response|pg||
nt|yuval10: 5@h OR|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And you are in trouble with 0314 when hearts are trump|pg||
nt|yuval10: so a big swing here for either side|pg||
nt|odysseus69: best line is to lean to the left and have a peep at East cards- otherwise it would be a miracle to make this|pg||
nt|dburn: the German declarer in the match against Poland made it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Draw trumps, KQ@C, @S to Q A@S ruff @S @C to A claim. Yes, but is that a normal line?|pg||
nt|dburn: to retake the lead and give Italy more breathing space|pg||
pc|c3|nt|Walddk12: It wasn't for the Italians after the same start. Bocchi bid 4@H, 5@D by Madala and 6@H|pg||
nt|barnets: a diamond ?|pg||
nt|cumino: Diamond beats |pg||
nt|bagman: Madala's going to lead a spade and Bocchi's going to play the @SQ|pg||
nt|koksoy: burada  @H  overcallundan  sonra   dbl=  en az  4 tane  pik  demek....  1S  deseydi  =  cevap  verecek  kadar puan va ancak  4lü  pik  yok  demekti|pg||
pc|cT|nt|boyklas: if he had not take the D he would have made it|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: double @C finesse is 75% or so - playing on hearts is 36% 3/3 or 50% abit better if u cash the @HA ... so claerly clubs best line|pg||
nt|odysseus69: need to know what they said about 3S bid|pg||
nt|barnets: wow amazing|pg||
nt|bagman: well done by Madala|pg||
nt|brolucius: Too good.|pg||
nt|bagman: Might 3@S mean solid spade stopper and not so solid diamond stopper?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: I suspect that 3 spades showed good stop|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|j li: Die Gegenspieler sind zu scharf auf ihre Schnapper|pg||
nt|dburn: but they led the ace of diamonds against him, so he did not need so much of a miracle|pg||
nt|davidb: after D A  it is the right play  |pg||
nt|odysseus69: Simon Cope insists that he should make|pg||
nt|dburn: I guess declarer may try the same thing here, but the lead has given him the possibility that East and not West has the club singleton|pg||
pc|h4|nt|haans: :(|pg||
nt|petergill: I lost to Fiona and Susan at the NEC Cup in Japan earlier this year - I know their style quite well|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Gold must have showed concern about either diamonds or spades|pg||
nt|bagman: Now unlikely to try to steal the @SK|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|andersk: many tables have been playing 4@HX +1 for 990 on  9|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: 50% inteding to finesse the @ht|pg||
nt|justin c: guess you run the @CJ, and if that loses test @H, and if nothing good there, run the @C10|pg||
nt|riccho: hab ich auch grad dran gedacht|pg||
pc|hK|nt|collins64: other Room 3NT on deal 9|pg||
nt|andersk: maybe South switch small @D|pg||
nt|ziff:  If I understood our operator right he played two cards to the same trick|pg||
nt|MolvaM: maybe ducking would have been better|pg||
nt|barnets: murray won set 2|pg||
nt|brolucius: Perhaps a quicker auction would have given fewer clues.|pg||
nt|motu: karo nach sollte noch reichen|pg||
nt|dburn: so that he can pick up clubs the "normal" way by finessing against West|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|lmeili: do u like N's "double" ? here|pg||
nt|haans: no @D loser|pg||
nt|dburn: however, he won't be inclined to play East for two singletons now, so maybe after all...|pg||
pc|d9|nt|rigas_karo: i think only 8 tricks even if the ducks the @d|pg||
nt|wygbe1: i need to go, its late here - thx all, gnite, enjoy the match|pg||
nt|athene: well a boring 4major+1 is just what EW need to get back on track after that last board|pg||
nt|fokal: indeed|pg||
nt|dburn: ...it's not so far-fetched to draw trumps, cash @cQ and play on spades|pg||
pc|d2|nt|collins64: after 1@d 2@d |pg||
nt|Walddk2: What is West supposed to do, Victor, redouble?|pg||
nt|suketbombi: Zack has taken that gamble as 3@C cud have come with 5 cards too|pg||
nt|barnets: the brasil holland game is just starting|pg||
nt|dburn: but this, hoping to guess diamonds or ruff one in the dummy on a normal club break also looks reasonable|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|rnmalik: After the first @H you mean.|pg||
nt|peachy: Thanks Jim, enjoyed! G nite|pg||
nt|star6ija: happyend|pg||
nt|brolucius: Will need to look at that one again, Thomas. You are right that he needs to get to the South hand to draw the last trump and a diamond hold-up may be helpful.|pg||
nt|tomi2:  then duck the club later|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 1 set all - murrayv Tsonga|pg||
nt|riccho: haarscharf das Ganze. |pg||
pc|c8|nt|mcarroll: Surely not|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I mean not playing @SQ?|pg||
nt|haans: Operator Who are the swedish players?|pg||
nt|haans: 2nd opinion: Peacokk: E upmark|pg||
nt|haans: @H5|pg||
pc|c7|nt|tomi2:  had no other intelligent bid|pg||
nt|mdgraham: may be out for 800 - not so bad with 4@H on NS|pg||
nt|yusufb: kendi rengimize transfer etmek burdaki 2@d gibi|pg||
nt|j li: es droht ein dritter Trumpfstich für die Defense|pg||
nt|dburn: though a spade continuation would be awkward, I guess|pg||
pc|h6|nt|boyklas: yes sorry|pg||
nt|tokay1975: he made  insurance   with 5 card suit and 14 count against 10or 11 bad |pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Goodnight Jim|pg||
nt|bagman: Now Madala knows how to defend with the setting trick in his own hand|pg||
nt|babs59: East is relieved to get the spade trick, bonus|pg||
nt|odysseus69: yes xx on this - pass not allowed |pg||
nt|idc: Poland up to a maximum 25 VPs now, so gap at the top between them & Italy only 2 VPs|pg||
nt|brolucius: So, distant visions of the gold medal recede over the horizon.|pg||
mc|11|nt|haans: sloppy|pg||
nt|tomi2:  maybe he can make versace believe @CQ is onside and use spade as entry to hand|pg||
nt|tomi2:  but versace had @CT8, so he could have played the clubs starting with the 8 then without losing communication|pg||
nt|brolucius: Worth another look, you are right. Easier on Deep Finesse.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If S had followed with @hQ on @hK.....|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer still has only 7 tricks ready made|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Pekka I thnk you called it right|pg||
nt|barnets: actually that was live but the tennis is not|pg||
nt|psridhar: Italy is yet to get off the schenider even after half the match, admittedly the danish competition has been fierce|pg||

nt|petergill: West cannot get East in|pg||
nt|petergill: North's jamming 4@H call was a good bid, convincing EW not to try 4@S|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed, especially since 4@s would actually make on a heart lead|pg||
nt|petergill: With NS playing a limited opening system (11H 11-16), 4@H might also have been bid on a balanced 14 count, making 4@S by East quite dangerous|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@H 11-16|pg||

nt|marlowepi: un bon contrat|pg||
pc|c2|nt|rnmalik: The contract I mean.|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: that's what I got from thr CR|pg||
nt|athene: if east suspects the 1@H is a psyche he can't be so sure about the diamond finesse|pg||
nt|shevek: I would pass every time|pg||
nt|brolucius: One heart loser goes on the @CA, so slam depends on picking up the trump. But no reason to think they will bid it.|pg||

nt|othered1: EW's card mentions "distributional asking relays," which may be in effect here.|pg||
nt|8252: oui, mais c'est les même levées à SA|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: board 10 North by not openning lost a @S = part score contract|pg||
nt|riccho: @s besser duecken im 1. Stich?|pg||
pc|cK|nt|boyklas: he may play well the S, if he play small to the A and see the KS drops he can play small to T now the JXX cant be played|pg||

pc|c3|pg||

pc|d8|nt|star6ija: well done|pg||
nt|justin c: lol|pg||
nt|suketbombi: good play against 4@H there defence can prevail|pg||
nt|ady: playing for K10 spades onside  and good split|pg||
pc|d2|nt|Gerben42: making many tricks|pg||
nt|shevek: at least!  :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: You might not get a heart lead.|pg||
nt|othered1: and east's cheapest bid style h ere surely looks like a relay auction.  Don't have translation,  however.|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 4@C= 10 tricks |pg||
nt|j li: egal, da Kirmse zwei Asse hat|pg||
nt|idc: But I think the West hand is just too weak, and the singleton @d is a turn off|pg||
nt|Walddk2: On board 9 where Cedolin played well to make his 2@S, Magnussen in the other room made an overtrick|pg||
pc|dK|nt|pitiful:  still if he did he would probably be on lead to 4@s anyway|pg||
nt|pitiful:  Gold would open Rolands favourite flannery|pg||
nt|mamos: yes there are two "f" words we mustnt mention this week|pg||

nt|eamongall: I remember terraneo also in some large book about championship bridge |pg||
nt|james_h: Lets not lose hope, see if we can keep it to 5-25 or better|pg||
nt|oleberg: South might have opened too, on board 10|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: @H brake 3/3 will help him to get home|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @sA onside and @h not worse than 4-2 is enough|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: true clubs 2/2 helps but with clubs 3/1 also gets there with a @H play first|pg||
nt|idc: Even if North leads a low @h, with the West hand entryless and @h blocked, I'm not sre 3NT makes|pg||
pc|d9|nt|tomi2:  I guess west showed 4 3 2 4 :)|pg||

nt|suketbombi: there is not much hope here for declerer|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|hawe45:  Carefully played to discard a @H|pg||
nt|cameron_1: are you sure?|pg||
nt|mamos: South holding @HK makes it morelikely that North has @sK   but still needs to finesse 10|pg||
nt|othered1: But NS will  have an exact description of west hand and west will be declarer so @H lead very likely from both sides.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Well done to bid it!|pg||
nt|tomi2:  lauria will lead @HK with his likely trump trick|pg||
nt|bagman: In every case E has quite a minimum|pg||
nt|bagman: North might be wondering if the weakness is compensated by singleton spade|pg||
nt|ady: israel down 2 in 4@H   hand 9     first spade was ducked|pg||
pc|c5|nt|pitiful:  that was just to see how many messages I would get :)|pg||
nt|pitiful:  quite a few|pg||
nt|pitiful:  ...|pg||
nt|mamos: i think you should stick to Bridge Peter|pg||
nt|pitiful:  and no I do not play for Spurs|pg||
nt|pitiful:  perhaps I need to put that in my profile|pg||
nt|dburn: his problem is that he thinks (from the opening bid) that North has the ace of clubs|pg||
nt|pitiful:  this is very tough for TT|pg||
nt|pitiful:  DG sorry|pg||
nt|dburn: in which case he needs to cater for the possibility that North will play the fourth round of diamonds|pg||
nt|dburn: so perhaps he will cash hearts, hoping to pitch West's remaining diamond|pg||
nt|dburn: of course, if he had played a low heart to the queen instead of running the jack, as he probably should have done, he would have a quick entry to dummy now|pg||
nt|ftpe: yes|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|petergill: EW are topping the datums after 15 rounds http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/10Ostend/Results.htm|pg||

nt|MolvaM: next question. do you agree with 4nt?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: with 4-4=|pg||
nt|andreasw:  i would pass|pg||
nt|shevek: as I said, I would pass in all positions  lol|pg||
nt|andreasw:  :)|pg||
nt|tomi2:  @C lead would be fatal, but I can't imagine this|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so Jivko, just curiosity, you didn't consider 1N overcall by W?|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: Ice|pg||
nt|oleberg: South undeled his diamonds in case declarer had the @SJ|pg||
nt|oleberg: Then a low spade would have given declarer a guess|pg||
nt|psridhar: defense in 3nt will score at least the same tricks as they do in 3d|pg||
nt|psridhar: and many more if they find the spd lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The Danes also avoided the diamond slam on 10. The auction was short and sweet. 1@D  2@C  ;  3NT|pg||
nt|idc: Ok, we have set up an experiment - I'm told the OR is in 3NT so we will see how it goes :)|pg||
pc|s7|nt|jameslee 2: 8 more for Israel so score 11/2|pg||
nt|psridhar: that dia 3 by Fredin in the 3rd round of dia=sps for h ( 2 for cl and 4 for spd)- obediently Fallenius shifts to H for d2 wd|pg||
nt|tomi2:  west will take his time to think of the best play in trumps|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, double dummy he can make it, but the players don't have the hand records|pg||
nt|yusufb: @c ye K koysa yapabilirdi|pg||
nt|athene: this table does seem to be playing very quickly|pg||
pc|cA|nt|haans: now he must try spades|pg||
nt|eamongall: I am informed fucik and terraneo are only in mid 50s age |pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|ady: 7 imps for Iceland hand 9|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h7|nt|hawe45:  Claim|pg||
nt|dburn: but he would doubtless have used that to play for North to hold @sKx rather than @sK10x|pg||
nt|lesh: it depends on their methods and the decision of the player. 1NT could be 5@c and 4M, or as here he prefered DBL instead of overcalling 1nt as 15-17|pg||
nt|mdgraham: difference of style on board 7. KQxx xx xx AKQxx. Over 1@D - Lauria bid 2@C, +110. The Russian North doubled, which got them to 2@H, -50. Not that that proves anythng  |pg||
pc|hK|nt|shevek: flat hand, give it a go, sure pass|pg||
nt|h_karluk: oh that makes sense, thanks|pg||
nt|lesh: I dont know how E/W play 1nt overcall|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I'm glad they invented Bhunnahabhain|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 10 tricks. No damage done.|pg||
pc|c6|nt|rnmalik: sorry-11.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: There is no sane player who would insert the 10|pg||
nt|othered1: now west has to  hope that north also holds 4+@D to pitch both @H|pg||
nt|tomi2:  he will try for singleton king of clubs with south maybe ?;)|pg||
nt|brolucius: God is Italian in this room. But he will not be Italian in the other room, if they reach the good slam too.|pg||
nt|tomi2:  god was a German yesterday, that is quite fair :)|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: after X = N the would have been 11 tricks |pg||
nt|brolucius: After a spade lead, declarer would have a choice of lines after holding up the @SA for two rounds. Both of them work.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|bagman: Decision time, soon|pg||
pc|cT|nt|star6ija: but seems declarer will prevail anyway|pg||
nt|pitiful:  crikey @s 10|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, if they disallow legitimate goals, it's not easy to win football matches|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer should play a spade and see whant W plays|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Is that a single malt?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, from Islay.|pg||
nt|bagman: Thinking first when West plays the Q is waste of energy|pg||
nt|bagman: This is practically a pure flip|pg||
nt|andreasw:  not easy |pg||
nt|bagman: The a priori odds are balanced by the X=T/O|pg||
pc|c7|nt|h_karluk: no rush, rectrified the count|pg||

pc|d3|nt|paulhac:  Would have been right if West had QJ|pg||

nt|h_karluk: still @d winners|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|andersk: Paraguay - NZ 0-0|pg||

nt|odysseus69: in other key matches only Poland  heading for big win whch will move them closer but not to Italy the way this is going|pg||
mc|10|nt|brolucius: No excuses, we were hopeless and they were great.|pg||

nt|dburn: I suspect the play went quickly at the end - some of those cards were doubltess not played to the same trick|pg||
nt|shevek: I just had a glimpse at the poles playing in 6@d|pg||
nt|shevek: you too :)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  :)|pg||
nt|lesh: I wonder what 1NT is|pg||
nt|chick: 3 suit takeout?|pg||
nt|lesh: I suppose N/S will land at least at 5th level, but then E/W might bid 6@c and then ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: say didn't begin w art 1@c, 3 aces outside, so that's DD slam of EW players, what a homework, ty teacher!|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 11 cards @S for N-S|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: direct 4@S|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: by S|pg||
nt|koksoy: saol  biz  de  cok  hata  yapýyoruz...   konsantere  degiller|pg||
nt|pikonlu: bermudabowl'da konsantre olurlar|pg||
nt|yusufb: turnuvanýn 9 günü yorgunluk normal|pg||
nt|athene: 5@C is 500|pg||
nt|jkotor: i think the other table started later, due to live vugraph|pg||
mb|1N|nt|Gerben42: EW possibly in trouble now|pg||
nt|xenya: perhaps W was concerned about bad splits in the balck suits and 4-1 @Hs, but all was well|pg||
nt|8252: mais il vaut mieux soit qua ça marche, soit avoir des partenaires compréhensifs et doux|pg||
nt|odysseus69: wrong colours for 5C|pg||
mb|2C|nt|andersk: Est overcalled 1 @S in open room, and South 2 @S, quite strange bidding, anyway NOrway playing 5 NT in open room|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Looks like 4@H should make|pg||
nt|tomi2:  Wladow knows about partnes @C qualitiy, so he won't lead a club now ;)|pg||
nt|mamos: Gold keeps his 1@D openers up to strength :)|pg||
nt|funtay: adamlar 1 lovenin bile pesinde |pg||
nt|koksoy: 3nt  ya  ugrasacak...  oyun  ve  defans  zor...|pg||
nt|riccho: der italienische Sturm ist hier besser als in Südafrika: 46: 5 nach 13 Bds gegen Estland|pg||
nt|athene: south certainly doesn't have the distribution that five-level adventures are made of|pg||
nt|jkotor: 4@h is 420 :)|pg||
mb|2N|nt|ady: 5@C looks difficult with a trump trick and A@S off  and diamonds bottled up|pg||
nt|justin c: did East bid this?|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: unlikely undo ?|pg||
nt|eamongall: I don't think she meant to be rescued |pg||
nt|james_h: this might get interesting but I doubt it|pg||
nt|eamongall: ah yeah pass 1@S |pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 11: At the other table, South opened 1NT, West bid 2@C single suiter  and EW never found out what suit it was, so NS ended up in 4@H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://tinyurl.com/39bvxwu  for running scores. Only seniors playing this morning|pg||
nt|yuval10: 2@c persumably majors|pg||
mb|p|nt|andersk: 2-2|pg||
nt|andersk: no|pg||
nt|andersk: offside|pg||
nt|andersk: incredible match on TV too:)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 6@d may have communication problems.... between parters :)|pg||
nt|lesh: probably 1nt was 3 suits and that's why North decided to pass over 3@d|pg||
nt|lesh: and possible 5@c bid by West now if 1nt is what we suppose to mean|pg||
nt|petergill: something to be said for: calling a spade a spade, perhaps|pg||
nt|ralfwil: close to 6nt|pg||
nt|mdgraham: or even Two Spades|pg||
nt|petergill: yes|pg||
nt|petergill: Susan Stockdale knows that her @DK should be huge, being in partner's suit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: raise to 4NT?|pg||
nt|petergill: I think she will bid 4NT quantitative|pg||
nt|ralfwil: perhaps 4nt from W|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: nice fight by W = 5@C |pg||
nt|oleberg: 5@C is a nice save, -300|pg||
nt|corplaw: EW should bid and make 4H|pg||
nt|bagman: West not delighted if E can make a splinter|pg||
nt|ady: this is tough and go|pg||
nt|skaftij:  1NT = 14-16|pg||
nt|barnets: Italy are 5 victory points ahead of Poland - so this may be the decisive game in the championships|pg||
nt|odysseus69: the way things are going it looks like 1-2-3 will be as they were at the start but.....|pg||
mb|3N|nt|lesh: but still it will be very agressive |pg||
nt|funtay: sry|pg||
nt|suketbombi: @D lead is a killer impossible to find @H lead gives awat @S there is a chance for declerar|pg||
nt|skaftij:  East's bid showing majors will help|pg||
nt|suketbombi: away|pg||
nt|ady: will need to get 3 heart tricks and block the diamond suit if their is a switch by playing low|pg||
nt|ady: will need to play a low heart from ssouth |pg||
nt|riccho: 1@h = TRF |pg||
nt|yuval10: and 2NT is a competitive bid , or should be|pg||
mb|p|nt|eweber: but still, with 210 and 170 on my score card I wouldn't feel to good, it may not cost but surely won't bring in...|pg||
nt|andersk: even more exsiteing then bbo|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT hopless if they lead hearts   |pg||
nt|andreasw:  lol|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: dangerous reopenning here |pg||
nt|psridhar: thin 4s for EW , a lucky make -but imposs to get there unless pushed|pg||
nt|haans: but most of us would|pg||
nt|psridhar: South does have a good hand, cant fault him for reopening|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: what will North try to bid ?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think a similar example was in one of Ian Fleming's 007 JB books|pg||
nt|h_karluk: trappy sample|pg||
nt|lesh: I dont think North will pass|pg||
nt|lesh: South has showed 0-5 and 6+ spades but ...|pg||
nt|chick: N's hand is far too good|pg||
nt|chick: almost slam in hand|pg||
nt|lesh: 4@h is making|pg||
nt|chick: only problem is ... can he overcome his fear of 4-1 or 4-2 trump split in a red suit|pg||
nt|petergill: and then Fiona will probably pass, wanting one more diamond or one more highish card anywhere for 6NT|pg||
nt|ralfwil: With these two guys, you must be fast on the keyboard|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 4@S=620|pg||
nt|oleberg: If he gets diamonds right, which he will.|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 5@C=300 or 500|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Crikey, free lesson in Turkish|pg||
nt|mdgraham: is it really necessary to get to 2NT with the EW cards?|pg||
nt|koksoy: yorgunluktan  daha  ziyade   yüksek  beklentilerin  finallerin  ilk  macýnda kýrýlmasý  konsantrasyonu  dogal  olarak  biraz  azalttý  kanýsýndayým|pg||
nt|yusufb: 2@h 5+@s 4+@h 7-9 puan bunu oynayan baya cift var Türkiyede bende dahil|pg||
nt|koksoy: yoksa  buradaki  3  ciftimizde   15-20  gün  üstüste  oyunu  kaldýrabilecek  kapasite  de|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulhac:  Putting South to the test|pg||
nt|star6ija: 2@d game forcing|pg||
nt|tomi2:  he is mathematican and we often see him going for overtricks in games where he can go down, when he thinks odds are better than 95%|pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: Pani Agato! |pg||
nt|petergill: Fiona will like @D10, bulking up her long suit|pg||
nt|bagman: 2@S might be a start of a short suit trial|pg||
nt|idc: Oh, 3NT is on an earlier board|pg||
mb|p|nt|rigas_karo: maybe he thought declarer hand 6421|pg||
nt|andersk: same lead as open room, probably 11 and a push|pg||
nt|Gerben42: you never know yesterday I saw Greco Hampson making 3N on 11 vs 10|pg||
nt|peachy: somebody took a long time, I assume|pg||
nt|roswolf: looks very possible|pg||
nt|shevek: they had some intervention by west who showed the blacks, still....|pg||
nt|dburn: quite a lot may depend on the lead to 6NT - @c10 (or@c9 depending on methods) will not work well|pg||
nt|dburn: but this is dangerous|pg||
nt|petergill: Ralf, or you will be burned ... am I still allowed to commentate after that?  |pg||
nt|ralfwil: :)|pg||
nt|petergill: 6@C, in case West has 5 clubs|pg||
nt|dburn: although West probably ought to convert to 6NT...|pg||
nt|petergill: A conversion to 6NT would avoid the nasty 5-1 split|pg||
nt|petergill: With 4 clubs, East might have proceeded via "fourth suit forcing"|pg||
nt|yusufb: 5@d|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes pactical as he can alwats finnease the @HT|pg||
nt|tokay1975: alfredo showing his defensive values by dbli,ng if opp  bid more|pg||
nt|davidb: small H is ok|pg||
nt|Walddk2: For Israel, yes :)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: low h please -you mean|pg||
nt|yuval10: :)|pg||
pc|dT|nt|rnmalik: This board.|pg||
nt|peachy: and cant be but South|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes|pg||
nt|8252: il va falloir du bon timing ici|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It is when you open the East hand|pg||
nt|odysseus69: just what you dont want to hear when you open light in 3rd seat|pg||
nt|koksoy: cok  yukarý  gidiyorlar  3ny  gectiler...  5@D  oldukca  zor  gibi  gözüküyor|pg||
nt|riccho: 1SA vermutlich kein 3er @s|pg||
nt|j li: Khiuppenen wird sich anstrengen müssen|pg||
nt|j li: Ich sehe keine neun Stiche|pg||
nt|motu: @H ist ein gutes ausspiel|pg||
nt|udo: ich setzte auf die gegenspieler|pg||
nt|udo: vor allem nach dem Ausspie3l|pg||
pc|d7|nt|star6ija: 2N no 3@ss|pg||
nt|psridhar: note that S does not have values like unsupported king or queen sitting under the NT opener-he has a 'pure' hand|pg||
nt|chick: now a XX|pg||
nt|lesh: dangerous call|pg||
nt|chick: "pick another suit"|pg||
nt|lesh: he can even make 5@d|pg||
nt|lesh: 4@h and 5@d making but 3nt not |pg||
nt|chick: he can make 6H if he plays E for something like 4414 or 4405 ... losing 1 heart and no diamonds ... or am I missing something?|pg||
nt|james_h: I like Derek O'Gs raise|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: nice bid West|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: here is an example of a Vulnerable position safe for E-W|pg||
nt|brolucius: Not the sort of deal where you want to be playing against Italy...|pg||
nt|odysseus69: we are watching a Bocchi special- sadly I can offer no explanation|pg||
nt|bagman: 7@D here is a good contract|pg||
nt|Walddk2: How can you expect West to bid any less?|pg||
nt|bagman: or maybe not|pg||
nt|suketbombi: finnese|pg||
pc|d5|nt|paulhac:  E/wWhave done well to hold the loss to 5 Imps|pg||
nt|star6ija: well oriented|pg||
nt|haans: xy most popular checkback now|pg||
nt|star6ija: from East's hand @h lead may cause som damges|pg||
nt|star6ija: some|pg||
nt|star6ija: damages* :):)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: maybe 6nt is safest|pg||
nt|snetram:  wejÅcie 1 pik w niekorzystnych ambitne|pg||
nt|marlowepi: a mon avis, apres avoir pris la premiere levee au mort, c'est le 6 de trefle qu'on devrait jouer du mort et non le 10|pg||
nt|babs59: The chat about Scottish inventions had me googling additional Australian inventions.  I thought I needed to check facts |pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|collins64: just talk about why playing A@c on that 1st round|pg||
nt|boyklas: its possible|pg||
nt|ady: kib asking again for link to running scores please|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm not the expected lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/runningscores/asp/roundteamsconditstatclassicmod.asp?qtournid=817&qshowflag=1|pg||
nt|pitiful:  well this is not very interesting|pg||
nt|pitiful:  @c lead best|pg||
nt|lesh: opps 3nt also makes:) He has the entry for @d finess|pg||
nt|lesh: he can but it is impossible to bid|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i whispered he could pass to 3NX but seems was busy a lot and did not hear me|pg||
nt|chick: entry for @D finesse is a problem|pg||
nt|chick: and 6@C EW is makeable too, I think|pg||
nt|lesh: slams are makeable but it is diffucult to reach. |pg||
nt|chick: I dunno, I'd still keep trying to reach a red slam with N's hand|pg||
nt|lesh: from the bidding you know what 4@h are 4-1 at least and there is 4th @d in West|pg||
nt|chick: yes, that's what is scaring N into serious caution|pg||
nt|lesh: your partner is 0-5 points with 6+ spades|pg||
nt|lesh: you dont expect him have K@hxx and 109x in @d|pg||
nt|chick: and nothing wasted in @Ss :)|pg||
nt|aldek: ale konsekwentne|pg||
nt|barnets: yes even 7N makes|pg||
nt|odysseus69: when smoke clears I expect to see 7D|pg||
nt|yusufb: alýp @s pas atarsa 2-3 batar|pg||
nt|ozgull: pik empasý atýp fazla fazla batacak|pg||
nt|corplaw: now can make 5 on that lead|pg||
nt|suketbombi: well done|pg||
nt|tokay1975: thats  why he just didnot bid 3clubs|pg||
pc|c3|nt|star6ija: still some communication problems|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: problems are arriving for N-S |pg||
nt|psridhar: but 3C x is painful all the same|pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: Przepraszam...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, that's avoided the 5-1 trump break |pg||
nt|dburn: good decision - now all East has to do is make it|pg||
nt|petergill: Good decision by Susan, but can 6NT be made?|pg||
nt|Walddk7: It can|pg||
nt|dburn: North will probably be squeezed in the majors even if East does not pick the clubs|pg||
nt|dburn: but on this auction South is not all that likely to lead the suit|pg||
nt|ralfwil: N is squeezed in majors|pg||
nt|Walddk7: She can get four club tricks by force|pg||
nt|petergill: South has to lead - what? - something ... the hearts and spades lie over West's holdings, reducing squeeze possibilities|pg||
nt|ralfwil: A squeese in more fun than a double finess:)|pg||
nt|Walddk7: If she is inspired and trust that @CJ is a singleton she has four tricks in the suit. The rest will come from diamonds|pg||
nt|petergill: East's 3rd heart might be a vital threat in this hand which even Fiona, usually a fast but careful player, will take a long time to play, surely|pg||
nt|Walddk7: She has just enough entries for all that|pg||
nt|dburn: but if South chooses the queen of hearts (which is dangerous), East may well go astray|pg||
nt|petergill: Sandra Rimstedt can hardly lead a club after this bidding, or will she?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: @HQ is a bit of a Flash Harry sort of lead|pg||
nt|ralfwil: When E can see a 5-card @c and a 4-card @d the squeeze is easy|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: always remember to make actions depending on the vul position |pg||
nt|barnets: and 7@H|pg||
nt|odysseus69: however many will open on West|pg||
nt|davidb: this is also ok...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: As a wise man once said: "If you don't lead my suit, you had better be right!"|pg||
pc|c8|nt|collins64: no Mike show count on J@d lead 7 cards so not possible |pg||
nt|MolvaM: to protect the @cQ and against bad breaks,|pg||
nt|justin c: looks like 5 losers here|pg||
nt|petergill: A low club lead is safe into the expected 4-3 fit - either partner has a bare @C honour or she does not|pg||
nt|Walddk7: That will likely give the show away|pg||
nt|dburn: well, that's a safe club to lead - declarer probably won't take four club tricks now|pg||
nt|petergill: NS lead 3rd and 5th versus both NT and suit|pg||
nt|Walddk7: I think she will, they lead 5th|pg||
nt|Walddk7: That's what I meant by giving the show away|pg||
nt|dburn: yes, but they also lead third - it would be a little vexing to lose to @cJ109 or the like with North|pg||
nt|petergill: A club lead from a 3 or 4 card holding is unlikely (being risky, might pick up partner's queen) on the bidding|pg||
nt|dburn: well, declarer lost her way at the other table, so this is a big chance for Fiona Brown|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: here is ths most advantaje Vulnerable position for a pair Non Vul - Vul = we are clear advantaje never hesitate to fight 1 more |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: remember te only bad safe is when you are getting paid 1 don and you decided to defend |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 1 down |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: as you can see West has no key cards to fight againtx 4@S|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ady: got of to a bad lead    but still defence can recover  South will need to play a low heart when in with A@S   and north will have to read the position|pg||
nt|star6ija: decided by the defense|pg||
nt|andreasw:  Magnusson in control here and chose 6@h|pg||
nt|tomi2:  if he exited with a heart, Versace could have won the Jack and give partner a @D ruff to "get back" the 2 imps Kirmse was working for, but we don't know the cards exactly|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: so good 5@C|pg||
nt|corplaw: QS more sensible|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|roswolf: the lead was i think another sols flight of fancy|pg||
nt|shevek: good choice|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes had Mag bid a cue Harald would bid 6@d and Mag had to make a choise|pg||
nt|andreasw:  after 4nt from harald ofcourse|pg||
nt|MolvaM: spade lead?|pg||
nt|andreasw:  small @h lead but could cost the beating trick|pg||
nt|MolvaM: and then another spade (when in with @hA) could create problems|pg||
nt|andreasw:  i would lead the @c|pg||
nt|MolvaM: declarer must refrain from cashing diamonds|pg||
nt|lesh: opps|pg||
nt|chick: N did well not to double :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: okay, if the input is correct now i belived much to that old saying in BG. "The wolf has a thick neck, because he does his job on his own. "|pg||
nt|skaftij:  not difficult, would plan to finesse for the 10 next round|pg||
nt|ady: home now     good board for Iceland|pg||
nt|psridhar: pretty thin 1nt overcall , will be -500|pg||
pc|dK|nt|mcarroll: :)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  worst lead would be @D|pg||
nt|lesh: that's better|pg||
nt|h_karluk: agreed|pg||
nt|marlowepi: car E pourrait avec honneur seche, et tu ne vas pas en tout cas faire l'impasse au 2e tour d'atout contre le 8 en tous cas|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Lew Mathe I think it was|pg||
pc|d2|nt|eweber: y and board 10 was a good 16 opposite 8 here|pg||
nt|peachy: NS in the other room preempted themselves from 4H, it can happen|pg||
nt|bogier: 1100 kosztowa³oby chyba|pg||
nt|ralfwil: But there is also a double squeeze if S has only a 4-card @d, so correctplay is to win on dummy, and play on @d|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is East who should be able to count 13 tricks at the end.|pg||
nt|bagman: 7@H is easy to play, win the first trick and play @HA and heart to the T|pg||
nt|bagman: How would you play 7NT?|pg||
nt|bagman: I would go for double squeeze|pg||
nt|j li: Gute Nachricht: Pikschnitt klappt - schlechte Nachricht: piks stehen 4-2|pg||

nt|eweber: for NL|pg||

nt|psridhar: Fredin may get his 800 'back' !|pg||
nt|petergill: Lucky it's not me who is declarer, I would take forever... . and I mean "forever" ... to play this hand|pg||
nt|bagman: with spades as the pivot suit|pg||
nt|corplaw: risks spade ruff, but then can pitch losing diamond on 4th spade to still make 4|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer is ready to give 2 trumps and a spade.|pg||
nt|bagman: Playing trumps would be dangerous as he could lose two trumps a spade and a diamond|pg||
nt|bagman: This guarantees the contract|pg||
nt|bagman: on the assumption that S has the @SJ|pg||
nt|corplaw: even if S led from Qx of spades, contract still guaranteed|pg||
nt|bagman: yes. Goes down only if the Q came from Q9x :9|pg||
nt|corplaw: Q from Q9x would be the master stroke :)|pg||
nt|corplaw: and even then only if KJx of hearts is offside|pg||

nt|athene: hold up the ace of clubs and lead to the @DK|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But wasn't it -2 even in the endgame?|pg||

nt|haans: 1@S to show 2 3 spade no extra|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2@C was forcing to game, so I suppose a 2@S continuation covers all the spade raises.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@H over 2@H would be a @H raise and @D shortness|pg||
nt|othered1: and with no side shortness?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Let me ask giammi|pg||
nt|8252: sans les @s, on a du mal aussi|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: 2 off for sure|pg||
nt|barnets: anyone see a twelfth trick in hearts ?|pg||
nt|brolucius: East known to have long clubs, so Townsend is suspicious of the @S8 switch and declines the finesse.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: well done - cant be bad|pg||
nt|jkotor: yap, sorry, no entry|pg||
nt|athene: now he has time to get a club away on a heart|pg||

nt|ady: now 6 easy tricks    I am sure a 7th will come|pg||
nt|shevek: I'm told 2@s is 8-10 , 6@s|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: nice K@C helping card showing to secuence & giving parner a relax moment to tell him your lead made no damagge to defence|pg||
nt|marlowepi: meme cela revient a la chance:)|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 1- both opps are not strong |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 2- he has the @D controled |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 3-he has a lot of confidence |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 15/1 up|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 4- is not a part score not much dange on this x|pg||
nt|oleberg: Or at least the double shows, that diamonds is controlled, and south should be vary, leading from honours|pg||
nt|ralfwil: this lead makes that N can win the @d immediately and return another @s|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: tricks count |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: East |pg||
nt|oleberg: 3@D must have been invitational, so the double is "safe"|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 3@S+2@H+1@C=7 |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: he needs to develope the @D |pg||
nt|ralfwil: only 6 tricks from top, so let us see|pg||
nt|oleberg: the lead is a killer|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: sorry 6 yes |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: remember siesta time for Spanish people |pg||
nt|oleberg: This will always take at least 7 tricks, 6 obvious ones, and seventh cannot help but being devellopped|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: Siesta= good life in spain / relax moment and here we are fighting in this match :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|pitiful:  safe play by declarer|pg||
nt|mamos: making safe|pg||
nt|pitiful:  leaving trump in dummy to ruff @s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2NT= asking for min/max and distribution. Denies @S raise, may have @H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So they go through 2NT with a balanced heart raise|pg||
nt|riccho: eigentlich... |pg||
nt|motu: wenn man da kontriert wird weiss man nicht ob man drin bleiben soll oder lieber 3@C reizen sollte|pg||
nt|tokay1975: yes with dia guess |pg||
nt|odysseus69: ok if he played hearts and guessed diamonds but is that right play- d finesse looks simpler|pg||
nt|dburn: once again, Israel prepared to chance a slam missing the queen of trumps, but...|pg||
nt|odysseus69: low trump lead|pg||
nt|brolucius: Some recommend leading @CA from the East hand.|pg||
nt|dburn: ...this time the defence can't get a ruff - the only hope for Italy is that declarer, playing for a swing, will go against the percentages in clubs|pg||
pc|c3|nt|boyklas: 5C at boar 12|pg||
nt|rnmalik: would require some play.|pg||
nt|andersk: this contract is not makeable|pg||

nt|Walddk2: hrmpff|pg||
nt|dburn: as well he might, now|pg||
nt|brolucius: But then you look sick when partner has the singleton @CJ.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: How on earth did he find that lead?|pg||
nt|dburn: well, it could not cost and might gain|pg||
nt|davidb: victor found as well |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Some specs tell me that it was pretty obvious|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I can't understand why they are not playing|pg||
nt|odysseus69: but should get it right- we think|pg||
pc|c2|nt|haans: do not understand low spade|pg||
nt|Walddk7: At TGR they would probably play this in 3NT in order collect 150 honours|pg||
nt|petergill: This gives declarer an entry to dummy for the doomed trump finesse|pg||
nt|koksoy: 4@H  e  gerek  yoktu..  ancak  3@C  yaptýrýp  110  verecegimize  3@H +1 170  alsaydýk...|pg||
nt|ozgull: ama yinede bir partskor kaybý gibi|pg||
nt|ady: will need to play east for doubleton K@H|pg||
nt|j li: Aber 2@S verpflichtet direkt zur 3er Stufe|pg||
pc|c6|nt|boyklas: boar|pg||
nt|shevek: I think it also suggests shortage in @h|pg||
nt|chick: can make 6, but I predict only 5 ... will set up @Ds, they will knock out the other @S stopper, and he won't dare take the @H finesse|pg||
nt|petergill: Declarer has to misguess a lot in order to fail|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Welcome to Jaap Frijling|pg||
nt|jkotor: board 7, 3@s same as here, fighting between -1 and -2|pg||
nt|dburn: it is not an unknown tactic|pg||
nt|yuval10: and he made it|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|collins64: Mike 14 HCP opening is not going to run good here|pg||
nt|eweber: wow, another 11 for NL|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Spade lead looked normal|pg||
nt|athene: lauria-versace got some way towards 4@H - just not all the way|pg||
nt|pitiful:  you mentioned flash boys|pg||
nt|lesh: with doubleton Q@d and Q@c and @H finess working he can even make 12 tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That is an excellent switch, it will set up a club trick in time|pg||
nt|brolucius: You are forgetting the 'when in doubt' rule, Roland.|pg||
pc|c4|nt|peachy: 3Nt was better since hearts 4-4, but one never knows|pg||
nt|chick: hmm, now he may have to take the @H finesse|pg||
nt|lesh: however,what is more important is to make your contract|pg||
nt|jkotor: lol, dosta³em na priv pytanie, |pg||
nt|cumino: if they don't lead @D|pg||
nt|suketbombi: cud aways guess the @HS to make the 8th on the @S switch asthe cards are but much easier now|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|rnmalik: cannot rule out an error by the defense.|pg||
nt|eweber: 26:4 now|pg||
nt|MolvaM: the iceland pairs doing extremely well in the event|pg||
nt|jaapfr: hoi Roland et all:)|pg||
pc|cK|nt|MolvaM: one pair ranked 1st in butler with 1,66 imp/board|pg||
nt|MolvaM: other 2 pairs also high with 0,84 and 0,3 plus|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 1,66 imp average over 100 boards is phenomenal|pg||
nt|xenya: well at least it served as a lead director|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 9@D a very strong card in N|pg||
nt|bagman: Surprise @CA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So maybe we will see 500 on 12 after all|pg||
nt|idc: Note that Finland are fighting back v Poland, so Italian lead back up to 6 VPs|pg||
nt|psridhar: the play record in this room shows -2 only though the score entered is d1|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The Italians also caught in 1NTX on 12. Now they are running|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and at this point they are doubled in 2@C. Auction not over|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@DX it is|pg||
mc|12|nt|Gerben42: thanks to the 3@S opener|pg||
nt|bagman: The defense can get 800 if they make no mistake. Often a trick is dropped|pg||
nt|bagman: and declarer escapes with -500|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Oh well, not when West did not win the first diamond|pg||

nt|barnets: swing to Italy I predict|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Anyway, pretty play as one would expect from Lauria|pg||
nt|skaftij:  or promoting @s 10|pg||
nt|athene: on the basis that if the @DQ is onside, the other declarer will make anyway|pg||
nt|athene: playing for @DA right you are trying to turn the non-club lead into a game swing|pg||
nt|dburn: at any rate, it seemed to be in North's box of tricks as well as East's|pg||
nt|yuval10: actions doesn't stop|pg||
nt|brolucius: Fitting that we should get such boards in the very last round of a great tournament.|pg||
nt|davidb: the tempo of the lead  did help . bravo ophir |pg||
mb|1D|nt|Gerben42: but 10-13 look solid Dutch results|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 4@S|pg||
nt|vasmar: 4@H is a playable contract for N-S|pg||
nt|athene: 2@C is hearts, weak or strong, or strong balanced|pg||
nt|xenya:  i'm told that 2@D was not a multi but a 5M-4m 2-suiter|pg||
nt|xenya: 2@D=18-19|pg||
nt|xenya: so another dull hand|pg||
nt|ftpe: normal 4 he here|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: WE HAVE A TECHNICAL PROBLEM|pg||
nt|xenya: i'm a bit surprised by the pause|pg||
nt|xenya: ah|pg||
nt|xenya: hope you fix it soon|pg||
nt|xenya: anyway, the Estonian W in the OR did well to get hearts right. making an overtrick and possibly gaining an imp for his side|pg||

nt|udo: 2@S stört mehr, zeigt mehr, verrät aber auch mehr,   kann alles richtig sein,, ich bevorzuge aber 2@S,,|pg||
nt|athene: or maybe he is going the other way, thinking that if the other declarer is in 3nt, he will be forced to lead to @DK because of west having cashing clubs|pg||
nt|athene: so he wants to avoid a game swing out|pg||
nt|jkotor: lol, but what if there is no @c lead this hand?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And it has been confirmed that it actually *was* 500 on board 12 in this room|pg||
mb|p|nt|shevek: 4@s might be a reasonable spot here|pg||
mb|1S|nt|andersk: pls correct to minus 3|pg||
nt|eweber: if the medals were given for speed this table would probably qualify :)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: they will have to wait for their partners quite some time throughout the tournament|pg||
nt|Gerben42: Bauke Muller is not known to be fast|pg||
nt|eweber: 1@d here showed 11-16 with 4+ @d, unbalanced|pg||
nt|Gerben42: showing 4+@D paid off here|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 5@S still cheap for 300|pg||
nt|eweber: and the limit is useful as well|pg||
nt|eweber: in such auctions|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 6@D must be defended carefully, but I think after @S2 lead Drijver will get it|pg||
nt|eweber: with 7 hcp in @s 5@s is an option|pg||
nt|vasmar: double now|pg||
nt|ady: played a diamond to the 9 early on to make 4@S on board 9|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D game try in hearts perhaps but NS should wander into 4@S without too much difficulty |pg||
nt|athene: 3@S pass 4@S now|pg||
nt|pitiful:  5@c a nice spot here|pg||
nt|justin c: might try 6@H here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They gave him a chance to shine, and he grabbed it|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 4H for 650 where 1Dx was 800 here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@D=18-20 balanced|pg||
nt|babs59: Board 12 was sensibly passed out|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Operator, could you please correct that?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Here is the code ...|pg||
nt|idc: I just reviewed the play and was about to say the same|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1NNX-2|pg||
nt|psridhar: 2D x is not less than 500 if defense leads trumps as they shd|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Click on MOVIE, put your mouse to board 12 and overwrite 1NNX-2|pg||
nt|psridhar: 2 tricks each in S/H/D for decl at best|pg||
nt|idc: meanwhile, this is a fun hand in prospect too|pg||
nt|psridhar: grand|pg||
mb|p|nt|shevek: Unfortunately losing 2@h - 1@d - 1@c|pg||
nt|lesh: 4@h and 4@s are making,just need to be reached|pg||
nt|petergill: OK, David is right, if @SK was from KJ doubleton the play for the overtrick risks the contract|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: the normal action practicly is ths K@C from KQ ending the defence  I enjoyed that detail|pg||
nt|odysseus69: that means there snt 1 - I never try for unbid slams- not enough grey cells|pg||
nt|udo: weches Vollspiel ist das chancenreichste auf OW ?|pg||
mb|2D|nt|roswolf: could be passed out?|pg||
nt|roswolf: no east protects|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes is down|pg||
nt|MolvaM: well dont be sure|pg||
nt|xenya: aha!|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: lets go for the next board |pg||
nt|ryskiel_: nie 2 BA?|pg||
nt|jkotor: undo pls|pg||
nt|oleberg: 1NT = GF-relay|pg||
nt|udo: 3SA?|pg||
nt|riccho: 1@s im X|pg||
nt|idc: Grand slams not good but making on the actual layout|pg||
nt|brolucius: I don't want to propagate it, since it is such an absurd rule.|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzng: the CR send me -2 will check|pg||
nt|andersk: ok|pg||
nt|brolucius: E/W play the weak 1NT, as we saw a deal or two ago, so they open 1@D here.|pg||
nt|jkotor: 1nt i think|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - ou 500 Ã¡ 5 @D X|pg||
nt|petergill: maybe|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@H 11-16, usually at least 5|pg||
nt|dburn: board 10 looking rather more significant now, perhaps|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Another swing for Israel. 3NT in the other room|pg||
mb|3H|nt|Gerben42: at least the auction heated up some :)|pg||
nt|eweber: no double?|pg||
nt|tomi2:  1@S might have longer clubs than spades, I hope he alerted this :)|pg||
nt|andersk: stoppage time now|pg||
nt|haans: Cullin have it|pg||
nt|ady: very thin balance|pg||
nt|athene: now we have to find the club lead|pg||
nt|pitiful:  Roland is probably glued to the cricket at this moment|pg||
nt|MolvaM: elimination possibilities|pg||
nt|haans: 5@D looked like beginner bridge|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: all nicely placed & good distribution , makes 6@H |pg||

nt|odysseus69: mexican 2D - balanced 18/19 - popular with Italy |pg||
nt|yusufb: pas|pg||
nt|yuval10: 3NT ns previous board|pg||
nt|odysseus69: now if we go back to board 2 and bid that slam it would become interesting|pg||
mb|p|nt|collins64: 5@c just made for Greece|pg||
nt|santyclz: Protecting the @hAQ.  Didn't see that coming.|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt not a bad shot - even when a minor-suit lead is right for the defence it's going to be hard for east to find it|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: West trying to disturb bidding |pg||
nt|h_karluk: x and cue|pg||
nt|sastro: fühle mich geehrt Udo ( hab diese Reizung mal vor 45 Jahren eingeführt )|pg||
nt|psridhar: Berg is no daisy-picker|pg||
nt|dburn: since if 6@h had made, Israel would now be leading the tournament|pg||
mb|4S|nt|vasmar: small diamond lead :)|pg||
nt|pitiful:  2@s will play ok|pg||
nt|MolvaM: academic now|pg||
nt|xenya: back to life|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 4@D?|pg||
nt|oleberg: 4@D = This distribution (And 2@h also showed minimum)|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 5/4/4/0 ?showing shape with void @C |pg||
nt|oleberg: Yes|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Do you all pass as S after 1@s opening? not for me. 3@c|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: nice |pg||
nt|oleberg: after 2@S 2NT would have shown a balanced hand|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: lets see if West  can stop in game |pg||
nt|yusufb: 3@s|pg||
mb|p|nt|ziff:  No insider jokes please :)|pg||
nt|tomi2:  maybe there will be an appeal and in september they will decide...|pg||
nt|haans: 5@D a make 2|pg||
nt|andersk: OMG ITALY MISSED FROM 5 meters 5 min over stopppage time|pg||
nt|haans: 6@D a make if @H lead|pg||
nt|yuval10: small @s would've been great|pg||
nt|yuval10: then they force declarer|pg||
nt|haans: more likely that E have the Q rather than A = weaker hand|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: they must be aware they having a poor set so might go for 6@h|pg||
nt|oleberg: 3@C and higher shows the intire distribution|pg||
nt|udo: 2@H ist jetzt sicher keine reversreizung,sondern eher ein schwächeres verteilungsblatt|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzng: NO DOUBLE APPARENTLY|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: sorry for upcqse|pg||
nt|Gerben42: Rudakov didnt know what 5@D showed in defense and Khven didn't count on @DA I guess|pg||
nt|paulhac:  An OK slam|pg||
nt|lmeili: how to show longer @d than @s?|pg||
nt|mamos: was 2@h single or two suited ?  the latter I think|pg||
nt|shevek: phantom got in the way|pg||
nt|MolvaM: tahts the problems with phantoms|pg||
nt|shevek: won't cost much though|pg||
nt|MolvaM: they should stick to hanging out in the operas|pg||
nt|babs59: we've also seen one from Russia on board 2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2NT=transfer to 3@C, either sign-off, balanced slam try or a slam try with 6+@H |pg||
nt|odysseus69: or maybe because he had a feeling for the diamond position |pg||
nt|jkotor: i do not respond on messages "why B-¯ does not play this match?", plz dont priv me|pg||
nt|Walddk2: LOL|pg||
mb|p|nt|shevek: will get away with -50|pg||
nt|shevek: instead of +50|pg||
nt|mdgraham: could also be a sign-off in hearts|pg||
nt|athene: @DK lead at some point takes out the entry to the clubs, so he can't discard his diamond loser|pg||
nt|odysseus69: indecently fortunate lie of cards for 4H but is it enough|pg||
nt|psridhar: he did reach his top spot |pg||
nt|idc: Science is for people in white coats; Berg has no time for such nonsense :)|pg||
nt|psridhar: rather swiftly|pg||
pc|c7|nt|vugraphzng: seems to be clqi;end for -2, correction will come later if needed|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Diamonds 3-3 or doubleton J|pg||
nt|andersk: I have to go for a few|pg||
nt|tomi2:  he upgraded his hand to 18 with those aces and kings|pg||
nt|snetram:  teraz operator|pg||
nt|babs59: Will they be able to stop short of slam now?|pg||
nt|suketbombi: a 50% slam here (slightly less) for e-w a 4@C bid showing good clubs and a max wud hav e helped|pg||
nt|udo: mit stärkeren Blätern zuerst Kontra|pg||
nt|riccho: jetzt sind es 9 einfache stiche|pg||
nt|j li: Der Überraschungsangriff - Kirmse nimmt wenig überrascht neun Stiche mit|pg||
nt|riccho: server hakt in Belgien? Selbst Andreas dürfte hier nicht viel zu denken haben|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe not the top spot. 7@C is probably the best grand slam|pg||
pc|c2|nt|vasmar: now small diamond works also|pg||
nt|vasmar: if S misguesses|pg||
nt|ady: low diamond lead will beat this|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: puppet + 3@s showing hearts|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: there he is nice 4@S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: TGry to bid that on 4-2 :)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|eweber: non vul doubling for -1 is a bad bargain when the contract may be made, none of them knows about the opther one's quick tricks|pg||
nt|ady: thlow spade lead also good enough|pg||
nt|mamos: just Hearts I'm told|pg||
nt|andreasw:  they were not in 4@s|pg||
nt|shevek: phantoms , yes :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Ivan was good enough to find it, grats|pg||
nt|bogier: 2BA wychodzi - 3@D raczej nie|pg||
nt|jkotor: 2ba wygl¹da na -1, ale oppsy otworzyli kara od strony W i =|pg||
nt|antoniz: zamieni³ stryjek......|pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: 2BA wysz³o|pg||
nt|snetram:  zniechÄcili siÄ do otwarcia 2NT i grajÄ normalnÄ czÄÅciÃ³wkÄ|pg||
nt|oleberg: Well, 12 tricks are easy, on the friendly lay.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 6@s as @d are AJ|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: hand 13 playing 3NT but other side & not X |pg||
nt|odysseus69: it seems that nobody knows what to expecxt from preempts - its because players are varying them so much|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't think so, and slam is not that bad|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's basically on a finesse|pg||
nt|babs59: 6@C is the best slam|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6@C can make when diamonds are 3-3 or queen doubleton|pg||
nt|corplaw: looks like 2D should make exactly|pg||
nt|athene: so even though west has no entry, the defence should take a diamond, a club and two spades|pg||
nt|psridhar: after the dia lead Berg will take his extra 80 points|pg||
nt|idc: Hmmm, well spotted Roland, I like how sick your mind is :)|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|peachy: nicely judged|pg||
nt|peachy: as it is, 12 tricks|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Unless he takes a diamond finesse|pg||
nt|peachy: if they duck club, it will be testy|pg||
nt|brolucius: If yo use 12-14 and 15-17 as your ranges for 1NT and the 1NT rebid, a jump rebid of 2NT shows 18-19. They must do something different since West has only 17 here.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Hardly worth an upgrade, with those intermediates, it would seem.|pg||
nt|tomi2:  @S2 gives you the count of the spades, they should behave 4-4|pg||
nt|othered1: Giving an extra Work point or two when  you have only aces and kings is reasaonable, perhaps mandatory|pg||
nt|bagman: NS had 5@C or 5@D, going 1 or 2 down in 4@S is no disaster here|pg||
pc|s6|nt|ady: heart contract for 9 tricks best  |pg||
nt|haans: he had been thinking|pg||
nt|mcarroll: They dont listen to you Hans :)|pg||
nt|haans: see that|pg||
nt|haans: why not clubs to 9|pg||
nt|star6ija: 3rd hand plays high?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 6 clubs needs help from defence - preferably diamond lead- 6NT no chance |pg||
nt|athene: or failing that east could just switch to a small club here|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|rigas_karo: well, at least this is NV :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: might be a few twists and turns though|pg||
nt|star6ija: no entries for dummy|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 4@H+2 =480 |pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer cannot get the diamonds wrong so he has 6 tricks there and gets at least one spade and either a @H or a @C|pg||
nt|bagman: Here most of the guesses work|pg||
pc|s7|nt|andersk: ty|pg||
nt|Gerben42: @H ruff is -2 |pg||
nt|yuval10: she indeed misguessed|pg||
nt|athene: small club after the @DA gives declarer a nasty moment but the odds must be to rise king|pg||
nt|athene: west would indeed lead low from @CQJxx, knowing the suit has to run, but it's more likely he simply has the ace|pg||
nt|aldek: non-vulnerable could be very weak|pg||
nt|mamos: not a great bid then imho   it made any exploration of the hands here impossible|pg||
nt|shevek: Thomas would've bid 4@s if it came around|pg||
nt|andreasw:  and then u could bid 5@c with the risk of being dbl but still u never now|pg||
nt|shevek: true, they bid it to make|pg||
nt|lechcold: 2BA nieestetyczne z uwagi na dziurê w treflach|pg||
nt|jkotor: sorry, spojrza³em, ¿e oba króle nie stoj¹...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: en toute probabilite, 300 a 5Kx je crois|pg||
nt|justin c: west might have preferred 4@C to 4@h |pg||
nt|petergill: NS play Two Way Checkback after 1@H - 1@S - 1NT|pg||
nt|petergill: so 2@C would have been artificial|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: instead E is playing West|pg||
nt|babs59: you can discard the 3rd @D on the @H, when @DQ doesn't drop - then @S to dummy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why help, Victor?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You pitch a diamond on a heart|pg||
nt|odysseus69: take me through play please|pg||
nt|bagman: The only losing case is to play W for AJ|pg||
nt|jkotor: and there is no way to play from Hand|pg||
nt|tokay1975: defense is not easy|pg||
nt|jkotor: small @c also beats it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Wasn't me, some other Dane in the audience|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|shevek: flat board|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Give the hand to K&R and ask what it's worth|pg||
nt|aldek: ktora nie idzie|pg||
nt|snetram:  a 3 karo nie wyjdzie|pg||
nt|barnets: it is though a very intersting question why one of the best 4 pairs in the word are stting on the sidelines as the championship is dcided|pg||
nt|athene: or even a third spade is ok, because after leading to the @CK, declarer has no way back to hand to lead another one up|pg||
nt|barnets: in the world|pg||
pc|hA|nt|haans: @H to Q and they forget to take two @D|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 3@D we can take it as a trial bid |pg||
nt|yusufb: 8@s altýn|pg||
nt|bagman: or for J only if a low comes now|pg||
pc|h3|nt|haans: they did forget|pg||
nt|antoniz: tak jest -1|pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: 2@D,2@S,2@C|pg||
nt|justin c: but unclear whether East can cooperate over that|pg||
pc|h8|nt|peachy: good lead, gives nothing away|pg||
nt|lesh: thanks everyone, I have to go|pg||
nt|babs59: however, 6@C (by South) on a @S lead is trickier|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It is true that a spade lead kills the entry|pg||
nt|babs59: I missed the ruffing the 13th @D good, before going back to the @S - so 5 clubs, 3 hearts, 3 diamonds, 1 spade|pg||
nt|odysseus69: I see how but is that likely line- and of couse spade lead finishes it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, but there is an alternative, and losing, line|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe even a better one|pg||
nt|babs59: Just one?  I see the @D finesse, or trying for short @SA, or a squeeze|pg||
nt|Walddk2: diamond finesse in combination with @SA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: doubleton|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|pitiful:  well if that is your style and it works well for you you tend to stick to it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Kaplan & Rubens Hand Evaluator|pg||
nt|tomi2:  we will need some undo here|pg||
pc|h5|nt|koksoy: herhalde  batmaz...  karolar  partaj  (3-3)|pg||
pc|h4|nt|dburn: looks natural to play a spade now, but I don't think it will work|pg||
nt|odysseus69: and as my friend Tony Waterlow pointed out if he guesses to play spade Q on Jack he is stil ok - all very inspired|pg||
pc|s8|nt|ady: no way to make unless north discards 2 clubs when hearts are run|pg||
nt|chick: thanks Jivko@H@H|pg||
nt|aldek: 2BA nie mozna przegrac|pg||
nt|oleberg: The underlead looked costly, but gained a trick|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You need @SK as an entry if you go for diamonds (no finesse)|pg||
nt|bagman: E sees that most of the suits are frozen so attacks the trumps|pg||
nt|odysseus69: dont think the 3S bid was right- didnt suggest heart void o me|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They spot impossible contracts in a split second|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|vasmar: plenty of tricks now for N-S nut not enough ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 18.3 on the K&R so an upgrade was fine|pg||
pc|d3|nt|rigas_karo: @d now for -3|pg||
nt|yuval10: big board for Germany|pg||
nt|ady: south likely to discard 2 diamonds and a club|pg||
nt|roswolf: well i think this can make by force but timing needs to be exacrt|pg||
pc|d2|nt|brolucius: Declarer went against Restricted Choice in the heart suit.|pg||
nt|jkotor: Janusz jedn¹ lewê zdejmij|pg||
pc|s2|nt|paulhac:  He may be able to work out the distribution in which case he may well go off|pg||
nt|peachy: cashing spades to get information on shapes and discards, not sure if it will help him|pg||
nt|santyclz: I'm sure I could convince myself to go wrong there.|pg||
nt|athene: now Mari gets squeezed in the minors|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: sweden made another 5 Imp,s move on board 13|pg||

nt|Walddk2: I have, but that's for the TV|pg||

nt|bagman: The redoubled 2@C reminds me of a deal from 1993 Menton against two Polish players|pg||
nt|suketbombi: showing @Cs and @SS i guess|pg||
nt|ady: 11 tricks in spades for n/s|pg||
nt|suketbombi: 3@C trf to @Ds i think|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 7 IMPs to Italy on 12. Only 1 down in 2@DX|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Even on a trump lead|pg||
nt|psridhar: Schaltz was a little sloppy with the H spots in other room in that 2d X allowing italy 7 crucial imps|pg||
nt|idc: Looks like Peter Schaltz went wrong - holding @h873 he led 3 into declarer's @h96|pg||
nt|idc: all assuming the play record is right|pg||
nt|psridhar: this is a take out X of 1S, but may get passed |pg||
nt|psridhar: unless s removes to 2d|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, sometimes we, unfairly, blame the players for something they have not done at the table|pg||

nt|ady: 5@D    500  against 650   |pg||
nt|Walddk2: That is very frustrating for the players|pg||
nt|psridhar: but we hv no choice but to go by the play records ?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No, but one has to be a little careful|pg||
mb|2H|nt|Gerben42: 4@H and still no suits have been shown|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like another routine game for EW?|pg||
nt|tomi2:  other table will make this becasue NS lead 2/4/6 and a 6 card suit not bid is unlikely|pg||
nt|petergill: (11) 12-14|pg||
nt|barnets: on the slam it is suggested if dec can come down to @DAK in dummy and !AQ and 3 @Ds in hand and a trump|pg||

nt|pitiful:  this is going to be ugly but could be at most tables|pg||
nt|dburn: what is Gold doing?|pg||
nt|aldek: this will be bloody|pg||
nt|dburn: bidding 4@h in case partner didn't hear him bid 3@h?|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe this is a misprint - it's hard to believe that East really bid like this; perhaps 4@h was really 4@d|pg||
nt|pitiful:  initially David was not enjoying the auction, now it is Tom's turn to join in|pg||
nt|othered1: If you're going to take a line like west's, why not just play @S back at NS right away?|pg||

nt|bagman: We got to 2@C XX via Stayman and I was the declarer. My screenmate showed me his hand expecting my partner to be playing it|pg||
nt|corplaw: only 8 tricks on a heart lead, but will N lead his suit|pg||

nt|jkotor: 3nt from E finishes it|pg||
nt|athene: i mean in the big book of disciplined bidding, there is a picture of that hand under the heading "2@H" isn't there?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Our job is to comment on bidding and play, not how the selectors choose their team|pg||
nt|idc: I remember once writing a column which was (mildly) critical of a player, and it turned out hand records had swapped E & W|pg||
mb|p|nt|collins64: it looks like it was a quick pass from North|pg||
nt|ady: anyone know what 1@H is    not alert?|pg||
nt|ftpe: yes|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@S max with 5 spades|pg||
nt|barnets: south is caught in a trump sueeze|pg||
nt|odysseus69: i did suggest d10|pg||
nt|ady: surprising to go to 5@S by north     should pass round for south to decide|pg||
nt|suketbombi: yes and @S need to be 2/2 for 5@s wise to settle for 500 but..|pg||
nt|jkotor: from good 15 he could have jump 3@d|pg||
nt|Walddk2: On one occasion Fredin was blamed. The trouble was that he was not West in that match, but East. So all partner's faults were blamed on Fredin. He was not a happy camper I can tell ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: you|pg||
nt|idc: not BBO I should add, but official EBL hand records|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: NT will be a poor strain this time, one can only hope they dont bid 3|pg||
nt|lmeili: good gor Germany, no double|pg||
nt|pitiful:  interesting lead for south|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: chance here if E/W can produce some red cards|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: actually plays quite well 3@d be close|pg||
nt|petergill: Even if you play Simple Stayman, responding 3@H or 3@S with a max with a 5 card suit to simple Stayman is a pretty good idea IMO, rarely costs|pg||
nt|petergill: No reason to get spades wrong, as far as I can see|pg||
nt|ozgull: batýnýn 5 pik demesini bekliyoruz :)|pg||
nt|tokay1975: i thk  alfredo passed  automatically this  hand|pg||

nt|ziff:  No double, no trouble|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Maths + psychology. Maybe he has a point|pg||
nt|yusufb: 3@s deyince salvo @d dayalý elini anlattý þimdiki 4nt gereksiz bence|pg||
nt|corplaw: another hand where lead from longest suit works best|pg||
nt|corplaw: an original low club lead though could set contract 2 tricks|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer has enough entries to take care of JTxx in South so West is quite happy now|pg||
nt|barnets: many mesages coming in from the spectators roland i have about 20|pg||
nt|athene: and now west might leap into action with leaping michaels|pg||
pc|d2|nt|eweber: and probably no chance to find the 2nd fit|pg||
nt|motu: hard to dbl for N|pg||
nt|MolvaM: now a non heart lead could bring overtrivk|pg||
nt|andreasw:  will bring a overtrcik but a @h lead look's fair|pg||

nt|jkotor: no way for 2@h opening|pg||
nt|barnets: and trying to deal with them|pg||
nt|tokay1975: because  the  set had  lots of bad distrubution hands|pg||
nt|athene: ah right of course in polish methods it's a 2@D opener |pg||
nt|jkotor: they play 2@d multi :)|pg||
nt|tokay1975: and he is believing this|pg||
nt|athene: ok, so 2@D 4@D leaping michaels the same|pg||
nt|tokay1975: he follows the set|pg||
nt|tokay1975: vul against nvul  he just followed the set|pg||
nt|tokay1975: he works  on this for years  i am sure|pg||
nt|me argent: this will be tough to beat|pg||
nt|athene: you mean "bad breaks on previous boards, so bad breaks on this one?" that's sort of mad isn't it?|pg||
nt|athene: that's like "head, head, head, next one MUST be tails"|pg||
nt|tokay1975: this is very strange for all  of us not to open 2h|pg||
nt|tokay1975: yes he works  on this|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|yuval10: over @s lead, S needs to signal what she has|pg||

nt|dburn: well, he has six tricks|pg||

nt|ryskiel_: a seniorsi 48-30 z Walij¹|pg||
nt|oleberg: And a squeeze of East is lurking, but much to double-dummy to find|pg||
nt|tokay1975: but thats why he is versace|pg||
nt|brolucius: Must hope for a singleton spade with West now.|pg||
nt|dburn: meanwhile, how would East-West do in a sacrifice of some kind?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: how many imps needed for 25|pg||
nt|dburn: 48|pg||
pc|d5|nt|peachy: Not sure what subesequent bidding showed. |pg||
nt|hawe45:  South throws trick away|pg||
nt|athene: NS lead attitude against notrumps - definitely favoured amongst the top italian players|pg||
nt|dburn: so I guess that's four down|pg||
nt|pitiful:  i was thinking 3|pg||

nt|yuval10: will help P not to play @c here|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 1 imp for wales now|pg||
nt|oleberg: the defence to 6@H should be possible to find|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: Iceland on the lead 16/15 |pg||
nt|ralfwil: too high is always selfdefending:)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: however not on scoreboard yet|pg||
nt|idc: That must be what hell is like: for eternity you have to watch partner butcher hands|pg||
nt|idc: then you get blamed for the mistakes   *shudder*|pg||
pc|d7|nt|vasmar: she must continue spades now|pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: Nie - Operator sie grobn¹³. Rozgrywaka jeszcze trwqa|pg||
nt|barnets: so there are 4 cards left in each hand|pg||
nt|odysseus69: yes a good result|pg||
nt|tokay1975: hard to understand but  he is working on this  |pg||
nt|psridhar: without the X of 1N that raise to 3D is normal enuf; but with the X, Berg might hv considered passing 2d |pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|dburn: yes, but you're not defending|pg||
nt|pitiful:  i know 4 looks likely but sometimes 1 gets away |pg||
nt|dburn: oh, sure - no one ever believes how bad the contract actually is|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: time for a good think by east |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: A@S or not ?|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: A@S makes = 12 tricks asOle told us |pg||
nt|oleberg: No 11|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If my partner lead @s2 he has an honour..... |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: so defence needs to put J@S|pg||
nt|oleberg: There is always a heart-loser|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: true there is a 9@H problem there good point by specs|pg||
nt|oleberg: But the @SJ will keep declarer to 10 tricks|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|yusufb: þimdi @s gelirse ne atýcak:)|pg||
nt|koksoy: ufak  kör  gelme  :)|pg||
nt|bagman: Now north is hoping that West has Qx of clubs|pg||
nt|corplaw: another possible large swing to bulgaria|pg||
nt|bagman: He knows he cannot beat the contract any more and hopes that it was makeable with any lead|pg||
nt|riccho: Sieht nach billig 2 down aus. Wenn die defense noch was probiert ist es vielleicht auch nur 1 down...|pg||
nt|psridhar: of course S might hv had a distributional hand making 5d attractive|pg||
pc|s7|nt|snetram:  tu moÅ¼e byc bez jednej|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: I think S meant 2NT as pick a minor over 3@C would decide whether to pass or not|pg||
pc|s5|nt|Gerben42: 13 tops now |pg||
nt|petergill: With 9 trumps, you play for the drop, and with 8 trumps you finesse the queen, unless the bidding and/or play suggests otherwise |pg||
nt|oleberg: It is always 11 (thx kibz) |pg||
nt|brolucius: East knew from the diamond signal from West that he did not hold a singleton spade. Normal to signal suit preference when no further tricks can be taken in the suit led.|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|dburn: for example, Brink may not believe he can give Drijver a spade ruff, because that would mean East's bidding is completely berserk|pg||
nt|pitiful:  surely not Ace|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Alternatively, you can cash @DAK to see if the queen falls, if not go for the ruffing out line|pg||
nt|yuval10: 4@h OR|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|ziff:  The contract could be cold, or he might give away the position|pg||
nt|vasmar: now it makes easily|pg||
nt|andreasw:  dosent matter u have no problm in 2@h x if opp,s have the 4@s|pg||
nt|tomi2:  I am a fan of nfb, but not sure everybody agrees :)|pg||

nt|brolucius: I don't. Important to describe your hand when you are strong.|pg||
nt|brolucius: 4@S a cheap sacrifice but difficult for East when he held so much defence and nothing special in spades. West was in no position to assist.|pg||
nt|yuval10: Poland is now tied with Germany|pg||

nt|odysseus69: not too many entries to South|pg||
nt|bagman: brb|pg||
nt|barnets: had west a short club east would have tried for slam|pg||
nt|idc: The danger is NS will set up a @s for declarer|pg||
pc|h2|nt|paulg:  at least he can pitch a heart on the fourth spade|pg||
nt|hawe45:  120 - next|pg||

pc|hK|pg||
nt|collins64: A@c for the 10@c|pg||
nt|pitiful:  probably watching the cricket with Roland...|pg||
nt|pitiful:  looks like 9 tricks here|pg||
nt|xenya: now 2 hearts pitching 2 diamonds -- that must be his plan?|pg||
nt|ftpe: he probably knows cl 3-3, so maybe will play on clubs|pg||
nt|xenya: but that would lead to a defeat i think -- discarding diamonds i mean|pg||
nt|xenya: and trying to ruff a @D loser in the dimmy|pg||
nt|suketbombi: guessed the @Hs alright|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Iceland has the chance on bd 14|pg||
pc|s3|nt|haans: many plax xx as forcing to at lead 2nt|pg||
nt|brolucius: It will be interesting to see how many pairs reach 7@D. Perhaps a majority at this level.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: now David did you say you wanted to be kept up to date with cricket?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If they believe declarer has a spade stopper, then they should get it right|pg||
nt|idc: and not realize they have @h to cash|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|collins64: and @s|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: creative bidding would  be my guess:)|pg||
nt|paulg:  although not an ideal start to a doubled four-level contract|pg||
nt|haans: just to tease|pg||
nt|barnets: very good system|pg||
nt|psridhar: very tough|pg||
nt|idc: time to count points though|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Easy for us, very difficult at the table|pg||
nt|psridhar: now the odds are with declarer|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Berg can't be sure that declarer has 8 tricks in the minors|pg||
nt|psridhar: Brg will be aware of the running minors however|pg||
nt|idc: but his @d could be 9 high I guess, and defence get 3 @s, @ha and @dK|pg||
nt|psridhar: vul rebid of 2d.....doesnt come on cheese|pg||
pc|sT|nt|vasmar: club was not a success|pg||
nt|star6ija: 3rd trump trick apeared|pg||
nt|corplaw: NS had a spade partial|pg||
nt|corplaw: W should expect that N has no more clubs, since S wouldn't be setting up dummy|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|ziff:  Of course he didn t lead @H8 as he had no idea where @HA is, but it would sure have been fun :)|pg||
nt|psridhar: S will duck dia queen to cut declarer off his hand|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 23/19 getting closer te match |pg||
nt|psridhar: perhpas Fallenius might hv tried 2S over Fredin's 2D- a much better spot than 2nt|pg||

nt|jameslee 2: 2nt a contract you bid but you never play|pg||

nt|Walddk2: sigh|pg||
pc|c2|nt|vasmar: there may be a club spade squeeze|pg||
nt|psridhar: 40-15|pg||
nt|mdgraham: years ago in the Spring Foursomes - partner and I doubled 2@D. The oppo removed, and ended in 4@Dx. Not a success |pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|paulg:  bidding 4@c would have given someone the option of running if doubled (although never easy to work out when to run) ... 4@d has no such safety valve|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Could easily play East for KQ@C doubleton and go for 800|pg||
nt|xenya: well now he MUST discard diamonds on the hearts |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: big smash there fron denmark |pg||
nt|odysseus69: I hear that Hacketts bid 6NT|pg||
nt|bagman: declarer is still going to lose a spade and a diamond|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Back to that slam on 14. At one table where the contract was 6NT, West avoided the diamond lead, but the contract still made when East rose with the ace (low spade from dummy)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: better to win spade ace and take 2 ruffs then diamond jack gets promoted|pg||
nt|idc: Hmm, 3-2-6-2 shape possible?  Maybe 3@c bid is unlikely then|pg||
pc|s5|nt|pitiful:  didn't cash their @s|pg||
nt|tomi2:  as predicted Italy won 3NT over there, dubion exited with a spade and had tempo to try the clubs because he knew the @S split|pg||
nt|j li: Smirnov hat über einenCriss-Cross-Squeeze erfüllt!|pg||
nt|yuval10: Germany are now leading Poland by 10, so Poland is 4 VP's away|pg||
pc|h5|nt|pitiful:  11 now|pg||
nt|psridhar: Bulagria leading italy 33-25 with one Bd o go|pg||
nt|8252: oui, mais entre le chelem de tout à l'heure, et ce 4 @s, la carte se montre méchante cet après midi pour E W|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|rigas_karo: @s cannot go anywhere|pg||
nt|ady: Israel got 11 on board 12  where they could take all the hearts and ace of spades in 3NT|pg||
nt|babs59: the @DJ will be promoted here anyway - or the @D7 even|pg||
nt|riccho: wow|pg||
pc|s7|pg||

nt|riccho: sehr cool|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Italy vs Israel, Poland v Germany in the last round|pg||
nt|barnets: when west is min he bids 3@C|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|petergill: Might be an imp to Sweden here|pg||
nt|jaapfr: the imo sub marginal 1@D creates 2 imps for opps|pg||
nt|eweber: naja, als Problem ist das lächerlich einfach|pg||
nt|barnets: and east can play the hand|pg||
mc|10|nt|Walddk2: A match like this is particularly imprtant because both nations will advance to the finals. VPs against the eight other qualifiers are carried forward|pg||
nt|brolucius: Not a happy moment for the defenders.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Il est ou - le resultat de donne  15|pg||

nt|santyclz: Not in @ds.  A good sign.|pg||

nt|james_h: oooh baby|pg||
nt|ady: this comes home with A@D well placed   and 4 heart tricks coming in|pg||
nt|suketbombi: but it gains tuff to set 2@S while 1Nt will score |pg||
mb|p|nt|andersk: Not any boards from live page updated from this match, yet. I have a feeling 2 boards are misscoored, for +3 IMP to Croatia|pg||
nt|rnmalik: would require good play to make this contract.|pg||
nt|paulg:  As well as starting much later on Saturday, you'll only have 16 board matches in the Seniors|pg||
nt|brolucius: Perhaps you are not English?|pg||
nt|barnets: is 100 a good score at cricket ?|pg||
nt|bagman: maybe that's the explanation|pg||
nt|brolucius: We don't watch javelin throwing on TV, like you do!|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Israel still heading for 19 Iceland 15|pg||
nt|bagman: E was quite sure they were missing nothing after the competitive 3@S bid|pg||
nt|bagman: North was offering South to pick a minor. E knowing that there's also diamond fit is happy to let NS play the suit which sits badly for them|pg||
nt|bagman: West might consider leading any of his major suit cards|pg||
nt|bagman: Is west waiting for east to lead?|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  Presumably to allow more time for a decent bottle in the evening|pg||

nt|Walddk2: In the finals the 9 teams from one group will play against the 9 from the other group and an aggregate score is calculated|pg||
nt|tomi2:  Italy and Iceland have quite confortable leads, they can try to relax in matches agains teams, that will be relegated for sure and save some energy and avoid time penalties (don't know if penalties are also carried into 2nd RR)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Six teams will qualify for the Bermuda Bowl - the top six in the second round-robin. At the moment the field is split into two, so around the top 3 in each section may be seen as ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: the top contenders at present. But there is some luck involved in which of your scores are dropped after the first round-robin.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Penalties are carried forward if both teams qualify, not if only one of them|pg||

nt|bernix: keeping @sK in dummy, just in case he needs a 2nd ruff|pg||
nt|dburn: well judged|pg||
nt|petergill: West needs perfect cards for slam - Axx, AQxx, xxx, Qxx - so she wisely passes  |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: declarer not with many tricks looks an imposible contract|pg||
nt|skaftij:  No, west way to strong 4 4@h|pg||
nt|barnets: personally I am a great admirer of polish bridge and have a chapter about them in my book|pg||
nt|brolucius: A new suit at the one level (1@S) would be non-forcing, even if Lauria had not passed.|pg||
pc|c3|nt|eweber: a festival for the weak NT players who find their @s fit :)|pg||

nt|ftpe: 3 nt was hard bid|pg||
nt|xenya: normal to bid 3N on 25 points, but the game is very thin|pg||
nt|ftpe: punish will come, even if lucky lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Fleisher-Kamil, Weinstein-Levin, Stansby-Martel|pg||
nt|tomi2:  I am not a fan of redoubles with hands that have only one thing to say... "I have support and some values". Redouble for me should mean "I want to double the opps" but it is so unlikely for W that he will get opps...|pg||
nt|brolucius: If you play negative bids over a double, you need to use redouble more - I guess.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Funnily enough this is all about @HQ, is it now?|pg||
nt|othered1: I prefer redouble denies fit, unless game force.|pg||
nt|tomi2:  more often opps will preempt you in spades and partner will not know about your fit when its his turn to bid. You should have a bid in your system to show a constructive or invitational raise directly|pg||
nt|tomi2:  best again is to use transfers :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: transfers are useful in many sequences but no-one ever seems to write a magazine article about them. (Must prefer to keep the advantages to themselves...)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Gromöller is a hot favourite to go down. He must lose two spades and one diamond, and why would he play South for @HQ after the take-out double?|pg||

nt|barnets: why not?|pg||
nt|barnets: 3@H invite with hearts|pg||

nt|bagman: A standard transfer sequence to good 4@S|pg||
nt|brolucius: No mention of 1NT over a double on their card.|pg||
nt|odysseus69: just when nobody wants them we get a run of laydown games|pg||
pc|hA|nt|rnmalik: and thought well:)|pg||
nt|tomi2:  my gues is: his intention was "pd pls bid 3nt with a spade stopper"|pg||
nt|athene: it could easily give tricks away|pg||
nt|athene: i assume that @D4 is the @H4|pg||
nt|hawe45:  East found the shift|pg||
nt|andreasw:  if denmark wins now free beer for all|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: good question Eamon - most events have a final B with the top x teams allowed back in ... not sure|pg||
nt|odysseus69: 9 tricks as long as  he gets trumps right|pg||
nt|udo: ja, weil er 2 Treffs auf Keo loswird|pg||
pc|h2|nt|xenya: N was sort of endplayed on the lead -- any suit he might lead (except @Cs) gives away a trick|pg||

nt|jameslee 2: after @H North will be told where to go after with a signal|pg||
nt|barnets: 4@H I have a good card in your suit|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3@H looks like a bit of a punt on that suit, when vulnerable. Why not 1NT? Jump shifts are invitational.|pg||
nt|cumino: 3NT was a good feeling by Gold|pg||
nt|odysseus69: over 1s- with Axxxxx- dont please tell me this is the way to bid in 2010- it wont catch on in our street|pg||
nt|barnets: agree better to have the  @H10 in north|pg||
nt|brolucius: And the @HJ. |pg||

nt|udo: und das driite Ass wird man jeztt wohl eher Süd geben ?|pg||
nt|udo: wenns zum Raten kommt |pg||
nt|dburn: no, and there is a mention that a jump in a new suit would show five cards with three-card support for partner|pg||
pc|h5|nt|haans: true always is|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: good 4@S if -1 =200 for a 420 opps |pg||
nt|ritong: si ça ne marche pas, il lui restera la solution des @ss|pg||
nt|8252: oui, mais bon coloris, à SA, -10 au lieu de - 11 :)|pg||
nt|ritong: mais ça marchera|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Probably as the double must suggest good defensive values for his weak 2|pg||
nt|odysseus69: I am told that the score on board 9 was probably entered wrongly and 2NT was 1 down|pg||
nt|athene: looks like too much work to do here, with the bad trumps |pg||
pc|h4|nt|paulhac:  Looks like 12 on this lead also|pg||

nt|jameslee 2: but seems a 500 againtx a 420|pg||
nt|mdgraham: after all, can he really underwrite two off?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: how to convert +100 into -730|pg||
nt|skaftij:  switch @s and c and the contract would have been an inelegant 5@s|pg||
pc|hT|nt|mcarroll: not enough dummy entries to trap @HK so will lose 2@D,1@S and the @HK|pg||
nt|haans: sweden DOWN|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3@D should be gf and if so west could have bid 3@S when a slam would be reached|pg||
nt|lechcold: do taryfy chyba brakuje 2 Impów?|pg||
nt|petergill: There are far more hands where 5@H goes down than ones where 6@h makes, excellent judgement by Stockdale|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: I think he will discard a @C|pg||
nt|brolucius: It's a Young Chelsea bid.|pg||

nt|hawe45:  Good bidding system to find 6 @D|pg||
nt|athene: yes, very hard|pg||
nt|santyclz: This is the penultimate bd of the session.  Thanks to the EBU, for providing this for us.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Penultimate - does that mean, that they doÂ´nt play it...?|pg||
nt|athene: the auction in the other room is about how you would expect|pg||
nt|athene: east shows a monster balanced|pg||
nt|athene: west staymans for 4-4 heart fit and then just bids 3nt|pg||
nt|santyclz: Thanks to our operator, Jean-Jacques Thiry, great job!|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: Apparently they replay the board 9, wait for this one soon|pg||

nt|athene: you don't want to play 7@D on a hand like this where it's really likely they will not even bid 6@D in the other room|pg||

nt|tomek: cz, jak widzisz|pg||
nt|vasmar: the overtrick on a ruffing finesse in hearts |pg||
nt|pitiful:  double showing a good raise is increasingly popular here|pg||

nt|jameslee 2: looks a 2@H bid |pg||
nt|ralfwil: with 8 points and @d support|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: lets see if it comes to bright |pg||
nt|ady: if east goes to 5@S   wonder if north will take the bait|pg||
nt|jkotor: 4@s needs both finesses, so 3 is ok|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: this might be some artificial sequence|pg||

nt|barnets: good lead|pg||
nt|barnets: very nice shot|pg||
nt|bagman: North heard enough not to make a 3rd relay|pg||
nt|bagman: West might be thinking doubling this for spade lead|pg||
nt|j li: 3@h wären noch gegangen|pg||
nt|barnets: yes but 4 is ok too vulnerable|pg||
nt|odysseus69: but still needs to find Q - 4D down 1|pg||

nt|marlowepi: etonnant que chemla n'ait pas ouvert la main S sur la  11, selon presque tous les criteres principaux c'est une ouverture nette.|pg||
nt|petergill: Declarer will make 4@S by stripping out the red suits and doing an endplay in clubs, 100% for sure|pg||
nt|petergill: need to play heart to ace and ruff a heart before playing trumps|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@D does|pg||

nt|oleberg: Whack it for 300|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, suddenly the black clouds have cleared away. |pg||
nt|bagman: Without diamond lead, West might have had some chances to make with an endplay|pg||
nt|davidb:  flat  boards -good for Italy|pg||
pc|c7|nt|ady: west wants to clear trumps and then run diamonds|pg||

nt|mdgraham: the 2@c gadget EW play here is very popular in the Netherlands|pg||
nt|ady: down 1 |pg||
nt|jkotor: Sementa is 5@c board 15 after @d lead|pg||
pc|cK|nt|shevek: declarer might sneak 2 @s tricks and 2@h|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2NT= 6+@C-4@D|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2NT shows the diamonds without going past 3@C if that should be partner's preference.|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: is it a straight nock-out |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 9 matches on play |pg||
nt|bagman: In the end he would have elimnated clubs and hearts and can play @DA and another|pg||
pc|s5|nt|paulg:  good lead, although a spade would have had the same effect|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Unless defence set up a @C for declarer, they should come to 2@Hs and 2@Cs|pg||
nt|ftpe: after this lead down i think|pg||
nt|8252: encore une donne ou les distibutions ne sont pas urbaines|pg||
nt|petergill: Sorry, that leaves 2 @d's and 2 clubs to lose - I cannot count|pg||

nt|eweber: 1NT was nf, so much is known|pg||

nt|jkotor: now A@s and K@c|pg||
nt|barnets: they will pick up a double digit swing|pg||

nt|eamongall: they might have even won it but I reckon they definitely medaled|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|tomi2:  don't know where N found a raise to 6 here|pg||
nt|vasmar: probably she thougth that 4@s was a conservative approach|pg||
nt|shevek: can play @hQ now and claim|pg||
nt|bernix: they won it|pg||
nt|jaapfr: if in the endplay you lose 2@D and 2@C it is not really made so need some luck with @CQT|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: who is first will be te winner |pg||
nt|ralfwil: 140/a70 in 3@s so this can go -3|pg||

nt|jaapfr: not if she finesses @CQT|pg||
nt|petergill: NS need @C10, but the don't have it|pg||
nt|petergill: they don't have it|pg||
nt|jaapfr: rite you are|pg||
nt|ralfwil: the @d lead was a killer|pg||
nt|petergill: after the hearts are stripped out, if she plays a club to the 8, EW have to be careful|pg||
nt|rmb1: In OR, defence did not play diamond early and were thrown in late.  But we weren't sure where the tenth trick came from|pg||
nt|petergill: then they have to win @CA, play low @D to W, low @d back to the king, then club|pg||
nt|jillan:  same here, 2 rounds of @S ruff the @H and exit in @D|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Why a killer? opened up the defence|pg||
nt|petergill: If @C6 or @C8, low, low, ducked by @CA, then declarer exits in @D to make |pg||

nt|andreasw:  yes|pg||
nt|haans: yes many are not happy if you do not bid a game that need two finesses|pg||
nt|tomi2:  www.bbotv.com is the link for watching several tables at once, now Sementa is in 4@H but Smirnov lead @CA (after Piekarek found two unforced bid with his ace- and kingless hand)|pg||

nt|petergill: It is bold of the England, with four current World Champions in their team, to play their young new pair (Stockdale - Brown) in this vital match against one of the five top teams. |pg||
nt|petergill: Admittedly Stockdale - Brown are topping the datums with +0.93 imps/bd|pg||

nt|ftpe: withdraw accepted :)|pg||
nt|xenya: and it looks like another disaster for the Russian team is coming|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: well a valiant effort by austria - couldnt do more but apparently not enough so denmark + portugal get thru - finals start tomorrow|pg||

nt|eamongall: name |pg||
nt|davidb: another 24|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: are you going to raise to "a lot"?|pg||
nt|paulg:  a kib suggests at least taking the ace of diamonds to cash five clubs first and then play a diamond ... which saves a trick|pg||
nt|haans: the delay after W bid is because SE are on other side of screen|pg||
nt|ftpe: more imps for estonia here, dont think he can manage|pg||
nt|tomi2:  Piekarek ruffed the 3rd @D with no thought to play a skade, now Sementa will get the @H right I think|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: dziêkujê licznym a znakomitym komentatorom oraz jeszcze bardziej licznym kibicom|pg||
nt|petergill: France has taken a 6 VP lead in the Women's event|pg||
nt|oleberg: West will bid 5@C at some point. Unfortunately, East wont raise|pg||
nt|oleberg: (Unfortunate on this layout)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: what is S thinking of? or is it operator?|pg||
nt|oleberg: It might be West thinking|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I hope so:)|pg||
nt|ady: this is last hand of the session     thx all   interesting hands|pg||
mb|2N|nt|rigas_karo: last hand, good luck to both teams for rest of the tournament|pg||
nt|eweber: looking back all the big imps were won by style, board 8, 9, 14|pg||
nt|paulhac:  True|pg||
nt|tomi2:  now he committes himself to 4 level if pd has no @H fit?|pg||
nt|vasmar: for now Austria gets the lead after the unlucky slam of german|pg||
nt|psridhar: abt 25 % game i reckon ( dia 4-2 wih spd 2-2 also ok)|pg||
nt|oleberg: The oprator cannot use the keyboard before both screenmates have bid|pg||
nt|oleberg: That would give away the tempo|pg||
nt|barnets: England have played quite well this match|pg||
nt|mdgraham: horrible hand for EW to bid|pg||
nt|bagman: 1@S by East was transfer to 1NT denying 4 card major|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: 2nd opinion: Rado: 2@H weak 5+@H4+m 3@C pass or correct|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: Last hand Sweden - Israel hope Spect enjoyed , Thx to Vugragher ; coments by hanns , psridhar &    hope to see you  later on |pg||

nt|jkotor: Cezary chyba nie zrozumia³, ale wysz³o dobrze|pg||
nt|snetram:  dlaczego nie zrozumiaÅ?|pg||
nt|eamongall: Doris Fischer I am told |pg||
nt|petergill: At the other table, the bidding might not have been as it is recorded|pg||
nt|jaapfr: tough decision for N|pg||
nt|petergill: 3NT has chances|pg||
nt|petergill: @D7 is the normal lead to 3NT |pg||
nt|jillan:  may even be easier to play the 4@S|pg||
nt|jaapfr: N considers a 4@C 4@H or pass bid |pg||
nt|jillan:  is west likely to find a heart lead?|pg||
nt|petergill: Other table : 1@D showed hearts and 1@H was takeout of hearts|pg||
nt|petergill: No chance of a @h lead to 3NT - East showed 6 @d's, did not show hearts|pg||
nt|odysseus69: quiet board to finish|pg||
nt|barnets: and it will be a close result|pg||
nt|odysseus69: have to leave- bye all|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3NT not so easy by East.|pg||
mb|3N|nt|motu: wladow does not know bids like 2NT in such situations|pg||
nt|vasmar: but board 19 will give back the lead to Germany i beleive|pg||
nt|MolvaM: last hand of the match here now|pg||
nt|oleberg: West is doing what he can, to get to 6@C|pg||
nt|oleberg: It helps him, that he is limited to 15 points, partner will know the nature of his hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They both have tough opponents in the last round|pg||
mb|p|nt|pitiful:  doubled was the stripe tailed ape|pg||
nt|mamos: wow  was that striped ape do you think|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: thx to our commentators eamonn, justin, bernard - vugraph operator and hope to see you all tomorrow for the finals round 1|pg||
nt|jillan:  so this might make then :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4@C the lesser bid so pass or 4@H|pg||
nt|petergill: West (likely) or East (unlikely) will need to find a heart switch, if East puts up @DK on a low @d elad|pg||
nt|barnets: bye victor|pg||
nt|brolucius: So have the Italians at this table. There was that diamond lead against 3NT and the 7@D that they bid. |pg||
nt|bagman: bye|pg||
nt|ozgull: grand þlem bulundu galiba|pg||
nt|koksoy: 7@S  cok  güzel  kont rat...  karolar  iyiyse  oluyor..  o  ve  pikler  kötü  ama  kör  pasý  geciyor|pg||
nt|suketbombi: last hand comming up thanks David Skaftij and all the wonderful kibzers. Thanks to the Vu-Graph Opertator for the great Job.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lmeili: never argue with DR Waldow :)|pg||
nt|reisig: disaster coming|pg||
nt|haans: dont ask|pg||
nt|vasmar: S is happy to pass|pg||
nt|roswolf: east will pass?he is normally very reluctant to pass an invitation|pg||
nt|mcarroll: on 19 4@S was made in Open, to account for most of the lead held by Bulgaria|pg||
nt|pitiful:  or at least he will claim that later|pg||
nt|jaapfr: @H|pg||
nt|yusufb: seninkiler %1 zaten|pg||

nt|petergill: Might be hard (impossible) to put @DK on 1D!0 = unlucky|pg||
nt|oleberg: 5NT = Pick a slam (I sincerely hope)|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer has only one entry to dummy as the club finesse is not working|pg||
nt|barnets: so closer match good for the competition|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Italy v Israel and Poland v Germany|pg||
nt|yuval10: last board of this championship then - quite safe to say congrats for Italy for 1st place|pg||
nt|brolucius: Potential double-game swing here.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mamos: lol|pg||
nt|MolvaM: many thanks to all our commentators and our specs for their valuable guidance|pg||
nt|haans: 3@S must have been premptive|pg||
nt|marlowepi: je m'etonne a la ligne de jeu, notamment le deuxieme tour d'atout avant de jouer trefle et coeur pour limiter la note si les atouts sont mal partages|pg||
nt|dburn: I doubt even this East could make 3NT on these cards|pg||
pc|h9|nt|andersk: calm finish, so the results as it stands now, is 15-15 in VP|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Its Stayman Jim, but not as we know it?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a @h lead was Killing|pg||
nt|jaapfr: duck??|pg||
nt|petergill: @D5 = discouraging, as South is "marked' with @DAQJ|pg||
nt|skaftij:  Thx vugraph operator, fellow commentaros Raju and David and specs not least|pg||
nt|odysseus69: even if fine player|pg||
pc|hA|nt|ady: might be 1 too high    depends on view in trumps|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: very much so 0-6  4 card is the maximum preempitve |pg||
nt|psridhar: but that 3s worked in pushing Freding into the startosphere 4D|pg||
nt|yuval10: As Poland fading, Israel might have a chance for 2nd place|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|tomi2:  trump lead|pg||
nt|lechcold: wygl¹da ¿e mo¿emy Holendrom odpisaæ jeszcze kilka VP|pg||
nt|petergill: This swing will halve the margin|pg||
nt|oleberg: Payback for board 14, where Iceland in open room bid and made a very lucky 6@S|pg||
nt|ralfwil: W will make this, so thanks all and I wish you all a nice Wednesday evening:)|pg||
nt|bagman: W strongly suspecting that the @DQ is wrong|pg||
nt|jkotor: Israel only 8.5 vp before Iceland for 3rd|pg||
nt|barnets: israel were in great form|pg||
nt|tokay1975: also first 6 seat goes to bermuda bowl|pg||
pc|h7|nt|xenya: N doubled on slender values but 4-4-4-1, and S was happy to pass|pg||
nt|koksoy: 5 @C  diyerek  trefl  haric  aslarý  sordu .. 5nt=  2as  ve  dam  var..  artýk  7  demek  kolay|pg||
pc|h8|nt|eweber: if I weren't an aggressive bidder I would consider to convert after watching this match :)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  i would like to back to board 4 and 11 tricks was made!!!!!:)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: thanks andreas, nicoleta|pg||
nt|chick: This is the last board for this table,  3 yet to score|pg||
nt|mdgraham: maybe West could rebid 1NT, but personally I loathe it - any preferences? 2@d seems normal enough |pg||
nt|ozgull: kýsmet 7 karo dediler|pg||
nt|koksoy: cok  güzel  konustular|pg||
nt|ozgull: bir önceki el yani|pg||
nt|koksoy: yapma  ya..|pg||

pc|h6|nt|pitiful:  great hand to finish with|pg||
nt|pitiful:  well done to the dutch, they played very well|pg||
nt|pitiful:  after a slow start they are motoring |pg||
nt|mamos: the idea is you double 5 Level to stop them bidding Six then if they redouble you vanish to your save like a stripe tailed ape vanishing up a tree|pg||
nt|aldek: anyhow, great entertainment|pg||
nt|pitiful:  thanks to all watching|pg||
nt|pitiful:  bye now|pg||
nt|mamos: yes thsanks all|pg||

nt|ralfwil: bye!|pg||
nt|oleberg: And a nice vening to you and everybody else|pg||
nt|odysseus69: until they lost to Iceland this morning they were unbeaten in 2nd stage|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|athene: thanks all...|pg||
nt|maribelxx: another reason for the day being quiet is midsummer... all shops are closed, no public transport, people flee from cities to spend a few days in the country|pg||
nt|chick: Thanks to our excellent vugraph operator,  Michel Machiels, for a great job!!  :)|pg||
nt|jkotor: po pasie uzna³, ¿e ka¿da licytacja MUSI byæ z fitem|pg||
nt|ritong: il faudrait verifier si une ligne de jeu " méfiante" ne risque pas le contrat en cas de partages normaux|pg||
nt|marlowepi: il y avait une probabilite miniscule que N ait 5 coeurs (crainte de promotion d'atout), car il avait passe en troisieme aux couleurs favorables et il a deja le roi de pique en ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: plaus de ses coeurs--au moins|pg||
nt|ritong: bien  allons voir ce qui se passe dans l autre salle|pg||
nt|brolucius: Ah, I am much indebted to some kibitzers for suggesting that it may be an operator mistake.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|rnmalik: good bridge, 20 boards and such little difference.|pg||
nt|paulhac:  North might well have bid over 2@H|pg||
nt|ady: good guess|pg||
nt|maribelxx: sorry :(|pg||
nt|santyclz: Thanks all, see you soon.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: ok andreas we analyze that board and send you the results by a sealed envelope|pg||
nt|tomi2:  not difficult after Piekarek has told him his exact shape...|pg||
nt|jaapfr: i would at least think a longer time as E to see how this can go down on trick 1|pg||
nt|odysseus69: looks normal auction|pg||
nt|koksoy: simdi  düsünüyor  ama  birazdan  hýzlanacak|pg||
nt|koksoy: artýk  kör  pasý  mecburi|pg||
nt|bagman: To make declarer needs luck in both spades and clubs|pg||
nt|jkotor: I think Poland is in good shape in stage 3|pg||
nt|jkotor: stage 1|pg||
nt|jkotor: stage 2, sorry|pg||
nt|jkotor: over 20 vp average till this match|pg||
pc|dA|nt|haans: 9.30 central time tomorrow|pg||
nt|shevek: thx Murat, Andreas, everyone|pg||
nt|andreasw:  :) thx everyone was fun|pg||
nt|MolvaM: this room is finished. everybody invited to the Open room to finish the match. thanks...|pg||
nt|andreasw:  bye everyone|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: other table playing 2nt west |pg||
nt|brolucius: If the @DK lead picks up a big number we will have a near-draw, very creditable. |pg||
nt|barnets: for those interested in extraordinary bridge stories , scandal and hands I have anew wbsite at www.shenkinbridge.com and a club free to join|pg||
nt|bagman: now he probably goes 3 down making only his 4 top tricks he had in the beginning|pg||
nt|odysseus69: Netherlands have Jumped into top 6 so now 7th is enough to qualify|pg||
nt|jkotor: thx all|pg||
nt|barnets: switch to open room now|pg||
nt|barnets: tx all specs for your messages|pg||
nt|eweber: netter|pg||
nt|odysseus69: thx all|pg||
pc|d7|nt|eweber: this is the last board on this table, but we will have the chance to watch the last 5 in the open|pg||
nt|psridhar: that 2nt wont be a success either|pg||
nt|ralfwil: sry for my break. serious net problems (WAN)|pg||
nt|bagman: South should not consider ducking this because he still has the @C9|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|ralfwil: When I see the figures, perhaps as well as a swede:)|pg||
nt|bagman: The defense need to play spades at some point so declarer is likely to go only 2 down|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ady: thx all|pg||
