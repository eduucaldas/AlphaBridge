mb|p|nt|yuval10: N in the OR also opened 1@h |pg||
nt|ralfwil: I think it´s a she Mike|pg||
pc|c4|nt|yannis3012: begining with a difficult 3nt to make|pg||
nt|star6ija: 17-18 direct 1 N, 19-20 via 1h|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: well they scaped from that one |pg||
nt|ralfwil: the only positive for ns is that it´s undoubled|pg||
nt|oleberg: 3 down could be possible, but requires accurate defence|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: all the key cards are badly placed K@H,K@S,AQ@C|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|peachy: EW system is 4-card majors, light style 14-16 and 15-17NT. NS is Transfer Walsh 15-17NT|pg||
nt|athene: tricky hand to play - ruffing diamond finesse is a possibility|pg||
nt|bagman: There are lot's of high cards out and E passed and W opened weak|pg||
nt|athene: the problem is that ruffing diamond finesse might not be that useful, even if the king is with east|pg||
nt|athene: because if the @DQ is covered you have to use the @CA to get back there for a fast pitch of the heart|pg||
nt|athene: and that gives up on a double club finesse|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer wants a quick discards and wants to play the clubs for one loser|pg||
nt|athene: it's possible he might put all his eggs in one basket and take a normal diamond finesse; i.e. lead to the queen|pg||
nt|bagman: W  has shown up with @HKQ, does he have @DK and @CH?|pg||
nt|athene: the other issue is, you aren't necessarily going all-out to make|pg||
nt|athene: if it risks incurring two or three additional vulnerable undertricks|pg||
nt|bagman: S vulnerable he needs to make as many tricks as possible unless he has 9 safe|pg||
nt|bagman: He has likely 3 spade losers and a club|pg||
nt|athene: not at all an easy decision for south here|pg||
nt|athene: i prefer to open these hands 2@S first time|pg||
nt|athene: passing might appear safer but you often end up having to take more of a risk later at a higher level|pg||
nt|bagman: If he takes the straight diamond finesse, he needs to play @S to the Q|pg||
nt|athene: he knows the points are split fairly evenly between east and west|pg||
nt|bagman: Hoping for Jx KQxxx Kxx Qx or similar leaving E AKx xx xxx Kxx|pg||
nt|athene: west has weak-2 and east can't open - that doesn't leave much room for variation, with 21 hcp missing|pg||
nt|athene: the only problem is, there are a lot of variations in which cards each defender has|pg||
nt|bagman: If he places KQ of hearts and @DK west, he is quite restricted to place the rest for a make|pg||
nt|andreasw:  only lead is @S if u dont want to give any trick's|pg||
nt|haans: South do not liked it|pg||
nt|othered1: hi!|pg||
nt|lesniak: teraz musza zmienic na kiera|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|lmeili: 4N shows 6 4?|pg||
nt|ziff:  Looks like the par contract|pg||
nt|yuval10: so no swing in a rather dangerous board |pg||
nt|yuval10: Israeli open for instance opened 1@c and played it wrong-sidedly, going down 1|pg||
nt|aldek: it can be made, but unlikely|pg||
nt|cameron_1: yes|pg||
nt|mdgraham: looking at the banner, you can be dead certain|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the W is a clue|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|roswolf: another thinnish game reached|pg||
nt|haans: landed fair|pg||
nt|poohbear: trump lead and its over|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: yes not easy|pg||
nt|haans: Hi Barry wlc|pg||
nt|poohbear: sorry|pg||
nt|poohbear: dont mean to chat|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: hi barry|pg||
nt|udo: 4 @H fails , even finding @H Queen doubleton is not enough|pg||
nt|udo: no entries for the 2 top-spades for diamond discards|pg||
nt|brolucius: East expects six hearts for a 2@H rebid that bypasses so many alternative rebid. Hence the raise.|pg||
nt|udo: hm, only 2 clublooses|pg||
nt|udo: losers|pg||
nt|othered1: with @CJ on, this does make (6@H, 2@S, 1@D, 1@C)|pg||
nt|udo: small @H to jack will be enough|pg||
nt|othered1: or win in dummy, pitch @C, hook rounded suits|pg||
nt|othered1: sorry, pitch @D|pg||
nt|udo: or 2 discards after heart to the jack|pg||
nt|othered1: (Ignore me, I'll awaken shortly)|pg||
nt|udo: jack of clubs is the important card, and it is well placed|pg||
nt|udo: same here:)|pg||
nt|udo: good morning ED:)|pg||
nt|tomi2:  I think they should not have bid that game, IMO east should have passed 2@H|pg||
nt|brolucius: At last I have managed to find a Lauria-Versace convention card. The 2NT response on Board 1 was a limit bid in partner's major. More often nowadays, 2NT shows a game-forcing ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: raise.|pg||
nt|8252: les 2 derniers matche sdes français comptent donc double, puisque Bulgare et allemands seront au tour suivant|pg||
nt|ralfwil: except @dK:)|pg||
nt|oleberg: A switch to the @DQ is the first step towards -3|pg||
nt|oleberg: And it must beducked|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|andreasw:  u can also selved @d self but would problebly go wrong|pg||
nt|aap00: now decl have to guess @c - sur ehe will|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: good lead by East |pg||
nt|haans: a killer|pg||
pc|d4|nt|haans: i do not like prempts over prempts|pg||
nt|h_karluk: they missed 6@d by N|pg||
nt|lesh: the dbl is asking for the type of hand and 3@c is min hand with 6+clubs|pg||
nt|lesniak: wietna zrzutka Adama|pg||
nt|oleberg: Unless I've missed an endplay|pg||
nt|oleberg: A third round of clubs will promote a heart trick, but diamonds have to be cashed first|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: Est will duck nice defence only if he is nervous to play a quick 2 nd @C|pg||
nt|oleberg: And spades|pg||

nt|Walddk2: and 14-16 against Hungary today|pg||
nt|tomi2:  was his intention to duck the 10 or overtake?|pg||
nt|othered1: EW system is described as Swiss-ACOL.   I'm not sure how limited the 2@H bid was.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Duck, I expect, to set up the @HJ (or avoid losing a trump trick). Unlikely that they would duck @HQ - but possible at this level.|pg||

nt|bagman: If he places the @DK east, he has probably some better chances to make|pg||

nt|mdgraham: would it be possible to have the player names please operator? |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: well a bit of air for North|pg||

nt|brolucius: Of which only 15 understand what pedant means. (I will have to look it up...)|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h2|nt|eweber: as I just see Russia is playing with Khiuppenen-Kholomeev in the closed room, NL with Wijs-Muller|pg||

pc|c9|pc|h6|nt|ady: may be a swing for Israel|pg||

pc|c5|pc|c3|pc|cJ|pc|cK|pg||

mb|p|nt|mcarroll: So no problem then :)|pg||
nt|udo: everybodys choice?|pg||
nt|brolucius: The play on the last deal is one that you often see in book (sacrificing a trump trick to gain an entry to two winners). Less often at the table.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lmeili: not me|pg||
nt|roswolf: hearts will be the chosen trump suit i'm sure|pg||
nt|MolvaM: hi :)|pg||
nt|andreasw:   Haraldsson got scared?|pg||

pc|h8|nt|h_karluk: pre vs pre + un vs un are useful toys|pg||
nt|ady: should not be if in a slam|pg||
nt|roswolf: maybe not -|pg||
nt|bagman: Now S must do something|pg||
nt|athene: it might be hard for NS to diagnose they hold a diamond stopper betwen them|pg||

nt|bagman: I wonder what 1NT would have shown by S |pg||
nt|star6ija: board 1|pg||

nt|athene: south really likes his hand after his partner's free 2@C rebid|pg||
nt|bagman: Interesting 3@H|pg||
nt|bagman: cannot be natural|pg||
nt|athene: he is looking for 3nt - prepared to play 4@C if necessary|pg||

nt|jameslee 2: the bid is on the limit ·3@H |pg||
nt|haans: but all will get higher|pg||

nt|chick: yes, jivko, but @DA and small trump still doesn't hurt in that case|pg||

nt|justin c: this double not to everybody's taste|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: no move after openning |pg||
nt|oleberg: EW plays 2@S as a strong-weak 2@S, while 2@D would be a weak-weak 2@S (or@H)|pg||
pc|h9|nt|motu: 2@D is 15-19 with any onesuiter or 20-21 NT|pg||

nt|aap00: say u have 6 for KJx vs 4 for J10x, but believe that 50% times W will play K with KJx => 3 vs 4 remaining|pg||
nt|haans: normal today|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 1@D meaning  4 card @H|pg||
nt|lesh: but still a trump finess seems to be the best line|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lmeili: if @c lead & guss wrong of @s|pg||

nt|antoniz: farcik jest:)|pg||
nt|lechcold: mniam:)|pg||
nt|snetram:  zabawne|pg||
nt|mdgraham: NS strong club, variable NT; EW 5M, weak NT, 1@C may be weak NT|pg||
nt|mdgraham: first blood to Sweden on board 1 - the Swedish EW made 6@s|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|andersk: I beleve 2 @C is drury with 3 card|pg||
nt|aap00: no cards for 6 |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 2@S shape & points |pg||
nt|justin c: as a passed hand, West might have stretched to 2@D |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: first duck from declarer to open comunication |pg||
nt|oleberg: Declarer will probaly try to "scramble"; getting his small thrumphs home|pg||
pc|d3|nt|eweber: and of those 10 teams 6+NL will play in the Bermuda Bowl|pg||
nt|andersk: Has to switch @D or @C noe, I predeict @D|pg||
nt|ady: this needed a major suit lead |pg||
nt|kdr_fm: nothing breaking (well @C 5/4) this is going off a few|pg||
nt|oleberg: Instead of trying to drawthrumphs, and control the hand|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|bagman: quiet lookin partial, declarer probably making 9 tricks|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 3@H  6 card |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 4@H end |pg||
nt|lesh: unfortunately for E/W 4@s is making|pg||
pc|dA|nt|yuval10: did well here, and in the OR as well|pg||
nt|MolvaM: running scores http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/runningscores/asp/roundteamsconditstatclassicmod.asp?qtournid=819&qshowflag=1|pg||
nt|MolvaM: norths 2@c could be the gazilli convention that several pairs play these days|pg||
nt|MolvaM: showing either a natural @c rebid or some sort of strong hand|pg||
nt|ftpe: hearts 5-2, so only 5 spades here|pg||
nt|aap00: so 4 is reasonable contract|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer has some sort of chance to ditch a diamond on one of the black suits. A diamond finesse and a heart break would then give him a chance.|pg||
nt|brolucius: South's signal on the top-club lead deterred Lauria from cashing his other high club, thereby giving declarer a diamond discard. Buit the @DK is wrong anyway.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Vladimir was in Warsaw Poland in 2006 and in Antalya 2007 with reasonable ranking, however this time surprised to his line|pg||
nt|h_karluk: *Antalya Turkiye|pg||

nt|h_karluk: he is supposed to count and protect himself endplayed|pg||
nt|roswolf: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/runningscores/asp/roundteamsconditstatclassicmod.asp?qtournid=820&qshowflag=1|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, 11 tricks|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s2|nt|eweber: o.k., sorry|pg||
nt|davidb: good stop as 3NT -only 8 tricks|pg||
nt|santyclz: 6 imps to France on board 2 for going + in both rooms.  |pg||
nt|othered1: it's difficult to stay out of this game, unless west opens strong NT and east chooses not to act, vulnerable.|pg||
nt|lesh: should take much longer before claiming|pg||
nt|andersk: Kinda stragne 2 @C and 4@H bid from Charlie here, I would prefeer 4@H over 1 @H opening, isnt that what the hand is wurth?|pg||
nt|lesh: certainly 4@H would do the job. I dont think North would dbl|pg||
nt|mdgraham: this might make, or it might go down - that covers most possibilities |pg||
nt|mdgraham: but should make now, even if NS get a spade ruff, as a diamond can be discarded on @CK|pg||
nt|ralfwil: walter the valrus had made this easy - double with a voice of thunder - (Mollo)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|andersk: agree|pg||
nt|ftpe: he now|pg||
nt|aap00: in brd 2 W(!) pushed to 3nt... |pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|h_karluk: declarer for sure would try long string|pg||
nt|haans: the more @D he plays the better defense|pg||
nt|h_karluk: we will see |pg||
pc|sT|nt|andersk: 990 now|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Will make now. If S tries to get a @s ruff a @d will disapperar on @cK and if NS takes their @d tricks, no communication|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|chick: bypassing drury may have some kind of subtle implication about strength|pg||
pc|c7|nt|Gerben42: changed from last time and will change again next time I guess|pg||
nt|andreasw:  3nt 11 trick's finessing @d|pg||
nt|othered1: i.e, it's a game virtually everyone will get to|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|athene: lauria's negative double over 2@D warned south off getting involved with his spade suit|pg||
nt|oleberg: Then again, he might not :)|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: bad news has arrived from the trumps|pg||
nt|oleberg: Nridge is easier, when you can see all four hands|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|aap00: for me strange, with 10hcp and passed pd |pg||
nt|haans: not easy clubs finesse|pg||
pc|dK|nt|lmeili: if S ducks @dA|pg||
nt|bagman: I would guess that declarer discards a club on the hearts and gives 2 spades and 2 hearts|pg||
nt|athene: Sementa is prepared to lose his @HK to hold declarer to one heart winner rather than two|pg||
nt|bagman: Sementa's duck gives defense 3 spades instead of 2 spades|pg||
nt|brolucius: A high spot-card (@C7) is discouraging, against both suit and NT contracts. (Reverse attitude).|pg||
nt|justin c: leaving the @C suit blocked to keep entry to @HQJ|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a @s lead was defeating|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mcarroll: I agree - lets the defence signal very comfortably|pg||
nt|h_karluk: the only possibility to make this a thrown-in play with misdefense of West|pg||
nt|aap00: so, "well deserved" -5 impls|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|haans: @H6 even|pg||
pc|hT|nt|peachy: NS 1H opening might not be everybody's choice, but they play 4-card majors, light style|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: he will ruff a @H & open the clubs guess !|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|peachy: oops, he overcalled!|pg||
nt|ziff:  I must confess that I would not sell the E hand as 9+, but Entscho s judgement has always been somewhat different....|pg||
nt|h_karluk: pitch the spade and lose the board|pg||
pc|s4|nt|MolvaM: this is a 630 or 660 hand for the field to rest their grey cells|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Thor Erik was in San Remo 2009, i guess evil made him do that double|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|andersk: will probably go down|pg||
nt|oleberg: Well, a double with a voice of thunder might not have been good. It might make if nort's strength is known|pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: he will carry on with the time-honoured antidote to a 4-4 trump fit - keep leading trumps|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer can play N to have AQx and make now 10 tricks|pg||
pc|c4|nt|peachy: ignore everything I said, please :)|pg||
nt|bagman: Or W can let N to have @SQ|pg||
nt|athene: declarer probably thinks the club is offside|pg||
nt|athene: he will try and endplay north|pg||
nt|athene: duck another spade now, perhaps|pg||
nt|bagman: The @C-finesse working is an extra bonus|pg||
nt|andersk: maybe, I cant see what damage ¤@H direct might couse|pg||
pc|cK|nt|xenya: i'm told there are no commentators in the open room, so I think i'll switch over there|pg||
nt|ftpe: now he plays safe|pg||
nt|aap00: oh, yes me too |pg||
nt|kdr_fm: W praying that @dT9 .... arghhh :>|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|haans: they do not show count|pg||
nt|andersk: Time to give @c count for East now|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c6|nt|haans: @DK must be cover both other suits|pg||
nt|andreasw:  now take @d finesse|pg||
nt|aap00: thotught it's OR :) |pg||

pc|s6|nt|justin c: @D9, north pitches blocking @CJ|pg||

nt|haans: most swedes 8 = odd |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: he guessed correctly doing his best |pg||
pc|d9|nt|shevek: in bd 2 (the mirror hand) Iceland gained 12 imps|pg||

nt|haans: no a copunt|pg||
pc|d7|nt|athene: ok well done|pg||
pc|s3|nt|bagman: Now the endplay in spades for 10 tricks|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mcarroll: Obviously listening to you Anders :)|pg||
nt|andersk: abot time:)|pg||
nt|andersk: about|pg||
nt|h_karluk: then declarer wld be a @h less and a @c more|pg||
nt|h_karluk: as @c K favorably placed always makes, west doesn't need to care signals|pg||
nt|h_karluk: just count it out more and make fine judgement|pg||
nt|andreasw:  claim|pg||
nt|udo: would be down now, even with !J diamond in the finesse?|pg||

pc|h2|pc|h7|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hQ|pc|hK|pc|s3|pg||
nt|othered1: NS play sound raises (8-10, I think).  Overcall made north's judgment easy.|pg||
nt|henryb:  With 6-4 and good primes, he would have at least tried in any case|pg||
nt|othered1: Might north play west for @S shortness?|pg||
nt|othered1: Even if north would lose @S finesse to west, still 10 tricks with nice minor suit distributions|pg||
nt|sastro: he is going to play @s King and finesse to the 9|pg||
nt|jillan:  agree with Dirk|pg||
nt|othered1: But without 52 cards in view, north has many considerations, especially if he assumes west has some distribution for his 3@H bid|pg||

nt|MolvaM: 1 more match today and 6 matches the next days|pg||
nt|MolvaM: top 9 ranked teams will qualify for the second stage|pg||
nt|MolvaM: then teams will play a round robin with the teams coming from the other group|pg||
nt|ftpe: south is looking for 6 spades, but cant win here|pg||
nt|haans: 3@C full of danger|pg||
nt|haans: 2@D may have been trf|pg||
nt|haans: more logical|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: not in this position |pg||
nt|haans: but bidding @D twice is?|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: but one never knows in this game |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: what a parnership can bild up |pg||
nt|psridhar: Hi all|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: big think there by N |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: hi |pg||
nt|haans: only 40 hcp exist|pg||
nt|psridhar: two high class pairs facing each other -should be an absorbing contest|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 5@D can be made true will see where he ends up|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|rnmalik: but for the @S finesse had a good chance to make it.|pg||
nt|roswolf: never likely to be bid though|pg||
nt|brolucius: You see how light South's 2@S response is. Everyone does that nowadays, to allow partner to compete if he has extra trump-length. In the Bad Old Days, a raise to 2@S was considered ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: a 'free bid' (particularly in the USA) and promised a king's ransom.|pg||
nt|udo: and 4 @S NS  |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 3@D= bergen |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 4@S = 10/11 tricks |pg||
pc|c2|nt|Gerben42: if thats not a minimum hand I never saw one|pg||
nt|davidb: normal  450 . will be flat all over I believe|pg||
nt|haans: yes both both clear for second rr|pg||
nt|brolucius: Italy has reached game on 4, I am told.|pg||
pc|c9|nt|mcarroll: Lebensohl|pg||
nt|andersk: must be the best weak 2 ever|pg||
nt|yuval10: 4+|pg||
nt|tomi2:  Hackett raised to 3@S with only 3 cad support. I play a cuebid by overcaller as 3 card support raise with maximum here, so 3@S would always be 4 cards for me|pg||
nt|yuval10: seem like a nice agreement|pg||
nt|yuval10: you have to play over the @h's in 4@s|pg||
nt|yuval10: Alfredo Versace is going down in 4@s in his match|pg||

nt|haans: yepsry|pg||
nt|yuval10: means that this contract isn't so easy |pg||
nt|mamos: this all looks odd|pg||
nt|MolvaM: while the results from their own group will be carried over|pg||
nt|xenya: well if N just had @HA instead of the King... |pg||
nt|lesh: 2@c prec, 2@s non forcing.However South has a decent hand he tried 4@s|pg||
nt|lesh: it also put pressure on the oppoinents and they might as here bid 5@d|pg||
nt|snetram:  moÅ¼e byÄ imponujacy wyÅcig, ale nie musi|pg||
nt|jkotor: E bêdzie musia³ nadbijaæ kara|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: Assuming 4@d shows a good 4@s bid maybe with 3 trumps and 4 iron clad tricks N is worth a 4@h Slam try ...|pg||
pc|c8|nt|eweber: 2NT was nat, nf|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I would open 1 @S with that hand|pg||

nt|ryskiel_: Armstrong or Contador?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I vote for 12|pg||
pc|cT|nt|peachy: with trumps not splitting, this will be tough to play, unless of course EW bids again (I doubt it)|pg||
nt|wygbe1: 6d is pretty  good, but the cards are not friendly|pg||
nt|lmeili: 3@c says 9+ red cards not min hand|pg||
nt|lmeili: tx Rado, 3@s may show sington @c|pg||
nt|tomi2:  what would you lead here?|pg||
nt|lmeili: probably @d, not @s not @h not @c|pg||
nt|tomi2:   seems to cause communication problems, but I cant Imagine to lead a @D from jxx|pg||
nt|motu: i guess i would lead a@H|pg||
nt|tomi2:  seems like a good idea too, in case S has also a singleton you cut this communication|pg||
nt|ziff:  I hope for a @D (obviously), but would lead a @H myself|pg||
nt|motu: with 3@C showing 9 red cards a @D lead looks unatraktiv for me|pg||

nt|Gerben42: Rudakov removed because of the @S problem, not because of his good suit|pg||
nt|wygbe1: play off 3 top clubs pitching h's and let e ruff|pg||
nt|peachy: declarer is likely to adopt that line, but then he has to deal with the H, S and club losers in hand|pg||
nt|peachy: might turn out too tuff|pg||
nt|wygbe1: yes, the line that works is to just ruff the 2 low clubs in dummy and draw trumps, finessing against d jack|pg||
nt|wygbe1: even that could run into difficulty|pg||
nt|h_karluk: oh yes, now i liked more Lawrence's Law of total tricks |pg||

mb|1H|nt|Gerben42: weak 2 in @D|pg||
nt|Gerben42: refreshingly natural|pg||
nt|eweber: there is a tiny little chance of an endplay vs South|pg||
nt|wygbe1: guess i missed something, down 1 looked pretty easy|pg||
nt|yuval10: really hard to predict what the final outcome here will be|pg||
nt|tomi2:  am no fan of double and no fan of redouble here. what contract does Della Monta want to play doubled, iff ops bid it?|pg||
nt|yuval10: X from S is dangerous in the sense that sometimes P will pass and you have very few defensive tricks for him|pg||
nt|tomi2:  yes|pg||
nt|roswolf: another straightforward board|pg||
nt|bagman: p-p|pg||
nt|athene: 2@S must be a takeout |pg||
nt|bagman: S is confident in his methods|pg||
nt|athene: takeout of spades|pg||
nt|fokal: 2@d shows @s , strong or weak|pg||
nt|fokal: hi all by the way|pg||
nt|athene: maybe 2@S is specifically michaels|pg||
nt|bagman: Is it T/O or 2-suiter?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi.|pg||
nt|athene: many pairs play "leaping michaels" over these bids, so 4@D would be reds|pg||
nt|bagman: hi|pg||
nt|fokal: so I guess 2@s shows a two suiters for sure|pg||
nt|athene: maybe NS don't play that or maybe south prefers to treat his hand as a 3-suiter|pg||
nt|bagman: N has an easy raise of the q-bid :)|pg||
nt|bagman: if methods permit such treatment|pg||
nt|hawe45:  So - I was late from another match|pg||
nt|athene: north pretty much just wants to RKCB in hearts|pg||
nt|athene: but he might have to set hearts first|pg||
nt|MolvaM: double now?|pg||
nt|andreasw:  1@s and 4@h after 3nt|pg||
nt|udo: 7@D|pg||
nt|udo: or NT|pg||
nt|udo: lets see|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is natural to bid 4@H rather than 5@C because it is a trick less. When the opponents go to 4@S and you want to bid at the five-level, you have a free choice between hearts and ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: clubs.|pg||
nt|8252: tu as donc 2 pseudos|pg||
nt|ralfwil: As you said Mike a classic preempt with a good result|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: denmark on lead 8-0 Iceland|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: hand nº 6 |pg||
nt|oleberg: 1@D shows 11-15, 4+ diamonds, can have longer clubs|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: seems a 4@H by West|pg||
nt|oleberg: (No, I'm not guessing :))|pg||
mb|3S|nt|yuval10: i agree with those 2 arguments you made|pg||
nt|shevek: neither side can make game|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 3nt seems not makable|pg||
nt|tomi2:  lauria only needs to find partner with two aces here, should be possible to find|pg||
mb|p|nt|ziff:  In a marked contrast to our table Scotland and Italy have won 40 and 46 IMP in 5 boards.....|pg||
nt|lmeili: they should reach to 4@h, 1@c-1@d , 1N 2@c|pg||
nt|tomi2:  sometimes pd will jump to 2 level with 4 cards only and you have a hard bidding later|pg||
nt|tomi2:  os della Monatas hand now worth a raise to 6?|pg||
nt|yuval10: i believe W must add now....P is willing to play in the 5 level ALONE when he's VUL, and you have AK A?|pg||
nt|tomi2:  AKtx of trumps and the ace in their suit?|pg||
nt|yuval10: *she's|pg||
nt|yuval10: very likely that we'll see a sacrifice from NS|pg||
nt|tomi2:  if S bids 5@D now w has a difficult bid|pg||
nt|yuval10: Pass forcing?|pg||
nt|tomi2:  E-W are clearly in a forcing pass situation, but do you pass with TWO small dias?|pg||
nt|roswolf: unless n/s get carried away|pg||
nt|davidb: yes  no  great  boards yet...|pg||
nt|ady: can make 6NT    6@S  beaten on heart lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: the axe might descend here|pg||
nt|davidb: ??  aces...|pg||
nt|bagman: Ok, now let's see how the void is shown|pg||
nt|cameron_1: might chooce 4@s since Drijver's X was prob snapfragon style i.e. 2@s 5@c|pg||
nt|aldek: double showing clubs and a doubleton spade|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@D is natural. She has one diamond, so opens One Diamond.|pg||
nt|oleberg: And a good save in 4@S|pg||
nt|oleberg: Ok, a save|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: a block 3@S by N|pg||
mb|4S|nt|athene: it's never easy to bid a grand slam which depends on a void (i.e. where you are off an ace)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: still a possible 5 imps missed|pg||
mb|5H|nt|eweber: but NS can escape by cashing their tricks|pg||
nt|lmeili: 2@h 3@h|pg||
nt|haans: close to spade raise|pg||
nt|yuval10: you have to do something with this AKTX trump and A@h|pg||
nt|cameron_1: choose a game i guess, a little strange because most use that to claim "ownership" and show a good hand|pg||
nt|mamos: what strength was 2@h   do we know - forcing ?|pg||
nt|mamos: will england bid on ?|pg||
nt|andreasw:  3nt should not win yes|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: could East X ?|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: can it be 3 card suport?|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: West can go alone to 5@H|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 5@H=11 tricks |pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: he ruffed H with the Q, unnecessary|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like another boring hand|pg||
nt|lechcold: dziêki wejciu Brinka nasi dojd¹ do 3BA|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: empting to Dbl with S hand|pg||
nt|peachy: tempting|pg||
nt|andersk: If 5@C makes, then 3 NT makes too|pg||
nt|bagman: If N can ask aces, S can bid quite a lot|pg||
nt|athene: did south think 4nt was asking for the minor?|pg||
nt|fokal: sementa has no idea of the @s void , he might try to protect his K of @s|pg||
nt|fokal: by bidding NT|pg||
nt|bagman: Now 5@S, I guess|pg||
nt|fokal: obvisously S interpreted 4NT as 'what is your minor , partner ? '|pg||
nt|athene: they might scramble into the grand if south finds 5@S now|pg||
nt|hawe45:  What was 2 @S exactly?|pg||
nt|bagman: It's bad to have your misunderstanding on a grand slam deal|pg||
nt|athene: but if there really has been a misunderstanding it's asking a lot to recover and go on to bid a tricky seven|pg||
nt|athene: 2@D showed spades, weak or strong (or some monster balanced)|pg||
nt|athene: so 2@S was obviously a cue - whatever they play that as|pg||
nt|hawe45:  So 5 @S now might do...|pg||
nt|cameron_1: i imagine tom was happy not to have to guess over an immediate 4@s from Brink|pg||
nt|MolvaM: thomas bids what he hopes he can make|pg||
nt|MolvaM: reasonable bid but doesnt work today|pg||
nt|MolvaM: but maybe pushes opps to 4@h|pg||
nt|xenya: 2N promises 20+|pg||
nt|Walddk2: His suit might not be solid :)|pg||
nt|lechcold: i wygraj¹|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 6T aurait eu une chance de gagner si E avait cache ses coeurs, mais evidemment 2C est 100% normale|pg||
nt|marlowepi: a cartes ouvertes c'est faisable meme sans entame coeur, mais le dec fera les deux impasses perdantes|pg||
mb|p|nt|rigas_karo: 4@s in 5-1 fit in the oper room, probably +1|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: looks like an easy 3NT|pg||
nt|boyklas: its difficult to find the Jxx after this bidding, except if he lead it|pg||
nt|ady: should south double if they get to 6@S    might remove to 6NT|pg||
nt|psridhar: difficult to bid 5d on their own last bd- needed push from oppo|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: a part score 2@S by West|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so W missed to find 4/4 hearts fit|pg||
pc|sK|nt|wygbe1: yep it is|pg||
nt|Walddk12: Good morning to Paul Hackett|pg||
nt|wygbe1: and it was |pg||
nt|ady: problem is not there|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w were merciful but have missed the boat somewhat|pg||
nt|cameron_1: it is usally right to bid on know double fit hands|pg||
nt|tomi2:  but he should not bid 4nt too fast, because it could be keycard for spades, and partner would sell @SAK and no @CA as two aces|pg||
nt|andersk: 4@S is makeable, but <i do not understand why Charlie didnt look for @H suit first|pg||
nt|andersk: need to do something good in @s to make|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: hand 5 other room playing 4@S same contract|pg||
pc|s2|nt|tomi2:  not hackett should bid 5@H rather than double I think|pg||
nt|ady: sorry    blind spot    2 aces missing|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: can go -1 with a good defence timming|pg||
pc|sT|nt|rigas_karo: well this is an easy way :)|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Morning everyone|pg||
nt|peachy: Good morning Paul|pg||
nt|wygbe1: morning|pg||
nt|yuval10: very interesting sequence to work with your partner|pg||
nt|bagman: When a misunderstaning occurs, it's difficult to recover, because neither player knows what the misunderstanding has been|pg||
nt|athene: even if both players suspect, neither one can be sure his partner is in on the secret|pg||
nt|bagman: If N thinks that S has 1 ace and @S-void, he still cannot bid the grand|pg||
nt|athene: these sort of auctions are where top pairs really have to put in the time away from the table|pg||
nt|athene: because there are lots of imps riding on these hands|pg||
nt|lechcold: ogranicznie nie znoszê takich wejæ:)...|pg||

nt|justin c: 4@C...|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Gerben42: this contract will be no problem, will duck once to guard against 5-2 @C|pg||
nt|ziff:  2@Sx would have been 3 down at least on a @D lead or switch, but not easy to find, and 620 are available|pg||
nt|star6ija: 11 tricks|pg||
nt|antoniz: Adam zagra przez trefle z powodów komunikacyjnych|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Good evening to Peter Gill|pg||
pc|s3|nt|paulhac:  It is a playable game just but not with the trump break they did well to only go 1 off in the othere room|pg||
nt|lmeili: after 1@c 1@d what is 1N shows? some player holds 7 HCP as E they may not inv to game|pg||
nt|andersk: this will be -2 or more|pg||
nt|MolvaM: what about 5@c?|pg||
nt|udo: @D agreed now ?|pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: Czy wygra, to zobaczymy... W jasne karty ³atwo|pg||
pc|s4|nt|brolucius: 5@H, cue-bid denying a club control. Now 6@C will show first-round club control.|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|wygbe1: playing for 50 hearts, could set up spades and run them through south for down 1, losintg ak of spades and 2 hearts|pg||
nt|h_karluk: -3|pg||
nt|h_karluk: just play off top hearts|pg||
nt|andersk: I know - 3 double dummy, but they dont see all cards:)|pg||
nt|rodvenn: In practice 3@h is a good bid|pg||
nt|h_karluk: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_total_tricks|pg||
pc|cT|nt|Gerben42: sry always 2nd stopper|pg||
nt|eweber: just heard the second match of the Dutch was 11-19 vs Spain|pg||
nt|aldek: 4@S was close as well|pg||
nt|tomi2:  with 5@H he committses himself to 6 level even if partners @C were QJT, or does 4@S also show @C control?|pg||
nt|udo: hard now|pg||
pc|c2|nt|motu: depends on vul|pg||
nt|h_karluk: true|pg||
nt|yuval10: now only 2 down....can't be good for the leaders|pg||
nt|xenya: 12 tricks |pg||
nt|ftpe: yes|pg||
nt|ftpe: south should play club|pg||
nt|brolucius: Versace may think: 'I must have club ace to suggest a grand slam (with another spade cue-bid), so this is more accurate, showing @SK too.|pg||
nt|lesh: have to guess right|pg||
nt|petergill: Hi everyone|pg||
pc|c9|nt|ziff:  undo?|pg||

nt|h_karluk: @hQ for @s switch|pg||
nt|andersk: Do you good people understand the 5@C raise?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: if we are talking abt std signals|pg||
nt|andersk: I would probably try 3 NT|pg||
nt|h_karluk: by N?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: yes lots of game plus - but slam minus  hands|pg||
pc|hA|nt|eweber: results of round 2 are online by now |pg||
nt|eweber: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/10Ostend/asp/roundteams.asp?qtournid=820&qroundno=2|pg||
nt|eweber: England leading the group with 50(!)|pg||
nt|eweber: Russia 13th with 27|pg||
nt|eweber: NL 17th of 19 with 17|pg||
nt|othered1: But first south recues @S, guaranteeing some kind of @C control, I'd think|pg||
nt|udo: 5@S is ?|pg||
nt|brolucius: He would just bid 6@D with second-round club control.|pg||
nt|tomi2:  5@S = both black aces|pg||
nt|udo: i am told @S king and first round club|pg||
nt|brolucius: Well, he has already shown @SA, hasn't he? (With 4@S).|pg||
nt|tomi2:  probably with no @SK he'd bid 6@C|pg||
nt|brolucius: Indeed.|pg||
nt|udo: and 6@D with second round @C controll?|pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: Teraz to zmusili Go do zrobienia nadróbki...|pg||
mc|11|nt|mamos: England have done well on this board I feel|pg||
nt|othered1: And Lauria selects the highest scoring (and unbreakable, if partner has 1@D) spot.|pg||
pg||
qx|o7|st||md|1SJTHAK6DAKQT7CA76,SAK632HQ4D95CKQJ5,S98754H93DJ83C984,SQHJT8752D642CT32|sv|b|nt|lml: there is an argument for an immediate 4@S bid.|pg||
nt|othered1: 2N = 20-21, but south may upgrade|pg||
mb|2C|mb|d|nt|lml: either way North is not going to go anywhere|pg||
nt|othered1: and did.  Wonder what double meant|pg||
nt|lml: I usually play over double that pass say I want to defend if north has a balanced hand|pg||
nt|sastro: double showing @c probably|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: it could show most anything.  I have played CRASH with double as the C|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Guess there's not too much likelihood (but not zero) that they'll play 2@CXX.|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|othered1: will north bail or transfer to very unlucky @S?|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|lml: actually 2CX is probably there best spot|pg||

nt|bagman: He needs to guess 3 things: a) 5@D shows the 2nd suit, b) S has 2 aces, c) S has @S-void|pg||
nt|athene: well there's no way anyone is guessing all that|pg||
nt|athene: what they need is some way for north to agree hearts|pg||
nt|athene: then it's relatively easy|pg||
nt|athene: but slam auctions are hard when no-one knows what trumps are|pg||
nt|bagman: I'm sure they'll go back to the drawing board after this match|pg||
nt|santyclz: Perhaps 3@s over 2?  |pg||
nt|athene: it's sort of like trying to build the top story of a house of cards and then fill in the first layers later|pg||
nt|psridhar: of course it is genral precription -law can go wrong at times|pg||

nt|oleberg: Here. (I hope)|pg||
mb|2N|nt|lesh: a peaceful 4@h here, but lets see|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i guess slam @h|pg||
mb|p|nt|wygbe1: several roads to down one, as long as declarer assumes s has all the trumps|pg||
nt|yuval10: NS in the OR found the 6@d sac.|pg||
nt|roswolf: bd2 was flat when 4@S was also allowed to make|pg||
nt|fokal: on 6@h it seems clear to me that north couldn't make a move|pg||
nt|star6ija: operator, please try to follow the moves more precisely|pg||
nt|cameron_1: flat borad|pg||
nt|mamos: multi|pg||
nt|ftpe: ew migth go to 4 he here|pg||
nt|h_karluk: in practice very hard to reach, given layout diamonds favorably placed|pg||
nt|chick: Hamdi, the LoTT was originally devised by Vernes.  Cohen and Bergen popularized it, and Lawrence is the one who wrote "I fought the Law ..." disputing it's value :)|pg||
nt|pikolo: co ty bal na 8 inwituje |pg||
nt|kdr_fm: board 4 the austrian west did indeed bid 2@d Just like u suggest and another double swing|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: Spain had some yeterday againtx portugal at football :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: unless Sweden gifts some seems Austria's this team couldn't scratch something useful|pg||
nt|haans: standard bidding in 2nd hand no 2@H|pg||
nt|yuval10: so "only" 5 imps to Austria|pg||
nt|mamos: i think youd want to be in game|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 5c has much chances if declare can manage the 4-0 split|pg||
nt|tomi2:  7@D could be in danger of some ruff, not likely, but why take the risc...|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: 4H rolls now,, on lucky spade sit|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Although the K@S is right the K@D is wrong so 4@H is an excellent contract|pg||
nt|peachy: EW have a paying sacrifice, rare at Vul|pg||
nt|andersk: Might be possible to bid game here|pg||
nt|bagman: If North was confident that 4NT was RKCB in hearts, that was a good bid; no need to re-cue with 3@S|pg||
nt|fokal: but maybe S could (should ?) have bid something else than 6@h|pg||
nt|haans: the law is not the law just suggestions :)|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: another part score hand |pg||
nt|udo: guess after 3 NT Lauria gave him club A or King|pg||
nt|brolucius: If North has a club more and a diamond fewer, he would be delighted to hear of the @SK, which would give a second club discard.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: not guilty Maam :) i was living in an ocean away and the internet was not invented. i was just thirsty and eager to buy any foreign bridge book, thanks |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 2NT no move after |pg||
nt|oleberg: Boring partial|pg||
pc|cK|nt|motu: 1N is 9+  with 4cMajor possible as you can see|pg||
nt|ftpe: ahh, not any longer :)|pg||
nt|chick: 1N should warn S off from doing anything unilaterally and dramatic :)|pg||
nt|jkotor: na drugim zbieg³o 1nt|pg||
nt|oleberg: I wouldn't like to open the South hand 2nt. Partner might pass.|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 2NT= 8 tricks |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: think he will claim |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: straigh away|pg||
mc|8|nt|paulhac:  Isnt it 800?|pg||
nt|peachy: oops|pg||
nt|peachy: I think I need another cup of coffee!!!|pg||
nt|wygbe1: if n had just shown limit raise values for hearts, they would be in the easy 4h contract|pg||
nt|paulhac:  6@D is only on the K@D 50% almost|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Without a heart ruff|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 4 cards M 4th seat|pg||
nt|andersk: looks like NT has to be played by S, but 5@D makes|pg||
nt|h_karluk: quite gross dissortion|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT   for n/s looks normal|pg||
nt|athene: well, it was only good if he was confident and he knew his partner was confident it was, too :)|pg||
nt|athene: that is one strange double of 1@C|pg||
nt|bagman: In confusion, it's often a good idea to bid something, which can be passed )|pg||
nt|fokal: X from sementa seems artificial|pg||
nt|haans: why did S not bid 3@H|pg||
nt|xenya: my assignment was for Closed Room|pg||
nt|lechcold: 4333? no nie wiem...kiedy co prawda Adam otwiera³ 1BA do 18:)|pg||

nt|othered1: I like 2@S if within range.  Very descriptive|pg||
nt|othered1: Are there typical multi methods to handle the south hand intelligently?|pg||
nt|lml: you can start with a query based on your methods|pg||
nt|lml: 2NT possibly|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|sastro: Blakset has to decide between a 2 @s and 2 nt bid|pg||

nt|lml: yep|pg||

nt|collins64: if it is NF|pg||
nt|paulhac:  England takes the lead for the first time.|pg||
nt|andersk: unlucky board for the Austrians|pg||

nt|roswolf: overtrick imps to ireland|pg||

nt|andreasw:  neeeverrr:)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 3@c shows what?|pg||
nt|shevek: no, not from here !|pg||
nt|MolvaM: both minors?|pg||
nt|shevek: 3@c = 5-5 in the minors|pg||
nt|andreasw:  it should|pg||
nt|hawe45:  E/O ou N/S?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|collins64: another 2@c opening in North|pg||
nt|athene: will south double 2@H or bid 2@S?|pg||
mb|p|nt|andersk: Italy running good in Bridge, but currently out of the world cup|pg||
nt|star6ija: 3N is possible here|pg||
nt|aldek: I'd say west should bid on the base of the quality of the spades, an ace and a singleton|pg||
nt|cameron_1: i agree|pg||

mb|3N|nt|collins64: both majors at least 44|pg||
nt|boyklas: i think he judged that the hand shouldnt be to game with the singleton S and the KH wasted value after showing C+S|pg||
nt|bagman: If partner has Txx left, both the 9 and the Q work; what about other holdings?|pg||
nt|ftpe: boring cards again|pg||
nt|justin c: expect south will drive to slam now|pg||
mb|p|nt|star6ija: stubborn @s stopper|pg||

nt|andreasw:  no best slam with @d AK out:)|pg||
nt|shevek: but 5@d is not a make|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 5d seems ok since defence cannot take their club ruff with a small trump|pg||
nt|rodvenn: Very good bridge to reach 5 @d in both rooms. |pg||
nt|james_h: 2@d XX being played at the other table|pg||
nt|james_h: NS|pg||
nt|eamongall: The Great Mulall managed 2@DXX a few months ago in the Regent up 3 ... Michael is not having the same success |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: another missfit in @S for N-S|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: shooting to 3NT |pg||
pc|h5|nt|xenya: or the score is wrong -- that happens from time to time|pg||
nt|lesh: but over 2@h West might blast to a game|pg||
nt|oleberg: The natural @D lead, will give the 9.th trick immidiately|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 3NT with a missfit is alays veryvery dificult |pg||

nt|jameslee 2: 1 of the thing we try to teach bridge students is to go to game to 3NT with a fit in a minor |pg||

nt|jameslee 2: quite  a few down -3/-4 could be the result|pg||

nt|star6ija: happens... :)|pg||
nt|shevek: yes|pg||
nt|haans: easier to play 2@D doubles not game sore if make|pg||

pc|d4|nt|eweber: in board 4 NL managed to win 4 by making 2@d, so 5:4 for them now|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Lebensohl or transfer Lebensohl. Transfer Lebensohl would show both monors|pg||
nt|peachy: even down 1, this be small gain for England|pg||

nt|lesh: he didnt has the entry ,however the small spade gave it|pg||
nt|h_karluk: then ruff hearts and try devil's coup|pg||
nt|petergill: At least 8 tricks for NS, even on a trump switch|pg||
nt|oleberg: Like Zia says: When you have the @D9, PLAY IT|pg||
pc|h6|nt|athene: the auction in the other room looks like an interesting twist on leaping michaels - you bid 4 of the minor you haven't got|pg||
nt|athene: that is perhaps sensible if you play the bids as forcing|pg||
nt|bagman: Thx all. I need to go now, see you again.|pg||
nt|bagman: bye|pg||
nt|santyclz: Thanks Pekka.|pg||

nt|jameslee 2: 9@D   a not bad play he will make 9 tricks |pg||
nt|oleberg: Yes, the defence has to play something|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|athene: it looks at first as though declarer might be able to hold his losers to two trumps from here, if he guesses right, but there's just too much work to do, i suppose|pg||
nt|lesh: well the declarer didnt want to take advantage|pg||
nt|chick: hehe|pg||
pc|d5|nt|star6ija: 12 tricks may be taken now|pg||
nt|haans: @S7 count even|pg||
pc|dA|nt|paulhac:  This looks like the only lead to give the contract|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Thanks Paul|pg||

nt|xenya: 9 tricks now on a cross ruff|pg||
nt|chick: so a grosvenor duck by N sets this :)|pg||
nt|petergill: My job was to photograph the Swedish girls for the Bulletin after their win in Piestany. Cecilia said "Please wait until I make myself look better." I thought that was impossible. ...|pg||
nt|petergill: I will see if I can show find the photo for you|pg||
pc|c9|nt|athene: spade force looked the natural play - perhaps Duboin was worried about forcing declarer too much and helping him into a trump coup against north's known heart length|pg||
nt|haans: Fallenius do not like it :(|pg||
nt|psridhar: Fredin must be ruing his decision to upgrade his hand to 1NT opening|pg||

mb|2S|nt|othered1: Mine, too|pg||
nt|Walddk8: Not sure why the website has a 9-8 scoreline|pg||
mb|d|nt|henryb:  the problem with 2@h as a constructive raise is that you have too much in reserve|pg||
mb|2N|nt|othered1: This is the identical auction to the CR's before the second double|pg||
nt|othered1: I wonder what redouble by west would  have meant here?  To me, extras with defense.|pg||
nt|othered1: Instead of 2N|pg||
nt|Walddk8: The website has the scores the players enter at the table, so either a player entered the wrong score on a board or one of our operator misclaimed|pg||
nt|henryb:  I'm with you|pg||
nt|henryb:  On the running score can you see where the imps are?|pg||
nt|sastro: That Johnson does not redouble proves that they obviously open very weak in 3rd position|pg||
nt|othered1: But this is vul against not and was second seat|pg||
nt|Walddk8: Yes, looks like Iceland gained 7 IMPs on board 4|pg||
nt|sastro: freely spoken I cannot understand the 2nd Double|pg||
nt|Walddk8: 420  110|pg||

nt|ziff:  I am not surprised....|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: I see that on the rama but no idea on the subject|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: maybe on the slow playing|pg||
nt|tomi2:  yeaterday Nerherlands - Russia was scored as 18-2 VP because of 5 VP for each team|pg||
nt|lmeili: because of slow play?|pg||
nt|tomi2:  yes, as far as I know|pg||
nt|lmeili: that was a heavy penalty!|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: If I have good information they finish 20 minutes late in that match|pg||
nt|tomi2:  10 VP for 20 minutes? thats a lot|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: restarting here|pg||
nt|athene: which means duboin can't have had a count on the diamonds - if he knew declarer had four he would have bashed out that @S10 like a shot|pg||
nt|athene: the standard counter to a 2-suiter being to force declarer|pg||
nt|andreasw:  then a @d to ace and a @s back |pg||

nt|psridhar: might hv worked on some other layout |pg||

nt|h_karluk: 5@c/@d ok|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: the @D was abit of desperation ... if left to her (i'm told) own devices declarer will have to gess is it @dKxx or @dKx|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: israel made 3nt on bd 4 for another game swing|pg||
nt|ady: partial here in spades   Ireland need to keep low|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes may well get too high|pg||
nt|psridhar: Fredin will briefly consider 3nt b4 bidding 4s when he finds out his pd has unbal hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: There was no follow-up to discuss. North jumped to 3@D, South thought it was a WJS and passed|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Gerben42: apparently the rooms are connected now|pg||
nt|Gerben42: white vs red NS are very agressive, but as we have seen vuln. they are middle of the road|pg||
nt|eweber: 3@s is not exactly what you'd dream of with the South hand...|pg||
nt|Gerben42: best to not dream but pass with a happy face|pg||
nt|eweber: I assume West is the one who is taking his time here|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Great to see the Irish at the top of the leader board|pg||
nt|josj: as far as I know, they were about 30 mins. late and were eventually fined 3 VP each|pg||

nt|shevek: south can only get in once (@dK)|pg||
nt|ftpe: that opening will probably bring them to 6 spades|pg||
nt|xenya: on 7, the Estonian EW in the other room got to 4@H -- not a bad contract really, but down on foul trump split -- 1 down and 7 imps to Russia|pg||
nt|ftpe: in 6 spades he has to guess spade queen, but best chance is playing on sp 2-2|pg||
nt|haans: 10-13|pg||
nt|lechcold: 54 impy w 8 rozdaniach|pg||
mb|d|nt|mcarroll: Unfortunate lie of the cards, but will be the same in the other room  one assumes|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hmmm?|pg||

nt|santyclz: Hand reversed?|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: ty vugragher |pg||
nt|oleberg: Well, if you play Ghana in football, I guess a black squeeze is possible|pg||
mb|2H|nt|boyklas: FG raise with D?|pg||
nt|boyklas: or 14+ Bal?|pg||
nt|haans: that 1@S overcall???|pg||
nt|xenya: i don't think 6@S is such a great contract -- problems in spades and diamonds|pg||
nt|ftpe: agree, but they will get there after ligth open, |pg||
nt|xenya: well the 3@H bid makes it easier to solve the spade problem|pg||

mb|p|nt|rigas_karo: it is safe to bid once again but |pg||

nt|h_karluk: i choose 3@h cue here|pg||

nt|lechcold: basketball|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: ahh true|pg||
mb|p|nt|collins64: if Mike bid 4@d, Isabelle 4@h they'll play 6@d|pg||
nt|eweber: if anyone of the players|pg||
nt|yuval10: not everyone's X perhaps|pg||
nt|ady: this might cause Irland to get too high|pg||
nt|jkotor: jak w dobrych juniorskich czasach :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|rigas_karo: 4@d or 4NT?|pg||
nt|roswolf: the boards have been swingy - Italy - slovakia 46-0 after 4 boards shows how|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Vul, not for the fainthearted!|pg||
nt|mamos: at least a couple off|pg||
nt|cameron_1: but flat vs. 3@s so|pg||
nt|cameron_1: flatish|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes but N takes the firsst @D trick|pg||
nt|MolvaM: good stop|pg||
nt|andreasw:  first|pg||
nt|xenya: no slam now -- just collecting your money i think...|pg||
nt|lechcold: 2BA naci¹gane|pg||
nt|james_h: Penos in South Africa ...|pg||
nt|oleberg: 2@H = 3 spades and a good raise. Normally not a gameforcing hand|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|andersk: opps|pg||
nt|andersk: cold 4 @H|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 4@H +1|pg||
nt|athene: not sure i like unusual 2nt with 6@D4@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: :)|pg||
nt|athene: partner usually bids clubs with equal length which isn't at all what you want|pg||
nt|athene: notice how south can't bid stayman intending 2@S (sign-off) over 2@D|pg||
nt|athene: they obviously play that as something cunning|pg||
nt|athene: we have seen they have lots of relay auctions after stayman so you do lose the ability to bid it on rubbish hands|pg||
nt|shevek: 8 declarer made 3N and 8 went down|pg||
nt|shevek: declarers|pg||
nt|MolvaM: so it must have been a 50% contract :)|pg||
nt|shevek: true, needs accurate defence|pg||
nt|shevek: lol  murat|pg||
nt|xenya: or... who knows?|pg||
nt|lesh: he has to guess Q@d now, but it is difficult and probably -2|pg||
nt|hawe45:  300 avec le bon flanc - mais tout normale|pg||
nt|mdgraham: understandable auction, but the cards do not lie well|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: Ole I would love to play Ghana tat would mean we are in the final :)|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 2@H = is new for me nice |pg||
nt|oleberg: "To play Ghana" sounds like something that could be illegal (or prohibited to minors)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|pitiful:  some play middle encourages and high or low sp in this situation|pg||
nt|shevek: to be fair some went down in 6@d :)|pg||
nt|petergill: Found it http://www.worldbridge1.org/bulletin/06_2%20Piestany/pdf/pairs/bul_04.pdf there are 2 photos of Cecilia. Interesting that the Poles who ran 2nd to them in the 2006 World ...|pg||

pc|d2|nt|collins64: he made the wrong choice|pg||

nt|boyklas: and he make go down even a 5D|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: at least the did well to avoid 6NT :)|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: 5@d by North is safe|pg||
nt|collins64: Belgium is back after the previous deal|pg||
nt|collins64: Dehaye weak NT forced them to play 4@h for one down|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: very weak NT :)|pg||
nt|boyklas: Manolis choosed to play at the 5-3 fit and not at the 4-4, firstly was thinking that he is playing at th 5-4 fit|pg||
nt|collins64: the bidding was 1NT 8-11 Pass 3@c X and he bid 4@h with his 5-card Q@h and his 4-card 8@s|pg||
nt|ady: they might make this  getting 3 diamond tricks|pg||
nt|lesh: A@s and @d switch|pg||
nt|h_karluk: straightforward play also possible|pg||
nt|chick: against the odds to drop the @DQ, but W may lead trump now to protect against a spade ruff|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|dburn: perhaps he should have signalled for a heart|pg||
nt|aldek: and now @DQ|pg||
pc|s2|nt|collins64: did he actually play the K@h|pg||

nt|rnmalik: suit worth bidding is worth leading.:)|pg||
nt|haans: most would say "thats not fair"|pg||
nt|davidb: should make on the  D suit |pg||
nt|athene: if north has a pretty good penalty pass here unless he thinks the double is really really offensive|pg||
nt|santyclz: The "DNPA" (does not promise anything) stayman has a lot going for it, but gives up a lot on big hands.|pg||

nt|h_karluk: if ther declarer decided to play straightforward that doesn't make a sense|pg||

nt|brolucius: Speculative double from East.|pg||
nt|othered1: Their doubles show extras, I believe.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They prefer to use double for something else. One can survive without support doubles you know|pg||
nt|tomi2:  eas has @CAQ in their opened suit, @DA, @SQ and partner made a constructive call vulnerable|pg||
nt|brolucius: Kibitzers suggest lead-directing double (similar to Lightner). But not obvious to me, nor to West.|pg||

nt|brolucius: One heart loser goes on the @CA, so slam depends on picking up the trump. But no reason to think they will bid it.|pg||
nt|snetram:  trefl do waleta i 9 lew|pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: Oraz Nefki...|pg||
nt|james_h: I;m Herr James H from Austria, check my flag |pg||
pc|d3|nt|paulhac:  With the clubs 3-3 there is no obvious defence|pg||
nt|h_karluk: have no idea why did not touch spades before diamonds|pg||
nt|andersk: SVK- ITA 2-1|pg||
nt|andersk: 10 min left|pg||
nt|haans: i think he did not have a clue were @SJ was :)|pg||
nt|athene: but more likely it's just a shaded opener|pg||
nt|othered1: EW's card mentions "distributional asking relays," which may be in effect here.|pg||
nt|8252: oui, mais c'est les même levées à SA|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: board 10 North by not openning lost a @S = part score contract|pg||
pc|d7|nt|boyklas: he may play well the S, if he play small to the A and see the KS drops he can play small to T now the JXX cant be played|pg||
nt|andreasw:  me to|pg||
nt|lesh: well I supposed a pass by South but when he opened N/S ended in 1nt :)|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ady: claim soon|pg||
nt|star6ija: trump lead is the best for EW|pg||
nt|lesh: so they were first to bid it:)|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|star6ija: well done|pg||
nt|justin c: lol|pg||
pc|dT|nt|Gerben42: making many tricks|pg||
nt|shevek: at least!  :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: You might not get a heart lead.|pg||
nt|othered1: and east's cheapest bid style h ere surely looks like a relay auction.  Don't have translation,  however.|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 4@C= 10 tricks |pg||
pc|d8|nt|pitiful:  still if he did he would probably be on lead to 4@s anyway|pg||
nt|pitiful:  Gold would open Rolands favourite flannery|pg||
nt|mamos: yes there are two "f" words we mustnt mention this week|pg||
nt|pitiful:  I am rather depressed by the scoreline, hopefully our dutch friends will start doing something wrong soon|pg||
nt|haans: 9-11 as first passed|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|andreasw:  lol|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|boyklas: he made it|pg||
nt|eamongall: I remember terraneo also in some large book about championship bridge |pg||
nt|james_h: Lets not lose hope, see if we can keep it to 5-25 or better|pg||
nt|oleberg: South might have opened too, on board 10|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: @H brake 3/3 will help him to get home|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @sA onside and @h not worse than 4-2 is enough|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: true clubs 2/2 helps but with clubs 3/1 also gets there with a @H play first|pg||
pc|sA|nt|tomi2:  I guess west showed 4 3 2 4 :)|pg||
nt|chick: W could have overcalled 1N and been first :)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|rigas_karo: belguim picked up another 8 imps in board 10|pg||
nt|collins64: no|pg||
nt|boyklas: why no?|pg||
nt|mamos: Gold doesnt have many clues as to the outstanding values|pg||
nt|brolucius: And other chances when someone holds @SQ-x-x. Yes, it is a good slam.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: new strawberried peanut butter M&M time |pg||
pc|s2|nt|collins64: why A@c|pg||

nt|snetram:  dwa pÅaskie rozdania na uspokojenie gry|pg||
nt|8252: je connais quelques flambeurs qui crééraient l'écart en jouant un honneur sec derrière|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: looks like this will just get home declarer heart pips are just too good and S cant force E|pg||
pc|sT|nt|hawe45:  Carefully played to discard a @H|pg||
nt|cameron_1: are you sure?|pg||
nt|mamos: South holding @HK makes it morelikely that North has @sK   but still needs to finesse 10|pg||
nt|othered1: But NS will  have an exact description of west hand and west will be declarer so @H lead very likely from both sides.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Well done to bid it!|pg||
nt|tomi2:  lauria will lead @HK with his likely trump trick|pg||
pc|sK|nt|pitiful:  that was just to see how many messages I would get :)|pg||
nt|pitiful:  quite a few|pg||
nt|pitiful:  ...|pg||
nt|mamos: i think you should stick to Bridge Peter|pg||
nt|pitiful:  and no I do not play for Spurs|pg||
nt|pitiful:  perhaps I need to put that in my profile|pg||
nt|dburn: his problem is that he thinks (from the opening bid) that North has the ace of clubs|pg||
nt|pitiful:  this is very tough for TT|pg||
nt|pitiful:  DG sorry|pg||
nt|dburn: in which case he needs to cater for the possibility that North will play the fourth round of diamonds|pg||
nt|dburn: so perhaps he will cash hearts, hoping to pitch West's remaining diamond|pg||
nt|dburn: of course, if he had played a low heart to the queen instead of running the jack, as he probably should have done, he would have a quick entry to dummy now|pg||
nt|ftpe: yes|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|petergill: EW are topping the datums after 15 rounds http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/10Ostend/Results.htm|pg||

nt|mcarroll: Trump continuing the good work|pg||
nt|MolvaM: next question. do you agree with 4nt?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: with 4-4=|pg||
nt|andreasw:  i would pass|pg||
nt|shevek: as I said, I would pass in all positions  lol|pg||
nt|andreasw:  :)|pg||
nt|tomi2:  @C lead would be fatal, but I can't imagine this|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so Jivko, just curiosity, you didn't consider 1N overcall by W?|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: Ice|pg||
nt|oleberg: South undeled his diamonds in case declarer had the @SJ|pg||
nt|oleberg: Then a low spade would have given declarer a guess|pg||
pc|c3|nt|jameslee 2: 8 more for Israel so score 11/2|pg||
nt|psridhar: that dia 3 by Fredin in the 3rd round of dia=sps for h ( 2 for cl and 4 for spd)- obediently Fallenius shifts to H for d2 wd|pg||
nt|tomi2:  west will take his time to think of the best play in trumps|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, double dummy he can make it, but the players don't have the hand records|pg||
pc|c6|nt|haans: now he must try spades|pg||
nt|eamongall: I am informed fucik and terraneo are only in mid 50s age |pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c4|pg||
pc|hA|nt|hawe45:  Claim|pg||
nt|dburn: but he would doubtless have used that to play for North to hold @sKx rather than @sK10x|pg||
nt|lesh: it depends on their methods and the decision of the player. 1NT could be 5@c and 4M, or as here he prefered DBL instead of overcalling 1nt as 15-17|pg||
pc|h2|nt|shevek: flat hand, give it a go, sure pass|pg||
nt|h_karluk: oh that makes sense, thanks|pg||
nt|lesh: I dont know how E/W play 1nt overcall|pg||
pc|h4|nt|rnmalik: 10 tricks. No damage done.|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|rnmalik: sorry-11.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: There is no sane player who would insert the 10|pg||
nt|othered1: now west has to  hope that north also holds 4+@D to pitch both @H|pg||
nt|tomi2:  he will try for singleton king of clubs with south maybe ?;)|pg||
nt|brolucius: God is Italian in this room. But he will not be Italian in the other room, if they reach the good slam too.|pg||
nt|tomi2:  god was a German yesterday, that is quite fair :)|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: after X = N the would have been 11 tricks |pg||
pc|h7|pc|h6|nt|star6ija: but seems declarer will prevail anyway|pg||
nt|pitiful:  crikey @s 10|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well, if they disallow legitimate goals, it's not easy to win football matches|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h8|pg||
nt|h_karluk: no rush, rectrified the count|pg||
nt|mamos: crikey @SA|pg||

nt|antoniz: +1|pg||

nt|andreasw:  poland reach slam here just not 6@h but 6@d:)|pg||
mb|d|nt|rnmalik: 3NT for Ns.|pg||
nt|tomi2:  in the OR Piekared prefered a double here to 2NT|pg||
nt|tomi2:  ending up as dummy in 2@D, not the contract he was dreaming of|pg||
nt|athene: i am not sure where they went wrong but clearly a wheel came off somewhere|pg||
nt|pitiful:  another lead directing bid|pg||
nt|dburn: I suspect the play went quickly at the end - some of those cards were doubltess not played to the same trick|pg||
nt|shevek: I just had a glimpse at the poles playing in 6@d|pg||
nt|shevek: you too :)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  :)|pg||
nt|lesh: I wonder what 1NT is|pg||
nt|chick: 3 suit takeout?|pg||
nt|lesh: I suppose N/S will land at least at 5th level, but then E/W might bid 6@c and then ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: say didn't begin w art 1@c, 3 aces outside, so that's DD slam of EW players, what a homework, ty teacher!|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 11 cards @S for N-S|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: direct 4@S|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: by S|pg||
mb|4S|nt|Gerben42: EW possibly in trouble now|pg||
nt|xenya: perhaps W was concerned about bad splits in the balck suits and 4-1 @Hs, but all was well|pg||
nt|8252: mais il vaut mieux soit qua ça marche, soit avoir des partenaires compréhensifs et doux|pg||
mb|5C|nt|andersk: Est overcalled 1 @S in open room, and South 2 @S, quite strange bidding, anyway NOrway playing 5 NT in open room|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Looks like 4@H should make|pg||
nt|tomi2:  Wladow knows about partnes @C qualitiy, so he won't lead a club now ;)|pg||
nt|mamos: Gold keeps his 1@D openers up to strength :)|pg||
mb|d|nt|ady: 5@C looks difficult with a trump trick and A@S off  and diamonds bottled up|pg||
nt|justin c: did East bid this?|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: unlikely undo ?|pg||
nt|eamongall: I don't think she meant to be rescued |pg||
nt|james_h: this might get interesting but I doubt it|pg||
nt|eamongall: ah yeah pass 1@S |pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 11: At the other table, South opened 1NT, West bid 2@C single suiter  and EW never found out what suit it was, so NS ended up in 4@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|andersk: 2-2|pg||
nt|andersk: no|pg||
nt|andersk: offside|pg||
nt|andersk: incredible match on TV too:)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 6@d may have communication problems.... between parters :)|pg||
nt|lesh: probably 1nt was 3 suits and that's why North decided to pass over 3@d|pg||
nt|lesh: and possible 5@c bid by West now if 1nt is what we suppose to mean|pg||
nt|petergill: something to be said for: calling a spade a spade, perhaps|pg||
nt|ralfwil: close to 6nt|pg||
nt|mdgraham: or even Two Spades|pg||
nt|petergill: yes|pg||
nt|petergill: Susan Stockdale knows that her @DK should be huge, being in partner's suit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: raise to 4NT?|pg||
nt|petergill: I think she will bid 4NT quantitative|pg||
nt|ralfwil: perhaps 4nt from W|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: nice fight by W = 5@C |pg||
nt|oleberg: 5@C is a nice save, -300|pg||
mb|p|nt|lesh: but still it will be very agressive |pg||
mb|p|nt|eweber: but still, with 210 and 170 on my score card I wouldn't feel to good, it may not cost but surely won't bring in...|pg||
nt|andersk: even more exsiteing then bbo|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT hopless if they lead hearts   |pg||
nt|andreasw:  lol|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: dangerous reopenning here |pg||
nt|psridhar: thin 4s for EW , a lucky make -but imposs to get there unless pushed|pg||
nt|haans: but most of us would|pg||
nt|psridhar: South does have a good hand, cant fault him for reopening|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: what will North try to bid ?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think a similar example was in one of Ian Fleming's 007 JB books|pg||
nt|h_karluk: trappy sample|pg||
nt|lesh: I dont think North will pass|pg||
nt|lesh: South has showed 0-5 and 6+ spades but ...|pg||
nt|chick: N's hand is far too good|pg||
nt|chick: almost slam in hand|pg||
nt|lesh: 4@h is making|pg||
nt|chick: only problem is ... can he overcome his fear of 4-1 or 4-2 trump split in a red suit|pg||
nt|petergill: and then Fiona will probably pass, wanting one more diamond or one more highish card anywhere for 6NT|pg||
nt|ralfwil: With these two guys, you must be fast on the keyboard|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 4@S=620|pg||
nt|oleberg: If he gets diamonds right, which he will.|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 5@C=300 or 500|pg||
pc|cK|nt|paulhac:  Putting South to the test|pg||
nt|star6ija: 2@d game forcing|pg||
nt|tomi2:  he is mathematican and we often see him going for overtricks in games where he can go down, when he thinks odds are better than 95%|pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: Pani Agato! |pg||
nt|petergill: Fiona will like @D10, bulking up her long suit|pg||
pc|c5|nt|rigas_karo: maybe he thought declarer hand 6421|pg||
nt|andersk: same lead as open room, probably 11 and a push|pg||
nt|Gerben42: you never know yesterday I saw Greco Hampson making 3N on 11 vs 10|pg||
nt|peachy: somebody took a long time, I assume|pg||
nt|roswolf: looks very possible|pg||
nt|shevek: they had some intervention by west who showed the blacks, still....|pg||
nt|dburn: quite a lot may depend on the lead to 6NT - @c10 (or@c9 depending on methods) will not work well|pg||
nt|dburn: but this is dangerous|pg||
nt|petergill: Ralf, or you will be burned ... am I still allowed to commentate after that?  |pg||
nt|ralfwil: :)|pg||
nt|petergill: 6@C, in case West has 5 clubs|pg||
nt|dburn: although West probably ought to convert to 6NT...|pg||
nt|petergill: A conversion to 6NT would avoid the nasty 5-1 split|pg||
nt|petergill: With 4 clubs, East might have proceeded via "fourth suit forcing"|pg||
pc|c2|nt|rnmalik: This board.|pg||
nt|peachy: and cant be but South|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes|pg||
nt|8252: il va falloir du bon timing ici|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|star6ija: 2N no 3@ss|pg||
nt|psridhar: note that S does not have values like unsupported king or queen sitting under the NT opener-he has a 'pure' hand|pg||
nt|chick: now a XX|pg||
nt|lesh: dangerous call|pg||
nt|chick: "pick another suit"|pg||
nt|lesh: he can even make 5@d|pg||
nt|lesh: 4@h and 5@d making but 3nt not |pg||
nt|chick: he can make 6H if he plays E for something like 4414 or 4405 ... losing 1 heart and no diamonds ... or am I missing something?|pg||
nt|james_h: I like Derek O'Gs raise|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: nice bid West|pg||

nt|boyklas: its possible|pg||
nt|ady: kib asking again for link to running scores please|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm not the expected lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/runningscores/asp/roundteamsconditstatclassicmod.asp?qtournid=817&qshowflag=1|pg||
nt|pitiful:  well this is not very interesting|pg||
nt|pitiful:  @c lead best|pg||
nt|lesh: opps 3nt also makes:) He has the entry for @d finess|pg||
nt|lesh: he can but it is impossible to bid|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i whispered he could pass to 3NX but seems was busy a lot and did not hear me|pg||
nt|chick: entry for @D finesse is a problem|pg||
nt|chick: and 6@C EW is makeable too, I think|pg||
nt|lesh: slams are makeable but it is diffucult to reach. |pg||
nt|chick: I dunno, I'd still keep trying to reach a red slam with N's hand|pg||
nt|lesh: from the bidding you know what 4@h are 4-1 at least and there is 4th @d in West|pg||
nt|chick: yes, that's what is scaring N into serious caution|pg||
nt|lesh: your partner is 0-5 points with 6+ spades|pg||
nt|lesh: you dont expect him have K@hxx and 109x in @d|pg||
nt|chick: and nothing wasted in @Ss :)|pg||
nt|aldek: ale konsekwentne|pg||
pc|c4|nt|star6ija: still some communication problems|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: problems are arriving for N-S |pg||
nt|psridhar: but 3C x is painful all the same|pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: Przepraszam...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, that's avoided the 5-1 trump break |pg||
nt|dburn: good decision - now all East has to do is make it|pg||
nt|petergill: Good decision by Susan, but can 6NT be made?|pg||
nt|Walddk7: It can|pg||
nt|dburn: North will probably be squeezed in the majors even if East does not pick the clubs|pg||
nt|dburn: but on this auction South is not all that likely to lead the suit|pg||
nt|ralfwil: N is squeezed in majors|pg||
nt|Walddk7: She can get four club tricks by force|pg||
nt|petergill: South has to lead - what? - something ... the hearts and spades lie over West's holdings, reducing squeeze possibilities|pg||
nt|ralfwil: A squeese in more fun than a double finess:)|pg||
nt|Walddk7: If she is inspired and trust that @CJ is a singleton she has four tricks in the suit. The rest will come from diamonds|pg||
nt|petergill: East's 3rd heart might be a vital threat in this hand which even Fiona, usually a fast but careful player, will take a long time to play, surely|pg||
nt|Walddk7: She has just enough entries for all that|pg||
nt|dburn: but if South chooses the queen of hearts (which is dangerous), East may well go astray|pg||
nt|petergill: Sandra Rimstedt can hardly lead a club after this bidding, or will she?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: @HQ is a bit of a Flash Harry sort of lead|pg||
nt|ralfwil: When E can see a 5-card @c and a 4-card @d the squeeze is easy|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: always remember to make actions depending on the vul position |pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|collins64: no Mike show count on J@d lead 7 cards so not possible |pg||
nt|MolvaM: to protect the @cQ and against bad breaks,|pg||
nt|justin c: looks like 5 losers here|pg||
nt|petergill: A low club lead is safe into the expected 4-3 fit - either partner has a bare @C honour or she does not|pg||
nt|Walddk7: That will likely give the show away|pg||
nt|dburn: well, that's a safe club to lead - declarer probably won't take four club tricks now|pg||
nt|petergill: NS lead 3rd and 5th versus both NT and suit|pg||
nt|Walddk7: I think she will, they lead 5th|pg||
nt|Walddk7: That's what I meant by giving the show away|pg||
nt|dburn: yes, but they also lead third - it would be a little vexing to lose to @cJ109 or the like with North|pg||
nt|petergill: A club lead from a 3 or 4 card holding is unlikely (being risky, might pick up partner's queen) on the bidding|pg||
nt|dburn: well, declarer lost her way at the other table, so this is a big chance for Fiona Brown|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: here is ths most advantaje Vulnerable position for a pair Non Vul - Vul = we are clear advantaje never hesitate to fight 1 more |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: remember te only bad safe is when you are getting paid 1 don and you decided to defend |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 1 down |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: as you can see West has no key cards to fight againtx 4@S|pg||
mc|9|nt|ady: got of to a bad lead    but still defence can recover  South will need to play a low heart when in with A@S   and north will have to read the position|pg||
nt|star6ija: decided by the defense|pg||
nt|andreasw:  Magnusson in control here and chose 6@h|pg||
nt|tomi2:  if he exited with a heart, Versace could have won the Jack and give partner a @D ruff to "get back" the 2 imps Kirmse was working for, but we don't know the cards exactly|pg||

nt|henryb:  another strong result for Iceland in the other room|pg||
nt|othered1: North made quite a double in the CR.  Not exactly sure what motivated it, but it surely was effective.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|othered1: I guess west showed long @D . . . |pg||

nt|eweber: no blood|pg||
nt|vasmar: 4@hearts by E-W will be probably the contract here|pg||

nt|hawe45:  Easy money|pg||
nt|santyclz: Pearson is rolling...|pg||
nt|hawe45:  2 passed boards out of 12|pg||
nt|xenya: brb|pg||

nt|psridhar: Fallenius needed to retain that dia for 1100|pg||
nt|h_karluk: neat decision for EW|pg||
nt|chick: it's so annoying to have a hand like N's and not get to play the contract :)|pg||

nt|andersk: amercan|pg||
nt|andreasw:  4@c wins|pg||
nt|MolvaM: the slam brought 13 to iceland|pg||
nt|MolvaM: open room stopped in 3nt|pg||
nt|shevek: Wales didn't bid the slam|pg||
nt|marlowepi: entre temps, pour rep[ondre a ceux qui disent que 6SA est un meilleur contrat, ce n;est point evident. il y a des possibilities d'un coup de recoucissement a trefles  dans le cas ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: de certaines mauvaises repartitions des atuts, qui nettement n'existeraient pas a 6SA|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: multi and jump to 4@h other table probably|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: used 2nt ... |pg||

mb|p|nt|Gerben42: 5 imps for NL I predict|pg||
nt|haans: ty|pg||
mb|2C|nt|ady: last hand with the diamonds well hand South might have ducked the first spade  and if spades continued  north night have played the 10 on the 2nd round as a suit preference signal|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 2s shows?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: a normal weak 2?|pg||
nt|andreasw:  in my book it would be to strong for a weak bid|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, the boards in this set haven't been overly exciting so far|pg||
nt|ftpe: 2 diamond multi i guess, hard with only 5-carder and minimum|pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: Jansma próbuje: 4BA|pg||
nt|petergill: Susan has become a perfect partner, who will not say a word|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: On the other hand, that was an awfully quacky hand, even with 15 "Pearson Points" (hcp + number of @ss.)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: a knowledgeable spec tells me: maybe invitational (or almost) with spades|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: other room playing in hand nº 12 just 2@S  (no reopening call ther by South ) |pg||
nt|psridhar: 800 just may not be a disaster if only the Israelis stumble into 4s making|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: so swing coming for sweden|pg||
mb|2H|nt|vasmar: 2 diamonds and one heart for a routine 620|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, I just played through their defence on 10 (using the MOVIE feature).|pg||
nt|petergill: Susan Stockdale told me in Japan in February that once upon a time (long ago), she wasn't such a perfect partner|pg||

nt|h_karluk: another DD slam there|pg||
nt|lesh: 1@c 16+ , 1@d 0-7, 2nt is 22-23|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: Hand 13 and a clear win for Denmark 15/1 Iceland for te moment |pg||
mb|p|nt|me argent: sagesse?|pg||
nt|me argent: les francais etaient tres chanceux|pg||
nt|marlowepi: j'hesite d'utiliser le mot "sagesse" quand on empaille n chelem a quelques 75%. quoique legerment partisan, je choisirais le mot "chance"|pg||
nt|marlowepi: merci Joey, et sois le bienvenu|pg||
mb|3N|nt|paulhac:  Possible swing here as 4@S should make but not guaranteed|pg||
nt|roswolf: good point david|pg||
nt|MolvaM: or barely invitational  :)|pg||
nt|shevek: looks like some weakish non-fit bid|pg||
nt|xenya: 3rd seat... -- still a bit too aggressive to my taste|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 5@D -1 |pg||
nt|psridhar: gr8 contract -the Herbsts hit back !|pg||
nt|haans: 5@D was a bit to much|pg||
nt|psridhar: sry is 5d down 1?|pg||
nt|psridhar: yes 2 aces and a spd for d1|pg||
nt|haans: 2 aces and a spade|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: there we are 18/12 for Sweden a string come back after they went down 2/11 |pg||
nt|haans: only reason i can find is try to get board 12 back|pg||

mb|p|nt|Gerben42: this looks at least -1|pg||
nt|Walddk7: 1@H any 20+|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulhac:  Now its all over|pg||
nt|tomi2:  he will be rewarded with friendly breaks all around except of hearts - the best knws he can get. but Smirnov made 4@H so there will ne no huge swing|pg||
nt|haans: different versions of walsh transfer in sweden we bid only 1nt with S hand|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: still a lot to say by both teams |pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@S shows a @H raise and @S shortness |pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: Styanêli w 5@S|pg||
nt|marlowepi: moi aussi, sans la chance on est perdu|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@C 17+, 1@D 0-7, 1@H art forcing 20+|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Bye all|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: and 3@D= 6 card @D|pg||
nt|oleberg: Operator, are you sure Easts second bid was 2@H and not 2@D?|pg||
mb|d|nt|pitiful:  6@C is a playable spot here|pg||
nt|ftpe: i fully agree|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Unusual with an ace|pg||
nt|othered1:   An unusual treatment.|pg||
nt|lesh: 3@c pupet, 3@H no 4M, 3@s trf to 3nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: E had a difficult lead decision|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Why doesÂ´nt East bid 2 @H in the first round|pg||
nt|haans: NORTH hand|pg||
nt|othered1: both with A and with stiff in partner's suit.|pg||

nt|vasmar: good morning Yuval|pg||
nt|star6ija: I think they managed to play in same directions aiming to be shown on the Vugraph :)|pg||
nt|haans: 1@S to show 2 3 spade no extra|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2@C was forcing to game, so I suppose a 2@S continuation covers all the spade raises.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@H over 2@H would be a @H raise and @D shortness|pg||
nt|othered1: and with no side shortness?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Let me ask giammi|pg||
nt|8252: sans les @s, on a du mal aussi|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: 2 off for sure|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: now at least 2|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@S 0-4|pg||
nt|petergill: or balanced|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: fireworks =X 3nt by North |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: way tis X ?|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: somebody ?|pg||
nt|oleberg: X asked for a diamond-lead, dummy's suit|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: well he knows |pg||
pc|s6|nt|eweber: while this one would only promise a swing if the open NS pair weren't playing strong NT, but they are|pg||
nt|ady: now 6 easy tricks    I am sure a 7th will come|pg||
nt|shevek: I'm told 2@s is 8-10 , 6@s|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: nice K@C helping card showing to secuence & giving parner a relax moment to tell him your lead made no damagge to defence|pg||
nt|marlowepi: meme cela revient a la chance:)|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 1- both opps are not strong |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 2- he has the @D controled |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 3-he has a lot of confidence |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 15/1 up|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 4- is not a part score not much dange on this x|pg||
nt|oleberg: Or at least the double shows, that diamonds is controlled, and south should be vary, leading from honours|pg||
nt|ralfwil: this lead makes that N can win the @d immediately and return another @s|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: tricks count |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: East |pg||
nt|oleberg: 3@D must have been invitational, so the double is "safe"|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 3@S+2@H+1@C=7 |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: he needs to develope the @D |pg||
nt|ralfwil: only 6 tricks from top, so let us see|pg||
nt|oleberg: the lead is a killer|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: sorry 6 yes |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: remember siesta time for Spanish people |pg||
nt|oleberg: This will always take at least 7 tricks, 6 obvious ones, and seventh cannot help but being devellopped|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: Siesta= good life in spain / relax moment and here we are fighting in this match :)|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|pitiful:  safe play by declarer|pg||
nt|mamos: making safe|pg||
nt|pitiful:  leaving trump in dummy to ruff @s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2NT= asking for min/max and distribution. Denies @S raise, may have @H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So they go through 2NT with a balanced heart raise|pg||
pc|s3|nt|boyklas: 5C at boar 12|pg||
nt|rnmalik: would require some play.|pg||
nt|andersk: this contract is not makeable|pg||
nt|pitiful:  i saw symonds play the other night for Surrey|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|haans: do not understand low spade|pg||
nt|Walddk7: At TGR they would probably play this in 3NT in order collect 150 honours|pg||
nt|petergill: This gives declarer an entry to dummy for the doomed trump finesse|pg||
pc|h5|nt|boyklas: boar|pg||
nt|shevek: I think it also suggests shortage in @h|pg||
nt|chick: can make 6, but I predict only 5 ... will set up @Ds, they will knock out the other @S stopper, and he won't dare take the @H finesse|pg||
nt|petergill: Declarer has to misguess a lot in order to fail|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Welcome to Jaap Frijling|pg||
pc|h3|nt|collins64: Mike 14 HCP opening is not going to run good here|pg||
nt|eweber: wow, another 11 for NL|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Spade lead looked normal|pg||
nt|athene: lauria-versace got some way towards 4@H - just not all the way|pg||
nt|pitiful:  you mentioned flash boys|pg||
nt|lesh: with doubleton Q@d and Q@c and @H finess working he can even make 12 tricks|pg||
pc|h2|nt|peachy: 3Nt was better since hearts 4-4, but one never knows|pg||
nt|chick: hmm, now he may have to take the @H finesse|pg||
nt|lesh: however,what is more important is to make your contract|pg||
nt|jkotor: lol, dosta³em na priv pytanie, |pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|rnmalik: cannot rule out an error by the defense.|pg||
nt|eweber: 26:4 now|pg||
nt|MolvaM: the iceland pairs doing extremely well in the event|pg||
nt|jaapfr: hoi Roland et all:)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|MolvaM: one pair ranked 1st in butler with 1,66 imp/board|pg||
nt|MolvaM: other 2 pairs also high with 0,84 and 0,3 plus|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 1,66 imp average over 100 boards is phenomenal|pg||
nt|xenya: well at least it served as a lead director|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 9@D a very strong card in N|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Gerben42: thanks to the 3@S opener|pg||
pc|s5|nt|boyklas: Dehaye didnt find the S lead so again some imps for greece|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 8 tricks|pg||
nt|petergill: Their system wrongsided the hand - "calling a spade a spade" works a bit better on this hand|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|h_karluk: yesterday i was in Florence SC, USA sectional, a young lady offered me for an interview to their local TV channel. Her question was "what's the best thing in this game". I think ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 'try to improve your judgement skills' was a fair answer.|pg||
nt|petergill: OK now|pg||
pc|d2|nt|Gerben42: 3NT is a claimer|pg||
nt|roswolf: israel made 4@S ON 9 BUT had some opp bidding to help them|pg||
nt|shevek: iceland lost their 1st match to italy (14-16)|pg||
nt|shevek: after that won 10 in a row|pg||
nt|andreasw:  must have been a good match|pg||
nt|petergill: EW lead 2nd and 4th |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|Gerben42: looks they finally start scoring|pg||
nt|eweber: right, over 2@s life is so much easier!|pg||
nt|peachy: yes indeed it did, having stuff in all other suits|pg||
nt|othered1: ty|pg||
nt|othered1: lost of possible variations here, including a cross-ruff with thos good trump spots|pg||
pc|d7|nt|rigas_karo: discrding the diamond costs a trick, -1 now|pg||
nt|lmeili: E ll be squeezed|pg||
nt|andersk: 3-2|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|lmeili: not now|pg||
nt|andersk: OMG|pg||
nt|xenya: only 10 tricks now -- in the other room, i think, a spade was led|pg||
nt|oleberg: Declarer might be banking South having no diamonds, since he didn't lead one|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: going for the @H gives him te 7t trick |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: looks like |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 500 |pg||
nt|ralfwil: a @c back and @s10|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: -2 x = 500 for Iceland trying to do a comeback |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: any back excepto te J@S|pg||
nt|ralfwil: N will know a lot about Easts distribution 4522|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and also S|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and better @c to @cQ and another @c|pg||
pc|s7|nt|mcarroll: 3-=2!!!|pg||
nt|andersk: stil 1,5 minutes left|pg||
nt|andersk: 2,5 minutes left|pg||
nt|ady: now 7|pg||
nt|shevek: this one looks like yet another one :)|pg||
nt|othered1: Declarer is looking for best way to 10 tricks, not for an overtrick|pg||
pc|sK|nt|Gerben42: if they win 22-8 they have 39, which is not great but getting back in|pg||
nt|ady: tried for 9|pg||
nt|MolvaM: for me a good match is when I win it|pg||
nt|brolucius: If this sort of deal appears in a problem book (where you are meant to see if you can deal with bad breaks in hearts and/or clubs), I usually turn the page to see the answer ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: straight away. I suppose - somewhere in the  universe - there is a hard-working bridge player who spends ages trying to work out the answers to such problems.|pg||
nt|james_h: North has only shown the @s for his effort => he has the @c K|pg||
pc|sT|nt|andersk: this will be 1 or 2 down|pg||
nt|james_h: @sA|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|ralfwil: and declater had only 6 tricks|pg||
pc|hA|nt|collins64: Mike is very lucky here !!  not a very good defence |pg||

pc|h4|pc|d6|nt|Gerben42: of course Russia will have something against that|pg||

nt|jameslee 2: and x@H|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|andersk: 3 down now|pg||
nt|haans: ERROR|pg||
nt|othered1: North is one of those players who seems to get the answers without turning the page,  however.|pg||
nt|brolucius: He has worked hard at the game in the past, you can be sure.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Lauria probably turns the page and says: this answer is wrong.|pg||
nt|othered1: :)|pg||
nt|othered1: The @C duck isn't a play I had foreseen.|pg||
nt|oleberg: Just play hearts, and get away with down -1|pg||
nt|oleberg: It is often difficult to maximize defence in such situations|pg||
pc|hK|nt|chick: from making 6 to down 1|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 30-35|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: other table hand before 5@C not double a swing te of 200  5 for Iceland |pg||
pc|h8|nt|dburn: careful play, that @sQ, just in case West was doing something fiendish|pg||
nt|petergill: 650 - she could safely have got 680 after @C7 then @C8 by East - only an overtrick  |pg||
nt|ralfwil: but N didn´t use the count|pg||
pc|d8|pc|hJ|pg||
pc|h6|pc|hQ|nt|oleberg: East's strenght, (and placement of highcards) is unknown, so the defence goes for the sure set, happy to defeat a contract, that might have made if not for the double|pg||

nt|henryb:  since our operator is not at the table, he cannot provide meanings of bids|pg||
mb|p|mb|4D|mb|p|mb|4H|nt|sastro: you see the time is over when a partnership bids 3 time a suit that they hold more than 2 cards in that suit|pg||

mb|p|mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s3|nt|henryb:  it is a very lucky hand: needs the @dJ onside and to be aboe to take 3 @d tricks, which means 3-3 or AJ doubleton|pg||

mb|1S|nt|Gerben42: but 10-13 look solid Dutch results|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 4@S|pg||
nt|vasmar: 4@H is a playable contract for N-S|pg||
nt|athene: 2@C is hearts, weak or strong, or strong balanced|pg||
nt|xenya:  i'm told that 2@D was not a multi but a 5M-4m 2-suiter|pg||
nt|xenya: 2@D=18-19|pg||
nt|xenya: so another dull hand|pg||
nt|ftpe: normal 4 he here|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: WE HAVE A TECHNICAL PROBLEM|pg||
nt|xenya: i'm a bit surprised by the pause|pg||
nt|xenya: ah|pg||
nt|xenya: hope you fix it soon|pg||
nt|xenya: anyway, the Estonian W in the OR did well to get hearts right. making an overtrick and possibly gaining an imp for his side|pg||
nt|ftpe: yes|pg||
nt|xenya: this is getting serious i fear...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i always enjoy, never let anybody ruins my day|pg||
mb|p|nt|shevek: 4@s might be a reasonable spot here|pg||
mb|1N|nt|andersk: pls correct to minus 3|pg||
nt|eweber: if the medals were given for speed this table would probably qualify :)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: they will have to wait for their partners quite some time throughout the tournament|pg||
nt|Gerben42: Bauke Muller is not known to be fast|pg||
nt|eweber: 1@d here showed 11-16 with 4+ @d, unbalanced|pg||
nt|Gerben42: showing 4+@D paid off here|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 5@S still cheap for 300|pg||
nt|eweber: and the limit is useful as well|pg||
nt|eweber: in such auctions|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 6@D must be defended carefully, but I think after @S2 lead Drijver will get it|pg||
nt|eweber: with 7 hcp in @s 5@s is an option|pg||
nt|vasmar: double now|pg||
nt|ady: played a diamond to the 9 early on to make 4@S on board 9|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D game try in hearts perhaps but NS should wander into 4@S without too much difficulty |pg||
nt|athene: 3@S pass 4@S now|pg||
nt|pitiful:  5@c a nice spot here|pg||
nt|justin c: might try 6@H here|pg||
mb|p|nt|shevek: Unfortunately losing 2@h - 1@d - 1@c|pg||
nt|lesh: 4@h and 4@s are making,just need to be reached|pg||
nt|petergill: OK, David is right, if @SK was from KJ doubleton the play for the overtrick risks the contract|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzng: the CR send me -2 will check|pg||
nt|andersk: ok|pg||
nt|brolucius: E/W play the weak 1NT, as we saw a deal or two ago, so they open 1@D here.|pg||

mb|2S|nt|Gerben42: at least the auction heated up some :)|pg||
nt|eweber: no double?|pg||
nt|tomi2:  1@S might have longer clubs than spades, I hope he alerted this :)|pg||
nt|andersk: stoppage time now|pg||
nt|haans: Cullin have it|pg||
nt|ady: very thin balance|pg||
nt|athene: now we have to find the club lead|pg||
nt|pitiful:  Roland is probably glued to the cricket at this moment|pg||
nt|MolvaM: elimination possibilities|pg||
nt|haans: 5@D looked like beginner bridge|pg||

mb|p|nt|collins64: 5@c just made for Greece|pg||
nt|santyclz: Protecting the @hAQ.  Didn't see that coming.|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt not a bad shot - even when a minor-suit lead is right for the defence it's going to be hard for east to find it|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: West trying to disturb bidding |pg||
nt|h_karluk: x and cue|pg||
mb|4D|nt|vasmar: small diamond lead :)|pg||
nt|pitiful:  2@s will play ok|pg||
nt|MolvaM: academic now|pg||
nt|xenya: back to life|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 4@D?|pg||
nt|oleberg: 4@D = This distribution (And 2@h also showed minimum)|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 5/4/4/0 ?showing shape with void @C |pg||
nt|oleberg: Yes|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Do you all pass as S after 1@s opening? not for me. 3@c|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: nice |pg||
nt|oleberg: after 2@S 2NT would have shown a balanced hand|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: lets see if West  can stop in game |pg||
mb|p|nt|ziff:  No insider jokes please :)|pg||
nt|tomi2:  maybe there will be an appeal and in september they will decide...|pg||
nt|haans: 5@D a make 2|pg||
nt|andersk: OMG ITALY MISSED FROM 5 meters 5 min over stopppage time|pg||
nt|haans: 6@D a make if @H lead|pg||
nt|yuval10: small @s would've been great|pg||
nt|yuval10: then they force declarer|pg||
nt|haans: more likely that E have the Q rather than A = weaker hand|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: they must be aware they having a poor set so might go for 6@h|pg||
nt|oleberg: 3@C and higher shows the intire distribution|pg||
mb|4S|nt|vugraphzng: NO DOUBLE APPARENTLY|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: sorry for upcqse|pg||
nt|Gerben42: Rudakov didnt know what 5@D showed in defense and Khven didn't count on @DA I guess|pg||
nt|paulhac:  An OK slam|pg||
nt|lmeili: how to show longer @d than @s?|pg||
nt|mamos: was 2@h single or two suited ?  the latter I think|pg||
nt|shevek: phantom got in the way|pg||
nt|MolvaM: tahts the problems with phantoms|pg||
nt|shevek: won't cost much though|pg||
nt|MolvaM: they should stick to hanging out in the operas|pg||
mb|p|nt|shevek: will get away with -50|pg||
nt|shevek: instead of +50|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzng: seems to be clqi;end for -2, correction will come later if needed|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Diamonds 3-3 or doubleton J|pg||
nt|andersk: I have to go for a few|pg||
nt|tomi2:  he upgraded his hand to 18 with those aces and kings|pg||
nt|snetram:  teraz operator|pg||
mb|p|nt|vasmar: now small diamond works also|pg||
nt|vasmar: if S misguesses|pg||
nt|ady: low diamond lead will beat this|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: puppet + 3@s showing hearts|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: there he is nice 4@S|pg||
pc|cT|nt|eweber: non vul doubling for -1 is a bad bargain when the contract may be made, none of them knows about the opther one's quick tricks|pg||
nt|ady: thlow spade lead also good enough|pg||
nt|mamos: just Hearts I'm told|pg||
nt|andreasw:  they were not in 4@s|pg||
nt|shevek: phantoms , yes :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Ivan was good enough to find it, grats|pg||

nt|oleberg: Well, 12 tricks are easy, on the friendly lay.|pg||
nt|ralfwil: 6@s as @d are AJ|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: hand 13 playing 3NT but other side & not X |pg||
pc|cK|nt|peachy: nicely judged|pg||
nt|peachy: as it is, 12 tricks|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Unless he takes a diamond finesse|pg||
nt|peachy: if they duck club, it will be testy|pg||
nt|brolucius: If yo use 12-14 and 15-17 as your ranges for 1NT and the 1NT rebid, a jump rebid of 2NT shows 18-19. They must do something different since West has only 17 here.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Hardly worth an upgrade, with those intermediates, it would seem.|pg||
nt|tomi2:  @S2 gives you the count of the spades, they should behave 4-4|pg||
nt|othered1: Giving an extra Work point or two when  you have only aces and kings is reasaonable, perhaps mandatory|pg||
pc|c6|nt|ady: heart contract for 9 tricks best  |pg||
nt|haans: he had been thinking|pg||
nt|mcarroll: They dont listen to you Hans :)|pg||
nt|haans: see that|pg||
nt|haans: why not clubs to 9|pg||
nt|star6ija: 3rd hand plays high?|pg||

nt|roswolf: might be a few twists and turns though|pg||
nt|star6ija: no entries for dummy|pg||

pc|sA|nt|andersk: ty|pg||
nt|Gerben42: @H ruff is -2 |pg||
nt|yuval10: she indeed misguessed|pg||
nt|athene: small club after the @DA gives declarer a nasty moment but the odds must be to rise king|pg||
nt|athene: west would indeed lead low from @CQJxx, knowing the suit has to run, but it's more likely he simply has the ace|pg||
nt|aldek: non-vulnerable could be very weak|pg||
nt|mamos: not a great bid then imho   it made any exploration of the hands here impossible|pg||
nt|shevek: Thomas would've bid 4@s if it came around|pg||
nt|andreasw:  and then u could bid 5@c with the risk of being dbl but still u never now|pg||
nt|shevek: true, they bid it to make|pg||

nt|marlowepi: en toute probabilite, 300 a 5Kx je crois|pg||
nt|justin c: west might have preferred 4@C to 4@h |pg||
nt|petergill: NS play Two Way Checkback after 1@H - 1@S - 1NT|pg||
nt|petergill: so 2@C would have been artificial|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: instead E is playing West|pg||
pc|c5|nt|shevek: flat board|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes|pg||

nt|jkmjanusz: 2@D,2@S,2@C|pg||

pc|cJ|nt|vasmar: plenty of tricks now for N-S nut not enough ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 18.3 on the K&R so an upgrade was fine|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|rigas_karo: @d now for -3|pg||
nt|yuval10: big board for Germany|pg||
nt|ady: south likely to discard 2 diamonds and a club|pg||
nt|roswolf: well i think this can make by force but timing needs to be exacrt|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer went against Restricted Choice in the heart suit.|pg||
nt|jkotor: Janusz jedn¹ lewê zdejmij|pg||
pc|hA|nt|paulhac:  He may be able to work out the distribution in which case he may well go off|pg||
nt|peachy: cashing spades to get information on shapes and discards, not sure if it will help him|pg||
nt|santyclz: I'm sure I could convince myself to go wrong there.|pg||
nt|athene: now Mari gets squeezed in the minors|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: sweden made another 5 Imp,s move on board 13|pg||
nt|h_karluk: c u Jivko|pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: A, tak jedno Karo i jedno Pik jest wspólne...|pg||
pc|h4|nt|tomi2:  couldnt he first duck out a club?|pg||
nt|brolucius: 10-x or J-x with South was more likely than J-10-x.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, as a matter of principle they don't read books by Englishmen. They beat them in football instead|pg||
nt|tomi2:  :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: A matter of Principle.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ziff:  Don t listen, Phoebe, it is about an appeal in Germany in another sequence where a possible canape was not alerted|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Has to keep @D3 as 2nd @D entry to dummy|pg||
nt|petergill: Would a @H to the ace and the club finesse work better?|pg||
nt|jaapfr: helpful duck/|pg||
pc|hK|nt|dburn: although it will now - West needed to win that trick|pg||
pc|h9|nt|peachy: defense is not helping at all:) wd|pg||

nt|dburn: but she may still be OK if she pitches her club...|pg||

pc|h5|pc|c2|nt|oleberg: With the friendly lay in diamonds, the heart loser could have gone away on the fourth diamond|pg||

pc|h7|nt|ady: did need the diamond lead|pg||
pc|c7|nt|brolucius: Around 10% of bridge players dispute the validity of Restricted Choice. The other 90% have a good laugh about that and collect the 2-to-1 odds in their favour.|pg||
nt|tomi2:  he is playing for some non existing squeece chances now, ducking a club first would allow him to win with clubs 3-2 if you believe the opening lead. if clubs are not 3-2 you can try to find the hearts and have additional information about the sp|pg||
nt|brolucius: With two suits bid, it is a bit more likely than normal that the 2 lead is from a three-card suit. But still a fair chance that spades are 4-4.|pg||
pc|s4|pc|hT|pg||
nt|oleberg: But discarding the diamond guarded against some unfriendly lays|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d3|nt|boyklas: 3H at board 13 by e-w at the OR|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am reminded that, of course, the Italians play attitude leads. So any 4th-best inference are misplaced.|pg||
nt|tomi2:  so they lead the same from Hxxx2?|pg||
pc|d4|nt|tomi2:  sry, then I take back most of my comments|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|ralfwil: after the @d discard only 11 tricks. the only way to get 12 tricks is a good @d split|pg||

nt|othered1: Given the junk they open, north may not be overly aggressive, especially if the @D duplication is known.|pg||
nt|othered1: I wonder why the overcall rather than a double?|pg||
mb|p|mb|5D|nt|othered1: west likely will get involved as well, making this a far different auction than in CR, where NS found slam entirely on their own.|pg||
nt|henryb:  tough for N to do the winning thing here|pg||
nt|othered1: 5 will be down, so CR won't be much of a loss, unless north passes (forcing?) and sits for south's double|pg||
nt|othered1: Once upon a time, Al Roth counselled "never temporize with 4-card trump support."   Keeps hands like north's from having to show support at very high levels.|pg||
mb|6D|mb|p|mb|6H|mb|p|nt|othered1: I know 2@C is relay and is the only way to bid north's hand in their system.  Still doesn't make it easy to bring south into the decision process until fit is known.  Just a price ...|pg||

nt|tomi2:  2/3 of German top pairs play negative free bids|pg||
nt|marlowepi: a mon avis, N devrait dire 4K car assez souvent S aura une main ou le sacrifice serait bon. esperer que les adveaux empaillent la manche n'est pas tres realiste, et esperer battre ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4P est aussi trop optimiste|pg||
nt|marlowepi: l;'enchere de 4K propose un sacrifice a S|pg||
mb|4H|nt|rigas_karo: i think he could go 2 down actually if he cashed one round of trumps after north overuffed with the A@h|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Negative free bids, like 2@C here, are popular in some places|pg||
nt|chick: 4 of either major should make|pg||
nt|jkotor: potrójny trefl obk³ada koñcówkê na nadbitce|pg||
nt|lechcold: 3@H nieforsuj¹ce teraz?|pg||
nt|oleberg: And wise of declarer not to use to much energy on that|pg||
mb|p|nt|vasmar: Spade lead and continuation may set it i think|pg||
nt|andreasw:  not if @h AJx sit's by west and @s K on east:)|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: Swill just stop in 4@H|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @dJ on side is 50% so....|pg||
mb|4N|nt|collins64: it looks like it was a quick pass from North|pg||
nt|ady: anyone know what 1@H is    not alert?|pg||
nt|ftpe: yes|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@S max with 5 spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: NT will be a poor strain this time, one can only hope they dont bid 3|pg||
nt|lmeili: good gor Germany, no double|pg||
nt|pitiful:  interesting lead for south|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: chance here if E/W can produce some red cards|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: actually plays quite well 3@d be close|pg||
nt|petergill: Even if you play Simple Stayman, responding 3@H or 3@S with a max with a 5 card suit to simple Stayman is a pretty good idea IMO, rarely costs|pg||
nt|petergill: No reason to get spades wrong, as far as I can see|pg||
mb|5D|nt|boyklas: -2 now with a small H|pg||
nt|eweber: and now the wrong hand decl. in a spade contract|pg||
nt|ziff:  No double, no trouble|pg||
nt|pitiful:  how many down?|pg||
mb|p|nt|eweber: and probably no chance to find the 2nd fit|pg||
nt|motu: hard to dbl for N|pg||
nt|MolvaM: now a non heart lead could bring overtrivk|pg||
nt|andreasw:  will bring a overtrcik but a @h lead look's fair|pg||
nt|andreasw:  then again east could have dbl 1@h|pg||
nt|andreasw:  for the lead|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: a part score 3@C |pg||

nt|oleberg: the defence to 5@h will be interesting|pg||
nt|oleberg: The @SA cannot be taken prematurely|pg||
mb|6H|nt|MolvaM: would that just ask for a lead or show a real suit?|pg||
nt|andreasw:  well done!|pg||

nt|lechcold: wygl¹da ¿e to nie idzie|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: over @s lead, S needs to signal what she has|pg||

nt|dburn: well, he has six tricks|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 9 tricks |pg||

nt|ryskiel_: a seniorsi 48-30 z Walij¹|pg||
nt|oleberg: And a squeeze of East is lurking, but much to double-dummy to find|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: Not sure what subesequent bidding showed. |pg||
nt|hawe45:  South throws trick away|pg||
nt|athene: NS lead attitude against notrumps - definitely favoured amongst the top italian players|pg||
nt|dburn: so I guess that's four down|pg||
nt|pitiful:  i was thinking 3|pg||
mb|p|nt|vasmar: true|pg||
nt|yuval10: will help P not to play @c here|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 1 imp for wales now|pg||
nt|oleberg: the defence to 6@H should be possible to find|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: Iceland on the lead 16/15 |pg||
nt|ralfwil: too high is always selfdefending:)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|vasmar: she must continue spades now|pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: Nie - Operator sie grobn¹³. Rozgrywaka jeszcze trwqa|pg||
pc|sT|nt|dburn: yes, but you're not defending|pg||
nt|pitiful:  i know 4 looks likely but sometimes 1 gets away |pg||
nt|dburn: oh, sure - no one ever believes how bad the contract actually is|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: time for a good think by east |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: A@S or not ?|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: A@S makes = 12 tricks asOle told us |pg||
nt|oleberg: No 11|pg||
nt|ralfwil: If my partner lead @s2 he has an honour..... |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: so defence needs to put J@S|pg||
nt|oleberg: There is always a heart-loser|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: true there is a 9@H problem there good point by specs|pg||
nt|oleberg: But the @SJ will keep declarer to 10 tricks|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|snetram:  tu moÅ¼e byc bez jednej|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: I think S meant 2NT as pick a minor over 3@C would decide whether to pass or not|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|Gerben42: 13 tops now |pg||
nt|petergill: With 9 trumps, you play for the drop, and with 8 trumps you finesse the queen, unless the bidding and/or play suggests otherwise |pg||
nt|oleberg: It is always 11 (thx kibz) |pg||
pc|h6|nt|dburn: for example, Brink may not believe he can give Drijver a spade ruff, because that would mean East's bidding is completely berserk|pg||
nt|pitiful:  surely not Ace|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ziff:  The contract could be cold, or he might give away the position|pg||
nt|vasmar: now it makes easily|pg||

nt|tomi2:  Dr. Wladow always makes his grands|pg||

nt|vugraphzng: break I mean|pg||
nt|yuval10: thx operator|pg||
nt|vasmar: but boards 14 and 15 are good for Germany|pg||
nt|vasmar: probably they will take the lead|pg||
nt|ady: will west pre-empt with 4 cards in other major?|pg||
nt|haans: spade 4-0 to much|pg||
nt|shevek: this 6@s is claimable at trick 1|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes and should be reach easy|pg||
nt|xenya: bordering on a slam though, as the cards lie|pg||
nt|brolucius: A reliable guide, in such circumstances, is to play the method that most top players use. It is their job, so they would not choose to play a second-rate method. If, say, 80% of ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: players use a new suit as forcing, then go with the crowd.|pg||
nt|ritong: bonjour a tous|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: who would have guessed 210 wins |pg||
nt|eweber: the warm up phase is definitely over, these boards contain explosives!|pg||
nt|ady: should be a lot of bidding here |pg||
nt|tomi2:  I prefere most playing transfers in this situation, you lose the (non) forcing 2@C bid but gain so many bids else|pg||
nt|8252: oui, il n'a pas d'enchère facile, mais passe est vraiment passif|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 75% played |pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: that result doesn't seem likely, unless he played it the same way as he bid it|pg||

nt|tomi2:  In poland 99.9 % play non forcing, in Germany we have lots of influences in bidding and defense, some from French bidding style, some from American books and some from Polish players, because some German players are Polish origin, like Piekarek |pg||

nt|xenya: now 2 hearts pitching 2 diamonds -- that must be his plan?|pg||
nt|ftpe: he probably knows cl 3-3, so maybe will play on clubs|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|vasmar: there may be a club spade squeeze|pg||

pc|dT|nt|paulg:  bidding 4@c would have given someone the option of running if doubled (although never easy to work out when to run) ... 4@d has no such safety valve|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Could easily play East for KQ@C doubleton and go for 800|pg||

nt|jameslee 2: big smash there fron denmark |pg||
pc|s6|nt|pitiful:  didn't cash their @s|pg||

nt|Walddk2: In the finals the 9 teams from one group will play against the 9 from the other group and an aggregate score is calculated|pg||
nt|tomi2:  Italy and Iceland have quite confortable leads, they can try to relax in matches agains teams, that will be relegated for sure and save some energy and avoid time penalties (don't know if penalties are also carried into 2nd RR)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Six teams will qualify for the Bermuda Bowl - the top six in the second round-robin. At the moment the field is split into two, so around the top 3 in each section may be seen as ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: the top contenders at present. But there is some luck involved in which of your scores are dropped after the first round-robin.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Penalties are carried forward if both teams qualify, not if only one of them|pg||

nt|kdr_fm: this looks makeable - whats the best way to handle diamonds ?  guess @dA and ruff one ... |pg||
nt|petergill: South played the opening bidder for @HQ on the last hand in order to make up her 12 HCP for her opening bid - surely?|pg||

pc|hA|nt|rigas_karo: with a @h lead, the paly will be very fast...|pg||
nt|motu: i guess he can find the @D position|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @D-shift from North looks needed|pg||
nt|athene: the defence have to lead diamonds at some point|pg||
nt|athene: before declarer gets the clubs going and throws two diamonds on spade and the last club|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Good pass by Magnusson|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A Zia double. "Try to double every time you have the queen in their suit; they will then play your partner for it"|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Donne 11 Chemla nÂ´as pas ouvert comme Sud = pas de chelem|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|tomi2:  official scoresheet says 3nt-1 and the play looks like|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Oh, I am asked to tell what the USA1 team is. I will, of course|pg||
nt|snetram:  trudno uwierzyc w licytacje|pg||
nt|eamongall: is there a repechage event in this competition or do the losers just go home and play golf |pg||
nt|bernix: keeping @sK in dummy, just in case he needs a 2nd ruff|pg||
nt|dburn: well judged|pg||
nt|petergill: West needs perfect cards for slam - Axx, AQxx, xxx, Qxx - so she wisely passes  |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: declarer not with many tricks looks an imposible contract|pg||
pc|h9|nt|eweber: a festival for the weak NT players who find their @s fit :)|pg||
nt|athene: not at all easy for north to lead from Qxx round to Jxx though|pg||
nt|haans: He asked and got NO|pg||
nt|pitiful:  this is a nice spot for e-w|pg||
nt|ftpe: 3 nt was hard bid|pg||
nt|xenya: normal to bid 3N on 25 points, but the game is very thin|pg||
nt|ftpe: punish will come, even if lucky lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Fleisher-Kamil, Weinstein-Levin, Stansby-Martel|pg||
nt|tomi2:  I am not a fan of redoubles with hands that have only one thing to say... "I have support and some values". Redouble for me should mean "I want to double the opps" but it is so unlikely for W that he will get opps...|pg||
nt|brolucius: If you play negative bids over a double, you need to use redouble more - I guess.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Funnily enough this is all about @HQ, is it now?|pg||
nt|othered1: I prefer redouble denies fit, unless game force.|pg||
nt|tomi2:  more often opps will preempt you in spades and partner will not know about your fit when its his turn to bid. You should have a bid in your system to show a constructive or invitational raise directly|pg||
nt|tomi2:  best again is to use transfers :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: transfers are useful in many sequences but no-one ever seems to write a magazine article about them. (Must prefer to keep the advantages to themselves...)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Gromöller is a hot favourite to go down. He must lose two spades and one diamond, and why would he play South for @HQ after the take-out double?|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|ritong: rumen va d abord essayer de faire tomber le @d V|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|rnmalik: and thought well:)|pg||
nt|tomi2:  my gues is: his intention was "pd pls bid 3nt with a spade stopper"|pg||
nt|athene: it could easily give tricks away|pg||
nt|athene: i assume that @D4 is the @H4|pg||
nt|hawe45:  East found the shift|pg||
nt|andreasw:  if denmark wins now free beer for all|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: good question Eamon - most events have a final B with the top x teams allowed back in ... not sure|pg||
pc|s5|nt|xenya: N was sort of endplayed on the lead -- any suit he might lead (except @Cs) gives away a trick|pg||
nt|psridhar: are they saving vul vs nv on a 4-4? looks 500 to me|pg||
nt|bernix: there is a transnational. i'd prefer golf|pg||
pc|h8|nt|paulg:  12 tricks looks a lot at the other table|pg||
nt|haans: play clubs at sonest|pg||
nt|haans: soonest|pg||
nt|vasmar: i think that in hearts there are a lot of tricks for N-S|pg||
nt|pitiful:  should make 10 on the layout|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: after @H North will be told where to go after with a signal|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|santyclz: @c back looks safer than @d.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Still tempting though|pg||
nt|shevek: coffee hand is when you need to go to the bathroom and pretend you go to the kitchen :)|pg||
nt|chick: in any case, EW found a makeable game|pg||
nt|chick: won't be easy with the awful trump split, but he has a lot of resources outside of trump|pg||
nt|me argent: tout marche pour lui|pg||
pc|h7|nt|haans: true always is|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: good 4@S if -1 =200 for a 420 opps |pg||
nt|ritong: si ça ne marche pas, il lui restera la solution des @ss|pg||
nt|8252: oui, mais bon coloris, à SA, -10 au lieu de - 11 :)|pg||
nt|ritong: mais ça marchera|pg||
pc|d2|nt|paulhac:  Looks like 12 on this lead also|pg||
nt|vasmar: now 1NT will go 1 off probably|pg||
nt|vasmar: 4 hearts + 3 Aces|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: but seems a 500 againtx a 420|pg||
pc|c2|nt|mcarroll: not enough dummy entries to trap @HK so will lose 2@D,1@S and the @HK|pg||
nt|haans: sweden DOWN|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3@D should be gf and if so west could have bid 3@S when a slam would be reached|pg||
nt|lechcold: do taryfy chyba brakuje 2 Impów?|pg||
nt|petergill: There are far more hands where 5@H goes down than ones where 6@h makes, excellent judgement by Stockdale|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: I think he will discard a @C|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|athene: declarer really played a diamond, not a trump, at trick 2?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Doesn't seems likely.|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 2@C = mean = @D |pg||
pc|h4|nt|rnmalik: Cant play @S that would squeeze the hand.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|eweber: ... or play 1@c|pg||
nt|lmeili: wd!|pg||
nt|MolvaM: coffee hands are the type of hands that allow you to go and get a cup of coffee from the kitchen without worrying about what extremely clever remark you can do here as commentator|pg||
nt|tomi2:  he knows now @DQ in north, so not many points left for south. maybe some bad clue, but better than no clue ;)|pg||
nt|othered1: north might have ruffed to play @S through, at possible cost of trump trick|pg||
nt|tomi2:  I am told that the systematic meaning of xx is "10+, often no @H fit", hmm|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Club exit won't help declarer|pg||
nt|brolucius: Clever line of play.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: North rates to have more hearts than South after the double, so it would be against the odds to finesse through South|pg||
nt|brolucius: More important to have your hand in the bulletin than to actually win the match.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Versace could easily have had @CQ instead of @HQ|pg||
nt|tomi2:  spades should be 4-4|pg||
nt|othered1: Whne I play @DK from dummy, south's lead was from J10xx|pg||
nt|tomi2:  dias are 2north and 3 south|pg||
nt|lechcold: kto by siê tego spodziewa³? du¿a, przyjemna niespodzianka|pg||
nt|eamongall: but wait ...at first glance greece have 3 plus scores on 18-20 ...there might be some singing yet in austria |pg||
pc|c5|pc|c3|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 1@C is forcing for me :)|pg||
nt|eweber: for those who don't know, Gerben preferably plays Fantunes|pg||
nt|tomi2:  so if clubs are 4-4, north has longer hearts, if 5-3 south has longer hearts|pg||
pc|c7|nt|haans: and he should have|pg||
nt|andreasw:  for me it's smooking hand:)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  smoking|pg||
nt|ftpe: 1 nt opening showing 15-17, having 8 as prd, pass is rigth i think, max. is 25 and 8 had no extra|pg||
pc|c4|nt|tomi2:  and having 4 spades is enough for an Italian player to double, can't remember an Italian TO double on 4144 :)|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cA|pg||
pc|s2|nt|roswolf: i think west was a bit lazy here|pg||
nt|eamongall: this one looks like an EW score so no hope there |pg||
pc|s4|nt|eweber: good duck from East here|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, i think E overbid -- possibly for tactical reasons though|pg||
nt|eamongall: I am looking at any hope of austria getting through |pg||
nt|bernix: losing to monaco was the nail in the coffing|pg||
nt|eamongall: well austria have certainly done their best here ...currently standing at the maximum 25|pg||
pc|sA|nt|tomi2:  interesting positions, I got 10 msg now with THE best line|pg||
nt|tomi2:  @HQ is a nice falsecard|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Brilliant|pg||
nt|tomi2:  makes GromÃ¶ller believe Lauria has the 3rd heart|pg||
nt|tomi2:  so @D pitches will not work|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|ady: will make 12 tricks in spades as they lay|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: board 15 other tavle also in 6@H|pg||
pc|s6|nt|Walddk2: Gromöller will think Lauria has the last trump|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|tomi2:  but would have Lauria played the @H9 from 984?|pg||
nt|brolucius: South knows that declarer has a void club, otherwise he would have led towards the @CK.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Would Versace have played a heart from Qxx?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He did|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|ftpe: what tactical reason?|pg||
pc|c6|nt|paulg:  when dummy goes down your first thought would be about making the contract, not two overtricks|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: Line for +1 is @cK finesse @cJ cash @CA and finesse @h9 - all abit risky|pg||
pc|c8|nt|paulhac:  True|pg||
nt|eamongall: in case we did not mention it ... Sylvia and Franz Terraneo were the austrian NS |pg||
pc|cT|nt|jameslee 2: -1 |pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|roswolf: lots of swings in this match|pg||
nt|ady: not now|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: down 1 |pg||
pc|s3|nt|haans: sweden UP again|pg||
pc|s9|nt|brolucius: A splendid tussle! Worth the entry money on its own.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He could have endplayed Versace with a diamond, but he was deceived by the @HQ return|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is a great hand!|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer could have made by playing a good diamond, for a spade discard if South did not ruff. But he placed the last trump with North. |pg||
pc|sT|nt|mcarroll: and Down again!|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|dT|pc|dQ|pc|dA|pc|d3|pg||

mb|p|mb|1S|mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|mb|2S|nt|othered1: one of those 20-20 hands, where one side or the other gets amazingly high, like in CR.  4 level with 8 trumps 2 aces and one king and no double.|pg||

nt|henryb:  I guess @s can make 10 tricks by dropping the @sQ|pg||
nt|othered1: North doesn't have an unfriendly play  here.  @H will let declarer ruff one in dummy, which will also force him to pick up trumps|pg||

nt|hawe45:  Penultimate - does that mean, that they doÂ´nt play it...?|pg||
nt|athene: the auction in the other room is about how you would expect|pg||
nt|athene: east shows a monster balanced|pg||
nt|athene: west staymans for 4-4 heart fit and then just bids 3nt|pg||
nt|santyclz: Thanks to our operator, Jean-Jacques Thiry, great job!|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: Apparently they replay the board 9, wait for this one soon|pg||
nt|hawe45:  7 @D is not so bad, @C King dropping or @S-hook|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - or a black suit-lead...|pg||
nt|athene: you don't want to play 7@D on a hand like this where it's really likely they will not even bid 6@D in the other room|pg||

nt|andreasw:  so 10 trick's|pg||
nt|xenya: but this is going to be a huge swing to Estonia|pg||
nt|me argent: la bonne nouvelle est K@S bien placer mais la mauvaise est la partage des atouts|pg||
nt|ritong: meme le grand talent de mari pourrait ne pas venir a bout de celle ci|pg||
nt|eamongall: those of us old enough might also remember a decent Austrian womens team in Euro champs 1991 in Killarney Ireland |pg||
nt|eamongall: they might have even won it but I reckon they definitely medaled|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|tomi2:  don't know where N found a raise to 6 here|pg||
nt|vasmar: probably she thougth that 4@s was a conservative approach|pg||
nt|shevek: can play @hQ now and claim|pg||
nt|bernix: they won it|pg||
nt|jaapfr: if in the endplay you lose 2@D and 2@C it is not really made so need some luck with @CQT|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: who is first will be te winner |pg||
nt|ralfwil: 140/a70 in 3@s so this can go -3|pg||

nt|petergill: NS need @C10, but the don't have it|pg||
nt|petergill: they don't have it|pg||
nt|jaapfr: rite you are|pg||
nt|ralfwil: the @d lead was a killer|pg||
nt|petergill: after the hearts are stripped out, if she plays a club to the 8, EW have to be careful|pg||
nt|rmb1: In OR, defence did not play diamond early and were thrown in late.  But we weren't sure where the tenth trick came from|pg||
nt|petergill: then they have to win @CA, play low @D to W, low @d back to the king, then club|pg||
nt|jillan:  same here, 2 rounds of @S ruff the @H and exit in @D|pg||
nt|ralfwil: Why a killer? opened up the defence|pg||

nt|andreasw:  yes|pg||
nt|haans: yes many are not happy if you do not bid a game that need two finesses|pg||
nt|tomi2:  www.bbotv.com is the link for watching several tables at once, now Sementa is in 4@H but Smirnov lead @CA (after Piekarek found two unforced bid with his ace- and kingless hand)|pg||
nt|chick: yes, 11 tricks is possible, but on a spade lead, I would just cash my 10 tricks and go home :)|pg||

nt|8252: il y a du avoir glissé dans les N° à @c|pg||
nt|jillan:  on this hand, declarer gpt a bit tangled up and went one down|pg||
nt|petergill: It is bold of the England, with four current World Champions in their team, to play their young new pair (Stockdale - Brown) in this vital match against one of the five top teams. |pg||
nt|petergill: Admittedly Stockdale - Brown are topping the datums with +0.93 imps/bd|pg||

mb|d|nt|rnmalik: 4@S or 3NT, both the contracts make for NS.|pg||
nt|xenya: spade was led in the OR i'm told|pg||
nt|xenya: W was declarer there|pg||
nt|ftpe: diffcult to lead ace di|pg||
nt|xenya: the @S lead by N looks normal enough, so i withdraw my criticism|pg||
nt|ftpe: withdraw accepted :)|pg||
nt|xenya: and it looks like another disaster for the Russian team is coming|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: well a valiant effort by austria - couldnt do more but apparently not enough so denmark + portugal get thru - finals start tomorrow|pg||
nt|eamongall: I recall the surname ... there was also Fischer ...like the chess players mane |pg||
nt|eamongall: name |pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: are you going to raise to "a lot"?|pg||
nt|paulg:  a kib suggests at least taking the ace of diamonds to cash five clubs first and then play a diamond ... which saves a trick|pg||
nt|haans: the delay after W bid is because SE are on other side of screen|pg||
nt|ftpe: more imps for estonia here, dont think he can manage|pg||
nt|tomi2:  Piekarek ruffed the 3rd @D with no thought to play a skade, now Sementa will get the @H right I think|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: dziêkujê licznym a znakomitym komentatorom oraz jeszcze bardziej licznym kibicom|pg||
nt|petergill: France has taken a 6 VP lead in the Women's event|pg||
nt|oleberg: West will bid 5@C at some point. Unfortunately, East wont raise|pg||
nt|oleberg: (Unfortunate on this layout)|pg||
nt|ralfwil: what is S thinking of? or is it operator?|pg||
nt|oleberg: It might be West thinking|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I hope so:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|rigas_karo: last hand, good luck to both teams for rest of the tournament|pg||
nt|eweber: looking back all the big imps were won by style, board 8, 9, 14|pg||
nt|paulhac:  True|pg||
nt|tomi2:  now he committes himself to 4 level if pd has no @H fit?|pg||
nt|vasmar: for now Austria gets the lead after the unlucky slam of german|pg||
nt|psridhar: abt 25 % game i reckon ( dia 4-2 wih spd 2-2 also ok)|pg||
nt|oleberg: The oprator cannot use the keyboard before both screenmates have bid|pg||
nt|oleberg: That would give away the tempo|pg||
mb|4S|nt|haans: 2nd opinion: Rado: 2@H weak 5+@H4+m 3@C pass or correct|pg||

nt|eamongall: Doris Fischer I am told |pg||
nt|petergill: At the other table, the bidding might not have been as it is recorded|pg||
nt|jaapfr: tough decision for N|pg||
nt|petergill: 3NT has chances|pg||
nt|petergill: @D7 is the normal lead to 3NT |pg||
nt|jillan:  may even be easier to play the 4@S|pg||
nt|jaapfr: N considers a 4@C 4@H or pass bid |pg||
nt|jillan:  is west likely to find a heart lead?|pg||
nt|petergill: Other table : 1@D showed hearts and 1@H was takeout of hearts|pg||
nt|petergill: No chance of a @h lead to 3NT - East showed 6 @d's, did not show hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|motu: wladow does not know bids like 2NT in such situations|pg||
nt|vasmar: but board 19 will give back the lead to Germany i beleive|pg||
nt|MolvaM: last hand of the match here now|pg||
nt|oleberg: West is doing what he can, to get to 6@C|pg||
nt|oleberg: It helps him, that he is limited to 15 points, partner will know the nature of his hand|pg||
mb|5N|nt|pitiful:  doubled was the stripe tailed ape|pg||
nt|mamos: wow  was that striped ape do you think|pg||
nt|kdr_fm: thx to our commentators eamonn, justin, bernard - vugraph operator and hope to see you all tomorrow for the finals round 1|pg||
nt|jillan:  so this might make then :)|pg||
nt|jaapfr: 4@C the lesser bid so pass or 4@H|pg||
nt|petergill: West (likely) or East (unlikely) will need to find a heart switch, if East puts up @DK on a low @d elad|pg||
mb|p|nt|lmeili: never argue with DR Waldow :)|pg||
nt|reisig: disaster coming|pg||
nt|haans: dont ask|pg||
nt|vasmar: S is happy to pass|pg||
nt|roswolf: east will pass?he is normally very reluctant to pass an invitation|pg||
nt|mcarroll: on 19 4@S was made in Open, to account for most of the lead held by Bulgaria|pg||
nt|pitiful:  or at least he will claim that later|pg||
nt|jaapfr: @H|pg||
mb|6C|nt|cumino: sry|pg||

nt|petergill: Might be hard (impossible) to put @DK on 1D!0 = unlucky|pg||
nt|oleberg: 5NT = Pick a slam (I sincerely hope)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: lol|pg||
nt|MolvaM: many thanks to all our commentators and our specs for their valuable guidance|pg||
nt|haans: 3@S must have been premptive|pg||
nt|marlowepi: je m'etonne a la ligne de jeu, notamment le deuxieme tour d'atout avant de jouer trefle et coeur pour limiter la note si les atouts sont mal partages|pg||
mb|p|nt|andersk: calm finish, so the results as it stands now, is 15-15 in VP|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Its Stayman Jim, but not as we know it?|pg||
nt|ralfwil: a @h lead was Killing|pg||
nt|jaapfr: duck??|pg||
nt|petergill: @D5 = discouraging, as South is "marked' with @DAQJ|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: might be 1 too high    depends on view in trumps|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: very much so 0-6  4 card is the maximum preempitve |pg||
nt|psridhar: but that 3s worked in pushing Freding into the startosphere 4D|pg||
pc|sK|nt|tomi2:  trump lead|pg||
