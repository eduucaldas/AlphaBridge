nt|brolucius: I wonder if South's pass of 1@C will eventually allow declarer to drop the @SK offside.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: hello Peter, Gerben, Ugis and Barnet|pg||
nt|ugis: Latvians playing Precision here and Polish club in the other room|pg||
nt|petergill: An untidy contract to reach|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 2@C must have been some art. rebid|pg||
nt|gulyas: this a good day so far for Hungary, scoring 29 and trying to climb back to contention|pg||
nt|hedyg: hi guys :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hi andy, spectators|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Bas|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  Wilkinson-Piper play a fairly standard version of Precision, in a typically aggressive style|pg||
nt|hedyg: the official website is : http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/10Ostend/Information.htm|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|bagman: Hi all|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Yes, set and ready to go|pg||
nt|mamos: good afternoon from England|pg||
nt|barnets: hi all|pg||
nt|ugis: yes, 2c artificial here|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Welcome Barnet :)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: so looks like a Burn's law violation|pg||
nt|Gerben42: (opps have more trumps than declarer)|pg||
nt|petergill: NS Convention Card is http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/May/OpenTeams/latvia/Ozols-Romanovskis.pdf|pg||
nt|Gerben42: probably not much lost as natural bidders would reach 3@C, which has problems on this trump break|pg||
pc|dK|nt|andyv:  dbl here by W should deny 4 spades. so E might be better to bid the @d suit|pg||
nt|xenya: and Martin |pg||
nt|bagman: Here NS are lucky to make 4@H|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Hey Mike, Shirley :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: canape sequesnce it seems |pg||
nt|mamos: yes ew stong club canape |pg||
nt|mamos: english pair 4 card majors natural style|pg||
nt|iain sime: Hi everyone. Both pairs are using fairly natural methods. For Italy 2@Dis strong, for the Swiss it is a weak 2.|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: As is Ostend :) Hey Iain|pg||
nt|hedyg: Polish @c for EW|pg||
nt|gulyas: a win here may still help them get in the top9|pg||
nt|athene: standard for NS|pg||
nt|athene: (strong and 5)|pg||
nt|gulyas: EW plays polish club|pg||
nt|bagman: Looks like strong club opening and two suited 2NT or misunderstanding|pg||
nt|koksoy: it  may be  lead directing purpose..|pg||
nt|schtsch: tesla stanicic are not in good shape on this tournament, but now is the time to correct it|pg||
nt|frululu: good result for Croatia in open room|pg||
nt|schtsch: well, we need 25 in this match to have a chance :)|pg||
nt|corplaw: EW can make 4H so possible double game swing available|pg||
nt|schtsch: so this is necessary|pg||
nt|frululu: and Latvia,Hungary and Wales need to be hitted by a bus :P|pg||
nt|drorp: 4@S makeable, needs good guessing though.|pg||
pc|d3|nt|othered1: Slightly pushy game, but preempt improves it.|pg||
nt|ziff:  I met him a couple of years ago at an EBL TD course|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: greetings everyone|pg||
pc|d8|nt|kiwi_joker: Madala in a comon position for us all .. not want to sell out to 2@S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hello Shirley, Bill and Mike|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hope you are all ungagged|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Heya Mike, Bill|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: And Roland :)|pg||

nt|Walddk2: And hello to Bas too|pg||
nt|bagman: or actually 5@H|pg||
nt|lesniak: witam wszystkich|pg||
nt|ugis: 2h showed h+c, min, S has forgotten the system :)|pg||
nt|athene: both pairs upside down carding|pg||
nt|petergill: A quiet hand to start|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This will be a stern test for Lithuania ... no joy on board 1, although 4@H is a fairly normal contract|pg||
nt|sybarra: everything off side here,  |pg||
nt|rnmalik: anyways de Wijs opted not to bid a misfit.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|xenya: @Hs rightsided|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Hey all, welcome back :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hello Pekka and Ben|pg||
nt|bagman: North has a very unfitting hand for South. 3NT might have made but the bad diamond break probably kills even that|pg||
nt|pasker: Hi everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and Andy|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Heya Ben|pg||
nt|brolucius: The 2@C overcall has helped them to stop low on good values.|pg||
nt|iain sime: Even hot in Edinburgh!|pg||
nt|brolucius: 12 winners (a requirement for a slam) but 2 losers (a negative slam feature).|pg||
nt|ni hao: salut|pg||

nt|Walddk2: You forgot to add the seniors, Bas. Here is the complete new macro|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: Hey Andy, Martin|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I guess NS don't play Gametry Doubles?|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|atabey: even w/o preemt normal to reach|pg||
nt|fabsayc: a fair bit of upgrading, this should make|pg||
nt|bagman: North would like to cash a spade and return a trump|pg||
nt|andyv:  some work to do here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hi Roland|pg||
nt|drorp: Very aggressive bidding from Versace, but the layout is lucky, will need to guess the spade situation to make.|pg||
pc|dA|nt|andyv:  should be an easy down 2|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 9 tricks in @S for EW because of good @S and @D splits, I think|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Bas:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  but 4th @d should allow declarer to pitch a @s|pg||
nt|athene: he will know the @SA is with north|pg||
nt|athene: for the opening bid|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: yes, but not a contract that was ever likley to be doubled|pg||
nt|andyv:  1st board partials tend to get away with murder... no one is ready to commit 11 or more imps:)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Italians must play that 3@D is weaker than a pass on the East cards.|pg||
nt|mamos: The English pair very experienced of course  - winners in Worls Seniors|pg||
nt|sybarra: nice lead to take the entry out of dummy fast |pg||
nt|barnets: e/w do quite well in diamonds|pg||
pc|cA|nt|xenya: played by S. it goes down on a @D lead|pg||
nt|sharkey: Will need to drop @SK to make|pg||
nt|bagman: South should IMO raised to 3@C instead of the 2nd pass|pg||
nt|lesniak: liczymy na lepszy wystep naszych|pg||
nt|bagman: Without X, this might be relatively cheap|pg||
nt|andyv:  the Italians are so good, they merely sent East and West to play for them.|pg||
nt|andyv:  not a bad pair here either|pg||
nt|corplaw: needs to avoid spade lead|pg||
pc|cT|nt|antoniz: bilans sto³u zosta³ zgubiony,trudno|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Roland, Pekka, Ben and everyone:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  and anti-percentage slam to start with|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Hey Andy|pg||
nt|pasker: Yes always relieving to see game going down as well if you are not doubled|pg||
nt|schtsch: ok, this is a plus score|pg||
nt|schtsch: but let's see how much|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hello Gary and Venky|pg||
nt|athene: but he might play north for @SAQx perhaps|pg||
pc|s2|nt|henryb:  It looks like declarer should take 2@s, 1@h, and two in each minor|pg||
nt|paulg:  Wilkinson-Piper also play very fast, so this should be a quick set|pg||
nt|drorp: Yes, knows the 3 aces are with north, but he can still have room for Q@S|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3@C would have made life a bit more difficult for West.|pg||
nt|hedyg: S needed 6+ hcps to bid over 1@c|pg||
nt|bagman: If E gets into the elimination position he can afford to finesse in spades to endplay N;|pg||
nt|hedyg: hard to read 9@c lead|pg||
nt|sharkey: S needs to shift to @H else @S finesse will protect @HK and will make|pg||

nt|athene: still a guess...yes he is likely to go wrong|pg||
nt|drorp: and the rush to take the A@H aswell might imply he's waiting for a trump trick|pg||
nt|athene: if you lead towards a KJx combination and second hand flies the ace, it's usually because he has AQx |pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: The URL is in my profile as well|pg||
nt|bjacobs: In 6@C, if you can avoid the heart lead, you can even lose the club finesse and maybe make.  As it turns out, there are other issues involved|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/10Ostend/Ostend|pg||
nt|bjacobs: In fact, 6@C on this layout will make on a heart lead!|pg||

nt|capercliff: Bas, tell him they are down by 3 goals already!:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Better to not go than to go like the French|pg||
nt|jbgood: 2 @d normally at least invitational in clubs|pg||
nt|bagman: I used to play Romex in 1981, then the opening was called Mexican 2@D (bal about this strength)|pg||
nt|stc: and, once ops are fixed on @s, 3NT is an easy make|pg||
nt|brolucius: West should have every reason to be nervous about this auction - having not shown his values at all.|pg||
nt|hedyg: how many times can you pass with 10 hcps opposite an opening?|pg||
nt|iain sime: 3NT would have made in practice.|pg||
nt|Gerben42: both hands 4333... should be in 3N|pg||

nt|andyv:  EW able to bully NS out of this auction.|pg||

nt|babs59: I meant for NS|pg||
nt|athene: interesting that versace goes very quietly indeed with his nice 15 count|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt isn't so bad, is it?|pg||
pc|d2|nt|kiwi_joker: If he had enough entries, he could lead spades from dummy 3 times for a very positive outcome (West covering first two times) .....|pg||
nt|andyv:  the 4 of @s just too big a card to overcome|pg||
nt|barnets: well done|pg||
nt|koksoy: as diamonds are 2-2  contract  depends on  heart guess|pg||
nt|petergill: Sorry we cannot explain what the bids mean|pg||
nt|ziff:  Versace will surely try for slam, but the 5-level should be safe, as a @D ruff is with the natural trump trick|pg||
nt|schtsch: ok, a push|pg||

nt|rv: I would X 3@D as game try if @DA was elsewhere|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|xenya: good stop, good lead|pg||
nt|bagman: E has soft values but he has so much of them that he has to at least invite|pg||
nt|brolucius: A recent book recommended a 5-4-3-2-1 point count (5 for aces, 1 for tens) when responding to 1NT. That would upgrade the value of the East hand.|pg||
nt|hedyg: no they dont open 1NT with 5 card majors|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I can't hear what they're saying exactly, but it's not Puppet I believe|pg||
nt|hedyg: i think 2@d denies 3 + cards in @H|pg||
nt|bagman: West has a good hand: aces and kings and the only Q in the suit where it surely works|pg||
nt|antoniz: kontra w 2pik powinna pokazywaæ lepsz¹ rêkê,moim zdaniem|pg||
nt|gulyas: EW lead 2nd/4th|pg||
nt|athene: can't see declarer finessing the six of trumps so this will lose two clubs, three trumps...maybe he will finesse spades too for a heart pitch|pg||
nt|athene: unless east gets endplayed somehow|pg||
nt|wstuart: probably shows any min?|pg||
nt|athene: i guess versace can anticipate that south will be able to hold up a diamond card and just kill the dummy|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|mamos: NS play 4 card majors|pg||
nt|marlowepi: presumably will rise and play a spade|pg||
nt|hedyg: or he will ruff out Q@s maybe?|pg||
nt|andyv:  should make this|pg||
pc|d3|nt|jtr: Looks like 9 tricks or so with the lie of the cards|pg||
nt|atabey: zorlu will have to guess @hs|pg||
nt|othered1: Personally, I'm not big on semi-psychic openings and would prefer to have some defense if I open.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Or "can" make|pg||
nt|mbruun: Good save by the Italians. East unstopable after the thin overcall|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Anyway, 5@S doubled is a pretty normal outcome|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Esp with @S, the Italians like to come in at the 1 level|pg||
nt|mdgraham: EW basically natural with a srong NT. NS play the NASZ system|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i predict down one|pg||
nt|corplaw: 4H could be down if declarer misguesses everything and def gives no help|pg||
pc|h4|nt|jtr: However, 8 might not be so easy:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: but nothing in their CC|pg||
nt|bagman: About 25 yars later it has been resurrected|pg||
nt|lesniak: oczywiscie jego istotnoæ polega na tym ,¿e wynik tego meczu bedzie sie liczy w finale|pg||
nt|bagman: The heart guess is getting no easier|pg||
nt|bagman: because S needs @HA for his opening more or less|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|athene: finesse must be better odds surely|pg||
nt|hedyg: a 3rd seat minor preempt is not necessarily weak|pg||
nt|athene: trump switch now would not help the defence, of course|pg||
nt|ziff:  I suspect 2@C was an artificial gameforce, 2@D may be balanced or nor @H support|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@C likely a general GF, perhaps 2@D = not three hearts. Just guessing though|pg||
nt|petergill: EW quickly established that slam was poor. The 2@D response to 2@C looks like it showed a minimum hand |pg||
nt|ziff:  Great minds all think alike ;)|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@C asked, 2@D = not 3@H, 2@S GF natural, 2NT minimum balanced, 4@S = end|pg||
nt|petergill: from my Italian source|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|koksoy: ým  sure D uboin will decide good after @S A @SD in N hand|pg||
pc|d6|nt|sybarra: bid 1 looks like severe punishment |pg||
nt|hedyg: so he either has 4@ss or no major|pg||
nt|petergill: The bidding makes picking the @D's fairly easy|pg||
nt|andyv:  don't see how... 5@hs, 2@s and at least 1@c|pg||
nt|schtsch: don't think 3@c can be minimum|pg||
nt|schtsch: how do they play 3@h then?|pg||
nt|schtsch: 3@h is obviously minimum, 3@c some relayish|pg||
nt|ahri: 3@c could ask which option it is if 2NT is what Bas suggests. I'll take a peek in their CC.|pg||
pc|h8|nt|Walddk2: Good morning to David Bird|pg||
nt|brolucius: Hi to the kibitzers!|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: Heya David B :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: The proposed new point-count system had two big flaws, as I see it. (1) No-one wants to have a 60-point deck and to need 34 points to open 2@C. Too difficult to count that high. ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: Also, you don;t know whether you will end in NT during the early bidding, so impractical to upgrade the Q/Js, which will have less value in an eventual suit contract.  |pg||

nt|sybarra: little frisky agst the Italians in the other room maybe|pg||
nt|athene: that's interesting shot - playing his partner for the ace of spades, hoping for @SA and another, and now declarer would duck, fearing the switch was a singleton|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 3@h shows a stiff @D|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3@D+2@S=5 I can only see 5 tricks for the defense. 2@S also when @H is played by E after 3 rounds of @D. The key card is the Q@C.|pg||

nt|mdgraham: well, 4@H was mildly unlucky|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I like the 2@C overcall, but West's raise to 3@C was more dubious.  Whatever, the Italians had booked a gain by stopping in a partscore|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but there is a question of whether 2@H in the actual sequence is (a) sign-off (b) invitational (c) forcing|pg||
nt|barnets: it would certainly have been more interesting to watch peter|pg||
nt|Gerben42: not so clear at this vuln to prefer defending|pg||

nt|wstuart: Somewhat pointless to guess at their methods.|pg||
nt|april7: now @S switch|pg||
pc|sA|nt|marlowepi: had trumps been 4-1 the second heart would have ben fatal, but there would have been chances by leading a spade|pg||
nt|brolucius: Possible intra-finesse in clubs.|pg||
nt|gulyas: it was not a bad idea, it was just wrong here|pg||
nt|athene: ok, one down|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer is likely to draw trumps now|pg||
pc|s3|nt|bjacobs: Most would play (a) ... but North might raise anyway.  The 4@H bid seemed to be "a lot"|pg||
pc|s7|nt|brolucius: Yes, some ******* has stolen my address book and is sending adverts that seem to come from me.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: for example, you can play 2@H as invitational and 2@C as a puppet to 2@d, so that 2@H is then pass/correct |pg||

pc|s2|pc|s3|nt|iceblue: ÏÖÔÚ¶Ô¸¶¶à¹¦ÄÜ 2@D µÄÎäÆ÷ºÜ³ÉÊì|pg||

nt|brolucius: Yes, looks like he needed one on that distribution.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I have a web address for the NASZ system, translated by Google. Here is an example:  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: The old volunteer for the color you submitted the high jump at ¶ 3 is invitational to you |pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: A Moysian (fit), for those who don't know, is a 4-3 fit named after the advocate of raising a 4cM opening with 3cM|pg||
nt|mamos: well  no very exciting|pg||
nt|drorp: 2@S appears to have 4-5 losers, 2 spades at most, a diamond and 2 clubs at most, so he will make it, maybe 9 tricks if taking a correct view in clubs|pg||
nt|athene: lauria trying to stop a heart ruff i suppose|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Vugraphznk: That sounds dirty Mike :)|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|gulyas: first blood to Italy for the extra down in 3@D bd2|pg||
nt|ziff:  I d rather emphasize @Cs than 432 in @H|pg||
pc|d4|nt|bagman: Now declarer can take the 3rd spade in dummy and take a club finesse for the contract|pg||
nt|koksoy: by  this  way , he can afford to  loose  2 hearts and a spade|pg||
pc|dK|nt|iceblue: 3@H ¸ãÏÞÆÆÌ×|pg||
nt|brolucius: With hearts not being 3-2, he seems to be a trick short.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's quite a charming translation|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 1 up with the @H finesse?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: But cashing out is probably better in Teams|pg||
pc|dA|nt|marlowepi: doesnt even need it as cards lie. could just cash winners and exit in clubs|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|pasker: Declarer likely to play for trumps 2-2 as has an extra chance if 3-1 of setting up @Ds for a 2nd @C pitch|pg||
nt|bagman: He should have gone up the @SA to have late entry to hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  E has easy exits|pg||
nt|athene: but now declarer can change tack and play the clubs|pg||
nt|drorp: maybe some sort of trump coup possible, double dummy i think even 10 tricks are possible|pg||
nt|athene: this is a common dilemma for the defence - if you play trumps, declarer uses a side suit|pg||
nt|drorp: A@H, A@D, @D ruff, @H ruff, @C to T, and K@C|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|daman: this will be over quickly|pg||
nt|gulyas: hmm, interesting play here|pg||
nt|athene: @S10 and declarer will throw @D perhaps|pg||
nt|gulyas: could be|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
pc|d6|nt|Vugraphznk: Hey George btw, and thanks :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Anyway, declarer will play the overcaller for the @HA.|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: True, but the @H finesse is more elegant :)|pg||
nt|athene: you normally hope that an early ruff is from the trump length|pg||
nt|athene: when it isn't, there can be problems|pg||
pc|c5|nt|Vugraphznk: N had the slightest of pauses before playing @DQ|pg||
nt|sybarra: may just play the !'s right now|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Here's another: For all the auctions bilateral spikes own color in a highly ³ ¶ you three and four are based on the fit ± colored partner (9 cards in the colors of bids) |pg||
nt|Walddk2: lol|pg||
nt|Walddk2: spikes|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: lol|pg||
nt|bjacobs: well, it's not exactly "full disclosure"|pg||
nt|sybarra: sounds like a volley ball game description |pg||
nt|bjacobs: Duboin really has a serious problem here - if that queen is singleton, which the odds suggest, he needs to cross to dummy to finesse diamonds|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I think I'll settle for the ECATS system document: available from http://www.ecatsbridge.com/Events/ebl/2010ostend/default.asp|pg||
nt|bjacobs: As it turns out, even if he does that, he will make, because then the 3-3 club break is revealed|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not every day i see someone say "the finesse is the more elegant line of play"|pg||
nt|athene: if declarer plays west for the @CJ|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|othered1: Again, open room reached the same contract after a different auction.   Good efforts to stop at 2|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So I think he might indeed take the club finesse now|pg||
nt|gulyas: @H now|pg||
nt|athene: apart from anything east may now be endplayed|pg||
nt|athene: of course we can see he isn't :)|pg||
nt|gulyas: true|pg||
nt|athene: when he switches to a heart, will declarer decide the @HK is wrong, and try to ruff it down?|pg||
nt|athene: ok, maybe he is considering a trump|pg||
nt|hedyg: when declarer refuses to play trump.........|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer can ruff the 4th club in dummy now|pg||
mc|8|nt|hedyg: @c ruff, draw trumps and run 9@H worked|pg||
nt|athene: with the spades wide open declarer can't get cute|pg||
nt|paulg:  he knows Piper has three or four hearts, and Wilkinson would not double with a singleton|pg||
nt|lesniak: oczywiscie Adam grajac 3 karo stara sie grac tylko najbezpieczniej jak mozna|pg||

nt|athene: but hard to know that really from south's point of view|pg||

nt|mdgraham: The Lithuanians let 5@D play on board 2 - likely afraid of pushing NS into a making slam - but 11 more to Italy |pg||
nt|bjacobs: that would be highly unethical, imo|pg||
nt|mbruun: Just kidding|pg||

nt|mamos: ahhh   action|pg||
nt|mamos: ACTION|pg||
nt|brolucius: I see that it means that when responder continues with 2@S over the requested 2@H, this has a special meaning. (Some players use that as Baron, looking for a 4-4 minor-suit fit).|pg||

nt|athene: and declarer has to lead into him|pg||
nt|andyv:  defense was friendly to declarer|pg||
nt|andyv:  can make 5@c here|pg||
nt|petergill: North might have competed to 4@C|pg||
nt|wstuart: is Duboin or Bocchi in?|pg||
nt|april7: good defence holding NS to 8 tricks|pg||
nt|drorp: yep, good contract reached, possible swing there|pg||
nt|athene: north sort of held himself to 8 tricks a bit, but he didn't do anything ridiculous|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Declarer had a chance to make the hand after A@H.|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Lauria bid and made 3NT on Board 2, where we saw them pick up +120 in 2NT in this room.|pg||
nt|athene: EW play standard count, NS play upside down count|pg||
nt|athene: both pairs play strong notrump, 5-card majors|pg||

nt|bjacobs: ah|pg||

nt|Walddk2: He was not kidding when he threw me 19,81 meters down a slope 22 years ago|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Anyone for Michaels with that North hand?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: NO|pg||
nt|jbgood: trump lead not a big sucess that time|pg||

mb|1S|nt|andyv:  looks like 4@h or maybe 3N|pg||
mb|2D|nt|hedyg: there are no live results as yet so pls stop asking us|pg||
nt|athene: 2@S gives east a slightly awkward decision|pg||
nt|athene: 3@H is very committal on such a modest suit|pg||
nt|athene: so double is reasonable|pg||
nt|daman: he chose the lesser of 2 evils|pg||
nt|mbruun: Good suits|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am a michaels here,  I michaels on everything |pg||
nt|mdgraham: Include me out, as Sam Goldwyn once said|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think it's a terrible Michaels vulnerable|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Shirley, one of the very top players in my area agrees with you.  He thinks the only excuse for not coming in with a 5-5 is that you are dead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I have a mild aversion to going for unnecessary 1400 penalties|pg||
nt|jbgood: the setting trick would /might have come in clubs....|pg||
nt|rodvenn: can Italy get to 5 @c?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 35 IMPs in 3 boards, the Italians are avenging their honour, it seems|pg||

nt|stc: italy in 5@d on board 2|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he could have tried spade to 9 first|pg||
nt|andyv:  he did... he lost to 10|pg||
nt|fabsayc: when that loses to ten he switches to hearts on second entry|pg||
nt|andyv:  ah, ok|pg||
nt|andyv:  so before he touches @hs|pg||
nt|wstuart: but Madala is in this room?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|bjacobs: well, it's only mild ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 500 point save in 5@S|pg||
nt|bagman: NS have started by bidding quite aggressively. It's a reasonable strategy when being an underdog|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@C Precision|pg||
nt|snetram:  Holandia, Austria i Anglia|pg||
nt|drorp: Ultra agressive opening|pg||
mb|5D|nt|daman: bidding 3@H would be aiming at a very small target|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D alerted because it promises some values|pg||
nt|athene: (2nt would be rubbish)|pg||
nt|daman: he might try 3@H now|pg||
nt|athene: i think east should just pass|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not really worth it|pg||
nt|brolucius: Had West made a weak jump overcall of 2@S and the opponents then settled in 6@C, declarer might play East for the @HA.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Perhaps Slovakians were up all night celebrating.|pg||
nt|bagman: North has some options: 2@D, 2NT, 3@C and 3NT|pg||
nt|bagman: all depending on their agreements|pg||

nt|rv: pass by West denies 3@s, negative inference for no support X|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: wow Italy not only bid slam but grand on board 1 and made it|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: If you press the MOVIE button, you can see the entire scorecard and play through any of the deals at the other table.|pg||
nt|ugis: 1d looked strange :)|pg||
nt|babs59: yes - last hand's 5@D bid was only 1 trick stronger really|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: Transfer response|pg||
nt|jtr: 1@h showing specifically three cards i imagine|pg||
nt|brolucius: West's 1@H rebid suggests three-card heart support.|pg||
nt|andyv:  5 imps to Lebanon on board 3 as they bid 5@hx|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Yesterday Hedy advocated rebidding 2@S as opposed to 1NT on a hand similar to the current W hand because of @Hxx :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  aggressive dbl by Bocchi has put S in a quandry|pg||
nt|andyv:  3@c will probably end it|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Interesting options for Madala here ..he has best hand at table...hasnt said a word yet :) |pg||
nt|andyv:  right... that's the quandry|pg||
nt|bjacobs: so you might as well go for it|pg||
nt|sybarra: I figure, one bid gets this hand off my chest  |pg||
nt|xenya: quite sensible though|pg||
nt|rodvenn: pushed|pg||
nt|rodvenn: we dont know who thinks. probably charlsen|pg||
nt|Walddk2: When fixed stay fixed. Madala thinking about raising I suppose. I don't Charlsen is thinking|pg||
nt|rodvenn: the BBO operator probably cant see on the other side of the screen|pg||
nt|jbgood: my press colleagues here think it is Charlsen who is thinking|pg||
nt|hedyg: Lohay wondering how much his K@D is worth|pg||
nt|bagman: Personally I would have taken the more aggressive 2NT approach|pg||
nt|brolucius: In the open room there was no spade overcall at all, I am told, and declarer guessed the @HA. |pg||
nt|sharkey: On previous hand In OR Madala entered dummy to play @H towards his hand - like he knew E had Ax... - one trump loser only|pg||
nt|brolucius: I don't like 3@C much on those values. 2@D or 2NT looks better. |pg||
nt|sharkey: after @D lead|pg||
nt|bagman: South has a good hand and can see 7 quick tricks|pg||
nt|sharkey: agree David - about as good as he can get|pg||
nt|bagman: Partner can still have the diamond stopper and a trick|pg||

mb|p|nt|Vugraphznk: How about no bid?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I'm 18 and even I wouldn't Michaels it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But every time it's not your hand you have given the show away, and there is nothing that suggests that it *is* your hand with the values North has|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Nor any other immediate overcall|pg||

nt|ahri: EW are playing strong club system so 1@d is sort of catchall |pg||
nt|schtsch: they have discussion on 50% of the borads|pg||
pc|hK|nt|andyv:  only problem with NT... no tricks|pg||
nt|andyv:  S will scramble for 7 tricks|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: 2NT is so seldom natural these days .. have we found a rare example?  :-)|pg||
nt|andyv:  Bocchi trying to decide|pg||
nt|andyv:  Q10 of @s makes him doubt that it's natural|pg||
nt|andyv:  but his minors are pretty sick|pg||
nt|andyv:  passing will probably push the board|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: several kibs think 2NT = scramble|pg||
nt|mbruun: Dbl of a Michaels could be treated as 7+ with 3c support. 2NT or 3H GF with 4c support, and if you have a penalty double just pass 2 Sp and wack them in the next roundat tti|pg||
nt|mdgraham: values? Well, all those fours must be worth something|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: *Tries not to laugh*|pg||
nt|sybarra: no chuckling at the table Bas |pg||
nt|bjacobs: I would pass as well, but the fact is that 5-5's can be quite powerful.  And the opponents don't always nail you, even when they should|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Looks like a playable method, Mathias|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The problem might be if partner intervenes before you get your chance to double|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Where did you nick it?|pg||
nt|mbruun: From Duboin-Sementa|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Another possibility is to double the 2@S bid saying: "partner, I am interested in penalties"|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That might stop partner from making a bid before you can get your claws on the next hand's bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: if only he could get to dummy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: By the way, 2@C shows diamonds as you may have guessed|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: It was Charlsen thinking, Madala had a swift pass|pg||
nt|sybarra: now for the cue bidding|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I count 16 tricks in any contract but @S EW :)|pg||
nt|gulyas: I am happy with the outcome as I am biased, but still surprised at the play|pg||
nt|athene: 6@S is there, but unlikely to be bid|pg||
nt|athene: oh sorry only 11 tricks|pg||
nt|athene: but surely they won't get higher than 4@S |pg||
nt|bagman: EW can make only 8 tricks in hearts|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@C FG 4+@C or balanced|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 2@D is nf with @D|pg||
nt|drorp: i hope 3@C is NF|pg||
nt|drorp: trouble now|pg||
pc|h6|nt|sharkey: 2@D would also leave more room for bidding|pg||
nt|bagman: Hoping that the cards lay well|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hi Vassilis, welcome|pg||
nt|drorp: Barbosa wants to double 3@S :)|pg||
pc|h9|nt|brolucius: 2@D only shows a sound raise to 3@C, so North has plenty for that. Then he can raise to 3@C on distributional values and fewer points (to be obstructive).|pg||
nt|lesniak: lub skontruje 1 ba|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Hey Vassilis|pg||
nt|mamos: i think East has shown 4 controls so West may well be off to the grand |pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 clubs is?   |pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I wonder what 3@S would've been|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: OR bid 1@S p 4@S ap|pg||
nt|jkotor: impas karo jest bezpieczny|pg||
nt|babs59: oops|pg||
nt|drorp: he'll double 3NT too|pg||
nt|drorp: maybe even south can, holding a club stop|pg||
nt|athene: south should be close to doubling 3nt|pg||
nt|drorp: and good diamonds stops|pg||
nt|athene: north should have more than just spades, to double 3@S|pg||
nt|athene: if he only had four or five spade tricks and nothing else he would pass 3@S i am sure|pg||

nt|hedyg: he obviously devalued the K@d|pg||
nt|bagman: 3NT by N would have made only with diamond lead|pg||
nt|sharkey: cud go 2@D - 2@D - 3 NT|pg||
nt|brolucius: Then East might well lead a major suit.|pg||
nt|sharkey: The way this match is going - Yes|pg||

nt|brolucius: The bidding continues naturally after such a rebid?|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: lol at the Impage :)|pg||
nt|jtr: Useful to have all those @cs concealed|pg||
nt|brolucius: 6@S has been rescored as one down.|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: I can't imagine EW being in 6@S board 1|pg||
nt|brolucius: Justice!!|pg||
nt|jtr: Well, responder must have a way of forcing through a relay|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you can make game in clubs though:)|pg||
nt|petergill: Normal Precision bidding 1@C 16+, 2@D 5+ @D and 8+ HCP GF, 2@S 5+ @S|pg||
nt|gulyas: they play Szalay's relay precision|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@S - 5+@H one suiter or 4+ @C|pg||

nt|andyv:  I don't think Madala meant anything else than wanting to play 2N|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Bocchi opened the screen and they started discussing even before the lead :)|pg||
nt|rodvenn: claims|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: True|pg||
nt|babs59: last time I tried 3NT with 10xxx (and against 1@C better minor) I had the same problem|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@S also minimum |pg||
nt|petergill: 2NT asks|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: better not cover 10!|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|rv: now it will make since there won't an entry to North hand for @s ruff or @d gets pitched on @CK|pg||
nt|drorp: spade lead and heart switch seems like the best start|pg||
nt|athene: he might jump ace here to get the clubs going fast|pg||
nt|april7: ace and @C E might save some tricks|pg||
nt|athene: just a pity about the @CQ in the wrong place|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Good save as 4@S was making.|pg||
pc|h5|nt|jtr: I play 2@d asks opener to define their hand|pg||
nt|othered1: In other room west tried a simple raise, perhaps constructive.|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@H 11-14 6+ @H, not 3@C|pg||
pc|hA|nt|sybarra: now does N have stiff ace or q?|pg||
nt|hedyg: disc a @H|pg||
nt|babs59: West could have led 4th highest and smiled|pg||
nt|april7: has to duck 2 @H later|pg||
pc|h4|nt|kiwi_joker: When in, Fayad needs to play A@S .. but Madala has given him impression he could have Kx still left. Always good to put doubt in defenders' minds!|pg||
nt|hedyg: or a @s :)|pg||
nt|schtsch: well, 8:0 is a great start|pg||

nt|bjacobs: Duboin's comment breaches copyright, doesn't it?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: must have been irresistible|pg||
nt|rv: good stop by Swiss ladies here|pg||
nt|drorp: this can be a big number for NS, they can take 2 clubs 4 hearts and 1 spade, easily|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|athene: east should just count himself thankful that his partner bid diamonds rather than clubs|pg||
nt|mbruun: 11 tricks now. Spade entry for the diamonds |pg||
nt|brolucius: Bocchi bid 2NT on the North cards at the other table. If you put your cursor over the Open Room result, top-left, you can see the other auction. |pg||
nt|marlowepi: our mathematicians in the audience can tell us what the odds are, when you have 2 six card suits, that five of the cards will be the same in the two suits|pg||
nt|marlowepi: they must make astronomical look small|pg||
nt|sybarra: praying for 2/2 @D after @H's dont break or is there another way?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: with 43 club break do not even need to guess Ds or have good luck there|pg||
nt|mamos: yes i was thinking about 4-3 as always its about combining chances|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4 discrads on black suit winners|pg||
nt|mamos: whats the best order|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes I see the club 4/3  maybe easier |pg||
nt|sybarra: I am told 7 sp only 2000, but they you push them to 7 nt most likely |pg||
pc|d2|nt|jtr: @h raises show five cards (obviously) and are limit bids|pg||
nt|brolucius: With only 4 hearts and a rubbish hand, East has to sign off in 1NT, 2@C or 2@H?|pg||
nt|jtr: Others play the 1@h rebid as any weak hand which i think is inferior|pg||
nt|jtr: Right|pg||
nt|jtr: Anyway, how is he doing in 4@h?|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: He has to decide if it's KTx or K9x or K8 onside|pg||
nt|jtr: Not as simple as that is it?|pg||
nt|brolucius: North held off his king to give declarer a guess if he held Q-J-9-x-x, but he has given West a chance to pick up the trumps for no loser now.|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: @C aren't splitting so he should ruff a @C in dummy?|pg||
nt|jtr: North did very well not to cover|pg||
nt|pasker: declarer likely to be at least down 2 here, 2@S 2@H, 1@D, 1@C|pg||
nt|marlowepi: have to play trump ace first in case they are 4-0. then king of H, club to ace and club ruff, heart to Q and club ruff, claim|pg||
nt|mamos: you dont want to go off trying to set up Club when Diamonds 2-2 alll the time |pg||
nt|schtsch: for handball of course|pg||
pc|d5|nt|tez: it was 8/10|pg||
nt|andyv:  even with fancy foot work in @s suit, there still are only 7 tricks|pg||
nt|hedyg: claim|pg||
nt|gulyas: Szalay, easily the best player of the team (and probably of Hungary, too, some may say) is a rare sitout|pg||
nt|athene: declarer will probably try to ruff hearts in dummy|pg||
nt|hedyg: i thought Dumbovich was the best on the team|pg||
nt|gulyas: he is expected to play the rest of the matches|pg||
nt|bagman: South might be worried about the result as some might open the N hand and reaching game is then easier|pg||
nt|andyv:  there's no humor in bridge|pg||
nt|andyv:  :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: That wasn't actually a slow duck by Norh|pg||
nt|athene: they aren't getting four hearts |pg||
nt|april7: if N would have taken the ace|pg||
nt|drorp: not rising with @CA is bad, now probably 2 down at most|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: North even|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|mbruun: Made it easy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Note that Bocchi passed over 1@S at the other table|pg||
nt|snetram:  jestem zwolennikiem teorii Jacka PszczoÅy, Å¼e z dwoma starszymi czwÃ³rkami zawsze daje siÄ Staymana. OczywiÅcie o ile z dwoma starszymi czwÃ³rkami odpowiada siÄ 2 kier.|pg||
nt|drorp: heart is crucial now|pg||
nt|athene: there is an interesting point of strategy here, whether you should lead dummy's suit on these auctions|pg||
nt|april7: wrong pick so 1 down only|pg||
nt|athene: just because partner has the spades held doesn't mean you necessarily are best off leading them at trick 1|pg||
nt|drorp: well now declearer suddenly has 8 tricks, and a disaster board turns to be a normal score|pg||
nt|athene: ok, it is likely to be safe, but not much more|pg||

pc|dA|nt|Vugraphznk: E has already showed @D2 now :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: and the friendly opp led a small @d|pg||
nt|bagman: Now declarer has 9 tricks as he's going to lose a heart; claim time|pg||
nt|brolucius: A kibitzer asks if 46-0 is a record after four boards. Only the all-seeing Great Dealer can answer that.|pg||
nt|hedyg: and Roland?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, sorry, I forgot. Him and Roland.|pg||
nt|bagman: The defense needs to cash out now|pg||
pc|s3|nt|vugraphznk: Not anymore :)|pg||
nt|jtr: I guess he will cash the @hA and hope a few @cs stand up|pg||
nt|jtr: Will get a subsidiary bonus|pg||
nt|athene: useful @D7 :)|pg||
nt|daman: losing 2@Ds   claim|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: @D7 is always a good card :)|pg||
nt|athene: duck this trick looks simplest|pg||
nt|hedyg: LOL|pg||
nt|bagman: Lauria's 2NT was a bit aggressive with that bad shape and questionable values in the form of 2x Jxx|pg||

nt|daman: making 4 actually|pg||
nt|athene: heart lead and declarer was in a world of hurt|pg||
pc|s9|nt|drorp: when your other option is J7432 - i think leading spade was the normal choice, heart can give away alot with this holding|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|sT|nt|iceblue: ÊÂÊµÉÏ 2@H dbl ¹À¼Æ×îÉÙ800·Ö¡£|pg||
nt|hedyg: oh its ok, we dont have to agree|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|paulg:  @h2 probably shows an even number of hearts, which should help Lauria|pg||
nt|hedyg: Lauria needs to disc the 8@c|pg||
nt|mamos: so does require some thought|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 43 clubs better odds, though much closer if you add the winning-guess cases for 31 Ds|pg||

nt|sybarra: stiff q would have been interesting with N |pg||
nt|Walddk2: But the finesse is with the odds as it also caters to AQx onside|pg||
nt|mdgraham: declarer got a diamond lead and club switch. Misguessed trumps|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: A two-suited overcall would've been less likely with @SQ- I think|pg||

nt|Walddk2: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/Events/ebl/2010ostend/default.asp  for convention cards and other useful information|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Bocchi had shuffled, put his cards back in, taken a new board, placed the tray and board on the table and took out his cards before EW knew what had happened|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's not a record|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Obermair inquiring about the @D, laughter all around|pg||
nt|brolucius: Playing a two-level response as game-forcing has some advantages, of course. If it didn't, most of the USA wold not use it. But it is not that wonderful. Here, for example, East ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: did not want to cue-bid the @CA (because he wanted to limit his hand) but West was still unlimited.  |pg||
nt|barnets: another 6 imps to latvia when italy reached 4@S|pg||
nt|barnets: on the last|pg||
nt|gulyas: sure, some would say Dumbovich, or Winkler is better, its open to discussion:)|pg||
nt|athene: he had a heart-club squeeze even if east had long clubs|pg||

nt|hedyg: not this time..|pg||
nt|athene: another boring 4major+1 push :) so this discussion can go on |pg||
nt|gulyas: he opted not to play due to personal reasons and work|pg||
nt|hedyg: tough decision|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Interesting: would you try for slam with the S hand opposite a strong 1NT?|pg||
nt|gulyas: but he WAS asked:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: :) of course he was!|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: The board has been put in the wrong way around...|pg||
nt|koksoy: double  difference & one overtrick  is 7 imps  for  Wales |pg||
nt|koksoy: at the  3rd board|pg||
nt|babs59: a reasonable shot by South tho|pg||
nt|petergill: After 16 rounds, EW, who play in all Italy's toughest matches and sat out matches like Slovakia, Latvia and Wales, are +0.46 imps/bd for 11 matches played |pg||
nt|april7: luckyn outcome though|pg||
nt|athene: maybe lauria has been taking lessons from Phil Hellmuth - he too can dodge bullets :)|pg||
nt|drorp: E-W really lucked out here, bidding game with 11 to 9 and a misfit, might still cost them as a normal 3@C contract probably makes|pg||

mb|1D!|nt|hedyg: ty Roland :)|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Vugraphznk: In their defence, it was a really quick one|pg||
nt|xenya: Bocchi didn't know 5@C was making but he felt he had to take an insurance in any case|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 55 is|pg||
nt|brolucius: Perhaps Roland is the Great Dealer.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: some of the laughter may be about something else:)|pg||
nt|stc: 5@d was made because the def helped dec to eliminate @h@S, and dec guessed the @c position|pg||
nt|brolucius: In other words, it is difficult for both players to combine getting their strength across and cue-bidding their controls.|pg||
nt|gulyas: its a very nice hand|pg||
nt|athene: you have to be confident to bid 4@H with that south hands|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Or 4@D, if you play SA Texas, I guess :)|pg||
nt|athene: i remember lauria-versace had a misunderstanding in that position in the bermuda bowl|pg||
nt|babs59: and unfortunate that East gets horribly squeezed in 5@C|pg||
nt|babs59: on board 2 the Italians found the 5@C vulnerable save, but EW bid on to 5@S making|pg||
nt|andyv:  S still wondering what to do with her 2 headed monster|pg||
nt|mdgraham: anybody watching who is Welsh may not be too amused at that, Peter :) |pg||
nt|petergill: The favourable vulnerability led Lauria to choose the more aggressive overcall|pg||

nt|athene: if the defence don't get their heart in the bag declarer might throw it on a club, making 12 |pg||

nt|babs59: not what I'd have predicted|pg||
nt|drorp: still need to reach the game, south has a rather ugly 10 count|pg||
mb|r|nt|brolucius: Now I think of it, 4@H was a bit of a pot on the East hand - with an unhelpful void in partner's first-bid suit. Still, overbidding is not a fault at this level.|pg||
nt|hedyg: a drop of blood, Bas corrected the score|pg||
nt|hedyg: now, now, lets not go overboard !|pg||
nt|athene: well 4@D is ok because partner knows it's something cute so will probably just bid 4@H|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: W is happy|pg||

nt|henryb:  you might try 3@s instead. That after all was the purpose of that bid|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Double = 4+ spades|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So on this auction 1@S shows the minors|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2NT relay|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@S seems to be a good spot to stop in|pg||
nt|gulyas: he knows N probably has wasted values in @H - unless he has the A|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: In Rubensohl (the way I play it), 3@H is 5+@S, so 3NT might just be SO or offer to play systematically|pg||
nt|gulyas: with a bad hand and no fit, you could still just bid 3@S|pg||
nt|athene: NS play 3@H is invitational+ so i assume with any minimum north just bids 3@S|pg||
nt|gulyas: now S may get excited|pg||
nt|athene: south might content himself with 4@H|pg||
nt|hedyg: scared to bid 4@H?|pg||
nt|april7: 3 down but possible 4 if ruff in @C isfound|pg||
nt|drorp: I think they will take it now|pg||
nt|drorp: defence is quite straight forward|pg||
mb|3C|nt|capercliff: 3@s was the ideal bid|pg||
nt|pasker: Do people agree with dble from N?|pg||
nt|lesniak: natomiast wychodzi 5 trefli|pg||
nt|jkotor: ale obrona wychodzi na trafieniu kiera|pg||

nt|petergill: unless he can find a 10th trick somehow|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  and my apologies... She missed a chance:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  should make 4|pg||

mb|p|nt|hedyg: pls David! you are born English, you cannot become English!|pg||
nt|brolucius: Several million have done.|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: You better, I wagered Netherlands - Germany as finals (3-2, of course)|pg||
nt|bagman: Here declarer needs lot of luck to make|pg||
nt|andyv:  this may get expensive|pg||
nt|andyv:  bad trump split and immediate taps|pg||
nt|ahri: on a rounded suit lead you need 4-3 diamonds to throw that other loser, and if finesse of spades won't work you need west not to have fourth diamond|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Good morning everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk4: And welcome to David Bird and Jack Zhao|pg||
nt|jtr: N/S cc on http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/May/OpenTeams/italy/bocchi-madala.pdf|pg||
nt|jtr: for those that are interested|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Also available for those who are not|pg||
nt|Walddk2: :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: I have a Bocchi0Duboin convention card up and 1@S shows diamonds for that partnership. Cannot find one for this partnership.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Oh, I see now that David has found one. That's good.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: two aces + @DQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: South thinks North has shown 5-5 is my quess|pg||
nt|mbruun: South seems to think that partner promised 55|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I assume they have a strong club base, hence the 3@D, and the small misunderstanding|pg||
nt|mbruun: Sry slow typing by me|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Lots of whispering on both sides|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's a really tough hand to bid, to be honest|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@C is 12-14/19-23 balanced, or natural|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Then I don't understand 3@D at all ...|pg||
nt|paulg:  so you play in 3N opposite the @sA and lose the first five clubs with 5@d cold?|pg||
nt|andyv:  no, gives too much info away and hand isn't distributional enough|pg||
nt|bagman: I would not X myself but I admire the courage of those who do X|pg||
nt|hedyg: (as my English husband used to tell me )|pg||
nt|hedyg: they become British, never English|pg||
nt|gulyas: he is not sure where that would take him|pg||
nt|gulyas: 5@S or 6@S now?|pg||
nt|hedyg: so what is 5@C now? fit or cue?|pg||
nt|jkotor: czyli tutaj wynik bardzo wiele znaczy|pg||
nt|bagman: The club lead gives 8th trick|pg||
nt|koksoy: after club  lead..  Sementha  has 8 tricks..  and  will  try  for  jay  jay  squeze|pg||
nt|petergill: North played South for @DJ rather than @DK|pg||
nt|petergill: Find an 11th trick somewhere, I mean|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I'm being told that on board 4 (3NT X-1) Bocchi sits North, declaring 2@SX|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|jtr: The ecats site is more useful that the tournament site|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is the only slam that does not make. I think 6@C, 6@H, 6@S and 6NT all make|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 6@H?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Oh well, hearts 6-1|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But it's a better contract than 6@D|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Indeed, in fact, I think it's probably the correct contract IN THEORY|pg||
nt|bjacobs: No, perhaps 6@C|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, good luck, North|pg||
nt|mdgraham: guess well|pg||
nt|brolucius: Chance of a slam is not wonderfulo, after the single raise, but typically the Italians will take a look in that direction.|pg||
nt|bagman: Maybe W relayed to see if E had 4-5-1-3|pg||
nt|vasmar: vulnerable no|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't think many do, Ben|pg||
nt|stc: the two black Q's in S will probably score|pg||
nt|lesniak: w pewnym momencie rozgrywajacy bedzie musial trafic czy N ma AKDxxx, Kxx, xxxx, czy aktualna reke|pg||
pc|sK|nt|atabey: thats a surprise. salvo(assael) playes 2@d natural normally. |pg||
nt|tez: first partscore swing i think|pg||
nt|hedyg: E denied a singleton i guess|pg||
nt|bagman: Then there might be a legitimate slam|pg||
nt|barnets: the 12 imps Iatvia gained is when after a natural 2N - North Bocchi looked for a major fit with 4-3-3-3 found one and went down|pg||
nt|athene: ok, going to the 5-level is a very serious statement and duboin will now surely bid the slam|pg||
nt|athene: wow, he didn't, even with all the trumps|pg||
nt|gulyas: interesting|pg||
nt|athene: i guess his rationale is, if north had everything needed he would just bid blackwood himself|pg||
nt|petergill: Could have played @HA, ruff 2 hearts ...|pg||
nt|cumino: On @D lead she could make|pg||
nt|rv: West should have been a bit circumspect after South showed 10+cards in red suits and with void in partner's pre-empt suit|pg||
pc|s6|nt|Walddk4: Also welcome to Alwyn Jihe|pg||
nt|andyv:  ok, we can get rid of the 3N bidders...Bob's law about 3N was true on this hand.|pg||
nt|rodvenn: an alternative for Charlsen was to double the 1@s bid. but that is not where his honours are|pg||
nt|rodvenn: then Hofta probably would have gone on to game.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Ah.|pg||
nt|andyv:  so the 1@d showd 4+@hs and 3@d completed S's pattern|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|jtr: Best lead|pg||
nt|jtr: He wil just cash the other @d and play @cs i imagine|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am told this gives the scores:  for running scores: http://eurobridge.org/competitions/runningscores/asp/roundteamsconditstatclassicmod.asp?qtournid=819&qshowflag=1|pg||
nt|hedyg: anybody bid 1@s with the N hand not being able to able to bid 2@D?|pg||
nt|andyv:  S has some choices... run 3 @cs and pitch 2@h and try to ruff the hand out|pg||
nt|andyv:  N was doing well with her passes|pg||
pc|d7|nt|brolucius: Yes, but East would then still need a bundle of good cards in the majors.|pg||
nt|snetram:  dobra decyzja, jak na wysokosci pieciu to w trefle, ale 5 kierÃ³w po pikowym wygrywaÅo siÄ z bezradnoÅci|pg||

nt|lesniak: wlasnie, albo Kx albo kxx albo k10x|pg||
nt|petergill: Can still, as North has not removed a dummy entry|pg||
nt|rv: I expect this to go 1 down since too much work to be done|pg||
pc|d2|nt|bagman: It might win a partscore but often it gives away info or induces partner to overcompete|pg||
nt|sybarra: does he play ace and spade now?|pg||
nt|brolucius: West limited his hand by not doubling 2NT (which showed a weak diamond raise). East did not have a clear-cut leap to 4@S over the delayed double.|pg||
nt|athene: hmmm ok a wheel has come off here|pg||
nt|hedyg: i dont see that N ever showed @s fit|pg||
nt|athene: if 3nt showed better than minimum, north should back-pedal all the way after that|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: N looks puzzled|pg||
nt|athene: since he has really a bad hand|pg||
nt|gulyas: N bid 5NT to pick a slam I guess|pg||
nt|athene: if north is looking puzzled now,  i would suspect that he thought south had hearts|pg||
nt|hedyg: seems like he was protecting K@H all the way|pg||
nt|athene: but then 3nt makes no sense because he has no spade stop|pg||
nt|gulyas: I think he should have bid 4@S over 4@H|pg||
nt|athene: yes, 5@C was definitely an overbid|pg||
nt|athene: if the auction all means what we think it does|pg||
nt|gulyas: @S stop? 3@H showed @Ss|pg||
nt|athene: but i think there are probably three interpretations of this auction here - north's, south's, and ours :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: where is the undo button?|pg||
nt|gulyas: :)|pg||
nt|athene: maybe four - North's, South's, ours, and the right one|pg||
nt|gulyas: I like where this is going, sry Italians:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Sementa: "I think this is a misunderstanding"|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|iain sime: Meanwhile, East has done too much opposite a balancing double I think. Oh, and come on Germany!|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|gulyas: we need all the imps we can get our hands on|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Italian going on now|pg||
pc|s7|nt|hedyg: i dont like 1NT with xx in @H|pg||
nt|pasker: S could have returned a @S for ruff here at trick 2|pg||

nt|babs59: maybe she thought the 4@D bid showed some 6-6|pg||
nt|babs59: after all, the 4@H bid had given a reprieve|pg||
nt|petergill: East can make, if he can see all the cards. |pg||
pc|s3|nt|jtr: Oh well done!|pg||
nt|andyv:  ducking probably not a winner but Madala is unaware of the bad splits|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: I dont think it can make now, can it Andy?|pg||
nt|andyv:  i don't think so|pg||
nt|andyv:  can't ruff 2@cs and still pick up the @d suit... and he still has a @s to lose|pg||
nt|andyv:  if either minor behaved this would be a quick claimer|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Had to win first trick and play three top clubs, methinks|pg||
nt|paulg:  Versace may block the clubs here to get a heart through|pg||
nt|Walddk2: However, I also admire some imagination when you know that your opponents are much better players|pg||
nt|petergill: At the other table, North opened 1@S, East passed (sensible and disciplined) and Madala as South has responded 1NT, which could lead to a @D partscore, I guess|pg||
nt|Gerben42: the maximum for an Italian 1@S is quite high, still not passing was a position|pg||
nt|petergill: Actually, Lauria did well not to play hearts too early, else North would have been able to beat him|pg||
pc|s8|nt|andyv:  I think so|pg||
pc|sA|pg||

pc|d3|nt|capercliff: with just the A@s N doesnt have to bid 3N|pg||
nt|bagman: Sure but AQxx Kxxxx x Kxx gives some play, I think|pg||
nt|andyv:  the plus side is that both NS are original passers so they shouldn't get carried away by overbidding|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No offence intended of course|pg||
nt|andyv:  maybe... although dbl would seem indicated if that were the case|pg||
nt|petergill: East knows from Trick 1 that South has @DK and N has @DQ, so he knows all the high card layout|pg||
pc|d9|nt|iceblue: morning, its 17:20 here :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  now the bad news|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it is by no means trivial to wind up in 3N, making while 4S fails|pg||
nt|bagman: S is not going to like discarding but there's not much he can do wrong really|pg||

nt|Walddk2: No matches at Wimbledon today I hear, that solves one problem|pg||

nt|andyv:  E should refuse to over ruff here|pg||
pc|c4|nt|petergill: so they have stopped in 3@D, which looks makeable|pg||

nt|fabsayc: well successful, pretty skinny|pg||
nt|schtsch: 8 tricks are there in 3nt|pg||
nt|toral5: routine 4@S here|pg||
nt|Walddk5: 12-15|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Nice looking 4@S for EW. All the prequisites of going overboard.|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: might have gone for 200 undoubled|pg||
nt|barnets: that proves troublesome|pg||
nt|ziff:  Another @C would not have worked, as N could have discarded a @S. Declarer would manage to establish a @S, but would not be able to enter his hand again to cash it|pg||
mb|4H!|nt|henryb:  I remind specs that I do not respond to queries from peope who do not have the courtesy to disclose their ful names on their peofile|pg||

nt|vasmar: 4@h be E easy|pg||
nt|andyv:  mini splinter?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I must say, NS don't seem to be intimidated at all... Not letting EW play they usually do, ask to see claims, etc.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: On board 3, Bocchi-Madala discovered the club weakness, but they are uncomfortably high in 5@H. It also got a spade lead|pg||
nt|mamos: i hadnt even thought about if it was making just expected to bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: pretty likely that S had Q@c|pg||
nt|brolucius: Double (competitive) can mean clubs and spade tolerance (usually a doubleton).|pg||
nt|Gerben42: with this @H stopper you need @C for 0 loser|pg||
nt|petergill: East hand is worth 20.05 HCP, according to Kand R Evaluator at http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=aq2+k64+k6+ak986|pg||
nt|mdgraham: mildly unlucky lead, that diamond |pg||
nt|rv: 3n superior to 4@h for NS though both contracts make|pg||
nt|drorp: Italians have been remarkebly aggressive so far|pg||
nt|april7: 2 or 3 @S by N??|pg||
nt|athene: 4@H+1 here i would guess|pg||
nt|athene: maybe it's NS's turn to sac|pg||
mb|p|nt|ryskiel_: a mo¿e w trefle?|pg||
nt|bagman: Here 4@H for EW looks fine|pg||
mb|4S|nt|jtr: 4@h failed on 4|pg||
nt|brolucius: Had Bocchi taken David's advice and cashed the second diamond winner, he would have made an overtrick.  |pg||
nt|jtr: I would usually defer to him:)|pg||
nt|brolucius: South scored a club overruff to defeat 4@H at the other table.|pg||
nt|tez: 2@d=good raise|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Adam Kaplan wrote a book on the "Tired RHO squeeze", applying here as well :)|pg||
nt|xenya: 5@D now -- can W or E bid 6 after that?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Madala would like to get doubled in a number of diamonds. Contemplating how to achieve that|pg||
nt|rodvenn: 6@dx = 3 down?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He has no defence against any contract by EW|pg||
nt|rodvenn: Hofta will go on to 6 and Madala will save i think. Not poosible to get minus 4 in practise|pg||
nt|sharkey: slam time|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@d=4+|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@H= negative freebid|pg||
nt|brolucius: Why not raise to 4@H?|pg||
nt|athene: EW do play a slightly strange form of Polish club|pg||
nt|andyv:  just needed 2-2 @ds and @hs to behave...not too much to ask|pg||
nt|rv: 2@c seems precision style|pg||
nt|drorp: yep, and they will|pg||
nt|athene: EW will surely take the money rather than risk 5@H|pg||
nt|april7: 4@S only 3 down|pg||
nt|drorp: 4@S from south surely, then versace will have to bid 5@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceblue: NS play prec, EW 2over1|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 2NT game-forcing with support I assume|pg||
nt|brolucius: Obvious to attack when dummy is known to hold a five-card side suit.|pg||
nt|jkotor: weak SPL?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: 3NT balanced minimum|pg||
nt|brgpro: hi|pg||
nt|capercliff: yes 1@s was pretty normal? 4@s is maybe a better contract|pg||
nt|paulg:  1@s is very usual for them|pg||
nt|sharkey: sry - missing 2 aces|pg||
nt|lesniak: to pogarsza sytuacje|pg||

nt|lesniak: bo mam nadzieje ze Cezary moze powiedziec 3 kier forsujace|pg||
nt|andyv:  spec says 8-11 any singleton, 3@h asks and 3N shows @d singleton|pg||
nt|hedyg: Bas says Bocchi was told 2@H is strong so maybe it isnt a NFB|pg||
nt|iain sime: This has allowed South another chance.|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@S = minors |pg||
nt|barnets: but in fact they led a spade v 3N in other room from south dont ask me why|pg||
nt|schtsch: low heart lead in closed|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 2@d=@H|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2@S is what Kelsey used to describe as daisy-picking.|pg||
nt|athene: they play 4-card heart opener so the weak NT option in 1@C denies 4 hearts|pg||
nt|gulyas: sry, 15-17 with @Cs|pg||
nt|gulyas: an easy game here - some might try 6@C and succeed, but its not easy to bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: or 11+ 3suiter singleton @d|pg||

nt|brolucius: The defenders took their @DA and declarer broached trumps with low to the queen and king, followed by the overruff.|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: nice one|pg||
nt|andyv:  in OR, S overcalled 2@h and EW played 2@S|pg||
nt|andyv:  I had Adam sign it but he fell asleep|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: 2@D 2-way xyz?|pg||
nt|bagman: Italians are known to bid slams without 2 aces but I think that this generation uses RKCB as routine|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2way checkback, yes|pg||
nt|brolucius: The old 2-ace-missing system was so that opponents did at least have a chance of beating them.|pg||
nt|hedyg: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/May/OpenTeams/italy/duboin-sementa.pdf|pg||
nt|bagman: And indeed in Stockholm they did|pg||
nt|bagman: West is going to make a try|pg||
nt|Walddk2: As we see, 4@S can be defeated on best defence|pg||
nt|hedyg: over 2@d they bid up the line, i.e. with 4@Hs he would show those first|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Heart lead ruffed, diamond to the ace, heart ruff, and @SA|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, a heart is a plausible lead. It would stand out if West had actually bid hearts, since East has shown a balanced hand.|pg||
nt|sharkey: Even with a @C back goes down|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes S gets a 2nd chance to find the right return|pg||
nt|bagman: No, but N gets the ruff|pg||
nt|brolucius: If North is leading a heart, expecting it to be ruffed, he should lead a suit-preference card.|pg||
nt|bagman: On club return W probably tries to ditch the diamond|pg||
nt|hedyg: but N has no indication of 4 cards in @H in W|pg||
nt|brolucius: Learned kibitzers claim that it is OBVIOUS to play in no-trumps.|pg||
nt|sharkey: rite - so far W has only shown @S so not obvious to lead @H for ruff|pg||
nt|marlowepi: another cheesy takeout double, though at the colours fairly normal|pg||
nt|sybarra: remember these are seniors not juniors  |pg||
nt|hedyg: 10@s for free|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: This is possibly the longest I ever saw Duboin take to lead lol|pg||
nt|hedyg: he knows he is leading into a double stopper|pg||
nt|mdgraham: might reach 6@C here|pg||
nt|drorp: Versace doubling at first, to show a better hand than 4@H directly, but this plan backfires|pg||
nt|april7: possible EW going overboard because both think  p has singleton @S|pg||
nt|athene: 4nt unusual, offering choice of minors|pg||
nt|toral5: @D guess 4 an ot|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Well, the right combination of 14 counts will produce a slam|pg||

nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
nt|brolucius: 4@H would have bought it. Another instructive bidding hand.|pg||
nt|barnets: and so THEN the breaks are good and he will make it|pg||
nt|andyv:  with all the intermediates, do you think W has an invite with her 8 count, Barbara?|pg||
nt|babs59: I wouldn't|pg||
pc|s4|nt|athene: 3-3 diamonds and the double club stop mean this won't take too long|pg||
nt|sybarra: do they play this as a puppet sequence.  looks like it |pg||
nt|bjacobs: Looks like it, in an unusual setting|pg||
nt|mdgraham: actually there was no guess in 6@D - two unavoidable losers at least |pg||

nt|fabsayc: or rather bid in such a way as hard to judge if making|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes|pg||
nt|pasker: I think W may have been able to put Madala to a trump guess on that deal as @C weakness was marked|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Madala took all 13 by dropping @HQ, 11 IMPs to Italy|pg||

nt|capercliff: what else Hedy? pass?|pg||
nt|hedyg: that doesnt go as a 1@s opening bid in 1st seat vuln for me|pg||
nt|hedyg: too strong for a weak 2?|pg||
nt|capercliff: yes|pg||
nt|hedyg: you need a lot to make game, if pd cannot bid over a weak 2 i am not going anywhere|pg||
nt|capercliff: duck 2 @c and down 3|pg||
nt|hedyg: Bocchi found the @H lead in OR|pg||
nt|hedyg: he can make this|pg||
nt|iain sime: Should survive.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5@H also makes|pg||
nt|hedyg: must get @hs right|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Impossible to go wrong, really|pg||

nt|athene: but there aren't really any fresh woods and pastures new that look particularly promising|pg||

pc|sK|nt|hedyg: 4 or 5|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's a miracle that a diamond stands up after the support, and yet they can't beat it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So there is something wrong with Madala's judgement in my opinion|pg||
nt|hedyg: and also got the @c ruff|pg||
nt|Walddk2: David's point is valid. *IF* North thinks he can give partner5 a heart ruff on lead, he should also leader a high card in order to show preference for the higher suit, diamonds|pg||
nt|brolucius: South has shown big black two-suiter, so cannot hold all three hearts.|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: czy B-N graj¹ w tej chwili w Tunezji?|pg||

nt|iceblue: 2NT is nat fg, It is very puplar in china|pg||

nt|lesniak: w polsce nie stosuje sie odpowiedzi na Blackwooda pokazujace renons- szkoda|pg||
nt|bagman: 4@H makes now easily but generally this kind of contract can be quite delicate because of the misfit. It cannot stand bad breaks|pg||
nt|petergill: 6@C is a good contract, but both finesses fail|pg||
nt|rv: possibly 4@s is kickback asking for key cards in @hs and South's 5@c shows 1 key|pg||

nt|petergill: 3@C showed 3+ card support|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: N has shown @H+@D|pg||

nt|rv: I am completely lost now and will stop guessing|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mdgraham: according to the CC, 3@c is Stayman|pg||
nt|hedyg: by Zivkovic|pg||
nt|bagman: The lead hurts more declarer's nerves than the contract|pg||
nt|athene: but italian style is always double to show a good hand, almost irrespective of distribution|pg||
pc|c5|nt|capercliff: he should have taken time on this one however, it was much better to play on @c's before playing a @s|pg||
nt|capercliff: he may even had made it|pg||
nt|henryb:  still one down, as he cannot untangle tricks|pg||
nt|capercliff: only 1 Henry?|pg||

nt|paulg:  yes, who worries about (the number of) undertricks when non-vul |pg||
nt|hedyg: wow|pg||
nt|hedyg: they will play for ever!|pg||
nt|paulg:  more importantly, for some, Italy are still 0-1|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  no, I meant that even playing clubs first declarer would be down one|pg||
nt|capercliff: I was chatting with Roland last night, he was saying he might walk down to watch. This was at 56-56, thought he may get anothre hour of it:)|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer has quite safe 10 tricks by drawing trumps and giving away 2 clubs and a diamond|pg||

nt|xenya: here, at any rate, it has proved to be wrong |pg||
nt|bagman: Now N is interested to know if 3@H shows suit or just strength|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Otherwise South will not know if he should lead a club or a diamond|pg||
nt|marlowepi: best lead for NS. looks like a snoring hand, but the double increasing likelihood of bad breaks in key suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nothing you could have done if he had|pg||
nt|petergill: Normal contract at both tables, well bid, unlucky , assuming no @h lead|pg||
pc|h7|nt|mdgraham: 3@d/@H=transfers|pg||
nt|bjacobs: A simple approach is to just hope @HQ drops doubleton|pg||
nt|hedyg: hmm|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The point is moot now, so much for science|pg||
nt|hedyg: here N had the info and did not find the @H lead|pg||
nt|sharkey: Not their day - that was yesterday......|pg||
nt|athene: if north had a huge heart or diamond suit he might have bid it instead of 2@S perhaps|pg||
nt|snetram:  okazuje siÄ Å¼e sztucznie teÅ¼ moÅ¼na|pg||
nt|jkotor: mam dobre wpomaganie od Szwedów na priv|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: The lead wasn't really @SQ, there was no lead|pg||
nt|petergill: There is a silly double dummy line to make, which will not happen|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Possibly a misunderstanding of the meaning of 4@D|pg||
nt|rv: 5@h/5n are last making contracts|pg||
nt|cumino: Yes 4@D nat for Manara|pg||
nt|rv: you need lots of practise playing complicated relay based systems, otherwise you tend to lose more than you gain by such disasters|pg||
pc|h4|nt|sybarra: but with the 3 @S bid,  looks like puppet |pg||
nt|Walddk2: What do you think, do the players from the "lesser" nations enjoy playing against Italy or do they fear it, especially when they are on vugraph?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if I read it right|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Both|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I think both as well|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I saw a Serbian player take the match card with the countries and player names yesterday :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: there is a lot of pressure when you are on Vugraph |pg||
nt|mbruun: Possible push for Lithuania. Ceasefire|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Enormous pressure.  They would surely MUCH prefer to play the Italians in a small private room with no one watching|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: My first and only match on BBO was a disaster, it was against Belgium :(|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I would guess that they would be up for it. Lithuanians are a fiercely proud people |pg||
nt|bjacobs: This is a really complex position|pg||
nt|bjacobs: One possibility for Duboin is to ruff a club, then plan to discard a spade on the 4th club, then ruff a spade - finally the heart finesse|pg||
nt|bagman: he can discard one of the diamonds on the @SQ|pg||
nt|andyv:  E could see 10 tricks if @hs broke|pg||
nt|andyv:  now he has to decide how to tackle the @d and @c suits|pg||
nt|bagman: If trumps were 4-0, declarer needs some luck elsewhere|pg||
nt|bagman: He's safe to draw the last trump and establis a trick in clubs |pg||
nt|koksoy: he  may  try  ruffing 2  clubs|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer is afraid of having one of the diamond winners ruffed.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|bagman: Now declarer goes up and starts trumps|pg||
nt|bagman: no need to guess|pg||
nt|petergill: Usually it's better to set up the side suit first, on hands like this one in 5@HX|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good afternoon to Paul Gipson|pg||
nt|corplaw: another pickup for croatia on club guess|pg||
pc|h2|pg||

nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|hedyg: Bocchi had no info|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, that too.|pg||
nt|andyv:  vul vs. none, you need about 42-44% chance of making game to bid it in mp.|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I am sorry, I lost the play here|pg||
nt|ziff:  Yes. Ruff two @Ds, cash 2 @S, throw in South with the last @C|pg||
pc|c4|nt|athene: yes, the multi allowed EW to say their piece at a lower level and then give up |pg||
nt|paulg:  Hi everyone|pg||
pc|c9|nt|bjacobs: Or even discard two spades on two clubs?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: An interesting expansion of the basic plan|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If it's true what you are saying, the Italians have an advantage when they buy a vugraph box for the entire tournament. Everyone is forced to play against them on vugraph|pg||
nt|mbruun: They have many advantages, the Vu-graph, their system, their cardplay. |pg||
nt|bjacobs: This play is fraught as well - if South is 3-3-4-3, he will eventually be able to overruff dummy|pg||
nt|mamos: yes setting up Clubs may be harder |pg||
nt|frululu: by ouch y mean a good score in american football ? |pg||
nt|schtsch: don't need it|pg||
nt|corplaw: or spade trick :)|pg||
pc|s9|nt|koksoy: that  is  @C A  and ruff  @H Q  THEN|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Another win for 4th best from your longest and strongest|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|hedyg: hmmm he might try to disc the @d now?|pg||
nt|petergill: East is endplayed after he ruffs the @D and has to accept 800 instead of 1100  - he will try a low club from his king |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not easy to play that trump suit for 1 loser|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: after 46 in big swings this will be a welcome score for the Swiss ladies|pg||
pc|d2|nt|tez: @d2 is suit pereferance|pg||
nt|bjacobs: She!  |pg||
nt|petergill: At the other table, Norberto Bocchi did not bid as boldly as Janis Ozols|pg||
nt|barnets: nice play|pg||
nt|barnets: gives north a dilemma|pg||
nt|petergill: Duboin, anticipating the endplay, works out that it's better to play a club from his side than to give partner the @d ruff. Classy, as long as it doesn't backfire.|pg||
nt|ziff:  Probably doesn t work, even, as everything is blocked afterwards|pg||
nt|cumino: Normally on 2@C the relay is 2@D, 2NT is for two switers FG, no support in @C|pg||
pc|d7|nt|Walddk2: An additional advantage then, as if they need more|pg||
nt|Gerben42: thats impressive bridging|pg||
pc|dA|nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|henryb:  He won't get within 100 yards of it unless he went at about 9AM|pg||
nt|hedyg: now @d finesse would have been netter|pg||
nt|hedyg: better even|pg||
pc|d3|nt|rv: even 6n had a chance with non @h lead and right view in @s with lucky fall of @DJ in 3 rounds|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Last hope is a revoke|pg||
pc|d9|nt|atabey: that italian imp could be fake :) I cant see a way for sementa to take 11 tricks on board 4|pg||
nt|andyv:  undertricks are going to be expensive|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: show of hands: who would have doubled with Madala's cards?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The smaller federations can't afford that |pg||
nt|koksoy: HÝ  Paul|pg||
pc|dT|nt|fabsayc: next|pg||
nt|april7: an immediate 5 @H would have asked E about second round control in @S|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|mbruun: See your point|pg||
nt|hedyg: not Duboin, no greed!|pg||
mc|10|nt|petergill: I think it was better to pitch a @D there, not a spade|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: I'm not seeing a reason, an Ace and maybe 2 @H tricks?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 6.4 IMPs/board, not a bad average|pg||

nt|andyv:  first imps to Italy as the stopped in 3@h and made on board 3|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Indeed, you can't take tricks away the defenders won before the revoke|pg||
nt|drorp: portugal win 12 on board 4, setting doubeled vul contracts at both sides|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Look at this bad bridge, twice as many contracts down as made! :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: By playing on spades W took out every possible compication and was guaranteed to make at least 10 tricks|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: Madala is originally from Argentina, I believe|pg||
nt|stc: and like Germany|pg||
nt|cumino: 3NT only by North|pg||
nt|rv: y presume 1n by North now|pg||
mb|1H|nt|athene: now we see if NS play the style that lets them stop in 3major after 2nt opener|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I was kidding btw :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|brgpro: i dont know their style, but lauria-versace will bid 2@d, showing 6+@h|pg||
nt|jtr: X shows 4+@hs suually as an extension of transfer responses|pg||
nt|andyv:  if you dbl and take the same tricks, it's 14 imps... but, if you warn declarer of the suit break and it goes down only 1 (8 imps) or makes 14 imps against you... not a good return for your dbl|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: quite right|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: EW making 8 tricks in 5@C?|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: NS *can* pick up 800 off this|pg||

nt|bagman: North had the guts to bid the preemptive 3@H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That too|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am not in favour of people changing nationality. The European 100 metre record is now held by a Nigerian (changed to Portuguese). The same when Danish people become Londoners...|pg||

nt|bagman: South is maximum for his limited opening|pg||
nt|andyv:  S certainly bought a great dummy|pg||
nt|Walddk8: Those Lavazza girls again|pg||
nt|rv: South may bid 3@d here or jump to 3n not to give room for West to indicate lead?|pg||
nt|athene: many pairs these days don't|pg||
mb|p|nt|brgpro: that's a Kokish influence|pg||

nt|brolucius: changed position of the defenders' cards so that the winning play would be necessary). |pg||
nt|andyv:  N should respect the dbl|pg||
nt|paulg:  I see that Sementa disagrees with you too Hedy, on what to open @sAKQxxx ... of course they all went minus|pg||
nt|capercliff: the defence was not as sharp in the other room on brd 4, it was allowed to make|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Lauria bid 5@S, Versace 6@C and Broge in the tank now|pg||
nt|hedyg: it is surely overwhelming for the Slovakia team to be playing vs Italy AND on VG|pg||
nt|pasker: but holds a very suit oreintated hand |pg||
nt|hedyg: Madala is Italian now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol David|pg||
nt|athene: lauria-versace's auction looks strange|pg||
nt|gulyas: I expect them to bid this for a push|pg||
nt|cicus: I might have considered 1@S overcall as West|pg||
nt|athene: if 3@C is a game try, why didn't east respect the 3@H sign-off?|pg||
nt|koksoy: now  2 |pg||
nt|bagman: Sementa is neither happy to pass nor happy to bid|pg||
nt|babs59: the East hand certainly had the fillers for West's hand, together with South's @CAK|pg||
mb|d|nt|tez: 7@h/7@s ok but how?|pg||
nt|daman: this should fail on a @C lead|pg||
nt|brolucius: A welcome flat board for Slovakia.|pg||
nt|Gerben42: Ozols thinking another 1-level contract for me|pg||
nt|petergill: A good start by Latvia. Against the big guns, they beat Germany 16-14 (a great result), lost 13-17 to Bulgaria and lost 12-18 to Iceland, so they are doing quite well against the ...|pg||
nt|petergill: "heavies"|pg||
nt|petergill: so Latvia have already played many of the top teams and are doing well to be in the top half of the field|pg||
nt|athene: maybe 3@C is just probing for the best game, keeping 3nt in the picture|pg||
mb|p|nt|brgpro: well, i would think X shows 5+@h...other wise we cant explain the 2@h bid from S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: looks suspiciously natural, that 2NT|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Currently conversion to IMPs would mean a 25-1 victory to Italy|pg||
nt|sybarra: protecting the aqxx of @H and the K's |pg||

nt|rv: Double by North should show max hand, can't be penalty/trump stack since she already denied 4@hs by 1n bid|pg||
nt|drorp: N transfers and signs off, 3@S is alot worse than 2NT but he can't know that|pg||
nt|toral5: interesting dbl here|pg||
mb|2D|nt|brolucius: You can look back at it later. Declarer led towards his club honor, hoping to find the ace on his right.|pg||
nt|paulg:  with only one entry to his hand, pass looks an easy call|pg||
nt|athene: can versace get anything other than his five obvious tricks? those spade spots are very small|pg||
nt|athene: i suppose he can just force with the fourth club|pg||
nt|athene: that should do the trick|pg||
nt|drorp: can short declearer with his 4th club, eventually|pg||
nt|drorp: 2 down is my bet|pg||

nt|hedyg: obviously cuebid|pg||
nt|henryb:  tough to find @d after this start|pg||
nt|hedyg: Fantoni would have opened 2@s :p|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well judged, big swing to Norway|pg||
nt|rodvenn: well bid. can he find the spade q?|pg||

nt|athene: i am told 2@D in the other room was not a heart raise|pg||

nt|schtsch: as pick your poison|pg||
nt|wstuart: I don't see how he can move from 2@S here|pg||

nt|vasmar: 4 losers|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Simpson claiming he has a minimum|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N hoping S has something like Axx of spades and short clubs|pg||
nt|marlowepi: agree he has a minimum 3S bid:)|pg||
nt|stc: anyway, in bridge you don't even need a to be citizen to represent a country...|pg||
nt|rnmalik: P has passed 1@H, imo defend NT.|pg||
pc|s6|nt|bagman: MIght not be flat|pg||
nt|bagman: a heart now and declarer might settle for his 9 tops|pg||
nt|brolucius: If Slovakia finish in the bottom half of the table, Italy's (magnificent) score from this match will count for nothing. You only carry over your scores against qualifying teams.|pg||
nt|sharkey: this reminds me of when we got a WO in a Pairs tournament after 5 rounds - finally achieving a Plus round|pg||
nt|bagman: or S might duck the @HJ and get 10 tricks by setting up the clubs|pg||
nt|hedyg: they are 14th so far|pg||
nt|brolucius: Respectable with such a small population.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Anyway, if you are going to have a string of awful boards, best to group them together in just one match.|pg||
nt|mamos: North has been conservative too|pg||
nt|barnets: e/w can make  3@C here|pg||
nt|ziff:  Various kibitzers have improved on my line by drawing only two trump before playing the 3rd @S. This seems to work, but nobody plays that way without mirrors in the room|pg||
nt|schtsch: and bocchi will pass it if it happens|pg||
nt|rv: well bid by Italian ladies here, all the more creditable after disaster in last deal|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|jtr: Tactical decision maybe|pg||
nt|henryb:  need to lead a club|pg||
nt|capercliff: is that what the double was for?|pg||

nt|pasker: oh yes sorry|pg||

nt|rv: I might have led @HA from East hand hoping for stiff honor|pg||
nt|drorp: now @C, A@S, and 4th @C|pg||
nt|drorp: not hard|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Yuval Yener|pg||
pc|dK|nt|brolucius: North would rarely lead the @HA from a combination such as A-Q-x, but here the bidding had suggested that neither East nor West held a heart control.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No, just a permanent resident for some time|pg||
nt|cicus: I expected E to try some club ruffs|pg||
nt|hedyg: once pd showed the rounded suits..|pg||
nt|athene: no reason for versace to jump in with a big spade first round anyway, even if declarer really does have the queen|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4 card majors|pg||
nt|hedyg: bd 6 Swiss in 5@c|pg||

pc|s2|nt|iceblue: How do you think about this 3@C? Jack|pg||
nt|atabey: would be a good auction if K of @h was offside with a @d lead|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@H over 2@H would show a stronger hand|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: nightmare time for EW, for sure, these few boards|pg||
nt|mbruun: Looks like a quick push|pg||
nt|capercliff: not sure even a @c lead would beat it tho?|pg||
nt|snetram:  co powinno pokazywaÄ renons|pg||
nt|hedyg: seems Lauria's lead gives the contract|pg||
nt|stc: and, as in the case of Madala you may play for different countries|pg||
nt|yuval10: and Sapan|pg||
pc|s8|nt|brgpro: normal|pg||
nt|brolucius: West did hold a singleton heart, in fact, but chose not to cue-bid it because of the general minimum nature of his hand.|pg||
nt|bagman: South needs to return a club after taking the @CA|pg||
nt|petergill: Yes, there's a lack of entries to dummy|pg||
nt|paulg:  everyone playing double dummy now|pg||
nt|rv: don't like @c lead|pg||

nt|paulg:  Piper's 3NT was some bid by a passed hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Hey Harmon|pg||
nt|hedyg: hi Harmon :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  easily: defense sets up two clubs to go with 2@h and the @dA|pg||
nt|capercliff: yes sry 2@c'c, 2@h's and a @d|pg||
nt|henryb:  I have to leave you for Chicago|pg||
nt|hedyg: bye Henry, ty|pg||
nt|paulg:  i guess Piper knows that North will probably hold a couple of diamonds, as he did not use the 2@H opener (three suits, short in diamonds)|pg||
nt|capercliff: cu Henry, thanks|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Awww Henry|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Thanks Henry, enjoy :)|pg||
nt|paulg:  Piper/Wilkinson have an excellent attitude and memories like goldfish ... a bad score never fazes them|pg||
nt|bagman: ducking twice is fatal|pg||
nt|bagman: Time to count decarer's tricks|pg||
nt|andyv:  his choices would appear limited... either a club or a club or a club|pg||
nt|bagman: Nothing to do if partner hasn't go a trump trick|pg||
nt|brolucius: You can measure the strength of a bridge player by counting the countries in the world that would welcome the player into their national team.|pg||
nt|athene: east will surely hope for the @CQ onside|pg||
nt|schtsch: that's for deception|pg||
nt|schtsch: to give them hope|pg||
nt|corplaw: decl still has some work to do now that didn't finesse JD|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|Walddk2: 2NT asking, 3NT= 15+ 5-2-4-2 or 5-3-4-1|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ugis: or even 2h|pg||
pc|c6|nt|brgpro: i would bid 1@h and, if necessary, bid 2@H again|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|brgpro: but what is important: after 2/1, 3 level new suit better be 5|pg||
nt|lesniak: na 100% pytanie tylko czy pokazuje renons czy tez pyta o asy z wylaczeniem|pg||
nt|sybarra: wonderful system |pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: OK, someting is terribly wrong here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but even with 4 card majors 1S is somewhat questionable, and the double a bit more so holding 3 clubs |pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Declarer ran the hearts then played a small @S|pg||
nt|babs59: regarding last board, many people move with 8 HCP opposite a 15-17 NT|pg||
pc|cK|nt|bagman: Now Sementa needs to dicard the clubs and see what happens|pg||
nt|brolucius: The Smith peter is a signal, normally used only in no-trumps. You play high or low on declarer's first suit (when a count signal is not needed) to say something about how much you ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: like the opening lead.|pg||

nt|andyv:  actually too well for NS's liking|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer makes 4 trumps one way or another|pg||
pc|c8|nt|barnets: while there appears only 4 losers the entries are tough |pg||
nt|rv: Miriam is aware that her partner is a near yarborough (no points), so she should try to lead her best suit and honor lead is better than 4th or 3rd best|pg||
nt|drorp: claim coming|pg||
pc|c4|nt|Walddk2: We have Valerio Guibilo in the audience to explain the sequences by E-W if we need it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Very nice|pg||
nt|hedyg: only 1 overtrick|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: According to piper only 9 trick|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: *tricks|pg||
nt|capercliff: he will claim|pg||
nt|stc: Zia also played at first for Pakistan :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  in imps more will move than mps|pg||
nt|petergill: The club ruff is with the trump winner, 110|pg||
nt|schtsch: @dA|pg||
nt|corplaw: AD and low diamond may be best|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|babs59: I tend not to unless a decent 5 card suit...  applying a Jim Borin 'law'|pg||
pc|cA|nt|bagman: I would guess that declarer cashes out now instead of trying to be a hero|pg||
nt|lesniak: zagranie 9 pik przez Cezarego bylo doskonale|pg||
nt|babs59: which was not to move when the MAXIMUM was the min. you needed for game|pg||
pc|c9|nt|brgpro: if not max, then better be concentrated suits|pg||
nt|Gerben42: @H10 will still be lost, so 80|pg||
nt|koksoy: he  can  do  nothing ...  500|pg||
nt|paulg:  two down and -500, i guess everyone reasonably happy|pg||
pc|c5|nt|andyv:  just not counting |pg||
nt|cicus: this is an easy hand, it goes down anyway :)|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|rodvenn: everybody knows this is about the spade q|pg||
pc|hA|nt|brolucius: There is a general consensus that you should always cue-bid an ace, provided it does not raise the level of the contract. With a second-round control, you can take a view and ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: decline to cue-bid if you are not suitable for a slam. |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Why would you not be suitable for slam with five controls?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Indeed. I would have bid 4@H.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Particularly as East had not bid that suit.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I am asked about controls. The ace is worth two, the king one control|pg||
nt|Walddk4: So AAK = five|pg||
nt|brolucius: It's a slight problem with auctions that have become game-forcing. The needs to cue-bid controls and to show slam suitability clash somewhat.|pg||
nt|bagman: Pressure|pg||
nt|koksoy: 4@H  need  some  effort|pg||
pc|h3|nt|bagman: Sementa is probably especially happy because defending at 2 level with void vs Q9xxx is always quite risky|pg||
nt|koksoy: and  3nt  is  lay down|pg||
pc|h2|nt|brolucius: He felt a bit guilty at switching and asked the US team to wear Pakistani costume on one occasion.|pg||

nt|atabey: that was a strong hand over 2@h|pg||
nt|tez: other table playing 6|pg||
nt|othered1: i think 6@H was right on last hand, given far less than high likelihood of @D lead.|pg||
nt|andyv:  not sure what W dbld on unless it was to stop pd from bidding|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: NS may have missed chance of +800 ..but got +850  :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Are you saying Pass is forcing? :P|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So 13 IMPs to Norway on board 6|pg||
nt|rodvenn: if East had had the spade q, he would have bid more strongly|pg||
nt|bagman: This looks like a flat 4@H with an overtrick|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: After 7 compared boards a 60 IMP lead would be 25-0 with 9 IMPs to spare|pg||
nt|sybarra: do we have the right bd?|pg||
nt|mamos: i think North is worth 3@h if South had rebid 2@D so not quite sure what has happened here|pg||
nt|iain sime: Italy were losing 12 imps anyway so the lead only cost two more.|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I think, by David's measure, Zia must be the best player in the world, for who wouldn't want him on their team?|pg||
nt|brolucius: A diamond lead seems to look right from that East hand.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, he would pick up the whole world.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Same with Meckstroth and Rodwell, and the great Italians.|pg||
nt|petergill: As we are seeing, 3@H can be beaten |pg||
nt|Gerben42: +80 almost never feels bad|pg||
nt|Gerben42: EW turn again|pg||
nt|petergill: To make 2@H, you have to cross to @SQ to lead a heart up, then duck a heart|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 5@D the top spot|pg||
nt|petergill: In 1@H, North's play was just fine, was the safest way to play 1@H|pg||
nt|gulyas: so, a push as expected|pg||
nt|andyv:  and Bulgaria struck back with a 12 imp swing when 3N was set on board 4|pg||

nt|hedyg: Open one browser window per table|pg||
nt|bagman: He probably knew but was considering that the contract cannot go down unless he can cash another @H trick|pg||
nt|mamos: though I dont play 4 card majors  I dont think its the system thats gone wrong here |pg||
nt|marlowepi: the description of the play siuggests a NT contract, probably N bid 2N over 2S|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: It was the right board, I just entered the wrong contract, my apologies|pg||
nt|schtsch: his head is too big to fit through the screen hole|pg||

nt|xenya: yes, and he knew spades were 3-3|pg||
nt|xenya: 2@S?|pg||
nt|bagman: Here it is very hard to misguess something in the play|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: You know what they say about @D :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: always a good topic for debate about whether 1NT should be take-out or natural here |pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 2NT=19-23 balanced|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If you must jump to 2NT now, I think you have lost the advantage of opening 1@C|pg||

nt|hedyg: oh|pg||
nt|hedyg: well then he had 10 tricks|pg||
nt|stc: NS may defend in 5@d|pg||

nt|atabey: T/O and goodish|pg||
nt|othered1: A possible line on last h and is to cash @HA then try to get @D discard on 4th @S.  I don't think that's best, however.|pg||

nt|capercliff: if he went up with the K then they need to give him 10 tricks?|pg||
nt|bagman: It is possible that E leads a club and then a spade back forces declarer to go up|pg||

nt|bagman: It's hard to locate a weakness in partner's 4 card suit|pg||
nt|andyv:  a lot riding on the opening lead|pg||
nt|pasker: true lauria might not lead a @S|pg||

nt|skorchev: 3@H by South is either slam interest with @S fit or @S fit, balanced fit, intending to play 3nt/4@S|pg||
nt|skorchev: *balanced hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: you can use this idea over a 1NT opening|pg||
nt|bagman: Sementa has goodish spade intermediates and a fitting Q + singleton|pg||
nt|paulg:  from what I've seen, it is wrong to describe any Duboin as invitational ... it is just a transfer for Sementa to bid game|pg||
nt|koksoy: :)|pg||
nt|rv: Gabrielle's raise to 4@s seems to be very optimistic|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|hedyg: nice selfcontrol by Assael|pg||
nt|hedyg: anyhow isn't it more likely he plays a @d back?|pg||
nt|bagman: yes|pg||
nt|hedyg: where 4@s was bid and made|pg||
nt|hedyg: on bd 7|pg||
nt|bagman: Sementa might duck this to keep multiple options|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Girls need a deck of cards... A @H to love a man, a @D to marry him, a @C to whack him in the head and a @S to bury him|pg||
nt|babs59: I hadn't heard that one before!|pg||
nt|mdgraham: double smacks of bidding his hand twice imho |pg||
nt|ahri: madala does not look intimidated|pg||
nt|rnmalik: a @S and a @D for the defense.|pg||
pc|s9|nt|mbruun: Gutsy play|pg||
nt|paulg:  their CC does not say that 1@s is non-forcing|pg||
nt|capercliff: maybe they play it as limited|pg||
nt|athene: even though he sort of has 3 clubs, trump, diamond to lose|pg||
nt|athene: he will take nine tricks first and leave the defence to make a trump and a side-suit winner at the same time|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: http://tinyurl.com/ebc-open-b   http://tinyurl.com/ebc-open-a   http://tinyurl.com/3yl8spu (women)   http://tinyurl.com/39bvxwu (seniors)  for running Euro scores, courtesy of ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Roland Wald|pg||
pc|sK|nt|brolucius: Indeed. It is quite a modest opening bid - not so close to a strong 1@C.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, but 5-8 is more impressive.|pg||
nt|brgpro: always play pd for 5-8 HCP in these kind of auction...|pg||
nt|jtr: He wisely played them immediately|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: lol, unfamiliar with both of them :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: Oh, right|pg||
nt|brgpro: Berry Westra thought 5-8 is more likely:)|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: What's that based on then?|pg||
nt|jtr: Experience?|pg||
nt|brgpro: probability...although i dont know a bit of it:)|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: Haha, experience and probability are neighbours, aren't they? :)|pg||
nt|bagman: no|pg||
nt|andyv:  will N try to sneak a @h now?|pg||
nt|andyv:  not anymore|pg||
nt|jkotor: szansa na -2?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: :)|pg||
nt|ahri: looking at his hand and seeing half of the points there he knows what's going on :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Many play transfers after a take-out double|pg||
nt|rv: Roland, yes likely in which case East should definitely have led a trump|pg||
pc|s3|nt|brgpro: yes, just like u and me! |pg||
nt|andyv:  for running scores|pg||
nt|bagman: :)|pg||
nt|barnets: this rates to be down|pg||
nt|bagman: No the defense has to commit to some line|pg||
nt|bagman: they can draw trumps to prevent the diamond ruffs but then Sementa can set up the hearts|pg||
nt|koksoy: if  defence  can  able to  play  3rd diamond ..  then  they  may  have 2spade heart and  dimond|pg||
nt|paulg:  he is a little short of entries to do everything though|pg||
nt|koksoy: diamond  now|pg||
nt|schtsch: really? maybe he can count his honors?|pg||
nt|rv: this deal cries for a trump lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes and get partner in later with a diamond for her to play another trump|pg||
nt|drorp: Barbosa feels is AKJ642 is worth spade bids, so he'll have to play with a 6-0 fit, luckily everything is well for him so this can make 11 tricks|pg||
nt|drorp: 4 spade bids*|pg||
nt|athene: just one spade and @DA to lose|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|paulg:  and even if it did, i would raise|pg||
nt|xenya: somewhat unlucky for Norway -- 5@D is a sensible contract|pg||
nt|hedyg: lolllllll famous last words|pg||
nt|petergill: South needs to retain his @D entry to the long spades|pg||
nt|snetram:  powinno byÄ bez dwÃ³ch, ale Cezary bedzie w lekkim przymusie po ÅciÄgniÄciu pikÃ³w. Tylko wskoczenie asem trefl i zagranie w karo uwalnia go od tego|pg||
nt|bagman: A diamond continuation leaves Sementa quite badly placed in Dummy|pg||
nt|ahri: i must admit that i like 3@h|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Madala showing his hand, S W laughing|pg||
pc|h3|nt|gulyas: with Dumbovich in the driving seat, I would not be surprised at all:)|pg||
nt|gulyas: sry, its Gotthard|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Bocchi asking whether 1NT is natural or not|pg||
nt|ahri: hm seems board 7 was corrected to 2@hx-2 |pg||
nt|ahri: or I might have been blind|pg||
nt|athene: @SAK and a small one will work very nicely - if he chooses that|pg||
pc|h5|nt|daman: this probably requires careful play     ergo the delay|pg||
nt|daman: USA  and England won their soccer matches|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: So Algeria and Slovakia are out of the Football World Cup? :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Sorry George, couldn't resist :)|pg||
nt|daman: I believe so|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I am being told Slovenia|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I was just testing George kibs :) Haha|pg||
nt|bagman: NS have probably promised both majors and clubs as the trick suit|pg||
nt|andyv:  nice method|pg||
nt|fabsayc: see my website for an explanation of this idea|pg||
nt|petergill: Making 3@S requires good guessing in @h and @C|pg||
nt|cumino: Even after A@h trump is normal|pg||
pc|hA|nt|fabsayc: under 50%|pg||
nt|Gerben42: it was a part of the Romex system, designed by Mexican top player George Rosenkrantz|pg||
nt|petergill: when a @D is led towards dummy, South needs to duck. Is this hard?|pg||
nt|lesniak: tak|pg||
nt|paulg:  if he ruffed two diamonds, then he'd need the club finesse for a heart pitch and doesn't have the entries for that ....|pg||
nt|paulg:  unless the defence helps!|pg||
nt|koksoy: now  he  may  crossruff|pg||
nt|bagman: This was helpful; now he can afford to ruff the diamonds |pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|mbruun: Looks like a minirally of 1 IMP|pg||
nt|paulg:  i wonder if Wilkinson misread the auction and thought that East bid it|pg||
nt|bagman: now the rest is easy|pg||
nt|barnets: same contract same lead in the open|pg||
nt|babs59: entries are interesting this hand|pg||
nt|schtsch: of course, but his stopper is a bit tiny|pg||
nt|athene: but he might try for some sort of elopement|pg||
pc|hK|nt|andyv:  finally a calm board for Lebanon|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe the 3 was attitude?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: When there are imps to be won, you have to go for it|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer did consider rising with the @SA... for about 0.0001 milliseconds.|pg||
nt|cicus: still no surprise|pg||
nt|gulyas: :)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|hedyg: claim|pg||
nt|jkotor: Adam lavinthalowa³ trefle, wiêc jest na to czas|pg||
nt|rv: Swiss ladies have been kind not to double this contract as well, generally you get away with overbidding if opps don't have good trumps:)|pg||
nt|athene: just ruffing things in hand|pg||
pc|h4|nt|jtr: Nicely played by Bocchi|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@H asked for a @H stopper|pg||
nt|bagman: Logical to lead a diamond|pg||
nt|vasmar: a potential plus for Cyprus|pg||
nt|petergill: Moment of truth|pg||
nt|petergill: Playing the opening bidder for @HA was reasonable but unlucky|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|iain sime: Not sure about this line. the heart king was an entry.|pg||
nt|petergill: Very difficult play for South|pg||

nt|petergill: The auction, with the 3@d raise, suggested EW HCP are about 12-9. |pg||

nt|toral5: another routine M game|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceblue: Muiderberg 2@S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 13 IMPs to Italy on 7. The Italians found the defence against 3NT. @HQ to the ace and a diamond switch|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|brgpro: 6@d needs @hA to be on...|pg||
nt|brolucius: That deal is worthy of another look afterwards. Very instructive that Bocchi established the spades before playing on trumps. |pg||

nt|pasker: but has worked out well enough here|pg||
nt|vasmar: first seat you mean|pg||
nt|andyv:  if that's all you have in your arsenal, you may as well use it|pg||
nt|bagman: W comes in with 4NT?|pg||
nt|andyv:  -500|pg||
nt|bagman: IT cannot be S thinking|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: W blocking out all sound now, hands over his eyes and fingers in his ears|pg||
nt|andyv:  but may talk N into bidding on|pg||
nt|bagman: over 4NT N can bid on with X|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I haven't even done a slamtease yet ;)|pg||
nt|hedyg: rofl|pg||
nt|barnets: it is better for dec to play th @D at trick 2 before the defense know what is going on|pg||
nt|petergill: Well deserved imps to Italy |pg||
nt|barnets: if the clubs are good they will always be good|pg||
nt|athene: but a pre-empt can do that to you|pg||
nt|athene: one area of the game where i am sure most pairs don't have enough methods is after a 3nt overcall of a pre-empt|pg||
nt|gulyas: 4@S makes more tricks - in fact, you  have to guess @Ss to to make 3NT at all|pg||
nt|athene: it can cover such a wide range of shapes and strengths, you need a lot of kit to investigate the best game or slam|pg||
nt|jkotor: mo¿na te¿ powiedzieæ, ¿e bardzo ³adne rozdanie Szwedów|pg||
nt|lesniak: rozgrywk¹|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: Spades and a minor, 5-5|pg||
nt|petergill: which makes East about a 9/17 chance of having @HA in my opinion, so it was a close guess in @H|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|andyv:  probably need a @c lead to stop 4@s|pg||
nt|bjacobs: German term|pg||
nt|petergill: Possibly, but at Trick 2 it seems natural to duck to retain your entry. At Trick 4, perhaps it seemed less clear?|pg||
nt|athene: 2@H rather than 3@H makes things much easier|pg||
nt|athene: now transfer and west will do something very enthusiastic|pg||
nt|athene: to show his monster support for spades|pg||
nt|gulyas: 6@S makes with good guesses, not likely to be bid tho|pg||
nt|cicus: still not an easy overcall, double is a sensible alternative|pg||
nt|athene: west wants to play game facing just five spades and a yarborough, pretty much|pg||
nt|lesniak: oczywiscie uzylibysmy innych przymiotnikow gdyby S mial K trefl|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: np :)|pg||
nt|paulg:  1@d promises 0 diamonds, not an ideal start to this hand|pg||
nt|bagman: Is N going to bury the @Hs|pg||
nt|andyv:  balancing with W hand ok in mp... but not great in imps.|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: A Dutch invention|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Google solves all|pg||
nt|bagman: nice result in the open room|pg||
nt|bagman: Difficult situation. 5m can go down a lot and there was no guarantees that 4@H makes|pg||
mb|3S|nt|brolucius: South correctly makes no move towards game. He expects that the deal is a mis-fit and his hearts will pull little weight with spades as trumps.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 3@C seems sadistic|pg||
nt|mdgraham: apart from translating the NASZ system....|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@S is the limit and even that is not cold|pg||
nt|bagman: NS can make 5@C|pg||
nt|paulg:  3@d looks like a mixed raise in spades|pg||
nt|paulg:  so 4-card support plus a good card or two|pg||
nt|bagman: Denning has more or less shown only his range without much info about his shape|pg||
nt|paulg:  Denning might bid four or five diamonds|pg||
nt|bagman: Now it's quite hard to recover from the start|pg||
nt|paulg:  i think 5@d |pg||
nt|paulg:  three major suit cards, fit with partner, excellent suit|pg||
nt|schtsch: no action from tesla, pity|pg||
nt|schtsch: wrong vulerability|pg||
nt|ahri: 2@c is GF|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: flat super accept|pg||
nt|athene: i can't see any reason for declarer to drop the @SK here|pg||
nt|april7: 2NT is Truscott I think, but E proposes 3NT|pg||
nt|drorp: Italians continue to bid aggrresivley, and unless Versace can find the stiff K@s, it won't work for them this time aswell|pg||
nt|athene: you might make 4@S even if you lose to the @SK - you won't make 3nt|pg||
nt|athene: in 4@S you might hold the losers to @SK, @HA, and @CA, throwing a club on a heart eventually|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: tah dah|pg||
nt|bagman: They have loaded quite a lot into 1@D opening as their 2@C opening shows 6 or more|pg||
mb|4S|nt|iceblue: 2NT shud be Lebensohl|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3NT?|pg||
nt|sybarra: does S pass?|pg||
nt|hedyg: not sure Versace was bidding 4@H freely|pg||
nt|hedyg: E bid 2@C in OR|pg||
nt|sharkey: Madala did not have a good match earlier today vs Norway but sure has reddemed himself in this match|pg||
nt|hedyg: and S doubled to show a good hand|pg||
nt|bagman: N might not make a move nv|pg||
nt|hedyg: Italy won 21:9 vs Norway|pg||
nt|hedyg: that looks pretty good to me|pg||
nt|brolucius: Incredible that the Italians should actually make two cue-bids on such values. Do they see a potential slam on every deal?|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - cud have been much more...|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4 VPs more?|pg||
nt|bagman: W should not bid to sac but to make (on this vulnerability)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But declarer can overtake spades when the 10 falls and should be OK in 3|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@H raise should include 4333 10 counts. |pg||

nt|bagman: The problem with 4NT is that W gets a freeroll to X|pg||
nt|athene: a surprising choice from lauria there|pg||
nt|athene: now the scoreboard really is all square :)|pg||
nt|athene: thanks to bocchi taking a good view not to transfer|pg||
nt|april7: the contract depends on how W plays the @S suit, he can make 3@H,2@D 1@C and perhaps 3 @S, before NS has 5  tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Yalcin Atabey|pg||
nt|athene: if he loses to the @SK the defence will definitely have @SK, two diamonds, and two aces|pg||
nt|april7: K of @D and @H 10, then if he doesn't make the finesse in @S because he wants to play @H from dummy he wil  be rewarded|pg||
nt|athene: but he definitely needs the spades as well as the hearts|pg||
nt|athene: i don't see how he can refuse the spade finesse|pg||
nt|atabey: ty roland :) hi all|pg||
nt|athene: hi|pg||
nt|athene: there's plenty of room for south to have a double without the @SK|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: A direct 3@H would show values, so West travels via a Lebensohl 2NT to show a weak hand with hearts.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muiderberg_convention|pg||
nt|athene: leads a top spade to see which red suit to attack|pg||
nt|daman: 9 toppers   may be room for an overtrick |pg||
nt|capercliff: we all need to remember that the play is very fast at this table, hard for the operator to keep up sometimes|pg||
nt|hedyg: Bas is doing fine :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: bd 8 Swiss played 5@DX= for 12 imps|pg||
nt|iain sime: Should manage six trump, two clubs and a diamond.|pg||
nt|athene: ok - now it's harder :) |pg||
nt|cicus: this won't make declarer sweat|pg||
nt|athene: short of putting the stop card down and bidding 4@S, west can't really superaccept now unless he wants to risk the 5-level, which he really can't|pg||
nt|hedyg: 12 tricks are there|pg||
nt|toral5: dutch playing strong @C here?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|brolucius: 2@C is game-forcing balanced or diamond support.|pg||
nt|brgpro: they are on they way...with a lot of relays i think...although we dont really know their agreements|pg||
nt|atabey: on board 7 the lead to 6@h was a dia. declarer didnt take the @h finess. however he could pitch the @d's to @c ace and the 4th @s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Madala's 1NT backfired in the other room|pg||
nt|sharkey: in VP no - IMPs yes :)|pg||
nt|bagman: Now N has values to do something|pg||
nt|hedyg: David when your pd shows a strong hand an ace, a king and Qx in pds suit is not a lot?|pg||
nt|bagman: X or 3@S|pg||
nt|bagman: depending on agreements on X|pg||
nt|lesniak: dobrze wykonane|pg||
nt|bagman: S had already shown a fine @D suit. Now it was time to show some support for partner|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|dougdscsu: Bas is god|pg||
nt|hedyg: oh my|pg||
nt|mamos: 3Nt coming|pg||
nt|marlowepi: for most of us, not an appetizing approach to describing the E hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is played from the other side |pg||
nt|andyv:  10 more imps for Bulgaria is Italy stopped at 3@d on board 5|pg||
pc|s5|nt|brgpro: my guess is: 2@d=extra length or Bal. min. and 2@h asked which, 2@s showed the later|pg||
nt|brolucius: An initial response of 3@C would be 8-11 natural.|pg||
nt|jtr: It needs very specific cards facing a weak NT which i imagine Bocchi has shown by now|pg||
nt|jtr: Madala is maybe just looking for the best game|pg||
nt|brolucius: It would be quite a system triumph to identify that you were CLOSE to a slam. |pg||
nt|brgpro: the perfect card S can find is: xx  KQx xxxxx Akx|pg||
nt|brolucius: xx/Axxx/AKx/Qxxx also good.|pg||
nt|brgpro: that isn't that min....he might rebid 2NT with that|pg||
nt|brgpro: now he is on the corss road...go beyond 3NT or not...|pg||
nt|jtr: I imagine 2@d showed the weak NT with 2NT showing something else  Common methods which i myself use|pg||
nt|brolucius: The convention card says 2NT rebid is 12-14 balanced but may not be bid with x-x in a suit. Here he has a low doubleton spade.|pg||
nt|jtr: I cant see that David|pg||
nt|brgpro: so 2NT asked his weakness and 3@s showed it?|pg||
nt|brolucius: At the end of the notes - last section.|pg||
nt|jtr: ah!|pg||
nt|jtr: Wow you are efficient!|pg||
nt|brolucius: In fact 2NT rebid is 11-14 balanced, with no low doubleton.|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am spurred into action by the presence of top-class commentators alongside.|pg||
nt|hedyg: lucky to find K@H with 3 @ss|pg||
nt|atabey: so it was unbeatable afterall. the lead didnt matter|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Fayad values the hand as stronger than Versace did in othr room .. but they still stop short of game|pg||
nt|capercliff: maybe its Lauria's turn to only claim 10?:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: esp when opps can bid spades, highly likely when u r short there, your main suit can get buried|pg||
nt|mamos: no double because it asked for a spade nd here Spade holder on lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: but he found the lead |pg||
nt|Gerben42: only the best graduate from the Blue Team bridge school|pg||
nt|barnets: well clearly north likes to bid a lot|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Some play XX here instead of 3@H has an invite to 4@H so that 3@H can be used for competition, or just push opps out|pg||

nt|brolucius: The Bocchi-Madala convention card is available at:  http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/May/OpenTeams/italy/bocchi-madala.pdf|pg||
nt|brgpro: finally he dicided to cross the boarder|pg||
nt|jtr: Ah of course, they cant have 18-19 balanced|pg||
nt|sharkey: The way this match is going may also influence NS bidding here|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't think EW need to speculate|pg||
nt|petergill: Janis Ozols likes to compete, as we saw earlier on a hand that cost 5 imps|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: EW amazed at dummy|pg||
nt|gulyas: this another 2 imps to HUN, regardless of making 5 or 6|pg||
pc|d7|nt|Walddk2: A Gazzilli sequence got them to the 3-level|pg||
nt|Walddk2: was impossible for Madala to stop short after that|pg||
nt|schtsch: woohoo|pg||
nt|schtsch: the lead is set|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: N had no reason to move over 3N|pg||
pc|d5|nt|bagman: Here Sementa is unlikely to drop the @CK|pg||
nt|hedyg: J@H works well here|pg||
nt|skorchev: Bulgaria won 10 imps in board 5, since Madala-Bocchi stopped at 3@D+2 ... (5@D= was played here)|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|jtr: They open 2@c with that|pg||
nt|brgpro: i think 4NT shows odd number of key cards....i played a lot of Italian pairs, still dont quite understand their turbo method|pg||
nt|brolucius: If anyone bid and made 6@D against me on these cards, I would think that I was not destined to win the match.|pg||
nt|hedyg: lets try not to exaggerate :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: wudnt bet on it....:)|pg||
nt|bagman: If he ever gets to dummy|pg||
nt|sybarra: I would hard pressed to find a low sp lead from the N holding |pg||
nt|petergill: He is a passed hand, so he knew if partner passed the Dbl that it would be OK|pg||
nt|barnets: not surprised|pg||
nt|snetram:  ale zagrania dwa razy atu- poÅÄczone z impasem - wygrywa|pg||
nt|koksoy: @S R lead  overtaken by  A  and  diamond  ...  now??  decision  time|pg||
nt|bagman: South might guess this; the defense would have played 2 rounds of spades if there was need for @D finesse|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|s4|nt|bagman: he might be forced to|pg||

nt|april7: because of the X W might finesse for the 10 first round or second round|pg||
pc|s8|nt|brgpro: not that bad...only a little less than 50% slam...|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, it's not a bad slam particularly but difficult to bid, as you said earlier.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://psbridge.gotdns.com/bbo/allvug/  - Vugraph Hand Records (PDF)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: lol thanks all (and Doug)|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: It was actually (again!) someone coming in for the BM|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I should just gag them...|pg||
nt|bagman: Now @H + spade guarantees set if E has Qxx of diamonds|pg||
nt|schtsch: sorry for this cheering, we are watching football and i got carried away|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|brolucius: If you don't play a two-suited 2@S, then many would open a normal weak 2@S on that North hand.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Correction, the minor can be four cards only|pg||
nt|brolucius: Anyway, it seems that they had a splendid investigative auction and decided, very reasonably, to stay out of it.|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: In Pairs it might've been easier, raising 5@D to 6@D because it's bad score anyway :)|pg||
nt|daman: he need to play a @S or a @D|pg||
pc|dK|nt|daman: s|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can be pretty sure the @DA is right|pg||
nt|hedyg: S thought pd had singleton @S not to raise to 3@s|pg||
pc|d8|nt|bagman: Sementa probably reasoned that N must have the @CK to pass|pg||
nt|sharkey: still need to locate a few honors yet so too early to play for drop|pg||
nt|bagman: And so far, he really cannot draw inferences from the nyances in S's defensive play|pg||

nt|athene: yes but that's irrelevant - leading to the nine is just as bad as leading to the queen|pg||
nt|drorp: italians win 8 when Bocchi chooses not to transfer on board 7|pg||
pc|h2|nt|capercliff: im told to say "certifiable":)|pg||
nt|rodvenn: 5 @c was a much better contract on 7 than 3NT. Deserved to gain|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: There's an orchestra practising just on the other side of a wall here|pg||
nt|babs59: I would have thought West would continue the trump attack|pg||
nt|corplaw: 10 imps for croatia|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|daman: yes|pg||
nt|athene: firstly @SAK @DA is 1@S not 2@S|pg||
pc|cK|nt|atabey: kolata did not dbl 2@h. which I believe was a better move. and he earned 5 imps|pg||
nt|athene: secondly with the @DA north would be more likely to just clear the spades|pg||
nt|rodvenn: the 6 points on 5 is also well deserved to Italy, but the 10imps on 1 is slightly lucky|pg||
pc|c3|nt|bagman: Now south wanted the @ST back|pg||

nt|bagman: West cannot believe that S has Axx of clubs|pg||
pc|c2|nt|bagman: Technically and in isolation, declarer should have lead @HJ to pick up KTx onside. Here, however, the @HJ was needed to guard against diamond overruf|pg||
nt|marlowepi: once W bids the suit you have to lead a low one at IMPs|pg||
nt|wstuart: not until he cashes his @CA  :)|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|schtsch: trump promotion|pg||
nt|schtsch: not needed though|pg||
nt|athene: this will surely be a loss - maybe small loss against 3@S, maybe big loss against 4@S making|pg||
nt|athene: the best they can hope for is a flat board against 4@S-1|pg||
pc|h5|nt|hedyg: and a @c back|pg||
nt|brolucius: After a club lead (against that 5@D doubled), declarer simply drew trumps and set up a club winner in the South hand to pitch the spade loser from dummy.|pg||
nt|paulg:  not an easy situation to read|pg||
pc|h6|nt|athene: ok, he isn't risking the contract for an overtrick|pg||
nt|athene: fair enough|pg||
nt|hedyg: why not K@H before @s finesse?|pg||
nt|gulyas: just plain Dumbovich, getting everything right|pg||
nt|ziff:  More or less the same defence at both tables|pg||
pc|hA|nt|Vugraphznk: Declarer took a finesse from dummy, but I have no clue how...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: too unlikely that partner has 2 tricks of his own|pg||
nt|barnets: in the open north was content with just 1 X|pg||
nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@h on a @s lead would have been (only just) -1, but the 4@S overcall at this vulnerability is normal|pg||
nt|toral5: ll cross ruff the rest|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|hedyg: he could have played the 9|pg||

pc|d2|pc|dQ|pc|dA|pg||
nt|daman: I suspect this will take a careful anaysis|pg||
nt|paulg:  another clue is that NS have found a 4-3 heart fit and still decided to play notrump|pg||

pc|hJ|pc|hK|pc|hA|pg||

nt|brolucius: The teams are divided into two sections that each play a round-robin. The top teams will advance to a second round-robin, where they will not replay against opponents they have ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: already faced.|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: Haha, people are asking me for Group B RS as well, but this laptop has no Flash player so I can't access the EBL website...|pg||
nt|jtr: As i said, in keeping with transfer responses|pg||
nt|athene: this was west's 4@S, i presume|pg||
nt|bjacobs: As a passed hand, I think you are worth 2@S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@D also possible, but the spades look good|pg||
nt|mbruun: You just turned 20 last week. Youre getting more sensible on your older days|pg||
nt|mdgraham: after all, they are solid|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Partner usually has 4 spades when he doubles 1@H, but not always as we see|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In an ideal world he has|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Still, this 4-3 fit is fairly harmless.  And if partner has extras, he will bid, and I can show my heart stopper next|pg||
nt|bjacobs: North thinking here is an overbid|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it's not an ideal world, even though it's the only one we've got|pg||
nt|mbruun: I dont think you should interfer over 1 H with the North hand after partner passed. Game is highly unlikely, and partner can still bidd with good distibution|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Wow|pg||
nt|sybarra: I would 1 @S  but my better suit is @D's here |pg||
nt|mbruun: I just turned 21 yesterday|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Aren't you going to lose a lot of partscores if you pass 1@H with that North hand?|pg||

nt|barnets: east opened a toy 2@D showing 9 cards in majors|pg||
nt|Gerben42: esp. since NS can make 3@D|pg||
nt|petergill: and West did well not to get excited|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Looks like it|pg||

nt|drorp: so it can go 3@D-P-P-X|pg||
nt|drorp: to find it|pg||
nt|atabey: 2@s probably some sort of unballenced inverted|pg||
mb|2D!|an|GF|nt|paulg:  watching online you would always think that Wilkinson is the old man of the partnership|pg||
nt|fabsayc: what is 3@C|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Minimum|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@D asking for shortage I believe, not sure|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: With NS overcalling style, the S hand would be considered a maximum, right?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well not a minimum for sure|pg||
nt|bagman: S hoping that the @HK is with length|pg||
nt|hedyg: their CC says they play Ghestem|pg||
nt|barnets: west bid 2@S and that was that|pg||
nt|bagman: This should be fast -2 on a spade lead|pg||
nt|yuval10: lead @s and E naturally play the Q, easy 9 tricks|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true|pg||

mb|3C|nt|brolucius: The Open Room results are not being updated on my MOVIE, but I am told that... Iceland made 4@s in 8, and played 3NT+2 in 9|pg||

nt|atabey: 2@d will be final contract|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Scuzi|pg||
nt|mbruun: I just dont like that pattern|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: No one likes a 4333 except for when the opps have one|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The textbooks say that you have one heart too many and one spade too few for a take-out double|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I wrote it myself in 1991|pg||
nt|bjacobs: But "those who can, do, those who can't, write the textbooks"|pg||
nt|capercliff: that is a funny Question, which one is the junior:)|pg||

nt|Walddk4: What about Chandler's Ford, David?|pg||
nt|atabey: oops|pg||
nt|othered1: I must have the wrong convention card for NS.  It calls for 1@C opening on south's hand.|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: This is interesting|pg||
nt|hedyg: nobody forces Zorlu to anything|pg||
nt|athene: this is unlikely to make|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: ... Lavazza girls ... lol|pg||
nt|daman: serbia gained 12 on Board 9    Italy never got to game in the OR|pg||
nt|daman: he can make this.......double dummy|pg||
nt|athene: the multi-2@D has definitely been outscoring the natural 2@S opener this match|pg||
nt|daman: yes|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Serbia leading Italy by 24 with 9 compared boards, who would've though|pg||
nt|athene: despite common claims that it can't be better to allow opps so much more room|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that never stopped the Italians, and it doesn't seem to do them any harm |pg||
nt|rodvenn: also the board 8 shows better judgement and system by the Italians. |pg||
nt|sharkey: Slovakia off the Schneider??|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, 1NT looks OK.|pg||
nt|sharkey: 1 NT by N may be an alternative as well|pg||
nt|bagman: North hasn't made this, yet|pg||
nt|marlowepi: spade natural lead|pg||
nt|brolucius: 5@D was the obvious move if South does decide to advance.|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Wouldn't this be a 2@D overcall then?|pg||
nt|iain sime: My experience is the same as David's.|pg||
nt|hedyg: no Bas|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now he only needs to maake it|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I thought 3@C two highest remaining, cuebid two most extreme and 2NT the two lowest|pg||
nt|athene: 3@C from sementa showing less than 8 hcp|pg||
nt|gulyas: same spot, and a likely push|pg||
nt|athene: both sides played it from the singleton hand|pg||
nt|athene: as no-one ever bids clubs to mean clubs these days|pg||
mb|3D|nt|marlowepi: sometimes you catch Txxxxx with partner and 22. or you may find Axxxx|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@d would be majors|pg||
nt|cicus: and, incidentally, both rooms played the contract from the south hand|pg||
nt|gulyas: OR cos of prec 1@C, and Gazilli here|pg||
nt|cicus: hmm, I should write shorter sentences|pg||
nt|athene: declarer's only decision is whether to try @SAKQ for a diamond discard|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: lol|pg||
nt|athene: i thinky you probably do|pg||
nt|athene: think|pg||
nt|andyv:  a claimer for 5... I wonder what the alert was for.  Maybe NS play NAMYATS|pg||
nt|ziff:  Versace probably is a bit nervous about @D Kx, but he can t right-side the contract anyway, and his partner has the right cards for him|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West will be pleased to see a non-@DQ opening lead|pg||
nt|petergill: On Bd 6, 6@S would be a wonderful contract to reach. Nobody has bid 6@S so far. Here is Group B's scores on Bd 6 http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/runningsc...|pg||
nt|petergill: ores/asp/BoardacrossCondit.asp?qboard=006.18..820|pg||
nt|rv: some also play 3@s on double shows @d stopper in addition to 4@s+5@h|pg||
nt|drorp: X with 9 majors and unbalanced hand when they kinda showed big diamond fit can hardly be wrong, according to the LAW|pg||
mb|p|nt|atabey: haha|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: lol, he had 2@D out of the box and on the table|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Sorry, I thought he had opened 1@H|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hard to only make 4 here|pg||
nt|drorp: and on this case it will reward as both 3@S and 3@D make|pg||
nt|atabey: well done by ballancing. 3@s is a good spot for NS|pg||
nt|drorp: who's thinking? and why?|pg||
nt|atabey: maybe it was not a good decision for versace to open in 3rd seat. it might go passed out|pg||
nt|athene: lauria was surely the only person who might have anything to think about over 3@S|pg||
mb|3N|nt|brolucius: Is there some other method?|pg||
nt|lesniak: tak, szczegolnie biorac pod uwage cienkie wejscia Bal|pg||
nt|antoniz: Twoje pere³ki s¹ piekne:)|pg||
nt|barnets: perhaps south could have XX instead of 1N|pg||
nt|barnets: that would hav enabled north to compete higher|pg||
nt|petergill: Good point, XX to suggest doubleton support and values would have helped North compete to 3@D|pg||

nt|bagman: There are something like 6 to 7 losers|pg||
nt|sharkey: by no means no - the way the match has developed so far....|pg||
nt|bagman: Slovakia might get 5 IMPs but this can be also flat|pg||
nt|brolucius: Of course it would be foolish of East to double just because he has loads of points - an insult to the opponents (even if they were not Italian).|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He can, double dummy, but that is not the same as he will|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@d majors, 2NT @H+@C, 3@C @S+@C|pg||
nt|stc: @s is probably best play|pg||
nt|Walddk2: East is squeezed to pieces without the count|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Maybe we play different Ghestems :) So many modifications around these days|pg||
nt|brolucius: Many actual partnerships play different Ghestems, as Iain pointed out.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: See what happens to East if Bocchi cashes lots of trumps|pg||
nt|hedyg: he can drop the @ds?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But then Bocchi can set up spades in comfort|pg||
nt|stc: The last 6 cards are 3@c, 2@s and 1@d|pg||
nt|hedyg: so i think Mossop could have a played a higher card than the 6|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If East has no more diamonds|pg||
nt|hedyg: though*|pg||
nt|hedyg: any reason not to?|pg||
nt|athene: well you might sometimes run into a defensive crossruff where just drawing trumps worked better, but it's pretty unlikely|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer might hold up twice and then try to set up a heart|pg||

nt|yuval10: N wondering if 5@c is better probably|pg||

nt|toral5: @S ace wd ve changed the picture.agree wid yuval|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Stiff @S a big bother for N.|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: People who normally play the so-called convention "2-way checkback" utilise the 2NT response to the 1NT rebid as a puppet to 3@C, to show a shortage|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: disapointment, when dummy shows (and doubly so with the @CJ there)|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/May/OpenTeams/turkey/zorlu-assael.pdf|pg||
nt|mbruun: I would hesitate for 30 sec and pass. That shows 3343 and 15HCP in my system|pg||
nt|schtsch: so madala showing 54 or 44?|pg||
nt|schtsch: 1nt is 12-14 balanced?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Yes|pg||
nt|corplaw: 5N pick a slam, but S not sure what slam to pick|pg||
nt|corplaw: 6C, 6S and 6N all make with club position|pg||
nt|ahri: even 6@h could make :)|pg||
nt|schtsch: madala would like to pick 6@c but suit is not a great one|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I think South believes that given he's shown 45 already, how come partner didn't set clubs with 3@C's|pg||
nt|schtsch: enough, though|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: If South has 2434 it is also likely that he would bid 3NT over 2NT|pg||
nt|schtsch: correct, so he is marked with 2425|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Since 2NT over 2@H would most likely deny 4 clubs|pg||
nt|athene: wow ok i stand corrected|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Walddk4: I thought that range died in the 60's|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: lol, I was referring to group B running scores :)|pg||
nt|athene: if you allow them more room in tricky, complicated situations, it can work out very well when they get their shoelaces tangled up|pg||
nt|athene: anyway we will discover the best line of play in a moment, because duboin will choose it :)|pg||

nt|hedyg: looking at dummy @d is his only chance!|pg||
nt|stc: a BIG point now|pg||
nt|iain sime: This doesn't work if a diamond is played. The squeeze would have worked- East had to keep all his black cards so declarer could have given up a spade.|pg||
nt|hedyg: he is going for giving 3@cs and 1@d|pg||
nt|gulyas: he will make an overtrick, unless E plays a @D now|pg||

nt|andyv:  E would like to get into this auction but it will be difficult for him|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Yes, you could argue that both N/S's bid correctly - one after the 1@H opening, the other after the weak 2|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: You were right Mike, the tables have turned ;)|pg||
nt|capercliff: well it will be positive for Italy anyway|pg||
nt|brolucius: Good gracious. Is that 1@S contract over already?!|pg||
nt|sharkey: Going into 2nd half on an upbeat note :)|pg||
nt|bagman: This looks like a flat 450 at both tables :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Slovakia need to pick up another 11 IMPs to make a dent in the maximum VP defeat. |pg||
nt|bagman: He was probably happy to have to guess only for the overtrick|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Strange, everyone says -1 but I'm sure the play went as it went...|pg||
nt|hedyg: then he is down immediately|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't think so, Constantin|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is part of the odds of bidding such slams (and well done for bidding it) that the defenders may not be card perfect. It was a tricky one for East.|pg||
nt|stc: E must play @s|pg||
nt|iain sime: Win the lead and play all the trumps would have worked.|pg||
nt|stc: if he ducks the @d E must play @s to beat|pg||
nt|brolucius: East had no idea at all how the diamond suit lay.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It won't help East to come down to 2 spades, 1 diamond and 3 clubs. Then declarer can ruff out the clubs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: There was a legitimate line |pg||
nt|Walddk2: But a little easier for us|pg||
nt|petergill: South had 2 losing choices, give partner a ruff and miss out on @D tricks, or takes winners. He chose the latter|pg||
nt|petergill: Half time, and Latvia are holding the mighty Italy well |pg||
nt|Gerben42: as they have done the other favorites of the group|pg||
nt|gulyas: maybe|pg||
nt|athene: good solid result from the other room on this one, will surely be duplicated|pg||
nt|koksoy: Ýtaly  gained 2 swings at  the  same contract|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: In Namyats, wouldn't this be a 4@D opening?|pg||
nt|andyv:  it would except that the hand was pretty weak in hcp|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I'd probably open 1@S and rebid 4@S, showing a really good suit with too much on the side to open 4@S|pg||
nt|babs59: yes I would too|pg||

nt|hedyg: while the Italians stop playing?|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: So you werent tempted to venture some of your 'hard' earned dosh?:)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3nt overcall?|pg||
nt|jbgood: multi, 2@s would have shown 8-11 hcp and 6 cards|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4S easier to make than to bid|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 4@S is one too high, though|pg||
nt|andyv:  a very strong NT|pg||
nt|paulg:  Denning with a Meckwell-style 1@d opener, is there a worse 11 points?|pg||
nt|andyv:  but you are right...4@s would show about 7 tricks and 4@d (namyats) would show about 7.5 to 8 tricks|pg||
nt|babs59: some believe Namyats should have more control of outside suits than that hand - eg singleton in one of the 'less stopped' suits|pg||
nt|athene: 2@C overcall over 1@D causes a lot of problems |pg||
nt|athene: very easy to miss major-suit fits or find bad ones|pg||
nt|toral5: @H partial coming up|pg||
nt|yuval10: will W reopen?|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|gulyas: as I said before so many times, a likely push:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|brgpro: i dont mind opeing 3@d with the S cards although we were taught not to do so|pg||
nt|daman: if they can get there|pg||
nt|rodvenn: or on board 8 a misundeerstanding: the double of the 2@S splinter bid howed spades. But Svendsen seem tu have thought it was an OD, showing hearts|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Hoftaniska asked me to call the TD|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Not sure what it was all about|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: He seemed to want Bocchi to tell the TD what he told him. The TD just told Hofta to stop...|pg||
nt|bagman: I've been wrong before, though, in my estimates|pg||
nt|antoniz: jak wysoko dojad¹?|pg||
nt|barnets: In his earlier days young Madala would have opened 4@S as would many- now he opened 1@S and got a plus|pg||
nt|athene: interesting choice of overcall - 1nt was definitely an option there|pg||
nt|gulyas: or dbl|pg||
nt|cicus: E had many choices here, including X and 1NT|pg||
nt|schtsch: 2@c something|pg||
nt|athene: here for example north has to double, because he isn't strong enough for 2@S|pg||
mb|p!|nt|hedyg: i dont like the 2@H bid :(|pg||
nt|hedyg: what is wrong with 2NT?|pg||
nt|brolucius: If Hedy and I would both rebid 2NT it must be right.|pg||
nt|bagman: It all depends on their methods. Playing standardish 2@H is wrong but here we do not know.|pg||
nt|hedyg: :) ty David|pg||
nt|sharkey: I think we all wud join in|pg||
nt|Gerben42: I guess if the Blue Team school told him not to, perhaps we all should listen ?|pg||
nt|bagman: Yes, if no aces :)|pg||
mb|d!|nt|brolucius: Italya are more likely to win this than England are to beat Slovenia in the World Cup and England are '2-to-1 on'.|pg||
nt|othered1: here 6@D is OK with @C lead and excellent without it.|pg||
nt|atabey: never reachable 6@d|pg||
nt|hedyg: slam in @d is on IF he finds Q@s|pg||
nt|bagman: This looks like a quiet push in 1NT|pg||
nt|snetram:  bardzo obrotowe rozdanie|pg||
nt|bagman: Without any other knowledge running the @H9 is correct as A/Q offside are equal but 9 takes care of the AQx|pg||

nt|athene: bidding it might be another matter|pg||
nt|atabey: but why doesnt he bid his hearts? italian systems very good but this one is not that good|pg||
nt|yuval10: yes he does|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  you do need some parameters to make the bid meaningful|pg||
nt|rv: no entry to East hand to push @s through|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|othered1: is north worth 3@D in their methods?  That could get south interested?|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@c is transfer|pg||
nt|bagman: This should have been a quiet push :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  Hi Pekka:)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I never said that - it was Mathias :)|pg||
nt|rodvenn: so there may have been a wrong explanation to Svendsen ... |pg||
nt|fabsayc: this auction strange, did west really pass 2@H|pg||
nt|fabsayc: diamond suit blocked|pg||
nt|ahri: i am not sure if 6@s was played in best manner, if east held KQx clubs and 4 hearts with jack, bocchi killed his squeeze by playing 3 rounds of hearts first|pg||
nt|athene: if you decided that north had four hearts for his double, and you had to play the heart suit for no losers, you would have to play for the drop |pg||
nt|athene: you can't pick up @HQxxx with north, only @HQx with south|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Like a moment for a horror film. Strangely, the bookies have maintained exactly the same odds for England still to win the World Cup. 8/1 fourth favourites.|pg||
nt|bagman: Balancing against 1x-1y-1NT is quite dangerous business as the opps know what they have|pg||

mb|3C!|nt|bagman: and often have no fit|pg||
nt|bagman: With his late X, East has indicated heart values|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Oh, sorry Mathias :)|pg||
nt|antoniz: na trafieniu kara 12 lew|pg||
nt|barnets: good reason|pg||
nt|andyv:  another 3N hand|pg||
nt|babs59: yes, so maybe @HAx  and Dx  instead - giving more controls|pg||
nt|ahri: i might be overseeing something though|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 1 club honour onside = 75% though, with the added chance of hearts 3-3 or 4-2 with @HJx|pg||
nt|atabey: a fake 3@s is coming I guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Nor have they improved Argentina's odds, despite them looking so strong. Roland will explain the betting on the Denmark team.|pg||
nt|mbruun: First quarter 46-0 for Italy, second quarter 8-0 for Lithuania, now its time for the third|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That's a good stop ... it's a tempting hand, but the lack of aces is crucial|pg||
nt|hedyg: and the lead is....directed!|pg||
nt|brolucius: In the old days 1@D - 3@S would show the North hand. Now it is usually used as a splinter bid agreeing diamonds.|pg||
nt|hedyg: disc @c on @d and claim when that works for 11 tricks|pg||
nt|bagman: NS' system card states: NAT: maybe reverse bids|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am told that in Poland a 2NT rebid denies four hearts.|pg||
nt|snetram:  kara trzeba grac na impas|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: a 13?|pg||

mb|p|nt|othered1: how strong a  hand has north shown and how many @D?|pg||
nt|andyv:  agree... fighting against 90 is fine in match points... in imps it can be costly|pg||

nt|pasker: N/S should be able to escape to 2@D here|pg||
nt|pasker: Some people play 1NT as a stronger hand in this position as you can just pass with a weak nt having already opened the bidding|pg||
nt|bagman: Sout has values to compete|pg||
nt|athene: i guess his reasoning was, partner can still bid 3@S over 3@H if he has four|pg||
nt|cicus: probably|pg||
nt|athene: with 5 spades and 4 hearts you would be more inclined to double 3@D, i think|pg||

nt|hedyg: ohhhhhhhh|pg||
nt|bagman: proven wrong again :(|pg||
nt|hedyg: they cannot afford to throw tricks away like this|pg||
nt|brolucius: I don't really see the value in such a method because North can introduce hearts over a 2NT rebid. Meanwhile, South has given an excellent description of his hand.|pg||
nt|sharkey: the @H reverse distorts the S hand as well|pg||
nt|hedyg: definitely|pg||
nt|sharkey: unless that's their agreement|pg||
nt|bagman: There are multiple structures a bidding system can be built on. I don't think that we have the competence to analyze them all|pg||
nt|hedyg: a reverse should show shape as well as strength|pg||
nt|brolucius: Well, if it does include this type, in the system, it certainly creates a less accurate description of the hand. |pg||

nt|athene: the main point is not the six-card diamond suit so much as the double of 2@C from north|pg||
nt|athene: we know he hasn't got many points for it so we might be more inclined to play him for the right shape|pg||
nt|athene: i.e. length in both majors|pg||
nt|april7: and since the 4th Q cannot be finessed E might finess S for that card|pg||
nt|atabey: he wont play for the drop thats for sure|pg||
nt|toral5: sd escape 4 100 if he inserts @D 10|pg||
nt|toral5: buth @H ace instead of a @C wd ve secured 300|pg||
nt|yuval10: Q@d will be enough|pg||
nt|toral5: infact  q is corrct.cos he can pitch dummys @D on @S|pg||
nt|yuval10: then @s finesse|pg||
nt|toral5: yes|pg||
nt|toral5: he knows @S king is off|pg||
nt|toral5: and @D on.so betr is q now|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|marlowepi: play blacks exit Ds|pg||
pc|d3|nt|iceblue: I think W didnt know which was better, 2@S or 3@S, then he desided to PASS|pg||

nt|skorchev: the first duck (@S) wouldn't be a good idea if @ds were 3-1|pg||
nt|fabsayc: of both aces offside|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|brolucius: East has to calculate whether it is worth rising with the @HQ to get West to draw dummy's last trump.|pg||
nt|atabey: usually zorlu has very good instincts|pg||
nt|hedyg: OR stopped in 5@d|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: So he'll cash @SAK Yalcin? :)|pg||
nt|atabey: but this very hard |pg||
nt|paulg:  Piper is easily the best declarer in the Scotland team ... practice makes perfect|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Haha|pg||
nt|capercliff: im not sure he can get this right, is there a case to playing the double @d finesse instead of low to the J?|pg||
nt|hedyg: was there a case to play @c?|pg||
nt|hedyg: i thought that was risky|pg||
nt|hedyg: he needs the @ds for his contract|pg||
nt|capercliff: i dont think the defence can stop 9 tricks as it happens|pg||
nt|rodvenn: Hofta realised he could not beat the contract|pg||
nt|snetram:  ma jeszcze czas przez dwie lewy|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|brolucius: I checked the instructions on my various packets of heart pills and they made no mention of taking an extra dose before England world cup matches.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if N has stiff heart ace, that line would make|pg||
nt|bagman: Now declarer has no time to get that long heart|pg||
pc|s6|nt|fabsayc: or|pg||
pc|s5|nt|bagman: This is still likely to make: often defense might set up 6th trick in trumps but here declarer has the spots |pg||
nt|brolucius: As often happens, the Italians used 10 bids where the Slovakians thought that 4 were enough. Once in a while, the longer auction would diagnose a good slam, so the extra work can ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: pay off.|pg||
nt|hedyg: so he could have played J@d, then a @s to the 8|pg||
nt|stc: What is the %play in trump here ? I think small to the 9 sligthly better|pg||
nt|brolucius: Iain makes a good point about 11-14 being too large a range to cover accurately.|pg||
nt|Gerben42: at least 3@S wouldnt have been let through here either :)|pg||
nt|babs59: interesting - with no @D at trick 2, North would play the @C the other way, for safety|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The winning contract was probably 1NT.  It could be reached if, for example, West opens 1NT|pg||
nt|bagman: anyhow a flat 450, wasn't it|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I was told 11, but corrected to 10 now|pg||
nt|bagman: ok|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok ty Bas|pg||
nt|paulg:  excellent defence that will set up the spade trick as the seventh defensive trick|pg||
pc|dK|nt|Vugraphznk: Lauria is pretty disgruntled. Has been like that since the 3NTX|pg||
pc|dA|nt|atabey: wd|pg||
pc|d6|nt|hedyg: see? instincts!|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s2|nt|iceblue: why not cover 7 or 8?|pg||
nt|bagman: and the trumps are 3-3|pg||
nt|andyv:  only 50 a trick|pg||
nt|mamos: did colin really double?|pg||
nt|bagman: N really should have gone and played the spade|pg||
nt|bagman: Unless he could count for surely that S has KJx|pg||
pc|sA|nt|hedyg: was there a case for playing Q@S?|pg||
nt|mamos: any one see why?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he thinks he is zia?|pg||
nt|sybarra: recorded as X but not sure why|pg||
nt|schtsch: obviously madala didn't think so|pg||
nt|schtsch: great double from bocchi|pg||
nt|schtsch: but created problems|pg||
pc|s3|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|ryskiel_: posluszny|pg||
pc|s9|nt|Vugraphznk: Too late|pg||
pc|dT|nt|babs59: but once you have the @D trick, instead you play the @C from North to keep East off lead|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe he thought playing in 4/4 fit, and pard had a trumps? |pg||
nt|toral5: so 100 here 4 iceland|pg||
pc|sT|nt|andyv:  Bulgaria on a roll as they set 3@h in OR for 5 more imps on board 6|pg||
nt|toral5: @C king and @D jack?|pg||
nt|toral5: nope.100 only|pg||
mc|8|nt|bagman: Now he's ok|pg||

mb|p|nt|fabsayc: if partner is that bad at leading, i get a new partner :)|pg||
nt|paulg:  it is more likely to push Haraldsson into thinking his partner's values are elsewhere and working|pg||
nt|paulg:  not much space to investigate though|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 5nt?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: problem though if partner shows spade king, no club king|pg||

nt|bagman: against potential 130 at the other table|pg||
nt|petergill: Gains if partner has bare ace left, and also prevents partner from thinking you have put him on lead for the 4th @D|pg||
nt|Gerben42: I'm starting to see the point about EW being among the world's best cardplayers|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: As just did the other players|pg||
nt|gulyas: Italy down in a slam in the OR|pg||
nt|gulyas: chance for a swing again|pg||
nt|athene: not a great 6@H as you have a diamond to get rid of as well as the trump suit to negotiate, but not that bad|pg||
nt|athene: double dummy it makes of course - as does 7@S|pg||
nt|cicus: how would you play it on  a@D lead?|pg||
nt|hedyg: as does 6NT then|pg||
nt|hedyg: i think not even Roland would bid it|pg||
nt|athene: i am not sure how you actually do play it|pg||
nt|gulyas: this surely is a Roland slam|pg||
nt|hedyg: no, Roland slams are 12.89%|pg||
nt|gulyas: oh, sry:)|pg||
nt|athene: the big question is whether you play a trump to the ten - gains against small singleton with north, of course, but loses on lots of other layouts|pg||
nt|andyv:  so far 27 unanswered points|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hungary beat italy last night|pg||

nt|bagman: true, but even in that case @HQ and spade would have been correct|pg||

nt|antoniz: proszê , by przeciwnicy zaczêli trochê trykaæ:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well it wasnt a terribly confident auction, but still...opps are NV which means smaller penalty and also less likelihood EW have done something very overambitious|pg||
nt|brolucius: As I have mentioned before. Marc Smith tells me that in his system there is no way to avoid 3NT with 11 opposite 11. The responding hand raises the 2NT rebid to 3NT, in case opener ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: has 14. But he claims that such 22-point 3NT contracts are usually made. Not when I try it! |pg||
nt|hedyg: V/L play 1@s as 10-21 and Versace did NOT open!|pg||
nt|cicus: spades must come in anyway if you lose a trump so best seems a small trump to the 10|pg||
nt|athene: on a diamond lead you don't want to risk them knocking out the dummy entry which you might need for the spades|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes... we were trying to remember when last time Italy lost back to back matches|pg||
nt|petergill: 6@C, 6@S and 6NT are all playable, but how can North know that South has @C9, or South know that North has @C10? Too tough.|pg||
nt|athene: 5@C sac not so bad here|pg||
nt|atabey: the way to 4@h was also ugly :)|pg||
nt|drorp: 4@S from S seems normal, he has a 6 card fit but his hand is balanced so it's not like he's under bidding or anything like that, W will probably sacrifice over that|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  at adverse vulnerability and a spade void, i'd be very nervous opening a strong 1@c|pg||
nt|paulg:  what level will the bidding be at when it gets back to me?|pg||
nt|toral5: finally a grand coming up|pg||
mb|1N!|nt|brgpro: seems it showed @s |pg||

nt|andy_h: 2@D is "trash multi", which is like a weak 2 except the strength is 2-7 and can be a 5 card suit|pg||
nt|xenya: deaja vu of sorts -- if NS bid 6@H or 6N, they will make it|pg||
nt|jbgood: Brogeland is in 6 hearts in the OR|pg||
nt|andy_h: This will allow 2M openings to be 8-11 which can be destructive and constructive in nature.  If you have ever come across those 6M with 10hcp that doesn't deem worthy of a 1M or a ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: 2M opening, then having the 2M=8-11 really helps|pg||
nt|rodvenn: qj of spades maybe a worry for Bocchi|pg||
nt|xenya: but 6@C will be problematic|pg||
nt|sharkey: For those who want to study Lohay-Henc system you find it here : http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/May/OpenTeams/slovakia/henc-lohay.pdf|pg||
nt|brolucius: Hedy has to allow time for a restaurant lunch before the Portugal-Brazil game. |pg||
nt|bagman: Nothing works for EW on this hand. Luckily they are nv|pg||
nt|sybarra: quite a lead directing over call!|pg||
nt|petergill: It looks simple to do this, but it is not|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@D Precision, 11-15|pg||
nt|athene: well, you might just bash out @HAK and then hope to ruff spades down with the diamond as entry|pg||
nt|athene: it perhaps depends whether you get a club or diamond lead|pg||
nt|hedyg: in the mean time Hungary is in 12th position|pg||
nt|gulyas: thats what I thought|pg||
nt|cicus: but the entry is important only if spades are 3-3 with Q offside|pg||
nt|andyv:  this one still has a lot of boards|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but in this type of event you treat it as one long match, since the objective is qualification|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: ciekawe, ¿e w otwartym Szwed nie zagra³ na wygranie gry tylko pokornie siê podda³ i zarobi³ 2 impy|pg||
nt|koksoy: 6@H  -1   is  my  guess...  |pg||
nt|bagman: N has good enough hand to bid 4NT or more for take out and then correct @C to diamonds|pg||
nt|paulg:  according to the CC, double is takeout emphasising the majors|pg||
nt|babs59: today has been our coldest (possibly South Australia's wettest) day of the year|pg||
nt|schtsch: he will bid it as 14-16|pg||
nt|rv: I presume we should ignore scores in brds 12 and 13, passed out doesn't make sense|pg||
nt|athene: versace going to follow up with 4nt over 4@S perhaps? i think with that suit disparity you want to insist on clubs|pg||
mb|p|nt|jkotor: mo¿e wist z dubla karo nie by³ mo¿liwy?|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|hedyg: (14)15-17 NT|pg||
nt|andyv:  W bid 3@S here and N dbld in OR|pg||
nt|andyv:  it can be expensive that one VP|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 3@S could be called enterprising, even NV vs V|pg||
nt|bagman: West has no defense and no distributional surprises|pg||
nt|andyv:  well within the Versace playbook:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: lol|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe it meant colors |pg||
nt|marlowepi: perhaps W pulled wrong card, meaning to bid 1H|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I'd love to play with Marc Smith in that case lol|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 6@H seems reasonable|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 3NT solid @D with too much on the side?|pg||
nt|petergill: 3NT = solid @D's and close to 15 points|pg||
nt|athene: yes, that's quite a small factor|pg||
nt|koksoy: as  both  red  suits divided 4-0  I think  he  can  not  make  slem|pg||
nt|bagman: With both reds breaking as they are, 5@H is the limit|pg||
nt|koksoy: 3 @H   --  5nt  ??|pg||
nt|bagman: They surely bid slam, though|pg||
nt|paulg:  may gain 3 imps even if you go down in 6@h|pg||
nt|paulg:  there will be a few 7@h on the scoresheet|pg||
nt|koksoy: may  be..|pg||
nt|bagman: Declare might make 6@H X against careless defense|pg||
nt|paulg:  Denning may splinter in clubs here|pg||
nt|bagman: N wins the black lead and plays @HJ not covered|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 6H is good defence against 6C|pg||
nt|koksoy: 5 nt  is an old  conventition called  Josephine which asks partner about trump  quality  for  garandslem|pg||
nt|bagman: True, but EW have to find that suit first|pg||
nt|petergill: NS's 1NT is 14-16, so the 1NT rebid was 11-13 (or a very good 10)|pg||
nt|ziff:  Probably|pg||
nt|rnmalik: wow a grand.|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Tarzan Precision at work|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Again 2NT to show a weak hand. Partner is expected to rebid 3@C on most shapes. A direct 3@C would have been stronger.|pg||
nt|andyv:  that's why 4 person teams rarely win... just too much bridge over a short period of time.|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|bagman: Against good opponents 3@S might help them more than hurt them|pg||
nt|rodvenn: 6@h is easier. then declarer can investigate the distribution|pg||
nt|xenya: same in 6N|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: jak prosisz Irlandczyków Antoni to po angielsku|pg||
nt|sybarra: or is it transfer to hts?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I can see a TD call coming here|pg||
nt|Gerben42: define "too much" pd hasnt promised much|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Too much for a gambling 3NT|pg||
nt|Gerben42: gives Romanovski a tough decision|pg||
nt|petergill: Janis Romanovski realised that his void in partner's suit was terrible for higher contracts - well done|pg||
nt|athene: it's a good advertisement for a) not leading a singleton trump and b) not leading a trump against a small slam|pg||
nt|gulyas: they do have all the controls in the pack|pg||
nt|athene: but i doubt north is going to lead a heart :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: all like 3@H?|pg||
nt|hedyg: i prefer 3NT|pg||
nt|gulyas: its a nice suit|pg||
nt|cicus: I do|pg||
nt|hedyg: is it?|pg||
nt|gulyas: but I can see 3NT as well|pg||
nt|hedyg: the problem is that pd does not have AK@C!|pg||
nt|athene: whether 3@H is a nice suit will depend on how declarer plays it :)|pg||
nt|gulyas: all the controls show towards a suit contract|pg||
nt|hedyg: so you show that|pg||
nt|hedyg: he is imposing @hs and the suit just isnt good enough for that|pg||
nt|cicus: E has a problem here, he would like to invite to 6@H|pg||
nt|schtsch: spade?|pg||
nt|schtsch: what happened to fourth best nowadays?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Interesting that Bocchi didn't overcall 1@H as 1@D promises 0@D|pg||
nt|wstuart: Bad Madala - no Madala bicuit tonight  lol|pg||
nt|toral5: 4 match pointers 7nt:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: Well, maybe West is prepared to play 4@h facing @hs?|pg||
nt|andyv:  and here it did help them in the OR to get to a thin game|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Landy over opponent's 1NT overcall :)|pg||
nt|mbruun: Trump lead is best for the defense. |pg||
nt|barnets: 6@H would have been better to spectate|pg||
nt|petergill: Entries are a bit awkward|pg||
nt|petergill: in 3NT|pg||
nt|Gerben42: too few high cards missing to really be in trouble though|pg||
nt|barnets: no he has 3@S 4@H a club and a few diamonds|pg||
nt|gulyas: with 12hcp, E may bid more than just 4@H|pg||

mb|3D!|an|3451|nt|hedyg: Piper loves to bid NT|pg||
nt|paulg:  i think you mean 'Piper loves to bid and play'|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Maybe not|pg||
nt|hedyg: well he cannot bid NT for sure|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@s rkc in @H?|pg||
nt|cicus: the dreaded 4@S ace ask|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 4@S must be KC asking|pg||
nt|gulyas: yes|pg||
nt|bagman: As Philippe pointed out, EW can make 6@C|pg||
nt|toral5: frm d score point of view,it ll b bad 4 d dutch.cos stil they trail EVEN if 7 is bid.|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Nowadays most people know where the name comes from, but does anyone want to try?|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: this looks like -1 to me|pg||
nt|daman: 3@Ds   2@Ss and a @H|pg||
nt|athene: slightly unusual that lauria-versace passed 2@D out|pg||
nt|athene: many pairs would be in a forcing situation after doubling a 1nt overcall|pg||
nt|daman: what do you think of a double of 2@D by South?|pg||
nt|athene: it's not the same as doubling a 1nt opener (even assuming you play that as strong) because here you know your side has the balance of the points|pg||
nt|athene: i assume NS play double as takeout and north didn't fancy it with such a threadbare hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 7/12 atm Paul|pg||
nt|hedyg: my version looked politer :)|pg||
nt|petergill: The play will be interesting, I think|pg||
nt|schtsch: of course, 1nt asks for passive lead|pg||
nt|rnmalik: We know how the cards are placed but who would risk. |pg||
mb|3S!|nt|Walddk4: Top spot when you have a heart loser|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Losing one trick in each suit|pg||
nt|brolucius: This would normally rate as an OK game, but East's 1NT overcall means that there will be a trump loser.|pg||
nt|iceblue: 2NT is LEB, xfers to 3@C|pg||
nt|brolucius: The re-opening double gives North at least three options (clubs, NT or penalty pass).|pg||
nt|brgpro: on @s lead, N has to go up the 10 to make this|pg||
nt|jtr: I hate giving my partner options:)|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is what lazy bidding-panel members describe as a 'flexible action'. (All readers groan immediately).|pg||
nt|bagman: After 3@S it's not possible for NS to stay in 3@C and they might have to bid game as N has enough to act|pg||
nt|bagman: If North is going to lead a heart against 3NT, he should lead a low|pg||
nt|brolucius: If they use ten bids this time too, they will surely get too high.|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Okay, maybe not 2-way... lol|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He suggested that he and I have a game soon. Maybe I should accept|pg||
nt|bagman: and they have actually the highest making contract|pg||
nt|koksoy: Nederlands-Slovakya  2-0|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: The last week has been really pleasurable here, but for two days (one of which is today) where it was overcast|pg||
nt|rv: 2@d seems to be artificial GF here|pg||
nt|cumino: 6NT here. There is squeeze in M but double squeeze position had worked if south had 3@H|pg||
nt|drorp: chose the wrong time to suddenly being conservative, this time a save would work quite well (only 2 off by double finnesing the diamond)|pg||
nt|athene: maybe versace hoping his partner has a strong hand with a spade trick|pg||
nt|toral5: so lot of hard work in last 7 brds|pg||
nt|toral5: 1nt is BETA here?|pg||
mb|p|nt|pasker: Lauria is probably giving a choice between 3NT and 4@S|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 1@D did show @H apparently|pg||
nt|brolucius: If any kibitzers are thinking of logging off, to enjoy the sunshine, I am told that they will miss one of the most spectacular distributional hands of all time, later in this set.|pg||
nt|paulg:  3@d was no doubt intended as a good raise, but the diamond raise makes it sound less like one|pg||
nt|ziff:  Hand doesn t lie very well for declarer. Control may become a problem|pg||
mb|4S!|nt|Walddk4: Top spot for N-S that is, 4@C for E-W|pg||
nt|othered1: Or maybe not. Concention card says what Hedy describes in 1N box, but 1@C box says it shows outside of NT range (11-13).  So which is it?|pg||
nt|bagman: A low heart can give declarer a problem|pg||
nt|gulyas: 0-3|pg||
nt|gulyas: @HQ?|pg||
nt|hedyg: now asking about Q@H|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i am not quite sure what 3@H showed, anybody know?|pg||
nt|toral5: control asking i mean?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I guess de Wijs is de master, but then what's 3@S instead of 3@H|pg||
nt|toral5: so 1@S showed some number of @H?|pg||
mb|p|nt|antoniz: nie jestem trójjêzyczny jak Ty-angielski , niemiecki i wspania³y polski:):)|pg||
nt|andyv:  @c lead when pd didn't dbl 2@c makes little sense since it's from shortness|pg||
nt|rv: 4n is quantitative from West w/o any agreed fit, possibly showing 18-19, East correctly declined with only 13 hcp and would have accepted with 14/15|pg||
nt|rv: East also knows West is short in @d with 4-4-1-4 and slam doesn't rate to play well with no source of tricks|pg||
mb|7D|nt|jtr: @d lead also gives the vital entry|pg||
nt|brgpro: and he will play @cA and @c i think|pg||
nt|brolucius: In case East or West has @CK-x-x.|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3NT+2 at the other table, I am told.|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: Are you slandering my intel?! :P|pg||
nt|daman: not so sure that was best|pg||
nt|antoniz: piêkne odejcie|pg||
nt|mamos: dont understand much about this hand|pg||
nt|brolucius: It will be nice to say: 'Well, yes, we did lose to Germany in the World Cup, but - against that - I enjoyed that big hand on BBO this morning.'|pg||
nt|Walddk2: England supporters are kindly requested not to have a look at the scoreline in the match against the Netherlands|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Half full glasses are better than the half empty ones|pg||
nt|stc: The problem here is if @c are 4-4 or not|pg||
nt|brolucius: Full glasses even better.|pg||
nt|cicus: 4@S gains in 1 out of 1000 and causes trouble on every 2nd hand|pg||
nt|gulyas: what do you mean?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: This makes sense because else 4@S by responder would be a @S cue and the strong hand would ask Aces, which doesn't make sense|pg||
nt|paulg:  I hate auctions where there is some doubt over the trump suit .. surely Denning would cue bid 5@c if he was certain about hearts?|pg||
nt|koksoy: what  is  1@C  double ??  can  it  be  majors ??|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: with the relays going on N had no information where EW were going. So the X was ok|pg||

nt|bagman: Declarer has entry problems|pg||
nt|skorchev: after the group stage they'll play less rounds per they (most often 2 rounds), so it isn't impossible to play 4-handed|pg||
nt|andyv:  I always admire auctions like this one where EW were not satisfied in just bidding 4@s but exhausted all possibilities for a slam.|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: I am told: 2@h=4@h or max w/o 4M  2@s = relay 3@c = 4@h/4m min. 3@d = asks minor 3@h = 4@c|pg||
nt|cicus: I hate 4@S ace ask for @Hs|pg||

nt|gulyas: I love it|pg||
nt|hedyg: why Gabor?|pg||
nt|hedyg: i love it too|pg||
nt|cicus: see above|pg||
nt|athene: i agree these tweaks to improve blackwood cause much more trouble than they save - it's like the difference betwenen 3014 and 1430|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Why Gabor?|pg||
nt|gulyas: he passes them too often:)|pg||
nt|petergill: The 3 declarers in Group B who have played 4@S so far have made it, with the clubs coming in. |pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Jan Jansma tells me 3@S is a strong relay whereas 3@H is a weak relay|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: he is prepared to give up his third trump trick to cut down on ruffs|pg||
nt|bogier: ciekawa i odwa¿na licytacja na drugim stole|pg||
nt|hedyg: LOL|pg||
nt|athene: in theory, one is about a fifth of a percent better|pg||
nt|cicus: I have seen several misunderstandings using it|pg||
nt|athene: in practice, what happens is, people have misunderstandings over which they are playing about every second hand|pg||

pc|d4|nt|stc: strnage bidding and resutl from OR on this hand|pg||
nt|iain sime: Another big swing for Italy here as 25 points not enough for a Swiss 3NT in the other room.|pg||
nt|hedyg: it is the 2@H bid that is strange with 11 hcps|pg||
nt|barnets: @SQ @DAKQ @HK|pg||
nt|schtsch: but excuse my ignorance, i would lead @h on this one|pg||
nt|toral5: claim time:)|pg||
pc|d5|nt|bagman: North knew to lead low with known 4-carder on his right. Now he hit gold|pg||
nt|brolucius: You can see what I meant when I mentioned 'hard work' a short while ago. It would all be too much for me.|pg||
nt|hedyg: you just stick to your agreements|pg||
nt|gulyas: a disciplined pass|pg||
nt|cicus: there is never a problem with 4NT ace asking|pg||
nt|hedyg: wow Hungary moving ahead|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: That's like saying you don't want to play any gadget because it could go wrong|pg||

nt|andy_h: Bas, did South ask West of his preempting styles?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not Madala's set, 30 of the 31 IMPs were caused by wrong decisions |pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: *I would've long undid it|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Undone even|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Or we could say that 30 of the 31 IMPs to Norway came after good decisions by Brogeland|pg||
nt|brolucius: 'How did you do in your match against Italy?'  'Let me show you a deal where I got Duboin three down in 3NT'.|pg||
nt|andyv:  I was impressed|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: lol|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: "What a player"|pg||
nt|andyv:  that he is:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 3NT is not a lucky contract this session, 80% of the times it was played it went down at this table|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Zivkovic left for the bathroom|pg||
nt|hedyg: strange pass by Versace this hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: would you pass?|pg||
nt|iain sime: Despite the opening lead accidents in the other room, Italy are building a substantial lead.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Perhaps 2NT is a better response (to a double of 1@D) than 2@H was. On the previous board. Those queens and jacks may play OK in NT.|pg||
nt|hedyg: how can one not bid ever with the W hand?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Surprising, as you say.|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok Gabor, i will never discuss any blackwood or keycard with you :)|pg||
nt|gulyas: I think you should play a simpler game, cicus:) you get excited too often over simple conventions|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: This was pretty funny. Dumbovich playing @HAK and Sementa saying "@HQJ partner" in Italian. Then declarer claimed and E assumed 7@H :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|athene: next month's Bridge World may seen an article from Fred, entitled "why conventions , especially texas transfers, are ruining the modern game"|pg||

nt|schtsch: madala thinking how crazy tesla is|pg||

nt|drorp: yep exactly|pg||
nt|drorp: probably that's what happened|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Bas without naming-me right:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: If there are any kibitzers staggered by the 0-0 scoreline, that is because there is no coverage of the Open Room and therefore no automatic scoring. |pg||
nt|brolucius: Open room has recorded 2@H+2 on this board.|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: That's true for any contract on any board, bridge is a 100% no luck game|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Contract bridge that is|pg||
nt|mamos: well  we might have forgiven Colin for doubling this one opposite a vul first in hand opener from part|pg||
nt|mamos: but then he has played with David a lot|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the NT games on 8 & 9 were a bit unlucky. the two subsequent ones were just bad contracts, even if one would rate to reach them|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i would say it is a better double than the one he actually did perpetrate|pg||
nt|skorchev: 1@D=11-17 hcp, 4+@D, unbal|pg||
nt|skorchev: 2NT = very weak or FG @D fit (tnx Rado)|pg||
nt|andyv:  this one should not be successful|pg||
nt|april7: E might end up here in an unmakable 3NT contract, but with 1NT answer by W if its not forcing might pass,otherwise they will reach 3NT|pg||
nt|athene: 2@D showed 8+ hcp, forcing to game if opener has the strong hand|pg||
nt|athene: i am told 3@C showed 4@S-5@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: Only lead not give away anything|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: lol|pg||
nt|capercliff: easily enough from the West hand|pg||
nt|paulg:  2@d is either a weak two in hearts or 5+@H with 18+ points|pg||
nt|sharkey: Surprised W didnt bid his @S suit OR|pg||
nt|brolucius: On a similar hand yesterday, David Greenwood was saying that he prefers a 1NT rebid on that East type. It seems to be a close decision between 1NT and 2@D, but I rather like 1NT.|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@H Precision 11-15|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this time they have stretched the odds|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: N explained it as just weak with @D|pg||

nt|toral5: so few more 4 iceland|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|bagman: Declarer is going to guess the trumps|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: That might be true, I'm being told no, nor the 2@C opening which would be 18-19 BAL|pg||
nt|bagman: because he can pick Qxxx from W but not from E unless he takes a direct finesse|pg||
nt|bagman: With the diamond lead it is possible that declarer plays spades from the top and relies on @C or @H|pg||
nt|iain sime: No, I would have bid 3@S. But two doubletons and an AK to lead and that is enough.|pg||
nt|andyv:  he certainly has that|pg||
pc|s4|nt|jtr: The live score service seems still down  Teething problems i guess|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 5-0 would be evil. 4-1 is just poor|pg||
nt|mbruun: OK|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Giorgio Mauri|pg||

nt|corplaw: def needs to cash first 4 tricks to assure set|pg||
pc|c2|nt|hedyg: 2@c= gazzilli like|pg||
nt|jbgood: i think that is the only explanation - 2 @c shows 3 card Major support and 8 +(and never clubs)|pg||
nt|jbgood: if clubs, 2 NT is a transfer to that suit|pg||
nt|andy_h: One benefit of playing this is that you don't need another route to show a 3 card limit raise, but the downside of it is that it can hurt the tempo of your 2/1 auctions if it ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: happens to be a GF|pg||
nt|hedyg: now 5@c by S?|pg||

nt|hedyg: useless K@S...|pg||
nt|skorchev: yes, since he is passed hand, the GF option is hardly possible|pg||

nt|petergill: 3 cards in @S I mean|pg||

nt|bagman: Now @SA, @C AK JT (@H discard), !JD and then heart finesse when in dummyt|pg||
nt|paulg:  GIB can take the heart finesse when the @dJ is ducked, as it can still play the diamonds for four tricks|pg||
nt|paulg:  More realistically, declarer will not be happy (yet)|pg||
nt|koksoy: but  in  practice  he  will play  clubs first  then diamond jack..  then try  for  dropping @D9  .. if  not try  for  heart finesse  for  the  9th  trick|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer probably plays AK of clubs|pg||
nt|paulg:  doubleton @cQ is about the only option to make it|pg||

nt|hedyg: 3@c= good hand @S+@C|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I believe England lost a swing to Ireland last night when trumps broke 5-0 in a 6@C contract   |pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: np Peter :)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|othered1: Tis is pushy, but good @H spots and other good views may pull this through|pg||
nt|hedyg: only 2@H tricks|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@ds, 4@cs on a good guess|pg||
nt|hedyg: that is only 8|pg||
nt|bagman: In isolation the spade play should be @SK and then finesse(s)|pg||
nt|mbruun: Yes I remember not a sound overcall with a boring 5332 and a bad suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Silence was golden for Muller in the other room|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He passed in a flash|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In order not to risk further penalties|pg||
nt|rv: win @HA and cash @SA now|pg||
pc|c5|nt|marlowepi: as S has no 4th D, E is in control|pg||
nt|hedyg: if i would bid 2NT opps would take the 1st 5 @ss|pg||
nt|gulyas: I like the way this match goes - some pushes, some doubledigit swings to Hungary, some more pushes:)|pg||
nt|athene: well i suppose the same contract will be reached in the other room|pg||
nt|athene: with 15 hcp facing 10, all suits covered, and no great fit anywhere|pg||
pc|h5|nt|snetram:  remis|pg||
nt|hedyg: no entry to dummy|pg||
nt|stc: yes but if they play twice @c and @h S is endplay after the @d ruff|pg||

nt|andyv:  3|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|hedyg: OR same 3NT|pg||
nt|bagman: There are some chances for a 2nd trump trick for S|pg||
nt|frululu: and wd|pg||
pc|h8|nt|Walddk2: NL and Russia lost 3VPs each yesterday for slow play|pg||
nt|bagman: With the setting trick in his hand S might have considered cashing it but there's really no way that the @HA can run away|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Vanuzzi has taken a bathroom break|pg||
nt|babs59: Italy gained again when North treated her red 5/5 as a multi 2|pg||
nt|babs59: so they played in 3@D rather than 3NT|pg||
nt|babs59: sensible treatment when you have multis - the singleton @SQ downgrades|pg||
nt|rv: well played|pg||
pc|c7|nt|mamos: what if South had won Ace and played Diamond?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: lol Daniel|pg||
nt|athene: i guess 2NT is showing a good diamond suit  because 1@D can't have more than 17 points|pg||
nt|hedyg: try to sound impartial Daniel :)|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Top 6 + the Netherlands qualify for the Bermuda Bowl next year. If NL are among the 6, seventh also qualifies|pg||
nt|april7: why not pass a passable bid|pg||
nt|athene: Lauria could definitely have passed 3@DX i think|pg||
nt|athene: he has pretty decent diamond support for a man who has shown 9 cards in the majors|pg||
nt|atabey: 3@d X was a good spot. what made lauria run from it?|pg||
nt|atabey: ok. I am told that 3@d was a relay. not natural|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|hedyg: same lead|pg||
nt|atabey: confirmed by the audiance. turkey 46 czech republic 1. for now. ladies match|pg||
nt|brolucius: Important to pick up every available trick in defence when opponents have 650 in the bag already.|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I am sorry, I lost play here, I'll claim the correct amount of tricks|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok|pg||
nt|hedyg: did Zorlu play another @d?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Yes and declarer played the @Cs right|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok ty|pg||
nt|atabey: then its -1|pg||
nt|atabey: at least -1 I mean|pg||
nt|atabey: still a small swing for italy|pg||
nt|hedyg: Kandemir misguessed the @c and Madala switched to ..............10@s!|pg||
nt|othered1: Defense in other room was merciless after declarer misguessed @C|pg||
nt|andy_h: So, E-W seem to have handled the interference well as one generally needs to be prepared if you play any type of relay sequences|pg||
nt|xenya: it would be interesting to see 2@DXX -- but with S's diamond holding the chances of that are almost non-existent |pg||
nt|rodvenn: Brogeland played 3 times diamonds. Which must be the right defense|pg||
nt|wstuart: good def|pg||
pc|d2|nt|bogier: wszystko przez ocene K karo, który wydaje sie kiepski- a jest swietny|pg||

nt|ziff:  I have done comments on Australian events, I know how you feel :)|pg||
nt|athene: ok 3@D asking for shape?|pg||
nt|athene: so 3nt just showed 4-5-2-2 maybe|pg||
nt|atabey: this will go some down. its a matter of time only. can we assume how many down?|pg||
pc|d6|nt|capercliff: well done:)|pg||
nt|bagman: South tries for 2 down|pg||
pc|dA|nt|brolucius: N/S play reverse count signals, so Bocchi has shown two hearts.|pg||
nt|brgpro: he has to duck again to give himself a chance although declarer can play @s and make this anyways|pg||
nt|andyv:  3@d probably invite... who knows what 4@d would be|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@H showed 3 spades (not 4) and not 4@D|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|rodvenn: If North has the J9 of trumps, the contract is down|pg||
nt|iain sime: Cracked it!|pg||
nt|stc: oops, a new communication opened|pg||
nt|hedyg: oy!|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Walddk2: Was 5 originally, but an appeal gave both teams 2 VPs back|pg||
pc|c9|nt|brolucius: Against a high heart to request a diamond switch.|pg||
nt|hedyg: K@H was a mistake |pg||
nt|koksoy: diamond VDKA|pg||
nt|bagman: This is the only layout, otherwise defense wins|pg||
nt|bagman: if @D9 is doubleton, the defense can take the @DA|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mamos: had another chance|pg||
nt|rv: now OTs though Caterina took a slight risk for that|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|rodvenn: and if he has the Jack +x declarer may make a mistake|pg||
nt|andyv:  eventually he will lead trump|pg||
nt|koksoy:  then  try for droping  @D9  (not finesse )  because he  has heart finesse as  well|pg||

nt|marlowepi: small error by declarer, and this is a valuable technical point -- as E in this situation you do NOT want to lead the 7-spot on the second round. always lead from the top in these ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: situations, so that the person showing out of trumps doesnt know how many trump tricks the defence have coming. often makes no difference, but good to get in habit of playing right ...|pg||

nt|drorp: i think it's more than enough with his hand|pg||
nt|drorp: Versace has a decision to make|pg||
nt|drorp: 6@S isn't that good|pg||
nt|athene: hard to bid slam with nineteen plain-suit losers|pg||
nt|drorp: just works here|pg||
nt|athene: i guess versace is giving it a good look|pg||
nt|athene: this delay can't be Palma, can it?|pg||
nt|athene: his options over 5@S are: pass|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: you do a great job! my favorite operator :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Thanks :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: lol, that means a lot, given the amount of sessions I've seen you commentate, haha|pg||
nt|capercliff: that wasnt really a slow pass was it?|pg||
pc|cT|nt|Walddk2: Gazzilli I presume|pg||
nt|mbruun: Sp K is huge, but still 1 NT is stretchy|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: No, it wasn't|pg||
nt|capercliff: tx|pg||
nt|paulg:  of course the Scottish expectations for this match will be low so Piper does have free rein to try for a result|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I just figured that with all my typing I might as well enter the bidding real life when I'm typing :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: why did he pass?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Wasn't he the 15 year old wonder boy 10 years ago?|pg||
nt|bogier: ktr mog³aby doprowadziæ do sytuacji ¿e N podejmowa³by decyzjê na poziomie 4|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, for promotion, but he can do that no matter which trump trick he wins|pg||
nt|mamos: ah yes  he just didnt do it |pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: There is some kind of socialist festival going on outside with loud music, fire crackers and a small carnival|pg||
nt|brolucius: Some players use a new major at the two-level (facing a weak two-bid of some sort) to be invitational but non-forcing. In that way they can pick up the games where there is a fit ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: for responder's suit. A new suit at the three-level is forcing.|pg||
nt|petergill: Interesting (disciplined?) that Sementa chooses 3@D raise rather than direct 4@S|pg||
nt|petergill: I expected North to bid 5@C|pg||
nt|paulg:  Shields bids 2@s so that he can compete in hearts on the next round ... if there were one|pg||
pc|c4|nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|dougdscsu: really dont like pass with Piper's hand, hes got 9 hcp and support for partners suit..|pg||
nt|paulg:  i'm sure it was an 'action' pass|pg||
nt|andy_h: Looks like a swing for norway here|pg||
nt|brolucius: Neither East rates his hand as worth a 2@D bid to show a sound raise to 2@H. No, but it is around a maximum for the direct raise.|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@H is 7+|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I am being told Finnish and Hungarian have a shared ancestry, there you go kids, don't believe what you're being told :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  Italy chipping away at the lead with 2 imp gains on boards 7 and 8|pg||
nt|athene: normally when you push opps to the 5-level, you don't do anything after that|pg||
nt|athene: they might be one down; they might have missed a slam|pg||
nt|athene: you are in a really advantageous situation|pg||
pc|cK|nt|Walddk2: 2@C either natural or any 16+|pg||
nt|bogier: troche zamieszania- Cezary walczy z w³asn¹ intuicj¹, która podpowiada³a mu skrecic w BA|pg||
nt|bagman: If @SK were wrong and the clubs very badly, declarer got from the lead a heart trick for his 10th trick|pg||
nt|mamos: perfect playing conditions for bridge|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I am sorry, sometimes bid don't register properly...|pg||
nt|cicus: that theory is already refuted|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: That's only proving my last point :)|pg||
nt|athene: if this auction was forced on EW by system it's not a great advertisement for polish club 1@C opener in competition, i don't think|pg||
nt|schtsch: noone will understand it but it could get them to slam|pg||
nt|schtsch: 1@s positive|pg||
nt|schtsch: 1nt relay|pg||
nt|schtsch: he bid balanced hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Palma had a swift pass, it was Versace thinking|pg||
nt|athene: right|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@H natural but denies 8+hcp|pg||
nt|capercliff: he might double if they reach 5@d?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: he is only 23 I hear, born 1987|pg||
nt|bagman: There were entry problems to go for that line and set up 3 heart tricks|pg||
nt|hedyg: as usual the @c suit got lost|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer is playing close to DD|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Sorry all, the OR crashed so we had to reestablish the link|pg||
nt|wstuart: this is a tough one. 2 controlish hands with the right doubletons opposite length in the other hand|pg||
nt|rnmalik: comes the @D switch.|pg||
nt|toral5: couple of imps 4 holland|pg||
pc|cA|nt|andy_h: The 2@S opening did its job, with the 3@S adding more preemptive value|pg||
nt|lesniak: oczywiscie wist w trefla kladaie 3 ba ale kto to wymysli|pg||
nt|antoniz: please heart lead|pg||
nt|brolucius: And the @D suit.|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Don't NS play weak 2's?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Or did Madala judge it as too bad|pg||
nt|barnets: same contract|pg||
nt|petergill: North does not like to use the Pass Card unless he has to|pg||
nt|paulg:  as it happens, the double fit means that they have missed game|pg||
nt|koksoy: and  2@D  seems  natural...  because he  prefered to  bid 2@S  with  4-4  major|pg||
nt|bagman: Sementa's going to play a trump now|pg||
nt|schtsch: 3@d obviously his shape|pg||
nt|rv: I prefer 1n rebid with South hand with 5422 and min hand|pg||
nt|drorp: Lauria isn't sure he's making 5 yet|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Walddk2: 3@C natural, NF|pg||
nt|bagman: here there are 3 top tricks to lose and then declarer has to guess the trumps (which he will after this lead)|pg||
nt|antoniz: dobrze Rysiu:)|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: pañskie zyczenie jest rozkazem|pg||
nt|vasmar: E-W can make 3@D|pg||
nt|hedyg: not 2suiters, no|pg||
nt|petergill: Bas - when in doubt, assume that Ozols did not pass?|pg||
nt|athene: if east really has to jump all the way to 3nt just to show the strong hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  great dummy for N|pg||
nt|athene: versace assumed the 5@S bid was a club but not huge red-suit strength so there's strong likelihood of two red losers|pg||
pc|c2|nt|hedyg: 2@H is wow|pg||
nt|paulg:  might double 3N|pg||
nt|hedyg: specs suggest he cannot play the hand if he raises |pg||
nt|capercliff: or 3N for a @s lead?|pg||
nt|mamos: 3NT was good i was just going to say   but  .....|pg||
nt|brolucius: Six cards, 4-10 points, on their card.|pg||
nt|hedyg: but E could have bid 2@d here|pg||
nt|hedyg: i really dont see why he didnt|pg||
nt|snetram:  kierowy atak stwarza problem|pg||
nt|jkotor: nasi ³adnie tutaj wistowali w Otwartym, ale RZG ustawi³ wpust|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@h was polish in OR on board 8... showed 5@h and 5 of other....5-11 hcp... she was max for her bid|pg||
nt|schtsch: 3@h asking controls or something|pg||
nt|wstuart: Does anyone know exactly what Croatia needs in this match to advance?|pg||
nt|schtsch: don't know their system, just guessing|pg||
nt|schtsch: 27:3 :)|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So 16-18 with spades and clubs|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Is there a brake pedal to this auction?|pg||
nt|sybarra: nice of @S's to be 3/3|pg||
nt|mbruun: North will probably lead a diamond against a spade contract, and the 3-3 break combined with good intermediates allows it to make|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Sementa could have passed 3@C|pg||
nt|mdgraham: he could have passed 1@S too|pg||
nt|mbruun: With a nondiamond lead declarer lacks an entry|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Indeed|pg||
nt|capercliff: 4@h is a good contract|pg||
nt|dougdscsu: still hope for italy, 2-1 now|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Thanks|pg||
nt|capercliff: and maybe 6@d on any lead other than a @h|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Won't tell him until the contract is over, dw Scots :)|pg||
nt|xenya: and a huge one|pg||
nt|bagman: Then, on the other hand, declarer might have lost a spade and two clubs with the heart|pg||
nt|stc: -5 possible|pg||
nt|hedyg: now J@C|pg||
nt|hedyg: well, only 50/ trick|pg||
nt|toral5: infact 1 imp.cant go less thn 2 down i guess|pg||
pc|s6|nt|brolucius: Declarer must take steps to avoid two trump losers. Ace and low to the jack will work.|pg||
nt|brolucius: He can afford that safety play only when he knows that there are only two losers in the side suits.|pg||
nt|brolucius: With three side-suit losers he would have to play the A-K, hoping to drop a doubleton queen.|pg||
nt|atabey: very good pass by assael. could be a cold 4@h|pg||
nt|hedyg: did we miss out a double Bas?|pg||
nt|bagman: They are on their way. West seems to think that diamonds are solid (and they are :) )|pg||
nt|marlowepi: after the king of hearts drops the queen from N, there is a good case for swtiching tacks and knocking out the ace of clubs. you want to take the entry out of the hand that has the ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: long diamonds|pg||
nt|mamos: Pric wants more|pg||
nt|sybarra: but spades are 3/3 |pg||
nt|rv: I might have given false preference to 2@h with North hand if the auction proceeded as 1@h-1@S-2@d|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I'm not a traditionalist but would happily pass the S hand|pg||
nt|athene: *5@S bid was a club void|pg||
nt|atabey: versace has nothing extra to thk. even less then when he was bidding over 2@c|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sybarra: can he get the pitches |pg||
nt|athene: i suppose it's ok if it shows something really specific|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: When I went from Finland to Estonia a couple of years ago I found the languages very similar too|pg||
nt|snetram:  trzeba siÄ odblokowaÄ damÄ trefl|pg||
nt|jkotor: wist: NT- 4th from bad holdings|pg||
nt|ziff:  NP|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 5@Dx only 300, but this vulnerability is not great for sacrificing |pg||
nt|athene: well i doubt 3@C showed as much as he has|pg||
pc|sK|nt|atabey: for NS I mean|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I didn't see it, barring human error, no, no Xs|pg||
nt|atabey: probably yes|pg||
nt|hedyg: and it was for sure Sementa who bid 2@H? not Assael?|pg||
nt|atabey: what is 2@h by sementa otherwise|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: That I am sure of|pg||
nt|atabey: then 2@h was by assael for sure|pg||
nt|hedyg: double by Duboin seems pretty automatic after 2@d|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: That's correct, I might've missed it|pg||
nt|petergill: A boring game, 5@D would not be much of a save|pg||
nt|schtsch: denial now|pg||
nt|wstuart: I hear that Croatia needs 27:3 to have a fighter but it is still not sure then, depending on other matches|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|brolucius: Lauria passed 2NT after the same start in the Open Room. |pg||
nt|hedyg: maybe|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: In any case, S declares 3@D :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|atabey: so duboin dbled. is that correct?|pg||
nt|andyv:  always tough to play them when you are in 6|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It would be a travesty if Duboin bid 4@S, North led a diamond, and 4@S got wrapped up|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is not down yet|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, I know it can be defeated but you don't always get the best defence|pg||
nt|mdgraham: might be difficult for NS to switch to hearts, after the 2@H bid by East |pg||
nt|bjacobs: The defence will need to grab their heart tricks when in with a spade (or earlier)|pg||
nt|toral5: duck|pg||
pc|dK|nt|hedyg: we dont know Yalcin|pg||
nt|hedyg: lets assume he did|pg||
nt|andyv:  as a spec points out, 6@s is also there|pg||
nt|sybarra: yikes|pg||
nt|marlowepi: wd|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: lol|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Well, you opened 1@H partially because of your distribution, right? Why then not bid that second suit?|pg||
nt|rv: Gabrielle used her women's instinct and made the wnning bid of 2@s|pg||
pc|d3|nt|bagman: Oopes|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Enough of linguistics :)|pg||
nt|jkotor: czyli 4 najlepsza ze s³abych kolorów|pg||

nt|drorp: his hand mainly had 2 extra spades than he already promised, but that's quite significant|pg||
pc|d2|nt|bagman: Declarer should play for the drop in diamonds but people do finesse sometimes|pg||
nt|andyv:  dbl here could be devastating to declarer|pg||

mb|p|nt|atabey: its a difficult job. not what it looks like|pg||
mb|2D|nt|brolucius: Fair enough to play @SA-K here because declarer had no reason to expect only one club loser. |pg||

nt|petergill: Yes, surely they will reach 4@S and surely it will make. Even 3NT makes|pg||
nt|gulyas: it makes:)|pg||
nt|athene: 6@D or 6@S are possible|pg||
nt|wstuart: Here is a report from a kib:     9 team advancing. Crotias max possible is 289 VP, Wales - leading 16-14 against Slovakia - is currently No 9 with 290.|pg||
nt|athene: if E-W bid a lot of diamonds, north might just bash 6@H in|pg||
nt|drorp: big hand for N opposite the 1@H opening, but indeed, anything above 4@H will fail|pg||
nt|athene: versace likes his double fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: indeed|pg||
nt|andyv:  NS more ambition in OR.. reached 3N down 1|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3H has a lot going for it|pg||

mb|3N|nt|pasker: only 3 obvious losers but a lot of work to do especially with trumps 4-0|pg||
nt|andyv:  if you are the underdog, the N hand is one that you might want to play around with and open... maybe 3@d, or 1@d or even 1@h|pg||
nt|bagman: South might X the spade game|pg||
nt|bagman: he might not beat it|pg||
nt|andyv:  not with N passing|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Clear preference he has|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 2NT asking, 3@H possibly medium hand with @C shortness :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't pass with N hand|pg||
nt|koksoy: with 23 4-4  fit  and  a  singleton  its good to  play  4  , but most of the  pairs have not methods after 1nt openning|pg||
nt|petergill: Very conservative by NS - who went wrong?|pg||
nt|athene: i suppose fear of two spade losers might slow north down|pg||

nt|mbruun: Third quarter for Italy |pg||
nt|brolucius: Excellent work by Mossop! Many would go on bidding on that collection.|pg||
nt|petergill: In the World Rankings, the highest ranked Italian player in this team is Giorgio Duboin, ranked the 2nd best player in the world. The highest ranked Latvian in this team is ranked ...|pg||
nt|petergill: 684th in the world.  (My figures may be a few months out of date)|pg||
nt|athene: that was quite some 3@H bid, vul against not|pg||
nt|hedyg: 6@D is off on a @S lead|pg||
nt|snetram:  kierowy to poprawny atak|pg||
nt|athene: if 4@D is just a splinter, 4@S is a very big bid|pg||
nt|athene: basically if you make a cue which raises the level of the final contract, that should be a good hand|pg||
nt|drorp: now that he knows his A@D is worth nothing, he'd wish he could bid 4@H|pg||
pc|h2|nt|brolucius: I once made 3NT on just 24 points but I can't remember the hand now.|pg||

nt|Walddk2: I don't agree with the jack. That will give her a losing option|pg||
pc|hT|nt|Vugraphznk: The look on Versace's face in indescribable|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3Nt means interesting hand (@S are fixed)|pg||
nt|bagman: If EW bid in confidence, S should not X. If it's invitational, X would be fine|pg||
nt|hedyg: quite so!|pg||
nt|athene: after 4@S it's going to be hard to stop north|pg||
nt|atabey: barbosa is very happy now. showed clubs then short @d then void @d|pg||
nt|athene: if i were north i would bid a slam after hearing 4@S|pg||
nt|athene: i certainly wouldn't have bid 4@S as south|pg||
nt|drorp: that's why i prefer not to splinter with voids, singleton and void are totally different you can't have the same bid to show either of them|pg||
nt|atabey: he told everything he had. I'd pass in a sec|pg||
nt|athene: i agree it's very important to differentiate as quickly and clearly as possible between voids and singletons|pg||
nt|drorp: opposite singletong, south thought his hand is working well, only J@D wasted, and has a club fit, not that i agree with 4@S, but i can see why he thought about it|pg||
nt|athene: they just aren't the same :) not even close|pg||
nt|april7: the 4 @S bid might be the ace ,then N has a difficult decision|pg||
nt|drorp: also, his pass on the double already showed a minimal balanced hand... otherwise he could bid 2@H\3@C|pg||
nt|athene: 5@D exclusion might have worked - south bids 5@H saying no keycards outside diamonds, end of story|pg||
nt|drorp: XX\whatever|pg||
nt|drorp: 5@H is too high already|pg||
nt|drorp: i think N should pass|pg||
nt|drorp: why did u bid 5@D if you're not passing 5@H?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Barbosa bid 6@H and Lauria has called the TD|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|brolucius: North considering a pass. Yes, he has passed.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bill, remember to tune in for the cricket in 30 mins|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 9-0 at the moment|pg||
nt|bjacobs: too tired, too uninterested|pg||
nt|bjacobs: There's something a bit wrong with this auction ...|pg||
nt|bridge_one: after passed hand right to give the chance to play slam|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Madala apologising now|pg||
nt|petergill: Should North do more? South?|pg||
nt|athene: if he heard 5@S he would bid 5NT grand slam force|pg||
nt|athene: maybe 5@H very slow and lauria thinks north has to pass it|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I daren't say|pg||
pc|h5|nt|andyv:  EW are one pair that always bids in confidence:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I suspect neither would South|pg||
pc|h7|nt|Walddk2: Yes I am|pg||
nt|brolucius: I look forward to it.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Just waiting for David to send me an invitation for lunch|pg||
nt|jtr: Dont hold your breath|pg||
nt|othered1: Note that Duboin stayed out of the auction, despite vulnerability.  West's action in OR bought -800, abetted by east.|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: *is|pg||
pc|h9|nt|Walddk2: and Marc Smith. That could be fun|pg||
nt|brolucius: Consider yourself invited (after the world cup is over).|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer is going to take his finesses in the majors and ends up with 10 or 11 tricks|pg||
nt|bagman: A spade to the 9 now?|pg||
nt|bagman: and then heart?|pg||
nt|paulg:  hard to believe that the cards could lie so well|pg||
nt|drorp: yeah 5@H was quite slow, but normal tempo in slam bidding|pg||
nt|atabey: lots of specs saying 4@s is a way overbid. I agree. even @d shortness is good you have to have some points also :)|pg||
nt|athene: this might be only a small loss, though|pg||
nt|athene: might be 5@H-1 in the other room|pg||
nt|april7: I think the 4 @S bid was to much for N to bear|pg||
nt|athene: yes, you are forcing to a slam with north after 4@S|pg||
nt|athene: well i am :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: It won't matter much in the end, since 6@H will go down|pg||
nt|athene: maybe i had better not play with Palma|pg||
nt|atabey: so I have to take it back what I said about N|pg||
nt|athene: but i would not have responded 2@C; i would have shown heart support first round|pg||
nt|april7: if you can show a void and support in @H, but a splinter(singleton) is not enough|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Versace asking Palma about other bids Barbosa could've made|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5@H made in the other room after a spade to the ace|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That set up the queen for a club pitch|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 3@S is not in any way invitational is it?  So is North allowed to bid 4@S?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Something is an underbid|pg||
nt|antoniz: dobrze idzie|pg||
nt|pasker: that lead should help|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|iain sime: Should be 1100  |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Everyone knows hos the cards lie in a second|pg||
nt|Walddk2: (no club)|pg||
nt|hedyg: he might regret that J@S|pg||
nt|athene: yes i didn't mean makeable necessarily i mean they might get bid|pg||
nt|cicus: I wonder why W overtook, he could have gone to hand with a @D|pg||
nt|athene: i am told france brought home 6@S|pg||
nt|schtsch: with only 2VPs available for croatia here|pg||
nt|april7: big swing then for Italy|pg||
pc|c2|nt|vasmar: there was a safe heart lead for N |pg||
pc|c4|nt|Walddk2: Thank you|pg||
nt|petergill:  1 is Fulvio Fantoni, pushed up by his World Pairs win in 2002|pg||
pc|cA|nt|hedyg: if 2NT could be this weak E had no business bidding 5@d|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@d by N in OR was unusual vs unusual|pg||
nt|othered1: Maybe they don't have a narrow range for the action at this vul and east was taking a general direction shot.  But double of 3@D might bring partner back in on the right hand.|pg||
nt|hedyg: France is killing Lithuania, so far 51:1 after 13 bds|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the lead help|pg||
nt|bagman: Now this is more or less over. declarer has many ways for 10 tricks and some for 11|pg||
nt|brolucius: Madala is looking around for an Undo button. 'Sorry, I don't know what happened. Obviously I meant to pass over 5@D.'|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|stc: E has better majors|pg||
nt|stc: As I heard on BBO:"my daughter bounced my arm"|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: lol|pg||
nt|hedyg: cannot use that excuse in Ostend|pg||
nt|brolucius: Mind you, who can say that 5@H was wrong? He could have ended up being a hero if the North and East hands were adjusted a bit.|pg||
nt|hedyg: 56:1 sry|pg||
nt|cicus: now has to settle for 11 tricks as a @H ruff would make N's @S87 a trick|pg||
nt|jkotor: szansa na -2|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer's best chance to make the contract is the same as playing for max|pg||
pc|h8|nt|paulg:  this is an important match for Wales as they are currently lying 9th in the standings and the last qualifying spot, just 8VPs clear of tenth|pg||
nt|marlowepi: these two countries both claim nationality credit for Marco Polo|pg||
nt|rnmalik: wd|pg||

nt|xenya: good @D switch -- Italy is likely to pick 2 imps here|pg||
nt|andy_h: Not much to this hand. Declarer's thinking suggests that he is trying to protect against any foul breaks which is what you want to do in case it happens|pg||
nt|bagman: The @CA is marked south|pg||
nt|bagman: So is the @SK with some confidence|pg||
pc|hA|nt|bjacobs: Suspect the problem is the 2@S bid|pg||

nt|jtr: Looks like this is going to drift a few off at least|pg||

nt|Walddk2: If they are married, as Mike suggested in the beginning, he will hear about it all evening and night|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And Sementa finds a truly evil defensive play, putting South under all sorts of pressure|pg||
nt|sybarra: I suspect they have sorted this out much earlier than now |pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I think they are btw, same rings though she has it on her right hand and he on his left|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer has quite a good count of the hand and can go for the line to make 11 tricks|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Anyone for some ping pong?|pg||
nt|hedyg: good defense by E|pg||
nt|Walddk2: N and W might just as well fold their cards|pg||

nt|mbruun: Grand on a heart finesse|pg||
nt|mbruun: 6 Sp will be reached|pg||
nt|brolucius: He likes to use an auction of 1@D - 2@C - 2NT (on 11) - 3NT (in case partner has 14), to get to such games.|pg||

nt|sybarra: last bd of this set?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, the main advantage is when the club is strong, but in many systems where it isnt necessarily strong the strong hand is one of the possible types, so for consistency maybe they ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: play it always|pg||
nt|mamos: i think so|pg||
nt|sybarra: thx to our brilliant operator (with sticky key board) Bas |pg||
nt|iain sime: Switzerland pick up 21 imps in two hands. |pg||
nt|hedyg: 1NT fair enough, no good rebid if 1@c opening|pg||
nt|brolucius: Anyway, whatever we think the odds for or against Madala's 5@H, let us not forget the fine judgement of West on the deal.|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes indeed!|pg||
nt|stc: or just go on the officail site, click result and runing scores|pg||
nt|hedyg: he got the hand out of his system by bidding 4NT|pg||
nt|hedyg: Bas? a problem?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Even for Swiss supporters.|pg||
nt|barnets: Italy bid a very good slam here with only 27hcp and key singleton |pg||

nt|barnets: in diamonds|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: Thanks for the vote of confidence lol|pg||
nt|hedyg: we have no choice Bas!|pg||
nt|athene: two trumps, @CA, @DK to lose here, i would think, unless something very serious goes wrong in the defence|pg||
nt|snetram:  kolejny dobry zapis czÄÅciowy pary B-N|pg||
nt|babs59: I'd have thought, with 3 top losers, that the @H finesse was her only option - so yes|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: CTD just announced half time|pg||
nt|andyv:  same here|pg||
nt|babs59: half time - for most other matches :)|pg||
nt|petergill: Patana has reopened with Dbl of 2@H at the other table|pg||
nt|wstuart: Comeback!  lol|pg||
nt|corplaw: another good result for croatia in the open room|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|brolucius: The message we should all take away with us is that it is possible to play good bridge at high speed. (Easier to play bad bridge slowly, I agree.) |pg||
nt|hedyg: 5@d good sac|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 6@C by NS on?|pg||
nt|bogier: zapisz sobie w kajecie|pg||
nt|sybarra: and thx to Mike and Marshall for joining us |pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Not so brilliant today I'm afraid, thanks though :)|pg||

nt|koksoy: :)|pg||
nt|corplaw: NS can make 4H|pg||
nt|frululu: check the bidding in open room :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 4@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  already different|pg||
nt|barnets: the only wasted N/s point is the@SJ|pg||
nt|barnets: and the @DJ|pg||
nt|petergill: 1NT 12-15 .... |pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Trivia: just now there were almost 5200 people watching 10 tables from Ostend, that's quite a lot imo :)|pg||
mb|1S!|nt|brgpro: 20 bds matches and round robin...this is too tough for me...|pg||
nt|brolucius: I actually missed a wine tasting to see the hopeless performance against Algeria. (No greater sacrifice has man...)|pg||
nt|brgpro: that's why i stay in the PABF zone:)|pg||
nt|jtr: lol|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: Orange (Dutch team's nickname) played badly as well, but at least we got out with 1-0 and 2-0 victories :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: notice the 1 @d bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: not 2, not 3|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1level Italian overcalls can be very weak|pg||
nt|othered1: they feel strongly about getting in at the 1-level.  Failure to do so is meaningful.|pg||
nt|hedyg: right|pg||
nt|atabey: this is not one of them thou. 6-4 with a decent suit. standard I thk|pg||
nt|hedyg: standrard 3@d?|pg||
nt|othered1: agree, but west may allow for even less.|pg||
nt|hedyg: 13-16|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: (Obviously I didn't disturb Versace during play btw)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: OR seems to be playing in 3@C|pg||
nt|brolucius: A conservative assessment.|pg||
nt|bagman: Playing 5@C, what would you do on a diamond lead?|pg||
nt|pasker: N may open 3@D here and is likely to play there|pg||
nt|bagman: Might W X?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: may South pass ? :)|pg||
nt|athene: north had better not do something silly like lead away from a king on opening lead|pg||
nt|paulg:  They are a very small bridge nation and it would be a first|pg||
nt|koksoy: why  do  you  think  so?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: The boards certainly haven't been boring!|pg||
nt|babs59: except Norway Germany is only board 8!|pg||
nt|petergill: North has redoubled, so full credit to Alfredo Versace for not reopening|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you might try 2NTas South, but it's only 9 hcp, and the singleton heart isn't exactly a bonus|pg||
nt|ahri: Sementa was out of blue cards.|pg||
nt|schtsch: great result for croatia in open|pg||
nt|ahri: I think standard bidding box provides three of those.|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: I am a Dry Stone Waller, all day long I Dry Stone Wall. Of all appalling callings, Dry Stone Walling's worst of all (Pam Ayres)|pg||
nt|hedyg: good!|pg||
nt|hedyg: if you say so......|pg||
nt|petergill: downgrading the 4333 makes bidding the slam very tough = unlucky |pg||
nt|athene: although he might even survive that perhaps|pg||
mb|1N|nt|hedyg: looks like a preempt hand to me|pg||
nt|bagman: up goes the ace and down goes the contract|pg||
nt|bagman: Either S or W might be thinking right now; S should not, though|pg||
nt|cicus: 2@C is Drury, even by an unpassed hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@c is drury|pg||

nt|paulg:  However this particular team has done well in the UK this year, so they are very much in form|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: In the Open B group only three matches have progressed up to 10 boards|pg||
nt|andyv:  last one E needed to slow down just a hair.|pg||
nt|schtsch: ew off the hook|pg||
nt|wstuart: there is no hook, really if they get to the right strin, is there?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 76 IMPs over 20 boards is a 25-1 victory|pg||

nt|athene: unlikely they will reach game here but not impossible|pg||
nt|jkotor: co to za X?|pg||
nt|babs59: is the DBL a negative bid perhaps?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Seeing as it was alerted I'm not sure whether it's actually a penalty X|pg||
nt|babs59: often it's the negative after overcalls|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 6@C is a maker here because @SK is onside and @ST9 stiff, I think|pg||
nt|corplaw: EW can make 2C; don't know why sementa ran from that|pg||
nt|wstuart: had EW been able to get to @Cs they would be in decent shape at either making or -1|pg||
nt|schtsch: true|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Yes, but not polite to boast about it. Think about the French and English supporters...|pg||
nt|bagman: N is not going to sit, I guess|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 6NT with a not unlikely @H lead is on, haha|pg||
nt|brolucius: Does North dare to defend? I don't expect so.|pg||
nt|sybarra: and thx also to the specs for your helpful and humorous comments|pg||
nt|barnets: well i am not sure unlucky north has a great hand|pg||
nt|barnets: with two AKs|pg||
nt|Gerben42: not just a great hand but a working great hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: For those who didn't know :)|pg||

nt|mdgraham: Spain bid one of these grands against (I think) Ireland yesterday - it made|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: And thanks to Shirley for sharing her insights with us once more :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  asking for @h lead?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: just a value bid|pg||
nt|skorchev: asking for imps? :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  W has easy @s lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  and can probably switch to @d without much ado|pg||
nt|skorchev: usually pass followed by DBL shows 9-11 hcp, balanced hand without fit|pg||
nt|fabsayc: diamond switch is 7 for declarer|pg||
nt|koksoy: who  afraids vulneribility  and  lack  of  points ??  not  Duboin|pg||
nt|paulg:  North's 4@s is reasonable, but not what South wanted to hear|pg||
nt|bagman: Pass or raise? South has shown a good diamond one-suiter|pg||
nt|koksoy: pass  is  ok..|pg||
nt|bagman: Any move and NS go minus|pg||
nt|paulg:  at this vulnerability the ace of hearts may be opposite void|pg||
nt|koksoy: sometimes S has 11  winners  but  its good  to  play  9 or  10  for  him|pg||
nt|koksoy: 8 or 9|pg||
nt|paulg:  club finesse may need partner to hold @c10|pg||

nt|atabey: with weak they dont play transfers|pg||
nt|othered1: This is a coffee hand, but better brew it quickly.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Thanks for watching!|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|vugraphznk: I liked the one against us as well, Roland ;)|pg||
nt|brolucius: West's 3@C will be some sort of heart raise - perhaps a mini-splinter. |pg||
nt|brgpro: let's not talk about football...the chinese team didnt even qualify from Asia...|pg||
nt|hedyg: just claim 11 and next|pg||
nt|hedyg: no time for coffee|pg||
nt|atabey: so he did :)|pg||
nt|dougdscsu: what an exciting week in both bridge and sports worlds|pg||
nt|bagman: W is going to try a surprise spade lead|pg||
nt|bagman: Here the size matters, is he going to lead the A?|pg||
nt|brolucius: South surely has nothing to think about, it must be West thinking.|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Never mind me, I counted 9 @Cs|pg||
nt|athene: ok - it's a bit more serious than that - it takes club lead and immediate diamond shift to beat, i think|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: EW explaining in detail whispering what their auction meant and NS said together "Drury"|pg||
nt|andyv:  N blinked|pg||
nt|fabsayc: actually 1nt looks cold|pg||

nt|lesniak: przecie bal musi zainwitowac 4 pik:)|pg||
nt|paulg:  i think pass will become more and more reasonable the longer he thinks about it|pg||
nt|bagman: Good decision; sometimes partner has the wonder cards but most often not|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 7-card major+raise=game|pg||
nt|ziff:  In the race for the qualifying positions the first 7 teams in this group should be fairly safe by now, with Wales, Norway, Hungary, Latvia and Croatia fighting it out for the last two spots.|pg||
nt|athene: south can do something to ask for a heart|pg||
nt|athene: ok|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|bagman: NS found a good sac here :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  a little rich with the vul but the distribution hard to argue against|pg||

mb|p|nt|jtr: Either West hasnt go a 3@c bid or East a 4@h bid|pg||
nt|brolucius: Better to not qualify than to reach South Africa and play like idiots.|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: I'd feel more comfortable bidding 1@S and raising @H after that, wouldn't that describe my hand better?|pg||
nt|brgpro: well, versace did the same but Lauria just gave it a try then signed off when pd said so|pg||
nt|brolucius: I will not be adding this bidding method to my card.|pg||
nt|jtr: 3@h weak looks ok to me as a passed hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Icemen are fearless. As soon as there is a game in sight .....|pg||
nt|brgpro: anyone is interested to talk about table tennis?:)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: to be fair, on a different lead it would have been a 5 or 7 hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: rofl|pg||
nt|paulg:  Also partner could have bid 6@d himself .. you have shown values with 4@s|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 15: The reopening Dbl has led Italy to 4@h at the other table|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Wales, eh? :)|pg||
nt|wstuart: this may well be a huge swing|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|athene: i don't see much chance of declarer getting his hearts away on spades|pg||
nt|bagman: Reminds of the meckwell deal against pakistan some (30) years ago|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, we all remember that...|pg||
nt|brolucius: Again it must be West thinking at this point. The bids are made in pairs, each side of the screen.|pg||
nt|bogier: system kanape?|pg||
nt|athene: i imagine the way to make this is get the clubs going fast for diamond discards|pg||
nt|athene: but i think declarer might have to be looking at all four hands to find the winning line|pg||
nt|koksoy: look  at  the  methods ..  how  you  can  find a  game  after 15-17  nt  opening  as  Ýtalians  did|pg||
nt|ziff:  ;)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mbruun: If partner has the fifth diamond 7 is cold. Difficult to investigate|pg||
nt|sybarra: how to know?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: When I played bridge with my mother Sunday she just hoped and dumped me in 7NT=|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Finesse onside|pg||

nt|jkotor: w przeciwieñstwie do 1@s - p - 2@s - 3@d - X|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer can play safe here: discard a spade on the @HA and give away the @CK|pg||
nt|toral5: these flat brds r NO GUD 4 dutch|pg||
mb|4H|nt|athene: so should lose two spades and a heart from here, for a boring 110|pg||

mb|p|nt|jtr: It shouldnt be all that weak when the opposition dont seem to be coming into the auction|pg||
nt|athene: ok now a trump works because north can't attack diamonds|pg||
nt|corplaw: another 8 - 9  imps to croatia|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: yes   sigh|pg||
nt|snetram:  albo canape, albo kanapa po polsku|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: heart shift looks very findable when your @CQ holds at trick 1|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  so, 12 more imps for Italy|pg||
nt|andyv:  and OR has finished|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer is in the nice position that it doesn't matter how many tricks he makes as long as he makes at least 6|pg||
nt|bagman: And he has 4 diamonds and @CA + @HA|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: And @SJ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Asking for shape  3@D  3343 or 3334  3@H asking  3NT  3334   If Bocchi had four diamonds, Madala might have been interested in slam|pg||

nt|brgpro: in talking|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, China women lost to Singapore|pg||
nt|jtr: Roland will Jack|pg||
nt|brolucius: Not a very good game to hope to slip through when facing Italy.|pg||
nt|jtr: There!|pg||
nt|mdgraham: If 3NT was a "serious" slam try, 4@S looks an underbid, but perhaps there is more to this than that |pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: EW discussing in Italian, sounds like an opera lol|pg||
nt|bagman: West had a very marginal T/O X by passed hand. With the @DQ changed to @HQ, he would have doubled, I think|pg||
nt|athene: south had to jump up with the @CA there to play the diamond through|pg||

nt|toral5: if pd has @S ace,this cont is unbeatable|pg||
pc|cA|nt|barnets: why should he downgrade such a nice hand|pg||
nt|babs59: the trump break stops declarer - she can no longer lead @HA and @H, then cross to the third @C in dummy|pg||
nt|babs59: because South can give her partner a ruff - so it hinges on the @S again|pg||
nt|babs59: no matter how long she thinks, this contract comes back to one line only|pg||

nt|wstuart: An interesting question was posed by a spec given the surprisingly poor play by Italy.  Could Italy be intentionally dumping IMPs to Croatia?|pg||
nt|schtsch: not very good though|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: This removes the entry to @DK|pg||
nt|bagman: Unless declarer wins it with the @SA|pg||
nt|bagman: This opens up a legitimate chance to make this; declarer goes up, picks the trumps with AK and leads a diamond up|pg||
nt|andyv:  Bocchi has certainly made Madala work today:)|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer knows that W has at most KJ on the top of her clubs and, thus, most of the other high cards|pg||
nt|andyv:  still should lose a @s, @d and 2@c|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: spade and diamond both right  - AND he avoided the club lead ..but 3-1 trumps will still prove insurmountable, surely|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It is: "pass is for penalties if the passer is sitting OVER the suit bid - it is neutral if sitting UNDER the suit bid"|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@d asking for distribution|pg||

nt|bagman: The spades are nicely but the clubs need to be worked on|pg||
nt|bagman: More chances to go wrong in 2 spades. In 3@C the line of play is sortof forced|pg||

nt|corplaw: it will be ranked ahead regardless of number of VPs obtained.|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Italy would not want their "5" match to count for Carryover and some 20+ matches to be excluded, I doubt they're intentionally dumping|pg||
nt|wstuart: however, there has been a fair amount of thought given to tournament formats which reduce the incentive/ability for "Sportsmanlike Dumping".|pg||
nt|marlowepi: croatia has offered to share the Glagolitic script with Italy in exchange for 30 IMPs|pg||

nt|rv: good nite Gary|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: cheers|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|vugraphznk: Roland has eyes everywhere...|pg||
nt|athene: hard for west to duck the club perhaps but it would have made things harder for declarer |pg||
nt|daman: a@H play now might be fatal|pg||
nt|athene: declarer now has some transportation to untangle his black tricks|pg||
nt|athene: four clubs, two spades, and the red aces is still only eight though|pg||
nt|athene: double dummy he can make quite easily by dropping the @HJ of course|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@s showed 2 keycards and cuebid in @s|pg||
nt|paulg:  nice contract but potential gain of 2 imps if Scotland bid the inferior 6@s|pg||
nt|hedyg: a lauria speciality|pg||
nt|bagman: Now @CA and trouble|pg||
nt|bogier: a u nas juz trenuje ekipa operatorów na przysz³oroczne ME w Poznaniu :)|pg||
nt|antoniz: ju¿ zaczêli trykaæ,tak trzymaæ|pg||
nt|athene: he can put north in with a heart to play a spade back|pg||
nt|athene: but then lauria will probably hold up in spades, test clubs, and as a last resort just play north to have the heart and nothing else, which works|pg||
nt|drorp: ducking again is not a bad idea|pg||
nt|athene: so i think nine tricks will come from two spades, three diamonds, three clubs and one heart|pg||
nt|drorp: then taking the 3rd, crossing to partner with @H and spade through, will make it very difficult for declearer|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|athene: but i don't see why he should find that|pg||
nt|bogier: znowu przed [parti¹|pg||
nt|stc: Madala is learning fast, this time he passed :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Madala has had enough of making risky heart bids.|pg||
nt|hedyg: pay-back time |pg||
nt|bogier: spryciarz|pg||
nt|paulg:  Madala and Bocchi bidding every possible game at the moment and finding a perfect lie of the cards|pg||
nt|bagman: Now the rest is about overtricks|pg||
nt|babs59: so at trick 2 she took another 10 minutes!|pg||
nt|toral5: how ll u play aftr a @H lead?duck and thn finesse @C 10?|pg||
pc|h6|nt|brolucius: Yes, he has always been interested in coffee.|pg||
nt|jtr: But usually focussed on Lavazza girls|pg||
pc|h5|nt|bagman: I think that Madala made up his mind about the hearts|pg||
nt|rodvenn: it surely must  be reight to save a tick. Well done charlsen|pg||
nt|rodvenn: trick|pg||
nt|gulyas: maybe he should play on @Ds|pg||
nt|cicus: hmm, this was not urgent|pg||
nt|gulyas: do they lead 4th best?|pg||
nt|hedyg: he was in dummy, what should he play?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: NS lead odd|pg||
nt|drorp: but indeed, 1 way or another, declerer will make 9 tricks |pg||
nt|atabey: I'm not so sure. this can easily go down|pg||
pc|hT|nt|athene: heart to the @HQ and @HK|pg||
nt|athene: and now it looks percentage to finesse the ten|pg||
nt|daman: yes|pg||
nt|athene: unblock @SK first|pg||
nt|athene: still lauria has a bit of a habit of making these contracts, so let's see....|pg||
nt|athene: Lauria might suspect that west has the @HK|pg||
nt|athene: otherwise why no heart back after the @CK>|pg||
nt|athene: ?|pg||
nt|athene: but even if he knew that, i don't see how it would really help that much|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps he will cash the @SK then run the clubs and judge whether to exit @SA, spade|pg||
nt|Walddk2: apart from the overtrick of course|pg||
nt|babs59: THAT was tough to remain focused|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bas will insert result on 16 when he gets a minute. Please be patient|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jtr: Now maybe an overtrick?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that's a relief, then|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That's a "half is glass full" theory Roland by the look of it|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@d would have been 1 or 4, not showing cue in @d|pg||
nt|bagman: hoping that partner has 2 trump tricks|pg||
pc|d3|nt|brgpro: he will get one for sure|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you don't want too many good results like this, though|pg||
nt|andyv:  one specs chimes in with they've been told not to double.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: Bridge World has been discussing this issue for decades i believe|pg||
nt|drorp: even if now A@D, @H to Q, and @S, he can duck, take the 3rd, cash the diamond, cash 3 clubs, and play K@H, N is only left with hearts|pg||
nt|atabey: heart and spade back|pg||
nt|atabey: problem|pg||
nt|drorp: again, he can duck it|pg||
pc|c6|nt|athene: interesting he didn't unblock the spade - now a club return is very bad surely|pg||
nt|bagman: I cannot believe that Tesla ducked the diamond to the danger hand|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|pasker: S can then play the 4th round of clubs to promote his 7 of trumps|pg||
nt|yuval10: now it's getting interesting|pg||
pc|cT|nt|gulyas: he can play on @Ds|pg||
nt|cicus: well, yes, @H and @D was equal chance|pg||
nt|hedyg: they lead 3/5 and attitude|pg||
nt|gulyas: I know, I can see all hands|pg||
nt|andyv:  looks like that happened here too|pg||
nt|drorp: it's safe|pg||
nt|toral5: was always interesting on @H lead|pg||
pc|d2|nt|koksoy: they  had  more  then   1.0  butler   ranking  a  few  matches  ago|pg||
pc|c7|nt|sharkey: shud make|pg||
nt|bagman: Now 2x diamonds, @CT and club|pg||
nt|brolucius: Trump promotion.|pg||
nt|sharkey: kib says no..|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: well, just goes to show. Madala the Magician strikes again|pg||
nt|brolucius: You can risk 3@H on some hands with a suit like that, but a bit dodgy with 3-2-2 on the side.|pg||
nt|toral5: u r forced 2 pass c 10,cos of entry probs in dummy|pg||
pc|s3|nt|athene: ok, no reason to get that right|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|bagman: ruff!|pg||
nt|cicus: I only these 4|pg||
nt|koksoy: as  Duboin  -  Bocchi   did  several  times|pg||
nt|babs59: clock watching was my best option :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: S needs to discard Q@h somewhere along the way|pg||
pc|s7|nt|Vugraphznk: Done|pg||
nt|drorp: well now he'll just claim 10 tricks|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|daman: game over|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|toral5: tht south ll do,cos east won h ace|pg||
pc|hK|nt|hedyg: A@s and @s works now|pg||
nt|gulyas: going down now|pg||
nt|hedyg: no|pg||
nt|hedyg: oh yes sry , 9@c in N|pg||
nt|athene: he can still make if he reads the position|pg||
nt|gulyas: N has an entry to the high @H|pg||
nt|athene: although NS have done well to organise the clubs so south doesn't get endplayed|pg||
nt|cicus: but what does S discard?|pg||
nt|athene: yes but if you exit a heart now, what does south throw?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: If he plays @SA @S, he'll have 2@S and 2@D + 5 = 9?|pg||
nt|athene: south is squeezed in three suits|pg||
nt|schtsch: one off????|pg||
nt|corplaw: wow|pg||
nt|frululu: wow|pg||
pc|h2|nt|daman: and Lauria is a careful declarer|pg||
nt|bagman: Rare misdefense by Sementa|pg||
nt|bagman: he probably did not believe that the declarer would take that line with that hand|pg||
nt|bogier: Bal chyba uzna³, ¿e pas partnera jest forsuj¹cy??|pg||
nt|lechcold: Bertheau sporo ryzykowa³ licytuj¹c nieforsuj¹ce (chyba) 3@S..ale blef siê uda³|pg||

nt|atabey: now yes|pg||
nt|yuval10: here it comes|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|othered1: and their auction is what we'd see from many standard system players.  Some weak NTers might get to 3N after 3@S by east, but from the other side.|pg||
nt|brolucius: No, he would have lost three trumps tricks when trumps were breaking very favourably for him.|pg||

pc|cK|nt|toral5: now down|pg||
pc|c9|nt|athene: if he throws his club, he will get endplayed|pg||
pc|d4|nt|Walddk2: Scoring up: "We have 430" .... "How did you make an overtrick in 3NT"?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: as 1@c can be a balanced 19-23, I reckon South thought that that was what North had, and that he would bid with any other type|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: No one at the table was sure of the score lol|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty Bas|pg||
nt|brolucius: US kibitzers find the word 'dodgy' amusing or perhas archaic. Has not yet crossed the Atlantic, it seems.|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I don't know what happened, the computer froze up completely and all I could do was pull the plug, figuratively|pg||

nt|andy_h: They say that one of the top conventions that creates the biggest swings comes from the Lightner Double. If you and your partner ever wish to take this (brilliant) convention on, ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: make sure you have clear agreements of when it applies and which suit does it imply|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Director has been called|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Apparently Bocchi held the @s9 before leading a @D|pg||
nt|Walddk2: what now?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Hofta called the TD|pg||
nt|andy_h: held or led?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Did his partner see @S9?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: According to Bocchi he held, according to Hofta he put it on the table, the tray was closed at the time|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: The tray was only opened after the @D lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So what is the problem?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Chaos describes it aptly atm|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Tray = screen|pg||
nt|andy_h: if the screen was closed then there should not be a problem at all. This is one of the main advantages of playing behind screens!|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: According to Hoffa, Bocchi almost put down the @S9, he wanted to put dummy down and then Bocchi changed the card|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So facts are disputed|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It happens|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I, personally, didn't see a card before the @D|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I'm not sure if Bocchi has disputed showing the @S9 as a lead to Hofta|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In those situations, the TD *can* ask a spectator if he so wishes, but it rarely happens|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: He did|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bas is a spectator in this context|pg||
nt|rodvenn: this is being discussed now in the press rooms with very good expert TDs present|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Please kibs, I am impartial in this, I'm only reporting what I see and hear at the table, I have no hidden agenda|pg||
nt|rodvenn: they think the 9 of @s may be a playd card|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Of course, no-one would ever question your integrity. You are just a neutral observer|pg||
nt|andy_h: Bas is too busy flirting to take notice of what's going on lol|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Btw, Madala and Charlsen were to the bathroom|pg||
nt|antoniz: ale dla nas:):)|pg||
nt|andyv:  3@s vs 3@d contracts|pg||
nt|iain sime: Not the most expensive misguess for game.|pg||
nt|stc: less expensive than expected...|pg||
nt|petergill: Suddenly Italy have a big lead|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I'm pretty sure I've never had a pass before while operating on VG, but I've had two yesterday and this is the third :)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: this often happens in the 2nd half of a match I noticed|pg||
nt|hedyg: sry all|pg||
nt|athene: very hard for declarer to read but not impossible|pg||
nt|hedyg: i ignored the 9@c in N|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Late comeback for the Italians?|pg||
nt|athene: you have to ask, firstly, what hand could south hand to lead from AJxx in a minor (yuck!)?|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: Antek - to mo¿e cos z Twojego konika - FP?|pg||

nt|babs59: yep|pg||
nt|andyv:  any slam here for EW?|pg||
nt|babs59: not one you'd want to be in surely|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: here, as I am just a kibitzer.|pg||
nt|ziff:  Still playing fast at both tables. This will give us a chance to see the last boards again in other matches :)|pg||

nt|schtsch: brick started falling from the roof?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: E discussing the hand now|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Wondering out loud how NS could defend this way|pg||
nt|rv: Italians well set for century here, unfortunately no bonus points (Vps) for scoring 100 IMPs in 1 session:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Italy's lead reflects very solid play|pg||
nt|hedyg: played the hand short in @s for longer @cs, not absurd|pg||
nt|stc: 124 IMP on 18 borads, what a show !|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 124 IMPs exhanged in 17 boards; it definitely has not been boring|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I have the auction and play for 16 written down up to the claim, I will show it after board 20|pg||
nt|athene: *could south have|pg||

nt|mdgraham: yes|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 3NT is a fun contract|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok|pg||
nt|athene: if you decide south is fighting to avoid an endplay maybe you can get it right|pg||
nt|bagman: P, X or 1@H?|pg||
nt|toral5: hi|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Our matches in round 2 (all from the open series in 1 hour and 35 minutes) are: Italy v Turkey, Norway v Croatia, Sweden v Denmark, Netherlands v Spain, and Portugal v Poland|pg||
nt|bagman: He was right; there was no legitimate chance to make it|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Guaranteed make, pretty much|pg||
nt|mbruun: He will get the diamonds right and make it for sure |pg||
nt|bjacobs: Have to bid it first, though|pg||
nt|hedyg: bd 14 10 imps to Italy|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: And 2 without @S cue? 5NT?|pg||
nt|bagman: NS have only 7 tricks in diamonds because of the bad diamond break|pg||
nt|andyv:  vul should allow W to come in|pg||
nt|hedyg: NS can play 2@H|pg||
nt|stc: Let us hope a 6-5 this afternoon|pg||
nt|Gerben42: italian lead, not passout|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Sementa taking a look at all the hands now|pg||
nt|petergill: Playing Italy for 20 boards is tough - the relentless pressure of their accuracy |pg||
nt|jkotor: pewnie graj¹ nowoczenie: 2@d transfer= s³abo/GF, 2@h = porz¹dne|pg||
nt|paulg:  if they knew about boards 14 and 15 then they might worry|pg||
nt|bagman: sure|pg||
nt|paulg:  1@h seems normal .. 3-5 majors too diverse for double|pg||
nt|bagman: South stole EW's 44-fit|pg||
nt|petergill: NS have 4@H, and EW might save in clubs I guess|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@S=5+@S+4=minor|pg||
nt|schtsch: how can he play this way?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: u mean not take pitch early?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Tesla: "I played it bad" Bocchi: "Yes, you played it very bad"|pg||
nt|rv: looks like another fairly flat board here|pg||
mb|3H|nt|hedyg: 4@H, cue in @H maybe in @s as well|pg||

mb|p|nt|atabey: and some luck too :) anyways they are far the best in europe|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Some might X with the N hand because of the 4@H, anyone else?|pg||
nt|capercliff: ws 14 doubled?|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes|pg||
nt|brolucius: This is a deal where 10 Italian bids may pay off.|pg||
nt|bagman: in the days of old when vugraphs were theaters one of my frinds was playing a tough contract. In a critical situation he heard the chanting from the theatre: "DROP IT, DROP IT" and ...|pg||
nt|bagman: played for the drop|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the best result is 4@D dbl less 1 = -100|pg||
nt|pasker: I think W was likely to bid at all vulnerabilities|pg||
nt|bagman: Here my suggestion did not help N|pg||
nt|brolucius: There have been some instructive bidding boards. Perhaps the most valuable lesson is that you should not take a gamble that is destined to lose.|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@D= a major suit|pg||
nt|yuval10: 3@h probably invitational|pg||

nt|brolucius: USA have a poor record in the bridge Olympiad.|pg||
nt|andy_h: 1NT = (14)15-17|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Bocchi tried to Charlsen, who stated he didn't mind. Then Hoffa asked for the screen to be closed|pg||
nt|sharkey: Canape style OR may have complicated matters|pg||
nt|petergill: A spec wisely pointed out that 12-15 is too wide as a 1NT range = very good point - that was part of the problem|pg||
nt|schtsch: i don't think bad is the right word for that|pg||
nt|toral5: pd can b as gud as @H void|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: no raise to 3@H from North|pg||

nt|stc: The so-called MultiLandy, very more and more popular|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2NT is four card heart raise|pg||
nt|bagman: Philosophical question, with a hand that bad as S has, showing 12 cards instead of 5 with a single call might be a good policy|pg||
nt|petergill: North did well to bid 3@H opposite 14-16|pg||
nt|mdgraham: won't matter here, but you can play transfers after that sort of overcall, to get the stroing NT hand being declarer.|pg||
nt|yuval10: 4@s too.... but can't see any play for 4@h|pg||
nt|toral5: so unfortunate tht @C are blocked|pg||
pc|c5|nt|hedyg: S has too much to pass :(|pg||

nt|brolucius: South's 2@H was to play in partner's major. That is why North did not pass - South had not shown hearts.|pg||
nt|hedyg: @d lead and a @C back?|pg||
nt|iain sime: Woolsey I think is another name for it.|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I always thought the only difference between ML and Cappeletti is the reverse of 2m (2@C in Cap is the 2@D in ML), is that true?|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@S = some sort of good raise to 4@H|pg||

nt|rodvenn: What the experts say here is that the fact that the screen is down does not automatically give Bocchi the right to change.  |pg||
nt|Walddk2: No|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I've seen players change cards and calls behind screens, I'm not sure if that's in accordance with the rules though|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes Iain, depending which side of the water you are on :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2@C used with only 3 trumps|pg||
nt|rv: Swiss ladies could lose another IMP here if Italians take their top tricks|pg||
nt|toral5: he ll b forced to win and play @S|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|hedyg: lucky 3NT with no entry to the W hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes and another hand with little to comment on|pg||
nt|babs59: yes correct - but I guess you can correct the score for us?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: There is no reason to|pg||
nt|marlowepi: at the point where heart queen was led, it was not unreasonable to play small. he had to take pitch earlier|pg||
nt|wstuart: lol|pg||
nt|corplaw: contract cold for 7 on 4-2 diamonds|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes|pg||
nt|yuval10: now he's down|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @CA, small @H to K! and @SK|pg||
nt|toral5: he was always down..|pg||
pc|h6|nt|bjacobs: He isn't, but if partner is moving away from NT, Duboin will agree |pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: If E did intend 3@H to let W choose, W didn't take it that way|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Why not?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Didn't he choose?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: He just said 3@H probably was half a stop|pg||
nt|bjacobs: oh|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Denying 4@S anyway|pg||
nt|andy_h: But that doesn't refrain them from the 1NT opening - they also have another edge, that is, it is pre-emptive. If you hover your mouse to the open room score on the top-left, you ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: can see the auction from the Open Room. Versace also opened it 1NT|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Usually, when a player decides to allow/disallow a screenmate to change a call/card, it's dependant on personal relations|pg||
nt|sharkey: not sure - but West's raise to game seems very conservative|pg||
nt|Gerben42: even have time to let the strong hand play it|pg||
nt|cicus: another struggle for 9 tricks is coming|pg||
nt|bagman: MIght treat that Kxxxx as a 4-carder|pg||
pc|h3|nt|hedyg: why not bid 2NT?|pg||

nt|hedyg: same lead as OR|pg||
pc|h2|nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 4@H-1 is the match score|pg||
nt|andyv:  it looks like NS agreed to -1|pg||
nt|yuval10: could've made it before that , double-dummy|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|vasmar: now diamond lost|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: There's actually a VG theatre here, but it's well isolated from the playing area :)|pg||

nt|lesniak: fajnie zaczyna bal- prowokuje do grania w atu|pg||
nt|petergill: as long as you are not the sort of people who forget your system |pg||
pc|sK|nt|Walddk2: But as I understand it, N and E don't agree as to whether @S9 had been played or not. Anyway, that's why we have TDs; it's for them to sort out|pg||
nt|bagman: bad minors and bad shape|pg||
nt|antoniz: karo proszê,a widzisz wiara czyni cuda:)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Dbl by lauria at 2@s is a raise in @D in decent hand|pg||
nt|bagman: North did not support so surprise attac might work. And now it does|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer has 9 tricks, though|pg||
nt|paulg:  with the marked heart finesse|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s4|nt|hedyg: in OR W passed and left th bidding open for opps|pg||
nt|brolucius: In Turkey-Switzerland there was a noble push in 6@S bid and made.|pg||
nt|babs59: I thought you said both sides agreed to -2, Bas|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|andyv:  a fast claimer... could actually make 4 if he believes E's dbl showed @hs|pg||

pc|d2|nt|bjacobs: Could that lead divert Sementa?  (Thinking it's a singleton ...)|pg||

pc|hA|nt|bagman: Push by NS?|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|petergill: Yes it was|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: It does mean that|pg||
nt|athene: the lead looks natural, but there is a school of thought which says it's not good to lead a risky 4-card suit against 3nt|pg||

pc|h9|nt|hedyg: Bocchi could not bid double since that would show 5m+4M|pg||
nt|lesniak: moze tak naprawde trza bylo grac|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer needs to cash the @DA now|pg||
pc|c2|nt|othered1: I'd have no choice on north's hand -- getting my long suit into the auction is paramount.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The TD will give a ruling at some point and inform the two sides about their right to bring his decision before an appeals committee within a stipulated time frame|pg||

nt|Gerben42: Lebensohl|pg||
nt|Gerben42: surely will be denied|pg||
nt|gulyas: its hard to see N leading a @D against game|pg||
nt|fabsayc: wow, 2s is overstrength|pg||
nt|skorchev: it's makeable on any lead|pg||
nt|bogier: 1@D= piki|pg||

mb|3H|nt|hedyg: 3@D?|pg||

nt|andyv:  not now|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 4@S are possible also without K@H lead, if South don't play @h but @D|pg||
nt|bagman: No heart lead now|pg||
nt|brolucius: Bold double by South.|pg||
nt|hedyg: S led A@H in OR and switched to the A@c!|pg||
nt|brolucius: He is looking for a sacrifice somewhere, but doubles instead of 4NT in case partner prefers to pass.|pg||
nt|stc: another big point !|pg||
nt|brolucius: Presumably North will pass.|pg||
nt|hedyg: trying to find a bid..|pg||
nt|barnets: in 3N defense have to try and stop dec making the 9th trick|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 3@D = 18+ with @D|pg||
nt|barnets: he has 8 toppers with 3 hearts|pg||
nt|Gerben42: Sementa will start liking his hand now|pg||
nt|petergill: North loves to bid, but 3@S seems too pushy, to me|pg||
nt|Gerben42: will be Sementa thinking|pg||
nt|petergill: I wonder if it's N or E who is thinking?|pg||
nt|Gerben42: pass than 3@S isnt the kind of strategy on this hand|pg||

mb|p|nt|othered1: 3N would be easy on @S lead.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but 3Nt is the best spot|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@S Dbl 3@S Dbl All Pass might be the auction at one or two tables|pg||
nt|fabsayc: no surprise that south passed|pg||
nt|skorchev: with @C lead you take with @CA, play @D|pg||
nt|andyv:  makeable and able to bid it are 2 different things|pg||
mb|4S|nt|brolucius: North only worth false preference to 2@H.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it's important to get yur prefixes and suffixes in the right place  |pg||

nt|cumino: Or Ruff @H and play A@D and @D|pg||

nt|bjacobs: Well, she gets access to dummy's clubs, but not too clear what to throw on them|pg||
nt|paulg:  what would an undisciplined player call?|pg||
nt|babs59: this has chances because North will lead a spade|pg||
nt|andyv:  and N will get off to wron glead|pg||
nt|andyv:  wrong lead|pg||
nt|rv: yes agree elimination ensures no @c guess|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: This will make, too.|pg||

nt|petergill: Gerben's words are Very Important Advice|pg||
nt|petergill: the "or forever hold your peace" bit, I mean|pg||
nt|barnets: needs very good defense to beat this contract|pg||

pc|h6|nt|rodvenn: easy to get carried away by the trumps and aces. A heart splinter should slow things down|pg||

nt|iain sime: Italy have turned a handy plus (probably) into minus.|pg||
nt|hedyg: he still had a @d loser and 1@s? how did he make 11 tricks?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Magic.|pg||
nt|hedyg: looks like he should have lost 1@H, 1@s and 1@d|pg||
nt|athene: right|pg||
nt|andyv:  somehow, needing 3-3 @d AND the Ace of @D on side AND trumps not to be 4-0 seems like a huge parlay|pg||
pc|cT|nt|Vugraphznk: Lauria had his pass on the tray then took it back, haha. Gotta love screens|pg||
nt|hedyg: he might double to show the value of the 1NT opening|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: "No bid"|pg||
nt|hedyg: depending on agreements|pg||
nt|hedyg: but that was when Bas had written 12-14 |pg||
nt|hedyg: he corrected that|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: lol|pg||
nt|rodvenn: well stopped|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's a very poor slam; too much wasted in hearts|pg||
nt|antoniz: zwyciêstwo bardzo nas cieszy, a zaczê³o sie niespecjalnie:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: lol, S and W just compared hands and decided the result|pg||
nt|koksoy: play  is  easy|pg||
nt|schtsch: @h10 is well positioned|pg||
nt|corplaw: making 3N will put croatia at 24-6 for match; |pg||
pc|c3|nt|bagman: N has troubles if they play odd=encouraging on the diamond switch|pg||
nt|petergill: Ew have few losers, but they lack tricks - 5@D on non trump leads might make 2 H's, 1 @C and 8 @D's I guess|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@H is interesting too|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Duboin: "Disgusting"|pg||
nt|babs59: yes - needs to ruff out the @CA too|pg||
nt|andyv:  pretty easy from here|pg||
nt|drorp: double looks classic|pg||
pc|c5|nt|daman: 2@S = 19-21|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|Gerben42: heh|pg||
nt|cicus: S had a chance to X|pg||
nt|yuval10: T@d from S now?|pg||
pc|dT|nt|daman: 3NT = 5@S  4@C and not 3 @Hs|pg||
nt|iain sime: Bro Paolo would have made 12 ? :)|pg||
nt|bagman: without the trump lead declarer ruffs 2 spades and loses a trump trick in the process|pg||
nt|yuval10: very nice|pg||
nt|yuval10: declarer has to make some decisions now|pg||
nt|yuval10: J@d would be good if N has KQ @D|pg||
nt|yuval10: he can play J and duck, but yet again, he'll have to guess to play Ace in the 2nd round|pg||
nt|yuval10: not easy at all!|pg||
pc|d3|nt|bridge_one: and @c|pg||
nt|Gerben42: what can he do|pg||
nt|barnets: if he can make 5@H tricks 4@D and a club |pg||
nt|barnets: seems a lot|pg||
nt|Gerben42: esp the combination of making 5@H and getting the @D through|pg||
nt|barnets: with the @D 4-1|pg||
nt|barnets: if the diamonds split|pg||
nt|petergill: The play looks complex - I hope the defence do not let Duboin's reaction affect their concentration (i.e. make them assume that the contract is hopeless)|pg||
nt|barnets: would have better chance|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: True|pg||
nt|rnmalik: win the 2nd @D and makes.|pg||
pc|d4|nt|othered1: On @H lead, don't you get @H pitch on @S?|pg||
nt|rv: essential for West to switch to @d now, wd Jennifer|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|hedyg: ohhhhh N didnt split his @s honours!|pg||
nt|yuval10: in the CR declarer played @s in the 2nd round and in N it's impossible to challenge declarer with a @d continuation|pg||
pc|d5|nt|bogier: z " O" PC ciê¿ko cos wyci¹gn¹æ w licytacji|pg||
nt|pasker: S will need to play a @H through at some point to avoid N being potentially endplayed|pg||
nt|athene: a trump or club ace would keep them alive, but spade is normal|pg||
pc|d2|nt|daman: this is a Roland slam which just might come home   even with the bad trumps|pg||
nt|bagman: anyhow, this is going to be double digit swing for Italy|pg||
nt|Gerben42: if you can ruff 4@S in dummy and @D 3-2 you would get 6 or 7 @H perhaps|pg||
nt|petergill: I predict 4@h will fail and will take a very very long time to be played|pg||
nt|Gerben42: he will try that I guess|pg||
nt|cicus: dangerous though it may have been|pg||
nt|athene: double of 3@D would have worked very well, yes :)|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jtr: I rather prefer the 1NT rebid by South What do you think?|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|brolucius: He was obviously considering it. No idea, really, which is better.|pg||
nt|jtr: Limits the hand and has nice honour holdings to be led round to|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes.|pg||
nt|brolucius: You have persuaded me.|pg||
nt|jtr: Damn I was hoping to get you into an arguement:)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Discuss it with David Burn if that is what you want...|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: Haha, I see where you're coming from David|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: either way it's a whole bunch more to Italy|pg||
nt|sharkey: Trump return seemed natural|pg||
nt|sharkey: 2nd trick|pg||
nt|brolucius: In case the final deal is very exciting, or over in a few seconds, I will take this opportunity to thank our wonderful VG operator, Bas. Many thanks!|pg||
nt|bagman: Does west believe that the @DK sits in where it is?|pg||
nt|hedyg: was taking a nap :(|pg||
nt|frululu: this isnt a good match to watch for people with weak nerves :)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: people with weak nerves shouldnt play bridge at all:)|pg||
nt|schtsch: possible to take 2@s a @h and a diamond before declarer takes his 9|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|daman: E shd duck|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: N knows the @Cs are 5-0|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Looking rather worried lol|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: OR playing 6@C as well, I'm being told|pg||
nt|daman: this will probably take some time|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 36 minutes left on the clock|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Plenty o' that|pg||
nt|daman: beaucoup|pg||
nt|athene: the known diamond break is bad news for trying to set up diamonds or trying to crossruff|pg||
nt|athene: versace might be considering whether he can set up spades|pg||
nt|athene: but the problem is, he has the weak trumps, so he doesn't really want to use dummy's trumps for ruffing|pg||
nt|daman: 6@C -2 in the OR|pg||
nt|daman: he will finesse a H first|pg||
nt|andy_h: This will be 11 imps to Italy|pg||
nt|hedyg: probably being upset about the A@c play|pg||
nt|hedyg: why not @s back?|pg||
pc|s7|nt|bagman: Especially after the lead|pg||
nt|brolucius: Thanks as well to my fellow commentators Carl and Pekka. All the excitement came at the start. I ahve never seen so many big swings in a sequence.|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Thanks David, 't has been fun|pg||
nt|bagman: S did not return a @D so T is unlikely singleton|pg||
nt|bagman: OK, easy|pg||
nt|Gerben42: in other news: Germany 1 - England 0|pg||
nt|barnets: sounds ok to me|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Nice|pg||
nt|athene: but the italian style is not to make many lead doubles|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jtr: I will, just after i finish sticking needles in my eyes|pg||
nt|brolucius: Hah!|pg||
nt|andyv:  that was not right |pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|daman: gag|pg||
nt|stc: good play now, @s helps dec|pg||
nt|bagman: Only safe  re-entry is @HA and heart|pg||
nt|yuval10: guessed well here|pg||
pc|c7|nt|rv: silver lining for Swiss ladies at the end of a forgetable match|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: At least no century|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Yet|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: lol, thx kibs|pg||
nt|rv: yes and possibly get 1 VP?|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|athene: they think it helps opponents more, on balance|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c6|pg||
nt|brolucius: Good tactics psychologically to fail to split spade honours. Makes missing the game look worse. But such clever manoeuvres are better early in a match.|pg||
nt|stc: K@S the last safe exit card|pg||

nt|andyv:  West rushed this a bit... by playing K@D and A@d and then @S, if N ruffs, then she is endplayed|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: lol, 2 scorers and the other operator have asked me about the Board 17 score|pg||
nt|drorp: last hand of this match|pg||
nt|april7: finally a slam|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Grand|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Yes, X is better, because you wouldn't want to bypass 2@S as a contract, and it also implicates minors. 2NT should probably be a 1255 or something similar :)|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|jtr: Hmmm Not really|pg||
nt|brolucius: Could be worse.|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: If the E hand could be my average, I'd sign up|pg||
nt|jtr: They might play it in 1NT just for you David|pg||
nt|hedyg: if S had bid 3@h (splinter) then maybe......|pg||
nt|hedyg: last board of this match now|pg||
nt|mdgraham: last board. It's been pretty unavailing for the Lithuanians, I'm afraid|pg||
nt|paulg:  an excellent performance so far by Scotland|pg||
nt|brolucius: South clearly thought that 3@C was conventional at the other table.|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Isn't the W hand a LV 2@D opener?|pg||
nt|hedyg: we will be back in 72 minutes|pg||
nt|brolucius: He must have thought North held both majors. But you would expect 3@D would be explained as showing hearts.|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes it is he upgraded|pg||
nt|brolucius: There is not space here to explain the full reasoning behind the 7@C bid.|pg||
nt|stc: 7@c in OR was intended as choose between @c and @s but not understood as such|pg||
nt|stc: 6@d was simpler to understand|pg||
nt|hedyg: he could have tried 6 @s...|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Versace possibly thought 3@D was natural too, because of the explanation he got that 3@C were both majors|pg||
nt|brolucius: Bocchi-Madala will expect to handle the North/South cards somewhat better.|pg||
nt|iain sime: Might be a pick up v. 7@H !|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why would you give partner that choice when he already selected spades? By a jump even|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: South and West are screen mates|pg||
nt|petergill: Exactly what Latvia wanted, a few more imps for a nice respectable result about mighty Italy|pg||
nt|barnets: for specs interested I have a new website with lots of interesting material - look at some of worlds best ever players and extraordinary bridge taleshttp://www.s...|pg||
nt|barnets: henkinbridge.com/Entertainment/Default.aspx?categoryID=3|pg||
nt|athene: yes, x of 3@D might be t/o of hearts anyway, rather than showing diamonds|pg||
nt|hedyg: special thanks to our specs for joining and for your kind and helpful comments,we hope you enjoyed the show|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Thanks Hedy, it has been a real surprise :)|pg||
nt|athene: although i am not sure that's the best way to play as a passed hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty Bas for a great job as we come to our last board of this set|pg||
nt|petergill: On Bd 19, EW are in 4@S at the other table - will it go down?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: N just said he expects the OR to be in 4@S|pg||
mb|p|nt|antoniz: lol|pg||
nt|paulg:  Last board of the day and Wales will have a tenser day tomorrow after this result|pg||
mb|1H|nt|brolucius: They might get overboard to keep the Italy supporters happy.|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: I'm with you on that one Andy|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty Bas for great job|pg||
nt|rodvenn: Norway has bid 2 slams on questionable values. |pg||
nt|brolucius: Not a very good game. Let's see if the Italians can stop low.|pg||
nt|bagman: 4@H is quite awful contract; can EW stay out of it?|pg||
nt|antoniz: a 4pik|pg||
nt|vasmar: maybe Italy doesn't get 25Vps|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thanks to Bas, great job as usual!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And to all our excellent commentators|pg||
nt|stc: perhaps was not sure about 4@s, natural or short ?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Mossop alerted 3@D but then took it back|pg||

nt|yuval10: will be very interesting matches until the end of this championship|pg||
nt|rnmalik: No doubt:)|pg||
pc|d5|nt|brolucius: May not be so easy to keep low when the heart fit is found.|pg||
nt|jtr: I suppose West might cue now|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: lol, wb|pg||
nt|andyv:  1600 viewers here... thanks to all the specs for joining us and helping us with their comments and questions|pg||
nt|bagman: Easy bidding followed by easy play, I guess|pg||
nt|hedyg: we will be back tomorrow morning at 9 30 local time|pg||
nt|andy_h: And an interesting rebid from Bocchi|pg||
nt|bagman: East migh value his KJ a bit too much|pg||
nt|stc: W opened 2NT, you have 5@ss, hard to believe that partner has 5+@s and no @c fit !!|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I am not sure whether Zivkovic alerted 3@D, I would assume so|pg||
nt|cumino: 2@S seems makeable|pg||
pc|d7|nt|daman: thanks to Bill Frisby and Tezcan Sen for their analysis|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Be advised: we're starting one hour earlier tomorrow, 9:30 AM local time and 8:30 AM London|pg||
nt|tez: ty all:)|pg||
nt|jkotor: 3@h x -1?|pg||
nt|petergill: A very easy 620 to finish|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: One of the few times where the CR has more kibs than the OR. Must be the excellent commentary :)|pg||
nt|rv: some play 1n from South as sandwitch nt showing other 2 suits|pg||
pc|dT|nt|jtr: Having already shown a minimum|pg||
nt|bagman: @SA @HAK club |pg||
nt|bjacobs: Can he end in a blaze of glory?  The bidding is very informative|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It seems hard to believe that GIB thinks 4@S can make, but there it is|pg||
nt|jbgood: another good result for Italy coming in now - 3 NT in the other room was "a bit" high..|pg||
nt|bagman: Not exactly the friendiest of layouts for W|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the open of 1@D would work better here|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: "Lauria has left the table"|pg||
nt|Gerben42: if they pinpoint the @S problem...|pg||
nt|petergill: 2NT forcing|pg||
nt|gulyas: 3@C makes|pg||
nt|skorchev: oopsy, I didn't saw the pass of 1@S by South, sry|pg||
nt|jkotor: bo kontra na 3@c chyba ze wzglêdu na opozycjê kierow¹|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: S and W predicting the auction now :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Saying N will bid 3@D - X - 3@H - p - p - X - ap|pg||
nt|bogier: oj, Bale juz ich chyba nie wypuszcz¹|pg||
nt|jkotor: S i W próbuj¹ przewidzieæ licytacjê|pg||
nt|andyv:  the Italian team has played very well... the Irish tead did have some chances|pg||
nt|mdgraham: looks like just three losers |pg||
nt|petergill: 4@SX would be 500 I think|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|brolucius: 4@D a cue-bid with heart agreed.|pg||
nt|bagman: Normally they would be nice but facing this bad suit they are not that useful|pg||
nt|brolucius: Not easy to stop low because there are so many hands to be covered by relatively few sequences and it is not possible to discover that much about each hand.|pg||
nt|bagman: Getting plus here is worth 8 IMPs|pg||
nt|bagman: Going one down is worth 3|pg||
nt|brolucius: East must at least be thinking about passing 3@H.|pg||
nt|hedyg: Mossop might wake up now to the transfer?|pg||
nt|hedyg: no|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: But Mossop didn't wholeheartedly|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Please stick around as I will show the missed board 16|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok we will!|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Mossop explaining now that 3@D was undiscussed|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So the 1700 will not be that costly; this is only a question of an overtrick or not|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6 or 7 IMPs|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Mossop saying he took 3@D as constructive with @D|pg||
nt|iain sime: Italy have missed the save , but will still pick up 7 imps or so.|pg||
nt|hedyg: you dont expect opps to overcall 2NT thus dont discuss your bids in case they do?|pg||
nt|stc: 6@s probably -800|pg||
nt|hedyg: push opps into making grand?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 6 or 7 IMPs won't matter for the VP score: 21:9|pg||
nt|athene: now 4nt|pg||
pc|sK|nt|brolucius: East still sees at least two holes unless partner can bid again. Well bid.|pg||
nt|jtr: East has too many hooles to be interested even if the @d cue was the Ace|pg||
nt|jtr: holes|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, they bid it well. (Famous last words as West raises to 6@H...)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And West has done enough too with his aceless hand|pg||
nt|jtr: lol|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He already encouraged with 4@D|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, but he does have five trumps, which makes the singleton spade a little more attractive than it would otherwise have been.|pg||
nt|brgpro: what is W thinking about?|pg||
nt|jtr: Bidding a 'Roland' slam|pg||
nt|brolucius: Maybe what he should bid next.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If East can't take an initiative over 4@D, West can't bid on in my opinion|pg||
nt|hedyg: we will be back in 75 minutes|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Thanks Hedy, fellow commentators and kibs! I can only hope you liked it as much as me :)|pg||
nt|bagman: Fast 11 tricks|pg||
nt|stc: then 7@s for -1100|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I was going to say, this type of 1NT overcall is rather rare where I come from :)|pg||
nt|athene: ok i thought they play 4nt shows even number of keycards|pg||
nt|athene: their card says they play modified turbo when clubs are trumps|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Was 4@D a cuebid for @C or was 4@C a cuebid for @D?|pg||
nt|athene: for anyone who hasn't met that, the idea is, you bid 4nt with an even number of keycards |pg||
nt|athene: since 4nt as rkcb isn't much use when clubs are trumps|pg||
nt|atabey: and what is 4@s|pg||
nt|athene: that would be good defence against 6@C, if hearts not 3-3 - don't try to cash the second spade, but switch to a diamond, to kill the entry to dummy|pg||
pc|s5|nt|atabey: TY Hedy my colleges and spectators|pg||
nt|brolucius: bravo!|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but in italian system 1@D means 4+cards unbalanced|pg||
nt|andyv:  something wrong with a system that misses the 5-4 fit for the 5-2|pg||
nt|bagman: 2@C artificial, I guess|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Vugraphznk: My pleasure Roland, I enjoyed it :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Next round in 50 minutes|pg||
nt|xenya: thanks everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Italy v Slovakia|pg||
nt|jbgood: bye all |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Lebanon v France|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Austria v Netherlands|pg||
nt|andy_h: In an uncontested auction, N/S play some form of gazzilli after 1@D-1M-2@C showing either a natural club suit or 16+|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Israel v Ireland|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Italy Slovakia 2-3? :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Denmark v Sweden (women)|pg||
nt|andy_h: either 1NT is 12-16 or Bocchi "downgraded" to 12-14 based on his singleton spade. Triple-four-one hands are always hard to bid|pg||
nt|cicus: 2NT doesn't|pg||
nt|andyv:  N did think about it.  S did bid 2@s on his own so he is pretty sure S has 4 @s and nothing else.|pg||
nt|skorchev: looks like North is short of entries to take all finesses|pg||
nt|koksoy: bye..|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|jtr: But 6 is rather too good for him|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and he realised that eventually|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thanks all, back in 1 hour and a wee bit|pg||
nt|Gerben42: impressive|pg||
nt|petergill: They pinpointed the spade problem, as one expects from these Italians|pg||
nt|gulyas: 2NT may not|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: cos odrobimy|pg||
nt|corplaw: declarer can make this with good reads|pg||
nt|schtsch: @cK and a @s for discard|pg||
nt|rv: here 1n shows 16-18 and nice safe contract of 2@s reached|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|Gerben42: playing like this they are among the big favorites|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Another 4@H by EW in a 7 card fit :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: surely 2NT was not natural|pg||
nt|athene: 2nt is a bad spot, as usual|pg||
nt|jkotor: pik do skrótu?|pg||
nt|bogier: :)|pg||
nt|antoniz: dziêki, do us³yszenia:)|pg||
pc|s7|nt|mdgraham: that's not the best possible start...|pg||
nt|iain sime: thanks Bas and all. Bye. |pg||
nt|hedyg: 64 minutes :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Thanks Iain|pg||
pc|s6|nt|snetram:  Moim zdaniem E powinien walczyc - 4NT|pg||
nt|bogier: Polki przegra³y Francuzkom 5 pik X w tym rozdaniu|pg||
nt|andyv:  in Belgium|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: England - Ukraine have only compared 4 boards!|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|brolucius: Good entertainment today - an excellent set of boards.|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes lots of fun :(|pg||
nt|barnets: http://www.shenkinbridge.com/    some asked me to repeat|pg||
nt|Gerben42: again from Duboin|pg||
nt|athene: i don't know how NS play it but most experts treat all these 2nt bids as artificial, usually showing two places to play|pg||
nt|cicus: without @Cs N has only 6 tricks|pg||
nt|jkotor: gib mówi, ¿e to chodzi|pg||
nt|bogier: pozory myl¹|pg||
pc|h8|nt|antoniz: czemu nie przez kiery?|pg||

nt|pasker: maybe versace could have chosen to play in @Ds instead|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty Bas for your wonderful work and ty Barbara, it's been a pleasure.  And a big thanks to all the specs who make this a most enjoyable way to spend a couple of hours.|pg||
pc|hT|nt|snetram:  5 trefli - praktycznie bez jednej|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Duboin probably had his reasons to pass|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|andy_h: In the Open Room, the Norwegian N/S pair had an uncontested auction to 3NT after North decided to reverse with 2@H|pg||
nt|sharkey: may make if guess @H|pg||
nt|skorchev: maybe some problem with Bridgemate?|pg||
nt|schtsch: just made|pg||
nt|corplaw: croatia on way to a blitz|pg||
nt|schtsch: @c goes on @s|pg||
nt|yuval10: and he did|pg||
nt|yuval10: so 2@d , @c and @h to lose|pg||
nt|yuval10: 1 imp for NET. but +17 to Iceland in the end|pg||
pc|c5|nt|Vugraphznk: Thank you all, be back later, good night Andy :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty Bas|pg||
nt|andyv:  good night all|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 70-68 isner|pg||
pc|c3|nt|bagman: Well guessed|pg||
nt|bagman: Now he makes for 8 IMPs|pg||
nt|andyv:  not sure how he could do it|pg||
nt|petergill: Thanks to Matthias Berghaus and Mike Graham for their comments and to Bas for being one of the best operators around|pg||
nt|mdgraham: second that|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Thanks Peter, and thank you for your sharing of your wit with us despite the late hour :)|pg||
nt|petergill: Anyone know why Versace doubled 3@S instead of simply bidding 4@H?|pg||
nt|ziff:  And to Peter and all the kibitzers, who keep us busy and make it fun|pg||
nt|mdgraham: possibly to show two places to play |pg||
pc|cQ|pc|c6|pg||
nt|petergill: He was a passed hand - perhaps he was showing a maximum 4@H bid in case slam was on?|pg||

pc|cK|nt|jtr: A close well-fought match|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes they are not doubled yet|pg||
pc|c7|nt|jkotor: ale ju¿ -1|pg||
pc|c4|nt|hedyg: OMG!|pg||
nt|hedyg: will they ever stop?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: its over|pg||
nt|gulyas: he was not sure they have a @C fit?|pg||
nt|bagman: The trump lead is helpful. Declarer draws trumps and sets up the clubs|pg||
nt|mdgraham: although holding five hearts 4@H is likely to be as good a spot as any - also, East might be enormous and EW may have a slam |pg||
nt|ziff:  They always keep slam in the picture....|pg||
nt|mdgraham: thanks all.|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I think he wouldnt mind if partner passes with say 2344|pg||
nt|petergill: Thanks to EBL and to anyone in Ostend Belgium who made this broadcast possible|pg||
nt|ziff:  Thanks all, one more round to go in the qualification|pg||
nt|petergill: Results at http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/10Ostend/Results.htm|pg||
nt|rv: I like Sandwitch NT here though it doesn't work out on this deal, if you play natural my preference is min of good 16-18 for this bid|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: Panie niestety poleg³y z frnacuskimi Madame narazie jest minus 20|pg||
nt|jkotor: chodzi o to, ¿eby N nie przebil 2 pików|pg||
nt|jkotor: a Cezary dok³ada do wszystkich trefli|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: But that's an important IMP|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|jkotor: brawo Adam!|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|sybarra: still cant handle it all |pg||
nt|bagman: Now declarer can get two diamonds the tricks he makes from trumps|pg||
nt|pasker: it is difficult to know when you don't know what 2m would have been over 1NT|pg||
nt|bagman: In the end N might get endplayed but the contact is probably down at that time|pg||
nt|atabey: anyways. its a dream to reach 6@c on this deal|pg||
nt|april7: but W thought a long time before he passed|pg||
pc|hK|nt|daman: ciao all|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Thanks, be back tomorrow|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: The TD's here now|pg||
nt|antoniz: a my 11 lew|pg||
nt|hedyg: -2 either way|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well these were 20 simple boards, the play here was not fast to the point of creating errors|pg||
nt|andyv:  http://tinyrul.com/ebc-open-b    http://tinyurl.com/ebc-open-a|pg||
nt|atabey: england and polish bid this slam. ty specs|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Thanks all, we'll be back in a little over 30 minutes|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: (Iceland - Netherlands)|pg||
nt|athene: thanks all :)|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|brolucius: It was worth a think, since partner had forced to game opposite a blizzard. Slam would have been OK if the @DK was the @DA, but West could see which honor he had (on close ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: inspection).|pg||
nt|andyv:  When E denied @hs, maybe he shoudl have pulled 1N to 2@d|pg||
nt|andersk: wd|pg||
nt|schtsch: 25|pg||
pc|sA|nt|jtr: I had to get a hyphen in during the session just to please DB|pg||

nt|jtr: Thanks for watching everyone  TTFN|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: Thank you, be back later :)|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|sharkey: and a tie score 2nd half|pg||
nt|brolucius: A classy plus score by the Italians to end the session. |pg||
nt|bagman: It's seldom that at this level a pair stops in 3@H in an invitational sequence when vulnerable|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Sementa played the "played card game" again|pg||
nt|sharkey: I understand Bas and the Dutch play Slovakia next game in football - so good luck to both teams :)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 2@D by Versace seam more effective after 1nt by Lauria|pg||
nt|pasker: W likely to make 3 more trump tricks|pg||
