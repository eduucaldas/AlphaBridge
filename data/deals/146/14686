nt|Vugraphznk: Do they actually use it as the Icelanders do?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, Duboin can tell that South will not hold the @SK as well as the values shown. Otherwise he would have responded. A text-book example of reading the cards. Well done.|pg||

nt|bagman: Are EW polishing their methods?|pg||
nt|ni hao: he is recovered,it seems|pg||
nt|andyv:  E might have made it tougher on declarer by ducking the @d|pg||
nt|andyv:  that should be a good score for Ireland|pg||
nt|babs59: EW have 4S here, but NS have a vulnerable save available|pg||
nt|petergill: If South opens 1@D in 3rd seat, as many Souths would, the final contract is probably the same|pg||
nt|schtsch: in football, of course|pg||
nt|athene: it was tough for declarer because even giving north the @SQ didn't put him up into a 1nt opener|pg||
nt|lechcold: cz:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Your commentators are Vladimir Ivanov, Bill Frisby and Barnet Shenkin|pg||
nt|jillan:  there arn't even any squeeze positions so|pg||
nt|milton_se: would like to know who are playing EW in the OR|pg||
nt|jillan:  lLauria Versace|pg||

mb|1H|nt|Walddk2: Good morning everyone and welcome to Ostend in Belgium|pg||

nt|andyv:  S started with a 3 loser hand and ended up losing 4 tricks|pg||
nt|athene: east will have a choice in third seat between 2@C and 3@C|pg||
nt|april7: depends here what W will do over 1NT|pg||
nt|drorp: he knew diamonds were 6-3, questions was weather south has 1-4-6-2 or 2-2-6-3, went for the 1-4-6-2 to justify his 3@D bid, I guess|pg||
mb|1N|nt|Walddk2: Sorry about the delay|pg||
nt|mbruun: Italy has not been as dominating as they usually are in this event, but they are still my favourites for the title|pg||

nt|henryb:  slovakia just scored on Italy|pg||
nt|xenya: first blood to Italy -- in the OR 4@H was declared by S|pg||
nt|brolucius: But, er... I'm sure Duboin would also have made it, had he been declarer. |pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|sharkey: In OR S showed both M over opening 1@C bid and NS bid the @H game for 11 IMPs|pg||
nt|pasker: Bocchi and Madala bid to 5@D in the open room|pg||
nt|pasker: which went one down|pg||
nt|mamos: NS appear to have a comfortable game here|pg||
nt|hedyg: pass????|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 1@C strong|pg||
nt|barnets: 4@S likely contract but cards not well placed for declarer|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 1@D negative, then Sementa no doubt with some 2-suiter|pg||
nt|andyv:  7-11 raise with 4|pg||
nt|rv: I presume East did indicate mild slam try by transferring at 2 level and jumping to game, West should have bid on with all controls and vital @SQ|pg||

nt|athene: 4@S not such a bad spot here|pg||
nt|barnets: italy gain an imp for overtrick|pg||
nt|tokay1975: so if they  win 1 more big score the opponents  may give up for the first seat |pg||
nt|haans: Hi all and welcome to last day for Senior bridge This match plus two more |pg||
mb|d|nt|petergill: EW Convention Card http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/May/OpenTeams/italy/duboin-sementa.pdf|pg||

nt|toral5: i think israel is 2nd.but some 14/15 vps seperate thm frm italy.|pg||
mb|2D|nt|atabey: board 1 was a push. after a 1@s opening|pg||
nt|othered1: 2@D opening by EW, would show a strongish balanced hand.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Tough hand for N/S ... actually 6@C is a good contract, but it might not make|pg||
nt|sybarra: do we have a web site for these trials? |pg||
nt|mbruun: 6 D on a clubfinesse|pg||
nt|sybarra: or this tourney |pg||
nt|hedyg: Piper showing a lot of respect for the 7-4 hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Versace asked me to tell him when anything would happen Henry|pg||
nt|mamos: 4@h looks best|pg||
nt|sybarra: in the opens I think Austria beat England if I am not mistaken |pg||
nt|iain sime: South has judged he is too light for a Michaels cue bid at red.|pg||
nt|hedyg: they just took the lead from Iceland|pg||
nt|athene: south can double this, as a passed hand, i think|pg||
nt|hedyg: used to qualify with 1 match advance|pg||
nt|jkotor: dzieñ dobry, pomóc w komentarzu?|pg||
nt|corplaw: 4H likely to make|pg||
nt|drorp: sorry 2-3-6-2|pg||
nt|athene: 1@H 1@S 2@D 2@S a possible start|pg||
nt|yuval10: lolol|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 18-19 balanced yes|pg||
nt|capercliff: unfortunatley Scotland do not have a team in South Africa|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: He's not looking too pleased|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Both pairs fairly natural methods - NS strong NT and three weak twos, EW strong NT, weak 2M, 2@D=18-19 balanced |pg||
nt|robinswr: 12-15 is a large range|pg||
mb|2H|nt|rodvenn: yes. Boye transferred first to spades and then bid hearts|pg||
nt|ugis: 3nt might be better|pg||
nt|andyv:  right now Italy is in 2nd and Bulgaria in 4th in the A group.|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@H, 4@s and 3NT are all fairly comfortable making contracts. Another quiet board? |pg||
nt|april7: transfer and 2 @H will end the bidding|pg||
nt|rhelle: 1NT shows a good 12-15; they pass bad 12-counts|pg||
nt|tokay1975: they have  good system and they find dia fit 44 sometimes  better to play simplier  |pg||
nt|jillan:  4@S is good bridge....1 down....|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Is 2 down better bridge then?|pg||
mb|d|nt|Vugraphznk: I wouldn't consider it with Jxx and Qxxx M anyway, even if I could open weak 2, would you?|pg||

nt|hedyg: what has W judged?|pg||
nt|stc: 5@d has some play here|pg||
nt|barnets: 3N certainly has more chance of success|pg||
nt|toral5: easy make here|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphznk: I imagine there being a banner on www.eurobridge.org|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: The URL is in my profile as well|pg||
nt|bjacobs: In 6@C, if you can avoid the heart lead, you can even lose the club finesse and maybe make.  As it turns out, there are other issues involved|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/10Ostend/Ostend|pg||
nt|bjacobs: In fact, 6@C on this layout will make on a heart lead!|pg||
nt|mbruun: 4 NT should suggest 6-4 here, while 5C is 5-5|pg||
nt|capercliff: Bas, tell him they are down by 3 goals already!:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Better to not go than to go like the French|pg||
nt|jbgood: 2 @d normally at least invitational in clubs|pg||
nt|bagman: I used to play Romex in 1981, then the opening was called Mexican 2@D (bal about this strength)|pg||
nt|stc: and, once ops are fixed on @s, 3NT is an easy make|pg||
nt|brolucius: West should have every reason to be nervous about this auction - having not shown his values at all.|pg||
nt|hedyg: how many times can you pass with 10 hcps opposite an opening?|pg||
nt|iain sime: 3NT would have made in practice.|pg||
nt|Gerben42: both hands 4333... should be in 3N|pg||
nt|athene: now a quiet 3@D from north - no interest in big things facing a passed hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  EW able to bully NS out of this auction.|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Heya Mike|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I think 2NT is either 7-9 HCP with 4@H or 10-11 with 3@H|pg||
nt|schtsch: can madala pass this?|pg||
nt|schtsch: i doubt it|pg||
nt|schtsch: whats 3@c?|pg||
nt|schtsch: minimum?|pg||
nt|frululu: 5@d cld be a good save agg 4@h here,but how to bid it ?|pg||
nt|drorp: pass denying 3 hearts|pg||
nt|rnmalik: As the cards are placed 2@S has a good chance of making.|pg||
nt|athene: 2@C Gazzilli or a transfer i suppose|pg||
nt|jillan:  ;)|pg||
nt|milton_se: why not even making?|pg||
mb|3D|nt|Vugraphznk: NS seem to be a tad agitated...|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: 9 tricks not imemdiately visible|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: and nothing to play for in the red suits .. so see this drifting -1|pg||

nt|sybarra: those are the sites I have  |pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2C drury? apparently not, judging by the 3H call|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@H overcall might encourage South with well placed AJx to try 3NT|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: Roland Wald|pg||
nt|babs59: 5C makes for EW if no H switch early enough!|pg||
nt|rv: stiff @DA is not very good for offense and maybe East could have contended herself with only 3@h|pg||
nt|rhelle: so you can call it 13-15 which they upgrade|pg||
nt|jillan:  I think they may very well make it|pg||
nt|viren169: Pushy bidding here....|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Hey Gad, Hans :)|pg||
nt|viren169: Hi|pg||
nt|haans: opening bids get weaker and weaker|pg||
nt|haans: Germany play Precision|pg||
nt|viren169: England need all the imps they can get to have any chance of qualifying|pg||
nt|viren169: Germany in 6th position|pg||
nt|haans: England 14th|pg||
nt|viren169: Not sure what 3@D was...|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: It wasn't alerted on either side of the screen|pg||
nt|viren169: But I suspect North will bid 3N|pg||
nt|haans: first pass bu S: Leave me alone 3@D natural|pg||
nt|viren169: Especially if 2N is played as lebensohl here|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: If I'm gonna open west's hand, I'd like to bid 2@D.  But that's a big if.|pg||
nt|babs59: I meant for NS|pg||
nt|athene: interesting that versace goes very quietly indeed with his nice 15 count|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt isn't so bad, is it?|pg||
nt|ppiglett: 4 matches plus this one to go - lots can happen. remember the last round of prequalify - Croatia beat Italy 25-5 |pg||
nt|toral5: agree.1 single digit score for italy means very close rankings.poland and iceland also very close|pg||
nt|tokay1975: sure  everything possible i agree|pg||
nt|toral5: but we sd admit without a doubt tht these italians are super tough|pg||
mb|p|nt|kiwi_joker: If he had enough entries, he could lead spades from dummy 3 times for a very positive outcome (West covering first two times) .....|pg||
nt|andyv:  the 4 of @s just too big a card to overcome|pg||
nt|barnets: well done|pg||
nt|koksoy: as diamonds are 2-2  contract  depends on  heart guess|pg||
nt|petergill: Sorry we cannot explain what the bids mean|pg||
nt|ziff:  Versace will surely try for slam, but the 5-level should be safe, as a @D ruff is with the natural trump trick|pg||
nt|schtsch: ok, a push|pg||
nt|schtsch: if not a club lead :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2@C shows diamonds, they don't play Gazzilli|pg||
nt|barnets: poor choice of contracts|pg||
nt|athene: this was always a danger - now on a club lead east will just duck to maintain communications|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Board 1 will be flat|pg||
nt|yuval10: a swing here|pg||
nt|viren169: Not sure I like 3@D with Txxx|pg||
pc|h7|nt|jtr: 2@s shwoing a minimum hand with @ss and @cs|pg||
nt|jtr: showing|pg||
nt|boz_: ala fantunes|pg||
nt|petergill: The play of 3@DX corrected to 3@HX is hard to analyse, if South went for blood|pg||
nt|schtsch: ah 3@c is some sort of relay it seems|pg||
nt|rv: I would X 3@D as game try if @DA was elsewhere|pg||
nt|barnets: a club lead defeats this|pg||
nt|athene: and declarer has nowhere to go, other than hoping for 4-4 clubs|pg||
nt|jillan:  They bid 7@D at the ither table so no swing|pg||
nt|yuval10: quite tough to see NS making their contract|pg||
nt|haans: not good odds|pg||
nt|peachy: just needs to find CQ|pg||
pc|h2|nt|xenya: good stop, good lead|pg||
nt|bagman: E has soft values but he has so much of them that he has to at least invite|pg||
nt|brolucius: A recent book recommended a 5-4-3-2-1 point count (5 for aces, 1 for tens) when responding to 1NT. That would upgrade the value of the East hand.|pg||
nt|hedyg: no they dont open 1NT with 5 card majors|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I can't hear what they're saying exactly, but it's not Puppet I believe|pg||
nt|hedyg: i think 2@d denies 3 + cards in @H|pg||
nt|bagman: West has a good hand: aces and kings and the only Q in the suit where it surely works|pg||
nt|antoniz: kontra w 2pik powinna pokazywaæ lepsz¹ rêkê,moim zdaniem|pg||
nt|gulyas: EW lead 2nd/4th|pg||
nt|athene: can't see declarer finessing the six of trumps so this will lose two clubs, three trumps...maybe he will finesse spades too for a heart pitch|pg||
nt|athene: unless east gets endplayed somehow|pg||
nt|wstuart: probably shows any min?|pg||
nt|athene: i guess versace can anticipate that south will be able to hold up a diamond card and just kill the dummy|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|mamos: NS play 4 card majors|pg||
nt|marlowepi: presumably will rise and play a spade|pg||
nt|hedyg: or he will ruff out Q@s maybe?|pg||
nt|andyv:  should make this|pg||
nt|peachy: or not give trick to it, rather|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|jtr: Looks like 9 tricks or so with the lie of the cards|pg||
nt|atabey: zorlu will have to guess @hs|pg||
nt|othered1: Personally, I'm not big on semi-psychic openings and would prefer to have some defense if I open.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Or "can" make|pg||
nt|mbruun: Good save by the Italians. East unstopable after the thin overcall|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Anyway, 5@S doubled is a pretty normal outcome|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Esp with @S, the Italians like to come in at the 1 level|pg||
nt|mdgraham: EW basically natural with a srong NT. NS play the NASZ system|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i predict down one|pg||
nt|corplaw: 4H could be down if declarer misguesses everything and def gives no help|pg||
nt|haans: yep but @CQ-third at wrong hand|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|jtr: However, 8 might not be so easy:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: but nothing in their CC|pg||
nt|bagman: About 25 yars later it has been resurrected|pg||
nt|lesniak: oczywiscie jego istotnoæ polega na tym ,¿e wynik tego meczu bedzie sie liczy w finale|pg||
nt|bagman: The heart guess is getting no easier|pg||
nt|bagman: because S needs @HA for his opening more or less|pg||
nt|viren169: Trump lead usually works better on this type of auction|pg||
pc|c2|nt|athene: finesse must be better odds surely|pg||
nt|hedyg: a 3rd seat minor preempt is not necessarily weak|pg||
nt|athene: trump switch now would not help the defence, of course|pg||
nt|ziff:  I suspect 2@C was an artificial gameforce, 2@D may be balanced or nor @H support|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@C likely a general GF, perhaps 2@D = not three hearts. Just guessing though|pg||
nt|petergill: EW quickly established that slam was poor. The 2@D response to 2@C looks like it showed a minimum hand |pg||
nt|ziff:  Great minds all think alike ;)|pg||

nt|sybarra: bid 1 looks like severe punishment |pg||
nt|hedyg: so he either has 4@ss or no major|pg||
nt|petergill: The bidding makes picking the @D's fairly easy|pg||
nt|andyv:  don't see how... 5@hs, 2@s and at least 1@c|pg||
nt|schtsch: don't think 3@c can be minimum|pg||
nt|schtsch: how do they play 3@h then?|pg||
nt|schtsch: 3@h is obviously minimum, 3@c some relayish|pg||
nt|ahri: 3@c could ask which option it is if 2NT is what Bas suggests. I'll take a peek in their CC.|pg||

nt|brolucius: Hi to the kibitzers!|pg||

nt|brolucius: The proposed new point-count system had two big flaws, as I see it. (1) No-one wants to have a 60-point deck and to need 34 points to open 2@C. Too difficult to count that high. ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: Also, you don;t know whether you will end in NT during the early bidding, so impractical to upgrade the Q/Js, which will have less value in an eventual suit contract.  |pg||

nt|sybarra: little frisky agst the Italians in the other room maybe|pg||
nt|athene: that's interesting shot - playing his partner for the ace of spades, hoping for @SA and another, and now declarer would duck, fearing the switch was a singleton|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 3@h shows a stiff @D|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3@D+2@S=5 I can only see 5 tricks for the defense. 2@S also when @H is played by E after 3 rounds of @D. The key card is the Q@C.|pg||
nt|athene: let's see if they find 4@S in the other room|pg||

nt|mdgraham: well, 4@H was mildly unlucky|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I like the 2@C overcall, but West's raise to 3@C was more dubious.  Whatever, the Italians had booked a gain by stopping in a partscore|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but there is a question of whether 2@H in the actual sequence is (a) sign-off (b) invitational (c) forcing|pg||
nt|barnets: it would certainly have been more interesting to watch peter|pg||
nt|Gerben42: not so clear at this vuln to prefer defending|pg||

pc|s5|nt|marlowepi: had trumps been 4-1 the second heart would have ben fatal, but there would have been chances by leading a spade|pg||
nt|brolucius: Possible intra-finesse in clubs.|pg||
nt|gulyas: it was not a bad idea, it was just wrong here|pg||

nt|bagman: Declarer is likely to draw trumps now|pg||
nt|yuval10: he does|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Most would play (a) ... but North might raise anyway.  The 4@H bid seemed to be "a lot"|pg||
nt|robinswr: strange that north is not playing on clubs|pg||
nt|toral5: will make only 2 now|pg||
pc|s6|nt|brolucius: Yes, some ******* has stolen my address book and is sending adverts that seem to come from me.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: for example, you can play 2@H as invitational and 2@C as a puppet to 2@d, so that 2@H is then pass/correct |pg||
nt|marlowepi: probably N judged that if trumps were 4-1 E would not have led a singleton|pg||

nt|rhelle: he plays it safe|pg||
pc|h8|nt|athene: overtaking the @S10 must mean lauria has the @S9|pg||
nt|drorp: 4 off, they'll make 3 more heart tricks with a cross ruff|pg||
pc|d2|pc|h4|pg||
nt|drorp: well, not a cross ruff, just ruffing a @C with the @H9|pg||

mb|p|nt|jtr: Quite a result  Doesnt look easy to make 12 tricks with the distribution|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@s was alerted... must be intermediate values?|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't believe it's weak:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: That's what I thought, Fayad explained it as weak though|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Anyway the awkward preempted sequence has placed them in a Moysian where the split is frtiendly|pg||
nt|mbruun: Declarer lacks entries for the double hook in diamonds, så with this fortunate lay-out, 12 tricks are possible. 4 H as the Italians reached is a decent spot as well|pg||
nt|hedyg: that might have worked|pg||
nt|lesniak: E powinien wznowic- ale widac ze sie boj¹ naszej pary|pg||
nt|pasker: I assme this is keycard from N, some pairs use transfers at the 4 level to bid RKCB and use this sequence as quantative|pg||
nt|bagman: 13 by setting up diamonds|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@D re-transfer|pg||
nt|hedyg: NS CC: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/May/OpenTeams/italy/bocchi-madala.pdf|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2@D is 'transfer or special sequence'... whatever that means.|pg||
nt|barnets: reasonable but 3N would have won the marbles|pg||
nt|petergill: Good stop, as cashing out against 4@S is fairly easy|pg||
nt|athene: still i am surprised all the top italian pairs seem to like it so much|pg||

nt|lesniak: dziwie sie ze nie padlo 4 karo- przeciez partner mogl byc wyraznie mocniejszy|pg||
nt|bagman: If this is pure penalty X, Sementa is relying on a club ruff|pg||
nt|drorp: N chooses to pass 1@D, not many would these days, passing hands like this might get you down in 1@D when you're cold for 4@S, but worked here|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: I imagine 3@C being Puppet Stayman after which LV reverse 3@H and 3NT|pg||
nt|daman: Hi Billand Roland|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: So 3@H denies 4/5M and 3@S is a puppet to 3NT after which N may offer minors|pg||

nt|bagman: Declarer is likely to lose two hearts and a late club|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I wouldn't like to defend either|pg||
nt|milton_se: I would, since I play 2S = weak 4+5+|pg||
nt|peachy: since he was bidding game anyway|pg||

nt|athene: he might not do that - he doesn't know his partner has the @SK|pg||
nt|barnets: north looking at 4 def tricks in his hand if partner has the @SK|pg||
nt|toral5: 3nt has a lot to do aftr a @H lead and twice duck|pg||
nt|rhelle: can't see the 9th trick|pg||
nt|toral5: ya|pg||
nt|robinswr: very unlikely to make 3nt|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bertil is not a junior|pg||
nt|othered1: 3N is perfect contract, NS|pg||
nt|toral5: comfortable 3nt here|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I'd bid 2@S, 0-4 6+@S|pg||
nt|othered1: I couldn't resist bidding on east's hand.  NS (obviously) don't promise great @S length for their takeout doubles|pg||
nt|peachy: E will decline, but it would have not cost anything to try|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|capercliff: acurate defence is down 2 i think?|pg||
nt|pasker: looks like they will be playing slam now|pg||
nt|bagman: Against Irish slam Versace would know what to do|pg||
nt|andyv:  Versace not one to be timid on leads|pg||
nt|pasker: Looks pretty tough to lead a @C from Versace's hand|pg||
nt|bagman: "First you cash your aces and kings, then you cash your partner's aces and kings and the you wait for two trump tricks"|pg||
nt|andyv:  Goran style?|pg||
nt|bagman: The club lead can be very very wrong |pg||
nt|bagman: if the slam is bid on marginal tricks|pg||
nt|hedyg: still seem to be playing puppet though|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 3M after 3@C must be something else then :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: i dont understand why you would play puppet when 2@d denies 5M|pg||
nt|andyv:  hard to avoid 2@s and 2@h losers|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: witamy Krzysztofa Martensa|pg||
nt|bagman: N is worried that the @SK is wrong|pg||
nt|athene: 1@D is a bit less likely to be short than 1@C|pg||
nt|athene: but even so, most would be responding|pg||
nt|toral5: this means they stopped wel looking at the cards and lot of hcps|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Great decision by Lauria. |pg||
nt|rhelle: and that is with the @sJ dropping and the minors splitting 3-3|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|andyv:  he can be very passive|pg||
nt|andyv:  and he is|pg||
nt|andyv:  now a matter of guessing the @hs|pg||
nt|andyv:  a none @h lead might influence declarer|pg||

nt|koksoy: after @c J lead  which is  taken by D ..  decleare enters dummy with  diamond A then @D ..  enter dummy  with10 of spades then finesse club|pg||
pc|d6|nt|fabsayc: light but effective|pg||
nt|petergill: Against this EW, 3NT would have gone: @D lead to ace, low club - not easy to get it right|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West hasn't promised anything, so 2@S should be a simple competitive effort|pg||
nt|milton_se: certainly not|pg||
nt|jillan:  no but he bids like one.....  :)|pg||
nt|haans: splinters pay as well lead directing|pg||
pc|d5|nt|bagman: Shabby trumps, unlikely to guess the layout|pg||
nt|hedyg: can we switch to 6@c now?|pg||
nt|bagman: because of the overcall|pg||
nt|bagman: and the ruff coming anyhow|pg||
nt|brolucius: Now it is no good to guess the @HA-x because West would get a club ruff.|pg||
nt|bagman: He should play for drop, because he might still have chance to set up diamonds with Qxx hearts and xxx diamonds in the same hand|pg||
nt|athene: declarer might have a bit of work to do here|pg||
nt|snetram:  witam wszystkich kibicÃ³w|pg||
nt|lesniak: zreszta jesli obrona bedzie chodzic w kiery to raczej 5 karo sie nie wygra|pg||
nt|petergill: The defence has several chances to find the @D switch to stop the overtrick in 3@S|pg||
nt|barnets: leads @SA to find out|pg||
nt|robinswr: 13 opp 12 stopped low|pg||
nt|peachy: The price is cheap if you find a vulnerable slam that way|pg||
nt|yuval10: i think 3@h is a far better bid, you can bid 4@c over 3@s ( pattern )|pg||

nt|capercliff: 8|pg||
nt|andyv:  but he can avoid all that if he plays on @ds|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, but it did not neecessarily show hearts to begin with|pg||
nt|hedyg: Daniel it says quite clearly: no 5card M|pg||
nt|athene: only three obvious losers - spade, heart, diamond|pg||
nt|athene: but if declarer pulls three rounds of trumps he might be a bit short of trickss|pg||

nt|ziff:  I confess that I would have rebid @Cs and then doubled the inevitable @S bid on my left|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West's 3@C is based on the fact that he has quite a lot (five-card suit and a known-to-be-useful @HK) |pg||
nt|yuval10: but you have the bonus of finding the @h fit|pg||

nt|mamos: well  no very exciting|pg||
nt|drorp: 2@S appears to have 4-5 losers, 2 spades at most, a diamond and 2 clubs at most, so he will make it, maybe 9 tricks if taking a correct view in clubs|pg||

nt|gulyas: first blood to Italy for the extra down in 3@D bd2|pg||
nt|ziff:  I d rather emphasize @Cs than 432 in @H|pg||
nt|ppiglett: West showing 5 diamonds and three spades and South only trying 2H, leaving West with three hearts and thus two clubs. 3N didn't look good.|pg||
nt|peachy: depends on methods, what 3H would mean. If natural, then great. If Help Suit Try, then he can't bid 3H|pg||
nt|yuval10: for EW it surely a long trail bid|pg||
nt|haans: or WC|pg||
pc|c3|nt|bagman: Now declarer can take the 3rd spade in dummy and take a club finesse for the contract|pg||

pc|cT|nt|iceblue: 3@H ¸ãÏÞÆÆÌ×|pg||
nt|brolucius: With hearts not being 3-2, he seems to be a trick short.|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: 1 up with the @H finesse?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: But cashing out is probably better in Teams|pg||
nt|tokay1975: needs to ruff  small|pg||
nt|tokay1975: but i thk he will not|pg||
nt|toral5: many lines available for play here|pg||
pc|cK|nt|marlowepi: doesnt even need it as cards lie. could just cash winners and exit in clubs|pg||
nt|barnets: good choice of lead by north- had west one more diamond and one less club north had to lead an ace to beat the contract|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|pasker: Declarer likely to play for trumps 2-2 as has an extra chance if 3-1 of setting up @Ds for a 2nd @C pitch|pg||
nt|bagman: He should have gone up the @SA to have late entry to hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  E has easy exits|pg||
nt|athene: but now declarer can change tack and play the clubs|pg||
nt|drorp: maybe some sort of trump coup possible, double dummy i think even 10 tricks are possible|pg||
nt|athene: this is a common dilemma for the defence - if you play trumps, declarer uses a side suit|pg||
nt|drorp: A@H, A@D, @D ruff, @H ruff, @C to T, and K@C|pg||
nt|toral5: does 4@S has some play?cos @D breaking wel|pg||

pc|h5|nt|Vugraphznk: Hey George btw, and thanks :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Anyway, declarer will play the overcaller for the @HA.|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: True, but the @H finesse is more elegant :)|pg||
nt|athene: you normally hope that an early ruff is from the trump length|pg||
nt|athene: when it isn't, there can be problems|pg||
pc|hT|nt|Vugraphznk: N had the slightest of pauses before playing @DQ|pg||
nt|sybarra: may just play the !'s right now|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Here's another: For all the auctions bilateral spikes own color in a highly ³ ¶ you three and four are based on the fit ± colored partner (9 cards in the colors of bids) |pg||

nt|Walddk2: spikes|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: lol|pg||
nt|bjacobs: well, it's not exactly "full disclosure"|pg||
nt|sybarra: sounds like a volley ball game description |pg||
nt|bjacobs: Duboin really has a serious problem here - if that queen is singleton, which the odds suggest, he needs to cross to dummy to finesse diamonds|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I think I'll settle for the ECATS system document: available from http://www.ecatsbridge.com/Events/ebl/2010ostend/default.asp|pg||
nt|bjacobs: As it turns out, even if he does that, he will make, because then the 3-3 club break is revealed|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not every day i see someone say "the finesse is the more elegant line of play"|pg||
nt|athene: if declarer plays west for the @CJ|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|othered1: Again, open room reached the same contract after a different auction.   Good efforts to stop at 2|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So I think he might indeed take the club finesse now|pg||
nt|gulyas: @H now|pg||
nt|athene: apart from anything east may now be endplayed|pg||
nt|athene: of course we can see he isn't :)|pg||
nt|gulyas: true|pg||
nt|athene: when he switches to a heart, will declarer decide the @HK is wrong, and try to ruff it down?|pg||
nt|athene: ok, maybe he is considering a trump|pg||
nt|hedyg: when declarer refuses to play trump.........|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer can ruff the 4th club in dummy now|pg||
nt|toral5: guess 7 frm europe|pg||
nt|haans: ty :)|pg||
pc|hK|nt|hedyg: @c ruff, draw trumps and run 9@H worked|pg||

nt|andyv:  good point Pekka|pg||
nt|barnets: if the @DA was true then west has the @CAK|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Oh well|pg||

pc|c2|nt|Walddk2: You can't help feeling sorry for declarer|pg||

nt|mamos: ACTION|pg||
nt|brolucius: I see that it means that when responder continues with 2@S over the requested 2@H, this has a special meaning. (Some players use that as Baron, looking for a 4-4 minor-suit fit).|pg||

nt|athene: 2@S gives east a slightly awkward decision|pg||
nt|athene: 3@H is very committal on such a modest suit|pg||

mb|d|nt|bjacobs: well, it's only mild ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 500 point save in 5@S|pg||
nt|bagman: NS have started by bidding quite aggressively. It's a reasonable strategy when being an underdog|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@C Precision|pg||
nt|snetram:  Holandia, Austria i Anglia|pg||
nt|drorp: Ultra agressive opening|pg||
mb|3H|nt|daman: bidding 3@H would be aiming at a very small target|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D alerted because it promises some values|pg||
nt|athene: (2nt would be rubbish)|pg||
nt|daman: he might try 3@H now|pg||
nt|athene: i think east should just pass|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not really worth it|pg||
nt|brolucius: Had West made a weak jump overcall of 2@S and the opponents then settled in 6@C, declarer might play East for the @HA.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Perhaps Slovakians were up all night celebrating.|pg||
nt|bagman: North has some options: 2@D, 2NT, 3@C and 3NT|pg||

nt|rv: pass by West denies 3@s, negative inference for no support X|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: wow Italy not only bid slam but grand on board 1 and made it|pg||
nt|athene: that was a difficult cash-out situation for the defence, last board|pg||
nt|athene: there were layouts where they had to take the trump off dummy and cash a third spade|pg||
nt|rhelle: surely 4@s now?|pg||
nt|othered1: 2@C opening doesn't make it easy, but NS will find their way.  North's shape ensures that.|pg||
nt|idc: Hi Sapan, Ed and everyone|pg||
nt|toral5: will they bid?|pg||
nt|peachy: he has 9 tricks if thee dont lead hearts|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: Looks like fingers on the F5 there|pg||

mb|p|nt|jtr: Transfer response|pg||
nt|jtr: 1@h showing specifically three cards i imagine|pg||
nt|brolucius: West's 1@H rebid suggests three-card heart support.|pg||
nt|andyv:  5 imps to Lebanon on board 3 as they bid 5@hx|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Yesterday Hedy advocated rebidding 2@S as opposed to 1NT on a hand similar to the current W hand because of @Hxx :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  aggressive dbl by Bocchi has put S in a quandry|pg||
nt|andyv:  3@c will probably end it|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Interesting options for Madala here ..he has best hand at table...hasnt said a word yet :) |pg||
nt|andyv:  right... that's the quandry|pg||
nt|bjacobs: so you might as well go for it|pg||
nt|sybarra: I figure, one bid gets this hand off my chest  |pg||
nt|xenya: quite sensible though|pg||
nt|rodvenn: pushed|pg||
nt|rodvenn: we dont know who thinks. probably charlsen|pg||
nt|Walddk2: When fixed stay fixed. Madala thinking about raising I suppose. I don't Charlsen is thinking|pg||
nt|rodvenn: the BBO operator probably cant see on the other side of the screen|pg||
nt|jbgood: my press colleagues here think it is Charlsen who is thinking|pg||
nt|hedyg: Lohay wondering how much his K@D is worth|pg||
nt|bagman: Personally I would have taken the more aggressive 2NT approach|pg||
nt|brolucius: In the open room there was no spade overcall at all, I am told, and declarer guessed the @HA. |pg||
nt|sharkey: On previous hand In OR Madala entered dummy to play @H towards his hand - like he knew E had Ax... - one trump loser only|pg||
nt|brolucius: I don't like 3@C much on those values. 2@D or 2NT looks better. |pg||
nt|sharkey: after @D lead|pg||
nt|bagman: South has a good hand and can see 7 quick tricks|pg||
nt|sharkey: agree David - about as good as he can get|pg||

nt|othered1: I'd guess south will get his long suit into the auction.  3@H has to unconditionally forcing on this auction.|pg||
nt|toral5: 5@C is costly here|pg||
nt|haans: who would bid 4@H here?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphznk: How about no bid?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I'm 18 and even I wouldn't Michaels it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But every time it's not your hand you have given the show away, and there is nothing that suggests that it *is* your hand with the values North has|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Nor any other immediate overcall|pg||

nt|schtsch: they have discussion on 50% of the borads|pg||
nt|haans: 3@C-4@C did the trick|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: France started out this last round with 1 VP more than the Netherlands so if all three teams score 25, France will win and Sweden will end just behind Netherlands|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  only problem with NT... no tricks|pg||
nt|andyv:  S will scramble for 7 tricks|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: 2NT is so seldom natural these days .. have we found a rare example?  :-)|pg||
nt|andyv:  Bocchi trying to decide|pg||
nt|andyv:  Q10 of @s makes him doubt that it's natural|pg||
nt|andyv:  but his minors are pretty sick|pg||
nt|andyv:  passing will probably push the board|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: several kibs think 2NT = scramble|pg||
nt|mbruun: Dbl of a Michaels could be treated as 7+ with 3c support. 2NT or 3H GF with 4c support, and if you have a penalty double just pass 2 Sp and wack them in the next roundat tti|pg||
nt|mdgraham: values? Well, all those fours must be worth something|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: *Tries not to laugh*|pg||
nt|sybarra: no chuckling at the table Bas |pg||
nt|bjacobs: I would pass as well, but the fact is that 5-5's can be quite powerful.  And the opponents don't always nail you, even when they should|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Looks like a playable method, Mathias|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The problem might be if partner intervenes before you get your chance to double|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Where did you nick it?|pg||
nt|mbruun: From Duboin-Sementa|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Another possibility is to double the 2@S bid saying: "partner, I am interested in penalties"|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That might stop partner from making a bid before you can get your claws on the next hand's bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: if only he could get to dummy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: By the way, 2@C shows diamonds as you may have guessed|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: It was Charlsen thinking, Madala had a swift pass|pg||
nt|sybarra: now for the cue bidding|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I count 16 tricks in any contract but @S EW :)|pg||
nt|gulyas: I am happy with the outcome as I am biased, but still surprised at the play|pg||
nt|athene: 6@S is there, but unlikely to be bid|pg||
nt|athene: oh sorry only 11 tricks|pg||
nt|athene: but surely they won't get higher than 4@S |pg||
nt|bagman: EW can make only 8 tricks in hearts|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@C FG 4+@C or balanced|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 2@D is nf with @D|pg||
nt|drorp: i hope 3@C is NF|pg||
nt|drorp: trouble now|pg||
nt|othered1: Ignore that, please|pg||
nt|haans: but some do not|pg||
pc|h2|nt|sharkey: 2@D would also leave more room for bidding|pg||
nt|bagman: Hoping that the cards lay well|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hi Vassilis, welcome|pg||
nt|drorp: Barbosa wants to double 3@S :)|pg||
nt|latwy: ta|pg||
pc|h3|nt|brolucius: 2@D only shows a sound raise to 3@C, so North has plenty for that. Then he can raise to 3@C on distributional values and fewer points (to be obstructive).|pg||
nt|lesniak: lub skontruje 1 ba|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Hey Vassilis|pg||
nt|mamos: i think East has shown 4 controls so West may well be off to the grand |pg||

nt|jkotor: impas karo jest bezpieczny|pg||
nt|babs59: oops|pg||
nt|drorp: he'll double 3NT too|pg||
nt|drorp: maybe even south can, holding a club stop|pg||
nt|athene: south should be close to doubling 3nt|pg||
nt|drorp: and good diamonds stops|pg||
nt|athene: north should have more than just spades, to double 3@S|pg||
nt|athene: if he only had four or five spade tricks and nothing else he would pass 3@S i am sure|pg||
nt|jkotor: a potem S uduszony na kolory starsze|pg||
nt|barnets: perhaps south should have returned a diamond and not a heart|pg||
nt|athene: north's delayed 3@H showing lots of shape but not so many HCP|pg||
nt|barnets: as south knew the third spade was not cashing|pg||
nt|athene: i am not so sure he did - might not north have led as he did from @SAQ5?|pg||

nt|hedyg: 2@c drury|pg||
nt|atabey: 2@c is a version of drury I guess. and 2@s shows a good raise for 1@s-2@s|pg||
nt|hedyg: he obviously devalued the K@d|pg||
nt|bagman: 3NT by N would have made only with diamond lead|pg||
nt|sharkey: cud go 2@D - 2@D - 3 NT|pg||
nt|brolucius: Then East might well lead a major suit.|pg||
nt|sharkey: The way this match is going - Yes|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: I usually play that as 7-9 distr. with 4-5 @S...|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Oh, they play Precision? :)|pg||
nt|gulyas: yep|pg||
nt|koksoy: I dont  think  they  will  try 4@S|pg||

nt|drorp: there must be a reason for P to double a forcing 3@S bid, south should come to the right conclusion, and he does|pg||

pc|dT|nt|sybarra: now does N have stiff ace or q?|pg||
nt|hedyg: disc a @H|pg||
nt|babs59: West could have led 4th highest and smiled|pg||
nt|april7: has to duck 2 @H later|pg||
nt|jkotor: ale trzeba trafiæ po³ozenie K@h  !!|pg||
nt|toral5: dutch gained 7 on brd 2.so they lead by 8|pg||
pc|d5|nt|kiwi_joker: When in, Fayad needs to play A@S .. but Madala has given him impression he could have Kx still left. Always good to put doubt in defenders' minds!|pg||
nt|hedyg: or a @s :)|pg||
nt|schtsch: well, 8:0 is a great start|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: It was North thinking there|pg||

nt|bjacobs: Duboin's comment breaches copyright, doesn't it?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: must have been irresistible|pg||
nt|rv: good stop by Swiss ladies here|pg||
nt|drorp: this can be a big number for NS, they can take 2 clubs 4 hearts and 1 spade, easily|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|athene: east should just count himself thankful that his partner bid diamonds rather than clubs|pg||
nt|mbruun: 11 tricks now. Spade entry for the diamonds |pg||
nt|brolucius: Bocchi bid 2NT on the North cards at the other table. If you put your cursor over the Open Room result, top-left, you can see the other auction. |pg||
nt|marlowepi: our mathematicians in the audience can tell us what the odds are, when you have 2 six card suits, that five of the cards will be the same in the two suits|pg||
nt|marlowepi: they must make astronomical look small|pg||
nt|sybarra: praying for 2/2 @D after @H's dont break or is there another way?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: with 43 club break do not even need to guess Ds or have good luck there|pg||
nt|mamos: yes i was thinking about 4-3 as always its about combining chances|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4 discrads on black suit winners|pg||
nt|mamos: whats the best order|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes I see the club 4/3  maybe easier |pg||
nt|sybarra: I am told 7 sp only 2000, but they you push them to 7 nt most likely |pg||
nt|athene: it was easier for Bocchi in the other room as his partner had jumped in spades in the bidding showing five|pg||
nt|barnets: 3 boards only played italy up by 25,|pg||
nt|tokay1975: dia back now|pg||
nt|tokay1975: best def|pg||
nt|milton_se: D back will make it interesting|pg||
nt|jillan:  I agree with the specs that a @H switsch and the @SJ back MAY be the ultimate play, BUT how will he know what K Nort holds @S or @H|pg||
nt|jillan:  do they have THAT good signals?|pg||
pc|s4|nt|jtr: @h raises show five cards (obviously) and are limit bids|pg||
nt|brolucius: With only 4 hearts and a rubbish hand, East has to sign off in 1NT, 2@C or 2@H?|pg||
nt|jtr: Others play the 1@h rebid as any weak hand which i think is inferior|pg||
nt|jtr: Right|pg||
nt|jtr: Anyway, how is he doing in 4@h?|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: He has to decide if it's KTx or K9x or K8 onside|pg||
nt|jtr: Not as simple as that is it?|pg||
nt|brolucius: North held off his king to give declarer a guess if he held Q-J-9-x-x, but he has given West a chance to pick up the trumps for no loser now.|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: @C aren't splitting so he should ruff a @C in dummy?|pg||
nt|jtr: North did very well not to cover|pg||
nt|pasker: declarer likely to be at least down 2 here, 2@S 2@H, 1@D, 1@C|pg||
nt|marlowepi: have to play trump ace first in case they are 4-0. then king of H, club to ace and club ruff, heart to Q and club ruff, claim|pg||
nt|mamos: you dont want to go off trying to set up Club when Diamonds 2-2 alll the time |pg||
nt|schtsch: for handball of course|pg||
nt|yuval10: but 14 imps for Bulgaria nontheless|pg||
pc|s7|nt|tez: it was 8/10|pg||
nt|andyv:  even with fancy foot work in @s suit, there still are only 7 tricks|pg||
nt|hedyg: claim|pg||
nt|gulyas: Szalay, easily the best player of the team (and probably of Hungary, too, some may say) is a rare sitout|pg||
nt|athene: declarer will probably try to ruff hearts in dummy|pg||
nt|hedyg: i thought Dumbovich was the best on the team|pg||
nt|gulyas: he is expected to play the rest of the matches|pg||
nt|bagman: South might be worried about the result as some might open the N hand and reaching game is then easier|pg||
nt|andyv:  there's no humor in bridge|pg||
nt|andyv:  :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: That wasn't actually a slow duck by Norh|pg||
nt|athene: they aren't getting four hearts |pg||
nt|april7: if N would have taken the ace|pg||
nt|drorp: not rising with @CA is bad, now probably 2 down at most|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: North even|pg||
nt|peachy: well done on defense to keep it to ten tricks, although doesnt matter|pg||
pc|sA|nt|mbruun: Made it easy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Note that Bocchi passed over 1@S at the other table|pg||
nt|snetram:  jestem zwolennikiem teorii Jacka PszczoÅy, Å¼e z dwoma starszymi czwÃ³rkami zawsze daje siÄ Staymana. OczywiÅcie o ile z dwoma starszymi czwÃ³rkami odpowiada siÄ 2 kier.|pg||
nt|drorp: heart is crucial now|pg||
nt|athene: there is an interesting point of strategy here, whether you should lead dummy's suit on these auctions|pg||
nt|april7: wrong pick so 1 down only|pg||
nt|athene: just because partner has the spades held doesn't mean you necessarily are best off leading them at trick 1|pg||
nt|drorp: well now declearer suddenly has 8 tricks, and a disaster board turns to be a normal score|pg||
nt|athene: ok, it is likely to be safe, but not much more|pg||
nt|tokay1975: also if east plays  heart  and  west returns sp jack declarer  can make |pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|latwy: nie piki s¹ na 4 lewy|pg||
nt|idc: I guess NS must have an agreement that South still has to have some tolerance for @s, even when he bids 4@h|pg||
nt|mdgraham: just been looking at the EW CC - relay precision, lots of writing   |pg||
nt|toral5: so italy open their account.where sementa competed up to 3@S|pg||
nt|idc: Otherwise, passing 4@h looks more normal|pg||
nt|othered1: normal strategy of going after the side suit first to protect from being ruffed down.  |pg||
nt|toral5: does 4@H show some cards in @S?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lechcold: 6BA nie jest zbyt piêknym kontraktem, nawet przy treflach 3-2|pg||

nt|hedyg: and the friendly opp led a small @d|pg||
nt|bagman: Now declarer has 9 tricks as he's going to lose a heart; claim time|pg||
nt|brolucius: A kibitzer asks if 46-0 is a record after four boards. Only the all-seeing Great Dealer can answer that.|pg||
nt|hedyg: and Roland?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, sorry, I forgot. Him and Roland.|pg||
nt|bagman: The defense needs to cash out now|pg||
nt|jillan:  no they do not, but this may be a very good play|pg||
pc|d6|nt|vugraphznk: Not anymore :)|pg||
nt|jtr: I guess he will cash the @hA and hope a few @cs stand up|pg||

nt|sybarra: stiff q would have been interesting with N |pg||
nt|Walddk2: But the finesse is with the odds as it also caters to AQx onside|pg||
nt|mdgraham: declarer got a diamond lead and club switch. Misguessed trumps|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: A two-suited overcall would've been less likely with @SQ- I think|pg||
nt|paulg:  well defended but you'd hope that it would be flat |pg||

nt|Walddk2: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/Events/ebl/2010ostend/default.asp  for convention cards and other useful information|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Bocchi had shuffled, put his cards back in, taken a new board, placed the tray and board on the table and took out his cards before EW knew what had happened|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's not a record|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Obermair inquiring about the @D, laughter all around|pg||
nt|brolucius: Playing a two-level response as game-forcing has some advantages, of course. If it didn't, most of the USA wold not use it. But it is not that wonderful. Here, for example, East ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: did not want to cue-bid the @CA (because he wanted to limit his hand) but West was still unlimited.  |pg||
nt|barnets: another 6 imps to latvia when italy reached 4@S|pg||
nt|barnets: on the last|pg||
nt|gulyas: sure, some would say Dumbovich, or Winkler is better, its open to discussion:)|pg||
nt|athene: he had a heart-club squeeze even if east had long clubs|pg||

nt|hedyg: not this time..|pg||
nt|athene: another boring 4major+1 push :) so this discussion can go on |pg||
nt|gulyas: he opted not to play due to personal reasons and work|pg||
nt|hedyg: tough decision|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Interesting: would you try for slam with the S hand opposite a strong 1NT?|pg||
nt|gulyas: but he WAS asked:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: :) of course he was!|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: The board has been put in the wrong way around...|pg||
nt|koksoy: double  difference & one overtrick  is 7 imps  for  Wales |pg||
nt|koksoy: at the  3rd board|pg||
nt|babs59: a reasonable shot by South tho|pg||
nt|petergill: After 16 rounds, EW, who play in all Italy's toughest matches and sat out matches like Slovakia, Latvia and Wales, are +0.46 imps/bd for 11 matches played |pg||
nt|april7: luckyn outcome though|pg||
nt|athene: maybe lauria has been taking lessons from Phil Hellmuth - he too can dodge bullets :)|pg||
nt|drorp: E-W really lucked out here, bidding game with 11 to 9 and a misfit, might still cost them as a normal 3@C contract probably makes|pg||
nt|april7: N will reach 4@S and making+1 losing only 1 @H and 1 @D|pg||
nt|athene: it depends how 3@H plays|pg||
nt|athene: the big danger would be if declarer gets forced too much and can't bring in the clubs|pg||
nt|xenya: or 4@H?|pg||
nt|athene: but i think as the cards lie he should be able to manage things|pg||
nt|toral5: we surely are heading for a gr8 encounter|pg||
nt|rhelle: he'll pass this bad 12|pg||
nt|viren169: same with the club|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: ty Roland :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphznk: In their defence, it was a really quick one|pg||
nt|xenya: Bocchi didn't know 5@C was making but he felt he had to take an insurance in any case|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 55 is|pg||
nt|brolucius: Perhaps Roland is the Great Dealer.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: some of the laughter may be about something else:)|pg||
nt|stc: 5@d was made because the def helped dec to eliminate @h@S, and dec guessed the @c position|pg||
nt|brolucius: In other words, it is difficult for both players to combine getting their strength across and cue-bidding their controls.|pg||
nt|gulyas: its a very nice hand|pg||
nt|athene: you have to be confident to bid 4@H with that south hands|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Or 4@D, if you play SA Texas, I guess :)|pg||
nt|athene: i remember lauria-versace had a misunderstanding in that position in the bermuda bowl|pg||
nt|babs59: and unfortunate that East gets horribly squeezed in 5@C|pg||
nt|babs59: on board 2 the Italians found the 5@C vulnerable save, but EW bid on to 5@S making|pg||
nt|andyv:  S still wondering what to do with her 2 headed monster|pg||
nt|mdgraham: anybody watching who is Welsh may not be too amused at that, Peter :) |pg||
nt|petergill: The favourable vulnerability led Lauria to choose the more aggressive overcall|pg||
nt|frululu: 6@s here ?|pg||
nt|schtsch: a grand on a finesse|pg||
nt|rv: NS could runinto a penalty here|pg||
nt|drorp: now that's more like a 1@S opening :)|pg||

nt|hedyg: a drop of blood, Bas corrected the score|pg||
nt|hedyg: now, now, lets not go overboard !|pg||

nt|ziff:  Preempted the wrong player this time, but white vs. red is too tempting|pg||
nt|athene: 2@C transfer to diamonds|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|hedyg: np Bas|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Damn bridge players, the world would be better off without us :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: N cannot bid inverted 2@d|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes, but no reason to stay out of the game|pg||
nt|rodvenn: did now|pg||
nt|hedyg: send Walddk1 to tennis, Walddk3 to cricket etc|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: lol|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@C 16+ any, 1@D 0-7 any|pg||
nt|Gerben42: may be interesting to note that Madala is a junior player originally from Argentina|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt must show better than minimum, so duboin might get vaguely interested|pg||
nt|fabsayc: is 1@D transfer response or negative?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i am told was transfer|pg||

nt|andyv:  ty Bas|pg||
nt|koksoy: they  are far from  finding  their  spade fit|pg||
nt|petergill: Wales are not in the top five in the section, so my statement is simply stating the facts. |pg||
nt|ahri: 6 is not completely safe either |pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Not if Bocchi doesn't bid 4@H :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: If that's their system :)|pg||
nt|wstuart: a bit less than the 57% which is needed for a grand to be break even.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1NT is 14-16|pg||
nt|viren169: West may reopen|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: Bas!!!!!!|pg||
nt|brolucius: Now Roland is an Englishman (living in London) he will have to suffer like the rest of us when we screw up against Germany. Not that we will, of course.|pg||
nt|wstuart: assuming a small is bid at the other table.|pg||
nt|schtsch: well, this is one of those 5/7 boards|pg||
mb|3D|nt|kiwi_joker: if South could find 3NT on Jx .. it makes|pg||
nt|andyv:  everyone pointing to 3N|pg||
nt|andyv:  and W did miss a chance to really muddle things up by not bidding 3@h on his 2nd turn|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Because the diamond suit is "frozen"|pg||
nt|mdgraham: looks like North took 4NT as agreeing diamonds|pg||
nt|henryb:  you might try 3@s instead. That after all was the purpose of that bid|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Double = 4+ spades|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So on this auction 1@S shows the minors|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2NT relay|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@S seems to be a good spot to stop in|pg||
nt|gulyas: he knows N probably has wasted values in @H - unless he has the A|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: In Rubensohl (the way I play it), 3@H is 5+@S, so 3NT might just be SO or offer to play systematically|pg||
nt|gulyas: with a bad hand and no fit, you could still just bid 3@S|pg||
nt|athene: NS play 3@H is invitational+ so i assume with any minimum north just bids 3@S|pg||
nt|gulyas: now S may get excited|pg||
nt|athene: south might content himself with 4@H|pg||
nt|hedyg: scared to bid 4@H?|pg||
nt|april7: 3 down but possible 4 if ruff in @C isfound|pg||
nt|drorp: I think they will take it now|pg||
nt|drorp: defence is quite straight forward|pg||
nt|athene: or 3nt of course, if you catch partner with an 18 count :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Sorry, he overcalled, so a little more|pg||
nt|jillan:  no it is 15-18|pg||
mb|p|nt|capercliff: 3@s was the ideal bid|pg||
nt|pasker: Do people agree with dble from N?|pg||
nt|lesniak: natomiast wychodzi 5 trefli|pg||
nt|jkotor: ale obrona wychodzi na trafieniu kiera|pg||
nt|snetram:  brawo|pg||
nt|petergill: unless he can find a 10th trick somehow|pg||
nt|barnets: def will duck a @D|pg||
nt|barnets: and thats that|pg||
nt|athene: from the point of view of the club suit it would have been better to make north declarer|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They don't even have to when @CK is removed|pg||
nt|athene: but i guess that's not really feasible|pg||
nt|barnets: right|pg||
nt|athene: declarer won't even go for the diamonds, i wouldn't think - he knows that's hopeless|pg||
nt|athene: he will perhaps run the @SJ hoping to switch to hearts|pg||
nt|xenya: on the previous hand, NS in the other did bid up to 4@H, and EW decided to take a save|pg||
nt|athene: i suppose he might play the @DQ hoping it gets ducked by both defenders, so he has stolen a trick|pg||
nt|jillan:  they made the 4@H a thÂ´a other table so 13 to Italy|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  and my apologies... She missed a chance:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  should make 4|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: You better, I wagered Netherlands - Germany as finals (3-2, of course)|pg||
nt|bagman: Here declarer needs lot of luck to make|pg||
nt|andyv:  this may get expensive|pg||
nt|andyv:  bad trump split and immediate taps|pg||
nt|ahri: on a rounded suit lead you need 4-3 diamonds to throw that other loser, and if finesse of spades won't work you need west not to have fourth diamond|pg||

nt|jtr: for those that are interested|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Also available for those who are not|pg||
nt|Walddk2: :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: I have a Bocchi0Duboin convention card up and 1@S shows diamonds for that partnership. Cannot find one for this partnership.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Oh, I see now that David has found one. That's good.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: two aces + @DQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: South thinks North has shown 5-5 is my quess|pg||
nt|mbruun: South seems to think that partner promised 55|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I assume they have a strong club base, hence the 3@D, and the small misunderstanding|pg||
nt|mbruun: Sry slow typing by me|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Lots of whispering on both sides|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's a really tough hand to bid, to be honest|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@C is 12-14/19-23 balanced, or natural|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Then I don't understand 3@D at all ...|pg||
nt|paulg:  so you play in 3N opposite the @sA and lose the first five clubs with 5@d cold?|pg||
nt|andyv:  no, gives too much info away and hand isn't distributional enough|pg||
nt|bagman: I would not X myself but I admire the courage of those who do X|pg||
nt|hedyg: (as my English husband used to tell me )|pg||
nt|hedyg: they become British, never English|pg||
nt|gulyas: he is not sure where that would take him|pg||
nt|gulyas: 5@S or 6@S now?|pg||
nt|hedyg: so what is 5@C now? fit or cue?|pg||
nt|jkotor: czyli tutaj wynik bardzo wiele znaczy|pg||
nt|bagman: The club lead gives 8th trick|pg||
nt|koksoy: after club  lead..  Sementha  has 8 tricks..  and  will  try  for  jay  jay  squeze|pg||
nt|petergill: North played South for @DJ rather than @DK|pg||
nt|petergill: Find an 11th trick somewhere, I mean|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I'm being told that on board 4 (3NT X-1) Bocchi sits North, declaring 2@SX|pg||
nt|robinswr: only a spade lead will let his make|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@S would have been 2 off, 4@H also going down|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe only 1 down in 3@S|pg||
nt|jillan:  They shouild get their tricks in i n time since the singelton @S is evident in dummy....|pg||
nt|viren169: tough lead...|pg||
pc|dA|nt|jtr: The ecats site is more useful that the tournament site|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is the only slam that does not make. I think 6@C, 6@H, 6@S and 6NT all make|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 6@H?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Oh well, hearts 6-1|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But it's a better contract than 6@D|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Indeed, in fact, I think it's probably the correct contract IN THEORY|pg||
nt|bjacobs: No, perhaps 6@C|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, good luck, North|pg||
nt|mdgraham: guess well|pg||
nt|brolucius: Chance of a slam is not wonderfulo, after the single raise, but typically the Italians will take a look in that direction.|pg||
nt|bagman: Maybe W relayed to see if E had 4-5-1-3|pg||
nt|vasmar: vulnerable no|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't think many do, Ben|pg||
nt|stc: the two black Q's in S will probably score|pg||
nt|lesniak: w pewnym momencie rozgrywajacy bedzie musial trafic czy N ma AKDxxx, Kxx, xxxx, czy aktualna reke|pg||
pc|d6|nt|atabey: thats a surprise. salvo(assael) playes 2@d natural normally. |pg||
nt|tez: first partscore swing i think|pg||
nt|hedyg: E denied a singleton i guess|pg||
nt|bagman: Then there might be a legitimate slam|pg||
nt|barnets: the 12 imps Iatvia gained is when after a natural 2N - North Bocchi looked for a major fit with 4-3-3-3 found one and went down|pg||
nt|athene: ok, going to the 5-level is a very serious statement and duboin will now surely bid the slam|pg||
nt|athene: wow, he didn't, even with all the trumps|pg||
nt|gulyas: interesting|pg||
nt|athene: i guess his rationale is, if north had everything needed he would just bid blackwood himself|pg||
nt|petergill: Could have played @HA, ruff 2 hearts ...|pg||
nt|cumino: On @D lead she could make|pg||
nt|rv: West should have been a bit circumspect after South showed 10+cards in red suits and with void in partner's pre-empt suit|pg||
nt|jkotor: 8 lew jest przez kara jeli trafimy 10@d, gdzie szukamy 9tej?|pg||

nt|Walddk4: Also welcome to Alwyn Jihe|pg||
nt|andyv:  ok, we can get rid of the 3N bidders...Bob's law about 3N was true on this hand.|pg||
nt|rodvenn: an alternative for Charlsen was to double the 1@s bid. but that is not where his honours are|pg||
nt|rodvenn: then Hofta probably would have gone on to game.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Ah.|pg||
nt|andyv:  so the 1@d showd 4+@hs and 3@d completed S's pattern|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Bertheau has a couple of chances, he won't miss it|pg||
pc|c8|nt|brolucius: Yes, but East would then still need a bundle of good cards in the majors.|pg||

nt|lesniak: wlasnie, albo Kx albo kxx albo k10x|pg||
nt|petergill: Can still, as North has not removed a dummy entry|pg||
nt|rv: I expect this to go 1 down since too much work to be done|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|bagman: It might win a partscore but often it gives away info or induces partner to overcompete|pg||
nt|sybarra: does he play ace and spade now?|pg||
nt|brolucius: West limited his hand by not doubling 2NT (which showed a weak diamond raise). East did not have a clear-cut leap to 4@S over the delayed double.|pg||
nt|athene: hmmm ok a wheel has come off here|pg||
nt|hedyg: i dont see that N ever showed @s fit|pg||
nt|athene: if 3nt showed better than minimum, north should back-pedal all the way after that|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: N looks puzzled|pg||
nt|athene: since he has really a bad hand|pg||
nt|gulyas: N bid 5NT to pick a slam I guess|pg||
nt|athene: if north is looking puzzled now,  i would suspect that he thought south had hearts|pg||
nt|hedyg: seems like he was protecting K@H all the way|pg||
nt|athene: but then 3nt makes no sense because he has no spade stop|pg||
nt|gulyas: I think he should have bid 4@S over 4@H|pg||
nt|athene: yes, 5@C was definitely an overbid|pg||
nt|athene: if the auction all means what we think it does|pg||
nt|gulyas: @S stop? 3@H showed @Ss|pg||
nt|athene: but i think there are probably three interpretations of this auction here - north's, south's, and ours :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: where is the undo button?|pg||
nt|gulyas: :)|pg||
nt|athene: maybe four - North's, South's, ours, and the right one|pg||
nt|gulyas: I like where this is going, sry Italians:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Sementa: "I think this is a misunderstanding"|pg||
nt|toral5: 11 on @S lead,|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|iain sime: Meanwhile, East has done too much opposite a balancing double I think. Oh, and come on Germany!|pg||
nt|lechcold: wiem, ¿e w dzisiejszym stylu 11PC i 54 na starszych to prawie dla wszystkich bezproblemowe otwarcie...|pg||
nt|robinswr: on good days the KQ of spades would be on lead|pg||
nt|rhelle: he play low = encouraging on Q and A - so the 3 was very inviting|pg||
pc|dT|nt|gulyas: we need all the imps we can get our hands on|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Italian going on now|pg||
nt|barnets: 4@D was the limit of the hand|pg||
pc|d5|nt|hedyg: i dont like 1NT with xx in @H|pg||
nt|pasker: S could have returned a @S for ruff here at trick 2|pg||

nt|babs59: maybe she thought the 4@D bid showed some 6-6|pg||

nt|kiwi_joker: I dont think it can make now, can it Andy?|pg||
nt|andyv:  i don't think so|pg||
nt|andyv:  can't ruff 2@cs and still pick up the @d suit... and he still has a @s to lose|pg||
nt|andyv:  if either minor behaved this would be a quick claimer|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Had to win first trick and play three top clubs, methinks|pg||
nt|paulg:  Versace may block the clubs here to get a heart through|pg||
nt|Walddk2: However, I also admire some imagination when you know that your opponents are much better players|pg||
nt|petergill: At the other table, North opened 1@S, East passed (sensible and disciplined) and Madala as South has responded 1NT, which could lead to a @D partscore, I guess|pg||
nt|Gerben42: the maximum for an Italian 1@S is quite high, still not passing was a position|pg||
nt|petergill: Actually, Lauria did well not to play hearts too early, else North would have been able to beat him|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|andyv:  I think so|pg||

nt|robinswr: only a diamond lead beats 4hearts|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Where else would the defence get the tricks from with that dummy?|pg||
nt|idc: The 1NT response was game forcing, artificial|pg||
pc|c6|nt|capercliff: with just the A@s N doesnt have to bid 3N|pg||
nt|bagman: Sure but AQxx Kxxxx x Kxx gives some play, I think|pg||
nt|andyv:  the plus side is that both NS are original passers so they shouldn't get carried away by overbidding|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No offence intended of course|pg||
nt|andyv:  maybe... although dbl would seem indicated if that were the case|pg||
nt|petergill: East knows from Trick 1 that South has @DK and N has @DQ, so he knows all the high card layout|pg||
pc|c3|nt|iceblue: morning, its 17:20 here :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  now the bad news|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it is by no means trivial to wind up in 3N, making while 4S fails|pg||
nt|bagman: S is not going to like discarding but there's not much he can do wrong really|pg||
nt|petergill: NS lead 3rd/5th, so East knows @D's were 4-4  |pg||

pc|dJ|nt|jtr: Wonderful!|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Lauria-Versace are in 4@S on board 5|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Just making I think|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer may reason that North was bound to lead a club or a diamond. His choice of a club may indicate that he holds the diamond ace, which makes a lead in that suit less ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: attractive.|pg||
nt|lesniak: lepiej bylo z karta adama otw 1 trefl i stanac w 1-2 pik:(:(|pg||
nt|bagman: Here 2M might be considered overbidding|pg||
nt|iain sime: "three was too high partner"|pg||

nt|hedyg: so you all thought the 1@s opening bid was ok there?|pg||
nt|xenya: fireworks here|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is an example of Restricted Choice. If declarer had similar holdings in both the minors, he might have chosen to lead a diamond instead.|pg||
nt|bagman: especially if N is known to attack on opening lead|pg||
nt|lesniak: choc nie chcialbym uslyszec po 1 trefl np 1 ba lub 2 karo  od partnera|pg||
nt|lesniak: nie mowiac juz o 2 ba|pg||
nt|marlowepi: first u have to bid it, then they have to lead a nonclub|pg||
nt|brolucius: The bidding on the last deal was instructive. When you compete for a part-score, responder should be very wary of undoing your good work by going too high.|pg||
nt|hedyg: not really if he counted N's hcps|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 1-point upgrade|pg||
nt|barnets: count one point for good clubs|pg||
nt|petergill: Duboin and Sementa are among the very best card players in the world - the best, according to some people (especially from Italy). |pg||
nt|Gerben42: can imagine better breaks..|pg||
nt|barnets: actually breaks ok here|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: Duboin looking the hands over|pg||

nt|fabsayc: well successful, pretty skinny|pg||
nt|schtsch: 8 tricks are there in 3nt|pg||
nt|toral5: routine 4@S here|pg||
nt|Walddk5: 12-15|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Nice looking 4@S for EW. All the prequisites of going overboard.|pg||
nt|athene: 4@S here will be an interesting exercise for declarer|pg||
nt|athene: maybe you try to cash three diamonds and crossruff|pg||
nt|toral5: 3nt looked makeable to me.|pg||
nt|robinswr: i thought the italians believe that when i doubt bid 3nt even if you don't have stoppers in the opponents suit|pg||
nt|robinswr: flannery?|pg||

nt|Walddk2: A fine slam now|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: nice to be with you all|pg||
nt|haans: nice that you are :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: might have gone for 200 undoubled|pg||
nt|barnets: that proves troublesome|pg||
nt|ziff:  Another @C would not have worked, as N could have discarded a @S. Declarer would manage to establish a @S, but would not be able to enter his hand again to cash it|pg||
nt|athene: that won't work so well|pg||
mb|1H|nt|henryb:  I remind specs that I do not respond to queries from peope who do not have the courtesy to disclose their ful names on their peofile|pg||

nt|vasmar: 4@h be E easy|pg||
nt|andyv:  mini splinter?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I must say, NS don't seem to be intimidated at all... Not letting EW play they usually do, ask to see claims, etc.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: On board 3, Bocchi-Madala discovered the club weakness, but they are uncomfortably high in 5@H. It also got a spade lead|pg||
nt|mamos: i hadnt even thought about if it was making just expected to bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: pretty likely that S had Q@c|pg||
nt|brolucius: Double (competitive) can mean clubs and spade tolerance (usually a doubleton).|pg||
nt|Gerben42: with this @H stopper you need @C for 0 loser|pg||
nt|petergill: East hand is worth 20.05 HCP, according to Kand R Evaluator at http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=aq2+k64+k6+ak986|pg||
nt|mdgraham: mildly unlucky lead, that diamond |pg||
nt|rv: 3n superior to 4@h for NS though both contracts make|pg||
nt|drorp: Italians have been remarkebly aggressive so far|pg||
nt|april7: 2 or 3 @S by N??|pg||
nt|athene: 4@H+1 here i would guess|pg||

nt|bagman: Here 4@H for EW looks fine|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: 4@h failed on 4|pg||
nt|brolucius: Had Bocchi taken David's advice and cashed the second diamond winner, he would have made an overtrick.  |pg||
nt|jtr: I would usually defer to him:)|pg||
nt|brolucius: South scored a club overruff to defeat 4@H at the other table.|pg||
nt|tez: 2@d=good raise|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Adam Kaplan wrote a book on the "Tired RHO squeeze", applying here as well :)|pg||
nt|xenya: 5@D now -- can W or E bid 6 after that?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Madala would like to get doubled in a number of diamonds. Contemplating how to achieve that|pg||
nt|rodvenn: 6@dx = 3 down?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He has no defence against any contract by EW|pg||
nt|rodvenn: Hofta will go on to 6 and Madala will save i think. Not poosible to get minus 4 in practise|pg||
nt|sharkey: slam time|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@d=4+|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@H= negative freebid|pg||
nt|brolucius: Why not raise to 4@H?|pg||
nt|athene: EW do play a slightly strange form of Polish club|pg||
nt|andyv:  just needed 2-2 @ds and @hs to behave...not too much to ask|pg||
nt|rv: 2@c seems precision style|pg||
nt|drorp: yep, and they will|pg||
nt|athene: EW will surely take the money rather than risk 5@H|pg||
nt|april7: 4@S only 3 down|pg||
nt|drorp: 4@S from south surely, then versace will have to bid 5@H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The key is of course the singleton club opposite nothing|pg||
nt|tokay1975: even if  dummy has 5small spades  6h has a chance to make without heart lead so they will get there easily|pg||
nt|jillan:  and it promises a singelton|pg||

nt|Walddk4: 2NT game-forcing with support I assume|pg||
nt|brolucius: Obvious to attack when dummy is known to hold a five-card side suit.|pg||

mb|p|nt|Walddk4: 3NT balanced minimum|pg||
nt|brgpro: hi|pg||
nt|capercliff: yes 1@s was pretty normal? 4@s is maybe a better contract|pg||
nt|paulg:  1@s is very usual for them|pg||
nt|sharkey: sry - missing 2 aces|pg||
nt|lesniak: to pogarsza sytuacje|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: lepsze tu jest ustalenie kolor+fit - 4@C|pg||
nt|antoniz: chyba nie w tej sekwencji|pg||
nt|lesniak: bo mam nadzieje ze Cezary moze powiedziec 3 kier forsujace|pg||
nt|andyv:  spec says 8-11 any singleton, 3@h asks and 3N shows @d singleton|pg||
nt|hedyg: Bas says Bocchi was told 2@H is strong so maybe it isnt a NFB|pg||
nt|iain sime: This has allowed South another chance.|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@S = minors |pg||
nt|barnets: but in fact they led a spade v 3N in other room from south dont ask me why|pg||
nt|schtsch: low heart lead in closed|pg||
nt|latwy: tymczasem nasze panie grubo przegrywaj¹ z ostatni¹ dru¿yn¹|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@C should do the trick|pg||
nt|jillan:  West has promised a single with 2NT, East can now find out which one it is|pg||
nt|viren169: but it wont stop N/S bidding the game|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I just saw a 1st in hand opening much worse than that :)|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|hedyg: 2@d=@H|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2@S is what Kelsey used to describe as daisy-picking.|pg||
nt|athene: they play 4-card heart opener so the weak NT option in 1@C denies 4 hearts|pg||
nt|gulyas: sry, 15-17 with @Cs|pg||
nt|gulyas: an easy game here - some might try 6@C and succeed, but its not easy to bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: or 11+ 3suiter singleton @d|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: 2@D 2-way xyz?|pg||
nt|bagman: Italians are known to bid slams without 2 aces but I think that this generation uses RKCB as routine|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2way checkback, yes|pg||
nt|brolucius: The old 2-ace-missing system was so that opponents did at least have a chance of beating them.|pg||
nt|hedyg: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/May/OpenTeams/italy/duboin-sementa.pdf|pg||
nt|bagman: And indeed in Stockholm they did|pg||
nt|bagman: West is going to make a try|pg||
nt|Walddk2: As we see, 4@S can be defeated on best defence|pg||
nt|hedyg: over 2@d they bid up the line, i.e. with 4@Hs he would show those first|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Heart lead ruffed, diamond to the ace, heart ruff, and @SA|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, a heart is a plausible lead. It would stand out if West had actually bid hearts, since East has shown a balanced hand.|pg||
nt|sharkey: Even with a @C back goes down|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes S gets a 2nd chance to find the right return|pg||
nt|bagman: No, but N gets the ruff|pg||
nt|brolucius: If North is leading a heart, expecting it to be ruffed, he should lead a suit-preference card.|pg||
nt|bagman: On club return W probably tries to ditch the diamond|pg||
nt|hedyg: but N has no indication of 4 cards in @H in W|pg||
nt|brolucius: Learned kibitzers claim that it is OBVIOUS to play in no-trumps.|pg||
nt|sharkey: rite - so far W has only shown @S so not obvious to lead @H for ruff|pg||
nt|marlowepi: another cheesy takeout double, though at the colours fairly normal|pg||
nt|sybarra: remember these are seniors not juniors  |pg||
nt|hedyg: 10@s for free|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: This is possibly the longest I ever saw Duboin take to lead lol|pg||
nt|hedyg: he knows he is leading into a double stopper|pg||
nt|mdgraham: might reach 6@C here|pg||
nt|drorp: Versace doubling at first, to show a better hand than 4@H directly, but this plan backfires|pg||
nt|april7: possible EW going overboard because both think  p has singleton @S|pg||
nt|athene: 4nt unusual, offering choice of minors|pg||
nt|toral5: @D guess 4 an ot|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Well, the right combination of 14 counts will produce a slam|pg||
nt|toral5: thts true.both dont think they ll even explore on a semi wk 1nt aftr a texas auction|pg||

nt|april7: X of 3 @S is not very helpful|pg||
nt|athene: quite aggressive with exactly the wrong number of spades|pg||
nt|barnets: dec can make 6@S by setting up hearts and dropping the @SQ not too likely|pg||

mb|p|nt|brgpro: 2NT=GF bal. |pg||

nt|brolucius: 4@H would have bought it. Another instructive bidding hand.|pg||
nt|barnets: and so THEN the breaks are good and he will make it|pg||
nt|andyv:  with all the intermediates, do you think W has an invite with her 8 count, Barbara?|pg||
nt|babs59: I wouldn't|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: 3-3 diamonds and the double club stop mean this won't take too long|pg||
nt|sybarra: do they play this as a puppet sequence.  looks like it |pg||
nt|bjacobs: Looks like it, in an unusual setting|pg||
nt|mdgraham: actually there was no guess in 6@D - two unavoidable losers at least |pg||

nt|sharkey: yes|pg||
nt|pasker: I think W may have been able to put Madala to a trump guess on that deal as @C weakness was marked|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Madala took all 13 by dropping @HQ, 11 IMPs to Italy|pg||
nt|bagman: EW like to sniff every possible slam. Sometimes that might give too much info for the defense|pg||

nt|schtsch: w showing shape|pg||
nt|schtsch: or?|pg||
nt|corplaw: S may have some difficulty pitching on run of diamonds|pg||
nt|drorp: they're still OK, somehow|pg||
nt|robinswr: i doubt is|pg||
nt|robinswr: it|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Tough lead|pg||
nt|toral5: now making i guess|pg||
nt|yuval10: need small @h lead otherwise @h's are blocked|pg||
nt|haans: 3nt no chance|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 3@H showed @S or ... I couldn't hear the ... though|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Sorry|pg||
nt|yuval10: @s's or no @s's|pg||
nt|yuval10: 3@s from W was 4 cards @s|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: That is the question!|pg||
nt|yuval10: lol 3@h can be either way|pg||
nt|haans: W has 2 hearts|pg||
nt|haans: nice make|pg||
nt|toral5: wd ve loved the auction 1@H-pp-dbl:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: If you're talking about Txx KQxxx KQxx x, I don't think that was that bad a hand|pg||
pc|h3|nt|brgpro: he didnt show his @s at all|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: Cashout for an OT here? @SJxx is fortunate :)|pg||
nt|jtr: Communications a little awkward here|pg||
nt|jtr: But clearing the @ss seems right as you say|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Yesterday there was a similar auction where several Italian kibs claimed they don't play Puppet over 2@D openings|pg||
nt|lesniak: w trej chwili dojscie do wielikana graniczy z cudem|pg||
nt|antoniz: lol|pg||
nt|schtsch: ouch|pg||
nt|athene: i am surprised versace didn't just bid 4@H over 3@S|pg||
nt|jillan:  promises 1 or 4 aces|pg||
nt|peachy: where I play, 3H means "4-card spades, no 4-card hearts", but Barel-Zack have different agreements|pg||
pc|h8|nt|hedyg: i think it showed 4@s|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This one is not too trivial to play at all|pg||
nt|hedyg: i dont know...a hand that has NOTHING outside the @ss.....|pg||
nt|capercliff: what else Hedy? pass?|pg||
nt|hedyg: that doesnt go as a 1@s opening bid in 1st seat vuln for me|pg||
nt|hedyg: too strong for a weak 2?|pg||
nt|capercliff: yes|pg||
nt|hedyg: you need a lot to make game, if pd cannot bid over a weak 2 i am not going anywhere|pg||
nt|capercliff: duck 2 @c and down 3|pg||
nt|hedyg: Bocchi found the @H lead in OR|pg||
nt|hedyg: he can make this|pg||
nt|iain sime: Should survive.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5@H also makes|pg||
nt|hedyg: must get @hs right|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, very fortunate.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Impossible to go wrong, really|pg||
nt|stc: very good decision by Mossop|pg||
nt|athene: now he knows the spade suit is dead|pg||
nt|athene: but there aren't really any fresh woods and pastures new that look particularly promising|pg||
nt|jkotor: :)|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@C - 1@D - 1@h would have been forcing, so 2@H is very strong and natural|pg||
nt|haans: maybe 3@D as trf to 3nt|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||

nt|koksoy: they  will  play  4@H|pg||
nt|rv: maybe South's 3@c showed @s with possibly max hand|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Bocchi obviously not expecting too much for the 1@H overcall|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: no it was another match on my way here|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Ah|pg||
nt|viren169: That would not have been nice!|pg||
nt|viren169: probably hold declarer to 3 tricks for +1100|pg||
pc|dK|nt|hedyg: 4 or 5|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's a miracle that a diamond stands up after the support, and yet they can't beat it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So there is something wrong with Madala's judgement in my opinion|pg||
nt|hedyg: and also got the @c ruff|pg||
nt|Walddk2: David's point is valid. *IF* North thinks he can give partner5 a heart ruff on lead, he should also leader a high card in order to show preference for the higher suit, diamonds|pg||
nt|brolucius: South has shown big black two-suiter, so cannot hold all three hearts.|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: czy B-N graj¹ w tej chwili w Tunezji?|pg||

nt|jillan:  I said MOST of his spades  :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: well done|pg||
nt|jillan:  they should lead atrump wityh this auction I think|pg||
nt|jillan:  same contract in the other room|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: No lead...|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: And Bocchi and Berthea took the dummy and they just accepted =|pg||
nt|peachy: no, 3D shows 1 or both 4-card majors, no 5 card major|pg||
pc|d4|nt|brolucius: Hi to the kibitzers!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Oh I see|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good morning David|pg||
nt|iceblue: 2NT is nat fg, It is very puplar in china|pg||
nt|brolucius: Win with the @HA, clear the spades (if there is a loser) and the defenders would then have to play a club to give you any entry problem.|pg||
nt|lesniak: w polsce nie stosuje sie odpowiedzi na Blackwooda pokazujace renons- szkoda|pg||
nt|bagman: 4@H makes now easily but generally this kind of contract can be quite delicate because of the misfit. It cannot stand bad breaks|pg||
nt|petergill: 6@C is a good contract, but both finesses fail|pg||
nt|rv: possibly 4@s is kickback asking for key cards in @hs and South's 5@c shows 1 key|pg||
nt|tokay1975: yes clubs split nicely|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ryskiel_: a jak podobala by siê sekwencja 2@C-3@C-3@D-3@H itd?|pg||
nt|mamos: looking at all four hands  this looks straightforward enough|pg||
nt|toral5: 1 imp at stake here aftr the open room result:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: This is the second time since I've started operating that there was a claim for = without a lead. Both of the times were during this tournament|pg||
nt|haans: sry did mean 3@H as trf|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: sorry 2@H -  3@C  mialo byæ|pg||
nt|babs59: there's no real source of tricks - make the clubs QJ10xx and yes I would |pg||
nt|petergill: 3@C showed 3+ card support|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: N has shown @H+@D|pg||
nt|cumino: I Think a misundarstanding. 2@c >>2NT should be 55 or @S@D or @H@D|pg||
nt|rv: I am completely lost now and will stop guessing|pg||
nt|haans: but leave it|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|mdgraham: according to the CC, 3@c is Stayman|pg||
nt|hedyg: by Zivkovic|pg||
nt|bagman: The lead hurts more declarer's nerves than the contract|pg||
nt|athene: but italian style is always double to show a good hand, almost irrespective of distribution|pg||
nt|peachy: N should have overtaken, did he not overtale Bas?|pg||
nt|peachy: overtake|pg||
nt|haans: @H8 made 3nt easy make|pg||
nt|peachy: hmm, either way, this now makes|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I didn't see him overtake, of course I might've missed something|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: We won't know till either plays a card :)|pg||
nt|peachy: small heart lead would have been best, but I cant really blame the Q, having QJ9xxx|pg||
pc|d5|nt|capercliff: he should have taken time on this one however, it was much better to play on @c's before playing a @s|pg||
nt|capercliff: he may even had made it|pg||
nt|henryb:  still one down, as he cannot untangle tricks|pg||
nt|capercliff: only 1 Henry?|pg||
nt|henryb:  Isner and Mahut now at 61-60|pg||
nt|paulg:  yes, who worries about (the number of) undertricks when non-vul |pg||
nt|hedyg: wow|pg||
nt|hedyg: they will play for ever!|pg||
nt|paulg:  more importantly, for some, Italy are still 0-1|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  no, I meant that even playing clubs first declarer would be down one|pg||
nt|capercliff: I was chatting with Roland last night, he was saying he might walk down to watch. This was at 56-56, thought he may get anothre hour of it:)|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer has quite safe 10 tricks by drawing trumps and giving away 2 clubs and a diamond|pg||
nt|Gerben42: @D ruff for 800|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: lol|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Nystrom showed his hand without a lead|pg||
nt|jkotor: 3@d = krótkoæ 8-10zz    zz: a=3, k=2, d=1|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Nope :)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|xenya: here, at any rate, it has proved to be wrong |pg||
nt|bagman: Now N is interested to know if 3@H shows suit or just strength|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Otherwise South will not know if he should lead a club or a diamond|pg||
nt|marlowepi: best lead for NS. looks like a snoring hand, but the double increasing likelihood of bad breaks in key suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nothing you could have done if he had|pg||
nt|petergill: Normal contract at both tables, well bid, unlucky , assuming no @h lead|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@d/@H=transfers|pg||
nt|bjacobs: A simple approach is to just hope @HQ drops doubleton|pg||
nt|hedyg: hmm|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The point is moot now, so much for science|pg||
nt|hedyg: here N had the info and did not find the @H lead|pg||
nt|sharkey: Not their day - that was yesterday......|pg||
nt|athene: if north had a huge heart or diamond suit he might have bid it instead of 2@S perhaps|pg||
nt|snetram:  okazuje siÄ Å¼e sztucznie teÅ¼ moÅ¼na|pg||
nt|jkotor: mam dobre wpomaganie od Szwedów na priv|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: The lead wasn't really @SQ, there was no lead|pg||
nt|petergill: There is a silly double dummy line to make, which will not happen|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Possibly a misunderstanding of the meaning of 4@D|pg||
nt|rv: 5@h/5n are last making contracts|pg||
nt|cumino: Yes 4@D nat for Manara|pg||
nt|rv: you need lots of practise playing complicated relay based systems, otherwise you tend to lose more than you gain by such disasters|pg||
nt|viren169: East may have responded 1@S to make matters worse!|pg||
nt|haans: on @D dcl sort of sqz|pg||
pc|c2|nt|sybarra: but with the 3 @S bid,  looks like puppet |pg||
nt|Walddk2: What do you think, do the players from the "lesser" nations enjoy playing against Italy or do they fear it, especially when they are on vugraph?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if I read it right|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Both|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I think both as well|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I saw a Serbian player take the match card with the countries and player names yesterday :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: there is a lot of pressure when you are on Vugraph |pg||
nt|mbruun: Possible push for Lithuania. Ceasefire|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Enormous pressure.  They would surely MUCH prefer to play the Italians in a small private room with no one watching|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: My first and only match on BBO was a disaster, it was against Belgium :(|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I would guess that they would be up for it. Lithuanians are a fiercely proud people |pg||
nt|bjacobs: This is a really complex position|pg||
nt|bjacobs: One possibility for Duboin is to ruff a club, then plan to discard a spade on the 4th club, then ruff a spade - finally the heart finesse|pg||
nt|bagman: he can discard one of the diamonds on the @SQ|pg||
nt|andyv:  E could see 10 tricks if @hs broke|pg||
nt|andyv:  now he has to decide how to tackle the @d and @c suits|pg||
nt|bagman: If trumps were 4-0, declarer needs some luck elsewhere|pg||
nt|bagman: He's safe to draw the last trump and establis a trick in clubs |pg||
nt|koksoy: he  may  try  ruffing 2  clubs|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer is afraid of having one of the diamond winners ruffed.|pg||
nt|athene: south is presumably wondering whether his partner has the @DK|pg||
pc|c8|nt|bagman: Now declarer goes up and starts trumps|pg||
nt|bagman: no need to guess|pg||
nt|petergill: Usually it's better to set up the side suit first, on hands like this one in 5@HX|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good afternoon to Paul Gipson|pg||
nt|corplaw: another pickup for croatia on club guess|pg||
pc|cK|nt|andyv:  when things go bad....|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|hedyg: Bocchi had no info|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, that too.|pg||
nt|andyv:  vul vs. none, you need about 42-44% chance of making game to bid it in mp.|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I am sorry, I lost the play here|pg||
nt|ziff:  Yes. Ruff two @Ds, cash 2 @S, throw in South with the last @C|pg||
nt|athene: now declarer, having stolen a diamond, will crossruff, i guess|pg||
nt|toral5: @C are nicely placed for lauria|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|athene: yes, the multi allowed EW to say their piece at a lower level and then give up |pg||
nt|paulg:  Hi everyone|pg||
nt|robinswr: only reason it makes|pg||
nt|toral5: so as expected italy gained 7 on brd 2 stopping wel in a @S partial|pg||
nt|ppiglett: No need for club. with Diamond A onside - now cold - missed opportunity for Holland|pg||
nt|toral5: will versace bid 5@H at this vul with 1/2 @S losers?|pg||
nt|ppiglett: excuse me - Netherlands|pg||
nt|robinswr: needs one more trick |pg||
nt|toral5: i think @S ace wd not ve gained|pg||
nt|robinswr: he has 7 tricks and needs either the q of spades dropping or the QJ of clubs dropping|pg||
nt|toral5: this can turn out to be a huge brd for italy if 4s is allowed to play in the other room|pg||
pc|dA|nt|bjacobs: Or even discard two spades on two clubs?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: An interesting expansion of the basic plan|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If it's true what you are saying, the Italians have an advantage when they buy a vugraph box for the entire tournament. Everyone is forced to play against them on vugraph|pg||
nt|mbruun: They have many advantages, the Vu-graph, their system, their cardplay. |pg||
nt|bjacobs: This play is fraught as well - if South is 3-3-4-3, he will eventually be able to overruff dummy|pg||
nt|mamos: yes setting up Clubs may be harder |pg||
nt|frululu: by ouch y mean a good score in american football ? |pg||
nt|schtsch: don't need it|pg||
nt|corplaw: or spade trick :)|pg||
nt|robinswr: does south have AQ2 of spades?|pg||
nt|robinswr: or AQ|pg||
nt|robinswr: unlikely to be a singleton|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Good play from Simon - put Lauria to a guess in a free position|pg||
nt|toral5: lauria needs @D ace right 2 make this|pg||
nt|robinswr: would he lead from the queen in this situation|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Would de Wijs have bid 4@S on T987xxx?|pg||
nt|robinswr: 7-card suits are worth bidding|pg||
nt|mdgraham: get the clubs right, and 5@Hx is 500 I think|pg||
nt|toral5: if west doesnt cash out,@H ace ll b discarded|pg||
pc|c5|nt|koksoy: that  is  @C A  and ruff  @H Q  THEN|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Another win for 4th best from your longest and strongest|pg||
pc|h2|nt|hedyg: hmmm he might try to disc the @d now?|pg||
nt|petergill: East is endplayed after he ruffs the @D and has to accept 800 instead of 1100  - he will try a low club from his king |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not easy to play that trump suit for 1 loser|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: after 46 in big swings this will be a welcome score for the Swiss ladies|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|tez: @d2 is suit pereferance|pg||
nt|bjacobs: She!  |pg||
nt|petergill: At the other table, Norberto Bocchi did not bid as boldly as Janis Ozols|pg||
nt|barnets: nice play|pg||
nt|barnets: gives north a dilemma|pg||
nt|petergill: Duboin, anticipating the endplay, works out that it's better to play a club from his side than to give partner the @d ruff. Classy, as long as it doesn't backfire.|pg||
nt|ziff:  Probably doesn t work, even, as everything is blocked afterwards|pg||
nt|cumino: Normally on 2@C the relay is 2@D, 2NT is for two switers FG, no support in @C|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|Walddk2: An additional advantage then, as if they need more|pg||
nt|Gerben42: thats impressive bridging|pg||
pc|h4|nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|henryb:  He won't get within 100 yards of it unless he went at about 9AM|pg||
nt|hedyg: now @d finesse would have been netter|pg||
nt|hedyg: better even|pg||
nt|tokay1975: now clm|pg||
pc|dT|pg||
nt|rv: even 6n had a chance with non @h lead and right view in @s with lucky fall of @DJ in 3 rounds|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Last hope is a revoke|pg||
pc|d7|nt|atabey: that italian imp could be fake :) I cant see a way for sementa to take 11 tricks on board 4|pg||
nt|andyv:  undertricks are going to be expensive|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: show of hands: who would have doubled with Madala's cards?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The smaller federations can't afford that |pg||
nt|koksoy: HÝ  Paul|pg||
nt|robinswr: now just needs ace of diamond on sides|pg||
nt|ppiglett: But simon knows that the clubs are coming down and the Ace of diamond is onside - he has to try something to put declarer off the right line|pg||
nt|toral5: but cash out is very clear here|pg||
nt|haans: yep a make but the overtricks?|pg||
pc|c6|nt|fabsayc: next|pg||
nt|april7: an immediate 5 @H would have asked E about second round control in @S|pg||
nt|athene: north wants to throw both his hearts on this trick :)|pg||
nt|toral5: betr wd ve been NOT discarding a @S frm hand|pg||
pc|h6|nt|mbruun: See your point|pg||
nt|hedyg: not Duboin, no greed!|pg||
nt|athene: so he can ruff high and play a trump|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|petergill: I think it was better to pitch a @D there, not a spade|pg||
pc|d6|nt|bjacobs: So I think the whole hand gets down to the first point - you are going to need @HQ to drop doubleton|pg||
nt|mbruun: Two clublosers as expected|pg||
pc|h7|nt|andyv:  I wouldn't|pg||
nt|capercliff: well he does only live about 2 miles from the site now!|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|andyv:  sometimes the opps have their bids|pg||
nt|bagman: declarer hoping that if ruffed that would be from long trumps|pg||
nt|petergill: Format is - after 19 rounds, the top 9 in each Group survive, and carry forward 100% of their score against each of the 8 other qualifiers in their Group. They then play the nine ...|pg||
nt|petergill: qualifiers form the other Group to determine the winning team. The top 6 teams qualify for next year's Bermuda Bowl (WC) in Netherlands. |pg||
nt|athene: but sadly you are only allowed to discard one card at a time|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|athene: lauria can afford the spade finesse now|pg||
nt|hedyg: and no risks|pg||
nt|brolucius: There was all the more reason for North to lead a heart, looking for a ruff, because the Italian auction had been confident - including some cue bids.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|Gerben42: he knows where @SA is so will duck|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://tinyurl.com/ebc-open-b   http://tinyurl.com/ebc-open-a   http://tinyurl.com/3yl8spu    http://tinyurl.com/39bvxwu  for running Euro scores. Please bookmark the sites|pg||
nt|bagman: Only worry now is 4-1 trumps|pg||
pc|sA|nt|hedyg: that is the result announced by the players|pg||
nt|petergill: No, all Ok, will be 800|pg||
nt|bagman: Soon declarer plays a heart|pg||
nt|ziff:  Entries are not a problem. @DA, @SQ, but later @Ss and @Hs are blocked|pg||
nt|athene: i suppose that is the opposite of a squeeze|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|s2|pg||
nt|athene: opposite of squeeze = stretch - "north was stretched in hearts"|pg||
nt|barnets: Italys march continues 42-0|pg||
nt|barnets: if it was boxing they would stop it.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why do you think I changed my flag? :)|pg||
pc|c7|nt|koksoy: get  the  hearts then  play for the squeze  for an overtrick ( if  someone has 5 clubs & @SK)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Just kidding, I did it a month ago|pg||
pc|cA|nt|tez: right yalcin..it was 10 trick|pg||
nt|bagman: As Lauria had safe 10 tricks he did not risk the contract by trying for an overtrick by leaving a lurker trump at large|pg||
nt|andyv:  was it really safe?|pg||
nt|andyv:  could S have had a high @D?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Panayiotou called the TD because Lauria claimed to fast and didn't show his cards, he feels|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: too fast even|pg||
nt|bagman: IMO, yes 3 spades, 1 club 1 ruff ad 5 trumps|pg||
nt|bagman: Lauria can ruff a diamond and discard one on the @SQ|pg||
nt|bagman: then give away AQ of clubs|pg||
pc|c9|nt|cicus: hi all|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can't quite fiddle an overtrick despite having winners in all the side suits|pg||
pc|sK|nt|rv: revoke before East wins @HK, else as per bridge laws it is 1 down:)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In my heart I will remain Danish, just like Barnet is Scottish now and forever I'm sure|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s6|nt|barnets: right|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|athene: no way the defence can cash three clubs even if the lead was something weird|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mbruun: Well done|pg||
nt|koksoy: he  hears  me  :)|pg||

nt|kiwi_joker: Kibs are adamant they would've ..perhaps benefit of hindsight tho  :-)|pg||
nt|andyv:  you win 10 imps by passing|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I'm not seeing a reason, an Ace and maybe 2 @H tricks?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 6.4 IMPs/board, not a bad average|pg||
nt|bagman: W could have afforded to play clubs and lose @SA, ruff and @DA|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: Madala is originally from Argentina, I believe|pg||
nt|stc: and like Germany|pg||
nt|cumino: 3NT only by North|pg||
nt|rv: y presume 1n by North now|pg||
nt|athene: short club with transfer responses, so 1@S from north|pg||
nt|jillan:  they are playing it at the other table.....|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Yes, Nystrom went to the bathroom and Bertheau picked up his cards and showed them to Bocchi who shrugged|pg||
nt|mdgraham: however, who needs that sort of guess - and yet the oppo might go 5@s which you have a chance of defeating|pg||
nt|toral5: now i m tired of typing FLAT GAMES:):(|pg||
mb|3H|nt|athene: now we see if NS play the style that lets them stop in 3major after 2nt opener|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I was kidding btw :)|pg||
mb|d|nt|brgpro: i dont know their style, but lauria-versace will bid 2@d, showing 6+@h|pg||
nt|jtr: X shows 4+@hs suually as an extension of transfer responses|pg||
nt|andyv:  if you dbl and take the same tricks, it's 14 imps... but, if you warn declarer of the suit break and it goes down only 1 (8 imps) or makes 14 imps against you... not a good return for your dbl|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: quite right|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: EW making 8 tricks in 5@C?|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: NS *can* pick up 800 off this|pg||
nt|andyv:  it appears so|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: ..but south's is a hand that lookes right to declare, not defend|pg||

nt|bagman: North had the guts to bid the preemptive 3@H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That too|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am not in favour of people changing nationality. The European 100 metre record is now held by a Nigerian (changed to Portuguese). The same when Danish people become Londoners...|pg||
nt|gulyas: szia Gabor|pg||

nt|andyv:  S certainly bought a great dummy|pg||
nt|Walddk8: Those Lavazza girls again|pg||
nt|rv: South may bid 3@d here or jump to 3n not to give room for West to indicate lead?|pg||
nt|athene: many pairs these days don't|pg||
nt|athene: 1@S is 0-6 hcp any shape, or a normal response in diamonds|pg||
nt|othered1: this will be a yawner, too, but EW must cash their @Hon opening lead, or lose them.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: set yourself up a macro, Sapan|pg||

nt|brolucius: changed position of the defenders' cards so that the winning play would be necessary). |pg||
nt|andyv:  N should respect the dbl|pg||
nt|paulg:  I see that Sementa disagrees with you too Hedy, on what to open @sAKQxxx ... of course they all went minus|pg||
nt|capercliff: the defence was not as sharp in the other room on brd 4, it was allowed to make|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Lauria bid 5@S, Versace 6@C and Broge in the tank now|pg||
nt|hedyg: it is surely overwhelming for the Slovakia team to be playing vs Italy AND on VG|pg||
nt|pasker: but holds a very suit oreintated hand |pg||
nt|hedyg: Madala is Italian now|pg||
nt|Walddk2: :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol David|pg||
nt|athene: lauria-versace's auction looks strange|pg||
nt|gulyas: I expect them to bid this for a push|pg||
nt|cicus: I might have considered 1@S overcall as West|pg||
nt|athene: if 3@C is a game try, why didn't east respect the 3@H sign-off?|pg||
nt|koksoy: now  2 |pg||
nt|bagman: Sementa is neither happy to pass nor happy to bid|pg||
nt|babs59: the East hand certainly had the fillers for West's hand, together with South's @CAK|pg||
nt|lechcold: 2@C w PO bez w¹tpienia mo¿na by³o wygraæ|pg||
nt|lechcold: 1BA 5-4|pg||
nt|athene: a trump lead will beat 3@S by two? declarer can't ruff a diamond or get the hearts going in time|pg||
nt|toral5: very lucky 4@H here|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Update: France is making short work of the Turkish ladies, with Sweden scoring 25 as well vs Czech Republic. Netherlands are currently stuck at 21 against Switzerland.|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: 7@h/7@s ok but how?|pg||
nt|daman: this should fail on a @C lead|pg||
nt|brolucius: A welcome flat board for Slovakia.|pg||
nt|Gerben42: Ozols thinking another 1-level contract for me|pg||
nt|petergill: A good start by Latvia. Against the big guns, they beat Germany 16-14 (a great result), lost 13-17 to Bulgaria and lost 12-18 to Iceland, so they are doing quite well against the ...|pg||
nt|petergill: "heavies"|pg||
nt|petergill: so Latvia have already played many of the top teams and are doing well to be in the top half of the field|pg||
nt|athene: maybe 3@C is just probing for the best game, keeping 3nt in the picture|pg||
nt|jillan:  making Luria work for his moeny :)|pg||
mb|4S|nt|brgpro: well, i would think X shows 5+@h...other wise we cant explain the 2@h bid from S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: looks suspiciously natural, that 2NT|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Currently conversion to IMPs would mean a 25-1 victory to Italy|pg||
nt|sybarra: protecting the aqxx of @H and the K's |pg||
nt|mdgraham: England could have done with that against Slovenia in the footy yesterday|pg||
nt|snetram:  Poziom czwarty sÅuzy do ustalenia czy partner posiada renons pik|pg||

nt|Walddk8: Concentrate Bas!|pg||
nt|schtsch: don't think oggy will have anything against 2@h contract|pg||
nt|rv: Double by North should show max hand, can't be penalty/trump stack since she already denied 4@hs by 1n bid|pg||
nt|drorp: N transfers and signs off, 3@S is alot worse than 2NT but he can't know that|pg||
nt|toral5: interesting dbl here|pg||
nt|toral5: 3@D=bergen or some other form of @S raise?|pg||
nt|othered1: so 3@H was just having north define his hand, I guess.|pg||
nt|toral5: may be limit or betr in @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: You can look back at it later. Declarer led towards his club honor, hoping to find the ace on his right.|pg||
nt|paulg:  with only one entry to his hand, pass looks an easy call|pg||
nt|athene: can versace get anything other than his five obvious tricks? those spade spots are very small|pg||
nt|athene: i suppose he can just force with the fourth club|pg||
nt|athene: that should do the trick|pg||
nt|drorp: can short declearer with his 4th club, eventually|pg||
nt|drorp: 2 down is my bet|pg||
nt|athene: yes|pg||
nt|april7: down 1 if @S honours don't crash|pg||
nt|athene: notice how south suffers the usual problem of a weak-no-trumper when he picks up a strong notrump|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Many many years ago, they played the hand when declarer and one defender were in the bathroom|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: Right Bas entered it|pg||

nt|brgpro: but, with 4333, shd he always bid 2@h?|pg||
nt|hedyg: obviously cuebid|pg||
nt|henryb:  tough to find @d after this start|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Well judged, big swing to Norway|pg||
nt|rodvenn: well bid. can he find the spade q?|pg||

nt|brolucius: Also the German football team has three Poles and a Brazilian... (I make my excuses in advance) |pg||
nt|athene: i am told 2@D in the other room was not a heart raise|pg||

nt|schtsch: tesla took out his butcher hatchet|pg||
nt|corplaw: 2S looks like it makes|pg||
nt|schtsch: but is there a meat to cut?|pg||
nt|ahri: in croatia it's well known as "buzdowan", could be translated to english as "flail" double|pg||

nt|wstuart: lol|pg||
nt|ahri: :D|pg||
nt|schtsch: i guess w is thinking|pg||
nt|schtsch: is he?|pg||
nt|wstuart: well, it was pointed out that Croatia needed a minor miracle to qual, so they are doing what they need to do to create swings|pg||
nt|schtsch: well, madala could bid 2nt|pg||
nt|schtsch: as pick your poison|pg||
nt|wstuart: I don't see how he can move from 2@S here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it's a bit of a point. In those kinds of position, do you mind conceding 800 against a vul game if every so often you get a chance of going plus if the oppo misguess|pg||
nt|haans: even with @CA lead boring hand|pg||
nt|viren169: With the diamonds 3-3 and K of spades right there are 10 tricks available for Declarer|pg||
pc|hA|nt|brolucius: If it had been, the defender would have to surrender the contract, whether he rose with the ace or not.|pg||
nt|othered1: on @D lead @H is 5 or 7|pg||

nt|bagman: This is  too much for Versace to handle|pg||
nt|vasmar: 4 losers|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Simpson claiming he has a minimum|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N hoping S has something like Axx of spades and short clubs|pg||
nt|marlowepi: agree he has a minimum 3S bid:)|pg||
nt|stc: anyway, in bridge you don't even need a to be citizen to represent a country...|pg||
nt|rnmalik: P has passed 1@H, imo defend NT.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: "Is there a squeeze for the overtrick", the Danish declarer asked|pg||
nt|Walddk2: "Yes", replied the Finn|pg||
nt|jillan:  hahaha, played the hand? acutally as in PLAYED?|pg||
nt|idc: The NS CC is ... not as clear as it might be|pg||
nt|yuval10: after 8 boards only|pg||
pc|h5|nt|bagman: MIght not be flat|pg||
nt|bagman: a heart now and declarer might settle for his 9 tops|pg||
nt|brolucius: If Slovakia finish in the bottom half of the table, Italy's (magnificent) score from this match will count for nothing. You only carry over your scores against qualifying teams.|pg||
nt|sharkey: this reminds me of when we got a WO in a Pairs tournament after 5 rounds - finally achieving a Plus round|pg||
nt|bagman: or S might duck the @HJ and get 10 tricks by setting up the clubs|pg||
nt|hedyg: they are 14th so far|pg||
nt|brolucius: Respectable with such a small population.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Anyway, if you are going to have a string of awful boards, best to group them together in just one match.|pg||
nt|mamos: North has been conservative too|pg||
nt|barnets: e/w can make  3@C here|pg||
nt|ziff:  Various kibitzers have improved on my line by drawing only two trump before playing the 3rd @S. This seems to work, but nobody plays that way without mirrors in the room|pg||
nt|schtsch: and bocchi will pass it if it happens|pg||
nt|rv: well bid by Italian ladies here, all the more creditable after disaster in last deal|pg||
nt|tokay1975: nice pass  to 2sp  by dewijs|pg||
nt|jillan:  sooo funny, |pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Do we know this Dane?|pg||

nt|henryb:  need to lead a club|pg||
nt|capercliff: is that what the double was for?|pg||
nt|pasker: S had to be careful to hold up the C!A|pg||
nt|bagman: If south can refrain from playing a red card, this goes down|pg||
nt|bagman: There's only 2 discards on the clubs; declarer has a diamond loser letf|pg||
nt|pasker: oh yes sorry|pg||
nt|hedyg: Versace could have bid 3NT|pg||

nt|Walddk2: No service|pg||
nt|schtsch: revoke?|pg||
nt|athene: 3@S was alerted - did it show specifically two spades?|pg||
nt|drorp: on optimal defence they can take 4 spades and 2 clubs|pg||

nt|bagman: Duck and 1 IMP to Italy|pg||
nt|bagman: Take and then either flat or 2 IMPs to Italy|pg||
nt|bagman: Do Italians play Smith?|pg||

nt|jillan:  but maybe I have forgotten it.... running Alzheimer you know :)|pg||
nt|jillan:  I do believe you. Could easily have happened in the Nordic|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The other two players were a bit surprised when they came back and put the cards back in the wallet|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|brgpro: well, he has 4@s as well,....so, opps can't have a cheap contract here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Spain-Belgium must be playing football instead of bridge. The score is 1-0 after 5 boards|pg||
nt|rv: I might have led @HA from East hand hoping for stiff honor|pg||
nt|drorp: now @C, A@S, and 4th @C|pg||
nt|drorp: not hard|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Yuval Yener|pg||
nt|peachy: NS did it as NS|pg||
nt|peachy: in the other room,|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|brolucius: North would rarely lead the @HA from a combination such as A-Q-x, but here the bidding had suggested that neither East nor West held a heart control.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No, just a permanent resident for some time|pg||
nt|cicus: I expected E to try some club ruffs|pg||
nt|hedyg: once pd showed the rounded suits..|pg||

nt|atabey: would be a good auction if K of @h was offside with a @d lead|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|brgpro: normal|pg||

nt|sybarra: wonderful system |pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: OK, someting is terribly wrong here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but even with 4 card majors 1S is somewhat questionable, and the double a bit more so holding 3 clubs |pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Declarer ran the hearts then played a small @S|pg||
nt|babs59: regarding last board, many people move with 8 HCP opposite a 15-17 NT|pg||
nt|ppiglett: It just has - 2+2 - claim|pg||

pc|h4|nt|bagman: Now Sementa needs to dicard the clubs and see what happens|pg||
nt|brolucius: The Smith peter is a signal, normally used only in no-trumps. You play high or low on declarer's first suit (when a count signal is not needed) to say something about how much you ...|pg||

pc|h6|nt|barnets: while there appears only 4 losers the entries are tough |pg||

pc|d9|nt|rodvenn: everybody knows this is about the spade q|pg||
nt|athene: giving up a tempo with the club could have been fatal|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|brolucius: There is a general consensus that you should always cue-bid an ace, provided it does not raise the level of the contract. With a second-round control, you can take a view and ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: decline to cue-bid if you are not suitable for a slam. |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Why would you not be suitable for slam with five controls?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Indeed. I would have bid 4@H.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Particularly as East had not bid that suit.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I am asked about controls. The ace is worth two, the king one control|pg||
nt|Walddk4: So AAK = five|pg||
nt|brolucius: It's a slight problem with auctions that have become game-forcing. The needs to cue-bid controls and to show slam suitability clash somewhat.|pg||
nt|bagman: Pressure|pg||
nt|koksoy: 4@H  need  some  effort|pg||
pc|dK|nt|bagman: Sementa is probably especially happy because defending at 2 level with void vs Q9xxx is always quite risky|pg||

nt|Walddk2: So 13 IMPs to Norway on board 6|pg||
nt|rodvenn: if East had had the spade q, he would have bid more strongly|pg||
nt|bagman: This looks like a flat 4@H with an overtrick|pg||

nt|mamos: i think North is worth 3@h if South had rebid 2@D so not quite sure what has happened here|pg||
nt|iain sime: Italy were losing 12 imps anyway so the lead only cost two more.|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I think, by David's measure, Zia must be the best player in the world, for who wouldn't want him on their team?|pg||
nt|brolucius: A diamond lead seems to look right from that East hand.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, he would pick up the whole world.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Same with Meckstroth and Rodwell, and the great Italians.|pg||
nt|petergill: As we are seeing, 3@H can be beaten |pg||
nt|Gerben42: +80 almost never feels bad|pg||
nt|Gerben42: EW turn again|pg||

nt|Gerben42: 5@D the top spot|pg||
nt|petergill: In 1@H, North's play was just fine, was the safest way to play 1@H|pg||

nt|atabey: T/O and goodish|pg||
nt|othered1: A possible line on last h and is to cash @HA then try to get @D discard on 4th @S.  I don't think that's best, however.|pg||
nt|tez: kandemir led @d at the other table..interesting now|pg||
nt|daman: will probably end up in 4@Hs on this|pg||
nt|andyv:  probably with good reason|pg||
nt|cicus: I'm waiting for that opportunity|pg||
nt|gulyas: unless its mp scoring, where anything goes|pg||
nt|hedyg: A@H and small @D?|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can easily win the top two trumps and crossruff in diamonds and spades|pg||
nt|skorchev: hi all|pg||
nt|mdgraham: when people open with 10 and respond with 3 you sometimes need a natural NT bid|pg||
nt|ziff:  Would be a lot easier if he were either weaker or stronger|pg||
nt|rv: South will X here for game try and 3@s should just be competitive|pg||
nt|toral5: 3nt coming up here|pg||
nt|tokay1975: defence  can shorten declarer 2 times with clubs against best defence  i thk cannot be made 4|pg||
nt|toral5: ya.thts wt i was thinking|pg||
nt|robinswr: they like to open 1club with 4-4 in minors i like 1diamond|pg||

nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
nt|andyv:  http://bit.ly/cLqzVV|pg||
nt|capercliff: if he went up with the K then they need to give him 10 tricks?|pg||
nt|bagman: It is possible that E leads a club and then a spade back forces declarer to go up|pg||
nt|bagman: He'll do fine with a diamond lead|pg||
nt|bagman: It's hard to locate a weakness in partner's 4 card suit|pg||
nt|andyv:  a lot riding on the opening lead|pg||
nt|pasker: true lauria might not lead a @S|pg||
nt|brolucius: Take-out double a good move from West - suggests spades but does not go past 3@H.|pg||
nt|petergill: 5@D plays better than 3NT|pg||
nt|barnets: not so safe|pg||
nt|barnets: with bad club break|pg||
nt|toral5: on a @C lead say he plays @S in dummy and leads a @H|pg||
nt|robinswr: usually right to lead heart here|pg||
nt|robinswr: maybe even the king|pg||
nt|toral5: can shorten ONLY once whn in with @H ace|pg||
nt|toral5: he ll end up getting 5@S+4@H+1@C|pg||
nt|tokay1975: this is a push probably|pg||
nt|milton_se: preferred 2NT|pg||
nt|toral5: this is a non yawner.courtesy 3-1 @C|pg||
mb|3N|nt|othered1: assuming @D lead, of course|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Huge opportunity here|pg||
nt|hedyg: except if he claims 9, yes|pg||
nt|hedyg: then it is his problem|pg||
nt|capercliff: hmm, 1@s not forcing here?|pg||
nt|bagman: does not force as he might have a heart loser|pg||
nt|bagman: so even in that case declarer takes the spade finesse|pg||
nt|sybarra: I see 8 tricks |pg||
nt|mamos: yes|pg||
nt|marlowepi: we will continue to see that number:)|pg||

nt|fabsayc: the idea is to offer a choice between 3nt and 4s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I wonder if 1NT shows clubs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I am not sure I agree with Røn's approach here. Why give them the room to exchange information?|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceblue: Zhou doest think it is 16HCP since of the stiff @HQ|pg||
nt|stc: 3@s(170) better the 5@dx-1 !|pg||
nt|stc: or even 140|pg||
nt|iain sime: Or minus 400 (3NT if a club lead)|pg||
nt|hedyg: in the mean time 10 more imps to Italy|pg||
nt|athene: with no overruff possible, he will end up making nine tricks|pg||
nt|skorchev: 3@H by South is either slam interest with @S fit or @S fit, balanced fit, intending to play 3nt/4@S|pg||
nt|skorchev: *balanced hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: you can use this idea over a 1NT opening|pg||
nt|bagman: Sementa has goodish spade intermediates and a fitting Q + singleton|pg||
nt|paulg:  from what I've seen, it is wrong to describe any Duboin as invitational ... it is just a transfer for Sementa to bid game|pg||
nt|koksoy: :)|pg||
nt|rv: Gabrielle's raise to 4@s seems to be very optimistic|pg||
nt|robinswr: declarer oftens has a singleton heart here|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Versace just said he expects Lauria to have a 4441 on this auction|pg||
nt|haans: all roads ...|pg||
nt|peachy: Play of this one is uncomplicated, I'll go for coffee (it is still morning here)|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: nice selfcontrol by Assael|pg||
nt|hedyg: anyhow isn't it more likely he plays a @d back?|pg||
nt|bagman: yes|pg||
nt|hedyg: where 4@s was bid and made|pg||
nt|hedyg: on bd 7|pg||
nt|bagman: Sementa might duck this to keep multiple options|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Girls need a deck of cards... A @H to love a man, a @D to marry him, a @C to whack him in the head and a @S to bury him|pg||
nt|babs59: I hadn't heard that one before!|pg||
nt|mdgraham: double smacks of bidding his hand twice imho |pg||

nt|mdgraham: don't see why you should|pg||
nt|othered1: I don't think the @DX shows great length, unless that's their agreement, rather than just suggesting a lead.|pg||
nt|haans: @D for the 9th|pg||
nt|viren169: What would you lead from West's hand?|pg||
pc|c5|nt|mbruun: Gutsy play|pg||
nt|paulg:  their CC does not say that 1@s is non-forcing|pg||
nt|capercliff: maybe they play it as limited|pg||
nt|athene: even though he sort of has 3 clubs, trump, diamond to lose|pg||

pc|c6|nt|brolucius: Indeed. It is quite a modest opening bid - not so close to a strong 1@C.|pg||

nt|bagman: :)|pg||
nt|barnets: this rates to be down|pg||
nt|bagman: No the defense has to commit to some line|pg||
nt|bagman: they can draw trumps to prevent the diamond ruffs but then Sementa can set up the hearts|pg||
nt|koksoy: if  defence  can  able to  play  3rd diamond ..  then  they  may  have 2spade heart and  dimond|pg||
nt|paulg:  he is a little short of entries to do everything though|pg||
nt|koksoy: diamond  now|pg||
nt|schtsch: really? maybe he can count his honors?|pg||
nt|rv: this deal cries for a trump lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes and get partner in later with a diamond for her to play another trump|pg||
nt|drorp: Barbosa feels is AKJ642 is worth spade bids, so he'll have to play with a 6-0 fit, luckily everything is well for him so this can make 11 tricks|pg||
nt|drorp: 4 spade bids*|pg||
nt|athene: just one spade and @DA to lose|pg||
nt|robinswr: missing the 109 of clubs only one way to play it|pg||
nt|rhelle: indeed - and no guess because he doesn't have the @c9|pg||
nt|robinswr: king of hearts would have been better just in case the jack was the queen|pg||
nt|toral5: yes|pg||
nt|robinswr: with lack of entries maybe right to lead low to keep flexibility|pg||
nt|toral5: now he cant play @H|pg||
nt|toral5: ahh brd 6 turned out to be a PUSH|pg||
nt|rhelle: that is not unexpected|pg||
nt|rhelle: the problem is the lead; and when partner bids 4@s, he may well have done so on a partial @d fit|pg||
nt|othered1: But it's not ridiculous to reason that way.|pg||
nt|idc: That's true, but it is a 'straw in the wind' to make @c finesse a little more likely|pg||
nt|toral5: :)|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|paulg:  and even if it did, i would raise|pg||
nt|xenya: somewhat unlucky for Norway -- 5@D is a sensible contract|pg||

nt|ahri: i must admit that i like 3@h|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Madala showing his hand, S W laughing|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Looks a 3@H raise to me on his first turn. We saw Blakset's overcall before; he could be quite strong|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He had an 18 count then|pg||
nt|rhelle: so it's not easy to visualise a @d singleton|pg||
nt|toral5: once @C 9 appears he ll b forced to play ace 2nd time|pg||

nt|andyv:  nice method|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: :) I saved it from the last time you sent it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Ah right|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: But it's not on the match sheet, too much of a match for the EBL computers, I suppose|pg||
nt|xenya: a small spade at trick 2 would hvae beaten 3@H, but how could W  know the Jack was singleton|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: (Only because the keyboards are set to English and aren't suitable for accents)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Jacob Røn was in the team when Denmark won the World Championships for juniors in 1998|pg||

nt|petergill: when a @D is led towards dummy, South needs to duck. Is this hard?|pg||
nt|lesniak: tak|pg||
nt|paulg:  if he ruffed two diamonds, then he'd need the club finesse for a heart pitch and doesn't have the entries for that ....|pg||
nt|paulg:  unless the defence helps!|pg||

pc|d9|nt|pasker: as pointed out by spec the 9@S is going to be good enough on a @S lead|pg||
nt|bagman: Ducking would have been double dummy play; imagine partner with AJxx(x)|pg||
nt|drorp: either way, he will make 10 tricks|pg||
pc|s7|nt|brgpro: that would be a quick one down, even without @h ruffs|pg||

pc|dJ|nt|brolucius: Declarer must be careful now in the trump suit. Yes, well played!|pg||
nt|mamos: pretty sure @H finesse is wrong now|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes too many @H's discards from W |pg||
nt|Gerben42: this will also test Madala|pg||
nt|petergill: Will be interesting to see what Madala does at other table|pg||
nt|petergill: Very tough play - the sort of play that the champions often find|pg||
nt|barnets: in the open declarer played a @D from hand at trcik 2 better I think and madala made a fine play of ducking his K|pg||
nt|petergill: Agustin Madala ducked, I am told|pg||
nt|idc: Of course, I missed the most important point as usual|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|athene: declarer had no chance to set up the spades|pg||
nt|athene: as dummy was short of entries|pg||
nt|athene: but now he is running seriously short of tricks|pg||
nt|athene: even though west only has two obvious winners (@CA, trump)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: now 8, not 7|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W held his diamonds because N might have had diamond ace instead of heart ace|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N still has the chance of a defensive error earlier, i.e. E failing to unl;ock spade ten from QTxx|pg||
nt|marlowepi: then a diamond exit would see him home|pg||
pc|dT|nt|andyv:  yes...Lauria would have had to lead something other than the 5@d to give Versace a chance to duck|pg||
nt|vasmar: this is a disadvantage of leading low from 10xxx|pg||
pc|d7|nt|rv: Roland are these 2 teams in contention for medals?|pg||
nt|athene: the @SJ is definitely an error there|pg||
nt|athene: doesn't help to pin the nine|pg||

pc|h3|nt|mamos: east not thinking???|pg||

nt|hedyg: Italy pulling ahead|pg||
nt|othered1: On slam hand, Bocci did play @HA after @D lead, so I may have to reconsider my "not best" comment.|pg||
nt|atabey: this was very cheap for duboin-sementa. could be a disaster after the dbl|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: lol Ed|pg||
nt|daman: with the undo|pg||
nt|athene: surely he must have ruffed that diamond?|pg||
nt|athene: oh well|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: lol, they said -3 just before I entered the claim. Versace shielded his last couple of cards so I was going out on a limb|pg||
nt|daman: now 3NT for EW|pg||
nt|sybarra: off the schneid |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Where does that term come from?|pg||
nt|mbruun: The table has turned |pg||
nt|capercliff: N is worth at least a curtiousy raise even if 1@s is non-forcing|pg||
nt|capercliff: very lucky 4@s is not on|pg||
nt|hedyg: they played 4@s|pg||
nt|xenya: not by much though|pg||
nt|brolucius: The four Italian goalkeepers are keeping a clean sheet at the moment.|pg||
nt|bagman: with solid hearts he should have gone up; with Qxxx missing the spade finesse is one of his chances to make|pg||
nt|snetram:  W tych mistrzostwach nie wystarczy wygrywac wysoko ze sÅabymi. LiczÄ sie tylko wyniku z silnymi. mamy na naszym koncie juÅ¼ dwa zÅe rezultaty z druzynami, ktÃ³re awansuja do drugiej fazy.|pg||

nt|mamos: :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: :)|pg||
nt|cicus: 3NT seems lucky here|pg||
nt|athene: strange to play 3nt with a 5-4 spade fit and two unbalanced hands|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Sorry, declarer played a @C|pg||

nt|andyv:  S didn't realize she could have played a low @h on @h switch from W and may have made it.|pg||
nt|petergill: The auction, with the 3@d raise, suggested EW HCP are about 12-9. |pg||
nt|petergill: @DA makes that 8-9|pg||
nt|corplaw: easy 4S contract|pg||
nt|ahri: if you see commentating pause, it's penalties on world cup at the moment.|pg||

nt|rv: yes Bas, still virtue is its own reward:)|pg||
nt|rv: smoke breaks allowed in middle of round?|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/10Ostend/Results.htm|pg||
nt|cumino: Strange play in the other room. The opponents played @h and the declarer trump|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: Oh well, as long as I have you for those letters ;)|pg||
nt|idc: Bocchi passed, and has shown K,A,K, so cannot have @cQ|pg||
nt|toral5: once @S q was not inserted,def was in ctrl|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceblue: Muiderberg 2@S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 13 IMPs to Italy on 7. The Italians found the defence against 3NT. @HQ to the ace and a diamond switch|pg||
nt|toral5: another 3nt coming up.this time for the dutch|pg||
mb|p|nt|brgpro: 6@d needs @hA to be on...|pg||
nt|brolucius: That deal is worthy of another look afterwards. Very instructive that Bocchi established the spades before playing on trumps. |pg||
nt|brgpro: not that bad but hard to reach|pg||
nt|capercliff: oh i see:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: -2|pg||
nt|capercliff: it will be flat I think|pg||
nt|lesniak: Adam man nadzieje da staymana|pg||

nt|andyv:  suits aren't good enough and vul not right for W to come in|pg||
nt|pasker: I'm not a big fan of the 4@H opening with a poorish suit and some defence|pg||
nt|pasker: but has worked out well enough here|pg||
nt|vasmar: first seat you mean|pg||
nt|andyv:  if that's all you have in your arsenal, you may as well use it|pg||
nt|bagman: W comes in with 4NT?|pg||
nt|andyv:  -500|pg||
nt|bagman: IT cannot be S thinking|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: W blocking out all sound now, hands over his eyes and fingers in his ears|pg||
nt|andyv:  but may talk N into bidding on|pg||
nt|bagman: over 4NT N can bid on with X|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I haven't even done a slamtease yet ;)|pg||
nt|hedyg: rofl|pg||
nt|barnets: it is better for dec to play th @D at trick 2 before the defense know what is going on|pg||
nt|petergill: Well deserved imps to Italy |pg||
nt|barnets: if the clubs are good they will always be good|pg||
nt|athene: but a pre-empt can do that to you|pg||
nt|athene: one area of the game where i am sure most pairs don't have enough methods is after a 3nt overcall of a pre-empt|pg||
nt|gulyas: 4@S makes more tricks - in fact, you  have to guess @Ss to to make 3NT at all|pg||
nt|athene: it can cover such a wide range of shapes and strengths, you need a lot of kit to investigate the best game or slam|pg||

nt|athene: more game swings to italy|pg||
nt|athene: 4@S failed when declarer didn't sneak the diamond through before crossruffing|pg||
nt|Walddk2: From bad to worse. The Danes never found the spade switch against 3NT on board 7|pg||
nt|toral5: luks gets LOT of hcps|pg||
nt|toral5: kibs want some fireworks now|pg||
nt|haans: me 2|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: we all do|pg||
nt|viren169: 2@C here|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|Walddk4: Spades and a minor, 5-5|pg||
nt|petergill: which makes East about a 9/17 chance of having @HA in my opinion, so it was a close guess in @H|pg||
nt|athene: and 1nt - 3nt - east didn't double for a spade lead and west didn't find @SKx lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They had 3 chances|pg||
nt|rhelle: 1NT = 12.5 - 15|pg||
mb|2S|nt|andyv:  probably need a @c lead to stop 4@s|pg||
nt|bjacobs: German term|pg||
nt|petergill: Possibly, but at Trick 2 it seems natural to duck to retain your entry. At Trick 4, perhaps it seemed less clear?|pg||
nt|athene: 2@H rather than 3@H makes things much easier|pg||
nt|athene: now transfer and west will do something very enthusiastic|pg||
nt|athene: to show his monster support for spades|pg||
nt|gulyas: 6@S makes with good guesses, not likely to be bid tho|pg||
nt|cicus: still not an easy overcall, double is a sensible alternative|pg||
nt|athene: west wants to play game facing just five spades and a yarborough, pretty much|pg||
nt|lesniak: oczywiscie uzylibysmy innych przymiotnikow gdyby S mial K trefl|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: np :)|pg||
nt|paulg:  1@d promises 0 diamonds, not an ideal start to this hand|pg||
nt|bagman: Is N going to bury the @Hs|pg||
nt|andyv:  balancing with W hand ok in mp... but not great in imps.|pg||
nt|lechcold: witamy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: One can't find the lead from Kx of course, but Askgaard had another two opportunities|pg||
nt|athene: 2@S shows 4 spades and 6-card minor|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He ducked hearts twice and then it was all over|pg||
nt|milton_se: another 3NT|pg||
nt|othered1: Right about the trick 1 play|pg||
nt|toral5: i wd love 2 pd him in rubber if he agrees:)|pg||
nt|yuval10: strong @c here for NS|pg||
nt|peachy: Strong artificial 1C|pg||
nt|yuval10: perhaps it will allow them to play in 1 here|pg||
nt|toral5: :)|pg||
nt|viren169: showing <16 with clubs|pg||
nt|toral5: ok.i ll put it this way.kibs n commentators want fireworks|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk4: A Dutch invention|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Google solves all|pg||
nt|bagman: nice result in the open room|pg||
nt|bagman: Difficult situation. 5m can go down a lot and there was no guarantees that 4@H makes|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: South correctly makes no move towards game. He expects that the deal is a mis-fit and his hearts will pull little weight with spades as trumps.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 3@C seems sadistic|pg||
nt|mdgraham: apart from translating the NASZ system....|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@S is the limit and even that is not cold|pg||
nt|bagman: NS can make 5@C|pg||
nt|paulg:  3@d looks like a mixed raise in spades|pg||
nt|paulg:  so 4-card support plus a good card or two|pg||
nt|bagman: Denning has more or less shown only his range without much info about his shape|pg||
nt|paulg:  Denning might bid four or five diamonds|pg||
nt|bagman: Now it's quite hard to recover from the start|pg||
nt|paulg:  i think 5@d |pg||
nt|paulg:  three major suit cards, fit with partner, excellent suit|pg||
nt|schtsch: no action from tesla, pity|pg||
nt|schtsch: wrong vulerability|pg||
nt|ahri: 2@c is GF|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: flat super accept|pg||
nt|athene: i can't see any reason for declarer to drop the @SK here|pg||
nt|april7: 2NT is Truscott I think, but E proposes 3NT|pg||
nt|drorp: Italians continue to bid aggrresivley, and unless Versace can find the stiff K@s, it won't work for them this time aswell|pg||
nt|athene: you might make 4@S even if you lose to the @SK - you won't make 3nt|pg||
nt|athene: in 4@S you might hold the losers to @SK, @HA, and @CA, throwing a club on a heart eventually|pg||
nt|athene: brave of declarer to play a second heart rather than hoping for 3-3 clubs|pg||
nt|athene: but i guess after the club lead he knew a 3-3 split was very unlikely|pg||
nt|athene: maybe he just operated on the principle "if west didn't lead a spade either of his first two opportunities, he won't lead one on his third" :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Blakset left for the bathroom, Duboin thinking|pg||
nt|athene: if EW are going to bid a slam, they had better put north on lead|pg||
nt|athene: since he isn't the one with the fairly obvious lead :)|pg||
nt|athene: i think if west ended up 6@H, north would lead a club|pg||
nt|Walddk2: At long last, Denmark on the board. 3@H went 1 down on 8 in the other room|pg||
nt|athene: probably EW in the other room play upside down count and west could read the @SJ as a singleton|pg||
nt|ppiglett: 3N for n/s unless E-W want to get involved and get Dbled|pg||
nt|mdgraham: once again the overcall on ace-ten-nine fifth|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: tah dah|pg||
nt|bagman: They have loaded quite a lot into 1@D opening as their 2@C opening shows 6 or more|pg||
nt|athene: i guess EW aren't making a slam even if they escape the club lead, anyway|pg||
nt|athene: on this board|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Denied|pg||
nt|viren169: No fireworks here|pg||
pc|c7|nt|iceblue: 2NT shud be Lebensohl|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3NT?|pg||
nt|sybarra: does S pass?|pg||
nt|hedyg: not sure Versace was bidding 4@H freely|pg||
nt|hedyg: E bid 2@C in OR|pg||
nt|sharkey: Madala did not have a good match earlier today vs Norway but sure has reddemed himself in this match|pg||
nt|hedyg: and S doubled to show a good hand|pg||
nt|bagman: N might not make a move nv|pg||
nt|hedyg: Italy won 21:9 vs Norway|pg||
nt|hedyg: that looks pretty good to me|pg||
nt|brolucius: Incredible that the Italians should actually make two cue-bids on such values. Do they see a potential slam on every deal?|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - cud have been much more...|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4 VPs more?|pg||
nt|bagman: W should not bid to sac but to make (on this vulnerability)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But declarer can overtake spades when the 10 falls and should be OK in 3|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@H raise should include 4333 10 counts. |pg||
nt|lesniak: nasi grali 4 pik z kontra , dostali wist 3 razy trefl= ksiazka/ odwrot karo i buras niepotrzebnie wstawil K karo- w efekcie byl bez 2|pg||
nt|haans: shorter kibs+us|pg||
nt|toral5: is 2@C precision style?|pg||
nt|haans: yes|pg||
pc|cT|nt|bjacobs: I don't get it - South passes 1@S, why would North then venture 3@C with that hand?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: South had no choice|pg||
nt|mdgraham: why 3@C facing a partner who passed 1@S?|pg||
nt|sybarra: another canape sequence here |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Lucky club position|pg||
nt|bagman: And now p p 5@C|pg||
pc|cA|nt|capercliff: Piper is out for blood now|pg||

nt|koksoy: 4nt  ?  now  to  choose  a  minor|pg||
nt|koksoy: he  thinks  wh  has  hearts?|pg||
nt|bagman: The problem with 4NT is that W gets a freeroll to X|pg||
nt|athene: a surprising choice from lauria there|pg||
nt|athene: now the scoreboard really is all square :)|pg||
nt|athene: thanks to bocchi taking a good view not to transfer|pg||
nt|april7: the contract depends on how W plays the @S suit, he can make 3@H,2@D 1@C and perhaps 3 @S, before NS has 5  tricks|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Yalcin Atabey|pg||
nt|athene: if he loses to the @SK the defence will definitely have @SK, two diamonds, and two aces|pg||
nt|april7: K of @D and @H 10, then if he doesn't make the finesse in @S because he wants to play @H from dummy he wil  be rewarded|pg||
nt|athene: but he definitely needs the spades as well as the hearts|pg||
nt|athene: i don't see how he can refuse the spade finesse|pg||
nt|atabey: ty roland :) hi all|pg||
nt|athene: hi|pg||
nt|athene: there's plenty of room for south to have a double without the @SK|pg||

nt|jkotor: cisza przed burz¹?|pg||
nt|tokay1975:  not easy  after a sp lead he has  to duck |pg||
nt|jillan:  a Swdish friend told me that in a match Swedn:Iceland Peter played agains Magnus nd Magus, and after 12 realying rounds the Swedes end up in 7@H. Petre puts the cards straight back into teh fold and says to his Magnus, you should lead a @D. |pg||
nt|toral5: ian time AGAIN to shout FLAT GAME?|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|brolucius: A direct 3@H would show values, so West travels via a Lebensohl 2NT to show a weak hand with hearts.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muiderberg_convention|pg||
nt|athene: leads a top spade to see which red suit to attack|pg||
nt|daman: 9 toppers   may be room for an overtrick |pg||
nt|capercliff: we all need to remember that the play is very fast at this table, hard for the operator to keep up sometimes|pg||
nt|hedyg: Bas is doing fine :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: bd 8 Swiss played 5@DX= for 12 imps|pg||
nt|iain sime: Should manage six trump, two clubs and a diamond.|pg||
nt|athene: ok - now it's harder :) |pg||
nt|cicus: this won't make declarer sweat|pg||
nt|athene: short of putting the stop card down and bidding 4@S, west can't really superaccept now unless he wants to risk the 5-level, which he really can't|pg||
nt|hedyg: 12 tricks are there|pg||
nt|toral5: dutch playing strong @C here?|pg||
nt|toral5: many tricks here|pg||
nt|yuval10: indeed.....and a 7 easy tricks|pg||
nt|peachy: good stop, helped by their system|pg||
nt|yuval10: Bulgaria will take the lead after this board|pg||
nt|toral5: lol haans|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|viren169: 2@C= opening hand with 6+ clubs or 5+ clubs and a major|pg||
nt|viren169: Not sure there is any style in it!|pg||
nt|toral5: precision 2@C is ok 4 me viren:)|pg||
nt|toral5: lol|pg||
nt|viren169: It is part of their kit-bag, so it must be bid!|pg||
nt|toral5: 3@C wd ve gone only 1 down;courtesy @D qx|pg||
nt|viren169: With or w/out style!|pg||
pc|dK|nt|brolucius: 2@C is game-forcing balanced or diamond support.|pg||
nt|brgpro: they are on they way...with a lot of relays i think...although we dont really know their agreements|pg||
nt|atabey: on board 7 the lead to 6@h was a dia. declarer didnt take the @h finess. however he could pitch the @d's to @c ace and the 4th @s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Madala's 1NT backfired in the other room|pg||
nt|sharkey: in VP no - IMPs yes :)|pg||
nt|bagman: Now N has values to do something|pg||
nt|hedyg: David when your pd shows a strong hand an ace, a king and Qx in pds suit is not a lot?|pg||
nt|bagman: X or 3@S|pg||
nt|bagman: depending on agreements on X|pg||
nt|lesniak: dobrze wykonane|pg||
nt|bagman: S had already shown a fine @D suit. Now it was time to show some support for partner|pg||
nt|idc: When it is a strong 1@c, players like to interfere on anything (and quite right too)|pg||
nt|idc: ok, on you go Sapan...|pg||
nt|toral5: lol:)|pg||
nt|othered1: overcall of forcing @C can be different from overcall of a natural opening, as objectives differ.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: agree, but 1@D isn't much of an interference|pg||
pc|d8|nt|dougdscsu: Bas is god|pg||
nt|hedyg: oh my|pg||
nt|mamos: 3Nt coming|pg||
nt|marlowepi: for most of us, not an appetizing approach to describing the E hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is played from the other side |pg||
nt|andyv:  10 more imps for Bulgaria is Italy stopped at 3@d on board 5|pg||
nt|jillan:  Noone says anyrthing more, and everyone put theis cards in |pg||
pc|d2|nt|brgpro: my guess is: 2@d=extra length or Bal. min. and 2@h asked which, 2@s showed the later|pg||
nt|brolucius: An initial response of 3@C would be 8-11 natural.|pg||
nt|jtr: It needs very specific cards facing a weak NT which i imagine Bocchi has shown by now|pg||
nt|jtr: Madala is maybe just looking for the best game|pg||
nt|brolucius: It would be quite a system triumph to identify that you were CLOSE to a slam. |pg||
nt|brgpro: the perfect card S can find is: xx  KQx xxxxx Akx|pg||
nt|brolucius: xx/Axxx/AKx/Qxxx also good.|pg||
nt|brgpro: that isn't that min....he might rebid 2NT with that|pg||
nt|brgpro: now he is on the corss road...go beyond 3NT or not...|pg||
nt|jtr: I imagine 2@d showed the weak NT with 2NT showing something else  Common methods which i myself use|pg||
nt|brolucius: The convention card says 2NT rebid is 12-14 balanced but may not be bid with x-x in a suit. Here he has a low doubleton spade.|pg||
nt|jtr: I cant see that David|pg||
nt|brgpro: so 2NT asked his weakness and 3@s showed it?|pg||
nt|brolucius: At the end of the notes - last section.|pg||
nt|jtr: ah!|pg||
nt|jtr: Wow you are efficient!|pg||
nt|brolucius: In fact 2NT rebid is 11-14 balanced, with no low doubleton.|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am spurred into action by the presence of top-class commentators alongside.|pg||
nt|hedyg: lucky to find K@H with 3 @ss|pg||
nt|atabey: so it was unbeatable afterall. the lead didnt matter|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Fayad values the hand as stronger than Versace did in othr room .. but they still stop short of game|pg||
nt|capercliff: maybe its Lauria's turn to only claim 10?:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: esp when opps can bid spades, highly likely when u r short there, your main suit can get buried|pg||
nt|mamos: no double because it asked for a spade nd here Spade holder on lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: but he found the lead |pg||
nt|Gerben42: only the best graduate from the Blue Team bridge school|pg||
nt|barnets: well clearly north likes to bid a lot|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Some play XX here instead of 3@H has an invite to 4@H so that 3@H can be used for competition, or just push opps out|pg||

nt|jtr: Ah of course, they cant have 18-19 balanced|pg||
nt|sharkey: The way this match is going may also influence NS bidding here|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't think EW need to speculate|pg||
nt|petergill: Janis Ozols likes to compete, as we saw earlier on a hand that cost 5 imps|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: EW amazed at dummy|pg||
nt|gulyas: this another 2 imps to HUN, regardless of making 5 or 6|pg||

nt|skorchev: Bulgaria won 10 imps in board 5, since Madala-Bocchi stopped at 3@D+2 ... (5@D= was played here)|pg||
nt|tokay1975: this is hard play  cause  he has to know 62 spades and dia finesse off|pg||
pc|dA|nt|jtr: They open 2@c with that|pg||
nt|brgpro: i think 4NT shows odd number of key cards....i played a lot of Italian pairs, still dont quite understand their turbo method|pg||
nt|brolucius: If anyone bid and made 6@D against me on these cards, I would think that I was not destined to win the match.|pg||
nt|hedyg: lets try not to exaggerate :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: wudnt bet on it....:)|pg||
nt|bagman: If he ever gets to dummy|pg||
nt|sybarra: I would hard pressed to find a low sp lead from the N holding |pg||

nt|snetram:  ale zagrania dwa razy atu- poÅÄczone z impasem - wygrywa|pg||
nt|koksoy: @S R lead  overtaken by  A  and  diamond  ...  now??  decision  time|pg||
nt|bagman: South might guess this; the defense would have played 2 rounds of spades if there was need for @D finesse|pg||
nt|othered1: They do seem to have adopted that philosophy that if you don't overcall at 1-level you don't have any long suit.|pg||

pc|s7|nt|brgpro: not that bad...only a little less than 50% slam...|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, it's not a bad slam particularly but difficult to bid, as you said earlier.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://psbridge.gotdns.com/bbo/allvug/  - Vugraph Hand Records (PDF)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: lol thanks all (and Doug)|pg||
nt|capercliff: im not really sure what to say about this auction|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: It was actually (again!) someone coming in for the BM|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I should just gag them...|pg||
nt|bagman: Now @H + spade guarantees set if E has Qxx of diamonds|pg||
nt|schtsch: sorry for this cheering, we are watching football and i got carried away|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 1@D showed 13 cards and that's no lie|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|brolucius: If you don't play a two-suited 2@S, then many would open a normal weak 2@S on that North hand.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Correction, the minor can be four cards only|pg||
nt|brolucius: Anyway, it seems that they had a splendid investigative auction and decided, very reasonably, to stay out of it.|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: In Pairs it might've been easier, raising 5@D to 6@D because it's bad score anyway :)|pg||
nt|daman: he need to play a @S or a @D|pg||
nt|athene: so even if it's against a game in the other room that might be ok|pg||
nt|ppiglett: Played for 11. might have had a dble squeeze for 12.|pg||

nt|Walddk2: I counted them|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|daman: s|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can be pretty sure the @DA is right|pg||
nt|hedyg: S thought pd had singleton @S not to raise to 3@s|pg||
pc|s5|nt|bagman: Sementa probably reasoned that N must have the @CK to pass|pg||
nt|sharkey: still need to locate a few honors yet so too early to play for drop|pg||
nt|bagman: And so far, he really cannot draw inferences from the nyances in S's defensive play|pg||

nt|athene: yes but that's irrelevant - leading to the nine is just as bad as leading to the queen|pg||
nt|drorp: italians win 8 when Bocchi chooses not to transfer on board 7|pg||
pc|s3|nt|capercliff: im told to say "certifiable":)|pg||
nt|rodvenn: 5 @c was a much better contract on 7 than 3NT. Deserved to gain|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: There's an orchestra practising just on the other side of a wall here|pg||
nt|babs59: I would have thought West would continue the trump attack|pg||
nt|corplaw: 10 imps for croatia|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The auction indicated that both opponents had a spade control, but did they say anything about clubs?|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|daman: yes|pg||
nt|athene: firstly @SAK @DA is 1@S not 2@S|pg||
nt|toral5: missed the trump promotion here|pg||
pc|c5|nt|atabey: kolata did not dbl 2@h. which I believe was a better move. and he earned 5 imps|pg||
nt|athene: secondly with the @DA north would be more likely to just clear the spades|pg||
nt|rodvenn: the 6 points on 5 is also well deserved to Italy, but the 10imps on 1 is slightly lucky|pg||
pc|cK|nt|bagman: Now south wanted the @ST back|pg||

nt|snetram:  Åwietnie siÄ broni Cezary, ale na maksy S miaÅby problem|pg||
nt|koksoy: nice  defence..|pg||
nt|bagman: West cannot believe that S has Axx of clubs|pg||
pc|c2|nt|bagman: Technically and in isolation, declarer should have lead @HJ to pick up KTx onside. Here, however, the @HJ was needed to guard against diamond overruf|pg||
nt|marlowepi: once W bids the suit you have to lead a low one at IMPs|pg||
nt|wstuart: not until he cashes his @CA  :)|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|schtsch: trump promotion|pg||
nt|schtsch: not needed though|pg||
nt|athene: this will surely be a loss - maybe small loss against 3@S, maybe big loss against 4@S making|pg||
nt|athene: the best they can hope for is a flat board against 4@S-1|pg||
nt|athene: well they bid a slam knowing south had long clubs|pg||
pc|sK|nt|hedyg: and a @c back|pg||
nt|brolucius: After a club lead (against that 5@D doubled), declarer simply drew trumps and set up a club winner in the South hand to pitch the spade loser from dummy.|pg||
nt|paulg:  not an easy situation to read|pg||
nt|tokay1975: only way to make  is to duck spade win next or third  and play jack of hearts but this is open cards play|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: ok, he isn't risking the contract for an overtrick|pg||
nt|athene: fair enough|pg||
nt|hedyg: why not K@H before @s finesse?|pg||
nt|gulyas: just plain Dumbovich, getting everything right|pg||
nt|ziff:  More or less the same defence at both tables|pg||
pc|s6|nt|Vugraphznk: Declarer took a finesse from dummy, but I have no clue how...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: too unlikely that partner has 2 tricks of his own|pg||
nt|barnets: in the open north was content with just 1 X|pg||
nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@h on a @s lead would have been (only just) -1, but the 4@S overcall at this vulnerability is normal|pg||
nt|toral5: ll cross ruff the rest|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|hedyg: he could have played the 9|pg||

nt|yuval10: the @s lead was effective, yet still 10 tricks|pg||

nt|mdgraham: it's not an ideal world, even though it's the only one we've got|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: I know play X=M, 1NT=m, 1x is t/o of that suit|pg||
nt|othered1: I think it is not allowed in ACBL.  Proscription of bids meant solely to obstruct, particularly on random hands.|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Fairly simple :)|pg||
nt|toral5: why is 3@C alerted?|pg||
nt|othered1: puppet Stayman, perhaps?|pg||
nt|toral5: on weak 2nt?|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  watching online you would always think that Wilkinson is the old man of the partnership|pg||
nt|fabsayc: what is 3@C|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Minimum|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@D asking for shortage I believe, not sure|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: With NS overcalling style, the S hand would be considered a maximum, right?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well not a minimum for sure|pg||
nt|bagman: S hoping that the @HK is with length|pg||
nt|hedyg: their CC says they play Ghestem|pg||
nt|barnets: west bid 2@S and that was that|pg||
nt|bagman: This should be fast -2 on a spade lead|pg||

mb|p|nt|brolucius: The Open Room results are not being updated on my MOVIE, but I am told that... Iceland made 4@s in 8, and played 3NT+2 in 9|pg||

nt|atabey: 2@d will be final contract|pg||

nt|mbruun: I just dont like that pattern|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: No one likes a 4333 except for when the opps have one|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The textbooks say that you have one heart too many and one spade too few for a take-out double|pg||

nt|Walddk4: What about Chandler's Ford, David?|pg||
nt|atabey: oops|pg||
nt|othered1: I must have the wrong convention card for NS.  It calls for 1@C opening on south's hand.|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: This is interesting|pg||
nt|hedyg: nobody forces Zorlu to anything|pg||
nt|athene: this is unlikely to make|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: ... Lavazza girls ... lol|pg||
nt|daman: serbia gained 12 on Board 9    Italy never got to game in the OR|pg||
nt|daman: he can make this.......double dummy|pg||
nt|athene: the multi-2@D has definitely been outscoring the natural 2@S opener this match|pg||
nt|daman: yes|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Serbia leading Italy by 24 with 9 compared boards, who would've though|pg||
nt|athene: despite common claims that it can't be better to allow opps so much more room|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that never stopped the Italians, and it doesn't seem to do them any harm |pg||
nt|rodvenn: also the board 8 shows better judgement and system by the Italians. |pg||
nt|sharkey: Slovakia off the Schneider??|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, 1NT looks OK.|pg||
nt|sharkey: 1 NT by N may be an alternative as well|pg||
nt|bagman: North hasn't made this, yet|pg||
nt|marlowepi: spade natural lead|pg||
nt|brolucius: 5@D was the obvious move if South does decide to advance.|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Wouldn't this be a 2@D overcall then?|pg||
nt|iain sime: My experience is the same as David's.|pg||
nt|hedyg: no Bas|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Now he only needs to maake it|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I thought 3@C two highest remaining, cuebid two most extreme and 2NT the two lowest|pg||
nt|athene: 3@C from sementa showing less than 8 hcp|pg||
nt|gulyas: same spot, and a likely push|pg||
nt|athene: both sides played it from the singleton hand|pg||
nt|athene: as no-one ever bids clubs to mean clubs these days|pg||
nt|toral5: very lucky 6@D coming up.but they wont bid for sure|pg||
nt|toral5: 4@C has to b BOLD.pd can easily be @C less|pg||
nt|othered1: Yes, why would it be alerted?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: at least they had spades! :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|marlowepi: sometimes you catch Txxxxx with partner and 22. or you may find Axxxx|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@d would be majors|pg||
nt|cicus: and, incidentally, both rooms played the contract from the south hand|pg||
nt|gulyas: OR cos of prec 1@C, and Gazilli here|pg||
nt|cicus: hmm, I should write shorter sentences|pg||
nt|athene: declarer's only decision is whether to try @SAKQ for a diamond discard|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: lol|pg||
nt|athene: i thinky you probably do|pg||
nt|athene: think|pg||
nt|andyv:  a claimer for 5... I wonder what the alert was for.  Maybe NS play NAMYATS|pg||
nt|ziff:  Versace probably is a bit nervous about @D Kx, but he can t right-side the contract anyway, and his partner has the right cards for him|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West will be pleased to see a non-@DQ opening lead|pg||
nt|petergill: On Bd 6, 6@S would be a wonderful contract to reach. Nobody has bid 6@S so far. Here is Group B's scores on Bd 6 http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/runningsc...|pg||
nt|petergill: ores/asp/BoardacrossCondit.asp?qboard=006.18..820|pg||
nt|rv: some also play 3@s on double shows @d stopper in addition to 4@s+5@h|pg||
nt|drorp: X with 9 majors and unbalanced hand when they kinda showed big diamond fit can hardly be wrong, according to the LAW|pg||
nt|athene: south didn't want to bid just 2@H with A A @HQ|pg||
nt|athene: but this is a bit high|pg||
nt|viren169: another dull hand...|pg||
nt|viren169: which club lead?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: FLAT BOARD, Sapan? :)|pg||
pc|c4|nt|atabey: haha|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: lol, he had 2@D out of the box and on the table|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Sorry, I thought he had opened 1@H|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: hard to only make 4 here|pg||
nt|drorp: and on this case it will reward as both 3@S and 3@D make|pg||
nt|atabey: well done by ballancing. 3@s is a good spot for NS|pg||
nt|drorp: who's thinking? and why?|pg||
nt|atabey: maybe it was not a good decision for versace to open in 3rd seat. it might go passed out|pg||
nt|athene: lauria was surely the only person who might have anything to think about over 3@S|pg||

nt|sharkey: by no means no - the way the match has developed so far....|pg||
nt|bagman: Slovakia might get 5 IMPs but this can be also flat|pg||
nt|brolucius: Of course it would be foolish of East to double just because he has loads of points - an insult to the opponents (even if they were not Italian).|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He can, double dummy, but that is not the same as he will|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@d majors, 2NT @H+@C, 3@C @S+@C|pg||
nt|stc: @s is probably best play|pg||
nt|Walddk2: East is squeezed to pieces without the count|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Maybe we play different Ghestems :) So many modifications around these days|pg||
nt|brolucius: Many actual partnerships play different Ghestems, as Iain pointed out.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: See what happens to East if Bocchi cashes lots of trumps|pg||
nt|hedyg: he can drop the @ds?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But then Bocchi can set up spades in comfort|pg||
nt|stc: The last 6 cards are 3@c, 2@s and 1@d|pg||
nt|hedyg: so i think Mossop could have a played a higher card than the 6|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If East has no more diamonds|pg||
nt|hedyg: though*|pg||
nt|hedyg: any reason not to?|pg||
nt|athene: well you might sometimes run into a defensive crossruff where just drawing trumps worked better, but it's pretty unlikely|pg||

nt|schtsch: madala would like to pick 6@c but suit is not a great one|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I think South believes that given he's shown 45 already, how come partner didn't set clubs with 3@C's|pg||
nt|schtsch: enough, though|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: If South has 2434 it is also likely that he would bid 3NT over 2NT|pg||
nt|schtsch: correct, so he is marked with 2425|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Since 2NT over 2@H would most likely deny 4 clubs|pg||

nt|iain sime: This doesn't work if a diamond is played. The squeeze would have worked- East had to keep all his black cards so declarer could have given up a spade.|pg||

nt|hedyg: then he is down immediately|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't think so, Constantin|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is part of the odds of bidding such slams (and well done for bidding it) that the defenders may not be card perfect. It was a tricky one for East.|pg||
nt|stc: E must play @s|pg||
nt|iain sime: Win the lead and play all the trumps would have worked.|pg||
nt|stc: if he ducks the @d E must play @s to beat|pg||
nt|brolucius: East had no idea at all how the diamond suit lay.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It won't help East to come down to 2 spades, 1 diamond and 3 clubs. Then declarer can ruff out the clubs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: There was a legitimate line |pg||
nt|Walddk2: But a little easier for us|pg||
nt|petergill: South had 2 losing choices, give partner a ruff and miss out on @D tricks, or takes winners. He chose the latter|pg||

nt|jbgood: multi, 2@s would have shown 8-11 hcp and 6 cards|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4S easier to make than to bid|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 4@S is one too high, though|pg||
nt|andyv:  a very strong NT|pg||
nt|paulg:  Denning with a Meckwell-style 1@d opener, is there a worse 11 points?|pg||
nt|andyv:  but you are right...4@s would show about 7 tricks and 4@d (namyats) would show about 7.5 to 8 tricks|pg||
nt|babs59: some believe Namyats should have more control of outside suits than that hand - eg singleton in one of the 'less stopped' suits|pg||
nt|athene: 2@C overcall over 1@D causes a lot of problems |pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: Hoftaniska asked me to call the TD|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Not sure what it was all about|pg||

nt|bagman: I've been wrong before, though, in my estimates|pg||
nt|antoniz: jak wysoko dojad¹?|pg||
nt|barnets: In his earlier days young Madala would have opened 4@S as would many- now he opened 1@S and got a plus|pg||

nt|gulyas: or dbl|pg||
nt|cicus: E had many choices here, including X and 1NT|pg||
nt|schtsch: 2@c something|pg||
nt|athene: here for example north has to double, because he isn't strong enough for 2@S|pg||

mb|p|nt|hedyg: i dont like the 2@H bid :(|pg||
nt|hedyg: what is wrong with 2NT?|pg||
nt|brolucius: If Hedy and I would both rebid 2NT it must be right.|pg||

nt|Gerben42: I guess if the Blue Team school told him not to, perhaps we all should listen ?|pg||

mb|p|nt|brolucius: Italya are more likely to win this than England are to beat Slovenia in the World Cup and England are '2-to-1 on'.|pg||

nt|fabsayc: this auction strange, did west really pass 2@H|pg||
nt|fabsayc: diamond suit blocked|pg||
nt|ahri: i am not sure if 6@s was played in best manner, if east held KQx clubs and 4 hearts with jack, bocchi killed his squeeze by playing 3 rounds of hearts first|pg||
nt|athene: if you decided that north had four hearts for his double, and you had to play the heart suit for no losers, you would have to play for the drop |pg||
nt|athene: you can't pick up @HQxxx with north, only @HQx with south|pg||
nt|toral5: 2@S=muiderberg?|pg||

nt|bjacobs: That's a good stop ... it's a tempting hand, but the lack of aces is crucial|pg||
nt|hedyg: and the lead is....directed!|pg||
nt|brolucius: In the old days 1@D - 3@S would show the North hand. Now it is usually used as a splinter bid agreeing diamonds.|pg||
nt|hedyg: disc @c on @d and claim when that works for 11 tricks|pg||
nt|bagman: NS' system card states: NAT: maybe reverse bids|pg||

nt|athene: i guess his reasoning was, partner can still bid 3@S over 3@H if he has four|pg||

nt|bagman: South's hand happens to be on top of my balanced hand range for 1@S opening|pg||

nt|bagman: I would happily accept a game invitation by partner|pg||
nt|bagman: He might play a diamond and then get a spade through|pg||
nt|paulg:  a diamond is probably safe too, as partner will do the right thing|pg||

nt|athene: in the other room 1@D opener will let EW in to find their heart fit, but 2@H should be one down so it won't be a huge swing - maybe an imp to denmark|pg||

nt|hedyg: yes|pg||
nt|hedyg: the 4@c bid may prevent the @c lead|pg||

nt|hedyg: if he picks up the @ds..|pg||
nt|sybarra: oops simpson, did you really want to do that?  |pg||
nt|mamos: Not sure what 1NT was  but West did well to move|pg||

nt|hedyg: if it looks like an opening it is an opening is ok for me. this doesnt look like 1|pg||
nt|iain sime: I don't like it, especially if playing 15/17 as it puts to big a range on the 1NT rebid. But these are openers nowadays, and I have to confess that I would not have passed.|pg||
nt|petergill: At the other table, West played @DK, @DQ then @D to ace, and East played a 4th @D , hoping partner had a spade greaer than the 8|pg||
nt|paulg:  or club and diamond so he does have the problem again|pg||
pc|dA|nt|hedyg: 8@s was an entry to dummy to disc all his losers :(|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: gdyby chodzi³o tylko o nieoddanie wiecej niz jednej ;ewy w pikach przy braku komunikacji by³oby to zagranie poprawne|pg||
pc|d5|nt|pasker: he may also now its from AK bare as potentially no support dble|pg||
nt|petergill: Correct, as at this table, is the low @D at Trick 2|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Gotthard went to the bathroom|pg||
nt|athene: even if Lauria counts the hcp and decides south has the @HQ, he might play to drop it - can't afford to lead the @HJ if it's doubleton|pg||
nt|athene: missing the six and the eight|pg||
nt|athene: and nine|pg||
nt|athene: everyone keeps saying it's easy to guess the @HQ|pg||
nt|athene: it isn't|pg||
nt|athene: you have to guess the shape as well|pg||
nt|april7: only an inspired J of @H will do the job|pg||
nt|atabey: the J of @s is not a good signal. shows the @s position to declarer|pg||
nt|athene: he might try the @H10, hoping south is asleep and doesn't cover with @HQx|pg||
nt|drorp: the spade play of small 1st makes it harder for Lauria to read the shape|pg||
nt|drorp: south could have Qxx aswell, not hard to unblock after partner plays A and J with obvious length|pg||
nt|athene: the main point is not the six-card diamond suit so much as the double of 2@C from north|pg||
nt|athene: we know he hasn't got many points for it so we might be more inclined to play him for the right shape|pg||
nt|athene: i.e. length in both majors|pg||
nt|april7: and since the 4th Q cannot be finessed E might finess S for that card|pg||
nt|atabey: he wont play for the drop thats for sure|pg||
nt|toral5: sd escape 4 100 if he inserts @D 10|pg||
nt|toral5: buth @H ace instead of a @C wd ve secured 300|pg||
nt|yuval10: Q@d will be enough|pg||
nt|toral5: infact  q is corrct.cos he can pitch dummys @D on @S|pg||
nt|yuval10: then @s finesse|pg||

nt|fabsayc: of both aces offside|pg||
nt|toral5: NOT a gr8 play again.|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|brolucius: East has to calculate whether it is worth rising with the @HQ to get West to draw dummy's last trump.|pg||
nt|atabey: usually zorlu has very good instincts|pg||
nt|hedyg: OR stopped in 5@d|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: So he'll cash @SAK Yalcin? :)|pg||
nt|atabey: but this very hard |pg||
nt|paulg:  Piper is easily the best declarer in the Scotland team ... practice makes perfect|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Haha|pg||
nt|capercliff: im not sure he can get this right, is there a case to playing the double @d finesse instead of low to the J?|pg||
nt|hedyg: was there a case to play @c?|pg||
nt|hedyg: i thought that was risky|pg||
nt|hedyg: he needs the @ds for his contract|pg||
nt|capercliff: i dont think the defence can stop 9 tricks as it happens|pg||
nt|rodvenn: Hofta realised he could not beat the contract|pg||
nt|snetram:  ma jeszcze czas przez dwie lewy|pg||
pc|s4|nt|brolucius: I checked the instructions on my various packets of heart pills and they made no mention of taking an extra dose before England world cup matches.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if N has stiff heart ace, that line would make|pg||
nt|bagman: Now declarer has no time to get that long heart|pg||
pc|h4|nt|fabsayc: or|pg||
nt|jillan:  board 9 will give 10 to Sweden|pg||
pc|dK|pg||
nt|bagman: This is still likely to make: often defense might set up 6th trick in trumps but here declarer has the spots |pg||
nt|brolucius: As often happens, the Italians used 10 bids where the Slovakians thought that 4 were enough. Once in a while, the longer auction would diagnose a good slam, so the extra work can ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: pay off.|pg||
nt|hedyg: so he could have played J@d, then a @s to the 8|pg||
nt|stc: What is the %play in trump here ? I think small to the 9 sligthly better|pg||
nt|brolucius: Iain makes a good point about 11-14 being too large a range to cover accurately.|pg||
nt|Gerben42: at least 3@S wouldnt have been let through here either :)|pg||
nt|babs59: interesting - with no @D at trick 2, North would play the @C the other way, for safety|pg||
pc|s2|nt|bjacobs: The winning contract was probably 1NT.  It could be reached if, for example, West opens 1NT|pg||
nt|bagman: anyhow a flat 450, wasn't it|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I was told 11, but corrected to 10 now|pg||
nt|bagman: ok|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok ty Bas|pg||
nt|paulg:  excellent defence that will set up the spade trick as the seventh defensive trick|pg||
pc|sT|nt|Vugraphznk: Lauria is pretty disgruntled. Has been like that since the 3NTX|pg||
nt|peachy: an overtrick IMP for Bulgaria here|pg||
pc|sA|nt|atabey: wd|pg||

pc|s6|pg||
nt|hedyg: see? instincts!|pg||

nt|hedyg: V/L play 1@s as 10-21 and Versace did NOT open!|pg||
nt|cicus: spades must come in anyway if you lose a trump so best seems a small trump to the 10|pg||

nt|andyv:  yes... we were trying to remember when last time Italy lost back to back matches|pg||
nt|petergill: 6@C, 6@S and 6NT are all playable, but how can North know that South has @C9, or South know that North has @C10? Too tough.|pg||

nt|atabey: the way to 4@h was also ugly :)|pg||

nt|toral5: ok.tnk u bas|pg||
nt|Walddk2: A delicate 3NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Could well depend on how you tackle hearts|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Even I would probably not overcall 2@C here :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: At favourable vul, I think few would agree|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Hi Carl|pg||
nt|yuval10: after 3@h there's no chance W won't add|pg||
nt|yuval10: probably 4@c by him, if S doesn't bid it|pg||
nt|haans: OR passed by E|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: The women's competition is still very tight!|pg||
nt|yuval10: perhaps 4@d is S bids 4@c|pg||

nt|peachy: other room didn't support hearts right away, and then did not bid 4H after opener re-opened|pg||
nt|peachy: I like the direct 3H by E|pg||
nt|haans: dont we all NOW?|pg||
nt|haans: only non vul game|pg||
nt|peachy: stretch to support partner, opener is not expecting the world from 3H|pg||
nt|yuval10: only if W won't overbid....|pg||
nt|yuval10: if S bids 5@c for instance, quite easy to see W bids on|pg||
nt|haans: yep but S wont dare|pg||
nt|toral5: why easy viren?u expect kx to drop in 7-1 fits?|pg||
mb|2C|nt|paulg:  at adverse vulnerability and a spade void, i'd be very nervous opening a strong 1@c|pg||
nt|paulg:  what level will the bidding be at when it gets back to me?|pg||
nt|toral5: finally a grand coming up|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North read that last hand well|pg||
nt|viren169: South should have led a normal spade in the 1st place!|pg||
mb|d|nt|brgpro: seems it showed @s |pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 27 and 26 IMPs difference is 1 VP too btw Andy :)|pg||

nt|andy_h: 2@D is "trash multi", which is like a weak 2 except the strength is 2-7 and can be a 5 card suit|pg||
nt|xenya: deaja vu of sorts -- if NS bid 6@H or 6N, they will make it|pg||
nt|jbgood: Brogeland is in 6 hearts in the OR|pg||
nt|andy_h: This will allow 2M openings to be 8-11 which can be destructive and constructive in nature.  If you have ever come across those 6M with 10hcp that doesn't deem worthy of a 1M or a ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: 2M opening, then having the 2M=8-11 really helps|pg||
nt|rodvenn: qj of spades maybe a worry for Bocchi|pg||
nt|xenya: but 6@C will be problematic|pg||
nt|sharkey: For those who want to study Lohay-Henc system you find it here : http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/May/OpenTeams/slovakia/henc-lohay.pdf|pg||
nt|brolucius: Hedy has to allow time for a restaurant lunch before the Portugal-Brazil game. |pg||
nt|bagman: Nothing works for EW on this hand. Luckily they are nv|pg||
nt|sybarra: quite a lead directing over call!|pg||
nt|petergill: It looks simple to do this, but it is not|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@D Precision, 11-15|pg||
nt|athene: well, you might just bash out @HAK and then hope to ruff spades down with the diamond as entry|pg||
nt|athene: it perhaps depends whether you get a club or diamond lead|pg||
nt|hedyg: in the mean time Hungary is in 12th position|pg||
nt|gulyas: thats what I thought|pg||
nt|cicus: but the entry is important only if spades are 3-3 with Q offside|pg||
nt|andyv:  this one still has a lot of boards|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but in this type of event you treat it as one long match, since the objective is qualification|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: ciekawe, ¿e w otwartym Szwed nie zagra³ na wygranie gry tylko pokornie siê podda³ i zarobi³ 2 impy|pg||
nt|koksoy: 6@H  -1   is  my  guess...  |pg||
nt|bagman: N has good enough hand to bid 4NT or more for take out and then correct @C to diamonds|pg||
nt|paulg:  according to the CC, double is takeout emphasising the majors|pg||
nt|babs59: today has been our coldest (possibly South Australia's wettest) day of the year|pg||
nt|schtsch: he will bid it as 14-16|pg||
nt|rv: I presume we should ignore scores in brds 12 and 13, passed out doesn't make sense|pg||
nt|athene: versace going to follow up with 4nt over 4@S perhaps? i think with that suit disparity you want to insist on clubs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The defence can set it by force but they probably won't if North is declarer|pg||
nt|jillan:  I would.... and I m not a jr, just passed.....|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I'd prefer to bid 1@S and @H later|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: what a lovely hand W|pg||
mb|p|nt|jkotor: mo¿e wist z dubla karo nie by³ mo¿liwy?|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: (14)15-17 NT|pg||
nt|andyv:  W bid 3@S here and N dbld in OR|pg||
nt|andyv:  it can be expensive that one VP|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 3@S could be called enterprising, even NV vs V|pg||
nt|bagman: West has no defense and no distributional surprises|pg||
nt|andyv:  well within the Versace playbook:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: lol|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe it meant colors |pg||
nt|marlowepi: perhaps W pulled wrong card, meaning to bid 1H|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I'd love to play with Marc Smith in that case lol|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 6@H seems reasonable|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 3NT solid @D with too much on the side?|pg||
nt|petergill: 3NT = solid @D's and close to 15 points|pg||
nt|athene: yes, that's quite a small factor|pg||
nt|koksoy: as  both  red  suits divided 4-0  I think  he  can  not  make  slem|pg||
nt|bagman: With both reds breaking as they are, 5@H is the limit|pg||
nt|koksoy: 3 @H   --  5nt  ??|pg||
nt|bagman: They surely bid slam, though|pg||
nt|paulg:  may gain 3 imps even if you go down in 6@h|pg||
nt|paulg:  there will be a few 7@h on the scoresheet|pg||
nt|koksoy: may  be..|pg||
nt|bagman: Declare might make 6@H X against careless defense|pg||
nt|paulg:  Denning may splinter in clubs here|pg||
nt|bagman: N wins the black lead and plays @HJ not covered|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 6H is good defence against 6C|pg||
nt|koksoy: 5 nt  is an old  conventition called  Josephine which asks partner about trump  quality  for  garandslem|pg||
nt|bagman: True, but EW have to find that suit first|pg||
nt|petergill: NS's 1NT is 14-16, so the 1NT rebid was 11-13 (or a very good 10)|pg||
nt|ziff:  Probably|pg||
nt|rnmalik: wow a grand.|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Tarzan Precision at work|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: seniorsi na 4, Bialoglowy na 6 miejscu|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It is a delicate 3NT, although no amount of delicacy would help if a diamond is led|pg||
nt|Walddk2: East can't find that|pg||
nt|bjacobs: East is not yet on lead|pg||
nt|bjacobs: However, I don't think West would lead one either|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No, but he might be after double|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Evil position for Madala|pg||
nt|jillan:  not an easy decision for S here|pg||
nt|bjacobs: A double is somewhat of a blame-transfer bid|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Does that you mean that you think Swedes are evil when they have put him in that position?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: lol|pg||
nt|jillan:  and rightly so!  :)|pg||
nt|bjacobs: This is why the 2@C bid is mandatory|pg||
nt|jillan:  evil is good....|pg||
nt|jillan:  When I'm good, I'm very good. When I'm bad, I'm better (Mae West)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Must have been a bridge player with that surname|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Can they even beat 3@S?|pg||
nt|jillan:  shoudl be a BUT when I am bad.... there|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I have a "no" and a "yes" so far (to beating 3@S)|pg||
nt|haans: :( :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Again 2NT to show a weak hand. Partner is expected to rebid 3@C on most shapes. A direct 3@C would have been stronger.|pg||
nt|andyv:  that's why 4 person teams rarely win... just too much bridge over a short period of time.|pg||
nt|jkotor: chyba Adam móg³ o¿ywiæ 2@h "z bilansu sto³u"|pg||
nt|yuval10: i guess he thinks otherwise....|pg||
nt|toral5: tht was a long story already over|pg||
nt|viren169: No but not unreasonable to play for Kx onside |pg||
pc|c5|nt|bagman: Against good opponents 3@S might help them more than hurt them|pg||
nt|rodvenn: 6@h is easier. then declarer can investigate the distribution|pg||
nt|xenya: same in 6N|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: jak prosisz Irlandczyków Antoni to po angielsku|pg||
nt|sybarra: or is it transfer to hts?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I can see a TD call coming here|pg||
nt|Gerben42: define "too much" pd hasnt promised much|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Too much for a gambling 3NT|pg||
nt|Gerben42: gives Romanovski a tough decision|pg||
nt|petergill: Janis Romanovski realised that his void in partner's suit was terrible for higher contracts - well done|pg||
nt|athene: it's a good advertisement for a) not leading a singleton trump and b) not leading a trump against a small slam|pg||
nt|gulyas: they do have all the controls in the pack|pg||
nt|athene: but i doubt north is going to lead a heart :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: all like 3@H?|pg||
nt|hedyg: i prefer 3NT|pg||
nt|gulyas: its a nice suit|pg||
nt|cicus: I do|pg||
nt|hedyg: is it?|pg||
nt|gulyas: but I can see 3NT as well|pg||
nt|hedyg: the problem is that pd does not have AK@C!|pg||
nt|athene: whether 3@H is a nice suit will depend on how declarer plays it :)|pg||
nt|gulyas: all the controls show towards a suit contract|pg||
nt|hedyg: so you show that|pg||
nt|hedyg: he is imposing @hs and the suit just isnt good enough for that|pg||
nt|cicus: E has a problem here, he would like to invite to 6@H|pg||
nt|schtsch: spade?|pg||
nt|schtsch: what happened to fourth best nowadays?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Interesting that Bocchi didn't overcall 1@H as 1@D promises 0@D|pg||
nt|wstuart: Bad Madala - no Madala bicuit tonight  lol|pg||
nt|toral5: 4 match pointers 7nt:)|pg||
nt|haans: at last some action|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Action Doubles :)|pg||
nt|toral5: this is a telephone number|pg||
pc|c2|nt|jtr: Well, maybe West is prepared to play 4@h facing @hs?|pg||
nt|andyv:  and here it did help them in the OR to get to a thin game|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Landy over opponent's 1NT overcall :)|pg||
nt|mbruun: Trump lead is best for the defense. |pg||
nt|barnets: 6@H would have been better to spectate|pg||
nt|petergill: Entries are a bit awkward|pg||
nt|petergill: in 3NT|pg||
nt|Gerben42: too few high cards missing to really be in trouble though|pg||
nt|barnets: no he has 3@S 4@H a club and a few diamonds|pg||
nt|gulyas: with 12hcp, E may bid more than just 4@H|pg||
nt|lesniak: oczywiscie mozna bylo impasowac pika co jest dobre jak N ma wszystkie 4 piki(5%) ale to by bylo zle gdyby S mial 5 kar i choc 1 figure pik- tez iok 5 %|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Versace had a tough time passing there|pg||
nt|ziff:  Probably too tough, that is|pg||
nt|athene: ok, he goes quietly|pg||
nt|yuval10: @c lead?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Commentator's curse strikes again|pg||
nt|haans: me guess 2|pg||
pc|cA|nt|hedyg: Piper loves to bid NT|pg||
nt|paulg:  i think you mean 'Piper loves to bid and play'|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Maybe not|pg||
nt|hedyg: well he cannot bid NT for sure|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@s rkc in @H?|pg||
nt|cicus: the dreaded 4@S ace ask|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 4@S must be KC asking|pg||
nt|gulyas: yes|pg||
nt|bagman: As Philippe pointed out, EW can make 6@C|pg||
nt|toral5: frm d score point of view,it ll b bad 4 d dutch.cos stil they trail EVEN if 7 is bid.|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Nowadays most people know where the name comes from, but does anyone want to try?|pg||
nt|jillan:  she is also the one who said: There are only two things to do on a rainy afternoon, and I do not play bBridge|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In the last round today we have Italy v Poland, 1st against 2nd. That should be a thriller|pg||
nt|yuval10: no, he found the best lead|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|daman: this looks like -1 to me|pg||
nt|daman: 3@Ds   2@Ss and a @H|pg||
nt|athene: slightly unusual that lauria-versace passed 2@D out|pg||
nt|athene: many pairs would be in a forcing situation after doubling a 1nt overcall|pg||
nt|daman: what do you think of a double of 2@D by South?|pg||
nt|athene: it's not the same as doubling a 1nt opener (even assuming you play that as strong) because here you know your side has the balance of the points|pg||
nt|athene: i assume NS play double as takeout and north didn't fancy it with such a threadbare hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 7/12 atm Paul|pg||
nt|hedyg: my version looked politer :)|pg||
nt|petergill: The play will be interesting, I think|pg||
nt|schtsch: of course, 1nt asks for passive lead|pg||
nt|rnmalik: We know how the cards are placed but who would risk. |pg||
nt|lechcold: mo¿e, ale popatrz jakie mia³ "wartoci" w m³odszych|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Well Madala will have little difficult I feel|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The @HA will beat thin air, and the diamonds won't be runnable|pg||
pc|c6|nt|Walddk4: Top spot when you have a heart loser|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Losing one trick in each suit|pg||
nt|brolucius: This would normally rate as an OK game, but East's 1NT overcall means that there will be a trump loser.|pg||
nt|iceblue: 2NT is LEB, xfers to 3@C|pg||
nt|brolucius: The re-opening double gives North at least three options (clubs, NT or penalty pass).|pg||
nt|brgpro: on @s lead, N has to go up the 10 to make this|pg||
nt|jtr: I hate giving my partner options:)|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is what lazy bidding-panel members describe as a 'flexible action'. (All readers groan immediately).|pg||
nt|bagman: After 3@S it's not possible for NS to stay in 3@C and they might have to bid game as N has enough to act|pg||
nt|bagman: If North is going to lead a heart against 3NT, he should lead a low|pg||
nt|brolucius: If they use ten bids this time too, they will surely get too high.|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Okay, maybe not 2-way... lol|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He suggested that he and I have a game soon. Maybe I should accept|pg||
nt|bagman: and they have actually the highest making contract|pg||
nt|koksoy: Nederlands-Slovakya  2-0|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: The last week has been really pleasurable here, but for two days (one of which is today) where it was overcast|pg||
nt|rv: 2@d seems to be artificial GF here|pg||
nt|cumino: 6NT here. There is squeeze in M but double squeeze position had worked if south had 3@H|pg||
nt|drorp: chose the wrong time to suddenly being conservative, this time a save would work quite well (only 2 off by double finnesing the diamond)|pg||
nt|athene: maybe versace hoping his partner has a strong hand with a spade trick|pg||
nt|toral5: so lot of hard work in last 7 brds|pg||
nt|toral5: 1nt is BETA here?|pg||
nt|peachy: Well, opener did expect the world afterall, competitive decisions are seldom easy|pg||
pc|c8|nt|pasker: Lauria is probably giving a choice between 3NT and 4@S|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 1@D did show @H apparently|pg||
nt|brolucius: If any kibitzers are thinking of logging off, to enjoy the sunshine, I am told that they will miss one of the most spectacular distributional hands of all time, later in this set.|pg||
nt|paulg:  3@d was no doubt intended as a good raise, but the diamond raise makes it sound less like one|pg||
nt|ziff:  Hand doesn t lie very well for declarer. Control may become a problem|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|Walddk4: Top spot for N-S that is, 4@C for E-W|pg||
nt|othered1: Or maybe not. Concention card says what Hedy describes in 1N box, but 1@C box says it shows outside of NT range (11-13).  So which is it?|pg||
nt|bagman: A low heart can give declarer a problem|pg||
nt|gulyas: 0-3|pg||
nt|gulyas: @HQ?|pg||
nt|hedyg: now asking about Q@H|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i am not quite sure what 3@H showed, anybody know?|pg||
nt|toral5: control asking i mean?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I guess de Wijs is de master, but then what's 3@S instead of 3@H|pg||
nt|toral5: so 1@S showed some number of @H?|pg||
nt|jillan:  he has 4@C tricks 2@S tricks and will get 3@H tricks|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|antoniz: nie jestem trójjêzyczny jak Ty-angielski , niemiecki i wspania³y polski:):)|pg||
nt|andyv:  @c lead when pd didn't dbl 2@c makes little sense since it's from shortness|pg||
nt|rv: 4n is quantitative from West w/o any agreed fit, possibly showing 18-19, East correctly declined with only 13 hcp and would have accepted with 14/15|pg||
nt|rv: East also knows West is short in @d with 4-4-1-4 and slam doesn't rate to play well with no source of tricks|pg||
nt|viren169: 800|pg||
nt|viren169: 0800 number|pg||
nt|toral5: so contract is 2nt dbl aftr trick 4:)|pg||
pc|cK|nt|jtr: @d lead also gives the vital entry|pg||
nt|brgpro: and he will play @cA and @c i think|pg||
nt|brolucius: In case East or West has @CK-x-x.|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3NT+2 at the other table, I am told.|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: Are you slandering my intel?! :P|pg||
nt|daman: not so sure that was best|pg||
nt|antoniz: piêkne odejcie|pg||
nt|mamos: dont understand much about this hand|pg||
nt|brolucius: It will be nice to say: 'Well, yes, we did lose to Germany in the World Cup, but - against that - I enjoyed that big hand on BBO this morning.'|pg||
nt|Walddk2: England supporters are kindly requested not to have a look at the scoreline in the match against the Netherlands|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Half full glasses are better than the half empty ones|pg||
nt|stc: The problem here is if @c are 4-4 or not|pg||
nt|brolucius: Full glasses even better.|pg||
nt|cicus: 4@S gains in 1 out of 1000 and causes trouble on every 2nd hand|pg||
nt|gulyas: what do you mean?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: This makes sense because else 4@S by responder would be a @S cue and the strong hand would ask Aces, which doesn't make sense|pg||
nt|paulg:  I hate auctions where there is some doubt over the trump suit .. surely Denning would cue bid 5@c if he was certain about hearts?|pg||
nt|koksoy: what  is  1@C  double ??  can  it  be  majors ??|pg||
nt|lechcold: najgorsze z mo¿liwych chyba|pg||
nt|athene: 3@C natural and constructive, but Duboin isn't interested - a little cautious with a decent 8-count, perhaps|pg||
pc|c9|nt|bagman: with the relays going on N had no information where EW were going. So the X was ok|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://tinyurl.com/ebc-open-b   http://tinyurl.com/ebc-open-a   http://tinyurl.com/3yl8spu  for running Euro scores |pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer has entry problems|pg||
nt|skorchev: after the group stage they'll play less rounds per they (most often 2 rounds), so it isn't impossible to play 4-handed|pg||
nt|andyv:  I always admire auctions like this one where EW were not satisfied in just bidding 4@s but exhausted all possibilities for a slam.|pg||
nt|tokay1975: lorenzo  donot like 3cl but still  he will try with a monster|pg||
nt|toral5: 3@C seemd to be discouraging for lauria|pg||
nt|toral5: 3@C=NO 4@S with @C cards?|pg||
nt|rhelle: the explanation is that 3@c denies 4@s. That explains 3@d as a further try|pg||
nt|tokay1975: yes club values and deniþes 4sp|pg||
pc|h3|nt|brolucius: I am told: 2@h=4@h or max w/o 4M  2@s = relay 3@c = 4@h/4m min. 3@d = asks minor 3@h = 4@c|pg||
nt|cicus: I hate 4@S ace ask for @Hs|pg||
nt|hedyg: pulling the brakes|pg||
nt|gulyas: I love it|pg||
nt|hedyg: why Gabor?|pg||
nt|hedyg: i love it too|pg||
nt|cicus: see above|pg||
nt|athene: i agree these tweaks to improve blackwood cause much more trouble than they save - it's like the difference betwenen 3014 and 1430|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Why Gabor?|pg||
nt|gulyas: he passes them too often:)|pg||
nt|petergill: The 3 declarers in Group B who have played 4@S so far have made it, with the clubs coming in. |pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Jan Jansma tells me 3@S is a strong relay whereas 3@H is a weak relay|pg||
nt|ppiglett: 3C not natural. With declarer showing his shape I suggest a diamond lead|pg||
nt|toral5: ok|pg||
nt|rhelle: otherwise you'd give up on slam and simply bid 4@d, I expect|pg||
nt|rhelle: 4@h, sorry|pg||
nt|robinswr: its much better for east to show nothing and just allow west to describe his hand|pg||
nt|toral5: how shall he play this?|pg||
nt|toral5: @D king and @C king?|pg||
nt|robinswr: needs to play trumps from dummy|pg||
nt|jillan:  see....|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Piece of cake now, but even without it when East has shown the majors|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Then he can advance the king from dummy. Does not matter if West wins the singleton ace. He has a marked finesse later|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Even the @DJ here won't fool Madala - he will know that East has an honour|pg||
nt|milton_se: that's why I agree w Jill about the 2C bid ...|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Presumably if all you guys are passing on East's actual hand, you also pass with QJ9xx-10xxxx-Jx-x|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Exactly|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That 2@C bid gave the show away|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I'm stubbornly with Bertheau.  Wonder how at many tables East will pass over 1@C|pg||
nt|Walddk2: You know it's not your hand, why tell the opponents how they should play it?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Thank you Roland :) I guess this is a recurring debate :)|pg||
nt|milton_se: and no disturbing effect at all -- just gives them an extra bid|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Surrender, Bill|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Never|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: lol|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I will fight you on the beaches, and elsewhere |pg||
nt|bjacobs: (since you are now in London ...)|pg||
nt|jillan:  and I will support your right to do so  :)|pg||
nt|milton_se: yeah, your beaches are safely far from here :)|pg||

nt|hedyg: you just stick to your agreements|pg||

pc|s3|nt|pasker: not any more it seems|pg||
pc|sA|nt|hedyg: N had a clear 2@d bid and 2NT over 2@s by S|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: Third hand NV vs V it's different, I suppose|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer taking safety play in trumps|pg||

nt|viren169: due to the 7 of clubs|pg||
pc|hA|nt|brolucius: 2@H is about 8-10 and he could downgrade such as @CQ-J doubleton. I don't think it is a bad response. |pg||
nt|hedyg: you know pd will not bid game with 14 opposite 2@H|pg||
nt|stc: he didn't make yet|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: Zivkovic left for the bathroom|pg||
nt|hedyg: strange pass by Versace this hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: would you pass?|pg||
nt|iain sime: Despite the opening lead accidents in the other room, Italy are building a substantial lead.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Perhaps 2NT is a better response (to a double of 1@D) than 2@H was. On the previous board. Those queens and jacks may play OK in NT.|pg||
nt|hedyg: how can one not bid ever with the W hand?|pg||

nt|gulyas: I think you should play a simpler game, cicus:) you get excited too often over simple conventions|pg||

nt|mdgraham: hi Andy|pg||
nt|yuval10: 3NT was dangerous but luckily A@d was with E|pg||
nt|yuval10: 4@s can go down with @c lead as well|pg||
nt|haans: suppose support double modern style|pg||
nt|viren169: 4@H is probably better with 5 trumps and shape|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk5: Maybe 5422 is to bad|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Bas|pg||
nt|bagman: They might play 16-18|pg||
nt|mamos: i dont think that on the last hand it had anything to do with luck   or on some of the others|pg||
nt|bagman: With @CQ dropping and diamonds running with one lead from dummy and good guess a game makes|pg||
nt|toral5: muller wont make a move wid those 5c cards|pg||
nt|toral5: aftr hearing 2@S|pg||
nt|toral5: nice detailed explaination of 1nt:)|pg||
nt|sharkey: hi Andy|pg||
nt|tokay1975: throw in play also makes if  queen of hearts  dblton when cl ace is off|pg||
mb|6S|nt|capercliff: a @c lead was needed to beat 6|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@d= 5+@hs 4-18|pg||
nt|rodvenn: 2@c may be Drury or natural|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: That's true for any contract on any board, bridge is a 100% no luck game|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Contract bridge that is|pg||
nt|mamos: well  we might have forgiven Colin for doubling this one opposite a vul first in hand opener from part|pg||
nt|mamos: but then he has played with David a lot|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the NT games on 8 & 9 were a bit unlucky. the two subsequent ones were just bad contracts, even if one would rate to reach them|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i would say it is a better double than the one he actually did perpetrate|pg||
nt|skorchev: 1@D=11-17 hcp, 4+@D, unbal|pg||
nt|skorchev: 2NT = very weak or FG @D fit (tnx Rado)|pg||
nt|andyv:  this one should not be successful|pg||
nt|april7: E might end up here in an unmakable 3NT contract, but with 1NT answer by W if its not forcing might pass,otherwise they will reach 3NT|pg||
nt|athene: 2@D showed 8+ hcp, forcing to game if opener has the strong hand|pg||
nt|athene: i am told 3@C showed 4@S-5@H|pg||
nt|athene: south might have doubled 2@C there but it's a bit aggressive i guess|pg||
nt|ppiglett: as was suggested By guido Ferraro on Vugraph in Ostende, a high scoring match in Football is a potential sign of quality. Howvere the oposite applies in Bridge. 13-7 after 13 ...|pg||
nt|ppiglett: boards is good bridge|pg||
nt|toral5: 1@H is discouraging for east as finesses are LIKELY 2 fail|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: Only lead not give away anything|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: lol|pg||
nt|capercliff: easily enough from the West hand|pg||
nt|paulg:  2@d is either a weak two in hearts or 5+@H with 18+ points|pg||
nt|sharkey: Surprised W didnt bid his @S suit OR|pg||
nt|brolucius: On a similar hand yesterday, David Greenwood was saying that he prefers a 1NT rebid on that East type. It seems to be a close decision between 1NT and 2@D, but I rather like 1NT.|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@H Precision 11-15|pg||
nt|fabsayc: this time they have stretched the odds|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: N explained it as just weak with @D|pg||
nt|rv: I expect Catalina to make it here|pg||
nt|toral5: so few more 4 iceland|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: Declarer is going to guess the trumps|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: That might be true, I'm being told no, nor the 2@C opening which would be 18-19 BAL|pg||
nt|bagman: because he can pick Qxxx from W but not from E unless he takes a direct finesse|pg||
nt|bagman: With the diamond lead it is possible that declarer plays spades from the top and relies on @C or @H|pg||
nt|iain sime: No, I would have bid 3@S. But two doubletons and an AK to lead and that is enough.|pg||
nt|andyv:  he certainly has that|pg||
nt|athene: north could have bid 2@H over 1@S perhaps|pg||
nt|tokay1975: that play was more  spectacular but  to get600  is more important for norberto|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: The live score service seems still down  Teething problems i guess|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 5-0 would be evil. 4-1 is just poor|pg||
nt|mbruun: OK|pg||
nt|brolucius: West would have passed 1NT, as it happens, and they would have stayed at a more comfortable level.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Welcome to Giorgio Mauri|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Hello everyone from Italy|pg||
nt|andyv:  with 10 and 2 9s almost too strong|pg||
nt|mamos: does declarer need to lead @hK to make this|pg||
nt|hedyg: surely that is intended as a joke|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: lol|pg||
nt|andyv:  what they lack in strength, they make up in numbers:)|pg||

nt|kiwibridge: oops man overboard throw him a raft|pg||
pc|h2|nt|hedyg: 2@c= gazzilli like|pg||
nt|jbgood: i think that is the only explanation - 2 @c shows 3 card Major support and 8 +(and never clubs)|pg||
nt|jbgood: if clubs, 2 NT is a transfer to that suit|pg||
nt|andy_h: One benefit of playing this is that you don't need another route to show a 3 card limit raise, but the downside of it is that it can hurt the tempo of your 2/1 auctions if it ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: happens to be a GF|pg||
nt|hedyg: now 5@c by S?|pg||
nt|hedyg: he really wants to protect the K@s|pg||
nt|stc: 800 available but hard to collect|pg||
nt|iain sime: 5@D ?|pg||
nt|hedyg: useless K@S...|pg||
nt|skorchev: yes, since he is passed hand, the GF option is hardly possible|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: What would 3@D and 4|pg||
nt|ziff:  12 boards in 75 minutes is pretty fast|pg||
nt|petergill: Versace has shown 5+ @S and |pg||
nt|petergill: 4+ @d and 3 cards in @H and |pg||
nt|petergill: 3 cards in @S I mean|pg||
nt|drorp: this is a very bad double|pg||
nt|rhelle: you mean that both sides are making the same mistakes :)|pg||
nt|ppiglett: That would be untrue!!!!|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Madala making a really strong invite here, but Bocchi feels sick|pg||
pc|h7|nt|brolucius: South can place declarer with a double stopper in clubs and is considering if he can cast his net elsewhere.|pg||

nt|bagman: Now @SA, @C AK JT (@H discard), !JD and then heart finesse when in dummyt|pg||
nt|paulg:  GIB can take the heart finesse when the @dJ is ducked, as it can still play the diamonds for four tricks|pg||
nt|paulg:  More realistically, declarer will not be happy (yet)|pg||
nt|koksoy: but  in  practice  he  will play  clubs first  then diamond jack..  then try  for  dropping @D9  .. if  not try  for  heart finesse  for  the  9th  trick|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer probably plays AK of clubs|pg||
nt|paulg:  doubleton @cQ is about the only option to make it|pg||
nt|rv: sry Caterina, on @d lead, right play is to cash @SA before entering dummy with @HK and take @c hook even if @S honor doesn't fall|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Undo please|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Coffee...|pg||
nt|atabey: undo again pls|pg||
nt|drorp: not declerer will know how to play the diamonds, but since he lacks entries it might not help him|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|atabey: for the turkish spectators: our women team is up 46-1 for now. I thk against the chech republic|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@c= good hand @S+@C|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I believe England lost a swing to Ireland last night when trumps broke 5-0 in a 6@C contract   |pg||
nt|brolucius: South must look for a card to suggest a diamond switch.|pg||
nt|bagman: He needs the doubleton @CQ |pg||
nt|petergill: in @S|pg||
nt|petergill: Pardon me, I am tired, it is late here|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: np Peter :)|pg||
nt|athene: north is wondering whether to return a diamond, i suppose, but i don't think that can gain very often|pg||
nt|athene: you need partner to have the @CA for a start|pg||
pc|h5|nt|othered1: Tis is pushy, but good @H spots and other good views may pull this through|pg||
nt|hedyg: only 2@H tricks|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@ds, 4@cs on a good guess|pg||
nt|hedyg: that is only 8|pg||
nt|bagman: In isolation the spade play should be @SK and then finesse(s)|pg||
nt|mbruun: Yes I remember not a sound overcall with a boring 5332 and a bad suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Silence was golden for Muller in the other room|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He passed in a flash|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In order not to risk further penalties|pg||
nt|rv: win @HA and cash @SA now|pg||
nt|yuval10: so, same lead, will it be the same play?|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|marlowepi: as S has no 4th D, E is in control|pg||
nt|hedyg: if i would bid 2NT opps would take the 1st 5 @ss|pg||
nt|gulyas: I like the way this match goes - some pushes, some doubledigit swings to Hungary, some more pushes:)|pg||
nt|athene: well i suppose the same contract will be reached in the other room|pg||
nt|athene: with 15 hcp facing 10, all suits covered, and no great fit anywhere|pg||
nt|viren169: 2@C dbled making!|pg||
nt|viren169: on the last|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the contract was the same, except the other S made 2@CX sacre blue|pg||
nt|toral5: ouch..tht defense is worth seeing|pg||
nt|viren169: Gunnar is good... but not that good!|pg||
pc|dA|nt|snetram:  remis|pg||
nt|hedyg: no entry to dummy|pg||
nt|stc: yes but if they play twice @c and @h S is endplay after the @d ruff|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes.|pg||
nt|skorchev: 3@D would be to play and 4@D some kind of invite, I guess|pg||
nt|andyv:  3|pg||
pc|d5|nt|hedyg: OR same 3NT|pg||
nt|bagman: There are some chances for a 2nd trump trick for S|pg||
nt|frululu: and wd|pg||
nt|robinswr: with a singleton east should bid in balancing position but my guess is that he can't show minors|pg||
pc|d2|nt|Walddk2: NL and Russia lost 3VPs each yesterday for slow play|pg||
nt|bagman: With the setting trick in his hand S might have considered cashing it but there's really no way that the @HA can run away|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Vanuzzi has taken a bathroom break|pg||
nt|babs59: Italy gained again when North treated her red 5/5 as a multi 2|pg||
nt|babs59: so they played in 3@D rather than 3NT|pg||
nt|babs59: sensible treatment when you have multis - the singleton @SQ downgrades|pg||
nt|rv: well played|pg||
nt|jillan:  I am a girl, and I can see all 4 hands, so would only bid 2@S.... :)|pg||
nt|haans: now easy play in @D|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|mamos: what if South had won Ace and played Diamond?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: lol Daniel|pg||
nt|athene: i guess 2NT is showing a good diamond suit  because 1@D can't have more than 17 points|pg||
nt|hedyg: try to sound impartial Daniel :)|pg||
nt|gulyas: sry, I hope u understand I root for my team|pg||

nt|athene: i think there is a case for opening that east hand 1nt, if you play 15-17|pg||
nt|athene: you are really stuck for a rebid if you open 1@H and partner bids 1NT|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Top 6 + the Netherlands qualify for the Bermuda Bowl next year. If NL are among the 6, seventh also qualifies|pg||
nt|april7: why not pass a passable bid|pg||
nt|athene: Lauria could definitely have passed 3@DX i think|pg||
nt|athene: he has pretty decent diamond support for a man who has shown 9 cards in the majors|pg||
nt|atabey: 3@d X was a good spot. what made lauria run from it?|pg||
nt|atabey: ok. I am told that 3@d was a relay. not natural|pg||
pc|d4|nt|hedyg: same lead|pg||
nt|atabey: confirmed by the audiance. turkey 46 czech republic 1. for now. ladies match|pg||
nt|brolucius: Important to pick up every available trick in defence when opponents have 650 in the bag already.|pg||
pc|dT|nt|Vugraphznk: I am sorry, I lost play here, I'll claim the correct amount of tricks|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok|pg||
nt|hedyg: did Zorlu play another @d?|pg||

nt|hedyg: ok ty|pg||
nt|atabey: then its -1|pg||
nt|atabey: at least -1 I mean|pg||
nt|atabey: still a small swing for italy|pg||
nt|hedyg: Kandemir misguessed the @c and Madala switched to ..............10@s!|pg||
nt|othered1: Defense in other room was merciless after declarer misguessed @C|pg||
nt|andy_h: So, E-W seem to have handled the interference well as one generally needs to be prepared if you play any type of relay sequences|pg||
nt|xenya: it would be interesting to see 2@DXX -- but with S's diamond holding the chances of that are almost non-existent |pg||
nt|rodvenn: Brogeland played 3 times diamonds. Which must be the right defense|pg||
nt|wstuart: good def|pg||

nt|athene: so 3nt just showed 4-5-2-2 maybe|pg||
nt|atabey: this will go some down. its a matter of time only. can we assume how many down?|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|capercliff: well done:)|pg||
nt|bagman: South tries for 2 down|pg||
pc|s6|nt|brolucius: N/S play reverse count signals, so Bocchi has shown two hearts.|pg||
nt|brgpro: he has to duck again to give himself a chance although declarer can play @s and make this anyways|pg||
nt|andyv:  3@d probably invite... who knows what 4@d would be|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@H showed 3 spades (not 4) and not 4@D|pg||
nt|bjacobs: South's hand is pretty massive to just bid 2@S ... he can hope for a stiff club opposite|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: Although we saw a pretty good translation of the Lithuanian system notes earlier this week :)|pg||

nt|athene: i think any modern player should be able to say "sorry, partner" in any language|pg||
nt|skorchev: double @H finesse is his best chance - 25% .... he could slightly improve drawing @SAK wating for @SQJ doubleton, but then he would be short of entries to finesse @HS twice|pg||

mb|p|nt|hedyg: take away his bidding box?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Yes, when the opps generally play slower than you it can be a pretty powerful weapon|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: It takes a lot of experience (which EW obviously have) to keep your own pace|pg||
nt|rodvenn: Madala seem not to be up to the standard of Brogeland yet. But he is young|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 25 I think|pg||
nt|bagman: I have no idea if it makes but let's see if EW bid it|pg||
nt|bogier: sytuacja nie jest taka prosta|pg||
nt|andyv:  NS can make 3@h|pg||
nt|pasker: S may have been tempted to open the bidding holding 2 aces and a king|pg||
nt|andyv:  S needs to get in the bidding|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1Nt isn't forcing|pg||
nt|sybarra: 2 @D multi,  wk 2 in a major |pg||
nt|barnets: easy for south to play a heart to satop any endplay|pg||
nt|athene: it's something you might need at any moment :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: rehi all. small hiccup there|pg||
nt|petergill: Dbl by the passed hand suggests both majors|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: 1@H - 1@S - 2@D passed out rather inelegant|pg||
nt|rv: traditionalists will pass with South hand, very few will pass in today's bridge|pg||
nt|athene: 5@S isn't the most forward-going bid lauria could have made|pg||
nt|athene: so versace might let this go|pg||
nt|drorp: i think it's more than enough with his hand|pg||
nt|drorp: Versace has a decision to make|pg||
nt|drorp: 6@S isn't that good|pg||
nt|athene: hard to bid slam with nineteen plain-suit losers|pg||
nt|drorp: just works here|pg||
nt|athene: i guess versace is giving it a good look|pg||
nt|athene: this delay can't be Palma, can it?|pg||
nt|athene: his options over 5@S are: pass|pg||

mb|2H|nt|hedyg: you do a great job! my favorite operator :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Thanks :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: lol, that means a lot, given the amount of sessions I've seen you commentate, haha|pg||
nt|capercliff: that wasnt really a slow pass was it?|pg||
nt|haans: all the way i say|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: Gazzilli I presume|pg||
nt|mbruun: Sp K is huge, but still 1 NT is stretchy|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: No, it wasn't|pg||
nt|capercliff: tx|pg||
nt|paulg:  of course the Scottish expectations for this match will be low so Piper does have free rein to try for a result|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I just figured that with all my typing I might as well enter the bidding real life when I'm typing :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: why did he pass?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Wasn't he the 15 year old wonder boy 10 years ago?|pg||
nt|bogier: ktr mog³aby doprowadziæ do sytuacji ¿e N podejmowa³by decyzjê na poziomie 4|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, for promotion, but he can do that no matter which trump trick he wins|pg||
nt|mamos: ah yes  he just didnt do it |pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: There is some kind of socialist festival going on outside with loud music, fire crackers and a small carnival|pg||
nt|brolucius: Some players use a new major at the two-level (facing a weak two-bid of some sort) to be invitational but non-forcing. In that way they can pick up the games where there is a fit ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: for responder's suit. A new suit at the three-level is forcing.|pg||
nt|petergill: Interesting (disciplined?) that Sementa chooses 3@D raise rather than direct 4@S|pg||
nt|petergill: I expected North to bid 5@C|pg||
nt|paulg:  Shields bids 2@s so that he can compete in hearts on the next round ... if there were one|pg||
nt|jkotor: inv or GF?|pg||
nt|lechcold: 2@H = zajmij BA|pg||
nt|yuval10: guess not|pg||
nt|peachy: I wouldnt think so|pg||
nt|peachy: but of course I dont know their agreement|pg||
nt|yuval10: interesting play to 3@h|pg||
nt|peachy: on range/ranges of 2NT|pg||
nt|haans: 2nt not as good as it was|pg||
nt|yuval10: if def. play AK@s and K@d....|pg||
nt|yuval10: declarer can't enter his hand to draw trumps|pg||
nt|viren169: Needs the J of diamonds to come down in 3|pg||
mb|3C!|nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|dougdscsu: really dont like pass with Piper's hand, hes got 9 hcp and support for partners suit..|pg||
nt|paulg:  i'm sure it was an 'action' pass|pg||
nt|andy_h: Looks like a swing for norway here|pg||
nt|brolucius: Neither East rates his hand as worth a 2@D bid to show a sound raise to 2@H. No, but it is around a maximum for the direct raise.|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@H is 7+|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I am being told Finnish and Hungarian have a shared ancestry, there you go kids, don't believe what you're being told :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  Italy chipping away at the lead with 2 imp gains on boards 7 and 8|pg||
nt|athene: normally when you push opps to the 5-level, you don't do anything after that|pg||
nt|athene: they might be one down; they might have missed a slam|pg||
nt|athene: you are in a really advantageous situation|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 2@C either natural or any 16+|pg||
nt|bogier: troche zamieszania- Cezary walczy z w³asn¹ intuicj¹, która podpowiada³a mu skrecic w BA|pg||
nt|bagman: If @SK were wrong and the clubs very badly, declarer got from the lead a heart trick for his 10th trick|pg||
nt|mamos: perfect playing conditions for bridge|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I am sorry, sometimes bid don't register properly...|pg||
nt|cicus: that theory is already refuted|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: That's only proving my last point :)|pg||
nt|athene: if this auction was forced on EW by system it's not a great advertisement for polish club 1@C opener in competition, i don't think|pg||
nt|schtsch: noone will understand it but it could get them to slam|pg||
nt|schtsch: 1@s positive|pg||
nt|schtsch: 1nt relay|pg||
nt|schtsch: he bid balanced hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Palma had a swift pass, it was Versace thinking|pg||
nt|athene: right|pg||

nt|jkotor: wyrzutka kara na kiera|pg||
nt|jkotor: i dojcie pikiem do dobrego kara, ¿eby pika wyrzuciæ, ale to na widne|pg||
nt|jillan:  the Swedish women got 25 against France|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I'm guessing 2@H is a transfer - i.e. showing a spade raise of some sort|pg||
nt|milton_se: going for a beautiful slam ...|pg||
nt|milton_se: 2H is support|pg||
nt|jillan:  shows 4@S|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: If N can't keycard to 7 something is very wrong|pg||
mb|3H|nt|mdgraham: 2@H natural but denies 8+hcp|pg||
nt|capercliff: he might double if they reach 5@d?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: he is only 23 I hear, born 1987|pg||
nt|bagman: There were entry problems to go for that line and set up 3 heart tricks|pg||
nt|hedyg: as usual the @c suit got lost|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer is playing close to DD|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Sorry all, the OR crashed so we had to reestablish the link|pg||
nt|wstuart: this is a tough one. 2 controlish hands with the right doubletons opposite length in the other hand|pg||
nt|rnmalik: comes the @D switch.|pg||
nt|toral5: couple of imps 4 holland|pg||
nt|mdgraham: now, when 3NT comes back in the tray, East will know he's done the wrong thing|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: And not the @D9xxxx|pg||
mb|p|nt|andy_h: The 2@S opening did its job, with the 3@S adding more preemptive value|pg||
nt|lesniak: oczywiscie wist w trefla kladaie 3 ba ale kto to wymysli|pg||
nt|antoniz: please heart lead|pg||
nt|brolucius: And the @D suit.|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Don't NS play weak 2's?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Or did Madala judge it as too bad|pg||
nt|barnets: same contract|pg||
nt|petergill: North does not like to use the Pass Card unless he has to|pg||
nt|paulg:  as it happens, the double fit means that they have missed game|pg||
nt|koksoy: and  2@D  seems  natural...  because he  prefered to  bid 2@S  with  4-4  major|pg||
nt|bagman: Sementa's going to play a trump now|pg||
nt|schtsch: 3@d obviously his shape|pg||
nt|rv: I prefer 1n rebid with South hand with 5422 and min hand|pg||
nt|drorp: Lauria isn't sure he's making 5 yet|pg||

mb|4D|nt|Walddk2: 3@C natural, NF|pg||
nt|bagman: here there are 3 top tricks to lose and then declarer has to guess the trumps (which he will after this lead)|pg||
nt|antoniz: dobrze Rysiu:)|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: pañskie zyczenie jest rozkazem|pg||
nt|vasmar: E-W can make 3@D|pg||
nt|hedyg: not 2suiters, no|pg||
nt|petergill: Bas - when in doubt, assume that Ozols did not pass?|pg||
nt|athene: if east really has to jump all the way to 3nt just to show the strong hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  great dummy for N|pg||
nt|athene: versace assumed the 5@S bid was a club but not huge red-suit strength so there's strong likelihood of two red losers|pg||
nt|mdgraham: however, 2@c looks exquisitely reasonable|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 2@H is wow|pg||
nt|paulg:  might double 3N|pg||
nt|hedyg: specs suggest he cannot play the hand if he raises |pg||
nt|capercliff: or 3N for a @s lead?|pg||
nt|mamos: 3NT was good i was just going to say   but  .....|pg||
nt|brolucius: Six cards, 4-10 points, on their card.|pg||
nt|hedyg: but E could have bid 2@d here|pg||

nt|snetram:  kierowy atak stwarza problem|pg||
nt|jkotor: nasi ³adnie tutaj wistowali w Otwartym, ale RZG ustawi³ wpust|pg||

nt|schtsch: 3@h asking controls or something|pg||
nt|wstuart: Does anyone know exactly what Croatia needs in this match to advance?|pg||
nt|schtsch: don't know their system, just guessing|pg||
nt|schtsch: 27:3 :)|pg||
nt|tokay1975: i thk  pass  was  pass  by versace |pg||

nt|viren169: in which suit|pg||
nt|haans: good q|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Interesting here is how does S cue @H and set @D as trumps at the same time?|pg||
mb|4H!|nt|Walddk2: So 16-18 with spades and clubs|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Is there a brake pedal to this auction?|pg||
nt|sybarra: nice of @S's to be 3/3|pg||
nt|mbruun: North will probably lead a diamond against a spade contract, and the 3-3 break combined with good intermediates allows it to make|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Sementa could have passed 3@C|pg||
nt|mdgraham: he could have passed 1@S too|pg||
nt|mbruun: With a nondiamond lead declarer lacks an entry|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Indeed|pg||
nt|capercliff: 4@h is a good contract|pg||
nt|dougdscsu: still hope for italy, 2-1 now|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Thanks|pg||
nt|capercliff: and maybe 6@d on any lead other than a @h|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Won't tell him until the contract is over, dw Scots :)|pg||
nt|xenya: and a huge one|pg||
nt|bagman: Then, on the other hand, declarer might have lost a spade and two clubs with the heart|pg||
nt|stc: -5 possible|pg||
nt|hedyg: now J@C|pg||
nt|hedyg: well, only 50/ trick|pg||
nt|toral5: infact 1 imp.cant go less thn 2 down i guess|pg||
nt|milton_se: couldn't imagine the 5-card Cs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The Swedish women are indeed in the 25-2 VP range, but still 8 boards to go in the match|pg||
nt|toral5: rkcb in @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Declarer must take steps to avoid two trump losers. Ace and low to the jack will work.|pg||
nt|brolucius: He can afford that safety play only when he knows that there are only two losers in the side suits.|pg||
nt|brolucius: With three side-suit losers he would have to play the A-K, hoping to drop a doubleton queen.|pg||
nt|atabey: very good pass by assael. could be a cold 4@h|pg||
nt|hedyg: did we miss out a double Bas?|pg||
nt|bagman: They are on their way. West seems to think that diamonds are solid (and they are :) )|pg||
nt|marlowepi: after the king of hearts drops the queen from N, there is a good case for swtiching tacks and knocking out the ace of clubs. you want to take the entry out of the hand that has the ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: long diamonds|pg||
nt|mamos: Pric wants more|pg||
nt|sybarra: but spades are 3/3 |pg||
nt|rv: I might have given false preference to 2@h with North hand if the auction proceeded as 1@h-1@S-2@d|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: I'm not a traditionalist but would happily pass the S hand|pg||
nt|athene: *5@S bid was a club void|pg||
nt|atabey: versace has nothing extra to thk. even less then when he was bidding over 2@c|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: I didn't see it, barring human error, no, no Xs|pg||
nt|atabey: probably yes|pg||
nt|hedyg: and it was for sure Sementa who bid 2@H? not Assael?|pg||
nt|atabey: what is 2@h by sementa otherwise|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: That I am sure of|pg||
nt|atabey: then 2@h was by assael for sure|pg||
nt|hedyg: double by Duboin seems pretty automatic after 2@d|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: That's correct, I might've missed it|pg||
nt|petergill: A boring game, 5@D would not be much of a save|pg||
nt|schtsch: denial now|pg||

nt|toral5: is 4@D kickback?|pg||
mb|5H!|nt|brolucius: Lauria passed 2NT after the same start in the Open Room. |pg||
nt|hedyg: maybe|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: In any case, S declares 3@D :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|atabey: so duboin dbled. is that correct?|pg||
nt|andyv:  always tough to play them when you are in 6|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It would be a travesty if Duboin bid 4@S, North led a diamond, and 4@S got wrapped up|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is not down yet|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Yes, I know it can be defeated but you don't always get the best defence|pg||
nt|mdgraham: might be difficult for NS to switch to hearts, after the 2@H bid by East |pg||
nt|bjacobs: The defence will need to grab their heart tricks when in with a spade (or earlier)|pg||
nt|toral5: duck|pg||
nt|viren169: Now it is (should be) RKCB in hearts|pg||
nt|viren169: 2 key cards w/out Q|pg||
nt|haans: who is asking?|pg||
nt|toral5: now north knows tht @S king is wid pd|pg||
nt|toral5: cos he denied @H q|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: @SAQJ @HAJ @DJ @CJ is 14 HCP, so he doesn't have to have @SK|pg||
nt|viren169: Neither side can count 13 tricks... |pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: we dont know Yalcin|pg||
nt|hedyg: lets assume he did|pg||
nt|andyv:  as a spec points out, 6@s is also there|pg||
nt|sybarra: yikes|pg||
nt|marlowepi: wd|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: lol|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Well, you opened 1@H partially because of your distribution, right? Why then not bid that second suit?|pg||
nt|rv: Gabrielle used her women's instinct and made the wnning bid of 2@s|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: should have keycarded over 1@S imo|pg||
nt|haans: many bid a direct 4nt as 4 card B|pg||
nt|viren169: 5@S can determine the K of spades... but it wont help|pg||
nt|haans: 4 aces B|pg||
nt|viren169: It is the J of diamonds or xx(x) in diamonds that is the key to this hand...|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: they've got 13 back on the 6@S|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: Enough of linguistics :)|pg||
nt|jkotor: czyli 4 najlepsza ze s³abych kolorów|pg||
nt|athene: but @CK wasted|pg||
nt|drorp: his hand mainly had 2 extra spades than he already promised, but that's quite significant|pg||
nt|haans: nowday all play that 2NT is weak (6-10) or strong 16+|pg||
nt|viren169: Germany stayed in game on the last|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: Declarer should play for the drop in diamonds but people do finesse sometimes|pg||
nt|andyv:  dbl here could be devastating to declarer|pg||
nt|athene: even if south led the @CA and got it ruffed, one pitch might well not help declarer|pg||
nt|viren169: 6@C is asking for trouble|pg||
mb|6D!|nt|schtsch: slovakia needs to beat wales|pg||
nt|schtsch: nicely bid|pg||
nt|corplaw: 20 bd match requires winning by 48 imps to get max 25 VP|pg||
nt|frululu: Croatia is 5VP behind Wales...|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So we have to mark this down to a strong-club problem?  Not respecting the club suit?|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: Barbosa has left for the bathroom|pg||
nt|drorp: I am told the same contract is played at the other room, so a push it seems|pg||
nt|rhelle: he's still likely to make it|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Not everyone would agree on whether 3@C is forcing after such a start. If it was, then a pass seems wiser.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No rush yet, but soon ....|pg||

nt|wstuart: thank you to all who provoded information|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - problem with 3 NT may be misfit when W has 5 @S|pg||
mb|p|nt|sybarra: this will roll now |pg||
nt|marlowepi: it was always rolling i think|pg||
nt|sybarra: with ace of @D on side yes |pg||

nt|viren169: It is all done with a wing and prayer here|pg||

nt|Walddk2: sorry ignore that|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 4@D the limit|pg||
nt|athene: 5@D is a bit flawed :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I think the Italians favour 1M openings with 15-17NT as they play a convention also known as gazzilli after any expected responses|pg||
nt|peachy: Zack guessed correctly that it is a misfit|pg||
nt|haans: Zack scored big (sort of)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Yes, though I'm overdue for my operator prank ;)|pg||
nt|peachy: oh you little devil, Bas :)|pg||
nt|yuval10: well, 4@d won't be making , so not THAT big|pg||

mb|p|nt|hedyg: indeed|pg||
nt|andyv:  NS more ambition in OR.. reached 3N down 1|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3H has a lot going for it|pg||
nt|wstuart: The question was asked, what happens in the case of a tie?  I don't know how that is resolved in this contest.|pg||
nt|schtsch: slovakia 16-14|pg||
nt|marlowepi: spade ace likely, good for dec|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Mutual result, I suppose|pg||
nt|frululu: slowakia just gone in lead 16:14|pg||
mb|p|nt|pasker: only 3 obvious losers but a lot of work to do especially with trumps 4-0|pg||
nt|andyv:  if you are the underdog, the N hand is one that you might want to play around with and open... maybe 3@d, or 1@d or even 1@h|pg||
nt|bagman: South might X the spade game|pg||
nt|bagman: he might not beat it|pg||
nt|andyv:  not with N passing|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Clear preference he has|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 2NT asking, 3@H possibly medium hand with @C shortness :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't pass with N hand|pg||
nt|koksoy: with 23 4-4  fit  and  a  singleton  its good to  play  4  , but most of the  pairs have not methods after 1nt openning|pg||
nt|petergill: Very conservative by NS - who went wrong?|pg||
nt|athene: i suppose fear of two spade losers might slow north down|pg||

nt|rnmalik: 3NT for EW.|pg||
nt|toral5: frm d spectator point of view|pg||
nt|toral5: ohh|pg||
nt|toral5: should attack @H immediately the defenders|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|hedyg: A@d and @s|pg||
nt|mbruun: Third quarter for Italy |pg||
nt|brolucius: Excellent work by Mossop! Many would go on bidding on that collection.|pg||
nt|petergill: In the World Rankings, the highest ranked Italian player in this team is Giorgio Duboin, ranked the 2nd best player in the world. The highest ranked Latvian in this team is ranked ...|pg||
nt|petergill: 684th in the world.  (My figures may be a few months out of date)|pg||
nt|athene: that was quite some 3@H bid, vul against not|pg||
nt|hedyg: 6@D is off on a @S lead|pg||
nt|snetram:  kierowy to poprawny atak|pg||
nt|athene: if 4@D is just a splinter, 4@S is a very big bid|pg||
nt|athene: basically if you make a cue which raises the level of the final contract, that should be a good hand|pg||
nt|drorp: now that he knows his A@D is worth nothing, he'd wish he could bid 4@H|pg||
nt|toral5: gud 4 kibs if i m eaten away.they ll get to see NICE BRDS.lol|pg||
nt|haans: will he not even if u feed him :)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|brolucius: I once made 3NT on just 24 points but I can't remember the hand now.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: After 6 defensive errors I presume|pg||
nt|brolucius: No, there was a good suit in dummy.|pg||
nt|jtr: Are you planning a trip down to Chandler's Ford now you live in London Roland?|pg||
nt|tez: interesting pass from sementa to 3@s (hand 10)|pg||
nt|daman: yes     strange|pg||

nt|mamos: oh i see transfer|pg||
nt|Gerben42: who is  1? |pg||
nt|babs59: together with @SA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't agree with the jack. That will give her a losing option|pg||
nt|yuval10: S didn't play trump|pg||
nt|yuval10: probably sure that his P has a singelton|pg||
nt|peachy: this could end up as push|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Vugraphznk: The look on Versace's face in indescribable|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3Nt means interesting hand (@S are fixed)|pg||
nt|bagman: If EW bid in confidence, S should not X. If it's invitational, X would be fine|pg||
nt|hedyg: quite so!|pg||
nt|athene: after 4@S it's going to be hard to stop north|pg||
nt|atabey: barbosa is very happy now. showed clubs then short @d then void @d|pg||
nt|athene: if i were north i would bid a slam after hearing 4@S|pg||
nt|athene: i certainly wouldn't have bid 4@S as south|pg||
nt|drorp: that's why i prefer not to splinter with voids, singleton and void are totally different you can't have the same bid to show either of them|pg||
nt|atabey: he told everything he had. I'd pass in a sec|pg||
nt|athene: i agree it's very important to differentiate as quickly and clearly as possible between voids and singletons|pg||
nt|drorp: opposite singletong, south thought his hand is working well, only J@D wasted, and has a club fit, not that i agree with 4@S, but i can see why he thought about it|pg||
nt|athene: they just aren't the same :) not even close|pg||
nt|april7: the 4 @S bid might be the ace ,then N has a difficult decision|pg||
nt|drorp: also, his pass on the double already showed a minimal balanced hand... otherwise he could bid 2@H\3@C|pg||
nt|athene: 5@D exclusion might have worked - south bids 5@H saying no keycards outside diamonds, end of story|pg||
nt|drorp: XX\whatever|pg||
nt|drorp: 5@H is too high already|pg||
nt|drorp: i think N should pass|pg||
nt|drorp: why did u bid 5@D if you're not passing 5@H?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Barbosa bid 6@H and Lauria has called the TD|pg||
nt|toral5: on target |pg||
pc|sK|nt|brolucius: North considering a pass. Yes, he has passed.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bill, remember to tune in for the cricket in 30 mins|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 9-0 at the moment|pg||
nt|bjacobs: too tired, too uninterested|pg||
nt|bjacobs: There's something a bit wrong with this auction ...|pg||
nt|bridge_one: after passed hand right to give the chance to play slam|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Madala apologising now|pg||
nt|petergill: Should North do more? South?|pg||
nt|athene: if he heard 5@S he would bid 5NT grand slam force|pg||
nt|athene: maybe 5@H very slow and lauria thinks north has to pass it|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I daren't say|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|andyv:  EW are one pair that always bids in confidence:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I suspect neither would South|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I thought it was because of the salary|pg||
nt|bjacobs: well, that too|pg||
nt|jillan:  on board 13 the Swedes stopped in 1@S made 2 and Sweden got 7 imps|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Bocchi showing his hand but not claiming...|pg||
nt|jillan:  the match is now very even|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Thinking the claim over|pg||
nt|sharkey: ty Andy - explains it|pg||
pc|d4|nt|Walddk2: Yes I am|pg||
nt|brolucius: I look forward to it.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Just waiting for David to send me an invitation for lunch|pg||
nt|jtr: Dont hold your breath|pg||
nt|othered1: Note that Duboin stayed out of the auction, despite vulnerability.  West's action in OR bought -800, abetted by east.|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: *is|pg||
nt|toral5: haans u really want me to get killed:):(|pg||
pc|d5|nt|Walddk2: and Marc Smith. That could be fun|pg||
nt|brolucius: Consider yourself invited (after the world cup is over).|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer is going to take his finesses in the majors and ends up with 10 or 11 tricks|pg||
nt|bagman: A spade to the 9 now?|pg||
nt|bagman: and then heart?|pg||
nt|paulg:  hard to believe that the cards could lie so well|pg||
nt|drorp: yeah 5@H was quite slow, but normal tempo in slam bidding|pg||
nt|atabey: lots of specs saying 4@s is a way overbid. I agree. even @d shortness is good you have to have some points also :)|pg||
nt|athene: this might be only a small loss, though|pg||
nt|athene: might be 5@H-1 in the other room|pg||
nt|april7: I think the 4 @S bid was to much for N to bear|pg||
nt|athene: yes, you are forcing to a slam with north after 4@S|pg||
nt|athene: well i am :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: It won't matter much in the end, since 6@H will go down|pg||
nt|athene: maybe i had better not play with Palma|pg||
nt|atabey: so I have to take it back what I said about N|pg||
nt|athene: but i would not have responded 2@C; i would have shown heart support first round|pg||
nt|april7: if you can show a void and support in @H, but a splinter(singleton) is not enough|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Versace asking Palma about other bids Barbosa could've made|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 5@H made in the other room after a spade to the ace|pg||
nt|Walddk2: That set up the queen for a club pitch|pg||

pc|d7|nt|bjacobs: 3@S is not in any way invitational is it?  So is North allowed to bid 4@S?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Something is an underbid|pg||
nt|antoniz: dobrze idzie|pg||
nt|pasker: that lead should help|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|iain sime: Should be 1100  |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Everyone knows hos the cards lie in a second|pg||
nt|Walddk2: (no club)|pg||
nt|hedyg: he might regret that J@S|pg||
nt|athene: yes i didn't mean makeable necessarily i mean they might get bid|pg||
nt|cicus: I wonder why W overtook, he could have gone to hand with a @D|pg||
nt|athene: i am told france brought home 6@S|pg||
nt|schtsch: with only 2VPs available for croatia here|pg||
nt|april7: big swing then for Italy|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|vasmar: there was a safe heart lead for N |pg||
pc|sQ|nt|Walddk2: Thank you|pg||
nt|petergill:  1 is Fulvio Fantoni, pushed up by his World Pairs win in 2002|pg||
pc|s2|nt|hedyg: if 2NT could be this weak E had no business bidding 5@d|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@d by N in OR was unusual vs unusual|pg||
nt|othered1: Maybe they don't have a narrow range for the action at this vul and east was taking a general direction shot.  But double of 3@D might bring partner back in on the right hand.|pg||
nt|hedyg: France is killing Lithuania, so far 51:1 after 13 bds|pg||
pc|c7|nt|bridge_one: the lead help|pg||
nt|bagman: Now this is more or less over. declarer has many ways for 10 tricks and some for 11|pg||
nt|brolucius: Madala is looking around for an Undo button. 'Sorry, I don't know what happened. Obviously I meant to pass over 5@D.'|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|stc: E has better majors|pg||
nt|stc: As I heard on BBO:"my daughter bounced my arm"|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: lol|pg||
nt|hedyg: cannot use that excuse in Ostend|pg||
nt|brolucius: Mind you, who can say that 5@H was wrong? He could have ended up being a hero if the North and East hands were adjusted a bit.|pg||
nt|hedyg: 56:1 sry|pg||
nt|cicus: now has to settle for 11 tricks as a @H ruff would make N's @S87 a trick|pg||
nt|jkotor: szansa na -2|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer's best chance to make the contract is the same as playing for max|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|paulg:  this is an important match for Wales as they are currently lying 9th in the standings and the last qualifying spot, just 8VPs clear of tenth|pg||
nt|marlowepi: these two countries both claim nationality credit for Marco Polo|pg||
nt|rnmalik: wd|pg||

nt|mdgraham: Sure North is allowed to. Whether it is wise to do so is a different matter|pg||
nt|xenya: good @D switch -- Italy is likely to pick 2 imps here|pg||
nt|andy_h: Not much to this hand. Declarer's thinking suggests that he is trying to protect against any foul breaks which is what you want to do in case it happens|pg||
nt|bagman: The @CA is marked south|pg||
nt|bagman: So is the @SK with some confidence|pg||
nt|athene: the italian NS did very well to reach 4@H on 13|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Suspect the problem is the 2@S bid|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I play Gametry XX here, so 3@S is just stonewalling opps|pg||
nt|Gerben42: also Italian - they have a lot of players to pick from|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Tough for N to keep his @H though|pg||
pc|c5|nt|sybarra: maybe they play it over any club|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|bagman: Declarer is going to be at the crossroads soon; is he going to play on the clubs or on the hearts|pg||
nt|capercliff: the 10@h would have been a great card to find|pg||
nt|toral5: haha|pg||
pc|cK|nt|jtr: Looks like this is going to drift a few off at least|pg||
nt|othered1: And AKxx of their likely trumps is a lot better for defense than offense.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If they are married, as Mike suggested in the beginning, he will hear about it all evening and night|pg||
nt|bjacobs: And Sementa finds a truly evil defensive play, putting South under all sorts of pressure|pg||
nt|sybarra: I suspect they have sorted this out much earlier than now |pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I think they are btw, same rings though she has it on her right hand and he on his left|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer has quite a good count of the hand and can go for the line to make 11 tricks|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Anyone for some ping pong?|pg||
nt|hedyg: good defense by E|pg||
nt|Walddk2: N and W might just as well fold their cards|pg||
nt|stc: In the USBC trails Moss-Gittelman payed 2200 in -5xx, this one will be cheaper |pg||

nt|hedyg: not 2, not 3|pg||

nt|brolucius: A conservative assessment.|pg||
nt|bagman: Playing 5@C, what would you do on a diamond lead?|pg||
nt|pasker: N may open 3@D here and is likely to play there|pg||
nt|bagman: Might W X?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: may South pass ? :)|pg||
nt|athene: north had better not do something silly like lead away from a king on opening lead|pg||
nt|paulg:  They are a very small bridge nation and it would be a first|pg||
nt|koksoy: why  do  you  think  so?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: The boards certainly haven't been boring!|pg||
nt|babs59: except Norway Germany is only board 8!|pg||
nt|petergill: North has redoubled, so full credit to Alfredo Versace for not reopening|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you might try 2NTas South, but it's only 9 hcp, and the singleton heart isn't exactly a bonus|pg||

nt|sharkey: sry - Luk's|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Note that playing for a squeeze (this one is called a Vienna Coup, by rejecting a finesse) was the percentage play on that board. Madala knew the @DK could not be onside as West ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: had shown up with @HAKJxxx and did not overcall|pg||

nt|babs59: is the DBL a negative bid perhaps?|pg||

nt|babs59: often it's the negative after overcalls|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 6@C is a maker here because @SK is onside and @ST9 stiff, I think|pg||
nt|corplaw: EW can make 2C; don't know why sementa ran from that|pg||

nt|bagman: N is not going to sit, I guess|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 6NT with a not unlikely @H lead is on, haha|pg||

nt|skorchev: asking for imps? :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  W has easy @s lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  and can probably switch to @d without much ado|pg||
nt|skorchev: usually pass followed by DBL shows 9-11 hcp, balanced hand without fit|pg||
nt|fabsayc: diamond switch is 7 for declarer|pg||
nt|koksoy: who  afraids vulneribility  and  lack  of  points ??  not  Duboin|pg||
nt|paulg:  North's 4@s is reasonable, but not what South wanted to hear|pg||
nt|bagman: Pass or raise? South has shown a good diamond one-suiter|pg||
nt|koksoy: pass  is  ok..|pg||
nt|bagman: Any move and NS go minus|pg||
nt|paulg:  at this vulnerability the ace of hearts may be opposite void|pg||
nt|koksoy: sometimes S has 11  winners  but  its good  to  play  9 or  10  for  him|pg||
nt|koksoy: 8 or 9|pg||
nt|paulg:  club finesse may need partner to hold @c10|pg||

nt|wstuart: is 2@D showing @Hs or a 1 suiter?|pg||
nt|schtsch: wales 288 croatia 287 latvia 286|pg||
nt|drorp: very hard to set this contract|pg||
nt|athene: double is penalty-oriented but duboin (quite correctly, i think) runs with his weak balanced hand|pg||
nt|haans: Polish invention|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznk: lol|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And we (Denmark) have been involved in the most entertaining match so far, the one against Cameroon|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: Yes, congratulations to those teams :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznk: I liked the one against us as well, Roland ;)|pg||
nt|brolucius: West's 3@C will be some sort of heart raise - perhaps a mini-splinter. |pg||
nt|brgpro: let's not talk about football...the chinese team didnt even qualify from Asia...|pg||
nt|hedyg: just claim 11 and next|pg||
nt|hedyg: no time for coffee|pg||
nt|atabey: so he did :)|pg||
nt|dougdscsu: what an exciting week in both bridge and sports worlds|pg||
nt|bagman: W is going to try a surprise spade lead|pg||
nt|bagman: Here the size matters, is he going to lead the A?|pg||
nt|brolucius: South surely has nothing to think about, it must be West thinking.|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Never mind me, I counted 9 @Cs|pg||
nt|athene: ok - it's a bit more serious than that - it takes club lead and immediate diamond shift to beat, i think|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: EW explaining in detail whispering what their auction meant and NS said together "Drury"|pg||
nt|andyv:  N blinked|pg||
nt|fabsayc: actually 1nt looks cold|pg||

nt|bagman: Good decision; sometimes partner has the wonder cards but most often not|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 7-card major+raise=game|pg||
nt|ziff:  In the race for the qualifying positions the first 7 teams in this group should be fairly safe by now, with Wales, Norway, Hungary, Latvia and Croatia fighting it out for the last two spots.|pg||
nt|athene: south can do something to ask for a heart|pg||
nt|athene: ok|pg||
nt|athene: i think you should only pass these doubles with some values|pg||
nt|toral5: muller did find a gud bal in the form of 2@S|pg||
nt|toral5: 3 also should make|pg||
nt|robinswr: when your partner balances, you need lots of extras to continue |pg||

pc|s5|nt|bagman: NS found a good sac here :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  a little rich with the vul but the distribution hard to argue against|pg||

nt|viren169: Pushy 3N here|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jtr: Either West hasnt go a 3@c bid or East a 4@h bid|pg||
nt|brolucius: Better to not qualify than to reach South Africa and play like idiots.|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: I'd feel more comfortable bidding 1@S and raising @H after that, wouldn't that describe my hand better?|pg||
nt|brgpro: well, versace did the same but Lauria just gave it a try then signed off when pd said so|pg||
nt|brolucius: I will not be adding this bidding method to my card.|pg||
nt|jtr: 3@h weak looks ok to me as a passed hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Icemen are fearless. As soon as there is a game in sight .....|pg||
nt|brgpro: anyone is interested to talk about table tennis?:)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: to be fair, on a different lead it would have been a 5 or 7 hand|pg||
nt|hedyg: rofl|pg||
nt|paulg:  Also partner could have bid 6@d himself .. you have shown values with 4@s|pg||
nt|petergill: Bd 15: The reopening Dbl has led Italy to 4@h at the other table|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Wales, eh? :)|pg||
nt|wstuart: this may well be a huge swing|pg||
pc|sA|nt|athene: i don't see much chance of declarer getting his hearts away on spades|pg||
nt|bagman: Reminds of the meckwell deal against pakistan some (30) years ago|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, we all remember that...|pg||
nt|brolucius: Again it must be West thinking at this point. The bids are made in pairs, each side of the screen.|pg||
nt|bogier: system kanape?|pg||
nt|athene: i imagine the way to make this is get the clubs going fast for diamond discards|pg||
nt|athene: but i think declarer might have to be looking at all four hands to find the winning line|pg||
nt|koksoy: look  at  the  methods ..  how  you  can  find a  game  after 15-17  nt  opening  as  Ýtalians  did|pg||

nt|babs59: the trump break stops declarer - she can no longer lead @HA and @H, then cross to the third @C in dummy|pg||
nt|babs59: because South can give her partner a ruff - so it hinges on the @S again|pg||
nt|babs59: no matter how long she thinks, this contract comes back to one line only|pg||
pc|dA|nt|capercliff: will he go the right way?|pg||
nt|bogier: nasi 2 BA wygraj¹|pg||
nt|ziff:  Good thing for Germany that Finland doesn t qualify, they only got 5 VPs against them...|pg||
nt|toral5: 74-7 is something too much for the type of hands we saw just now|pg||
nt|tokay1975: i looked the  calendary last round is italy israel  possible final waiting for us|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|sybarra: played from the other side,  and declarer got overruffed in @H's |pg||
nt|mamos: it wont here|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: the ultimate to set up a trcik in opps suit|pg||
nt|mdgraham: cricket season here, Carl|pg||
pc|dQ|pc|d4|nt|hedyg: hmm|pg||
nt|athene: but as expected declarer isn't to pick this position|pg||
nt|andyv:  10@s?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: The auction *almost* ended three times lol|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: poor def deserves a rotten result|pg||
pc|d2|nt|capercliff: when W plays the J@d he can equally have the Q|pg||
nt|capercliff: so it looks to me that either hand can have lenght in @s's|pg||
nt|capercliff: this could be important in terms of the match|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Versace looked at me with a look of despair on his face and I shook my head, Italy out|pg||
nt|capercliff: and rightly taking his time|pg||
nt|capercliff: he might consider playing the K@d then 4 rounds of @c's, but that doesnt really help him here|pg||
nt|petergill: We are in effect at the halfway stage of the event, with Italy, Sweden and Iceland doing best, then Poland and Israel, then a whole bunch of teams, in my opinion, after correcting ...|pg||
nt|petergill: for the removal of scores against non-qualifiers. |pg||
nt|toral5: correct play.|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|mamos: unlesss|pg||
nt|jkotor: mo¿e A@h na ilociówkê?|pg||
nt|snetram:  nie lekcewaÅ¼ przeciwnikÃ³w|pg||
nt|jkotor: no có¿, chyba wiêcej nie mo¿na sobie pomóc|pg||
nt|snetram:  ale dobrze myÅlisz|pg||
nt|jkotor: ale jeli obaj zrzuc¹ prawdziw¹, to mo¿na im próbowaæ wierzyæ|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So even if the king gets a discard from South, he can play back a diamond and get a quick pitch|pg||
pc|c3|nt|andy_h: Fair enough.|pg||
nt|bridge_one: he is vuln !|pg||
nt|vasmar: after 10 boards the score is 37-3|pg||
nt|koksoy:  board 14...  maybe  that  is  the  difference  my  friend...  being   as  mostly  or  special  :)|pg||
nt|paulg:  they play the same methods, the difference is that Bocchi gave his partner the opportunity to show a good hand|pg||
pc|c8|pc|cA|nt|toral5: did italy play israel?|pg||
nt|tokay1975: no|pg||
nt|toral5: ok.and italy is yet to play poland also|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|brolucius: I see that Versace (West at the other table) also responded 3@C.|pg||
nt|bogier: ....mam nadziejê.....|pg||
nt|mamos: ahh |pg||
nt|hedyg: and claim|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Thank you all, we'll be back in about an hour|pg||
nt|hedyg: ty all bye for now|pg||
nt|cicus: now -2|pg||
nt|tokay1975: still have 3 matches and who knows  for sure just apossiblity|pg||
pc|dK|nt|brolucius: The deals have been strangely subdued, in all three sessions that I have watched from this event. (No bonus should be paid to the provider of the auto-dealer).|pg||
nt|bagman: They stood in 3NT XX. Right lead and -9 or something. Wrong lead (made) and 10 tricks|pg||
nt|antoniz: ja te¿|pg||
nt|toral5: unfortunate 2 find pd wid @S ace|pg||
nt|viren169: Another poor contract let through!|pg||
pc|h3|nt|bagman: He's going to cash out and hope for something nice to happen for -1|pg||
pc|h5|nt|bagman: Nothing happens, though and it's going to be -2|pg||
nt|babs59: well she found a nice option based on South having @S109|pg||
nt|toral5: looks like last rd ita-israel wd b the final match|pg||
nt|tokay1975: but this gets  exited |pg||
nt|toral5: interesting end position here|pg||
nt|toral5: wil have to play @C ace now|pg||
nt|sharkey: never understood the game Mike - sry :(|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I think that was a very conservative pass by Luks with the 0625 hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Too bad, they are very pretty|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Oh, crap|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Obviously only +1|pg||
nt|daman: yes   110|pg||
nt|andyv:  good point, Bas:)|pg||
pc|d9|nt|andy_h: I wonder if it's worth to advertise declarer's shape to the opponents when usually the most likely contract will be 3NT after declarer has denied a 4 card major|pg||
nt|robinswr: south is making north pay for inviting. seems like he misguessed the play|pg||
pc|h6|pc|h7|nt|Walddk4: Thanks to all spectators for watching. We hope you enjoyed the show|pg||
nt|petergill: As Barnet says, the AK combinations are very strong and push the value of the hand up, while the 4333 shape pushes it down in value|pg||
nt|toral5: ohh.he is in dummy:(|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I'd also like to draw your attention to the Women's series, for the first four teams are within 13 VPs of eachother|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Bye for now|pg||
nt|brolucius: Thanks for watching!|pg||
nt|vugraphzsm: Thanks all|pg||
nt|vugraphzsm: bye now|pg||
nt|iceblue: bye|pg||

nt|mamos: declarer plays like this|pg||
nt|gulyas: boo, 3 to Italy:)|pg||
nt|snetram:  sÄ czujni|pg||
nt|haans: but England not close to World Championship|pg||
pc|d8|nt|bagman: Lauria did not overruf with a sure trump trick. In many cases that's the sound policy|pg||
nt|pasker: he did start with 3 @Ss|pg||
mc|11|nt|brolucius: Turkey made 6@C doubled on this deal, I am told.|pg||
nt|andyv:  and Cyprus more than dbld their score on board 11|pg||
nt|skorchev: :):)|pg||
nt|kiwibridge: traditional rivals tho|pg||
nt|haans: and its getting late|pg||
nt|viren169: Not vintage bridge from the Oldies!|pg||
nt|viren169: thks all|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Does anyone know the contract in the OR?|pg||
nt|haans: :) Thank and We´ll meet again:)|pg||
