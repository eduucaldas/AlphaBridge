nt|brolucius: I wonder if South's pass of 1@C will eventually allow declarer to drop the @SK offside.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: hello Peter, Gerben, Ugis and Barnet|pg||
nt|ugis: Latvians playing Precision here and Polish club in the other room|pg||
nt|petergill: An untidy contract to reach|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 2@C must have been some art. rebid|pg||
nt|gulyas: this a good day so far for Hungary, scoring 29 and trying to climb back to contention|pg||
nt|hedyg: hi guys :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: hi andy, spectators|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Bas|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulg:  Wilkinson-Piper play a fairly standard version of Precision, in a typically aggressive style|pg||
nt|hedyg: the official website is : http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/10Ostend/Information.htm|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hello everyone|pg||
nt|bagman: Hi all|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Yes, set and ready to go|pg||
nt|mamos: good afternoon from England|pg||
nt|barnets: hi all|pg||
nt|ugis: yes, 2c artificial here|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Welcome Barnet :)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: so looks like a Burn's law violation|pg||
nt|Gerben42: (opps have more trumps than declarer)|pg||
nt|petergill: NS Convention Card is http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/May/OpenTeams/latvia/Ozols-Romanovskis.pdf|pg||
nt|Gerben42: probably not much lost as natural bidders would reach 3@C, which has problems on this trump break|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  dbl here by W should deny 4 spades. so E might be better to bid the @d suit|pg||
nt|xenya: and Martin |pg||
nt|bagman: Here NS are lucky to make 4@H|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Hey Mike, Shirley :)|pg||
nt|sybarra: canape sequesnce it seems |pg||
nt|mamos: yes ew stong club canape |pg||
nt|mamos: english pair 4 card majors natural style|pg||
nt|iain sime: Hi everyone. Both pairs are using fairly natural methods. For Italy 2@Dis strong, for the Swiss it is a weak 2.|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: As is Ostend :) Hey Iain|pg||
nt|hedyg: Polish @c for EW|pg||
nt|gulyas: a win here may still help them get in the top9|pg||
nt|athene: standard for NS|pg||
nt|athene: (strong and 5)|pg||
nt|gulyas: EW plays polish club|pg||
nt|bagman: Looks like strong club opening and two suited 2NT or misunderstanding|pg||
nt|koksoy: it  may be  lead directing purpose..|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: Slightly pushy game, but preempt improves it.|pg||
nt|ziff:  I met him a couple of years ago at an EBL TD course|pg||
pc|d8|nt|kiwi_joker: Madala in a comon position for us all .. not want to sell out to 2@S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hello Shirley, Bill and Mike|pg||

nt|Walddk2: And hello to Bas too|pg||
nt|bagman: or actually 5@H|pg||
nt|lesniak: witam wszystkich|pg||
nt|ugis: 2h showed h+c, min, S has forgotten the system :)|pg||
nt|athene: both pairs upside down carding|pg||
nt|petergill: A quiet hand to start|pg||
pc|d3|nt|bjacobs: This will be a stern test for Lithuania ... no joy on board 1, although 4@H is a fairly normal contract|pg||
nt|sybarra: everything off side here,  |pg||
pc|dT|nt|xenya: @Hs rightsided|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Hey all, welcome back :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hello Pekka and Ben|pg||
nt|bagman: North has a very unfitting hand for South. 3NT might have made but the bad diamond break probably kills even that|pg||
nt|pasker: Hi everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and Andy|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Heya Ben|pg||
nt|brolucius: The 2@C overcall has helped them to stop low on good values.|pg||
nt|iain sime: Even hot in Edinburgh!|pg||
nt|brolucius: 12 winners (a requirement for a slam) but 2 losers (a negative slam feature).|pg||
nt|ni hao: salut|pg||

nt|Walddk2: You forgot to add the seniors, Bas. Here is the complete new macro|pg||

pc|dA|pg||
nt|atabey: even w/o preemt normal to reach|pg||
nt|fabsayc: a fair bit of upgrading, this should make|pg||
nt|bagman: North would like to cash a spade and return a trump|pg||
nt|andyv:  some work to do here|pg||
pc|s2|nt|andyv:  should be an easy down 2|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 9 tricks in @S for EW because of good @S and @D splits, I think|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Bas:)|pg||
nt|andyv:  but 4th @d should allow declarer to pitch a @s|pg||
pc|s4|nt|kiwi_joker: yes, but not a contract that was ever likley to be doubled|pg||
nt|andyv:  1st board partials tend to get away with murder... no one is ready to commit 11 or more imps:)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Italians must play that 3@D is weaker than a pass on the East cards.|pg||
nt|mamos: The English pair very experienced of course  - winners in Worls Seniors|pg||
nt|sybarra: nice lead to take the entry out of dummy fast |pg||
nt|barnets: e/w do quite well in diamonds|pg||
pc|sK|nt|xenya: played by S. it goes down on a @D lead|pg||
nt|sharkey: Will need to drop @SK to make|pg||
nt|bagman: South should IMO raised to 3@C instead of the 2nd pass|pg||
nt|lesniak: liczymy na lepszy wystep naszych|pg||
nt|bagman: Without X, this might be relatively cheap|pg||
nt|andyv:  the Italians are so good, they merely sent East and West to play for them.|pg||
nt|andyv:  not a bad pair here either|pg||
pc|s7|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: Hey Andy|pg||
nt|pasker: Yes always relieving to see game going down as well if you are not doubled|pg||
pc|c5|nt|henryb:  It looks like declarer should take 2@s, 1@h, and two in each minor|pg||
nt|paulg:  Wilkinson-Piper also play very fast, so this should be a quick set|pg||
pc|c2|nt|brolucius: 3@C would have made life a bit more difficult for West.|pg||
nt|hedyg: S needed 6+ hcps to bid over 1@c|pg||
nt|bagman: If E gets into the elimination position he can afford to finesse in spades to endplay N;|pg||
nt|hedyg: hard to read 9@c lead|pg||

mb|2D|nt|Vugraphznk: I imagine there being a banner on www.eurobridge.org|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: The URL is in my profile as well|pg||
nt|bjacobs: In 6@C, if you can avoid the heart lead, you can even lose the club finesse and maybe make.  As it turns out, there are other issues involved|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/10Ostend/Ostend|pg||
nt|bjacobs: In fact, 6@C on this layout will make on a heart lead!|pg||
nt|mbruun: 4 NT should suggest 6-4 here, while 5C is 5-5|pg||
nt|capercliff: Bas, tell him they are down by 3 goals already!:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Better to not go than to go like the French|pg||
nt|jbgood: 2 @d normally at least invitational in clubs|pg||
nt|bagman: I used to play Romex in 1981, then the opening was called Mexican 2@D (bal about this strength)|pg||
nt|stc: and, once ops are fixed on @s, 3NT is an easy make|pg||
nt|brolucius: West should have every reason to be nervous about this auction - having not shown his values at all.|pg||
nt|hedyg: how many times can you pass with 10 hcps opposite an opening?|pg||
nt|iain sime: 3NT would have made in practice.|pg||
nt|Gerben42: both hands 4333... should be in 3N|pg||

nt|babs59: 5C makes for EW if no H switch early enough!|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: If I'm gonna open west's hand, I'd like to bid 2@D.  But that's a big if.|pg||
nt|babs59: I meant for NS|pg||
mb|2N|nt|kiwi_joker: If he had enough entries, he could lead spades from dummy 3 times for a very positive outcome (West covering first two times) .....|pg||
nt|andyv:  the 4 of @s just too big a card to overcome|pg||
nt|barnets: well done|pg||
nt|koksoy: as diamonds are 2-2  contract  depends on  heart guess|pg||
nt|petergill: Sorry we cannot explain what the bids mean|pg||
nt|ziff:  Versace will surely try for slam, but the 5-level should be safe, as a @D ruff is with the natural trump trick|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: 2@s shwoing a minimum hand with @ss and @cs|pg||
nt|jtr: showing|pg||
nt|boz_: ala fantunes|pg||
nt|petergill: The play of 3@DX corrected to 3@HX is hard to analyse, if South went for blood|pg||
mb|4S|nt|xenya: good stop, good lead|pg||
nt|bagman: E has soft values but he has so much of them that he has to at least invite|pg||
nt|brolucius: A recent book recommended a 5-4-3-2-1 point count (5 for aces, 1 for tens) when responding to 1NT. That would upgrade the value of the East hand.|pg||
nt|hedyg: no they dont open 1NT with 5 card majors|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I can't hear what they're saying exactly, but it's not Puppet I believe|pg||
nt|hedyg: i think 2@d denies 3 + cards in @H|pg||
nt|bagman: West has a good hand: aces and kings and the only Q in the suit where it surely works|pg||
nt|antoniz: kontra w 2pik powinna pokazywaæ lepsz¹ rêkê,moim zdaniem|pg||
nt|gulyas: EW lead 2nd/4th|pg||
nt|athene: can't see declarer finessing the six of trumps so this will lose two clubs, three trumps...maybe he will finesse spades too for a heart pitch|pg||
nt|athene: unless east gets endplayed somehow|pg||
mb|p|nt|mamos: NS play 4 card majors|pg||
nt|marlowepi: presumably will rise and play a spade|pg||
nt|hedyg: or he will ruff out Q@s maybe?|pg||
nt|andyv:  should make this|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: Looks like 9 tricks or so with the lie of the cards|pg||
nt|atabey: zorlu will have to guess @hs|pg||
nt|othered1: Personally, I'm not big on semi-psychic openings and would prefer to have some defense if I open.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Or "can" make|pg||
nt|mbruun: Good save by the Italians. East unstopable after the thin overcall|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Anyway, 5@S doubled is a pretty normal outcome|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Esp with @S, the Italians like to come in at the 1 level|pg||
nt|mdgraham: EW basically natural with a srong NT. NS play the NASZ system|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i predict down one|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: However, 8 might not be so easy:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: but nothing in their CC|pg||
nt|bagman: About 25 yars later it has been resurrected|pg||
nt|lesniak: oczywiscie jego istotnoæ polega na tym ,¿e wynik tego meczu bedzie sie liczy w finale|pg||
nt|bagman: The heart guess is getting no easier|pg||
nt|bagman: because S needs @HA for his opening more or less|pg||
pc|cK|nt|athene: finesse must be better odds surely|pg||
nt|hedyg: a 3rd seat minor preempt is not necessarily weak|pg||
nt|athene: trump switch now would not help the defence, of course|pg||
nt|ziff:  I suspect 2@C was an artificial gameforce, 2@D may be balanced or nor @H support|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@C likely a general GF, perhaps 2@D = not three hearts. Just guessing though|pg||
nt|petergill: EW quickly established that slam was poor. The 2@D response to 2@C looks like it showed a minimum hand |pg||
nt|ziff:  Great minds all think alike ;)|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@C asked, 2@D = not 3@H, 2@S GF natural, 2NT minimum balanced, 4@S = end|pg||
nt|petergill: from my Italian source|pg||
pc|d9|nt|koksoy: ým  sure D uboin will decide good after @S A @SD in N hand|pg||
pc|c9|nt|sybarra: bid 1 looks like severe punishment |pg||
nt|hedyg: so he either has 4@ss or no major|pg||
nt|petergill: The bidding makes picking the @D's fairly easy|pg||
nt|andyv:  don't see how... 5@hs, 2@s and at least 1@c|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good morning to David Bird|pg||
nt|brolucius: Hi to the kibitzers!|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: Heya David B :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: The proposed new point-count system had two big flaws, as I see it. (1) No-one wants to have a 60-point deck and to need 34 points to open 2@C. Too difficult to count that high. ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: Also, you don;t know whether you will end in NT during the early bidding, so impractical to upgrade the Q/Js, which will have less value in an eventual suit contract.  |pg||
nt|bogier: E zorientowa³ siê z ogólnego przebiegu licytacji, ¿e wejcie partnera(chyba brata?) by³o s³absze i wyhamowa³|pg||

nt|sybarra: little frisky agst the Italians in the other room maybe|pg||
nt|athene: that's interesting shot - playing his partner for the ace of spades, hoping for @SA and another, and now declarer would duck, fearing the switch was a singleton|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|jtr: GM DB9|pg||
nt|bagman: The ruff wil come with trump trick and the club can be later discarded on the diamond|pg||
nt|ziff:  :)|pg||

nt|Walddk2: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/Events/ebl/2010ostend/default.asp  for convention cards and other useful information|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, 4@H was mildly unlucky|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I like the 2@C overcall, but West's raise to 3@C was more dubious.  Whatever, the Italians had booked a gain by stopping in a partscore|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but there is a question of whether 2@H in the actual sequence is (a) sign-off (b) invitational (c) forcing|pg||
nt|barnets: it would certainly have been more interesting to watch peter|pg||
nt|Gerben42: not so clear at this vuln to prefer defending|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|bagman: Assuming that declarer guesses the spade layout|pg||
nt|bagman: Which he really should even with the restricted choice|pg||
pc|hA|nt|jtr: problems|pg||
nt|marlowepi: dont understand the second trump, but maybe i am not awake yet|pg||
pc|h2|nt|marlowepi: had trumps been 4-1 the second heart would have ben fatal, but there would have been chances by leading a spade|pg||
nt|brolucius: Possible intra-finesse in clubs.|pg||
nt|gulyas: it was not a bad idea, it was just wrong here|pg||
nt|athene: ok, one down|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer is likely to draw trumps now|pg||
pc|h4|nt|bjacobs: Most would play (a) ... but North might raise anyway.  The 4@H bid seemed to be "a lot"|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, some ******* has stolen my address book and is sending adverts that seem to come from me.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: for example, you can play 2@H as invitational and 2@C as a puppet to 2@d, so that 2@H is then pass/correct |pg||
nt|marlowepi: probably N judged that if trumps were 4-1 E would not have led a singleton|pg||
nt|petergill: True|pg||
nt|fabsayc: yes your right, can score all the trumps|pg||

nt|sybarra: can it be weak multi also?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: No, just a BAL hand just under 2NT opener|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am sure Duboin would swap 21-0 for 0-21 if it gave the Azzurri a late equalizer in yesterday's game.|pg||
nt|bagman: Sure, but he had an option and there was this restricted choice thing in spades|pg||
nt|sybarra: and another game for n/s |pg||

nt|paulg:  2@h is 11-15 three-suiter excluding diamonds|pg||
nt|paulg:  the old Precision 2@d opener|pg||
nt|sharkey: so would rest of Italy David :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Restricted Choice is even more powerful than normal when J-10-9 is a potential holding (three equal cards instead of two).|pg||
nt|barnets: harder to reach :)|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Your commentators are Bill Frisby and George Holland|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Hey all :)|pg||
nt|athene: 2@D the popular italian gadget to show strong-ish balanced, just under a 2nt opener|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: this 4@S game is untouchable|pg||
nt|sharkey: the Vienna system which may still be used by some had 7-5-3-1 count David - 68 points in the deck|pg||
nt|hedyg: David are you implying that Lohay should have ruffed with the jack?|pg||
nt|brolucius: J-10, J-9 or 10-9 is three times more likely than J-10-9 (instead of the normal twice as likely).|pg||

mb|p|nt|jtr: Quite a result  Doesnt look easy to make 12 tricks with the distribution|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@s was alerted... must be intermediate values?|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't believe it's weak:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: That's what I thought, Fayad explained it as weak though|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Anyway the awkward preempted sequence has placed them in a Moysian where the split is frtiendly|pg||
nt|mbruun: Declarer lacks entries for the double hook in diamonds, så with this fortunate lay-out, 12 tricks are possible. 4 H as the Italians reached is a decent spot as well|pg||
nt|hedyg: that might have worked|pg||
nt|lesniak: E powinien wznowic- ale widac ze sie boj¹ naszej pary|pg||
nt|pasker: I assme this is keycard from N, some pairs use transfers at the 4 level to bid RKCB and use this sequence as quantative|pg||

nt|hedyg: NS CC: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/May/OpenTeams/italy/bocchi-madala.pdf|pg||

nt|barnets: reasonable but 3N would have won the marbles|pg||
nt|petergill: Good stop, as cashing out against 4@S is fairly easy|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: I imagine 3@C being Puppet Stayman after which LV reverse 3@H and 3NT|pg||
nt|daman: Hi Billand Roland|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: So 3@H denies 4/5M and 3@S is a puppet to 3NT after which N may offer minors|pg||

nt|andyv:  Versace not one to be timid on leads|pg||

nt|bagman: "First you cash your aces and kings, then you cash your partner's aces and kings and the you wait for two trump tricks"|pg||
nt|andyv:  Goran style?|pg||
nt|bagman: The club lead can be very very wrong |pg||
nt|bagman: if the slam is bid on marginal tricks|pg||
nt|hedyg: still seem to be playing puppet though|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 3M after 3@C must be something else then :)|pg||

mb|p|nt|fabsayc: light but effective|pg||
nt|petergill: Against this EW, 3NT would have gone: @D lead to ace, low club - not easy to get it right|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West hasn't promised anything, so 2@S should be a simple competitive effort|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: Shabby trumps, unlikely to guess the layout|pg||
nt|hedyg: can we switch to 6@c now?|pg||
nt|bagman: because of the overcall|pg||
nt|bagman: and the ruff coming anyhow|pg||
nt|brolucius: Now it is no good to guess the @HA-x because West would get a club ruff.|pg||
nt|bagman: He should play for drop, because he might still have chance to set up diamonds with Qxx hearts and xxx diamonds in the same hand|pg||

nt|mdgraham: The old volunteer for the color you submitted the high jump at ¶ 3 is invitational to you |pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: A Moysian (fit), for those who don't know, is a 4-3 fit named after the advocate of raising a 4cM opening with 3cM|pg||

pc|dA|nt|bagman: Now declarer can take the 3rd spade in dummy and take a club finesse for the contract|pg||

pc|d7|nt|iceblue: 3@H ¸ãÏÞÆÆÌ×|pg||
nt|brolucius: With hearts not being 3-2, he seems to be a trick short.|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's quite a charming translation|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 1 up with the @H finesse?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: But cashing out is probably better in Teams|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|marlowepi: doesnt even need it as cards lie. could just cash winners and exit in clubs|pg||
pc|d4|nt|pasker: Declarer likely to play for trumps 2-2 as has an extra chance if 3-1 of setting up @Ds for a 2nd @C pitch|pg||
nt|bagman: He should have gone up the @SA to have late entry to hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  E has easy exits|pg||
pc|d8|nt|daman: this will be over quickly|pg||
nt|gulyas: hmm, interesting play here|pg||

pc|s6|nt|Vugraphznk: Hey George btw, and thanks :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Anyway, declarer will play the overcaller for the @HA.|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: True, but the @H finesse is more elegant :)|pg||
nt|athene: you normally hope that an early ruff is from the trump length|pg||
nt|athene: when it isn't, there can be problems|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: N had the slightest of pauses before playing @DQ|pg||

nt|bjacobs: well, it's not exactly "full disclosure"|pg||
nt|sybarra: sounds like a volley ball game description |pg||
nt|bjacobs: Duboin really has a serious problem here - if that queen is singleton, which the odds suggest, he needs to cross to dummy to finesse diamonds|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I think I'll settle for the ECATS system document: available from http://www.ecatsbridge.com/Events/ebl/2010ostend/default.asp|pg||
nt|bjacobs: As it turns out, even if he does that, he will make, because then the 3-3 club break is revealed|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not every day i see someone say "the finesse is the more elegant line of play"|pg||
pc|hK|nt|othered1: Again, open room reached the same contract after a different auction.   Good efforts to stop at 2|pg||
nt|bjacobs: So I think he might indeed take the club finesse now|pg||

nt|athene: apart from anything east may now be endplayed|pg||
nt|athene: of course we can see he isn't :)|pg||
nt|gulyas: true|pg||
nt|athene: when he switches to a heart, will declarer decide the @HK is wrong, and try to ruff it down?|pg||
nt|athene: ok, maybe he is considering a trump|pg||
nt|hedyg: when declarer refuses to play trump.........|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer can ruff the 4th club in dummy now|pg||
pc|h2|nt|hedyg: @c ruff, draw trumps and run 9@H worked|pg||

nt|athene: 3@S looks pretty good for NS|pg||
nt|athene: but hard to know that really from south's point of view|pg||
nt|mbruun: These guys are professionals|pg||
nt|mdgraham: The Lithuanians let 5@D play on board 2 - likely afraid of pushing NS into a making slam - but 11 more to Italy |pg||
nt|bjacobs: that would be highly unethical, imo|pg||
nt|mbruun: Just kidding|pg||
nt|bagman: I think that 6@C would have failed also|pg||
nt|hedyg: quite possible|pg||
nt|lesniak: moze oni czuja ,¿e  to chwilowe?|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer is quite hard pressed playing against Italy in BBO|pg||
nt|andyv:  except that he did misplay it|pg||
nt|vasmar: Good morning all|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They are underdogs by at least 39 county miles|pg||
nt|pasker: hi Vassilis|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Not taking that finesse would've cost an IMP :P|pg||
nt|mamos: ahhh   action|pg||
nt|mamos: ACTION|pg||
nt|brolucius: I see that it means that when responder continues with 2@S over the requested 2@H, this has a special meaning. (Some players use that as Baron, looking for a 4-4 minor-suit fit).|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: The first two are clear, the third is the women event and the fourth is the senior event.|pg||
nt|gulyas: what happened here?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: "Scusa"|pg||
nt|hedyg: prego|pg||
nt|athene: if west had all the spades he just covers with the jack as he did there|pg||
nt|athene: and declarer has to lead into him|pg||
nt|andyv:  defense was friendly to declarer|pg||
nt|andyv:  can make 5@c here|pg||
nt|petergill: North might have competed to 4@C|pg||
mb|1H|nt|brolucius: Lauria bid and made 3NT on Board 2, where we saw them pick up +120 in 2NT in this room.|pg||
nt|athene: EW play standard count, NS play upside down count|pg||
nt|athene: both pairs play strong notrump, 5-card majors|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Mathias forgot a :)  I think|pg||
nt|bjacobs: ah|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: lol, I was wondering|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He was not kidding when he threw me 19,81 meters down a slope 22 years ago|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Anyone for Michaels with that North hand?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: NO|pg||
nt|jbgood: trump lead not a big sucess that time|pg||
nt|xenya: friendly lead -- anything else might have made declarer sweat a bit|pg||

nt|bagman: Hi Vassilis|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Vassilis|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not rue, as i said, cashing winners and exiting in clubs leads to the same overtrick at no risk|pg||
nt|mamos: strong|pg||

nt|andyv:  about the strongest weak 2 bid you will ever see|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  looks like 4@h or maybe 3N|pg||
mb|2C|an|*|nt|hedyg: there are no live results as yet so pls stop asking us|pg||
nt|athene: 2@S gives east a slightly awkward decision|pg||
nt|athene: 3@H is very committal on such a modest suit|pg||
nt|athene: so double is reasonable|pg||
nt|daman: he chose the lesser of 2 evils|pg||
nt|mbruun: Good suits|pg||
nt|sybarra: I am a michaels here,  I michaels on everything |pg||
nt|mdgraham: Include me out, as Sam Goldwyn once said|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I think it's a terrible Michaels vulnerable|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Shirley, one of the very top players in my area agrees with you.  He thinks the only excuse for not coming in with a 5-5 is that you are dead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I have a mild aversion to going for unnecessary 1400 penalties|pg||
nt|jbgood: the setting trick would /might have come in clubs....|pg||
nt|rodvenn: can Italy get to 5 @c?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 35 IMPs in 3 boards, the Italians are avenging their honour, it seems|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@H= gf|pg||
nt|stc: italy in 5@d on board 2|pg||
nt|fabsayc: he could have tried spade to 9 first|pg||
nt|andyv:  he did... he lost to 10|pg||
nt|fabsayc: when that loses to ten he switches to hearts on second entry|pg||
nt|andyv:  ah, ok|pg||
nt|andyv:  so before he touches @hs|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: well, it's only mild ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 500 point save in 5@S|pg||
nt|bagman: NS have started by bidding quite aggressively. It's a reasonable strategy when being an underdog|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@C Precision|pg||
nt|snetram:  Holandia, Austria i Anglia|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|daman: bidding 3@H would be aiming at a very small target|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D alerted because it promises some values|pg||
nt|athene: (2nt would be rubbish)|pg||
nt|daman: he might try 3@H now|pg||
nt|athene: i think east should just pass|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Not really worth it|pg||
nt|brolucius: Had West made a weak jump overcall of 2@S and the opponents then settled in 6@C, declarer might play East for the @HA.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Perhaps Slovakians were up all night celebrating.|pg||
nt|bagman: North has some options: 2@D, 2NT, 3@C and 3NT|pg||
nt|bagman: all depending on their agreements|pg||
nt|marlowepi: maybe reach 7H|pg||
nt|mamos: control showing response|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: nie wiedzia³em, ¿e ci Szwedzi to tacy ciulacze...|pg||
nt|jkotor: o ile wszystkie te zespo³y wejd¹|pg||
nt|koksoy: major competition|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@H - not 3@H with two aces and flat shape|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: If you press the MOVIE button, you can see the entire scorecard and play through any of the deals at the other table.|pg||
nt|ugis: 1d looked strange :)|pg||
nt|babs59: yes - last hand's 5@D bid was only 1 trick stronger really|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|jtr: Transfer response|pg||
nt|jtr: 1@h showing specifically three cards i imagine|pg||
nt|brolucius: West's 1@H rebid suggests three-card heart support.|pg||
nt|andyv:  5 imps to Lebanon on board 3 as they bid 5@hx|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Yesterday Hedy advocated rebidding 2@S as opposed to 1NT on a hand similar to the current W hand because of @Hxx :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  aggressive dbl by Bocchi has put S in a quandry|pg||
nt|andyv:  3@c will probably end it|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Interesting options for Madala here ..he has best hand at table...hasnt said a word yet :) |pg||
nt|andyv:  right... that's the quandry|pg||
nt|bjacobs: so you might as well go for it|pg||
nt|sybarra: I figure, one bid gets this hand off my chest  |pg||
nt|xenya: quite sensible though|pg||
nt|rodvenn: pushed|pg||
nt|rodvenn: we dont know who thinks. probably charlsen|pg||
nt|Walddk2: When fixed stay fixed. Madala thinking about raising I suppose. I don't Charlsen is thinking|pg||
nt|rodvenn: the BBO operator probably cant see on the other side of the screen|pg||
nt|jbgood: my press colleagues here think it is Charlsen who is thinking|pg||
nt|hedyg: Lohay wondering how much his K@D is worth|pg||
nt|bagman: Personally I would have taken the more aggressive 2NT approach|pg||
nt|brolucius: In the open room there was no spade overcall at all, I am told, and declarer guessed the @HA. |pg||
nt|sharkey: On previous hand In OR Madala entered dummy to play @H towards his hand - like he knew E had Ax... - one trump loser only|pg||
nt|brolucius: I don't like 3@C much on those values. 2@D or 2NT looks better. |pg||
nt|sharkey: after @D lead|pg||
nt|bagman: South has a good hand and can see 7 quick tricks|pg||
nt|sharkey: agree David - about as good as he can get|pg||
nt|bagman: Partner can still have the diamond stopper and a trick|pg||
nt|lesniak: wg mnie to spory blad powiedziec 1 ba - E po 2 treflach opsa da kontre T.o a spasuje na 2kier, 2 karo |pg||

nt|bagman: With both black suits breaking there's 10 tricks in spades|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphznk: How about no bid?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I'm 18 and even I wouldn't Michaels it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But every time it's not your hand you have given the show away, and there is nothing that suggests that it *is* your hand with the values North has|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Nor any other immediate overcall|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Yes, my undo took a while :)|pg||

mb|3H!|an|6+!H|nt|andyv:  only problem with NT... no tricks|pg||
nt|andyv:  S will scramble for 7 tricks|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: 2NT is so seldom natural these days .. have we found a rare example?  :-)|pg||
nt|andyv:  Bocchi trying to decide|pg||
nt|andyv:  Q10 of @s makes him doubt that it's natural|pg||
nt|andyv:  but his minors are pretty sick|pg||
nt|andyv:  passing will probably push the board|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: several kibs think 2NT = scramble|pg||
nt|mbruun: Dbl of a Michaels could be treated as 7+ with 3c support. 2NT or 3H GF with 4c support, and if you have a penalty double just pass 2 Sp and wack them in the next roundat tti|pg||
nt|mdgraham: values? Well, all those fours must be worth something|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: *Tries not to laugh*|pg||
nt|sybarra: no chuckling at the table Bas |pg||
nt|bjacobs: I would pass as well, but the fact is that 5-5's can be quite powerful.  And the opponents don't always nail you, even when they should|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Looks like a playable method, Mathias|pg||
nt|bjacobs: The problem might be if partner intervenes before you get your chance to double|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Where did you nick it?|pg||
nt|mbruun: From Duboin-Sementa|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Another possibility is to double the 2@S bid saying: "partner, I am interested in penalties"|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That might stop partner from making a bid before you can get your claws on the next hand's bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: if only he could get to dummy|pg||
nt|Walddk2: By the way, 2@C shows diamonds as you may have guessed|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: It was Charlsen thinking, Madala had a swift pass|pg||
nt|sybarra: now for the cue bidding|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I count 16 tricks in any contract but @S EW :)|pg||
nt|gulyas: I am happy with the outcome as I am biased, but still surprised at the play|pg||
nt|athene: 6@S is there, but unlikely to be bid|pg||
nt|athene: oh sorry only 11 tricks|pg||
nt|athene: but surely they won't get higher than 4@S |pg||
nt|bagman: EW can make only 8 tricks in hearts|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@C FG 4+@C or balanced|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: 2@D would also leave more room for bidding|pg||
nt|bagman: Hoping that the cards lay well|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Hi Vassilis, welcome|pg||
mb|4H|nt|brolucius: 2@D only shows a sound raise to 3@C, so North has plenty for that. Then he can raise to 3@C on distributional values and fewer points (to be obstructive).|pg||
nt|lesniak: lub skontruje 1 ba|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Hey Vassilis|pg||
nt|mamos: i think East has shown 4 controls so West may well be off to the grand |pg||
nt|sybarra: 4 clubs is?   |pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I wonder what 3@S would've been|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: OR bid 1@S p 4@S ap|pg||

nt|brolucius: Is the 1@H rebid forcing, David?|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@c drury|pg||
nt|atabey: 2@c is a version of drury I guess. and 2@s shows a good raise for 1@s-2@s|pg||
nt|hedyg: he obviously devalued the K@d|pg||
nt|bagman: 3NT by N would have made only with diamond lead|pg||
nt|sharkey: cud go 2@D - 2@D - 3 NT|pg||
nt|brolucius: Then East might well lead a major suit.|pg||
nt|sharkey: The way this match is going - Yes|pg||
nt|bagman: East might figure out that leading a diamond might give the 9th trick|pg||
nt|lesniak: pokazujac sile ok 9 PC|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes |pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I guess they're cuebids|pg||
nt|marlowepi: i dont think clubs would take 16|pg||
nt|hedyg: not even time to get coffee on this board|pg||
nt|gulyas: right, thats what happened in the OR, in precision, its an easy bid|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I usually play that as 7-9 distr. with 4-5 @S...|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Oh, they play Precision? :)|pg||
nt|gulyas: yep|pg||
nt|koksoy: I dont  think  they  will  try 4@S|pg||
nt|koksoy: 10 easy  tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: The way i play it is 99% forcing as 1@h is unlimited|pg||
nt|brolucius: I see.|pg||
nt|brolucius: The bidding continues naturally after such a rebid?|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: lol at the Impage :)|pg||
nt|jtr: Useful to have all those @cs concealed|pg||
nt|brolucius: 6@S has been rescored as one down.|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: I can't imagine EW being in 6@S board 1|pg||
nt|brolucius: Justice!!|pg||
nt|jtr: Well, responder must have a way of forcing through a relay|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you can make game in clubs though:)|pg||
nt|petergill: Normal Precision bidding 1@C 16+, 2@D 5+ @D and 8+ HCP GF, 2@S 5+ @S|pg||
nt|gulyas: they play Szalay's relay precision|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@S - 5+@H one suiter or 4+ @C|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: Bocchi opened the screen and they started discussing even before the lead :)|pg||
nt|rodvenn: claims|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: True|pg||
nt|babs59: last time I tried 3NT with 10xxx (and against 1@C better minor) I had the same problem|pg||
nt|petergill: 2@S also minimum |pg||
nt|petergill: 2NT asks|pg||
pc|d3|nt|kiwi_joker: better not cover 10!|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jtr: I play 2@d asks opener to define their hand|pg||
nt|othered1: In other room west tried a simple raise, perhaps constructive.|pg||

pc|dA|pg||
nt|sybarra: now does N have stiff ace or q?|pg||
nt|hedyg: disc a @H|pg||
nt|babs59: West could have led 4th highest and smiled|pg||
pc|c3|nt|kiwi_joker: When in, Fayad needs to play A@S .. but Madala has given him impression he could have Kx still left. Always good to put doubt in defenders' minds!|pg||
nt|hedyg: or a @s :)|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: Duboin: "Deep finesse"|pg||
nt|Walddk2: lol|pg||
nt|sybarra: a wish trick |pg||
nt|bjacobs: Duboin's comment breaches copyright, doesn't it?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: must have been irresistible|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|athene: east should just count himself thankful that his partner bid diamonds rather than clubs|pg||
nt|mbruun: 11 tricks now. Spade entry for the diamonds |pg||
nt|brolucius: Bocchi bid 2NT on the North cards at the other table. If you put your cursor over the Open Room result, top-left, you can see the other auction. |pg||
nt|marlowepi: our mathematicians in the audience can tell us what the odds are, when you have 2 six card suits, that five of the cards will be the same in the two suits|pg||
nt|marlowepi: they must make astronomical look small|pg||
nt|sybarra: praying for 2/2 @D after @H's dont break or is there another way?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: with 43 club break do not even need to guess Ds or have good luck there|pg||
nt|mamos: yes i was thinking about 4-3 as always its about combining chances|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4 discrads on black suit winners|pg||
nt|mamos: whats the best order|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes I see the club 4/3  maybe easier |pg||
nt|sybarra: I am told 7 sp only 2000, but they you push them to 7 nt most likely |pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|jtr: @h raises show five cards (obviously) and are limit bids|pg||
nt|brolucius: With only 4 hearts and a rubbish hand, East has to sign off in 1NT, 2@C or 2@H?|pg||
nt|jtr: Others play the 1@h rebid as any weak hand which i think is inferior|pg||
nt|jtr: Right|pg||
nt|jtr: Anyway, how is he doing in 4@h?|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: He has to decide if it's KTx or K9x or K8 onside|pg||
nt|jtr: Not as simple as that is it?|pg||
nt|brolucius: North held off his king to give declarer a guess if he held Q-J-9-x-x, but he has given West a chance to pick up the trumps for no loser now.|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: @C aren't splitting so he should ruff a @C in dummy?|pg||
nt|jtr: North did very well not to cover|pg||
nt|pasker: declarer likely to be at least down 2 here, 2@S 2@H, 1@D, 1@C|pg||
nt|marlowepi: have to play trump ace first in case they are 4-0. then king of H, club to ace and club ruff, heart to Q and club ruff, claim|pg||
nt|mamos: you dont want to go off trying to set up Club when Diamonds 2-2 alll the time |pg||
pc|d2|nt|tez: it was 8/10|pg||
nt|andyv:  even with fancy foot work in @s suit, there still are only 7 tricks|pg||
nt|hedyg: claim|pg||
nt|gulyas: Szalay, easily the best player of the team (and probably of Hungary, too, some may say) is a rare sitout|pg||
nt|athene: declarer will probably try to ruff hearts in dummy|pg||
nt|hedyg: i thought Dumbovich was the best on the team|pg||
nt|gulyas: he is expected to play the rest of the matches|pg||
nt|bagman: South might be worried about the result as some might open the N hand and reaching game is then easier|pg||
nt|andyv:  there's no humor in bridge|pg||
nt|andyv:  :)|pg||
pc|d8|nt|mbruun: Made it easy|pg||

nt|bagman: Now declarer has 9 tricks as he's going to lose a heart; claim time|pg||
nt|brolucius: A kibitzer asks if 46-0 is a record after four boards. Only the all-seeing Great Dealer can answer that.|pg||
nt|hedyg: and Roland?|pg||

nt|kiwi_joker: yes!|pg||
nt|andyv:  5@d the likely destination here|pg||
nt|sybarra: stiff q would have been interesting with N |pg||
nt|Walddk2: But the finesse is with the odds as it also caters to AQx onside|pg||
nt|mdgraham: declarer got a diamond lead and club switch. Misguessed trumps|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: A two-suited overcall would've been less likely with @SQ- I think|pg||
nt|paulg:  well defended but you'd hope that it would be flat |pg||
nt|hedyg: well, a careless 10@H lead......|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/Events/ebl/2010ostend/default.asp  for convention cards and other useful information|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Bocchi had shuffled, put his cards back in, taken a new board, placed the tray and board on the table and took out his cards before EW knew what had happened|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's not a record|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Obermair inquiring about the @D, laughter all around|pg||
nt|brolucius: Playing a two-level response as game-forcing has some advantages, of course. If it didn't, most of the USA wold not use it. But it is not that wonderful. Here, for example, East ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: did not want to cue-bid the @CA (because he wanted to limit his hand) but West was still unlimited.  |pg||
nt|barnets: another 6 imps to latvia when italy reached 4@S|pg||
nt|barnets: on the last|pg||
nt|gulyas: sure, some would say Dumbovich, or Winkler is better, its open to discussion:)|pg||
nt|athene: he had a heart-club squeeze even if east had long clubs|pg||
nt|hedyg: well Winkler is not on the team|pg||
nt|hedyg: not this time..|pg||
nt|athene: another boring 4major+1 push :) so this discussion can go on |pg||
nt|gulyas: he opted not to play due to personal reasons and work|pg||
nt|hedyg: tough decision|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Interesting: would you try for slam with the S hand opposite a strong 1NT?|pg||
nt|gulyas: but he WAS asked:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: :) of course he was!|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: The board has been put in the wrong way around...|pg||
nt|koksoy: double  difference & one overtrick  is 7 imps  for  Wales |pg||
nt|koksoy: at the  3rd board|pg||
nt|babs59: a reasonable shot by South tho|pg||
nt|petergill: After 16 rounds, EW, who play in all Italy's toughest matches and sat out matches like Slovakia, Latvia and Wales, are +0.46 imps/bd for 11 matches played |pg||
mb|1N|nt|hedyg: ty Roland :)|pg||
mb|4C|nt|Vugraphznk: In their defence, it was a really quick one|pg||
nt|xenya: Bocchi didn't know 5@C was making but he felt he had to take an insurance in any case|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 55 is|pg||
nt|brolucius: Perhaps Roland is the Great Dealer.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: some of the laughter may be about something else:)|pg||
nt|stc: 5@d was made because the def helped dec to eliminate @h@S, and dec guessed the @c position|pg||
nt|brolucius: In other words, it is difficult for both players to combine getting their strength across and cue-bidding their controls.|pg||
nt|gulyas: its a very nice hand|pg||
nt|athene: you have to be confident to bid 4@H with that south hands|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Or 4@D, if you play SA Texas, I guess :)|pg||
nt|athene: i remember lauria-versace had a misunderstanding in that position in the bermuda bowl|pg||
nt|babs59: and unfortunate that East gets horribly squeezed in 5@C|pg||
nt|babs59: on board 2 the Italians found the 5@C vulnerable save, but EW bid on to 5@S making|pg||
nt|andyv:  S still wondering what to do with her 2 headed monster|pg||
nt|mdgraham: anybody watching who is Welsh may not be too amused at that, Peter :) |pg||
nt|petergill: The favourable vulnerability led Lauria to choose the more aggressive overcall|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: This one|pg||
nt|babs59: not what I'd have predicted|pg||
mb|5C|nt|brolucius: Now I think of it, 4@H was a bit of a pot on the East hand - with an unhelpful void in partner's first-bid suit. Still, overbidding is not a fault at this level.|pg||
nt|hedyg: a drop of blood, Bas corrected the score|pg||
nt|hedyg: now, now, lets not go overboard !|pg||
nt|athene: well 4@D is ok because partner knows it's something cute so will probably just bid 4@H|pg||
nt|athene: but 4@H - that is in danger of sounding natural|pg||
nt|andyv:  interesting hand for S|pg||

nt|kiwi_joker: minors break badly tho|pg||
nt|Walddk2: what would 2@D be I wonder|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Final contract 6NT= without @D lead?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Looking at only the N/S hands, you want to be in 6@C ... go figure|pg||
nt|mbruun: 6N is a decent spot. Without a diamond lead its wash, and otherwise you have to get the diamonds right|pg||
nt|rodvenn: was 1 sp alerted?|pg||

nt|Gerben42: may be interesting to note that Madala is a junior player originally from Argentina|pg||

nt|andyv:  everyone pointing to 3N|pg||
nt|andyv:  and W did miss a chance to really muddle things up by not bidding 3@h on his 2nd turn|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Because the diamond suit is "frozen"|pg||
nt|mdgraham: looks like North took 4NT as agreeing diamonds|pg||
nt|henryb:  you might try 3@s instead. That after all was the purpose of that bid|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Double = 4+ spades|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So on this auction 1@S shows the minors|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2NT relay|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@S seems to be a good spot to stop in|pg||
nt|gulyas: he knows N probably has wasted values in @H - unless he has the A|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: In Rubensohl (the way I play it), 3@H is 5+@S, so 3NT might just be SO or offer to play systematically|pg||
nt|gulyas: with a bad hand and no fit, you could still just bid 3@S|pg||
nt|athene: NS play 3@H is invitational+ so i assume with any minimum north just bids 3@S|pg||
nt|gulyas: now S may get excited|pg||
nt|athene: south might content himself with 4@H|pg||

nt|mdgraham: two aces + @DQ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: South thinks North has shown 5-5 is my quess|pg||
nt|mbruun: South seems to think that partner promised 55|pg||
nt|bjacobs: I assume they have a strong club base, hence the 3@D, and the small misunderstanding|pg||
nt|mbruun: Sry slow typing by me|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Lots of whispering on both sides|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It's a really tough hand to bid, to be honest|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@C is 12-14/19-23 balanced, or natural|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Then I don't understand 3@D at all ...|pg||
nt|paulg:  so you play in 3N opposite the @sA and lose the first five clubs with 5@d cold?|pg||
nt|andyv:  no, gives too much info away and hand isn't distributional enough|pg||
nt|bagman: I would not X myself but I admire the courage of those who do X|pg||
nt|hedyg: (as my English husband used to tell me )|pg||
nt|hedyg: they become British, never English|pg||
nt|gulyas: he is not sure where that would take him|pg||
nt|gulyas: 5@S or 6@S now?|pg||
nt|hedyg: so what is 5@C now? fit or cue?|pg||
nt|jkotor: czyli tutaj wynik bardzo wiele znaczy|pg||
nt|bagman: The club lead gives 8th trick|pg||
nt|koksoy: after club  lead..  Sementha  has 8 tricks..  and  will  try  for  jay  jay  squeze|pg||
nt|petergill: North played South for @DJ rather than @DK|pg||
nt|petergill: Find an 11th trick somewhere, I mean|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|jtr: The ecats site is more useful that the tournament site|pg||
nt|Walddk2: This is the only slam that does not make. I think 6@C, 6@H, 6@S and 6NT all make|pg||
nt|bjacobs: 6@H?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Oh well, hearts 6-1|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But it's a better contract than 6@D|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Indeed, in fact, I think it's probably the correct contract IN THEORY|pg||
nt|bjacobs: No, perhaps 6@C|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, good luck, North|pg||
nt|mdgraham: guess well|pg||
nt|brolucius: Chance of a slam is not wonderfulo, after the single raise, but typically the Italians will take a look in that direction.|pg||
nt|bagman: Maybe W relayed to see if E had 4-5-1-3|pg||
nt|vasmar: vulnerable no|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't think many do, Ben|pg||
nt|stc: the two black Q's in S will probably score|pg||
nt|lesniak: w pewnym momencie rozgrywajacy bedzie musial trafic czy N ma AKDxxx, Kxx, xxxx, czy aktualna reke|pg||
pc|c4|nt|atabey: thats a surprise. salvo(assael) playes 2@d natural normally. |pg||
nt|tez: first partscore swing i think|pg||
nt|hedyg: E denied a singleton i guess|pg||
nt|bagman: Then there might be a legitimate slam|pg||
nt|barnets: the 12 imps Iatvia gained is when after a natural 2N - North Bocchi looked for a major fit with 4-3-3-3 found one and went down|pg||
nt|athene: ok, going to the 5-level is a very serious statement and duboin will now surely bid the slam|pg||
nt|athene: wow, he didn't, even with all the trumps|pg||
nt|gulyas: interesting|pg||
nt|athene: i guess his rationale is, if north had everything needed he would just bid blackwood himself|pg||
nt|petergill: Could have played @HA, ruff 2 hearts ...|pg||
pc|cK|nt|Walddk4: Also welcome to Alwyn Jihe|pg||
nt|andyv:  ok, we can get rid of the 3N bidders...Bob's law about 3N was true on this hand.|pg||
nt|rodvenn: an alternative for Charlsen was to double the 1@s bid. but that is not where his honours are|pg||
nt|rodvenn: then Hofta probably would have gone on to game.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Ah.|pg||
nt|andyv:  so the 1@d showd 4+@hs and 3@d completed S's pattern|pg||
pc|c8|nt|jtr: Best lead|pg||
nt|jtr: He wil just cash the other @d and play @cs i imagine|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am told this gives the scores:  for running scores: http://eurobridge.org/competitions/runningscores/asp/roundteamsconditstatclassicmod.asp?qtournid=819&qshowflag=1|pg||
nt|hedyg: anybody bid 1@s with the N hand not being able to able to bid 2@D?|pg||
nt|andyv:  S has some choices... run 3 @cs and pitch 2@h and try to ruff the hand out|pg||
nt|andyv:  N was doing well with her passes|pg||
pc|cT|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, but East would then still need a bundle of good cards in the majors.|pg||

nt|lesniak: wlasnie, albo Kx albo kxx albo k10x|pg||
nt|petergill: Can still, as North has not removed a dummy entry|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|bagman: It might win a partscore but often it gives away info or induces partner to overcompete|pg||
nt|sybarra: does he play ace and spade now?|pg||
nt|brolucius: West limited his hand by not doubling 2NT (which showed a weak diamond raise). East did not have a clear-cut leap to 4@S over the delayed double.|pg||
nt|athene: hmmm ok a wheel has come off here|pg||
nt|hedyg: i dont see that N ever showed @s fit|pg||
nt|athene: if 3nt showed better than minimum, north should back-pedal all the way after that|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: N looks puzzled|pg||
nt|athene: since he has really a bad hand|pg||
nt|gulyas: N bid 5NT to pick a slam I guess|pg||
nt|athene: if north is looking puzzled now,  i would suspect that he thought south had hearts|pg||
nt|hedyg: seems like he was protecting K@H all the way|pg||
nt|athene: but then 3nt makes no sense because he has no spade stop|pg||
nt|gulyas: I think he should have bid 4@S over 4@H|pg||
nt|athene: yes, 5@C was definitely an overbid|pg||
nt|athene: if the auction all means what we think it does|pg||
nt|gulyas: @S stop? 3@H showed @Ss|pg||
nt|athene: but i think there are probably three interpretations of this auction here - north's, south's, and ours :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: where is the undo button?|pg||
nt|gulyas: :)|pg||
nt|athene: maybe four - North's, South's, ours, and the right one|pg||
nt|gulyas: I like where this is going, sry Italians:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Sementa: "I think this is a misunderstanding"|pg||
pc|h2|nt|iain sime: Meanwhile, East has done too much opposite a balancing double I think. Oh, and come on Germany!|pg||

nt|petergill: East can make, if he can see all the cards. |pg||
pc|c9|nt|jtr: Oh well done!|pg||

nt|kiwi_joker: I dont think it can make now, can it Andy?|pg||
nt|andyv:  i don't think so|pg||
nt|andyv:  can't ruff 2@cs and still pick up the @d suit... and he still has a @s to lose|pg||
nt|andyv:  if either minor behaved this would be a quick claimer|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Had to win first trick and play three top clubs, methinks|pg||
nt|paulg:  Versace may block the clubs here to get a heart through|pg||
nt|Walddk2: However, I also admire some imagination when you know that your opponents are much better players|pg||
nt|petergill: At the other table, North opened 1@S, East passed (sensible and disciplined) and Madala as South has responded 1NT, which could lead to a @D partscore, I guess|pg||
nt|Gerben42: the maximum for an Italian 1@S is quite high, still not passing was a position|pg||
nt|petergill: Actually, Lauria did well not to play hearts too early, else North would have been able to beat him|pg||

nt|capercliff: with just the A@s N doesnt have to bid 3N|pg||
nt|bagman: Sure but AQxx Kxxxx x Kxx gives some play, I think|pg||
nt|andyv:  the plus side is that both NS are original passers so they shouldn't get carried away by overbidding|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No offence intended of course|pg||
nt|andyv:  maybe... although dbl would seem indicated if that were the case|pg||
nt|petergill: East knows from Trick 1 that South has @DK and N has @DQ, so he knows all the high card layout|pg||
pc|c7|nt|iceblue: morning, its 17:20 here :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  now the bad news|pg||
nt|marlowepi: it is by no means trivial to wind up in 3N, making while 4S fails|pg||
nt|bagman: S is not going to like discarding but there's not much he can do wrong really|pg||

pc|sT|nt|jtr: Is there one for group B ?|pg||

nt|andyv:  E should refuse to over ruff here|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Lauria-Versace are in 4@S on board 5|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Just making I think|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer may reason that North was bound to lead a club or a diamond. His choice of a club may indicate that he holds the diamond ace, which makes a lead in that suit less ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: attractive.|pg||
nt|lesniak: lepiej bylo z karta adama otw 1 trefl i stanac w 1-2 pik:(:(|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: He was telling Bertheau all the cards he'd shown and then exclaimed: "four-triple-three!"|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: Lauria seriously considered playing @D3 instead of @H7 there|pg||
mb|1C|nt|capercliff: i can assure you the other room will be longer, Ash and Goodman not known as speed demons|pg||
nt|hedyg: so you all thought the 1@s opening bid was ok there?|pg||
nt|xenya: fireworks here|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is an example of Restricted Choice. If declarer had similar holdings in both the minors, he might have chosen to lead a diamond instead.|pg||
nt|bagman: especially if N is known to attack on opening lead|pg||
nt|lesniak: choc nie chcialbym uslyszec po 1 trefl np 1 ba lub 2 karo  od partnera|pg||
nt|lesniak: nie mowiac juz o 2 ba|pg||
nt|marlowepi: first u have to bid it, then they have to lead a nonclub|pg||
nt|brolucius: The bidding on the last deal was instructive. When you compete for a part-score, responder should be very wary of undoing your good work by going too high.|pg||
nt|hedyg: not really if he counted N's hcps|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 1-point upgrade|pg||
nt|barnets: count one point for good clubs|pg||
nt|petergill: Duboin and Sementa are among the very best card players in the world - the best, according to some people (especially from Italy). |pg||

nt|fabsayc: well successful, pretty skinny|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: might have gone for 200 undoubled|pg||
nt|barnets: that proves troublesome|pg||
nt|ziff:  Another @C would not have worked, as N could have discarded a @S. Declarer would manage to establish a @S, but would not be able to enter his hand again to cash it|pg||

nt|vasmar: 4@h be E easy|pg||
nt|andyv:  mini splinter?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I must say, NS don't seem to be intimidated at all... Not letting EW play they usually do, ask to see claims, etc.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: On board 3, Bocchi-Madala discovered the club weakness, but they are uncomfortably high in 5@H. It also got a spade lead|pg||
nt|mamos: i hadnt even thought about if it was making just expected to bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: pretty likely that S had Q@c|pg||
nt|brolucius: Double (competitive) can mean clubs and spade tolerance (usually a doubleton).|pg||
nt|Gerben42: with this @H stopper you need @C for 0 loser|pg||
nt|petergill: East hand is worth 20.05 HCP, according to Kand R Evaluator at http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=aq2+k64+k6+ak986|pg||
nt|mdgraham: mildly unlucky lead, that diamond |pg||

mb|2H!|nt|jtr: 4@h failed on 4|pg||
nt|brolucius: Had Bocchi taken David's advice and cashed the second diamond winner, he would have made an overtrick.  |pg||
nt|jtr: I would usually defer to him:)|pg||
nt|brolucius: South scored a club overruff to defeat 4@H at the other table.|pg||
nt|tez: 2@d=good raise|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Adam Kaplan wrote a book on the "Tired RHO squeeze", applying here as well :)|pg||
nt|xenya: 5@D now -- can W or E bid 6 after that?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Madala would like to get doubled in a number of diamonds. Contemplating how to achieve that|pg||
nt|rodvenn: 6@dx = 3 down?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He has no defence against any contract by EW|pg||
nt|rodvenn: Hofta will go on to 6 and Madala will save i think. Not poosible to get minus 4 in practise|pg||
nt|sharkey: slam time|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@d=4+|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@H= negative freebid|pg||
nt|brolucius: Why not raise to 4@H?|pg||
nt|athene: EW do play a slightly strange form of Polish club|pg||
nt|andyv:  just needed 2-2 @ds and @hs to behave...not too much to ask|pg||
mb|p|nt|iceblue: NS play prec, EW 2over1|pg||
nt|Walddk4: 2NT game-forcing with support I assume|pg||

nt|andyv:  spec says 8-11 any singleton, 3@h asks and 3N shows @d singleton|pg||
nt|hedyg: Bas says Bocchi was told 2@H is strong so maybe it isnt a NFB|pg||
nt|iain sime: This has allowed South another chance.|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@S = minors |pg||
nt|barnets: but in fact they led a spade v 3N in other room from south dont ask me why|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 2@d=@H|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2@S is what Kelsey used to describe as daisy-picking.|pg||
nt|athene: they play 4-card heart opener so the weak NT option in 1@C denies 4 hearts|pg||
nt|gulyas: sry, 15-17 with @Cs|pg||
nt|gulyas: an easy game here - some might try 6@C and succeed, but its not easy to bid|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: 2@D 2-way xyz?|pg||
nt|bagman: Italians are known to bid slams without 2 aces but I think that this generation uses RKCB as routine|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2way checkback, yes|pg||
nt|brolucius: The old 2-ace-missing system was so that opponents did at least have a chance of beating them.|pg||
nt|hedyg: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/documents/files/May/OpenTeams/italy/duboin-sementa.pdf|pg||
nt|bagman: And indeed in Stockholm they did|pg||
nt|bagman: West is going to make a try|pg||
nt|Walddk2: As we see, 4@S can be defeated on best defence|pg||
nt|hedyg: over 2@d they bid up the line, i.e. with 4@Hs he would show those first|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Heart lead ruffed, diamond to the ace, heart ruff, and @SA|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, a heart is a plausible lead. It would stand out if West had actually bid hearts, since East has shown a balanced hand.|pg||
nt|sharkey: Even with a @C back goes down|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes S gets a 2nd chance to find the right return|pg||
nt|bagman: No, but N gets the ruff|pg||
nt|brolucius: If North is leading a heart, expecting it to be ruffed, he should lead a suit-preference card.|pg||
nt|bagman: On club return W probably tries to ditch the diamond|pg||
nt|hedyg: but N has no indication of 4 cards in @H in W|pg||
nt|brolucius: Learned kibitzers claim that it is OBVIOUS to play in no-trumps.|pg||
nt|sharkey: rite - so far W has only shown @S so not obvious to lead @H for ruff|pg||
nt|marlowepi: another cheesy takeout double, though at the colours fairly normal|pg||
nt|sybarra: remember these are seniors not juniors  |pg||
nt|hedyg: 10@s for free|pg||

nt|sharkey: yes|pg||
nt|pasker: I think W may have been able to put Madala to a trump guess on that deal as @C weakness was marked|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Madala took all 13 by dropping @HQ, 11 IMPs to Italy|pg||

nt|lesniak: chyba ze czegos nie zauwazylem|pg||
nt|koksoy: they  will  play  4@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 4 or 5|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It's a miracle that a diamond stands up after the support, and yet they can't beat it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So there is something wrong with Madala's judgement in my opinion|pg||
nt|hedyg: and also got the @c ruff|pg||
nt|Walddk2: David's point is valid. *IF* North thinks he can give partner5 a heart ruff on lead, he should also leader a high card in order to show preference for the higher suit, diamonds|pg||
nt|brolucius: South has shown big black two-suiter, so cannot hold all three hearts.|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: czy B-N graj¹ w tej chwili w Tunezji?|pg||
nt|koksoy: it  needs  carefull  play...  but cards lie  friendly for  the  declearer|pg||
mb|4D!|an|Odd # of KC|nt|brolucius: Hi to the kibitzers!|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Oh I see|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Good morning David|pg||
nt|iceblue: 2NT is nat fg, It is very puplar in china|pg||
nt|brolucius: Win with the @HA, clear the spades (if there is a loser) and the defenders would then have to play a club to give you any entry problem.|pg||
nt|lesniak: w polsce nie stosuje sie odpowiedzi na Blackwooda pokazujace renons- szkoda|pg||
nt|bagman: 4@H makes now easily but generally this kind of contract can be quite delicate because of the misfit. It cannot stand bad breaks|pg||
nt|petergill: 6@C is a good contract, but both finesses fail|pg||
mb|p|nt|ryskiel_: a jak podobala by siê sekwencja 2@C-3@C-3@D-3@H itd?|pg||
nt|mamos: looking at all four hands  this looks straightforward enough|pg||
mb|6C|nt|ryskiel_: sorry 2@H -  3@C  mialo byæ|pg||
nt|babs59: there's no real source of tricks - make the clubs QJ10xx and yes I would |pg||
nt|petergill: 3@C showed 3+ card support|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: according to the CC, 3@c is Stayman|pg||
nt|hedyg: by Zivkovic|pg||
nt|bagman: The lead hurts more declarer's nerves than the contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|capercliff: he should have taken time on this one however, it was much better to play on @c's before playing a @s|pg||
nt|capercliff: he may even had made it|pg||
nt|henryb:  still one down, as he cannot untangle tricks|pg||
nt|capercliff: only 1 Henry?|pg||
nt|henryb:  Isner and Mahut now at 61-60|pg||
nt|paulg:  yes, who worries about (the number of) undertricks when non-vul |pg||
nt|hedyg: wow|pg||
nt|hedyg: they will play for ever!|pg||
nt|paulg:  more importantly, for some, Italy are still 0-1|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  no, I meant that even playing clubs first declarer would be down one|pg||
nt|capercliff: I was chatting with Roland last night, he was saying he might walk down to watch. This was at 56-56, thought he may get anothre hour of it:)|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer has quite safe 10 tricks by drawing trumps and giving away 2 clubs and a diamond|pg||
nt|Gerben42: @D ruff for 800|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: lol|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Nystrom showed his hand without a lead|pg||
nt|jkotor: 3@d = krótkoæ 8-10zz    zz: a=3, k=2, d=1|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: here, at any rate, it has proved to be wrong |pg||
nt|bagman: Now N is interested to know if 3@H shows suit or just strength|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Otherwise South will not know if he should lead a club or a diamond|pg||
nt|marlowepi: best lead for NS. looks like a snoring hand, but the double increasing likelihood of bad breaks in key suit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nothing you could have done if he had|pg||
nt|petergill: Normal contract at both tables, well bid, unlucky , assuming no @h lead|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mdgraham: 3@d/@H=transfers|pg||
nt|bjacobs: A simple approach is to just hope @HQ drops doubleton|pg||
nt|hedyg: hmm|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The point is moot now, so much for science|pg||
nt|hedyg: here N had the info and did not find the @H lead|pg||
nt|sharkey: Not their day - that was yesterday......|pg||
nt|athene: if north had a huge heart or diamond suit he might have bid it instead of 2@S perhaps|pg||
nt|snetram:  okazuje siÄ Å¼e sztucznie teÅ¼ moÅ¼na|pg||
nt|jkotor: mam dobre wpomaganie od Szwedów na priv|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: The lead wasn't really @SQ, there was no lead|pg||
nt|petergill: There is a silly double dummy line to make, which will not happen|pg||
pc|dA|nt|sybarra: but with the 3 @S bid,  looks like puppet |pg||
nt|Walddk2: What do you think, do the players from the "lesser" nations enjoy playing against Italy or do they fear it, especially when they are on vugraph?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if I read it right|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Both|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I think both as well|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I saw a Serbian player take the match card with the countries and player names yesterday :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: there is a lot of pressure when you are on Vugraph |pg||
nt|mbruun: Possible push for Lithuania. Ceasefire|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Enormous pressure.  They would surely MUCH prefer to play the Italians in a small private room with no one watching|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: My first and only match on BBO was a disaster, it was against Belgium :(|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I would guess that they would be up for it. Lithuanians are a fiercely proud people |pg||
nt|bjacobs: This is a really complex position|pg||
nt|bjacobs: One possibility for Duboin is to ruff a club, then plan to discard a spade on the 4th club, then ruff a spade - finally the heart finesse|pg||
nt|bagman: he can discard one of the diamonds on the @SQ|pg||
nt|andyv:  E could see 10 tricks if @hs broke|pg||
nt|andyv:  now he has to decide how to tackle the @d and @c suits|pg||
nt|bagman: If trumps were 4-0, declarer needs some luck elsewhere|pg||
nt|bagman: He's safe to draw the last trump and establis a trick in clubs |pg||
nt|koksoy: he  may  try  ruffing 2  clubs|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer is afraid of having one of the diamond winners ruffed.|pg||
pc|d2|nt|bagman: Now declarer goes up and starts trumps|pg||
nt|bagman: no need to guess|pg||
nt|petergill: Usually it's better to set up the side suit first, on hands like this one in 5@HX|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Good afternoon to Paul Gipson|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|andyv:  when things go bad....|pg||
nt|hedyg: lol|pg||
nt|hedyg: Bocchi had no info|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, that too.|pg||
nt|andyv:  vul vs. none, you need about 42-44% chance of making game to bid it in mp.|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I am sorry, I lost the play here|pg||
nt|ziff:  Yes. Ruff two @Ds, cash 2 @S, throw in South with the last @C|pg||
pc|cT|nt|athene: yes, the multi allowed EW to say their piece at a lower level and then give up |pg||
nt|paulg:  Hi everyone|pg||
pc|c4|nt|bjacobs: Or even discard two spades on two clubs?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: An interesting expansion of the basic plan|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If it's true what you are saying, the Italians have an advantage when they buy a vugraph box for the entire tournament. Everyone is forced to play against them on vugraph|pg||
nt|mbruun: They have many advantages, the Vu-graph, their system, their cardplay. |pg||
nt|bjacobs: This play is fraught as well - if South is 3-3-4-3, he will eventually be able to overruff dummy|pg||
nt|mamos: yes setting up Clubs may be harder |pg||
pc|c7|nt|koksoy: that  is  @C A  and ruff  @H Q  THEN|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|hedyg: hmmm he might try to disc the @d now?|pg||
nt|petergill: East is endplayed after he ruffs the @D and has to accept 800 instead of 1100  - he will try a low club from his king |pg||
pc|d3|nt|tez: @d2 is suit pereferance|pg||
nt|bjacobs: She!  |pg||
nt|petergill: At the other table, Norberto Bocchi did not bid as boldly as Janis Ozols|pg||
nt|barnets: nice play|pg||
nt|barnets: gives north a dilemma|pg||
nt|petergill: Duboin, anticipating the endplay, works out that it's better to play a club from his side than to give partner the @d ruff. Classy, as long as it doesn't backfire.|pg||
nt|ziff:  Probably doesn t work, even, as everything is blocked afterwards|pg||
pc|d4|nt|Walddk2: An additional advantage then, as if they need more|pg||
nt|Gerben42: thats impressive bridging|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
nt|henryb:  He won't get within 100 yards of it unless he went at about 9AM|pg||
nt|hedyg: now @d finesse would have been netter|pg||
nt|hedyg: better even|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c3|nt|atabey: that italian imp could be fake :) I cant see a way for sementa to take 11 tricks on board 4|pg||
nt|andyv:  undertricks are going to be expensive|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: show of hands: who would have doubled with Madala's cards?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The smaller federations can't afford that |pg||
nt|koksoy: HÝ  Paul|pg||
pc|c2|nt|fabsayc: next|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|mbruun: See your point|pg||
nt|hedyg: not Duboin, no greed!|pg||
pc|cK|nt|petergill: I think it was better to pitch a @D there, not a spade|pg||
pc|c9|nt|bjacobs: So I think the whole hand gets down to the first point - you are going to need @HQ to drop doubleton|pg||
nt|mbruun: Two clublosers as expected|pg||
pc|c5|nt|andyv:  I wouldn't|pg||
nt|capercliff: well he does only live about 2 miles from the site now!|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|andyv:  sometimes the opps have their bids|pg||
nt|bagman: declarer hoping that if ruffed that would be from long trumps|pg||
nt|petergill: Format is - after 19 rounds, the top 9 in each Group survive, and carry forward 100% of their score against each of the 8 other qualifiers in their Group. They then play the nine ...|pg||
nt|petergill: qualifiers form the other Group to determine the winning team. The top 6 teams qualify for next year's Bermuda Bowl (WC) in Netherlands. |pg||
pc|cJ|nt|athene: lauria can afford the spade finesse now|pg||
nt|hedyg: and no risks|pg||
nt|brolucius: There was all the more reason for North to lead a heart, looking for a ruff, because the Italian auction had been confident - including some cue bids.|pg||
pc|h7|nt|Gerben42: he knows where @SA is so will duck|pg||

nt|bagman: Only worry now is 4-1 trumps|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|hedyg: that is the result announced by the players|pg||
nt|petergill: No, all Ok, will be 800|pg||
nt|bagman: Soon declarer plays a heart|pg||
nt|ziff:  Entries are not a problem. @DA, @SQ, but later @Ss and @Hs are blocked|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|sA|pc|s5|nt|koksoy: get  the  hearts then  play for the squeze  for an overtrick ( if  someone has 5 clubs & @SK)|pg||
pc|s4|nt|tez: right yalcin..it was 10 trick|pg||
nt|bagman: As Lauria had safe 10 tricks he did not risk the contract by trying for an overtrick by leaving a lurker trump at large|pg||
nt|andyv:  was it really safe?|pg||
nt|andyv:  could S have had a high @D?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Panayiotou called the TD because Lauria claimed to fast and didn't show his cards, he feels|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: too fast even|pg||
nt|bagman: IMO, yes 3 spades, 1 club 1 ruff ad 5 trumps|pg||
nt|bagman: Lauria can ruff a diamond and discard one on the @SQ|pg||
nt|bagman: then give away AQ of clubs|pg||

nt|hedyg: obviously cuebid|pg||
nt|henryb:  tough to find @d after this start|pg||
nt|hedyg: Fantoni would have opened 2@s :p|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Well judged, big swing to Norway|pg||
nt|rodvenn: well bid. can he find the spade q?|pg||
nt|hedyg: because he had a singleton in opps suit|pg||
nt|paulg:  it looks almost valueless in notrump|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: 2NT Ogust?|pg||
nt|hedyg: Magnusson playing in OR is also sort of Danish|pg||
nt|brolucius: Also the German football team has three Poles and a Brazilian... (I make my excuses in advance) |pg||
nt|athene: i am told 2@D in the other room was not a heart raise|pg||
nt|cicus: E a bit aggressive but the game is decent|pg||
nt|hedyg: 9@H was led in OR since E bid @cs|pg||
nt|gulyas: E has a very nice hand for just reopening|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: If it had been, the defender would have to surrender the contract, whether he rose with the ace or not.|pg||

nt|marlowepi: N hoping S has something like Axx of spades and short clubs|pg||
nt|marlowepi: agree he has a minimum 3S bid:)|pg||
nt|stc: anyway, in bridge you don't even need a to be citizen to represent a country...|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: MIght not be flat|pg||
nt|bagman: a heart now and declarer might settle for his 9 tops|pg||
nt|brolucius: If Slovakia finish in the bottom half of the table, Italy's (magnificent) score from this match will count for nothing. You only carry over your scores against qualifying teams.|pg||
nt|sharkey: this reminds me of when we got a WO in a Pairs tournament after 5 rounds - finally achieving a Plus round|pg||
nt|bagman: or S might duck the @HJ and get 10 tricks by setting up the clubs|pg||
nt|hedyg: they are 14th so far|pg||
nt|brolucius: Respectable with such a small population.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Anyway, if you are going to have a string of awful boards, best to group them together in just one match.|pg||
nt|mamos: North has been conservative too|pg||
nt|barnets: e/w can make  3@C here|pg||
nt|ziff:  Various kibitzers have improved on my line by drawing only two trump before playing the 3rd @S. This seems to work, but nobody plays that way without mirrors in the room|pg||
mb|3D|nt|jtr: Tactical decision maybe|pg||
nt|henryb:  need to lead a club|pg||
nt|capercliff: is that what the double was for?|pg||
nt|pasker: S had to be careful to hold up the C!A|pg||
nt|bagman: If south can refrain from playing a red card, this goes down|pg||
nt|bagman: There's only 2 discards on the clubs; declarer has a diamond loser letf|pg||
nt|pasker: oh yes sorry|pg||
nt|hedyg: Versace could have bid 3NT|pg||

nt|Walddk2: No service|pg||
mb|p|nt|daman: should have a suit pref for Ss|pg||

nt|andyv:  louder, Steve|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: lol|pg||
nt|bagman: Duck and 1 IMP to Italy|pg||
nt|bagman: Take and then either flat or 2 IMPs to Italy|pg||
nt|bagman: Do Italians play Smith?|pg||
nt|brolucius: And of course we all remember how Iceland became world champions (and heroes for life) by winning the world championship for a country with a very small population.|pg||
nt|bagman: E played @C2 to trick 2|pg||

pc|hA|nt|brgpro: well, he has 4@s as well,....so, opps can't have a cheap contract here|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Spain-Belgium must be playing football instead of bridge. The score is 1-0 after 5 boards|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|brolucius: North would rarely lead the @HA from a combination such as A-Q-x, but here the bidding had suggested that neither East nor West held a heart control.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: No, just a permanent resident for some time|pg||
nt|cicus: I expected E to try some club ruffs|pg||
nt|hedyg: once pd showed the rounded suits..|pg||

pc|c2|nt|iceblue: How do you think about this 3@C? Jack|pg||
nt|atabey: would be a good auction if K of @h was offside with a @d lead|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@H over 2@H would show a stronger hand|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: nightmare time for EW, for sure, these few boards|pg||
nt|mbruun: Looks like a quick push|pg||
nt|capercliff: not sure even a @c lead would beat it tho?|pg||
nt|snetram:  co powinno pokazywaÄ renons|pg||

nt|stc: and, as in the case of Madala you may play for different countries|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|brgpro: normal|pg||
nt|brolucius: West did hold a singleton heart, in fact, but chose not to cue-bid it because of the general minimum nature of his hand.|pg||
nt|bagman: South needs to return a club after taking the @CA|pg||
nt|petergill: Yes, there's a lack of entries to dummy|pg||
nt|paulg:  everyone playing double dummy now|pg||
pc|c6|pg||

nt|paulg:  Piper's 3NT was some bid by a passed hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Hey Harmon|pg||
nt|hedyg: hi Harmon :)|pg||
nt|henryb:  easily: defense sets up two clubs to go with 2@h and the @dA|pg||
nt|capercliff: yes sry 2@c'c, 2@h's and a @d|pg||
nt|henryb:  I have to leave you for Chicago|pg||
nt|hedyg: bye Henry, ty|pg||
nt|paulg:  i guess Piper knows that North will probably hold a couple of diamonds, as he did not use the 2@H opener (three suits, short in diamonds)|pg||
nt|capercliff: cu Henry, thanks|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Awww Henry|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Thanks Henry, enjoy :)|pg||
nt|paulg:  Piper/Wilkinson have an excellent attitude and memories like goldfish ... a bad score never fazes them|pg||
nt|bagman: ducking twice is fatal|pg||
nt|bagman: Time to count decarer's tricks|pg||
nt|andyv:  his choices would appear limited... either a club or a club or a club|pg||
nt|bagman: Nothing to do if partner hasn't go a trump trick|pg||
nt|brolucius: You can measure the strength of a bridge player by counting the countries in the world that would welcome the player into their national team.|pg||
nt|athene: east will surely hope for the @CQ onside|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c8|nt|Walddk2: 2NT asking, 3NT= 15+ 5-2-4-2 or 5-3-4-1|pg||

pc|c9|pg||
nt|brgpro: i would bid 1@h and, if necessary, bid 2@H again|pg||
pc|c5|nt|brgpro: but what is important: after 2/1, 3 level new suit better be 5|pg||
nt|lesniak: na 100% pytanie tylko czy pokazuje renons czy tez pyta o asy z wylaczeniem|pg||
nt|sybarra: wonderful system |pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: OK, someting is terribly wrong here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: but even with 4 card majors 1S is somewhat questionable, and the double a bit more so holding 3 clubs |pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Declarer ran the hearts then played a small @S|pg||
nt|babs59: regarding last board, many people move with 8 HCP opposite a 15-17 NT|pg||
pc|cT|nt|bagman: Now Sementa needs to dicard the clubs and see what happens|pg||
nt|brolucius: The Smith peter is a signal, normally used only in no-trumps. You play high or low on declarer's first suit (when a count signal is not needed) to say something about how much you ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: like the opening lead.|pg||

nt|capercliff: he will claim|pg||
nt|stc: Zia also played at first for Pakistan :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  in imps more will move than mps|pg||
nt|petergill: The club ruff is with the trump winner, 110|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|babs59: I tend not to unless a decent 5 card suit...  applying a Jim Borin 'law'|pg||
pc|h3|nt|bagman: I would guess that declarer cashes out now instead of trying to be a hero|pg||
nt|lesniak: zagranie 9 pik przez Cezarego bylo doskonale|pg||
nt|babs59: which was not to move when the MAXIMUM was the min. you needed for game|pg||
pc|h5|nt|brgpro: if not max, then better be concentrated suits|pg||
nt|Gerben42: @H10 will still be lost, so 80|pg||
nt|koksoy: he  can  do  nothing ...  500|pg||
nt|paulg:  two down and -500, i guess everyone reasonably happy|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|andyv:  just not counting |pg||
nt|cicus: this is an easy hand, it goes down anyway :)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|rodvenn: everybody knows this is about the spade q|pg||
pc|dK|nt|brolucius: There is a general consensus that you should always cue-bid an ace, provided it does not raise the level of the contract. With a second-round control, you can take a view and ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: decline to cue-bid if you are not suitable for a slam. |pg||
nt|Walddk4: Why would you not be suitable for slam with five controls?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Indeed. I would have bid 4@H.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Particularly as East had not bid that suit.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: I am asked about controls. The ace is worth two, the king one control|pg||
nt|Walddk4: So AAK = five|pg||
nt|brolucius: It's a slight problem with auctions that have become game-forcing. The needs to cue-bid controls and to show slam suitability clash somewhat.|pg||
nt|bagman: Pressure|pg||
nt|koksoy: 4@H  need  some  effort|pg||
pc|d5|nt|bagman: Sementa is probably especially happy because defending at 2 level with void vs Q9xxx is always quite risky|pg||
nt|koksoy: and  3nt  is  lay down|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|brolucius: He felt a bit guilty at switching and asked the US team to wear Pakistani costume on one occasion.|pg||

nt|Walddk2: So 13 IMPs to Norway on board 6|pg||
nt|rodvenn: if East had had the spade q, he would have bid more strongly|pg||
nt|bagman: This looks like a flat 4@H with an overtrick|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: After 7 compared boards a 60 IMP lead would be 25-0 with 9 IMPs to spare|pg||
nt|sybarra: do we have the right bd?|pg||
nt|mamos: i think North is worth 3@h if South had rebid 2@D so not quite sure what has happened here|pg||
nt|iain sime: Italy were losing 12 imps anyway so the lead only cost two more.|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I think, by David's measure, Zia must be the best player in the world, for who wouldn't want him on their team?|pg||
nt|brolucius: A diamond lead seems to look right from that East hand.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, he would pick up the whole world.|pg||

mb|p|nt|brolucius: Some would bid 3@H, a mini-splinter (which would give South much more information).|pg||
nt|atabey: T/O and goodish|pg||
nt|othered1: A possible line on last h and is to cash @HA then try to get @D discard on 4th @S.  I don't think that's best, however.|pg||
nt|tez: kandemir led @d at the other table..interesting now|pg||
nt|daman: will probably end up in 4@Hs on this|pg||
nt|andyv:  probably with good reason|pg||
nt|cicus: I'm waiting for that opportunity|pg||
nt|gulyas: unless its mp scoring, where anything goes|pg||
nt|hedyg: A@H and small @D?|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can easily win the top two trumps and crossruff in diamonds and spades|pg||
nt|skorchev: hi all|pg||
nt|mdgraham: when people open with 10 and respond with 3 you sometimes need a natural NT bid|pg||
nt|ziff:  Would be a lot easier if he were either weaker or stronger|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|kiwi_joker: hope no-one asks "is this a lebensohl situation?"|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: lol|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: COZ IT AINT!|pg||
nt|andyv:  only time i play it if we jump to game is when we are vul and opps aren't|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Teehee|pg||
nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
nt|andyv:  http://bit.ly/cLqzVV|pg||
nt|capercliff: if he went up with the K then they need to give him 10 tricks?|pg||
nt|bagman: It is possible that E leads a club and then a spade back forces declarer to go up|pg||
nt|bagman: He'll do fine with a diamond lead|pg||
nt|bagman: It's hard to locate a weakness in partner's 4 card suit|pg||
nt|andyv:  a lot riding on the opening lead|pg||
nt|pasker: true lauria might not lead a @S|pg||
nt|brolucius: Take-out double a good move from West - suggests spades but does not go past 3@H.|pg||
nt|petergill: 5@D plays better than 3NT|pg||
nt|barnets: not so safe|pg||
nt|barnets: with bad club break|pg||
mb|p|nt|othered1: assuming @D lead, of course|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Huge opportunity here|pg||
nt|hedyg: except if he claims 9, yes|pg||
nt|hedyg: then it is his problem|pg||
nt|capercliff: hmm, 1@s not forcing here?|pg||
nt|bagman: does not force as he might have a heart loser|pg||
nt|bagman: so even in that case declarer takes the spade finesse|pg||
nt|sybarra: I see 8 tricks |pg||
nt|mamos: yes|pg||
nt|marlowepi: we will continue to see that number:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: until we see 7|pg||
nt|marlowepi: heart finesse|pg||
nt|cicus: look, Barczy is not afraid of being shot, and it earns hime some IMPs|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: That would show no more than a raise to 3@S that included at most one heart.|pg||
nt|brolucius: I suffered the connection problems that I mentioned 45 minutes ago. Obviously the exorbitant £17.99 that I pay for Boardband each month is not considered sufficient for a good ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: service.|pg||
nt|brgpro: i know for sure that had N bid 3@s, S would have raised to 4, playing the principle of 5-8|pg||
nt|jtr: Entries to play @ss are a problem here|pg||
nt|brgpro: but after 3@H, he has only 3...|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: Principle of 5-8?|pg||
nt|brgpro: used to be called principle of 7|pg||
nt|Walddk5: Welcome Stefan|pg||
nt|fabsayc: i like 3h as forcing spade raise|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Heya Stefan|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Stefan|pg||
nt|fabsayc: the idea is to offer a choice between 3nt and 4s|pg||
pc|d9|nt|iceblue: Zhou doest think it is 16HCP since of the stiff @HQ|pg||
nt|stc: 3@s(170) better the 5@dx-1 !|pg||
nt|stc: or even 140|pg||
nt|iain sime: Or minus 400 (3NT if a club lead)|pg||
nt|hedyg: in the mean time 10 more imps to Italy|pg||
nt|athene: with no overruff possible, he will end up making nine tricks|pg||
nt|skorchev: 3@H by South is either slam interest with @S fit or @S fit, balanced fit, intending to play 3nt/4@S|pg||
nt|skorchev: *balanced hand|pg||
nt|fabsayc: you can use this idea over a 1NT opening|pg||
nt|bagman: Sementa has goodish spade intermediates and a fitting Q + singleton|pg||
nt|paulg:  from what I've seen, it is wrong to describe any Duboin as invitational ... it is just a transfer for Sementa to bid game|pg||
nt|koksoy: :)|pg||
pc|d7|nt|hedyg: nice selfcontrol by Assael|pg||
nt|hedyg: anyhow isn't it more likely he plays a @d back?|pg||
nt|bagman: yes|pg||
nt|hedyg: where 4@s was bid and made|pg||
nt|hedyg: on bd 7|pg||
nt|bagman: Sementa might duck this to keep multiple options|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Girls need a deck of cards... A @H to love a man, a @D to marry him, a @C to whack him in the head and a @S to bury him|pg||
nt|babs59: I hadn't heard that one before!|pg||
nt|mdgraham: double smacks of bidding his hand twice imho |pg||
pc|dA|nt|mbruun: Gutsy play|pg||
nt|paulg:  their CC does not say that 1@s is non-forcing|pg||
nt|capercliff: maybe they play it as limited|pg||
nt|athene: even though he sort of has 3 clubs, trump, diamond to lose|pg||
nt|athene: he will take nine tricks first and leave the defence to make a trump and a side-suit winner at the same time|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: http://tinyurl.com/ebc-open-b   http://tinyurl.com/ebc-open-a   http://tinyurl.com/3yl8spu (women)   http://tinyurl.com/39bvxwu (seniors)  for running Euro scores, courtesy of ...|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Roland Wald|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|brolucius: Indeed. It is quite a modest opening bid - not so close to a strong 1@C.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, but 5-8 is more impressive.|pg||
nt|brgpro: always play pd for 5-8 HCP in these kind of auction...|pg||
nt|jtr: He wisely played them immediately|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: lol, unfamiliar with both of them :)|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: Oh, right|pg||
nt|brgpro: Berry Westra thought 5-8 is more likely:)|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: What's that based on then?|pg||
nt|jtr: Experience?|pg||
nt|brgpro: probability...although i dont know a bit of it:)|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: Haha, experience and probability are neighbours, aren't they? :)|pg||
nt|bagman: no|pg||
nt|andyv:  will N try to sneak a @h now?|pg||
nt|andyv:  not anymore|pg||
nt|jkotor: szansa na -2?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: :)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|brgpro: yes, just like u and me! |pg||
nt|andyv:  for running scores|pg||
nt|bagman: :)|pg||
nt|barnets: this rates to be down|pg||
nt|bagman: No the defense has to commit to some line|pg||
nt|bagman: they can draw trumps to prevent the diamond ruffs but then Sementa can set up the hearts|pg||
nt|koksoy: if  defence  can  able to  play  3rd diamond ..  then  they  may  have 2spade heart and  dimond|pg||
nt|paulg:  he is a little short of entries to do everything though|pg||
nt|koksoy: diamond  now|pg||
pc|hK|nt|paulg:  and even if it did, i would raise|pg||
nt|xenya: somewhat unlucky for Norway -- 5@D is a sensible contract|pg||
nt|hedyg: lolllllll famous last words|pg||
nt|petergill: South needs to retain his @D entry to the long spades|pg||
nt|snetram:  powinno byÄ bez dwÃ³ch, ale Cezary bedzie w lekkim przymusie po ÅciÄgniÄciu pikÃ³w. Tylko wskoczenie asem trefl i zagranie w karo uwalnia go od tego|pg||
nt|bagman: A diamond continuation leaves Sementa quite badly placed in Dummy|pg||
pc|hA|nt|gulyas: with Dumbovich in the driving seat, I would not be surprised at all:)|pg||
nt|gulyas: sry, its Gotthard|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|daman: this probably requires careful play     ergo the delay|pg||
nt|daman: USA  and England won their soccer matches|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: So Algeria and Slovakia are out of the Football World Cup? :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Sorry George, couldn't resist :)|pg||
nt|daman: I believe so|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I am being told Slovenia|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I was just testing George kibs :) Haha|pg||
nt|bagman: NS have probably promised both majors and clubs as the trick suit|pg||
nt|andyv:  nice method|pg||
nt|fabsayc: see my website for an explanation of this idea|pg||
nt|petergill: Making 3@S requires good guessing in @h and @C|pg||
pc|h4|nt|fabsayc: under 50%|pg||
nt|Gerben42: it was a part of the Romex system, designed by Mexican top player George Rosenkrantz|pg||
nt|petergill: when a @D is led towards dummy, South needs to duck. Is this hard?|pg||
nt|lesniak: tak|pg||
nt|paulg:  if he ruffed two diamonds, then he'd need the club finesse for a heart pitch and doesn't have the entries for that ....|pg||
nt|paulg:  unless the defence helps!|pg||
nt|koksoy: now  he  may  crossruff|pg||
nt|bagman: This was helpful; now he can afford to ruff the diamonds |pg||
pc|h8|nt|mbruun: Looks like a minirally of 1 IMP|pg||
nt|paulg:  i wonder if Wilkinson misread the auction and thought that East bid it|pg||
nt|bagman: now the rest is easy|pg||
nt|barnets: same contract same lead in the open|pg||
nt|babs59: entries are interesting this hand|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|andyv:  finally a calm board for Lebanon|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Maybe the 3 was attitude?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: When there are imps to be won, you have to go for it|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer did consider rising with the @SA... for about 0.0001 milliseconds.|pg||
nt|cicus: still no surprise|pg||
nt|gulyas: :)|pg||

nt|hedyg: claim|pg||
nt|jkotor: Adam lavinthalowa³ trefle, wiêc jest na to czas|pg||

nt|hedyg: 3@H asked for a @H stopper|pg||
nt|bagman: Logical to lead a diamond|pg||
nt|vasmar: a potential plus for Cyprus|pg||
nt|petergill: Moment of truth|pg||
nt|petergill: Playing the opening bidder for @HA was reasonable but unlucky|pg||
pc|d5|nt|iain sime: Not sure about this line. the heart king was an entry.|pg||
nt|petergill: Very difficult play for South|pg||
nt|snetram:  jak powiedzieliÅmy, tak zrobiÅ|pg||
nt|babs59: even with a 'helpful' lead|pg||
pc|d8|nt|bagman: I guess that this will played to the end|pg||
nt|andyv:  if Versace had somehow found a way to duck the @d, it would have put a lot of pressure on N|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|daman: for interested parties    http://www.cbc.ca/sports/soccer/fifaworldcup/features/story/2010/06/19/sp-wc-tiebreakers.html|pg||
nt|gulyas: crossruff time|pg||
nt|ziff:  That s what I meant with difficult, you want to bid only once, but the hand is very good if you hit a fit. If  not....|pg||
pc|sA|nt|brgpro: after E has shown 3@s, he knows the @h aren't breaking....well, actually he hopes they wont break...|pg||
nt|lesniak: Adam - bo on chyba siedzi na E|pg||

nt|hedyg: ahhhhh ok ty Bas|pg||

nt|snetram:  ale wymagaÅo koncentracji|pg||
nt|lesniak: tak|pg||
pc|s7|nt|pasker: as pointed out by spec the 9@S is going to be good enough on a @S lead|pg||
nt|bagman: Ducking would have been double dummy play; imagine partner with AJxx(x)|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|brgpro: that would be a quick one down, even without @h ruffs|pg||
nt|mamos: hoping for some clues or helpful discards|pg||
pc|cK|nt|brolucius: Declarer must be careful now in the trump suit. Yes, well played!|pg||
nt|mamos: pretty sure @H finesse is wrong now|pg||
nt|sybarra: yes too many @H's discards from W |pg||
nt|Gerben42: this will also test Madala|pg||
nt|petergill: Will be interesting to see what Madala does at other table|pg||
nt|petergill: Very tough play - the sort of play that the champions often find|pg||
nt|barnets: in the open declarer played a @D from hand at trcik 2 better I think and madala made a fine play of ducking his K|pg||
nt|petergill: Agustin Madala ducked, I am told|pg||
pc|cA|nt|athene: declarer had no chance to set up the spades|pg||
nt|athene: as dummy was short of entries|pg||
nt|athene: but now he is running seriously short of tricks|pg||
nt|athene: even though west only has two obvious winners (@CA, trump)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: now 8, not 7|pg||
nt|marlowepi: W held his diamonds because N might have had diamond ace instead of heart ace|pg||
nt|marlowepi: N still has the chance of a defensive error earlier, i.e. E failing to unl;ock spade ten from QTxx|pg||
nt|marlowepi: then a diamond exit would see him home|pg||
pc|c6|nt|andyv:  yes...Lauria would have had to lead something other than the 5@d to give Versace a chance to duck|pg||
nt|vasmar: this is a disadvantage of leading low from 10xxx|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
pc|d2|nt|mamos: east not thinking???|pg||
nt|brolucius: He can give up a club for 9 tricks.|pg||
nt|hedyg: best play @s now and give 1@c|pg||
nt|hedyg: sry David|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jkotor: Ha! Szwedzi jednak graj¹, ¿e 2@h/@s po 2@c = F1 (wg KKonw)|pg||
nt|andyv:  E has to be careful not to be endplayed|pg||
nt|babs59: for a while Italy was staying out of trouble on board 5, South holding 5@S and 7@D, but South bid again over 4@H - final contract is 5@DX|pg||
nt|andyv:  that won't be pretty either|pg||
nt|andyv:  that should go down 3|pg||

nt|athene: but a pre-empt can do that to you|pg||
nt|athene: one area of the game where i am sure most pairs don't have enough methods is after a 3nt overcall of a pre-empt|pg||
nt|gulyas: 4@S makes more tricks - in fact, you  have to guess @Ss to to make 3NT at all|pg||
nt|athene: it can cover such a wide range of shapes and strengths, you need a lot of kit to investigate the best game or slam|pg||
nt|jkotor: mo¿na te¿ powiedzieæ, ¿e bardzo ³adne rozdanie Szwedów|pg||
nt|lesniak: rozgrywk¹|pg||
mb|4S|nt|Walddk4: Spades and a minor, 5-5|pg||
nt|petergill: which makes East about a 9/17 chance of having @HA in my opinion, so it was a close guess in @H|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  probably need a @c lead to stop 4@s|pg||
nt|bjacobs: German term|pg||
nt|petergill: Possibly, but at Trick 2 it seems natural to duck to retain your entry. At Trick 4, perhaps it seemed less clear?|pg||
nt|athene: 2@H rather than 3@H makes things much easier|pg||
nt|athene: now transfer and west will do something very enthusiastic|pg||
nt|athene: to show his monster support for spades|pg||
nt|gulyas: 6@S makes with good guesses, not likely to be bid tho|pg||

nt|bagman: Difficult situation. 5m can go down a lot and there was no guarantees that 4@H makes|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: South correctly makes no move towards game. He expects that the deal is a mis-fit and his hearts will pull little weight with spades as trumps.|pg||

nt|Walddk2: 3@S is the limit and even that is not cold|pg||
nt|bagman: NS can make 5@C|pg||
nt|paulg:  3@d looks like a mixed raise in spades|pg||
nt|paulg:  so 4-card support plus a good card or two|pg||
nt|bagman: Denning has more or less shown only his range without much info about his shape|pg||
nt|paulg:  Denning might bid four or five diamonds|pg||
nt|bagman: Now it's quite hard to recover from the start|pg||
nt|paulg:  i think 5@d |pg||
nt|paulg:  three major suit cards, fit with partner, excellent suit|pg||
pc|hK|nt|daman: tah dah|pg||
nt|bagman: They have loaded quite a lot into 1@D opening as their 2@C opening shows 6 or more|pg||
pc|h2|nt|iceblue: 2NT shud be Lebensohl|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3NT?|pg||
nt|sybarra: does S pass?|pg||
nt|hedyg: not sure Versace was bidding 4@H freely|pg||
nt|hedyg: E bid 2@C in OR|pg||
nt|sharkey: Madala did not have a good match earlier today vs Norway but sure has reddemed himself in this match|pg||
nt|hedyg: and S doubled to show a good hand|pg||
nt|bagman: N might not make a move nv|pg||
nt|hedyg: Italy won 21:9 vs Norway|pg||
nt|hedyg: that looks pretty good to me|pg||
nt|brolucius: Incredible that the Italians should actually make two cue-bids on such values. Do they see a potential slam on every deal?|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes - cud have been much more...|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4 VPs more?|pg||
nt|bagman: W should not bid to sac but to make (on this vulnerability)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: But declarer can overtake spades when the 10 falls and should be OK in 3|pg||

nt|Walddk2: South had no choice|pg||
nt|mdgraham: why 3@C facing a partner who passed 1@S?|pg||

nt|koksoy: 4nt  ?  now  to  choose  a  minor|pg||
nt|koksoy: he  thinks  wh  has  hearts?|pg||
nt|bagman: The problem with 4NT is that W gets a freeroll to X|pg||
pc|sK|nt|brolucius: A direct 3@H would show values, so West travels via a Lebensohl 2NT to show a weak hand with hearts.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muiderberg_convention|pg||
nt|athene: leads a top spade to see which red suit to attack|pg||
nt|daman: 9 toppers   may be room for an overtrick |pg||
nt|capercliff: we all need to remember that the play is very fast at this table, hard for the operator to keep up sometimes|pg||
nt|hedyg: Bas is doing fine :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: bd 8 Swiss played 5@DX= for 12 imps|pg||
nt|iain sime: Should manage six trump, two clubs and a diamond.|pg||
nt|athene: ok - now it's harder :) |pg||
nt|cicus: this won't make declarer sweat|pg||
nt|athene: short of putting the stop card down and bidding 4@S, west can't really superaccept now unless he wants to risk the 5-level, which he really can't|pg||
nt|hedyg: 12 tricks are there|pg||
pc|sA|nt|brolucius: 2@C is game-forcing balanced or diamond support.|pg||
nt|brgpro: they are on they way...with a lot of relays i think...although we dont really know their agreements|pg||
nt|atabey: on board 7 the lead to 6@h was a dia. declarer didnt take the @h finess. however he could pitch the @d's to @c ace and the 4th @s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Madala's 1NT backfired in the other room|pg||
nt|sharkey: in VP no - IMPs yes :)|pg||
nt|bagman: Now N has values to do something|pg||
nt|hedyg: David when your pd shows a strong hand an ace, a king and Qx in pds suit is not a lot?|pg||
nt|bagman: X or 3@S|pg||
nt|bagman: depending on agreements on X|pg||
nt|lesniak: dobrze wykonane|pg||
nt|bagman: S had already shown a fine @D suit. Now it was time to show some support for partner|pg||
pc|s6|nt|dougdscsu: Bas is god|pg||
nt|hedyg: oh my|pg||
nt|mamos: 3Nt coming|pg||
nt|marlowepi: for most of us, not an appetizing approach to describing the E hand|pg||
nt|sybarra: this is played from the other side |pg||
nt|andyv:  10 more imps for Bulgaria is Italy stopped at 3@d on board 5|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|brgpro: my guess is: 2@d=extra length or Bal. min. and 2@h asked which, 2@s showed the later|pg||
nt|brolucius: An initial response of 3@C would be 8-11 natural.|pg||
nt|jtr: It needs very specific cards facing a weak NT which i imagine Bocchi has shown by now|pg||
nt|jtr: Madala is maybe just looking for the best game|pg||
nt|brolucius: It would be quite a system triumph to identify that you were CLOSE to a slam. |pg||
nt|brgpro: the perfect card S can find is: xx  KQx xxxxx Akx|pg||
nt|brolucius: xx/Axxx/AKx/Qxxx also good.|pg||
nt|brgpro: that isn't that min....he might rebid 2NT with that|pg||
nt|brgpro: now he is on the corss road...go beyond 3NT or not...|pg||
nt|jtr: I imagine 2@d showed the weak NT with 2NT showing something else  Common methods which i myself use|pg||
nt|brolucius: The convention card says 2NT rebid is 12-14 balanced but may not be bid with x-x in a suit. Here he has a low doubleton spade.|pg||
nt|jtr: I cant see that David|pg||
nt|brgpro: so 2NT asked his weakness and 3@s showed it?|pg||
nt|brolucius: At the end of the notes - last section.|pg||
nt|jtr: ah!|pg||
nt|jtr: Wow you are efficient!|pg||
nt|brolucius: In fact 2NT rebid is 11-14 balanced, with no low doubleton.|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am spurred into action by the presence of top-class commentators alongside.|pg||
nt|hedyg: lucky to find K@H with 3 @ss|pg||
nt|atabey: so it was unbeatable afterall. the lead didnt matter|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: Fayad values the hand as stronger than Versace did in othr room .. but they still stop short of game|pg||
nt|capercliff: maybe its Lauria's turn to only claim 10?:)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: esp when opps can bid spades, highly likely when u r short there, your main suit can get buried|pg||
nt|mamos: no double because it asked for a spade nd here Spade holder on lead|pg||
nt|sybarra: but he found the lead |pg||
nt|Gerben42: only the best graduate from the Blue Team bridge school|pg||
nt|barnets: well clearly north likes to bid a lot|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Some play XX here instead of 3@H has an invite to 4@H so that 3@H can be used for competition, or just push opps out|pg||

nt|brgpro: finally he dicided to cross the boarder|pg||
nt|jtr: Ah of course, they cant have 18-19 balanced|pg||
nt|sharkey: The way this match is going may also influence NS bidding here|pg||
nt|andyv:  I don't think EW need to speculate|pg||
nt|petergill: Janis Ozols likes to compete, as we saw earlier on a hand that cost 5 imps|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: EW amazed at dummy|pg||
nt|gulyas: this another 2 imps to HUN, regardless of making 5 or 6|pg||
pc|c4|nt|Walddk2: A Gazzilli sequence got them to the 3-level|pg||
nt|Walddk2: was impossible for Madala to stop short after that|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|bagman: Here Sementa is unlikely to drop the @CK|pg||
nt|hedyg: J@H works well here|pg||
nt|skorchev: Bulgaria won 10 imps in board 5, since Madala-Bocchi stopped at 3@D+2 ... (5@D= was played here)|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|jtr: They open 2@c with that|pg||
nt|brgpro: i think 4NT shows odd number of key cards....i played a lot of Italian pairs, still dont quite understand their turbo method|pg||
nt|brolucius: If anyone bid and made 6@D against me on these cards, I would think that I was not destined to win the match.|pg||
nt|hedyg: lets try not to exaggerate :)|pg||
nt|sharkey: wudnt bet on it....:)|pg||
nt|bagman: If he ever gets to dummy|pg||
nt|sybarra: I would hard pressed to find a low sp lead from the N holding |pg||
nt|petergill: He is a passed hand, so he knew if partner passed the Dbl that it would be OK|pg||
nt|barnets: not surprised|pg||
nt|snetram:  ale zagrania dwa razy atu- poÅÄczone z impasem - wygrywa|pg||
nt|koksoy: @S R lead  overtaken by  A  and  diamond  ...  now??  decision  time|pg||
nt|bagman: South might guess this; the defense would have played 2 rounds of spades if there was need for @D finesse|pg||
pc|h6|pc|s7|nt|bagman: he might be forced to|pg||

nt|brolucius: Yes, it's not a bad slam particularly but difficult to bid, as you said earlier.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: http://psbridge.gotdns.com/bbo/allvug/  - Vugraph Hand Records (PDF)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: lol thanks all (and Doug)|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: It was actually (again!) someone coming in for the BM|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I should just gag them...|pg||
nt|bagman: Now @H + spade guarantees set if E has Qxx of diamonds|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|brolucius: If you don't play a two-suited 2@S, then many would open a normal weak 2@S on that North hand.|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Correction, the minor can be four cards only|pg||
nt|brolucius: Anyway, it seems that they had a splendid investigative auction and decided, very reasonably, to stay out of it.|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: In Pairs it might've been easier, raising 5@D to 6@D because it's bad score anyway :)|pg||
nt|daman: he need to play a @S or a @D|pg||
pc|s5|nt|daman: s|pg||
nt|athene: declarer can be pretty sure the @DA is right|pg||
nt|hedyg: S thought pd had singleton @S not to raise to 3@s|pg||
pc|s8|nt|bagman: Sementa probably reasoned that N must have the @CK to pass|pg||
nt|sharkey: still need to locate a few honors yet so too early to play for drop|pg||
nt|bagman: And so far, he really cannot draw inferences from the nyances in S's defensive play|pg||

nt|babs59: I would have thought West would continue the trump attack|pg||
pc|d2|nt|daman: yes|pg||
nt|athene: firstly @SAK @DA is 1@S not 2@S|pg||
pc|d6|nt|atabey: kolata did not dbl 2@h. which I believe was a better move. and he earned 5 imps|pg||
nt|athene: secondly with the @DA north would be more likely to just clear the spades|pg||
nt|rodvenn: the 6 points on 5 is also well deserved to Italy, but the 10imps on 1 is slightly lucky|pg||

nt|bagman: West cannot believe that S has Axx of clubs|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|bagman: Technically and in isolation, declarer should have lead @HJ to pick up KTx onside. Here, however, the @HJ was needed to guard against diamond overruf|pg||
nt|marlowepi: once W bids the suit you have to lead a low one at IMPs|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c2|nt|hedyg: and a @c back|pg||
nt|brolucius: After a club lead (against that 5@D doubled), declarer simply drew trumps and set up a club winner in the South hand to pitch the spade loser from dummy.|pg||
nt|paulg:  not an easy situation to read|pg||
pc|c3|nt|athene: ok, he isn't risking the contract for an overtrick|pg||
nt|athene: fair enough|pg||
nt|hedyg: why not K@H before @s finesse?|pg||
nt|gulyas: just plain Dumbovich, getting everything right|pg||
nt|ziff:  More or less the same defence at both tables|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Declarer took a finesse from dummy, but I have no clue how...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: too unlikely that partner has 2 tricks of his own|pg||

nt|andyv:  lol|pg||

nt|athene: this was west's 4@S, i presume|pg||
nt|bjacobs: As a passed hand, I think you are worth 2@S|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3@D also possible, but the spades look good|pg||
nt|mbruun: You just turned 20 last week. Youre getting more sensible on your older days|pg||
nt|mdgraham: after all, they are solid|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Partner usually has 4 spades when he doubles 1@H, but not always as we see|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In an ideal world he has|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Still, this 4-3 fit is fairly harmless.  And if partner has extras, he will bid, and I can show my heart stopper next|pg||
nt|bjacobs: North thinking here is an overbid|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it's not an ideal world, even though it's the only one we've got|pg||
nt|mbruun: I dont think you should interfer over 1 H with the North hand after partner passed. Game is highly unlikely, and partner can still bidd with good distibution|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Wow|pg||
nt|sybarra: I would 1 @S  but my better suit is @D's here |pg||
nt|mbruun: I just turned 21 yesterday|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Minimum|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@D asking for shortage I believe, not sure|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: With NS overcalling style, the S hand would be considered a maximum, right?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: well not a minimum for sure|pg||
nt|bagman: S hoping that the @HK is with length|pg||

nt|daman: yes|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Serbia leading Italy by 24 with 9 compared boards, who would've though|pg||
nt|athene: despite common claims that it can't be better to allow opps so much more room|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that never stopped the Italians, and it doesn't seem to do them any harm |pg||
nt|rodvenn: also the board 8 shows better judgement and system by the Italians. |pg||
nt|sharkey: Slovakia off the Schneider??|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, 1NT looks OK.|pg||
nt|sharkey: 1 NT by N may be an alternative as well|pg||

nt|marlowepi: spade natural lead|pg||
nt|brolucius: 5@D was the obvious move if South does decide to advance.|pg||

nt|capercliff: well it will be positive for Italy anyway|pg||
nt|brolucius: Good gracious. Is that 1@S contract over already?!|pg||
nt|sharkey: Going into 2nd half on an upbeat note :)|pg||
nt|bagman: This looks like a flat 450 at both tables :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Slovakia need to pick up another 11 IMPs to make a dent in the maximum VP defeat. |pg||
nt|bagman: He was probably happy to have to guess only for the overtrick|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Strange, everyone says -1 but I'm sure the play went as it went...|pg||
nt|hedyg: then he is down immediately|pg||
nt|Walddk2: I don't think so, Constantin|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is part of the odds of bidding such slams (and well done for bidding it) that the defenders may not be card perfect. It was a tricky one for East.|pg||
nt|stc: E must play @s|pg||
nt|iain sime: Win the lead and play all the trumps would have worked.|pg||
nt|stc: if he ducks the @d E must play @s to beat|pg||
nt|brolucius: East had no idea at all how the diamond suit lay.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It won't help East to come down to 2 spades, 1 diamond and 3 clubs. Then declarer can ruff out the clubs|pg||
nt|Walddk2: There was a legitimate line |pg||
nt|Walddk2: But a little easier for us|pg||
nt|petergill: South had 2 losing choices, give partner a ruff and miss out on @D tricks, or takes winners. He chose the latter|pg||
nt|petergill: Half time, and Latvia are holding the mighty Italy well |pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: In Namyats, wouldn't this be a 4@D opening?|pg||
nt|andyv:  it would except that the hand was pretty weak in hcp|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I'd probably open 1@S and rebid 4@S, showing a really good suit with too much on the side to open 4@S|pg||

mb|p|nt|jtr: So you werent tempted to venture some of your 'hard' earned dosh?:)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 3nt overcall?|pg||
nt|jbgood: multi, 2@s would have shown 8-11 hcp and 6 cards|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 4S easier to make than to bid|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 4@S is one too high, though|pg||
nt|andyv:  a very strong NT|pg||
nt|paulg:  Denning with a Meckwell-style 1@d opener, is there a worse 11 points?|pg||
nt|andyv:  but you are right...4@s would show about 7 tricks and 4@d (namyats) would show about 7.5 to 8 tricks|pg||
nt|babs59: some believe Namyats should have more control of outside suits than that hand - eg singleton in one of the 'less stopped' suits|pg||
mb|1H|nt|gulyas: as I said before so many times, a likely push:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|brgpro: i dont mind opeing 3@d with the S cards although we were taught not to do so|pg||
nt|daman: if they can get there|pg||
nt|rodvenn: or on board 8 a misundeerstanding: the double of the 2@S splinter bid howed spades. But Svendsen seem tu have thought it was an OD, showing hearts|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Hoftaniska asked me to call the TD|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Not sure what it was all about|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: He seemed to want Bocchi to tell the TD what he told him. The TD just told Hofta to stop...|pg||
nt|bagman: I've been wrong before, though, in my estimates|pg||
nt|antoniz: jak wysoko dojad¹?|pg||
nt|barnets: In his earlier days young Madala would have opened 4@S as would many- now he opened 1@S and got a plus|pg||
nt|athene: interesting choice of overcall - 1nt was definitely an option there|pg||
nt|gulyas: or dbl|pg||

mb|1N|nt|hedyg: i dont like the 2@H bid :(|pg||
nt|hedyg: what is wrong with 2NT?|pg||
nt|brolucius: If Hedy and I would both rebid 2NT it must be right.|pg||
nt|bagman: It all depends on their methods. Playing standardish 2@H is wrong but here we do not know.|pg||
nt|hedyg: :) ty David|pg||
nt|sharkey: I think we all wud join in|pg||
nt|Gerben42: I guess if the Blue Team school told him not to, perhaps we all should listen ?|pg||
nt|bagman: Yes, if no aces :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Italya are more likely to win this than England are to beat Slovenia in the World Cup and England are '2-to-1 on'.|pg||

mb|p|nt|brolucius: Like a moment for a horror film. Strangely, the bookies have maintained exactly the same odds for England still to win the World Cup. 8/1 fourth favourites.|pg||

mb|p|nt|bagman: and often have no fit|pg||

pc|d2|nt|brolucius: Nor have they improved Argentina's odds, despite them looking so strong. Roland will explain the betting on the Denmark team.|pg||
nt|mbruun: First quarter 46-0 for Italy, second quarter 8-0 for Lithuania, now its time for the third|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That's a good stop ... it's a tempting hand, but the lack of aces is crucial|pg||
nt|hedyg: and the lead is....directed!|pg||
nt|brolucius: In the old days 1@D - 3@S would show the North hand. Now it is usually used as a splinter bid agreeing diamonds.|pg||
nt|hedyg: disc @c on @d and claim when that works for 11 tricks|pg||
nt|bagman: NS' system card states: NAT: maybe reverse bids|pg||
nt|brolucius: I am told that in Poland a 2NT rebid denies four hearts.|pg||

nt|brolucius: I don't really see the value in such a method because North can introduce hearts over a 2NT rebid. Meanwhile, South has given an excellent description of his hand.|pg||

nt|athene: not a great 6@H as you have a diamond to get rid of as well as the trump suit to negotiate, but not that bad|pg||
nt|athene: double dummy it makes of course - as does 7@S|pg||
nt|cicus: how would you play it on  a@D lead?|pg||
nt|hedyg: as does 6NT then|pg||

nt|marlowepi: well it wasnt a terribly confident auction, but still...opps are NV which means smaller penalty and also less likelihood EW have done something very overambitious|pg||
nt|brolucius: As I have mentioned before. Marc Smith tells me that in his system there is no way to avoid 3NT with 11 opposite 11. The responding hand raises the 2NT rebid to 3NT, in case opener ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: has 14. But he claims that such 22-point 3NT contracts are usually made. Not when I try it! |pg||
nt|hedyg: V/L play 1@s as 10-21 and Versace did NOT open!|pg||
nt|cicus: spades must come in anyway if you lose a trump so best seems a small trump to the 10|pg||
nt|athene: on a diamond lead you don't want to risk them knocking out the dummy entry which you might need for the spades|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes... we were trying to remember when last time Italy lost back to back matches|pg||
nt|petergill: 6@C, 6@S and 6NT are all playable, but how can North know that South has @C9, or South know that North has @C10? Too tough.|pg||

nt|xenya: deaja vu of sorts -- if NS bid 6@H or 6N, they will make it|pg||
nt|jbgood: Brogeland is in 6 hearts in the OR|pg||
nt|andy_h: This will allow 2M openings to be 8-11 which can be destructive and constructive in nature.  If you have ever come across those 6M with 10hcp that doesn't deem worthy of a 1M or a ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: 2M opening, then having the 2M=8-11 really helps|pg||
nt|rodvenn: qj of spades maybe a worry for Bocchi|pg||

nt|sybarra: quite a lead directing over call!|pg||
nt|petergill: It looks simple to do this, but it is not|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@D Precision, 11-15|pg||
nt|athene: well, you might just bash out @HAK and then hope to ruff spades down with the diamond as entry|pg||
nt|athene: it perhaps depends whether you get a club or diamond lead|pg||
nt|hedyg: in the mean time Hungary is in 12th position|pg||
nt|gulyas: thats what I thought|pg||
nt|cicus: but the entry is important only if spades are 3-3 with Q offside|pg||
nt|andyv:  this one still has a lot of boards|pg||
nt|fabsayc: but in this type of event you treat it as one long match, since the objective is qualification|pg||

nt|koksoy: 6@H  -1   is  my  guess...  |pg||
nt|bagman: N has good enough hand to bid 4NT or more for take out and then correct @C to diamonds|pg||
nt|paulg:  according to the CC, double is takeout emphasising the majors|pg||

nt|andyv:  it can be expensive that one VP|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 3@S could be called enterprising, even NV vs V|pg||
nt|bagman: West has no defense and no distributional surprises|pg||
nt|andyv:  well within the Versace playbook:)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: lol|pg||
nt|sybarra: maybe it meant colors |pg||
nt|marlowepi: perhaps W pulled wrong card, meaning to bid 1H|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I'd love to play with Marc Smith in that case lol|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 6@H seems reasonable|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 3NT solid @D with too much on the side?|pg||
nt|petergill: 3NT = solid @D's and close to 15 points|pg||
nt|athene: yes, that's quite a small factor|pg||
nt|koksoy: as  both  red  suits divided 4-0  I think  he  can  not  make  slem|pg||
nt|bagman: With both reds breaking as they are, 5@H is the limit|pg||
nt|koksoy: 3 @H   --  5nt  ??|pg||
nt|bagman: They surely bid slam, though|pg||
nt|paulg:  may gain 3 imps even if you go down in 6@h|pg||
nt|paulg:  there will be a few 7@h on the scoresheet|pg||
nt|koksoy: may  be..|pg||
nt|bagman: Declare might make 6@H X against careless defense|pg||
nt|paulg:  Denning may splinter in clubs here|pg||
nt|bagman: N wins the black lead and plays @HJ not covered|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 6H is good defence against 6C|pg||
nt|koksoy: 5 nt  is an old  conventition called  Josephine which asks partner about trump  quality  for  garandslem|pg||
nt|bagman: True, but EW have to find that suit first|pg||
nt|petergill: NS's 1NT is 14-16, so the 1NT rebid was 11-13 (or a very good 10)|pg||
nt|ziff:  Probably|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Again 2NT to show a weak hand. Partner is expected to rebid 3@C on most shapes. A direct 3@C would have been stronger.|pg||
nt|andyv:  that's why 4 person teams rarely win... just too much bridge over a short period of time.|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: Against good opponents 3@S might help them more than hurt them|pg||
nt|rodvenn: 6@h is easier. then declarer can investigate the distribution|pg||
nt|xenya: same in 6N|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: jak prosisz Irlandczyków Antoni to po angielsku|pg||
nt|sybarra: or is it transfer to hts?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I can see a TD call coming here|pg||
nt|Gerben42: define "too much" pd hasnt promised much|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Too much for a gambling 3NT|pg||
nt|Gerben42: gives Romanovski a tough decision|pg||
nt|petergill: Janis Romanovski realised that his void in partner's suit was terrible for higher contracts - well done|pg||
nt|athene: it's a good advertisement for a) not leading a singleton trump and b) not leading a trump against a small slam|pg||
nt|gulyas: they do have all the controls in the pack|pg||
nt|athene: but i doubt north is going to lead a heart :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: all like 3@H?|pg||
nt|hedyg: i prefer 3NT|pg||
nt|gulyas: its a nice suit|pg||
nt|cicus: I do|pg||
nt|hedyg: is it?|pg||
nt|gulyas: but I can see 3NT as well|pg||
nt|hedyg: the problem is that pd does not have AK@C!|pg||
nt|athene: whether 3@H is a nice suit will depend on how declarer plays it :)|pg||
nt|gulyas: all the controls show towards a suit contract|pg||
nt|hedyg: so you show that|pg||
nt|hedyg: he is imposing @hs and the suit just isnt good enough for that|pg||
nt|cicus: E has a problem here, he would like to invite to 6@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: Well, maybe West is prepared to play 4@h facing @hs?|pg||
nt|andyv:  and here it did help them in the OR to get to a thin game|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Landy over opponent's 1NT overcall :)|pg||
nt|mbruun: Trump lead is best for the defense. |pg||
nt|barnets: 6@H would have been better to spectate|pg||
nt|petergill: Entries are a bit awkward|pg||
nt|petergill: in 3NT|pg||
nt|Gerben42: too few high cards missing to really be in trouble though|pg||
nt|barnets: no he has 3@S 4@H a club and a few diamonds|pg||
nt|gulyas: with 12hcp, E may bid more than just 4@H|pg||

nt|hedyg: 4@s rkc in @H?|pg||
nt|cicus: the dreaded 4@S ace ask|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 4@S must be KC asking|pg||
nt|gulyas: yes|pg||
nt|bagman: As Philippe pointed out, EW can make 6@C|pg||
pc|h5|nt|daman: this looks like -1 to me|pg||
nt|daman: 3@Ds   2@Ss and a @H|pg||
nt|athene: slightly unusual that lauria-versace passed 2@D out|pg||
nt|athene: many pairs would be in a forcing situation after doubling a 1nt overcall|pg||
nt|daman: what do you think of a double of 2@D by South?|pg||
nt|athene: it's not the same as doubling a 1nt opener (even assuming you play that as strong) because here you know your side has the balance of the points|pg||
nt|athene: i assume NS play double as takeout and north didn't fancy it with such a threadbare hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 7/12 atm Paul|pg||
nt|hedyg: my version looked politer :)|pg||
nt|petergill: The play will be interesting, I think|pg||
pc|hA|nt|Walddk4: Top spot when you have a heart loser|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Losing one trick in each suit|pg||
nt|brolucius: This would normally rate as an OK game, but East's 1NT overcall means that there will be a trump loser.|pg||
nt|iceblue: 2NT is LEB, xfers to 3@C|pg||
nt|brolucius: The re-opening double gives North at least three options (clubs, NT or penalty pass).|pg||
nt|brgpro: on @s lead, N has to go up the 10 to make this|pg||
nt|jtr: I hate giving my partner options:)|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is what lazy bidding-panel members describe as a 'flexible action'. (All readers groan immediately).|pg||
nt|bagman: After 3@S it's not possible for NS to stay in 3@C and they might have to bid game as N has enough to act|pg||
nt|bagman: If North is going to lead a heart against 3NT, he should lead a low|pg||
nt|brolucius: If they use ten bids this time too, they will surely get too high.|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Okay, maybe not 2-way... lol|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He suggested that he and I have a game soon. Maybe I should accept|pg||
nt|bagman: and they have actually the highest making contract|pg||
nt|koksoy: Nederlands-Slovakya  2-0|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: The last week has been really pleasurable here, but for two days (one of which is today) where it was overcast|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|pasker: Lauria is probably giving a choice between 3NT and 4@S|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 1@D did show @H apparently|pg||
nt|brolucius: If any kibitzers are thinking of logging off, to enjoy the sunshine, I am told that they will miss one of the most spectacular distributional hands of all time, later in this set.|pg||
nt|paulg:  3@d was no doubt intended as a good raise, but the diamond raise makes it sound less like one|pg||
nt|ziff:  Hand doesn t lie very well for declarer. Control may become a problem|pg||
pc|d4|nt|Walddk4: Top spot for N-S that is, 4@C for E-W|pg||
nt|othered1: Or maybe not. Concention card says what Hedy describes in 1N box, but 1@C box says it shows outside of NT range (11-13).  So which is it?|pg||
nt|bagman: A low heart can give declarer a problem|pg||
nt|gulyas: 0-3|pg||
nt|gulyas: @HQ?|pg||
nt|hedyg: now asking about Q@H|pg||

pc|dT|nt|jtr: @d lead also gives the vital entry|pg||
nt|brgpro: and he will play @cA and @c i think|pg||
nt|brolucius: In case East or West has @CK-x-x.|pg||
nt|brolucius: 3NT+2 at the other table, I am told.|pg||

nt|antoniz: piêkne odejcie|pg||

nt|brolucius: It will be nice to say: 'Well, yes, we did lose to Germany in the World Cup, but - against that - I enjoyed that big hand on BBO this morning.'|pg||
nt|Walddk2: England supporters are kindly requested not to have a look at the scoreline in the match against the Netherlands|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Half full glasses are better than the half empty ones|pg||
nt|stc: The problem here is if @c are 4-4 or not|pg||
nt|brolucius: Full glasses even better.|pg||
nt|cicus: 4@S gains in 1 out of 1000 and causes trouble on every 2nd hand|pg||
nt|gulyas: what do you mean?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: This makes sense because else 4@S by responder would be a @S cue and the strong hand would ask Aces, which doesn't make sense|pg||
nt|paulg:  I hate auctions where there is some doubt over the trump suit .. surely Denning would cue bid 5@c if he was certain about hearts?|pg||
nt|koksoy: what  is  1@C  double ??  can  it  be  majors ??|pg||

pc|dK|nt|brolucius: I am told: 2@h=4@h or max w/o 4M  2@s = relay 3@c = 4@h/4m min. 3@d = asks minor 3@h = 4@c|pg||
nt|cicus: I hate 4@S ace ask for @Hs|pg||

nt|gulyas: I love it|pg||
nt|hedyg: why Gabor?|pg||
nt|hedyg: i love it too|pg||
nt|cicus: see above|pg||
nt|athene: i agree these tweaks to improve blackwood cause much more trouble than they save - it's like the difference betwenen 3014 and 1430|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Why Gabor?|pg||
nt|gulyas: he passes them too often:)|pg||
nt|petergill: The 3 declarers in Group B who have played 4@S so far have made it, with the clubs coming in. |pg||

nt|athene: in theory, one is about a fifth of a percent better|pg||
nt|cicus: I have seen several misunderstandings using it|pg||
nt|athene: in practice, what happens is, people have misunderstandings over which they are playing about every second hand|pg||

nt|iain sime: Another big swing for Italy here as 25 points not enough for a Swiss 3NT in the other room.|pg||
nt|hedyg: it is the 2@H bid that is strange with 11 hcps|pg||
nt|barnets: @SQ @DAKQ @HK|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|bagman: North knew to lead low with known 4-carder on his right. Now he hit gold|pg||
nt|brolucius: You can see what I meant when I mentioned 'hard work' a short while ago. It would all be too much for me.|pg||
nt|hedyg: you just stick to your agreements|pg||
nt|gulyas: a disciplined pass|pg||
nt|cicus: there is never a problem with 4NT ace asking|pg||
nt|hedyg: wow Hungary moving ahead|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: That's like saying you don't want to play any gadget because it could go wrong|pg||
nt|gulyas: strange to see E stop after seeing all aces are there, only the @HQ missing|pg||

nt|petergill: as the cards lie - best was @S10, spade to queen, @SAKQ to pitch clubs, then hearts after all the unblocking...|pg||

nt|hedyg: so am i|pg||
nt|petergill: If North !! ducks @CQ, does the defence have a chance?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|atabey: they play 15-17 NT. only white against red 14-16. so their 1NT rebid there is 11-13|pg||
nt|hedyg: hey i said : unlikely. i am just looking for a case to play Q@s|pg||
nt|athene: it all comes to the same thing|pg||

pc|s4|nt|jtr: Of course the entry isnt vital if you play Ax@c|pg||

nt|andyv:  S certainly has a problem here with the non-forcing 3@c bid|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|bagman: Sementa needs to cover the @HJ|pg||

pc|c5|nt|pasker: not any more it seems|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|hedyg: N had a clear 2@d bid and 2NT over 2@s by S|pg||
nt|iain sime: The Italian East opened 1@D in third and that seemed to cause the Swiss to play in 2@H|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Third hand NV vs V it's different, I suppose|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer taking safety play in trumps|pg||
nt|koksoy: he  will  get  schocked  when  he  will  see  4-0 diamond  break  :)|pg||
nt|bagman: He's close to claiming now|pg||
nt|petergill: Good defence so far|pg||

pc|h4|nt|brolucius: 2@H is about 8-10 and he could downgrade such as @CQ-J doubleton. I don't think it is a bad response. |pg||
nt|hedyg: you know pd will not bid game with 14 opposite 2@H|pg||
nt|stc: he didn't make yet|pg||
nt|stc: he will go down if he play @H@h|pg||
nt|petergill: Ozols preferred to retain the spade entry to his @D's - both lines of play are safe|pg||

nt|petergill: Yes Bas, very fast. I think Latvia was fined 1VP in Round 1, but not this time|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: Although we saw a pretty good translation of the Lithuanian system notes earlier this week :)|pg||
nt|cicus: hey, what's that alert, Bas|pg||
nt|athene: i think any modern player should be able to say "sorry, partner" in any language|pg||
nt|skorchev: double @H finesse is his best chance - 25% .... he could slightly improve drawing @SAK wating for @SQJ doubleton, but then he would be short of entries to finesse @HS twice|pg||
nt|paulg:  2@c shows the majors|pg||
mb|4D|nt|Walddk2: Many distinguish between garbage (2@D) and constructive (2M)|pg||

mb|d|nt|hedyg: take away his bidding box?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Yes, when the opps generally play slower than you it can be a pretty powerful weapon|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: It takes a lot of experience (which EW obviously have) to keep your own pace|pg||
nt|rodvenn: Madala seem not to be up to the standard of Brogeland yet. But he is young|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: lol, that means a lot, given the amount of sessions I've seen you commentate, haha|pg||
nt|capercliff: that wasnt really a slow pass was it?|pg||
mb|4S|nt|Walddk2: Gazzilli I presume|pg||
nt|mbruun: Sp K is huge, but still 1 NT is stretchy|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: No, it wasn't|pg||
nt|capercliff: tx|pg||
nt|paulg:  of course the Scottish expectations for this match will be low so Piper does have free rein to try for a result|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I just figured that with all my typing I might as well enter the bidding real life when I'm typing :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: why did he pass?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Wasn't he the 15 year old wonder boy 10 years ago?|pg||
nt|bogier: ktr mog³aby doprowadziæ do sytuacji ¿e N podejmowa³by decyzjê na poziomie 4|pg||
nt|marlowepi: yes, for promotion, but he can do that no matter which trump trick he wins|pg||
nt|mamos: ah yes  he just didnt do it |pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: There is some kind of socialist festival going on outside with loud music, fire crackers and a small carnival|pg||
nt|brolucius: Some players use a new major at the two-level (facing a weak two-bid of some sort) to be invitational but non-forcing. In that way they can pick up the games where there is a fit ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: for responder's suit. A new suit at the three-level is forcing.|pg||
nt|petergill: Interesting (disciplined?) that Sementa chooses 3@D raise rather than direct 4@S|pg||
nt|petergill: I expected North to bid 5@C|pg||
nt|paulg:  Shields bids 2@s so that he can compete in hearts on the next round ... if there were one|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|dougdscsu: really dont like pass with Piper's hand, hes got 9 hcp and support for partners suit..|pg||
nt|paulg:  i'm sure it was an 'action' pass|pg||
nt|andy_h: Looks like a swing for norway here|pg||
nt|brolucius: Neither East rates his hand as worth a 2@D bid to show a sound raise to 2@H. No, but it is around a maximum for the direct raise.|pg||
nt|hedyg: 1@H is 7+|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I am being told Finnish and Hungarian have a shared ancestry, there you go kids, don't believe what you're being told :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  Italy chipping away at the lead with 2 imp gains on boards 7 and 8|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: 2@C either natural or any 16+|pg||
nt|bogier: troche zamieszania- Cezary walczy z w³asn¹ intuicj¹, która podpowiada³a mu skrecic w BA|pg||
nt|bagman: If @SK were wrong and the clubs very badly, declarer got from the lead a heart trick for his 10th trick|pg||
nt|mamos: perfect playing conditions for bridge|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I am sorry, sometimes bid don't register properly...|pg||
nt|cicus: that theory is already refuted|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: That's only proving my last point :)|pg||
nt|athene: if this auction was forced on EW by system it's not a great advertisement for polish club 1@C opener in competition, i don't think|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: 2@H natural but denies 8+hcp|pg||
nt|capercliff: he might double if they reach 5@d?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: he is only 23 I hear, born 1987|pg||
nt|bagman: There were entry problems to go for that line and set up 3 heart tricks|pg||
nt|hedyg: as usual the @c suit got lost|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer is playing close to DD|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Sorry all, the OR crashed so we had to reestablish the link|pg||
pc|d6|nt|andy_h: The 2@S opening did its job, with the 3@S adding more preemptive value|pg||
nt|lesniak: oczywiscie wist w trefla kladaie 3 ba ale kto to wymysli|pg||
nt|antoniz: please heart lead|pg||
nt|brolucius: And the @D suit.|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Don't NS play weak 2's?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Or did Madala judge it as too bad|pg||
nt|barnets: same contract|pg||
nt|petergill: North does not like to use the Pass Card unless he has to|pg||
nt|paulg:  as it happens, the double fit means that they have missed game|pg||
nt|koksoy: and  2@D  seems  natural...  because he  prefered to  bid 2@S  with  4-4  major|pg||
nt|bagman: Sementa's going to play a trump now|pg||
pc|dK|nt|Walddk2: 3@C natural, NF|pg||
nt|bagman: here there are 3 top tricks to lose and then declarer has to guess the trumps (which he will after this lead)|pg||
nt|antoniz: dobrze Rysiu:)|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: pañskie zyczenie jest rozkazem|pg||
nt|vasmar: E-W can make 3@D|pg||

nt|petergill: Bas - when in doubt, assume that Ozols did not pass?|pg||
nt|athene: if east really has to jump all the way to 3nt just to show the strong hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  great dummy for N|pg||
pc|d3|nt|hedyg: 2@H is wow|pg||
nt|paulg:  might double 3N|pg||
nt|hedyg: specs suggest he cannot play the hand if he raises |pg||
nt|capercliff: or 3N for a @s lead?|pg||
nt|mamos: 3NT was good i was just going to say   but  .....|pg||
nt|brolucius: Six cards, 4-10 points, on their card.|pg||

pc|d2|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So 16-18 with spades and clubs|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Is there a brake pedal to this auction?|pg||
nt|sybarra: nice of @S's to be 3/3|pg||
nt|mbruun: North will probably lead a diamond against a spade contract, and the 3-3 break combined with good intermediates allows it to make|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Sementa could have passed 3@C|pg||
nt|mdgraham: he could have passed 1@S too|pg||
nt|mbruun: With a nondiamond lead declarer lacks an entry|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Indeed|pg||
nt|capercliff: 4@h is a good contract|pg||
nt|dougdscsu: still hope for italy, 2-1 now|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Thanks|pg||
nt|capercliff: and maybe 6@d on any lead other than a @h|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Won't tell him until the contract is over, dw Scots :)|pg||
nt|xenya: and a huge one|pg||
nt|bagman: Then, on the other hand, declarer might have lost a spade and two clubs with the heart|pg||
nt|stc: -5 possible|pg||
nt|hedyg: now J@C|pg||
nt|hedyg: well, only 50/ trick|pg||
pc|s2|nt|brolucius: Declarer must take steps to avoid two trump losers. Ace and low to the jack will work.|pg||
nt|brolucius: He can afford that safety play only when he knows that there are only two losers in the side suits.|pg||
nt|brolucius: With three side-suit losers he would have to play the A-K, hoping to drop a doubleton queen.|pg||
nt|atabey: very good pass by assael. could be a cold 4@h|pg||
nt|hedyg: did we miss out a double Bas?|pg||
nt|bagman: They are on their way. West seems to think that diamonds are solid (and they are :) )|pg||
nt|marlowepi: after the king of hearts drops the queen from N, there is a good case for swtiching tacks and knocking out the ace of clubs. you want to take the entry out of the hand that has the ...|pg||

nt|petergill: downgrading the 4333 makes bidding the slam very tough = unlucky |pg||
nt|athene: although he might even survive that perhaps|pg||
mb|4H|nt|hedyg: looks like a preempt hand to me|pg||
nt|bagman: up goes the ace and down goes the contract|pg||
nt|bagman: Either S or W might be thinking right now; S should not, though|pg||

nt|babs59: is the DBL a negative bid perhaps?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Seeing as it was alerted I'm not sure whether it's actually a penalty X|pg||
nt|babs59: often it's the negative after overcalls|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 6@C is a maker here because @SK is onside and @ST9 stiff, I think|pg||
mb|p|nt|brolucius: Yes, but not polite to boast about it. Think about the French and English supporters...|pg||
nt|bagman: N is not going to sit, I guess|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 6NT with a not unlikely @H lead is on, haha|pg||

nt|skorchev: asking for imps? :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  W has easy @s lead|pg||
nt|andyv:  and can probably switch to @d without much ado|pg||

nt|paulg:  North's 4@s is reasonable, but not what South wanted to hear|pg||

nt|koksoy: pass  is  ok..|pg||
nt|bagman: Any move and NS go minus|pg||
nt|paulg:  at this vulnerability the ace of hearts may be opposite void|pg||

nt|brolucius: Thanks for watching!|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznk: I liked the one against us as well, Roland ;)|pg||
nt|brolucius: West's 3@C will be some sort of heart raise - perhaps a mini-splinter. |pg||

nt|dougdscsu: what an exciting week in both bridge and sports worlds|pg||
nt|bagman: W is going to try a surprise spade lead|pg||
nt|bagman: Here the size matters, is he going to lead the A?|pg||
nt|brolucius: South surely has nothing to think about, it must be West thinking.|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Never mind me, I counted 9 @Cs|pg||
nt|athene: ok - it's a bit more serious than that - it takes club lead and immediate diamond shift to beat, i think|pg||

nt|bagman: Good decision; sometimes partner has the wonder cards but most often not|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 7-card major+raise=game|pg||
nt|ziff:  In the race for the qualifying positions the first 7 teams in this group should be fairly safe by now, with Wales, Norway, Hungary, Latvia and Croatia fighting it out for the last two spots.|pg||
pc|d5|nt|bagman: NS found a good sac here :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  a little rich with the vul but the distribution hard to argue against|pg||

nt|brolucius: Better to not qualify than to reach South Africa and play like idiots.|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: I'd feel more comfortable bidding 1@S and raising @H after that, wouldn't that describe my hand better?|pg||
nt|brgpro: well, versace did the same but Lauria just gave it a try then signed off when pd said so|pg||
nt|brolucius: I will not be adding this bidding method to my card.|pg||

nt|Walddk2: Icemen are fearless. As soon as there is a game in sight .....|pg||
nt|brgpro: anyone is interested to talk about table tennis?:)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: to be fair, on a different lead it would have been a 5 or 7 hand|pg||

nt|mdgraham: Wales, eh? :)|pg||

nt|bagman: Reminds of the meckwell deal against pakistan some (30) years ago|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, we all remember that...|pg||
nt|brolucius: Again it must be West thinking at this point. The bids are made in pairs, each side of the screen.|pg||
nt|bogier: system kanape?|pg||
nt|athene: i imagine the way to make this is get the clubs going fast for diamond discards|pg||
nt|athene: but i think declarer might have to be looking at all four hands to find the winning line|pg||
nt|koksoy: look  at  the  methods ..  how  you  can  find a  game  after 15-17  nt  opening  as  Ýtalians  did|pg||

nt|bagman: And he has 4 diamonds and @CA + @HA|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: And @SJ|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Asking for shape  3@D  3343 or 3334  3@H asking  3NT  3334   If Bocchi had four diamonds, Madala might have been interested in slam|pg||
nt|andyv:  for Roland's benefit... the auction would have been over at 2@s if EW played Flannery:)|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|Walddk4: Still plenty of vugraph today. The Swiss Cup Jean Besse from Geneva just started. 48 boards to be played there|pg||
nt|brgpro: in talking|pg||

nt|brolucius: Not a very good game to hope to slip through when facing Italy.|pg||
nt|jtr: There!|pg||
nt|mdgraham: If 3NT was a "serious" slam try, 4@S looks an underbid, but perhaps there is more to this than that |pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: EW discussing in Italian, sounds like an opera lol|pg||
nt|bagman: West had a very marginal T/O X by passed hand. With the @DQ changed to @HQ, he would have doubled, I think|pg||

nt|bagman: 2 trump tricks to come|pg||
pc|cK|nt|barnets: why should he downgrade such a nice hand|pg||
nt|babs59: the trump break stops declarer - she can no longer lead @HA and @H, then cross to the third @C in dummy|pg||
nt|babs59: because South can give her partner a ruff - so it hinges on the @S again|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: Versace looked at me with a look of despair on his face and I shook my head, Italy out|pg||
nt|capercliff: and rightly taking his time|pg||
nt|capercliff: he might consider playing the K@d then 4 rounds of @c's, but that doesnt really help him here|pg||

mb|2N|an|*|nt|Walddk2: Yes|pg||
nt|bagman: This is likely to go down|pg||
nt|andyv:  2@c overcall by W might not be a favorite by all|pg||
nt|bagman: Requires something like @DA and diamond and then heart finesse to make|pg||
nt|mdgraham: NS will have this hand to discuss at length later as well|pg||
nt|hedyg: it is exactly 5-4 with 15 hcps|pg||
nt|bagman: With xxx in diamonds, N expects fit to some suit as S probably has at most xx in diamonds|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@D are makeble, 3@h no|pg||
nt|bagman: With a higher spot than @H7, South might get an idea (I know N is passed)|pg||
nt|pasker: S may even be able to promote the @H7 on a @C lead|pg||
nt|bagman: if he had 3 trump tricks and the defensive values in the minors, X might net sometimes 300, which is 5IMPs better than 100|pg||
nt|andyv:  if this were a B-A-M, Italy would be ahead 5-3 after 10 boards|pg||
nt|snetram:  grozi kontra na 4 pik|pg||
nt|jkotor: S chyba naci¹ga na t¹ kontrê|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: This removes the entry to @DK|pg||
nt|bagman: Unless declarer wins it with the @SA|pg||
nt|bagman: This opens up a legitimate chance to make this; declarer goes up, picks the trumps with AK and leads a diamond up|pg||
nt|andyv:  Bocchi has certainly made Madala work today:)|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer knows that W has at most KJ on the top of her clubs and, thus, most of the other high cards|pg||
nt|andyv:  still should lose a @s, @d and 2@c|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: spade and diamond both right  - AND he avoided the club lead ..but 3-1 trumps will still prove insurmountable, surely|pg||
nt|bjacobs: It is: "pass is for penalties if the passer is sitting OVER the suit bid - it is neutral if sitting UNDER the suit bid"|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@d asking for distribution|pg||
mb|4H!|nt|hedyg: 2@s transfer to 2NT|pg||
nt|atabey: 2@s standard relay I thk. with a very weak hand they bid 2@h|pg||
nt|othered1: other room found 4@S, to their regret as cards lie.|pg||
nt|capercliff: i wonder what 3@s means?|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@S= short in @H|pg||
nt|sharkey: S decided to stay one level lower - not making pref to @C|pg||
nt|bagman: 3@C would have been an easier make I guess (needing 4 club tricks)|pg||
nt|athene: horrible lead problem for south here|pg||
nt|snetram:  Adam nie daÅ siÄ nabraÄ|pg||
nt|petergill: Top 7 qualify for BB if Netherlands (home team for BB) finish in top six, else 6 teams qualify|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: no stayman with 4 3 3 3|pg||
nt|daman: transportation is an issue on this hand|pg||
nt|sharkey: 2 @S may turn out ok as well|pg||
nt|bagman: The spades are nicely but the clubs need to be worked on|pg||
nt|bagman: More chances to go wrong in 2 spades. In 3@C the line of play is sortof forced|pg||
nt|bagman: and if you double only contracts which go down, you double too seldom|pg||
nt|andyv:  it's interesting how aggressive NS have been in the bidding but not in the doubling.|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: ah 2NT opened|pg||
nt|brgpro: everyday i learn something new.....what is 3@h?|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: Oops|pg||
nt|brgpro: and what is 1NT?|pg||
nt|capercliff: 4@c KC?|pg||
nt|capercliff: 4@s 2 without?|pg||
nt|hedyg: looks like it|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The slam is below par anyway|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And now it is completely dead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The double is Lightner, asking for an unusual lead, normally dummy's suit|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the rule to "pass" is frequently a good rule :)|pg||
nt|athene: you know partner has nothing so whatever you lead is probably going to cost|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphznk: It was a 2NT opener :(|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2NT was opened (20-22 on their card).|pg||
nt|Walddk2: The good thing for Lithuania is that 1@DXX is not game, so no bonus|pg||
nt|jbgood: well done|pg||
nt|andy_h: It's always nice when you get to ruff with your singleton trump|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Double = "Partner, I have a void, your job to figure out where"|pg||
nt|xenya: might go 2 off -- not that it matters much|pg||
nt|bagman: defense is often the hard part of the game and to make marginal doubles one has to rely on good defense|pg||
nt|gulyas: this a push again:) (there, I said it)|pg||
nt|petergill: 1@H was alerted only because it was forcing|pg||
pc|h4|nt|athene: not trivial for declarer here at all|pg||
nt|antoniz: poziom operatorów jest pora¿aj¹cy|pg||
nt|bagman: Sementa wondering if this is the situation to go up to protect partner'e entry|pg||
pc|h5|nt|jtr: half of what he bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: other room didnt have the 2@d at their disposal|pg||
nt|sharkey: agree Pekka - 3@C more of a "coffee" hand|pg||
nt|bagman: now N has quite clearcut AK clubs |pg||
nt|jkotor: Na szczêcie Ada nie powiela takich kontraktów, ups...|pg||
nt|snetram:  ale Cezary a i owszem|pg||
pc|h2|nt|brgpro: aha, that explains it:)|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: Bocchi only takes out one bidding card :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bas probably flirting with the Lavazza girls and got distracted|pg||
nt|hedyg: best lead|pg||
nt|brolucius: South found out that 3@H was not a risk-free bid.|pg||
nt|bogier: :(|pg||
nt|jkotor: ³adna akcja S-a|pg||

nt|babs59: what's the time for you?|pg||
nt|babs59: 3am?|pg||
nt|andyv:  3:15am|pg||
nt|babs59: West is just deciding whether the spades can cash|pg||
nt|babs59: either that or she's stressing South?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: That's dedication Andy|pg||
nt|andyv:  with that suit in dummy?|pg||

nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
nt|babs59: ah, no stress :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  the insomniac coup|pg||
nt|babs59: I was playing a Zonal v. New Zealand and my opponent took 25 minutes at trick 1|pg||
nt|babs59: then played the worst card|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|bagman: Now West needs to go up and attack clubs|pg||
nt|hedyg: nice contract|pg||
nt|paulg:  with the British Andy Murray winning (he only becomes Scottish when he loses), Italy going out of the World Cup, perhaps a Scotland win here would be the lead in tomorrow's papers|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: Roland Wald|pg||

nt|petergill: Well stopped, with the five level being very dangerous |pg||
pc|dA|nt|vugraphznk: Roland has eyes everywhere...|pg||
nt|athene: hard for west to duck the club perhaps but it would have made things harder for declarer |pg||
nt|daman: a@H play now might be fatal|pg||
nt|athene: declarer now has some transportation to untangle his black tricks|pg||
nt|athene: four clubs, two spades, and the red aces is still only eight though|pg||
nt|athene: double dummy he can make quite easily by dropping the @HJ of course|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@s showed 2 keycards and cuebid in @s|pg||
nt|paulg:  nice contract but potential gain of 2 imps if Scotland bid the inferior 6@s|pg||
nt|hedyg: a lauria speciality|pg||
nt|bagman: Now @CA and trouble|pg||
nt|bogier: a u nas juz trenuje ekipa operatorów na przysz³oroczne ME w Poznaniu :)|pg||

nt|bogier: znowu przed [parti¹|pg||
nt|stc: Madala is learning fast, this time he passed :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Madala has had enough of making risky heart bids.|pg||
nt|hedyg: pay-back time |pg||
nt|bogier: spryciarz|pg||
nt|paulg:  Madala and Bocchi bidding every possible game at the moment and finding a perfect lie of the cards|pg||
nt|bagman: Now the rest is about overtricks|pg||
nt|babs59: so at trick 2 she took another 10 minutes!|pg||
pc|d2|nt|brolucius: Yes, he has always been interested in coffee.|pg||
nt|jtr: But usually focussed on Lavazza girls|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|bagman: I think that Madala made up his mind about the hearts|pg||
nt|rodvenn: it surely must  be reight to save a tick. Well done charlsen|pg||
nt|rodvenn: trick|pg||
nt|gulyas: maybe he should play on @Ds|pg||
nt|cicus: hmm, this was not urgent|pg||
nt|gulyas: do they lead 4th best?|pg||
nt|hedyg: he was in dummy, what should he play?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: NS lead odd|pg||
pc|c5|nt|athene: heart to the @HQ and @HK|pg||
nt|athene: and now it looks percentage to finesse the ten|pg||
nt|daman: yes|pg||
nt|athene: unblock @SK first|pg||
nt|athene: still lauria has a bit of a habit of making these contracts, so let's see....|pg||
nt|athene: Lauria might suspect that west has the @HK|pg||
nt|athene: otherwise why no heart back after the @CK>|pg||
nt|athene: ?|pg||
nt|athene: but even if he knew that, i don't see how it would really help that much|pg||
nt|athene: perhaps he will cash the @SK then run the clubs and judge whether to exit @SA, spade|pg||
nt|Walddk2: apart from the overtrick of course|pg||
nt|babs59: THAT was tough to remain focused|pg||
pc|cT|nt|Walddk2: Bas will insert result on 16 when he gets a minute. Please be patient|pg||
pc|cA|nt|jtr: Now maybe an overtrick?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that's a relief, then|pg||
nt|bjacobs: That's a "half is glass full" theory Roland by the look of it|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@d would have been 1 or 4, not showing cue in @d|pg||
nt|bagman: hoping that partner has 2 trump tricks|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|brgpro: he will get one for sure|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you don't want too many good results like this, though|pg||
nt|andyv:  one specs chimes in with they've been told not to double.|pg||
pc|c8|nt|athene: interesting he didn't unblock the spade - now a club return is very bad surely|pg||
pc|c3|nt|pasker: S can then play the 4th round of clubs to promote his 7 of trumps|pg||
pc|cK|nt|gulyas: he can play on @Ds|pg||
nt|cicus: well, yes, @H and @D was equal chance|pg||
nt|hedyg: they lead 3/5 and attitude|pg||
nt|gulyas: I know, I can see all hands|pg||
nt|andyv:  looks like that happened here too|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|koksoy: they  had  more  then   1.0  butler   ranking  a  few  matches  ago|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|sharkey: shud make|pg||
nt|bagman: Now 2x diamonds, @CT and club|pg||
nt|brolucius: Trump promotion.|pg||
nt|sharkey: kib says no..|pg||
nt|sharkey: yes|pg||
pc|h3|nt|kiwi_joker: well, just goes to show. Madala the Magician strikes again|pg||
nt|brolucius: You can risk 3@H on some hands with a suit like that, but a bit dodgy with 3-2-2 on the side.|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|athene: ok, no reason to get that right|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|bagman: ruff!|pg||
nt|cicus: I only these 4|pg||
nt|koksoy: as  Duboin  -  Bocchi   did  several  times|pg||
nt|babs59: clock watching was my best option :)|pg||

nt|hedyg: A@s and @s works now|pg||
nt|gulyas: going down now|pg||
nt|hedyg: no|pg||
nt|hedyg: oh yes sry , 9@c in N|pg||
nt|athene: he can still make if he reads the position|pg||
nt|gulyas: N has an entry to the high @H|pg||
nt|athene: although NS have done well to organise the clubs so south doesn't get endplayed|pg||
nt|cicus: but what does S discard?|pg||
nt|athene: yes but if you exit a heart now, what does south throw?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: If he plays @SA @S, he'll have 2@S and 2@D + 5 = 9?|pg||
nt|athene: south is squeezed in three suits|pg||
pc|d3|nt|daman: and Lauria is a careful declarer|pg||
nt|bagman: Rare misdefense by Sementa|pg||
nt|bagman: he probably did not believe that the declarer would take that line with that hand|pg||
nt|bogier: Bal chyba uzna³, ¿e pas partnera jest forsuj¹cy??|pg||

nt|mdgraham: as 1@c can be a balanced 19-23, I reckon South thought that that was what North had, and that he would bid with any other type|pg||

nt|andy_h: They say that one of the top conventions that creates the biggest swings comes from the Lightner Double. If you and your partner ever wish to take this (brilliant) convention on, ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: make sure you have clear agreements of when it applies and which suit does it imply|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Director has been called|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Apparently Bocchi held the @s9 before leading a @D|pg||
nt|Walddk2: what now?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Hofta called the TD|pg||
nt|andy_h: held or led?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Did his partner see @S9?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: According to Bocchi he held, according to Hofta he put it on the table, the tray was closed at the time|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: The tray was only opened after the @D lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So what is the problem?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Chaos describes it aptly atm|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Tray = screen|pg||
nt|andy_h: if the screen was closed then there should not be a problem at all. This is one of the main advantages of playing behind screens!|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: According to Hoffa, Bocchi almost put down the @S9, he wanted to put dummy down and then Bocchi changed the card|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So facts are disputed|pg||
nt|Walddk2: It happens|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I, personally, didn't see a card before the @D|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I'm not sure if Bocchi has disputed showing the @S9 as a lead to Hofta|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In those situations, the TD *can* ask a spectator if he so wishes, but it rarely happens|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: He did|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Bas is a spectator in this context|pg||
nt|rodvenn: this is being discussed now in the press rooms with very good expert TDs present|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Please kibs, I am impartial in this, I'm only reporting what I see and hear at the table, I have no hidden agenda|pg||

nt|bridge_one: the best result is 4@D dbl less 1 = -100|pg||
nt|pasker: I think W was likely to bid at all vulnerabilities|pg||
nt|bagman: Here my suggestion did not help N|pg||
nt|brolucius: There have been some instructive bidding boards. Perhaps the most valuable lesson is that you should not take a gamble that is destined to lose.|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@D= a major suit|pg||
mb|4H|mb|p|nt|brolucius: I wonder how many teams contain a sponsor. The round-robin format makes that a more difficult proposition than it would be in such as the Bermuda Bowl. That is one reason why the ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: USA have a poor record in the bridge Olympiad.|pg||
nt|andy_h: 1NT = (14)15-17|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Bocchi tried to Charlsen, who stated he didn't mind. Then Hoffa asked for the screen to be closed|pg||
nt|sharkey: Canape style OR may have complicated matters|pg||
nt|petergill: A spec wisely pointed out that 12-15 is too wide as a 1NT range = very good point - that was part of the problem|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: no raise to 3@H from North|pg||
nt|mdgraham: four trumps to the queen and an ace....|pg||
nt|bjacobs: shell shocked perhaps|pg||
nt|bjacobs: it can happen|pg||
nt|antoniz: p³askie -1|pg||
mb|p|nt|bjacobs: I like 3@H - sort of offering a choice of contracts.  East has already shown his heart stopper, presumably|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: Me too|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: *tried to apologise to|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: So much to type...|pg||
nt|andy_h: According to the K&R Evaluator, West's hand comes to 12.20.  http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi?hand=QJ9+Q7+KQ743+KJ10|pg||
nt|stc: The so-called MultiLandy, very more and more popular|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2NT is four card heart raise|pg||
nt|bagman: Philosophical question, with a hand that bad as S has, showing 12 cards instead of 5 with a single call might be a good policy|pg||
nt|petergill: North did well to bid 3@H opposite 14-16|pg||
nt|mdgraham: won't matter here, but you can play transfers after that sort of overcall, to get the stroing NT hand being declarer.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|hedyg: S has too much to pass :(|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: An other argument of the Italians was that Hoffa should've called the TD before the screen was opened if he felt wronged|pg||
nt|brolucius: South's 2@H was to play in partner's major. That is why North did not pass - South had not shown hearts.|pg||
nt|hedyg: @d lead and a @C back?|pg||
nt|iain sime: Woolsey I think is another name for it.|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I always thought the only difference between ML and Cappeletti is the reverse of 2m (2@C in Cap is the 2@D in ML), is that true?|pg||
nt|petergill: 3@S = some sort of good raise to 4@H|pg||

pc|sA|nt|brolucius: Only one win, I think.|pg||
nt|rodvenn: What the experts say here is that the fact that the screen is down does not automatically give Bocchi the right to change.  |pg||
nt|Walddk2: No|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I've seen players change cards and calls behind screens, I'm not sure if that's in accordance with the rules though|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes Iain, depending which side of the water you are on :)|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 2@C used with only 3 trumps|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|hedyg: lucky 3NT with no entry to the W hand|pg||
nt|andyv:  yes and another hand with little to comment on|pg||
nt|babs59: yes correct - but I guess you can correct the score for us?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: There is no reason to|pg||
pc|dA|nt|bjacobs: He isn't, but if partner is moving away from NT, Duboin will agree |pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: If E did intend 3@H to let W choose, W didn't take it that way|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Why not?|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Didn't he choose?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: He just said 3@H probably was half a stop|pg||
nt|bjacobs: oh|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Denying 4@S anyway|pg||
nt|andy_h: But that doesn't refrain them from the 1NT opening - they also have another edge, that is, it is pre-emptive. If you hover your mouse to the open room score on the top-left, you ...|pg||
nt|andy_h: can see the auction from the Open Room. Versace also opened it 1NT|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Usually, when a player decides to allow/disallow a screenmate to change a call/card, it's dependant on personal relations|pg||
nt|sharkey: not sure - but West's raise to game seems very conservative|pg||
nt|Gerben42: even have time to let the strong hand play it|pg||
nt|cicus: another struggle for 9 tricks is coming|pg||
nt|bagman: MIght treat that Kxxxx as a 4-carder|pg||
pc|d2|nt|hedyg: why not bid 2NT?|pg||
nt|daman: good bidding|pg||
nt|bjacobs: Oh well, it was a fine auction, even if a misunderstanding|pg||

nt|andyv:  it looks like NS agreed to -1|pg||

nt|vasmar: now diamond lost|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: There's actually a VG theatre here, but it's well isolated from the playing area :)|pg||

nt|lesniak: fajnie zaczyna bal- prowokuje do grania w atu|pg||
nt|petergill: as long as you are not the sort of people who forget your system |pg||
pc|s8|nt|Walddk2: But as I understand it, N and E don't agree as to whether @S9 had been played or not. Anyway, that's why we have TDs; it's for them to sort out|pg||
nt|bagman: bad minors and bad shape|pg||
nt|antoniz: karo proszê,a widzisz wiara czyni cuda:)|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Dbl by lauria at 2@s is a raise in @D in decent hand|pg||
nt|bagman: North did not support so surprise attac might work. And now it does|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer has 9 tricks, though|pg||
nt|paulg:  with the marked heart finesse|pg||
pc|s2|pc|s3|nt|hedyg: in OR W passed and left th bidding open for opps|pg||
nt|brolucius: In Turkey-Switzerland there was a noble push in 6@S bid and made.|pg||

pc|sQ|pg||
nt|andyv:  a fast claimer... could actually make 4 if he believes E's dbl showed @hs|pg||

nt|bagman: No heart lead now|pg||
nt|brolucius: Bold double by South.|pg||
nt|hedyg: S led A@H in OR and switched to the A@c!|pg||
nt|brolucius: He is looking for a sacrifice somewhere, but doubles instead of 4NT in case partner prefers to pass.|pg||
nt|stc: another big point !|pg||
nt|brolucius: Presumably North will pass.|pg||
nt|hedyg: trying to find a bid..|pg||
nt|barnets: in 3N defense have to try and stop dec making the 9th trick|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 3@D = 18+ with @D|pg||

nt|petergill: North loves to bid, but 3@S seems too pushy, to me|pg||
nt|Gerben42: will be Sementa thinking|pg||
nt|petergill: I wonder if it's N or E who is thinking?|pg||

nt|fabsayc: no surprise that south passed|pg||
nt|skorchev: with @C lead you take with @CA, play @D|pg||
nt|andyv:  makeable and able to bid it are 2 different things|pg||
pc|d3|nt|brolucius: North only worth false preference to 2@H.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: it's important to get yur prefixes and suffixes in the right place  |pg||
nt|andy_h: 3NT is a space consuming bid, so it probably shows 6+@S 14+ and a shortage in hearts (?)|pg||
nt|snetram:  szlemik w karo nie jest Åatwy do licytacji|pg||

nt|bjacobs: Well, she gets access to dummy's clubs, but not too clear what to throw on them|pg||
nt|paulg:  what would an undisciplined player call?|pg||

nt|barnets: needs very good defense to beat this contract|pg||

pc|dT|pg||
nt|brolucius: East can see that playing the jack will not assist his side's prospects.|pg||
nt|brolucius: South was marked with king or queen of clubs, since West would lead an honor from K-Q-x-x(-x).|pg||
nt|daman: 3NT loos like the par contract on this one|pg||
nt|daman: looks*|pg||
nt|daman: 2@C = Gazzilli|pg||
nt|bagman: South has two chances to play hearts before the elimination postion develops|pg||
nt|andyv:  Nunes and Fantoni made a killing at a NABC tourney in the US by playing 5 3N contracts holding 5-4 major suit fits... it was right every time!|pg||
nt|brolucius: At the other table North did make a trump trick, of course, but declarer was able to ditch two hearts on the established @CK-Q.|pg||
nt|petergill: EW have found a way to stay out of 4@S, which should fail (but only just)|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|pasker: safe lead from N|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@s for @d|pg||
nt|iain sime: Italy have turned a handy plus (probably) into minus.|pg||
nt|hedyg: he still had a @d loser and 1@s? how did he make 11 tricks?|pg||
nt|brolucius: Magic.|pg||
nt|hedyg: looks like he should have lost 1@H, 1@s and 1@d|pg||
nt|athene: right|pg||
nt|andyv:  somehow, needing 3-3 @d AND the Ace of @D on side AND trumps not to be 4-0 seems like a huge parlay|pg||
pc|s9|nt|Vugraphznk: Lauria had his pass on the tray then took it back, haha. Gotta love screens|pg||
nt|hedyg: he might double to show the value of the 1NT opening|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: "No bid"|pg||
nt|hedyg: depending on agreements|pg||
nt|hedyg: but that was when Bas had written 12-14 |pg||
nt|hedyg: he corrected that|pg||

nt|koksoy: play  is  easy|pg||
pc|d4|nt|bagman: N has troubles if they play odd=encouraging on the diamond switch|pg||
nt|petergill: Ew have few losers, but they lack tricks - 5@D on non trump leads might make 2 H's, 1 @C and 8 @D's I guess|pg||
nt|petergill: 4@H is interesting too|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Duboin: "Disgusting"|pg||
nt|babs59: yes - needs to ruff out the @CA too|pg||

pc|cK|nt|daman: 3NT = 5@S  4@C and not 3 @Hs|pg||
nt|iain sime: Bro Paolo would have made 12 ? :)|pg||
nt|bagman: without the trump lead declarer ruffs 2 spades and loses a trump trick in the process|pg||
pc|cA|nt|bridge_one: and @c|pg||
nt|Gerben42: what can he do|pg||
nt|barnets: if he can make 5@H tricks 4@D and a club |pg||
nt|barnets: seems a lot|pg||
nt|Gerben42: esp the combination of making 5@H and getting the @D through|pg||
nt|barnets: with the @D 4-1|pg||
nt|barnets: if the diamonds split|pg||
nt|petergill: The play looks complex - I hope the defence do not let Duboin's reaction affect their concentration (i.e. make them assume that the contract is hopeless)|pg||

nt|othered1: On @H lead, don't you get @H pitch on @S?|pg||
pc|c3|nt|hedyg: ohhhhh N didnt split his @s honours!|pg||
pc|c5|nt|bogier: z " O" PC ciê¿ko cos wyci¹gn¹æ w licytacji|pg||
nt|pasker: S will need to play a @H through at some point to avoid N being potentially endplayed|pg||
nt|athene: a trump or club ace would keep them alive, but spade is normal|pg||
pc|cT|nt|daman: this is a Roland slam which just might come home   even with the bad trumps|pg||
nt|bagman: anyhow, this is going to be double digit swing for Italy|pg||
nt|Gerben42: if you can ruff 4@S in dummy and @D 3-2 you would get 6 or 7 @H perhaps|pg||
nt|petergill: I predict 4@h will fail and will take a very very long time to be played|pg||
nt|Gerben42: he will try that I guess|pg||
nt|cicus: dangerous though it may have been|pg||
nt|athene: double of 3@D would have worked very well, yes :)|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|jtr: I rather prefer the 1NT rebid by South What do you think?|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|brolucius: He was obviously considering it. No idea, really, which is better.|pg||
nt|jtr: Limits the hand and has nice honour holdings to be led round to|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes.|pg||
nt|brolucius: You have persuaded me.|pg||
nt|jtr: Damn I was hoping to get you into an arguement:)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Discuss it with David Burn if that is what you want...|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: Haha, I see where you're coming from David|pg||
nt|kiwi_joker: either way it's a whole bunch more to Italy|pg||
nt|sharkey: Trump return seemed natural|pg||
nt|sharkey: 2nd trick|pg||
nt|brolucius: In case the final deal is very exciting, or over in a few seconds, I will take this opportunity to thank our wonderful VG operator, Bas. Many thanks!|pg||
nt|bagman: Does west believe that the @DK sits in where it is?|pg||
nt|hedyg: was taking a nap :(|pg||
pc|d9|nt|daman: E shd duck|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: N knows the @Cs are 5-0|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Looking rather worried lol|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: OR playing 6@C as well, I'm being told|pg||
nt|daman: this will probably take some time|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 36 minutes left on the clock|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Plenty o' that|pg||
nt|daman: beaucoup|pg||
nt|athene: the known diamond break is bad news for trying to set up diamonds or trying to crossruff|pg||
nt|athene: versace might be considering whether he can set up spades|pg||
nt|athene: but the problem is, he has the weak trumps, so he doesn't really want to use dummy's trumps for ruffing|pg||
nt|daman: 6@C -2 in the OR|pg||
nt|daman: he will finesse a H first|pg||
nt|andy_h: This will be 11 imps to Italy|pg||
nt|hedyg: probably being upset about the A@c play|pg||
nt|hedyg: why not @s back?|pg||
pc|h6|nt|bagman: Especially after the lead|pg||
nt|brolucius: Thanks as well to my fellow commentators Carl and Pekka. All the excitement came at the start. I ahve never seen so many big swings in a sequence.|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Thanks David, 't has been fun|pg||
nt|bagman: S did not return a @D so T is unlikely singleton|pg||
nt|bagman: OK, easy|pg||
nt|Gerben42: in other news: Germany 1 - England 0|pg||
nt|barnets: sounds ok to me|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Nice|pg||
nt|athene: but the italian style is not to make many lead doubles|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|jtr: I will, just after i finish sticking needles in my eyes|pg||
nt|brolucius: Hah!|pg||
nt|andyv:  that was not right |pg||
pc|hK|nt|daman: gag|pg||
nt|stc: good play now, @s helps dec|pg||
nt|bagman: Only safe  re-entry is @HA and heart|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h2|nt|athene: they think it helps opponents more, on balance|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|h3|nt|brolucius: Good tactics psychologically to fail to split spade honours. Makes missing the game look worse. But such clever manoeuvres are better early in a match.|pg||
nt|stc: K@S the last safe exit card|pg||
pc|h4|pc|s2|nt|bridge_one: more easy to beat 4@S that 3Nt|pg||
nt|petergill: He might be hoping for @D's 3-2 and complete crossruff = 9 tricks - 10 tricks fails when @d's breaks 4-1 |pg||
nt|Gerben42: i know because I live there and suddenly outside got VERY loud |pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|c6|nt|bagman: Bocchi leaves the @HA for his partner|pg||
nt|brolucius: Maybe the Great Dealer will end the session with a flourish. Another big deal right at the end.|pg||
pc|c8|nt|brolucius: I wonder if they have saved us something splendid for the last board.|pg||
nt|andyv:  nice of him:)|pg||
nt|hedyg: but when your pd showed out on @s not such great tactics ?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Nice|pg||
nt|stc: Madala should have cashed the @hs before @c|pg||
nt|hedyg: then Mossop could play K@s|pg||
pc|s8|pc|c7|pg||
pc|h9|nt|iain sime: Queen, spade ruff, heart, heart.|pg||
nt|stc: yes but he is endplay again, he makes only 2@c|pg||
nt|brolucius: Bocchi's decision to bid 5@C is still a bit puzzling. It would have been interesting to know how he came to that decision. Perhaps he placed South with a better hand.|pg||
pc|h7|pc|s5|pc|hQ|pg||
nt|hedyg: last board of this match now|pg||
nt|gulyas: x would have been probably for t/o|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|cQ|nt|andy_h: Concentrate Bas!|pg||
nt|bagman: N has no reason to keep the diamonds|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|petergill: Pow - there goes declarer's hopes|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Pow, there went Duboin's @DK|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: To the other side of the screen|pg||
nt|Gerben42: but I think it was the best chance|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
pc|sA|nt|sharkey: and Slovakia may win the 2nd half of this match - and good luck in the football games coming up|pg||

nt|lesniak: nieprzyjemny wynik dla Polski ale szwedzi zagrali swietnego brydza|pg||
nt|andyv:  West rushed this a bit... by playing K@D and A@d and then @S, if N ruffs, then she is endplayed|pg||
mb|p|nt|jtr: Hmmm Not really|pg||
nt|brolucius: Could be worse.|pg||
nt|vugraphznk: If the E hand could be my average, I'd sign up|pg||
nt|jtr: They might play it in 1NT just for you David|pg||
nt|hedyg: if S had bid 3@h (splinter) then maybe......|pg||
nt|hedyg: last board of this match now|pg||
nt|mdgraham: last board. It's been pretty unavailing for the Lithuanians, I'm afraid|pg||
nt|paulg:  an excellent performance so far by Scotland|pg||
nt|brolucius: South clearly thought that 3@C was conventional at the other table.|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Isn't the W hand a LV 2@D opener?|pg||
nt|hedyg: we will be back in 72 minutes|pg||
nt|brolucius: He must have thought North held both majors. But you would expect 3@D would be explained as showing hearts.|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes it is he upgraded|pg||
nt|brolucius: There is not space here to explain the full reasoning behind the 7@C bid.|pg||
nt|stc: 7@c in OR was intended as choose between @c and @s but not understood as such|pg||
nt|stc: 6@d was simpler to understand|pg||
nt|hedyg: he could have tried 6 @s...|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Versace possibly thought 3@D was natural too, because of the explanation he got that 3@C were both majors|pg||
nt|brolucius: Bocchi-Madala will expect to handle the North/South cards somewhat better.|pg||
nt|iain sime: Might be a pick up v. 7@H !|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Why would you give partner that choice when he already selected spades? By a jump even|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: South and West are screen mates|pg||
nt|petergill: Exactly what Latvia wanted, a few more imps for a nice respectable result about mighty Italy|pg||

nt|barnets: henkinbridge.com/Entertainment/Default.aspx?categoryID=3|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: Thanks Hedy, it has been a real surprise :)|pg||

nt|petergill: On Bd 19, EW are in 4@S at the other table - will it go down?|pg||

nt|Vugraphznk: I'm with you on that one Andy|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty Bas for great job|pg||
nt|rodvenn: Norway has bid 2 slams on questionable values. |pg||
nt|brolucius: Not a very good game. Let's see if the Italians can stop low.|pg||
nt|bagman: 4@H is quite awful contract; can EW stay out of it?|pg||
nt|antoniz: a 4pik|pg||
nt|vasmar: maybe Italy doesn't get 25Vps|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thanks to Bas, great job as usual!|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And to all our excellent commentators|pg||
nt|stc: perhaps was not sure about 4@s, natural or short ?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Mossop alerted 3@D but then took it back|pg||
nt|petergill: Latvia is still well placed to qualify, having already played Iceland, Italy, Germany and Bulgaria|pg||
nt|gluckenval: url splitted :(|pg||
nt|hedyg: we will be back tomorrow at 9 30 local time |pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: And thank you for being here today, sharing your comments with us :)|pg||

nt|petergill: Can they reach 4@H?|pg||

nt|tez: ty all:)|pg||
nt|jkotor: 3@h x -1?|pg||
nt|petergill: A very easy 620 to finish|pg||

pc|sK|nt|jtr: Having already shown a minimum|pg||
nt|bagman: @SA @HAK club |pg||
nt|bjacobs: Can he end in a blaze of glory?  The bidding is very informative|pg||

nt|jbgood: another good result for Italy coming in now - 3 NT in the other room was "a bit" high..|pg||
nt|bagman: Not exactly the friendiest of layouts for W|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the open of 1@D would work better here|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: "Lauria has left the table"|pg||
nt|Gerben42: if they pinpoint the @S problem...|pg||
nt|petergill: 2NT forcing|pg||

nt|andyv:  the Italian team has played very well... the Irish tead did have some chances|pg||
nt|mdgraham: looks like just three losers |pg||
nt|petergill: 4@SX would be 500 I think|pg||
pc|sA|nt|brolucius: 4@D a cue-bid with heart agreed.|pg||
nt|bagman: Normally they would be nice but facing this bad suit they are not that useful|pg||
nt|brolucius: Not easy to stop low because there are so many hands to be covered by relatively few sequences and it is not possible to discover that much about each hand.|pg||
nt|bagman: Getting plus here is worth 8 IMPs|pg||
nt|bagman: Going one down is worth 3|pg||
nt|brolucius: East must at least be thinking about passing 3@H.|pg||
nt|hedyg: Mossop might wake up now to the transfer?|pg||
nt|hedyg: no|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: But Mossop didn't wholeheartedly|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Please stick around as I will show the missed board 16|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok we will!|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Mossop explaining now that 3@D was undiscussed|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So the 1700 will not be that costly; this is only a question of an overtrick or not|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 6 or 7 IMPs|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Mossop saying he took 3@D as constructive with @D|pg||
nt|iain sime: Italy have missed the save , but will still pick up 7 imps or so.|pg||
nt|hedyg: you dont expect opps to overcall 2NT thus dont discuss your bids in case they do?|pg||
nt|stc: 6@s probably -800|pg||
nt|hedyg: push opps into making grand?|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: 6 or 7 IMPs won't matter for the VP score: 21:9|pg||
pc|s7|nt|brolucius: East still sees at least two holes unless partner can bid again. Well bid.|pg||
nt|jtr: East has too many hooles to be interested even if the @d cue was the Ace|pg||
nt|jtr: holes|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, they bid it well. (Famous last words as West raises to 6@H...)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: And West has done enough too with his aceless hand|pg||
nt|jtr: lol|pg||
nt|Walddk2: He already encouraged with 4@D|pg||
nt|brolucius: Yes, but he does have five trumps, which makes the singleton spade a little more attractive than it would otherwise have been.|pg||
nt|brgpro: what is W thinking about?|pg||
nt|jtr: Bidding a 'Roland' slam|pg||
nt|brolucius: Maybe what he should bid next.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: If East can't take an initiative over 4@D, West can't bid on in my opinion|pg||
nt|hedyg: we will be back in 75 minutes|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Thanks Hedy, fellow commentators and kibs! I can only hope you liked it as much as me :)|pg||
nt|bagman: Fast 11 tricks|pg||
nt|stc: then 7@s for -1100|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|atabey: TY Hedy my colleges and spectators|pg||
nt|brolucius: bravo!|pg||
nt|bridge_one: but in italian system 1@D means 4+cards unbalanced|pg||
nt|andyv:  something wrong with a system that misses the 5-4 fit for the 5-2|pg||
nt|bagman: 2@C artificial, I guess|pg||
pc|dA|nt|Vugraphznk: My pleasure Roland, I enjoyed it :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Next round in 50 minutes|pg||
nt|xenya: thanks everyone|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Italy v Slovakia|pg||
nt|jbgood: bye all |pg||
nt|Walddk2: Lebanon v France|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Austria v Netherlands|pg||
nt|andy_h: In an uncontested auction, N/S play some form of gazzilli after 1@D-1M-2@C showing either a natural club suit or 16+|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Israel v Ireland|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Italy Slovakia 2-3? :)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Denmark v Sweden (women)|pg||
nt|andy_h: either 1NT is 12-16 or Bocchi "downgraded" to 12-14 based on his singleton spade. Triple-four-one hands are always hard to bid|pg||
nt|cicus: 2NT doesn't|pg||
nt|andyv:  N did think about it.  S did bid 2@s on his own so he is pretty sure S has 4 @s and nothing else.|pg||
nt|skorchev: looks like North is short of entries to take all finesses|pg||
nt|koksoy: bye..|pg||
pc|d3|nt|jtr: But 6 is rather too good for him|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and he realised that eventually|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thanks all, back in 1 hour and a wee bit|pg||
nt|Gerben42: impressive|pg||
nt|petergill: They pinpointed the spade problem, as one expects from these Italians|pg||
nt|gulyas: 2NT may not|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: cos odrobimy|pg||
pc|d5|nt|Gerben42: playing like this they are among the big favorites|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Another 4@H by EW in a 7 card fit :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: surely 2NT was not natural|pg||
nt|athene: 2nt is a bad spot, as usual|pg||
nt|jkotor: pik do skrótu?|pg||
nt|bogier: :)|pg||
nt|antoniz: dziêki, do us³yszenia:)|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that's not the best possible start...|pg||
nt|iain sime: thanks Bas and all. Bye. |pg||
nt|hedyg: 64 minutes :)|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Thanks Iain|pg||
pc|d4|nt|snetram:  Moim zdaniem E powinien walczyc - 4NT|pg||
nt|bogier: Polki przegra³y Francuzkom 5 pik X w tym rozdaniu|pg||
nt|andyv:  in Belgium|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: England - Ukraine have only compared 4 boards!|pg||
pc|d6|nt|brolucius: Good entertainment today - an excellent set of boards.|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes lots of fun :(|pg||
nt|barnets: http://www.shenkinbridge.com/    some asked me to repeat|pg||
nt|Gerben42: again from Duboin|pg||
nt|athene: i don't know how NS play it but most experts treat all these 2nt bids as artificial, usually showing two places to play|pg||
nt|cicus: without @Cs N has only 6 tricks|pg||
nt|jkotor: gib mówi, ¿e to chodzi|pg||
nt|bogier: pozory myl¹|pg||
pc|h2|nt|antoniz: czemu nie przez kiery?|pg||
nt|gulyas: this going down 2|pg||

nt|daman: running scores Group A    http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/runningscores/asp/roundteamsconditstatclassicmod.asp?qtournid=819&qshowflag=1|pg||
nt|pasker: maybe versace could have chosen to play in @Ds instead|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty Bas for your wonderful work and ty Barbara, it's been a pleasure.  And a big thanks to all the specs who make this a most enjoyable way to spend a couple of hours.|pg||
pc|h5|nt|snetram:  5 trefli - praktycznie bez jednej|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Duboin probably had his reasons to pass|pg||
pc|h7|nt|andy_h: In the Open Room, the Norwegian N/S pair had an uncontested auction to 3NT after North decided to reverse with 2@H|pg||
nt|sharkey: may make if guess @H|pg||
nt|skorchev: maybe some problem with Bridgemate?|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|Vugraphznk: Thank you all, be back later, good night Andy :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  ty Bas|pg||
nt|andyv:  good night all|pg||
nt|fabsayc: 70-68 isner|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|bagman: Well guessed|pg||
nt|bagman: Now he makes for 8 IMPs|pg||
nt|andyv:  not sure how he could do it|pg||
nt|petergill: Thanks to Matthias Berghaus and Mike Graham for their comments and to Bas for being one of the best operators around|pg||
nt|mdgraham: second that|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: Thanks Peter, and thank you for your sharing of your wit with us despite the late hour :)|pg||
nt|petergill: Anyone know why Versace doubled 3@S instead of simply bidding 4@H?|pg||
nt|ziff:  And to Peter and all the kibitzers, who keep us busy and make it fun|pg||
nt|mdgraham: possibly to show two places to play |pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hK|nt|petergill: He was a passed hand - perhaps he was showing a maximum 4@H bid in case slam was on?|pg||
pc|s3|nt|jtr: A close well-fought match|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes they are not doubled yet|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|jkotor: ale ju¿ -1|pg||
mc|10|nt|hedyg: OMG!|pg||
nt|hedyg: will they ever stop?|pg||
nt|fabsayc: its over|pg||
nt|gulyas: he was not sure they have a @C fit?|pg||
nt|bagman: The trump lead is helpful. Declarer draws trumps and sets up the clubs|pg||
nt|mdgraham: although holding five hearts 4@H is likely to be as good a spot as any - also, East might be enormous and EW may have a slam |pg||
nt|ziff:  They always keep slam in the picture....|pg||
nt|mdgraham: thanks all.|pg||
nt|Vugraphznk: I think he wouldnt mind if partner passes with say 2344|pg||
nt|petergill: Thanks to EBL and to anyone in Ostend Belgium who made this broadcast possible|pg||
nt|ziff:  Thanks all, one more round to go in the qualification|pg||
