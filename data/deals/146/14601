nt|ahollan1: convention cards for all but 1 pair in the finals online   follow link for specific team under  http://usbf.org/index.php?option=com_entries&event=18&task=list|pg||
nt|kit: Pass by Gitelman should be forcing here I think, and if he does Moss can bid 5@H|pg||
nt|me argent: with no distributional storms|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|Vugraphzfd: hello everyone,   I got here late and I dont know which minor west opened :   guessed @D because of lead|pg||
nt|me argent: it takes an unlikely @S lead to beat 5@Hs|pg||
nt|kit: But he chose to show preference for defending -- questionable|pg||
pc|d4|nt|Vugraphzfd: Hampson says:  I hope you are not club short|pg||

pc|d6|nt|robinswr: i like the random game try that stansby used|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|sharynr: Hi all ... |pg||
nt|me argent: weinstein gives a good description of his hand with natural 4nt bid|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|passell: a major suit lead might have given him little chance now it looks like no chance at all|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Thanks for joining us Mike (passell) always nice to have a Hall of Famer helping with the play  by play|pg||
nt|me argent: with @Cs splitting declarer will have no problem|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Good morning and welcome all|pg||
pc|h2|nt|kjadams: declarer might overtake heart Q here.|pg||
nt|sharynr: great lead, cuts what little he had in communication|pg||
pc|d2|nt|passell: notice east would need to signal since if his card was the club king instead of the heart king they would haVE TO CONTINUE SPADES TO BEAT IT|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|ahollan1: you can watch all other vugraph tables using http://www.bbotv.com/vugraph/    the Juniors are NOT playing same boards as Open|pg||

pc|sA|pc|sJ|pc|s8|pc|s6|pg||
nt|me argent: not sure if pass by north would have been forcing|pg||
nt|kit: Looks like declarer can set up the diamonds and make -- those 5-5 fits play nicely|pg||
nt|kit: how could it not be forcing -- North showed invite values, and South bid voluntary game|pg||
nt|me argent: south hasnt showen def wiyh 4@Hs so why is pass forcing kit?|pg||
nt|me argent: all north has done is say i have a good hand for @Hs|pg||
nt|kit: South didn't have to bid 4@H, since opponents only in 3@C -- so 4@H bid is to make, so force exists|pg||
nt|me argent: and south said fine lets try 4@Hs|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h4|pc|hK|nt|me argent: random?|pg||

nt|chorush: Gitelman will do some exploratory work in diamonds after pitching one and discover the ak in north. I predict he will make this|pg||

nt|chorush: if true will be 10 imps to diamond|pg||

nt|reisig: Levin's lead ...might tell the story|pg||
pc|h3|nt|passell: 12 imp swing on guess|pg||
nt|chorush: John Gowdy thinks the opening lead told the tale|pg||
nt|passell: he wouldnt lead from QJ10xxx with Qxx in hearts? |pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: that may be true -- however holding Qxxx@H and QJTx(xx) of clubs, Levin would probably lead the same|pg||
nt|reisig: I'll stick to my 1st guess :)|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: oops, added one too many hearts there|pg||
nt|ritong: the location of the @h 10 is unknown|pg||
nt|poohbear: well there is also the issue of declarer's @d pitch. Without the @h 10 he might have pitched a @h . So Weinstein knows it is safe to lead from the Q|pg||
pc|h5|pc|hA|pc|h9|pg||
nt|ritong: declarer is known with 6@s and 1 @c|pg||
nt|chorush: from North's point of view, not able to see the heart 10 this could be a grovesnor with the heart Q|pg||
nt|reisig: Great job!|pg||

nt|kit: if South thinks he can make 4@H, then how bad can it be to compete to 5@H if both players believe their hands are more suited for offense than defense?|pg||
mb|3C|nt|chorush: This hand appears to be an easy 4 spades for NS, with the diamond ace right|pg||
nt|harmon: new leader|pg||
nt|me argent: EW in OR obviously had none on that hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: looking at all hands -- attacking @C would have let contract make - but i think playing @H gave better chance of going down ONLY 1 |pg||
nt|ahollan1: and no reason @HKx couldn't be in west|pg||
nt|kit: Just because we are in a force doesn't mean it is our hand -- sometimes the pair in the force is the one taking the save|pg||
nt|me argent: same contract in OR|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: another [ugly?] upgrade to 14|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: many pointing out  low @C [not cashing Ace] before @H finesse better -- works in actual case and @H finesse still available if @C not good|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharynr: i guess he didnt overtake the heart, then had no entry left for the 4th one|pg||
nt|me argent: must admit i am a 2@C overcaller with souths hand a TOX wouldnt enter my mind|pg||
nt|sharynr: i am with you Joey|pg||
nt|robinswr: nice when you make a t/o double with 5diamonds and partner bids diamonds|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lml: they will end in 4@S whatever north opened|pg||
nt|ahollan1: K&R  thinks north is worth all of 12.30    http://www.jeff-goldsmith.org/cgi-bin/knr.cgi|pg||
nt|lml: dies it count the nice 10's|pg||
nt|lml: does|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1N was 14-16   2@D= @H or @S|pg||
nt|me argent: EW get to test their slam bidding over a weak NT opening|pg||
pc|s8|nt|lml: I think it is 13 no more and no less|pg||
nt|me argent: on this auction east will accept all invitations|pg||
nt|kit: Should be pretty easy slam to bid -- making it might be another matter|pg||
nt|me argent: a rabbi could even make 5@Cs EW|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|algraves: hello|pg||
nt|lml: hi Allan|pg||
nt|ahollan1: yes -- K&R looks at 10s -- but really doesn't like Queens|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|henryb:  I mean the team names. Both of you have them backward|pg||
nt|lml: well they go better with the 10's|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|lml: in combination|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lml: they don't want to get too high here but I don't imagine they will|pg||
nt|lml: 4@S = safe but 5@S = not safe|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3@H could be "Baze"  @S raise, unspecified shortness|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 8 & 9 card suits have not been all that rare this week|pg||
nt|me argent: a rabbi would not get @D lead and a @S back|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ahollan1: then 4@C=1@C  [3N would be some void]|pg||
nt|lml: whatever they are doing they doing have the tickets for a slam|pg||
nt|kjadams: 5C takes the early Tap to beat.|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|sharynr: and they have found the lead!|pg||
nt|me argent: with souths hand why make double for takeout when you dont want partner to bid any suit but @Cs|pg||
nt|kit: I don't know if Martel's sequence is bidding out his pattern or what|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: I've hardtime reading the notes from where I am..all bids alerted|pg||
nt|kit: The slam can be made double-dummy, of course, by taking a winning heart or club finesse, but in practice I think it will go down|pg||
nt|kit: Most likely line is heart to king and pass 10 of hearts ....|pg||
pc|s9|nt|sharynr: any explanation to the 3@D bid Operator|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: no explanation given to 3d|pg||
nt|kjadams: finding the winning defense would be superhuman.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|sharynr: well that wont work!|pg||
nt|kjadams: undo|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: 3d actually by Diamond..I will correct|pg||
nt|3for3: They are slamming in Open room, and Kamil has doubled a 4@C bid, so that will make things easier for the @D Team|pg||
nt|kit: If declarer has judged to draw trumps first that will be okay, as he can take ruffing finesse.  If he didn't draw trumps, third round of hearts beats him.|pg||
nt|me argent: cant see them stopping short now|pg||
nt|me argent: in OR a 4@C Q bid was doubled by north|pg||
pc|c3|nt|ahollan1: NS using udca|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: as to the team names on the green vugraph bars:  yes the names are entered there reversed|pg||
nt|lml: 6 imps to Diamond when Greco-Hampson got a plus in a partscore on the previous deal|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: e-w lead 3rd from even, low from odd|pg||
nt|ahollan1: convention cards for 5 of 6 pairs in finals are available online  follow link for the team under http://usbf.org/index.php?option=com_entries&event=18&task=list|pg||
nt|lml: we can see that Greco is safe no matter what he does since Fleisher can only give Kamil one ruff|pg||
nt|ahollan1: !Q very loud scream for @S shift|pg||
nt|passell: the normal queen of clubs lead allow 4 spades to make on a winning heart guess|pg||
pc|c5|nt|me argent: its obvious what 3@Ds from east was|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c4|nt|ahollan1: @D9 2nd scream for @S|pg||
nt|robinswr: needs spade tricks to pitch his hearts|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h2|pc|h9|nt|ahollan1: say WHAT?|pg||
nt|me argent: an overbid|pg||
nt|kit: After Martel Q-bid Stansby decided he had a max, so he drove it in via RKC|pg||
nt|me argent: of course it would help if i read what other people wrot instead of just concentrating on my 1 finger typing:(|pg||
nt|kit: Gitelman will probably make passive diamond lead, as he has strong heart holding|pg||
nt|3for3: Fleisher led a low @C, covered all around, so that hand is done|pg||
nt|kit: The best line may be to start with heart to king.  If it holds, draw trumps and ride 10 of hearts, which almost has to work.  If loses to ace, then may have to try something else.|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|me argent: whoops|pg||
pc|hT|nt|kit: Well, this makes it very easy.  Gitelman is hoping his partner has a stiff heart -- certainly possible.|pg||
pc|h4|pc|c8|nt|Vugraphzfd: Greco has to guess the trump jack|pg||
nt|lml: yes he does but Kamil was less likely to lead a singleton with good trump so I think he will get it right|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Weinstein flew @HA then dropped @SJ|pg||
nt|lml: thats the easy way!|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: more info at other table where opening lead was dummy's suit.   Here Fleisher's non-double of 3@H lulled declarer into playing low|pg||
nt|3for3: Gitelman was hoping for partner to have a stiff @H, certainly reasonable|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
mc|8|nt|Vugraphzfd: I will check with COO and see what to do|pg||

nt|mildredb: nice suit pref @H9 by Levin|pg||
nt|ritong: the @h 9 is not a falsecarding try, it means " ability to ruff"|pg||

nt|algraves: or switch after 2@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 14-16|pg||
nt|me argent: the open and closed rooms are good examples on why to bid agressive slams the opening lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: notice over the nebulous 1@D how Kamil's DBL focuses just on majors|pg||
nt|lml: its probably easiest to do if West is on lead |pg||

nt|reisig: 3@hX is better :)|pg||
nt|me argent: think levin much too strong for his preempt|pg||
nt|me argent: brave 2@S bid by moss|pg||
nt|kit: I have never understood the purpose of overcalling 1@S on a hand like North's.  2@S I can see, but what good can come of 1@S?|pg||
mb|p|nt|lml: so two chances to find the ruff|pg||
nt|lml: the first is the easiest|pg||

pc|s6|nt|ahollan1: Moss opened the west hand   Martel obviously likes better 12 counts for unfav 1N|pg||
nt|passell: a lot of imps will gdepend on the heart guess on board 107|pg||
pc|sA|nt|ahollan1: hampson might try 3 rounds of @C [with finesse]|pg||
nt|lml: good point Al|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in the other room Weinstein in 5@D  --  that won't fetch either|pg||
nt|algraves: it really is an " obvious " singleton |pg||
nt|kit: Moss will probably defend with his 4-3-3-3 shape|pg||
pc|s5|nt|3for3: Both pairs miss the good game here.  Not clear anyone did anything terrible though|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|robinswr: some play that there are rules when bids promise a fit. my rule is that 2/3 passed hand, partner shows 6, 4level|pg||
nt|harmon: 3rds clubs very good here|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|h2|nt|robinswr: martel plays 12-14 notrumps |pg||
pc|h6|nt|algraves: so he will do that I think|pg||
pc|hQ|pg||
nt|robinswr: ace of clubs should say lead a heart |pg||
nt|robinswr: ak of clubs are equals|pg||
nt|me argent: it says dont lead a @D|pg||
nt|robinswr: he is a passed hand with the AK of clubs so he can't have much more|pg||
nt|me argent: moss does not want partner underleading his @DA|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|me argent: for obvious reasons|pg||
pc|sT|pc|sQ|nt|sharynr: it's called "mixing it up" Joey|pg||

pc|cJ|pc|c2|pc|c8|pg||
nt|kit: Problem at this table was that Martel could have been real light for the 3rd seat opening, so Stansby felt right to pass 3@C|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: final contract is 3@C West -- that should be an interesting race|pg||
nt|robinswr: martel has shown up with 2 aces and is a passed hand so he can't(shouldn't) have the ace of diamonds|pg||

mb|2C|nt|poohbear: Moss could have tried for a swing by passing out the board|pg||
mb|2S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|cT|nt|poohbear: Basically swinging is just trying to take actions that are contrary to the other table if its close and then hoping luck is with you|pg||

nt|kit: this contract might not be making, and if it doesn't, that's 5 more imps to Diamond|pg||

nt|chorush: some kibs are claiming that he shoul dhave thrown 2 hearts on ak of clubs but that wont fly with the spade break|pg||
mb|1S|nt|kjadams: against my preempts it's right to pass with North hand.   Seems not so vs Levin|pg||
nt|me argent: are vwe nt or @C bidders with south hand?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 1@C=16+ unbal or 17+ bal  [not 19-20 bal]|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's a worthy 12-14|pg||

nt|lml: Hampson cant love the turn this auction has taken... how to get in the minors...|pg||
nt|me argent: and i like 3@Ds|pg||
nt|robinswr: and if partner complains, just say that you had a diamond in with your spades|pg||
nt|me argent: response|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 2@D=@D & @H/@S|pg||
nt|robinswr: 3diamonds shows a spade fit and asks for a diamond lead|pg||
pc|s3|nt|robinswr: the problem with DONT is that you don't know the lengths of the two suits|pg||
pc|s4|nt|me argent: 3@Hs = 5@Ss and 4@Hs|pg||
nt|3for3: Perhaps Martel should have competed earlier....maybe via a good bad 2nt|pg||
nt|me argent: will he or wont he?|pg||
nt|3for3: He will I guess|pg||
nt|me argent: i know i couldnt pass|pg||
nt|kit: If he wants to compete, much safer to make immediate takeout double IMO|pg||
nt|kit: Since partner passed hand, partner can't bury you in too deep a grave|pg||
nt|me argent: danger alot less when west has showen a limited fit|pg||
pc|sT|nt|chorush: dangerous spot for Levin to double but his side can make 2 or 3 spades|pg||
nt|kjadams: kib points out that best def does set the last hand|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|kit: I disagree -- more danger when opponents have described their hands to each other|pg||
nt|me argent: moss agrees with you kit|pg||
nt|kit: And a potential double part-score swing from South's silence, as 2@S and 3 of something might well be making|pg||
pc|s7|nt|lml: a good disciplined pass I think|pg||
nt|robinswr: 3diamonds could be bid on AQx|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lml: this should go down after a heart lead|pg||
nt|lml: he cant get enough pitches for his hearts without the opposition ruffing|pg||
nt|algraves: so this is the killing lead and North will just play normally , pitch a heart and play spades. He has no reason not to expect 7 @H|pg||
nt|algraves: so he is reluctant to duck first heart|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Gitelman doubled 4@S|pg||
nt|kit: Also, immediate takeout double only commits us to 2-level, while delayed double forces to 3-level -- big consideration as far as safety is concerned|pg||
nt|chorush: took diamond lead to beat 5 clubs|pg||
nt|me argent: 4@Cs on time|pg||
nt|robinswr: turns out you need a diamond lead to hold it to 4|pg||
pc|s6|nt|kjadams: sky 1st club and arrange for 2 diamond ruffs with spade as entry.|pg||
nt|me argent: always a mistake to double a partscore when best one can do is beat it 1 wiith perfect defence too many accidents can happen|pg||
nt|me argent: change the blackQs and it would have been double partscore|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|kjadams: yes.  I am sure North wanted to bid "undouble"|pg||
pc|sA|nt|henryb:  Weinstein needs an uppercut to get three trumps to go with three aces|pg||
pc|s5|pc|c3|nt|chorush: look like diamond should start with the spade K|pg||
nt|kit: btw I agree with Moss's actions -- just pointing out that it is better to double immediately than to wait|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Diamond 1N=good 13-16    Martel's NT would be 12-14  will he open 1N or 1@D? |pg||
nt|ahollan1: i think just coincidence that 2@D bid corresponds to DONT    actually 2minor = minor + unknown major|pg||
nt|robinswr: same principle|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c8|nt|chorush: If I were Martel, I might think the trick taking potential of this hand is more than 14|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cJ|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c6|pc|cA|nt|me argent: east just has given declarer a chance to go down 2|pg||

nt|kit: in fact, it appears hearts were continued, so hear is good in dummy and declrarer can make if he just doesn't take spade finesse|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfd: Bd 95 was good result for EW..madeon a trump coup|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Board 95 was fouled in duplication and a substitute board was played on which EW made 4@h at this table. The board is still being played at the other table.|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: We should be starting the final segment very shortly after the other table finishes play|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: even if north reads the trump -- would need west to follow to 3@C to ditch @H loser|pg||
mb|1S|nt|algraves: yes he played normally with hope for sucess if hearts were 7-1|pg||
nt|me argent: 5@Cs yes 5@Ds no|pg||
mb|3H|nt|me argent: predict 5@Hs final contract|pg||
nt|kit: 9-bagger, but probably flat board as E-W can't do much do to vulnerbility|pg||
nt|passell: this could be interesting|pg||
mb|3N|nt|robinswr: hampson has a balanced hand this time|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and a pinochle|pg||
nt|robinswr: stansby will double showing diamonds|pg||
nt|chorush: will be hard to locate over 4H|pg||
nt|po-s: 4NT...|pg||
nt|me argent: martel aint buying it at the 4level|pg||
nt|chorush: yes PO 4NT would be useful if not RKC|pg||
nt|po-s: 5C? spade lead|pg||
nt|robinswr: it would be hard to play in clubs here since the most like followup is to try to get to slam|pg||
nt|me argent: yes po but partner did bid @Hs anyways no way NS can get to 5@Cs|pg||
nt|chorush: and as per Olav points out a spaade would beat 5 clubs although it will never happen|pg||
nt|me argent: exactly ira|pg||
mb|p|nt|chorush: Having talked a lot with Steve at this tournament, I know that he is a strong proponent of leaving doubles like this one in. It is not the major disaster that 2 of a major would ...|pg||
nt|chorush: be, but a possible adverse swing of 7 imps|pg||
nt|robinswr: five+ diamonds and he hopes to bid spades next|pg||
mb|4C|nt|lml: or the @S9 was onside|pg||
nt|algraves: so the big clubbers get to practice their methods|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 1@H=8-11 HCP, any shape|pg||
nt|kit: If 4NT is regular Blackwood, that's what I think Moss should have bid|pg||
nt|kit: Even right-sides the contract when partner has 2 aces|pg||
nt|me argent: or 4@Cs regular gerber|pg||
nt|kit: Plus, what fun to say:  Bet you'll never get this good trump support, as he puts down the dummy|pg||
nt|chorush: well this is one way to reach 5 clubs if it is interpreted as natural|pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: 2spades probably shows a doubleton spade and 4 hearts|pg||
nt|robinswr: stansby could have bid 2hearts (Michaels) but he wanted to get his lead director in|pg||
nt|algraves: hello again bridge fans|pg||
nt|ahollan1: welcome canada|pg||
nt|robinswr: 2spades might have been hampsons only superaccept if 2diamonds didn't promise hearts and was a 2-way convention|pg||
mb|4S|nt|3for3: Kit is not a big fan of worrying about 5 level jeopardy, but it seems there should be some way of staying off the 5 level when you have all that bidding space.|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves: so NS can make 2H|pg||
nt|passell: 6spades a lucky make |pg||
nt|passell: stansby would have to shift to a diamond at trick 2 to beat it|pg||
mb|5H|nt|me argent: should make 4@Hs|pg||
nt|passell: otherwise he can ruff 1 club in the dummy and make it on a minor suit squeeze|pg||
nt|robinswr: what is greco going to bid over 5hearts|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: this auction protects against immediate @D attack -- but there is plenty of time|pg||
nt|robinswr: i think that when greco declines the invitation, stansby should bid his spades|pg||
nt|me argent: draw trumps 4 rds of @Ss pitch a minor|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Daimond: Could be 19|pg||
nt|robinswr: if spades were 4-2 and the spades block 5diamonds might be made|pg||
nt|chorush: yes that is declarer's only hope|pg||
mb|5N|nt|algraves: EW a lot of spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Levin opened 1N as good 14-17, Weinstein Texas transfers into 4@H|pg||
nt|robinswr: his partner is marked for values if the opponents don't get to game|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Gitelman doubled and again  North becomes declarer  and both lead @CJ|pg||
nt|kit: Problem with this approach is that partner won't like his potential weak heart holding, so might not cooperate when slam is there|pg||
mb|p|nt|chorush: slightly conservative rebid and NS will miss the aggressive 4 heart contract that would make on a good day|pg||
nt|passell: he would like to bid 6dia to play if his partner was 6025 |pg||
mb|6C|nt|lml: 6@H wouldnt be bad if Hampson just had the @CK instead of the queen|pg||
nt|me argent: best line to make 5@Ds is having the @HA led out of turn|pg||
nt|chorush: tad unlucky not to have dummy's majors 3-2 the other way|pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: moss will win the ace draw trumps ruff a heart play clubs and then lead a spade hoping that he gets a sluff-ruff|pg||
mb|6D|nt|chorush: one line (impossible on the bidding) is to rise hoping for spades 6-1 and discard spade on heart king|pg||
mb|p|nt|passell: he tried |pg||
mb|6S|nt|lml: they might make it on this layout depending on the lead|pg||
nt|algraves: meanwhile they can make at 5 @H from south , 4@S from north|pg||
nt|lml: without a diamond lead they can discard diamonds on spades and go about setting up clubs|pg||
nt|algraves: yes that is true|pg||
nt|algraves: but they really dont have the stuff to bid too much higher|pg||
nt|lml: no they shouldnt be there for sure|pg||
nt|lml: its just that if they get carried away in the auction they may luck out|pg||
nt|algraves: they might crawl up to 5 but that seems pushy|pg||
nt|algraves: we dont know what there bids mean in any depth, but they do undoubtedly . so all we can do is wait|pg||
nt|ahollan1: maybe JoAnna will learn if   a) 1N limits hand beyond 8-11 bal  b) 3@C agree @H|pg||
nt|lml: the thing is that from Greco's point of view 8-11 is enough if its the right cards|pg||
nt|lml: the @CK alone would make it decent add the a major jack and even better|pg||
mb|p|nt|3for3: Playing a variant of 2 way checkback, 3@H should say 'don't worry about trumps...I am slamming in hearts and just need controls...|pg||
nt|odysseus69: have smpathy with giant leap over 1s - not my choice but immediate 4NT could be winner|pg||
nt|kit: difficult to stop when you just want to ask for aces|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves: well he needs some key jacks to make it a good slam|pg||
nt|algraves: and the ace of diamonds|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: South passed initially and would have opened 1@D with bal 11 so South is limited|pg||
nt|lml: Fleisher can kill the whole thing if he leads the @DA if they do get to slam since the @Ck has to score|pg||
nt|algraves: JXX, KJXX, AXX  XXX is a good 6 hearts basically needing 3-2 trump|pg||
nt|odysseus69: hard to pass looking at your own hand but once you try any rational reconstruction....|pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: if 5nt was choice of slams then why did hampson bid 6clubs|pg||
nt|passell: dia shift obvious now |pg||
nt|robinswr: unless he leads a diamond on opening lead|pg||
pc|hA|nt|algraves: whatever 4@S was Hampson had had enough|pg||
nt|lml: he knew they could safely play in spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: key for me will be explanation of 3@C|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: North alerted 4@S,    and South did not alert 4@S     earlier bidding showed exactly 3@S4@H in south|pg||
nt|robinswr: but no redouble|pg||
nt|passell: unlucky J9 of spades for stansby other wise he could ruff 2 clubs|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: aha   thanks JoAnna|pg||
nt|algraves: so they had a key card misunderstanding here , Where is Eddie Kantar when they need him?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: it seems that 3@C was part of the pattern showing to describe 3-4 majors|pg||
pc|h3|nt|algraves: but they come out ok|pg||
nt|lml: perhaps the misunderstanding saved a bunch of imps or vice versa ... we will never know|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|robinswr: couldn't he be leading the ace without the king|pg||
nt|passell: good point|pg||
nt|robinswr: you want count |pg||

pc|hK|pc|hJ|pc|h5|nt|algraves: Kamil wants to overtake and play a third round for the over ruff|pg||

pc|s6|pg||
nt|passell: he will now|pg||
nt|passell: still not home|pg||
nt|robinswr: how could hampson do this with xx of hearts?|pg||
nt|robinswr: he has the squeeze now|pg||
nt|passell: I think stansby will score his spade j|pg||
nt|passell: he will have to ruff good heart and squeeze to make it  a good possibility|pg||
nt|robinswr: he has the extra heart trick now|pg||
nt|passell: but cant get off the dummy after club ruff|pg||
nt|passell: he might run trump for the squueze|pg||
nt|robinswr: if he guesses that stansby is 2722 he can just run the trumps|pg||
nt|passell: might lose to Jx of spades  lots of possibilities here|pg||
pc|cA|nt|lml: overruff overruffed|pg||
pc|c2|nt|algraves: but that means declarer made a soft play at ttrick one|pg||

nt|robinswr: and hampson needs a swing |pg||
pc|c7|pc|c6|pg||

nt|passell: Stansby can ruff 3rd club or pitch a dia|pg||
nt|passell: he must ruff to give him a problem|pg||

mb|p|pc|d5|nt|kit: in face, I think he should have done so here -- how else is he defeating the contract if East has slam interest|pg||
pc|d4|nt|chorush: that's a good though Kit; make one of Moss' diamonds a heart and a low heart would likely defeat the contract|pg||

nt|me argent: but in practise tough to beat even with declarers help|pg||
nt|kit: Martel has problem here, but will likely go up king.  10@H rusinow, so South should hold queen, and would Gitelman have led from J108xx with partner overcalling spades?|pg||
nt|me argent: if declarer ducks this @C switch best?|pg||
nt|robinswr: 22 imps if east had J32 of spades on the last hand|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|ahollan1: same in other room|pg||
nt|algraves: that will require some care|pg||
nt|robinswr: i'm going to have to teach moss the basic rule on notrump defense return partner's suit|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|algraves: well a 24 pt semi misfit|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|lml: I don't know I think Kamil is worth a try vulnerable|pg||
nt|kit: A low heart lead would have been more effective this time, but I can't fault Gitelman for choosing the 10|pg||
pc|sA|nt|algraves: Hampson realizes it is cold on 32 trumps so he will be thinking about 4-1|pg||
nt|algraves: the 7 of hearts is an interesing card|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @HA @S finesse?   @DA @S finesse  @H to 8/9?    any guesses|pg||
nt|robinswr: this is one of those hands that if you make it you played it well and if you went down you wonder why you didn't guess it|pg||
pc|s5|nt|chorush: perfect defense will yield down 2 here|pg||
nt|lml: but they can hold this to 3|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lml: the diamond lead was a good lead and they now need to play trumps|pg||
nt|kit: Now declarer can and will establish a spade trick for  9|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ahollan1: claim -- let opponents work it out|pg||
pc|s6|nt|robinswr: so stansby is a better partner than moss|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|kjadams: we have seen a good bit of underleading aces, with mostly no harm or gain|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|lml: in 4 not in 3|pg||
nt|me argent: now its all over except for the agony|pg||
nt|chorush: declarer flew with the K and Gitleman will not be happy that he led the 10|pg||
nt|chorush: on last hand in 3NT|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|chorush: the clb 10 return asked for a spade|pg||
nt|robinswr: heart to the 9 was not his best start|pg||
nt|robinswr: gitelman get's even doesn't return a club|pg||
nt|passell: it was this hand when played at the other table|pg||
pc|c3|pc|h3|nt|robinswr: martel should have split|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfd: asking how do hearts break?|pg||

mb|p|nt|chorush: Here is a grand where we could see a swing in how the spade suit is played|pg||
mb|1S|mb|2D|nt|niclecuyer: definitively a swing hand - let's see how they will cope with it|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: they are in 7@s in the CR|pg||
mb|p|mb|2S|mb|d|mb|3D!|nt|kit: Diamond team getting the deals they need, that's for sure|pg||
mb|3S|nt|poohbear: in Grand at the other table . over 1@c opening East preempted so a chance to get it right|pg||
nt|chorush: more than a chance I would say|pg||
mb|p|nt|kit: Chip led a trump!|pg||
nt|ritong: syarting with the lead if north declares|pg||
nt|ritong: bingo|pg||
nt|chorush: they got it right as they will here if they get to it|pg||
nt|vugraphzfk: we'll see how they do over here -- rates to be a nice swing to Diamond, but may be too little too late|pg||
nt|kit: Weinstein knows his partner didn't raise initially, so pretty hard to imagine there could be a grand slam|pg||
nt|niclecuyer: it would be surprising they get to 7Sp here|pg||
nt|chorush: kibs are telling me they led a trump against 7 spades. then he gets it right for sure:)|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|nt|poohbear: I wonder if declarer was counting on that when he didnt ask for trump Q|pg||
mb|5C|mb|p|mb|6S|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dA|pc|d4|pc|d9|pc|s4|pg||

nt|me argent: important to play 3rd hand high when playing with some with those tendencies|pg||
nt|me argent: 1nt 3nt?|pg||
nt|robinswr: he set up an extra club trick or an extra heart trick to make four|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|me argent: someone|pg||
mb|2D|mb|3C|nt|me argent: nope east is a man wiyh disipline|pg||
nt|passell: 7 hearts a decent contract here|pg||
mb|3D|mb|3S|nt|Vugraphzfd: Levin is pondering his options|pg||
nt|passell: looks like a heart lead will beat 3nt  4spades no play|pg||
nt|kjadams: yes.  As Hamman put it after zia underled... He did not want to make a discovery play only to discover he had made the wrong play.|pg||
nt|3for3: Matel will offer choice of games|pg||
nt|kit: Stansby can open 1@D with no rebid problems holding spade suit|pg||
nt|me argent: oey i nate that convention and over @Ds yet ech|pg||
nt|passell: will be hard to get to with this competition|pg||
nt|robinswr: 3diamonds seems cowardly|pg||
nt|passell: hard to get both suits in|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: any chance Levin PASS?|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i guess so :)|pg||
nt|chorush: I would pass with Levins hand|pg||
nt|robinswr: hampson must have missorted his hand and didn't see that he had 5 hearts|pg||
mb|4S|nt|ahollan1: now DBL-P-2@H-2@S|pg||
nt|me argent: hate|pg||
nt|robinswr: i love support doubles|pg||
mb|p|nt|passell: I like 1nt |pg||
nt|passell: more likely dbl rdbl by Weinstein|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh forgot about RDBL|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Mike -- is determining factor between P and 1N the @DJ?|pg||
nt|3for3: With 4333 it always pays to think about nt|pg||
nt|kit: Stansby will pick  4@S with 2 doubletons|pg||
nt|passell: freezing the puck doesnt always work out|pg||
nt|gowdy: na  take the fin|pg||
nt|robinswr: he could bid rck and hope that the opponents have the ace fo diamonds|pg||
nt|passell: am guessing 4diamonds would be blwd for clubs for them|pg||
nt|robinswr: easy to get to 6 how do you get to 7?|pg||
nt|passell: or even get to hearts   he will hook the spade for sure|pg||
nt|robinswr: you can make 7 spades just take the finesse|pg||
nt|gowdy: 5 @D    then 6 @h after  6 @C|pg||
nt|passell: youve always been smart for your age Steve|pg||
mb|4N|nt|passell: yes for me the J of diamonds is a huge card|pg||
nt|chorush: some pairs play that P here is penalties and have to bid if not|pg||
nt|passell: Hate 1nt  it slows down the opponents |pg||
nt|ahollan1: how close was Greco to bidding over 1@S?|pg||
mb|p|nt|me argent: @D bottom of his range so gets too high|pg||
nt|me argent: stevie i may need alot of support but not with double|pg||
nt|chorush: i am lukewarm towards them:)|pg||
nt|me argent: essential in some big @C systems but outside of that they are poo poo|pg||
nt|robinswr: the reason why  you play support doubles is that you define how many trumps you have which is important in deciding how high to compete |pg||
nt|chorush: the winning line seems to be to duck the spade since the club suit is frozen, but declarer doesnt know that|pg||
nt|me argent: they turned a plus into a minus here|pg||
nt|robinswr: when they make a takeout double over 1diamond it makes more sense to show support rather than show your four spades|pg||
nt|robinswr: you make a support double with the 234 or the AKQ|pg||
nt|chorush: even ducking won't help|pg||
nt|me argent: with weak hands you dont want the opponents knowing your trump length and with strong hands you should be able to muddle through without yhem|pg||
nt|me argent: like i said poo poo|pg||
nt|robinswr: poo poo back|pg||
nt|chorush: ok children, calm down|pg||
nt|robinswr: when in doubt bid rkc|pg||
mb|5D|an|1|nt|me argent: north has an uncomfortable lead|pg||
nt|kit: Trump lead safest here, and probably best -- he holds all the high cards|pg||
nt|me argent: indeed|pg||
nt|3for3: Of course low is safer and better than the ace..|pg||
nt|robinswr: no other bid makes sense|pg||
nt|passell: now 7heARTS?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfd: for about 2 seconds|pg||
nt|robinswr: i overcall at the one-level if i have a five-card suit and 8 points. the suit must be at least 65432|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but no worse|pg||
nt|algraves: when the clubs go bad he is going to need the Ace of diamonds onside|pg||
nt|kit: This is helpful for declarer -- now there is some chance.  On trump lead and heart back, he had no chnce|pg||
nt|3for3: he still will need to guess the @D's.|pg||
mb|7S|nt|passell: he knows partner is bidding on shape from the auction|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i wonder what the record is for most RDBL in single auction|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Levin has the green card half way to the tray then puts it back...thinking|pg||
nt|mcarroll: !|pg||
mb|p|nt|chorush: I had one against cohen-berkowitz with 5|pg||
nt|ahollan1: oh my|pg||
nt|passell: I would through away the rdbl card if I got the chance|pg||
nt|chorush: final contract was 3NT undoubled down 1|pg||
nt|ritong: good start|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves: perhaps they have their own opinion of what they overcall|pg||
nt|me argent: in OR kamil opened 1nt showing 15 17 pts and partner passed|pg||
nt|kit: I must say I am baffled about the opening lead.  Everything (enemy bidding, his holding all the high cards), seems to indicate a trump lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: grand slam try|pg||
nt|robinswr: now he'll try to make it|pg||
nt|robinswr: hope he guesses trumps better than hampson|pg||
nt|passell: he will|pg||
nt|passell: trump lead|pg||
pc|sT|nt|passell: maybe platnick is giving his partner a chance to bid with 6dia and 3 hearts|pg||
nt|passell: in case partner was 1363|pg||
nt|chorush: I would think 2S here by Levin|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: you certainly guessed the think part right|pg||
nt|ritong: @d jack now and discussion is on|pg||
nt|me argent: indeed|pg||
nt|robinswr: bet he guesses trumps|pg||
mc|13|nt|algraves: ok|pg||
nt|lml: this hand will not be easy|pg||
nt|algraves: no lots to do|pg||
nt|lml: Fleisher's biggest problem is to sort out the spade suit|pg||
nt|algraves: seems natural to just go down |pg||
nt|lml: probably|pg||
nt|warrens:  perfect.  nice call Mike|pg||
nt|po-s: not best...|pg||

nt|niclecuyer: yep|pg||
nt|poohbear: Levin will need to play partner for the @h 9  after declarer runs @cs|pg||

nt|chorush: yes it was|pg||
nt|robinswr: easy game|pg||
nt|passell: mostly created by not bidding more diamonds  |pg||
mb|p|nt|me argent: 1 or 2 @Ss?|pg||
nt|passell: sometimes playing close to the vest backfires|pg||
nt|robinswr: 3diamonds was insufficient|pg||
nt|passell: very much so|pg||
mb|1C|nt|ahollan1: i got one defense right -- will stick to bidding now|pg||
mb|d|nt|chorush: :)|pg||
nt|passell: not leading the K of diamonds off the dummy was his demise|pg||
nt|algraves: majors obviously|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Stansby not downgrading the hand - 1@C opened because playing weak nt|pg||
nt|robinswr: 12-14|pg||
mb|1D|nt|robinswr: since stansby plays 12-13 he opens 1club with 15|pg||
nt|algraves: they play weak NT so Lew preparing to rebid 1NT only Hampson beat him to it|pg||
nt|me argent: pass?  thats a suprise|pg||
nt|me argent: indeed that should keep the loss down if levin scores up 3nt in OR|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: i think we covered THAT :)|pg||
mb|1N|nt|ahollan1: 2@C = @H & @S|pg||
nt|3for3: South was able to show a GOOD 2@H bid in other room.  Here, the opening will drive NS into game|pg||

nt|robinswr: however he was fighting for 110 in the other room they're fighting for 400|pg||
mb|p|nt|me argent: good contract that should be down on @S lead|pg||
nt|robinswr: wonder what stansby is looking for with his 2diamond checkback bid|pg||
nt|passell: got to 6|pg||
mb|3C|nt|robinswr: like cappelletti|pg||
nt|kit: 3NT gets killed on spade lead, but that is unlikely|pg||
nt|3for3: I play a similar style and have had very good results with it.|pg||
nt|passell: maybe looking for a dia slam|pg||
mb|p|nt|chorush: Speaking of bidding, I really think intermediate jump overcalls are great when vulnerable. I Weinstein were using them he had one|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: 3@C was inv+ spades|pg||
nt|me argent: now it should make|pg||
nt|kjadams: 2S in Open lost battle but won war.     Would you bid with South after 2S P P ?|pg||
nt|me argent: that is if declarer draws trumps and claims:)|pg||
nt|me argent: 100%|pg||
nt|me argent: NS need to make this to hold thir losses to single digits|pg||
nt|kit: I would have led a diamond with the East hand, hoping for Jxxxx in partner's hand|pg||
nt|me argent: grco in OR has run to the safetyof 2nt doubled|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Gitelman: Low card lead means you don't like other suits?..Stansby: It's combination|pg||
nt|3for3: Both halves play NT on same board, not usually a good idea (especially if it is not 1NT)|pg||
nt|chorush: good stop by Martel and Stansby. Cards are not friendly for a spade contract at anything more than 2|pg||
nt|passell: slam would be great if partner has an ace instead of either king|pg||
mb|3D|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: meckwell use the but only when vul vs not|pg||
nt|ahollan1: show shape as if RHO opened   just don't need points since PARTNER bid first|pg||

nt|me argent: not an easy stop|pg||
mb|3N|nt|algraves: so your routine 18 pt game|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfd: Weinstein says:  this is a catch-up hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: clock shows 56 minutes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Mike Lawrence's Overcalls [at least in 1st edition]  had 3 treatments for jump overcalls depending upon vul|pg||
nt|passell: partner has the worst neither ace and 2 small diamonds|pg||
nt|passell: would you open c clubs on the last 1 Steve?|pg||
nt|passell: 2clubs|pg||
mb|4C|nt|algraves: but he will have to play it well|pg||
nt|kjadams: Seems all the Kibs would bid with South hand after 2S P P.   Fleisher did not bid.   No clue what is right!|pg||
nt|me argent: east wasnt looking for a @S ruff with his @C holding what he didnt know was he needed a @S trick as many spectators have pointed out he could have couvered all possabilities by ...|pg||
nt|me argent: leading @HK|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: of course -- thanks for qualifying that Steve|pg||
nt|robinswr: probably would open 2clubs|pg||
nt|passell: yes  weinstein did very well to get to slam after not Levin made a good bid|pg||
mb|4H|nt|algraves: Kamil couldnt read the singleton|pg||
nt|algraves: so 2@H make 2 in the fullness of time|pg||
nt|robinswr: i like leading 3rd best from AKQ. when my queen holds i can play suit preferance with the ace or king|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: EW Reg Smith|pg||
nt|passell: over 1spade 2 dia overcall and a raise he freely bid 3 spades on 2 small over his partners dbl|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|chorush: no Meckwell would likely be in 4S with this one|pg||
nt|me argent: would be almost impossible not playing weak NT except for al roth full stop|pg||
nt|passell: Hampson is getting excited here|pg||
mb|p|mb|5C|nt|me argent: even making 3nt wont prevent a double digit loss for @D team|pg||
nt|kit: This looks like a good result for N-S as 4@H might not make, but with E-W playing 2@S doubledin other room, it might not be so good.|pg||
nt|3for3: 2NT doubled|pg||
nt|kit: sorry, 2NT doubled|pg||
nt|robinswr: i wonder if they can make 4hearts doubled?|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: New edition came out this year but I haven't read it :(|pg||
nt|passell: good to steal this one  Playing such a limited system another dbl might have been called for  since he really didnt show extras the 1st time  just shape|pg||
nt|3for3: looks like 5 down|pg||
mb|p|nt|Vugraphzfd: table taking a short break|pg||
nt|chorush: In fact an intermediate jump overcall would work badly here as the opponents can make 3 diamonds and Diamond would double back in|pg||
nt|passell: can make a lot of diamonds|pg||
nt|chorush: short = smoking. the plaing area is on the fifth floor of the hotel so they have to go down and then outside|pg||
nt|kjadams: Heart King cuts communication for the spade winner.|pg||
mb|p|nt|passell: might beat this with a dia lead|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfd: everyone back|pg||
nt|ahollan1: on board 22   Moss in West took Mike's approach and bid 1N -- now in 3N|pg||
nt|ahollan1: wrong -- Moss bid 2@C [garbage stayman]|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Bobby: Certainly understand your problem|pg||
nt|passell: low spade lead the only chance  very dbl dummy|pg||
mb|1H|nt|me argent: declarer doesnt know its a singelton so might well go wrong|pg||
mb|d|mb|p|nt|algraves: well done by NS |pg||
nt|robinswr: when you're playing a forcing club you can open lighter|pg||
nt|algraves: NS make 3 @D|pg||
nt|kit: not 8 boards to go|pg||
mb|3D|nt|robinswr: he who opens the bidding has an advantage (like the serve in tennis)|pg||
nt|algraves: that would show both minors I  assume|pg||
nt|me argent: good OR result for fleisher|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves: EW 3@S|pg||
nt|robinswr: maybe 2spades shows two spades :)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: ba da bump|pg||
nt|algraves: that is the advanced version|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Too practical|pg||
nt|algraves: since 1@D precision could be 2@D and more clubs, they  have a lot of comp bids that show both minors so opener can choose|pg||
mb|3S|nt|passell: great spot needs only 3-2 spades|pg||
nt|barnets: South won the points on the last board by balancing with s X after his weak 2 opener- an unusual bid|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: sry now 7|pg||
nt|kit: Passing on South hand with 5-card spade suit would not be a popular choice, but it may well be right|pg||
nt|chorush: Fleisher beginning to extend lead; Levin made 3NT on board 97|pg||
nt|ritong: gitelmoss have personal ideas about fourth suit, also after pass|pg||
nt|robinswr: 3diamonds seems like an overbid|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 3@C=Puppet Stayman|pg||
mb|4D|nt|me argent: think platnik could have made a try|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 3@D promises at least 1 4M   3@H=4@S|pg||
nt|robinswr: when you are playing a forcing club you're forced to open 1 grunt (diamond) on balanced hands|pg||
nt|kit: after all, 7 tricks are 1 less than 8|pg||
nt|ritong: so i guess we have a demonstration here|pg||
nt|passell: can make 4dia or 2 spades here|pg||
mb|4S|nt|passell: found the killing heart lead|pg||
nt|ritong: 2@d basically a puppet to 2@h|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ahollan1: 4@H retransfer|pg||
nt|algraves: so again here EW get a spade contract stolen by light actions|pg||
nt|me argent: 6@Cs can make but the question is can it be bid?|pg||
nt|chorush: it seems to require a spade or trump lead to beat 6 hearts but I dont see either of them happening|pg||
nt|chorush: and 6 clubs will make|pg||
mb|p|nt|me argent: im a 2@S bidder myself|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: guessing   Levin PASS says no @H stop|pg||
nt|robinswr: this is a 9-9 (both sides have 9-card fits) hand so ew violated the law|pg||
nt|me argent: not sure if 6@Hs is cold|pg||
nt|robinswr: whats wrong with a 1spade overcall|pg||
nt|passell: moss gittleman bid to 4nt down on last 1 |pg||
pc|h7|pc|hQ|nt|me argent: but i am sure the experts can tell me|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|robinswr: by opening that trash hamson stole the hand|pg||
nt|algraves: You are just not used to having 19 pts on this auction ,opening bid and limit raise in minor|pg||
nt|ahollan1: levin-weinstein pushed to 4@D|pg||
nt|algraves: so each of NS thought the other was lighter and pulled in  a bit because of vulenrability|pg||
pc|s6|nt|chorush: yes, he is saying the contract is better played by Weinstein|pg||
nt|passell: shows a hand he has nothing in hearts he wants lead up to|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and Weinstein had choice of bidding 4@S or RDBL to retransfer again|pg||
pc|sA|nt|passell: he might do it with AX in hearts in case partner had the queen|pg||
nt|ahollan1: but Mike wouldn't have one of those options -- having discarded his Blue card|pg||
nt|passell: true|pg||
nt|chorush: For those of you who are not familiar with it, 3C asked for 5 card minor; 3D said no 5 card minor, 3H promised 4 spades, then Levin cue bid 4C|pg||
nt|chorush: major not minor|pg||
nt|passell: I dont mind having it  just hate my opponents to have it|pg||
pc|s4|nt|robinswr: i don't understand why they don't play 4spades here as rkc|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|chorush: it is not in the bag yet|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Moss still thinking|pg||
nt|ritong: i think the @s ace is right sided, somehow|pg||
nt|me argent: playing low from dummy would be a good start|pg||
nt|ritong: east shifting to a trump does not put it in jeopardy|pg||
nt|robinswr: not sure but he has to use his entries wisely and not try for a spade lead|pg||
nt|barnets: If he plays a spade at trick two and they return a spade he can go down|pg||
nt|chorush: he cant simply ruff a diamond come to his hand and ruff another diamond; that will leave him sort of locked in dummy. So he might lead a spade at trick 2. if he does he might go ...|pg||
nt|chorush: set|pg||
nt|ritong: well, for starters @s A with west simplifies the thing|pg||
nt|barnets: best is @DA Druff @SK |pg||
nt|robinswr: ruff a diamond lead a spade ruff a spade ruff a diamond trump club to ace|pg||
pc|sK|nt|me argent: yeah moss will make it|pg||
nt|ritong: yup  ravissante|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Giteman: I've good stuff here|pg||

pc|s3|pg||
pc|d8|nt|algraves: now he is home, well done|pg||
pc|d2|pc|dK|nt|algraves: These aggressive limited openings can be effective when they find an early fit|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: the only thing that hand had going for it was the vulnerability|pg||
nt|kit: Keep in mind that for spades to be superior to NT at IMPs, spades has to take 2 more tricks than NT|pg||
nt|3for3: I always transfer with 5, myself|pg||
nt|me argent: i dont|pg||
nt|kit: I think one should use judgment|pg||
nt|me argent: down like a dog|pg||
nt|barnets: now spade return he is down|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|chorush: I think I would have done that also|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ahollan1: one twist Ira -- their 3@D promises 4@H and/or 4@S  some  pairs [meckwell] say it just denies 5@H/@S|pg||
pc|dA|nt|algraves: North is peering through the looking glass but no Alice|pg||
nt|algraves: the Chesire cat sits west|pg||
nt|3for3: It does enable you to back into your major with 4441 hands, and partner knows you don't have 5 of em|pg||
nt|me argent: im a 2 way stayman man myself transfers over 1nt too complicated|pg||
nt|3for3: Then your doubles always deliver 2 of their suit|pg||

mb|2C|mb|d|an|alerted|mb|2S|nt|ahollan1: makes up for systemic loses from their nebulous @D opener prevening effective competition|pg||

nt|robinswr: this is a bidders game|pg||
nt|robinswr: actually there was a free lunch between the 2nd and 3rd quarter|pg||
nt|algraves: well you have so many more bids in your box than passes you pretty much have to start bidding eventually|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @S raise guarantees 4  [support dbl situation]|pg||
nt|robinswr: double of 2clubs must just be a weak hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: something of a difference in evaluation|pg||
nt|me argent: another slam|pg||
nt|kjadams: agree.   Not that the 2D bid created worries where the other table was silent.|pg||
nt|kjadams: Not = Note  :-)|pg||
nt|me argent: true norths 1nt opening showed 13 15 points in this room and 15 17 points in other room but still south could have tried|pg||
nt|me argent: of course transfers must be played over 2NT and many analgous situations|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: i was told that Bd 95 will be replayed..earlier bd fouled|pg||
nt|robinswr: good hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves: in the other room south passed 2@S|pg||
nt|robinswr: since their 1diamond is limited they can make preemptive bids here|pg||
nt|ahollan1: have you ever run out of pass cards Allan?|pg||
nt|algraves: I am not sure Martel would bid normally with that hand., but he is probably getting a little tired of being pushed around|pg||

pc|s4|pc|sQ|pc|s6|pg||

nt|algraves: not sure I mean|pg||
nt|robinswr: i agree about the 2heart bid|pg||
nt|kit: Martel can now bid 4@C to set trumps, and then we will see what happens|pg||
nt|robinswr: if double shows a good hand, why did stansby pass 2spades|pg||
nt|passell: more freezing the puck|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ahollan1: Moss also bid 2@H  but playing standard Weinstein could only bid 2@S and there it ended|pg||
nt|algraves: well they have all their assets working for them. and the suits break|pg||
nt|algraves: somehow EW have to get a force going on dummy in clubs|pg||
nt|henryb:  this is an effective lead as it establishes the @d trick before declarer can take a pitch|pg||
nt|robinswr: they have four top losers |pg||
nt|kjadams: possible Beer hand  (Diamond 7 takes last trick in 6H)|pg||
pc|c3|nt|algraves: no spade fit|pg||

pc|c4|nt|ahollan1: 2@H=transfer  |pg||

nt|me argent: so far the different nt ranges have lead to @D team losing 18 imps on 2 bds this session|pg||

nt|ahollan1: thx JoAnna -- that is better than my just saying 2@H was trf|pg||
nt|dburn: still, I guess there wasn't much of a difference after all - you pass 2@s and you go down one, or you bid 3NT and you go down one|pg||
nt|kit: 5@C 2 with queen|pg||
pc|c2|nt|algraves: well 2@S went one down|pg||

nt|me argent: very suprising result from OR|pg||

pc|s9|nt|me argent: good biddings|pg||
nt|me argent: only thing left to do is win 13 tricks|pg||
nt|kit: And with things splitting should make -- 2 ruffs in dummy get him to 7 trump tricks, 3 diamonds, 2 hearts, 1 spade = 13|pg||
nt|me argent: on a @S lead?|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Moss considering S lead|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|algraves: yes back to having tto force the dummy|pg||

nt|algraves: if they are they let me make an unmakeable game|pg||
nt|robinswr: he can lead the ace of diamonds and see if diamonds split|pg||
nt|robinswr: prabably can't make if diamonds are 4-1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: as Steve said -- Stansby knew Martel had @CK -- wonder why not immediate low from @CAce|pg||
nt|algraves: yes that is a good idea|pg||
nt|ahollan1: sorry Allan - i missed your covering that :(|pg||

nt|robinswr: good 6spades looking at the ew cards|pg||
nt|me argent: maybe he was afraid of overstating his high card values kit|pg||
nt|ritong: but 1) they do not grow on trees|pg||
nt|me argent: playing strong nt one can open 1 @C and rebid 1nt over 1@S|pg||
nt|ritong: and2) you also have not to lose onside of that|pg||
nt|robinswr: and jon weinstein's team did very well getting all the way to the semi-finals|pg||
nt|passell: extremely  they played the most hands of anyone|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: so, i have to agree, this kind of lead is hard to overcome|pg||
mb|1C|nt|chorush: Good 4 spade contract here for EW. |pg||
nt|ahollan1: i was going to say  over 1@S will be interesting if Diamond tries a Negative Free Bid 2@H  [if available in their partnership]|pg||
nt|ritong: 19 boards left, however|pg||
nt|robinswr: just have to play one deal at a time|pg||
nt|me argent: 3@Ds or 2@Hs?|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves: in the other room they bid 7 when east bid 5NT over the Q ask |pg||
nt|dburn: ...maybe Kamil could have done what they did at the other table, whcih was to bid 5NT over the ask for the queen of spades|pg||
nt|algraves: and they then bid onemore|pg||
nt|kit: I think he was more afraid of missing 3NT when it was only game|pg||
nt|chorush: this has been like a heavyweight boxing match; a lot of punches landed and fun to watch. Not over by a long shot|pg||
nt|me argent: we know fred will bid 5@Ds|pg||
nt|ritong: so the huddler is east|pg||
mb|1S|nt|algraves: 2NT a limit raise in spades type hand|pg||
nt|dburn: still and all, at the other table they bid only three spades - at this one, East bid four|pg||
mb|p|nt|ahollan1: does west look too strong for 2@S to anyone else?|pg||
nt|passell: when he wins dia gets uppercut|pg||
nt|algraves: Yes that is a good point , perhaps west passed to quickly|pg||
nt|me argent: the Great Shuffler has decided to give these boys another chance|pg||
nt|kit: Drury here I think|pg||
mb|1N|an|Alerted|nt|algraves: 4@H makes|pg||
nt|algraves: 4@S down one with best defense|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed it does, but at the moment the other side is trying for game|pg||
nt|robinswr: stansby decided to treat his hand as a strong notrump|pg||
nt|algraves: yes lots of handling with the bad breaks|pg||
nt|ahollan1: as you see 2@S can include what many call a strong NT opener|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: I'm not convinced he treated it as a strong NT as much as he doesn't have any rebid problems|pg||
nt|robinswr: they play strong notrump vul in 3rd seat only|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: agreed, but there is no guarantee that rebidding 1@s is 15-17 right?|pg||
nt|algraves: really there is no way to make 6@S|pg||
nt|robinswr: unless he gets a club lead he'll go down in 6spades|pg||
nt|algraves: maybe double dummy |pg||
nt|algraves: not even double dummy|pg||
nt|robinswr: he has to lose a heart and can't set up the clubs without drawing trumps|pg||
nt|me argent: sure east will just blast slam in the face of lews 4@Ds|pg||
nt|robinswr: 6spades by west is cold|pg||
nt|me argent: ????|pg||
nt|ritong: acting again is not clearcut|pg||
mb|p|nt|me argent: X? whatever that means?|pg||
nt|me argent: by south|pg||
nt|me argent: or 3@Cs|pg||
nt|me argent: but that might be GF|pg||
nt|tsadek: may be pass Forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: 2spades showed values for a strong notrump|pg||
nt|kit: Stansby can just about bid the slam himself if he knows his partner has good spades -- will be at worst on heart finesse from his point of view|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  or 2N?|pg||
nt|me argent: how does south express his hand?|pg||
nt|chorush: no questoin pass was forcing|pg||
pc|h5|nt|robinswr: they probably can raise on 3 so 2nt asks if he has four spades |pg||
nt|robinswr: 4clubs shows four spades|pg||
pc|hK|nt|kjadams: A lot of spots this hand.   with good guessing, can take a lot of tricks|pg||
nt|me argent: looks like this is noy a discussed auction by NS|pg||
nt|3for3: there was a big if in there, especially since he doesn't know his partner has FOUR spades.|pg||
nt|3for3: Two way drury might have helped with that, of course|pg||
nt|kit: right -- would have been good hand for 2-way Drury, where 2@D shows 4|pg||
nt|me argent: exactly danny|pg||
nt|3for3: I recall Hampson doesn't like 2way either...|pg||
nt|me argent: no hand is good for 2 way drury kit|pg||
nt|kit: It is going to be difficult for Martel to get excited about his junky collection, so Stansby will have to do a lot himself|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: 3H explained Natural/slam try|pg||
nt|me argent: its a poopy convention|pg||
nt|chorush: most probably this is their way of inviting 7|pg||
nt|robinswr: 7dia - 800|pg||
nt|me argent: guess chip felt he was too good for an immediate jump to 6@Ss|pg||
nt|chorush: Fred reviewing the scoring table|pg||
nt|robinswr: but gitleman is worried about 7spades|pg||
nt|me argent: seeing all the hand aint that easy all the time|pg||
nt|chorush: luckily for their side, Moss would be on led against 7S and he would have a good idea of what to lead|pg||
pc|h2|nt|me argent: KOSCH where are you?|pg||
nt|me argent: KOACH|pg||
nt|robinswr: so martel and stansby get the best possible result|pg||
nt|chorush: I am not a big ace leader but I would lead this one|pg||
nt|robinswr: seems clear to lead your ace|pg||
nt|me argent: im wit you again ira sorry:(|pg||
nt|robinswr: 4diamonds shows majors|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Chip on bathroom break|pg||
pc|h7|pg||
nt|ahollan1: and maybe balance hand?|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c4|nt|dburn: they made this at the other table?|pg||
nt|algraves: well west judged to lead the Ace of @C|pg||
nt|robinswr: 0-3 keycards|pg||
nt|algraves: it would be surprising if this wasnt a push, down 1 at both tables|pg||
nt|robinswr: if you're unclear whether it's 0 or 3 bid 5spades. partner passes with 0 bids with 3 |pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c3|pg||
nt|kit: I think Martel should bid 4@H here -- the king of hearts may be what Stansby needs (as it is)|pg||
nt|3for3: Why, Joey?|pg||
pc|c7|pc|c9|nt|algraves: yes sounds like zero key cards to me|pg||
nt|algraves: well he will like dummy for awhile|pg||
nt|robinswr: this is not the lead clubs against slam deal|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: wouldn't that give him the worlds worse 11 count?|pg||
nt|me argent: it tells the opponents too much|pg||
pc|cT|nt|passell: good start|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|passell: equal vulnerability it seems like a good bid|pg||
nt|passell: normal weak 2 bid  hands fit well|pg||
nt|kjadams: seems normal to guess diamonds wrong to keep west off lead|pg||
pc|h4|nt|algraves: but gradually he will become disgruntled|pg||
pc|h8|pc|h9|pc|c5|pg||
nt|chorush: I think he was a bit better than Weinstein might have expected but it is the interior cards of his hand that make 4 spades worthwhile. That spade 10 and club 109 are vital|pg||
nt|3for3: If Martel had appreciated and shown his @H King, things would be different|pg||
pc|h3|pc|s2|nt|algraves: at the Bridge Gods|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 6@S -100 is much better score than 6@C -100|pg||
nt|me argent: and is not necessary|pg||
pc|h6|nt|robinswr: here its obvious that he has 3 there are some hands where its not obvious|pg||
nt|algraves: and then realize it is surely a push|pg||
nt|kit: yes -- he does have good trumps, so 4@H not overdoing things|pg||
pc|d5|pc|hA|nt|ritong: NS found the par next room|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|ritong: so this should be 12 more imps|pg||
pc|hT|nt|robinswr: you hope its a push. sometimes opponents miss good slams  that go down|pg||
nt|algraves: the rats|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d2|nt|kjadams: Nice Play.|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfd: yes he really did win trick one with the ace of clubs|pg||
nt|kjadams: note that he had to play 2 hearts before doing that so that declarer did not have transportation.  JD could have made by hooking club while he still had diamond exit.|pg||

nt|passell: all on the club guess now|pg||
nt|robinswr: he could play hearts first|pg||

nt|robinswr: no harm in playing hearts first|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|passell: wow that is a lot to bid|pg||
nt|chorush: yes, and he will duly go set at least one|pg||
nt|passell: Levin did well not to lead the K of clubs it would have given away the club suit and the whole hand|pg||
nt|ahollan1: @HK useless  so  2N probably gets more credit than 4@S|pg||
nt|ahollan1: same contract in other room -- very different auctions|pg||
nt|kjadams: 4 aces and 3rd seat = upgrade to 2N opener|pg||
nt|kit: After running 4 diamonds, Gitelman will have to find club shift|pg||
nt|me argent: seems to me if lew disliked his hand so much it might have been better to for go drury on his junkpile and raise partner directly to 2@Ss|pg||
nt|3for3: On 87, Grampson will open a big @C, and responder has a +, so slam is very likely there|pg||
nt|kit: One key should be the order of Moss's diamond plays.  If Moss wanted a heart shift, he should play ace of diamonds before king|pg||
nt|me argent: slam was certainly reachable from their|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Moss thinking to shift C3 or Q|pg||
pc|c6|nt|algraves: this is friendly for NS|pg||
pc|cK|nt|kit: This solves the problem nicely|pg||
nt|robinswr: i don't recommend under leading aces at trick one against suit contracts|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|chorush: yes, after the king of club lead declared might wellguess both the diamond and spades|pg||
nt|ahollan1: makes up for last hand being friendly for NS   [sarcasm]|pg||
nt|robinswr: he's going to be happy at the location of the trumps|pg||
nt|algraves: yes and the diamond offside so no slam|pg||
pc|h6|nt|passell: a game try seems to be in order|pg||
nt|algraves: smooth duck by Fleisher , Hampson has good feel in those situations|pg||
nt|algraves: kamil is thinking he could tap dummy and guaranette trump tricks|pg||
nt|algraves: trick|pg||
nt|algraves: regardless he has no losing option now after the spade misguess|pg||
pc|h3|nt|ahollan1: doesn't @CK mean down 2?|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h7|pg||
nt|chorush: although this defense is gong to pinpoint the KQ of clubs in Levins hand, the practical effect might be to enable declarer to go set 1|pg||
nt|ahollan1: in college days, that [down 1] was definition of good bridge  |pg||
nt|passell: yes winning the club K might have worked  |pg||
nt|chorush: Levin is likely to play the spade J if trumps are led from south|pg||
nt|passell: it would have shown up later anyway though|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Levin leans back in his chair to consider the position here|pg||
nt|passell: a diamond now and a club back would lead to an interesting end position|pg||
nt|ahollan1: does anybody know if Weinstein ever opens 3rd seat 1@H with only 4? |pg||
nt|passell: if Steve had the KJ of dia instead of the ace and declare had 4 clubs it would be neccessary|pg||
nt|ahollan1: probably unlikely with Platnick 4@S call regardless|pg||
nt|passell: down 1 very likely result from here|pg||
nt|chorush: Im certain he does although more and more people are using a jump to 3 here as mixed instead of preemptive. Don't know if Levin and Weinstein are part of that group|pg||

pc|cA|nt|warrens:  If East pitches the club Q, he should be down|pg||

nt|me argent: except of course on 3rd @S|pg||

nt|me argent: but no harm no foul|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|passell: he will have a chance to shift unless declarer sneaks in a spade|pg||
nt|passell: will be impossible though|pg||
nt|robinswr: smolen|pg||
nt|robinswr: 3hearts shows five spades and four hearts|pg||
nt|robinswr: allows opener to play the hand|pg||
nt|robinswr: you don't play garbage stayman over 2nt|pg||
nt|algraves: 4,5 honour count and huge suit. almost 2@C then 2nt|pg||
nt|kit: Some danger of getting too high here|pg||
nt|robinswr: martel trusted gitelman|pg||
pc|dT|nt|robinswr: he probably would have doubled 5diamonds if gitelman had just raised 4d to 4|pg||
pc|d3|nt|algraves: but you can only upgrade so much|pg||
nt|robinswr: pick a slam|pg||
nt|ahollan1: is 4@C now any 54(40)?   [where 4@D needed to show 4@S 6@H]|pg||
nt|robinswr: he'll bid 6diamonds|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d2|pg||
nt|robinswr: i don't think stansby will pass this|pg||
nt|algraves: Stansby will pull this I bet|pg||
nt|kit: 3NT jump shows extras, but Stansby has his minimum|pg||
nt|me argent: suprised lew didnt bid 3@Ds over 2@DS|pg||
nt|kit: 2@S I'm not sure of -- some kind of artificial call|pg||
nt|kit: I think 3@D would show 4|pg||
nt|kit: they have some artificial methods here, but I don't know them all|pg||
nt|robinswr: for instance 1spade showing clubs allows you to bid clubs with KQJxx and out or a game force with clubs|pg||
nt|passell: martel perhaps could have done more here|pg||
mc|12|nt|me argent: i would almost never have 4@Ds on this auction|pg||
nt|chorush: this could wind up being a gain for Diamond if opps get to a slam or a loss if 5D X or XX. I confess I would just have kicked it in|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: last bd coming up..thanks to all|pg||

nt|me argent: LAST|pg||
nt|kit: and yet another slam hand|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Last before lunch break..scheduled to be back in an hour|pg||
nt|me argent: the GREAT SHUFFLER has deciced to spread the wealth|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfd: Bd95 will be replayed after this last bd of the segment|pg||
nt|robinswr: congrats to the Fleisher team who played very well and the diamond team who played well but just not well enough|pg||
mb|1S|nt|passell: congratulations again to the Fleisher team  a truly great performance beating the 2 terrifric teams to win convincingly|pg||
mb|2H|nt|passell: another good action quarter|pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: martel gets the first bid in always good against these thieves|pg||
nt|ahollan1: last board for the day    4 15-board sets tomorrow to determine USA1 for 2011 Bermuda Bowl|pg||
mb|2N|nt|chorush: if S passes 2NT - P - 4H - Dbl|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 3rd of 8  15-board segments scheduled to begin in about 1 hour 15 minues|pg||
nt|ahollan1: USA2 determined by 2011 Trials|pg||
nt|me argent: EW finally gets a turn with the bidding boxes|pg||
nt|robinswr: they also beat a flight B team in the round of 8|pg||
mb|3C|nt|chorush: Levin may pass a double with Ax|pg||
nt|passell: yes then he might try to cash diamonds for pitches in clubs and have the 3rd 1 ruffed|pg||
nt|algraves: Hampson is enjoying this|pg||
nt|robinswr: 10:00 cst |pg||
nt|kit: When South bids and rebid clubs, North can take over with RKC and bid the grand I think|pg||
mb|3N|mb|4C|nt|robinswr: see what preempts get you|pg||
nt|me argent: 5@Cs great spot|pg||
nt|chorush: Roland shield your eyes|pg||
nt|ritong: he did|pg||
nt|me argent: lovely little EW contract|pg||
mb|p|nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|chorush: so its not true that particpants who use the F word are barred?|pg||
mb|p|nt|algraves: so this is 17-18|pg||
nt|ahollan1: final set of the day [but 60 boards tomorrow] sheduled to begin in 20 min|pg||
nt|kit: North might temporarize with 3@H|pg||
nt|me argent: dont see why|pg||
nt|me argent: set trumps|pg||
nt|kit: 4@C certainly reasonable also, although oddly enough it may now be more difficult to get to the grand|pg||
nt|ritong: naturalists would bid at least 3@s|pg||
nt|robinswr: not sure what happened on 95|pg||
nt|robinswr: the flight b team was short handed|pg||
nt|passell: they had a great run|pg||
nt|passell: good night all glad to have been with you throughout|pg||
mb|p|nt|robinswr: easy to find diamond fit if no preempt|pg||
nt|ahollan1: other room bidding not over -- currently at 7@D|pg||
pc|hK|nt|robinswr: i enjoyed giving my opinions to this great bridge event |pg||
nt|passell: special thnx to our operators and bbo for giving us this great view of the matches|pg||
pc|h3|nt|Vugraphzfd: redouble explained as wants partner to play it|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ahollan1: Diamond finally got off the set 'schneid'|pg||
nt|passell: I am always happy when Bobby is dummy no matter who he is playing with|pg||
nt|chorush: I wonder how redbl differs from P. Maybe better hand?|pg||
nt|passell: rdbl shows ace|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i believe EW play   PASS when Texas doubled says "interest in competing"|pg||
nt|passell: great match between 2 great teams  the US will be well represented either way|pg||
nt|algraves: well they got pre emptedout of good 6 @D|pg||
nt|algraves: this will make 5|pg||
nt|me argent: 3nt also makes|pg||
nt|robinswr: i use flannery|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|passell: yes good 9 of diamonds|pg||
nt|robinswr: amazing how great bbo is giving us all this great bridge to watch|pg||
pc|dT|nt|kit: now this 5@C call is very poor -- his hand is much too strong for that|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|ahollan1: winner of this match will be USA1 in the 2011 Bermuda Bowl|pg||
nt|chorush: so do I. |pg||
pc|dK|nt|me argent: the curse of scotland assures the making of 3nt vs any def|pg||
nt|passell: makes it safe to play on hearts|pg||
nt|kit: everybody asks what I would suggest instead of 5@C.  My answer is:  Anything but 5@C|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|ritong: a last shock to greco|pg||
nt|ritong: pard had exactly what he needed to make 4@h|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|me argent: with 3 aces north might have done more also|pg||
pc|d6|nt|ahollan1: USA2 will be determined by the 2011 Trials|pg||
nt|passell: looks like he took the straight forward approach saved an undertrick|pg||
nt|ahollan1: 2010 world championship events in Philadelphia are NOT country-specific|pg||
nt|passell: need ax or stiff Q onside|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ahollan1: JoAnna -- thanks for the great work   and please thank the players for us|pg||
nt|algraves: thanks to Johanna |pg||
nt|ahollan1: 7@D it is|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ahollan1: right Allan -- the NT ranges all move up 1 point  3rd seat vul and 4th seat|pg||
nt|3for3: I guess he didn't want to cue his void in partner's suit.  Perhaps 5@C showed good trumps.|pg||
pc|c4|nt|kit: 5@C is his weakest bid -- anything else would show he had some extra strength.  Doesn't matter what he Q-bids, but he must Q-bid something|pg||
pc|h6|nt|me argent: safety 1st|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|me argent: 3@Cs did show a big hand|pg||
nt|ritong: as mike passell says, when it rains  it pours|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|nt|passell: why was that a safety play?|pg||
nt|ritong: brad s trick did not work|pg||
pc|c2|pc|c9|pg||
nt|algraves: oops Moss and Gitelman in 7@D|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c7|nt|me argent: didnt think much about the hand mike just figured if levin played the hand that way he must be right|pg||
pc|cK|pc|cQ|pg||
nt|robinswr: on previous hand|pg||
