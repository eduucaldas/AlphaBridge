nt|yuval10: http://www.svenskbridge.se/e107_plugins/forum/forum_viewtopic.php?26046.0 post_26060|pg||
nt|bagman: Sementa likely to pass this as S could not open|pg||
nt|santyclz: Not everyone passes the s hand even with the poor @S structure.|pg||
mb|d|nt|star6ija: 1N all pass|pg||
nt|haans: gadgets|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: did not feel for it|pg||
nt|yuval10: we're due for some interesting matches|pg||
mb|2N|mb|p|nt|yuval10: N in the OR also opened 1@h |pg||
mb|3D|nt|yannis3012: begining with a difficult 3nt to make|pg||
nt|star6ija: 17-18 direct 1 N, 19-20 via 1h|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: EW system is 4-card majors, light style 14-16 and 15-17NT. NS is Transfer Walsh 15-17NT|pg||
nt|athene: tricky hand to play - ruffing diamond finesse is a possibility|pg||
nt|bagman: There are lot's of high cards out and E passed and W opened weak|pg||
nt|athene: the problem is that ruffing diamond finesse might not be that useful, even if the king is with east|pg||
nt|athene: because if the @DQ is covered you have to use the @CA to get back there for a fast pitch of the heart|pg||
nt|athene: and that gives up on a double club finesse|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer wants a quick discards and wants to play the clubs for one loser|pg||
nt|athene: it's possible he might put all his eggs in one basket and take a normal diamond finesse; i.e. lead to the queen|pg||
nt|bagman: W  has shown up with @HKQ, does he have @DK and @CH?|pg||
nt|athene: the other issue is, you aren't necessarily going all-out to make|pg||
nt|athene: if it risks incurring two or three additional vulnerable undertricks|pg||
nt|bagman: S vulnerable he needs to make as many tricks as possible unless he has 9 safe|pg||
nt|bagman: He has likely 3 spade losers and a club|pg||
nt|athene: not at all an easy decision for south here|pg||
nt|athene: i prefer to open these hands 2@S first time|pg||
nt|athene: passing might appear safer but you often end up having to take more of a risk later at a higher level|pg||
nt|bagman: If he takes the straight diamond finesse, he needs to play @S to the Q|pg||
nt|athene: he knows the points are split fairly evenly between east and west|pg||
nt|bagman: Hoping for Jx KQxxx Kxx Qx or similar leaving E AKx xx xxx Kxx|pg||
nt|athene: west has weak-2 and east can't open - that doesn't leave much room for variation, with 21 hcp missing|pg||
nt|athene: the only problem is, there are a lot of variations in which cards each defender has|pg||
nt|bagman: If he places KQ of hearts and @DK west, he is quite restricted to place the rest for a make|pg||
nt|andreasw:  only lead is @S if u dont want to give any trick's|pg||
nt|haans: South do not liked it|pg||
mb|p|nt|lmeili: 4N shows 6 4?|pg||
nt|ziff:  Looks like the par contract|pg||
nt|yuval10: so no swing in a rather dangerous board |pg||
nt|yuval10: Israeli open for instance opened 1@c and played it wrong-sidedly, going down 1|pg||
nt|aldek: it can be made, but unlikely|pg||
nt|cameron_1: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: another thinnish game reached|pg||

nt|haans: a killer|pg||
pc|d5|nt|haans: i do not like prempts over prempts|pg||
nt|h_karluk: they missed 6@d by N|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d6|pg||
nt|andersk: a push now, 1 NT RD would been interesting|pg||
nt|andreasw:  solved|pg||
pc|s2|nt|jameslee 2: on the other room hand 1 the lead was a small @S in 4@H |pg||
pc|sK|nt|rigas_karo: kalimera se olous|pg||
nt|star6ija: J@h was better continuation|pg||
pc|s7|nt|ady: should get home here     club loser will disappear|pg||

nt|ady: might beat it now with a club switch|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|yannis3012: hi ntino|pg||
nt|ziff:  I imagine 4NT showed a desire to play that contract|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|bagman: If he places the @DK east, he has probably some better chances to make|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dQ|nt|yannis3012: evrything is in, so 3nt is cold|pg||
nt|eweber: it seems we didn't miss too much by starting a bit late here|pg||
nt|aldek: however south did not enter the bidding over 1@D with some cards in the majors,|pg||
pc|d3|nt|haans: close to error|pg||
pc|d7|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: +1 now|pg||
nt|Walddk12: Operator, a couple of typos in North's name   Haraldsson|pg||
pc|cJ|pc|c3|nt|eweber: as I just see Russia is playing with Khiuppenen-Kholomeev in the closed room, NL with Wijs-Muller|pg||
pc|c6|nt|aldek: you could play for @CK in north|pg||
nt|mamos: David prederving that 1D2|pg||
nt|mamos: @d2|pg||
nt|cameron_1: thinking followed by going down most likely :(|pg||
nt|shevek: 3NT much better contract than 4@s|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes but with both hand's 4-3-3-3 both of thy would rather stand in 3nt|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|haans: say thank you Sweden|pg||

nt|shevek: 3@s = 6 cards, Max|pg||
nt|andreasw:  Hello Murat|pg||
nt|shevek: hi Murat|pg||
mb|3H|nt|mcarroll: So no problem then :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lmeili: not me|pg||
nt|roswolf: hearts will be the chosen trump suit i'm sure|pg||
nt|MolvaM: hi :)|pg||
nt|andreasw:   Haraldsson got scared?|pg||
nt|shevek: well stopped|pg||
nt|MolvaM: if 3@s shows max, then north must go 4@s no?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|h_karluk: pre vs pre + un vs un are useful toys|pg||
nt|ady: should not be if in a slam|pg||
nt|roswolf: maybe not -|pg||
nt|bagman: Now S must do something|pg||
nt|athene: it might be hard for NS to diagnose they hold a diamond stopper betwen them|pg||
mb|p|nt|eweber: and the result of round 2 is not yet online|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 1@D has multiple meanings, could be negative|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 1NT is a strong NT |pg||
nt|eweber: 18-20|pg||
nt|Gerben42: maybe 17 because white / red they play a mini NT|pg||
nt|roswolf: we will see now|pg||
nt|santyclz: 4@s e-w looks interesting.|pg||
nt|bagman: Looks like NS end in a club partial|pg||
nt|athene: many pairs would be able to bid with south's hand first time|pg||
nt|shevek: sry, I see now it shows 6@s and minimum|pg||
nt|aap00: 1@c = precision?|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: not a good position of the key cards seems will go a few down |pg||
nt|haans: needed the 7th hearts for 3@H bid|pg||
mb|4H|nt|star6ija: Bulgarians are in 3N in the open room|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: good for them as the heart finesse is off|pg||
nt|athene: for example playing transfers you could bid 1@S there to show values but deny a major|pg||
nt|athene: assuming your 1@C is not raise-able, as is the case for most people these days :(|pg||
nt|bagman: I wonder what 1NT would have shown by S |pg||
nt|star6ija: board 1|pg||
nt|mcarroll: A swing so as 3NT makes on 1|pg||
nt|shevek: with Max he'd bid 3 in a new suit|pg||
nt|MolvaM: makes sense then|pg||
nt|Walddk12: We'll have the name corrected soon. I asked our coordinator to go to the room|pg||
nt|Walddk12: Some operators don't look at their screen|pg||
nt|andreasw:  let's say Magnusson had show,n max would u bid 4@s or 3nt?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 4@s for me|pg||
nt|shevek:  Haraldsson : http://www.worldbridge.org/people/person.asp?qryid=3371|pg||
nt|MolvaM: running scores at....|pg||
nt|andreasw:  u dont really have ace's and king's and the minor suit's is not wery good in 4@s i think i would bid 3nt and let p decide|pg||
nt|MolvaM: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/runningscores/asp/roundteamsconditstatclassicmod.asp?qtournid=819&qshowflag=1|pg||
mb|p|nt|lmeili: if N bids 3@s after X, declerar might guess wrong of @d|pg||
nt|boyklas: double by west was take-out or establishes GF?|pg||
nt|motu: t/o|pg||
nt|lmeili: except guessing @d all other ways work|pg||
nt|haans: or costly ...|pg||
mb|p|nt|lmeili: @d AK then @h|pg||
nt|bagman: The diamond length often makes up for the missing stopper|pg||
nt|athene: south really likes his hand after his partner's free 2@C rebid|pg||
nt|bagman: Interesting 3@H|pg||
nt|bagman: cannot be natural|pg||
nt|athene: he is looking for 3nt - prepared to play 4@C if necessary|pg||
nt|haans: cue-bidding makes slam harder to make :)|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: the bid is on the limit ·3@H |pg||
nt|haans: but all will get higher|pg||
pc|c3|nt|roswolf: north does bid the slam how is south's luck today?|pg||
nt|ady: may get this right     west will show with singleton club|pg||
nt|davidb: W  overcall will make the guess in H tuff|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup agree david|pg||
nt|roswolf: i expect this to go down|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: seems  a 4@H -1 |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: with some chance for declarer he will take a good thinking |pg||
pc|cJ|nt|Walddk12: Name corrected|pg||
pc|cQ|pc|cA|pg||
nt|bagman: 5@C is a good bet|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Where are we going now? is 4@S Keycard?|pg||
nt|haans: nope cue no dim con|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Thanks|pg||
nt|mamos: this looks like a hand for topping up the caffeine|pg||
nt|shevek: Iceland lost their 1st match vs Italy (14-16) and then went on winning the next 10|pg||
nt|ftpe: bidding seems like strong club|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h7|nt|Gerben42: Netherlands had a bad start vs Ireland, whereas Russia started with a small win vs Sweden, a competitor for a Bermuda Bowl spot|pg||
nt|shevek: Wales is running 6th|pg||
nt|MolvaM: seems many norths could just blast 4@s after hearing pd open a weak 2 here|pg||
pc|h2|nt|haans: 5@H risky|pg||
nt|xenya: @SA followed by @SK and another spade would have defeated it -- previous hand |pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|lmeili: when @d QJ does'nt fall, still the chance @h 3-3 or Tx, and @c K on side|pg||
nt|bagman: It needs the heart finesse|pg||
nt|aap00: 1@c = strong, 1@s = looks like "bal GF", some relays|pg||
nt|ftpe: yes|pg||
nt|haans: few entries to dummy|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: getting worse after K@H|pg||
nt|haans: well only non vul|pg||
pc|s2|nt|aap00: playing @dQ, not 10 correct - you can discard 3d @d by @c|pg||
nt|aap00: decl has to guess @s and "find" 1 more trick: it can come either from @d or @h |pg||
pc|s9|nt|shevek: maybe they shouldn't be so keen not vul|pg||
nt|ftpe: declarer knows who has king he know|pg||
pc|sT|nt|motu: what about restriced choise|pg||
nt|mcarroll: S looking for N's entry for a @D ruff|pg||
nt|haans: many austrians have played Blue Clubs for 30 years|pg||
nt|MolvaM: specs tell me 3@s shows a no-singleton hand and a bad-bad hand|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: true|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|santyclz: Certainly rates to be a much quicker hand in @cs than @ss.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Now has the problem of guessing the trumps to make 5|pg||
nt|aap00: thk no real chance to go wrong|pg||
nt|ftpe: he will win for sure, but migth take some time :)|pg||
nt|xenya: no -- he will play for @SKxx in the W hand|pg||
pc|c9|pc|cK|nt|yuval10: good def. so far|pg||
nt|yuval10: let's see what line declarer will take....|pg||
nt|davidb: has to play 3 D now - might help (Q D )  the guess|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c6|pg||
pc|c2|nt|collins64: it looks like it'll be +1 for Belgium here|pg||
nt|star6ija: to make or not to make|pg||
pc|c8|pc|h5|nt|haans: we have all learned yes on 8 no on 9|pg||
nt|star6ija: that is the question|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: Greece lost a trick here|pg||
nt|collins64: not anymore |pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hQ|nt|rigas_karo: still|pg||
nt|yannis3012: yes. greek women are losing 10-0 after three boards from russia , one of the favourites|pg||
nt|andersk: -2 for a push|pg||
nt|ady: going down|pg||
nt|shevek: yes, a bid of 3@c/@d or@h over 2NT would show a Max with a shortage|pg||
nt|MolvaM: I see several 4s making with this board in other matches|pg||
nt|andreasw:  i have seen worse 2@s opening before|pg||
pc|d6|nt|haans: not beg difference|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|Gerben42: Netherlands is |pg||
nt|Gerben42: hosting the next Bowl so pre-qualified, but must improve to be in the medal race|pg||
nt|eweber: well, the tournament is not really over yet :)|pg||
nt|Walddk12: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/Events/ebl/2010ostend/default.asp  for convention cards and other useful information|pg||
nt|yuval10: making now|pg||
nt|yuval10: for a double-partial swing|pg||
nt|haans: big|pg||
nt|star6ija: ehhh.|pg||
nt|star6ija: nice guess|pg||
nt|star6ija: saved some IMPs|pg||
nt|aap00: J was last chance|pg||
pc|hT|nt|h_karluk: The Bamberger pair was good at their own sys, got many victories|pg||
nt|xenya: but it's odds in to play for the actual spade disitribution|pg||
nt|xenya: odds on *|pg||
nt|aap00: no squeeze chances, so N has to guess - play on @dJ onside or @hK remaining bare|pg||
nt|ftpe: and both works :)|pg||
nt|aap00: y |pg||
pc|s5|nt|rnmalik: yep|pg||
pc|d7|nt|andersk: actually quite interesting start|pg||
nt|ziff:  @CJ is a bitextreme if he wants to look like someone with a singleton @D|pg||
nt|lmeili: so J@c from JTxx?|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|andersk: Croatia NS aggressive style|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: hand 2 3@D contract also & same lead 4@D |pg||
nt|haans: Fallenius do no like it|pg||
pc|dK|nt|eweber: the open series is being played in two groups for a whole week|pg||
pc|dA|nt|motu: well done|pg||
nt|aap00: certainly, after @sJ odds were on playing for KJx|pg||
pc|d4|pc|dQ|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: nice defense K@D well done |pg||

mb|1D|nt|tomi2:  hi all|pg||
mb|p|nt|motu: hi tomi|pg||

mb|2S|nt|motu: 2@D is 15-19 with any onesuiter or 20-21 NT|pg||
nt|lmeili: wrong side to play @s|pg||
nt|motu: 2@S is 9+ any hand|pg||
nt|andersk: Sorry Im late, was dinner here:)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: however there's transportation problem|pg||
mb|p|nt|eweber: I assume the final will be played with 10 teams given the number of 9 rounds|pg||
nt|h_karluk: its ok, welcome back|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Hi Anders|pg||
nt|yuval10: can they reach 5@c here?|pg||
nt|roswolf: in the other room|pg||
nt|ady: kib has asked for the link for the running score|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 10/11 tricks in @H |pg||
mb|3H|nt|haans: 1@D normal trf|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: no its played with 18 teams, you dont replay the teams in your group|pg||
nt|star6ija: some prospects for making|pg||
nt|cameron_1: David has a much harder time in his 5@d |pg||
nt|aap00: say u have 6 for KJx vs 4 for J10x, but believe that 50% times W will play K with KJx => 3 vs 4 remaining|pg||
nt|haans: normal today|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 1@D meaning  4 card @H|pg||
mb|4H|nt|lmeili: if @c lead & guss wrong of @s|pg||
nt|yuval10: S has good values with A@c and K@h but can she ask about N's distribution|pg||
nt|paulg:  http://tinyurl.com/ebc-open-b   http://tinyurl.com/ebc-open-a   http://tinyurl.com/3yl8spu  for running EC scores|pg||

nt|h_karluk: i wonder west's defense to this one|pg||
nt|andreasw:  1nt force?|pg||
mb|p|nt|andersk: I beleve 2 @C is drury with 3 card|pg||
nt|aap00: no cards for 6 |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 2@S shape & points |pg||
mb|p|nt|eweber: and of those 10 teams 6+NL will play in the Bermuda Bowl|pg||
nt|andersk: Has to switch @D or @C noe, I predeict @D|pg||
nt|ady: this needed a major suit lead |pg||
pc|hK|nt|bagman: quiet lookin partial, declarer probably making 9 tricks|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 3@H  6 card |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 4@H end |pg||
pc|h4|nt|yuval10: did well here, and in the OR as well|pg||
nt|MolvaM: running scores http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/runningscores/asp/roundteamsconditstatclassicmod.asp?qtournid=819&qshowflag=1|pg||
nt|MolvaM: norths 2@c could be the gazilli convention that several pairs play these days|pg||
nt|MolvaM: showing either a natural @c rebid or some sort of strong hand|pg||
nt|ftpe: hearts 5-2, so only 5 spades here|pg||
nt|aap00: so 4 is reasonable contract|pg||
pc|h3|nt|h_karluk: he is supposed to count and protect himself endplayed|pg||
nt|roswolf: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/runningscores/asp/roundteamsconditstatclassicmod.asp?qtournid=820&qshowflag=1|pg||

pc|hA|pg||
pc|h2|nt|eweber: o.k., sorry|pg||

pc|hT|nt|andersk: agree|pg||
nt|ftpe: he now|pg||
nt|aap00: in brd 2 W(!) pushed to 3nt... |pg||
pc|h9|nt|h_karluk: declarer for sure would try long string|pg||
nt|haans: the more @D he plays the better defense|pg||
nt|h_karluk: we will see |pg||
pc|h5|pg||
pc|sQ|pc|s4|nt|Gerben42: changed from last time and will change again next time I guess|pg||
nt|andreasw:  3nt 11 trick's finessing @d|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: lauria's negative double over 2@D warned south off getting involved with his spade suit|pg||
pc|sK|pg||
nt|aap00: for me strange, with 10hcp and passed pd |pg||
nt|haans: not easy clubs finesse|pg||
pc|c2|nt|lmeili: if S ducks @dA|pg||
nt|bagman: I would guess that declarer discards a club on the hearts and gives 2 spades and 2 hearts|pg||
nt|athene: Sementa is prepared to lose his @HK to hold declarer to one heart winner rather than two|pg||
nt|bagman: Sementa's duck gives defense 3 spades instead of 2 spades|pg||
pc|c6|nt|mcarroll: I agree - lets the defence signal very comfortably|pg||
nt|h_karluk: the only possibility to make this a thrown-in play with misdefense of West|pg||
nt|aap00: so, "well deserved" -5 impls|pg||
pc|cA|nt|haans: @H6 even|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|peachy: NS 1H opening might not be everybody's choice, but they play 4-card majors, light style|pg||

nt|odysseus69: who can explain 4S/|pg||
nt|milton_se: maybe Upmark :)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: he would never stick 3NTx  since suit not really solid plus fears about spades|pg||
nt|milton_se: choosing among majors?|pg||
nt|odysseus69: they seem to have a lotof areas of uncertainty|pg||
nt|milton_se: but wouldn't 4C be Cullin's bid then?|pg||

nt|tomi2:  do you play 1@S as 5 cards here?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: iceland lies at the top of the table with 2 more days to go|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 1 more match today and 6 matches the next days|pg||
nt|MolvaM: top 9 ranked teams will qualify for the second stage|pg||
nt|MolvaM: then teams will play a round robin with the teams coming from the other group|pg||
nt|ftpe: south is looking for 6 spades, but cant win here|pg||
nt|haans: 3@C full of danger|pg||
nt|haans: 2@D may have been trf|pg||
nt|haans: more logical|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: not in this position |pg||
nt|haans: but bidding @D twice is?|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: but one never knows in this game |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: what a parnership can bild up |pg||
nt|psridhar: Hi all|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: big think there by N |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: hi |pg||
nt|haans: only 40 hcp exist|pg||
nt|psridhar: two high class pairs facing each other -should be an absorbing contest|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 5@D can be made true will see where he ends up|pg||
mb|4D|nt|rnmalik: but for the @S finesse had a good chance to make it.|pg||
nt|roswolf: never likely to be bid though|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: if thats not a minimum hand I never saw one|pg||
nt|davidb: normal  450 . will be flat all over I believe|pg||
nt|haans: yes both both clear for second rr|pg||
mb|5D|nt|mcarroll: Lebensohl|pg||
nt|andersk: must be the best weak 2 ever|pg||
nt|yuval10: 4+|pg||
nt|tomi2:  Hackett raised to 3@S with only 3 cad support. I play a cuebid by overcaller as 3 card support raise with maximum here, so 3@S would always be 4 cards for me|pg||
nt|yuval10: seem like a nice agreement|pg||
nt|yuval10: you have to play over the @h's in 4@s|pg||
nt|yuval10: Alfredo Versace is going down in 4@s in his match|pg||
mb|d|nt|haans: yepsry|pg||
nt|yuval10: means that this contract isn't so easy |pg||
nt|mamos: this all looks odd|pg||
nt|MolvaM: while the results from their own group will be carried over|pg||
nt|xenya: well if N just had @HA instead of the King... |pg||
mb|p|nt|eweber: 2NT was nat, nf|pg||
nt|mcarroll: I would open 1 @S with that hand|pg||
nt|ady: apart from spades behaving  would need to guess diamond rightr   a poor slam|pg||

mb|p|nt|peachy: with trumps not splitting, this will be tough to play, unless of course EW bids again (I doubt it)|pg||
nt|wygbe1: 6d is pretty  good, but the cards are not friendly|pg||
nt|lmeili: 3@c says 9+ red cards not min hand|pg||
nt|lmeili: tx Rado, 3@s may show sington @c|pg||
nt|tomi2:  what would you lead here?|pg||
nt|lmeili: probably @d, not @s not @h not @c|pg||
nt|tomi2:   seems to cause communication problems, but I cant Imagine to lead a @D from jxx|pg||
nt|motu: i guess i would lead a@H|pg||
nt|tomi2:  seems like a good idea too, in case S has also a singleton you cut this communication|pg||
nt|ziff:  I hope for a @D (obviously), but would lead a @H myself|pg||
nt|motu: with 3@C showing 9 red cards a @D lead looks unatraktiv for me|pg||
nt|haans: Blue Clubs with 5-c M|pg||
nt|cameron_1: I guess Tom chickened out and assumed David was under pressure picking a short major, even so|pg||
nt|ftpe: rigth|pg||
nt|ftpe: 3 spade is probably min and 3-carder in sp|pg||
nt|haans: holy ...|pg||

nt|ftpe: y|pg||
pc|c5|nt|lmeili: he hears |pg||
nt|cameron_1: I think the problem started with Daid's initial choice of 2@c|pg||
nt|cameron_1: rather than X|pg||
nt|aldek: or pass|pg||
nt|cameron_1: the ebu didnt pay it table money to watch him pass|pg||
nt|mamos: hmm   |pg||
nt|aldek: they never pay|pg||
nt|MolvaM: current ranking|pg||
pc|c4|nt|peachy: I dont think even 5 makes|pg||
nt|peachy: but 5 Is certainly reasonable bid, |pg||
nt|andreasw:  and endplay is up|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: there we go 5@D X all |pg||
pc|c9|pc|d6|pg||
nt|haans: good opening VUL|pg||
nt|andersk: I open 2 @S, but my openings are 9-13|pg||
nt|MolvaM: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/runningscores/asp/roundteamsconditstatclassicmod.asp?qtournid=819&qshowflag=1|pg||
nt|psridhar: If north had raised diamonds at his first turn -3d over 2S- he would have avoided bidding at 4 level on his own , like he did here|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: the card play to position of the AQ@H guess|pg||
pc|h4|nt|Gerben42: Rudakov removed because of the @S problem, not because of his good suit|pg||
nt|wygbe1: play off 3 top clubs pitching h's and let e ruff|pg||
nt|peachy: declarer is likely to adopt that line, but then he has to deal with the H, S and club losers in hand|pg||
nt|peachy: might turn out too tuff|pg||
nt|wygbe1: yes, the line that works is to just ruff the 2 low clubs in dummy and draw trumps, finessing against d jack|pg||
nt|wygbe1: even that could run into difficulty|pg||
pc|h2|nt|andersk: If not I open 1|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|haans: dim 2-2 big plus|pg||
nt|haans: @HQ double right|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: he guess correctly seems like @D 2/2 helps sure does|pg||
nt|haans: 2nd opinion: ronsheffy: makes!!!|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
pc|h3|nt|andersk: yes|pg||
nt|peachy: In any case, they avoided the hopeless slam in this room.|pg||
pc|h7|nt|Gerben42: the 4-1 break means that 2@S NS wont make either|pg||
nt|wygbe1: the slam is actually not bad with reasonable splits, but here the splits are not good|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ftpe: declarer playing safe using club ace, afraid off ruffs|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
pc|d2|nt|MolvaM: since scores are carried over it is necessary to do well against the other teams in yr group to have a good chance of winning the vent|pg||

pc|d8|pc|dA|pc|d9|pg||
nt|yuval10: now duck @s perhaps|pg||

pc|dK|nt|Gerben42: running scores group A: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/runningscores/asp/roundteamsconditstatclassicmod.asp?qtournid=819&qshowflag=1|pg||

nt|mcarroll: Absolutely|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|haans: endplay in @D|pg||
nt|haans: easier i N would have played @DJ|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 750 for Israel |pg||
mc|11|nt|Gerben42: group B is broken|pg||
nt|wygbe1: for example, with 22 d and 43 clubs, the slam spreads - |pg||
nt|wygbe1: even with 31 d and 43 clubs has play|pg||
nt|peachy: right. And if it does make, vul slam is expensive to miss|pg||
nt|andersk: Most 1 @S opening does not have 6 tricks, almost incredible that he opened weak 2|pg||

nt|athene: 7@H here - let's see if they find it|pg||
nt|andreasw:  he had 11 trick's|pg||
mb|p|nt|boyklas: it seems that we have some connection problems|pg||
nt|h_karluk: board 6 and 23-0, wonder a recovery possible|pg||
nt|yuval10: not an easy game at all, it was|pg||
nt|yuval10: and now for a goulash hand|pg||
nt|tomi2:  I think 1@C is 2+@C for the German pair|pg||
nt|bagman: In the late 80's  passing out a deal was nearly impossible|pg||
nt|athene: EW might be able to create some confusion|pg||
nt|athene: with 11 -card spade fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|collins64: Mike is going to open 2@c with a weak major 2-suiter|pg||
mb|1C|nt|Gerben42: weak 2 in @D|pg||
nt|Gerben42: refreshingly natural|pg||
nt|eweber: there is a tiny little chance of an endplay vs South|pg||
nt|wygbe1: guess i missed something, down 1 looked pretty easy|pg||
nt|yuval10: really hard to predict what the final outcome here will be|pg||
nt|tomi2:  am no fan of double and no fan of redouble here. what contract does Della Monta want to play doubled, iff ops bid it?|pg||
nt|yuval10: X from S is dangerous in the sense that sometimes P will pass and you have very few defensive tricks for him|pg||
nt|tomi2:  yes|pg||
nt|roswolf: another straightforward board|pg||
nt|bagman: p-p|pg||
nt|athene: 2@S must be a takeout |pg||
nt|bagman: S is confident in his methods|pg||
nt|athene: takeout of spades|pg||
nt|fokal: 2@d shows @s , strong or weak|pg||
nt|fokal: hi all by the way|pg||
nt|athene: maybe 2@S is specifically michaels|pg||
nt|bagman: Is it T/O or 2-suiter?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi.|pg||
nt|athene: many pairs play "leaping michaels" over these bids, so 4@D would be reds|pg||
nt|bagman: hi|pg||
nt|fokal: so I guess 2@s shows a two suiters for sure|pg||
nt|athene: maybe NS don't play that or maybe south prefers to treat his hand as a 3-suiter|pg||
nt|bagman: N has an easy raise of the q-bid :)|pg||
nt|bagman: if methods permit such treatment|pg||
nt|hawe45:  So - I was late from another match|pg||
nt|athene: north pretty much just wants to RKCB in hearts|pg||
nt|athene: but he might have to set hearts first|pg||
nt|MolvaM: double now?|pg||
nt|andreasw:  1@s and 4@h after 3nt|pg||
mb|1H|nt|yuval10: i agree with those 2 arguments you made|pg||
nt|shevek: neither side can make game|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 3nt seems not makable|pg||
mb|d|nt|ziff:  In a marked contrast to our table Scotland and Italy have won 40 and 46 IMP in 5 boards.....|pg||
nt|lmeili: they should reach to 4@h, 1@c-1@d , 1N 2@c|pg||
nt|tomi2:  sometimes pd will jump to 2 level with 4 cards only and you have a hard bidding later|pg||
nt|tomi2:  os della Monatas hand now worth a raise to 6?|pg||
nt|yuval10: i believe W must add now....P is willing to play in the 5 level ALONE when he's VUL, and you have AK A?|pg||
nt|tomi2:  AKtx of trumps and the ace in their suit?|pg||
nt|yuval10: *she's|pg||
nt|yuval10: very likely that we'll see a sacrifice from NS|pg||
nt|tomi2:  if S bids 5@D now w has a difficult bid|pg||
nt|yuval10: Pass forcing?|pg||
nt|tomi2:  E-W are clearly in a forcing pass situation, but do you pass with TWO small dias?|pg||
nt|roswolf: unless n/s get carried away|pg||
nt|davidb: yes  no  great  boards yet...|pg||
nt|ady: can make 6NT    6@S  beaten on heart lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: the axe might descend here|pg||
nt|davidb: ??  aces...|pg||
nt|bagman: Ok, now let's see how the void is shown|pg||
nt|cameron_1: might chooce 4@s since Drijver's X was prob snapfragon style i.e. 2@s 5@c|pg||
nt|aldek: double showing clubs and a doubleton spade|pg||
mb|2H|nt|athene: it's never easy to bid a grand slam which depends on a void (i.e. where you are off an ace)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: still a possible 5 imps missed|pg||
mb|2S|nt|eweber: but NS can escape by cashing their tricks|pg||
nt|lmeili: 2@h 3@h|pg||
nt|haans: close to spade raise|pg||
nt|yuval10: you have to do something with this AKTX trump and A@h|pg||
nt|cameron_1: choose a game i guess, a little strange because most use that to claim "ownership" and show a good hand|pg||
nt|mamos: what strength was 2@h   do we know - forcing ?|pg||
nt|mamos: will england bid on ?|pg||
nt|andreasw:  3nt should not win yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: he ruffed H with the Q, unnecessary|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like another boring hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: empting to Dbl with S hand|pg||
nt|peachy: tempting|pg||
nt|andersk: If 5@C makes, then 3 NT makes too|pg||
nt|bagman: If N can ask aces, S can bid quite a lot|pg||
nt|athene: did south think 4nt was asking for the minor?|pg||
nt|fokal: sementa has no idea of the @s void , he might try to protect his K of @s|pg||
nt|fokal: by bidding NT|pg||
nt|bagman: Now 5@S, I guess|pg||
nt|fokal: obvisously S interpreted 4NT as 'what is your minor , partner ? '|pg||
nt|athene: they might scramble into the grand if south finds 5@S now|pg||
nt|hawe45:  What was 2 @S exactly?|pg||
nt|bagman: It's bad to have your misunderstanding on a grand slam deal|pg||
nt|athene: but if there really has been a misunderstanding it's asking a lot to recover and go on to bid a tricky seven|pg||
nt|athene: 2@D showed spades, weak or strong (or some monster balanced)|pg||
nt|athene: so 2@S was obviously a cue - whatever they play that as|pg||
nt|hawe45:  So 5 @S now might do...|pg||
nt|cameron_1: i imagine tom was happy not to have to guess over an immediate 4@s from Brink|pg||
nt|MolvaM: thomas bids what he hopes he can make|pg||
nt|MolvaM: reasonable bid but doesnt work today|pg||
nt|MolvaM: but maybe pushes opps to 4@h|pg||
nt|xenya: 2N promises 20+|pg||
mb|p|nt|rigas_karo: 4@s in 5-1 fit in the oper room, probably +1|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: looks like an easy 3NT|pg||
nt|boyklas: its difficult to find the Jxx after this bidding, except if he lead it|pg||
nt|ady: should south double if they get to 6@S    might remove to 6NT|pg||
nt|psridhar: difficult to bid 5d on their own last bd- needed push from oppo|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: a part score 2@S by West|pg||
pc|s4|nt|wygbe1: yep it is|pg||
nt|Walddk12: Good morning to Paul Hackett|pg||
nt|wygbe1: and it was |pg||
nt|ady: problem is not there|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w were merciful but have missed the boat somewhat|pg||
nt|cameron_1: it is usally right to bid on know double fit hands|pg||
pc|s2|nt|tomi2:  not hackett should bid 5@H rather than double I think|pg||
nt|ady: sorry    blind spot    2 aces missing|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: can go -1 with a good defence timming|pg||
pc|s7|nt|rigas_karo: well this is an easy way :)|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Morning everyone|pg||
nt|peachy: Good morning Paul|pg||
nt|wygbe1: morning|pg||
nt|yuval10: very interesting sequence to work with your partner|pg||
nt|bagman: When a misunderstaning occurs, it's difficult to recover, because neither player knows what the misunderstanding has been|pg||
nt|athene: even if both players suspect, neither one can be sure his partner is in on the secret|pg||
nt|bagman: If N thinks that S has 1 ace and @S-void, he still cannot bid the grand|pg||
nt|athene: these sort of auctions are where top pairs really have to put in the time away from the table|pg||
nt|athene: because there are lots of imps riding on these hands|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|boyklas: thats true|pg||
nt|athene: even if they don't come up all that often|pg||
pc|sA|nt|Gerben42: this contract will be no problem, will duck once to guard against 5-2 @C|pg||
nt|ziff:  2@Sx would have been 3 down at least on a @D lead or switch, but not easy to find, and 620 are available|pg||
nt|star6ija: 11 tricks|pg||
pc|s6|nt|paulhac:  It is a playable game just but not with the trump break they did well to only go 1 off in the othere room|pg||
nt|lmeili: after 1@c 1@d what is 1N shows? some player holds 7 HCP as E they may not inv to game|pg||
nt|andersk: this will be -2 or more|pg||
nt|MolvaM: what about 5@c?|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s8|pg||
nt|wygbe1: playing for 50 hearts, could set up spades and run them through south for down 1, losintg ak of spades and 2 hearts|pg||
nt|h_karluk: -3|pg||
nt|h_karluk: just play off top hearts|pg||
nt|andersk: I know - 3 double dummy, but they dont see all cards:)|pg||
nt|rodvenn: In practice 3@h is a good bid|pg||
pc|s3|nt|Gerben42: sry always 2nd stopper|pg||

nt|andersk: Just pull it out of your bidding box:)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: can you make a sample bidding?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: LOL|pg||
nt|h_karluk: it should be played by N|pg||
nt|aldek: could not do better|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mamos: surely not|pg||

nt|rnmalik: welcome again.|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hJ|nt|rigas_karo: West bid 4@s over 2@h|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: but maybe he bid 4@c to indicate @c +@s and east (reasonably) passed with singleton @s|pg||
nt|collins64: no Filippos opened 2@h with his 6-card J|pg||
nt|andersk: I understan that 3 @S is a tempting bid|pg||
nt|star6ija: this sequence showed 4-4-4-1 singleton not defined, 2N was relay and 3@c showed @d singleton - 4@h denies control outside|pg||
nt|aldek: the operator is in trouble, it seems|pg||
nt|mamos: vugraph op???????   you there?|pg||
nt|xenya: for the same result|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|collins64: and West bid 4@c with his 55 passed by East|pg||
nt|boyklas: ok, 10 imps for greece|pg||
nt|cameron_1: seems right result|pg||
pc|h8|pg||

pc|h4|nt|peachy: 1|pg||

nt|jameslee 2: to take opps out of the 8 card fit |pg||
nt|haans: 8 carder outside of the law|pg||
pc|dK|pc|dT|pc|dA|pc|d7|pg||
pc|c5|nt|jameslee 2: chance for West|pg||
nt|rodvenn: 8 carder is at the core of the law. This is where it starts|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: guessing @C is home |pg||
nt|psridhar: the law says there are as many tricks as there are trumps|pg||
nt|haans: hard to belie he get this chance|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: a good think & decision wil he put the Q@C or not ?|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|haans: King but be on other side|pg||
nt|psridhar: so if there are two 8 cad fits there are 16 tricks in total|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: he did |pg||
pc|c6|pc|c8|pg||
nt|h_karluk: -3 as i expected|pg||
nt|haans: or not :)|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 2@S = 110 |pg||

nt|bagman: He needs to guess 3 things: a) 5@D shows the 2nd suit, b) S has 2 aces, c) S has @S-void|pg||
nt|athene: well there's no way anyone is guessing all that|pg||
nt|athene: what they need is some way for north to agree hearts|pg||
nt|athene: then it's relatively easy|pg||
nt|athene: but slam auctions are hard when no-one knows what trumps are|pg||
nt|bagman: I'm sure they'll go back to the drawing board after this match|pg||
nt|santyclz: Perhaps 3@s over 2?  |pg||
nt|athene: it's sort of like trying to build the top story of a house of cards and then fill in the first layers later|pg||
nt|psridhar: of course it is genral precription -law can go wrong at times|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|wygbe1: several roads to down one, as long as declarer assumes s has all the trumps|pg||
nt|yuval10: NS in the OR found the 6@d sac.|pg||
nt|roswolf: bd2 was flat when 4@S was also allowed to make|pg||
nt|fokal: on 6@h it seems clear to me that north couldn't make a move|pg||
nt|star6ija: operator, please try to follow the moves more precisely|pg||
nt|cameron_1: flat borad|pg||
nt|mamos: multi|pg||
nt|ftpe: ew migth go to 4 he here|pg||
mb|1C|nt|h_karluk: unless Sweden gifts some seems Austria's this team couldn't scratch something useful|pg||
nt|haans: standard bidding in 2nd hand no 2@H|pg||
nt|yuval10: so "only" 5 imps to Austria|pg||
nt|mamos: i think youd want to be in game|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 5c has much chances if declare can manage the 4-0 split|pg||
mb|1H|nt|peachy: 4H rolls now,, on lucky spade sit|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Although the K@S is right the K@D is wrong so 4@H is an excellent contract|pg||
nt|peachy: EW have a paying sacrifice, rare at Vul|pg||
nt|andersk: Might be possible to bid game here|pg||
nt|bagman: If North was confident that 4NT was RKCB in hearts, that was a good bid; no need to re-cue with 3@S|pg||
nt|fokal: but maybe S could (should ?) have bid something else than 6@h|pg||
nt|haans: the law is not the law just suggestions :)|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: another part score hand |pg||
mb|1N|nt|motu: 1N is 9+  with 4cMajor possible as you can see|pg||
nt|ftpe: ahh, not any longer :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulhac:  Isnt it 800?|pg||
nt|peachy: oops|pg||
nt|peachy: I think I need another cup of coffee!!!|pg||
nt|wygbe1: if n had just shown limit raise values for hearts, they would be in the easy 4h contract|pg||
nt|paulhac:  6@D is only on the K@D 50% almost|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Without a heart ruff|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 4 cards M 4th seat|pg||
nt|andersk: looks like NT has to be played by S, but 5@D makes|pg||
nt|h_karluk: quite gross dissortion|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT   for n/s looks normal|pg||
nt|athene: well, it was only good if he was confident and he knew his partner was confident it was, too :)|pg||
nt|athene: that is one strange double of 1@C|pg||
nt|bagman: In confusion, it's often a good idea to bid something, which can be passed )|pg||
nt|fokal: X from sementa seems artificial|pg||
nt|haans: why did S not bid 3@H|pg||
nt|xenya: my assignment was for Closed Room|pg||
mb|p|nt|rigas_karo: double is transfer for @h?|pg||
nt|fokal: some kind of transfer ?|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes'|pg||
nt|haans: believe it to much and you go wrong|pg||
mb|p|nt|boyklas: maybe|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: should be|pg||
nt|wygbe1: i really think it is wrong to make a neg x with a fit for opener's major, this auction is one example of why |pg||
nt|yuval10: if N bids 3NT here def. must find the @d lead/switch|pg||
nt|bagman: I have never declared a splinter, but my partners have on some occasions |pg||
nt|xenya: sorry private|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d4|nt|rigas_karo: i think anastasiadis will claim 7 tricks here..|pg||
nt|rnmalik: can NS make a slam?|pg||
nt|andersk: @C lead|pg||
pc|d5|nt|collins64: after minor opening and opponent's double they play transfer|pg||
nt|yuval10: 5@c is cold, so many imps here on the line perhaps|pg||
nt|MolvaM: hands seem to be quiet, compared to the previous match|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|boyklas: take 5D, 1S, 1H and leave|pg||
nt|lmeili: though 6@d makable, i would prefer for 3N|pg||
nt|tomi2:  they are on their way to 6@D it seems :)|pg||
nt|motu: 4@D is aceasking|pg||
nt|tomi2:  not 4@C?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: no matter @c lead|pg||
nt|andersk: @C A AQ in @S and @H J|pg||
nt|haans: 5@D jump may be based on previous bidding|pg||
nt|MolvaM: no 7600 distribution so far :)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  sry was away for a bid there:)|pg||
nt|ftpe: well ew had play for 4 hearts, but ns bougth contract in 2 cl on 4-3 fit|pg||
pc|h6|nt|eweber: Imp scoring doesn't seem to work, 5 Imps for Russia until Board 4, if I count correctly|pg||
nt|h_karluk: quickly jettison loser|pg||
pc|h5|nt|motu: 4@C would be aceasking for @S|pg||
nt|tomi2:  but is @S suit possible after not raising?|pg||
nt|lmeili: 4th step shows how many key cards?|pg||
nt|tomi2:  2+@Dq|pg||
nt|motu: 2+ trump Q|pg||
nt|lmeili: tx|pg||
nt|h_karluk: to spades|pg||
nt|h_karluk: overtakes K and enjoys|pg||
nt|roswolf: with the diamonds 3-2 no problem|pg||
pc|hA|nt|paulhac:  Best lead but he could have led anything|pg||
nt|MolvaM: u didnt miss much andreas|pg||
nt|andreasw:  great:)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: declarer tries to protect himself against the 2 diamond honors being offside|pg||
nt|MolvaM: so he just gave up a heart trick that he could establish by taking his @hA|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|MolvaM: the computer dealt hands makes everyone paranoid a little bit after a while|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: good starting duck by S in  trick 1 |pg||
pc|d9|pc|d2|nt|bagman: AK and a low heart?|pg||
pc|dT|nt|motu: everything is possible here:)|pg||
nt|athene: just the five obvious tricks to lose here|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|eweber: no miracle in the 4@h contract, but an imp for Russia anyway|pg||
nt|tomi2:  so 1 kexcard is missing and they stop in (a bad) game - I am no fan of this auction...|pg||
pc|d7|nt|lmeili: at least it makes even guess wrong @s|pg||
pc|dA|nt|h_karluk: just needs to play a trump|pg||
nt|h_karluk: say East played Ace and switched back to @c|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ruff with K|pg||
nt|athene: red ace-kings and a diamond ruff|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: no entrys in West to develope the @D |pg||
pc|h2|nt|collins64: about the previous deal, you always have to discuss before is it or not GF 4@c overcall after weak 2@h opening|pg||
nt|MolvaM: now he can do his throw in|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @h A  favorably placed|pg||
nt|MolvaM: which he didnt need actually :)|pg||
pc|hT|pc|hQ|nt|athene: no chance for the defence to get a trump promotion going and i don't see why declarer should take a backwards trump finesse|pg||
nt|xenya: S showed 5-4 in the minors, but clubs could longer than diamonds, so N had to guess -- hence his pass over 2@C|pg||
pc|hK|nt|collins64: West had a very nice hand with 19HCP and East Pass with 2 Kings and a 7-card Q10 suit|pg||
nt|rnmalik: oops|pg||
nt|haans: we all see the clubs finesse|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
pc|cT|nt|andersk: wrong slam|pg||
nt|andersk: normal line|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 10 @C could come in play |pg||
pc|cQ|nt|collins64: x Kxx Q10xxxxx KJ|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: if 4@c is not GF easts is reasonable however, he thinks the hand is a misfit, and his K@h can be a wasted value|pg||
nt|andersk: a lucky make|pg||
nt|andersk: since @H K is together with 3 card @S|pg||
nt|rnmalik: no on a @H finesse can make 7. @D lead would force him to take a finesse.|pg||
nt|andersk: I must be sleeping, 6 is alw cold|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: Sorry for the rush for the previous deql now we are align with the players|pg||
nt|rnmalik: ok and thanks.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but still may go down|pg||
nt|davidb: board  6  was classical  SPL   -suit preference lead -  high H for D |pg||
nt|ady: ooops     Patchman trying to protect possible entry and clear the hearts|pg||
nt|andreasw:  ok 9 trick's |pg||
pc|cA|nt|motu: i do not see why E went beyond 3N since 2N shoed allready extras|pg||
nt|ziff:  Not easy to bid, as W may have 5 @D and @SA instead of KJ, making slam pretty good|pg||
nt|bagman: No trump promotion but the old fashioned tap|pg||
nt|bagman: Now a heart and ruff with 9 ?|pg||
nt|haans: best not is spades|pg||
nt|aldek: who should bid 4, east or west?|pg||
nt|rodvenn: not vulnerable you should, according to the law, always compete to the 3-level holding 8 against 8. They make, you go one down in the typical example|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|ziff:  Hope springs eternal, as they say, but I agree that it was agressive|pg||
nt|athene: he is more likely to ruff with the queen surely|pg||
nt|MolvaM: but its good for discussions after the match with yr teammates: "I could have made it even if both @d honors were off"|pg||
nt|haans: Body in clubs very good|pg||
nt|rodvenn: of course you may feel that your hand has intermideate cards in their suit which makes you take another course|pg||
pc|c9|nt|eweber: I don't count correcly, 4:1 is correct|pg||
nt|h_karluk: now trump promo possible|pg||
nt|bagman: what would you do then?|pg||
nt|cameron_1: i think they play the method 3m=non max lin linked M and 3M=max in other M|pg||
nt|mamos: I dont think West can    |pg||
nt|haans: endplay in hearts|pg||
pc|c3|nt|rnmalik: No @H finesse 6.|pg||
nt|andersk: East will get a trumph raise|pg||
nt|ftpe: will be poor result for ns i think|pg||
pc|cK|nt|andersk: unfortunate for the sweeds|pg||
nt|h_karluk: the declarer should play a trump to K before touching @h|pg||
nt|cameron_1: so it was up to tom|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|rnmalik: tricky hand after very good lead of @D. we have seen all cards so easy for us.:)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3@S in E is key to its making without finesse also which is % wise low.|pg||
nt|andersk: Austrians|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ruff and do that - now or never|pg||
nt|haans: and a make???|pg||
nt|h_karluk: not really|pg||
nt|h_karluk: if pitches and plays a trump to table goes down to @c shift|pg||
nt|h_karluk: if ruffs and plays a trump to hand always makes, thinner than a hair line|pg||
nt|haans: best play was not to cover|pg||
nt|Walddk12: Good morning to Peter Crouch|pg||
nt|xenya: quite poor, yes|pg||
nt|xenya: 2@D is certainly better, although i'm not sure it makes |pg||
pc|s9|nt|motu: with a decent hand and 5-5 W will make move over 3nt|pg||

mb|2D|nt|andersk: Italy running good in Bridge, but currently out of the world cup|pg||
nt|star6ija: 3N is possible here|pg||

nt|jameslee 2: other room playing 5@D X also on hand nº 5|pg||
mb|p|nt|collins64: both majors at least 44|pg||
nt|boyklas: i think he judged that the hand shouldnt be to game with the singleton S and the KH wasted value after showing C+S|pg||

mb|d|nt|jameslee 2: East a take out 2@D on a dangerous 1Nt X|pg||
mb|p|nt|paulhac:  IF East had been the overcaller one could say that Spain were unlucky|pg||
nt|h_karluk: well, sorry i disagree that was unlucky|pg||

nt|shevek: looks like it|pg||
nt|andreasw:  no best slam with @d AK out:)|pg||
nt|shevek: but 5@d is not a make|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 5d seems ok since defence cannot take their club ruff with a small trump|pg||
nt|rodvenn: Very good bridge to reach 5 @d in both rooms. |pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: or the score is wrong -- that happens from time to time|pg||
mb|p|pc|hQ|nt|peachy: 2NT might have been alerted, otherwise I don't understand it|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 5@d good|pg||
nt|shevek: actually might make|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: second X pass out |pg||
nt|psridhar: this can be set 800|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: quite  a few down -3/-4 could be the result|pg||
pc|h3|nt|wygbe1: probably lebensohl|pg||
nt|santyclz: The 6@h+1 ended as a push.  Neither n/s was able to overcome the preempt.|pg||
nt|star6ija: happens... :)|pg||
nt|shevek: yes|pg||
nt|haans: easier to play 2@D doubles not game sore if make|pg||
nt|psridhar: if defense can find the club ruff-they will get plenty of opportunities for the ruff|pg||
pc|h7|pc|h6|pg||
nt|ftpe: he will try ruff 2 di at hand|pg||
pc|h2|nt|eweber: in board 4 NL managed to win 4 by making 2@d, so 5:4 for them now|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Lebensohl or transfer Lebensohl. Transfer Lebensohl would show both monors|pg||
nt|peachy: even down 1, this be small gain for England|pg||

pc|hK|nt|athene: the auction in the other room looks like an interesting twist on leaping michaels - you bid 4 of the minor you haven't got|pg||

nt|paulhac:  We think Justin is East|pg||
nt|haans: all cards from for Austria but no score i believe|pg||
nt|shevek: not if declarer ducks once?|pg||

pc|s2|pc|s4|nt|rigas_karo: nothing else here i think, @s to the K and claim|pg||
nt|collins64: yes West need to lead A@h to beat the contract|pg||

pc|sT|pc|s9|pg||
pc|sA|pc|d2|pc|s5|nt|boyklas: claim|pg||
nt|lmeili: pretty safe to win @hA if the lead from 4th, set up a @d trick as 9th |pg||
nt|xenya: 9 tricks now on a cross ruff|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|athene: spade force looked the natural play - perhaps Duboin was worried about forcing declarer too much and helping him into a trump coup against north's known heart length|pg||
nt|haans: Fallenius do not like it :(|pg||
nt|psridhar: Fredin must be ruing his decision to upgrade his hand to 1NT opening|pg||

nt|ziff:  I am not surprised....|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: I see that on the rama but no idea on the subject|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: maybe on the slow playing|pg||
nt|tomi2:  yeaterday Nerherlands - Russia was scored as 18-2 VP because of 5 VP for each team|pg||
nt|lmeili: because of slow play?|pg||
nt|tomi2:  yes, as far as I know|pg||
nt|lmeili: that was a heavy penalty!|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: If I have good information they finish 20 minutes late in that match|pg||
nt|tomi2:  10 VP for 20 minutes? thats a lot|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: restarting here|pg||
nt|athene: which means duboin can't have had a count on the diamonds - if he knew declarer had four he would have bashed out that @S10 like a shot|pg||
nt|athene: the standard counter to a 2-suiter being to force declarer|pg||
nt|andreasw:  then a @d to ace and a @s back |pg||
nt|haans: yes dirty upscore|pg||
nt|psridhar: might hv worked on some other layout |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: yes 800 always dangerous|pg||

nt|ady: partial here in spades   Ireland need to keep low|pg||

nt|psridhar: Fredin will briefly consider 3nt b4 bidding 4s when he finds out his pd has unbal hand|pg||
mb|2S|nt|Gerben42: apparently the rooms are connected now|pg||
nt|Gerben42: white vs red NS are very agressive, but as we have seen vuln. they are middle of the road|pg||
nt|eweber: 3@s is not exactly what you'd dream of with the South hand...|pg||
nt|Gerben42: best to not dream but pass with a happy face|pg||
nt|eweber: I assume West is the one who is taking his time here|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Great to see the Irish at the top of the leader board|pg||
nt|josj: as far as I know, they were about 30 mins. late and were eventually fined 3 VP each|pg||
nt|tomi2:  getting informed that they got 3 VP back each|pg||
nt|tomi2:  thx|pg||
nt|athene: ok :)|pg||
nt|aldek: England on the board|pg||
nt|andreasw:  @d to king and alot of @s trick's|pg||
nt|shevek: south can only get in once (@dK)|pg||
nt|ftpe: that opening will probably bring them to 6 spades|pg||
nt|xenya: on 7, the Estonian EW in the other room got to 4@H -- not a bad contract really, but down on foul trump split -- 1 down and 7 imps to Russia|pg||
nt|ftpe: in 6 spades he has to guess spade queen, but best chance is playing on sp 2-2|pg||
nt|haans: 10-13|pg||
mb|d|nt|mcarroll: Unfortunate lie of the cards, but will be the same in the other room  one assumes|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hmmm?|pg||
nt|athene: my guess is they put the board on the table upside down|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hand reversed?|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: ty vugragher |pg||
mb|p|nt|boyklas: FG raise with D?|pg||
nt|boyklas: or 14+ Bal?|pg||
nt|haans: that 1@S overcall???|pg||
nt|xenya: i don't think 6@S is such a great contract -- problems in spades and diamonds|pg||
nt|ftpe: agree, but they will get there after ligth open, |pg||
nt|xenya: well the 3@H bid makes it easier to solve the spade problem|pg||
nt|haans: Fredit pass??????|pg||
mb|2N|nt|ftpe: after 3 he better chance to play north for Qxx in sp|pg||
nt|haans: ERROR|pg||
mb|p|nt|collins64: 2NT is GF with @d|pg||
nt|collins64: GF with 4+ @d|pg||

nt|boyklas: with the AH in his place|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: difficult decision for South here|pg||
nt|andersk: 3 NT?|pg||
nt|peachy: operator doing great job, keeping up with the fairly fast pace at the table|pg||
nt|pitiful:  4@h not timid|pg||
nt|xenya: yes|pg||
mb|3C|nt|rigas_karo: it is safe to bid once again but |pg||
nt|rnmalik: very tempting:)|pg||
nt|mamos: good pressure from South|pg||
mb|3N|nt|collins64: if Mike bid 4@d, Isabelle 4@h they'll play 6@d|pg||
nt|eweber: if anyone of the players|pg||
nt|yuval10: not everyone's X perhaps|pg||
nt|ady: this might cause Irland to get too high|pg||
mb|p|nt|rigas_karo: 4@d or 4NT?|pg||
nt|roswolf: the boards have been swingy - Italy - slovakia 46-0 after 4 boards shows how|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Vul, not for the fainthearted!|pg||
nt|mamos: at least a couple off|pg||
nt|cameron_1: but flat vs. 3@s so|pg||
nt|cameron_1: flatish|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes but N takes the firsst @D trick|pg||
nt|MolvaM: good stop|pg||
nt|andreasw:  first|pg||
nt|xenya: no slam now -- just collecting your money i think...|pg||
mb|p|nt|andersk: opps|pg||
nt|andersk: cold 4 @H|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 4@H +1|pg||
nt|athene: not sure i like unusual 2nt with 6@D4@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: :)|pg||
nt|athene: partner usually bids clubs with equal length which isn't at all what you want|pg||
nt|athene: notice how south can't bid stayman intending 2@S (sign-off) over 2@D|pg||
nt|athene: they obviously play that as something cunning|pg||
nt|athene: we have seen they have lots of relay auctions after stayman so you do lose the ability to bid it on rubbish hands|pg||
nt|shevek: 8 declarer made 3N and 8 went down|pg||
nt|shevek: declarers|pg||
nt|MolvaM: so it must have been a 50% contract :)|pg||
nt|shevek: true, needs accurate defence|pg||
nt|shevek: lol  murat|pg||
nt|xenya: or... who knows?|pg||
mb|p|nt|pitiful:  some play middle encourages and high or low sp in this situation|pg||
nt|shevek: to be fair some went down in 6@d :)|pg||
pc|c2|nt|collins64: he made the wrong choice|pg||
nt|boyklas: all the problems comes here for S because he doesnt know the H or the C Quebid|pg||
nt|boyklas: and he make go down even a 5D|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: at least the did well to avoid 6NT :)|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: 5@d by North is safe|pg||
nt|collins64: Belgium is back after the previous deal|pg||
nt|collins64: Dehaye weak NT forced them to play 4@h for one down|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: very weak NT :)|pg||
nt|boyklas: Manolis choosed to play at the 5-3 fit and not at the 4-4, firstly was thinking that he is playing at th 5-4 fit|pg||
nt|collins64: the bidding was 1NT 8-11 Pass 3@c X and he bid 4@h with his 5-card Q@h and his 4-card 8@s|pg||
nt|ady: they might make this  getting 3 diamond tricks|pg||
pc|c8|nt|dburn: perhaps he should have signalled for a heart|pg||
nt|aldek: and now @DQ|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|collins64: did he actually play the K@h|pg||
nt|boyklas: i dont think so.|pg||
nt|andersk: probably @H 9 lead|pg||
nt|rnmalik: suit worth bidding is worth leading.:)|pg||
nt|haans: most would say "thats not fair"|pg||
nt|davidb: should make on the  D suit |pg||
nt|athene: if north has a pretty good penalty pass here unless he thinks the double is really really offensive|pg||
nt|santyclz: The "DNPA" (does not promise anything) stayman has a lot going for it, but gives up a lot on big hands.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Entame atout - et bonne chance...|pg||
nt|haans: @H to ace to avoid @S ruff|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: strange|pg||
nt|andersk: should make now|pg||
nt|paulhac:  And the other room is 2 boards ahead|pg||
nt|andersk: the famous "almost 1k"  +990|pg||
nt|roswolf: i am told gib says the game can make -in practice i am confident it wont|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Sorry - trump lead - and good luck, I meant|pg||
nt|star6ija: 8+points, 5+@hs|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|peachy: so even faster there|pg||
nt|ady: problem is the tap with the clubs|pg||
nt|star6ija: :)|pg||
nt|haans: claiming time|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mcarroll: Although playing safe after the double 4 is the probable outcome|pg||
nt|psridhar: actually 3nt is superior cont-4s may fail if h ace was wrong|pg||
pc|s4|nt|rnmalik: Possibility only if declarer guesses the entry to W hand.|pg||
nt|athene: Mari shamefacedly trying to shift some diamonds in with his clubs, courtesy of a black pen|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This trick is VERY important, North|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|yuval10: nice guess by declarer|pg||
nt|davidb: D to the 9 = 10 tricks|pg||
pc|s2|nt|xenya: down 4 if W just cashes his high cards now|pg||
nt|ftpe: wow, 3 he in open room :)|pg||
nt|xenya: he will have to do it sooner or later |pg||
nt|ftpe: + 50 not much when close to 1430|pg||
nt|xenya: well E didn't open there, and that made all the difference |pg||
nt|psridhar: not after the X of course|pg||
nt|haans: yep 3nt a make|pg||
pc|sA|nt|hawe45:  Ouf|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
nt|ady: I think can be made playing a diamond to the 9 after Q@S|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes intra finesse position|pg||
nt|pitiful:  still a nice pick up for n-s|pg||
nt|pitiful:  even without the double|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h4|nt|athene: still 800|pg||
nt|ftpe: rigth|pg||
nt|xenya: of course, you could argue that EW might have got in later in the auction, but it's easier to say...|pg||
pc|hK|nt|hawe45:  But less than 500 will be difficult|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|xenya: by the way, i think the E hand is an opener|pg||
pc|s8|nt|mcarroll: Back to +1 after no trump shift|pg||
nt|haans: do not like this |pg||
pc|d3|pc|sK|nt|rnmalik: In the OR K@D was led.|pg||
pc|h9|pg||

nt|roswolf: all hinges on the @D suit|pg||

nt|davidb: H to K & D to the 9 -normal play|pg||
nt|ady: diamond to the ace and diamond to 9|pg||
pc|s7|nt|roswolf: might play @DQ|pg||
pc|d2|nt|xenya: only 10 hcp, but they are good and it's a 5-4-3-1 shape|pg||
pc|d4|nt|athene: if versace doesn't balance - i think that's a sign that pass is right|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|athene: versace not known for his shrinking timidity in the auction|pg||

mb|1C|nt|ady: just 2 aces  in a spades contract|pg||
nt|andreasw:  3nt is makeable here|pg||
nt|xenya: another 10-point opener -- also quite reasonable i think|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 4@S hand nº 8|pg||
nt|haans: natural of balanced hand|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: the 800 hand |pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: hmm a 4 card major opening|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: seems to be turning into a rout. 57 imps in the bag and probably another 11 from board 10, so68-0 at half-time?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 58 excuse me|pg||
nt|haans: we must assume pen dbl not possible|pg||
nt|yuval10: lebensohl now, i persume|pg||
nt|star6ija: partscore board again|pg||
nt|MolvaM: at this point, iceland and italy are the runaway leaders of the group|pg||
nt|ftpe: agree|pg||
mb|1N|nt|boyklas: at the OR 2H is playing|pg||
nt|pitiful:  4@s looks a possible spot here|pg||
nt|xenya: but N's 2@D looks ugly to me|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: guess not|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Hre we are - allez les bleus|pg||
nt|athene: some people think the double jump after t/o double should be pre-emptive|pg||
nt|athene: others play it as limit bid; i.e. better than single jump|pg||
nt|athene: clearly Mari is in the second camp|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 2@S by EW?|pg||
nt|xenya: 4@D is 4 down|pg||
nt|psridhar: 1c opening with 2cl and 5 dia?|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: South could reopen the bidinng with 1nt =9-14|pg||
mb|p|nt|hawe45:  13 tricks possible at any lead, I think - taking for given, that the @D-finesse is working |pg||
nt|MolvaM: 22VP ahead of the 3rd ranked france|pg||
mb|p|nt|andersk: 2@HX is probably -2|pg||
nt|andersk: 3 NT makes tho|pg||
nt|andreasw:  E-w in trouble here|pg||
pc|dA|nt|rigas_karo: impossible to guess the @c position here|pg||
nt|Gerben42: also flat |pg||
nt|peachy: transfer again in N|pg||
nt|haans: good body everywere|pg||
nt|shevek: 4NT two places to play|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: pass out easy to see how mauch|pg||
pc|d5|nt|yuval10: 2NT from S most likely would've make her declarer, as N would've bided 3NT anyway|pg||
pc|d6|nt|shevek: 5@d = @d + @h|pg||
nt|shevek: a bit high here|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|yuval10: at least 10 tricks here|pg||
nt|MolvaM: do we agree with the double of 4@s?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|rigas_karo: this will be down 1|pg||
nt|Gerben42: a perfect fit here|pg||
nt|star6ija: and 3@d|pg||
nt|star6ija: NS|pg||
nt|andreasw:  not at all|pg||
nt|xenya: but 4@H should be easy|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|andersk: looks like the names have been corrected|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Is it true?:)|pg||
nt|mamos: lots of work|pg||
nt|pitiful:  DG will need to guess the trump suit|pg||
nt|mamos: that lead directing opening has resulted in the best lead|pg||
nt|pitiful:  yes a good effort by north|pg||
nt|pitiful:  some might pass the north hand surprisingly|pg||
pc|d7|nt|rnmalik: The contract I mean.|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: that's what I got from thr CR|pg||
nt|athene: if east suspects the 1@H is a psyche he can't be so sure about the diamond finesse|pg||
nt|shevek: I would pass every time|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|paulhac:  With the clubs 3-3 there is no obvious defence|pg||
nt|h_karluk: have no idea why did not touch spades before diamonds|pg||
nt|andersk: SVK- ITA 2-1|pg||
nt|andersk: 10 min left|pg||
nt|haans: i think he did not have a clue were @SJ was :)|pg||
nt|athene: but more likely it's just a shaded opener|pg||
pc|d3|nt|boyklas: he may play well the S, if he play small to the A and see the KS drops he can play small to T now the JXX cant be played|pg||
nt|andreasw:  me to|pg||
pc|h2|nt|ady: claim soon|pg||
nt|star6ija: trump lead is the best for EW|pg||
pc|dT|nt|star6ija: well done|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|Gerben42: making many tricks|pg||
nt|shevek: at least!  :)|pg||
pc|d9|nt|pitiful:  still if he did he would probably be on lead to 4@s anyway|pg||
nt|pitiful:  Gold would open Rolands favourite flannery|pg||
nt|mamos: yes there are two "f" words we mustnt mention this week|pg||
nt|pitiful:  I am rather depressed by the scoreline, hopefully our dutch friends will start doing something wrong soon|pg||
nt|haans: 9-11 as first passed|pg||
pc|s6|nt|andreasw:  lol|pg||
pc|d2|nt|boyklas: he made it|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
pc|h6|nt|rigas_karo: belguim picked up another 8 imps in board 10|pg||
nt|collins64: no|pg||
nt|boyklas: why no?|pg||
nt|mamos: Gold doesnt have many clues as to the outstanding values|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|collins64: why A@c|pg||
nt|haans: well played|pg||
nt|pitiful:  still at least we are better than them at football|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h4|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Carefully played to discard a @H|pg||
nt|cameron_1: are you sure?|pg||
nt|mamos: South holding @HK makes it morelikely that North has @sK   but still needs to finesse 10|pg||
pc|d4|nt|pitiful:  that was just to see how many messages I would get :)|pg||
nt|pitiful:  quite a few|pg||
nt|pitiful:  ...|pg||
nt|mamos: i think you should stick to Bridge Peter|pg||
nt|pitiful:  and no I do not play for Spurs|pg||
nt|pitiful:  perhaps I need to put that in my profile|pg||
nt|dburn: his problem is that he thinks (from the opening bid) that North has the ace of clubs|pg||
nt|pitiful:  this is very tough for TT|pg||
nt|pitiful:  DG sorry|pg||
nt|dburn: in which case he needs to cater for the possibility that North will play the fourth round of diamonds|pg||
nt|dburn: so perhaps he will cash hearts, hoping to pitch West's remaining diamond|pg||
nt|dburn: of course, if he had played a low heart to the queen instead of running the jack, as he probably should have done, he would have a quick entry to dummy now|pg||
nt|ftpe: yes|pg||
pc|s8|pc|h7|nt|mcarroll: Trump continuing the good work|pg||
nt|MolvaM: next question. do you agree with 4nt?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: with 4-4=|pg||
nt|andreasw:  i would pass|pg||
nt|shevek: as I said, I would pass in all positions  lol|pg||
nt|andreasw:  :)|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 8 more for Israel so score 11/2|pg||
nt|psridhar: that dia 3 by Fredin in the 3rd round of dia=sps for h ( 2 for cl and 4 for spd)- obediently Fallenius shifts to H for d2 wd|pg||
pc|cK|nt|haans: now he must try spades|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c5|pc|c4|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Claim|pg||
nt|dburn: but he would doubtless have used that to play for North to hold @sKx rather than @sK10x|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|shevek: flat hand, give it a go, sure pass|pg||
pc|c2|nt|rnmalik: 10 tricks. No damage done.|pg||
pc|c6|nt|rnmalik: sorry-11.|pg||

nt|shevek: BUT....|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|nt|Gerben42: the only way to get higher is to be pushed by opps|pg||

mb|2H|nt|rnmalik: 3NT for Ns.|pg||
nt|tomi2:  in the OR Piekared prefered a double here to 2NT|pg||
nt|tomi2:  ending up as dummy in 2@D, not the contract he was dreaming of|pg||
nt|athene: i am not sure where they went wrong but clearly a wheel came off somewhere|pg||
nt|pitiful:  another lead directing bid|pg||
nt|dburn: I suspect the play went quickly at the end - some of those cards were doubltess not played to the same trick|pg||
nt|shevek: I just had a glimpse at the poles playing in 6@d|pg||
nt|shevek: you too :)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: EW possibly in trouble now|pg||
nt|xenya: perhaps W was concerned about bad splits in the balck suits and 4-1 @Hs, but all was well|pg||
mb|2S|nt|andersk: Est overcalled 1 @S in open room, and South 2 @S, quite strange bidding, anyway NOrway playing 5 NT in open room|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Looks like 4@H should make|pg||
nt|tomi2:  Wladow knows about partnes @C qualitiy, so he won't lead a club now ;)|pg||

nt|ady: 3NT hopless if they lead hearts   |pg||
nt|andreasw:  lol|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: dangerous reopenning here |pg||

nt|haans: but most of us would|pg||
nt|psridhar: South does have a good hand, cant fault him for reopening|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: what will North try to bid ?|pg||
mb|2N|nt|paulhac:  Putting South to the test|pg||
nt|star6ija: 2@d game forcing|pg||
mb|p|nt|rigas_karo: maybe he thought declarer hand 6421|pg||
nt|andersk: same lead as open room, probably 11 and a push|pg||

mb|d|nt|star6ija: 2N no 3@ss|pg||
nt|psridhar: note that S does not have values like unsupported king or queen sitting under the NT opener-he has a 'pure' hand|pg||

nt|star6ija: well oriented|pg||

nt|jameslee 2: problems are arriving for N-S |pg||
nt|psridhar: but 3C x is painful all the same|pg||
pc|sA|nt|collins64: no Mike show count on J@d lead 7 cards so not possible |pg||
nt|MolvaM: to protect the @cQ and against bad breaks,|pg||
pc|s5|nt|ady: got of to a bad lead    but still defence can recover  South will need to play a low heart when in with A@S   and north will have to read the position|pg||
nt|star6ija: decided by the defense|pg||
nt|andreasw:  Magnusson in control here and chose 6@h|pg||
pc|s2|nt|roswolf: the lead was i think another sols flight of fancy|pg||
nt|shevek: good choice|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes had Mag bid a cue Harald would bid 6@d and Mag had to make a choise|pg||
nt|andreasw:  after 4nt from harald ofcourse|pg||
nt|MolvaM: spade lead?|pg||
nt|andreasw:  small @h lead but could cost the beating trick|pg||
nt|MolvaM: and then another spade (when in with @hA) could create problems|pg||
nt|andreasw:  i would lead the @c|pg||
nt|MolvaM: declarer must refrain from cashing diamonds|pg||
pc|s7|pg||

nt|andreasw:  worst lead would be @D|pg||

nt|MolvaM: or barely invitational  :)|pg||
nt|shevek: looks like some weakish non-fit bid|pg||
nt|xenya: 3rd seat... -- still a bit too aggressive to my taste|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 5@D -1 |pg||
nt|psridhar: gr8 contract -the Herbsts hit back !|pg||
nt|haans: 5@D was a bit to much|pg||

nt|psridhar: yes 2 aces and a spd for d1|pg||
nt|haans: 2 aces and a spade|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: there we are 18/12 for Sweden a string come back after they went down 2/11 |pg||
nt|haans: only reason i can find is try to get board 12 back|pg||
pc|cA|nt|Gerben42: this looks at least -1|pg||
pc|c6|nt|paulhac:  Now its all over|pg||
nt|tomi2:  he will be rewarded with friendly breaks all around except of hearts - the best knws he can get. but Smirnov made 4@H so there will ne no huge swing|pg||
nt|haans: different versions of walsh transfer in sweden we bid only 1nt with S hand|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: still a lot to say by both teams |pg||

pc|c8|nt|Gerben42: now at least 2|pg||
pc|c9|nt|eweber: while this one would only promise a swing if the open NS pair weren't playing strong NT, but they are|pg||

nt|shevek: I'm told 2@s is 8-10 , 6@s|pg||

nt|athene: lauria-versace got some way towards 4@H - just not all the way|pg||

pc|s6|nt|rnmalik: cannot rule out an error by the defense.|pg||
nt|eweber: 26:4 now|pg||
nt|MolvaM: the iceland pairs doing extremely well in the event|pg||
pc|sT|nt|MolvaM: one pair ranked 1st in butler with 1,66 imp/board|pg||
nt|MolvaM: other 2 pairs also high with 0,84 and 0,3 plus|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 1,66 imp average over 100 boards is phenomenal|pg||
nt|xenya: well at least it served as a lead director|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|Gerben42: thanks to the 3@S opener|pg||
pc|dA|nt|boyklas: Dehaye didnt find the S lead so again some imps for greece|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 8 tricks|pg||
pc|d2|pc|c7|nt|Gerben42: 3NT is a claimer|pg||
nt|roswolf: israel made 4@S ON 9 BUT had some opp bidding to help them|pg||
nt|shevek: iceland lost their 1st match to italy (14-16)|pg||
nt|shevek: after that won 10 in a row|pg||
nt|andreasw:  must have been a good match|pg||
pc|d5|pg||

nt|eweber: right, over 2@s life is so much easier!|pg||

mb|p|nt|Gerben42: but 10-13 look solid Dutch results|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 4@S|pg||
nt|vasmar: 4@H is a playable contract for N-S|pg||
nt|athene: 2@C is hearts, weak or strong, or strong balanced|pg||
nt|xenya:  i'm told that 2@D was not a multi but a 5M-4m 2-suiter|pg||
nt|xenya: 2@D=18-19|pg||
nt|xenya: so another dull hand|pg||
nt|ftpe: normal 4 he here|pg||

nt|xenya: i'm a bit surprised by the pause|pg||
nt|xenya: ah|pg||
nt|xenya: hope you fix it soon|pg||
nt|xenya: anyway, the Estonian W in the OR did well to get hearts right. making an overtrick and possibly gaining an imp for his side|pg||
nt|ftpe: yes|pg||
nt|xenya: this is getting serious i fear...|pg||
mb|p|nt|shevek: 4@s might be a reasonable spot here|pg||
mb|p|nt|andersk: pls correct to minus 3|pg||
nt|eweber: if the medals were given for speed this table would probably qualify :)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: they will have to wait for their partners quite some time throughout the tournament|pg||
nt|Gerben42: Bauke Muller is not known to be fast|pg||
nt|eweber: 1@d here showed 11-16 with 4+ @d, unbalanced|pg||
nt|Gerben42: showing 4+@D paid off here|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 5@S still cheap for 300|pg||
nt|eweber: and the limit is useful as well|pg||
nt|eweber: in such auctions|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 6@D must be defended carefully, but I think after @S2 lead Drijver will get it|pg||
nt|eweber: with 7 hcp in @s 5@s is an option|pg||
nt|vasmar: double now|pg||
nt|ady: played a diamond to the 9 early on to make 4@S on board 9|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D game try in hearts perhaps but NS should wander into 4@S without too much difficulty |pg||
nt|athene: 3@S pass 4@S now|pg||

mb|1H|nt|shevek: Unfortunately losing 2@h - 1@d - 1@c|pg||

mb|2H|nt|vugraphzng: the CR send me -2 will check|pg||
nt|andersk: ok|pg||
mb|2S|nt|Gerben42: at least the auction heated up some :)|pg||
nt|eweber: no double?|pg||
nt|tomi2:  1@S might have longer clubs than spades, I hope he alerted this :)|pg||
nt|andersk: stoppage time now|pg||
nt|haans: Cullin have it|pg||
nt|ady: very thin balance|pg||
nt|athene: now we have to find the club lead|pg||
nt|pitiful:  Roland is probably glued to the cricket at this moment|pg||
nt|MolvaM: elimination possibilities|pg||
nt|haans: 5@D looked like beginner bridge|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: all nicely placed & good distribution , makes 6@H |pg||
mb|3D|nt|collins64: 5@c just made for Greece|pg||
nt|santyclz: Protecting the @hAQ.  Didn't see that coming.|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt not a bad shot - even when a minor-suit lead is right for the defence it's going to be hard for east to find it|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: West trying to disturb bidding |pg||
mb|p|nt|vasmar: small diamond lead :)|pg||
nt|pitiful:  2@s will play ok|pg||
nt|MolvaM: academic now|pg||
nt|xenya: back to life|pg||
mb|4H|nt|ziff:  No insider jokes please :)|pg||
nt|tomi2:  maybe there will be an appeal and in september they will decide...|pg||
nt|haans: 5@D a make 2|pg||
nt|andersk: OMG ITALY MISSED FROM 5 meters 5 min over stopppage time|pg||
nt|haans: 6@D a make if @H lead|pg||
nt|yuval10: small @s would've been great|pg||
nt|yuval10: then they force declarer|pg||
nt|haans: more likely that E have the Q rather than A = weaker hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzng: NO DOUBLE APPARENTLY|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: sorry for upcqse|pg||
nt|Gerben42: Rudakov didnt know what 5@D showed in defense and Khven didn't count on @DA I guess|pg||
nt|paulhac:  An OK slam|pg||
nt|lmeili: how to show longer @d than @s?|pg||
nt|mamos: was 2@h single or two suited ?  the latter I think|pg||
nt|shevek: phantom got in the way|pg||
nt|MolvaM: tahts the problems with phantoms|pg||
nt|shevek: won't cost much though|pg||
nt|MolvaM: they should stick to hanging out in the operas|pg||
mb|p|nt|shevek: will get away with -50|pg||
nt|shevek: instead of +50|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzng: seems to be clqi;end for -2, correction will come later if needed|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Diamonds 3-3 or doubleton J|pg||
nt|andersk: I have to go for a few|pg||
pc|s6|nt|vasmar: now small diamond works also|pg||
nt|vasmar: if S misguesses|pg||
nt|ady: low diamond lead will beat this|pg||
pc|s3|nt|eweber: non vul doubling for -1 is a bad bargain when the contract may be made, none of them knows about the opther one's quick tricks|pg||
nt|ady: thlow spade lead also good enough|pg||
nt|mamos: just Hearts I'm told|pg||
nt|andreasw:  they were not in 4@s|pg||
nt|shevek: phantoms , yes :)|pg||
pc|sK|nt|peachy: nicely judged|pg||
nt|peachy: as it is, 12 tricks|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Unless he takes a diamond finesse|pg||
nt|peachy: if they duck club, it will be testy|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|ady: heart contract for 9 tricks best  |pg||
nt|haans: he had been thinking|pg||
nt|mcarroll: They dont listen to you Hans :)|pg||

nt|haans: why not clubs to 9|pg||
nt|star6ija: 3rd hand plays high?|pg||
pc|s7|nt|rigas_karo: well, at least this is NV :)|pg||
nt|roswolf: might be a few twists and turns though|pg||
nt|star6ija: no entries for dummy|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 4@H+2 =480 |pg||
pc|s5|nt|andersk: ty|pg||
nt|Gerben42: @H ruff is -2 |pg||
nt|yuval10: she indeed misguessed|pg||
nt|athene: small club after the @DA gives declarer a nasty moment but the odds must be to rise king|pg||
nt|athene: west would indeed lead low from @CQJxx, knowing the suit has to run, but it's more likely he simply has the ace|pg||
nt|aldek: non-vulnerable could be very weak|pg||
nt|mamos: not a great bid then imho   it made any exploration of the hands here impossible|pg||
nt|shevek: Thomas would've bid 4@s if it came around|pg||
nt|andreasw:  and then u could bid 5@c with the risk of being dbl but still u never now|pg||
nt|shevek: true, they bid it to make|pg||
pc|h2|nt|shevek: flat board|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|haans: @H to Q and they forget to take two @D|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 3@D we can take it as a trial bid |pg||
pc|d2|nt|haans: they did forget|pg||
pc|d8|nt|peachy: good lead, gives nothing away|pg||
pc|dA|nt|pitiful:  well if that is your style and it works well for you you tend to stick to it|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|ady: no way to make unless north discards 2 clubs when hearts are run|pg||

pc|h6|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: @d now for -3|pg||

nt|ady: south likely to discard 2 diamonds and a club|pg||

pc|hK|pc|h9|nt|paulhac:  He may be able to work out the distribution in which case he may well go off|pg||
nt|peachy: cashing spades to get information on shapes and discards, not sure if it will help him|pg||

pc|h4|pc|hJ|pg||

nt|jameslee 2: & they are playing 3NT N-S|pg||
mb|2C|nt|haans: 1@H correct?|pg||
nt|yuval10: board 12: 13 imps for Austria, when Germany played 6@c and misguessed the trumps|pg||
mb|d|nt|Gerben42: 1@C was strong, and 3@H creates big problems|pg||

nt|mamos: sorry I have to leave   thanks all  England 5 imps   the fight back begins|pg||
nt|pitiful:  unlucky 13 for the dutch?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: 4@H and still no suits have been shown|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like another routine game for EW?|pg||
mb|2S|nt|rnmalik: For minors-non vul against vul.|pg||
nt|haans: bidding are correct operator say|pg||
nt|pitiful:  this is going to be ugly but could be at most tables|pg||
nt|dburn: what is Gold doing?|pg||
nt|aldek: this will be bloody|pg||
nt|dburn: bidding 4@h in case partner didn't hear him bid 3@h?|pg||
nt|dburn: maybe this is a misprint - it's hard to believe that East really bid like this; perhaps 4@h was really 4@d|pg||
nt|pitiful:  initially David was not enjoying the auction, now it is Tom's turn to join in|pg||
mb|3C|nt|rigas_karo: i think he could go 2 down actually if he cashed one round of trumps after north overuffed with the A@h|pg||
mb|p|nt|vasmar: Spade lead and continuation may set it i think|pg||

pc|sA|nt|boyklas: -2 now with a small H|pg||

nt|dburn: so I guess that's four down|pg||
nt|pitiful:  i was thinking 3|pg||
pc|c2|nt|vasmar: true|pg||
nt|yuval10: will help P not to play @c here|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 1 imp for wales now|pg||
pc|c5|nt|vasmar: she must continue spades now|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|dburn: yes, but you're not defending|pg||
nt|pitiful:  i know 4 looks likely but sometimes 1 gets away |pg||
nt|dburn: oh, sure - no one ever believes how bad the contract actually is|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hA|pc|h3|nt|Gerben42: 13 tops now |pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|dburn: for example, Brink may not believe he can give Drijver a spade ruff, because that would mean East's bidding is completely berserk|pg||
nt|pitiful:  surely not Ace|pg||
pc|d7|nt|ziff:  The contract could be cold, or he might give away the position|pg||
nt|vasmar: now it makes easily|pg||
nt|andreasw:  dosent matter u have no problm in 2@h x if opp,s have the 4@s|pg||
pc|dA|nt|athene: south doesn't see any future in hearts for the defence - he doesn't know how few declarer has, for one thing|pg||
pc|d3|pc|h4|pg||
nt|yuval10: probably with some overtricks|pg||

nt|paulhac:  Good night Raija|pg||
nt|yuval10: as it's cristal-clear where the Q@c is|pg||
nt|vasmar: on a club finesse +2|pg||
pc|s4|nt|eweber: in a diamond contract only 1 keycard missing, but you loose with a @s ruff|pg||
pc|sJ|pg||
nt|pitiful:  e-w in 4@c doubled next door i am told|pg||
pc|h9|nt|vasmar: but risky|pg||

nt|tomi2:  board 12 German open pair bid 7@H missing !AS and Qxx-x in their sidesuit...|pg||
nt|yuval10: yesterday there was something similer to NS in the OR here|pg||
nt|tomi2:  2210|pg||
nt|yuval10: they bided to 7@d|pg||
nt|yuval10: vs Belgium|pg||
nt|yuval10: but they didn't make :)|pg||
nt|vasmar: unlucky :)|pg||
nt|tomi2:  Dr. Wladow always makes his grands|pg||
nt|yuval10: :)|pg||
nt|vasmar: a routine 3NT now|pg||
nt|yuval10: yes, not much here|pg||
nt|vasmar: good board for Austria in order to hold the difference|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: litle reak in the closed room|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: break I mean|pg||
nt|yuval10: thx operator|pg||
nt|vasmar: but boards 14 and 15 are good for Germany|pg||
nt|vasmar: probably they will take the lead|pg||
nt|ady: will west pre-empt with 4 cards in other major?|pg||
nt|haans: spade 4-0 to much|pg||
nt|shevek: this 6@s is claimable at trick 1|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes and should be reach easy|pg||
nt|xenya: bordering on a slam though, as the cards lie|pg||
mb|1H|nt|Gerben42: who would have guessed 210 wins |pg||
nt|eweber: the warm up phase is definitely over, these boards contain explosives!|pg||
nt|ady: should be a lot of bidding here |pg||
mb|d|nt|dburn: that result doesn't seem likely, unless he played it the same way as he bid it|pg||
mb|r|nt|paulhac:  Hi Paul|pg||
nt|roswolf: hmm this could now be very feisty|pg||
nt|star6ija: more undos|pg||
nt|haans: on track :)|pg||
nt|shevek: 1@h response|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: ERROR|pg||

nt|star6ija: undo|pg||
nt|haans: N 3@D????|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: 170 will be flat|pg||
nt|motu: now 3@D would show 4441|pg||
nt|motu: there it is|pg||
nt|roswolf: i think e/w may well declare a heart contract|pg||
nt|roswolf: level is questionable though|pg||
nt|santyclz: 2nt seems a stretch.|pg||
nt|athene: west has a difficult rebid the way the auction went|pg||
nt|athene: 1nt seems a bit of an underbid|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: we are arriving to te last 5 boards and ll in |pg||
mb|1S|nt|ady: J@D lead beats 5@C would have tht west might have gone straight to 4@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|rigas_karo: i guess it will be difficult to stay low here|pg||
nt|tomi2:  Dr. Wladow has some ideas on working / not working finesses in Grand Slams depending on vulnerbility and board number|pg||
nt|ziff:  He has some other ideas as well....|pg||
nt|tomi2:  but I think red/white is "5 or 7, never bid 6"|pg||
nt|roswolf: 5@C WOULD HAVE BEEN MY CHOICE|pg||
nt|roswolf: sorry for the shouting|pg||
nt|roswolf: dont like the pass by east|pg||
nt|andreasw:  strong @c?|pg||
nt|shevek: no|pg||
nt|shevek: 2+|pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|motu: basicly it is related to success|pg||
nt|motu: 4@C is rkcb and 4NT 2+@SQ|pg||
nt|tomi2:  4@C asking for keycards, all aere ther|pg||
nt|ziff:  Let s hope for 7 then (only the Germans, of course, Bulgarians are allowed to hope for 5) ;)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  2 @C might be the solution|pg||
mb|2C|nt|paulg:  4@d an unusual bid with 4-4 minors, but unlucky to suffer this fate compared to 4@c|pg||
nt|paulhac:  This looks expensive for the Spanish|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2:  so havong AQ of dia himself and QJ of hearts he virtualy sees no loser ;)|pg||
nt|motu: 5@C ask for kings|pg||
nt|yuval10: @h lead likely, then many tricks for declarer|pg||
nt|vasmar: only spade lead can embarass declarer but not seriously|pg||
nt|pitiful:  i am told 1 unfortunate south played in 6@s doubled on the previous board|pg||
nt|dburn: did he make it?|pg||
nt|pitiful:  and one east 6@d redoubled !|pg||
nt|pitiful:  well you might have made it David|pg||
nt|pitiful:  but I think he went 1 off|pg||
nt|shevek: wonder why not 1NT|pg||
nt|andreasw:  what about @h?|pg||
mb|p|nt|vugraphzng: There are information that on board 9, it was not put in the right direction in the other room, expect modification|pg||
mb|2D|nt|rnmalik: Routine.|pg||
nt|motu: 5@D= @DK|pg||
nt|lmeili: so he has no @h k?|pg||
nt|tomi2:  @H8 lead vs slam would work nicely, if you have "top of nothing" on your card :)|pg||
nt|ady: now may make an overtrick|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: anoter part score hand |pg||
nt|psridhar: Fredin is quite active making 3 bids ( so far) on his aceless minimum|pg||
nt|psridhar: EW were better off defending 2c i thk|pg||
nt|psridhar: bd 15 sweden passed out 1H -may be a swing for Israel|pg||
mb|p|nt|collins64: what's 2NT|pg||
nt|roswolf: well this seems to be very good for ireland|pg||
nt|ftpe: even poor lead, will go down|pg||
nt|xenya: think he can make?|pg||
nt|ftpe: no way|pg||
nt|xenya: we will see|pg||
nt|xenya: it feels there must be a way|pg||
nt|ftpe: agree, can be exciting, but dont think he will make it|pg||
mb|2N|nt|shevek: 14-16|pg||
mb|p|nt|rigas_karo: 5 top tricks for the defence|pg||
nt|motu: 5@D says nothing about other kings but East is limited to 14 so another K is not possible|pg||
mb|p|nt|boyklas: 16-18 Balanced|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Trump split painful for declarer|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2:  voila|pg||
nt|lmeili: wow!|pg||
nt|ziff:  Seems to be the right board number|pg||
nt|pitiful:  you could probably write a very long article or even a book on just that board, where is David Bird|pg||
pc|c2|nt|rnmalik: 11 tricks.|pg||
nt|ady: dont think east's pass wrong    has already shown values with 2NT|pg||
nt|ady: north sure to get diamonds right|pg||
nt|roswolf: west might/should have bid 4@H but i would have done more as east on this auction|pg||
nt|psridhar: whatever their methods were , this 2nt is not pretty on club lead|pg||
nt|psridhar: i fancy -200|pg||
pc|c6|nt|shevek: no they play mini NT not vul (10-12)|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|paulg:  at least he can pitch a heart on the fourth spade|pg||
nt|hawe45:  120 - next|pg||
nt|shevek: http://tinyurl.com/29ud57z|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|collins64: A@c for the 10@c|pg||
nt|pitiful:  probably watching the cricket with Roland...|pg||
nt|pitiful:  looks like 9 tricks here|pg||
nt|xenya: now 2 hearts pitching 2 diamonds -- that must be his plan?|pg||
nt|ftpe: he probably knows cl 3-3, so maybe will play on clubs|pg||
nt|xenya: but that would lead to a defeat i think -- discarding diamonds i mean|pg||
nt|xenya: and trying to ruff a @D loser in the dimmy|pg||
pc|h7|nt|haans: many plax xx as forcing to at lead 2nt|pg||
pc|h5|nt|collins64: and @s|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: creative bidding would  be my guess:)|pg||
nt|paulg:  although not an ideal start to a doubled four-level contract|pg||
nt|haans: just to tease|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|vasmar: club was not a success|pg||
nt|star6ija: 3rd trump trick apeared|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|ziff:  Of course he didn t lead @H8 as he had no idea where @HA is, but it would sure have been fun :)|pg||
nt|psridhar: S will duck dia queen to cut declarer off his hand|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 23/19 getting closer te match |pg||
nt|psridhar: perhpas Fallenius might hv tried 2S over Fredin's 2D- a much better spot than 2nt|pg||
nt|haans: so fredin just had to countinue bidding|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 2nt a contract you bid but you never play|pg||
nt|psridhar: Israel are in 2H other room as EW|pg||
nt|psridhar: Denmark leading 51-7 vs Estonia after bd 16|pg||
pc|sK|nt|haans: they may open one or two points shorter|pg||
pc|s4|nt|rigas_karo: same|pg||
nt|xenya: in the OR, the lead was a safe a heart |pg||
nt|psridhar: Russia up 4--15 vs Ireland with one bd to go|pg||
pc|s5|nt|vasmar: there may be a club spade squeeze|pg||
nt|psridhar: 40-15|pg||
pc|s2|pg||
nt|paulg:  bidding 4@c would have given someone the option of running if doubled (although never easy to work out when to run) ... 4@d has no such safety valve|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Could easily play East for KQ@C doubleton and go for 800|pg||
nt|xenya: well now he MUST discard diamonds on the hearts |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: big smash there fron denmark |pg||
pc|cT|nt|pitiful:  didn't cash their @s|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|pitiful:  11 now|pg||
nt|psridhar: Bulagria leading italy 33-25 with one Bd o go|pg||
pc|c7|nt|rigas_karo: @s cannot go anywhere|pg||

nt|haans: one extra bid|pg||
nt|roswolf: well i think it should be - this is the european championships|pg||
nt|athene: 4@H normal contract here|pg||
nt|hawe45:  East is playing...|pg||
nt|shevek: well, Denmark played in 6@d!|pg||
nt|andreasw:  i dont drink coffe can anybody tell me what coffee hand's mean?|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: he step 1 less |pg||
mb|4H|nt|Walddk12: Links to Open B  Open A  and  Women|pg||
nt|tomi2:  I would raise him to 4@S|pg||
nt|vasmar: double now?|pg||
nt|haans: suprise for me that 3@H is still invite|pg||
mb|4S|nt|andreasw:  down 2 x:(|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: suddenly everyone's hand seems to have improved|pg||
nt|athene: unlucky to have two trump losers|pg||
nt|MolvaM: apparently they dont like coffee|pg||
nt|shevek: not successfully as you may guess|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 4@H= 10 tricks |pg||
mb|p|mb|d|nt|rigas_karo: with a @h lead, the paly will be very fast...|pg||
nt|motu: i guess he can find the @D position|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @D-shift from North looks needed|pg||
nt|athene: the defence have to lead diamonds at some point|pg||
nt|athene: before declarer gets the clubs going and throws two diamonds on spade and the last club|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Good pass by Magnusson|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2:  official scoresheet says 3nt-1 and the play looks like|pg||
mb|p|nt|eweber: a festival for the weak NT players who find their @s fit :)|pg||
nt|athene: not at all easy for north to lead from Qxx round to Jxx though|pg||
nt|haans: He asked and got NO|pg||
nt|pitiful:  this is a nice spot for e-w|pg||
nt|ftpe: 3 nt was hard bid|pg||
nt|xenya: normal to bid 3N on 25 points, but the game is very thin|pg||
nt|ftpe: punish will come, even if lucky lead|pg||
mb|p|pc|c6|nt|rnmalik: and thought well:)|pg||
nt|tomi2:  my gues is: his intention was "pd pls bid 3nt with a spade stopper"|pg||
nt|athene: it could easily give tricks away|pg||
nt|athene: i assume that @D4 is the @H4|pg||
nt|hawe45:  East found the shift|pg||
nt|andreasw:  if denmark wins now free beer for all|pg||
pc|c9|nt|xenya: N was sort of endplayed on the lead -- any suit he might lead (except @Cs) gives away a trick|pg||
nt|psridhar: are they saving vul vs nv on a 4-4? looks 500 to me|pg||
pc|cT|nt|paulg:  12 tricks looks a lot at the other table|pg||
nt|haans: play clubs at sonest|pg||
nt|haans: soonest|pg||
nt|vasmar: i think that in hearts there are a lot of tricks for N-S|pg||
nt|pitiful:  should make 10 on the layout|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|santyclz: @c back looks safer than @d.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Still tempting though|pg||
nt|shevek: coffee hand is when you need to go to the bathroom and pretend you go to the kitchen :)|pg||
pc|s3|nt|haans: true always is|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: good 4@S if -1 =200 for a 420 opps |pg||
pc|sA|nt|paulhac:  Looks like 12 on this lead also|pg||
nt|vasmar: now 1NT will go 1 off probably|pg||
nt|vasmar: 4 hearts + 3 Aces|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: but seems a 500 againtx a 420|pg||
pc|s5|nt|mcarroll: not enough dummy entries to trap @HK so will lose 2@D,1@S and the @HK|pg||
nt|haans: sweden DOWN|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3@D should be gf and if so west could have bid 3@S when a slam would be reached|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|athene: declarer really played a diamond, not a trump, at trick 2?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Doesn't seems likely.|pg||
pc|h2|nt|rnmalik: Cant play @S that would squeeze the hand.|pg||
pc|h5|nt|eweber: ... or play 1@c|pg||
nt|lmeili: wd!|pg||
nt|MolvaM: coffee hands are the type of hands that allow you to go and get a cup of coffee from the kitchen without worrying about what extremely clever remark you can do here as commentator|pg||
pc|hJ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 1@C is forcing for me :)|pg||
nt|eweber: for those who don't know, Gerben preferably plays Fantunes|pg||
pc|s4|nt|haans: and he should have|pg||
nt|andreasw:  for me it's smooking hand:)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  smoking|pg||
nt|ftpe: 1 nt opening showing 15-17, having 8 as prd, pass is rigth i think, max. is 25 and 8 had no extra|pg||
pc|s7|pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||
pc|c7|nt|roswolf: i think west was a bit lazy here|pg||
pc|c3|nt|eweber: good duck from East here|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, i think E overbid -- possibly for tactical reasons though|pg||
pc|s9|pc|c5|pg||
nt|ady: will make 12 tricks in spades as they lay|pg||

nt|odysseus69: sorry - cant fail|pg||
nt|odysseus69: even with club shift- declarer ok|pg||
nt|ralfwil: I was wrong. set up @d and use @sK as entry|pg||
nt|milton_se: really tough game -- could be 6 imps|pg||
nt|ralfwil: but lucky with only 2 @d|pg||
nt|vugraphznh: Cards still open on table, Barel thinking|pg||
nt|milton_se: Victor said they're lucky already at start :)|pg||
nt|odysseus69: in fact not a bad game- just d ace right and spades no worse than 3-1 wit ds 3-3 or spades 2-2 with ds 4-2|pg||
pc|hA|pc|h4|pc|h5|pc|hT|pg||
nt|milton_se: still a bit under 30%|pg||
nt|odysseus69: how does cc describe 2S?|pg||
nt|milton_se: have no CC but as I recall 10-13|pg||
nt|milton_se: so Upmark is optimistic|pg||
nt|milton_se: what is the time limit? 12.10? 12.15?|pg||

nt|hawe45:  Good bidding system to find 6 @D|pg||
nt|athene: yes, very hard|pg||
nt|santyclz: This is the penultimate bd of the session.  Thanks to the EBU, for providing this for us.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Penultimate - does that mean, that they doÂ´nt play it...?|pg||
nt|athene: the auction in the other room is about how you would expect|pg||
nt|athene: east shows a monster balanced|pg||
nt|athene: west staymans for 4-4 heart fit and then just bids 3nt|pg||
nt|santyclz: Thanks to our operator, Jean-Jacques Thiry, great job!|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: Apparently they replay the board 9, wait for this one soon|pg||
nt|hawe45:  7 @D is not so bad, @C King dropping or @S-hook|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - or a black suit-lead...|pg||
nt|athene: you don't want to play 7@D on a hand like this where it's really likely they will not even bid 6@D in the other room|pg||
nt|shevek: sry andreas but they are 47imps behind with 2 boards to go|pg||
nt|MolvaM: u must have a note on yr cigarette package|pg||
nt|xenya: anyway once E has bid something, they were destined to end up in 3N|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 2 for sweden |pg||
mb|1S|nt|rnmalik: @C/@H Aces were correctly placed.|pg||
nt|vasmar: 4@S here depend on heart play after a club lead|pg||
nt|ftpe: east should pass i think|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 25/22|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: after only 3@S it is very pushy to go to 5@S|pg||
nt|vasmar: sorry they always make|pg||
nt|roswolf: 1nt may be tried|pg||
nt|andreasw:  so no beer,s:(|pg||
nt|MolvaM: smoking makes you miscount the trumps|pg||
nt|shevek: he did say he doesn't want to get old :)|pg||
nt|ftpe: 8 poor points|pg||
mb|2S|nt|xenya: yes, good idea|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: 3NT a big hand in N.|pg||
nt|Gerben42: looks like sure 300 vs uncertain 400|pg||
nt|hawe45:  That logic can not be right at both tables|pg||
nt|athene: 2@D = spades or 24+ notrump|pg||
nt|santyclz: Thanks to my fellow commentators:  William Frisby (England), Hans Werge (Denmark) and those who joined us for parts of the session.|pg||
nt|shevek: aggressive bidding by NS|pg||
nt|ftpe: page 2 in beginners book|pg||
nt|ftpe: 26 for game :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|mcarroll: If they bid 4, defence always take their 4 minor suit tricks|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 2 boards left|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: maybe :)|pg||
nt|haans: xx standard here|pg||
nt|pitiful:  e-w can make 3@s assuming south does not try to cash @c ace|pg||
nt|pitiful:  2@s|pg||
nt|xenya: but maybe he felt that EW in the other room would bid games at the slightest excuse |pg||
pc|s3|nt|roswolf: i would have competed in hearts on the south hand via lebensohl|pg||
pc|s2|nt|paulg:  nasty lead|pg||
nt|paulhac:  This could go a lot down|pg||
nt|paulg:  could easily play South for a 6-4 hand, and leading his second suit|pg||
nt|tomek: cz, jak widzisz|pg||
nt|vasmar: the overtrick on a ruffing finesse in hearts |pg||
nt|pitiful:  double showing a good raise is increasingly popular here|pg||
pc|s4|nt|Gerben42: this might be some artificial sequence|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|andreasw:  should make here unless N-S will find the @c switch|pg||
nt|shevek: they're busy playing @ss though|pg||
pc|d7|pc|dT|nt|vasmar: now the contract is not safe anymore...|pg||
nt|santyclz: Thanks to BBO and Roland Wald for providing this service to bridge lovers worldwide.|pg||

nt|santyclz: (Of course a 60" monitor would help.)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Looks like one too many|pg||
nt|haans: 23.45 central time next session|pg||
nt|haans: 13.45 |pg||
nt|xenya: so he didn't want to create swings|pg||
nt|haans: 10 tricks with @D 3-3|pg||
pc|d2|nt|ady: west wants to clear trumps and then run diamonds|pg||
nt|ftpe: and he didnt :)|pg||
nt|xenya: right :)|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|shevek: declarer might sneak 2 @s tricks and 2@h|pg||
pc|d8|nt|paulg:  good lead, although a spade would have had the same effect|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Unless defence set up a @C for declarer, they should come to 2@Hs and 2@Cs|pg||
nt|ftpe: after this lead down i think|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|eweber: 1NT was nf, so much is known|pg||
nt|vasmar: i don't know if N-S play a 2x1 system and if 3@s would be stronger than 4|pg||
nt|shevek: here....|pg||
nt|psridhar: with 3 kings and a 5 card suit that N hand is a limit raise with 3 trumps to me|pg||

nt|jameslee 2: news : on the oter room playing 4@S with a @H leaad|pg||
pc|hK|nt|ady: israel got 7 on board 14 in the thin 3NT    Ireland played a part score in hearts|pg||
nt|andreasw:  so 10 trick's|pg||
nt|xenya: but this is going to be a huge swing to Estonia|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|tomi2:  don't know where N found a raise to 6 here|pg||
nt|vasmar: probably she thougth that 4@s was a conservative approach|pg||

pc|cJ|nt|rnmalik: when in hand @CQ and !K@C to force W to play Ace @C|pg||

nt|cumino: bilanciatone senza cuori|pg||
nt|rialc2: secondo te non ha tentato il fit a @H?|pg||
nt|pitiful:  and e-w did well to bid and make 5@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: 4@S or 3NT, both the contracts make for NS.|pg||
nt|xenya: spade was led in the OR i'm told|pg||
nt|xenya: W was declarer there|pg||
nt|ftpe: diffcult to lead ace di|pg||
nt|xenya: the @S lead by N looks normal enough, so i withdraw my criticism|pg||
nt|ftpe: withdraw accepted :)|pg||
nt|xenya: and it looks like another disaster for the Russian team is coming|pg||
mb|3N|nt|Gerben42: are you going to raise to "a lot"?|pg||
nt|paulg:  a kib suggests at least taking the ace of diamonds to cash five clubs first and then play a diamond ... which saves a trick|pg||
nt|haans: the delay after W bid is because SE are on other side of screen|pg||
nt|ftpe: more imps for estonia here, dont think he can manage|pg||
mb|p|nt|rigas_karo: last hand, good luck to both teams for rest of the tournament|pg||

nt|tomi2:  now he committes himself to 4 level if pd has no @H fit?|pg||
nt|vasmar: for now Austria gets the lead after the unlucky slam of german|pg||
nt|psridhar: abt 25 % game i reckon ( dia 4-2 wih spd 2-2 also ok)|pg||
mb|4D|nt|haans: 2nd opinion: Rado: 2@H weak 5+@H4+m 3@C pass or correct|pg||

nt|psridhar: that 3S bid is really stretching too far...N thinking of 4s now|pg||

nt|haans: dont ask|pg||
nt|vasmar: S is happy to pass|pg||
nt|roswolf: east will pass?he is normally very reluctant to pass an invitation|pg||
nt|mcarroll: on 19 4@S was made in Open, to account for most of the lead held by Bulgaria|pg||
nt|pitiful:  or at least he will claim that later|pg||

nt|mcarroll: Its Stayman Jim, but not as we know it?|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|ady: might be 1 too high    depends on view in trumps|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: very much so 0-6  4 card is the maximum preempitve |pg||
nt|psridhar: but that 3s worked in pushing Freding into the startosphere 4D|pg||
pc|hT|nt|tomi2:  trump lead|pg||
pc|h8|nt|xenya: N doubled on slender values but 4-4-4-1, and S was happy to pass|pg||
