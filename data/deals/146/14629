nt|paulg:  3@d is a mixed raise, whatever that means|pg||
nt|haans: none ever know what mixed is|pg||
nt|paulg:  four trumps and another useful card is normal I guess|pg||
nt|haans: here a believer in @D singel|pg||
nt|paulg:  Fredin may bid 3@s more for the lead than anything else|pg||
nt|mamos: good morning|pg||
nt|mikael_w: För sverige spelar Cullin - Uppmark som kanske de flesta känner till är nyblivna svenska mästare efter att ha spelat fantastiskt bra hela SM-finalen (spelade dessutom ALLA ...|pg||

mb|2S|nt|lestergold: well decision for Towsend at trick 1|pg||
nt|pikonlu: bu arada turnuvada kazanmanýn dýþýnda , derecede onem taþýyor|pg||
nt|koksoy: 11-13  arasý  bir  yerde finallere baslayabiliriz|pg||
nt|gulyas: 2@S is the limit|pg||
nt|haans: Ireland 2/1 agressive|pg||
nt|haans: Swden Big Clubs Relay|pg||
mb|p|nt|eweber: 2@s shows 4-9 and Sabine is not known for underbidding|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: This appears to be doomed contract.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: on the placement of cards 4@H has a good play for NS.|pg||
nt|dimi: Iceland (200 VP) the current leader of group A is facing Germany (168.5 VP) the fifth of group A |pg||
nt|rnmalik: partial available both sides.|pg||

nt|haans: they do not need muh to open|pg||
pc|c6|nt|haans: 4@D was an invite|pg||
nt|mamos: 2@S shows 5+ 5+ minor 4-9 so about as expected i guess|pg||
nt|arvidsson: De spelar ett starkklöver system (väldigt likt Bernys system) så mycket relä och många zz har vi framför oss)|pg||
nt|daman: NS should make an overtrick|pg||
pc|c7|nt|vbman: yes 2 or 3d|pg||
nt|oliverc: Hello everyone|pg||
pc|c8|nt|ady: anyone know the 1NT range?|pg||
nt|rmb1: Card says (14)15-17|pg||
nt|haans: do not expect a dim loser|pg||
nt|haans: Hi Rashed|pg||

nt|rnmalik: true.|pg||

nt|haans: well lots of @H not correct for bids|pg||
nt|dimi: unfortunately it is not possible to identify the players yet|pg||
nt|Gerben42: possible swing board|pg||
nt|dimi: hello Jan :)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: some pairs will be in 6, unfortunately both opps have an obvious @C lead...|pg||
nt|haans: part of Big Clubs Opening bids have been lower|pg||
pc|s2|nt|Walddk7: Hej Fredrik, Mikael och Eric|pg||
nt|mikael_w: och zz för de som inte vet är ett annat sätt att räkna honörspoäng, där man inte räknar knektar, A=3 K=2 Q=1|pg||
nt|affe82: wlc all|pg||
pc|s4|nt|lestergold: to p,lay trump thru|pg||

pc|d5|nt|haans: hi Roland|pg||
nt|arigun: @d uygun, herne kadar @s 4-1 ise de dikkatli bir oyuna yapabiliryor |pg||
pc|dA|nt|ady: unfortunate top heavy in diamonds opposite singleton |pg||
nt|h_karluk: ty|pg||
nt|haans: and Hi Ben|pg||
nt|mamos: 3NT = bid what you think you can make|pg||
nt|desert: This looks like 1 down......Declarer has 2 discards now and can ruff 2 further diamonds.....|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 2@S+1@H+1@C=4|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lestergold: could well scramble 8 tricks here|pg||
nt|lestergold: and will do well if he does|pg||
nt|lestergold: even one off no disaster|pg||
pc|s6|nt|haans: Hi James|pg||
pc|c5|nt|rnmalik: Cannot shorten trumps from both hands to avoid 4-1 break, small @C to table to play @H.|pg||
nt|paulg:  Hi|pg||
nt|haans: bloddy first board|pg||
nt|benjy:  Hi Roland|pg||
nt|benjy:  Hi guys|pg||
nt|haans: not fun :(|pg||
nt|arvidsson: bäst för försvaret om duck här, vid stöld blir det en enkel resa|pg||
nt|mikael_w: @h sak ser bäst ut|pg||
nt|tez: galler ve ltvanyadan çok iyi skorlar aldýk..bu iki takým kritik durumda..eger onlar ilk 9 a girerse bizim için çok avantajlý olacak|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|s9|nt|arvidsson: med hj sak, blir det enklare att gissa i hj för spelföraren |pg||
nt|arvidsson: ?|pg||
pc|sJ|pc|h4|nt|rnmalik: This would be bid in OR and would be a flat board |pg||
nt|pitiful:  good morning|pg||
nt|eweber: good morning|pg||
nt|mamos: hi Peter|pg||
nt|Walddk12: Hello Elke, Mike and Peter|pg||
nt|gulyas: there was a way to beat it, by playing 4 rounds of @Hs, but that was an unlikely lead (they teach us to lead passively against contracts like this)|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|ady: k@D  the K@S   then 4 hearts is a good spot|pg||
pc|h2|nt|mikael_w: well done to play @h A there and not a small one|pg||
nt|affe82: och @d K?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  If anybody wants explanations about this 2 @D, do not hesitate to write me|pg||
pc|h9|pc|hA|nt|oliverc: This something of a let-off for Israel  -  4@H would have been ugly :)|pg||
nt|pikonlu: evet, ben bugun macarlardan atak bekliyorum. norvecin dusmesi bizim icin avantajlý|pg||
pc|h5|pg||
nt|mdgraham: EW natural with a strong NT. NS Precision with a 12-14 NT|pg||
nt|yusufb: letonya|pg||
nt|james_h: I have a strong suspicion that the underdogs will come out on top here|pg||
nt|gulyas: good stop in both rooms|pg||
mc|8|nt|benjy:  I wouldn't have bid 5@D with the south hand, partner was only competing, he could have doubled 3@D or bid 3@H with a good hand|pg||
nt|pitiful:  2@s not for the fainthearted|pg||

nt|hawe45:  A quiet start, it seems |pg||
nt|daman: nicely played|pg||

mb|1N!|nt|Walddk1: You must connect to the open room|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Hans|pg||
nt|haans: not as bloody as i first believed|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: you should try to win the matches versus the strong teams in the round robin, because those results count later in the final|pg||
nt|mikael_w: hjälper inte att spela @c då|pg||
nt|arvidsson: tursamt nog ser vi alla händer, gör att vi ibland kan analysera rätt :)|pg||
nt|affe82: utspelet gjorde väl i praktiken att s alltid var hemma|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I make coffee|pg||
nt|oliverc: agreed|pg||
nt|haans: Ireland have this match and two more to get up to 9th|pg||
nt|james_h: only 5 teams each from both section A and B right?|pg||
nt|haans: 10-12 1nt|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: Hi Nicoleta|pg||
nt|haans: some say that 1/3 of all IMPs you get in defense|pg||
nt|rnmalik: NT-non vul 11-14?|pg||
nt|paulg:  both teams are (almost) certain to qualify for the second stage, so the matches against the other qualifiers are doubled important as the score will be carried over|pg||
nt|dimi: at the other table Baldursson-Jonsson is facing Pikarek-Smirnov|pg||
nt|gulyas: 9 from both|pg||
mb|4H|nt|Walddk1: You have starated your own broadcast|pg||
nt|xenya: Nicoleta :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/w can make 4@h but will of course be outbid by N/S in spades but at these colours they have good save|pg||
nt|mamos: no it woke us all up with a bang|pg||
nt|dimi: Wladow-Elinescu play a strong @c-system with strong NT |pg||
nt|Gerben42: Baldursson - Jonsson were part of the 1991 Bermuda Bowl team|pg||
nt|mikael_w: ja, efter utspelet så var det nog tungbetat om spelföraren spelade rätt|pg||
nt|affe82: ew ending up in 3@c after a 3rd hand oping by W?|pg||
nt|tez: 5 minor barajý iyi ns için|pg||
nt|koksoy: o  da  iyi  defansa|pg||
nt|koksoy: egale  olacak|pg||
nt|yusufb: 3@d bergen sanýrým|pg||
nt|tez: zonda olmalarý konuþmalarýný zorlaþtýrýyor|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: no cc for this pair|pg||
nt|desert: and even 3 @H wouldnt have been a walk in the park....|pg||
nt|oliverc: no|pg||
mb|p|nt|vbman: how come 2 cl down 3?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: difficult hand to bid, the lower contract the better.|pg||
nt|ady: OR stopped in part score so 5 imps for Russia|pg||
nt|copeyj: Hi All|pg||
nt|h_karluk: lucky 4@s in case allowed|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Hi, welcome Simon|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 6D NS|pg||
nt|lestergold: played by N |pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@S seems a bit drastic|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but the Norht dummy is what you might call suitable |pg||
nt|lestergold: well the upside is that it shuts e/w out whop have good saves|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@s = 7-10 5@s 4m|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Enver Köksoy|pg||
nt|yusufb: @h bilirse 5 olur yoksa 1 imp veririz|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: dubious overcall      but 4@S on|pg||
nt|oliverc: Anyone for a Double by North rather than 1@H?|pg||
nt|james_h: but the final RR consists of only 9 rounds => 10 teams?|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|Walddk1: Pls look at this|pg||
nt|copeyj: you would have to tie south down with piano wire to get him to pass 4@S|pg||
nt|ady: Townsend  4NT   looking for a minor suit contract |pg||
nt|lestergold: double fit hands are the ones you want to declarer|pg||
nt|lestergold: especially before opps find out they have double fit|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the S heart holding is not one that makes 4S an appetizing call. but of course it could easy work well, e.g. by driving EW too high or by keeping thgem from finding their club game ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: or slam|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the reality is that even though NS have a cold slam, they are never going to get to them 4-4 fit unless N is able to open 1NT or the like. with E dealer, you wouldnt expect one top ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: pair in a hundred to reach 6D|pg||
nt|haans: fallenius did not like it|pg||
nt|sga1: Another 4@h contract.|pg||
nt|gulyas: no, they only play against teams from the other group|pg||
nt|gulyas: results carried over from the RR phase|pg||
nt|james_h: ahhhh i c|pg||
nt|haans: 17 round|pg||
nt|haans: yes below 9 to 50th Anniversary Tournament|pg||
nt|gulyas: @D ruff could have taken the overtrick away, not to be, tho, so 11trick|pg||
nt|gulyas: s|pg||
pc|s2|nt|haans: North soon to bid|pg||
nt|xenya: 2@C is weak with @Ds -- or something else maybe|pg||
nt|haans: 2@C weak @D or strong have followers|pg||
nt|xenya: yes|pg||
nt|pitiful:  west pleased not to be doubled|pg||
nt|eweber: a bidding sequence one should have discussed in a partnership|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 2@D seems light at these colors|pg||
pc|s7|nt|h_karluk: well gromov has 5/6 bicolors with a void and decent values|pg||
nt|rmb1: 6@C makes even on @H lead because defence can not cash second heart|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 9 top tricks at NT.|pg||

nt|james_h: EW in the other room play 4cM so is may be dangerous for them|pg||
nt|haans: assume flat board|pg||
pc|h4|nt|rnmalik: On the placement of cards EW can make 9 tricks at NT.|pg||
nt|rmb1: .. but not on a diamond lead|pg||
nt|h_karluk: this won't be easy|pg||
nt|copeyj: gromov will possibly bid 6@S|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i doubt|pg||
nt|copeyj: can't be expensive and the vulnerability is right|pg||
nt|copeyj: Hello all - sorry I am a bit late|pg||
nt|mamos: South probably seen her partner's protective doubles  before :)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  hello to all|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: iceland here is playing a variable no trump range and transfer bid over a 1 cl opening|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Här väljer N att inte fråga efter @s färgen|pg||
nt|haans: we assume the same :)|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|xenya: likely 1 down|pg||
nt|haans: good bidding by South|pg||
nt|h_karluk: already showed intentions and knows his p is not blind|pg||
nt|benjy:  Would you guys bid 3@S with the south hand? Obviously if partner has a fit then you might make a game, but if partner doesn't do you really want him passing or converting to 4@D? Certainly not clear in my opinion.|pg||
nt|pitiful:  looks like 4 or 5  tricks |pg||
nt|arvidsson: 3 @D is the final contract, do you agree on bidding 3 @D Fredrik?|pg||
nt|yuval10: hi all|pg||
nt|desert: well if you think you are strong enough to double 3 Dia later on, you can bid 1 @H :)|pg||
nt|koksoy: bu  bordda  eger  zon  durumlarý  ters  olsa ydý ..  herkes 3@C  diyr  araya  girer, kimse  4@S e  býrakmazdý|pg||

nt|eweber: 1x ppx 1NT and 1x X pp 1NT, especially when you play weak NT|pg||
nt|andreasw:  down 3 i think how did they go down in other table?|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|Gerben42: the 11th trick needs to come from @C|pg||
nt|sga1: Good to stayout of 4@h as it doesn't make.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: bidding looks quite normal|pg||
nt|daman: not the best lead|pg||
nt|sga1: If E had bid 2NT which is not a bad bid, they would be overboard.|pg||
nt|daman: a @D would have been helpful|pg||
nt|oliverc: problem would benwhen Spades get frozen out of the bidding if East bids some|pg||
nt|oliverc: number of Diamonds|pg||
pc|h3|nt|copeyj: he has no idea if it is cold or no play|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: can he avoid 2 club looser?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: could we have the name sof the players please operator?|pg||
nt|desert: If NS play a weak NT and 1 Cl therefore promises 15-17 when balanced thats not so stupid....|pg||
pc|h5|nt|copeyj: but 6@S cheap insurance|pg||
nt|sga1: Both tables playing the same contract :)|pg||

nt|gohar: they deserve penality|pg||
nt|yusufb: cakýlsa sevinir bence|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|copeyj: one advantage of townsend bidding 6@D quickly and confidently|pg||
nt|ady: 300 a decent score for englanf in view of the fact they werer in a minus situation in 6@D|pg||
nt|Gerben42: given the 5-5 distribution he can play Ace and low @C!|pg||
nt|affe82: vilket är ett gott avvägande med den fördelningen i mitt tycke|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|haans: not impressed|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 4@S with @D lead would not make|pg||
nt|haans: nor in Fallanius mind|pg||
nt|pitiful:  J@h swicth would be pretty|pg||
nt|arvidsson: med 4-3-3-3 tycker jag det är ett bra val|pg||
nt|arvidsson: it will definitly go off 1 or 2 depending on play|pg||
pc|d3|nt|pitiful:  !q @d from south might have been clearer|pg||
nt|pitiful:  Q@d|pg||
pc|c4|nt|copeyj: 3 inescapable losers - nothing to the play|pg||
nt|Walddk7: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/Events/ebl/2010ostend/default.asp  for convention cards and other useful information|pg||
nt|copeyj: Townsend & Gold had the fortunate position of sitting out the first match today - fortunate because it was a 0930 start - far too early for your average bridge player :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: as it is 5@C also makes. |pg||
nt|benjy:  This will be another useful pickup for the English|pg||
nt|paulg:  especially as 3@h often has spades, as when you don't have spades then you bid game or pass|pg||
nt|benjy:  I would pass as even when partner has a fit there is no guarantee of going plus. A singleton in partner's suit is very defensive|pg||
nt|haans: whith u|pg||
nt|haans: with|pg||
nt|hedyg: went down on a @c lead|pg||
nt|gohar: yes|pg||
nt|andreasw:  1 sek brb|pg||
nt|yuval10: i don't think they do|pg||
pc|h8|pg||
nt|pitiful:  well done|pg||
nt|hawe45:  To bid ANYTHING with the West-hand is wrong|pg||
nt|hedyg: he could have just ducked the @c and let E ruff and make it|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@H seems to be makeable and that is 620, lets see|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes 4@h should have been won|pg||
nt|hedyg: ducking the @c lead he loses 1@c 1ruff and 1@s|pg||
nt|gohar: yes @c lead|pg||
nt|gohar: down 3 ...|pg||
nt|gohar: 4@h better|pg||
nt|andreasw:  even going up then draw 2@d 2@h ruff a @d and 10 trick's|pg||
nt|affe82: troliga 10 här|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Med 4-3-3-3 tycker jag att det ofta är rätt i partävling, men i lagtävling föredrar jag nog en högfärgsfråga faktiskt|pg||
nt|james_h: phlat board|pg||
pc|hT|nt|copeyj: 5@SX next door so looks like 5 back to England for a tied ball game|pg||
nt|haans: ok so a make but nothing to be impressed about|pg||
nt|arvidsson: faran är om partnen har 5 kortshögfärg|pg||
nt|mikael_w: det är inte förbjudet att öppna med Ax i @h med 2 NT, Och varför ta risken|pg||
pc|d5|pc|c8|nt|haans: when 2!1C may be weak@D opps have more option the just 2@D weak|pg||
nt|vbman: nice spot|pg||
nt|gohar: what abt the other table?|pg||
nt|mikael_w: eller @c för den delen|pg||
pc|h9|pg||

pc|s8|nt|haans: Relays Curse |pg||
nt|arvidsson: vilket man tyvärr får ha i 2nt, men i regel brukar jag tänka kan nt vara rätt? då bjuder jag nt (inget bra tips att ta efter)|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|Walddk4: Typo in South's name, operator   BLAKSET   with a  K|pg||
nt|xenya: operator, S's name is incorrect -- should be Blakset?|pg||
nt|Walddk4: :)|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Thank you|pg||
nt|Walddk4: and perhaps you can insert result on board 1 manually?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Board 1, no more flat 4@H wrong sided and with @D lead -1.|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: elimination of spades and hearts and then the queen of cl|pg||
nt|arvidsson: ok no guesses left for N and no squeeze so 1 of, better for defence would earlier on attacking @H |pg||
pc|s3|nt|paulg:  partner is also still there over 3@H, and with two hearts can always make a takeout double with a decent overcall|pg||
nt|haans: will soon like @DJ|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|haans: you have to bid spades yourselves only you know u have 6|pg||
nt|gulyas: no need, discarding the @D on the @CA|pg||
nt|james_h: I'm also aware of the presence of the Irish team manager here, so I better be on song :)|pg||
nt|haans: we all are on Irland side|pg||

nt|lestergold: hi Simon late... go stand in corner|pg||
nt|mamos: this match must involve the some of the most experienced Women players in Europe|pg||
nt|andreasw:  still even tho he should still have pass that is not a 2@s bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: for their system it is|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I see 10 tricks - in @H|pg||
nt|Gerben42: first to reach 5@D and second to make it|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: i woudnt recomend the 2 dia overcall, bec being vulnerble there is no chance for declaring this hand|pg||
nt|affe82: i 4@s hade @d 9 legat i disken efter 0.1 vilket gjort det kämpigt. om vi haller med generellt eller inte sa kan vi hursom inte klaga pa resultatet.|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Det är inte lätt att ta reda på, men då gäller det ju att ta det beslutet som oftast är rätt, och det vågar jag nog ta gift på är hö-fråga i lagtävling|pg||
nt|arvidsson: 3nt var ett bra resultat för NS, men vill tro att Berny kommer hamna i 3nt|pg||
nt|affe82: de kommer att ha tiden att välja rätt efter en @cl starkt. trolig push|pg||
nt|Walddk1: East is  Pachtman|pg||
nt|yuval10: competitive hand here|pg||
nt|yuval10: looks like P P 1@s ( 2@h ) 2@s  ( X )|pg||
nt|desert: In a 15-17 NT frame thats certainly true....especially as pd often has a weak NT when opening 1@C /1@D|pg||
nt|oliverc: Suspect Spades will be carrying the day|pg||
nt|yusufb: rakip 5@c yapýyo olcak|pg||

mb|p|nt|rnmalik: 4@S for EW, cards are nicely placed with @C 3/3.|pg||
nt|copeyj: strong @C from Dubinin|pg||
nt|rmb1: South following the sound defence against slams - cash your aces and wait for your trump trick(s)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: likely 3n for EW|pg||
nt|marlowepi: even if it goes 1H-1S-P-2H and S gets to bid Ds, the contract is wrongsided. an auction that places declaration of Ds in N hand is hard to construct|pg||
nt|pitiful:  we have a Roland slam now|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes Hans|pg||
nt|dimi: 11 tricks in @h for NS|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: coffee hand- at least should be|pg||
nt|arvidsson: du är en gambler du Micke :) vi kan sammanfatta att det är en fråga om stil nysan hamnade till slut i 4 @S|pg||
nt|mikael_w: kommer inte att bli lätt för N/S att stanna under 4 @s här|pg||
nt|arvidsson: ok west did discard a Heart so declarar made, did not even see that as an possibility|pg||
nt|sga1: May be another contract in @hs unless EW out bid NS.|pg||
nt|oliverc: 4@S possible here given the Club position|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|hawe45:  Sorry @S...!|pg||
nt|koksoy: 5 @D  veya  4@S  oynanabilir|pg||
mb|d!|nt|haans: 2@H two-suiter???|pg||
nt|marlowepi: welcome simon|pg||
nt|hedyg: oh lol|pg||
nt|gohar: 2@s was not his bid i think,,,but they play like this|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This board|pg||
nt|gohar: yes|pg||
nt|Gerben42: standard bidding would be 4@D transfer, because 2@D 2@H 4@H would show slam interest|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Fast som en åskådare precis sa :) Kanske 3 NT igen, och denna gången är det verkligen rätt|pg||
nt|arvidsson: på denna gör man 3nt, men går det att bjuda ?|pg||
nt|sga1: Is the double right or 2@D was the call.|pg||
nt|sga1: I would prefer 2@D overcall.|pg||

nt|h_karluk: very lucky diamonds for the declarer|pg||
nt|Walddk7: I am trying to make our operator insert a  D  in West's name|pg||
mb|4S|nt|h_karluk: pass by Easr quite interesting, perhaps part of their CC|pg||
nt|h_karluk: *East|pg||
nt|ady: e/w have 3NT   easy if playing diamonds from the top   and have other chances even if diamonds are 4-1|pg||
nt|copeyj: Townsend probably thinks e/w have big things on - he will be disappointed in that respect but they are not going to be able to play in 3N now it seems to me|pg||
nt|copeyj: i had duties getting cereal bars for a certain D Gold|pg||
nt|Walddk7: TOWNSEND|pg||
nt|pitiful:  strong @c by south|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@d now?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This should lead to an easy 4 @S|pg||
nt|koksoy: 2or  3@H  by  N is  my guess|pg||
nt|daman: I like 2@D|pg||
nt|henryb:  Now in the US no one would double 1@h with the W hand: 2@d or pass would be the common choices|pg||
nt|yuval10: then decision for N - 3@s or 3@c|pg||
nt|aydinu: bu mac kadar noevec almanya macýda bizimiçin önemli|pg||

nt|hawe45:  I allready se East lead the @D QUEEN..|pg||
mb|d|nt|haans: well not clubs either :)|pg||
nt|shevek: Ron and Blakset play Xfer openings (1@d = @h, 1@h = @ss)|pg||
nt|shevek: 2@h = 5+@h, denies @ss|pg||
nt|shevek: I guess 2@s would've been relay (N/A)|pg||

nt|xenya: yes|pg||
nt|shevek: system cards @@  http://tinyurl.com/29ud57z|pg||

nt|ady: can make 12 tricks|pg||
nt|h_karluk: what a slam|pg||
nt|ady: is possible 4 diamonds passed out|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Good morning to Henry Bethe|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Sorry for the typo in the N-S team name, nothing we can do about it now I'm afraid|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 6@C would become tough with @H placement and 3NT makes against any defense.|pg||
nt|mamos: 1NT is Relay I think|pg||
nt|pitiful:  slam is likely to make if they get there|pg||
nt|eweber: NS plays a variable NT, NT opening nv 1st and 2nd seat 10-12|pg||
nt|daman: the Italians always double with those hands    like to show points rather than shape|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: Good morning all|pg||
nt|h_karluk: a bit double dummy|pg||
nt|hedyg: hmm ok|pg||
nt|arvidsson: givetvis måste man gissa rätt i @C så ingen garanti att gå hem även om den bjuds|pg||

mb|p|nt|rnmalik: Hello all and welcome.|pg||
nt|lestergold: at this colour north may compete|pg||

nt|janhamhurg: 2 heart is funny in my eyes|pg||
nt|mikael_w: man får nog hemgången i utspelet i 3 nt|pg||
nt|arvidsson: svårt utspel för Johan|pg||
nt|koksoy: 3@H  is  alerted  but  seems  natural invitation|pg||
nt|daman: yes|pg||
nt|mdgraham: EW pretty natural, strong NT. NS Strong Club with control responses, strong NT|pg||
nt|sga1: W in OR found another bid on same hand 1NT.|pg||

nt|marlowepi: not sure, E has shown values|pg||
nt|marlowepi: with his minors the other way round hewould probably compete|pg||

nt|hawe45:  Surprise...|pg||
nt|hedyg: there it is|pg||
nt|gohar: :)yes|pg||
nt|arvidsson: om man gissar så  har S visad en svag 2:a I @S med minimum intervall|pg||
nt|rnmalik: good pass by S, no extra values.|pg||
nt|koksoy: spec  says ; its a  conventition  ....  its inv hand  with 6 + 1h and 3 @S|pg||
nt|desert: North now must find at least an invitational bid......according to his system...|pg||
nt|yuval10: N upgraded his hand, you'd have think his KX @h will give him a cold legs|pg||
nt|desert: yes 4 @S is rather aggressive.....|pg||
nt|oliverc: not much doubt about the @C position now :)|pg||

nt|haans: agree hard to take 8|pg||
nt|dimi: true Jan, strange most pairs have greements to show 4 card support after txf|pg||
nt|eamongall: well 5@Cs is just one down as is 4@S based on Daniels earlier comment |pg||
pc|s5|nt|haans: or more than 8|pg||
nt|ady: west has to legislate for a possible bust with east|pg||
nt|lestergold: nice tame contract for eng|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this seems best startr for defense|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I guess the thing about passing, attractive though it may be, is that there is the possibility of being frozen out of the auction |pg||
pc|s7|nt|rnmalik: Good Morning Mike.|pg||
nt|copeyj: depends what pass over 1@S showed|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hearts 3-3, d QJ falls and @cK hook works, cheez n crackers :)|pg||
nt|haans: relays when one ask one responed and asker end up playing 3nt (with his hand) that can be tricy for defense|pg||
nt|haans: been there done it :)|pg||
nt|pitiful:  south did not feel obliged to cue bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: and Bosiger went -1......|pg||
nt|arvidsson: vilket talar för trumf eller hj ut (A sitter troligen hos N) |pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|copeyj: might be that it showed some values|pg||
nt|benjy:  but how to get there?|pg||
nt|jallerton: though the 4-1 @d break gives both trouble|pg||
nt|andreasw:  other table @c K wad the lead and a @h switch|pg||
nt|haans: 3rd best|pg||
pc|cK|nt|lestergold: towsend cannot afford to float this dim|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2H should come in anyway|pg||
nt|lestergold: should be suspicious of the switch|pg||
nt|lestergold: wont comem in if he ducks dim|pg||
nt|copeyj: Askgaard defended very quickly here - Townsend may have picked up on that which may help him to work out what is going on|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he can count five losers if he rises and trumps are ok. but he has to worry about a promoted heart ten|pg||
nt|lestergold: he has safe 8 tricks nowm if he takes the dim|pg||
nt|daman: 3 @D on that collection is very perilous  and he bought a great dummy    if I did that I would go for 800|pg||
nt|sga1: same for me as well :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: only 800? You must buy good dummies|pg||
nt|henryb:  Perhaps only 500. Imperfect defense and great declarer play :)|pg||
nt|daman: I wish|pg||
nt|henryb:  Actually, with the @h raise there is some reasonable chance of buying some trumps in dummy|pg||
nt|sga1: right as max 1@h so good chances r there.|pg||
nt|daman: my dummy would be xxxx x xx xxxxxx   red|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yup|pg||
pc|c7|nt|mdgraham: EW Precision, 1NT=12-15 1st and 2nd, 15-17 3rd and 4th|pg||
nt|ady: what dowes one show with a bust?|pg||
pc|c5|nt|mamos: South knows that for Slam to be good she need a lot of cards from North|pg||
nt|eweber: the NS pair in the other room also plays "variable" as I just see, 14-16 in 1/2 nv and else 15-17 |pg||
nt|andreasw:  was*|pg||
nt|hawe45:  The bidding: 1 @C pas 1 @S pass - 4 @S...|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Better than asking about this bidding, buy the book...!|pg||
nt|tez: @s verecek |pg||
nt|yusufb: evet 9 takým|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|marlowepi: we know he has 8, but he does not|pg||
nt|haans: england can take it|pg||
nt|jallerton: they got there in the other room when W doubled 2@c|pg||
pc|cA|nt|mdgraham: 2@D=weak two in a major, 2@H/@S=two-suited|pg||
nt|haans: imagnative leads not succeeding are not popular|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hello Henry Bethe, welcome.|pg||
pc|s3|nt|daman: well    maybe a Jack or two |pg||
nt|tez: vugrafta 2 maçýmýz yayýnlandý..bu 3uncusu..diðer 2 maçta iyi gitmemiþtik..inþallah bu iyi olacak|pg||

nt|haans: yep 9.30 13.00 16.15|pg||
nt|haans: central time|pg||
nt|haans: hi Jean|pg||
nt|mamos: and the Club weakness has been identified|pg||
nt|pitiful:  well swap south's minors and slam is ok|pg||
nt|mamos: just the trump Q to cause anxiety if EW cah clubs|pg||
nt|hedyg: i dont see how that beats 4@s|pg||
nt|gohar: cant|pg||
nt|hedyg: lose 2@cs and 1@D|pg||
nt|gohar: yes simple and straight|pg||
nt|arvidsson: någon som hade tänkt annorlunda (jag är fruktasnvärt dålig på otur, så försöker få lite tips)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No good lead for West|pg||
nt|affe82: not that I get the bidding but ending in the denomination and level that was expected.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @S bid encouraged N to bid 3@H.|pg||
nt|koksoy: he needs to guess hearts to  make...  he  must give only 2 heart tricks to defence|pg||
pc|c4|pg||
nt|marlowepi: nevertheless i agree he should rise|pg||
nt|lestergold: well he can count a likely 4 hearts dim spade club and club ruff surely|pg||
nt|mamos: cash|pg||
nt|pitiful:  well done by east|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Well-done - the worse lead possible ( J x x x ) was good this time|pg||
nt|affe82: my regular pd has forbidden me to ever lead that. so would have had a hard timing replicating W's good lead here.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @C Queen - and @D to the Queen|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Your regular partner is RIGHT!|pg||
nt|eamongall: so it will be 180 to Sweden first blood of 5 imps |pg||
nt|haans: small price|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|xenya: i'm certain the score should be 4-0 Denmark|pg||
nt|andreasw:  how will u only loose 1@D?|pg||
nt|affe82: blir 11 här|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|copeyj: might be double showing a bust|pg||
nt|eweber: no big surprise that they lead a club if 4@s and 5@d were cuebids|pg||
nt|koksoy: izlanda  takýmý  1993  de  Bermuda  bowl  sampiyonu  oldu...  o  takýmda Magnusson  da  vardý|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|hermandw: thierry, herman hier, ik probeer even of ik met jullie kan chatten - geef even een klein antwoord|pg||
nt|copeyj: opposite strong @C|pg||
nt|gohar: irrespective of any lead|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I really hope, someting is going on - no declarer should use that time on an ordinary game contract|pg||
nt|desert: 10 tricks|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|marlowepi: theh problem, as i said above, is the possibility of a sixth defensive trick via promotion of heart ten|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No @D-loser|pg||
nt|pikonlu: kor kupu var zanetti|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|xenya: can make by overtaking and playing 4 rounds of spades|pg||
nt|h_karluk: honestly dubinin dictated fine|pg||
nt|ady: ok|pg||
nt|haans: happy E have one @H honor|pg||
pc|d3|nt|haans: EW cannot take many clubs|pg||
pc|d2|nt|Walddk5: Welcome to Anders Kristensen|pg||
nt|andersk: Hi|pg||
nt|copeyj: I don't know - but I can't believe E passed facing a strong @C unless it showed something|pg||
nt|andreasw:  2@d looser's?|pg||
nt|hedyg: i give 1 and i ruff 1|pg||
nt|andreasw:  W will over ruff|pg||
nt|hawe45:  NO @D-loser|pg||
nt|hedyg: oh true|pg||
nt|affe82: no it seems strange..|pg||
nt|oliverc: yes. @C now and even though East wioll ruff, the 10@S an entry to take the @C|pg||
nt|oliverc: finesse a second time|pg||
nt|oliverc: well would have been :)|pg||
nt|oliverc: but needed to run the 5@C :)|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|gohar: yes straight hand|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Duck this and finish cross-ruffing for 10 tricks|pg||
nt|affe82: a kibber suggest dropping @s J under A. might give decl a chance to go wrong. at least if on a later board he should get to do the same thing on JTx. kind of interesting play ...|pg||
nt|affe82: really.|pg||
nt|affe82: hans line is better. the drop will prob not happen.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Anyway - no line within some minutes|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Should - in my plan - the third @C be ruffed, you must try the finesse of the @D Jack|pg||
nt|aydinu: bayanlardada aynýsý geçerli fikstür avantajlarý  var|pg||
pc|dK|nt|daman: this is going to work out so well for West|pg||
pc|dA|nt|oliverc: now just ruffing the @C|pg||
pc|d7|nt|Walddk5: Operator, there is a typo in North's name.  EKREN|pg||
nt|andersk: Im not sure what vent wrong here. I like playing 3 @C over 1x-1y-2NT as search for info. Ekrens 4 NT I disagree with, 4333 and actually nothing good exsept for AK A|pg||
nt|hawe45:  To drop the @S Jack is a greek gift |pg||
nt|koksoy: now  he is  safe|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|james_h: there must be logic to 4@s but I dont see it, it probably depends on the function of Dbl|pg||
pc|sK|nt|Walddk5: Reverse the  R and K|pg||
pc|s8|nt|rmb1: X=0-4, Pass=5-7 after 1C-(1x)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that makes sense, ty|pg||
nt|haans: a make|pg||
nt|jallerton: As Ben points out, if  you X what if it goes 3C 3H to you?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: E gets trump promotion in with @HA and @C return.|pg||
nt|james_h: dbl may be majors|pg||
pc|s2|nt|henryb:  and on a @h lead you would take @hA, two @h ruffs, 2@s, and 3@d for 1 down|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|daman: definitely a Matchpoint top|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|xenya: however that was far from clear|pg||
nt|pitiful:  this sort of hand, it is usually a good idea for north to be able to show shortage below game level|pg||
nt|affe82: this is taking forever. cannot really see why. was surprised earlier when russia-netherlands managed to incur 5VPs penalties eeach fro slow play. they are off to a good start ...|pg||
nt|affe82: repeating that here perhaps..|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This is a joke - restricted choice by West - come on|pg||
nt|affe82: the drop really does not put decl to more of a test. playing them small up achieves the same thing really.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  What decl is thiunking about now, he should have decided before touching the @S|pg||
pc|d4|nt|andersk: 3 down|pg||
nt|rnmalik: ensured 7 tricks.|pg||
pc|d8|pc|s4|pg||
nt|pitiful:  the degree of fit opposite shortage is often the key|pg||
nt|haans: agressive bid at VUL|pg||
nt|gulyas: he liked his hand:)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|haans: nope|pg||
nt|mdgraham: good advertisement for an initial 2@D overcall - you get your hand off your chest and can pass with a clear conscience afterwards |pg||
pc|hA|nt|daman: and if they continue to bid @Hs    well that is your second suit|pg||

nt|copeyj: there you go|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so far we have a tied match|pg||

nt|benjy:  you are completely scuppered|pg||

nt|yusufb: bayanlarýn formatta elenme yok 28 takým var lig usulü 27 maç yapýlýyor ve bitiyor|pg||
mb|1H|nt|copeyj: slightly fortunate flat board for Russia - 3NT is where you would want to play I should think|pg||
nt|andreasw:  grand slam look's fair|pg||
nt|hedyg: why useless? good for 7NT?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But South leads the @D Q...|pg||
nt|affe82: dags att tänka in ytterligare en 3nt:are|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No, they will play 4 @S - just like in bridge|pg||
nt|mdgraham: which shows in a way that the requirement for a six-card suit to overcall at the two-level is a bit stringent|pg||
nt|desert: thx to the friendly distribution 4 @S is makeble....but i dont think it will be bid|pg||
nt|koksoy: 5@C  2  tane  pik  alýndýktan  sonra  kýrmýzý  renklerden  squeze  ile  oluyor|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: Blaksets 2@H did cost (was that bridge?)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: that may be a push against 110|pg||
nt|henryb:  it is a poor contract at beat|pg||
nt|eweber: Sally Brock opened a 14-16 NT with the South hand|pg||
mb|1S|nt|h_karluk: easy 4@s for EW players|pg||
nt|mdgraham: two poorish results for the Englsih NS next door - 18-0 Denmark|pg||
nt|copeyj: guess this is what a 5@D overcall looks like|pg||

nt|marlowepi: 3S|pg||

mb|2H!|nt|andersk: Norway EW in open room playing 4@H|pg||

nt|rnmalik: 5@C wins.|pg||
nt|haans: Nyström far behind|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 1@D=?|pg||
nt|benjy:  1@D shows 4+@H|pg||
nt|affe82: still earns them another imp I guess. altman's choice of 3n was a surprise to me.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Sorry, you can NOT ruff a @H - 4 @S is the spot|pg||
nt|koksoy: they  will  reach  4@H  I  suppose|pg||
nt|yuval10: Germany had a chance in the OR when N opened|pg||

mb|p|nt|andersk: probably -1|pg||

nt|affe82: so you don't see him go for the doublefinesse then? lol. no imps. you are right. 11.|pg||
nt|yuval10: perhaps was better to bid invitational X from S than 3@s competitive|pg||

nt|yusufb: bence 1@s 3@s diyen el boyle bir el degil|pg||
nt|aydinu: merci:)|pg||
nt|eamongall: I think EW in the Open room could give another little push ..|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: EW play a 3NT opening as a solid 7-card minor, no outside ace or king - so the West hand is too strong for that|pg||
nt|shevek: well, let's just say the board didn't favour their system :)|pg||
nt|haans: :) lets say that|pg||
nt|copeyj: careful defence leads to down 1|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you cant have everything. you get old waiting for the perfect hand. of course at simon's age we all believe that will never happen:)|pg||
nt|mamos: Board 2 was flat NS collected 150 for getting nine tricks in NT the other way :)|pg||
nt|pitiful:  sort of hand t=you might well upgrade|pg||
nt|eweber: 3@d is a Bergen raise here|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Ah - I see, N/S play Rusinow - North leads the @D Jack...|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: easy dia lead, quick claim|pg||
mb|4H|nt|xenya: it certainly did -- did they fell victim to their own system? Or just to an improper use of it?|pg||
nt|andersk: this will be 9 tricks|pg||
nt|haans: you an opening bid when you have no better|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Sensible to play a jump overcall as intermediate at these colours|pg||
nt|pitiful:  west did too much here imo|pg||
nt|eweber: she probably didn't love to do this with a 4333 distribution, many players treat this like a 3 card trump support|pg||
nt|hedyg: 03 14|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: the 3 is positive|pg||
nt|arvidsson: en så kallad kaffebricka |pg||
nt|daman: they will get to 4@H   and making it is not chopped liver    will probably go one off|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: accurate defence beats this as no entry to take heart finegle|pg||
nt|Walddk7: With a nice club fit Paulissen had a fair shot at 3NT|pg||
nt|henryb:  well yes, but would you do any worse bidding 2@c and raising partner's 2N to 3?|pg||
nt|Walddk7: No|pg||
nt|rnmalik: appears to be a doomed contract.|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Paulissen searching for his 9th trick|pg||
nt|henryb:  Purka seems to have found an effective lead|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Indeed he has; 4th best from your longest and strongest would not have worked this time|pg||
nt|jallerton: still 3@s seems to have made more tricks that 3@D in practice|pg||
nt|pitiful:  although 3@d is no thing of beauty|pg||
nt|Gerben42: notice that Jonsson did not bid after 1@D, almost making it impossible for Smirnov Piekarek to go plus (even 5@D will be hard to make without information)|pg||
nt|koksoy: &  there is a  club  ruff for  the  defence...  |pg||
nt|rnmalik: I have been informed that 1@C is natural or 15-19 balanced hand.|pg||
nt|koksoy: 3@S =  kapalý  minörle  beraber  7-8 el  alýyorum  ,pik  kesiyorsan  3 nt  de|pg||
nt|aydinu: süleyman 4 cl dedi ...|pg||
nt|tez: ataklarýnýz nasýl diye sorulur..cevap.. super:)|pg||
nt|norby: good lead:-))|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: counting 10 :)|pg||
nt|copeyj: its not waiting for the perfect hand - it is the fact that I think the S hand is described pretty nicely by 5@D|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well no argument there. its just that the beautifully descriptve bid might get you past your only game|pg||
nt|lestergold: the 13 imp swing was due to the hand in which the danes overcalled 4@s here nhand 2 in thne open a more conservative 3s and north bid 3n whioch was very unfortunate form england|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if you bid 3S you can still get to 5D|pg||
nt|copeyj: wasnt that unfortunate mike - 3n was not where you want to play the hands|pg||
nt|copeyj: but i agree that neither action taken next door was unreasonable|pg||
nt|lestergold: on hand 2 Sanduist not unreasonably wanted to protect his K@h so bid 3n rathe rthan raise the spades but unfortunately they had rien in clubs|pg||
nt|mdgraham: indeed. Very disciplined of South to pass 3N. Good lead from East too.|pg||
nt|lestergold: no that was very unlucky i would not criticvise sandqvist at all for his action|pg||
nt|rnmalik: only makes on @D lead or misdefense.|pg||
nt|haans: we fram sweden say "not fair"|pg||
nt|jallerton: 1@c is not systemic - as I understand their system 1@c is only short if 18-20 bal|pg||
nt|hawe45:  South denied the @H-control - 650|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West has a maximum NT and will surely go on|pg||
nt|oliverc: 3@S here, surely|pg||
nt|koksoy: bbu  tanýmlamaya  uygun..  2  iceri  8 imp  bize|pg||
nt|pikonlu: 4. demistir herhalde|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: but it could be regarded as too lop-sided for a strong club. Still, that is West's choice|pg||
nt|rnmalik: They are in the best contraact possible.|pg||
nt|haans: from|pg||
nt|haans: clubs or 18-20 bal|pg||
nt|jallerton: Systemically West had a choice between 1@s and 1@d|pg||
nt|arvidsson: inga konstigheter är övertricken vi spelar om här|pg||
nt|mikael_w: en typisk bricka som visar tydligt hur viktigt det är med anpassning|pg||
nt|desert: i dont think so with 4333|pg||
nt|yuval10: quite surprise he didn't|pg||
nt|eamongall: they were losing out 6 imps to letting 3@Cs play anyway ....|pg||

nt|h_karluk: you win if you play ten, you lose if you play K :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I hat to tell you, but 7 @S is ONLY 2.000 = gaining 5 IMP|pg||
nt|hedyg: 7@s?|pg||
nt|affe82: troliga 11. claim inom 4 stick?|pg||
nt|daman: 3NT will have the same fate|pg||
nt|henryb:  Personally, I would rather pass, and balance with double after 2@h-P-P intending to convert 3@c to 3@d|pg||
nt|sga1: After @c no 9th trick|pg||
nt|daman: yes    that would show the hand in a better light     doubling and bidding 3@D?   I would have a much different layout|pg||
nt|henryb:  really? can't North be stripped and endplayed?|pg||
nt|daman: and at least a 6 bagger|pg||
nt|mdgraham: hmm double dummy....win @CQ, 4x@H and 2x@S exit club...|pg||
nt|desert: a good chance to score a plus score on defense......|pg||
nt|oliverc: :)|pg||
nt|gulyas: this looks like 4 losers|pg||
nt|haans: Irland did great to make it OR|pg||
nt|james_h: everyone reads this hand the same|pg||
nt|gulyas: unless you can do something abt a @D, discarding on a @C maybe?|pg||
nt|eamongall: any of our irish kibitzers remember Szabolcs Udivari former partner of Tommy Garvey in the late 80s/early 90s|pg||
nt|eamongall: kibitzer indicates looks off on a @D lead |pg||
nt|gulyas: oh, disaster struck in defense in the OR|pg||
nt|eamongall: I think the 4 tricks remain available on this lead also |pg||
nt|gulyas: @S lead from under the K, and that ran all the way to the 10...|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|copeyj: and the two aces|pg||
nt|copeyj: you are missing|pg||
pc|cK|nt|lestergold: but 13 imps is 13 imps away|pg||
nt|haans: landed right so ...|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|hedyg: oy|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Doubled -|pg||
nt|andreasw:  dosent matter now:(|pg||
nt|hawe45:   I think|pg||
nt|yuval10: should apply to total tricks - he know EW has 9 cards fit in @h and that his partnership has 9 cards @s|pg||
nt|haans: NS must play @D soon|pg||
nt|eamongall: but we need @D switch ...and I don't think it is coming |pg||
pc|d2|nt|shevek: likely improper use|pg||
nt|haans: we must tell them whats suits are :)|pg||
nt|mamos: and East in mine if 3@D shows a limit raise|pg||
nt|andreasw:  i think he should have bid 4@s|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Hade N haft omvänt i rödfärgerna hade han bjudit vidare efter S 2@d och då hade man också gjort slam|pg||
pc|dA|nt|h_karluk: we will see how declarer would tackle trumps|pg||
nt|gulyas: what else can you play into this dummy?|pg||
pc|d7|nt|lestergold: its a cruel game|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, it sure ain't 13 imps in|pg||
nt|arvidsson: nej när spadern sitter snett ;) tror jag inte på claim :)|pg||
nt|mikael_w: efter att man kollat så man har alla A förstås|pg||
nt|arvidsson: 11 med rätt giss i ruter, så kan bli en lång resa till 11 stick|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|h_karluk: nice guess|pg||
nt|ady: yes    2 aces missing     sorry|pg||
nt|lestergold: well it is... for the danes....|pg||
nt|mdgraham: now the defenders need to be careful|pg||
nt|copeyj: well defended by gold here - looks like england will prevail on this board after this start|pg||
nt|lestergold: as it happens the 3s would have worked nicely here but with 9 card suit and i did it pard would be void and idn watch 9 tricks go into the skip|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the next few tricks may take awhile|pg||
nt|lestergold: one of those hands in which partnership informatuion exchange is crucial   ....   and concentration....|pg||
nt|copeyj: England in 3N here next door I am told|pg||
nt|lestergold: well eng need a few back so they had better defend carefully here|pg||
nt|copeyj: which will stop the rot if G&T manage to defeat 5@D here|pg||
nt|marlowepi: without breathing a word of criticism about Tosh's 3S call, the outcome exhibits a cautionary point about preempts. sometimes they preempt us instead of the opponents, and of ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: course we cant always tell when we pick up a hand which side will be victimized. BUT -- once opps have already announced the other major, a preempt has somewhat less to gain|pg||
nt|andreasw:  i dont know theyre system but must be void?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Tuff start at this table|pg||
nt|hedyg: after A@H he can claim|pg||
nt|eamongall: well I was hoping :) |pg||
nt|gulyas: whose side are u on?:)|pg||
nt|eamongall: Roland does not allow us have any sides but changed to support Italians after first 9 rounds |pg||
nt|haans: this match we are all beside Ireland|pg||
nt|haans: they need it|pg||
nt|gulyas: I think you should be allowed to root your own team|pg||
pc|sT|nt|h_karluk: +2?|pg||
nt|affe82: men när han kommer att spela @d sa gör han det till J och 11|pg||
nt|koksoy:  one more chance..  yess|pg||
nt|eamongall: Problem is if all support Ireland ...they carry the loss into the next round |pg||
pc|s2|nt|copeyj: Townsend showing good technique here - he is thinking about all the discards he is going to have to make before making the first one|pg||
nt|lestergold: gold has to discard clubs to show towsend that he only needs to keep ace|pg||
nt|lestergold: think they should / will get this right|pg||
nt|marlowepi: we dont get much practice planning discards against 9-card suits|pg||
nt|lestergold: no point in keeping hearts just needs a spade to get off lead with when club is played|pg||
nt|arvidsson: om inte Cullin vänder i ruter (sista chansen till bet)|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|desert: well you can only use the law when appying all the adjustments....|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|haans: 2nd opinion: nullve: Fantoni-Nunes ville vel også ha åpnet med 2@h der, så da er det vel bridge... ME: they play 2!"H show a mini opening|pg||
nt|eweber: 3@d showed a 4card mixed raise according to their CC|pg||
nt|hedyg: no has to check @ds first|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes:)|pg||
nt|gulyas: 9 teams Q from both groups, A and B|pg||
nt|gulyas: then they play against the other group's Qers|pg||
nt|eamongall: Netherland who hold 6VP from Ireland will be hoping for a large Sweden victory |pg||
nt|gulyas: carrying on the results from the RR for the teams they already played with|pg||
nt|haans: quit true emongall up hill task|pg||
nt|haans: ea...|pg||
nt|james_h: At least the Dutch will definately be at the Bermuda Bowl as hosts|pg||
nt|james_h: I'm also sure they would like to be there on merit|pg||
nt|gulyas: so does that mean 7 teams make it, if Ned is in the top6?|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c7|nt|koksoy: but now there is  no  @S looser|pg||
pc|c4|nt|Walddk7: Drijver led a diamond at the other table, declarer's 9th trick was established|pg||
nt|sga1: That is a possible line definitely.|pg||
nt|daman: is the strip endplay a better proposition than the simple finesse?|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|lestergold: Gold has helped hism pard immediately clarifying the club position|pg||
nt|mdgraham: probably not|pg||
nt|eamongall: 7 teams regardless ... 6 from this and netherlands|pg||
nt|james_h: not sure, but I expect so|pg||
nt|gulyas: yeah, if you put it that way:)|pg||
nt|eamongall: was the same when Portugal hosted ...6 +portugal |pg||
pc|h6|nt|marlowepi: this may be tense but shouldnt be too hard|pg||
pc|h3|nt|james_h: Nystrom postponing the evil moment|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|marlowepi: true, but there uis no way W would ever duck regardless|pg||
nt|pitiful:  well for me east does not have a 3@d bid but it is much closer than the 4@s bid|pg||
pc|hK|pg||
nt|rnmalik: -1|pg||
nt|mamos: WEll is going somewhere about three off so someone seems to have done tooo much|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  W may well be afraid of game bid next door|pg||
nt|daman: South is helping declarer a bit by sluffing @Ds    he might work out the strip now|pg||
nt|mdgraham: still, he has to decide|pg||
nt|henryb:  Assuming North's shape can be worked out from South's discards, and that the @dK is off because of South's two disdards, yes|pg||
nt|daman: great minds think alike Henry|pg||
nt|oliverc: LTT too much like hard work for my liking :)|pg||
pc|dT|pc|d4|nt|lestergold: frankly this is rooutine defence for top class players but in the heat of battle anything can happen|pg||
nt|hawe45:  About 30 IMPÂ´s diff, that @D behave|pg||
nt|daman: South needed to pitch at least one club|pg||
pc|dK|pc|d8|pg||
nt|yuval10: works like magic here - 8 tricks in @h, 10 tricks in @s|pg||
nt|yuval10: even though NS has only 8 cards fit :)|pg||
pc|d5|pc|h2|pc|dQ|nt|rnmalik: no end play etc -1|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|mdgraham: here we go...|pg||
pc|hA|nt|eweber: 3@d wouldn't be my style, I belong to the 4333=only 3 trumps fraction|pg||
pc|h8|nt|sga1: well played|pg||
pc|d9|nt|daman: bravo|pg||
nt|henryb:  APPLAUSE|pg||
nt|eamongall: from foldobug "NL  has a few bad CO Swe=5 ISR=9 and POL=6 for example"|pg||
mc|9|nt|daman: he didn't travel to ostende to take a finesse|pg||
nt|oliverc: South doesn't know that, however, but should be bidding 3@S regardless of the fact|pg||
nt|oliverc: that partner is a passed hand, IMHO, on the basis that partner more likely to have|pg||
nt|oliverc: 5+-card @S and shape|pg||

mb|1N|nt|copeyj: 12 tricks in NT on non @D lead - and on a @D lead you will have to guess whether to play T or Q if played by South (solid played by N)|pg||

mb|3C!|nt|rnmalik: what happened is beyond me:) |pg||
nt|copeyj: no dressing down whatsoever - that's why he is playing and I am not :)|pg||

nt|arvidsson: balanserar man på V?|pg||

nt|affe82: nej|pg||
nt|desert: The german NS pair is certainly very aggressive.......:)|pg||
nt|eamongall: The Obriain brothers here have been putting together a nice butler at .42 per board |pg||
nt|james_h: he might not know that :)|pg||
mb|3N|nt|shevek: 4-cards|pg||
nt|shevek: always unbalanced|pg||
nt|haans: make it harder to find @D|pg||
nt|copeyj: this might have been a good board for england in the closed room|pg||
nt|copeyj: N opened 2@S (8-11)|pg||
nt|marlowepi: ok stout lads, the floor is in good hand, i must away. catch up with you all later:)|pg||
nt|copeyj: but the vulnerability persuaded tosh to try game|pg||

nt|Gerben42: Elinescu may consider passing, facing a weak NT|pg||
nt|Gerben42: ah he did|pg||
nt|arvidsson: ja det var självklart :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 5@D a good playable contract, the question is to bid it.|pg||
nt|koksoy: weak nt... &  double  is  penalty tendency  ..|pg||
nt|henryb:  And East would have to lead a @d to beat it|pg||
nt|desert: i like that :)|pg||
nt|desert: 4 @S needs trumps 3-2 and  a working club finesse|pg||
nt|yuval10: 2@d is weak?|pg||
nt|desert: it looks like intermediate, doesnt it?|pg||
nt|desert: facing a passed hand it might be allegedly "weak" though ;-)|pg||
nt|yuval10: N considering his options...if he X's S perhaps bid 3@c|pg||
nt|pikonlu: bir 7-5 el daha|pg||
mb|p|nt|henryb:  given the result at the other table it cost only 1 imp to bid the game as opposed to stoppint liw|pg||
nt|mikael_w: återigen, en självklar balansering i partävling, i lagtävling är det nog mer en stilfråga|pg||
nt|sga1: Hmmm|pg||
nt|tez: ciao norby|pg||
mb|p|nt|shevek: sry, misread the card|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 5@D a reasonable spot for NS. 3NT also on with 4@S losers.|pg||
nt|marlowepi: meant in sense of "stalwart"|pg||
nt|marlowepi: worthy|pg||
nt|copeyj: 2@C art gf i think for these guys - so Townsend doubling for @C lead|pg||
nt|lestergold: back pedalling Marshall eh?!|pg||
nt|mamos: three off turned out  to be optimistic|pg||
nt|pitiful:  e-w may well end up in 3@d|pg||
nt|eweber: Cristina Giampietro and Pony Nehmert bid 1@s 2@s in the other room|pg||
nt|hedyg: and Roland said that is not a record|pg||
nt|affe82: another push. me I prefer 2@s forcing from Kirmse's hand. no trouble getting to the right spot here though.|pg||
nt|norby: hi all|pg||
nt|yusufb: hi|pg||
nt|arigun: hi norby|pg||

nt|gulyas: oh-oh|pg||
nt|haans: is that BRIDGE?|pg||
nt|gulyas: he probably expected more from pd|pg||
nt|gulyas: if 2@C is artificial, they may not have another way to bid the @C suit|pg||
nt|haans: if he pass N will double|pg||
nt|james_h: he must like his hand :- |pg||
mb|d|nt|janhamhurg: not a good idea i thk, why not 2 dia or 1 no- because they are vulnerable|pg||
nt|yusufb: 2@s der|pg||
mb|4C|nt|copeyj: 1@H = 4+, 2@C = F1, not FG|pg||
nt|haans: 2 hearts loser = no game|pg||
nt|rnmalik: and so will EW in 4@H.|pg||
nt|haans: 4@S have a chans|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 4@H also makes?|pg||
nt|haans: think no game makes|pg||
nt|jallerton: 1NT natural with 4+ @d I believe|pg||
nt|hawe45:  They probably play the 2 @s-bid for a weaker hand|pg||
nt|affe82: oops. yet again I am lost.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Dangerous now - North must have promised a strong NT|pg||
nt|hawe45:  See it fra South, North shall cover 4 out of 5 losers|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Whatever 4 NT is - North must answer|pg||
nt|koksoy: diamonds 2-2  and heart honours friendly seperated  makes 11  tricks in diamond contract..  but  3@D is  enough for  NS|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@S as an opener seems terribly direct |pg||
nt|gulyas: now E will run|pg||
nt|gulyas: W already did:)|pg||
mb|p|nt|arvidsson: men med NS i zonen är nog pass rätt i längden även i partävling|pg||
mb|p|nt|shevek: so 1@d is 4+@d, always unbalanced|pg||

nt|affe82: 630 prob. or am I to be surprised again?|pg||
nt|koksoy: wow..  we  forgot agressive E  :)|pg||

nt|mdgraham: but leads to a terribly direct 620|pg||
nt|koksoy: sevgili  ortagým  bu  boardu  senle  paylastým  :)|pg||
nt|haans: unlucky is that opps 3@H no a make|pg||
nt|eamongall: why why why |pg||
pc|d2|nt|shevek: I used to say that...but...|pg||
nt|copeyj: wow|pg||
nt|rnmalik: shall see, 2@H+1@S=3.|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|dimi: this will be to much|pg||
nt|dimi: -1 likely outcome|pg||
nt|Gerben42: Magnusson meant 2@S as purely comp.|pg||
nt|eamongall: to have some more 50s |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|shevek: lost a few tight finals :)|pg||
nt|haans: Fredit leads magain|pg||
nt|haans: Fredin|pg||
nt|shevek: agree, not a standard lead :)|pg||
nt|xenya: the layout is quite friendly |pg||
nt|ady: got 12 easy tricks without a diamond lead|pg||
nt|copeyj: 2@S fourth suit, 3N showed non minimum, and 6N was music to my biased ears|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Townsend there, buckle up please (personally m confused why didn't search controls)|pg||
nt|ady: as cards are  better played by North who has not losing choise on a diamond lead|pg||
nt|copeyj: maybe 2@C was not gf - let me find their card|pg||
nt|mdgraham: It doesn't look as though 2@C is FG|pg||
nt|lestergold: well they have just cdemnonstrated that it isnt|pg||
nt|lestergold: this is prob only 1 0ff so another 3 likely to Denmark|pg||
nt|copeyj: 1M - 2@C = @D Sign-offOR any INV w/o fit, w/o 5+OM.|pg||
nt|copeyj: according to their card|pg||
nt|lestergold: actually it may make|pg||
nt|copeyj: and apparently 2@D showed @D support |pg||
nt|pitiful:  and east 3@d|pg||
nt|hedyg: with the right defense...|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: now they play 4- probably - 1, but makes if you find the club queen|pg||
nt|Gerben42: but Haraldsson expected perhaps a tiny bit more than this junkyard|pg||
nt|gulyas: this could be beaten if they play @Ss in time|pg||
nt|haans: yes did he believe any M to make|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|copeyj: i think Townsend will need to underlead his @C to get partner in to lead @H through |pg||
nt|lestergold: and if it makes that s a heftier 8 imps in for the danes|pg||
nt|copeyj: although bjarnarson can play A@D then AKQ@S pitching a @C|pg||
nt|lestergold: on this lead townsend has to find an underlead to put goldin for heart thru to beat this|pg||
nt|copeyj: declarer can always make now mike|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes decline finesse and play on spades so another 8 away no doubt|pg||
nt|haans: kibs believe in 4@H easy make |pg||
nt|paulg:  Townsend-Gold have clearly changed the system from their published convention card, which says that 1NT is game forcing with diamonds|pg||
nt|mamos: :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Lead a small @H - and South will play for the @C-finesse|pg||
nt|yusufb: tezcanýn dedigi gibi baþtan 3@s dese þimdi pas gecerken daha rahat olurdu|pg||

nt|shevek: lol|pg||
nt|shevek: they played together b4|pg||
nt|haans: true|pg||
nt|shevek: never underlead a queen?  :)|pg||
nt|xenya: seems 11 tricks can be made|pg||
nt|desert: facing a 10-13 hand i would have Xed with the east hand.....|pg||
nt|oliverc: I agree. strange that he's bid 1@H on Board 2, but makes a negative double here|pg||
nt|yuval10: EW not on the same page i believe|pg||
nt|desert: to prevent THIS ;-)|pg||
nt|oliverc: doesn't look that way|pg||
nt|eamongall: you would run too if a man with a big stick is beating on you |pg||
pc|s7|nt|mamos: well predicted Peter |pg||
nt|janhamhurg: spade now|pg||
nt|arvidsson: jag tycker att det är ett svårt läge, men zonerna hade hjort att jag passat i båda fallen|pg||
nt|koksoy: down2  ??|pg||
nt|yuval10: max defense is -3|pg||
nt|yuval10: will be a big swing for Israel either way|pg||
nt|tez: hidayet abi olsa|pg||
pc|s2|nt|rnmalik: Play appears to be simple or it looks, A@H and A@D and small @C to A and KQ@C and pitch @H and let E ruff and 1@S loser.|pg||
nt|copeyj: can claim|pg||
nt|copeyj: AKJ@H pitching two @D losers|pg||
nt|copeyj: and give up @S|pg||
nt|affe82: personligen hade jag inte balanserat i ngn form. lite skräpigt.|pg||
nt|haans: mb a raise to 4@C had not been just a raise|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 2 times @s hold-up would make it interesting |pg||
nt|lestergold: now brilliancy needed|pg||
nt|jallerton: are they allowed to vary their system, Paul?|pg||
nt|Gerben42: still isnt a hopeless contract |pg||
nt|desert: East must warn his pd NOT to sacrify......|pg||
nt|james_h: are my eyes decieving me? did west run here?|pg||
nt|haans: 3nt may have been tactical|pg||
nt|gulyas: what was he afraid of then? he had the majors, he had a good hand, 3 aces, among others...|pg||
nt|haans: did not have @C honor|pg||
pc|s4|pc|s3|nt|pitiful:  looks like 9 tricks|pg||
nt|hedyg: wd|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: now actually its better than 50%|pg||
nt|Gerben42: good guessing in trumps helps|pg||
nt|yuval10: if 2@d is intermediate than E could've bid many other bids - 3@c for instance|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|vbman: rehi|pg||
nt|vbman: this will be challenging|pg||
nt|rnmalik: seems so.|pg||
nt|vbman: cash 2 cl ,play the three spot discarding hearts|pg||
nt|copeyj: the Russians stopped in 3NT next door I am told|pg||
nt|h_karluk: now declarer claims, push next board please|pg||
nt|copeyj: 8@C encouraging|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 10@C now?|pg||
nt|lestergold: does thnat show count or the club q|pg||
nt|copeyj: attitude |pg||
nt|copeyj: no need for count with doubleton on display in dummy|pg||
nt|copeyj: Tom will underlead|pg||
nt|lestergold: well there is chance now kill point as jens Auken would say|pg||
nt|copeyj: I am sure|pg||
nt|hedyg: in OR N did not open and then punished his pd for overcalling|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: or in clubs- but still i guess -1|pg||
pc|hA|nt|xenya: so far so good|pg||
nt|copeyj: yes|pg||
nt|affe82: squeeze for 11|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think that was wrong: could lead to defeat even with @d 2-2 if trumps 4-0|pg||
nt|gulyas: so, he wanted to be doubled in 4@C instead of 3?:)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|lestergold: do u fwel that south was right to run the dim a lead away from q was not too likely|pg||
nt|paulg:  Assuming the change is minor and published to the other countries|pg||
nt|Gerben42: yes|pg||
pc|h7|nt|copeyj: declarer slipped up a little|pg||
nt|copeyj: and townsend made him pay|pg||
nt|copeyj: excellent defence|pg||
nt|lestergold: well done tom u just saved 5 imps|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|arigun: asil soru su magnusson'un elinden 1@c-1@d-dbl-1@h dn sonra|pg||
pc|c3|nt|copeyj: if the danes had made 3@D would have been 7 to Denmark|pg||
nt|copeyj: as it is it will be 3 to Denmark|pg||
nt|copeyj: so I make it 4 imps saved by the defence|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4 impssaved then|pg||
nt|copeyj: but they all count and i am prepared to be corrected|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes u are right 3d 310 swing just in the 7 imp bracket|pg||
nt|lestergold: rtill was nice to see an error and its exploitation|pg||
nt|haans: i do not agree |pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|xenya: althouh i don't see why it was necessary to play spades at that point|pg||
nt|copeyj: well it wasn't nice to see an error|pg||
nt|arigun: 2@h, 2nt 3@h ne demek|pg||
nt|arigun: 2@s ve 3@d anlasilir|pg||
pc|d3|nt|paulg:  this would be a minor change, it's just all the photocopying for the NPC or coach that is the hassle|pg||
nt|haans: 2@H Flannery has changed|pg||
nt|andreasw:  a fair overcall tho|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: operator?|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: was that what happenend?|pg||
nt|vugraphzns: player had play the 10sp in place od cl|pg||
nt|desert: yes.....but 4 Dia was successful in a way ----it pushed the opponents in 4 @S and you know that this is not a very good contract.....|pg||
nt|eamongall: well strong NT and the other lad is happy to double him ...it adds up to a long @C suit and nothing else in dummy (along with the tactical possibility )|pg||
nt|james_h: East is figuring out north count for d hook|pg||
pc|d6|nt|rnmalik: wrong play:) but we have seen all the cards.:)|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: wow|pg||
pc|dT|nt|rnmalik: Difficult there is no disposal of 1 @C loser.|pg||
nt|copeyj: but it was nice to see them take advantage|pg||
nt|hedyg: indeed|pg||
nt|yuval10: then perhaps you can X 4@s|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|desert: you must|pg||
pc|dA|nt|yuval10: he'd have done so if 2@d was indeed intermediate|pg||
pc|d8|nt|lestergold: well thats what i mean simon|pg||
pc|s9|pc|d7|pg||
nt|gulyas: time to claim|pg||
nt|haans: 3nt+4@C later pure tactics|pg||
nt|haans: do not cost much|pg||
mc|10|nt|desert: it is ...see explanation :)|pg||
nt|eamongall: All I am saying is ...if our assets are a strong NT and a 4 count ...are we not happy to collect a few nifty fifties |pg||

nt|janhamhurg: no revoke just the ten under the jack|pg||

nt|oliverc: Hearts never even mentioned at the other table|pg||

mb|1H!|nt|copeyj: I would pass 3@C with the N hand i think|pg||
nt|copeyj: assuming this is weak jump|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 6@D/@H equally good.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: OR result interesting.|pg||
nt|Gerben42: not sure what 2@S shows here|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: ok it was a revoke then, the spade 10 on a club|pg||

mb|p|nt|haans: one harder to find|pg||
nt|rnmalik: yep|pg||
nt|rnmalik: what is wrong with 6@C, EW.|pg||
nt|benjy:  impossible in my view|pg||
nt|eweber: I have been told these sites work best with Internet Exlorer, some browsers refuse to show anything when you click on "playing record"|pg||
nt|haans: only slam is 6@C and 6n|pg||
nt|gulyas: I agree that S should have passed 3NT|pg||
mb|1S!|nt|mdgraham: 2@S=8+hcp, 6+@D|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Operator how can the hand be made +4, please correct or let us know how the hand was played?|pg||
nt|shevek: 1@c is either natural, or bal w/o 5M, Xfer responses|pg||
nt|xenya: not exactly an exciting set so far|pg||
nt|copeyj: yet another strong @C from Dubinin|pg||
nt|lestergold: well io ccertainly would not raise spades wioth the south hand if thats what pard bid- obviously forcing by unpassed hand|pg||
nt|haans: spades tempting|pg||
nt|haans: holy ...|pg||
nt|Walddk7: 4@S is down on best defence|pg||
nt|paulg:  Fallenius about to use Leaping Michaels?|pg||
nt|haans: we have as u in england played Multi for 40 years|pg||
nt|mamos: a heavy 1NT in my opinion with 17 and a five card suit|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Väljer man att spela på @d så löser det sig nog, |pg||
nt|affe82: tom -2 i @h.|pg||
nt|affe82: 4-0 gör det svart att hämta hem sticken.|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Nu börjar det dock se jobbigt ut att nå 5 @c då varken Ö eller V har visat @c|pg||
nt|sga1: Cold 7@d can he bid that. Shud be possible.|pg||
nt|daman: strong jump shift|pg||
nt|henryb:  how do you show an 11 winner hand?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: one feels Blackwood coming up....|pg||
nt|koksoy: 2  ve  3 nt|pg||
nt|yusufb: 1nt ye içerde süleyman 2@d araya girmiþ herhangi bir major demek|pg||
mb|p|nt|oliverc: yes|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|lestergold: i would repeat clubs|pg||
nt|copeyj: Gold-Townsend another chance to shine defensively to hold the loss to 2 imps|pg||
nt|haans: that was POKER|pg||
nt|jallerton: easy for players of this level in an uncontested auction, harder when opponents bid|pg||
nt|haans: asked and answered|pg||
nt|paulg:  I wonder how many pairs have discussed strong follow ups to this 4@d bid?|pg||
nt|jallerton: the trouble with 4@d is that it loses the @C suit.  Having passed on 1st round, I prefer to double 2@s|pg||
nt|hedyg: N needs to find a @D lead to hold this to 10 tricks|pg||
nt|henryb:  7N is better|pg||
nt|sga1: or 7NT|pg||
nt|daman: could some form of exclusion help this one?|pg||
nt|tez: rakip zonda biz beyazken dengesiz elle bulaþmak iyidir diyor herkes|pg||
mb|p|nt|shevek: 2@d is some Fit Showing (nonJump)|pg||
nt|copeyj: i think Dubinin has shown 18-20 balanced|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Heart, ruffed, diamond to the ace, heart ruff, and @SA|pg||
nt|mamos: but wont matter here |pg||
mb|2D!|nt|pelu: Operator: same problem in Board 4|pg||
nt|haans: 2@D must be a raise|pg||
nt|shevek: yes|pg||
nt|vbman: dbl?|pg||
nt|lestergold: but 3@s i agree was optimistic opposite a weak jump at green|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Pushed them to 6, now non-vul 6@D the order of the day:)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: no @H lead-ruff-@D-another @H ruff and @SA.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: sorry late.|pg||
nt|haans: never nice to x with spade void|pg||
nt|mikael_w: OPPERATOR ? are you sure this is right ?|pg||
nt|mikael_w: ser ut som ett väl hårt 1NT inkliv tycker jag :)|pg||
nt|daman: nah    he's unsheathing Easley|pg||
nt|henryb:  hard to do exclusion in partner's opened suit|pg||
nt|sga1: When simple blackwood is the right answer to reach 7N, why try exclusion here.|pg||
nt|sga1: Although exclusion coud have been right also.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I don't think 4@s by North on this auction as ERKCB is in anybody's armoury|pg||
mb|p|nt|vbman: well , u r never served if u just stand and wait|pg||
nt|copeyj: so now I am sure Gromov will look for 4-4 @H fit|pg||
nt|pitiful:  yes maybe but AK is not a good 7 points|pg||
nt|hawe45:  And pd did NOT bid 1 @S|pg||
nt|hedyg: in OR S bid 1@d and 4@H was played by E with a Q@D lead|pg||
nt|Gerben42: EW doing what's right against pairs who mix it up like NS - just play their normal game|pg||
nt|yuval10: perhaps he thought 2@s is forcing, because at the very least his hand worth 3@s|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|jallerton: never nice to play 4@h with 7@C cold|pg||
nt|hedyg: wow wd!|pg||
nt|dimi: 11 easy tricks|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: i dont like the 2 spade call- much to strong for me|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: true :)|pg||
nt|dimi: i agree Jan|pg||
nt|Gerben42: me too - but NS like to mix it up, it's their style|pg||

nt|daman: the @C suit is important for a small slam|pg||

nt|tez: en istemediðimiz þekilde sonuçlandý|pg||
mb|2S!|nt|copeyj: and play 4@H|pg||
nt|paulg:  interesting that perhaps both North and South were planning a leaping michaels bid|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes a great lead |pg||
nt|henryb:  asking to lose 2 imps|pg||
nt|yuval10: and i think i want to play game vs an opening from P, surely 1@d opening|pg||
nt|haans: no Nyström are approved|pg||
nt|haans: so|pg||
nt|eamongall: I presume EW are on some version of Carrot @C |pg||
nt|gulyas: well, with both honors offside (@HK and @CQ), the slam should fail|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: Hi Peter, agree.|pg||
nt|copeyj: looks like 5 card stayman, so 2@D showed 1+ 4cM, 2@S showed @H and no @S|pg||
nt|copeyj: is my guess|pg||
nt|mdgraham: oh wd|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Townsend is defending very well this match|pg||
nt|copeyj: they both are|pg||
nt|haans: will E double|pg||
nt|mamos: it is difficult to describe such hands if you open 1@H|pg||
nt|arvidsson: ja inte var det blygt inte|pg||
nt|koksoy: board 4 was played 3nt in  other room  ...  down...  13 for  Denmark|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @D switch important before losing the control.|pg||
nt|koksoy: defence may get 2heart  and 3 diamonds ..  seems  easy  but...|pg||
nt|rnmalik: who would play @D? |pg||
nt|koksoy: heart  now...  then  N I suppose|pg||

mb|3S!|nt|pelu: Hi Mike and Rashed|pg||

nt|mdgraham: wonder if 4NT was rkcb for diamonds - looks like it|pg||
nt|gulyas: you only have 11 tricks with only losing out one of them|pg||
nt|eamongall: Seems that way ... and other room was a @D lead scoring the @DJ|pg||
nt|haans: Ireland on Top no slam at OR|pg||
nt|gulyas: that helped|pg||
nt|eamongall: from Sweden "nope 1H was balanced 2C denied 8+zz and showed 4432 any or 4333 any|pg||

nt|janhamhurg: you can make 3 spades or even 4 with a little def mistake|pg||
nt|james_h: they are asking for 10's now|pg||
nt|haans: zz = A = 3 K = 2 Q = 1 J = who count it|pg||
nt|gulyas: we already have a double dummy play to make 6@S from the short hand|pg||
nt|james_h: its a very good slam|pg||
nt|haans: Helgemo had one 4-2 in 7@H|pg||
nt|james_h: Fredin might have done the damage to his side|pg||
nt|gulyas: ruff a @D, play off AK@S, play a @H towards the Q9|pg||
nt|gulyas: you will always reach dummy with one of those, draw trumps and still enjoy the rest|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: yes, it's down on good defence -- no entry to dummy tio cash high club in time|pg||
nt|eamongall: 5D was odd number of aces odd number of K  ... DK DA SQ but no CQ|pg||

nt|henryb:  but protecting against down a bunch if @d 9-4-0-0 around the table|pg||

nt|eamongall: that analysis from arvidsson |pg||
nt|gulyas: in Norway-Wales, which team do you think tried 7@S on these hands?:)|pg||
nt|gulyas: wrong!:) it was Wales|pg||
nt|gulyas: Norway staying in 3NT, odd enough|pg||
nt|james_h: I would have said Cyprus|pg||
nt|eamongall: I am getting informed that the arvidssonn may fail .. but its too tough for a weak declarer like myself |pg||
pc|s4|nt|ady: Russia stayed out of slam on hand 5    played 3NT|pg||

pc|c7|nt|andersk: Iceland is currently outbidding Norway(or the Norwegians outbidding themselves) On their way to 3 NT in open room|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|rmb1: That more or less playing for @HQ doubleton|pg||

nt|ady: trumps and ruff last club    then back with diamond and diamond ruff  |pg||

nt|mdgraham: but does it ask for that.....|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|copeyj: maybe it didnt|pg||
nt|copeyj: townsend didnt think it did at any rate|pg||
nt|lestergold: if 2@c was natural then it surely did ask for a club|pg||
nt|copeyj: might just say he thinks they have overbid Mike|pg||
nt|pitiful:  i know it's all the rage to open 1NT with the south hand and I understand the problems of the canape strong @c system that n-s play but I am not a fan|pg||
nt|eweber: the easiest way to reach all the runnig scores is via the official website|pg||
nt|gulyas: odd enough, EW has 2 8c M fits, but both were bid by NS first:)|pg||
pc|dA|nt|jallerton: West I mean|pg||

nt|andersk: looks like -1 here|pg||
nt|tez: ben demezdim..2 as var.belkide batýyorlar|pg||
pc|h9|nt|shevek: that is true|pg||
nt|lestergold: might have thopught that it asked him to lead his suit- this is a well known area of ambiguity ion defence you would have thought they had it sorted|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the natural lead would be a heart one would think....so perhaps double should have the lead directing overtone for clubs  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: difficult|pg||
nt|lestergold: well i expect words will be said later and im not adding any fuel to that fire|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but then, if you think the contract will go down a packet if partner simply leads his suit, it's a bit rough if you can't double because that would ask him to lead something else |pg||
nt|jfaria: even if @d wouldnt behave always 9 tricks via @c |pg||
pc|hA|nt|arvidsson: nej nu blev det 2 bet|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Oh-no - West can see, that they have an 8-card fit in @H|pg||

pc|h3|nt|Gerben42: i went through the play - wasnt that clear to guess it - but he made it :)|pg||

mc|9|nt|rodvenn: there is a new record in direct transfes from BBO. But the technical problems may not be because of BBO.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: with one of my regular partners we have the agreement here that double asks partner to lead his suit  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: although I'm not saying that it's best|pg||
nt|lestergold: it is a matter for partnership agreement |pg||
nt|lestergold: best is having an agreement and sticking to it|pg||
nt|copeyj: Slovakia 2 Italy 0|pg||
nt|mdgraham: There is also a question of ethics. You must pass or double in tempo. You can't think for ages and then pass and have partner find the right lead |pg||

nt|affe82: dubblar han inte med det da?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  So 1 hour = 7 boards|pg||
nt|koksoy: Denmark  has a big  start  30-0|pg||
nt|vugraphzns: welcome|pg||
nt|koksoy: 4  :)|pg||
nt|tez: 4 4|pg||
mb|2D|nt|rodvenn: denied that the scoring was wrong. Geo (the Norw npc) had to force the Lebanon players to go to the |pg||
nt|haans: OPERATOR Whats happening?|pg||
nt|jfaria: another easy one :)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: Germany on the board, when Iceland correctly defended with 4@S they took the push in 5@H and made it with dbl|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: starting with overruffing and play dia woul help- but decl didnt know 4-1 spades|pg||
nt|affe82: mot en slask@d|pg||
nt|rnmalik: good 4@S for NS.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 1@D=11-16, minimum of 2 cards|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: @D lean + @H to ace + @CA discarding @D+ play spades|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|rnmalik: It would be a good match, probably the match.|pg||
nt|haans: dirty 2@H|pg||
nt|pitiful:  strong @c by north|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 1@C can be 2|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Här ser det ut som att Ö/V skall försöka ra sig till 5 @d|pg||
nt|affe82: eller @c|pg||
nt|arvidsson: 5 @C går bet|pg||
nt|haans: 2@D 11-15|pg||
mb|2S|nt|shevek: no finesse in OR|pg||
nt|haans: more than 50% |pg||
mb|d!|nt|rodvenn: tounrament director, and make them go thru the boards one by one. |pg||
nt|andersk: jeez....|pg||
nt|rodvenn: in the end they accepted that it was a draw|pg||
nt|copeyj: not the luckiest of layouts here for 4@S|pg||
nt|rnmalik: coffee hand:)|pg||
nt|mamos: but a loser in each suit so only probaly an imp or so|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok to pass in E for me, even in 3rd seat|pg||
nt|hawe45:  It seems, that the swiss South in OR has guessed the @S-position, maybe 2 IMP waiting|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: second excellent board from piekarek-smirnov|pg||
nt|ludewig: they may try 4@S again|pg||
nt|arvidsson: så det hoppas vi inte på :)|pg||
nt|affe82: sant. hjärnis. :)|pg||
nt|arvidsson: 2bet i 3spader, kan vi få upp fi i 4 spader|pg||
nt|arvidsson: (tyvärr var det Johan som bjöd ;) |pg||
nt|arvidsson: Cullin|pg||
nt|arvidsson: svårt att läsa innantill|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Disciplined NOT 1 @S from Michael - good bridge|pg||
nt|yuval10: tough bid from W now...3@h isn't obious with such a bad suit|pg||
nt|yuval10: obvious even|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: 2N is roughly 21-22 for Gold/Townsend (1@C opener can include balanced 20)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i choose 2@c big there, m i alone ?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: just borrowed one HCP|pg||
nt|copeyj: Gromov spicing things up a bit with a delayed 3N overcall here :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: and 11 here|pg||
nt|koksoy: or  some  doubled scores  ??|pg||
mb|3D|nt|andersk: good job by GeO|pg||
nt|pitiful:  1N showing @c by south I assume, FG|pg||
nt|hedyg: just a bunch of quacks|pg||
nt|affe82: saja.|pg||
nt|arvidsson: men operationen lyckades|pg||
nt|arvidsson: hitta hj stölden nu Sverige :)|pg||
nt|koksoy: 25  puana   ragmen  zon  olmuyor...  bizimkiler  cok  iyi  yerde kalmýslar|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: super accept.|pg||
nt|haans: imps at right side?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  More discipline - South also|pg||
nt|hawe45:  8 tricks should be possible|pg||
nt|pikonlu: evet , 3karoda durmak cok iyi, bakalým 3nt kac batacak|pg||
mb|p|nt|vbman: dumb ol' lebensohl|pg||
nt|copeyj: although perhaps the operator misscored the last board - looks like 11 tricks only?|pg||
nt|pitiful:  2@c relay, 2@s looks like 4@h|pg||
nt|hedyg: and i dont want a @c lead!|pg||
nt|Gerben42: with passed pd, another "weak jump overcall", agree with 2@D|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 2@D over 1@C is annoying for opps|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 3@H fit jump even more so|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: and go down in 4 spade- but now 4 dia will make |pg||
nt|ludewig: 5@D makes after a Club lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzns: player in discussion|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 4@D looks like final contract now|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: no alert i guess|pg||
nt|vugraphzns: yes|pg||
nt|desert: a very difficult board for a natural system....|pg||
mb|3S|nt|rnmalik: why not the minor suit transfer, for my education:)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  hopefully W lead's a @s:)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: although it may be "general bridge logic" to bid 3@H only with fit, I still think one should alert it|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: if 3 hearts is a fit jump east might bid 3 spades|pg||
nt|arvidsson: eller det sticket får vi ändå, men snyggare|pg||
nt|mikael_w: risk för trumfutspel dock :(|pg||
nt|affe82: det kommer man väl att göra? @c ut?|pg||
nt|arvidsson: -3 om inte spelföraren hittar hj sitsen|pg||
nt|mikael_w: ohhh, det är syd som spelar :)|pg||
nt|arvidsson: tror inte riktigt att vi kommer hitta att angripa hj så tidiigt:) |pg||
nt|mikael_w: borde faktiskt vara ett ganska lätt @h utspel eller ?|pg||
nt|vugraphzns: td asking from sweden|pg||
nt|affe82: även med trumf lead hinner försvaret testa aallt för att hitta stölden, väl?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: boards like that last one swing hundreds of points - NS bid defensively (they cannot have been expecting to make 3@H) to go one down, which appears no disaster - but EW can't make ...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: vert much either   |pg||
nt|lestergold: what is 2@c?|pg||
nt|copeyj: probably their way of showing an invitational hand with 5(6)@S|pg||
nt|haans: then you are in 3nt|pg||
nt|haans: acceptance from W|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  lucky guys - today is a "short" day - 1 or 2 matches only|pg||
nt|eweber: I think 1NT is just and relay without 4M|pg||
nt|andreasw:  wow did N really pas?|pg||
nt|hedyg: voila! he has kept them out of game?|pg||
nt|hedyg: sure, where should he go? pd is balancing|pg||

nt|hedyg: could be weak, like 9-10 hcps|pg||

nt|hawe45:  2 NT will go down, South has NO reason to guess the @S-position|pg||
nt|james_h: pound for pound on this board|pg||
nt|eamongall: portugal play greece in final round while Ireland Austria go head to head ... its possible portugal will have it in their own hands to lose |pg||
pc|cA|nt|vbman: so its 5 now|pg||
nt|affe82: det här läsandet var svart. bäst att vara tyst lite. :)|pg||
nt|koksoy: unlucky  for  weak  nt  lovers  :)|pg||
nt|oliverc: but if 3@H implies at least a decent Spade tolerance, maybe easy enough for East|pg||
nt|oliverc: to find 3@S. 3@H looks makeable, though|pg||
pc|c6|nt|xenya: back to partscores|pg||

nt|paulg:  i wonder if Gold is playing 2@h as a good weak two and 2@d multi as a weak weak two in third seat|pg||
pc|c4|nt|christinas: 2@c is stayman with the intention of follow up with 2! which is invitational|pg||
nt|christinas: @s|pg||
nt|lestergold: well flat thankfully for england dont think they can afford any more adverse swings|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4@s is not a great contract tho especially non vul-|pg||
nt|lestergold: neeeds 2 out of three fimnesses and a 2/1 spade break more or less|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|rodvenn: the problem is if dummy is forced |pg||
nt|rodvenn: before the spades is established|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  after so many " @s " bids, will W lead this suit?|pg||
nt|mamos: it's amazing how little help so many CCs are|pg||

nt|hawe45:  @S 8 is the correct switch now|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@C is described as NF Stayman, so 3@C may be F Stayman - CC not really clear|pg||

nt|andyv:  with 4 trump S probably would have preferred a forcing game rather than lead a @d but neither black suit is attractive (although @c lead seems to work well)|pg||
nt|jallerton: Yes, 4@s looks aggressive, although perhaps East would not bid 2@s with 3334 playing 4-card majors |pg||

nt|arvidsson: för att inte ge fi chansen att hitta sin färg|pg||
nt|james_h: I dont know the subtlties between opening 1@d here and them opening 2@c|pg||
mb|2N|nt|mdgraham: lots of flaws - singleton black honours, the four hearts....but still tempting|pg||
nt|andyv:  this auction it's tempting for Gromov to bid 3N|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 2 level @s or N fine there|pg||
nt|lestergold: looks like an overboard hand for e/w|pg||
nt|copeyj: I would expect the twins to end in game next door (they play 14-16 NT in this position)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: disciplined partnerships mahy handle it|pg||
nt|lestergold: combined 25 AND NO PLAY FOR 3n|pg||
nt|h_karluk: *may|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: Non Ace@C lead makes 4@S.|pg||
nt|copeyj: combined 24 i think mike|pg||
nt|copeyj: 17 opp 7 isnt it?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 24 i think|pg||
nt|rmb1: Not sure why 1@S alerted.  Card suggests 1@S is nat, <GF|pg||
nt|pitiful:  but a low @c switch initially .....|pg||
nt|hawe45:  East has bad values, no thinking about a slam, not at all|pg||
mb|3N|nt|lestergold: well tyhen russians have been conservative at the right time cant see the twins being as conservative|pg||
nt|haans: what would 2nt overcall have meant|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @C hook correct and the contract home.|pg||
nt|jallerton: might yet get to 7 after than majestic leap to game|pg||
nt|haans: 6 is enough|pg||
nt|jallerton: East'd double is usually 13-15 balanced|pg||
nt|paulg:  Gold is not passing this, just considering best way forward|pg||
nt|jallerton: West has bid 4@s opposite that|pg||
nt|affe82: med andra hö hade jag haft förstaels för 3. (även över 2@d)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Better to get 420|pg||
mb|p|nt|shevek: I wonder why south didn't cue @ss|pg||
nt|shevek: hearts|pg||
nt|haans: 5-6?|pg||
nt|haans: what did 21Hx show?|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: wont make with a normal dia lead, unless you guess the spade suit|pg||
nt|arvidsson: känsligt kontrakt för ÖV 9 stick kommer det troligen att sluta med (även om försvaret kan beta)|pg||
nt|affe82: ser ut som att detta gar att pilla hem.|pg||
nt|affe82: nja. han kan väl alltid ga hem om han stjäl högt och fiskar med @dT  pa vägen tillbaks?|pg||
nt|arvidsson: spader A sedan mera spader för att stjäla högt och maska ? |pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: sorry only 24|pg||
nt|eweber: y, there you are right, but who would seeing a doubleton in dummy and the chance to overruff in @s?|pg||
nt|henryb:  and less likely by W than by E, as the @h lead is certain|pg||
nt|nyg8:  if the lead is not a H then make he will make 6S|pg||
mb|p|nt|shevek: 3@d should set the trumps|pg||
nt|copeyj: now here is a hand i specialise in|pg||
nt|copeyj: playing in 3-3 fits|pg||
nt|eweber: 2@c in the German system askes for 4@h|pg||
nt|mdgraham: interesting style - no 4@H cue by West|pg||
nt|haans: missed acceptable slam|pg||
pc|d2|nt|pelu: No in practical bridge there are 2 C-losers|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i guess Dubinin draw the big picture and respected captaincy|pg||
nt|paulg:  second double would normally be a strongish takeout|pg||
nt|pitiful:  2@d shows a doubleton @h?|pg||
nt|eweber: 2@d say no|pg||
nt|ludewig: 4@S needs to play Spades for no losers|pg||
nt|affe82: enligt den tidigare diskussionen hade jag dock inte skämtsw för att bjuda 3@s över 3@d. men ni övriga kanske inte haller med?|pg||
nt|arvidsson: nej bjuder man 2 spader har man gjort sitt, tycker man får välja i första varvet|pg||
nt|arvidsson: då jag hade bjudit 3 spader (som troligen är ett rätt dåligt bud)|pg||
nt|arvidsson: troligen kommer Uppmark att spela kl från bordet|pg||
nt|mikael_w: svårt tycker jag, men jag hade aBSOLUT NÖJT MIG MED 2 @S FÖRSTA GÅNGEN, SEDAN OM MAN BJUDER 3 OCKSÅ SÅ BÖRJAR DET JU LUKTA LITE DUBBLINGSFARA NÄR DET SITTER DÅLIGT|pg||
nt|james_h: operator, tell them to mark in 490, and move on|pg||
nt|haans: @CT made it good|pg||
pc|dA|nt|shevek: they seem to get there anyway|pg||
nt|xenya: slam rates to go down though -- on the surface|pg||
nt|shevek: on a @c lead declarer has to guess @ss|pg||
nt|haans: 5@c AND WAIT|pg||
nt|rodvenn: Norge slapp unna en katastrofe i det andre rommet.Boye doblet 4 hj og islendingene rettet til 4sp|pg||
nt|rodvenn: fortsatt spill 8|pg||
nt|rmb1: 1@S could be 3 @S|pg||

pc|d3|nt|paulg:  the redouble said 'bid your suit'|pg||
nt|jallerton: Oh sorry I am asleep|pg||
nt|haans: ok|pg||

nt|shevek: and wait|pg||
nt|shevek: ok by me, I'm checking emails....|pg||
nt|haans: the more he waits lesss option for S to bid slam|pg||
nt|xenya: declarer will play it carefully and will find out E is likely to have more spades than W, so he will play E for the Queen |pg||
nt|shevek: evil thought Vladimir|pg||
nt|xenya: alas...|pg||
nt|shevek: and wait....|pg||

nt|paulg:  is this going to be a match of two halves?|pg||
nt|affe82: njet|pg||
nt|arvidsson: att johan duckade ytterligare 1 spader var om N även hade kl A dvs AK och hj längden|pg||
nt|arvidsson: nej kontraktet gick troligen 1 bet|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Ytterligare en riktigt rolig hand kommer här|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Still better with 420, which will be the score in the other room|pg||
nt|henryb:  and lose @d ruff???|pg||
nt|nyg8:  5D, 4S, 1H, 1C, and H ruff|pg||
nt|nyg8:  ok, lets say C lead then|pg||
nt|henryb:  Club gives @c finesse. yes would make then|pg||
nt|desert: very unlucky board for the german NS pair....|pg||
nt|oliverc: going to be difficult for the Israelis to avoid duplicating the result, though|pg||
nt|desert: But i guess they will play slam in this room too......|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|rnmalik: Sorry-connection problem.|pg||
nt|haans: :) |pg||
nt|janhamhurg: so you compare kx onside with 10x offside- thats about 50 50|pg||
nt|oliverc: well that might slow things down, but I doubt it|pg||
nt|oliverc: eagle-eyed spec points out that 6@C making by West|pg||
nt|haans: operator had a talk?|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: what would you do with the N hand|pg||
nt|oliverc: so perhaps 6@HX-1 should be viewed as a good sac :)|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|pelu: 1NT 15-17 (vuln)|pg||
nt|andyv:  most practical bid seems to be 3N (if not conventional)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: you suspect that South is about to wheel out some System |pg||
nt|pelu: many would just bid 3NT now - u can also tranfer to 3@C and see partners reaction|pg||
nt|rnmalik: another doomed contract.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: NS can make 5@H alright.|pg||
nt|haans: 6@H odds off|pg||
nt|rnmalik: no action boards:)|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: mal sehen---|pg||
nt|oliverc: At the 6-level already and North hasn't even mentioned a suit yet :)|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: sorry|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: i think England will open 1NT next door with the W hand (14-16) then it is unclear where the auction will go |pg||
nt|ady: west may retreat|pg||
nt|copeyj: I wld just bid 1@S but know people who would double|pg||
nt|dimi: NS will try 3nt on this one|pg||
mb|1S!|nt|haans: in my book that is natural|pg||
nt|ludewig: try and make|pg||
nt|arvidsson: ok kanske var för att få S att lägga ner kl A :)|pg||
nt|koksoy: this  not a  slemish  set|pg||
nt|mdgraham: very thin double|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: 3 nt ye parkederiz|pg||
mb|2H!|nt|lestergold: rescue transfer to hearts i assume|pg||
nt|haans: no 2 suiter|pg||
nt|hedyg: leaddirecting?|pg||
nt|Gerben42: but the essential point is that you dont knwo your @S goal without knowing if you lose @HK|pg||
nt|arvidsson: får många kloka tips om att N måste ha några HP för sin budgivning|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Ser ut som att 6 @h är ett bra kontrakt, men det kanske kan finnas fällor i det också|pg||
nt|hawe45:  A fair slam here - good chances with @H 3-2|pg||
mb|p|nt|shevek: 1NT=12-14|pg||
nt|xenya: i think it's a very good slam -- almost cold on a non-club lead and 50+% on a club lead|pg||
nt|copeyj: X penalties from Gold - and surely Dubinin will run - i suspect xx shows a 5 card suit somewhere now let's see where they end up|pg||
nt|h_karluk: interesting points : 3 "Jan" at the table (SWN) and Gunther PURKARTHOFER still with Fucik, last year their partners were Arno  Lindermann and Christoph Puersil|pg||
nt|haans: 2@S raise|pg||
mb|4S|nt|mdgraham: the day when 1NT-3NT is conventional is the day I give up bridge - that's a promise|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Welcome to Paul Orth|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@d is wow|pg||
nt|koksoy: I believe  that;  some  sets  are  slemish.. some  are  dull|pg||
nt|rnmalik: EW can make 4@S, placement of cards very friendly.|pg||
nt|henryb:  even 3@h is one down|pg||
nt|nyg8:  y|pg||
nt|koksoy: öyle  gözüküyor..|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  N shouldn't take @c hook|pg||
nt|pelu: why not?|pg||
nt|haans: 2@H raise|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  Kxx in E hand|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Brave bid.|pg||
nt|pauleger: hello|pg||
nt|rnmalik: hello and welcome.|pg||
nt|pauleger: good choices by Kirmse after the very effective 2@s opener|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that should be that|pg||
nt|haans: 48 imps on errors|pg||
nt|hawe45:  The West-hand is fair for a 1 @H-overcall|pg||
nt|andreasw:  so is my grade in german:)|pg||
nt|mikael_w: kommer aldrig gå att få stopp på S med den handen och partnern hoppar|pg||
mb|p|nt|jfaria: E decides for a GF |pg||
nt|h_karluk: @h lead and history|pg||
nt|jallerton: 1@d 4+@h, 1@h usually 11-14 balanced without 4 hearts|pg||
nt|hawe45:  North has maximum for ALL his bids here|pg||
nt|hedyg: more than max|pg||
pc|h3|nt|pelu: correct! u are :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: gold's second doubole musrt be for takeout|pg||
nt|copeyj: normal @C lead for Townsend I would say - and it looks like this is makeable to me|pg||
nt|lestergold: not supisingly townsend passes but this is a better spot than 2h could scramble quite  few tricks here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no, brave 3@h|pg||
nt|dimi: no road to fail|pg||
nt|mikael_w: 6 @h går nog alltid hen även om det sitter dåligt|pg||
nt|affe82: daligt?|pg||
nt|arvidsson: ja 6@H om det bjuds kommer att gå hem, därför hoppas vi på att de bjuder 6nt :)|pg||
nt|mikael_w: med @d utspel, så kan speföraren ta utspetel och spela @h, men duckar V då och S spelar en @h till så är j|pg||
nt|arvidsson: ruter sitter dåligt, spadern sitter sjukt bra|pg||
nt|mikael_w: går det nog bet om V tar och fortsätter med @h|pg||
nt|arvidsson: nej spader J sitter 3:e|pg||
pc|h5|nt|haans: but clubs most likely lead|pg||
nt|shevek: yes, played by north better (less likely @c lead)|pg||
nt|copeyj: i think it's normal to bid 3@H|pg||
nt|mamos: The women's championship is still very close   -- about half the field still in touch with the leaders|pg||
nt|rnmalik: E stepped in to rescue NS.|pg||
nt|tez: @s ataktan sonra egale|pg||
pc|hA|nt|andersk: probably 7 tricks|pg||
nt|copeyj: has a little something, 5th @H and no @S wastage opposite presumed shortage|pg||
nt|lestergold: well reckons his q@d working so i think he can at this colour|pg||
nt|jfaria: a @h lead will be devastating|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 1o tricks|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: but germany is far behind now in the match, and i woudnt call that unlucky|pg||
nt|arvidsson: varav det alltid står|pg||
nt|mikael_w: du har bara 3 sak, du kanske sakar en @d och slår en @s-mask|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Singel @d ut så kommer det ofta att gå bet|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|rnmalik: But this may not make-imo 4@S x is to play.|pg||
nt|james_h: this is a tough conctract|pg||
nt|james_h: for declarer|pg||
pc|d6|nt|arvidsson: varför då?|pg||
nt|mikael_w: ja hur hade du spelat efter @d ut ?|pg||
nt|arvidsson: tror inte han kommer att lägga ner några ruter, men visst det kan hända|pg||
nt|mikael_w: det handlar inte om att lägga ner, hur spelar ni efter @d ut ?|pg||
nt|arvidsson: jag stväl på handen spelar hj Q|pg||
nt|affe82: duck. @h. be till gud.|pg||
nt|arvidsson: stjäl |pg||
nt|arvidsson: sedan är det rulltårta :)|pg||
nt|mikael_w: nej det är det inte|pg||
nt|arvidsson: jo det är det 2 ingångar @H K samt @S Q kan stjäla upp rutern om jag vill då|pg||
nt|arvidsson: men som sagt sitter trumfen 4-1 kan det bli jobbigt|pg||
pc|dA|nt|pauleger: this contract can be set after simply playing 2 rounds of @h|pg||
nt|mdgraham: close though. Pard doesn't guarantee four hearts|pg||
nt|lestergold: but does gurantee 3|pg||
nt|copeyj: very likely to have short @S and thus 3@H|pg||
nt|lestergold: if not wopuld have much stronger hand|pg||
nt|haans: @DJ standard for this pair|pg||
nt|paulg:  on the card?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No trump-lead this time, Michael|pg||
nt|tez: tabii bilimsel @d ataðýda var..ben @s atak ederdim|pg||
pc|dT|nt|pelu: I owe u 1, Andy|pg||
nt|rodvenn: maybe good for norway as it may be difficult to stop in 2 @h|pg||
nt|rodvenn: for NS|pg||
nt|haans: nope mot that standard|pg||
nt|haans: not|pg||
nt|mikael_w: stjäla upp @d ? skojar du?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  On a @D-lead, you might play a @H to the 10|pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and now a @s switch|pg||
nt|jfaria: Paulissen would thank u for the info :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Gert supposed to find it, drums beating|pg||
nt|haans: tough for all|pg||
pc|dK|nt|rmb1: 1NT(X)Pass = forcing to redouble|pg||
nt|arvidsson: jag kan stjäla upp rutern om jag villl, hade jag gjort det ja|pg||
nt|nyg8:  bbad D|pg||
pc|s5|nt|paulg:  it's not a nice hand to lead from, and you don't want diamonds returned, so it is a reasonable try|pg||
nt|haans: i do not like players that lead to be copied in papers|pg||
nt|arvidsson: lite beroende på vad som händer tidigare när jag spelar hj J |pg||
pc|d5|nt|rodvenn: but only 5 losers for East|pg||
nt|affe82: riskerna är väl: @h A kan ge @d stöld. men mest 4-1 i trumf. annars kan man enligt arvidssons linje dra trumf och ruffa 2@d|pg||
nt|arvidsson: duckar de och jag spelar hj mot K |pg||
nt|mikael_w: så i stick 2 spelar du !q och efter duck även @h J då. men då vet jag inte om du spelat med oddsen|pg||
pc|d9|pg||
nt|jfaria: anything works, except @h |pg||
nt|h_karluk: however declarer still far far away to bring it home|pg||
nt|jfaria: @d dont behave|pg||
nt|jfaria: he will need @s|pg||
nt|h_karluk: say behaved|pg||
nt|mamos: dummy is short of entries here|pg||
nt|pitiful:  a double dummy @h 10 lead was the only chance|pg||
nt|mamos: but now declarer is well in control|pg||
nt|james_h: its easier defend against a natural sys|pg||
pc|s7|pc|s3|nt|copeyj: Gold can make this if he reads it perfectly, and England in 2@S next door (likely to make)|pg||
nt|copeyj: so some chance for a dbl partscore swing|pg||
nt|arvidsson: jag spelar en liten hj mot K i stick 3, |pg||
nt|mikael_w: ja, men det är oerhört lätt när man ser alla kort, men jag kan nog lova att du inte spelar brickan på bästa sätt om du spelar så|pg||
pc|s4|nt|mdgraham: I knew it. One of my partners wants to play 1NT-3NT as a minor suit slam try :) |pg||
nt|pelu: the danger for N is to lose to a @S-H and then @S back and @D = 5 losers - no problem with both @S H in East|pg||
nt|jfaria: ther it goes|pg||
nt|haans: 2nd opinion: beboeloek: heart lead maybe better on this hand|pg||
nt|haans: my man :)|pg||
nt|arvidsson: jag tror att det är rätt spelföring Micke|pg||
pc|s9|pg||
nt|andyv:  as a spec also pointed out Kxx in W hand also a good reason not take finesse|pg||
nt|henryb:  unless the defense gives away the contract, of course|pg||
nt|mccormac: @cAQ|pg||
nt|mccormac: sry private|pg||
nt|james_h: many Sweeds differ on making/not making|pg||
nt|james_h: "he cannot risk south have club, so AQ not in the picture I think"|pg||
pc|cA|nt|rnmalik: nothing does. such a hand.|pg||
nt|koksoy: Denmark  is increasing  pressure  for th 9th chair|pg||
nt|nyg8:  why play C when S can be risky|pg||
nt|nyg8:  S is safe- club is riksy|pg||
pc|c2|nt|xenya: this, however, is a coffee hand -- which reminds me... brb|pg||
nt|lestergold: now dim club dim and what does north do|pg||
nt|copeyj: can play a number of lines now|pg||
nt|lestergold: al defence can come to now surely are two trump tricks one way or the other|pg||
nt|koksoy: 40-0|pg||
nt|henryb:  either black suit concedes the contract: only @hA and a @h (probably) leads to defeat|pg||
nt|nyg8:  After aH and H can make contract by wining in dummy and play small S.|pg||
nt|daman: all roads lead to +140|pg||
pc|c5|nt|rodvenn: direct losers|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Really bad luck, with this lead, declarer only needs trumps 3-2 and @s-suit fair|pg||
pc|cT|pg||

nt|arvidsson: att spela QJ i hj, sitter hj 3-2 är det matte hemma|pg||
nt|henryb:  yes, but unlikely to make that play|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|h_karluk: i don't know, 2@c fine but..whatever|pg||

nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: 7 is it|pg||
nt|copeyj: I even laid the addition out for u Mike :)|pg||
nt|eweber: following links from the official result page you can reach that one to see what is going on on board 12 at the other tables|pg||
nt|andreasw:  another 7 imp's gained this match is almost over|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Not even Ottmar Hitzfeld would bid 1 @D as West|pg||
nt|andreasw:  slam time|pg||
nt|dimi: hopefully the German soccer team will perform slightly better in a few hours :)|pg||
nt|arvidsson: men intresserad att höra vad som är med oddsen ? |pg||
nt|arvidsson: med ruterutspel?|pg||
nt|mikael_w: men då går du bet när @d uppför sig och @h sitter 4-1|pg||
nt|henryb:  since the contract would be cold on a finesse through the opening bidder|pg||
nt|daman: 4@H game now for NS|pg||
nt|nyg8:  true, but it is an interesting option that rarely happens|pg||
nt|tez: 7@s oluyor ..koz as ruaya vermesek|pg||
mb|p|mb|1C|nt|pitiful:  strong @c|pg||
nt|eweber: right, but Sabine and Dany can be slow when interesting hands come up|pg||
nt|hedyg: this is not a 3@h opening|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Yes - but difficult after 1 @H opening by East|pg||
nt|hawe45:  ItÂ´s 1 @H - no more, no less|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  10 : Iceland made 11 tricks in @H|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: they are lucky - they dont play vs iceland|pg||
nt|Gerben42: Germany really needs some good boards if they want at least to be in 2 digits|pg||
nt|ludewig: and another slammish hand|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: if i had 1 bid only it would be 6 clubs:)|pg||
nt|arvidsson: ja absoult, men ruter ut talar väl mer för att rutern sitter snett än att hj gör det ?|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Jag säger inte att jag har facit, bara att jag tror att det kan gå bet med @d utspel om man väljer fel spelsätt|pg||
nt|affe82: eller bada.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Quite normal 3 NT here|pg||
nt|koksoy: this  board could be punishment for Denmark  but Estonia missed a  chance for 5 or 8 hundred|pg||
mb|2C|nt|h_karluk: both vul and weak NT in action|pg||
nt|lestergold: 15 the deficit and 8 boards to go so eng still has chacne to reverse this|pg||
mb|2S|nt|andyv:  S hand looks like a 1N opener|pg||
nt|lestergold: deficit|pg||
nt|jfaria: those hands are tricky, 8 hc points and a void... facing 1nt|pg||
nt|dimi: 6@h cannot be beaten|pg||
nt|Gerben42: Elinescu wont like 2@S behind his @SK|pg||
nt|henryb:  and might make even if the @s is off if the same player has 4@s and 3@c|pg||
nt|haans: overcall after 1@C rare today|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: will this end in 2@SX e/w? that would not be pleasant for them|pg||
nt|jallerton: the Sweded missed a decent game in the other room|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Ouf - TOO strong for 1 NT|pg||
mb|3S|nt|pelu: Operator - I know it is diff - but dont claim 10 tricks when opp has taken 4 tricks, pl :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: But you had given up:)|pg||
nt|shevek: bd 10 was not passed in as we thought|pg||
nt|haans: SW other side of screen|pg||
nt|mamos: all these players have lots of medals and championships to their names|pg||
nt|andreasw:  this is he's fault|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Welcome |pg||
nt|janhamhurg: but 6 club is better, but since 2 keycard are missing 6 isnt an option i thk|pg||
nt|arvidsson: väldigt få brickor som är självklara, oftast brukar man finna någon dålig variant att spela på, men finns en anledning varför jag inte spelar utan sitter här och kommenterar|pg||
nt|affe82: med en gynsam @s sits. var väl även linjen med vinst(kasta @c) liten hj. kassaskap? kan fa en giss om maska med @h8 när en hypotetisk E vinner @h k med A..|pg||
nt|koksoy: you  know  1100  is  an  emergency  number in  every  country  so  I told about  800  :)|pg||
nt|nyg8:  and there were some clues as if N hehlp SK, HA, and AK of D he would open 1N|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: duly noted|pg||
nt|jallerton: as have the English|pg||
mb|4S|nt|pauleger: i think its some sort of kokish here|pg||
nt|haans: both :)|pg||
nt|pitiful:  they only have 1 schedule match in open today so they replay this pm|pg||
nt|pitiful:  sorry private|pg||
nt|eweber: this is very true, we are watching one of the strongest matches of the whole women tournament|pg||
nt|hawe45:  4 @H is lay-down|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 4 sp is -1 only|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: or - 2 if a ruff comes|pg||
nt|Gerben42: running scores: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/10Ostend/Results.htm|pg||
nt|arvidsson: men vi glömmer den brickan och spanar på denna intressanta giv|pg||
nt|arvidsson: trots gynsam sit ser 3nt väldigt skakigt ut|pg||
nt|mikael_w: japp :) håller med Arvidsson :) BRB, rökpause|pg||
nt|affe82: westerlund bör som jag lära sig att sitta pa verandan. da behöver man inte ga ifran oavsett begär.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: pass must be forcing byh west i assume|pg||
nt|ady: this time e/w are in difficulties|pg||
nt|copeyj: assume this shows @D and a major|pg||
nt|jfaria: E hand must be limited, otherwise not easy to stop at 2 level|pg||
nt|paulg:  i suppose if you are going to miss the game, then stopping at the one level is optimal|pg||
nt|andreasw:  should be 9 trick's unleass he guess the @h Q|pg||
nt|andreasw:  unless|pg||
nt|dimi: hello Hans and Specs|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: i expect similar result by OR|pg||
nt|copeyj: going to get away with it i think - townsend cld pass and collect a nice penalty but not so easy not to bid his 5 card @h suit here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: bet 1NT shows spades|pg||
nt|haans: hard to like @DK|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: sorry always -2|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: bidding clubs 3 times is a miracle to me- sorry|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Magnus Eriksson hade en intressant sak från förra brickan också, stjäl ni utspelet och sedan spelar trumf och sedan stjäl upp @d så måste ni stjäla högt, och då får vär V ett ...|pg||
nt|mikael_w: trumfspel?|pg||
nt|mikael_w: BRB|pg||
nt|koksoy: 10  tricks|pg||
nt|henryb:  they play 14+ 1NT?|pg||
nt|tez: bizimkiler kaðýdýn hakkýný vermek için 5 ede gelseler sorun yok|pg||
nt|koksoy: macýn  tansiyonu  düstü..|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  not sure why the 2@h raise|pg||
nt|jfaria: told it showed 11-13 ty kib :)|pg||
nt|nyg8:  and the Q or J of clubs|pg||
pc|c2|nt|pelu: 1@C = 12-14 or 18-19 Ball., or natural @C|pg||
nt|shevek: guess south opened 1NT and played there|pg||
nt|jallerton: at least the Swedes tried to get to game|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  my team has its debuit here, but our first victory was vs.England - 16 to 14 - sensation for us|pg||
nt|ludewig: South shows some club support, he did not bid 4@H immediately|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: a kibitz says pass over 4 spade would have been forcing- im not so sure about that|pg||
nt|henryb:  if 15-17, then North could have no club honor|pg||
nt|henryb:  or an unbalanced hand|pg||
nt|nyg8:  that was my point - am jsut saying there were some clues the S had SK|pg||
nt|henryb:  Perverse Flannery opener|pg||
nt|henryb:  5=4 in majors rather than 4=5|pg||
nt|henryb:  presumably they canape, and reverses show extras|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 5+@S, 4+@h, 8-14 hcp. Quite a wide range|pg||
nt|nyg8:  that sounds right. E has now tough decision|pg||
nt|nyg8:  going up with the A will set up 2C tricks for D discard|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3NT showed 5422 maximum|pg||
nt|haans: in the good old days you had automatic overcalls|pg||
pc|cA|nt|rnmalik: ace less 12. |pg||
nt|hawe45:  He would open 1 NT also wit a 4-card @D - and here he has two more tricks|pg||
nt|rnmalik: so found the fit, afterx.|pg||
pc|c4|nt|shevek: unsuccessfully|pg||
nt|pauleger: you will make 4@s although you have 3 loosers in @h and @c, because you wont finesse against the dangerous opponent|pg||
nt|copeyj: dubinin made a good decision on this deal to show a 2 suiter|pg||
nt|ady: looks like n/s will take their vuln game|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3N looks a better spot than 4H|pg||
nt|h_karluk: with 2 hcp?|pg||
nt|arvidsson: hm ett bra kontrakt landade de i, vågar vi hoppas på spader ut och sedan hj till A och mera hj ? så det blir en snabb resa tillö hemgång|pg||
nt|affe82: visst @h A som det sitter. det blir jobbigt om w startade med 9xxx och E med Asingel.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Open 1 @D and jump to 2 NT|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Hello|pg||
nt|henryb:  and ducking might lose the @cA if declarer has @dKQx|pg||
pc|c7|pg||
nt|oliverc: layout favouring NS here. going to be effectively forced into the winning line|pg||
pc|s2|nt|shevek: the cards are not very friendly here|pg||
nt|haans: 2@S must have been spades + clubs Häxan in sweden |pg||
nt|copeyj: yes although both probably make|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6 on a non club lead|pg||
nt|mamos: think this is coffee hand :)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 5@CX+1 is more than slam|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 1400 vs 1370|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: that scores well no sos on level 5:)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: XX I mean|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 5@CXX+1 , without redouble slam is more|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: is north thinking? if he bids i leave:)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: north and east are on 1 side - operator enters two bids at the time|pg||
nt|ludewig: the operator puts in bids for N and E at the same time, so East is thinking I think|pg||
nt|dimi: E will not feel comfortable|pg||
nt|Gerben42: East just showed support in an auction in which opps are strong |pg||
nt|vugraphzns: N is thinking|pg||
nt|nyg8:  also true. Tough guess|pg||
pc|s5|nt|arvidsson: ska fi spela massa trumf på oss|pg||
nt|koksoy: I prefer  second  double  from  S|pg||
nt|tez: bende sýkýntýdan saçmalýyorum..yorum yapacak el yok|pg||
pc|sK|nt|hawe45:  Dear collegue - 4 @H lay-down = 10 tricks, they will regret, that they didÂ´nr RD|pg||
nt|Gerben42: woww|pg||
nt|arvidsson: som det sitter, men hoppas på att de attackerar hj s¨vi går hem|pg||
nt|arvidsson: bra trumfvända från S|pg||
nt|nyg8:  so it seems that 5 is cold|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
nt|pauleger: with @hs behaving this will make easily|pg||
nt|haans: W has on other bid yes|pg||
nt|paulg:  embarrassing to make eleven tricks in a one-level contract|pg||
nt|haans: have we not all been there?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  1130 against possible 1370|pg||
nt|Gerben42: might be the start of a German comeback?|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: its not that easy- we will see|pg||
pc|s3|nt|lestergold: yeh hearts is hard work tho shouldmake|pg||
nt|haans: even today|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Oh-oh - only 600...|pg||
pc|s6|nt|h_karluk: cake and walk|pg||
nt|copeyj: not that hard - especially if that lead reveals that KQ@D both with E (likely on auction anyway)|pg||
nt|lestergold: well the dim position is fortunate |pg||
nt|rmb1: What was 3D(X)P - attempt to right-side 3NT?|pg||
nt|arvidsson: men fortfarande hemma (då inget kan hota en stöld)|pg||
pc|s9|nt|rnmalik: May take the right view in @S as well.|pg||
nt|lestergold: lose 2h and a dim|pg||
nt|hawe45:  So "WE" get 11 IMP|pg||
nt|Gerben42: on this lead can make all tricks even... 1800|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: we see 13 tricks, but imagine cl 3-1 and king of hearts offside|pg||
pc|c8|pg||
pc|sA|nt|h_karluk: i think after X NT was out of issue sir|pg||
nt|lestergold: brb|pg||
pc|c9|nt|pelu: better bid 1. time - u know that u never will have 1@H when u have fit - sp better take space|pg||
pc|s8|nt|andyv:  with 4-3-3-3 14hcp + 2 10s, S hand just felt like 1N opener esp. over a passed pd.|pg||
nt|dimi: One swallow does not make a summer ...|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: i doubt that that is an english saying----|pg||
nt|oliverc: ...or not, as the case may be|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|jfaria: in any case (maybe 14) easy for W to pass...|pg||
nt|Gerben42: update on board  10 - apparently the table result was 5@S making, but score adjusted by director to 5@H-1 ; Germany can appeal until 30 minutes after end of match|pg||
nt|Gerben42: reason for adjustment was a break in tempo (BIT) from Elinescu|pg||
pc|c5|nt|eweber: for those interested in CCs and other stuff: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/Events/ebl/2010ostend/default.asp |pg||
nt|james_h: it is not like Derek (W in the other room) to floor the last 4@s|pg||
pc|cK|nt|rnmalik: nicely bid and with @S 3/3 makes.|pg||
pc|c3|pc|h6|pg||
nt|haans: You may called it Gazzilli in Sweden we call it Häxan|pg||
nt|haans: 2@C becaused 2@C would have been relay|pg||
nt|xenya: down 1 if Fallenius gets @Cs right -- more if he doesn't|pg||

nt|shevek: back to part scores....|pg||
nt|haans: or not|pg||
nt|rodvenn: interesting hand|pg||
nt|rodvenn: 6 @d is rasonable contract|pg||
nt|andersk: 3 @S or 4@S overcall|pg||
nt|rodvenn: reasonable|pg||
nt|rodvenn: but needs 2 finesses|pg||
nt|rodvenn: if eager bidding, everybody may bid too high for safety|pg||
nt|andersk: 6@D can be set with a @C ruff|pg||
nt|rodvenn: and then norway must find club ruff against 6 @d|pg||
nt|rodvenn: but nomrla opening is 1@d with East|pg||
nt|rodvenn: then 2 of @s lead will be lavinthal for club ruff|pg||
nt|pauleger: so he took the best line not knowing @hs behave|pg||
nt|pauleger: 6NT here|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Sorry for miscounting, 1130 was never in question, but 930 by playing @C earlier|pg||
nt|nyg8:  i the SA and then double finess in H is a better play|pg||
nt|nyg8:  i would havr played the SA and then double finessed H|pg||
nt|vugraphzns: toilet break for 3 players|pg||
nt|nyg8:  3N will be bid but not make if N unblocks the cQ and does not lead S|pg||
nt|nyg8:  this is an interesting hand. One assumes that W will be declare|pg||
nt|henryb:  bye all. Work calls|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: 3nt ?|pg||
nt|rodvenn: yes. here we go!|pg||
nt|andersk: I have a feeling that many NS will make 4 @S|pg||
nt|rodvenn: how much shd South bid?|pg||
nt|eweber: looking back to board 6 and 8, the two swings, in both cases the English were one of two teams in the whole women tournament to earn these imps, congratulations!|pg||
nt|oliverc: You're az tempo behind and so have to play for QX@C to get an entry to Dummy to|pg||
nt|oliverc: hook the Diamonds|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: yet another big @C for Dubinin - amazing number in one set|pg||
nt|jallerton: yes, some of us have made +5 too!|pg||
nt|andreasw:  another slam|pg||
nt|affe82: claimade han inte 10?|pg||
nt|nyg8:  on a passived D lead and unblock of cQ, S gains an entry in C and they can take 4S and a C|pg||
mb|1C!|nt|haans: time to bid Fredin|pg||
nt|jallerton: 3@s should show a reasonable hand here as borderline hands can pass and bid 3@s on next round|pg||
nt|jallerton: Justin Hackett chose 3@s after same start to auction|pg||
nt|haans: he have cards for 3@S|pg||
nt|jallerton: perhaps he is considering 2NT|pg||
nt|haans: pass now bid 3@S later no no no|pg||
nt|paulg:  the hand is not so great, three small diamonds, heart poorly placed ... 3@s looks normal|pg||
nt|pitiful:  2@d @s and another|pg||
nt|mamos: 10-12|pg||
nt|hedyg: multi 2@d|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 1@C can be 2|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Aj då. nu ser vi att 6 @h gick en bet vid andra bordet :( men det berodde väl mest på att dom fick den på fel hand|pg||
nt|oliverc: Chance for Israel here|pg||
nt|pikonlu: acik odada 2nt oynanýyor|pg||
mb|1H!|nt|shevek: far from it|pg||
nt|Gerben42: should have said "safe" rather than safe |pg||
nt|hawe45:  More - no-swing-boards - 10 or 11 tricks in 4 @H|pg||
nt|daman: the @H suit has some promise|pg||
nt|nyg8:  but bery hard defence|pg||
mb|p!|nt|pelu: :(:(|pg||
nt|rodvenn: pass. inviteing 6?|pg||
nt|andersk: a safe 5@S from Ekren|pg||
nt|andersk: I suppose pass should be invite|pg||
nt|rodvenn: but this is not a clear forcing pass situation?|pg||
nt|rodvenn: nobody vulnerable|pg||
nt|andersk: I think it is clear|pg||
nt|haans: take out x had been better that 3nt|pg||
nt|arvidsson: ja blev svårare från andra handen med kl genom AQ|pg||
nt|koksoy: 2@C  demekki  biraz  daha  fazla  da  olabiliyormus ...  ya  da  yanlýs  saydý|pg||
nt|tez: 5 el dýþarý|pg||
nt|haans: 1@S never easy|pg||
nt|james_h: this may be a canape overcall|pg||
nt|james_h: showing 3+h and 5 other|pg||
nt|james_h: if so, 3@d looks right|pg||
nt|haans: Nystrom to bid spade wathever|pg||
mb|1S|nt|rodvenn: no forcing bids from EW|pg||
nt|rodvenn: why do you think it is clear? 4 spades may be a strong hand|pg||
nt|andersk: what is worse case, to pay out 650 instead of 450|pg||
nt|rnmalik: how would they bid, lets see.|pg||
nt|pauleger: 6NT played in the open room|pg||
nt|rnmalik: J@D dropping makeable contract 6NT.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 5@D+4@S+2@H+1@C=12.|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: W thinking 6 or 7. 4@C RKC imo.|pg||
nt|haans: but all bids have a cost|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: hard to reach a club contract- weired x here, their style i thk to x with 15 +|pg||
nt|rnmalik: slam time, 6@H for NS, lose 1@D only. K@C rightly placed but should not be bid.|pg||
nt|james_h: ah ha|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: Correctly pointed out 7 covered by 8, would have a different story.|pg||
nt|nyg8:  unfortuntately, H lead sets up 4H tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodvenn: ok. let us see if the 2 of @s comes as i predicted|pg||
nt|andersk: looks like EW agrees that it was forceing.....sometime when opo is agressive....you just have to keep agreements|pg||
nt|rodvenn: peaple have different agrrements as to what is forcing pass sit|pg||
nt|rodvenn: Ingmarsson probably had a good agreement and could pass|pg||

nt|andyv:  why is it when you decide to open a hand like E's, you always end up in 2NT?|pg||
nt|andersk: I think pass must be an invite against any "real" 5@D and no invite against a save 5@D bid|pg||
nt|rodvenn: now Ekren will not find the club shift i think|pg||
nt|pauleger: rest: answering RKCB|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 4@s|pg||
nt|lestergold: lousy contract and a shortage of entries to fimnesse dims twice|pg||
nt|copeyj: as does a NT partial i think|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S too high  unless a diamond lead|pg||
nt|h_karluk: with 18 and 5134 i cannot imagine a partscore|pg||
nt|koksoy: fena..|pg||
pc|s2|nt|haans: an easy make|pg||
nt|jfaria: this time 1@c is what it most often is : weak bal|pg||
nt|dimi: EW can make 4@h if they get everything right|pg||
nt|hawe45:  They need nothing right - at least  10 tricks|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|shevek: with the black aces in the right place, this will make|pg||
nt|hedyg: now 3NT?|pg||
nt|hedyg: as in OR|pg||
nt|mikael_w: bra spelat av S som lägger @s K här :)|pg||
nt|tez: eldeki bir keklik çalýlýklardaki iki keklikten iyidir dedi|pg||
pc|sK|nt|h_karluk: spots decent worths to push|pg||
nt|lestergold: clubs could make a lot of tricks witgh the two three three breaks|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and both sides were nonvul|pg||
nt|ady: can make 11 tricks in clubs without a heart lead  |pg||
nt|haans: odd for lead from A|pg||
nt|haans: harder to lead from Q|pg||
nt|rnmalik: now it will make. K@D the best chance.|pg||
nt|haans: here a big difference from MP|pg||
nt|haans: lead from Q as sort of psyche|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  with bidding suggested @d lead, declarer has little chance|pg||
nt|eweber: was there a misunderstanding?|pg||
nt|pitiful:  lots of bidding here|pg||
nt|mamos: defence has at least one mor chance to find Diamond tricks|pg||
nt|pitiful:  I expect north did not mean 3@h as invite|pg||
nt|eweber: seeing the North hand I would assume 3@h was meant as not inv opposite a 10-12|pg||
nt|pitiful:  probably thinks 3@d is available as game try|pg||
nt|nyg8:  but that is still on 8 tricks|pg||
nt|nyg8:  lets see.|pg||
pc|s9|nt|lestergold: any rate nice safe spot|pg||
nt|nyg8:  hmm. lets see if they find the magic defence|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if West plays ace and a club he can duck when the queen appears...assuming North doesn't dump it under the ace  |pg||
nt|pikonlu: 2 iceri ile kurtarýrak yine iyi|pg||
nt|james_h: only 50s|pg||
pc|s3|nt|mamos: do we know what double showed?|pg||
nt|dimi: doctores are not that brave today|pg||
pc|d3|pg||
nt|xenya: the score that we see on our screens should be ignored -- too many errors -- see board 7, for instance|pg||
nt|shevek: hmmmm|pg||
nt|jfaria: no way to loose 6 tricks|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  or 2@s - if @s suit is known|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Allt för att ge sken av att han har 2 st @h så att V skall ducka när @h spelas mot bordet|pg||
nt|tez: evet..koz koz oynarlarsa|pg||
nt|haans: 250 300 p|pg||
nt|james_h: wd Micheal|pg||
pc|dA|nt|hedyg: i assume they dont play lebensohl here after the double|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Men denna gången spelar det ingen roll när V har ALLT i @h|pg||
nt|affe82: bra offring ock|pg||
pc|d6|nt|h_karluk: @S j now and @h hook needed for the jack, rest cake and walk|pg||
nt|jfaria: y, extra trick depends on handling @h|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so NS gets a @s, a @h and 2 @d|pg||
pc|dK|nt|hedyg: else N should have continued|pg||
nt|nyg8:  that was the point before. N must unblock the cQ to give S and entry|pg||
nt|desert: i have to leave...have fun and bye|pg||
nt|koksoy: koz  defansý  gelirse  2 iceri  imkansýz|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|pelu: and 3@C over 2NT prob forcing - so thats not an option|pg||
nt|pitiful:  yes 2@s as well|pg||
nt|pitiful:  :)|pg||
nt|eweber: good defense against a making 3@d contract :)|pg||
nt|mamos: must take diamonds now|pg||
nt|oliverc: thanks Martin|pg||
pc|d2|pc|d8|nt|shevek: the play here is also dubious|pg||
nt|mamos: :(|pg||
pc|s5|nt|lestergold: push has tiome to set up spade to make 6|pg||
nt|ludewig: unspectacular 1 down|pg||
nt|Gerben42: live scores: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/10Ostend/Results.htm - note that the women have the morning off|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: its hard to play 3 matches a day- against tough opponents- so you lose concentration sometimes|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|pelu: in the "good old days" - before 1NT F1 - u could bid 2@C in East|pg||
nt|andyv:  it would be for me|pg||
nt|pelu: there are 1 convention I realy dont like. thats the 1NT Forcing - dont hear me, if u like that convention :):)|pg||
nt|oliverc: timid auction by the German pair in the OR on this hand, I feel|pg||
nt|koksoy: böyle  iyi..  :)|pg||
pc|c4|pc|c9|nt|andyv:  Dubinin really taking this long?  unusual for him.|pg||
pc|cA|nt|ady: settling for 10 tricks|pg||
nt|h_karluk: well done|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|haans: better this match then first no score at all then|pg||
nt|shevek: hahaha they made 6@h on both sides!|pg||
nt|tez: ilk kötü bordlarý|pg||
nt|haans: psyches pay best in MP|pg||
nt|eamongall: ah I was doing my work .... and I missed some innovation by Michael O Briain |pg||
mc|2|nt|pelu: u dont have to look for running scores - all tre group are off-line - hard to start a big tournament as this - over 60 teams - and more from saturday (Senior !!!)|pg||
nt|vugraphzns: yes |pg||
nt|haans: have you never done that?|pg||
nt|pauleger: will try the squeeze for the overtrick|pg||

nt|janhamhurg: a freak coming here!|pg||
nt|Gerben42: whoa|pg||
nt|arvidsson: var det verkligen en bra offring ?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  We have plyed very slowly at this table - but how in the other room?|pg||
nt|nyg8:  N should throw the h|pg||
nt|mdgraham: really?|pg||
nt|nyg8:  to ask for S lead maybe....|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|shevek: yes, once the team mates sit the same way :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: costly but lead was good. Kept E thinking.|pg||
nt|jfaria: not ver exciting hands... |pg||
nt|h_karluk: either all pass or Fucik opens|pg||
nt|haans: 14 4@S a make|pg||
nt|hedyg: in OR 2@H showed @H +m and 3@c was pass or correct|pg||
nt|hedyg: not strange at all really|pg||

nt|andreasw:  after 2@h it should be normal to|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 1@C strong|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: that looks as someone has made it up to produce a big swing|pg||
nt|Gerben42: really 5@H?|pg||
nt|vugraphzns: yes|pg||
nt|arvidsson: mot 3spader tänkte du då?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Good and fast bid 6 @D here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if play went as shown, spade shift would beat 3NT..maybe sequnce was different |pg||
mb|2H|nt|jallerton: 3 imps if 4@s made exactly|pg||
nt|paulg:  sorry, yes|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes here also 2@H= 5@H +4m|pg||
nt|Gerben42: ?!|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: transfer to @S (4+) could have a longer minor|pg||
nt|andyv:  20-20 hands usually don't travel too far in the bidding|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South likely to bid 2@S - unless 3@D would be a splinter|pg||
nt|mdgraham: and the hand is a bit weak for that action|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|paulg:  just trying to help Hans|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|eweber: 5 Imps for GER in board 10, Sally bid 2NT vs this wk2 on @h 10xxxxxx, ending up in 3@sX for 800|pg||
nt|mamos: id guess that germany are winning the match at the moment|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2NT asks|pg||
nt|affe82: sry. sant.|pg||
nt|MolvaM: diðer masa skoruna baktým da. isterseniz ben gideyim :(|pg||
nt|koksoy: sanki  4  el  defansa  var  gibi|pg||
nt|phantoma: @C promosyonu ile batiyor 4@H|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: South undeterred.... |pg||
nt|andyv:  good call, Mike|pg||
nt|haans: and how many deals until you found out?|pg||
nt|pauleger: unfortunately i have to mention, that he took the best line in @d|pg||
nt|pauleger: the book will say cash one top@d and then finesse|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Against 6NT in OR @S was led and E played AK@D and made the contract.|pg||
nt|haans: 4 down to equal score|pg||
nt|eweber: making this incredible 4@h will bring in some more!|pg||
nt|affe82: missade 44an i @h|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodvenn: puppet|pg||
nt|jallerton: dyou agree with South's 2nd pass?|pg||
nt|Gerben42: showing @S or @C and @D I guess :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  200 % - wo wohnst Du (ruhig, Ich komme nicht...?)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Sorry, private|pg||
nt|hawe45:  What does 3 @D mean - with so good cards?|pg||
nt|eamongall: well if you do a psyche make sure you have a good place to run to and an understanding partner |pg||
pc|sJ|nt|h_karluk: surprised to watch off-beat weak bicolor opening|pg||
nt|copeyj: pretty sure it is cold on @C lead mike.. @S to A, ruff, @D to Q, ruff @S, @H to A, ruff @S, cross to @D and pitch @C|pg||
nt|paulg:  i would definitely bid|pg||
nt|haans: to much in @D|pg||

nt|rodvenn: showing 5 spades i guess|pg||
nt|ady: 2NT   leb?|pg||
nt|lestergold: leb?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: over x not|pg||
nt|jallerton: no, Jason Hackett is playing, not commentating.  He bid 1@h|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 6@D = pass with minors, bid 6@S otherwise|pg||
nt|arvidsson: men lätt hänt att det slinker hem i 4 spader|pg||

nt|yusufb: geri alma felan yokmu|pg||

nt|haans: Nicoleta|pg||
nt|xenya: bye Nicoleta, thanks|pg||
nt|h_karluk: as a passed|pg||
nt|hawe45:  What would 2 @S mean after 2 @H?|pg||
nt|Gerben42: it all makes sense now, in a crazy way|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: great lead!|pg||
nt|pikonlu: 4kor -1'dense bu daha iyi bir skor|pg||
nt|aydinu: mahalesef öbür masada 4 kör yapýldý|pg||
pc|s7|pg||
nt|andyv:  although stiff Aces are not a favorite to show as splinters|pg||
nt|lestergold: what then?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that's the question|pg||
nt|ady: 3@D  I would think is a break  showing good clubs|pg||
nt|andreasw:  my guess is to stand|pg||
nt|hedyg:  7 @ss no interest any other suit|pg||
nt|Gerben42: bad timing for the agressive move by W|pg||
nt|ludewig: over 1@S from S nobody would bid less than 4 or maybe 5NT|pg||
pc|s5|nt|pelu: 3@D look like and overbid, 1@H from N could be very weak|pg||
nt|rmb1: 2@S used to be a bad preempt in any suit.  Do they still play that?  It is brown sticker, is it allowed?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: seems just a seam in their sys|pg||
nt|h_karluk: brown supposedly allowed|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Ah - I see...|pg||
pc|sK|nt|andersk: 2 key's missing, should stop in 5@S|pg||
nt|lestergold: in some nbooks its simply a minimum 1 @s opener|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i guess even red stickers|pg||
nt|ady: west baled out as soon as possible|pg||
nt|hedyg: something like that|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Ah - East also bids West cards - I see|pg||
nt|mdgraham: can you confirm result on14, Thierry? |pg||
nt|nyg8:  why not X 3S?|pg||
nt|eamongall: I don't find many players around who only make 2 level bids with 7 cord suits |pg||
pc|s4|nt|paulg:  a lot is down to style too ... would Fredin double if the ace of diamonds were the ace of spades?|pg||
nt|mamos: Its useful to play 2@S as natural here after t/o double and South's 1@S|pg||
pc|s8|pg||
nt|andyv:  not a favorite to make|pg||
nt|pelu: but there are 10 tricks on cross-ruff|pg||
nt|andyv:  I see 9|pg||
nt|pelu: - oh wrong calculation - lets try again|pg||
nt|xenya: N must be disgusted to see the singleton @D is the Ace|pg||
nt|pelu: give S @CA and a fine game|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Vladimir|pg||
nt|mdgraham: a friend of mine comments that a trump lead would defeat this  - and I think he is right|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Andy -- and everyone|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but v diff to find a trump from Qx  |pg||
nt|rnmalik: We are at Board 15, any idea about the score?|pg||
nt|andersk: I dont understand 5@D>, maybe 4@D is trelde?|pg||
nt|lestergold: can t cross to the second dim because of the 9 dims doubleton q was only dimn higher  in dummy|pg||
nt|copeyj: 3@D in townsend's hand|pg||
nt|jallerton: at "red" opposite a passed partner?  I suspect not|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  agree. S can bid @s as psychic, having good @d fit (if N's opening shows @d)|pg||
nt|mamos: declarer has work to do|pg||
nt|hawe45:  The ending of thos match will be very bad for Slovakia - very expensive, and Germany needs it|pg||
nt|hawe45:  With such a good hand, West should - having passed - bid 3 @H|pg||
nt|haans: psyches can make opps doing worse after the psyche even if the psycheitselve cost|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|xenya: interestingly, 4@H could be beaten on the lead of a SMALL spade|pg||
nt|haans: as kibs say EW took+ 200 at or so ...|pg||
nt|mikael_w: det här ser ut som ett sterilt kontrakt, när @h sitter så här|pg||
pc|cT|nt|rodvenn: so what is 5 @d?|pg||
nt|Gerben42: psychologically +1000 +800 will do the Germans well|pg||
nt|MolvaM: neyseki zonda deðil|pg||
pc|cA|nt|haans: let them count to tired|pg||
nt|eweber: Heather must know that she is playing against 4 trumps in the South hand now|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: but its hard to stop below 5 clubs- so the gain might be just 300|pg||
nt|Gerben42: in std system the auction might go: 1@S (2NT) pass (3@D) ; 3@H (4@C) Dbl end|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|pelu: no running score - no results from Op - so ...........:(:(|pg||
nt|rodvenn: ok now a lightner double?|pg||
nt|andersk: does he beleve 4 key's?|pg||
nt|rodvenn: 4 @d natural?|pg||
nt|andersk: 5@C 03 5@D 14 and @D K?|pg||
nt|andersk: then they will bid 7|pg||
nt|copeyj: cash two rounds @D and cross with third|pg||
nt|lestergold: well this unofrtunately is a bridge or two too far even 1n was in danger as cards are spitting here|pg||
nt|koksoy: coservative  style  of  N if  he  has  responded  with  5 points  they  will  reach better 3@C contract|pg||
pc|h5|nt|lestergold: east may have to drop tye stiff HK with no obvious entries tov finesse the heart|pg||
nt|arvidsson: ja 10 enkla kommer det nog att bli|pg||
pc|hK|nt|janhamhurg: not with 7-6 gerben!|pg||
nt|Gerben42: bidding 4@C voluntarily on this auction surely shows my hand with pd promising nothing|pg||
nt|ludewig: the other table is in 5D with S to bid (after 1Club - 4NT)|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: now a spade is best|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lestergold: anolther swin g to denmark undoubetdly|pg||
nt|lestergold: Noty convinced Townsend had an acceptance of the invite|pg||
nt|hedyg: why 10@c?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Why not?|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|eweber: trying for a cross ruff is the logical consequence|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Has the 9 himself|pg||
nt|hedyg: exactly!|pg||
nt|MolvaM: sadece 7 imp|pg||
nt|haans: rattle their brain|pg||
mc|11|nt|andersk: this looks strange|pg||
nt|hedyg: why not allow opps to make a mistake and play A@c?|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: might be - 5 now|pg||
nt|MolvaM: zonda olsaydýk 11 verecektik|pg||

nt|eamongall: I don't know the answer to board 15 ... is it a 2@H bid or is it a 2.5@H bid |pg||
nt|haans: may stay for a full evening|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: roland in it therefore|pg||
nt|lestergold: ordinary mortals in 6 of course|pg||
nt|jfaria: crossed voids in EW but no time to tell |pg||
nt|haans: dirty 2nt|pg||
nt|jallerton: West has an awkward hand playing strong NT.  What should he rebid?|pg||
nt|haans: 1nt my choice but see u point|pg||
nt|jallerton: weak NT players would rebid 1NT and say "what is the problem?"|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|paulg:  i think 2NT is fine when partner has shown values|pg||
nt|haans: weak nt for pairs |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  but disciplinied pass followed...|pg||
mb|4H|nt|Gerben42: reward for a most quiet auction goes to Jansma - Paulissen|pg||

mb|p|nt|pelu: but late arivel can explain|pg||
nt|pauleger: piekarek tested @ss first to check, how they behave|pg||
nt|h_karluk: maybe 7 :P|pg||
nt|copeyj: 4@C from Dubinin now? or 4@h?|pg||
nt|copeyj: he has a super fly hand|pg||
nt|h_karluk: which given layout makes|pg||
nt|yusufb: ataktan yaparýz cunki |pg||
mb|p|nt|jfaria: no strugle, a very good board for NL|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i did not mention to find @h jack, but i believed that was easy after opening bid |pg||
nt|arvidsson: borde vara enkel att bjuda|pg||
nt|vugraphzns: +1|pg||
nt|nyg8:  perfect D leads to 11 tricks for EW but hard to see that|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ok, thanks|pg||
nt|MolvaM: zorlu minörler olarak aldý herhalde|pg||
nt|koksoy: 4 nt  ne  demek  acaba??|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well being an english commentator im not allowed bias or have fabtasies about the twions bidding 7 and the ussians bidding 6|pg||
nt|copeyj: wonder if this might be a 6 keycard situation for some pairs|pg||
nt|vasmar: Good evening all|pg||
nt|h_karluk: welcome to Vassilis Virvidakis|pg||
nt|paulg:  the diamond break will kill this, even on a low spade lead|pg||

nt|vugraphzns: Thank you to all |pg||
nt|dimi: 12 imps, nice |pg||
nt|Gerben42: 1@S (2NT) p (p); 3@H (4@C) X end - 300|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Ouf - rebid of J 7 5 3 2 - call a doctor|pg||
pc|d9|nt|h_karluk: for slam you do not need @h hook, for grandslam you need and it works|pg||
nt|haans: 1nt less underbid that 2nt is overbid|pg||
nt|mikael_w: enkel att bjuda, men skall spelas hem också :)|pg||
nt|arvidsson: svårigheterna är att visa upp singel ruter och bra spader|pg||
nt|mikael_w: krävs väl rättgiss i @h|pg||
nt|hawe45:  West should naturally bid 2 @D|pg||
nt|james_h: @d9!|pg||
nt|james_h: but it wont matter|pg||
pc|d5|nt|andyv:  2@h the extent of this hand|pg||
nt|rodvenn: Usually Norway bids these Norwegian slams|pg||
nt|tez: @h atak edilirse 7 oynayýp yapar mýyýz?yerden @s vale oynayarak:)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|pelu: some would X in N in 3. round NS easy make 9 tricks i minor|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so for slam that's perfect, for grandslam 50-50|pg||
nt|haans: 1nt 11-13 |pg||
nt|jfaria: wonder how many EW will have the guts to bid ...|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hi|pg||
nt|paulg:  South's silence over the double was heard by Fredin|pg||
nt|arvidsson: att spela hem denna tror jag de klarar|pg||
nt|arvidsson: nej de kastar en hj på kl|pg||
nt|tez: diyecektimki|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|h_karluk: given layout everything on the right spot|pg||
nt|jfaria: hi|pg||
nt|haans: lead going for blood|pg||
nt|toniemme: qui dopo attacco a @D è più fatrtibile il gioco di sorpasso a @C dato che il mancato intervento di sud farà piazzare al giocante il k@C in nord..|pg||
nt|eamongall: just worth a double + then 2@h but on another day this would be an overbid - I think 2@h is just too heavy..... from a respected irish player |pg||
pc|dT|nt|rnmalik: True pass from N looked unreal.|pg||
nt|arvidsson: krävs uttrumfning|pg||
pc|d6|nt|pelu: need to find the @s-ruff to defeat 2@h|pg||
nt|xenya: the 2@H bid has proved rather fortunate here|pg||
nt|andyv:  certainly the vul is right|pg||
nt|pelu: and if partner bid @S then he has played on 4-3 before :)|pg||
nt|mikael_w: oppps, såg inte att det var AK på bordet :)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|rmb1: We can't tell if @HK is a key card,|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i hope you are back to home from office :)|pg||
nt|koksoy: 2  ciftimizde   güzel  oynuyor  demistim  nazarým  degdi..|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|copeyj: if 3@h showed 5+@S (as is fairly likely) then 4N is either 6 keycard bwood or keycard for @S imo|pg||
nt|jallerton: was South close to a double of 3NT?|pg||
nt|paulg:  opposite a non-vulnerable Fredin overcall? Probably not.|pg||
nt|jallerton: he has all the suits stopped and can even supply a spade honour if partner leads his suit|pg||
nt|eweber: and an unlucky lead|pg||
nt|hawe45:  And a @D|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 6 yapabilirse anca egale edebilecek|pg||
nt|james_h: 2h does not convey the hand - nough said|pg||
nt|haans: 2nt skansk invite = do not tell anything you p (dummy) tell me|pg||
pc|hK|nt|h_karluk: or just ask K and roll the dice - worst scenario|pg||
nt|copeyj: and judging by response id say just kc for @S|pg||
nt|haans: Fallenius are sitting asking "were is 2 down"|pg||
nt|jallerton: but I agree that his does depend on partner;s style of overcalls to an extent|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|rmb1: East knows West can't have enough for grand, given limited 1@D opening|pg||
nt|copeyj: england in 7@S next door|pg||
nt|daman: -2   but they should make at least 3@S EW|pg||
pc|h4|nt|h_karluk: let me visit and brb|pg||
nt|lestergold: we are not allowed to show any pleasure Simon at that foprtuitous result|pg||

nt|h_karluk: oh ok, time for a deep finesse in @d suit? :)|pg||
nt|toniemme: mariani maschera la Dama..|pg||

nt|hedyg: bye Andi :)|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|haans: boring|pg||
nt|rnmalik: such an action hand-one bid and over.|pg||
nt|toniemme: now low club for not easy defense..|pg||
nt|hedyg: he will not find it|pg||
nt|toniemme: 4@C 4@S 1ruf and 1@H|pg||
nt|hedyg: count to 10 and play small @c|pg||
nt|dimi: this will make |pg||
nt|daman: unless a trumps is led|pg||

nt|lestergold: well not good|pg||

nt|affe82: 13?|pg||
nt|affe82: 4@c I meam..|pg||

mb|p|nt|rnmalik: indeed-vul 3@H means something and E passed 4@C with that hand.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: oh yes they are in 7|pg||
nt|copeyj: Jason Hackett bid 3@S over 1@S (a massive difference in hand evaluation because he was not in a limited system)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: undeserved technically but when you ar behind you need a little push and luck|pg||
nt|rnmalik: :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: well, that board would be a breakpoint|pg||
nt|nyg8:  that was my point - 11 tricks for EW....|pg||

nt|nyg8:  if you guess the Clubs|pg||
mb|1H|nt|h_karluk: walls have ears|pg||
nt|copeyj: and when justin asked about Ks, he heard 6@D which i believe was that K or the other two - so Justin knew at worst on a hook and could be solid|pg||
mb|1N|nt|haans: 3nt best|pg||

mb|2C!|nt|andyv:  3N and 4@s make here|pg||
nt|h_karluk: in my book 7 means adventure|pg||
nt|paulg:  getting a flat board, going down in game when your team mates make part score, is always amusing when you score up|pg||
nt|haans: less that 11-13 raise (2@H)|pg||
nt|jallerton: 2@s = @s+@c?|pg||
nt|mamos: North has a huge hand for 10-12 NT |pg||

mb|3N|nt|h_karluk: however this was a lucky day, who knows tomorrow|pg||

nt|Gerben42: 3NT seems to have a shot though|pg||
nt|mdgraham: can't see EW doing any more bididng, but you never know|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: interesting decision to bid 4@S....presumably 3@S showed (at least) three |pg||
nt|vasmar: if he finds clubs he can get 10 tricks|pg||
nt|h_karluk: minor major in a single bid, in te rest ing|pg||

nt|yusufb: yada @s atak olmazsa tezcanýn dedigi gibi|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  seems odd that S would insist on @s game |pg||
nt|haans: 3nt would have been slam try|pg||
nt|xenya: quite a helpful lead...|pg||
nt|haans: usually no singel but slammish|pg||
nt|arvidsson: jag tror på hemgång fortfarande|pg||

mb|p|nt|dimi: not the best lead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South has quite a good case to pull the double|pg||
nt|eamongall: the 1@H opening is likely to drive sweden into 3NT|pg||
nt|haans: 3nt sure make|pg||
pc|d5|nt|andyv:  can't believe 3@s showed 3... S is never allowed to get out in 3@s?|pg||
nt|haans: (Häxan = Witsch)|pg||

nt|vasmar: but he is afraid of many minor losers|pg||
nt|jfaria: those calls are ackward to meet when weak and get strong fit, otherwise a very big gap to to fill|pg||
nt|paulg:  it seems random to me with no outside entry, even if his minor values are soft|pg||
nt|haans: Time tomorrow: 10.30 13.30 central time|pg||
nt|paulg:  As I said at the start, this result will count in the second round robin as well as teams only play the qualifiers from the other group|pg||
nt|jallerton: Why can't they start at the same time each day?|pg||
nt|haans: 9.30 am 12.30 pm your time|pg||

mb|p|nt|haans: bye Vladimir|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: bye Hans, thanks|pg||

mb|1C!|nt|xenya: might be a delicate contract though|pg||
nt|copeyj: i guess|pg||
nt|mamos: ew will bid game i think|pg||
nt|eweber: right, I am wondering whether their strong club system made things difficult or possible here...|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Interesting hand.|pg||
nt|yusufb: 3nt|pg||
nt|tez: batýyor..ne iþimiz var:)|pg||
nt|eamongall: If Terry Walsh meets Lauria that will be good but I suspect Lauria will be in the next round and Terry will be watching ...but the Fat Person has yet to sing ... :):) politically ...|pg||
nt|eamongall: correct |pg||
mb|d!|nt|dimi: a lot of distribution around but no game seems to be available|pg||

nt|vasmar: if you play anti flannery you must get these hands usually :) |pg||
mb|1H|nt|hawe45:  @S 9 - and it is over|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodvenn: 3 nt is a natural contract which will make|pg||
nt|lestergold: difficult hands to bid n/s|pg||
nt|copeyj: altho townsend may double 2@H for t/o|pg||
nt|copeyj: but hasnt|pg||
nt|copeyj: too much of his hand in @H|pg||
nt|vasmar: trump lead|pg||
nt|h_karluk: guys that's antiflannery, 1st time saw around 1987 in some Brasil international team, the next year was popular amongst many Europeans but quickly disappeared, now back again|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Difficult lead for North|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North may contest this - 2NT?|pg||
nt|nyg8:  X is dangerous with onl 2H|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: hmm...|pg||
nt|lestergold: Gold has decided to get out of this misfit auction early|pg||
nt|lestergold: shouldbe able to scramble 8 tricks here|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i guess the twins like to toll the dice|pg||
nt|lestergold: a PLUS SCORTE ON THESE CARDS WOULD BE VERY GOOD FOR N/S|pg||
nt|h_karluk: *roll|pg||
nt|paulg:  when I see that they play in 4@h in the other room, i presume someone passed Redwood (keycard in diamonds)|pg||
nt|jallerton: Burn's Law violation in other room|pg||
nt|haans: better contract|pg||
nt|haans: no E did make a take out|pg||
nt|haans: W took out|pg||
nt|jillan:  The bidding was "slighty" different. South opened  1S and North bid 2S.. |pg||
nt|paulg:  Looks like the Hacketts created most of the trouble by opening the South hand|pg||
nt|jallerton: In fact 6@d is where you want to be - not easy|pg||
mb|d|nt|pauleger: this wont make|pg||
nt|lestergold: caps lock by mistake sorry|pg||
nt|haans: believe 3@C was GF|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Jag antar att 1 @h visar @s, så nu behöver inte Cullin oroa sig för den färgen längre|pg||
nt|koksoy: as diamonds are favoritly  divided 10 tricks  can  be  taken  in  spade contract|pg||
nt|nyg8:  i would have bid 2N to shows 6-4 in minirs|pg||
nt|koksoy: peki  rakibin  3@S  oynamasýný???|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  lead helpful to declarer|pg||
nt|mikael_w: nu gäller det att dom vet vad som händer så att inte Uppmark tar detta som starkt och bra stöd i @c|pg||
nt|mikael_w: men dom har säkert bra ordning på sådant, men man blir ju alltid lite orolig|pg||
nt|affe82: 5@d är väl vad som kan försökas. men det blir väl tungt med trumf fran försvaret ngn gang.|pg||
nt|mikael_w: ja, jag tror man skall vara glad om man går hem i delkontrakt i @d här|pg||
mb|1S|nt|mdgraham: double|pg||
nt|mdgraham: by West|pg||
nt|nyg8:  S will bid 4D now|pg||
nt|nyg8:  giving N an option with only 2H|pg||
nt|mdgraham: can South infer that North has diamonds|pg||
nt|james_h: Dbl is probably reds or blacks|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: no worries, its fine|pg||
nt|mamos: i think South needs to lead Hearts |pg||
nt|mamos: after cashing will do|pg||
nt|mamos: if not North will be endplayed |pg||
nt|mikael_w: ajajaj|pg||
nt|affe82: vi kan enas om att det fanns 3 andra trumffärger som var bättre iaf.|pg||
nt|eamongall: Michael O'Briain must have taken some action drink halfway thru this match |pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: perhaps N expected to find S with xx xxx xx xxxxxx|pg||
nt|jallerton: Mari-Volcker(France) and Stockdale/Brown (Eng ladies) made 6@d I hear|pg||
nt|mikael_w: det var just detta jag syftade på, men det ÄR jobbigt när fi bjuder hela tiden|pg||
nt|rnmalik: can make 4 with a chance to play @D thrice and entry retained in dummy.|pg||
nt|koksoy: ým  sure   he  would  play  on  diamods  if  he had  played  4|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West content|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodvenn: prabably with overtricks|pg||
nt|rnmalik: had 9 top tricks and with @D lead 10.|pg||
nt|haans: sweden have increased there lead|pg||
nt|Gerben42: its very close though, for example @CA onside would suffice|pg||
nt|dimi: 3@hs and a @s trick as a minimum|pg||
nt|haans: i like the Irish bidding|pg||
nt|haans: but ...|pg||
pc|h7|nt|Gerben42: 4-0 break of course not helpful|pg||
nt|mikael_w: och det skall det vara|pg||
nt|koksoy: gündüz  tarifesinden  ?|pg||
pc|h6|nt|jallerton: Perhaps 4@s is Flint here, trying to sign off somewhere|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jfaria: now Fuck can ruff some @h|pg||
nt|jallerton: 4@d|pg||
nt|haans: holy ...|pg||
nt|affe82: men @d ut erbjuder möjligheten att lata syd stjäla ett gäng höga ruter.|pg||
nt|eamongall: well he has just actioned away 6 imps |pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Fucik worked for that|pg||
pc|h3|nt|paulg:  hard to know what range East has actually shown |pg||
nt|jallerton: they were not many IMPs at stake anyway, Hans assuming EW made a plus score|pg||
pc|h2|nt|affe82: gar nog nagon bet här.|pg||
pc|hT|nt|haans: nice knowing who has the king|pg||

nt|james_h: well he has favourable Vul so its fun to mess about|pg||
pc|h5|nt|vasmar: Purka yo mean|pg||
pc|h9|nt|jallerton: I suspect West was just signing off in 5@d, Paul|pg||
nt|haans: 2nd opinion: pauleGER: not "well done" ? ME: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO|pg||
nt|mamos: still ok if plays Heart when in with Club|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Jag misstänker att Cullin var orolig för att bli bortpsykad här. och Uppmark földe regeln att med missanpassning så gäller dett stanna så lågt som möjligt|pg||
nt|tez: @c ataðýna batardý belkide|pg||
pc|h4|nt|h_karluk: you are a regular commentator and we are sure that a nice personality there :)|pg||

pc|c4|pg||
nt|h_karluk: true Gunther is declarer|pg||
nt|dimi: but will be 2 down eventually|pg||
nt|hawe45:  My grandmother would have defeated this 4 @H - by taking her minir-aces...|pg||
nt|hawe45:  minor-|pg||
nt|yusufb: 3nt @c atagýna batar|pg||
nt|eamongall: well a moderate 19 count and a moderate 6 count with iffy trumps don't need much encouragement to stay low |pg||
pc|sA|nt|lestergold: oh dear Towsened has abandoned 2 clubs and the enry form a spade finesse|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I must admit the double of 2@S sounded more like a 1336 shape or similar, rather than 1246   |pg||
nt|james_h: Eamon, you are being too hard here and wrong in my opinion|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|pauleger: -2|pg||
nt|vasmar: he will make easily 9 tricks|pg||

pc|d2|nt|h_karluk: well well|pg||
nt|lestergold: mind u opps will be endplayed at some point|pg||

nt|eamongall: you are welcome James ...but somehow I detect two mouths and 1 ear ... :):)|pg||
mb|2S|nt|rmb1: Didn't the defence have 2 trumps for the last three tricks?  Declarer claiming 2 tricks was unlikely|pg||
nt|h_karluk: oh ACOL|pg||
nt|lestergold: the last few tricks looked strange like why would towsend not play the third spade rather than the heart|pg||
nt|Gerben42: must have been 2NT opening?|pg||
nt|yusufb: 3nt gelinmiþ ama deklerasyon devam ediyomuþ|pg||
nt|haans: Ireland must make 9 first in next 2 sessions|pg||
mb|d!|nt|pauleger: Auken - von Arnim played only 2@h on this board|pg||
nt|mamos: East had a  horrid position   - played South for Kx  which in a way was consistent with her defence  dont know what 1@H from North meant|pg||
nt|mamos: sorry qx|pg||
nt|pitiful:  probably expected south to have more than 10points for 2N|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Take the money - what else|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: 22/18|pg||
nt|jallerton: Thanks also to my co-commentators: Hans, Paul and Ben|pg||
nt|eweber: though she might have expected North to have something for her 1@h bid|pg||
nt|mamos: these handa re glaringly obvious for us .......... but declarer has a different view :)|pg||
nt|eweber: they are playing very quickly, maybe too quick this time|pg||
mb|4H|nt|pitiful:  n-s have a @s partcore here|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 1NT would be 14-16|pg||
nt|dimi: 6@s could be a cheap defense|pg||
nt|Gerben42: strange |pg||
nt|Gerben42: but found the top spot anyway|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @C-lead seems to be best for N/S|pg||
nt|MolvaM: süper|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: Board 17 may result in double swing for Sweden.|pg||
nt|haans: or it may not :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: max flat.|pg||
nt|pitiful:  but e-w would push on to 3@d|pg||
nt|hawe45:  He heard the message|pg||
nt|vugraphzns: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: wonder who will try to balance it out|pg||

nt|Gerben42: that will make!|pg||

mb|p|nt|haans: true|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 3@h ?:) hmm|pg||
nt|vugraphzns: tanks to watch|pg||
nt|eweber: I assume she relied on the fact that Dany never played a @h through|pg||

nt|h_karluk: :)|pg||

nt|paulg:  Thanks everyone, hope to see you tomorrow morning for the battle of two teams no longer in the World Cup ... Scotland vs France|pg||
pc|sA|nt|h_karluk: this only possible very fast players there, also in a long marathon operators got tired|pg||
nt|lestergold: a savage misfit in the side suits and a nasty spade layout|pg||
nt|vugraphzns: yes|pg||
nt|rmb1: Me (and some spec.s - thanks) think defence took 2@H and 4@D|pg||
nt|lestergold: i think we all think that Robin|pg||
nt|vugraphzns: yes some time to fqst|pg||
nt|rmb1: This is the last hand.  Thanks to the operator Thierry Mullens in Ostende and to Hamid, Mike, David and Simon; and to Roland and EBL for organising the broadcast|pg||
