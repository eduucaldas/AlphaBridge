mb|p|nt|rnmalik: This appears to be doomed contract.|pg||

nt|arvidsson: De spelar ett starkklöver system (väldigt likt Bernys system) så mycket relä och många zz har vi framför oss)|pg||

nt|Walddk12: Hello Elke, Mike and Peter|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|mikael_w: well done to play @h A there and not a small one|pg||

nt|hawe45:  If anybody wants explanations about this 2 @D, do not hesitate to write me|pg||
pc|h6|pc|c3|pg||

pc|cQ|nt|mdgraham: EW natural with a strong NT. NS Precision with a 12-14 NT|pg||
nt|yusufb: letonya|pg||
pc|d6|nt|benjy:  I wouldn't have bid 5@D with the south hand, partner was only competing, he could have doubled 3@D or bid 3@H with a good hand|pg||
nt|pitiful:  2@s not for the fainthearted|pg||
pc|c6|pc|s7|pg||
nt|rnmalik: ensuring the contract safety play.|pg||

mb|1S|nt|Walddk1: You must connect to the open room|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Hans|pg||
nt|haans: not as bloody as i first believed|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: you should try to win the matches versus the strong teams in the round robin, because those results count later in the final|pg||
nt|mikael_w: hjälper inte att spela @c då|pg||
nt|arvidsson: tursamt nog ser vi alla händer, gör att vi ibland kan analysera rätt :)|pg||
nt|affe82: utspelet gjorde väl i praktiken att s alltid var hemma|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I make coffee|pg||
nt|oliverc: agreed|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: Hi Nicoleta|pg||
nt|haans: some say that 1/3 of all IMPs you get in defense|pg||
nt|rnmalik: NT-non vul 11-14?|pg||
nt|paulg:  both teams are (almost) certain to qualify for the second stage, so the matches against the other qualifiers are doubled important as the score will be carried over|pg||
nt|dimi: at the other table Baldursson-Jonsson is facing Pikarek-Smirnov|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|Walddk1: You have starated your own broadcast|pg||
nt|xenya: Nicoleta :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/w can make 4@h but will of course be outbid by N/S in spades but at these colours they have good save|pg||
nt|mamos: no it woke us all up with a bang|pg||
nt|dimi: Wladow-Elinescu play a strong @c-system with strong NT |pg||
nt|Gerben42: Baldursson - Jonsson were part of the 1991 Bermuda Bowl team|pg||
nt|mikael_w: ja, efter utspelet så var det nog tungbetat om spelföraren spelade rätt|pg||
nt|affe82: ew ending up in 3@c after a 3rd hand oping by W?|pg||
nt|tez: 5 minor barajý iyi ns için|pg||
nt|koksoy: o  da  iyi  defansa|pg||
nt|koksoy: egale  olacak|pg||
nt|yusufb: 3@d bergen sanýrým|pg||
nt|tez: zonda olmalarý konuþmalarýný zorlaþtýrýyor|pg||
mb|d|nt|haans: no cc for this pair|pg||
nt|desert: and even 3 @H wouldnt have been a walk in the park....|pg||
nt|oliverc: no|pg||
mb|4S|nt|vbman: how come 2 cl down 3?|pg||
nt|rnmalik: difficult hand to bid, the lower contract the better.|pg||
nt|ady: OR stopped in part score so 5 imps for Russia|pg||
nt|copeyj: Hi All|pg||
nt|h_karluk: lucky 4@s in case allowed|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Hi, welcome Simon|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 6D NS|pg||
nt|lestergold: played by N |pg||
nt|mdgraham: 4@S seems a bit drastic|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but the Norht dummy is what you might call suitable |pg||
nt|lestergold: well the upside is that it shuts e/w out whop have good saves|pg||
nt|hedyg: 2@s = 7-10 5@s 4m|pg||
nt|Walddk4: Welcome to Enver Köksoy|pg||
nt|yusufb: @h bilirse 5 olur yoksa 1 imp veririz|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: dubious overcall      but 4@S on|pg||
nt|oliverc: Anyone for a Double by North rather than 1@H?|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk1: Pls look at this|pg||
nt|copeyj: you would have to tie south down with piano wire to get him to pass 4@S|pg||
nt|ady: Townsend  4NT   looking for a minor suit contract |pg||
nt|lestergold: double fit hands are the ones you want to declarer|pg||
nt|lestergold: especially before opps find out they have double fit|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the S heart holding is not one that makes 4S an appetizing call. but of course it could easy work well, e.g. by driving EW too high or by keeping thgem from finding their club game ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: or slam|pg||
nt|marlowepi: the reality is that even though NS have a cold slam, they are never going to get to them 4-4 fit unless N is able to open 1NT or the like. with E dealer, you wouldnt expect one top ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: pair in a hundred to reach 6D|pg||
nt|haans: fallenius did not like it|pg||
nt|sga1: Another 4@h contract.|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: North soon to bid|pg||
nt|xenya: 2@C is weak with @Ds -- or something else maybe|pg||
nt|haans: 2@C weak @D or strong have followers|pg||

nt|rmb1: 6@C makes even on @H lead because defence can not cash second heart|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 9 top tricks at NT.|pg||

nt|h_karluk: this won't be easy|pg||
nt|copeyj: gromov will possibly bid 6@S|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i doubt|pg||
nt|copeyj: can't be expensive and the vulnerability is right|pg||
nt|copeyj: Hello all - sorry I am a bit late|pg||
nt|mamos: South probably seen her partner's protective doubles  before :)|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  hello to all|pg||

pc|h2|pg||
nt|xenya: likely 1 down|pg||
nt|haans: good bidding by South|pg||
nt|h_karluk: already showed intentions and knows his p is not blind|pg||
nt|benjy:  Would you guys bid 3@S with the south hand? Obviously if partner has a fit then you might make a game, but if partner doesn't do you really want him passing or converting to 4@D? Certainly not clear in my opinion.|pg||
nt|pitiful:  looks like 4 or 5  tricks |pg||
nt|arvidsson: 3 @D is the final contract, do you agree on bidding 3 @D Fredrik?|pg||
nt|yuval10: hi all|pg||
nt|desert: well if you think you are strong enough to double 3 Dia later on, you can bid 1 @H :)|pg||

nt|andreasw:  down 3 i think how did they go down in other table?|pg||
pc|hK|nt|Gerben42: the 11th trick needs to come from @C|pg||
nt|sga1: Good to stayout of 4@h as it doesn't make.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: bidding looks quite normal|pg||
nt|daman: not the best lead|pg||
nt|sga1: If E had bid 2NT which is not a bad bid, they would be overboard.|pg||
nt|daman: a @D would have been helpful|pg||
nt|oliverc: problem would benwhen Spades get frozen out of the bidding if East bids some|pg||
nt|oliverc: number of Diamonds|pg||
pc|h7|nt|copeyj: he has no idea if it is cold or no play|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: can he avoid 2 club looser?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: could we have the name sof the players please operator?|pg||
nt|desert: If NS play a weak NT and 1 Cl therefore promises 15-17 when balanced thats not so stupid....|pg||
pc|h4|pg||

nt|Gerben42: first to reach 5@D and second to make it|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: i woudnt recomend the 2 dia overcall, bec being vulnerble there is no chance for declaring this hand|pg||
nt|affe82: i 4@s hade @d 9 legat i disken efter 0.1 vilket gjort det kämpigt. om vi haller med generellt eller inte sa kan vi hursom inte klaga pa resultatet.|pg||

nt|rmb1: South following the sound defence against slams - cash your aces and wait for your trump trick(s)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: likely 3n for EW|pg||
nt|marlowepi: even if it goes 1H-1S-P-2H and S gets to bid Ds, the contract is wrongsided. an auction that places declaration of Ds in N hand is hard to construct|pg||
nt|pitiful:  we have a Roland slam now|pg||

nt|dimi: 11 tricks in @h for NS|pg||

nt|arvidsson: ok west did discard a Heart so declarar made, did not even see that as an possibility|pg||
nt|sga1: May be another contract in @hs unless EW out bid NS.|pg||
nt|oliverc: 4@S possible here given the Club position|pg||
mb|2C|nt|hawe45:  Sorry @S...!|pg||

nt|gohar: 2@s was not his bid i think,,,but they play like this|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This board|pg||
nt|gohar: yes|pg||
nt|Gerben42: standard bidding would be 4@D transfer, because 2@D 2@H 4@H would show slam interest|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Fast som en åskådare precis sa :) Kanske 3 NT igen, och denna gången är det verkligen rätt|pg||
nt|arvidsson: på denna gör man 3nt, men går det att bjuda ?|pg||

mb|5D|nt|h_karluk: pass by Easr quite interesting, perhaps part of their CC|pg||
nt|h_karluk: *East|pg||
nt|ady: e/w have 3NT   easy if playing diamonds from the top   and have other chances even if diamonds are 4-1|pg||
nt|copeyj: Townsend probably thinks e/w have big things on - he will be disappointed in that respect but they are not going to be able to play in 3N now it seems to me|pg||

nt|koksoy: 2or  3@H  by  N is  my guess|pg||
nt|daman: I like 2@D|pg||
nt|henryb:  Now in the US no one would double 1@h with the W hand: 2@d or pass would be the common choices|pg||

mb|p|nt|haans: well not clubs either :)|pg||
nt|shevek: Ron and Blakset play Xfer openings (1@d = @h, 1@h = @ss)|pg||
nt|shevek: 2@h = 5+@h, denies @ss|pg||
nt|shevek: I guess 2@s would've been relay (N/A)|pg||

nt|shevek: system cards @@  http://tinyurl.com/29ud57z|pg||

nt|h_karluk: however still makes 5@d|pg||
nt|ady: can make 12 tricks|pg||
nt|h_karluk: what a slam|pg||
nt|ady: is possible 4 diamonds passed out|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Good morning to Henry Bethe|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Sorry for the typo in the N-S team name, nothing we can do about it now I'm afraid|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 6@C would become tough with @H placement and 3NT makes against any defense.|pg||
nt|mamos: 1NT is Relay I think|pg||
nt|pitiful:  slam is likely to make if they get there|pg||
nt|eweber: NS plays a variable NT, NT opening nv 1st and 2nd seat 10-12|pg||
nt|daman: the Italians always double with those hands    like to show points rather than shape|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: Good morning all|pg||
nt|h_karluk: a bit double dummy|pg||
nt|hedyg: hmm ok|pg||

pc|h5|nt|rnmalik: Hello all and welcome.|pg||
nt|lestergold: at this colour north may compete|pg||

nt|mikael_w: man får nog hemgången i utspelet i 3 nt|pg||
nt|arvidsson: svårt utspel för Johan|pg||
nt|koksoy: 3@H  is  alerted  but  seems  natural invitation|pg||
nt|daman: yes|pg||
nt|mdgraham: EW pretty natural, strong NT. NS Strong Club with control responses, strong NT|pg||
nt|sga1: W in OR found another bid on same hand 1NT.|pg||
nt|daman: 1NT would have been on my radar 30 years ago|pg||
nt|sga1: I agree.|pg||
pc|hA|nt|Walddk1: http://www.ecatsbridge.com/Events/ebl/2010ostend/default.asp  for convention cards and other useful information|pg||
nt|marlowepi: not sure, E has shown values|pg||
nt|marlowepi: with his minors the other way round hewould probably compete|pg||

nt|hawe45:  Surprise...|pg||
nt|hedyg: there it is|pg||
nt|gohar: :)yes|pg||
nt|arvidsson: om man gissar så  har S visad en svag 2:a I @S med minimum intervall|pg||
nt|rnmalik: good pass by S, no extra values.|pg||
nt|koksoy: spec  says ; its a  conventition  ....  its inv hand  with 6 + 1h and 3 @S|pg||
nt|desert: North now must find at least an invitational bid......according to his system...|pg||
nt|yuval10: N upgraded his hand, you'd have think his KX @h will give him a cold legs|pg||

nt|dimi: true Jan, strange most pairs have greements to show 4 card support after txf|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|haans: or more than 8|pg||
nt|ady: west has to legislate for a possible bust with east|pg||
nt|lestergold: nice tame contract for eng|pg||
nt|marlowepi: this seems best startr for defense|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I guess the thing about passing, attractive though it may be, is that there is the possibility of being frozen out of the auction |pg||
pc|dQ|nt|rnmalik: Good Morning Mike.|pg||
nt|copeyj: depends what pass over 1@S showed|pg||
nt|h_karluk: hearts 3-3, d QJ falls and @cK hook works, cheez n crackers :)|pg||
nt|haans: relays when one ask one responed and asker end up playing 3nt (with his hand) that can be tricy for defense|pg||
nt|haans: been there done it :)|pg||
nt|pitiful:  south did not feel obliged to cue bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: and Bosiger went -1......|pg||
nt|arvidsson: vilket talar för trumf eller hj ut (A sitter troligen hos N) |pg||
pc|dJ|nt|copeyj: might be that it showed some values|pg||
nt|benjy:  but how to get there?|pg||
nt|jallerton: though the 4-1 @d break gives both trouble|pg||
nt|andreasw:  other table @c K wad the lead and a @h switch|pg||
pc|d6|nt|lestergold: towsend cannot afford to float this dim|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2H should come in anyway|pg||
nt|lestergold: should be suspicious of the switch|pg||
nt|lestergold: wont comem in if he ducks dim|pg||
nt|copeyj: Askgaard defended very quickly here - Townsend may have picked up on that which may help him to work out what is going on|pg||
nt|marlowepi: he can count five losers if he rises and trumps are ok. but he has to worry about a promoted heart ten|pg||
nt|lestergold: he has safe 8 tricks nowm if he takes the dim|pg||
nt|daman: 3 @D on that collection is very perilous  and he bought a great dummy    if I did that I would go for 800|pg||
nt|sga1: same for me as well :)|pg||
nt|mdgraham: only 800? You must buy good dummies|pg||
nt|henryb:  Perhaps only 500. Imperfect defense and great declarer play :)|pg||
nt|daman: I wish|pg||
nt|henryb:  Actually, with the @h raise there is some reasonable chance of buying some trumps in dummy|pg||
nt|sga1: right as max 1@h so good chances r there.|pg||
nt|daman: my dummy would be xxxx x xx xxxxxx   red|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yup|pg||
pc|d8|pg||
nt|mdgraham: EW Precision, 1NT=12-15 1st and 2nd, 15-17 3rd and 4th|pg||
nt|ady: what dowes one show with a bust?|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mamos: South knows that for Slam to be good she need a lot of cards from North|pg||
nt|eweber: the NS pair in the other room also plays "variable" as I just see, 14-16 in 1/2 nv and else 15-17 |pg||

nt|hawe45:  No good lead for West|pg||
nt|affe82: not that I get the bidding but ending in the denomination and level that was expected.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @S bid encouraged N to bid 3@H.|pg||
nt|koksoy: he needs to guess hearts to  make...  he  must give only 2 heart tricks to defence|pg||
pc|h9|nt|marlowepi: nevertheless i agree he should rise|pg||
nt|lestergold: well he can count a likely 4 hearts dim spade club and club ruff surely|pg||
nt|mamos: cash|pg||
nt|pitiful:  well done by east|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Well-done - the worse lead possible ( J x x x ) was good this time|pg||
nt|affe82: my regular pd has forbidden me to ever lead that. so would have had a hard timing replicating W's good lead here.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @C Queen - and @D to the Queen|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Your regular partner is RIGHT!|pg||

nt|hawe45:  NO @D-loser|pg||
nt|hedyg: oh true|pg||
nt|affe82: no it seems strange..|pg||
nt|oliverc: yes. @C now and even though East wioll ruff, the 10@S an entry to take the @C|pg||
nt|oliverc: finesse a second time|pg||
nt|oliverc: well would have been :)|pg||
nt|oliverc: but needed to run the 5@C :)|pg||
pc|s8|nt|gohar: yes straight hand|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Duck this and finish cross-ruffing for 10 tricks|pg||
nt|affe82: a kibber suggest dropping @s J under A. might give decl a chance to go wrong. at least if on a later board he should get to do the same thing on JTx. kind of interesting play ...|pg||
nt|affe82: really.|pg||
nt|affe82: hans line is better. the drop will prob not happen.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Anyway - no line within some minutes|pg||

nt|h_karluk: so far we have a tied match|pg||

nt|rnmalik: K@H was played to pin the Q.|pg||
nt|yusufb: bayanlarýn formatta elenme yok 28 takým var lig usulü 27 maç yapýlýyor ve bitiyor|pg||
mb|1S|nt|copeyj: slightly fortunate flat board for Russia - 3NT is where you would want to play I should think|pg||
nt|andreasw:  grand slam look's fair|pg||
nt|hedyg: why useless? good for 7NT?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But South leads the @D Q...|pg||
nt|affe82: dags att tänka in ytterligare en 3nt:are|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No, they will play 4 @S - just like in bridge|pg||
nt|mdgraham: which shows in a way that the requirement for a six-card suit to overcall at the two-level is a bit stringent|pg||
nt|desert: thx to the friendly distribution 4 @S is makeble....but i dont think it will be bid|pg||
nt|koksoy: 5@C  2  tane  pik  alýndýktan  sonra  kýrmýzý  renklerden  squeze  ile  oluyor|pg||

nt|marlowepi: that may be a push against 110|pg||

nt|eweber: Sally Brock opened a 14-16 NT with the South hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: easy 4@s for EW players|pg||
nt|mdgraham: two poorish results for the Englsih NS next door - 18-0 Denmark|pg||
nt|copeyj: guess this is what a 5@D overcall looks like|pg||
nt|mdgraham: well, how do you bid that South hand?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 3S|pg||
nt|copeyj: i dont like 3@S|pg||

mb|3N|nt|rnmalik: If played by S has a good chance, but N playing it would be disaster on @S lead.|pg||
nt|copeyj: with a stiff @C|pg||
mb|p|nt|andersk: Norway EW in open room playing 4@H|pg||
nt|haans: why not 2@C i say|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 5@C wins.|pg||
nt|haans: Nyström far behind|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 1@D=?|pg||
nt|benjy:  1@D shows 4+@H|pg||
nt|affe82: still earns them another imp I guess. altman's choice of 3n was a surprise to me.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Sorry, you can NOT ruff a @H - 4 @S is the spot|pg||
nt|koksoy: they  will  reach  4@H  I  suppose|pg||
nt|yuval10: Germany had a chance in the OR when N opened|pg||
nt|desert: you need spades 3-2 and clubs 2-2......|pg||
mb|p|nt|andersk: probably -1|pg||
nt|andreasw:  now 4@s|pg||
nt|andreasw:  then 7 is on the table|pg||
mb|p|nt|rmb1: 1NT = 8+ bal|pg||

nt|affe82: so you don't see him go for the doublefinesse then? lol. no imps. you are right. 11.|pg||
nt|yuval10: perhaps was better to bid invitational X from S than 3@s competitive|pg||
nt|tez: 3@s durudurucu varsa 3 nt oynamak istiyor|pg||
nt|yusufb: bence 1@s 3@s diyen el boyle bir el degil|pg||
nt|aydinu: merci:)|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mdgraham: EW play a 3NT opening as a solid 7-card minor, no outside ace or king - so the West hand is too strong for that|pg||
nt|shevek: well, let's just say the board didn't favour their system :)|pg||
nt|haans: :) lets say that|pg||
nt|copeyj: careful defence leads to down 1|pg||
nt|marlowepi: you cant have everything. you get old waiting for the perfect hand. of course at simon's age we all believe that will never happen:)|pg||
nt|mamos: Board 2 was flat NS collected 150 for getting nine tricks in NT the other way :)|pg||
nt|pitiful:  sort of hand t=you might well upgrade|pg||
nt|eweber: 3@d is a Bergen raise here|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Ah - I see, N/S play Rusinow - North leads the @D Jack...|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: easy dia lead, quick claim|pg||
pc|s4|nt|xenya: it certainly did -- did they fell victim to their own system? Or just to an improper use of it?|pg||
nt|andersk: this will be 9 tricks|pg||
nt|haans: you an opening bid when you have no better|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Sensible to play a jump overcall as intermediate at these colours|pg||
nt|pitiful:  west did too much here imo|pg||
nt|eweber: she probably didn't love to do this with a 4333 distribution, many players treat this like a 3 card trump support|pg||
nt|hedyg: 03 14|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: the 3 is positive|pg||
nt|arvidsson: en så kallad kaffebricka |pg||
nt|daman: they will get to 4@H   and making it is not chopped liver    will probably go one off|pg||
pc|s2|nt|lestergold: accurate defence beats this as no entry to take heart finegle|pg||
nt|Walddk7: With a nice club fit Paulissen had a fair shot at 3NT|pg||
nt|henryb:  well yes, but would you do any worse bidding 2@c and raising partner's 2N to 3?|pg||
nt|Walddk7: No|pg||
nt|rnmalik: appears to be a doomed contract.|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Paulissen searching for his 9th trick|pg||
nt|henryb:  Purka seems to have found an effective lead|pg||
nt|Walddk7: Indeed he has; 4th best from your longest and strongest would not have worked this time|pg||
nt|jallerton: still 3@s seems to have made more tricks that 3@D in practice|pg||
nt|pitiful:  although 3@d is no thing of beauty|pg||
nt|Gerben42: notice that Jonsson did not bid after 1@D, almost making it impossible for Smirnov Piekarek to go plus (even 5@D will be hard to make without information)|pg||
nt|koksoy: &  there is a  club  ruff for  the  defence...  |pg||
nt|rnmalik: I have been informed that 1@C is natural or 15-19 balanced hand.|pg||
nt|koksoy: 3@S =  kapalý  minörle  beraber  7-8 el  alýyorum  ,pik  kesiyorsan  3 nt  de|pg||
nt|aydinu: süleyman 4 cl dedi ...|pg||
nt|tez: ataklarýnýz nasýl diye sorulur..cevap.. super:)|pg||
nt|norby: good lead:-))|pg||
mc|7|nt|h_karluk: counting 10 :)|pg||
nt|copeyj: its not waiting for the perfect hand - it is the fact that I think the S hand is described pretty nicely by 5@D|pg||
nt|marlowepi: well no argument there. its just that the beautifully descriptve bid might get you past your only game|pg||
nt|lestergold: the 13 imp swing was due to the hand in which the danes overcalled 4@s here nhand 2 in thne open a more conservative 3s and north bid 3n whioch was very unfortunate form england|pg||
nt|marlowepi: if you bid 3S you can still get to 5D|pg||
nt|copeyj: wasnt that unfortunate mike - 3n was not where you want to play the hands|pg||
nt|copeyj: but i agree that neither action taken next door was unreasonable|pg||
nt|lestergold: on hand 2 Sanduist not unreasonably wanted to protect his K@h so bid 3n rathe rthan raise the spades but unfortunately they had rien in clubs|pg||
nt|mdgraham: indeed. Very disciplined of South to pass 3N. Good lead from East too.|pg||
nt|lestergold: no that was very unlucky i would not criticvise sandqvist at all for his action|pg||
nt|rnmalik: only makes on @D lead or misdefense.|pg||
nt|haans: we fram sweden say "not fair"|pg||
nt|jallerton: 1@c is not systemic - as I understand their system 1@c is only short if 18-20 bal|pg||
nt|hawe45:  South denied the @H-control - 650|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West has a maximum NT and will surely go on|pg||
nt|oliverc: 3@S here, surely|pg||

nt|lestergold: bid up boys oh sorry im not allowed bias i withdraw that|pg||
nt|mamos: id expect South to bid 2@h|pg||
nt|mikael_w: tycker du det ? det tycker nog inte jag|pg||
nt|affe82: 630 prob. or am I to be surprised again?|pg||
nt|koksoy: wow..  we  forgot agressive E  :)|pg||
nt|sga1: Now as contract makes N may feel it was right bid.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but leads to a terribly direct 620|pg||
nt|koksoy: sevgili  ortagým  bu  boardu  senle  paylastým  :)|pg||
pc|d3|nt|shevek: I used to say that...but...|pg||
nt|copeyj: wow|pg||
nt|rnmalik: shall see, 2@H+1@S=3.|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|dimi: this will be to much|pg||
nt|dimi: -1 likely outcome|pg||
nt|Gerben42: Magnusson meant 2@S as purely comp.|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|shevek: lost a few tight finals :)|pg||
nt|haans: Fredit leads magain|pg||
nt|haans: Fredin|pg||
nt|shevek: agree, not a standard lead :)|pg||
nt|xenya: the layout is quite friendly |pg||
nt|ady: got 12 easy tricks without a diamond lead|pg||
nt|copeyj: 2@S fourth suit, 3N showed non minimum, and 6N was music to my biased ears|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Townsend there, buckle up please (personally m confused why didn't search controls)|pg||
nt|ady: as cards are  better played by North who has not losing choise on a diamond lead|pg||
nt|copeyj: maybe 2@C was not gf - let me find their card|pg||
nt|mdgraham: It doesn't look as though 2@C is FG|pg||
nt|lestergold: well they have just cdemnonstrated that it isnt|pg||
nt|lestergold: this is prob only 1 0ff so another 3 likely to Denmark|pg||
nt|copeyj: 1M - 2@C = @D Sign-offOR any INV w/o fit, w/o 5+OM.|pg||
nt|copeyj: according to their card|pg||
nt|lestergold: actually it may make|pg||
nt|copeyj: and apparently 2@D showed @D support |pg||
nt|pitiful:  and east 3@d|pg||
nt|hedyg: with the right defense...|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: now they play 4- probably - 1, but makes if you find the club queen|pg||
nt|Gerben42: but Haraldsson expected perhaps a tiny bit more than this junkyard|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|copeyj: i think Townsend will need to underlead his @C to get partner in to lead @H through |pg||
nt|lestergold: and if it makes that s a heftier 8 imps in for the danes|pg||
nt|copeyj: although bjarnarson can play A@D then AKQ@S pitching a @C|pg||
nt|lestergold: on this lead townsend has to find an underlead to put goldin for heart thru to beat this|pg||
nt|copeyj: declarer can always make now mike|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes decline finesse and play on spades so another 8 away no doubt|pg||
nt|haans: kibs believe in 4@H easy make |pg||
nt|paulg:  Townsend-Gold have clearly changed the system from their published convention card, which says that 1NT is game forcing with diamonds|pg||
nt|mamos: :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Lead a small @H - and South will play for the @C-finesse|pg||
nt|yusufb: tezcanýn dedigi gibi baþtan 3@s dese þimdi pas gecerken daha rahat olurdu|pg||
nt|tez: ortak buyuk @d verince alttan @s oynarmý?|pg||

nt|haans: true|pg||
nt|shevek: never underlead a queen?  :)|pg||
nt|xenya: seems 11 tricks can be made|pg||
nt|desert: facing a 10-13 hand i would have Xed with the east hand.....|pg||
nt|oliverc: I agree. strange that he's bid 1@H on Board 2, but makes a negative double here|pg||
nt|yuval10: EW not on the same page i believe|pg||
nt|desert: to prevent THIS ;-)|pg||
nt|oliverc: doesn't look that way|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mamos: well predicted Peter |pg||
nt|janhamhurg: spade now|pg||
nt|arvidsson: jag tycker att det är ett svårt läge, men zonerna hade hjort att jag passat i båda fallen|pg||
nt|koksoy: down2  ??|pg||
nt|yuval10: max defense is -3|pg||
nt|yuval10: will be a big swing for Israel either way|pg||
nt|tez: hidayet abi olsa|pg||
pc|s7|nt|rnmalik: Play appears to be simple or it looks, A@H and A@D and small @C to A and KQ@C and pitch @H and let E ruff and 1@S loser.|pg||
nt|copeyj: can claim|pg||
nt|copeyj: AKJ@H pitching two @D losers|pg||
nt|copeyj: and give up @S|pg||
nt|affe82: personligen hade jag inte balanserat i ngn form. lite skräpigt.|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 2 times @s hold-up would make it interesting |pg||
nt|lestergold: now brilliancy needed|pg||
nt|jallerton: are they allowed to vary their system, Paul?|pg||
nt|Gerben42: still isnt a hopeless contract |pg||
nt|desert: East must warn his pd NOT to sacrify......|pg||
pc|hK|pc|h9|nt|pitiful:  looks like 9 tricks|pg||
nt|hedyg: wd|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: now actually its better than 50%|pg||
nt|Gerben42: good guessing in trumps helps|pg||
nt|yuval10: if 2@d is intermediate than E could've bid many other bids - 3@c for instance|pg||
pc|h2|nt|vbman: rehi|pg||
nt|vbman: this will be challenging|pg||
nt|rnmalik: seems so.|pg||
nt|vbman: cash 2 cl ,play the three spot discarding hearts|pg||
nt|copeyj: the Russians stopped in 3NT next door I am told|pg||
nt|h_karluk: now declarer claims, push next board please|pg||
nt|copeyj: 8@C encouraging|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 10@C now?|pg||
nt|lestergold: does thnat show count or the club q|pg||
nt|copeyj: attitude |pg||
nt|copeyj: no need for count with doubleton on display in dummy|pg||
nt|copeyj: Tom will underlead|pg||
nt|lestergold: well there is chance now kill point as jens Auken would say|pg||
nt|copeyj: I am sure|pg||
nt|hedyg: in OR N did not open and then punished his pd for overcalling|pg||
pc|h6|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: or in clubs- but still i guess -1|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|xenya: so far so good|pg||
nt|copeyj: yes|pg||
nt|affe82: squeeze for 11|pg||
nt|henryb:  I think that was wrong: could lead to defeat even with @d 2-2 if trumps 4-0|pg||
pc|sA|nt|lestergold: do u fwel that south was right to run the dim a lead away from q was not too likely|pg||
nt|paulg:  Assuming the change is minor and published to the other countries|pg||
nt|Gerben42: yes|pg||
pc|s8|nt|copeyj: declarer slipped up a little|pg||
nt|copeyj: and townsend made him pay|pg||

pc|s5|nt|copeyj: if the danes had made 3@D would have been 7 to Denmark|pg||
nt|copeyj: as it is it will be 3 to Denmark|pg||
nt|copeyj: so I make it 4 imps saved by the defence|pg||
nt|lestergold: 4 impssaved then|pg||
nt|copeyj: but they all count and i am prepared to be corrected|pg||
nt|lestergold: yes u are right 3d 310 swing just in the 7 imp bracket|pg||

nt|arigun: 2@s ve 3@d anlasilir|pg||
mc|10|nt|paulg:  this would be a minor change, it's just all the photocopying for the NPC or coach that is the hassle|pg||
nt|haans: 2@H Flannery has changed|pg||
nt|andreasw:  a fair overcall tho|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: operator?|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: was that what happenend?|pg||
nt|vugraphzns: player had play the 10sp in place od cl|pg||

nt|xenya: not exactly an exciting set so far|pg||
nt|copeyj: yet another strong @C from Dubinin|pg||
nt|lestergold: well io ccertainly would not raise spades wioth the south hand if thats what pard bid- obviously forcing by unpassed hand|pg||

nt|paulg:  Fallenius about to use Leaping Michaels?|pg||
nt|haans: we have as u in england played Multi for 40 years|pg||
nt|mamos: a heavy 1NT in my opinion with 17 and a five card suit|pg||

nt|affe82: tom -2 i @h.|pg||

nt|sga1: Cold 7@d can he bid that. Shud be possible.|pg||
nt|daman: strong jump shift|pg||

mb|p|nt|oliverc: yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: i would repeat clubs|pg||
nt|copeyj: Gold-Townsend another chance to shine defensively to hold the loss to 2 imps|pg||
nt|haans: that was POKER|pg||
nt|jallerton: easy for players of this level in an uncontested auction, harder when opponents bid|pg||
nt|haans: asked and answered|pg||
nt|paulg:  I wonder how many pairs have discussed strong follow ups to this 4@d bid?|pg||
nt|jallerton: the trouble with 4@d is that it loses the @C suit.  Having passed on 1st round, I prefer to double 2@s|pg||
nt|hedyg: N needs to find a @D lead to hold this to 10 tricks|pg||
nt|henryb:  7N is better|pg||
nt|sga1: or 7NT|pg||
nt|daman: could some form of exclusion help this one?|pg||
nt|tez: rakip zonda biz beyazken dengesiz elle bulaþmak iyidir diyor herkes|pg||
mb|p|nt|shevek: 2@d is some Fit Showing (nonJump)|pg||

nt|Walddk7: Heart, ruffed, diamond to the ace, heart ruff, and @SA|pg||
nt|mamos: but wont matter here |pg||
pc|cK|nt|pelu: Operator: same problem in Board 4|pg||
nt|haans: 2@D must be a raise|pg||
nt|shevek: yes|pg||
nt|vbman: dbl?|pg||
nt|lestergold: but 3@s i agree was optimistic opposite a weak jump at green|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Pushed them to 6, now non-vul 6@D the order of the day:)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: no @H lead-ruff-@D-another @H ruff and @SA.|pg||

nt|mikael_w: ser ut som ett väl hårt 1NT inkliv tycker jag :)|pg||
nt|daman: nah    he's unsheathing Easley|pg||
nt|henryb:  hard to do exclusion in partner's opened suit|pg||
nt|sga1: When simple blackwood is the right answer to reach 7N, why try exclusion here.|pg||
nt|sga1: Although exclusion coud have been right also.|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I don't think 4@s by North on this auction as ERKCB is in anybody's armoury|pg||
pc|c3|nt|vbman: well , u r never served if u just stand and wait|pg||
nt|copeyj: so now I am sure Gromov will look for 4-4 @H fit|pg||
nt|pitiful:  yes maybe but AK is not a good 7 points|pg||
nt|hawe45:  And pd did NOT bid 1 @S|pg||
nt|hedyg: in OR S bid 1@d and 4@H was played by E with a Q@D lead|pg||
nt|Gerben42: EW doing what's right against pairs who mix it up like NS - just play their normal game|pg||
nt|yuval10: perhaps he thought 2@s is forcing, because at the very least his hand worth 3@s|pg||
pc|c4|nt|jallerton: never nice to play 4@h with 7@C cold|pg||
nt|hedyg: wow wd!|pg||

pc|hA|nt|rnmalik: Hi Peter, agree.|pg||

nt|mdgraham: oh wd|pg||
nt|mdgraham: Townsend is defending very well this match|pg||

nt|koksoy: ancak  rakip  renk  sikan  olursa|pg||
pc|h3|nt|copeyj: 2@C was nat FG OR limit raise in @S, 2@D showed 5+@S and the rest was natural|pg||
nt|copeyj: The Russians have stopped safely in 3NT well done |pg||
nt|copeyj: and this is going down if townsend leads one|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but does it ask for that.....|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|copeyj: maybe it didnt|pg||
nt|copeyj: townsend didnt think it did at any rate|pg||
nt|lestergold: if 2@c was natural then it surely did ask for a club|pg||
nt|copeyj: might just say he thinks they have overbid Mike|pg||
nt|pitiful:  i know it's all the rage to open 1NT with the south hand and I understand the problems of the canape strong @c system that n-s play but I am not a fan|pg||
nt|eweber: the easiest way to reach all the runnig scores is via the official website|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|jallerton: West I mean|pg||
nt|haans: yes many in sweden believe that including Fredin|pg||
pc|h8|nt|xenya: well on a @D lead it's 5 or 7|pg||
nt|andersk: looks like -1 here|pg||
nt|tez: ben demezdim..2 as var.belkide batýyorlar|pg||
pc|h5|nt|shevek: that is true|pg||
nt|lestergold: might have thopught that it asked him to lead his suit- this is a well known area of ambiguity ion defence you would have thought they had it sorted|pg||
nt|mdgraham: the natural lead would be a heart one would think....so perhaps double should have the lead directing overtone for clubs  |pg||
nt|mdgraham: difficult|pg||
nt|lestergold: well i expect words will be said later and im not adding any fuel to that fire|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but then, if you think the contract will go down a packet if partner simply leads his suit, it's a bit rough if you can't double because that would ask him to lead something else |pg||
nt|jfaria: even if @d wouldnt behave always 9 tricks via @c |pg||
pc|d2|pg||
nt|arvidsson: nej nu blev det 2 bet|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Oh-no - West can see, that they have an 8-card fit in @H|pg||
nt|koksoy: operator ..  could  you  please  score board 6 ??|pg||
nt|pikonlu: 2 trefl alabilir|pg||
pc|dA|nt|Gerben42: i went through the play - wasnt that clear to guess it - but he made it :)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: the 4@S bid opposite the vuln preempt showed good judgement|pg||

nt|copeyj: not the luckiest of layouts here for 4@S|pg||

nt|mamos: but a loser in each suit so only probaly an imp or so|pg||
nt|hedyg: ok to pass in E for me, even in 3rd seat|pg||
nt|hawe45:  It seems, that the swiss South in OR has guessed the @S-position, maybe 2 IMP waiting|pg||

mb|p|nt|vbman: dumb ol' lebensohl|pg||
nt|copeyj: although perhaps the operator misscored the last board - looks like 11 tricks only?|pg||
nt|pitiful:  2@c relay, 2@s looks like 4@h|pg||
nt|hedyg: and i dont want a @c lead!|pg||
nt|Gerben42: with passed pd, another "weak jump overcall", agree with 2@D|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 2@D over 1@C is annoying for opps|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 3@H fit jump even more so|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: and go down in 4 spade- but now 4 dia will make |pg||
nt|ludewig: 5@D makes after a Club lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzns: player in discussion|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 4@D looks like final contract now|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: no alert i guess|pg||
nt|vugraphzns: yes|pg||
nt|desert: a very difficult board for a natural system....|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: why not the minor suit transfer, for my education:)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  hopefully W lead's a @s:)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: although it may be "general bridge logic" to bid 3@H only with fit, I still think one should alert it|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: if 3 hearts is a fit jump east might bid 3 spades|pg||
nt|arvidsson: eller det sticket får vi ändå, men snyggare|pg||
nt|mikael_w: risk för trumfutspel dock :(|pg||
nt|affe82: det kommer man väl att göra? @c ut?|pg||

nt|vugraphzns: td asking from sweden|pg||
nt|affe82: även med trumf lead hinner försvaret testa aallt för att hitta stölden, väl?|pg||
mb|p|nt|mdgraham: boards like that last one swing hundreds of points - NS bid defensively (they cannot have been expecting to make 3@H) to go one down, which appears no disaster - but EW can't make ...|pg||
nt|mdgraham: vert much either   |pg||
nt|lestergold: what is 2@c?|pg||
nt|copeyj: probably their way of showing an invitational hand with 5(6)@S|pg||

mb|p|nt|xenya: most likely, 2@H was down 1|pg||

nt|ludewig: actualy 3 NT is good|pg||

nt|ady: I think 2@H artificial|pg||
nt|haans: what is leaft of Precision are weak opening bids|pg||
nt|jallerton: trump lead common on this auction as dummy often hits with @c shortness and maybe only 3 trumps|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 3 hearts now- any extras you see in that hand?|pg||
nt|oliverc: great result for Israel in the OR|pg||
mb|3N|nt|lestergold: south has followed the not unreasonable thibn king that a freely bid vulnerable game maybe an ace isnt working and he was right|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Board 7, 5@C -1, @S wrong guess.|pg||
nt|jfaria: that's it|pg||
nt|jfaria: fiendly lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: has pros and cons i admit.... passing or bidding|pg||

pc|s3|nt|ady: I tht 2@H  was a tranfer back to 2@S  which may be on a minumum opening   and a 2@S rebid  invitational  |pg||
nt|copeyj: I would not pass 1@S - the opponents could very easily have a vulnerable game on|pg||
nt|h_karluk: well unless 1@s implies 23+ pass quite normal|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But|pg||
pc|c3|nt|andersk: -1, good result for NS here! As the layout is, 3 NT makes EW|pg||

pc|c7|nt|h_karluk: say they have a game, what can we do pal :)|pg||
nt|copeyj: of course it is unlikely, but the downside of responding is relatively small, where as the upside is big|pg||
nt|ady: anyone know the mweaning of the 2@H rebid?|pg||
pc|c5|pg||
nt|jallerton: the English N/S play 5-card Stayman so South had to transfer out to 2@s and play in the worse 2@s contract|pg||

nt|haans: E has all his cards in other suits|pg||
nt|Gerben42: if anyone then this pair|pg||
nt|affe82: köps i 3@d?|pg||
nt|desert: one can discuss the 3 @D opening bid in 3rd hand of course.....|pg||
nt|koksoy: icerde  5@S  e  zorlanmýs...  burada  4@S  te  kalabilir...|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|rodvenn: han må trumfe seg inn på bordet og spilel stående spar. kaste klvøer. Vest må stjele og er innspilt. må spilel kl opp til K kn|pg||
nt|mamos: great suit  for the Multi|pg||

mb|4S|nt|lestergold: no heartb lead will make ten tricks inpractice|pg||
nt|eweber: would you prefer 31h?|pg||
nt|pitiful:  anyway 4@h by west looks a good shot|pg||
nt|rnmalik: logical contract.|pg||
nt|tez: nafiz 5@h demez inþallah..3@d dbl ýný @s dýþýnda renk istiyor anlarsa|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  no, about the right time here:)|pg||
nt|copeyj: West has opened 1N here|pg||
nt|haans: 2nd opinion: sudi: 5@H is on so sac 6@d not so profitable... Me give opps 5 level|pg||
nt|eweber: 3@h?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No - 3 NT was a normal shot|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: i think its hard to make 6 hearts|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: he doesnt like his hand so much|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 5@D down 2|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: now x would be great|pg||
nt|ludewig: and 6 @S should go down after a club lead, so no slam after all|pg||
mb|p|nt|desert: this will be expensive......|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: Water best remedy:)|pg||

nt|rnmalik: Specs have pointed out that Sweden has more Vps then I mentioned, may the record available with me has not been updated.:)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Interesting hand very easy to go above board.|pg||
nt|henryb:  Jansma's most successful action would have been the "green" card|pg||
nt|andreasw:  nope |pg||
nt|oliverc: indeed|pg||
nt|desert: i would have bid 3 Cl with the West hand hoping to find a fit in a minor......|pg||
pc|d5|nt|andyv:  I wonder how they got the 12th trick|pg||
nt|pelu: no beer for me to day - to morrow morning I am going by car to Oostende :(|pg||
nt|copeyj: 2@H showed 6@S minimum or 16+ with @C|pg||
nt|copeyj: when he continued with 3@h|pg||
nt|h_karluk: seems a good beginning is half a succession|pg||
nt|copeyj: he showed 5-3-1-4 and a good hand|pg||
nt|h_karluk: k ty|pg||
nt|lestergold: hm the hackett vulnerable barrage on the ew/ cards in the open room does not look very sound lucky only one off|pg||
nt|mdgraham: nine toppers|pg||
nt|haans: we take that as it comes|pg||
nt|jfaria: 1nt must be like std now|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|rnmalik: We have a very generous operator.|pg||

nt|henryb:  What was 3@c? |pg||
nt|koksoy: egale|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|lestergold: i mean neither of their buids would have been my choice|pg||
nt|ady: I suppose has some other way of showing 5-3-4-1 good hand|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  not the classical Multi opening, although this time it worked well|pg||
nt|andreasw:  nope:)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @S-lead|pg||
nt|andreasw:  would be the easy way out|pg||
nt|hedyg: not impossible|pg||
nt|koksoy: we   see  EW  play  nt opening strong or  weak  depends on  vulneribily|pg||
pc|d3|nt|rnmalik: This is cursed lead, every time lead K from KQ find AJ:)|pg||
nt|haans: lot of finesses|pg||
nt|mamos: Yes its worked well  |pg||
nt|hedyg: you surely dont want to lead anything else |pg||
nt|hawe45:  No comments - I promise!|pg||
nt|andreasw:  i like to lead a @c or @s on w hand|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|dA|nt|copeyj: which hand are you talking about david - 9?|pg||
nt|mdgraham: ten when @SQ drops|pg||
nt|hedyg: i like to open with the E hand :(|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: cant have south 2 small dia instead of 2 small hearts?, i think there was hesitation after the 5 dia call|pg||
nt|hawe45:  @S 8 is the correct switch now|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 2@C is described as NF Stayman, so 3@C may be F Stayman - CC not really clear|pg||
nt|desert: facing a passed hand 2NT cant be a very good contract......Pd has no hearts, so......:)|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|pelu: Andy : problems with the claim almost every time - we have given up :)|pg||

nt|jallerton: 7@s Very optimistic|pg||
nt|haans: agree but (swede)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: so far EW here can be very happy with their card|pg||
nt|henryb:  6@s is a decent (good) contract) that is unlikely to make|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: I hate singleton K and Q - but still I would open 3@d|pg||
nt|eweber: with the !K in her hand known after playing the Q earlier, @c K was the best she could try|pg||
nt|andreasw:  this is were S should bid 1nt|pg||
nt|dimi: probably EW will try 4 @s|pg||

nt|mikael_w: 2 !!!|pg||

mb|2C|nt|copeyj: 1@D negative from Gromov i expect|pg||
nt|copeyj: on board 10 (just played)|pg||
nt|nyg8:  if everything broke - one can make 7S|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: England are playing 3@H undoubled in the open room|pg||
nt|copeyj: 2 down|pg||
nt|jfaria: "4@s whatever u got"|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Looks like a straight-forward 4 @H here|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Big swing for Germany - the made the slam in the other room|pg||
mb|2S|nt|copeyj: and 9 imps to England (much needed)|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Man har 6 förlorare och fi har bjudit och partnern sagt pass, varför skall man hoppa till 3 då ?'|pg||
mb|p|nt|shevek: 1@d = nat ALWAYS unbalanced|pg||
nt|shevek: 6@d anyone?|pg||
nt|xenya: i like it|pg||
nt|copeyj: 10 sorry|pg||
nt|arvidsson: för att inte ge fi chansen att hitta sin färg|pg||
mb|3N|nt|mdgraham: lots of flaws - singleton black honours, the four hearts....but still tempting|pg||
nt|andyv:  this auction it's tempting for Gromov to bid 3N|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 2 level @s or N fine there|pg||
nt|lestergold: looks like an overboard hand for e/w|pg||
nt|copeyj: I would expect the twins to end in game next door (they play 14-16 NT in this position)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: disciplined partnerships mahy handle it|pg||
nt|lestergold: combined 25 AND NO PLAY FOR 3n|pg||
nt|h_karluk: *may|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: Non Ace@C lead makes 4@S.|pg||
nt|copeyj: combined 24 i think mike|pg||
nt|copeyj: 17 opp 7 isnt it?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 24 i think|pg||
nt|rmb1: Not sure why 1@S alerted.  Card suggests 1@S is nat, <GF|pg||
nt|pitiful:  but a low @c switch initially .....|pg||
nt|hawe45:  East has bad values, no thinking about a slam, not at all|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well tyhen russians have been conservative at the right time cant see the twins being as conservative|pg||
nt|haans: what would 2nt overcall have meant|pg||
nt|rnmalik: @C hook correct and the contract home.|pg||
nt|jallerton: might yet get to 7 after than majestic leap to game|pg||
nt|haans: 6 is enough|pg||
nt|jallerton: East'd double is usually 13-15 balanced|pg||
nt|paulg:  Gold is not passing this, just considering best way forward|pg||
nt|jallerton: West has bid 4@s opposite that|pg||
nt|affe82: med andra hö hade jag haft förstaels för 3. (även över 2@d)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Better to get 420|pg||
mb|p|nt|shevek: I wonder why south didn't cue @ss|pg||
nt|shevek: hearts|pg||
nt|haans: 5-6?|pg||
nt|haans: what did 21Hx show?|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: wont make with a normal dia lead, unless you guess the spade suit|pg||
nt|arvidsson: känsligt kontrakt för ÖV 9 stick kommer det troligen att sluta med (även om försvaret kan beta)|pg||
nt|affe82: ser ut som att detta gar att pilla hem.|pg||
nt|affe82: nja. han kan väl alltid ga hem om han stjäl högt och fiskar med @dT  pa vägen tillbaks?|pg||
nt|arvidsson: spader A sedan mera spader för att stjäla högt och maska ? |pg||
pc|dA|nt|lestergold: sorry only 24|pg||
nt|eweber: y, there you are right, but who would seeing a doubleton in dummy and the chance to overruff in @s?|pg||
nt|henryb:  and less likely by W than by E, as the @h lead is certain|pg||
nt|nyg8:  if the lead is not a H then make he will make 6S|pg||
pc|d4|nt|shevek: 3@d should set the trumps|pg||
nt|copeyj: now here is a hand i specialise in|pg||
nt|copeyj: playing in 3-3 fits|pg||
nt|eweber: 2@c in the German system askes for 4@h|pg||
nt|mdgraham: interesting style - no 4@H cue by West|pg||
pc|d7|nt|pelu: No in practical bridge there are 2 C-losers|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i guess Dubinin draw the big picture and respected captaincy|pg||
nt|paulg:  second double would normally be a strongish takeout|pg||
nt|pitiful:  2@d shows a doubleton @h?|pg||
nt|eweber: 2@d say no|pg||
nt|ludewig: 4@S needs to play Spades for no losers|pg||
nt|affe82: enligt den tidigare diskussionen hade jag dock inte skämtsw för att bjuda 3@s över 3@d. men ni övriga kanske inte haller med?|pg||
nt|arvidsson: nej bjuder man 2 spader har man gjort sitt, tycker man får välja i första varvet|pg||
nt|arvidsson: då jag hade bjudit 3 spader (som troligen är ett rätt dåligt bud)|pg||
nt|arvidsson: troligen kommer Uppmark att spela kl från bordet|pg||
nt|mikael_w: svårt tycker jag, men jag hade aBSOLUT NÖJT MIG MED 2 @S FÖRSTA GÅNGEN, SEDAN OM MAN BJUDER 3 OCKSÅ SÅ BÖRJAR DET JU LUKTA LITE DUBBLINGSFARA NÄR DET SITTER DÅLIGT|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|shevek: they seem to get there anyway|pg||
nt|xenya: slam rates to go down though -- on the surface|pg||
nt|shevek: on a @c lead declarer has to guess @ss|pg||
nt|haans: 5@c AND WAIT|pg||
nt|rodvenn: Norge slapp unna en katastrofe i det andre rommet.Boye doblet 4 hj og islendingene rettet til 4sp|pg||
nt|rodvenn: fortsatt spill 8|pg||
nt|rmb1: 1@S could be 3 @S|pg||
nt|ludewig: North will proabably try to punch dummy with diamonds|pg||
pc|dK|nt|paulg:  the redouble said 'bid your suit'|pg||
nt|jallerton: Oh sorry I am asleep|pg||
nt|haans: ok|pg||
nt|pitiful:  a method close to my heart|pg||
nt|henryb:  no. he would not|pg||
nt|mdgraham: mandatory in some partnerships after 4@C|pg||
pc|d5|nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|shevek: and wait....|pg||
nt|shevek: and wait|pg||
nt|shevek: ok by me, I'm checking emails....|pg||
nt|haans: the more he waits lesss option for S to bid slam|pg||
nt|xenya: declarer will play it carefully and will find out E is likely to have more spades than W, so he will play E for the Queen |pg||
nt|shevek: evil thought Vladimir|pg||
nt|xenya: alas...|pg||
nt|shevek: and wait....|pg||
nt|rnmalik: +1|pg||
nt|jallerton: but East still interested in grand opposite @dK|pg||
pc|dJ|pc|d3|pg||
nt|haans: :( better slams have been seen :)|pg||
nt|ady: 3NY at this posint a good prospect|pg||
nt|lestergold: obiously not pasrtnering david burn then|pg||
pc|d2|nt|copeyj: Bjarnarson has done well to steer it back to @C here|pg||
nt|paulg:  a doublecross from West|pg||
nt|yusufb: su anda 4  durumdayýz 3 le aramýzda sadece 2vp var ama bunun bi onemiþ yok onemli olan ilk 9 giren takýmlarla yaptýmýz maçlar|pg||

pc|h2|nt|xenya: so much for slam|pg||

nt|ady: 3NT|pg||
nt|jallerton: well he can make it if he reads the cards well|pg||
pc|dQ|pg||
nt|vbman: l have to confess l found this score unexpected|pg||
nt|lestergold: this hand has some potential for england because i think 3N is likely to make if bid although it doesnt look that plain sailing|pg||
nt|copeyj: 3@C next door also I am told|pg||
nt|tez: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/runningscores/asp/roundteamsconditstatclassicmod.asp?qtournid=819&qshowflag=1|pg||
pc|cA|nt|haans: will count only 5 hearts|pg||
nt|haans: sry|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|haans: S must have singel @H|pg||
nt|jallerton: he might be forced into playing for @DKxx in North just to get up to 13 tricks|pg||
nt|paulg:  i don't think he can establish clubs unless KQ are tripleton|pg||
nt|paulg:  so I think Jeffrey is probably right|pg||
nt|jallerton: but the timing has to be careful; I'm not surprised West is taking his time here|pg||
nt|paulg:  there is also the problem of 4-1 trumps to cope with|pg||
nt|paulg:  he may have to take two spades first|pg||
nt|haans: must do a lot first|pg||
nt|jallerton: maybe hr has to cash @dJ without drawing any more trumps and then cross ruff the remainder|pg||
nt|jallerton: playing North for s/ton @s and @dKxx|pg||
nt|haans: singel @H at S|pg||
nt|haans: what did xx mean?|pg||
nt|paulg:  XX meant bid your suit, pass would have shown diamonds and presumably interest in 2@d-X|pg||
nt|haans: and 2@H?|pg||
nt|paulg:  2@h would have been natural|pg||
pc|c2|nt|koksoy: he  will  try  for 2 kings  one  is  good  ...  so  8  tricks|pg||
pc|c5|nt|rodvenn: Can west find the spade queen?|pg||
nt|andersk: I doubt he will find it|pg||
nt|Gerben42: if he is playing for 0 losers needs to start with @SQ|pg||
nt|ludewig: now he wishes he had played 3 NT|pg||
nt|dimi: true, he playing for @s 10 doubleton ...|pg||
pc|c3|pg||

nt|koksoy: karo  onörü  cekilince  trefl  ters  tarafa  atýldý...|pg||
mc|10|nt|andersk: since @C 2-2, and as long as south can follow @S, he have 100% safeplay to hook|pg||

nt|pelu: many would just bid 3NT now - u can also tranfer to 3@C and see partners reaction|pg||
nt|rnmalik: another doomed contract.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: NS can make 5@H alright.|pg||
nt|haans: 6@H odds off|pg||
nt|rnmalik: no action boards:)|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: mal sehen---|pg||
nt|oliverc: At the 6-level already and North hasn't even mentioned a suit yet :)|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: sorry|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: i think England will open 1NT next door with the W hand (14-16) then it is unclear where the auction will go |pg||
nt|ady: west may retreat|pg||
nt|copeyj: I wld just bid 1@S but know people who would double|pg||
nt|dimi: NS will try 3nt on this one|pg||
mb|2H|nt|haans: in my book that is natural|pg||
nt|ludewig: try and make|pg||
nt|arvidsson: ok kanske var för att få S att lägga ner kl A :)|pg||
nt|koksoy: this  not a  slemish  set|pg||
nt|mdgraham: very thin double|pg||
mb|p|nt|tez: 3 nt ye parkederiz|pg||
mb|2S|nt|lestergold: rescue transfer to hearts i assume|pg||
nt|haans: no 2 suiter|pg||
nt|hedyg: leaddirecting?|pg||
nt|Gerben42: but the essential point is that you dont knwo your @S goal without knowing if you lose @HK|pg||
nt|arvidsson: får många kloka tips om att N måste ha några HP för sin budgivning|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Ser ut som att 6 @h är ett bra kontrakt, men det kanske kan finnas fällor i det också|pg||
nt|hawe45:  A fair slam here - good chances with @H 3-2|pg||
mb|p|nt|shevek: 1NT=12-14|pg||
nt|xenya: i think it's a very good slam -- almost cold on a non-club lead and 50+% on a club lead|pg||
nt|copeyj: X penalties from Gold - and surely Dubinin will run - i suspect xx shows a 5 card suit somewhere now let's see where they end up|pg||
nt|h_karluk: interesting points : 3 "Jan" at the table (SWN) and Gunther PURKARTHOFER still with Fucik, last year their partners were Arno  Lindermann and Christoph Puersil|pg||
mb|2N|nt|mdgraham: the day when 1NT-3NT is conventional is the day I give up bridge - that's a promise|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Welcome to Paul Orth|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@d is wow|pg||
nt|koksoy: I believe  that;  some  sets  are  slemish.. some  are  dull|pg||
nt|rnmalik: EW can make 4@S, placement of cards very friendly.|pg||
nt|henryb:  even 3@h is one down|pg||
nt|nyg8:  y|pg||
nt|koksoy: öyle  gözüküyor..|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  N shouldn't take @c hook|pg||
nt|pelu: why not?|pg||
mb|3N|nt|andyv:  Kxx in E hand|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Brave bid.|pg||
nt|pauleger: hello|pg||
nt|rnmalik: hello and welcome.|pg||
nt|pauleger: good choices by Kirmse after the very effective 2@s opener|pg||
nt|mdgraham: that should be that|pg||
nt|haans: 48 imps on errors|pg||
nt|hawe45:  The West-hand is fair for a 1 @H-overcall|pg||
nt|andreasw:  so is my grade in german:)|pg||
nt|mikael_w: kommer aldrig gå att få stopp på S med den handen och partnern hoppar|pg||
mb|p|nt|jfaria: E decides for a GF |pg||
nt|h_karluk: @h lead and history|pg||
nt|jallerton: 1@d 4+@h, 1@h usually 11-14 balanced without 4 hearts|pg||
nt|hawe45:  North has maximum for ALL his bids here|pg||
nt|hedyg: more than max|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: correct! u are :)|pg||
nt|lestergold: gold's second doubole musrt be for takeout|pg||
nt|copeyj: normal @C lead for Townsend I would say - and it looks like this is makeable to me|pg||
nt|lestergold: not supisingly townsend passes but this is a better spot than 2h could scramble quite  few tricks here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: no, brave 3@h|pg||
nt|dimi: no road to fail|pg||
nt|mikael_w: 6 @h går nog alltid hen även om det sitter dåligt|pg||
nt|affe82: daligt?|pg||
nt|arvidsson: ja 6@H om det bjuds kommer att gå hem, därför hoppas vi på att de bjuder 6nt :)|pg||
nt|mikael_w: med @d utspel, så kan speföraren ta utspetel och spela @h, men duckar V då och S spelar en @h till så är j|pg||
nt|arvidsson: ruter sitter dåligt, spadern sitter sjukt bra|pg||
nt|mikael_w: går det nog bet om V tar och fortsätter med @h|pg||
nt|arvidsson: nej spader J sitter 3:e|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: but clubs most likely lead|pg||
nt|shevek: yes, played by north better (less likely @c lead)|pg||
nt|copeyj: i think it's normal to bid 3@H|pg||
nt|mamos: The women's championship is still very close   -- about half the field still in touch with the leaders|pg||
nt|rnmalik: E stepped in to rescue NS.|pg||
nt|tez: @s ataktan sonra egale|pg||
pc|d7|nt|andersk: probably 7 tricks|pg||
nt|copeyj: has a little something, 5th @H and no @S wastage opposite presumed shortage|pg||
nt|lestergold: well reckons his q@d working so i think he can at this colour|pg||
nt|jfaria: a @h lead will be devastating|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 1o tricks|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: but germany is far behind now in the match, and i woudnt call that unlucky|pg||
nt|arvidsson: varav det alltid står|pg||
nt|mikael_w: du har bara 3 sak, du kanske sakar en @d och slår en @s-mask|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Singel @d ut så kommer det ofta att gå bet|pg||
pc|d6|nt|rnmalik: But this may not make-imo 4@S x is to play.|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|arvidsson: varför då?|pg||
nt|mikael_w: ja hur hade du spelat efter @d ut ?|pg||
nt|arvidsson: tror inte han kommer att lägga ner några ruter, men visst det kan hända|pg||
nt|mikael_w: det handlar inte om att lägga ner, hur spelar ni efter @d ut ?|pg||
nt|arvidsson: jag stväl på handen spelar hj Q|pg||
nt|affe82: duck. @h. be till gud.|pg||
nt|arvidsson: stjäl |pg||
nt|arvidsson: sedan är det rulltårta :)|pg||
nt|mikael_w: nej det är det inte|pg||
nt|arvidsson: jo det är det 2 ingångar @H K samt @S Q kan stjäla upp rutern om jag vill då|pg||
nt|arvidsson: men som sagt sitter trumfen 4-1 kan det bli jobbigt|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|pauleger: this contract can be set after simply playing 2 rounds of @h|pg||
nt|mdgraham: close though. Pard doesn't guarantee four hearts|pg||
nt|lestergold: but does gurantee 3|pg||
nt|copeyj: very likely to have short @S and thus 3@H|pg||
nt|lestergold: if not wopuld have much stronger hand|pg||
nt|haans: @DJ standard for this pair|pg||
nt|paulg:  on the card?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  No trump-lead this time, Michael|pg||
nt|tez: tabii bilimsel @d ataðýda var..ben @s atak ederdim|pg||
pc|c9|nt|pelu: I owe u 1, Andy|pg||
nt|rodvenn: maybe good for norway as it may be difficult to stop in 2 @h|pg||
nt|rodvenn: for NS|pg||
nt|haans: nope mot that standard|pg||
nt|haans: not|pg||
nt|mikael_w: stjäla upp @d ? skojar du?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  On a @D-lead, you might play a @H to the 10|pg||
pc|c8|nt|andyv:  lol|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and now a @s switch|pg||
nt|jfaria: Paulissen would thank u for the info :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Gert supposed to find it, drums beating|pg||
pc|c3|nt|rmb1: 1NT(X)Pass = forcing to redouble|pg||
nt|arvidsson: jag kan stjäla upp rutern om jag villl, hade jag gjort det ja|pg||
nt|nyg8:  bbad D|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|paulg:  it's not a nice hand to lead from, and you don't want diamonds returned, so it is a reasonable try|pg||
nt|haans: i do not like players that lead to be copied in papers|pg||
nt|arvidsson: lite beroende på vad som händer tidigare när jag spelar hj J |pg||
pc|dT|nt|rodvenn: but only 5 losers for East|pg||
nt|affe82: riskerna är väl: @h A kan ge @d stöld. men mest 4-1 i trumf. annars kan man enligt arvidssons linje dra trumf och ruffa 2@d|pg||
nt|arvidsson: duckar de och jag spelar hj mot K |pg||
nt|mikael_w: så i stick 2 spelar du !q och efter duck även @h J då. men då vet jag inte om du spelat med oddsen|pg||
pc|dK|nt|jfaria: anything works, except @h |pg||
nt|h_karluk: however declarer still far far away to bring it home|pg||
nt|jfaria: @d dont behave|pg||
nt|jfaria: he will need @s|pg||
nt|h_karluk: say behaved|pg||
nt|mamos: dummy is short of entries here|pg||
nt|pitiful:  a double dummy @h 10 lead was the only chance|pg||
nt|mamos: but now declarer is well in control|pg||
pc|d3|pc|d8|pg||
nt|copeyj: Gold can make this if he reads it perfectly, and England in 2@S next door (likely to make)|pg||
nt|copeyj: so some chance for a dbl partscore swing|pg||
nt|arvidsson: jag spelar en liten hj mot K i stick 3, |pg||
nt|mikael_w: ja, men det är oerhört lätt när man ser alla kort, men jag kan nog lova att du inte spelar brickan på bästa sätt om du spelar så|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|mdgraham: I knew it. One of my partners wants to play 1NT-3NT as a minor suit slam try :) |pg||
nt|pelu: the danger for N is to lose to a @S-H and then @S back and @D = 5 losers - no problem with both @S H in East|pg||
nt|jfaria: ther it goes|pg||
nt|haans: 2nd opinion: beboeloek: heart lead maybe better on this hand|pg||
nt|haans: my man :)|pg||
nt|arvidsson: jag tror att det är rätt spelföring Micke|pg||
pc|sA|nt|andyv:  as a spec also pointed out Kxx in W hand also a good reason not take finesse|pg||
nt|henryb:  unless the defense gives away the contract, of course|pg||
pc|s3|nt|rnmalik: nothing does. such a hand.|pg||
nt|koksoy: Denmark  is increasing  pressure  for th 9th chair|pg||
nt|nyg8:  why play C when S can be risky|pg||
nt|nyg8:  S is safe- club is riksy|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|xenya: this, however, is a coffee hand -- which reminds me... brb|pg||
nt|lestergold: now dim club dim and what does north do|pg||
nt|copeyj: can play a number of lines now|pg||
nt|lestergold: al defence can come to now surely are two trump tricks one way or the other|pg||
nt|koksoy: 40-0|pg||
nt|henryb:  either black suit concedes the contract: only @hA and a @h (probably) leads to defeat|pg||
nt|nyg8:  After aH and H can make contract by wining in dummy and play small S.|pg||
nt|daman: all roads lead to +140|pg||
pc|d4|nt|rodvenn: direct losers|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Really bad luck, with this lead, declarer only needs trumps 3-2 and @s-suit fair|pg||
pc|s4|nt|jfaria: next pl|pg||
nt|arvidsson: att spela QJ i hj, sitter hj 3-2 är det matte hemma|pg||
nt|henryb:  yes, but unlikely to make that play|pg||
nt|nyg8:  If S pops up with K then he can throw 2C loosers on sAQ|pg||
pc|d2|nt|h_karluk: i don't know, 2@c fine but..whatever|pg||
nt|arvidsson: ingen kan ta för då får man ingångar att resa rutern|pg||
nt|arvidsson: och duckar de får de på trumf A någon gång|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|copeyj: 8 tricks|pg||
nt|copeyj: and 180 to Russia|pg||
nt|haans: ERROR|pg||
nt|haans: Play right???????|pg||
nt|haans: :)|pg||
nt|arvidsson: åtminstonde jag som är en enkel man hade spelat så|pg||
pc|c4|nt|andersk: cant raise 8 tricks thats the problem|pg||
nt|pauleger: this line succeeds as well|pg||
nt|lestergold: yuip a very unluicky board for england|pg||
nt|h_karluk: aggressive play could be a vital asset of the world's greatest bridge players. many believed to attack in a bold, confident, and determined way, who knows they thing to make a ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: giant leap toward realizing their full potential |pg||
nt|janhamhurg: number 10 still to come- which is a sure --|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cA|nt|tez: el yer baðý kesildi..@d avantajlý gibi gözüküyoordu ama deðil|pg||

pc|cK|nt|eweber: we are watching one of the quickest tables in the room|pg||
pc|c7|nt|hedyg: @H shortness now known in S|pg||
nt|desert: Exciting board.....one kibitzer suggested to play a heart to the 7 first round in 6 @H doubled....;-))|pg||
nt|oliverc: lovely hand|pg||
pc|h4|nt|hedyg: max 2 cards|pg||

nt|sfoxa:  that's not a surprise - 4 professionals at work )))|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|rodvenn: South must take care not to be endplayed|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This board seems toi indicate, thet the two swiss pairs bid too much - in more than one sense of the word(s)|pg||
pc|h3|nt|hedyg: too much or not enough Hans?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  too much and too often this time|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h5|pg||
nt|andersk: and he did|pg||
pc|cT|nt|pauleger: if you compare the lost of imps - its 5 away if Kirmse passed, now 9 away|pg||
nt|copeyj: 7 imps to england - 140+140 = 280|pg||
nt|copeyj: much needed|pg||
mc|10|nt|andersk: @h best now|pg||
nt|mdgraham: yes, wd|pg||

nt|lestergold: 7 is it|pg||
nt|copeyj: I even laid the addition out for u Mike :)|pg||
nt|eweber: following links from the official result page you can reach that one to see what is going on on board 12 at the other tables|pg||
nt|andreasw:  another 7 imp's gained this match is almost over|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Not even Ottmar Hitzfeld would bid 1 @D as West|pg||
nt|andreasw:  slam time|pg||
nt|dimi: hopefully the German soccer team will perform slightly better in a few hours :)|pg||
nt|arvidsson: men intresserad att höra vad som är med oddsen ? |pg||
nt|arvidsson: med ruterutspel?|pg||
nt|mikael_w: men då går du bet när @d uppför sig och @h sitter 4-1|pg||
nt|henryb:  since the contract would be cold on a finesse through the opening bidder|pg||
nt|daman: 4@H game now for NS|pg||
nt|nyg8:  true, but it is an interesting option that rarely happens|pg||
nt|tez: 7@s oluyor ..koz as ruaya vermesek|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|pitiful:  strong @c|pg||
nt|eweber: right, but Sabine and Dany can be slow when interesting hands come up|pg||
nt|hedyg: this is not a 3@h opening|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Yes - but difficult after 1 @H opening by East|pg||
nt|hawe45:  ItÂ´s 1 @H - no more, no less|pg||
nt|Gerben42:  10 : Iceland made 11 tricks in @H|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: they are lucky - they dont play vs iceland|pg||
nt|Gerben42: Germany really needs some good boards if they want at least to be in 2 digits|pg||
nt|ludewig: and another slammish hand|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: if i had 1 bid only it would be 6 clubs:)|pg||
nt|arvidsson: ja absoult, men ruter ut talar väl mer för att rutern sitter snett än att hj gör det ?|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Jag säger inte att jag har facit, bara att jag tror att det kan gå bet med @d utspel om man väljer fel spelsätt|pg||
nt|affe82: eller bada.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Quite normal 3 NT here|pg||
nt|koksoy: this  board could be punishment for Denmark  but Estonia missed a  chance for 5 or 8 hundred|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: both vul and weak NT in action|pg||
nt|lestergold: 15 the deficit and 8 boards to go so eng still has chacne to reverse this|pg||
mb|2N!|nt|andyv:  S hand looks like a 1N opener|pg||
nt|lestergold: deficit|pg||
nt|jfaria: those hands are tricky, 8 hc points and a void... facing 1nt|pg||
nt|dimi: 6@h cannot be beaten|pg||
nt|Gerben42: Elinescu wont like 2@S behind his @SK|pg||
nt|henryb:  and might make even if the @s is off if the same player has 4@s and 3@c|pg||
mb|p|nt|copeyj: will this end in 2@SX e/w? that would not be pleasant for them|pg||
nt|jallerton: the Sweded missed a decent game in the other room|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Ouf - TOO strong for 1 NT|pg||
mb|4S|nt|pelu: Operator - I know it is diff - but dont claim 10 tricks when opp has taken 4 tricks, pl :)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: But you had given up:)|pg||
nt|shevek: bd 10 was not passed in as we thought|pg||
nt|haans: SW other side of screen|pg||
nt|mamos: all these players have lots of medals and championships to their names|pg||
nt|andreasw:  this is he's fault|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Welcome |pg||
nt|janhamhurg: but 6 club is better, but since 2 keycard are missing 6 isnt an option i thk|pg||
nt|arvidsson: väldigt få brickor som är självklara, oftast brukar man finna någon dålig variant att spela på, men finns en anledning varför jag inte spelar utan sitter här och kommenterar|pg||
nt|affe82: med en gynsam @s sits. var väl även linjen med vinst(kasta @c) liten hj. kassaskap? kan fa en giss om maska med @h8 när en hypotetisk E vinner @h k med A..|pg||
nt|koksoy: you  know  1100  is  an  emergency  number in  every  country  so  I told about  800  :)|pg||
nt|nyg8:  and there were some clues as if N hehlp SK, HA, and AK of D he would open 1N|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: duly noted|pg||
nt|jallerton: as have the English|pg||
mb|p|nt|pauleger: i think its some sort of kokish here|pg||
nt|haans: both :)|pg||
nt|pitiful:  they only have 1 schedule match in open today so they replay this pm|pg||
nt|pitiful:  sorry private|pg||
nt|eweber: this is very true, we are watching one of the strongest matches of the whole women tournament|pg||
nt|hawe45:  4 @H is lay-down|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: 4 sp is -1 only|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: or - 2 if a ruff comes|pg||
nt|Gerben42: running scores: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/10Ostend/Results.htm|pg||
nt|arvidsson: men vi glömmer den brickan och spanar på denna intressanta giv|pg||
nt|arvidsson: trots gynsam sit ser 3nt väldigt skakigt ut|pg||
nt|mikael_w: japp :) håller med Arvidsson :) BRB, rökpause|pg||
nt|affe82: westerlund bör som jag lära sig att sitta pa verandan. da behöver man inte ga ifran oavsett begär.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: pass must be forcing byh west i assume|pg||
nt|ady: this time e/w are in difficulties|pg||
nt|copeyj: assume this shows @D and a major|pg||
nt|jfaria: E hand must be limited, otherwise not easy to stop at 2 level|pg||
nt|paulg:  i suppose if you are going to miss the game, then stopping at the one level is optimal|pg||
nt|andreasw:  should be 9 trick's unleass he guess the @h Q|pg||
nt|andreasw:  unless|pg||
nt|dimi: hello Hans and Specs|pg||
pc|d8|nt|h_karluk: i expect similar result by OR|pg||
nt|copeyj: going to get away with it i think - townsend cld pass and collect a nice penalty but not so easy not to bid his 5 card @h suit here|pg||
nt|mdgraham: bet 1NT shows spades|pg||
nt|haans: hard to like @DK|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: sorry always -2|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: bidding clubs 3 times is a miracle to me- sorry|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Magnus Eriksson hade en intressant sak från förra brickan också, stjäl ni utspelet och sedan spelar trumf och sedan stjäl upp @d så måste ni stjäla högt, och då får vär V ett ...|pg||
nt|mikael_w: trumfspel?|pg||
nt|mikael_w: BRB|pg||
nt|koksoy: 10  tricks|pg||
nt|henryb:  they play 14+ 1NT?|pg||
nt|tez: bizimkiler kaðýdýn hakkýný vermek için 5 ede gelseler sorun yok|pg||
nt|koksoy: macýn  tansiyonu  düstü..|pg||
pc|dA|nt|andyv:  not sure why the 2@h raise|pg||
nt|jfaria: told it showed 11-13 ty kib :)|pg||
nt|nyg8:  and the Q or J of clubs|pg||
pc|d2|nt|pelu: 1@C = 12-14 or 18-19 Ball., or natural @C|pg||
nt|shevek: guess south opened 1NT and played there|pg||
nt|jallerton: at least the Swedes tried to get to game|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  my team has its debuit here, but our first victory was vs.England - 16 to 14 - sensation for us|pg||
nt|ludewig: South shows some club support, he did not bid 4@H immediately|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: a kibitz says pass over 4 spade would have been forcing- im not so sure about that|pg||
nt|henryb:  if 15-17, then North could have no club honor|pg||
nt|henryb:  or an unbalanced hand|pg||
nt|nyg8:  that was my point - am jsut saying there were some clues the S had SK|pg||
nt|henryb:  Perverse Flannery opener|pg||
nt|henryb:  5=4 in majors rather than 4=5|pg||
nt|henryb:  presumably they canape, and reverses show extras|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 5+@S, 4+@h, 8-14 hcp. Quite a wide range|pg||
nt|nyg8:  that sounds right. E has now tough decision|pg||
nt|nyg8:  going up with the A will set up 2C tricks for D discard|pg||
nt|mdgraham: 3NT showed 5422 maximum|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|rnmalik: ace less 12. |pg||
nt|hawe45:  He would open 1 NT also wit a 4-card @D - and here he has two more tricks|pg||
nt|rnmalik: so found the fit, afterx.|pg||
pc|s2|nt|shevek: unsuccessfully|pg||
nt|pauleger: you will make 4@s although you have 3 loosers in @h and @c, because you wont finesse against the dangerous opponent|pg||
nt|copeyj: dubinin made a good decision on this deal to show a 2 suiter|pg||
nt|ady: looks like n/s will take their vuln game|pg||
nt|lestergold: 3N looks a better spot than 4H|pg||
nt|h_karluk: with 2 hcp?|pg||
nt|arvidsson: hm ett bra kontrakt landade de i, vågar vi hoppas på spader ut och sedan hj till A och mera hj ? så det blir en snabb resa tillö hemgång|pg||
nt|affe82: visst @h A som det sitter. det blir jobbigt om w startade med 9xxx och E med Asingel.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Open 1 @D and jump to 2 NT|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Hello|pg||
nt|henryb:  and ducking might lose the @cA if declarer has @dKQx|pg||
pc|sT|nt|oliverc: layout favouring NS here. going to be effectively forced into the winning line|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|shevek: the cards are not very friendly here|pg||
nt|haans: 2@S must have been spades + clubs Häxan in sweden |pg||
nt|copeyj: yes although both probably make|pg||
nt|lestergold: 6 on a non club lead|pg||
nt|mamos: think this is coffee hand :)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 5@CX+1 is more than slam|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 1400 vs 1370|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: that scores well no sos on level 5:)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: XX I mean|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 5@CXX+1 , without redouble slam is more|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: is north thinking? if he bids i leave:)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: north and east are on 1 side - operator enters two bids at the time|pg||
nt|ludewig: the operator puts in bids for N and E at the same time, so East is thinking I think|pg||
nt|dimi: E will not feel comfortable|pg||
nt|Gerben42: East just showed support in an auction in which opps are strong |pg||
nt|vugraphzns: N is thinking|pg||
nt|nyg8:  also true. Tough guess|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|arvidsson: ska fi spela massa trumf på oss|pg||

nt|xenya: again, the way the play was shown here, the result should be 2 off, not 3 |pg||
nt|haans: when do you have a solid suit?|pg||
nt|shevek: back to part scores....|pg||
nt|haans: or not|pg||
nt|rodvenn: interesting hand|pg||
nt|rodvenn: 6 @d is rasonable contract|pg||
nt|andersk: 3 @S or 4@S overcall|pg||
nt|rodvenn: reasonable|pg||
nt|rodvenn: but needs 2 finesses|pg||
nt|rodvenn: if eager bidding, everybody may bid too high for safety|pg||
nt|andersk: 6@D can be set with a @C ruff|pg||
nt|rodvenn: and then norway must find club ruff against 6 @d|pg||
nt|rodvenn: but nomrla opening is 1@d with East|pg||
nt|rodvenn: then 2 of @s lead will be lavinthal for club ruff|pg||
nt|pauleger: so he took the best line not knowing @hs behave|pg||
nt|pauleger: 6NT here|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Sorry for miscounting, 1130 was never in question, but 930 by playing @C earlier|pg||
nt|nyg8:  i the SA and then double finess in H is a better play|pg||
nt|nyg8:  i would havr played the SA and then double finessed H|pg||
nt|vugraphzns: toilet break for 3 players|pg||
nt|nyg8:  3N will be bid but not make if N unblocks the cQ and does not lead S|pg||
nt|nyg8:  this is an interesting hand. One assumes that W will be declare|pg||
nt|henryb:  bye all. Work calls|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: 3nt ?|pg||
nt|rodvenn: yes. here we go!|pg||
nt|andersk: I have a feeling that many NS will make 4 @S|pg||
nt|rodvenn: how much shd South bid?|pg||
nt|eweber: looking back to board 6 and 8, the two swings, in both cases the English were one of two teams in the whole women tournament to earn these imps, congratulations!|pg||
nt|oliverc: You're az tempo behind and so have to play for QX@C to get an entry to Dummy to|pg||
nt|oliverc: hook the Diamonds|pg||
mb|2C!|nt|copeyj: yet another big @C for Dubinin - amazing number in one set|pg||
nt|jallerton: yes, some of us have made +5 too!|pg||
nt|andreasw:  another slam|pg||
nt|affe82: claimade han inte 10?|pg||
nt|nyg8:  on a passived D lead and unblock of cQ, S gains an entry in C and they can take 4S and a C|pg||
mb|d|nt|haans: time to bid Fredin|pg||
nt|jallerton: 3@s should show a reasonable hand here as borderline hands can pass and bid 3@s on next round|pg||
nt|jallerton: Justin Hackett chose 3@s after same start to auction|pg||
nt|haans: he have cards for 3@S|pg||
nt|jallerton: perhaps he is considering 2NT|pg||
nt|haans: pass now bid 3@S later no no no|pg||
nt|paulg:  the hand is not so great, three small diamonds, heart poorly placed ... 3@s looks normal|pg||
nt|pitiful:  2@d @s and another|pg||
nt|mamos: 10-12|pg||
nt|hedyg: multi 2@d|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 1@C can be 2|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Aj då. nu ser vi att 6 @h gick en bet vid andra bordet :( men det berodde väl mest på att dom fick den på fel hand|pg||
nt|oliverc: Chance for Israel here|pg||
nt|pikonlu: acik odada 2nt oynanýyor|pg||
mb|2D!|nt|shevek: far from it|pg||
nt|Gerben42: should have said "safe" rather than safe |pg||
nt|hawe45:  More - no-swing-boards - 10 or 11 tricks in 4 @H|pg||
nt|daman: the @H suit has some promise|pg||
nt|nyg8:  but bery hard defence|pg||
mb|4C|nt|pelu: :(:(|pg||
nt|rodvenn: pass. inviteing 6?|pg||
nt|andersk: a safe 5@S from Ekren|pg||
nt|andersk: I suppose pass should be invite|pg||
nt|rodvenn: but this is not a clear forcing pass situation?|pg||
nt|rodvenn: nobody vulnerable|pg||
nt|andersk: I think it is clear|pg||
nt|haans: take out x had been better that 3nt|pg||
nt|arvidsson: ja blev svårare från andra handen med kl genom AQ|pg||
nt|koksoy: 2@C  demekki  biraz  daha  fazla  da  olabiliyormus ...  ya  da  yanlýs  saydý|pg||
nt|tez: 5 el dýþarý|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodvenn: no forcing bids from EW|pg||
nt|rodvenn: why do you think it is clear? 4 spades may be a strong hand|pg||
nt|andersk: what is worse case, to pay out 650 instead of 450|pg||
nt|rnmalik: how would they bid, lets see.|pg||
nt|pauleger: 6NT played in the open room|pg||
nt|rnmalik: J@D dropping makeable contract 6NT.|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 5@D+4@S+2@H+1@C=12.|pg||
mb|p|nt|rnmalik: W thinking 6 or 7. 4@C RKC imo.|pg||
nt|haans: but all bids have a cost|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: hard to reach a club contract- weired x here, their style i thk to x with 15 +|pg||
nt|rnmalik: slam time, 6@H for NS, lose 1@D only. K@C rightly placed but should not be bid.|pg||
mb|d|nt|rnmalik: Correctly pointed out 7 covered by 8, would have a different story.|pg||
nt|nyg8:  unfortuntately, H lead sets up 4H tricks|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodvenn: ok. let us see if the 2 of @s comes as i predicted|pg||
nt|andersk: looks like EW agrees that it was forceing.....sometime when opo is agressive....you just have to keep agreements|pg||
nt|rodvenn: peaple have different agrrements as to what is forcing pass sit|pg||
nt|rodvenn: Ingmarsson probably had a good agreement and could pass|pg||
nt|rmb1: 1@S not alerted this time :)|pg||
nt|copeyj: the 6th|pg||
nt|ady: part score only   |pg||
nt|h_karluk: i expect 41s|pg||
nt|haans: inn in spades low dim|pg||
nt|h_karluk: seems Fucik and Gunther have to find another swing to win, so far Jan and Gert slowly slowly approach|pg||
nt|rnmalik: been|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: oh i see:)|pg||
nt|affe82: men den sista 5an maste vara en felscoring. tror det star 34-24, väl?|pg||
nt|oliverc: wd|pg||
nt|tez: konuþur bence|pg||
nt|pikonlu: nefesler tutuldu|pg||
nt|tez: 4@s der|pg||
nt|koksoy: 2@D  ne  demek  acaba??|pg||
mb|p|nt|pauleger: 4@d: i dont like to play slam|pg||
nt|lestergold: any black suit part score looks ok|pg||
nt|arvidsson: jag är inne på din linje fredrik borde vara 24-24|pg||
nt|arvidsson: 34-24|pg||
mb|p|nt|pelu: in modern bridge it is imp0ossible to find a @C-fit :) - bidding @C- never mean @Cs :)|pg||
nt|andyv:  why is it when you decide to open a hand like E's, you always end up in 2NT?|pg||
nt|andersk: I think pass must be an invite against any "real" 5@D and no invite against a save 5@D bid|pg||
nt|rodvenn: now Ekren will not find the club shift i think|pg||
nt|pauleger: rest: answering RKCB|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 4@s|pg||
nt|lestergold: lousy contract and a shortage of entries to fimnesse dims twice|pg||
nt|copeyj: as does a NT partial i think|pg||
nt|ady: 4@S too high  unless a diamond lead|pg||
nt|h_karluk: with 18 and 5134 i cannot imagine a partscore|pg||
nt|koksoy: fena..|pg||
pc|hA|nt|haans: an easy make|pg||
nt|jfaria: this time 1@c is what it most often is : weak bal|pg||
nt|dimi: EW can make 4@h if they get everything right|pg||
nt|hawe45:  They need nothing right - at least  10 tricks|pg||
pc|h5|nt|shevek: with the black aces in the right place, this will make|pg||
nt|hedyg: now 3NT?|pg||
nt|hedyg: as in OR|pg||
nt|mikael_w: bra spelat av S som lägger @s K här :)|pg||
nt|tez: eldeki bir keklik çalýlýklardaki iki keklikten iyidir dedi|pg||
pc|h6|nt|h_karluk: spots decent worths to push|pg||
nt|lestergold: clubs could make a lot of tricks witgh the two three three breaks|pg||
nt|h_karluk: and both sides were nonvul|pg||
nt|ady: can make 11 tricks in clubs without a heart lead  |pg||
nt|haans: odd for lead from A|pg||
nt|haans: harder to lead from Q|pg||
nt|rnmalik: now it will make. K@D the best chance.|pg||
nt|haans: here a big difference from MP|pg||
nt|haans: lead from Q as sort of psyche|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  with bidding suggested @d lead, declarer has little chance|pg||
nt|eweber: was there a misunderstanding?|pg||
nt|pitiful:  lots of bidding here|pg||
nt|mamos: defence has at least one mor chance to find Diamond tricks|pg||
nt|pitiful:  I expect north did not mean 3@h as invite|pg||
nt|eweber: seeing the North hand I would assume 3@h was meant as not inv opposite a 10-12|pg||
nt|pitiful:  probably thinks 3@d is available as game try|pg||
nt|nyg8:  but that is still on 8 tricks|pg||
nt|nyg8:  lets see.|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|lestergold: any rate nice safe spot|pg||
nt|nyg8:  hmm. lets see if they find the magic defence|pg||
nt|mdgraham: if West plays ace and a club he can duck when the queen appears...assuming North doesn't dump it under the ace  |pg||
nt|pikonlu: 2 iceri ile kurtarýrak yine iyi|pg||
pc|hK|nt|mamos: do we know what double showed?|pg||
nt|dimi: doctores are not that brave today|pg||
pc|h9|nt|xenya: the score that we see on our screens should be ignored -- too many errors -- see board 7, for instance|pg||
nt|shevek: hmmmm|pg||
nt|jfaria: no way to loose 6 tricks|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  or 2@s - if @s suit is known|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Allt för att ge sken av att han har 2 st @h så att V skall ducka när @h spelas mot bordet|pg||
nt|tez: evet..koz koz oynarlarsa|pg||
pc|h8|nt|hedyg: i assume they dont play lebensohl here after the double|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Men denna gången spelar det ingen roll när V har ALLT i @h|pg||
nt|affe82: bra offring ock|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|h_karluk: @S j now and @h hook needed for the jack, rest cake and walk|pg||
nt|jfaria: y, extra trick depends on handling @h|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so NS gets a @s, a @h and 2 @d|pg||
pc|h3|nt|hedyg: else N should have continued|pg||
nt|nyg8:  that was the point before. N must unblock the cQ to give S and entry|pg||
nt|desert: i have to leave...have fun and bye|pg||
nt|koksoy: koz  defansý  gelirse  2 iceri  imkansýz|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|pelu: and 3@C over 2NT prob forcing - so thats not an option|pg||
nt|pitiful:  yes 2@s as well|pg||
nt|pitiful:  :)|pg||

nt|janhamhurg: its hard to play 3 matches a day- against tough opponents- so you lose concentration sometimes|pg||
pc|d9|nt|pelu: in the "good old days" - before 1NT F1 - u could bid 2@C in East|pg||

nt|haans: and how many deals until you found out?|pg||
nt|pauleger: unfortunately i have to mention, that he took the best line in @d|pg||
nt|pauleger: the book will say cash one top@d and then finesse|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Against 6NT in OR @S was led and E played AK@D and made the contract.|pg||
nt|haans: 4 down to equal score|pg||
nt|eweber: making this incredible 4@h will bring in some more!|pg||
nt|affe82: missade 44an i @h|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodvenn: puppet|pg||
nt|jallerton: dyou agree with South's 2nd pass?|pg||
nt|Gerben42: showing @S or @C and @D I guess :)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  200 % - wo wohnst Du (ruhig, Ich komme nicht...?)|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Sorry, private|pg||
nt|hawe45:  What does 3 @D mean - with so good cards?|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: surprised to watch off-beat weak bicolor opening|pg||
nt|copeyj: pretty sure it is cold on @C lead mike.. @S to A, ruff, @D to Q, ruff @S, @H to A, ruff @S, cross to @D and pitch @C|pg||
nt|paulg:  i would definitely bid|pg||
nt|haans: to much in @D|pg||
nt|paulg:  but that is probably why I'm commentating|pg||
pc|s7|nt|shevek: half way!|pg||
nt|shevek: anyway, past midnight here, work tomorrow :(|pg||
nt|shevek: have fun everyone|pg||
nt|haans: jump to game with minimim hand|pg||
nt|shevek: thanks and I'll find out the REAL score tomorrow :)|pg||
nt|rodvenn: showing 5 spades i guess|pg||
nt|ady: 2NT   leb?|pg||
nt|lestergold: leb?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: over x not|pg||
nt|jallerton: no, Jason Hackett is playing, not commentating.  He bid 1@h|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 6@D = pass with minors, bid 6@S otherwise|pg||
nt|arvidsson: men lätt hänt att det slinker hem i 4 spader|pg||
nt|affe82: tack eric. alltid med aom en räddare.|pg||
nt|nyg8:  1 light|pg||
nt|yusufb: geri alma felan yokmu|pg||
nt|phantoma: herhalde 2 renkli gosterdi salvo ve unutuldu |pg||
pc|s2|nt|haans: Bye Nicoleat seen you again|pg||
nt|shevek: bye now|pg||
nt|shevek: thx Hans and Vladimir|pg||
nt|haans: Nicoleta|pg||
nt|xenya: bye Nicoleta, thanks|pg||
nt|h_karluk: as a passed|pg||
nt|hawe45:  What would 2 @S mean after 2 @H?|pg||
nt|Gerben42: it all makes sense now, in a crazy way|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: great lead!|pg||
nt|pikonlu: 4kor -1'dense bu daha iyi bir skor|pg||
nt|aydinu: mahalesef öbür masada 4 kör yapýldý|pg||
pc|sA|nt|andyv:  although stiff Aces are not a favorite to show as splinters|pg||
nt|lestergold: what then?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: that's the question|pg||
nt|ady: 3@D  I would think is a break  showing good clubs|pg||
nt|andreasw:  my guess is to stand|pg||
nt|hedyg:  7 @ss no interest any other suit|pg||
nt|Gerben42: bad timing for the agressive move by W|pg||
nt|ludewig: over 1@S from S nobody would bid less than 4 or maybe 5NT|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|pelu: 3@D look like and overbid, 1@H from N could be very weak|pg||
nt|rmb1: 2@S used to be a bad preempt in any suit.  Do they still play that?  It is brown sticker, is it allowed?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: seems just a seam in their sys|pg||
nt|h_karluk: brown supposedly allowed|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Ah - I see...|pg||
pc|hK|nt|andersk: 2 key's missing, should stop in 5@S|pg||
nt|lestergold: in some nbooks its simply a minimum 1 @s opener|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i guess even red stickers|pg||
nt|ady: west baled out as soon as possible|pg||
nt|hedyg: something like that|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Ah - East also bids West cards - I see|pg||
nt|mdgraham: can you confirm result on14, Thierry? |pg||
nt|nyg8:  why not X 3S?|pg||
pc|hA|nt|paulg:  a lot is down to style too ... would Fredin double if the ace of diamonds were the ace of spades?|pg||
nt|mamos: Its useful to play 2@S as natural here after t/o double and South's 1@S|pg||
pc|h7|nt|andyv:  not a favorite to make|pg||
nt|pelu: but there are 10 tricks on cross-ruff|pg||
nt|andyv:  I see 9|pg||
nt|pelu: - oh wrong calculation - lets try again|pg||
nt|xenya: N must be disgusted to see the singleton @D is the Ace|pg||
nt|pelu: give S @CA and a fine game|pg||
nt|andyv:  hi Vladimir|pg||
nt|mdgraham: a friend of mine comments that a trump lead would defeat this  - and I think he is right|pg||
nt|xenya: hello Andy -- and everyone|pg||
nt|mdgraham: but v diff to find a trump from Qx  |pg||
nt|rnmalik: We are at Board 15, any idea about the score?|pg||
nt|andersk: I dont understand 5@D>, maybe 4@D is trelde?|pg||
nt|lestergold: can t cross to the second dim because of the 9 dims doubleton q was only dimn higher  in dummy|pg||
nt|copeyj: 3@D in townsend's hand|pg||
nt|jallerton: at "red" opposite a passed partner?  I suspect not|pg||
nt|sfoxa:  agree. S can bid @s as psychic, having good @d fit (if N's opening shows @d)|pg||
nt|mamos: declarer has work to do|pg||
nt|hawe45:  The ending of thos match will be very bad for Slovakia - very expensive, and Germany needs it|pg||
nt|hawe45:  With such a good hand, West should - having passed - bid 3 @H|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
nt|xenya: interestingly, 4@H could be beaten on the lead of a SMALL spade|pg||
nt|haans: as kibs say EW took+ 200 at or so ...|pg||
nt|mikael_w: det här ser ut som ett sterilt kontrakt, när @h sitter så här|pg||
pc|c5|nt|rodvenn: so what is 5 @d?|pg||
nt|Gerben42: psychologically +1000 +800 will do the Germans well|pg||
nt|MolvaM: neyseki zonda deðil|pg||
pc|c6|nt|haans: let them count to tired|pg||
nt|eweber: Heather must know that she is playing against 4 trumps in the South hand now|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: but its hard to stop below 5 clubs- so the gain might be just 300|pg||
nt|Gerben42: in std system the auction might go: 1@S (2NT) pass (3@D) ; 3@H (4@C) Dbl end|pg||
pc|c9|nt|pelu: no running score - no results from Op - so ...........:(:(|pg||
nt|rodvenn: ok now a lightner double?|pg||
nt|andersk: does he beleve 4 key's?|pg||
nt|rodvenn: 4 @d natural?|pg||
nt|andersk: 5@C 03 5@D 14 and @D K?|pg||
nt|andersk: then they will bid 7|pg||
nt|copeyj: cash two rounds @D and cross with third|pg||
nt|lestergold: well this unofrtunately is a bridge or two too far even 1n was in danger as cards are spitting here|pg||
nt|koksoy: coservative  style  of  N if  he  has  responded  with  5 points  they  will  reach better 3@C contract|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|lestergold: east may have to drop tye stiff HK with no obvious entries tov finesse the heart|pg||
nt|arvidsson: ja 10 enkla kommer det nog att bli|pg||
pc|c3|nt|janhamhurg: not with 7-6 gerben!|pg||
nt|Gerben42: bidding 4@C voluntarily on this auction surely shows my hand with pd promising nothing|pg||
nt|ludewig: the other table is in 5D with S to bid (after 1Club - 4NT)|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: now a spade is best|pg||
pc|c4|nt|lestergold: anolther swin g to denmark undoubetdly|pg||
nt|lestergold: Noty convinced Townsend had an acceptance of the invite|pg||
nt|hedyg: why 10@c?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Why not?|pg||
pc|cT|nt|eweber: trying for a cross ruff is the logical consequence|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Has the 9 himself|pg||
nt|hedyg: exactly!|pg||
nt|MolvaM: sadece 7 imp|pg||
pc|cK|pg||
nt|andersk: this looks strange|pg||
nt|hedyg: why not allow opps to make a mistake and play A@c?|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: might be - 5 now|pg||
nt|MolvaM: zonda olsaydýk 11 verecektik|pg||
pc|h8|nt|xenya: then, when E gets in with a @SK, he plays a club --curtains|pg||
nt|andersk: I have never seen top players bid 5@D before with 2 key's, must be something we dont know|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|andyv:  gromov reluctant to lead @ss still|pg||
nt|pauleger: because some specs tell me a different thing, maybe have a look here|pg||
nt|lestergold: not great when yiour five card suit is to the 8 spot|pg||
nt|mamos: this is a good line with @CK dropping in three|pg||
nt|pikonlu: yada 4kore batsalardý 10|pg||
pc|s3|nt|pauleger: http://www.bridgehands.com/S/Suit_Combination_1.htm|pg||
nt|ady: might have been more difficult and exiting if north had raised to 3@S|pg||
nt|lestergold: still understandable when u feel u have to push for imps usually resuolts in even bigger loss|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Efterssom Björn Fallenius är här inne och tittar nu också så passar vi naturligtvis på att gratulera till mycket bra spel såhär långt :)|pg||
nt|arvidsson: ja ser väldigt stabilt ut, tur man han med och lägga en liten slant på betfair|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|lestergold: 8@h reverse attitude i assume|pg||
nt|copeyj: yes they play standard carding but rev att first discard|pg||
nt|h_karluk: last 5 boards always could cause traumatic results, pressure rise|pg||
nt|rmb1: On up-to-date convention card: 2@S = 8-13 5@S + 4+@C|pg||
nt|copeyj: that is correct|pg||
nt|copeyj: they used to play it as something else|pg||
nt|copeyj: but changed fairly recently|pg||
nt|lestergold: in that case that explains townsend's choice|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i don't know what they call in England, in USA 'tartan' bicolors - weak 5-5, long long years ago was popular, nowadays very rare to see|pg||
nt|copeyj: this tool eliminates a problem hand given their transfer structure over 1@S-1N|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|Gerben42: this hand is a trap for all EW|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: all clear now- so he will play a dia|pg||
nt|ludewig: same contract in the other room|pg||
pc|s4|nt|eweber: without NS auction one would probably have tried finessing in @d|pg||
nt|Gerben42: esp. after strong @C from S, West will be motivated to push higher|pg||
nt|Gerben42: so far scores on  15 range from 1100 NS to 1700 EW|pg||
nt|janhamhurg: perfect defence will give germany some needed imps|pg||
nt|Gerben42: make that +2200 to -1700|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h9|pg||
nt|haans: thats not low spade lead|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 6@Dxx -5 until 6@Sx-6|pg||
pc|s9|nt|paulg:  i think it is definitely a hand worth looking at closely ... how often will balancing be right|pg||
pc|sT|nt|haans: yes it was|pg||
nt|mdgraham: I guess you don't like to hang in 2NT when there's a sniff of game, and @SK10x must have looked good   |pg||
nt|paulg:  is this layout almost pre-destined?|pg||
pc|sQ|nt|h_karluk: probably|pg||
pc|s5|pg||
nt|haans: do not balance in long in their suit = p have no points|pg||
nt|tez: son 6 bordta sayý almadýk:(|pg||
mc|10|nt|nyg8:  poot D, ruff the C, cash the S and then he looses a H as well|pg||

nt|lestergold: granny on a finegle|pg||
nt|paulg:  meanwhile Sweden are recovering at a pace that could lead to a win|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: 50-50? then good:)|pg||
nt|mamos: not what South wanted to hear|pg||

nt|lestergold: ordinary mortals in 6 of course|pg||
nt|jfaria: crossed voids in EW but no time to tell |pg||
nt|haans: dirty 2nt|pg||
nt|jallerton: West has an awkward hand playing strong NT.  What should he rebid?|pg||
nt|haans: 1nt my choice but see u point|pg||
nt|jallerton: weak NT players would rebid 1NT and say "what is the problem?"|pg||
nt|haans: yep|pg||
nt|paulg:  i think 2NT is fine when partner has shown values|pg||
nt|haans: weak nt for pairs |pg||
nt|sfoxa:  but disciplinied pass followed...|pg||
mb|4N|nt|Gerben42: reward for a most quiet auction goes to Jansma - Paulissen|pg||

nt|nyg8:  perfect D leads to 11 tricks for EW but hard to see that|pg||

nt|MolvaM: zorlu minörler olarak aldý herhalde|pg||
nt|koksoy: 4 nt  ne  demek  acaba??|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: well being an english commentator im not allowed bias or have fabtasies about the twions bidding 7 and the ussians bidding 6|pg||
nt|copeyj: wonder if this might be a 6 keycard situation for some pairs|pg||
nt|vasmar: Good evening all|pg||
nt|h_karluk: welcome to Vassilis Virvidakis|pg||
nt|paulg:  the diamond break will kill this, even on a low spade lead|pg||
nt|jallerton: South did very well to make 1NT on the other room|pg||
nt|vugraphzns: Thank you to all |pg||
nt|dimi: 12 imps, nice |pg||
nt|Gerben42: 1@S (2NT) p (p); 3@H (4@C) X end - 300|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Ouf - rebid of J 7 5 3 2 - call a doctor|pg||
mb|p|nt|h_karluk: for slam you do not need @h hook, for grandslam you need and it works|pg||
nt|haans: 1nt less underbid that 2nt is overbid|pg||
nt|mikael_w: enkel att bjuda, men skall spelas hem också :)|pg||
nt|arvidsson: svårigheterna är att visa upp singel ruter och bra spader|pg||
nt|mikael_w: krävs väl rättgiss i @h|pg||
nt|hawe45:  West should naturally bid 2 @D|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  2@h the extent of this hand|pg||
nt|rodvenn: Usually Norway bids these Norwegian slams|pg||
nt|tez: @h atak edilirse 7 oynayýp yapar mýyýz?yerden @s vale oynayarak:)|pg||
pc|sT|nt|pelu: some would X in N in 3. round NS easy make 9 tricks i minor|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so for slam that's perfect, for grandslam 50-50|pg||
nt|haans: 1nt 11-13 |pg||
nt|jfaria: wonder how many EW will have the guts to bid ...|pg||
nt|rnmalik: Hi|pg||
nt|paulg:  South's silence over the double was heard by Fredin|pg||
nt|arvidsson: att spela hem denna tror jag de klarar|pg||
nt|arvidsson: nej de kastar en hj på kl|pg||
nt|tez: diyecektimki|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|h_karluk: given layout everything on the right spot|pg||
nt|jfaria: hi|pg||
nt|haans: lead going for blood|pg||
nt|toniemme: qui dopo attacco a @D è più fatrtibile il gioco di sorpasso a @C dato che il mancato intervento di sud farà piazzare al giocante il k@C in nord..|pg||
pc|sK|nt|rnmalik: True pass from N looked unreal.|pg||
nt|arvidsson: krävs uttrumfning|pg||
pc|sA|pg||
nt|pelu: need to find the @s-ruff to defeat 2@h|pg||
nt|xenya: the 2@H bid has proved rather fortunate here|pg||
nt|andyv:  certainly the vul is right|pg||
nt|pelu: and if partner bid @S then he has played on 4-3 before :)|pg||
nt|mikael_w: oppps, såg inte att det var AK på bordet :)|pg||
pc|cA|nt|rmb1: We can't tell if @HK is a key card,|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i hope you are back to home from office :)|pg||
nt|koksoy: 2  ciftimizde   güzel  oynuyor  demistim  nazarým  degdi..|pg||
pc|h5|nt|copeyj: if 3@h showed 5+@S (as is fairly likely) then 4N is either 6 keycard bwood or keycard for @S imo|pg||
nt|jallerton: was South close to a double of 3NT?|pg||
nt|paulg:  opposite a non-vulnerable Fredin overcall? Probably not.|pg||
nt|jallerton: he has all the suits stopped and can even supply a spade honour if partner leads his suit|pg||
nt|eweber: and an unlucky lead|pg||
nt|hawe45:  And a @D|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 6 yapabilirse anca egale edebilecek|pg||
pc|c4|nt|h_karluk: or just ask K and roll the dice - worst scenario|pg||
nt|copeyj: and judging by response id say just kc for @S|pg||
nt|haans: Fallenius are sitting asking "were is 2 down"|pg||
nt|jallerton: but I agree that his does depend on partner;s style of overcalls to an extent|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|rmb1: East knows West can't have enough for grand, given limited 1@D opening|pg||
nt|copeyj: england in 7@S next door|pg||
nt|daman: -2   but they should make at least 3@S EW|pg||
pc|c7|nt|h_karluk: let me visit and brb|pg||
nt|lestergold: we are not allowed to show any pleasure Simon at that foprtuitous result|pg||
nt|vasmar: not yet :(|pg||
nt|h_karluk: oh ok, time for a deep finesse in @d suit? :)|pg||
nt|toniemme: mariani maschera la Dama..|pg||

nt|rnmalik: such an action hand-one bid and over.|pg||

nt|toniemme: 4@C 4@S 1ruf and 1@H|pg||

mb|1C!|nt|rnmalik: indeed-vul 3@H means something and E passed 4@C with that hand.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: oh yes they are in 7|pg||
nt|copeyj: Jason Hackett bid 3@S over 1@S (a massive difference in hand evaluation because he was not in a limited system)|pg||
mb|p|nt|lestergold: undeserved technically but when you ar behind you need a little push and luck|pg||
nt|rnmalik: :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: well, that board would be a breakpoint|pg||
nt|nyg8:  that was my point - 11 tricks for EW....|pg||

nt|nyg8:  if you guess the Clubs|pg||
mb|1D!|nt|h_karluk: walls have ears|pg||
nt|copeyj: and when justin asked about Ks, he heard 6@D which i believe was that K or the other two - so Justin knew at worst on a hook and could be solid|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: 3nt best|pg||
nt|lestergold: could have gone other way and meant an ignom,inous defeat such is bridge|pg||

mb|p|nt|andyv:  3N and 4@s make here|pg||
nt|h_karluk: in my book 7 means adventure|pg||
nt|paulg:  getting a flat board, going down in game when your team mates make part score, is always amusing when you score up|pg||
nt|haans: less that 11-13 raise (2@H)|pg||
nt|jallerton: 2@s = @s+@c?|pg||

mb|p|nt|h_karluk: however this was a lucky day, who knows tomorrow|pg||
nt|haans: yes Gazzilli (in sweden we call it Hexan)|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 3NT seems to have a shot though|pg||
nt|mdgraham: can't see EW doing any more bididng, but you never know|pg||
mb|3D!|nt|mdgraham: interesting decision to bid 4@S....presumably 3@S showed (at least) three |pg||
nt|vasmar: if he finds clubs he can get 10 tricks|pg||
nt|h_karluk: minor major in a single bid, in te rest ing|pg||
nt|jfaria: he can now|pg||
nt|haans: a Gazzilli variation |pg||

nt|yusufb: yada @s atak olmazsa tezcanýn dedigi gibi|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  seems odd that S would insist on @s game |pg||
nt|haans: 3nt would have been slam try|pg||
nt|xenya: quite a helpful lead...|pg||
nt|haans: usually no singel but slammish|pg||
nt|arvidsson: jag tror på hemgång fortfarande|pg||

nt|nyg8:  i would not pass that....|pg||

nt|pikonlu: italyanýn dandirik maclari neden yayýnlanýyor EBL onu aciklasýn bence|pg||
mb|4C|nt|dimi: not the best lead|pg||
nt|mdgraham: South has quite a good case to pull the double|pg||
mb|p|nt|andyv:  can't believe 3@s showed 3... S is never allowed to get out in 3@s?|pg||
nt|haans: (Häxan = Witsch)|pg||
nt|pikonlu: parayý bastýran macý yayýnlatýyor|pg||

mb|p|nt|mdgraham: sorry, I must leave too - I have a bridge match|pg||
nt|arvidsson: om försvaret hittar att angripa hj|pg||

nt|nyg8:  sK and then C swithc|pg||
nt|pikonlu: bizde ulkere gidelim, cafecrown yayýnlatsýn|pg||
nt|pikonlu: :)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: italyanýn HER maçýnýn yayýnlanmasý için HER turnuvada BBO'ya para verdiði bilinen bir gerçek|pg||
mb|p|nt|rodvenn: so Iceland got to Lightner double 6! played from West. 1 down|pg||
nt|pauleger: @c lead would have been best|pg||
nt|mdgraham: thanks Simon, thanks operator - and well done to Denmark|pg||
mb|p|nt|haans: @CJ right|pg||
nt|andersk: and Norway stoped in 5@S on the next slam, as we predicted|pg||
nt|rodvenn: this is a funeral|pg||

pc|c6|pg||
nt|pelu: no: 3@S by N = 3+ @S - System note 14 :):))|pg||
nt|Walddk1: Our matches in round 2 (all from the open series in 1 hour and 35 minutes) are: Italy v Turkey, Norway v Croatia, Sweden v Denmark, Netherlands v Spain, and Portugal v Poland|pg||
nt|andyv:  specs educating me... one states that 3@d may show a weak 5+ in major or other strong hand and 3@h or 3@s is the other major forcing to game.... interesting treatment.|pg||
nt|rodvenn: i think thw way Iclenad bid to 4@s on board 11 was impressive|pg||
nt|rodvenn: the way Iceland bid|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Thierry, the way the game goes on "Movie" its imposible 4 @c was down 1? Was there a wrong claim or something ?|pg||

pc|cK|nt|haans: IMP are not like MP|pg||
nt|eweber: North has already shown 11 HCP, making it easy to know that all Qs are in S|pg||
pc|c5|nt|vasmar: he plays safely to ruff 4th spade if they split 4-2|pg||
pc|s7|pc|c8|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|pauleger: operator, pls check the score of bd 16 - with that line of play it was -3|pg||
pc|cT|pc|s8|nt|eweber: so a club will be safe to reach the hand again later, if necessary|pg||

nt|vasmar: but he is afraid of many minor losers|pg||

nt|haans: Time tomorrow: 10.30 13.30 central time|pg||

pc|dJ|nt|eweber: South plays the 4th club after coming in whith the 1st round of trumps, of course|pg||
pc|d5|pc|s8|nt|vasmar: since there is a ruffing finesse position in diamonds 6 are cold|pg||
pc|d7|pg||

nt|copeyj: but hasnt|pg||

nt|h_karluk: guys that's antiflannery, 1st time saw around 1987 in some Brasil international team, the next year was popular amongst many Europeans but quickly disappeared, now back again|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Difficult lead for North|pg||
nt|mdgraham: North may contest this - 2NT?|pg||
nt|nyg8:  X is dangerous with onl 2H|pg||
pc|s8|nt|xenya: hmm...|pg||
nt|lestergold: Gold has decided to get out of this misfit auction early|pg||
nt|lestergold: shouldbe able to scramble 8 tricks here|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i guess the twins like to toll the dice|pg||
nt|lestergold: a PLUS SCORTE ON THESE CARDS WOULD BE VERY GOOD FOR N/S|pg||
nt|h_karluk: *roll|pg||
nt|paulg:  when I see that they play in 4@h in the other room, i presume someone passed Redwood (keycard in diamonds)|pg||
nt|jallerton: Burn's Law violation in other room|pg||
nt|haans: better contract|pg||
nt|haans: no E did make a take out|pg||
nt|haans: W took out|pg||
nt|jillan:  The bidding was "slighty" different. South opened  1S and North bid 2S.. |pg||
nt|paulg:  Looks like the Hacketts created most of the trouble by opening the South hand|pg||
nt|jallerton: In fact 6@d is where you want to be - not easy|pg||
pc|s6|nt|pauleger: this wont make|pg||

nt|haans: believe 3@C was GF|pg||
nt|mikael_w: Jag antar att 1 @h visar @s, så nu behöver inte Cullin oroa sig för den färgen längre|pg||

nt|mikael_w: men dom har säkert bra ordning på sådant, men man blir ju alltid lite orolig|pg||
nt|affe82: 5@d är väl vad som kan försökas. men det blir väl tungt med trumf fran försvaret ngn gang.|pg||
nt|mikael_w: ja, jag tror man skall vara glad om man går hem i delkontrakt i @d här|pg||
pc|sQ|pg||
nt|mdgraham: double|pg||
nt|mdgraham: by West|pg||
nt|nyg8:  S will bid 4D now|pg||
nt|nyg8:  giving N an option with only 2H|pg||
nt|mdgraham: can South infer that North has diamonds|pg||
pc|h5|nt|h_karluk: no worries, its fine|pg||
nt|mamos: i think South needs to lead Hearts |pg||
nt|mamos: after cashing will do|pg||
nt|mamos: if not North will be endplayed |pg||
nt|mikael_w: ajajaj|pg||
nt|affe82: vi kan enas om att det fanns 3 andra trumffärger som var bättre iaf.|pg||
pc|h3|nt|xenya: perhaps N expected to find S with xx xxx xx xxxxxx|pg||
nt|jallerton: Mari-Volcker(France) and Stockdale/Brown (Eng ladies) made 6@d I hear|pg||
nt|mikael_w: det var just detta jag syftade på, men det ÄR jobbigt när fi bjuder hela tiden|pg||

nt|koksoy: ým  sure   he  would  play  on  diamods  if  he had  played  4|pg||
nt|mdgraham: West content|pg||
pc|hA|nt|rodvenn: prabably with overtricks|pg||
nt|rnmalik: had 9 top tricks and with @D lead 10.|pg||
nt|haans: sweden have increased there lead|pg||
nt|Gerben42: its very close though, for example @CA onside would suffice|pg||
nt|dimi: 3@hs and a @s trick as a minimum|pg||
pc|h2|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 4-0 break of course not helpful|pg||
nt|mikael_w: och det skall det vara|pg||

nt|mamos: still ok if plays Heart when in with Club|pg||

mb|4S|nt|rmb1: Didn't the defence have 2 trumps for the last three tricks?  Declarer claiming 2 tricks was unlikely|pg||
nt|h_karluk: oh ACOL|pg||

mb|d!|nt|pauleger: Auken - von Arnim played only 2@h on this board|pg||

nt|mamos: sorry qx|pg||
nt|pitiful:  probably expected south to have more than 10points for 2N|pg||

mb|p|nt|h_karluk: 22/18|pg||
nt|jallerton: Thanks also to my co-commentators: Hans, Paul and Ben|pg||

nt|mamos: these handa re glaringly obvious for us .......... but declarer has a different view :)|pg||
nt|eweber: they are playing very quickly, maybe too quick this time|pg||
mb|5H|nt|pitiful:  n-s have a @s partcore here|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 1NT would be 14-16|pg||
nt|dimi: 6@s could be a cheap defense|pg||
nt|Gerben42: strange |pg||

mb|p|nt|rnmalik: Board 17 may result in double swing for Sweden.|pg||
