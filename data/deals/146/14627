mb|4S|nt|yuval10: N in the OR also opened 1@h |pg||
mb|p|nt|yannis3012: begining with a difficult 3nt to make|pg||
nt|star6ija: 17-18 direct 1 N, 19-20 via 1h|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: EW system is 4-card majors, light style 14-16 and 15-17NT. NS is Transfer Walsh 15-17NT|pg||
nt|athene: tricky hand to play - ruffing diamond finesse is a possibility|pg||
nt|bagman: There are lot's of high cards out and E passed and W opened weak|pg||
nt|athene: the problem is that ruffing diamond finesse might not be that useful, even if the king is with east|pg||
nt|athene: because if the @DQ is covered you have to use the @CA to get back there for a fast pitch of the heart|pg||
nt|athene: and that gives up on a double club finesse|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer wants a quick discards and wants to play the clubs for one loser|pg||
nt|athene: it's possible he might put all his eggs in one basket and take a normal diamond finesse; i.e. lead to the queen|pg||
nt|bagman: W  has shown up with @HKQ, does he have @DK and @CH?|pg||
nt|athene: the other issue is, you aren't necessarily going all-out to make|pg||
nt|athene: if it risks incurring two or three additional vulnerable undertricks|pg||
nt|bagman: S vulnerable he needs to make as many tricks as possible unless he has 9 safe|pg||
nt|bagman: He has likely 3 spade losers and a club|pg||
nt|athene: not at all an easy decision for south here|pg||
nt|athene: i prefer to open these hands 2@S first time|pg||
nt|athene: passing might appear safer but you often end up having to take more of a risk later at a higher level|pg||
nt|bagman: If he takes the straight diamond finesse, he needs to play @S to the Q|pg||
nt|athene: he knows the points are split fairly evenly between east and west|pg||
nt|bagman: Hoping for Jx KQxxx Kxx Qx or similar leaving E AKx xx xxx Kxx|pg||
nt|athene: west has weak-2 and east can't open - that doesn't leave much room for variation, with 21 hcp missing|pg||
nt|athene: the only problem is, there are a lot of variations in which cards each defender has|pg||
nt|bagman: If he places KQ of hearts and @DK west, he is quite restricted to place the rest for a make|pg||
nt|andreasw:  only lead is @S if u dont want to give any trick's|pg||
nt|haans: South do not liked it|pg||
nt|othered1: hi!|pg||
nt|lesniak: teraz musza zmienic na kiera|pg||
mb|p|nt|lmeili: 4N shows 6 4?|pg||
nt|ziff:  Looks like the par contract|pg||
nt|yuval10: so no swing in a rather dangerous board |pg||
nt|yuval10: Israeli open for instance opened 1@c and played it wrong-sidedly, going down 1|pg||
nt|aldek: it can be made, but unlikely|pg||
nt|cameron_1: yes|pg||
pc|dJ|nt|roswolf: another thinnish game reached|pg||
nt|haans: landed fair|pg||
nt|poohbear: trump lead and its over|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: yes not easy|pg||
nt|haans: Hi Barry wlc|pg||
nt|poohbear: sorry|pg||
nt|poohbear: dont mean to chat|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: hi barry|pg||
nt|udo: 4 @H fails , even finding @H Queen doubleton is not enough|pg||
nt|udo: no entries for the 2 top-spades for diamond discards|pg||
nt|brolucius: East expects six hearts for a 2@H rebid that bypasses so many alternative rebid. Hence the raise.|pg||
nt|udo: hm, only 2 clublooses|pg||
nt|udo: losers|pg||
nt|othered1: with @CJ on, this does make (6@H, 2@S, 1@D, 1@C)|pg||
nt|udo: small @H to jack will be enough|pg||
nt|othered1: or win in dummy, pitch @C, hook rounded suits|pg||
nt|othered1: sorry, pitch @D|pg||
nt|udo: or 2 discards after heart to the jack|pg||
nt|othered1: (Ignore me, I'll awaken shortly)|pg||
nt|udo: jack of clubs is the important card, and it is well placed|pg||
nt|udo: same here:)|pg||
nt|udo: good morning ED:)|pg||
nt|tomi2:  I think they should not have bid that game, IMO east should have passed 2@H|pg||
nt|brolucius: At last I have managed to find a Lauria-Versace convention card. The 2NT response on Board 1 was a limit bid in partner's major. More often nowadays, 2NT shows a game-forcing ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: raise.|pg||
nt|8252: les 2 derniers matche sdes français comptent donc double, puisque Bulgare et allemands seront au tour suivant|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|andreasw:  u can also selved @d self but would problebly go wrong|pg||

nt|brolucius: Declarer seeks an entry with the @HJ.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We have something for the history books after this mornings round. Italy has lost back-to-back matches! No-one can remember when that last happened. Los 10-20 to Hungary last night ...|pg||
nt|Walddk2: and 14-16 against Hungary today|pg||
nt|tomi2:  was his intention to duck the 10 or overtake?|pg||
nt|othered1: EW system is described as Swiss-ACOL.   I'm not sure how limited the 2@H bid was.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Duck, I expect, to set up the @HJ (or avoid losing a trump trick). Unlikely that they would duck @HQ - but possible at this level.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: We got the names right now, thank you operator|pg||
pc|h2|nt|yannis3012: hi ntino|pg||
nt|ziff:  I imagine 4NT showed a desire to play that contract|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup|pg||
nt|bagman: If he places the @DK east, he has probably some better chances to make|pg||
nt|brolucius: Now declarer can ditch his diamonds.|pg||

nt|boyklas: hi all, elinescu-wladow play precision right?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Yes interesting. No slam makes from S, but 6@D makes from N|pg||
nt|haans: been there|pg||
nt|mamos: ??|pg||
nt|haans: as so often BODY of big value|pg||
nt|lesh: I wonder why he played the ace|pg||

nt|jkotor: widzê 2 lewy do zwrotu na 5@d tutaj|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|ziff:  Strong club|pg||
nt|motu: 6@C from N is cold, because of  6-1 @H |pg||
nt|lmeili: yes 6@c by N always cold, W has no @h to cash when wins @c K|pg||
nt|mcarroll: They certainly play fast!!|pg||
nt|andreasw:  3nt here|pg||
nt|shevek: both pairs play 2/1 GF ; cc at: http://tinyurl.com/29ud57z|pg||
mb|1C|nt|star6ija: something like 5@h|pg||
mb|d|nt|ady: a heart pip shourt of a good slam here   can make by dropping A@H doubleton|pg||
nt|bagman: 5@C on the heart finesse|pg||
nt|star6ija: do they change the systems?|pg||
nt|haans: all you need for slam is no clubs lead :)|pg||
nt|cameron_1: i dotn think j@c was played|pg||
nt|udo: off shape 1 NT|pg||
mb|p|mb|1S|nt|eweber: unluckily we still don't have running scores from group B in the Open|pg||
nt|motu: DBL is 6-8|pg||
nt|boyklas: 1@h is a transfer to @ss|pg||
nt|lmeili: easy 3N for EW|pg||
nt|boyklas: nvul, would you have bid 3@s now?|pg||
nt|motu: not my style|pg||
nt|ady: if in a slam 6@C is the best spot    6@H down quickly on a club lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: true but slam is a little far fetched if you ask me|pg||
nt|davidb: N practically looks at 8HCP|pg||
nt|bagman: 3NT on the same|pg||
nt|star6ija: and to guess heart position of course|pg||
nt|aldek: operator, what has happened?|pg||
nt|Walddk12: Welcome to Murat Molva|pg||
nt|MolvaM: hello everyone|pg||
nt|andreasw:  again 3nt is better then 4@s|pg||
nt|shevek: 3@s = 6 cards, Max|pg||
nt|andreasw:  Hello Murat|pg||
nt|shevek: hi Murat|pg||
nt|lechcold: 1BA interesuj¹ce:)|pg||
nt|bogier: 9-11??|pg||
nt|snetram:  dzikie otwarcie 1NT w zaÅoÅ¼eniach korzystnych. Styl gry w tych zaÅoÅ¼eniach staje sie coraz bardziej destrukcyjny|pg||
mb|3C|nt|mcarroll: So no problem then :)|pg||
nt|udo: everybodys choice?|pg||
nt|brolucius: The play on the last deal is one that you often see in book (sacrificing a trump trick to gain an entry to two winners). Less often at the table.|pg||
mb|p|nt|lmeili: not me|pg||
nt|roswolf: hearts will be the chosen trump suit i'm sure|pg||
nt|MolvaM: hi :)|pg||
nt|andreasw:   Haraldsson got scared?|pg||
nt|shevek: well stopped|pg||
nt|MolvaM: if 3@s shows max, then north must go 4@s no?|pg||

mb|p|nt|h_karluk: pre vs pre + un vs un are useful toys|pg||
nt|ady: should not be if in a slam|pg||
nt|roswolf: maybe not -|pg||
nt|bagman: Now S must do something|pg||
nt|athene: it might be hard for NS to diagnose they hold a diamond stopper betwen them|pg||
nt|brolucius: In that example he probably had a trump loser anyway.|pg||
mb|3S|nt|eweber: and the result of round 2 is not yet online|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 1@D has multiple meanings, could be negative|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 1NT is a strong NT |pg||
nt|eweber: 18-20|pg||
nt|Gerben42: maybe 17 because white / red they play a mini NT|pg||
nt|roswolf: we will see now|pg||
nt|santyclz: 4@s e-w looks interesting.|pg||
nt|bagman: Looks like NS end in a club partial|pg||
nt|athene: many pairs would be able to bid with south's hand first time|pg||
nt|shevek: sry, I see now it shows 6@s and minimum|pg||
nt|aap00: 1@c = precision?|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: not a good position of the key cards seems will go a few down |pg||
nt|haans: needed the 7th hearts for 3@H bid|pg||
nt|antoniz: brawo Adam|pg||
nt|marlowepi: photographe de la main d'E se trouve dans l'encyclopaedie sous la rubrique "contre d'appel sur une ouverture de 1T"|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Mais sur 1 @C fort aussi - cela depends|pg||
mb|4C|nt|star6ija: Bulgarians are in 3N in the open room|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Vladimir and Ivan vs Thor Erik and Thomas|pg||
mb|p|nt|bagman: good for them as the heart finesse is off|pg||
nt|athene: for example playing transfers you could bid 1@S there to show values but deny a major|pg||
nt|athene: assuming your 1@C is not raise-able, as is the case for most people these days :(|pg||
nt|bagman: I wonder what 1NT would have shown by S |pg||
nt|star6ija: board 1|pg||
nt|mcarroll: A swing so as 3NT makes on 1|pg||
nt|shevek: with Max he'd bid 3 in a new suit|pg||
nt|MolvaM: makes sense then|pg||
nt|Walddk12: We'll have the name corrected soon. I asked our coordinator to go to the room|pg||
nt|Walddk12: Some operators don't look at their screen|pg||
nt|andreasw:  let's say Magnusson had show,n max would u bid 4@s or 3nt?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 4@s for me|pg||

nt|MolvaM: running scores at....|pg||
nt|andreasw:  u dont really have ace's and king's and the minor suit's is not wery good in 4@s i think i would bid 3nt and let p decide|pg||
nt|MolvaM: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/runningscores/asp/roundteamsconditstatclassicmod.asp?qtournid=819&qshowflag=1|pg||
mb|p|nt|lmeili: if N bids 3@s after X, declerar might guess wrong of @d|pg||
nt|boyklas: double by west was take-out or establishes GF?|pg||
nt|motu: t/o|pg||
nt|lmeili: except guessing @d all other ways work|pg||
nt|haans: or costly ...|pg||
mb|p|nt|lmeili: @d AK then @h|pg||
nt|bagman: The diamond length often makes up for the missing stopper|pg||
nt|athene: south really likes his hand after his partner's free 2@C rebid|pg||
nt|bagman: Interesting 3@H|pg||
nt|bagman: cannot be natural|pg||
nt|athene: he is looking for 3nt - prepared to play 4@C if necessary|pg||
nt|haans: cue-bidding makes slam harder to make :)|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: the bid is on the limit ·3@H |pg||
nt|haans: but all will get higher|pg||
nt|andersk: this will be an easy make |pg||
nt|lesh: Probably he is going to play @d to the ace and a spade|pg||
pc|s9|nt|roswolf: north does bid the slam how is south's luck today?|pg||
nt|ady: may get this right     west will show with singleton club|pg||
nt|davidb: W  overcall will make the guess in H tuff|pg||
nt|roswolf: yup agree david|pg||
nt|roswolf: i expect this to go down|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: seems  a 4@H -1 |pg||

nt|shevek: Wales is running 6th|pg||
nt|MolvaM: seems many norths could just blast 4@s after hearing pd open a weak 2 here|pg||
pc|c5|nt|haans: 5@H risky|pg||

nt|aap00: 1@c = strong, 1@s = looks like "bal GF", some relays|pg||
nt|ftpe: yes|pg||
nt|haans: few entries to dummy|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: getting worse after K@H|pg||
nt|haans: well only non vul|pg||
nt|brolucius: Only 1 IMP to Germany for the fancy play in 4@H. Semanta advanced with 2NT on the East cards, after the same start, and 3NT was bid and made.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: guys, was that a hidden camera joke? I meant 2nd trick a low spade towards dummy|pg||
nt|andersk: Or @C|pg||
nt|lesh: if the king of spades is 3rd in East, he needs A@h to be in West|pg||
nt|lesh: the small spade makes no sense|pg||
nt|h_karluk: I think today is Monday June 28, 2010, so obviously not April one, whatever|pg||
pc|cK|nt|aap00: playing @dQ, not 10 correct - you can discard 3d @d by @c|pg||

nt|aap00: so 4 is reasonable contract|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer has some sort of chance to ditch a diamond on one of the black suits. A diamond finesse and a heart break would then give him a chance.|pg||
nt|brolucius: South's signal on the top-club lead deterred Lauria from cashing his other high club, thereby giving declarer a diamond discard. Buit the @DK is wrong anyway.|pg||

nt|h_karluk: we will see |pg||
pc|c9|nt|andersk: 990 now|pg||
pc|cJ|pg||
nt|chick: bypassing drury may have some kind of subtle implication about strength|pg||
pc|d2|nt|Gerben42: changed from last time and will change again next time I guess|pg||
nt|andreasw:  3nt 11 trick's finessing @d|pg||
nt|othered1: i.e, it's a game virtually everyone will get to|pg||
pc|d8|nt|athene: lauria's negative double over 2@D warned south off getting involved with his spade suit|pg||
pc|dT|nt|aap00: for me strange, with 10hcp and passed pd |pg||
nt|haans: not easy clubs finesse|pg||
pc|d4|pg||
nt|lmeili: if S ducks @dA|pg||
nt|bagman: I would guess that declarer discards a club on the hearts and gives 2 spades and 2 hearts|pg||
nt|athene: Sementa is prepared to lose his @HK to hold declarer to one heart winner rather than two|pg||
nt|bagman: Sementa's duck gives defense 3 spades instead of 2 spades|pg||
nt|brolucius: A high spot-card (@C7) is discouraging, against both suit and NT contracts. (Reverse attitude).|pg||
pc|c5|nt|mcarroll: I agree - lets the defence signal very comfortably|pg||
nt|h_karluk: the only possibility to make this a thrown-in play with misdefense of West|pg||
nt|aap00: so, "well deserved" -5 impls|pg||
pc|cT|nt|haans: @H6 even|pg||
pc|cK|nt|peachy: NS 1H opening might not be everybody's choice, but they play 4-card majors, light style|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|peachy: oops, he overcalled!|pg||
nt|ziff:  I must confess that I would not sell the E hand as 9+, but Entscho s judgement has always been somewhat different....|pg||
nt|h_karluk: pitch the spade and lose the board|pg||
pc|d5|nt|MolvaM: this is a 630 or 660 hand for the field to rest their grey cells|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Thor Erik was in San Remo 2009, i guess evil made him do that double|pg||
pc|h2|nt|andersk: will probably go down|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|athene: he will carry on with the time-honoured antidote to a 4-4 trump fit - keep leading trumps|pg||
nt|bagman: Declarer can play N to have AQx and make now 10 tricks|pg||
pc|d6|pg||
nt|peachy: ignore everything I said, please :)|pg||
nt|bagman: Or W can let N to have @SQ|pg||
nt|athene: declarer probably thinks the club is offside|pg||
nt|athene: he will try and endplay north|pg||
nt|athene: duck another spade now, perhaps|pg||
nt|bagman: The @C-finesse working is an extra bonus|pg||
nt|andersk: maybe, I cant see what damage ¤@H direct might couse|pg||
pc|s6|nt|xenya: i'm told there are no commentators in the open room, so I think i'll switch over there|pg||
nt|ftpe: now he plays safe|pg||

pc|s3|nt|haans: they do not show count|pg||
nt|andersk: Time to give @c count for East now|pg||

nt|h_karluk: +1|pg||

nt|h_karluk: S4SX+1|pg||
pc|c7|pc|sT|pc|c6|pg||
nt|peachy: best to get a diam out now|pg||
nt|h_karluk: not abt @c count|pg||

pc|h6|nt|shevek: in bd 2 (the mirror hand) Iceland gained 12 imps|pg||

pc|hQ|nt|athene: ok well done|pg||

pc|c8|nt|mcarroll: Obviously listening to you Anders :)|pg||
nt|andersk: abot time:)|pg||
nt|andersk: about|pg||
nt|h_karluk: then declarer wld be a @h less and a @c more|pg||
nt|h_karluk: as @c K favorably placed always makes, west doesn't need to care signals|pg||
nt|h_karluk: just count it out more and make fine judgement|pg||
nt|andreasw:  claim|pg||
nt|udo: would be down now, even with !J diamond in the finesse?|pg||

pc|cA|pc|hJ|pc|hA|pg||

nt|h_karluk: very careless play by the declarer and very nice defence by West|pg||

pc|s7|pg||
nt|rnmalik: but for the @S finesse had a good chance to make it.|pg||
nt|roswolf: never likely to be bid though|pg||
nt|brolucius: You see how light South's 2@S response is. Everyone does that nowadays, to allow partner to compete if he has extra trump-length. In the Bad Old Days, a raise to 2@S was considered ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: a 'free bid' (particularly in the USA) and promised a king's ransom.|pg||

nt|yuval10: 4+|pg||
nt|tomi2:  Hackett raised to 3@S with only 3 cad support. I play a cuebid by overcaller as 3 card support raise with maximum here, so 3@S would always be 4 cards for me|pg||
nt|yuval10: seem like a nice agreement|pg||
nt|yuval10: you have to play over the @h's in 4@s|pg||

nt|lmeili: 3@c says 9+ red cards not min hand|pg||

nt|motu: i guess i would lead a@H|pg||
nt|tomi2:  seems like a good idea too, in case S has also a singleton you cut this communication|pg||

nt|athene: maybe 2@S is specifically michaels|pg||
nt|bagman: Is it T/O or 2-suiter?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hi.|pg||
nt|athene: many pairs play "leaping michaels" over these bids, so 4@D would be reds|pg||
nt|bagman: hi|pg||
nt|fokal: so I guess 2@s shows a two suiters for sure|pg||

nt|andreasw:  1@s and 4@h after 3nt|pg||
nt|udo: 7@D|pg||
nt|udo: or NT|pg||
nt|udo: lets see|pg||
nt|brolucius: It is natural to bid 4@H rather than 5@C because it is a trick less. When the opponents go to 4@S and you want to bid at the five-level, you have a free choice between hearts and ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: clubs.|pg||
nt|8252: tu as donc 2 pseudos|pg||
mb|p|nt|yuval10: i agree with those 2 arguments you made|pg||
nt|shevek: neither side can make game|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 3nt seems not makable|pg||
nt|tomi2:  lauria only needs to find partner with two aces here, should be possible to find|pg||
mb|2H|nt|ziff:  In a marked contrast to our table Scotland and Italy have won 40 and 46 IMP in 5 boards.....|pg||
nt|lmeili: they should reach to 4@h, 1@c-1@d , 1N 2@c|pg||
nt|tomi2:  sometimes pd will jump to 2 level with 4 cards only and you have a hard bidding later|pg||
nt|tomi2:  os della Monatas hand now worth a raise to 6?|pg||
nt|yuval10: i believe W must add now....P is willing to play in the 5 level ALONE when he's VUL, and you have AK A?|pg||
nt|tomi2:  AKtx of trumps and the ace in their suit?|pg||
nt|yuval10: *she's|pg||
nt|yuval10: very likely that we'll see a sacrifice from NS|pg||
nt|tomi2:  if S bids 5@D now w has a difficult bid|pg||
nt|yuval10: Pass forcing?|pg||
nt|tomi2:  E-W are clearly in a forcing pass situation, but do you pass with TWO small dias?|pg||
nt|roswolf: unless n/s get carried away|pg||
nt|davidb: yes  no  great  boards yet...|pg||
nt|ady: can make 6NT    6@S  beaten on heart lead|pg||
nt|roswolf: the axe might descend here|pg||
nt|davidb: ??  aces...|pg||
nt|bagman: Ok, now let's see how the void is shown|pg||
nt|cameron_1: might chooce 4@s since Drijver's X was prob snapfragon style i.e. 2@s 5@c|pg||
nt|aldek: double showing clubs and a doubleton spade|pg||
mb|p|nt|athene: it's never easy to bid a grand slam which depends on a void (i.e. where you are off an ace)|pg||
nt|mcarroll: still a possible 5 imps missed|pg||
mb|3C|nt|eweber: but NS can escape by cashing their tricks|pg||
nt|lmeili: 2@h 3@h|pg||
nt|haans: close to spade raise|pg||
nt|yuval10: you have to do something with this AKTX trump and A@h|pg||
nt|cameron_1: choose a game i guess, a little strange because most use that to claim "ownership" and show a good hand|pg||
nt|mamos: what strength was 2@h   do we know - forcing ?|pg||
nt|mamos: will england bid on ?|pg||
nt|andreasw:  3nt should not win yes|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: he ruffed H with the Q, unnecessary|pg||
nt|xenya: looks like another boring hand|pg||
nt|lechcold: dziêki wejciu Brinka nasi dojd¹ do 3BA|pg||
mb|3N|nt|peachy: empting to Dbl with S hand|pg||
nt|peachy: tempting|pg||
nt|andersk: If 5@C makes, then 3 NT makes too|pg||
nt|bagman: If N can ask aces, S can bid quite a lot|pg||
nt|athene: did south think 4nt was asking for the minor?|pg||
nt|fokal: sementa has no idea of the @s void , he might try to protect his K of @s|pg||
nt|fokal: by bidding NT|pg||
nt|bagman: Now 5@S, I guess|pg||
nt|fokal: obvisously S interpreted 4NT as 'what is your minor , partner ? '|pg||
nt|athene: they might scramble into the grand if south finds 5@S now|pg||
nt|hawe45:  What was 2 @S exactly?|pg||
nt|bagman: It's bad to have your misunderstanding on a grand slam deal|pg||
nt|athene: but if there really has been a misunderstanding it's asking a lot to recover and go on to bid a tricky seven|pg||
nt|athene: 2@D showed spades, weak or strong (or some monster balanced)|pg||
nt|athene: so 2@S was obviously a cue - whatever they play that as|pg||
nt|hawe45:  So 5 @S now might do...|pg||
nt|cameron_1: i imagine tom was happy not to have to guess over an immediate 4@s from Brink|pg||
nt|MolvaM: thomas bids what he hopes he can make|pg||
nt|MolvaM: reasonable bid but doesnt work today|pg||
nt|MolvaM: but maybe pushes opps to 4@h|pg||
nt|xenya: 2N promises 20+|pg||
nt|Walddk2: His suit might not be solid :)|pg||
nt|lechcold: i wygraj¹|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 6T aurait eu une chance de gagner si E avait cache ses coeurs, mais evidemment 2C est 100% normale|pg||
nt|marlowepi: a cartes ouvertes c'est faisable meme sans entame coeur, mais le dec fera les deux impasses perdantes|pg||
mb|p|nt|rigas_karo: 4@s in 5-1 fit in the oper room, probably +1|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: looks like an easy 3NT|pg||
nt|boyklas: its difficult to find the Jxx after this bidding, except if he lead it|pg||
nt|ady: should south double if they get to 6@S    might remove to 6NT|pg||
nt|psridhar: difficult to bid 5d on their own last bd- needed push from oppo|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: a part score 2@S by West|pg||
nt|h_karluk: so W missed to find 4/4 hearts fit|pg||
mb|p|nt|wygbe1: yep it is|pg||
nt|Walddk12: Good morning to Paul Hackett|pg||
nt|wygbe1: and it was |pg||
nt|ady: problem is not there|pg||
nt|roswolf: e/w were merciful but have missed the boat somewhat|pg||
nt|cameron_1: it is usally right to bid on know double fit hands|pg||
nt|tomi2:  but he should not bid 4nt too fast, because it could be keycard for spades, and partner would sell @SAK and no @CA as two aces|pg||
nt|andersk: 4@S is makeable, but <i do not understand why Charlie didnt look for @H suit first|pg||
nt|andersk: need to do something good in @s to make|pg||
mb|p|nt|tomi2:  not hackett should bid 5@H rather than double I think|pg||
nt|ady: sorry    blind spot    2 aces missing|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: can go -1 with a good defence timming|pg||
pc|d3|nt|rigas_karo: well this is an easy way :)|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Morning everyone|pg||
nt|peachy: Good morning Paul|pg||
nt|wygbe1: morning|pg||
nt|yuval10: very interesting sequence to work with your partner|pg||
nt|bagman: When a misunderstaning occurs, it's difficult to recover, because neither player knows what the misunderstanding has been|pg||
nt|athene: even if both players suspect, neither one can be sure his partner is in on the secret|pg||
nt|bagman: If N thinks that S has 1 ace and @S-void, he still cannot bid the grand|pg||
nt|athene: these sort of auctions are where top pairs really have to put in the time away from the table|pg||
nt|athene: because there are lots of imps riding on these hands|pg||
nt|lechcold: ogranicznie nie znoszê takich wejæ:)...|pg||
nt|aldek: zgadzam sie|pg||
nt|aldek: ale w holandii nie moge nikogo przekonac ze to sensu nie ma|pg||

pc|d4|nt|boyklas: thats true|pg||
nt|athene: even if they don't come up all that often|pg||
nt|Walddk2: OK|pg||
nt|snetram:  za wzgledu na depresjÄ. PoniÅ¼ej poziomu morza tak bywa|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|Gerben42: this contract will be no problem, will duck once to guard against 5-2 @C|pg||
nt|ziff:  2@Sx would have been 3 down at least on a @D lead or switch, but not easy to find, and 620 are available|pg||
nt|star6ija: 11 tricks|pg||
nt|antoniz: Adam zagra przez trefle z powodów komunikacyjnych|pg||
pc|dJ|pg||
nt|paulhac:  It is a playable game just but not with the trump break they did well to only go 1 off in the othere room|pg||
nt|lmeili: after 1@c 1@d what is 1N shows? some player holds 7 HCP as E they may not inv to game|pg||
nt|andersk: this will be -2 or more|pg||
nt|MolvaM: what about 5@c?|pg||
nt|udo: @D agreed now ?|pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: Czy wygra, to zobaczymy... W jasne karty ³atwo|pg||
pc|d2|nt|brolucius: 5@H, cue-bid denying a club control. Now 6@C will show first-round club control.|pg||
pc|h5|nt|wygbe1: playing for 50 hearts, could set up spades and run them through south for down 1, losintg ak of spades and 2 hearts|pg||
nt|h_karluk: -3|pg||
nt|h_karluk: just play off top hearts|pg||
nt|andersk: I know - 3 double dummy, but they dont see all cards:)|pg||
nt|rodvenn: In practice 3@h is a good bid|pg||
nt|h_karluk: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_total_tricks|pg||
pc|d6|nt|Gerben42: sry always 2nd stopper|pg||
nt|eweber: just heard the second match of the Dutch was 11-19 vs Spain|pg||
nt|aldek: 4@S was close as well|pg||
nt|tomi2:  with 5@H he committses himself to 6 level even if partners @C were QJT, or does 4@S also show @C control?|pg||
nt|udo: hard now|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|motu: depends on vul|pg||
nt|h_karluk: true|pg||
nt|yuval10: now only 2 down....can't be good for the leaders|pg||
nt|xenya: 12 tricks |pg||
nt|ftpe: yes|pg||
nt|ftpe: south should play club|pg||
nt|brolucius: Versace may think: 'I must have club ace to suggest a grand slam (with another spade cue-bid), so this is more accurate, showing @SK too.|pg||
nt|lesh: have to guess right|pg||
pc|c2|nt|ziff:  undo?|pg||

nt|andersk: Do you good people understand the 5@C raise?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: if we are talking abt std signals|pg||
nt|andersk: I would probably try 3 NT|pg||
nt|h_karluk: by N?|pg||
nt|mcarroll: yes lots of game plus - but slam minus  hands|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|eweber: results of round 2 are online by now |pg||
nt|eweber: http://www.eurobridge.org/competitions/10Ostend/asp/roundteams.asp?qtournid=820&qroundno=2|pg||
nt|eweber: England leading the group with 50(!)|pg||
nt|eweber: Russia 13th with 27|pg||
nt|eweber: NL 17th of 19 with 17|pg||
nt|othered1: But first south recues @S, guaranteeing some kind of @C control, I'd think|pg||
nt|udo: 5@S is ?|pg||
nt|brolucius: He would just bid 6@D with second-round club control.|pg||
nt|tomi2:  5@S = both black aces|pg||
nt|udo: i am told @S king and first round club|pg||
nt|brolucius: Well, he has already shown @SA, hasn't he? (With 4@S).|pg||
nt|tomi2:  probably with no @SK he'd bid 6@C|pg||
nt|brolucius: Indeed.|pg||
nt|udo: and 6@D with second round @C controll?|pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: Teraz to zmusili Go do zrobienia nadróbki...|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|mamos: England have done well on this board I feel|pg||
nt|othered1: And Lauria selects the highest scoring (and unbreakable, if partner has 1@D) spot.|pg||
pc|d7|nt|haans: Bulgaria do not play Blue Clubs but Precision|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: dangerous but works here |pg||
nt|psridhar: true 3h makes -but two eight card fits deterred the pairs from venturing into 3 level -THE LAW :)|pg||
nt|tomi2:  problem is again, waht does he bid with no club control? 5nt is nonforcing?|pg||
mc|11|nt|boyklas: 4C at te open room? not 4S?|pg||
nt|lmeili: tx, that means they'll reach 4@h any how|pg||
nt|andersk: Need AQxxxxx and almost nothing more for it to be makeable|pg||
nt|roswolf: israel avoided the slam on bd 3 in the other room and so gained 11|pg||

nt|bagman: He needs to guess 3 things: a) 5@D shows the 2nd suit, b) S has 2 aces, c) S has @S-void|pg||
nt|athene: well there's no way anyone is guessing all that|pg||
nt|athene: what they need is some way for north to agree hearts|pg||
nt|athene: then it's relatively easy|pg||
nt|athene: but slam auctions are hard when no-one knows what trumps are|pg||
nt|bagman: I'm sure they'll go back to the drawing board after this match|pg||
nt|santyclz: Perhaps 3@s over 2?  |pg||

mb|1D|nt|lesh: a peaceful 4@h here, but lets see|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i guess slam @h|pg||
mb|p|nt|wygbe1: several roads to down one, as long as declarer assumes s has all the trumps|pg||
nt|yuval10: NS in the OR found the 6@d sac.|pg||
nt|roswolf: bd2 was flat when 4@S was also allowed to make|pg||
nt|fokal: on 6@h it seems clear to me that north couldn't make a move|pg||

nt|cameron_1: flat borad|pg||
nt|mamos: multi|pg||

nt|h_karluk: in practice very hard to reach, given layout diamonds favorably placed|pg||

nt|yuval10: so "only" 5 imps to Austria|pg||
nt|mamos: i think youd want to be in game|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 5c has much chances if declare can manage the 4-0 split|pg||
nt|tomi2:  7@D could be in danger of some ruff, not likely, but why take the risc...|pg||
mb|p|nt|peachy: 4H rolls now,, on lucky spade sit|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Although the K@S is right the K@D is wrong so 4@H is an excellent contract|pg||
nt|peachy: EW have a paying sacrifice, rare at Vul|pg||
nt|andersk: Might be possible to bid game here|pg||
nt|bagman: If North was confident that 4NT was RKCB in hearts, that was a good bid; no need to re-cue with 3@S|pg||
nt|fokal: but maybe S could (should ?) have bid something else than 6@h|pg||
nt|haans: the law is not the law just suggestions :)|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: another part score hand |pg||
nt|udo: guess after 3 NT Lauria gave him club A or King|pg||
nt|brolucius: If North has a club more and a diamond fewer, he would be delighted to hear of the @SK, which would give a second club discard.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: not guilty Maam :) i was living in an ocean away and the internet was not invented. i was just thirsty and eager to buy any foreign bridge book, thanks |pg||
mb|1N|nt|motu: 1N is 9+  with 4cMajor possible as you can see|pg||

nt|paulhac:  Without a heart ruff|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 4 cards M 4th seat|pg||

nt|athene: well, it was only good if he was confident and he knew his partner was confident it was, too :)|pg||

pc|h2|nt|motu: everything is possible here:)|pg||
nt|athene: just the five obvious tricks to lose here|pg||
pc|h9|nt|eweber: no miracle in the 4@h contract, but an imp for Russia anyway|pg||
nt|tomi2:  so 1 kexcard is missing and they stop in (a bad) game - I am no fan of this auction...|pg||
nt|chick: or a simple 2@H overcall|pg||
pc|hA|nt|lmeili: at least it makes even guess wrong @s|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|h_karluk: just needs to play a trump|pg||
nt|h_karluk: say East played Ace and switched back to @c|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ruff with K|pg||
nt|athene: red ace-kings and a diamond ruff|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: no entrys in West to develope the @D |pg||
nt|h_karluk: well aren't we ready to play at least 3 level in any suit ? |pg||
nt|chick: EW potentially had 3N, so a disaster for NS is not a given|pg||
nt|lesh: a possible 800, South has to be careful|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: tam król kier sie utrzyma³|pg||

pc|cJ|nt|collins64: about the previous deal, you always have to discuss before is it or not GF 4@c overcall after weak 2@h opening|pg||
nt|MolvaM: now he can do his throw in|pg||
nt|jkotor: to mówi: "nie wiem czy ich X, czy graæ wy¿ej"|pg||

pc|cK|nt|h_karluk: @h A  favorably placed|pg||
nt|MolvaM: which he didnt need actually :)|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|pg||
nt|athene: no chance for the defence to get a trump promotion going and i don't see why declarer should take a backwards trump finesse|pg||
nt|xenya: S showed 5-4 in the minors, but clubs could longer than diamonds, so N had to guess -- hence his pass over 2@C|pg||
pc|cQ|nt|collins64: West had a very nice hand with 19HCP and East Pass with 2 Kings and a 7-card Q10 suit|pg||
nt|rnmalik: oops|pg||
nt|haans: we all see the clubs finesse|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c7|nt|andersk: wrong slam|pg||
nt|andersk: normal line|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 10 @C could come in play |pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|collins64: x Kxx Q10xxxxx KJ|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: if 4@c is not GF easts is reasonable however, he thinks the hand is a misfit, and his K@h can be a wasted value|pg||
nt|andersk: a lucky make|pg||
nt|andersk: since @H K is together with 3 card @S|pg||
nt|rnmalik: no on a @H finesse can make 7. @D lead would force him to take a finesse.|pg||
nt|andersk: I must be sleeping, 6 is alw cold|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: Sorry for the rush for the previous deql now we are align with the players|pg||
nt|rnmalik: ok and thanks.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: but still may go down|pg||
nt|davidb: board  6  was classical  SPL   -suit preference lead -  high H for D |pg||
nt|ady: ooops     Patchman trying to protect possible entry and clear the hearts|pg||
nt|andreasw:  ok 9 trick's |pg||
pc|c5|nt|motu: i do not see why E went beyond 3N since 2N shoed allready extras|pg||
nt|ziff:  Not easy to bid, as W may have 5 @D and @SA instead of KJ, making slam pretty good|pg||
nt|bagman: No trump promotion but the old fashioned tap|pg||
nt|bagman: Now a heart and ruff with 9 ?|pg||
nt|haans: best not is spades|pg||
nt|aldek: who should bid 4, east or west?|pg||
nt|rodvenn: not vulnerable you should, according to the law, always compete to the 3-level holding 8 against 8. They make, you go one down in the typical example|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Ivan needs subway tickets to enter the table and that doesn't help much|pg||
pc|cT|nt|ziff:  Hope springs eternal, as they say, but I agree that it was agressive|pg||
nt|athene: he is more likely to ruff with the queen surely|pg||
nt|MolvaM: but its good for discussions after the match with yr teammates: "I could have made it even if both @d honors were off"|pg||
nt|haans: Body in clubs very good|pg||
nt|rodvenn: of course you may feel that your hand has intermideate cards in their suit which makes you take another course|pg||
pc|dT|nt|eweber: I don't count correcly, 4:1 is correct|pg||
nt|h_karluk: now trump promo possible|pg||
nt|bagman: what would you do then?|pg||
nt|cameron_1: i think they play the method 3m=non max lin linked M and 3M=max in other M|pg||
nt|mamos: I dont think West can    |pg||
nt|haans: endplay in hearts|pg||
pc|c9|pg||
nt|rnmalik: No @H finesse 6.|pg||
nt|andersk: East will get a trumph raise|pg||
nt|ftpe: will be poor result for ns i think|pg||
pc|s5|nt|andersk: unfortunate for the sweeds|pg||
nt|h_karluk: the declarer should play a trump to K before touching @h|pg||
nt|cameron_1: so it was up to tom|pg||
nt|udo: hm,,,,was this the best line?|pg||
pc|sA|nt|rnmalik: tricky hand after very good lead of @D. we have seen all cards so easy for us.:)|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 3@S in E is key to its making without finesse also which is % wise low.|pg||
nt|andersk: Austrians|pg||
nt|h_karluk: ruff and do that - now or never|pg||
nt|haans: and a make???|pg||
nt|h_karluk: not really|pg||
nt|h_karluk: if pitches and plays a trump to table goes down to @c shift|pg||
nt|h_karluk: if ruffs and plays a trump to hand always makes, thinner than a hair line|pg||
nt|haans: best play was not to cover|pg||
nt|Walddk12: Good morning to Peter Crouch|pg||
nt|xenya: quite poor, yes|pg||
nt|xenya: 2@D is certainly better, although i'm not sure it makes |pg||
nt|lesh: 500 now, against 4@h it is a good result|pg||
nt|marlowepi: un spec astucieux note que 6P est faisable sur la donne precedente|pg||
mc|9|nt|motu: with a decent hand and 5-5 W will make move over 3nt|pg||

nt|collins64: if it is NF|pg||
nt|paulhac:  England takes the lead for the first time.|pg||
nt|andersk: unlucky board for the Austrians|pg||

nt|MolvaM: 3@c shows what?|pg||
nt|shevek: no, not from here !|pg||
nt|MolvaM: both minors?|pg||
nt|shevek: 3@c = 5-5 in the minors|pg||
nt|andreasw:  it should|pg||
nt|hawe45:  E/O ou N/S?|pg||
mb|p|nt|collins64: another 2@c opening in North|pg||
nt|athene: will south double 2@H or bid 2@S?|pg||
mb|1H|nt|andersk: Italy running good in Bridge, but currently out of the world cup|pg||
nt|star6ija: 3N is possible here|pg||
nt|aldek: I'd say west should bid on the base of the quality of the spades, an ace and a singleton|pg||
nt|cameron_1: i agree|pg||
nt|andreasw:  i will go a few times and be back after 10 second's have to see score's from danaish match:)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  danish*|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 3nt would be nice if thomas knew about the @hK with partner|pg||

mb|1S|nt|collins64: both majors at least 44|pg||
nt|boyklas: i think he judged that the hand shouldnt be to game with the singleton S and the KH wasted value after showing C+S|pg||
nt|bagman: If partner has Txx left, both the 9 and the Q work; what about other holdings?|pg||
nt|ftpe: boring cards again|pg||
mb|d|nt|star6ija: stubborn @s stopper|pg||
nt|haans: 14-16 nt|pg||

nt|udo: me too,,,therefore i asked only:)|pg||
nt|othered1: for 10 tricks, I don't see better|pg||
nt|brolucius: The players in the Open Room are not exactly burning the baize with their playing speed, They are three boards behind already.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 7 boards and 24 IMPs exchanged, interesting|pg||
nt|aldek: przeczytaj moje pytanie, prosze|pg||
mb|p|nt|jameslee 2: East a take out 2@D on a dangerous 1Nt X|pg||
nt|lesh: probably E will bid 2@s or 2@h|pg||
mb|1N|nt|paulhac:  IF East had been the overcaller one could say that Spain were unlucky|pg||
nt|h_karluk: well, sorry i disagree that was unlucky|pg||
nt|roswolf: south will no doubt transfer and offer his pard a choice of games|pg||

nt|shevek: looks like it|pg||
nt|andreasw:  no best slam with @d AK out:)|pg||
nt|shevek: but 5@d is not a make|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 5d seems ok since defence cannot take their club ruff with a small trump|pg||
nt|rodvenn: Very good bridge to reach 5 @d in both rooms. |pg||
mb|2C|nt|xenya: or the score is wrong -- that happens from time to time|pg||
nt|lesh: but over 2@h West might blast to a game|pg||

nt|jameslee 2: second X pass out |pg||
nt|psridhar: this can be set 800|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: quite  a few down -3/-4 could be the result|pg||
mb|3D|nt|wygbe1: probably lebensohl|pg||
nt|santyclz: The 6@h+1 ended as a push.  Neither n/s was able to overcome the preempt.|pg||
nt|star6ija: happens... :)|pg||
nt|shevek: yes|pg||
nt|haans: easier to play 2@D doubles not game sore if make|pg||
nt|psridhar: if defense can find the club ruff-they will get plenty of opportunities for the ruff|pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: Tam wyszli po raz drugi w Kiera. Alew chyba nie dadza rady wypuciæ|pg||
nt|8252: on devrait abdiquer, les @s ont souvent raison|pg||
mb|p|nt|lesh: well looks like over 2@s as well :)|pg||

nt|jkmjanusz: Gdyby @CAs by³ u W, by³by przymus...|pg||
mb|p|nt|ftpe: he will try ruff 2 di at hand|pg||
nt|lesh: the defence has to be careful|pg||
mb|p|nt|eweber: in board 4 NL managed to win 4 by making 2@d, so 5:4 for them now|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Lebensohl or transfer Lebensohl. Transfer Lebensohl would show both monors|pg||
nt|peachy: even down 1, this be small gain for England|pg||
nt|peachy: and it could slip home|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Which is Jason and which is Justin?|pg||

nt|shevek: can't score a ruff on top of AK|pg||
nt|lesh: he didnt has the entry ,however the small spade gave it|pg||
nt|h_karluk: then ruff hearts and try devil's coup|pg||
pc|s2|nt|athene: the auction in the other room looks like an interesting twist on leaping michaels - you bid 4 of the minor you haven't got|pg||
nt|athene: that is perhaps sensible if you play the bids as forcing|pg||

nt|athene: which means duboin can't have had a count on the diamonds - if he knew declarer had four he would have bashed out that @S10 like a shot|pg||
nt|athene: the standard counter to a 2-suiter being to force declarer|pg||
nt|andreasw:  then a @d to ace and a @s back |pg||
nt|haans: yes dirty upscore|pg||
nt|psridhar: might hv worked on some other layout |pg||
nt|jameslee 2: yes 800 always dangerous|pg||
nt|lesh: here we go :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 5@c/@d ok|pg||
mb|p|nt|roswolf: israel made 3nt on bd 4 for another game swing|pg||
nt|ady: partial here in spades   Ireland need to keep low|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes may well get too high|pg||
nt|psridhar: Fredin will briefly consider 3nt b4 bidding 4s when he finds out his pd has unbal hand|pg||
nt|Walddk2: There was no follow-up to discuss. North jumped to 3@D, South thought it was a WJS and passed|pg||
mb|1D|nt|Gerben42: apparently the rooms are connected now|pg||
nt|Gerben42: white vs red NS are very agressive, but as we have seen vuln. they are middle of the road|pg||
nt|eweber: 3@s is not exactly what you'd dream of with the South hand...|pg||
nt|Gerben42: best to not dream but pass with a happy face|pg||
nt|eweber: I assume West is the one who is taking his time here|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Great to see the Irish at the top of the leader board|pg||
nt|josj: as far as I know, they were about 30 mins. late and were eventually fined 3 VP each|pg||
nt|tomi2:  getting informed that they got 3 VP back each|pg||
nt|tomi2:  thx|pg||
nt|athene: ok :)|pg||
nt|aldek: England on the board|pg||
nt|andreasw:  @d to king and alot of @s trick's|pg||
nt|shevek: south can only get in once (@dK)|pg||
nt|ftpe: that opening will probably bring them to 6 spades|pg||
nt|xenya: on 7, the Estonian EW in the other room got to 4@H -- not a bad contract really, but down on foul trump split -- 1 down and 7 imps to Russia|pg||
nt|ftpe: in 6 spades he has to guess spade queen, but best chance is playing on sp 2-2|pg||
nt|haans: 10-13|pg||
nt|lechcold: 54 impy w 8 rozdaniach|pg||
mb|4S|nt|mcarroll: Unfortunate lie of the cards, but will be the same in the other room  one assumes|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hmmm?|pg||
nt|athene: my guess is they put the board on the table upside down|pg||
nt|santyclz: Hand reversed?|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: ty vugragher |pg||
mb|d|nt|boyklas: FG raise with D?|pg||
nt|boyklas: or 14+ Bal?|pg||
nt|haans: that 1@S overcall???|pg||
nt|xenya: i don't think 6@S is such a great contract -- problems in spades and diamonds|pg||
nt|ftpe: agree, but they will get there after ligth open, |pg||
nt|xenya: well the 3@H bid makes it easier to solve the spade problem|pg||
nt|haans: Fredit pass??????|pg||
nt|udo: Ed,Tomi,Roland,,thks so far,,,have to leave for work:)  would like to stay here..|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Thanks Udo|pg||
mb|p|nt|ftpe: after 3 he better chance to play north for Qxx in sp|pg||
nt|haans: ERROR|pg||
nt|brolucius: Work? What is that?|pg||
nt|tomi2:  then they should discuss their first round of bidding as well :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|collins64: 2NT is GF with @d|pg||
nt|collins64: GF with 4+ @d|pg||
nt|boyklas: 6D makes here|pg||
nt|collins64: 3NT 12-14 balance|pg||
nt|boyklas: with the AH in his place|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: difficult decision for South here|pg||
nt|andersk: 3 NT?|pg||
nt|peachy: operator doing great job, keeping up with the fairly fast pace at the table|pg||
nt|pitiful:  4@h not timid|pg||
nt|xenya: yes|pg||
nt|udo: i will send u an E-Mail, david|pg||
nt|brolucius: Thx.|pg||
nt|lesh: what might appeared to be a sacrifice for N/S it will be a makable game :)|pg||
nt|chick: 3@D is enough|pg||
nt|lesh: they need to find @c support|pg||
nt|lesh: 1@d has to be alerted I think|pg||
nt|lesh: they play prec :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|rigas_karo: it is safe to bid once again but |pg||
nt|rnmalik: very tempting:)|pg||
nt|mamos: good pressure from South|pg||
nt|othered1: Bye, Udo.|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i choose 3@h cue here|pg||
nt|chick: right, 3@C is a better bid|pg||
nt|lechcold: basketball|pg||
pc|hK|nt|collins64: if Mike bid 4@d, Isabelle 4@h they'll play 6@d|pg||
nt|eweber: if anyone of the players|pg||
nt|yuval10: not everyone's X perhaps|pg||
nt|ady: this might cause Irland to get too high|pg||
nt|jkotor: jak w dobrych juniorskich czasach :)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|rigas_karo: 4@d or 4NT?|pg||
nt|roswolf: the boards have been swingy - Italy - slovakia 46-0 after 4 boards shows how|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Vul, not for the fainthearted!|pg||
nt|mamos: at least a couple off|pg||
nt|cameron_1: but flat vs. 3@s so|pg||
nt|cameron_1: flatish|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes but N takes the firsst @D trick|pg||
nt|MolvaM: good stop|pg||
nt|andreasw:  first|pg||
nt|xenya: no slam now -- just collecting your money i think...|pg||
nt|lechcold: 2BA naci¹gane|pg||
pc|h6|nt|andersk: opps|pg||
nt|andersk: cold 4 @H|pg||
nt|mcarroll: 4@H +1|pg||
nt|athene: not sure i like unusual 2nt with 6@D4@C|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: :)|pg||
nt|athene: partner usually bids clubs with equal length which isn't at all what you want|pg||
nt|athene: notice how south can't bid stayman intending 2@S (sign-off) over 2@D|pg||
nt|athene: they obviously play that as something cunning|pg||
nt|athene: we have seen they have lots of relay auctions after stayman so you do lose the ability to bid it on rubbish hands|pg||
nt|shevek: 8 declarer made 3N and 8 went down|pg||
nt|shevek: declarers|pg||
nt|MolvaM: so it must have been a 50% contract :)|pg||
nt|shevek: true, needs accurate defence|pg||
nt|shevek: lol  murat|pg||
nt|xenya: or... who knows?|pg||
nt|lesh: he has to guess Q@d now, but it is difficult and probably -2|pg||
nt|hawe45:  300 avec le bon flanc - mais tout normale|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|pitiful:  some play middle encourages and high or low sp in this situation|pg||
nt|shevek: to be fair some went down in 6@d :)|pg||
pc|d2|nt|collins64: he made the wrong choice|pg||
nt|boyklas: all the problems comes here for S because he doesnt know the H or the C Quebid|pg||
nt|boyklas: and he make go down even a 5D|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: at least the did well to avoid 6NT :)|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: 5@d by North is safe|pg||
nt|collins64: Belgium is back after the previous deal|pg||
nt|collins64: Dehaye weak NT forced them to play 4@h for one down|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: very weak NT :)|pg||
nt|boyklas: Manolis choosed to play at the 5-3 fit and not at the 4-4, firstly was thinking that he is playing at th 5-4 fit|pg||
nt|collins64: the bidding was 1NT 8-11 Pass 3@c X and he bid 4@h with his 5-card Q@h and his 4-card 8@s|pg||
nt|ady: they might make this  getting 3 diamond tricks|pg||
nt|lesh: A@s and @d switch|pg||
nt|h_karluk: straightforward play also possible|pg||
nt|chick: against the odds to drop the @DQ, but W may lead trump now to protect against a spade ruff|pg||
pc|d9|nt|dburn: perhaps he should have signalled for a heart|pg||
nt|aldek: and now @DQ|pg||
pc|dK|nt|collins64: did he actually play the K@h|pg||
nt|boyklas: i dont think so.|pg||
nt|andersk: probably @H 9 lead|pg||
nt|rnmalik: suit worth bidding is worth leading.:)|pg||
nt|haans: most would say "thats not fair"|pg||
nt|davidb: should make on the  D suit |pg||
nt|athene: if north has a pretty good penalty pass here unless he thinks the double is really really offensive|pg||
nt|santyclz: The "DNPA" (does not promise anything) stayman has a lot going for it, but gives up a lot on big hands.|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Entame atout - et bonne chance...|pg||
nt|haans: @H to ace to avoid @S ruff|pg||
nt|jkotor: nasi tu 1ba graj¹|pg||
nt|lechcold: 3BA te¿ naci¹gane:) i rezultat bêdzie chyba adekwatny|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|rigas_karo: strange|pg||
nt|andersk: should make now|pg||
nt|paulhac:  And the other room is 2 boards ahead|pg||
nt|andersk: the famous "almost 1k"  +990|pg||
nt|roswolf: i am told gib says the game can make -in practice i am confident it wont|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Sorry - trump lead - and good luck, I meant|pg||
nt|star6ija: 8+points, 5+@hs|pg||
nt|chick: OR, E could make a brilliant overtake of the spades and lead a trump :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: if ther declarer decided to play straightforward that doesn't make a sense|pg||
nt|chick: unfortunately, that gives away the location of the @DQ, so S might just try for the drop now|pg||
nt|h_karluk: *the|pg||
pc|hJ|nt|peachy: so even faster there|pg||
nt|ady: problem is the tap with the clubs|pg||
nt|star6ija: :)|pg||
nt|haans: claiming time|pg||
nt|lesh: well East is forced to switch to @d, having or no @d|pg||
pc|s2|nt|mcarroll: Although playing safe after the double 4 is the probable outcome|pg||
nt|psridhar: actually 3nt is superior cont-4s may fail if h ace was wrong|pg||
nt|othered1: Lauria and Versace seem not to have adopted the modern support double.|pg||
nt|snetram:  zauwazcie Å¼e jeszcze dwa rozdanie wcale nie musiaÅy byÄ remisowe. Wtedy by byÅo 80 IMP|pg||

nt|8252: moins 1 ou moins 2 suivant les nerfs de Fred à @c|pg||
pc|h7|nt|rnmalik: Possibility only if declarer guesses the entry to W hand.|pg||
nt|athene: Mari shamefacedly trying to shift some diamonds in with his clubs, courtesy of a black pen|pg||
nt|brolucius: Speculative double from East.|pg||
nt|othered1: Their doubles show extras, I believe.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: They prefer to use double for something else. One can survive without support doubles you know|pg||
nt|tomi2:  eas has @CAQ in their opened suit, @DA, @SQ and partner made a constructive call vulnerable|pg||
nt|brolucius: Kibitzers suggest lead-directing double (similar to Lightner). But not obvious to me, nor to West.|pg||
nt|lesh: Q@D :)|pg||
pc|h3|pg||
nt|hawe45:  This trick is VERY important, North|pg||
nt|othered1: I survive very well without them in almost all partnerships that don't have hours to discuss their ramifications.|pg||
nt|jkotor: 80 to ju¿ blisko mojego juniorskiego rekordu 88-1 w 8 rozd|pg||

pc|sA|nt|xenya: down 4 if W just cashes his high cards now|pg||
nt|ftpe: wow, 3 he in open room :)|pg||
nt|xenya: he will have to do it sooner or later |pg||
nt|ftpe: + 50 not much when close to 1430|pg||
nt|xenya: well E didn't open there, and that made all the difference |pg||
nt|psridhar: not after the X of course|pg||
nt|haans: yep 3nt a make|pg||
pc|s6|nt|hawe45:  Ouf|pg||
nt|ryskiel_: i do tego jeszcze czerwoni le¿¹ dobrze|pg||

pc|s4|pg||
nt|ady: I think can be made playing a diamond to the 9 after Q@S|pg||
nt|roswolf: yes intra finesse position|pg||
nt|pitiful:  still a nice pick up for n-s|pg||
nt|pitiful:  even without the double|pg||
nt|marlowepi: trois fois trefles, as de pique, carreau et pique, un trefle aussi eventuellement au flanc|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c4|nt|athene: still 800|pg||
nt|ftpe: rigth|pg||
nt|xenya: of course, you could argue that EW might have got in later in the auction, but it's easier to say...|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|hawe45:  But less than 500 will be difficult|pg||
pc|c6|pg||
nt|xenya: by the way, i think the E hand is an opener|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Le retour du 9 de @H Ã¡ la place du Valet aura ete mieux|pg||
pc|h9|nt|mcarroll: Back to +1 after no trump shift|pg||

pc|s3|nt|Walddk2: Be careful Ed, David may have to look that word up too|pg||
nt|brolucius: Declarer has three minor-suit stoppers to knock out.|pg||
nt|jkotor: czy nie lepiej teraz z pozycji Adama 10?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|rnmalik: In the OR K@D was led.|pg||
nt|chick: yes but not forced to overtake the @S, that he would do only if a @D lead was needed from E|pg||

nt|ady: diamond to the ace and diamond to 9|pg||
pc|c7|nt|roswolf: might play @DQ|pg||
pc|c3|nt|xenya: only 10 hcp, but they are good and it's a 5-4-3-1 shape|pg||
nt|drkvas: semi|pg||
nt|brolucius: He is leaving the @S9 to help him deal with the forces.|pg||
pc|c9|nt|athene: if versace doesn't balance - i think that's a sign that pass is right|pg||
pc|cQ|pg||
nt|athene: versace not known for his shrinking timidity in the auction|pg||

nt|pitiful:  yes a good effort by north|pg||
nt|pitiful:  some might pass the north hand surprisingly|pg||
nt|marlowepi: un bon contrat|pg||
pc|h8|nt|rnmalik: The contract I mean.|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: that's what I got from thr CR|pg||
nt|athene: if east suspects the 1@H is a psyche he can't be so sure about the diamond finesse|pg||
nt|shevek: I would pass every time|pg||
nt|brolucius: One heart loser goes on the @CA, so slam depends on picking up the trump. But no reason to think they will bid it.|pg||

nt|andersk: 10 min left|pg||
nt|haans: i think he did not have a clue were @SJ was :)|pg||
nt|athene: but more likely it's just a shaded opener|pg||
nt|othered1: EW's card mentions "distributional asking relays," which may be in effect here.|pg||
nt|8252: oui, mais c'est les même levées à SA|pg||
pc|h3|nt|boyklas: he may play well the S, if he play small to the A and see the KS drops he can play small to T now the JXX cant be played|pg||

pc|c2|nt|pitiful:  still if he did he would probably be on lead to 4@s anyway|pg||

mb|2S|nt|rnmalik: 3NT for Ns.|pg||
nt|tomi2:  in the OR Piekared prefered a double here to 2NT|pg||
nt|tomi2:  ending up as dummy in 2@D, not the contract he was dreaming of|pg||
nt|athene: i am not sure where they went wrong but clearly a wheel came off somewhere|pg||
nt|pitiful:  another lead directing bid|pg||

nt|shevek: I just had a glimpse at the poles playing in 6@d|pg||
nt|shevek: you too :)|pg||
nt|andreasw:  :)|pg||
nt|lesh: I wonder what 1NT is|pg||
nt|chick: 3 suit takeout?|pg||
nt|lesh: I suppose N/S will land at least at 5th level, but then E/W might bid 6@c and then ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: say didn't begin w art 1@c, 3 aces outside, so that's DD slam of EW players, what a homework, ty teacher!|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: EW possibly in trouble now|pg||
nt|xenya: perhaps W was concerned about bad splits in the balck suits and 4-1 @Hs, but all was well|pg||

mb|4S|nt|andersk: Est overcalled 1 @S in open room, and South 2 @S, quite strange bidding, anyway NOrway playing 5 NT in open room|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Looks like 4@H should make|pg||
nt|tomi2:  Wladow knows about partnes @C qualitiy, so he won't lead a club now ;)|pg||
nt|mamos: Gold keeps his 1@D openers up to strength :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|ady: 5@C looks difficult with a trump trick and A@S off  and diamonds bottled up|pg||
mb|p|nt|andersk: 2-2|pg||
nt|andersk: no|pg||
nt|andersk: offside|pg||
nt|andersk: incredible match on TV too:)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 6@d may have communication problems.... between parters :)|pg||
nt|lesh: probably 1nt was 3 suits and that's why North decided to pass over 3@d|pg||
nt|lesh: and possible 5@c bid by West now if 1nt is what we suppose to mean|pg||
mb|p|nt|lesh: but still it will be very agressive |pg||
pc|h3|nt|eweber: but still, with 210 and 170 on my score card I wouldn't feel to good, it may not cost but surely won't bring in...|pg||
nt|andersk: even more exsiteing then bbo|pg||
nt|ady: 3NT hopless if they lead hearts   |pg||

nt|jameslee 2: dangerous reopenning here |pg||
nt|psridhar: thin 4s for EW , a lucky make -but imposs to get there unless pushed|pg||
nt|haans: but most of us would|pg||
nt|psridhar: South does have a good hand, cant fault him for reopening|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: what will North try to bid ?|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i think a similar example was in one of Ian Fleming's 007 JB books|pg||
nt|h_karluk: trappy sample|pg||
nt|lesh: I dont think North will pass|pg||
nt|lesh: South has showed 0-5 and 6+ spades but ...|pg||
nt|chick: N's hand is far too good|pg||
nt|chick: almost slam in hand|pg||
nt|lesh: 4@h is making|pg||
nt|chick: only problem is ... can he overcome his fear of 4-1 or 4-2 trump split in a red suit|pg||
pc|h5|nt|paulhac:  Putting South to the test|pg||
nt|star6ija: 2@d game forcing|pg||

nt|chick: "pick another suit"|pg||
nt|lesh: he can even make 5@d|pg||
nt|lesh: 4@h and 5@d making but 3nt not |pg||
nt|chick: he can make 6H if he plays E for something like 4414 or 4405 ... losing 1 heart and no diamonds ... or am I missing something?|pg||

nt|lesh: opps 3nt also makes:) He has the entry for @d finess|pg||
nt|lesh: he can but it is impossible to bid|pg||
nt|h_karluk: i whispered he could pass to 3NX but seems was busy a lot and did not hear me|pg||
nt|chick: entry for @D finesse is a problem|pg||
nt|chick: and 6@C EW is makeable too, I think|pg||
nt|lesh: slams are makeable but it is diffucult to reach. |pg||
nt|chick: I dunno, I'd still keep trying to reach a red slam with N's hand|pg||
nt|lesh: from the bidding you know what 4@h are 4-1 at least and there is 4th @d in West|pg||
nt|chick: yes, that's what is scaring N into serious caution|pg||
nt|lesh: your partner is 0-5 points with 6+ spades|pg||

nt|jkmjanusz: Przepraszam...|pg||
pc|hK|nt|collins64: no Mike show count on J@d lead 7 cards so not possible |pg||
nt|MolvaM: to protect the @cQ and against bad breaks,|pg||
pc|h9|nt|ady: got of to a bad lead    but still defence can recover  South will need to play a low heart when in with A@S   and north will have to read the position|pg||
nt|star6ija: decided by the defense|pg||
nt|andreasw:  Magnusson in control here and chose 6@h|pg||
nt|tomi2:  if he exited with a heart, Versace could have won the Jack and give partner a @D ruff to "get back" the 2 imps Kirmse was working for, but we don't know the cards exactly|pg||
pc|h4|nt|roswolf: the lead was i think another sols flight of fancy|pg||
nt|shevek: good choice|pg||
nt|andreasw:  yes had Mag bid a cue Harald would bid 6@d and Mag had to make a choise|pg||
nt|andreasw:  after 4nt from harald ofcourse|pg||
nt|MolvaM: spade lead?|pg||
nt|andreasw:  small @h lead but could cost the beating trick|pg||
nt|MolvaM: and then another spade (when in with @hA) could create problems|pg||
nt|andreasw:  i would lead the @c|pg||
nt|MolvaM: declarer must refrain from cashing diamonds|pg||
nt|lesh: opps|pg||

nt|marlowepi: de certaines mauvaises repartitions des atuts, qui nettement n'existeraient pas a 6SA|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: 5 imps for NL I predict|pg||
nt|haans: ty|pg||
mb|1S|nt|ady: last hand with the diamonds well hand South might have ducked the first spade  and if spades continued  north night have played the 10 on the 2nd round as a suit preference signal|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 2s shows?|pg||
nt|MolvaM: a normal weak 2?|pg||
nt|andreasw:  in my book it would be to strong for a weak bid|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, the boards in this set haven't been overly exciting so far|pg||
nt|ftpe: 2 diamond multi i guess, hard with only 5-carder and minimum|pg||
nt|jkmjanusz: Jansma próbuje: 4BA|pg||
mb|p|nt|santyclz: On the other hand, that was an awfully quacky hand, even with 15 "Pearson Points" (hcp + number of @ss.)|pg||
nt|MolvaM: a knowledgeable spec tells me: maybe invitational (or almost) with spades|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: other room playing in hand nº 12 just 2@S  (no reopening call ther by South ) |pg||
nt|psridhar: 800 just may not be a disaster if only the Israelis stumble into 4s making|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: so swing coming for sweden|pg||

nt|marlowepi: merci Joey, et sois le bienvenu|pg||
mb|4H|nt|paulhac:  Possible swing here as 4@S should make but not guaranteed|pg||
nt|roswolf: good point david|pg||
nt|MolvaM: or barely invitational  :)|pg||
nt|shevek: looks like some weakish non-fit bid|pg||
nt|xenya: 3rd seat... -- still a bit too aggressive to my taste|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: 5@D -1 |pg||
nt|psridhar: gr8 contract -the Herbsts hit back !|pg||
nt|haans: 5@D was a bit to much|pg||

nt|haans: 2 aces and a spade|pg||

nt|haans: different versions of walsh transfer in sweden we bid only 1nt with S hand|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: still a lot to say by both teams |pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@S shows a @H raise and @S shortness |pg||

mb|p|nt|pitiful:  6@C is a playable spot here|pg||

nt|star6ija: I think they managed to play in same directions aiming to be shown on the Vugraph :)|pg||
nt|haans: 1@S to show 2 3 spade no extra|pg||
nt|brolucius: 2@C was forcing to game, so I suppose a 2@S continuation covers all the spade raises.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 3@H over 2@H would be a @H raise and @D shortness|pg||
nt|othered1: and with no side shortness?|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Let me ask giammi|pg||
nt|8252: sans les @s, on a du mal aussi|pg||
pc|h3|nt|Gerben42: now at least 2|pg||
pc|hA|nt|eweber: while this one would only promise a swing if the open NS pair weren't playing strong NT, but they are|pg||
nt|ady: now 6 easy tricks    I am sure a 7th will come|pg||
nt|shevek: I'm told 2@s is 8-10 , 6@s|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: nice K@C helping card showing to secuence & giving parner a relax moment to tell him your lead made no damagge to defence|pg||
nt|marlowepi: meme cela revient a la chance:)|pg||
pc|h2|nt|pitiful:  safe play by declarer|pg||
nt|mamos: making safe|pg||
nt|pitiful:  leaving trump in dummy to ruff @s|pg||
nt|Walddk2: 2NT= asking for min/max and distribution. Denies @S raise, may have @H|pg||
nt|Walddk2: So they go through 2NT with a balanced heart raise|pg||
pc|h9|pg||
nt|boyklas: 5C at boar 12|pg||
nt|rnmalik: would require some play.|pg||
nt|andersk: this contract is not makeable|pg||

pc|dQ|nt|haans: do not understand low spade|pg||
pc|d3|nt|boyklas: boar|pg||
nt|shevek: I think it also suggests shortage in @h|pg||
nt|chick: can make 6, but I predict only 5 ... will set up @Ds, they will knock out the other @S stopper, and he won't dare take the @H finesse|pg||
pc|d5|nt|collins64: Mike 14 HCP opening is not going to run good here|pg||
nt|eweber: wow, another 11 for NL|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Spade lead looked normal|pg||
nt|athene: lauria-versace got some way towards 4@H - just not all the way|pg||
nt|pitiful:  you mentioned flash boys|pg||
nt|lesh: with doubleton Q@d and Q@c and @H finess working he can even make 12 tricks|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
nt|peachy: 3Nt was better since hearts 4-4, but one never knows|pg||
nt|chick: hmm, now he may have to take the @H finesse|pg||
nt|lesh: however,what is more important is to make your contract|pg||
nt|jkotor: lol, dosta³em na priv pytanie, |pg||
pc|h7|nt|rnmalik: cannot rule out an error by the defense.|pg||
nt|eweber: 26:4 now|pg||
nt|MolvaM: the iceland pairs doing extremely well in the event|pg||
pc|hK|nt|MolvaM: one pair ranked 1st in butler with 1,66 imp/board|pg||
nt|MolvaM: other 2 pairs also high with 0,84 and 0,3 plus|pg||
nt|MolvaM: 1,66 imp average over 100 boards is phenomenal|pg||
nt|xenya: well at least it served as a lead director|pg||
pc|h8|nt|Gerben42: thanks to the 3@S opener|pg||
pc|c3|pg||
nt|boyklas: Dehaye didnt find the S lead so again some imps for greece|pg||
nt|ady: looks like 8 tricks|pg||
pc|sA|nt|h_karluk: yesterday i was in Florence SC, USA sectional, a young lady offered me for an interview to their local TV channel. Her question was "what's the best thing in this game". I think ...|pg||
nt|h_karluk: 'try to improve your judgement skills' was a fair answer.|pg||
pc|s5|nt|Gerben42: 3NT is a claimer|pg||
nt|roswolf: israel made 4@S ON 9 BUT had some opp bidding to help them|pg||
nt|shevek: iceland lost their 1st match to italy (14-16)|pg||
nt|shevek: after that won 10 in a row|pg||
nt|andreasw:  must have been a good match|pg||
pc|s3|nt|Gerben42: looks they finally start scoring|pg||
nt|eweber: right, over 2@s life is so much easier!|pg||
nt|peachy: yes indeed it did, having stuff in all other suits|pg||
nt|othered1: ty|pg||

nt|andersk: 2,5 minutes left|pg||

nt|shevek: this one looks like yet another one :)|pg||
nt|othered1: Declarer is looking for best way to 10 tricks, not for an overtrick|pg||
pc|sJ|nt|Gerben42: if they win 22-8 they have 39, which is not great but getting back in|pg||
nt|ady: tried for 9|pg||
nt|MolvaM: for me a good match is when I win it|pg||
nt|brolucius: If this sort of deal appears in a problem book (where you are meant to see if you can deal with bad breaks in hearts and/or clubs), I usually turn the page to see the answer ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: straight away. I suppose - somewhere in the  universe - there is a hard-working bridge player who spends ages trying to work out the answers to such problems.|pg||

nt|eweber: in such auctions|pg||
nt|Gerben42: 6@D must be defended carefully, but I think after @S2 lead Drijver will get it|pg||
nt|eweber: with 7 hcp in @s 5@s is an option|pg||
nt|vasmar: double now|pg||
nt|ady: played a diamond to the 9 early on to make 4@S on board 9|pg||
nt|athene: 3@D game try in hearts perhaps but NS should wander into 4@S without too much difficulty |pg||
nt|athene: 3@S pass 4@S now|pg||
nt|pitiful:  5@c a nice spot here|pg||
mb|p|nt|shevek: Unfortunately losing 2@h - 1@d - 1@c|pg||

mb|p|nt|vugraphzng: the CR send me -2 will check|pg||
nt|andersk: ok|pg||
nt|brolucius: E/W play the weak 1NT, as we saw a deal or two ago, so they open 1@D here.|pg||
nt|jkotor: 1nt i think|pg||
nt|hawe45:  - ou 500 Ã¡ 5 @D X|pg||
mb|p|nt|Gerben42: at least the auction heated up some :)|pg||
nt|eweber: no double?|pg||
nt|tomi2:  1@S might have longer clubs than spades, I hope he alerted this :)|pg||
nt|andersk: stoppage time now|pg||
nt|haans: Cullin have it|pg||
nt|ady: very thin balance|pg||
nt|athene: now we have to find the club lead|pg||
nt|pitiful:  Roland is probably glued to the cricket at this moment|pg||
nt|MolvaM: elimination possibilities|pg||
nt|haans: 5@D looked like beginner bridge|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: all nicely placed & good distribution , makes 6@H |pg||

nt|santyclz: Protecting the @hAQ.  Didn't see that coming.|pg||
nt|athene: 3nt not a bad shot - even when a minor-suit lead is right for the defence it's going to be hard for east to find it|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: West trying to disturb bidding |pg||
nt|h_karluk: x and cue|pg||

nt|andersk: OMG ITALY MISSED FROM 5 meters 5 min over stopppage time|pg||
nt|haans: 6@D a make if @H lead|pg||
nt|yuval10: small @s would've been great|pg||
nt|yuval10: then they force declarer|pg||
nt|haans: more likely that E have the Q rather than A = weaker hand|pg||
pc|dT|nt|vugraphzng: NO DOUBLE APPARENTLY|pg||
nt|vugraphzng: sorry for upcqse|pg||
nt|Gerben42: Rudakov didnt know what 5@D showed in defense and Khven didn't count on @DA I guess|pg||
nt|paulhac:  An OK slam|pg||
nt|lmeili: how to show longer @d than @s?|pg||
nt|mamos: was 2@h single or two suited ?  the latter I think|pg||
nt|shevek: phantom got in the way|pg||
nt|MolvaM: tahts the problems with phantoms|pg||
nt|shevek: won't cost much though|pg||
nt|MolvaM: they should stick to hanging out in the operas|pg||

nt|shevek: instead of +50|pg||
pc|s2|nt|vugraphzng: seems to be clqi;end for -2, correction will come later if needed|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Diamonds 3-3 or doubleton J|pg||
nt|andersk: I have to go for a few|pg||
nt|tomi2:  he upgraded his hand to 18 with those aces and kings|pg||
nt|snetram:  teraz operator|pg||
pc|s7|nt|vasmar: now small diamond works also|pg||
nt|vasmar: if S misguesses|pg||
nt|ady: low diamond lead will beat this|pg||
pc|sA|nt|eweber: non vul doubling for -1 is a bad bargain when the contract may be made, none of them knows about the opther one's quick tricks|pg||
nt|ady: thlow spade lead also good enough|pg||
nt|mamos: just Hearts I'm told|pg||
nt|andreasw:  they were not in 4@s|pg||
nt|shevek: phantoms , yes :)|pg||
nt|h_karluk: Ivan was good enough to find it, grats|pg||

nt|peachy: nicely judged|pg||
nt|peachy: as it is, 12 tricks|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Unless he takes a diamond finesse|pg||
nt|peachy: if they duck club, it will be testy|pg||
nt|brolucius: If yo use 12-14 and 15-17 as your ranges for 1NT and the 1NT rebid, a jump rebid of 2NT shows 18-19. They must do something different since West has only 17 here.|pg||
nt|brolucius: Hardly worth an upgrade, with those intermediates, it would seem.|pg||
nt|tomi2:  @S2 gives you the count of the spades, they should behave 4-4|pg||
nt|othered1: Giving an extra Work point or two when  you have only aces and kings is reasaonable, perhaps mandatory|pg||
pc|sK|nt|ady: heart contract for 9 tricks best  |pg||

pc|s3|nt|andersk: ty|pg||
nt|Gerben42: @H ruff is -2 |pg||
nt|yuval10: she indeed misguessed|pg||
nt|athene: small club after the @DA gives declarer a nasty moment but the odds must be to rise king|pg||
nt|athene: west would indeed lead low from @CQJxx, knowing the suit has to run, but it's more likely he simply has the ace|pg||
nt|aldek: non-vulnerable could be very weak|pg||
nt|mamos: not a great bid then imho   it made any exploration of the hands here impossible|pg||
nt|shevek: Thomas would've bid 4@s if it came around|pg||

nt|andreasw:  yes and should be reach easy|pg||
nt|xenya: bordering on a slam though, as the cards lie|pg||
nt|brolucius: A reliable guide, in such circumstances, is to play the method that most top players use. It is their job, so they would not choose to play a second-rate method. If, say, 80% of ...|pg||

nt|eweber: the warm up phase is definitely over, these boards contain explosives!|pg||

pc|c6|nt|vasmar: there may be a club spade squeeze|pg||
nt|psridhar: 40-15|pg||
pc|c4|nt|paulg:  bidding 4@c would have given someone the option of running if doubled (although never easy to work out when to run) ... 4@d has no such safety valve|pg||
nt|paulhac:  Could easily play East for KQ@C doubleton and go for 800|pg||

nt|jameslee 2: 1@H = 4 card @S|pg||
nt|Walddk2: In the finals the 9 teams from one group will play against the 9 from the other group and an aggregate score is calculated|pg||
nt|tomi2:  Italy and Iceland have quite confortable leads, they can try to relax in matches agains teams, that will be relegated for sure and save some energy and avoid time penalties (don't know if penalties are also carried into 2nd RR)|pg||
nt|brolucius: Six teams will qualify for the Bermuda Bowl - the top six in the second round-robin. At the moment the field is split into two, so around the top 3 in each section may be seen as ...|pg||
nt|brolucius: the top contenders at present. But there is some luck involved in which of your scores are dropped after the first round-robin.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Penalties are carried forward if both teams qualify, not if only one of them|pg||

nt|haans: He asked and got NO|pg||
nt|pitiful:  this is a nice spot for e-w|pg||
nt|ftpe: 3 nt was hard bid|pg||
nt|xenya: normal to bid 3N on 25 points, but the game is very thin|pg||
nt|ftpe: punish will come, even if lucky lead|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Fleisher-Kamil, Weinstein-Levin, Stansby-Martel|pg||
nt|tomi2:  I am not a fan of redoubles with hands that have only one thing to say... "I have support and some values". Redouble for me should mean "I want to double the opps" but it is so unlikely for W that he will get opps...|pg||
nt|brolucius: If you play negative bids over a double, you need to use redouble more - I guess.|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Funnily enough this is all about @HQ, is it now?|pg||
nt|othered1: I prefer redouble denies fit, unless game force.|pg||
nt|tomi2:  more often opps will preempt you in spades and partner will not know about your fit when its his turn to bid. You should have a bid in your system to show a constructive or invitational raise directly|pg||
nt|tomi2:  best again is to use transfers :)|pg||
nt|brolucius: transfers are useful in many sequences but no-one ever seems to write a magazine article about them. (Must prefer to keep the advantages to themselves...)|pg||
nt|Walddk2: Gromöller is a hot favourite to go down. He must lose two spades and one diamond, and why would he play South for @HQ after the take-out double?|pg||
pc|h5|nt|ritong: rumen va d abord essayer de faire tomber le @d V|pg||
pc|hA|pg||
nt|rnmalik: and thought well:)|pg||
nt|tomi2:  my gues is: his intention was "pd pls bid 3nt with a spade stopper"|pg||
nt|athene: it could easily give tricks away|pg||
nt|athene: i assume that @D4 is the @H4|pg||
nt|hawe45:  East found the shift|pg||
nt|andreasw:  if denmark wins now free beer for all|pg||
pc|h6|nt|xenya: N was sort of endplayed on the lead -- any suit he might lead (except @Cs) gives away a trick|pg||
nt|psridhar: are they saving vul vs nv on a 4-4? looks 500 to me|pg||
pc|s6|nt|paulg:  12 tricks looks a lot at the other table|pg||

nt|haans: soonest|pg||
nt|vasmar: i think that in hearts there are a lot of tricks for N-S|pg||
nt|pitiful:  should make 10 on the layout|pg||
pc|hK|nt|santyclz: @c back looks safer than @d.|pg||
nt|mcarroll: Still tempting though|pg||
nt|shevek: coffee hand is when you need to go to the bathroom and pretend you go to the kitchen :)|pg||
nt|chick: in any case, EW found a makeable game|pg||
nt|chick: won't be easy with the awful trump split, but he has a lot of resources outside of trump|pg||
nt|me argent: tout marche pour lui|pg||
pc|h7|pg||

nt|ritong: mais ça marchera|pg||
pc|d2|nt|paulhac:  Looks like 12 on this lead also|pg||
nt|vasmar: now 1NT will go 1 off probably|pg||
nt|vasmar: 4 hearts + 3 Aces|pg||
nt|jameslee 2: but seems a 500 againtx a 420|pg||
pc|d6|nt|mcarroll: not enough dummy entries to trap @HK so will lose 2@D,1@S and the @HK|pg||
nt|haans: sweden DOWN|pg||
nt|roswolf: 3@D should be gf and if so west could have bid 3@S when a slam would be reached|pg||
nt|lechcold: do taryfy chyba brakuje 2 Impów?|pg||
pc|dK|nt|athene: declarer really played a diamond, not a trump, at trick 2?|pg||
nt|santyclz: Doesn't seems likely.|pg||

nt|rnmalik: Cant play @S that would squeeze the hand.|pg||
mc|10|nt|eweber: ... or play 1@c|pg||
nt|lmeili: wd!|pg||
nt|MolvaM: coffee hands are the type of hands that allow you to go and get a cup of coffee from the kitchen without worrying about what extremely clever remark you can do here as commentator|pg||
nt|tomi2:  he knows now @DQ in north, so not many points left for south. maybe some bad clue, but better than no clue ;)|pg||
nt|othered1: north might have ruffed to play @S through, at possible cost of trump trick|pg||
nt|tomi2:  I am told that the systematic meaning of xx is "10+, often no @H fit", hmm|pg||
