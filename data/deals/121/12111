pc|sQ|mc|11|nt|paperika: he will support spades. but it's very important that if you are going to lie, better to pick just 1 suit, rather than lieing over 3|pg||
nt|sybarra: ok so I am not an expert |pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 nt might have been option |pg||
nt|paperika: so your partner must be aware that clubs might be a ghost suit|pg||
nt|rodal f: 2@H = 5cards and force|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 nt  should be 3 card support,  balanced etc |pg||
nt|rodal f: By 14HP?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Taking all space away if slam|pg||
nt|sybarra: 14  but but not a bad 14,  as I said, I really had little problem with 2 @h,  and 2 @C I do NOT like|pg||
nt|sybarra: but it style and partnership stuff,  to each his/her own|pg||
nt|rodal f: Style by persons|pg||
nt|jrawlings: wolf, can you please tell us if there are running scores posted somewhere on the www ?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Have not had to 2 last days, but the serviceminded Veena might can find something:)|pg||
nt|jrawlings: yes rodal, let's see if we can get the scores on the mcba web-site .. would be nice to know how the teams are doing |pg||
nt|jrawlings: looks  like the match has been scored at 40-42 for mcba1 |pg||
nt|jrawlings: ah, here's a correction ..32-53|pg||
nt|sybarra: so that was last?  |pg||

nt|jrawlings: we are @@ the mercy of the internet connectivity of the federal hotel |pg||
nt|rodal f: At least its nice to have u as a person who have more control then the co commentators and specs:) Nice info, but unoficial|pg||
nt|jrawlings: tx wolf, tx specs, see you after lunch-break, shd be about 45 minutes|pg||
nt|sybarra: and time for lunch at the venue?|pg||
