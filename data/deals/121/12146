nt|xenya: very different|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: and north doubles for a club lead|pg||
nt|xenya: i wouldn't bid this hand like EW did|pg||
nt|mmmakela: will get 9 my bet|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: but the contract is a make it seems...|pg||
nt|mmmakela: spades and clubs ideally for decl|pg||
pc|cA|nt|wilkinsona: declarer can keep norths clubs out of the picture |pg||
nt|xenya: 3N does look a stretch, and N's double is --er -- a bit optimistic|pg||
pc|c5|pc|c2|pc|c3|pg||
pc|c8|nt|xenya: he does have clubs but he doesn't have an entry|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 3+2+3+1|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c9|nt|wilkinsona: K is +1, and declarer may think he needs that |pg||

nt|athene: but what is their NT range?|pg||
nt|vugraphzye: This 1NT is 12-16|pg||
nt|athene: with a balanced 16 you would expect them to open 1NT or 1@C with a 1NT rebid|pg||
pc|cJ|nt|athene: what would a 1NT opener be?|pg||
nt|justin c: 12-16 is quite a range|pg||
nt|roswolf: my thanks to my fellow commentators Justin and Bill and to our hardworking operator Michael|pg||
nt|athene: easier for declarer to get this suit right if the @CJ lead denies the @CK, of course|pg||

pc|h4|pc|d4|pc|h5|pc|h8|pg||

pc|hA|nt|justin c: one off i guess|pg||
nt|justin c: could be worse |pg||
nt|athene: he is a big advocate of leading small from two honours in those situations, because so often you just build a trick for declarer's cards otherwise|pg||

nt|xenya: playing a strong NT, EW would have probably landed in 2@S -- i wonder if that was available here|pg||
