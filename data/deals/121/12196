nt|athene: 2@D multi, 3@D 4441, then 3@H asking range?|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: and lots of tricks it seems|pg||
nt|athene: Forrester was presumably intending to pass if his partner rebid 3@S, showing 16-18|pg||
pc|c7|nt|athene: 4441 hands are tricky but i am not convinced you need to devote special bids to handling them|pg||
nt|athene: without any cunning science you can just bid 2nt 3@C 3@S 4@S :)|pg||
nt|ady: will need to take the simple spade finesse to make|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Yes, William, but these bids often free up the rest of the system|pg||
nt|justin c: not a bad idea to include big 3 suiters in a multi opening|pg||
nt|justin c: opening 2NT with 4144 hardly ideal|pg||
nt|athene: there's a minor-suit defensive crossruff looming|pg||
nt|athene: so he needs to get the trumps out the way very quickly|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yes it looks natural for declarer to play a diamond..|pg||
nt|athene: but even if he was intending doing something cute, the appearance of the @SJ should simplify matters|pg||
pc|c2|pc|cT|pc|cK|pg||

pc|s2|pc|sK|pc|sA|pc|s7|pg||
nt|athene: nice @SK|pg||
nt|athene: if he had played the @SJ, declarer would be pretty much forced into the right line|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yes, give declarer a problem|pg||

nt|justin c: and new leaders|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: well thats a great defence really..|pg||
nt|ady: made in OR     new leaders|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: don't really think declarer was wrong..|pg||
mb|1D|mb|p|mb|1H|mb|p|nt|justin c: i was wondering about that|pg||
mb|1S|mb|p|nt|justin c: can declarer succeed if @S are really 4-1?|pg||
mb|2C|mb|d|mb|p|mb|p|nt|athene: not by leading a top diamond - he must lose @DA, club, two trumps in that case|pg||
nt|justin c: maybe he should just plunk down the @SQ then|pg||
mb|3C|mb|p|nt|athene: if 2@C is traditional 4th suit forcing it's pushy since most play that as GF|pg||
nt|justin c: opposite a limited opening, would be very pushy|pg||
nt|justin c: 3@D more to the point|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: 2@C is some sort of 2 way bid and promises no extras |pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|nt|athene: a simple 3@D limit bid would be best, surely, over 1@S - but only if 1@D actually promised some diamonds|pg||
mb|4D|mb|p|nt|justin c: west figures that all his values are in the right places|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: i think there may a slight mixup here...|pg||
mb|5D|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|justin c: would think that knowing about @C wastage in east would put a damper on this auction tho|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: ok - 1@S was @D and @S or a heart raise|pg||
nt|vugraphzyf: 2@C asked|pg||
nt|athene: the traditional defender's dilemma here for north|pg||
pc|c5|nt|athene: if you play the @CA, you give declarer two club tricks|pg||
pc|c4|nt|athene: but if you don't, you don't get it|pg||
nt|ady: might make  on a semi cross ruff 5 side suit winners including 2 clubs   will need 6 trump tricks|pg||
nt|athene: you have to decide if declarer's problem is too many losers or not enough winners|pg||
nt|athene: it's doubly hard here because north might not even be certain east has the @CKQ :)|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: looking again at the bidding it seems pretty good to me|pg||
nt|ady: if north ducks    may make with 7 trump tricks on cross ruff and 4 side suit winners|pg||
pc|cA|pc|c6|pg||
nt|ady: trump lead was best here|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: if north ducks there are 12 tricks it seems|pg||
pc|d3|pc|dJ|pc|dK|pc|dA|pg||
nt|athene: lots of possibilities here for declarer|pg||
pc|h3|pc|h6|pc|hA|pc|h5|pg||
pc|cK|pc|c9|nt|athene: you could finesse spades, playing for either @SQ onside or 3-3 spades|pg||
pc|h4|nt|justin c: might lay down the @SAK to try for @SQ doubleton, planning on pitching a @S on a @C if it doesnt appear|pg||

pc|sA|pc|s3|pc|sJ|pc|sQ|pg||
nt|athene: nice to know north has the club length so there's no danger of overruffs there|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: avoid a club now tho|pg||
nt|athene: now club ruff, heart ruff|pg||
nt|athene: the diamond spots start getting interesting|pg||
nt|ady: forester canpitch K@H next club to try to confuse matters|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: no|pg||
nt|ady: maybe ruff with 8@D|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yep|pg||
pc|c2|nt|justin c: @S ruff hi, @D to @D10, @C ruff, @H|pg||
pc|d8|nt|wilkinsona: spade is ok|pg||
nt|athene: it was better perhaps, as suggested, to lay down the @SAK before pitching the spade on a club|pg||
nt|justin c: this is in trouble now|pg||
nt|athene: the point being, if the @SQ drops doubleton, you have another winner available in the @SJ|pg||
nt|justin c: that keeps more chances alive, doesnt it|pg||
nt|athene: but if you aren't planning on drawing trumps, you can't cash the @SJ anyway|pg||
nt|athene: you don't want to let them ruff it and play a second trump|pg||
