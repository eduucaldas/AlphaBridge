nt|vugraphzak: auction guaranatees 5@d in N|pg||
pc|s6|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: south admitted to a balanced hand eventually|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: we can see that the cards are lying well for declarer|pg||
nt|xenya: anyhow, 3N is quite trivial and should be reached on any system |pg||
nt|mmmakela: still 2 @D with bad 5-carder seems strange|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ...but Stuart Tredennick will be considering what to do versus bad lies|pg||
nt|rnmalik: see any future for this 3NT|pg||
nt|xenya: :)|pg||
pc|s2|nt|xenya: again, EW in the OR reached 3N with a suit inadequately guarded|pg||
nt|xenya: no -- not with 4-2 @Ds|pg||
pc|s7|nt|wilkinsona: well at least they had a diamond overcall vs a take out x in OR|pg||
nt|xenya: the same thing happened here, though now 5@C would be excellent|pg||
pc|s9|pc|hJ|pg||
nt|yo_yo: no idea what they are|pg||

nt|rnmalik: The play of AK@H makes|pg||
nt|xenya: actually he can make an overtrick now -- but will he come to 10?|pg||
nt|xenya: i think he will|pg||
mb|p|nt|yo_yo: it's a weak double  but with both majors  in he came|pg||
mb|4N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|dK|nt|wilkinsona: well, adventurous contract, but|pg||
nt|yo_yo: he wont find the @D lead i guess|pg||
nt|rednaxela: 2NT suggest 15-17, which is a bit of an overstatement.|pg||
nt|xenya: meanwhile Collins have increased the lead to 32 imps|pg||
pc|d2|nt|wilkinsona: somewhat different auction to OR|pg||
nt|xenya: very different|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: and north doubles for a club lead|pg||
nt|xenya: i wouldn't bid this hand like EW did|pg||
nt|mmmakela: will get 9 my bet|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: but the contract is a make it seems...|pg||
nt|mmmakela: spades and clubs ideally for decl|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ...has a chance...|pg||
pc|d3|nt|wilkinsona: declarer can keep norths clubs out of the picture |pg||
nt|xenya: 3N does look a stretch, and N's double is --er -- a bit optimistic|pg||
nt|xenya: this should be down 1 |pg||
nt|xenya: even if he misguesses @Hs, he is almost certain to get @Cs right|pg||
nt|rnmalik: 2@C, @D and a @H-no |pg||
nt|xenya: sorry i was a bit rash it seems|pg||
nt|xenya: same problem in trumps|pg||
nt|rnmalik: S should count the losers and only makes he reduces his losers to 3 from 4|pg||
nt|xenya: well of course he can win now and play another club but that would be far from safe|pg||
nt|rnmalik: anothe @C-A and back|pg||
pc|d5|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: or 2|pg||
pc|dT|nt|wilkinsona: now just set up a spades for 9|pg||
pc|s2|nt|yo_yo: 3@S, 5@C 1@D and 1@H|pg||
pc|d9|nt|xenya: he does have clubs but he doesn't have an entry|pg||
nt|mmmakela: 3+2+3+1|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: perhaps a spades switch more accurate but with the clubs so bad this seems -1|pg||
pc|dA|pg||
pc|c2|nt|wilkinsona: K is +1, and declarer may think he needs that |pg||
nt|yo_yo: no, they get 4 tricks|pg||
pc|d4|pc|cJ|nt|rednaxela: 'Only' needs the Q@c dropping and Hearts 4-4 now.|pg||
nt|xenya: well declarer has 6 trump tricks, an ace an a spade ruff|pg||
pc|cA|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: I reckon if you plan to pull 3N, may be better to bid 3 spades over 3 diamonds|pg||
pc|h8|pc|hA|nt|yo_yo: he might finesse @C?|pg||
pc|h4|pc|h3|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, he would have down on that line|pg||
pc|s8|nt|wilkinsona: afraid so..|pg||
nt|yo_yo: so much easier double dummy ....|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Indeed.|pg||
pc|s7|nt|xenya: you have to be quite careless to go 2 off here|pg||
nt|xenya: but this is even worse|pg||
pc|sA|nt|rnmalik: agree-badly played|pg||
pc|s4|pg||
pc|c8|nt|wilkinsona: we can see the cards, and south perhaps likely to have a singleton club after the x|pg||
nt|yo_yo: agree|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Mind you, he left himself with no entry for the Spade finesse.  Suppose North had covered the J@c?|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 7@C?|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Ah, yes.  Still had a smaller pip.  Should have played the 8 or 9 under the Jack.|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Gerald Tred working out the distribution|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: looks like a spade at trick 3, then|pg||
nt|vugraphzak: South deep in thought|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i wonder what message @H 8  was?|pg||
nt|rednaxela: He may be wondering where declarer's high cards are for his 2NT.  Really needs a Diamond honour but wouldn't have played the suit that way if he had one.|pg||
nt|yo_yo: i bet @D 10 is coming|pg||
nt|vugraphzak: South's brow still furrowed|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Sime back in the lead.  5 imps on the previous board where 2@s went off against 1@s made at this table.|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: couple os small swings put the Sime team back in front but that may be short lived..|pg||
pc|c3|nt|xenya: what a relief for E to see the @DQ|pg||
pc|c5|pc|h6|pg||
pc|h5|nt|xenya: the auctions in both rooms were practically identical except that in the OR S passed over N's 4@S -- here he bid 4N|pg||

pc|cK|pc|d6|nt|wilkinsona: thats a line..|pg||

mb|p|nt|rednaxela: We have been too high for the last three bids.  Will it stop?|pg||
nt|xenya: 4 more to come|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: yes, but if he bid 3 spades first he would then pass 3N|pg||
pc|hA|nt|xenya: true|pg||
pc|h5|nt|mmmakela: E promising 15-17 now|pg||
nt|xenya: 1N=15-17|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: last board of this set.. thanks everyone, next set starts 2pm GMT|pg||
pc|h2|nt|wilkinsona: and straight into bat again..|pg||
nt|mmmakela: if covers 7&8 guarantee a stopper|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: not so easy to see where tricks come from here..|pg||
nt|xenya: playing a strong NT, EW would have probably landed in 2@S -- i wonder if that was available here|pg||
nt|yo_yo: 6@D?|pg||
nt|rednaxela: too high to make, I meant.  5@c was obviously a great save.|pg||
pc|hJ|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: thats a well judged pass of 4 clubs by John Matheson...|pg||
nt|xenya: he could hardly do that in their methods i guess|pg||
nt|vugraphzak: 2 Heart - reverse attitude, suit preference|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hK|nt|wilkinsona: oops..|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: that pass by Bif...|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ...invites the wrong decision...|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Converting to 6@d gave E/W two more chances to go wrong at no extra cost!|pg||
nt|yo_yo: Sanders is wondering what the pass meant|pg||
nt|yo_yo: if it gave him  a choice, he might go on|pg||
nt|xenya: 3N looks quite playable here -- the 2@D opening (somewhat unorthodox perhaps) seems to have worked well|pg||
nt|xenya: this requires careful play|pg||
pc|h3|pc|s2|pg||

pc|dA|pc|d2|nt|xenya: not that 2@S is much better on this layout|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes  |pg||

pc|d4|pg||
pc|hT|pc|c4|pc|h9|nt|wilkinsona: it is, but after this sequence to odds that 2 spades is preferable have changed|pg||

nt|rednaxela: Well, well!|pg||
