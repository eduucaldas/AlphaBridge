nt|hedyg: Giorgio even|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Giorgio, i am from Italy Hedy :)|pg||
nt|hedyg: yes sry |pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: 3 NT - if they can bid it|pg||
nt|hedyg: ciao Gio :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: hi all again!|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: Lucchesi have 10 imps to catch up on|pg||
mb|1N|mb|p|mb|p|nt|bridge_one: note italy pair don't use frequently to open weak 2 suit (south)|pg||
nt|hedyg: right, 2suiter|pg||
mb|p|pc|c6|nt|lestergold: 3N should go off on careful defence|pg||
nt|hedyg: but might it now before pd leads a @c|pg||
nt|hedyg: nope|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 1nt possible, 2Nt long to make - so 2@s open would work here|pg||
pc|c8|pc|c3|nt|lestergold: nko reason for the stiff KC to be found|pg||
nt|hawe45:  To me Easts hand more looks like a @C-@d reverse hand - no intermediates for NT|pg||
pc|c2|pg||
nt|bridge_one: and the lead would be @S, not @c|pg||
pc|h5|nt|hedyg: seems 2@H was forcing..|pg||
pc|h6|nt|wilkinsona:  unless its led|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|hA|pg||
nt|sharkey: Assuming a @S lead dont think you need @C finesse|pg||
nt|lestergold: here declafrer can afford the safety play|pg||
nt|hedyg: not really enough for reverse|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Sure - but minimum!|pg||
nt|hawe45:  The @H-suit brings this 3 NT safely home|pg||
nt|hedyg: on a @s lead...|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Whatever lead|pg||
nt|bridge_one: guess @h help the declarer|pg||
pc|s6|nt|lestergold: but we were deprivd of watchi9ng for it|pg||
nt|hedyg: and a @d switch..|pg||
pc|s2|pc|sQ|pc|sK|pg||
nt|hawe45:  YES - take @S Ace and play @H|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: cambiaghi apologize for his bid|pg||
nt|hedyg: :)|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: franco saved him|pg||
nt|xenya: this one might not be easy|pg||
nt|irwinbo: he will now make it|pg||
nt|hedyg: actually the @c gave nothing, declarer would have played small @c to jack|pg||
nt|bridge_one: for sure - also more that one|pg||
nt|bridge_one: Hi Irwin :)|pg||
pc|h2|pc|h3|nt|hedyg: so 2 @H was nf?|pg||
pc|h8|nt|sharkey: indeed - and here it will be difficult to get a @C ruff|pg||
pc|hT|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|lestergold: without club lead declarer can afford to bang down club ace before leading up to it to cater for the KC stiff|pg||

nt|hawe45:  Listen: We have 4 @H, 3 @C + 2 ACES - here in Denmark the total is 9|pg||
nt|xenya: yes, but how do you know you have 4 hearts?|pg||
nt|hawe45:  That combines 3-3 @H OR 3-3 @C - not so bad|pg||
pc|dA|pc|dK|nt|hedyg: you play A@H and @H ducked and then?|pg||
pc|d9|pg||

nt|bridge_one: weak NT (may be not vuln, o am not sure if they play weak Nt also vul)|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|nt|vugraphztg: both of pairs|pg||
nt|hedyg: @H suit got lost|pg||
nt|hedyg: W could double 1@s and correct a @c bid by pd to @d|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: EO to play, NS defense|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Makes played by E - otherwise has to guess @S|pg||
nt|sharkey: may be the first swing board|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  but 5 hearts went -2 OR|pg||
nt|lestergold: maybe trying to make 5 lost an extra trick|pg||
nt|bridge_one: the pass of north natural - strange playing weak nt|pg||
pc|s6|nt|hedyg: W is endplayed|pg||
pc|sT|nt|sharkey: assume misguessed @S - finesse |pg||
pc|s4|nt|lestergold: maybe dim lead took spade finesse? to pitch dim??|pg||
nt|wilkinsona:  appears to be so|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: no i 'm wrong|pg||
pc|s2|pg||

nt|hedyg: pd i opened 1@S!|pg||
nt|hedyg: pls lead my suit!|pg||

pc|dQ|pg||

pc|c4|nt|wilkinsona:  diamond lead, ruffing spade hook diamond pitch and led a club up allowing a ruff|pg||
nt|lestergold: a very expensive foray that was|pg||

pc|h4|pg||
pc|dK|nt|bridge_one: not more that 6 tricks for defence|pg||

mb|p|mb|1N|mb|p|nt|wilkinsona:  Lauria played carefully just to lose 2 clubs|pg||
nt|lestergold: e/w did wll to bid game here- finding a perfect fit|pg||
nt|Walddk2: West passed, and East had an interesting three-suited 2@C opening available next door|pg||

nt|bridge_one: weak Nt in all vuln|pg||
mb|2C|mb|p|mb|2D|nt|Walddk2: 2@D relay, 2@H singleton spade|pg||
nt|lestergold: likely to be bid here also now|pg||
mb|p|nt|ralfwil: the safe contract, but @hA is on side, so the problem is to find 6@d|pg||
nt|hedyg: NS system : http://bridgewithdan.com/systems/Fiori_Napoletano.txt|pg||
nt|xenya: finding a fit in a minor after 1N opening is often a problem|pg||
mb|3N|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|hedyg: sry 1 NT= 13-16 then?|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: i bid 3@s with S cards|pg||
nt|bridge_one: @S beat|pg||
pc|h4|nt|ralfwil: agree vladimir, but 3nt from S gave no options|pg||
nt|hawe45:  In the northern part of Europe, you are NOT allowed to pass a hand like EastÂ´s|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: at least 5-4 minors short in @s ga,e try or more|pg||
nt|vugraphztg: more east to find 6@d|pg||
nt|hedyg: in the rest of the world neither|pg||
nt|hedyg: now 9 tricks easy|pg||
pc|hQ|nt|lestergold: 11 tricks appear possible if defenders fail to draw some trumps|pg||

mb|p|pc|dQ|nt|hawe45:  The wrong hand is playing here - most of us bid 2 NT as East - after pdÂ´s 2 @C|pg||
nt|xenya: not clear|pg||
nt|xenya: they might regret that|pg||
nt|hedyg: looks like 9 tricks if he continues @S or not|pg||
nt|hawe45:  With West as declarer, 3 NT has problems|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3nt like a xfert - In Italy we have hight invention :)|pg||
nt|irwinbo: nice lie of the cards  making 5|pg||
nt|marlowepi: so presumably 3S would relay to 3N, either to play or to show a minor-oriented slammish hand?|pg||
nt|hedyg: very few top players play 3 NT as natural nowadays|pg||

pc|hK|nt|lml: and West could have passed if it was appropriate from his hand|pg||

pc|cJ|pc|s4|pc|c7|pc|c6|pg||
nt|lestergold: spec asks what exactly did the 1 spade bid mean|pg||
nt|marlowepi: 2H seems clear to me. taking the save is not so clear. EW might have only 8 spades, and 3D did not necessarily show 5-5. S has defense and N has no shortness. also, it is not clear ...|pg||
nt|marlowepi: at all--to me, anyway--whether the pass over 4S is, or should be, forcing|pg||
nt|bridge_one: after 1@S Roland not so sure declarer can't read the same the hands - with 6@h with one+ honor few don't bid 2@h over 1@S overcall|pg||
nt|Walddk2: forcing? even thinking about it is an overbid|pg||

nt|bridge_one: Hedy, a p could be also Marshall - so i am at two :) can you look to find one for you ?|pg||
nt|marlowepi: on the first hand the D tap means you cant make 6S if E has Kxx|pg||
mb|1H|nt|sharkey: NS have a chance to regain |pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: However, 4@S can be defeated on best defence|pg||

nt|hedyg: we all have 1 like that|pg||
nt|hedyg: or give him KQ10xx - Kxx AKQxx|pg||
mb|1S|nt|Walddk2: I confess that it's impossible for West to find the heart lead|pg||
mb|p|nt|hedyg: 1@s 4 cards, canapé|pg||
mb|2C|nt|hawe45:  Easy to make - difficult to bid = 6 @D|pg||
nt|hedyg: i.e. can have longer minor|pg||
nt|marlowepi: why is that hand a problem? we will always reach spades with that hand|pg||
mb|p|nt|sharkey: Can 4@S be defeated without @H lead?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: so 3@H was ok ...|pg||
mb|2D|nt|vugraphztg: gazzilli sequence|pg||

mb|2H|nt|hedyg: ty Gio , i have a pd already :)|pg||
mb|p|nt|Walddk2: I think 4@S makes on any lead but a heart|pg||

nt|hedyg: easy on @D lead?|pg||
mb|3S|nt|sharkey: agree|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona:  doubling 4 diamonds was ok as well|pg||

mb|4H|nt|xenya: yes, but it's not a bad slam|pg||
nt|lml: well if you chose to take the heart finesse it is less than 50-50|pg||
nt|lml: the heart finesse by itself is 50|pg||
nt|hawe45:  On a trump lead, itÂ´s rather bad|pg||

mb|p|nt|ralfwil: @hQ 3rd in front.... and 12 tricks|pg||
nt|hedyg: now 2@H= @H + @c|pg||
nt|bridge_one: yes, but also 5/4 and 12 hcp|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@s is GF - otherwise 3@s directly over 2@C|pg||
nt|hedyg: 3@s would deny 8 hcps, np?|pg||
nt|bridge_one: this 4@H means 6+5+ ( i think)|pg||
nt|hedyg: direct|pg||
nt|hedyg: Clair should pass|pg||
nt|hedyg: his hcps in @s and @d not good for his pd|pg||
nt|bridge_one: 3@s over 2@c is inviting - so can have also 10 11bad - means not interest to know the hand of p|pg||

nt|Walddk2: No-one expects Pescara to win this match. You don't get many opportunities against these guys, so when you get one, like here, you simply must take advantage to stand any chance|pg||

pc|sQ|nt|ralfwil: as the cards lie, not possible to make 4@s|pg||

pc|s3|pg||
pc|hQ|pc|h7|nt|hawe45:  With North as declarer, a lousy @D-lead kills the contract -|pg||
nt|hedyg: E must switch to @d|pg||
nt|ralfwil: @cA and a @d switch...|pg||
nt|hedyg: 4@s is too passive|pg||
nt|hawe45:  Just guess the @H-suit, and you write 620|pg||
nt|ralfwil: now S has time to set up @h  after a correct guess|pg||
nt|ralfwil: no fantasy with that @s4|pg||
nt|hedyg: cannot doublefinesse in @H, needs 2 entries for that|pg||
nt|hawe45:  I normally say: If onlÃ¦y at least one of the opponentÂ´s hands is wide open (dummy) you should try to kill the contract|pg||
nt|lml: I dont think they can beat 4@S even with a bad guess because East will only get in once|pg||
nt|hawe45:  That East did NOT play @H, might signal having the King|pg||
pc|h5|pc|h2|pg||
pc|c4|nt|hedyg: if he switches to @D after A@c it is down|pg||

pc|cA|pg||
pc|dK|nt|ralfwil: but as a kib notices S can duck a small @d|pg||
nt|hawe45:  But it CAN be down|pg||
