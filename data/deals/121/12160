pc|h4|nt|xenya: i must say i don't understand 4@S|pg||

pc|hJ|nt|vugraphzak: checking cc|pg||
nt|xenya: and 3N looks particularly promising|pg||
nt|xenya: also, S might consider a double over 1@S|pg||

pc|h5|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: so might go differently elsewhere|pg||
pc|hA|nt|mmmakela: y they did "well" in OR to reach 3 NT|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: Even 1NT in danger it seems|pg||
nt|xenya: what if S switches to @Cs now?|pg||
pc|hT|nt|xenya: seems the contract will be in danger then?|pg||
pc|h7|nt|wilkinsona: yes, club could have beaten it...|pg||

mb|p|mb|2S|mb|p|nt|xenya: a very lucky game for NS here|pg||
mb|3C!|mb|p|nt|mmmakela: cig br brb|pg||
mb|3S|mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: well 9 tricks if the defence dont take the first 5|pg||
mb|p|nt|xenya: EW being somewhat cautious|pg||
mb|p|nt|wilkinsona: in fact 3N made OR|pg||
nt|xenya: they can't do that i think, with @Hs blocked|pg||
pc|s9|nt|rnmalik: badly played no other reason|pg||
pc|s5|pc|s7|nt|yo_yo: The Tredinnick twins were in the final last year |pg||
nt|rednaxela: Can't say I'd have found that lead.|pg||
nt|yo_yo: if my memory is correct they lost to the De Botton team|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: yep|pg||
pc|sT|pg||
pc|h7|pc|hA|nt|wilkinsona: they can, though..south opened 1 spade 3rd place and got an unwanted spades lead|pg||
nt|vugraphzak: It's a cue bid!|pg||
nt|xenya: but naturally, W is reluctant to bid 3N with @Hs wide open -- as he might suspect|pg||
pc|h2|nt|yo_yo: they won an  IBPA award for the  Precision best bid hand of the year: http://personal.eunet.fi/pp/lneimo/2009_IBPA_Awards.pdf|pg||
pc|h4|pg||
nt|xenya: 10 tricks but game is hard to reach even after N has opened|pg||
nt|rnmalik: true|pg||
nt|xenya: so a flat board|pg||
pc|s4|pc|sQ|pc|s2|nt|xenya: but to be fair, it's not quite obvious where and how they could get in|pg||
pc|s3|pg||
nt|xenya: as a result, they reach a hopeless minor-suit game|pg||
pc|hK|pc|hQ|nt|wilkinsona: ..in wrong  suit...|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: never much liked cues in bid suits...|pg||
nt|vugraphzak: Short discussion of bidding methods!|pg||

pc|h9|nt|vugraphzak: Curt even!|pg||

nt|wilkinsona: this contract comes home it seems..|pg||
nt|yo_yo: how high to ruff, he wonders|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: not too high, Kath|pg||
nt|yo_yo: McGeorge, what a great name|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: Nelson's a great name too|pg||
nt|yo_yo: I think Mc or Mac , very Scottish, means son of?|pg||
nt|rednaxela: Yes, that's right.|pg||
nt|yo_yo: yes  but no relation to the great man |pg||

pc|d2|pc|d5|pc|dJ|nt|xenya: somehow i don't think 4@D was a cuebid, though admittedly W could bid 3@H to ask about a @H stopper...|pg||

pc|s3|nt|wilkinsona: south admitted to a balanced hand eventually|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: we can see that the cards are lying well for declarer|pg||
nt|xenya: anyhow, 3N is quite trivial and should be reached on any system |pg||
nt|mmmakela: still 2 @D with bad 5-carder seems strange|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: ...but Stuart Tredennick will be considering what to do versus bad lies|pg||
nt|rnmalik: see any future for this 3NT|pg||

nt|xenya: again, EW in the OR reached 3N with a suit inadequately guarded|pg||
nt|xenya: no -- not with 4-2 @Ds|pg||
pc|dQ|nt|wilkinsona: well at least they had a diamond overcall vs a take out x in OR|pg||
nt|xenya: the same thing happened here, though now 5@C would be excellent|pg||

pc|cK|pg||
nt|wilkinsona: somewhat different auction to OR|pg||

pc|d4|nt|wilkinsona: declarer can keep norths clubs out of the picture |pg||
nt|xenya: 3N does look a stretch, and N's double is --er -- a bit optimistic|pg||
nt|xenya: this should be down 1 |pg||
nt|xenya: even if he misguesses @Hs, he is almost certain to get @Cs right|pg||

nt|xenya: same problem in trumps|pg||
