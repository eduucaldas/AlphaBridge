pc|sT|pc|s2|nt|patricck: very aggressive action by AF in the CR, I don't think I like that even for matchpoint pairs, but board 4 of a Gold Cup semi-final seems like a very risky undertaking|pg||

nt|sheila a: interesting - Robson has elected to go for @s|pg||
nt|patricck: declarer has to use the diamond entry to lead spades up, because he needs tricks in that suit and has only one heart entry|pg||

nt|cameron_1: what woudl you suggest North bid if south makes a @s game try?|pg||
nt|patricck: 4@S, which is the best game, needs the Q@S to be found and the Q@H to be guessed as well.....normally that will only happen about 28-30% of the time|pg||
nt|cameron_1: for a vul game isnt that enuf?|pg||
pc|dA|pc|d8|pc|d3|pc|dQ|pg||

nt|cameron_1: i will try to remember that, often strays well below|pg||
pc|c4|pc|d4|pc|dT|pg||
nt|patricck: that is because you win 10 imps when you make a vul game not bid in the other room, but if you fail you lose only 6 imps to the 140 scored in the other room. That encourages ...|pg||

nt|patricck: i don't like 1NT, have a lot of sympathy for 1@S, but prefer pass. If we have a minor fit we may be able to find it when opponents bid spades|pg||

nt|col3435: Pass seems OK to me, you want to keep it low on the misfit (partner might be bidding again if you bid 2@h) and you're well placed if LHO does something|pg||
nt|col3435: but it's obviously a bit of a gamble still|pg||
