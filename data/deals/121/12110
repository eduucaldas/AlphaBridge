nt|sybarra: ok so I am not an expert |pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 nt might have been option |pg||
nt|paperika: so your partner must be aware that clubs might be a ghost suit|pg||
nt|rodal f: 2@H = 5cards and force|pg||
nt|sybarra: 3 nt  should be 3 card support,  balanced etc |pg||
nt|rodal f: By 14HP?|pg||
nt|rodal f: Taking all space away if slam|pg||
nt|sybarra: 14  but but not a bad 14,  as I said, I really had little problem with 2 @h,  and 2 @C I do NOT like|pg||
nt|sybarra: but it style and partnership stuff,  to each his/her own|pg||
nt|rodal f: Style by persons|pg||
nt|jrawlings: wolf, can you please tell us if there are running scores posted somewhere on the www ?|pg||
